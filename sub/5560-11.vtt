00:00.515 --> 00:02.234
Previously on "Blindspot"...

00:02.269 --> 00:04.810
She can't remember who she
is, where she came from,

00:04.845 --> 00:07.395
nothing before she crawled out
of that bag in Times Square.

00:07.430 --> 00:09.313
All of her tattoos are brand-new.

00:09.348 --> 00:10.449
It's a treasure map.

00:10.484 --> 00:14.140
These tattoos are leading us to
increasingly dangerous places.

00:14.175 --> 00:16.276
Every time we get close to something real,

00:16.341 --> 00:18.533
it just slips through my fingers.

00:18.568 --> 00:20.132
You can't have this outside my apartment,

00:20.167 --> 00:22.093
I'm not even supposed to
have this inside my apartment.

00:22.128 --> 00:25.159
Those tattoos contain
classified intelligence.

00:25.194 --> 00:26.843
You put a civilian at great risk.

00:26.885 --> 00:29.429
This is a surveillance device,

00:29.464 --> 00:31.397
and I want it inside Jane's safe house.

00:31.432 --> 00:33.937
- No.
- You don't say no to me.

00:33.972 --> 00:37.529
I wanted a moment that was just us.

00:37.564 --> 00:40.488
Sorry we have to meet again.

00:42.401 --> 00:44.564
Who are you? What is that?

00:44.629 --> 00:45.859
<i>If you're watching this,</i>

00:45.946 --> 00:47.480
<i>the mission is going as planned.</i>

00:47.541 --> 00:48.260
<i>And I know</i>

00:48.295 --> 00:51.097
<i>that you want to find
out who did this to you.</i>

00:51.163 --> 00:54.712
<i>You did this to yourself.</i>

01:57.770 --> 01:59.995
You don't seem like yourself today.

02:02.278 --> 02:03.557
Jane?

02:03.668 --> 02:06.348
<i>You did this to yourself.</i>

02:07.589 --> 02:09.555
<i>Oscar will tell you the
rest as you need to know it.</i>

02:09.590 --> 02:12.433
<i>I know how hard this
must be for you.</i>

02:12.506 --> 02:14.870
<i>But you can trust him.</i>

02:15.624 --> 02:19.527
<i>After all... he's
following your orders.</i>

02:20.854 --> 02:22.537
<i>Good luck.</i>

02:30.092 --> 02:31.792
Don't do anything stupid.

02:31.860 --> 02:33.679
I'm here to help you.

02:55.493 --> 02:57.694
Now, you don't want to do that.

02:57.896 --> 02:58.593
I'm on your side.

02:58.628 --> 03:01.341
I don't believe you. Why would I do this?

03:01.376 --> 03:02.633
I can't tell you that yet.

03:02.668 --> 03:05.847
What is my real name? Am I Taylor Shaw?

03:05.882 --> 03:07.379
Just pu... put the gun down.

03:17.837 --> 03:19.858
I want answers.

03:20.255 --> 03:22.875
Your colleagues, the FBI,

03:22.947 --> 03:26.393
they're into some very,
very terrible things.

03:26.428 --> 03:29.694
No... they're good people
and they are my friends.

03:29.729 --> 03:31.452
Friends don't imprison you.

03:31.558 --> 03:34.053
Friends don't let the CIA
capture you and torture you.

03:34.088 --> 03:36.590
They had nothing to do with this.

03:36.789 --> 03:38.826
- No?
- No.

03:38.937 --> 03:39.968
And I'm not a prisoner.

03:40.021 --> 03:41.655
Really?

03:42.231 --> 03:44.331
Ask them to lift your detail...

03:44.511 --> 03:46.875
to stop monitoring you 24 hours a day.

03:46.941 --> 03:49.211
See what your friends say then.

03:54.739 --> 03:56.931
We used to know each other before.

03:58.157 --> 03:59.032
Yes.

03:59.120 --> 04:01.049
We were engaged.

04:01.854 --> 04:03.906
You remember?

04:03.941 --> 04:08.708
- Well, we thought you...
- Just fragments, but... I remember you.

04:08.743 --> 04:13.029
Why did we end it? Was it
because of this, whatever this is?

04:13.064 --> 04:15.994
You left very clear instructions
about how this was all gonna work.

04:16.029 --> 04:17.682
I'll tell you everything in time,

04:17.781 --> 04:19.315
but there are rules, a playbook.

04:19.351 --> 04:20.140
We've got to stick to the plan.

04:20.175 --> 04:21.902
Or I could just strap you
to that table over there

04:21.970 --> 04:24.320
and get the truth out of you right now.

04:24.355 --> 04:27.480
- No, that's not you.
- You don't know me anymore.

04:28.422 --> 04:30.793
I know you better than anyone.

04:38.728 --> 04:41.437
Now, you need to get back to the safe house

04:41.492 --> 04:43.340
before they realize you're gone.

04:43.458 --> 04:45.721
There's an old transmission tower

04:45.756 --> 04:48.080
by the water on Thornton.

04:48.189 --> 04:51.116
Get 'em to drop your detail...

04:51.222 --> 04:53.534
and I'll meet you on the roof.

04:53.644 --> 04:56.270
Do that...

04:56.790 --> 04:58.957
I'll tell you who you are.

05:03.495 --> 05:05.779
You need to talk to me, Jane.

05:05.857 --> 05:07.994
Look, I know it's frustrating,

05:08.031 --> 05:11.907
working so hard and feeling like
you're no closer to the truth.

05:12.870 --> 05:14.788
Yeah, I'm...

05:14.887 --> 05:17.658
But we are making progress.

05:17.986 --> 05:19.717
Now, the last time we spoke,

05:19.785 --> 05:23.497
we discussed setting clearer
boundaries with Agent Weller.

05:23.638 --> 05:25.243
How's that been going?

05:25.360 --> 05:26.816
Good.

05:30.454 --> 05:34.975
Is there... something
you'd like to talk about?

05:36.512 --> 05:38.314
No.

05:38.349 --> 05:43.389
_

05:50.528 --> 05:52.968
No... thank you.

05:54.938 --> 05:55.978
You got a second, boss?

05:56.013 --> 05:57.570
That was the CIA.

05:57.605 --> 06:02.231
Assistant Director Carter
is missing, presumed dead.

06:02.344 --> 06:04.160
- What?
- They found his car on a bridge

06:04.195 --> 06:06.505
in New Jersey, doors open,

06:06.540 --> 06:08.440
his ID laid out on his seat.

06:08.475 --> 06:09.307
Suicide?

06:09.342 --> 06:12.026
That's what someone wants us to think.

06:12.599 --> 06:13.612
Who'd want him dead?

06:13.647 --> 06:16.700
"Who wouldn't" might be a shorter list.

06:17.063 --> 06:18.736
What did you need?

06:19.428 --> 06:21.496
No...

06:21.884 --> 06:24.453
I just answered my own question.

06:36.424 --> 06:37.958
Morning.

06:38.149 --> 06:39.305
Morning.

06:40.311 --> 06:41.745
Jane.

06:41.914 --> 06:44.152
We should probably talk about last night

06:44.187 --> 06:47.070
and obviously... not here.

06:47.507 --> 06:50.755
I don't think we should
follow my tattoos anymore.

06:50.790 --> 06:52.415
- Why?
- These cases keep getting

06:52.484 --> 06:54.658
more and more dangerous.
They already got David killed.

06:54.693 --> 06:56.748
I mean, how much longer
till someone else gets hurt?

06:56.814 --> 06:58.628
What about all the good
that we've done, all right?

06:58.685 --> 07:01.215
And not to mention the fact these tattoos

07:01.250 --> 07:03.924
are the only way of figuring
out who did this to you.

07:04.436 --> 07:07.245
I just... if something happened to you...

07:07.280 --> 07:09.516
I know what I signed up for.

07:09.605 --> 07:11.699
We all know the risks.

07:12.803 --> 07:14.580
If you don't want to come out
in the field with us anymore...

07:14.653 --> 07:17.133
No, no, that's not...

07:18.203 --> 07:22.146
Don't you ever worry that we're
playing right into their hands?

07:22.313 --> 07:23.150
Hey.

07:23.302 --> 07:25.943
Uh, you're gonna want to see this.

07:26.513 --> 07:27.821
I thought you were taking some time.

07:27.888 --> 07:29.308
- I did.
- Patterson...

07:29.343 --> 07:31.591
I don't need time or space.

07:31.703 --> 07:33.964
I just need to do my job, okay?

07:34.294 --> 07:35.494
Okay.

07:36.312 --> 07:37.866
So what do you got?

07:37.960 --> 07:38.925
I couldn't sleep last night

07:39.021 --> 07:41.889
because I kept remembering
this number game that we...

07:42.046 --> 07:43.956
Um, anyway.

07:43.991 --> 07:47.246
So this ring of numbers
is on Jane's upper thigh.

07:47.336 --> 07:48.486
And it's pi.

07:48.521 --> 07:51.248
Only it's not pi, some
of the pieces are missing.

07:51.334 --> 07:52.512
And... oh...

07:52.580 --> 07:55.662
"Pieces of pi."

07:55.867 --> 07:58.334
Anyway, here's where the gaps are.

07:58.369 --> 08:01.856
Now take the missing numbers,
bunch of gobbledygook,

08:01.891 --> 08:04.290
until you take up these dots and arrows

08:04.325 --> 08:05.643
from underneath the numbers...

08:05.713 --> 08:08.323
- Latitude and longitude.
- Exactly.

08:08.358 --> 08:09.262
The Dark Isles,

08:09.330 --> 08:11.634
a chain of uninhabited
islands in the Black Sea.

08:11.669 --> 08:14.667
- What's there?
- Behinds a dead platinum mine, nothing.

08:14.702 --> 08:16.432
Can NRO give us some more
recent satellite images?

08:16.467 --> 08:17.299
You're looking at it.

08:17.334 --> 08:19.080
Apparently, it's not
exactly a high priority.

08:19.115 --> 08:22.872
I've expedited clearance through
the State Department to investigate.

08:22.907 --> 08:26.164
An FBI attachÃ© will meet
you in Ankara, Turkey,

08:26.230 --> 08:27.801
and escort you to the island.

08:27.863 --> 08:30.024
Our jet is waiting for you at JFK.

08:30.106 --> 08:32.798
All right, grab your go-bags.

08:32.847 --> 08:35.955
Uh... we can handle this, all right,

08:36.017 --> 08:37.984
if you want to sit this one out.

08:38.019 --> 08:39.905
Not a chance.

08:40.448 --> 08:42.808
_

08:51.316 --> 08:52.154
I got through to Mayfair,

08:52.235 --> 08:54.096
she wants an update every four hours.

08:54.131 --> 08:56.003
This place has an airstrip?

08:56.049 --> 08:59.165
The mining companies built it back
in the '80s before they moved out.

08:59.246 --> 09:00.933
That's when the pirates moved in.

09:01.101 --> 09:04.890
This island is basically a safe port
if the waters get too rough for them.

09:04.925 --> 09:09.444
But they use it too inconsistently for the
government to really do anything about it.

09:09.517 --> 09:11.682
So it's basically uninhabited.

09:11.757 --> 09:14.231
Even the birds don't like here.

09:14.717 --> 09:16.327
Hey, you okay?

09:20.697 --> 09:25.172
Yeah, uh, probably just from
the dry air on the plane.

09:25.340 --> 09:27.073
The coordinates put us right here.

09:27.216 --> 09:28.508
This is what they want us to see.

09:41.967 --> 09:44.302
It's an MD 83.

09:44.831 --> 09:45.772
That tail number.

09:45.807 --> 09:48.039
- Yeah.
- What's going on?

09:48.074 --> 09:50.163
Three months ago, a commercial
plane vanished into thin air

09:50.231 --> 09:51.912
between Istanbul and New York.

09:51.947 --> 09:53.299
They assumed it crashed into the ocean,

09:53.334 --> 09:55.630
but they never found any wreckage.

09:55.665 --> 09:58.324
- Are you saying this...
- This is the plane.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.950
We just found Pan-Asian flight 921.

10:10.224 --> 10:15.224
Sync and corrections by explosiveskull
www.addic7ed.com

10:19.691 --> 10:20.748
Everything's still here.

10:20.783 --> 10:21.962
It's like they all vanished.

10:22.063 --> 10:23.512
What the hell happened here?

10:23.656 --> 10:24.564
Must've been hijacked.

10:24.632 --> 10:26.399
But where are all the passengers?

10:26.523 --> 10:29.307
Why hijack a plane just to abandoned
it in the middle of nowhere?

10:29.342 --> 10:31.685
Berat, I'm gonna need to use your satphone.

10:31.720 --> 10:33.971
Turkish Army needs to search
this island for survivors.

10:34.006 --> 10:35.389
It won't work in the hanger.

10:35.424 --> 10:37.235
We'll need to get a good line of sight.

10:37.300 --> 10:38.750
Hey.

10:38.824 --> 10:41.247
Is Jane okay? She seems a little off.

10:41.282 --> 10:43.504
I asked her if she wants
to sit this one out.

10:43.622 --> 10:44.491
She said, "No."

10:44.526 --> 10:47.053
Jane's tough, she's never
gonna sit herself out.

10:47.425 --> 10:48.488
I'm just starting to see some cracks.

10:48.554 --> 10:51.735
If we push her too hard, she'll break.

10:55.758 --> 10:57.007
Berat, what are they saying?

10:57.107 --> 10:58.478
I don't know, they're not speaking Turkish.

10:58.513 --> 11:00.242
Stop talking!

11:07.249 --> 11:09.510
FBI? FBI?

11:09.545 --> 11:12.108
I'm from Turkey. These are my guests.

11:12.143 --> 11:13.507
We were just doing a
survey of the island...

11:16.120 --> 11:18.710
You are FBI, huh?

11:18.745 --> 11:22.696
Yes, we're FBI. And who are you?

11:29.070 --> 11:30.999
Good day, Assistant Director Mayfair.

11:31.034 --> 11:33.804
Chief Inspector Fischer,
this can't be good.

11:33.885 --> 11:36.352
This unfounded negativity
that you're directing

11:36.426 --> 11:38.743
towards the Office of
Professional Responsibility,

11:38.778 --> 11:41.699
it's... it's poor leadership, Bethany.

11:41.765 --> 11:44.880
My negativity isn't unfounded
and it's not directed towards

11:44.915 --> 11:47.517
the Office of Professional Responsibility.

11:47.599 --> 11:48.814
What do you want, Jonas?

11:48.883 --> 11:50.727
I don't want anything.

11:50.793 --> 11:51.952
This is just a friendly heads-up

11:51.987 --> 11:53.642
to let you know that I'm opening an inquiry

11:53.715 --> 11:55.916
into the death of David Wagner.

11:56.893 --> 11:59.132
That case was resolved.

11:59.201 --> 12:00.489
Hmm.

12:00.618 --> 12:02.632
The perpetrators of the
crime were identified,

12:02.721 --> 12:05.169
but Mr. Wagner died as a direct result

12:05.244 --> 12:08.434
of his unsanctioned involvement
in a classified FBI case.

12:08.506 --> 12:10.767
One of my agents consulted him.

12:10.802 --> 12:13.403
Yes, consulted him, a civilian.

12:13.674 --> 12:15.441
And you consented to this?

12:15.643 --> 12:17.261
Yes.

12:17.324 --> 12:19.905
It's also come to my attention
that Special Agent Patterson

12:19.968 --> 12:23.449
removed several highly classified
files from this office illegally

12:23.491 --> 12:25.080
and left them in Mr. Wagner's possession.

12:25.115 --> 12:26.894
It's a little more complicated than that.

12:26.929 --> 12:31.691
That's why my investigation is
going to be extremely thorough.

12:31.810 --> 12:33.462
You know, I'm a little concerned
that you don't seem to see

12:33.537 --> 12:35.967
the gravity of these infractions.

12:36.074 --> 12:37.934
Patterson is a good agent.

12:37.969 --> 12:41.654
A good agent who got her boyfriend killed.

12:41.762 --> 12:43.002
Hmm...

12:43.080 --> 12:46.676
Well, if Agent Patterson's
available, I'd like to get started.

12:46.754 --> 12:49.020
Let me talk to her first.

12:49.121 --> 12:53.211
No. That's not how this works.

12:54.264 --> 12:57.166
How did you know of this place?

12:59.154 --> 13:01.787
Brave FBI man, huh?

13:02.369 --> 13:04.788
How do you know of this place?

13:15.731 --> 13:17.932
You don't answer, they pay.

13:18.367 --> 13:20.067
I'm gonna kill you.

13:22.743 --> 13:25.545
How do you know of this place?

13:28.218 --> 13:29.749
Is there anyone else with you?

13:31.349 --> 13:33.114
What do you know about our mission, hmm?

13:34.724 --> 13:37.583
Who knows you're here, huh?!

13:37.949 --> 13:38.915
You do.

13:46.345 --> 13:48.479
_

13:48.702 --> 13:50.943
_

13:52.123 --> 13:54.131
_

13:54.608 --> 13:56.031
_

13:56.105 --> 13:57.076
_

13:57.140 --> 13:58.375
_

13:58.768 --> 14:00.192
_

14:05.622 --> 14:07.513
_

14:10.302 --> 14:11.569
Uhh!

14:12.359 --> 14:13.726
Oh!

14:18.791 --> 14:20.502
Turkish coffee?

14:20.537 --> 14:21.216
- No.
- You know, I've had

14:21.251 --> 14:22.672
the warm water they call coffee here.

14:22.707 --> 14:25.116
This is far superior, believe me.

14:25.922 --> 14:28.633
Uh, I'm... I'm fine.

14:28.668 --> 14:29.852
Mmm.

14:29.887 --> 14:31.297
Let me start by saying

14:31.332 --> 14:33.849
that what happened to Mr. Wagner

14:33.884 --> 14:35.548
was a terrible tragedy.

14:35.616 --> 14:38.277
And, what's worse, it was a tragedy

14:38.312 --> 14:41.226
that was completely avoidable.

14:41.311 --> 14:44.023
So I hope you can
appreciate that it's my job

14:44.114 --> 14:47.525
to make sure something like
this never happens again.

14:49.004 --> 14:50.724
Let's start with the basics.

14:50.810 --> 14:53.319
When was the first time you
removed classified documents

14:53.387 --> 14:55.221
from the FBI's New York Office,

14:55.271 --> 14:57.947
what did you do with these
documents once you removed them,

14:57.982 --> 15:00.740
and were you aware at the time
that you were breaking federal law?

15:07.626 --> 15:10.173
I mean, look...

15:10.294 --> 15:12.735
everyone brings their work
home with them sometimes.

15:12.786 --> 15:14.435
They do?

15:14.523 --> 15:16.961
Who else is bringing classified
documents home with them?

15:17.020 --> 15:18.547
- No, I just...
- You just said that

15:18.633 --> 15:20.974
everyone brings their work
home with them sometimes.

15:21.009 --> 15:24.504
Can you give me some examples?

15:27.520 --> 15:30.269
Then would you like to
revise your statement?

15:30.406 --> 15:31.667
Let's try again.

15:31.702 --> 15:33.633
When was the first time you
removed classified documents

15:33.668 --> 15:35.285
from the FBI's New York Office,

15:35.320 --> 15:37.824
where did you store these
documents once you removed them,

15:37.859 --> 15:41.180
and were you aware at the time
that you were breaking federal law?

15:45.103 --> 15:46.858
"Final preparations."

15:46.893 --> 15:48.627
You sure that's what they said?

15:48.662 --> 15:50.865
Pretty sure, my Urdu's okay, not great.

15:50.976 --> 15:52.233
That flag in the room back there,

15:52.268 --> 15:53.411
that was Dabbur Zann.

15:53.446 --> 15:56.380
The fist, the wasp... it's gotta be them.

15:56.415 --> 15:58.583
The ones who were trying to make
the dirty bomb back in New York?

15:58.618 --> 16:00.414
- That's what they're doing here?
- I don't know.

16:00.449 --> 16:02.481
But they hate that U.S. is
meddling in the Middle East.

16:02.516 --> 16:03.801
They vowed to burn us down.

16:03.905 --> 16:06.272
Whatever it is they have planned,
it's not gonna be good for us.

16:06.370 --> 16:10.023
- We've gotta to stop them.
- Sure, let's get right on that.

16:21.330 --> 16:23.240
Oh, my God.

16:25.796 --> 16:26.765
The passengers.

16:26.800 --> 16:28.292
They're still alive.

16:39.609 --> 16:40.843
Do you speak English?

16:40.910 --> 16:43.345
I do. My name is Kurt Weller.

16:43.413 --> 16:45.581
I'm Special Agent with the FBI.

16:45.648 --> 16:46.581
This is my team.

16:46.616 --> 16:49.184
I'm Sergeant Mike Simms, NYPD.

16:49.219 --> 16:50.386
How did you know we were here?

16:50.453 --> 16:52.221
We didn't.

16:52.288 --> 16:54.990
We're investigating some
suspicious activity on the island.

16:55.058 --> 16:56.725
- And they captured you.
- Yeah.

16:56.793 --> 16:58.262
Why are they keeping you here?

16:58.297 --> 16:59.995
- It's my fault.
- Susan...

17:00.063 --> 17:01.577
My name is Dr. Susan Albright.

17:01.667 --> 17:03.255
I'm an aerospace engineer.

17:03.290 --> 17:06.067
My team was on its way back
from a conference in Istanbul,

17:06.137 --> 17:08.882
where we presented our research
in the field of micro-satellites.

17:08.978 --> 17:09.741
Micro-satellites?

17:09.825 --> 17:11.917
Small, cube-like orbital devices.

17:12.009 --> 17:13.977
3-D printing makes
them easy to manufacture

17:14.012 --> 17:15.577
and extremely cheap to launch.

17:15.645 --> 17:17.311
And the Dabbur Zann want the technology.

17:17.380 --> 17:19.048
They're forcing us to make
hundreds of those things

17:19.115 --> 17:21.126
in a factory they've retrofitted nearby.

17:21.161 --> 17:22.617
Any idea on what they were working on?

17:22.685 --> 17:24.053
Yeah, they want to located and disable

17:24.119 --> 17:26.397
the U.S. military's GPS satellites.

17:26.433 --> 17:28.175
- What?
- From the ground,

17:28.211 --> 17:30.441
the military satellites are impenetrable.

17:30.476 --> 17:31.481
But from low orbit...

17:31.516 --> 17:34.263
Right. These little
cubesats can get within range

17:34.330 --> 17:35.631
to generate a mini-EMP,

17:35.698 --> 17:37.187
which would cause a total shutdown.

17:37.222 --> 17:38.621
What does that mean?

17:38.656 --> 17:40.141
If our GPS goes down,

17:40.176 --> 17:42.574
the entire U.S. armed forces
is working in the dark.

17:42.609 --> 17:44.197
We'd never see an attack coming.

17:44.289 --> 17:46.047
And you can just launch these
satellites from the ground?

17:46.082 --> 17:48.477
No, you have to get
closer to the stratosphere.

17:48.545 --> 17:50.305
- The plane.
- Yeah.

17:50.376 --> 17:52.533
They got their hands on a Pegasus rocket.

17:52.623 --> 17:54.979
They're planning to attach
it to the plane's fuselage.

17:55.067 --> 17:57.392
The plane would get it up to 60,000 feet,

17:57.427 --> 17:58.876
the rocket would do the rest.

17:58.959 --> 18:00.760
That's why we're still here.

18:05.696 --> 18:07.667
Just one more time... it was your decision

18:07.702 --> 18:09.535
to terminate your
relationship with Mr. Wagner,

18:09.622 --> 18:11.455
is that correct?

18:11.748 --> 18:13.805
And it was at this point
that you ceased sharing

18:13.840 --> 18:16.108
confidential information with him?

18:16.831 --> 18:18.373
Yeah.

18:18.486 --> 18:20.079
After Mayfair caught us in the library,

18:20.114 --> 18:22.241
I didn't share another
photo or file with him again.

18:22.276 --> 18:24.835
Sorry... Assistant Director Mayfair?

18:26.041 --> 18:26.831
I...

18:26.866 --> 18:29.689
Uh, Assistant Director Mayfair
caught you sharing information

18:29.724 --> 18:32.227
with David Wagner at the
Brooklyn Historical Society,

18:32.262 --> 18:33.978
is that right?

18:35.032 --> 18:39.751
I mean... yes.

18:40.689 --> 18:44.770
So... up until that point,

18:44.863 --> 18:48.144
she had no prior knowledge of
you consulting with Mr. Wagner

18:48.179 --> 18:49.459
about these classified documents.

18:49.571 --> 18:52.072
She... she didn't know.

18:52.142 --> 18:54.684
No, absolutely not.

18:54.764 --> 18:58.600
I did this on my own, she
had nothing to do with it.

19:01.495 --> 19:02.662
Thank you.

19:05.443 --> 19:07.038
So you're saying they're
gonna try to launch

19:07.124 --> 19:09.425
- as soon as possible?
- That's what it sounded like.

19:09.460 --> 19:12.208
Once they launch, they'll have no
further reason to keep you alive.

19:12.243 --> 19:14.079
All right, we got to make a
play and we have to do it now.

19:14.181 --> 19:15.634
Has anyone tried to escape?

19:15.695 --> 19:18.593
I got as far as the water
once, but without a boat...

19:18.659 --> 19:20.077
Even if there was somewhere to swim to,

19:20.162 --> 19:21.919
uh, the water's freezing.

19:21.954 --> 19:24.065
You'd die of hypothermia
inside of 15 minutes.

19:24.100 --> 19:26.308
We also tried to cobble together a satphone

19:26.413 --> 19:28.353
with parts smuggled out of the factory.

19:28.439 --> 19:30.829
It was crude, only able to
send messages in Morse code.

19:30.899 --> 19:32.815
How far did you get?

19:33.472 --> 19:35.106
Not far enough.

19:35.385 --> 19:37.520
All we needed was a power source.

19:37.656 --> 19:41.254
My husband was caught
trying to steal a battery.

19:41.355 --> 19:42.986
They... they shot him on sight.

19:43.078 --> 19:45.079
And they marched the rest of us outside...

19:48.403 --> 19:50.092
...and they shot the entire flight crew

19:50.127 --> 19:51.406
right in front of us.

19:53.438 --> 19:57.140
Said they'd kill twice as many people
the next time anyone tried anything.

19:57.299 --> 19:59.407
Hadn't been much appetite
for resistance since then.

19:59.493 --> 20:01.617
I know that everyone's scared, all right?

20:01.693 --> 20:04.895
But if we do nothing, we're all gonna die.

20:05.111 --> 20:06.713
You said you got out once.

20:06.794 --> 20:08.741
- Can you do it again?
- Yeah.

20:08.790 --> 20:10.443
We loosened the bars on one of the windows.

20:10.514 --> 20:12.509
What about that satphone
you were working on?

20:12.544 --> 20:13.738
- Do you still have it?
- Yeah.

20:13.839 --> 20:15.093
We need to get to a power source.

20:15.128 --> 20:15.972
The cattle prod.

20:16.036 --> 20:17.069
We know where that is.

20:17.131 --> 20:18.284
Now, we just got to get it.

20:18.354 --> 20:19.534
How many guards are outside?

20:19.569 --> 20:20.884
Only about a dozen or so,

20:20.976 --> 20:23.232
but they're well trained
and armed to the teeth.

20:23.356 --> 20:24.199
I'll go.

20:24.325 --> 20:25.069
I'll go with you.

20:25.150 --> 20:26.342
- I'll go too.
- Mike...

20:26.457 --> 20:28.736
I know the layout of the
island, their patterns.

20:28.808 --> 20:30.075
I can help.

20:30.110 --> 20:32.542
Tasha, make sure that
satphone's ready to go

20:32.577 --> 20:34.193
the second we get back with the battery.

20:34.228 --> 20:35.339
On it.

20:35.374 --> 20:36.605
Let me go with you.

20:36.646 --> 20:39.740
These people are gonna need
you if we don't make it back.

20:41.291 --> 20:43.092
Make it back.

21:23.098 --> 21:24.698
Can I ask you something?

21:24.733 --> 21:26.968
These satellites they want you to build,

21:27.003 --> 21:30.311
if you're successful, thousands
of lives could be lost.

21:30.378 --> 21:31.947
I dragged my feet at first.

21:31.982 --> 21:35.954
I thought maybe I could buy us
time to escape or get rescued.

21:36.040 --> 21:39.810
But when they killed my
husband, the flight crew...

21:39.870 --> 21:42.171
after that...

21:42.386 --> 21:45.813
Everyone here is here because of me.

21:45.848 --> 21:48.206
I'll do whatever I have
to to keep them alive.

21:48.241 --> 21:50.476
I know that sounds crazy, but...

21:50.724 --> 21:54.085
it is the only thing
that makes sense to me.

21:54.296 --> 21:56.364
That's not crazy.

22:02.334 --> 22:04.213
Whoa, whoa.

22:07.924 --> 22:10.113
What are we supposed to do, wait 'em out?

22:14.520 --> 22:15.936
We haven't got the time.

22:15.971 --> 22:17.386
We can't take 'em out, it's too risky.

22:17.421 --> 22:19.322
So is doing nothing.

22:20.925 --> 22:22.092
Where'd he go?

22:28.214 --> 22:30.251
What's he doing in there?

22:30.330 --> 22:32.449
Nothing we can stop now.

22:42.522 --> 22:43.441
I'll draw him away.

22:43.476 --> 22:46.047
Get Mike and that
battery back to Tasha now!

22:58.733 --> 22:59.944
He's been captured? Is he...

22:59.979 --> 23:01.405
- I don't know.
- I'll go back for him.

23:01.440 --> 23:03.426
Hold on, hold on, he's
buying us some time, okay?

23:03.461 --> 23:05.762
Let's use it.

23:05.860 --> 23:08.011
- It's on.
- Who do we call?

23:08.144 --> 23:08.951
Patterson.

23:09.005 --> 23:10.403
Remember, we can only use basic tones,

23:10.438 --> 23:13.166
so a brief Morse code message
is probably our best shot.

23:13.204 --> 23:19.181
Okay, so start with:
F-B-I-N-Y-O Tat S-O-S.

23:19.216 --> 23:22.042
And then, uh... and then: P-A 921 found.

23:24.023 --> 23:26.381
Go! Move!

23:26.601 --> 23:27.849
Move!

23:28.044 --> 23:29.762
FBI, step forward!

23:29.797 --> 23:32.292
Get up! Out of the way, move, go!

23:32.327 --> 23:35.257
FBI, step forward!

23:35.749 --> 23:37.433
Get out of the way, move!

23:40.949 --> 23:42.063
Where is FBI?

23:42.185 --> 23:44.709
You come with us now!

23:57.767 --> 23:59.235
Ohh!

24:00.371 --> 24:02.858
Now I know why they kept us alive.

24:03.012 --> 24:05.980
So the whole world could see us die.

24:15.379 --> 24:18.054
They missed their scheduled check-in.

24:18.109 --> 24:20.653
So I need you to send a team to the island

24:20.688 --> 24:23.617
to make sure that they're all right.

24:24.190 --> 24:25.724
Just do it.

24:25.759 --> 24:28.174
I'm suspending Agent Patterson,
effective immediately.

24:28.263 --> 24:29.396
Absolutely not.

24:29.431 --> 24:31.871
Her actions resulted in a man's death.

24:31.906 --> 24:34.342
She's not responsible for
what happened to that boy.

24:34.377 --> 24:35.248
It doesn't matter.

24:35.283 --> 24:37.773
The moment she left this office
with those files, she broke the law.

24:37.845 --> 24:39.855
She had my permission.

24:40.872 --> 24:42.349
Did she?

24:42.524 --> 24:44.516
Because that's not what she told me.

24:44.591 --> 24:46.526
So, who's lying,

24:46.687 --> 24:49.523
your agent... or you?

24:53.240 --> 24:55.941
You know, Jonas,

24:56.357 --> 24:59.237
you're never gonna be the head of the NYO.

24:59.272 --> 25:00.988
That's a bit of a non-sequitur, Bethany.

25:01.023 --> 25:04.042
You think I don't know you've
been campaigning internally?

25:04.077 --> 25:06.922
Trying to line up allies.

25:06.957 --> 25:09.381
But first, you need me out of the way.

25:09.416 --> 25:11.707
So if I was fired and disgraced,

25:11.805 --> 25:13.749
then you could really
make a move, couldn't you?

25:13.784 --> 25:15.451
Hmph.

25:18.553 --> 25:20.993
You looked surprised.

25:22.317 --> 25:26.721
Yet another reason why you'll
never sit in this chair.

25:26.953 --> 25:29.459
Agent Patterson is suspended.

25:29.847 --> 25:31.515
If you don't like it,

25:31.778 --> 25:34.146
take it up with the Director.

25:38.219 --> 25:40.019
Read it.

25:40.134 --> 25:42.018
Read the card!

25:45.999 --> 25:48.514
You read it or you die.

25:51.385 --> 25:54.741
Either way... I die.

25:58.967 --> 26:00.764
I'm not reading that.

26:00.857 --> 26:02.695
Then one of your friends will...

26:02.850 --> 26:05.301
after they see you die slow!

26:09.356 --> 26:10.619
I'll read it.

26:10.661 --> 26:11.860
I'll read it.

26:29.170 --> 26:30.570
All right.

26:30.725 --> 26:32.693
Better get back to the barracks.

26:38.534 --> 26:41.098
Oh, God... they're going execute them.

26:41.212 --> 26:44.271
Four guards, one on each side of
the passengers, two down the middle.

26:46.725 --> 26:48.286
Far right.

26:48.389 --> 26:49.805
Far left, left.

26:49.902 --> 26:51.576
I'll take the middle.

26:52.421 --> 26:54.513
Three, two, one.

26:57.939 --> 26:59.386
They took Susan.

26:59.630 --> 27:00.936
They're gonna launch the satellites.

27:00.971 --> 27:03.156
We gotta stop that plane.

27:03.387 --> 27:04.223
Use that.

27:04.258 --> 27:06.126
Shoot anyone that's not us.

27:06.388 --> 27:08.423
Come on, it's a long way to the runway.

27:22.956 --> 27:23.842
Open! Open!

27:23.877 --> 27:25.164
Hold.

27:25.199 --> 27:27.147
All right, cover me. Moving.

27:39.351 --> 27:40.627
How many of them are there?

27:40.695 --> 27:42.662
I don't know. There's more coming!

27:51.714 --> 27:53.623
It's the passengers.

27:54.747 --> 27:57.280
What are they doing?! They're
gonna get themselves killed.

27:57.315 --> 27:58.607
Giving us a window.

27:58.642 --> 27:59.922
To do what?

28:00.189 --> 28:02.123
To get on that plane!

28:02.990 --> 28:03.923
Uhh!

28:19.725 --> 28:20.992
Agh!

28:45.747 --> 28:47.181
Why hasn't the rocket fired?

28:47.247 --> 28:49.444
We're not high enough yet.

29:14.642 --> 29:15.559
You all right?

29:15.594 --> 29:17.838
I'm fine, but we got to find
a way to stop this thing.

29:17.938 --> 29:19.640
Why? You can't shutdown the rocket?

29:19.708 --> 29:22.305
No, it's programmed to auto-launch.
The controls are in the cockpit.

29:22.340 --> 29:24.870
They just had me here as a safeguard
in case something went wrong.

29:24.948 --> 29:26.263
We need to get into the cockpit.

29:26.349 --> 29:29.446
We can't... those doors are impenetrable.

29:29.674 --> 29:31.957
Wait, so when the plane hits 60,000 feet...

29:32.067 --> 29:33.553
The rocket launches.

29:33.588 --> 29:34.747
And there's no way to stop it?

29:34.799 --> 29:36.567
Not from out here.

29:36.792 --> 29:38.352
I got an idea.

29:40.113 --> 29:41.562
This plane disappeared from traffic control

29:41.671 --> 29:43.055
three months ago.

29:43.118 --> 29:44.832
Everyone assumed it went down in the ocean.

29:44.947 --> 29:46.603
When they couldn't find any debris,

29:46.673 --> 29:48.597
they figured the transponder
had been turned off.

29:48.667 --> 29:50.004
So if we turn it back on...

29:50.072 --> 29:53.338
Yeah, hopefully someone
can see where we are.

29:53.440 --> 29:56.624
Doc, give us a hand, which
one is the transponder?

29:56.663 --> 29:58.813
Here, it's off.

30:04.496 --> 30:05.496
Can I go now?

30:05.531 --> 30:07.988
Oh, absolutely.

30:08.023 --> 30:10.395
I'm suspending you indefinitely,
effective immediately.

30:10.430 --> 30:11.972
- What? No.
- I'll need your weapon,

30:12.007 --> 30:12.988
your badge, your credentials.

30:13.023 --> 30:15.396
Please, just wait.

30:15.532 --> 30:18.147
Wait? For what?

30:18.234 --> 30:19.870
Look, you're obviously very smart,

30:19.933 --> 30:22.008
probably remotely competent,
but you're reckless.

30:22.063 --> 30:23.801
You got your boyfriend killed.

30:23.872 --> 30:25.044
Those mistakes don't just get forgiven.

30:25.110 --> 30:27.874
I'm not asking for forgiveness.

30:28.835 --> 30:31.674
I will never forgive
myself for what happened.

30:33.557 --> 30:36.584
Ugh. Please just...

30:36.796 --> 30:38.919
If I'm gonna be able to keep going,

30:39.368 --> 30:41.788
I need to find the people who did this,

30:41.823 --> 30:44.625
the people who tattooed Jane.

30:45.594 --> 30:47.061
Please.

30:47.989 --> 30:52.015
This job is all that I have.

30:52.085 --> 30:53.467
No.

30:53.569 --> 30:55.695
It's all you <i>had.</i>

30:56.872 --> 30:58.138
I need you in the lab.

30:58.173 --> 31:00.531
No, stop, Agent Patterson is suspended.

31:00.566 --> 31:02.345
- Her suspension can wait.
- Bethany!

31:02.380 --> 31:06.094
It's Assistant Director Mayfair, Jonas.

31:06.204 --> 31:08.560
I run the New York Office of the FBI,

31:08.623 --> 31:10.017
and I need my agent.

31:10.085 --> 31:12.452
You got a problem with
that, you can write me up.

31:12.508 --> 31:13.842
Let's go.

31:17.099 --> 31:19.726
It just started coming
in over your office line.

31:19.761 --> 31:21.901
Sounds like it's on a loop.

31:22.111 --> 31:22.994
It's Morse code.

31:23.029 --> 31:25.188
Well, I know that, but what's it saying?

31:25.231 --> 31:27.822
"F-B-I.

31:27.938 --> 31:31.371
"N-Y-O.
T-A-T.

31:31.465 --> 31:32.897
S-O-S."

31:32.959 --> 31:34.260
The team is in trouble.

31:34.370 --> 31:39.180
"P-A. 921...

31:39.247 --> 31:43.584
F-O-U-N-D."

31:43.699 --> 31:45.311
What does it mean?

31:45.384 --> 31:49.111
PA 921, PA 921. Why does that s...

31:49.213 --> 31:52.129
Oh, my God. Pan-Asian 921.

31:52.195 --> 31:54.229
- What?
- Hang on.

31:57.933 --> 31:59.599
Its transponder just came back online.

31:59.682 --> 32:00.509
That's impossible.

32:00.544 --> 32:01.964
It's flying over the Dark Isles right now,

32:01.999 --> 32:03.866
the same exact spot that we sent the team.

32:03.901 --> 32:05.234
42,000 feet and climbing.

32:05.269 --> 32:06.604
All right, I think they can see us now.

32:06.689 --> 32:08.749
But what now? We're still...
we're still climbing.

32:08.870 --> 32:10.104
Look.

32:16.358 --> 32:17.880
Whoa, whoa.

32:18.076 --> 32:19.041
This is not good.

32:19.076 --> 32:21.154
- What?
- The McDonnell Douglas 83s

32:21.264 --> 32:24.887
are only rated up until 45,000 feet.

32:24.942 --> 32:26.916
PA 921 just crossed 50.

32:26.995 --> 32:29.330
- Something's not right.
- Well, can we contact them?

32:29.365 --> 32:30.632
Already working on it.

32:33.214 --> 32:35.129
We're getting dangerously
close to 60,000 feet.

32:35.176 --> 32:37.082
We got to do something.

32:37.117 --> 32:38.684
All right.

32:39.541 --> 32:41.192
One shot in the fuel tank.

32:41.297 --> 32:44.148
That'll cause an explosion big
enough to bring this plane down.

32:46.848 --> 32:50.501
Jane... I'm sorry that I
brought you here, all right?

32:50.599 --> 32:53.820
I chose this life, you didn't.

32:54.126 --> 32:55.999
You never had a choice.

32:56.962 --> 32:59.313
Yes, I did.

32:59.633 --> 33:01.638
- Kurt, I...
- I'm sorry.

33:01.692 --> 33:04.641
<i>PA 921, this is
Special Agent Patterson</i>

33:04.676 --> 33:08.553
<i>from the FBI New York
Office, do you copy?</i>

33:08.631 --> 33:11.006
We copy, Patterson, this is Weller.

33:11.041 --> 33:12.406
Weller, what the hell is going on?

33:12.474 --> 33:14.425
It's a long story... basically,

33:14.460 --> 33:16.603
we have to stop this
plane hitting 60,000 feet.

33:16.638 --> 33:19.191
Okay, not a problem, the
Air Force is looped in.

33:19.245 --> 33:20.643
Are you in the cockpit?

33:20.713 --> 33:22.409
No, been locked out.

33:22.446 --> 33:23.670
We're in the avionics bay.

33:23.705 --> 33:24.901
Oh, man.

33:24.936 --> 33:27.043
Okay, we need to get you in there.

33:27.078 --> 33:28.946
Uh...

33:31.893 --> 33:35.398
I have a really bad idea
that I think will work.

33:35.461 --> 33:37.269
Okay, so what's the plan?

33:37.329 --> 33:40.229
I'm gonna walk you through
shutting the engines off.

33:40.314 --> 33:41.653
You're gonna what?!

33:53.152 --> 33:56.351
_

34:03.478 --> 34:04.745
Get up, now!

34:10.664 --> 34:12.764
Come on, come on, come on...

34:15.079 --> 34:17.313
Okay, let's give them the power back.

34:19.337 --> 34:20.670
There you go.

34:21.252 --> 34:22.891
All yours.

34:23.116 --> 34:24.993
I... I didn't...

34:25.121 --> 34:28.409
Listen, the engines
didn't start back up again.

34:28.444 --> 34:32.328
Patterson... the engines
didn't come back on.

34:32.934 --> 34:34.051
Okay, um,

34:34.085 --> 34:36.123
there's a knob on the center console

34:36.159 --> 34:37.041
that says, "Engine."

34:37.076 --> 34:39.639
Turn it clockwise
to "I-N-G Start."

34:41.292 --> 34:42.043
There you go.

34:42.110 --> 34:44.237
Okay, they still didn't start.

34:45.114 --> 34:46.646
I mean, we were basically
pulling wires down

34:46.681 --> 34:48.311
to get the plane to shut off.

34:48.346 --> 34:50.463
- We probably shorted them out.
- Patterson!

34:50.498 --> 34:53.233
I mean, I told you this
was a terrible idea.

34:55.025 --> 34:57.094
Okay, I'm gonna try to pull up.

34:57.130 --> 34:59.298
Wait! Wait! Don't pull up.

34:59.333 --> 35:00.794
What? Why?

35:00.862 --> 35:01.926
You're not that far from the runway.

35:01.989 --> 35:03.931
It's basically right below you.

35:03.998 --> 35:05.892
The plane was traveling up so fast,

35:05.955 --> 35:07.588
you haven't flown that far.

35:07.697 --> 35:08.621
<i>So?</i>

35:08.668 --> 35:11.409
Okay, okay, uh, we keep descending,

35:11.539 --> 35:13.607
you keep your knots up,
you glide into position,

35:13.703 --> 35:15.170
pull the nose up,

35:15.264 --> 35:16.376
and extend the gear at the last second.

35:16.444 --> 35:17.774
<i>And that's gonna work?</i>

35:17.859 --> 35:19.938
My dad was a pilot, not a
pro or anything like that,

35:20.002 --> 35:21.284
but he taught me a lot of...

35:21.469 --> 35:22.352
Listen,

35:22.387 --> 35:23.996
<i>fixed wing planes like this</i>

35:24.031 --> 35:27.928
<i>can glide pretty steady as
long as they keep descending.</i>

35:28.029 --> 35:30.099
You're so high up, you can
glide back onto the runway.

35:30.161 --> 35:33.395
Let me just... uh...

35:35.587 --> 35:37.964
Yes, you can for sure
maintain enough air speed.

35:38.058 --> 35:39.185
I did the math.

35:39.245 --> 35:40.334
How? Where?

35:40.401 --> 35:41.445
In my head, where math is done.

35:41.480 --> 35:42.515
Please, don't interrupt.

35:42.578 --> 35:43.619
<i>Okay, look, I...</i>

35:43.654 --> 35:44.841
I might be able to fly a plane,

35:44.917 --> 35:47.431
but how do you know that
I can land this exact one?

35:47.504 --> 35:51.729
Jane, a plane is a plane is a plane.

35:51.816 --> 35:54.970
If you've ever landed
one, you can land this one.

35:55.005 --> 35:57.084
You can do this, all right?

35:57.151 --> 35:58.619
Flying this big ol' bird,

35:58.686 --> 36:00.554
much easier than flying that chopper.

36:02.973 --> 36:05.984
Checked the bodies, no phones, no radios.

36:06.019 --> 36:07.319
Nothing yet.

36:10.201 --> 36:11.370
Look!

36:11.816 --> 36:13.940
It's coming in way too steep.

36:13.975 --> 36:15.536
<i>Not yet.</i>

36:15.689 --> 36:17.523
- Not yet.
- Come on.

36:20.540 --> 36:21.940
<i>Not yet.</i>

36:23.334 --> 36:24.845
Okay, now, pull up.

36:31.615 --> 36:33.552
I don't think we're gonna make it.

36:41.115 --> 36:42.591
<i>Break, break, break.</i>

36:49.790 --> 36:51.472
Good job.

37:05.680 --> 37:07.727
No one does what she does.

37:07.762 --> 37:10.531
She's not perfect, none of us are,

37:10.566 --> 37:12.249
but she stays.

37:12.284 --> 37:14.566
Well, there it is,

37:14.601 --> 37:16.977
the beginning of your end.

37:18.199 --> 37:19.833
Good night, Bethany.

37:33.097 --> 37:34.444
You're back.

37:34.479 --> 37:35.592
Yeah, I just got in.

37:35.627 --> 37:36.534
It's all over the news,

37:36.569 --> 37:39.099
the plane, the passengers back home,

37:39.134 --> 37:40.360
a deadly attack averted.

37:40.434 --> 37:42.750
Not bad for a couple of days work.

37:42.785 --> 37:46.475
You should all take the
day, go home, get some rest.

37:46.548 --> 37:48.799
I'd like to, um...

37:51.459 --> 37:53.403
I have a request.

37:53.438 --> 37:55.002
A request?

37:55.037 --> 37:57.226
I was wondering if we could drop my detail.

37:57.261 --> 37:59.708
I mean, I'm not under arrest, right?

37:59.743 --> 38:00.923
I'm not in custody.

38:00.997 --> 38:03.443
I'm risking my life with everyone else.

38:04.123 --> 38:06.882
And I think I've proven my loyalty by now.

38:06.917 --> 38:09.860
That detail is for your protection.

38:11.453 --> 38:14.287
It should be my choice.

38:14.525 --> 38:16.259
I think I've earned that.

38:18.054 --> 38:19.964
All right.

38:21.248 --> 38:23.230
If you continue to stay in the safe house,

38:23.297 --> 38:24.844
I'll drop your detail

38:24.972 --> 38:27.693
as long as you understand the risks.

38:29.179 --> 38:32.889
I do. Thank you.

38:52.575 --> 38:55.562
Mayfair told me she lifted your detail.

38:58.191 --> 39:00.199
Yeah.

39:00.468 --> 39:02.636
I, um... I requested it.

39:06.523 --> 39:09.681
Jane, you and I,

39:09.845 --> 39:12.962
we need to sort out some things.

39:13.041 --> 39:16.395
There's a park, it's
at the end of my street.

39:16.837 --> 39:18.955
Meet me there at 10:00.

39:19.941 --> 39:21.775
Kurt.

39:21.928 --> 39:24.471
You're crazy, Lauren B.
is gonna go all the way.

39:32.376 --> 39:33.860
See you three tomorrow.

39:33.930 --> 39:35.430
See ya.

40:30.431 --> 40:33.187
I was starting wonder if
you were ever gonna show.

40:34.197 --> 40:37.073
You were wrong, they lifted my detail.

40:37.181 --> 40:37.751
Oh, yeah.

40:37.786 --> 40:41.457
Why'd you take four subways
and three taxis to get here?

40:41.520 --> 40:43.076
They were tailing you.

40:43.187 --> 40:45.369
Apparently so were you.

40:45.529 --> 40:48.127
I had to be sure you weren't followed.

40:49.615 --> 40:51.319
They're scared of you.

40:52.013 --> 40:53.719
And they should be.

40:57.559 --> 40:59.927
Am I really Taylor Shaw?

41:02.956 --> 41:04.123
Yes.

41:06.379 --> 41:08.555
What happened to me after I was taken?

41:08.640 --> 41:11.973
Where have I been for the last 25 years?

41:12.052 --> 41:14.491
We need to learn to trust each other again.

41:14.559 --> 41:16.526
And how do we do that?

41:16.657 --> 41:18.265
Slowly.

41:20.017 --> 41:21.529
I have missions for you.

41:21.592 --> 41:23.739
Some small, some big.

41:23.863 --> 41:27.044
Things that move us
closer to our objectives.

41:27.079 --> 41:28.203
You show me you can be trusted,

41:28.270 --> 41:31.129
I'll tell you everything you want to know.

41:33.740 --> 41:35.207
No.

41:36.812 --> 41:40.552
There's some part of
you that knows I'm right.

41:40.587 --> 41:44.309
There's a part of you that...
that doesn't trust them.

41:44.398 --> 41:46.799
Otherwise, you wouldn't be here.

41:49.083 --> 41:52.218
I'm never going to hurt them.

41:52.373 --> 41:54.070
And I'm never going to put them in danger.

41:54.132 --> 41:56.944
I know it's hard for
you to imagine right now,

41:57.054 --> 42:01.139
but we, you, me, the people we work with,

42:01.174 --> 42:03.144
we're the good guys.

42:03.275 --> 42:04.469
Soon you'll come to see that.

42:04.544 --> 42:06.378
Maybe.

42:06.587 --> 42:10.745
But if we move forward,
we do this on my terms.

42:10.860 --> 42:12.993
You still don't get it, do you?

42:13.817 --> 42:16.252
These are your terms.

42:16.628 --> 42:19.082
This is all your plan.

42:20.027 --> 42:22.741
And it's time to get started.
