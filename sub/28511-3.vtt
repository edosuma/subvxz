00:00.587 --> 00:03.480
<i>Take out the translator,
that's all we asked you to do.</i>

00:03.500 --> 00:04.510
This is what
the interpreter had.

00:06.380 --> 00:09.350
<i>There's a former MI6
officer here looking for her.</i>

00:09.370 --> 00:10.490
Who did you talk to, Adam?

00:10.510 --> 00:13.360
I'm not abandoning her
for a second time.

00:13.380 --> 00:14.400
You think about the people

00:14.420 --> 00:16.400
you serve, Senator.

00:16.420 --> 00:17.480
<i>They want me to back off</i>

00:17.500 --> 00:19.320
this whole Mali thing.

00:19.340 --> 00:22.360
Everywhere your troops go
in this war

00:22.380 --> 00:24.290
<i>on terror, it just seems</i>

00:24.310 --> 00:25.320
to get worse.

00:25.340 --> 00:26.290
We're never gonna get anywhere

00:26.310 --> 00:27.480
while she has
the president's ear.

00:27.500 --> 00:31.370
I need you to put a police van
inside this checkpoint.

00:31.390 --> 00:33.350
Who is the president's
closest ally?

00:33.370 --> 00:34.400
Aminata Sissoko.

00:34.420 --> 00:36.370
We have to bring the threat

00:36.390 --> 00:37.500
to his front door, Joseph.

00:42.350 --> 00:43.490
<i>Get your guys
to find Harry Clarke.</i>

00:43.510 --> 00:45.330
<i>You follow him to Aicha.</i>

00:45.350 --> 00:47.360
<i>If I know him, he'll find her.</i>

00:51.480 --> 00:53.350
Where are we going?

00:54.490 --> 00:57.420
We have to get out of here,
out of Bamako.

00:57.440 --> 01:00.320
Harry, she's in a bad way.

It's okay.

01:29.340 --> 01:30.340
You idiots.

01:30.360 --> 01:31.490
How did you let this happen?

01:31.510 --> 01:33.370
How could you let this occur?

01:33.390 --> 01:35.300
Jesus.

01:35.320 --> 01:36.420
You want me to handle this?

01:36.440 --> 01:37.430
Would you?

01:37.450 --> 01:39.290
Please?

01:40.530 --> 01:44.380
You are idiots. You see?

01:44.400 --> 01:46.380
You see?

01:46.400 --> 01:48.300
I told you.

01:48.320 --> 01:50.380
I told you, do as I say, but no.

01:50.400 --> 01:52.340
No, you wouldn't listen to me.

01:52.360 --> 01:54.420
Okay, Joseph, take a breath.

01:54.440 --> 01:55.460
Are you going to tell me
to calm down?

01:55.480 --> 01:57.350
I wouldn't dream of it.

01:57.370 --> 01:58.500
Just tell us what happened.

01:58.520 --> 02:00.500
Your fucking colleagues.
They took her.

02:00.520 --> 02:02.360
They killed one of my soldiers,

02:02.380 --> 02:04.310
Corporal Keita,
and then they took her.

02:04.330 --> 02:06.300
And now they know what she
knows, it's a fucking mess...

02:06.320 --> 02:08.350
The interpreter...
was she wounded?

02:08.370 --> 02:09.449
Yeah, so?

02:09.470 --> 02:11.510
Where are you going?

02:11.530 --> 02:13.470
Where the fuck is he go...?

02:13.490 --> 02:14.510
Where are you going?
What the...?

02:14.530 --> 02:16.360
Adam, it's Nathan.

02:16.380 --> 02:19.300
Tell me you found the bitch.

02:19.320 --> 02:20.510
<i>Not yet, but we got a lead.</i>

02:20.530 --> 02:22.480
We're up in the Nkomi district.

02:22.500 --> 02:24.390
Any idea where
Clarke would hole up?

02:24.410 --> 02:26.310
<i>Yeah, I've got
a pretty good idea, Nathan.</i>

02:31.370 --> 02:33.280
What the fuck are you doing?

02:33.300 --> 02:35.500
I'm using my head, Joseph,
you should try it sometime.

02:35.520 --> 02:38.500
There's an old sawmill
about a half mile north of here.

02:38.520 --> 02:40.440
McKay had a security gig there,

02:40.460 --> 02:42.310
he says Clarke knows
the site well.

02:42.330 --> 02:44.350
So why are we still here, huh?

02:44.370 --> 02:45.470
Come, come! Let's go.

<i>All seven personnel</i>

04:09.340 --> 04:11.340
from the Mali operation
two years ago.

04:11.360 --> 04:13.450
- George White, he headed it up?
- Yeah.

04:13.470 --> 04:15.420
But the Section's
been mothballed.

04:15.440 --> 04:16.490
Past eight months or so.

04:16.510 --> 04:18.500
White, MIA, presumed dead.

04:18.519 --> 04:20.510
Presumed?

04:20.529 --> 04:23.460
No one's seen him since his car
was T-boned in West London.

04:23.480 --> 04:25.350
Alexander Said.

04:25.370 --> 04:27.290
Deceased...
that one's pretty conclusive.

04:27.310 --> 04:29.470
Stabbed in the neck
also about eight months back.

04:29.490 --> 04:31.390
Harry Clarke?

04:31.410 --> 04:33.350
Went private sector,

04:33.370 --> 04:36.380
security contractor.
Guess where.

04:36.400 --> 04:38.500
Mali? Right.

04:38.520 --> 04:41.430
Leyla Toumi,
whereabouts unknown.

04:41.450 --> 04:44.310
Is there anyone involved
in the operation that isn't

04:44.330 --> 04:46.520
missing, dead, or back in Mali?

04:49.400 --> 04:51.460
<i>Although the protests
that started</i>

04:51.480 --> 04:56.360
in 2011 were, for the most part,
nonsectarian,

04:56.380 --> 04:59.410
clear sectarian
and ethnic divisions emerged

04:59.430 --> 05:02.390
as a result
of the armed conflict.

05:02.410 --> 05:06.340
Okay, that's it.

05:06.360 --> 05:08.320
Papers due Friday, people.

05:16.380 --> 05:18.350
<i>Uh, Elliot Taylor?</i>

05:18.370 --> 05:19.430
<i>Who's this?</i>

05:19.450 --> 05:21.360
My name is Meaghan Sullivan,

05:21.380 --> 05:22.510
I'm a United States senator.

05:22.530 --> 05:24.430
How did you get this number?

05:24.450 --> 05:26.510
I serve on the
Senate Intelligence Committee

05:26.530 --> 05:28.380
here in D.C.

05:28.400 --> 05:30.470
- Okay.
- <i>I was wondering</i>

05:30.490 --> 05:33.360
if I could talk to you
about Mali.

05:33.380 --> 05:35.330
I only need a few minutes.

05:35.350 --> 05:37.430
I can't talk to you, Senator.

05:37.450 --> 05:40.390
Nothing sensitive, just
a-a bit of background infor...

05:40.410 --> 05:41.470
Terms of my exit.

05:41.490 --> 05:43.360
<i>You must know that.</i>

05:43.380 --> 05:45.320
<i>I can't help.</i>

06:02.460 --> 06:05.320
The second she's back
on her feet, I'm gone.

06:10.340 --> 06:12.320
Will you stay in Mali?

06:12.340 --> 06:15.320
I think that bridge
may be burned, Leyla.

06:15.340 --> 06:18.300
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

06:18.320 --> 06:21.290
What about you?

06:21.310 --> 06:23.500
Honestly, I haven't got a
fucking clue what I'm gonna do.

06:28.350 --> 06:29.440
Hmm.

06:29.460 --> 06:32.440
Well, first time for everything.

06:54.500 --> 06:56.380
Fuck, we have to move.

06:56.400 --> 06:57.410
Sorry, Aicha.

06:57.430 --> 06:58.470
- What?
- Got to go.

07:20.320 --> 07:22.380
This way.

07:34.320 --> 07:35.420
All right.

07:39.330 --> 07:40.380
Clear.

07:40.400 --> 07:43.350
They were here.

08:00.310 --> 08:01.400
Ah...

08:04.340 --> 08:07.510
They could be anywhere.

08:07.530 --> 08:09.390
Shit.

08:09.410 --> 08:11.470
Ah, w-we missed them.

08:11.490 --> 08:13.440
We missed them.

08:16.490 --> 08:18.430
Put out a general call.

08:18.450 --> 08:21.420
Police, army,
roadblocks out of the city,

08:21.440 --> 08:23.360
airports... I want them found!

08:23.380 --> 08:25.370
We've already gone
over this, Joseph.

08:25.390 --> 08:28.400
If word gets out
that Aicha's alive,

08:28.420 --> 08:30.360
people start asking questions.

08:30.380 --> 08:31.360
And where does that leave us?

08:31.380 --> 08:32.419
"Us"?

08:33.440 --> 08:35.490
"Us"?!

08:36.500 --> 08:39.350
There is no "us," Nathan.

08:39.370 --> 08:41.309
There is you over here.

08:41.330 --> 08:42.510
And me...

08:42.530 --> 08:44.480
over here.

08:47.300 --> 08:49.310
You are an advisor.

08:49.330 --> 08:51.450
- I tolerate you.
- Okay.

08:53.420 --> 08:55.370
As your advisor...

08:55.390 --> 08:57.470
can I ask you something?

08:57.490 --> 09:01.410
Do you have a watch
on the interpreter's house?

09:04.430 --> 09:07.370
If I know Aicha,
she will not leave this city

09:07.390 --> 09:09.500
without her brother
and her sister.

09:24.360 --> 09:26.450
I've brought you some food.

09:26.470 --> 09:28.490
Thank you.

09:28.510 --> 09:30.460
Hey, Seydou.

09:40.460 --> 09:43.460
- How is he?
- The same.

09:44.530 --> 09:48.310
Are we going to have
to move out of this house?

09:48.330 --> 09:50.430
Who's going to pay the bills?

09:52.360 --> 09:53.510
You're gonna have to find work.

09:55.440 --> 09:57.380
You can stay with me...

09:57.400 --> 09:59.390
for a while.

09:59.410 --> 10:00.530
And then?

10:09.380 --> 10:10.500
- Here.
- Here?

10:10.520 --> 10:12.370
Here.

10:21.320 --> 10:24.330
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

10:24.350 --> 10:25.420
Thanks.

10:29.460 --> 10:32.400
You came.

10:32.420 --> 10:33.500
Of course.

10:33.520 --> 10:37.330
Did you think we'd leave you?

10:38.350 --> 10:40.340
You did before.

10:41.340 --> 10:42.470
Yeah.

10:44.410 --> 10:46.510
I'm so sorry.

10:50.450 --> 10:52.480
You're here.

10:54.530 --> 10:57.280
You saved my life.

10:57.300 --> 10:59.460
Thank you.

11:02.400 --> 11:04.440
You want to tell us
what happened?

11:08.490 --> 11:11.390
I found out our government
is selling arms to Al Moctar.

11:11.410 --> 11:13.400
Jesus.

11:13.420 --> 11:15.480
I took what I knew
to a friend of mine...

11:15.500 --> 11:19.530
Bintou Cissé... she worked for
the anti-corruption task force.

11:21.350 --> 11:23.400
They were waiting for us.

11:25.420 --> 11:27.460
They killed her
and now they are after me.

11:31.430 --> 11:33.490
Hey, we can get you out of here.

11:33.510 --> 11:36.330
And that's it.

11:36.350 --> 11:39.310
It's not your business,
right, Harry?

11:39.330 --> 11:40.510
- No, it's not.
- But still you help me?

11:43.370 --> 11:45.380
Might have something
to do with me.

11:47.420 --> 11:49.320
Look, we'll get you
out of Bamako...

11:49.340 --> 11:50.410
My brother and sister.

11:50.430 --> 11:52.370
I will not leave without them.

11:52.390 --> 11:54.450
If I leave them here alone,
they'll end up on the street.

11:54.470 --> 11:57.430
I won't do that.

11:59.320 --> 12:01.350
Leyla.

12:03.480 --> 12:05.510
Excuse me.

12:10.520 --> 12:13.440
We've done what we said we'd do.

12:13.460 --> 12:15.410
You're not serious.

12:15.430 --> 12:17.370
- She's safe.
- For now.

12:17.390 --> 12:19.320
So you don't think they'll be
watching those kids?

12:19.340 --> 12:21.440
- It's suicide.
- Christ.

12:21.460 --> 12:24.310
You're actually fucking serious.

12:25.450 --> 12:27.500
I'm not gonna leave her, Harry.

12:27.520 --> 12:31.370
You've done what you said
you'd do... well done.

13:08.320 --> 13:10.420
"We are calling your people.
Let's hope they pay."

13:10.440 --> 13:12.370
They'll pay.

13:19.420 --> 13:23.410
"If not,
you're worth less than my animals."

13:28.500 --> 13:30.530
"You think I'm a monster."

13:32.530 --> 13:34.320
"A terrorist."

13:36.360 --> 13:37.340
"Come here."

13:47.520 --> 13:49.430
"They don't give milk."

13:50.380 --> 13:51.450
"Not anymore."

13:52.490 --> 13:54.360
"There's no water."

13:55.420 --> 13:56.510
"No grass."

14:01.330 --> 14:02.520
"And what does
the state of Mali do?"

14:28.460 --> 14:31.410
You really think you can do that
with the bullet and the AK?

15:16.380 --> 15:17.410
"Let me ask you."

15:18.480 --> 15:20.440
"What would you do?"

15:28.510 --> 15:30.410
Been enjoying the sights?

15:31.430 --> 15:32.500
Been taking a leak.

15:36.440 --> 15:41.350
There's a truck, over that
ridge, with the keys in it.

15:41.370 --> 15:44.380
- Bad idea.
- We travel 90 minutes from the outpost,

15:44.400 --> 15:47.330
northeast.
I'm telling you, we could do it.

15:47.350 --> 15:51.500
Even if we could get
to the truck without being shot,

15:51.520 --> 15:54.410
you think we can outrun them
across a hundred miles

15:54.430 --> 15:56.360
of empty desert?

15:57.440 --> 16:00.340
The money doesn't come through?

16:00.360 --> 16:02.430
Maybe we don't have a choice.

16:02.450 --> 16:04.480
It'll come through.

16:10.530 --> 16:13.310
We need to expedite the payment.

16:13.330 --> 16:15.430
We understand the seriousness
of the situation.

16:15.450 --> 16:18.430
So let's pay the money
and get them home.

16:18.450 --> 16:22.400
25 million's hardly back-of-
the-sofa money, though, is it?

16:22.420 --> 16:25.420
Hold on a minute.
Am I missing something?

16:25.440 --> 16:28.390
Are we not gonna pay?

16:28.410 --> 16:32.390
Pay, and we place a price tag
on every agent in the field.

16:32.410 --> 16:35.380
Might as well bankroll
future attacks on home soil.

16:35.400 --> 16:36.440
"Home soil."

16:36.460 --> 16:38.390
Baker Street, 2009.

16:38.410 --> 16:40.370
Liverpool, 2013.

16:40.390 --> 16:43.440
Philadelphia, 2014. Are you
familiar with George White?

16:43.460 --> 16:45.440
- I've read his file.
- Then you know his record

16:45.460 --> 16:48.330
of averted attacks. How many
lives do you think he's saved?

16:48.350 --> 16:50.280
600, 700?

16:50.300 --> 16:52.280
Marcus, you want to be the one

16:52.300 --> 16:55.380
who left George White
in the desert over policy?

17:02.490 --> 17:05.450
"Don't you have machines
to do this for you in America?"

17:05.470 --> 17:07.480
Herding goats?

17:07.500 --> 17:11.510
You have a funny idea
about America, my man.

17:11.530 --> 17:15.349
Where did you learn
how to fight?

17:27.470 --> 17:29.290
"When he was gone,
we were not welcome there."

17:29.310 --> 17:31.280
When did you come back?

17:44.460 --> 17:47.490
"You ask a lot of questions
for a mining company man."

17:51.310 --> 17:53.440
I'm just a man interested
in the world around me.

18:18.310 --> 18:20.380
"Seems your people
don't want you back.

18:20.400 --> 18:23.350
They haven't paid."

18:23.370 --> 18:26.340
"First light tomorrow morning,
I'll pick two from your group."

18:29.360 --> 18:30.390
"One buries the other."

18:30.410 --> 18:31.420
Come on. Come on, man.

18:31.440 --> 18:33.420
These-these things take time.

18:33.440 --> 18:35.350
Look, I-I can call them.

18:36.490 --> 18:38.450
Just let me call them!

19:04.330 --> 19:07.400
<i>Anything around front?</i>

19:07.420 --> 19:09.320
Nothing yet, sir.

19:09.340 --> 19:10.400
<i>What about the back?</i>

19:10.420 --> 19:12.300
I will tell you
when there is something.

19:12.320 --> 19:13.400
Keep watching.

19:59.470 --> 20:02.330
They're not coming.

20:06.500 --> 20:08.400
Excuse me,

20:08.420 --> 20:11.490
I got to take this.

20:11.510 --> 20:13.450
Morning, sir.

20:13.470 --> 20:15.410
Night.

20:15.430 --> 20:16.490
What's the problem?

20:16.510 --> 20:18.450
<i>Sir?</i>

20:18.470 --> 20:21.420
You went down there to get
the troop deal signed.

20:21.440 --> 20:23.450
Troop deal's not been signed,

20:23.470 --> 20:27.490
therefore I'm assuming
there's a problem.

20:27.510 --> 20:30.370
Would I be incorrect?

20:30.390 --> 20:32.330
There's no problem, sir.

20:32.350 --> 20:34.340
Wheels just turning a little
slowly, that's all.

20:34.360 --> 20:35.490
<i>Well, make them turn faster.</i>

20:35.510 --> 20:40.370
We lost a not-insignificant
amount of money

20:40.390 --> 20:44.500
when the Tehran operation
went belly-up, Nathan.

20:44.520 --> 20:46.460
Yes, sir, I understand that.

20:46.480 --> 20:48.450
<i>And I cannot afford</i>

20:48.470 --> 20:50.460
another failure.

20:50.480 --> 20:53.380
If this doesn't go through,

20:53.400 --> 20:56.460
lot of things are gonna happen
to you and me.

20:56.480 --> 20:58.300
None of them good.

21:13.430 --> 21:15.420
I got to move things along.

21:15.440 --> 21:18.390
You stay here,
keep an eye on him.

21:18.410 --> 21:21.450
Make sure he doesn't fuck
this up for all of us, okay?

21:34.340 --> 21:37.310
Couldn't stay away, could you?

21:37.330 --> 21:39.390
I get it, I'm addictive.

21:39.410 --> 21:42.350
Yeah, yeah, this is,
uh, all about you.

21:42.370 --> 21:43.390
Went back to Aicha, did you?

21:43.410 --> 21:45.430
- She told me where to find you.
- Hmm.

21:47.400 --> 21:50.370
What have we got?

21:52.370 --> 21:54.380
The kids are over there.

21:54.400 --> 21:57.420
Down the street,
three guys in a car.

22:04.480 --> 22:06.390
Hey, kids.

22:15.300 --> 22:17.490
We contact the neighbor, she can
get a message to the kids.

22:17.510 --> 22:20.300
Get them to meet us somewhere
we can shake security.

22:21.400 --> 22:23.360
We will take the kids

22:23.380 --> 22:26.360
and flush the interpreter
out into the open.

22:26.380 --> 22:27.440
I don't think
that's a good idea.

22:29.330 --> 22:31.320
I am sick of being
ordered around.

22:31.340 --> 22:33.320
I am sick of waiting!

22:34.420 --> 22:37.400
Boubacar, change of plan.

23:02.420 --> 23:04.370
Let me go! Get off me!

23:07.440 --> 23:09.340
Come on, no! No, no!

23:09.360 --> 23:11.280
No-no-no-no!

23:35.520 --> 23:38.380
Where are they?

23:38.400 --> 23:40.310
What happened?

23:47.350 --> 23:48.370
I'm sorry.

23:56.480 --> 23:58.460
- They won't hurt them.
- They're trying to force you

23:58.480 --> 24:00.410
out into the open, okay?

24:00.430 --> 24:02.420
Look, most likely, they've
already contacted you by now.

24:02.440 --> 24:05.340
You should check your e-mails.

24:27.330 --> 24:29.310
I feel sick.

24:32.410 --> 24:34.430
Listen, we'll fix this.

24:34.450 --> 24:36.470
How will we fix it?

24:55.510 --> 24:58.470
- Where are you going?
- To hand myself in.

24:58.490 --> 25:01.310
No, no, no.
Aicha, that is not a good idea.

25:01.330 --> 25:03.290
- Seydou... he's not well, he needs me.
- You hand yourself in

25:03.310 --> 25:05.320
to these people...
think what they've already done.

25:05.340 --> 25:07.310
- Think what they're gonna do to you.
- Yeah, they'll kill you.

25:07.330 --> 25:08.440
Who's gonna look after
Sonata and Seydou then?

25:08.460 --> 25:10.390
You're no good to anyone dead.

25:10.410 --> 25:12.330
Sissoko, okay?

25:12.350 --> 25:15.500
The woman Bintou worked for...
Aminata Sissoko.

25:15.520 --> 25:18.470
Okay? Why-why don't we go
to her? Maybe she can help.

25:18.490 --> 25:20.450
How can we trust her?

25:20.470 --> 25:24.330
I don't know, but it's
got to be worth a try.

25:24.350 --> 25:25.490
Come on, Aicha.

25:25.510 --> 25:28.350
We are not gonna give up,
I promise.

25:28.370 --> 25:31.330
I promise you that.

25:33.450 --> 25:34.460
Hey, Nathan.

25:41.420 --> 25:44.480
From Libya with love.

26:25.390 --> 26:28.510
<i>That's why he gets
paid the big bucks, right here.</i>

26:28.530 --> 26:33.310
<i>Another strike and... Brown!</i>

26:34.510 --> 26:37.300
<i>In the air at left field,</i>

26:37.320 --> 26:40.340
<i>and that was hit well
and that's got a chance.</i>

26:40.360 --> 26:42.330
<i>And this one's gone!</i>

26:53.310 --> 26:54.400
Aminata Sissoko?

26:55.440 --> 26:57.340
I need you to see this.

26:57.360 --> 26:59.410
You might want to take a look
at what's on it.

26:59.430 --> 27:02.350
Show me.

27:02.370 --> 27:04.500
She's alive. Check the date.

27:04.520 --> 27:07.500
She's clean.

27:07.520 --> 27:10.390
<i>Joseph Damba's selling arms</i>

27:10.410 --> 27:12.340
<i>to Issouf Al Moctar.</i>

27:12.360 --> 27:16.310
- That's some allegation.
- Yeah, there's evidence.

27:16.330 --> 27:18.290
Aicha Konaté gave it
to Bintou Cissé.

27:18.310 --> 27:19.420
That's why they were ambushed.

27:19.440 --> 27:23.470
They were the target,
not the Americans.

27:23.490 --> 27:26.440
- Where is this evidence?
- Aicha has copies.

27:26.460 --> 27:29.460
- Text messages, a tape.
- She has Damba on tape?

27:29.480 --> 27:31.460
She was translating
in his department.

27:31.480 --> 27:33.420
He didn't know
the tapes were running.

27:34.450 --> 27:36.430
Why should I believe you?

27:36.450 --> 27:38.470
Somebody abducted Aicha's
little brother and sister

27:38.490 --> 27:40.310
from her home.

27:40.330 --> 27:41.480
They'll be witnesses.

27:41.500 --> 27:43.500
You find those kids,
we give you the evidence,

27:43.520 --> 27:46.390
and you decide for yourself.

27:46.410 --> 27:48.310
My number's in that phone.

27:48.330 --> 27:50.380
We don't find them within
the hour, they're dead.

28:03.460 --> 28:05.410
Hey.

28:13.420 --> 28:15.360
Darryl, could you
take a look at this?

28:15.380 --> 28:16.460
Sure.

28:18.490 --> 28:22.360
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I.D.'s been revoked.

28:22.380 --> 28:24.360
- You're shitting me.
- Morning, Williams.

28:24.380 --> 28:26.440
David?

28:26.460 --> 28:28.470
Apparently I've been revoked?

28:28.490 --> 28:31.490
- Sorry, Meaghan.
- You knew about this?

28:31.510 --> 28:33.440
It's out of my hands.

28:37.300 --> 28:39.300
Todd.

28:39.320 --> 28:41.370
I'm off the committee,
just like that?

28:41.390 --> 28:44.490
No consultation,
no three strikes?

28:44.510 --> 28:47.490
I consulted you, Meaghan.
You didn't hear me.

28:47.510 --> 28:50.370
And that's it?

28:50.390 --> 28:52.500
Look, do your time in the box

28:52.520 --> 28:54.480
and I'll bring you
back in from the cold.

28:54.500 --> 28:58.480
Precarious times, Meaghan.
Whomever we're backing,

28:58.500 --> 29:00.320
we need alignment.

29:00.340 --> 29:02.420
We're aligned, Todd.

29:02.440 --> 29:04.520
So show me.

29:06.350 --> 29:08.520
Just wind your neck in a little.

29:09.510 --> 29:12.330
Can you do that?

29:16.330 --> 29:18.360
Don't pull the plug
on the fund-raiser.

29:20.360 --> 29:21.490
Don't make me beg either.

29:21.510 --> 29:23.420
You know it brings me out
in hives.

29:23.440 --> 29:26.420
I always knew
you were a survivor.

30:50.410 --> 30:52.410
Since when do you smoke?

30:54.310 --> 30:55.490
I don't.

30:55.510 --> 30:58.300
Filthy habit.

30:59.500 --> 31:01.490
Todd Wilson's looking for you.

31:05.350 --> 31:08.280
You know the great big bitch
of a catch-22

31:08.300 --> 31:10.470
about this town, Jessica?

31:10.490 --> 31:13.440
- We're doing this now?
- The more you're a part of it,

31:13.460 --> 31:17.300
the less you can actually do.

31:17.320 --> 31:19.520
Inside. Now.

31:28.430 --> 31:30.340
I thought you bailed.

31:30.360 --> 31:32.320
Now, would I do that
to you, Todd?

31:32.340 --> 31:34.410
It's a good crowd.

31:34.430 --> 31:37.380
Right. Showtime.

31:38.400 --> 31:40.430
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

31:40.450 --> 31:43.290
<i>I give you someone who needs
no introduction,</i>

31:43.310 --> 31:44.450
except to say that

31:44.470 --> 31:48.340
she's never quit fighting
for what she believes in.

31:48.360 --> 31:50.450
For American values,

31:50.470 --> 31:53.450
for the American people.

31:53.470 --> 31:56.530
Senator Meaghan Sullivan.

32:07.420 --> 32:10.360
Thank you.

32:10.380 --> 32:12.510
Thank you. Thank you, Todd.

32:16.400 --> 32:19.450
And thank you all for being here
tonight for your support.

32:22.330 --> 32:24.360
And for your love.

32:28.410 --> 32:30.500
The next election will,
in so many ways,

32:30.520 --> 32:34.500
decide what kind of country
we leave for our children.

32:34.520 --> 32:37.420
The nation we enjoy today

32:37.440 --> 32:40.350
is the result of the hard work

32:40.370 --> 32:43.340
and the sacrifice
and the choices

32:43.360 --> 32:47.400
of the men and women who stood
before where we stand now.

32:50.490 --> 32:53.500
And so, we must ask oursel...

33:00.320 --> 33:02.470
We must ask ours...

33:23.300 --> 33:25.480
I was elected

33:25.500 --> 33:31.280
class president
when I was 12 years old.

33:31.300 --> 33:33.450
I've been running for office
ever since.

33:35.420 --> 33:37.430
I've been lucky enough
to serve in the Senate

33:37.450 --> 33:40.320
for the great state of Ohio.

33:40.340 --> 33:44.280
In the U.S. Senate.

33:44.300 --> 33:46.470
On more...
councils and committees

33:46.490 --> 33:49.390
than I can remember.

33:49.410 --> 33:52.400
Hell, I can't even remember
what some of them were called

33:52.420 --> 33:55.340
or what they were for...

33:55.360 --> 33:57.360
or what they achieved.

33:57.380 --> 33:59.480
What the fuck is going on?

33:59.500 --> 34:01.320
And for what?

34:01.340 --> 34:03.390
I mean, what have I got
to show for it?

34:05.430 --> 34:08.320
My name on a few bills.

34:10.350 --> 34:13.280
And, sure, I made my mom proud.

34:13.300 --> 34:15.320
My dad, too.

34:15.340 --> 34:18.330
Well, until I came out.

34:18.350 --> 34:21.320
As a Republican, I mean.

34:27.480 --> 34:30.380
"Suck it up, sister."

34:32.389 --> 34:34.409
"Think of your career."

34:36.389 --> 34:39.480
Because, let's face it, that's
all I've ever really done.

34:39.500 --> 34:42.420
That's why I get to stand
before you today

34:42.440 --> 34:44.340
a fourth-term senator.

34:44.360 --> 34:47.530
Truth is, you do that
by not achieving anything.

34:50.510 --> 34:53.429
You do that by toeing the line.

34:55.520 --> 34:59.500
All you ever really learn
to do is win.

34:59.520 --> 35:01.360
Right, Todd?

35:06.470 --> 35:09.340
I am so tired...

35:09.360 --> 35:12.410
of playing this endless game,

35:12.430 --> 35:16.420
where nothing ever changes.

35:16.440 --> 35:19.450
The same people win.

35:19.470 --> 35:21.460
The same people lose.

35:21.480 --> 35:24.350
And we just trot out
the same old platitudes

35:24.370 --> 35:26.400
about how we're going
to change Washington,

35:26.420 --> 35:29.350
and all the time we know
we're paying lip service

35:29.370 --> 35:32.430
to the fact that we're
supposed to be a democracy.

35:34.450 --> 35:36.390
We know that.

35:42.320 --> 35:46.300
And as you may have gathered
from my, uh,

35:46.320 --> 35:48.350
off-book ramblings here,

35:48.370 --> 35:52.440
I won't be standing
for reelection.

35:56.510 --> 35:58.530
I'm sorry.

36:02.390 --> 36:04.340
What the fuck was that about?

36:04.360 --> 36:06.470
I've got six months
between now and the election.

36:06.490 --> 36:09.360
I can do what the fuck I want,
they can't touch me.

36:09.380 --> 36:12.510
That, Jessica, was a declaration
of independence.

37:13.360 --> 37:16.360
It's Ansar Dine,
al-Qaeda affiliate.

37:21.340 --> 37:23.400
What's he saying?

37:23.420 --> 37:25.370
He knows we're here.

37:25.390 --> 37:28.300
He says we were found
on his territory,

37:28.320 --> 37:29.400
that we belong to him.

37:29.420 --> 37:30.460
Hey!

37:53.400 --> 37:56.350
- Aicha, what's going on?
- I don't know, I can't hear.

38:09.470 --> 38:12.320
What did he just say to him?

38:32.520 --> 38:35.300
Hello?

38:49.480 --> 38:52.310
It's untouched.

39:03.370 --> 39:04.490
Hello?

39:04.510 --> 39:06.440
I know you are in there. Please.

39:06.460 --> 39:08.470
I need you to help me.

39:10.380 --> 39:12.400
Hel...

39:15.410 --> 39:17.480
- My name is Aminata Sissoko.
- I know who you are.

39:17.500 --> 39:19.400
Can I come in?

39:23.420 --> 39:25.320
You saw something, didn't you?

39:25.340 --> 39:26.440
- Huh?
- Seydou and Sonata.

39:26.460 --> 39:29.340
You know them, don't you?

39:29.360 --> 39:31.440
Did someone take them away, huh?

39:31.460 --> 39:33.410
Did you see who did it?

39:34.420 --> 39:36.370
I get it.

39:36.390 --> 39:38.330
You're scared.

39:38.350 --> 39:41.400
I get scared, too. Every day.

39:41.420 --> 39:45.280
But right now
I need you to help me.

39:45.300 --> 39:49.350
Right now I need you
to help me find those children.

39:49.370 --> 39:52.480
Did you see who took them?

39:56.520 --> 39:59.450
Hey, pull up
Damba's security detail.

40:03.350 --> 40:04.450
Look.

40:04.470 --> 40:07.350
Do you recognize
any of these men?

40:17.510 --> 40:20.390
Boubacar.

40:25.390 --> 40:27.430
How's Fatima?

40:29.480 --> 40:31.370
What's that?

40:31.390 --> 40:33.320
Mouth a little dry there, huh?

40:36.400 --> 40:38.440
Where are those children?

40:38.460 --> 40:41.430
I don't know
what you're talking about.

40:41.450 --> 40:43.320
Ooh!

40:43.340 --> 40:44.430
You see, the mistake
you are making

40:44.450 --> 40:47.390
is to fear Damba more
than you fear me.

40:47.410 --> 40:50.310
Now, I'm going
to ask you one more time.

41:09.360 --> 41:11.430
<i>It's Aminata Sissoko.</i>

41:11.450 --> 41:14.300
- Do you have them?
- No, not yet.

41:14.320 --> 41:16.310
- Do you know where they are?
- <i>Yes.</i>

41:16.330 --> 41:17.510
I'm heading there now.

41:17.530 --> 41:19.490
Oh, please.

41:19.510 --> 41:21.530
Thank you. Thank you.

41:36.330 --> 41:37.430
<i>She knows.</i>

41:37.450 --> 41:39.310
Who knows what?

41:39.330 --> 41:40.480
<i>Sissoko.</i>

41:40.500 --> 41:43.430
She got to one of my guards.
He flipped.

41:47.380 --> 41:49.400
Flipped about what, Joseph?

41:49.420 --> 41:51.480
<i>About me taking the children.</i>

41:52.490 --> 41:54.400
<i>Let me tell you, Nathan.</i>

41:54.420 --> 41:57.490
If I go down, you go down
with me, you understand?

41:57.510 --> 42:00.390
Trust me.

42:00.410 --> 42:02.440
I'm taking care of it.

42:11.460 --> 42:13.390
<i>You've said that before,
and nothing happens!</i>

42:13.410 --> 42:15.400
<i>Do not fuck this up, Nathan!</i>

42:15.420 --> 42:17.450
Do not fu...

42:34.390 --> 42:36.530
Come on.

42:56.350 --> 42:58.340
Understood.
It's a car bomb.

43:55.400 --> 43:58.400
Were you serious
about wanting out?

43:58.420 --> 44:00.430
You thinking about it, too?

44:00.450 --> 44:02.460
Well, this isn't
some country club, Amanda.

44:02.480 --> 44:05.350
I don't get to just leave.

44:05.370 --> 44:08.420
But if we get this deal
over the line,

44:08.440 --> 44:11.400
maybe Kingsley will let you go.

44:11.420 --> 44:13.430
You think?

44:13.450 --> 44:15.480
I can put in a word.

44:19.370 --> 44:21.490
Please.

44:25.390 --> 44:27.410
Our condolences, Mr. President.

44:28.450 --> 44:29.520
Thank you.

44:30.310 --> 44:31.440
Thank you very much

44:31.460 --> 44:33.320
for seeing us, Mr. President.

44:33.340 --> 44:36.410
We know what a difficult time
this is for you.

44:36.430 --> 44:38.320
America,

44:38.340 --> 44:41.510
with its eyes and ears
everywhere.

44:43.430 --> 44:45.390
We're happy to
share what we have.

44:45.410 --> 44:48.460
And what is that?

44:48.480 --> 44:52.440
Our preliminary intel points
to Al Moctar.

44:52.460 --> 44:55.450
We've picked up
significant chatter.

44:55.470 --> 44:59.370
And as you know all too well,
it fits his pattern.

44:59.390 --> 45:01.400
From what we can gather, sir,

45:01.420 --> 45:05.330
this is the beginning
of a sustained campaign.

45:06.500 --> 45:10.310
My own generals are nervous.

45:10.330 --> 45:13.410
They tell me
we need to be decisive.

45:13.430 --> 45:16.410
And yet they can't defeat
this... threat.

45:16.430 --> 45:18.480
At least not alone.

45:25.430 --> 45:29.340
From the president's lips,
he's signing the deal tomorrow.

45:29.360 --> 45:31.410
Well, that's a result, Nathan.

45:31.430 --> 45:34.340
If it's okay with you, we're
gonna... we're gonna head back.

45:34.360 --> 45:38.480
I think 20,000 U.S. troops ought
to be an adequate replacement.

45:38.500 --> 45:41.280
We'll take that compliment.

45:41.300 --> 45:43.490
<i>When can we expect
the procurement order</i>

45:43.510 --> 45:47.300
to be authorized
by the White House?

45:47.320 --> 45:49.330
As soon as the deal is signed.

45:49.350 --> 45:51.510
And, uh,
where are we on the number?

45:51.530 --> 45:53.460
<i>Well, if we can transition</i>

45:53.480 --> 45:57.290
the four temporary bases
into permanent ones,

45:57.310 --> 45:58.490
we're looking at four and a half
billion dollars

45:58.510 --> 46:00.450
over the next five years.

46:00.470 --> 46:02.380
<i>Good.</i>

46:02.400 --> 46:04.390
You hear the news
about Sullivan?

46:04.410 --> 46:07.280
<i>Surprised everyone
by announcing</i>

46:07.300 --> 46:09.300
<i>she's not standing
for reelection.</i>

46:09.320 --> 46:11.500
That sounds like congratulations
all around.

46:11.520 --> 46:14.370
Maybe in the long run, but...

46:14.390 --> 46:16.510
harder to control her now.

46:16.530 --> 46:19.460
I like all my alligators

46:19.480 --> 46:21.360
<i>in the swamp.</i>

46:21.380 --> 46:23.340
Well, I find 'em
much easier to target

46:23.360 --> 46:25.330
when they're laying
on the bank, sir.

46:25.350 --> 46:27.400
I think that's something
you might need

46:27.420 --> 46:29.490
to make a priority
on your return.

46:29.510 --> 46:35.310
Most expensive leather
in the world... alligator.

46:35.330 --> 46:36.440
<i>Oh, and, Nathan?</i>

46:36.460 --> 46:38.340
Yes, sir.

46:38.360 --> 46:40.300
<i>Jones stays out there.</i>

46:40.320 --> 46:43.370
I want her
to oversee the next phase.

46:46.340 --> 46:48.360
Yes, sir.

47:20.300 --> 47:21.360
What's going on?

47:21.380 --> 47:22.480
Camp's under attack.
Ansar Dine.

47:22.500 --> 47:24.450
They've come for us.

47:24.470 --> 47:26.350
Now's our chance.

47:26.370 --> 47:27.420
- To do what?
- Truck over the ridge

47:27.440 --> 47:29.330
to the south. Keys in it.

47:31.350 --> 47:33.360
Isaac! Isaac!

47:33.380 --> 47:35.510
Isaac!

49:39.370 --> 49:41.450
Keys. Fuck.

50:10.340 --> 50:12.440
They've stopped firing.

50:12.460 --> 50:14.340
Come on.

50:16.460 --> 50:18.380
- Got 'em.
- Come on.

50:20.460 --> 50:22.480
Fuck.

50:28.420 --> 50:30.320
In!

50:30.340 --> 50:32.430
In! In!

50:44.440 --> 50:45.490
Shit!

51:39.510 --> 51:41.490
Huh?!

51:56.520 --> 51:58.410
No!
