WEBVTT

00:01.289 --> 00:02.689
What did you do?

00:03.539 --> 00:04.324
What did you do?!

00:04.392 --> 00:06.293
- We need Dawn and Melanda in here right now.
- Hey.

00:06.327 --> 00:08.662
- Nurse!
- Alex. You okay?

00:09.614 --> 00:10.664
Who are you?

00:10.698 --> 00:13.729
It's me. Alex, it's-it's Charlie.

00:13.779 --> 00:15.663
How did I... where am I?

00:15.713 --> 00:16.570
You're in the hospital, Alex.

00:16.604 --> 00:17.804
You're at Hope Zion.

00:17.872 --> 00:20.139
You were hurt, Alex. It's okay.

00:20.174 --> 00:21.708
- I don't remember.
- Okay.

00:21.742 --> 00:23.743
Okay. You just need some rest, all right?

00:23.778 --> 00:25.211
No, no, no. I-I-I don't know how I got here.

00:25.245 --> 00:27.146
- Alex, lie down.
- Alex, listen-listen to me.

00:27.181 --> 00:30.149
That's the anesthetic
wearing off. Just relax, okay?

00:30.184 --> 00:32.051
I don't...

00:32.086 --> 00:35.288
I don't remember...
I don't remember...

00:44.292 --> 00:45.734
Hey, Alex.

00:46.381 --> 00:48.766
Brought you some breakfast.

00:52.697 --> 00:53.706
Not hungry?

00:54.086 --> 00:56.311
No.

00:58.777 --> 01:01.779
So, I hear that you're having
some recall problems.

01:06.547 --> 01:08.029
You don't know who I am, do you?

01:08.172 --> 01:10.021
No, I d... I don't.

01:10.833 --> 01:13.891
Well, I'm Gavin. I'm a staff psychiatrist.

01:13.959 --> 01:16.360
And we've known each other for a while.

01:18.631 --> 01:21.599
We can do this assessment later,
if you want.

01:21.634 --> 01:23.745
You know what? Let's...

01:24.176 --> 01:25.535
let's just do this.

01:26.203 --> 01:28.740
All right, Alex, try telling me
something that you do know.

01:29.189 --> 01:31.423
My chest hurts.

01:31.876 --> 01:35.112
And th... I know that this is a hospital

01:35.147 --> 01:39.116
and I supposedly work here.

01:39.425 --> 01:41.774
And there's this, uh...

01:42.389 --> 01:45.656
this guy that keeps coming
to see me named Charlie.

01:45.821 --> 01:48.569
Well, we were all pretty scared
when you got stabbed, but

01:48.795 --> 01:50.127
him especially.

01:50.487 --> 01:51.561
Why him especially?

01:51.920 --> 01:53.964
The you two were engaged.

01:56.144 --> 02:00.188
And, uh, I'm not really sure
if you still are,

02:00.284 --> 02:04.146
and I don't even know
if you know that, either.

02:04.273 --> 02:06.606
Oh. Okay.

02:07.253 --> 02:08.199
Okay.

02:08.545 --> 02:12.095
Look, you seem to have
no trouble forming new memories,

02:12.151 --> 02:13.916
and that's a good sign.

02:13.950 --> 02:17.787
Postoperative retrograde amnesia
is common and temporary.

02:18.120 --> 02:19.589
I hope so.

02:24.105 --> 02:25.527
It's strange.

02:27.211 --> 02:31.033
I know exactly
what postoperative retrograde amnesia is.

02:33.112 --> 02:36.349
But I have no memory of where I met you.

02:36.758 --> 02:38.307
It was in the doctor's lounge.

02:38.747 --> 02:40.642
It was my first shift.

02:41.396 --> 02:42.277
You were nice.

02:42.881 --> 02:43.745
Okay.

02:46.443 --> 02:47.683
Well, let's wait till he comes out.

02:47.717 --> 02:49.651
- We'll see, but...
- She just needs time.

02:49.686 --> 02:52.120
Well, is there anything
we can do to help, to...

02:53.247 --> 02:54.878
Move her memory forward?

02:54.928 --> 02:55.957
We can't rush this, Charlie.

02:56.237 --> 02:57.892
Okay, well, we can't coddle her.

02:57.927 --> 02:59.527
She's at high risk for thrombosis

02:59.561 --> 03:01.696
where we harvested that vein,
so she needs to get up

03:01.731 --> 03:03.631
and she needs to walk today.

03:03.665 --> 03:07.068
Oh, mass casualties en route.
I need to get to the E.R.

03:10.737 --> 03:12.306
Charlie, she's fine.

03:20.032 --> 03:21.915
Hey, Jackson, do me a favor.
Keep an eye on Alex.

03:21.950 --> 03:25.720
You want me to keep Dr. Goran
out of her room, it'll cost you.

03:48.173 --> 03:50.029
Doing okay in here?

03:52.019 --> 03:55.315
I'm having my first period
since I had the miscarriage.

03:55.868 --> 03:58.117
I have zero control over my emotional state.

03:58.185 --> 03:59.852
That can happen.

03:59.990 --> 04:02.889
I thought I was over all this.

04:03.966 --> 04:05.658
Then someone cut in front of me
at the coffee shop,

04:05.692 --> 04:08.360
and I've been crying ever since.

04:08.846 --> 04:11.130
The laughter just started.

04:11.832 --> 04:14.200
Well, laugh or cry.

04:14.268 --> 04:16.968
Pick one, and then stop doing both.

04:19.314 --> 04:20.539
Thanks.

04:33.815 --> 04:35.325
How is she?

04:37.206 --> 04:39.570
- Good. She's good.
- Good.

04:39.679 --> 04:41.860
Yep, I mean, she, uh...
she has a little amnesia,

04:41.894 --> 04:44.694
and she, uh, needs to get up and walking.

04:45.969 --> 04:47.465
Then I'll get her home.

04:47.773 --> 04:49.099
Yeah, I mean, it's probably best

04:49.134 --> 04:50.787
- not to rush these things, anyway.
- What?

04:50.874 --> 04:55.355
I said it's probably best not to
rush these things, anyway.

04:56.001 --> 04:58.594
Oh, that's-that's-that's good advice.

04:58.885 --> 05:00.311
I hadn't thought about that before.

05:00.346 --> 05:01.621
Thank you very much, Joel, for that

05:01.671 --> 05:02.946
- very helpful advice.
- Quite welcome.

05:09.657 --> 05:11.532
Explosion at a condo construction site

05:11.582 --> 05:12.720
caused the building to collapse.

05:12.770 --> 05:14.091
Burn units took what they could.

05:14.125 --> 05:16.227
Hope Zion's got the spillover
and the orthopedic trauma.

05:16.261 --> 05:17.794
Yikes. Okay, let's get, uh...

05:17.829 --> 05:19.221
let's get a chest tube in him, Maggie.

05:19.271 --> 05:20.497
- Is this all of them?
- I wish.

05:20.531 --> 05:22.366
We got more coming by ambulance, helicopter,

05:22.433 --> 05:24.100
apparently even a few coming in cop cars.

05:24.504 --> 05:25.661
Oh, wow.

05:26.407 --> 05:27.526
What do we have here?

05:27.576 --> 05:28.505
Guys, stop the cart.

05:28.539 --> 05:29.673
I don't even know
what I'm looking at.

05:29.707 --> 05:31.207
Some genius hit a gas main.

05:31.275 --> 05:32.876
Tank of insulation foam
blew up on these two guys

05:32.910 --> 05:34.096
in the heat of the explosion.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.239
Let's get them to the trauma bay.

05:35.289 --> 05:36.023
So, it's stuck to the skin?

05:36.083 --> 05:38.115
Stuck to the skin, stuck to
the clothes, it's hard to tell.

05:38.165 --> 05:39.515
Does not look like it's coming off easily.

05:39.549 --> 05:40.783
Let's get in there
and see if anything's broken.

05:40.817 --> 05:42.651
Well, they're alive. That's lucky.

05:43.048 --> 05:44.298
This is not lucky.

05:44.348 --> 05:46.890
Please... please help us.

05:50.849 --> 05:52.034
Give me two large-bore I.V.s!

05:52.090 --> 05:53.742
And give them each
a litre bolus of ringer's.

05:53.807 --> 05:55.333
And stat trauma panels.
Cross-match them both.

05:55.420 --> 05:57.328
- Four units of blood.
- Please.

05:57.429 --> 05:59.263
It hurts s-so much.

05:59.298 --> 06:00.531
Can you describe your pain for me?

06:02.067 --> 06:03.634
It hurts when I breathe.

06:03.668 --> 06:05.136
Is it in your throat or in your chest?

06:06.281 --> 06:09.807
My chest, my side... it just really hurts.

06:09.874 --> 06:11.274
And what about you, sir?

06:11.309 --> 06:12.083
I think some...

06:12.157 --> 06:14.177
I think something hit me
in the explosion when we fell.

06:14.212 --> 06:15.679
- Can you feel that?
- What? Yeah.

06:15.714 --> 06:17.507
- Okay. How about that?
- Yeah, yeah, I feel that.

06:17.557 --> 06:19.016
That's actually a good sign.

06:19.050 --> 06:20.618
So, how do you two know each other?

06:20.652 --> 06:22.352
Uh, we-we were working onsite.

06:22.703 --> 06:24.569
I'm an electrician. She's the architect.

06:24.649 --> 06:25.355
I'm Marshall.

06:25.423 --> 06:26.459
Anna.

06:26.555 --> 06:29.259
How did we end up like this?
I'm kind of a little foggy.

06:29.293 --> 06:33.062
We were talking, and the place just blew up.

06:33.097 --> 06:34.731
What's the plan, you guys?!

06:34.798 --> 06:36.299
Anna, listen to me.

06:36.334 --> 06:37.587
We're gonna separate you
as soon as possible.

06:37.642 --> 06:39.603
Fortunately, we have
all the equipment we need

06:39.670 --> 06:40.440
to do that right here.

06:40.520 --> 06:41.755
- You talking about a saw?
- Yes, I am.

06:41.805 --> 06:44.440
Uh, okay, that's one option,
but solvents would be another,

06:44.546 --> 06:46.158
- less violent option.
- Oh, I'll take the less violent option!

06:46.208 --> 06:47.376
Solvents are not gonna dissolve this.

06:47.444 --> 06:49.296
Thank you very much for your
input. I got this one, mate.

06:49.385 --> 06:51.781
Charlie, I got an open fracture on bed two.
I need you right now.

06:52.186 --> 06:53.282
Plenty of patients to go around.

06:53.316 --> 06:55.018
I'm gonna leave you guys
in the all-knowing hands

06:55.085 --> 06:57.400
- of Dr. Joel Goran.
- Thank you so much.

06:57.483 --> 07:00.055
- Charlie. Joel, what's go...
- Dana.

07:00.272 --> 07:01.757
We're gonna need some solvent.

07:01.791 --> 07:03.771
No, I just told Charlie...
it's not gonna work.

07:03.821 --> 07:04.532
All of it.

07:04.588 --> 07:06.695
It's not gonna get
through there, Dana. Trust me.

07:06.796 --> 07:07.896
You want to use the saw.

07:08.122 --> 07:09.508
Yes, I definitely do.

07:09.586 --> 07:10.313
Well, start with the solvent.

07:10.393 --> 07:12.776
If it doesn't work, we can always escalate.

07:17.133 --> 07:18.299
How's your pain?

07:18.596 --> 07:20.475
Not too bad.

07:21.059 --> 07:23.207
Good, 'cause you're gonna get walking today.

07:23.337 --> 07:24.245
Oh. I...

07:24.280 --> 07:26.081
I don't think I could do that.

07:26.314 --> 07:28.909
Well, Alex, patients who aren't
mobile in recovery

07:28.959 --> 07:30.818
don't do well, so I could
either rattle off a list

07:30.886 --> 07:32.587
of postsurgery complications,

07:32.621 --> 07:34.121
or you could suck it up and do as I say.

07:35.691 --> 07:38.025
I thought doctors are supposed to be nice.

07:38.144 --> 07:39.860
You really don't remember me, do you?

07:41.148 --> 07:41.909
Good.

07:42.092 --> 07:43.843
You're gonna get walking today...

07:43.893 --> 07:45.600
at least to the nurses' station.

07:46.158 --> 07:48.569
I don't know where that is, okay?

07:48.603 --> 07:50.771
I-I don't know where anything is.

07:50.806 --> 07:52.773
And everybody keeps talking
to me like I should remember,

07:52.808 --> 07:54.075
but I don't.

07:54.262 --> 07:56.877
Just go out the door and make a right.

07:56.912 --> 07:58.345
You can't miss it.

07:58.446 --> 07:59.814
Okay.

07:59.848 --> 08:00.850
Let me know if you need a nurse

08:00.900 --> 08:02.663
to help you get out of bed, okay?

08:15.096 --> 08:17.331
Dr. Reid, you'll do fine.

08:24.466 --> 08:25.905
Hey. First try?

08:27.660 --> 08:28.607
Pardon me?

08:28.657 --> 08:31.077
They make you walk
up and down this damn hall.

08:31.249 --> 08:33.645
Took me almost 10 tries to make it.

08:34.139 --> 08:35.176
What are you here for?

08:35.226 --> 08:36.236
Heart.

08:36.287 --> 08:37.515
Me too.

08:37.660 --> 08:39.900
Hey, don't let your first time get you down.

08:40.440 --> 08:42.361
If I can do it, you can do it.

08:43.327 --> 08:45.044
Yeah, I'll, uh, remember that.

08:45.112 --> 08:48.039
Now they're taking their
sweet time discharging me!

08:50.026 --> 08:52.164
But I look good, right?

08:52.492 --> 08:54.751
Uh, you do to me.

08:55.144 --> 09:00.005
And, uh, I'm a doctor,
or so they keep telling me.

09:00.039 --> 09:02.808
Hey, then... maybe you can
sign me out of here,

09:02.842 --> 09:04.243
keep it on the down low?

09:06.058 --> 09:07.221
Yeah, I really...

09:07.299 --> 09:09.032
I really can't. I mean,

09:09.242 --> 09:10.982
I-I wouldn't even know
where to find my white coat.

09:11.016 --> 09:13.518
Yeah, yeah. Worth a try.

09:26.531 --> 09:28.299
Hang on! Hang on! Hang on!
I got you. I got you.

09:28.366 --> 09:30.601
Hey, hey, hey.

09:34.372 --> 09:38.209
Up his oxygen for me. Thanks.

09:38.679 --> 09:40.812
Hi, again. It won't be long, promise.

09:40.846 --> 09:42.079
Maggie, can I have a word?

09:42.181 --> 09:42.968
Yeah.

09:43.036 --> 09:45.849
I, uh... I just got imaging back
from a patient you assessed.

09:45.883 --> 09:47.384
Carl Palansky?

09:47.419 --> 09:50.821
Yeah, he had some hip pain,
but he seems okay.

09:50.855 --> 09:53.724
This isn't from the building collapse.

09:54.791 --> 09:57.361
So, better let him know. Have fun.

09:57.429 --> 09:59.362
- I... I'm not sure...
- I got to go. Thanks.

10:07.138 --> 10:10.540
Hey, Dr. Lin. What's the word?

10:10.574 --> 10:11.942
The good news

10:11.976 --> 10:13.343
is that you managed to escape the building

10:13.377 --> 10:16.379
with nothing more than a few cuts

10:16.413 --> 10:18.348
and bruises.

10:18.382 --> 10:20.783
But...

10:20.818 --> 10:24.787
But... but what, Dr. Lin?

10:25.113 --> 10:27.783
Uh... I'm sorry.

10:27.867 --> 10:29.625
I'll be back.

10:29.660 --> 10:32.627
Dr. Lin? Dr. Lin?

10:32.695 --> 10:35.764
Hello?

10:43.539 --> 10:46.175
Maggie, are you okay?

10:46.209 --> 10:47.676
It's nothing.

10:47.710 --> 10:49.544
It doesn't look like nothing.

10:50.985 --> 10:53.314
It's just a fallout, you know?

10:53.349 --> 10:58.052
Like, my hormones are... at war,

10:58.120 --> 10:59.755
and my emotions are caught in the crossfire.

10:59.822 --> 11:01.256
I can't stop crying.

11:01.290 --> 11:02.858
I hate crying.

11:02.892 --> 11:06.694
My ex was the same after her miscarriage.

11:08.481 --> 11:09.463
Do you want a hug?

11:09.498 --> 11:12.733
No. I just... I don't want a hug.

11:13.361 --> 11:15.702
You know, something
that helped us was, um...

11:15.737 --> 11:17.138
we did something together

11:17.172 --> 11:20.441
that, um, helped her purge emotionally.

11:20.475 --> 11:21.511
I don't know if I want to hear

11:21.595 --> 11:23.343
- about your ex-wife's purging, Zach.
- No, no.

11:23.665 --> 11:25.592
Laughter yoga. It's really good.

11:25.642 --> 11:27.430
You'll like it.
You start with fake laughter.

11:27.480 --> 11:28.783
It turns into real laughter,

11:28.817 --> 11:30.584
and it helps suppress
all of your stress hormones.

11:32.697 --> 11:35.523
We'll do it right now, okay? I'll start.

11:42.630 --> 11:44.097
Could you just stop?

11:44.165 --> 11:46.766
Sorry. Sorry.

11:48.903 --> 11:50.703
Just try it.

11:50.738 --> 11:52.306
It's not working.

11:52.340 --> 11:54.474
Solvent needs more time
to break this stuff down.

11:56.614 --> 11:57.476
We have to stop this.

11:57.511 --> 11:58.778
Joel, if you have somewhere else to be,

11:58.846 --> 11:59.913
please go ahead and be there.

11:59.947 --> 12:01.748
W-what, is it not coming off?

12:01.782 --> 12:04.283
Please, tell me we're not stuck like this.

12:04.318 --> 12:06.352
No, no, we just need a little more time.

12:06.386 --> 12:09.221
Listen, listen, i-it's my kid's
birthday today, okay?

12:09.289 --> 12:12.391
And I wasn't even
supposed to be onsite, okay?

12:12.426 --> 12:14.026
Oh, no, someone has to
pick her up from school!

12:14.061 --> 12:15.428
No, it's-it's gonna be okay.

12:15.462 --> 12:16.862
We'll have a nurse call her mother.

12:16.930 --> 12:18.764
No no,
she's not in the picture, okay?

12:18.798 --> 12:20.566
You got to...
you got to try my sister, okay?

12:20.600 --> 12:23.035
And her number... it's in my phone, okay?

12:23.070 --> 12:24.670
And... which is under
all of this, all right?!

12:24.704 --> 12:26.372
All right. All right. Don't
worry. We're gonna find her.

12:26.406 --> 12:27.840
Anna, anyone you want us to call for you?

12:27.874 --> 12:29.508
I was supposed to meet my boyfriend,

12:29.609 --> 12:30.312
but don't call him.

12:30.373 --> 12:32.077
He's... I don't want him
to see me like this.

12:32.111 --> 12:34.012
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure!

12:34.046 --> 12:36.314
Will you stop playing operator
and just get him off of me?!

12:36.349 --> 12:38.049
Just, please... just do what she says, okay?

12:38.084 --> 12:39.150
Okay.

12:41.529 --> 12:44.710
We have to get the saw, okay?

12:51.964 --> 12:52.930
Hi.

12:52.965 --> 12:55.066
Hi.

12:55.134 --> 12:57.335
Just, uh... I had a minute,

12:57.370 --> 13:00.705
and thought I'd come by
to see you'd been for a walk.

13:00.772 --> 13:03.040
Well, I was up, but it didn't go well.

13:03.074 --> 13:05.376
Well, that's okay. There's no rush.

13:06.361 --> 13:07.598
I just want you to get better.

13:07.648 --> 13:09.547
Yeah, me-me too.

13:09.615 --> 13:11.881
So, um...

13:14.019 --> 13:17.187
Anything... coming back to you yet?

13:18.497 --> 13:20.924
No. Not yet.

13:20.958 --> 13:25.795
No, uh, epiphanies, no dreams, no visions?

13:27.332 --> 13:28.499
Sorry.

13:29.615 --> 13:32.102
It's okay.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.273
Okay. I got to go.

13:37.341 --> 13:40.610
Um, I'll come back,
and I'll see you when I can.

13:43.172 --> 13:44.047
Listen, Charlie.

13:44.081 --> 13:45.048
Yeah?

13:47.184 --> 13:51.220
I-I'm trying to remember my life. I-I am.

13:51.255 --> 13:54.157
I mean, I'm-I'm just trying
to get up and-and walk.

13:54.224 --> 13:58.127
I need to-to focus on that,

13:58.162 --> 14:01.531
so could you...

14:01.565 --> 14:03.866
could you please just give me some space?

14:07.938 --> 14:10.539
Yeah, of... course.

14:28.824 --> 14:31.460
That's really hurting, guys!
It's really hurting!

14:31.494 --> 14:33.528
That's the vibrations.
It's like it's on fire again.

14:33.563 --> 14:34.862
Okay, let me just change it
to a lower speed.

14:36.031 --> 14:37.532
There you go. Let's try this.

14:39.569 --> 14:41.535
No, that's worse!

14:41.570 --> 14:42.590
Stop! Please stop!

14:42.652 --> 14:43.766
Guys, I wish I could make this easier.

14:43.816 --> 14:45.707
Unfortunately, I can't give you
any more pain medication.

14:45.741 --> 14:47.508
Wait, wait, what is that? What is what?

14:47.542 --> 14:50.344
My... my legs are warm, and they're wet.

14:50.378 --> 14:51.579
Is one of us bleeding?

14:51.614 --> 14:53.648
It's not blood. It's urine.

14:53.716 --> 14:56.084
Marshall, can you not feel that happening?

14:56.151 --> 14:58.685
What? What? Yeah, um... yeah,
I'm just gonna sit here,

14:58.753 --> 15:00.087
and I'm gonna wet myself.

15:00.155 --> 15:01.388
I'm-I'm sorry. I'm so embarrassed.

15:01.423 --> 15:02.789
No, don't worry.

15:02.824 --> 15:04.791
It's... it's okay. It's okay.

15:04.826 --> 15:06.127
Marshall, talk to me. Can you feel that?

15:06.194 --> 15:08.195
- Can you still feel that?
- No.

15:08.230 --> 15:10.331
And what about this?

15:10.365 --> 15:11.732
Uh, yeah, a little, a little.

15:11.766 --> 15:13.433
Can you please tell me what's happening?

15:15.269 --> 15:17.871
Loss of bladder control could
signify spinal-cord injury.

15:17.905 --> 15:20.807
- So, m-my back is broken?
- We don't know that yet.

15:20.875 --> 15:23.176
But we can't risk making it
worse until he is sure.

15:23.210 --> 15:25.545
I'm sorry, guys. I can't cut you apart.

15:26.748 --> 15:27.714
I just can't.

15:27.749 --> 15:30.916
No. No. No.

15:35.080 --> 15:36.075
So, if we're gonna jog your memory,

15:36.109 --> 15:37.744
you want to check out the E.R. first?

15:37.812 --> 15:39.612
It's crazy today. You'll love it.

15:39.647 --> 15:41.180
Seems like a strange thing to love.

15:41.248 --> 15:42.849
Nah.

15:43.172 --> 15:45.084
Here we go. You see her up there?

15:45.118 --> 15:46.118
Who's that?

15:46.153 --> 15:48.455
I have no idea.

15:48.489 --> 15:50.089
That's Melanda, a friend of yours.

15:50.123 --> 15:51.623
She's been on-and-off sleeping
with Zach from the E.R.

15:51.691 --> 15:53.893
they think people don't know,
but everybody does.

15:53.927 --> 15:55.194
Hey, lady.

15:55.229 --> 15:56.562
Great to see you're rolling around.

15:56.596 --> 15:58.030
Don't go pushing her around too much, okay?

15:58.065 --> 15:59.431
We're good.

15:59.466 --> 16:01.200
What about him up there? No, right there.

16:01.235 --> 16:03.435
Tall, skinny latte in the blazer.

16:03.470 --> 16:05.804
That's, uh, Gavin. He came to see me.

16:05.839 --> 16:08.106
Oh, see? You're progressing.

16:08.174 --> 16:09.842
- Hey, Alex.
- Hi.

16:09.876 --> 16:11.276
He just broke up with Maggie,

16:11.310 --> 16:13.078
so it's gonna be crazy awkward around here,

16:13.112 --> 16:15.714
but I did make 50 bucks in the breakup pool.

16:15.749 --> 16:17.015
There's a breakup pool?

16:19.018 --> 16:20.419
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:20.453 --> 16:21.854
Are you getting tired of doing laps?

16:21.888 --> 16:23.455
They just... they told me to rest,

16:23.490 --> 16:24.655
but just I'm feeling
all worked up, you know?

16:24.690 --> 16:26.291
I just want to get out of here,

16:26.325 --> 16:29.394
but that awful blonde robot won't let me go.

16:29.428 --> 16:31.396
- Oh, she means Dr. Bell.
- Oh.

16:31.430 --> 16:33.831
Marisol here is ready to go home.

16:33.900 --> 16:35.318
Maybe you should sit down, relax.

16:35.417 --> 16:37.102
I'll get one of the ward nurses
to check on you, okay?

16:37.136 --> 16:38.208
Would you?!

16:38.282 --> 16:39.938
Because I'm about ready
to bust out of this place!

16:40.006 --> 16:41.739
- Okay.
- Okay.

16:41.774 --> 16:44.742
- Okay.
- So, is there any gossip about me?

16:44.777 --> 16:46.611
Oh, we don't got enough time for that.

16:49.715 --> 16:53.217
Well... it's like two vacation slides

16:53.251 --> 16:54.886
on top of each other.

16:54.920 --> 16:56.521
- This... what is all this?
- Debris from the collapse.

16:56.555 --> 16:57.888
It's all mixed up in the foam there.

16:57.923 --> 16:59.456
I mean, I thought I...

16:59.490 --> 17:01.325
I might be able to make out
a fracture in there.

17:01.359 --> 17:04.361
- It's... it's not conclusive at all.
- Yeah, that is a conundrum.

17:04.396 --> 17:07.313
It certainly is, Dr. Harris.
Do you have any suggestions?

17:07.363 --> 17:08.656
Well, you knew better than me before, Joel,

17:08.705 --> 17:09.366
so what happened?

17:09.401 --> 17:10.599
Didn't say I knew better than you before.

17:10.635 --> 17:12.036
I said to you the solvents would not work.

17:12.137 --> 17:13.116
They did not work.

17:13.181 --> 17:16.503
Actually, your exact words were,
um, "I got this one, mate."

17:17.141 --> 17:18.974
The fact remains we still have a job to do.

17:19.009 --> 17:20.609
Okay.

17:23.315 --> 17:25.482
Forget it. I'll work it out
with Dana. Thank you.

17:29.854 --> 17:31.887
Ah. Hey, Dr. Lin. Where you been?

17:31.922 --> 17:34.157
'Cause you kind of just left me hanging here

17:34.224 --> 17:35.524
- a little bit.
- I know. I know.

17:35.559 --> 17:36.960
I'm sorry, Carl. That was unprofessional.

17:37.027 --> 17:37.961
Yeah.

17:38.028 --> 17:39.662
Uh, as I was saying,

17:39.696 --> 17:40.830
you sustained no serious
injuries from the collapse,

17:40.864 --> 17:41.934
but...

17:41.986 --> 17:44.100
but, yeah, see, that's where
you left off last time.

17:44.134 --> 17:46.708
I got that part, so... but what?

17:46.789 --> 17:49.872
Uh, but we found something.

17:49.906 --> 17:50.840
Oh.

17:50.907 --> 17:52.174
Something kind of...

17:52.208 --> 17:54.565
Oh, god. Oh, no.

17:54.822 --> 17:56.050
No, no.

17:56.100 --> 17:57.312
How long do I got?

17:57.347 --> 17:58.814
And what... are you smiling?

17:58.849 --> 18:02.017
Uh, no. I'm, uh... I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

18:02.051 --> 18:04.186
It's not you. It's, uh... it's my stuff.

18:04.220 --> 18:06.054
- Please, just a moment.
- But you got... hey!

18:06.089 --> 18:08.690
Dr. Lin, you can't do this to me!

18:11.294 --> 18:13.295
Oh, my god. Please make it stop.

18:13.329 --> 18:15.563
Please, please, make it stop.

18:25.508 --> 18:27.475
Uh, are you okay?

18:27.510 --> 18:32.346
Apart from completely crapping
the bed in the E.R. today?

18:32.381 --> 18:35.321
Okay. Good luck with that.

18:36.110 --> 18:39.086
Do you know how frustrating
it is that the only person

18:39.154 --> 18:40.821
who can help me with
what I'm going through today

18:40.855 --> 18:42.656
is the last person I can talk to?

18:44.659 --> 18:46.160
What are you going through, Maggie?

18:46.194 --> 18:47.689
Don't you dare be sympathetic.

18:48.036 --> 18:51.752
Okay. How do you want me to be?

18:51.867 --> 18:52.666
I don't know if you've heard,

18:52.700 --> 18:54.735
but there was a major catastrophe today.

18:54.769 --> 18:56.369
People are very upset down here.

18:56.437 --> 18:58.928
So if you're done with cuddle therapy,

18:58.978 --> 19:00.280
or whatever it is you do,

19:00.330 --> 19:01.629
maybe you could actually do your job

19:01.679 --> 19:02.943
and come down here and give us some backup.

19:02.977 --> 19:04.277
That's why I'm here.

19:04.311 --> 19:06.813
Well, don't inconvenience yourself.

19:08.282 --> 19:10.417
You broke up with me, remember?

19:12.850 --> 19:14.360
Okay, Marshall,

19:14.703 --> 19:17.692
because we couldn't get
a decent image of your spinal column there,

19:17.770 --> 19:20.004
unfortunately, we don't truly
know what's going on with it.

19:20.066 --> 19:21.671
Uh, okay. So, what now?

19:21.721 --> 19:22.895
Well, we're gonna play it safe.

19:22.963 --> 19:24.364
I'm gonna take you up to the O.R.

19:24.398 --> 19:26.098
I'm gonna peel the foam away from your skin

19:26.166 --> 19:27.619
slowly and carefully.

19:27.675 --> 19:29.234
Quite honestly, it's the safest way
for us to assess your injuries.

19:29.269 --> 19:31.837
Okay. How long is that gonna take?

19:31.872 --> 19:33.138
I'm not gonna lie to you.

19:33.206 --> 19:34.941
It's, uh... it's gonna take a while.

19:35.008 --> 19:36.742
And it's gonna be uncomfortable.

19:36.777 --> 19:38.555
Okay, well, let's just get it over with.

19:38.623 --> 19:41.313
Anna, this is gonna work.

19:41.347 --> 19:45.217
I kn... I know, but...
can you just do me first?

19:45.532 --> 19:48.554
Please? I'm feeling... I just...

19:48.588 --> 19:50.189
it's very painful and claustrophobic,

19:50.223 --> 19:53.175
and I just... I just need to
have this off me

19:53.225 --> 19:55.360
- now!
- Okay, Anna. Anna. Anna. Anna. Hey.

19:55.395 --> 19:57.429
It's gonna be all right, okay?
Do her first, please.

19:57.464 --> 20:00.098
Quite honestly, Marshall, that can't happen.

20:00.165 --> 20:01.967
Anna, hey. Hey.

20:02.001 --> 20:04.769
Look at me. Look at me. Anna, hey.

20:04.804 --> 20:07.371
We're gonna get out of this.
Okay, real soon, okay?

20:07.406 --> 20:09.240
The both of us.

20:09.274 --> 20:12.611
And then you're gonna be back
with your boyfriend.

20:12.645 --> 20:14.512
Marshall, don't do...

20:14.546 --> 20:16.514
It's okay. It's okay.

20:16.548 --> 20:18.349
He's right.

20:18.383 --> 20:19.717
You know, you've got strong drugs

20:19.751 --> 20:21.352
and the best surgeons in the business,

20:21.386 --> 20:23.154
so you're gonna be sleeping
in separate beds in no time.

20:23.188 --> 20:25.556
Okay. Okay. Okay.

20:25.591 --> 20:27.325
Marshall, what is it?

20:28.185 --> 20:29.218
You okay? What is it?

20:29.268 --> 20:30.027
I can't feel my hand.

20:30.095 --> 20:31.529
What do you mean, you can't feel your hand?

20:31.563 --> 20:32.329
Why can't I feel my hand?
I can't feel my hand.

20:32.363 --> 20:34.464
What... what...

20:34.532 --> 20:36.667
Hold that.

20:37.187 --> 20:38.561
What about the other one?

20:39.065 --> 20:40.426
Can you feel this hand, Marshall?

20:40.476 --> 20:41.367
W... a-are you touching it?

20:41.417 --> 20:43.173
- Yes, I am touching it right now.
- Well, I can't feel it, okay?

20:43.207 --> 20:44.708
I can't feel either one of my hands!

20:46.878 --> 20:49.679
I mean, it could be ascending paralysis.

20:49.713 --> 20:52.081
The swelling is compressing
the spinal column.

20:52.116 --> 20:53.950
Okay. I can't feel my hands, okay?

20:54.018 --> 20:56.019
Doesn't that mean... does that
mean I'm a quadriplegic?

20:56.053 --> 20:57.554
Okay, we need to operate on this
gentleman straightaway, please.

20:57.588 --> 20:58.888
L-like this? How?!

20:59.705 --> 21:01.090
I'll find a way.

21:06.496 --> 21:08.297
So, I believe Marshall
has an epidural hematoma

21:08.331 --> 21:09.498
tracking up his spine.

21:09.533 --> 21:10.633
Based on?

21:10.701 --> 21:12.135
Well, we have sketchy imaging.

21:12.169 --> 21:13.524
I'm going off a neurological exam.

21:13.620 --> 21:15.538
Well, if we don't move fast,
he's gonna be paralyzed, Dawn.

21:15.572 --> 21:17.206
Can I ask why he's part
of this conversation?

21:17.240 --> 21:19.589
We're not seeing any progress
with these patients.

21:19.639 --> 21:21.582
I think we need to look at all the options.

21:21.746 --> 21:23.197
- You had your shot, Joel.
- Listen to me.

21:23.247 --> 21:25.103
I need to operate right now,
while these patients

21:25.153 --> 21:26.566
are still attached to one another, okay?

21:26.616 --> 21:28.881
It's an extremely difficult operation.

21:29.101 --> 21:30.493
I'm just the more flexible surgeon.

21:30.543 --> 21:31.960
I didn't realize this was yoga.

21:32.010 --> 21:33.021
Okay, you know what, Charles?

21:33.056 --> 21:34.756
Right now it kind of is, okay?

21:34.824 --> 21:36.738
I have to rig that O.R. table
and tilt the patients down

21:36.788 --> 21:38.700
in such a way that I have access
to Marshall's spine.

21:38.814 --> 21:39.665
I wouldn't waste time with the rig.

21:39.715 --> 21:42.320
I'd operate on him right now, as
he is, in the lateral position.

21:42.893 --> 21:44.299
Okay, have either of you done anything

21:44.333 --> 21:46.434
even remotely like this before?

21:49.478 --> 21:50.939
No. I didn't think so.

21:51.195 --> 21:52.207
He's a single father.

21:52.241 --> 21:53.408
He needs his mobility to make a living.

21:53.442 --> 21:54.642
I'm the more senior surgeon.

21:54.677 --> 21:56.544
And while that might be the case,

21:56.579 --> 21:57.812
you're just not as good as I am, mate.

21:57.846 --> 21:59.086
I'm sorry. There, I said it.

21:59.163 --> 22:00.615
Recently deceased patients would disagree.

22:00.649 --> 22:02.049
Do you want to have another go at me, Joel?

22:02.084 --> 22:03.017
You know what?
I'd actually love that chance.

22:03.051 --> 22:05.386
- Is that right?
- Yes.
- Boys!

22:05.421 --> 22:06.821
Don't make this about Alex.

22:06.855 --> 22:09.824
- It's not about Alex.
- It's not about her.

22:10.931 --> 22:12.385
Put away the tape measure.

22:14.855 --> 22:15.993
Charlie, it's your surgery.

22:16.043 --> 22:17.331
- Thank you, Dawn.
- Well...

22:17.633 --> 22:19.166
You're making a huge mistake here.

22:19.201 --> 22:20.801
Joel, it's nothing against you.

22:20.869 --> 22:22.903
You asked me to make a call, and I made it.

22:34.885 --> 22:37.140
He's still feeling
some pain in his lower arm.

22:37.190 --> 22:41.130
We're just going to
up the fentanyl dosage, okay?

22:41.164 --> 22:43.265
I need you to do this for me.

22:43.333 --> 22:44.534
Do what?

22:46.269 --> 22:47.769
Carl Palansky.

22:47.804 --> 22:49.104
You haven't told him yet?

22:49.172 --> 22:51.046
I tried. I can't. I can't do it.

22:51.096 --> 22:53.608
Maggie, I don't have time for this, okay?

22:53.643 --> 22:55.210
You wanted me to laugh.

22:57.220 --> 23:00.749
For Pete's sake. I told you it worked.

23:03.062 --> 23:04.686
- Hi.
- Hey.

23:04.720 --> 23:05.336
You know what?

23:05.386 --> 23:07.555
This woman should be medicated,
straight up, okay?

23:08.295 --> 23:10.136
Okay, Maggie.
Thank you very much. Thank you.

23:10.186 --> 23:10.959
Seriously?

23:11.076 --> 23:12.905
I am so sorry, sir.

23:12.967 --> 23:15.152
Um, we got your imaging back,

23:15.235 --> 23:17.766
and, uh, it appears that you have

23:18.330 --> 23:20.576
something lodged in your rectum.

23:20.876 --> 23:22.470
A what, now?

23:22.537 --> 23:24.005
We don't know what it is,

23:24.055 --> 23:26.207
but it is something with a battery...

23:26.241 --> 23:29.710
maybe an oddly shaped vibrator,
some kind of toy?

23:29.778 --> 23:31.230
Anything like that ring a bell?

23:31.280 --> 23:33.019
Of course not.

23:34.198 --> 23:38.018
Maybe you had a few drinks one night

23:38.052 --> 23:42.022
and just sort of... misplaced something.

23:44.292 --> 23:46.176
Oh. Okay. Okay. Yeah.

23:46.235 --> 23:48.636
Okay, so, listen, we're just gonna, um,

23:48.986 --> 23:49.898
- sedate you.
- Okay.

23:49.970 --> 23:52.900
I'll take care of it now, if, uh, you know,

23:52.950 --> 23:55.793
you promise to be more careful
in your recreational time.

23:55.843 --> 23:56.957
Oh, uh, okay.

23:57.007 --> 23:59.847
Um... it's... but I'm not... I'm not dying.

24:00.206 --> 24:01.855
No, sir, you are not dying.

24:01.942 --> 24:03.972
I th... I thought I was
because of that woman.

24:04.022 --> 24:05.711
I... I started to write my will.

24:05.779 --> 24:09.115
And my... my brother's coming in
from Kingston.

24:09.213 --> 24:10.417
- Okay, well...
- You know?

24:10.467 --> 24:11.872
- You've, uh...
- I...

24:11.937 --> 24:14.253
Got a couple hours
to come up with a good story.

24:14.632 --> 24:16.881
Can I have my picture?

24:18.091 --> 24:19.744
Hey, Alex. How you doing?

24:19.932 --> 24:21.572
Good. Uh, thanks.

24:21.622 --> 24:22.659
Uh, who was that?

24:22.709 --> 24:24.045
Dr. Reycraft.

24:24.234 --> 24:25.753
Uh, is he a friend, too?

24:25.827 --> 24:27.675
He's a mystery.

24:28.185 --> 24:29.968
Okay.

24:30.003 --> 24:31.945
Okay, don't move. I'll be right back.

24:32.772 --> 24:35.374
All right.

24:58.464 --> 24:59.730
- Alex!
- Alex!

24:59.765 --> 25:00.859
Hey!

25:00.933 --> 25:02.873
- You okay?
- Uh, yeah. I'm-I'm fine.

25:02.923 --> 25:04.810
- I'm-I'm okay.
- No, I've got you. I've got you.

25:04.860 --> 25:06.509
- I'm just gonna sit you down.
- Charlie, I'm-I'm fine.

25:06.589 --> 25:07.997
I'm just gonna sit you down.

25:08.050 --> 25:09.455
- Okay.
- Okay?

25:09.600 --> 25:10.770
Okay.

25:11.751 --> 25:13.218
I'm gonna check your stitches.
Did you rip them?

25:13.292 --> 25:15.613
No, just don't, okay? I...

25:17.315 --> 25:18.555
Charlie, I-I know that you feel like

25:18.626 --> 25:20.777
you need to take care of me, okay?

25:22.807 --> 25:25.462
But I asked you to give me some space,
and...

25:26.749 --> 25:28.590
I need you to respect that.

25:33.953 --> 25:37.103
Anna, we're gonna sedate you,
and you won't feel any pain.

25:37.208 --> 25:38.588
I'm gonna be awake?

25:38.687 --> 25:40.956
Yes, we don't put patients under
unless we need to.

25:41.027 --> 25:43.258
- I'd rather you knock me out.
- I know.

25:43.391 --> 25:45.542
But, um, we need to hear from you

25:45.577 --> 25:47.511
if you start feeling worse.

25:49.382 --> 25:51.414
You guys have been stuck
together for how long now?

25:51.464 --> 25:53.008
Feels like forever.

25:53.203 --> 25:55.372
So, you're basically old friends.

25:56.186 --> 25:58.822
Maybe now's a good time
to wish each other luck.

26:00.363 --> 26:01.836
Hey.

26:03.625 --> 26:05.661
I'll see you on the other side, I guess.

26:05.695 --> 26:07.463
Aren't you afraid?

26:07.997 --> 26:09.597
Terrified.

26:09.951 --> 26:11.324
About today...

26:11.374 --> 26:15.204
- what you asked me before the explosion.
- Forget it. It was stupid, okay?

26:16.560 --> 26:18.874
Let's just-just pretend
it never happened.

26:18.908 --> 26:19.844
It's okay.

26:19.894 --> 26:22.878
- Okay. If you say so.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.751
You're gonna be okay.

26:33.957 --> 26:36.022
So, what's it like
being a patient in this place?

26:36.215 --> 26:40.662
Well, I-I hurt all over,
and everybody keeps prodding me

26:40.729 --> 26:42.364
and telling me what to do,

26:42.398 --> 26:45.500
and I'm so tired that I can't even make it

26:45.568 --> 26:46.536
to the end of the hall.

26:46.613 --> 26:48.282
What, to the end of that hall?

26:48.332 --> 26:49.662
You're not missing much.

26:49.747 --> 26:51.810
Well, I'm pretty much missing everything.

26:51.860 --> 26:53.086
Just saying.

26:54.880 --> 26:57.503
Well, maybe I could help you with that.

26:58.147 --> 26:58.911
How?

26:58.961 --> 27:00.302
Idea.

27:01.054 --> 27:03.944
Why don't I tell you
three things about yourself,

27:04.044 --> 27:07.689
and two of these things will be true.

27:07.750 --> 27:10.585
One will be less than true.

27:10.635 --> 27:11.755
What do I get if I'm right?

27:11.835 --> 27:15.908
How about I write down for you,

27:15.972 --> 27:19.276
on a single piece of paper, everything...

27:19.495 --> 27:21.333
everything you need to know about yourself?

27:21.414 --> 27:23.468
All right. You're on.

27:23.602 --> 27:24.834
Number one.

27:24.949 --> 27:28.691
You and I prevented a viral outbreak

27:28.758 --> 27:31.262
from going pandemic by spending
an afternoon in quarantine.

27:31.339 --> 27:33.065
Mm-hmm. Next?

27:33.139 --> 27:34.322
Number two.

27:34.451 --> 27:36.913
You and I once saw a cashier
get shot in a gas station,

27:37.016 --> 27:39.050
and you personally transfused your own blood

27:39.124 --> 27:42.885
directly into this woman's arm,
thus saving her life.

27:43.057 --> 27:44.907
Oh, come on. I did not do that.

27:44.958 --> 27:45.977
Number three.

27:46.157 --> 27:49.709
In medical school,
we entered a dance competition

27:49.786 --> 27:53.533
and came third place
out of over 100 entrants.

27:54.035 --> 27:57.587
The gas-station transfusion...
that-that is total B.S.

27:57.667 --> 27:58.763
Is that your final answer?

27:58.857 --> 28:00.406
- Am I right?
- You are not.

28:00.441 --> 28:01.871
What?! Come on.

28:01.948 --> 28:03.572
Sorry. Correct answer was number three.

28:03.658 --> 28:05.304
We never entered a dance contest?

28:05.365 --> 28:07.412
We did, but you're a terrible dancer,

28:07.447 --> 28:09.007
so we came in second to last.

28:09.152 --> 28:11.874
Well, at least we finished
ahead of one couple.

28:12.009 --> 28:15.400
That's interesting.
I never said we were a couple.

28:15.535 --> 28:17.007
You didn't have to.

28:19.682 --> 28:22.327
But we are not one anymore.

28:23.185 --> 28:26.078
No, we are not.

28:26.499 --> 28:28.333
Okay. You didn't win.

28:28.368 --> 28:29.801
But, um...

28:33.172 --> 28:36.808
I will write this down for you anyway.

28:38.218 --> 28:41.262
And I will leave it in the lobby

28:41.336 --> 28:45.823
so that if you feel like
stepping out for a walk,

28:47.424 --> 28:49.545
your prize awaits you.

28:51.139 --> 28:53.467
I like you, don't I?

29:06.182 --> 29:07.902
Are we there yet?

29:09.239 --> 29:11.425
I'm just relieving the pressure on his spine

29:11.492 --> 29:13.527
so the damage doesn't become permanent.

29:13.978 --> 29:16.079
Just try to relax, Anna.

29:17.140 --> 29:19.930
Hey, you sure you don't want us
to call your boyfriend?

29:20.171 --> 29:22.152
Always nice to wake up to a familiar face.

29:22.187 --> 29:23.330
No.

29:27.024 --> 29:27.956
There's someone else.

29:28.006 --> 29:29.232
Oh!

29:30.090 --> 29:32.742
So, uh... so, who's the other guy?

29:32.895 --> 29:35.263
You're operating on him.

29:37.033 --> 29:40.268
When the building fell on us,
he tried to protect me.

29:40.337 --> 29:41.806
Sounds like a good dude.

29:41.856 --> 29:43.223
He is.

29:45.300 --> 29:46.990
I'm getting really tired.

29:47.040 --> 29:48.794
It's okay to close your eyes.

29:49.045 --> 29:51.146
Thank you.

29:56.796 --> 29:58.636
Dr. Harris, we got a problem.

29:58.729 --> 30:00.889
Check the leads. That can't be right.

30:05.141 --> 30:06.327
Charlie.

30:06.395 --> 30:07.428
Mm-hmm?

30:07.463 --> 30:09.129
It's not him.

30:10.400 --> 30:12.004
It's her.

30:14.093 --> 30:16.668
Anna? Anna?

30:16.718 --> 30:17.867
Anna.

30:19.674 --> 30:21.408
Stet.

30:24.145 --> 30:25.333
How's she doing, Reycraft?

30:25.404 --> 30:27.352
I don't know. Give me a sec.

30:31.415 --> 30:32.771
Charlie, your patient's bleeding.

30:32.821 --> 30:34.217
- What?
- ABD.

30:34.267 --> 30:36.458
She's hypotensive.

30:36.641 --> 30:38.782
But he's the one who's bleeding.

30:42.162 --> 30:43.343
What if it's not his blood?

30:43.429 --> 30:44.918
What are you saying, it's hers?

30:44.968 --> 30:45.827
How?

30:45.877 --> 30:47.399
She's got a puncture wound somewhere.

30:47.449 --> 30:48.598
Yeah, where?

30:49.549 --> 30:51.304
Look, we need to separate them right away

30:51.338 --> 30:52.221
or she's gonna bleed out.

30:52.278 --> 30:54.036
We can't separate them
or we risk paralyzing him.

30:54.086 --> 30:56.164
If we don't, we risk her life.

31:00.180 --> 31:02.236
Okay, get the saw ready.

31:02.590 --> 31:03.924
Let's have some bodies standing by

31:03.974 --> 31:05.675
for when we separate, and...

31:06.086 --> 31:08.864
Somebody page Dr. Goran.

31:29.339 --> 31:30.996
Okay, once we've got them separated,

31:31.031 --> 31:33.399
we're gonna need all hands to log-roll them.

31:33.433 --> 31:36.235
The spine is vulnerable
until he's instrumented.

31:50.416 --> 31:52.751
Okay. Okay, they're separated.

31:52.818 --> 31:54.819
Now let's just roll him enough
to get her free.

31:54.854 --> 31:57.283
Bring the stretcher in here right now.

31:58.157 --> 32:01.034
Okay, hold that.

32:01.195 --> 32:02.727
And on three with me, okay, buddy?

32:02.762 --> 32:05.417
One, two, three.

32:08.733 --> 32:09.345
Okay.

32:09.395 --> 32:10.768
Oh, there's the bleed! There's the bleed!

32:10.802 --> 32:12.670
ABDs. ABDs. I got it.

32:12.737 --> 32:14.272
Hand me the towel. Hand me the towel!

32:14.339 --> 32:15.940
Keep pressure.

32:15.974 --> 32:17.408
All right, let's get her to another O.R.

32:17.443 --> 32:19.043
And tell Dr. Lin I need some hands, okay?

32:19.078 --> 32:21.511
Let's move it.

32:30.455 --> 32:32.289
Your eyes are red. You been crying?

32:32.323 --> 32:35.993
Crying, laughing, angry outbursts.

32:36.061 --> 32:37.694
That's 'cause you're all bottled up, Lin.

32:38.796 --> 32:42.199
Hey, primal scream. Try it.

32:42.266 --> 32:44.101
I scream into my pillow every morning.

32:44.135 --> 32:45.602
Wakes me right up.

32:45.636 --> 32:47.966
And explains
why you don't have a girlfriend.

32:48.323 --> 32:49.806
Huh.

32:51.109 --> 32:52.476
Thanks for answering the page.

32:52.543 --> 32:53.810
You got it, man.

32:53.844 --> 32:55.478
You're in a good mood.

32:55.545 --> 32:56.980
I saw Alex.

32:58.616 --> 33:01.517
You know, she still
has the memory loss, but I...

33:01.585 --> 33:03.319
her spirits are really up.

33:03.386 --> 33:06.022
I think... I think
she's gonna be okay, you know?

33:06.056 --> 33:07.123
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

33:07.190 --> 33:09.225
Probably best not to rush her.

33:12.683 --> 33:14.528
What is that?

33:38.254 --> 33:40.055
Well, what do you know?

33:40.089 --> 33:42.723
What do you know?

33:50.166 --> 33:52.767
Hi. Did somebody
leave something here for me?

33:52.834 --> 33:54.269
Thank you.

33:54.336 --> 33:58.005
That's great.

33:58.544 --> 34:00.407
Hey, Marisol. They're letting you go?

34:00.475 --> 34:02.710
Yeah, I finally got my walking papers.

34:02.919 --> 34:05.112
And now I'm not feeling so good.

34:05.365 --> 34:06.446
Really? What's the matter?

34:06.514 --> 34:09.315
I don't know. My neck is killing me.

34:09.704 --> 34:10.885
And I'm...

34:10.935 --> 34:11.679
Marisol?

34:11.728 --> 34:14.822
Marisol.

34:39.478 --> 34:40.813
She's exhibiting signs of anxiety.

34:40.880 --> 34:42.716
She's got distended neck veins,

34:42.750 --> 34:44.550
and her heart sounds are muffled.

34:44.585 --> 34:46.385
We need a crash cart and a needle

34:46.420 --> 34:48.054
for an emergency pericardial centesis.

34:48.121 --> 34:49.589
And get Dr. Bell down here now.

34:55.195 --> 34:57.830
You're right about your hormones
being out of whack.

34:58.175 --> 35:00.324
So far out of whack.

35:00.374 --> 35:02.457
You're blaming everything
you're going through on body chemistry,

35:02.507 --> 35:04.850
but you know you have some
actual human emotions

35:04.900 --> 35:06.463
in there, too, right?

35:06.513 --> 35:08.040
Yeah.

35:10.537 --> 35:12.392
These feelings you're having...

35:12.791 --> 35:15.480
it's better to feel them than to fight them.

35:16.214 --> 35:17.983
You didn't just lose a baby or a partner.

35:18.017 --> 35:20.636
You lost a life
you'd already started living.

35:20.686 --> 35:22.621
I just broke up with a shrink, so...

35:22.688 --> 35:24.289
So you've had your fill of talk.

35:24.323 --> 35:27.225
Okay, well, we don't need to talk.

35:27.260 --> 35:30.562
What do you want me to do,
curl up with a ball of tissues

35:30.596 --> 35:32.830
and not come in to work for a week?

35:32.865 --> 35:34.966
Probably. But you won't do that.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.601
Probably not.

35:36.636 --> 35:38.502
There's this ritual.

35:38.570 --> 35:40.571
It's given a few of my patients
some comfort.

35:40.605 --> 35:42.106
Yeah, I'm not big on rituals.

35:42.141 --> 35:43.607
You big on crying in public?

35:44.249 --> 35:45.451
Point taken.

35:45.537 --> 35:46.624
This is what you do.

35:47.472 --> 35:50.693
You take all the hopes you had
for your baby,

35:50.764 --> 35:53.584
all the fears you have
about life moving forward.

35:53.652 --> 35:56.086
You write all of that on a piece of paper,

35:56.120 --> 35:59.423
and you read it out loud
in front of a burning candle.

35:59.491 --> 36:02.192
Is this something I do alone?

36:02.226 --> 36:03.694
You can do it however you want.

36:03.728 --> 36:06.029
Or you can not do it at all.

36:06.097 --> 36:09.966
But, like I said, it's up to you.

36:16.921 --> 36:18.608
Pulse is still fast and thready.

36:18.642 --> 36:21.043
All right, prep her. I'll be down in five.

36:27.779 --> 36:29.611
Let me check your incision.

36:29.695 --> 36:33.652
It's... it's fine, you know.
I just... little sore.

36:34.457 --> 36:36.692
Hospital is full of people
who could have done that, Alex.

36:36.726 --> 36:38.194
You could have opened that right up.

36:38.261 --> 36:41.096
I know. It was just reflex.

36:41.527 --> 36:42.764
Well, thank you.

36:43.407 --> 36:44.133
You wouldn't remember,

36:44.204 --> 36:46.615
but that's not something that
you hear from me very often.

36:47.322 --> 36:49.038
I remember you, Dawn.

36:58.617 --> 37:00.782
There you go. I was gonna
take your I.V. out anyway.

37:06.109 --> 37:08.370
You know, you had us
all pretty worried there for a while.

37:08.420 --> 37:09.858
I've heard that a lot today.

37:11.937 --> 37:14.942
Well, you won't hear it again from me.

37:15.546 --> 37:17.165
You saved my life.

37:20.110 --> 37:22.286
- Well, I...
- Thank you.

37:23.784 --> 37:25.928
Welcome back, Dr. Reid.

37:38.945 --> 37:42.146
Where is he? Where is Marshall?

37:42.181 --> 37:43.314
Dr. Goran and I operated on his spine.

37:43.382 --> 37:44.482
It went well.

37:44.516 --> 37:45.650
Thank god.

37:46.056 --> 37:47.072
Burns from the foam weren't as bad

37:47.122 --> 37:48.587
as they could have been, but, uh...

37:48.621 --> 37:50.474
- But he'll live.
- Yes.

37:50.524 --> 37:51.634
- He'll walk.
- Yes.

37:52.625 --> 37:54.225
He's with Dr. Kinney right now.

37:54.548 --> 37:55.426
You're next.

37:58.431 --> 38:01.983
Um, in surgery,
I told you about us, didn't I?

38:03.702 --> 38:06.360
That may have slipped out.

38:06.814 --> 38:08.639
We found this.

38:11.843 --> 38:15.479
I'm guessing that's what you said no to.

38:15.546 --> 38:17.047
Yeah.

38:17.082 --> 38:18.749
Mind if I ask why?

38:18.817 --> 38:21.885
I was scared.

38:24.122 --> 38:27.057
I didn't know what scared
really was until today.

38:28.459 --> 38:30.893
Yeah. It changes things.

38:31.740 --> 38:33.640
It changes everything.

38:34.945 --> 38:37.234
Do you want me to
give that back to him, or...

38:37.268 --> 38:39.336
or do you want to do it?

38:39.953 --> 38:41.441
Yeah.

38:42.206 --> 38:43.906
I'll do it.

39:14.303 --> 39:15.933
What do you want?

39:16.328 --> 39:17.839
I need to know.

39:17.907 --> 39:21.276
You need to know what?

39:21.310 --> 39:23.111
That she'll be all right.

39:23.146 --> 39:24.946
She's all right.

39:24.981 --> 39:28.784
And she'll be all right, so you can go now.

39:28.818 --> 39:30.418
Look for the big bright light

39:30.452 --> 39:32.984
and run like hell straight towards it.

39:33.296 --> 39:34.881
She's not all right.

39:35.224 --> 39:36.357
What?

39:38.288 --> 39:40.027
She left something behind.

39:40.252 --> 39:43.196
What the hell are you talking about?

40:07.589 --> 40:09.789
Dr. Reycraft.

40:09.824 --> 40:14.861
Dr. Bell.

40:14.929 --> 40:16.796
Apparently, I don't have a girlfriend.

40:16.831 --> 40:20.033
No, you don't.

40:20.067 --> 40:22.769
And that's how I like it.

41:41.280 --> 41:44.648
so, I hear you got your memory back.

41:44.683 --> 41:47.018
Yeah, all at once. It was kind of intense.

41:47.052 --> 41:50.521
I... yeah, I can imagine.

41:55.927 --> 42:00.130
Um, you remember I see things, right?

42:00.164 --> 42:01.298
Yes.

42:01.366 --> 42:04.000
Okay.

42:04.035 --> 42:08.604
Well, when you were in your coma...

42:08.639 --> 42:10.473
We were together.

42:10.541 --> 42:13.476
Huh.

42:13.544 --> 42:18.315
More together than
we've been... in a long time.

42:18.382 --> 42:20.516
You don't remember any of that?

42:22.218 --> 42:25.621
I-I remember our life together.

42:28.959 --> 42:33.229
I just... I don't, um...

42:33.263 --> 42:37.666
You don't what?

42:40.470 --> 42:45.194
You know what, I'm... I'm tired.

42:45.258 --> 42:48.310
Do you think we could talk about this later?

42:48.345 --> 42:53.182
Yeah. Of course.

43:00.722 --> 43:02.656
I love you.
