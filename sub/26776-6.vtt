09:46.886 --> 09:48.688
and save the CEO
of Twitflash!

09:48.754 --> 09:50.289
- I can't leave until I finish
this 10,001 piece puzzle!

09:50.356 --> 09:51.824
- Well, just use
your superfast reflexes!

09:51.891 --> 09:53.559
- What, you don't think
I thought of that?

09:53.626 --> 09:55.728
'Cuz I did not--
that's actually a great idea!

10:10.076 --> 10:11.644
- Honey, I'm hooo--

10:11.711 --> 10:13.512
ooooh, man I just ate
a lot of frozen yogurt.

10:13.579 --> 10:15.414
Gimme a sec.

10:15.481 --> 10:16.882
- Captain Man!

10:16.949 --> 10:21.721
I can't bee-lieve
you found my hiving spot.

10:21.787 --> 10:23.089
- Yeah look, I'm not
gonna be able to do

10:23.155 --> 10:24.991
alot of clever back-and-forth
right now.

10:25.057 --> 10:28.094
Dairy tends to back up
on me a little.

10:28.160 --> 10:33.065
- Well allow me to give
you a swarm welcome!

10:33.132 --> 10:36.035
- "Swarm."
That's actually really good.

10:38.537 --> 10:40.106
- Katelyn,
a little bit higher,...

10:40.172 --> 10:41.607
a lit--a little higher...

10:41.674 --> 10:43.142
That's good...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:43.209 --> 10:44.310
Ohhh yeah.

10:44.377 --> 10:45.411
- Schwoz!!!

10:45.478 --> 10:47.613
- Ahh! Ohhhh!

10:47.680 --> 10:49.782
What's on your problems?!

10:49.849 --> 10:51.684
- Remember when Captain Man
and Kid Danger

10:51.751 --> 10:54.353
fought that giant guy
who talked to a towel?

10:54.420 --> 10:56.655
- How could I forget?!

10:56.722 --> 10:58.624
But I did forget.
What about him?

10:58.691 --> 11:00.659
- He had the symbol
from the hostage video

11:00.726 --> 11:02.094
tattooed on his neck.

11:02.161 --> 11:03.963
And it was on the bottom
of his can of Flabber Gas.

11:04.030 --> 11:05.898
- Okay...

11:05.965 --> 11:07.800
- And the scientists
from Evil Science Corp

11:07.867 --> 11:09.702
had the symbol
on their uniforms.

11:09.769 --> 11:11.270
- What the hecks...

11:11.337 --> 11:12.505
- And when someone stole

11:12.571 --> 11:13.739
the world's most
poisonous cactus,

11:13.806 --> 11:15.641
they left a card
with that logo on it.

11:15.708 --> 11:17.209
- Oh my god!

11:17.276 --> 11:19.812
It was also on every
screen in the Man Cave

11:19.879 --> 11:20.880
when the computer
got hacked!

11:20.946 --> 11:22.448
- It was?!
- Yes!

11:22.515 --> 11:23.916
It's like
they've been fighting

11:23.983 --> 11:26.552
some secret team of bad guys
without knowing it.

11:26.619 --> 11:27.887
- I know!

11:27.953 --> 11:29.688
- Quick! Do a search
of that logo

11:29.755 --> 11:31.190
on all the public
images available

11:31.257 --> 11:33.793
while I make baby face
with Katelyn.

11:39.565 --> 11:41.333
- Oh my god...

11:41.400 --> 11:43.402
- Oh my god.

11:43.469 --> 11:46.705
Oh my god...

11:46.772 --> 11:49.675
Is what Katelyn would say
if she could talk.

11:51.577 --> 11:53.179
- Open the door!
- What's wrong with you?

11:53.245 --> 11:54.580
Let us in.

11:54.647 --> 11:56.215
- There's no such thing
as a puppy truck!

11:56.282 --> 11:59.385
- Jasper, stop enabling my son!
- Bro!

11:59.452 --> 12:01.921
- Done!
- Let's go!

12:01.987 --> 12:05.191
- Hoooold it right there,
young mans!

12:05.257 --> 12:06.492
- We finished the puzzle.
- Yea!

12:06.559 --> 12:07.893
- It was fun.
- Yea!

12:07.960 --> 12:08.928
- Really stuck it
to those Tetrazini's.

12:08.994 --> 12:10.596
- Hate them!
- Byeee...

12:10.663 --> 12:13.132
- Bye!

12:15.034 --> 12:17.970
- You're through,
Captain Man!

12:18.037 --> 12:22.108
Sorry to be
such a buzz kill!

12:25.211 --> 12:27.713
- You done?

12:27.780 --> 12:29.982
- Seriously, you're
not in any pain?

12:30.049 --> 12:33.853
There's like
a thousand bees on you.

12:33.919 --> 12:36.589
- I'm indestructible.
Bees can't sting me.

12:36.655 --> 12:39.892
So, if anything,
it just kinda tickles.

12:39.959 --> 12:44.864
- Okaaaayy...
what about wasps?!

12:49.368 --> 12:52.004
- [ burp laughs ]

12:52.071 --> 12:53.639
- Get out of the
honey factory, Ray!

12:53.706 --> 12:54.874
- Henry, do not go
to the honey factory!

12:54.940 --> 12:56.075
When you get this message,

12:56.142 --> 12:58.043
- As soon as you
get this message...

12:58.110 --> 13:00.613
- You are in great danger!
- It's a trap, Ray!

13:00.679 --> 13:02.815
You're walking into a trap!

13:12.258 --> 13:15.227
- Y-y-you saved my life!
Thank you so much!

13:15.294 --> 13:16.829
[ blasts ]
Ah!

13:16.896 --> 13:19.131
- You're welcome.
And hey look,

13:19.198 --> 13:20.833
I know you're
a billionaire and all,

13:20.900 --> 13:24.336
but I don't want
any reward money. Wink.

13:27.106 --> 13:29.842
- Well, where's Kid Danger?
- I dunno.

13:29.909 --> 13:31.911
Somewhere not
eating frozen yogurt.

13:31.977 --> 13:33.612
His loss.
[ burps ]

13:33.679 --> 13:37.983
- Oh...

13:38.050 --> 13:39.852
Okay.

13:39.919 --> 13:42.121
- Whatcha got there, fella?

13:42.188 --> 13:43.355
- A remote.

13:43.422 --> 13:44.890
- Oh yeah?

13:44.957 --> 13:46.292
I got a ton of those
in the Man Cave.

13:46.358 --> 13:47.326
What does that one do?

13:47.393 --> 13:48.494
- Springs a trap.

13:48.561 --> 13:50.629
- Oh yeah? On who?

13:50.696 --> 13:52.331
- You.

13:58.537 --> 14:01.006
Game on, Captain Man.

14:01.073 --> 14:05.678
- Grrrr!
[ laughing ]

14:05.744 --> 14:07.680
[ buzzing ]

14:07.746 --> 14:09.114
[ chokes ]

14:11.383 --> 14:12.918
Man I hate these bees!

14:19.959 --> 14:23.395
- [ laughing ]
- [ grunting ]

14:24.897 --> 14:28.334
- Alright. Okay, Rick.

14:28.400 --> 14:31.604
You've been laughing for like,
a really long time now.

14:31.670 --> 14:33.639
That's enough.
- I'm sorry...

14:33.706 --> 14:37.076
you just look
so ridiculous.

14:37.142 --> 14:39.612
- Well, I wasn't
expecting to be frozen

14:39.678 --> 14:41.513
by a man I had just saved.

14:41.580 --> 14:43.682
- Yeah,
that's the plasma gas.

14:43.749 --> 14:45.351
- Huh?
- Plasma. Gas.

14:45.417 --> 14:48.420
It's made from a chemical
in a very poisonous cactus

14:48.487 --> 14:50.623
I stole from the Swellview
Cactus Convention.

14:50.689 --> 14:53.726
- Oh, that was you.
- Uh-huh.

14:53.792 --> 14:55.261
- Well, good for you.

14:55.327 --> 14:56.895
Can we just
skip to the part

14:56.962 --> 14:59.131
where I punch you
and drag you to jail?

14:59.198 --> 15:00.633
- That's not gonna happen.

15:00.699 --> 15:02.101
- Yeah it is, Rick.

15:02.167 --> 15:04.036
I've fought a lot
of bad guys pal,

15:04.103 --> 15:05.271
and I always win.

15:05.337 --> 15:07.573
- I'm not you're
average bad guy,

15:07.640 --> 15:09.375
Ray Manchester.

15:11.944 --> 15:14.146
- Who's...that?

15:14.213 --> 15:15.981
- I hacked into
the Man Cave computer

15:16.048 --> 15:17.950
while you were
at Cactus Con.

15:18.017 --> 15:21.820
I know everything
about you.

15:21.887 --> 15:24.089
- No you don't.

15:24.156 --> 15:25.391
- Your name
is Ray Manchester.

15:25.457 --> 15:27.926
You own a fake store
above the Man Cave

15:27.993 --> 15:30.562
called Junk-N-Stuff.

15:30.629 --> 15:34.466
You tell people you're 36
when really you're...

15:34.533 --> 15:36.402
- No!
- 37.

15:36.468 --> 15:40.439
- Nooooooooo!!!!

15:43.275 --> 15:44.543
- Why would the guy
who founded Twitflash

15:44.610 --> 15:46.879
want to destroy Captain Man
and Kid Danger?

15:46.945 --> 15:49.848
- Maybe he doesn't want
to destroy them.

15:49.915 --> 15:51.216
[ gasps ]

15:51.283 --> 15:54.753
He wants to steal
Ray and Henry's powers!

15:54.820 --> 15:56.121
- Well how's he
gonna do that?

15:56.188 --> 15:59.124
- Oh, boy...
this is complicated.

15:59.191 --> 16:01.060
So I'm going to
explain it to you

16:01.126 --> 16:03.362
in my American accent.
- Okay.

16:03.429 --> 16:06.265
- But I can only do it
for so long before I pass out.

16:06.332 --> 16:08.334
- Then hurry!

16:12.137 --> 16:15.007
- Ray and Henry both got
sprayed with Flabber Gas.

16:15.074 --> 16:17.209
Now, you can counteract
its effects,

16:17.276 --> 16:19.345
but Flabber Gas never actually
leaves your body.

16:19.411 --> 16:21.680
And on Halloween,
when Ray and Henry

16:21.747 --> 16:24.049
went through the portal
at the Evil Science Corp,

16:24.116 --> 16:27.119
they were covered with
interdimensional bio-residue.

16:27.186 --> 16:30.189
That takes years
to wash off your skin.

16:30.255 --> 16:32.458
And Whistling Susie...
the old atomic bomb

16:32.524 --> 16:34.059
that was delivered
to the Man Cave...

16:34.126 --> 16:37.730
It dosed Ray and Henry
with gamma radiation.

16:37.796 --> 16:38.897
And finally...

16:38.964 --> 16:42.901
the diez leches cake.

16:42.968 --> 16:44.370
The tenth and final leche

16:44.436 --> 16:48.107
is what brings
it all together...

16:49.842 --> 16:52.578
- That's AMORE.

16:52.644 --> 16:53.912
- Love?

16:53.979 --> 16:55.347
- No...

16:55.414 --> 16:59.485
Anti-Macro
OxyRibonucleic Enzymes.

16:59.551 --> 17:02.888
- A-M-O-R-E.

17:02.955 --> 17:04.857
That is amore.

17:04.923 --> 17:06.558
- It sure is.
Charlotte.

17:06.625 --> 17:09.928
It sure is--

17:09.994 --> 17:12.397
- Wait, wha--
Wait. Wait, Schwoz!

17:12.464 --> 17:15.300
- ...the AMORE
molecule binds itself

17:15.367 --> 17:17.636
to the chemical
that makes you indestructible.

17:17.703 --> 17:19.304
This device locates AMORE,

17:19.371 --> 17:22.741
and pulls it from your body
along with your powers.

17:22.808 --> 17:23.909
- Sounds painful.

17:23.976 --> 17:25.277
- It's incredibly painful.

17:25.344 --> 17:27.913
- Luckily
I'm indestructible.

17:30.315 --> 17:32.885
- I just said I'm going to take
your indestructibility.

17:32.951 --> 17:36.722
- I'd like to hear how.

17:36.789 --> 17:38.257
- I've been telling you how!

17:38.323 --> 17:40.025
Have you not been
listening to any of this?

17:40.092 --> 17:42.227
- Yeah, I heard you--
blah-blah-blah,

17:42.294 --> 17:45.330
mmm-chemistry,
mmm-molecules,

17:45.397 --> 17:46.799
pbbbbbt.

17:46.865 --> 17:48.634
Look, Kid Danger's going
to show up any second now

17:48.700 --> 17:50.402
and punch a million holes
in your face.

17:50.469 --> 17:53.405
- Oh, really?
I highly doubt tha--

17:53.472 --> 17:56.375
- Ahhhh!

17:57.943 --> 17:59.812
- Kid!
I literally just said

17:59.878 --> 18:00.813
you were about to show up!

18:00.879 --> 18:02.147
- Oh yeah?
- Yes!

18:02.214 --> 18:03.482
- Like just now?
- Yeah, were you listening?

18:03.549 --> 18:04.950
- No, no, dude...
I just rolled up,

18:05.017 --> 18:06.185
saw the roof,
found a shaft,

18:06.251 --> 18:09.087
and just dropped on in.
- Noice!

18:09.154 --> 18:11.223
- So uh, who'd I land on?

18:11.290 --> 18:12.591
Good guy? Bad guy?
What are we talking here?

18:12.658 --> 18:14.259
- Bad guy is what
we're talking here.

18:14.326 --> 18:16.361
Rick Twitler.
Tried to steal my power.

18:16.428 --> 18:18.297
- Not cool, Rick Twitler!

18:18.363 --> 18:20.432
Ow!

18:20.499 --> 18:22.734
- Wait, wait, wait, wait,
I thought he was the hostage.

18:22.801 --> 18:24.036
- Fake.
- What happened

18:24.102 --> 18:25.270
to The Beekeeper
- Lasered.

18:25.337 --> 18:26.772
- Why are you
squatting like that?

18:26.839 --> 18:29.308
- Trapped.
- Zoinks.

18:29.374 --> 18:32.411
Wait, so why would
this dude kidnap himself

18:32.478 --> 18:34.112
and then try to steal
your super power?

18:34.179 --> 18:36.949
- I dunno,
I wasn't listening.

18:37.015 --> 18:39.918
- I was going to
take your super power

18:39.985 --> 18:43.188
and put it in this.

18:43.255 --> 18:44.990
- A lava lamp.

18:45.057 --> 18:47.092
- No.
- Oh.

18:47.159 --> 18:49.127
- It's a computer virus.

18:49.194 --> 18:52.631
A living, organic
computer virus.

18:52.698 --> 18:55.334
Nasty stuff...

18:55.400 --> 18:56.635
It's going to infect
every computer,

18:56.702 --> 19:00.672
every laptop,
and every phone on Earth.

19:00.739 --> 19:05.143
I'm going to destroy
the internet. Forever.

19:05.210 --> 19:07.246
- Not cool, Rick Twitler!

19:09.348 --> 19:11.250
- I have a question.
- Captain Man.

19:11.316 --> 19:12.718
- You invented Twitflash.

19:12.784 --> 19:14.520
- That is not a question,
but continue.

19:14.586 --> 19:15.988
- Why would you want
to destroy the internet?

19:16.054 --> 19:17.322
- That is a question.

19:17.389 --> 19:20.158
- Because the internet
ruined everything!

19:20.225 --> 19:21.793
It's partially my fault.

19:21.860 --> 19:25.330
Everyone just stares
at their phones all day now,

19:25.397 --> 19:27.633
scrolling through Twitflash.

19:27.699 --> 19:28.867
It's terrible.

19:28.934 --> 19:30.002
- But, dude...memes.

19:30.068 --> 19:31.236
- Memes are hilarious.

19:31.303 --> 19:32.871
- Like the one
with the...the rats.

19:32.938 --> 19:34.406
- Or the cat with a money.
- They're all in a circle.

19:34.473 --> 19:35.874
- Yeah and he's like,
"Aw Mondays!"

19:35.941 --> 19:37.075
- And it's like,
"Feeling old yet?"

19:37.142 --> 19:40.379
- I don't care
about memes!

19:40.445 --> 19:42.047
That's why I was
going to create

19:42.114 --> 19:44.149
an indestructible
computer virus

19:44.216 --> 19:46.218
with super fast reflexes,

19:46.285 --> 19:48.387
unleash it on the world,

19:48.453 --> 19:51.089
and destroy
the internet forever.

19:51.156 --> 19:54.059
- Mmmmm, not cool,
Rick Twitler!

19:54.126 --> 19:56.461
- Oh, come on!

19:56.528 --> 19:58.196
- Alright Kid, c'mon
get me outta this thing.

19:58.263 --> 20:00.132
My glutes are barkin'.

20:00.198 --> 20:02.034
- Alright, alright...

20:02.100 --> 20:03.335
Uhhhh...

20:03.402 --> 20:04.803
I don't see
an off button, dude...

20:04.870 --> 20:06.638
- Well just laser it.

20:06.705 --> 20:07.973
- I wouldn't do that.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.275
- Well now I'm
definitely gonna do it.

20:19.418 --> 20:20.919
- Kid, you made it worse!

20:20.986 --> 20:23.021
- I told you not to do that.

20:23.088 --> 20:24.389
- Shut up, Rick Twitler!

20:24.456 --> 20:26.892
- W-w-w-wait!
Let me explain something to you.

20:26.959 --> 20:28.393
- What?

20:28.460 --> 20:30.162
- I planned to steal
both of your superpowers.

20:30.228 --> 20:33.165
- Yeah?
- So I built two traps.

20:39.972 --> 20:41.807
- Not cool, Rick Twitler.

20:45.744 --> 20:47.346
- Gahhhh!

20:54.753 --> 20:56.888
- Say goodbye to your
super power, Kid Danger.

20:56.955 --> 20:58.690
- No.
- Okay.

20:58.757 --> 21:01.526
- What? No, wait, wait!
AHHHHHHHH!

21:27.986 --> 21:29.588
- See you in the Dark Ages.

21:29.655 --> 21:32.324
- Gah! Ahhh!

21:37.329 --> 21:40.699
- Hey, Kid. Are your
super-fast reflexes gone?

21:40.766 --> 21:42.868
- I don't know.

21:46.171 --> 21:48.573
- Here, catch.

21:52.144 --> 21:53.779
- Ow!

21:53.845 --> 21:55.747
- Yeah, they're gone.
