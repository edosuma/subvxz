<i>My name
is Carson Phillips.</i>

01:23.983 --> 01:25.350
<i>I'm a PI.</i>

01:27.285 --> 01:31.423
<i>I like to drink. I like to smoke.
I like to gamble.</i>

01:38.329 --> 01:40.264
<i>Sometimes, a little too much.</i>

01:41.365 --> 01:42.933
<i>But you know what they say.</i>

01:42.935 --> 01:44.701
<i>Everything in moderation.</i>

01:44.703 --> 01:46.471
<i>Including moderation.</i>

01:57.248 --> 01:59.716
<i>I figured I could've
taken these guys, but...</i>

01:59.718 --> 02:04.420
<i>last time I had uninvited
guests, they trashed my place</i>

02:04.422 --> 02:07.459
<i>and frankly, Raymond, my cat,
still hasn't gotten over it.</i>

02:10.696 --> 02:11.729
Uh-uh.

02:12.797 --> 02:14.430
I'm holding a cat.

02:14.432 --> 02:16.632
- What?
- You hold it.

02:18.937 --> 02:21.539
Damn it!

02:30.982 --> 02:32.184
Goddamn it!

02:35.553 --> 02:38.288
<i>I've been working
in LA for over 20 years.</i>

02:38.522 --> 02:40.756
<i>Whoever named this place
the City of Angels</i>

02:40.758 --> 02:43.294
<i>certainly had a terrific
sense of humor.</i>

02:45.329 --> 02:47.663
<i>Behind all the Hollywood
glitz and glam</i>

02:47.665 --> 02:49.397
<i>it's just like any other city.</i>

02:49.399 --> 02:52.600
<i>Except when the Santa Ana
winds blow hot off the desert</i>

02:52.602 --> 02:54.705
<i>and the unimaginable
suddenly turns real.</i>

02:55.306 --> 02:57.005
<i>People get a little more jumpy.</i>

02:57.007 --> 03:00.811
<i>Their skin starts to crawl.
And parties end with dead bodies.</i>

03:01.411 --> 03:03.279
<i>But I guess
that's entertainment.</i>

03:07.485 --> 03:09.519
<i>Most of my jobs
are pretty routine.</i>

03:09.720 --> 03:13.523
<i>Cheating spouses, deadbeat
dads, missing persons.</i>

03:13.790 --> 03:15.723
<i>But every once in a while,</i>

03:15.725 --> 03:18.863
<i>a case becomes something
I never saw coming.</i>

03:19.630 --> 03:22.432
You brought Raymond to work.
Who's after you this time?

03:23.633 --> 03:26.033
Well, you only bring Raymond in
when someone's after you

03:26.035 --> 03:28.002
and you gotta hide out.

03:28.004 --> 03:30.605
Aren't you cute when you're
not minding your own business?

03:30.607 --> 03:32.507
Take him for a few days.

03:32.509 --> 03:34.577
Sure thing, Carson.
By the way, someone's in your office.

03:36.112 --> 03:37.480
I can see that.

03:40.482 --> 03:41.816
Mr. Phillips?

03:41.818 --> 03:43.520
You seem surprised.

03:43.853 --> 03:46.888
I was just expecting
you'd look much older.

03:46.890 --> 03:49.456
You almost look like you
could suit up right now.

03:49.458 --> 03:51.895
You must know a little bit about my past.
Have a seat.

03:53.062 --> 03:55.830
I grew up in Galveston.
Oh, well.

03:55.832 --> 03:58.833
I thought I caught a little
bit of East Texas in there.

03:58.835 --> 04:00.602
You were something to watch.

04:10.579 --> 04:11.580
Flattery...

04:12.148 --> 04:13.814
It'll get you everywhere.

04:13.816 --> 04:15.916
I'm yours. How can I help you?

04:15.918 --> 04:19.654
Well, Mr. Phillips,
my aunt, Barbara Van Poole,

04:19.656 --> 04:22.689
is in a sanitarium
just outside of Galveston.

04:22.691 --> 04:23.826
Pleasant Meadows?

04:24.493 --> 04:25.794
I remember Pleasant Meadows.

04:27.029 --> 04:29.595
A few years back,
she had a complete nervous breakdown

04:29.597 --> 04:31.865
and she just hasn't
been well ever since.

04:31.867 --> 04:34.501
I used to call and
speak with her regularly,

04:34.503 --> 04:36.903
but now when I phone,
I just get the runaround.

04:36.905 --> 04:38.805
All I get are some
letters in the mail.

04:38.807 --> 04:43.610
Well, you see, I don't typically
do out-of-town jobs, so...

04:43.612 --> 04:46.613
Well, it's just that I don't
wanna hire anyone from there

04:46.615 --> 04:48.617
'cause I don't know
if I can trust them.

04:49.517 --> 04:51.385
How do you know
you can trust me?

04:51.920 --> 04:53.387
Hey, Carson.

04:54.857 --> 04:57.559
I think it might be a good idea for
you to get out of town for a few weeks.

04:58.160 --> 05:00.693
We're talking about
Galveston here.

05:00.695 --> 05:02.895
W-What's wrong with Galveston?

05:02.897 --> 05:05.433
Not a thing. Just not for me.

05:12.540 --> 05:13.908
Name your price, Carson.

05:25.853 --> 05:28.220
<i>A beautiful
woman with a sob story</i>

05:28.222 --> 05:30.424
<i>has always been
one of my weaknesses.</i>

05:30.725 --> 05:32.994
<i>Along with her having
an open checkbook...</i>

05:34.229 --> 05:36.430
<i>she became irresistible.</i>

05:37.832 --> 05:40.902
<i>The road has always been
a fascinating place for me.</i>

05:41.235 --> 05:43.869
<i>The drone of the tires
against the asphalt</i>

05:43.871 --> 05:47.942
<i>becomes this hypnotic chorus taking
me back to places I rarely go.</i>

05:58.920 --> 06:00.988
<i>There I was, back in Texas.</i>

06:01.655 --> 06:04.691
<i>The land of cowboys,
beautiful women,</i>

06:04.925 --> 06:06.859
<i>72 ounce steaks...</i>

06:06.861 --> 06:08.260
You won't be disappointed
in these steaks.

06:08.262 --> 06:10.195
<i>...and
the holiest of holy.</i>

06:22.642 --> 06:24.844
<i>A lot has happened
since I left Texas.</i>

06:25.645 --> 06:27.847
<i>The Beatles and Vietnam
had come and gone,</i>

06:29.716 --> 06:31.883
<i>Armstrong walked on the moon,</i>

06:31.885 --> 06:34.788
<i>and I drank enough bourbon
to fill the Cotton Bowl.</i>

06:36.823 --> 06:40.659
<i>Maybe I drank enough to finally
face the shame of my past.</i>

06:40.994 --> 06:45.229
<i>I ran out on Jayne,
the only woman I've ever loved,</i>

06:45.231 --> 06:47.899
<i>faster than I ever
ran on the field,</i>

06:47.901 --> 06:51.004
<i>after I disgraced myself
in that fateful final game.</i>

07:40.085 --> 07:41.120
Hello.

07:42.088 --> 07:43.756
We've been expecting you.

07:45.758 --> 07:47.924
You have?

07:47.926 --> 07:49.759
You're here as an observer
from the Institute, aren't you?

07:49.761 --> 07:51.030
Nope. I'm just...

07:52.097 --> 07:54.199
- here to visit a patient.
- A friend?

07:55.100 --> 07:57.067
What's your position?
Are you a doctor or something?

07:57.069 --> 07:59.138
No.
Paranoid schizophrenic.

08:00.105 --> 08:01.637
There she is.

08:01.639 --> 08:03.839
I have a cat that's paranoid.

08:03.841 --> 08:05.844
- It's time for session.
- Sorry, sir.

08:10.982 --> 08:14.085
<i>Bingo
at 3:30 in the sunroom.</i>

08:14.619 --> 08:15.851
<i>Now, don't forget everyone...</i>

08:15.853 --> 08:17.286
Howdy.
Howdy.

08:17.288 --> 08:19.655
Can I help you?

08:19.657 --> 08:22.325
Yeah. I'm here to see a patient of
yours by the name of Barbara Van Poole.

08:22.327 --> 08:25.361
<i>Don't forget,
bingo at 3:30 in the sunroom.</i>

08:25.363 --> 08:27.363
- Something wrong?
- No.

08:27.365 --> 08:30.568
That name don't sound familiar.
Can you describe her?

08:31.170 --> 08:34.904
Well, she lives here.
I think you'd do a better job than I can.

08:34.905 --> 08:37.075
She's probably in your files there.
Just check them.

08:39.143 --> 08:41.179
- I'll get Dr. Mitchell.
- All right.

08:47.418 --> 08:51.153
<i>Group meditation
on the main lawn in 15 minutes.</i>

08:51.155 --> 08:53.154
<i>There'll be group meditation
on the main lawn...</i>

08:53.156 --> 08:56.725
He's really busy right now.
If you don't mind having a seat.

08:56.727 --> 08:57.795
All right.

08:59.063 --> 09:01.996
Y'all do electric shock
treatment here?

09:01.998 --> 09:06.070
Not to visitors.
Well, that's good news.

09:14.111 --> 09:16.144
He's here to
see Barbara Van Poole.

09:30.261 --> 09:33.828
<i>Group meditation
on the main lawn in 15 minutes.</i>

09:33.830 --> 09:36.967
<i>Group meditation on the
main lawn in 15 minutes.</i>

09:56.153 --> 09:59.256
It's nice to see you again,
Mr. Carson Phillips.

10:00.823 --> 10:01.857
Excuse me?

10:04.026 --> 10:05.960
Oh, you don't
remember me.

10:05.962 --> 10:07.495
It was a long time ago.

10:07.497 --> 10:10.231
I was a freshman,
warming the bench.

10:10.233 --> 10:13.000
Still got splinters in my backside
from that. Playing football.

10:13.002 --> 10:15.971
You were out on the field.
You were a senior. You...

10:17.106 --> 10:20.308
Scoring.
Setting records.

10:20.310 --> 10:22.042
We went to a couple
of classes together.

10:22.044 --> 10:23.879
That is,
whenever you showed up.

10:25.114 --> 10:26.346
Miles.

10:26.348 --> 10:28.117
That your name? Miles?

10:28.850 --> 10:32.085
- Dr. Miles Mitchell.
- A lot of years ago. A lot of years ago.

10:32.087 --> 10:33.722
- True.
- Yeah.

10:35.524 --> 10:38.425
You really could have
been one of the greats.

10:38.427 --> 10:41.496
Mmm. Well,
you sure did well for yourself.

10:41.498 --> 10:44.798
This is a beautiful place you got here.
Thank you very much.

10:44.800 --> 10:48.834
We take pride in creating a serene
environment for our clients.

10:48.836 --> 10:52.272
We service all the
greater Galveston area.

10:52.274 --> 10:54.007
All over Texas.

10:54.009 --> 10:55.277
The entire nation, really.

10:56.512 --> 10:58.545
So, you're here to
see Miss Van Poole?

10:58.547 --> 10:59.781
Yes, I am.

11:01.082 --> 11:03.017
Right this way.
All right.

11:05.186 --> 11:08.888
Well then, how do you
know Miss Van Poole?

11:08.890 --> 11:11.891
Well, just a friend
of the family's.

11:11.893 --> 11:15.363
I came back to my hometown.
I'm just visiting.

11:15.997 --> 11:17.931
No problem, I trust.

11:17.933 --> 11:20.300
Hey, you're the doctor.
You tell me.

11:20.302 --> 11:22.304
No. No.
Of course not.

11:23.338 --> 11:25.571
It's just that she doesn't
get many visitors

11:25.573 --> 11:27.808
and she rarely sees the family.

11:28.409 --> 11:30.110
Well,
here I am visiting.

11:30.112 --> 11:32.346
Hmm.
Yeah.

11:32.348 --> 11:34.880
I don't like to
neglect a promise,

11:34.882 --> 11:37.550
so I told her
I'd go visit Barbara

11:37.552 --> 11:40.186
and make sure she's all right,
maybe even cheer her up a bit.

11:40.188 --> 11:43.358
Course. Course,
I understand completely.

11:44.425 --> 11:47.193
It's just that you can't
see Barbara right now.

11:47.195 --> 11:49.030
She's in a group
therapy session.

11:49.930 --> 11:53.233
- So, how long are you in town?
- Well, I'll wait.

11:54.302 --> 11:56.435
Well, the session
goes on all afternoon

11:56.437 --> 11:58.837
and we don't like to interrupt
them, you see.

11:58.839 --> 12:03.275
Of course, we do give them breaks and
such, but we need to keep them... focused.

12:03.277 --> 12:06.946
But I will call you when she's up and
around. Now, where are you staying?

12:06.948 --> 12:09.017
Well, why don't I just
come back this evening?

12:09.450 --> 12:11.517
She'll be exhausted,
poor thing.

12:11.519 --> 12:16.087
We do like to give the patients
time to reflect upon...

12:16.089 --> 12:18.393
Mm-hmm.
what the group has said.

12:19.860 --> 12:21.094
So...

12:21.429 --> 12:23.895
They didn't tell me about
this group therapy stuff.

12:23.897 --> 12:25.399
I'm curious about that.

12:26.366 --> 12:28.368
Miss Van Poole's
a very private person.

12:29.304 --> 12:31.404
On top of that, she...

12:31.406 --> 12:34.506
is considerably wealthy,
and she has this belief that...

12:34.508 --> 12:36.207
Everybody wants her money.

12:36.209 --> 12:38.310
Well, I can assure you
that ain't the case.

12:38.312 --> 12:39.544
So, why don't we do this?

12:39.546 --> 12:41.980
I'm staying at
the Lone Star Motel.

12:41.982 --> 12:45.383
Why don't you give me a call when
Barbara's ready, and I'll come back.

12:45.385 --> 12:49.154
In the meantime, I say,
thank you for your time

12:49.156 --> 12:51.425
and have a great day.

13:33.332 --> 13:36.066
<i>I felt the invisible
tug of my short hairs</i>

13:36.068 --> 13:38.035
<i>when I left
the good doctor,</i>

13:38.037 --> 13:40.206
<i>so I thought I'd follow
a different tug.</i>

- I assume you can still get bourbon here?
- Yes, sir.

14:31.356 --> 14:32.290
You got it.

14:37.262 --> 14:39.364

15:00.685 --> 15:05.154
For shit's sake, Slide.

15:05.156 --> 15:06.656
Let's go, <i>cabrón.</i>

15:06.658 --> 15:09.258
Only three kind of people
who wear sunglasses inside.

15:09.260 --> 15:12.162
Blind people, assholes
and blind assholes.

15:12.797 --> 15:16.033
Okay, I raise
200 dollars.

15:16.500 --> 15:19.571
Lorenzo, you spend
all your money on that suit?

15:19.771 --> 15:21.171
I like that suit.

15:22.272 --> 15:24.374
Oh, my God.

15:26.276 --> 15:29.043
Hey, Doc.
How you doing?

15:29.045 --> 15:31.348
I never thought I'd see
you around here again.

15:32.082 --> 15:33.548
Look at you.
You look like hell.

15:33.550 --> 15:35.383
Well, only you'd know.

15:35.385 --> 15:36.651
I like what you've
done to the place.

15:36.653 --> 15:40.187
Well, you know,
they demand, I supply.

15:40.189 --> 15:42.594
They get screwed,
I get rich.

15:43.160 --> 15:45.527
Not very scientific,
but it works every time.

15:45.529 --> 15:49.498
- Bing, you remember our hometown hero.
- Oh, come on now!

15:49.500 --> 15:50.601
Bing Walsh?

15:51.434 --> 15:52.834
It's Chief Walsh now.

15:52.836 --> 15:56.104
Oh! Chief of police.
Oh, man. Only in Texas.

15:57.508 --> 16:00.276
Don't do this! Don't do this!

16:02.445 --> 16:05.747
- I thought I saw a ghost, man.
- You did see a ghost.

16:05.749 --> 16:09.620
Deal him in, Mary Sue.
His credit's good around here.

16:10.286 --> 16:11.588
His credit is good.

16:17.594 --> 16:20.462
I guess you're up
for a nice, friendly game?

16:20.464 --> 16:22.231
All right. Well, twist my arm.

16:24.133 --> 16:27.803
- Can we play some goddamn cards?
- Hold your horses there, slick.

16:29.339 --> 16:31.575
This is Lorenzo Rodriguez.
He's a...

16:32.609 --> 16:33.842
entrepreneur.

16:33.844 --> 16:35.442
Isn't that what
you call yourself?

16:35.444 --> 16:37.380
You know what we call him?
El Guano.

16:37.880 --> 16:42.385
'Cause he used to clean out
the bedpans at the sanitarium.

16:42.886 --> 16:44.120
Is that right?

16:45.254 --> 16:46.754
You're the man
I need to talk to.

16:46.756 --> 16:49.690
- Hey, Daddy.
- Hi, angel. How much you need?

16:49.692 --> 16:51.561
What? Just your
love and affection.

16:52.193 --> 16:55.429
Carson, this is my daughter, Rose.
She owns this joint.

16:55.431 --> 16:57.631
Oh. It's impressive.
Thank you.

16:57.633 --> 17:00.133
- And this is...
- Oh, I know who he is.

17:00.135 --> 17:02.903
'Cause I watch you
every week on TV.

17:02.905 --> 17:04.671
How's it feel to have
all your records broken?

17:04.673 --> 17:06.608
Oh, man,
that's what they're made for.

17:07.310 --> 17:09.476
Coach said you used to be the
best quarterback he ever saw.

17:09.478 --> 17:11.477
Well, I bet he ain't
saying that no more.

17:11.479 --> 17:12.813
You got that right.

17:12.815 --> 17:14.580
What a screwup, huh?

17:14.583 --> 17:16.915
Oh? We're insulting now?

17:16.917 --> 17:19.619
I mean, betting on your own
games, shaving points.

17:19.622 --> 17:22.890
Man, you had the world by the balls,
and you just threw it all away.

17:22.892 --> 17:24.557
How's that make you feel?

17:24.559 --> 17:26.595
I don't know.
Maybe one day you'll tell me.

17:27.395 --> 17:29.565
That's not likely.
I don't have a price, old man.

17:30.833 --> 17:33.368
- Everybody's got a price.
- So much talk.

17:34.235 --> 17:36.336
Yeah. I'm way down here.

17:36.338 --> 17:38.540
Happy, I'll see you later
in my office.

17:39.341 --> 17:40.542
See you around, Carson.

17:42.377 --> 17:43.877
All right, slick,

17:43.879 --> 17:46.212
let's see what you learned
in the big city.

17:46.214 --> 17:47.682
- All right.
- Ante up, gentlemen.

18:06.301 --> 18:09.404
Fuck. Are you kidding me?
Fuck it.

18:21.382 --> 18:23.582
<i>So there I was,
sitting at a poker table,</i>

18:23.584 --> 18:26.318
<i>surrounded by the people
I grew up with.</i>

18:26.320 --> 18:29.354
<i>And even though I'd been
gone for over 20 years,</i>

18:29.356 --> 18:30.790
<i>I couldn't believe how easily</i>

18:30.792 --> 18:33.862
<i>I slipped back into the pace
and rhythm of my past.</i>

18:35.429 --> 18:38.997
<i>There was Bing Walsh,
who I played football with.</i>

18:38.999 --> 18:42.601
<i>I was certain the next big case
he saw would be his first.</i>

18:42.603 --> 18:43.637
I'm done.

18:48.375 --> 18:50.410
- I'm all in.
- He's all in.

18:52.012 --> 18:55.247
<i>Then there was
Slide, the original hippy.</i>

18:55.249 --> 18:57.584
<i>He probably dropped more acid
than Timothy Leary.</i>

18:58.018 --> 19:00.253
Sorry, Doc. I'm outta here.

19:03.857 --> 19:06.525
- All in.
- <i>Lastly, there was Doc.</i>

19:06.527 --> 19:08.794
<i>He went from being
a small-town bookie</i>

19:08.796 --> 19:11.297
<i>to one of the biggest
power brokers in the state.</i>

19:12.498 --> 19:15.332
- <i>That in itself had to be respected...</i>
- <i>Chinga!</i>

19:15.334 --> 19:19.405
<i>considering he was a black man...
in Texas.</i>

19:25.278 --> 19:27.213
Only the big dogs left.

19:30.651 --> 19:32.452
- Possible straight.
- Check.

19:32.986 --> 19:35.955
You know me, Doc.
All or nothing.

19:37.790 --> 19:42.495
That line of thinking tends to
lead more towards nothing...

19:43.663 --> 19:45.431
than something.

19:45.865 --> 19:46.866
Call.

19:47.600 --> 19:49.802
We live in a world
that's full of risk.

19:51.436 --> 19:52.571
That makes a straight.

19:57.543 --> 19:58.578
I don't.

19:59.479 --> 20:01.714
Doc wins.
Congratulations.

20:03.015 --> 20:04.614
Full house beats a straight.

20:04.616 --> 20:06.252
I never lose, Carson.

20:08.054 --> 20:11.088
- Mary Sue, cash those chips in for me.
- Yes, sir.

20:11.090 --> 20:13.558
Let's take a break. I'll buy you a drink.
Bourbon, isn't it?

20:13.960 --> 20:14.960
Yep.

20:19.599 --> 20:21.633
Really sorry
to hear about Marie.

20:26.037 --> 20:27.506
Been 12 years now.

20:30.342 --> 20:32.277
Fucking cancer.
Mmm.

20:33.378 --> 20:35.480
Nearly half the town
got sick with it.

20:38.049 --> 20:39.551
You seen Jayne yet?

20:40.118 --> 20:42.052
No. No.

20:42.054 --> 20:44.523
Oh, hell, I wouldn't know
what to say to her.

20:45.724 --> 20:47.357
She's a widow now.

20:47.359 --> 20:50.061
Got a beautiful daughter, Becky.

20:51.062 --> 20:53.663
- Married to that idiot.
- I still got guys behind me.

20:57.135 --> 20:59.604
- Son of a bitch!
- Oh, hell, here we go.

21:02.807 --> 21:04.740
- Chill out, man.
- Hey, hey, Happy.

21:04.742 --> 21:05.911
Now, all right!

21:06.778 --> 21:09.411
The hell's the matter with you?

21:09.413 --> 21:12.982
Starting a fistfight on the night before
a big game. Have you lost your mind?

21:12.984 --> 21:14.351
Go home to your wife.

21:15.719 --> 21:18.454
Look. You take a swing at
me and I can assure you,

21:18.456 --> 21:19.889
you'll lose your spot
for the draft.

21:19.891 --> 21:20.792
You understand?

21:21.692 --> 21:22.726
Settle down.

21:24.895 --> 21:25.930
Go home, son.

22:32.729 --> 22:33.696
I remember you.

22:35.932 --> 22:37.399
Where's your kitty cat?

22:37.767 --> 22:40.435
Well, he prefers LA.

22:40.971 --> 22:42.973
The sun, the women.

22:44.007 --> 22:45.742
Mr. Gregory wants
to speak to you.

22:47.744 --> 22:48.811
I see that.

22:50.646 --> 22:51.711
Hmm.

22:51.713 --> 22:52.614
Turn the fuck around!

22:52.949 --> 22:53.950
Huh?

23:04.593 --> 23:06.596
You really need to
get better help.

23:07.597 --> 23:09.163
Where is she, Mr. Phillips?

23:09.165 --> 23:11.466
I have no idea.

23:12.235 --> 23:14.701
I want her back.
Now look,

23:14.703 --> 23:18.572
I found her, I brought her home to
you, and you paid me for that.

23:18.574 --> 23:20.808
Come on, she was only
home for a few hours,

23:20.810 --> 23:23.110
she packed some things,
and she was off again.

23:23.112 --> 23:26.012
- And that is not my problem!
- Oh, but it is.

23:26.014 --> 23:29.116
You were seen at the airport with
her, putting her on a plane.

23:29.118 --> 23:31.551
Now, I want you to go get
her and bring her home.

23:31.553 --> 23:33.853
Even if I knew where she was,
and I don't,

23:33.855 --> 23:37.023
do you think that I would bring her
to you knowing what you did to her?

23:37.025 --> 23:38.591
What did she say to you?

23:38.593 --> 23:41.830
I mean, what? What?
That I abused her?

23:44.032 --> 23:46.900
That she just needed
a safe place?

23:46.902 --> 23:50.138
She just once wanted to sleep and
not have to leave the light on?

23:52.240 --> 23:54.076
I thought you were smart.

23:56.745 --> 23:58.812
You're a sucker.

23:58.814 --> 24:01.749
Sucker for a pretty girl
and a sob story.

24:02.717 --> 24:04.653
I'd look into that
if I were you.

24:07.289 --> 24:08.757
Watch your back, Carson.

24:10.192 --> 24:12.158
- Come on, get up!
- <i>He was right.</i>

24:12.160 --> 24:16.095
<i>His daughter had spun quite a tale
to get me to help her get away.</i>

24:16.097 --> 24:19.766
<i>And he was smart enough to know
that I was dumb enough</i>

24:19.768 --> 24:21.234
<i>to give her the money.</i>

24:21.236 --> 24:25.771
<i>Once again,
a beautiful woman with a sob story.</i>

24:25.773 --> 24:27.706
<i>You figure I'd have
learned my lesson by now.</i>

24:27.708 --> 24:29.878
<i>Not a chance.</i>

24:32.613 --> 24:34.048
Mr. Phillips.

24:35.082 --> 24:37.116
I got tired of waiting.

24:37.118 --> 24:39.018
You never called.

24:39.020 --> 24:40.989
You are not a gentleman.

24:41.922 --> 24:45.958
- How's Barbara?
- Barbara is fine. She's resting.

24:45.960 --> 24:47.359
It's a game day.

24:47.361 --> 24:49.828
I got a little bit
carried away with my affairs,

24:49.830 --> 24:51.696
and I'm sorry I did not call.
I forgot.

24:51.698 --> 24:54.600
Well, I'm here now,
so you don't have to call.

24:54.602 --> 24:56.201
She doesn't want to see anybody.

24:56.203 --> 25:00.039
Now look, it'll only
take a minute, and...

25:00.041 --> 25:02.341
her family is concerned.

25:02.343 --> 25:06.912
I feel like we have had this
conversation already, Mr. Phillips.

25:06.914 --> 25:09.081
We both know
what the family wants.

25:09.083 --> 25:12.917
I'm sorry, as her doctor, I cannot
recommend that she sees a stranger.

25:12.919 --> 25:19.191
And I'm even more sorry that you
came all this way for nothing.

25:19.193 --> 25:23.297
You know, the whole time that I was
sitting here, that phone didn't ring once.

25:24.998 --> 25:26.733
How do you stay in business?

25:29.804 --> 25:31.236
<i>Good morning, everyone.</i>

25:31.238 --> 25:34.138
<i>Today's lunch will feature
meat loaf and gravy.</i>

25:34.140 --> 25:37.375
<i>Today's lunch will feature
meat loaf and gravy.</i>

25:37.377 --> 25:40.180
You just hold me. You'll be fine.

26:03.902 --> 26:05.305
We have some new clients.

26:06.039 --> 26:09.040
- Can you handle it?
- I don't have...

26:09.042 --> 26:11.042
The kid wants more.
What should we do?

26:11.044 --> 26:13.311
You need to step up and take care
of that little problem of ours.

26:13.313 --> 26:16.279
- Go, go, go.
- Okay. <i>Adios.</i>

26:16.281 --> 26:17.817
I'll take care of it.

27:25.249 --> 27:28.384
<i>I found her file.
It was empty.</i>

27:28.386 --> 27:31.121
<i>No progress reports.
No med list.</i>

27:31.123 --> 27:35.257
<i>Just my client's address
and a few paid statements.</i>

27:35.259 --> 27:37.428
<i>Most of his patients
had passed on.</i>

27:40.865 --> 27:43.435
<i>It seemed like the good
doctor was also taking bets.</i>

27:44.936 --> 27:46.335
<i>Interestingly though,</i>

27:46.337 --> 27:48.839
<i>all the bets were
for us to lose.</i>

28:44.027 --> 28:45.195
You can sit down
right here.

28:47.197 --> 28:49.397
Such a pretty day.
You can listen to the game outside.

28:49.399 --> 28:51.232
<i>It's ball
day here in sunny Galveston,</i>

28:51.234 --> 28:53.469
<i>where Happy Chandler hopes to
lead his team to a victory...</i>

28:53.471 --> 28:56.871
We're gonna go inside. You let us
know if you need anything, all right?

28:56.873 --> 29:00.310
<i>Happy leads the Conference
in TD passes and his electrifying...</i>

29:38.380 --> 29:39.548
Did you come from...

29:40.916 --> 29:41.917
up there?

29:42.385 --> 29:44.053
Yes, I did.

29:44.953 --> 29:46.455
Oh, goodness.

29:48.090 --> 29:49.224
Here, let me help you.

29:50.192 --> 29:51.959
All right. Thank you.

29:54.997 --> 29:57.130
Oh!
Are you okay?

29:57.132 --> 29:59.132
Yeah.
A bit wobbly.

29:59.134 --> 30:02.268
You wouldn't know a Barbara Van
Poole, would you?

30:02.270 --> 30:05.339
Yes. But I've not seen
her for a long time.

30:05.341 --> 30:07.974
Any idea where
she might be?

30:07.976 --> 30:10.444
No. People just disappear here.

30:10.446 --> 30:12.612
This is a bad place.

30:12.614 --> 30:15.548
<i>As we approach
halftime, New Mexico still leads</i>

30:15.550 --> 30:18.452
<i>even after that beautiful TD
pass from Happy Chandler...</i>

30:31.165 --> 30:33.502
What is all the racket out here...
Oh!

30:34.402 --> 30:35.503
Hi, Mr. Phillips.

30:36.204 --> 30:39.205
I'm sorry.
Would you...

30:39.207 --> 30:41.475
Would you mind getting
me this film developed?

30:41.477 --> 30:42.511
Oh, sure.

30:43.077 --> 30:44.345
What the hell
happened to you?

30:45.513 --> 30:46.645
I fell.

30:46.647 --> 30:48.247
That's fresh dirt.

30:48.249 --> 30:50.083
I can get that cleaned up
for you, if you want.

30:51.051 --> 30:52.286
All right.
That'd be nice.

30:53.254 --> 30:55.254
Here. Thank you.
I appreciate it much.

30:55.256 --> 30:56.555
Sure.
How's the game going?

30:56.557 --> 30:58.424
Happy's messing it all up.

30:58.426 --> 31:01.396
We're behind by a touchdown,
but we're favored by 11.

31:02.597 --> 31:05.331
Well, it's still early.

31:05.333 --> 31:07.233
<i>Except for
that one breathtaking run,</i>

31:07.235 --> 31:10.034
<i>a terrible game so far
for Happy Chandler.</i>

31:10.036 --> 31:11.604
<i>Abysmal passing by Chandler.</i>

31:11.606 --> 31:13.972
- <i>Five interceptions.</i>
- They're gone, Mr. Phillips.

31:13.974 --> 31:15.442
<i>Five of 18 on the day...</i>

31:16.511 --> 31:18.079
They said they'd be back.

31:18.346 --> 31:19.712
Who?

31:19.714 --> 31:22.417
Four guys in a black Dodge,
California plates.

31:23.484 --> 31:24.551
They friends of yours?

31:26.052 --> 31:28.322
Well, not exactly.

31:29.424 --> 31:33.191
Would you mind keeping
an eye on them for me?

31:33.193 --> 31:37.531
They gave me a
hundred to keep an eye on you!

31:38.998 --> 31:42.002
No. No need.
I took their money, but...

31:42.437 --> 31:44.269
I don't see so good.

31:44.271 --> 31:47.105
<i>Third interception
today for Happy Chandler.</i>

31:47.107 --> 31:51.241
<i>Oh, no. Happy is still down.
He does not seem to be moving.</i>

31:51.243 --> 31:55.280
<i>The trainer is on the field,
and he's waving for the stretcher.</i>

31:55.282 --> 31:59.784
<i>This does not look good.
Chandler being carted off the field.</i>

31:59.786 --> 32:03.657
<i>The crowd has gone completely quiet.
They are stunned.</i>

32:16.603 --> 32:19.639
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Coming through.

32:20.707 --> 32:23.040
Stay back. Stay back.
That's my husband.

32:23.042 --> 32:25.509
- Stay back.
- That's my husband!

32:25.511 --> 32:27.146
That's my husband!

32:46.398 --> 32:47.633
Please stand aside.

32:56.709 --> 32:58.575
<i>I didn't know what to say.</i>

32:58.577 --> 33:02.211
<i>After all these years,
it had to be perfect.</i>

33:02.213 --> 33:03.780
<i>And let's face it,</i>

33:03.782 --> 33:07.152
<i>the situation wasn't exactly
conducive to small talk.</i>

33:09.588 --> 33:12.288
<i>I thought about Jayne.</i>

33:12.290 --> 33:16.529
<i>I thought about Happy lying on a
slab instead of next to his wife.</i>

33:17.229 --> 33:20.531
<i>I thought about the missing
Barbara Van Poole</i>

33:20.533 --> 33:22.467
<i>and the mysterious doctor.</i>

33:23.334 --> 33:26.337
<i>Most importantly,
I thought about having a drink...</i>

33:27.205 --> 33:28.639
<i>and not a small one.</i>

33:40.184 --> 33:41.487
- Yeah.
- <i>Carson?</i>

33:42.220 --> 33:43.221
<i>It's Jayne.</i>

33:44.556 --> 33:47.725
<i>Can you come up to the house?
I'd like to talk.</i>

34:07.245 --> 34:10.413
<i>Before yesterday,
I hadn't seen her in 20 years.</i>

34:10.415 --> 34:13.516
<i>I had pretty much convinced
myself that I was over her.</i>

34:14.451 --> 34:16.521
<i>But that's not the first time
I've been wrong.</i>

34:17.655 --> 34:19.290
How you doing, sir?
Come inside.

34:21.190 --> 34:23.560
How are you?
I'm doing good. Follow me.

34:26.196 --> 34:27.696
Come sit right here.

34:27.697 --> 34:29.799
Thank you.
No problem.

34:29.801 --> 34:32.268
She'll be right with you shortly.
All right.

34:57.294 --> 34:58.562
Hello, Carson.

35:00.530 --> 35:01.598
Hello, Jayne.

35:04.401 --> 35:05.769
Would you like a drink?

35:06.937 --> 35:08.905
Well, it's 10:30 in the morning.

35:09.906 --> 35:11.173
The usual?

35:12.709 --> 35:13.877
You did well.

35:15.544 --> 35:16.613
Not really.

35:18.582 --> 35:20.884
Well, it looks like you
got everything you need.

35:25.588 --> 35:27.523
Looks can be deceiving, Carson.

35:33.764 --> 35:35.498
So, what happened
with Charlie?

35:36.832 --> 35:37.867
He died.

35:38.834 --> 35:40.869
Had a heart attack right
there in the garden.

35:40.871 --> 35:42.405
I'm sorry.

35:44.740 --> 35:46.409
There's no free lunches.

35:47.510 --> 35:49.244
He wanted it all.
Turns out...

35:50.413 --> 35:53.614
having everything was a
little too much for him.

35:53.616 --> 35:55.851
You mind my asking
what he did for work?

35:56.552 --> 35:57.653
He was in oil.

35:58.788 --> 36:00.923
Oh, that's simple.

36:01.691 --> 36:02.925
It wasn't.

36:03.625 --> 36:04.727
And it isn't.

36:05.895 --> 36:09.632
Like everything too good to be
true, it comes at a price.

36:13.568 --> 36:17.339
Enough about me.
How about you? You doing well?

36:20.843 --> 36:22.442
Well, I get by.

36:22.444 --> 36:23.745
Well, we have that in common.

36:28.384 --> 36:29.418
I...

36:30.486 --> 36:32.652
I'd like to hire you.

36:32.654 --> 36:35.356
I mean, that's what you do now, right?
You're a private investigator?

36:35.857 --> 36:37.826
Yeah, that's what I do.

36:40.863 --> 36:43.696
I'm gonna need
all the help I can get.

36:43.698 --> 36:46.701
It's still a small town and people
have nothing to do but talk.

36:47.435 --> 36:48.735
Talk about what?

36:48.737 --> 36:51.637
Oh, come on. How many
22-year-old athletes

36:51.639 --> 36:53.539
do you see convulsing
on the football field?

36:53.541 --> 36:55.910
Well, he got
hit pretty hard.

36:56.778 --> 36:58.878
And that happens.

36:58.880 --> 37:01.683
Yeah, well,
I've already heard rumors.

37:02.817 --> 37:05.420
They don't think
this was football related.

37:06.488 --> 37:08.554
Sheriff Walsh
is an idiot.

37:08.556 --> 37:10.692
He'll want a quick
and clean answer.

37:12.593 --> 37:16.829
We both know his...
stupidity is limitless.

37:16.831 --> 37:18.967
Well, how'd he get to be
sheriff, anyway?

37:20.668 --> 37:21.970
That very reason.

37:28.109 --> 37:29.611
It's a bad place, Carson.

37:31.578 --> 37:33.614
Far worse than you can imagine.

37:35.916 --> 37:38.819
Doc owns everything
and everybody.

37:42.556 --> 37:44.858
For years,
I hated you for leaving.

37:47.427 --> 37:49.530
Over time, I came
to understand that...

37:50.496 --> 37:53.400
escaping this place was the
smartest thing you could do.

38:06.880 --> 38:10.916
Happy was running around
town with that slut, Rose.

38:10.918 --> 38:12.683
My daughter's a scorned wife.

38:12.685 --> 38:14.485
This is the first place
they'll come looking.

38:14.487 --> 38:16.122
All right.

38:16.124 --> 38:18.992
Why don't we just slow down,
just take one step at a time?

38:24.630 --> 38:27.698
Becky hasn't had it easy
these past few years.

38:27.700 --> 38:28.834
All right.

38:28.836 --> 38:30.604
After Charlie died,
I...

38:32.772 --> 38:35.575
I admitted myself to
Pleasant Meadows for a while.

38:36.776 --> 38:38.978
I've been there, Jayne.
That ain't your style.

38:39.779 --> 38:41.612
You're as tough as nails.

38:41.614 --> 38:43.649
Those nails got rusty,
Carson.

38:45.451 --> 38:47.985
Maybe you can help me
with something.

38:47.987 --> 38:51.487
About the woman in the sanitarium?
Barbara Van Poole?

38:51.489 --> 38:54.825
I told you. There's no
secrets in this town.

38:54.827 --> 38:56.627
Did you ever meet her
when you were there?

38:56.629 --> 38:57.563
Sure, I did.

38:58.531 --> 38:59.832
That was a while ago.

39:01.133 --> 39:04.037
Why is it that I'm having such a
hard time getting ahold of her?

39:04.637 --> 39:06.171
I don't know.

39:06.173 --> 39:08.741
When I left, I put all my
energy into raising Becky.

39:09.675 --> 39:12.111
Goddamn it, she had to fall in
love with a football player!

39:14.080 --> 39:15.580
That sound familiar?

39:21.988 --> 39:23.855
We were too young, Carson.

39:25.757 --> 39:26.858
Just like them.

39:38.837 --> 39:42.574
Emile will take care of your first
payment, and he will see you out.

39:44.976 --> 39:46.044
Yes, ma'am.

39:47.712 --> 39:50.614
Oh... shit.

39:54.853 --> 39:58.755
<i>I reached out to my
client in LA to give her an update,</i>

39:58.757 --> 40:01.092
<i>but oddly, her number
had been disconnected.</i>

40:01.725 --> 40:03.725
<i>I couldn't say no to Jayne,</i>

40:03.727 --> 40:06.765
<i>so I decided my first questions
would be for the coroner,</i>

40:07.098 --> 40:10.902
<i>who for some reason chose not
to return any of my calls.</i>

40:11.770 --> 40:13.036
Hot dog, buddy.

40:13.038 --> 40:14.939
I have been looking for you
all morning.

40:15.673 --> 40:18.007
And who are you?
I'm Carson Phillips.

40:18.009 --> 40:21.778
- Oh, yeah. I've been rather busy.
- I can see that.

40:21.780 --> 40:23.745
My treat.
You don't have to do that.

40:23.747 --> 40:25.849
I need some information
about Happy Chandler.

40:27.651 --> 40:28.952
He's dead.

40:28.954 --> 40:30.855
I need a little more
information than that.

40:31.923 --> 40:33.557
It's not about the money.

40:33.891 --> 40:35.526
Now, will you please stop?

40:40.899 --> 40:44.135
- He took a big shot.
- But was it the hit that killed him?

40:44.935 --> 40:46.170
The hit was vicious.

40:47.104 --> 40:51.041
It broke his collar bone,
fractured his femur...

40:52.643 --> 40:54.778
But?
But...

40:56.613 --> 41:00.648
we found extremely
high levels of ephedrine

41:00.650 --> 41:04.886
and some yet to be determined
chemical substance in his blood.

41:04.888 --> 41:06.922
Now what exactly
does that mean?

41:06.924 --> 41:11.026
Well, some of these athletes
use it as a stimulant.

41:11.028 --> 41:15.797
But we've sent it to the lab
in Dallas for a full analysis.

41:15.799 --> 41:18.702
Should have the results
back in a few days.

41:19.069 --> 41:22.072
Can I count on you when
that does come through?

41:23.040 --> 41:24.108
Absolutely.

41:54.637 --> 41:56.239
Jaynie.
Doc.

42:00.642 --> 42:03.813
You get on wonderful.
Well, thank you. So do you.

42:04.781 --> 42:07.915
How about a nice glass of
rosé from my private stock?

42:07.917 --> 42:11.285
Sounds great.
Your place is so lovely, as always.

42:11.287 --> 42:15.291
Not bad for a poor
kid from West Texas, huh?

42:40.817 --> 42:42.951
You're here about your
daughter, aren't you?

42:47.022 --> 42:49.055
And you think
I can help.

42:49.057 --> 42:52.892
Doc, you and I both know she had
nothing to do with Happy's death.

42:52.894 --> 42:54.727
Happy's murder.

42:54.729 --> 42:56.229
Fine, murder.

42:56.231 --> 42:58.398
It's bad enough
she's a widow at this age.

42:58.400 --> 43:00.268
Now she's
the number one suspect?

43:01.902 --> 43:04.240
You have to admit,
it doesn't look good.

43:06.007 --> 43:09.311
You could call off Sheriff
Walsh if you wanted to.

43:11.745 --> 43:14.980
You flatter me if you think
I have that kind of influence.

43:14.982 --> 43:16.852
Oh, please, Doc.

43:17.152 --> 43:19.687
You could affect the tides
if you wanted to.

43:23.091 --> 43:24.091
All right.

43:24.959 --> 43:27.061
Let's say
I do call Walsh...

43:28.930 --> 43:30.764
get him to do
what you want.

43:31.932 --> 43:33.067
What do I get?

43:33.968 --> 43:35.102
What do you have in mind?

43:36.837 --> 43:39.039
Well, you mentioned
the tides.

43:39.975 --> 43:42.375
I'm interested
in what's offshore.

43:42.377 --> 43:43.844
I bet you are.

43:46.046 --> 43:48.916
Who do you think kept the
State off your late husband?

43:50.184 --> 43:53.255
All those toxicity reports.

43:55.756 --> 43:58.192
He paid for some of this.

43:59.793 --> 44:00.928
So you see...

44:02.263 --> 44:04.299
I've been helping you all along.

44:05.099 --> 44:06.133
How much?

44:07.034 --> 44:08.235
I'll be your partner.

44:09.103 --> 44:10.905
Forty-nine percent.

44:11.372 --> 44:12.906
For you, of course.

44:16.977 --> 44:18.979
My attorney will be in touch.

44:21.315 --> 44:22.349
Good.

44:24.318 --> 44:26.019
Oh, and one other thing.

44:27.320 --> 44:28.355
Your...

44:29.823 --> 44:32.293
old paramour, Carson...

44:35.061 --> 44:36.396
I know you hired him.

44:38.097 --> 44:40.067
But you have to
call him off now.

44:41.135 --> 44:43.437
Get him to stop snooping around.

44:44.871 --> 44:48.274
He could undo a lot of
business just by making noise.

44:49.275 --> 44:51.044
And what are
you suggesting?

44:52.279 --> 44:54.111
Well...

44:54.113 --> 44:57.315
you can convince him
in ways that I can't.

44:59.252 --> 45:01.054
Now who's flattering who?

45:02.422 --> 45:03.890
I'll do my best.

45:05.526 --> 45:06.759
If you don't...

45:09.095 --> 45:10.896
I'll have to talk to him.

45:17.904 --> 45:19.339
Hey, Slide, how you doing?

45:20.106 --> 45:22.939
Umm, honestly,
not too good.

45:22.941 --> 45:24.874
- Can I get you a drink?
- Yeah. Bourbon.

45:24.876 --> 45:26.178
Neat or on the rocks?
Neat.

45:26.912 --> 45:27.914
Why is that?

45:28.915 --> 45:30.014
Why?

45:30.016 --> 45:32.048
This thing with Happy, man.

45:32.050 --> 45:35.519
- It's heavy. It's really heavy.
- Oh, is that so?

45:35.521 --> 45:36.488
Far out.

45:37.422 --> 45:39.991
You know everything that's
happening around here.

45:39.993 --> 45:41.325
Did Happy do drugs?

45:41.327 --> 45:44.027
Happy's drug was Rose.

45:44.029 --> 45:46.930
Couldn't get enough
of that sweet ass.

45:46.932 --> 45:48.365
Did Becky know about Rose?

45:48.367 --> 45:50.102
Hell, yeah.
We all knew.

45:52.338 --> 45:53.872
How'd you do
on the game?

45:55.508 --> 45:59.244
I bet a little and I lose a little.
You know?

46:00.012 --> 46:01.278
How'd Mitchell do?

46:01.280 --> 46:03.313
Oh, shit. Mitchell?

46:03.315 --> 46:05.817
He owes Doc
a shitload of money.

46:06.351 --> 46:09.986
Oh? Got so bad,
he had to let Lorenzo go.

46:09.988 --> 46:12.023
Oh. How'd Lorenzo do?

46:12.424 --> 46:15.959
He lost his ass.

46:15.961 --> 46:19.496
You know, for a guy
who used to change bedpans,

46:19.498 --> 46:21.366
he's got some
pretty nice threads.

46:21.999 --> 46:25.502
You know what, I think
he's dealing some dope.

46:25.504 --> 46:29.105
No harm in dealing
a little dope, is there?

46:29.107 --> 46:31.508
Now, would Happy
go to him to get drugs?

46:31.510 --> 46:33.378
Lorenzo? Uhh...

46:34.045 --> 46:36.111
Nah, he would
go to Mitchell.

46:36.113 --> 46:38.249
After all, he's a doctor,
isn't he?

46:41.186 --> 46:44.121
Now, why are you asking me
all these questions?

46:45.089 --> 46:47.158
Hell, you know me.
I'm just curious.

46:52.364 --> 46:55.230
<i>I didn't like the
look of the guy at the bar,</i>

46:55.232 --> 46:58.502
<i>so I decided to wait outside
to see if he followed me.</i>

47:00.538 --> 47:02.540
<i>Instead, I saw Lorenzo.</i>

47:04.175 --> 47:06.442
<i>♪ As I'm getting older ♪</i>

47:36.539 --> 47:39.307

47:41.579 --> 47:43.445
<i>Skipping the science lesson,</i>

47:43.447 --> 47:47.283
<i>he said that it was tainted
speed that had killed Happy.</i>

47:48.518 --> 47:51.019
Thought you said
you were just passing through.

47:53.990 --> 47:55.191
Well, that's changed.

47:56.092 --> 47:58.061
Have you been hired
by Jayne Hunt?

47:59.129 --> 48:00.728
Hired to do what?

48:00.730 --> 48:03.230
Oh, come on. Protect Becky.

48:03.232 --> 48:06.300
Happy's been blatantly
cheating on her all over town.

48:06.302 --> 48:08.302
It seems like
it's open-shut to me.

48:08.304 --> 48:11.606
How do you know it's not one of
those endless Texas bluebonnets

48:11.608 --> 48:13.441
that he was deflowering,

48:13.443 --> 48:15.912
promising he would leave his
wife for them and didn't?

48:16.312 --> 48:17.414
I don't buy it.

48:17.614 --> 48:19.747
Or maybe more likely,

48:19.749 --> 48:22.350
it's a bunch of people getting rich
off of him messing up on the field.

48:22.352 --> 48:24.184
What are you getting at?

48:24.186 --> 48:28.156
Maybe they made him the same
deal they made me years ago.

48:28.158 --> 48:30.660
But they didn't want him dead,
they just wanted him to mess up.

48:32.495 --> 48:34.662
You know what I think?

48:34.664 --> 48:38.200
I think all that LA sunshine
has done made you a bit loopy.

48:40.136 --> 48:41.436
I think
it's cleared my head up.

48:55.652 --> 48:56.685
Light me.

49:08.230 --> 49:09.298
Wanna do a shot?

49:10.532 --> 49:11.966
All right.

49:13.234 --> 49:14.268
Two.

49:21.142 --> 49:22.176
To Happy.

49:23.645 --> 49:25.346
He really was a great guy.

49:33.254 --> 49:36.157
Is that your
mourning dress?

49:38.626 --> 49:40.195
It's black, isn't it?

49:41.296 --> 49:42.564
What there is of it.

49:45.834 --> 49:49.270
Did you get jealous every time
he went home with his wife?

49:50.371 --> 49:52.106
You wanna know
if I killed him?

49:54.175 --> 49:55.343
I'd like to know that.

49:59.680 --> 50:01.516
Did Happy do drugs?

50:03.083 --> 50:04.720
Please, no more questions.

50:05.821 --> 50:08.721
You were a football player.
I like football players.

50:08.723 --> 50:10.658
But not so much
when they talk.

50:22.637 --> 50:25.169
You like to watch?
Huh?

50:25.171 --> 50:27.273
Do you like to watch?
Excuse me?

50:27.275 --> 50:28.643
People.
People.

50:30.344 --> 50:32.613
Yeah, I guess I do.
Kind of a habit.

50:34.715 --> 50:35.750
Those boys...

50:39.220 --> 50:41.353
Always whispering.

50:41.355 --> 50:44.257
Being secretive,
like we don't know what's really going on.

50:45.425 --> 50:49.227
Well, I have noticed
that since I've been gone

50:49.229 --> 50:52.698
things have gotten a
little bit more organized.

50:52.700 --> 50:55.535
- Oh, yeah. Daddy's got the whole state wired.
- Rose.

50:58.738 --> 51:02.274
I'd like to have a moment
with my friend here, angel.

51:05.278 --> 51:06.313
Yes, Daddy.

51:18.625 --> 51:20.493
Let's you and me take a ride.

51:22.361 --> 51:23.395
All right.

51:34.206 --> 51:35.240
Let's go.

51:58.697 --> 52:01.332
Are we going anywhere
in particular?

52:05.304 --> 52:07.740
<i>You're here looking
for that Van Poole woman.</i>

52:08.574 --> 52:10.307
Yup, that's right.

52:10.309 --> 52:13.444
I
can tell you where she is.

52:14.713 --> 52:16.515
Well, that would be nice.

52:18.317 --> 52:19.685
But if I do that...

52:21.587 --> 52:22.821
I want you
to go home.

52:25.657 --> 52:27.726
I'll give you a healthy
going away present.

52:30.362 --> 52:32.330
Carson,
you're a smart guy.

52:33.531 --> 52:37.333
I'm sure you've put most of
the pieces together already.

52:37.335 --> 52:40.572
I just can't have anybody
poking around in my business.

52:41.507 --> 52:43.006
Honestly, Doc,

52:43.008 --> 52:45.309
I ain't interested
in your business.

52:48.746 --> 52:52.785
I know Jayne Hunt hired you
to keep her daughter safe.

52:57.321 --> 53:00.725
And I know you've been sniffing
around Pleasant Meadows.

53:02.459 --> 53:04.629
That's just not gonna
work out for you.

53:06.031 --> 53:07.265
Then, all right.

53:08.399 --> 53:10.368
Where is Barbara Van Poole?

53:11.836 --> 53:12.937
She's dead.

53:14.906 --> 53:17.475
She's as dead
as Julius Caesar.

53:18.876 --> 53:21.479
And I'm sure
she's not the only one.

53:22.880 --> 53:26.650
Rich but crazy family members that
nobody ever gave a fuck about.

53:28.886 --> 53:30.720
Look,

53:30.722 --> 53:34.723
you go back to Los Angeles with
a police report from Walsh.

53:34.725 --> 53:38.660
I'll have the coroner give you
a legitimate death certificate

53:38.662 --> 53:40.965
and a nice will for her kin.

53:43.067 --> 53:45.569
It's not a bad deal, Carson.

53:46.770 --> 53:47.804
Walk away.

53:54.578 --> 53:55.746
Oh, man.

53:57.981 --> 53:59.816
I can't.

54:00.817 --> 54:03.919
I screwed Jayne over
once before,

54:03.921 --> 54:06.690
and I just can't live with
myself if I do it again.

54:17.567 --> 54:18.668
Suit yourself.

54:31.648 --> 54:32.783
Go on. Get him outta here.

54:48.497 --> 54:51.733
<i>Doc's goon dropped me
off in a deserted part of town,</i>

54:51.735 --> 54:53.768
<i>just to aggravate me.</i>

54:53.770 --> 54:56.970
<i>But I guess it was better than being
dropped off the side of a bridge.</i>

55:15.524 --> 55:16.959
Get him. Get him.

55:19.628 --> 55:20.694
Stop!

55:53.929 --> 55:56.596
- Make a choice. Make a choice.
- No, no, no.

55:56.598 --> 55:59.801
You know what?
I don't even like them sons of bitches.

56:39.941 --> 56:43.011
All right, what's so important that
you wouldn't talk on the phone?

56:43.912 --> 56:45.579
Carson's in trouble.

56:46.813 --> 56:47.848
So?

56:48.849 --> 56:51.516
Some hit men followed
him out from LA.

56:51.518 --> 56:53.154
The morgue's filling up.
He killed two of them.

56:54.755 --> 56:55.756
Really?

57:00.627 --> 57:01.828
Isn't that interesting?

57:03.730 --> 57:05.133
What you want me
to do about it?

57:06.134 --> 57:08.068
Make this
his last warning.

57:11.604 --> 57:12.705
And with Jaynie?

57:14.141 --> 57:15.176
Keep squeezing.

57:16.643 --> 57:17.778
Better for all of us.

57:20.881 --> 57:23.749
- I want every drop of that oil.
- All right.

57:38.899 --> 57:40.167
"Arrest imminent!"

57:41.902 --> 57:45.869
You know, we ID'd those shooters.
They're from LA.

57:45.871 --> 57:47.773
But I think you
already knew that.

57:48.741 --> 57:49.775
They're hit men.

57:50.643 --> 57:51.812
Wanna tell me who they are?

57:52.946 --> 57:55.082
They're hit men.

57:58.050 --> 57:59.683
Don't get cute
with me, Carson.

57:59.685 --> 58:01.218
I'll throw you in the hole
with them sodomites.

58:01.220 --> 58:02.954
They'll have a good
ol' time with you, too.

58:02.956 --> 58:05.225
Mmm. Well, I can
take care of myself.

58:07.760 --> 58:08.995
How much money you owe them?

58:10.062 --> 58:11.661
Fifty thousand.

58:11.663 --> 58:12.797
Fifty thousand?

58:13.732 --> 58:14.932
On gambling?

58:14.934 --> 58:16.934
What difference
does it make?

58:16.936 --> 58:19.670
Now look, Walsh.
I'll make you a deal.

58:19.672 --> 58:21.972
You lay off Becky,
and I'll leave town.

58:21.974 --> 58:23.873
You'll never hear
from me again.

58:23.875 --> 58:25.942
I don't think you're in
no position to make a deal.

58:25.944 --> 58:28.280
Oh, yes, I am.
With what I know.

58:29.048 --> 58:30.082
Lay off Becky.

58:30.983 --> 58:32.648
Can't do that, Carson.

58:32.650 --> 58:34.984
Thanks to you,
everybody's watching now.

58:34.986 --> 58:37.787
Oh, what's that
supposed to mean?

58:37.789 --> 58:40.960
That don't concern you.
Oh, it does concern me.

58:43.195 --> 58:44.829
Let me ask you something.

58:46.865 --> 58:52.702
You think helping Jayne is somehow gonna
wipe away all your sins from the past?

58:52.704 --> 58:55.740
The way you just got up outta
here and left that girl behind?

58:58.109 --> 59:02.213
My leaving Jayne here was the best
thing I could've possibly done for her.

59:05.117 --> 59:07.850
You do know it's gonna be
easy to get a conviction.

59:07.852 --> 59:09.852
Jayne is not
very well liked around here.

59:09.854 --> 59:12.255
Now, why would Jayne not be
very well liked around here?

59:12.257 --> 59:14.157
What did she ever
do to anybody?

59:14.159 --> 59:17.727
Her husband Charlie's oil
poisoned the place.

59:17.729 --> 59:19.929
Done everything we could do
to keep it a secret.

59:19.931 --> 59:21.732
This is a beach town, remember?

59:29.240 --> 59:30.275
Recognize her?

59:34.678 --> 59:36.011
That's Becky.

59:36.013 --> 59:38.647
And you should know
that she told me

59:38.649 --> 59:42.018
that Happy beat the hell out of
her on more than one occasion.

59:42.020 --> 59:43.921
One time,
he damn near killed her.

59:44.855 --> 59:47.089
And why didn't you
do anything about it?

59:47.091 --> 59:49.324
Like what?
Arrest our star quarterback?

59:54.432 --> 59:58.767
I can make your little shoot-out last
night a clear case of self-defense

59:58.769 --> 01:00:02.139
or I can make sure
you rot in jail.

01:00:02.906 --> 01:00:04.741
This is Texas, after all.

01:00:07.044 --> 01:00:08.846
I'm gonna see my client.

01:00:09.913 --> 01:00:11.014
Your move.

01:00:28.966 --> 01:00:31.034
Thank you. I know.

01:00:31.734 --> 01:00:32.768
Hard.

01:00:42.945 --> 01:00:44.148
Becky?

01:00:52.755 --> 01:00:54.788
- Hi.
- I know that guy.

01:00:54.790 --> 01:00:56.391
I seen him before.
What's his name?

01:00:56.393 --> 01:00:59.827
That's Don.
He was one of Happy's best friends.

01:00:59.829 --> 01:01:02.365
Right. That's where I saw him.
I saw him at the club.

01:01:04.867 --> 01:01:07.234
So, how you doing?

01:01:07.236 --> 01:01:09.837
Better.
Good, good.

01:01:09.839 --> 01:01:12.206
Would you mind if I
asked you some questions?

01:01:12.208 --> 01:01:15.042
Would you be all right with that?
Listen, I don't know anything.

01:01:15.044 --> 01:01:17.713
Can I ask how things
were going before?

01:01:22.984 --> 01:01:25.952
Look, Becky, I know about Rose
and maybe some others, so...

01:01:25.954 --> 01:01:29.356
You know, unless you're able to tell
me, I can't help you.

01:01:29.358 --> 01:01:32.193
- Sorry, it's just embarrassing.
- Yeah.

01:01:32.195 --> 01:01:35.096
He fooled around a lot before
we were engaged, but...

01:01:35.964 --> 01:01:37.199
promised he wouldn't
do it anymore.

01:01:40.136 --> 01:01:42.002
Well, you gotta
tell me something.

01:01:42.004 --> 01:01:45.272
Was Happy doing drugs?
No. He was a workout nut.

01:01:45.274 --> 01:01:49.175
Well, this is the problem, Becky.
We got this crazy sheriff, Walsh.

01:01:49.177 --> 01:01:54.215
He thinks you're the only suspect
and that you have prime motive.

01:01:54.217 --> 01:01:55.984
I didn't kill
my husband.

01:01:59.888 --> 01:02:01.223
You okay, honey?

01:02:04.393 --> 01:02:06.359
I seen them pictures
Walsh showed me.

01:02:06.361 --> 01:02:08.995
You never told me that
he was hurting her.

01:02:08.997 --> 01:02:10.463
That's motive, Jayne.

01:02:10.465 --> 01:02:12.232
Come on.

01:02:12.234 --> 01:02:14.968
If you want me to help you,
you gotta tell me everything.

01:02:14.970 --> 01:02:17.070
Isn't it clear to you that
she didn't do it, Carson?

01:02:17.072 --> 01:02:18.905
That is not the point.

01:02:18.907 --> 01:02:21.374
Look, everyone in this town
doesn't like you. Why?

01:02:21.376 --> 01:02:23.976
Of course they don't.
I'm rich.

01:02:23.978 --> 01:02:27.046
No, no. They said that your
husband poisoned everybody

01:02:27.048 --> 01:02:29.215
or whatever the hell
that means.

01:02:29.217 --> 01:02:31.817
Look, you gotta
come straight with me

01:02:31.819 --> 01:02:33.954
and she's gotta get
straight with me.

01:02:39.861 --> 01:02:41.196
Let me show you something.

01:02:49.937 --> 01:02:51.471
From what I understand,

01:02:51.473 --> 01:02:53.872
Charlie paid off every
inspector in the State of Texas

01:02:53.874 --> 01:02:55.242
to get this place
up and running.

01:02:56.210 --> 01:02:59.213
Within a year,
people started getting sick.

01:03:00.247 --> 01:03:01.446
They tested the groundwater.

01:03:01.448 --> 01:03:04.151
The reports were inconclusive.

01:03:05.152 --> 01:03:07.388
I don't really believe that.

01:03:08.455 --> 01:03:11.258
Just more corruption,
like everything else in this town.

01:03:13.059 --> 01:03:14.962
People die and nobody cares.

01:03:17.064 --> 01:03:18.330
I...

01:03:18.332 --> 01:03:21.266
I found all this out
after Charlie died.

01:03:21.268 --> 01:03:24.101
Well, that's not
your responsibility.

01:03:24.103 --> 01:03:25.138
Well...

01:03:26.372 --> 01:03:28.407
it is.
Why?

01:03:28.409 --> 01:03:29.243
I...

01:03:30.511 --> 01:03:33.147
I wanted life to be easy
for our daughter.

01:03:37.050 --> 01:03:38.282
Our daughter.

01:03:38.284 --> 01:03:40.087
Carson, she's our daughter.

01:03:42.589 --> 01:03:44.123
The hell you
talking about?

01:03:45.426 --> 01:03:48.561
When I came to visit you
before I married Charlie.

01:03:50.129 --> 01:03:52.029
Why wouldn't you tell me
something like that?

01:03:52.031 --> 01:03:54.466
Well, you sure as hell weren't
ready for marriage and a baby!

01:03:54.468 --> 01:03:56.436
Don't I have something
to do with that decision?

01:03:57.403 --> 01:03:58.438
Come on!

01:04:00.139 --> 01:04:02.040
Why'd you leave me
in the first place?

01:04:04.110 --> 01:04:06.446
You said you'd take me with you.
Why didn't you?

01:04:10.183 --> 01:04:11.284
I'm sorry.

01:04:14.052 --> 01:04:15.221
I'm so sorry.

01:04:22.128 --> 01:04:26.298
I never stopped loving you.
Are you sure?

01:04:38.043 --> 01:04:39.612
<i>So it turns
out I had a daughter.</i>

01:04:40.546 --> 01:04:43.581
<i>This trip is full of surprises.</i>

01:04:43.583 --> 01:04:48.019
<i>And I have to admit that I was overcome
with the strangest of instincts.</i>

01:04:48.353 --> 01:04:50.320
<i>Strange for me, anyway.</i>

01:04:50.322 --> 01:04:54.059
<i>I actually started to think
of others instead of myself.</i>

01:04:55.427 --> 01:04:57.295
<i>I couldn't imagine
what would come next.</i>

01:05:01.133 --> 01:05:03.269
- Hello.
- <i>Mr. Phillips.</i>

01:05:03.469 --> 01:05:05.068
Yup.

01:05:05.070 --> 01:05:07.137
It's Michael Townsend,
the coroner.

01:05:07.139 --> 01:05:11.474
You asked me to call you when the
medical report came in on Mr. Chandler.

01:05:11.476 --> 01:05:12.677
Yeah, go ahead.

01:05:13.845 --> 01:05:17.282
It was a high concentration
of amphetamines and steroids.

01:05:18.283 --> 01:05:21.684
<i>There was also a finding
of doxorubicin in his system.</i>

01:05:21.686 --> 01:05:23.655
What the hell is that?
<i>Well...</i>

01:05:24.489 --> 01:05:27.056
that's the odd part.
It's a cancer drug.

01:05:27.058 --> 01:05:28.460
Cancer drug?

01:05:30.228 --> 01:05:32.362
Well, you can't buy that
over the counter.

01:05:32.364 --> 01:05:35.534
Oh, no. It has to be
prescribed by a physician.

01:05:37.601 --> 01:05:39.070
All right. Thank you.

01:06:11.502 --> 01:06:12.670
Hey, you!

01:06:13.671 --> 01:06:15.139
What you got there?

01:06:15.607 --> 01:06:17.372
Coffee?
Coffee.

01:06:17.374 --> 01:06:20.311
Well, I'm gonna have to put
a bit of bourbon in that.

01:06:21.812 --> 01:06:24.347
Come on. Now I'm impressed.

01:06:26.417 --> 01:06:27.618
Come on in.

01:06:31.522 --> 01:06:32.656
She told you.

01:06:33.424 --> 01:06:35.691
I'm not dumb.

01:06:35.693 --> 01:06:38.429
You could tell a lot just by
the way she looked at you.

01:06:39.563 --> 01:06:41.732
She never had that look
in her eye with Charlie.

01:06:43.667 --> 01:06:45.634
I asked her what was
really going on.

01:06:45.636 --> 01:06:48.371
She said you were
the love of her life.

01:06:49.606 --> 01:06:51.740
When Charlie proposed...

01:06:51.742 --> 01:06:55.245
she went out to visit you in
Los Angeles just to make sure.

01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:58.681
She made the right choice.

01:06:59.482 --> 01:07:01.684
I'm scared.
Don't be.

01:07:02.653 --> 01:07:04.454
Ain't nothing gonna
happen to you.

01:07:05.455 --> 01:07:06.556
You understand?

01:07:10.326 --> 01:07:11.361
Come on in.

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:21.369
Well, what do you think?
You think I need coffee or bourbon?

01:07:21.371 --> 01:07:22.405
Coffee.

01:07:23.138 --> 01:07:25.340
Coffee? All right,
have a seat.

01:07:26.376 --> 01:07:28.576
Have a seat.
Sorry about the mess.

01:07:28.578 --> 01:07:31.781
I'm just not very good
at taking care of myself.

01:07:32.715 --> 01:07:34.649
You sure are.

01:07:34.651 --> 01:07:37.651
You're one...
one beautiful girl.

01:07:37.653 --> 01:07:39.754
All right now,
what do we got here?

01:07:39.756 --> 01:07:42.392
- You got a coffee, regular, for you.
- Yes.

01:07:42.692 --> 01:07:44.759
And for me.

01:07:44.761 --> 01:07:47.694
And what did you buy here?
Doughnuts.

01:07:47.696 --> 01:07:49.498
Oh! I like these.

01:07:50.232 --> 01:07:51.234
Here you go.

01:07:51.501 --> 01:07:53.501
- One for you.
- Thank you.

01:07:53.503 --> 01:07:54.671
And one for me.

01:07:55.905 --> 01:07:58.672
Would you like me to teach you
how they eat doughnuts in LA?

01:07:58.674 --> 01:08:00.774
Yeah.
I can't.

01:08:00.776 --> 01:08:03.680
'Cause they don't eat doughnuts in LA.
They eat sprouts.

01:08:04.614 --> 01:08:09.217
However, I can show you
how they do it in Texas.

01:08:09.651 --> 01:08:10.686
You ready?

01:08:12.354 --> 01:08:13.455
Dunk.

01:08:18.426 --> 01:08:19.861
Maybe smaller bites.

01:08:20.761 --> 01:08:22.162
Yeah.

01:08:23.665 --> 01:08:25.564
You're too pretty
to be dunkin' doughnuts.

01:08:25.566 --> 01:08:27.667
Cheers.

01:08:27.669 --> 01:08:29.738
First time I've ever toasted
without liquor in it.

01:08:39.581 --> 01:08:40.716
What the hell?

01:08:42.783 --> 01:08:43.852
It's Slide.

01:08:46.453 --> 01:08:47.755
Becky, close the door.

01:08:50.425 --> 01:08:52.559
The hell happened to you?

01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:54.895
I went over to see Lorenzo.

01:08:55.429 --> 01:08:57.796
To do what?
To collect some money?

01:08:57.798 --> 01:09:00.600
You lied to me, Slide.
Becky, get some towels.

01:09:01.569 --> 01:09:03.671
Why? Why this game?

01:09:04.471 --> 01:09:05.707
A hunch?

01:09:06.439 --> 01:09:08.573
- You expect me to believe that?
- Yeah.

01:09:08.576 --> 01:09:11.877
What the hell was that for?

01:09:11.879 --> 01:09:14.680
Because that girl in there
has a lot to lose

01:09:14.683 --> 01:09:16.417
if I don't get to
the bottom of it.

01:09:17.818 --> 01:09:20.419
- I did bring your replacement pills.
- Oh, thank you.

01:09:20.421 --> 01:09:22.756
I'll try not to drop them
down the toilet this time.

01:09:24.256 --> 01:09:25.591
Oh, damn it.

01:09:27.328 --> 01:09:28.861
You ain't that tough, Slide.

01:09:28.863 --> 01:09:31.563
- Now just tell me the truth. Just do it.
- Okay. Okay.

01:09:31.564 --> 01:09:32.832
Jaynie?

01:09:39.807 --> 01:09:43.341
I overheard this conversation
between Doc and Happy.

01:09:43.343 --> 01:09:46.011
Happy owed Doc
a shitload of money.

01:09:46.013 --> 01:09:49.482
- I'll see you later in my office.
- See you around, Carson.

01:09:50.251 --> 01:09:52.518
Then Doc told him,

01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:55.954
"The only way you're gonna get even
with me is if you throw the game."

01:09:55.956 --> 01:09:59.691
Starting a fistfight on the night before
a big game. Have you lost your mind?

01:09:59.693 --> 01:10:00.927
<i>Go home to your wife.</i>

01:10:01.961 --> 01:10:03.396
That's the truth.

01:10:03.964 --> 01:10:05.697
That's what I thought.

01:10:05.699 --> 01:10:07.598
- Then Happy got greedy.
- Very greedy.

01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:10.435
The kid wants more.
What should we do?

01:10:10.437 --> 01:10:12.704
You need to step up and take
care of that little problem of ours.

01:10:12.706 --> 01:10:14.539
Go, go, go.

01:10:14.541 --> 01:10:16.609
Mitchell made all the bets
so it wouldn't look suspicious.

01:10:17.477 --> 01:10:18.611
And then he killed him.

01:10:20.714 --> 01:10:21.715
I knew it.

01:10:22.716 --> 01:10:23.750
Jaynie?

01:10:24.918 --> 01:10:26.851
What the hell
are you doing here?

01:10:26.853 --> 01:10:27.887
Sorry to interrupt.

01:10:29.456 --> 01:10:31.391
- Becky around?
- No.

01:10:31.758 --> 01:10:33.425
Well, we need
to talk to her.

01:10:33.893 --> 01:10:35.827
Oh, God. Shit. I knew it!

01:10:35.829 --> 01:10:37.696
You gonna help me, though,
aren't ya?

01:10:50.810 --> 01:10:52.577
- Yeah.
- <i>Carson.</i>

01:10:52.579 --> 01:10:55.414
Walsh is here with
an arrest warrant for Becky.

01:10:58.417 --> 01:10:59.451
Put him on.

01:11:03.522 --> 01:11:04.822
Carson, where is she?

01:11:04.824 --> 01:11:06.656
<i>Now listen to me,
Walsh.</i>

01:11:06.658 --> 01:11:09.659
You trusted me one time,
and I need you to trust me again.

01:11:09.661 --> 01:11:12.430
I know for a fact that
that game was fixed.

01:11:12.965 --> 01:11:15.799
A lot of people could've
benefited from it.

01:11:15.801 --> 01:11:17.400
And I know who they are.

01:11:17.402 --> 01:11:19.870
She was seen stalking him
outside of Rose's.

01:11:19.872 --> 01:11:22.038
<i>The game was fixed!</i>

01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:25.610
Give me 24 hours,
and I will find your killer.

01:11:28.647 --> 01:11:29.748
You better be right.

01:11:30.849 --> 01:11:33.484
Else it'll be your tit in
the ringer along with hers.

01:11:34.652 --> 01:11:36.719
I owe you, Walsh.

01:11:36.721 --> 01:11:39.424
And watch your mouth.
That's my daughter you're talking about.

01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:50.734
Carson, he's gone.

01:11:50.736 --> 01:11:52.503
I heard you went to see Doc.

01:11:52.805 --> 01:11:54.403
<i>We made a deal.</i>

01:11:54.405 --> 01:11:56.641
He promised to keep
Walsh off Becky's back.

01:11:59.110 --> 01:12:00.978
<i>I knew I couldn't trust
anyone but you, Carson.</i>

01:12:02.581 --> 01:12:03.614
Thank you.

01:12:14.659 --> 01:12:16.727
To what do I owe
this surprise?

01:12:21.398 --> 01:12:22.934
I know about the fix.

01:12:25.002 --> 01:12:26.769
Now, relax.

01:12:26.771 --> 01:12:29.138
It's a perfect reason
to keep Happy alive.

01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:31.542
Kind of guaranteed
your arrangement.

01:12:34.744 --> 01:12:36.444
Makes sense.

01:12:36.446 --> 01:12:39.951
Now, unfortunately for you,
Happy got greedy.

01:12:40.651 --> 01:12:41.917
He got a partner.

01:12:41.919 --> 01:12:44.652
Now, I know Mitchell
was making drugs

01:12:44.654 --> 01:12:46.855
and Lorenzo was selling them

01:12:46.857 --> 01:12:49.791
and expanding and cutting
into your business.

01:12:49.793 --> 01:12:52.427
And maybe he paid
his debt off to you,

01:12:52.429 --> 01:12:54.098
and you lost your edge.

01:12:54.731 --> 01:12:57.101
And maybe you
set them both up.

01:12:58.869 --> 01:13:00.635
Good theory.

01:13:00.637 --> 01:13:02.106
And you make a good point.

01:13:03.007 --> 01:13:05.941
I would be happier with
those two out of the way,

01:13:05.943 --> 01:13:07.942
but I'd rather
sit back and watch.

01:13:07.944 --> 01:13:09.980
You break up the drug ring,

01:13:10.647 --> 01:13:12.780
Lorenzo disappears,

01:13:12.782 --> 01:13:14.782
Mitchell can't pay me,

01:13:14.784 --> 01:13:18.086
and Pleasant Meadows
becomes the best resort

01:13:18.088 --> 01:13:21.024
and 18 holes
in all of South Texas.

01:13:22.826 --> 01:13:24.094
You want a free membership?

01:13:27.631 --> 01:13:29.933
There's a man like me
in every town.

01:13:33.837 --> 01:13:34.971
We're all alike.

01:13:37.539 --> 01:13:38.875
Some are just...

01:13:40.010 --> 01:13:41.044
better.

01:13:45.848 --> 01:13:48.183
I never lose, Carson.

01:13:50.754 --> 01:13:51.922
I'll keep that in mind.

01:16:01.681 --> 01:16:02.716
Here you go.

01:16:05.086 --> 01:16:07.054
- Good job.
- My wife.

01:16:08.121 --> 01:16:10.891
What were you doing,
rolling around in a grave?

01:16:11.792 --> 01:16:14.060
<i>Rolling around in a grave?</i>

01:16:14.062 --> 01:16:16.761
She's dead.
And she's not the only one.

01:16:16.763 --> 01:16:18.963
That's fresh dirt.
I can get that cleaned up for you.

01:16:18.965 --> 01:16:22.002
People just disappear here.
This is a bad place.

01:16:23.970 --> 01:16:25.704
You all right, Mr. Phillips?

01:16:44.124 --> 01:16:45.325
Found you.

01:16:47.226 --> 01:16:49.195
Good evening,
Mr. Carson Phillips.

01:16:51.765 --> 01:16:52.899
Miles.

01:16:53.233 --> 01:16:56.169
Why couldn't you
just get lost?

01:16:56.869 --> 01:16:59.004
You were warned
so many times.

01:17:00.072 --> 01:17:01.140
Just let me guess.

01:17:02.909 --> 01:17:06.279
You was billing patients'
families after they was dead?

01:17:06.879 --> 01:17:08.712
That didn't make
you enough money,

01:17:08.714 --> 01:17:11.014
so you started
a new business with Lorenzo.

01:17:11.016 --> 01:17:13.016
Is that right?

01:17:13.018 --> 01:17:15.986
Mmm, that's about the slow
and skinny of it. Mm-hmm.

01:17:15.988 --> 01:17:18.088
Well, let me congratulate you.
Hmm.

01:17:18.090 --> 01:17:20.057
'Cause you're on the way to
being the biggest meth dealer

01:17:20.059 --> 01:17:21.327
in the State of Texas.

01:17:21.827 --> 01:17:22.928
Thank you.

01:17:23.229 --> 01:17:25.164
It looks like you
saved me some work.

01:17:26.333 --> 01:17:31.068
No, no, no, no.
This grave ain't big enough for me.

01:17:31.070 --> 01:17:32.936
Why don't you give me
a helping hand?

01:17:32.938 --> 01:17:36.107
I can't get my hands any more dirty.
Put the shovel...

01:17:44.150 --> 01:17:45.317
I kill you!

01:18:05.404 --> 01:18:08.106
I got you, <i>cabrón!</i>

01:18:36.501 --> 01:18:37.902
You hear me?

01:18:41.039 --> 01:18:42.207
I'm coming!

01:18:53.418 --> 01:18:54.452
What the hell?

01:19:19.376 --> 01:19:21.311
I got you, motherfucker!

01:19:42.432 --> 01:19:43.467
Fuck!

01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:51.308
Fuck.

01:19:55.211 --> 01:19:56.378
No, no, no, no!

01:19:56.380 --> 01:19:57.413
No!

01:20:08.924 --> 01:20:09.959
It's over, Miles.

01:20:12.028 --> 01:20:13.029
It's over.

01:20:15.499 --> 01:20:17.133
Put the gun down.

01:20:19.402 --> 01:20:20.501
Put it down.

01:20:20.503 --> 01:20:22.405
Go ahead. Put it down.

01:20:26.510 --> 01:20:28.210
Now, you be a gentleman.

01:20:29.378 --> 01:20:30.413
Be a gentleman...

01:20:32.014 --> 01:20:33.149
and just tell me...

01:20:34.983 --> 01:20:37.252
you poisoned Happy
with them bad drugs.

01:20:43.992 --> 01:20:46.393
And that you murdered him.

01:20:46.395 --> 01:20:47.563
You tell me that.

01:20:49.164 --> 01:20:50.199
Say it.

01:20:56.539 --> 01:20:57.573
Sorry.

01:21:02.511 --> 01:21:05.448
I always knew that you
were one of the greats.

01:21:14.357 --> 01:21:16.490
Yeah,
he got what he deserved!

01:22:01.335 --> 01:22:03.238
You wouldn't happen to have a
light, would you?

01:22:04.372 --> 01:22:05.440
What happened here?

01:22:08.041 --> 01:22:11.076
Well, let's see.

01:22:11.078 --> 01:22:13.414
You got Mitchell's meth
lab that just blew up,

01:22:15.082 --> 01:22:20.554
and you got a whole bunch of his
patients buried all over these grounds.

01:22:22.021 --> 01:22:23.290
Well, I ain't surprised.

01:22:26.460 --> 01:22:27.629
What was
I supposed to do?

01:22:28.429 --> 01:22:29.694
Well, I don't know.

01:22:29.696 --> 01:22:33.331
What were you supposed
to do, <i>Sheriff?</i>

01:22:33.333 --> 01:22:35.634
That ain't the way
things run around here.

01:22:35.636 --> 01:22:37.103
You should know better.

01:22:38.439 --> 01:22:39.606
Where's Miles at?

01:22:43.243 --> 01:22:45.176
Miles is dead.

01:22:45.178 --> 01:22:49.346
And he told me that he was the
one who gave Happy them bad drugs

01:22:49.348 --> 01:22:53.387
just to cover his bets or
guarantee they would happen.

01:22:55.154 --> 01:22:57.656
I told you Becky never had
anything to do with this.

01:22:57.658 --> 01:22:59.091
I told you that.

01:23:03.464 --> 01:23:07.333
Fraud. Drug smuggling. Murder.

01:23:09.235 --> 01:23:11.437
You got some case
on your hands, buddy.

01:23:13.104 --> 01:23:14.773
Some case.

01:23:14.775 --> 01:23:17.274
I wouldn't be surprised if
you were reelected next year.

01:23:18.544 --> 01:23:20.279
I like the sound of that.

01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:22.315
Any holes?

01:23:24.216 --> 01:23:26.319
Just the ones you're gonna
be digging up tonight.

01:23:28.621 --> 01:23:30.323
You gonna lay off Becky?

01:23:33.158 --> 01:23:34.192
Well...

01:23:36.428 --> 01:23:37.530
everyone's dead.

01:23:49.642 --> 01:23:51.277
You look like shit.

01:23:53.246 --> 01:23:54.279
Want a drink?

01:23:57.315 --> 01:23:59.551
It's 1:00 a.m.
Do you ever sleep?

01:24:00.185 --> 01:24:01.387
I try not to.

01:24:02.555 --> 01:24:04.724
I hate those little
snippets of death.

01:24:06.692 --> 01:24:10.428
So, I understand
you had quite a night.

01:24:11.329 --> 01:24:13.364
Oh. You already heard.

01:24:13.366 --> 01:24:14.400
So...

01:24:15.467 --> 01:24:17.770
my competition is
no longer with us.

01:24:19.371 --> 01:24:20.305
Now...

01:24:21.273 --> 01:24:23.375
I guess I owe you one,
Carson.

01:24:24.241 --> 01:24:26.142
Well, I'm glad
you feel that way.

01:24:26.144 --> 01:24:29.445
And I understand that you
made a deal with Jayne.

01:24:29.447 --> 01:24:31.514
I did.

01:24:31.516 --> 01:24:34.184
I'm guessing it has something
to do with her oil wells.

01:24:34.586 --> 01:24:36.451
Mm-hmm.

01:24:36.453 --> 01:24:40.659
And I'm sure she asked you
to ask Walsh to back off.

01:24:41.326 --> 01:24:42.427
She did.

01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:44.396
And I asked him.

01:24:45.396 --> 01:24:46.497
And he didn't.

01:24:48.532 --> 01:24:49.568
He didn't?

01:24:51.336 --> 01:24:54.202
Is Becky in trouble?
Not anymore.

01:24:54.204 --> 01:24:56.538
Miles killed Happy.

01:25:04.749 --> 01:25:05.784
Says you.

01:25:06.751 --> 01:25:08.352
There's no proof.

01:25:09.386 --> 01:25:10.688
Just you saying so.

01:25:13.391 --> 01:25:16.659
You might wanna
let this one go, Carson.

01:25:16.661 --> 01:25:19.630
Unless, of course,
you want this whole thing reopened.

01:25:22.933 --> 01:25:28.305
The deal I made with Jayne
is between me and her.

01:25:33.276 --> 01:25:36.847
There's no end to the lengths a mother
will go to protect her daughter.

01:25:39.683 --> 01:25:41.518
When's enough enough?

01:25:44.622 --> 01:25:46.322
There's always more.

01:25:55.699 --> 01:25:56.834
Thanks for the drink.

01:25:58.635 --> 01:25:59.869
I told you, Carson.

01:26:01.305 --> 01:26:02.539
I never lose.

01:26:04.742 --> 01:26:06.142
Yeah, you told me.

01:26:40.009 --> 01:26:41.344
It's all over.

01:26:42.612 --> 01:26:44.446
I knew I could
count on you.

01:27:39.035 --> 01:27:40.769
Good morning.
Morning.

01:27:42.637 --> 01:27:44.706
You looked so peaceful,
I didn't want to wake you.

01:27:46.875 --> 01:27:47.875
How you doing?

01:27:48.609 --> 01:27:50.011
Wonderful. You?

01:27:51.713 --> 01:27:52.748
Me, too.

01:27:54.850 --> 01:27:55.884
Want some breakfast?

01:27:56.584 --> 01:27:58.350
Thanks.

01:27:58.352 --> 01:28:00.387
What, for last night
or for breakfast?

01:28:01.823 --> 01:28:03.992
Well, I haven't had
breakfast yet.

01:28:07.561 --> 01:28:08.794
Get dressed.

01:28:08.796 --> 01:28:10.498
Let's join our daughter.

01:28:15.636 --> 01:28:17.805
Some things never change.

01:28:19.373 --> 01:28:22.710
Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man.

01:29:05.652 --> 01:29:08.721
Last night felt like
it was 20 years ago.

01:29:10.790 --> 01:29:12.559
When we were younger...

01:29:14.394 --> 01:29:15.528
and healthier.

01:29:16.931 --> 01:29:19.065
How much time
do you have, Jayne?

01:29:24.971 --> 01:29:26.006
Not much.

01:29:27.807 --> 01:29:32.476
You told me you met Barbara
Van Poole at the sanitarium.

01:29:32.478 --> 01:29:35.645
Now, did you cook all this up
so I would come out,

01:29:35.647 --> 01:29:37.982
clean it up,
get Becky off the hook?

01:29:37.984 --> 01:29:39.884
Is that what you did?

01:29:39.886 --> 01:29:42.655
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

01:29:44.924 --> 01:29:47.826
A mother will do anything
to protect her daughter.

01:29:49.495 --> 01:29:51.497
Tell me that
you did it, Jayne.

01:29:52.464 --> 01:29:53.933
It might make you feel better.

01:29:55.667 --> 01:29:56.802
Mama,
what's going on?

01:30:02.542 --> 01:30:04.110
Did you kill
my husband, Mama?

01:30:07.013 --> 01:30:08.580
Tell her, Jayne.

01:30:09.948 --> 01:30:10.983
Mama.

01:30:20.492 --> 01:30:22.458
He was a monster.

01:30:22.460 --> 01:30:23.695
He would've killed you.

01:30:24.495 --> 01:30:26.165
He would've killed you.

01:30:30.102 --> 01:30:31.103
Sweetheart.

01:30:34.806 --> 01:30:38.075
I knew I wasn't gonna
be around to protect you.

01:30:38.077 --> 01:30:40.612
There was no other way
to save you, honey.

01:30:47.952 --> 01:30:49.755
I'm so sorry.

01:30:56.995 --> 01:31:01.631
<i>In 1971, scientists
predicted that a comet named Kohoutek</i>

01:31:01.633 --> 01:31:05.636
<i>would pass closer to Earth than
any other heavenly body in history.</i>

01:31:06.871 --> 01:31:10.105
<i>Timothy Leary said it was
a cosmic windshield wiper</i>

01:31:10.107 --> 01:31:13.644
<i>that would wash this planet
clean of all its bad karma.</i>

01:31:15.546 --> 01:31:17.980
<i>The hippies waited
with baited breath,</i>

01:31:17.982 --> 01:31:20.516
<i>but '71 came and went.</i>

01:31:20.518 --> 01:31:22.920
<i>Somehow, Kohoutek
veered off into space.</i>

01:31:27.858 --> 01:31:31.062
<i>They say we'll have to wait another
thousand years for it to return.</i>

01:31:32.296 --> 01:31:35.132
<i>Till then, someone else will
have to deal with all this shit.</i>

01:31:44.008 --> 01:31:46.977
<i>To say goodbye
is to die a little.</i>

01:31:50.047 --> 01:31:51.949
<i>I wasn't quite ready for that.</i>

01:32:18.008 --> 01:32:19.909
<i>I wasn't in a hurry to go home.</i>

01:32:25.949 --> 01:32:29.219
<i>Then I realized,
I already was.</i>
