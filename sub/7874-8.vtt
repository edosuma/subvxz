WEBVTT

00:33.466 --> 00:35.467
The C.I.A. talent show is in a week.

00:35.468 --> 00:38.468
So I need everyone's help to-

00:50.683 --> 00:53.683
They found me.
Francine, get on the counter. Now!

01:03.730 --> 01:06.331
Francine, it's time
you learned the truth.

01:06.332 --> 01:09.332
My name is not Klaus.
It's Professor Max Hammer.

01:09.335 --> 01:11.770
And my job is to save the world.

01:19.012 --> 01:21.246
Dark forces have banded together-

01:21.247 --> 01:24.247
not all of them human.

01:24.250 --> 01:26.852
vampires!

01:26.853 --> 01:29.853
Mexican vampires.

01:33.993 --> 01:36.993
They are after this amulet.

01:49.042 --> 01:51.910
See? The lost city of Atlantis.

01:51.911 --> 01:54.911
I found it.

01:57.550 --> 02:00.550
And I found you.

02:05.959 --> 02:08.959
- Klaus, shut up!
- You shut up!

02:13.166 --> 02:16.135
Bwap! Did my interpretive
dance sell it?

02:16.136 --> 02:19.136
- I want a popcorn maker for my attic.
- Don't be stupid, Roger.

02:19.506 --> 02:22.506
The attic is above sea level,
and popcorn doesn't pop above sea level.

02:22.575 --> 02:24.576
I know. I,ve spent time in Denver.

02:24.577 --> 02:26.578
That's the dumbest thing
I,ve ever heard.

02:26.579 --> 02:29.579
It's not dumb, Roger.
My dad's a genius. He knows everything.

02:30.550 --> 02:32.551
So what's Denver like, Dad?

02:32.552 --> 02:35.552
Well, it's 2,000 miles above sea level,
so the winds are fierce.

02:35.989 --> 02:38.891
Hence its nickname: the Windy City.

02:38.892 --> 02:41.892
Wow. Maybe someday,
if I study hard enough...

02:41.928 --> 02:43.929
I can be as smart as you.

02:43.930 --> 02:46.930
Which reminds me.
I have an oral report on fossils tomorrow.

02:47.200 --> 02:50.200
I already know how to talk. So the remaining
10% of the work will be learning about fossils.

02:52.939 --> 02:55.939
Hmm. This sandwich could use
a little something.

02:59.913 --> 03:01.980
There we go!

03:01.981 --> 03:04.981
Now to just type "fossils...
into the search engine.

03:05.852 --> 03:08.852
And now to just separate
the fossil sites from the porn sites.

03:10.557 --> 03:13.557
"Tyrannosaurus.... Fossil.

03:14.127 --> 03:17.127
"Babe-osaurus.... Porn.

03:17.230 --> 03:20.230
"A symposium on the Pangaea theory
of the Permian extinction-...

03:20.300 --> 03:23.300
Wow! That is some nasty porn!

03:29.142 --> 03:31.143
Arnie, stop chewing on the line.

03:31.144 --> 03:34.144
Hi! Hi, Gilbert!

03:35.348 --> 03:37.416
Gilbert, I told you.

03:37.417 --> 03:40.417
- Your brother can't keep biting through utility lines.
- He won't,Jerry. I promise.

03:45.425 --> 03:48.126
The Internet is down!

03:51.197 --> 03:53.599
I was in the middle of
trading stocks online.

03:53.600 --> 03:56.600
I was about to make a killing in silver
and use the money to buy a popcorn maker!

03:57.537 --> 04:00.372
Forget your crazy dream
of popping corn above sea level.

04:00.373 --> 04:02.441
I have my report due tomorrow.

04:02.442 --> 04:04.243
- What's all the commotion?
- Wait.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.612
Dad, you can help me with my report.

04:06.613 --> 04:09.314
Uh, Steve, I don't think
that's a good idea.

04:09.315 --> 04:12.184
- Your dad's kind of a moron.
- No, he's not.

04:12.185 --> 04:14.253
Dad, do you know anything
about fossils?

04:14.254 --> 04:17.254
Are you kidding,? I know everything about fossils.
Steve, grab a pen.

04:18.625 --> 04:21.560
Then, in5.000B.C...

04:21.560 --> 04:24.561
a mere 1,000 years
after the creation of Earth...

04:24.864 --> 04:27.733
the human-dinosaur treaty
fell apart...

04:27.734 --> 04:30.435
and they drove
the dinosaurs underground.

04:30.436 --> 04:32.437
And that's where fossils come from.

04:32.438 --> 04:35.438
Dumb-ass.

04:36.809 --> 04:38.810
Damn it!

04:38.811 --> 04:41.346
- Problem, Steve?
- What are you doing here?

04:41.347 --> 04:43.448
And where did that
swivel chair come from?

04:43.449 --> 04:46.151
I brought it down from the attic
for dramatic effect.

04:46.152 --> 04:49.087
It wouldn't fit through the door,
so I had to take off the wheels.

04:49.088 --> 04:52.088
Frankly, it was a hassle.
But worth it, like Klaus's costume.

04:52.558 --> 04:55.558
It's fun to play dress up. Not all the time,
but sometimes. Not this time.

04:57.297 --> 05:00.297
I wrote down everything my dad told me,
and I got an "F... on my report.

05:00.767 --> 05:03.767
- He's an idiot!
- That's what I was trying to tell you.

05:04.237 --> 05:07.237
But relax. This isn't a bad thing.
It's an opportunity.

05:07.340 --> 05:09.641
As the two smartest people
in the house...

05:09.642 --> 05:12.642
we can manipulate your stupid father
to get everything we want!

05:13.246 --> 05:15.547
I don't know, Roger.
That sounds kind of mean.

05:15.548 --> 05:17.916
Steve, sympathy is for the herd.

05:17.917 --> 05:19.918
And you are a shepherd.

05:19.919 --> 05:21.920
I am a shepherd.

05:21.921 --> 05:24.921
All right!
Let's go screw some sheep!

05:25.458 --> 05:28.458
- Oh, I-
- Yeah, yeah. No. I know what you mean.

05:31.998 --> 05:34.998
Kudos to the way you conned my dad
into getting us this popcorn machine.

05:36.002 --> 05:39.002
It was just a matter of finding
the right way to combine the words...

05:39.038 --> 05:41.273
"tasty... "low-fat... and "9/11....

05:41.274 --> 05:44.274
Speaking of9/11,
I believe that was my dad's S.A.T. score.

05:45.178 --> 05:48.178
Sir, you are a wit.

05:48.881 --> 05:51.249
You should write for basic cable.

05:51.250 --> 05:54.250
Look at her, Steve. That is the most tasty,
low-fat 9/11 memorial ever.

05:58.458 --> 06:01.458
- Why are you laughing?
- Because your plebeian rodent brain...

06:01.527 --> 06:04.429
fell prey to the carnivorous hawk
that is my mind.

06:04.430 --> 06:06.631
You can't talk to me like that.

06:06.632 --> 06:09.301
Irregardless of what you think of me,
I,m still your father.

06:12.171 --> 06:15.171
"Irregardless...?
That's not even a real word.

06:15.308 --> 06:18.308
Y- You,re affixing
the negative prefix "ir... to "regardless....

06:18.578 --> 06:21.578
But as "regardless... is already negative,
it's a logical absurdity.

06:22.415 --> 06:25.415
- I have half a mind to-
- There he goes exaggerating again.

06:28.054 --> 06:30.122
You,re grounded.

06:30.123 --> 06:32.457
It's time, Steven.

06:32.458 --> 06:34.192
What's going on?

06:34.193 --> 06:36.194
I can't live
under the roof of a man...

06:36.195 --> 06:38.897
who's forcing me to walk
in his ignorant footsteps.

06:38.898 --> 06:40.966
And I can't live under the roof.

06:40.967 --> 06:43.502
Literally. I- I live
right under the roof, and I hate it.

06:43.503 --> 06:45.604
We,re going to
the one place on Earth...

06:45.605 --> 06:48.507
where we can turn our intelligence
into a big pile of money.

06:48.508 --> 06:50.409
Magic Land?

06:50.410 --> 06:53.410
- No. New York City.
- Fine. Go.

06:53.646 --> 06:56.646
Farewell, simpleton.

06:58.084 --> 07:01.084
Apresmoile deluge

07:01.621 --> 07:04.621
That's what Andrew Cunanan wrote
in his high school yearbook. Byesie-daisies.

07:06.259 --> 07:09.259
- Stan, do something.
- Trust me, Francine. Steve's not going anywhere.

07:10.963 --> 07:13.963
All he has is the shirt on his back and the $1,600
I gave him to pay this quarter's kid tax.

07:16.035 --> 07:19.035
By the way,
can you believe this kid tax?

07:21.174 --> 07:24.174
Bueno. Muchasgracias, Toshi

07:25.044 --> 07:28.044
None of Steve's friends have seen him.
I should have never let them leave.

07:28.748 --> 07:31.748
What if they really did
go to New York?

07:34.687 --> 07:37.687
Francine, they,re not in New York.

07:37.824 --> 07:40.824
They,re in the tree house?
Oh, thank God.

07:42.061 --> 07:45.061
Not so fast. It's time to teach
our little geniuses a lesson.

07:46.799 --> 07:49.799
We,ll ignore them
and see just how long they can last up there.

07:50.503 --> 07:52.971
Who's the idiot now?

07:56.442 --> 07:58.443
Arnie, stop playing
with the curtain.

07:58.444 --> 08:01.279
Don't you yell al him, Gilbert.
He's your brother.

08:01.280 --> 08:03.315
You have to
take care of your brother.

08:03.316 --> 08:06.316
- Yeah, Gilbert. You have to
take care of your brother.

08:18.831 --> 08:21.099
Hello, New York.

08:21.100 --> 08:24.100
And good-bye, struggling gay actor.

08:41.787 --> 08:44.787
Oh, my God! You missed it.
Some cameraman was just creamed by a bus.

08:46.259 --> 08:48.994
- Oh, my God!
- I know. Lunch?

08:52.598 --> 08:55.598
- We,ve made it, Steve.
- That's right, pal. New York City.

08:56.569 --> 08:59.569
No dumb people here.
They herd them all into New Jersey.

08:59.705 --> 09:02.705
Finally someone brave enough
to take a swipe at New Jersey.

09:02.742 --> 09:05.742
Look.

09:06.345 --> 09:09.180
If it isn't
Beauregard Les Fontaine...

09:09.181 --> 09:11.783
Langley Falls's
premier hair stylist.

09:11.784 --> 09:14.252
Well, slop me up
a bit of coincidence.

09:14.253 --> 09:16.988
What madey,all scooch on up
to the Big ol, Apple?

09:16.989 --> 09:19.989
Warn the cops,,cause I,m gonna
make a killing in the stock market.

09:20.593 --> 09:23.593
And I,m here to strike it rich
as a comedy writer for television.

09:24.196 --> 09:27.132
Or as I like to call it,
Smell-O-vision.

09:27.133 --> 09:29.568
As you can see,
I,m going to do very well.

09:29.569 --> 09:32.404
Well, delicately kiss
my pomegranates.

09:32.405 --> 09:34.439
I,m here to make a splash too.

09:34.440 --> 09:37.440
I,m gonna join New York's long tradition
of wealthy, obnoxious weirdos.

09:39.178 --> 09:42.178
Gentlemen, to our genius.

09:43.916 --> 09:46.184
Audience Laughing ]

09:46.185 --> 09:49.185
That is so Raven.

09:52.625 --> 09:55.625
Here's some brownies
for my little runaways.

09:58.631 --> 10:01.600
Arnie, come bring your mama
one of them brownies.

10:01.601 --> 10:04.601
I,m coming, Mama.

10:07.273 --> 10:10.273
Mmm! Oh, Arnie,
you,re my knight in shimmering armor.

10:19.852 --> 10:22.852
Steve, I- I read your sketch packet,
and I just had to meet you.

10:23.923 --> 10:26.923
I expected as much.
My comedic samplings are sublime.

10:27.093 --> 10:29.461
No. Not quite sublime.

10:29.462 --> 10:32.462
More the worst packet
I have ever read.

10:32.632 --> 10:35.632
What do you mean?
Everything in there is gold. Pure gold.

10:36.068 --> 10:39.068
Gold. Okay.
Uh, well, let's take the first sketch.

10:39.372 --> 10:42.173
Uh, I believe that one's
entitled "Quantum Rape....

10:44.510 --> 10:46.544
Come on. It's brilliant.

10:46.545 --> 10:49.545
It's about a guy
who gets thrown into a jail cell...

10:49.949 --> 10:52.949
and his cell mate is in there
because he just raped Scott Bakula.

10:53.452 --> 10:55.954
Yeah. And then the rapist
spends eight pages...

10:55.955 --> 10:58.657
explaining the premise of
Quantum Leap to the guy.

10:58.658 --> 11:01.593
But the guy just doesn't get it!

11:08.534 --> 11:11.169
Clearly Jon Stewart
was raped as a child.

11:11.170 --> 11:14.170
- What other explanation could there be?
- Don't worry. I got us covered.

11:14.540 --> 11:17.540
I put all of our money in the stock "SJ.P....
It's a sure thing.

11:18.144 --> 11:20.979
As soon as that bell rings,
we,ll be in the money.

11:20.980 --> 11:23.348
Here we go.

11:23.349 --> 11:26.349
Watch SJ.P. take off.

11:35.961 --> 11:38.129
What the hell was that?

11:38.130 --> 11:41.130
- You said SJ.P. was a sure thing.
- I don't understand.

11:41.333 --> 11:44.333
SJ.P. is in the new Spielberg movie.
It's gonna be huge.

11:44.904 --> 11:47.904
What are you talking about? SJ.P. is
a Canadian chiropractic supplies company.

11:49.608 --> 11:52.043
You mean it's not
Sarah Jessica Parker?

11:52.044 --> 11:54.045
What? No!

11:54.046 --> 11:56.414
Isn't this the Hollywood
Stock Exchange?

11:56.415 --> 11:59.184
You know, the Web site
where you buy and sell celebrity stocks...

11:59.185 --> 12:02.185
- based on the ups and downs of their careers.
- No!

12:02.488 --> 12:05.256
Oh. Then what is all this?

12:05.257 --> 12:07.726
This is the New York Stock Exchange!

12:07.727 --> 12:09.728
Like in the movie
Wall Street?

12:09.729 --> 12:11.730
I thought that was
Hollywood make-believe...

12:11.731 --> 12:14.666
like children of every color
being at the same McDonald's.

12:14.667 --> 12:17.667
But back home, you said
you were about to make a fortune in silver.

12:17.937 --> 12:19.471
Ron Silver!

12:24.310 --> 12:27.310
Wow. I guess running away
builds up an appetite.

12:28.881 --> 12:30.915
Mama.

12:30.916 --> 12:32.917
There's a storm coming,
Mama.

12:32.918 --> 12:35.487
Ooh! Scary.

12:35.488 --> 12:38.488
Scary storms up there, Mama.

12:40.993 --> 12:42.994
Mama?

12:42.995 --> 12:45.797
Mama, you,re hiding from me, huh?

12:45.798 --> 12:48.099
Mama's hiding from Arnie.

12:48.100 --> 12:50.702
I know that.

12:50.703 --> 12:52.971
Mama?

12:52.972 --> 12:55.972
Mama?

12:57.643 --> 13:00.643
Mama?

13:04.650 --> 13:07.650
Roger, we have 20 bucks left.

13:08.053 --> 13:10.054
We can't afford another night here.

13:10.055 --> 13:12.423
Would you relax?
I,ve got a plan.

13:12.424 --> 13:15.424
- May I help you?
- My friend and I will be staying indefinitely without paying.

13:22.501 --> 13:25.270
That seemed a little extreme.
Couldn't they just escort us out?

13:25.271 --> 13:28.271
- Roger, you spit in his face.
- I don't think so.

13:29.108 --> 13:32.108
That doesn't sound like me.

13:36.248 --> 13:39.217
Dad, you can't let Steve and Roger
stay in the tree house.

13:39.218 --> 13:42.218
- They,ll catch their death.
- Nonsense. Death has better things to do...

13:42.288 --> 13:44.556
like remembering
Tony Curtis already.

13:44.557 --> 13:46.624
They,ll stay out there
until they respect me.

13:46.625 --> 13:48.593
Trust me. A little rain
won't hurt,em.

13:55.334 --> 13:58.036
Oh, my God!
They,re dead!

14:00.039 --> 14:02.273
No!

14:02.274 --> 14:05.274
It's okay, Arnie.
It would have taken a crane to get her out.

14:05.811 --> 14:07.979
And this way, she won't be joke.

14:07.980 --> 14:10.980
Why?

14:12.284 --> 14:14.352
I can't feel my arms.

14:14.353 --> 14:17.353
Buck up. We,re gonna make it through this.
We still have 20 bucks.

14:17.590 --> 14:20.590
In this town, with our brains,
we,ll turn it into millions in no time.

14:21.193 --> 14:24.193
I,ll have the new issue of Cherry,
and keep the change, my good man.

14:25.631 --> 14:28.631
- Roger!
- Steve, it's a special big butts collector's issue.

14:29.435 --> 14:31.469
Someday it,ll be worth a fortune.

14:31.470 --> 14:34.470
Now we play the waiting game.

14:42.448 --> 14:45.448
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:45.584 --> 14:48.584
- How was your day?
- Fine.

14:49.555 --> 14:51.723
Washing the dishes?

14:51.724 --> 14:53.791
Mm-hmm.

14:53.792 --> 14:56.127
Honey, it's been three weeks.

14:56.128 --> 14:59.128
Maybe we should
start planning Steve's funeral.

15:00.466 --> 15:02.467
I wanted to go get him!

15:02.468 --> 15:05.468
I wanted to bring him inside!
But you wouldn't let me!

15:05.938 --> 15:08.640
Our baby's dead because of you!

15:08.641 --> 15:10.608
Don't you think I know that?

15:14.847 --> 15:16.848
No!

15:16.849 --> 15:19.849
- I can't make it, Stan.
- Yes, you can.

15:20.352 --> 15:22.620
Look, this is killing us.
We need to get away.

15:22.621 --> 15:24.789
We need to take a trip
far, far away.

15:24.790 --> 15:26.858
But we can't afford that.

15:26.859 --> 15:29.859
Well, there is
Steve's college money.

15:30.362 --> 15:33.362
Well, I guess he won't be needing it.

15:34.600 --> 15:37.600
Our little cowboy
is in a better place.

15:40.005 --> 15:42.540
So, basically,
all I have to do is stand here...

15:42.541 --> 15:45.176
and beautiful women
will pay me to have sex with them?

15:45.177 --> 15:48.177
- That's right.
- Prostitution is awesome!

15:48.347 --> 15:51.082
- Now, why am I wearing a cowboy outfit?
- It's your gimmick.

15:51.083 --> 15:53.851
You,re the Cowboy of Sixth Avenue.

15:53.852 --> 15:56.852
Howdy. Who wants to be
the first buckaroo through these double doors?

15:57.356 --> 15:59.424
Um, Roger, those were guys.

15:59.425 --> 16:02.425
I know. I just doubled your clientele.
I got a brain for business.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.862
I,m not having sex with guys.

16:04.863 --> 16:07.863
Do you want to crawl back to
your idiot father and admit you were wrong?

16:08.100 --> 16:10.168
That you couldn't
make it on your own?

16:10.169 --> 16:13.169
- That you don't have the brains to make it out here?
- No.

16:13.639 --> 16:16.639
Of course not. I,m here to make sure you never
have to go through anything that degrading.

16:18.477 --> 16:21.477
Now put these on.
They,re knee pads I made out of old diapers.

16:29.455 --> 16:32.455
I never thought
I could be happy again.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.859
I feel like Steve is here with us.

16:34.860 --> 16:37.829
Hey, Steve. Want to steer?

16:37.830 --> 16:40.365
Ah. Feels good to laugh.

16:44.269 --> 16:47.269
Roger, it's been two days
and no customers.

16:47.272 --> 16:49.974
Maybe my mouth's not as pretty
as you keep saying.

16:49.975 --> 16:52.910
- And your cough is getting worse.
- I,m fine.

16:52.911 --> 16:54.979
Let's just go back
to our cardboard box...

16:54.980 --> 16:57.648
and see if the rattrap
snagged us some din-din.

16:59.284 --> 17:02.186
Ooh! Ooh! A limo!
You can do this, Steve.

17:02.187 --> 17:05.186
Always remember.
You,re a whore.

17:06.025 --> 17:09.025
- Beauregard!
- Look at you two poor things out here in the cold.

17:10.662 --> 17:13.662
Why don'ty,all
come on back to my hotel?

17:14.199 --> 17:16.233
Steve, is this really happening?

17:16.234 --> 17:19.234
,Cause I just shotgunned a 40 of Robitussin,
and everything's kind of awesome.

17:27.512 --> 17:30.513
Your friend can rest here
while you and I adjourn to the bedroom.

17:32.684 --> 17:35.684
Oh. Oh, God. Um, uh, uh,
my friend's really sick.

17:36.555 --> 17:39.457
I don't think I should leave his side.
Right, Roger?

17:39.458 --> 17:42.458
No, I need some me time anyway.
You kids have fun.

17:53.605 --> 17:56.605
- These are my associates. They like to watch.
- Oh, that's unsettling.

17:58.210 --> 18:01.210
Steve, do you know who said,
"I can resist anything but temptation...?

18:03.348 --> 18:05.817
Um,Jesus?

18:05.818 --> 18:08.818
It was Oscar Wilde.

18:09.288 --> 18:12.288
- How gauche.
- Oh, yes.

18:12.291 --> 18:14.725
This is definitely my new boy.

18:14.726 --> 18:17.726
Just how I like,em.
Dumb as a bag of Mississippi mud.

18:18.330 --> 18:21.330
- Excuse me?
- See, my friends and I like to amuse ourselves...

18:21.733 --> 18:24.733
by finding stupid people
and mocking them.

18:24.803 --> 18:27.803
I,m not stupid.

18:28.607 --> 18:31.242
- I don't have to put up with this.
- Go ahead, Steve.

18:31.243 --> 18:32.977
Go back to the cold.

18:38.283 --> 18:41.283
That's what I thought. Now scooch
on over here and spell "hors d,oeuvre....

18:48.260 --> 18:51.260
- Here's your mail.
- Oh, dandy. My French vogue came.

18:51.597 --> 18:53.631
Read it to me, cover to cover.

18:53.632 --> 18:56.467
You,re just gonna make fun of me
,cause I can't speak French.

18:56.468 --> 18:59.468
This is so humiliating.
Can't you just have sex with me?

18:59.571 --> 19:02.571
Steven, I could be having sex with you right now.
You,d be too dumb to know it.

19:03.876 --> 19:06.177
That's it.
I,m gonna go lay down.

19:08.247 --> 19:11.247
What would you like to lay down?
A tray?

19:11.517 --> 19:14.517
,Cause you don't lay down.
You lie down.

19:14.720 --> 19:17.388
You must be from a family of morons.

19:17.389 --> 19:20.389
Probably comes from daddy
passing on his defective chromosomes.

19:21.693 --> 19:24.128
Do you even know
what a chromosome is?

19:24.129 --> 19:26.564
,Cause you,ve got,
like, nine extra ones!

19:31.603 --> 19:33.704
- Don't talk about my dad that way.
- Ow!

19:33.705 --> 19:36.140
- Just because he doesn't know
everything, doesn't- - Aaah!

19:36.141 --> 19:37.508
mean-

19:37.509 --> 19:40.509
- he's... stupid.
- Oh!

19:41.246 --> 19:44.246
Hey, Roger. Get this. Beauregard,
the greyhound-riding half man-

19:44.783 --> 19:47.783
His middle name is Lawrence.
What a freak.

19:53.592 --> 19:56.093
I don't think
I,m gonna make it, Steve.

19:56.094 --> 19:59.094
My one regret
is not watching enough television.

20:02.701 --> 20:05.701
- Steve, where are we going?
- We,re going home.

20:06.104 --> 20:09.104
- You,re gonna be okay, Roger.
- Thanks, old friend.

20:12.511 --> 20:15.511
Get your whore jacket off me.

20:18.417 --> 20:21.118
That's $2,000.
We,re going to Rome!

20:21.119 --> 20:24.119
Thank God for eBay and Steve's prized collection
of death masks of the Little Rascals.

20:25.991 --> 20:27.992
Steve!

20:27.993 --> 20:30.561
- Steve! We thought you were dead!
- What about me?

20:30.562 --> 20:33.562
- We thought you were dead too.
- Dad, I said some pretty mean things to you, and I,m sorry.

20:36.001 --> 20:39.001
That's okay. Irregardless,
I,m glad to have you home, Son.

20:39.705 --> 20:42.705
Irregardless,
I,m glad to be home too.

20:43.308 --> 20:46.308
I,m not. I hate this place.
Good night!

20:46.745 --> 20:49.213
The doctor said it would be a miracle...

20:49.214 --> 20:51.582
if Arnie lived
past a year and a half.

20:51.583 --> 20:53.751
Well, he just turned two.

20:53.752 --> 20:56.752
Mama's gone,
and so is the tree house.

20:56.788 --> 20:59.323
- But we can go anywhere.
- Come on, Gilbert.

21:08.400 --> 21:11.400
We can go anywhere.
