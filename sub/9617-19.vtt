00:10.177 --> 00:11.844

00:11.846 --> 00:13.579
How much do you

00:13.581 --> 00:15.314

No.

00:23.424 --> 00:25.324
Then what good

00:25.326 --> 00:27.192
I'm no good.

00:27.194 --> 00:29.828
Cheerleading tryouts

00:31.932 --> 00:34.400
I have better control
of my body now,

00:34.402 --> 00:36.535
And when my brain tells
my arms and legs
what to do,

00:36.537 --> 00:38.670
They try real hard now.

00:39.607 --> 00:41.740
This is gonna be

Great job, samantha.

01:56.650 --> 01:58.650
-Thanks!
-You're the best.

01:58.652 --> 02:01.019
She's the worst one here.

02:01.021 --> 02:02.788
She's the worst?

02:02.790 --> 02:04.723
Samantha's the one
i gotta beat
to make the team.

02:04.725 --> 02:06.291
I'm better than her,
right?

02:06.293 --> 02:08.327
Explain to me
what's the matter
with you.

02:09.396 --> 02:11.396
I'm for your
entertainment pleasure.

02:11.398 --> 02:12.898
How many years
you gonna do this to me?

02:12.900 --> 02:14.683
What am i doing to you?

02:14.684 --> 02:16.467
Every year i have to
tell you that you're good.
You know what?

02:16.470 --> 02:18.437
You're not good.
You're not as good
as samantha.

02:18.439 --> 02:20.606
You're not as good as heather.
You're not as good as any girl

02:20.608 --> 02:22.407
With any name,
or doesn't have a name,

02:22.409 --> 02:24.309
Or doesn't exist,
or is a rock.

02:25.846 --> 02:28.380
Well i don't like that
she doesn't have a name.

02:28.382 --> 02:30.682
I would call her roxie.

02:33.387 --> 02:35.421
Every year, you try out.

02:35.422 --> 02:37.456
Every year, coach kelly
tells you not to come back
because she hates you.

02:37.458 --> 02:38.490
Coach kelly
does not hate me.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.726
Matthews, i hate you.

02:40.728 --> 02:41.894
Why would you come here?

02:41.896 --> 02:43.428
Why are you wearing that?

02:43.430 --> 02:45.047
Why would you come here?

02:45.048 --> 02:46.665
This is the year
i'm going to make
the team.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.500
It's really not.

02:48.501 --> 02:50.334
You've been trying
to make this team since
third grade pee wees,

02:50.337 --> 02:53.038
And they don't let me
reject anybody in
third grade pee wees.

02:53.040 --> 02:55.407
It hurts their self-esteem.

02:56.477 --> 02:58.343
Then why did you
get to reject me?

02:58.345 --> 03:00.345
'cause that's the year
we passed the riley rule.

03:00.347 --> 03:02.347
(gasps)
i have my own rule.

03:03.484 --> 03:06.018
How much rejection
can you take?

03:06.020 --> 03:09.121
Hey, lebron james was cut
from his high school
basketball team.

03:09.123 --> 03:11.757
Lebron went straight to
the nba from high school.

03:11.759 --> 03:13.492
I new it was something.

03:16.363 --> 03:18.363
Coach kelly, i'm gonna
win you over.

03:18.365 --> 03:20.832
-Stay out of sports.
-Oh, you.

03:22.937 --> 03:25.904
"cheerleading tryouts
will span three days
after school.

03:25.906 --> 03:28.407
"on day one, applicants
will be judged
on coordination."

03:28.409 --> 03:29.875
-Do i have that?
-No.

03:29.877 --> 03:31.710
"day two, tumbling."

03:31.712 --> 03:33.579
-I tumble.
-Not on purpose.

03:34.548 --> 03:35.847
"and if you make it
to day three,

03:35.849 --> 03:37.482
"we will see how you
dance with the team."

03:37.484 --> 03:38.517
That i can do.

03:38.519 --> 03:40.085
If you make it
to day three.

03:41.088 --> 03:42.521
Cheerleaders:
Give me a "q,"
give me a "u,"

03:42.523 --> 03:44.890
Give me a
i-n-c-y,
quincy!

03:44.892 --> 03:48.026
Quincy,
we can fly!

03:48.028 --> 03:49.494
Whoo!

03:53.400 --> 03:54.950
(whistle blows)

03:54.951 --> 03:56.501
All right, ladies,
i've got 13 trying out.

03:56.503 --> 03:58.570
I need 12.
Matthews,

03:58.572 --> 04:01.006
Why don't you make it
easy on all of us
and quit right now,

04:01.008 --> 04:03.575
So we don't have to
go through three days
of torture?

04:03.577 --> 04:05.177
No, thank you.

04:05.179 --> 04:07.446
Riley.

04:09.183 --> 04:10.816
Know why nobody else
is even trying out?

04:10.818 --> 04:12.084
She already has her team.

04:12.086 --> 04:13.752
These are the same girls
since pee wees.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.654
These girls are the reason
you don't make the team.

04:19.660 --> 04:21.827
May we get started,
please?

04:21.829 --> 04:23.462
You heard her.

04:23.464 --> 04:26.431
Launch, fly, catch.
Team, launch.

04:26.433 --> 04:28.967
Jenkins, fly.
Matthews, catch.

04:30.137 --> 04:31.837
Catch!

04:38.145 --> 04:40.612
Hi.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.148
Oh, catch.

04:45.486 --> 04:46.451
You alive, jenkins?

04:46.453 --> 04:47.786
Jenkins:
I'm fine, coach.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.454
I'm fine, coach!

04:49.456 --> 04:50.522
All right,
let's try that again.

04:50.524 --> 04:53.091
Matthews, you fly.
Jenkins, you catch.

04:56.497 --> 04:57.613
Can i trust you?

04:57.614 --> 04:58.730
Oh, yeah. I know exactly
what i'm gonna do.

04:59.867 --> 05:01.500
I'm gonna die!

05:07.875 --> 05:09.541
Who invented this?

05:09.543 --> 05:11.643
Thomas edison,
the wizard of menlo park.

05:11.645 --> 05:12.644
After how many tries?

05:12.646 --> 05:14.046
-Six!
-No!

05:15.082 --> 05:17.749
Anybody here think he
invented it after
his first try?

05:17.751 --> 05:19.117
-I do!
-No!

05:19.119 --> 05:20.952
All right, i was
trying something,

05:20.954 --> 05:23.021
And now i'm going back
to the way things were.

05:25.492 --> 05:27.592
Why didn't he invent
the light bulb on
his first try?

05:27.594 --> 05:28.860
'cause it was dark!

05:29.930 --> 05:31.496
Got your back.
Got your back.

05:36.203 --> 05:38.136
Did the best
i could.

05:39.606 --> 05:40.939
I'm fine.

05:40.941 --> 05:42.641
Nothing to see, here.

05:42.643 --> 05:43.842
Go on with your business.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.143
Uh, but wouldn't the ice
work better

05:45.145 --> 05:47.212
If you put it
on something?

05:49.783 --> 05:51.783
I see.

05:51.785 --> 05:53.618
You were supposed to
talk her out of this.

05:53.620 --> 05:55.520
Every year, riley
tries out for cheerleaders.

05:55.522 --> 05:57.789
Oh, riley, you are
no cheerleader.

05:57.791 --> 06:00.125
That is a terrible thing
to say to me, zay.

06:00.127 --> 06:02.094
I meant it
as a compliment.

06:02.096 --> 06:05.530
Back in texas, zay had
a little incident
with a cheerleader.

06:05.532 --> 06:07.632
It wasn't just
a little incident.

06:07.634 --> 06:11.069
It was true love,
but i'm over it now.

06:11.071 --> 06:12.738
Vanessa!

06:13.741 --> 06:15.173
Matthews, you're her father.

06:15.175 --> 06:17.893
It's your job to
talk her out of this.

06:17.894 --> 06:20.612
Thomas edison saw the need
for a new kind of light source
for the home.

06:20.614 --> 06:23.048
See, people relied on
kerosene lanterns,

06:23.050 --> 06:25.283
And he tried a lot more
than six ways

06:25.285 --> 06:27.719
To come up with
an electric light
without success.

06:28.689 --> 06:30.689
-You know what he said?
-"i have failed!"

06:32.693 --> 06:34.259
-No!
-Yeah!

06:36.730 --> 06:38.697
"i have not failed.

06:38.699 --> 06:40.932
"i've just found 10,000 ways
that will not work."

06:40.934 --> 06:42.734
But edison
finally succeeded.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.686
That's why we have
light in here.

06:44.687 --> 06:46.637
-Because he never gave up.
-And neither should i.

06:46.640 --> 06:49.107
Mmm, way to put her
back on track, matthews.

06:49.109 --> 06:51.076
Why'd you have to pick today
to teach us about edison?

06:51.078 --> 06:53.044
Yeah, that's something,
isn't it?

06:53.046 --> 06:56.114
Okay, when we were at home,
you didn't want her to do this.
Nobody did.

06:56.116 --> 06:57.682
Yeah, because
as her father,

06:57.684 --> 06:59.985
I've gone through this
with her half a dozen times.

06:59.987 --> 07:01.853
And it kills me every year.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.355
Then what are you doing?

07:05.659 --> 07:07.592
In this room,
i'm your teacher.

07:12.666 --> 07:15.167
You've made it to day two?

07:15.169 --> 07:16.601
-Yeah!
-Whoo!

07:16.603 --> 07:18.603
And you brought your own
cheering section?

07:18.605 --> 07:19.971
I'm just here to
pick up the pieces.

07:19.973 --> 07:21.640
I'm here because
i wanna see this.

07:21.642 --> 07:23.392
I'm here because
i believe in riley.

07:23.393 --> 07:25.143
I'm here because i need to
show my cheerleader enemies

07:25.145 --> 07:26.778
They have
no hold on me.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.313
Hi, zay.

07:28.315 --> 07:31.716
(giggles)
you know my name.

07:32.853 --> 07:34.786
I hold in my hand,

07:34.788 --> 07:36.154
A bell.

07:36.156 --> 07:37.689
This is the riley bell.

07:37.691 --> 07:39.624
I have my own bell.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.827
When you quit,
and you will,

07:41.829 --> 07:45.130
You will ring this bell,
and this travesty will be over.

07:45.132 --> 07:48.233
-I will never
ring that bell.
-Uh-huh.

07:48.235 --> 07:50.953
Day two, tumbling.

07:50.954 --> 07:53.672
This is the day we learn
what kind of control you have
over your bodies.

07:54.741 --> 07:57.075
-Maya.
-I want you to live.

07:59.413 --> 08:04.416
All right, ladies. Round off,
back handspring, yamashida.
Stick the landing.

08:05.352 --> 08:08.053
-Lucas!
-Yamashida, man.

08:08.055 --> 08:11.289
All right, ladies.
Show her how it's done.

08:15.796 --> 08:17.996
Fair.

08:24.771 --> 08:26.705
What was that?

08:26.707 --> 08:27.906
Hi, there.

08:27.908 --> 08:29.942
Did i see
a little something?

08:29.943 --> 08:31.977
-No.
-You sure, jenkins? You sure
i didn't see a little--

08:31.979 --> 08:34.012
-No, no, no, no.
-Eh, eh, eh, eh,

08:34.014 --> 08:35.747
-No, no.
-Eh.

08:35.749 --> 08:36.815
Give me your foot.

08:36.817 --> 08:37.916
I don't want to
give you my foot.

08:37.918 --> 08:41.853
(speaks russian),
jenkins.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.121
I'm sorry.

08:44.992 --> 08:46.691
Matthews.

08:47.828 --> 08:50.161
-Farkle!
<i>-Nyet!</i>

08:58.171 --> 09:00.872
What are you doing?
That's my donut!

09:04.912 --> 09:06.111
Tumble.

09:13.220 --> 09:14.486
Okay.

09:17.324 --> 09:18.757
You ready for me now,
champ?

09:18.759 --> 09:20.859
-Yeah.
-You get two attempts.

09:20.861 --> 09:22.928
That wasn't twice?

09:22.930 --> 09:26.097
Wanna show us what you can do,
or you wanna ring that bell?

09:38.345 --> 09:40.011
Goodbye.

09:41.114 --> 09:42.247
All: Goodbye.

09:47.821 --> 09:49.888
(yells)

09:59.833 --> 10:01.399
All you had to do,
was ring the bell.

10:01.401 --> 10:03.835
Did you ring the bell?
No.

10:03.837 --> 10:05.770
We rang the bell for you.

10:05.772 --> 10:07.872
Was that good enough?
No.

10:08.809 --> 10:10.775
Well, i have never been
more proud of you.

10:10.777 --> 10:12.344
You made it through day two
without ringing the bell.

10:12.346 --> 10:14.446
No one expects you
in school today, okay?

10:14.448 --> 10:16.381
So we'll see you
when you're back in one piece.

10:16.383 --> 10:18.149
What's the matter
with you?

10:18.151 --> 10:19.851
Ring the bell.

10:19.853 --> 10:21.086
Ring any bell.
Ring the doorbell.

10:21.088 --> 10:23.321
I'll go tell coach kelly
you rang the bell,

10:23.323 --> 10:25.323
And we can all wake up
from this horrible nightmare.

10:26.927 --> 10:28.793
Is she alive?

10:29.863 --> 10:31.262
Did she make it
through the night?

10:31.264 --> 10:33.498
Riley, we are
so proud of you.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.567
Is she alive?

10:35.569 --> 10:37.869
Please, stop now.
We all want you to stop.

10:37.871 --> 10:39.471
Is-- is she alive?

10:40.874 --> 10:42.107
Tell her, zay.

10:42.109 --> 10:43.341
Zay?

10:43.343 --> 10:45.594
So, what?

10:45.595 --> 10:47.846
You guys just
break into her apartment,
and that's appropriate?

10:49.916 --> 10:51.449
Riley, are you alive?

10:51.451 --> 10:52.884
No one can get an answer.

10:52.886 --> 10:55.420
All of you? All of you
just come in here?

10:55.422 --> 10:57.022
That's what i'm saying.

10:58.325 --> 10:59.958
She can't even move.

10:59.960 --> 11:02.160
This is on you,
matthews.

11:02.161 --> 11:04.361
-Why is that, maya?
-'cause you're talking out of
both sides of your head.

11:04.364 --> 11:05.864
At home, you tell her to quit,

11:05.866 --> 11:07.332
At school, you teach
her to never give up.

11:07.334 --> 11:10.335
What? Her teacher
and her father disagree?

11:10.337 --> 11:12.470
Well, maybe it's that they
both want what's best for her.

11:12.472 --> 11:15.340
Wait, which one of you
do you hope she listens to?

11:15.342 --> 11:17.976
Here? I want her to
listen to her father.

11:17.978 --> 11:19.177
Her father
wants to protect her.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.046
Her father wants her
in this bed

11:21.048 --> 11:22.947
All day where nothing bad
can happen to her.

11:22.949 --> 11:24.616
Quit, riley.

11:24.618 --> 11:26.284
Your father doesn't want you
to get hurt.

11:26.286 --> 11:27.852
What does her teacher want?

11:29.289 --> 11:31.022
Her teacher wants
the same thing everyday.

11:32.059 --> 11:34.225
He wants her to
have an education.

11:34.227 --> 11:36.127
To learn about the world.

11:36.129 --> 11:37.495
To find out who she is.

11:37.497 --> 11:40.532
And her dad doesn't want her
to find out who she is?

11:40.534 --> 11:42.534
No, no!

11:44.638 --> 11:47.505
Zay, i don't blame you for
not wanting to be
a part of this insanity.

11:47.507 --> 11:49.074
Thank you.

11:49.076 --> 11:51.109
It's much worse
than you think, actually.

11:51.111 --> 11:53.228
Why?

11:53.229 --> 11:55.346
Well, i wouldn't do this
without an invitation,
but, uh...

11:56.883 --> 11:58.083
I was raised
better than you,

11:59.453 --> 12:01.019
And apparently
smarter than you,

12:01.021 --> 12:02.887
But this could
go on all day.

12:06.426 --> 12:08.893
Looks like she listened
to her teacher.

12:17.003 --> 12:18.503
Coach kelly!

12:18.505 --> 12:20.939
Matthews, still standing?

12:20.941 --> 12:23.241
I came early.
It's just you and me.

12:23.243 --> 12:24.509
Give me the
inspirational speech.

12:24.511 --> 12:26.044
Give you the what now?

12:26.046 --> 12:27.946
The team isn't here.

12:27.948 --> 12:29.247
Show me who you
really are, jackie.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.682
Jackie?

12:30.684 --> 12:32.984
Give me my speech.
Help me do better.

12:32.986 --> 12:34.352
Matthews,

12:34.354 --> 12:37.021
These girls are finely tuned
precision instruments

12:37.023 --> 12:39.491
Who have dedicated
their entire lives to this.

12:39.493 --> 12:41.359
You are a pineapple.

12:42.996 --> 12:44.329
I'm going to
hug you, now.

12:44.331 --> 12:45.797
Don't you come near me.

12:45.798 --> 12:47.264
Do you think these girls
think of anything else?

12:48.935 --> 12:51.369
What is this, samantha?
Sloppy day?

12:52.606 --> 12:54.105
I'll do better, coach.

13:01.681 --> 13:03.348
You have invaded
my personal space.

13:03.350 --> 13:06.251
And you have invaded
my heart, coach kelly.

13:06.253 --> 13:08.686
You and i both know that
i am going to be a cheerleader.

13:08.688 --> 13:11.289
That is what you want from me,
and i know your true soul.

13:11.291 --> 13:12.390
What's happening?

13:12.392 --> 13:14.392
Coach kelly, launch.
Matthews, fly.

13:14.394 --> 13:15.994
-Who's catching?
-It's a surprise!

13:15.996 --> 13:17.462
Oh, i love surprises.

13:17.464 --> 13:20.265
I'm gonna die!

13:23.069 --> 13:26.437
Incredibly, welcome
to day three.

13:28.108 --> 13:30.375
I can't believe this,
but how much are you
rooting for her right now?

13:30.377 --> 13:31.509
As much as always.

13:31.511 --> 13:33.278
Guys, you know
how this ends.

13:33.280 --> 13:34.746
How could we let it
get this far?

13:34.748 --> 13:36.181
Don't you even know
your best friend?

13:36.183 --> 13:37.215
There's no stopping her.

13:37.217 --> 13:38.416
Yes, i know
my best friend,

13:38.418 --> 13:40.352
And i don't want
my best friend
to get hurt.

13:40.353 --> 13:42.287
Well, maya, she's
always there for us.
It's our turn now.

13:42.289 --> 13:44.255
Yeah, we shouldn't stop her
from doing what she wants.

13:44.257 --> 13:45.990
We just need to be here
when she needs us.

13:45.992 --> 13:47.625
You're right.

13:47.627 --> 13:49.494
I know you're right.
I just...

13:49.496 --> 13:51.880
I don't want her
to fail.

13:51.881 --> 13:54.265
And if she does, you'll be
the first person she wants
to put an arm around her.

13:54.267 --> 13:56.668
Okay, i'm not going
anywhere.

13:56.670 --> 13:59.270
This is our
choreographed routine
that we have perfected

13:59.272 --> 14:02.006
Over all our years together.
Newcomer.

14:02.008 --> 14:03.474
Have you learned
the steps?

14:03.476 --> 14:05.276
-(very loudly) yes, coach!
-Wow.

14:05.278 --> 14:07.011
I was about to say,
"i can't hear ya,"

14:07.013 --> 14:08.012
But you got me.

14:08.014 --> 14:10.048
Okay, places, everybody.

14:13.787 --> 14:16.554
(music plays)

15:26.226 --> 15:28.192
Okay.

15:29.663 --> 15:31.195
"riley matthews?"

15:32.332 --> 15:34.132
I'm the only one
who made the team?

15:35.468 --> 15:37.201
No, honey.

15:37.203 --> 15:38.803
That's not what
that means.

15:40.507 --> 15:41.673
Oh.

15:43.209 --> 15:44.709
I'm really tired, maya.

15:44.711 --> 15:46.477
I know you are, riles.

15:47.614 --> 15:48.746
You did great.

15:49.683 --> 15:50.882
Wanna go home?

15:50.884 --> 15:52.483
Yeah.

16:19.279 --> 16:20.511
Come in.

16:20.513 --> 16:24.315
I'm very sorry for
what happened to you, riley,

16:24.317 --> 16:26.250
And i'm proud of you
for trying your best.

16:26.252 --> 16:28.753
And i'm glad that
you're still alive.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.256
Thanks, auggie.

16:32.258 --> 16:34.492
And thank you, mom,
for sitting with me.

16:34.494 --> 16:37.295
Aw, thank you for being
who you are.

16:38.598 --> 16:40.198
Where's dad?

16:40.200 --> 16:41.666
He left for school
a long time ago.

16:42.869 --> 16:44.335
Is he disappointed in me?

16:44.337 --> 16:46.504
Of course not.

16:46.506 --> 16:50.241
I think he just really wants
to be your teacher right now.

17:03.189 --> 17:04.322
New day?

17:05.325 --> 17:06.424
Absolutely.

17:15.502 --> 17:16.868
Mr. Matthews?

17:16.870 --> 17:18.903
Yes, ms. Matthews?

17:18.905 --> 17:20.905
You got something for me?

17:20.907 --> 17:23.574
Because i'm asking
my teacher.

17:23.576 --> 17:25.243
'cause i've had
a rough few days.

17:26.646 --> 17:30.615
"i have not failed,
i've just found 10,000 ways
that will not work."

17:35.688 --> 17:38.356
Thomas edison couldn't
hold a job when he was young,

17:38.358 --> 17:40.391
And no one thought he would
amount much to anything.

17:41.327 --> 17:43.728
Thomas edison never made it
as an inventor...

17:43.730 --> 17:45.229
Until he did.

17:46.332 --> 17:49.434
Only you get to decide
when you quit.

17:50.804 --> 17:52.904
No well intended friend,

17:52.906 --> 17:56.240
No parent who's only trying
to protect you,

17:56.242 --> 17:58.543
And no teacher, who's supposed
to bring out the best in you,

17:58.545 --> 18:01.512
Can make you turn
your back on something
you're passionate about.

18:02.582 --> 18:05.516
Because a teacher
who brings you to failure,

18:05.518 --> 18:07.285
Who wants you to quit,

18:08.421 --> 18:09.987
Who hasn't taught
you anything,

18:11.357 --> 18:14.992
Is... No teacher at all.

18:16.729 --> 18:18.362
But my name was
on the paper.

18:18.364 --> 18:19.831
Did you quit?

18:20.967 --> 18:23.434
I didn't ring the bell.
I couldn't. It was gone.

18:23.436 --> 18:24.368
I stole it.

18:26.306 --> 18:28.372
Maya, you stole the bell?

18:29.742 --> 18:33.377
Did you think any of us
were gonna let you
ring this bell?

18:34.814 --> 18:36.347
Riley,

18:36.349 --> 18:38.416
If you let somebody
make you quit,

18:38.418 --> 18:41.986
No matter what
position of power
that person is in,

18:41.988 --> 18:44.455
If you only try
9,000 times,

18:45.725 --> 18:47.291
You just end up
sitting in the dark.

18:49.429 --> 18:50.928
Do you want to
sit in the dark, riley?

19:02.442 --> 19:04.842
Thank you,
mr. Matthews.

19:04.844 --> 19:06.878
Anytime.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.454
Oh, my poor,
little girl.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.432
Matthews.

19:30.436 --> 19:31.669
What are you doing here?

19:31.671 --> 19:34.438
I want to be on
the cheerleading team.

19:34.440 --> 19:37.108
-You didn't make it.
-Just because you say
i didn't make the team,

19:37.110 --> 19:38.509
Doesn't mean
i didn't make the team.

19:38.511 --> 19:40.812
Yeah, it does.

19:40.813 --> 19:43.114
It's actually the thing that
determines who's on the team,
and you.

19:43.116 --> 19:46.083
Because i say,
"you're not good enough."

19:47.420 --> 19:49.120
I want to be on
the cheerleading team.

19:49.122 --> 19:50.888
-As what?
-You need 12.

19:50.890 --> 19:53.391
What if one of your girls
gets hurt? I could be
an alternate.

19:53.393 --> 19:55.760
My girls don't get hurt.
They're machines.

19:57.497 --> 19:59.697
-Ow.
-'scuse me?

19:59.699 --> 20:01.733
Ow.

20:01.734 --> 20:03.768
Put that one hop little leg
back on the ground, jenkins.

20:08.608 --> 20:10.675
-Ow.
-What?

20:10.677 --> 20:12.143
Cut it out, samantha.

20:12.145 --> 20:14.145
Jenkins, she didn't even know
how to catch you.

20:14.147 --> 20:16.514
She hasn't been coached
like we have.

20:16.516 --> 20:18.482
Yeah, maybe if
you coached her.

20:18.484 --> 20:19.784
Why are you doing this?

20:19.786 --> 20:21.485
Why would you
encourage her like this?

20:21.487 --> 20:22.720
We're cheerleaders.

20:22.722 --> 20:25.423
We know spirit
when we see it.

20:28.895 --> 20:30.795
I think you're
gonna need this.

20:33.967 --> 20:35.499
Matthews...

20:39.505 --> 20:41.105
You finally broke me.

20:42.575 --> 20:45.009
(cheering)

20:54.721 --> 20:57.455
Uh, you guys may want
to see this.

20:57.457 --> 20:58.923
Oh, whatcha got there, aug?

21:01.427 --> 21:03.494
This is perez hilton.

21:03.496 --> 21:06.497
Mostly, i write about
the rich and famous,

21:06.499 --> 21:09.467
But today i think
you'll find inspiration

21:09.469 --> 21:11.569
In the talentless
and clumsy.

21:11.571 --> 21:13.070
I'm both.

21:14.474 --> 21:17.441
How long have you
been trying to make the
cheerleading team, riley?

21:17.443 --> 21:18.876
All my life, perez.

21:18.878 --> 21:21.912
And where is the coach
who finally caved in?

21:21.914 --> 21:23.581
Outta my face, hilton.

21:24.450 --> 21:26.117
Feisty.

21:26.119 --> 21:30.688
This is a story
about a little girl
who wouldn't give up,

21:30.690 --> 21:34.158
And won the admiration
of her teammates.

21:35.762 --> 21:38.996
(music plays)

21:46.806 --> 21:48.472
Okay.

21:48.474 --> 21:50.574
I think i see
what we got here.

21:51.511 --> 21:54.111
I couldn't have done this
without my old friends.

21:57.183 --> 21:59.583
Or my new friends.

22:04.123 --> 22:07.525
So, dream your dreams,
little ones,

22:07.527 --> 22:09.527
Because this is a world

22:09.529 --> 22:11.662
Where nothing is impossible.

22:11.664 --> 22:13.130
And isn't that
the kind of world

22:13.132 --> 22:14.565
You want to live in?
