WEBVTT

00:02.103 --> 00:04.272
(grand orchestral fanfare
playing)

00:26.194 --> 00:28.262
*

00:57.391 --> 00:59.293
(water burbling)

00:59.327 --> 01:01.429
*

01:03.131 --> 01:07.067
GRANDMAMAH:
The ocean
is a mysterious world.

01:07.101 --> 01:11.139
One that land dwellers
can only begin to imagine.

01:11.172 --> 01:14.908
Of course, you think you know
what lies beneath the surface.

01:14.942 --> 01:16.944
Ah, but the sea creatures
who live there,

01:16.977 --> 01:20.281
well, even the ones
you have imagined,

01:20.314 --> 01:22.950
you've imagined them wrong.

01:22.983 --> 01:26.554
Take the mythical,
mighty giant kraken.

01:26.587 --> 01:27.955
Bloodthirsty monster,

01:27.988 --> 01:30.491
sinker of ships,
drowner of sailors.

01:30.524 --> 01:31.925
(laughing)

01:31.959 --> 01:33.761
That's what you people think.

01:33.794 --> 01:39.133
You see, in real life,
krakens are noble protectors.

01:39.167 --> 01:42.303
The sea will always need
a kraken,

01:42.336 --> 01:47.441
and a kraken will always
answer the call.

01:47.475 --> 01:49.810
(quacking ringtone)

01:49.843 --> 01:50.778
* We can take turns...

01:50.811 --> 01:51.779
GIRL:
Ruby-doo.

01:51.812 --> 01:52.946
Hey, Margot.

01:52.980 --> 01:54.182
MARGOT:
I am dying of suspense.

01:54.215 --> 01:55.616
-(yawns)
-What did your mom say?

01:55.649 --> 01:57.318
Well, I chickened out
last night,

01:57.351 --> 01:59.520
but I'm going to ask her now,
right now, this second.

01:59.553 --> 02:01.155
MARGOT: Did you do
the confidence-building

02:01.189 --> 02:02.356
exercise I taught you?

02:02.390 --> 02:04.124
RUBY:
I did something even better.

02:04.158 --> 02:07.295
* We'll never cave
or we'll never waver *

02:07.328 --> 02:09.497
*

02:09.530 --> 02:14.034
* And we'll always become
braver and braver *

02:15.369 --> 02:17.037
* We'll dance
like nobody's there *

02:17.070 --> 02:19.173
* We'll dance
without any cares *

02:19.207 --> 02:21.008
* We'll talk 'bout problems
we share *

02:21.041 --> 02:22.810
* We'll talk 'bout things
that ain't fair *

02:22.843 --> 02:24.212
* We'll sing 'bout things
we don't know *

02:24.245 --> 02:25.979
* We'll sing to people
and show *

02:26.013 --> 02:27.848
* What it means to be young

02:27.881 --> 02:29.617
* And growing up.

02:29.650 --> 02:30.984
(song ends)

02:31.018 --> 02:33.221
Oh, hey. (clears throat)

02:33.254 --> 02:37.024
Junior prom is the sacred rite
of every human teenager.

02:37.057 --> 02:39.159
As a kraken who is barely
pulling off

02:39.193 --> 02:40.628
this whole human thing,

02:40.661 --> 02:43.531
I need to be there
so that I can blend in.

02:43.564 --> 02:45.233
And, as a proud mathlete,

02:45.266 --> 02:47.067
I know that to find
a potential solution,

02:47.100 --> 02:49.002
I have to evaluate the problem.

02:49.036 --> 02:50.471
Now, I know the rules.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.806
Our family is not allowed
in the ocean, ever.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.074
For any reason.

02:54.107 --> 02:55.676
And I love rules.

02:55.709 --> 02:57.211
I do. I really, really do.

02:57.245 --> 03:00.381
But the prom boat
is on the water,

03:00.414 --> 03:02.049
-not in the water.
-(thunder crashing)

03:02.082 --> 03:04.385
"What if there's a storm?"
you might ask.

03:04.418 --> 03:06.053
Well, I've analyzed
weather trend data,

03:06.086 --> 03:08.489
and my trusty friend,
the Internet,

03:08.522 --> 03:11.359
has assured me that it will be
smooth sailing on prom night.

03:11.392 --> 03:15.663
And lastly, this is the captain
of said prom boat.

03:15.696 --> 03:17.265
Look into those eyes.

03:17.298 --> 03:19.233
Tell me he hasn't seen it all.

03:19.267 --> 03:21.569
I trust him with my life,
and so should you.

03:21.602 --> 03:24.071
And that is why I,
Ruby Gillman,

03:24.104 --> 03:25.739
should go to prom. Thank you.

03:25.773 --> 03:28.576
Please, please, please,
please, please!

03:28.609 --> 03:30.110
Strong presentation.

03:30.143 --> 03:31.845
I like the energy,
but it's still a no, honey.

03:31.879 --> 03:34.782
But, Mom, evidence,
science, Internet.

03:34.815 --> 03:37.251
Trust me, Ruby,
I know what's best for you.

03:37.285 --> 03:39.553
And what's best
is to always stay on land.

03:39.587 --> 03:40.554
That's why we moved here.

03:40.588 --> 03:42.022
It's much safer for us.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.724
Sorry, Tadpole, Mom's right.

03:43.757 --> 03:45.759
MOM:
Sam, breakfast!

03:45.793 --> 03:48.296
Hey, didn't you say
that prom was a postbolognal...

03:48.329 --> 03:50.364
Postcolonial
patriarchal construct. It is.

03:50.398 --> 03:52.065
But we would go as a group.

03:52.099 --> 03:53.301
As a form of protest.

03:53.334 --> 03:55.436
Wow. So brave.

03:55.469 --> 03:57.938
What do you think?
I had these printed
for my big launch party.

03:57.971 --> 03:59.640
I think I'm in love.

03:59.673 --> 04:02.443
-Blech.
-Do you still
need me to be there?

04:02.476 --> 04:03.777
Yes. This is a make-or-break
moment.

04:03.811 --> 04:05.646
I'm selling
an entire development.

04:05.679 --> 04:06.714
But, Mom, you're...

04:06.747 --> 04:07.715
Agatha Gillman,

04:07.748 --> 04:09.483
and I slay the competition.

04:09.517 --> 04:12.019
She got us our dream home,
and I'm not asking how.

04:13.987 --> 04:15.823
Well, I just want
to show potential buyers

04:15.856 --> 04:18.292
what a happy Oceanside family
looks like.

04:18.326 --> 04:21.228
I'll be closing my shop for
the day so I can man the grill.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.331
From chill man to grill man.

04:23.364 --> 04:24.565
(groans)

04:24.598 --> 04:25.899
Ooh, Arthur,
you should think about

04:25.933 --> 04:27.635
hiring someone to help you.

04:27.668 --> 04:29.470
Business has been booming
since you started Bottled Up.

04:29.503 --> 04:30.671
Hey there.

04:30.704 --> 04:32.440
Welcome back to Bottled Up.

04:32.473 --> 04:35.709
Now, let's hoist those sails.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.512
Magic.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.249
Wow, you two are quite
the power couple.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.184
You think that's great?

04:44.217 --> 04:46.487
You're looking at
the undefeated dodgeball champ.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.389
-(whistle blowing)
-*

04:49.490 --> 04:50.924
-(Sam laughing)
-(kids grunting)

04:50.958 --> 04:53.093
He's a legend. Ooh.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.363
Yeah, yeah.
You guys are all crushing it.

04:55.396 --> 04:57.264
Oh, Ruby,
don't sell yourself short.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.699
You're amazing at math.

04:58.732 --> 05:00.701
I am the reason
Connor's passing algebra.

05:00.734 --> 05:01.969
SAM:
Oh, Connor.

05:02.002 --> 05:03.771
-So dreamy.
-Sam.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.373
Ow. You're the one
in love with him.

05:05.406 --> 05:07.307
-Hey, hey. Stop.
You each landed one.
-(groans)

05:07.341 --> 05:09.543
Marine Biologist Quarterly?

05:09.577 --> 05:11.845
Oh, Ruby.
You're still reading this trash?

05:11.879 --> 05:14.181
Humans don't know everything
about the ocean.

05:14.214 --> 05:15.683
Mom, there's a whole world
down there

05:15.716 --> 05:16.984
that I have never seen.

05:17.017 --> 05:18.819
Jellyfish, plankton,
coral reefs...

05:18.852 --> 05:20.954
But what else lives there?

05:20.988 --> 05:22.556
I know. Monsters.

05:22.590 --> 05:25.192
And those monsters
want to hurt krakens like us.

05:25.225 --> 05:27.961
This is where we belong.
Oceanside is our home.

05:27.995 --> 05:30.798
Then help me fit in
by letting me go to prom.

05:30.831 --> 05:33.166
Ruby, the answer is no.

05:33.200 --> 05:34.201
(squeaking)

05:34.234 --> 05:35.669
-Time to go.
-(Ruby groans)

05:35.703 --> 05:37.070
-Mom.
-Gillman dishes to Gillman.

05:37.104 --> 05:38.639
The fadeaway at the buzzer,

05:38.672 --> 05:39.673
-and it's good!
-Yeah.

05:39.707 --> 05:40.674
Woo-hoo!

05:40.708 --> 05:41.909
Limb up, everyone.

05:41.942 --> 05:44.011
Let's all have
a very human day.

05:44.044 --> 05:46.880
Does it bother you guys that we
lie to everyone all the time?

05:46.914 --> 05:49.817
Oh, we're not lying.
We're just omitting.

05:49.850 --> 05:50.918
Yeah, okay.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.420
And remember...

05:52.453 --> 05:54.922
OTHERS: If anyone asks,
we're from Canada.

05:54.955 --> 05:57.024
*

05:59.860 --> 06:01.929
(boat horns blowing)

06:04.064 --> 06:05.533
-(screams)
-(tires screeching)

06:05.566 --> 06:07.267
-(people exclaiming)
-Whoa, what's happening?

06:07.300 --> 06:09.202
-Are we supposed to be stopped?
-Is our tour over?

06:09.236 --> 06:12.406
Apologies for the unplanned
interruption, folks.

06:12.440 --> 06:15.676
Well, look what the tide
dragged in, Davey.

06:15.709 --> 06:18.412
Ahoy, Mr.--
Captain Gordon Lighthouse, sir.

06:18.446 --> 06:20.080
Aren't you one
of them Gillmans?

06:20.113 --> 06:21.114
Guilty.

06:21.148 --> 06:22.516
(laughs nervously)

06:22.550 --> 06:24.552
Just kidding. Not guilty.
Totally normal.

06:24.585 --> 06:27.521
-Is she blue?
-I'm from Canada... eh.

06:27.555 --> 06:30.023
("O Canada" playing)

06:30.057 --> 06:31.091
-Oh...
-(tourists murmuring)

06:31.124 --> 06:32.460
That totally makes sense.

06:32.493 --> 06:35.696
I've got my eye on you,
Gillman girl.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.397
And my other eye, too!

06:39.099 --> 06:41.902
(over speaker): Our tour begins
where 15 years ago,

06:41.935 --> 06:45.639
I swear I saw the monstrous
giant kraken.

06:45.673 --> 06:48.108
And to your right, Oceanside's
best saltwater taffy.

06:48.141 --> 06:50.544
-Ask for the Gordon Lighthouse
discount.
-(quacking ringtone)

06:50.578 --> 06:52.245
Hey, guys.

06:52.279 --> 06:54.214
-Yo. -Greetings.
-So, how did it go?

06:54.247 --> 06:56.249
Yes. I'm dying to find out.

06:56.283 --> 06:58.619
Same. I've been stress-gaming.

06:58.652 --> 07:00.821
Well, it's official.
Mom won't let me go to prom.

07:00.854 --> 07:02.490
And I know it's not
what we wanted,

07:02.523 --> 07:04.758
but we still have plan B,

07:04.792 --> 07:07.094
our very cool anti-prom party.

07:07.127 --> 07:09.897
And what is the most
liberated food out there?

07:09.930 --> 07:11.932
Guys, I'm talking fondue.

07:13.366 --> 07:16.737
Ruby, um, I'm just gonna
come right out and say it.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.472
Kayla asked me to the prom.

07:18.506 --> 07:20.608
-Oh.
-And, uh,

07:20.641 --> 07:21.942
I said carpe diem. (giggling)

07:21.975 --> 07:23.243
Aka, I said yes.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.812
-What?
-I said yes.

07:24.845 --> 07:28.148
No, I got that. Loud and clear.

07:30.784 --> 07:33.186
RUBY:
Okay, Margot has torn our hearts

07:33.220 --> 07:34.655
into a million tiny pieces,

07:34.688 --> 07:36.123
and that's fine.

07:36.156 --> 07:37.858
More fondue for the rest of us,
right, guys?

07:37.891 --> 07:39.359
BLISS:
Yeah, uh,

07:39.392 --> 07:41.194
once Margot was going
with Kayla,

07:41.228 --> 07:43.463
Trevin said, "Oh, well,
should we just go together?"

07:43.497 --> 07:45.198
And I agreed.

07:45.232 --> 07:47.601
So Trevin and I are going
to the prom together.

07:47.635 --> 07:49.036
As friends.

07:49.069 --> 07:50.638
(laughs nervously):
Yeah, only as friends.

07:50.671 --> 07:52.105
-(clears throat)
-RUBY: What?

07:52.139 --> 07:53.106
What?

07:53.140 --> 07:54.374
Sorry, Ruby.

07:54.407 --> 07:56.043
We promised to always
stick together.

07:56.076 --> 07:59.012
Does squad solidarity
mean nothing to you?

07:59.046 --> 08:00.848
Well, of course it does.

08:00.881 --> 08:03.116
Which is why
you should come with us.
You'll be on a boat.

08:03.150 --> 08:04.618
You'll be completely safe.

08:04.652 --> 08:06.520
Unless there's
a tragic accident.

08:06.554 --> 08:09.022
-Bliss, no catastrophizing.
-Sorry.

08:09.056 --> 08:12.292
You guys know my mom,
and that is why we made plan B.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.361
Margot, just bring Kayla
to our anti-prom party.

08:14.394 --> 08:15.996
We will watch bad movies.

08:16.029 --> 08:17.297
We'll dip Swiss.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.465
Enough with the fondue!

08:18.498 --> 08:21.168
We eat a lot of cheese.

08:21.201 --> 08:22.636
Wheels of it.

08:22.670 --> 08:24.337
Think about how many events
we've missed

08:24.371 --> 08:26.006
in squad solidarity

08:26.039 --> 08:28.508
because of your mom's
irrational anti-ocean rule.

08:28.542 --> 08:30.177
I guess a few.

08:30.210 --> 08:32.379
What? There was the field trip
to the submarine museum.

08:32.412 --> 08:34.081
The school beach day.

08:34.114 --> 08:35.883
-All-county surf contest.
-TREVIN: The Grunion Fun Run.

08:35.916 --> 08:37.417
MARGOT: The Oceanside
Festival of the Bard.

08:37.450 --> 08:38.819
BLISS: My grandmother's
beach birthday party.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.220
MARGOT:
Kayla's beach birthday party!

08:40.253 --> 08:41.655
TREVIN:
Any birthday party but Bliss's.

08:41.689 --> 08:42.856
You're always welcome
at the graveyard.

08:42.890 --> 08:45.425
But this isn't just any party.

08:45.458 --> 08:47.194
This is prom.

08:47.227 --> 08:49.096
And I really want
to be a part of it.

08:49.129 --> 08:51.198
We all do.

08:51.231 --> 08:52.866
Yeah. No, I get it.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.401
You guys should go without me.

08:54.434 --> 08:56.403
It's one thing for my mom
to ruin my life.

08:56.436 --> 08:57.938
She doesn't have to ruin yours.

08:57.971 --> 09:00.173
Uh, what if you don't tell her?

09:00.207 --> 09:01.842
Gasp of exclamation!

09:01.875 --> 09:03.844
Trevin's right.
Your mom doesn't have to know.

09:03.877 --> 09:05.913
Deception. I'm on board.

09:05.946 --> 09:07.247
Come on, Ruby. Do it.

09:07.280 --> 09:08.582
Do it.

09:08.616 --> 09:11.051
I want to,
but if my mom finds out, uh...

09:11.084 --> 09:13.120
Oh, life is not
a dress rehearsal.

09:13.153 --> 09:18.258
It's time for you to go big
and go to prom.

09:18.291 --> 09:19.526
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.729
(sighs)
You're right.

09:21.762 --> 09:23.563
Okay, I'll do it.

09:23.597 --> 09:25.833
-I'll go to prom.
-Yes!

09:27.134 --> 09:29.036
And I'm gonna ask Connor.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.604
Connor?

09:30.638 --> 09:32.072
Okay, that's a...
that's a big swing there.

09:32.105 --> 09:33.907
Whoo. But we are here for it.

09:33.941 --> 09:36.944
Step one, you're going
to need a prom-posal.

09:36.977 --> 09:38.946
Blue-sky with me, people.
Any ideas?

09:38.979 --> 09:40.748
Maybe I can ask him with
something epic,

09:40.781 --> 09:43.583
like an advanced
quadratic equation.

09:43.617 --> 09:47.120
And when I solve it,
the answer is...

09:47.154 --> 09:48.488
prom.

09:50.691 --> 09:54.394
Ruby, my sweet, wide-eyed,
dumbest smart person ever,

09:54.427 --> 09:57.230
you cannot ask Connor to prom
with homework.

09:57.264 --> 09:59.466
But look how it graphs.
It's cool.

09:59.499 --> 10:00.734
It is not cool.

10:00.768 --> 10:02.970
A good prom-posal is art.

10:03.003 --> 10:04.571
Showmanship is the name
of the game

10:04.604 --> 10:07.107
in this hormone-fueled
benchmark of adolescence.

10:07.140 --> 10:09.009
A ritual that embodies
the ultimate

10:09.042 --> 10:11.178
in high risk, high reward.

10:11.211 --> 10:13.580
-*
-Now, you get one shot at prom

10:13.613 --> 10:17.450
and one shot at persuading your
Romeo that you are his Juliet.

10:17.484 --> 10:21.121
With stakes this high,
the only option is to go big.

10:21.154 --> 10:23.957
MAN (over P.A.): Everyone,
don't forget to RSVP for prom,

10:23.991 --> 10:26.794
the most important day
of your lives.

10:26.827 --> 10:29.129
I almost asked Connor to prom
with homework.

10:29.162 --> 10:30.864
We got you, Ruby.
There are so many other options.

10:30.898 --> 10:33.834
Here, this is the first draft,
but with this script

10:33.867 --> 10:35.969
and my favorite prop
from clown school...

10:36.003 --> 10:38.105
Mm, I don't know. Do you have
something a little smaller?

10:38.138 --> 10:40.974
Tone down the drama, you say?

10:41.008 --> 10:42.375
-I know just the thing.
-What's that?

10:42.409 --> 10:44.444
A commercial-grade
DJ confetti cannon.

10:44.477 --> 10:47.314
You just ask Connor to prom,
push this button,

10:47.347 --> 10:50.483
and the confetti will rain down
like closing night on Broadway.

10:50.517 --> 10:52.686
Uh, maybe I abandon this whole

10:52.720 --> 10:54.855
"ask your dream guy
to prom" thing.

10:54.888 --> 10:56.857
("Hello" by Calabasas playing)

10:56.890 --> 10:58.358
(gasps)

11:00.060 --> 11:02.629
* I really, really wanna get
to know ya *

11:02.662 --> 11:03.864
Connor.

11:03.897 --> 11:05.866
* Hello, hello

11:05.899 --> 11:09.136
* I really, really wanna get
to know ya *

11:09.169 --> 11:10.838
* Hello, hello...

11:10.871 --> 11:13.006
Connor, would you do me
the honor

11:13.040 --> 11:15.008
of going to human prom with me?

11:15.042 --> 11:17.244
Oh, Ruby, yes.

11:17.277 --> 11:21.414
Oh, you've made me the happiest
guy on dry land, Ruby.

11:21.448 --> 11:23.751
-Connor.
-Ruby.

11:23.784 --> 11:25.853
-Ruby?
-(song slows, stops)

11:27.287 --> 11:28.889
Hi.

11:28.922 --> 11:30.523
Connor's here.

11:30.557 --> 11:33.293
Uh, yeah. Connor's here.

11:34.361 --> 11:37.230
Oh! Oh. Hi. Hi, hi, hi.

11:37.264 --> 11:38.866
(laughs):
Uh...

11:38.899 --> 11:41.401
we're still on for our tutoring
sesh later, right?

11:41.434 --> 11:42.770
Oh. (laughs)

11:42.803 --> 11:46.006
Oh, yeah, Connor.
We are on like polygons.

11:46.039 --> 11:48.341
(laughs):
All right. Team math.

11:48.375 --> 11:49.843
I'll see you later.

11:49.877 --> 11:52.279
You know it.
Anything for my alge-bae.

11:52.312 --> 11:54.181
-Your what now?
-I mean bro.

11:54.214 --> 11:55.749
A-Alge-bro.

11:55.783 --> 11:57.050
Like you're my brother.

11:57.084 --> 11:58.385
You're my math brother.

11:59.787 --> 12:02.923
You know, I think I liked
the first one better.

12:08.461 --> 12:10.097
Give me that confetti cannon.

12:10.130 --> 12:11.598
Yes!

12:11.631 --> 12:13.300
-(hyperventilating)
-CONNOR: You gotta practice.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.235
The trick is to reject
the concept of gravity.

12:15.268 --> 12:17.070
It doesn't exist.
It's not real.

12:17.104 --> 12:18.405
BOY:
All right. Peace out.

12:18.438 --> 12:20.273
CONNOR:
Yo, hit me up later.

12:23.310 --> 12:25.145
-Hey, Connor.
-Hey, Ruby.

12:25.178 --> 12:26.313
What's up?

12:26.346 --> 12:28.248
Um, hey.

12:28.281 --> 12:31.318
So, I was wondering,

12:31.351 --> 12:32.953
did you see, like,
all those prom-posals

12:32.986 --> 12:34.421
around school this morning?

12:34.454 --> 12:36.156
-Yes.
-Hmm.

12:36.189 --> 12:37.657
They kind of weird me out.

12:37.690 --> 12:39.126
Just ask someone.

12:39.159 --> 12:41.829
It doesn't have to be
this big proposal.

12:41.862 --> 12:43.130
It's crazy, right?

12:43.163 --> 12:45.833
Oh, yeah, I hear that.

12:46.867 --> 12:48.468
And besides,
prom is a postcolonial

12:48.501 --> 12:50.170
-patriarchal construct.
-Patriarchal construct.

12:50.203 --> 12:51.271
-Exactly.
-Exactly.

12:51.304 --> 12:52.539
(both chuckling)

12:53.773 --> 12:58.211
It could be fun to go
with the right person, though.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.514
Oh. (laughs nervously)

13:01.548 --> 13:03.483
Yeah. Totally.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.019
(clears throat)

13:06.053 --> 13:07.420
-Ruby... Oh.
-Connor... Oh, sorry.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.656
-Ruby... Oh, hey.
-Connor... Oh, you go.

13:09.689 --> 13:11.324
-(laughing): No, you go.
-No. You go.

13:11.358 --> 13:13.293
Yeah, no, you go. I go.

13:13.326 --> 13:16.429
Wait. Okay, no. But seriously,
what-what did you want to say?

13:16.463 --> 13:19.967
Um, Connor, I...

13:20.000 --> 13:21.634
I...

13:22.669 --> 13:24.204
-...think I'm gonna be sick.
-Whoa.

13:24.237 --> 13:25.672
Hey. Are-are you okay?

13:25.705 --> 13:27.474
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

13:27.507 --> 13:29.476
I get seasick sometimes
when I'm next to the ocean.

13:29.509 --> 13:31.111
It's genetic.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.812
You know, my sisters do this
grounding technique thing.

13:32.846 --> 13:35.282
Ooh. Whoops. Wait, what's this?

13:35.315 --> 13:37.184
-Hah. Oh. That?
Never seen that before.
-Whoa.

13:37.217 --> 13:39.552
-Is this a kaleidoscope?
-Maybe put it down. -(beeps)

13:39.586 --> 13:41.554
-(gasps)
-CANNON: It's party time!

13:41.588 --> 13:43.656
(multiple booming)

13:43.690 --> 13:45.058
-(Ruby screaming)
-(yelling)

13:45.092 --> 13:46.393
(screaming)

13:46.426 --> 13:47.494
-Connor!
-(splashing)

13:47.527 --> 13:49.129
Connor, are you okay?

13:49.162 --> 13:51.031
*

13:54.001 --> 13:55.835
Connor, grab this!

13:57.237 --> 13:58.872
Son of an anglerfish!

14:00.573 --> 14:02.542
*

14:04.211 --> 14:05.712
(whimpers)
Connor!

14:05.745 --> 14:07.948
(hyperventilating)

14:09.049 --> 14:11.851
Okay. Okay. Okay, okay,
okay, okay, okay.

14:11.885 --> 14:13.887
(screaming)

14:13.921 --> 14:15.956
*

14:37.477 --> 14:39.546
(muffled grunting)

14:51.124 --> 14:53.160
*

15:02.335 --> 15:04.304
(whooshing)

15:05.973 --> 15:08.408
*

15:20.253 --> 15:22.922
(gasping, coughing)

15:22.956 --> 15:24.992
(panting)

15:27.194 --> 15:28.395
(coughing)

15:28.428 --> 15:30.897
(sighs) What just happened?

15:30.930 --> 15:32.732
(breathing heavily)

15:32.765 --> 15:34.834
(gasps)
Connor.

15:35.969 --> 15:37.804
(crowd clamoring)

15:37.837 --> 15:39.739
-GIRL: The new girl
saved Connor.
-Connor?

15:39.772 --> 15:40.807
-GIRL 2: She's a hero.
-Connor.

15:40.840 --> 15:42.175
Ruby, there you are.

15:42.209 --> 15:43.776
You missed the story
of the year, girl.

15:43.810 --> 15:45.512
-Connor almost drowned.
-RUBY: I didn't mean to.

15:45.545 --> 15:46.980
I mean I-I didn't do it.

15:47.014 --> 15:48.515
(laughs nervously):
Gosh, that's crazy.

15:48.548 --> 15:50.317
And surprising.

15:50.350 --> 15:52.352
Because it definitely didn't
have anything to do with me.

15:52.385 --> 15:54.021
Are you feeling all right?

15:54.054 --> 15:55.788
-Why are you wet?
-(gasps)

15:55.822 --> 15:59.192
(low crowd chatter)

15:59.226 --> 16:00.960
-Connor. Are you okay?
-(coughing)

16:00.994 --> 16:02.662
Yeah. It was crazy.

16:02.695 --> 16:06.266
I just remember there was smoke
and glitter.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.301
And then the next thing I knew,

16:08.335 --> 16:10.770
I was saved by the new girl.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.205
The new girl?

16:12.239 --> 16:13.206
-*
-(crowd cheering)

16:13.240 --> 16:14.907
The new girl.

16:16.343 --> 16:18.711
-Thank you. Thank you.
-BOY: Whoo!

16:18.745 --> 16:19.846
New girl.

16:19.879 --> 16:21.281
She's going to say something.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.150
-GIRL: Shh. -(crowd quiets)
-Picture this,

16:23.183 --> 16:25.785
me, stunning but approachable,

16:25.818 --> 16:28.121
-on my first day of school.
-(giggling)

16:28.155 --> 16:29.522
I'm lost and confused,

16:29.556 --> 16:31.824
struggling to find
my first class.

16:31.858 --> 16:33.493
When suddenly-- (gasps)--

16:33.526 --> 16:36.696
I spot little mister skater boy
here barely above water.

16:36.729 --> 16:38.731
-I'm just lucky that...
-Oh.

16:38.765 --> 16:40.667
Shush, shush. Ooh. My story.

16:40.700 --> 16:44.371
Now, I'm not much of a swimmer,
but in that moment,

16:44.404 --> 16:47.674
I remembered what my mother
always told me:

16:47.707 --> 16:49.642
"You are gorgeous."

16:49.676 --> 16:52.245
Also, "Big risk, big reward.

16:52.279 --> 16:54.381
Always go big."

16:54.414 --> 16:59.319
And what is bigger
than saving a life?

16:59.352 --> 17:00.887
(cheering)

17:00.920 --> 17:03.022
Yes, queen. Get it.

17:03.056 --> 17:04.824
I love you so much.

17:04.857 --> 17:06.593
Love you, too, rando.

17:06.626 --> 17:08.428
She pointed at me. I'm Rando.

17:11.731 --> 17:13.266
Oh, no. What's happening?

17:13.300 --> 17:14.434
-Watch it.
-Ah. Excuse me.

17:14.467 --> 17:16.203
Wait.

17:16.236 --> 17:17.604
We haven't met.

17:17.637 --> 17:20.407
I'm Chelsea,
Chelsea Van Der Zee.

17:20.440 --> 17:23.376
-It's Dutch. Kusjes!
-GIRL: So exotic.

17:23.410 --> 17:24.511
GIRL 2:
I love you.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.279
-And you are?
-I'm, um...

17:26.313 --> 17:27.680
I'm Ruby Gillman.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.749
It's Canadian... eh.

17:29.782 --> 17:32.252
Okay, maybe it's the whole
"don't look at me" vibe,

17:32.285 --> 17:34.287
but there's something different
about you.

17:34.321 --> 17:36.723
I-I really gotta go now.

17:41.594 --> 17:43.796
-BOY: Uh, are you good?
-BOY 2: What's wrong with her?

17:43.830 --> 17:45.798
BOY 3: Yeah, you might need
to lie down for a little bit.

17:45.832 --> 17:47.100
BOY 2: Yeah, that's awkward.

17:47.134 --> 17:48.801
GIRL:
What's her deal?

17:48.835 --> 17:50.403
Is she gonna barf?

17:50.437 --> 17:52.439
-Freaking out.
-(whimpering)

17:52.472 --> 17:54.073
Are you okay?

17:54.107 --> 17:55.908
You really look like
you've been through something.

17:55.942 --> 17:58.811
Yeah. I really got to go. Now.

17:58.845 --> 18:01.314
MAN (over P.A.):
All right, everyone.

18:01.348 --> 18:04.417
Show's over.
Let's get back to class.

18:04.451 --> 18:06.486
(Ruby whimpering)

18:11.358 --> 18:14.294
*

18:14.327 --> 18:16.129
Welcome to your new home,

18:16.163 --> 18:17.464
if I may be so bold.

18:17.497 --> 18:19.065
-Ooh.
-This is incredible.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.967
Oh, you've picked a great place
to raise a kid.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.902
It's so safe here in Oceanside.

18:22.935 --> 18:26.639
Moving my family here was
the best decision I ever made.

18:26.673 --> 18:29.008
Doug actually grew up here.

18:29.041 --> 18:31.578
We're moving back so that
we can be closer to his folks
when the little one comes.

18:31.611 --> 18:33.246
Hello, free babysitting.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.481
(laughs nervously)

18:34.514 --> 18:35.848
How nice.

18:35.882 --> 18:37.517
Just be careful
they don't tell you

18:37.550 --> 18:39.852
how you should live your life
and raise your children.

18:39.886 --> 18:42.955
I mean, it'll be so nice
to have family nearby.

18:42.989 --> 18:45.024
You're very lucky.
(chuckles)

18:46.058 --> 18:47.494
(grunting)

18:47.527 --> 18:48.728
(yells)

18:50.363 --> 18:52.832
(whimpering)

18:52.865 --> 18:53.866
(yelps)

18:55.568 --> 18:57.170
(whimpers)

18:57.204 --> 18:59.339
(panting)

18:59.372 --> 19:00.640
Oh, why am I glowing?

19:00.673 --> 19:01.941
Glowing is not good.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.510
I will never go into
the ocean again.

19:03.543 --> 19:05.044
Lesson learned.

19:05.077 --> 19:06.446
Call Mom.

19:06.479 --> 19:07.847
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Video call Connor.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.949
What? I didn't say that.
Call Mom.

19:09.982 --> 19:11.050
-Ruby, where'd you go?
-(yelps)

19:11.083 --> 19:12.485
-Whoa. Hey.
-(Connor coughing)

19:12.519 --> 19:14.487
(whispering):
End call, end call, end call.

19:14.521 --> 19:15.655
-Wait, I wanted
to ask you some...
-I'm going through a tunnel.

19:15.688 --> 19:17.023
Call Mom.

19:17.056 --> 19:18.658
-(phone beeps)
-No, I can't call Mom.

19:18.691 --> 19:20.159
She's gonna kill me.

19:20.193 --> 19:22.929
-Mm? (yelping)
-(squishing)

19:24.497 --> 19:26.633
There's three of them?
(groans)

19:26.666 --> 19:29.236
Oh, this is a nightmare.

19:29.269 --> 19:32.305
(rumbling, clattering)

19:32.339 --> 19:33.640
No!

19:33.673 --> 19:35.208
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

19:35.242 --> 19:37.244
(screams)

19:39.846 --> 19:40.880
Hello?

19:42.048 --> 19:44.717
*

19:46.686 --> 19:47.987
Pride and Prejudice.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.689
(laughs)
You're a long way from home.

19:49.722 --> 19:52.792
What are you doing
in True Crime?

19:55.194 --> 19:57.196
*

20:06.606 --> 20:07.874
Shh.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.277
(screaming)

20:10.310 --> 20:12.111
(Ruby screaming)

20:12.144 --> 20:14.447
(both screaming)

20:15.715 --> 20:17.750
(gasping)

20:18.585 --> 20:20.620
(muffled groaning)

20:20.653 --> 20:22.622
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

20:22.655 --> 20:24.657
-(yelling)
-(glass crackling)

20:27.560 --> 20:29.128
(yelling)

20:29.161 --> 20:30.597
A lot of you have been asking
about my beard regimen.

20:30.630 --> 20:31.731
WOMAN:
Do you see that?

20:31.764 --> 20:33.232
-(gasps) Kraken!
-What is that?

20:33.266 --> 20:35.067
-Kraken ahoy! She's back!
-Oh, my goodness.

20:35.101 --> 20:36.936
Oh, she's coming for me.

20:36.969 --> 20:39.439
(yelling, gasps)

20:39.472 --> 20:41.474
(groaning)

20:45.512 --> 20:47.480
(screaming)

20:47.514 --> 20:49.616
(alarm ringing)

20:49.649 --> 20:50.750
(gasps)

20:52.118 --> 20:54.153
*

20:57.690 --> 20:58.725
(gasps)

20:58.758 --> 21:00.627
(whimpering)

21:03.363 --> 21:05.432
(heavy footsteps)

21:07.600 --> 21:09.969
-Oh. Look at this view.
-DOUG: Wow.

21:10.002 --> 21:13.172
Holy migoli, this is amazing.

21:13.205 --> 21:14.574
What do you think, boo?

21:14.607 --> 21:17.444
I think... we're sold!

21:17.477 --> 21:18.911
Oh. Fantastic.

21:18.945 --> 21:20.347
Well, I'll get
the paperwork started,

21:20.380 --> 21:21.948
and we'll make this quick
and easy

21:21.981 --> 21:23.616
so you can focus
on your little one.

21:23.650 --> 21:25.084
-I can't believe this is ours.
-Look at this house.

21:25.117 --> 21:26.786
-This is beautiful.
-Honey, you were saying

21:26.819 --> 21:29.088
you wanted a built-in grill,
and that is built-in.

21:29.121 --> 21:31.090
Oh, man, I get
to be grillmaster again.

21:31.123 --> 21:32.325
(laughs nervously)

21:32.359 --> 21:33.693
You make sure you enjoy

21:33.726 --> 21:35.362
every minute of quiet
you have left

21:35.395 --> 21:37.029
because once the baby comes,
it is going to blow up

21:37.063 --> 21:39.065
-your whole life.
-Okay. Okay.

21:40.232 --> 21:41.501
(tires screeching)

21:41.534 --> 21:43.169
Look around.
Get a feel for the place.

21:43.202 --> 21:45.271
Just leave the key in
the lockbox when you're done.

21:45.304 --> 21:46.639
Or-or keep it. (laughs)

21:46.673 --> 21:48.541
Whatever. Talk soon.

21:50.543 --> 21:52.945
AGATHA (sighs):
Pick up, Ruby. Pick up.

21:52.979 --> 21:55.314
-(line ringing)
-Oh, pick up, Ruby. Pick up!

21:55.348 --> 21:56.649
(sighs)
Okay.

21:56.683 --> 21:58.951
Agatha, you can figure this out.

21:58.985 --> 22:00.820
Everything is gonna be fine.

22:00.853 --> 22:03.155
-(thudding)
-(yelps) Son of an anglerfish!

22:03.189 --> 22:04.857
-(gasps)
-(tires screeching)

22:07.727 --> 22:10.797
(whimpers) It's probably
just a traffic cone.

22:10.830 --> 22:14.200
(gasps)
Oh, no.

22:14.233 --> 22:16.636
*

22:16.669 --> 22:18.104
Hello?

22:28.415 --> 22:30.316
(jabbering)
Heya, sis.

22:30.349 --> 22:34.253
Good old Uncle Brill's here
to see his favorite niece Ruby.

22:34.286 --> 22:36.022
-What? Brill?
-Heya.

22:36.055 --> 22:38.324
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. (grunts)

22:38.357 --> 22:39.892
Why wouldn't I be?

22:39.926 --> 22:41.494
I just hit you with a car.

22:41.528 --> 22:43.229
How do you guys deal with
the gravity here on land?

22:43.262 --> 22:44.864
It's crazy, right?
(laughing)

22:44.897 --> 22:47.534
Anyway, I came
to say congratulations.

22:47.567 --> 22:49.869
Ruby's all grown-up
and turned into a giant...

22:49.902 --> 22:52.338
Shh, shh, shh. Not so loud.

22:52.371 --> 22:53.873
-Come on.
-Whoa.

22:53.906 --> 22:55.074
I see you still got that
upper body strength, huh?

22:55.107 --> 22:57.877
-(grunting)
-Ow. Oof.

22:57.910 --> 22:59.879
(tires squealing)

22:59.912 --> 23:02.048
("Oh!" by The Linda Lindas
playing)

23:02.081 --> 23:03.550
-* Oh, when I say something
-(crunching)

23:03.583 --> 23:05.084
-Ow!
-* I wish I had shut up

23:05.117 --> 23:06.719
Are you kidding me?

23:06.753 --> 23:08.755
-* I always screw things up
-* Oh!

23:08.788 --> 23:09.889
* The places that feel right

23:09.922 --> 23:11.390
* They never last too long

23:11.424 --> 23:13.125
* And when I think of things

23:13.159 --> 23:14.761
-(heavy footsteps)
-* They always turn out wrong

23:14.794 --> 23:16.896
* Wrong, wrong, wrong,
wrong... *

23:16.929 --> 23:18.397
What are you doing here, Brill?

23:18.431 --> 23:19.398
We felt the pulse.

23:19.432 --> 23:21.400
So Mom knows?

23:21.434 --> 23:22.702
Uh, yeah.

23:22.735 --> 23:24.604
-She sent me to get Ruby.
-(groans)

23:24.637 --> 23:27.440
This is exactly why she wasn't
supposed to go into the ocean.

23:27.474 --> 23:29.108
Uh, then why would you
live next to it?

23:29.141 --> 23:30.810
-We needed to stay moist.
-Ew. Moist.

23:30.843 --> 23:32.545
-Where is she? Where is she?
-(heavy footsteps)

23:32.579 --> 23:33.913
-I need to hide her.
-Whoa.

23:33.946 --> 23:35.748
(laughs):
Good luck hiding that.

23:35.782 --> 23:37.283
* What can I say?

23:37.316 --> 23:39.586
* What can I do?
What can I do? *

23:39.619 --> 23:41.921
(tires screeching)

23:41.954 --> 23:43.556
(Brill grunting)

23:43.590 --> 23:45.157
BRILL:
Ow!

23:45.191 --> 23:48.094
* Oh! Oh!

23:49.962 --> 23:51.330
* Oh!

23:51.363 --> 23:53.766
-(tires screech)
-Oh, no.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.735
-Wow...
-Brill, stay.

23:55.768 --> 23:57.637
-(alarm beeps)
-(glass squeaking)

23:57.670 --> 23:58.938
Ruby Gillman, come out here.

23:58.971 --> 24:00.840
We need to get you home
right now.

24:00.873 --> 24:03.576
(whimpers)
But...

24:03.610 --> 24:06.846
I'm a... a monster.

24:07.947 --> 24:10.517
Oh, honey,
you're not a monster.

24:10.550 --> 24:12.218
Not even close.

24:14.353 --> 24:16.623
I don't want to yell.
Can we just talk?

24:18.124 --> 24:21.728
Please, just... (sighs)
just talk to me.

24:25.397 --> 24:27.066
(thuds)

24:35.141 --> 24:37.309
(Ruby sighs heavily)

24:38.344 --> 24:40.146
Hey, there's my girl.

24:40.179 --> 24:42.715
Please don't be mad.
I should have listened to you.

24:42.749 --> 24:44.517
But I kind of

24:44.551 --> 24:46.485
-went into the ocean.
-Went into the ocean?

24:46.519 --> 24:49.321
I know. But right now I just
want to keep you safe, honey,

24:49.355 --> 24:50.657
and that means
getting you home.

24:50.690 --> 24:52.892
Mom, look at me.

24:52.925 --> 24:57.329
(crying): I won't even fit
inside our house anymore.

24:57.363 --> 24:58.798
-Mom.
-Hey.

24:58.831 --> 25:00.733
Hey, hey. Shh.

25:00.767 --> 25:03.570
You'll get small again.
It just takes a little time.

25:03.603 --> 25:05.371
I'm here. I'll wait with you.

25:05.404 --> 25:06.639
I'm not going anywhere.

25:06.673 --> 25:08.040
(sniffles)

25:08.074 --> 25:10.242
I'm really glad
you're here, Mom.

25:13.045 --> 25:15.548
Do you remember when you found
that whale on the beach?

25:15.582 --> 25:16.849
(laughs, sniffles)

25:16.883 --> 25:19.351
You mean
Clarence J. Whifferton?

25:19.385 --> 25:20.720
How could I forget?

25:20.753 --> 25:22.589
Clarence J. Whifferton.

25:22.622 --> 25:25.491
You stood next to him
with a hose for seven hours

25:25.524 --> 25:26.826
until the tide came back in.

25:26.859 --> 25:28.828
Oh, yeah. (sniffles)

25:28.861 --> 25:30.329
I asked you
if I could keep him.

25:30.362 --> 25:31.931
Where would we even
have put him?

25:31.964 --> 25:33.432
We had a hose. A garage.

25:33.465 --> 25:36.202
Come on. I would have
taken care of him.

25:36.235 --> 25:37.704
I know you would have.

25:42.241 --> 25:44.310
*

25:45.645 --> 25:48.280
Yes. I'm normal.

25:48.314 --> 25:51.117
Well, almost normal. Thank you.

25:51.150 --> 25:53.753
Trust me, it's gonna be okay.

25:53.786 --> 25:55.521
Aw...

25:55.554 --> 25:56.789
(Ruby screams, grunts)

25:56.823 --> 25:58.625
(grunts)

25:58.658 --> 26:00.960
Ooh, I see you got
your mom's arm strength.

26:00.993 --> 26:03.630
Mom, what is happening?!

26:03.663 --> 26:04.897
(engine starts)

26:04.931 --> 26:06.966
(tires screeching)

26:08.067 --> 26:09.602
Hey, Tadpole. What's up?

26:09.636 --> 26:11.470
How would I know?
No one tells me anything.

26:11.503 --> 26:12.805
Ruby went into
the ocean, Arthur.

26:12.839 --> 26:14.607
-Oh, no!
-And you didn't die?

26:14.641 --> 26:16.308
-Die? Why would she die?
-Oh, no.

26:16.342 --> 26:17.777
-Who's this guy?
-Who's this kid?

26:17.810 --> 26:19.078
Uh, that's our son, Sam.

26:19.111 --> 26:21.480
Son? As in,
I'm an uncle? Again?

26:21.513 --> 26:23.215
I've never had an uncle before.

26:23.249 --> 26:25.584
And I've never had
a nephew before.

26:28.821 --> 26:31.624
Ruby, take a deep breath.

26:32.659 --> 26:34.326
Let me explain.

26:34.360 --> 26:36.996
You see, when you went
in the ocean, it triggered...

26:37.029 --> 26:38.665
Uh, it released...

26:38.698 --> 26:40.066
The kraken!

26:40.099 --> 26:41.133
(horn tooting)

26:44.036 --> 26:46.639
(sighs)
What Brill means

26:46.673 --> 26:49.976
is you turn into
a giant kraken.

26:51.110 --> 26:53.980
I know this is a lot
to process, Ruby,

26:54.013 --> 26:55.882
but you're not alone.

26:59.151 --> 27:01.220
I turn into
a giant kraken, too.

27:02.288 --> 27:04.824
What? What?

27:04.857 --> 27:06.392
You knew?

27:08.895 --> 27:10.296
So, I'm this?

27:10.329 --> 27:12.164
The horrible stereotype
of krakens

27:12.198 --> 27:14.033
that you said humans made up.

27:14.066 --> 27:16.202
-I'm offended.
-It sells. -(horn toots)

27:16.235 --> 27:17.704
So what else is true
about me, Mom?

27:17.737 --> 27:20.539
Do I sink ships now?
Do I terrorize sailors?

27:20.572 --> 27:22.208
No. No, honey. Not at all.

27:22.241 --> 27:24.811
All this time, you told me
we were hiding from monsters,

27:24.844 --> 27:27.046
and it turns out
I'm the monster.

27:27.079 --> 27:28.614
You lied to me.

27:28.647 --> 27:30.616
Think of it more as
a tiny omission.

27:30.649 --> 27:32.384
Come on. Turn giant.
I'm recording.

27:32.418 --> 27:33.786
Sam, put it away.

27:33.820 --> 27:35.454
But this is
the coolest thing ever.

27:35.487 --> 27:37.023
It is not cool.

27:37.056 --> 27:39.491
I was already a little weird,
but this?

27:39.525 --> 27:41.527
-I can't hide this.
-Yes, you can.

27:41.560 --> 27:42.962
You don't get it, Mom.

27:42.995 --> 27:46.532
Every single day,
I make sure no one notices

27:46.565 --> 27:48.334
all the ways
that I am different.

27:48.367 --> 27:50.302
I push my hair
in front of my gills,

27:50.336 --> 27:52.404
and I stand
like I have a spine.

27:52.438 --> 27:55.975
It's hard,
but this is impossible.

27:56.008 --> 27:57.977
No, because you can
control it, Ruby.

27:58.010 --> 28:00.346
Just like I have
for all these years.

28:00.379 --> 28:03.716
Yeah, but you didn't have to go
to high school with tentacles.

28:03.750 --> 28:05.317
Do I get tentacles, too?

28:05.351 --> 28:07.586
Sorry, son. Only the women
in our family turn giant.

28:07.619 --> 28:09.722
The men just become older,
rounder versions of ourselves.

28:09.756 --> 28:10.823
-It's not great.
-(phone dinging)

28:10.857 --> 28:12.524
AGATHA:
Ruby, listen.

28:12.558 --> 28:13.760
The ocean triggers
the transformation.

28:13.793 --> 28:15.061
But if you stay on dry land,

28:15.094 --> 28:16.662
you'll stay small
and on two legs.

28:16.695 --> 28:19.331
Cool. Everyone at school
is talking about the monster

28:19.365 --> 28:21.167
that destroyed the library.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.903
As long as no one figures out
it was you, we're safe.

28:23.936 --> 28:25.537
Your body is going
through changes.

28:25.571 --> 28:27.339
Think of it as blossoming.

28:27.373 --> 28:28.741
Ugh, Dad.

28:28.775 --> 28:30.409
Do your tentacles ooze poison?

28:30.442 --> 28:31.878
-AGATHA: Sam!
-How is this even
happening right now?

28:31.911 --> 28:33.545
As long as you stay
out of the ocean...

28:33.579 --> 28:34.881
-Your body is a flower.
-(Ruby groaning)

28:34.914 --> 28:37.116
-Do you grow any extra arms?
-Blossoming.

28:37.149 --> 28:38.717
-Women are so lucky.
-Things will go back to normal.

28:38.751 --> 28:41.387
-(horn tooting)
-Can everyone just stop?!

28:42.822 --> 28:45.624
Dad, this isn't a good thing.

28:45.657 --> 28:48.260
Sam, I'm going to strangle you
with my tentacles.

28:48.294 --> 28:49.695
And, Mom, I can't.

28:49.728 --> 28:50.963
I just can't right now.

28:53.732 --> 28:55.234
Ah, she forgot to do me.

28:55.267 --> 28:57.136
I don't even know you!

29:00.606 --> 29:01.707
(chittering)

29:01.740 --> 29:03.609
(muffled screaming)

29:05.577 --> 29:07.113
BRILL: Well, why can't we
just talk about it?

29:07.146 --> 29:08.915
AGATHA:
Because it doesn't matter.

29:08.948 --> 29:10.116
Keep it down, Brill.

29:10.149 --> 29:11.283
BRILL:
Sis, if I could find you,

29:11.317 --> 29:12.651
then it's only a matter of time

29:12.684 --> 29:13.953
before the rest
of the ocean can, too.

29:13.986 --> 29:15.888
I can handle this on my own.

29:15.922 --> 29:17.756
Just come home and talk to her.

29:17.790 --> 29:19.458
-She wants to help Ruby.
-(Agatha scoffs)

29:19.491 --> 29:21.127
She never just helps, though,
does she?

29:21.160 --> 29:23.495
(sighs) At least tell Ruby
the whole truth.

29:23.529 --> 29:25.331
AGATHA: Ruby's life
is on land now, Brill.

29:25.364 --> 29:27.800
I know you mean well,
but you need to stop.

29:27.834 --> 29:30.002
Go home and let me take care
of my daughter.

29:30.036 --> 29:32.171
Aggie...

29:32.204 --> 29:33.772
(sighs)

29:38.144 --> 29:42.114
I can't believe Mom is still
hiding things from me.

29:42.148 --> 29:43.983
(squeaks)

29:45.051 --> 29:47.786
(gasps)
Nessie, you tiny genius.

29:47.820 --> 29:50.622
That guy can't hide anything.

29:52.158 --> 29:54.193
(chittering)

29:57.897 --> 29:59.365
MAN:
Oh, put those on ice.

29:59.398 --> 30:00.799
MAN 2:
Good idea.

30:00.833 --> 30:02.068
WOMAN:
I can do both for you.

30:03.035 --> 30:04.170
(panting)

30:04.203 --> 30:05.504
Wha...

30:05.537 --> 30:06.805
GORDON (over speaker):
Lock your doors!

30:06.839 --> 30:08.875
The kraken has returned!

30:08.908 --> 30:10.509
Brill?

30:10.542 --> 30:12.011
(seagull squawking)

30:12.044 --> 30:14.246
Where is he? Where is he?
Where is he?

30:21.053 --> 30:22.521
(sighs)

30:22.554 --> 30:24.123
(Brill screaming)

30:24.156 --> 30:25.992
-Brill?
-BRILL: Get off me,
you feathery demons.

30:26.025 --> 30:28.060
-(seagulls squawking)
-Ow! You winged dopes.

30:28.094 --> 30:30.196
Ow, hey, hey.

30:30.229 --> 30:32.965
Save yourself.
It's too late for me.

30:32.999 --> 30:34.533
Forget the corn dog.

30:34.566 --> 30:36.502
(gasps) Did you see that?
They took my stick snack.

30:36.535 --> 30:37.970
Uncle Brill, focus.

30:38.004 --> 30:39.405
-I need to know.
-Mm-hmm?

30:39.438 --> 30:41.307
Who sent you here?

30:41.340 --> 30:43.309
Mmm. No. No, no, no. No.

30:43.342 --> 30:44.743
Please don't ask me things.

30:44.776 --> 30:46.478
I'm so bad at keeping secrets.

30:46.512 --> 30:48.147
Just talk to your mom.

30:48.180 --> 30:50.349
-Mom won't tell me anything.
-Well, neither will I.

30:50.382 --> 30:52.518
She should be the one to tell
you about your grandmother.

30:52.551 --> 30:53.585
(grunts)

30:53.619 --> 30:54.753
-My what?
-Nothing.

30:54.786 --> 30:56.222
I didn't say grandmother. What?

30:56.255 --> 30:58.857
Uh, I said landlubber. Ahoy?

30:58.891 --> 31:01.027
-I have a grandmother?
-No, no, no.

31:01.060 --> 31:02.261
Please, uh, don't listen to me.

31:02.294 --> 31:04.096
I don't know what I'm saying.

31:04.130 --> 31:05.831
-I'm hungry, and I'm
traumatized from before.
-Wait.

31:05.864 --> 31:07.199
-It's the birds...
-If only
the women in our family

31:07.233 --> 31:09.368
turn into giant krakens,

31:09.401 --> 31:12.004
then she's a giant kraken, too.

31:12.038 --> 31:14.373
Uh, let the record show
I kept that part a secret.

31:14.406 --> 31:15.908
-Is she here?
-What? No.

31:15.942 --> 31:18.010
Your grandmother would never
leave the ocean.

31:18.044 --> 31:20.346
Honestly, I don't know how your
mom did it all these years.

31:20.379 --> 31:23.382
Land is not built
for a giant kraken.

31:24.383 --> 31:25.918
-You're right.
-Mm-hmm.

31:25.952 --> 31:27.219
It's not.

31:28.887 --> 31:30.589
(sighs)

31:30.622 --> 31:33.259
I don't know the first thing
about being a giant kraken.

31:33.292 --> 31:35.294
But it's not fair
to keep me in the dark.

31:35.327 --> 31:36.562
Nope. Not at all.

31:36.595 --> 31:39.098
I can't keep waiting
for answers.

31:41.667 --> 31:43.735
-(waves crashing)
-*

31:47.806 --> 31:49.976
I need to take control
of my own life.

31:50.009 --> 31:51.077
You go, girl.

31:51.110 --> 31:53.145
-I'm a kraken.
-Preach.

31:53.179 --> 31:55.081
And if I want answers,
then there's only one person
who can help me.

31:55.114 --> 31:56.949
-Your mom.
-My grandmother.

31:56.983 --> 31:58.117
Yeah. No. What?

31:58.150 --> 31:59.451
I can't let you do that.

31:59.485 --> 32:01.220
-Your mom will kill me.
-(grunting)

32:01.253 --> 32:03.589
(groans, sighs)

32:03.622 --> 32:05.757
Uncle Brill... (sighs)

32:05.791 --> 32:08.694
...you have been more helpful
than you can imagine.

32:10.829 --> 32:12.598
(sighs heavily)

32:12.631 --> 32:17.003
You know, this is the first hug
we've had in 15 years.

32:18.470 --> 32:21.440
Then I'm really sorry.

32:21.473 --> 32:23.342
-For what?
-This.

32:24.443 --> 32:26.745
Oh! A stick snack.

32:26.778 --> 32:28.680
(seagull squawking)

32:30.216 --> 32:31.650
-(Brill yelling)
-(seagulls squawking)

32:31.683 --> 32:33.119
Help!

32:33.152 --> 32:35.021
(Brill screaming)

32:35.054 --> 32:37.156
*

32:39.558 --> 32:41.327
(exhales)

32:45.531 --> 32:47.633
*

33:06.085 --> 33:07.353
(gasps)

33:12.824 --> 33:14.826
*

33:15.861 --> 33:17.296
Real clever
with the stick trick.

33:17.329 --> 33:20.032
I admit that, but... Whoa.

33:20.066 --> 33:22.901
Yeah. It's kind of amazing.

33:22.934 --> 33:24.403
So, there's no way
I'm getting you

33:24.436 --> 33:26.472
out of the water now, is there?

33:26.505 --> 33:28.807
(sighs)
Well, follow me.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.876
Wait, Uncle Brill.

33:30.909 --> 33:32.544
Whoa, oh.

33:32.578 --> 33:35.847
* Look in the mirror

33:35.881 --> 33:38.884
-* And I start to tear up
-(laughing)

33:38.917 --> 33:41.987
* I don't even know
who's that I see *

33:42.020 --> 33:45.324
* I'm missing the way
things used to be *

33:45.357 --> 33:47.893
-* But I wipe 'em away now *
-(growls)

33:47.926 --> 33:49.995
* 'Cause I'm not afraid now *

33:50.028 --> 33:52.364
(villainous laughter)

33:52.398 --> 33:54.900
* I'm ready to find out
who I am *

33:54.933 --> 33:58.036
* Even if the world
don't understand *

33:58.070 --> 34:01.107
-(laughing)
-* 'Cause after
all this time finally... *

34:01.140 --> 34:03.075
Clarence?

34:03.109 --> 34:04.876
Clarence J. Whifferton.

34:04.910 --> 34:06.345
I'm so glad you made it.

34:06.378 --> 34:08.580
(whale sounds)

34:08.614 --> 34:09.715
You look great.

34:09.748 --> 34:11.717
*

34:11.750 --> 34:14.586
* Something 'bout tonight
got me feeling different *

34:14.620 --> 34:16.422
* I can see the bright lights
in the distance... *

34:16.455 --> 34:18.357
Uncle Brill, being in the ocean

34:18.390 --> 34:20.759
is more wonderful
than anything I could imagine.

34:20.792 --> 34:24.196
(laughs)
It only gets better from here.

34:24.230 --> 34:27.866
* Something in my mind
says to keep on going *

34:27.899 --> 34:30.736
* The fire inside
just keeps on glowing *

34:30.769 --> 34:33.539
* Tell my old self,
"Hey, you'll be missed" *

34:33.572 --> 34:36.808
* But I've been waiting
my whole life for this *

34:36.842 --> 34:38.710
-(laughing)
-* Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

34:38.744 --> 34:40.446
* Oh, this moment

34:40.479 --> 34:43.115
* Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh

34:43.149 --> 34:45.417
* Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

34:45.451 --> 34:46.752
Whoa, oh.

34:46.785 --> 34:49.488
* Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh.

34:50.589 --> 34:52.224
-(laughing)
-(song ends)

34:52.258 --> 34:53.592
Wow.

34:53.625 --> 34:55.427
That was wild.

34:55.461 --> 34:58.997
Welcome to
the Kingdom of the Krakens.

34:59.030 --> 35:01.133
*

35:23.121 --> 35:25.557
*

35:30.296 --> 35:32.364
*

35:33.699 --> 35:35.100
Whoa.

35:35.133 --> 35:36.802
BRILL: Yeah,
I know what you're thinking.

35:36.835 --> 35:38.036
It's a little over the top.

35:38.069 --> 35:40.172
But you know royals.

35:40.206 --> 35:41.307
Royals?

35:41.340 --> 35:42.341
You mean my grandmother's a...

35:42.374 --> 35:44.142
GRANDMAMAH:
A queen!

35:44.176 --> 35:46.011
A warrior queen,

35:46.044 --> 35:47.946
Ultimate Lordess,

35:47.979 --> 35:50.216
Ruler of the Seven Seas,

35:50.249 --> 35:51.883
-et cetera, et cetera.
-(gasps)

35:51.917 --> 35:53.185
Give me a hug.

35:53.219 --> 35:55.354
So tight.

35:55.387 --> 35:57.189
-BRILL: Oh.
-Not now, Brill.

35:57.223 --> 35:58.557
It's Ruby's time now.

35:58.590 --> 36:00.492
You said you'd be okay
with it, huh?

36:00.526 --> 36:01.527
Of course, Mamah.

36:01.560 --> 36:02.994
I'm not that needy, so...

36:03.028 --> 36:05.063
I can't believe
you're my grandmother.

36:05.096 --> 36:09.401
Please, call me Grandmamah.

36:09.435 --> 36:11.169
You seem surprised by the level

36:11.203 --> 36:14.506
of general majesty
and royal splendor.

36:14.540 --> 36:17.643
I definitely wasn't expecting
the whole queen thing.

36:17.676 --> 36:20.912
Your mother never told you
you were royalty?

36:20.946 --> 36:23.148
I guess it was another
tiny omission.

36:23.181 --> 36:25.083
Tiny omission?!

36:25.116 --> 36:26.818
-Agatha!
-(gasps)

36:26.852 --> 36:28.920
(whooshing)

36:31.189 --> 36:33.559
Don't worry.
I go to therapy now.

36:33.592 --> 36:36.328
I see a wise hammerhead shark
on Wednesdays and Fridays,

36:36.362 --> 36:37.763
and I've let my rage go.

36:37.796 --> 36:39.498
Away, rage.

36:39.531 --> 36:41.600
Ah, cookies.

36:41.633 --> 36:44.436
Help yourself, Ruby.

36:44.470 --> 36:47.105
Mmm. They're really...
they're really good.

36:47.138 --> 36:48.407
A little mushy.

36:48.440 --> 36:50.409
I made someone
make them myself.

36:50.442 --> 36:53.379
Now, talk to your grandmamah.

36:53.412 --> 36:55.046
Tell me everything.

36:55.080 --> 36:58.049
Was it horrible living among
the hairy crust dwellers?

36:58.083 --> 36:59.785
-You mean people?
-(laughing)

36:59.818 --> 37:02.388
Even the word makes
my tentacles squirm.

37:02.421 --> 37:03.889
People are kinda nice,
actually.

37:03.922 --> 37:05.257
I have a couple of friends.

37:05.291 --> 37:06.758
I asked a boy to prom,

37:06.792 --> 37:08.860
but, you know,
it... it did not go great.

37:08.894 --> 37:11.563
Well, deary, you can put
all that behind you.

37:11.597 --> 37:13.632
You're made for bigger things.

37:13.665 --> 37:15.467
Come with me.

37:15.501 --> 37:17.569
-*
-(excited chattering)

37:19.738 --> 37:21.473
MALE:
I see her. It's Ruby.

37:21.507 --> 37:23.241
FEMALE:
Whoa. It's Ruby.

37:23.275 --> 37:25.243
-FEMALE: It's her.
-CHILD: Look, it's the princess.

37:25.277 --> 37:26.578
FEMALE:
Is this actually her?

37:26.612 --> 37:28.113
Aw. Thank you.

37:28.146 --> 37:29.415
MALE:
Is that Ruby?

37:29.448 --> 37:30.882
FEMALE:
Look, look. It's her.

37:30.916 --> 37:32.284
CHILD:
She's so pretty.

37:32.318 --> 37:33.585
(excited chattering)

37:33.619 --> 37:35.587
Hi, Ruby.

37:35.621 --> 37:37.756
(excited chattering continues)

37:37.789 --> 37:40.492
Fellow krakens,

37:40.526 --> 37:44.162
here at last
is my granddaughter.

37:44.195 --> 37:46.498
After 15 years,

37:46.532 --> 37:49.301
Princess Ruby has finally
returned home

37:49.335 --> 37:52.638
to be my successor.

37:52.671 --> 37:55.474
(cheering)

37:55.507 --> 37:58.410
(laughs nervously): Wait. Wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

37:58.444 --> 37:59.945
I'm gonna be a, a what now?

37:59.978 --> 38:01.913
Ruby, you're a princess.

38:01.947 --> 38:03.515
-Address the crowd.
-(whimpering)

38:03.549 --> 38:05.317
(hyperventilating)

38:05.351 --> 38:07.185
(krakens gasping)

38:07.218 --> 38:10.088
(whimpering):
I think...

38:10.121 --> 38:13.291
I am having a panic attack!

38:13.325 --> 38:15.694
-(cheering)
-MALE: Panic attack!

38:15.727 --> 38:17.796
(cheering fades)

38:22.000 --> 38:24.002
(door creaks)

38:24.035 --> 38:26.372
(breathing quietly)

38:26.405 --> 38:28.474
(sighs heavily)

38:29.508 --> 38:31.877
(panting)

38:32.911 --> 38:34.580
(squeaks)

38:36.848 --> 38:37.983
So, Grandma...

38:38.016 --> 38:39.685
Uh, "Grandmamah."

38:39.718 --> 38:41.553
It goes up on the second "mah."

38:41.587 --> 38:43.989
Oh, sorry. Um, Grandmamah,

38:44.022 --> 38:45.624
um, you have the wrong person.

38:45.657 --> 38:48.694
I'm just Ruby Gillman,
normal teenager.

38:48.727 --> 38:50.328
Normal according to who?

38:50.362 --> 38:51.863
The women in our family

38:51.897 --> 38:54.132
have been gifted
the mighty power

38:54.165 --> 38:56.635
to turn into giant kraken.

38:56.668 --> 39:00.806
You are only one of three giant
krakens on this Earth, Ruby.

39:00.839 --> 39:04.209
We must protect the ocean
and its creatures.

39:04.242 --> 39:07.178
But many monsters have coveted
our position

39:07.212 --> 39:10.482
and have tried to seize
the throne for themselves.

39:10.516 --> 39:13.585
Brag alert,
they never succeeded.

39:13.619 --> 39:15.220
The Leviathan,

39:15.253 --> 39:16.855
Umibozu,

39:16.888 --> 39:19.891
and the most power-hungry
and dangerous of them all...

39:19.925 --> 39:21.259
The mermaid?

39:22.293 --> 39:24.329
Yes, the mermaid!

39:24.362 --> 39:26.097
But people love mermaids.

39:26.131 --> 39:28.266
Of course they do.

39:28.299 --> 39:30.068
People are stupid.

39:30.101 --> 39:34.005
Mermaids are selfish,
vain narcissists

39:34.039 --> 39:35.541
with mediocre hair,

39:35.574 --> 39:39.511
and their queen, Nerissa,
the worst of them all.

39:39.545 --> 39:41.279
She wanted to control the ocean

39:41.312 --> 39:45.617
and force its creatures
to serve her and her alone.

39:45.651 --> 39:49.120
Normally, mermaids would be
no match for us giant kraken--

39:49.154 --> 39:50.789
much too puny--

39:50.822 --> 39:53.925
but their queen found
an ancient weapon,

39:53.959 --> 39:56.428
the Trident of Oceanus.

39:56.462 --> 40:00.532
The only weapon powerful enough
to defeat a giant kraken.

40:00.566 --> 40:02.701
We formed the front lines
against her,

40:02.734 --> 40:04.870
-and for that...
-(warriors shouting, grunting)

40:04.903 --> 40:08.640
...we paid a terrible price.

40:08.674 --> 40:11.109
Frankly, I suppose
we'd all be kelp toast

40:11.142 --> 40:13.945
if it wasn't for your mother.

40:13.979 --> 40:15.213
No way.

40:15.246 --> 40:16.448
That's my mom?

40:16.482 --> 40:17.816
Was she actually cool?

40:17.849 --> 40:19.618
She was our greatest warrior.

40:19.651 --> 40:21.620
I mean, of course she was.
I taught her everything I know.

40:21.653 --> 40:24.923
She engaged in a great battle
with the tyrant mermaid

40:24.956 --> 40:27.325
and wrested away the Trident.

40:27.358 --> 40:30.261
I called it
her "queen-making moment."

40:30.295 --> 40:32.297
It was glorious.

40:32.330 --> 40:35.501
Nerissa fled in disgrace.
(chuckles)

40:35.534 --> 40:38.970
We had a chance
to crush the mermaids forever,

40:39.004 --> 40:40.906
but your mother did
the unfathomable.

40:40.939 --> 40:42.774
She hid the Trident away,

40:42.808 --> 40:45.076
left her kingdom,
left her kind,

40:45.110 --> 40:47.746
all to play human?

40:47.779 --> 40:50.148
(whooshing)

40:50.181 --> 40:51.817
Whoa.

40:51.850 --> 40:53.451
You have laser eyes?

40:53.485 --> 40:56.254
Well, it's electrically charged
bioluminescence,

40:56.287 --> 40:58.690
but, yeah,
they do pack a wallop.

40:58.724 --> 41:00.458
You have the powers,
too, you know.

41:00.492 --> 41:03.595
Besides growing big
at super awkward moments?

41:03.629 --> 41:05.764
You're special, Ruby.

41:05.797 --> 41:08.800
You feel it
in the core of your being.

41:08.834 --> 41:10.836
Let me teach you.

41:10.869 --> 41:13.639
But my mom told me that
if I stay out of the ocean,

41:13.672 --> 41:14.973
I won't turn into a...

41:15.006 --> 41:16.374
A giant kraken?

41:16.407 --> 41:19.310
You are not a human
who turns into a kraken.

41:19.344 --> 41:23.515
You're a kraken
hiding as a human.

41:23.549 --> 41:25.383
Once you know
what you're capable of,

41:25.416 --> 41:27.786
you'll want to be
the next kraken queen.

41:27.819 --> 41:29.721
It's your birthright.

41:29.755 --> 41:33.124
And fight as you might,
fight as you will,

41:33.158 --> 41:36.461
you can never outswim
your destiny.

41:36.494 --> 41:38.196
I don't know, Grandmamah.

41:38.229 --> 41:40.699
I like math and Connor.

41:40.732 --> 41:44.002
You know, teen stuff.

41:45.003 --> 41:47.172
Very well.

41:47.205 --> 41:50.709
I loved spending this time
with you, Ruby.

41:50.742 --> 41:52.744
Me, too.

41:52.778 --> 41:54.880
Thank you for telling me
the truth.

41:54.913 --> 41:57.348
Until we meet again.

42:00.118 --> 42:02.387
Wait. You're just gonna
let her go?

42:02.420 --> 42:03.855
She'll be back.

42:03.889 --> 42:06.224
A kraken always
answers the call.

42:06.257 --> 42:09.094
That's what you said
about Agatha.

42:13.799 --> 42:15.867
*

42:20.939 --> 42:22.173
Bye, Clarence.

42:22.207 --> 42:24.242
(whale sounds)

42:29.948 --> 42:31.449
(gasps)

42:33.418 --> 42:35.353
(gasps)
Kraken ahoy!

42:35.386 --> 42:38.289
(strained grunting)

42:38.323 --> 42:42.093
Davey, hard to port.
Full power!

42:42.127 --> 42:44.963
*

42:47.565 --> 42:49.467
(cackling)

42:49.500 --> 42:52.437
(grunting)

42:52.470 --> 42:54.806
Fly. Fly, me beauties.

42:56.842 --> 42:58.476
(gasps)
Wha...

42:59.611 --> 43:00.712
(gasping)

43:00.746 --> 43:02.580
Let's get a closer look at ya.

43:02.614 --> 43:04.482
(grunts)

43:06.618 --> 43:07.986
-Laser eyes, go!
-(crackling)

43:08.019 --> 43:09.955
Laser eyes, go!

43:09.988 --> 43:10.989
Laser eyes?

43:11.022 --> 43:13.258
Hold her steady, Davey.

43:15.160 --> 43:16.662
(kisses, chuckles)

43:20.766 --> 43:22.067
(gasps)

43:22.100 --> 43:23.301
(laughs)

43:23.334 --> 43:26.071
Bit of a spicy tuna, aren't ya?

43:26.104 --> 43:28.840
-Wait. Is that...?
-CHELSEA: The new girl.

43:28.874 --> 43:30.676
Oh, my gosh. Hey.

43:30.709 --> 43:33.111
Chelsea?
H-How are you even down here?

43:33.144 --> 43:38.483
Because
I'm a motherflippin' mermaid.

43:38.516 --> 43:40.085
I figured I owed you
an underwater rescue

43:40.118 --> 43:43.855
since I kinda, sorta, 100%
got credit for yours.

43:43.889 --> 43:46.124
Time for the Gordon special.

43:46.157 --> 43:48.860
Surprise. It's a bomb!

43:49.995 --> 43:52.831
We should get going
or, like, die. Your call.

43:55.967 --> 43:58.970
-(explosion)
-(Gordon yelling)

43:59.004 --> 44:01.072
(screaming)

44:06.544 --> 44:08.279
-Don't say it, Davey.
-(claws clattering)

44:08.313 --> 44:10.215
You're such a naysayer.

44:13.351 --> 44:15.020
(breathlessly):
Okay.

44:15.053 --> 44:16.654
I still can't believe
you're a...

44:16.688 --> 44:18.556
A ten with a fin?
A fish come true?

44:18.589 --> 44:21.126
A mermaid?

44:21.159 --> 44:23.161
Ooh, I can't believe I can
finally have a friend

44:23.194 --> 44:24.963
to share things with.

44:24.996 --> 44:27.565
A super sea-girl bestie.

44:27.598 --> 44:30.368
Look, Chelsea, thanks for what
you did back there,

44:30.401 --> 44:34.239
but I started this day thinking
that my biggest issue was prom.

44:34.272 --> 44:37.508
And now, I got
a whole lot more going on.

44:37.542 --> 44:39.510
So I just need to go home,

44:39.544 --> 44:42.647
get some sleep and pretend
this day never happened.

44:42.680 --> 44:45.884
Look, I just thought
we had a lot in common,

44:45.917 --> 44:50.255
but if you're gonna be salty
about it, then bye-bye.

44:55.460 --> 44:58.529
-(hinges creaking)
-(crickets chirping)

45:00.098 --> 45:02.133
(sighs)

45:05.236 --> 45:07.305
(Nessie purring)

45:08.874 --> 45:11.743
-(alarm ringing)
-(gasping)

45:11.777 --> 45:13.411
(sighs heavily)

45:13.444 --> 45:14.880
-Okay, Ruby, you got this.
-(ringing stops)

45:14.913 --> 45:16.748
You just need
to make it to school

45:16.782 --> 45:19.250
and have a completely,
totally ordinary day.

45:19.284 --> 45:21.452
-Huh?
-(panting)

45:22.487 --> 45:24.422
(exhales, sniffs)

45:27.458 --> 45:28.794
ARTHUR:
Honey,

45:28.827 --> 45:31.029
you've gotta stop
beating yourself up.

45:31.062 --> 45:32.798
Oh, Arthur.

45:32.831 --> 45:34.699
I can't believe I didn't
tell her any of this sooner.

45:34.732 --> 45:36.201
I mean, what was I thinking?

45:36.234 --> 45:38.369
You were thinking about
protecting her,

45:38.403 --> 45:39.905
like you always have.

45:39.938 --> 45:41.807
What if she drops out
of school?

45:41.840 --> 45:43.809
I mean, what if she doesn't get
a job and runs away like I did?

45:43.842 --> 45:47.745
(gasps) What if she hates me
like I hate my mom?

45:47.779 --> 45:49.614
It's a slippery slope, Arthur.

45:49.647 --> 45:51.282
Hate's a strong word.

45:51.316 --> 45:52.550
And she loves you.

45:52.583 --> 45:54.252
She'll never run away.

45:54.285 --> 45:56.354
(door creaks open)

46:00.191 --> 46:01.927
Huh. This doesn't help my case.

46:01.960 --> 46:03.829
Ruby, hey. How are you feeling?

46:03.862 --> 46:06.764
Did you sleep okay?
Everything back to normal?

46:06.798 --> 46:08.766
Yeah. Mm-hmm. Totally fine.

46:08.800 --> 46:10.936
Are you sure?
Oh, you look a little flushed.

46:10.969 --> 46:13.204
Mom, I'm fine. Really.

46:15.140 --> 46:16.441
(sniffing)

46:17.775 --> 46:20.745
Ruby, is that salt water
on your breath?

46:20.778 --> 46:22.313
Salt water? What?

46:22.347 --> 46:23.748
No. I really gotta go.

46:23.781 --> 46:25.783
Good. Okay.
Well, if you do want to talk,

46:25.817 --> 46:27.152
I'll be right here.

46:27.185 --> 46:28.820
I just... I just really
want you to know

46:28.854 --> 46:30.655
that you never have
to hide things from me.

46:30.688 --> 46:32.757
-Hmm, like you?
-What did you say, honey?

46:32.790 --> 46:34.425
Nothing. Bye, Mom.

46:34.459 --> 46:36.361
Love you. Make good choices.

46:36.394 --> 46:38.063
(sighs)

46:40.031 --> 46:41.632
(sighs heavily)

46:42.533 --> 46:44.769
* High

46:44.802 --> 46:47.138
* There's a reason
for my high *

46:47.172 --> 46:49.140
* There's a whole world
outside... *

46:49.174 --> 46:52.177
It destroyed the YA Zombie
Romance section.

46:52.210 --> 46:55.013
The YA Zombie Romance section!

46:55.046 --> 46:56.347
-MAN: Eric.
-ERIC: Yeah.

46:56.381 --> 46:57.515
-Take a look at this.
-Nonfiction?

46:57.548 --> 46:58.616
Mom, I changed my mind.

46:58.649 --> 46:59.817
I want to be homeschooled again.

46:59.851 --> 47:00.952
I never liked that
library anyway.

47:00.986 --> 47:02.387
BOY:
We have a library?

47:02.420 --> 47:04.622
Godzilla could not beat
that thing in a fight.

47:04.655 --> 47:06.657
A tentacled freak
from the deep shows up,
and I'm supposed to learn math?

47:06.691 --> 47:07.725
BOY 2:
So gross.

47:07.758 --> 47:09.294
-There you are!
-(screams)

47:09.327 --> 47:10.862
Why'd you stop answering
our texts last night?

47:10.896 --> 47:12.697
I was worried
that monster got to you.

47:12.730 --> 47:15.400
I carved us each a whistle
out of juniper wood.

47:15.433 --> 47:16.968
Blowing it could give you
precious seconds

47:17.002 --> 47:18.703
to abscond with your lives.

47:18.736 --> 47:20.005
Sick. Juniper wood
has been known

47:20.038 --> 47:21.806
to have kraken-defeating powers.

47:21.839 --> 47:23.208
What? Kraken?

47:23.241 --> 47:24.842
Why would you say that?

47:24.876 --> 47:26.878
Ev-Everyone knows that krakens
aren't real, so...

47:26.912 --> 47:28.413
Behold, a plot twist.

47:28.446 --> 47:31.682
15 years ago,
you all laughed at me.

47:31.716 --> 47:33.384
Sorry. Not you, Davey.

47:33.418 --> 47:35.253
You're right,
you always believed me.

47:35.286 --> 47:39.657
But now I finally have proof
that krakens exist.

47:39.690 --> 47:42.160
A lot of you have been asking
about my beard regimen.

47:42.193 --> 47:43.528
(gasps)
Kraken!

47:43.561 --> 47:45.663
Kraken ahoy! She's back!

47:45.696 --> 47:47.332
(panting)

47:47.365 --> 47:49.034
Oh, she's coming for me.

47:49.067 --> 47:52.003
(yells) Davey,
get the picturephone.

47:52.037 --> 47:53.338
-(screams)
-(splashing)

47:53.371 --> 47:54.940
WOMAN:
Do you see it?

47:54.973 --> 47:57.208
With your help,
we will drag this abomination

47:57.242 --> 48:02.280
into the light and finally
reveal what it truly is.

48:02.313 --> 48:04.249
(Gordon cackling)

48:04.282 --> 48:06.884
(chuckles) Can't help
but root for that guy.

48:06.918 --> 48:11.422
A great darkness has risen
from the depths to claim us all.

48:11.456 --> 48:13.858
And this time,
she is not catastrophizing.

48:13.891 --> 48:15.560
I mean, this is wacky Gordon.

48:15.593 --> 48:16.928
You can't take him seriously.

48:16.962 --> 48:19.097
He only has, like,
ten subscribers.

48:19.130 --> 48:20.598
-For now.
-Huh?

48:20.631 --> 48:22.767
Trevin is sharing it across
all of his socials.

48:22.800 --> 48:24.302
-He's what?
-What? You've never
heard of my channel?

48:24.335 --> 48:25.770
A lot of people watch
my gaming live streams.

48:25.803 --> 48:27.072
How many is a lot?

48:27.105 --> 48:28.906
About a hundred and forty...
thousand.

48:28.940 --> 48:31.943
-(gasps)
-And... video posted.

48:31.977 --> 48:33.544
-There, it's out there
forever now.
-Wait.

48:33.578 --> 48:35.380
GORDON (through phones):
Kraken! Kraken! Kraken ahoy!

48:35.413 --> 48:36.814
CONNOR:
Dude, can you believe it?

48:36.847 --> 48:38.283
-Kraken! Kraken!
-That old boat dude was right.

48:38.316 --> 48:40.718
-Kraken ahoy!
-That thing is legit a monster.

48:40.751 --> 48:42.453
A real-life monster.

48:42.487 --> 48:44.722
-MARGOT: Ruby? Cue Ruby.
-(hyperventilating)

48:44.755 --> 48:45.756
(groans)

48:45.790 --> 48:47.325
Bliss, get the smelling salts.

48:47.358 --> 48:48.893
(whimpering)

48:48.926 --> 48:50.428
Where are you going?

48:50.461 --> 48:52.097
You forgot your whistle!

48:52.130 --> 48:53.731
GORDON (through phones):
Kraken! Kraken!

48:53.764 --> 48:55.266
-(panting)
-Kraken ahoy!

48:55.300 --> 48:57.402
Kraken! Kraken!

48:57.435 --> 48:59.270
-Kraken ahoy!
-No running in the halls.

49:01.806 --> 49:04.409
(breathing rapidly)

49:04.442 --> 49:06.811
(gasping for air,
breathing slows)

49:08.213 --> 49:09.780
(door creaks open)

49:09.814 --> 49:11.782
BOY:
With a kraken running loose,

49:11.816 --> 49:13.351
you could use a bodyguard.

49:13.384 --> 49:14.352
CHELSEA:
Aw, you're sweet.

49:14.385 --> 49:15.586
The monster could be lurking

49:15.620 --> 49:16.621
around any corner.

49:16.654 --> 49:17.788
I'd fight it for you.

49:17.822 --> 49:19.157
-Chelsea?
-(high-pitched scream)

49:19.190 --> 49:20.225
Can I talk to you?

49:21.126 --> 49:22.693
Okay, everyone out.

49:22.727 --> 49:24.829
-Private talk time. Bye.
-(students grumbling)

49:25.830 --> 49:27.765
So, what's up?

49:27.798 --> 49:29.767
Chelsea, about last night,
I am sorry that I ran...

49:29.800 --> 49:32.303
Oh. Apologies are so corny.

49:32.337 --> 49:34.972
Just skip to the part
where you tell me everything.

49:35.006 --> 49:37.108
Look, I... (sighs)

49:37.142 --> 49:40.178
You are here on land one day,
and you already fit in.

49:40.211 --> 49:43.781
I've been here all of my life,
and I still feel like a freak.

49:43.814 --> 49:47.785
I-I just want to be
Ruby Gillman, normal teenager.

49:47.818 --> 49:50.855
Oh, boo.
Where's the fun in that?

49:50.888 --> 49:52.823
Ruby, you're a giant kraken.

49:52.857 --> 49:55.293
Don't you think you could aim
a little bit higher

49:55.326 --> 49:58.029
than "normal teenager"?

49:58.063 --> 50:02.067
Oh, my cute little, floppy,
baby guppy girl.

50:02.100 --> 50:03.734
You know what you need?

50:03.768 --> 50:05.570
Great hair and a mermaid tail?

50:05.603 --> 50:07.972
(laughs)
No, but it would help.

50:08.005 --> 50:09.874
What you need, Ruby Gillman,

50:09.907 --> 50:12.910
is to see how great
your life could be.

50:12.943 --> 50:16.447
You need a super sea-girl
ditch day!

50:17.448 --> 50:19.684
Okay. Let's do it.

50:19.717 --> 50:22.187
-Yay!
-(laughing)

50:22.220 --> 50:24.489
MAN (over P.A.):
Just four more days until prom,

50:24.522 --> 50:26.524
the last evening of joy

50:26.557 --> 50:29.094
before entering the drudgery
of adulthood.

50:29.127 --> 50:31.196
("plastic pony" by mxmtoon
playing)

50:33.864 --> 50:36.201
(Chelsea laughing)

50:36.234 --> 50:37.868
-* I bought a ticket to life
-Woo-hoo!

50:37.902 --> 50:39.404
-* Rose-colored eyes
-Whoa!

50:39.437 --> 50:43.040
* Made a home
in halls of mirrors *

50:43.074 --> 50:45.710
* It was all fun and games

50:45.743 --> 50:50.715
* Love what I played,
but now I see a little clearer *

50:50.748 --> 50:54.419
* The more that I see myself

50:54.452 --> 50:58.456
* The less that I know
about me *

50:58.489 --> 51:02.593
* Was riding the carousel
up and down... *

51:02.627 --> 51:03.928
This day's been amazing.

51:03.961 --> 51:05.863
I mean,
seven seas in seven hours?

51:05.896 --> 51:07.698
And don't get me started
about how wrong they got

51:07.732 --> 51:10.067
the crystal jellyfish in the
Marine Biologist Quarterly.

51:10.101 --> 51:12.470
Sorry.
Am I geeking out too much?

51:12.503 --> 51:14.539
No.

51:14.572 --> 51:17.041
(both laughing)

51:17.074 --> 51:19.043
(sighs)

51:19.076 --> 51:23.448
I still can't believe your mom
hid all of this from you.

51:23.481 --> 51:26.151
"Hiding is surviving."

51:26.184 --> 51:27.718
That's the Gillman
family motto.

51:27.752 --> 51:29.754
Mottoes are stupid.
That's my motto.

51:29.787 --> 51:31.088
I hate hiding.

51:31.122 --> 51:32.723
But you're crushing it
at school.

51:32.757 --> 51:34.225
Everyone loves you.

51:34.259 --> 51:36.093
You really do have everything.

51:36.127 --> 51:37.728
(scoffs)
No, I don't.

51:37.762 --> 51:39.964
Ever since
the Battle of the Trident,

51:39.997 --> 51:42.467
all us mermaids
have been in hiding.

51:42.500 --> 51:44.469
I couldn't take it anymore.

51:44.502 --> 51:47.938
I felt trapped, so I ran away.

51:47.972 --> 51:51.842
But when I ended up
at Oceanside High, I was alone.

51:51.876 --> 51:54.779
No one could see the real me.

51:54.812 --> 51:59.650
And then I found you,
my super sea-girl bestie,

51:59.684 --> 52:02.287
and now everything is right
in the world.

52:02.320 --> 52:04.622
If it wasn't for this whole
mermaid versus kraken war,

52:04.655 --> 52:07.825
you and I could be this free
all the time.

52:07.858 --> 52:09.427
Oh, sure. Yeah.

52:09.460 --> 52:13.030
But, I mean, two teenage girls
can't fix history.

52:13.063 --> 52:16.267
Wait. What's the first rule
of being a mathlete?

52:16.301 --> 52:18.969
Hmm. Never talk about
being a mathlete?

52:19.003 --> 52:21.706
No. We have to evaluate
the problem.

52:21.739 --> 52:23.541
Chelsea, come on.

52:23.574 --> 52:25.676
There must be some way
to end this war

52:25.710 --> 52:27.445
so you won't have to hide
from the krakens

52:27.478 --> 52:29.647
and I won't have to become
a prophesied princess warrior

52:29.680 --> 52:30.981
of an interspecies vendetta.

52:31.015 --> 52:34.785
Well, there is one way.

52:34.819 --> 52:36.621
Picture this:

52:36.654 --> 52:39.690
Chelsea Van Der Zee
and Ruby Gillman save the seas

52:39.724 --> 52:42.560
by finding
the Trident of Oceanus.

52:42.593 --> 52:44.562
That giant fork
my grandma's so obsessed with?

52:44.595 --> 52:47.365
Yes. The Trident.
Stay with me.

52:47.398 --> 52:49.166
Once we have the Trident,

52:49.200 --> 52:51.369
we can show that there doesn't
have to be a war anymore.

52:51.402 --> 52:55.573
It can be a symbol of peace.

52:55.606 --> 52:57.742
Then my grandmother wouldn't
have to train me for battle.

52:57.775 --> 53:01.246
I can live in the ocean
and on land as the real me.

53:01.279 --> 53:02.980
No more fighting.

53:03.013 --> 53:05.550
And the mermaids wouldn't have
to live in fear anymore.

53:05.583 --> 53:06.851
No more hiding.

53:06.884 --> 53:08.553
-No fighting.
-No hiding.

53:08.586 --> 53:13.258
BOTH: No fighting! No hiding!
No fighting! No hiding!

53:13.291 --> 53:15.192
WOMAN:
I'm nervous about the barbecue.

53:15.226 --> 53:16.894
AGATHA:
Oh, Carol, come on.

53:16.927 --> 53:19.364
No one knows what happened
exactly to the library.

53:19.397 --> 53:21.266
Sam, no headphones
at the table.

53:21.299 --> 53:23.234
-CAROL: It's completely gone.
-It could have been a gas leak.

53:23.268 --> 53:26.437
Trust me, your buyers are gonna
love Oceanside's tranquility.

53:26.471 --> 53:28.105
REPORTER: Tranquility
has turned to terror

53:28.138 --> 53:30.375
here in Oceanside
as more and more witnesses

53:30.408 --> 53:32.743
report having seen
the giant kraken.

53:32.777 --> 53:35.079
(laughing):
Knock, knock. Who's there?

53:35.112 --> 53:37.282
It's Uncle Brill.
I'm already inside.

53:37.315 --> 53:38.683
Ooh, don't mind if I do.

53:38.716 --> 53:40.918
Just one second, Carol.
(feigns laughter)

53:40.951 --> 53:42.453
-(grunts)
-What are you doing here?

53:42.487 --> 53:44.689
When I came back empty-handed,
Mom hit the roof.

53:44.722 --> 53:46.424
I need a place to crash
till she cools down.

53:46.457 --> 53:48.058
A few months, a couple years.

53:48.092 --> 53:49.927
Century, tops.

53:49.960 --> 53:51.429
Um, hon, uh, this isn't good.

53:51.462 --> 53:53.798
I'm here
with Captain Gordon Lighthouse.

53:53.831 --> 53:55.966
Now, Mr. Lighthouse, you
allegedly claim to have seen...

53:56.000 --> 53:57.302
The face of death!

53:57.335 --> 53:59.069
Allegedly.

53:59.103 --> 54:00.538
-Ow, ow, ow. Ow.
-You out there,

54:00.571 --> 54:03.574
I need any able-bodied man,
woman or child

54:03.608 --> 54:05.376
-to help crew my vessel...
-REPORTER: Get off. Ow! Ooh.

54:05.410 --> 54:07.144
...and capture the kraken!

54:07.177 --> 54:09.046
(screams)
That guy's terrifying,

54:09.079 --> 54:10.781
and I live with a warlord.

54:10.815 --> 54:12.650
Aggie, he's got her on video.

54:12.683 --> 54:14.151
CAROL: Agatha, are you still
there? What's going on?

54:14.184 --> 54:15.553
No, it's nothing.

54:15.586 --> 54:17.221
Bring your buyers Saturday.

54:17.254 --> 54:18.823
ARTHUR:
Uh-oh.

54:18.856 --> 54:20.625
-She's got that look.
-The one where she wants us

54:20.658 --> 54:23.328
to do something
we don't want to do.

54:23.361 --> 54:26.397
I've been searching for kraken
me entire life.

54:26.431 --> 54:28.799
And it cost me dearly.

54:28.833 --> 54:30.167
-(claws clattering)
-Oh, fine, yes.

54:30.200 --> 54:32.269
But if it wasn't
for the kraken,

54:32.303 --> 54:34.472
I wouldn't have bought the boat,
and without the boat,

54:34.505 --> 54:36.341
I wouldn't have
mortgaged my house, and if
I didn't mortgage my house,

54:36.374 --> 54:38.476
Tammy wouldn't have left me.

54:38.509 --> 54:40.077
Huh. Been there.

54:40.110 --> 54:41.679
(whispering): Are we still
talking about krakens?

54:41.712 --> 54:43.681
Gordon, if it's from the ocean,
I'm your man.

54:43.714 --> 54:46.150
And I can wield this baby,
no problem.

54:46.183 --> 54:48.085
(laughs nervously)
He knows this should
only be handled

54:48.118 --> 54:49.587
by a responsible adult.

54:49.620 --> 54:52.256
-Ooh, pointy.
-And who might you be?

54:52.289 --> 54:53.858
Name's Brill. Born of the dirt,
live in the dirt,

54:53.891 --> 54:56.226
will be buried in the dirt.
Don't like water.

55:01.198 --> 55:03.768
-(exclaims, grunts)
-(Arthur gasps)

55:03.801 --> 55:05.370
Hmm.

55:05.403 --> 55:07.171
We call him Buckethead.

55:07.204 --> 55:09.374
He's not too bright, but he can
take a lot of punishment.

55:09.407 --> 55:11.942
Impressive.

55:11.976 --> 55:13.811
You're hired!

55:13.844 --> 55:15.145
Buckethead, you're with me.

55:15.179 --> 55:18.549
Ah, now, don't be jelly, Davey.

55:22.052 --> 55:23.788
Whoa.

55:23.821 --> 55:25.390
What is this place?

55:25.423 --> 55:27.625
CHELSEA:
The Well of Seas.

55:27.658 --> 55:30.828
The source of all
the ocean's energy.

55:30.861 --> 55:33.564
That's where your mother hid
the Trident of Oceanus.

55:33.598 --> 55:36.000
She did? How did you know that?

55:36.033 --> 55:38.803
Because she took it from
my mother, the mermaid queen,

55:38.836 --> 55:40.137
and hid it in there.

55:40.170 --> 55:43.240
My mom died
trying to get it back.

55:43.273 --> 55:44.542
I am so sorry.

55:44.575 --> 55:46.076
It's not your fault.

55:46.110 --> 55:47.945
They were enemies.

55:49.847 --> 55:51.416
So how are we supposed
to get it?

55:51.449 --> 55:54.552
Each current has its own force,
its own power.

55:54.585 --> 55:56.587
You have to swim through
all of the currents

55:56.621 --> 55:59.590
to get to the center
where the Trident is hidden.

55:59.624 --> 56:02.226
Only a giant kraken
can survive it.

56:02.259 --> 56:04.862
It has to be you, Ruby.

56:05.896 --> 56:07.331
Okay.

56:07.364 --> 56:09.934
It's just an underwater
volcano of death.

56:09.967 --> 56:14.104
So, step one:
Evaluate the problem.

56:16.574 --> 56:18.709
(grunting)

56:20.611 --> 56:21.546
(gasps)

56:30.921 --> 56:32.723
Okay. The problem is bad.

56:32.757 --> 56:34.892
It's really bad.

56:34.925 --> 56:38.596
Uh, we might need some help.

56:38.629 --> 56:41.566
*

56:41.599 --> 56:44.902
Ruby. Oh, what a surprise.

56:44.935 --> 56:46.471
Show me how to use my powers.

56:46.504 --> 56:49.406
Oh, I thought you'd never ask.

56:49.440 --> 56:51.241
*

56:52.477 --> 56:54.111
RUBY:
Okay, where do we start?

56:54.144 --> 56:56.080
-Laser eyes?
-Before you fly
through the ocean,

56:56.113 --> 56:57.715
you must first learn to swim.

56:57.748 --> 56:59.049
You know my swimming
is pretty good,

56:59.083 --> 57:00.951
so maybe I could skip ahead

57:00.985 --> 57:03.721
and we could
unleash my laser eyes.

57:03.754 --> 57:05.523
Pew, pew. Pew, pew.

57:06.190 --> 57:08.459
Whoa. (grunting)

57:08.493 --> 57:10.661
You must accept
your "kraken-ness"

57:10.695 --> 57:13.330
and leave your land self behind.

57:15.332 --> 57:16.767
Uh, whoa.

57:19.369 --> 57:22.473
* Good night, stress,
see you in the mornin' *

57:23.508 --> 57:24.609
-Yay!
-* Oh *

57:24.642 --> 57:25.910
* I don't gotta guess *

57:25.943 --> 57:27.311
* You're always there for me *

57:27.344 --> 57:29.780
-(gasps)
-* Oh *

57:29.814 --> 57:31.315
* Sowin' them seeds of doubt *

57:31.348 --> 57:34.351
* I think you like
seeing me freak out *

57:34.384 --> 57:37.855
* Good night, stress,
I'll see you in mornin' *

57:39.289 --> 57:41.191
* So I wake up,
I get out of bed *

57:41.225 --> 57:43.260
-(gasps, grunts)
-* Stay up

57:43.293 --> 57:44.829
* Stay out of my head

57:44.862 --> 57:46.363
-* 'Cause it's dangerous *
-(yelling)

57:46.396 --> 57:48.533
* And I don't wanna
lose my mind, no *

57:48.566 --> 57:49.834
CHELSEA:
Ooh.

57:49.867 --> 57:51.536
* I just wanna shine

57:51.569 --> 57:54.104
* Like the sun
when it comes up... *

57:54.138 --> 57:55.439
A giant kraken's
greatest weapon...

57:55.472 --> 57:56.841
Laser eyes?

57:56.874 --> 57:58.643
No. It's our strength.

57:58.676 --> 58:00.778
Both inner and outer.

58:00.811 --> 58:02.847
(strained grunting)

58:03.881 --> 58:05.516
Mmm.

58:05.550 --> 58:06.951
Now you can say it.

58:06.984 --> 58:09.353
BOTH:
Laser eyes.

58:09.386 --> 58:12.322
The first step is to summon
your passionate fury.

58:12.356 --> 58:15.225
Passionate fury?
Like when my locker jams
right before class.

58:15.259 --> 58:16.493
Dig deeper.

58:16.527 --> 58:17.695
My friends ditching me for prom.

58:17.728 --> 58:18.829
Deeper.

58:18.863 --> 58:22.066
When my mom lies to my face!

58:22.099 --> 58:24.835
(cries out)
How do you shut them off?

58:24.869 --> 58:27.137
*

58:27.171 --> 58:29.339
Have you guys seen Ruby?

58:29.373 --> 58:30.841
No, not really.

58:30.875 --> 58:34.144
Gasp. A rose.

58:34.178 --> 58:35.913
* I already had those

58:35.946 --> 58:37.381
* Oh *

58:37.414 --> 58:39.984
* I'm just trying
to figure out *

58:40.017 --> 58:41.686
* How to be myself right now

58:41.719 --> 58:45.389
* I don't wanna lay low
hiding in the shadows *

58:46.523 --> 58:47.692
* So I wake up

58:47.725 --> 58:49.159
-Whoa.
-* I get out of bed

58:49.193 --> 58:50.595
* Stay up

58:50.628 --> 58:52.329
-(screaming)
-* Stay out of my head

58:52.362 --> 58:53.898
-(alarm ringing)
-* 'Cause it's dangerous *

58:53.931 --> 58:56.033
* And I don't wanna lose
my mind, no... *

58:56.066 --> 58:57.868
(grunts)

58:57.902 --> 59:01.238
Ruby, I see in you
a heart as big as the ocean.

59:01.271 --> 59:05.109
Honey, a thick skin
is a queen's ultimate defense.

59:05.142 --> 59:06.677
Body armor.

59:06.711 --> 59:09.747
Whoa. That's almost cooler
than laser eyes.

59:09.780 --> 59:11.048
Almost.

59:12.082 --> 59:13.884
-GORDON: Kraken! Kraken!
-(zapping)

59:13.918 --> 59:15.686
Kraken! Kraken ahoy!

59:15.720 --> 59:16.954
BOY:
Hey.

59:18.388 --> 59:22.559
Ruby? We have been looking
all over for you.

59:22.593 --> 59:25.630
So much for squad solidarity.

59:25.663 --> 59:27.665
*

59:35.673 --> 59:37.474
(song ends)

59:37.507 --> 59:39.576
(water rushing)

59:46.651 --> 59:48.919
(strained grunting)

59:50.087 --> 59:51.622
BOY:
A freak from the deep shows up,

59:51.656 --> 59:53.323
and I'm supposed to learn math?

59:53.357 --> 59:55.793
GRANDMAMAH: You're a kraken
hiding as a human.

59:55.826 --> 59:57.762
AGATHA: If you stay on dry land,
you'll stay small.

59:57.795 --> 59:59.063
CONNOR:
That thing is a monster.

59:59.096 --> 01:00:01.098
A real-life monster.

01:00:01.131 --> 01:00:03.367
(screaming)

01:00:04.301 --> 01:00:06.203
(grunts) Whoa!

01:00:08.939 --> 01:00:10.274
Whoa!

01:00:10.307 --> 01:00:11.976
(grunts)

01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:14.311
(frustrated groaning)

01:00:14.344 --> 01:00:16.781
(sighs)

01:00:16.814 --> 01:00:19.149
So... can you get it?

01:00:19.183 --> 01:00:21.151
I was so close. I could see it.

01:00:21.185 --> 01:00:23.688
Well, then how did your mom
make it through?

01:00:23.721 --> 01:00:25.255
I don't know.

01:00:25.289 --> 01:00:27.457
But I guess
I'll have to do something

01:00:27.491 --> 01:00:28.959
I never thought I'd do.

01:00:28.993 --> 01:00:29.960
What's that?

01:00:29.994 --> 01:00:32.196
Ask my mom for advice.

01:00:32.229 --> 01:00:36.466
* There once was a ship
that put to sea *

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:39.136
* The name of the ship
was Billy of Tea *

01:00:39.169 --> 01:00:40.204
(Sam laughing)

01:00:40.237 --> 01:00:41.438
* The wind blew up...

01:00:41.471 --> 01:00:43.741
Argh! What is going on
down there?

01:00:44.975 --> 01:00:46.711
First, you burned out
me engines.

01:00:46.744 --> 01:00:48.779
Then you clogged up
my bilge pump.

01:00:48.813 --> 01:00:51.816
And now we've been
off course for hours.

01:00:51.849 --> 01:00:53.818
Now, where is my kraken?

01:00:53.851 --> 01:00:55.619
Kraken ahoy.

01:00:55.652 --> 01:00:58.288
-Sam, that's our signal.
It's go time.
-Got it.

01:00:58.322 --> 01:01:00.524
Davey, cue music!

01:01:00.557 --> 01:01:02.226
* It is the night

01:01:02.259 --> 01:01:04.328
* My body's weak... *

01:01:04.361 --> 01:01:07.798
There'll be no escaping
this time!

01:01:07.832 --> 01:01:10.000
* I've got to ride... *

01:01:10.034 --> 01:01:12.202
(straining)

01:01:12.236 --> 01:01:13.570
(grunting)

01:01:16.373 --> 01:01:18.475
Wow. Gordon, you did it.

01:01:18.508 --> 01:01:20.177
You've slayed the beast!

01:01:20.210 --> 01:01:24.514
And here's your proof,
the kraken's baby itself.

01:01:24.548 --> 01:01:26.717
But it's so tiny.

01:01:26.751 --> 01:01:28.252
ARTHUR:
Careful.

01:01:28.285 --> 01:01:31.588
The babies are the most deadly.

01:01:31.621 --> 01:01:33.057
Deadly?

01:01:33.090 --> 01:01:36.226
But it looks almost, uh, cute.

01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:38.763
Ah, Davey! Davey!

01:01:38.796 --> 01:01:39.897
Oh, no.

01:01:39.930 --> 01:01:41.365
(screaming)
Don't kill me.

01:01:41.398 --> 01:01:44.034
Oh, please don't kill me,
kraken monster!

01:01:44.068 --> 01:01:46.070
(chittering weakly)

01:01:47.037 --> 01:01:49.106
(panting)

01:01:49.139 --> 01:01:51.575
Oh, I did it.

01:01:51.608 --> 01:01:53.778
I survived a deadly
kraken baby attack.

01:01:53.811 --> 01:01:56.246
Oh, finally, I've got my proof.

01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:57.882
(cackles)

01:01:57.915 --> 01:02:00.885
Wouldn't want to divorce me
now, would ya, Tammy?

01:02:00.918 --> 01:02:03.020
Cabin boy, take a picture.

01:02:03.053 --> 01:02:04.855
This is for all my haters.

01:02:04.889 --> 01:02:07.424
Your one-star reviews
mean nothing.

01:02:07.457 --> 01:02:10.795
Boys, this calls for
a celebratory sea chantey.

01:02:10.828 --> 01:02:13.263
You go low.
* I'll go high. *

01:02:13.297 --> 01:02:16.566
-(chittering)
-Nessie, you tiny genius.

01:02:17.567 --> 01:02:20.270
Ooh, I'm so nervous
to meet your mom.

01:02:20.304 --> 01:02:22.439
She's gonna know that
I'm a mermaid right away.

01:02:22.472 --> 01:02:24.775
How's my hair?
Feels like it's frizzing up,

01:02:24.809 --> 01:02:27.544
and you can't trust a person
with frizz, Ruby.

01:02:27.577 --> 01:02:30.380
Chelsea, you're my super
sea-girl bestie.

01:02:30.414 --> 01:02:31.816
It's gonna be fine.

01:02:31.849 --> 01:02:34.151
-No fighting.
-No hiding.

01:02:34.184 --> 01:02:36.821
(phone chiming)

01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:42.059
-(phone beeps)
-(exhales heavily)

01:02:42.092 --> 01:02:43.327
BRILL:
A stick snack?

01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:44.594
-A stick snack?
-Get your stick snack.

01:02:44.628 --> 01:02:45.996
Can I offer you a stick snack?

01:02:46.030 --> 01:02:47.564
Stick snack for he?
Stick snack for she?

01:02:47.597 --> 01:02:49.399
Hey, Gary. Make sure you
check out the pool house.

01:02:49.433 --> 01:02:51.936
Oh, Agatha, you were right.
What was I ever worried about?

01:02:51.969 --> 01:02:54.771
I told you, Carol.
There's no better place
to raise a family.

01:02:54.805 --> 01:02:56.106
Now, if you'll excuse me.

01:02:57.141 --> 01:02:58.976
There she is.

01:02:59.009 --> 01:03:00.677
Aggie, I'm so proud of you.

01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:02.612
This is everything you've
worked for all these years.

01:03:02.646 --> 01:03:04.448
Well, I couldn't have done it
without my...

01:03:04.481 --> 01:03:05.916
(whispering):
kraken crew.

01:03:05.950 --> 01:03:07.952
-(chuckling)
-Say, have you heard from...

01:03:07.985 --> 01:03:09.753
Ruby. Hey, stranger.

01:03:09.786 --> 01:03:11.288
I knew you'd make it.

01:03:11.321 --> 01:03:13.457
Mom, I need to talk to you
about something big.

01:03:13.490 --> 01:03:14.458
Is it about prom? Because...

01:03:14.491 --> 01:03:17.361
No. And yes. But no.

01:03:17.394 --> 01:03:19.997
It's about something
so much more than prom.

01:03:20.030 --> 01:03:22.499
The ocean. Peace. Happiness.

01:03:22.532 --> 01:03:24.434
We want all the same stuff
you wanted,

01:03:24.468 --> 01:03:25.870
and we have a plan.

01:03:25.903 --> 01:03:28.038
-But we need your help.
-We?

01:03:28.072 --> 01:03:30.941
I want you to meet my super
sea-girl bestie, Chelsea.

01:03:30.975 --> 01:03:32.209
-(girl mumbling)
-Ah.

01:03:32.242 --> 01:03:33.777
What is going on, Ruby?

01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:35.445
Before you freak out,
she is a mermaid,

01:03:35.479 --> 01:03:36.713
but you're gonna love her.

01:03:37.747 --> 01:03:39.483
Inside. Now.

01:03:39.516 --> 01:03:41.018
Ruby, you have to listen to me.

01:03:41.051 --> 01:03:43.053
You don't understand
the danger you're in.

01:03:43.087 --> 01:03:45.489
We left the ocean
because of a mermaid.

01:03:45.522 --> 01:03:47.191
Don't worry.
She's not like her mom.

01:03:47.224 --> 01:03:49.159
-Her mom?
-The mermaid queen.

01:03:49.193 --> 01:03:51.661
She's the mermaid queen's
daughter?

01:03:51.695 --> 01:03:53.297
Yeah, but she's my friend.

01:03:53.330 --> 01:03:55.332
She is not your friend.
She is dangerous.

01:03:55.365 --> 01:03:57.367
(sighs)
You sound like Grandmamah.

01:03:57.401 --> 01:04:00.170
I'm sorry. I sound like who?

01:04:00.204 --> 01:04:01.872
Grandmamah.
She's been training me.

01:04:01.906 --> 01:04:03.807
She told me why you left.

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:05.809
Training you? For what?

01:04:05.842 --> 01:04:09.179
Mom, don't you see? This is
our chance to fix everything.

01:04:09.213 --> 01:04:11.348
Ruby, you are in over your head.

01:04:11.381 --> 01:04:13.217
You do not know
the whole story.

01:04:13.250 --> 01:04:14.718
And whose fault is that?

01:04:14.751 --> 01:04:16.086
Hey, I tried to talk to you.

01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:17.321
I wanted to tell you
everything sooner,

01:04:17.354 --> 01:04:18.989
but I also needed
to keep you safe

01:04:19.023 --> 01:04:20.524
and give you a normal life.

01:04:20.557 --> 01:04:22.993
Normal? Normal isn't hiding
in this fake town,

01:04:23.027 --> 01:04:24.594
living a fake life.

01:04:24.628 --> 01:04:27.364
I sacrificed everything
to give you this "fake life."

01:04:27.397 --> 01:04:29.599
I'm not gonna hide anymore!

01:04:29.633 --> 01:04:30.600
(crackling)

01:04:30.634 --> 01:04:32.202
Oh. No, no, no, no, no.

01:04:32.236 --> 01:04:33.270
Brill!

01:04:34.304 --> 01:04:36.106
Distraction.

01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:38.775
Hey, everybody. Um, watch how
high I can throw my nephew.

01:04:40.277 --> 01:04:42.012
-(Sam screaming)
-(partygoers gasping)

01:04:42.046 --> 01:04:43.180
MAN:
Where'd he go?

01:04:43.213 --> 01:04:44.448
(screaming continues)

01:04:44.481 --> 01:04:45.749
-(Brill grunts)
-(Arthur gasps)

01:04:45.782 --> 01:04:46.883
(partygoers exclaiming)

01:04:46.917 --> 01:04:48.585
Ta-da!

01:04:48.618 --> 01:04:51.255
(laughing and cheering)

01:04:51.288 --> 01:04:54.724
We are gonna change the world
with or without you.

01:04:54.758 --> 01:04:56.393
Ruby, I get it. You're angry.

01:04:56.426 --> 01:04:57.461
You want to fight.

01:04:57.494 --> 01:04:58.929
So did I when I was your age.

01:04:58.963 --> 01:05:01.098
But trust me,
this is the wrong fight.

01:05:01.131 --> 01:05:02.632
You're on the wrong side.

01:05:02.666 --> 01:05:04.434
You can't tell me
how to live my life.

01:05:04.468 --> 01:05:06.870
Oh, yes, I can.
I am still your mother.

01:05:06.903 --> 01:05:08.939
You are forbidden
from going in the ocean again.

01:05:08.973 --> 01:05:10.874
Now go home and calm down!

01:05:10.907 --> 01:05:13.043
(Ruby yelling)

01:05:13.077 --> 01:05:14.844
(Ruby screaming)

01:05:15.579 --> 01:05:17.614
*

01:05:21.651 --> 01:05:23.853
Agatha, are you okay?

01:05:24.854 --> 01:05:26.456
(clattering)

01:05:30.027 --> 01:05:31.628
What happened?

01:05:31.661 --> 01:05:33.163
Ruby's made friends
with Nerissa's daughter.

01:05:33.197 --> 01:05:34.564
Oh, no.

01:05:34.598 --> 01:05:36.967
And my mother
has been training her.

01:05:37.001 --> 01:05:38.568
(gasps)

01:05:38.602 --> 01:05:42.772
15 years, and she still
has her tentacles around me.

01:05:42.806 --> 01:05:43.907
What about Ruby?

01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:45.809
Oh, she hates me right now.

01:05:45.842 --> 01:05:47.777
(sighs)
Go find her.

01:05:47.811 --> 01:05:49.846
Make sure she's safe.

01:05:49.879 --> 01:05:52.382
I'm gonna deal with my mother.

01:05:55.119 --> 01:05:56.987
*

01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:01.791
Ruby, wait.

01:06:01.825 --> 01:06:04.261
Are you okay?
What happened back there?

01:06:04.294 --> 01:06:06.463
My mom just wants things
to stay the same.

01:06:06.496 --> 01:06:08.932
She wants me to stay the same.

01:06:08.965 --> 01:06:11.668
But this time,
I'm not turning back.

01:06:17.641 --> 01:06:19.709
*

01:06:23.347 --> 01:06:25.049
AGATHA:
Mother!

01:06:28.852 --> 01:06:31.988
And here I thought I knew
how to make an entrance.

01:06:32.022 --> 01:06:34.458
Stay away from my daughter.

01:06:34.491 --> 01:06:36.293
You mean my granddaughter?

01:06:36.326 --> 01:06:38.728
The princess?
The heir to the throne?

01:06:38.762 --> 01:06:40.330
Still trying to get your way.

01:06:40.364 --> 01:06:42.532
(scoffs):
Some things never change.

01:06:42.566 --> 01:06:43.733
You're trying to force
your daughter

01:06:43.767 --> 01:06:45.902
into a life she doesn't want.

01:06:45.935 --> 01:06:48.205
Now, where have I heard
that before?

01:06:48.238 --> 01:06:50.707
The difference is
I didn't raise my daughter

01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:52.509
to be a reflection of my glory.

01:06:52.542 --> 01:06:53.977
Well, that's certainly true.

01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:56.846
You raised her to run away
and hide.

01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:58.982
You still think
I was scared to fight.

01:06:59.015 --> 01:07:01.151
You think it was easy
to start over?

01:07:01.185 --> 01:07:02.552
To risk everything?

01:07:02.586 --> 01:07:04.488
I never stopped fighting.

01:07:04.521 --> 01:07:06.556
I fight for my family.

01:07:06.590 --> 01:07:08.192
I fight for who I love.

01:07:08.225 --> 01:07:09.559
You?

01:07:09.593 --> 01:07:10.927
You just love to fight!

01:07:11.961 --> 01:07:13.997
She's just a kid.

01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:16.032
A sweet, naive kid.

01:07:16.066 --> 01:07:17.867
And now she's in trouble.

01:07:17.901 --> 01:07:19.836
She made friends
with a mermaid.

01:07:19.869 --> 01:07:21.105
-What?
-Yes.

01:07:21.138 --> 01:07:22.606
The daughter
of the mermaid queen.

01:07:22.639 --> 01:07:24.874
Daughter? Nerissa never
had a daughter.

01:07:24.908 --> 01:07:26.076
(gasps)

01:07:26.110 --> 01:07:27.377
Ruby.

01:07:27.411 --> 01:07:29.446
*

01:07:42.392 --> 01:07:44.161
*

01:07:45.129 --> 01:07:47.164
(water rushing)

01:07:52.936 --> 01:07:55.172
(sound quiets)

01:08:01.845 --> 01:08:03.647
(gasping)

01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:05.782
*

01:08:11.288 --> 01:08:12.989
We did it.

01:08:14.458 --> 01:08:18.628
I've waited 15 years for this.

01:08:20.330 --> 01:08:24.401
15 years of waiting to get
revenge on your mother...

01:08:24.434 --> 01:08:25.435
What?

01:08:25.469 --> 01:08:27.504
...dethrone your grandmother

01:08:27.537 --> 01:08:30.474
and lay waste
to the kraken kingdom.

01:08:30.507 --> 01:08:31.775
Chelsea?

01:08:31.808 --> 01:08:34.911
(chuckles)
Oh, there is no Chelsea.

01:08:34.944 --> 01:08:39.015
I am Nerissa.

01:08:39.048 --> 01:08:40.784
What's...
What's happening to you?

01:08:40.817 --> 01:08:42.819
Surprised?

01:08:42.852 --> 01:08:44.854
(as Chelsea):
I'm a flippin' mermaid.

01:08:44.888 --> 01:08:46.623
-(grunts)
-(Ruby screams)

01:08:46.656 --> 01:08:49.493
NERISSA: And you're just
a dumb teenager.

01:08:51.528 --> 01:08:55.131
All that rah-rah-rah
was so that you could free this

01:08:55.165 --> 01:08:56.866
for me, me, me.

01:08:56.900 --> 01:08:59.303
(as Chelsea):
My super sea-girl bestie.

01:08:59.336 --> 01:09:00.937
I trusted you.

01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:03.973
You just got played, dum-dum.

01:09:04.007 --> 01:09:05.675
-(Ruby grunts)
-* Ra-tat-tat-tat

01:09:05.709 --> 01:09:07.811
* Ra-tat-tat-tat,
ra-tat-tat-tat *

01:09:07.844 --> 01:09:09.446
* Ra-tat-tat-tat

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:11.681
* Ra-tat-tat-tat,
ra-tat-tat-tat *

01:09:11.715 --> 01:09:13.217
-(laughing)
-* Straight to ya

01:09:13.250 --> 01:09:15.619
* Straight to ya,
straight to ya dome like *

01:09:15.652 --> 01:09:17.287
(gasps)

01:09:17.321 --> 01:09:19.155
* I bring the pain like,
pain like, pain like... *

01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:21.458
(song fades)

01:09:21.491 --> 01:09:25.195
("Moon Man" by Balu Brigada
playing in distance)

01:09:25.229 --> 01:09:30.567
* So I'll be your man
on the moon *

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:33.503
(excited chattering
and laughter)

01:09:33.537 --> 01:09:36.740
* I'll be your man on the moon *

01:09:36.773 --> 01:09:40.544
* Ah-ah, ah-ah *

01:09:40.577 --> 01:09:44.548
* If I can't get closer to you *

01:09:44.581 --> 01:09:47.150
* Ah-ah, ah-ah... *

01:09:47.183 --> 01:09:49.219
(song fades)

01:09:53.790 --> 01:09:56.192
(burbling)

01:09:56.226 --> 01:09:58.127
*

01:10:02.699 --> 01:10:05.068
(tires screeching)

01:10:07.937 --> 01:10:10.039
(maniacal laughter)

01:10:12.041 --> 01:10:14.244
(whistle blowing)

01:10:14.278 --> 01:10:17.281
(students screaming, shouting)

01:10:17.314 --> 01:10:20.049
-(panicked screaming)
-(gasps) The face of death.

01:10:22.952 --> 01:10:24.754
Oh, no.

01:10:25.889 --> 01:10:27.090
(whimpering)

01:10:31.295 --> 01:10:32.896
Hello?

01:10:32.929 --> 01:10:34.798
Is Mrs. Gillman home?

01:10:34.831 --> 01:10:37.267
Knock, knock!

01:10:37.301 --> 01:10:39.603
Hey! That house was in escrow!

01:10:39.636 --> 01:10:41.605
-WOMAN: Run! Run!
-To the boat, Davey.

01:10:41.638 --> 01:10:43.239
There's kraken to kill.

01:10:43.273 --> 01:10:44.608
-Wait!
-Gillman.

01:10:44.641 --> 01:10:46.242
Are you here to help me
kill the monsters?

01:10:46.276 --> 01:10:48.478
-No. That's my wife.
-What?

01:10:48.512 --> 01:10:51.581
But if she is a...
and-and you're her...

01:10:51.615 --> 01:10:53.550
that means...

01:10:53.583 --> 01:10:56.586
Please don't kill me,
kraken monster.

01:10:56.620 --> 01:10:58.121
Pull yourself together, man.

01:10:58.154 --> 01:10:59.589
We've got a mermaid to hunt.

01:10:59.623 --> 01:11:01.791
Thanks. I needed that.

01:11:01.825 --> 01:11:03.793
Where is my daughter?

01:11:03.827 --> 01:11:05.662
Oh, we already said
our goodbyes.

01:11:05.695 --> 01:11:09.733
But not before
she gave me this.

01:11:09.766 --> 01:11:12.101
(Nerissa laughing)

01:11:12.135 --> 01:11:14.404
The greatest warrior
in the sea,

01:11:14.438 --> 01:11:16.673
hiding amongst humans.

01:11:16.706 --> 01:11:18.207
What a waste.

01:11:19.343 --> 01:11:22.111
No one talks to my daughter
like that.

01:11:22.145 --> 01:11:23.947
-Except me.
-(Agatha sighs)

01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:26.015
You've grown older, Queen.

01:11:26.049 --> 01:11:28.284
Older and meaner.

01:11:28.318 --> 01:11:31.287
Lucky for me,
mermaids don't age.

01:11:31.321 --> 01:11:34.290
Well, I hope you both put up
more of a fight than Ruby.

01:11:35.191 --> 01:11:36.560
(all yelling)

01:11:38.294 --> 01:11:41.465
Ruby? Ruby?

01:11:42.532 --> 01:11:44.167
(Ruby crying, sniffling)

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:46.035
Ruby!

01:11:47.537 --> 01:11:49.138
Don't worry.
I'll get you out of here...

01:11:49.172 --> 01:11:51.140
(straining):
...slowly.

01:11:51.174 --> 01:11:53.543
I will get you out
of here slowly.

01:11:55.812 --> 01:11:57.481
Oh, no.

01:11:57.514 --> 01:12:00.016
-What happened?
-(Ruby sighs)

01:12:00.049 --> 01:12:02.886
Getting the Trident was
supposed to make things better,

01:12:02.919 --> 01:12:05.321
but all I did
was ruin everything.

01:12:05.355 --> 01:12:07.323
My mom was right.

01:12:07.357 --> 01:12:09.959
I should have just gone home
like she said... (sniffles)

01:12:09.993 --> 01:12:13.029
...gone back to hiding
and stayed small.

01:12:13.062 --> 01:12:15.732
What? No. Ruby,
that's not what your mom meant.

01:12:15.765 --> 01:12:17.233
I promise.

01:12:17.266 --> 01:12:18.868
You weren't there.

01:12:18.902 --> 01:12:20.670
Well, I may not know a lot
about a lot,

01:12:20.704 --> 01:12:22.472
but I know my sister.

01:12:22.506 --> 01:12:25.375
Growing up, I was so proud
to be her brother.

01:12:25.409 --> 01:12:27.644
She was powerful, confident.

01:12:27.677 --> 01:12:29.245
Everyone loved her.

01:12:29.278 --> 01:12:31.681
But then she left,

01:12:31.715 --> 01:12:33.182
and I could never understand

01:12:33.216 --> 01:12:35.685
why she chose to leave
the ocean

01:12:35.719 --> 01:12:39.556
until I saw the awesome life
she created on land.

01:12:39.589 --> 01:12:43.960
And I realized,
your mom chose her own path.

01:12:44.794 --> 01:12:47.230
She chose you.

01:12:48.197 --> 01:12:50.233
*

01:12:54.270 --> 01:12:55.805
(rumbling)

01:13:02.979 --> 01:13:05.048
(rumbling)

01:13:07.050 --> 01:13:09.118
*

01:13:15.725 --> 01:13:19.696
It's time to destroy
that Trident once and for all.

01:13:19.729 --> 01:13:21.965
Yeah! Go get her, kiddo!

01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:25.435
-(whoosh)
-Whoa!

01:13:30.574 --> 01:13:32.842
I'll be right there.

01:13:35.144 --> 01:13:37.013
Don't wait up, though.

01:13:38.982 --> 01:13:42.151
(yelps, grunts)

01:13:42.185 --> 01:13:43.653
-(Grandmamah grunts)
-(crackling)

01:13:43.687 --> 01:13:45.254
(Nerissa yells)

01:13:45.288 --> 01:13:46.656
-(Agatha grunts)
-(crackling)

01:13:46.690 --> 01:13:49.158
(laughing): Oh, it feels
so good to be back.

01:13:49.192 --> 01:13:50.794
And this time,

01:13:50.827 --> 01:13:54.363
I'm getting rid of you
for good.

01:13:57.300 --> 01:13:59.002
Stay away from my mother!

01:13:59.035 --> 01:14:01.237
Ruby Gillman?

01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:04.040
(gasps)
Pause. Rewind. Ruby?

01:14:05.108 --> 01:14:06.843
You should be dead.

01:14:06.876 --> 01:14:08.444
Picture this.

01:14:08.478 --> 01:14:12.448
Quirky girl fulfills destiny
by foiling fake friend!

01:14:12.482 --> 01:14:14.083
-(Nerissa grunts)
-(students gasp)

01:14:14.117 --> 01:14:16.586
* Believer

01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:18.988
* Took me over like a fever

01:14:20.123 --> 01:14:22.792
* Caught you hiding
in the smoke... *

01:14:22.826 --> 01:14:24.093
What is she doing?

01:14:24.127 --> 01:14:26.029
Answering the call.

01:14:26.062 --> 01:14:28.131
(Nerissa laughing)

01:14:28.164 --> 01:14:30.366
(both grunting)

01:14:30.399 --> 01:14:34.638
* Ooh

01:14:34.671 --> 01:14:39.208
* Lay your red hand
on me, baby *

01:14:39.242 --> 01:14:42.946
* Ooh, ooh

01:14:42.979 --> 01:14:46.650
* As I go

01:14:46.683 --> 01:14:49.352
*

01:14:54.991 --> 01:14:56.560
(students screaming)

01:14:56.593 --> 01:14:58.862
(laughing)

01:14:58.895 --> 01:15:00.063
Leave my sister alone.

01:15:01.097 --> 01:15:02.065
(cries out)

01:15:02.098 --> 01:15:03.867
(panting)

01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:06.636
Aw, yeah.
That's what I'm talking about.

01:15:06.670 --> 01:15:09.405
Doug, that's our house.

01:15:12.341 --> 01:15:15.444
Enough with these
childish games.

01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:19.148
I hate high school.

01:15:19.182 --> 01:15:21.017
(Ruby cries out)

01:15:21.050 --> 01:15:22.686
(students screaming)

01:15:22.719 --> 01:15:27.090
If this is our end,
then we'll face it unafraid!

01:15:27.123 --> 01:15:28.758
(whistles blowing)

01:15:28.792 --> 01:15:30.894
* Into the sea

01:15:30.927 --> 01:15:33.897
* Out of fire

01:15:33.930 --> 01:15:37.601
* All that burning

01:15:37.634 --> 01:15:40.036
* Into the sea

01:15:40.069 --> 01:15:42.105
* Out of fire

01:15:42.138 --> 01:15:45.942
* All that burning

01:15:45.975 --> 01:15:48.044
-* Into the sea
-(straining)

01:15:48.077 --> 01:15:50.179
* Out of fire

01:15:50.213 --> 01:15:52.949
* All that burning...

01:15:52.982 --> 01:15:56.452
(cheering)

01:15:57.887 --> 01:16:00.256
-Ruby, behind you!
-(Nerissa yells)

01:16:01.725 --> 01:16:04.427
You'll never win, Ruby Gillman.

01:16:05.662 --> 01:16:08.031
You're just a dumb teenager.

01:16:08.064 --> 01:16:10.767
You know what's really pathetic?

01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:12.736
That you thought someone like me

01:16:12.769 --> 01:16:16.606
could ever be friends
with a monster like you.

01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:19.308
I am not a monster.

01:16:19.342 --> 01:16:20.610
I'm a kraken.

01:16:29.185 --> 01:16:31.955
Mom, we need to shoot
the Trident together.

01:16:31.988 --> 01:16:33.757
No, it-it can't be destroyed.

01:16:33.790 --> 01:16:35.324
That's... that's why I hid it.

01:16:35.358 --> 01:16:38.127
We can do it if we join together
at the same time.

01:16:38.161 --> 01:16:40.897
It's the exponential
growth formula.

01:16:40.930 --> 01:16:43.432
We've got to shoot it more
and longer.

01:16:43.466 --> 01:16:45.401
Trust me, I'm a mathlete.

01:16:45.434 --> 01:16:47.971
(Nerissa yelling)

01:16:48.004 --> 01:16:50.306
(grunting)

01:16:57.446 --> 01:16:59.482
It doesn't have to end
like this.

01:16:59.515 --> 01:17:01.785
Just give up the Trident.

01:17:01.818 --> 01:17:04.320
You'll never get this
away from me.

01:17:04.353 --> 01:17:07.791
Maybe I can't, but we can.

01:17:07.824 --> 01:17:10.593
(gasps, grunts)

01:17:10.626 --> 01:17:13.062
*

01:17:17.801 --> 01:17:19.836
(straining)

01:17:25.208 --> 01:17:28.344
-(gasps) No!
-(lasers warbling)

01:17:28.377 --> 01:17:29.679
(explosion)

01:17:29.713 --> 01:17:31.314
(exclaiming)

01:17:31.347 --> 01:17:33.449
(whooshing)

01:17:33.482 --> 01:17:34.617
(screaming)

01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:37.286
*

01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:39.355
(people cheering)

01:17:41.490 --> 01:17:43.793
-Woo-hoo!
-(laughing)

01:17:43.827 --> 01:17:45.795
(chittering happily)

01:17:45.829 --> 01:17:46.696
MARGOT:
Go, Ruby!

01:17:46.730 --> 01:17:48.264
(Nerissa screaming)

01:17:49.766 --> 01:17:51.534
Woo-hoo!

01:17:51.567 --> 01:17:54.670
Now, that's a successful
monster hunt.

01:17:54.704 --> 01:17:56.806
We got us
a little mermaid, Davey!

01:17:56.840 --> 01:17:58.174
Please. Please, please, please.

01:17:58.207 --> 01:17:59.876
I'm not evil.

01:17:59.909 --> 01:18:01.878
I'm just pretty...

01:18:01.911 --> 01:18:03.546
and misunderstood.

01:18:03.579 --> 01:18:05.314
(screams)

01:18:05.348 --> 01:18:07.316
Now, what about the mermaid?

01:18:07.350 --> 01:18:10.019
-Everyone likes fried fish.
-No.

01:18:10.053 --> 01:18:11.587
Away, rage.

01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:13.422
Teenagers.

01:18:13.456 --> 01:18:15.291
Away, rage.

01:18:16.359 --> 01:18:19.695
Ruby, I'm sorry.

01:18:19.729 --> 01:18:21.164
I was wrong.

01:18:21.197 --> 01:18:24.233
I should have trusted you
with the truth,

01:18:24.267 --> 01:18:27.236
and so from now on,
no more lying.

01:18:27.270 --> 01:18:29.572
And no more hiding.

01:18:34.110 --> 01:18:36.880
I think you can still make
the last dance.

01:18:42.986 --> 01:18:45.621
Now, let's talk about
her coronation.

01:18:45.654 --> 01:18:47.556
Mom, don't start.

01:18:47.590 --> 01:18:50.960
Fine. A mother knows best.

01:18:50.994 --> 01:18:52.295
(gasps)

01:18:52.328 --> 01:18:53.596
Brill's here.

01:18:53.629 --> 01:18:55.965
Mamah! What are you doing here?

01:18:55.999 --> 01:18:57.366
And with Agatha?

01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:58.734
Are-are... are you okay?
Is everyone okay?

01:18:58.768 --> 01:18:59.903
-(Grandmamah shushing)
-Is Ruby okay?

01:18:59.936 --> 01:19:02.738
It's Brill's time now.

01:19:04.573 --> 01:19:06.242
Oh.

01:19:06.275 --> 01:19:09.779
I've waited 15 years for this.

01:19:09.813 --> 01:19:12.115
Oh, who's crying?

01:19:12.148 --> 01:19:15.651
You're crying. (crying)

01:19:17.686 --> 01:19:19.655
*

01:19:32.268 --> 01:19:33.803
(applause, cheering)

01:19:33.837 --> 01:19:35.638
GIRL:
You're our hero.

01:19:35.671 --> 01:19:37.406
(excited chattering)

01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:39.108
I love you so much!

01:19:45.181 --> 01:19:47.583
-BOY: Yeah!
-BOY 2: Ruby for prom queen.

01:19:47.616 --> 01:19:49.185
GIRL:
You really saved us.

01:19:49.218 --> 01:19:51.821
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
everything sooner,

01:19:51.855 --> 01:19:53.656
and I'm sorry for ditching you.

01:19:53.689 --> 01:19:55.291
I shouldn't have lied to you.

01:19:55.324 --> 01:19:58.794
Ruby, my sweet, magnificent,
giant-sized best friend,

01:19:58.828 --> 01:20:01.597
you never ever have to hide
things from us.

01:20:01.630 --> 01:20:03.867
Yeah, we will always
be by your side,

01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:07.203
even when you almost
ended life as we know it.

01:20:07.236 --> 01:20:09.038
Sorry, no catastrophizing.

01:20:09.072 --> 01:20:12.141
Kraken, Canadian or otherwise,
we'll always love you, Rubes.

01:20:13.176 --> 01:20:14.610
Squad solidarity?

01:20:14.643 --> 01:20:16.612
ALL:
Squad solidarity.

01:20:16.645 --> 01:20:18.681
(laughing)

01:20:23.219 --> 01:20:24.888
Hey, you.

01:20:24.921 --> 01:20:27.290
Ruby. H-Hey.

01:20:27.323 --> 01:20:29.392
So, that was you out there?

01:20:29.425 --> 01:20:31.394
Guilty. (laughs nervously)

01:20:31.427 --> 01:20:33.329
-Connor...
-Ruby... Oh, you go.

01:20:33.362 --> 01:20:34.830
No, you go.

01:20:34.864 --> 01:20:37.000
Okay, I go.

01:20:37.033 --> 01:20:39.903
Connor, will you go
to prom with me?

01:20:42.171 --> 01:20:44.240
(beeping)

01:20:45.841 --> 01:20:49.478
Wait. Connor, are these
quadratic derivative graphs?

01:20:49.512 --> 01:20:52.348
Let's just say
I had a good tutor.

01:20:52.381 --> 01:20:54.350
("Praising You" by Rita Ora
feat. Fatboy Slim playing)

01:20:54.383 --> 01:20:56.986
Whoa. (laughing)

01:20:57.020 --> 01:20:58.354
Let's dance.

01:20:58.387 --> 01:21:00.356
* I have to praise you...

01:21:01.891 --> 01:21:04.393
And who is this fine
young kraken?

01:21:04.427 --> 01:21:06.362
This is Sam, our son.

01:21:06.395 --> 01:21:11.034
Son? As in,
I'm a grandmamah again?

01:21:11.067 --> 01:21:13.102
This is the coolest thing ever.

01:21:13.136 --> 01:21:14.603
Do your tentacles ooze poison?

01:21:14.637 --> 01:21:16.572
Have you ever wrestled a Hydra?

01:21:16.605 --> 01:21:19.008
Better yet,
have you ever played dodgeball?

01:21:19.042 --> 01:21:21.911
Oh, I am gonna like you.

01:21:21.945 --> 01:21:23.412
Okay, guys. Gordon here.

01:21:23.446 --> 01:21:26.382
Uh, this be my official
apology video.

01:21:26.415 --> 01:21:29.185
Look, I said some insensitive
things about the kraken.

01:21:29.218 --> 01:21:31.454
OMG, are you live streaming?

01:21:31.487 --> 01:21:33.789
-Ugh, my hair is terrible.
-Now, t...

01:21:33.822 --> 01:21:35.624
How many likes
are we getting, though?

01:21:37.226 --> 01:21:40.629
* And who knew love would
leave me feeling this good *

01:21:40.663 --> 01:21:43.532
* I have to praise you
like I should *

01:21:43.566 --> 01:21:46.802
* I have to praise you,
I have to praise you *

01:21:48.404 --> 01:21:50.139
* I have to praise you

01:21:52.141 --> 01:21:54.477
* I have to praise you

01:21:56.079 --> 01:21:58.147
* I have to praise you

01:21:59.848 --> 01:22:04.420
* I have to praise you
like I should... *

Agatha Gillman here,

01:22:05.955 --> 01:22:08.257
Realtor and kraken protector
of Oceanside.

01:22:08.291 --> 01:22:10.259
It's the safest place
to raise a family,

01:22:10.293 --> 01:22:11.627
thanks to my daughter.

01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:13.629
Welcome back to Bottled Up.

01:22:13.662 --> 01:22:16.299
This week, we're embracing
our inner seaside.

01:22:16.332 --> 01:22:18.634
Whoo. Let's get kraken.

01:22:18.667 --> 01:22:21.404
I'm taking dodgeball
to a whole new level.

01:22:21.437 --> 01:22:24.440
* I have to praise you

01:22:24.473 --> 01:22:25.574

01:22:25.608 --> 01:22:26.942
* I have to praise you

01:22:26.976 --> 01:22:28.444
I'm a legend.

01:22:28.477 --> 01:22:30.013
* But I'm always praising you *

01:22:30.046 --> 01:22:33.416
* I have to praise you
like I should... *

01:22:33.449 --> 01:22:34.683
(tires screeching)

01:22:34.717 --> 01:22:36.519
Ruby, the Devil Whale
has been spotted

01:22:36.552 --> 01:22:38.354
and is headed straight
for the kraken kingdom!

01:22:38.387 --> 01:22:40.623
Well, leading lady?

01:22:41.557 --> 01:22:43.026
Hold my books.

01:22:44.860 --> 01:22:46.662
(kisses)

01:22:46.695 --> 01:22:49.698
GRANDMAMAH:
See? I told you people.

01:22:49.732 --> 01:22:52.168
The ocean will always
need a kraken,

01:22:52.201 --> 01:22:55.804
and a kraken will always
answer the call.

01:22:55.838 --> 01:22:57.540
* You were gonna watch me

01:22:57.573 --> 01:23:00.176

01:23:00.209 --> 01:23:03.546
* Ri-i-i-i-ise...

01:23:03.579 --> 01:23:06.615
* Ri-i-i-i-ise

01:23:06.649 --> 01:23:08.051
* Hey

01:23:08.084 --> 01:23:10.319
* Rise up with the waves

01:23:10.353 --> 01:23:13.456
* I was always
somehow ashamed *

01:23:13.489 --> 01:23:16.659
* Trying to always hide
in my skin *

01:23:16.692 --> 01:23:22.065
* Now I feel the rain come
pouring down *

01:23:23.166 --> 01:23:26.069
* You always said
that I should hide it *

01:23:26.102 --> 01:23:29.405
* Don't know why
I held my light in *

01:23:29.438 --> 01:23:34.443
* Like a sapphire now
I'm shining out *

01:23:36.112 --> 01:23:38.847
* Even when it wasn't easy *

01:23:38.881 --> 01:23:42.218
* Even when you couldn't
see me *

01:23:42.251 --> 01:23:46.589
* I think I always knew
deep down inside *

01:23:46.622 --> 01:23:48.324
* You were gonna watch me

01:23:48.357 --> 01:23:51.494

* Hey

01:23:59.302 --> 01:24:01.404
* Rise up with the waves

01:24:01.437 --> 01:24:04.740
* You were always there
for me but *

01:24:04.773 --> 01:24:07.776
* Didn't know what
I was made of *

01:24:07.810 --> 01:24:10.679
* The pressure only made
this diamond *

01:24:10.713 --> 01:24:14.083
* Stronger, stronger,
stronger *

01:24:14.117 --> 01:24:17.786
* You always said that
I should hide it *

01:24:17.820 --> 01:24:20.756
* Don't know why
I held my light in *

01:24:20.789 --> 01:24:25.461

I'm shining out *

* Even when you couldn't
see me *

01:24:34.002 --> 01:24:38.107
* I think I always knew
deep down inside *

01:24:38.141 --> 01:24:39.908
* You were gonna watch me
