NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on</i> The Shield <i>:</i>

00:01.919 --> 00:04.114
Knock it off!
Got a goddamn lump.

00:04.319 --> 00:05.468
I'm not gonna let you ruin my life

00:05.679 --> 00:07.192
over this vending machine thing.
Sure you are.

00:07.399 --> 00:08.548
You are my hero.
Why is that?

00:08.759 --> 00:11.193
Hanlon. Oh, I'm sorry,
I just assumed, the way
she talks about you.

00:11.399 --> 00:13.196
So the Dutchman has a shot, then?
HIATT: Dutch? Sure.

00:13.399 --> 00:15.708
BILLINGS: He's been working
that caring-mentor angle
like there's no tomorrow.

00:15.919 --> 00:17.875
Your loss, my friend.

00:19.000 --> 00:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:30.759 --> 00:32.430
Did you talk to Shane?
He killed Lem.

00:32.639 --> 00:34.470
I did what I thought
had to be done
at the time.

00:34.679 --> 00:37.034
I see you again,
and I will kill you.

00:37.239 --> 00:39.548
SHANE:
Just imagine every wrong thing
we have ever done.

00:39.759 --> 00:42.876
Anything happens
to me or my wife
or my son...

00:44.679 --> 00:46.351
that lands on IAD's doorstep.

00:46.559 --> 00:48.868
I'm Kesakhian.
I need to speak to the real Kesakhian.

00:49.079 --> 00:50.228
My father's out of town.

00:50.439 --> 00:52.157
SHANE:
How long do you think
can keep this a secret?

00:52.359 --> 00:53.712
Long enough for a miracle.
In the meantime,

00:53.919 --> 00:54.954
you think you're running the show?

00:55.159 --> 00:56.877
You'll be my partner
in this country.

00:57.079 --> 00:58.831
Who's putting the most cash
into the peasants' pockets?

00:59.039 --> 00:59.994
DIRO:
Rezian. He runs the ports.

01:00.199 --> 01:01.757
SHANE: He's the one
who's gonna be
looking to take over.

01:01.959 --> 01:03.472
You're under arrest.
My people won't let you

01:03.679 --> 01:05.590
get away with this.
You don't have people.

01:05.799 --> 01:08.677
Kesakhian Jr.'s in charge now,
so your crew ain't happening.

01:08.879 --> 01:10.597
Sounds like Shane
made a big bust today.

01:10.799 --> 01:12.551
I don't know what
kind of arrangement
you two have,

01:12.759 --> 01:16.115
but just know when
the chips fall, they always land
on Shane's side of the table.

01:16.319 --> 01:19.311
That cop knows what's going on.
We cannot be partners.
I have to be careful.

01:19.519 --> 01:20.952
You just stay out of my way.

01:21.159 --> 01:23.593
Looking to make you
as miserable
as I possibly can.

01:23.799 --> 01:26.836
I'll stop by and say hi
when you start your
security job in Northridge.

01:27.039 --> 01:29.314
Vic stole from your father.
Your Armenian money train?

01:29.519 --> 01:31.987
Got robbed a few years back?
That was Vic.

01:32.199 --> 01:35.157
They asked me to be
a part of it. When I said no,
I became a threat.

01:35.359 --> 01:37.156
I'm gonna have
to deal with him too.

01:37.359 --> 01:38.587
Wait a second,
I didn't tell you that.

01:38.799 --> 01:40.755
But you have told me.
I must finish the job.

01:41.519 --> 01:43.316
CLAUDETTE:
San Marcos is officially closed.

01:43.519 --> 01:45.987
We got guys who wielded
the machetes, but not
the guys who ordered it.

01:46.199 --> 01:48.394
Remember the one-armed man
with the suitcase of cash?

01:48.599 --> 01:51.397
I'm a Mexican official.
Diplomatic immunity.

01:51.599 --> 01:53.908
He was present
at the San Marcos murders.

01:54.119 --> 01:57.953
We want him to stick around,
we make sure his
$230,000 luggage gets lost.

01:58.159 --> 01:59.877
And Pezuela shows up
with his arm

02:00.079 --> 02:01.637
up Aceveda's ass.
Thank you.

02:01.959 --> 02:04.154
Getting tips from prison,
representing a company

02:04.359 --> 02:05.678
with the backing
of Mexican interests?

02:05.879 --> 02:07.232
So now there's a conspiracy?

02:07.439 --> 02:08.792
VIC:
Why'd you kill those people
at San Marcos?

02:08.999 --> 02:11.957
Something big's coming up. There's
a dude by the name of Romero.

02:12.159 --> 02:15.356
We were supposed to leave him alive.
So you just cut off his arm.

02:15.559 --> 02:18.027
I understand you went to college
with Cruz Pezuela.

02:18.239 --> 02:20.514
I'm gonna use
every second to find out
what's going on here.

02:20.719 --> 02:24.109
Why those people died
and you didn't, where
that money was going.

02:24.319 --> 02:26.116
What Pezuela's angle is
on all of this.

02:26.319 --> 02:28.753
I solved this thing
before the quarterly stats
were due.

02:28.959 --> 02:31.598
You're gonna tell me that
saving this place doesn't
earn me a spot here?

02:31.799 --> 02:34.518
Nothing that happened today
is gonna change what
I have to say to the panel.

02:34.879 --> 02:36.278
I have one more picture.

02:37.679 --> 02:38.634
VIC:
That's Aceveda.

02:38.839 --> 02:42.468
Gun to his head.
Rather than stand up like a man

02:42.679 --> 02:45.068
to his attackers, he takes
a man's dick in his mouth.

02:45.279 --> 02:48.555
Don't think that'll play
too well with the voters.
Save your job.

02:48.759 --> 02:51.319
But stop digging right now.

02:54.759 --> 02:56.750
[PHONE RINGING]

03:02.759 --> 03:03.714
ACEVEDA:
Hello.

03:03.919 --> 03:05.557
VIC:
<i>I'm in your driveway.</i>
<i>Come outside.</i>

03:05.759 --> 03:09.308
What?
<i>Come outside.</i>

03:09.519 --> 03:11.510
Vic?
<i>You don't wanna have</i>

03:11.719 --> 03:14.677
<i>this conversation</i>
<i>where your wife</i>
<i>and kid could hear.</i>

03:38.559 --> 03:39.753
ACEVEDA:
What?

03:40.479 --> 03:44.313
My appeals hearing's
tomorrow night. Last chance
to save my badge.

03:44.519 --> 03:47.317
If you're looking
for a pep talk, you came
to the wrong man.

03:47.519 --> 03:49.191
No, I didn't.

03:52.599 --> 03:54.635
This is you, isn't it?

03:57.519 --> 04:01.671
What is this?
I think you know what it is.

04:02.439 --> 04:04.157
You and your boyfriend.

04:04.359 --> 04:07.510
It's a fake. Photoshop.

04:08.199 --> 04:11.316
This didn't happen.
Explain that to your voters.

04:11.519 --> 04:14.192
You think you can use
some shitty forgery
against me?

04:14.399 --> 04:16.310
Man, I'm surprised
whoever pasted this together

04:16.519 --> 04:18.271
on his computer
didn't give me tits.

04:18.478 --> 04:22.677
I'm just looking for
a little help in exchange
for bringing this to your attention.

04:23.079 --> 04:26.355
Help with your review board?
Just a nudge.

04:26.559 --> 04:28.277
Enough to keep me
at the Barn.

04:28.479 --> 04:31.312
Well, if you're gonna blackmail
someone, do it right.

04:32.439 --> 04:34.509
This picture's a fake,

04:34.719 --> 04:38.837
and any other copies
that you're gonna
hold back are fake.

05:13.919 --> 05:16.035
That your guy
down at the end
of the hallway too?

05:16.239 --> 05:19.914
I thought it'd be best.
Hospital doesn't mind the muscle?

05:20.119 --> 05:22.030
They acknowledge
my father's generosity

05:22.239 --> 05:24.992
by being sensitive
to our need for privacy.

05:25.399 --> 05:28.630
He's gotten worse.
Put him on life support.

05:28.839 --> 05:32.593
They say he has just a day or two.
I'm sorry.

05:46.199 --> 05:48.872
For you.
Your information
about the men

05:49.079 --> 05:52.196
who robbed
our money-laundering
operation is appreciated.

05:52.399 --> 05:54.594
Put a lot of unanswered
questions to rest.

05:54.799 --> 05:56.994
Look, I been wanting to talk to you
about that.

05:58.599 --> 06:02.228
Things have been pretty quiet
for your crew ever since
the feet chopping ended.

06:02.439 --> 06:03.872
You're off everybody's radar.

06:04.079 --> 06:06.468
My father worked hard
to establish that peace.

06:06.679 --> 06:09.398
Well, I think it best
if we lay low on
any kind of retaliation.

06:09.919 --> 06:11.477
You want me to do nothing?

06:11.679 --> 06:15.718
Look, a couple of cops
end up hurt, that sets things
on fire all over again.

06:15.919 --> 06:18.274
My colleagues, the feds,
they will jump in.

06:18.759 --> 06:20.272
It will hurt business.

06:20.479 --> 06:23.596
And we already
shut down your port
revenue temporarily.

06:25.479 --> 06:28.949
I have no say
in what the retaliation
will be, or when.

06:29.159 --> 06:32.117
I passed the information
to my father's associates
back home.

06:32.319 --> 06:33.547
It's entirely in their hands.

06:33.759 --> 06:35.829
Well, maybe you
need to pass along
a little more information.

06:36.039 --> 06:37.836
You tell them that they can't
just kill two cops

06:38.039 --> 06:39.677
without it wrecking everything
that we're trying to do here.

06:39.879 --> 06:41.073
Those men stole millions
from my family.

06:41.279 --> 06:44.555
I understand that,
but we gotta play
this game smart.

06:44.759 --> 06:47.353
I am not playing a game,
Shane. Are you?

06:54.159 --> 06:57.196
I'm just trying to protect
your family's long-term interest.

06:57.399 --> 06:59.629
That's what a good partner does.

07:13.119 --> 07:16.907
Detective Mackey. Benjamin Webb.
Counsel for Mr. Aceveda.

07:17.719 --> 07:18.754
How can I help you?

07:18.959 --> 07:22.269
My client so wishes
you'd exercised better
judgement earlier tonight,

07:23.279 --> 07:26.396
but you left him no choice
in responding to your threats.

07:26.599 --> 07:27.793
The truth's not a threat.

07:27.999 --> 07:29.398
Our legal remedies
will be two-pronged.

07:29.599 --> 07:32.318
A laundry list of
criminal charges
for extortion.

07:32.519 --> 07:36.353
Our civil suit will be
seeking damages for defamation
to be determined later.

07:36.559 --> 07:39.631
Since you approached my client
as a private citizen,

07:39.839 --> 07:41.716
the department
will not provide you
with counsel.

07:41.919 --> 07:44.194
You'll be forced
to foot the legal bills
on your own.

07:44.399 --> 07:47.038
You're ineligible for
a police pension, and you'll
be out of a job shortly.

07:47.239 --> 07:49.434
So you'll have to liquidate
your assets to fight this.

07:49.639 --> 07:51.869
Look who's making threats now.

07:52.719 --> 07:55.313
I'm just giving you a preview
of the next seven years

07:55.519 --> 07:57.430
of legal hell you're in for,
detective.

07:58.359 --> 07:59.951
Have a nice night.

08:06.679 --> 08:08.078
You know?

08:09.599 --> 08:12.955
I need a minute.
I'll get us another drink.

08:17.919 --> 08:20.194
You branching out to the Orient?

08:20.399 --> 08:22.993
I didn't expect
to see you so soon.

08:23.559 --> 08:26.756
I need every copy of
that picture, and I need
the story that goes along with it.

08:27.239 --> 08:30.515
May be impossible.
Well, then, so's our arrangement.

08:30.879 --> 08:32.631
I guess I gotta go back
to turning over those rocks

08:32.839 --> 08:34.635
on the San Marcos murders.

08:34.839 --> 08:38.514
My connection is only tertiary.
Certainly nothing criminal.

08:38.719 --> 08:40.755
Then why are you afraid
of what I might find?

08:40.958 --> 08:43.313
Afraid? No.

08:43.519 --> 08:47.148
I have larger interests
I'd like to protect.

08:47.519 --> 08:49.157
Things too big for me
to follow?

08:50.759 --> 08:53.956
I understand you're
a very effective officer
on a street level.

08:54.559 --> 08:56.868
I've made some arrests.
I hope many more.

08:57.799 --> 09:02.554
But understand, you are
nothing more than a fly
on one of my many shits.

09:03.839 --> 09:05.511
I'm offering you an opportunity

09:05.719 --> 09:08.870
not because I fear you,
but to save myself the trouble

09:09.079 --> 09:12.913
of having to take more drastic
measures in the future.

09:21.599 --> 09:23.635
I'm sorry if I offended you.

09:23.839 --> 09:26.399
I may have future jobs for you.

09:26.599 --> 09:29.113
Ways you can help me.
Good.

09:29.319 --> 09:33.676
Have you talked with our friend?
Have you saved your job?

09:33.879 --> 09:37.394
Look, pictures can be copied.
Manufactured.

09:37.599 --> 09:42.070
I need the original, all the copies,
and the story that goes with it.

09:42.399 --> 09:45.948
You understand I have
to sell him
an end to this,

09:46.159 --> 09:50.072
otherwise I won't have
a badge to do
those jobs for you.

09:52.919 --> 09:55.911
You'll find I'm a very good man
to work under.

10:01.999 --> 10:05.196
SHANE:
It's an unfortunate series of events
down at the docks.

10:05.399 --> 10:07.469
Orange isn't your colour.

10:07.999 --> 10:10.991
What if I told you I was
willing to help steer you
clear of these troubles?

10:11.199 --> 10:13.269
Trusting you is what landed me
in this shithole.

10:13.479 --> 10:15.674
Importing untaxed gas
landed you here.

10:16.759 --> 10:17.714
You, uh...

10:19.919 --> 10:21.875
recognise your business ledgers?

10:24.119 --> 10:26.189
They disappear
from our evidence locker,

10:26.399 --> 10:28.594
DA'll be forced to cut a deal.

10:28.799 --> 10:30.357
That means months
instead of years.

10:32.399 --> 10:35.197
I made a bad judgement call
pairing up with
Kesakhian's daughter.

10:36.199 --> 10:38.474
She's got some bad intel
about a couple of innocents

10:38.679 --> 10:40.590
she thinks robbed
that Armenian money train

10:40.799 --> 10:43.154
and I gotta stop the bloodshed.

10:43.359 --> 10:46.988
So I just need to know who the bosses
in the homeland will send
to do the job, and when.

10:47.199 --> 10:51.397
You backed a woman in this fight.
You want these books lost or not?

10:53.399 --> 10:55.629
Is it true her father's near death?

10:59.839 --> 11:04.151
If Diro's smart,
and she is, she'll handle
the retaliation herself.

11:04.359 --> 11:08.147
Hire locally. When it's done,
she'll make the call.

11:08.359 --> 11:11.476
Tell our friends
back home that she found
the problem, solved it.

11:11.999 --> 11:14.149
Who will she use
to do the whack?

11:14.359 --> 11:17.351
Somebody that's been
extremely loyal to her father.

11:17.559 --> 11:20.027
Zadofian would be
her choice.

11:20.599 --> 11:25.468
Where can I find him?
No idea, but betrayal like this?

11:25.679 --> 11:27.909
Your friends won't be first.

11:28.119 --> 11:32.192
First she'll kill their children.
The wives.

11:32.479 --> 11:35.312
When the pain of that suffering
begins to fade,

11:35.679 --> 11:38.068
she'll kill the men involved.

11:40.679 --> 11:41.998
[###]

11:52.199 --> 11:55.908
I got three DMV listings on Zadofian
in L.A. county.

11:56.119 --> 11:59.156
Yeah, looks like
a father and daughter
in Whittier,

11:59.359 --> 12:01.429
<i>and a 45-year-old male</i>
<i>in Glendale.</i>

12:01.639 --> 12:04.153
All right, give me Glendale's licence
and registration.

12:04.359 --> 12:07.954
Okay. Ari Zadofian.
'03 Lexus. Black.

12:08.159 --> 12:11.151
Registered to a P.O. box.
Stake and notify on the Lexus.

12:11.359 --> 12:14.112
It's urgent, so I want you
to pass it along
to Wilshire and Pasadena.

12:14.319 --> 12:15.354
<i>Sure thing.</i>

12:18.679 --> 12:20.749
VIC:
I was buying your denial
about the photo,

12:20.959 --> 12:24.713
but that Doberman you sent
gave away your hand.

12:26.159 --> 12:29.515
What now, huh? Pictures of me
screwing the Bush twins?

12:29.719 --> 12:31.198
No.

12:31.799 --> 12:34.996
The original memory stick that Juan
downloaded the picture onto,

12:35.199 --> 12:37.110
and every existing copy.

12:37.319 --> 12:40.675

winds up in his hands,

13:20.839 --> 13:23.148
why Mexican and American
government officials

13:23.359 --> 13:25.315
tried to stop
the San Marcos investigation.

That is the nephew
Miracle Joe was always
talking about seeing someday.

27:55.199 --> 27:56.917
I found it in his wallet.

27:57.119 --> 27:59.269
I'll run his name through

you had a thing for her.

No. Not really, I just...
I don't know,

to myself I could still get my girl on.

he never had a chance.

He had a chance.
He just never took it.

Kevin was an impulse thing,

29:35.039 --> 29:37.872

he's avoiding me,
it was a big mistake.

the doctors told him
that he only had a year to live.

living on the street.

to bring him home,
but he didn't want that.
