Ben:
Welcome, everyone,
to the Jewel-bilee.

00:15.382 --> 00:18.050
I'm so glad Mal was able
to spell us back to normal.

00:18.085 --> 00:20.252
Yeah, but then why
are you still so small?

00:21.288 --> 00:22.687
It is my great honor

00:22.722 --> 00:25.224
to give each of you, your jewel.

00:27.394 --> 00:28.693

Evie...

00:40.474 --> 00:42.941
It totally matches my dress!

00:42.976 --> 00:46.044
And last, but
most definitely not least...

00:46.079 --> 00:47.879
Mal.

00:47.914 --> 00:49.448
At last.

00:49.483 --> 00:50.849
