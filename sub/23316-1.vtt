00:19.080 --> 00:21.760
[ARABIC]
[People, help me, please!]

00:21.840 --> 00:24.600
[Somebody help me, please!]

00:26.760 --> 00:29.000
[-People, help me, please!]
[-What's going on?]

00:32.040 --> 00:33.400
[Bring some water.]

00:35.800 --> 00:37.680
[Bring him over.]

00:37.760 --> 00:39.760
[-Bring him over.]
[-I don't know what happened.]

00:39.840 --> 00:42.520
[Lay him down.
Get an ambulance. Let me see.]

00:43.160 --> 00:44.400
[Give him some water.]

00:45.480 --> 00:46.840
[Some water, quick!]

00:48.480 --> 00:50.080
[-What happened to him?]
-[Move over.]

00:50.640 --> 00:52.840
[-I was hurt.]
[-What is it? Let me see.]

00:58.240 --> 01:01.000
[Anybody who moves gets
a bullet in the head! Back off!]

01:03.320 --> 01:04.760
[Back off!]

01:24.080 --> 01:25.600
-Is everyone alright?
-Yes.

01:25.680 --> 01:27.480
[-What did I do?]
[-Quiet!]

01:27.560 --> 01:29.520
[-Quiet!]
[-Quiet.]

02:07.080 --> 02:09.840
[You wanted to smuggle in
nerve gas through Aqaba]

02:09.920 --> 02:12.280
[and explosives through Syria.]

02:12.600 --> 02:15.800
[I see you know everything.
So what do you want from me?]

02:16.160 --> 02:19.720
[Someone's fixing us a big "shabang"
and we don't know who.]

02:20.040 --> 02:21.400
[Neither do I.]

02:23.560 --> 02:28.800
[Listen, I know you're worried too,
not just me.]

02:35.240 --> 02:36.400
[Want one?]

02:38.800 --> 02:39.960
[I don't smoke.]

02:41.040 --> 02:42.240
[Why not?]

02:44.800 --> 02:46.040
[Look,]

02:46.760 --> 02:48.760
[with the treatment
she's getting,]

02:49.240 --> 02:53.920
[Nadia could live for two years
maximum in total misery and then--]

02:55.080 --> 02:57.560
[In our society,
someone of your status]

02:57.680 --> 03:00.840
[would've gotten his daughter a kidney
transplant in Hadassah long ago,]

03:00.920 --> 03:04.640
[but in your society, the Authority
gives preference to its people]

03:04.720 --> 03:07.400
[and your children are at the
bottom of the priority list.]

03:09.480 --> 03:11.680
[You could save her life,]

03:12.200 --> 03:14.440
[your daughter could live well
like her friends do,]

03:14.560 --> 03:16.480
[like she deserves.]

03:16.640 --> 03:18.640
[I'm doing everything
in my power.]

03:23.920 --> 03:27.840
[Ali, I've got five children,
may God keep them safe.]

03:28.040 --> 03:31.560
[I promise you that if one of them
were in Nadia's condition,]

03:32.200 --> 03:34.360
[I'd jump through hoops for him.]

03:34.600 --> 03:37.200
[Nothing would stop me.]

03:41.280 --> 03:43.600
[Ali, who's behind
the nerve gas story in Aqaba?]

03:46.800 --> 03:49.760
[I'd kill everyone on this earth
for my daughter.]

03:50.680 --> 03:54.120
[I'd give up my life for her,
no questions asked.]

03:54.680 --> 04:01.680
[You, sir, all you need to do is
give me one name.]

04:02.160 --> 04:05.120
[One name, Ali.
And we'll take care of your kid.]

04:13.320 --> 04:16.480
[-Abu Ahmad.]
[-Who?]

04:17.480 --> 04:19.480
[Abu Ahmad. Taufiq Hammed.]

04:25.080 --> 04:26.680
[You're making fun of me.]

04:27.880 --> 04:29.680
[This won't end well.]

04:30.160 --> 04:32.000
[I swear to you.]

04:33.120 --> 04:38.280
[-The Panther.]
[-The Panther is dead. We killed him.]

04:46.760 --> 04:49.000
-Stop!
-You had it coming!

04:49.400 --> 04:50.400
Stop!

04:54.560 --> 04:56.920
Let's see what you've got.

05:24.200 --> 05:26.120
You can feel the astringency.

05:27.200 --> 05:30.760
-Is that merlot?
-It's not ready yet, Moreno.

05:32.520 --> 05:34.120
Why are you here?

05:42.680 --> 05:44.120
Abu Ahmad is alive.

05:45.360 --> 05:49.600
-Which Abu Ahmad?
-Your Panther.

05:52.760 --> 05:55.760
-Impossible. I killed him.
-Sadly, it is possible.

05:56.160 --> 05:58.640
But don't sweat it,
he won't be alive much longer.

05:58.720 --> 06:01.040
We're finishing him tomorrow
at his brother's wedding.

06:01.120 --> 06:04.920
We got a heads-up he'll be there.
Most likely.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.080
But I killed him, Moreno,
what's going on?

06:07.160 --> 06:09.680
That's why I wanted you
to hear about it from me.

06:12.480 --> 06:17.160
-But there was a funeral for him.
-Yes, there was.

06:22.680 --> 06:26.680
I'm just not sure the team will get
a definite visual of him on field,

06:27.160 --> 06:30.400
so I could use someone
who's already killed him before.

06:33.640 --> 06:37.320
Look, if you feel unready to be
on field, stay in the command post.

06:37.760 --> 06:39.320
We'll equip the team with cams,

06:39.400 --> 06:41.480
you'll identify the bastard
and they'll finish him.

06:41.560 --> 06:44.640
You'll get to cheer them
and eat all their pastries.

06:46.440 --> 06:48.360
It's only for two hours.

06:50.680 --> 06:54.440
What do you say?
Two hours. It'll be quite a show.

06:57.360 --> 06:59.720
No, no, no. No way.

07:01.800 --> 07:05.560
Too bad. I thought
you'd jump at the opportunity.

07:05.800 --> 07:07.040
Opportunity?

07:07.440 --> 07:09.560
To settle the score.

07:09.680 --> 07:12.320
I've settled my score with the
Panther a long time ago.

07:12.400 --> 07:13.920
I have a new life,
I'm happy.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.440
I meant, settle the score
with yourself.

07:48.480 --> 07:55.000
SILWAD VILLAGE
NORTH OF RAMALLAH

08:06.000 --> 08:08.440
[-Congrats, groom.]
[-Thanks, take care.]

08:12.760 --> 08:14.920
[-Shut up and you'll be fine.]
[-Let me go!]

08:15.000 --> 08:17.040
[-I'm getting married tomorrow!]
[-Get in!]

08:21.520 --> 08:22.920
[Let me out!]

08:33.760 --> 08:36.040
[Please, help me,
I have to get out of here.]

08:39.600 --> 08:40.920
[I didn't do anything.]

08:52.600 --> 08:53.600
[Taufiq?]

08:53.680 --> 08:56.680
[Wow, it's been 18 months
since someone called me Taufiq.]

09:02.840 --> 09:04.360
[I've missed you guys.]

09:05.960 --> 09:07.400
[I've missed you.]

09:12.840 --> 09:16.640
[I can't believe my little brother
Bashir is getting married.]

09:17.560 --> 09:19.000
[Stop crying.]

09:19.080 --> 09:21.080
[Stop, or your eyes
will swell up.]

09:23.200 --> 09:25.280
[Will you be at the wedding?]

09:26.320 --> 09:30.120
[I'm a Shahid (martyr).
Shahids don't go to weddings.]

09:30.200 --> 09:31.960
[But the Jews have stopped
looking for you.]

09:32.040 --> 09:35.200
[Right, and I don't want them
to start all over again.]

09:36.720 --> 09:40.560
[Take this, Brother.
It's a gift for you and Amal.]

09:41.400 --> 09:42.600
[I couldn't.]

09:42.680 --> 09:46.080
[Take it, don't let me down.]

09:48.120 --> 09:49.520
[Groom.]

09:51.840 --> 09:56.000
[Taufiq, you must see Amal,
she's so pretty.]

11:36.480 --> 11:37.480
Dad?

12:00.120 --> 12:01.600
What's up, sweetie?

12:03.280 --> 12:05.880
What are you doing?
Give me the keys.

12:07.160 --> 12:11.640
-Where are you headed? To Moreno?
-Yes. Give me the keys.

12:11.720 --> 12:14.320
-Why get into this again?
-I'm not, don't worry.

12:14.400 --> 12:15.760
So then why are you going?

12:15.840 --> 12:17.920
To take care
of something and come back.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.760
-Give me the keys.
-Let someone else take care of it.

12:20.960 --> 12:22.320
Come on, give me the keys!

12:22.400 --> 12:24.280
How could you do this
without telling me?

12:24.360 --> 12:26.920
Is this because I'm doing it
or because I didn't tell you?

12:27.000 --> 12:29.240
You need to discuss
things like that with me!

12:29.320 --> 12:31.040
-What's there to discuss?
-A lot!

12:31.120 --> 12:32.840
We have two kids at home
who need you.

12:32.920 --> 12:35.440
-Gali, give me the keys.
-No way.

12:35.520 --> 12:36.520
Give me the keys!

12:36.600 --> 12:38.800
Talk to me for five minutes,
and I will.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.440
For fuck's sake!

12:45.600 --> 12:46.840
Doron!

13:23.760 --> 13:25.480
Team 8200 will handle
the antenna

13:25.560 --> 13:27.960
that'll pick up the signal
400 meters from the house.

13:28.040 --> 13:30.040
The problem is
access to the house.

13:30.120 --> 13:33.560
We can't physically block the area
and risk exposing our team.

13:34.120 --> 13:35.120
I was thinking--

13:35.200 --> 13:37.600
[-Good morning.]
[-Good morning.]

13:37.680 --> 13:39.640
[-Hey, handsome!]
[-My dear.]

13:41.280 --> 13:43.080
[-How are you?]
[-Fine.]

13:44.120 --> 13:47.800
[Our main man,
so good to see you.]

13:50.280 --> 13:52.000
[-How are you, buddy?]
[-What's up?]

13:52.080 --> 13:55.280
[-I'm fine, and you?]
[-Alive and well.]

13:57.120 --> 14:00.000
Doron will remain in the command post
during the operation.

14:02.480 --> 14:05.760
Moreno, I decided
to join the team on the field.

14:07.240 --> 14:10.080
Anything you care
to share with me?

14:11.400 --> 14:12.520
Didn't you tell him?

14:12.600 --> 14:15.480
You said you wanted
to squash grapes.

14:15.880 --> 14:18.120
Doron will help us
identify Abu Ahmad.

14:18.200 --> 14:19.840
He's the only one
who saw him alive.

14:19.920 --> 14:23.360
Bro, it's your call.
I don't want to interfere, okay?

14:23.600 --> 14:27.000
If you want me in the command post,
I'll stay there. It's your call.

14:29.440 --> 14:33.000
-Look who's here.
-Bro! Move over.

14:35.200 --> 14:37.960
-What's up?
-Get a load of this hunk.

14:39.720 --> 14:41.400
Give us a hug, man.

14:42.480 --> 14:45.680
Bashir Hammed, the Panther's younger
brother, is getting married today,

14:45.760 --> 14:48.920
and we'll be there too.
Abu Ahmad might show up.

14:50.520 --> 14:52.640
According to Intelligence,
he's still alive.

14:54.440 --> 14:57.040
How? Didn't Doron kill him
18 months ago?

14:57.160 --> 14:59.960
-Apparently, he didn't.
-Ali Karmi claims he's still around

15:00.040 --> 15:02.520
and we must
at least check it out.

15:02.600 --> 15:05.600
But Moreno, he hasn't been on
the field in 18 months. No offence.

15:05.680 --> 15:07.680
-What's with you?
-What's the matter?

15:07.760 --> 15:10.720
Hey, this isn't open for debate.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.480
Eli will go over the plan
with you and...

15:14.440 --> 15:16.000
you'll be nice.

15:18.360 --> 15:20.800
I don't get it,
we're going to kill a dead person?

15:22.040 --> 15:24.840
Everyone,
study the route carefully,

15:24.920 --> 15:27.040
especially this emergency
rescue spot.

15:27.400 --> 15:29.560
And this spot
is the helicopter meeting point.

15:29.640 --> 15:30.840
Steve, you lead the way.

15:30.920 --> 15:33.280
Avihai,
according to aerial photographs,

15:33.360 --> 15:35.000
you have a 50 meter clearance

15:35.080 --> 15:37.520
to reach the house
and the street.

15:37.600 --> 15:43.160
Naor comes in as a guest.
Doron and I enter with the pastries.

15:43.600 --> 15:48.320
-Boaz, you'll be at the observation
post. -No way. I'm going in.

15:48.400 --> 15:50.960
Look, we can't both
enter the house.

15:51.040 --> 15:54.080
-It's not fair towards Gali.
-What's she got to do with it?

15:54.160 --> 15:57.080
She's my wife and your sister,
that's what.

15:57.960 --> 15:59.400
Eli and I decided
you'll block the street.

15:59.480 --> 16:02.240
-Eli, come on!
-It's not up for discussion.

16:02.320 --> 16:04.320
Boaz, are you a child?

16:04.600 --> 16:06.600
It's a big operation, with many
people, entrances and exits.

16:06.680 --> 16:09.360
I need someone outside.
Should that be me?

16:10.200 --> 16:13.440
Field radios open, no talking
unless we're exposed.

16:14.360 --> 16:16.360
Remember who we're dealing with.

16:19.200 --> 16:21.680
Abu Ahmad killed 116 Israelis

16:21.760 --> 16:24.440
in suicide bombings
that he himself carried out.

16:24.520 --> 16:26.160
116 Israelis.

16:27.600 --> 16:31.480
He's killed more than
any other terrorist.

16:33.400 --> 16:34.720
Women,

16:35.120 --> 16:36.440
children,

16:36.760 --> 16:38.160
elderly,

16:38.640 --> 16:40.000
and soldiers.

16:40.480 --> 16:44.080
The bastard is a murderer
and a dead man.

16:44.480 --> 16:46.040
He's a dead man!

16:48.120 --> 16:50.360
Today we're settling
the score with him.

16:57.200 --> 16:58.600
Good luck.

17:17.400 --> 17:19.720
[Make it shorter
so it doesn't drag along the floor.]

17:23.360 --> 17:26.320
[Hold on, I'll be right back.]

17:30.600 --> 17:33.400
[What are you doing here?
Did anyone see you come in?]

17:33.480 --> 17:36.680
[Of course not. They're all busy
getting groomed and pretty.]

17:37.080 --> 17:39.440
[I can't wait for this mess
to be over!]

17:41.040 --> 17:43.000
[Now it's just you and me here.]

17:43.080 --> 17:45.640
[You're crazy,
wait for tonight.]

17:48.040 --> 17:49.520
[You're a better person
than me.]

17:49.680 --> 17:51.560
[Of course,
a million times better.]

17:55.160 --> 17:56.440
[What's this?]

17:56.840 --> 17:59.360
[-A wedding present.]
[-From whom?]

18:02.320 --> 18:06.480
[Bashir, I don't take money
without knowing whom it's from.]

18:07.000 --> 18:10.120
[I know whom it's from.
Don't you trust me?]

18:10.760 --> 18:13.920
[We'll build a house with this money
and raise lots of kids.]

18:19.520 --> 18:20.920
[No, no, no.]

18:21.440 --> 18:23.920
[Wait for tonight, crazy girl.]

19:40.160 --> 19:42.200
-Get out of the car.
-Why?

19:42.280 --> 19:43.960
Just get out.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.280
Soldier, bro,
I have to get to a wedding.

19:47.360 --> 19:50.000
You're backing up traffic.
Move it.

19:51.520 --> 19:52.360
-Move.
-Come on,

19:52.440 --> 19:54.440
you can see the car
is full of wedding pastries.

19:54.520 --> 19:57.320
Come on.
Get in the jeep.

20:10.280 --> 20:13.480
[-Peace be upon you.]
[-Peace be upon you.]

20:14.320 --> 20:15.840
[Congratulations, groom.]

20:17.480 --> 20:19.840
[-Congratulations.]
[-Thanks.]

21:42.400 --> 21:45.520
DAUD'S KNAFEH PASTRIES

22:02.040 --> 22:06.080
[Welcome, dear guests.]

22:06.360 --> 22:10.760
[We're here on this joyous occasion
that celebrates happiness and love,]

22:11.680 --> 22:16.560
[but I'd like to just mention
my younger brother,]

22:16.720 --> 22:20.520
[Abu Taufiq, may he rest in peace,
Bashir's father,]

22:20.720 --> 22:23.160
[and Abu Ahmad,
Taufiq Mustafa Hammed,]

22:23.400 --> 22:27.480
[the brave Panther and
Shahid (martyr), Bashir's brother,]

22:27.640 --> 22:29.720
[who I wish
was with us today.]

22:30.680 --> 22:36.520
[With us, however, is Nassrin,
Abu Ahmad's brave wife.]

22:37.480 --> 22:39.360
[Let us say the "Fatiha"
to pray for their souls.]

22:39.440 --> 22:40.440
["Fatiha".]

22:51.200 --> 22:53.600
[-May God have mercy on us all.]
[-May God have mercy on us all.]

22:56.160 --> 23:00.160
[When I see you, Bashir,
and you, Amal,]

23:00.520 --> 23:04.480
[I say to myself,
this is the best revenge.]

23:05.400 --> 23:07.920
[Despite all that the occupation
has done to us,]

23:08.160 --> 23:11.080
[we still bear children.]

23:11.160 --> 23:15.680
[We're successful, we raise families,
have children and prosper.]

23:19.400 --> 23:22.040
[-Here you go, Abu Khalil.]
[-Thank you.]

23:22.120 --> 23:24.080
[May God have mercy on us all.]

23:24.200 --> 23:28.880
[We'd like to thank brother Abu Khalil
for coming specially from Amman.]

23:28.960 --> 23:31.080
[And now, dear guests,
it's time to celebrate.]

23:31.160 --> 23:32.880
[May God bring joy to you all.]

23:32.960 --> 23:34.720
[Let's sing and dance.]

24:02.200 --> 24:05.640
So, how's civilian life?
How are the olives?

24:05.720 --> 24:08.840
No, no olives.
I grow grapes. I make wine.

24:10.360 --> 24:13.080
Like merlot, Bordeaux?
That stuff?

24:13.800 --> 24:16.640
Bordeaux is a place, bro.
Not a grape.

24:16.840 --> 24:19.040
You've really cleaned up, ah?

24:20.320 --> 24:23.480
So, how's Gali doing?

24:24.240 --> 24:27.040
Boaz said she's thrilled
to have you home again.

24:28.200 --> 24:30.520
Yeah, we're happy,
you know.

24:31.760 --> 24:33.320
I don't know, bro.

24:35.760 --> 24:38.120
-Samir.
-Copy.

24:38.560 --> 24:42.160
Your boss at the bakery just
got a call, someone saw the arrest.

24:42.320 --> 24:45.720
-Does the mother know about it?
-Not as far as we know.

24:45.800 --> 24:47.400
Should we go back, Eli?

24:49.040 --> 24:50.560
You want to go back?

24:50.640 --> 24:52.760
I don't know,
are they on to us or not?

24:53.000 --> 24:55.960
-Moreno, are they on to us or not?
-No, nobody's on to you.

24:56.040 --> 24:57.960
Relax, I was just filling you in.

24:59.760 --> 25:01.600
Chill out, it'll be alright.

25:03.080 --> 25:05.080
Those two are like the old guys
from "The Puppets".

25:05.160 --> 25:06.760
"The Muppets".

25:06.840 --> 25:10.240
How do you know that show?
It was aired before you were born.

25:10.640 --> 25:14.640
-You know I know everything.
-May God help me.

25:30.360 --> 25:32.400
[Do you think
he'll show up?]

25:34.080 --> 25:36.440
[I don't know.
You know I'm against it.]

25:36.520 --> 25:38.120
[Why should he show up now?]

25:38.800 --> 25:42.600
[He wants to see you,
don't you realize that?]

25:42.680 --> 25:46.960
[But why now of all times?
Just to put himself in danger?]

25:47.400 --> 25:51.120
[Now's not the time to discuss this.
It's Bashir's wedding. Let's go.]

26:58.400 --> 27:01.080
[-Peace be upon you.]
[-Upon you be peace.]

27:01.920 --> 27:04.680
[-Are you from
"Daud's Knafeh Pastries"? -Yes.]

27:04.760 --> 27:07.800
[I'm Samir and this is Najib.
We'll take care of your wedding.]

27:07.880 --> 27:09.240
[God willing, I hope so.]

27:09.320 --> 27:13.960
[-What took you so long?]
[-We got held up a bit at the checkpoint.]

27:14.160 --> 27:16.120
[Good thing you're here,]

27:16.200 --> 27:20.480
[because leaving the Hammed family
with no sweets is a crime.]

27:20.560 --> 27:23.320
[Go on, start serving.
Lower the flame.]

29:22.840 --> 29:26.120
[-He's in the area, he should be here.]
[-How do you know?]

29:26.920 --> 29:28.320
[His wife told me.]

30:05.720 --> 30:07.520
Getting married, ah? Idiots.

30:07.920 --> 30:11.040
-How's your ex-wife?
-Which one?

30:12.840 --> 30:16.440
Moreno, get married already, so you
can get divorced and live it up.

30:17.600 --> 30:20.560
What's up, Chuck Nurit?
Wanna marry me?

30:40.760 --> 30:42.680
I don't believe it.
It's Amjad Abu Khalef.

30:42.760 --> 30:44.920
We've been on his tail for two years!
-Not now.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.840
-Hell yeah. Tell them to get him.
-Forget Abu Khalef now.

30:58.680 --> 31:00.920
[Don't worry.]

31:01.000 --> 31:02.280
[Thank you very much.]

31:03.400 --> 31:05.600
[-What is it?]
[-The guy from "Daud's Knafeh Pastries".]

31:05.680 --> 31:09.520
[He called to apologize that his guys
are held up at the checkpoint.]

31:09.600 --> 31:12.040
[What? But they're here.]

31:15.200 --> 31:18.280
[Tell them to call him
and calm him down. Call him.]

31:19.520 --> 31:20.920
[They suspect us.]

31:30.000 --> 31:31.400
[We have a problem.]

31:32.640 --> 31:34.080
[What is it?]

31:34.240 --> 31:35.880
[They're looking at us.]

31:39.480 --> 31:41.440
[They must be on to us.
Let's go.]

31:41.520 --> 31:44.240
[-Give me a minute.]
[-No, we have to go now!]

32:07.600 --> 32:12.040
[Guys, please help us
move a table outside.]

32:12.280 --> 32:15.240
[Sorry, we're in a big rush,
we have another event to get to.]

32:15.320 --> 32:18.600
[You arrived late and now you won't
help? Don't make the guests work.]

32:18.680 --> 32:21.920
[-Sorry, we're in a rush.]
[-Just five minutes.]

32:22.000 --> 32:23.320
[Come with us.]

32:23.400 --> 32:25.080
[Just five minutes. Come.]

32:25.640 --> 32:27.320
[Please.]

32:47.240 --> 32:48.720
[-Not a word.]
[-What did we do?]

32:48.800 --> 32:51.120
[Not a word!
Answer only when spoken to.]

32:51.720 --> 32:53.640
[We spoke to your boss.]

32:53.720 --> 32:56.040
[We asked
where his workers are,]

32:56.120 --> 32:58.120
[the ones who got held up
at the checkpoint.]

32:58.200 --> 33:00.840
[-And?]
[-He said he sent two workers,]

33:00.920 --> 33:04.200
[one with green eyes
and black hair with gel,]

33:04.280 --> 33:06.280
[and the other is dark and fat.]

33:06.840 --> 33:11.360
[We changed the staff last minute.
Abu Eyad wasn't at the bakery then.]

33:11.440 --> 33:12.920
[I'm not buying this bullshit.]

33:13.000 --> 33:16.680
[Sir, I'm really sorry
about the misunderstanding.]

33:16.840 --> 33:19.320
[Please call him again.]

33:19.400 --> 33:22.320
[Tell him they sent
Samir and Najib over instead.]

33:22.640 --> 33:23.680
[Call him.]

33:25.720 --> 33:27.520
Turn off their cellular reception.

33:29.080 --> 33:32.080
No calls can get through beyond
a 200-meter radius of the house.

33:39.560 --> 33:40.360
[It's busy.]

33:40.440 --> 33:41.720
[-Sir--]
[-Step back!]

33:41.800 --> 33:42.800
[You want to kill me?]

33:43.600 --> 33:47.520
[I have a family to provide for.
The checkpoint held us back.]

33:47.600 --> 33:49.480
[We have another wedding
to get to.]

33:49.680 --> 33:52.920
[-I beg you, talk to him.]
[-Dial.]

34:00.240 --> 34:01.400
[Still busy.]

34:04.400 --> 34:08.840
[Sir, I'd hate to keep
the other family waiting.]

34:09.280 --> 34:15.720
[If our boss hears we got there late
and that we upset you as well--]

34:19.360 --> 34:21.880
[-Alright.]
[-Alright?]

34:22.600 --> 34:24.240
[-Thank you.]
[-Thank you.]

34:24.840 --> 34:26.720
[-Thank you.]
[-Thank you.]

34:34.960 --> 34:37.080
[Why?]

34:37.280 --> 34:39.240
[Fauda, fauda (Chaos)!]

34:39.320 --> 34:41.760
[Steve, get to the meeting point!]

35:15.640 --> 35:17.120
[Move back!]

35:20.600 --> 35:22.040
[Move back!]

35:25.160 --> 35:26.160
[Bashir!]

35:31.160 --> 35:32.160
[Bashir!]

35:32.560 --> 35:33.600
[Amal!]

35:38.400 --> 35:40.720
[Bashir! Bashir!]

35:50.160 --> 35:51.160
[Bashir!]

36:00.520 --> 36:02.000
[Bashir!]

36:12.480 --> 36:14.520
[Get out of here!]

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
[Let me through!
Let me through!]

36:33.760 --> 36:36.000
-What's going on?
-He fucked up my leg!

36:36.200 --> 36:39.080
-Drive, drive!
-God damn it!

36:40.360 --> 36:41.800
[Stay with me.]

36:43.520 --> 36:45.320
That's Abu Ahmad!
Stop the car!

36:46.000 --> 36:47.240
I told you to stop!

36:48.160 --> 36:50.320
Get in the car, Doron!
That's an order!

36:54.200 --> 36:56.120
Reporting, abort! Abort!

36:56.280 --> 36:57.600
Drive! Drive!

36:59.760 --> 37:02.240
-I can't go through here!
-Follow him!

37:09.160 --> 37:12.400
-They're in for one hell of a fauda.
-Those damn bastards.

37:12.920 --> 37:14.680
Calm down.

37:14.760 --> 37:17.960
-Avihai, contact Moreno.
-Okay, okay.

37:19.160 --> 37:22.040
Moreno, do you copy?
Doron escaped, chasing some old guy.

37:22.120 --> 37:23.480
He's sure it's Abu Ahmad.

37:23.560 --> 37:26.080
The entire village is on your tail.
Get out now!

37:26.160 --> 37:27.880
-Where's Doron?
-I don't know, Moreno.

37:27.960 --> 37:30.800
Nurit,
send a chopper in right now.

37:32.840 --> 37:34.320
Now, now, now!

37:34.400 --> 37:37.120
-It'll be okay, relax.
-Why did he leave the vehicle?

37:37.200 --> 37:39.120
-Why did he get out?
-He saw Abu Ahmad.

37:39.200 --> 37:42.040
-He thinks he saw Abu Ahmad.
-I'm not ditching him, Eli!

37:48.800 --> 37:51.160
Get in, get in!

38:24.360 --> 38:26.560
They're headed west,
two alleys north of you.

38:27.160 --> 38:29.360
-There he is, can't you see?
-Drive.

38:58.440 --> 39:00.600
What's this here?
Turn on the flashlight.

39:04.880 --> 39:07.280
Moreno, what's going on?
Do you see Doron?

39:08.520 --> 39:11.040
You're inches away from him,
I repeat, inches away.

39:11.120 --> 39:14.480
There are three men running east,
200 meters ahead of you.

39:21.920 --> 39:23.720
There!

39:25.160 --> 39:27.000
Guys, get ready for action.

40:15.400 --> 40:17.360
[He's here, he's here.]

40:18.480 --> 40:20.400
[He's here, I just know he is.]

40:20.480 --> 40:22.520
[-Come on.]
[-He's here.]

40:22.600 --> 40:24.240
[Enough, come on.]
