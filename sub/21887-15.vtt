00:00.063 --> 00:02.000
<i>Previously on "Gotham"...</i>

00:06.670 --> 00:08.331
I'm arresting you

00:08.364 --> 00:09.803
for the murder of the boy you blew up

00:09.827 --> 00:11.215
under the Crown Point Bridge.

00:11.277 --> 00:13.983
You blew that kid sky-high.

00:14.030 --> 00:15.030
You are lying.

00:15.087 --> 00:17.387
You are a lying traitor.

00:19.692 --> 00:21.992
I need you at the head of the GCPD.

00:22.094 --> 00:24.495
Let them think you're a hero.

00:24.597 --> 00:26.029
I screwed up, Harv.

00:26.132 --> 00:28.098
Sofia hired the Pyg,

00:28.200 --> 00:29.466
and I covered it up.

00:30.870 --> 00:33.403
We all have to make sacrifices.

00:33.506 --> 00:34.649
Thought it was all about family.

00:34.673 --> 00:36.340
Never said it was a happy family.

00:39.278 --> 00:40.711
My friend thinks

00:40.813 --> 00:41.912
we're here to rob you.

00:42.014 --> 00:43.213
But I know

00:43.315 --> 00:44.515
you torture plants

00:44.617 --> 00:47.985
in the name of science, Roland Charles.

00:51.991 --> 00:54.391
Lee Thompkins may have made Ed strong,

00:54.493 --> 00:56.560
but I see the other you...

00:56.662 --> 00:57.895
the Riddler.

00:57.997 --> 00:59.563
I'm back.

03:07.359 --> 03:09.293
Uncle Penguin sent me to get you.

03:11.630 --> 03:14.164
Come on, let's get ice cream.

03:25.646 --> 03:28.879
The Narrows is under new management.

03:30.816 --> 03:33.116
The Narrows is Sampson's turf.

03:34.119 --> 03:35.452
And Sampson...

03:35.554 --> 03:38.388
well, collects protection.

03:39.491 --> 03:41.058
And people need to find out

03:41.160 --> 03:44.461
what happens when you don't pay.

03:50.402 --> 03:53.737
Please, my family.

03:53.839 --> 03:57.107
Do I look like an animal to you?

03:57.209 --> 03:59.909
I wouldn't hurt your family.

04:03.235 --> 04:06.015
Unless they don't pay me.

04:14.059 --> 04:16.059
Before Don Falcone died,

04:16.161 --> 04:18.394
he warned me I had no idea

04:18.497 --> 04:19.930
what I brought to the city.

04:20.031 --> 04:23.233
I now know he was talking about the Pyg.

04:23.335 --> 04:25.235
Somebody must have told him.

04:25.337 --> 04:28.238
My guess, that person has evidence

04:28.340 --> 04:30.173
that links Sofia to the Pyg's murders.

04:30.275 --> 04:32.609
Why not come forward with what you know?

04:32.711 --> 04:35.072
It has to be more
than just my word against hers.

04:35.119 --> 04:37.781
Or are you afraid the truth
is gonna drag you down, too?

04:37.883 --> 04:39.950
Harvey, we've been over this.

04:40.052 --> 04:42.185
- When did you know?
- I swear,

04:42.287 --> 04:45.288
I had no idea
until after it was too late.

04:45.391 --> 04:46.623
And you can be pissed,

04:46.725 --> 04:48.759
but this is bigger than both of us.

04:55.701 --> 04:57.934
I need to know I can count on you.

05:01.306 --> 05:02.672
Yeah, Jim.

05:04.943 --> 05:07.110
I'll help you take down Sofia.

05:08.914 --> 05:11.448
But then you're gonna have
to pay for what you done.

05:11.550 --> 05:13.383
I personally guarantee it.

05:14.044 --> 05:16.693
I know an ex-Falcone assassin.

05:16.778 --> 05:18.288
Might have beans to spill.

05:18.390 --> 05:20.390
Went by the name
of Scandinavian Skinner.

05:20.492 --> 05:21.825
Sit tight.

05:21.927 --> 05:24.294
I have history with the Skinner.

05:50.122 --> 05:53.924
You know you have,
like, no food in here, right?

05:54.026 --> 05:55.826
Selina?

05:55.928 --> 05:58.028
What are you doing here?

05:58.130 --> 05:59.563
What's-what's wrong?

05:59.665 --> 06:03.099
Why does something have
to be wrong for me to come by?

06:03.202 --> 06:04.267
Seriously?

06:08.674 --> 06:11.341
I need help.

06:11.443 --> 06:13.343
You mean money.

06:15.084 --> 06:18.014
I stole something, fenced it,
and now I want to get it back,

06:18.116 --> 06:23.687
and I'd steal it, but the fence
is difficult, so I need money.

06:24.085 --> 06:26.218
Why don't you just ask
Barbara Kean for the money?

06:26.319 --> 06:28.024
'Cause I don't want to get her involved.

06:28.126 --> 06:30.305
Look, I'll-I'll pay you back.
I just... I don't have time,

06:30.329 --> 06:32.102
because if the fence sells
what I gave them...

06:32.126 --> 06:34.035
But you still haven't told me
why you want to give it back.

06:34.059 --> 06:36.928
Because it's what I stole
from Roland Charles.

06:38.605 --> 06:40.855
The... Wayne scientist...

06:40.949 --> 06:43.116
That Ivy killed.

06:44.772 --> 06:47.272
I didn't know
she was gonna do that, Bruce.

06:47.374 --> 06:50.041
And I-I just...

06:50.144 --> 06:52.210
You feel bad.

06:52.312 --> 06:53.945
Look, if you don't want to help me,

06:54.047 --> 06:56.114
then I'll just find another way.

06:56.216 --> 06:58.084
Let me get some cash.

06:59.354 --> 07:01.727
There's oatmeal raisin cookies
in the blue tin.

07:12.065 --> 07:14.800
Why are you dragging me here?

07:14.902 --> 07:17.002
Cobblepot.

07:18.173 --> 07:21.706
Guy called, wanted me
to give you a message.

07:21.809 --> 07:23.056
Finally.

07:26.680 --> 07:30.515
"I could lend you a hand,
but you won't find me helpful.

07:30.915 --> 07:34.653
My name may sound tasty,
but the flavor is dreadful."

07:37.282 --> 07:39.257
Is it "knuckle sandwich"?

07:39.359 --> 07:41.259
Yeah.

07:41.361 --> 07:42.794
No.

07:55.209 --> 07:57.175
Hello, Agnes.

07:58.245 --> 08:00.512
Or should I say the Skinner?

08:02.616 --> 08:04.950
Detective Bullock.

08:05.052 --> 08:07.352
I don't go by that name anymore.

08:07.454 --> 08:09.688
I'm retired.

08:09.790 --> 08:13.755
- You kids, don't spoil your dinner.
- Okay, Grandma.

08:14.962 --> 08:16.695
I'm looking for someone

08:16.797 --> 08:18.475
who might have been
Don Falcone's eyes and ears

08:18.499 --> 08:19.798
when he was down south.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.433
Why would I tell you that?

08:21.535 --> 08:23.535
Because we have history.

08:23.637 --> 08:27.072
That history got me four years
in the Gulag.

08:27.174 --> 08:29.374
Either you help me,

08:30.335 --> 08:32.780
or I tell your beautiful
grandchildren how their meemaw

08:32.850 --> 08:34.746
used to skin people alive.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.192
I wonder if they
come in double chocolate...

08:36.216 --> 08:37.549
Hey, kids, you want to hear

08:37.652 --> 08:39.292
- a really funny story?
- All right.

08:39.371 --> 08:40.652
It's-it's all right.

08:40.754 --> 08:41.986
Never mind.

08:43.890 --> 08:48.226
Falcone only really trusted
the bookkeeper.

08:48.328 --> 08:49.761
The one who

08:49.863 --> 08:52.097
always smelled of fish.

08:52.199 --> 08:53.632
Mr. Penn?

08:53.734 --> 08:56.268
Yeah. Penn.

08:56.370 --> 08:58.003
But good luck finding him.

08:58.105 --> 09:00.438
I heard he vanished.

09:00.541 --> 09:01.606
Poof.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.045
How is Martin gone?

09:08.882 --> 09:11.449
Never mind.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.451
Penguin is coming.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.954
Go to Arkham and kill him now.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.488
Okeydokey.

09:17.591 --> 09:18.823
Oh, by the way,

09:18.925 --> 09:20.369
a buddy of mine
just got out of the hospital

09:20.393 --> 09:21.393
is looking for work.

09:21.494 --> 09:23.528
You mind if he tags along?

09:24.798 --> 09:26.764
Hi-ya.

09:30.957 --> 09:34.639
Just make sure Penguin dies
choking on his own blood.

09:35.675 --> 09:37.909
Why is Cobblepot in the infirmary?

09:38.011 --> 09:39.811
Heard he mouthed off to a guard.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.312
Then slipped and hit his head.

09:48.455 --> 09:49.554
Bullock.

09:49.656 --> 09:51.923
- This is a surprise.
- Hey, Oswald.

09:52.025 --> 09:53.224
Good to see you, too.

09:53.326 --> 09:54.993
I just had a few questions about

09:55.095 --> 09:56.828
about a former employee of yours.

09:58.665 --> 10:01.499
- They got guns!
- Open that door!

10:12.312 --> 10:13.845
Get out of the way.

10:13.947 --> 10:15.013
Clear out!

10:15.115 --> 10:17.248
Move, move, move!

10:17.350 --> 10:18.783
Hey!

10:19.704 --> 10:23.121
You two! Don't come any closer.

10:23.223 --> 10:25.189
Bullock?

10:25.291 --> 10:27.692
Dude, I thought you stopped being a cop.

10:27.794 --> 10:29.761
Guess it didn't take, huh?

10:29.965 --> 10:32.348
Not so much.

10:32.632 --> 10:35.466
- You remember Wendell, don't you?
- Howdy.

10:35.568 --> 10:36.928
I don't know why you two are here,

10:37.003 --> 10:38.302
and I don't care!

10:38.405 --> 10:40.638
- Walk away.
- See,

10:40.740 --> 10:43.099
I'm afraid we can't do that.

10:44.763 --> 10:47.483
We're not leaving here
without the Penguin.

10:49.730 --> 10:52.354
Harvey, do yourself a favor.

10:52.449 --> 10:54.949
Give us Penguin, and...

10:55.051 --> 10:57.362
live to get drunk another day, hmm?

10:57.440 --> 11:00.275
As tempting as that sounds, no.

11:06.583 --> 11:08.149
Let's go, let's go.

11:11.087 --> 11:12.854
It's okay.

11:12.956 --> 11:14.522
We'll come back.

11:14.597 --> 11:16.090
He's escaped!

11:16.192 --> 11:19.260
Oswald Cobblepot has escaped!

11:40.784 --> 11:43.351
Nygma.

11:44.859 --> 11:45.887
What?

11:45.989 --> 11:49.123
You're just... different.

11:49.225 --> 11:51.559
Different how?

11:51.661 --> 11:54.495
You were a complete douche
bag to me at the club.

11:54.598 --> 11:58.266
And now... you're not.

11:59.569 --> 12:01.671
Listen, Selina, about that night...

12:01.718 --> 12:05.640
Oh, no, you're not gonna try
to apologize to me, are you?

12:05.742 --> 12:07.742
No, I just wanted to say...

12:07.844 --> 12:09.323
Save it.

12:10.795 --> 12:12.190
Because you're probably

12:12.248 --> 12:14.616
gonna be a douche bag
to me later anyway.

12:17.087 --> 12:19.120
Missed you, too.

12:25.095 --> 12:27.528
Kitty cat.

12:27.631 --> 12:29.263
Back so soon?

12:29.366 --> 12:31.566
'Sup, Floyd?

12:34.437 --> 12:37.105
I'm gonna need that stuff I
brought to you the other day.

12:37.207 --> 12:41.542
Oh. You mean this stuff?

12:41.645 --> 12:45.279
The stuff you tried to break in
and steal last night?

12:45.382 --> 12:47.582
You think I wouldn't check the camera?

12:47.684 --> 12:49.183
Great.

12:49.285 --> 12:52.620
You remember what I said
about being a douche bag?

12:54.624 --> 12:57.020
I'll pay double what you gave me.

12:57.494 --> 12:59.360
This your bank?

13:02.329 --> 13:04.679
How about I take the money...

13:06.601 --> 13:08.770
...and I keep your stuff?

13:27.064 --> 13:28.256
Next time...

13:29.893 --> 13:32.049
...take the deal.

13:36.166 --> 13:38.132
Got it.

13:42.172 --> 13:44.172
I knew that as soon as I rescued Martin

13:44.274 --> 13:45.973
that she'd send her hit men.

13:46.076 --> 13:47.775
How is Martin?

13:47.877 --> 13:49.444
Snug as a bug in a rug.

13:49.546 --> 13:51.479
Here, will you hold this?

13:51.581 --> 13:53.648
So, do you want to know how I found him?

13:53.750 --> 13:57.509
So, it turns out, Zsasz...
huge fan of the disco.

13:57.626 --> 13:59.487
So, I dress up as an old Polish woman...

13:59.589 --> 14:01.255
Perhaps another time.

14:01.357 --> 14:04.492
Now that Martin is safe, we need
to focus on killing Sofia.

14:04.594 --> 14:07.195
- We need a power base.
- I know.

14:07.297 --> 14:09.564
That's why we're here.

14:15.711 --> 14:17.572
Hello.

14:19.375 --> 14:21.676
Ed. You're back.

14:21.778 --> 14:24.466
- Mm-hmm.
- How are you doing?

14:24.927 --> 14:27.376
Worlds better, honestly. Thank you.

14:27.462 --> 14:29.172
I...

14:29.228 --> 14:31.696
Oh, no. What happened to your hand?

14:31.798 --> 14:33.898
Sofia Falcone

14:34.183 --> 14:36.254
smashed it with a hammer

14:36.347 --> 14:38.703
and then threw me out on the street

14:38.805 --> 14:40.905
and put Sampson
in charge of the Narrows.

14:41.007 --> 14:42.340
I see.

14:42.442 --> 14:45.083
But, together, we can
get that bitch back.

14:45.154 --> 14:47.919
We could show her she can't just
take everything we've built.

14:48.035 --> 14:49.801
Yeah, Oswald, she can't help.

14:50.804 --> 14:52.771
What is this?

14:54.174 --> 14:56.107
What is going on? What's wrong with you?

14:56.209 --> 14:58.410
I let him out of his cage,

14:58.512 --> 15:01.780
and he, in turn, helped
me get out of mine.

15:01.882 --> 15:03.748
You're him.

15:03.850 --> 15:05.650
The Riddler.

15:06.920 --> 15:08.620
Hi, Lee.

15:08.722 --> 15:10.841
You know, I was really hoping
that you were still

15:10.927 --> 15:13.291
running the Narrows,
maybe could help us, but...

15:13.919 --> 15:15.393
guess not.

15:15.495 --> 15:17.395
Yeah, so what's your
next brilliant idea?

15:17.497 --> 15:19.431
Sofia will have turned
the Falcone mansion

15:19.486 --> 15:20.525
into a stronghold.

15:20.580 --> 15:22.400
It will be impossible to get at her.

15:22.471 --> 15:24.602
Oswald, you think I don't
have a backup plan?

15:24.705 --> 15:27.387
I'm gonna have Victor Fries
put you in a block of ice.

15:27.466 --> 15:30.690
I'm gonna take you to Sofia
like a chilly Trojan horse,

15:30.784 --> 15:33.284
pretend to hand you over.

15:33.386 --> 15:35.987
Are you kidding me?

15:36.089 --> 15:37.722
It's a fantastic plan.

15:37.824 --> 15:39.691
Try again!

15:39.793 --> 15:41.130
All right.

15:41.159 --> 15:42.792
Let me help.

15:42.880 --> 15:44.540
Look, all of your capos have
pledged their loyalty to Sofia.

15:44.564 --> 15:45.786
Do you think I can't handle it?

15:45.810 --> 15:47.198
I know you can't.

15:47.300 --> 15:48.666
Look what she did to me.

15:48.769 --> 15:50.902
I will pull the trigger
on that bitch myself.

15:51.004 --> 15:53.404
That's some tough talk, but
we both know that's just talk.

15:53.507 --> 15:55.306
Enough! Both of you.

15:55.408 --> 15:58.176
If we want to fight Sofia,
we need muscle!

15:58.278 --> 16:00.376
I agree.

16:01.328 --> 16:03.214
I can tell you where to look.

16:05.085 --> 16:07.152
Don't you think he misses you?

16:10.423 --> 16:12.824
Who is she talking about?

16:16.696 --> 16:19.030
Grundy!

16:19.132 --> 16:21.199
You down here, big fella?

16:21.301 --> 16:23.334
It's your best friend and pal,

16:23.436 --> 16:25.804
Edward Nygma.

16:27.307 --> 16:28.840
Hey, guess what.

16:28.942 --> 16:30.341
I'm smart again!

16:36.650 --> 16:38.449
There he is.

16:38.552 --> 16:40.919
Pale skin, nobody upstairs.

16:41.021 --> 16:43.121
Who's my buddy?!

16:43.223 --> 16:45.723
Correct. You.

16:45.826 --> 16:48.716
Oh, boy. So we're corralling allies.

16:48.802 --> 16:51.462
Penguin and I are gonna kill
Sofia Falcone, and we need

16:51.565 --> 16:54.761
a big galoot like you for cannon fodder.

16:54.815 --> 16:56.801
How's that sound?

16:59.581 --> 17:01.840
What's your problem? Why are you
looking at me like that?

17:04.578 --> 17:05.643
Oh, dear.

17:05.744 --> 17:07.979
You're not the only one who got smart.

17:08.080 --> 17:11.453
Okay, Butch, I helped you.

17:11.563 --> 17:13.952
You remember? Hot.

17:14.054 --> 17:16.421
Hot arm. Yeah. Ed put out fire.

17:16.522 --> 17:19.390
But you're not Ed anymore.

17:19.492 --> 17:21.693
And I'm not Grundy.

17:23.425 --> 17:24.925
Where the hell is Ed?

17:24.989 --> 17:26.489
He'll be here.

17:26.590 --> 17:29.630
No. No, he's betrayed me, too.

17:29.731 --> 17:32.228
I know it. I should...
never should have trusted him!

17:32.380 --> 17:33.593
Calm down.

17:33.684 --> 17:35.295
No, do not tell me to calm down.

17:35.397 --> 17:36.997
You have no idea what I've been through!

17:37.065 --> 17:39.266
Calm down. Ed will be here.

17:39.368 --> 17:43.837
He will bring Grundy, and
we will make Sofia pay.

17:45.874 --> 17:48.375
I can't wait any longer.

17:54.049 --> 17:56.835
How did Nygma get in touch
with Penguin anyway?

17:56.921 --> 17:59.553
- I don't know.
- Nothing's ever easy with you, is it?

17:59.655 --> 18:02.189
It's always like, "Find Lee,
and then she'll point us to Ed,

18:02.291 --> 18:03.623
"and then we'll find Penguin,

18:03.725 --> 18:06.007
and he'll tell us where to find Penn."

18:06.811 --> 18:08.991
Or we could just talk
to Oswald right now.

18:09.053 --> 18:10.296
Huh?

18:11.166 --> 18:12.819
Hey, you son of a...

18:14.470 --> 18:17.003
What are you doing here?!

18:17.092 --> 18:19.498
We're looking for an
Arkham escapee, about yea tall,

18:19.569 --> 18:21.959
walks with a limp, mommy complex?

18:22.037 --> 18:25.757
Those trumped up charges you used

18:25.875 --> 18:28.376
to put me away have lost their teeth.

18:28.478 --> 18:30.778
Martin is still alive.

18:30.880 --> 18:33.748
- So produce him.
- Nope. He is not safe

18:33.850 --> 18:36.951
until Sofia Falcone
has been dealt with...

18:37.053 --> 18:38.619
permanently!

18:38.721 --> 18:42.002
I think you and I want
the same thing, Oswald.

18:42.559 --> 18:44.892
We both want Sofia to go away.

18:45.456 --> 18:49.163
Then turn around and walk away.

18:49.265 --> 18:51.299
Let me do what I do.

18:51.401 --> 18:54.669
No. I want her in jail,
and for that I need evidence.

18:54.771 --> 18:57.171
I want your bookkeeper Mr. Penn.

18:57.273 --> 19:00.055
What would he know about...?!

19:01.695 --> 19:04.758
That little weasel was working for her!

19:04.875 --> 19:06.914
Yeah, he was working for her,

19:07.016 --> 19:09.984
for Don Falcone, everybody!

19:10.078 --> 19:12.253
You might want to check
your management style, pal.

19:14.958 --> 19:16.924
I'm gonna kill him. I'm gonna kill him.

19:17.026 --> 19:19.160
Oswald? Oswald?

19:19.262 --> 19:22.479
Calm down. You show us

19:22.549 --> 19:24.799
where we can find Mr. Penn...

19:26.302 --> 19:28.402
...and I'll let you walk away.

19:29.706 --> 19:31.806
- I don't believe you.
- Sofia sent Zsasz

19:31.908 --> 19:33.341
to Arkham to kill you.

19:33.443 --> 19:34.976
Her goons run the Narrows.

19:35.078 --> 19:37.912
How long do you think it's gonna
take till she finds you?

19:51.227 --> 19:54.295
I overheard Mr. Penn talk
about a place just out of town,

19:54.397 --> 19:57.131
near the Tricorner...
the Spa Bo'sh Sumka.

19:57.233 --> 20:00.701
Offers special therapy.

20:00.803 --> 20:03.137
If he's hiding, he's probably there.

20:03.239 --> 20:05.606
Oswald.

20:08.578 --> 20:10.682
Thank you.

20:14.364 --> 20:16.183
That's really nice.

20:16.285 --> 20:18.152
Now put your hands behind your back.

20:18.254 --> 20:19.587
- Thank you.
- Aah!

20:19.689 --> 20:22.390
- No, we had a deal!
- Harvey, what are you doing?

20:22.492 --> 20:24.103
If you want to look
the other way, Jim, fine.

20:24.127 --> 20:25.493
I didn't agree to squat.

20:25.595 --> 20:29.630
- Come on.
- No! No!

20:36.873 --> 20:39.040
- I will not forget this!
- Relax.

20:39.142 --> 20:41.342
If your information on
Penn is good, at least

20:41.444 --> 20:43.010
you'll be free of Sofia Falcone.

20:43.112 --> 20:44.445
Well, well, well.

20:45.980 --> 20:47.543
Sofia's gonna be very curious

20:47.621 --> 20:49.083
to know why you're looking for Penn.

20:49.185 --> 20:50.918
Hey, Penguin.

20:51.020 --> 20:52.219
You remember me?

20:52.321 --> 20:54.455
Oh, God, no.

20:54.557 --> 20:57.858
Wait. Is Penn important or something?

20:59.362 --> 21:01.195
That's a yes. You see that?

21:01.297 --> 21:03.898
- That's his "yes" face.
- Get him in the car.

21:06.135 --> 21:08.536
Guess I'll have to go dig him up myself.

21:08.886 --> 21:12.573
Now, you boys want to come quietly?

21:13.855 --> 21:15.955
Or do you want to do it the fun way?

21:20.318 --> 21:23.319
The fun way. Nice.

21:38.336 --> 21:40.570
- Lee?
- Shut up and get down.

21:43.008 --> 21:44.373
Lee!

21:51.817 --> 21:52.817
Come on!

21:52.851 --> 21:54.684
Let's get out of here.

21:57.155 --> 21:59.756
We need to get to Penn
before Zsasz does.

21:59.858 --> 22:01.825
We need a car.

22:16.217 --> 22:17.883
Migraines, still?

22:17.991 --> 22:20.276
It's like I've been hit
in the head with a brick.

22:20.378 --> 22:22.512
What is that stink?

22:26.389 --> 22:28.518
Should've known.

22:28.620 --> 22:30.787
Grundy smell like old dentures.

22:30.889 --> 22:32.922
It's him.

22:33.024 --> 22:34.024
I know.

22:34.092 --> 22:35.825
I can smell him.

22:36.833 --> 22:37.927
Hey there, Barbara.

22:42.200 --> 22:44.467
Scary.

22:44.569 --> 22:47.103
Nygma tried to recruit me against Sofia.

22:47.205 --> 22:48.938
He's working for Penguin.

22:50.976 --> 22:53.476
I figured after all Ed did to you,

22:53.578 --> 22:55.578
you should be the one to kill him.

22:58.784 --> 23:00.016
Wait, Butch.

23:02.220 --> 23:04.454
- Don't just walk away again.
- Tabby,

23:04.556 --> 23:07.023
I'm gonna find a way
to get back to the old me.

23:08.293 --> 23:10.026
I promise.

23:25.283 --> 23:29.244
I'll remove
your spleen with a claw hammer!

23:30.582 --> 23:32.682
Any ideas?

23:34.953 --> 23:37.053
You okay?

23:38.657 --> 23:40.892
I'm fine.

23:41.678 --> 23:43.912
We send Nygma back to Sofia.

23:44.021 --> 23:45.928
She will torture him to get to Penguin.

23:46.006 --> 23:47.931
Lee has no more allies, boom.

23:48.033 --> 23:50.400
Rebellion quelled, we're heroes.

23:50.502 --> 23:52.168
Then what about Nygma?

23:52.270 --> 23:54.704
- He just gets to walk away?
- Yes!

23:54.806 --> 23:56.706
When Sofia doesn't need him anymore,

23:56.808 --> 23:58.007
she'll kill him.

23:59.878 --> 24:04.182
Same end result, none of the headache.

24:05.050 --> 24:08.384
Well, we did find Penguin,
but then he got away.

24:08.486 --> 24:11.387
So why aren't you looking for
him instead of wasting my time?

24:11.489 --> 24:16.292
Because I also found out that
Gordon is looking for Mr. Penn.

24:22.059 --> 24:24.292
Find Penn before Gordon does.

24:24.402 --> 24:27.704
Yeah, so, Penn, Penguin...

24:27.806 --> 24:29.706
I mean, where are we, priorities-wise?

24:29.808 --> 24:31.774
Do both.

24:37.015 --> 24:38.748
Thank you for coming to my rescue.

24:38.850 --> 24:41.317
Don't bother. Without you,
I can't get to Sofia.

24:41.419 --> 24:43.219
Hmm, touching.

24:43.321 --> 24:45.321
I cannot believe I'm doing this.

24:45.423 --> 24:48.892
Believe it. No Ed, no Grundy,
we're running out of time.

24:48.994 --> 24:52.228
You know this cockamamy scheme
will probably get me killed?

24:52.330 --> 24:55.265
If it puts Sofia in the ground,
I'm okay with that.

24:56.900 --> 24:58.800
Last time you came to me

24:58.875 --> 25:01.404
with one of your schemes
to regain the city,

25:01.781 --> 25:06.042
you promised every resource I needed
to reverse my condition.

25:09.877 --> 25:11.414
So that didn't happen.

25:11.603 --> 25:14.150
An omission I regret

25:14.252 --> 25:17.420
and will rectify if given the chance.

25:17.522 --> 25:19.255
Uh-huh.

25:25.764 --> 25:27.130
God!

25:27.232 --> 25:28.998
You cannot honestly tell me

25:29.100 --> 25:30.424
you are happy here.

25:30.542 --> 25:33.377
Tinkering away on whatever...

25:33.799 --> 25:35.872
Don't touch that.

25:35.974 --> 25:38.341
You need money for your research.

25:38.443 --> 25:40.643
Sofia wants Penguin.

25:40.745 --> 25:43.212
So you deliver him to her,
you can name your price.

25:45.550 --> 25:47.750
I may have something.

25:50.722 --> 25:52.488
Keep this on you; it's on a timer.

25:52.590 --> 25:54.791
Best I can do on short notice.

25:54.893 --> 25:58.050
If being frozen affects my
brain the way it did Nygma,

25:58.136 --> 25:59.612
- I cannot afford...
- Ready?

25:59.698 --> 26:01.767
- Not yet. I...
- Don't care.

26:19.191 --> 26:21.996
So, now are you going to return it?

26:24.183 --> 26:26.010
Selina, you said...

26:26.082 --> 26:27.682
Can you do it?

26:29.085 --> 26:31.052
That's really why you came to me.

26:31.742 --> 26:34.286
It wasn't about the money.

26:44.537 --> 26:47.232
You did not kill Roland Charles.

26:50.871 --> 26:52.838
I was there, though.

26:55.009 --> 26:56.775
And what, uh, what am I supposed to say?

26:56.877 --> 27:00.412
"I... I stole your jewelry.

27:00.514 --> 27:01.914
Sorry."

27:03.384 --> 27:05.717
Sometimes that's enough.

27:18.198 --> 27:21.533
His strength of mind is impressive.

27:28.817 --> 27:31.476
You are going to tell me
where to find Penguin.

27:31.579 --> 27:33.312
Or I will make

27:33.414 --> 27:36.214
all of this look like a pleasant dream.

27:38.385 --> 27:39.551
Okay.

27:42.089 --> 27:44.990
I can be done with the teeth,
the eyes or the mind.

27:45.092 --> 27:46.158
What am I?

27:48.896 --> 27:50.329
I can be humorous

27:50.431 --> 27:52.798
but I'm never funny!

27:52.900 --> 27:56.591
What am I?

28:00.674 --> 28:02.966
Tell me where he is.

28:03.077 --> 28:04.810
I am telling you!

28:04.912 --> 28:06.778
You're just too stupid to figure it out.

28:08.882 --> 28:11.249
Ms. Falcone, you got a visitor.

28:11.352 --> 28:12.696
Kind of in the middle of something.

28:12.720 --> 28:14.019
Guy's got Penguin.

28:16.423 --> 28:17.789
Bring him in.

28:33.474 --> 28:35.807
Well, this is unexpected.

28:35.909 --> 28:39.611
Heard you were looking for Penguin.

28:39.713 --> 28:41.613
He never was a great boss.

28:41.715 --> 28:44.383
Well, well, Oswald.

28:44.485 --> 28:46.885
Is he alive in there?

28:49.990 --> 28:51.713
Maybe?

28:53.627 --> 28:56.128
I want a hundred thousand.

28:58.232 --> 28:59.831
Pay him.

29:09.009 --> 29:11.476
I'm not even gonna ask.

29:11.578 --> 29:14.079
Oh, by the way,
I found out where Penn is.

29:18.585 --> 29:20.419
Take him to the docks.

29:20.521 --> 29:23.221
Shoot him and throw him in the river.

29:23.323 --> 29:24.756
Watch Penguin.

29:25.926 --> 29:27.893
Let's go get Mr. Penn.

29:42.443 --> 29:44.710
Lovely, Ms. Gonzalez, well done.

29:44.812 --> 29:47.212
Uh, Ms. B, pull a little harder.

29:47.314 --> 29:50.215
That's, that's it, Mr. King, come on.

29:50.317 --> 29:51.383
You can do it.

29:55.723 --> 29:57.956
What fresh level of hell is this?

29:58.058 --> 30:00.392
Who is hungry?

30:05.165 --> 30:07.199
GCPD!

30:07.496 --> 30:09.923
GCPD.

30:10.704 --> 30:12.437
We're looking for Arthur Penn.

30:12.539 --> 30:14.239
What are you doing?

30:14.341 --> 30:16.708
Anonymity is a strict edict here
at the resort.

30:16.810 --> 30:18.143
I bet.

30:18.245 --> 30:19.945
What is going on?

30:23.062 --> 30:24.783
- That's him.
- Penn.

30:24.918 --> 30:25.918
Penn!

30:27.087 --> 30:29.054
Oh, no.

30:33.861 --> 30:35.860
Let's take a walk.

30:36.063 --> 30:38.078
As you were.

31:05.559 --> 31:06.958
Mr. Cobblepot.

31:07.060 --> 31:10.095
You're working for her, too.

31:10.189 --> 31:13.357
- I assure you...
- O-Of course you are!

31:13.467 --> 31:15.333
- Where is she?
- You don't understand.

31:15.435 --> 31:17.235
Where is she?!

31:25.412 --> 31:26.711
Is it done?

31:26.814 --> 31:28.214
Sofia left before I could kill her.

31:28.248 --> 31:30.048
She's on her way to stop Gordon.

31:30.150 --> 31:33.725
<i>Meet me at the Spa Bo'sh Sumka,
and we will kill her together.</i>

31:44.225 --> 31:46.131
Nygma was here.

31:46.498 --> 31:50.035
Miss Falcone tried to get him
to turn on you.

31:50.252 --> 31:51.432
What?

31:51.495 --> 31:53.872
He endured a tremendous amount of pain.

31:55.275 --> 31:57.275
He wouldn't give you up.

31:59.112 --> 32:00.645
Where is he now?

32:00.747 --> 32:03.215
Her thugs took him to the docks.

32:03.317 --> 32:04.983
To kill him.

32:15.333 --> 32:18.700
I'd worked for Don Falcone for years.

32:18.763 --> 32:20.732
Uh, before Mr. Cobblepot.

32:20.834 --> 32:23.568
When Sofia came to Gotham,

32:23.670 --> 32:27.339
Don Falcone asked me
to keep an eye on his daughter.

32:27.441 --> 32:29.007
She found out.

32:29.109 --> 32:31.409
So you made another deal with her?

32:31.511 --> 32:33.891
You weaselly triple agent, you.

32:33.977 --> 32:36.047
It's how you stay alive
in this business.

32:36.149 --> 32:38.049
And she let me live,

32:38.151 --> 32:40.018
as long as

32:40.120 --> 32:43.552
I informed to her about Mr. Cobblepot.

32:44.248 --> 32:47.006
So that's how she was able to
stay one step ahead of Penguin,

32:47.060 --> 32:48.593
with inside information.

32:48.695 --> 32:49.861
Then what?

32:49.963 --> 32:51.140
She asked me to put her in touch

32:51.164 --> 32:52.697
with Lazlo Valentine.

32:52.799 --> 32:54.266
The Pyg.

32:54.368 --> 32:56.601
So I did.

32:56.703 --> 32:59.871
- But I told Don Falcone right away.
- All right.

32:59.973 --> 33:03.108
You're coming with us.
We need your statement for the record.

33:04.912 --> 33:05.912
Get down!

33:25.033 --> 33:27.689
Get Penn out of here.
He's all that matters.

33:27.752 --> 33:29.261
We got to get you to the hospital.

33:29.308 --> 33:31.208
Gunshot will draw attention.

33:32.511 --> 33:34.812
Cops will be here soon.
I can make it till they arrive.

33:34.847 --> 33:37.548
James Gordon.

33:39.652 --> 33:41.719
We could have had a good thing,
you and I.

33:43.138 --> 33:47.215
You just had to go and ruin it.

33:47.326 --> 33:48.425
Go.

33:49.495 --> 33:50.561
That's an order.

33:56.924 --> 33:58.838
Get Penn.

33:58.971 --> 34:00.939
Get Gordon.

34:05.644 --> 34:06.744
Get out!

34:41.547 --> 34:43.347
Police!

34:43.382 --> 34:44.782
Where's Sofia?

34:44.817 --> 34:46.550
In there with Jim.

34:46.585 --> 34:48.018
Take the car.

34:48.053 --> 34:49.820
He's hurt. Bad.

34:49.855 --> 34:52.217
Get in.

35:07.606 --> 35:10.111
Can't catch a break today.

35:10.342 --> 35:12.309
Let's go get a milkshake.

35:23.756 --> 35:26.390
Jim, you really are
such a disappointment.

35:28.519 --> 35:33.555
Would it have been so bad being
in the palm of my hands?

35:33.699 --> 35:37.390
Having me chip away at your
soul little by little?

35:37.937 --> 35:42.840
Was it so important
to rob me of my revenge?

35:49.048 --> 35:51.080
It wasn't about me.

35:51.917 --> 35:54.418
I wasn't gonna give you the GCPD.

35:54.737 --> 35:57.221
Of course it was about you.

35:57.423 --> 35:59.756
Your pride, your arrogance.

35:59.908 --> 36:02.459
Do you think that what I was asking for

36:02.494 --> 36:06.527
was any different than
what my father had for 30 years?

36:07.246 --> 36:10.332
You mean your father who you killed?

36:10.569 --> 36:12.102
Yes.

36:12.418 --> 36:14.776
I killed him.

36:15.433 --> 36:17.589
Because he disappointed me.

36:17.943 --> 36:19.910
Just like you.

36:23.115 --> 36:25.659
You know, Jim,

36:25.851 --> 36:29.339
oddly enough, I still care for you.

36:29.755 --> 36:32.831
Beg me for your life.

36:33.307 --> 36:38.532
Ask for forgiveness...
and we can start over.

36:42.668 --> 36:44.468
Sofia.

36:49.647 --> 36:50.941
Go to hell.

36:57.850 --> 36:59.816
James Gordon...

37:01.987 --> 37:04.454
...this is where our story ends.

37:15.034 --> 37:16.466
You.

37:16.502 --> 37:17.935
Yeah.

37:17.970 --> 37:19.670
Me.

37:31.517 --> 37:33.448
Stay with me, Jim.

37:33.498 --> 37:34.697
Jim.

37:34.810 --> 37:36.737
Can you hear me?

37:40.538 --> 37:42.471
Come on, come on.

37:44.920 --> 37:46.486
Hey, I got a riddle for you.

37:46.522 --> 37:47.941
What's got a bullet in its head

37:47.988 --> 37:49.551
and sinks to the bottom of the river?

37:49.583 --> 37:52.083
You.

37:52.119 --> 37:54.418
The real torture

37:54.655 --> 37:58.328
is that those idiotic words
will be the last I ever hear.

37:58.825 --> 38:01.141
Just do it!

38:07.982 --> 38:10.287
Oswald.

38:11.009 --> 38:12.522
How?

38:13.278 --> 38:14.911
Did you already kill Sofia?

38:15.928 --> 38:17.555
No.

38:17.705 --> 38:20.906
She left the mansion
to pursue Jim Gordon.

38:21.342 --> 38:23.070
Why didn't you just stay at the home?

38:23.273 --> 38:25.562
Wait till she came there and killed her?

38:26.180 --> 38:28.684
Then I wouldn't have been here on time.

38:30.084 --> 38:33.027
You gave up your revenge for me?

38:41.362 --> 38:44.856
Trust is so very hard to find in Gotham,

38:46.100 --> 38:48.667
but I trust you, Ed.

39:11.926 --> 39:17.163
I have a strong desire to never,
ever see this pier again.

39:18.232 --> 39:20.199
I agree.

39:39.153 --> 39:40.528
Hey.

39:41.184 --> 39:42.722
Hey.

39:42.872 --> 39:45.157
Surprised you're alive?

39:45.182 --> 39:47.159
Oh...

39:47.195 --> 39:49.161
Yeah.

39:51.332 --> 39:52.465
How?

39:52.500 --> 39:53.966
How do you think?

39:54.001 --> 39:55.835
Lee.

39:55.877 --> 39:59.178
She kept you alive till
the medics got there.

39:59.207 --> 40:02.174
Even one-handed, she's
a damn good doctor.

40:02.210 --> 40:04.176
Sofia?

40:04.212 --> 40:05.911
In a coma.

40:05.947 --> 40:07.747
Amazing she's not dead.

40:14.889 --> 40:16.856
Harvey.

40:19.227 --> 40:22.027
When I get out of here,
I'm gonna confess.

40:22.971 --> 40:24.931
My connection to Sofia,

40:25.032 --> 40:27.486
my role with the Pyg, all of it.

40:27.853 --> 40:29.525
I got to come clean.

40:30.306 --> 40:32.321
No.

40:32.406 --> 40:34.173
What do you mean?

40:34.208 --> 40:37.282
Who would benefit from that? You.

40:37.711 --> 40:41.649
You get to be the martyr,
feel better about yourself.

40:41.852 --> 40:45.272
The GCPD loses its hero. No.

40:45.553 --> 40:47.733
You want to pay your debt?

40:48.156 --> 40:50.600
You live with it.

40:51.159 --> 40:53.125
Just like I do.

40:56.364 --> 40:59.298
So Sofia wins after all?

41:00.722 --> 41:03.238
It's what the city needs.

41:07.241 --> 41:09.807
Where's Lee?

41:10.211 --> 41:12.214
She went back to the Narrows.

41:12.380 --> 41:15.047
Said she had unfinished business.

41:23.825 --> 41:26.525
Get him, get him some more! Come on!

41:32.200 --> 41:34.083
All right.

41:34.235 --> 41:37.677
I'll go... I'll go.

41:37.849 --> 41:39.794
Oh, I know you'll go.

41:40.044 --> 41:41.907
Just not yet.

41:43.611 --> 41:45.146
Hold his hand.

41:45.213 --> 41:47.513
No! No!

41:47.591 --> 41:49.802
No!

41:49.884 --> 41:51.350
What are you doing? No!

41:51.385 --> 41:52.451
No!

41:52.486 --> 41:54.253
No! No!
