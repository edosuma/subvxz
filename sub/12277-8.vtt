00:04.796 --> 00:06.377
(SIGHING) Great.

Good morning,

going to come out of there?

00:21.522 --> 00:23.228
They were both
servicing me.

00:23.398 --> 00:25.059
I'm sorry
that I asked.

00:25.234 --> 00:27.941
Well, with Holly's essence
in SARAH's computer,

00:28.111 --> 00:30.602
I thought it might nice
to display her
in a holographic form.

00:30.781 --> 00:32.942
We were just working out
the final details.

00:33.242 --> 00:34.197
How do I look?

00:35.244 --> 00:37.735
Um, exactly like you.

00:38.580 --> 00:41.663
Oh! I asked
for bigger boobs.

You were perfect before
your untimely interruption
and you are perfect now.

I can't actually
touch anything.

00:50.259 --> 00:53.592
Yes, Holly,
I'm familiar with
the concept of holograms.

00:53.762 --> 00:57.004
Fargo, when was
the last time
that you slept

00:57.182 --> 00:58.968
or bathed
or weren't here?

00:59.142 --> 01:02.851
My love can neither sleep,
nor bathe, nor leave,

01:03.021 --> 01:04.977
so I shall do
none of these
until she can.

01:05.732 --> 01:08.018
Oh, and don't worry.
I have plenty
of sick days accrued.

01:08.193 --> 01:12.027
And I'm giving
Dr. Fargo tips on dating
a non-traditional entity.

01:12.197 --> 01:15.189
Yes, because one of you
dating my house wasn't
non-traditional enough.

01:15.367 --> 01:16.573
Hmm.

you need right now.

02:47.918 --> 02:51.410
Any chance we could
maybe nail down a date
for the wedding?

to spend together.

11:55.965 --> 11:57.671
Holly and I
might only have...

11:58.760 --> 12:00.500
Wait, might only...

12:01.638 --> 12:04.095
(GASPS) SARAH?

12:04.557 --> 12:06.058
SARAH?
Where did she go?
Is she okay?

12:06.226 --> 12:09.468
SARAH: I'm unable
to answer those questions
with any degree of certainty.

12:09.646 --> 12:12.558
As you know, Dr. Fargo,
maintaining Holly's
existence is...

12:12.732 --> 12:15.599
Just get her back
as soon as you can.
Get her back!

12:16.444 --> 12:17.775
Have what?

12:18.071 --> 12:21.563
Um, only have
until the end
of this campaign

12:21.741 --> 12:25.108
until I have to go back
to work, you know.
(LAUGHS) Oh.

12:26.955 --> 12:29.196
SARAH,
we're going deeper.

12:32.460 --> 12:33.620
Nice.

12:36.839 --> 12:39.876
If Zane wants discipline,
I'm going to give him
discipline!

12:40.051 --> 12:41.632
(EXPLOSION)
(SCREAMS)

12:41.803 --> 12:43.589
Not approved!

12:43.763 --> 12:45.549
(ALARMS BLARING)

12:47.141 --> 12:48.756
(SQUEAKING)

12:53.314 --> 12:54.975
This salad is
really delicious.

12:55.149 --> 12:56.810
Every ingredient
in your kelp salad

12:56.985 --> 13:00.148
was organically grown
right here in Eureka's
own aqua farm,

13:00.780 --> 13:04.364
the largest manmade
saltwater ocean habitat
in the world.

13:07.996 --> 13:12.114
Allie, how could you
not tell your family?

13:13.334 --> 13:16.701
(SIGHS) Jack, please,
can we just enjoy this meal?

13:17.505 --> 13:19.041
Here's an
interesting tidbit,

13:19.215 --> 13:24.676
Lake Archimedes is home
to over 10,000 forms of
aquatic life.

13:24.846 --> 13:27.963
When I'm excited
about something
in my life,

13:28.141 --> 13:30.632
for instance,
our wedding day,

13:31.686 --> 13:33.517
I like to share it
with my loved ones.

13:33.688 --> 13:34.677
And I'm going
to tell them.

13:34.856 --> 13:36.471
Okay, when?
Because it feels
like you're stalling.

13:37.358 --> 13:39.815
Oh, this from the guy
who took four years
to ask me out.

13:39.986 --> 13:42.193
I mean, what is
the big rush?
Oh.

13:42.363 --> 13:43.478
Let's just
take a breath.

13:43.656 --> 13:44.771
A breath for what?

13:44.949 --> 13:47.486
And remember,
there's no need
for you lovebirds

13:47.660 --> 13:49.321
to be shy around
Virtual Vincent.

13:49.495 --> 13:51.156
What happens
in the mobile...

13:52.373 --> 13:55.206
Lights. Um...

13:58.463 --> 13:59.327
(LAUGHS)

13:59.505 --> 14:02.247
Maybe... Maybe we should
just do this another time.

14:03.551 --> 14:04.961
I think we should.

14:06.387 --> 14:07.297
What do you mean?

14:09.098 --> 14:11.009
Well, what do you mean?
I meant lunch.

14:11.184 --> 14:13.095
Right. That's what
I meant, too, lunch.

14:15.563 --> 14:16.222
All right.

14:18.816 --> 14:20.522
Henry told me how
to take it
out of autopilot.

14:20.693 --> 14:21.808
I just got to remember
the sequence.

14:23.529 --> 14:24.689
(SIGHING)

14:25.573 --> 14:28.940
Jack...
Hold on. I...
I did it with a song. Um...

14:32.997 --> 14:33.861
(HUMMING)

14:34.040 --> 14:34.745
Seven...

14:37.168 --> 14:38.032
Jack?
Foun”

14:38.211 --> 14:39.542
Jack!
What? Yeah?

14:41.839 --> 14:43.579
Well, that doesn't
look like it's on
the programed tour.

14:45.760 --> 14:46.590
Okay, number sequence.
(ALARM BLARING)

14:46.761 --> 14:52.051
(STUTTERING)
Seven... Four...

14:52.225 --> 14:53.556
Uh...
Come on!

14:53.726 --> 14:54.841
Yes! Watch it!

14:57.980 --> 14:59.936
(SYSTEMS POWERING DOWN)

15:01.818 --> 15:05.527
Uh, I've got to say
l was expecting
something a little worse.

15:05.696 --> 15:07.527
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Auxiliary power activated.

15:07.698 --> 15:09.359
Okay, well,
whatever it was,
it fried the power.

15:09.534 --> 15:11.900
Repulsion, navigation,
communication,
they're all down.

15:12.078 --> 15:13.409
(SIGHS)
Now what?

15:14.497 --> 15:18.410
We drift down to
the bottom of the lake
and brace for touchdown.

15:22.130 --> 15:23.290
Brace, brace, brace.

15:28.052 --> 15:29.337
Again, not so bad.

15:32.849 --> 15:34.055
Wow.

15:38.479 --> 15:39.764
(GASPING) Oh!
(CARTER YELLS)

15:41.315 --> 15:42.851
(GRUNTING)
That's bad!

15:44.944 --> 15:46.184
Okay, don't move.

15:46.571 --> 15:47.731
Okay.

16:02.837 --> 16:04.168
What the hell
are those?

16:04.338 --> 16:06.624
(SIGHS) Automatic
safety shields.

16:06.799 --> 16:07.709
Okay.

16:07.884 --> 16:10.091
Jack, we are not
on stable ground.

16:10.261 --> 16:13.628
If we go over the edge,
this lab was not built
to take that kind of fall.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.639
Okay, can we...
Can we drop anchor?

16:16.809 --> 16:17.889
Uh, secure the lake bed?

16:18.060 --> 16:19.391
(CREAKING)

16:19.687 --> 16:21.302
It's okay.
We don't have an anchor.

16:21.481 --> 16:27.442
All right. Can we, uh,
maybe fire torpedoes?

16:27.612 --> 16:30.604
Jack, this is a marine lab,
not the Red October.

16:30.781 --> 16:33.693
Um, how about fire, uh...

16:33.868 --> 16:35.574
Like a grappling
hook thingy?

16:35.745 --> 16:37.986
Seriously?
Well, at least I'm trying!

16:40.750 --> 16:44.208
Wait a minute,
the lab does have
a couple of sample probes.

16:44.378 --> 16:47.245
(STUTTERING)
Ifl could bypass
the electronic trigger

16:47.423 --> 16:50.836
I could manually launch
all the probes towards
the trench at once.

16:51.010 --> 16:54.298
And maybe the reaction
will push us backwards
onto stable ground.

16:55.097 --> 16:58.260
Yeah, yeah,
that's different
from firing torpedoes.

17:02.980 --> 17:05.722
JO: And now an explosion
in the alkaline metals lab.

17:05.900 --> 17:08.983
Seriously, if undermining
my authority wasn't enough,

17:09.153 --> 17:10.529
someone could have
really been hurt.

17:10.696 --> 17:13.483
Whoa, Jo. Come on,
I didn't blow this place up.

17:13.658 --> 17:16.866
Oh, are you going to
deny these assorted
acts of spontaneity, too?

17:17.745 --> 17:20.111
Well, that one was me,
but you've got to admit
that was kind of funny.

17:20.289 --> 17:21.404
Okay, Zane.

17:21.582 --> 17:23.538
Okay, wait, wait, wait.
Uh...

17:24.252 --> 17:26.914
There is a common denominator
to a bunch of these,
but it's not me.

17:27.088 --> 17:30.376
It's water.
They're all water-based.
Look at this.

17:30.883 --> 17:33.875
Steam in thermal dynamics,
reconstituted lungfish...

17:34.303 --> 17:37.545
Fish bowling
in Fargo's office.
The avalanche of lather.

17:37.723 --> 17:41.011
Yeah, and alkaline metals
which don't exactly
play well together.

17:41.185 --> 17:42.470
Watch.

17:43.271 --> 17:47.560
The reaction's so violent
that it ignites the liberated
hydrogen gas.

17:49.527 --> 17:53.315
All right, uh...
Labidium, water.

17:55.825 --> 17:58.441
You might want to
stand back a little bit.

17:59.662 --> 18:00.902
Okay.

18:02.206 --> 18:03.537
You ready?

18:06.627 --> 18:08.413
(EXPLOSION)
(GASPING) Whoa!

18:08.588 --> 18:10.579
Multiply that by a couple
thousand grams...

18:10.756 --> 18:11.916
And you get fireworks.

18:12.091 --> 18:14.958
Yeah, not exactly
the spirit
of Feynman Day.

18:15.511 --> 18:16.717
Well, maybe this
wasn't a prank.

18:17.888 --> 18:19.503
What do you mean?
Shh.

18:20.850 --> 18:22.215
Do you hear that?
What?

18:22.560 --> 18:25.142
I think it's behind here.

18:25.479 --> 18:26.639
(GRUNTING)

18:34.405 --> 18:35.941
Broken down sprinkler?

18:36.115 --> 18:39.357
No, the lab uses
a Halon fire-suppression
system.

18:41.996 --> 18:43.987
So where's the water
coming from?

18:45.249 --> 18:47.626
Hey, Henry.
I was just headed
your way.

18:47.793 --> 18:50.170
Okay, so G.D.'s
water systems
are in the clear,

18:50.338 --> 18:52.374
no leaky pipes,
no overflows, nada.

18:52.548 --> 18:55.210
Where's this water
coming from?
Lake Archimedes.

18:56.385 --> 18:58.046
Okay, wasn't expecting that.

18:58.220 --> 18:59.380
Yeah, you and me both.

18:59.555 --> 19:00.886
l analyzed the water
from the pranks

19:01.057 --> 19:04.220
and the high content
of Artemia salina
was the same in each.

19:04.393 --> 19:06.054
It's from our lake,
no question.

19:06.228 --> 19:07.968
(STUTTERING)
Back it up, Artie,
who?

19:08.147 --> 19:11.310
Artemia salina.
Tiny brachiopods.

19:11.484 --> 19:12.724
Fowler.

19:18.866 --> 19:20.197
Whatever it is
you're doing,

19:20.368 --> 19:22.324
does it have to be done
on the tippy side
of the boat?

19:22.495 --> 19:25.282
Do you really think
I arbitrarily
just picked a spot

19:25.456 --> 19:27.117
to bypass
the electrical system?

19:27.291 --> 19:29.873
My weight hasn't
put us over the brink.

19:30.419 --> 19:32.910
I don't think a few
more minutes is likely
to make a difference.

19:33.089 --> 19:35.080
Likely is the word
I'd like to focus on.

19:35.257 --> 19:40.547
Well, I am going to focus
on my plan to move us back
from the edge of oblivion.

19:40.721 --> 19:41.756
Your plan?

19:41.931 --> 19:43.717
Which is based
on my plan.

19:45.601 --> 19:47.057
Yes, Jack,
you are the genius.

19:51.107 --> 19:52.893
Wait, that's it.
Isn't it?

19:55.152 --> 19:56.062
That's what?

19:56.237 --> 19:58.273
Why you haven't
told your family.

19:58.447 --> 20:00.824
I don't measure up
against the geniuses
you brought home.

20:00.991 --> 20:04.609
Come on. You have to know
after all these years
the differences in our IQ

20:04.787 --> 20:05.947
don't mean anything to me.

20:06.122 --> 20:07.737
Ah! So you admit
there's a difference!

20:07.915 --> 20:09.701
Of course
there's a difference!

20:09.875 --> 20:12.662
(SCOFFS) What are the odds
that we would be
exactly the same?

20:12.837 --> 20:15.453
Well, I don't know.
I'm not bright enough
to figure it out.

20:15.631 --> 20:17.041
You know what, Jack?
This is your issue,
not mine.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.126
What do you think?

20:18.300 --> 20:20.837
I go around comparing
your IQ with
my previous husbands?

20:21.011 --> 20:22.387
I do now!

20:22.555 --> 20:23.795
(LAUGHS)
You know what?

20:23.973 --> 20:27.761
Me and my genius IQ
are going to go back
to saving our lives.

20:30.646 --> 20:31.681
(GASPING)

20:34.316 --> 20:35.305
Whoa!

20:37.111 --> 20:38.442
(BOTH SCREAMING)

20:59.467 --> 21:01.423
At least we survived
the descent.

21:01.594 --> 21:02.674
Yeah.

21:03.220 --> 21:04.335
(SIGHING)

21:05.806 --> 21:07.922
So we're good?
Yeah, we're great.

21:10.311 --> 21:11.471
It's not what...

21:12.730 --> 21:13.810
(SIGHS)

21:14.440 --> 21:16.271
Never mind.

21:18.986 --> 21:20.271
(SIGHING)

21:21.572 --> 21:23.984
You know, when we don't
get back on time,
Jo will know what to do.

21:24.700 --> 21:27.032
She's built for this
sort of rescue.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.277
Great.

21:30.456 --> 21:34.665
Maybe she'll wear
her sexy cat suit
for the occasion.

21:35.795 --> 21:36.659
(SIGHING)

21:39.173 --> 21:43.507
I saw you two in the corner
of G.D. this morning
whispering together.

21:44.428 --> 21:46.919
We were whispering
about this.

21:48.182 --> 21:49.638
She's the one
who helped me
pull it off.

21:49.809 --> 21:51.674
Well, look how great
it's turned out.

21:51.852 --> 21:53.968
You're... You're still
hung up on her.

21:55.064 --> 21:57.976
That was a fake relationship
between a fake her
and a fake me

21:58.150 --> 21:59.014
in a fake computer world.

21:59.193 --> 22:02.936
A fake computer world
designed to follow
a plausible course of events.

22:03.113 --> 22:04.649
If you think that
I spend my day

22:04.824 --> 22:06.189
comparing computer world
Jo to you?

22:06.367 --> 22:08.483
That's your issue.
Not mine.

22:10.871 --> 22:11.951
(SIGHS)

22:15.209 --> 22:16.619
Jack, what are we doing?

22:18.420 --> 22:21.753
Is that a trick question?
Because I'm not very bright,
so...

22:22.091 --> 22:24.127
We never used to
be like this.

22:25.135 --> 22:27.126
I mean, our life
is becoming nuts.

22:28.264 --> 22:29.470
I hadn't noticed.

22:29.640 --> 22:31.221
Iguess
it's always nuts.

22:31.851 --> 22:34.638
But we have always
been able to get through
anything together.

22:36.689 --> 22:38.350
Jack, I'm not
worried about Jo

22:38.524 --> 22:40.810
or even the differences
between us.

22:44.446 --> 22:47.062
I'm worried about
losing what we have.

22:47.491 --> 22:48.901
You really think
that's going to happen?

22:49.076 --> 22:50.407
I think that it's
already happening.

22:51.245 --> 22:53.406
We have gotten so caught up
in the romance of things,

22:53.581 --> 22:56.573
we haven't stopped
to think about reality.

22:58.085 --> 22:59.791
The merging
of our households,

22:59.962 --> 23:02.419
our family and the chaos
of it all.

23:03.257 --> 23:05.964
Jack, our kids
will become our kids.

23:06.594 --> 23:08.676
What if things
don't work out?

23:11.223 --> 23:12.838
I never thought about
it not working out.

23:13.017 --> 23:14.678
Yeah, well, there's
a lot at stake here.

23:15.269 --> 23:16.509
I mean, it's...

23:17.521 --> 23:19.022
It's something that
we have to consider.

23:21.233 --> 23:25.101
What you and l
have built together
is sacred to me.

23:28.407 --> 23:29.647
And if we do this...

23:33.037 --> 23:33.901
And it doesn't work out...

23:38.042 --> 23:41.626
We will never
be able to go back
to the way things were.

23:41.795 --> 23:42.955
Before.

23:44.465 --> 23:45.796
At this moment,

23:45.966 --> 23:50.175
you'll get a remarkable view
of the famous
Archimedes Trench.

23:50.346 --> 23:52.632
But you wouldn't
want to take the plunge
into that abyss.

23:52.806 --> 23:55.593
That thing is crazy deep!

23:58.062 --> 24:00.895
Fowler, I found
your missing brachiopods.

24:01.482 --> 24:03.723
Yeah, along with
a cubic ton of lake water

24:03.901 --> 24:05.311
that you neglected
to mention.

24:05.486 --> 24:07.022
Oh, well, the water's
not important.

24:07.196 --> 24:08.777
Well, Dr. Fargo
might feel differently

24:08.948 --> 24:10.279
when he's swimming
to his death.

24:11.033 --> 24:13.945
Do you know how many labs,
how many projects
you've destroyed today?

24:14.119 --> 24:16.610
(SIGHING) l was trying
to fine tune
my targeting system

24:16.789 --> 24:19.030
before the marine lab
opens tomorrow.

24:19.208 --> 24:21.449
But it seems that
particle entanglement

24:21.627 --> 24:26.121
is more or perhaps
less entangled than
I originally anticipated.

24:26.507 --> 24:29.294
And Dr. Fargo's
recent redaction
of my recent redaction

24:29.468 --> 24:33.211
is contingent upon proof
that my matter-relocator
has practical applications,

24:33.389 --> 24:34.344
hence the brachiopods.

24:34.515 --> 24:36.096
Okay, less why,
more how.

24:37.101 --> 24:39.467
(SIGHING) Okay,
I have been attempting
to transfer

24:39.645 --> 24:42.682
a sample of Artemia salina
from Lake Archimedes
all day.

24:42.856 --> 24:45.814
Now my readouts show
that it's been both taken
and deposited, but...

24:47.194 --> 24:49.150
But you flooded
G.D. instead.

24:50.030 --> 24:51.645
You know,
I bet someone's
Feynman Day antics

24:51.824 --> 24:53.780
are responsible
for scrambling
my directional signal,

24:53.951 --> 24:55.566
not to mention
my job security.

24:55.744 --> 24:58.952
Okay, listen, I'm going to
deal with the pranksters
but in the meantime,

24:59.123 --> 25:00.579
I want this
machine kept off.

25:11.176 --> 25:12.256
Hey.

25:12.428 --> 25:13.668
Someone left the faucet on?

25:13.846 --> 25:15.302
No, someone left
Feynman Day on.

25:15.723 --> 25:16.553
Would you please
go and shut down

25:16.724 --> 25:18.931
any Section Five
pranks still in play?

25:20.602 --> 25:21.853
Look, I appreciate
what you're trying to do,

25:22.021 --> 25:24.478
but those guys aren't
going to listen to me.

25:24.648 --> 25:27.435
Whether you believe it
or not,
you're head of Section Five,

25:27.609 --> 25:32.194
so just stop acting
like a 12-year-old
and man up.

25:34.575 --> 25:35.530
Okay.

25:35.701 --> 25:36.816
Hmm.

25:39.163 --> 25:41.495
But ifthis
is a prank...
Zane...

25:41.665 --> 25:43.326
I'm not interested
in stooping to your level.

25:43.500 --> 25:45.456
Oh, my level. Read...

25:46.170 --> 25:47.034
Wait...

25:49.506 --> 25:52.543
Does that look like
a chunk of the new
submersible to you?

25:52.718 --> 25:54.674
Well, to me,
it looks like
a key section

25:54.845 --> 25:56.255
of the digital
integrated circuitry

25:56.430 --> 25:58.295
that powers every operating
system onboard.

25:58.474 --> 25:59.554
Worse than chunk?

25:59.725 --> 26:00.965
Yeah. Little bit.
(SIGHS)

26:01.143 --> 26:02.724
Well, the mobile lab's
not too mobile anymore.

26:02.895 --> 26:05.181
Um, how'd that get here?

26:05.898 --> 26:07.479
Fowler relocated it.

26:09.359 --> 26:10.769
Henry, please answer.

26:15.532 --> 26:17.909
And the paladin
rolls another 20.

26:18.077 --> 26:19.066
It's not very fair,

26:19.244 --> 26:21.405
your being able to control
your roll so precisely
and all!

26:21.580 --> 26:24.447
Yeah, but he's on
our team so shabam!

26:25.459 --> 26:26.665
Headshot!

26:26.960 --> 26:28.666
(PHONE RINGING)
Uh, hold on.

26:29.797 --> 26:32.254
I'm taking a sick day, Jo.
This better be important.

26:32.424 --> 26:34.255
JO: Fargo, we have
an emergency
search and rescue.

26:34.426 --> 26:35.336
We need you
at G.D.

26:35.511 --> 26:38.173
Uh, when you say
emergency,
is that with a little "E?"

26:38.347 --> 26:39.587
Doug, go!
Yeah, but we're...

26:39.765 --> 26:42.051
It's not like
I won't be here
when you get back.

26:42.226 --> 26:45.263
Don't worry, Dr. Fargo,
I'll watch after
your girl for you.

26:45.437 --> 26:46.847
I'll call you
if anything happens.

26:49.233 --> 26:50.393
Okay.

26:55.531 --> 26:57.692
(SIGHING) My turn?

26:59.868 --> 27:00.732
Tell me you found them.

27:00.911 --> 27:01.900
Yeah, we're working on it.

27:02.079 --> 27:04.912
Jack and Allison
did not take
the programed route.

27:05.082 --> 27:06.288
What about communications?

27:06.458 --> 27:08.449
No go.
We've got rescue divers
combing the water.

27:08.627 --> 27:12.085
They're doing high
and low resolution
sonar sweeps of the lake.

27:16.218 --> 27:17.754
The sweep's complete.

27:19.429 --> 27:21.385
No hits.
How is that possible?

27:21.557 --> 27:23.263
Okay, they're down
there somewhere.
We... We missed them.

27:23.433 --> 27:24.718
Impossible, unless...

27:24.893 --> 27:25.643
The Archimedes Trench.

27:25.811 --> 27:26.846
It's more than
a mile deep

27:27.020 --> 27:28.635
and that lab will not
survive the pressure
for very long.

27:28.814 --> 27:30.145
Well, how do we
get to them?

27:30.315 --> 27:32.351
We can borrow
a submersible
from the nearest naval base,

27:32.526 --> 27:35.359
but that” take hours
to prep and transport.

27:35.529 --> 27:36.564
How much oxygen
do they have?

27:36.738 --> 27:37.648
Nine hours, maybe more.

27:38.198 --> 27:41.611
If that capsule's
still intact,
we'll get them back.

27:45.622 --> 27:48.204
I trust you're both
enjoying the lobster de love.

27:48.375 --> 27:53.085
This succulent invertebrate
is one of Lake Archimedes
more voracious bottom feeders.

27:53.255 --> 27:55.120
And it's a Denison
of the aqua farms

27:55.299 --> 27:57.335
you're now passing
on the right.
(BEEPING)

27:57.509 --> 27:58.885
Really?

27:59.303 --> 28:02.261
One thing works down here
and it's got to be him.

28:02.723 --> 28:04.679
Every seafood lover
has had a bite

28:04.850 --> 28:07.136
of one of these
succulent creatures.

28:07.311 --> 28:10.098
Any seafood lover
wouldn't have it
any other way.

28:11.231 --> 28:12.767
Enjoy and I'll be back.

28:12.941 --> 28:16.149
Can you please
stop banging?

28:17.029 --> 28:18.735
It's clearly not working.

28:21.200 --> 28:22.280
Clearly.

28:22.659 --> 28:24.274
(SIGHING)
Okay, listen...

28:25.329 --> 28:27.194
I'm sure everyone's
working hard to find us

28:27.372 --> 28:31.206
so while we wait,
can we please not fight?

28:33.086 --> 28:34.246
Or bang things?

28:35.297 --> 28:36.412
Okay.

28:37.549 --> 28:39.710
Who's in the mood
for something sweet?

28:39.885 --> 28:41.546
Oh. Oh!

28:43.347 --> 28:44.553
$323
E65?

28:47.017 --> 28:48.882
Oh! The pressure!
Go! Go!

28:54.316 --> 28:55.351
Go!

29:01.156 --> 29:02.692
ALLISON: Oh!
Oh, my God!

29:17.172 --> 29:18.412
Come on!

29:18.590 --> 29:20.706
What's the point
of an airlock
if it's not air tight?

29:20.884 --> 29:21.873
I mean,
can we seal this?

29:22.052 --> 29:24.839
Jack, I don't think
we can stop this lab
from filling with water.

29:25.430 --> 29:30.299
Don't mean to be butt-inski
but might I suggest
a dessert wine?

29:33.230 --> 29:36.393
Um, I'd have to check
the Cafe Diem database

29:36.566 --> 29:37.692
and get back to you
in a jiff.

29:38.777 --> 29:39.812
Jack, wait!

29:41.947 --> 29:43.858
If he can connect
to an outside database

29:44.032 --> 29:46.523
then he has or had
a super Wi-Fi connection.

29:46.702 --> 29:48.238
I realized it
just as it left my hand.

29:48.787 --> 29:49.572
Okay.

29:50.622 --> 29:51.828
We might have
lucked out.

29:51.999 --> 29:53.660
If I can get this
thing working again.

29:54.334 --> 29:55.835
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Okay.

29:59.631 --> 30:00.916
Mayday! Mayday!

30:01.091 --> 30:03.958
Vincent, what are you...
Hello? Anyone there?

30:04.469 --> 30:07.085
Can you hear me?
Okay, we need help.

30:07.264 --> 30:09.755
We just got vortexed
or something.

30:10.684 --> 30:11.924
Oh, my God, it's Jack

30:12.102 --> 30:15.344
using Virtual Vincent's
super Wi-Fi connection
to communicate.

30:15.522 --> 30:18.138
We need to open up
a two-way signal
and lose the visual.

30:18.317 --> 30:19.853
(ALL TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

30:22.362 --> 30:23.477
Then we fell into a trench

30:23.655 --> 30:24.770
and now we're in
the airlock
which, by the way...

30:24.948 --> 30:26.154
Is not as safe
as it sounds!

30:26.325 --> 30:27.656
(OVER SPEAKER)
All right, Jack,
it's Henry.

30:27.826 --> 30:28.611
Henry!

30:28.785 --> 30:29.865
We have a submersible
on the way.

30:30.037 --> 30:31.948
It'll take a few hours,
but even in the airlock,

30:32.414 --> 30:34.530
you shouldn't be
in any danger
of losing oxygen.

30:34.708 --> 30:36.118
We'll drown before
we run out of oxygen.

30:36.293 --> 30:38.500
Henry, uh, we're going to
be underwater in less...

30:38.670 --> 30:39.625
Than 10 minutes.

30:39.796 --> 30:41.172
There's got to be
another way
to get down there.

30:41.340 --> 30:43.672
Fowler.
Hey, turn that
thing back on.

30:43.842 --> 30:46.504
Huh?
Now. Okay, he can
relocate them.

30:46.678 --> 30:48.464
He brought up a piece
of the lab earlier.

30:48.638 --> 30:49.388
It doesn't work.

30:49.556 --> 30:51.342
Zane, you shut down
all the pranks, right?

30:51.516 --> 30:53.302
Yeah, although none of them
utilize an energy spectrum

30:53.477 --> 30:54.387
that would have messed
with Fowler's system.

30:54.853 --> 30:56.593
(SIGHING) That's because
it wasn't a prank.

30:56.772 --> 30:57.727
What?

30:57.898 --> 30:59.388
I did some tinkering
since we last spoke

30:59.566 --> 31:01.522
and it turns out
my targeting system
is faulty.

31:01.693 --> 31:04.400
Even if we had
their precise location
I couldn't pinpoint them.

31:04.905 --> 31:07.021
Well, Zane, you've been
targeting me all day. How?

31:07.199 --> 31:09.781
l programed this baby
to lock onto your DNA,

31:09.951 --> 31:13.159
making you the bulls-eye
of an infrasonic meta-material
changing frequency.

31:13.330 --> 31:15.195
That's...
That's kind of brilliant.

31:15.374 --> 31:16.910
Yeah, I can pleather
her at will.

31:17.084 --> 31:18.574
No, for saving
Carter and Allison.

31:18.752 --> 31:19.992
We have their DNA
on file.

31:20.170 --> 31:22.411
If we can program
Zane's DNA
target system

31:22.589 --> 31:24.454
into Fowler's
matter relocater,

31:24.633 --> 31:26.669
then maybe
we've got a shot.

31:26.843 --> 31:28.925
Jack, it's a long shot,

31:29.096 --> 31:32.714
but we're going to use
Fowler's device to relocate
you and Allison back to G.D.

31:32.891 --> 31:36.224
I know it sounds risky,
but it's all we've got.

31:36.395 --> 31:40.229
Allison, we're trusting
our lives to this thingy

31:40.399 --> 31:43.106
that relocated a slab
of beef into oblivion.

31:43.276 --> 31:45.358
What if it mixes
our DNA with...

31:45.821 --> 31:48.403
Like fish and we end up
like mer-people?

31:48.573 --> 31:49.858
I mean, do they
even think about
stuff like that?

31:50.033 --> 31:52.945
Jack, we have to stop
worrying about
what might happen

31:53.120 --> 31:55.782
and start focusing on
what we can do right now.

31:57.999 --> 32:00.126
All right. Good idea.

32:00.419 --> 32:02.535
(SIGHING) Yeah.

32:03.130 --> 32:04.620
So what do you
want to do?

32:05.298 --> 32:06.583
Okay.

32:07.968 --> 32:08.878
(LOUD CLANGING)

32:16.852 --> 32:17.807
Okay, okay.

32:17.978 --> 32:20.640
Okay. Okay, listen,

32:21.565 --> 32:24.307
the pressure is crushing
the lab like a tin can.
Right.

32:24.484 --> 32:27.226
Okay, if we can
manually disengage

32:27.404 --> 32:28.735
while there's still
enough air in here.

32:28.905 --> 32:30.020
Right, well,
then we can float.

32:30.198 --> 32:32.314
Well, we can hope
for neutral buoyancy
at best.

32:32.492 --> 32:34.608
But we should be able to
get enough separation

32:34.786 --> 32:36.993
to stop the lab's collapse
from sucking us in.

32:37.164 --> 32:39.371
Okay. Okay.
How do we do it?

32:40.667 --> 32:42.828
There are four emergency
release levers under us.

32:43.003 --> 32:45.790
You have to pull them
all to disengage.

32:45.964 --> 32:48.046
Okay. I got it.
I'm on it. Okay.

33:00.270 --> 33:01.601
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Jack...

33:05.692 --> 33:06.852
Jack!

33:47.067 --> 33:49.649
It won't budge.
I think it got damaged
during the fall.

33:55.242 --> 33:56.072
Did you get it?

33:56.243 --> 33:57.528
DNA on demand.
Where do you want it?

33:57.702 --> 33:59.078
Right here.

34:18.223 --> 34:19.383
(INHALING DEEPLY)

34:32.612 --> 34:33.772
(GASPING)

34:35.282 --> 34:36.488
(SOBBING)

34:40.829 --> 34:42.160
The matter relocator
will be operative

34:42.330 --> 34:44.241
in a few minutes
so just sit tight.

34:44.416 --> 34:46.247
All right!
So we wait!

34:46.418 --> 34:47.703
Okay.
Okay.

34:47.877 --> 34:49.253
There's just one
more thing.
What?

34:49.421 --> 34:51.036
I've settled on a date.

34:51.631 --> 34:52.711
What?

34:53.008 --> 34:55.340
Marry me, Jack.
Right now.

34:56.636 --> 35:00.629
Are you sure?
I mean, I pictured
something a little different.

35:00.974 --> 35:02.510
And of course,
once we do this
we can't go back.

35:02.684 --> 35:04.265
I don't want to
go back.

35:06.021 --> 35:07.136
Okay.

35:07.606 --> 35:10.689
Henry, uh, you ready
for some on-the-fly
officiating?

35:11.818 --> 35:13.774
Uh, I don't know.

35:14.154 --> 35:16.691
I... l was kind of looking
fonNard to being best man.

35:17.157 --> 35:18.272
Get greedy, be both.

35:18.783 --> 35:20.444
JO OVER SPEAKER:
Well, who's going to be
the maid of honor?

35:20.619 --> 35:21.984
I'm talking to her now.

35:23.830 --> 35:24.865
All right, then, um...

35:25.040 --> 35:29.033
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered
here today...

35:29.210 --> 35:31.747
Uh, Henry, how about
the CliffsNotes version?

35:31.921 --> 35:34.958
Right. Do you, Jack Carter,
take Allison Blake

35:35.133 --> 35:36.794
to be your lawfully
wedded wife,

35:36.968 --> 35:39.129
for richer or for poorer
for as long
as you both shall live?

35:39.304 --> 35:40.510
I do.

35:40.680 --> 35:42.341
And do you,
Allison Blake,
take Jack Carter

35:42.515 --> 35:43.971
to be your lawfully
wedded husband,

35:44.142 --> 35:45.382
so long as you
both shall live?

35:45.560 --> 35:46.800
I do.

35:47.187 --> 35:48.973
Then if there are
no objections...

35:49.147 --> 35:50.057
Oh, hold on!
What?

35:50.231 --> 35:52.358
Just... I mean,
you're not...

35:52.901 --> 35:54.311
We're notjust doing
this because...

35:55.445 --> 35:57.356
I mean, we're really
doing this, right?

35:57.530 --> 35:58.656
I love you, Jack.

36:00.283 --> 36:01.443
Good answer.

36:02.077 --> 36:03.032
Bring us home, Henry!

36:03.203 --> 36:05.694
Then I now pronounce
you husband and wife.

36:05.872 --> 36:07.737
You may kiss the bride.

36:16.049 --> 36:19.382
Jack, Allison,
can you hear me?
Jack?

36:20.345 --> 36:21.380
Jack? Allison?
Can you hear me?

36:21.554 --> 36:22.964
I have a lock
on their DNA
signatures.

36:23.473 --> 36:24.383
Hit it! Hit it!

36:31.356 --> 36:32.471
(BOTH GASPING)

36:35.151 --> 36:39.019
May I present
Doctor and Mr. Jack Carter?

36:39.656 --> 36:40.862
(ALL CHEERING)

36:44.119 --> 36:45.450
Jack, we're married.

36:46.788 --> 36:47.652
How does it feel?

36:48.289 --> 36:49.449
Wet.

36:50.959 --> 36:52.324
(CHEERING CONTINUES)

36:56.715 --> 36:58.455
Okay. Here you go.

36:58.633 --> 36:59.964
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.

37:00.135 --> 37:01.295
(JO LAUGHS)

37:04.139 --> 37:05.970
By the way,
you owe me a buck.

37:06.141 --> 37:06.926
What? You're...

37:08.309 --> 37:09.890
You bet against
the wedding?

37:10.061 --> 37:12.643
I didn't think
you'd actually
go through with it.

37:12.814 --> 37:15.772
Well,
you proved me wrong,
so congrats, Carter.

37:15.942 --> 37:17.102
Thank you.

37:17.402 --> 37:19.609
We're still going through
with that bachelor party
though, right?

37:19.779 --> 37:23.692
Well, I think it...
It... It's something
we can discuss.

37:26.286 --> 37:28.777
Wow. You guys,
that was so exciting.

37:28.955 --> 37:30.911
Uh, Fowler,
you're fired.

37:32.417 --> 37:33.657
I kind of figured.

37:37.756 --> 37:38.836
Hey.

37:39.674 --> 37:42.837
So thanks for helping
Jack with my surprise.

37:44.053 --> 37:46.544
And for being
my maid of honor.

37:46.723 --> 37:49.806
Well, I... lwas
the only girl here, so.

37:49.976 --> 37:51.386
NO.

37:52.145 --> 37:53.726
You really are
my maid of honor.

38:02.697 --> 38:03.527
You can cry now.

38:04.449 --> 38:05.780
Thank you.

38:06.701 --> 38:07.941
(LAUGHS)

38:11.539 --> 38:13.370
Chicks,
what you going to do?

38:14.584 --> 38:16.040
(CHUCKLING) Okay.

38:19.088 --> 38:21.795
Don't waste a second
with her. Not one.

38:24.594 --> 38:26.209
Congratulations, Carter.

38:28.473 --> 38:29.553
Thanks, Fargo.

38:30.642 --> 38:32.348
Jack, go be
with your wife.

38:32.519 --> 38:33.725
Right.

38:35.230 --> 38:38.267
So, what's the deal
with me running
Section Five?

38:38.441 --> 38:39.942
It was my idea.
You like?

38:40.109 --> 38:41.519
Uh, yeah, but why?

38:42.403 --> 38:43.563
Because you deserve it.

38:43.738 --> 38:45.945
No. No, I don't.

38:46.449 --> 38:50.533
Everyone knows
I'm a maturity-challenged
screw-up with little to...

38:50.703 --> 38:52.239
No capacity
for leadership.

38:52.413 --> 38:54.904
That's what everyone
knew about me too.

38:55.083 --> 38:57.916
It took a timeline shift
to throw me
into the deep end,

38:58.086 --> 39:00.077
but I swam.
So will you.

39:05.468 --> 39:06.708
(INDISTINCT)

39:07.637 --> 39:10.299
Hey, you want to
talk about it?

39:11.015 --> 39:12.391
No, I'm...

39:20.400 --> 39:22.106
It's about Holly.

39:24.320 --> 39:26.436
Hey. You're here
bright and early.

39:26.990 --> 39:30.027
I got to make
a good impression
on my subordinates.

39:30.994 --> 39:35.237
Look, Zane, I may have
been a little too uptight
about Feynman Day.

39:35.874 --> 39:36.954
l was wrong.

39:38.626 --> 39:39.706
That's okay.

39:40.295 --> 39:42.377
I would apologize
for your wardrobe
malfunction

39:42.547 --> 39:45.209
except your butt
just looked so damn good
in that outfit,

39:45.383 --> 39:46.964
but I get it.

39:47.635 --> 39:49.751
It's yourjob to make sure
everyone's safe.

39:49.929 --> 39:52.261
And you take it seriously.
I can respect that.

39:54.183 --> 39:55.263
Wow.

39:55.602 --> 39:58.719
l lobbed you a softball
and you took the high road.

40:00.023 --> 40:01.809
Fargo picked
the right man
for the job.

40:05.361 --> 40:06.111
(CHUCKLING)

40:08.698 --> 40:10.609
Uh, yeah, well,
I hope you're right

40:10.783 --> 40:13.445
because I just gave myself
an assignment
that I can't screw up.

40:15.371 --> 40:19.205
Fargo gave me his trust
and I'm going to give him
something back.

40:19.375 --> 40:20.490
What's that?

40:21.669 --> 40:22.704
Holly.

40:23.922 --> 40:25.128
She's dying again.

40:25.298 --> 40:27.289
We were hoping
SARAH's processors
could handle her, but...

40:27.467 --> 40:29.423
Is there a computer
that can?
No.

40:29.928 --> 40:33.295
Whatever Holly is now,
she's more than just
information as we know it.

40:33.473 --> 40:34.804
Sustaining her
is going to take
a breakthrough

40:34.974 --> 40:37.886
in computer
programing that...
Only you can do.

40:40.104 --> 40:41.014
Exactly.

40:45.693 --> 40:48.981
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Identity confirmed.
Welcome, Mr. Donovan.

40:51.240 --> 40:52.070
(BEEPING)

40:53.785 --> 40:54.945
Hmm.

40:57.372 --> 40:59.704
I'm sure your butt
looks pretty good too.

41:18.893 --> 41:19.882
(CHUCKLING)

41:20.311 --> 41:23.098
Morning, boss. Mrs. Boss.
Don't worry,
I'm not staying.

41:23.272 --> 41:25.012
ljust thought you might
want somebody to
drop off the kids today.

41:26.526 --> 41:27.936
Andy, that's very
thoughtful of you.
Yeah.

41:28.403 --> 41:31.736
And I am going to take Jenna
to the new animation exhibit
after school.

41:31.906 --> 41:34.693
You know, to give you
guys a few more hours
of alone time.

41:34.867 --> 41:36.607
Yeah, I'm going to
get out of your hair too.

41:36.786 --> 41:37.992
You guys have been
more than patient

41:38.162 --> 41:40.369
and I can't keep ignoring
my responsibilities,

41:40.540 --> 41:42.747
but I'm thinking
of keeping
the beard though.

41:42.917 --> 41:45.454
I'm not sure if that's
a good idea necessarily.

41:46.254 --> 41:48.495
Oh, and I can't
technically leave,

41:48.673 --> 41:50.129
but I can go
into sleep mode

41:50.299 --> 41:51.914
to give you privacy
as long as you want...

41:52.093 --> 41:55.051
Okay. Okay. Stop. Um...

41:56.973 --> 41:58.429
Nobody's going anywhere.

41:58.599 --> 42:02.763
Fargo, in light of Holly,
I think maybe your
responsibilities can wait.

42:02.937 --> 42:06.725
And, Andy,
why don't you
take a sick day?

42:07.316 --> 42:11.104
Kevin, Jenna, you are
playing hooky today.

42:12.113 --> 42:13.774
So you guys
really want to
deal with total chaos

42:13.948 --> 42:16.530
on your first full day
as husband and wife?

42:17.577 --> 42:18.737
You bet we do.

42:19.203 --> 42:21.580
Our life is total chaos.

42:21.748 --> 42:23.079
And we wouldn't want it
any other way.

42:23.249 --> 42:26.787
So, come on.

42:27.211 --> 42:28.917
What's this game
we're playing?

42:29.088 --> 42:30.749
SARAH: A fantasy
role playing game.

42:30.923 --> 42:33.630
We can always add
a few more party members
to the quest.

42:33.801 --> 42:35.541
All right.
Can I be Sheriff?

42:35.720 --> 42:37.005
(LAUGHS)

42:38.514 --> 42:40.175
