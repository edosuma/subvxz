Mom's weekend place
is right off here.

25:34.968 --> 25:36.906
I thought
she was closer to the city.

25:36.972 --> 25:39.512
No, she's in Bridgehampton.

25:39.579 --> 25:41.715
Shit. [chuckles]

25:42.851 --> 25:45.957
I-I just didn't realize
we'd be so close to her.

25:47.727 --> 25:49.565
She won't bother us here.

25:49.632 --> 25:51.735
Oh, have you met your mother?

25:56.111 --> 25:57.781
She loves you.

25:58.650 --> 25:59.985
I know.

26:00.052 --> 26:01.655
I'm sorry.

26:02.658 --> 26:04.059
[sighs]

26:18.623 --> 26:20.158
[horn honks]

26:33.118 --> 26:36.358
[Talia]
I'm just so happy
someone can use it.

26:36.424 --> 26:38.529
Theo hates this house.

26:38.596 --> 26:40.332
[sighs]

26:40.399 --> 26:41.702
Says it's too big

26:41.769 --> 26:43.773
and that the Hamptons are over.

26:43.839 --> 26:45.810
Entitled bitch.

26:46.545 --> 26:49.785
I think they're just resentful
about being a trophy spouse.

26:49.851 --> 26:52.624
Well, I don't blame them.

26:52.690 --> 26:54.460
I wouldn't want to be.

26:54.527 --> 26:57.199
But that's why I'm the rich one.

26:58.636 --> 27:00.105
Follow me.

27:07.052 --> 27:09.089
And...

27:09.858 --> 27:12.129
This is Kamal.

27:12.195 --> 27:14.735
He looks like a model
playing a security guard

27:14.802 --> 27:16.338
but he actually is
a security guard.

27:16.404 --> 27:17.875
Don't worry, darling,

27:17.941 --> 27:19.410
it's not sexual harassment.

27:19.477 --> 27:21.314
I'm a lesbian.

27:21.380 --> 27:22.416
And he'll be with you 24/7.

27:22.483 --> 27:23.719
It's an honor to meet you both.

27:23.786 --> 27:25.289
I look forward to
working with you.

27:25.356 --> 27:27.193
Yeah, good to meet you.

27:27.259 --> 27:28.563
Uh, Talia,
we don't need all this--

27:28.629 --> 27:29.898
Oh, shut up. Yes, you do.

27:29.965 --> 27:31.936
No expense
is too much for safety,

27:32.002 --> 27:34.106
or even just peace of mind.

27:35.442 --> 27:38.414
Also, he's got a really big gun.

27:42.122 --> 27:43.693
[Dex]
Do we ask Kamal to eat with us?

27:43.760 --> 27:45.429
What's the protocol here?

27:45.495 --> 27:47.400
[Anna]
I already did.

27:47.467 --> 27:49.738
He said no.

27:49.805 --> 27:51.308
[Dex]
Rude.

27:51.374 --> 27:52.911
[Anna chuckles]

27:52.977 --> 27:54.948
He can't hear us, can he?

27:55.015 --> 27:56.752
You think the house is bugged?

27:56.819 --> 27:58.221
Well...

27:58.288 --> 28:00.259
[chuckles]

28:00.326 --> 28:01.528
Hey, Kamal.

28:01.595 --> 28:03.131
How big is your gun?

28:03.198 --> 28:04.868
[laughs]

28:05.737 --> 28:07.674
It's just...

28:07.741 --> 28:08.876
so exposed.

28:08.943 --> 28:10.112
You don't like it?

28:10.179 --> 28:11.682
No, I-I do,

28:11.749 --> 28:13.352
it's just...

28:13.418 --> 28:15.155
It's kind of funny,
we came out here to hide,

28:15.222 --> 28:18.729
only to be living in a house
literally made of glass.

28:18.796 --> 28:20.332
Well, you know what they say.

28:20.399 --> 28:21.367
Do not say it.

28:21.434 --> 28:23.739
People who live in
glass houses...

28:24.741 --> 28:26.444
I knew I couldn't stop you.

28:30.485 --> 28:32.924
Why is Talia doing all this?

28:32.991 --> 28:34.761
Eh, she loves us, babe.

28:34.828 --> 28:37.166
And if you sold a startup at 29

28:37.233 --> 28:38.936
and made enough money as a VC

28:39.003 --> 28:40.606
that you could help your friends
in any way you wanted,

28:40.673 --> 28:42.309
wouldn't you?

28:45.716 --> 28:47.420
I think I need a sharper knife.

28:47.486 --> 28:49.323
[clears throat]

29:13.438 --> 29:14.941
Babe?

29:15.777 --> 29:17.212
Everything okay?

29:20.921 --> 29:22.957
Everything's fine.

29:46.538 --> 29:48.274

30:34.801 --> 30:37.339
Ms. Alcott. Can I help you?

30:37.406 --> 30:39.511
I thought I heard something
coming from the basement.

30:39.578 --> 30:41.816
We don't have
any cameras down there.

30:41.882 --> 30:44.019
Why don't we go look?

31:14.079 --> 31:16.016
I don't see anything.

31:17.821 --> 31:19.223
Thank you for checking, Kamal.

31:23.866 --> 31:27.039
[woman]
Breathe in serenity.

31:27.106 --> 31:30.211
Breathe out fear.

31:31.247 --> 31:33.485
Breathe in the peace you seek

31:33.552 --> 31:35.923
for you and your baby.

31:38.762 --> 31:41.969
Breathe out any anxiety at all.

31:42.035 --> 31:43.572
[gasps, groans]

31:43.639 --> 31:45.141
Are you having pain?

31:45.208 --> 31:47.781
Yeah, just, um, just here.

31:47.847 --> 31:50.051
Try this.

31:53.525 --> 31:54.627
[clears throat]

31:56.097 --> 31:57.600
[exhales sharply]

32:03.779 --> 32:05.381
Does that help?

32:05.448 --> 32:07.186
Mmm.

32:07.252 --> 32:08.956
Just remember,
if anything is wrong,

32:09.023 --> 32:11.360
your body will tell you.

32:17.339 --> 32:20.078

32:21.447 --> 32:23.384

Are you all right, Ms. Alcott?

32:32.504 --> 32:34.239

32:41.822 --> 32:44.026
I'm taking you to the hospital.

Ms. Alcott, may I enter?

33:01.795 --> 33:03.966
Yes. Yes, thank you.

33:04.033 --> 33:05.135
My name is Ivy.
It's nice to meet you.

33:05.202 --> 33:06.805
How are you feeling?

33:06.872 --> 33:08.407
Do I know you?

33:10.011 --> 33:11.181
I don't think so.

33:11.247 --> 33:12.449
Blood pressure is 121/80.

33:12.517 --> 33:16.090
That's good.
Temperature is normal.

33:19.631 --> 33:21.267

[coughs]

You look so familiar.

33:34.193 --> 33:35.730
I just transferred.

33:35.797 --> 33:36.765
Oh, from the city?

33:36.832 --> 33:38.167
Toronto.

33:38.234 --> 33:39.972
I understand
that you're pregnant?

33:40.038 --> 33:41.942
-Yes.
-Congratulations.

33:42.008 --> 33:43.946
How many weeks?

33:44.013 --> 33:45.282
Twelve.

33:45.349 --> 33:46.685
And it sounds like
you're experiencing

33:46.751 --> 33:48.388
some lower back pain
as well as some bleeding?

33:48.455 --> 33:50.291
-That's right.
-All right.

33:50.358 --> 33:51.561
I'm going to
perform an ultrasound

33:51.628 --> 33:54.399
-with your permission.
-Of course.

Do you see a heartbeat?

35:18.167 --> 35:20.338
the ultrasound, Ms. Alcott.

I, um, I had my phone off

and I was taking a nap.

-why?
-We don't.

37:39.116 --> 37:41.320
But I can tell you
that most miscarriages

are the result of
an undetected abnormality.

It's not your fault.

The sex?

Anna.

37:52.576 --> 37:54.280
I want to know.

of Y chromosome.

38:01.360 --> 38:03.732
I know this is incredibly hard,

38:03.798 --> 38:05.736
but I need to take an ultrasound

38:05.802 --> 38:07.974
to determine whether
there is any fetal tissue

38:08.040 --> 38:09.343
remaining in your uterus.

38:09.409 --> 38:11.714
I already had an ultrasound.

Dr. Hill sent your records over.
