00:00.052 --> 00:03.205
My name is Michael Westen
I used to be a spy until...

00:04.742 --> 00:07.309
We got a burn notice
on you. You're blacklisted.

00:07.376 --> 00:09.753
When you're burned,
you've got nothing -

00:09.821 --> 00:12.408
No cash, no credit,
no job history.

00:12.475 --> 00:14.772
You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.

00:14.839 --> 00:16.807
Where am I?
Miami.

00:16.875 --> 00:20.045
You do whatever work
comes your way.

00:20.112 --> 00:22.680
You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you.

00:22.747 --> 00:25.917
- A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...
- Should we shoot them?

00:25.984 --> 00:28.490
...An old friend who used
to inform on you to the FBI...

00:28.557 --> 00:30.892
You know spies -
a bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:30.960 --> 00:33.427
...Family, too...
Hey, is that your mom again?

00:33.495 --> 00:35.596
...If you're desperate. Someone
needs your help, Michael.

00:35.664 --> 00:38.100
Bottom line -
as long as you're burned,

00:38.168 --> 00:40.068
You're not going anywhere.

00:43.177 --> 00:44.879
Previously on "burn notice"...

00:44.880 --> 00:46.947
Sam: Mike, what the hell
is going on over there?

00:47.015 --> 00:48.915
Sam, you know that prisoner
we tried to keep from escaping?

00:48.948 --> 00:50.115
Don't tell me.

00:50.116 --> 00:51.951
He's out, Sam.
He's free.

00:51.952 --> 00:54.454
His name's Simon.
That's all I know.

00:54.522 --> 00:56.022
Madeline Westen?

00:56.023 --> 00:57.651
Yes?
FBI.

00:57.652 --> 01:01.722
I saw your son attack
a police officer, Mrs. Westen!

01:01.790 --> 01:03.857
Your son shot at me!
He tried to kill me!

01:05.393 --> 01:08.030
You have no idea
who your own son really is!

01:08.097 --> 01:11.699
If Michael wanted to kill you,
you'd be dead.

01:11.767 --> 01:13.667
You are under arrest.

01:14.403 --> 01:15.569
Me and Fi want to talk to you

01:15.570 --> 01:16.570
About this whole business
with Simon.

01:16.571 --> 01:18.238
No more lone-wolf crap.

01:18.239 --> 01:19.605
We gotta know
that you're with us.

01:19.606 --> 01:21.308
I'm with you.
Good.

01:21.309 --> 01:23.043
We're gonna be careful. We're
gonna watch each other's backs.

01:23.044 --> 01:24.944
Combat knives for everyone
just in case.

01:24.979 --> 01:26.145
Sorry, guys.

01:26.146 --> 01:28.046
Was that an apology?

01:32.718 --> 01:34.919
Michael Westen.

01:34.987 --> 01:36.854
I'm calling about
a former employee of yours -

01:36.855 --> 01:38.256
Simon.

01:38.257 --> 01:39.090
Simon got away.

01:39.091 --> 01:40.324
He's with management.

01:40.325 --> 01:41.959
I'm going after him.

01:41.960 --> 01:43.494
No, we talked about this!
We're in this together!

01:43.495 --> 01:45.495
You can't follow me
this time, Fi.

01:50.400 --> 01:52.300
Put the gun down!

01:52.735 --> 01:54.535
Oh, he owes you now, boy.

01:54.536 --> 01:55.536
It's just a matter of time...

01:55.537 --> 01:57.437
Till you're just like me.

01:58.440 --> 01:59.606
Just like me.

01:59.607 --> 02:02.075
Just like me.

02:02.143 --> 02:03.109
Where's my son?

02:03.110 --> 02:04.243
I have no idea.

02:04.244 --> 02:06.879
God only knows
what hole he's in now.

02:06.947 --> 02:09.515
He is gone!

02:11.000 --> 02:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:21.861 --> 02:24.629
Name brands and decor
can often tell you a lot

02:24.696 --> 02:26.630
About who you're dealing with.

02:26.698 --> 02:29.766
Official agencies operate
with government budgets.

02:29.834 --> 02:33.069
You can usually rule out
the idea of federal involvement

02:33.137 --> 02:34.938
As soon as you see
a pricey antique

02:34.939 --> 02:37.773
Or a pair of $1,200 shoes.

02:39.272 --> 02:41.040
Michael Westen.

02:41.041 --> 02:42.941
In the flesh.

02:43.777 --> 02:45.944
It's an honor.
Truly.

02:49.615 --> 02:51.715
Hey, have a piece of fruit.

02:51.783 --> 02:53.984
We get the best
tangerines here.

02:54.052 --> 02:55.185
Where am I?

02:55.186 --> 02:56.920
Ah, well...

02:56.921 --> 03:02.225
Some folks call it
a private holding facility,

03:02.293 --> 03:03.826
Others, a secret prison,

03:03.827 --> 03:05.895
And...I think
it's officially listed

03:05.963 --> 03:07.797
As a document-processing
center.

03:07.798 --> 03:09.698
So you can take your pick.

03:10.601 --> 03:12.501
Here.
Have a tangerine.

03:14.571 --> 03:16.405
I'm not hungry.

03:16.406 --> 03:18.073
Why am I here?

03:18.074 --> 03:19.974
We have a lot to talk about.

03:21.174 --> 03:24.809
That business
between Simon and management.

03:24.877 --> 03:27.812
It's the tip
of a very nasty iceberg.

03:27.879 --> 03:29.747
Great work, by the way.

03:29.748 --> 03:31.648
Rescuing the old man
like you did.

03:31.649 --> 03:33.417
Trust me,
I didn't do it for him.

03:33.418 --> 03:34.851
But you did it.

03:34.852 --> 03:36.519
And now he's back

03:36.520 --> 03:38.454
At an undisclosed location.

03:38.522 --> 03:40.856
And Simon
is locked away tight -

03:40.924 --> 03:43.125
All thanks to Michael Westen.

03:43.192 --> 03:45.060
I know you're upset
that we burned you,

03:45.061 --> 03:47.261
But it's nice to know that we
can work together sometimes,

03:47.329 --> 03:48.262
When it counts.

03:48.263 --> 03:49.363
Huh?

03:49.364 --> 03:51.264
Friends at last.

03:54.702 --> 03:56.103
I'm not your friend.

03:56.104 --> 03:58.605
I'll try not
to take that personally.

03:58.673 --> 04:00.607
Now, you've had a long day.

04:00.675 --> 04:02.575
Here's some reading material...

04:02.643 --> 04:04.043
To pass the time.

04:04.044 --> 04:05.944
I think you'll find that
interesting.

04:09.247 --> 04:11.382
Let me know
when you're ready to talk.

04:27.899 --> 04:31.869
It takes a while to learn
how to read intelligence files.

04:36.307 --> 04:38.975
They start as stacks
of unrelated documents,

04:39.042 --> 04:42.443
But stick with it long enough
and a pattern can emerge.

04:42.511 --> 04:45.545
Of course, not all
intelligence is reliable,

04:45.613 --> 04:49.282
Which means when you're done
checking the file...

04:49.350 --> 04:51.984
You have to check the source.

04:52.052 --> 04:53.952
Guard!

04:57.457 --> 04:59.724
I read your file.
What does it all mean?

04:59.792 --> 05:01.592
Why don't you tell me?

05:01.593 --> 05:02.960
Come. Sit.

05:02.961 --> 05:04.861
Assassinations, crop burnings,

05:04.896 --> 05:06.362
Little wars around the world,

05:06.363 --> 05:08.864
All connected
to some fat bank accounts.

05:08.932 --> 05:10.733
Very interesting.

05:10.734 --> 05:12.134
What does it have to do
with me?

05:12.135 --> 05:13.635
Well, that depends.

05:13.636 --> 05:15.069
Depends on what?

05:15.070 --> 05:16.304
On whether
we can work together.

05:16.305 --> 05:18.139
We need your help, Michael.

05:18.140 --> 05:19.340
Ha ha.

05:19.341 --> 05:21.074
You need my help.

05:21.075 --> 05:23.009
See? All this?

05:23.077 --> 05:24.744
We're trying to stop it.

05:24.745 --> 05:28.147
And whoever owns those fat
bank accounts is fighting back.

05:28.214 --> 05:30.682
Simon's escape
wasn't some kind of accident.

05:30.750 --> 05:32.484
It was an attack -
against us.

05:32.485 --> 05:34.585
Who is us, exactly?

05:34.653 --> 05:36.787
There's some things
governments do well,

05:36.855 --> 05:38.755
Like run a military
or a post office.

05:38.790 --> 05:41.291
And then there are some things
that they need help with,

05:41.359 --> 05:43.426
Things best done
by people who...

05:43.494 --> 05:46.162
No longer have official ties
to the government.

05:46.229 --> 05:48.063
Like burned spies.
Precisely.

05:48.064 --> 05:50.299
And that's where we come in.

05:50.367 --> 05:51.900
Where you come in.

05:51.901 --> 05:53.802
I know you have a lot
of connections.

05:53.870 --> 05:55.304
I find it hard to believe

05:55.305 --> 05:57.172
That you can't do this
without me.

05:57.173 --> 05:58.373
Listen, Michael,

05:58.374 --> 06:00.075
If this was some
foreign government,

06:00.076 --> 06:01.243
You might be right.

06:01.244 --> 06:02.444
We're good at that sort
of thing.

06:02.445 --> 06:03.846
But this -

06:03.847 --> 06:05.347
This is a new kind of problem.

06:05.348 --> 06:08.716
This is somebody willing to let
a guy like Simon blow up Miami

06:08.784 --> 06:10.317
To protect his cash flow.

06:10.318 --> 06:12.419
I mean, bottom line -
you may not like it,

06:12.487 --> 06:14.221
But we're
on the same side here.

06:14.222 --> 06:16.790
Forgive me if I'm a little
skeptical about that.

06:16.857 --> 06:18.757
Look, I know you've had
bad experiences

06:18.793 --> 06:20.693
With some of our operatives.

06:21.462 --> 06:24.798
Look, and a few turned out
to be unstable, corrupt,

06:24.865 --> 06:27.834
Occasionally psychopathic,
but the point is, Michael,

06:27.902 --> 06:30.236
That's over.

06:30.304 --> 06:33.606
There's a reason
why we recruited you.

06:33.674 --> 06:35.541
I'm glad you changed
your hiring policies,

06:35.542 --> 06:37.574
But flattery's not gonna
make me work for you.

06:37.642 --> 06:39.472
Nobody's making you
do anything, Michael.

06:39.473 --> 06:41.373
Look, I understand
your reservations.

06:41.408 --> 06:42.637
I mean, we burned you.

06:42.638 --> 06:44.236
And our methods -

06:44.237 --> 06:46.805
Well, let's just say we draw
the line at different places.

06:46.873 --> 06:48.239
But at the end of the day,

06:48.240 --> 06:49.574
You're gonna want
to side with us,

06:49.575 --> 06:51.976
Rather than whoever's
behind all of this.

06:52.044 --> 06:53.678
And we need to find him.

06:53.679 --> 06:55.346
I'm gonna be your errand boy?

06:55.347 --> 06:57.582
Not an errand boy, Michael,

06:57.650 --> 06:59.550
A partner.

07:00.552 --> 07:02.820
Now, you wanted the file.

07:02.887 --> 07:04.988
Where would you start?

07:07.289 --> 07:09.189
When you peel away
the shell companies

07:09.191 --> 07:11.192
And the dummy bank accounts,

07:11.259 --> 07:12.693
A lot of these little wars

07:12.694 --> 07:14.594
All track back to
the same weapon supplier,

07:14.595 --> 07:15.995
Gregory hart.

07:15.996 --> 07:18.230
He uses a sat phone
to do his banking.

07:18.298 --> 07:20.534
You can find him with that.

07:20.602 --> 07:23.871
If I were you,
I would talk to him.

07:23.939 --> 07:25.839
Why don't we talk
to him together?

07:25.840 --> 07:27.140
I'll set it up.

07:27.141 --> 07:29.509
We'll go down and see
what he has to say.

07:29.576 --> 07:31.577
And then
you can decide whether...

07:31.644 --> 07:34.579
You're in or out.

07:56.332 --> 07:58.200
First time out of Miami
in a while, huh?!

07:58.201 --> 07:59.768
How's it feel?!

07:59.769 --> 08:01.102
Lovely!

08:01.103 --> 08:03.003
We've got hart in
the guerilla camp up the road!

08:04.940 --> 08:06.840
Sounds like
they're ready for us!

08:09.710 --> 08:11.610
Hey, I said it's a new day,
didn't I?

08:15.614 --> 08:17.381
Hey, you want to shoot me?
Go for it!

08:17.382 --> 08:19.016
I'll take a rain check!

08:19.017 --> 08:20.384
Yeah, that's the spirit.

08:20.385 --> 08:22.885
All right, let's do this.

08:22.952 --> 08:26.119
Illegal-weapon sales is a
multimillion-dollar industry.

08:26.187 --> 08:27.787
For a big-time gun runner,

08:27.788 --> 08:29.021
It's easy to live
the life of luxury.

08:29.022 --> 08:30.789
The problem is,

08:30.790 --> 08:32.256
When you've spent your career
dodging local law enforcement

08:32.256 --> 08:33.691
And making mortal enemies,

08:33.692 --> 08:36.126
It's much safer hiding
in a tent in the jungle

08:36.193 --> 08:38.929
Than enjoying a piece
of beachfront property.

08:38.996 --> 08:43.232
Congratulations.
You got me.

08:43.299 --> 08:46.335
I assume you want to talk to me,
so what's on your mind?

08:49.105 --> 08:51.673
Well, let's start with,
"who do you work for?"

08:51.741 --> 08:53.974
This is gonna be a very
disappointing conversation

08:54.043 --> 08:55.844
For you,
'cause I don't know anything.

08:55.845 --> 08:57.745
Yeah, well,
you can do better than that.

08:57.746 --> 08:59.347
These weapons
came from someplace,

08:59.348 --> 09:00.414
They're going someplace.

09:00.415 --> 09:02.016
Now, who do you work for?

09:02.017 --> 09:04.117
I work for a 16-digit
swiss bank account

09:04.185 --> 09:05.986
And an anonymous
e- mail address.

09:05.987 --> 09:07.887
Huh?

09:10.990 --> 09:12.891
Vaughn.

09:15.194 --> 09:16.494
Aah!

09:16.495 --> 09:18.629
Do you think
that's gonna do any good?!

09:18.697 --> 09:22.199
I work for a man
who values his privacy!

09:22.267 --> 09:24.468
Now, you can shoot me
as much as you want,

09:24.536 --> 09:26.103
But it's not gonna do any good,

09:26.104 --> 09:27.304
'cause I was a dead man

09:27.305 --> 09:29.205
The moment
you started coming for me.

09:32.910 --> 09:34.173
We gotta go now!

09:34.174 --> 09:35.706
With thermal imaging

09:35.707 --> 09:37.540
And laser-target designators,

09:37.541 --> 09:39.208
An unmanned drone
allows your enemy

09:39.209 --> 09:40.576
To launch a precise strike

09:40.577 --> 09:42.212
While staying
completely anonymous.

09:42.213 --> 09:44.314
All you really know is that
whoever you're up against

09:44.382 --> 09:45.782
Has deep pockets

09:45.783 --> 09:47.951
And isn't afraid
of tying up loose ends.

09:48.018 --> 09:49.719
Surviving a drone attack

09:49.720 --> 09:51.520
Is about escaping
the primary target area.

09:51.521 --> 09:53.088
That being said,

09:53.089 --> 09:54.989
Dodging bullets
and antitank missiles...

09:58.793 --> 10:00.960
...Isn't exactly
a walk in the park.

10:07.966 --> 10:09.433
Okay, Michael.

10:09.434 --> 10:11.935
Are you in, or are you out?

10:14.988 --> 10:23.468
Transcript by www.addic7ed.com

10:26.365 --> 10:28.499
My, my, my.

10:28.567 --> 10:30.467
It is nice to be
out of the jungle.

10:33.006 --> 10:34.910
And how was your flight,
by the way?

10:34.978 --> 10:37.046
Fine. I love spending 10 hours
in the cargo bay.

10:37.114 --> 10:38.612
How's the shoulder?

10:38.613 --> 10:41.980
Well, my dreams of pitching
for the Yankees are over.

10:42.048 --> 10:43.314
This isn't the first time

10:43.315 --> 10:45.015
This sort of thing
has happened, Michael.

10:45.016 --> 10:47.417
Whoever's behind all this
is killing our people.

10:47.485 --> 10:48.618
And not just ours.

10:48.619 --> 10:50.519
CIA,
German intelligence -

10:50.520 --> 10:52.420
Anyone who gets close
gets dead.

10:52.422 --> 10:54.589
So now it's my turn?

10:54.657 --> 10:56.925
I'm not gonna lie.
It's dangerous.

10:56.992 --> 10:59.426
But we're betting
that Michael Westen can succeed

10:59.494 --> 11:00.994
Where others have failed.

11:00.995 --> 11:02.462
So you see
what we're up against.

11:02.463 --> 11:05.331
Simon, the file,
and this business with hart.

11:05.399 --> 11:07.299
You feeling helpful?

11:15.174 --> 11:18.242
Hart had a government file
with them.

11:18.310 --> 11:21.010
Something I noticed
when you were shooting holes

11:21.078 --> 11:22.745
In his lower extremities.

11:22.746 --> 11:24.013
If I had to guess,

11:24.014 --> 11:25.714
I'd say he was the subject

11:25.715 --> 11:27.883
Of some kind of
federal investigation.

11:29.251 --> 11:30.318
I love it.

11:30.319 --> 11:31.586
Hey, we're a team already.

11:31.587 --> 11:33.754
Just so we understand
each other -

11:33.822 --> 11:35.489
This is my investigation.

11:35.490 --> 11:37.891
Simon came after me,
you asked for my help,

11:37.959 --> 11:39.025
We do it my way.

11:39.026 --> 11:41.527
Understood.

11:41.594 --> 11:44.062
There's a car
waiting for you outside.

11:44.129 --> 11:46.029
Say hello to your mother
for me.

12:04.983 --> 12:06.883
Mom.

12:07.885 --> 12:09.785
Welcome home, Michael.

12:15.026 --> 12:16.393
When I got the call
that you were coming back,

12:16.394 --> 12:18.294
The guy on the phone
was a little vague.

12:19.097 --> 12:21.298
I wasn't entirely sure they
weren't shipping pieces of you

12:21.366 --> 12:22.533
Back in a cardboard box.

12:22.534 --> 12:24.434
I think I'm all here.

12:26.171 --> 12:27.838
Well, it's good
to have you home.

12:27.839 --> 12:29.406
Want a tuna-fish sandwich?

12:29.407 --> 12:30.841
Maybe later.

12:30.842 --> 12:32.810
Have you heard from Fi?
Um...

12:32.877 --> 12:35.645
I left a message that
you were coming home, but...

12:35.713 --> 12:37.313
No, we haven't talked.

12:37.314 --> 12:39.716
I think she's probably
just taking some time...

12:39.783 --> 12:41.620
To herself to...

12:41.621 --> 12:43.521
Sort through all this,
you know?

12:43.524 --> 12:44.991
You really should go see her,
Michael.

12:44.992 --> 12:46.892
I'm sorry, mom.

12:48.529 --> 12:50.730
About everything.

12:50.798 --> 12:52.598
Go.

12:52.599 --> 12:54.499
We'll talk later.

12:57.708 --> 13:00.543
The strain of having
a loved one disappear for weeks

13:00.611 --> 13:03.112
Affects people differently.

13:03.180 --> 13:05.247
Spend enough time
as a covert operative,

13:05.315 --> 13:06.982
And you know better
than to try to predict

13:06.983 --> 13:09.051
The outcome
of a long-awaited reunion.

13:12.221 --> 13:14.054
Michael.

13:14.055 --> 13:15.955
Thank God.

13:18.688 --> 13:21.188
Of course, some reunions are
more unpredictable than others.

13:21.254 --> 13:22.521
Fi?

13:22.522 --> 13:23.721
I'm sorry. We're in the middle
of something.

13:23.722 --> 13:24.722
Here, load this.

13:24.723 --> 13:27.225
Sam and I took a case,

13:27.293 --> 13:28.793
And it's gotten
a little out of hand.

13:28.794 --> 13:31.362
Our client is this lawyer,
Winston.

13:31.429 --> 13:34.031
He was, uh, helping
this girl with her ex.

13:34.098 --> 13:36.733
The, uh, restraining order
didn't work,

13:36.801 --> 13:39.735
So he got this judge to impound
the guy's bike.

13:39.803 --> 13:41.837
But the guy turned out to be
the enforcer of the breakers.

13:41.905 --> 13:43.272
Breakers?
Biker gang.

13:43.273 --> 13:44.506
Baddest in South Florida.

13:44.507 --> 13:45.841
They green-lit Winston.

13:45.842 --> 13:47.075
I guess he had the bright idea

13:47.076 --> 13:48.976
To try to pay the guy
to leave him alone.

13:49.412 --> 13:51.446
Oh, that's Sam.

13:51.514 --> 13:52.547
Come on.

13:52.548 --> 13:54.115
Let's go.

13:54.116 --> 13:56.016
Fi -

13:59.553 --> 14:00.820
Missed you, brother.

14:00.821 --> 14:02.721
You and I are gonna get
a beer together,

14:02.722 --> 14:05.624
Just as soon as this little
disaster of Fiona's is handled,

14:05.692 --> 14:07.092
I promise.
My disaster?

14:07.093 --> 14:08.359
You're the one who thought
he could call the cops

14:08.360 --> 14:09.728
To solve this whole thing.

14:09.729 --> 14:11.730
Ha, for the record,
they arrested two guys.

14:11.797 --> 14:13.431
Bikers don't care
if they get arrested!

14:13.432 --> 14:14.866
My point is, calling the cops

14:14.867 --> 14:16.701
Was a lot more effective
than your genius idea.

14:16.702 --> 14:18.802
Fi, I -
have some biker friends.

14:18.870 --> 14:20.137
I made some calls,

14:20.138 --> 14:21.071
See if they can
help out a little,

14:21.072 --> 14:22.405
Maybe get some firepower.

14:22.406 --> 14:23.839
Yeah, right, and they got
their butts kicked

14:23.840 --> 14:24.873
From here to Shreveport.

14:24.874 --> 14:26.107
Guys! Guys!

14:26.108 --> 14:28.742
I have a loaded machine pistol
in my hand,

14:28.810 --> 14:30.544
And I have no idea
what I'm doing!

14:30.545 --> 14:32.211
Okay, here's the short version.

14:32.212 --> 14:34.480
This biker guy, hunter,
is at the lawyer's place,

14:34.548 --> 14:35.614
And...He brought a posse.

14:35.615 --> 14:37.083
Posse?
Yeah.

14:37.084 --> 14:38.920
Two, maybe three?
I think it was two.

14:38.921 --> 14:40.654
Anyway, when Winston called,
he was a mess.

14:40.655 --> 14:42.122
So we got to get him
out of there

14:42.123 --> 14:44.091
Without making the situation
even worse than it is.

14:44.159 --> 14:45.525
Bottom line here, Mike -

14:45.526 --> 14:47.426
This whole business
needs a little Michael Westen.

14:49.262 --> 14:50.729
Get out here!

14:50.730 --> 14:52.630
This is everything I have,
okay?! This is all my money!

14:56.169 --> 14:58.202
Take it and go away!

14:58.270 --> 14:59.937
You think I want your money?!

14:59.938 --> 15:02.306
The tough thing
about being marked for death

15:02.374 --> 15:03.807
By a criminal organization

15:03.808 --> 15:05.709
Is the fact
that once the order is given,

15:05.777 --> 15:07.977
The whole organization's
after you.

15:08.045 --> 15:10.179
It ceases to be
about an individual

15:10.246 --> 15:12.681
And becomes about the honor
of the group.

15:12.749 --> 15:14.749
And when honor is involved,
things tend to get bloody.

15:14.817 --> 15:16.418
You're a dead man!

15:16.419 --> 15:18.152
You hear me?!

15:18.153 --> 15:20.053
Dead!

15:22.424 --> 15:23.757
Please,
that's everything I got.

15:23.758 --> 15:26.026
No, stop!
Don't do that!

15:28.062 --> 15:30.397
Get out, or we're coming in!

15:30.464 --> 15:32.331
Stay here.

15:32.332 --> 15:33.566
Are you sure, Mike?
Yeah, Sam.

15:33.567 --> 15:35.434
This isn't a situation
we want to shoot it out.

15:35.435 --> 15:36.701
I'm gonna see
if I can bluff it.

15:36.702 --> 15:38.336
Bluff it?

15:38.337 --> 15:39.637
Well, at least
take some better cards.

15:39.638 --> 15:40.938
All right, hang back.

15:40.939 --> 15:43.073
Don't make a move
unless things go bad.

15:43.141 --> 15:44.408
And if things go bad?

15:44.409 --> 15:46.643
Well, it was nice
seeing you guys again.

15:46.711 --> 15:48.678
Hunter:
I'm gonna give you 10 seconds!

15:48.746 --> 15:51.280
10, 9...

15:51.348 --> 15:53.248
Please!
8...

15:53.716 --> 15:55.616
7...

16:04.292 --> 16:06.426
Who the hell are you?

16:06.494 --> 16:08.729
I'm the guy telling you
to get the hell out of here now.

16:08.796 --> 16:10.696
Is that so?

16:12.966 --> 16:15.631
I count three of us...
And one of you.

16:15.699 --> 16:18.099
I like that math, pal.

16:18.167 --> 16:19.333
Here's some math.

16:19.334 --> 16:21.334
You got semiautomatic
.45 caliber pistols.

16:21.402 --> 16:23.603
Me?
Mac-10s on full auto.

16:23.670 --> 16:25.938
I fire five rounds
at every one of yours.

16:26.005 --> 16:27.572
I can still drop you.

16:27.573 --> 16:29.540
And I'll at least
take two of you with me.

16:29.607 --> 16:31.507
You like those odds, go for it.

16:36.779 --> 16:38.679
You know who
you're messing with?

16:38.747 --> 16:40.247
Your little buddy in there

16:40.248 --> 16:43.016
Has got every breaker
in five states coming for him -

16:43.084 --> 16:44.350
Coming hard.

16:44.351 --> 16:45.884
I know exactly
who I'm messing with,

16:45.885 --> 16:47.485
And I'll pretend
that means something

16:47.486 --> 16:49.420
For three more seconds.

16:58.694 --> 17:00.594
We'll be back, pal.

17:01.563 --> 17:03.463
Count on it.

17:17.049 --> 17:18.650
Okay.

17:18.651 --> 17:20.550
So, who's that guy again?

17:26.954 --> 17:29.357
Fiona:
Sorry about all that.

17:29.425 --> 17:31.159
We told Winston
to stay out of sight,

17:31.160 --> 17:33.061
But, you know,
I guess they didn't go over

17:33.128 --> 17:35.028
Negotiating with biker gangs
in law school.

17:38.166 --> 17:39.466
What?

17:39.467 --> 17:41.367
Nothing.

17:44.568 --> 17:46.234
Are you pouting?

17:46.235 --> 17:48.836
What, you think
I just moved on with my life?

17:48.904 --> 17:50.037
Is that it?

17:50.038 --> 17:52.974
Well, I mean,
I disappeared, Fi.

17:53.041 --> 17:55.476
I come back, and you and Sam
are taking clients,

17:55.544 --> 17:57.444
Acting like
nothing ever happened.

17:57.512 --> 17:59.279
Oh!
Don't you dare say that!

17:59.280 --> 18:00.980
Don't you dare.

18:00.981 --> 18:03.483
Sam and I kicked in every door
we could think of.

18:03.550 --> 18:06.886
We took a client
out of respect for you.

18:06.953 --> 18:09.555
Because we knew that's what
you would have wanted.

18:11.124 --> 18:13.058
Well...

18:13.126 --> 18:14.392
Let's do this right.

18:14.393 --> 18:16.293
Welcome home.

18:20.364 --> 18:22.264
Oh, what happened to you?

18:23.433 --> 18:25.934
Knowing you, I don't know
if I should be more concerned

18:26.002 --> 18:28.436
About where you were
or why you're back.

18:28.504 --> 18:31.038
I guess saving management
earned me a little trust.

18:31.106 --> 18:32.439
I'm working on something.

18:32.440 --> 18:33.941
Whoever let Simon loose

18:33.942 --> 18:36.176
Is involved in something
much bigger -

18:36.243 --> 18:38.311
Some kind of international
war-for-profit scheme.

18:38.379 --> 18:39.845
I'm looking into it.

18:39.846 --> 18:41.580
I've seen firsthand
what I'm up against!

18:41.581 --> 18:42.982
One fight at a time, Fi!

18:42.983 --> 18:45.184
Hope you know
what you're doing.

18:45.251 --> 18:47.319
Go on up.
I'll get the charger.

18:58.029 --> 18:59.963
Sam: All right,
just slow down.

19:00.030 --> 19:01.697
We'll figure this out.
How?

19:01.698 --> 19:03.165
I gave the guy my life savings.

19:03.166 --> 19:04.332
He burned it on my lawn!

19:04.333 --> 19:05.967
Any rational human being
would at least -

19:05.968 --> 19:08.735
Did hunter seem like
a rational human being to you?

19:08.803 --> 19:11.470
No. No.
I guess not.

19:11.538 --> 19:13.772
Okay. Look, these are not
the type of folks

19:13.840 --> 19:15.306
That you can bargain with.

19:15.307 --> 19:17.007
You know, I'm starting
to get the feeling

19:17.008 --> 19:18.908
That maybe this
"looking for help" thing

19:18.909 --> 19:20.710
Was not such a good idea.

19:20.711 --> 19:22.511
Maybe I should -
I don't know -

19:22.512 --> 19:23.679
Just go to Mexico or something.

19:23.680 --> 19:25.580
That won't solve anything.

19:26.282 --> 19:28.417
Once you're green-lit,
you're green-lit.

19:28.485 --> 19:31.620
Every member of the gang is
supposed to kill you on sight.

19:31.688 --> 19:33.488
And if you're not around,
chances are,

19:33.489 --> 19:34.522
They'll find anyone
they can -

19:34.523 --> 19:37.158
A relative, friend...

19:37.226 --> 19:39.795
All I did was help this woman
get away from her boyfriend.

19:39.862 --> 19:41.429
What do we know
about the breakers?

19:41.430 --> 19:43.231
Well, aside from them
trying to kill Winston,

19:43.232 --> 19:44.432
Not a lot, you know.

19:44.433 --> 19:45.933
They've had their run-ins
with the law,

19:45.934 --> 19:47.568
But all I can get out
of my cop pals

19:47.569 --> 19:49.770
Is that they run an operation
out of a bar down in homestead.

19:49.837 --> 19:51.372
Boss is a guy named big ed.

19:51.373 --> 19:53.273
Apparently, he's quite large.

19:53.341 --> 19:55.375
We'll have to make a deal
with big ed

19:55.443 --> 19:56.643
To call hunter off.

19:56.644 --> 19:57.944
What are you talking about?

19:57.945 --> 19:58.945
What just said
we can't bargain with them.

19:58.946 --> 19:59.812
We can't bargain with hunter.

19:59.813 --> 20:01.113
Big ed runs the gang.

20:01.114 --> 20:03.114
He's the one who can turn off
the green light.

20:03.182 --> 20:04.582
Well, why would he do that?

20:04.583 --> 20:06.617
We'll have to make sure
that keeping you alive

20:06.685 --> 20:08.585
Is in the best interests
of the breakers.

20:08.653 --> 20:10.553
Ah. That easy, huh?

20:13.824 --> 20:15.724
Call Barry.

20:20.063 --> 20:22.198
See, the good thing
about a biker gang -

20:22.265 --> 20:23.666
An outlaw biker gang -

20:23.667 --> 20:25.334
Is that the club
owns everything.

20:25.335 --> 20:27.502
Members sign over
all their assets,

20:27.570 --> 20:29.504
Like a cult or a bad marriage.

20:29.572 --> 20:31.606
And this is
a good thing...Why?

20:31.674 --> 20:33.239
Well, it makes it easier

20:33.240 --> 20:36.308
To make it look like Winston
is mixed up with the gang.

20:36.375 --> 20:38.342
All we have to do is sign over
some of Winston's assets

20:38.410 --> 20:40.211
To the breakers -

20:40.212 --> 20:43.380
Make it look like he was running
guns for them or drugs.

20:43.448 --> 20:44.614
Go with gun running.

20:44.615 --> 20:46.515
Just enough so that
if they kill Winston,

20:46.583 --> 20:49.251
It'll be an opening for the FBI
to take the breakers down.

20:49.318 --> 20:50.251
What do you need?

20:50.252 --> 20:51.486
Their account numbers.

20:51.487 --> 20:53.221
I'm gonna work
a little Barry magic,

20:53.222 --> 20:55.657
Make it impossible for them
to tell where Winston begins

20:55.724 --> 20:57.258
And the breakers
motorcycle club ends.

20:57.259 --> 20:59.160
Well, according
to my cop buddies,

20:59.228 --> 21:01.662
The club's office is up on
the second floor above the bar,

21:01.730 --> 21:04.064
But it's crawling with bikers
and it's locked up tight.

21:04.132 --> 21:06.266
Only the top brass in the gang
has access.

21:06.334 --> 21:08.733
I guess we'll have to get
a little access of our own.

21:19.311 --> 21:21.646
Infiltrating
a hostile environment

21:21.713 --> 21:24.114
That reeks of testosterone
and motor oil is tough

21:24.181 --> 21:26.148
Unless you're
an attractive woman.

21:26.216 --> 21:28.751
The gender advantage
ends at the door, however.

21:28.818 --> 21:30.685
It's tough to pull off
surveillance

21:30.686 --> 21:32.320
When everyone
wants to talk to you.

21:32.321 --> 21:33.588
Hey.

21:33.589 --> 21:35.087
I ain't seen you around before.

21:35.088 --> 21:36.521
Well, I ain't
been around before.

21:36.522 --> 21:37.621
I just moved here,

21:37.622 --> 21:38.954
And I heard that the breakers

21:38.955 --> 21:40.656
Were the hardest crew around.

21:40.657 --> 21:42.557
Yeah, you heard right.

21:44.430 --> 21:46.631
I'm Earl. Nice to
have a friend, Earl.

21:46.699 --> 21:48.133
Is that who I think it is?

21:48.134 --> 21:50.034
Who, big ed?
Yeah.

21:50.102 --> 21:51.502
Want me to introduce you?

21:51.503 --> 21:53.304
No, that's okay, honey.

21:53.305 --> 21:56.173
I like to make my own
first impressions.

21:56.241 --> 21:58.675
But I will catch up
with you later.

21:58.742 --> 22:01.143
Promise.

22:01.211 --> 22:04.480
Surveillance isn't always
about learning secrets.

22:04.547 --> 22:07.416
Relationships are often
just as important.

22:07.483 --> 22:09.383
Hunter:
I'm telling you.

22:09.385 --> 22:12.354
He disrespected you.
He disrespected us.

22:12.421 --> 22:14.356
He should already
be dead by now.

22:14.424 --> 22:15.491
Big ed: I know.

22:15.492 --> 22:17.393
I'm working on it.

22:17.461 --> 22:19.462
The guy had some muscle
of his own.

22:19.530 --> 22:21.632
This dude was strapped.

22:21.699 --> 22:23.701
It's my job to protect
this club.

22:23.769 --> 22:25.236
We have a reputation.

22:25.237 --> 22:27.138
I don't care who he was
or what he was packing.

22:27.206 --> 22:28.907
The next guy that steps
between you and that lawyer

22:28.908 --> 22:30.808
Gets a bullet in the face.

22:32.873 --> 22:34.773
You understand?

23:19.307 --> 23:21.207
What the hell are you doing?!

23:25.178 --> 23:27.078
What do you think you're doing?

23:27.080 --> 23:28.180
Hey.

23:28.181 --> 23:29.615
You can't be in here.

23:29.616 --> 23:31.550
Oh, just finding us
someplace private

23:31.618 --> 23:33.752
Where we could be alone.
All right.

23:33.819 --> 23:35.553
You want to see what I brought
for us to play with?

23:35.554 --> 23:36.755
Oh, yeah.

23:36.756 --> 23:38.656
Uh-huh.

23:39.558 --> 23:41.459
Okay.

23:51.732 --> 23:54.433
Most digital cameras
aren't intended

23:54.501 --> 23:56.435
To take clear pictures
of documents.

23:56.503 --> 23:58.736
A handheld scanner,
on the other hand,

23:58.804 --> 24:00.704
Will prevent any contrast
or blurring problems.

24:08.977 --> 24:11.912
Earl! Earl!
You in there?!

24:17.182 --> 24:18.882
Earl!

24:18.883 --> 24:20.850
If you've got
a small-enough frame,

24:20.918 --> 24:22.952
An old-fashioned
ventilation system

24:23.019 --> 24:24.919
Can provide a decent
escape route.

24:26.323 --> 24:27.857
Earl! What the hell?

24:27.858 --> 24:29.758
What's going on, Earl?
Are you all right?

24:33.666 --> 24:36.601
And it'll keep bigger-boned
pursuers from following.

24:41.345 --> 24:43.844
I still don't understand
how it's gonna help.

24:43.845 --> 24:45.312
Okay, I want to get away
from these guys.

24:45.313 --> 24:46.813
Listen, man.
It's simple.

24:46.814 --> 24:49.415
Financially, we mix you up
with every nasty thing

24:49.483 --> 24:50.716
This gang is doing.

24:50.717 --> 24:52.217
That way,
if they take a shot at you,

24:52.218 --> 24:54.685
They're just inviting the FBI
to investigate the gang.

24:54.753 --> 24:55.886
I don't think
hunter's gonna care.

24:55.887 --> 24:57.454
The cops already -

24:57.455 --> 24:59.755
They don't care about a few of
their members getting arrested.

24:59.823 --> 25:00.990
But they'll feel differently

25:00.991 --> 25:02.592
About a massive
federal investigation

25:02.593 --> 25:04.028
Destroying
the breakers forever.

25:04.029 --> 25:04.928
What, you're just
gonna talk to 'em?

25:04.929 --> 25:06.296
Not exactly.

25:06.297 --> 25:08.097
We just need to get him
to where he's unprotected

25:08.098 --> 25:09.833
And talk some sense into him.

25:09.834 --> 25:11.501
Oh. "unprotected."
are you kidding me?!

25:11.502 --> 25:13.603
I went through all the mortgages
linked to the account.

25:13.671 --> 25:16.072
He's got a place up in Boca
where he stashes his girlfriend.

25:16.140 --> 25:17.440
You two deal
with the paperwork.

25:17.441 --> 25:19.341
We will deal with big ed.

25:21.778 --> 25:23.345
Yeah.

25:23.346 --> 25:24.579
Michael, it's Vaughn.

25:24.580 --> 25:26.213
I was wondering
if you could stop by.

25:26.214 --> 25:28.283
Got some news
you're gonna want to hear.

25:29.552 --> 25:31.651
Vaughn:
Drink, Michael?

25:31.719 --> 25:33.353
I'm good. Thanks.

25:33.354 --> 25:36.788
You were right on the money
about hart's government file.

25:36.856 --> 25:39.756
He was being investigated
by a counterintelligence group,

25:39.824 --> 25:41.525
With an annex
near a Miami military base.

25:41.526 --> 25:42.859
You'll need to get
into the system

25:42.860 --> 25:43.993
And find out what they have.

25:43.994 --> 25:46.194
Here's a ticket in.

25:46.262 --> 25:48.162
It should give you access
to everything you need.

25:48.163 --> 25:49.430
Don't push it.

25:49.431 --> 25:51.331
You have two minutes,
give or take.

25:51.333 --> 25:53.034
And remember,
if anything goes wrong,

25:53.035 --> 25:54.235
You're just a burned spy

25:54.236 --> 25:55.770
Caught with your hand
in the cookie jar.

25:55.771 --> 25:56.938
Are we done?

25:56.939 --> 25:57.872
I have some things
to take care of.

25:57.873 --> 25:59.106
Yeah, right.

25:59.107 --> 26:01.007
I heard you're mixing up
with a biker gang.

26:02.277 --> 26:04.678
All right, well,
get back to work, Robin hood.

26:04.746 --> 26:06.980
Don't get shot.

26:07.048 --> 26:09.149
We've got a lot of work to do.

26:16.557 --> 26:18.060
So this is big Ed's house, huh?

26:18.061 --> 26:19.664
I guess it pays to be the boss.

26:19.665 --> 26:21.333
This is big Ed's
girlfriend's house.

26:21.334 --> 26:23.034
He has another house
down in South Miami.

26:23.035 --> 26:24.368
I see.

26:24.369 --> 26:26.203
I'll take the front door.
You take the side.

26:26.204 --> 26:27.736
5 after, exactly.
You got it, Mikey.

26:27.737 --> 26:29.137
And remember,

26:29.138 --> 26:30.972
We just want to have a nice,
polite conversation with him

26:30.973 --> 26:31.906
After we kidnap him.

26:31.907 --> 26:33.240
Of course.

26:33.241 --> 26:35.141
Keep your head down.

26:39.613 --> 26:42.381
It's best to breach a building
from two directions.

26:44.150 --> 26:46.619
That way, your target has
to choose to defend the front

26:46.687 --> 26:48.254
Or the back.

26:48.255 --> 26:51.623
If you time it right,
both answers will be wrong.

26:51.691 --> 26:53.425
Nobody move!

26:53.426 --> 26:55.093
Darla:
What the hell?!

26:55.094 --> 26:57.828
Look, when I said nobody move,
I was talking to you, lady.

26:57.895 --> 26:59.095
Ed, what's going on?

26:59.096 --> 27:00.596
Just hold on a minute.

27:00.597 --> 27:02.497
Do you have any idea
who you're messing with?

27:02.500 --> 27:04.834
Nobody's messing with anyone.
We just want to talk.

27:04.901 --> 27:06.402
Talk, huh?

27:06.403 --> 27:08.437
Ed, this son of a bitch won't
get his shotgun out of my face!

27:08.504 --> 27:09.804
That's far enough, right there.

27:09.805 --> 27:11.138
I never hit a lady,
and I don't want to start.

27:11.139 --> 27:13.039
Now, back off!

27:22.615 --> 27:24.515
Ohh!

27:25.451 --> 27:27.418
It doesn't matter
how big someone is.

27:27.485 --> 27:29.587
There are certain points
on the human body

27:29.654 --> 27:30.721
That are vulnerable.

27:30.722 --> 27:32.622
Ohh!

27:34.625 --> 27:37.059
Pressure on the carotid artery
will knock someone out

27:37.127 --> 27:39.394
In 10 seconds,
no matter how big they are.

27:42.330 --> 27:44.731
Of course,
if they're big enough,

27:44.799 --> 27:47.033
It can be a pretty unpleasant
10 seconds.

28:03.082 --> 28:04.182
How's it going?

28:04.183 --> 28:05.584
Michael: Hey, Fi.

28:05.585 --> 28:08.454
Well, I won't be sleeping
on my back for a while,

28:08.521 --> 28:11.089
But we got big ed ready
for his conversation.

28:11.157 --> 28:12.957
Well, good luck with that.

28:12.958 --> 28:14.291
How's it going there?
Any movement?

28:14.292 --> 28:16.126
Nothing unusual, for now.

28:16.127 --> 28:18.561
Well, if they start
pulling guns and rolling out -

28:18.629 --> 28:20.062
Let you know
and get out of here.

28:20.063 --> 28:21.963
I got it.

28:22.765 --> 28:24.933
Darla: You sons of bitches!
You're all dead!

28:25.001 --> 28:26.534
Oh, yeah, we can hear you.

28:26.535 --> 28:28.703
Big ed: What the hell
do you people want?!

28:28.770 --> 28:30.504
Big ed,
I want you to meet Winston.

28:30.505 --> 28:32.372
Winston - you're the lawyer
that punked hunter, right?

28:32.373 --> 28:33.574
Something like that,

28:33.575 --> 28:35.275
And now hunter
wants to kill him for it.

28:35.276 --> 28:37.176
Yeah, I heard it was all over
a piece of tail, too.

28:37.211 --> 28:38.911
I helped her.
I would do it again.

28:38.912 --> 28:40.913
Well, I hope you're happy,
little man.

28:40.981 --> 28:42.515
'cause now
you're green-lit.

28:42.516 --> 28:43.715
And it ain't just hunter
after you.

28:43.716 --> 28:45.450
It's the whole club.

28:45.451 --> 28:47.351
It's about the honor
of the breakers.

28:48.087 --> 28:49.988
You want to put a bullet in me,
you go ahead.

28:50.056 --> 28:51.389
It won't make any difference.

28:51.390 --> 28:52.657
You're dead.

28:52.658 --> 28:54.192
Okay, let's say he's dead.

28:54.193 --> 28:56.361
Uh, could we not -
shut up.

28:56.428 --> 28:57.895
Let me explain to you

28:57.896 --> 29:00.831
What happens
the day Winston here dies.

29:00.899 --> 29:02.799
The feds will find
that he was involved

29:02.801 --> 29:04.669
With every single
financial transaction

29:04.670 --> 29:06.570
The breakers have done
in the past year.

29:06.638 --> 29:07.872
What are you talking about?

29:07.873 --> 29:08.906
I don't know this guy.

29:08.907 --> 29:10.908
Yeah?
Why's he driving your car?

29:10.976 --> 29:13.177
Says right here
you own his '98 Honda.

29:13.245 --> 29:15.646
I mean, hell,
he paid for your fillings.

29:15.714 --> 29:18.215
It says he's involved
in everything you do.

29:18.283 --> 29:20.551
And I'm sure the ATF would
be very interested to know

29:20.618 --> 29:21.985
How Winston here,

29:21.986 --> 29:24.288
Who on paper is
your most reliable gun runner,

29:24.355 --> 29:25.923
Ended up dead.

29:25.924 --> 29:27.791
Anything happens to Winston,

29:27.792 --> 29:30.729
It's gonna open the door
for a big-time investigation.

29:30.797 --> 29:32.697
Big ed,
you might be willing to die

29:32.732 --> 29:34.266
For the honor of the breakers.

29:34.267 --> 29:36.068
Tell me this -
where's the honor

29:36.069 --> 29:38.003
When every single chapter
of the breakers

29:38.071 --> 29:40.138
Will go down for conspiring
in this man's murder?

29:41.507 --> 29:42.974
It's your call.

29:42.975 --> 29:45.710
Destroy everything to kill a man
you've never met,

29:45.778 --> 29:49.080
Or call hunter off,
and you all continue to ride.

29:49.148 --> 29:50.948
Who are you?
Why are you doing this?

29:50.949 --> 29:52.849
I'm a man of honor,
just like you.

29:58.022 --> 29:59.922
Get me a phone.

30:07.830 --> 30:09.531
Hunter.

30:09.532 --> 30:10.798
Yeah, it's ed.

30:10.799 --> 30:13.600
Listen, meet me
at my old lady's house.

30:13.668 --> 30:15.268
Come alone.

30:15.269 --> 30:16.636
Hunter:
What's going on?

30:16.637 --> 30:18.071
I'm calling off the green light
on the lawyer.

30:18.072 --> 30:19.972
What?!

30:21.208 --> 30:23.076
Winston:
Okay, c-c-can't we just go?

30:23.077 --> 30:24.310
Not until it's over.

30:24.311 --> 30:25.813
We got to make sure
it's settled.

30:25.814 --> 30:28.817
Fi said hunter left the bar
about 20 minutes ago.

30:28.885 --> 30:30.318
He should be here.

30:30.319 --> 30:32.287
One of the most dangerous
times in war

30:32.355 --> 30:34.255
Is when peace
negotiations begin.

30:34.290 --> 30:36.791
Until both sides
agree on terms,

30:36.859 --> 30:38.759
You're sitting on a powder keg.

30:41.397 --> 30:45.266
You know negotiations
are off to a bad start

30:45.334 --> 30:48.402
When people can't even agree
on terms with their own side.

30:48.470 --> 30:50.071
Thought I told you
to come alone.

30:50.072 --> 30:53.941
Yeah, well, maybe you shouldn't
be giving orders anymore.

30:54.009 --> 30:55.375
Hunter, do you know
what you're saying?

30:55.376 --> 30:57.010
You've gone soft, old man.

30:57.011 --> 30:59.746
We're not letting
that little bitch Winston walk.

30:59.814 --> 31:02.449
You gave the green light
to take him out! Yeah.

31:02.516 --> 31:04.150
And now I'm turning it off.

31:04.151 --> 31:05.651
Uh, Mike, is this
how it's supposed to go?

31:05.652 --> 31:07.519
'cause I don't think this is
how it's supposed to go.

31:07.520 --> 31:09.188
What?
You said that -

31:09.189 --> 31:11.089
It's not an exact science.

31:11.124 --> 31:12.724
It's not worth it.

31:12.725 --> 31:14.359
Oh, it's worth it to me.

31:14.360 --> 31:16.895
It's not your call,

31:16.962 --> 31:18.196
So stand down.

31:18.197 --> 31:20.097
Or what?!

31:21.031 --> 31:22.931
Stand down or what?!

31:23.466 --> 31:25.366
Start the car, Sam.

31:26.736 --> 31:28.636
You're dead.
Pull a gun on me?

31:31.306 --> 31:33.206
All right, let's get in there.

31:43.550 --> 31:45.450
Open the door!

32:04.702 --> 32:06.069
What do we do now?

32:06.070 --> 32:07.203
Plan "b."

32:07.204 --> 32:08.237
What's plan "b"?!

32:08.238 --> 32:10.138
I'm...Working on it.

32:19.568 --> 32:21.468
Keep your head down!

32:30.043 --> 32:32.377
Losing blood! Put
pressure on the wound.

32:32.444 --> 32:34.278
No way hunter's
gonna back off now.

32:34.279 --> 32:35.545
He shot me.

32:35.546 --> 32:37.413
All he's got left
is to finish the job.

32:37.414 --> 32:39.048
Are the breakers with you,
or are they with him?

32:39.049 --> 32:40.216
They're with me.

32:40.217 --> 32:42.117
They're not here.
He is.

32:48.694 --> 32:49.927
Fi!

32:49.928 --> 32:51.428
I need you to get all
the breakers

32:51.429 --> 32:53.864
And head over
to Biscayne highway right now!

32:53.931 --> 32:55.632
Well, I thought you wanted me
to keep them away.

32:55.633 --> 32:57.434
Well, things have changed.

32:57.435 --> 32:58.701
All right.

32:58.702 --> 33:00.969
No need to raise
your voice at me.

33:17.218 --> 33:18.485
Hey, that's the chick!

33:18.486 --> 33:20.386
That's the chick that tased me!

33:21.521 --> 33:23.421
Come and get it, boys!

33:35.400 --> 33:39.504
Chasing a car with a motorcycle
is a tricky thing to pull off.

33:39.571 --> 33:40.738
Son of a bitch.

33:40.739 --> 33:42.239
The obvious thing to do

33:42.240 --> 33:44.241
Is shoot out the car's tires.

33:44.309 --> 33:46.209
Problem is,
it's a very difficult shot

33:46.277 --> 33:48.177
Unless you're alongside
the car.

33:48.979 --> 33:51.646
Unfortunately,
it's also pretty tough

33:51.714 --> 33:53.548
To hit a high-powered
motorcycle

33:53.549 --> 33:55.449
When you're in a swerving car
that's taking fire.

34:23.873 --> 34:24.973
I'm out of ammo.

34:24.974 --> 34:26.007
Where the hell is Fiona?

34:26.009 --> 34:27.909
She'll be here.

34:35.614 --> 34:37.916
Never been happier to see
that girl in my entire life.

34:37.984 --> 34:39.884
Hang on.

34:47.391 --> 34:49.292
Sam, I hope you have a plan.

34:49.293 --> 34:51.194
Yeah, kinda.

35:02.902 --> 35:06.069
Uh, Mike, not liking the
"surrounded by biker" thing.

35:06.137 --> 35:07.737
It's fine, Sam.

35:07.738 --> 35:09.238
We made a deal, right?

35:09.239 --> 35:10.339
Yeah.

35:10.340 --> 35:12.240
Fiona: Easy, boys.

35:15.312 --> 35:17.212
Man: It's ed!
Man #2: Hey, it's big ed!

35:17.248 --> 35:19.016
Stand down.

35:19.017 --> 35:21.452
Aah! Aah.

35:25.457 --> 35:27.357
You get out here.

35:30.193 --> 35:32.093
Get his cut.

35:38.165 --> 35:39.833
Everybody!

35:39.834 --> 35:41.734
Listen up.

35:44.507 --> 35:48.576
Anybody touches him,
anybody even looks at him funny,

35:48.643 --> 35:50.543
You get what
this guy gets here!

35:51.946 --> 35:54.146
If anybody has a problem
with that,

35:54.214 --> 35:56.114
Speak up now!

35:58.854 --> 36:00.388
You three.

36:00.389 --> 36:02.924
I don't know who you are
or where you came from,

36:02.992 --> 36:04.892
But I never want to see
your faces again.

36:06.061 --> 36:07.961
Right back at ya.
Sounds good.

36:09.997 --> 36:12.198
Get this son of a bitch
off the road!

36:21.473 --> 36:23.341
Nice ink.

36:23.342 --> 36:25.242
Thanks.

36:26.678 --> 36:28.712
Guess it makes me, uh,
untouchable or something?

36:30.114 --> 36:33.181
I just kind of wish
it wasn't so big.

36:33.249 --> 36:36.017
Ah. It's a small
price to pay. Yeah.

36:36.084 --> 36:38.185
Still don't know how I'm gonna
explain it to my mom.

36:38.252 --> 36:40.386
You can tell her it was that
or certain death.

36:40.454 --> 36:42.354
I'm sure she'll understand.

36:42.922 --> 36:46.225
Listen, um, I'm sorry
I doubted you guys there.

36:46.293 --> 36:47.527
And...

36:47.528 --> 36:49.662
You should keep
that guy Michael around.

36:49.730 --> 36:50.963
You make a great team.

36:50.964 --> 36:53.465
Thank you.

36:53.533 --> 36:55.467
Hey, have fun with that.

36:55.534 --> 36:57.434
Yeah.

36:58.303 --> 37:00.203
Ohh, God.

37:04.154 --> 37:07.071
As a spy, you don't have
to explain yourself much.

37:07.072 --> 37:10.540
You can disappear for a month,
and nobody asks questions.

37:10.541 --> 37:13.176
For a certain kind of person,
that's one of the perks

37:13.177 --> 37:15.078
Of going into
the intelligence business.

37:15.079 --> 37:18.281
As a civilian,
you don't have that luxury.

37:18.282 --> 37:20.984
Eventually, people expect
a good explanation

37:20.985 --> 37:22.218
When you disappear,

37:22.219 --> 37:24.119
Whether or not you have one.

37:25.889 --> 37:28.457
Hello, there, Michael.

37:28.458 --> 37:29.625
Hey, mom.

37:29.626 --> 37:32.894
To what do I owe the pleasure?

37:32.895 --> 37:35.029
Well, I thought we should talk.

37:36.264 --> 37:38.165
I know that, uh,

37:38.166 --> 37:42.301
It wasn't easy
while I was away.

37:42.302 --> 37:45.871
Having you gone is something
I've gotten used to.

37:45.872 --> 37:47.539
You know what was hard?

37:47.540 --> 37:49.908
Having an FBI Agent in my house

37:49.909 --> 37:52.376
Telling me that
you're a monster.

37:53.212 --> 37:55.113
I still don't know
what's going on.

37:55.114 --> 37:57.315
I was chasing
a man named Simon.

37:57.316 --> 38:00.884
He started off years ago
as someone who did what I did.

38:00.885 --> 38:03.887
Something happened,
he changed, and...

38:03.888 --> 38:05.254
He hurt people.

38:05.255 --> 38:08.557
And a lot of the things he did
got blamed on me.

38:08.558 --> 38:10.292
And how is that possible,
Michael?

38:10.293 --> 38:11.493
If you weren't there...

38:11.494 --> 38:14.830
I spent my entire career
officially being nowhere.

38:14.831 --> 38:17.666
So it's not hard
to pin things on someone

38:17.667 --> 38:20.235
Whose job
is to never have an alibi.

38:20.236 --> 38:22.203
Well, the other things
that he said.

38:22.204 --> 38:23.905
You blew up a bridge?

38:23.906 --> 38:25.507
You shot at police?

38:25.508 --> 38:27.075
You didn't do that?

38:27.076 --> 38:28.976
Yeah, I did.

38:30.012 --> 38:32.013
I had to get Simon.

38:32.014 --> 38:35.149
He was going to hurt more people
if I didn't stop him.

38:35.150 --> 38:38.586
So I broke the law.
I worked with bad people.

38:38.587 --> 38:40.654
I did it because I had to.

38:41.690 --> 38:43.157
That's it?

38:43.158 --> 38:44.792
It's as simple as that?

38:44.793 --> 38:47.395
I don't know.

38:49.464 --> 38:51.364
He laughed.

38:53.701 --> 38:56.469
When I caught Simon,
he laughed.

38:56.470 --> 38:58.738
He said
it was just a matter of time

38:58.739 --> 39:00.639
Before I was just like him.

39:06.079 --> 39:09.050
He's wrong, honey.

39:09.051 --> 39:11.686
That isn't the son I raised.

39:25.735 --> 39:27.469
So, you're going in there.

39:27.470 --> 39:29.670
Seriously, Michael, it's not
too late to change your mind.

39:29.671 --> 39:31.005
I need to do this, Fi.

39:31.006 --> 39:32.039
Because of Simon?

39:32.040 --> 39:33.676
You caught him.
It's over.

39:33.677 --> 39:34.944
It's not over.

39:34.945 --> 39:38.047
I need to find
whoever helped him get out.

39:38.048 --> 39:39.749
I saw the files, Fi.

39:39.750 --> 39:41.883
It's part of something bigger.
A lot of people are dying.

39:41.884 --> 39:43.251
And you have to stop it?

39:43.252 --> 39:46.154
I don't see anyone else
volunteering.

39:46.155 --> 39:47.655
Last I checked,

39:47.656 --> 39:49.524
I was the one sitting
in a getaway car

39:49.525 --> 39:51.659
Outside a secure
military facility

39:51.660 --> 39:53.828
That you were
about to sneak into.

39:53.829 --> 39:55.396
I may not like the idea,

39:55.397 --> 39:57.198
But I think I deserve
a little credit for showing up.

39:57.199 --> 39:59.099
Thank you.

40:00.035 --> 40:01.969
Thank you, Fi.

40:12.180 --> 40:17.051
Most military bases have a
civilian admin facility nearby.

40:18.186 --> 40:20.221
They're simple places -

40:20.222 --> 40:22.657
Just office buildings
filled with cubicles.

40:24.595 --> 40:28.899
Still, they're not places you
just want to walk into casually

40:28.900 --> 40:30.800
As a burned spy.

40:52.690 --> 40:54.123
How we doing out there, Fi?

40:54.124 --> 40:55.658
Well, no alarms
seem to be going off,

40:55.659 --> 40:57.092
If that's what you're asking.

40:57.093 --> 41:00.062
Are you almost done?

41:01.698 --> 41:03.166
Just downloading files now.

41:03.167 --> 41:04.735
Michael...Get out.

41:04.736 --> 41:06.636
Give me a sec.

41:16.345 --> 41:18.146
Okay, Fi, let's go.

41:18.147 --> 41:20.181
Fi, what are you doing?
Let's go.

41:20.182 --> 41:21.182
Uh-oh.

41:21.183 --> 41:23.017
What "uh-oh"?

41:23.018 --> 41:25.686
Fiona: Well,
you may have got out clean,

41:25.687 --> 41:27.355
But not everyone was so lucky.

41:27.356 --> 41:29.590
One of the problems
with stealing information

41:29.591 --> 41:31.726
Is that it's usually
someone else's job

41:31.727 --> 41:33.861
To keep that information safe.

41:33.862 --> 41:36.297
It doesn't matter
how clean your getaway is.

41:36.298 --> 41:38.933
There's always a chance
someone else will get blamed

41:38.934 --> 41:41.135
For what you did.

41:46.775 --> 41:48.275
How'd it go, Mike?

41:48.276 --> 41:51.111
You get what
you were looking for?

41:51.112 --> 41:53.313
Well, it's a start.

41:53.314 --> 41:54.815
Did you find out
anything about -

41:54.816 --> 41:56.216
About your fall guy?

41:56.217 --> 41:58.151
Yeah.
I made some calls.

41:58.152 --> 42:00.020
Turns out,
you were accessing the files

42:00.021 --> 42:03.223
Of a counterintelligence Agent
named Jesse Porter.

42:03.224 --> 42:04.291
He's in federal custody.

42:04.292 --> 42:05.759
Are they prosecuting?

42:05.760 --> 42:07.260
Doesn't seem like it.

42:07.261 --> 42:09.296
They'd have to declassify
the files.

42:10.364 --> 42:12.264
They're gonna blacklist
the guy.

42:15.102 --> 42:17.537
Mike, you just burned a spy.
