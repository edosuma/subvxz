THAT SHOULD BE
YOUR COMPANY MOTTO.

16:44.337 --> 16:47.138
[ SIGHS ]

16:47.140 --> 16:48.339
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE,
MIKE?

16:48.341 --> 16:50.341
I JUST STOPPED BY...

16:50.343 --> 16:51.342
[ CAR DOOR CLOSES ]

16:51.344 --> 16:52.777
...TO SEE
IF EVERYTHING WAS OKAY.

16:52.779 --> 16:55.346
[ SIGHS ] EVERYTHING'S FINE.
IT WAS A FALSE ALARM.

16:55.348 --> 16:58.483
DECIDED TO RELIEVE MY GUY
FOR A FEW HOURS.

16:58.485 --> 17:01.853
LET HIM GO HOME
AND FEED HIS SEEING-EYE DOG?

17:01.855 --> 17:04.455
MM.
HOW WAS JAMES TAYLOR?

17:04.457 --> 17:07.458
IT WAS A GREAT CONCERT, AND
I'M SORRY THAT YOU MISSED IT.

17:07.460 --> 17:08.626
YOU KNOW, HE SANG
"YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND" AND...

17:08.628 --> 17:09.660
OH, GREAT SONG.

17:09.662 --> 17:11.062
...VANESSA AND CAROL
BURST INTO TEARS,

17:11.064 --> 17:12.296
STARTED
HUGGING EACH OTHER.
HMM.

17:12.298 --> 17:14.866
IT WAS --
IT WAS HARD TO WATCH.

17:14.868 --> 17:16.667
THAT'S ALL IT TOOK
TO PATCH THINGS UP?

17:16.669 --> 17:20.471
WELL, A LITTLE CONTACT HIGH
FROM THE HIPPIES IN FRONT OF US.

17:20.473 --> 17:24.042
THEY DECIDED THAT IT WAS A BAD
IDEA FOR THEM TO WORK TOGETHER.

17:24.044 --> 17:26.577
YOU KNOW, WOMEN JUST HAVE
A TOUGH TIME COMPARTMENTALIZING.

17:26.579 --> 17:28.813
YEAH...WELL, MAYBE
IT'S NOT JUST WOMEN.

17:28.815 --> 17:30.415
YOU KNOW,
I'VE BEEN HAVING A HARD TIME

17:30.417 --> 17:32.583
WORKING WITH
MY GOOD FRIEND...

17:32.585 --> 17:33.583

17:35.254 --> 17:39.057
AND, UH, WORKING WITH YOU HASN'T
BEEN ALL THAT EASY, EITHER.

17:39.059 --> 17:43.528
YEAH. YOU'RE RIGHT.
MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T DO THIS.

17:43.530 --> 17:45.163
WHAT?!
YOU'RE GONNA FIRE A BROTHER

17:45.165 --> 17:47.365
AFTER HE MISSED JAMES TAYLOR
FOR YOU?

17:47.367 --> 17:49.734
NO, I'M NOT GONNA FIRE YOU.
I'M NOT A MONSTER.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.803
LET'S JUST STOP
BEING FRIENDS.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.574
OH,
THAT'S A BETTER IDEA.

17:56.576 --> 17:57.742
YEAH, WE'RE --
WE'RE STILL NEIGHBORS.

17:57.744 --> 17:59.577
YEAH, THAT'S MUCH BETTER.
OF COURSE.
YEAH, YEAH.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.746
WE'LL STILL DO THINGS TOGETHER
WHEN THE WOMEN FORCE US TO.

18:01.748 --> 18:04.615
YEAH. OKAY.
UM, JUST FOR THEIR SAKE.

18:04.617 --> 18:05.616
EXACTLY.

18:05.618 --> 18:07.118
AND I SUPPOSE
IT WOULD BE OKAY

18:07.120 --> 18:08.753
IF YOU CAME OVER TOMORROW
AND WATCHED THE NUGGETS GAME.

18:08.755 --> 18:11.456
ALREADY ON THE BOOKS.
YEAH.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.458
OKAY, FROM NOW ON,
WE'RE JUST A COUPLE OF GUYS

18:13.460 --> 18:16.461
WHO WORK TOGETHER,
LIVE IN CLOSE PROXIMITY,

18:16.463 --> 18:20.231
AND, UM,
SOMETIMES DO STUFF TOGETHER.

18:20.233 --> 18:22.233
MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T TRY
TO LABEL IT.

18:22.235 --> 18:24.035
MM.

18:26.738 --> 18:30.141
HI, THERE. MIKE BAXTER HERE
FOR OUTDOOR MAN.

18:30.143 --> 18:32.577
YOU KNOW, A GROUP OF LIONS
IS CALLED A "PRIDE,"

18:32.579 --> 18:35.546
BUT IS A LION ACTUALLY PROUD?
IT HAS EVERY RIGHT TO BE.

18:35.548 --> 18:37.582
IT'S THE TOP
OF THE AFRICAN FOOD CHAIN.

18:37.584 --> 18:39.150
BUT WHEN A LION MAKES A KILL,

18:39.152 --> 18:41.152
DOES IT DO
AN OBNOXIOUS VICTORY DANCE

18:41.154 --> 18:43.955
AND THEN SPIKE THE ANTELOPE?
NO.

18:43.957 --> 18:46.157
LIONS KEEP IT CLASSY.

18:46.159 --> 18:48.559
THEY EAT, LICK THEIR PAWS,
DO A FEW CIRCLES,

18:48.561 --> 18:51.762
AND GO DO THEIR BUSINESS
IN THE TALL GRASS.

18:51.764 --> 18:54.565
NOW, THE ANCIENT GREEKS
HAD A WORD FOR SHOWBOATING.

18:54.567 --> 18:55.565
IT'S CALLED "HUBRIS."

18:55.567 --> 18:58.903
IT MEANS EXCESSIVE PRIDE
LEADING TO ONE'S OWN DOWNFALL.

18:58.905 --> 19:00.738
THE WORD IS SO ANCIENT,
IT COMES FROM WHEN

19:00.740 --> 19:02.507
THE GREEKS ACTUALLY
HAD A LOT TO BE PROUD OF,

19:02.509 --> 19:05.610
BACK WHEN THEY CREATED
DEMOCRACY, THE OLYMPICS.

19:05.612 --> 19:10.681
NOW THEY LIGHT CHEESE ON FIRE
AND OWE THE GERMANS BILLIONS.

19:10.683 --> 19:14.118
HERE'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE
OF THE PRICE YOU PAY FOR HUBRIS.

19:14.120 --> 19:16.120
[ Chuckling ]
AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT
THE HANDSOME DUDE IN THE D-CUPS.

19:16.122 --> 19:17.989
I'M TALKING ABOUT
THE LITTLE VICTORY DANCE

19:17.991 --> 19:22.193
DOWN IN THE CORNER --
"ZUGGZ."

19:22.195 --> 19:23.427
THE DUMBASS TAGGERS
COULDN'T RESIST

19:23.429 --> 19:24.996
TAKING CREDIT
FOR THEIR HANDIWORK,

19:24.998 --> 19:27.431
WHICH ALLOWED OUR SECURITY GUY,
CHUCK LARABEE,

19:27.433 --> 19:29.000
TO TRACK DOWN
THESE MASTER CRIMINALS

19:29.002 --> 19:31.602
TO THEIR MOM'S BASEMENT
IN THORNTON.

19:31.604 --> 19:34.639
THOSE TWO ZUGGZ WILL BE SPENDING
THE REST OF THE EIGHTH GRADE

19:34.641 --> 19:36.641
PICKING UP TRASH ALONG I-25.

19:36.643 --> 19:37.641
WAVE AT THEM.

19:37.643 --> 19:39.443
AND LIKE THE LIONS,
THEY'LL PROBABLY HAVE TO

19:39.445 --> 19:43.514
DO THEIR BUSINESS...
IN THE TALL GRASS.

19:51.723 --> 19:54.725
OH, WASHING
YOUR CLOTHES, HUH?

19:54.727 --> 19:57.361
BETTER HOPE NONE OF
YOUR DESIGNER LABELS CAME OFF,

19:57.363 --> 19:59.697
OR YOU'RE HOLDING A BASKET
OF CHEAP CHINESE RAGS.

19:59.699 --> 20:04.068
ACTUALLY, I'VE DONE LAUNDRY
FOR THE ENTIRE FAMILY,

20:04.070 --> 20:05.670
AND I WON'T BE TAKING
ANY CREDIT.

20:05.672 --> 20:09.340
I WILL, HOWEVER, BE TAKING
THE 85 CENTS THAT I FOUND.

20:09.342 --> 20:10.975
HEY, GIRLS.

20:10.977 --> 20:12.376
HI.
HEY, MOM.

20:12.378 --> 20:16.881
OH, WOW. EVIE, LOOK --
YOU DID ALL THE LAUNDRY, TOO?

20:18.751 --> 20:20.017

20:20.019 --> 20:22.853
THANKS, MOM, BUT I'M REALLY
NOT LOOKING FOR CREDIT.

20:22.855 --> 20:24.722
IT -- IT JUST
WOULDN'T BE RIGHT.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.891
NO, IT WOULDN'T.
IT JUST WOULDN'T.

20:26.893 --> 20:27.892
[ CHUCKLES ]

20:27.894 --> 20:29.894
YEAH, BUT WE ALL KNOW
WHO DID IT --

20:29.896 --> 20:32.697
THE SAME ANGEL WHO CLEANED
THE WHOLE KITCHEN THE OTHER DAY.
YEAH.

20:32.699 --> 20:35.266
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE NOT
ONLY YOUR DAD'S FAVORITE.

20:35.268 --> 20:36.901
WHAT I MEAN IS...

20:36.903 --> 20:38.502
you're also mine.
Yeah.

20:38.504 --> 20:40.004
[ SMOOCHES ]

20:40.006 --> 20:42.273
Got to work
on your whispering, Mom.

20:42.275 --> 20:45.109
OH. [ Chuckling ] SORRY.
I DIDN'T MEAN THAT.

20:45.111 --> 20:46.344
OKAY.
[ SMOOCHES ]

20:46.346 --> 20:47.278
I really did.

20:47.280 --> 20:49.080
Yeah. Okay. Bye.

20:49.082 --> 20:50.514
WOW.

20:50.516 --> 20:53.084

OH, MY GOD.

[ Chuckling ] YOU SHRUNK MOM'S
NEW JAMES TAYLOR SHIRT.

20:59.225 --> 21:02.360
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT WAS IN THERE.
SHE LOVES THAT THING.

21:02.362 --> 21:03.794

DO THE LAUNDRY, SO --

21:11.371 --> 21:13.404
OH. OKAY.
GO TRY TELLING MOM THAT.

21:13.406 --> 21:15.406

OF SOMETHING ELSE, ACTUALLY,
