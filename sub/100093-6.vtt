that have no direct knowledge

- Too loaded.

Maybe if you'd learn
how to ask a proper question,

09:19.101 --> 09:21.061
- we'd be done by now.
- This is exhausting.

09:21.103 --> 09:22.312
- I can't.
- Well, if you're exhausted,

09:50.424 --> 09:52.134
Yes.

there, but I love this idea.

- Yes.

- And I know how we're gonna get there.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.418

Big Sur? Why not Sacramento?

10:29.004 --> 10:31.089
Better view?

10:31.131 --> 10:33.633
Or away from the prying eyes
of the state government, maybe?

10:33.675 --> 10:36.386
Or maybe it was 'cause it was
halfway between us and them.

10:36.428 --> 10:38.221
You think
that's what they were thinking?

10:38.263 --> 10:40.599
If the state was diverting
the ranchers' water

10:40.640 --> 10:43.435
during this drought to the
residents of Los Angeles County,

10:43.477 --> 10:45.812
wouldn't they need the
Metropolitan Water District

10:45.854 --> 10:49.608
of Southern California
in on any negotiations?

10:49.649 --> 10:51.610
Wow, that's way
above my pay grade.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.403
Well, you didn't
answer the question.

10:53.445 --> 10:56.948
Well, all I know is that
our contract is with the state.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.076
Well, wouldn't any deal with
the Blackwood County water bank

10:59.117 --> 11:00.327
and the state of California

11:00.369 --> 11:01.787
need L.A. Metro's approval?

11:01.828 --> 11:04.456
You will have to get
L.A. Metro on board.

11:04.498 --> 11:06.291
Done, dude.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.585
How?

11:10.003 --> 11:12.589
My lucky charm.

I suggest you depose them instead.

that L.A. has its own contract

I am. Yeah.

I knew about it.

11:55.632 --> 11:57.759
Well, see, that's the problem.
You are the public.

11:57.801 --> 12:00.971
And you effectively privatized
a public resource

12:01.012 --> 12:02.389

12:07.185 --> 12:08.687
Well, I bet the people
in Blackwood County

12:08.728 --> 12:10.480
who don't have any water
might see it that way.

12:10.522 --> 12:13.066

to me about it.

find out that their water's

12:20.574 --> 12:22.492

BILLY: Who decided to cut the
Blackwood County residents'

13:19.633 --> 13:21.009
water off in favor
of the farmers?

13:21.051 --> 13:23.595
- No one.
- Hmm.

13:23.637 --> 13:25.388
Isn't it the Blackwood County
Water Board's job

13:25.430 --> 13:27.140
to decide how much water
is apportioned

13:27.182 --> 13:28.558
to residential
and commercial use?

13:28.600 --> 13:29.893
Yes.

13:29.935 --> 13:31.978
So this decision was made
by no one,

13:32.020 --> 13:33.396
and yet somehow it happened.

13:33.438 --> 13:36.566
No one cut off
the residents' water.

13:36.608 --> 13:38.693
The residents ran out
of their allotment,

13:38.735 --> 13:41.446
and the board decided
not to extend their allotment.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.823
In fact, the board
even warned the residents

13:43.865 --> 13:46.076
not to be wasteful
during a drought.

13:46.117 --> 13:48.870
Now, what the residents did
with their allotment of water

13:48.912 --> 13:50.455
was not under our control,

13:50.497 --> 13:53.083
and that is standard procedure.

13:53.124 --> 13:55.210
(SCOFFS)
That was good.

13:55.252 --> 13:57.671
That's your best answer yet.
Did you write that for him?

Please direct your questions
to the deposed.

13:59.756 --> 14:01.091
Yes, ma'am.

14:01.132 --> 14:04.636
So, if this Big Sur meeting
was about the renegotiation

14:04.678 --> 14:06.346
of a public contract,
why the NDAs?

14:06.388 --> 14:08.139
What NDAs?

14:08.181 --> 14:09.933
The ones you told me about.

14:09.975 --> 14:12.310
Oh, you remembered that?

14:12.352 --> 14:15.397
(EXHALES) I guess I'm not
as smart as I thought.

14:15.438 --> 14:16.982
Okay, I'll ask
the question again.

14:17.023 --> 14:18.149
Why the NDAs?

14:18.191 --> 14:19.859
What are the NDAs
keeping so secret?

14:19.901 --> 14:21.736
No need to answer that.

14:21.778 --> 14:24.406
Mr. McBride, you know the point
of the NDA is not to disclose

14:24.447 --> 14:25.740
information they're protecting.

14:25.782 --> 14:29.369
And "secret" is
a very childish word.

14:29.411 --> 14:31.329
We're adults.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.583
- Can't hurt to ask.
- Well, hey,

you got lucky once.

14:36.835 --> 14:38.211
Hmm?

14:38.253 --> 14:39.629
So, here's a question.

14:39.671 --> 14:41.423
Who holds the privilege
to the NDAs?

14:41.464 --> 14:44.968
I believe that the Central
Valley Tallgrass Farming Company

14:45.010 --> 14:46.428
holds that privilege.

14:46.469 --> 14:48.471
Tallgrass Farming Company,
which is you.

14:48.513 --> 14:50.974
Indeed. I guess I am
smarter than I thought.

14:51.016 --> 14:52.642
Mm.

14:52.684 --> 14:54.603
Okay, so, since you hold
the privilege,

14:54.644 --> 14:56.062
you can tell me anything
you want to tell me.

14:56.104 --> 14:58.440
- Yes. That's how it works.
- Right.

14:58.481 --> 15:00.191
So, what do you want to tell me?

15:00.233 --> 15:02.068
As little as legally possible.

No?

32:03.422 --> 32:05.132
Well,
I was under immense pressure

32:05.174 --> 32:08.093
from opposing counsel
at the time.

32:08.135 --> 32:11.096
I testified as I was told to.

32:11.138 --> 32:13.265
So you're saying you didn't
blackmail the cop,

32:13.307 --> 32:16.101
but you committed
perjury instead?

32:17.561 --> 32:19.855
But I... See, I'm just...
I'm not sure that,

32:19.897 --> 32:21.482
that...

32:21.523 --> 32:22.775
the details of the situation

32:22.816 --> 32:24.485
actually legally
amounted to blackmail.

32:24.526 --> 32:28.322
See... uh... I mean, you-you'd
have to ask Mr. McBride.

32:28.364 --> 32:30.616
We would, but we can't, can we?

32:32.660 --> 32:34.411
Yeah.

32:34.453 --> 32:36.580
(SIGHS)

32:36.622 --> 32:38.207
It's a shame Mr. McBride
couldn't be here

32:38.248 --> 32:39.625
to speak on your behalf.

32:39.667 --> 32:41.752
I mean, he's just been
in depositions all day.

32:41.794 --> 32:43.879
I'm sure he's just running late.

32:43.921 --> 32:45.297
O'SHEA: What happened
during the course

32:45.339 --> 32:47.758
of the Borns Tech trial goes
directly to the heart

32:47.800 --> 32:49.635
of what you would be like
as an attorney.

32:49.677 --> 32:52.346
It involves how you dealt
with a witness

32:52.388 --> 32:54.682
during the course of a case.

32:56.725 --> 32:59.228
Did you have sex with
a police officer and film it

32:59.269 --> 33:01.730
for the sole purpose
of using it against him?

33:03.774 --> 33:05.442
Yes.

33:05.484 --> 33:07.277
Thank you, Ms. Gold.
That'll be all.

33:07.319 --> 33:08.696
We'll let you know our decision.

33:08.737 --> 33:09.988
- BILLY: No, hang on just a sec.
- That's it?

33:10.030 --> 33:12.074
- Yes, that's it.
- BILLY: Uh, hang on.

33:12.116 --> 33:16.245
I-I'm sorry. I-I had
a deposition go really late.

33:16.286 --> 33:17.955
- The hearing's closed, Mr. McBride.
- No, I understand that,

33:17.996 --> 33:19.873
but, look, just give me
a second, will you?

33:19.915 --> 33:22.084
This woman deserves
your full attention

33:22.126 --> 33:23.836
and every consideration.

33:23.877 --> 33:26.588
We gave her full consideration
for the full 60 minutes.

33:26.630 --> 33:29.383
You guys, there's no law that
says you got to get out of here

33:29.425 --> 33:31.051
right now. You know that.
Hey, how are you?

33:31.093 --> 33:32.386
- Hi.
- Billy McBride. What's your name?

33:32.428 --> 33:33.595
- Ms. Kwok.
- Okay.

33:33.637 --> 33:34.805
Hi. How you doing? Pleasure.

33:34.847 --> 33:36.640
Have you had a few to drink
today, Mr. McBride?

33:36.682 --> 33:39.601
That's none of your business.
That's not what this is about.

33:39.643 --> 33:42.146
This woman right here,
all the things

33:42.187 --> 33:44.314
that I'm sure you're concerned
about, like her record,

33:44.356 --> 33:48.193
are the very things that would
make her a great attorney

33:48.235 --> 33:51.280
because she's been
on the other side, okay?

33:51.321 --> 33:53.532
Sh-She knows what it's like.
I mean, ordinarily,

33:53.574 --> 33:56.493
I-I don't hire defendants...
to work for me.

33:56.535 --> 33:58.829
There's a reason I did.

33:58.871 --> 34:02.332
Because she has experience,
she has empathy, perseverance,

34:02.374 --> 34:05.961
all these things they don't
teach you in law school.

34:06.003 --> 34:08.130
All the intangibles.

34:08.172 --> 34:10.966
I mean, can't we use more humans
in our trade, don't you think?

34:11.007 --> 34:12.967
And I-I've seen her...

34:13.010 --> 34:15.094
I mean, she's stuck with me
through thick and thin.

34:15.137 --> 34:17.473
So, I mean,

34:17.514 --> 34:19.975
can't we kind of loosen up
and not make this some kind of

34:20.016 --> 34:22.101
boardroom meeting,
and-and just be people

34:22.143 --> 34:23.353
with each other for a minute?

34:23.395 --> 34:25.773
We'll let you know.

34:25.813 --> 34:27.274
That's it? "We'll let you know"?

34:27.315 --> 34:29.610
- We're done.
- Come on.

34:38.534 --> 34:40.788
Thank you.

34:40.829 --> 34:44.373
- Hey, honey. Listen, I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine.

34:44.416 --> 34:45.626
The deposition
really did go long.

34:45.667 --> 34:47.795
It's fine. You did a great job,
you did a great speech.

34:47.835 --> 34:49.880
- Thanks, Billy.
- I wasn't just fucking around.
