Boy, what a great day
for a baseball game.

00:37.371 --> 00:38.737
Yeah, and these
are the best seats

00:38.739 --> 00:40.572
in the house
for catching home run balls.

00:40.574 --> 00:41.907
Aw, that'd be sweet.

00:41.909 --> 00:44.776
The only souvenir I ever got was
at that stock car race.

00:51.717 --> 00:53.718
All right,
I got the guy!

00:53.720 --> 00:54.986
I got the guy.

00:57.490 --> 00:58.890
Man, I hate
the Yankees.

00:58.892 --> 01:00.892
Yeah! You are all villains
to me

01:00.894 --> 01:04.496
because I happen to live in this
region of the country. Yeah!

01:04.498 --> 01:05.497
(crowd cheering)

01:05.499 --> 01:07.499
What's going on?
Did I miss something?

01:07.501 --> 01:09.668
Nah, just some idiot streaking
across the field.

01:09.670 --> 01:13.004
Ha ha. You're all looking
at my penis.

01:13.006 --> 01:16.441
You didn't plan on it,
but it's happening.

01:16.443 --> 01:19.110
Oh, cool. Two
spots opened up.

01:19.112 --> 01:21.079
You, uh-- y-you go ahead.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.248
I can wait. I might--
I might wait for a stall.

01:23.250 --> 01:24.683
Oh, come on, Peter.

01:24.685 --> 01:26.785
We're missing the game.

01:26.787 --> 01:28.587
(unzipping)

01:28.589 --> 01:29.588
Hey. Hi.

01:29.590 --> 01:30.789
Hey.

01:30.791 --> 01:32.791
PETER: <i>Damn it.</i>
<i>He already started.</i>

01:32.793 --> 01:35.427
<i>If I don't start peeing soon,</i>
<i>it's gonna be weird.</i>

01:35.429 --> 01:37.429
<i>He'll be all done,</i>
<i>and I'll still be here.</i>

01:37.431 --> 01:38.530
<i>Come on, Peter. Pee.</i>

01:38.532 --> 01:40.098
<i>Your dad fought</i>
<i>in World War II,</i>

01:40.100 --> 01:41.933
<i>and you can't even pee</i>
<i>in a urinal?</i>

01:41.935 --> 01:43.301
<i>What the hell's</i>
<i>wrong with you?</i>

01:43.303 --> 01:44.636
All set?
Yup.

01:44.638 --> 01:45.604
(zipping)

01:45.606 --> 01:46.771
I know you didn't go.

01:46.773 --> 01:49.541
I'm'a go pee
in a stairwell.

01:49.543 --> 01:51.810
STADIUM ANNOUNCER: Now batting
for the Red Sox,

01:51.812 --> 01:54.279
number 34, David Ortiz.

01:54.281 --> 01:55.814
Come on, Big Papi!

01:55.816 --> 01:57.616
(crack of bat, crowd cheering)

01:57.618 --> 01:58.984
It's coming straight for us!

01:58.986 --> 02:00.885
I got it, I got it!

02:01.787 --> 02:03.622
Mine! I got it!
It's my ball

02:03.624 --> 02:05.390
Damn it, Brian!
That came to me!

02:05.392 --> 02:07.125
That's my ball!

02:07.127 --> 02:08.627
(wind whistling)
What?

02:08.629 --> 02:10.128
Holy crap!

02:10.130 --> 02:12.564
(crowd murmuring)
(gasps)

02:13.966 --> 02:16.134
(crowd laughing hysterically)

02:16.136 --> 02:19.971
(slowly increasing
horrified scream)

02:19.973 --> 02:21.806
Wow, I guess
all this time,

02:21.808 --> 02:23.808
Quagmire should've
been saying "wiggity."

02:23.810 --> 02:25.977
Ha!
No, but he's
our friend.

02:29.982 --> 02:31.416
TV ANNOUNCER: <i>And now it's time</i>

02:31.418 --> 02:32.817
<i>for</i>
<i>the</i> Channel Five Sports Report

02:32.819 --> 02:34.185
<i>brought to you by Kia.</i>

02:34.187 --> 02:36.154
<i>Kia: Too bad it's a Kia.</i>

02:36.156 --> 02:37.822
A big day at Fenway today,

02:37.824 --> 02:40.158
as the Red Sox bested
the Yankees seven to six.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.993
But what really
has everyone talking

02:41.995 --> 02:44.496
is the fan who lost his toupee
at the game.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.031
The hilarious video already has

02:46.033 --> 02:48.166
over two million views
on YouTube.

02:48.168 --> 02:51.202
Comments ranged from sympathy
all the way to racial slurs

02:51.204 --> 02:53.004
directed at others
who chose to comment.

02:53.006 --> 02:55.173
Great, I'm a
laughingstock.

02:55.175 --> 02:56.174
What do I do?

02:56.176 --> 02:57.842
Come on, Quagmire.
It's not so bad.

02:57.844 --> 02:59.377
You could kill yourself.

02:59.379 --> 03:01.012
Well, it's just a thought,

03:01.014 --> 03:03.381
but have you ever considered
just embracing your baldness?

03:03.383 --> 03:04.849
Yeah, Brian's right.

03:04.851 --> 03:06.851
You know, there's lots of
big Hollywood celebrities

03:06.853 --> 03:08.687
who have gone bald with dignity.

03:08.689 --> 03:11.556
John Travolta, David Spade,
Nicolas Cage, Jeremy Piven...

03:11.558 --> 03:13.024
And besides,
don't you think

03:13.026 --> 03:15.026
you'll be happier just
being who you really are?

03:15.028 --> 03:16.961
(sighing): Maybe you're
right. What the hell.

03:16.963 --> 03:19.030
I mean, wh-what other choice do
I have at this point?

03:19.032 --> 03:20.532
Everybody knows
now anyway.

03:20.534 --> 03:21.533
Great.
Trust me.

03:21.535 --> 03:23.201
Nobody's gonna give
you a hard time.

03:23.203 --> 03:24.869
And even if they do,
just ignore them.

03:24.871 --> 03:26.871
That's what I do
with that weekend bully.

03:26.873 --> 03:28.873
Hey, your weekend sucks!

03:28.875 --> 03:30.542
I've already
gone on a hike

03:30.544 --> 03:32.877
and fixed a few things
around my house!

03:32.879 --> 03:34.045
What are you doing?!

03:34.047 --> 03:35.213
Peter, who is that man?

03:35.215 --> 03:36.815
I don't want to talk
about it.

03:39.585 --> 03:42.721
Dad, there's a weird bald guy
out in front of our house.

03:42.723 --> 03:43.888
Ah, that's just Quagmire.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.990
He's acting all different
now that he's bald.

03:45.992 --> 03:47.058
I'll go talk to him.

03:48.060 --> 03:49.661
Hey, slow down!

03:49.663 --> 03:51.229
Drive like hell,
you'll get there!

03:51.231 --> 03:52.997
Quagmire, what the
hell are you doing?

03:52.999 --> 03:54.999
I'm just letting
all these hot-rodders know

03:55.001 --> 03:57.836
that this is a neighborhood,
not a speedway track.

03:57.838 --> 03:59.003
Too fast, too fast!

03:59.005 --> 04:01.239
Our children should not have
to live in fear!

04:01.241 --> 04:03.007
Okay, well, how come
you're not doing this

04:03.009 --> 04:04.576
in front of your own house?

04:04.578 --> 04:06.578
Oh, my ham radio interferes
with the radar gun.

04:06.580 --> 04:08.747
Talked to a fella in Papua
New Guinea last night.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.949
You should come by sometime
and join in the fun.

04:10.951 --> 04:12.584
VOICE ON RADIO: Hello?

04:12.586 --> 04:13.952
H-Hello?

04:13.954 --> 04:15.754
Are you bald?
(static crackles)

04:15.756 --> 04:16.988
Yeah.

04:20.760 --> 04:21.760
Can I help you?

04:21.762 --> 04:23.294
Well, I hope you can, Sharon.

04:23.296 --> 04:26.297
I'd just like to return this
VHS copy of <i>Pete's Dragon.</i>

04:26.299 --> 04:29.300
Watched, enjoyed
and rewound.

04:29.302 --> 04:31.302
Uh, there are a lot
of people waiting.

04:31.304 --> 04:32.871
Is there anything else?

04:32.873 --> 04:34.939
Uh, yes. Do you have
a garbage can back there?

04:34.941 --> 04:38.209
I have the backings
to some Fruit Roll-Ups
I need to discard.

04:38.211 --> 04:40.445
I'm sorry. That's for
library trash only.

04:40.447 --> 04:42.046
I understand.
That's okay.

04:42.048 --> 04:44.449
I'll just hold on to these
for the rest of the day.

04:44.451 --> 04:46.451
It ain't easy
bein' green, huh?
(weak chuckle)

04:46.453 --> 04:47.886
That's from a song.

04:47.888 --> 04:48.887
Is that all?

04:48.889 --> 04:50.655
Yeah. Is there
an age restriction

04:50.657 --> 04:52.824
for the sleight-of-hand
magic show this afternoon?

04:52.826 --> 04:54.626
Twelve.
Ooh.

04:54.628 --> 04:57.061
Maybe I'll just stand
in the hallway and look in.

04:57.063 --> 04:59.898
Now, we all saw you put
your card back in the deck.

04:59.900 --> 05:02.967
So, how did it end up...
in your shirt pocket?

05:02.969 --> 05:06.905
Oh, my God,
how did he
do that?

05:09.809 --> 05:12.076
Oh, no, there's Quagmire.

05:13.312 --> 05:14.846
He's been so
weird lately.

05:14.848 --> 05:16.347
You notice now
that he's bald,

05:16.349 --> 05:18.817
whenever he thinks
about something, he
scratches his wrist?

05:18.819 --> 05:20.652
Hey, Quagmire,
we got a pitcher.

05:20.654 --> 05:21.653
You want a beer?

05:21.655 --> 05:24.989
I was planning on looking
at pictures of birds later,

05:24.991 --> 05:26.858
and I don't want to be all
fuzzy-headed for that.

05:26.860 --> 05:28.860
Listen, Quagmire,
we hate you now.

05:28.862 --> 05:30.328
Yeah, you used to be fun.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.697
Yeah, now you're always either
preparing for a colonoscopy

05:32.699 --> 05:34.332
or just coming back
from a colonoscopy.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.867
The (bleep) going on
down there?

05:35.869 --> 05:37.869
Well, that's what we're
trying to figure out.

05:37.871 --> 05:39.704
Come on, we want
our buddy back.

05:39.706 --> 05:41.339
I'm not putting that
toupee on again, Peter.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.842
So... I-I'm not sure
what you want me to do.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.443
You could get
a hair transplant.

05:45.445 --> 05:48.213
Oh, yeah. Like one of
those guys pretending
to get out of the pool.

05:48.215 --> 05:49.614
That looks all right.

05:49.616 --> 05:51.516
Yeah, come on, Quagmire.
Get the hair transplant.

05:51.518 --> 05:52.517
Come back to us.

05:52.519 --> 05:54.352
You're right.
This isn't me.

05:54.354 --> 05:56.721
Baldness is for women's
crotches, not men's heads.

05:56.723 --> 05:58.857
There you go,
that's pretty gross.

05:58.859 --> 06:00.525
Yeah, that's the spirit,
Quagmire.

06:00.527 --> 06:02.694
Oh, boy, listen, thanks
for putting up with me

06:02.696 --> 06:04.229
the last couple weeks.
Hey, no problem.

06:04.231 --> 06:06.865
You put up with me
when I was barefoot guy.

06:06.867 --> 06:09.234
Boy, nothing like a beer
with the fellas, eh?

06:09.236 --> 06:11.803
Peter, would you mind
putting on some shoes?

06:11.805 --> 06:12.971
Oh, you mean
foot prisons?

06:12.973 --> 06:13.705
Yes, I would.

06:17.042 --> 06:19.310
Glenn Quagmire?

06:19.312 --> 06:20.812
Why does that name
sound familiar?

06:20.814 --> 06:22.413
Oh, yeah, I treated
you for butt flu.

06:22.415 --> 06:23.915
Hey, you want
to keep it down?

06:23.917 --> 06:25.316
Easy now. That's
my privilege

06:25.318 --> 06:27.385
as a doctor to talk
about that stuff.

06:29.255 --> 06:30.889
How's it going,
Dr. Kamada?

06:30.891 --> 06:32.957
Bob!

06:33.893 --> 06:35.894
Mattaaayy.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.595
Oh, hiya, Rachael.

06:37.597 --> 06:39.230
Oh, hey, Dr. Geller.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.598
Sarah.

06:40.600 --> 06:42.233
Jim.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.835
Merianna.

06:43.837 --> 06:44.769
Geez, Joe.

06:44.771 --> 06:46.337
Yeah, I come here a lot.

06:46.339 --> 06:47.739
All right, I'm gonna
hit the john.

06:47.741 --> 06:50.408
Good. Me and Joe can stay here
and tell secrets.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.844
I'm wearing my dead
grandmother's panties.

06:52.846 --> 06:55.780
DOCTOR: I'm sorry
to have to tell you this,

06:55.782 --> 06:58.583
Mr. Pewterschmidt,
but the cancer is terminal.

06:58.585 --> 07:00.752
If you're lucky,
you've got two weeks to live.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.587
I understand.

07:02.589 --> 07:03.922
Oh, my God!

07:03.924 --> 07:05.924
Carter's dying?!

07:05.926 --> 07:09.861
I now declare this
hair transplant
officially over!

07:09.863 --> 07:10.862
(fires gun)

07:10.864 --> 07:11.796
Hey, hey, hey!

07:11.798 --> 07:12.797
He's back!

07:12.799 --> 07:14.766
You look great,
Quagmire.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.100
(pager beeping)

07:16.102 --> 07:19.103
Oh, my God.
One of my patients
on Two has been shot.

07:23.809 --> 07:24.876
Hey, Stewie.

07:24.878 --> 07:26.277
Um, hey, what's up?

07:26.279 --> 07:28.646
Were you-- were you just
looking at Rollerblades?

07:28.648 --> 07:29.814
What? No.
Yeah, who cares?

07:29.816 --> 07:30.882
What do you want?

07:30.884 --> 07:32.884
Listen, I was at the hospital
earlier,

07:32.886 --> 07:34.953
and I heard something
I wish I hadn't.

07:34.955 --> 07:37.789
Oh, please do not tell me
it was a sexist remark,

07:37.791 --> 07:39.791
because... because
that is not okay.

07:39.793 --> 07:42.226
You know, those nurses
are busting their asses,

07:42.228 --> 07:44.329
weighing people and
seeing how tall they are.

07:44.331 --> 07:47.899
Stewie, I heard a doctor tell
Carter he has two weeks to live.

07:47.901 --> 07:49.801
What? Are you sure?

07:49.803 --> 07:51.169
I saw it with my own eyes.

07:51.171 --> 07:53.071
I gotta check this out.

07:53.073 --> 07:54.806
Oh, my God, you're right!

07:54.808 --> 07:56.140
He looks awful.

07:56.142 --> 07:58.343
(beeping)

07:58.345 --> 07:59.811
Wait, how are
we seeing this?

07:59.813 --> 08:02.013
Oh, I've got a nanny cam
hidden inside his house.

08:02.015 --> 08:05.016
Watching him nail his
cleaning woman is how
I'm learning Spanish.

08:05.018 --> 08:07.752
Although I'm not sure what
the Spanish word "no" means,

08:07.754 --> 08:10.154
because it doesn't seem to mean
the same thing as it does here.

08:10.156 --> 08:12.991
And the worst part is, I don't
think Lois even knows he's sick.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.993
Oh, this is going
to destroy her!

08:14.995 --> 08:17.829
Oh, just thinking about
it makes me all giddy.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.931
Like a group of women
ordering dessert.

08:19.933 --> 08:21.866
And then we
have a chocolate,
chocolate cake

08:21.868 --> 08:24.535
that's infused
with chocolate served
with chocolate ice cream

08:24.537 --> 08:25.937
and a molten
chocolate topping.

08:25.939 --> 08:27.839
We'll have one of those
with four spoons.

08:27.841 --> 08:30.541
More like four of those
with one spoon for me!

08:30.543 --> 08:33.611
(continuous, staccato,
giddy laughter)

08:41.854 --> 08:43.855
Oh, hi, Brian.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.023
Hey, Lois.

08:45.025 --> 08:48.292
Listen, I have something
I need to tell you, but...

08:48.294 --> 08:49.894
it might be difficult for you
to hear.

08:49.896 --> 08:51.029
What is it?

08:51.031 --> 08:52.196
Lois...

08:52.198 --> 08:53.965
I think your father is dying.

08:53.967 --> 08:55.700
What?!
(flashbulb pops)

08:55.702 --> 08:56.801
Ha!

08:56.803 --> 08:58.870
Brian, what are you
talking about?

08:58.872 --> 09:00.471
Well, yesterday at the hospital,

09:00.473 --> 09:02.907
I heard a doctor tell him
he has cancer...

09:02.909 --> 09:04.876
and that he has
two weeks to live.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.377
Oh, my God.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.046
Oh, my God, Daddy!

09:08.048 --> 09:09.881
Yeah, I feel really
horrible for you,

09:09.883 --> 09:11.549
and I hate to do this,

09:11.551 --> 09:13.217
but I'm trying to
catch a 4:50 movie,

09:13.219 --> 09:15.887
and it's, like, 4:40 now, and,
so, if I'm going to make it,

09:15.889 --> 09:17.955
I have to leave,
like, now.

09:21.827 --> 09:23.828
Yeah, this-this stinks,

09:23.830 --> 09:27.131
but I've already
blown this guy off,
like, twice, so...

09:31.336 --> 09:33.571
I've been trying to call
my parents all day,

09:33.573 --> 09:35.239
and I can't get
ahold of them.

09:35.241 --> 09:37.408
I'll tell ya, this
obituary came out great.

09:37.410 --> 09:40.745
"Carter Pewterschmidt died
today of the disease cancer.

09:40.747 --> 09:42.413
"In lieu of flowers,
please send

09:42.415 --> 09:45.750
carnival rides to Peter Griffin
at 31 Spooner Street."

09:45.752 --> 09:47.518
If we get just one
ride out of this,

09:47.520 --> 09:48.986
it will have
been a success.

09:53.759 --> 09:54.759
Lois?

09:54.761 --> 09:55.960
Wh-What are you
doing here?

09:55.962 --> 09:58.362
Mom, I've been trying
to get ahold of you.

09:58.364 --> 10:00.031
Is Daddy okay?
Where is he?

10:00.033 --> 10:02.033
Oh, he's fine, dear.

10:02.035 --> 10:03.434
But now's not
a good time.

10:03.436 --> 10:04.936
He's very busy.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.604
Look, I know
something's going on.

10:06.606 --> 10:07.772
I want to see him.

10:09.808 --> 10:11.142
Daddy?!

10:11.144 --> 10:13.878
Well, look who's here!

10:13.880 --> 10:15.880
Daddy! You're okay!

10:15.882 --> 10:17.615
Of course I'm okay!
Why wouldn't I be?

10:17.617 --> 10:19.984
Well, Brian said
you were dying!

10:19.986 --> 10:20.985
And I finished a book!

10:20.987 --> 10:23.221
I promised myself
I'd work that in.

10:23.223 --> 10:25.223
I-It's-- I might've
jumped the gun.

10:25.225 --> 10:26.390
I didn't finish it.

10:26.392 --> 10:28.793
I'm so glad
you're all right.

10:28.795 --> 10:31.462
Brian, how could you get us
all worked up like that?!

10:31.464 --> 10:32.997
Yeah, shame on you!

10:32.999 --> 10:34.499
Oh, you're gonna
get it, Brian.

10:34.501 --> 10:37.034
You are gonna get it
when I drink.

10:37.503 --> 10:39.137
What the hell's going on?

10:39.139 --> 10:40.838
Last night,
Carter was on
his deathbed,

10:40.840 --> 10:42.473
and now he looks better
than he ever did.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.242
Well, they say laughter
is the best medicine.

10:44.244 --> 10:46.177
Maybe he went to a
comedy club or something.

10:46.179 --> 10:47.645
(audience laughing)

10:47.647 --> 10:48.646
In my neighborhood,

10:48.648 --> 10:49.981
we didn't have no Kool-Aid.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.983
We had food colorin' and water.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.818
Mama used to call it
"Fool-Aid."

10:53.820 --> 10:55.820
(laughter)
CARTER: No, I don't get that.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.655
And everybody had an Uncle Earl.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.657
You know, that uncle
that sit around in the house

10:59.659 --> 11:02.493
all day in his underdrawers,
saying he "between" jobs.

11:02.495 --> 11:03.928
To be between jobs,

11:03.930 --> 11:05.997
you had to have had a job
in the first place!

11:05.999 --> 11:07.098
CARTER:
That's accurate!

11:07.100 --> 11:08.866
And Earl got that cell phone.

11:08.868 --> 11:10.501
He on the Sprint plan.

11:10.503 --> 11:11.836
When the bill come, he sprint.

11:11.838 --> 11:15.072
CARTER: Yes! So many of them
are delinquent in payment.

11:19.011 --> 11:20.845
Rupert, move your legs.

11:20.847 --> 11:22.013
I can see your balls.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.948
Stewie, this is
going to sound crazy,

11:23.950 --> 11:26.450
but I have a theory about
what's going on with Carter.

11:26.452 --> 11:27.518
Really? What is it?

11:27.520 --> 11:28.553
Well, think about it.

11:28.555 --> 11:29.954
If Carter Pewterschmidt,

11:29.956 --> 11:31.789
the dynamic chairman of
Pewterschmidt Industries,

11:31.791 --> 11:33.457
were to fall ill
or even die,

11:33.459 --> 11:34.892
the stock price
would plummet.

11:34.894 --> 11:37.028
I don't want you to think
I'm not listening,

11:37.030 --> 11:38.629
but when's Christmas?
Not for a while.

11:38.631 --> 11:40.698
But what I'm saying is,
I think Carter is sick

11:40.700 --> 11:43.534
or possibly even dead,
and that the man we saw today

11:43.536 --> 11:45.203
was an imposter
brought in to keep

11:45.205 --> 11:47.038
Pewterschmidt Industries'
stock price up

11:47.040 --> 11:49.040
and to keep people
from knowing the truth.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.875
Boy, you are just
going to keep on talking

11:50.877 --> 11:52.643
with that poppy seed
stuck in your teeth, aren't you?

11:52.645 --> 11:53.978
Anyway, what are you
suggesting?

11:53.980 --> 11:55.580
We can follow him, see
if he's really Carter.

11:55.582 --> 11:57.481
Okay, but I got to be
home by 7:00.

11:57.483 --> 11:58.916
I'm supposed to talk
to the police

11:58.918 --> 12:00.151
about that shooting
I witnessed.

12:02.721 --> 12:04.755
Good Lord, are
you all right?

12:04.757 --> 12:05.890
If I die,

12:05.892 --> 12:08.926
leave two dollars
worth of flowers right here.

12:08.928 --> 12:11.729
Here's my fourth grade
class photo.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.731
Lean it against
a cheap candle.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.099
Well, should I call
an ambulance?

12:15.101 --> 12:16.901
No. Call Channel Nine.

12:16.903 --> 12:20.004
And have a gap-toothed
woman say, quote,

12:20.006 --> 12:22.340
"He never bothered nobody."

12:25.677 --> 12:28.079
Okay, if this guy is an
imposter, he's going to have

12:28.081 --> 12:29.580
to do everything
Carter normally does.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.849
We just have to wait
and see if he slips up.

12:31.851 --> 12:33.317
All right,
here he comes now.

12:39.358 --> 12:40.925
All right, Stu, now,
if we can just...

12:40.927 --> 12:42.126
No.
What?

12:42.128 --> 12:43.761
You know what you did.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.096
Hey, wait a minute.

12:45.098 --> 12:46.364
If this is an imposter,

12:46.366 --> 12:48.032
then this guy we're following
never had cancer.

12:48.034 --> 12:49.433
Yeah, so?

12:49.435 --> 12:51.602
Well, you're a dog.
Can't you just sniff cancer?

12:51.604 --> 12:52.937
No, that's just a
myth we started

12:52.939 --> 12:55.439
so we could stick our
snouts in girls' boobs.

12:55.441 --> 12:57.608
It's nice to have a
clean bill of health.

12:57.610 --> 12:58.776
Well, for now.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.444
The key is
weekly follow-ups.

13:00.446 --> 13:03.047
You know, cervical cancer
is also a problem.

13:03.049 --> 13:05.283
My boyfriend thinks he
might have prostate cancer.

13:05.285 --> 13:06.784
Nope, doesn't.

13:12.224 --> 13:13.958
Okay, now we've got him.

13:13.960 --> 13:16.127
The real Carter would
never go to a Starbucks.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.863
He thinks they're too
liberal and pretentious.

13:20.565 --> 13:22.066
Coffee for Brent.

13:22.068 --> 13:23.734
(snickering)

13:23.736 --> 13:25.836
Latte for Cecil.

13:25.838 --> 13:27.638
(snickering)

13:27.640 --> 13:29.006
Beanie?

13:29.008 --> 13:31.475
(laughs) None of those
people are real.

13:31.477 --> 13:34.178
I'm stealing all your
sugar packets and napkins.

13:34.180 --> 13:37.048
Woodstock's over, (bleep).

13:47.426 --> 13:49.994
Wow. You certainly
look a lot better

13:49.996 --> 13:51.829
than that walking corpse
I saw last week.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.664
Well, no one's ever
going to see that again,

13:53.666 --> 13:54.832
I can promise you that.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.767
I can't stress how
important it is

13:56.769 --> 13:58.169
our secret be kept
from the public.

13:58.171 --> 13:59.503
I understand, sir.

13:59.505 --> 14:01.839
And I assure you
that Specimen Z

14:01.841 --> 14:03.841
is secure on level 12.

14:03.843 --> 14:07.845
That "walking corpse" was
Carter dying of cancer.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.513
This guy is an imposter.

14:09.515 --> 14:11.015
Oh, my God.

14:11.017 --> 14:13.684
And I bet Specimen Z
is the real Carter's body.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.052
You two didn't
hear that, did you?

14:15.054 --> 14:16.187
BRIAN:
Hey, buddy, we're...

14:16.189 --> 14:17.955
we're just trying to
read the paper here.

14:17.957 --> 14:19.790
I'll have you fired
for talking to me like that.

14:19.792 --> 14:21.025
I don't work here.

14:21.027 --> 14:22.927
Then I'll have you killed.
I want to die.

14:23.862 --> 14:25.930
I hated that guy back there.

14:28.967 --> 14:31.202
Okay, this is level 12.

14:31.204 --> 14:32.536
There's the lab.

14:32.538 --> 14:34.372
Let's get in there
and find Carter's body.

14:34.374 --> 14:35.873
Oh, crap, there's a keypad.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.708
All right, we're just
going to have to try

14:37.710 --> 14:38.909
and figure out the code.

14:38.911 --> 14:39.877
When's his birthday?

14:39.879 --> 14:41.579
I think it's in March.

14:41.581 --> 14:43.047
Stewie, are you crazy?

14:43.049 --> 14:44.548
That's so loud.
The guards will hear.

14:44.550 --> 14:45.750
Don't worry
about it, Bri...

14:45.752 --> 14:47.551
MAN: Hey, what's
going on down there?

14:47.553 --> 14:49.053
Nothing.

14:49.055 --> 14:50.721
All right.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.323
All right, now,
where would they keep

14:52.325 --> 14:54.825
a dead body
in a pharmaceutical lab?

14:54.827 --> 14:56.560
(gasps) Brian, look.

14:57.896 --> 15:00.131
That's it.
I bet he's in there.

15:09.441 --> 15:11.342
Oh, my God.

15:11.344 --> 15:13.911
Specimen Z isn't Carter's body.

15:13.913 --> 15:14.912
What is it?

15:14.914 --> 15:17.815
Specimen Z is a
cure for cancer.

15:20.085 --> 15:22.520
Carter didn't die.
He cured himself.

15:22.522 --> 15:24.355
CARTER:
Hold it right there.
(both gasp)

15:24.357 --> 15:26.023
Damn it, Brian.
You broke into my lab.

15:26.025 --> 15:27.758
And you didn't wear a suit.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.027
Hey, why didn't he
have to wear a suit?

15:30.029 --> 15:31.595
See what you've started now?

15:36.968 --> 15:39.470
Carter, you've found
a cure for cancer?

15:39.472 --> 15:40.971
Well, I didn't come up with it.

15:40.973 --> 15:42.273
A couple of eggheads
I hired did.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.141
One of them's a Chinese.

15:44.143 --> 15:45.943
Boy, I don't like those people.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.546
But holy crap, wind 'em up
and watch 'em go.

15:48.548 --> 15:49.980
How long have you had this?

15:49.982 --> 15:51.449
I don't know.
When... when was that

15:51.451 --> 15:52.950
"Who Let the Dogs Out?" song?

15:52.952 --> 15:54.785
You've had this since 1999?

15:54.787 --> 15:57.121
You know when "Who Let
the Dogs Out?" came out?

15:57.123 --> 15:59.156
It's a song about dogs
and letting them out.

15:59.158 --> 16:01.625
I could have you arrested
for breaking in here.

16:01.627 --> 16:04.061
Carter, you've discovered the
holy grail of modern medicine.

16:04.063 --> 16:06.297
Why the hell would you
keep it buried like this?

16:06.299 --> 16:07.398
I'll tell you why.

16:07.400 --> 16:08.966
Because there's
far more money to be made

16:08.968 --> 16:10.968
in treating a disease
than in curing it.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.803
Why cure someone
of cancer in a day

16:12.805 --> 16:14.405
if we can treat them
for a lifetime

16:14.407 --> 16:16.006
and bill them
every step along the way?

16:16.008 --> 16:17.641
What? That's insane.

16:17.643 --> 16:19.977
Brian, it's so cold in here,
look how big my nips are.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.979
They're almost like a woman's.

16:21.981 --> 16:25.483
Oh, look, I'm tugging at 'em
and they're getting even bigger.

16:25.485 --> 16:26.817
Carter, what you're
doing here is criminal,

16:26.819 --> 16:28.919
and I'm going to tell the
whole world about it.

16:28.921 --> 16:30.688
Is that right?
Who's going to believe you?

16:30.690 --> 16:31.989
The Internet?

16:31.991 --> 16:34.158
You'll be just another nut-job,
left-wing blogger.

16:34.160 --> 16:35.593
Security!

16:35.595 --> 16:36.827
MAN:
Everything's fine.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.062
No, it isn't. Get in here.

16:39.831 --> 16:41.665
Ah! Damn it! You bastards.

16:41.667 --> 16:43.667
I don't know why you're
surprised by this, Brian.

16:43.669 --> 16:45.503
Big corporations
never tell the truth.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.605
Look at the
Kleenex industry.

16:47.607 --> 16:48.839
Well, we had another
good quarter.

16:48.841 --> 16:51.041
I guess a lot of people
are sneezing out there.

16:51.043 --> 16:52.877
Jerry, I'm going to let you
in on something,

16:52.879 --> 16:54.845
and it can't
leave this room.

16:54.847 --> 16:55.846
Our research shows

16:55.848 --> 16:58.115
the primary use
of our product is sperm.

16:58.117 --> 16:59.216
What?

16:59.218 --> 17:01.018
Yeah, and brace
yourself for this.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.787
The second biggest use
is women crying about nonsense.

17:03.789 --> 17:05.122
But I thought
sneezing was...

17:05.124 --> 17:08.092
Jerry, Jerry,
it's sperm and nonsense.

17:10.562 --> 17:11.795
I can't believe Carter

17:11.797 --> 17:13.531
would sacrifice
millions of lives

17:13.533 --> 17:14.865
just to protect
corporate profits.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.300
Well, don't be too upset.

17:16.302 --> 17:17.635
Old Stewie here snagged

17:17.637 --> 17:19.537
a little souvenir
on his way out.

17:19.539 --> 17:21.038
Oh, my God, Stewie.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.039
You got the cancer cure.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.541
How'd you manage to steal it?

17:23.543 --> 17:25.075
Oh, it was easy--
I just took it

17:25.077 --> 17:26.577
while you guys
were yammering on.

17:26.579 --> 17:28.312
I swear, I felt
like I was waiting

17:28.314 --> 17:29.880
for Lois to get
off the phone.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.715
Well, that is amazing.

17:31.717 --> 17:32.917
All right, Bonnie.

17:32.919 --> 17:34.552
Well, it was good
talking to you.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.487
No way. She did?

17:36.489 --> 17:37.922
When did she say that?

17:37.924 --> 17:39.256
You know what?

17:39.258 --> 17:42.159
That doesn't surprise me.
That's how she is.

17:42.161 --> 17:44.495
Okay, then. Okay.

17:44.497 --> 17:46.564
Okay. Okay.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.499
All right,
I'll see you Tuesday.

17:48.501 --> 17:51.569
Oh, no. What happened?

17:51.571 --> 17:53.337
(gasps) That's terrible.

17:53.339 --> 17:55.906
Oh, my God, just awful.

17:55.908 --> 17:57.942
Well, you
give them my best.

17:57.944 --> 17:59.276
Okay, I got to go.

17:59.278 --> 18:01.445
Stewie and I are headed
out to the beach.

18:01.447 --> 18:02.913
Oh, I didn't tell you?

18:02.915 --> 18:04.748
He's learning to swim.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.917
Oh, I got him
the cutest swim trunks.

18:06.919 --> 18:08.419
At Kohl's.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.354
You've never
been to Kohl's?

18:10.356 --> 18:12.356
Well, let me tell you
about Kohl's.

18:12.358 --> 18:13.691
(sighs)

18:13.693 --> 18:15.926
All right, well, you know
the mall with the Chili's?

18:15.928 --> 18:17.261
It's across the street.

18:17.263 --> 18:18.462
(gunshot, Bonnie shrieks)

18:18.464 --> 18:19.863
Bonnie?
Bonnie, are you there?

18:19.865 --> 18:21.565
What happened?
STEWIE:
Let's go!

18:25.036 --> 18:26.804
Oh, there you two are.

18:26.806 --> 18:27.871
Lois, there's
something incredible

18:27.873 --> 18:29.106
I have to tell you.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.274
And there's
something incredible

18:30.276 --> 18:31.609
I have to show you.

18:31.611 --> 18:34.178
I learned how to
do a somersault.

18:35.614 --> 18:36.780
Did I do it?

18:36.782 --> 18:38.649
There he is.

18:38.651 --> 18:40.784
Crap.

18:40.786 --> 18:42.786
Daddy? What's going on here?

18:42.788 --> 18:45.823
Brian here has stolen something
very important from me.

18:45.825 --> 18:48.125
Give it to me, Brian.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.960
Lois, your father
has a cure for cancer,

18:49.962 --> 18:51.962
but he won't release it
because it's not profitable.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.631
So I stole it.

18:53.633 --> 18:54.999
Daddy, is this true?

18:55.001 --> 18:56.467
Yeah. So what?

18:56.469 --> 18:58.802
So I found the cure for cancer
and didn't announce it.

18:58.804 --> 19:00.471
Big deal.
I also took a dump today

19:00.473 --> 19:01.972
and didn't issue
a press release.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.674
Oh, that's interesting,
because I did.

19:03.676 --> 19:05.142
Good for Peter.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.911
It's about time the media
covered something positive.

19:07.913 --> 19:10.347
Daddy, you're the chairman
of a billion dollar company.

19:10.349 --> 19:11.982
You've got more
money than anyone

19:11.984 --> 19:13.817
could ever spend
in one lifetime.

19:13.819 --> 19:16.654
Are you challenging me
to a <i>Brewster's Millions?</i>

19:16.656 --> 19:18.656
Is money all that
you care about?

19:18.658 --> 19:20.991
What if somebody close
to you got cancer?

19:20.993 --> 19:23.260
What if... what if the
maid who raised you

19:23.262 --> 19:26.030
'cause your parents were too
wealthy and busy got cancer?

19:26.032 --> 19:27.331
You mean Mamie?

19:27.333 --> 19:29.333
Yeah.
What if Mamie got cancer?

19:29.335 --> 19:30.934
Mamie's not getting cancer!

19:30.936 --> 19:32.336
Or how about one of us?

19:32.338 --> 19:34.672
What if I got cancer
or, God forbid,

19:34.674 --> 19:36.507
one of your grandchildren?

19:36.509 --> 19:39.877
For once in your life,
do the right thing.

19:39.879 --> 19:41.378
All right, pumpkin.

19:41.380 --> 19:42.846
I'll do it.

19:42.848 --> 19:44.548
I'll do it for you.

19:44.550 --> 19:46.684
You will? You promise?

19:46.686 --> 19:47.785
Yes.

19:47.787 --> 19:49.053
I'll make the
announcement tomorrow.

19:49.055 --> 19:50.521
Oh, Daddy.

19:50.523 --> 19:51.555
Thank you so much.

19:51.557 --> 19:53.223
You're my hero.

19:53.225 --> 19:55.959
Oh, that's her father?

19:59.898 --> 20:00.964
Good afternoon. I'm Tom Tucker.

20:00.966 --> 20:02.866
Our top story:
a big announcement

20:02.868 --> 20:05.102
out of Pewterschmidt
Pharmaceuticals today.

20:07.205 --> 20:08.806
Company chairman
Carter Pewterschmidt

20:08.808 --> 20:10.407
released a statement
announcing the launch

20:10.409 --> 20:12.543
of a deodorant
for the developmentally disabled

20:12.545 --> 20:13.977
called Slow Stick.

20:13.979 --> 20:18.048
It's also edible because,
you know, those people...

20:18.050 --> 20:20.084
don't, uh... don't know...

20:20.086 --> 20:21.719
And now sports.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.220
That's it?
What the hell?

20:23.222 --> 20:25.222
Where's the cancer
cure announcement?

20:25.224 --> 20:28.125
That son of a bitch
went back on his word.

20:29.394 --> 20:30.828
CARTER:
Hello.

20:30.830 --> 20:32.930
Daddy, we're all sitting here
in front of the TV

20:32.932 --> 20:34.498
awaiting the big announcement.

20:34.500 --> 20:37.835
Remember the one that's
going to benefit all mankind?

20:37.837 --> 20:40.738
The one you promised to make
for me, your daughter?

20:40.740 --> 20:42.272
I lied.
(line clicks)

20:42.274 --> 20:44.007
Lois, you can't
stay mad at him.

20:44.009 --> 20:45.275
He's rich and successful.

20:45.277 --> 20:46.910
It doesn't excuse
what he did.

20:46.912 --> 20:47.778
It'll be fine.

20:47.780 --> 20:49.580
He'll just do
a magazine cover

20:49.582 --> 20:52.015
with a wink to who he is,
and all will be forgiven.

20:53.918 --> 20:58.856
Oh, Daddy.
I know. If he's such a bad
guy, why's he on a magazine?
