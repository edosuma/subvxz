( country music plays
on radio )

03:15.963 --> 03:17.097
Jesus!

03:17.097 --> 03:20.133
( horn honks )

03:20.133 --> 03:21.469
( horn honks )

03:21.469 --> 03:22.936
Man, did you
see that?

03:22.936 --> 03:24.805
I mean, he
pulled right out
in front of me.

03:24.805 --> 03:26.840
Took my eyes
off the road
for a second,

03:26.840 --> 03:29.410
but, I mean,
come on.

03:29.410 --> 03:31.945
Maybe it's time we
take a little break.

03:34.448 --> 03:38.552
Yeah, I'll pull over
the next chance we get.

04:16.757 --> 04:19.059
Nice car.

04:19.059 --> 04:21.329
Thanks.

04:21.329 --> 04:23.864
You got your air,

04:23.864 --> 04:26.667
CD...

04:26.667 --> 04:29.470
leather.

04:31.004 --> 04:34.074
Looks to me like you
sprung for the whole 9 yards.

04:34.074 --> 04:36.610
Yeah, I guess so.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.546
But I suppose that
rig of yours there

04:38.546 --> 04:40.814
is what you really
need out here, huh?

04:40.814 --> 04:43.216
Why would you want
a piece of shit like that

04:43.216 --> 04:45.619
when you got
a ride like this?

04:51.359 --> 04:54.528
What a man needs
out here is a CB radio.

04:54.528 --> 04:56.697
Yeah, is that right?

04:58.031 --> 05:00.568
Of course,
if you use a CB, you
got to have a handle.

05:00.568 --> 05:03.371
I'm thinking for you...

05:03.371 --> 05:04.605
...shit for brains.

05:04.605 --> 05:06.440
Tell me something.
Do you even care

05:06.440 --> 05:08.241
that you damn near
killed us back there,
boy?

05:08.241 --> 05:10.544
I--I didn't really
even see you, OK?

05:10.544 --> 05:12.279
I mean, you kind of
pulled out in front of me.

05:12.279 --> 05:14.214
Like hell I did!
I saw what happened.

05:14.214 --> 05:16.550
Let's just
forget this, OK?

05:16.550 --> 05:18.919
I mean, I'm sorry
it ever happened.

05:18.919 --> 05:21.121
I don't want any trouble.
I mean...

05:21.121 --> 05:23.957
No, I bet you don't.

05:27.395 --> 05:28.629
Howdy, ma'am.

05:28.629 --> 05:31.098
Ought to be more careful
who you ride with.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.034
What is that
all about?

05:34.034 --> 05:35.403
Nothing.

05:35.403 --> 05:37.037
The guy in the truck.

05:37.037 --> 05:39.540
Thinks I
tried to hit him.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.479
Come on, let's go.

05:45.479 --> 05:46.480
You want me to drive?

05:46.480 --> 05:48.949
No. Later.
Just get in.

05:50.117 --> 05:52.920
How about if I promise
not to sideswipe anyone?

05:52.920 --> 05:54.588
Just get in.

05:54.588 --> 05:56.624
I'm kidding.

06:17.578 --> 06:19.980
( country music plays
on radio )

06:21.515 --> 06:23.851
You getting ready
for the Grand Prix?

06:28.288 --> 06:30.458
What'd you get?

06:30.458 --> 06:32.159
Oh, junk food fiesta.

06:32.159 --> 06:34.127
Let's see.

06:34.127 --> 06:37.064
Snowballs...

06:37.064 --> 06:38.499
Yoo-hoo,

06:38.499 --> 06:41.502
and moon pies.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.070
Believe they still
make this stuff?

06:43.070 --> 06:46.740
You kidding? It's
probably gourmet cuisine
around here.

06:55.115 --> 06:56.484
Ha ha ha ha.

06:56.484 --> 06:58.919
This is crazy.
Look at this.

06:58.919 --> 07:03.491
It says, "If you win
this mail-in contest,

07:03.491 --> 07:08.095
"you can choose
between $90,000

07:08.095 --> 07:10.898
or 90,000 donuts."

07:15.035 --> 07:18.138
What would you do
with 90,000 donuts?

07:18.138 --> 07:20.040
I don't know.

07:20.040 --> 07:23.443
Sell them for 30 cents each
and pay off this car.

07:23.443 --> 07:26.079
No kidding.

07:26.079 --> 07:28.015
( sighs )

07:28.015 --> 07:31.051
$90,000.

07:32.219 --> 07:35.322
That would solve
some problems.

07:35.322 --> 07:36.957
( alarm buzzes )

07:36.957 --> 07:38.559
( engine knocks )

07:39.593 --> 07:40.594
What the hell's...

07:40.594 --> 07:42.029
What did you do?

07:42.029 --> 07:44.565
Nothing. I--

07:44.565 --> 07:47.400
( engine quits )

07:47.400 --> 07:49.503
Hang on.
I can't steer.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.135
( sighs )

08:32.044 --> 08:34.081
( beep )

08:34.081 --> 08:35.649
( dialing )

08:35.649 --> 08:37.250
( beeps )

08:37.250 --> 08:38.385
Perfect.

08:38.385 --> 08:40.788
Out of range?

08:41.889 --> 08:45.058
Well, so much for
taking the scenic route.

08:47.060 --> 08:50.363
Well, it looks
like the baffle gasket
is burned out.

08:50.363 --> 08:51.765
What?

08:51.765 --> 08:53.667
Yeah, it's connected to
the, uh, connecting rod.

08:53.667 --> 08:56.469
God. Shut up.

08:56.469 --> 09:00.540
Oh, man, can you
believe this?

09:00.540 --> 09:02.275
This could be
the worst decision

09:02.275 --> 09:03.677
we've ever made.

09:03.677 --> 09:05.045
What are you doing?
No, just listen.

09:05.045 --> 09:08.749
I mean, we're
changing jobs, right?
Yeah.

09:08.749 --> 09:11.284
Our finances
are pretty well ...

09:11.284 --> 09:12.519
Yeah.

09:12.519 --> 09:14.187
And we are out in
the middle of nowhere,

09:14.187 --> 09:17.658
so, yeah, I'd say this
is the worst decision--

09:17.658 --> 09:21.094
Get out of here.
You're bugging me.

09:21.094 --> 09:22.763
OK, sweetie.

09:22.763 --> 09:24.732
Good luck, 'cause
I'm going to California.

09:24.732 --> 09:27.367
No problem. Just
leave me the moon pies.

09:27.367 --> 09:28.435
Uh, Jeff?

09:28.435 --> 09:29.837
And the donuts.

09:29.837 --> 09:32.606
No. No.
There's a car.

09:34.474 --> 09:37.177
Oh, Christ.
Not these guys.

09:37.177 --> 09:39.146
( horn honks )

09:39.146 --> 09:42.082
( honk honk )

09:46.186 --> 09:47.788
Assholes.

10:01.669 --> 10:03.704
Jeff?

10:15.716 --> 10:17.651
What the hell is--

10:19.586 --> 10:21.454
What's he doing?

10:21.454 --> 10:23.290
I don't know.

10:27.861 --> 10:30.630
Well, this--
This isn't good.

10:37.771 --> 10:39.907
Hey! Whoa!

11:01.094 --> 11:01.895
Hi.

11:01.895 --> 11:03.063
You folks
all right?

11:03.063 --> 11:05.665
Fine.
Our car broke down.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.167
Yeah, I saw that.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.269
You want me to
give you a hand
pushing it off the road?

11:09.269 --> 11:10.337
Thanks
for the help.

11:10.337 --> 11:12.039
Honey, you
want to steer?

11:13.340 --> 11:15.809
OK. Ready? OK.

11:17.277 --> 11:19.279
Massachusetts plates.

11:19.279 --> 11:21.314
You folks on vacation?

11:21.314 --> 11:23.083
No, we're moving.

11:23.083 --> 11:25.318
Oh, yeah?
Whereabouts?

11:25.318 --> 11:27.955
Uh, San Diego.

11:27.955 --> 11:30.223
Listen, do you
think we could
use your CB,

11:30.223 --> 11:32.559
radio a tow truck
to help us?

11:32.559 --> 11:33.927
I wish I could,
mister,

11:33.927 --> 11:35.462
but I blew a fuse
on that thing
this morning.

11:35.462 --> 11:36.864
I'm waiting till
I get down to the
truck stop at I-40

11:36.864 --> 11:38.799
to get it fixed.

11:38.799 --> 11:39.833
How far is that?

11:39.833 --> 11:41.434
About 60 miles.

11:41.434 --> 11:42.702
Oh.

11:42.702 --> 11:45.272
Well, just driving along
and she quit on me.

11:45.272 --> 11:49.242
Oh, yeah, well, belts--
Battery's working.

11:49.242 --> 11:51.144
You know, it used to be
you'd give these things
a kick and a holler

11:51.144 --> 11:52.212
and they'd start right up.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.281
Now they got
computers and chips.

11:54.281 --> 11:55.883
It is a new car.

11:55.883 --> 11:57.384
You know,
that could be it.

11:57.384 --> 11:59.186
You been riding
this thing pretty hard?

11:59.186 --> 12:01.989
'Cause they tend to
overheat when they're new.

12:04.624 --> 12:08.561
Well, yeah, a little,
but I...

12:08.561 --> 12:10.831
Tell you what.

12:10.831 --> 12:12.399
I can give you
a ride to Belle's,

12:12.399 --> 12:14.001
a little diner about
5 miles down the road.

12:14.001 --> 12:15.702
They got a pay phone.
You call a tow truck,

12:15.702 --> 12:17.537
they just come in
and haul you out.

12:17.537 --> 12:21.608
Uh, you know,
that's really nice
of you to offer.

12:21.608 --> 12:23.310
I think you got it.

12:23.310 --> 12:25.545
I think we'll just
let her cool off
a little bit.

12:25.545 --> 12:27.680
OK.
Thanks a lot. We
really appreciate it.

12:27.680 --> 12:29.582
I wish you luck
getting it started.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.885
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.

12:31.885 --> 12:33.453
Honey.
I think he's right.

12:33.453 --> 12:35.923
I think it's probably
just overheated.

12:35.923 --> 12:37.424
Right.
But what if it's not?

12:37.424 --> 12:39.259
I mean,
we don't want to be
stuck out here, do we?

12:39.259 --> 12:42.129
No. But I--We just
give it some time.

12:42.129 --> 12:44.131
Let it cool off.
We'll be all right.

12:46.533 --> 12:48.368
Getting pretty
toasty out here.

12:48.368 --> 12:51.304
Are you sure you
want to blow this ride?

12:51.304 --> 12:52.439
No, but...

12:54.607 --> 12:56.910
I don't know if I want
to leave the car alone,
either.

12:56.910 --> 12:59.913
OK, what if
I take the ride,
call the tow truck,

12:59.913 --> 13:02.182
and order a nice
cold iced tea?

13:02.182 --> 13:05.218
Mm-hmm, and I stay here
with a nice hot car.

13:05.218 --> 13:06.719
Right.

13:06.719 --> 13:08.021
Right.

13:10.757 --> 13:12.059
You sure
you're all right?

13:12.059 --> 13:13.793
I'll be fine, honey.

13:16.096 --> 13:16.897
Hello!

13:16.897 --> 13:18.731
Excuse me!

13:18.731 --> 13:21.801
Mind if I take
you up on that ride?

13:21.801 --> 13:24.104
Sure.
Step on up.

13:25.738 --> 13:27.307
Sure your husband
wouldn't want to
come with us?

13:27.307 --> 13:28.508
There's plenty
of room in the back.

13:28.508 --> 13:31.011
No, he's going to
stay with the car.

14:36.876 --> 14:39.046
What the hell?

14:42.782 --> 14:45.585
( warning bell chimes )

14:51.858 --> 14:53.360
( engine starts )

14:53.360 --> 14:55.062
Ha!

14:56.529 --> 14:59.066
Hee hee hee.

14:59.066 --> 15:02.069
Old truck my ass.

15:27.827 --> 15:32.465
* Looks like
I'm lost again *

15:44.744 --> 15:46.013
Excuse me.

15:46.013 --> 15:47.514
I was supposed to
meet my wife here.

15:49.616 --> 15:51.618
She's dark-haired,
about 5'5",

15:51.618 --> 15:55.722
wearing, like,
a--a white
Benetton sweater.

15:55.722 --> 15:57.024
White what?

15:57.024 --> 15:59.526
Benetton sweater.

15:59.526 --> 16:01.794
Your order's up.

16:01.794 --> 16:04.064
Look, I'm pretty busy here.
People come and go.

16:04.064 --> 16:05.732
Well, this was
in the last half hour.

16:05.732 --> 16:08.568
She--She might have
been with a trucker.

16:08.568 --> 16:09.502
A trucker?

16:09.502 --> 16:10.737
Yeah. A guy wearing
a baseball cap,

16:10.737 --> 16:12.639
uh, driving
a big 18-wheeler.

16:14.341 --> 16:17.110
Doesn't ring a bell.

16:17.110 --> 16:18.645
You sure?

16:20.280 --> 16:22.382
Hey, the man here's
looking for his wife.

16:22.382 --> 16:25.285
Dark hair, got a white
button-on sweater,

16:25.285 --> 16:27.254
traveling with a guy
with a baseball cap.

16:27.254 --> 16:29.489
Has anybody here
seen 'em?

16:33.026 --> 16:36.496
Looks like she got
away from you, cowboy.

16:39.332 --> 16:40.567
You, uh,

16:40.567 --> 16:42.469
you think maybe
she could have
left a message

16:42.469 --> 16:44.637
with one of your
other employees or--

16:44.637 --> 16:46.273
Well, I don't see
how that's possible.

16:46.273 --> 16:47.707
You see, I'm the only one
that works here.

16:48.875 --> 16:50.543
Well...

16:51.511 --> 16:54.013
Is there another
Belle's diner?

16:54.013 --> 16:55.648
No, sirree.

16:55.648 --> 16:57.250
Definitely not.

17:38.725 --> 17:42.162
Excuse me. She and I
must have got our
signals crossed here.

17:42.162 --> 17:44.564
How far is
the next town?

17:44.564 --> 17:45.832
About 20 miles.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.335
Would you do me a favor?

17:48.335 --> 17:50.002
If my wife comes in--
her name's Amy--

17:50.002 --> 17:53.072
just tell her I was here
and tell her to stay put
till I get back,

17:53.072 --> 17:54.474
to not move.

17:54.474 --> 17:55.942
Could you do that,
please?

17:55.942 --> 17:57.944
Yeah, OK.

17:57.944 --> 18:00.213
Thanks.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.189
( horn honks )

18:44.824 --> 18:46.826
( honk honk )

18:54.167 --> 18:56.035

18:56.035 --> 18:57.670

19:01.341 --> 19:03.910
( honk honk honk )

19:03.910 --> 19:06.346
Hey, pull over!

19:08.248 --> 19:10.350
Pull over!

19:13.186 --> 19:15.855
( honk )

19:15.855 --> 19:18.258
I don't believe it.

19:20.092 --> 19:22.161
( horn honks )

19:22.161 --> 19:23.763
Jesus!

19:32.339 --> 19:33.840
Christ.

19:40.012 --> 19:43.483
( truck horn honks )

19:56.596 --> 19:58.765
Hey, man.

20:00.166 --> 20:01.868
What the hell
you doing, buddy?

20:01.868 --> 20:04.537
Well, I was trying
to get you to pull over.
Didn't you see me?

20:04.537 --> 20:05.538
Yeah.

20:05.538 --> 20:06.739
Well?

20:06.739 --> 20:09.709
Never mind. Listen,
I--I'm looking for my wife.

20:09.709 --> 20:10.510
What?

20:10.510 --> 20:11.878
My wife,
where is she?

20:11.878 --> 20:14.481
How should I know
where your wife is?

20:14.481 --> 20:16.316
I'm the guy
with the Jeep.

20:16.316 --> 20:17.784
You gave
my wife a ride.

20:17.784 --> 20:19.218
You were supposed to drop
her off at Belle's diner.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.620
Not me. Sorry.

20:20.620 --> 20:22.088
Wait a minute.
What do you mean, sorry?

20:22.088 --> 20:24.857
It's like half an hour ago.
You don't remember?

20:24.857 --> 20:28.995
Mister, I've never seen you
before in my life.

20:32.198 --> 20:33.566
What are you doing?

20:36.168 --> 20:37.937
Amy?

20:40.440 --> 20:42.509
Amy, are you in there?

20:43.843 --> 20:46.379
Look, mister, I don't
know what you want--

20:46.379 --> 20:48.648
I want my wife back
is what I want.

20:48.648 --> 20:50.650
Now, what have you done--

20:55.855 --> 20:57.890
( siren )
Hey!

20:58.958 --> 21:02.362
Officer! Officer,
I need your help here.

21:02.362 --> 21:04.196
What's the problem?
I don't know.

21:04.196 --> 21:06.232
I think this guy's
done something
with my wife.

21:06.232 --> 21:08.501
All right, calm down, sir.
Tell me what's going on.

21:08.501 --> 21:10.102
I don't know what
the hell's going on.

21:10.102 --> 21:13.105
The last time I saw her,
she was with this guy
in his truck.

21:13.105 --> 21:15.207
Now he's saying
he's never seen her.

21:15.207 --> 21:17.577
Officer--Officer,
I don't know what's
he's talking about.

21:17.577 --> 21:18.811
Don't lie,
you son of a bitch!

21:18.811 --> 21:20.447
All right,
all right, calm down.

21:20.447 --> 21:22.148
All right,
now tell me exactly
what happened, sir.

21:22.148 --> 21:24.651
OK, all right.

21:24.651 --> 21:26.653
Our car broke down.

21:26.653 --> 21:29.288
Now, he stopped,
offered to help,

21:29.288 --> 21:31.223
took my wife
to a pay phone,

21:31.223 --> 21:33.693
but she never
showed up.

21:33.693 --> 21:36.429
Sir, what do you
have to say about this?

21:36.429 --> 21:38.164
Officer,
I don't know.

21:38.164 --> 21:39.566
I'm driving along,

21:39.566 --> 21:41.468
this fella runs me
off the road,

21:41.468 --> 21:42.902
starts hollering
about his wife.

21:42.902 --> 21:45.872
I swear I've never
seen him before
in my life.

21:45.872 --> 21:47.474
And you didn't
give his wife a ride?

21:47.474 --> 21:50.643
No, sir.
He's lying!

21:53.380 --> 21:56.583
Sir, would it be
all right with you
if I search your truck?

21:56.583 --> 21:58.551
Hell, yes, go ahead.

21:58.551 --> 22:01.120
Name's Barr,
by the way.
Red Barr.

22:01.120 --> 22:03.155
All my permits
are current. You
can see them--

22:03.155 --> 22:06.593
That won't be necessary.
Just stand back behind
the line, both of you.

22:45.632 --> 22:48.835
I need to see
your license and
registration, please.

23:11.791 --> 23:13.359
Those yours?

23:13.359 --> 23:15.127
Yeah.

23:15.127 --> 23:16.496
My, uh, personal stuff.

23:16.496 --> 23:18.598
You want
to take a look?

23:23.035 --> 23:24.804
No.

23:24.804 --> 23:27.440
I think we're
pretty much done here.

23:27.440 --> 23:28.875
You're free to go.

23:28.875 --> 23:30.510
Wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Wait a second.

23:30.510 --> 23:31.944
That's it?
You're not going to
question him anymore?

23:31.944 --> 23:33.680
Sir, I've
searched the truck.

23:33.680 --> 23:35.548
There's no evidence of
suspicious activity here,

23:35.548 --> 23:36.949
no sign of a struggle.

23:36.949 --> 23:38.718
Look, I don't mean
to butt in,

23:38.718 --> 23:40.887
but maybe you
confused my truck
with somebody else's.

23:40.887 --> 23:42.388
Go to hell,
you son of a bitch!

23:42.388 --> 23:44.824
Hey! Now,
hold on a second.

23:44.824 --> 23:46.993
You want to get arrested?

23:46.993 --> 23:48.828
Now, the man's
got a point here.

23:48.828 --> 23:50.797
This is a very
plain-looking truck.

23:50.797 --> 23:53.332
A lot of trucks
look just like it.

23:53.332 --> 23:56.435
Maybe you did
get them mixed up.

23:56.435 --> 23:57.904
Hey!

23:57.904 --> 23:59.472
You stay put.

24:10.983 --> 24:12.118
Mr. Taylor.

24:18.024 --> 24:19.559
Come on.

24:23.429 --> 24:25.264
It was him.

24:25.264 --> 24:26.633
It was this truck.

24:26.633 --> 24:28.267
Uh, I can see that.

24:28.267 --> 24:30.570
Did you get
a license plate number
on that truck?

24:30.570 --> 24:32.171
What? No!

24:32.171 --> 24:34.140
How about the information
on that door panel?

24:34.140 --> 24:35.307
You recall any of that?

24:35.307 --> 24:38.545
I wasn't paying attention.
Come on, officer.

24:40.547 --> 24:42.114
Mr. Taylor,
did you, uh,

24:42.114 --> 24:45.217
by any chance,
have a beef with
your wife today?

24:46.452 --> 24:48.955
What has that got to do
with anything?

24:48.955 --> 24:50.957
Well, for starters,
maybe--

24:50.957 --> 24:52.992
Is there a possibility
she could have left you?

24:54.060 --> 24:56.896
I don't--
I don't believe this.

24:56.896 --> 24:58.931
My wife did not leave me.

24:58.931 --> 25:01.033
Mr. Taylor, I've seen it
a hundred times.

25:01.033 --> 25:03.903
You put 2 people
in a car long enough,
they're gonna go at it.

25:03.903 --> 25:05.572
Lovers, married couples,
gay guys.

25:05.572 --> 25:07.439
Hell, I've seen men
dump their women
on the side of the road

25:07.439 --> 25:08.808
and vice versa.

25:08.808 --> 25:12.378
Officer, uh, I'd really
like to stay and help,

25:12.378 --> 25:14.747
but, uh, I got
a long haul to Fresno.

25:14.747 --> 25:15.882
I understand.
Go ahead.

25:15.882 --> 25:17.950
Appreciate
your cooperation.

25:17.950 --> 25:20.953
This is insane.
Officer, please.

25:20.953 --> 25:22.388
I've got
his information,
all right?

25:22.388 --> 25:25.592
If I need to find
him later, I know
where to look.

25:27.059 --> 25:28.628
Sir.

25:31.330 --> 25:34.066
Much obliged.

25:34.066 --> 25:35.802
And, uh...

25:35.802 --> 25:37.136
look, there's
no hard feelings.

25:37.136 --> 25:40.472
I really do hope
you find your wife.

25:40.472 --> 25:41.808
Thanks.

25:47.146 --> 25:48.915
Mr. Taylor, you
want to come with me?

25:48.915 --> 25:51.150
( truck engine starts )

26:19.578 --> 26:21.781
Sir, I believe you
that your wife's missing,
all right?

26:21.781 --> 26:24.283
Now, maybe you got confused
about what kind of truck
she got into,

26:24.283 --> 26:27.219
and maybe you didn't.
The point is,
I'm trying to help.

26:27.219 --> 26:29.555
The town of Brackett's
31 miles back that way.

26:29.555 --> 26:32.291
My deputy's name
is Len Carver.
He's a good man.

26:32.291 --> 26:34.827
He'll help you fill out
all the necessary forms

26:34.827 --> 26:37.363
if you want to report
your wife missing.

26:37.363 --> 26:38.564
( radio static )

26:38.564 --> 26:40.099
MAN: Sheriff,
this is dispatch.

26:40.099 --> 26:41.668
Mrs. Gilbert's locked out of
her trailer again.

26:41.668 --> 26:43.903
Can you help her?

26:43.903 --> 26:46.372
10-4, dispatch.
Tell her I'm on my way.

26:46.372 --> 26:47.439
Will do.

26:47.439 --> 26:49.909
Mr. Taylor,
do yourself a favor.

26:51.510 --> 26:53.312
Go see my deputy.

27:20.840 --> 27:22.074
Is this
a recent picture?

27:22.074 --> 27:24.944
Yes, a couple months old.

27:24.944 --> 27:27.914
She still wear
her hair like this?

27:30.016 --> 27:31.283
Yeah.

27:32.518 --> 27:36.422
Well, we'll certainly
do our best, Mr. Taylor.

27:36.422 --> 27:38.324
You know, there's
over 100,000 people

27:38.324 --> 27:40.693
go missing in this
country every year--

27:40.693 --> 27:44.063
runaways, deadbeat dads,
dropouts,

27:44.063 --> 27:46.198
folks hiding
from the IRS--

27:46.198 --> 27:48.634
all vanishing
without a trace.

27:48.634 --> 27:52.739
We get these kind of
pictures all the time
from all over the place.

27:53.940 --> 27:56.475
I'm not saying that your
wife is one of them.

27:56.475 --> 27:57.877
I sure hope not.

27:57.877 --> 28:00.346
But unless there's
been a ransom demand

28:00.346 --> 28:02.214
or evidence
of forced abduction,

28:02.214 --> 28:04.083
believe me,
the FBI won't even
look at your case

28:04.083 --> 28:06.953
until it's
been 24 hours.

28:06.953 --> 28:11.223
Nonetheless,
we will certainly
keep our eyes peeled.

28:19.698 --> 28:21.067
Mr. Taylor,

28:22.301 --> 28:23.803
why don't you
go back to Belle's,

28:23.803 --> 28:25.371
get a cup of coffee,

28:25.371 --> 28:26.672
wait for your wife?

28:26.672 --> 28:30.442
If anything comes up,
I'll contact you
first thing.

28:30.442 --> 28:32.144
How's that sound?

28:34.346 --> 28:35.882
Yeah.

28:50.662 --> 28:53.199
( country western
music plays )

28:59.038 --> 29:00.940
Did my wife come in?

29:01.874 --> 29:03.242
Didn't see her.

29:03.242 --> 29:05.377
You didn't see her
or she didn't come in?

29:05.377 --> 29:07.046
Look, like I told you
the last time,

29:07.046 --> 29:09.415
maybe she was in
and maybe she wasn't.

29:09.415 --> 29:12.284
All I'm saying is
that I didn't see her.

29:21.293 --> 29:23.629
It ain't none of
my business, mister,

29:23.629 --> 29:25.031
but if I was you,

29:25.031 --> 29:27.399
I'd check
the ladies' room.

29:40.913 --> 29:41.914
( knock on door )

29:41.914 --> 29:44.516
( groaning )
Amy?

29:44.516 --> 29:47.319
Amy!

29:47.319 --> 29:49.455
I'll be right
with you, cowboy.

29:49.455 --> 29:50.756
( vomits )

29:50.756 --> 29:53.359
( door closes )

29:53.359 --> 29:54.927
Ha ha ha.

29:54.927 --> 29:56.162
4.50, James.

29:56.162 --> 29:58.430
Why start trouble, huh?

30:34.700 --> 30:36.568
I want to see
your order slips.

30:36.568 --> 30:37.937
What?

30:37.937 --> 30:39.939
You write
down the names.
I want to see them.

30:39.939 --> 30:41.773
Are you nuts?

30:41.773 --> 30:43.809
I don't have to
show you jack shit!

30:43.809 --> 30:45.912
If my wife
came in here,

30:45.912 --> 30:48.847
then her name's
in that pile.

30:50.716 --> 30:52.018
You calling me a liar?

30:53.986 --> 30:55.587
Let me see these
fucking slips!

31:03.495 --> 31:06.532
Mister, I had just
about enough of you.

31:33.025 --> 31:36.028
( ring )

31:36.028 --> 31:37.296
WOMAN:
Operator.

31:37.296 --> 31:38.764
Operator, give me
the sheriff's office.

31:38.764 --> 31:40.132
One moment, please.

31:40.132 --> 31:42.001
( ring )
Come on.

31:42.001 --> 31:43.102
My name's Billy.

31:43.102 --> 31:45.437
( ring )

31:45.437 --> 31:47.773
You the fella
looking for his wife?

31:47.773 --> 31:49.808
( ring )

31:49.808 --> 31:52.011
Yes.

31:52.011 --> 31:53.645
Yeah.
How'd you know?

31:53.645 --> 31:55.481
Did you see her?

31:55.481 --> 31:57.416
You seen her?

31:57.416 --> 31:59.885
Please, if you know
something, tell me.

31:59.885 --> 32:02.421
Well, uh,
I seen her, maybe.

32:02.421 --> 32:03.855
Where? When?

32:03.855 --> 32:07.793
Inside,
a little while ago.

32:07.793 --> 32:09.628
She came in on a truck.

32:09.628 --> 32:10.629
Right.

32:10.629 --> 32:11.763
A big semi.

32:11.763 --> 32:13.599
Then what?

32:13.599 --> 32:17.469
Well, then she left

32:17.469 --> 32:18.904
on another truck.

32:18.904 --> 32:20.839
With who?

32:20.839 --> 32:22.674
Oh.

32:22.674 --> 32:24.776
With some man.

32:24.776 --> 32:27.479
Well, they think
I'm a dummy, but I ain't.

32:27.479 --> 32:29.982
I'm gonna get my
trucker's license one day.

32:29.982 --> 32:31.617
This is very important.

32:31.617 --> 32:34.820
Did you see where
they took my wife?

32:34.820 --> 32:36.422
Uh-huh.

32:36.422 --> 32:37.256
Uh-huh.

32:37.256 --> 32:40.692
Route 7 north,
up by the river.

32:40.692 --> 32:42.961
By the river?
Where?

32:47.733 --> 32:50.902
Oh, they don't tell me
that kind of thing.

32:50.902 --> 32:52.138
Who doesn't?

32:52.138 --> 32:53.739
The bartender?

32:53.739 --> 32:55.707
The man in the truck?

32:55.707 --> 32:58.644
Oh, I ain't talkin'
to you no more.

32:58.644 --> 33:00.646
You need to come
with me to the police.

33:00.646 --> 33:04.016
You tell them
what you saw,
they can help me.

33:04.016 --> 33:06.252
Well, now you the dummy.

33:06.252 --> 33:09.155
What's that
supposed to mean?

33:09.155 --> 33:11.157
Well, don't you get it?

33:11.157 --> 33:13.725
The police is
the ones in on it.

33:28.640 --> 33:29.841
( beep )

33:29.841 --> 33:32.111
Come on, work,
goddamn it.

33:39.051 --> 33:40.552
( ring )

33:40.552 --> 33:43.622
Hello? Yeah, Steve?
This is Jeffrey Taylor.

33:43.622 --> 33:45.124
You remember--Right.

33:45.124 --> 33:47.126
Don't put me
on hold, please!

33:47.126 --> 33:48.894
Listen, I need a favor.

33:48.894 --> 33:52.064
I got to talk to that
friend of yours at the FBI.

33:52.064 --> 33:55.334
Right. Uh, it's about Amy.

33:55.334 --> 33:57.136
Something's
happened to--

33:57.136 --> 33:59.538
Amy--yeah, I think
she's been--she's missing.
I think she's--

33:59.538 --> 34:01.307
( voice distorted )

34:01.307 --> 34:03.342
Fuck.
( beep )

34:04.843 --> 34:06.011
( ring )

34:06.011 --> 34:07.313
Hello? Steve?

34:07.313 --> 34:10.116
Yeah. No! No,
don't call me back.

34:10.116 --> 34:11.617
Don't, Steve!

34:11.617 --> 34:13.418
Steve!

34:13.418 --> 34:15.087
( beep )

34:19.757 --> 34:21.260
What the--

34:37.976 --> 34:39.445
Get out
of the car, now!

34:39.445 --> 34:40.612
Oh shit.

35:19.651 --> 35:21.387
Aah!

35:35.634 --> 35:38.069
Son of a bitch!

35:38.069 --> 35:40.339
What do you want?

36:30.389 --> 36:32.458
He's getting away!

36:35.661 --> 36:37.863
( gasping )

38:37.182 --> 38:39.084
What the hell
is going on?

38:39.084 --> 38:41.019
Got away,
went down the river.

39:04.376 --> 39:06.712
( winch grinding )

39:17.656 --> 39:21.827
Yeah. We're
pulling it out now.

39:21.827 --> 39:22.761
Careful.

39:22.761 --> 39:24.095
It's gonna
come loose.

39:24.095 --> 39:25.864
I got it.

39:28.333 --> 39:29.435
This is what happens

39:29.435 --> 39:30.836
when you get one
without the other.

39:30.836 --> 39:32.070
Stop worrying.

39:32.070 --> 39:33.472
How the hell are
we gonna explain
this to the boss?

39:33.472 --> 39:35.441
I ain't gonna explain.
( twig snaps )

39:40.746 --> 39:42.080
Hey.

39:42.080 --> 39:43.849
You all right?

39:56.428 --> 39:59.030
Now, according
to your wife,

39:59.030 --> 40:00.699
you got
a good pile of cash

40:00.699 --> 40:01.933
sitting in your
bank account at home.

40:01.933 --> 40:02.901
Is that true?

40:02.901 --> 40:05.771
What? There--
There's some, yeah.

40:05.771 --> 40:08.339
Hmm. Well, some
just don't cut it.

40:08.339 --> 40:10.509
She gave us
an exact dollar amount.

40:10.509 --> 40:13.111
Now, I want that
same figure from you.

40:13.111 --> 40:15.981
I don't--

40:15.981 --> 40:17.949
There's
different accounts.

40:17.949 --> 40:19.284
Balance fluctuates.
I don't--

40:19.284 --> 40:20.786
Fluctuates, my ass.

40:20.786 --> 40:23.288
If some hotshot fuck like you

40:23.288 --> 40:24.523
ain't watching
his bottom line,

40:24.523 --> 40:27.158
it'd be the
first time in history.

40:29.528 --> 40:31.463
What do you
think, Earl?

40:31.463 --> 40:33.431
What I think is
we've been lied to.

40:33.431 --> 40:35.801
He ain't no goddamn
donut king.

40:35.801 --> 40:38.937
The slut was lying
to save her ass.

40:38.937 --> 40:39.738
Piece of shit.

40:39.738 --> 40:42.474
Please, don't. 90,000!

40:44.175 --> 40:46.678
$90,000.

40:52.417 --> 40:55.521
Now, you
crawl your ass
out of there.

41:15.106 --> 41:17.475
You're a tough man
to get a-hold of,
Jeffrey.

41:18.577 --> 41:19.878
What do you want?

41:19.878 --> 41:22.581
Heh. It's not
what I want.

41:22.581 --> 41:23.849
It's what you want.

41:23.849 --> 41:25.517
How bad
do you want it?

41:25.517 --> 41:27.753
'Cause it is
gonna cost you.

41:27.753 --> 41:29.655
Can't show it
to you right now,

41:29.655 --> 41:32.190
but it's about 5'5",
115 pounds,

41:32.190 --> 41:34.560
three or four of that
just pure tit.

41:34.560 --> 41:38.496
Nice curly brown hair,
upstairs and down.

41:38.496 --> 41:40.031
( gun cocks )

41:40.031 --> 41:42.133
Interested?

41:42.133 --> 41:44.202
Why?

41:44.202 --> 41:45.203
What does--

41:45.203 --> 41:47.138
Why--Why us?

41:48.506 --> 41:50.008
Bring him up here.

42:00.586 --> 42:02.153
Town of Brackett,
Jeff...

42:03.288 --> 42:06.792
Two-bit shit hole
in the middle of nowhere.

42:06.792 --> 42:08.293
See the bank down there?

42:11.096 --> 42:12.631
Few minutes, you're
going to walk in,

42:12.631 --> 42:14.399
tell the manager you
want an express wire

42:14.399 --> 42:15.834
in the amount
of $90,000

42:15.834 --> 42:17.535
from your
bank account
in Boston...

42:17.535 --> 42:19.605
Cash.

42:22.107 --> 42:24.910
How do I know
she's still alive?

42:24.910 --> 42:26.111
Shut up!

42:30.115 --> 42:31.717
Come on, Jeff.

42:31.717 --> 42:34.052
Need you
to pay attention.

42:37.856 --> 42:39.157
Now you see
that building

42:39.157 --> 42:42.193
with the flagpole
coming out
the top of it?

42:42.193 --> 42:43.161
Yeah.

42:43.161 --> 42:45.063
That's
the sheriff's station.

42:45.063 --> 42:46.732
There's exactly
2 cops in this town.

42:46.732 --> 42:48.333
One of them's pulling
desk duty right now.

42:48.333 --> 42:50.468
The other one's
on patrol
in the foothills.

42:50.468 --> 42:52.170
About a minute ago,
Billy here

42:52.170 --> 42:55.707
called in an accident
on the I-40 connector.

42:56.608 --> 42:57.743
See?

42:57.743 --> 43:00.879
There he goes.

43:00.879 --> 43:02.914
It's gonna take
about 20 minutes

43:02.914 --> 43:04.549
for that cracker to get
out to the connector,

43:04.549 --> 43:06.517
another 10 minutes
to see there's
no accident,

43:06.517 --> 43:08.553
another 20 minutes
to get back in.
That's 50 minutes.

43:08.553 --> 43:10.588
That is exactly
the amount of time
you have

43:10.588 --> 43:12.791
to get me my money.

43:17.763 --> 43:19.898
Now before you get
any half-baked ideas

43:19.898 --> 43:21.199
about calling in
the cavalry,

43:21.199 --> 43:23.201
just remember, we're
gonna be watching you

43:23.201 --> 43:24.636
every step of the way,

43:24.636 --> 43:27.839
and we're
gonna be listening
on those scanners,

43:27.839 --> 43:30.776
and if we see
anything unusual--

43:30.776 --> 43:32.610
an unmarked car
or plane,

43:32.610 --> 43:36.214
one human being who even
smells like a cop--

43:36.214 --> 43:39.417
Well, you can
just keep your
fucking money, Jeff,

43:39.417 --> 43:43.254
and I'll send you
pieces of her
from time to time.

43:46.191 --> 43:48.326
Billy...

43:48.326 --> 43:49.728
give him the jacket.

43:53.098 --> 43:54.966
Well, go on,
put it on, Jeff.

43:54.966 --> 43:58.036
Can't go into a bank
looking like that,
now, can you?

44:00.438 --> 44:02.007
We don't have
to do this,

44:02.007 --> 44:04.876
because I can
get you that money,
I swear to God.

44:04.876 --> 44:09.514
I promise you.
Just let my wife go,
please.

44:09.514 --> 44:11.917
49 minutes, Jeff.

44:11.917 --> 44:14.119
Time to get the show
on the road.

45:07.773 --> 45:09.507
Here's my
driver's license,

45:09.507 --> 45:12.077
credit card,
if you need it,

45:12.077 --> 45:14.179
account number from
my bank in Boston.

45:14.179 --> 45:15.814
How long is this
gonna take?

45:15.814 --> 45:18.149
Um, uh, are you,
um, all right?

45:18.149 --> 45:21.486
Yeah, I'm fine. I've only got
$5,000 in that account.

45:21.486 --> 45:23.955
How much
can you advance me
on my credit card?

45:23.955 --> 45:25.824
Heh heh. Excuse me?

45:25.824 --> 45:27.225
Credit card. It's
got a $6,000 limit.

45:27.225 --> 45:28.894
Can you advance me
the whole 6,000?

45:28.894 --> 45:31.229
Uh, no.
I--Sorry, I can't.

45:31.229 --> 45:35.366
The, uh, limit
for noncustomers
is $500 a day.

45:37.135 --> 45:41.973
Sir, are you sure
you're all right?

45:41.973 --> 45:44.575
Yeah, I'm fine.

45:44.575 --> 45:48.046
Just transfer
the money, OK?

46:07.732 --> 46:09.367
I'm gonna tell you
something.

46:12.270 --> 46:15.173
What I'm
about to tell you...

46:16.307 --> 46:18.944
You can't call anyone.
Do you understand?

46:20.545 --> 46:22.113
Yes.

46:23.248 --> 46:25.150
Whatever happens,
just...

46:25.150 --> 46:28.753
Just keep writing
on that pad.

46:28.753 --> 46:31.222
Please, now,
just keep writing.

46:33.992 --> 46:35.293
They're probably
watching me right now.

46:35.293 --> 46:37.662
They--They've got
police scanners.

46:37.662 --> 46:41.032
The whole town's
under surveillance.

46:43.268 --> 46:48.073
If I don't walk
out of here with...

46:48.073 --> 46:50.508
Excuse me.
You the manager?

46:50.508 --> 46:52.277
Yes, I am.

46:52.277 --> 46:54.880
Lady back there
said I should see you
about a car loan.

46:54.880 --> 46:57.148
Certainly, uh...

46:57.148 --> 47:00.451
If, uh, you would
just, uh, take a seat.

47:12.463 --> 47:13.598
Yes?

47:22.707 --> 47:24.275
Just, uh...

47:24.275 --> 47:25.343
F-f-forget it.

47:25.343 --> 47:26.945
I--I, uh, had
a car accident,

47:26.945 --> 47:29.847
you know,
a minor acc--

47:29.847 --> 47:32.350
I'm just kinda...

47:32.350 --> 47:35.420
How long is this
gonna take?

47:35.420 --> 47:37.088
It'll, um...

47:37.088 --> 47:39.958
Well, it's going
to take a few minutes.

47:49.000 --> 47:50.401
Yeah, I am...

47:50.401 --> 47:53.271
calling regarding
account number

47:53.271 --> 47:58.409
9825-8103.

47:58.409 --> 47:59.978
Jeffrey Taylor.

48:02.480 --> 48:04.115
Uh-huh.

48:49.627 --> 48:52.463
( breathing heavily )

50:05.536 --> 50:08.206
( telephone rings )

50:10.841 --> 50:13.478
( ring )

50:16.781 --> 50:19.417
( ring )

50:22.753 --> 50:25.190
( ring )

50:28.459 --> 50:31.062
( ring )

50:33.864 --> 50:35.300
( ring )

50:39.670 --> 50:41.038
It's me.

50:41.038 --> 50:45.576
RED: No shit
I can see that.
How much you got?

50:48.413 --> 50:51.249
The whole thing,
90,000.

50:51.249 --> 50:52.550
That's good.

50:52.550 --> 50:53.818
Now, I want you
to turn left,

50:53.818 --> 50:55.520
start walking
toward the main road,

50:55.520 --> 50:59.624
and get in the first car
that stops. You got that?

50:59.624 --> 51:01.426
When do I see my wife?

51:01.426 --> 51:03.894
Soon enough, Jeff.
Just start walking.

51:03.894 --> 51:06.431
( dial tone )

51:11.836 --> 51:14.572
( crossing bells ringing )

52:17.067 --> 52:18.068
Just throw the money

52:18.068 --> 52:20.238
right up here
on the seat.

52:20.238 --> 52:23.174
No. First you
tell me where she is.

52:23.174 --> 52:25.376
Wrong, asshole.
First you give me
the money,

52:25.376 --> 52:27.312
and then
you find out,

52:27.312 --> 52:29.480
unless you want me just
to shoot your ass dead

52:29.480 --> 52:31.782
right here on the side
of the highway.

52:50.000 --> 52:51.836
Turn around.

52:53.838 --> 52:54.939
Do it!

53:01.879 --> 53:05.015
Put your hands
behind you.

53:05.015 --> 53:06.951
Step toward
the truck.

53:17.562 --> 53:20.431
Now get up in the truck,
on your knees.

53:20.431 --> 53:22.600
Get in here,
goddamn it.

53:41.218 --> 53:44.188
I gave you the money.
Now let her go.

53:44.188 --> 53:47.024
( chuckles )

53:47.024 --> 53:48.559
What the hell do-- Aah!

53:49.794 --> 53:52.830
( panting )

53:52.830 --> 53:54.499
( telephone rings )

53:57.602 --> 53:59.236
Yeah?

53:59.236 --> 54:01.806
Yeah, it's a done deal.

54:01.806 --> 54:03.374
I'm heading in.

54:03.374 --> 54:05.310
Yeah, I got you.

54:07.878 --> 54:09.480
( beeps )

54:12.016 --> 54:14.652
You got to be the
dumbest motherfucker yet.

54:14.652 --> 54:17.855
We just picked you
out of the clear blue.

54:19.390 --> 54:21.892
Shiny new car,

54:21.892 --> 54:23.694
Massachusetts plates,

54:23.694 --> 54:26.464
probably be a week
before anybody
even misses you.

54:26.464 --> 54:30.901
Should've got that
bumper sticker that
goes with that car--

54:30.901 --> 54:34.905
"Rich assholes,
looking for trouble."

54:48.853 --> 54:50.054
Ha ha ha.

54:50.054 --> 54:51.622
Sure wish
I'd been there,

54:51.622 --> 54:52.823
see the look
on your face

54:52.823 --> 54:54.759
when your car
seized up on you.

54:54.759 --> 54:56.661
Maybe next time
you'll learn.

54:56.661 --> 54:59.830
Don't leave your hood open
when you go in the store.

55:17.415 --> 55:18.716
What the hell is that?

55:22.587 --> 55:24.389
These ain't nothing
but goddamn singles!

55:24.389 --> 55:25.890
You lying son of a--

55:25.890 --> 55:27.324
Aah!

55:33.898 --> 55:35.332
( gunshot )

56:13.303 --> 56:15.039
Shit!

56:15.039 --> 56:16.741
Aah!

56:26.383 --> 56:27.752
Hey!

56:27.752 --> 56:29.487
What are you
doing in there?

56:32.857 --> 56:34.559
Hey!

56:36.561 --> 56:38.796
Where is she?

56:38.796 --> 56:39.830
Fuck you.

56:39.830 --> 56:41.131
No, fuck you!

56:41.131 --> 56:42.399
Uhh!

56:42.399 --> 56:44.435
You like that?
How about this?

56:47.371 --> 56:49.807
Where is she?!
I don't know.

56:49.807 --> 56:51.776
The fuck you don't know.

56:55.980 --> 56:58.115
St-stop.

56:58.115 --> 56:59.283
What's that?

56:59.283 --> 57:01.051
You want me to stop?
You really
want me to stop?

57:01.051 --> 57:03.888
'Cause I'll bet
this baby stops
on a fucking dime.

57:18.503 --> 57:20.471
What the hell?

57:26.410 --> 57:27.878
( siren blaring )

57:27.878 --> 57:30.080
Where is she?!
She's with Billy.

57:30.080 --> 57:32.817
Where?
I don't know, man,
driving around.

57:34.952 --> 57:38.589
I'm in pursuit of a black
ford F-150 pickup truck.

57:38.589 --> 57:39.824
Contact the state police.

57:39.824 --> 57:42.026
We're headed northbound,
Highway 31.

57:42.026 --> 57:44.028
I need backup--
Repeat, backup.

57:44.028 --> 57:46.230
Where are you
taking the money?

57:46.230 --> 57:47.364
To the truck stop.

57:47.364 --> 57:48.699
Where? Exactly. Where?

57:48.699 --> 57:51.502
On the main highway,
the Texaco.

57:55.205 --> 57:57.675
Son of a bitch!

57:57.675 --> 57:59.276
Officer! Officer,
you gotta help me!

57:59.276 --> 58:00.377
My wife's
been kidnapped.

58:00.377 --> 58:02.179
Drop the gun!
Whoa, wait.

58:02.179 --> 58:03.280
Get down!

58:03.280 --> 58:04.615
I know where she is.

58:04.615 --> 58:06.951
Get down on the
ground! Do it!

58:06.951 --> 58:10.087
All right, I'm down.
Listen to me. He's in on it.

58:10.087 --> 58:12.289
He's with the trucker.
They kidnapped my wife.

58:12.289 --> 58:14.358
There's 4 of them.
They all work together.

58:14.358 --> 58:16.026
They got her right now
at a truck stop, the Texaco--

58:16.026 --> 58:20.731
Face down! Shut up!
You in the pickup,
you all right?

58:20.731 --> 58:22.199
Please, you've
got to believe me.

58:22.199 --> 58:23.568
Can you hear me?
Why else would
I be out here?

58:23.568 --> 58:25.202
Yes, sir. I'm OK.

58:25.202 --> 58:26.671
Can you get out?
Help me, goddamn it.

58:26.671 --> 58:28.138
Yes, I can.
Please don't shoot me.

58:28.138 --> 58:29.874
Look in the cab.
There's a bag with money,

58:29.874 --> 58:31.508
and I swear to god,
it's right in there.

58:31.508 --> 58:34.211
Face down, spread-eagle,
and shut up!

58:35.713 --> 58:37.414
Get out, damn it!
We have to get
to the truck stop.

58:37.414 --> 58:40.117
Goddamn it, listen to what
I'm telling you!

58:40.117 --> 58:41.552
Shut the fuck up!

58:41.552 --> 58:42.920
Unh!

58:52.462 --> 58:54.364
Hey, shit for brains.

58:54.364 --> 58:56.000
Ha ha ha.

58:56.000 --> 58:58.002
( gunshot )

59:17.321 --> 59:19.590
Shots fired.

59:20.591 --> 59:22.693
Officer down.

59:27.331 --> 59:29.266
Suspect identified.

59:32.002 --> 59:34.739
RADIO: Sheriff? This
is state police dispatch.

59:34.739 --> 59:37.207
What is your 20?

59:37.207 --> 59:39.744
Get an ambulance.
He's been shot.

59:39.744 --> 59:41.912
Who is this?

59:41.912 --> 59:43.280
Sheriff, can you respond?

59:43.280 --> 59:45.049
They're coming.

59:48.418 --> 59:51.121
Sheriff, hang on.
We're getting you
an ambulance.

59:54.091 --> 59:56.593
All units, all units,
officer down--

59:56.593 --> 59:58.963
Repeat, officer down.

01:01:18.242 --> 01:01:19.744
Look, I don't know,
damn it.

01:01:19.744 --> 01:01:22.079
He was supposed to be here
a half an hour ago,

01:01:22.079 --> 01:01:25.750
and I heard a report
on the police band
about a cop down.

01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:28.418
I'm leaving. I can't--
There's too much
heat around here.

01:01:28.418 --> 01:01:29.920
So stay off
the airwaves,

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:32.322
get his wife, and
meet me at the barn.

01:01:32.322 --> 01:01:34.792
I don't care if we
have to drive all night.

01:05:27.357 --> 01:05:29.059
( horn honks )

01:05:35.165 --> 01:05:36.733
Daddy, you're home!

01:05:36.733 --> 01:05:38.568
Hey, Deke.
Miss me?

01:05:38.568 --> 01:05:39.569
Yeah.

01:05:39.569 --> 01:05:40.770
Deke, get back to bed.

01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:43.340
Warren, I thought
you were coming back
next week.

01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:46.376
Yeah. Well,
I finished early,
and now I'm home.

01:05:46.376 --> 01:05:48.512
Al and Billy are
coming over in
a little while, too.

01:05:48.512 --> 01:05:51.448
But it's 6:00 in
the morning. Can't they
come some other time?

01:05:51.448 --> 01:05:53.250
Look, we got some
stuff to do, OK?

01:05:53.250 --> 01:05:54.985
It's gonna take
a couple of hours.

01:05:54.985 --> 01:05:56.720
Why don't you go in
and make breakfast.

01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:58.922
Hey, Deke!
Yeah?

01:05:58.922 --> 01:06:00.557
Want to open the
barn for your dad?

01:06:00.557 --> 01:06:02.092
OK.

01:06:33.290 --> 01:06:36.193
Hey, hey, Dekey.
Hey, thanks.

01:06:36.193 --> 01:06:37.694
Hey, I got
something for you.

01:06:37.694 --> 01:06:38.862
Ready?

01:06:38.862 --> 01:06:40.130
Hmm?

01:06:40.130 --> 01:06:41.765
Here you go, son.

01:06:41.765 --> 01:06:42.932
Look at that.

01:06:42.932 --> 01:06:44.000
Cool.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.669
Cool. Heh heh.

01:06:45.669 --> 01:06:48.138
Real Swiss Army knife.

01:06:48.138 --> 01:06:49.639
Good boy.

01:07:07.891 --> 01:07:09.493
( grunts )

01:07:31.381 --> 01:07:33.283
Deke?

01:07:34.884 --> 01:07:37.321
Deke, you back there?

01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:34.470
Man, if I never see
another couple
from Massachusetts,

01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:35.805
it'll be too soon.

01:09:35.805 --> 01:09:38.442
Yeah. OK, OK. We got
a lot of work to do.

01:09:38.442 --> 01:09:39.908
First off,
you got any word on Earl?

01:09:39.908 --> 01:09:41.044
Not a thing.

01:09:41.044 --> 01:09:42.845
Me neither.
Fuck.

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:44.913
OK, we gotta get
the stuff off the truck.

01:09:44.913 --> 01:09:48.285
Now, anything that can
trace us back to that fuck,
we get rid of.

01:09:48.285 --> 01:09:50.453
Anything, Billy.
You got that?

01:09:50.453 --> 01:09:54.858
( unlatches
and rolls up gate )

01:09:57.861 --> 01:09:59.663
You know, none of this
would've happened

01:09:59.663 --> 01:10:01.898
if you'd gotten that jerk
the same time as his wife.

01:10:01.898 --> 01:10:04.501
He wouldn't get
in the fucking truck.

01:10:04.501 --> 01:10:06.069
I suppose you'd
just pick up a gun

01:10:06.069 --> 01:10:07.637
and chase him out
into the desert.

01:10:07.637 --> 01:10:09.539
Fucking idiot.
Look, I'm just saying.

01:10:09.539 --> 01:10:10.840
You should've
gotten rid of him

01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:12.809
just like that couple
in Ohio. Nice and clean.

01:10:12.809 --> 01:10:15.579
So we stay out of the area
for a couple of months.

01:10:15.579 --> 01:10:18.081
Big deal.

01:10:18.081 --> 01:10:19.082
Al!

01:10:19.082 --> 01:10:20.250
Yeah?

01:10:20.250 --> 01:10:21.718
Come on!

01:10:26.690 --> 01:10:30.193
All right, honey,
time to get up.

01:10:30.193 --> 01:10:31.495
Let's go! Come on.
Come on.

01:10:31.495 --> 01:10:34.163
Come on! Move it!

01:10:34.163 --> 01:10:35.665
RED: Get up!

01:10:37.267 --> 01:10:38.802
Dead?

01:10:38.802 --> 01:10:41.305
Must've died
from the exhaust, huh?

01:10:41.305 --> 01:10:43.640
Suicide. Ha ha ha.

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:47.110
Couldn't be any cleaner
than that, now, could you?

01:10:47.110 --> 01:10:48.345
Get that plastic, man.

01:10:48.345 --> 01:10:50.079
We'll bury her
out back before sunup.

01:10:50.079 --> 01:10:51.781
All right, come on,
let's go.

01:10:51.781 --> 01:10:53.883
( grunts )

01:10:53.883 --> 01:10:55.819
You got it?
Yeah.

01:10:55.819 --> 01:10:56.986
Come on.

01:10:59.956 --> 01:11:00.957
Ohh!

01:11:00.957 --> 01:11:02.892
AL: Goddamn!

01:11:02.892 --> 01:11:03.893
( laughing )

01:11:03.893 --> 01:11:06.396
Scared me half to death!

01:11:07.797 --> 01:11:09.399
I'll cut her head off
right now.

01:11:09.399 --> 01:11:11.335
ARLEEN: Warren,
you in there?

01:11:11.335 --> 01:11:12.669
Shh. It's my wife.
Come on.

01:11:12.669 --> 01:11:14.904
Cover her up quick.
Put her in the freezer.

01:11:14.904 --> 01:11:15.772
ARLEEN: Warren?!

01:11:15.772 --> 01:11:18.375
RED: Be right there,
Arleen.

01:11:18.375 --> 01:11:20.577
( Amy grunting )

01:11:34.958 --> 01:11:35.925
Damn.

01:11:35.925 --> 01:11:38.462
She's a feisty one,
ain't she?

01:11:40.364 --> 01:11:43.567
That's right, lady.
You just keep it up.

01:11:49.973 --> 01:11:51.441
( trapdoor opens )

01:11:51.441 --> 01:11:53.810
All right.
Don't give me any trouble.

01:11:53.810 --> 01:11:56.346
Damn it! Cut your
fucking squirming!

01:11:56.346 --> 01:11:57.814
Aw, come on, baby.

01:11:57.814 --> 01:11:59.649
It's not as bad
as it sounds.

01:11:59.649 --> 01:12:01.851
Take you about 10 minutes
to suck all that air out.

01:12:01.851 --> 01:12:03.587
Probably won't
even feel it.

01:12:11.294 --> 01:12:13.530
Come on, fellas.
Come on.

01:12:13.530 --> 01:12:15.532
Come on, hurry.

01:12:18.468 --> 01:12:19.969
BILLY: Let's go eat!

01:12:31.247 --> 01:12:32.248
Well--

01:12:32.248 --> 01:12:33.517
BILLY: Hey, Mrs. B.

01:12:33.517 --> 01:12:34.518
ARLEEN: Finally.

01:12:34.518 --> 01:12:36.119
Are you coming
to breakfast?

01:12:36.119 --> 01:12:37.554
I've been calling you.

01:12:37.554 --> 01:12:40.524
BILLY: Yeah,
I sure could use
some of them pancakes.

01:13:12.088 --> 01:13:13.457
AL: Hey, Billy!

01:13:13.457 --> 01:13:14.924
BILLY: I'm coming, al!

01:13:56.700 --> 01:13:59.836
( breathing heavily )

01:14:47.483 --> 01:14:48.552
( machine-gun noises
from TV )

01:14:48.552 --> 01:14:50.019
( men laughing )

01:15:06.670 --> 01:15:09.906
( door softly creaking )

01:15:09.906 --> 01:15:12.408
Huge. Thing must've
been about 10 pounds.

01:15:12.408 --> 01:15:13.743
Starts reaching out.

01:15:15.344 --> 01:15:16.780
( Al chuckling )

01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:19.649
Reaches way out...

01:15:23.286 --> 01:15:25.989
Give me the key.

01:15:25.989 --> 01:15:27.123
Mister.

01:15:27.123 --> 01:15:29.659
Don't mister me,
you son of a bitch.

01:15:29.659 --> 01:15:31.561
My wife is locked up
in a hole

01:15:31.561 --> 01:15:32.862
in your fucking barn,

01:15:32.862 --> 01:15:34.798
and if you don't
give me the key,

01:15:34.798 --> 01:15:36.966
I'm gonna blow
your fucking head off!

01:15:36.966 --> 01:15:38.167
Warren, what's going on?

01:15:38.167 --> 01:15:40.136
I don't know, honey.
Just stay calm.

01:15:40.136 --> 01:15:42.639
Your husband's
a murderer
and a kidnapper.

01:15:42.639 --> 01:15:44.507
Now, give me
the fucking key!

01:15:44.507 --> 01:15:46.576
Freeze, mister.

01:15:52.616 --> 01:15:54.684
You don't want
to do that, kid.

01:15:55.551 --> 01:15:56.586
Put the gun down.

01:15:56.586 --> 01:15:58.688
Don't listen to him,
Deke.

01:15:58.688 --> 01:16:00.824
Just keep that gun
right on him.

01:16:02.558 --> 01:16:04.994
My daddy keeps his rifle
loaded all the time.

01:16:04.994 --> 01:16:08.197
He showed me in case
I need to protect mommy
when he's away.

01:16:08.197 --> 01:16:10.433
I understand that,
and I'm not gonna hurt
your mom.

01:16:10.433 --> 01:16:12.736
He's lying, Deke.

01:16:12.736 --> 01:16:15.605
Now, go on, son.

01:16:15.605 --> 01:16:18.041
Squeeze that trigger.
Go on.

01:16:18.041 --> 01:16:20.076
Don't listen to him,
kid.

01:16:20.076 --> 01:16:21.077
Go on, Deke.

01:16:21.077 --> 01:16:22.712
Don't listen to him.
He's wrong.

01:16:22.712 --> 01:16:25.248
Do what I tell you to do.
Squeeze that trigger.
Now, come on!

01:16:25.248 --> 01:16:27.050
Put it down, Deke.

01:16:27.050 --> 01:16:28.752
Nothing's
gonna happen.

01:16:30.887 --> 01:16:32.355
Do it!

01:16:32.355 --> 01:16:34.157
Aah!

01:16:36.392 --> 01:16:37.894
Don't move.

01:16:40.664 --> 01:16:42.932
Nobody move!

01:16:42.932 --> 01:16:45.935
Get out here, kid.
Get over here.
Get by your mom.

01:16:45.935 --> 01:16:49.538
Here, hon.
It's all right.

01:16:49.538 --> 01:16:51.107
Get over there.

01:16:51.107 --> 01:16:52.208
Get over there!

01:16:54.010 --> 01:16:55.278
Shit!

01:16:57.580 --> 01:16:59.015
All right.

01:17:00.416 --> 01:17:03.386
Everybody stick together
and get out that door.
Right now!

01:17:03.386 --> 01:17:05.254
Move it! Go!
Get out of here!

01:17:05.254 --> 01:17:07.523
Move it! Turn around!

01:17:07.523 --> 01:17:09.258
Turn around!

01:17:14.330 --> 01:17:16.099
Open it.

01:17:27.510 --> 01:17:28.878
All right.

01:17:28.878 --> 01:17:31.080
Get down there and
open that freezer up.

01:17:33.516 --> 01:17:34.984
Warren, what is this?

01:17:34.984 --> 01:17:37.787
Just pull the chain,
Arleen.

01:17:44.127 --> 01:17:45.895
Open it!

01:17:48.564 --> 01:17:50.834
( lock jingling )

01:17:50.834 --> 01:17:52.836
You better pray...

01:17:52.836 --> 01:17:54.904
she's alive.

01:17:58.074 --> 01:18:00.309
Oh!

01:18:00.309 --> 01:18:02.445
Amy.

01:18:02.445 --> 01:18:04.213
Jeff.

01:18:05.949 --> 01:18:08.484
You made it, baby.
Come on.

01:18:08.484 --> 01:18:10.019
Get away from me!
Aah!

01:18:11.487 --> 01:18:13.422
Come on, honey.
Come on up.

01:18:13.422 --> 01:18:15.358
Come on, honey.

01:18:15.358 --> 01:18:16.559
Oh.

01:18:16.559 --> 01:18:18.227
It's all right.

01:18:20.296 --> 01:18:22.732
All right,
you son of a bitch,
get down there!

01:18:22.732 --> 01:18:25.234
All of you!
Get down there!

01:18:26.736 --> 01:18:28.104
It's OK.

01:18:31.741 --> 01:18:33.009
It's all right.

01:18:33.009 --> 01:18:34.911
You better
remember this,
fella,

01:18:34.911 --> 01:18:36.212
'cause no matter
where you go--

01:18:36.212 --> 01:18:37.413
you!

01:18:46.455 --> 01:18:48.858
Jeff! Jeff!

01:18:48.858 --> 01:18:50.293
It's all right.

01:18:50.293 --> 01:18:51.294
It's all right.

01:18:51.294 --> 01:18:52.395
Now, listen to me.

01:18:52.395 --> 01:18:55.098
Amy, listen to me.
Honey, listen to me.

01:18:55.098 --> 01:18:56.499
There's one more
still out there.

01:18:56.499 --> 01:18:58.034
Do you understand?

01:18:59.102 --> 01:19:01.304
And we have to get out
of here fast.

01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:12.248
Damn it.

01:19:14.784 --> 01:19:16.185
Shit.

01:19:27.396 --> 01:19:29.765
Can you make it
to that pickup truck?

01:19:31.067 --> 01:19:32.135
OK.

01:19:32.135 --> 01:19:33.502
Come on.

01:19:54.757 --> 01:19:56.759
Ohh.
OK.

01:19:56.759 --> 01:19:58.027
OK, come here.

01:19:58.027 --> 01:19:59.428
ARLEEN: Help!
RED: Billy!

01:19:59.428 --> 01:20:01.164
ARLEEN: Help!

01:20:09.839 --> 01:20:11.240
We gotta find
those keys.

01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:12.909
OK.

01:20:18.047 --> 01:20:19.782
Hello. Yeah, my name
is Jeffrey Taylor.

01:20:19.782 --> 01:20:23.252
This is an emergency.
Listen to me.
I need the police.

01:20:23.252 --> 01:20:26.122
Someone's trying to kill
me and my wife,
do you understand?

01:20:26.122 --> 01:20:29.458
I don't know the address.
We're on a farm.

01:20:29.458 --> 01:20:31.861
Just start tracing
this call right now!

01:20:33.662 --> 01:20:35.131
Got 'em!

01:20:39.702 --> 01:20:41.137
Jeff!
Get away!

01:20:49.478 --> 01:20:50.546
Come on.

01:20:50.546 --> 01:20:53.249
Come on.

01:20:53.249 --> 01:20:54.483
Oh.

01:20:54.483 --> 01:20:56.085
Give me the keys!

01:21:00.023 --> 01:21:02.525
( breathing heavily )

01:21:02.525 --> 01:21:03.859
Jeff!

01:21:07.696 --> 01:21:09.165
Come on!

01:21:10.399 --> 01:21:11.200
Go!

01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:12.969
( engine starts )

01:21:29.118 --> 01:21:31.187
You see him?

01:21:31.187 --> 01:21:33.356
Do you see him?!
No!

01:21:38.627 --> 01:21:40.196
( gunshot )
Aah!

01:21:45.101 --> 01:21:46.302
Are you all right?

01:21:46.302 --> 01:21:48.537
Yeah.

01:21:48.537 --> 01:21:49.572
Look out!

01:21:49.572 --> 01:21:51.074
Look out!

01:21:51.941 --> 01:21:54.077
Son of a bitch!

01:21:59.182 --> 01:22:01.050
You want some?
Come on!

01:22:04.353 --> 01:22:05.621
Hey!

01:22:06.789 --> 01:22:09.125
AMY: Jeffrey, over here!
Over here!

01:22:11.527 --> 01:22:14.097
( brakes screech )

01:22:15.231 --> 01:22:16.332
Oh!

01:22:20.569 --> 01:22:22.338
( gears grind )

01:22:26.875 --> 01:22:29.778
Oh, my God.
Oh! Watch out!

01:22:29.778 --> 01:22:31.247
Hang on!

01:22:38.954 --> 01:22:40.223
Fuck!

01:22:46.395 --> 01:22:48.431
Fucker!
You're gonna die!

01:22:48.431 --> 01:22:51.100
( horn blaring )

01:22:51.100 --> 01:22:54.103
( gears grinding )

01:22:57.540 --> 01:22:58.674
Oh, god.

01:23:04.613 --> 01:23:06.182
Aah!

01:23:12.021 --> 01:23:13.389
Jeff.

01:23:18.027 --> 01:23:19.662
Oh!

01:23:23.799 --> 01:23:25.000
Shit!

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.702
I'm out.

01:23:44.019 --> 01:23:46.689
Aah! Aah!

01:23:48.757 --> 01:23:50.259
Yeah!

01:23:52.395 --> 01:23:53.496
Jesus!

01:23:53.496 --> 01:23:56.532
No! No! No!

01:23:59.568 --> 01:24:00.703
No!

01:24:05.541 --> 01:24:07.076
( engine revving )

01:24:08.577 --> 01:24:09.845
Go, Jeff!

01:24:09.845 --> 01:24:11.714
( engine revving )

01:24:15.718 --> 01:24:17.220
Oh! I can't get out!

01:24:17.220 --> 01:24:18.287
Gotta get out of here!

01:24:18.287 --> 01:24:20.289
I can't get out!

01:24:20.289 --> 01:24:21.757
My leg is trapped!

01:24:45.481 --> 01:24:47.550
Aah! My leg!

01:24:55.458 --> 01:24:56.792
Aah!

01:24:59.795 --> 01:25:01.130
Aah!

01:25:03.466 --> 01:25:05.601
( windshield crashes below )

01:25:06.935 --> 01:25:08.837
( metal creaks )

01:25:38.066 --> 01:25:39.535
Oh.

01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:46.175
Jeff!

01:26:04.993 --> 01:26:06.595
Aah!

01:26:10.466 --> 01:26:11.934
Aah!

01:26:19.107 --> 01:26:20.175
Aah!

01:26:44.032 --> 01:26:45.868
( grunting )

01:26:47.570 --> 01:26:48.671
Jeff.

01:26:50.105 --> 01:26:52.408
Oh!

01:26:52.408 --> 01:26:53.476
Don't move.

01:26:53.476 --> 01:26:55.644
Don't move.
( sobbing )

01:27:01.517 --> 01:27:02.885
( metal creaking )

01:27:05.153 --> 01:27:06.221
Jeff.

01:27:06.221 --> 01:27:08.857
I'm gonna
get you out, baby.

01:27:08.857 --> 01:27:09.792
Help me.

01:27:09.792 --> 01:27:11.594
Come here.
Come on. Come on.

01:27:11.594 --> 01:27:13.496
All right. We're gonna
do this together.

01:27:13.496 --> 01:27:14.630
Aah!

01:27:16.665 --> 01:27:19.001
Pull! Pull!

01:27:19.001 --> 01:27:21.270
That's it.
Come on! Pull!

01:27:21.270 --> 01:27:23.005
Come on!

01:27:23.005 --> 01:27:24.740
Aah!

01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:27.410
( sobbing )

01:27:30.045 --> 01:27:31.146
You all right?

01:27:31.146 --> 01:27:32.981
Yes.

01:27:32.981 --> 01:27:35.284
Jeff. Ohh.
