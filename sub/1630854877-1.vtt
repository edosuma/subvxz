01:40.720 --> 01:43.890
[Walter McCallister's
frightened breathing]

01:45.560 --> 01:47.210
[Clark] When we take it upon
ourselves

01:47.410 --> 01:50.340
to act against
our best interests.

01:50.540 --> 01:52.630
[Walter McCallister's
frightened breathing]

01:52.830 --> 01:55.190
[Clark] And the best interests
of our community,

01:56.400 --> 01:57.560
we have to understand

01:57.750 --> 02:00.410
that there are consequences
for those actions.

02:01.450 --> 02:05.610
And we must respect
the hierarchy of power

02:05.800 --> 02:07.540
as it is handed down to us
from God.

02:08.580 --> 02:11.940
I did not ask
for this responsibility.

02:12.140 --> 02:15.510
I did rise to power
under my own volition,

02:15.970 --> 02:17.740
but the drive to do so

02:17.940 --> 02:20.590
was placed inside of me
by a higher power.

02:21.930 --> 02:22.850
Jimmy.

02:23.930 --> 02:24.960
- [sniffles]
- [Clark] It's God's will

02:25.160 --> 02:26.560
that I stand here today

02:28.810 --> 02:32.770
take a hard look
at your lives, people.

02:35.280 --> 02:36.470
You believe
that anything happens

02:36.670 --> 02:38.150
without the will of God?

02:38.950 --> 02:40.430
If it were God's will
that he wanted

02:40.630 --> 02:41.640
one of you to be in charge...

02:41.840 --> 02:43.030
Hey, Briggs.

02:44.450 --> 02:46.650
Keep a sharp eye out
for the brother.

02:46.850 --> 02:48.960
Boss thinks
he might try something.

02:49.370 --> 02:50.570
[Clark] He did not.

02:50.770 --> 02:54.650
God blessed me with the means
and the mental fortitude

02:54.850 --> 02:57.410
to grow my interests
in this community.

02:57.610 --> 03:01.200
Not only was I able to open up
Clark's Mercantile and Trade,

03:01.400 --> 03:03.390
but I was able to
lure in the railroad.

03:04.100 --> 03:06.770
Now I know that many of you
do not agree

03:07.310 --> 03:09.230
with my methods.

03:09.770 --> 03:11.380
Let me assure you
Mr. McCallister here's

03:11.580 --> 03:12.550
had every opportunity

03:12.750 --> 03:15.360
to do right by this community,
but he's flat out refused.

03:16.480 --> 03:19.190
Jimmy, you go on home, now.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.390
Don't stay here and watch this.

03:21.590 --> 03:23.030
You hear me, son?

03:23.490 --> 03:25.030
You go on home!

03:25.410 --> 03:26.490
Go!

[window creaks]

03:30.350 --> 03:31.730
"James," is it?

03:31.930 --> 03:34.630
Do you understand
what's happening here today?

03:37.170 --> 03:40.320
Well, your father is
teaching you a valuable lesson.

03:40.520 --> 03:42.800
Go home. Go!

03:44.220 --> 03:45.470
Know your place.

03:48.060 --> 03:49.390
He stole from me.

03:49.890 --> 03:52.480
Yes, he did.
Yes, he did!

03:54.150 --> 03:56.470
He stole from
all these good people.

03:56.670 --> 03:58.380
That makes him a sinner.

03:58.580 --> 04:01.140
You know where in the world
sinners go?

04:01.340 --> 04:02.810
I can tell you.

04:03.010 --> 04:04.870
Sure as hell ain't Wyoming.

04:06.200 --> 04:07.310
[horse neighing]

Let him hang.

[Clark gasping for air]

04:48.620 --> 04:51.660
[gasping for air]
Help... help me.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.190
Get the doc.

04:55.390 --> 04:57.960
[wheezing]

05:04.380 --> 05:06.090
You owe me more.

- Yeah.

05:25.110 --> 05:27.240
Oh, god, no.

05:32.330 --> 05:33.750
Paid in full.

[uplifting music]

06:52.370 --> 06:54.160
[birds chirping]

07:04.460 --> 07:05.400
Get these hung early

07:05.600 --> 07:07.760
so they have a chance to dry
before the wind gets up.

07:11.720 --> 07:13.890
Are you gonna help me
or just keep watching?

07:14.680 --> 07:16.220
[Briggs] I like watching you.

07:18.770 --> 07:21.480
- Yeah? You like
watching me hang laundry?

07:22.100 --> 07:23.590
[giggles]

07:23.790 --> 07:26.630
- I like watching you
do most things.

07:26.830 --> 07:29.100
- Most things I do,
I do for you.

07:29.290 --> 07:30.720
That's true.

07:30.920 --> 07:33.020
- Suppose that might be
why you like watching me?

07:33.220 --> 07:36.690
- I reckon I'd enjoy
watching you do other things.

07:36.890 --> 07:38.620
Not just things for me.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.570
- Like when I do things
for our daughter?

07:42.770 --> 07:46.240
- Yes.
You're a good mother.

07:46.440 --> 07:47.920
Anyone can see that.

07:51.510 --> 07:52.510
Thank you.

08:00.730 --> 08:03.800
Now, I need you to be
a good father today

08:04.000 --> 08:05.690
and walk our daughter to school.

08:06.060 --> 08:08.260
- Oh, no. She's old enough
to walk herself.

08:08.460 --> 08:09.280
She needs you.

08:10.400 --> 08:11.950
I need you.

08:12.700 --> 08:13.760
And I can't walk her today

08:13.960 --> 08:15.220
since the wind is
probably gonna get up

08:15.420 --> 08:17.810
and I need to finish
hanging this laundry.

08:18.010 --> 08:18.980
I have to open the store.

08:19.180 --> 08:21.440
- [soft chuckle] Then the two
of you had best get going

08:21.640 --> 08:22.980
so you're not late.

08:23.180 --> 08:24.370
Brooke!

08:25.330 --> 08:26.240
You need to hurry.

08:26.430 --> 08:28.200
Your father's walking you
to school today.

08:28.400 --> 08:29.740
Why can't you walk me?

08:29.940 --> 08:30.880
Brooke.

08:33.130 --> 08:34.180
Yes, sir?

08:35.970 --> 08:37.260
Listen to your mother.

08:37.800 --> 08:39.170
Thank you.

08:39.360 --> 08:41.210
Brooke, I have too many chores
to get done this morning.

08:41.410 --> 08:42.250
So no arguing.

08:42.450 --> 08:44.880
Grab your school books and scoot
before you're both late.

08:45.080 --> 08:46.760
I think you and your father
could use

08:46.960 --> 08:48.730
a little walk together,
anyway.

08:50.110 --> 08:51.360
Go on.

08:55.820 --> 08:57.950
[perky music]

08:59.530 --> 09:00.810
- We should have
taken the horse.

09:01.010 --> 09:01.850
No.

09:02.050 --> 09:03.360
There wasn't time
to saddle the horse

09:03.560 --> 09:05.360
and walk you to school
and be back at the store

09:05.560 --> 09:06.650
on time to open.

09:06.850 --> 09:08.360
- Wouldn't we be faster
on the horse?

09:08.560 --> 09:09.700
Undoubtedly.

09:09.890 --> 09:11.410
- Then wouldn't the time
we save by being faster

09:11.600 --> 09:13.200
have made up for the time
it would have taken

09:13.400 --> 09:14.590
to saddle the horse?

09:21.680 --> 09:22.810
No.

09:23.140 --> 09:25.190
[perky music continues]

09:48.920 --> 09:50.290

Miss Valerie has taken ill."

10:01.180 --> 10:02.640
What do you think
she's ill with?

10:03.310 --> 10:04.310
Pox?

10:08.400 --> 10:09.590
It's probably pox.

10:09.790 --> 10:12.150
- You need to walk home now.
I have to open the store.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.260
- Mama says I'm not
allowed to walk home alone.

10:15.460 --> 10:17.200
That's nonsense.

10:17.860 --> 10:19.610
- You say I should
listen to Mother.

10:20.910 --> 10:22.450
This is different.

10:23.910 --> 10:26.410
- Mama wouldn't like it
if you made me walk home alone.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.670
[♪♪♪]

10:45.520 --> 10:47.270
[horse neighing]

10:54.780 --> 10:57.190
- Sit there
and finish your studies.

10:57.820 --> 10:58.800
I have finished my studies.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.110
The teacher
needs to assign new ones.

11:01.660 --> 11:04.410
- Then sit there
and read a book.

11:16.510 --> 11:17.710
[door opens]

11:18.760 --> 11:20.120
Good morning, Mr. Jeffries.

11:20.320 --> 11:21.660
- [door closes]
- Good morning, Mr. Briggs!

11:21.860 --> 11:23.140
How's your day?

11:23.340 --> 11:24.890
- Very well.
How can I help you?

11:25.430 --> 11:27.560
- Well, I'll tell you,
Mr. Briggs.

11:28.140 --> 11:30.250
My mother done got it
in her head yesterday

11:30.450 --> 11:31.750
that she wanted to bake a cake

11:31.950 --> 11:33.170
for the church potluck
this weekend.

11:33.370 --> 11:35.340
Now, last year,
she made a pie,

11:35.540 --> 11:37.930
but the apples she used grew
on Mr. Johnson's apple tree,

11:38.130 --> 11:40.680
you know, the one out back
by the outhouse.

11:40.880 --> 11:41.720
And wouldn't you know it,

11:41.920 --> 11:43.310
them apples tasted
plum-like shit

11:43.510 --> 11:45.350
and made anybody who eat 'em
sick to their gut.

11:45.550 --> 11:47.980
I tell ya, I think the shit
from that outhouse

11:48.180 --> 11:49.480
has soaked down to the root

11:49.680 --> 11:52.520
and changed the way
a basic apple can taste.

11:52.720 --> 11:54.820
But Mr. Johnson says
that's a bunch of hooey,

11:55.020 --> 11:56.030
and because of that,

11:56.230 --> 11:58.700
he won't let Mama have no more
apples for her apple pie,

11:58.900 --> 12:00.490
which, as far as
I'm concerned,

12:00.690 --> 12:03.200
is fine by me and Mama
because as I mentioned before,

12:03.400 --> 12:05.640
the apples taste like shit
anyhow.

12:06.010 --> 12:07.010
[exhales]

12:07.850 --> 12:10.980
Well, that left
a dilemma for Mama.

12:12.730 --> 12:15.010
She's not going to bake pie
for this week's potluck.

12:15.210 --> 12:16.690
What could she possibly make?

12:18.020 --> 12:19.390
A cake.

12:19.580 --> 12:22.220
- Exactly. Mama's gonna
bake a cake.

12:22.420 --> 12:24.950
Bring it to the church potluck
after church on Sunday.

12:26.530 --> 12:27.810
- Was there something
that you needed

12:28.010 --> 12:29.600
from the store,
Mr. Jeffries?

12:29.800 --> 12:32.310
- There I go, blundering on
around about Mama.

12:32.510 --> 12:34.530
I done forgot
you don't know why I'm here.

12:34.720 --> 12:36.190
Mama needs some flour.

12:36.390 --> 12:37.740
The sack she has
is full of weevils

12:37.940 --> 12:40.070
and she don't think she can
sift them all out this time.

12:40.270 --> 12:41.410
How many pounds?

12:41.610 --> 12:43.830
- Just a 20-pound bag will do.

12:44.030 --> 12:46.080

13:02.440 --> 13:04.860
I didn't, uh,
I didn't see you there.

13:05.700 --> 13:07.270
I wasn't really gonna steal 'em.

13:07.470 --> 13:08.930
This is a game
I play with your daddy.

13:09.130 --> 13:11.200
[footsteps descending stairs]

13:13.250 --> 13:14.440
Twenty pounds of flour.

13:14.640 --> 13:16.780
That'll be one dollar
and a nickel.

13:16.980 --> 13:17.730
[cash register pings]

13:17.930 --> 13:20.110
- Yeah, could you apply it
to my mother's account?

13:20.310 --> 13:21.550
[Briggs] Of course.

13:21.960 --> 13:23.570
Thank you, Mr. Briggs.

13:23.770 --> 13:26.200
Hope to see you
at the luncheon on Sunday.

13:26.400 --> 13:27.260
Madame.

13:30.600 --> 13:31.850
[door opens]

13:32.050 --> 13:32.960
Have you finished

13:33.160 --> 13:34.430
- reading your book?
- [door closes]

13:34.940 --> 13:37.190
- He tried to steal
some jelly beans.

13:38.810 --> 13:39.670
What?

13:39.870 --> 13:41.230
That man.

13:41.860 --> 13:43.320
Mr. Jeffries.

13:44.570 --> 13:45.970
I caught him taking
some jelly beans

13:46.170 --> 13:47.410
and he put them back.

13:48.070 --> 13:49.740
He put them back?

13:50.700 --> 13:51.740
He did.

13:53.790 --> 13:56.210
- I'll discuss this with him
next time he's in my store.

14:01.290 --> 14:02.380
You want one?

14:02.880 --> 14:04.010
No.

14:05.300 --> 14:07.300
Then what do you want?

14:08.090 --> 14:09.550
His hands were dirty.

[Ruth gasps in fear]

16:06.350 --> 16:07.780
Pardon me, Ma'am.

16:07.980 --> 16:09.670
I didn't mean to frighten you.

16:10.630 --> 16:12.780
We weren't sure
if anyone was home.

16:12.980 --> 16:15.790
Someone is home. Me.

16:15.990 --> 16:17.500
How can I help you?

16:17.700 --> 16:19.330
Yes, ma'am.

16:19.530 --> 16:23.210
First, let me apologize for
the rudeness of my introduction.

16:23.410 --> 16:24.550
My name is James McCallister,

16:24.750 --> 16:26.670
and me and my companions
have been on the road

16:26.870 --> 16:28.510
for several days now.

16:28.710 --> 16:31.780
We're plum tired and
we're more than a little lost.

16:33.110 --> 16:34.640
Companions?

16:34.840 --> 16:36.600
Yes, ma'am.

16:36.800 --> 16:39.330
That's Boots there
out by the road.

16:39.740 --> 16:42.060
He didn't want to ride up
to the house and frighten folks.

16:42.260 --> 16:43.440
Being polite.

16:43.640 --> 16:46.860
And behind you,
well, that's Big Mike.

16:47.060 --> 16:48.400
Thousand pardons, miss.

16:48.600 --> 16:50.570
I was just around back
checking to see

16:50.770 --> 16:52.630
if there's anybody
in your garden.

16:53.340 --> 16:54.280
Was there?

16:54.480 --> 16:55.590
Nope.

16:57.430 --> 16:59.620
- You gentlemen
should have just knocked.

16:59.820 --> 17:00.830
Well, we did knock, ma'am.

17:01.030 --> 17:02.960
Hm, that's true.

17:03.160 --> 17:06.170
I saw Big Mike step up
to that door and give it a rap.

17:06.370 --> 17:08.310
Most definitely witnessed that
with mine own.

17:10.150 --> 17:11.340
- Must not have
knocked too loud.

17:11.540 --> 17:13.970
I certainly didn't
hear it in the house.

17:14.170 --> 17:17.240
- [laughs]
Nevertheless.

17:18.490 --> 17:20.940
- Well, if you gentlemen
will just allow me a moment

17:21.140 --> 17:25.150
to put the laundry down,
I will happily point you

17:25.350 --> 17:27.690
in the direction of town.

17:27.890 --> 17:29.860
It's about a half hour's walk
up the road.

17:30.060 --> 17:31.700
And they've got
hotels and saloons,

17:31.900 --> 17:34.530
and a hot bath house
with a brand new shower.

17:34.730 --> 17:36.700
- Well, that would be
an act of kindness, ma'am.

17:36.900 --> 17:38.260
We'd be much obliged.

17:39.430 --> 17:41.120
- My husband
will be along any minute,

17:41.320 --> 17:44.390
so he might even be able to
show you the way himself.

17:45.980 --> 17:46.840
Your husband?

17:47.040 --> 17:48.590
Yes, sir. My husband.

17:48.790 --> 17:51.130
He should be along any moment.

17:51.330 --> 17:53.430
- Would your husband
happen to have been that feller

17:53.630 --> 17:56.010
we saw walking
down the road earlier?

17:56.210 --> 17:57.990
Walking with a little girl?

17:59.370 --> 18:01.770
- Yes, he was walking
our daughter to school.

18:01.970 --> 18:05.910
[laughing]

18:06.580 --> 18:07.860
Oh, ain't that somethin'.

18:08.060 --> 18:11.540
A grown man walking
a little girl to school.

18:12.340 --> 18:14.530
We certainly live in a new age.

18:14.730 --> 18:16.160
Sure does seem like it.

18:16.360 --> 18:17.740
[McCallister] It sure does.

18:17.940 --> 18:21.470
You said town's about a half
an hour walk up the road?

18:22.220 --> 18:23.420
That's right.

18:23.610 --> 18:25.210
Hm.

18:25.410 --> 18:28.420
Well, your man
sure been gone a long time

18:28.620 --> 18:31.020
if he was walking your daughter
to school and back.

18:34.650 --> 18:36.900
Sure hope nothin' happened
to hold him up.

18:39.490 --> 18:40.490
[Big Mike groans]

18:41.200 --> 18:42.060
[screams]

18:42.260 --> 18:43.700
[Eustice groans]

18:45.080 --> 18:46.980
[Eustice screaming in pain]

18:47.180 --> 18:48.190
Go help him.

18:48.390 --> 18:50.110
- [Eustice grunting]
- You all right?

18:50.310 --> 18:51.940
- [out of breath] The bitch
kicked me in the balls.

18:52.140 --> 18:53.530
- Just got your ass whooped
by an unarmed woman

18:53.730 --> 18:54.570
doing her laundry.

18:54.770 --> 18:56.510
- Yeah.
- You sure you have balls?

18:56.970 --> 18:59.050
[suspenseful music playing]

19:14.400 --> 19:15.980
- [knocks on door]
- Open up, missy.

19:16.990 --> 19:19.110
I'm coming in,
one way or another.

19:19.990 --> 19:22.370
Might as well not piss us off
in the meantime.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.490
- Madame, I think
you got the wrong idea

19:38.690 --> 19:39.880
about me and the fellas.

19:41.470 --> 19:43.640
Ain't no sense
runnin' off and hidin'.

19:44.510 --> 19:46.580
We don't want to hurt nobody.

19:46.780 --> 19:47.960
[Eustice] We need to quit
peckerin' around

19:48.160 --> 19:49.960
and get back on the trail.

19:50.160 --> 19:52.460
That marshal can't be
too far behind.

19:52.660 --> 19:55.230
A day, day and a half at most.

19:55.940 --> 19:56.880
We need to keep moving

19:57.080 --> 19:58.800
unless you fools want to
end up back in jail.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.470
- Eustice,
shut your damn mouth.

20:01.670 --> 20:04.560
- Now I know you're scared
and you're hiding.

20:04.760 --> 20:06.560
But if you just
poke your head out,

20:06.760 --> 20:09.310
you'll see
we don't got any guns.

20:09.510 --> 20:10.620
We just want to talk.

20:19.170 --> 20:20.870
[horse neighing]

20:21.070 --> 20:22.510
[horse galloping]

20:28.260 --> 20:29.330
[gun fired]

20:29.530 --> 20:31.430
[horse neighs in pain]

20:35.100 --> 20:36.230
Oh, shit.

20:38.190 --> 20:39.650
Go on. Go get her.

20:40.570 --> 20:42.100
Bring her back.

20:42.290 --> 20:43.490
[horse groans]

20:45.660 --> 20:48.490
[screaming]

20:55.120 --> 20:57.540
[breathing heavily]

21:04.720 --> 21:06.390
- You gon' live?
- Yeah.

21:10.930 --> 21:13.270
[♪♪♪]

21:22.190 --> 21:23.260
Bring her over!

21:23.460 --> 21:24.740
Quickly now!

21:27.620 --> 21:29.830
[Ruth groans]

21:33.790 --> 21:35.400
Her arm's all busted up.

21:35.600 --> 21:37.540
That's fine. That's fine.

21:38.080 --> 21:40.030
- [Ruth groans]
- I feel like we got off

21:40.230 --> 21:41.450
- to a bad start.
- [Ruth groans]

21:41.650 --> 21:43.620
- And I'm going to
put that on you.

21:43.810 --> 21:47.580
Now, when we first met,
I introduced myself, did I not?

21:47.780 --> 21:51.260
I said my name,
loud and clear.

21:52.140 --> 21:55.600
You did not do me
the same honor. Did ya?

21:58.190 --> 22:01.110
I said, did ya?

22:01.980 --> 22:04.110
- You'll get
no honor from me.

22:04.610 --> 22:05.950
Tell me this then, huh?

22:07.820 --> 22:09.950
Is this your husband? Hm?

22:11.330 --> 22:14.370
Is he the man we saw walking
down the street this morning?

22:14.790 --> 22:17.580
Is your husband
the 'Colton Briggs?'

22:18.620 --> 22:19.940
- Heard of my husband,
have you?

22:20.140 --> 22:24.130
- [laughs] Oh, I've certainly
heard of your husband.

22:25.010 --> 22:26.970
We're like family,
me and him.

22:27.300 --> 22:28.470
Good.

22:29.050 --> 22:32.260
That saves me the trouble
of explaining it to you.

22:35.640 --> 22:39.940
You boys are in a world of hurt.

22:41.650 --> 22:43.170
- Who the shit
is Colton Briggs?

22:43.370 --> 22:45.650
- Are you serious?
Colton Briggs?

22:46.320 --> 22:47.550
This is Colton Briggs' place?

22:47.750 --> 22:49.320
Eustice, quiet.

22:49.990 --> 22:50.990
That's right.

22:53.370 --> 22:54.990
And I'm his wife.

22:57.330 --> 22:59.120
And you hit me

22:59.460 --> 23:01.750
in the face with your gun.

23:04.380 --> 23:05.840
Broke my arm.

23:06.710 --> 23:08.760
Shot his horse.

23:14.180 --> 23:17.980
You boys have
woke up the devil.

23:19.230 --> 23:20.380
[ominous laugh]

23:20.580 --> 23:21.710
[Eustice] Goddamn it, Jimmy.

23:21.910 --> 23:23.860
You bringing hell down on us!

23:24.320 --> 23:28.530
- I absolutely know
your husband, hm.

23:29.860 --> 23:31.320
We go way back.

23:32.320 --> 23:34.950
In fact, I owe him a debt.

23:45.920 --> 23:48.170
- That'll do.
It's time to head home.

23:52.090 --> 23:54.200
- Mama didn't come
to get me from school.

23:54.400 --> 23:56.920
- You weren't at school.
You were here.

23:57.110 --> 23:58.580
- Yes, but wouldn't she
come here to find me

23:58.780 --> 23:59.890
if I wasn't at school?

24:06.860 --> 24:08.070
[door opens]

24:10.490 --> 24:12.570
[soft music]

24:17.410 --> 24:19.270
- [distant horse neighs]
- [Mark] Hey, Marshal!

24:19.470 --> 24:20.910
You better come on out here.

24:27.590 --> 24:29.450
Who are those men?

24:29.650 --> 24:31.780
[Marshal Jarrett] What do we
got here? The family?

24:31.980 --> 24:33.370
- Maybe looks like
the father and daughter

24:33.570 --> 24:35.180
from that picture
on the mantle in there.

24:41.310 --> 24:42.630
[Marshal Jarrett]
Must've been away

24:42.830 --> 24:44.550
when those fellas came through.

24:44.750 --> 24:46.010
Thank god they're okay.

24:46.210 --> 24:47.570
A little bit of luck, finally.

24:49.780 --> 24:51.280
Lucky, indeed.

24:54.070 --> 24:55.310
Tell the others
to come outside.

24:55.510 --> 24:57.060
We shouldn't be making
ourselves comfortable

24:57.260 --> 24:58.450
in these folks' home.

25:02.660 --> 25:04.690
[door creaks open]

25:04.890 --> 25:07.040
- Hey, you guys,
family's here.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.450
They still alive?

25:09.650 --> 25:10.550
Yup.

25:12.420 --> 25:13.800
Oh, shit.

25:16.390 --> 25:18.430
- [horse neighs]
- This you folks' home?

25:23.890 --> 25:25.920
I want to apologize for my men.

25:26.120 --> 25:29.510
We, uh, we didn't realize
that no one was home and--

25:29.710 --> 25:31.030
My wife was home.

25:34.030 --> 25:38.160
- Yes, sir.
I... I apologize again.

25:39.200 --> 25:41.310
My name is U.S. Marshal
Franklin Jarrett.

25:41.510 --> 25:43.040
I know who you are.

25:43.870 --> 25:45.000
Where's Ruth?

25:48.380 --> 25:51.000
- I'm afraid
you have me at a loss, sir.

25:52.210 --> 25:53.210
Do I know you?

26:00.430 --> 26:01.720
Briggs?

26:05.020 --> 26:07.000
Holy shit, man.

26:07.200 --> 26:08.270
I...

26:10.860 --> 26:12.050
I apologize, little lady.

26:12.250 --> 26:14.900
That language
is not appropriate.

26:18.320 --> 26:19.530
You have a family?

26:25.200 --> 26:27.210
Well, that is a good thing.

26:28.250 --> 26:32.170
A man needs a family.
It grounds him.

26:33.090 --> 26:35.370
Evens him out.
That is--this is good.

26:35.560 --> 26:36.510
Marshal.

26:45.980 --> 26:50.020
- I'm sorry, Briggs,
but we need to talk.

26:51.900 --> 26:54.860
[inhales] Somewhere private,
preferably.

26:59.110 --> 27:01.160
[crickets chirping]

27:03.740 --> 27:05.910
Why don't you boys go
help him dig that hole?

27:07.460 --> 27:09.070
Says he don't want our help.

27:09.260 --> 27:11.650
Says we should've been
better at our jobs.

27:11.850 --> 27:13.610
[Marshal Jarrett]
He ain't wrong.

27:13.810 --> 27:15.300
Go get them horses ready.

27:15.500 --> 27:16.760
[shovel hitting dirt]

27:25.430 --> 27:26.390
Little lady.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.800
I had Smiley heat up
some of that condensed milk

27:30.990 --> 27:32.590
and put a little
brown sugar in it.

27:32.790 --> 27:35.110
It's good.
Make you feel better.

27:48.790 --> 27:50.580
I never knew your mama.

27:52.120 --> 27:54.130
But I know
she was a good woman.

27:56.460 --> 27:58.170
But I did know your daddy.

27:59.470 --> 28:01.260
Years and years ago.

28:02.970 --> 28:05.040
You meet a lot of people
in this business,

28:05.240 --> 28:06.290
and the faces,
a lot of times,

28:06.490 --> 28:08.210
just disappear
over the years.

28:08.410 --> 28:10.810
But not your daddy.

28:11.640 --> 28:14.400
[chuckles] No, sir.
Not him.

28:16.650 --> 28:21.240
Your daddy was about the meanest
son of a bitch I ever met.

28:21.820 --> 28:26.120
Pardon my language, but...
I never met anybody like him.

28:27.870 --> 28:30.660
Just the way
he would look at you, just...

28:32.120 --> 28:34.330
like he was looking
through you.

28:35.750 --> 28:37.340
Like you were nothing.

28:41.380 --> 28:42.830
And I don't say this lightly,

28:43.030 --> 28:46.760
but y-your daddy
was a violent man.

28:47.180 --> 28:49.080
I seen him shoot
three cowboys one time.

28:49.280 --> 28:50.460
Now, it was a fair fight,

28:50.660 --> 28:53.980
but I don't think
his blood raised an ounce.

28:54.730 --> 28:56.300
I can't say he was a criminal.

28:56.500 --> 29:00.090
I don't know that,
but I can say that he

29:00.290 --> 29:02.490
was not what I would call
a "good man."

29:04.490 --> 29:05.570
Not back then.

29:07.370 --> 29:09.120
Why are you telling me this?

29:11.620 --> 29:12.580
Hm.

29:17.790 --> 29:20.340
I guess I just want you
to understand

29:21.880 --> 29:24.050
how good a woman your mama was.

29:25.300 --> 29:28.290
She took the coldest killer
that I've ever met,

29:28.490 --> 29:30.760
and she turned him
into a family man.

29:31.430 --> 29:33.020
Minding the store.

29:35.230 --> 29:36.850
Raising a little lady.

29:37.310 --> 29:39.400
That was a good thing
your mama done.

29:41.110 --> 29:42.990
- My father
used to kill people?

29:43.900 --> 29:47.240
- Yeah,
but that was years ago.

29:49.240 --> 29:51.580
- I haven't even seen
my father hold a gun.

29:52.040 --> 29:54.210
- And that's because
he's a good man now.

29:55.370 --> 29:57.040
Because of what
your mama done.

30:00.170 --> 30:03.960
- You carry a gun.
Are you a good man?

30:05.760 --> 30:07.090
I try to be.

30:08.260 --> 30:09.760
My mama's dead now.

30:13.770 --> 30:15.730
Is my father
still a good man?

30:22.110 --> 30:24.740
[emotional music playing]

30:34.120 --> 30:36.360
- Would you like for me
to say a few words?

30:36.560 --> 30:38.120
You said plenty of words.

30:38.750 --> 30:40.380
None of them helped.

30:40.920 --> 30:42.500
[hammering cross into ground]

30:45.670 --> 30:47.200
- There's something
you should know.

30:47.400 --> 30:51.760
Um, them fellas
left a mess in your barn.

30:53.560 --> 30:55.720
Not something
your little girl should see.

30:56.600 --> 30:59.850
You'll wanna clean that up
before you let her go in there.

31:01.190 --> 31:02.380
I reckon we'll be
hitting the trail.

31:02.580 --> 31:05.340
I figured we're only
a few hours behind 'em.

31:05.540 --> 31:08.180
And I think I've got a pretty
good idea where they're going.

31:08.380 --> 31:11.120
- Tell me the names
of the men who did this.

31:11.950 --> 31:13.160
Tell me where they're going.

31:15.370 --> 31:18.580
- No, sir.
I don't think I can do that.

31:20.080 --> 31:21.280
I reckon it's been a few years

31:21.480 --> 31:24.030
since the world has seen
the old Colton Briggs,

31:24.230 --> 31:26.030
and I think the world
is probably pretty happy

31:26.230 --> 31:28.280
leaving that
just right where it is.

31:28.480 --> 31:29.370
Tell me the names of the men

31:29.570 --> 31:31.700
responsible for
the death of my wife.

31:31.900 --> 31:33.580
[Marshal Jarrett]
Briggs, listen to yourself.

31:33.780 --> 31:35.670
You see that little girl
over there?

31:35.860 --> 31:39.640
She just lost her mama.
She needs her father now.

31:40.850 --> 31:44.340
Whatever changes happened to you
that that woman gave you,

31:44.540 --> 31:46.510
don't let 'em die with her.

31:46.710 --> 31:50.150
That little girl needs the man
that she knows and loves.

31:50.780 --> 31:54.390
You know, ever since
we were granted statehood,

31:54.590 --> 31:58.330
this here land is now
part of a new country.

31:58.700 --> 32:02.280
We got laws.
We got due process.

32:02.470 --> 32:05.150
Folks just don't go around
killin' other folks.

32:05.350 --> 32:07.460
That ain't the world anymore.

32:08.130 --> 32:12.470
Keep right by your daughter.
Keep right by God.

32:13.640 --> 32:17.250
I will find those murderous
sons of bitches.

32:17.450 --> 32:18.670
I will catch 'em.

32:18.870 --> 32:21.880
We will take them to trial,
and they will hang.

32:22.080 --> 32:23.850
I promise that to you.

32:25.060 --> 32:26.690
Take care of your daughter.

32:27.230 --> 32:29.820
As long as
that little girl is alive,

32:31.240 --> 32:34.070
there's no room for
vengeance in your life.

32:43.870 --> 32:44.920
[horse snorts]

32:55.260 --> 32:56.290
What do we do now?

32:56.490 --> 32:57.600
[Briggs] Go to bed.

32:59.560 --> 33:01.180
[footsteps receding]

33:03.440 --> 33:04.940
[horses snorting]

33:14.490 --> 33:16.620

34:48.330 --> 34:50.380
[intense music playing]

35:06.520 --> 35:08.230
"As long as she's alive."

35:33.460 --> 35:36.000
- Mama wouldn't like you
pointing that gun at me.

35:41.590 --> 35:42.950
[un-cocks pistol]

35:43.150 --> 35:44.970

[footsteps receding]

35:54.230 --> 35:56.070
[groaning]

35:58.440 --> 35:59.600
Get dressed.

35:59.790 --> 36:02.610
Those are pants. No dresses.

36:03.120 --> 36:04.870
We leave in 15 minutes.

36:09.790 --> 36:11.830
- [lantern breaks]
- [fire crackling]

36:12.500 --> 36:13.690
That's Mama's horse.

36:13.890 --> 36:15.490
Yeah. They killed mine.

36:15.690 --> 36:17.300
We'll have to travel light.

36:18.300 --> 36:19.950
- She can't run
with both of us.

36:20.150 --> 36:21.490
If we're gonna catch up
with those men,

36:21.690 --> 36:22.990
we're gonna need another horse.

36:23.190 --> 36:25.050
- Yeah. We'll find one
along the way.

36:33.650 --> 36:35.360
- [lantern breaks]
- [fire crackling]

36:47.700 --> 36:50.040
[horse neighs, gallops]

36:54.540 --> 36:56.340
[birds chirping]

37:02.170 --> 37:04.260
[Brooke] This is a good time
for us to do this.

37:04.680 --> 37:06.330
My teacher at school is sick.

37:06.530 --> 37:07.960
If it's pox,
she could be sick for days.

37:08.150 --> 37:09.160
She could die.

37:09.360 --> 37:10.720
They'll get a new teacher.

37:13.190 --> 37:14.460
I forgot my school books.

37:14.660 --> 37:15.710
I think they burned up
in the fire.

37:15.910 --> 37:16.840
[Briggs] We'll get new books.

37:17.040 --> 37:18.010
[Brooke] What about my clothes?

37:18.210 --> 37:19.130
We'll get new clothes.

37:19.330 --> 37:20.430
- Why did we burn
the old ones?

37:20.630 --> 37:22.070
- [impatiently] Because
we're not going back.

37:24.360 --> 37:26.030
We're not going back.

37:27.660 --> 37:29.180
As soon as I finish
what I have to do,

37:29.380 --> 37:30.520
we'll find a new place

37:30.720 --> 37:33.960
and we'll replace
everything you lost.

37:35.870 --> 37:37.250
'Cept Mama.

37:40.670 --> 37:42.710
[♪♪♪]

37:46.970 --> 37:48.890
[birds chirping]

37:52.520 --> 37:53.770
Give me the belt.

37:56.440 --> 37:57.650
You gonna whoop me?

38:11.370 --> 38:12.620
Take that.

38:13.870 --> 38:16.650
Over there by that tree.
Off the path.

38:16.850 --> 38:18.980
You can sleep for 30 minutes,
not longer.

38:19.180 --> 38:21.610
Then we'll eat,
and we'll get back on trail.

38:21.810 --> 38:23.920
We'll do that every four hours
until we catch 'em.

38:25.090 --> 38:26.830
- Aren't those men
getting further away?

38:27.030 --> 38:28.950
- They're only men.
They need sleep, as well.

38:29.150 --> 38:29.910
They'll wait for us.

38:30.110 --> 38:31.830
- But if we keep going,
we can be there sooner.

38:32.030 --> 38:32.830
Before anything...

38:33.030 --> 38:35.270
- Won't do us any good
if we get there dead tired.

38:35.730 --> 38:38.460
Or if our horse dies
from exhaustion.

38:38.660 --> 38:41.060
It's not enough
that we find these men.

38:41.480 --> 38:43.280
We need to be ready
to kill 'em.

38:43.860 --> 38:45.780
Because they'll be
meaning to kill us.

38:46.990 --> 38:48.070
[grunts]

38:48.990 --> 38:50.820
[♪♪♪]

38:58.920 --> 39:01.080
[upbeat music playing]

39:12.850 --> 39:14.460
- Did it seem
strange to you?

39:14.660 --> 39:16.310
That little girl last night?

39:17.480 --> 39:18.690
How do you mean?

39:19.480 --> 39:21.880
Her mama had just been killed.

39:22.080 --> 39:24.680
She was sittin' there
right next to the body.

39:24.870 --> 39:26.610
Not a tear on her face.

39:28.400 --> 39:30.200
Hell, I never even
met the woman.

39:30.660 --> 39:33.280
I cried more about it
than her own daughter.

39:34.200 --> 39:36.650
- Well, she's probably
just shocked from the news.

39:36.850 --> 39:37.860
I mean, her mama
was just killed.

39:38.050 --> 39:40.020
She ain't never coming back.

39:40.220 --> 39:42.920
Gotta be hard for any youngster
to understand.

39:44.460 --> 39:45.710
I suppose so.

39:47.550 --> 39:48.450
[gun fired]

39:48.650 --> 39:50.470
[horse neighs]

39:51.720 --> 39:52.840
Holy shit!

39:53.180 --> 39:54.300
[gun fired]

39:55.760 --> 39:56.620
Come on. Come on.

39:56.820 --> 39:58.810
Come on.
[rapid gunfire]

40:04.440 --> 40:05.590
[man] Argh!

40:05.790 --> 40:06.900
[body thuds]

40:08.740 --> 40:09.900
Holy shit, son.

40:10.490 --> 40:11.700
How'd you do that?

40:15.080 --> 40:16.200
[gun fired]

40:19.620 --> 40:20.870
- [groans]
My leg is busted.

40:23.630 --> 40:25.240
- [gun fired]
- Ahh.

40:25.440 --> 40:28.130
[rapid gunfire]

40:28.510 --> 40:29.710
[gun cocks]

40:32.050 --> 40:34.330
That one's a shooter, shit.

40:34.530 --> 40:35.640
It's that marshal.

40:36.100 --> 40:37.350
You didn't shoot the marshal?

40:39.890 --> 40:41.020
[gun fired]

40:42.770 --> 40:43.980
[gun cocks, fired]

40:46.310 --> 40:47.760
Goddamn it!

40:47.960 --> 40:50.510
That asshole started the ambush
before we were in position!

40:50.710 --> 40:51.860
[horse neighs]

40:54.450 --> 40:55.660
[horses neigh]

40:58.620 --> 40:59.650
What do we do?

40:59.840 --> 41:01.020
Do you see Briggs?

41:01.220 --> 41:03.290
- Shit, boss, I don't know
what he looks like.

41:04.750 --> 41:06.400
- Oh, you'll know
when you see him.

41:06.600 --> 41:07.490
I promise you that.

41:07.690 --> 41:08.880
[gunfire]

41:20.640 --> 41:21.810
[Marshal Jarrett]
Get down, Smiley!

41:22.930 --> 41:23.940
Oh.

41:24.440 --> 41:25.360
Dumbass.

41:25.560 --> 41:27.300
- Let's see how far
them bastards get now.

41:27.500 --> 41:28.360
[gunfire]

41:30.940 --> 41:32.470
Boss is pulling out.

41:32.670 --> 41:34.890
Next reload,
let's get up that hill.

41:35.090 --> 41:37.030
[rapid gunfire]

41:39.490 --> 41:40.740
I'm out of here.

41:44.410 --> 41:45.920
[gun cocking]

41:46.460 --> 41:47.580
God help us.

41:55.650 --> 41:57.590
[panting]

42:02.680 --> 42:03.680
Is it time to leave?

42:04.350 --> 42:07.480
- I heard gunshots coming
from across the canyon.

42:07.980 --> 42:09.670
- When?
- Ten minutes ago.

42:09.870 --> 42:11.230
Why didn't you wake me?

42:12.690 --> 42:14.850
No reason to hurry.

42:15.040 --> 42:17.970
Gunshots might have a way
of speeding some folks up,

42:18.170 --> 42:21.330
but they have
a nasty habit of...

42:21.700 --> 42:23.450
slowing other folks down.

42:28.000 --> 42:29.740
We'll find out what happened
soon enough.

42:29.930 --> 42:30.920
Either way.

42:36.010 --> 42:37.050
[McCallister]
I can't believe it.

42:39.010 --> 42:40.750
You want to tell me
what the hell just happened?

42:40.950 --> 42:42.920
- Huh?
- What the hell, boss?

42:43.110 --> 42:44.080
Those guys up front,

42:44.280 --> 42:45.710
they were about to go
behind the hill.

42:45.910 --> 42:47.000
I wouldn't have seen 'em
if I waited.

42:47.200 --> 42:50.340
- You were supposed to shoot
the marshal first. Huh?

42:50.540 --> 42:52.930
Instead, genius here decides to
shoot the first guy he sees,

42:53.120 --> 42:55.550
chasing everybody,
including the marshal,

42:55.750 --> 42:57.680
into cover. You know...

42:57.880 --> 43:01.480
I go to enormous pains to invite
Colton Briggs to come find me.

43:01.670 --> 43:02.810
You go ahead and leave

43:03.010 --> 43:04.480
a perfectly healthy lawman
between us.

43:04.680 --> 43:06.500
It's like you're
trying to work against me.

43:08.670 --> 43:10.790
Is that what's happening here?
Huh?

43:11.540 --> 43:13.130
You're working against me?

43:17.050 --> 43:18.340
Nah, boss.

43:19.380 --> 43:21.080
I'm with you.

43:21.280 --> 43:23.390
I just messed up. That's all.

43:23.890 --> 43:26.120
I certainly hope so.

43:26.320 --> 43:27.790
Because if that lawman
stops Briggs

43:27.990 --> 43:32.230
before he can get to me...
there will be hell to pay.

43:32.650 --> 43:33.840
Mm.

43:34.040 --> 43:35.820
[Eustice]
It don't matter for nothing.

43:38.240 --> 43:40.260
- You got somethin' to say,
old man?

43:40.460 --> 43:43.060
- If Colton Briggs
decides he's coming,

43:43.260 --> 43:45.850
you might as well set
an extra plate at the table

43:46.050 --> 43:47.620
because Colton Briggs is coming.

44:01.630 --> 44:02.660
What's going on?

44:02.860 --> 44:04.010
There's a rider coming.

44:05.510 --> 44:07.220
- One of the men
who killed Mama?

44:09.430 --> 44:11.630
Maybe one of the men
from the posse.

44:11.830 --> 44:13.810
- Either way,
we need his horse.

44:14.610 --> 44:16.340
- Are you gonna kill him?
- I'm gonna take his horse.

44:16.540 --> 44:18.220
Chances are, he won't
like me doing that.

44:18.420 --> 44:20.640
- I don't think Mama'd like you
killin' no lawman.

44:20.840 --> 44:22.310
- I don't know
if he is a lawman.

44:22.510 --> 44:25.200
Chances are he won't stop
and give me time to ask.

44:27.330 --> 44:29.200
- Can't you think of
another way to stop him?

44:42.880 --> 44:44.080
- He'll be coming
from that direction.

44:44.280 --> 44:45.890
You stand there
and get him to stop.

44:46.970 --> 44:48.120
How?

44:48.320 --> 44:50.390
- Cry.
Make him feel sorry for you.

44:53.020 --> 44:54.600
I don't know how.

44:55.150 --> 44:56.230
[exhales]

44:59.030 --> 45:00.360
What did you just say?

45:02.820 --> 45:04.320
I don't know how to cry.

45:07.030 --> 45:09.190
Now, you listen to me.

45:09.390 --> 45:12.860
People in this world
expect you to act like they do.

45:13.060 --> 45:14.400
They expect you to laugh
at their jokes,

45:14.600 --> 45:17.110
and sigh at their babies,
and cry at their funerals.

45:17.310 --> 45:18.740
And if you can't learn
to do those things,

45:18.940 --> 45:20.780
they won't accept you.
They'll push you out.

45:20.980 --> 45:22.870
Now, do you wanna make it
in this world?

45:23.070 --> 45:24.680
Answer me!
Do you wanna fit in?

45:25.890 --> 45:27.080
Then you're going to
have to figure out

45:27.280 --> 45:28.510
how to act like them.

45:30.270 --> 45:32.770
You remember last summer
when the parson's daughter died?

45:33.230 --> 45:34.960
You remember
how his wife cried?

45:35.160 --> 45:36.880
"Wahhhhhhhh!
Wahhhhhhhhh!"

45:37.080 --> 45:38.130
Wah! Wah!

45:38.330 --> 45:39.380
- A little louder.
Wahhhh! Wahhhh!

45:39.580 --> 45:40.880
"My baby! My baby!"

45:41.080 --> 45:42.390
- Wahhhhhhhh!
Wahhhhhhhhh!

45:42.590 --> 45:43.860
My baby! My baby!

45:45.200 --> 45:46.570
- That'll have to do.
Keep it up.

45:50.910 --> 45:52.850
Wahhhhh! Wahhhhh!

45:53.050 --> 45:54.730
Wahhh!
Wahhh!

45:54.930 --> 45:56.900
Wahhh!
Wahhh!

45:57.100 --> 45:58.110
You okay, little girl?

45:58.310 --> 45:59.950
- Waaaahh!
My baby! My baby!

46:00.140 --> 46:01.570
- Wahhhhhh!
- Baby? What baby?

46:01.770 --> 46:04.280
- What? What are you getting at?
- Wahhh! Wahhh!

46:04.480 --> 46:06.220
- [gun cocks]
- You're gettin' off that horse.

46:08.050 --> 46:09.430
[horse snorts]

46:10.600 --> 46:14.630
- You should have gone.
Mark, he looked pretty bad.

46:14.830 --> 46:15.750
What?

46:15.950 --> 46:18.050
Leave you two here
without protection?

46:18.250 --> 46:19.840
I ain't helpless.

46:20.040 --> 46:21.130
[Mark] Don't shoot.
Don't shoot.

46:21.330 --> 46:22.430
It's me.

46:22.630 --> 46:24.140
Shit, Mark.

46:24.340 --> 46:26.150
You scared the hell out of us.

46:26.910 --> 46:28.430
- The hell
are you doing back here?

46:28.630 --> 46:29.990
Where's your horse?

46:30.580 --> 46:32.440
Ask them.

46:32.640 --> 46:33.580
What the hell!

46:36.330 --> 46:37.290
I'm sorry, guys.

46:39.380 --> 46:42.150
- Now, Briggs,
I know you're upset.

46:42.350 --> 46:43.320
Hell, I don't blame you.

46:43.520 --> 46:45.030
But whatever you think
you're doing,

46:45.230 --> 46:47.010
you need to let these boys go.

46:48.510 --> 46:50.550
- Fetch that Rossi
and bring it here.

46:54.270 --> 46:56.140
My father wants your shotgun.

46:57.390 --> 46:59.060
Do what she says, Greg.

47:01.270 --> 47:03.130
- I will blow
this little girl's brains

47:03.330 --> 47:04.900
all over this valley.

47:09.030 --> 47:10.320
Do you hear me?

47:12.700 --> 47:15.580
I said I will blow her brains
all over this valley.

47:16.790 --> 47:18.400
I'll pull the trigger right now.

47:18.600 --> 47:19.670
Aahhh!

47:20.120 --> 47:22.340
[grunting]

47:30.930 --> 47:32.470
He cries pretty good.

47:35.270 --> 47:37.480
I'm gonna try and do it
like him next time.

47:39.640 --> 47:41.810
- Both of you put your hands
behind your back.

47:44.190 --> 47:46.110
[knife scraping]

47:50.320 --> 47:51.430
Is this enough wood?

47:51.630 --> 47:54.620
- That wood's too green.
It needs to burn hotter.

47:55.200 --> 47:58.980
See the tip of that?
Should burn so hot it glows red.

47:59.180 --> 48:00.480
Fetch dry wood.

48:00.680 --> 48:02.880
It burns hotter.
It burns faster.

48:03.460 --> 48:05.380
[knife scraping continues]

48:13.340 --> 48:15.040
Listen to me, Briggs.

48:15.240 --> 48:16.350
Just listen to me.

48:17.430 --> 48:19.750
Up till now, you haven't
committed any crimes

48:19.950 --> 48:21.520
that you can't walk away from.

48:23.810 --> 48:25.880
I understand that you're
under a lot of pressure,

48:26.080 --> 48:27.970
pain of losing your wife.

48:28.170 --> 48:29.470
I can't imagine it.

48:29.670 --> 48:31.300
Any man might have done
the same thing.

48:31.500 --> 48:34.470
Made some of the same decisions
that you've made.

48:34.670 --> 48:35.980
But you are about to
cross a line

48:36.180 --> 48:37.950
that you can't get back from.

48:38.490 --> 48:43.150
Assaulting a US Marshal,
murdering a US Marshal,

48:43.350 --> 48:46.880
that is trouble that you
have not encountered before.

48:48.880 --> 48:50.340
Are you sure about that?

48:55.600 --> 48:57.350
- What about
your daughter, Briggs?

48:57.890 --> 48:59.680
You're making her an accessory.

49:00.520 --> 49:02.210
These men here
need medical attention

49:02.410 --> 49:04.000
and you are preventing them
from getting it.

49:04.200 --> 49:06.420
No. You are.

49:06.620 --> 49:08.300
By not telling me
what I want to know.

49:08.500 --> 49:10.090
I'm a federal marshal.

49:10.290 --> 49:12.180
You're asking me
to participate in murder.

49:12.380 --> 49:13.680
You're protecting a killer.

49:13.880 --> 49:15.280
From another killer.

49:17.910 --> 49:18.830
Correct.

49:25.460 --> 49:26.570
Is this dry enough?

49:26.770 --> 49:28.900
- Good.
Put it on the fire.

49:29.100 --> 49:30.630
We'll be ready to start soon.

49:33.630 --> 49:35.790
- If anything happens to my men,
I swear to God,

49:35.990 --> 49:38.890
I will hunt you down
and I will kill you myself.

49:44.810 --> 49:47.480
- Like you hunted down the man
who killed my wife?

49:48.060 --> 49:49.970
The man who killed your men?

49:50.170 --> 49:53.240
The man responsible for
everything happening right now?

49:55.780 --> 49:57.770
I'll take my chances.

49:57.970 --> 49:58.810
Rip his shirt.

49:59.010 --> 50:00.480
Don't you touch me!

50:00.680 --> 50:03.080
- Give him the stick
like I showed you.

50:05.160 --> 50:06.070
[Mark] Please... don't.

50:06.270 --> 50:07.920
- James McCallister!
- [Mark] Aahh!

50:10.630 --> 50:11.950
Name's James McCallister.

50:12.150 --> 50:14.530
He rides with three men,
Michael Orleans

50:14.730 --> 50:17.510
and Boots Miller
and Eustice Bedford.

50:18.140 --> 50:19.450
They're all hardened criminals.

50:19.650 --> 50:20.660
Word is, he promised them

50:20.860 --> 50:22.750
a share of a lockbox
he's got stashed somewhere

50:22.950 --> 50:25.380
if they'd bust him out of
the prison in Powell County.

50:25.580 --> 50:27.000
And they're headed to Colorado.

50:27.200 --> 50:29.460
Somebody told me he's got
a little Mexican girl down there

50:29.660 --> 50:31.760
in a town he likes
called Santa Rosa.

50:31.960 --> 50:34.640
The trail I was on meant
that he was headed that way.

50:34.840 --> 50:37.820
And that's all I know about it.
I swear it.

50:39.660 --> 50:40.980
Hold him.

50:41.180 --> 50:42.100
[Mark] No, no.

50:42.300 --> 50:43.690
- Oh, you son of a bitch!
- Aaah!

50:43.890 --> 50:45.560
- I will kill you,
you son of a bitch!

50:45.760 --> 50:47.170
[screaming in pain]

50:52.800 --> 50:54.010
Bring me the iron.

50:58.840 --> 51:00.580
Pinch the flesh
on either side of the wound

51:00.780 --> 51:02.330
and push it together.

51:02.530 --> 51:07.020
We have to burn it with the iron
or he'll bleed out soon.

51:10.810 --> 51:12.510
- Smells like
Mama's rabbit chops.

51:12.710 --> 51:14.820
Mm, that's the whiskey.

51:17.820 --> 51:18.970
Makes me hungry.

51:19.170 --> 51:20.570
- Mm-hm.

51:22.370 --> 51:23.490
[pan clanks]

51:25.290 --> 51:27.040
The bullet was poisoning him.

51:27.460 --> 51:29.040
He's got a chance now.

51:29.790 --> 51:32.130
But these men are not
walking out of this canyon.

51:35.300 --> 51:37.570
If I get to Santa Rosa

51:37.770 --> 51:39.580
and there's no
James McCallister,

51:39.780 --> 51:42.660
no Mexican girl,
no gang of four,

51:42.860 --> 51:45.000
I will come back here
and I will kill these two men

51:45.200 --> 51:46.850
before you can return with help.

51:47.770 --> 51:49.810
And then, I will wait for you.

51:50.560 --> 51:52.460
And no matter how many men
you bring back with you,

51:52.660 --> 51:54.020
I will kill you first.

51:55.270 --> 51:58.530
I will kill you
before you even see me.

52:00.200 --> 52:01.950
Do you understand?

52:04.780 --> 52:07.400
We're taking your guns
and your horse.

52:07.600 --> 52:09.110
- You gotta leave me
a horse, Briggs!

52:09.310 --> 52:11.070
You can't take my horse!

52:11.270 --> 52:12.530
Take your mother's horse.

52:12.730 --> 52:13.690
This one suits me fine.

52:13.890 --> 52:15.240
Damn it, don't question me.

52:15.440 --> 52:17.110
You've got more experience
with your mother's horse.

52:17.310 --> 52:18.620
She knows you.
Fewer surprises.

52:18.810 --> 52:20.280
Now get up.

52:20.480 --> 52:21.680
[horse snorts]

52:42.990 --> 52:45.480
I'll leave your horse
tied up in Santa Rosa.

52:45.670 --> 52:46.950
I'm no horse thief.

52:47.740 --> 52:49.950
- Justice is going to
find you, Briggs.

52:50.450 --> 52:51.400
Hyah!

52:51.600 --> 52:54.000
- You hear me?
God damn you.

52:54.710 --> 52:56.670
Justice will catch you.

53:04.470 --> 53:07.010
[sedate music]

53:14.310 --> 53:16.610
[tense music]

53:33.460 --> 53:35.650
- There. Just like
I told you boys.

53:35.850 --> 53:38.150
[Eustice] Let's crack her open
and see what we got.

53:38.350 --> 53:40.300
[box hinges squeak]

53:41.460 --> 53:42.820
Oh, lordy.

53:43.020 --> 53:45.470
[laughing] Whoo! Whoo!

53:49.680 --> 53:53.810
"El Banco Londres Y Mexico"?

53:54.600 --> 53:56.600
- What the hell?
- Now settle down.

53:57.690 --> 53:59.090
What the hell, boss?

53:59.290 --> 54:01.260
Where's the money, boss?

54:01.460 --> 54:05.990
- Now, if I was crossing you,
I would have killed you already.

54:06.570 --> 54:07.660
But I didn't.

54:10.490 --> 54:12.290
Nothing but a dirty rat.

54:14.710 --> 54:16.610
- You ain't too bright now,
is you?

54:16.810 --> 54:18.280
But that's okay.
That's why you got me.

54:18.480 --> 54:19.570
I got brains.

54:19.770 --> 54:22.110
And my brains know that
since we busted out of jail,

54:22.310 --> 54:23.660
we're gonna have to
lay low for a while.

54:23.860 --> 54:25.450
At least a year or so.

54:25.650 --> 54:27.450
Any of you boys got any idea

54:27.650 --> 54:30.390
what kind of money they spend
down in old Mexico? Hm?

54:31.100 --> 54:31.960
Right there,

54:32.160 --> 54:33.710
that's enough dinero
for each of us

54:33.910 --> 54:36.170
to live like kings
for as long as we need.

54:36.370 --> 54:39.090
Each of you
get an equal share, hm,

54:39.290 --> 54:41.090
as long as you stick with me.

54:41.290 --> 54:44.640
Or, we can split it up here
and part ways as friends.

54:44.840 --> 54:46.140
But I will tell you this.

54:46.340 --> 54:48.740
That money, well...

54:49.780 --> 54:51.680
ain't worth a nickel
this side of the border.

54:51.880 --> 54:54.060
Not unless you know
where to spend it.

54:54.260 --> 54:57.120
And boys, I do.

54:59.580 --> 55:00.990
What about this Briggs fella?

55:01.190 --> 55:02.650
- Yeah, we're gonna
have to figure that out

55:02.850 --> 55:04.110
and figure it out fast.

55:04.310 --> 55:05.740
It's all part of the plan.

55:05.940 --> 55:07.620
- Should we wait for him
and set a ambush

55:07.820 --> 55:08.830
like we did for the Marshal?

55:09.030 --> 55:11.410
- We don't know how far behind us
Briggs might be.

55:11.610 --> 55:13.920
We could be sittin'
in the bush for days.

55:14.110 --> 55:15.920
And two, Briggs
ain't the type of man

55:16.120 --> 55:18.520
to walk into an ambush
unprepared.

55:19.310 --> 55:20.760
Then how do we hunt him down?

55:20.950 --> 55:23.230
I thought I made myself clear.

55:24.030 --> 55:26.110
We ain't huntin' nobody.

55:27.820 --> 55:29.490
Briggs is huntin' us.

55:30.070 --> 55:31.160
[laughs]

55:50.470 --> 55:51.700
What do we need that for?

55:51.900 --> 55:53.260
It's good firewood.

55:56.310 --> 55:57.630
It was on someone's grave.

55:57.830 --> 55:59.020
So?

56:00.730 --> 56:02.400
It belongs to someone.

56:05.480 --> 56:07.640
Nothing belongs to the dead

56:07.840 --> 56:09.610
because the dead
don't need anything.

56:10.200 --> 56:12.890
Only the living
need to possess things.

56:13.090 --> 56:15.950
The living need food,
water, shelter,

56:16.660 --> 56:21.190
clothes, family,
money and land.

56:21.390 --> 56:25.040
But the dead, the dead've
already been tended to.

56:25.540 --> 56:29.410
Once they're put in the ground,
they have all they need.

56:29.610 --> 56:31.130
They're not selfish.

56:32.050 --> 56:33.840
I like the dead.

56:42.940 --> 56:45.020
[horses neighing,
hooves clip-clopping]

56:58.700 --> 57:01.580
[Eustice] I don't like this.
There's a Sheriff.

57:02.080 --> 57:05.030
- Well, the Sheriff's in Denver.
Two days away.

57:05.230 --> 57:06.820
We cut the telegraph lines
coming into town,

57:07.020 --> 57:08.530
which means it'll be
upwards of four days

57:08.730 --> 57:10.570
before any sheriff can get
the news that we're here

57:10.770 --> 57:12.580
and show up and do anything
about it.

57:12.770 --> 57:14.490
That office is where
they keep the bad folks

57:14.690 --> 57:16.750
until the lawman
can come pick 'em up.

57:16.950 --> 57:17.970
[horses neighing]

57:20.350 --> 57:24.880
- Still, feelin' mighty exposed
ridin' into town like this.

57:25.080 --> 57:26.900
- You gonna question
my every call?

57:29.020 --> 57:30.680
Now, I need you boys
to set a guard

57:30.880 --> 57:32.010
at the edge of town, all right.

57:32.210 --> 57:34.510
Anyone rides in,
you let me know.

57:34.710 --> 57:36.770
And rotate every couple hours.

57:36.970 --> 57:38.310
You all look like dog shit.

57:38.510 --> 57:39.980
I need you rested
for when Briggs gets here

57:40.180 --> 57:42.870
or you're of no use to me.
Understand?

57:44.250 --> 57:47.320
And ladies, I assume
you're well rested.

57:47.520 --> 57:49.990
I am in need of your services.

57:50.190 --> 57:52.130
- You heard him.
Who wants first watch?

57:55.510 --> 57:57.040
Well, I'll take first watch,

57:57.240 --> 57:59.970
but you better come
and relieve me in four hours.

58:02.930 --> 58:05.810
[Big Mike] You want to give me
a hand with this? [grunts]

58:12.530 --> 58:14.150
[crickets chirping]

58:17.070 --> 58:19.160
- That marshal said
you used to kill people.

58:19.660 --> 58:21.390
- That marshal
should guard his words

58:21.590 --> 58:23.410
when speaking to children.

58:26.670 --> 58:27.830
Ahh.

58:28.380 --> 58:29.570
Is it true?

58:29.770 --> 58:31.000
Yes.

58:37.590 --> 58:38.930
He said you gave it up.

58:40.760 --> 58:42.890
He said you gave it up
for Mama.

58:47.310 --> 58:48.520
Is that true?

58:57.490 --> 58:59.410
He said Mama changed you.

59:03.790 --> 59:08.290
- My entire life,
even as a boy, I knew.

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
I knew I was different.

59:14.840 --> 59:18.530
My mother always said
I didn't cry as a baby.

59:18.730 --> 59:20.220
I didn't laugh.

59:21.930 --> 59:23.870
When my mother died,
I was very young,

59:24.070 --> 59:26.880
but I didn't shed a tear
at her funeral.

59:27.080 --> 59:29.480
Lots of folks did,
but I didn't.

59:29.980 --> 59:31.960
Growing up, the other kids
would play games

59:32.160 --> 59:35.220
and joke with each other,
and they would cry

59:35.420 --> 59:38.260
if they got hurt
or if they were scared.

59:38.460 --> 59:43.160
And I'd watch them.
I got pretty good at pretending.

59:44.870 --> 59:46.410
Good enough, anyway.

59:47.870 --> 59:50.620
Pretending I was like
the other kids.

59:51.540 --> 59:55.670
Pretending I was... normal.

59:57.210 --> 1:00:01.590
But that's when I realized
I had never known fear.

1:00:03.010 --> 1:00:04.750
My whole life, I'd seen fear

1:00:04.950 --> 1:00:07.420
in the eyes of every man
I ever met.

1:00:07.620 --> 1:00:09.420
Come to expect it.

1:00:09.620 --> 1:00:13.560
Grown men, terrified
when they had no reason to be.

1:00:17.820 --> 1:00:19.850
I remember this one man
who was looking for me

1:00:20.050 --> 1:00:23.140
because I had shot
a couple of his friends.

1:00:23.340 --> 1:00:26.140
He caught up with me
in a bathhouse.

1:00:26.340 --> 1:00:29.150
My pistol's lying out of reach,
next to my clothes.

1:00:29.350 --> 1:00:31.940
And I remember
seeing this man

1:00:32.140 --> 1:00:34.610
holding a gun
on a cold naked man

1:00:34.810 --> 1:00:37.610
sitting in a tub, and yet,
he was the one shaking.

1:00:37.810 --> 1:00:40.470
[scoffs] Too scared to move.

1:00:42.840 --> 1:00:45.960
So, I stood up from my bath,

1:00:46.150 --> 1:00:49.960
and I quietly walked over
to the man

1:00:50.160 --> 1:00:52.100
and I took his pistol away.

1:00:55.770 --> 1:00:58.030
And then
I shot him dead with it.

1:01:00.280 --> 1:01:02.570
He didn't even beg for his life.

1:01:08.540 --> 1:01:12.230
And even though I could
recognize fear in men,

1:01:12.430 --> 1:01:15.940
even to a point where
I could use it against them,

1:01:16.140 --> 1:01:18.150
I can honestly say
I had no idea

1:01:18.350 --> 1:01:20.050
what it actually felt like.

1:01:22.260 --> 1:01:23.680
It was as if...

1:01:25.430 --> 1:01:29.770
I'd been born dead inside.

1:01:31.980 --> 1:01:36.440
But I didn't care.
'Cuz I was dead inside.

1:01:38.730 --> 1:01:40.030
[liquid sloshing]

1:01:41.110 --> 1:01:42.110
Ahh.

1:01:50.330 --> 1:01:52.160
How did Mama change that?

1:01:55.210 --> 1:01:58.360
- When I met your mother,
there was no introduction.

1:01:58.560 --> 1:02:00.840
There was no getting
to know each other.

1:02:02.300 --> 1:02:05.510
And in that first moment
I saw her, I...

1:02:08.470 --> 1:02:10.140
I felt something.

1:02:12.720 --> 1:02:15.230
Something I'd never felt before.

1:02:16.400 --> 1:02:17.400
Love?

1:02:19.730 --> 1:02:21.150
Fear.

1:02:22.650 --> 1:02:26.570
Fear she wouldn't talk to me.
Fear she wouldn't love me.

1:02:28.030 --> 1:02:30.940
Fear I couldn't
make her my wife.

1:02:31.130 --> 1:02:33.160
[sobbing]

1:02:34.120 --> 1:02:36.500
Fear of losing her.

1:02:42.880 --> 1:02:45.380
She was the only thing
I ever feared

1:02:46.050 --> 1:02:47.890
and the only thing
I ever loved.

1:02:48.550 --> 1:02:51.050
[somber music]

1:03:01.320 --> 1:03:02.550
- When they told me
Mama was dead,

1:03:02.750 --> 1:03:04.390
I didn't know how to feel.

1:03:04.580 --> 1:03:09.320
- She was your mother.
You feel sad. You feel loss.

1:03:10.660 --> 1:03:12.240
Is that how you felt?

1:03:12.990 --> 1:03:14.620
I felt pain.

1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:19.120
Like a part of me
was killed with her.

1:03:21.500 --> 1:03:23.170
Do you still feel like that?

1:03:28.590 --> 1:03:32.010
When Mama died,
I didn't feel anything.

1:03:37.180 --> 1:03:38.770
It was as if I died.

1:03:44.440 --> 1:03:45.780
[in low tone]
Like I was lost.

1:03:47.440 --> 1:03:50.660
I was lying in my bed,
in my room.

1:03:53.490 --> 1:03:55.160
In our house.

1:03:59.580 --> 1:04:01.780
But it felt like I would
never find my way back

1:04:01.980 --> 1:04:03.460
to those things again.

1:04:04.840 --> 1:04:06.300
You will.

1:04:18.520 --> 1:04:21.340
- Do you know the man
who killed Mama?

1:04:21.540 --> 1:04:23.310
The man the Marshal
told us about?

1:04:25.440 --> 1:04:26.900
James McCallister?

1:04:30.950 --> 1:04:34.070
Tomorrow,
after the sun comes up...

1:04:36.830 --> 1:04:38.330
can you teach me how to shoot?

1:04:44.590 --> 1:04:45.500
Good.

1:04:48.050 --> 1:04:49.760
I think I'd like that.

1:04:54.180 --> 1:04:56.430
[uplifting music]

1:05:05.690 --> 1:05:08.470
Ohh! Son of a bitch.

1:05:08.670 --> 1:05:11.320
Oh. Oh, dammit.

1:05:11.520 --> 1:05:12.510
[♪♪♪]

1:05:12.710 --> 1:05:15.310
- Now remember,
keep your left eye closed.

1:05:15.510 --> 1:05:18.370
Let the barrel drift
right above your target.

1:05:18.790 --> 1:05:20.310
When you're ready,

1:05:20.510 --> 1:05:23.230
gently breathe all the air
out of your lungs

1:05:23.430 --> 1:05:25.080
and let the barrel fall.

1:05:25.460 --> 1:05:29.660
Time it so your breath ends
just as you line up your shot.

1:05:29.850 --> 1:05:32.490
At the bottom of your breath,
squeeze the trigger,

1:05:32.690 --> 1:05:34.990
don't pull, squeeze
with your whole hand.

1:05:35.190 --> 1:05:36.430
[gun fired]

1:05:45.350 --> 1:05:46.840
Were you aiming for the hat?

1:05:47.040 --> 1:05:50.260
- Just below it.
I was aiming for his chest.

1:05:50.460 --> 1:05:52.740
- You pulled.
You didn't squeeze.

1:05:56.410 --> 1:05:57.660
Let's try it again.

1:06:03.080 --> 1:06:04.270
[sighs]

1:06:04.470 --> 1:06:05.960
What's wrong?

1:06:07.250 --> 1:06:08.750
Can I try the pistol?

1:06:10.460 --> 1:06:12.710
[Briggs] Hyah! Hit!

1:06:14.420 --> 1:06:16.200
Remember to squeeze.

1:06:16.400 --> 1:06:17.340
Don't pull.

1:06:17.890 --> 1:06:19.760
[upbeat music]

- [horse neighing]
- [door opens]

1:06:40.990 --> 1:06:42.310
Morning, Eustice.

1:06:42.510 --> 1:06:43.520
Those turkey bungholes

1:06:43.720 --> 1:06:46.110
never relieved me of duty
last night.

1:06:46.310 --> 1:06:47.870
Left me sittin' out there
all night!

1:06:48.130 --> 1:06:49.330
Is that so?

1:06:50.500 --> 1:06:52.340
Boys? Come on down.

1:06:53.460 --> 1:06:54.410
[Big Mike] What is it, boss?

1:06:54.610 --> 1:06:56.530
Eustice here has a grievance

1:06:56.730 --> 1:06:59.050
he would like to air
with the rest of the gang.

1:06:59.470 --> 1:07:00.370
Go ahead.

1:07:00.570 --> 1:07:01.660
[Eustice] You two!

1:07:01.860 --> 1:07:04.330
You were supposed to relieve me
in my post, after four hours.

1:07:04.530 --> 1:07:06.210
And that didn't happen.

1:07:06.410 --> 1:07:07.420
And that's bullshit!

1:07:07.620 --> 1:07:09.670
- Eustice, please accept
my sincerest apologies

1:07:09.870 --> 1:07:11.260
on behalf of
the rest of the gang.

1:07:11.460 --> 1:07:13.650
We sure are sorry,
ain't we, boys?

1:07:14.820 --> 1:07:16.650
- And why didn't you
just come get us?

1:07:17.700 --> 1:07:18.510
What?

1:07:18.710 --> 1:07:21.060
- If we were supposed
to relieve you,

1:07:21.260 --> 1:07:23.640
why didn't you just come get
one of us to take your place?

1:07:23.840 --> 1:07:26.650
- Eustice? Why didn't you just
come get one of the boys?

1:07:26.850 --> 1:07:30.030
- Well, I-I didn't want
to leave my post, you know?

1:07:30.230 --> 1:07:32.190
I... Briggs is a dangerous man.

1:07:32.390 --> 1:07:34.490
And if he would've seen
there was no guard,

1:07:34.690 --> 1:07:36.700
he might have snuck in here
and got us.

1:07:36.900 --> 1:07:39.630
- You didn't...
fall asleep, did you?

1:07:42.050 --> 1:07:43.180
No, boss.

1:07:43.810 --> 1:07:47.890
- Eustice... you wouldn't be
lying to me, would you?

1:07:48.640 --> 1:07:50.800
- No, boss.
I mean, I-I might've--

1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:53.050
I might've shut my eyes
for a second or two as I--

1:07:53.250 --> 1:07:54.090
you know, I was so tired.

1:07:54.290 --> 1:07:55.340
It was--it was a long ride

1:07:55.540 --> 1:07:56.990
- and I-I--
- [McCallister] Eustice, shh.

1:07:59.200 --> 1:08:00.860
[stammers]

1:08:02.780 --> 1:08:05.790
- Falling asleep on guard duty
is a terrible thing to do.

1:08:07.290 --> 1:08:09.400
What if Briggs had shown up
and you'd been asleep?

1:08:09.600 --> 1:08:10.480
[Big Mike] Yeah.

1:08:10.680 --> 1:08:13.570
Yeah, he might have snuck in
and got us, like you said.

1:08:13.770 --> 1:08:15.360
- No!
I would have seen him.

1:08:15.560 --> 1:08:17.610

- [bones crack]

1:08:17.810 --> 1:08:19.720
Shh! Shh!

1:08:20.300 --> 1:08:22.620
Now, I did you a favor.

1:08:22.820 --> 1:08:23.620
All right.

1:08:23.820 --> 1:08:26.420
Next time you're on watch,
you get a little sleepy,

1:08:26.610 --> 1:08:28.580
you just give that broken
finger a squeeze,

1:08:28.780 --> 1:08:30.940
and you'll perk right back up.

1:08:39.440 --> 1:08:42.110
There's only one way into town.

1:08:42.660 --> 1:08:43.640
If they're down there,

1:08:43.840 --> 1:08:45.780
they'll be watching
everyone who comes in.

1:08:50.080 --> 1:08:52.780
They left a message in the barn.

1:08:52.970 --> 1:08:56.000
It felt familiar.
Like it was meant for me.

1:08:58.260 --> 1:08:59.630
What'd it say?

1:09:03.640 --> 1:09:04.790
I don't like walking in,

1:09:04.990 --> 1:09:06.370
not knowing
who I'm looking for.

1:09:06.570 --> 1:09:09.120
If they know me,
it'll give them the edge.

1:09:09.320 --> 1:09:10.460
They'll see me coming.

1:09:10.660 --> 1:09:11.980
I won't see them.

1:09:14.100 --> 1:09:15.860
Do you think they'll know me?

Pardon my manners.

You must have caught me

I almost forgot
why I came in here.

My mama got it in her head
yesterday

1:10:21.600 --> 1:10:22.490
that she had to bake a cake

for the church pot luck
this weekend.

1:10:24.400 --> 1:10:26.540
Last year, she made a pie,
but the apples she used

1:10:26.730 --> 1:10:28.000
grew on Mr. Johnson's
apple tree,

1:10:28.190 --> 1:10:29.830
the one back by his outhouse.

1:10:30.030 --> 1:10:30.960
And wouldn't you know it,

1:10:31.160 --> 1:10:32.540
those apples tasted
plum like shit

1:10:32.740 --> 1:10:34.770
and made anyone who ate 'em
sick to their gut.

1:10:35.310 --> 1:10:37.380

But Mr. Johnson says
that's a bunch of hooey,

1:10:42.710 --> 1:10:44.430
and because of that,
he won't let Mama

1:10:44.630 --> 1:10:46.050
have any more apples
for her apple pie,

is fine by me and my Mama

[Boots] Still no sign of him.

1:11:45.270 --> 1:11:46.340
[McCallister] Hm.

1:11:47.420 --> 1:11:48.830
He'll be around
soon enough, I 'spect.

1:11:49.030 --> 1:11:50.660
- This one
hasn't touched her food.

1:11:50.860 --> 1:11:52.790
- I 'spect
she's too scared to eat.

1:11:52.990 --> 1:11:56.020
Right, little sister?
You too scared to eat?

1:11:56.810 --> 1:11:57.930
No.

1:12:00.350 --> 1:12:01.300
[McCallister] Of course not.

1:12:01.500 --> 1:12:02.630
'Spect daughter
of Colton Briggs

1:12:02.830 --> 1:12:04.270
ain't scared of nothin.'

1:12:10.610 --> 1:12:12.430
You boys hang that sign
outside like I asked?

1:12:12.630 --> 1:12:15.060
- Red paint.
Just like you asked.

1:12:15.260 --> 1:12:16.810
- Good.
Where's Big Mike?

1:12:17.010 --> 1:12:19.020
- He's got a good angle
at the road into town.

1:12:19.220 --> 1:12:20.980
Ah, well.

1:12:21.180 --> 1:12:22.860
One of you set up
at the other end of town.

1:12:23.060 --> 1:12:24.190
The other across the street.

1:12:24.390 --> 1:12:25.590
Yes, sir.

1:12:26.630 --> 1:12:27.960
And, boys.

1:12:28.720 --> 1:12:30.160
Stay out of sight, all right?

1:12:30.360 --> 1:12:31.870
It's important he gets
to the middle of town

1:12:32.070 --> 1:12:33.500
and sees our invitation

1:12:33.690 --> 1:12:35.500
before we throw him
his little surprise party.

1:12:35.700 --> 1:12:37.670
- Boss, if we get
a chance to put a bullet

1:12:37.870 --> 1:12:40.000
in Colton Briggs,
we ought to do it.

1:12:40.200 --> 1:12:43.050
It ain't smart playing games
with a fella like that.

1:12:43.250 --> 1:12:45.170
- Sounds like
he's the one who's scared.

1:12:45.370 --> 1:12:46.780
[laughs]

1:12:48.320 --> 1:12:50.320
Sure does, doesn't it?

1:12:52.610 --> 1:12:54.370
You hear what
little sister said?

1:12:55.330 --> 1:12:56.640
You scared?

1:12:56.840 --> 1:12:58.790
- I'll take
the other end of town.

1:13:00.620 --> 1:13:03.080
[door opens and closes]

1:13:04.460 --> 1:13:06.000
[distant horse neighing]

1:13:10.880 --> 1:13:12.870
Boss is expecting Briggs
anytime.

1:13:13.070 --> 1:13:15.290
Might wanna wake your ass up.

1:13:15.490 --> 1:13:17.100
I'm awake.

1:13:17.560 --> 1:13:19.790
[Eustice] Good.
Keep it that way.

1:13:19.990 --> 1:13:22.560
We're supposed to let him get
into town before we kill him.

1:13:22.890 --> 1:13:25.130
Wants him to see that we got
his daughter or something.

1:13:25.330 --> 1:13:26.550
- Makes sense.
- [gun cocks]

1:13:26.750 --> 1:13:28.800
- You do yourself
and all of us a favor.

1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:32.360
You see that son of a bitch,
you put a bullet in him.

1:13:35.200 --> 1:13:36.370
Hi-ya!

1:13:40.750 --> 1:13:42.250
Go back right there...

1:13:48.880 --> 1:13:50.110
- If you ain't
too scared to eat,

1:13:50.310 --> 1:13:51.700
why ain't you touched
your food yet?

1:13:51.900 --> 1:13:52.910
It's probably poison.

1:13:53.110 --> 1:13:57.040
- So you is scared.
Scared of poison.

1:13:57.240 --> 1:13:59.760
- You don't have to be scared
to not eat poison.

1:14:00.520 --> 1:14:01.850
Just not stupid.

1:14:05.560 --> 1:14:06.900
[McCallister] You see this?

1:14:11.780 --> 1:14:12.860
No poison.

1:14:13.570 --> 1:14:15.740
I couldn't poison
even if I wanted to.

1:14:17.160 --> 1:14:19.660
Reckon it's some kind of sin
to poison your kin.

1:14:22.410 --> 1:14:24.310
Stop saying that.

1:14:24.510 --> 1:14:26.150
Stop sayin' what?

1:14:26.350 --> 1:14:27.920
Stop calling me your sister.

1:14:28.790 --> 1:14:30.280
We ain't kin.

1:14:30.480 --> 1:14:31.820
[McCallister] You and I
are most certainly kin

1:14:32.020 --> 1:14:33.200
in almost all respects.

1:14:33.400 --> 1:14:37.290
The, uh, fruits
of your father's labors,

1:14:37.490 --> 1:14:39.470
[chuckles]
sure as shootin'.

1:14:40.890 --> 1:14:41.960
You're a liar.

1:14:42.160 --> 1:14:44.540
- I'm not saying that
your daddy knocked my mama up

1:14:44.740 --> 1:14:46.380
and they made a baby.

1:14:46.580 --> 1:14:47.960
No, no, no.

1:14:48.160 --> 1:14:50.420
There was another man who had
the honors of my physical birth.

1:14:50.620 --> 1:14:53.110
But he's not around no more.

1:14:54.190 --> 1:14:56.740
On account of the day
I like to call my...

1:14:57.450 --> 1:14:59.350
"spiritual birth."

1:14:59.550 --> 1:15:01.100
You see, it was on that day

1:15:01.300 --> 1:15:02.700
that your daddy...

1:15:03.240 --> 1:15:05.150
Well, he decided
I didn't need mine anymore.

1:15:05.350 --> 1:15:08.920
He took him away from me.
Right there in front of me.

1:15:10.630 --> 1:15:11.750
I watched him die.

1:15:12.840 --> 1:15:14.460
Watched the life
leave his eyes.

1:15:17.130 --> 1:15:18.910
It was right then
that I stared into the eyes

1:15:19.110 --> 1:15:20.970
of the man who killed him.

1:15:21.550 --> 1:15:23.220
And you know
what your daddy did?

1:15:25.810 --> 1:15:27.350
He stared right back at me.

1:15:30.810 --> 1:15:35.400
Then he... he got on his horse
and he rode away.

1:15:38.780 --> 1:15:40.970
But not all of him. No.

1:15:41.170 --> 1:15:44.640
See, he... he left a tiny
little piece of himself

1:15:44.840 --> 1:15:48.670
buried deep inside of me.
Like a seed.

1:16:03.180 --> 1:16:05.600
[tense music playing]

1:16:18.990 --> 1:16:21.510
Workin' on a little
insurance policy.

1:16:21.710 --> 1:16:24.180
We don't need those boys
gettin' any ideas

1:16:24.380 --> 1:16:26.020
about running off
with the money.

1:16:26.220 --> 1:16:27.160
[chuckles]

1:16:28.000 --> 1:16:29.770
It used to be
I couldn't find nothing

1:16:29.970 --> 1:16:31.670
around these parts
except tequila.

1:16:34.040 --> 1:16:35.990
Finding whiskey in Santa Rosa?

1:16:36.190 --> 1:16:37.130
It's progress.

1:16:39.260 --> 1:16:41.950
You see,
the problem with progress

1:16:42.150 --> 1:16:43.870
is that something's gotta go.

1:16:44.070 --> 1:16:47.140
In with the new,
out with the old.

1:16:49.600 --> 1:16:51.190
That's the way of the world.

1:16:52.770 --> 1:16:54.480
But this transition...

1:16:56.270 --> 1:16:59.550
oh, it's rarely a peaceful one.

1:16:59.750 --> 1:17:00.740
No, ma'am.

1:17:01.200 --> 1:17:03.430
Transition of power
is one of violence.

1:17:03.630 --> 1:17:05.070
Necessary violence.

1:17:07.080 --> 1:17:08.660
Which is why we're here today.

1:17:10.120 --> 1:17:14.750
You see, I got a monster
inside of me.

1:17:15.670 --> 1:17:17.170
The devil himself.

1:17:17.840 --> 1:17:19.320
That devil can't get out

1:17:19.520 --> 1:17:21.470
while there's another
devil out there in the world.

1:17:22.930 --> 1:17:26.850
Both these devils
can't exist at the same time.

1:17:28.720 --> 1:17:30.100
Oh, I get it.

1:17:32.060 --> 1:17:33.440
You're crazy.

1:17:36.110 --> 1:17:37.800
But don't worry,
my father will be here soon.

1:17:38.000 --> 1:17:39.230
He'll fix that.

1:17:42.320 --> 1:17:43.740
[McCallister]
Hmm, you know,

1:17:45.910 --> 1:17:48.160
I'm glad we had
this time together.

1:17:48.950 --> 1:17:50.750
Get to know each other
as siblings.

1:17:52.710 --> 1:17:55.750
'Cuz after tonight,
after your father gets here...

1:17:59.050 --> 1:18:00.550
well, I'm gonna be
your new daddy.

1:18:02.590 --> 1:18:04.050
And we'll see
what needs fixin'.

1:18:12.560 --> 1:18:14.020

Eustice!

1:18:59.020 --> 1:19:00.380
Agh, he's here.

1:19:00.580 --> 1:19:01.380
Eustice!

1:19:01.580 --> 1:19:02.930
He's here!

1:19:03.130 --> 1:19:04.110
Help!

He's here.

Don't, mister, please,
don't kill--

1:19:25.970 --> 1:19:27.220
[rapid gunfire]

1:19:31.390 --> 1:19:33.580
He's here!
He done killed Big Mike,

1:19:33.780 --> 1:19:35.520
and got one of them
Mexican cowboys!

does not disappoint.

1:19:59.870 --> 1:20:00.940
[horse neighs]

1:20:01.140 --> 1:20:03.950
- He went down that alley
behind these buildings.

1:20:04.140 --> 1:20:05.420
Go around and flush him out.

1:20:07.630 --> 1:20:09.300
Christ Almighty.

1:20:09.880 --> 1:20:11.580
- Eustice, did you hear
what I said?

1:20:11.780 --> 1:20:12.680
Go!

1:20:22.940 --> 1:20:24.440
I got you, pendejo.

1:20:43.170 --> 1:20:44.240
You see him?

1:20:44.440 --> 1:20:46.550
- He must've circled back.

1:20:57.270 --> 1:20:58.330
I got him!

1:20:58.530 --> 1:21:00.710
He got Boots,
but I shot him!

1:21:00.910 --> 1:21:02.050
Is he dead?

1:21:02.240 --> 1:21:03.310
[Eustice] No. I only winged him.

1:21:03.850 --> 1:21:06.300
But I got a bullet in him,
sure as shit.

1:21:06.500 --> 1:21:08.840
He's holed up in that building
over there by the alley.

1:21:09.040 --> 1:21:10.680
You sure about that?

1:21:10.880 --> 1:21:12.600
He seem like the type of fella
to just hole up

1:21:12.800 --> 1:21:14.410
and wait for us
to come get him?

1:21:16.830 --> 1:21:17.950
Guess we'll see.

1:21:28.460 --> 1:21:30.570
[McCallister] You two,
you see that mercantile.

1:21:30.770 --> 1:21:32.660
Now, the villain that killed
your buddy is inside.

1:21:32.860 --> 1:21:34.290
Why don't you go in there
and get him?

1:21:34.490 --> 1:21:36.350
I'll double your pay
if you bring him out alive.

1:21:38.310 --> 1:21:40.670
Be careful now.
He's a snake.

1:21:40.870 --> 1:21:43.340
[Eustice] He may be a snake
but he ain't a goddamn wizard.

1:21:43.540 --> 1:21:44.520
Eustice.

1:21:46.860 --> 1:21:48.270

1:21:49.920 --> 1:21:52.030
[McCallister] I need you
to just trust me.

1:21:52.450 --> 1:21:53.780
Can you do that?

1:21:54.110 --> 1:21:56.220
Shame to have to let you go
so close to the end.

[McCallister] Briggs!

1:22:13.010 --> 1:22:14.630
I'm calling you out.

1:22:15.720 --> 1:22:18.140
Ain't that what
you boys used to do?

1:22:18.720 --> 1:22:20.770
Call each other out.

1:22:21.270 --> 1:22:23.230
Settle your differences
in the street.

1:22:26.560 --> 1:22:28.360
Let's do this the old way!

Holster that pistol, mister.

1:22:55.650 --> 1:22:58.090

I'll kill this little girl.

1:23:04.100 --> 1:23:05.730
[heavy footsteps]

1:23:09.610 --> 1:23:10.940
Hello, handsome.

1:23:11.730 --> 1:23:13.070
Remember me?

1:23:17.110 --> 1:23:18.740
No.

1:23:19.370 --> 1:23:20.570
[Eustice] Get your hands up.

1:23:23.790 --> 1:23:25.020
Both of 'em.

1:23:25.220 --> 1:23:26.500
It's busted.

1:23:27.960 --> 1:23:30.080
[Eustice] You got him, boss.
What are we gonna do?

1:23:31.790 --> 1:23:33.420
You really don't remember me.

1:23:36.130 --> 1:23:38.970
I gotta say,
hurts my feelings.

1:23:41.140 --> 1:23:42.930
But I guess
it's not too surprising.

1:23:43.350 --> 1:23:46.210
I was just a little whooper
last time you saw me.

1:23:46.410 --> 1:23:50.310
The important thing is,
I remember you.

1:23:54.980 --> 1:23:57.450
Don't worry. I'm okay.

1:23:58.740 --> 1:24:01.570
- I definitely remember you,
Colton Briggs.

1:24:02.240 --> 1:24:05.140
Every time I close my eyes,

1:24:05.340 --> 1:24:09.540
I see your face,
staring me down.

1:24:11.830 --> 1:24:14.570
I smell the smoke
from your guns,

1:24:14.770 --> 1:24:17.510
hear the noises my daddy made
as he died.

1:24:18.840 --> 1:24:20.550
And that's why we're here.

1:24:21.550 --> 1:24:25.390
You, me... your little girl.

1:24:27.560 --> 1:24:28.880
She never would
tell me her name,

1:24:29.080 --> 1:24:31.650
but it don't matter none.

1:24:32.310 --> 1:24:34.470
We're just one big happy family.

1:24:34.670 --> 1:24:35.860
[laughs]

1:24:38.940 --> 1:24:42.810
You see, we're gonna
have a showdown, you and me.

1:24:43.010 --> 1:24:45.480
And you get the opportunity
to put a bullet in my head

1:24:45.680 --> 1:24:47.580
just like you did my daddy.

1:24:48.540 --> 1:24:50.080
And if you do that,

1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:54.400
Eustice here, he's gonna blow
your little girl's head off.

1:24:54.600 --> 1:24:55.610
[Eustice] Boss, just kill him.

1:24:55.810 --> 1:24:56.880
[McCallister] Shut up.

1:24:58.010 --> 1:24:59.260
Now...

1:24:59.760 --> 1:25:01.370
you kill me,

1:25:01.570 --> 1:25:03.140
and watch your little girl die.

1:25:04.550 --> 1:25:07.930
Or save your daughter,
and watch me take your place.

1:25:13.190 --> 1:25:14.520
Brooke.

1:25:16.400 --> 1:25:18.360
I have all I need.

1:25:19.070 --> 1:25:20.650
See that I'm tended to.

1:25:21.360 --> 1:25:22.820
No.

1:25:25.120 --> 1:25:27.770
And I love you.

1:25:27.970 --> 1:25:29.270
[rapid gunfire]

1:25:29.470 --> 1:25:31.210
- [groans]
- No!

1:25:36.040 --> 1:25:37.490
Holy shit.

1:25:37.690 --> 1:25:40.590
I did it. [laughs]

1:25:43.430 --> 1:25:45.120
I killed him!

1:25:45.320 --> 1:25:47.460
I'm so sorry, Daddy.

1:25:47.650 --> 1:25:48.830
I love you so much.

1:25:49.030 --> 1:25:51.140
- [McCallister] I did it!
- I'm so sorry.

1:25:52.310 --> 1:25:53.770
[breathing heavily]

1:25:54.440 --> 1:25:56.460
I killed Colton Briggs.

1:25:56.660 --> 1:25:57.980
I killed him.

1:26:00.230 --> 1:26:01.970
- You hear that, Daddy?
- [gun cocks]

1:26:02.170 --> 1:26:03.260
I killed him.

1:26:03.460 --> 1:26:04.360
[gun fired]

1:26:07.450 --> 1:26:09.620
It's...
[panting]

1:26:10.830 --> 1:26:12.120
[gun cocks]

1:26:13.830 --> 1:26:14.830
It's you.

1:26:18.040 --> 1:26:18.900
You're the monster.

1:26:19.100 --> 1:26:20.130
[gun fired]

1:26:21.130 --> 1:26:22.110
[body thuds]

1:26:22.310 --> 1:26:23.420
You're no kin.

1:26:32.140 --> 1:26:33.890
Brooke...

1:26:35.730 --> 1:26:36.810
your mother.

1:26:37.860 --> 1:26:40.650
She'll tell you what to do.

1:26:41.150 --> 1:26:43.240
[breathing heavily]

1:26:53.160 --> 1:26:55.120
[sobbing]

1:26:59.380 --> 1:27:02.420
[emotional music playing]

1:27:16.350 --> 1:27:17.770
[Marshal Jarrett]
You alive?

1:27:23.980 --> 1:27:26.320
- Found another body
in the back alley back there.

1:27:27.030 --> 1:27:28.930
That makes four of 'em.

1:27:29.130 --> 1:27:30.910
[Marshal Jarrett] More or less
what I expected.

1:27:31.700 --> 1:27:34.060
Round up the bodies
and let's get 'em back.

1:27:34.260 --> 1:27:35.330
[horse snorts]

1:27:37.120 --> 1:27:38.460
Will they bring him home?

1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:41.340
Yeah, I suppose they will.

1:27:42.540 --> 1:27:43.670
Thank you.

1:27:48.010 --> 1:27:48.970
Marshal?

1:27:51.550 --> 1:27:53.310
What are you going to tell them?

1:27:56.180 --> 1:27:59.480
I thought I might bring you in
for what you and your daddy did.

1:28:01.110 --> 1:28:03.510
Tell them how you captured us
and tortured us

1:28:03.710 --> 1:28:06.530
and left us to die
out in the desert.

1:28:08.530 --> 1:28:10.430
But I suppose
the judge would just say

1:28:10.630 --> 1:28:13.020
that you were following
your daddy's orders

1:28:13.220 --> 1:28:17.830
and blind with rage
over your mama's murder--

1:28:18.500 --> 1:28:21.130
even though you and I both know
that ain't quite true.

1:28:23.090 --> 1:28:24.860
And in that case,

1:28:25.060 --> 1:28:27.590
your daddy would be buried
as a criminal.

1:28:28.380 --> 1:28:30.450
And you would go home
to try to figure out

1:28:30.650 --> 1:28:32.590
what to do with
your daddy's store.

1:28:34.970 --> 1:28:37.140
- Found a strongbox
in the saloon, Marshal.

1:28:39.940 --> 1:28:42.900
- Good work, Corporal.
That'll be all.

1:28:47.690 --> 1:28:49.470
And then I considered
telling them

1:28:49.670 --> 1:28:52.140
that you and your daddy
came along,

1:28:52.340 --> 1:28:54.390
and you saved my deputy's life

1:28:54.590 --> 1:28:57.940
by performing field surgery
on his shoulder.

1:28:58.140 --> 1:29:01.110
Then you proceeded to track down
your mother's murderers

1:29:01.310 --> 1:29:05.740
and then he was killed in the
process of their apprehension

1:29:05.940 --> 1:29:09.490
in which case
you would still go home.

1:29:09.690 --> 1:29:10.990
So I figure
since the outcomes

1:29:11.190 --> 1:29:14.040
in both those scenarios
are the same,

1:29:14.240 --> 1:29:16.790
I prefer the story
that doesn't involve me

1:29:16.990 --> 1:29:19.270
getting captured
by a 12-year-old girl.

1:29:20.810 --> 1:29:22.840
And maybe in that version,

1:29:23.040 --> 1:29:25.230
we can forget all about
that strong box too.

1:29:27.360 --> 1:29:28.570
In that version...

1:29:30.570 --> 1:29:32.450
my daddy gets to be a hero?

1:29:34.700 --> 1:29:35.990
[sighs deeply]

1:29:40.290 --> 1:29:44.000
In exchange for
your discretion... Yes.

1:29:45.080 --> 1:29:47.570
- I believe
that sounds about right.

1:29:47.770 --> 1:29:49.130
Well then, it's decided.

1:29:50.340 --> 1:29:51.760
Marshal?

1:29:54.220 --> 1:29:55.800
Did you find your horse?

1:29:56.640 --> 1:29:58.310
Tied up at the edge of town.

1:30:01.770 --> 1:30:03.600
- [sobbing]
Just like he said.

1:30:05.520 --> 1:30:07.190
You get on home, little Briggs.

1:30:08.360 --> 1:30:10.110
Take care of your daddy's store.

1:30:12.650 --> 1:30:13.780
Ya!

1:30:24.370 --> 1:30:25.870
You hear that, Daddy?

1:30:27.710 --> 1:30:29.130
You're gonna be a hero.

1:30:34.010 --> 1:30:35.450
Mama would be so proud.

1:30:35.650 --> 1:30:37.970
[somber music]

1:30:53.110 --> 1:30:54.240
Maria, isn't it?

1:30:54.780 --> 1:30:56.070
Si, Senorita.

1:30:57.410 --> 1:30:59.100
- Why don't you fetch me
my brother's saddlebag

1:30:59.300 --> 1:31:00.780
from inside the saloon?

1:31:02.540 --> 1:31:04.160
I best be getting on home.

1:31:16.130 --> 1:31:18.340
[♪♪♪]

1:31:32.770 --> 1:31:35.440
[ending music theme]

1:34:38.340 --> 1:34:41.210
[♪♪♪]
