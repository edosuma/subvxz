00:12.507 --> 00:14.540
You want a taste?

00:21.883 --> 00:23.015
Come in.

00:26.855 --> 00:29.255
Roman, just in time.

00:37.098 --> 00:39.098
It is. It's the best.

01:02.870 --> 01:04.670
This doesn't belong to you.

01:36.103 --> 01:37.703
You can't have it.

01:58.544 --> 02:00.283
We thought Sandstorm's first op

02:00.284 --> 02:02.750
was the Kentucky State bombing in 2013.

02:02.751 --> 02:04.317
We thought Jane in Times Square marked

02:04.319 --> 02:06.019
their first real change in tactics.

02:06.021 --> 02:09.322
We thought wrong. Sandstorm's
been operational a lot longer.

02:09.324 --> 02:10.757
Their plan's more dimensional

02:10.758 --> 02:11.925
than the intel originally showed.

02:12.289 --> 02:14.454
But that's not what scares
me about this chart.

02:14.455 --> 02:16.721
What scares me is what isn't here.

02:16.722 --> 02:18.489
We still know nothing about Phase Two.

02:18.491 --> 02:20.024
Except they're calling
it a complete reset.

02:20.027 --> 02:21.993
Which couldn't be good, right?

02:21.995 --> 02:24.029
Look, I'm working on it.

02:24.031 --> 02:25.641
Shepherd still doesn't trust me.

02:25.641 --> 02:27.541
She trusted you enough
to send you on a mission

02:27.543 --> 02:30.204
to steal a computer chip
critical to their plans.

02:30.205 --> 02:32.438
To back up Roman. It was his mission.

02:32.440 --> 02:34.206
You were alone with the chip, Jane.

02:34.208 --> 02:37.528
You had the chance to upload
its complete specs to Patterson,

02:37.528 --> 02:38.694
and what did you receive?

02:38.696 --> 02:40.262
- Hmm?
- Uh...

02:40.263 --> 02:43.105
I didn't get enough data
to draw any hard conclusions.

02:43.105 --> 02:44.838
So, what the hell went on out there?

02:49.742 --> 02:52.142
I aborted the upload
to save Roman's life.

02:52.144 --> 02:54.578
I know how bad that sounds,
but if Roman died,

02:54.580 --> 02:56.313
my cover could've died with him.

02:56.315 --> 02:58.716
He is the closest thing I have
to an ally within Sandstorm,

02:58.718 --> 03:00.084
and he could be our ally, too.

03:00.086 --> 03:01.719
- If we turn him...
- Saving your brother

03:01.721 --> 03:03.142
is not one of your mission objectives.

03:03.142 --> 03:04.675
Yes, but if we knew what he knew,

03:04.677 --> 03:06.311
it would be game over for Sandstorm.

03:06.311 --> 03:07.925
If we knew what was on the chip,

03:07.925 --> 03:09.792
it would be game over for Sandstorm.

03:09.793 --> 03:11.659
If you had just done
what was asked of you...

03:11.661 --> 03:13.428
No, we don't know what the chip is.

03:13.430 --> 03:15.897
But I do know how valuable Roman is.

03:15.899 --> 03:19.033
Okay, okay. Good meeting.

03:19.035 --> 03:20.869
We'll pick it up later.

03:20.871 --> 03:23.271
Nas, a word in my office.

03:31.590 --> 03:33.090
She's impossible.

03:33.092 --> 03:34.619
You're just figuring that out now?

03:34.620 --> 03:36.220
Even if we do turn Roman,

03:36.220 --> 03:38.452
the last thing I need to deal
with is a sociopathic killer.

03:38.452 --> 03:40.185
He's her brother... and if you don't

03:40.187 --> 03:42.020
at least hear her out,
you risk losing her.

03:42.022 --> 03:43.521
You really think that she
would turn to Sandstorm

03:43.523 --> 03:45.657
if she doesn't get her way?

03:45.659 --> 03:47.859
No. I don't.

03:47.861 --> 03:49.494
But we both know

03:49.496 --> 03:52.063
things get a little complicated
out there, don't they?

03:52.065 --> 03:54.399
Especially when you're so far from home.

03:57.204 --> 03:58.837
Do we need to talk about Bulgaria?

03:58.839 --> 04:00.972
No, not at all.

04:02.826 --> 04:05.076
We need to talk about that.

04:05.342 --> 04:07.359
This was found in Borden's therapy room.

04:07.361 --> 04:10.863
And it is transmitting
directly to your office.

04:19.240 --> 04:23.342
Sandstorm send you that
supercut of animal sneezes?

04:23.344 --> 04:26.778
Oh, no, no, it's... it's just a guy.

04:26.780 --> 04:28.722
- Just a guy?
- Oliver.

04:28.840 --> 04:30.673
I, uh, I met him at the museum,

04:30.675 --> 04:33.276
he's a water pollution expert.

04:33.278 --> 04:35.711
He keeps asking me what I'm up to.

04:35.713 --> 04:38.014
Give me your phone.

04:38.016 --> 04:40.183
How many times have you two been out?

04:40.185 --> 04:42.318
I don't think he's
interested in me like that.

04:42.320 --> 04:44.921
He's asked you out, like, six times.

04:44.923 --> 04:47.456
When a guy says, "I know a secret spot

04:47.458 --> 04:50.259
with the best food in
town," he's asking you out.

04:50.261 --> 04:52.528
Oh, my God.

04:52.530 --> 04:54.564
I get to be the relationship
expert right now.

04:54.565 --> 04:56.265
I never get to be the
relationship expert.

04:56.268 --> 04:58.168
Okay, here's what you're gonna text.

04:58.170 --> 05:00.203
Uh, no, I...

05:00.205 --> 05:02.672
I don't know if I'm ready for...

05:02.674 --> 05:05.408
I've never been on a real date.

05:05.411 --> 05:07.044
That I can remember, anyway.

05:07.430 --> 05:09.163
I remember my first date.

05:09.165 --> 05:11.599
Took him forever to stop crying.

05:14.838 --> 05:16.571
Oh, no.

05:17.874 --> 05:19.507
Oh, no-no-no-no...

05:19.509 --> 05:21.242
What's wrong? What's going on?

05:21.244 --> 05:24.879
Here... no-no-no-no no-no-no-no-no-no.

05:24.881 --> 05:26.714
And there is a very good reason...

05:26.716 --> 05:29.384
What, a good reason?
To spy on me and my team?

05:29.386 --> 05:32.987
I'm sorry to interrupt, but you
gotta come into CY-AC right now.

05:32.989 --> 05:36.257
Nothing's working. We're
locked out of every system.

05:36.259 --> 05:39.093
We're being hacked.

05:39.095 --> 05:42.730
- Tic-Tac-Toe?
- Shall we play a game?

05:42.732 --> 05:44.165
We're not gonna do that, right?

05:44.167 --> 05:45.533
Can't we just pull a plug or something?

05:45.951 --> 05:47.884
What do you think, Patterson?

05:47.886 --> 05:49.719
This all seems...

05:49.721 --> 05:51.455
Okay, you guys are taking forever.

05:51.457 --> 05:53.356
Rich, what the hell are you doing?

05:53.358 --> 05:56.259
Seriously? Nobody remembers "WarGames"?

05:56.261 --> 05:58.428
Shall we play a game?

05:58.430 --> 06:00.764
Matthew Broderick? Nobody? Bueller?

06:00.766 --> 06:02.833
- Who is this guy?
- Rich.com.

06:02.835 --> 06:05.335
Dark web hacker we caught last year.

06:05.337 --> 06:08.738
Until I busted out and tricked
these guys into helping me

06:08.740 --> 06:10.574
steal half a billion
dollars' worth of art.

06:10.576 --> 06:13.210
And then I escaped like a boss.

06:13.212 --> 06:15.045
Tell me you can track him.

06:15.047 --> 06:16.813
With what?

06:18.417 --> 06:21.251
Rich, we're not playing
any more of your games.

06:21.253 --> 06:23.825
Oh, this is not a game,
this is very, very real.

06:24.177 --> 06:25.743
Now, I'm gonna give
you back full control

06:25.745 --> 06:27.678
of your computers for a price.

06:27.679 --> 06:29.661
On the top floor of your
building, there is a secret

06:29.661 --> 06:31.227
Air Force drone command center.

06:31.229 --> 06:32.696
I'd like you to use that

06:32.698 --> 06:33.863
to bomb the following coordinates.

06:33.865 --> 06:35.198
No, not a chance.

06:35.200 --> 06:37.000
Well, then, in that case,

06:37.002 --> 06:39.469
I'm gonna delete every
FBI server in existence.

06:39.471 --> 06:41.927
Including the backups. So, good-bye,

06:41.927 --> 06:43.594
a hundred years of FBI
history, not to mention

06:43.596 --> 06:46.330
any active investigations, good-bye!

06:46.332 --> 06:47.931
You have until I'm done binge-watching

06:47.933 --> 06:50.067
"Stranger Things." No spoilers, please.

06:50.069 --> 06:52.970
All of this to make us drop
a bomb? I don't buy it.

06:52.972 --> 06:56.366
No, but you know what you do
buy is Pennsylvanian beer.

06:56.366 --> 06:59.367
So I think we've established that
you have atrocious judgment.

06:59.369 --> 07:01.341
Now, hurry up, please. I'm
already on episode seven.

07:01.341 --> 07:02.573
I can't believe they killed Barb.

07:02.575 --> 07:05.009
She is a smoke-show.

07:05.011 --> 07:06.511
When I took over for Mayfair,

07:06.513 --> 07:08.613
we installed a secure
line into my apartment.

07:08.615 --> 07:11.616
Is it possible that he's using
that to bypass the firewall?

07:11.618 --> 07:14.018
I mean, it's theoretically possible.

07:14.020 --> 07:16.053
You think he's in your apartment?

07:16.055 --> 07:18.256
How else would he know what
kind of beer I have there?

07:20.460 --> 07:23.127
- Hey, what took you so long?
- Put it down.

07:23.129 --> 07:25.396
- Keep your hands where I can see them.
- Clear!

07:25.398 --> 07:27.999
I had to switch to the good stuff
'cause you're out of beer.

07:28.001 --> 07:31.002
Thanks for the robe, by the way.

07:31.439 --> 07:33.072
Okay, so... you want my hands like this

07:33.074 --> 07:35.908
or more of a behind-the-back
type of situation? Okay.

07:35.910 --> 07:37.977
He seems pretty relaxed
for someone getting arrested.

07:37.979 --> 07:40.145
Yeah, almost like... Like
he wanted to get caught.

07:41.482 --> 07:43.248
Oh, my Hot Pockets are ready.

07:43.250 --> 07:45.060
Also, you're out of Hot Pockets.

07:59.538 --> 08:02.780
- Synced and corrected by hawken45 -
- www.addic7ed.com -

08:05.435 --> 08:07.970
Hey, there you guys are,
right where I left you...

08:07.970 --> 08:11.338
- oh, you're new.
- Shut up and walk.

08:12.547 --> 08:14.847
What the hell is he doing here?

08:14.849 --> 08:16.649
Detective Ray Yamada,
you should've signed in

08:16.651 --> 08:18.251
if you're gonna mess up my crime scene.

08:18.253 --> 08:20.286
And what's he doing with Gail Brown?
That's the A.D.A.

08:20.287 --> 08:21.820
who dropped the charges against Jones.

08:21.822 --> 08:23.188
I'll get rid of him.

08:23.190 --> 08:24.256
No, no, I'll see what they want.

08:24.258 --> 08:25.736
They want you, Reade.

08:25.736 --> 08:27.369
Yamada's probably just
covering his bases.

08:27.370 --> 08:28.836
With a prosecutor sitting next to him?

08:31.641 --> 08:33.875
Did you get rid of that tape yet?

08:36.645 --> 08:37.845
Yeah.

08:39.667 --> 08:41.067
Yeah, I got rid of it.

08:41.068 --> 08:43.058
You do believe me, don't you?

08:43.059 --> 08:45.389
That I didn't do it?

08:45.389 --> 08:46.522
I can't shake the feeling that

08:46.524 --> 08:48.224
you are not being straight with me.

08:50.962 --> 08:52.261
I'll handle it.

08:59.004 --> 09:01.238
The hack, the drone, the arrest,
none of it makes sense.

09:01.241 --> 09:02.941
So, why don't you start and tell us

09:02.943 --> 09:04.576
about the coordinates
you wanted us to bomb?

09:04.578 --> 09:06.010
Who is the new girl?

09:06.012 --> 09:08.346
They point to a silo in Kansas.

09:08.348 --> 09:10.448
- What's in it?
- I don't know, corn?

09:10.450 --> 09:13.081
I have no idea, I used a
random number generator.

09:13.081 --> 09:15.749
I just needed a reason for
you guys to arrest me.

09:15.751 --> 09:17.517
- Why?
- Seriously, what is the deal

09:17.519 --> 09:19.519
with Ms. Moneypenny over here?

09:19.521 --> 09:22.329
- Are you the new Mayfair?
- What's with the cover story, Rich?

09:22.330 --> 09:23.896
I have a professional
reputation to maintain.

09:23.898 --> 09:25.998
I can't just be seen going
to the feds for help.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.134
Help with what?

09:28.136 --> 09:30.870
I'm being hunted...

09:30.872 --> 09:32.805
by the Akkadian.

09:33.941 --> 09:35.574
Seriously? Nothing?

09:35.910 --> 09:37.343
You don't know who the... oh, my God.

09:37.345 --> 09:40.279
- How do you still have a job?
- Fine...

09:40.281 --> 09:43.416
- what's the Akkadian?
- It's a myth.

09:44.042 --> 09:46.876
It's an assassin so lethal
it's able to reach targets

09:46.878 --> 09:50.013
in such untouchable locations
that the intel community

09:50.015 --> 09:51.481
doesn't believe it even exists.

09:51.483 --> 09:53.321
Yeah, and neither does
Snopes, apparently.

09:53.322 --> 09:56.022
People are linking this
guy to every unsolved,

09:56.024 --> 09:58.210
high-profile death in the past 10 years.

09:58.211 --> 10:00.711
Which is impossible.
He's a catch-all bogeyman.

10:01.081 --> 10:02.981
Might as well tell us he's being
hunted by the Easter Bunny.

10:02.981 --> 10:05.715
Yeah, well, the Easter Bunny
didn't kill Boston Arliss Crab.

10:05.717 --> 10:08.651
- You're bleeding.
- And you're beautiful.

10:08.653 --> 10:10.086
Crab's dead?

10:12.669 --> 10:15.737
We were hiding out in
England when he found us.

10:16.957 --> 10:20.125
But Boston managed to drop
a chandelier on his head,

10:20.127 --> 10:21.793
buying me enough time to escape,

10:21.795 --> 10:24.729
but not enough time to
avoid having a knife

10:24.731 --> 10:26.264
plunged into his chest.

10:27.834 --> 10:30.268
He died in my arms.

10:30.270 --> 10:31.336
On the beach.

10:32.639 --> 10:34.806
Last thing he said to me was...

10:34.808 --> 10:38.209
"Such a beautiful place
to die with you."

10:42.062 --> 10:45.098
We had our spats, but Boston
gave his life to save mine.

10:45.099 --> 10:48.064
I will not have his death be in vain.

10:48.066 --> 10:52.202
Okay, Patterson, can we
confirm Boston's death?

10:52.204 --> 10:53.603
You got it.

10:57.342 --> 11:00.243
Let's say this Akkadian is real.

11:00.245 --> 11:02.078
Who hired him? Why?

11:02.080 --> 11:05.215
"Why"? Have you met me?

11:05.217 --> 11:07.250
As for who, I mean, who cares?

11:07.252 --> 11:10.048
There is a super-assassin
trying to murder me.

11:10.048 --> 11:11.545
You're kind of burying the lead here.

11:11.545 --> 11:13.144
Look, if the Akkadian isn't afraid

11:13.145 --> 11:14.912
to go after targets in
untouchable locations,

11:14.914 --> 11:17.233
what makes you think he
won't come after you here?

11:17.249 --> 11:18.648
Oh, I'm counting on it.

11:18.650 --> 11:20.450
I mean, what safer place
in the world to be

11:20.452 --> 11:22.688
than with my good friends at the FBI?

11:22.876 --> 11:25.021
So, now, when the Akkadian does come,

11:25.023 --> 11:26.789
you'll be forced to kill him for me.

11:26.791 --> 11:29.325
That's a good plan, innit?

11:31.727 --> 11:33.727
All right, so I figure you
guys got a ton of questions.

11:33.729 --> 11:35.161
Where do you want to begin?

11:35.162 --> 11:37.927
Jones' camp? Or the Hudson U shootings?

11:37.927 --> 11:39.593
Actually, before he gets to that,

11:39.594 --> 11:42.061
there's something I need to tell you.

11:42.063 --> 11:44.397
I'm sorry.

11:44.399 --> 11:47.467
We found a stash of hidden
videotapes in Jones's basement.

11:47.469 --> 11:50.036
Some are just old practice footage...

11:50.038 --> 11:54.547
But others show Jones being
the monster you said he was.

11:55.238 --> 11:57.097
I wanted to apologize in person.

11:57.098 --> 11:58.555
I'm sorry I didn't do more with the case

11:58.556 --> 12:00.718
when it was in my hands, Agent Reade.

12:03.344 --> 12:04.777
You want our help?

12:04.779 --> 12:06.412
You start being straight with us.

12:06.414 --> 12:08.981
You are so cute when
you're heteronormative.

12:08.983 --> 12:10.583
You want me to be straight? Okay.

12:10.585 --> 12:12.245
There is a lot of emotional distance

12:12.246 --> 12:13.681
between you two right now.

12:13.681 --> 12:15.581
And look at this, she can't
even maintain eye contact.

12:15.583 --> 12:17.868
What's going on? Did you guys have sex?

12:17.899 --> 12:18.932
Shut up.

12:18.934 --> 12:20.033
Oh, was it bad?

12:22.437 --> 12:24.304
Oh... this is interesting.

12:25.874 --> 12:27.006
Excuse me.

12:28.877 --> 12:31.644
Seriously, the chemistry
on this team is all off.

12:31.646 --> 12:33.279
I blame the Iron Lady here.

12:33.282 --> 12:35.603
This is like when they brought
in the second Aunt Viv.

12:35.619 --> 12:37.820
You remember that? That was messed up.

12:37.822 --> 12:39.955
Hey, Josh, what do you got?

12:39.957 --> 12:41.623
How about a murder weapon?

12:41.624 --> 12:42.942
A couple of beat cops just found a knife

12:42.942 --> 12:45.043
in a drainage ditch
near Jones's residence.

12:47.029 --> 12:48.362
What kind of knife?

12:48.364 --> 12:50.045
Don't know, just came in.

12:50.045 --> 12:52.011
Killer must've dropped it
down a sewer on his way out.

12:52.013 --> 12:53.680
Has it produced any suspects?

12:53.682 --> 12:56.516
I think Yamada's following
up on it right now.

12:58.253 --> 12:59.452
Thanks.

13:01.323 --> 13:03.456
Everyone could tell. She looked
nothing like the first one.

13:03.458 --> 13:05.325
You seem awfully
comfortable sitting here

13:05.327 --> 13:07.160
in this interrogation room, Rich.

13:07.529 --> 13:08.695
Well, yeah, what's not to like?

13:08.948 --> 13:09.963
Beautiful people.

13:10.530 --> 13:11.297
Clean lines.

13:11.299 --> 13:13.307
- That's fine.
- Nice, neutral color palette.

13:13.307 --> 13:14.350
I love the aluminum.

13:14.350 --> 13:16.384
- Change of scenery...
- I'm sorry, come again?

13:16.385 --> 13:17.817
No-no-no, I need to go back!

13:17.819 --> 13:18.985
No, I need to go back to the basement!

13:18.987 --> 13:20.820
Why did we leave the basement?

13:20.822 --> 13:22.722
FBI holding is the first
place he's gonna look,

13:22.724 --> 13:24.958
and I'm gonna be a dead man.
I should've stayed in hiding.

13:24.960 --> 13:26.826
I'm gonna be dead,
I'm gonna be "dead.com."

13:26.828 --> 13:28.228
Don't let them leave me here!
Don't let them leave me here!

13:28.230 --> 13:29.663
Rich, stop, get off of him!

13:29.665 --> 13:30.864
Who do you like, guys?
Do you like girls?

13:30.866 --> 13:32.999
- Do you like the third thing?
- Stop it!

13:33.001 --> 13:35.402
You don't wanna go in there,
start telling me the truth.

13:35.404 --> 13:36.903
I am telling you the truth.

13:36.905 --> 13:38.505
Get in there.

13:38.507 --> 13:40.331
Okay, wait-wait, don't
leave me here, please.

13:40.331 --> 13:42.665
I take it back, please,
okay, I take it back.

13:45.007 --> 13:46.907
Kurt is clearly still in love
with you, you don't see this?

13:46.909 --> 13:48.508
- Good-bye, Rich.
- You don't see this?

13:48.510 --> 13:51.645
He's just confused, Jane! He's confused!

13:51.647 --> 13:56.249
These are Jones's confirmed victims

13:56.251 --> 13:57.751
based on the tapes we found.

14:00.889 --> 14:02.322
Anyone stand out to you?

14:04.059 --> 14:06.960
As what? These are
survivors, not suspects.

14:06.962 --> 14:08.995
Right now they're both.

14:08.997 --> 14:10.297
We just need your help to figure out

14:10.299 --> 14:11.765
which of them we should be looking at.

14:14.666 --> 14:17.500
Okay, I see how it is.

14:17.502 --> 14:19.669
So you come here and "apologize,"

14:19.671 --> 14:21.004
and then you want me to help you

14:21.005 --> 14:22.558
play "pin the crime on the victim."

14:22.559 --> 14:23.076
Agent Reade...

14:23.077 --> 14:24.626
You want me to dredge up
these guys' worst memories,

14:24.628 --> 14:27.003
make them relive the worst
moments of their lives?

14:27.004 --> 14:29.287
We just want to know who killed Jones.

14:29.288 --> 14:32.789
You wanna know who killed Jones?
That person is in this room.

14:32.791 --> 14:35.392
Jones is dead because you dropped
the charges against him,

14:35.394 --> 14:36.748
because you didn't lock him up.

14:36.748 --> 14:38.494
Now, that's cool, I got
no problem with that.

14:38.550 --> 14:40.005
Jones got what he deserved.

14:40.006 --> 14:42.305
Excuse me, I have an urgent FBI matter

14:42.307 --> 14:44.518
I have to speak with Agent Reade about.

14:50.843 --> 14:52.145
What the hell are you doing?

14:52.146 --> 14:54.078
They want me to help pin Jones's
murder on one of the victims.

14:54.079 --> 14:55.745
They don't need your help.

14:55.747 --> 14:57.581
They found the murder weapon.

14:57.583 --> 14:59.883
You still think Yamada's just
trying to cover his bases?

14:59.885 --> 15:02.452
Hey... what's going on?

15:02.454 --> 15:04.087
Nothing.

15:04.089 --> 15:05.822
Let's go.

15:10.762 --> 15:14.530
Rich's blood turned up
traces of a malaria vaccine.

15:14.617 --> 15:16.951
That at least narrows
down his recent travels.

15:16.953 --> 15:18.486
Have we confirmed Boston's death yet?

15:18.488 --> 15:19.720
Wait-wait-wait.

15:19.722 --> 15:21.271
What is that?

15:21.272 --> 15:23.082
There's something in the wall.

15:25.276 --> 15:26.876
Whoa, hey-hey, don't shoot,
don't shoot, it's me.

15:26.878 --> 15:28.144
It's Rich. Hi.

15:28.146 --> 15:29.579
- Come here.
- Okay, just...

15:32.317 --> 15:34.524
How did you get out of the holding cell?

15:35.110 --> 15:36.090
Through the vent.

15:36.207 --> 15:37.410
I came to you for protection.

15:37.465 --> 15:38.730
Leaving me upstairs with
a couple of red shirts

15:38.732 --> 15:40.199
is not what I had in mind.

15:40.201 --> 15:41.867
Oh, hey, can you give
this to Sheriff Roscoe

15:41.869 --> 15:43.969
for me please, toots?

15:43.971 --> 15:47.395
I'll do whatever you need! Who do
you like, guys? Do you like girls?

15:47.403 --> 15:49.837
Call me "toots" again,
I'll make you eat this.

15:49.839 --> 15:51.086
Toots...

15:51.087 --> 15:53.056
Right, we need to get him off-site.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.930
And I think a trip to
Rikers without bail

15:54.930 --> 15:56.362
should be easy enough to arrange.

15:56.365 --> 15:58.332
Oh, I don't know, Rikers
doesn't have cable,

15:58.334 --> 16:00.301
and they're shockingly low
on quality board games.

16:00.303 --> 16:02.303
So, if you send me there,
I might get bored.

16:02.305 --> 16:04.105
And when I get bored,
I get kind of chatty.

16:04.107 --> 16:07.209
So I might start blabbing
about, oh, I don't know, Omaha?

16:08.177 --> 16:10.511
What's he talking about? What's Omaha?

16:10.513 --> 16:13.145
Oh, it's a glimmering city
on the Lewis and Clark trail.

16:13.146 --> 16:14.779
Home to the Henry Doorly Zoo.

16:14.781 --> 16:16.981
And apparently the codename
for a very secret...

16:16.983 --> 16:18.249
Let him stay.

16:18.251 --> 16:19.817
What's Omaha?

16:19.819 --> 16:22.654
I'm gonna call holding,
tell them we have Rich.

16:24.157 --> 16:25.623
You can also tell them they're fired.

16:30.096 --> 16:32.297
- What's wrong?
- No one's answering.

16:34.006 --> 16:35.806
Pull up the cameras in holding.

16:37.270 --> 16:38.369
What the hell?

16:38.371 --> 16:39.871
We were just there.

16:42.655 --> 16:45.481
What... oh, yeah, I killed
two guards with a tie clip

16:45.482 --> 16:46.881
and then crawled back
through an air duct

16:46.882 --> 16:48.482
to tell you all about it.

16:48.847 --> 16:50.280
I guess that would be
pretty cool, actually.

16:50.282 --> 16:51.704
Uh, jump back a minute.

17:01.360 --> 17:03.593
Okay, I think some of you
owe me an apology.

17:03.595 --> 17:05.228
Put out a red alert.

17:05.230 --> 17:07.525
We have an active shooter
in the building.

17:14.436 --> 17:16.771
All right, we've got an active
shooter in the building.

17:16.772 --> 17:18.473
And his target is right there.

17:18.474 --> 17:21.821
I want two agents guarding
every access point at all times.

17:21.823 --> 17:24.256
If a person can fit through
it, then lock it down.

17:24.258 --> 17:26.525
Reade, Tasha, take a
search team up to holding.

17:26.527 --> 17:27.708
See if you can pick up this guy's trail.

17:27.708 --> 17:30.442
Now, people, I want you
guys moving room to room.

17:30.443 --> 17:32.076
Check everyone's ID.

17:32.078 --> 17:34.078
If they clear, start moving
them out of the building.

17:34.080 --> 17:35.679
All right? And be smart.

17:35.681 --> 17:37.748
'Cause this shooter
could be anyone... move!

17:37.750 --> 17:39.016
Okay, if one of you is the Akkadian,

17:39.018 --> 17:40.367
I'm gonna be very, very hurt.

17:40.368 --> 17:41.868
I think I know how the killer got in.

17:41.870 --> 17:43.670
A security guard named
Steve Beck was just found

17:43.672 --> 17:45.638
murdered in his home in the Bronx.

17:45.640 --> 17:48.145
He still managed to clock
in for work this morning.

17:48.146 --> 17:50.479
I flagged his keycard. If he
uses it again, we'll know where.

17:50.481 --> 17:52.582
- Where do we keep Rich?
- Right here.

17:52.584 --> 17:54.383
We can keep the most eyes on him.

17:54.385 --> 17:56.085
You two, you put him
in that conference room

17:56.087 --> 17:57.520
and secure him.

17:57.522 --> 17:59.488
Yes, yes, more eyes on me, all the eyes.

17:59.490 --> 18:01.157
It's for our safety, not yours.

18:01.159 --> 18:02.925
Just because we believe you
doesn't mean we trust you.

18:02.927 --> 18:05.061
I do make it a challenge.

18:05.063 --> 18:06.462
I need to secure my office.

18:06.464 --> 18:07.797
We can't afford for it to be breached.

18:07.799 --> 18:11.601
Take Jane, all right? For backup.

18:29.483 --> 18:32.117
He's not all bad, you know, Roman.

18:32.120 --> 18:34.387
I'm just saying, there's...

18:34.389 --> 18:36.523
there's good in him, I've seen it.

18:38.060 --> 18:39.970
Okay.

18:39.971 --> 18:42.172
We're turning him into
an asset... in your mind,

18:42.174 --> 18:44.131
how do you imagine that working?

18:44.663 --> 18:49.123
I'd bring him in, you give him
the same deal you gave to me.

18:49.123 --> 18:51.223
Work for us, earn your freedom.

18:51.225 --> 18:53.759
He'd tell us everything we need
to know to stop Sandstorm.

18:53.761 --> 18:55.394
You'd never have to put him in the field

18:55.396 --> 18:57.334
if that's what you're worried about.

18:59.765 --> 19:02.432
Look, that's not what I'm
worried about, Jane.

19:03.971 --> 19:05.838
I had my own Roman.

19:05.840 --> 19:08.440
A zero division member that
I too grew very close to.

19:09.142 --> 19:11.543
But I missed the signs
that he was Sandstorm.

19:12.236 --> 19:15.019
By the time I realized, three
of my people were dead.

19:16.763 --> 19:18.848
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

19:18.918 --> 19:21.152
Since you've been reunited with Roman,

19:21.154 --> 19:23.284
he's killed no fewer than seven people.

19:23.308 --> 19:25.475
Because he's under Shepherd's influence.

19:25.477 --> 19:27.077
We get him away from her,

19:27.830 --> 19:30.264
I know he'll do the right thing.

19:31.271 --> 19:34.072
Okay, I'll... I'll consider it.

19:34.637 --> 19:36.203
Thank you.

19:37.125 --> 19:38.825
Rich, give me something that I can use.

19:38.827 --> 19:40.226
Why is this guy after you?

19:40.228 --> 19:41.581
Who did you piss off?

19:41.644 --> 19:43.110
The Russians? The Saudis?

19:43.112 --> 19:44.946
Yes, and... yes.

19:44.948 --> 19:46.847
But I'm telling you, the
"who" doesn't matter.

19:46.849 --> 19:49.483
Look, you want our help,
then help us trust you.

19:49.485 --> 19:51.852
I believe people can change and
that there's good in everyone.

19:51.854 --> 19:54.155
Even you. You say we're a team,

19:54.569 --> 19:56.290
this is your chance to
make it more than talk,

19:56.291 --> 19:58.123
so tell us what's really going on.

20:00.628 --> 20:02.261
It started in North Korea.

20:02.263 --> 20:04.696
Well, what did you steal?

20:04.698 --> 20:06.365
Nothing.

20:06.367 --> 20:11.870
I just kinda sorta made
a pass at Ri Sol-ju.

20:13.040 --> 20:14.506
You hit on Kim Jong-un's wife?

20:14.881 --> 20:16.642
She was laughing at all my jokes.

20:16.644 --> 20:18.610
I thought they had an open relationship.

20:18.612 --> 20:20.682
Anyway, long story short,
they very much do not.

20:20.683 --> 20:22.382
I don't even wanna tell you what
I had to do to get out of there.

20:22.384 --> 20:23.696
Actually, I kinda do.

20:23.696 --> 20:25.995
There was this real brute
of a guard named Gun Wu,

20:26.105 --> 20:28.573
and let's just say Gun Wu had
a real curious vibe to him...

20:28.575 --> 20:29.774
All right, I stand corrected.

20:29.776 --> 20:32.109
That was of absolutely no use.

20:34.647 --> 20:37.381
You guys wanna hear the rest or...?

20:47.727 --> 20:49.615
You wanna take care of the knife,

20:49.834 --> 20:51.445
it's headed to a crime lab today.

20:51.446 --> 20:53.480
It won't be the first time
that evidence went missing.

20:53.483 --> 20:57.118
That's insane. I don't need you
to take care of the knife

20:58.071 --> 20:59.120
because I didn't do it.

21:00.187 --> 21:00.421
Look...

21:00.422 --> 21:03.187
Reade, Zapata, I just got
a ping from the stolen ID.

21:03.188 --> 21:05.587
The Akkadian just used
it on the fifth floor.

21:18.936 --> 21:20.469
All right, are we on the right floor?

21:20.471 --> 21:21.803
Yes, he should still be there.

21:24.310 --> 21:26.520
Hands... who are you?
What are you doing here?

21:26.521 --> 21:29.588
I'm Clayton. I'm the mail guy!

21:30.428 --> 21:32.719
- He has Steve Beck's ID.
- Well, either he's the Akkadian...

21:32.720 --> 21:33.541
The Akkadian swapped badges.

21:33.541 --> 21:35.073
The mail guy's badge just pinged.

21:35.074 --> 21:36.307
Where?

21:36.317 --> 21:38.585
He's coming down the CY-AC elevator.

21:54.537 --> 21:55.803
It's a bomb.

21:55.805 --> 21:58.239
All right, seal these elevator doors.

21:58.242 --> 21:59.424
Everyone out of here, now.

21:59.425 --> 22:02.058
Wait-wait-wait, what is that smell?

22:02.060 --> 22:04.594
Sulfur.

22:04.596 --> 22:07.717
It's not just a bomb, it's a
chemical dispersion device.

22:08.161 --> 22:10.127
Sealing the doors will
just force the toxic cloud

22:10.129 --> 22:12.563
into the elevator shaft, where most
of the building's vents terminate.

22:12.565 --> 22:14.131
Increasing its range.

22:14.133 --> 22:15.286
How do we contain it?

22:15.287 --> 22:17.186
We don't. We have to defuse it.

22:25.807 --> 22:27.841
Patterson's lab's got
its own HVAC system.

22:27.843 --> 22:29.510
Get in there, make sure
everyone is with you.

22:29.512 --> 22:31.061
Good luck.

22:31.062 --> 22:33.730
All right, this is all
yours, what do you need?

22:33.732 --> 22:37.100
Hand sanitizer, and lots of it.

22:37.102 --> 22:40.601
How does this guy get a chemical
weapon inside this building?

22:40.617 --> 22:44.051
He didn't, everything he
needed was already here.

22:44.053 --> 22:45.686
Sulfide toner from the photo lab,

22:45.688 --> 22:47.955
mineral asset from forensics,

22:47.957 --> 22:49.056
and a urinal cake.

22:49.058 --> 22:50.525
Hopefully from the supply closet.

22:50.527 --> 22:52.894
Once the cake dissolves,
the chemicals mix,

22:52.896 --> 22:56.531
and you get a lethal cloud
of hydrogen sulfide gas

22:56.533 --> 22:59.133
and a secondary explosive that
spreads it through the building.

22:59.135 --> 23:01.035
Remove the cake, they mix.

23:01.037 --> 23:04.372
Jostle the jug or the chamber, they mix.

23:04.374 --> 23:05.573
Be careful.

23:07.076 --> 23:09.177
- Easy.
- All right, one down.

23:09.179 --> 23:12.446
Please, please, please...

23:12.448 --> 23:14.549
There.

23:14.551 --> 23:15.816
Last one.

23:17.086 --> 23:18.219
Okay.

23:19.255 --> 23:20.821
Okay.

23:20.823 --> 23:23.791
The alcohol from the sanitizer
neutralized the solution.

23:24.501 --> 23:26.067
I don't say this enough.

23:26.069 --> 23:27.469
You're very good at your job.

23:27.471 --> 23:30.238
We've still gotta disarm
the secondary explosive.

23:35.913 --> 23:39.547
Wait, that should've...

23:39.549 --> 23:41.182
that didn't... run, run!

23:55.565 --> 23:59.134
Patterson. Patterson?

23:59.136 --> 24:02.971
Agent down. Repeat, agent down!

24:05.509 --> 24:08.944
Patterson's injured, and three
people are dead because of you.

24:08.946 --> 24:10.196
We need to get him out of the building.

24:10.197 --> 24:13.260
No, we don't, that's exactly
what the Akkadian wants.

24:13.260 --> 24:15.260
- So, what do we do?
- We fortify ourselves.

24:15.745 --> 24:18.680
Restrict the Akkadian's
movements, make him come to us.

24:18.682 --> 24:21.015
Nas, you and I'll clear the floor.

24:21.017 --> 24:23.985
Jane, you stay with Rich. You watch him.

24:23.987 --> 24:25.687
Be ready for anything.

24:32.362 --> 24:34.278
You're just gonna avoid
the elephant in the room?

24:34.278 --> 24:35.972
You hid an elephant in there as well?

24:35.973 --> 24:37.539
Look, I'm sorry, all right?

24:37.541 --> 24:39.775
About the bug? Or the
fact that we found it?

24:39.777 --> 24:42.077
I need to know what is
in Jane's head at all times.

24:42.079 --> 24:44.846
The fact that she's so invested
in Roman is extremely worrying.

24:44.848 --> 24:47.249
He's her brother, and she's
trying to bring him to our side.

24:47.251 --> 24:49.305
Yeah, and that bond goes both ways.

24:49.461 --> 24:51.298
I need to know who is turning who.

24:51.299 --> 24:52.666
How do I know that you
don't have an archive

24:52.667 --> 24:55.276
of every conversation that
I've ever had in here?

24:55.917 --> 24:57.717
You wanna know what Omaha is?

24:57.720 --> 24:59.021
What has that got to do with this?

24:59.022 --> 25:00.620
The Winter leak was the biggest setback

25:00.624 --> 25:02.540
for American intelligence in 50 years.

25:02.541 --> 25:03.891
And we never saw it coming.

25:03.892 --> 25:06.793
We had to scrap our entire
domestic surveillance program.

25:06.795 --> 25:08.028
Omaha's the replacement?

25:08.030 --> 25:10.463
No, it's a vast improvement.

25:10.465 --> 25:14.267
There's no gaps, no
respectful boundaries.

25:14.739 --> 25:17.373
The Senate, the judiciary, the
Pentagon day care center,

25:17.375 --> 25:20.009
everything is being surveilled
so that, this time,

25:20.011 --> 25:21.878
we don't miss anything.

25:21.880 --> 25:23.846
Your point is that you
don't trust anyone?

25:23.848 --> 25:25.748
My point is, is that I'm
trying to trust you

25:25.750 --> 25:28.117
which is why I'm telling
you all of this.

25:28.119 --> 25:30.720
Let's move.

25:34.716 --> 25:37.120
If Yamada didn't suspect you
before, he definitely does now

25:37.121 --> 25:38.953
after that little outburst of yours.

25:38.955 --> 25:40.621
So, let him.

25:40.623 --> 25:42.056
I don't care anymore.

25:44.160 --> 25:46.594
Well, I do, I'm on the hook now, too.

25:48.031 --> 25:49.511
We gotta take care of that knife.

25:49.511 --> 25:50.844
We don't have to do anything.

25:50.846 --> 25:52.447
I'm the one who was at Jones's camp.

25:52.447 --> 25:53.649
I'm the one missing time.

25:53.650 --> 25:54.815
I'm the one who was there that night.

25:54.817 --> 25:56.951
When did this become all about you?

25:57.216 --> 25:58.582
Nobody asked you to commit a felony.

25:58.584 --> 26:00.584
You took it upon yourself to do that.

26:00.586 --> 26:01.885
Because you're not placing bets anymore,

26:01.887 --> 26:04.721
but you're still addicted to risk.

26:04.723 --> 26:05.709
You don't care about me.

26:05.710 --> 26:07.242
My life is just something
for you to gamble on.

26:09.916 --> 26:11.087
Fine.

26:11.087 --> 26:13.087
I'm out.

26:15.158 --> 26:17.091
Zapata...

26:20.196 --> 26:21.262
Look.

26:30.306 --> 26:32.206
- Clear.
- Clear.

27:09.235 --> 27:11.268
Over here! Reade.

27:11.270 --> 27:14.271
Tasha? Tasha?

27:14.273 --> 27:15.239
Are you okay?

27:15.241 --> 27:16.440
Tasha?

27:16.442 --> 27:18.909
Easy.

27:18.911 --> 27:20.444
Tasha?

27:20.446 --> 27:21.779
Tasha?

27:21.781 --> 27:23.848
He's got Zapata.

27:29.162 --> 27:31.171
- We gotta get her back.
- We're searching the building right now.

27:31.171 --> 27:32.982
With most of it being evacuated,
they could be anywhere.

27:32.983 --> 27:34.597
We will find her, all right? I swear.

27:34.598 --> 27:36.565
Why would the Akkadian be
messing with the wiring?

27:36.569 --> 27:38.869
He's tapped into the
building's security cameras.

27:38.932 --> 27:40.405
So, he can see us.

27:40.406 --> 27:42.473
- He can't hear us.
- Then we need to move Rich.

27:42.475 --> 27:44.408
No, we've got to focus
on getting Zapata back.

27:44.410 --> 27:47.145
To the FBI agents protecting Rich.com,

27:47.147 --> 27:50.014
I'm in the C1 administrator's office.

27:51.137 --> 27:53.841
The Akkadian has injected
me with a neuro-toxin

27:53.842 --> 27:56.375
that will slowly kill...

27:56.377 --> 27:58.877
that will slowly kill me.

28:00.381 --> 28:02.381
He's leaving three vials.

28:02.383 --> 28:04.116
One is an antidote.

28:04.118 --> 28:06.685
The others will kill me instantly.

28:06.687 --> 28:10.923
Leave Rich alone, and he'll
tell you which one to use.

28:22.036 --> 28:23.535
Make the trade. Zapata's life

28:23.537 --> 28:24.970
is worth twice as much as Rich's.

28:24.972 --> 28:27.472
I can't say I entirely
disagree with you.

28:27.474 --> 28:29.141
But still, how can we trust this guy?

28:29.143 --> 28:31.843
- Are you serious?
- Unfortunately, Reade, he's right.

28:31.845 --> 28:33.712
If we do agree to the Akkadian's terms,

28:33.714 --> 28:35.080
he could've already killed Tasha.

28:35.082 --> 28:36.848
Yeah, but we still have to try, right?

28:36.850 --> 28:39.318
Let's start by cutting his
access to the cameras.

28:39.320 --> 28:41.486
No, let's do what the Akkadian says.

28:41.488 --> 28:42.854
Clear the floor and leave Rich alone.

28:42.855 --> 28:45.129
I'm sorry, what is the
point of that plan?

28:45.130 --> 28:47.269
Just for a few seconds.
Then we loop the footage

28:47.269 --> 28:49.403
of those few seconds
back into the security feed

28:49.404 --> 28:50.596
while we retake the floor.

28:50.597 --> 28:52.463
- And lie in wait.
- Do it.

28:52.465 --> 28:53.998
It'll take me about 10 minutes or so...

28:54.000 --> 28:55.967
No, that's too long. She
could be dead by then.

28:55.969 --> 28:58.169
Uh, I could write that
exploit in 30 seconds

28:58.171 --> 28:59.504
and create the loop of me
alone while I'm at it.

28:59.506 --> 29:00.838
It'd be seamless.

29:00.840 --> 29:02.607
There's no way I'm leaving him alone

29:02.609 --> 29:04.742
with an FBI computer.
He could steal data,

29:04.744 --> 29:06.144
plant a virus, or he could start a war.

29:06.146 --> 29:07.745
Would you accept a pinky swear?

29:07.747 --> 29:09.347
Look, I don't think we have a choice.

29:09.349 --> 29:12.650
She's right. Nas, Reade, go get Tasha.

29:12.652 --> 29:13.851
All right? We'll stay here

29:13.853 --> 29:15.419
and lay in wait for the Akkadian.

29:15.421 --> 29:17.922
And you...

29:17.924 --> 29:19.690
stand up.

29:24.097 --> 29:27.198
You do anything other
than look in that camera,

29:27.200 --> 29:29.333
I'll make sure you can never type again.

29:29.335 --> 29:30.601
You understand me?

29:30.603 --> 29:31.936
Please don't leave me in here, you guys.

29:31.938 --> 29:34.138
Please don't go. Please come back here

29:34.140 --> 29:35.640
and cuff me to this chair.

29:35.642 --> 29:38.242
Yeah. Okay...

29:48.521 --> 29:51.255
Zapata? Zapata?

30:03.469 --> 30:05.336
Tasha? Tasha?!

30:06.406 --> 30:08.492
Stay with me. Stay with me.

30:08.493 --> 30:09.726
Tasha?

30:13.646 --> 30:15.646
Hey, maybe he's not buying it.

30:15.648 --> 30:17.481
Maybe he's seen "Speed,"
you know, 'cause this is

30:17.483 --> 30:19.383
basically the same thing
they did in that movie.

30:19.385 --> 30:20.685
We...

30:21.319 --> 30:23.686
You know Joss Whedon
wrote most of "Speed"?

30:23.688 --> 30:25.039
I mean, like, the good parts.

30:25.040 --> 30:26.773
Joss Whedon basically wrote all
the good parts of that movie.

31:01.956 --> 31:03.956
Wait, no, we need him for the antidote!

31:07.295 --> 31:08.661
We're losing her.

31:17.038 --> 31:18.554
This doesn't belong to you.

31:27.315 --> 31:28.648
Which vial is it?

31:35.990 --> 31:38.924
Which one's the antidote? Tell me!

31:38.926 --> 31:40.459
No!

31:51.939 --> 31:52.972
Damn it.

31:52.974 --> 31:54.774
The Akkadian's dead.

31:54.776 --> 31:56.942
Tasha, stay with me.
Tasha! Stay with me.

31:56.944 --> 31:58.144
Stay with me.

31:58.146 --> 31:59.779
We have to pick a vial.

31:59.781 --> 32:01.514
A 33% chance of living is better

32:01.516 --> 32:03.883
than a 0% chance if we do nothing.

32:06.521 --> 32:08.020
Wait, wait!

32:10.158 --> 32:11.791
Her finger isn't twitching.

32:11.793 --> 32:13.326
She's tapping something.

32:14.829 --> 32:16.162
She's tapping a message.

32:16.164 --> 32:18.164
Is it Morse code?

32:19.467 --> 32:21.033
Left, she's saying left.

32:22.637 --> 32:24.036
Hold on, Tasha.

32:33.281 --> 32:34.647
It's working.

32:34.649 --> 32:36.115
Her breathing's stabilizing.

32:38.319 --> 32:41.554
She's coming back. She's gonna be fine.

32:48.529 --> 32:50.596
Is this entirely necessary?

32:50.598 --> 32:52.298
Yes.

32:52.300 --> 32:54.633
Sending me back to prison
is so unimaginative.

32:54.635 --> 32:56.469
We could make this,
like, a regular thing.

32:56.471 --> 32:57.803
Meaning?

32:57.805 --> 32:59.438
The criminals that you
hunt for a living,

32:59.440 --> 33:01.607
I brunch with them. Think about it.

33:01.609 --> 33:03.142
I could be the ace up your sleeve.

33:03.144 --> 33:07.446
My brains, his brawn,
your... everything else.

33:07.448 --> 33:09.815
The three of us could take
down anybody we wanted.

33:09.817 --> 33:11.250
We could make it, like, a weekly thing.

33:11.289 --> 33:12.622
I could wear a hat of some kind.

33:12.624 --> 33:13.331
Department of Corrections.

33:13.332 --> 33:15.399
I think people would be
into that. What do you say?

33:15.400 --> 33:16.800
This is Kurt Weller.

33:16.801 --> 33:18.709
I have a prisoner ready for transport.

33:18.709 --> 33:20.442
Oh, you guys are no fun.

33:20.445 --> 33:21.777
What's your ETA?

33:21.779 --> 33:23.713
We'll be right there, Agent Weller.

33:25.350 --> 33:28.384
May I present to you Boston Arliss Crab.

33:37.088 --> 33:39.644
My legs are pretty close
together in this thing.

34:04.169 --> 34:07.737
Oh, I never get tired of that sound.

34:07.738 --> 34:11.239
Fool 'em once, shame on
us, fool 'em twice...

34:11.243 --> 34:13.230
I guess, technically,
still a shame on us.

34:13.231 --> 34:14.797
The eye candy's a nice touch.

34:14.799 --> 34:15.898
I thought you'd like that.

34:15.900 --> 34:18.134
So, it worked? The Akkadian's dead?

34:18.136 --> 34:20.937
Oh, the Akkadian's as dead as it gets.

34:20.938 --> 34:23.572
Kim Jong-un would have to wake
up pretty early in the morning

34:23.574 --> 34:26.109
to get one over on old Richard.com.

34:29.179 --> 34:30.947
Come on.

34:33.418 --> 34:34.917
Surprise.

34:34.918 --> 34:37.186
Out. Out.

34:38.857 --> 34:40.657
You've got to be kidding me.

34:40.659 --> 34:42.792
- You.
- Yeah.

34:47.116 --> 34:48.185
You really thought it'd be that easy?

34:48.186 --> 34:49.485
But how?

34:51.656 --> 34:53.255
The lab lady?

34:53.257 --> 34:55.456
- I'm sorry, who are you?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:55.458 --> 34:56.692
Hi.

34:56.694 --> 34:58.527
I thought she had a concussion.

34:59.530 --> 35:00.696
She good?

35:01.562 --> 35:02.758
Let's get back to the team.

35:02.758 --> 35:03.957
I've got a better idea.

35:03.959 --> 35:05.959
I never went to the infirmary.

35:05.961 --> 35:07.560
I went on a crab hunt.

35:07.562 --> 35:08.662
How did you know I was still alive?

35:08.664 --> 35:10.397
It was your death story.

35:10.399 --> 35:12.632
He died in my arms, on the beach.

35:12.634 --> 35:15.802
"Such a beautiful place
to die with you."

35:15.804 --> 35:20.507
It's how Dobby dies in "Harry
Potter and the Deathly Hallows."

35:21.161 --> 35:23.494
You made me Dobby the house-elf?

35:23.496 --> 35:25.063
Even in those books, there's
thousands of characters...

35:25.065 --> 35:26.664
Everybody loves Dobby.
What's your problem?

35:26.666 --> 35:27.765
Can you please stop embarrassing
me in front of my friends?

35:27.767 --> 35:29.438
Boys! Boys, shut up!

35:29.438 --> 35:31.635
We knew you wouldn't
be able to resist our system

35:31.636 --> 35:34.403
if you had access to it.

35:34.406 --> 35:36.806
So we culled through every server

35:36.808 --> 35:39.743
- until we found your breach.
- Bingo.

35:39.745 --> 35:42.746
Re-routing select calls
to a mystery number.

35:42.748 --> 35:45.148
Then, all we had to do
was trace the phone...

35:45.150 --> 35:47.484
We'll be right there, Agent Weller.

35:47.486 --> 35:50.520
and get two jerks for the price of one.

35:50.522 --> 35:54.691
Boom! To catch a con,
you gotta hatch a con.

35:54.693 --> 35:59.262
All right, my stubbly friend,
you and your team win.

35:59.264 --> 36:01.264
Could do without the smugness, though.

36:01.266 --> 36:03.783
It's just nice to know
that people don't change.

36:08.206 --> 36:10.940
You wanted to see me?

36:10.942 --> 36:12.842
Yes.

36:12.844 --> 36:14.844
I've been thinking about
what you asked for,

36:14.846 --> 36:16.946
about turning Roman.

36:17.520 --> 36:20.321
I'm afraid it's a risk that
we just can't afford to take.

36:20.323 --> 36:21.157
He can change.

36:21.158 --> 36:23.416
I understand where you're
coming from... I do.

36:23.417 --> 36:25.918
I know how hard this is for you, Jane.

36:25.920 --> 36:27.319
There's a lot more at stake here

36:27.321 --> 36:29.288
than just the fate of one person.

36:29.290 --> 36:32.491
Can you understand that?

36:32.493 --> 36:35.161
Thank you for considering it.

36:39.600 --> 36:41.300
Are you sure this is enough C4?

36:41.302 --> 36:44.470
It has to be, until we get more HMX.

36:47.475 --> 36:49.675
- Something wrong?
- It's our FBI mole.

36:49.677 --> 36:51.341
There's a message in the dead drop.

36:51.342 --> 36:53.108
I thought they were supposed
to keep radio silence.

36:53.110 --> 36:54.977
They were.

36:56.647 --> 36:57.947
Well, it must be urgent.

36:58.245 --> 36:59.778
What's that supposed to mean?

37:00.310 --> 37:02.330
Oh, nothing, I was just...

37:02.331 --> 37:04.498
You think my sister has betrayed us?

37:04.501 --> 37:05.233
No, I just mean...

37:05.234 --> 37:07.667
She passed our tests, she saved my life.

37:07.669 --> 37:09.869
She's done everything
we've asked of her.

37:09.871 --> 37:12.038
I know that. I wasn't...

37:12.716 --> 37:15.350
I'm sure that we can trust her.

37:15.352 --> 37:18.119
But we should tell Shepherd, right?

37:22.225 --> 37:25.493
We aren't gonna do anything.

37:26.663 --> 37:28.663
I'm gonna go to the dead drop,

37:28.665 --> 37:30.932
and I'm gonna find out for sure.

37:44.915 --> 37:46.581
Shouldn't you be at the infirmary?

37:46.583 --> 37:48.850
Tell that to the doctor
who sent me home.

37:54.825 --> 37:56.524
I thought pushing you
away was the only way

37:56.526 --> 37:58.593
I could get you to take a step back.

37:58.595 --> 37:59.761
That was a mistake.

38:02.265 --> 38:04.099
I haven't been listening to you.

38:04.101 --> 38:05.900
To what you wanna do.

38:05.902 --> 38:07.569
Sorry.

38:07.571 --> 38:10.626
You gotta promise me you'll
leave the knife alone.

38:10.626 --> 38:12.125
I can live with whatever
happens to me, but I couldn't

38:12.127 --> 38:14.594
if something were to happen to you.

38:14.596 --> 38:16.863
I promise.

38:22.583 --> 38:25.317
You changing the locks?

38:25.319 --> 38:27.519
Yeah.

38:27.521 --> 38:30.088
Dangerous people keep showing up.

38:31.160 --> 38:34.895
Listen, uh, I'm worried
about Jane because...

38:34.897 --> 38:37.731
I made the same mistake
that she wants to make.

38:37.733 --> 38:39.900
I trusted the wrong person.

38:39.902 --> 38:41.797
People died.

38:41.798 --> 38:44.198
Maybe it was wrong to
bug Borden's office.

38:44.201 --> 38:46.602
Maybe it was wrong to
support the Omaha project,

38:46.604 --> 38:51.273
but when I did what I thought
was right, I lost people.

38:51.462 --> 38:54.086
And I swore I would never
let that happen again.

38:54.914 --> 38:55.977
So, why trust me?

38:57.115 --> 38:59.615
Because I...

38:59.617 --> 39:01.884
I've lost people for other reasons.

39:03.454 --> 39:05.454
Because I can't open up.

39:05.456 --> 39:07.656
Yeah...

39:07.658 --> 39:09.959
I've had some experience with that.

39:10.883 --> 39:12.098
Well, you know, lately,

39:12.098 --> 39:14.765
I feel like I might wanna change that.

39:14.767 --> 39:16.266
Yeah?

39:16.268 --> 39:18.836
Yeah.

39:35.350 --> 39:37.742
Best-kept secret in New York.

39:37.742 --> 39:39.071
Well, one of them, anyway.

39:39.071 --> 39:40.530
So, I'm glad you called.

39:40.531 --> 39:43.197
I was starting to think
you were blowing me off.

39:43.199 --> 39:45.700
No, no, I just...

39:45.978 --> 39:47.511
I'm not great at texting, I guess.

39:47.513 --> 39:49.813
Well, neither am I, apparently.

39:51.083 --> 39:53.250
You sure you're... you're okay?

39:53.252 --> 39:55.886
Yes, yeah, I'm good.

39:58.757 --> 40:02.726
Um... we should probably get some of
the basics out of the way, right?

40:02.728 --> 40:04.176
Basics?

40:04.176 --> 40:05.776
Yeah, you know, where are you from?

40:05.778 --> 40:07.578
Do you have any brothers and sisters?

40:07.580 --> 40:10.160
Where do you work? What's
with all the tattoos

40:10.161 --> 40:12.250
that you didn't have last time?

40:12.251 --> 40:13.784
The basics.

40:16.904 --> 40:18.467
I'll go first.

40:18.467 --> 40:21.289
Sydney. Two younger sisters.

40:21.290 --> 40:22.656
A bunch of environmental non-profits

40:22.658 --> 40:24.058
that can't afford to pay me.

40:24.060 --> 40:26.627
And, uh, don't have any tattoos.

40:26.629 --> 40:29.697
Well, except for a little
butterfly on my lower back.

40:32.068 --> 40:34.201
Now, your turn.

40:35.238 --> 40:37.471
Um...

40:41.744 --> 40:44.845
Oliver, I...

40:44.847 --> 40:47.148
I'm sorry, I can't do this.

40:47.150 --> 40:49.350
What? Why?

40:49.352 --> 40:53.120
Just... this doesn't belong to me.

40:53.122 --> 40:55.823
Doesn't belong? Jane, what did I do?

40:55.825 --> 40:58.192
Nothing, you didn't do anything wrong.

40:58.194 --> 41:01.729
Uh... you seem really nice. I'm sorry.

41:06.836 --> 41:08.802
Definitely, let's catch up over drinks.

41:08.804 --> 41:10.371
I'll, um, I'll text you.

41:49.979 --> 41:51.708
Say good-bye for me, will ya?
