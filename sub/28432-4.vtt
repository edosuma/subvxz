00:08.801 --> 00:10.217
Who would you say is the father?

00:10.635 --> 00:11.718
You.

00:12.760 --> 00:15.259
I'm going to put a prince
in your belly.

00:17.551 --> 00:21.009
Our queen has a keen sense
of poetic justice.

00:21.092 --> 00:22.509
What would she do for the man

00:22.593 --> 00:24.718
who rids her
of her treasonous brothers?

00:25.593 --> 00:28.092
My name...
my real name...

00:28.760 --> 00:30.217
is Aegon Targaryen.

00:30.885 --> 00:31.967
It's true, Dany.

00:32.468 --> 00:33.635
If it were true...

00:34.259 --> 00:35.739
you'd have a claim
to the Iron Throne.

00:36.426 --> 00:38.426
She doesn't like
your queen, does she?

00:38.843 --> 00:40.468
She's defending our family.

00:40.760 --> 00:42.134
I'm her family, too.

00:43.676 --> 00:44.885
Don't forget that.

05:26.967 --> 05:30.217
We're here to say goodbye
to our brothers and sisters.

05:31.217 --> 05:33.551
To our fathers and mothers.

05:35.384 --> 05:36.509
To our friends.

05:38.134 --> 05:39.967
Our fellow men and women

05:40.051 --> 05:42.676
who set aside
their differences...

05:44.092 --> 05:45.593
to fight together...

05:47.259 --> 05:49.760
and die together

05:49.843 --> 05:51.801
so that others might live.

05:54.384 --> 05:56.718
Everyone in this world

05:56.801 --> 05:59.593
owes them a debt
that can never be repaid.

06:01.051 --> 06:03.967
It is our duty and our honor

06:04.051 --> 06:07.259
to keep them alive in memory...

06:08.426 --> 06:10.134
for those who come after us...

06:11.343 --> 06:13.259
and those
who come after them...

06:15.134 --> 06:18.134
for as long as men draw breath.

06:20.051 --> 06:23.551
They were the shields
that guarded the realms of men.

06:24.926 --> 06:27.760
And we shall never see
their like again.

08:59.259 --> 09:00.885
To your health.

09:27.885 --> 09:29.343
Have you seen Arya?

09:30.885 --> 09:32.718
You can still smell
the burning bodies,

09:32.801 --> 09:34.301
and that's
where your head is at.

09:34.384 --> 09:37.384
- I just want to thank her for...
- I'm sure you do.

09:37.468 --> 09:38.718
Look, it's not about that.

09:38.801 --> 09:40.551
Of course it's about that,
you twat.

09:40.635 --> 09:41.718
Why shouldn't it be?

09:41.801 --> 09:45.009
The dead are dead. You're not.

09:58.343 --> 09:59.843
Gendry.

10:02.259 --> 10:03.676
That's right, isn't it?

10:10.176 --> 10:11.259
Yes, Your Grace.

10:11.343 --> 10:13.551
You're Robert Baratheon's son.

10:19.926 --> 10:21.885
You are aware
he took my family's throne

10:21.967 --> 10:24.301
and tried to have me murdered?

10:24.384 --> 10:27.926
I didn't even know he was my
father until after he was dead.

10:28.009 --> 10:31.217
Yes, he's dead.

10:31.301 --> 10:32.885
His brothers are too.

10:34.343 --> 10:37.009
So who's Lord
of Storm's End now?

10:38.760 --> 10:40.009
I don't know, Your Grace.

10:40.092 --> 10:41.926
Does anyone?

10:52.217 --> 10:54.593
I think you should be
Lord of Storm's End.

11:00.301 --> 11:01.551
I can't be. I'm a bastard.

11:01.635 --> 11:06.134
No, you are Lord
Gendry Baratheon of Storm's End,

11:06.217 --> 11:09.384
the lawful son
of Robert Baratheon.

11:09.468 --> 11:12.217
Because that
is what I have made you.

11:21.259 --> 11:25.176
To Lord Gendry Baratheon
of Storm's End.

11:25.259 --> 11:27.468
To Gendry!

11:27.551 --> 11:29.760
Lord Gendry!

11:29.843 --> 11:31.760
Gendry!

11:31.843 --> 11:34.259
- Gendry!
- Gendry!

11:36.176 --> 11:37.926
Lord Gendry!

11:39.259 --> 11:40.259
Gendry!

11:43.426 --> 11:45.217
That's easy, isn't it?

11:47.551 --> 11:50.676
- A fitting reward for a hero.
- Uh, hold on.

11:50.760 --> 11:54.551
And a Lord of Storm's End
who will be forever loyal to you.

11:54.635 --> 11:56.468
- Come, my lord.
- See?

11:56.551 --> 11:58.926
You're not the only one
who's clever.

12:08.635 --> 12:11.593
I have to go down and get another barrel.

12:14.926 --> 12:17.801
We fought dead things
and lived to talk about it.

12:17.885 --> 12:21.092
If this isn't the time to drink,
when is?

12:31.384 --> 12:32.926
The last time I saw her,

12:33.009 --> 12:36.301
I told her I'd kill her
if I ever saw her again.

12:36.384 --> 12:39.134
- I'm sure you had your reasons.
- I did.

12:39.217 --> 12:41.676
- I do.
- So did you?

12:43.843 --> 12:45.760
Never got the chance.

12:45.843 --> 12:47.343
She did it to herself.

12:49.593 --> 12:51.509
Or her god did it to her.

12:54.051 --> 12:55.718
Lord of Light.

12:55.801 --> 13:00.092
We play his game for him,
we fight his war and win,

13:00.176 --> 13:01.801
and then

13:01.885 --> 13:03.176
he fucks off.

13:03.259 --> 13:06.635
No signs, no blessings.
Who knows what he wants?

13:08.134 --> 13:10.217
I don't imagine
thinking about that subject

13:10.301 --> 13:12.092
will leave you
any happier than before.

13:12.176 --> 13:14.343
And what if
I'm not trying to be happy?

13:16.676 --> 13:17.801
Then you're in luck.

13:20.301 --> 13:22.718
We may have defeated them,

13:22.801 --> 13:25.718
but we still have us
to contend with.

13:30.676 --> 13:32.760
Thank you. I feel much better.

13:46.384 --> 13:47.426
More ale!

13:50.009 --> 13:51.343
This is clever.

13:52.760 --> 13:55.217
Even better than the saddle
I designed for you.

13:56.551 --> 13:58.843
It's the same as the one
Daeron Targaryen built

13:58.926 --> 14:02.593
for his crippled nephew
120 years ago.

14:02.676 --> 14:04.509
I liked that one.

14:04.593 --> 14:07.760
You know our history
better than anyone.

14:07.843 --> 14:10.967
That will be useful
as Lord of Winterfell.

14:11.051 --> 14:13.009
I'm not Lord of Winterfell.

14:13.092 --> 14:16.092
You're the only surviving
trueborn son of Ned Stark.

14:20.967 --> 14:22.551
You don't want it.

14:22.635 --> 14:25.051
I don't really want anymore.

14:27.092 --> 14:28.426
I envy you.

14:31.426 --> 14:33.259
You shouldn't envy me.

14:34.760 --> 14:36.760
Mostly I live in the past.

14:42.134 --> 14:43.551
- All of it.
- Go on.

14:43.635 --> 14:46.217
- No, not in one go.
- Go on. I believe in you.

14:46.301 --> 14:48.343
We have to celebrate our victory.

14:48.426 --> 14:50.718
Vomiting is not celebrating.

14:50.801 --> 14:52.593
Yes, it is.

14:52.676 --> 14:53.967
Ah!

14:54.051 --> 14:55.551
To the Dragon Queen!

14:57.967 --> 15:01.092
To Arya Stark,
the hero of Winterfell!

15:04.676 --> 15:06.885
- Rah! Rah! Rah! Rah!
- Drink!

15:19.635 --> 15:21.468
I'm fine!

15:34.843 --> 15:35.843
Your turn.

15:35.926 --> 15:37.509
Um...

15:38.384 --> 15:41.509
You are an only child.

15:42.635 --> 15:44.259
- I told you I was.
- You didn't.

15:44.343 --> 15:47.176
- I did.
- I surmised it.

15:47.259 --> 15:48.801
Drink.

15:49.801 --> 15:51.051
Go again.

15:51.134 --> 15:52.468
Why does he get to go again?

15:52.551 --> 15:54.426
Because it's my game.

15:54.509 --> 15:58.134
You have danced
with Renly Baratheon.

16:00.176 --> 16:01.009
No.

16:01.092 --> 16:02.468
Drink.

16:03.593 --> 16:05.384
The other way around!

16:05.468 --> 16:07.676
I saw him riding that thing.

16:07.760 --> 16:10.509
- We all did.
- No. No.

16:10.593 --> 16:13.843
I saw him riding that thing.

16:13.926 --> 16:15.926
- That's right, you did.
- I did.

16:16.009 --> 16:19.760
That's why we all agreed
to follow him.

16:19.843 --> 16:22.051
That's the kind of man he is.

16:23.801 --> 16:25.217
He's little...

16:26.217 --> 16:27.801
...but he's strong.

16:27.885 --> 16:30.760
Strong enough
to befriend an enemy

16:30.843 --> 16:32.092
and get murdered for it!

16:33.176 --> 16:35.468
Most people get bloody murdered,

16:35.551 --> 16:36.760
they stay that way.

16:36.843 --> 16:38.468
Not this one.

16:40.051 --> 16:42.259
Yeah,
I didn't have much say in that.

16:42.343 --> 16:45.384
Ah! He comes back
and keeps fighting.

16:45.468 --> 16:48.967
Here, north of the Wall,
and then back here again.

16:49.051 --> 16:52.509
He keeps fighting.
He keeps fighting.

16:52.593 --> 16:55.509
He climbed on a fucking dragon
and fought.

16:55.593 --> 16:58.176
What kind of person
climbs on a fucking dragon?

16:58.259 --> 17:01.509
A madman or a king!

17:16.092 --> 17:18.843
- Drink.
- Drink.

17:18.925 --> 17:19.925
Drink.

17:50.593 --> 17:51.676
Wrong!

17:51.760 --> 17:53.843
Wrong, wrong, wrong! Drink!

17:55.967 --> 17:57.134
Mm!

17:57.217 --> 18:00.468
You were married. Before Sansa.

18:01.343 --> 18:02.635
Drink.

18:07.760 --> 18:09.885
You're drinking wine,
but you prefer ale!

18:09.967 --> 18:10.967
No!

18:24.801 --> 18:25.843
You're a virgin.

18:31.384 --> 18:33.092
That's a statement
about the present.

18:33.176 --> 18:36.092
At no point in the past,
up until this very moment,

18:36.176 --> 18:38.176
have you slept with a man.

18:39.801 --> 18:40.843
Or a woman.

18:47.217 --> 18:49.009
I have to piss.

18:49.092 --> 18:53.092
We did it!
We faced those icy fucks.

18:53.176 --> 18:55.760
Looked right
into their blue eyes,

18:55.843 --> 18:57.217
and here we are.

18:58.676 --> 19:02.134
Now, which one of you cowards
shit in my pants?

19:05.801 --> 19:07.967
Please pardon me for a moment.

19:27.593 --> 19:29.009
Drink it!

19:50.426 --> 19:52.593
And after all that,

19:52.676 --> 19:56.217
this fucker comes north
and takes her from me.

19:56.301 --> 19:58.217
Just takes her, like that.

20:00.217 --> 20:01.843
I mean it, Clegane.

20:01.926 --> 20:03.509
My heart is broken.

20:03.593 --> 20:04.843
Don't touch me.

20:04.926 --> 20:06.259
You can touch me.

20:07.551 --> 20:09.593
I'm not afraid of wildlings.

20:09.676 --> 20:11.426
Maybe you should be.

20:15.760 --> 20:17.051
Well, Clegane...

20:18.176 --> 20:20.676
it's time to drown our sorrows.

20:20.760 --> 20:22.426
I'm not done with my drink.

20:23.551 --> 20:25.426
You saved the day.

20:25.509 --> 20:26.885
You owe me one.

20:26.967 --> 20:30.468
- Don't forget that.
- For the rest of my days.

20:31.885 --> 20:33.051
Are you ready now?

20:33.134 --> 20:35.259
This is my drink.

20:40.801 --> 20:42.509
All right!

20:50.259 --> 20:53.301
She could have made you happy,
for a little while.

20:56.259 --> 20:58.801
There's only one thing
that'll make me happy.

20:59.801 --> 21:00.718
And what's that?

21:00.801 --> 21:03.176
That's my fucking business.

21:07.885 --> 21:10.718
Used to be
you couldn't look at me.

21:10.801 --> 21:13.051
That was a long time ago.

21:13.134 --> 21:15.843
I've seen much worse than you
since then.

21:15.926 --> 21:17.885
Yes, I've heard.

21:17.967 --> 21:19.718
Heard you were broken in.

21:20.718 --> 21:22.343
Heard you were broken in rough.

21:23.468 --> 21:25.801
And he got what he deserved.

21:25.885 --> 21:27.217
I gave it to him.

21:28.593 --> 21:29.635
How?

21:30.926 --> 21:32.051
Hounds.

21:35.885 --> 21:37.551
You've changed, Little Bird.

21:44.009 --> 21:45.384
None of it would have happened

21:45.468 --> 21:47.301
if you'd left King's Landing
with me.

21:47.384 --> 21:50.384
No Littlefinger, no Ramsay...

21:52.009 --> 21:53.259
none of it.

22:01.635 --> 22:04.176
Without Littlefinger,
and Ramsay and the rest,

22:04.259 --> 22:06.760
I would have stayed
a Little Bird all my life.

22:28.259 --> 22:31.384
- Hey!
- Pour another one.

22:43.801 --> 22:44.967
Don't shoot.

22:48.009 --> 22:50.885
It's nighttime, it's freezing,
and everyone's celebrating.

22:50.967 --> 22:53.468
You should be celebrating
with them.

22:53.551 --> 22:54.926
I am celebrating.

22:56.801 --> 22:58.760
Yeah, I am too.

23:01.009 --> 23:02.926
I'm not Gendry Rivers anymore.

23:03.009 --> 23:06.384
I'm Gendry Baratheon,
Lord of Storm's End.

23:06.468 --> 23:08.801
By order of the queen.

23:10.509 --> 23:11.801
Congratulations.

23:15.092 --> 23:17.051
I don't know how to be
lord of anything.

23:17.134 --> 23:18.760
I hardly know
how to use a fork.

23:18.843 --> 23:20.760
All I know
is that you're beautiful,

23:20.843 --> 23:21.967
and I love you,

23:22.051 --> 23:23.885
and none of it
will be worth anything

23:23.967 --> 23:25.134
if you're not with me.

23:26.468 --> 23:27.468
So be with me.

23:31.967 --> 23:35.593
Be my wife.
Be the Lady of Storm's End.

23:57.676 --> 24:00.092
You'll be a wonderful lord,

24:00.176 --> 24:03.217
and any lady
would be lucky to have you.

24:04.593 --> 24:06.051
But I'm not a lady.

24:07.468 --> 24:08.843
I never have been.

24:11.176 --> 24:12.176
That's not me.

24:38.343 --> 24:39.718
You didn't drink.

24:42.551 --> 24:45.593
- I didn't drink?
- In the game.

24:45.676 --> 24:48.843
- I drank.
- In the game. This is Dornish.

24:51.718 --> 24:55.259
This is not the game.
This is only drinking.

24:56.301 --> 24:57.426
Suit yourself.

25:08.384 --> 25:10.760
You keep it
warm enough in here.

25:14.134 --> 25:17.134
It's the first thing I learnt
when I came to the North.

25:17.217 --> 25:18.593
Keep your fire going.

25:18.676 --> 25:21.009
Every time you leave the room,
put more wood on.

25:21.092 --> 25:23.718
That's very diligent.
Very responsible.

25:23.801 --> 25:25.676
- Piss off.
- You know the first thing

25:25.760 --> 25:27.551
I learned in the North?

25:27.635 --> 25:29.718
I hate the fucking North.

25:30.885 --> 25:32.092
It grows on you.

25:33.801 --> 25:36.426
I don't want things
growing on me.

25:37.676 --> 25:41.009
How about Tormund Giantsbane?

25:41.092 --> 25:42.593
Has he grown on you?

25:44.259 --> 25:46.259
He was very sad when you left.

25:47.760 --> 25:49.593
You sound quite jealous.

25:52.426 --> 25:53.926
I do, don't I?

25:58.967 --> 26:00.801
It's bloody hot in here.

26:10.593 --> 26:11.967
Oh, move aside.

26:17.635 --> 26:18.676
What are you doing?

26:19.676 --> 26:21.134
I'm taking your shirt off.

27:08.009 --> 27:10.343
I've never slept with
a knight before.

27:11.593 --> 27:14.301
I've never slept
with anyone before.

27:16.217 --> 27:18.926
Then you have to drink.
Those are the rules.

27:20.009 --> 27:21.384
I told you...

27:36.885 --> 27:38.384
Are you drunk?

27:43.051 --> 27:44.051
No.

27:49.051 --> 27:50.343
Only a little.

28:00.509 --> 28:02.217
I didn't know Ser Jorah well...

28:03.635 --> 28:04.885
but I know this.

28:06.593 --> 28:08.509
If he could have chosen
a way to die,

28:08.593 --> 28:10.593
it would have been
protecting you.

28:11.635 --> 28:12.635
He loved me.

28:15.593 --> 28:17.718
And I couldn't love him back.

28:19.801 --> 28:21.551
Not the way he wanted.

28:25.009 --> 28:26.635
Not the way I love you.

28:29.760 --> 28:31.217
Is that all right?

29:10.509 --> 29:12.593
I wish you'd never told me.

29:13.843 --> 29:16.635
If I didn't know,
I'd be happy right now.

29:18.092 --> 29:19.301
I try to forget.

29:20.967 --> 29:22.343
Tonight I did for a while,

29:22.426 --> 29:25.217
and then I saw them
gathered around you.

29:26.509 --> 29:29.051
I saw the way
they looked at you.

29:30.134 --> 29:31.509
I know that look.

29:33.176 --> 29:36.676
So many people have looked at me
that way, but never here.

29:36.760 --> 29:38.343
Never on this side of the sea.

29:39.801 --> 29:41.092
I told you I don't want it.

29:41.176 --> 29:43.718
It doesn't matter what you want.

29:43.801 --> 29:45.593
You didn't want to be
King in the North.

29:45.676 --> 29:48.259
What happens when they demand
you press your claim,

29:48.343 --> 29:49.843
and take what is mine?

29:53.301 --> 29:55.134
I'll refuse.

29:55.217 --> 29:57.760
You are my queen. I don't know
what else I can say.

29:57.843 --> 30:00.051
You can say nothing.

30:00.134 --> 30:01.593
To anyone, ever.

30:01.676 --> 30:03.676
Never tell them
who you really are.

30:03.760 --> 30:06.176
Swear your brother
and Samwell Tarly to secrecy,

30:06.259 --> 30:07.468
and tell no one else.

30:07.551 --> 30:09.176
Or it will take on
a life of its own

30:09.259 --> 30:10.967
and you won't be able
to control it

30:11.051 --> 30:12.259
or what it does to people.

30:12.343 --> 30:14.843
No matter how many times
you bend the knee,

30:14.926 --> 30:16.885
no matter what you swear.

30:22.051 --> 30:25.509
I want it to be the way it was
between us.

30:34.718 --> 30:36.509
I have to tell Sansa and Arya.

30:36.593 --> 30:42.967
Sansa will want to see me gone
and you on the Iron Throne.

30:43.051 --> 30:44.718
She won't.

30:44.801 --> 30:47.843
She's not the girl
you grew up with.

30:47.926 --> 30:50.217
Not after what she's seen,

30:50.301 --> 30:52.926
not after
what they've done to her.

30:56.301 --> 30:58.176
I owe them the truth.

30:58.259 --> 31:01.134
Even if the truth destroys us?

31:01.217 --> 31:02.926
- It won't.
- It will.

31:05.468 --> 31:07.259
I've never begged
for anything...

31:08.509 --> 31:10.676
but I'm begging you.

31:10.760 --> 31:13.760
Don't do this. Please.

31:20.384 --> 31:21.760
You are my queen.

31:23.343 --> 31:25.217
Nothing will change that.

31:28.134 --> 31:29.843
And they are my family.

31:31.801 --> 31:33.468
We can live together.

31:39.384 --> 31:40.384
We can.

31:42.551 --> 31:44.301
I've just told you how.

32:20.426 --> 32:22.301
Half are gone.

32:26.134 --> 32:27.635
The Northmen as well.

32:34.009 --> 32:37.176
And the Golden Company
has arrived in King's Landing,

32:37.259 --> 32:39.259
courtesy of the Greyjoy fleet.

32:39.343 --> 32:43.051
The balance has grown
distressingly even.

32:43.134 --> 32:45.926
When the people find out
what we have done for them,

32:46.009 --> 32:47.259
that we saved them...

32:47.343 --> 32:49.676
Cersei will make sure
they don't believe it.

32:51.676 --> 32:53.301
We will hit her hard.

32:53.384 --> 32:55.593
We will rip her out
root and stem.

32:57.051 --> 32:59.676
The objective here
is to remove Cersei

32:59.760 --> 33:02.426
without destroying
King's Landing.

33:05.551 --> 33:09.384
Thankfully,
she's losing allies by the day.

33:09.468 --> 33:12.301
Yara Greyjoy has retaken
the Iron Islands

33:12.384 --> 33:13.676
in her queen's name.

33:13.760 --> 33:16.426
The new Prince of Dorne
pledges his support.

33:16.509 --> 33:18.551
No matter how many lords
turn against her,

33:18.635 --> 33:20.426
as long as she sits
on the Iron Throne,

33:20.509 --> 33:23.217
she can call herself
Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

33:25.551 --> 33:27.301
We need the capital.

33:27.384 --> 33:29.134
I watched the people
of King's Landing

33:29.217 --> 33:31.509
rebel against their king
when they were hungry,

33:31.593 --> 33:33.801
and that was before
winter began.

33:33.885 --> 33:37.426
Give them the opportunity
and they will cast Cersei aside.

33:39.134 --> 33:41.509
We'll surround the city.

33:41.593 --> 33:43.843
If the Iron Fleet
tries to ferry in more food,

33:43.926 --> 33:46.009
the dragons will destroy them.

33:46.092 --> 33:48.509
If the Lannisters
and the Golden Company attack,

33:48.593 --> 33:50.259
we'll defeat them in the field.

33:50.343 --> 33:54.009
Once the people see
that Cersei is our only enemy,

33:54.092 --> 33:56.092
her reign is over.

34:01.259 --> 34:02.718
All right.

34:02.801 --> 34:05.926
The men we have left are exhausted.

34:06.009 --> 34:07.217
Many of them are wounded.

34:07.301 --> 34:09.176
They'll fight better
if they have time

34:09.259 --> 34:10.635
to rest and recuperate.

34:11.926 --> 34:13.134
How long do you suggest?

34:14.301 --> 34:15.801
I can't say for certain,

34:15.885 --> 34:17.926
not without
talking to the officers.

34:21.301 --> 34:24.176
I came north
to fight alongside you

34:24.259 --> 34:26.801
at great cost
to my armies and myself.

34:28.051 --> 34:30.885
Now that the time has come
to reciprocate,

34:30.967 --> 34:32.760
you want to postpone.

34:32.842 --> 34:35.717
It's not just our people.
It's yours.

34:35.801 --> 34:37.426
You want to throw them
into a war

34:37.509 --> 34:39.051
they're not ready to fight?

34:39.134 --> 34:40.842
The longer I leave
my enemies alone,

34:40.926 --> 34:42.426
the stronger they become.

34:45.967 --> 34:49.509
The Northern forces
will honor their promises

34:49.592 --> 34:50.885
and their allegiance

34:50.967 --> 34:53.467
to the Queen
of the Seven Kingdoms.

34:58.843 --> 35:00.676
What you command, we will obey.

35:05.426 --> 35:07.009
So...

35:07.092 --> 35:10.009
if all are in agreement...

35:10.092 --> 35:12.926
Jon and Ser Davos
will ride down the Kingsroad

35:13.009 --> 35:14.384
with the Northern troops

35:14.468 --> 35:17.009
and the bulk of the remaining
Dothraki and Unsullied.

35:17.092 --> 35:19.426
A smaller group of us
will ride to White Harbor,

35:19.509 --> 35:21.426
and sail from there
to Dragonstone

35:21.509 --> 35:25.217
with our queen and her dragons
accompanying us from above.

35:25.301 --> 35:27.967
Ser Jaime has chosen
to remain here,

35:28.051 --> 35:30.343
as a guest
of the Lady of Winterfell.

35:33.384 --> 35:35.301
We have won the Great War.

35:36.301 --> 35:38.051
Now we will win the Last War.

35:39.343 --> 35:41.343
In all Seven Kingdoms,

35:41.426 --> 35:44.217
men will live
without fear and cruelty

35:45.301 --> 35:46.718
under their rightful queen.

36:00.176 --> 36:01.343
We need a word.

36:05.468 --> 36:08.426
You understand we'd all be dead
if not for her.

36:08.509 --> 36:10.801
We'd be corpses
marching down to King's Landing.

36:10.885 --> 36:12.360
Arya's the one
that killed the Night King.

36:12.384 --> 36:14.468
Her men gave their lives
defending Winterfell...

36:14.551 --> 36:16.134
And we will never forget them.

36:16.217 --> 36:18.152
That doesn't mean that I want
to kneel to someone who...

36:18.176 --> 36:20.843
I swore myself and the North
to her cause.

36:20.926 --> 36:22.468
I respect that.

36:25.092 --> 36:26.760
You respect it?

36:27.468 --> 36:29.217
We needed her.

36:30.593 --> 36:33.217
We needed her army, her dragons.

36:35.009 --> 36:36.801
You did the right thing.

36:36.885 --> 36:39.301
And we're doing the right thing
telling you

36:39.384 --> 36:40.926
we don't trust your queen.

36:42.843 --> 36:45.134
- You don't know her yet.
- I'll never know her.

36:45.217 --> 36:46.509
She's not one of us.

36:46.593 --> 36:48.509
If you only trust the people
you grew up with,

36:48.593 --> 36:49.926
you won't make many allies.

36:50.009 --> 36:51.551
That's all right.

36:51.635 --> 36:53.760
I don't need many allies.

36:53.843 --> 36:56.092
- Arya...
- We're family.

36:57.426 --> 36:58.635
The four of us.

36:59.718 --> 37:01.426
The last of the Starks.

37:05.468 --> 37:06.926
I've never been a Stark.

37:08.092 --> 37:09.676
You are.

37:09.760 --> 37:12.760
You're just as much
Ned Stark's child as any of us.

37:12.843 --> 37:14.718
You're my brother.

37:14.801 --> 37:17.301
Not my half-brother
or my bastard brother.

37:18.134 --> 37:19.676
My brother.

37:27.217 --> 37:28.967
It's your choice.

37:36.134 --> 37:38.343
I need to tell you something.

37:39.843 --> 37:43.343
But you have to swear
you'll never tell another soul.

37:46.635 --> 37:47.967
What is it?

37:49.259 --> 37:52.301
You have to swear it,
before I tell you.

37:52.384 --> 37:53.967
How can I promise
to keep a secret

37:54.051 --> 37:55.593
if I don't even
know what it is?

37:55.676 --> 37:57.343
Because we're family.

38:02.426 --> 38:03.426
Swear it.

38:04.718 --> 38:06.134
I swear it.

38:10.801 --> 38:11.801
I swear it.

38:19.843 --> 38:21.134
Tell them.

38:31.676 --> 38:34.217
So she's going to stay here with you?

38:36.676 --> 38:39.885
She's sworn to protect
the Stark girls, so...

38:43.217 --> 38:44.676
Say something snide.

38:45.885 --> 38:46.885
I'm happy.

38:46.967 --> 38:48.718
I'm happy that you're happy.

38:51.635 --> 38:55.009
I'm happy that you'll finally
have to climb for it.

38:57.051 --> 39:00.343
Do you know how long I've waited
to tell tall-person jokes?

39:01.551 --> 39:03.843
To climbing mountains.

39:03.926 --> 39:05.384
To climbing mountains.

39:07.967 --> 39:10.967
- What's she like down there?
- What?

39:11.051 --> 39:13.009
That's not your concern.

39:13.092 --> 39:15.635
I haven't been with a woman
for years.

39:15.718 --> 39:17.217
- Give me a morsel.
- You're a dog.

39:17.301 --> 39:19.176
I am the Imp,
and I demand to know.

39:19.259 --> 39:21.051
I knew you were fucking her.

39:22.967 --> 39:24.885
A pair of tall, blond toffs.

39:24.967 --> 39:26.635
Must be like
looking in the mirror.

39:26.718 --> 39:28.551
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

39:30.176 --> 39:31.926
Where's your drink?

39:32.009 --> 39:34.134
What are you...
What are you doing up North?

39:34.217 --> 39:35.676
What are you doing with that?

39:35.760 --> 39:37.301
Oh, this?

39:37.384 --> 39:38.426
This is for you.

39:39.926 --> 39:41.009
For both of you.

39:41.092 --> 39:43.176
You're supposed to be south.

39:43.259 --> 39:45.176
You boys are a pair
of gold-plated cunts.

39:45.259 --> 39:46.819
- Do you know that?
- That's a bit rude.

39:46.843 --> 39:49.051
Year after year,
I've shoveled Lannister shit,

39:49.134 --> 39:52.051
- and what do I have to show?
- You're a knight, thanks to me.

39:52.134 --> 39:53.777
Thanks to me.
And that title's worth as much

39:53.801 --> 39:56.009
as a blond hair
from your brother's ballsack.

39:56.092 --> 39:57.676
Power resides
where men believe...

39:57.760 --> 39:59.718
Shut your mouth.

39:59.801 --> 40:02.134
- I'm just trying...
- I've never hit a dwarf before,

40:02.217 --> 40:04.092
but say another word
and I will belt you.

40:04.176 --> 40:06.718
See, I don't believe
you'd do that, after all...

40:06.801 --> 40:08.551
You couldn't do it
on your best day,

40:08.635 --> 40:09.718
you one-handed fuck.

40:09.801 --> 40:11.384
And your best days
are long gone.

40:11.468 --> 40:12.967
You broke my nose!

40:13.051 --> 40:14.819
- I did not break your nose.
- How do you know?

40:14.843 --> 40:17.134
Because I've been breaking noses
since I was your size,

40:17.217 --> 40:20.134
and I know what it sounds like.
Now listen.

40:20.217 --> 40:22.801
Your sister
offered me Riverrun.

40:22.885 --> 40:24.384
Nice big castle, good lands,

40:24.468 --> 40:26.509
plenty of peasants
who do what they're told.

40:26.593 --> 40:29.259
- And you trust Cersei...
- I knew your sister was dead

40:29.343 --> 40:31.134
the second I saw those dragons.

40:31.217 --> 40:32.801
Now,
your army may be torn to shit,

40:32.885 --> 40:35.092
but I'd still bet
on your Dragon Queen to win.

40:35.176 --> 40:37.676
And it just so happens
I'm a betting man.

40:38.926 --> 40:41.843
If Cersei's dead,
she can't pay up.

40:44.176 --> 40:46.343
Mmm, that's good.
Of course, the odds change

40:46.426 --> 40:48.426
if the Dragon Queen's Hand
turns up dead.

40:48.509 --> 40:51.384
Maybe a few of her top generals
get picked off one by one.

40:51.468 --> 40:53.384
- All of a sudden...
- May I speak?

40:53.468 --> 40:56.134
Why not?
Only death will shut you up.

40:59.509 --> 41:02.343
We made a deal long ago.
Do you remember?

41:02.426 --> 41:03.593
If anyone offered me money

41:03.676 --> 41:05.926
to kill you,
you'd pay me double.

41:06.009 --> 41:07.468
What's double Riverrun?

41:08.509 --> 41:09.509
Highgarden.

41:11.676 --> 41:13.176
You could be Lord of the Reach.

41:13.259 --> 41:16.092
- Highgarden? Are you mad?
- It's better than being dead.

41:16.176 --> 41:17.384
He's not going to kill us.

41:17.468 --> 41:19.217
He wouldn't be
talking to us if...

41:22.217 --> 41:23.468
The way I see it,

41:23.551 --> 41:26.217
I only need one
of the Lannister brothers alive.

41:26.301 --> 41:28.426
Highgarden will never belong
to a cutthroat.

41:28.509 --> 41:30.635
No? Who were your ancestors,

41:30.718 --> 41:32.885
the ones
who made your family rich?

41:32.967 --> 41:34.551
Fancy lads in silk?

41:34.635 --> 41:36.301
They were fucking cutthroats.

41:36.384 --> 41:38.801
That's how all the great houses
started, isn't it?

41:38.885 --> 41:41.301
With a hard bastard
who was good at killing people.

41:41.384 --> 41:43.718
Kill a few hundred people,
they make you a lord.

41:43.801 --> 41:45.801
Kill a few thousand,
they make you king.

41:45.885 --> 41:50.301
And then all your cocksucking
grandsons can ruin the family

41:50.384 --> 41:51.926
with their cocksucking ways.

41:55.760 --> 41:56.760
Highgarden.

41:58.551 --> 42:00.092
Give me your word.

42:01.843 --> 42:03.301
You have my word.

42:05.176 --> 42:08.551
None of this means a thing
until we take King's Landing.

42:09.676 --> 42:12.092
We ride south in the morning.

42:12.176 --> 42:13.343
We could use an officer

42:13.426 --> 42:15.676
with knowledge
of the city's defenses.

42:15.760 --> 42:17.009
Oh, no.

42:17.092 --> 42:19.676
No, my fighting days are done.

42:19.760 --> 42:22.801
But I still got a few
killing days left, you hear me?

42:22.885 --> 42:25.509
I'll come find you
when the war is done.

42:25.593 --> 42:27.885
Till then, don't die.

42:52.676 --> 42:54.801
For fuck's sake.

42:56.343 --> 42:57.426
On your own?

42:58.635 --> 43:00.134
Not anymore.

43:01.635 --> 43:03.259
I don't like crowds.

43:04.926 --> 43:05.967
Me neither.

43:07.176 --> 43:09.343
Why not? They all love you now.

43:09.426 --> 43:11.009
You're the big hero.

43:12.176 --> 43:13.760
Don't like heroes.

43:15.718 --> 43:19.176
It must have felt good sticking
a knife in that horned fucker.

43:20.468 --> 43:22.176
Felt better than dying.

43:25.635 --> 43:27.343
You're heading
to King's Landing?

43:28.635 --> 43:31.051
I have some
unfinished business.

43:32.384 --> 43:33.801
Me too.

43:39.885 --> 43:42.009
I don't plan on coming back.

43:44.384 --> 43:46.009
Neither do I.

43:47.635 --> 43:50.009
Gonna leave me to die again
if I get hurt?

43:52.343 --> 43:53.343
Probably.

44:37.551 --> 44:38.551
My lady.

44:42.801 --> 44:45.551
"My lord"
is the standard response.

44:47.967 --> 44:49.384
Why her?

44:53.426 --> 44:55.426
You know she loves your brother.

44:55.509 --> 44:57.635
That doesn't mean
she'll be a good queen.

44:58.843 --> 45:01.551
You seem determined
to dislike her.

45:03.009 --> 45:04.176
A good relationship

45:04.259 --> 45:05.652
between the Iron Throne
and the North

45:05.676 --> 45:07.426
has been the core
of every peaceful,

45:07.509 --> 45:09.092
prosperous reign
we've ever known.

45:09.176 --> 45:10.676
Jon will be
Warden of the North,

45:10.760 --> 45:12.760
so a good relationship
seems likely.

45:14.468 --> 45:17.676
I don't expect him to spend
much time here going forward.

45:17.760 --> 45:19.760
Well,
I suppose that's up to him.

45:24.092 --> 45:25.468
Sansa, look at me.

45:31.217 --> 45:33.384
With Jon in the capital,

45:33.468 --> 45:36.134
you'll be the true power
in the North.

45:36.217 --> 45:38.009
I'd feel much better
about the future

45:38.092 --> 45:39.426
if I left here today believing

45:39.509 --> 45:41.092
that you and Daenerys
were allies.

45:41.176 --> 45:44.926
What are you worried about?
Jon's taking our army with him.

45:45.009 --> 45:46.676
Your queen
still has her dragons...

45:46.760 --> 45:47.926
She's your queen too.

45:54.967 --> 45:57.217
You don't have to be her friend.

45:57.301 --> 45:59.217
But why provoke her?

45:59.301 --> 46:01.551
How is that in the best interest
of your family,

46:01.635 --> 46:04.051
- or the North, or...?
- You're afraid of her.

46:06.509 --> 46:10.843
Every good ruler
needs to inspire a bit of fear.

46:13.426 --> 46:15.718
I don't want Jon
to go down there.

46:15.801 --> 46:19.468
The men in my family
don't do well in the capital.

46:19.551 --> 46:22.259
No, but as your brother
once told me,

46:22.343 --> 46:23.718
he's not a Stark.

46:29.301 --> 46:30.676
Are you all right?

46:37.176 --> 46:39.760
Her people love her,
you've seen that.

46:39.843 --> 46:42.176
You've seen
how they fight for her.

46:42.259 --> 46:45.426
She wants to make the world
a better place.

46:47.760 --> 46:49.843
I believe in her.

47:04.718 --> 47:06.051
Tyrion.

47:08.885 --> 47:11.468
What if there's someone else?

47:11.551 --> 47:13.176
Someone better?

47:21.509 --> 47:23.551
You're not gonna
ride the dragon south?

47:27.259 --> 47:28.426
Just a horse.

47:29.760 --> 47:30.926
Rhaegal needs to heal.

47:31.009 --> 47:32.718
He doesn't need me
weighing him down.

47:32.801 --> 47:36.134
You weigh as much
as two fleas fucking.

47:37.426 --> 47:39.092
I'm taking the Free Folk home.

47:40.092 --> 47:42.843
We've had enough of the south.

47:42.926 --> 47:44.967
The women down here
don't like me.

47:47.051 --> 47:49.217
This is the North, you know.

47:50.468 --> 47:52.885
And the Free Folk
are welcome to stay.

47:54.426 --> 47:56.092
It isn't home.

47:56.176 --> 47:57.635
We need room to wander.

47:57.718 --> 47:59.801
I'll take them
back through Castle Black

47:59.885 --> 48:02.343
as soon as
the winter storms pass.

48:02.426 --> 48:04.092
Back where we belong.

48:08.051 --> 48:10.384
It's where he belongs too.

48:10.468 --> 48:13.176
A direwolf has no place
in the south.

48:14.426 --> 48:16.801
Will you take him with you?

48:18.051 --> 48:20.009
He'll be happier up there.

48:21.051 --> 48:22.343
So would you.

48:24.343 --> 48:26.760
I wish I was going with you.

48:31.134 --> 48:32.426
This is farewell, then.

48:34.009 --> 48:35.676
You never know.

48:41.885 --> 48:44.134
You've got the North in you.

48:45.635 --> 48:47.092
The real North.

49:19.593 --> 49:22.760
Yes, well, the nights
have been getting longer

49:22.843 --> 49:25.426
and there wasn't that much
to do in Oldtown.

49:25.509 --> 49:28.134
There's only so many books
a person can read, so we...

49:28.217 --> 49:30.926
I'm sure he knows
how it happens, Sam.

49:34.217 --> 49:36.885
If it's a boy,
we want to name him Jon.

49:40.217 --> 49:41.718
I hope it's a girl.

50:00.551 --> 50:02.676
You're the best friend
I ever had.

50:05.134 --> 50:07.176
You too, Sam.

51:07.718 --> 51:10.009
Think of the past 20 years.

51:11.009 --> 51:13.926
The war, the murder, the misery.

51:14.009 --> 51:16.426
All of it because
Robert Baratheon loved someone

51:16.509 --> 51:18.426
who didn't love him back.

51:20.509 --> 51:21.676
How many others know?

51:23.468 --> 51:26.092
Including us? Eight.

51:26.176 --> 51:28.259
Well, then
it's not a secret anymore.

51:28.343 --> 51:30.134
It's information.

51:30.217 --> 51:33.551
If a handful of people know now,
hundreds will know soon.

51:33.635 --> 51:35.051
Then what happens?

51:35.134 --> 51:36.718
She loses the North.

51:36.801 --> 51:39.593
She loses the Vale,
Sansa will make sure of that.

51:39.676 --> 51:41.092
No, it's worse than that.

51:41.176 --> 51:43.926
He has the better claim
to the throne.

51:44.009 --> 51:46.217
He doesn't want the throne.

51:46.301 --> 51:48.718
I'm not sure it matters
what he wants.

51:49.926 --> 51:53.176
The fact is,
people are drawn to him.

51:53.259 --> 51:54.967
Wildlings, Northmen.

51:56.967 --> 51:58.217
He's a war hero.

52:02.676 --> 52:04.843
He loves our queen.

52:06.384 --> 52:07.676
And she loves him.

52:09.885 --> 52:12.301
If we marry them,
they could rule together.

52:13.343 --> 52:14.509
She's his aunt.

52:14.593 --> 52:15.985
That never stopped
a Targaryen before.

52:16.009 --> 52:17.718
No, but Jon grew up
in Winterfell.

52:17.801 --> 52:20.051
Is marrying your aunt
common in the North?

52:22.801 --> 52:24.468
You know our queen
better than I do.

52:24.551 --> 52:27.259
Do you think
she wants to share the throne?

52:27.343 --> 52:29.885
She does not like to have
her authority questioned.

52:29.967 --> 52:31.217
Something she has in common

52:31.301 --> 52:33.885
with every monarch
who ever lived.

52:33.967 --> 52:35.760
I worry about her state of mind.

52:35.843 --> 52:37.967
We are advisors to the queen.

52:38.051 --> 52:41.384
Worrying about her state of mind
is our job.

52:49.343 --> 52:51.384
We still have to take
King's Landing.

52:52.551 --> 52:55.134
Maybe Cersei will win
and kill us all.

52:55.217 --> 52:57.509
That would solve our problems.

55:01.051 --> 55:03.509
Get to the skiff. Now!

55:05.593 --> 55:07.051
Spears!

55:07.134 --> 55:09.092
They're coming round again!

55:17.718 --> 55:19.176
Go!

55:19.259 --> 55:20.468
Clear!

55:20.551 --> 55:22.426
Man your stations!

55:22.509 --> 55:24.176
No!

55:42.092 --> 55:44.676
- Go! Go!
- Clear!

56:20.384 --> 56:21.468
Missandei?

56:23.051 --> 56:24.301
Missandei!

56:30.384 --> 56:31.801
Missandei!

56:36.718 --> 56:38.718
Our message was well-received, then?

56:38.801 --> 56:42.092
Your people have
heard the Usurper is coming.

56:42.176 --> 56:44.676
They are grateful
for your protection

56:44.760 --> 56:47.134
within the walls
of the Red Keep.

56:49.384 --> 56:51.343
You're certain about the dragon?

56:51.426 --> 56:53.676
I saw it sink beneath the waves.

56:53.760 --> 56:56.009
That must have been glorious.

56:58.217 --> 57:00.343
The glory is yours, my queen.

57:01.843 --> 57:04.343
When the war is won,
the Lion shall rule the land,

57:04.426 --> 57:06.092
the Kraken shall rule the sea...

57:07.468 --> 57:10.676
and our child
shall one day rule them all.

57:27.509 --> 57:29.217
She's coming for you.

57:30.343 --> 57:31.551
Of course she is.

57:34.343 --> 57:36.051
Keep the gates open.

57:36.134 --> 57:38.760
If she wants to take the castle,
she'll have to murder

57:38.843 --> 57:41.343
thousands
of innocent people first.

57:47.426 --> 57:49.926
So much for
"the Breaker of Chains."

58:03.468 --> 58:05.926
We will storm the city, my queen.

58:06.009 --> 58:09.217
We will kill your enemies.
All of them.

58:09.301 --> 58:10.384
Your Grace.

58:11.967 --> 58:15.635
I promised you I would look you
in the eye and speak directly

58:15.718 --> 58:18.051
if I ever thought
you were making a mistake.

58:21.593 --> 58:24.343
This is a mistake.

58:26.885 --> 58:29.426
You saw my child
fall from the sky.

58:31.051 --> 58:33.051
They took Missandei.

58:33.134 --> 58:35.134
Cersei needs to be destroyed,

58:35.217 --> 58:39.426
but if we attack King's Landing
with Drogon and the Unsullied

58:39.509 --> 58:40.718
and the Dothraki,

58:40.801 --> 58:42.967
tens of thousands
of innocents will die.

58:43.051 --> 58:47.760
That is why Cersei is bringing
them into the Red Keep.

58:47.843 --> 58:51.509
These are the people
you came here to protect.

58:51.593 --> 58:53.217
I beg you, Your Grace.

58:53.301 --> 58:57.009
Do not destroy the city
you came to save.

58:57.092 --> 59:00.926
Do not become what you
have always struggled to defeat.

59:05.760 --> 59:08.801
Do you believe we're here
for a reason, Lord Varys?

59:12.259 --> 59:15.343
I'm here to free the world
from tyrants.

59:16.509 --> 59:17.967
That is my destiny...

59:19.301 --> 59:22.259
and I will serve it,
no matter the cost.

59:29.217 --> 59:32.051
It could be a fortnight before
Jon and the allied armies

59:32.134 --> 59:34.134
make it to King's Landing.

59:34.217 --> 59:37.051
In the meantime,
demand Cersei surrender.

59:37.134 --> 59:40.468
Offer her her life
in exchange for the throne.

59:42.009 --> 59:44.509
If there's a chance
to avoid the coming slaughter,

59:44.593 --> 59:47.009
we should make the effort.

59:47.092 --> 59:49.967
Speaking to Cersei
will not prevent a slaughter.

59:52.217 --> 59:53.801
But perhaps it's good
the people see

59:53.885 --> 59:57.885
that Daenerys Stormborn made
every effort to avoid bloodshed,

59:57.967 --> 01:00:00.301
and Cersei Lannister refused.

01:00:02.009 --> 01:00:03.426
They should know whom to blame

01:00:03.509 --> 01:00:05.635
when the sky
falls down upon them.

01:00:19.801 --> 01:00:22.384
I've served tyrants
most of my life.

01:00:23.384 --> 01:00:26.593
They all talk about destiny.

01:00:26.676 --> 01:00:29.926
She's a girl who walked
into a fire with three stones

01:00:30.009 --> 01:00:32.676
and walked out
with three dragons.

01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:35.509
How could she not
believe in destiny?

01:00:35.593 --> 01:00:37.468
Perhaps that's the problem.

01:00:37.551 --> 01:00:38.760
Her life has convinced her

01:00:38.843 --> 01:00:40.718
that she was sent here
to save us all.

01:00:40.801 --> 01:00:42.718
And how do you know she wasn't?

01:00:44.967 --> 01:00:46.885
Then there's the problem
of Jon Snow.

01:00:53.384 --> 01:00:56.176
Perhaps
it's actually a solution.

01:00:57.718 --> 01:00:59.134
You know them both.

01:00:59.217 --> 01:01:02.343
Tell me, who do you think
would make a better ruler?

01:01:07.635 --> 01:01:09.384
He doesn't want the throne.

01:01:09.468 --> 01:01:11.926
That's why he bent the knee.

01:01:12.009 --> 01:01:14.092
Have you considered
the best ruler

01:01:14.176 --> 01:01:16.593
might be someone
who doesn't want to rule?

01:01:16.676 --> 01:01:18.967
We're discussing treason.

01:01:19.051 --> 01:01:21.718
Don't pretend
you haven't thought about it.

01:01:21.801 --> 01:01:25.134
Of course I've thought about it.
Thoughts aren't treason.

01:01:27.217 --> 01:01:31.259
He's temperate and measured.
He's a man,

01:01:31.343 --> 01:01:34.092
which makes him more appealing
to the lords of Westeros,

01:01:34.176 --> 01:01:36.426
whose support
we are going to need.

01:01:36.509 --> 01:01:37.926
Joffrey was a man.

01:01:38.009 --> 01:01:40.259
I don't think a cock
is a true qualification,

01:01:40.343 --> 01:01:41.468
as I'm sure you'd agree.

01:01:41.551 --> 01:01:43.509
And he's the heir to the throne.

01:01:43.593 --> 01:01:47.593
Yes, because he's a man.
Cocks are important, I'm afraid.

01:01:50.468 --> 01:01:53.509
What about my earlier proposal?

01:01:53.593 --> 01:01:55.801
They could rule together
as king and queen.

01:01:57.426 --> 01:01:59.760
She's too strong for him.

01:01:59.843 --> 01:02:03.384
She'd bend him to her will,
as she already has.

01:02:03.468 --> 01:02:06.551
He could temper
her worst impulses.

01:02:06.635 --> 01:02:08.593
As you have?

01:02:11.676 --> 01:02:13.843
You're drinking quite a lot.

01:02:16.259 --> 01:02:19.885
A Targaryen father
and a Stark mother.

01:02:19.967 --> 01:02:22.885
Jon's the one man alive
who might actually be able

01:02:22.967 --> 01:02:24.843
to keep the North
in the Seven Kingdoms.

01:02:24.926 --> 01:02:26.566
How many kings and queens
have you served?

01:02:26.593 --> 01:02:27.967
Five? Six? I've lost count.

01:02:28.051 --> 01:02:29.902
- You've always known my reasons.
- At a certain point,

01:02:29.926 --> 01:02:31.551
you choose a person
you believe in,

01:02:31.635 --> 01:02:33.134
and you fight for that person.

01:02:33.217 --> 01:02:35.301
Even if you know it's a mistake?

01:02:37.134 --> 01:02:38.843
I believe in our queen.

01:02:41.384 --> 01:02:43.593
She'll make the right choice.

01:02:45.176 --> 01:02:48.051
With the help
of her loyal advisors.

01:02:51.801 --> 01:02:54.176
You know
where my loyalty stands.

01:02:54.259 --> 01:02:56.551
You know I will never
betray the realm.

01:02:56.635 --> 01:02:57.926
What is the realm?

01:02:58.009 --> 01:03:00.134
A vast continent,
home to millions of people,

01:03:00.217 --> 01:03:02.235
most of whom don't care
who sits on the Iron Throne.

01:03:02.259 --> 01:03:04.217
Millions of people,
many of whom will die

01:03:04.301 --> 01:03:06.967
if the wrong person
sits on that throne.

01:03:07.051 --> 01:03:08.259
We don't know their names,

01:03:08.343 --> 01:03:10.217
but they're just as real
as you and I.

01:03:10.301 --> 01:03:11.509
They deserve to live.

01:03:11.593 --> 01:03:13.509
They deserve
food for their children.

01:03:17.259 --> 01:03:21.551
I will act in their interest,
no matter the personal cost.

01:03:23.676 --> 01:03:26.343
So, what happens to her?

01:03:34.301 --> 01:03:35.509
Please.

01:03:37.801 --> 01:03:38.885
Don't.

01:03:43.551 --> 01:03:46.051
I've spoken
as honestly as I can.

01:03:47.551 --> 01:03:50.259
Each of us has a choice to make.

01:03:51.301 --> 01:03:54.259
I pray we choose wisely.

01:04:05.176 --> 01:04:07.009
I'm just about to start it.

01:04:07.092 --> 01:04:08.509
Good luck.

01:04:08.593 --> 01:04:10.509
Protect shell right up to the wall.

01:04:10.593 --> 01:04:12.235
All right,
I'll put another one on it.

01:04:12.259 --> 01:04:14.092
He's headed down to the cellar.

01:04:14.176 --> 01:04:16.217
I'll need a cart over here.

01:04:16.301 --> 01:04:17.509
That's it, thanks.

01:04:17.593 --> 01:04:19.176
Thank you.

01:04:19.259 --> 01:04:20.652
It's really heavy, mind you.

01:04:20.676 --> 01:04:21.926
We need some more water.

01:04:22.009 --> 01:04:23.593
Take it down there!

01:04:28.509 --> 01:04:30.926
...as are the rest
of her advisors.

01:04:33.259 --> 01:04:34.301
What happened?

01:04:39.926 --> 01:04:44.301
Euron Greyjoy ambushed
Queen Daenerys and her fleet.

01:04:44.384 --> 01:04:47.343
One of the dragons was killed,
several ships destroyed,

01:04:47.426 --> 01:04:49.593
Missandei captured.

01:04:51.468 --> 01:04:55.635
I always wanted to be there
when they execute your sister.

01:04:55.718 --> 01:04:58.426
Seems like
I won't get the chance.

01:06:05.176 --> 01:06:07.801
They're going to destroy
that city.

01:06:08.843 --> 01:06:10.343
You know they will.

01:06:10.426 --> 01:06:12.718
Have you ever run away from a fight?

01:06:14.676 --> 01:06:17.092
You're not like your sister.
You're not.

01:06:17.176 --> 01:06:19.301
You're better than she is.

01:06:19.384 --> 01:06:21.926
You're a good man
and you can't save her.

01:06:22.009 --> 01:06:23.926
You don't need to die with her.

01:06:24.009 --> 01:06:25.551
Stay here.

01:06:27.426 --> 01:06:28.760
Stay with me.

01:06:30.468 --> 01:06:32.426
Please.

01:06:33.509 --> 01:06:34.509
Stay.

01:06:41.176 --> 01:06:43.009
You think I'm a good man?

01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:50.468
I pushed a boy
out a tower window,

01:06:50.551 --> 01:06:52.635
crippled him for life

01:06:52.718 --> 01:06:53.718
for Cersei.

01:06:56.801 --> 01:06:59.760
I strangled my cousin
with my own hands

01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:02.885
just to get back to Cersei.

01:07:05.885 --> 01:07:07.217
I would have murdered

01:07:07.301 --> 01:07:11.509
every man, woman and child
in Riverrun

01:07:11.593 --> 01:07:12.718
for Cersei.

01:07:21.593 --> 01:07:23.426
She's hateful.

01:07:25.301 --> 01:07:26.551
And so am I.

01:10:01.635 --> 01:10:02.635
My lord.

01:10:05.926 --> 01:10:08.967
Queen Daenerys demands Cersei's
unconditional surrender

01:10:09.051 --> 01:10:11.760
and the immediate release
of Missandei of Naath.

01:10:13.426 --> 01:10:17.843
Queen Cersei demands Daenerys's
unconditional surrender.

01:10:17.926 --> 01:10:21.967
If she refuses, Missandei
of Naath will die here and now.

01:10:23.635 --> 01:10:24.635
Qyburn...

01:10:26.092 --> 01:10:27.885
you're a rational man.

01:10:27.967 --> 01:10:30.926
Or so I flatter myself,
my lord.

01:10:31.009 --> 01:10:32.468
We have a chance here,

01:10:33.718 --> 01:10:37.217
perhaps our last chance,
to avoid carnage.

01:10:37.301 --> 01:10:38.301
Yes.

01:10:40.051 --> 01:10:41.051
Help me.

01:10:42.217 --> 01:10:45.092
I don't want to see
this city burn.

01:10:45.176 --> 01:10:48.468
I don't want to hear the screams
of children burning alive.

01:10:50.468 --> 01:10:53.426
No, it is not a pleasant sound.

01:10:55.635 --> 01:10:57.801
I... I don't want to hear it.

01:10:58.801 --> 01:11:00.301
Help me save this city.

01:11:02.259 --> 01:11:04.926
My lord, I am only a mouthpiece
for our queen.

01:11:05.009 --> 01:11:06.718
Your queen.

01:11:06.801 --> 01:11:08.926
Cersei is
Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

01:11:09.009 --> 01:11:10.134
You are her subject.

01:11:10.217 --> 01:11:12.259
Her reign is over.

01:11:12.343 --> 01:11:14.885
You understand this.
Help her understand it.

01:11:14.967 --> 01:11:17.509
We understand
nothing of the sort.

01:11:18.843 --> 01:11:21.384
Your queen's last dragon
is vulnerable.

01:11:21.468 --> 01:11:24.384
Your armies
are battle-weary and depleted,

01:11:24.468 --> 01:11:27.760
while ours have been reinforced
with the Golden Compan...

01:11:45.635 --> 01:11:47.801
Ready!

01:11:47.885 --> 01:11:48.926
Nock!

01:11:51.801 --> 01:11:53.009
Draw!

01:12:59.301 --> 01:13:02.134
I know you don't care
about your people.

01:13:04.092 --> 01:13:05.885
Why should you?

01:13:07.384 --> 01:13:10.967
They hate you and you hate them.

01:13:16.468 --> 01:13:18.926
But you're not a monster.

01:13:20.967 --> 01:13:22.176
I know this.

01:13:24.301 --> 01:13:27.134
I know this
because I've seen it.

01:13:31.009 --> 01:13:33.468
You've always
loved your children.

01:13:35.468 --> 01:13:36.967
More than yourself,

01:13:37.967 --> 01:13:39.426
more than Jaime...

01:13:42.217 --> 01:13:43.676
more than anything.

01:13:46.635 --> 01:13:48.301
I beg you.

01:13:50.509 --> 01:13:53.967
If not for yourself,
then for your child.

01:13:57.509 --> 01:14:00.051
Your reign is over,

01:14:00.134 --> 01:14:03.134
but that doesn't mean
your life has to end.

01:14:06.009 --> 01:14:08.885
It doesn't mean
your baby has to die.

01:14:56.718 --> 01:15:00.384
If you have any last words,
now is the time.

01:15:25.134 --> 01:15:26.426
Dracarys.

01:15:35.635 --> 01:15:37.259
No.
