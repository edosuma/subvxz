WEBVTT

00:10.178 --> 00:13.481
( pages turning )

00:24.325 --> 00:28.028
- YOU'RE NOT GOING IN WITH ME.
- DAD, RELAX.

00:28.129 --> 00:30.898
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHY YOU CAME UP.

00:30.998 --> 00:32.400
( door opens )

00:32.500 --> 00:35.236
- HELLO, PAUL.
- HELLO, WALTER.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

00:35.336 --> 00:37.405
UH, YOU REMEMBER
MY DAUGHTER NATALIE?

00:37.505 --> 00:39.240
OF COURSE.
HOW ARE YOU, NATALIE?

00:39.340 --> 00:42.376
- HE'S DOING MUCH BETTER.
- ( laughs ) THANK YOU, NATALIE.

00:42.476 --> 00:45.646
THEY WOULDN'T LET ME
OUT OF THE LOONY BIN
WITHOUT AN ESCORT.

00:49.250 --> 00:52.086
( theme music playing )

01:18.379 --> 01:20.481
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D BE
HAPPY TO BE BACK HERE.

01:20.581 --> 01:23.384
BUT IT FEELS GOOD
TO GET OUT OF
THAT PLACE,

01:23.484 --> 01:25.253
EVEN IF IT'S ONLY
FOR AN HOUR.

01:25.353 --> 01:27.921
SO YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
OUT AT ALL THIS WEEK?

01:28.021 --> 01:29.757
UH, YEAH,
A COUPLE OF TIMES.

01:31.525 --> 01:33.927
CONNIE AND...

01:34.027 --> 01:36.297
NATALIE TOOK ME
TO LUNCH.

01:38.299 --> 01:40.234
AND HOW WAS THAT?

01:40.334 --> 01:42.903
IT WAS A CUTE LITTLE
IRISH PLACE, ACTUALLY,

01:43.003 --> 01:45.573
RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET.
YOU PROBABLY WOULD HAVE
LIKED IT.

01:45.673 --> 01:48.876
I HAD STEW,

01:48.976 --> 01:51.412
SODA BREAD.
CONNIE CRIED.

01:51.512 --> 01:55.015
I SAT THERE
WONDERING IF EVERYONE
IN THE RESTAURANT

01:55.115 --> 01:59.420
MADE ME FOR A GUY
BEING ON LUNCH-LEAVE
FROM THE RUBBER ROOM.

01:59.520 --> 02:02.490
I DOUBT THEY WERE
THINKING THAT, WALTER.

02:02.590 --> 02:07.228
IT'S HUMILIATING.
MY OWN DAUGHTER HAS
TO SIGN ME OUT,

02:07.328 --> 02:10.063
SIT IN YOUR WAITING ROOM,
SIGN ME BACK IN

02:10.164 --> 02:12.500
LIKE I'M A DANGER
TO SOCIETY.

02:12.600 --> 02:16.136
I THINK THE FEAR IS THAT YOU
MIGHT BE A DANGER TO YOURSELF.

02:17.705 --> 02:21.442
- CAN I ASK YOU
SOMETHING, PAUL?
- SURE.

02:21.542 --> 02:25.413
YOU SAID THAT THIS WAS ONE OF
THE BEST FACILITIES IN THE CITY?

02:25.513 --> 02:29.082
MM-HMM.
IT IS VERY HIGHLY REGARDED.

02:29.183 --> 02:30.918
THEN WHAT ARE
THE REST OF THEM LIKE?

02:31.018 --> 02:35.323
I'M NOT COMPLAINING.
YOU'VE BEEN THERE YOURSELF
A FEW TIMES NOW.

02:35.423 --> 02:38.158
IT'S CLEAN, WELL LIT.

02:38.259 --> 02:40.060
WALTER, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST TELL ME

02:40.160 --> 02:42.563
WHAT IT IS THAT BOTHERS YOU
ABOUT THE PLACE?

02:42.663 --> 02:43.997
OKAY.

02:44.097 --> 02:46.234
IT'S THE STAFF:

02:46.334 --> 02:48.969
THE THERAPISTS,
SOCIAL WORKERS.

02:49.069 --> 02:51.472
MAYBE I'VE BEEN
SPOILED BY YOU,

02:51.572 --> 02:54.174
BUT THESE PEOPLE,
THEY JUST...

02:54.275 --> 02:55.976
THEY'RE JUST
NOT VERY BRIGHT.

02:56.076 --> 02:59.347
- HOW DO YOU MEAN?
- WELL, YOU'RE EITHER BRIGHT
OR YOU'RE NOT.

02:59.447 --> 03:01.949
YOU CAN'T FAKE IT.

03:02.049 --> 03:05.619
WHEN I TALK TO YOU I DON'T
HAVE TO EXPLAIN MYSELF.

03:05.719 --> 03:09.056
YOU LISTEN, YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M SAYING,

03:09.156 --> 03:11.392
YOU RESPOND RIGHT AWAY.

03:11.492 --> 03:14.462
IF I MENTION A NAME
EVEN ONCE,

03:14.562 --> 03:16.997
YOU REMEMBER IT
THE NEXT TIME.

03:17.097 --> 03:19.500
THESE PEOPLE...

03:19.600 --> 03:22.370
THEY'RE JUST NOT UP TO SPEED.

03:22.470 --> 03:24.905
I HAVE TO BACKTRACK
ALL THE TIME.

03:25.005 --> 03:28.676
WELL, I THINK THAT YOU AND I
HAVE A RELATIONSHIP, WALTER.

03:28.776 --> 03:32.546
AND I CAN IMAGINE HOW
FRUSTRATING IT MUST BE

03:32.646 --> 03:35.283
TO COVER THE SAME GROUND
THAT WE HAVE IN OUR SESSIONS.

03:35.383 --> 03:37.951
YEAH, BUT IT'S
NOT ONLY THAT.

03:38.051 --> 03:42.556
THEY TALK TO ME LIKE
I'M A FOUR-YEAR-OLD--
OR MAYBE AN 80-YEAR-OLD

03:42.656 --> 03:45.826
WHO HAS TO HAVE EVERYTHING
EXPLAINED TO HIM

03:45.926 --> 03:48.362
LOUDLY AND SLOWLY.

03:48.462 --> 03:52.065
- SO YOU FEEL PATRONIZED.
- YEAH, EXACTLY. SEE,
THAT'S IT.

03:52.165 --> 03:54.735
THAT'S WHAT I MEAN--
YOU UNDERSTAND ME.

03:54.835 --> 03:57.638
WELL, TO BE HONEST, WALTER,
THAT WASN'T A DIFFICULT ONE.

03:57.738 --> 04:01.074
YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER FELT
PATRONIZED BY YOU.

04:01.174 --> 04:04.244
YOU RESPECTED ME,
I RESPECTED YOU.

04:04.345 --> 04:06.079
WE'RE EQUALS.

04:06.179 --> 04:09.883
YOU KNOW, I HAVEN'T
REALLY GOTTEN THAT SENSE
FROM YOU BEFORE, TO BE HONEST.

04:09.983 --> 04:12.353
- YOU HAVEN'T?
- ACTUALLY I'VE ALWAYS FELT

04:12.453 --> 04:13.987
THAT I'VE KIND
OF ANNOYED YOU,

04:14.087 --> 04:16.924
THAT OUR TALKING TOGETHER
WAS A WASTE OF YOUR TIME.

04:17.024 --> 04:21.161
FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN I DRAW
CONNECTIONS BETWEEN YOUR PAST
AND YOUR PRESENT,

04:21.261 --> 04:24.197
UH, YOU'VE BELITTLED THEM.

04:24.298 --> 04:26.233
AND ME.

04:26.334 --> 04:28.769
WELL, IF YOU FELT
THAT WAY, I'M SORRY.

04:28.869 --> 04:32.573
THE TRUTH IS THAT RIGHT
FROM THAT FIRST BLINK TEST

04:32.673 --> 04:34.608
I COULD SEE
YOU WERE TOP NOTCH.

04:34.708 --> 04:36.744
AND YET,
I THINK I REMEMBER THAT

04:36.844 --> 04:40.381
YOU QUESTIONED
MY ACADEMIC CREDENTIALS.

04:40.481 --> 04:42.950
AND DIDN'T YOU RUN
A BACKGROUND CHECK ON ME?

04:43.050 --> 04:46.787
THERE'S THAT MEMORY OF YOURS--
IT WON'T LET GO OF ANY DETAILS.

04:46.887 --> 04:50.157
YOU CAN SEE WHY I MIGHT BE
A LITTLE SURPRISED TO HEAR

04:50.257 --> 04:52.360
THAT YOU'RE NOW SINGING
MY PRAISES.

04:52.460 --> 04:55.563
BOY, YOU HAVE A HARD TIME TAKING
A COMPLIMENT, DON'T YOU?

04:57.431 --> 04:59.800
MAYBE YOU SHOULD TALK
TO SOMEBODY ABOUT THAT.

04:59.900 --> 05:03.337
OKAY, SINCE

05:03.437 --> 05:06.273
YOU HAVE SO MUCH
RESPECT FOR MY

05:06.374 --> 05:08.709
UNDERSTANDING OF YOU--
( clears throat )

05:08.809 --> 05:11.945
- CAN I BE BLUNT?
- ABSOLUTELY.

05:12.045 --> 05:16.049
- WHY ARE YOU SUCKING UP TO ME?
- EXCUSE ME?

05:16.149 --> 05:17.351
I THINK
YOU'RE RIGHT, WALTER.

05:17.451 --> 05:19.787
I HAVE TRIED
TO EMPATHIZE WITH YOU

05:19.887 --> 05:22.690
AND I KNOW THAT I'VE MADE
SOME MISTAKES,

05:22.790 --> 05:26.494
BUT I THINK I HAVE
A PRETTY FAIR IDEA
OF YOUR OPINION OF ME.

05:26.594 --> 05:29.397
SO I'LL ASK YOU AGAIN:

05:29.497 --> 05:32.733
WHY ARE YOU
SUCKING UP TO ME?

05:38.171 --> 05:40.508
LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

05:43.977 --> 05:45.278
WHAT-- WHAT IS IT?

05:45.379 --> 05:48.582
IT'S A POTHOLDER.
I MADE IT MYSELF--

05:48.682 --> 05:51.452
IN OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY.

05:51.552 --> 05:55.088
TOMORROW WE'RE GONNA
GLUE LITTLE BITS
OF TILE TOGETHER

05:55.188 --> 05:57.791
AND MAKE COASTERS.

05:57.891 --> 06:01.495
I DON'T IMAGINE
YOU'RE THE BEST CANDIDATE
FOR OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY.

06:03.330 --> 06:04.998
WELL, I'M USED
TO BEING THE GLUE, PAUL,

06:05.098 --> 06:07.067
NOT PLAYING WITH IT.

06:07.167 --> 06:08.869
I'M SURE THAT'S NOT ALL

06:08.969 --> 06:10.904
YOU'RE DOING IN THERE.

06:11.004 --> 06:13.140
OH NO NO, OF COURSE NOT.

06:13.240 --> 06:15.208
THEN THERE'S GROUP THERAPY--

06:15.308 --> 06:17.044
WHICH ISN'T ONLY
A WASTE OF TIME,

06:17.144 --> 06:18.979
IT'S DISTURBING.

06:19.079 --> 06:22.550
I JUST SIT THERE AND I
LISTEN TO STRANGERS
TALKING ABOUT

06:22.650 --> 06:26.386
HOW THIS ONE WAS ABANDONED
OR THAT ONE WAS MOLESTED,

06:26.487 --> 06:29.089
AND HOW ANGRY THEY ARE
AT THEIR PARENTS.

06:29.189 --> 06:32.860
SO HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT
BEING ON THE SAME FLOOR
AS THESE PEOPLE?

06:32.960 --> 06:36.163
WELL, I GUESS I'M SUPPOSED
TO RELATE TO THEM

06:36.263 --> 06:38.566
OR SYMPATHIZE
OR YOU TELL ME.

06:38.666 --> 06:40.033
BUT COME ON, PAUL.

06:40.133 --> 06:44.171
TWO MONTHS AGO I WAS
A FULLY-ENGAGED C.E.O.,

06:44.271 --> 06:46.874
SOLVING
REAL-WORLD PROBLEMS.

06:46.974 --> 06:51.612
AND NOW I'M SITTING BETWEEN ONE
PERSON WHO LIKES TO WEAR DIAPERS

06:51.712 --> 06:54.147
AND ANOTHER ONE WHO LIKES
TO CUT HERSELF WITH A RAZOR.

06:54.247 --> 06:57.485
THERE'S NO DENYING
THAT YOU HAVE IT ROUGH.
AND YOU MUST BE ANGRY AT ME

06:57.585 --> 06:59.553
FOR SAYING THAT YOU
NEEDED TO BE THERE.

06:59.653 --> 07:04.024
NO NO, YOU WERE JUST
DOING YOUR JOB.

07:04.124 --> 07:06.627
I CAN IMAGINE YOU ALSO MIGHT
BE ANGRY THAT I WASN'T

07:06.727 --> 07:10.130
ABLE TO SAVE YOU FROM
THE DEPRESSION YOU FELL INTO.

07:15.035 --> 07:18.839
OR FROM THE ATTEMPT THAT
YOU MADE ON YOUR OWN LIFE.

07:23.877 --> 07:27.080
YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE SHRINKS
THERE SAID SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

07:28.649 --> 07:30.684
HE SAID YOU WERE RECKLESS.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.953
SAID THAT
YOU'D OPENED UP

07:33.053 --> 07:37.057
PANDORA'S BOX AT
THE WORST POSSIBLE TIME.

07:40.961 --> 07:44.231
I'M SORRY--
SHOULD I NOT HAVE TOLD YOU THAT?

07:44.331 --> 07:46.133
NO NO.

07:46.233 --> 07:49.402
BUT I'M SURE THAT MUST HAVE BEEN
UNSETTLING FOR YOU TO HEAR.

07:49.503 --> 07:51.905
WHAT DO YOU THINK
HE MEANT BY THAT?

07:52.005 --> 07:56.710
WELL, I DIDN'T TRUST IT.
I DIDN'T TRUST HIM.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.946
I TOLD HIM THAT IF IT
HADN'T HAVE BEEN FOR YOU,

07:59.046 --> 08:01.582
THAT I'D GONE OFF
THE DEEP END A LOT SOONER.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.919
I ALSO TOLD HIM
THAT HIS STAFF WASN'T
IN YOUR LEAGUE.

08:06.019 --> 08:08.522
- YOU'RE DOING IT AGAIN, WALTER.
- WHAT?

08:08.622 --> 08:11.158
BULLSHITTING ME.

08:12.459 --> 08:14.995
NOW WHAT IS IT THAT YOU
WANT FROM ME?

08:18.431 --> 08:20.568
OUT.

08:20.668 --> 08:24.437
I WANT OUT.

08:24.538 --> 08:26.940
AND YOU'RE HOPING THAT
IF YOU FLATTER ME ENOUGH

08:27.040 --> 08:29.610
THAT I'LL SIGN OFF
ON YOUR RELEASE, IS THAT IT?

08:29.710 --> 08:32.212
I'M CLIMBING
THE WALLS, PAUL.

08:32.312 --> 08:35.983
AND IT'S ANOTHER WEEK
BEFORE I CAN GO
BEFORE A JUDGE.

08:36.083 --> 08:37.985
LOOK, I UNDERSTAND

08:38.085 --> 08:40.153
THAT A WEEK MAY SEEM
LIKE A VERY LONG TIME.

08:40.253 --> 08:41.855
( groans )

08:41.955 --> 08:45.693
GOD, ANOTHER DAY
IS AN ETERNITY.

08:47.294 --> 08:50.831
WHATEVER YOU NEED ME TO SAY
OR SIGN, I'LL DO IT.

08:50.931 --> 08:54.334
BUT PLEASE,
CALL DR. WELLS.

08:54.434 --> 08:56.336
HE'LL LISTEN TO YOU.

08:56.436 --> 09:00.073
BEFORE I DO THAT,
WE NEED TO TALK MORE.

09:00.173 --> 09:02.976
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?

09:03.777 --> 09:05.646
WHAT DO I WANT TO KNOW?

09:05.746 --> 09:08.616
ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU SAID TO ME
LAST WEEK IN THE HOSPITAL?

09:08.716 --> 09:12.119
AND THEN YOU PROCEEDED
TO TELL ME THAT YOU HAD
FOOD POISONING.

09:12.219 --> 09:16.924
DROP THE FACADE, WALTER.
IT'S A WASTE OF YOUR TIME
AND MINE.

09:17.024 --> 09:20.293
YOU'RE JUST SAYING WHAT YOU
THINK I WANT TO HEAR.

09:31.071 --> 09:33.273
I WAS ASHAMED.

09:35.008 --> 09:38.646
AND I DIDN'T WANT
NATALIE TO KNOW.

09:39.980 --> 09:42.983
OKAY.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.352
WHY DON'T YOU
TELL ME WHAT IT'S

09:45.452 --> 09:48.021
REALLY BEEN LIKE
THIS LAST WEEK.

09:50.991 --> 09:53.961
HELL.

09:55.295 --> 09:57.264
I HAVE
NOTHING TO DO.

09:58.465 --> 10:00.668
THERE'S ONE TV

10:00.768 --> 10:05.673
AND THE GROUP VOTES
ON WHAT CRAP THEY
WANT TO WATCH.

10:06.874 --> 10:09.943
THERE'S A PIANO THAT
NO ONE CAN PLAY.

10:11.511 --> 10:14.882
THEY GIVE US CHORES,
BUT IT'S MAKE-WORK.

10:14.982 --> 10:17.417
I'M NOT
DOING ANYTHING.

10:17.517 --> 10:20.620
- SO HOW DO
YOU PASS THE TIME?
- WALK THE HALLS.

10:20.721 --> 10:23.791
IT'S 9:00 A.M.

10:23.891 --> 10:28.428
I PACE,
STARE OUT THE WINDOW.

10:28.528 --> 10:32.399
HOURS GO BY.

10:32.499 --> 10:37.805
I THINK TO MYSELF,
"IT MUST BE GETTING
CLOSE TO LUNCHTIME."

10:39.172 --> 10:41.208
I LOOK AT THE CLOCK.

10:41.308 --> 10:43.443
IT'S 9:15.

10:43.543 --> 10:45.645
SO WHEN YOU STARE
OUT THE WINDOWS,

10:45.746 --> 10:48.281
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT?

10:48.381 --> 10:51.719
I THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH
I COULD'VE ALREADY GOTTEN DONE

10:51.819 --> 10:53.787
IF I STILL HAD MY JOB.

10:53.887 --> 10:55.856
YOU'RE USED TO BEING BUSY.

10:55.956 --> 10:59.226
I CAN IMAGINE IT'S...
IT'S A PRETTY DIFFICULT
ADJUSTMENT.

10:59.326 --> 11:00.928
I CAN'T ADJUST.

11:01.028 --> 11:04.531
I'M NOT COMFORTABLE
JUST WASTING TIME.

11:04.631 --> 11:07.935
THAT'S SOMETHING
THAT WE MIGHT WORK ON
WHILE YOU'RE THERE.

11:08.035 --> 11:11.404
( chuckles )
YOU WANT ME TO WORK
ON WASTING TIME?

11:11.504 --> 11:13.941
NO, WHAT I MEAN IS

11:14.041 --> 11:16.143
SOMETIMES WHEN PEOPLE
ARE HOSPITALIZED

11:16.243 --> 11:19.646
THE LACK OF DAY-TO-DAY
PRESSURE CAN CAUSE A RELIEF.

11:19.747 --> 11:22.382
IT FINALLY GIVES THEM
A CHANCE TO...

11:22.482 --> 11:25.152
TO CONTEMPLATE.

11:25.252 --> 11:27.220
I DON'T FOLLOW YOU.

11:27.320 --> 11:29.689
WELL, TO REFLECT.

11:29.790 --> 11:32.292
TO REFLECT ON WHAT'S
COME BEFORE,

11:32.392 --> 11:34.361
WHAT LIES AHEAD.

11:34.461 --> 11:37.064
I THINK YOU'VE BEEN
RUNNING SO HARD FOR SO LONG

11:37.164 --> 11:40.067
THAT YOU HAVEN'T HAD
THE CHANCE TO CHECK IN

11:40.167 --> 11:42.269
WITH YOURSELF.

11:46.239 --> 11:48.876
NATALIE SAID
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

11:48.976 --> 11:55.082
SHE SAID I SHOULD
"LISTEN TO MY INNER VOICE."

11:55.182 --> 11:58.418
I TOLD HER THE LAST THING
YOU WANT TO DO IF YOU'RE
IN A NUTHOUSE

11:58.518 --> 12:02.089
IS START HEARING VOICES.

12:02.189 --> 12:05.358
WHEN YOU WALK THE HALLS,
WHAT DO YOU FIND YOURSELF
THINKING ABOUT?

12:05.458 --> 12:08.161
I'M JUST ANXIOUS, PAUL.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.598
I THINK ABOUT MONEY.

12:11.698 --> 12:14.101
I THINK ABOUT
MY NET-WORTH NUMBERS.

12:14.201 --> 12:16.503
THEY'VE GONE DOWN
QUITE A BIT.

12:16.603 --> 12:18.105
BUT--

12:18.205 --> 12:21.909
I THINK ABOUT IS CONNIE
KEEPING UP WITH THE BILLS;

12:22.009 --> 12:25.846
IS THE CAR BATTERY
DEAD IN THE GARAGE;

12:28.581 --> 12:31.251
WHAT HAPPENED TO THOSE...

12:31.351 --> 12:33.954
THOSE POOR KIDS

12:34.054 --> 12:36.456
WHO DRANK THE FORMULA?

12:38.959 --> 12:41.094
I THINK ABOUT
THEIR FAMILIES...

12:42.262 --> 12:45.432
HOW THEY'RE
COPING WITH IT.

12:46.699 --> 12:49.202
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON--

12:54.174 --> 12:56.509
DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THEM OFTEN?

12:59.279 --> 13:01.548
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

13:08.021 --> 13:12.392
YOU SAID THAT YOU HAD SOME
SESSIONS WITH THE STAFF...

13:12.492 --> 13:15.428
"SHRINK."

13:15.528 --> 13:17.197
WHAT DID HE
TALK ABOUT?

13:17.297 --> 13:20.333
THEY WANT
TO REHASH THE CRISIS,

13:20.433 --> 13:24.737
THE FIRING.
I KEEP SAYING, "COULD YOU
JUST READ MY FILE?"

13:24.838 --> 13:27.374
AND AS YOU WERE
RETELLING THE STORY,

13:27.474 --> 13:30.810
CAN YOU REMEMBER
WHAT EMOTIONS CAME UP
FOR YOU?

13:30.911 --> 13:34.181
HAVE YOU EVER
GIVEN A DEPOSITION?

13:34.281 --> 13:37.150
YOU SAY
AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE
AND WAIT FOR IT TO END.

13:37.250 --> 13:40.320
YOU MENTIONED
THAT PANDORA'S BOX
HAD BEEN OPENED.

13:40.420 --> 13:44.691
SO YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT
SOME OF THOSE ISSUES?

13:44.791 --> 13:47.127
- LIKE WHAT?
- I DON'T KNOW,

13:47.227 --> 13:49.897
YOUR FAMILY HISTORY,
YOUR HISTORY WITH
THE DONALDSONS,

13:49.997 --> 13:53.133
YOUR ANXIETY ABOUT
SEPARATION.

13:53.233 --> 13:54.968
NOT REALLY.

13:55.068 --> 13:57.337
THEY DIDN'T ASK,
I DIDN'T TELL.

13:57.437 --> 14:00.540
DID THEY ASK YOU
ABOUT THE NIGHT YOU TRIED
TO KILL YOURSELF?

14:03.843 --> 14:06.513
WELL, OF COURSE
THEY ASKED ABOUT THAT.
THEY HAD TO, DIDN'T THEY?

14:06.613 --> 14:09.682
- YES, THEY DID.
- I'VE BEEN WHERE THEY ARE.

14:09.782 --> 14:11.218
WE'D ACQUIRE
A COMPANY.

14:11.318 --> 14:13.553
I'D GO OUT THERE
FOR THE VISIT.
( sighs )

14:13.653 --> 14:16.756
THE LOCAL MANAGER
WOULD WALK ME
THROUGH IT:

14:16.856 --> 14:21.261
HOW DEDICATED
EVERYONE WAS, HOW NOTHING
NEEDED TO CHANGE.

14:21.361 --> 14:25.966
AND THE WHOLE TIME
HE'S MAKING HIS PITCH,
I'M RUNNING NUMBERS.

14:26.066 --> 14:28.535
THEY WERE
EMOTIONALLY INVOLVED.

14:28.635 --> 14:30.270
I WAS THERE
TO EVALUATE.

14:30.370 --> 14:34.374
SO THESE DOCTORS,
YOU FEEL THEY'RE JUST
MAKING CLINICAL EVALUATIONS?

14:34.474 --> 14:36.910
THEY'RE JUST THINKING ABOUT
HOW MUCH TO MEDICATE ME,

14:37.010 --> 14:39.846
OR HOW MUCH
COVERAGE I HAVE.

14:39.947 --> 14:43.016
DO YOU THINK THEY MIGHT
BE ASSESSING ANYTHING ELSE?

14:46.987 --> 14:50.257
WHETHER I'LL TRY IT AGAIN.

14:52.759 --> 14:56.663
THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY'S
GOING TO WORRY ABOUT
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

14:56.763 --> 14:59.332
ISN'T IT?

15:08.041 --> 15:10.643
DO YOU WANT
TO TALK ABOUT THAT?

15:24.992 --> 15:28.361
PRETTY STREET
YOU LIVE ON.

15:30.397 --> 15:33.400
I NEVER NOTICED
THAT BEFORE.

15:35.102 --> 15:38.238
WELL, IT'S ALWAYS
BEEN DARK WHEN
YOU'VE ARRIVED.

15:38.338 --> 15:42.275
IT'S NICE TO SEE
THE SPRING COME.

15:47.180 --> 15:50.417
NOW I HAVE A CHANCE
TO PLANT MY GARDEN.

15:52.019 --> 15:55.388
SMELL THE ROSES.

16:00.660 --> 16:03.463
- CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?
- OF COURSE.

16:09.602 --> 16:12.739
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE
IF YOU WERE ME?

16:17.044 --> 16:19.979
I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT.

16:21.948 --> 16:24.251
I CAN REALLY UNDERSTAND...

16:26.019 --> 16:27.987
WHAT THAT PAIN WAS LIKE,

16:28.088 --> 16:30.290
HOW IT MUST HAVE
SEEMED UNBEARABLE...

16:31.758 --> 16:33.660
WITHOUT END.

16:33.760 --> 16:39.399
AND HOW, IN THAT MOMENT,
YOU THOUGHT YOU'D FOUND
A SOLUTION...

16:39.499 --> 16:42.302
A WAY OUT OF A HOPELESS
SITUATION.

16:44.471 --> 16:46.506
BUT, YOU KNOW,

16:46.606 --> 16:50.743
I THINK THAT THE WORST NIGHT
OF YOUR LIFE HAS PASSED, WALTER.

16:51.978 --> 16:54.314
YOU'VE SURVIVED IT.

16:54.414 --> 16:58.551
YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN
A SECOND CHANCE.

16:58.651 --> 17:02.155
AND THE VOID THAT YOU FELT--
MAYBE THE VOID THAT
YOU STILL FEEL

17:02.255 --> 17:06.025
CAN BE FILLED
AND THAT THERE'S
A POSSIBILITY OF RENEWAL.

17:07.527 --> 17:10.097
YOU KNOW,
I TRIED TO FIGHT IT.

17:12.632 --> 17:17.137
I KEPT TELLING MYSELF,
"SNAP OUT OF IT, WALTER.
SNAP OUT OF IT."

17:17.904 --> 17:20.039
I KEPT THINKING THAT

17:20.140 --> 17:25.112
I'D COME UP WITH SOME WAY
TO STOP FEELING.

17:25.212 --> 17:27.347
STOP FEELING WHAT?

17:28.615 --> 17:30.850
TO STOP FEELING.

17:30.950 --> 17:33.286
PERIOD.

17:34.654 --> 17:38.225
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN ABLE
TO WILL MYSELF OUT OF BED.

17:39.359 --> 17:42.729
EVEN IF I WAS DEAD TIRED
OR SICK,

17:42.829 --> 17:46.199
I WAS ALWAYS
ABLE TO WORK.

17:46.299 --> 17:50.069
- RING THE BELL, I ANSWERED.
- BUT NOT THIS TIME.

17:50.170 --> 17:53.173
IT'S LIKE...

17:53.273 --> 17:57.043
THERE'S THE WALTER BARNETT
THAT I KNEW,

17:57.144 --> 18:00.447
WHO COULD STAND UP
TO ANY PRESSURE.

18:00.547 --> 18:03.883
AND THEN THERE'S
THIS OTHER WALTER

18:03.983 --> 18:05.618
WHO I NEVER KNEW
EXISTED,

18:05.718 --> 18:08.488
WHO CRUMBLED,

18:08.588 --> 18:11.258
WHO COULDN'T
HANDLE THE PAIN.

18:13.793 --> 18:18.165
THESE TWO WALTERS,
ONE STRONG, THE OTHER WEAK--

18:20.367 --> 18:23.970
ARE THERE ANY OTHER
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THEM?

18:24.070 --> 18:27.039
I DON'T KNOW.

18:27.140 --> 18:30.210
LIKE I SAID,
I DON'T KNOW
THIS OTHER ONE.

18:30.310 --> 18:33.480
THE OTHER ONE YOU MEAN?
THE ONE WITHOUT A JOB?

18:35.548 --> 18:37.784
YOU SAID ANYTIME
THE BELL RANG,
YOU ANSWERED.

18:37.884 --> 18:41.354
MAYBE PART OF THE REASON
YOU COULDN'T SNAP OUT OF IT
THIS TIME WAS BECAUSE

18:41.454 --> 18:44.023
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN YOUR LIFE

18:44.123 --> 18:47.594
YOU WEREN'T ON CALL.
YOU WEREN'T ON DUTY.

18:47.694 --> 18:50.997
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- WELL, YOU PRIDE YOURSELF

18:51.097 --> 18:52.965
NOT JUST ON YOUR
ABILITY TO WORK,

18:53.065 --> 18:56.469
BUT ON YOUR ABILITY
TO WORK YOURSELF BEYOND
THE BRINK OF EXHAUSTION.

18:56.569 --> 18:59.071
THE FIRST DAY
THAT YOU CAME IN HERE,
YOU DIDN'T EVEN THINK

18:59.172 --> 19:01.474
THAT YOUR PANIC ATTACKS
WERE WORTH MENTIONING.

19:01.574 --> 19:04.244
IN THE TIME
THAT I'VE KNOWN YOU,
WALTER, I'VE NEVER HEARD

19:04.344 --> 19:06.479
YOU MENTION A HOBBY,
A DAY OFF, A NIGHT OUT.

19:06.579 --> 19:09.148
- YOU MET ME
IN THE MIDDLE OF A CRISIS.
- AND MY GUESS IS,

19:09.249 --> 19:13.220
BEFORE THIS CRISIS THERE
WAS ANOTHER CRISIS AND BEFORE
THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER ONE.

19:13.320 --> 19:16.055
AND IT STRETCHES RIGHT BACK
TO CHILDHOOD, TO VIETNAM,

19:16.155 --> 19:20.159
- TO THE DONALDSONS,
TO CONNIE'S REHAB.
- CONNIE'S REHAB?

19:20.260 --> 19:22.862
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I NEVER SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT THAT.

19:22.962 --> 19:25.865
NO, YOU DIDN'T,
BUT WHEN I SPOKE TO NATALIE
AT THE HOSPITAL--

19:25.965 --> 19:29.202
SHE HAD NO RIGHT TO EMBARRASS
CONNIE LIKE THAT!

19:29.302 --> 19:31.571
SHE WASN'T TRYING
TO EMBARRASS CONNIE, WALTER.

19:31.671 --> 19:34.374
- SHE ASSUMED
THAT YOU'D TOLD ME.
- WHY WOULD I HAVE DONE THAT?

19:34.474 --> 19:37.076
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE
DO IN THERAPY, WALTER.

19:37.176 --> 19:38.878
THEY TALK ABOUT
THEIR LIVES.

19:38.978 --> 19:43.182
- IF YOUR WIFE HAS A PROBLEM
WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE...
- SUBSTANCE ABUSE?!

19:43.283 --> 19:45.585
IT WAS
CHARDONNAYS, PAUL.

19:45.685 --> 19:48.955
AND A FEW PILLS.
SHE'S NOT A--

19:51.190 --> 19:53.826
CONNIE IS A GREAT WIFE.

19:53.926 --> 19:57.764
SHE MADE A FINE HOME.
SHE TOOK CARE
OF THE KIDS.

19:57.864 --> 20:00.533
SHE WATCHED THE HOME FRONT
LIKE A HAWK.

20:02.068 --> 20:04.504
THE PROBLEM STARTED--

20:05.872 --> 20:08.875
- IT'S MY FAULT.
- WHAT WAS YOUR FAULT, WALTER?

20:08.975 --> 20:12.345
I WAS AWAY SO MUCH.
I WAS ALWAYS TRAVELING.

20:12.445 --> 20:14.314
THE DOCTORS NEVER
UNDERSTOOD WHAT IT WAS.

20:14.414 --> 20:17.049
IT WAS MAYBE
A HYPOGLYCEMIA.

20:17.149 --> 20:19.419
OR LYME DISEASE,
SOMETHING CHEMICAL.

20:19.519 --> 20:22.989
SHE GETS IN A MOOD
AND SHE SLIDES DOWNHILL.

20:23.089 --> 20:24.524
AND YOU WERE ALWAYS
THERE TO CATCH HER.

20:24.624 --> 20:26.593
I'D BE HALFWAY
AROUND THE WORLD.

20:26.693 --> 20:29.329
I'D GET A CALL FROM THE BOYS
OR HER MOTHER.

20:29.429 --> 20:31.331
I'D BE
ON THE NEXT FLIGHT BACK.

20:31.431 --> 20:34.734
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN HER ROCK.

20:35.602 --> 20:37.504
UNTIL NOW.

20:39.572 --> 20:42.975
NOW I'VE LET HER DOWN.
I'VE LET EVERYONE DOWN.

20:46.813 --> 20:48.648
YOU'RE A HUMAN BEING.

20:48.748 --> 20:52.819
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO MALFUNCTION,
PAUL, THAT'S FOR OTHER PEOPLE.

20:52.919 --> 20:55.087
BUT NOT WALTER BARNETT.

20:55.187 --> 20:56.789
HE'S A SUPERMAN.

20:56.889 --> 20:58.891
ISN'T THAT WHAT YOUR WIFE
USED TO CALL YOU?

20:58.991 --> 21:01.294
THAT'S JUST A--
THAT'S JUST A FIGURE OF SPEECH.

21:01.394 --> 21:03.296
BUT IT'S
A PRETTY TELLING ONE.

21:03.396 --> 21:06.933
YOU'VE BEEN EVERYONE'S ROCK
YOUR ENTIRE LIFE.

21:07.033 --> 21:09.336
YOU MAKE IT SOUND LIKE
THAT'S SOMETHING BAD--

21:09.436 --> 21:13.506
- TO BE RESPONSIBLE.
- NO, I'M JUST WONDERING ABOUT
THE TOLL THAT IT'S TAKEN--

21:13.606 --> 21:17.176
THE PRESSURE
OR MAYBE EVEN THE NEED
TO ALWAYS BE THE HERO.

21:17.276 --> 21:19.646
NEED?
WHAT--

21:19.746 --> 21:22.248
- DO YOU THINK I LOOK FOR THIS?
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

21:22.349 --> 21:25.885
YOU THINK I'M SOME KIND OF
FIREMAN WHO GOES AROUND SETTING
FIRES SO I CAN PUT THEM OUT?

21:25.985 --> 21:29.288
- NO, WALTER,
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.
- THEN WHAT IS YOUR DAMN POINT?!

21:29.389 --> 21:34.727
COME ON, YOU KNOW
EVERYTHING. JUST TELL ME
WHAT YOU FUCKING THINK.

21:34.827 --> 21:37.063
I DON'T THINK YOU WANT
THE CRISIS, WALTER.

21:37.163 --> 21:40.500
BUT I DO WORRY
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO DO
WHEN YOU'RE NOT IN ONE.

21:40.600 --> 21:43.503
YOU'RE ANGRY AT YOURSELF

21:43.603 --> 21:45.672
FOR CRUMBLING
UNDER THIS PRESSURE.

21:45.772 --> 21:49.141
BUT I'M REALLY AMAZED THAT
YOU'VE HELD EVERYTHING TOGETHER
FOR AS LONG AS YOU DID.

21:49.241 --> 21:51.844
- THANKS A LOT.
- THE WALTER YOU KNOW

21:51.944 --> 21:54.714
HAS BEEN ON THE FRONT LINE
SINCE HIS BROTHER DIED--

21:54.814 --> 21:57.484
ON CALL, TAKING CARE
OF EVERYTHING,

21:57.584 --> 21:59.952
EVERYBODY,
SLEEPING WITH ONE EYE OPEN.

22:00.052 --> 22:03.089
BUT WITHOUT A MOUNTAIN
OF RESPONSIBILITY,

22:03.189 --> 22:05.558
THAT WALTER
IS COMPLETELY LOST.

22:05.658 --> 22:08.895
HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW
NOT TO BE IN CHARGE.

22:10.296 --> 22:12.465
HE'S FORGOTTEN HOW TO PLAY.

22:12.565 --> 22:15.234
HE CAN'T JUST SIT AND BE.

22:15.334 --> 22:19.271
MAYBE THAT'S WHY YOU'RE
CLIMBING THE WALLS
AT THE HOSPITAL.

22:19.372 --> 22:21.641
WELL, THEN
GET ME OUT OF THERE!

22:21.741 --> 22:23.843
AND IF I DID

22:23.943 --> 22:27.380
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
TO THE OTHER WALTER?

22:30.016 --> 22:31.618
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

22:31.718 --> 22:36.556
THE WALTER YOU SAID
YOU DIDN'T KNOW EXISTED,

22:36.656 --> 22:39.692
THE LITTLE BOY WHO HAD
HIS CHILDHOOD TAKEN AWAY
FROM HIM

22:39.792 --> 22:41.828
WHEN HE WAS SIX YEARS OLD.

22:41.928 --> 22:45.432
HE'S BEEN SITTING THERE
ALL THIS TIME

22:45.532 --> 22:48.868
IN THE DARK,
SCARED HALF TO DEATH,

22:48.968 --> 22:51.538
HOPING THAT SOMEBODY
WOULD NOTICE HIM,

22:51.638 --> 22:53.906
MAYBE COMFORT HIM.

22:54.006 --> 22:59.479
AND MAYBE...
MAYBE THIS IS HIS CHANCE.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.148
AND YOUR CHANCE

23:02.248 --> 23:05.418
TO FIND OUT
WHO THAT BOY IS...

23:07.219 --> 23:08.855
TO RECONNECT WITH
A PART OF YOURSELF

23:08.955 --> 23:12.058
YOU'VE HAD TO DENY
YOUR ENTIRE LIFE.

23:14.694 --> 23:18.465
AM I MAKING
ANY SENSE TO YOU?

23:18.565 --> 23:21.333
YOU WANT ME TO CONNECT
TO THAT PART OF MYSELF

23:21.434 --> 23:25.438
THAT FELL APART,
THAT CRUMBLED UNDER PRESSURE?

23:25.538 --> 23:28.240
WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

23:28.340 --> 23:31.978
BECAUSE, WALTER, I DON'T
THINK THAT'S THE PART
OF YOU THAT CRUMBLED.

23:35.181 --> 23:38.618
I THINK THAT'S THE PART
OF YOU THAT WANTS TO LIVE.

23:47.560 --> 23:49.796
( sobbing )
GOD...

23:54.000 --> 23:56.836
OH GOD, NO.

23:56.936 --> 24:00.172
I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY,
I'M SORRY.

24:29.969 --> 24:32.539
( wailing )

24:53.292 --> 24:56.529
( theme music playing )
