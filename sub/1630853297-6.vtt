WEBVTT

00:02.132 --> 00:03.481
Carmine, Lenny.

00:03.525 --> 00:04.743
Is there someplace to go?

00:04.787 --> 00:06.310
You don't feel safe
here in Harlem?

00:07.355 --> 00:09.139
- Carmine.- Fuck.

00:09.183 --> 00:11.098
Al, this is really scary.

00:11.141 --> 00:12.838
You did the right thing
by coming here.

00:12.882 --> 00:14.101
I appreciate that.

00:14.144 --> 00:15.406
Pacino can't do the film.

00:15.450 --> 00:17.191
He signed on
to another project.

00:17.234 --> 00:18.844
I need you
to get him out of it.

00:18.888 --> 00:22.413
You have got to be
fucking kidding me.

00:22.457 --> 00:24.676
De Niro does "The Gang
That Couldn't Shoot Straight,"

00:24.720 --> 00:26.069
Pacino does "The Godfather,"

00:26.113 --> 00:27.679
everybody wins.

00:27.723 --> 00:29.855
You got Pacino.
You got him!

00:29.899 --> 00:32.902
Al, there are two FBI agents
waiting for you.

00:32.945 --> 00:35.296
We need to take
Gallo out now.

00:35.339 --> 00:37.515
I gotta talk to Carlo
and the rest of the Commission

00:37.559 --> 00:39.865
to get the okay to rip
this motherfucker's face off.

00:39.909 --> 00:42.390
This is turning
into a fucking fiasco.

00:42.433 --> 00:44.696
We should be partners.No.

00:44.740 --> 00:46.872
I hear that Paramount's
getting spun off.

00:46.916 --> 00:48.613
Gulf and Western want out.

00:48.657 --> 00:50.093
We can get
a much better price

00:50.137 --> 00:53.140
if we offload Paramount now
and cash out.

00:53.183 --> 00:54.358
Come work for me.

00:54.402 --> 00:56.099
You're selling Paramount.

00:56.143 --> 00:57.405
Big day tomorrow.

00:57.448 --> 00:59.450
They said that this
was not going to succeed.

00:59.494 --> 01:00.756
You made it happen.

01:00.799 --> 01:02.279
After intense negotiations

01:02.323 --> 01:03.802
with Gulf and Western,

01:03.846 --> 01:05.456
the League has decided
to allow them

01:05.500 --> 01:07.154
to make the movie
"The Godfather."

01:07.197 --> 01:08.851
And it's all because
of this man right there,

01:08.894 --> 01:10.070
Al Ruddy.

02:35.807 --> 02:37.418
I'd also like to announce

02:37.461 --> 02:40.638
after intense negotiations
with Gulf and Western,

02:40.682 --> 02:42.205
the League has decided
to allow them

02:42.249 --> 02:43.598
to make the movie
"The Godfather."

02:44.990 --> 02:46.557
That's right.

02:46.601 --> 02:48.124
And--and I should say

02:48.168 --> 02:50.082
that it's all because
of this man right there,

02:50.126 --> 02:51.867
Al Ruddy.
Al, come up here.

02:51.910 --> 02:53.303
He's the film's producer.

02:53.347 --> 02:54.478
It's because of him
that we were able

02:54.522 --> 02:56.567
to come to this agreement.Fuck!

02:58.352 --> 03:00.441
This is the man
solely responsible

03:00.484 --> 03:02.443
for the alliance
between the Italian League,

03:02.486 --> 03:04.488
Gulf and Western,
and Paramount Pictures.

03:04.532 --> 03:06.186
Fuck.

03:06.229 --> 03:07.709
You're one of us.

03:07.752 --> 03:10.146
Hey, come on, come up here.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.756
How long have you
been working with Mr. Colombo?

03:11.800 --> 03:13.105
Take a picture.

03:13.149 --> 03:14.324
What are the details

03:14.368 --> 03:15.891
of this financial
relationship?

03:15.934 --> 03:17.240
How does Paramount Pictures

03:17.284 --> 03:18.198
feel about this, Mr. Ruddy?

03:18.241 --> 03:19.199
Fuck.

03:21.462 --> 03:23.246
How does
Gulf and Western feel about--

03:26.249 --> 03:28.773
Hey.What the hell, Al?

03:28.817 --> 03:29.861
I take it you're not here
to pick me up

03:29.905 --> 03:31.472
for our first day of shooting.

03:31.515 --> 03:33.387
I would be,
if you hadn't decided

03:33.430 --> 03:35.389
to make your romance
with Joe Colombo official.

03:35.432 --> 03:37.521
You really think
that was my decision?

03:37.565 --> 03:38.957
Why didn't you tell me?

03:39.001 --> 03:41.090
Because--Do not answer that.

03:41.133 --> 03:42.700
Maybe nobody's seen it.

03:42.744 --> 03:44.049
Are you kidding me?

03:44.093 --> 03:46.530
Everyone in the five boroughs
has seen this.

03:46.574 --> 03:48.576
Look, I walked
into an ambush, okay?

03:48.619 --> 03:50.055
Joe invited me down
to the League office.

03:50.099 --> 03:51.579
I had no idea that
he was gonna do what he did.

03:51.622 --> 03:53.494
You need to tell
Charlie that.

03:53.537 --> 03:55.191
I need to go to set
because I promised Francis

03:55.235 --> 03:56.279
I'd be there first thing.

03:56.323 --> 03:58.368
No, Bluhdorn first.

03:58.412 --> 03:59.804
Francis needs you
to keep your job, Al,

03:59.848 --> 04:01.066
and so does the rest
of the crew.

04:01.110 --> 04:02.503
Fine. Relax.
Nobody's losing their job.

04:03.982 --> 04:05.114
I wish I had your confidence.

04:05.157 --> 04:07.377
It's kinda all I got.

04:07.421 --> 04:09.858
Barney says we're gonna open
four points down

04:09.901 --> 04:11.207
and that there's gonna be
blood in the streets.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.122
Fuck.And the "Journal," Jesus.

04:13.165 --> 04:15.820
"Is Gulf and Western in
business with organized crime?"

04:15.864 --> 04:18.301
I don't need you reading me
the fucking papers.

04:18.345 --> 04:20.216
Where's--the head of PR.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.565
Where the hell
have you been, Gary?

04:21.609 --> 04:23.350
I--I was just--

04:23.393 --> 04:25.439
we've been monitoring
the situation.

04:25.482 --> 04:26.962
Monitoring the situation.

04:27.005 --> 04:28.398
Where from?
Your bedroom?

04:28.442 --> 04:30.313
You're fired.I'm what?

04:30.357 --> 04:31.836
Charlie, I don't--The story broke this morning

04:31.880 --> 04:34.317
and now you're just starting
to think about damage control.

04:34.361 --> 04:35.971
You fucked up. You're fired.

04:36.014 --> 04:38.190
It broke two hours ago.
How is this my fault?

04:38.234 --> 04:39.583
You are lucky
this window doesn't open.

04:39.627 --> 04:40.628
Get out!

04:43.021 --> 04:44.458
Charlie,
I don't think it's prudent

04:44.501 --> 04:45.894
to fire the head of PR--

04:45.937 --> 04:47.417
I don't believe
I asked for your opinion.

04:47.461 --> 04:48.984
Where are we on the sale?

04:49.027 --> 04:50.464
We're still in
preliminary talks.

04:50.507 --> 04:52.466
We had four interested buyers.

04:52.509 --> 04:54.772
But after this fiasco--Line up calls this morning.

04:54.816 --> 04:56.992
I want Paramount off my books
by the end of the day.

05:01.475 --> 05:02.563
What do we tell Evans?

05:02.606 --> 05:04.304
Screw Evans.

05:04.347 --> 05:07.263
After today, that oily fuck
is someone else's problem.

05:20.407 --> 05:22.278
This is gonna be
a shit storm.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.627
You don't know that for sure.

05:23.671 --> 05:25.194
The producer of my movie

05:25.237 --> 05:27.849
just shook hands
with a goddamn mobster on TV.

05:27.892 --> 05:29.329
I gotta get to New York.

05:29.372 --> 05:31.156
- Waldorf Astoria.- Al Ruddy, 304.

05:31.200 --> 05:32.244
Are you kidding me?

05:32.288 --> 05:33.724
Do I look like
I'm kidding you?

05:33.768 --> 05:35.857
We're in deep shit, babe.

05:35.900 --> 05:37.772
We're going to Texas,
remember?

05:37.815 --> 05:40.470
My movie, dinner at McQueen's?

05:40.514 --> 05:41.863
Or do you just forget
every promise you make

05:41.906 --> 05:42.951
the second
it leaves your mouth?

05:42.994 --> 05:45.170
I have to deal with this
right now.

05:45.214 --> 05:46.998
I'll meet you there later.Oh, yes.

05:47.042 --> 05:48.217
I'll hold my breath
waiting on that promise.

05:48.260 --> 05:49.697
Hello, sir?Yeah.

05:49.740 --> 05:50.567
I'm sorry.
Mr. Ruddy doesn't appear

05:50.611 --> 05:51.960
to be in his room.

05:52.003 --> 05:54.528
I can leave a message
if you want.

05:54.571 --> 05:56.791
Fuck.

05:56.834 --> 05:58.401
I'll have the office
get the jet ready.

05:58.445 --> 06:00.403
You're literally
going to New York right now?

06:00.447 --> 06:01.839
If Ruddy manages
to survive this thing,

06:01.883 --> 06:03.275
he's gonna need backup,
and if he doesn't,

06:03.319 --> 06:04.929
I gotta be there
to produce this thing myself.

06:04.973 --> 06:06.583
Don't you have people
that work for you

06:06.627 --> 06:07.454
who can deal with this?

06:07.497 --> 06:09.238
Honey!

06:09.281 --> 06:11.109
I'm the head
of the goddamn studio.

06:11.153 --> 06:13.808
I am the fucking people
that deal with this.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.428
I'll take one of those.

06:25.472 --> 06:27.430
And, ooh,
one with sprinkles.

06:27.474 --> 06:29.258
Or two.

06:29.301 --> 06:32.174
Guys, another five feet
of track toward the corner.

06:32.217 --> 06:33.480
Okay.

06:33.523 --> 06:35.482
No doughnuts?Oh, I already had two.

06:35.525 --> 06:36.526
Hey, thanks
for getting the truck.

06:36.570 --> 06:37.614
It was very nice to you.

06:37.658 --> 06:39.399
All right, just about ready.Great.

06:41.183 --> 06:43.054
Francis.

06:43.098 --> 06:44.969
We're finally here, huh?

06:45.013 --> 06:47.232
We're making snow.
I mean, this is great.

06:48.756 --> 06:50.932
Oh,
it's very exciting, Mario.

06:50.975 --> 06:53.108
We wouldn't be here
without your beautiful words.

06:53.151 --> 06:54.849
You and I make
a hell of a team.

06:54.892 --> 06:55.850
Hmm?Yeah.

06:55.893 --> 06:57.373
Where's Ruddy?

06:57.417 --> 06:59.114
Good question.

06:59.157 --> 07:00.332
He should be here any minute.

07:01.856 --> 07:03.205
Freddy.Yeah.

07:03.248 --> 07:04.989
Where's Ruddy?Haven't seen him.

07:07.688 --> 07:09.690
Okay.

07:09.733 --> 07:11.474
Let's do it.

07:11.518 --> 07:12.997
Okay.

07:13.041 --> 07:14.390
Everybody, first shot is up.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.479
Lock it down.
Quiet on set.

07:18.525 --> 07:20.222
Places, everyone.

07:20.265 --> 07:21.310
Where is he going?

07:30.493 --> 07:33.191
Off to a great start.

07:33.235 --> 07:35.933
What do you think?

07:35.977 --> 07:37.544
Do we really need
a dozen picture cars,

07:37.587 --> 07:39.502
140 extras

07:39.546 --> 07:43.245
just for a shot of two people
walking down the sidewalk?

07:43.288 --> 07:44.899
We could have shot it tight
and been done by now.

07:44.942 --> 07:46.204
And what's with
all the presents?

07:46.248 --> 07:48.293
It makes him look
even smaller than he is.

07:48.337 --> 07:50.905
That is no leading man.

07:50.948 --> 07:52.515
So what are we gonna
do about it?

07:55.518 --> 07:57.085
Give them enough rope.

08:01.742 --> 08:03.395
- Al?- Yeah.

08:04.571 --> 08:06.137
You okay?Oh, yeah.

08:06.181 --> 08:08.792
I'm, uh, I'm just
a little nervous, you know.

08:09.967 --> 08:11.316
I'm holding presents
and everything.

08:11.360 --> 08:12.970
The lines keep flying
out of my head.

08:13.014 --> 08:14.494
Yeah.

08:14.537 --> 08:15.625
Hey, I don't really care

08:15.669 --> 08:17.801
if you get all the lines
exactly right.

08:17.845 --> 08:19.542
Don't tell Puzo.

08:19.586 --> 08:22.110
Okay, okay.

08:22.153 --> 08:24.286
The motivation, that's
the most important thing,

08:24.329 --> 08:26.027
and you got that.

08:26.070 --> 08:28.420
Look at this beautiful girl.
Look in her eyes.

08:28.464 --> 08:29.509
Yeah?

08:29.552 --> 08:30.771
Just be in the moment

08:30.814 --> 08:32.120
with this woman that you love.

08:33.425 --> 08:35.297
That's all I need.

08:35.340 --> 08:37.908
All right.
I could do that.

08:37.952 --> 08:39.083
You wanna try one?

08:40.432 --> 08:42.217
Yeah.All right, let's do it.

08:44.045 --> 08:45.133
Give it a shot.

08:45.176 --> 08:46.961
Okay, everyone.
Here we go.

09:01.192 --> 09:02.498
Did he at least yell "fore"?

09:04.500 --> 09:06.110
You're funny, huh?

09:06.154 --> 09:08.460
Oh, that's right.
You got your start in sitcoms.

09:10.419 --> 09:12.508
Look, is he coming or not?
Because I gotta get to set.

09:13.727 --> 09:15.076
Charlie,

09:15.119 --> 09:16.599
I'm sure you--Shut the hell up.

09:16.643 --> 09:18.601
Zip it, I don't wanna hear
your fucking voice.

09:18.645 --> 09:19.646
What the hell is this?

09:19.689 --> 09:21.691
Al brought you
a little gift.

09:22.866 --> 09:24.520
Ah, pastries.

09:26.261 --> 09:27.610
You fucked me, Ruddy.

09:27.654 --> 09:29.612
You fucked me good.
You destroyed my company.

09:29.656 --> 09:30.700
I'm sorry,
but it's not my job

09:30.744 --> 09:32.136
to care about your company.

09:32.180 --> 09:33.834
My job is to do
what's best for the movie

09:33.877 --> 09:35.096
and I would do it
all over again.

09:35.139 --> 09:37.054
Is that so?Yeah, that's so.

09:37.098 --> 09:38.882
You're in bed
with the fucking mafia

09:38.926 --> 09:40.362
for the whole world to see.

09:40.405 --> 09:42.016
There's not a single
production in this town

09:42.059 --> 09:43.191
that isn't, okay?

09:43.234 --> 09:44.148
The unions, the Teamsters.

09:44.192 --> 09:45.367
Who do you think controls them?

09:45.410 --> 09:47.108
And I'm sorry,
but I didn't exactly

09:47.151 --> 09:48.892
see anybody at this office
lining up to deal with them.

09:48.936 --> 09:50.024
Yeah, for good reason.

09:50.067 --> 09:51.547
And I don't see
any other producers

09:51.591 --> 09:53.941
holding their hand
on the front page of the paper.

09:54.942 --> 09:56.683
I did what I had to do.

09:56.726 --> 09:58.336
So either fire me
or let me get to work.

09:58.380 --> 09:59.773
There is no "or."

09:59.816 --> 10:01.165
You're fired.

10:01.209 --> 10:03.254
Get the fuck out.

10:09.043 --> 10:10.653
Good luck finding somebody
that'll do my job.

10:17.791 --> 10:19.314
Mr. Bluhdorn,

10:19.357 --> 10:21.621
Mr. Dunston's here to see you.
He says it's urgent.

10:45.732 --> 10:47.429
Al, what's going on?

10:47.472 --> 10:49.605
Why do you have
Charlie's cigars?

10:49.649 --> 10:51.999
He fired you.

10:52.042 --> 10:53.304
Call Evans.

10:53.348 --> 10:54.436
He won't wanna bring on
somebody new.

10:54.479 --> 10:55.742
He's not returning my calls.

10:55.785 --> 10:57.787
It will take them
way too long to catch up

10:57.831 --> 10:59.441
and that's money
out of their pockets.

10:59.484 --> 11:00.616
Maybe I can talk to Charlie.

11:00.660 --> 11:01.878
Fuck Charlie.

11:01.922 --> 11:03.924
And Lapidus and Bob.
They don't get it.

11:03.967 --> 11:06.317
So make them get it.
Don't just walk away.

11:06.361 --> 11:07.971
I don't really have
much of a choice.

11:11.758 --> 11:12.933
Al, what do you
want me to do?

11:12.976 --> 11:15.109
I don't know.
Go back to Oklahoma.

11:15.152 --> 11:17.024
Go back to your pies,
your husband.

11:17.067 --> 11:18.895
I don't care.

11:18.939 --> 11:20.897
You selfish prick.

11:20.941 --> 11:22.116
Hey!

11:22.159 --> 11:24.161
When you cozied up
next to Colombo,

11:24.205 --> 11:25.685
did you ever stop and think
about what would happen?

11:25.728 --> 11:26.947
About the repercussions?

11:26.990 --> 11:28.426
About what that meant
for the rest of us?

11:28.470 --> 11:30.211
No, but it wasn't
exactly my idea.

11:30.254 --> 11:31.734
No one forced you
to have your picture taken.

11:31.778 --> 11:33.083
You try saying no
to Joe Colombo.

11:33.127 --> 11:34.563
Let me know how that
works out for you.

11:34.606 --> 11:35.695
You did it because
you were thinking

11:35.738 --> 11:37.000
of nobody but yourself.

11:37.044 --> 11:39.089
You bulldoze through life
with blinders on,

11:39.133 --> 11:40.917
just focusing on
what is right in front of you.

11:40.961 --> 11:42.832
And that is great for you
and your job,

11:42.876 --> 11:44.791
but it sucks for those of us

11:44.834 --> 11:46.444
who are stuck
standing behind you,

11:46.488 --> 11:47.750
trying to protect you

11:47.794 --> 11:48.882
from whatever is outside
of your eye line.

11:48.925 --> 11:51.058
I didn't hire you
to protect me.

11:51.101 --> 11:52.624
You're a fucking assistant.

11:52.668 --> 11:54.191
Go find another fucking job.

12:14.821 --> 12:16.344
You know what?

12:16.387 --> 12:18.868
Whatever that crazy Austrian
thinks he wants to do,

12:18.912 --> 12:20.391
we're gonna stop him.

12:20.435 --> 12:21.871
G and W's cratering,
you know?

12:21.915 --> 12:24.134
He's losing his shit.We're ready, Peter.

12:24.178 --> 12:25.832
"Love Story"
has made him a ton.

12:25.875 --> 12:27.181
If we can just get
"The Godfather" out there--

12:27.224 --> 12:28.573
Two hits in a row.

12:28.617 --> 12:29.618
We show Charlie
we're back to printing money.

12:29.661 --> 12:31.402
Bottom line, baby,
bottom line.

12:31.446 --> 12:32.926
That's all he cares about.

12:32.969 --> 12:34.666
But if he fires Ruddy
and Ballard takes over--

12:36.407 --> 12:38.279
It's gonna be a shit storm
for the picture.

12:40.629 --> 12:42.065
Fuck it.

12:42.109 --> 12:44.502
Fuck it.
I'll produce the movie myself.

12:52.380 --> 12:53.642
Big, big misunderstanding,
Dickie.

12:53.685 --> 12:55.209
Al Ruddy is a two-bit producer

12:55.252 --> 12:56.993
who has no authority
to speak for us.

12:57.037 --> 12:58.734
He's been terminated.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.605
We're dealing with the fallout,
but we'll survive.

13:00.649 --> 13:02.999
Survive?
That's what you think I want?

13:03.043 --> 13:04.914
Look at this headline.It's bad.

13:04.958 --> 13:06.916
We understand,
but Charlie's handling it.

13:06.960 --> 13:08.613
It'll be a bumpy week,

13:08.657 --> 13:10.224
but G and W
is bigger than Paramount.

13:10.267 --> 13:12.313
I told you we shouldn't be
in the goddamn movie business.

13:12.356 --> 13:14.054
We're not--I'm dealing with it.

13:15.055 --> 13:16.186
I don't think
you're equipped to, Charlie.

13:17.318 --> 13:18.885
I think you need help.

13:18.928 --> 13:20.974
I called an emergency
board meeting this afternoon

13:21.017 --> 13:23.019
so we can offload this quickly.

13:23.063 --> 13:24.281
You better have some people
ready to buy.

13:25.935 --> 13:28.677
Fine.
I'll see you at the meeting.

13:28.720 --> 13:30.200
We'll stock the bar.

13:36.511 --> 13:38.818
You said you could
control Gallo.

13:38.861 --> 13:40.384
I'm gonna take care of it,
Carlo.

13:40.428 --> 13:42.865
Don't you worry about that.

13:42.909 --> 13:44.345
We trusted you.

13:46.434 --> 13:50.046
You said that don't worry
once before, yet here we are.

13:50.090 --> 13:52.788
He blew Carmine's head off
with a sawed-off shotgun.

13:52.832 --> 13:53.963
I thought this was
gonna be peaceful but--

13:54.007 --> 13:57.227
This cannot escalate.

13:57.271 --> 13:59.142
We cannot have another war.

14:01.318 --> 14:02.624
Then what happens?

14:02.667 --> 14:04.887
I just sit on my hands
and wait for this--

14:04.931 --> 14:06.497
while this fucking animal
runs wild?

14:06.541 --> 14:07.716
I'll talk to Gallo.

14:07.759 --> 14:09.587
What good is that gonna do?

14:09.631 --> 14:11.372
Huh?

14:11.415 --> 14:13.635
If he had done this
to a member of your family,

14:13.678 --> 14:15.680
what would you do?
You'd talk to him?

14:15.724 --> 14:17.073
It's a sensitive matter, Joe.

14:17.117 --> 14:18.509
Come on, come on.

14:22.513 --> 14:23.819
I want your word

14:23.863 --> 14:26.735
you will not take any action
at this time.

14:28.737 --> 14:30.217
I want your word.Okay.

14:31.435 --> 14:32.567
Okay.

14:32.610 --> 14:33.960
You have my word.

14:41.402 --> 14:42.620
Okay.

14:53.109 --> 14:54.154
Let's go.

15:01.770 --> 15:02.902
How you doin', Joe?

15:05.992 --> 15:08.559
You should've
stayed in prison.

15:08.603 --> 15:09.952
It was safer for you there.

15:09.996 --> 15:12.607
Yeah, okay.

15:12.650 --> 15:14.087
Hey, Joe.What?

15:17.003 --> 15:18.656
For Carmine's family.

15:20.963 --> 15:22.922
Okay. Okay.

15:23.661 --> 15:25.228
I wanted to pay
my respects.

15:31.147 --> 15:32.975
It's $1,000, Joe.

15:33.889 --> 15:34.846
Go ahead, count it.

15:40.765 --> 15:42.245
Ciao, Joe.

15:50.775 --> 15:51.863
Morning, Bettye.

15:51.907 --> 15:52.995
I need to see him.
It's urgent.

15:53.039 --> 15:54.040
It's not a good day.

15:54.083 --> 15:55.650
This cannot wait.

15:55.693 --> 15:57.608
Trust me,
now is not the time.

16:04.615 --> 16:06.008
Thank you.

16:08.750 --> 16:10.404
Where are we with buyers?

16:10.447 --> 16:13.363
Well, yesterday we had
four potential suitors

16:13.407 --> 16:14.799
looking to acquire Paramount.

16:14.843 --> 16:16.018
So who are we calling first?

16:16.062 --> 16:18.412
But this morning,
three of them called

16:18.455 --> 16:21.110
to formally withdraw
their bids.

16:21.154 --> 16:23.069
No one wants to be
in bed with the mob, Charlie.

16:23.112 --> 16:24.418
Fucking Ruddy.

16:24.461 --> 16:25.723
We do have one option,
though.

16:25.767 --> 16:28.335
It's this guy out of Texas,
oil money.

16:28.378 --> 16:29.989
It's not my first choice

16:30.032 --> 16:31.903
but that's what's
still on the table.

16:31.947 --> 16:32.948
Set up a lunch.

16:32.992 --> 16:35.168
Tell Texas
he has to meet us today.

16:35.211 --> 16:36.386
That's short notice.
I'm not sure--

16:36.430 --> 16:38.519
Today.

16:43.176 --> 16:45.395
Cut!That's a cut.

16:45.439 --> 16:46.483
Check the gate.

16:49.356 --> 16:51.097
Terrific.
It's terrific.

16:51.140 --> 16:52.489
How did that feel for you?

16:52.533 --> 16:53.838
Feel good?It was great.

16:53.882 --> 16:55.101
Really good for me.

16:55.144 --> 16:56.667
And thank you
for taking the pressure off.

16:56.711 --> 16:58.495
I'm so glad
we started with this.

16:58.539 --> 16:59.931
So nice of you to join us

16:59.975 --> 17:01.585
after the scene
already wrapped.

17:01.629 --> 17:03.544
Moving on.
Ruddy?

17:03.587 --> 17:05.198
Francis, let me talk to you
for a sec.

17:05.241 --> 17:06.721
I saw the headlines
and I thought

17:06.764 --> 17:07.983
they were gonna fire you
for sure.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.158
They did fire me.

17:10.725 --> 17:12.161
What--what are you
talking about?

17:12.205 --> 17:13.510
They can't do that.

17:13.554 --> 17:16.035
It's the first day of shooting.It's done.

17:16.078 --> 17:17.210
I just came by
to tell you something

17:17.253 --> 17:18.689
before I head out.

17:18.733 --> 17:21.083
You're gonna make
a beautiful film.

17:21.127 --> 17:22.606
You got your yellow.

17:26.741 --> 17:28.003
And another thing.Yeah.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.396
Grow eyes on the back
of your head.

17:29.439 --> 17:30.397
Ballard's out for blood.

17:32.007 --> 17:33.617
What are you doing now?I don't know,

17:33.661 --> 17:35.097
but there's probably a drink
in my future.

17:36.881 --> 17:38.709
You got this.

17:40.581 --> 17:42.583
Ruddy, what--

17:42.626 --> 17:44.106
where's Ruddy going?
Why's he leaving?

17:44.150 --> 17:45.325
Something wicked
this way comes.

17:45.368 --> 17:46.891
Hey, Jean.

17:46.935 --> 17:48.937
Can I talk to you for a second?
Do me a favor.

17:48.980 --> 17:50.025
When we get
to the next location,

17:50.069 --> 17:51.157
I want you
to find me a telephone.

17:51.200 --> 17:52.506
You get Charlie Bluhdorn
on the line.

17:52.549 --> 17:54.247
You tell him it's an emergency.

17:55.291 --> 17:56.727
Hey, Jack, look at that.
We're ahead of schedule.

17:56.771 --> 17:58.816
Yeah, good start.
Let's keep it that way.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.386
Keep it that way.

18:10.393 --> 18:11.568
Hey. Come here.

18:21.230 --> 18:22.449
Where is everybody?

18:22.492 --> 18:24.799
Where is every--
this is everybody.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.019
Well, who else
are you waiting on?

18:28.063 --> 18:30.021
You.

18:30.065 --> 18:31.240
Sit down.

18:36.550 --> 18:38.813
It's just you and me?

18:38.856 --> 18:39.814
Take it easy.

18:39.857 --> 18:42.512
Here, have some wine.

18:42.556 --> 18:44.384
I got some antipasti coming.

18:55.046 --> 18:56.004
What's the matter with you?

18:56.047 --> 18:57.353
Every time I see you,

18:57.397 --> 18:58.485
you're choking down
on some fucking hoagie

18:58.528 --> 18:59.834
and now all of a sudden
you're shy?

18:59.877 --> 19:01.444
Come on, eat.

19:01.488 --> 19:03.272
I gotta talk to you.

19:03.316 --> 19:04.795
Yeah, we talk every day.

19:04.839 --> 19:06.406
Yeah, but this is
a different kind of talk.

19:08.408 --> 19:09.583
Okay.

19:12.760 --> 19:15.154
How's your nonna doing?

19:15.197 --> 19:16.198
She's all right.

19:16.242 --> 19:17.199
You know, when I was a kid,

19:17.243 --> 19:18.244
I'd be playing with my friends

19:18.287 --> 19:19.897
out on the street.

19:19.941 --> 19:21.682
If it got late,
she'd come out screaming,

19:21.725 --> 19:23.466
waving a broom handle around.

19:23.510 --> 19:27.383
She'd say, "Vai a casa,
vai a casa, you bad boys."

19:27.427 --> 19:28.863
And if she caught you,

19:28.906 --> 19:30.952
she'd beat the shit
out of you with that thing.

19:30.995 --> 19:32.214
But you know what?

19:32.258 --> 19:34.477
No matter what I did,

19:34.521 --> 19:36.218
she never told my mother.

19:36.262 --> 19:38.220
Some things never change.

19:38.264 --> 19:39.178
She's still a tough broad.

19:41.658 --> 19:43.225
How long have
we known each other?

19:44.183 --> 19:46.054
My whole life.

19:49.840 --> 19:51.320
You know,

19:51.364 --> 19:53.061
after this business
with Carmine...

19:55.324 --> 19:58.153
I realized I never asked you
what you wanted to do.

19:59.589 --> 20:00.764
What do you mean?

20:03.114 --> 20:05.595
Well, sometimes in life,

20:05.639 --> 20:08.163
unfortunate things
present opportunities.

20:11.384 --> 20:14.561
But to take it,
you gotta be ready to step up.

20:16.432 --> 20:17.781
Really be a man.

20:20.610 --> 20:21.742
Is that what you want?

20:21.785 --> 20:23.352
Yeah.

20:24.484 --> 20:25.485
Think about it.

20:25.528 --> 20:27.313
No, I don't need to.

20:27.356 --> 20:29.576
I'm ready.

20:29.619 --> 20:31.534
I'm with you.

20:36.017 --> 20:37.888
Cin cin.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.086
Barry,
if you don't order steak,

21:02.130 --> 21:04.611
I'll stick you with a fork.

21:04.654 --> 21:06.700
Oil people,
they don't trust fish.

21:06.743 --> 21:09.355
Well, technically,
caviar is fish.

21:09.398 --> 21:12.619
It's a delicacy
and expensive as fuck.

21:12.662 --> 21:13.881
This must be him.

21:17.014 --> 21:18.233
Andy Calhoun.

21:18.277 --> 21:19.713
Does your father
know you're here?

21:19.756 --> 21:22.542
Mr. Bluhdorn,
your reputation precedes you.

21:22.585 --> 21:23.934
Barry Lapidus.
We spoke on the phone.

21:23.978 --> 21:25.371
You spoke to my brother.

21:25.414 --> 21:27.068
He drank a little too much
on the jet.

21:27.111 --> 21:29.331
So you just get me today.

21:30.854 --> 21:31.855
What can I get you, sir?

21:31.899 --> 21:33.814
Sparkling water.
Thanks.

21:33.857 --> 21:36.817
How can I trust a man
who drinks seltzer with caviar?

21:36.860 --> 21:38.427
Oh, no worries there.

21:38.471 --> 21:41.778
I hate caviar.

21:41.822 --> 21:44.346
Well, the steaks here
are fantastic.

21:44.390 --> 21:46.392
Ah, business works up
my appetite.

21:48.394 --> 21:50.396
I love movies, Mr. Bluhdorn.

21:50.439 --> 21:52.049
I always have.

21:52.093 --> 21:53.660
It's a sexy business.

21:53.703 --> 21:55.183
It's full of vagrants
and lowlifes,

21:55.226 --> 21:57.359
but if you hit it right.

21:57.403 --> 21:59.753
"Love Story."
Have you seen it?

21:59.796 --> 22:02.016
I took my mom.
She loved it.

22:02.059 --> 22:03.365
Takes his mother
to the movies.

22:03.409 --> 22:05.541
That's a good kid.

22:05.585 --> 22:07.630
Calhoun, I love Paramount

22:07.674 --> 22:10.416
but Gulf and Western is so big
that it takes up

22:10.459 --> 22:12.722
more of my attention
these days.

22:12.766 --> 22:14.202
So we're looking--I'm sure recent headlines

22:14.245 --> 22:17.031
make it a little easier
to part with Paramount.

22:24.473 --> 22:26.040
Thank you.

22:26.083 --> 22:28.956
Your offer was definitely
in the ballpark, Andy.

22:28.999 --> 22:32.786
Oh, well, we're in
a new ballpark now, Barry.

22:32.829 --> 22:34.614
Based on the news,
I would assume

22:34.657 --> 22:37.530
some sort of discount
from what we discussed.

22:39.096 --> 22:40.707
We're open
to an accommodation

22:40.750 --> 22:42.361
given the circumstances.

22:42.404 --> 22:43.753
Oh, well, I'm glad
to hear that

22:43.797 --> 22:47.061
because my first, middle,
and final offer

22:47.104 --> 22:49.411
is 50%.

23:15.698 --> 23:16.699
Sorry, sweetie.

23:16.743 --> 23:17.657
No women allowed.

23:18.832 --> 23:21.051
Really?

23:21.095 --> 23:22.923
Bettye.Hi.

23:22.966 --> 23:24.403
What are you doing
in Brooklyn?

23:25.534 --> 23:26.709
Um--

23:40.375 --> 23:41.811
That one right there.

23:43.509 --> 23:45.946
Mr. Colombo.

23:45.989 --> 23:46.903
You know,
you could've called.

23:46.947 --> 23:48.383
You can call me anytime.

23:48.427 --> 23:49.515
Thank you.

23:49.558 --> 23:51.734
I know how phones can be.

23:51.778 --> 23:53.040
Smart girl.

23:53.083 --> 23:54.694
Ruddy's lucky to have you.
Here, sit down.

23:57.914 --> 24:00.526
Ruddy was lucky to have me.

24:00.569 --> 24:02.397
Oh, what's that's
supposed to mean?

24:04.834 --> 24:06.749
I just wanted to come
and tell you in person

24:06.793 --> 24:08.621
that Ruddy's been fired
off the movie.

24:11.232 --> 24:13.408
They can't do that.

24:13.452 --> 24:14.453
What happened?

24:16.498 --> 24:18.457
Don't be nervous. Here.

24:19.327 --> 24:20.850
Thank you.

24:27.596 --> 24:28.858
It's good.

24:35.561 --> 24:37.867
They're pissed about this.

24:40.130 --> 24:41.523
Look.

24:41.567 --> 24:43.873
Ruddy did what he had to do.

24:43.917 --> 24:45.832
He's a stand-up guy that way.

24:45.875 --> 24:48.530
The suits
at Gulf and Western,

24:48.574 --> 24:50.053
they don't see it like that.

24:51.402 --> 24:53.100
Is that right?Mm-hmm.

24:56.756 --> 24:59.019
Well, thank you
for telling me.

24:59.062 --> 25:01.151
I'm gonna look into this.

25:01.195 --> 25:04.546
Don't you worry
your pretty little head, okay?

25:04.590 --> 25:07.506
Listen, you got some stones
coming in here.

25:07.549 --> 25:09.508
All my life, I ain't ever seen
a broad inside.

25:12.293 --> 25:14.513
I'm not trying
to make history.

25:14.556 --> 25:16.906
I just came for Ruddy.

25:16.950 --> 25:19.518
Thank you.Okay, okay.

25:21.607 --> 25:23.565
Come to my office.

25:23.609 --> 25:25.872
I can't believe
they fired Ruddy.

25:25.915 --> 25:27.700
Who's gonna produce
the picture now, huh?

25:27.743 --> 25:29.223
What are we gonna do?

25:29.266 --> 25:30.746
What are we gonna do?

25:30.790 --> 25:32.574
We're gonna make the best
damn picture we possibly can.

25:32.618 --> 25:33.488
That's what we're gonna do.

25:35.272 --> 25:37.057
Okay.

25:38.885 --> 25:39.973
Okay.

25:42.149 --> 25:43.585
Good.

25:43.629 --> 25:46.370
Michael and Enzo right here.

25:46.414 --> 25:47.720
They're looking down.

25:47.763 --> 25:49.504
They see the hitman car

25:49.548 --> 25:51.811
drives up to right about here.
They look up, they see them.

25:51.854 --> 25:54.117
They think
they're muscle, right?

25:54.161 --> 25:55.771
And then they keep driving.

25:55.815 --> 25:57.207
Next part of the scene
we play here

25:57.251 --> 25:59.645
where Michael
gets his jaw broke by McClusky.

25:59.688 --> 26:01.995
And then we have
Tom Hagen's car

26:02.038 --> 26:04.650
stops here and that's it.
That's the end of the scene.

26:04.693 --> 26:06.042
We play everything
on this spot.

26:06.086 --> 26:08.044
I need a 5K
across the street for this.

26:08.088 --> 26:09.045
Like it's the moon or--

26:09.089 --> 26:11.178
No, like a street lamp.

26:11.221 --> 26:12.266
Questions?

26:13.746 --> 26:15.008
Okay, let's do it.

26:15.051 --> 26:16.662
All right.
Set belongs to the crew.

26:16.705 --> 26:18.446
First shot from the street
looking up the stairs.

26:31.111 --> 26:33.026
We should take it.

26:33.069 --> 26:34.418
In this climate,

26:34.462 --> 26:36.116
the faster we can sell
Paramount the better.

26:36.159 --> 26:38.248
I know it's not
what we were looking for, but--

26:39.902 --> 26:42.470
Big fucking
Wharton bullshit fuck!

26:42.513 --> 26:45.908
You never show your hand,
you desperate fucking idiot.

26:45.952 --> 26:49.433
You never let them know
what we're thinking.

27:11.281 --> 27:13.327
Hello?Al, it's Joe.

27:13.370 --> 27:17.070
Listen, I heard
about what happened.

27:17.113 --> 27:19.159
It ain't gonna stand.
I'm shutting this down.

27:19.202 --> 27:21.161
No, Joe,
you gotta listen to me.

27:21.204 --> 27:23.424
I appreciate that, but this--
this movie's important

27:23.467 --> 27:24.991
to a lot of people
so please don't--

27:25.034 --> 27:26.993
No, no, fuck that.
I let you make the movie.

27:27.036 --> 27:28.168
I didn't let them make it.

27:28.211 --> 27:30.387
You're my guy.

27:30.431 --> 27:32.085
No you, no movie.

27:32.128 --> 27:34.304
But Joe--

27:53.062 --> 27:54.020
How you doing?

28:06.946 --> 28:08.817
Francis, you need something
for lunch?

28:08.861 --> 28:12.516
Freddy,
I need this truck to move.

28:12.560 --> 28:14.214
Can somebody move
this fucking truck?

28:14.257 --> 28:15.606
It's in the picture

28:15.650 --> 28:16.999
and we need to get started
right after lunch.

28:17.043 --> 28:17.913
Thank you.

28:17.957 --> 28:19.480
Hey, Francis.Yes.

28:19.523 --> 28:20.916
We got a problem.

28:20.960 --> 28:22.962
What kind of a problem?

28:23.005 --> 28:24.528
Union problem.

28:24.572 --> 28:25.791
Some of the crew,
they're threatening

28:25.834 --> 28:27.662
not to come back after lunch.

28:27.706 --> 28:28.837
You're kidding me.
Why?

28:28.881 --> 28:30.404
I can't say for sure,

28:30.447 --> 28:32.711
but we know who's got control
over the unions, right?

28:35.931 --> 28:37.672
You did the right thing.

28:39.630 --> 28:41.023
I hope so.

28:48.639 --> 28:50.990
Hey, there, beautiful.

28:51.033 --> 28:53.253
I need to see Charlie
right away.

28:53.296 --> 28:54.515
I'm sorry, Mr. Evans.

28:54.558 --> 28:56.343
He's in an emergency
board meeting.

29:04.612 --> 29:05.918
Gentlemen,

29:05.961 --> 29:07.789
I think we can all agree
that Paramount Pictures

29:07.833 --> 29:10.052
is an embarrassment
to Gulf and Western.

29:10.096 --> 29:12.054
I move the motion
to sell Paramount Pictures

29:12.098 --> 29:13.882
to Calhoun Enterprises.

29:13.926 --> 29:14.883
Forward to a vote.

29:24.893 --> 29:26.460
Sorry, it was--it was locked.

29:26.503 --> 29:27.896
Bob, this is outrageous.

29:27.940 --> 29:29.593
You can't just storm in--Evans.

29:29.637 --> 29:31.247
Got something to say?

29:31.291 --> 29:32.683
Yeah.

29:32.727 --> 29:33.946
I do, Charlie, yeah.

29:33.989 --> 29:35.295
Sit down, Barry.

29:39.299 --> 29:40.561
Thank you, Barry.

29:42.868 --> 29:44.826
Hello, everyone.

29:44.870 --> 29:46.219
I'm Robert Evans,

29:46.262 --> 29:47.742
Senior Vice President
of Paramount Pictures.

29:51.485 --> 29:54.183
Now, look, last few years
have been rough for Hollywood.

29:56.185 --> 29:59.188
I'm sure the only question
on your minds is,

29:59.232 --> 30:01.843
should you sell short
or go long?

30:01.887 --> 30:03.802
And I understand that.

30:03.845 --> 30:06.152
I do.
You're a Fortune 500 company.

30:06.195 --> 30:07.762
You're worried
about your reputation.

30:07.806 --> 30:09.938
But take a look around
this table.

30:09.982 --> 30:12.985
You're politicians, innovators,
captains of industry.

30:13.028 --> 30:15.814
None of you are sitting here
because you played it safe.

30:15.857 --> 30:19.469
And you all know in some ways
that the most important tool

30:19.513 --> 30:22.037
to help you in your pursuits
is loyalty.

30:22.081 --> 30:23.386
But you don't want investors

30:23.430 --> 30:24.692
looking for a good time
on a park bench.

30:24.735 --> 30:26.433
No, you want to develop
a deep relationship.

30:26.476 --> 30:29.871
You want to create trust
and love.

30:29.915 --> 30:32.265
But you can't do that
with empty promises.

30:32.308 --> 30:34.702
No, you have to--

30:34.745 --> 30:35.877
you have to feed their souls.

30:35.921 --> 30:37.487
Now, how do you do that?
Well, that's hard.

30:37.531 --> 30:40.229
That is hard.

30:40.273 --> 30:43.580
Right now,
the soul of America is broken.

30:43.624 --> 30:45.756
War, assassination,
civil rights protests.

30:45.800 --> 30:47.802
We're hurting. We're hurting.

30:47.846 --> 30:50.283
And people don't trust
politics or big business.

30:50.326 --> 30:52.807
So what can America look up to?

30:52.851 --> 30:54.113
Well, I'll tell you.
I'll tell you.

30:55.723 --> 30:56.593
Excuse me, Charlie.

31:00.249 --> 31:01.990
Paramount.

31:02.034 --> 31:03.644
Take a look at the logo.

31:06.560 --> 31:07.778
We're the mountaintop.

31:09.432 --> 31:10.999
We're the goddamn
Statue of Liberty

31:11.043 --> 31:14.002
because you can give us
your tired, your poor,

31:14.046 --> 31:15.830
your huddled masses
yearning to breathe free,

31:15.874 --> 31:17.876
and we'll give them
two hours of respite

31:17.919 --> 31:19.573
from the harsh realities
of this world,

31:19.616 --> 31:21.401
complete with--

31:21.444 --> 31:24.143
with popcorn and Coca-Cola.

31:24.186 --> 31:25.448
And we'll do
what other people can't,

31:25.492 --> 31:26.928
we'll entertain them.

31:26.972 --> 31:28.843
We'll give them escape.

31:28.887 --> 31:31.628
We'll feed their souls
until they're fit to burst,

31:31.672 --> 31:32.891
and that's something
that you can't quantify

31:32.934 --> 31:34.240
by checking the stock
on the daily ticker.

31:34.283 --> 31:36.590
So sell short or go long.

31:36.633 --> 31:39.245
Well, a year ago, the answer
might have been obvious.

31:39.288 --> 31:40.594
But then came "Love Story,"
which has grossed

31:40.637 --> 31:42.770
over a hundred million dollars

31:42.813 --> 31:44.119
and fed the souls of America.

31:44.163 --> 31:45.468
And people might say, you know,

31:45.512 --> 31:47.731
"Evans,
you only get lucky once."

31:47.775 --> 31:49.864
At Paramount,
we make our own luck.

31:50.996 --> 31:53.041
"Love Story" was the second
biggest selling

31:53.085 --> 31:54.695
book of the decade
beaten by only one other.

31:56.871 --> 31:58.960
And let me tell you, gentlemen,
you do not throw in the towel.

31:59.004 --> 32:00.005
You do not throw in the towel

32:00.048 --> 32:01.441
when your fighter
is about to land

32:01.484 --> 32:03.051
the second part
of a one, two combination,

32:03.095 --> 32:04.574
and that right cross.

32:04.618 --> 32:06.185
Which is gonna bring us
the championship,

32:06.228 --> 32:07.751
that's gonna bring Paramount
right back to its glory,

32:07.795 --> 32:09.101
well, that's the biggest
selling book of all time.

32:09.144 --> 32:10.537
It's "The Godfather"
and it's ours.

32:10.580 --> 32:11.668
It's ours!

32:13.018 --> 32:16.064
We can feed their souls

32:16.108 --> 32:17.587
because we know people want

32:17.631 --> 32:19.067
more than sugar or auto parts

32:19.111 --> 32:20.416
or whatever else
Gulf and Western does.

32:20.460 --> 32:21.635
They want--
they want stories, Charlie.

32:23.593 --> 32:25.421
They want escape.
They want love.

32:26.422 --> 32:30.644
And they want guns, romance,

32:30.687 --> 32:34.430
and violence,

32:34.474 --> 32:40.045
"Love Story" and...

32:40.088 --> 32:41.307
"The Godfather."

32:45.093 --> 32:46.965
Is that it, Evans?

32:47.008 --> 32:48.662
That's it, Charlie.

32:52.274 --> 32:53.580
Then get out.

33:04.417 --> 33:05.853
Thank you, gentlemen.

33:15.428 --> 33:16.559
He's on, sir.

33:20.824 --> 33:23.218
Mr. Calhoun.

33:23.262 --> 33:25.351
I appreciate all the time
that you've given us,

33:25.394 --> 33:28.180
especially
at such short notice.

33:28.223 --> 33:30.051
I've, um,

33:30.095 --> 33:33.881
given your offer
some serious thought and...

33:33.924 --> 33:38.712
Uh, I'm happy to say that
my board and I have decided...

33:38.755 --> 33:41.062
that you can go fuck yourself,

33:41.106 --> 33:43.717
you inbred,
toothy motherfucker.

33:53.988 --> 33:55.511
Francis Coppola's
on the line.

33:55.555 --> 33:56.686
This is the second time
he's called.

33:56.730 --> 33:58.427
Says it's urgent.

34:01.735 --> 34:02.953
What is it, Francis?

34:02.997 --> 34:04.477
I gotta get Ruddy back.

34:04.520 --> 34:05.913
Uh, I don't care
what you have to do.

34:05.956 --> 34:07.349
Francis, trust me,

34:07.393 --> 34:09.177
the production's better off
without him.

34:09.221 --> 34:11.136
Well, someone ought
to tell that to the mafia

34:11.179 --> 34:13.355
because they're threatening
to shut us down.

34:13.399 --> 34:14.400
Do you understand?

34:14.443 --> 34:16.358
Don't let him get on a plane.

34:16.402 --> 34:20.449
They're gonna stop everything.
I need you to please stop him.

34:20.493 --> 34:22.321
This movie's never gonna
get made without him.

34:25.672 --> 34:26.977
Charlie.

34:29.632 --> 34:32.244
I can't believe
you talked to Joe Colombo.

34:32.287 --> 34:34.811
Even I wouldn't talk
to Joe Colombo.

34:34.855 --> 34:36.944
It's the craziest thing
I ever heard.

34:36.987 --> 34:39.207
You're a little--

34:39.251 --> 34:41.905
a little kooky in the head.

34:41.949 --> 34:43.211
My ex-husband
would agree with you.

34:46.084 --> 34:47.737
You know, that's--

34:47.781 --> 34:51.001
that's some loyalty
you got for Ruddy.

34:51.045 --> 34:52.612
I didn't do it for him.

34:52.655 --> 34:54.222
I did it for me.

34:56.050 --> 34:57.791
I'm so sick of living a life

34:57.834 --> 34:59.793
that is determined by
everyone else's choices.

35:01.055 --> 35:02.187
Huh.When I was a kid,

35:02.230 --> 35:04.493
all I ever had
were hand-me-downs.

35:04.537 --> 35:06.539
Nothing I wore
was my style or my choice.

35:08.106 --> 35:09.585
It all depended on
what my siblings wanted

35:09.629 --> 35:10.760
or what they chose.

35:12.414 --> 35:14.155
And then I got married
and moved into a house,

35:14.199 --> 35:16.679
paid for by my husband,

35:16.723 --> 35:18.855
yet another thing
I didn't choose.

35:22.946 --> 35:24.774
I hate that feeling.

35:24.818 --> 35:27.603
Other people making choices
for me

35:27.647 --> 35:30.302
because I don't have the power
to make those choices myself.

35:32.260 --> 35:34.871
So I'm getting Ruddy
his job back.

35:34.915 --> 35:36.221
Or I'm gonna die trying.

35:39.311 --> 35:40.442
Looks like it worked.

35:40.486 --> 35:43.619
Hey, Ruddy, where you been?

35:43.663 --> 35:44.968
Ruddy.

35:45.012 --> 35:46.840
Man, am I glad to see you.

35:46.883 --> 35:48.711
You know that the mob
is trying to shut us down?

35:48.755 --> 35:50.017
Sonny said no one's coming back
after lunch.

35:50.060 --> 35:51.801
I got it. I'll handle it.Okay.

35:53.803 --> 35:54.891
Caesar.

35:54.935 --> 35:57.416
Hey, you're back.I'm back.

35:57.459 --> 35:59.418
Good, 'cause the boss said
nothing moves without you.

35:59.461 --> 36:01.028
Well, I'm here,
so let's get a-moving.

36:02.290 --> 36:04.162
Thanks, buddy.

36:24.356 --> 36:26.706
And I thought you were fired.

36:26.749 --> 36:28.142
I was.

36:28.186 --> 36:29.926
And I am.

36:29.970 --> 36:32.277
Why are you here?

36:32.320 --> 36:34.192
This movie's important
to a lot of people I care about

36:34.235 --> 36:36.194
so I thought
I could help 'em out.

36:36.237 --> 36:38.239
So my backstabbing producer
turns up to save the day

36:38.283 --> 36:39.632
even though
he can't save himself.

36:41.677 --> 36:43.026
Why in God's name

36:43.070 --> 36:45.638
did you do that press
conference with Colombo?

36:45.681 --> 36:48.206
You were threatened.

36:48.249 --> 36:49.468
You asked me to deal with it

36:49.511 --> 36:51.600
and that was my way
of dealing with it.

36:51.644 --> 36:53.820
You are one
crazy motherfucker,

36:53.863 --> 36:55.561
you know that?

36:55.604 --> 36:57.693
Takes one to know one.

36:58.781 --> 36:59.826
We good, you and me?

37:00.914 --> 37:03.482
Always, bubbe.

37:03.525 --> 37:05.266
I wish I could say the same
about you and Bluhdorn.

37:05.310 --> 37:06.441
I'm sorry.

37:12.665 --> 37:13.970
Charlie.

37:14.014 --> 37:15.972
Thank God you came.
I have to tell you,

37:16.016 --> 37:18.540
I have no faith in these--Quiet on set.

37:21.717 --> 37:23.980
Rolling.Sound speed.

37:25.504 --> 37:26.809
Action!

37:33.816 --> 37:35.296
Paramount.

37:35.340 --> 37:37.080
We're the mountaintop.

37:37.124 --> 37:38.734
We're the goddamn
Statue of Liberty

37:38.778 --> 37:41.389
because you can give us
your tired, your poor,

37:41.433 --> 37:43.086
your huddled masses
yearning to breathe free,

37:43.130 --> 37:44.827
and we'll do what
other people can't,

37:44.871 --> 37:46.655
we'll entertain them.

37:46.699 --> 37:50.311
We'll feed their souls
until they're fit to burst.

37:50.355 --> 37:51.791
Cut!

37:51.834 --> 37:53.923
Check the gate.

37:53.967 --> 37:55.055
Would you look at that?

37:56.143 --> 37:58.798
Mob threatens to shut it down,

37:58.841 --> 38:01.453
Ruddy gets it going again.

38:01.496 --> 38:04.412
Who said loyalty
doesn't exist anymore?

38:06.458 --> 38:09.939
I'm guessing
as you're here, Charlie,

38:09.983 --> 38:11.724
Paramount lived
to see another day.

38:14.074 --> 38:16.250
With a performance
like yours,

38:16.294 --> 38:17.904
how could it not?

38:19.906 --> 38:21.951
You know you gotta
hire him back, right?

38:30.525 --> 38:33.615
Looks like you've got
friends in high places.

38:33.659 --> 38:36.183
Not the same places you do.

38:36.226 --> 38:37.619
Yeah, no shit.

38:39.839 --> 38:41.493
If you ever talk
to the press again,

38:41.536 --> 38:43.973
I won't just fucking fire you.

38:44.017 --> 38:45.279
I will kill you.

38:46.585 --> 38:48.326
And I mean that, Ruddy.

38:49.414 --> 38:50.893
Understood, Charlie.

38:55.985 --> 38:57.247
Bettye.

38:57.291 --> 38:59.337
Let's get a drink.

38:59.380 --> 39:00.860
Yeah, just gimme a second.

39:09.608 --> 39:12.524
Apparently,
you're not replaceable.

39:12.567 --> 39:14.221
Bettye.

39:14.264 --> 39:15.962
I'm sorry.

39:16.005 --> 39:19.269
I should've never have talked
to you the way that I did.

39:19.313 --> 39:21.359
And...

39:21.402 --> 39:23.186
you were right.

39:23.230 --> 39:26.102
I know.

39:27.930 --> 39:30.324
Try not to fuck this up
again.

39:30.368 --> 39:33.109
We'll see.

39:33.153 --> 39:34.763
Is it cool if I go
grab a drink with Charlie?

39:34.807 --> 39:35.938
Do I have a choice?

39:37.157 --> 39:39.115
No.

39:46.209 --> 39:48.037
She's something else,
that broad, isn't she?

39:48.081 --> 39:50.562
Yes, she is.

39:50.605 --> 39:52.433
It's a good thing
that she did,

39:52.477 --> 39:54.479
going to the boss like that.

39:54.522 --> 39:56.481
She did what?

39:56.524 --> 39:58.308
Oh, yeah.

39:58.352 --> 40:01.268
How do you think
the boss found out?

40:01.311 --> 40:02.878
All right, quiet on set.

40:05.490 --> 40:09.189
Rolling.Sound speed.

40:09.232 --> 40:11.496
Action!

40:14.194 --> 40:17.458
You had a lot of people
nervous, Charlie.

40:17.502 --> 40:19.242
Do I make you nervous?

40:19.286 --> 40:20.853
Me?

40:20.896 --> 40:22.245
Of course not.

40:24.813 --> 40:26.075
So what happened?

40:26.119 --> 40:28.077
The board decided
to keep Paramount?

40:30.297 --> 40:31.646
It was split, six-six.

40:32.778 --> 40:33.866
Ah.

40:33.909 --> 40:36.085
So you decided to keep it.

40:36.129 --> 40:37.260
What swayed you?

40:37.304 --> 40:38.523
Was it Evans?

40:38.566 --> 40:40.742
Ah, that Evans.
He's too emotional.

40:42.527 --> 40:43.571
Why then?

40:43.615 --> 40:45.747
It wasn't personal.

40:45.791 --> 40:46.966
It was business.

40:48.402 --> 40:52.275
Do you know why dogs
show their bellies?

40:52.319 --> 40:54.626
Tummy rubs?It's a sign of submission.

40:54.669 --> 40:58.020
When the other dog sees it,
he knows he holds the power.

40:58.064 --> 41:00.022
In business, you never
want to be a bitch

41:00.066 --> 41:01.371
that shows its belly.

41:01.415 --> 41:03.286
Hmm.

41:03.330 --> 41:04.766
Heard you wanted to see me?

41:07.290 --> 41:08.553
Lapidus told me
to meet you here.

41:08.596 --> 41:09.945
Well, I'm glad
that Wharton fuck

41:09.989 --> 41:12.687
could get one thing right.

41:12.731 --> 41:14.428
You're done, Dunston.

41:14.472 --> 41:16.517
Off the board.
Effective immediately.

41:16.561 --> 41:17.997
What?
You can't do this.

41:18.040 --> 41:20.521
I can.
And I did.

41:20.565 --> 41:22.349
Now get the fuck out of here.

41:28.573 --> 41:29.835
You're out of
your fucking mind,

41:29.878 --> 41:31.401
you crazy Austrian fuck!

41:47.287 --> 41:49.637
Just business, huh?

41:49.681 --> 41:53.119
That fucker questioned
my hold on the company.

41:53.162 --> 41:54.947
Sometimes it is personal.

41:57.906 --> 42:00.039
Get me another glass
of scotch,

42:00.082 --> 42:03.129
you crazy Austrian fuck.

42:07.263 --> 42:09.744
I'm so glad
you could make it.

42:09.788 --> 42:11.572
How was your first day on set?

42:11.616 --> 42:12.791
Really good, yeah.

42:12.834 --> 42:14.488
I can't believe
we're actually filming.

42:16.185 --> 42:17.535
And, Joe,
I can't thank you enough

42:17.578 --> 42:19.145
for everything you did.

42:19.188 --> 42:20.973
Hey, no, forget about it.

42:21.016 --> 42:22.061
We couldn't have done it
without you.

42:22.104 --> 42:23.062
I told you,
we're friends here.

42:23.105 --> 42:24.411
Come here, come here.

42:24.454 --> 42:25.586
All right, come on.

42:25.630 --> 42:27.240
Let's go meet
this fucking joke.

42:30.809 --> 42:34.029
Hey.Joey Colombo, get in here.

42:34.073 --> 42:35.857
Good to see you.

42:35.901 --> 42:37.555
How are you?Good, good.

42:39.382 --> 42:42.124
Come on, let's have a drink.Come on, come on, come on.

43:03.624 --> 43:04.973
Thanks for doing this,
bub.

43:05.017 --> 43:05.974
Ah, it's the least
I could do, Joe.

43:06.018 --> 43:07.236
The League
is very important to me.

43:07.280 --> 43:08.324
Yeah, yeah.

43:08.368 --> 43:09.282
Frank, I want to introduce you

43:09.325 --> 43:10.544
to my friend Al Ruddy.

43:10.588 --> 43:12.198
He's the producer
I was telling you about.

43:12.241 --> 43:13.416
How are you?

43:13.460 --> 43:14.809
Wait.

43:14.853 --> 43:16.768
Do I know you from somewhere?

43:16.811 --> 43:18.073
Not officially.

43:18.117 --> 43:20.554
Big fan.Ah, I appreciate that, kid.

43:20.598 --> 43:21.860
Sit down, gents.

43:24.950 --> 43:26.691
Wait a second.
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

43:29.694 --> 43:30.999
You're the guy who straightened
out the script, right?

43:31.043 --> 43:32.305
That's right, that's right.

43:32.348 --> 43:33.959
I just do whatever
my friend Joe asks.

43:35.264 --> 43:37.658
Smart man.Right?

43:37.702 --> 43:38.877
Really,

43:38.920 --> 43:40.400
thanks for making it
happen for me.

43:40.443 --> 43:42.445
Not a problem.

44:00.289 --> 44:01.290
What's that mean?

44:14.216 --> 44:17.306
It loosely translates to, uh,

44:17.350 --> 44:19.657
"Those that wish us harm

44:19.700 --> 44:21.310
can go fuck themselves."

44:23.051 --> 44:24.226
Cin cin.

46:11.594 --> 46:14.119
Colombo!
Colombo! Colombo! Colombo!

46:15.250 --> 46:17.644
We have a big problem.Are there any little ones?

46:18.036 --> 46:19.820
He's dead.Jesus.

46:19.864 --> 46:21.735
You're doing great, Joe,
keep it up.

46:21.779 --> 46:24.303
So this is a gangster film?It's more than that.

46:24.346 --> 46:25.391
This movie...

46:25.434 --> 46:26.871
This looks like
a goddamn circus.

46:26.914 --> 46:29.090
...is a mess.So what's our solution?

46:29.743 --> 46:30.962
Find me a better one.

46:31.005 --> 46:32.920
I'm in charge of the horse head?
Fuck.

46:32.964 --> 46:34.356
I'm not cutting the scene!

46:34.400 --> 46:36.445
He has no appreciation
for anyone, and I'm done.

46:36.489 --> 46:37.882
Coppola has lost his crew.

46:37.925 --> 46:39.797
They wanna fire him.What about Ruddy?

46:39.840 --> 46:41.189
I want you out! Now!

46:41.233 --> 46:42.582
You better be ready
to take over.

46:42.887 --> 46:43.801
I need someone I trust.

46:45.150 --> 46:46.194
You have to learn
if you're cut out for this life.

46:46.891 --> 46:48.718
Say the word,
I'm there, buddy.

47:03.211 --> 47:04.430
Let's do it.

47:05.997 --> 47:07.868
Having just worked
with the real Al Pacino,

47:07.912 --> 47:11.393
I spoke with him at great
length about The Godfather.

47:11.437 --> 47:13.526
And this was before
I even realized

47:13.569 --> 47:15.484
I was going to be a
part of this project.

47:15.528 --> 47:18.313
And so when Anthony Ippolito
showed up on set

47:18.357 --> 47:20.838
and I heard his voice,
it was uncanny.

47:20.881 --> 47:23.884
It was like being
with the real Al.

47:23.928 --> 47:25.233
You wanna try one?

47:25.277 --> 47:26.974
Yeah.Let's do it.

47:27.018 --> 47:28.715
There's something
really pure about the fact

47:28.758 --> 47:30.325
that he's just a
guy at this point.

47:30.369 --> 47:31.631
Now he's Al Pacino.

47:31.674 --> 47:33.938
So it's just a privilege
to be able to capture

47:33.981 --> 47:35.548
the beautiful period in time

47:35.591 --> 47:37.855
where he is kind of on
the precipice of greatness.

47:41.771 --> 47:44.818
He told many different
stories about his experience

47:44.862 --> 47:46.907
on The Godfather,
the different battles

47:46.951 --> 47:50.128
that he endured in
playing Michael Corleone.

47:50.171 --> 47:53.087
Al Pacino was almost
fired multiple times.

47:53.131 --> 47:54.654
That is no leading man.

47:54.697 --> 47:56.047
I could definitely identify

47:56.090 --> 47:58.092
with so much
of where he was at at that time.

47:58.136 --> 48:01.748
I definitely understand
the path of being an actor,

48:01.791 --> 48:04.142
or struggling actor
and trying to get work.

48:04.185 --> 48:06.971
Yeah. I'm, I'm just a
little nervous, you know.

48:07.493 --> 48:11.192
To see him completely transform

48:11.236 --> 48:15.109
into Al Pacino,
into Michael Corleone.

48:15.153 --> 48:19.026
his mannerisms, his gait,
the way that he spoke.

48:19.070 --> 48:20.288
That's all I need.

48:20.854 --> 48:22.073
All right.
I could do that.

48:24.075 --> 48:25.728
It was really interesting
and a privilege to be able

48:25.772 --> 48:27.730
to portray him at this
period of time in his life.

48:27.774 --> 48:29.950
I just think that's a
really cool period of time

48:29.994 --> 48:31.038
to tell a story about.

48:32.257 --> 48:33.432
Cut.That's a cut!

48:35.521 --> 48:37.088
I did what I had to do.

48:37.131 --> 48:38.959
So either fire me
or let me get work.

48:39.003 --> 48:41.875
In a way Ruddy has a few
partners making this movie.

48:41.919 --> 48:43.659
He has, obviously, Coppola

48:43.703 --> 48:45.139
and everybody concerned
with the film.

48:45.183 --> 48:46.793
Evans, sometimes unwilling...

48:46.836 --> 48:49.665
You are one crazy motherfucker,
you know that?

48:49.709 --> 48:50.971
But definitely his partner.

48:51.015 --> 48:52.320
I heard about what happened.

48:52.364 --> 48:53.278
Colombo.

48:53.321 --> 48:54.366
It ain't gonna stand.

48:55.715 --> 48:57.021
He would've never got his
permits without Colombo.

48:57.064 --> 48:58.544
Colombo will shut
down production

48:58.587 --> 48:59.458
right on the first day
they were shooting.

48:59.501 --> 49:01.199
No you, no movie.

49:01.242 --> 49:03.984
And Bettye is a big partner.

49:04.028 --> 49:05.246
What are you doing in Brooklyn?

49:06.508 --> 49:07.770
Um...

49:07.814 --> 49:09.990
I think she has the balls,
because she comes

49:10.034 --> 49:12.645
from an honest place,
to go and see someone like...

49:12.688 --> 49:13.602
Mr. Colombo.

49:13.646 --> 49:15.430
You know, walk into a room

49:15.474 --> 49:17.650
where she might never
walk out of.

49:17.693 --> 49:19.565
I just wanted to come
and tell you in person

49:19.608 --> 49:21.654
that Ruddy's been
fired off the movie.

49:22.263 --> 49:24.091
It was a scene I was
actually really nervous about.

49:24.135 --> 49:26.964
And a scene that felt
very kind of meta.

49:27.007 --> 49:28.487
The nerves felt
really good for it.

49:28.530 --> 49:29.705
Is that right?

49:29.749 --> 49:31.055
She's even told to her face

49:31.098 --> 49:33.013
that they've never seen
a woman in there before.

49:33.057 --> 49:34.972
Listen, you got some
stones coming in here.

49:35.973 --> 49:38.453
All my life, I ain't never
seen a broad inside.

49:38.497 --> 49:40.890
You know,
we tried when we were
putting the story together

49:40.934 --> 49:42.762
to think about the backdrop
of America at the time.

49:42.805 --> 49:44.851
We're right in the middle
of the women's lib movement.

49:44.894 --> 49:49.160
And yes, we don't live in
those moments for this show,

49:49.203 --> 49:51.553
but they do play in,
and they are a backdrop.

49:51.597 --> 49:53.251
I'm not trying to make history.

49:53.860 --> 49:56.645
There's this wonderful
moment between Bettye and Puzo.

49:56.689 --> 50:00.040
Puzo says, "You went to
talk to Joe Colombo?"

50:00.084 --> 50:01.955
Even I wouldn't
talk to Joe Colombo.

50:02.434 --> 50:04.001
It's the craziest
thing I ever heard.

50:04.697 --> 50:07.961
You're a little, well,
little kooky in the head.

50:08.527 --> 50:10.355
She has this real
heartfelt moment with him

50:10.398 --> 50:12.009
where she explains
why she did it.

50:12.052 --> 50:14.881
It's some loyalty
you got for Ruddy.

50:15.273 --> 50:16.622
I didn't do it for him.

50:17.014 --> 50:18.058
I did it for me.

50:18.102 --> 50:19.668
It's not just for Ruddy,

50:19.712 --> 50:22.845
it's really about her own needs
and her own wants as a woman.

50:22.889 --> 50:24.064
You did the right thing.

50:26.153 --> 50:27.154
I hope so.

50:29.461 --> 50:31.028
Yeah, she wanted to go
and get Ruddy's job back,
but she wanted to go

50:31.071 --> 50:32.290
and get his job back
because she wants
to keep her job.

50:32.333 --> 50:34.031
It's not just
working for the man,

50:34.074 --> 50:37.077
it's because she also knows
she has a place where she is

50:37.121 --> 50:38.339
and she wants to keep it.

50:38.383 --> 50:40.080
You were right.I know.

50:40.733 --> 50:42.300
I think she does surprise people

50:42.343 --> 50:43.866
and she's more
than meets the eye.

50:44.258 --> 50:47.305
That's why all these
men in this universe

50:47.348 --> 50:48.828
take her seriously, ultimately.

50:48.871 --> 50:50.221
It's a good thing that she did,

50:50.264 --> 50:51.700
going to the boss like that.

50:52.266 --> 50:53.441
She did what?
