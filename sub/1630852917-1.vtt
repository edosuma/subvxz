WEBVTT

00:10.944 --> 00:16.782
JHONNY: I see a dark spot
over there on the far beach, and uh

00:19.686 --> 00:23.222
it's a rock bear.
It's a big ass rock.

00:26.227 --> 00:30.996
That's another rock
bear, no bears.

00:34.368 --> 00:35.901
They eat along the shore.

00:48.582 --> 00:51.917
I'm out here hunting black
bear because black bear

00:52.052 --> 00:54.653
is readily available
in this area.

00:55.256 --> 00:58.123
Springtime is when they
come out of the den,

00:58.258 --> 01:00.859
and black bear's what's
going to feed me,

01:00.928 --> 01:06.865
feed my dog, carry us through the
few months that we stay in this area.

01:08.402 --> 01:12.070
Once that bear's gone it'll
be time to go back north

01:12.139 --> 01:14.339
and start chasing caribou,

01:14.475 --> 01:17.793
but every area has
its own resource.

01:17.945 --> 01:20.179
And I take advantage
of those resources.

01:24.819 --> 01:30.422
My method is to invest a
day understanding the land.

01:30.491 --> 01:32.491
You know, understanding the
land, understanding the area

01:32.560 --> 01:35.894
helps me understand the animal.

01:36.029 --> 01:37.596
If I was a bear
where would I be?

01:41.568 --> 01:43.335
Different world through these.

01:45.439 --> 01:47.673
I think you're actually
looking through them.

02:02.923 --> 02:05.390
Bears like to come
out of the trees,

02:05.459 --> 02:07.826
and they come and they eat
this grass right here.

02:09.530 --> 02:11.663
Ooh. Look at
this, Java.

02:11.798 --> 02:14.933
Something's been in
here just grazing,

02:15.068 --> 02:17.970
and that something is what
I'm after and that's black bear.

02:20.007 --> 02:21.406
This is good sign.

02:24.278 --> 02:25.878
A jackpot up here.

02:26.814 --> 02:29.448
Come here. Fish bones.

02:32.353 --> 02:35.420
What the bears do is
they'll fish in the rivers

02:35.489 --> 02:37.822
and the creeks and
once they get a fish,

02:37.892 --> 02:41.627
they'll climb up somewhere
so they can be alone and eat it,

02:41.762 --> 02:43.629
otherwise other bears
will try to compete,

02:43.764 --> 02:46.365
and they'll try to take
that salmon from them.

02:48.169 --> 02:50.435
They're eating the grass;
they're eating the fish.

02:50.571 --> 02:53.272
I mean the bears are not
going to be far from this area.

02:56.577 --> 02:59.778
I've lived all over
the United States.

02:59.913 --> 03:05.717
The last place I was living in
before I got to Alaska was Seattle.

03:05.852 --> 03:10.389
Living in a town and living
in a city is not healthy for me.

03:10.524 --> 03:13.592
It's like a disease to my soul.

03:13.727 --> 03:15.460
This is where I belong.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.799
That's the lucky one, Java.

03:20.934 --> 03:25.938
This right here, it'll bring
home spring and summer meat.

03:26.073 --> 03:27.873
What do you think, rub
some good luck on ya?

03:30.611 --> 03:33.078
There we go.

03:33.213 --> 03:36.348
Alaska's not a land
of what-ifs for me.

03:36.483 --> 03:41.486
To be worrying about what if I
don't do this or what if I don't do that

03:41.622 --> 03:43.088
is an unhealthy way
to live out here.

03:43.157 --> 03:46.558
It's a way that I just,
I don't live out here,

03:46.693 --> 03:48.694
I don't think like
that whatsoever.

03:55.168 --> 03:56.768
I can see a black
bear right now.

03:59.306 --> 04:02.007
The wind is blowing right toward that
and it's going to smell me in no time.

04:06.313 --> 04:11.183
That's exactly where the
bear's at so it's gonna smell us

04:11.318 --> 04:15.220
and it's probably six hundred yards away and
I gotta get at least to two-hundred yards.

04:25.866 --> 04:28.033
There's two of them,
there's two bears.

04:29.202 --> 04:30.202
They're looking at me.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.842
It's a sow with two cubs.
I can't shoot that bear.

04:40.347 --> 04:42.013
I don't wanna shoot it
because it's a mom,

04:42.082 --> 04:44.282
I don't want to shoot
it because it has cubs,

04:44.351 --> 04:47.152
and I don't wanna shoot
it because a sow bear

04:47.221 --> 04:50.088
is one of the most
dangerous bears to approach.

04:50.157 --> 04:52.624
It's going to do everything
it can to protect its cubs.

04:54.628 --> 04:57.396
You don't wanna mess with
mama bear, she'll mess you up.

04:58.299 --> 05:00.299
She's a good size, too.

05:04.771 --> 05:07.839
KALEB: As a young-adult,
I lived in the city.

05:07.908 --> 05:10.142
On a low-paying job.

05:11.045 --> 05:12.611
That was getting me nowhere.

05:13.714 --> 05:15.180
I grew up in this valley.

05:15.315 --> 05:20.852
And I saw an opportunity here to
make a better living for my family,

05:20.921 --> 05:26.458
and if I don't I'm one
step closer to failure.

05:29.196 --> 05:30.329
All right, Gilbert.

05:30.464 --> 05:35.467
We got our trap, some
wire, an axe and a shovel.

05:35.536 --> 05:38.270
I think we'll be able to
take care of these beavers.

05:41.141 --> 05:46.010
Gilbert and I are heading out
to McCarthy's most well used

05:46.080 --> 05:51.616
watering hole to assess
whether beavers have moved in.

05:53.954 --> 06:01.093
Beavers will flood landscapes and
they carry Giardia Bug, beaver fever.

06:01.228 --> 06:03.962
Which makes humans
incredibly sick.

06:04.097 --> 06:05.764
GILBERT: You're
getting caught.

06:05.833 --> 06:07.966
KALEB: All right, Gilbert.

06:08.101 --> 06:10.936
So, we need to make sure that
there's no beavers around here.

06:13.574 --> 06:15.573
Hop on in.

06:15.642 --> 06:19.511
And if there are, we
need to catch them.

06:19.646 --> 06:21.312
You ready to do this?
GILBERT: Yeah.

06:21.382 --> 06:24.449
KALEB: We're gonna go
find us a beaver pond.

06:25.652 --> 06:29.621
Come on! Good girl!

06:31.392 --> 06:35.193
You gotta be careful here
so we don't tip over.

06:35.328 --> 06:43.328
I see lots of really old cuttings
here but nothing fresh, which is good.

06:43.871 --> 06:48.940
This is my chance to teach
Gilbert about conservation.

06:49.009 --> 06:51.543
Just let the wind carry us, Gil.

06:51.628 --> 06:56.881
Dealing with animals that can threaten
the health of an entire community.

06:56.950 --> 07:03.688
We're gonna just kinda
ease our way in here.

07:03.757 --> 07:08.827
Whoo! Go straight
off the bow.

07:10.697 --> 07:12.297
Hi, Pipe.

07:13.700 --> 07:18.036
You can grab this, we're gonna
try and catch a beaver with that.

07:18.171 --> 07:24.576
We'll get the wire, here you go, and
axe and we're gonna set up this house.

07:24.645 --> 07:28.113
So, let's see what
we can find here.

07:32.385 --> 07:35.854
CHEVIE: I live here with
my wife and three kids.

07:35.989 --> 07:38.757
Sonta's from here. Deg
Hit'an Athabascan.

07:41.194 --> 07:44.196
As long as we have
respect for the land.

07:44.331 --> 07:49.667
And appreciate the land,
we'll reap that reward

07:49.736 --> 07:51.636
that the land will
give back to us.

07:53.540 --> 07:55.674
SONTA: Let's do this thing,
let's get some white fish.

07:56.944 --> 07:59.744
We are hungry.
CHEVIE: Hungry.

07:59.813 --> 08:02.414
SONTA: Kay, everyone has
their life jackets on?

08:02.549 --> 08:05.550
CHEVIE: Right now, this is
one of my favorite times of year.

08:05.685 --> 08:08.086
As soon as the ice goes
out of the Innoko River

08:08.221 --> 08:10.689
the white fish start
running. SONTA: Thank you.

08:10.824 --> 08:15.426
CHEVIE: And we have about ten
days to capitalize on catching them.

08:15.496 --> 08:16.628
We might be shooting
the shotgun too

08:16.697 --> 08:19.364
so you guys look out
for ducks, okay?

08:19.433 --> 08:21.233
You guys might have to grab
them out of the water, all right?

08:24.238 --> 08:28.039
SONTA: Our first
ride of the year.

08:28.108 --> 08:33.444
Our diet is really based on the
seasons. You good? SYDNEY: Yeah.

08:33.514 --> 08:35.580
SONTA: So, while we're
looking for white fish

08:35.715 --> 08:37.649
we're looking for
other things as well.

08:38.785 --> 08:41.052
We just gotta be
ready and prepared.

08:42.322 --> 08:47.192
I'm pregnant right now, and it might
not look like the most comfortable thing.

08:47.327 --> 08:48.860
CHEVIE: You guys good?

08:48.929 --> 08:52.197
SONTA: But, really I know that
this is a healthy activity for me

08:52.332 --> 08:55.033
and baby's gonna eat
some good whitefish.

08:56.202 --> 08:57.302
Are you staying warm enough?

09:15.422 --> 09:17.222
RYDER: Do I go grab it?
CHEVIE: Yeah, go ahead.

09:18.292 --> 09:20.225
SYDNEY: I want to
try and grab it, too.

09:20.360 --> 09:24.296
CHEVIE: Ryder's gonna grab it.
You get the next one.

09:24.431 --> 09:26.264
Don't lean over
the edge too far.

09:28.101 --> 09:31.169
When we're out doing
anything, especially on the river

09:31.304 --> 09:34.973
it does add another
level of danger

09:35.108 --> 09:37.842
but there's a lot of opportunities
that may present themselves.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.611
So, we have to be
able to capitalize.

09:41.381 --> 09:42.914
EMRY: We got it.
SONTA: Yup.

09:45.452 --> 09:47.919
CHEVIE: Sydney,
Sydney here.

09:47.988 --> 09:50.722
Push off of it up
there so we can go.

10:00.200 --> 10:04.603
JESSI: We live out here in
the middle of nowhere, Alaska.

10:04.738 --> 10:08.740
Originally, we came out here because
Chris' dad's homestead was here.

10:08.875 --> 10:11.943
And then we started feeling
what it is to be out here.

10:12.078 --> 10:15.947
And I'm hoping that our
sweat, and our tears,

10:16.016 --> 10:19.851
and just our body-aches will
continue to keep this thing standing.

10:21.955 --> 10:25.023
CHRIS: It's amazing that the
windstorm took this tree down.

10:25.092 --> 10:28.426
There's some funky
trees around the house.

10:28.495 --> 10:30.362
JESSI: Ready?
CHRIS: Yeah.

10:30.497 --> 10:31.896
JESSI: I'll follow you.

10:32.899 --> 10:37.302
CHRIS: I'd hate for a big
tree to fall right on the roof.

10:37.437 --> 10:42.707
So, this is one of the trees that
I've been very worried about is this.

10:42.842 --> 10:46.978
I noticed this started cracking in
the last few days, and it is just like.

10:47.113 --> 10:49.113
JESSI: Well, look at
it just sway up there.

10:49.182 --> 10:53.184
CHRIS: Yeah, and if you notice
it's leaning out over the cabin.

10:53.319 --> 10:54.786
We've gotta take
these trees down.

10:54.921 --> 10:56.254
If we don't.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.523
JESSI: We better take them
down before they take the.

10:58.592 --> 10:59.991
CHRIS: Cabin down.
JESSI: Cabin down.

11:00.060 --> 11:04.729
CHRIS: This isn't even the worst
tree, check this tree out over here.

11:04.864 --> 11:06.664
It's gotta come
down at any point.

11:06.733 --> 11:09.401
JESSI: Yikes, they're
both equally rotten.

11:09.536 --> 11:11.669
CHRIS: Yeah, and unfortunately
the worst time to cut trees

11:11.722 --> 11:14.205
is when it's super windy.

11:14.274 --> 11:17.809
JESSI: So, we're gonna have to
rip these things with a come along.

11:17.878 --> 11:20.378
CHRIS: Yeah. That's how I'm
feeling. JESSI: Sounds good.

11:22.015 --> 11:25.450
CHRIS: I just need something
kind of heavy, something like this.

11:28.421 --> 11:31.556
The idea's to, like, chuck
something like hook it on a rope

11:31.625 --> 11:34.158
and like chuck it
up to the tree.

11:34.227 --> 11:37.962
Try to rope a come along to it
and pull it but let me just try it out.

11:41.301 --> 11:42.834
JESSI: What.

11:42.903 --> 11:45.704
CHRIS: Like that.
(laughs)

11:45.839 --> 11:47.305
Dude it's wedged in there.

11:47.374 --> 11:50.308
JESSI: You think that's gonna
apply enough pressure to pull it?

11:50.443 --> 11:54.445
CHRIS: Well, that wasn't
the plan but let's just see.

11:54.514 --> 11:56.247
Son of a gun.

11:56.382 --> 12:01.052
JESSI: Yeah but what happens when you apply
enough pressure to break that one branch?

12:01.187 --> 12:04.055
CHRIS: Um, just humor me.
JESSI: Okay.

12:04.190 --> 12:05.590
CHRIS: Just humor
me for a moment.

12:05.725 --> 12:06.958
JESSI: All right. CHRIS:
I wanna try something.

12:10.530 --> 12:13.531
You see that?
JESSI: I don't even wanna be.

12:16.002 --> 12:18.603
CHRIS: Oh, you see
that tree move?

12:18.738 --> 12:21.940
I don't think
anything's gonna break.

12:22.025 --> 12:23.775
Watch that tree.

12:30.367 --> 12:33.634
Gonna pull it one more time
and see if it'll move a bit more.

12:33.703 --> 12:38.372
JESSI: Oh my gosh. You okay?
CHRIS: Oh, yeah. JESSI: Yeah.

12:38.442 --> 12:40.174
CHRIS: It got me in the
shin, you can see where

12:40.243 --> 12:42.644
it nailed me when it
came out of the tree.

12:42.779 --> 12:45.647
I think I got a little excited
that it went up on first try.

12:45.782 --> 12:47.182
I'd like to get it all
the way up and over

12:47.317 --> 12:52.220
and then get this rope hooked
to like a cable. So, let's try again.

12:59.195 --> 13:01.029
Nope, close.

13:02.666 --> 13:04.132
Better than climbing the tree.

13:06.736 --> 13:07.969
Let me try one more time.

13:09.205 --> 13:11.739
JESSI: Just be careful
when that comes down.

13:11.875 --> 13:15.610
CHRIS: There it is,
come on. Ah!

13:15.679 --> 13:20.548
JESSI: Whoa! It's like
going to the carnival.

13:20.683 --> 13:23.651
CHRIS: Okay, let's
try something else.

13:24.621 --> 13:26.955
We're just, we're just trying.

13:31.094 --> 13:33.128
I don't know if I can
poke it with this or not.

13:34.898 --> 13:37.765
JESSI: Oh, wow. Can you
reach it all the way up there?

13:37.901 --> 13:39.100
CHRIS: I can't see yet.

13:42.639 --> 13:43.838
Right there.

13:45.708 --> 13:47.208
JESSI: Great.
CHRIS: Got it.

13:49.312 --> 13:51.980
JESSI: Here it is.
I've got it.

13:52.115 --> 13:56.918
CHRIS: All right, so we just need to get
this untied and then hooked to the cable.

13:57.053 --> 13:58.286
JESSI: Okay.

14:02.993 --> 14:05.994
KALEB: People in the city
have no idea what it's like to

14:06.129 --> 14:10.598
be reliant on a stream to
get their daily drinking water.

14:10.667 --> 14:15.536
They never have to think about
where does this water come from?

14:15.605 --> 14:17.272
Is it safe to drink?

14:17.407 --> 14:19.641
And will there be
water tomorrow?

14:21.678 --> 14:26.681
I located one of the entrances to
his den, but so far, I'm really happy.

14:26.750 --> 14:29.350
I've not seen any beaver sign.

14:29.419 --> 14:31.752
That's good, we don't want
beavers in this pond,

14:31.821 --> 14:35.156
but we still need to make sure
we make the effort to catch one

14:35.225 --> 14:38.693
if he's sneaking and
hiding in here. 'kay?

14:38.762 --> 14:40.562
GILBERT: Or we
could dig in this.

14:40.697 --> 14:45.166
KALEB: We're not allowed to
touch the, the den. GILBERT: Why?

14:45.235 --> 14:47.969
KALEB: Because Alaska law
does not allow that. GILBERT: Ah.

14:48.104 --> 14:51.506
KALEB: Ah. Let's find two long
skinny poles. GILBERT: 'Kay.

14:51.641 --> 14:52.907
KALEB: Like this
one right here.

14:53.042 --> 14:55.910
I think this one might be
long enough. Oh, yeah.

14:59.382 --> 15:03.251
Ooh, look at this pole
right here. See that?

15:03.320 --> 15:06.321
A beaver cut that down, and
he tried to cut it right there.

15:06.456 --> 15:09.857
Look at that, his teeth
are just like, hummm.

15:09.993 --> 15:12.594
All right, have you ever seen
how to set one of these, Gil?

15:12.729 --> 15:13.928
It's pretty easy.

15:14.063 --> 15:15.863
GILBERT: But it also look
dangerous.

15:15.932 --> 15:18.533
KALEB: These are very
dangerous.

15:18.668 --> 15:21.536
The first year that the
beavers were in this pond

15:21.671 --> 15:25.873
I caught one in a conibear like
this and one in a foothold trap.

15:25.942 --> 15:32.280
And then the next spring, two
more beavers moved into the house,

15:32.415 --> 15:35.750
and I got them with my rifle.

15:35.819 --> 15:38.820
So, I've taken four
beavers out of this house,

15:38.955 --> 15:44.125
and I've done my part to help keep
our community drinking water safe.

15:48.097 --> 15:54.969
Beavers have underwater entrances
and when they come out of the house,

15:55.104 --> 15:56.904
they swim out really fast.

15:57.040 --> 16:02.643
So, when they hit the trigger of
the conibear there's not backing out.

16:02.712 --> 16:04.979
And we caught a beaver.

16:05.114 --> 16:07.782
I mean a beaver chew.

16:07.917 --> 16:11.052
Now we just need to disassemble
this and put it in the water.

16:11.121 --> 16:12.520
GILBERT: Mhm.

16:12.589 --> 16:15.857
KALEB: We don't like having
beavers in our drinking water, right?

16:15.992 --> 16:18.125
GILBERT: Right.

16:18.194 --> 16:24.065
KALEB: Kaboom. I think
we're good to go.

16:24.200 --> 16:26.334
Let's tear out some
beaver dam, Gilbert.

16:33.743 --> 16:36.144
JHONNY: Hunting's more than
just pulling a trigger.

16:36.279 --> 16:40.014
Hunting is having a deeper
connection with my food

16:40.149 --> 16:42.216
and a better understanding
of nature.

16:42.352 --> 16:47.055
And no other lifestyle I've lived
has allowed me to do just that.

16:53.629 --> 16:55.229
I see a bear on the shore.

16:56.566 --> 16:59.033
It can be kind of hard
to tell from afar

16:59.168 --> 17:01.002
because he's kind of
up in the brush.

17:03.639 --> 17:08.909
It's gotta suck trying to keep
a quiet, steady movement.

17:08.978 --> 17:11.179
I'm trying to race up
to catch this bear,

17:11.314 --> 17:13.414
I'm also trying not to scare it.

17:17.854 --> 17:21.389
Once he goes up into
that brush he's gone,

17:21.458 --> 17:23.724
but the wind's in my favor.

17:23.793 --> 17:29.330
Wind's blowing opposite which'll
help try to carry this noise of my

17:29.465 --> 17:33.634
upward motor away from the bear,
keep my scent away from the bear.

17:34.937 --> 17:38.406
It's just so hard to
put a sneak on 'em.

17:40.076 --> 17:42.009
But you better believe
I'm gonna try it.

17:44.213 --> 17:50.284
To get an entire bear that's going
to feed me for about two months.

17:50.420 --> 17:52.086
That's the best way
to live out here,

17:52.155 --> 17:54.389
'cause hand and mouth
is a lot harder.

17:57.693 --> 17:58.393
That's a big bear.

18:13.643 --> 18:14.575
Don't go, buddy. Don't go.

18:21.851 --> 18:23.151
Gah, that's a big bear.

18:30.726 --> 18:32.293
Two-hundred and
twenty-five yards.

18:36.399 --> 18:40.268
Hey, hey. No.

18:40.403 --> 18:42.336
There's a seal right over
there and she's curious

18:42.472 --> 18:44.639
when she sees little
critters in the water.

19:15.354 --> 19:16.554
JHONNY: I'm moving
way too much,

19:16.623 --> 19:18.689
there's no way I'll
make this shot.

19:20.426 --> 19:26.230
I would rather not take
a shot than miss a shot

19:26.299 --> 19:29.433
or even worse injure the
bear. That's not what I'm about,

19:29.502 --> 19:31.835
so I think what I need
to do is go to shore.

19:31.905 --> 19:35.773
If I skirt around it, I think I can
kind of get a stalk up behind it.

19:38.711 --> 19:41.445
Java, you got your ears on?

19:42.582 --> 19:44.315
Are we listening?

19:44.450 --> 19:46.517
We paying attention?

19:46.586 --> 19:48.452
If we go to shore,
you gotta behave.

19:51.257 --> 19:53.124
You'll ruin the hunt,
you'll ruin yourself.

20:22.155 --> 20:24.689
Java girl, come on.
Come on.

20:39.972 --> 20:40.938
(inaudible)

20:54.787 --> 20:56.287
We must have spooked him.

20:57.790 --> 20:59.657
He must have heard me coming.

21:00.926 --> 21:03.794
Pretty hard not to hear
me coming honestly.

21:03.863 --> 21:05.196
It's a tough stalk.

21:09.602 --> 21:13.037
There's a chance that the bear is
on the other side of this big rock.

21:16.542 --> 21:19.210
I don't wanna come up on
a bear like that. That's just,

21:19.345 --> 21:22.546
that's a suicide note.

21:22.682 --> 21:26.050
So, I think it's back
to the boat for now.

21:30.156 --> 21:31.522
JESSI: Nature is everything.

21:33.443 --> 21:36.160
It is the force of life up here,

21:36.229 --> 21:38.896
and it's stronger
than I will ever be.

21:39.031 --> 21:42.600
You can resist but you
can't push it too far.

21:45.038 --> 21:48.972
CHRIS: Damn, it's
windy out today.

21:49.042 --> 21:52.643
Okay. You ready?
JESSI: I hope so.

21:52.712 --> 21:54.011
CHRIS: All right.

22:02.254 --> 22:03.987
Just trying to figure out
how to get a good whip,

22:04.057 --> 22:06.757
the rope is catching and like
slowing it down. JESSI: Yup.

22:10.930 --> 22:12.196
Success!

22:12.331 --> 22:15.666
Chris and I, we have
two large birch trees,

22:15.801 --> 22:18.602
and they have super
rotten cores,

22:18.671 --> 22:20.871
and we have to
take 'em down now.

22:20.940 --> 22:23.808
CHRIS: Yeah.
Tighten it up!

22:23.943 --> 22:25.343
JESSI: They're really
close to the house,

22:25.478 --> 22:28.813
these trees literally
can come down tonight.

22:28.948 --> 22:33.017
CHRIS: Nice. Start
putting pressure on it.

22:33.152 --> 22:36.954
Go until it's like,
zip line tight.

22:37.023 --> 22:41.091
There it goes.
Pulling good.

22:41.160 --> 22:45.496
It's starting to pull
away from the cabin.

22:45.565 --> 22:48.099
JESSI: It's getting
there; it's pretty stiff.

22:48.234 --> 22:49.734
CHRIS: Okay, I'm
gonna make some cuts.

22:56.976 --> 22:58.442
JESSI: Oh, wow.

23:02.048 --> 23:03.848
CHRIS: Starting to move.

23:04.583 --> 23:06.784
Whew! It's cracking!

23:10.056 --> 23:13.657
Just keep pulling until it gets
really tight, it's gonna pull over!

23:14.794 --> 23:18.996
There it is! Just bounce on that
cable and it will come right down.

23:19.131 --> 23:20.331
It's gonna go!

23:22.068 --> 23:24.735
I'm gonna cut it,
make sure it's tight!

23:33.212 --> 23:34.412
All right!

23:34.547 --> 23:37.681
JESSI: That's fantastic,
nothing got destroyed!

23:37.750 --> 23:40.617
CHRIS: Let's start prepping
for the next tree. JESSI: Yeah,

23:40.686 --> 23:42.186
it's gonna be a hard one.

23:44.757 --> 23:46.557
SONTA: You're always gonna
get taught a new lesson.

23:48.361 --> 23:50.361
When you're interacting
with animals,

23:52.899 --> 23:55.065
you're always gonna
get humbled by them.

23:58.905 --> 24:00.171
They're gonna put
you in your place.

24:00.306 --> 24:02.173
They're gonna teach you
something you didn't know before.

24:04.577 --> 24:07.111
Rubbing right up against here?

24:07.246 --> 24:08.846
CHEVIE: That steep
little bank right there?

24:08.981 --> 24:11.515
SONTA: Yeah. It looks like
there's kind of a little eddy in there,

24:11.584 --> 24:13.517
what do you think?
CHEVIE: Yeah.

24:16.255 --> 24:19.023
SONTA: This is an extremely
short window. CHEVIE: Hold on.

24:20.526 --> 24:23.861
SONTA: Oh. For us to be
able to get our spring whitefish.

24:23.930 --> 24:27.598
Because once they're
passed, it's out for the year.

24:28.667 --> 24:30.334
No going near the bank.

24:30.403 --> 24:33.337
You see how it falls so
easily into the river?

24:33.406 --> 24:36.791
CHEVIE: It's deep, too.
That's six to eight feet deep.

24:37.543 --> 24:39.810
SONTA: We'll see
what we see.

24:39.879 --> 24:44.081
Got a little blood on the
dip net, that's a good sign.

24:44.216 --> 24:45.416
SYDNEY: That's
'cause of the duck.

24:45.551 --> 24:47.618
(laughs)

24:47.753 --> 24:50.687
SONTA: The whitefish
are coming up,

24:50.756 --> 24:56.894
so we're facing in an eddy that
allows the fish to come into the net. Oh.

24:56.963 --> 24:57.895
CHEVIE: You felt
something already?

24:58.030 --> 25:00.430
SONTA: Felt
something already.

25:00.500 --> 25:02.833
So that's definitely
a good sign.

25:03.903 --> 25:06.370
CHEVIE: This is what it's all about is
getting on the water in the spring time,

25:06.505 --> 25:12.176
taking advantage of those things. Look
there's some nice animal tracks right there.

25:12.311 --> 25:16.847
That's probably a big black because
you don't see any nails in the sand.

25:16.916 --> 25:18.849
Brown have such long nails
you'll see those nails,

25:18.984 --> 25:21.385
they're very predominant.

25:21.454 --> 25:24.188
They're here looking for food
also so we start cooking fish,

25:24.323 --> 25:27.391
it increases the odds of seeing
one, but, uh, we gotta eat too,

25:27.460 --> 25:30.594
so we just gotta be on our
toes and keep the kids close.

25:30.729 --> 25:34.131
Just one of those, one
of those risks that we take.

25:34.266 --> 25:36.400
SONTA: Oh, that was
something. Let's hope.

25:41.891 --> 25:44.558
Y.
SYDNEY: Oh yay, we got one!

25:44.627 --> 25:46.960
SONTA: Wee! CHEVIE:
We're fishing now. SONTA: Yup.

25:47.029 --> 25:49.296
CHEVIE: I hope you flip it.
SONTA: Thanks.

25:49.365 --> 25:51.365
CHEVIE: How's that frame feel?
SONTA: Great.

25:53.435 --> 25:58.172
- That's a nice big fish.
- That's a big size. - Cool.

25:58.307 --> 25:59.607
SONTA: Pressure.

26:04.446 --> 26:07.815
Woo-hoo! Yes.
CHEVIE: Big fish. Big fish.

26:11.186 --> 26:13.454
SONTA: You know the goal
is really, to get, like,

26:13.589 --> 26:16.190
forty to fifty would be
awesome but if you get, ya know.

26:16.325 --> 26:17.591
CHEVIE: Holy.

26:17.660 --> 26:21.328
SONTA: Ten a day or more,
that's a good start for fishing.

26:23.065 --> 26:26.934
You know, every Innoko
River person is either out here

26:27.069 --> 26:31.705
or waiting for the fish in town. So,
everyone's kinda waiting on the white fish.

26:33.342 --> 26:36.143
One of the things that's really
important is just continuing with our

26:36.278 --> 26:44.278
cultural traditions, the activities that
make us who we are: Innoko River people.

26:44.753 --> 26:46.353
SYDNEY: This feels heavier.

26:46.422 --> 26:48.689
SONTA: This is
essential knowledge.

26:48.758 --> 26:50.758
You got something. SYDNEY: I
got something. I got something.

26:50.893 --> 26:53.694
SONTA: Wow. Something
that you pass on to your kids.

26:53.829 --> 26:56.463
Can you pull it all the way
over? SYDNEY: I think I can!

26:57.433 --> 27:00.634
SONTA: Wow, you picked
a good spot, Sydney.

27:00.703 --> 27:02.469
SYDNEY: Don't take
my spot, mother.

27:11.447 --> 27:14.781
KALEB: There's an animal
control specialist

27:14.850 --> 27:17.284
who takes care of problems
like this in the city.

27:18.187 --> 27:20.921
I don't have that option.

27:21.056 --> 27:23.590
I am the animal
control specialist.

27:24.927 --> 27:27.327
Oh yeah, look at that one.

27:27.396 --> 27:30.397
That's holding back some water.

27:30.532 --> 27:34.001
You have to take beaver dams the
exact same way they went together:

27:34.070 --> 27:36.269
one piece at a time.

27:36.339 --> 27:39.640
Try and do it more than
that, you will not succeed.

27:40.543 --> 27:43.043
Beavers are such
incredible engineers.

27:45.681 --> 27:50.550
You're looking like a foreman
and less like a worker there, Gilbert.

27:50.619 --> 27:54.488
Gilbert, he's not much help with
this dam removal, but that's okay.

27:54.557 --> 27:58.559
He's learning an
important lesson about

27:58.694 --> 28:01.628
taking care of the
resources that are given to us

28:01.764 --> 28:03.964
and being good
stewards of the land.

28:05.501 --> 28:11.571
This dam starts back behind that big
spruce tree and goes all the way here,

28:11.640 --> 28:17.244
all the way down a hundred feet that
way and then crosses another little ways.

28:17.313 --> 28:21.048
But we're trying to make this as
inhospitable as possible for beavers,

28:21.183 --> 28:23.283
so they don't
wanna stick around.

28:24.854 --> 28:26.587
Before we did all this work

28:26.722 --> 28:29.990
this would've been a pretty
sweet place for a beaver to move in.

28:30.059 --> 28:36.129
Unpack their bags, and, uh, enjoy a
nice summer without a whole lotta work,

28:36.198 --> 28:38.665
but we're trying to make
it so they have to build

28:38.801 --> 28:40.133
a lot of infrastructure
to move in here.

28:40.202 --> 28:42.736
GILBERT: They don't have
a bag.

28:42.805 --> 28:44.138
KALEB: It's metaphorical,
Gilbert.

28:49.945 --> 28:53.347
JHONNY: I grew up as a bum,
you know, bumming around.

28:53.482 --> 28:57.017
To just live a stagnate
life doesn't work for me.

28:58.287 --> 29:01.688
The closer I am to
excitement, danger, thrills,

29:01.774 --> 29:03.891
and death, the more
I feel alive.

29:11.166 --> 29:13.400
You ready, Java? Huh?

29:16.505 --> 29:17.738
Buckle in.

29:23.178 --> 29:25.979
I've seen bears on this shore.

29:26.048 --> 29:28.181
Stalked one last night.

29:28.250 --> 29:31.919
It ran up into the trees,
into the bushes. Got lost.

29:32.054 --> 29:35.722
Wasn't able to find it, but
I've seen activity in this area.

29:35.791 --> 29:41.195
I'm gonna kinda focus,
concentrate my time right in here.

30:12.361 --> 30:15.262
All right Java, I see a bear.

30:21.370 --> 30:23.237
It's a bear. I got a bear.

30:25.574 --> 30:28.308
You stay, Java. Stay.

30:38.387 --> 30:41.054
Ears on. You gonna
listen? Huh?

30:41.190 --> 30:46.059
You gonna behave? Really
easy, okay? Let's go.

30:49.731 --> 30:53.267
You gotta go around this
corner and put the stalk on.

30:57.873 --> 31:00.607
(bleep). Slippery.

31:13.488 --> 31:14.855
Oh, yeah, he's feeding.

31:16.291 --> 31:19.059
He's eating a bunch of
grass right now, feeding.

31:20.562 --> 31:21.795
It's kinda sat down.

31:24.099 --> 31:25.832
That thing is (bleep) big.
It's a big bear.

31:29.572 --> 31:30.904
Good girl. Good girl.

31:31.907 --> 31:34.308
Do you remember when I
rubbed this bullet on your face?

31:40.649 --> 31:42.082
That was a good look, wasn't it?

31:43.652 --> 31:46.053
Whoa, that's a big bear.

31:47.923 --> 31:49.623
(sighs)

31:53.929 --> 31:56.029
Easy, easy Java. Easy.

32:01.937 --> 32:05.672
When hunting predators,
especially when I have Java with me.

32:05.741 --> 32:08.408
Hey, hey, Java. Easy.

32:08.543 --> 32:12.479
It's important I take the bear
down with one clean shot.

32:27.563 --> 32:30.797
I gotta wait for it to turn
sideways so I can get a clean shot.

32:37.706 --> 32:37.938
(gunfire)

32:58.777 --> 32:59.743
JHONNY: I think I
got a down bear.

33:13.458 --> 33:14.157
Wow.

33:19.064 --> 33:20.397
Java, come here.

33:21.333 --> 33:23.066
That's a good
girl. Huh?

33:23.135 --> 33:25.668
That's a good girl.
You did so good.

33:25.738 --> 33:27.204
Yeah, I know you smell it.

33:27.339 --> 33:28.538
The wind's blowing
right toward us.

33:31.810 --> 33:38.548
He looks good as dead, but we'll
just have to go over there and find out.

33:38.683 --> 33:40.017
This isn't a caribou.

33:41.686 --> 33:42.753
Come on girl.

33:50.429 --> 33:53.663
Yeah, looking pretty
dead from here.

34:01.506 --> 34:04.775
Yeah. It's dead.

34:07.579 --> 34:10.814
Watch out, Java. Watch out.
Come on. Java, watch out.

34:15.054 --> 34:16.453
Hey, stay back.

34:17.189 --> 34:19.990
Look at those, those teeth.

34:20.125 --> 34:21.525
Something you don't
want coming at you.

34:27.800 --> 34:31.601
Bears and I are both
opportunistic hunters.

34:31.670 --> 34:35.372
We both like to wander. We
both like to be alone.

34:37.142 --> 34:39.609
I see a lot of myself in bears,

34:39.744 --> 34:43.013
but that doesn't exclude
me from being a hunter.

34:43.148 --> 34:48.085
The middle of nowhere in Alaska, next
to a bear that's gonna feed Java and I

34:48.220 --> 34:51.955
for spring into summer.

34:52.090 --> 34:55.692
Having a connection to the
food I eat is a big driving force

34:55.827 --> 34:59.229
to why I live this lifestyle,

34:59.364 --> 35:04.901
because every meal I make
now has a story to tell,

35:05.036 --> 35:06.970
and I remember
having this bullet

35:07.105 --> 35:09.439
and I put it on Java's nose.

35:09.508 --> 35:13.443
I kinda rubbed it a
little luck on, on Java,

35:13.578 --> 35:17.180
'cause this is her first
bear hunt, and uh,

35:17.249 --> 35:19.516
here I am holding that
bullet. That's really really cool.

35:24.590 --> 35:26.656
All right Java, you keep your eye
on this. We're gonna hang onto that.

35:26.791 --> 35:30.527
That's kinda a neat souvenir. I feel
like I got my money back with that one.

35:35.400 --> 35:36.566
Big old testicle.

35:40.806 --> 35:42.239
Puts me to shame.

35:47.145 --> 35:51.948
JESSI: I'm a knife out here, and
the Cosna is the sharpening stone,

35:52.083 --> 35:54.484
and I constantly
have to stay sharp,

35:57.222 --> 36:02.158
'cause as soon as I become dull you
know something's gonna come my way

36:02.227 --> 36:03.827
and I won't be able to cut it.

36:09.167 --> 36:11.368
CHRIS: All right, that's looking
pretty good, I'm gonna come down.

36:11.503 --> 36:15.105
JESSI: Okay. I
got the ladder.

36:15.240 --> 36:18.909
CHRIS: So now I'm gonna figure
out how to get this tree down.

36:19.044 --> 36:19.976
JESSI: Welcome
back to earth.

36:20.045 --> 36:22.512
CHRIS: Oh, it feels
good to be down.

36:22.581 --> 36:24.514
JESSI: All right, let's
take this outta here.

36:24.649 --> 36:27.250
CHRIS: This one worries
me so close to the house.

36:27.319 --> 36:28.585
Nice.

36:30.255 --> 36:33.023
Awesome. I'll
get the cable.

36:36.328 --> 36:39.329
JESSI: So, the cable is strung
up from the rotten birch tree.

36:39.464 --> 36:41.664
It's gonna over to
a healthier tree.

36:41.733 --> 36:45.068
CHRIS: Can't wait to get these
trees down and not worry anymore.

36:45.137 --> 36:47.470
JESSI: It's gonna go
down along a pulley.

36:47.606 --> 36:52.342
CHRIS: Okay. Everything
looks really good.

36:52.477 --> 36:57.147
JESSI: It's gonna go to second
pulley connected to another spruce tree.

36:57.282 --> 37:01.884
Okay, there it is. I
think that works, right?

37:01.954 --> 37:05.355
CHRIS: Yeah, it's gonna
come right across here.

37:05.490 --> 37:07.824
JESSI: So, this is
gonna be our weight.

37:07.893 --> 37:09.826
Keep the tension always.
CHRIS: Yeah.

37:09.895 --> 37:13.230
JESSI: Even when the
come-along doesn't pull anymore.

37:13.365 --> 37:14.564
CHRIS: Cool.

37:15.967 --> 37:17.634
JESSI: Chris and I are
gonna use a weight.

37:17.769 --> 37:21.838
When we took the first tree
down, I was acting as that weight,

37:21.973 --> 37:25.775
but in this small area
in front of our house,

37:25.844 --> 37:29.646
there's not a lot of places
to run from that tree.

37:29.781 --> 37:33.883
Every link in this whole
chain is important.

37:35.988 --> 37:37.120
CHRIS: Nice, it's
starting to float.

37:39.858 --> 37:42.025
JESSI: This is nice and tight.
CHRIS: Cool.

37:43.528 --> 37:46.496
JESSI: Nothing can loosen.
All right, here we go.

37:53.138 --> 37:54.371
CHRIS: Take it slow.

37:55.741 --> 37:57.474
All right, the
barrel's going up.

37:57.609 --> 37:59.442
JESSI: Tell me when you
see the tree moving.

38:03.015 --> 38:04.714
CHRIS: Dang, that barrel's
getting up there.

38:06.418 --> 38:09.352
Okay, it's starting
to crack up top.

38:09.421 --> 38:11.421
JESSI: Keep going?
CHRIS: Naw, that's it.

38:11.490 --> 38:12.689
She's ready to come down.

38:20.165 --> 38:21.331
Here it goes!

38:27.055 --> 38:29.055
JESSI: Oh, the barrel's
coming down. Watch out.

38:31.059 --> 38:32.192
(bleep)

38:33.729 --> 38:34.894
No.

38:40.935 --> 38:48.074
Whoa. CHRIS: (bleep)
yeah! All right! Woo! Yeah!

38:48.143 --> 38:50.076
JESSI: Good job.
CHRIS: Awesome.

38:50.145 --> 38:52.345
JESSI: Woo! That came
down like a big thud, right?

38:52.414 --> 38:54.881
CHRIS: I know, man,
my heart was slamming.

38:54.950 --> 38:55.815
JESSI: We still have
a lot of work to do,

38:55.884 --> 39:01.021
this thing is blocking
everything.

39:01.156 --> 39:03.356
KALEB: Piper, hey. Hold it,
hold it, hold it.

39:03.491 --> 39:07.627
GILBERT: Piper you tip
it over. KALEB: Good dog.

39:07.696 --> 39:10.497
Let's see if we can snake
our way out of these trees.

39:11.232 --> 39:13.199
We got in here somehow.
(laughs)

39:16.038 --> 39:19.039
The dam's torn out, and
we're back in the canoe.

39:19.975 --> 39:22.508
What a nice day on the lake.

39:22.577 --> 39:24.844
You enjoying learning
how to use the canoe?

39:24.979 --> 39:26.713
GILBERT: Yeah.

39:29.384 --> 39:33.186
KALEB: These moments that I
get to spend with Gilbert

39:33.321 --> 39:37.323
are something that can't
be replaced by anything,

39:37.392 --> 39:39.392
and I really hope
that this place sticks

39:39.527 --> 39:42.061
to his soul and he comes back,

39:42.130 --> 39:46.332
uses the resource and
continues this life.

39:46.468 --> 39:48.334
GILBERT: Dad?
KALEB: What?

39:48.403 --> 39:50.937
GILBERT: This is not
a beaver place at all.

39:51.072 --> 39:56.409
KALEB: Uh-huh. I cherish
my moments with Gilbert.

39:56.544 --> 40:00.346
It's time that
I'll never regret.

40:02.751 --> 40:06.686
CHEVIE: We caught somewhere
between fifteen and twenty fish.

40:06.821 --> 40:09.689
That's enough to keep Sonta busy
in the smokehouse for a little while

40:09.824 --> 40:11.491
and give some fish out.

40:11.626 --> 40:17.297
SONTA: Come. So, we have um my tavash and
the one that, who made this for you guys?

40:17.432 --> 40:19.632
RYDER: Grandpa! SONTA:
Grandpa, so hold on.

40:19.701 --> 40:24.904
These are really sharp. What you wanna
do is just hold right here on the gills.

40:24.973 --> 40:28.108
One of the things that's really
important is just showing the kids

40:28.243 --> 40:30.844
how to use these tools.

40:30.979 --> 40:33.646
Wash your hand right
here. To meet our needs.

40:33.715 --> 40:37.049
Here, put this whole thing
like this towards you.

40:37.119 --> 40:39.585
Cultural knowledge is
something that you don't change.

40:39.654 --> 40:41.721
I don't know everything. I
don't claim to know everything.

40:41.856 --> 40:46.259
But, you know, what I
am told, no, other way.

40:46.394 --> 40:47.460
Other way.

40:47.595 --> 40:50.830
I tell it the exact
same way to my kids.

40:50.932 --> 40:51.765
Okay, Emry, go ahead.

41:00.608 --> 41:06.746
JHONNY: I don't have
plans to have children,

41:06.848 --> 41:11.951
but I can see where people
do play a role in my life.

41:12.020 --> 41:14.621
So, right now I'm just
boiling this bear skull.

41:17.292 --> 41:20.093
You know I don't hunt for the
skull, I hunt for the meat,

41:20.228 --> 41:24.497
but to have that skull is just a
way to remember that hunt forever,

41:24.632 --> 41:26.966
keep that animal
alive in spirit.

41:27.101 --> 41:30.570
Okay, this is the hide here.

41:30.705 --> 41:32.972
Just gotta scrape
all the fat off.

41:33.041 --> 41:35.175
That's gonna help me
preserve this hide.

41:35.310 --> 41:38.911
It's not something
I'm gonna just waste.

41:38.980 --> 41:43.183
It was a really, really
successful hunt but it wasn't easy.

41:43.318 --> 41:45.718
And, uh, Java did
an outstanding job.

41:45.787 --> 41:48.655
She just sat right next
to me the whole time,

41:48.790 --> 41:52.124
and, uh, she's pretty tired from
the experience. You can tell,

41:52.194 --> 41:55.094
but we come back
here and we rest up.

41:56.398 --> 41:58.131
I just got a little
bit more work to do.

42:00.468 --> 42:04.270
CHRIS: It's just so much
work, but that's okay.

42:04.339 --> 42:10.276
JESSI: Oo-hoo. Chris,
check this out.

42:10.345 --> 42:12.745
CHRIS: Oh, what a mess.
JESSI: Right?

42:15.083 --> 42:16.616
CHRIS: When my dad
moved off the Cosna,

42:16.751 --> 42:19.886
he thought that nobody
would ever come back out here.

42:20.021 --> 42:22.622
But he kept coming back
and preserving the homestead

42:22.757 --> 42:25.358
to make sure that it
was here for us,

42:25.427 --> 42:27.226
and so we're doing
the same thing.

42:27.295 --> 42:30.229
We are the protectors
of our land out here.

42:30.298 --> 42:36.236
KALEB: Check it out, Gilbert.
Nice, clean, clear, giardia free water

42:36.371 --> 42:39.405
that we can bring back home.
It's nice and safe now.

42:41.509 --> 42:46.512
It's our responsibility as the next
generation to pass on these skills

42:46.648 --> 42:52.118
so that it can continue on
from generation to generation.

42:52.253 --> 42:54.520
CHEVIE: So, we got
butter, onion. SONTA: Butter.

42:54.589 --> 42:57.790
CHEVIE: Duck, and white
fish. A cup of water.

42:57.926 --> 43:00.059
That's like a five
course meal, man.

43:00.194 --> 43:03.396
This is springtime right here,
ya know, duck on the fire.

43:03.465 --> 43:07.133
SONTA: Something that your grandma always
says is that you taste the Innoko River.

43:07.268 --> 43:08.434
RYDER: What?
SONTA: Yup.

43:10.338 --> 43:12.071
JHONNY: You got two
options when you live out here,

43:12.206 --> 43:15.008
you can live hand-to-mouth,
or you can shop wholesale.

43:15.143 --> 43:17.877
And getting a bear allows
me to shop wholesale.

43:18.012 --> 43:22.815
I can rest my mind because I do
have a pretty good amount of meat,

43:22.884 --> 43:25.751
that's gonna carry me through
the spring and summer.

43:25.820 --> 43:29.656
And uh, when that's run out, it's
time to go back up into the arctic.

43:30.892 --> 43:32.959
I'm nomadic.

43:33.094 --> 43:37.096
I move with the resources, and
the resources called me to be here,

43:37.231 --> 43:38.097
so I'm not gonna argue it.

43:40.568 --> 43:44.904
When I was eight years old
my dad gave me a 410 shotgun,

43:44.973 --> 43:48.441
and I remember getting
off the school bus

43:48.576 --> 43:52.445
and instead of going inside to do my
homework, I went out into the woods.

43:52.514 --> 43:54.180
He taught me safety.

43:54.249 --> 43:56.983
Patience. Perseverance.

43:57.052 --> 43:58.851
And he was very,
very strict about it.

43:58.987 --> 44:01.721
At the time, as a little kid, I
didn't always understand why

44:01.856 --> 44:04.523
but now as an adult, it
makes perfect sense.

44:04.592 --> 44:06.526
He showed me how to
handle a gun,

44:06.661 --> 44:09.329
where to point it,
where not to point it.

44:09.464 --> 44:12.198
Not only did my dad teach
me what not to point the gun at,

44:12.267 --> 44:13.733
but he taught me when
a predator,

44:13.868 --> 44:17.203
when that comes around, it's
okay to point the gun at that.

44:17.272 --> 44:18.404
As long as you eat it though.
