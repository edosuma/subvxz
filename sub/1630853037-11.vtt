(sighs) Where's Josefina
when you need her?

02:28.690 --> 02:30.400
She knew exactly what to say

02:30.441 --> 02:33.361
after Macy died.
She must've been running late.

02:35.572 --> 02:37.532
It's okay. We got this.

02:39.492 --> 02:43.037
Hey.
Hey.

02:43.079 --> 02:46.332
MAGGIE: I'm sure you're feeling
a million emotions right now.

02:46.374 --> 02:50.295
All I can say is...
we're here for you,

02:50.336 --> 02:51.629
and we get it.

02:51.671 --> 02:53.756
Losing someone is never easy.

02:53.798 --> 02:55.800
Yeah, it is, actually,

02:55.842 --> 02:59.179
if you don't get too close,
but I slipped.

02:59.220 --> 03:01.681
I let this guy in,
and now he's gone, so...

03:01.723 --> 03:04.184
Believe me, we understand.

03:04.225 --> 03:05.852
I don't think
we're ever gonna get over

03:05.894 --> 03:08.146
what happened to Macy...

03:08.188 --> 03:11.316
but time has a way...
Look, I really appreciate

03:11.357 --> 03:13.151
the whole sisterly concern,

03:13.193 --> 03:16.112
but I just,
I-I can't right now, okay?

03:16.154 --> 03:17.739
I got to go.

03:20.992 --> 03:23.828
(groans) Can you just
give me some space, please?

03:23.870 --> 03:25.580
I'm sorry.

03:25.622 --> 03:27.332
I wish we could just
curl up on the couch

03:27.373 --> 03:29.667
and cry together,
but we can't.

03:29.709 --> 03:31.628
Not while the Unseen have
The Book of Shadows.

03:31.669 --> 03:33.755
The Unseen?

03:33.796 --> 03:35.757
You're seriously gonna
bring that up right now?

03:35.798 --> 03:37.342
I know it's not easy,

03:37.383 --> 03:39.135
but this is the job--
we're the Charmed Ones.

03:39.177 --> 03:41.012
No. You're the Charmed Ones.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.722
I'm not even
your biological sister.

03:42.764 --> 03:44.557
You are our sister.

03:44.599 --> 03:46.434
Biological and chosen.

03:46.476 --> 03:48.353
I didn't choose any of this.

03:53.316 --> 03:54.943
HARRY:
You know, there are better ways

03:54.984 --> 03:56.653
to ask a person for help.

03:56.694 --> 03:58.321
I tried reasoning with you.

03:58.363 --> 04:00.573
You hit me over the head
with a flashlight.

04:00.615 --> 04:03.409
I took the batteries out.
Oh, you're a true humanitarian.

04:04.369 --> 04:05.495
(grunts)

04:06.496 --> 04:08.498
Peace offering?
No.

04:08.539 --> 04:09.999
I don't want your discount brand
candy choices.

04:10.041 --> 04:11.668
I want you to stop lying to me.

04:11.709 --> 04:14.254
I know the face of every
Whitelighter who's ever lived,

04:14.295 --> 04:16.464
but I've never seen
yours before.

04:17.382 --> 04:20.176
Because you and I are
from different worlds.

04:21.219 --> 04:22.679
Okay.

04:22.720 --> 04:24.222
Start talking.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.974
I'm Diana.

04:29.644 --> 04:31.521
Where I'm from,
there's a Charmed One

04:31.562 --> 04:33.648
with incredible
powers of premonition.

04:33.690 --> 04:35.525
Maggie Vera?

04:35.566 --> 04:36.609
No.

04:36.651 --> 04:39.487
Someone else entirely.

04:39.529 --> 04:41.239
15 years ago,
she used her powers

04:41.281 --> 04:42.699
to create this space,

04:42.740 --> 04:45.535
recording every possible version

04:45.576 --> 04:46.869
of your world's history,

04:46.911 --> 04:48.913
right here, on these tapes.

04:48.955 --> 04:50.581
(scoffs)

04:50.623 --> 04:54.002
You're telling me this witch had
the power to do all that,

04:54.043 --> 04:56.337
and she put them on VHS?

04:56.379 --> 04:57.964
I don't make the rules.

04:58.006 --> 04:59.465
I don't know, maybe
time magic isn't compatible

04:59.507 --> 05:01.342
with digital file format.

05:01.384 --> 05:03.970
The point is, for some reason,

05:04.012 --> 05:06.889
she knew that our world and
yours were connected somehow,

05:06.931 --> 05:08.975
and that these tapes
would be important.

05:09.017 --> 05:12.812
Why on earth would
a Charmed One from your world

05:12.854 --> 05:14.564
do all this for our world?

05:14.605 --> 05:17.066
That's what I'm trying
to figure out.

05:17.108 --> 05:19.485
I take it
you've watched everything?

05:19.527 --> 05:22.363
More times than you can imagine.

05:22.405 --> 05:24.532
And all I know is,
the connection--

05:24.574 --> 05:27.118
it has something to do
with you and your Charmed Ones

05:27.160 --> 05:29.245
and the Day of the Fall.

05:29.287 --> 05:31.581
That's why I need
your help.

05:31.622 --> 05:33.249
(grunts)
No.

05:33.291 --> 05:35.209
What are you doing?
I'm sorry, Diana,

05:35.251 --> 05:37.337
but I've got to go
help my friends.

05:37.378 --> 05:39.380
And this place, it's all
too absurd, even for me.

05:39.422 --> 05:42.091
No! No. No.

05:44.927 --> 05:47.013
(giggling)

05:49.849 --> 05:51.934
(muffled grunting)

05:53.561 --> 05:55.146
Chloe?

05:55.188 --> 05:57.982
(mouthful):
Oh! Jordan! Mm!

05:58.024 --> 05:59.734
Oh.

05:59.776 --> 06:01.402
You have to try these.

06:01.444 --> 06:03.321
They're amazeballs.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.907
(chuckles) I-- O-Oh.

06:09.202 --> 06:10.411
Mmm, wow.

06:10.453 --> 06:12.914
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

06:12.955 --> 06:14.832
Mmm. (chuckles) Excuse us.

06:14.874 --> 06:17.251
Chloe.
(mouthful): Thank you.

06:18.795 --> 06:19.879
What are you doing here?

06:19.921 --> 06:21.464
(gasps) Oh!

06:21.506 --> 06:24.092
It's my sister Daphne.

06:24.133 --> 06:25.885
She's gone missing.

06:25.927 --> 06:28.096
Maggie and the others are still
at a friend's memorial.

06:28.137 --> 06:30.056
I'm not here for the Ones
who are Charmed.

06:30.098 --> 06:31.516
I came here to find you.

06:31.557 --> 06:33.267
You're the Whitelighter

06:33.309 --> 06:34.977
for the rest of us.

06:35.937 --> 06:37.355
Remember?

06:37.397 --> 06:38.773
(chuckles)

06:38.815 --> 06:40.316
Uh-huh.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.820
Okay.
(chuckles)

06:43.861 --> 06:45.988
Tell me about Daphne.

06:46.030 --> 06:47.740
I didn't know you had
another sister.

06:47.782 --> 06:50.493
I woke up this morning
to the strangest note from her.

06:50.535 --> 06:52.495
Strange? How?

06:52.537 --> 06:56.249
There was no joy or whimsy.

06:56.290 --> 06:58.668
It was just ranting,

06:58.709 --> 07:00.920
and she was saying
the oddest things

07:00.962 --> 07:03.381
about our sister Annie
coming back from the dead.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.674
Can I see it?

07:04.715 --> 07:06.092
Yes.

07:06.134 --> 07:07.510
Oh.

07:13.766 --> 07:16.269
"We can bring Annie back."

07:16.310 --> 07:18.104
"A savior is coming."

07:18.146 --> 07:20.314
"The Lost One chose me."

07:21.899 --> 07:23.693
What is it?

07:24.944 --> 07:26.612
Is she in danger?

07:26.654 --> 07:29.323
I need to show this to Maggie.

07:29.365 --> 07:31.117
Right away.

07:32.618 --> 07:34.537
(ticks)

07:41.794 --> 07:43.004
Knock, knock.
(gasps)

07:43.045 --> 07:45.673
Oh, I'm sorry, did I scare you?

07:45.715 --> 07:47.717
No, I-I just...

07:47.758 --> 07:49.719
uh, have a lot on my mind.

07:49.760 --> 07:51.512
Dev?

07:51.554 --> 07:54.182
No, it's not that. I mean...

07:54.223 --> 07:57.393
I will miss him, but...

07:57.435 --> 07:58.811
we've got this house band.

07:58.853 --> 08:01.022
Oh, the Bee Bops.
Got to love a band

08:01.063 --> 08:03.608
the size of fleas that can play
any song on the planet.

08:04.567 --> 08:07.153
Well, they haven't missed a show
in a century,

08:07.195 --> 08:10.490
but I checked their cage
and they're not here.

08:10.531 --> 08:11.991
You think something happened?

08:12.033 --> 08:14.535
I don't know,
but I have to find them.

08:14.577 --> 08:16.954
I need to make sure they're okay
before....

08:16.996 --> 08:18.122
Before what?

08:19.499 --> 08:20.458
(footfalls approaching)

08:20.500 --> 08:21.584
Mel, we got to go.

08:23.252 --> 08:25.546
(sighs):
Uh...

08:25.588 --> 08:26.923
Right now?

08:26.964 --> 08:28.382
Yeah, Jordan has a lead
on the Lost One.

08:28.424 --> 08:29.717
What kind of a lead?

08:30.676 --> 08:32.094
He's not sure yet.

08:32.136 --> 08:35.264
Look, maybe you can handle
this one on your own,

08:35.306 --> 08:38.184
at least till you know
what it really means.

08:38.226 --> 08:39.519
Mel, this could have something
to do with our book.

08:39.560 --> 08:41.395
Or it could be a dead end.

08:41.437 --> 08:42.939
Or it could be
the end of the world.

08:42.980 --> 08:45.399
Maybe,
but it's that kind of obsession

08:45.441 --> 08:47.568
with saving the world that
blew up my last relationship,

08:47.610 --> 08:48.986
and I refuse to do that again.

08:49.028 --> 08:50.404
So, you're seriously
picking her?

08:50.446 --> 08:52.573
I am not "picking" anyone.

08:52.615 --> 08:53.699
And how am I supposed to know

08:53.741 --> 08:55.284
this isn't some wild-goose chase

08:55.326 --> 08:57.078
because you are so desperate
to figure out

08:57.119 --> 08:58.454
where you and Jordan stand?

08:58.496 --> 09:00.164
I know where
me and Jordan stand.

09:00.206 --> 09:03.125
You guys had sex, like,
four times the other day

09:03.167 --> 09:04.669
and still haven't
talked about it.

09:04.710 --> 09:06.921
Wow. Okay.

09:06.963 --> 09:08.631
You have fun
with your new girlfriend.

09:08.673 --> 09:10.758
I'm gonna find Kaela
and save some lives.

09:11.676 --> 09:12.927
(scoffs)

09:12.969 --> 09:14.178
Kaela, I know you're upset,

09:14.220 --> 09:15.346
but I really need your...

09:17.348 --> 09:19.725
...help.

09:25.481 --> 09:27.316
(over phone):
Hey, it's Brynn.
Leave me a message.

09:27.358 --> 09:30.528
Or, you know, just text me
like a normal person.

09:30.570 --> 09:31.904
(phone beeps)

09:31.946 --> 09:33.864
Hey, B. I know you hate
voice mails,

09:33.906 --> 09:36.075
but I just...
I'm kind of spiraling,

09:36.117 --> 09:37.702
and I really need
to talk to someone.

09:37.743 --> 09:39.704
Just someone who really gets me,
you know?

09:39.745 --> 09:42.331
I just need to be at home
with you and my mom

09:42.373 --> 09:44.041
feeding me banana fritters,
you know?

09:44.083 --> 09:45.251
(crackles)

09:46.419 --> 09:47.962
I swear I just charged it.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.591
(gasps)
(tires screech)

09:51.632 --> 09:53.009
(thud)

09:56.470 --> 09:57.930
Oh, my God.

10:04.854 --> 10:06.522
The hell did she go?

10:06.564 --> 10:09.775
(clattering, hissing)

10:12.153 --> 10:14.447
(coughs)

10:15.615 --> 10:18.701
So, you've known these little
dudes for a long time, huh?

10:18.743 --> 10:20.077
Feels like forever.

10:20.119 --> 10:22.121
The Bee Bops came
to me in 1917,

10:22.163 --> 10:23.873
when their village was
destroyed during the war.

10:23.914 --> 10:25.666
Hmm. And you took them in?

10:25.708 --> 10:28.002
Well, they needed a home,
and I needed a band.

10:28.044 --> 10:29.670
Really?

10:29.712 --> 10:31.631
That's the only reason
you let them live with you?

10:31.672 --> 10:32.923
Fine.

10:32.965 --> 10:34.634
They are ridiculously adorable.

10:34.675 --> 10:36.093
(both laugh)

10:36.135 --> 10:38.679
Iron Maiden my ass.
Yeah, yeah.

10:38.721 --> 10:40.348
I'm softer than
a baby Zamba Zaraa,

10:40.389 --> 10:41.474
but don't you dare tell anyone.

10:41.515 --> 10:43.768
I have a reputation to uphold.

10:48.272 --> 10:49.565
Okay, this is amazing.

10:49.607 --> 10:51.859
Wait until you look inside.

10:57.823 --> 11:00.034
Oh, God,
you need to see this.

11:04.914 --> 11:06.374
CHLOE:
OM-frigging-G,

11:06.415 --> 11:07.708
you guys.

11:07.750 --> 11:10.044
I feel like I'm on a TV show.

11:10.086 --> 11:11.420
(laughs)

11:11.462 --> 11:14.382
CSI: Magical Victims Unit.

11:14.423 --> 11:15.633
(exhales rhythmically)

11:17.385 --> 11:19.845
(sighs)

11:20.971 --> 11:23.766
I'm-a guess I shouldn't ask
why Kaela and Mel didn't show.

11:23.808 --> 11:25.643
Yup.

11:26.602 --> 11:28.562
All right, well,

11:28.604 --> 11:30.940
if you want to
talk about it...
I...

11:30.981 --> 11:32.983
(clears throat)

11:33.025 --> 11:34.318
Here we go.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.903
"Praeterita alii vide."

11:35.945 --> 11:37.822
The Flip-side Spell.

11:37.863 --> 11:39.990
This will show me
Daphne's most powerful memories,

11:40.032 --> 11:41.951
exactly how she saw them.

11:41.992 --> 11:45.830
So, you think this will show
how she was radicalized.

11:45.871 --> 11:49.500
And what the Unseen are doing
with The Book of Shadows.

11:50.626 --> 11:52.169
I think they're planning
something big.

11:54.296 --> 11:55.589
(Chloe gasps)

11:55.631 --> 11:57.383
Is that, like,

11:57.425 --> 11:59.343
a sacred, magical lasso

11:59.385 --> 12:01.303
that's been passed down

12:01.345 --> 12:02.972
by generations
of witches?

12:03.013 --> 12:05.266
Nope. It's, uh,
it's just a rope.

12:05.307 --> 12:07.810
Oh. (chuckles)

12:07.852 --> 12:09.270
MAGGIE:
With memories this powerful,

12:09.311 --> 12:11.439
it's possible to get stuck
in the spell.

12:11.480 --> 12:12.565
For how long?

12:13.524 --> 12:14.525
Forever.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.694
(gasps) Jeepers.

12:16.736 --> 12:19.363
I'll be fine.
Just hold on tight

12:19.405 --> 12:21.198
and pull me up
when I tell you to.

12:22.116 --> 12:26.245
And if we run into any trouble,
we can use these to communicate.

12:26.287 --> 12:27.788
(scoffs)

12:27.830 --> 12:28.998
Kind of afraid to ask
where you got 'em.

12:29.039 --> 12:30.124
Uh, let's just say,

12:30.166 --> 12:32.918
Ray has a "friend" in the CIA.

12:32.960 --> 12:35.254
(laughs)
Oh, Chloe.

12:35.296 --> 12:37.506
I need something
that belonged to your sister.

12:38.466 --> 12:39.675
Right.

12:39.717 --> 12:42.344
Right! Oh, okay, um...

12:42.386 --> 12:43.888
Okay.

12:43.929 --> 12:46.766
Let me think of something,
and... (chuckles)

12:47.641 --> 12:48.642
Think of something.

12:48.684 --> 12:50.352
Not that.

12:50.394 --> 12:52.396
(mutters)
(objects clatter)

12:52.438 --> 12:55.441
Oh! Found it. (chuckles)

12:56.442 --> 12:58.152
It's her favorite shade
of lip gloss.

12:58.194 --> 13:00.237
Rainbow Sparkle.

13:00.279 --> 13:02.782
Oh. (chuckles)

13:04.074 --> 13:06.118
Should be interesting.

13:07.077 --> 13:11.165
Radiator, water pump, starter,
electrical, all good.

13:15.085 --> 13:17.129
It should be starting.

13:19.215 --> 13:21.008
(sighs)

13:27.348 --> 13:29.391
Where the hell are my tools?

13:30.893 --> 13:32.978
(vehicle approaching)
(horn honks)

13:38.692 --> 13:40.778
(engine stops)

13:42.071 --> 13:43.823
(door closes)

13:49.036 --> 13:51.205
You call a mechanic?

13:52.164 --> 13:53.207
Weren't-weren't you
just standing

13:53.249 --> 13:54.583
in the middle of the road,

13:54.625 --> 13:56.293
like, three minutes ago
in a dress?

13:56.335 --> 13:58.546
Hmm, nope. Wasn't me.

13:58.587 --> 14:00.130
So, what's up with your bus?

14:00.172 --> 14:02.424
Which is dope,
I might add.

14:02.466 --> 14:04.051
Reminds me of this groovy
tie-dye bus I used to

14:04.093 --> 14:06.554
drive around to all the national
parks way back when.

14:06.595 --> 14:08.681
Called her Suzie Q.
(chuckles)

14:08.722 --> 14:10.349
Wait,
what were we talking about?

14:10.391 --> 14:11.809
I don't know.

14:11.851 --> 14:14.228
Um, so, who-who even called you?

14:14.270 --> 14:17.439
Would you believe me
if I said... fate?

14:21.110 --> 14:22.236
Ishani.

14:23.195 --> 14:25.406
The first Charmed Ones:

14:25.447 --> 14:27.241
Ishta, Inara, Ishani.

14:28.284 --> 14:30.661
You're one of
the original Charmed Ones.

14:31.620 --> 14:33.247
Busted.

14:33.289 --> 14:34.498
(gasps)

14:41.797 --> 14:43.507
ROXIE:
I just don't get it.

14:43.549 --> 14:45.509
Why would anyone want
to kill a Bee Bop?

14:45.551 --> 14:47.177
We'll figure it out.

14:47.219 --> 14:49.680
Someone got out of
that dollhouse alive.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.390
They'll have answers.

14:51.432 --> 14:54.018
I'm just so glad that
Maggie isn't here to see this.

14:54.059 --> 14:55.811
I borrowed her pants,
and she will kill me

14:55.853 --> 14:58.314
if she knew I was getting
bar floor all over them.

14:58.355 --> 15:00.190
Everything okay with you two?

15:00.232 --> 15:02.109
She seemed pretty upset
earlier.

15:02.151 --> 15:04.236
Honestly, I don't know.

15:04.278 --> 15:07.573
This whole year has been
so hard on her,

15:07.615 --> 15:11.035
on all of us, but we can't
keep making the same mistakes.

15:11.076 --> 15:13.287
And I just wish she understood
that I wasn't abandoning her

15:13.329 --> 15:15.664
by being here with you.

15:18.751 --> 15:19.960
(grunts)

15:20.002 --> 15:22.254
Thank you, by the way.

15:22.296 --> 15:26.216
It means a lot
having you here... today.

15:26.258 --> 15:30.095
Especially because of everything
you have on your plate.

15:30.137 --> 15:31.639
Rox, I'm exactly

15:31.680 --> 15:33.349
where I want to be.

15:38.145 --> 15:41.065
(sighs)
Well,

15:41.106 --> 15:42.942
whoever escaped that house

15:42.983 --> 15:45.945
must be hiding
in this crack in the wall.

15:45.986 --> 15:48.155
So, what do we do?

15:49.531 --> 15:52.534
Drink Me Potion.
Oh, God.

15:52.576 --> 15:55.663
(scoffs)
It makes you whatever
size you need to be.

15:55.704 --> 15:57.373
Yeah, I know what it does.

15:57.414 --> 15:58.958
Hence the condescending voice.

15:58.999 --> 16:00.709
I know what you're gonna
say, and I promise you,

16:00.751 --> 16:03.879
this isn't going to be like
my cockamamie 1920s plan.

16:03.921 --> 16:05.673
You can trust me.
That is exactly what you said

16:05.714 --> 16:08.175
before
your cockamamie 1920s plan.

16:08.217 --> 16:10.427
Just think about the
exact size you want to be,

16:10.469 --> 16:11.971
and the potion
will get you there.

16:12.012 --> 16:13.639
And then all we need to
do is take another drop,

16:13.681 --> 16:16.016
and we go back to normal.

16:25.901 --> 16:28.237
(both exhale)

16:28.278 --> 16:30.739
(high-pitched): Is it
supposed to feel like this?

16:34.410 --> 16:36.912
Oh, that is so your color.

16:37.871 --> 16:39.415
(chuckles)

16:39.456 --> 16:40.791
Okay.

16:42.334 --> 16:45.921
Praeterita alii vide.

16:48.215 --> 16:49.174
(gasps)

16:49.216 --> 16:51.218
(wind whistling)

16:51.260 --> 16:53.429
CHLOE:
Oh. (chuckles, gasps)

16:53.470 --> 16:55.305
Oh.

16:55.347 --> 16:57.016
So,

16:57.057 --> 17:00.227
is Daphne, um...

17:00.269 --> 17:01.854
down there?

17:01.895 --> 17:03.522
No, not the real Daphne.

17:03.564 --> 17:05.399
I'll just be watching
one of her memories,

17:05.441 --> 17:06.692
trying to figure out
where she went

17:06.734 --> 17:09.153
and how she's connected
to the Lost One.

17:10.112 --> 17:11.113
Remember,

17:11.155 --> 17:12.364
don't let go.

17:12.406 --> 17:14.324
That rope is my
only way out.

17:14.366 --> 17:16.660
I would never.

17:19.246 --> 17:20.706
Um...

17:21.790 --> 17:24.877
Uh, when I get back,
we should talk.

17:24.918 --> 17:26.754
About?

17:27.713 --> 17:29.506
Us.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.148
(exhales)

17:56.658 --> 17:59.119
(gasps)

18:05.834 --> 18:07.169
DAPHNE:
Annie.

18:07.211 --> 18:09.880
Annie, I can't do this anymore.

18:09.922 --> 18:12.466
I can't keep waking
up every single day

18:12.508 --> 18:14.593
not hearing your laugh.

18:15.552 --> 18:16.970
(wind gusts)
(Annie laughs)

18:17.012 --> 18:18.680
Annie!
(gasps)

18:20.432 --> 18:21.725
Oh, my God.

18:21.767 --> 18:24.770
How are you... How is this...

18:24.812 --> 18:26.647
You're-you're
supposed to be dead.

18:26.688 --> 18:28.232
I am, Daph.

18:28.273 --> 18:30.109
But I don't have to be.

18:30.150 --> 18:31.819
Not for long.

18:31.860 --> 18:34.404
(sighs)

18:41.328 --> 18:42.830
How are you even alive?

18:42.871 --> 18:44.873
Aren't you, like,
10,000 years old?

18:44.915 --> 18:47.417
Would you believe me
if I said...

18:47.459 --> 18:48.752
yoga?

18:48.794 --> 18:50.462
Ugh. You know what?
No. Forget it.

18:50.504 --> 18:53.382
I'm so tired of all of this.
No, Michaela.

18:53.423 --> 18:55.676
Wait. You can't leave.

18:55.717 --> 18:57.845
If you do, it'll be
just like the Day of the Fall.

18:57.886 --> 18:59.263
The day of the what?

18:59.304 --> 19:01.140
You can't walk away
from your destiny.

19:01.181 --> 19:02.474
(chuckles)
My destiny.

19:02.516 --> 19:04.434
This is not my destiny.

19:04.476 --> 19:06.979
And Mel and Maggie
aren't my real sisters.

19:07.020 --> 19:10.357
Well, guess what. We weren't
sisters by blood either.

19:10.399 --> 19:14.361
Ishta, Inara and I, we
chose to join each other.

19:15.320 --> 19:17.823
That wasn't
in my history lesson.

19:18.824 --> 19:20.450
Do you like banana fritters?

19:20.492 --> 19:21.785
What?

19:21.827 --> 19:23.495
Come! Sit.

19:23.537 --> 19:25.622
Everything's better with food.

19:33.797 --> 19:37.092
(breathes deeply)

19:37.134 --> 19:40.220
Dude, seriously.
You got to try these.

19:41.597 --> 19:44.308
They do smell amazing.
(chuckles)

19:44.349 --> 19:46.435
Okay.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.402
(chuckles)

19:56.570 --> 19:58.280
These taste just like my mom's.

19:58.322 --> 19:59.740
It's funny.

19:59.781 --> 20:01.783
The American doughnut
gets all the buzz,

20:01.825 --> 20:04.036
but Ghanaian fritters
are where it's at.
(laughs)

20:04.995 --> 20:07.164
Mmm. You're wild.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.958
You say that now. Just wait
till the drugs kick in.

20:11.919 --> 20:13.295
The what?

20:13.337 --> 20:14.671
I'm gonna say this fast

20:14.713 --> 20:16.715
because you only have,
like, 11 seconds.

20:16.757 --> 20:18.926
But something terrible
is coming, and it can't

20:18.967 --> 20:21.011
be stopped without you.
Only I know

20:21.053 --> 20:22.971
how stubborn you are,
so instead of telling you,

20:23.013 --> 20:24.556
I figured I'd just show you.

20:24.598 --> 20:26.808
Are you for real right now?

20:26.850 --> 20:29.311
It'll be fun!
Just like a road trip.

20:29.353 --> 20:31.480
Without roads.

20:31.521 --> 20:33.232
Fine.

20:33.273 --> 20:35.025
But when we get back,
we're gonna have

20:35.067 --> 20:37.694
a very serious chat
about consent.

20:43.158 --> 20:45.077
How are you even here?

20:45.118 --> 20:47.871
With the Lost One,
anything is possible.

20:47.913 --> 20:49.289
I don't understand.

20:49.331 --> 20:52.542
Long ago, the nine
original tribes of magic

20:52.584 --> 20:56.004
came together
to forge the ultimate power.

20:56.046 --> 20:58.590
Lamias, trolls,

20:58.632 --> 20:59.967
leprechauns,

21:00.008 --> 21:02.094
pixies.
(chuckles)

21:02.135 --> 21:03.720
Now the nine

21:03.762 --> 21:06.139
are coming together again
to raise the Lost One.

21:06.181 --> 21:08.642
And you've been chosen
to join them.

21:09.601 --> 21:11.019
Why me?

21:11.061 --> 21:13.605
Because you're special, Daph.

21:13.647 --> 21:15.107
And you're hurting.

21:15.148 --> 21:16.483
The Lost One

21:16.525 --> 21:17.734
can bring me back,

21:17.776 --> 21:19.611
and you and me, Chloe,

21:19.653 --> 21:21.280
we can finally have

21:21.321 --> 21:23.365
the life
we were always meant to have.

21:23.407 --> 21:25.826
Where do you need me to go?

21:25.867 --> 21:28.537
Just south of Baghdad
to the Akahtu Mines.

21:29.871 --> 21:33.333
Other Unseen creatures have
been there for weeks, digging.

21:33.375 --> 21:35.919
Now they're finally ready
for you.

21:35.961 --> 21:37.921
They found the Lost One's tomb.

21:38.880 --> 21:41.258
(demonic voice):
You're not supposed to be here!

21:41.300 --> 21:42.592
Who are you talking to?

21:43.593 --> 21:45.470
Flip-side Spell, eh?

21:45.512 --> 21:48.015
Nice try, Charmed One.

21:50.434 --> 21:52.644
Good luck getting
out of here now.

21:52.686 --> 21:55.272
(giggles)

22:15.709 --> 22:17.210
Hello?

22:18.128 --> 22:19.796
Anyone here?

22:21.131 --> 22:22.507
Mel?

22:22.549 --> 22:24.051
Roxie?

22:27.596 --> 22:29.556
Mel?

22:29.598 --> 22:30.557
Roxie?

22:30.599 --> 22:32.684
(Roxie and Mel grunting)

22:42.194 --> 22:44.780
(inhales, groans)

22:44.821 --> 22:46.448
Lloyd?

22:46.490 --> 22:47.783
Roxie?

22:47.824 --> 22:49.284
(grunts)

22:49.326 --> 22:50.660
Oh!

22:50.702 --> 22:52.662
How are you...? Why...?

22:52.704 --> 22:54.122
Drink Me Potion.

22:54.164 --> 22:55.999
This is what you get
for dating a witch.

22:56.041 --> 22:57.292
So, what the hell happened?

22:58.543 --> 22:59.920
You know Pip's dead, right?

22:59.961 --> 23:02.214
I-I don't know.
It was all s-such a blur.

23:02.255 --> 23:03.507
Did you see who did it?

23:04.341 --> 23:05.300
Roxie?

23:05.342 --> 23:06.927
Look out!

23:06.968 --> 23:09.971
How could you do this, Rox?
Sleeping with the enemy?

23:10.013 --> 23:11.348
Roxie, he's one of them.

23:11.390 --> 23:12.891
Lloyd, she's not the enemy.

23:12.933 --> 23:15.060
That's exactly what Pip said.

23:15.102 --> 23:16.728
Before I killed her.

23:18.522 --> 23:19.981
MEL:
He's trying to grow.

23:20.023 --> 23:21.650
(grunts)

23:23.360 --> 23:25.195
(thud)

23:27.572 --> 23:29.574
Now, where did you come from?

23:32.744 --> 23:34.496
Jordan, can you hear me?

23:34.538 --> 23:36.248
JORDAN:
I'm coming down to help you.
No, no, no.

23:36.289 --> 23:38.041
No, you'll just get
stuck down here, too.

23:38.083 --> 23:40.710
It's fine. We got this.
At least we'll be together.

23:40.752 --> 23:42.045
Jordan, you have to stop.

23:42.087 --> 23:43.338
Give me a minute.
I'll be right there.

23:43.380 --> 23:45.590
Please, Jordan. Just...

23:45.632 --> 23:47.259
Just listen to me.

23:47.300 --> 23:48.885
You have to stop

23:48.927 --> 23:52.222
risking everything for me.

23:52.264 --> 23:53.890
What?
And I have to stop

23:53.932 --> 23:56.518
running to you anytime
something goes wrong in my life.

23:58.270 --> 24:01.231
This isn't a healthy foundation
for a relationship.

24:01.273 --> 24:03.191
But how will you...

24:03.233 --> 24:04.818
(breathing heavily)

24:04.860 --> 24:06.361
I mean...

24:07.863 --> 24:10.115
You're all alone down there.

24:11.074 --> 24:12.742
(voice breaking):
I'm gonna figure it out.

24:14.661 --> 24:17.831
And then we'll
figure us out.

24:31.845 --> 24:34.264
Hey, Jordan, I need
to talk to Chloe.

24:40.395 --> 24:42.689
Hey, Chloe?
Oh!

24:42.731 --> 24:44.399
How do you make
your wings come out?

24:44.441 --> 24:45.650
Um...

24:45.692 --> 24:48.195
That's kind of a private matter.

24:48.236 --> 24:49.696
No, I mean...

24:49.738 --> 24:51.364
If the Lost One
was strong enough

24:51.406 --> 24:53.617
to interact with me in a spell,

24:53.658 --> 24:56.828
maybe I can interact with
Daphne and borrow her power.

24:56.870 --> 24:58.246
And with wings, maybe I could...

24:58.288 --> 24:59.623
maybe I could fly out of here.

24:59.664 --> 25:01.500
Oh, why didn't you
just say that?

25:01.541 --> 25:03.793
You just close your eyes,

25:03.835 --> 25:05.879
think of happy thoughts,

25:05.921 --> 25:08.423
and imagine you're floating.

25:08.465 --> 25:09.633
That's it?

25:09.674 --> 25:10.800
Mm-hmm.

25:10.842 --> 25:13.136
Easy peasy mac and cheesy.

25:26.274 --> 25:27.901
(exhales)

25:27.943 --> 25:29.861
(chuckles softly)

25:42.999 --> 25:44.376
(laughter)

25:59.724 --> 26:01.226
Jeepers.

26:07.065 --> 26:08.733
Reveni.

26:17.450 --> 26:19.536
You got talent, kid.

26:20.620 --> 26:22.581
What is all this?

26:23.540 --> 26:25.417
It's our story.

26:25.458 --> 26:28.837
In a language
I figured you'd understand best.

26:28.878 --> 26:29.963
Huh.

26:31.548 --> 26:34.551
Is that the Conqueror?
ISHANI:
After he tried

26:34.593 --> 26:36.970
to steal all the world's magic
for himself,

26:37.012 --> 26:40.181
an ultimate weapon was needed
to fight back.

26:40.223 --> 26:44.227
So the nine original tribes
came together and gave up

26:44.269 --> 26:45.478
their remaining power.

26:45.520 --> 26:47.188
Into the Unity Bowl.

26:47.230 --> 26:48.481
ISHANI:
That's right.

26:48.523 --> 26:50.066
It was
their collective magic

26:50.108 --> 26:52.319
that created
the Power of Three.

26:52.360 --> 26:54.821
And knowing only a trio
of witches would be

26:54.863 --> 26:56.239
strong enough
to hold all that power,

26:56.281 --> 26:58.199
they asked us
to drink of the bowl,

26:58.241 --> 27:01.536
making us
the first Charmed Ones.

27:01.578 --> 27:03.288
After we defeated him,

27:03.330 --> 27:04.956
the three of us
no longer had

27:04.998 --> 27:06.458
a shared purpose.

27:06.499 --> 27:08.335
We had chosen
to be Charmed Ones,

27:08.376 --> 27:11.338
but we had never chosen
to be sisters.

27:11.379 --> 27:14.924
So when the battle was over,
we drifted apart.

27:14.966 --> 27:16.468
Sounds familiar.

27:16.509 --> 27:18.511
That's when Inara
wanted to release

27:18.553 --> 27:21.640
the Conqueror's stolen power
back out into the world.

27:21.681 --> 27:23.183
To put magic everywhere.

27:23.224 --> 27:24.726
But Ishta and I knew
it was too risky.

27:24.768 --> 27:27.270
The temptation
would always be there

27:27.312 --> 27:29.230
for another Conqueror
to rise up.

27:29.272 --> 27:31.191
That's why
we put it all

27:31.232 --> 27:33.777
in one place and hid it away,

27:33.818 --> 27:35.070
where no one
would find it.

27:35.111 --> 27:36.613
KAELA:
Into the Source.

27:36.655 --> 27:37.781
You know your stuff.

27:37.822 --> 27:39.491
I had a good teacher.

27:39.532 --> 27:41.409
ISHANI:
Anyway,

27:41.451 --> 27:44.204
the argument tore us apart.

27:44.245 --> 27:45.664
Inara grew to hate us.

27:45.705 --> 27:48.249
She wanted to take on
all that power

27:48.291 --> 27:51.294
and fix things
as a "benign" Conqueror.

27:51.336 --> 27:53.171
But we knew
where that would lead.

27:53.213 --> 27:55.840
So Ishta and I made the
hardest decision of our lives.

27:55.882 --> 27:57.425
What?

27:57.467 --> 28:00.595
We sealed her up in a tomb
in the Akhatu Mines,

28:00.637 --> 28:04.015
where she wouldn't be a
threat to us or the world.

28:04.057 --> 28:05.892
You buried her? Alive?

28:05.934 --> 28:07.686
We thought we had no choice.

28:07.727 --> 28:11.022
But the magic that
empowered us, it punished us

28:11.064 --> 28:13.692
for destroying the sisterhood.

28:13.733 --> 28:16.903
Ishta was bound to the Tree
to serve as Guardian

28:16.945 --> 28:18.363
to future Charmed Ones,

28:18.405 --> 28:22.158
and I was left to
wander the Earth alone

28:22.200 --> 28:24.202
for all eternity.

28:24.244 --> 28:26.329
This original sin,

28:26.371 --> 28:27.997
the Day of the Fall,

28:28.039 --> 28:30.959
it's also why
every sisterhood since

28:31.000 --> 28:33.253
has been doomed to be destroyed.

28:33.294 --> 28:34.879
Even when they are
bound by blood.

28:34.921 --> 28:38.091
But this time I couldn't
watch from the sidelines.

28:38.133 --> 28:40.427
I thought maybe, if I could
somehow get through to you,

28:40.468 --> 28:41.845
she could be stopped.

28:41.886 --> 28:43.304
She?

28:43.346 --> 28:45.432
After spending all that time
alone in a tomb,

28:45.473 --> 28:47.767
Inara's grown even more hateful.

28:47.809 --> 28:53.106
Her dream of sharing magic has
warped into something terrible.

28:53.148 --> 28:56.609
So the Lost One isn't just
some ancient monster, it's...

28:56.651 --> 28:58.111
it's Inara.

28:58.153 --> 28:59.654
And she's going
to get out tonight

28:59.696 --> 29:02.282
unless you and your sisterhood
can stop her.

29:04.909 --> 29:06.536
What happened to your arm?

29:06.578 --> 29:08.288
Oh, it was-- it was
just an accident.

29:08.329 --> 29:10.623
Broken bottle, so...

29:10.665 --> 29:12.417
I-I'm just gonna slip out
and go see a doctor.

29:12.459 --> 29:13.918
No...
(grunts)

29:15.336 --> 29:17.088
I was just about to do that.

29:17.130 --> 29:18.548
Yeah, sure you were, Har.

29:18.590 --> 29:19.883
ROXIE:
What the hell
happened to you?

29:19.924 --> 29:22.218
Why did you kill
your own bandmate?

29:22.260 --> 29:24.679
I did what I had to do
to protect the Lost One.

29:24.721 --> 29:25.847
Not you, too.

29:25.889 --> 29:27.849
It was Sunny who opened my eyes.

29:27.891 --> 29:29.267
Told us
what was coming,

29:29.309 --> 29:31.227
about the new world
we could be a part of.

29:31.269 --> 29:33.730
Where it didn't matter
how small we were.

29:33.772 --> 29:35.356
We'd finally have a voice.

29:35.398 --> 29:37.358
And Pip didn't fall for it,
did she?

29:37.400 --> 29:39.319
That little maggot said
she was going to tell you

29:39.360 --> 29:43.072
about the resurrection ceremony,
so I had to shut her up.

29:43.114 --> 29:45.074
But it was worth it.

29:45.116 --> 29:47.619
We just had to make it
to the Day of the Fall.

29:47.660 --> 29:49.162
The Day of the Fall?

29:49.204 --> 29:51.331
There's nothing you can do
to stop it anyway.

29:51.372 --> 29:54.000
The Lost One found
another way to rise.

29:54.042 --> 29:57.545
But first the Power of Three
had to split apart,

29:57.587 --> 29:59.547
just like in the past.

29:59.589 --> 30:01.841
I need to find Kaela and Maggie
and patch things up.

30:01.883 --> 30:03.635
(grunts)

30:05.637 --> 30:08.723
Go. But promise me
you'll be careful.

30:08.765 --> 30:10.308
No more cockamamie plans.

30:10.350 --> 30:11.935
I promise.

30:17.190 --> 30:18.441
What was that for?

30:18.483 --> 30:21.569
I just, I'm gonna miss you.

30:21.611 --> 30:23.947
I'll see you when I get back.

30:25.657 --> 30:27.283
Are you coming?

30:28.535 --> 30:31.120
Actually, I think there's
somewhere else I need be.

30:32.038 --> 30:34.958
(sighs)
That was close.

30:34.999 --> 30:36.709
Jordan, we can't
keep doing this.

30:36.751 --> 30:38.503
Mags, come on.

30:38.545 --> 30:41.005
Just look at Kaela and Dev.

30:41.047 --> 30:43.341
Look at Harry and Macy.

30:43.383 --> 30:45.593
This life is too dangerous to...

30:46.511 --> 30:48.346
To love each other?

30:48.388 --> 30:51.182
To need each other.

30:51.224 --> 30:52.851
This whole codependent,

30:52.892 --> 30:54.561
"lean on me when the world
goes to hell" thing

30:54.602 --> 30:59.691
we've had since Macy died...
it's not healthy.

30:59.732 --> 31:02.110
And when the fight's over,
what are we gonna have left?

31:02.151 --> 31:03.444
♪ There's nothing left to say ♪

31:03.486 --> 31:05.113
A future.

31:05.154 --> 31:08.366
♪ We're firing off
in different ways ♪

31:08.408 --> 31:09.576
♪ We do this all the time ♪

31:09.617 --> 31:11.202

31:11.244 --> 31:16.291
♪ And I'm over and out... ♪

31:16.332 --> 31:18.710
I have to stay focused,
and I can't do that

31:18.751 --> 31:20.753
when I'm constantly
worried about us.

31:20.795 --> 31:22.505
♪ I don't think
it'll hurt me anyway ♪

31:22.547 --> 31:24.048
Fine.

31:24.090 --> 31:25.925
♪ But please don't
get it twisted... ♪

31:25.967 --> 31:27.594
I get it.

31:27.635 --> 31:29.262
♪ Over and out... ♪

31:29.304 --> 31:33.141
If you have to leave
to process this, I understand.

31:33.182 --> 31:34.851
I'm not going anywhere.

31:35.852 --> 31:38.646
Whether or not
we're together...

31:40.565 --> 31:43.109
...I'm still gonna be there
for you, Maggie.

31:43.151 --> 31:45.194
♪ What do you see? ♪

31:45.236 --> 31:48.197

I'm sorry, too.

32:06.049 --> 32:09.719
But, um, my sister?

32:09.761 --> 32:10.887
Right.

32:10.929 --> 32:13.264
Um, that change
that came over

32:13.306 --> 32:14.682
your sister?

32:14.724 --> 32:16.809
It's because she was
talking to Annie.

32:16.851 --> 32:19.020
What?
Not the real Annie.

32:19.062 --> 32:22.065
It was the Lost One
using Annie's body.

32:22.106 --> 32:25.234
Just like the Tallyman did
with his dead brother.

32:25.276 --> 32:26.736
Yeah, turns out
the Tallyman's attacks

32:26.778 --> 32:29.948
weren't entirely random acts
of terrorism.

32:29.989 --> 32:32.158
He was targeting
nine specific groups,

32:32.200 --> 32:35.244
the nine original
tribes of magic.

32:35.286 --> 32:38.581
Ruining their lives so that
they would turn against us.

32:38.623 --> 32:39.916
And, Chloe...

32:41.042 --> 32:43.002
...your sister's one of them.

32:43.044 --> 32:46.464
THE NINE:
Amissam feremus in vitam.

32:46.506 --> 32:48.383
Amissam feremus

32:48.424 --> 32:49.592
in vitam.

32:49.634 --> 32:53.554
Amissam feremus in vitam.

32:53.596 --> 32:57.183
Amissam feremus
in vitam.

33:02.772 --> 33:03.815
(insects chirping)

33:03.856 --> 33:05.358
Why does it have to be me

33:05.400 --> 33:07.276
who stops Inara?

33:07.318 --> 33:09.654
I-I'm just someone
who-who got leukemia

33:09.696 --> 33:11.990
and had a fluke
stem cell donation.

33:12.031 --> 33:14.575
There are no flukes, Michaela.

33:14.617 --> 33:16.911
Not in our line of work.

33:16.953 --> 33:18.538
Macy Vaughn's stem cells went

33:18.579 --> 33:20.289
to five other people,
and none of them

33:20.331 --> 33:22.291
became a Charmed One.

33:22.333 --> 33:24.127
Forces much stronger
and older than I am

33:24.168 --> 33:28.297
chose you for this because
of who you are, deep down.

33:30.216 --> 33:32.176
And now you need
to make a choice.

33:36.681 --> 33:40.143
Are you going to be
their sister or not?

33:50.486 --> 33:53.197
We need a distraction
to get around the guards.

33:53.239 --> 33:55.408
MEL:
I have an idea.

33:55.450 --> 33:57.493
How about a couple sisters
fighting like idiots,

33:57.535 --> 33:59.704
when they really should
be working together?

34:01.122 --> 34:02.790
I'm sorry.

34:02.832 --> 34:05.793
It's just everything's
been piling up with...

34:05.835 --> 34:08.921
with Jordan and my two dads and
the end of the friggin' world.

34:08.963 --> 34:10.715
I shouldn't have
taken it out on you.

34:10.757 --> 34:13.509
It's all right. I'm sorry, too.

34:15.178 --> 34:16.471
Still no Kaela?

34:18.389 --> 34:19.766
Okay.

34:19.807 --> 34:21.642
Then you guys
should go find Daphne.

34:21.684 --> 34:23.728
I'll stay here
and cause a ruckus.

34:25.396 --> 34:26.773
Thanks, sis.

34:26.814 --> 34:28.608
Good luck.

34:36.699 --> 34:37.867
Hey, asshats.

34:37.909 --> 34:40.620
Goddess of gray,
conceal my way.

34:40.661 --> 34:43.122
(indistinct shouting)

34:46.959 --> 34:48.669
(grunting)

34:54.634 --> 34:56.719
(panting)

34:56.761 --> 34:58.679
I thought there were
supposed to be nine.

34:58.721 --> 35:00.014
I offer myself to you,

35:00.056 --> 35:03.893
Lost One, for the
world that was,

35:03.935 --> 35:05.436
and the world
that is yet to come.

35:07.355 --> 35:08.606
Oh, my God.

35:08.648 --> 35:10.108
They're giving up
their lives for this.

35:10.149 --> 35:11.400
Daphne?

35:12.360 --> 35:13.486
Daph?

35:13.528 --> 35:15.404
You can't do this.

35:16.697 --> 35:18.783
Daph... Daph.

35:24.455 --> 35:27.291
Chloe? Y-You're not
supposed to be here.

35:27.333 --> 35:29.377
Neither are you.
No.

35:29.418 --> 35:31.504
I was chosen for this.

35:35.133 --> 35:35.716
You're being lied to.

35:37.635 --> 35:39.679
The Lost One understands
what I'm going through.

35:39.720 --> 35:41.389
So do I, Daph.

35:41.430 --> 35:46.060
What it feels like to be alone
and-and... and powerless.

35:46.102 --> 35:48.521
Hey, I understand. Believe me.

35:48.563 --> 35:51.315
You're a Charmed One. You
wouldn't know the first thing.

35:53.192 --> 35:56.279
Daphne, I lost a sister, too.

35:57.488 --> 35:58.781
And I became something
I'm not proud of

35:58.823 --> 36:03.161
because I didn't want
to feel anymore.

36:03.202 --> 36:04.745
But there are no easy fixes,

36:04.787 --> 36:07.665
and anyone who tells you
there are is lying to you.

36:10.334 --> 36:11.586
No.

36:11.627 --> 36:14.172
Please.

36:14.213 --> 36:16.132
I can't lose you, too.

36:16.174 --> 36:19.385
I'm sorry. It's too late.

36:21.846 --> 36:24.348
No!
Chloe.

36:24.390 --> 36:26.851
You got to get her out of here.

36:26.893 --> 36:28.644
What about you?

36:28.686 --> 36:32.106
She'll be all right.
She's got her sisters.

36:33.900 --> 36:37.361
Come on, Chloe.

36:37.403 --> 36:38.779
Thought we'd never
see you again.

36:38.821 --> 36:41.616
Yeah, lost myself
for a minute there,

36:41.657 --> 36:44.368
but nothing a drugged
fritter couldn't fix.

36:44.410 --> 36:46.329
I-I'll explain later.

36:46.370 --> 36:48.456
(growling)
It's rising, isn't it?

36:48.497 --> 36:51.167
Not it. Her.

36:51.209 --> 36:52.251
Wait, what?

36:52.293 --> 36:53.920
You know that thing you saw,

36:53.961 --> 36:55.963
in your vision, with
Sunny and the cauldron?

36:56.005 --> 36:57.924
It was just an illusion,
what she wanted

36:57.965 --> 36:59.967
the Unseen to think
she looked like.

37:00.009 --> 37:02.136
The Lost One
isn't some

37:02.178 --> 37:04.138
ancient monster.

37:04.180 --> 37:05.932
She's an original Charmed One.

Not exactly.

38:55.249 --> 38:56.667
Then why'd you come back?

38:56.709 --> 38:58.794
You said something about
the Day of the Fall.

38:58.836 --> 39:00.212
Where did you hear that?

39:00.254 --> 39:01.756
I told you, the tapes.

39:08.554 --> 39:10.348
Now show me what you've seen,

Fine.

MEL:
If you really are one of us,
why would you do all of this?

39:40.878 --> 39:43.839
Kill people,
ruin our reputation?

39:43.881 --> 39:45.925
I needed followers.

39:45.966 --> 39:50.012
And fear brings people together
much more easily than love.

39:50.054 --> 39:52.348
Don't waste your time
with her, Mel.

39:52.390 --> 39:54.183
If she wants a fight,
we'll give her one.

39:54.225 --> 39:56.977
Oh, I have no intention
of fighting any of you.

39:57.019 --> 39:58.020
You don't?

39:58.062 --> 40:00.940
(laughs)

40:00.981 --> 40:02.691
If I wanted you dead,

40:02.733 --> 40:05.736
I would have had
that ridiculous Tallyman do it.

40:05.778 --> 40:08.906
I didn't go to all these
lengths to start a war.

40:08.948 --> 40:12.368
I did it to end one.

40:12.410 --> 40:17.206
For thousands of years, I've
seen trios like you come and go.

40:17.248 --> 40:19.667
Sure, you'd settle little
conflicts here and there,

40:19.708 --> 40:21.168
vanquish the occasional
rogue demon,

40:21.210 --> 40:24.130
but you were always just
treating the symptoms.

40:24.171 --> 40:27.633
I want to cure the disease.

40:27.675 --> 40:28.968
Which is?

40:29.009 --> 40:32.346
A fundamental
imbalance of power.

40:32.388 --> 40:33.597
Your sister said
you tried to take

40:33.639 --> 40:35.433
the Source's power for yourself.

40:35.474 --> 40:36.809
She is not my sister!

40:38.727 --> 40:41.105
We were just three
witches who did a job

40:41.147 --> 40:43.315
together once.

40:45.818 --> 40:47.778
They mean nothing to me.

40:47.820 --> 40:50.406
What about those nine innocent
creatures you just killed?

40:50.448 --> 40:52.658
Do they mean
anything to you?

40:52.700 --> 40:55.536
They gave of themselves
willingly.

40:55.578 --> 40:56.745
You manipulated them.

40:56.787 --> 40:58.164
Enough!

40:59.290 --> 41:00.291
Maggie!

41:03.669 --> 41:05.087

41:07.047 --> 41:09.216
Power of Three.
Okay.

41:16.765 --> 41:18.767

41:26.609 --> 41:27.902

41:29.820 --> 41:33.199
There can only be
one true power.

41:33.240 --> 41:34.742
And by redoing
the ceremony

41:34.783 --> 41:37.661
that created it all
those years ago,

41:37.703 --> 41:41.790
that power is right back
where it belongs.

41:41.832 --> 41:43.792
Screw this.

41:43.834 --> 41:45.878
See you in paradise.
