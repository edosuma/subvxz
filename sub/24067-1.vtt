04:05.287 --> 04:06.618
It's Snufkin.

04:06.621 --> 04:07.986
Snufkin!

04:08.749 --> 04:09.784
Hello.

04:11.418 --> 04:13.329
Let's go down to the river.

04:13.336 --> 04:15.953
We'll build bark boats and let them sail away.

04:15.964 --> 04:18.581
I wonder where will the water take them.

04:18.591 --> 04:20.754
Perhaps to where heading on my journey.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.422
I'm leaving soon.

04:30.854 --> 04:33.972
Oh Snufkin, is it that time already?

04:33.982 --> 04:36.724
Why do you always go away in the autumn?

04:36.735 --> 04:39.227
I wanna explore some new trails,

04:41.615 --> 04:44.323
spend some time alone for a while.

04:44.326 --> 04:46.408
I need to miss ya a bit.

04:47.245 --> 04:51.705
It makes me sad that you, the sun, birds,

04:51.708 --> 04:54.917
the smell of chestnuts and berries and leaves,

04:54.920 --> 04:56.786
you all go away.

04:57.214 --> 04:58.704
I don't like winter.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.670
Everything has its time.

05:01.676 --> 05:04.213
You have your winter sleep
and I travel the world.

05:04.221 --> 05:05.962
- But...
- You'll see.

05:05.972 --> 05:07.588
Soon when spring comes,

05:07.599 --> 05:09.931
we'll sit side-by-side warming our backs

05:09.935 --> 05:12.097
in the early rays of the sun

05:13.522 --> 05:15.763
and you'll tell me
what you've been dreaming about

05:15.774 --> 05:17.936
all winter long.

05:17.943 --> 05:19.183
It's time.

05:21.404 --> 05:24.112
Sweet dreams, Moomintroll my dearest friend.

05:24.115 --> 05:26.277
- Goodbye.
- I'll miss you.

05:26.284 --> 05:27.524
Don't forget to come back.

05:27.536 --> 05:29.777
I'll be back I promise!

05:31.623 --> 05:35.412
Bye, Bye Snufkin.

05:41.675 --> 05:44.042
Spruce trees are the only trees

05:44.052 --> 05:46.965
that do not surrender to the upcoming winter.

05:47.681 --> 05:52.016
These evergreens do not yet know how important

05:52.018 --> 05:54.760
their role will be in this story.

05:58.859 --> 06:04.195
The smell of winter seeps
slowly into the Moominvalley.

06:08.743 --> 06:12.452
The chestnut trees can no longer hold on

06:12.455 --> 06:15.072
to their brown, rustling leaves.

06:21.339 --> 06:25.128
Every day the sun sinks below the horizon

06:25.135 --> 06:27.422
earlier than the day before.

06:31.266 --> 06:35.510
With every step, the Groke strides more boldly

06:35.520 --> 06:37.636
through the Moominvalley,

06:37.772 --> 06:41.390
spreading cold and frostiness.

06:47.115 --> 06:48.901
Winter is coming.

06:52.996 --> 06:55.784
Everything freezes slowly.

06:57.959 --> 07:00.496
It's time to say goodbye

07:00.503 --> 07:03.962
and start preparing for the coldness.

07:10.138 --> 07:13.005
Brr, it's so cold.

07:13.016 --> 07:16.554
Brr, I think the Groke must be nearby.

07:16.561 --> 07:19.474
Otherwise where could
this coldness be coming from?

07:19.481 --> 07:22.519
What if the Groke freezes the sun?

07:22.525 --> 07:25.608
What if the spring will never come back?

07:27.155 --> 07:30.614
Moominpappa, why are there so many leaves?

07:30.617 --> 07:32.528
Over the winter, the leaves will turn

07:32.535 --> 07:35.744
into compost for Mamma's roses.

07:35.747 --> 07:38.284
We could already smell winter in the air.

07:38.291 --> 07:40.908
We need to prepare well for the deep cold.

07:40.919 --> 07:42.956
Stow the boat, make preserves,

07:42.963 --> 07:45.546
bring in the peat and the wood.

07:45.548 --> 07:48.131
Why do we need winter at all?

07:48.134 --> 07:50.421
What if something or someone visits us

07:50.428 --> 07:53.546
while we're fast asleep
and we don't even know about it?

07:53.556 --> 07:56.093
Oh don't fret, my dear.

07:56.101 --> 07:58.559
The world would be far less interesting

07:58.561 --> 08:00.893
without such mysteries.

08:07.862 --> 08:11.696
I wonder what happens in the sea
during the winter.

08:15.662 --> 08:19.155
Pappa, what kinds of mysteries
were you talking about?

08:19.165 --> 08:21.452
You don't always need to travel far

08:21.459 --> 08:23.496
in order to see a whole new world

08:23.503 --> 08:25.995
full of the strangest creatures.

08:26.006 --> 08:29.590
Sometimes a new world
just appears ready to explore.

08:34.889 --> 08:38.222
For example, every spring in the bathing house

08:38.226 --> 08:40.183
we find a thank you letter.

08:40.186 --> 08:42.644
Really, who's it from?

08:43.188 --> 08:45.556
I do not know, Moomintroll.

08:54.159 --> 08:57.117
The mushrooms will grow big in this rain.

09:13.678 --> 09:16.340
Raspberry preserves, yes.

09:16.347 --> 09:18.839
Wild rose preserves, yes.

09:18.850 --> 09:21.592
Apple and plum preserves, yes,

09:21.603 --> 09:23.594
Needle cover for the soup?

09:23.605 --> 09:26.893
Oh no, we can't sleep
through the winter without that.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.141
- Darling?
- Yes, dear.

09:29.444 --> 09:31.731
Please run and get some spruce needle cover.

09:31.738 --> 09:34.446
The first snow might come any minute.

09:34.449 --> 09:35.689
Please, hurry.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.691
Mamma, there's no need to worry.

09:37.702 --> 09:39.818
We'll get everything done in time.

09:39.829 --> 09:41.570
And pick more mushrooms.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.117
We'll do them in vinegar.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.700
Pappa, come quick.

09:46.711 --> 09:48.827
The sun is about to set and the snow

09:48.838 --> 09:50.420
might start falling any second.

09:50.423 --> 09:53.506
I'm coming, Moomintroll, I'm coming.

09:53.510 --> 09:54.841
Be calm.

09:54.844 --> 09:56.755
There's nothing to fear,

09:58.348 --> 09:59.838
as far as I know.

09:59.849 --> 10:00.759
Huh?

10:05.897 --> 10:09.310
Mushrooms, endless amounts of mushrooms.

10:09.317 --> 10:11.934
We'll have our baskets filled in no time.

10:11.945 --> 10:16.564
One little one, one nice big juicy one.

10:16.574 --> 10:17.689
One...

10:17.700 --> 10:18.656
Huh?

10:18.827 --> 10:21.489
Pappa Pappa, I'm frightened.

10:21.496 --> 10:24.329
The wolves are howling so dreadfully.

10:24.332 --> 10:25.868
What do they want?

10:27.418 --> 10:29.659
Oh don't worry, they're gathering

10:29.671 --> 10:32.083
in the lonely mountains for the winter.

10:32.090 --> 10:34.707
There's no reason to be scared of wolves.

10:34.884 --> 10:37.626
Now as for the Lady of the Cold,

10:37.637 --> 10:39.719
she's beautiful beyond measure.

10:39.722 --> 10:42.680
Yet has a deadly freezing gaze.

10:44.227 --> 10:45.092
Yikes!

10:58.074 --> 11:00.691
Moominmamma is very pleased.

11:00.702 --> 11:04.912
The whole house smells
of warm wood and mushrooms.

11:08.126 --> 11:10.663
I am so happy we've had a bumper crop

11:10.670 --> 11:12.911
of mushrooms this year.

11:13.798 --> 11:16.290
Moominmamma, see what I found?

11:16.301 --> 11:17.917
This one is really big.

11:17.927 --> 11:20.464
Yes Moomintroll, it's a Whopper.

11:20.471 --> 11:22.838
How 'bout I dry it separately for you?

11:22.849 --> 11:23.839
Would you like that?

11:23.850 --> 11:26.387
On reflection, I much prefer eating mushrooms

11:26.394 --> 11:27.384
to picking them.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.607
That Moomintroll,

11:34.319 --> 11:36.777
he never thinks of anybody else but Snufkin.

11:36.779 --> 11:38.440
Never, never, never.

11:42.577 --> 11:44.159
He just ignores me.

11:50.335 --> 11:51.871
I know what I'll do.

11:51.878 --> 11:55.792
Forget mushrooms,
I'll bring him some toadstools.

11:56.633 --> 11:58.499
That'll make him angry
and give him something else

11:58.509 --> 12:00.420
to think about than Snufkin.

12:02.597 --> 12:04.554
Oh no, my roses.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.798
The Fosters nipped them.

12:07.769 --> 12:08.725
Look Mamma

12:08.728 --> 12:11.095
lots of mushrooms, a basket full.

12:13.316 --> 12:15.978
Gracious, those are toadstools.

12:15.985 --> 12:17.350
Why did you pick them, Little My?

12:17.362 --> 12:18.852
They're poisonous.

12:18.863 --> 12:19.944
They're for Moomintroll.

12:19.948 --> 12:22.110
Do you really want to poison him?

12:22.116 --> 12:23.777
No, no I...

12:23.785 --> 12:25.776
No, I just want to make him angry

12:25.787 --> 12:27.949
and stop thinking about Snufkin.

12:32.335 --> 12:36.670
Mamma I'm going outside
to look at the sun for a while.

12:36.881 --> 12:38.622
I wanna say goodbye to it.

12:42.845 --> 12:45.212
The shadows are growing longer.

12:45.848 --> 12:46.713
Oh.

12:51.145 --> 12:53.307
Snufkin is probably sitting,

12:53.314 --> 12:57.353
warming himself in the sun
and exploring unknown lands.

12:57.735 --> 13:00.102
Winter's just horrible.

13:09.706 --> 13:11.913
As the snow begins to fall,

13:11.916 --> 13:15.955
Moominmamma and Moominpappa
ready the Moominhouse

13:15.962 --> 13:18.124
for the long winter sleep.

13:24.637 --> 13:26.127
Ah, there we are.

13:31.436 --> 13:32.597
This one.

13:38.818 --> 13:41.355
A properly preheated stove is essential

13:41.362 --> 13:43.273
for a good winter's sleep.

13:43.281 --> 13:44.988
We brought so many spruce needles

13:44.991 --> 13:47.608
that we might sleep 'til the late spring.

13:47.618 --> 13:49.484
Everything's all set.

13:49.495 --> 13:52.283
Ready, gathered, tucked away.

13:52.290 --> 13:54.076
The pantry is full.

13:54.083 --> 13:57.792
We're warm and snug in our very own house.

13:58.338 --> 14:01.581
Mamma, is it time now to go to bed?

14:01.716 --> 14:04.834
The smell of winter and the evergreen forest

14:04.844 --> 14:08.303
wafts through the house one last time.

14:10.558 --> 14:11.514
Whoa.

14:11.851 --> 14:14.058
As the cold settles in,

14:14.062 --> 14:17.020
you can hear a gentle cracking of the walls.

14:17.023 --> 14:22.018
The sea lies asleep under ice,
under thick drifts of snow.

14:22.695 --> 14:25.278
Deep down among the roots of the Earth,

14:25.281 --> 14:27.989
all small creatures are asleep

14:27.992 --> 14:31.610
in their burrows dreaming of Spring.

14:32.038 --> 14:37.158
The silence is deep and expected.

14:39.587 --> 14:43.581
Well there's no doubt about it,
winter has arrived.

14:44.884 --> 14:48.377
Oh the Groke, she's on her chilly way.

14:48.388 --> 14:51.255
It's best not to look outside, darlings.

14:51.265 --> 14:53.973
Time for our winter sleep.

14:53.976 --> 14:56.764
Okay Mamma, I'm going up to bed.

14:56.854 --> 15:00.097
Just like every year,
we will Sleep all winter long

15:00.108 --> 15:03.226
with our bellies full of spruce needles.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.519
That's what our parents, grandparents

15:05.530 --> 15:07.988
and great grandparents did.

15:07.990 --> 15:09.731
Really Mamma?

15:10.868 --> 15:13.906
And where are all our ancestors now?

15:15.456 --> 15:17.163
I'm not sure.

15:17.166 --> 15:18.873
All I know is that they used to live

15:18.876 --> 15:20.287
behind the tiled stoves.

15:20.294 --> 15:22.205
Oh, that's not fair.

15:22.213 --> 15:24.454
I wish I could talk to the ancestors.

15:24.465 --> 15:27.048
There are millions of questions
I'd like to ask them.

15:27.051 --> 15:30.260
Well try not to think about it and go to sleep.

15:31.681 --> 15:34.389
Maybe I'll dream of something spring-like

15:34.392 --> 15:36.508
or a great adventure with Snufkin.

15:36.519 --> 15:38.510
123,

15:38.896 --> 15:40.933
124

15:40.940 --> 15:44.228
- What are you doing?
- I'm counting sheep,

15:44.235 --> 15:46.476
I can't seem to fall asleep.

15:46.487 --> 15:49.445
I think I should've put up
more rose hip preserves.

15:49.449 --> 15:52.362
Oh Mamma, the pantry shelves are sagging

15:52.368 --> 15:53.984
with all your preserves.

15:53.995 --> 15:57.704
125, 26.

16:01.586 --> 16:03.827
Goodnight, my darlings.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.798
All the clocks have stopped

16:08.801 --> 16:11.884
as if time is standing still.

16:12.388 --> 16:16.177
Specks of dust drift gently to the floor.

16:17.226 --> 16:21.641
The firewood smolders slowly in the tiled stove

16:21.647 --> 16:25.265
and all the sweet scents of summer
have disappeared

16:25.276 --> 16:28.860
tightly sealed in the jars of preserves.

16:29.322 --> 16:32.860
The snow blankets the landscape

16:33.159 --> 16:37.653
smoothing sharp angles into pillowy roundness.

16:38.247 --> 16:43.333
Every single twig in the wood
carries a large snowcap.

16:43.920 --> 16:49.040
A cold sparkle of snow falls
into Moomintr0ll's dream.

16:57.808 --> 17:02.427
Oh, so The sun sometimes appears
in The winter too.

17:03.523 --> 17:05.685
So fluffy and cold.

17:06.608 --> 17:07.815
Curious.

17:13.824 --> 17:15.609
There sure is a lot of it.

17:21.749 --> 17:24.286
It's so silent and empty.

17:25.836 --> 17:28.578
Pappa always says that
the world is calm and silent

17:28.589 --> 17:31.377
before something terrible happens.

17:31.384 --> 17:33.500
I wonder what to expect.

17:37.431 --> 17:39.638
I hope I meet someone.

17:39.642 --> 17:41.758
Can it be that I am the only one awake

17:41.769 --> 17:43.885
in all of Moominvalley?

17:43.896 --> 17:46.354
I'll go down to the seashore.

17:46.357 --> 17:49.566
The sound of the waves lapping
is always so comforting.

17:55.866 --> 17:57.152
Oh no!

17:57.159 --> 17:59.617
But there are no lapping waves.

17:59.620 --> 18:01.987
There's nobody at the frozen shore,

18:01.998 --> 18:04.956
not even the smallest little creature.

18:06.711 --> 18:09.874
Oh no, the sea is gone.

18:09.922 --> 18:12.209
It's frozen over.

18:12.216 --> 18:15.254
What has happened to the fish and the seaweed?

18:15.261 --> 18:19.596
Where are the shrimps and the seashells
I like to collect?

18:20.141 --> 18:21.723
There's no one here.

18:21.726 --> 18:23.763
Or, wait.

18:24.312 --> 18:27.395
Pappa talked about
a mysterious thank you letter.

18:28.482 --> 18:29.813
Interesting.

18:30.526 --> 18:34.064
Nobody's here, but the stove is warm.

18:40.578 --> 18:42.990
Oh, who's that?

18:43.247 --> 18:47.741
Is that the lady of the cold?

18:48.461 --> 18:51.169
Oh how beautiful she is.

18:51.172 --> 18:54.881
The most beautiful person I've ever seen.

18:57.470 --> 19:01.008
Brrr she carries cold with her.

19:07.688 --> 19:10.020
I wonder where she's going.

19:22.244 --> 19:23.860
Oh no!

19:24.038 --> 19:25.028
Ahh!

19:25.331 --> 19:26.992
She froze her.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.034
Froze her.

19:28.042 --> 19:29.032
Momma.

19:29.043 --> 19:32.161
Momma, I hate winter.

19:32.838 --> 19:35.876
You're dreaming of the lady of the cold too.

19:36.133 --> 19:37.544
I'll bring you some sun.

19:37.551 --> 19:39.883
Sleep Moomintroll.

19:39.887 --> 19:42.800
I have a box full of pictures in the attic.

19:42.807 --> 19:44.639
I hope I can find it.

19:52.983 --> 19:55.020
Must be here somewhere.

19:58.531 --> 19:59.987
Here it is.

19:59.990 --> 20:01.651
Beautiful sun.

20:01.951 --> 20:04.488
I found lots of stickers too.

20:04.620 --> 20:05.781
I'll make a pretty pattern

20:05.788 --> 20:08.951
over Momma's bed to give her sweet dreams.

20:16.716 --> 20:20.175
Attics are very useful especially in winter.

20:25.850 --> 20:27.557
She's alive?

20:27.810 --> 20:29.926
Is that the same squirrel?

20:29.937 --> 20:32.554
She has such a beautiful tail.

20:32.565 --> 20:36.024
You should find yourself
some warm shelter squirrel!

20:36.026 --> 20:37.733
The Moominhouse looks rather

20:37.737 --> 20:40.069
like a lopsided snow drift.

20:40.364 --> 20:42.605
And there are no footprints.

20:42.616 --> 20:45.904
Moomintroll feels very lonely.

20:49.957 --> 20:51.914
I'm so hungry.

20:51.917 --> 20:54.784
Oh, here's some bread.

20:54.795 --> 20:57.127
Momma must have left it out for me.

20:57.131 --> 20:58.838
How did she know?

20:59.925 --> 21:01.086
Mmm!

21:01.677 --> 21:04.044
Mmm!

21:04.054 --> 21:06.671
When bread is cold, it's crunchier.

21:07.308 --> 21:09.345
A little light will help me think.

21:13.063 --> 21:16.351
In this chair, I'll be just like Pappa.

21:17.193 --> 21:19.400
He would know what to do.

21:19.403 --> 21:20.893
It's such a cozy chair.

21:37.338 --> 21:39.124
Mmm what was I doing?

21:40.174 --> 21:41.380
That's right, a mattress.

21:41.383 --> 21:43.169
I need a new mattress.

21:44.929 --> 21:45.589
It's cold.

21:45.596 --> 21:47.587
It's too cold to stay in my den.

21:47.598 --> 21:49.714
I have to find a mattress.

21:49.725 --> 21:51.181
Oh, what was it?

21:54.772 --> 21:56.228
Oh yeah, a mattress.

21:56.232 --> 21:58.143
I must remember.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.685
That's weird.

22:02.822 --> 22:05.405
This cardboard box wasn't here before.

22:05.407 --> 22:07.444
Or am I in the wrong cave?

22:07.451 --> 22:09.067
Or am I the wrong squirrel?

22:09.078 --> 22:11.194
Oh that can't be the case.

22:11.831 --> 22:14.914
Just what I was looking for, warm wool.

22:14.917 --> 22:17.454
This will make a comfy mattress.

22:17.461 --> 22:20.419
It's almost as fluffy as my beautiful tail.

22:20.422 --> 22:21.787
Amazing.

22:22.341 --> 22:24.002
Ow ow ow, something bit my foot!

22:24.009 --> 22:25.044
Ow ow ow!

22:25.052 --> 22:26.542
You ugly squirrel.

22:26.554 --> 22:28.420
How dare you wake me up.

22:28.764 --> 22:31.426
Can't you see I'm sleeping here with my sister?

22:31.433 --> 22:32.844
Keep sleeping sister.

22:32.852 --> 22:34.183
I'll sort this out myself

22:34.186 --> 22:36.143
and I'll be back when I get too cold.

22:36.146 --> 22:37.136
Alright then.

22:40.276 --> 22:42.608
Mmm I see.

22:43.696 --> 22:46.063
So this is what snow looks like.

22:46.073 --> 22:48.030
The things they come up with.

22:50.536 --> 22:52.026
How crunchy.

22:52.037 --> 22:53.573
Who would have thought.

22:53.581 --> 22:56.164
Haha so much snow.

22:56.834 --> 22:59.041
You're still here ugly, squirrel.

23:03.340 --> 23:04.296
Thanks to you.

23:04.300 --> 23:05.836
Weeee!

23:06.093 --> 23:07.709
I'm wide awake.

23:12.391 --> 23:13.677
Woo hoo!

23:15.227 --> 23:17.343
And I want to play in the snow.

23:32.161 --> 23:36.496
This winter I will be
the fastest My sliding down the hill.

23:37.791 --> 23:40.203
Weeee!

23:50.304 --> 23:51.715
If you're playing outside

23:51.722 --> 23:53.963
why don't I go to sleep
in the warm in your cave?

23:53.974 --> 23:56.557
Fine, do whatever you want.

23:57.603 --> 23:59.139
I've got an idea.

23:59.813 --> 24:01.429
I'll wake up Moomintroll.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.397
He needs to play with me.

24:11.575 --> 24:13.316
Greetings little lady.

24:16.455 --> 24:19.243
What marvelous ski trails
you have in this valley.

24:19.249 --> 24:20.239
Well duh.

24:20.250 --> 24:21.240
Obviously.

24:21.251 --> 24:23.037
Our valley is the best.

24:23.045 --> 24:24.877
And who, pray tell, are you?

24:24.880 --> 24:26.587
I am Healthy Hemulin.

24:26.590 --> 24:30.174
I love winter and
I am an expert on snow conditions.

24:30.344 --> 24:33.462
Ah there's nothing better than
fresh air and exercise.

24:34.306 --> 24:35.592
You said it.

24:35.599 --> 24:37.840
Winter is absolutely amazing.

24:37.851 --> 24:38.716
How do you do?

24:38.727 --> 24:40.092
I'm Little My.

24:40.104 --> 24:42.846
And what are these boards
attached to your legs?

24:43.232 --> 24:44.722
These are skis.

24:45.234 --> 24:47.976
Don't tell me you've never heard of skis?

24:49.279 --> 24:52.647
They let you slide down really fast.

24:53.826 --> 24:55.408
<i>'</i> See?
<i>'</i> WOW!

24:55.411 --> 24:57.869
I need to get myself something like that.

24:58.747 --> 25:01.785
Now I'm off to wake up Moomintroll
from his winter sleep.

25:03.293 --> 25:04.374
What?

25:04.378 --> 25:06.710
How can you sleep all winter?

25:06.714 --> 25:08.796
Don't you know that if you sleep too long

25:08.799 --> 25:10.756
your bones and muscles get weaker?

25:10.759 --> 25:12.796
And the heart slows down.

25:14.471 --> 25:17.179
We need to save him from this great danger.

25:17.182 --> 25:19.924
If I may young lady I could wake him up myself.

25:21.103 --> 25:24.141
I didn't know winter sleep
could be that dangerous.

25:24.648 --> 25:26.309
Oh I'm getting hungry.

25:26.316 --> 25:28.227
Maybe the Moomins will prepare a feast.

25:28.235 --> 25:31.694
After all, Christmas is coming.

25:31.697 --> 25:32.812
Christmas?

25:33.115 --> 25:34.651
Who's Christmas?

25:35.367 --> 25:37.404
Such a peculiar valley.

25:37.411 --> 25:38.651
When Christmas comes,

25:38.662 --> 25:41.074
it's the most important event of the year.

25:41.415 --> 25:44.874
People gather with friends
and family and guests.

25:45.794 --> 25:47.125
There's lots of food.

25:47.129 --> 25:48.085
There are gifts.

25:48.088 --> 25:51.001
And best of all, there's a Christmas tree.

25:51.008 --> 25:52.999
I've never heard of Christmas.

25:53.010 --> 25:55.297
I bet the Moomin family haven't either.

25:55.512 --> 25:56.547
Presents?

25:56.555 --> 25:57.545
Guests?

25:57.556 --> 25:59.217
That's what I said.

25:59.224 --> 26:00.089
Wow!

26:00.142 --> 26:01.428
We'd better wake them all up

26:01.435 --> 26:03.301
so they can get ready for Christmas.

26:03.312 --> 26:05.269
How fast can you get there?

26:05.898 --> 26:09.061
Mmm Over fluffy snow with A Good wind behind me

26:09.068 --> 26:12.777
and mostly downhill,
I'd say I can be there in no time.

26:12.780 --> 26:14.316
Mmm well hurry.

26:14.323 --> 26:15.813
But don't mention Christmas.

26:15.824 --> 26:17.235
Let's keep it a surprise.

26:25.209 --> 26:26.950
Little My is right.

26:29.880 --> 26:31.962
We need to wake them up quickly.

26:32.466 --> 26:35.049
Thus it is my duty to wake them up.

26:35.052 --> 26:38.295
And a Hemulin always does his duty.

26:40.099 --> 26:41.305
Ohh!

26:42.059 --> 26:44.551
Why oh why did I agree to this?

26:44.561 --> 26:47.428
There's so much stuff here and it's all dusty.

26:47.731 --> 26:50.393
Mind you, it's a good thing
the attic is so cluttered.

26:51.276 --> 26:52.892
I might have hurt myself.

26:53.862 --> 26:57.025
Mmm mmmm.

27:01.411 --> 27:03.743
How can anyone hate winter so much

27:03.747 --> 27:05.829
that they want to sleep through it?

27:06.375 --> 27:08.207
Mmmm.

27:09.545 --> 27:10.080
Hello!

27:10.879 --> 27:12.085
Wa key wa key.

27:12.089 --> 27:13.329
Moomin!

27:15.676 --> 27:18.134
Moomin, Christmas is coming.

27:18.137 --> 27:21.721
Uh oh, I've never been good at keeping secrets.

27:22.432 --> 27:24.389
Oh get up.

27:27.020 --> 27:28.351
Who is that?

27:29.356 --> 27:31.768
You can't spend all winter sleeping.

27:31.775 --> 27:33.732
The weather is fantastic.

27:33.735 --> 27:34.896
Get ready.

27:34.987 --> 27:37.854
What's going on? Who are you?

27:37.865 --> 27:39.321
What Christmas were you talking about?

27:39.324 --> 27:40.985
I am healthy Hemulin.

27:40.993 --> 27:42.654
I came here to wake you up

27:42.661 --> 27:43.901
and to warn you.

27:43.912 --> 27:45.698
Mamma, Mamma.

27:45.706 --> 27:47.242
You have to get up.

27:47.249 --> 27:48.159
Gracious!

27:48.167 --> 27:49.703
What's going on?

27:49.710 --> 27:51.451
Everybody stay calm.

27:51.461 --> 27:53.122
Calm down.

27:53.130 --> 27:54.495
We can handle it.

27:54.506 --> 27:55.871
Hemulin.

27:55.883 --> 27:57.123
What Christmas?

27:57.134 --> 27:58.624
Just get ready.

27:58.635 --> 28:00.672
Christmas will soon be at the door.

28:00.679 --> 28:03.296
And here you all are fast asleep.

28:03.307 --> 28:04.763
And open some windows.

28:04.766 --> 28:07.224
Mamma someone's at the door.

28:07.227 --> 28:09.343
Someone called Christmas.

28:09.354 --> 28:11.140
We're not ready for guests.

28:11.148 --> 28:13.014
Especially Christmas.

28:13.025 --> 28:16.814
The world is full of great
and astonishing things

28:16.820 --> 28:18.902
waiting for those who are not ready.

28:18.906 --> 28:22.865
I am sure that
we'll give Christmas a warm welcome.

28:30.042 --> 28:31.783
I can't see anybody.

28:31.793 --> 28:33.033
No Hemulin.

28:33.045 --> 28:34.456
No Christmas.

28:35.505 --> 28:37.371
Oh snow!

28:37.382 --> 28:40.374
Look how everything sparkles

28:42.638 --> 28:45.801
like millions of little sunshines.

28:46.099 --> 28:47.931
I couldn't have said it better myself.

28:47.935 --> 28:50.017
Look, there's Gafsy.

28:50.020 --> 28:51.931
I wonder what she's up to?

28:52.356 --> 28:54.063
What's in the sleigh?

28:54.066 --> 28:56.774
Oh it looks like presents.

28:59.571 --> 29:01.983
Oh, how exciting.

29:01.990 --> 29:03.606
What could this mean?

29:04.743 --> 29:06.905
Moomins, better Just have Your Christmas tree

29:06.912 --> 29:09.324
and wrap your presents
or you won't be ready in time.

29:09.331 --> 29:11.163
Christmas is almost here.

29:11.166 --> 29:12.281
What?

29:12.292 --> 29:15.455
We need a tree to protect us from Christmas?

29:16.338 --> 29:18.375
I wonder, does it have to be large enough

29:18.382 --> 29:20.749
for us all to hide underneath?

29:20.759 --> 29:23.717
Mmm and we need to have some gifts.

29:23.720 --> 29:25.802
And a feast.

29:31.270 --> 29:33.762
Good morning, Fillyjonk.

29:33.772 --> 29:35.979
So are you ready for Christmas?

29:35.983 --> 29:39.396
Oh dear Oh dear Mrs Gafsy,
I have run out of time.

29:39.403 --> 29:41.269
I'm rushing home to prepare the food.

29:41.280 --> 29:43.988
I'm expecting guests at any moment.

29:51.331 --> 29:52.992
Anybody home?

29:53.542 --> 29:54.953
How did you get here?

29:54.960 --> 29:56.075
You're upstairs.

29:56.253 --> 29:57.368
There're so much snow

29:57.379 --> 29:59.666
and I can barely see your house.

30:00.340 --> 30:03.298
Open up please, I have a gift for you.

30:03.760 --> 30:06.548
Good to see you on this special day.

30:06.972 --> 30:08.212
Likewise.

30:08.223 --> 30:11.215
Oh oh, you're not nearly ready.

30:11.226 --> 30:11.931
Here.

30:11.935 --> 30:14.643
Not good, not good, but they do say

30:14.646 --> 30:17.855
the most important thing is being together.

30:17.858 --> 30:19.519
Well goodbye now.

30:20.569 --> 30:22.059
Who sent it?

30:22.070 --> 30:23.652
What could it be?

30:23.655 --> 30:25.271
How exciting!

30:25.282 --> 30:27.193
Maybe it's a gift from Snufkin.

30:27.200 --> 30:28.782
Well let's open it.

30:29.119 --> 30:30.985
I love surprises.

30:34.916 --> 30:36.873
Oh well, I'll be!

30:38.628 --> 30:41.746
Hello there, happy to see you.

30:41.757 --> 30:44.340
Nibling, this is unexpected.

30:44.343 --> 30:46.710
Why have you come to visit us, Nibling?

30:48.013 --> 30:49.253
My mom was busy

30:49.264 --> 30:50.800
and I was getting on her nerves.

30:50.807 --> 30:53.845
But I heard that you're hosting a great feast.

30:55.854 --> 30:58.892
Please don't jump on the beds, Nibling.

30:59.941 --> 31:00.681
What's that?

31:00.692 --> 31:03.059
I can't hear you when I'm jumping on the beds.

31:03.111 --> 31:04.943
Haha weeee!

31:04.946 --> 31:06.152
<i>Hares a note.</i>

31:06.156 --> 31:07.612
I'm sending him to you

31:07.616 --> 31:08.822
because I know that you

31:08.825 --> 31:11.157
will take good care of him.

31:13.497 --> 31:16.615
I knew I should have made more preserves.

31:16.833 --> 31:18.665
What should we do to prepare?

31:18.668 --> 31:21.251
Moomintroll, you go to the bathing house

31:21.254 --> 31:23.416
and try to find some more plates.

31:23.423 --> 31:26.290
We'll have to cook a lot of food for the feast.

31:26.301 --> 31:29.043
Meanwhile I'll take Nibling to Fillyjonk

31:29.054 --> 31:31.512
and find out about this Christmas.

31:31.932 --> 31:33.218
We also need to find someone

31:33.225 --> 31:35.091
to find the tree for Christmas.

31:35.102 --> 31:37.309
Ah such a task demands someone

31:37.312 --> 31:40.225
really brave, resourceful and clever.

31:40.232 --> 31:43.099
But where will we find someone like that?

31:43.110 --> 31:46.603
Of course it's a task just right for Pappa.

31:46.613 --> 31:49.401
I'm sure he'll find a perfect tree.

31:49.866 --> 31:51.402
I'm off to discover everything

31:51.410 --> 31:53.401
I can about Christmas.

31:55.288 --> 31:57.154
We'll find a solution Mamma.

31:57.165 --> 31:58.655
We always do.

32:00.544 --> 32:02.626
Little Nibling, don't worry.

32:02.629 --> 32:05.496
I have a perfect sense of direction.

32:05.507 --> 32:07.919
This is what mothers always do

32:07.926 --> 32:10.634
when faced with difficult challenges.

32:10.637 --> 32:12.628
Nothing can stop them.

32:16.184 --> 32:18.801
Oh I'll set this one here.

32:19.438 --> 32:22.647
And move this over here.

32:23.442 --> 32:27.026
Oh I don't see anyone approaching.

32:30.907 --> 32:33.740
Oh after all my weeks of preparation

32:33.743 --> 32:37.202
I'm afraid nobody is coming for the holidays.

32:38.999 --> 32:40.034
Guests?

32:42.335 --> 32:44.827
Moominmamma, what brings you here?

32:44.838 --> 32:46.169
Please come in.

32:46.173 --> 32:47.163
Thank you.

32:49.134 --> 32:52.047
Now to what do I owe the honor?

32:53.096 --> 32:55.383
I want to ask about Christmas.

32:55.390 --> 32:57.427
What should we do, Fillyjonk?

32:57.434 --> 32:59.425
How can we save ourselves?

32:59.436 --> 33:03.395
We have medicine, bandages, candles, hatchets

33:03.398 --> 33:05.935
Pappa's out looking for the Christmas tree now.

33:05.942 --> 33:07.774
As we understand it's helpful to have it

33:07.777 --> 33:09.267
before Christmas comes.

33:09.279 --> 33:11.111
Oh you don't understand.

33:11.114 --> 33:12.980
The most important thing is food

33:12.991 --> 33:14.231
and lots of it.

33:14.242 --> 33:15.858
Oh and you have to clean.

33:15.869 --> 33:17.576
Everything must be spotless.

33:19.122 --> 33:21.614
Goodness gracious, I must rush home.

33:21.625 --> 33:23.207
We need to clean.

33:23.210 --> 33:24.871
And remember, you're supposed to

33:24.878 --> 33:26.368
dress up the Christmas tree.

33:26.379 --> 33:28.370
It must look beautiful.

33:30.300 --> 33:33.167
Oh what a naughty creature!

33:33.178 --> 33:35.545
He needs to leave my house this instant!

33:35.555 --> 33:38.138
I spent a whole week cleaning this room alone.

33:38.141 --> 33:39.381
Come Nibling.

33:39.392 --> 33:41.884
I'm sorry for the mess, Fillyjonk.

33:41.895 --> 33:44.057
And thank you for all your advice.

33:44.064 --> 33:45.225
We'll be off.

33:45.232 --> 33:48.190
I'm sure your guests will be arriving soon.

33:48.652 --> 33:49.813
No.

33:49.819 --> 33:51.685
Nobody's coming.

33:52.239 --> 33:55.652
Oh dear, Well in that case, Please come to us.

33:55.659 --> 33:57.241
It may be a little haphazard

33:57.244 --> 33:59.827
but we'll be safer if we're all together.

33:59.829 --> 34:00.534
Thank you.

34:00.539 --> 34:02.325
I'll be there, promise.

34:02.332 --> 34:03.288
Bye bye.

34:08.463 --> 34:12.878
So Christmas likes A spotless house
and lots of food.

34:17.013 --> 34:19.880
But how will we dress up the Christmas tree?

34:19.891 --> 34:22.724
If it's a big tree, I'm not sure I can find

34:22.726 --> 34:24.809
clothes large enough to fit.

34:25.105 --> 34:26.186
Here dear.

34:30.277 --> 34:32.860
Perhaps Pappa will choose a small tree

34:33.280 --> 34:36.362
and we'll dress it up in one of my dresses.

34:57.596 --> 35:01.510
Pappa told me that
The lady of The cold is Just A legend.

35:01.600 --> 35:06.015
But I had a real dream about her,
so maybe she does exist.

35:06.521 --> 35:09.479
Why did I never hear about Christmas?

35:10.066 --> 35:13.650
Snufkin's right, there's so much to explore.

35:13.653 --> 35:15.815
So many things we don't understand.

35:30.045 --> 35:33.583
Last time I was here,
Snufkin and I went swimming

35:33.590 --> 35:36.048
and they'll lay in the warm sand.

35:36.426 --> 35:37.962
Is somebody here?

35:38.219 --> 35:39.835
It's so warm inside.

35:40.305 --> 35:41.261
Huh?

35:42.349 --> 35:43.714
Anybody there?

35:56.738 --> 35:59.321
Oh no, how did this happen?

36:00.116 --> 36:01.823
Why did you let him go?

36:01.826 --> 36:04.944
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

36:04.954 --> 36:07.946
It's all because of this Christmas thing.

36:07.957 --> 36:09.413
And what's your name?

36:09.417 --> 36:10.782
Pappa said that someone leaves

36:10.794 --> 36:12.910
a letter in here every spring.

36:12.921 --> 36:14.252
Is that you?

36:14.255 --> 36:15.666
Do you live here all winter?

36:15.674 --> 36:18.757
Yes I do; I know who you are.

36:18.760 --> 36:20.592
You're Moomintroll.

36:21.012 --> 36:22.878
My name is Too-Ticky.

36:22.889 --> 36:25.301
But this is Pappa's bathing house.

36:25.308 --> 36:27.219
I used to dive from here.

36:27.227 --> 36:28.558
The sea was warm.

36:28.561 --> 36:31.019
You may be right and you may be wrong.

36:31.022 --> 36:33.639
In the summer, it belongs to a Pappa.

36:33.650 --> 36:36.768
In winter, it belongs to Too-Ticky.

36:37.404 --> 36:39.645
What was that creature?

36:39.656 --> 36:41.988
Your ancestor, family.

36:42.200 --> 36:43.656
My ancestor?

36:43.660 --> 36:44.695
Family?

36:44.703 --> 36:46.740
- Are you sure?
- Yup.

36:46.746 --> 36:49.238
He didn't look anything like me.

36:49.249 --> 36:52.412
Family is family; you don't get to choose it.

36:52.419 --> 36:55.127
But it's very important around Christmas.

36:55.130 --> 36:58.839
That was your great, great, great grandfather.

37:03.680 --> 37:04.966
What's going on?

37:04.973 --> 37:07.385
Those are invisible shrews.

37:07.392 --> 37:10.100
A lot of amazing creatures
appear in the winter.

37:10.687 --> 37:12.644
Creatures that are afraid to show themselves

37:12.647 --> 37:14.433
in spring or summer.

37:16.776 --> 37:19.894
Listen, the point of Christmas
is about being with others,

37:22.866 --> 37:24.698
When you all sit around the table together

37:24.701 --> 37:26.567
eating a festive meal.

37:27.996 --> 37:31.079
You know more about my ancestors than I do.

37:31.332 --> 37:32.914
I need to find him.

37:32.917 --> 37:36.000
I'm gonna run now, but I'll be back.

37:36.004 --> 37:37.995
I have so many questions.

37:38.923 --> 37:40.880
Word of advice, young fellow.

37:40.884 --> 37:42.841
Relatives have a tendency to stay

37:42.844 --> 37:44.881
somewhat longer than you want them to.

37:45.054 --> 37:47.466
Okay, thanks.

37:47.474 --> 37:48.555
Bye bye.

37:53.062 --> 37:55.178
Moomintroll runs home

37:55.190 --> 37:58.023
and straight up to the attic
where he feels sure

37:58.026 --> 38:01.894
to find answers to his many questions
about his ancestors.

38:01.905 --> 38:03.737
I bet he hid in the attic.

38:03.740 --> 38:06.573
He'd feel right at home
with all this old stuff.

38:12.207 --> 38:14.539
Ooh, the family album.

38:14.542 --> 38:17.375
Maybe I'll find a family resemblance in here.

38:25.845 --> 38:28.086
But I don't look anything
like the long-tailed creature

38:28.097 --> 38:29.679
in the cupboard.

38:34.896 --> 38:38.059
It is not true, or could it be?

38:38.233 --> 38:41.521
After all, he did have a fringe on his tail

38:41.528 --> 38:43.018
just like me.

38:43.780 --> 38:46.272
Hmm, I don't know.

38:47.242 --> 38:48.903
Maybe a bit.

38:51.871 --> 38:52.906
Huh?

38:55.667 --> 38:59.001
Hi, great great great grandfather.

38:59.003 --> 39:00.289
Come down.

39:00.839 --> 39:02.125
Don't be scared.

39:02.131 --> 39:04.964
Will you join us to wait for Christmas?

39:05.718 --> 39:07.709
You'll meet all the others.

39:12.308 --> 39:15.346
That's Fillyjonk, don't worry.

39:15.353 --> 39:17.185
She's not related to us.

39:17.188 --> 39:18.678
I don't like her much either.

39:18.690 --> 39:20.772
She doesn't understand that sometimes,

39:20.775 --> 39:23.312
a little bit of chaos is necessary.

39:23.319 --> 39:25.060
Now I can see you're family.

39:25.071 --> 39:29.156
The ancestors of Moomins
used to live behind tiled stones

39:29.242 --> 39:30.824
just like you.

39:30.827 --> 39:34.411
You hate alarm clocks, just like me.

39:35.957 --> 39:36.947
Hey!

39:36.958 --> 39:39.040
Fearing that Fillyjonk is coming,

39:39.043 --> 39:42.286
the ancestor scurries into the chimney to hide.

40:12.785 --> 40:15.152
Huh, who can that be?

40:18.041 --> 40:20.328
Oh no, what if it's Christmas?

40:20.335 --> 40:23.077
We're not ready;
we don't have our Christmas tree yet.

40:23.087 --> 40:24.953
Hello there, Moomintroll.

40:25.340 --> 40:27.047
Welcome, Hemulen.

40:27.175 --> 40:29.837
What are those sticks attached to your feet?

40:29.844 --> 40:31.881
These are skis.

40:31.888 --> 40:35.131
Little My said I could invite
as many guests as I like.

40:35.808 --> 40:39.642
I met Fillyjonk,
the Wompers and Salome on the way.

40:39.646 --> 40:41.307
So they're all coming.

40:41.314 --> 40:43.897
We'll all prepare for Christmas together.

40:44.776 --> 40:48.235
After all, it's the most important
night of the year.

40:48.613 --> 40:51.605
Um, do we need that much help?

40:51.616 --> 40:53.277
We might not have room for everybody.

40:53.284 --> 40:54.900
You can thank me later.

40:54.911 --> 40:57.653
Now, let's get the house ready.

40:57.664 --> 41:00.247
I shall stay out here and blow my horn

41:00.249 --> 41:03.162
so all the guests will find their way easily.

41:04.379 --> 41:07.838
Okay, But I can use some help in The house.

41:08.716 --> 41:10.707
I'll have to make up beds for everyone.

41:13.137 --> 41:14.719
Don't worry about me.

41:14.722 --> 41:18.056
I shall be sleeping in a snow house outside.

41:18.059 --> 41:19.424
It's much healthier.

41:27.652 --> 41:31.111
Alright everyone, here's what we should do.

41:31.114 --> 41:36.109
We are going to build a snow house just for me.

41:37.036 --> 41:38.492
A big one.

41:39.956 --> 41:41.663
Why do you need a big house?

41:41.666 --> 41:42.997
I want fresh air.

41:43.001 --> 41:45.459
Lots of fresh, healthy air.

41:45.461 --> 41:48.044
Believe you me, nothing is more dangerous

41:48.047 --> 41:50.630
than spending too much time indoors.

41:50.675 --> 41:53.167
Now, it's time to get to work.

42:02.103 --> 42:04.470
But why a house of snow?

42:04.480 --> 42:06.562
He lives in his own bubble.

42:07.859 --> 42:09.941
Oh, this is a big one.

42:11.112 --> 42:13.695
Goodness, that's quite large enough.

42:13.865 --> 42:14.821
There we are.

42:14.824 --> 42:17.737
A little bit more, A little bit Too The right.

42:17.744 --> 42:19.360
Very good, bravo.

42:19.370 --> 42:21.281
Splendid work!

42:24.417 --> 42:26.408
Whoa, that's amazing.

42:26.419 --> 42:28.911
The snow house is ready and I'm hungry.

42:28.921 --> 42:32.084
Let's go to the Moominhouse
and have something to eat.

42:32.091 --> 42:34.583
Run along, I will join you later.

42:34.594 --> 42:37.052
So Fillyjonk, the Wonkers and Salome

42:37.055 --> 42:39.262
make their way to the Moominhouse,

42:39.265 --> 42:41.256
but the can't find the door.

42:41.267 --> 42:43.383
Come, here.

42:43.394 --> 42:45.055
This is the way in.

42:47.815 --> 42:50.398
Climb the ladder, I'll hold it steady.

42:50.401 --> 42:51.857
It's perfectly safe.

42:51.861 --> 42:54.694
I am not climbing any ladders.

42:54.697 --> 42:56.984
Please come, I'll help you.

42:57.158 --> 42:58.068
Come on.

42:58.076 --> 42:58.986
Certainly not.

42:58.993 --> 43:00.734
Do I look like a squirrel?

43:01.370 --> 43:03.407
Hang on, hang on.

43:05.083 --> 43:07.324
I will clear the snow off for you.

43:11.714 --> 43:14.251
Yeah, that's better.

43:15.551 --> 43:16.712
Here you go.

43:22.892 --> 43:23.848
Woo!

43:29.065 --> 43:31.181
In the silence of Winter,

43:31.192 --> 43:35.231
it's always wise to expect the unexpected.

43:35.822 --> 43:37.813
On this particular day,

43:37.824 --> 43:40.782
another stranger arrives in Moominvalley.

43:40.785 --> 43:44.870
A skinny, little dog with a wooly hat
over his eyes.

43:44.872 --> 43:47.204
His name is Sorry-00.

43:56.134 --> 43:58.717
I wonder how they'll treat me.

43:58.719 --> 44:01.586
A homeless, hungry dog like Sorry-00.

44:01.597 --> 44:03.179
Little My said that there's always

44:03.182 --> 44:05.423
lots of food at the Moominhouse.

44:05.434 --> 44:07.391
I haven't eaten for days.

44:09.856 --> 44:11.472
Isn't he cold?

44:11.941 --> 44:13.477
Strange man.

44:26.289 --> 44:30.704
This must be the Moominhouse, I've made it!

44:33.087 --> 44:33.997
Huh?

44:37.133 --> 44:40.751
The house has grown so cold
that we need more wood.

44:44.098 --> 44:46.009
This is almost enough for now.

44:46.017 --> 44:47.428
Let's get it inside.

44:48.853 --> 44:50.639
- Hello?
- Hi there,

44:50.646 --> 44:51.932
have you come a long way?

44:51.939 --> 44:54.681
Yes, I set out two days ago.

44:54.692 --> 44:55.306
Oh!

44:55.318 --> 44:59.152
I heard there's going to be a feast

44:59.155 --> 45:01.567
and I have nothing left to eat.

45:01.574 --> 45:03.906
Well, we have plenty of food.

45:03.910 --> 45:04.991
Come in.

45:09.373 --> 45:11.159
Here, I'll help you.

45:11.167 --> 45:13.124
The door is blocked up with snow,

45:13.127 --> 45:15.334
so we go in through the window.

45:15.338 --> 45:17.045
Come in, please.

45:17.131 --> 45:18.087
Guests first.

45:18.090 --> 45:19.580
You're very kind.

45:20.426 --> 45:21.587
Who's that?

45:21.969 --> 45:23.425
Ha, oh it's you!

45:23.429 --> 45:24.464
Glad you made it.

45:24.472 --> 45:26.258
There's lots of food, come on in.

45:27.850 --> 45:29.682
Dinner is served.

45:29.685 --> 45:31.892
I see that Moominmamma's been busy.

45:31.896 --> 45:33.728
I do love soup.

45:35.441 --> 45:37.273
Come, you can sit here.

45:37.944 --> 45:39.400
There's a free spot here.

45:39.403 --> 45:41.110
Make yourself at home.

45:45.701 --> 45:47.533
If you're gonna gobble it up that quick,

45:47.536 --> 45:49.118
there'll be nothing left for me.

45:49.121 --> 45:52.239
Mmm, now that's a tasty soup.

45:52.250 --> 45:55.584
Maybe I'll invite my brothers,
the wolves to the feast.

45:57.088 --> 45:58.203
Wolves?

45:58.214 --> 46:00.672
The wolves live in the lonely mountains.

46:00.675 --> 46:03.758
As far as I know, they are dangerous and wild.

46:03.761 --> 46:05.718
But I bet they're hungry.

46:05.721 --> 46:08.509
I don't think they're that much into preserves.

46:08.516 --> 46:10.223
Are you sure they're your brothers?

46:10.226 --> 46:11.637
Sure, I'm sure.

46:11.644 --> 46:13.851
They're strong and brave.

46:13.854 --> 46:15.811
My brothers would never harm.

46:15.815 --> 46:17.180
I wouldn't count on that.

46:17.191 --> 46:19.603
I never heard of anyone
who survived an encounter

46:19.610 --> 46:20.475
with the wolves.

46:20.486 --> 46:22.898
I'm sure they won't do anything bad.

46:22.905 --> 46:26.364
I like them, so why wouldn't they like me too?

46:26.367 --> 46:27.983
Go for it, invite them.

46:28.536 --> 46:29.697
Here you go.

46:30.246 --> 46:32.533
And now, Cranberry dessert.

46:32.540 --> 46:34.656
One of M0ominmamma's specialties.

46:34.667 --> 46:36.704
- Thank you, Little My.
- Thanks.

46:38.170 --> 46:39.877
Yum, yum.

46:41.841 --> 46:42.376
Huh?

46:42.383 --> 46:43.839
Greetings, friends.

46:44.343 --> 46:47.256
I see, are you just sitting inside?

46:47.263 --> 46:49.675
How about a little exercise?

46:49.682 --> 46:53.050
Fresh air does wonders for the Constitution.

46:53.060 --> 46:54.971
Unless there's any of that scrumptious

46:54.979 --> 46:57.061
Raspberry preserve left.

46:57.064 --> 46:59.180
I'm hungry all of a sudden.

46:59.191 --> 47:01.273
Why am I not surprised?

47:01.277 --> 47:03.860
Please, come in and help yourself Hemulen.

47:04.280 --> 47:05.190
A dog.

47:05.197 --> 47:07.438
Excellent, I've always liked dogs.

47:07.450 --> 47:10.238
And without a doubt, you at least love to run.

47:10.244 --> 47:11.905
Come outside with me.

47:11.912 --> 47:14.950
I'm going to the lonely mountains
to invite my brothers.

47:14.957 --> 47:17.949
Nothing I like more than fresh mountain air.

47:17.960 --> 47:19.496
I shall accompany you.

47:19.503 --> 47:21.915
However, we must hurry
for to make it there and back

47:21.922 --> 47:23.083
before the evening.

47:23.090 --> 47:24.455
We'll be waiting.

47:24.467 --> 47:26.549
Just come back by nightfall.

47:26.802 --> 47:28.588
Hemulen has always dreamt

47:28.596 --> 47:31.930
of having a loyal friend and travel companion.

47:31.932 --> 47:33.923
Meeting a dog in the Moomin house

47:33.934 --> 47:38.178
makes him extremely happy for a Hemulen.

47:40.775 --> 47:43.642
You know, I met a wolf once.

47:43.652 --> 47:46.565
Let me tell you,
you don't look much like a wolf.

47:46.572 --> 47:48.062
You're a nice, little dog.

47:48.074 --> 47:49.985
But I am brave.

47:49.992 --> 47:51.824
- In fact...
- If you say so.

47:51.827 --> 47:53.659
- I, uh...
- But fear not,

47:53.662 --> 47:57.405
I shall take care of you
and we will travel together.

47:58.084 --> 48:01.418
This Hemulen character's nothing but talk.

48:01.420 --> 48:03.206
He doesn't listen at all.

48:03.214 --> 48:04.704
We will go this way.

48:04.715 --> 48:05.921
Follow me.

48:12.014 --> 48:13.846
Get up now, let's go.

48:13.849 --> 48:15.260
We shall wander the world together

48:15.267 --> 48:17.224
having great adventures.

48:18.229 --> 48:19.560
Look at him go.

48:20.689 --> 48:22.726
I'll be better off myself.

48:23.150 --> 48:25.312
He wasn't a good companion.

48:25.319 --> 48:27.856
I'm sure I will make friends with the wolves.

48:27.863 --> 48:31.072
After all, they are family.

48:31.075 --> 48:33.237
I am a superb companion.

48:33.244 --> 48:36.487
I can be caring, resourceful and hardworking.

48:38.624 --> 48:39.580
What?

48:40.501 --> 48:41.866
Where did he go?

48:43.045 --> 48:46.504
Moominmamma is so absorbed in her work

48:46.507 --> 48:49.795
that she hardly seems aware
of the world around her.

48:49.802 --> 48:53.466
It's as if she disappears
into the task at hand,

48:53.472 --> 48:57.056
like the colors that disappear in winter.

48:59.228 --> 49:02.186
But as usual when something is missing,

49:02.189 --> 49:03.930
you have to stay calm

49:03.941 --> 49:06.774
and look in the right place to find it.

49:26.255 --> 49:29.748
Everybody is preparing
for the most important guest

49:29.758 --> 49:32.295
of all: Christmas.

50:01.457 --> 50:03.494
<i>Moomwxpappa, $109'-!</i>

50:05.461 --> 50:06.917
Whoa!

50:10.132 --> 50:13.215
Ooh, I've made an even bigger mess.

50:13.219 --> 50:15.881
Perhaps I'll be of more use in the kitchen.

50:20.559 --> 50:24.177
This Christmas business
is making me so nervous.

50:24.188 --> 50:25.599
Darling thank you for helping,

50:25.606 --> 50:27.643
but we still don't have a tree

50:27.650 --> 50:30.984
and we absolutely must have
one to welcome Christmas.

50:30.986 --> 50:34.069
Ooh, oh the tree.

50:34.073 --> 50:37.031
I do wish I were more organized.

50:37.576 --> 50:38.691
Where is it?

50:38.702 --> 50:40.067
Aah, here.

50:40.120 --> 50:44.159
Now, my grandmother's recipe for fish pie.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.958
Sit down a moment dear,
I'll finish the cooking.

50:47.962 --> 50:51.921
I'm sure Christmas will be
very hungry after a long journey.

51:00.849 --> 51:02.556
Are you alright, dear?

51:03.310 --> 51:05.051
Oh Yes Yes yes.

51:05.563 --> 51:07.145
I just need a moment.

51:12.736 --> 51:14.477
I believe there's a book that can tell me

51:14.488 --> 51:17.446
what a Christmas tree looks like
and where to find one.

51:18.409 --> 51:20.650
Hmm, it'll be up in the attic.

51:21.537 --> 51:23.403
What's Moominpappa up to?

51:24.248 --> 51:26.615
Oh I do like having an attic

51:26.625 --> 51:29.287
where we can store
all the seemingly useless things

51:29.295 --> 51:32.128
that save our lives from time-to-time.

51:35.926 --> 51:40.136
Oh, I keep telling Moominmamma
we must get organized.

51:40.973 --> 51:43.180
Now, where do I look?

51:43.642 --> 51:45.053
I try over here.

51:45.060 --> 51:46.141
Aha!

51:48.314 --> 51:50.646
Aah, here we are.

51:51.066 --> 51:52.977
Alright then, Chris...

51:52.985 --> 51:55.192
Oh, oh glasses.

51:57.698 --> 52:00.861
Christmas trees are conifers
which are evergreen.

52:00.868 --> 52:02.154
They symbolize life.

52:02.161 --> 52:05.495
A Christmas tree can be
a Spruce tree, a Pine tree.

52:05.497 --> 52:08.615
A tree stolen from nature

52:08.626 --> 52:11.459
will bring good luck to the household.

52:11.462 --> 52:13.203
I need to steal a tree!

52:13.213 --> 52:16.422
Just think of it as bringing it
in from The cold.

52:16.634 --> 52:17.999
Excellent idea, dear.

52:18.010 --> 52:19.216
Oh, thank you.

52:21.805 --> 52:23.341
Gifts, gifts.

52:23.349 --> 52:25.886
Everybody likes gifts.

52:25.893 --> 52:29.978
But what kind of gift
do you give to somebody you don't know

52:29.980 --> 52:32.221
and are even a little afraid of?

52:34.401 --> 52:38.110
Moomintroll has a challenging task
in front of him.

52:52.628 --> 52:54.835
What would make Christmas happy?

52:55.547 --> 52:57.834
I wonder what Christmas looks like.

52:58.300 --> 52:59.290
Whoa.

53:07.309 --> 53:09.516
Maybe she looks like a ghost.

53:12.898 --> 53:15.185
Or like a fortuneteller.

53:20.030 --> 53:22.738
Or like a beautiful seahorse.

53:27.913 --> 53:29.495
What is that light?

53:29.915 --> 53:32.327
It's so pretty and sparkly.

53:46.932 --> 53:48.138
Stuck.

54:05.284 --> 54:07.525
I think I'll go ask Too-Ticky.

54:07.536 --> 54:09.573
Maybe she knows Christmas better.

54:22.551 --> 54:25.509
Too-Ticky I was looking for you.

54:25.929 --> 54:27.340
What is this?

54:27.347 --> 54:29.258
It's a snow lantern.

54:29.266 --> 54:31.507
I was wondering
who would emerge from that forest.

54:31.518 --> 54:33.725
I guess it was you I was waiting for.

54:33.979 --> 54:37.893
Oh wow, what's that song you were whistling?

54:37.900 --> 54:39.811
It's a song about myself.

54:39.818 --> 54:42.731
A song of Too-Ticky who built a snow lantern.

54:43.363 --> 54:44.444
I see.

54:44.823 --> 54:46.109
No you don't

54:46.116 --> 54:47.572
because the refrain is about things

54:47.576 --> 54:50.944
no one can understand
and that may not even exist.

54:51.205 --> 54:53.412
Like the Northern Lights for instance.

54:53.415 --> 54:57.830
Hmm, I think The Northern Lights might exist.

54:57.836 --> 55:02.831
Hmm, or maybe they just look like existing.

55:02.883 --> 55:05.591
All things are so very uncertain.

55:05.594 --> 55:08.677
And that's exactly
what makes me feel reassured.

55:10.307 --> 55:12.423
I came lookin' for you

55:12.434 --> 55:15.347
because I need to make
some gifts for Christmas,

55:15.354 --> 55:17.095
but I have no clue what.

55:17.105 --> 55:18.846
Well, think about it.

55:18.857 --> 55:20.939
What would you like to receive?

55:21.693 --> 55:23.980
Well, I don't know.

55:25.322 --> 55:27.984
The sun went away and the winter

55:27.991 --> 55:31.029
is too mysterious and unpredictable.

55:31.036 --> 55:33.243
The thing I want most in the whole wide world

55:33.247 --> 55:35.909
is to see the sun again.

55:40.087 --> 55:41.498
You're in luck.

55:41.505 --> 55:43.837
Every year we light a special bonfire

55:43.841 --> 55:45.172
together with all the invisible

55:45.175 --> 55:47.337
and mysterious creatures of the valley.

55:47.344 --> 55:49.255
Today is the day.

55:49.263 --> 55:51.345
You can help us gather wood.

55:51.348 --> 55:53.715
These are the longest nights of the year.

55:53.725 --> 55:56.012
The fire will encourage the sun to return.

55:56.019 --> 55:57.100
Great.

55:58.856 --> 56:01.188
Come on, let's have something to eat.

56:01.984 --> 56:03.816
I could do us something hot.

56:07.281 --> 56:09.693
Someone just jumped on my foot.

56:11.660 --> 56:14.573
There are so many invisible creatures around.

56:17.583 --> 56:19.790
I had no clue about all this.

56:19.793 --> 56:21.955
Invisible shrews, cut it out.

56:30.929 --> 56:32.090
Tell me, how big

56:32.097 --> 56:33.963
does the bonfire have to be?

56:33.974 --> 56:35.180
Pretty big.

56:36.059 --> 56:37.641
There's not much time.

56:38.228 --> 56:40.060
I wonder if we'll manage.

56:40.063 --> 56:42.680
We'll be ready; don't you worry.

56:42.691 --> 56:44.523
But now, let's have some nice hot soup

56:44.526 --> 56:45.982
and listen to music.

56:46.862 --> 56:49.274
But what about a gift for Christmas?

56:49.281 --> 56:51.568
Maybe I'll draw her something.

56:52.284 --> 56:54.195
I'm quite good at drawing.

56:54.202 --> 56:55.442
Good idea.

57:06.590 --> 57:08.797
Mmm, thanks.

57:08.800 --> 57:13.089
That was delicious,
but maybe I should get going.

57:28.528 --> 57:30.644
Everybody's busy cleaning.

57:30.822 --> 57:32.688
No need for me to be here.

57:32.866 --> 57:35.233
I'd rather go sledding on snow,

57:36.787 --> 57:39.870
especially now that
I have a nice warm snowsuit.

57:43.961 --> 57:46.544
I'll try sliding downhill on this tray.

57:50.550 --> 57:53.542
Yee, out of my way!

57:54.096 --> 57:55.211
Maybe Little My can help

57:55.222 --> 57:58.635
- us with the gifts.
- Woohoo, wooie!

57:59.518 --> 58:04.888
It's Little My; ready or not, here I come.

58:05.315 --> 58:07.181
My, watch out.

58:17.953 --> 58:19.318
Are you two alright?

58:19.705 --> 58:23.198
My, you and your monkey business.

58:23.208 --> 58:24.869
Do you have a gift for Christmas yet?

58:24.876 --> 58:27.413
I think I'll make skis for Christmas.

58:27.963 --> 58:31.081
Then she can slide down a hill the way
I do on the tray.

58:31.174 --> 58:33.666
You're nothin' but a troublemaker.

58:33.760 --> 58:37.298
In fact, if you make skis
as well as you make trouble,

58:37.305 --> 58:38.761
it'll be first-rate.

58:39.307 --> 58:42.140
Now what can I use to make skis?

58:45.313 --> 58:50.308
Look I will make a pair of skis,
but for myself.

58:50.318 --> 58:54.107
My wonderful company will be
enough of a gift for Christmas.

58:55.532 --> 58:56.897
Woohoo!

58:57.909 --> 59:01.948
Woohoo, these skis are perfect.

59:01.955 --> 59:03.116
Whoo!

59:04.541 --> 59:06.828
I'm going to ski down every hill

59:06.835 --> 59:10.499
and I'll be faster than
Hemulen in no time, yippee!

59:10.505 --> 59:13.463
My, you only ever think of yourself.

59:13.467 --> 59:15.424
Come and help us gather wood.

59:15.427 --> 59:17.043
I wish Snufkin were here.

59:17.054 --> 59:18.840
He's already to pitch in.

59:18.847 --> 59:21.339
Alright, I'll help you but my way.

59:21.349 --> 59:23.306
I will tell all of the Woodland creatures

59:23.310 --> 59:24.516
to bring you some wood.

59:24.519 --> 59:26.385
And I'll spend the afternoon skiing.

59:26.396 --> 59:27.431
Whoo!

59:34.613 --> 59:36.274
Too-Ticky, are you sure

59:36.281 --> 59:37.988
this stack is high enough?

59:39.367 --> 59:43.110
Hey, this is the bench from our garden.

59:44.748 --> 59:48.366
Yup, But it was broken
and no One uses it anymore.

59:48.376 --> 59:52.711
Don't be stingy,
we're doing this for the return of the sun.

59:53.465 --> 59:55.172
I guess you're right.

59:55.383 --> 59:57.795
I think I'll go back home
and look for some other things

59:57.803 --> 59:59.168
we can burn.

59:59.721 --> 01:00:01.962
Fine, you go look for more wood.

01:00:13.568 --> 01:00:14.603
Whoo!

01:00:16.363 --> 01:00:17.774
What are you doing, Moominpappa?

01:00:17.781 --> 01:00:20.239
Oh hello, you recognized me.

01:00:20.242 --> 01:00:23.109
Nothing, I'm not doing anything in particular.

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:24.827
Maybe I can help you.

01:00:24.830 --> 01:00:27.162
No no no, there's no need.

01:00:27.541 --> 01:00:29.623
Isn't this Fillyj0nk's forest?

01:00:29.626 --> 01:00:32.038
Could that be one of her trees?

01:00:32.546 --> 01:00:34.583
What are You talking about, My?

01:00:34.589 --> 01:00:35.875
I dare say it's been a while

01:00:35.882 --> 01:00:37.088
since you've been in these parts.

01:00:37.092 --> 01:00:39.709
You don't know your way around here anymore.

01:00:40.053 --> 01:00:41.464
I don't think so.

01:00:41.471 --> 01:00:43.462
I know this forest pretty well.

01:00:43.473 --> 01:00:46.090
Ooh, Well The fact is somebody cut this down

01:00:46.101 --> 01:00:47.717
and I happened to walk by...

01:00:47.727 --> 01:00:50.845
Don't worry,
I won't tell how you stole the tree.

01:00:51.356 --> 01:00:53.063
Woo, woo!

01:00:53.692 --> 01:00:55.729
Our ancestors were right.

01:00:55.735 --> 01:00:58.272
It's wiser to sleep through the whole Winter

01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:01.147
than have to save your family from danger

01:01:01.158 --> 01:01:04.025
and wait for somebody named Christmas to come.

01:01:05.787 --> 01:01:08.950
Do we have A dress for The Christmas tree?

01:01:08.957 --> 01:01:11.369
Oh dear, you're shivering.

01:01:11.376 --> 01:01:12.662
Maybe you would like a blanket

01:01:12.669 --> 01:01:14.706
or something warm to wrap up in?

01:01:14.713 --> 01:01:16.124
Yes, please.

01:01:16.131 --> 01:01:17.713
Here, take this.

01:01:17.716 --> 01:01:20.299
Now I'll get you some hot tea.

01:01:20.552 --> 01:01:22.884
Hmm, perhaps my shawl would look better

01:01:22.888 --> 01:01:25.004
on the Christmas tree than a dress.

01:01:25.015 --> 01:01:27.131
But it might be too small.

01:01:27.142 --> 01:01:28.303
Thanks.

01:01:29.019 --> 01:01:30.635
A Christmas tree should be dressed up

01:01:30.645 --> 01:01:33.637
with beautiful things, not with clothes.

01:01:34.357 --> 01:01:35.722
Oh really?

01:01:35.734 --> 01:01:37.270
Thank you, Woody.

01:01:38.153 --> 01:01:39.268
Happy to help!

01:01:39.279 --> 01:01:41.065
Beautiful things.

01:01:41.072 --> 01:01:43.689
Well I have lots of lovely things.

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:45.941
Maybe my necklaces.

01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:49.578
The Moomin family decorated the Spruce tree

01:01:49.581 --> 01:01:52.949
with seashells from last Summer's flower beds,

01:01:52.959 --> 01:01:57.749
Snorkmaiden's pearl necklaces,
a beautiful bark boat,

01:01:57.756 --> 01:02:00.464
prisms from the drawing room chandelier

01:02:00.467 --> 01:02:03.960
and other items
they found especially fine looking.

01:02:03.970 --> 01:02:06.211
At the very top of the tree,

01:02:06.223 --> 01:02:10.717
Moominmamma's rose brooch took pride of place.

01:02:11.853 --> 01:02:14.094
It looks beautiful.

01:02:14.105 --> 01:02:16.642
Oh I hope we've done everything right.

01:02:19.110 --> 01:02:20.191
Here you go.

01:02:31.539 --> 01:02:33.155
Well, there we go.

01:02:35.377 --> 01:02:38.369
What do you think this Christmas eats?

01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:41.589
I've sat out blueberry pie and juice.

01:02:42.050 --> 01:02:44.257
Oh I hope she's not too hungry.

01:02:56.523 --> 01:02:57.684
Ready.

01:02:58.108 --> 01:03:00.349
Now we wait for nightfall.

01:03:08.994 --> 01:03:10.780
The bonfire must be huge.

01:03:10.787 --> 01:03:12.448
No, hmm.

01:03:12.622 --> 01:03:14.659
These old things are perfect.

01:03:14.666 --> 01:03:18.284
We don't use them anymore
and they're not family heirlooms.

01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:20.286
This, too.

01:03:20.547 --> 01:03:22.538
I think Mamma would agree.

01:03:24.426 --> 01:03:26.133
Oh, hello Mamma.

01:03:26.136 --> 01:03:28.047
What are you doing here, Moomintroll?

01:03:28.054 --> 01:03:30.011
Mamma, I really need to take these

01:03:30.015 --> 01:03:32.757
because I'm building a bonfire with Too-Ticky.

01:03:32.767 --> 01:03:34.553
Why a bonfire?

01:03:35.353 --> 01:03:37.219
We're doing it for the sun.

01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:40.518
Look, there are so many things
we don't use anymore.

01:03:40.525 --> 01:03:43.108
Now they can be made use of for a good cause.

01:03:43.111 --> 01:03:46.649
Yes you're right, we do have a lot of things.

01:03:46.656 --> 01:03:49.899
It's very nice of you
and Too-Ticky to think about the sun.

01:03:49.909 --> 01:03:51.616
Are you lo0kin' for something, Mamma?

01:03:51.619 --> 01:03:55.032
I was looking for You
and heard noise from up here.

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:57.247
I reckoned you were up to something.

01:03:57.250 --> 01:03:59.787
Hope the bonfire makes the sun return.

01:03:59.794 --> 01:04:02.627
Just remember to be back
in time for the evening.

01:04:06.634 --> 01:04:09.672
Oh, a torchlight procession.

01:04:10.055 --> 01:04:11.762
They know about the bonfire

01:04:11.765 --> 01:04:14.257
and are bringing wood to add to the pile.

01:04:15.143 --> 01:04:17.259
I must remember to show Too-Ticky the picture

01:04:17.270 --> 01:04:19.762
I painted as a present for Christmas.

01:04:19.773 --> 01:04:21.013
Don't be late.

01:04:22.734 --> 01:04:25.021
Too-Ticky will be happy
that we have so many things

01:04:25.028 --> 01:04:27.110
to put on the bonfire.

01:04:29.949 --> 01:04:31.064
Ooh!

01:04:33.161 --> 01:04:36.028
Wow, the moonlight is...

01:04:36.039 --> 01:04:38.747
It's almost like the sun is gazing at the moon

01:04:38.750 --> 01:04:40.332
like in a mirror.

01:04:41.002 --> 01:04:44.961
Ha, goodie, more stuff.

01:04:45.632 --> 01:04:49.000
This is goin' to be the greatest bonfire ever!

01:04:49.386 --> 01:04:50.876
Fantabulous!

01:04:50.887 --> 01:04:51.843
Come on.

01:05:01.064 --> 01:05:04.147
Sorry-0o's heart is filled with longing.

01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:05.766
He climbs up into the mountains

01:05:05.777 --> 01:05:08.986
to answer the call of his wolf brothers.

01:05:08.988 --> 01:05:13.528
He is cold and not a little sorry
he left Hemulen behind.

01:05:13.535 --> 01:05:15.572
What if they don't like me?

01:05:19.165 --> 01:05:23.204
I've come this far, I ought to at least try.

01:05:25.338 --> 01:05:26.669
Is it them?

01:05:27.048 --> 01:05:29.130
Yes, at last!

01:05:31.261 --> 01:05:33.548
Hi, greetings.

01:05:33.555 --> 01:05:35.466
I am your brother.

01:05:37.058 --> 01:05:38.298
We don't know each other yet,

01:05:38.309 --> 01:05:41.142
but perhaps you'd like to come

01:05:42.730 --> 01:05:47.600
and celebrate Christmas
with me and the Moomins.

01:05:47.610 --> 01:05:50.648
Sorry-00 realizes his mistake.

01:05:50.864 --> 01:05:52.650
The wolves aren't his brothers.

01:05:52.657 --> 01:05:55.024
Instead, he might get eaten

01:05:55.034 --> 01:05:58.493
and possibly have time to consider
what a fool he has been.

01:05:58.496 --> 01:05:59.611
Brothers?

01:06:00.123 --> 01:06:03.081
The wolves slowly close in on Sorry-00.

01:06:03.084 --> 01:06:05.075
Help, help, help!

01:06:05.086 --> 01:06:10.081
Somebody, anybody, please, help!

01:06:10.467 --> 01:06:12.174
Help!

01:06:12.635 --> 01:06:14.217
Sorry-go!

01:06:15.138 --> 01:06:17.550
Help, help!

01:06:18.016 --> 01:06:19.177
That's him!

01:06:19.184 --> 01:06:20.845
He's calling for help, for me!

01:06:20.852 --> 01:06:23.844
Help!

01:06:24.063 --> 01:06:26.930
Sorry-00 have no fear, I'm coming.

01:06:26.941 --> 01:06:28.181
I will find you!

01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:30.021
Please!

01:06:35.325 --> 01:06:37.362
Wolves, out of my way.

01:06:37.702 --> 01:06:39.909
Get, shoo, scat!

01:06:40.038 --> 01:06:41.028
Get lost!

01:06:43.791 --> 01:06:45.782
- Be off with you!
- Hemulen.

01:06:48.421 --> 01:06:50.913
Scram, get, skedaddle!

01:06:57.180 --> 01:06:59.672
Hemulen, thank you Hemulen.

01:07:00.892 --> 01:07:02.599
You saved me!

01:07:02.602 --> 01:07:03.888
No trouble.

01:07:03.895 --> 01:07:05.306
<i>Oh, Sorry-co.</i>

01:07:05.313 --> 01:07:07.771
Have you been waiting for me to rescue you?

01:07:07.774 --> 01:07:10.186
Oh don't be afraid now, they're gone.

01:07:10.193 --> 01:07:12.184
I told you nothing good would come out

01:07:12.195 --> 01:07:14.152
of this wolves business.

01:07:14.155 --> 01:07:17.864
Sometimes family can be complicated.

01:07:18.326 --> 01:07:20.408
Sorry-00 is no longer afraid

01:07:20.411 --> 01:07:23.119
with Hemulen skiing by his side.

01:07:23.122 --> 01:07:25.830
And Hemulen is happy because at last

01:07:25.833 --> 01:07:28.040
he has a dog who likes him.

01:07:28.044 --> 01:07:31.582
Sorry-00 gives up dreaming
of his wolf brothers.

01:07:31.589 --> 01:07:34.581
He has found something more important:

01:07:34.592 --> 01:07:36.458
a true-hearted friend.

01:07:37.428 --> 01:07:40.386
I'm not the only one
who wants the sun to come back.

01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:41.505
I hope this helps.

01:07:41.516 --> 01:07:45.510
Aah, say goodbye to this broken chair.

01:07:45.812 --> 01:07:47.098
Bye bye, chair.

01:07:47.355 --> 01:07:49.346
There you go, be off!

01:07:51.901 --> 01:07:53.938
The usually shy, timid Woody

01:07:53.945 --> 01:07:56.437
begins drumming ecstatically.

01:07:56.489 --> 01:08:00.073
Giant shadows seem to dance on the mountain.

01:08:00.076 --> 01:08:03.489
Valley dwellers give themselves
up to merry-making

01:08:03.496 --> 01:08:05.828
and play unheard of giggling.

01:08:11.796 --> 01:08:14.254
Are you sure the sun will return, Too-Ticky?

01:08:14.257 --> 01:08:17.500
Listen Moomintroll, this always works.

01:08:18.011 --> 01:08:19.421
Do you think the sun would notice

01:08:19.429 --> 01:08:21.841
if the garden bench was on the fire or not?

01:08:21.848 --> 01:08:23.680
Do you think the sun cares?

01:08:23.683 --> 01:08:27.846
This bonfire is 1,000 years
older than your garden bench.

01:08:27.854 --> 01:08:29.640
You should be honored that it is worthy

01:08:29.647 --> 01:08:31.729
of being burned on this bonfire.

01:08:31.733 --> 01:08:32.814
Hmm.

01:08:36.487 --> 01:08:39.149
The Woodland creatures are shying away.

01:08:39.157 --> 01:08:39.817
Why?

01:08:39.823 --> 01:08:41.314
They don't know you.

01:08:41.326 --> 01:08:43.283
You usually sleep all Winter.

01:08:46.497 --> 01:08:49.033
Maybe they want
to keep their secrets to themselves.

01:08:49.751 --> 01:08:51.116
I understand.

01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:53.535
The Groke is coming.

01:08:57.050 --> 01:08:59.256
Now this is something.

01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:01.591
Too-Ticky, do you think the Groke

01:09:01.595 --> 01:09:03.587
will come all the way to here?

01:09:04.474 --> 01:09:07.091
I could fight from stomping out The fire.

01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:11.937
I don't like it, but today I'm not in the mood.

01:09:11.939 --> 01:09:14.680
She has grown a lot bigger since August.

01:09:32.001 --> 01:09:33.537
It's so cold.

01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:36.752
Look, she's coming closer.

01:09:36.923 --> 01:09:39.210
What do you think she wants?

01:09:41.844 --> 01:09:44.051
We're safe here in the cave.

01:09:44.055 --> 01:09:45.886
The Groke wants the fire.

01:09:45.890 --> 01:09:47.220
She's always freezing cold.

01:09:47.225 --> 01:09:48.886
She wants to warm herself.

01:09:51.062 --> 01:09:53.520
I think the Groke likes it.

01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:55.146
I wonder why.

01:09:55.483 --> 01:09:56.973
Looks like it.

01:09:56.984 --> 01:09:59.066
I think she longs for the unattainable

01:09:59.070 --> 01:10:00.902
as so many of us do.

01:10:00.905 --> 01:10:03.488
I wonder if she feels better right now.

01:10:03.825 --> 01:10:06.692
Maybe she won't be so cold anymore

01:10:06.703 --> 01:10:09.070
and the sun will finally come back.

01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:10.241
I hope so.

01:10:20.299 --> 01:10:23.712
Poor Groke, she just wanted to get warm.

01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:26.678
But now the fire's out, she's miserable again.

01:10:28.182 --> 01:10:30.219
I should be getting home.

01:10:30.226 --> 01:10:32.012
Christmas will come soon.

01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:54.164
Finally, where have you been all this time?

01:10:54.167 --> 01:10:56.204
We were getting really worried.

01:10:56.210 --> 01:10:58.577
Where are your brothers, the wolves?

01:10:58.588 --> 01:11:02.627
Sometimes it's better to keep family
at a safe distance.

01:11:02.633 --> 01:11:03.589
May we come in?

01:11:03.593 --> 01:11:05.334
I hope there are some pancakes left.

01:11:05.344 --> 01:11:07.130
He deserves them, Moomintroll.

01:11:07.138 --> 01:11:09.004
He was a real hero today.

01:11:09.015 --> 01:11:11.848
I'm sure we can rustle up
some pancakes for you.

01:11:11.851 --> 01:11:13.091
Come in.

01:11:32.163 --> 01:11:34.370
So when is Christmas coming?

01:11:34.624 --> 01:11:36.331
Everything is ready.

01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:38.495
She seems to be late.

01:11:46.302 --> 01:11:50.921
Oh, Merry Christmas Moominfamily from us all.

01:11:51.224 --> 01:11:52.305
Thank you.

01:11:53.142 --> 01:11:55.383
You've got such a pretty Spruce tree.

01:11:55.394 --> 01:11:57.886
May we stay and admire it for a while?

01:11:58.147 --> 01:12:00.104
So much food!

01:12:00.691 --> 01:12:02.648
Make yourselves at home.

01:12:10.368 --> 01:12:11.858
Hope you like it.

01:12:11.869 --> 01:12:13.530
There's lots more to eat.

01:12:22.922 --> 01:12:25.414
Don't forget to leave something
for Christmas too

01:12:25.424 --> 01:12:27.165
when she shows up.

01:12:47.029 --> 01:12:50.522
I never thought winter could be so much fun.

01:12:55.496 --> 01:12:58.158
Everything went just as planned.

01:12:58.165 --> 01:13:02.409
But I'm so tired,
I can barely keep my eyes open.

01:13:04.505 --> 01:13:06.496
The visit of unexpected guests

01:13:06.507 --> 01:13:09.374
turned out to be quite enjoyable.

01:13:09.385 --> 01:13:13.424
Moominmamma and Moominpappa go to sleep happy,

01:13:13.431 --> 01:13:18.141
but also very, very tired
after the Christmas celebration.

01:13:18.144 --> 01:13:20.431
I wonder what Christmas thinks now.

01:13:20.438 --> 01:13:24.523
Gracious, I'm too sleepy
to ponder the meaning of it all.

01:13:24.567 --> 01:13:27.901
But maybe this is what Christmas is all about,

01:13:27.904 --> 01:13:29.486
making others happy.

01:13:29.488 --> 01:13:31.604
Well, you're probably right.

01:13:31.616 --> 01:13:34.950
I must add a chapter on this to my memoirs.

01:13:36.621 --> 01:13:39.909
Even though Mo0mintr0ll's own belly is full,

01:13:39.916 --> 01:13:43.159
he doesn't forget to feed the ancestor

01:13:44.670 --> 01:13:48.584
and the dweller under the sink
before going back to sleep.

01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:54.468
There you are, it's raspberry.

01:14:04.815 --> 01:14:06.431
Moomintroll falls asleep

01:14:06.442 --> 01:14:08.934
the moment his head hits the pillow.

01:14:08.945 --> 01:14:11.903
He hopes that
the Lady of the Cold and Christmas

01:14:11.906 --> 01:14:13.817
are happy with their presents

01:14:13.824 --> 01:14:16.942
and will let the sun come back soon.

01:14:16.953 --> 01:14:19.536
And he thinks about the Groke,

01:14:19.538 --> 01:14:23.281
and her lonely, passionate longing for warmth.

01:14:24.543 --> 01:14:26.955
The Northern Lights bedazzle the sky

01:14:26.963 --> 01:14:29.830
with thousands of colors as if the sun,

01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:33.959
eager to return, is blowing on them
with its warm breath

01:14:33.970 --> 01:14:36.553
to make them swoop and sway.

01:14:36.555 --> 01:14:38.842
The Moomins know nothing
about what is happening

01:14:38.849 --> 01:14:40.931
in the sky above them.

01:14:40.935 --> 01:14:44.644
The Lady of the Cold
knows it is time for her to leave

01:14:44.647 --> 01:14:48.106
and vanishes softly into the horizon.

01:14:53.948 --> 01:14:57.157
Moomintroll dreams that
the sun is making its way

01:14:57.159 --> 01:15:00.777
from the far reaches of the universe
to the Moominvalley

01:15:00.788 --> 01:15:04.247
bringing all the warmth and joy of Summer.

01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:09.120
And everything Moomintroll knows
and loves will come back.

01:15:12.550 --> 01:15:13.836
The sun!

01:15:14.093 --> 01:15:15.379
It's back!

01:15:16.012 --> 01:15:18.800
Ooh, it's so warm.

01:15:18.806 --> 01:15:21.218
I need to honor the sun somehow.

01:15:23.019 --> 01:15:25.260
I want to go thank Too-Ticky.

01:15:29.650 --> 01:15:31.891
These are perfect to welcome the sun.

01:15:31.902 --> 01:15:33.358
Golden ribbons.

01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:40.991
It's back!

01:15:42.371 --> 01:15:43.736
The sun.

01:15:44.290 --> 01:15:47.203
I know, it came back as it does every year.

01:15:47.209 --> 01:15:49.246
Wasn't that because of what we did?

01:15:49.754 --> 01:15:52.746
Well that's something no one can be sure of.

01:15:52.757 --> 01:15:56.671
Tell me Too-Ticky,
did you know that she wouldn't come?

01:15:56.677 --> 01:15:59.339
- Who?
- Christmas.

01:15:59.972 --> 01:16:01.588
Oh but she did come.

01:16:01.599 --> 01:16:04.387
Just not in the way you expected her.

01:16:05.061 --> 01:16:06.768
Why didn't you tell me?

01:16:07.354 --> 01:16:08.515
I wanted you to discover

01:16:08.522 --> 01:16:10.889
the magic of Christmas for yourself.

01:16:11.233 --> 01:16:13.065
You know you've had a wonderful Christmas

01:16:13.069 --> 01:16:14.980
when you spend the longest nights of the year

01:16:14.987 --> 01:16:16.694
together with the people you love:

01:16:16.697 --> 01:16:18.654
Your family and friends.

01:16:19.158 --> 01:16:20.944
I am so tired.

01:16:21.577 --> 01:16:24.069
This Christmas has wiped me out.

01:16:30.753 --> 01:16:33.666
It was fun having all those guests
and making new friends.

01:16:33.672 --> 01:16:37.040
But I can't stop thinking
how wonderful I will be

01:16:37.051 --> 01:16:39.634
to fall asleep in my own bed.

01:16:39.887 --> 01:16:42.345
I'm sure it will be, Moomintroll.

01:16:53.776 --> 01:16:56.689
The more Moomintroll thinks about the sun,

01:16:56.695 --> 01:16:59.983
the more he longs for the happy days of Summer.

01:17:00.074 --> 01:17:04.159
Ohh, I miss the sun so much.

01:17:24.890 --> 01:17:28.178
So Winter can be nice
if you have a chance to experience it.

01:17:28.185 --> 01:17:30.677
The world can be mysterious and magical

01:17:30.688 --> 01:17:32.429
even when you stay close to home.

01:17:32.439 --> 01:17:35.557
When I wake up again,
I'll tell Snufkin all about it.

01:17:35.568 --> 01:17:37.229
Yes, darling.

01:17:44.535 --> 01:17:46.867
Moomintroll slowly nods off,

01:17:46.871 --> 01:17:49.363
but he can't leave Winter behind.

01:17:49.790 --> 01:17:52.452
He shudders thinking about the Lady of the Cold

01:17:52.459 --> 01:17:54.166
and the memory of the fire

01:17:54.170 --> 01:17:57.003
makes him snuggle deeper under the coverlet.

01:17:57.631 --> 01:18:00.965
He muses about how Winter is different.

01:18:01.177 --> 01:18:04.966
It is deep and dark and mysterious.

01:18:05.264 --> 01:18:07.221
One can lose one's way in it,

01:18:07.224 --> 01:18:10.888
and still strangely feel at home.

01:18:11.937 --> 01:18:16.932
Above all, he thinks about
the peculiar invisible creatures

01:18:17.109 --> 01:18:20.272
whom he would never have
met if not for Christmas.

01:18:39.715 --> 01:18:42.878
A Winter storm rolls near.

01:18:42.885 --> 01:18:47.220
The sky darkens, the worried gusts of wind

01:18:47.223 --> 01:18:50.215
rush to and fro over the snowdrifts.

01:18:50.684 --> 01:18:53.051
If Moomintroll were outside,

01:18:53.062 --> 01:18:56.726
he might feel something familiar in the air.

01:18:56.732 --> 01:18:59.474
A hint of a promise of things to come

01:18:59.485 --> 01:19:04.730
that make him feel light
and almost like flying.
