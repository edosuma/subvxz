[Nicole] Previously
on What About Brian:

00:02.166 --> 00:03.834
- Are you Jamie?
- Yeah.

00:03.834 --> 00:06.125
Maybe your manny boyfriend
can come over

00:06.125 --> 00:08.625
- and watch the kids.
- He's not my boyfriend.

00:08.625 --> 00:11.542
- You'll stay here.
- You want me to move back in?

00:11.542 --> 00:13.959
I'm not saying we should
get back together.

00:13.959 --> 00:16.583
I'm just saying
this is your home.

00:16.583 --> 00:21.166
Women have caused me nothing
but problems. I am taking
a vow of celibacy.

00:21.166 --> 00:24.166
- A vow of what?
- No sex until I make partner.

00:30.917 --> 00:34.792

I wanted to hear Bella...

Oh, of course.
She's just sleeping like...

- Morning.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.875
- [Nicole] This is a nightmare.
- Sounds like
a sweet dream to me.

01:51.875 --> 01:54.750
So how was it?
You know, the sex?

01:54.750 --> 01:58.625
Would you stop?
This is so stupid. I mean,
he's probably gay anyway.

01:58.625 --> 02:02.792
And if he's gay
then maybe I can stop dreaming
about jumping his bones.

02:02.792 --> 02:06.583
So find out. Ask him
if he prefers Saturdays
or Sundays off.

02:06.583 --> 02:08.792
What, to prove
that he goes to church?

guy wants to work on a Sunday?

- Gay guys like football.
- Name one.

That's not the point.
Point is that I'm having
sex dreams about my nanny.

02:18.959 --> 02:22.750
It's one thing to dream about a
guy that you see in a car wash.

naked bodies and...

- Hi.
- Hey, Dave.

02:30.166 --> 02:33.375
Don't stop on account of me.
You were up to "naked bodies."

02:33.375 --> 02:36.917
- I keep forgetting
that you're back.
- I'm not... We're not...

02:36.917 --> 02:40.875
- Right. No, he's here...

- Right.

02:40.875 --> 02:43.959
So is it fun?
Living together again?

02:45.041 --> 02:46.625
- Sure.
- Sure.

We've been living together

Well, I guess they lost.

You sure it's not too short?
It feels too short.

03:11.792 --> 03:15.458
Yes, I told you. It looks great.
It's just a haircut, relax.

03:15.458 --> 03:17.542
- When are you getting back?
- Saturday.

03:17.542 --> 03:19.959
I thought Friday.
We were gonna do stuff.

I don't talk to them,
I barely know their names.

03:30.792 --> 03:32.667
They don't remember
what I look like.

Wow, when did you
get that haircut?

04:01.542 --> 04:03.375
The leak in the wall
you fixed?

04:03.375 --> 04:06.041
You didn't fix it.
It's sort of spraying.

04:06.041 --> 04:08.834
- Into the living room.
- When you say spraying...

with duct tape.

managed to turn off the water.

How about calling a
professional?

That guy who gave you that cute
haircut could do a better job.

- It's cute?
Don't think it's too short?
- It's fine.

04:41.333 --> 04:44.583
We'll move the party. Maybe
there's a bar we can take over?

04:44.583 --> 04:47.834
We can't move the party.
The invites are out
with our address.

- Wait, I got it.
- She's got it.

04:50.458 --> 04:53.959
- We'll have the party here.
- You'll have it what?

04:53.959 --> 04:57.333
We put the bar here
and leave a sign on the door:
"Party upstairs."

with my friends Dave and Adam.

11:59.709 --> 12:02.375
But, Dave and I used
to work together at Zap Monkey.

12:02.375 --> 12:05.959
Zap what?
Actually, I don't really care.

12:05.959 --> 12:08.166
And you? Do you work here?

12:08.166 --> 12:11.375
No, no. I'm just a lawyer
who came for some lunch.

12:11.375 --> 12:15.250
So if you're not my employee,
I can ask you if you're single
and not get sued?

12:16.834 --> 12:22.542
Right. Yeah. I, uh, I am single.
But I've taken a vow
of celibacy.

12:23.917 --> 12:27.041
I am not going to even bother
to ask you about that.

12:27.041 --> 12:30.041
Yeah, I wouldn't. It's a good
idea to stay away from that.

12:30.041 --> 12:34.083
- Well, Dave,
30 words or less, right?
- Yeah.

12:35.959 --> 12:39.083
- Good luck.
- All right.

12:56.792 --> 12:58.250
What are you doing?

12:58.250 --> 13:02.917
Oh, me? Just... trying to hook
the fax line to this phone.

13:02.917 --> 13:05.667
Figured we don't use it and
so I would have my own line.

13:05.667 --> 13:08.083
- That's a good idea.
- Yeah.

13:08.083 --> 13:13.000
You know, I got work calls
and you got the whole cupcake
stuff, you know? So...

13:13.000 --> 13:16.250
- ...if we have our own lines...
- That's a good point.

13:16.250 --> 13:18.750
So the girls asleep?

13:18.750 --> 13:21.917
Don't know if they're asleep,
but they're definitely in bed.

13:21.917 --> 13:24.667
It's nice to have you here,
you know?

13:24.667 --> 13:28.375
I know. It's nice to be back.

13:32.291 --> 13:36.959
I... I got a... stack of work
I should probably get done.

13:38.750 --> 13:42.667
Oh, I'm just going to go
take a bath and, uh,
hit the hay.

13:42.667 --> 13:43.750
OK.

having a party. I'm just
finishing up my repairs.

No, I'm not staying.
I'm leaving right now.
OK. Night.

14:55.125 --> 14:57.458
Yeah, you missed.

14:58.333 --> 15:00.542
- Brian.
- Hey.

15:00.542 --> 15:02.709
I thought you said
you weren't going to look hot.

15:02.709 --> 15:04.542
Oh, this old thing?

15:13.875 --> 15:17.917
I have a girlfriend.
I love my girlfriend.

15:21.417 --> 15:25.875
I say, ever since this vow of
celibacy, things have really
been clicking for me.

15:25.875 --> 15:29.041
- You should try it.
- No, thanks. I like the sex.

15:29.041 --> 15:30.125
Thank you.

15:30.125 --> 15:32.542
- Hi.
- Can I buy you a drink?

15:32.542 --> 15:36.250
Yeah. Sure. But you have
to know I'm not really dating.

15:36.250 --> 15:39.250
Well, who said anything
about dating?

15:39.250 --> 15:42.875
He doesn't do that either.
He's celibate as a monk.

15:42.875 --> 15:46.125
Oh, really?
Wow, what a waste.

15:46.125 --> 15:48.083
- Hmm.
- Oh, well.

15:48.083 --> 15:49.375
Jimmy?

15:53.375 --> 15:56.417
Yeah. Um, do...
Do I... Do I know you?

15:56.417 --> 15:57.834
Joanna. Remember?

15:59.208 --> 16:01.625
Sorry. I... I don't...
I don't really...

16:01.625 --> 16:05.458
Oh, come on.
We met about a year ago
at a boring law party.

16:05.458 --> 16:07.625
- We did?
- You did?

16:07.625 --> 16:10.375
- We didn't.
- At the Bel-Air Hotel.

16:10.375 --> 16:11.792
I remember that party.

16:11.792 --> 16:16.917
Yeah. And then we... you know,
had room service for breakfast.

16:16.917 --> 16:20.291
- Ooh.
- Jimmy, what's going on?

16:20.291 --> 16:22.333
OK. First...

16:22.333 --> 16:26.083
...I have never seen this woman
before in my life, all right?

16:26.083 --> 16:28.458
I swear. And I don't know
what the hell you...

16:28.458 --> 16:30.917
You got to believe me, baby.
She obviously...

16:30.917 --> 16:33.583
You have me confused
with some other brother...

16:33.583 --> 16:37.000
Jimmy. I'm sorry,
but, uh... gotcha.

[Adam laughing]

- Yeah.

- No, no.

16:46.792 --> 16:49.375
- Bye, Jimmy.

- Hi.

17:04.125 --> 17:05.834
Hi. Did you work
on the movie?

17:05.834 --> 17:08.166
Oh, yeah, the movie.
Yeah, I was, uh...

17:08.166 --> 17:10.583
I did the snacks.
There was...
I was a snack guy.

17:10.583 --> 17:11.959
- Hey, high-five!
- Yeah!

- Dave, close the door!

is going on here?
- Huh?

Take off the headphones!
You throwing some party
and you don't invite me?

17:29.667 --> 17:32.875
No, not me. I am not having a
party. I'm not at this party.

17:32.875 --> 17:36.208
You're my witness. What are you
doing? Thought you were working.

17:36.208 --> 17:39.333
Yeah, I was working at home,
but then I had a block.

17:39.333 --> 17:41.750
So I figured I'd come over here
and you could...

17:41.750 --> 17:43.542
Sure, yeah. I can help.

17:43.542 --> 17:45.917
- I got distracted.
- Distracted?

17:45.917 --> 17:47.166
I saw Deena naked.

17:47.166 --> 17:49.542
- Wow.
- Yeah.

17:49.542 --> 17:53.083
Was he looking at you
or parts of you?

17:53.083 --> 17:57.041
Well, it wasn't what
he was looking at, it was...

17:57.041 --> 17:59.875
...how it felt to see him
looking at me, you know.

17:59.875 --> 18:02.083
How it felt to be looked at

18:02.083 --> 18:05.750
and, I think, desired by him.

18:06.709 --> 18:08.625
Yeah.

18:08.625 --> 18:12.166
It's funny, you know, because,

18:12.166 --> 18:15.417
I remember the
first time we did it.

18:15.417 --> 18:17.250
You know, got naked together.

18:17.250 --> 18:20.250
That's so burned in my mind.

18:20.250 --> 18:23.625
We were in his dorm room,
in college,

18:23.625 --> 18:28.667
and I just took my clothes off
in front of him.

18:28.667 --> 18:32.792
This... This felt
exactly like that.

18:32.792 --> 18:35.875
Well, what did he say,
after?

18:35.875 --> 18:40.250
Well, he didn't say anything.
He just ran off to Brian's.

18:40.250 --> 18:43.041
I don't know. He probably
isn't thinking about it.

18:43.041 --> 18:44.417
What the hell am I doing?

18:44.417 --> 18:47.625
This is the most important
assignment I've ever been handed

18:47.625 --> 18:49.583
and I can't stop focusing

18:49.583 --> 18:53.458
about my naked wife.
And you are enabling me.

18:53.458 --> 18:55.291
- What? I am?
- Yeah.

18:55.291 --> 18:58.625
You are. Enough! Enough
with the whole Deena thing, Bri.

world want in a video game?

- What are you guys
doing in here?
- Join the party.

work due tomorrow.

- Yeah.
- What do you do?

19:13.625 --> 19:16.667
Video games. We used
to have a company together.

- Yeah.
- Wow.

19:18.333 --> 19:20.333
I knew you weren't
always a super.

Yeah. I was just giving it
a little time before
I broke the all-important news.

- All right. I should get going.
- You sure?
We're just getting started.

to tell you the character

20:49.333 --> 20:51.917
Sorry, I saw your screen saver
on your screen

20:51.917 --> 20:54.375
and I was interested
in your game.

20:55.041 --> 20:56.208
You're a gamer?

20:56.208 --> 20:58.083
I don't really
know anything about it,

20:58.083 --> 21:00.959
but this one seems
kind of interesting.

21:04.208 --> 21:06.125
Really. Why is that?

21:06.125 --> 21:09.709
Because it's a
real person and not a troll
or a stupid creature.

how to survive in a world
he can't understand.

Well, me and Dave.

You know, he's the computer
head. I just have the stories.

21:23.458 --> 21:26.709
So, why are you
the landlord?

21:26.709 --> 21:28.834
You mean,
only the landlord?

21:30.625 --> 21:34.458
Well, it beats being a garbage
man, right? That's temporary.

21:34.458 --> 21:37.166
You're the psych expert,
but if I had to guess,

21:37.166 --> 21:40.417
I could probably come up
with two options.

21:40.417 --> 21:44.333
One, it seems like
something that would
really piss off my dad.

21:44.333 --> 21:47.417
Or two, I'm just stalling
until I figure out

21:47.417 --> 21:50.125
what I really want to do.
Or probably both.

21:52.583 --> 21:56.458
Wow, I never actually
said that out loud before.

22:01.458 --> 22:03.291
I am exhausted.

22:04.834 --> 22:07.417
Thanks for letting us
have the party, Bri.

22:07.417 --> 22:10.000
- Yeah.
- We'll finish
the clean up tomorrow.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.333
Yes, you will.

22:12.333 --> 22:16.208
Do you mind if I sleep
on your sofa? Couple of friends
are crashed on my bed.

22:16.208 --> 22:18.208
Sure.

22:18.208 --> 22:21.333
Go downstairs and get
some sleep, Laur. I'll do this.

22:58.959 --> 23:01.709
I thought you had
your monitor off.

23:01.709 --> 23:05.834
Oh, I guess I didn't
hear it right away.

23:05.834 --> 23:07.709
I think she's
still half asleep.

23:09.166 --> 23:12.041
OK. well,
see you in the morning.

23:12.041 --> 23:15.000
Yeah, see you then.

Are you really comfortable
with this?

23:20.709 --> 23:22.041
No, I'm
a little cold.

23:22.041 --> 23:25.083
I can see that.
Well, that's not what I meant.

23:25.083 --> 23:26.625
Um...

23:29.542 --> 23:34.041
- I'm a woman. You're a man.
- OK.

23:34.041 --> 23:37.375
You can't deny that there was
tension earlier between us.

23:37.375 --> 23:41.333
And the good kind of tension.

23:41.333 --> 23:45.458
But not so good when
it's between me and my manny.

I'm going to have to let you go.

Wow.

24:03.417 --> 24:07.208
Right, this was Death Mall.
I'm not sure I get it.

24:07.208 --> 24:09.417
Idea is you have
to get your shopping...

24:09.417 --> 24:11.542
While avoiding zombies. Right.

24:11.542 --> 24:15.709
Like commentary on pushy
salespeople. It's cute,
but not the one.

24:15.709 --> 24:16.917
Next.

24:19.667 --> 24:24.458
I, uh, remember this one.

Have a high tech,
complicated vehicle. Cool.

24:27.166 --> 24:30.458
I actually had a hard time
boiling it down to 30 words.

24:30.458 --> 24:31.458
Apparently.

24:32.917 --> 24:36.458
- I mean, the gist of it...
- It's not an oral presentation.

24:36.458 --> 24:40.417
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Not right. Next.

24:41.959 --> 24:43.709
Ping pong.
That's original.

25:00.125 --> 25:04.709
You know, there's this
common perception that
all gamers have to be fat.

25:04.709 --> 25:10.500
Why would you say that?
Wasn't this place
a conference room two days ago?

25:10.500 --> 25:14.500
Oh, yeah.
We got enough of those.

25:14.500 --> 25:19.333
You know, I have to say
it's the first thing I noticed
about KC Gaming. No gym.

25:19.333 --> 25:23.041
They think all us gamers
are couch potatoes.

25:23.041 --> 25:26.041
That was one thing I wasn't.

25:26.041 --> 25:29.083
No, I was kind of a sad,
nervous girl

for a kind of drug.

Fatty Natty could never
get a boyfriend
or get her heart broken.

25:35.333 --> 25:38.375
Fatty Natty could never get a
boyfriend in the first place.

25:40.500 --> 25:42.750
I never called you Fatty Natty.

25:46.792 --> 25:48.583
OK, maybe once.

25:50.250 --> 25:53.041
Is that, uh... is that
why you rejected my idea?

25:53.041 --> 25:56.542
I mean, is there even any point
in me trying with you?

25:56.542 --> 25:58.917
I rejected it 'cause
I didn't see a great game.

25:58.917 --> 26:01.500
How can you know that?
You only read 30 words?

26:01.500 --> 26:06.208
Why would I want to see more
when the first 30 words
weren't interesting.

26:06.208 --> 26:08.000
Huh, Dave?

26:08.000 --> 26:11.500
Because, Natasha,
that's the best stuff.

26:11.500 --> 26:14.333
The stuff that you find
when you're making the thing.

26:14.333 --> 26:17.583
When you're developing it.
Stuff you had no idea
about going in.

26:17.583 --> 26:21.166
You think Michelangelo would've
been commissioned for the David

26:21.166 --> 26:25.250
with a "naked dude, slight turn
to the left, made of marble"?

26:25.250 --> 26:29.333
Look, Dave, you had
some great things
in your pitch.

26:29.333 --> 26:34.250
You did. But that's it.
Things. Not a concept.

26:34.250 --> 26:36.291
The truth is I just...

26:36.291 --> 26:38.875
I don't think you have it
in you to make a great game.

26:38.875 --> 26:42.083
Wow. I'm sorry, but, uh...

26:42.083 --> 26:44.834
I developed Throttle Autobahn.

26:44.834 --> 26:47.125
By myself. You were there.
You saw it.

26:47.125 --> 26:50.375
Yeah. I also saw
you got a lot of help, too.

26:52.083 --> 26:54.917
Look, so what if you had
one great game?

26:54.917 --> 26:56.792
That's more than most people.

26:56.792 --> 27:01.458
Made anything yourself since
Throttle? Anything that's
seen the light of day?

27:01.458 --> 27:05.083
What's your problem?
So what? Who cares?
I called you Fatty Natty.

27:05.083 --> 27:06.583
I mean, you got
to get over it.

27:06.583 --> 27:09.792
I am over it. I think
you're the one who's not.

27:09.792 --> 27:12.375
Look, I get it, OK?
I do.

27:12.375 --> 27:15.625
Now you're working
for the former fat girl
who was your intern.

27:15.625 --> 27:18.792
That can't be easy on the ego.
I understand.

27:18.792 --> 27:21.834
But I have worked my ass off
to get where I am today.

27:21.834 --> 27:25.291
And I'm sorry if I passed you
on the way up. I really am.

27:25.291 --> 27:28.250
Yeah.

27:28.250 --> 27:29.959
[soft rock plays]

27:29.959 --> 27:33.667
Look at him. So cute.

27:35.291 --> 27:38.000
Go for it. Make a move.
Life's too short.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.125
Can't sit around and wait
for things to happen.

27:40.125 --> 27:42.625
Wow. That was
a lot of clichés.

27:42.625 --> 27:47.166
- You didn't make a move
on the manny.
- I sort of did. I fired him.

27:47.166 --> 27:49.208
- You did what?
- What did he do?

27:49.208 --> 27:52.083
You put him in your dream.
He didn't just jump in there.

27:52.083 --> 27:55.166
- I mean, it wasn't his fault.
- I never said it was his fault.

27:55.166 --> 27:58.333
- Do you miss him?
- I think I am
going to miss him.

27:58.333 --> 28:02.667
Mm-hm.
Are you, uh, interviewing?

28:02.667 --> 28:07.333
Well, I talked to the agency.
They said they'd send people
over but I'm just not ready.

28:07.333 --> 28:11.792
Well, I guess it's just his
fault for being so sexy.

28:11.792 --> 28:15.000
I don't need "sexy" in my house
watching my baby.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.417
I do.

28:19.041 --> 28:20.667
Well, go for it.

28:20.667 --> 28:23.291
[Brian] So how'd
it go with Natasha?

28:23.291 --> 28:25.834
- Ah, fine.
- Fine? What happened?

28:25.834 --> 28:28.875
Nothing happened.
Except realizing that creating

28:28.875 --> 28:31.083
the next video game
might not be in my future.

28:31.083 --> 28:34.333
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing. Just shoot.

28:34.333 --> 28:37.750
Dave, you can't
let her get to you.

28:37.750 --> 28:41.208
That game we talked
about's great.
Who cares what she thinks?

28:41.208 --> 28:43.709
I don't care. I just...
I can't fight her, man.

28:43.709 --> 28:46.375
I just need to keep this job.
I need the money.

28:46.375 --> 28:49.458
I need the insurance
with Carrie and everything.

28:49.458 --> 28:52.375
Maybe she's right, man.
Maybe I had my time in the sun.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.458
Seriously, I'm fine.
Just shoot the ball.

28:56.458 --> 28:59.375
No, I'm not gonna go until
you stop talking this crap.

28:59.375 --> 29:02.458
Well, it's the way I'm feeling,
Bri. I'm sorry. All right?

29:03.458 --> 29:04.667
I'm gonna get some air.

29:15.583 --> 29:17.542
Hi, Bella.

29:17.542 --> 29:20.375
What do you want to do
today, Bella, huh?

29:20.375 --> 29:23.917
You want to go to the park
with Mama? Hm?

29:23.917 --> 29:27.959
You're mad at me, huh? You miss
Jamie. Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

29:27.959 --> 29:32.583
I had to do it.
When you're 18 you can go
and find him and marry him

29:32.583 --> 29:35.875
if you want to.
But he just made Mama feel...

29:37.542 --> 29:39.417
...happy.

29:39.417 --> 29:42.417
I was going to say nervous,
but happy came out.

29:44.917 --> 29:49.583
Tell Dad I'll talk
to him later, OK? OK.

29:49.583 --> 29:52.750
Hey, Friend of Dave Greco,
how are you?

29:52.750 --> 29:58.625
- What did you say to him?
- Excuse me? I don't know
what you're talking about.

29:58.625 --> 30:01.291
And I actually don't
have a lot of time,

30:01.291 --> 30:05.583
but if you want to ride up
with me... It's your choice.

30:09.792 --> 30:11.333
He's an incredible talent.

30:11.333 --> 30:13.959
You can't make him fit his ideas
in some little box.

30:13.959 --> 30:16.291
Right, he told me.
So why are you here?

30:16.291 --> 30:18.375
He's a friend,
great at what he does.

30:18.375 --> 30:20.458
He deserves better
than you treated him.

30:20.458 --> 30:24.333
The way I treated him?
I rejected his idea.

30:24.333 --> 30:27.041
I'm not sure I'm responsible
for the way he takes it.

30:31.625 --> 30:35.375
- I don't know what games
you're playing...
- No games.

30:35.375 --> 30:38.208
Maybe your friend can't do his
job the way I want him to.

30:38.208 --> 30:41.959
Which, isn't that hard.
Maybe you guys had magic
at Zip Monkey...

30:41.959 --> 30:44.291
- Zap.
- Whatever. The point is,

30:44.291 --> 30:46.667
is that he had cool ideas
but that's all he's got.

30:46.667 --> 30:49.291
And that's not enough.
It's half the package.

30:49.291 --> 30:51.291
Now he needs
to put it all together.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.417
This is a new KC Gaming.

30:54.417 --> 30:58.333
He needs to step it up and show
me what he's has or he's gone.

31:00.917 --> 31:03.834
- All right. I have an idea.
- What kind of idea?

31:03.834 --> 31:05.875
Just give me
five more minutes.

31:16.250 --> 31:19.542
[Jamie] All right, guys.
Ready? Let's go.

31:19.542 --> 31:22.750
Ooh. You all right? All right.

31:22.750 --> 31:27.250
Hang on, baby.
We're going to get our man back.

31:27.250 --> 31:29.166
Come on. Come on, come on.

31:30.834 --> 31:33.417
- Jamie!
- Come on.

31:33.417 --> 31:34.750
Jamie!

31:35.667 --> 31:39.083
Nicole. Hey.

31:39.083 --> 31:40.667
Fancy meeting you here, huh?

31:42.709 --> 31:45.834
Whoo, it's hot.

31:45.834 --> 31:48.375
Do you already have a new job?

31:48.375 --> 31:52.208
Oh, no. Of course not.
These are, uh...
These are my brother's kids.

31:52.208 --> 31:56.500
- Vanessa and Cort.
- Hi, kids.

31:56.500 --> 31:59.000
This is the little baby
I used to take care of.

32:04.125 --> 32:05.291
Jamie.

32:07.458 --> 32:08.875
Bella, she just...

32:08.875 --> 32:11.875
Well, she can't talk
or anything, but...

32:11.875 --> 32:15.417
I know she really,
really misses you.

32:17.291 --> 32:20.875
And, um... can I un-fire you?

32:25.083 --> 32:27.750
You're gonna tell me
who you voiced in that game

32:27.750 --> 32:30.083
or I'm kicking you out
and keeping the drinks.

32:30.083 --> 32:31.750
- Are you threatening us?
- Yes.

32:31.750 --> 32:34.583
- Still not gonna tell you.
- Think of it as an audition.

32:34.583 --> 32:36.291
I could hire you right now.

32:36.291 --> 32:38.625
- It was Harry Who-Dun-It.
- Laura!

32:38.625 --> 32:41.792
You were going to tell him
anyway. You know you
can't keep a secret.

32:41.792 --> 32:43.417
- True.
- Harry Who-Dun-It?

32:43.417 --> 32:45.959
"A clue is ahead.
A clue is ahead."

32:45.959 --> 32:50.333
No. Try, "A clue is ahead.
A clue is ahead.
A clue is ahead."

32:50.333 --> 32:54.917
Oh, that's too weird.
Harry's in my apartment.
A toast to Harry.

32:54.917 --> 32:57.750
How about one
more toast to Brian.

32:57.750 --> 33:01.000
Oh, enough already. Come on.
OK, one more.

33:03.291 --> 33:04.458
There she is.

33:04.458 --> 33:08.291
Hi. So, what are we toasting?

33:08.291 --> 33:11.166
And please tell me it's not
still about the haircut.

33:12.959 --> 33:14.291
Uh... Well, I, um...

33:14.291 --> 33:17.250
Don't be modest.
Brian got a job at KC Gaming.

33:17.250 --> 33:19.917
- Yeah.
- That's great.

33:23.500 --> 33:27.709
Dave, I'm going to make
a milkshake. You want
me to... make for two?

33:27.709 --> 33:30.291
Yeah. Sure. Whatever's left.
I'll be right in.

with this stuff.

- Where you going?
- To the gym.

I was kind of hoping we'd get
a few minutes this morning.

35:22.125 --> 35:24.750
No, I'm sorry.
The 405 was a crawl.

35:24.750 --> 35:27.083
My back is killing me.
I really need to work out.

35:30.166 --> 35:33.250
- You all right?
- Yeah. Just tired.

35:33.250 --> 35:35.583
- Bridge.
- Yeah?

35:35.583 --> 35:38.667
I thought you'd be more excited
for me, getting a job.

35:38.667 --> 35:42.125
And I kinda thought
I'd be a little bit
more part of the process.

35:42.125 --> 35:43.959
Just feeling
a little distance.

35:43.959 --> 35:45.959
You were out of town.
It was distance.

35:45.959 --> 35:49.583
[laughs] You had to get two new
roommates to replace me

35:49.583 --> 35:51.417
while I was gone
for a couple of days?

35:51.417 --> 35:56.041
- Is that what this is about?
Them?
- Forget it.

36:10.667 --> 36:12.834
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:12.834 --> 36:15.959
- What are you doing here?
- You'd never believe
what your neighbor

36:15.959 --> 36:17.667
charged me
for this great view.

36:17.667 --> 36:20.500
- What are you talking about?
- That person in HR?

36:20.500 --> 36:23.709
You know, gives the ID badge?
Is that a he or a she?

36:23.709 --> 36:26.792
Depends on what week. What the
hell are you talking about?

36:28.375 --> 36:31.500
- Meet your new cubicle-mate.
- [Dave laughs]

36:32.792 --> 36:34.458
- What is this, a joke?
- No.

36:35.792 --> 36:39.458
Wait a second. How did you?
When? What?

36:39.458 --> 36:43.166
- We're back together
working again.
- Are you kidding me right now?

36:43.166 --> 36:45.125
- No.
- You're not kidding me?

36:45.125 --> 36:47.667
I could kiss you.
And it's not 'cause of the hair.

36:47.667 --> 36:50.166
- Don't do that.
- All right. Hug. Check it out.

36:50.166 --> 36:51.625
- All right.
- Give it to me.

36:51.625 --> 36:55.208
Fantastic. Oh, I can't believe
it. Buddy, that's awesome.

36:55.208 --> 36:58.375
- Aw, take a picture.
- Yeah.

36:58.375 --> 37:01.375
It's like the making
of Vision State all over again.

37:01.375 --> 37:04.667
OK. Can someone explain to me
what's going on here?

37:04.667 --> 37:09.166
Oh. Well, ask your friend.
He was practically
begging for a job.

37:09.166 --> 37:12.041
- You knew about Vision State?
- Well, of course I did.

37:12.041 --> 37:15.709
Did you really think I had
never heard of Zap Monkey?

37:15.709 --> 37:18.041
Come on, I'm not an idiot,
Brian, you know?

37:18.041 --> 37:20.125
I knew all about you guys.
Part of my job.

37:20.125 --> 37:22.792
So you... The whole time
you knew who I was and

37:22.792 --> 37:25.333
made Dave feel worthless
so we'd both think...

37:25.333 --> 37:30.083
Not think. It's because you are.
Better together.

37:30.083 --> 37:33.041
Dave made himself
feel like he was worthless.
That was not me.

37:33.041 --> 37:35.375
So this was your plan?
To get Brian here.

37:35.375 --> 37:38.250
- Could've just
offered me a job.
- Yeah, no kidding.

37:38.250 --> 37:42.625
Yeah, yeah, I could've.
But that's not really
how I like to do things.

37:47.917 --> 37:51.959
I tell you what, dude.
She is one tough nut to crack.

37:51.959 --> 37:53.583
Yeah, but easy on the eyes.

37:53.583 --> 37:56.417
Mm-hm. Oh, don't go there.
It doesn't end well.

37:56.417 --> 37:57.917
- Really?
- Trust me.

38:01.542 --> 38:03.875
You've been on Peter's team
for a while, huh?

38:03.875 --> 38:06.333
- Yeah.
- Hanley, right?

38:06.333 --> 38:09.875
Yeah, yeah. Peter... Peter's the
best. He's the reason I'm here.

38:09.875 --> 38:13.959
Literally. He is awesome.
All right. It's all yours.

38:13.959 --> 38:15.291
Great.

38:16.542 --> 38:19.792
Ah! I think
this one's yours.

38:19.792 --> 38:21.000
Oh, thanks.

38:29.333 --> 38:32.291
- Thanks.
- Very funny.

38:32.291 --> 38:33.750
What?

38:33.750 --> 38:36.458
That's great. The different
dates. Was that Jimmy's idea?

38:36.458 --> 38:37.959
What're you talking about?

38:37.959 --> 38:40.417
Making it look like
tampering with evidence.

38:44.291 --> 38:47.041
You know, Peter said you'd be
a good fit on this team.

38:47.041 --> 38:50.333
He thinks you're a guy
who knows what it takes
to get things done.

38:50.333 --> 38:51.542
Are you?

38:54.208 --> 38:59.000
- Right. That... That's me.
- Good.

39:22.000 --> 39:23.834
[phone ringing]

39:27.208 --> 39:31.834
- Hello?
- [Deena] Hi. Hi.
It's... It's me.

39:31.834 --> 39:36.333
- Are you...?
- Downstairs? Yes.

39:36.333 --> 39:40.250
- Is this weird?
- No, it's not weird.

39:40.250 --> 39:42.208
I kind of like it.
Saves me a trip upstairs.

39:43.291 --> 39:45.041
You know, uh...

39:45.041 --> 39:50.333
...when I, uh...
I saw you the other day

39:50.333 --> 39:53.041
- upstairs, I...
- Naked?

39:53.041 --> 39:55.041
Yeah.

39:55.041 --> 39:58.333
I started to remember...

39:58.333 --> 40:00.500
...I don't know. A lot of stuff.

40:02.458 --> 40:04.750
Yeah, me, too.

40:04.750 --> 40:08.458
Um, that's why I was calling.

40:08.458 --> 40:10.917
I wanted to ask you something.

40:10.917 --> 40:13.208
Sure. What's up?

40:14.917 --> 40:17.625
I wanted to ask you...

40:18.583 --> 40:21.083
...on a date.

40:21.083 --> 40:23.083
Like a real date, you know?

40:23.083 --> 40:27.458
Like... we just met
or something.

40:27.458 --> 40:30.417
[soft rock plays]

40:30.417 --> 40:32.917
Well, do you... do you want to?

40:34.166 --> 40:35.750
Do you want to?

40:35.750 --> 40:38.291
I am the one who is asking,
Dave.

40:38.291 --> 40:42.000
Yes. Yes, I do.

40:44.583 --> 40:46.166
[girl] Mommy.

40:46.166 --> 40:47.917
Oh, great.
One of the girls is up.

40:47.917 --> 40:50.959
Whoa. Hold on a second.
You got kids?

40:50.959 --> 40:54.834
- Bye.
- Bye.

41:28.917 --> 41:31.917
I'm sorry about firing you.
It was just really dumb.

41:32.917 --> 41:36.291
The truth is,
is that I had this...

41:36.291 --> 41:40.291
...dream the other night
and it sparked these
thoughts and...

41:40.291 --> 41:42.875
Well, it was...
it was sexual.

41:42.875 --> 41:46.291
The dream.
It was a sex dream about us.

41:46.291 --> 41:47.542
Having sex.

41:47.542 --> 41:49.500
Right. But it
didn't mean anything.

41:49.500 --> 41:53.333
Because I'm still
very hormonal and you're
the only guy around, so...

41:53.333 --> 41:55.709
I think it
was just my brain

41:55.709 --> 41:58.542
putting together these
elements that were just...

41:58.542 --> 41:59.875
- ...crazy.
- Crazy?

41:59.875 --> 42:01.500
Crazy. Because
it was something

42:01.500 --> 42:03.458
that would never
happen in reality.
