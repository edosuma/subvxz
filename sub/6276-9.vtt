00:12.333 --> 00:13.125
RAY:
Previously on  Ray Donovan...

00:13.208 --> 00:15.000
ABBY:
I think I'm in love with you.

00:15.083 --> 00:17.333
RAY:
You think fucking this guy

00:17.417 --> 00:17.792
is gonna make you feel better.

00:17.875 --> 00:19.542
But it won't.

00:19.625 --> 00:21.750
It feels pretty fucking
good right now, Ray.

00:21.834 --> 00:23.834
You need to stop seeing my wife.

00:23.917 --> 00:24.917
That's up to her.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.375
No, it's not.

00:28.917 --> 00:29.917
How do you feel now?

00:30.000 --> 00:32.583
Better than I've felt
in a long time.

00:32.667 --> 00:35.583
What did you find out
about my daughter?

00:35.667 --> 00:37.500
I think she's
in witness protection.

00:37.583 --> 00:39.417
That's a fucking lie.

00:39.500 --> 00:41.542
What else isn't true
about the story you sold me?

00:41.625 --> 00:42.291
You got your story.

00:42.375 --> 00:43.709
My reputation is on the line!

00:43.792 --> 00:45.792
It is all I have.

00:45.875 --> 00:48.083
STEVE:
Did you fuck Ashley last night?

00:48.166 --> 00:49.583
'Cause when I fucked
her this morning,

00:49.667 --> 00:51.458
I felt very close to you, Ray.

00:51.542 --> 00:53.709
I can't see you
for a while, Mick.

00:53.792 --> 00:54.625
MICKEY:
Who's the girl, Allan?

00:54.709 --> 00:55.333
I guess we both like

00:55.417 --> 00:56.875
to fuck black
chicks, Mickey.

00:56.959 --> 00:57.750
Oh, I don't fuck Claudette.

00:57.834 --> 01:00.083
I make love to her.

01:00.792 --> 01:02.583
(grunting, yelling)

01:02.667 --> 01:03.208
COOKIE:
Before I went to Folsom,

01:03.291 --> 01:04.625
I gave Re-Kon the money

01:04.709 --> 01:06.875
to start his label.

01:06.959 --> 01:08.625
$30,000.

01:08.709 --> 01:10.083
Did you take Cookie's
money or not?

01:10.166 --> 01:11.333
Man, fuck the money!

01:11.417 --> 01:12.458
It's about the kid.

01:12.542 --> 01:13.709
Morning, counselor.

01:13.792 --> 01:15.083
LEE: Cookie Brown
has no written contract.

01:15.166 --> 01:18.000
We're keeping the kid,
end of story.

01:18.083 --> 01:19.792
You're making
a big mistake, Lee.

01:19.875 --> 01:21.792
Wow. (coughs)

01:21.875 --> 01:23.250
This is your moment, son.

01:23.333 --> 01:24.667
You ready?

01:24.750 --> 01:26.417
How about you, babe?

01:26.500 --> 01:27.750
Ready to do
this with me?

01:27.834 --> 01:30.000
I love you, Marvin.

01:30.083 --> 01:31.667
Love you, too, Shawty.

01:35.417 --> 01:37.583
(gunshots)

01:42.000 --> 01:43.375
(crying):
Daddy?

01:50.917 --> 01:53.041

01:59.000 --> 02:01.083

02:11.542 --> 02:13.417

Bridg, I know you're mad at me.

03:07.917 --> 03:09.000
We can talk about it.

03:09.083 --> 03:10.583
There's a lot to talk about.

03:10.667 --> 03:12.959
But it's 2:00
in the fucking morning.

03:13.041 --> 03:14.333
Goddamn it, Bridg,
where the fuck are you?

03:14.417 --> 03:17.125
Will you answer
your fucking phone?
CONOR: Mom!

03:17.208 --> 03:19.333
Marvin's dead.
He got shot. Look.

03:21.500 --> 03:23.375
Marvin and Re-Kon.

03:30.250 --> 03:31.333
(ringing)

03:38.333 --> 03:39.917
ABBY (crying):
Ray...

03:40.000 --> 03:42.250
she's with Marvin.

03:42.333 --> 03:43.792
Marvin was killed!

03:43.875 --> 03:46.333
Something horrible happened.
She's with him, Ray!

03:46.417 --> 03:46.792
I have her.

03:46.875 --> 03:47.709
She's fine.

03:47.792 --> 03:51.500
Oh...

03:51.583 --> 03:53.166
Oh, my God.

03:53.250 --> 03:55.834
(sobbing)

03:55.917 --> 03:57.291
Where are you?

03:57.375 --> 03:59.542
I brought her to the apartment.

03:59.625 --> 04:00.041
Why would you do that?

04:00.125 --> 04:01.792
Bring her home.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.750
Put her on the phone.

04:03.834 --> 04:05.458
I need to talk to her.

04:05.542 --> 04:06.625
She just fell asleep.

04:06.709 --> 04:08.166
You want me to wake her up?

04:08.250 --> 04:09.792
Yes.

04:09.875 --> 04:11.500
Abs, she needs to rest.

04:11.583 --> 04:13.583
Bring her home
or I'm coming there right now.

04:13.667 --> 04:14.917
Listen to me.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.083
We'll be back as soon as we can.

04:16.166 --> 04:19.709
You stay home with Conor.

04:19.792 --> 04:21.709
She'll be okay, I promise.

04:22.750 --> 04:24.583
Ray?

04:35.750 --> 04:38.000
I got all the blood off.

04:38.083 --> 04:39.500
Yeah.

04:39.583 --> 04:40.417
Sit down, sweetheart.

04:53.166 --> 04:55.125
We need to go over something.

04:57.291 --> 04:58.542
You heard the shots,

04:58.625 --> 05:01.125
and then you saw
Cookie walking away.

05:01.208 --> 05:04.208
I didn't just hear the shots.

05:04.291 --> 05:05.208
I heard his voice.

05:05.291 --> 05:05.959
I know it was him.

05:06.041 --> 05:08.917
Listen, Bridg.

05:11.375 --> 05:12.542
This is the important part.

05:16.291 --> 05:17.750
Did he see you?

05:20.458 --> 05:20.875
I don't...

05:20.959 --> 05:24.125
I don't know.

05:24.208 --> 05:25.166
I need you to think
about it, sweetheart.

05:25.250 --> 05:28.250
Dad, just... I don't know.

05:32.458 --> 05:34.583
I'm sorry.
No more questions.

05:36.041 --> 05:37.333
I'm sorry.
It's gonna be okay.

05:37.417 --> 05:40.917
(crying):
It's not gonna be okay.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.834
It's never gonna be okay.

05:42.917 --> 05:45.750
(sobbing)

05:50.834 --> 05:52.750
I'm sorry.

05:52.834 --> 05:54.083
Come here.

05:56.959 --> 06:00.041
(phone ringing)

06:00.125 --> 06:00.917
Abby?

06:01.000 --> 06:03.417
Are you all right?

06:03.500 --> 06:06.959
That rapper that got killed,
that's Bridget's boyfriend.

06:07.959 --> 06:09.083
Oh, that's awful.

06:09.166 --> 06:10.250
Is she okay?

06:10.333 --> 06:11.458
I don't know.

06:11.542 --> 06:12.875
She's with Ray,
and he won't bring her back.

06:12.959 --> 06:15.250
I'm so scared.

06:15.333 --> 06:17.041
Well, what can I do?

06:17.125 --> 06:18.625
Will you go get her?

06:18.709 --> 06:20.208
What?

06:20.291 --> 06:22.291
I need you to go get her.

06:22.375 --> 06:23.959
Abby, I don't think
that's a good idea.

06:24.041 --> 06:24.542
Why?

06:24.625 --> 06:26.375
My husband has her.

06:26.458 --> 06:27.542
He won't give her back.

06:27.625 --> 06:29.041
You said you were all in.
Are you?

06:29.125 --> 06:31.041
This is different.

06:31.125 --> 06:32.583
All in is all in.

06:32.667 --> 06:33.083
I know you're scared.

06:33.166 --> 06:35.208
That's natural.

06:35.291 --> 06:38.208
But the best help I can give you
is for me to lk into this.

06:38.291 --> 06:39.834
I'll call you back, okay?

06:41.709 --> 06:43.542
(sighs)

06:44.792 --> 06:46.625
What do the cops know?

06:46.709 --> 06:48.834
They're still
processing the scene.

06:48.917 --> 06:50.000
Witnesses?
Not yet.

06:50.083 --> 06:53.959
Steve Davis says they're
canvassing the neighborhood.

06:54.041 --> 06:54.959
A lot of people heard it.

06:55.041 --> 06:57.750
Nobody saw it.

06:57.834 --> 07:00.000
Nobody saw Bridget
get out of the car?

07:00.083 --> 07:01.583
Not so far.

07:04.291 --> 07:05.458
All right.

07:05.542 --> 07:07.667
Get over to
the recording studio.

07:07.750 --> 07:09.000
Find out who saw Bridget there.

07:09.083 --> 07:10.500
I want to know
what they know,

07:10.583 --> 07:13.000
and more importantly,
what they're saying to the cops.

07:13.083 --> 07:14.959
Okay, boss.

50 bucks.

08:09.625 --> 08:10.959
The real thing is $2,500.

You can't tell the difference.

08:12.000 --> 08:12.834
That's, uh,
the one for Claudette, huh?

08:12.917 --> 08:14.750
Mm-hmm.

08:14.834 --> 08:16.625
It's elegant
but simple.

08:16.709 --> 08:18.542
It works
as a purse,

08:18.625 --> 08:20.041
or you can wear it as a clutch,
take the strap off.

08:20.125 --> 08:22.583

08:31.000 --> 08:33.166
Claudette.

08:33.250 --> 08:35.291
It's Mick.

08:35.375 --> 08:38.917
Listen, there's something
I gotta talk to you about.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.333
It's urgent.

08:40.417 --> 08:41.750
Call me back ASAP.

08:42.959 --> 08:44.166
That'll get her.

08:44.250 --> 08:47.166
(indistinct conversations)

08:53.000 --> 08:54.500
Hello.

08:54.583 --> 08:56.709
Where the fuck
have you been?

08:56.792 --> 08:58.834
Catching some rays.

08:58.917 --> 09:00.583
I've been sitting
in your hot-ass apartment

09:00.667 --> 09:01.750
for 20 minutes
while you're out sunbathing?

09:01.834 --> 09:04.709
I must have been going down
when you were coming up.

09:04.792 --> 09:05.750
What are you here for?

09:05.834 --> 09:07.792
You need to get a fucking job.

09:07.875 --> 09:08.125
I got a job.

09:08.208 --> 09:10.125
Uh-huh.

09:11.417 --> 09:13.667
I called that executive lady
at Paramount.

09:13.750 --> 09:14.959
Oh.

09:15.041 --> 09:16.000
She never got back to me.

09:16.083 --> 09:17.291
Well...

09:17.375 --> 09:18.250
You must've really
fucked that up,

09:18.333 --> 09:19.417
because now
we're both out.

09:19.500 --> 09:21.291
What the fuck
happened?

09:21.375 --> 09:23.500
Well, there's other studios
in town, you know.

09:23.583 --> 09:25.333
Yeah...

09:25.417 --> 09:26.959
Until they come through,
you need a job.

09:27.041 --> 09:28.583
A real job.

09:33.083 --> 09:35.709
Fucking Ray, huh?

09:41.291 --> 09:43.542
I see how my son has not made

09:43.625 --> 09:46.834
a material difference
in your life.

09:47.917 --> 09:52.333
Let me enjoy my little
time between careers here.

10:03.542 --> 10:04.709
You got a couple
of days.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.875
(phone ringing)

10:13.166 --> 10:15.000
Yeah?

10:15.083 --> 10:17.458
This is Detective Tod Anderson,
LAPD Homicide.

10:17.542 --> 10:20.375
Is Bridget Donovan
your daughter?

10:20.458 --> 10:21.792
Yeah.

10:21.875 --> 10:23.333
We need her to come in today.

10:23.417 --> 10:25.500
Look, could we do this
tomorrow morning?

10:25.583 --> 10:27.041
My daughter's very upset.

10:27.125 --> 10:29.375
This is an open
murder investigation.

10:29.458 --> 10:30.875
Two people are dead.

10:30.959 --> 10:32.875
Now, she spent the day
with the deceased.

10:32.959 --> 10:34.750
She might have been the last
person to see them alive.

10:34.834 --> 10:37.041
She needs to come in
and give a statement.

10:37.125 --> 10:38.083
Today.

10:38.166 --> 10:40.083
All right.

10:40.166 --> 10:41.458
I understand.

10:49.291 --> 10:52.709
Daddy, you... you don't
need to protect me.

10:52.792 --> 10:53.834
I want to go.

10:53.917 --> 10:54.417
I want to tell them
what happened.

10:54.500 --> 10:57.291
I know you do, Bridg.

10:57.375 --> 10:59.709
Right now,

10:59.792 --> 11:01.875
I need you to keep
what you saw between us.

11:01.959 --> 11:03.583
You mean keep it from Mom, too?

11:03.667 --> 11:06.709
It's a complicated situation.

11:06.792 --> 11:08.417
No, it's not.

11:08.500 --> 11:09.667
It's simple.

11:09.750 --> 11:12.125
I know that Cookie killed
Re-Kon and Marvin,

11:12.208 --> 11:13.750
and that's all I have to say

11:13.834 --> 11:15.291
and they'll arrest him.

11:15.375 --> 11:17.250
And I'm not scared.

11:17.333 --> 11:18.875
Sweetheart, it doesn't
work that way.

11:20.458 --> 11:22.750
You were stoned.

11:22.834 --> 11:24.583
They'll tear you
apart in court.

11:24.667 --> 11:28.000
This is what I do
for a living, Bridg.

11:28.083 --> 11:31.500
These are the kinds of things
I take care of.

11:31.583 --> 11:33.250
I need you to trust me.

11:34.417 --> 11:37.291
You understand?

11:38.500 --> 11:39.417
(sniffs)

11:39.500 --> 11:41.125
I think so.

11:50.166 --> 11:51.250
I'm so sorry,
sweetheart.

11:51.333 --> 11:54.959
I was so scared.

11:55.041 --> 11:56.667
I knew you were
with him all day,

11:56.750 --> 11:59.166
and I thought you must have been
with them when it happened.

12:07.875 --> 12:10.041
What happened?

12:10.125 --> 12:12.291
Where were you?

12:12.375 --> 12:14.917
Um... I'm tired.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.959
I'm gonna go
lie down right now.

12:17.041 --> 12:18.500
I'll go with you.
BRIDGET:
No.

12:18.583 --> 12:20.083
(footsteps climbing stairs)

12:24.709 --> 12:26.542
What was that about?

12:26.625 --> 12:27.458
She was high, Abs.

12:27.542 --> 12:28.917
She got stoned
with Marvin and Re-Kon.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.625
She didn't want you
to see her like that.

12:30.709 --> 12:31.792
"See her like that"?

12:31.875 --> 12:32.417
She's my fucking dghter.

12:32.500 --> 12:34.834
Are you out of your mind?

12:34.917 --> 12:36.333
I'm sorry.

12:36.417 --> 12:38.000
I should have
brought her back earlier.

12:38.083 --> 12:39.000
I'll be back.

12:39.083 --> 12:41.000
Where the fuck
are you going?

12:41.083 --> 12:42.250
I got business.

12:42.333 --> 12:44.333
Isn't she gonna have to talk
to the police or something?

12:44.417 --> 12:45.333
She was his girlfriend.

12:45.417 --> 12:46.500
Later today.

12:46.583 --> 12:47.417
In the meantime,
keep her off the phone

12:47.500 --> 12:49.000
and don't let her
out of the house.

12:49.083 --> 12:50.542
Is she in danger?

12:50.625 --> 12:53.125
No. She's gonna be fine.

12:54.083 --> 12:55.959
If she's safe, why can't
she leave the house?

12:58.834 --> 13:01.792
Just do what I'm asking
you to do, Abs. Please.

13:01.875 --> 13:02.959
Or what?

13:04.291 --> 13:07.166
(door slams)

13:10.542 --> 13:12.625
(door opens)

13:25.041 --> 13:26.917
Bridget, honey.

13:29.417 --> 13:33.041
Let's talk.

13:33.125 --> 13:34.375
Leave me alone.

13:34.458 --> 13:36.542
I want to sleep.

14:04.500 --> 14:05.500
(door closes)

14:05.583 --> 14:08.417
(line ringing)

14:10.208 --> 14:12.834
CLAUDETTE:
Hello.

14:12.917 --> 14:14.917
Hey.

14:15.000 --> 14:15.959
Listen.

14:16.041 --> 14:17.417
When can I see you?

14:17.500 --> 14:19.750
I told you,
I need some time, Mickey--

14:19.834 --> 14:21.083
after what happened.

14:21.166 --> 14:22.083
What happened?

14:22.166 --> 14:23.917
What was so fucking terrible?

14:24.000 --> 14:25.417
A little family disagreement.

14:25.500 --> 14:27.125
You embarrassed me.

14:27.208 --> 14:31.083
You told me I was invited
to the party, and I wasn't.

14:31.166 --> 14:32.750
I invited you.

14:32.834 --> 14:33.959
And you really

14:34.041 --> 14:37.125
hurt Daryll,
giving away that car.

14:37.208 --> 14:38.291
All right.

14:38.375 --> 14:39.458
What were you thinking?

14:39.542 --> 14:41.875
All right,
I made a couple mistakes.

14:41.959 --> 14:44.417
But I really need
to talk to you in person.

14:44.500 --> 14:45.041
It's urgent.

14:45.125 --> 14:47.583
Are you in trouble again?

14:47.667 --> 14:50.792
Not me; you.

14:50.875 --> 14:52.875
That's all I'm
gonna say on the phone.

14:57.542 --> 15:00.000
Hey, Mick.

15:00.083 --> 15:01.750
Guess who's coming over.

15:01.834 --> 15:03.125
You're shitting me.

15:03.208 --> 15:03.917
Don't act so surprised.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.875
We got a connection--
her and me.

15:06.959 --> 15:08.333
She like pot?

15:08.709 --> 15:11.625
She used to.

15:11.709 --> 15:14.125
Come to the store with me.
(giggles)

15:15.333 --> 15:16.041
Good thinking.

15:19.166 --> 15:20.583
(phone ringing)

15:20.667 --> 15:22.208
LEE:
I've been calling you
since 4:00 in the morning.

15:22.291 --> 15:25.834
I need you to come to the office
immediately and protect me.

15:25.917 --> 15:27.208
Relax, Lee.

15:27.291 --> 15:28.583
I'm a walking dead man.

15:28.667 --> 15:30.333
Two people are dead, Ray.

15:30.417 --> 15:31.625
I'll be there later.

15:31.709 --> 15:33.792
If anyone asks you,
keep your fucking mouth shut

15:33.875 --> 15:34.917
about that meeting
with Cookie yesterday.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
What do you think I am,
an idiot?

15:40.250 --> 15:42.166
(buzzer sounding)

15:53.667 --> 15:55.959
(buzzer sounding)

16:14.125 --> 16:15.250
(footsteps approaching)

16:32.542 --> 16:34.000
You read my article?

17:03.834 --> 17:05.834
He hasn't left
his house all day.

17:05.917 --> 17:08.083
Good.

17:08.166 --> 17:09.375
Boss?

17:10.667 --> 17:12.250
Don't do anything stupid.

17:12.333 --> 17:14.000
You know what
this guy's capable of.

17:14.083 --> 17:15.417
I need you to go, Av.

17:15.500 --> 17:17.333
(chuckles)
I'm not leaving.

17:17.417 --> 17:18.875
I'm not asking.

17:20.500 --> 17:22.417
I need to know
if he saw Bridget.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.125
Boss...
Please, Av.

17:24.208 --> 17:25.709
Go watch my family.

17:30.709 --> 17:32.667
(starts engine)

17:41.792 --> 17:44.667
(buzzer sounding)

17:52.750 --> 17:53.750
Whoever you're looking for

17:53.834 --> 17:55.959
is somewhere else.

18:01.041 --> 18:02.667
(Ray grunting)

18:04.041 --> 18:05.208
(gagging)

18:07.583 --> 18:09.250
Get his ass inside.

18:11.625 --> 18:14.542
(grunting)

18:17.417 --> 18:19.291
Is he wired up?
Check him.

18:20.625 --> 18:23.125
(grunts)

18:23.208 --> 18:24.500
(groans, gasps)

18:24.583 --> 18:26.333
(groaning, panting)

18:26.417 --> 18:28.291
What are you doing here,
Ray Donovan?

18:28.375 --> 18:29.750
You got a problem with me?

18:32.750 --> 18:34.500
You killed Marvin and Re-Kon.

18:34.583 --> 18:35.417
What are you
talking about?

18:35.500 --> 18:37.917
Everybody knows
I had beef with Re-Kon,

18:38.000 --> 18:38.709
but why would I
hurt the kid?

18:38.792 --> 18:40.792
He was my golden goose.

18:40.875 --> 18:43.041
(laughs)

18:43.125 --> 18:45.458
(groans)

18:55.500 --> 18:56.291
We both know why you did it.

19:00.125 --> 19:03.542
(groans, sighs)

19:07.875 --> 19:09.333
You out of your fucking mind?

19:09.417 --> 19:10.625
(panting)

19:10.709 --> 19:13.000
You shot him in the middle of
the street in fucking Hollywood.

19:13.083 --> 19:14.917
You don't think this is gonna
come back to you?

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
No. Someone  shot him
in the middle of Hollywood...

19:18.083 --> 19:18.875
but we don't know who.

19:18.959 --> 19:21.500
Because nobody saw it.

19:25.083 --> 19:26.417
You sure?

19:26.500 --> 19:29.125
Well, that's
what I hear.

19:29.208 --> 19:30.417
And if someone pops up...
(chuckles)

19:30.500 --> 19:33.291
...well, these things
take care of themselves.

19:37.291 --> 19:39.667
So, why did you
really come here?

19:39.750 --> 19:41.500
Fuck.

19:43.834 --> 19:46.667
(groans)

19:52.125 --> 19:54.333
Lee wanted to make sure
you're square.

19:54.417 --> 19:55.917
Oh, yeah?

19:56.000 --> 19:58.500
Well, we ain't square.

19:58.583 --> 20:01.125
The kid's gonna blow up now,

20:01.208 --> 20:03.792
and I should still
have the rights to the music.

20:04.750 --> 20:07.375
All right.

20:07.458 --> 20:09.000
I'll talk to him.

20:12.417 --> 20:14.417
And tell him I want
Re-Kon's catalogue, too.

20:17.083 --> 20:20.458
If he's so goddamn scared.

20:54.250 --> 20:56.125
(unzips zipper)

21:04.959 --> 21:06.667
Need a little help?

21:06.750 --> 21:07.792
Hmm?

21:07.875 --> 21:10.083
(chuckles)

21:25.417 --> 21:26.542
I'm sorry.

21:27.959 --> 21:30.625
For... for what?

21:30.709 --> 21:34.834
I just haven't been with a
girl in a really long time.

21:37.500 --> 21:39.375
Like... like...

21:39.458 --> 21:40.542
a year?

21:43.583 --> 21:45.542
Longer.

21:47.959 --> 21:50.333
How long?

21:51.250 --> 21:53.125
A really long time.

21:53.208 --> 21:55.291
(laughs)

21:58.333 --> 21:59.959
Well...

22:00.041 --> 22:03.208
I think that...

22:03.291 --> 22:05.625
you're very sexy.

22:16.125 --> 22:18.750
Maybe we could
just go slow.

22:22.250 --> 22:24.333
(chuckling)

22:25.542 --> 22:26.875
You're adorable.

22:26.959 --> 22:29.417
(laughs)

22:29.500 --> 22:31.500
I am?

22:31.583 --> 22:31.959
(laughing)

22:32.041 --> 22:34.750
My article...

22:34.834 --> 22:36.083
what's wrong with it?

22:36.166 --> 22:37.375
That guy--
your unnamed source

22:37.458 --> 22:40.792
that helped
the FBI catch Sully--

22:40.875 --> 22:42.667
it's Mickey Donovan, right?

22:45.166 --> 22:46.542
Sully and Mickey were
the biggest enemies

22:46.625 --> 22:47.834
in the freaking world.

22:47.917 --> 22:49.917
The FBI told me that
Sully trusted Mickey.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.083
Trusted him?

22:52.166 --> 22:54.417
Okay, last robbery
those two did together

22:54.500 --> 22:57.166
ended with Mickey stealing
a half million from Sully

22:57.250 --> 22:58.625
and giving it
to some fucking moolie

22:58.709 --> 22:59.917
he had a kid with.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.250
Plus, he ratted out
Sully's whole family.

23:03.333 --> 23:06.417
All his brothers--
they all died inside.

23:10.709 --> 23:12.667
The FBI said that Mickey
offered to get Sully

23:12.750 --> 23:15.125
out of the country as
a part of their sting.

23:15.208 --> 23:16.250
Listen to me,
I'm telling you...

23:16.333 --> 23:19.291
only reason Sully
goes to L.A.

23:19.375 --> 23:20.542
is to plug that asshole.

23:23.041 --> 23:26.125
You're being played.

23:26.208 --> 23:27.625
By Mickey and the FBI.

23:30.166 --> 23:30.792
(exhales)

23:30.875 --> 23:33.041
Why?

23:33.125 --> 23:35.625
Uh, how the fuck do I know?

23:35.709 --> 23:37.500
I just know you're being played.

23:45.917 --> 23:48.500
(door opens)

23:48.583 --> 23:50.500
ABBY:
Bridg.

23:50.583 --> 23:51.792
Are you hungry at all?

23:51.875 --> 23:54.667
No.

24:09.625 --> 24:10.959
I know it's so hard,
sweetheart.

24:11.041 --> 24:14.583
(sniffling)

24:16.917 --> 24:19.375
Losing someone like this
is the worst thing.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.750
It's a horrible
world sometimes.

24:25.834 --> 24:28.000
(crying):
You don't know what
you're talking about.

24:28.083 --> 24:30.875
That's not what's wrong.

24:30.959 --> 24:32.709
What is, honey?

24:32.792 --> 24:33.917
(sniffles)

24:34.000 --> 24:35.667
Leave me the fuck alone.

24:40.875 --> 24:43.041
Honey, look at me.

24:43.125 --> 24:45.500
(whimpering)

24:45.583 --> 24:48.250
Bridg...
(sniffles)

24:50.166 --> 24:53.458
I was in the car.

24:53.542 --> 24:56.291
I saw him shot.

24:56.375 --> 24:58.000
His head exploded.

24:58.083 --> 24:58.959
What?

24:59.041 --> 25:00.959
His head exploded,

25:01.041 --> 25:03.208
and some of his blood
got into my mouth.

25:03.291 --> 25:05.166
I tried to wash it out.

25:05.250 --> 25:07.875
It tastes like rust.

25:07.959 --> 25:11.250
I saw Cookie Brown shoot Re-Kon.

25:11.333 --> 25:13.333
And Marvin begged
for his life

25:13.417 --> 25:15.542
and he shot him
right in front of me.

25:16.625 --> 25:19.542
Sweetheart, why
didn't you tell me?

25:19.625 --> 25:21.625
Daddy told me
I couldn't tell anybody,

25:21.709 --> 25:23.291
but I have to.

25:23.375 --> 25:25.625
I need to say what I saw.

25:34.250 --> 25:36.375
(phone ringing)

25:36.458 --> 25:38.458
Shit.

25:38.542 --> 25:39.583
ABBY:
You motherfucker.

25:39.667 --> 25:40.166
You had our daughter lie to me?

25:40.250 --> 25:42.375
Yes. To protect her.

25:42.458 --> 25:44.250
I should fucking kill you!

25:44.333 --> 25:45.417
Listen to me, Abby.

25:45.500 --> 25:46.625
Bridget didn't see everything.

25:46.709 --> 25:48.750
She heard his voice,
and she saw him walk away.

25:48.834 --> 25:49.750
Any lawyer is gonna
rip her testimony apart.

25:49.834 --> 25:52.333
I don't care.
She should go to the police.

25:52.417 --> 25:53.417
She should tell them
what she saw.

25:53.500 --> 25:55.959
You don't understand
how dangerous this guy is.

25:56.041 --> 25:57.583
He already killed one kid.

25:57.667 --> 25:58.792
How do you know
he didn't see her himself, huh?!

25:58.875 --> 26:02.875
How do you know her life
isn't already in danger?!

26:02.959 --> 26:05.000
If he'd have seen her,
he'd have shot her right there.

26:05.083 --> 26:06.166
Oh, Jesus, Ray!

26:06.250 --> 26:07.041
That's the truth, Abby.

26:07.125 --> 26:09.291
Please just wait
for me to get home.

26:09.375 --> 26:11.291
You have to trust me.
I know this guy.

26:13.208 --> 26:14.583
You know him?

26:14.667 --> 26:15.959
Yeah, I know him through Lee.

26:16.041 --> 26:16.542
So this is about

26:16.625 --> 26:18.583
your dirty business.

26:18.667 --> 26:20.500
No, it isn't. Ab...

26:21.417 --> 26:24.125
Fuck.

26:25.750 --> 26:28.291
Thank God you're here.
He's gonna kill me.

26:28.375 --> 26:30.000
(groaning)

26:30.083 --> 26:32.333
I'm gonna fucking kill
you myself, you piece of shit.

26:32.417 --> 26:33.792
Two people are dead
because of you!

26:33.875 --> 26:35.333
Raymond, calm down!
You want this to go away,

26:35.417 --> 26:36.166
you got to give Marvin
and Re-Kon's music.

26:36.250 --> 26:37.250
All of it.

26:37.333 --> 26:40.000
Okay, I get it. Done.

26:40.083 --> 26:40.500
Absolutely not.

26:40.583 --> 26:43.000
He'll kill me!

26:44.083 --> 26:46.375
We're the trustees
of their estates.

26:46.458 --> 26:47.375
Those rights are ours.

26:47.458 --> 26:49.667
We're not giving them up.

26:49.750 --> 26:51.417
I wouldn't even consider it.

26:54.917 --> 26:56.792
Go after him, Ray!

27:06.709 --> 27:08.709
Raymond, why do we have to give
up these assets to a murderer?

27:08.792 --> 27:11.667
We got to honor the deal.
What deal?

27:11.750 --> 27:13.208
You need to trust me,
Ezra, please.

27:13.291 --> 27:15.667
Trust you? You should've come
to me two days ago.

27:15.750 --> 27:17.875
You didn't consult me on this.

27:17.959 --> 27:19.583
I was trying to protect you.
I don't like

27:19.667 --> 27:21.291
the way you've
treated me for weeks.

27:21.375 --> 27:22.583
We don't have time
for this, Ezra.

27:22.667 --> 27:25.166
You disrespected Ruth,
you disrespected the RGOCC,

27:25.250 --> 27:26.583
and you didn't handle
June Wilson.

27:26.667 --> 27:29.458
Bridget was in the backseat
of that car.

27:31.375 --> 27:33.792
Oh, my God.

27:34.291 --> 27:37.000
That shayna-maidele

27:37.083 --> 27:39.667
had to suffer
through something so terrible?

27:39.750 --> 27:41.709
We need to give him
what he wants.

27:41.792 --> 27:43.291
It's the only way
to be done with him.

27:45.166 --> 27:47.417
Done, Raymond.

27:49.458 --> 27:51.542
(sizzling)

27:53.667 --> 27:54.041
Hey, Uncle Bunchy.

27:54.125 --> 27:56.959
Burgers!

28:04.583 --> 28:06.375
There you go.

28:06.458 --> 28:07.750
Thank you.

28:13.792 --> 28:14.875
Like this.

28:23.166 --> 28:25.000
I thought you
didn't like mustard.

28:25.083 --> 28:25.834
(grunts)

28:25.917 --> 28:28.166
You want to try it
the Boston way?

28:28.250 --> 28:31.041
Yeah.
Okay.

28:31.125 --> 28:33.750
You got to put the tomato
and the pickles

28:33.834 --> 28:35.792
underneath the burger.

28:35.875 --> 28:36.959
Really?

28:37.041 --> 28:38.208
Oh, he doesn't like pickles.

28:38.291 --> 28:40.208
Yes, I do.

28:40.291 --> 28:42.667
(Patty chuckles)

28:42.750 --> 28:44.500
Bunchy,

28:44.583 --> 28:46.291
do you, uh...
do you cut yours

28:46.375 --> 28:48.000
in-in half in Boston or...?

28:48.083 --> 28:50.166
Oh, absolutely.

28:50.250 --> 28:51.250
(clears throat)

28:54.333 --> 28:55.917
Want me to cut that
for you, buddy?

29:03.291 --> 29:05.458
Good, huh?
(chuckles)

29:11.208 --> 29:11.875
SHORTY:
Hey, man.

29:14.458 --> 29:15.917
First-timer.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.417
Oh, okay.

29:17.500 --> 29:19.333
Well, do you know
what kind you want?

29:19.417 --> 29:21.667
What kind?

29:21.750 --> 29:23.458
I want pot.

29:23.542 --> 29:24.375
Well, we offer
two basic types.

29:24.458 --> 29:26.875
Indica and sativa.

29:26.959 --> 29:28.667
Which one, uh,

29:28.750 --> 29:30.917
puts a lady in the mood?

29:31.000 --> 29:31.375
(laughs)

29:31.458 --> 29:33.834
Try the indica.

29:33.917 --> 29:35.083
It's more of a body high.

29:39.083 --> 29:40.500
That's the one.

29:40.583 --> 29:43.125
Give me 50 bucks of that.

29:43.208 --> 29:44.959
Okay.

29:45.041 --> 29:46.750
Show him the Skywalker, too.

29:46.834 --> 29:47.917
Okay.

29:51.709 --> 29:53.792
Look at it.

29:55.875 --> 29:57.000
See what I'm saying?

30:01.291 --> 30:04.250
We could knock
this place off real easy.

30:15.166 --> 30:17.000
♪ ♪

30:39.458 --> 30:41.417
(line ringing)

30:41.500 --> 30:44.333
(phone rings)

30:44.417 --> 30:45.583
Yeah, Av?

30:45.667 --> 30:47.291
Boss, someone's here.

30:47.375 --> 30:49.959
It's that cop.

30:50.041 --> 30:52.500
Abby's friend.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.083
(splashing)

31:00.959 --> 31:02.583
You're really good
with him, Bunchy.

31:02.667 --> 31:06.542
He really likes you.

31:06.625 --> 31:08.041
I like him, too.

31:10.083 --> 31:12.250
CLIFFORD: All right,
I'm ready to get out!

31:12.333 --> 31:12.875
Just a minute.

31:12.959 --> 31:14.291
I can finish the dishes.

31:14.375 --> 31:16.417
You sure?

31:17.417 --> 31:19.000
Uncle Bunchy!

31:19.083 --> 31:21.125
I want Uncle Bunchy
to get me out!

31:21.208 --> 31:23.125
(chuckles)

31:23.208 --> 31:25.542
D-Do you... do you mind?

31:27.083 --> 31:28.166
Sure.

31:45.417 --> 31:48.500
Um,

31:48.583 --> 31:49.792
come on.

31:49.875 --> 31:50.500
Out you go.

31:50.583 --> 31:53.667
No, you got to lift me.

32:06.959 --> 32:09.542
Ow!

32:11.041 --> 32:12.166
Bunchy threw me.

32:12.250 --> 32:15.208
Cliff, honey, don't say that.

32:15.291 --> 32:15.667
What happened?

32:15.750 --> 32:18.500
You all right?

32:27.500 --> 32:29.583
(sighs)

32:31.542 --> 32:33.083
Who's he?

32:35.000 --> 32:36.667
I'm Detective Jim Halloran.

32:36.750 --> 32:38.375
I'm a friend of your mother's.

32:38.458 --> 32:41.750
My mother has no friends.

32:43.291 --> 32:45.583
Bridg, honey,

32:45.667 --> 32:47.417
let's sit down.

32:47.500 --> 32:49.333
You need to
listen to him.

32:58.500 --> 33:01.709
Your mom asked me to talk to you
about what happened last night.

33:01.792 --> 33:04.792
I understand you were

33:04.875 --> 33:05.709
in the car
when your friend was killed.

33:05.792 --> 33:08.458
(scoffs)
You told him?

33:08.542 --> 33:12.000
I had to.

33:12.083 --> 33:13.583
Does Daddy know he's here?

33:13.667 --> 33:16.667
Look, Bridget,

33:16.750 --> 33:18.542
I'm gonna keep this
between us.

33:18.625 --> 33:20.041
But the best thing you can do

33:20.125 --> 33:21.583
when you give
your statement today

33:21.667 --> 33:24.166
is to tell them
exactly what you saw, okay?

33:24.250 --> 33:25.875
We need you to help us
catch this guy,

33:25.959 --> 33:28.625
and we have a very small window.

33:28.709 --> 33:31.083
(door opens)

33:33.250 --> 33:35.166
Hi, Daddy.

33:52.041 --> 33:54.125
Bridget, go get your stuff.

33:54.208 --> 33:56.166
It's time to go.

33:59.792 --> 34:01.250
Get the fuck out of my house.

34:04.750 --> 34:07.667
I'll talk to you later.

34:09.500 --> 34:12.208
Call me if you need me.

34:14.583 --> 34:16.625
(door closes)

34:16.709 --> 34:18.000
Ray, I...

34:29.542 --> 34:31.834
Did you know
Mommy's boyfriend is a cop?

34:38.250 --> 34:41.291
Bridg, you got to
listen to me.

34:41.375 --> 34:42.875
You're gonna say
Re-Kon and Marvin

34:42.959 --> 34:44.667
were smoking pot in the car.

34:44.750 --> 34:46.667
They almost had an accident.

34:46.750 --> 34:48.625
You got scared,
told them to let you out.

34:48.709 --> 34:50.333
The car stopped at Sunset
and La Brea,

34:50.417 --> 34:51.000
and that's when
you got out.

34:51.083 --> 34:53.917
If I tell that bullshit story,

34:54.000 --> 34:55.166
he'll get away with murder.

34:55.250 --> 34:56.291
And you'll be safe,

34:56.375 --> 34:58.083
and that's all I care about.

34:59.750 --> 35:01.041
Sweetheart,
I know you're mad at me.

35:01.125 --> 35:01.667
I know you're mad at your mom.

35:01.750 --> 35:04.041
But if you name

35:04.125 --> 35:05.667
Cookie Brown,
they'll arrest him.

35:05.750 --> 35:07.542
Good!
And he'll do everything
in his power

35:07.625 --> 35:09.000
to stop you from testifying.

35:09.083 --> 35:10.458
I know that.

35:10.542 --> 35:10.959
I don't care.

35:11.041 --> 35:13.542
He killed Marvin.

35:16.750 --> 35:19.834
You know, the following
facts are true.

35:19.917 --> 35:22.834
Metal cannot liquefy

35:22.917 --> 35:26.792
at any temperature
below 3,000 degrees.

35:26.875 --> 35:30.208
There were no photos

35:30.291 --> 35:31.834
of the Pentagon taken

35:31.917 --> 35:34.333
the morning
before the hijackings,

35:34.417 --> 35:38.125
and the debris field of
Flight 93 is inconsistent

35:38.208 --> 35:41.542
with any non-combat plane crash.

35:42.792 --> 35:45.000
That's all I'm saying.

35:45.083 --> 35:46.250
This is an all-cash business.

35:48.625 --> 35:51.125
They don't even fucking
take credit cards.

35:51.208 --> 35:53.959
What the hell you think
I've been talking about, Mick?

35:54.041 --> 35:56.709
(chuckles)

36:03.917 --> 36:06.792
Bridget, look at me.

36:08.375 --> 36:10.583
He's a very dangerous person,
and there's only so much

36:10.667 --> 36:12.583
I can do to protect you.

36:12.667 --> 36:13.417
You understand?

36:38.500 --> 36:40.333
Hang back.

36:42.500 --> 36:43.500
(sniffs)

36:50.875 --> 36:52.667
Hi.

36:52.750 --> 36:54.083
How are you?

36:54.166 --> 36:55.542
It's hot.

36:55.625 --> 36:58.166
Yeah.

36:58.250 --> 37:01.083
You know, I did security
back in the day.

37:01.166 --> 37:03.417
Hard job.

37:03.500 --> 37:04.417
Underappreciated.

37:04.500 --> 37:08.458
They probably have you
sleep here, am I right?

37:08.542 --> 37:10.709
On a cot in the back?

37:10.792 --> 37:12.417
Enough talk.

37:12.500 --> 37:14.417
Yeah, back to work.

37:19.208 --> 37:20.583
So what do you think?

37:20.667 --> 37:21.000
Slam dunk?

37:21.083 --> 37:23.208
Far from it.

37:23.291 --> 37:25.792
They got security up the ass,
and that guard is packing.

37:25.875 --> 37:27.792
Eh, we'll figure
something out.

37:27.875 --> 37:28.500
(laughs)

37:38.417 --> 37:39.542
He-He's fine.

37:50.375 --> 37:52.667
Bunchy?

37:52.750 --> 37:54.792
I'm so sorry I did that.

37:54.875 --> 37:56.625
You didn't do anything.

37:56.709 --> 37:58.834
It was... It was an accident.

37:58.917 --> 38:00.250
I'm not his father.

38:00.333 --> 38:03.125
I shouldn't be giving him
a fucking bath.

38:04.083 --> 38:05.792
What's wrong?

38:05.875 --> 38:07.959
I don't know.

38:12.917 --> 38:16.041
I just get really...

38:16.125 --> 38:18.709
confused.

38:23.709 --> 38:25.750
A-A-About what?

38:28.000 --> 38:30.125
Were you ever...

38:30.208 --> 38:34.000
afraid that you were gonna
do something?

38:35.542 --> 38:37.166
But you knew in your heart

38:37.250 --> 38:41.500
that you didn't really
want to do it?

38:42.000 --> 38:44.041
Um, what...

38:44.125 --> 38:47.083
what-what are you talking about?

38:51.208 --> 38:53.333
I can't tell you.

38:54.792 --> 38:56.917
Bunchy, uh,

38:57.000 --> 38:58.875
you're s-scaring me.

39:00.166 --> 39:02.291
Well, I'm sorry.

39:12.333 --> 39:14.000
Please leave.

39:14.083 --> 39:15.750
CLIFFORD:
Mom?

39:15.834 --> 39:19.000
Cliff, honey...
stay in your room.

39:30.458 --> 39:32.917
Please go.

39:59.208 --> 40:02.625
Detective Todd Anderson.

40:02.709 --> 40:03.834
I'm Ray Donovan.

40:03.917 --> 40:05.625
I know who you are.

40:05.709 --> 40:07.041
Bridget?

40:07.125 --> 40:08.542
Yeah?
Thank you for coming down.

40:08.625 --> 40:11.709
Now, this won't take long.
I just need to ask you

40:11.792 --> 40:14.458
some questions about where you
were yesterday and last night.

40:14.542 --> 40:16.250
You ready?

40:16.333 --> 40:17.166
I guess.

40:17.250 --> 40:18.291
That's good
enough for me.

40:18.375 --> 40:19.750
Let's go.

40:19.834 --> 40:22.166
I'll make this go
as smoothly as possible.

40:22.250 --> 40:23.417
Uh, Mr. Donovan?

40:23.500 --> 40:24.208
I should've told you
on the phone--

40:24.291 --> 40:25.875
I have to talk to her alone.

40:25.959 --> 40:28.709
She's a minor.

40:28.792 --> 40:31.083
It's just an interview,
and that's how we conduct them.

40:31.166 --> 40:33.750
Is there a problem?

40:35.083 --> 40:36.500
I'm fine, Daddy.

40:53.375 --> 40:54.291
Where is she?

40:54.375 --> 40:56.500
They're already in there.

40:56.583 --> 40:58.917
They want to talk
to her alone.

41:12.625 --> 41:14.041
You had the man
you're fucking

41:14.125 --> 41:15.583
tell our daughter
what to do

41:15.667 --> 41:17.500
when her life
is at stake.

41:17.583 --> 41:18.583
Un-fucking-believable.

41:22.417 --> 41:23.875
I'm not saying sorry.

41:23.959 --> 41:26.125
Fuck you!

41:26.208 --> 41:28.834
Keep your fucking
voice down.

41:28.917 --> 41:30.625
We finished
recording the song.

41:30.709 --> 41:32.500
It was pretty late,
and, uh,

41:32.583 --> 41:34.583
Re-Kon said that
it was time to go home.

41:34.667 --> 41:36.208
They were gonna
drop me off.

41:36.291 --> 41:38.375
So, you got in the car
with Re-Kon and Marvin?

41:38.458 --> 41:40.041
Yes.

41:40.125 --> 41:42.333
And then what happened?

41:43.834 --> 41:44.542
We were driving.

41:44.625 --> 41:48.458
Uh, we were...
we were smoking pot.

41:51.375 --> 41:53.917
Bridget, I need to ask you
an important question.

41:55.583 --> 41:59.333
Were you in the car
when they were killed?

42:02.959 --> 42:04.125
No.

42:04.208 --> 42:06.917
You're sure?

42:07.000 --> 42:08.709
Yes.

42:08.792 --> 42:10.875
I got out at Sunset and La Brea.

42:10.959 --> 42:11.959
They left me there.

42:12.041 --> 42:14.166
Then I walked for a while,
and I called my dad,

42:14.250 --> 42:15.333
and he picked me up.

42:15.417 --> 42:18.250
You know how much trouble
you could be in for lying?

42:18.333 --> 42:19.333
I'm not lying.
So, you just happened

42:19.417 --> 42:20.500
to get out of the car
two blocks

42:20.583 --> 42:22.458
before these people
were murdered?

42:22.542 --> 42:26.250
You see why that's hard
for me to believe?

42:29.208 --> 42:30.959
Did your father
tell you to lie?

42:31.041 --> 42:31.667
No.

42:31.750 --> 42:33.250
Look, I know you're scared.

42:33.333 --> 42:35.208
I'm not scared.

42:38.083 --> 42:40.875
You're sure you weren't
in the car when they were shot?

42:40.959 --> 42:43.792
Yes. I got out
because Re-Kon was really high,

42:43.875 --> 42:45.917
and I didn't like
the way he was driving.

42:46.000 --> 42:47.417
Can I go now?

42:49.667 --> 42:52.083
Look, I know your father's
looking out for you.

42:53.625 --> 42:57.500
But who's looking out
for Marvin?

43:05.000 --> 43:05.458
Claudette.

43:05.542 --> 43:08.291
How was your drive?

43:08.375 --> 43:11.291
It was fine, Mickey.

43:11.375 --> 43:13.709
Come on in.

43:13.792 --> 43:15.959
(clears throat)

43:16.041 --> 43:19.500
This is just, uh...
this is temporary.

43:22.250 --> 43:22.834
Yeah.

43:27.208 --> 43:28.166
(quietly):
Yeah.

43:28.250 --> 43:31.166
I got you something.

43:34.250 --> 43:36.500
What's this?

43:36.583 --> 43:37.083
That's a gift.

43:37.166 --> 43:39.667
(chuckles)

43:39.750 --> 43:40.750
Open it.

43:46.000 --> 43:49.041
Pot?

43:49.125 --> 43:51.750
Don't worry-- it's indica.

43:55.041 --> 43:57.000
You said this was urgent.

43:57.083 --> 43:58.208
Yeah, uh...

43:58.291 --> 44:01.166
Yeah. Have a seat.

44:03.458 --> 44:06.875
It's about Allan.

44:06.959 --> 44:08.208
Allan?

44:08.291 --> 44:10.709
He's fucking around on you.

44:10.792 --> 44:12.542
What?

44:12.625 --> 44:14.875
I saw him at a party last night.

44:14.959 --> 44:16.625
He was with another woman.

44:17.709 --> 44:20.083
That's what you called me for?

44:20.166 --> 44:22.083
That's what this is about?

44:22.166 --> 44:24.542
I thought you would
want to know.

44:24.625 --> 44:26.709
Allan and I are...

44:26.792 --> 44:28.667
working on our marriage.

44:28.750 --> 44:30.750
Well, you wouldn't
have to work on it

44:30.834 --> 44:33.959
if you were married to me!

44:34.041 --> 44:36.041
You were supposed
to wait for me.

44:36.125 --> 44:37.542
20 years?

44:37.625 --> 44:39.208
I stole that money for you.

44:39.291 --> 44:41.792
Gave you a life.

44:41.875 --> 44:43.667
What'd you do?

44:43.750 --> 44:45.792
You married that
piece of shit!

44:45.875 --> 44:46.875
Mickey!

44:46.959 --> 44:50.917
I haven't exactly been
an angel in all of this.

44:51.000 --> 44:53.917
Allan and I,
we have our ups and downs,

44:54.000 --> 44:56.041
but we have a good life.

44:56.125 --> 45:00.041
Yeah. You got a great
setup out there.

45:00.125 --> 45:02.208
I got to give you that.

45:08.333 --> 45:11.250
All I ever wanted...

45:13.667 --> 45:14.834
...was for you to be happy.

45:20.667 --> 45:22.750
Bullshit.

45:23.875 --> 45:28.583
The only one you ever
cared about was yourself.

45:32.375 --> 45:34.125
Keep the bag.

45:34.208 --> 45:35.875
I got the real one at home.

46:00.375 --> 46:02.709
(door opens)

46:12.875 --> 46:14.166
Bridg?

46:14.250 --> 46:15.750
I want to go home now.

46:15.834 --> 46:16.333
What did you tell them?

46:16.417 --> 46:19.208
I told them the truth.

46:20.542 --> 46:22.667
I didn't see anything.

46:27.375 --> 46:29.834
Snowflake!

46:33.667 --> 46:37.542
I'm so sorry
about what happened.

46:39.291 --> 46:40.834
I love the little nigga, too.

46:40.917 --> 46:44.417
He had everything
in front of him.

46:45.959 --> 46:47.458
She's had
a long day, Cookie.

46:47.542 --> 46:50.500
We need to go.

46:50.583 --> 46:53.625
Understood.

46:53.709 --> 46:55.667
It's gonna hurt
for a while.

46:55.750 --> 46:57.583
It's gonna get better.

46:57.667 --> 46:58.542
Bridg?

46:58.625 --> 47:01.333
Let's go, sweetheart.

47:02.834 --> 47:06.458
Strong girl.

47:06.542 --> 47:09.417
You talk to Lee yet?

47:09.500 --> 47:10.917
You're gonna get
everything you want.

47:11.000 --> 47:13.583
Good. Glad he came around.

47:19.333 --> 47:21.375
Was that him?

47:26.333 --> 47:28.208
(car engine starts)

47:45.333 --> 47:48.250
(moaning, muttering in Russian)

48:10.542 --> 48:13.417
He wants me to do him
any time I can.

48:13.500 --> 48:16.333
That's our girl.

48:21.208 --> 48:24.041
Here you go, doll.

48:39.709 --> 48:42.083
You know what, Mick?

48:42.166 --> 48:43.458
We can do this.

49:10.291 --> 49:12.333
You want to fuck my wife?

49:12.417 --> 49:14.625
Fuck her.

49:14.709 --> 49:17.959
But if you do anything to put
my daughter's life in danger,

49:18.041 --> 49:20.333
I'll fucking kill you.

49:20.417 --> 49:21.834
That guy could've been
in cuffs right now.

49:21.917 --> 49:26.000
And you turned your daughter
into a liar.

49:32.792 --> 49:35.834
WOMAN:
Hey, Jim, you all right?

49:35.917 --> 49:38.041
It's okay. It's cool.

49:54.667 --> 49:58.166
Mama, I'm so sad.

49:58.250 --> 50:00.125
I'm gonna miss him.
