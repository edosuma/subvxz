WEBVTT

00:29.916 --> 00:33.041
Okay, let's make this quick. I've got
a conference call with the Dalai Lama.

00:33.041 --> 00:36.166
You know, his spiritual enlightenment
thing is really kind of hot.

00:36.166 --> 00:39.166
That may be, but his expense reports
are complete bullshit.

00:39.166 --> 00:40.541
Uh, isn't everybody's?

00:40.541 --> 00:43.958
I assume we're flying to Africa
for some kick-ass reason.

00:43.958 --> 00:45.583
How about we fast-forward to that?

00:45.583 --> 00:48.500
A former TCB asset
recently escaped from prison.

00:48.500 --> 00:49.708
Hang on.

00:49.708 --> 00:51.375
You had an asset in prison?

00:51.375 --> 00:53.250
Whoa, whoa. We didn't put him in jail.

00:54.250 --> 00:58.958
But we also didn't not
"not" put him in jail, if you follow me.

00:58.958 --> 01:00.541
Be almost weird if I did.

01:00.541 --> 01:02.750
He escaped with the help
of the Weather Underground,

01:02.750 --> 01:05.375
and they handed him off
to the Black Panthers.

01:05.375 --> 01:08.333
Two groups dead set
on overthrowing America.

01:08.333 --> 01:09.500
Let's take 'em down.

01:09.500 --> 01:14.208
Actually, let's not, and instead,
go get my runaway TCB asset.

01:16.625 --> 01:19.833
You gotta be kidding me.
Timothy fucking Leary?

01:19.833 --> 01:22.583
Timothy "Francis" Leary, actually.

01:22.583 --> 01:25.166
Writer, psychologist,
and all-around pretty cool cat.

01:25.166 --> 01:28.375
Not to mention a drug fanatic
who got fired from Harvard

01:28.375 --> 01:30.375
for dosing his students with LSD.

01:30.375 --> 01:31.541
- Damn it!
- What?

01:31.541 --> 01:32.833
I almost went to Harvard.

01:32.833 --> 01:36.250
And he didn't dose those kids, okay?
We did.

01:36.250 --> 01:37.583
Leary worked for us,

01:37.583 --> 01:41.708
running an ultra-secret psychotropic
drug research program called Project P.

01:41.708 --> 01:42.958
- Oh damn it!
- What?

01:42.958 --> 01:45.291
Project P
was right down the hall from my office.

01:45.291 --> 01:46.333
That's what that was?

01:46.333 --> 01:50.041
Cry about it later, because right now,
your job is to get him back, and quickly,

01:50.041 --> 01:51.541
because Nixon's after him too.

01:51.541 --> 01:53.291
- Nixon?
-  Oh man.

01:53.291 --> 01:57.041
He's got a raging,
throbbing, tumescent, purple-helmeted,

01:57.041 --> 01:59.083
very real hard-on for Leary.

01:59.083 --> 02:00.375
Thanks for the adjectives.

02:00.375 --> 02:03.041
Because of Leary's public advocacy
for psychedelic drugs,

02:03.041 --> 02:05.791
Nixon's made it
his personal mission to get him back.

02:05.791 --> 02:08.416
- We need to grab him before Nixon does.
- Why?

02:08.416 --> 02:10.291
Because he knows too much.

02:10.291 --> 02:13.416
Project P was
part of our mind-control research.

02:13.416 --> 02:16.833
The research someone stole
and turned into the sonic weapon?

02:16.833 --> 02:19.916
- The one from Vietnam?
- You think Leary's in on this whole thing?

02:19.916 --> 02:22.583
Well, that is what
gruesome interrogations are for, right?

02:23.500 --> 02:25.208
Okay. Now, you'll find him here.

02:25.208 --> 02:27.875
Thanks to a tracking device
we implanted in Leary years ago,

02:27.875 --> 02:29.166
we know right where he is.

02:29.166 --> 02:31.666
- Implanted? You mean, like, surgically?

02:31.666 --> 02:34.500
Oh! You know a better way to do it?

02:35.125 --> 02:37.791
No, seriously. I'm asking.

02:37.791 --> 02:40.625
Because a lot of my surgeries
don't end well.

02:41.166 --> 02:43.916
By the way,
wouldn't go in there if I were you.

02:43.916 --> 02:46.291
And not for the normal reasons.

02:46.291 --> 02:48.083
-  Howard!
- Right.

02:48.791 --> 02:49.916
You'll need this.

02:51.291 --> 02:53.500
What... What am I, your fucking secretary?

02:53.500 --> 02:54.583
Works for me.

02:54.583 --> 02:56.750
That can track the signal
from Leary's implant.

02:56.750 --> 02:58.208
Looks pretty damn cool.

02:58.708 --> 02:59.750
What are these buttons?

02:59.750 --> 03:01.500
It's multifunctional.

03:01.500 --> 03:04.583
Can shoot a high-intensity laser,
play music,

03:04.583 --> 03:08.750
even programmed it to say
"I love you" in my father's voice.

03:08.750 --> 03:10.666
The way that asshole never did.

03:10.666 --> 03:13.291
Leary's holed up
at the Black Panthers' embassy.

03:13.291 --> 03:16.125
Now, normally,
he'd be under heavy guard, but today,

03:16.125 --> 03:19.125
George Clinton and Parliament Funkadelic
is throwing a concert.

03:19.125 --> 03:20.916
Love those colorful bastards.

03:20.916 --> 03:22.708
And a lot of Panthers are gonna be there.

03:22.708 --> 03:26.375
So, the embassy should be understaffed.
Perfect time for a snatch-and-grab.

03:26.375 --> 03:29.125
Since when do the Black Panthers
have an embassy in Algeria?

03:29.125 --> 03:31.208
Whoa, whoa, whoa. We're going to Algeria?

03:32.250 --> 03:33.416
Excuse me a sec.

03:35.166 --> 03:36.833
What the hell are you doing?

03:36.833 --> 03:42.416
I'm not what you'd air-quote as
"technically welcome" in Algeria anymore.

03:43.208 --> 03:44.125
Ever.

03:44.125 --> 03:46.708
They were extremely clear about that.

03:51.166 --> 03:56.083
You realize your half-naked genius just
shot himself out of this plane, right?

03:56.083 --> 03:58.041
What's your babysitter doing here again?

03:58.041 --> 04:01.958
I invited the lovely Miss Bertie
to join us to discuss some Elvis business.

04:01.958 --> 04:04.958
Yeah, which better include
me getting one of them jetpacks.

04:04.958 --> 04:06.666
Oh my God. You and jetpacks.

04:06.666 --> 04:08.291
Like a fucking broken record.

04:08.291 --> 04:11.125
Yeah, and maybe get me
a new secretary while you're at it.

04:26.166 --> 04:27.625
It's a nice day for a show.

04:27.625 --> 04:29.375
Ugh. Fuck you.

04:29.375 --> 04:32.291
It is literally 3,000 degrees here.

04:32.291 --> 04:34.125
A little sweat never hurt nobody.

04:34.833 --> 04:35.666
Wrong.

04:35.666 --> 04:40.125
Wrong. Sweating is the body's way
of saying it's dying, okay?

04:40.125 --> 04:41.333
Just so you know.

04:41.875 --> 04:43.750
Yeah. I can see that.

04:47.291 --> 04:50.708
Uh, instead of baking alive here,
I'm gonna go recon the embassy.

04:50.708 --> 04:52.291
Okay, but recon only.

04:52.291 --> 04:53.666
Don't go in there without me.

04:53.666 --> 04:56.500
Okay, overprotective and bossy. Got it.

04:56.500 --> 04:59.208
- You good on your own?
- Who do you think you're talking to?

04:59.208 --> 05:02.083
A middle-aged man
with a two-hour hair routine?

05:03.375 --> 05:05.500
I roll out of bed looking this good.

05:10.125 --> 05:11.458
Hey there, little lady.

05:11.458 --> 05:12.375
Can I help you?

05:12.375 --> 05:13.625
Here to see George.

05:14.625 --> 05:17.333
As in George "Dr. Funkenstein" Clinton?

05:17.333 --> 05:18.666
He's a good friend of mine.

05:18.666 --> 05:21.500
And you are who exactly?

05:21.500 --> 05:23.500
- Seriously?
- Not at all.

05:23.500 --> 05:26.875
Unfortunately, I know exactly who you are.

05:26.875 --> 05:28.000
Mm-hmm.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.583
Presley, Presley, Presley...
Nope, you're not on the list.

05:30.583 --> 05:33.291
Don't worry about it, sweetie.
George and I go way back.

05:33.291 --> 05:37.083
Oh, how nice for you!
But you're still not on the list.

05:37.083 --> 05:38.250
- Look--
- Now,

05:38.250 --> 05:40.791
if it was a list of people
who've stolen Black culture,

05:40.791 --> 05:42.583
then you'd definitely be on that one.

05:42.583 --> 05:44.333
- What are you talk--
-  Hey, Elvis!

05:44.333 --> 05:45.833
Elvis! Yeah, that's you.

05:45.833 --> 05:48.125
Let's get that funk on, brother.

05:48.125 --> 05:49.750
George, my man.

05:49.750 --> 05:51.666
Elvis on the mothership, y'all!

05:51.666 --> 05:53.125
If you'll excuse me.

05:53.125 --> 05:54.791
Try not to steal anything.

05:54.791 --> 05:55.750
That's Zara.

05:55.750 --> 05:58.208
She's a pain in the ass
with the clipboard.

05:58.208 --> 06:00.125
But damn, she can sing, man.

06:03.250 --> 06:05.083
<i>♪ Golden coins</i>... <i>♪</i>

06:05.083 --> 06:09.833
Now, Bertie... [chuckles] ...I know I told you
I was bringing you here to talk business...

06:09.833 --> 06:13.208
Which, if you ask me,
was some pretty low-grade bullshit.

06:13.208 --> 06:15.083
- I'm sorry?

06:15.083 --> 06:19.125
You really think you're the first man
to fly me all the way to North Africa

06:19.125 --> 06:21.125
just to try to get in my pants?

06:21.125 --> 06:24.458
Uh, one would assume so?

06:24.958 --> 06:27.083
You sound just like the fourth guy.

06:29.708 --> 06:33.208

06:49.375 --> 06:51.166
Ah! Stupid sweaty palms.

06:51.166 --> 06:52.541
Ah, fucking Algeria.

06:57.875 --> 07:01.291
Air conditioning. Ah, that's the stuff.

07:01.291 --> 07:02.583
God, I love the Black Panthers.

07:02.583 --> 07:04.583
<i>You're getting warmer.</i>

07:04.583 --> 07:05.708
Howard?

07:05.708 --> 07:10.000
<i>In case you just said
"Howard" out loud, like a stupid person,</i>

07:10.000 --> 07:14.500
<i>this is just my pre-recorded voice

07:14.500 --> 07:20.041
<i>as you track someone who apparently
survived one of my implant surgeries.</i>

07:20.041 --> 07:23.541
<i>Uh-oh. You did it, Howard.
You fucking did it.</i>

07:23.541 --> 07:25.750
<i>Even warmer!</i>

07:25.750 --> 07:27.416
<i>I'm proud of you.</i>

07:27.416 --> 07:30.166

07:35.375 --> 07:37.875
<i>Do you even know how temperatures work?</i>

07:38.583 --> 07:40.458
<i>Okay, warmer now.</i>

07:40.458 --> 07:41.875
<i>White-hot now!</i>

07:41.875 --> 07:44.416
<i>- Full-frontal! Money shot! Money shot!</i>

07:44.416 --> 07:46.791
<i>Whoa! Money shot! This is it!</i>

07:46.791 --> 07:48.166
Who the hell are you?

07:49.291 --> 07:52.625
Tall drink of gorgeous water?
Uh, yes, please.

07:54.166 --> 07:56.250
What the hell do you think you're doing?

07:56.250 --> 07:58.958
Ideally, something other than this
to you right now.

07:58.958 --> 08:00.375
Whoa! Hey...

08:01.250 --> 08:04.458
Go to sleep. Go to sleep, you sexy thing.

08:07.958 --> 08:09.916
Oh, well, this is fun.

08:12.833 --> 08:14.958
Hey. Hey, wake up.

08:14.958 --> 08:17.500
Hey, Dr. Strangelove, get the hell up!

08:18.958 --> 08:20.416
Stoned out of his mind.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.500
Must be some good shit.

08:25.833 --> 08:27.083
Amateur hour.

08:33.958 --> 08:36.666
God, you think prison would have
knocked off a few pounds...

08:36.666 --> 08:37.916
Oh shit! Shit!

08:37.916 --> 08:39.166
Shit!

08:39.833 --> 08:40.666
Uh...

08:41.333 --> 08:44.291
Hey, if you're alive,
I'm really sorry about that.

08:46.958 --> 08:48.166
Oh shit.

08:48.166 --> 08:49.083
Oh, you are.

08:49.083 --> 08:51.583
You know what? Now that you are,
fuck you for not inviting me

08:51.583 --> 08:54.416
to your never-ending
research party down the hall, dick.

08:58.375 --> 09:03.125
Don't look now, but I think someone's
about to steal their next hit song.

09:03.125 --> 09:05.083
- Didn't catch your name.
- Zara.

09:05.083 --> 09:07.625
Well, Zara, let's get one thing clear.

09:07.625 --> 09:09.250
My music's my music.

09:09.250 --> 09:12.250
And on behalf of Black people everywhere,
you're welcome.

09:12.250 --> 09:14.708
Now, look,
I know where you're going with this.

09:14.708 --> 09:15.625
But look here,

09:15.625 --> 09:19.166
rock and roll and rhythm and blues
were here a long time before I came along.

09:19.166 --> 09:21.000
I know where the music came from,

09:21.000 --> 09:25.125
and let's face it, I also know I'm never
gonna sing as great as Fats Domino,

09:25.125 --> 09:27.416
but I grew up on this kind of music.

09:27.416 --> 09:29.208
I love it, and it's in my blood.

09:29.208 --> 09:30.125
I can't help it.

09:31.083 --> 09:33.958
Moving, in a clunky, evasive kind of way.

09:33.958 --> 09:37.041
You know, there's a <i>JET Magazine</i> article
that clears a lot of this up.

09:40.125 --> 09:41.875
You got to be kidding me.

09:41.875 --> 09:44.875
Who the hell carries around
their own <i>JET Magazine</i> article?

09:44.875 --> 09:46.833
People who believe in being thorough.

09:47.416 --> 09:49.708
There's a lot of good stuff
in there on this.

09:52.375 --> 09:55.625
Oh, motherfucker!
What the hell happened to my van?

09:55.625 --> 09:58.833
Oh, yeah.
Some weird, stoned guy fell on it.

09:58.833 --> 10:01.625
Don't worry. I'm taking it
to get it fixed. Back in a jiff!

10:01.625 --> 10:04.333
Back in a what? What the fuck's a jiff?

10:04.833 --> 10:06.708
Oh fuck yeah, Black Panthers.

10:06.708 --> 10:08.125
God, you guys get me.

10:08.125 --> 10:10.125
Damn, this tea is amazing.

10:10.125 --> 10:12.916
The locals call it Maghrebi mint.

10:12.916 --> 10:14.000
I knew you'd like it.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.791
Well, we're extremely sure of ourselves.

10:16.791 --> 10:18.875
Well, your file is quite thorough.

10:18.875 --> 10:20.208
I have a file?

10:20.208 --> 10:21.458
Everybody has a file.

10:21.458 --> 10:23.291
- Why would--
- Everybody.

10:23.291 --> 10:25.125
Everybody. As in everybody.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.791
- How long is it?
- Long enough.

10:26.791 --> 10:28.791
I mean, like, how thick is it?

10:28.791 --> 10:30.916
Wait, we're talking about the file, right?

10:30.916 --> 10:31.833
What?

10:31.833 --> 10:35.000
Because it feels like we're hitting
a metaphor pretty hard on the head here.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.416
Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter.

10:36.416 --> 10:38.416
Ahem. Now, shall we...

10:39.666 --> 10:44.750
You seriously think I'm gonna get a room
with you in some random Algerian hotel?

10:44.750 --> 10:46.291
Just need to make a quick stop.

10:46.791 --> 10:50.875
By the way, was that a "no" to getting
a room in general, or just this hotel?

10:50.875 --> 10:51.791
Pick one.

10:54.875 --> 10:57.250
Man, you weren't kidding
about that sweating thing.

10:57.250 --> 10:58.416
Not helping, jackass.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.583
Also, we gotta go right now.

11:02.041 --> 11:03.166
Where'd you get the van?

11:03.166 --> 11:04.291
Same place I got him.

11:04.291 --> 11:05.833
What the hell?

11:05.833 --> 11:07.375
You already got Leary?

11:07.375 --> 11:09.666
The words you're looking for,
I believe, are "Thank you."

11:09.666 --> 11:12.375
Nice job. Missed a hell of a show though.

11:12.375 --> 11:15.916
Caught up with George, gonna have him over
to see Priscilla and the baby.

11:15.916 --> 11:17.250
Right. Yeah.

11:17.250 --> 11:19.000
I just scaled a building, you know,

11:19.000 --> 11:22.083
and stole a full-grown man
out of a second-story window, but,

11:22.083 --> 11:24.416
- yeah, let's talk about your stuff.
-  Hey.

11:24.416 --> 11:25.958
What do you think you're doing?

11:25.958 --> 11:27.875
That's my line.

11:27.875 --> 11:29.833
You're stealing our white guys now?

11:30.458 --> 11:31.833
Technically, she did.

11:38.083 --> 11:40.083
Are those guys after the van or Leary?

11:40.083 --> 11:42.833
Or maybe
the giant pile of guns in the back.

11:42.833 --> 11:43.833
Pick one.

11:43.833 --> 11:44.958
What guns?

11:44.958 --> 11:47.625
Oh! Well, hello.

11:51.250 --> 11:54.208
Hey, maybe wanna tell your buddies
to dial it back a bit?

11:54.208 --> 11:55.416
Hey, don't look at me.

11:55.416 --> 11:57.916
You guys started it.
You came onto our sovereign soil.

11:57.916 --> 12:00.333
-  What soil?
- Our embassy.

12:00.333 --> 12:04.541
We're a government in exile dedicated
to fighting America's repressive system.

12:04.541 --> 12:06.208
Oh, preach it, sister.

12:06.208 --> 12:07.500
Don't do that.

12:07.500 --> 12:08.583
Yep. Sorry.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.041
Antoine!

12:15.041 --> 12:17.166
Nice to see you, Commander.

12:17.166 --> 12:19.500
Same here, my friend.

12:19.500 --> 12:20.666
Be right back.

12:24.041 --> 12:25.291
What the hell is that?

12:25.291 --> 12:27.500
An endangered baby white rhinoceros.

12:27.500 --> 12:30.125
I can see that. Why is it here?

12:30.125 --> 12:31.958
For dinner.

12:31.958 --> 12:32.958
Uh, excuse me?

12:32.958 --> 12:34.541
I read in your file

12:34.541 --> 12:36.875
how exotic foods
are one of your favorite things,

12:36.875 --> 12:39.416
so I took the liberty
of hiring a private chef nearby

12:39.416 --> 12:42.125
so you and I could enjoy
a quiet meal together,

12:42.125 --> 12:44.375
munching on our little friend here.

12:44.375 --> 12:47.208
Gotta say,
that does sound kind of romantic.

12:47.208 --> 12:48.125
Aw. Thank you.

12:48.125 --> 12:52.208
And it also happens to sound
completely fucking insane!

12:52.208 --> 12:54.250
Are you out of your bald-headed mind?

12:54.250 --> 12:56.875
Hey! "Exotic foods"!

12:56.875 --> 13:01.125
Which means frog legs!
Maybe the occasional sushi, you moron!

13:01.125 --> 13:04.375
Well, it's a little late
for this kind of input.

13:04.375 --> 13:06.416
I paid 20 grand for this fucking thing!

13:06.416 --> 13:09.416
That's over $100,000 in 2022,

13:09.416 --> 13:13.250
to put it in financial context
for no apparent reason.

13:13.250 --> 13:14.166
Fuck.

13:16.333 --> 13:19.250
Okay, I've had
just about enough of this shit.

13:19.250 --> 13:20.958
Hey, you can't shoot my friends.

13:22.166 --> 13:25.250
You mean the friends
trying to run us off the damn road?

13:25.250 --> 13:26.583
Not me. Just you.

13:26.583 --> 13:28.250
Do you know how car crashes work?

13:32.458 --> 13:34.541
Who the hell are these new assholes?

13:34.541 --> 13:37.166
No idea.
Definitely not Black Panthers though.

13:37.166 --> 13:39.208
So feel free to shoot those guys
all you want.

13:44.625 --> 13:47.083
Ah shit! Goddamn it! We lost the AC!

13:47.083 --> 13:49.958
Not really our chief concern right now.

13:49.958 --> 13:50.958
Since when?

13:50.958 --> 13:53.041
Just get to the damn plane.

13:53.041 --> 13:54.666
And hold it steady while you do.

13:54.666 --> 13:56.875
Whoa. You know how to use that thing?

13:56.875 --> 13:58.208
Pretty much, give or take.

13:58.208 --> 14:00.166
Not really the answer I wanted to hear.

14:00.166 --> 14:02.833
Take it easy. You just point and shoot.

14:02.833 --> 14:04.083
How hard can it be?

14:09.000 --> 14:11.583
Uh, harder than one
would think, apparently.

14:12.916 --> 14:15.875
Uh, well, this is gonna leave a mark.

14:30.166 --> 14:31.500
You guys okay?

14:32.000 --> 14:33.458
Whoa. Where the fuck's Leary?

14:33.458 --> 14:36.041
- Those assholes must have taken him.
- Oh shit.

14:36.625 --> 14:38.208
We gotta call the Commander on this.

14:38.208 --> 14:41.375
And tell him what?
That we just crapped the bed so hard,

14:41.375 --> 14:44.416
we blew up his fucking plane
and lost his drug buddy?

14:44.416 --> 14:45.750
Right. Don't call.

14:46.333 --> 14:47.625
Cool. I like your way better.

14:47.625 --> 14:48.875
Still got that tracker?

14:50.916 --> 14:51.791
<i>Cold!</i>

14:51.791 --> 14:53.666
<i>You're so cold right now.</i>

14:53.666 --> 14:57.791
<i>I don't even know why I bother trying!</i>

15:02.833 --> 15:05.375
Uh, what the hell are you doing?

15:05.375 --> 15:07.875
Oh, try the kebab. It's to die for.

15:07.875 --> 15:10.750
Not with your nasty fingers
all over it, it isn't.

15:10.750 --> 15:12.000
Humor me, Bertie.

15:14.583 --> 15:15.708
Mm.

15:15.708 --> 15:19.333
I'm not gonna lie,
that's some tasty barbecue right there.

15:19.333 --> 15:20.625
Right?

15:20.625 --> 15:22.625
Now try to keep
that positive frame of mind

15:22.625 --> 15:24.625
when I tell you we're being followed.

15:24.625 --> 15:25.750
- What?
- Four o'clock.

15:25.750 --> 15:28.291
Guy in the baseball cap
and his two buddies at six and eight.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.583
Don't look back.

15:30.583 --> 15:33.041
Then why the hell'd you tell me
where they are?

15:33.041 --> 15:34.958
Okay. No, that's a fair point.

15:36.375 --> 15:38.416
The tracker puts Leary out there,

15:38.416 --> 15:39.791
somewhere on that sub.

15:39.791 --> 15:41.375
Oh hell, yeah.

15:41.375 --> 15:42.833
Goddamn submarine fight?

15:42.833 --> 15:46.125
Exactly the kind
of badass spy shit I signed up for.

15:46.125 --> 15:47.416
You thinking what I'm thinking?

15:47.416 --> 15:50.833
Not unless you're also wondering
why I don't have my own submarine.

15:50.833 --> 15:51.958
No, I mean that.

15:56.416 --> 15:57.791
Now, you're staying here.

15:57.791 --> 15:59.375
No shit.

15:59.375 --> 16:02.291
And, this isn't
a "Black people can't swim" thing.

16:02.291 --> 16:04.708
This is a "You people
are out of your damn minds" thing.

16:04.708 --> 16:07.708
Now, look, you seem like
you got a good head on your shoulders.

16:07.708 --> 16:10.666
So, what are you doing running around
here anyway? You're just a kid.

16:11.583 --> 16:12.958
Thanks, White Guy Dad.

16:12.958 --> 16:15.000
Seriously. You should go home.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.916
Actually been thinking about that.
Maybe get back to my music.

16:17.916 --> 16:19.375
George mentioned you sing.

16:19.375 --> 16:21.666
Oh, honey, I can sing my ass off.

16:21.666 --> 16:23.333
I can sing circles around you.

16:23.333 --> 16:24.750
Pretty low bar there.

16:25.875 --> 16:28.250
If the music thing gets real,
give me a call.

16:28.916 --> 16:32.125
Also, here, to help with the ticket home.

16:32.125 --> 16:35.791
You know, you did
almost get me killed a couple times.

16:37.958 --> 16:41.833
And I'm betting you really don't
want me telling anyone about all this.

16:42.791 --> 16:43.625
Ever.

16:53.416 --> 16:55.416
Something I can help you boys with?

16:55.416 --> 16:56.791
Hand over the rhino.

16:57.375 --> 16:59.833
Sure. But maybe go fuck yourself first.

16:59.833 --> 17:00.875
Right now.

17:01.916 --> 17:04.791
You seriously think you can rip me off
in the middle of my date?

17:04.791 --> 17:07.333
Which isn't going that well, by the way.

17:07.333 --> 17:09.791
Fine. You want him?
Well, good luck with that,

17:09.791 --> 17:12.208
because I will
fucking waste this little guy!

17:12.208 --> 17:13.166
Jesus!

17:13.166 --> 17:14.416
Oi, no!

17:14.416 --> 17:16.125
Whoa, whoa, mate! No, wait!

17:16.125 --> 17:19.916
I'll splatter his endangered brains
all over the goddamn wall!

17:19.916 --> 17:22.541
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Take it easy. Take it easy.

17:22.541 --> 17:24.083
You don't need to do that.

17:24.083 --> 17:26.958
You know what? You're right. Here. Catch.

17:28.291 --> 17:29.375
Bloody fuck!

17:29.375 --> 17:32.541
Now, let's try that again.
You really think you can rip me off?

17:32.541 --> 17:35.166
That's... That's not what I'm doing.

17:35.166 --> 17:36.958
We're just trying to save it.

17:36.958 --> 17:39.291
- What?
- We're with Greenpeace!

17:39.833 --> 17:42.958
Swear to God! Please don't shoot!

17:44.625 --> 17:46.125
Okay, before you say anything,

17:46.125 --> 17:48.916
we both know I had no way of knowing that.

17:48.916 --> 17:49.916
That's it.

17:49.916 --> 17:51.625
I'm fucking out of here.

17:51.625 --> 17:54.125
Oh come on. You can't just...
You can't just walk away.

17:54.125 --> 17:56.083
Look, the little guy's growing on me.

18:20.291 --> 18:21.958
<i>Getting warmer.</i>

18:21.958 --> 18:23.041
Goddamn it.

18:32.625 --> 18:33.666
Maybe I should take that.

18:33.666 --> 18:36.541
Just use your little hand signals.
Maybe you could confuse them to death.

18:37.583 --> 18:39.541
Ugh. Jesus. Still?

18:45.083 --> 18:47.083
Well, lookie here.

18:48.541 --> 18:50.791
Oh Jesus Christ.

18:51.583 --> 18:54.666
- What are they doing with all these?
-  <i>Oh man! You're on fire!</i>

18:54.666 --> 18:57.625
<i>- Red hot! Oh yeah!</i>
- Damn it. Turn that thing off.

18:57.625 --> 19:01.250
- You turn it off.
<i>- Fuck you, Dad! Fuck you! I win!</i>

19:01.250 --> 19:03.250
<i>You're dead! I'm alive!</i>

19:03.250 --> 19:07.125
<i>Fuck you, Dad!
Oh yeah! So hot! So hot!</i>

19:10.291 --> 19:11.125
Go!

19:18.583 --> 19:20.375
Holy shit, we're going down.

19:20.375 --> 19:22.083
It's technically called "submerging."

19:22.083 --> 19:24.500
- What?
-"Going down" implies we're sinking.

19:24.500 --> 19:26.375
Oh okay!
Well, which one means we're fucked?

19:27.083 --> 19:28.208
Torpedo tubes.

19:30.500 --> 19:31.625
On it.

19:31.625 --> 19:33.541
Huh? What?

19:33.541 --> 19:34.958
Oh, now he wakes up.

19:36.791 --> 19:38.583
I can't hold this much longer.

19:40.625 --> 19:42.125
You better be right behind me.

19:42.125 --> 19:45.208
Don't worry. Multifunctional, remember?

20:06.041 --> 20:07.791
That! That right there!

20:07.791 --> 20:10.625
That's exactly why
I need a fucking submarine!

20:11.208 --> 20:14.000
Which I'm sort of wishing
we were back on right now.

20:17.333 --> 20:19.541
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- What?

20:19.541 --> 20:21.125
We needed that thing.

20:21.125 --> 20:22.666
Fuck you, I was winging it.

20:22.666 --> 20:25.500
Bringing that back
might've made up for blowing up the plane.

20:25.500 --> 20:29.125
Take it from a guy who actually
owns a plane. Not even close.

20:29.625 --> 20:31.333
You kids done chatting?

20:32.833 --> 20:34.791
Smile, you son of a...

20:42.833 --> 20:43.833
Nice boat.

20:43.833 --> 20:46.625
Borrowed it.
Figured you two might need a hand.

20:46.625 --> 20:48.791
Yeah. Appreciate the help.

20:48.791 --> 20:51.708
Well, genius, you're no good
to my music career if you're dead.

20:51.708 --> 20:52.625
Preach it, sister.

20:52.625 --> 20:53.916
Still no.

20:54.583 --> 20:55.583
Right.
