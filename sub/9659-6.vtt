00:04.341 --> 00:07.860
<i>In the shadow of Mont Blanc,

00:07.861 --> 00:09.060
Oh, my God. Cole!

00:09.061 --> 00:10.061
I'm so scared.

00:11.221 --> 00:12.660
Seriously, I'm afraid.

00:12.661 --> 00:14.380
I got you. You're hooked in.

00:14.381 --> 00:15.620
<i>..and scaled new heights.</i>

00:15.621 --> 00:17.060
Yeah, we're killing it.

00:17.061 --> 00:20.060
<i>At the Detour, Burnie and Ashley
couldn't get it together...</i>

00:20.061 --> 00:21.820
Can it go?
It broke.

00:21.821 --> 00:23.340
It broke?

00:23.341 --> 00:25.820
<i>..Korey faced off against Brodie
at the Road Block.</i>

00:25.821 --> 00:26.821
Yeah!

00:26.822 --> 00:28.381
Oh, my God.

00:32.901 --> 00:34.660
Well, that didn't work.

00:34.661 --> 00:36.140
<i>And Korey soared...</i>

00:36.141 --> 00:37.420
We did it!

00:37.421 --> 00:38.460
Oh, my God!

00:38.461 --> 00:40.940
<i>..giving him and Tyler
their second win.</i>

00:40.941 --> 00:42.340

Yeah!

00:44.181 --> 00:46.140
<i>Meanwhile, in a final showdown...</i>

That's the Matt.
-Is that Matt up there?

01:56.981 --> 01:58.980
Matt and Blair.
-Matt and Blair.

01:58.981 --> 02:00.300
Blair was fourth?

02:00.301 --> 02:03.420
Yeah, Blair and Scott came up.
-Let's go.

02:03.421 --> 02:05.140
You're liking that, aren't you?
-Hey, that's great.

02:05.141 --> 02:07.900
Are we allowed to talk
about race romance?

02:07.901 --> 02:09.940
(CHORTLES)

02:09.941 --> 02:10.979
We have had...

02:10.981 --> 02:13.021
It's been really nice to have
conversation with her.

02:14.061 --> 02:15.410
It's just been conversation?

02:15.411 --> 02:17.020
It's been really good
conversation.

02:17.021 --> 02:19.820
BRODIE: Blair is a very sweet girl,
so we'll see what happens.

02:19.821 --> 02:21.980
You know, maybe after the race
maybe take her on a date

02:21.981 --> 02:24.410
but right now, we're
focusing on the race.

02:24.411 --> 02:27.020
They both think the other's cute.
-Right.

02:27.021 --> 02:29.220
And they're just talking
and figuring that out.

02:29.221 --> 02:32.020
Brodie thinks I'm cute
so that doesn't mean anything.

..to Armenia - crossroads of the

02:57.061 --> 02:59.820
KOREY: The race thus far has
just been a dream come true,

02:59.821 --> 03:02.220
only finishing in either first
or second place.

03:02.221 --> 03:03.620
Wet shoes.

03:03.621 --> 03:05.580
TYLER: We've been neck and neck
with Brodie and Kurt.

03:05.581 --> 03:07.940
They are strong and competitive

03:07.941 --> 03:10.661
and they won't give up
as much as we won't give up.

03:11.861 --> 03:12.980
How are you?

03:12.981 --> 03:16.260
We are going to Yerevan.

03:16.261 --> 03:17.380
OK.

03:17.381 --> 03:19.900
TYLER: I don't know if it's
in our game plan

03:19.901 --> 03:22.180
to sabotage them in any capacity

03:22.181 --> 03:24.260
but it wouldn't hurt
if they messed themselves up.

03:24.261 --> 03:27.620
Today, they leave at 11am.

03:27.621 --> 03:29.340
It's the earlier.

03:29.341 --> 03:30.500
Thank you so much.

03:30.501 --> 03:32.381
Shuttle to the airport?

03:33.581 --> 03:34.900

-Let's go.

03:38.501 --> 03:40.500
Ooh!

03:40.501 --> 03:42.460
Alright, let's go.
-Alright, come on.

03:42.461 --> 03:43.780
Armenia?!

03:43.781 --> 03:44.940
Come on, Daddy.

03:44.941 --> 03:47.020
SCOTT: My perspective on my
daughter's abilities

03:47.021 --> 03:48.340
is growing every day.

03:48.341 --> 03:49.380
Travel agency.

03:49.381 --> 03:51.980
I've always thought that she was
my equal anyway

03:51.981 --> 03:53.300
but this is proving it out.

03:53.301 --> 03:54.340
Merci.

03:54.341 --> 03:55.820
BLAIR: Obviously,
he values education.

03:55.821 --> 03:58.580
He's done law school
and medical school,

03:58.581 --> 04:02.540
so when I decided not to do college
and take the social media path,

04:02.541 --> 04:04.020
I was scared I would
let him down.

04:04.021 --> 04:05.820
Bonjour, bonjour.

04:05.821 --> 04:08.100
So to hear him say he thinks
I'm his equal

04:08.101 --> 04:09.860
feels really, really good.

04:09.861 --> 04:12.060
My roommate in college was Armenian.
Let's go.

04:12.061 --> 04:13.460
Oh, OK.
-He was a hairy guy.

04:13.461 --> 04:14.461
We're going to Armenia.

04:14.462 --> 04:15.700
That's exciting.
-That's amazing.

04:15.701 --> 04:18.019
Let's go to Armenia!

we've been in dead last.

04:19.741 --> 04:21.779
Ooh-ooh-ooh!

04:21.781 --> 04:24.140
Last leg was terrifying for me...

04:24.141 --> 04:26.700
You're doing a good job.
I'm just afraid.

04:26.701 --> 04:27.940
It's OK.

04:27.941 --> 04:30.170
(MOCK SOBS)

04:30.171 --> 04:32.340
..and we wouldn't still be
in the race

04:32.341 --> 04:33.820
if my mum didn't encourage me to...

04:33.821 --> 04:35.460
Yeah, we would have been out.
-..take the risk.

04:35.461 --> 04:36.610
Cole, here.

04:36.611 --> 04:38.660
It's been pretty rough
but we're making it.

04:38.661 --> 04:40.170
We're both going to kick more butt.

Opens at 8am?!

06:05.341 --> 06:06.780
I think we chill till eight

06:06.781 --> 06:09.740
and we'll all be watching the same
performance together.

06:09.741 --> 06:13.020
And run hard because
an Express Pass is waiting.

06:13.021 --> 06:15.181
An Express Pass this late
in the game?

06:16.621 --> 06:18.941
This leg has an Express Pass.

06:20.821 --> 06:22.780
..so whoever gets it is
in really good shape.

06:22.781 --> 06:25.060
You can potentially be on your
way out and use the Express Pass

06:25.061 --> 06:26.660
and jump ahead of a couple of teams.

06:26.661 --> 06:29.900
It'd be nice because we're
always behind!

06:29.901 --> 06:32.260
And if you can get an edge,
in even just one challenge,

06:32.261 --> 06:34.101
it can make or break you
at this point.

I just tucked it in my pocket
and we went outside.

09:19.051 --> 09:21.770
Because all the teams are so close
together, you have to gain

09:21.771 --> 09:24.080
a little bit of separation,
however you can.

or this country's national bread -
lavash.

nine months to complete one.

10:57.251 --> 10:59.730
..can easily turn into this.

10:59.731 --> 11:02.610
But if they can make 15 lavash,

11:02.611 --> 11:06.290
they can break bread together
and get their next clue.

11:06.291 --> 11:08.450
We choose Bread.
-Let's go.

11:08.451 --> 11:09.770
I just don't know how to weave.

11:09.771 --> 11:12.330
You know where that is? How much?
-1,000.

11:12.331 --> 11:13.810
1,000?
-1,000.

11:13.811 --> 11:15.011
Alright.

11:16.011 --> 11:17.370
Come on, we're going to do Thread.

11:17.371 --> 11:18.531
We're going to do Thread.

11:22.411 --> 11:24.530
Do you have a clue? No?

11:24.531 --> 11:25.531
Open up.

11:26.531 --> 11:28.290
No clue?

11:28.291 --> 11:29.770
I don't want to mess up your...

11:29.771 --> 11:31.451
No clue?

11:33.531 --> 11:35.490
Nothing up your sleeves?

11:35.491 --> 11:37.930
No?! But you're the pretty one.

11:37.931 --> 11:39.530
No luck.

11:39.531 --> 11:42.011
I really need this clue.

11:45.491 --> 11:47.010
Thread or Bread?

11:47.011 --> 11:48.410
Let's do Thread.

11:48.411 --> 11:50.291
Let's do bread.
-OK.

11:53.411 --> 11:55.011
Ty, anything?

11:56.891 --> 11:57.891
No.

11:59.171 --> 12:00.810
Let's ask this guy, actually.

12:00.811 --> 12:02.530
Do you have a clue?

12:02.531 --> 12:03.651
Yes, I have.

12:06.051 --> 12:08.290
Thank you. OK, great.

12:09.411 --> 12:11.570
(WHISPERS) Oh, my gosh, Rach,
that was so easy.

12:11.571 --> 12:12.890
They found one?

12:12.891 --> 12:14.730
Ty, you want to go back down?

12:14.731 --> 12:16.010
Yeah, let's go.

12:16.011 --> 12:18.410
Come on.
-Let's go.

12:18.411 --> 12:20.211
It's got to be the stage.

12:21.691 --> 12:23.651
I don't think the clues are
going to be in there.

12:25.651 --> 12:27.570
Oh, my God! Thank you.

12:27.571 --> 12:29.890
What in the world?

12:29.891 --> 12:33.170
This is ridiculous.
Let's just find it.

12:33.171 --> 12:35.050
Oh, my gosh.

12:35.051 --> 12:36.450
This is stupid.

12:36.451 --> 12:37.971
(CHUCKLING)
No?

12:40.051 --> 12:43.731
If this is what gets us, not good.

12:50.224 --> 12:54.263
No-one has a clue?
Can I use this to go get a clue?

12:54.264 --> 12:55.823
This is stupid.

12:55.824 --> 12:59.783
Just cleaning up the joint
while looking for something.

12:59.784 --> 13:03.663
This is like Willy Wonka
looking for the Golden Ticket.

13:03.664 --> 13:05.583
Come on, Blair.
You're going to break something.

13:05.584 --> 13:08.023
Tyler, do I ask this guy?

13:08.024 --> 13:09.623
Do you have the clue?

13:09.624 --> 13:10.783
Yes.

13:10.784 --> 13:13.543
Ty, I think I got it.
-Are you kidding?

13:13.544 --> 13:15.663
What?! They got it.

13:15.664 --> 13:19.423
Where was it? Did you see?
-Yeah. That guy handed it to them.

for your next clue."

13:22.144 --> 13:25.583
"Search for the #Cascade on foot
for your next clue." -OK, let's go.

13:25.584 --> 13:27.184
That was pretty dumb.

13:28.704 --> 13:31.263
Phew! That was a run.
Do you want to open it?

13:31.264 --> 13:32.264
'Thread' or 'Bread'?

13:32.265 --> 13:33.344
OK, let's 'Thread'.

where this place is.

-Yes.

I'm watching her.
She's rolling it out.

Oh, dang!

What's she doing?

Like, something freaky.

Whoa!

14:20.144 --> 14:22.343
Alright, you're doing that,
and then done.

-Alright, let's get freaky.

We're going to learn how to do this.

15:48.224 --> 15:50.863
We had a pattern
so we had to follow the pattern

15:50.864 --> 15:53.943
and there's this crocheting
technique you had to do

15:53.944 --> 15:56.223
where you had to push it through,
wrap it round,

15:56.224 --> 15:57.863
tie a knot with just the hook,

15:57.864 --> 16:00.063
push it down
and then cut off the fabric.

16:00.064 --> 16:02.903
This is hard work to do
if they did this all day.

-Yeah? OK.

-Let's get in.

16:31.504 --> 16:33.543
Take a deep breath.
-Do you want a cough drop?

16:33.544 --> 16:35.743

I took too many deep breaths.

-Six maybe.

-No. Fell. (GROANS)

a little bit longer. -OK.

Come...!

This is so ridiculous.
It just keeps falling.

17:03.934 --> 17:05.022
This is ridiculous.

17:05.023 --> 17:06.623
Is it falling
when you're pulling it out?

17:06.624 --> 17:08.063
Maretta's laughing at me.

17:08.064 --> 17:09.863
Hold it. Hold it.

17:09.864 --> 17:12.863
Hold it till you can't stand it
and then let it go.

17:12.864 --> 17:15.022
It's burning me.
-What?

17:15.023 --> 17:16.103
It's burning me.

17:16.104 --> 17:17.343
Are you OK?
-Yeah.

17:17.344 --> 17:18.933
I can take the heat.

17:18.934 --> 17:20.664
My curling iron
does worse than this.

17:22.023 --> 17:24.173
Oh, you're doing pretty good, Mom.
-Am I? OK, good.

17:24.174 --> 17:26.424
I feel like we can do this
fairly fast.

17:28.424 --> 17:30.663
Can you hear them, like,
plucking the strings?

17:30.664 --> 17:32.864
I know. It's really like music.

17:36.144 --> 17:38.623
OK, so, we thought
we were going fast.

17:38.624 --> 17:40.503
Well, these other women
are just going, like,

17:40.504 --> 17:41.623

an instrument.

37:20.030 --> 37:22.459
I love you, Daddy!

37:22.460 --> 37:24.979
You're such a mechanic man!

37:24.980 --> 37:27.269
I feel like my only hope
is to help Scott

37:27.270 --> 37:28.979
get through his as quick as possible

37:28.980 --> 37:32.029
so that I might somehow
be able to pass Sheri.

37:32.030 --> 37:34.549
How can I help?
-Just fill them both up to the top.

37:34.550 --> 37:36.269
(SHOUTS) Can you get it, Mom?

37:36.270 --> 37:37.270
(GRUNTS)

37:37.271 --> 37:39.629
I here her moving her muscles.
(CHUCKLES)

37:39.630 --> 37:41.229
She's trying.

37:41.230 --> 37:44.909
I hate that I'm letting Cole down
so badly.

37:44.910 --> 37:47.229
(SNIFFLING) He's being so sweet too.

37:47.230 --> 37:48.230
(SNIFFLES)

37:50.350 --> 37:52.270
Come on, Mama!

37:54.940 --> 37:56.309
Sheri, don't give up!

37:56.310 --> 37:58.789
Mom, it's not...

37:58.790 --> 38:00.590
It's not your fault,
it's not our fault.

38:03.270 --> 38:05.309
(CRIES)

38:05.310 --> 38:06.710
I'm so sorry.

38:14.628 --> 38:15.666
So sorry.

38:15.667 --> 38:16.786
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

38:16.787 --> 38:17.896
You tried your best.

38:17.897 --> 38:19.786
Ev-everbody...

38:19.787 --> 38:21.546
It wasn't working for nobody.

38:21.547 --> 38:23.267
Why are you crying?

38:24.267 --> 38:28.426
I can't get it off. I've been
using this tool with a chain.

38:28.427 --> 38:31.066
And it just budges a little
and that's all it does.

38:31.067 --> 38:32.226
I can't get it off.

38:32.227 --> 38:34.026
But Mom...

38:34.027 --> 38:36.426
..we knew this...

38:36.427 --> 38:37.546
Aw.

38:37.547 --> 38:39.626
Don't...
(SOBS)

38:39.627 --> 38:43.146
I'm sorry if I got oil on you.
-I don't care. You're good.

38:43.147 --> 38:45.067
(SHOUTS) Don't give up!
-(SNIFFLES) OK.

38:47.416 --> 38:49.396
Dana and Matt,
you are team number four.

38:49.612 --> 38:50.867
We'll take it.

38:51.343 --> 38:52.983
SCOTT: Check it!

38:56.863 --> 38:58.382
Good job, Scott.
-Thank you.

38:58.383 --> 39:01.022
Sheri, let's try it one more time
while my cab's coming around.

39:01.023 --> 39:02.742
Oh, my God!

39:02.743 --> 39:04.822
Come on!

39:04.823 --> 39:06.022
I mean, the thing is like...
-OK.

39:06.023 --> 39:07.612
Look, I'm gonna tell you what to do.

39:07.613 --> 39:08.862
Feel this right here.
-Yeah.

39:08.863 --> 39:10.132
Pull on this.
-I have been.

39:10.133 --> 39:12.502
OK. You feel that? But you're
turning it the wrong way.

39:12.503 --> 39:15.342
That's the problem.
You gotta turn this 180 degrees.

39:15.343 --> 39:17.382
Stand on this side and pull it

39:17.383 --> 39:19.542
and you'll get that grip
you got right there.

39:19.543 --> 39:21.462
OK, I understand. Thank you.

39:21.463 --> 39:22.652
Thank you.

39:22.653 --> 39:25.103
Arggh!
-BLAIR: You getting it, Sheri?

39:26.263 --> 39:27.702
You got it?
It's off.

39:27.703 --> 39:29.062
Thank you, Scott!

39:29.063 --> 39:30.302
Cole, she got it!

39:30.303 --> 39:32.343
She's been turning it the wrong way.

39:34.303 --> 39:36.172
Tyler, you gotta run, buddy!

39:36.173 --> 39:38.462
On the one hand,
you wanna not help anybody.

39:38.463 --> 39:41.132
On the other hand,
you can't really not help Sheri.

39:41.133 --> 39:43.782
So...
-I know. She's so sweet.

39:43.783 --> 39:46.133
It sucked being in last place.

39:47.783 --> 39:48.783
And then there were two.

39:51.303 --> 39:52.822
Scott and Blair...
-Yeah?

39:52.823 --> 39:53.942
..you're team number five.

39:53.943 --> 39:54.943
Whoo-hoo!

39:57.263 --> 39:59.902
Can you check it?
-Oh, come on.

39:59.903 --> 40:01.022
Come on!

40:01.023 --> 40:02.062
Thank you.

40:02.063 --> 40:03.422
Let's go.

40:03.423 --> 40:04.782
Is it good?

40:04.783 --> 40:07.422
It's good?
-Mama, yeah!

40:07.423 --> 40:09.342
We've got to go. We've got to go.
-We've got to go.

40:09.343 --> 40:12.062
"Search through the grounds
for Phil." Alright, let's go!

40:12.063 --> 40:13.782
Mom, you did good!

40:13.783 --> 40:15.542
We just have to
get in front of them.

40:15.543 --> 40:18.382
He doesn't know where he's going.
-Can you turn around?

40:18.383 --> 40:20.063
(SOBS)
-Mom!

40:21.823 --> 40:24.502
We did so good.
Don't worry about it.

40:24.503 --> 40:26.062
Temple of Garni.

40:26.063 --> 40:28.742
Hopefully,
we are going the right way.

40:28.743 --> 40:30.342
(HORN HONKS)

40:30.343 --> 40:32.302
Was that another team?
-That was another team.

40:32.303 --> 40:34.582
(BOTH SPEAK INDISTINCTLY)

40:34.583 --> 40:36.173
Tyler and Korey.

40:37.383 --> 40:39.422
Now, maybe they're going the...

40:39.423 --> 40:40.423
I don't know.

40:40.424 --> 40:43.612
Searching the grounds for Phil.
-You know Phil.

40:43.613 --> 40:47.782
He likes to stand in cute spots
and do a nice pose.

40:47.783 --> 40:50.022
Maybe Tyler and Korey's guy
screwed up

40:50.023 --> 40:52.582
and we're going to get there
before them.

40:52.583 --> 40:55.942
(MUSIC PLAYS)

40:55.943 --> 40:58.653
It's been a long day!
PHIL: Oh, it's been a long day!

41:00.503 --> 41:01.862
(BOTH PANT)

41:01.863 --> 41:04.702
Tyler and Korey, you're
team number six. -(BOTH GASP)

41:04.703 --> 41:06.222
There's a lot of
heavy breathing going on.

41:06.223 --> 41:08.222
It was a day, Phil!

41:08.223 --> 41:10.822
After being first, second,
first, second, whatever...

41:10.823 --> 41:13.022
..being at the back of
the pack this leg

41:13.023 --> 41:15.822
helps us seem like less of a threat.

41:15.823 --> 41:17.652
Even though that might not have
been our intention,

41:17.653 --> 41:18.982
that is the silver lining of today.

41:18.983 --> 41:20.543
(BOTH PANT)

41:24.783 --> 41:26.382
(BOTH CONTINUE PANTING)

41:26.383 --> 41:27.462
Sheri...

41:27.463 --> 41:29.342
..you gave it everything you had,
didn't you?

41:29.343 --> 41:31.302
(SOBS)

41:31.303 --> 41:32.702
Hold your head high, Sheri.

41:32.703 --> 41:33.943
Don't beat yourself up.

41:35.263 --> 41:37.783
Unfortunately,
you are the last team to arrive.

41:38.783 --> 41:39.783
It's all good.

41:39.784 --> 41:41.422
That's the bad news.

41:41.423 --> 41:42.782
The good news is

41:42.783 --> 41:44.062
you're still racing.

41:44.063 --> 41:45.742
You're still in the race

41:45.743 --> 41:49.462
and you're about to start
the next leg right now.

41:49.463 --> 41:51.022
Sheri, you want to keep racing?

41:51.023 --> 41:53.612
I do.
-You can keep racing!

41:53.613 --> 41:55.862
We're excited.
We're grateful for the opportunity.

41:55.863 --> 41:57.422
Here we go!

41:57.423 --> 41:59.062
(SHOUTS) You can catch up!
You can do this!

41:59.063 --> 42:00.782
Everyone is probably going to laugh

42:00.783 --> 42:04.262
and say that's why you don't
let blondes change your oil.

42:04.263 --> 42:05.342
We're going to move up next leg.

42:05.343 --> 42:07.103
We've got a second chance
to give it our all.

Give me, like, 30 seconds.

I'm out of breath. I'm tired.
