00:03.245 --> 00:06.818
This is a Qum rug,
made from Persian silk,

00:06.887 --> 00:08.921
the most beautiful fibers
in the world;

00:08.989 --> 00:10.622
Also the most expensive.

00:10.690 --> 00:13.225
I love it.
It's so rich and warm.

00:13.293 --> 00:16.126
Now, there is one more piece
that I saw

00:16.195 --> 00:18.997
and thought,
"Heather just has to have this".

00:19.064 --> 00:21.366
The Buddha.

00:21.433 --> 00:24.302
- From the Thai highlands.
- For my yoga studio.

00:24.370 --> 00:26.304
You know how much I love
my practice.

00:26.372 --> 00:28.373
Let's have Michael bring it
downstairs.

00:28.440 --> 00:30.306
And I want you to take a look
at these wall colours.

00:30.426 --> 00:31.204
Great.

00:31.324 --> 00:33.576
You can show Michael
the perfect spot

00:33.644 --> 00:35.712
to put that Buddha
in the yoga studio.

00:35.780 --> 00:39.116
Oh. This old chest. Didn't you want
to get rid of it? More than you know.

00:39.183 --> 00:41.118
I'll have Michael
take it to the dump.

00:41.185 --> 00:43.186
You're an angel.
Thank you.

00:43.254 --> 00:45.355
I need to grab my notepad.
You guys go ahead.

00:45.423 --> 00:48.057
And don't forget
to pick a colour.

00:48.125 --> 00:50.159
Follow me.

01:45.980 --> 01:49.282
I need to talk to you.

01:49.350 --> 01:52.384
Rock Clay, or Burnt Sienna?

01:52.452 --> 01:54.819
Burnt Sienna all the way.

01:57.957 --> 01:59.757
Thanks again, Sandra.

01:59.825 --> 02:01.360
It was my pleasure.

02:01.427 --> 02:04.062
- I'll see you at yoga?
- Oh, yes.

Here.

03:02.037 --> 03:04.571
Thank you.

03:04.639 --> 03:06.572
Hey.

03:06.640 --> 03:08.208
Hey.

03:08.275 --> 03:10.276
What're you so smiley about?

03:10.344 --> 03:12.946
Maybe it's just that new
sexy hairdo of yours.

03:13.013 --> 03:16.216
No. What's going on?

03:16.283 --> 03:18.684
OK, I was gonna save it
as a surprise,

03:18.753 --> 03:20.787
but you know the panini shop
beside the club?

03:20.855 --> 03:23.488
- Yeah.
- It's up for sale.

03:23.556 --> 03:26.625
- That's my surprise?
- Yeah, that's your surprise,

03:26.692 --> 03:29.828
all right? I know. But just think about it.
All that square footage, right?

03:29.896 --> 03:33.497
It's right there, it's beside the club.
Faisal and I, we've become friends.

03:33.565 --> 03:36.267
He's gonna give it to me
at a good deal.

03:36.334 --> 03:40.471
OK. Um...
Wow. I mean, that's...

03:40.538 --> 03:42.640
- that's just a lot, right?
- Yeah. It is a lot.

03:42.707 --> 03:46.277
But I found an investor.
A friend of a friend.

03:46.344 --> 03:48.711
Apparently he's a good guy.
Jerry Gaines.

03:48.780 --> 03:51.547
OK, so, this is happening?
This is moving really fast.

03:51.615 --> 03:53.817
An opportunity like this comes
up, you gotta go for it, right?

03:53.885 --> 03:57.254
I can put in a VIP lounge,
a second bar.

03:57.288 --> 03:59.923
Really take it
to the next level, Mich.

03:59.991 --> 04:03.325
OK, no, you're right.
This is exciting. It is.

04:03.393 --> 04:05.427
I just, I mean, are you sure
you want to take on more debt

04:05.461 --> 04:08.030
- right now?
- I think I have to, you know?

04:08.098 --> 04:10.833
To stay competitive
with the downtown clubs,

04:10.901 --> 04:12.935
I gotta, I gotta step it up.

04:13.003 --> 04:15.104
I think it'll be good.
What do you think?

04:15.172 --> 04:17.139
- OK.
- Yeah?

04:17.207 --> 04:19.540
Yeah, I'm behind you
a hundred percent.

04:19.608 --> 04:21.409
That's why I love you.

04:28.483 --> 04:31.585
Come on in, kids. Sharpen your
pencils and open your notebooks,

04:31.653 --> 04:34.289
'cause we're starting the day
off with a history lesson.

04:34.356 --> 04:38.058
Who can tell me what this is?

04:38.126 --> 04:40.160
- I needed a change, OK?
- I think it looks great.

04:40.228 --> 04:42.162
- Very pretty.
- Thank you.

04:42.230 --> 04:44.164
- Guys?
- That's the <i>Andrea Doria.</i>

04:44.232 --> 04:46.867
Sank off the coast
of Massachusetts

04:46.935 --> 04:49.169
in, uh... what, '54?

04:49.237 --> 04:51.871
Fifty-six. Very close.
Gold star for him.

04:51.939 --> 04:55.374
With more than 50 dead, it remains the
worst naval disaster in US waters.

04:55.442 --> 04:57.343
Can anyone tell me

04:57.410 --> 05:00.012
what... this is?

05:00.080 --> 05:02.348
I think I can help here.
This is McKinney

05:02.415 --> 05:05.084
single malt scotch whiskey,
the pride of Scotland.

05:05.152 --> 05:07.986
And I can personally vouch
for its excellence.

05:08.054 --> 05:10.755
So, what does the pride of Scotland
have to do with <i>Andrea Doria?</i>

05:10.823 --> 05:13.058
Well, on board
the <i>Andrea Doria</i> was this,

05:13.125 --> 05:15.894
a case of McKinney 1947.

05:15.962 --> 05:19.564
It was recovered from the wreck and
holds enormous historical value.

05:19.631 --> 05:21.900
Nineteen forty-seven is
considered

05:21.968 --> 05:24.969
the finest year.
And these six bottles are

05:25.036 --> 05:27.471
the very last remaining
of the 1947 vintage.

05:27.538 --> 05:30.274
For scotch lovers,
this is the Holy Grail.

05:30.342 --> 05:32.943
It was held by one owner for
decades, but was recently sold

05:33.011 --> 05:35.312
in private
for an undisclosed amount.

05:35.380 --> 05:38.448
Which I can disclose to you. It
went for over a million dollars.

05:38.516 --> 05:41.851
- And you know this how?
- Because I know the man who bought it,

05:41.919 --> 05:44.587
David Brown.
The David Brown?

05:44.654 --> 05:47.656
The man who I pay $200 a month
to for my cell phone?

05:47.724 --> 05:49.425
I've known David personally

05:49.493 --> 05:51.827
since before he was
a telecom billionaire.

05:51.896 --> 05:56.731
Yesterday, David's wife Heather
fell victim to a con artist.

05:56.799 --> 05:59.401
That is not
just any con artist.

05:59.468 --> 06:02.704
That is Bridget Connoly.
She's been on my radar for ages.

06:02.772 --> 06:05.941
Mine too. She allegedly conned
the president of Air Belgium

06:06.009 --> 06:08.877
into buying a Banff ski resort
that doesn't exist. I thought

06:08.945 --> 06:12.613
she worked with a partner. Gone
solo, according to latest intel.

06:12.680 --> 06:15.883
Point is, she's good. No one's ever
gotten close enough to arrest her.

06:15.951 --> 06:18.286
Not yet.

06:18.353 --> 06:20.955
<i>My husband, he's quite</i>
<i>the avid collector</i>

06:21.023 --> 06:22.823
of rare vintages.

06:22.891 --> 06:25.592
The '47 is about as rare
as they come.

06:25.660 --> 06:27.227
How did you guys acquire it?

06:27.295 --> 06:30.530
Private sale. Our broker,
Tina, knew the original owner,

06:30.597 --> 06:32.232
who has since passed on.

06:32.300 --> 06:35.601
- Strange old man.
- Strange how?

06:35.669 --> 06:38.953
Well, he kept warning David that if he
bought the '47, he'd have to guard it

06:39.073 --> 06:43.108
- from this man who was obsessed with it.
- Did you get his name?

06:43.176 --> 06:46.111
No, but he said
he was really bad news.

06:46.179 --> 06:48.147
Maybe he was working
with Sandra.

06:48.214 --> 06:50.916
- How long did you knew her?
- About a month.

06:50.984 --> 06:54.420
And I must say, she didn't seem
like a con artist.

06:54.487 --> 06:56.155
The good ones usually don't.

06:56.222 --> 06:58.490
But my connection
with her was real.

06:58.558 --> 07:00.058
At least it felt real.

07:00.125 --> 07:02.393
And I love the things
she bought for my house.

07:02.461 --> 07:03.928
They were all perfect.

07:03.996 --> 07:06.464
Perfectly fake, as it turns out.

07:06.531 --> 07:08.532
She blanked out
all of the cameras,

07:08.600 --> 07:11.469
so we can't actually see how she
got the case out of the house.

07:11.536 --> 07:13.204
Well, I had

07:13.272 --> 07:16.373
complained to her about
an old trunk of my husband's.

07:16.441 --> 07:19.276
She had her mover take it away
for me.

07:19.344 --> 07:20.810
Did you get his name?

07:20.878 --> 07:24.348
Michael or Mickey, I think.
I didn't get a last name.

07:24.415 --> 07:27.384
- What about the truck?
- Just a regular old truck,

07:27.452 --> 07:30.487
no markings that I can recall. But
he must have been in on it with her.

07:30.554 --> 07:33.422
How could I have been so stupid?

07:35.459 --> 07:37.860
Well, even smart women get
conned sometimes.

07:39.729 --> 07:42.031
Hey. What's our status?

07:42.099 --> 07:44.100
We've got some units out
looking for Bridget Connoly.

07:44.167 --> 07:46.068
- Still nothing.
- OK, what about her vehicle?

07:46.136 --> 07:48.036
We got her plates from
a security camera. They were

07:48.104 --> 07:50.805
stolen from a car parked at
the airport long-term parking.

07:50.873 --> 07:52.933
No reports of a stolen Mercedes.

07:53.053 --> 07:54.805
We'll have Dev check in with
the luxury car rental companies.

07:54.925 --> 07:55.872
How'd it go with Heather Brown?

07:55.992 --> 07:59.047
Well, she said something about
the original owner's warning

07:59.115 --> 08:01.483
about someone obsessed
with the '47.

08:01.550 --> 08:03.683
Think this guy could be
connected?

08:03.751 --> 08:07.154
Could be. I have to admit,
I feel kinda bad for Heather.

08:07.222 --> 08:09.356
- You do? Come on.
- Yeah. She got taken in.

08:09.424 --> 08:11.358
Come on. You've gotta give it
to Bridget, though.

08:11.426 --> 08:14.694
Give her a little bit of a hand.
What she did took some skill.

08:14.762 --> 08:17.597
- If you think lying is a skill.
- Everybody lies,

08:17.665 --> 08:19.865
but a conman lies
with sophistication.

08:19.933 --> 08:22.735
My dad always said don't trust
anyone who lies for a living.

08:22.802 --> 08:26.406
I got something on Bridget's accomplice.
His name is Mickey Asano.

08:26.473 --> 08:28.607
He's the owner and operator
of Asano Movers.

08:28.675 --> 08:31.077
- How did you find him?
- It was easy.

08:31.145 --> 08:33.546
I just pulled his plate up
off the security camera feed.

08:33.613 --> 08:37.715
Maybe too easy.

08:37.783 --> 08:42.087
- Sure, I know her. It's Sandra Woodson.
- Real name's Bridget Connoly.

08:42.155 --> 08:45.257
And you helped her carry out a million
dollars' worth of product yesterday.

08:45.324 --> 08:48.226
Whoa, hold on. All I did was
move some furniture in and out.

08:48.294 --> 08:50.028
I don't know anything
about stolen product.

08:50.096 --> 08:51.995
Where's the trunk
that you helped her carry out?

08:52.064 --> 08:54.464
- It's gone. She came by and picked it up.
- What time?

08:54.584 --> 08:58.936
She was waiting for me this morning
when I got in, right at nine.

09:04.676 --> 09:08.344
Thank you.

09:08.412 --> 09:10.447
He has no idea
he was part of a con.

09:10.514 --> 09:12.949
So, the scotch is gone
and we're back to square one.

09:13.016 --> 09:14.717
I wouldn't say that.

09:17.188 --> 09:20.190
She rented a Mercedes 350

09:20.257 --> 09:23.125
from YYZ Luxury Car Rentals on Airport
Road under the name Julia Cohen.

09:23.193 --> 09:26.497
But wait, there's more. She traded
it in for a black Escalade.

09:26.617 --> 09:29.191
Way to steal my thunder.
Yeah, the manager told me that

09:29.311 --> 09:30.899
- this morning.
- OK. But to rent

09:30.967 --> 09:33.735
from the same company using
the same phony credentials?

09:33.803 --> 09:36.805
I don't buy it.
She's smarter than that.

09:36.872 --> 09:41.228
- After leaving Mickey, she headed north on the 427.
- Four twenty-seven?

09:41.348 --> 09:43.211
There's cameras posted
the whole way. We can track her.

09:43.278 --> 09:46.098
- I just need a timeline.
- She left around nine.

09:46.218 --> 09:47.148
Nine.

09:47.216 --> 09:49.117
All right, let's start
around that mark.

09:49.184 --> 09:51.785
Black Escalade, heading north.

09:51.853 --> 09:55.855
- All right, this might be it. Huh.
- Can you magnify it?

09:55.923 --> 09:59.626
Yeah. I think I can
get the plate.

09:59.693 --> 10:02.929
Got her. It looks like
she's getting off at Dixon.

10:02.997 --> 10:05.632
There's a camera at Dixon
and Airport Road.

10:05.699 --> 10:07.334
OK, there she is.

10:07.401 --> 10:10.370
She's turning into the parking
lot at the Ventura Hotel.

10:10.438 --> 10:13.139
- Let's pay her a visit.
- She'll be watching the doors.

10:13.206 --> 10:15.174
So we get her outside.

10:24.484 --> 10:27.385
The manager said one
of the valets dinged my car.

10:27.453 --> 10:30.755
Yeah, my partner's
rolling it up right now.

10:43.268 --> 10:45.702
- Where you headed, Bridget?
- My name's not Bridget,

10:45.770 --> 10:49.473
it's Chloe Robinson.
And that's not my car.

10:49.541 --> 10:53.243
So, if we search this car, we're not
gonna find anything incriminating?

11:01.851 --> 11:03.786
What do we have here?

11:05.755 --> 11:08.324
Looks like a few K in cash.

11:08.392 --> 11:10.359
Multiple ID's.

11:10.427 --> 11:12.961
It's not what it looks like.
I can explain everything.

11:13.029 --> 11:16.931
Yeah, I'm sure you can, Bridget, and I'm
sure not a word of it will be true.

11:24.439 --> 11:26.440
<i>So, Bridget...</i>

11:28.944 --> 11:31.145
where'd you hide the scotch?

11:34.316 --> 11:36.517
Do you have a buyer lined up?

11:39.020 --> 11:41.076
<i>Shark's going</i>
<i>to bite.</i>

11:41.223 --> 11:43.324
See, when we spoke
to Heather Brown,

11:43.391 --> 11:46.627
she told us that a dangerous man
wanted to buy the scotch,

11:46.695 --> 11:48.962
that he was like a shark.

11:49.030 --> 11:50.564
Is he your buyer?

11:52.700 --> 11:54.934
<i>They know</i>
<i>about Tarkanian?</i>

11:55.001 --> 11:58.304
Because we know you've been
talking to Tarkanian.

11:58.372 --> 12:01.307
You're good.

12:01.375 --> 12:04.711
Oh, you have no idea.

12:04.778 --> 12:07.012
- Toby?
- Yeah.

12:07.080 --> 12:09.180
A minute?

12:12.420 --> 12:15.987
This is Andrei Tarkanian.
He's Armenian-Ukrainian.

12:16.055 --> 12:18.490
Mercifully nicknamed The Shark.

12:18.558 --> 12:21.059
Made his fortune in human
trafficking in the early '90s

12:21.127 --> 12:23.094
and has since retired.

12:23.162 --> 12:25.429
Yeah, I read his file.
He kidnapped hundreds

12:25.497 --> 12:27.310
of underage girls and
pressed them into prostitution.

12:27.430 --> 12:28.580
He is a repugnant human being

12:28.700 --> 12:31.840
and a prime target of INTERPOL, But
he's also a man with appetites...

12:32.054 --> 12:35.289
women, wine,
but especially fine scotch.

12:35.357 --> 12:38.459
In my reads of Bridget, it looks like
she's trying to hook up a deal with him.

12:38.527 --> 12:41.661
Well, he'd be one hell
of a big fish if we can net him.

12:41.729 --> 12:44.631
- It would be a great career move.
- I'm not saying that.

12:44.698 --> 12:46.295
I know, this would be
a great bust. It just means

12:46.415 --> 12:48.710
that we have to work with her,
and I do not trust her at all.

12:48.830 --> 12:52.220
You shouldn't. She's a con artist. But
don't forget we have a secret weapon.

12:52.340 --> 12:54.751
She's not gonna pull one over
on us. Right, Toby?

12:54.871 --> 12:55.970
No pressure.

12:56.090 --> 12:58.375
- No pressure.
- No pressure.

12:58.495 --> 13:00.379
Bridget.

13:00.447 --> 13:02.481
Let's get to know each other.

13:06.953 --> 13:09.922
Nice photograph.

13:09.989 --> 13:12.557
Your father ran out on you
when you were an infant,

13:12.624 --> 13:15.060
and your mother raised you
until her death.

13:15.127 --> 13:17.328
You were... 16 years old?

13:17.396 --> 13:20.532
You have the file;
you tell me.

13:20.599 --> 13:25.370
Well, you were put
into foster care, you ran away,

13:25.438 --> 13:28.338
and you were recruited
by Jimmy "The Bricks" Foster.

13:28.406 --> 13:31.608
Are you writing my biography, or
do you want to talk about a deal?

13:33.644 --> 13:35.512
Give us the location
of the scotch, and I'll see

13:35.580 --> 13:37.847
what I can do about reducing
your charges against you.

13:37.915 --> 13:40.048
No. Let's talk

13:40.168 --> 13:43.520
about what I want, then we can
talk about what you want.

13:43.588 --> 13:47.223
You have the floor.

13:47.291 --> 13:50.659
You drop all the charges,
and I walk away.

13:50.727 --> 13:54.897
- I'll need further incentive.
- You want to catch The Shark,

13:54.965 --> 13:56.566
I can help.

13:56.633 --> 13:59.168
What exactly do you know
about Tarkanian?

13:59.236 --> 14:01.336
<i>More than he knows</i>
<i>about me.</i>

14:01.404 --> 14:04.739
I've never dealt with the man personally,
but I've dealt with people like him.

14:04.807 --> 14:06.841
Well, I'm pretty sure
that we can handle it.

14:06.909 --> 14:08.510
Really?

14:08.578 --> 14:11.446
He's never been caught by any
law enforcement agency anywhere.

14:11.514 --> 14:13.648
You can use all the help
you can get.

14:13.716 --> 14:16.217
All right.

14:16.284 --> 14:20.254
You help us bring in Tarkanian, I'll let
you skate the charges on the scotch.

14:20.322 --> 14:22.423
All the other outstanding
charges against you are

14:22.491 --> 14:23.991
still your problem.

14:24.058 --> 14:26.059
Deal.

14:26.128 --> 14:28.762
Tell us where the '47 is.

14:28.830 --> 14:32.532
Trident Storage
on Weston Road, Unit 517.

14:32.600 --> 14:35.368
I'll draw up the papers.

14:35.436 --> 14:38.671
It's been a pleasure
doing business with you.

14:41.475 --> 14:43.510
<i>Our latest intelligence</i>

14:43.577 --> 14:47.813
says that Tarkanian has bases in
Buenos Aires, Capetown, and Toronto.

14:47.881 --> 14:49.848
He puts up firewalls
between himself

14:49.915 --> 14:52.217
and the rest of the world, and
the only way to access him is

14:52.285 --> 14:54.186
through trusted middlemen
such as this man,

14:54.254 --> 14:56.921
Christian Dufrense.
He's a former appraiser

14:56.989 --> 14:58.923
at some of the top-end
auction houses.

14:58.991 --> 15:00.759
According to those
in the know, if you want to sell

15:00.826 --> 15:03.342
to Tarkanian, Christian's
the man to talk to.

15:03.462 --> 15:06.364
And luckily he's not hard to find.
He owns a very high-end club

15:06.431 --> 15:09.567
called the Montgomery.
It's uber elite.

15:09.635 --> 15:12.036
- Excuse me. Hello?
- So, we go to Christian's club,

15:12.103 --> 15:15.506
we tell him we have the '47,
and he leads us to Tarkanian.

15:15.574 --> 15:18.142
- Simple. Sounds like a plan.
- Except for the X factor.

15:18.210 --> 15:21.259
I know Bridget is working another
angle here. Have you been able to read her?

15:21.379 --> 15:25.081
Not much yet. She has incredible
control over her thoughts.

15:25.149 --> 15:27.450
- She's tough to read?
- She is tough to read.

15:27.518 --> 15:30.255
But it'll get easier. I'll
find the cracks.

15:30.375 --> 15:33.022
Guys. Very good news. The scotch has
been recovered. It's on its way

15:33.090 --> 15:35.292
- to lockup as we speak.
- Excellent.

15:35.359 --> 15:38.294
Tell them to beef up security. That's over
a million dollars' worth of merchandise.

15:38.361 --> 15:41.530
Yes, we wouldn't want your friend
to lose his precious whiskey again.

15:41.598 --> 15:44.032
- Scotch.
- Get to work.

15:50.674 --> 15:53.874
So, from this point forward, you
will be known as Sarah Watson.

15:53.942 --> 15:56.010
We have worked up
a back story for you,

15:56.078 --> 15:58.680
- so please get to know it.
- Thanks.

15:58.747 --> 16:00.481
I've done this before.

16:02.451 --> 16:04.385
Nice watch.

16:04.453 --> 16:06.187
You know it's fake, right?

16:06.255 --> 16:08.022
Actually, it's authentic.

16:08.090 --> 16:10.490
Sure it is.

16:10.558 --> 16:12.025
OK. Um, I will be working

16:12.093 --> 16:15.495
alongside you
as Rochelle Lawrence.

16:15.563 --> 16:17.564
What's our story?

16:17.632 --> 16:21.735
Well, you and the lovely Rochelle
here are high-end B & E specialists.

16:21.802 --> 16:25.137
We approach Tarkanian's man
Christian at his club tonight,

16:25.205 --> 16:28.374
and we show him this
to prove we have the goods.

16:28.442 --> 16:31.559
Christian is an appraiser. He
needs actual product to appraise.

16:31.679 --> 16:35.548
That's impossible. Klein won't sign off on
us using a bottle for a meet like this.

16:36.496 --> 16:39.314
IIB has a forensic lab, right?

16:39.434 --> 16:40.985
- Yeah.
- We need them

16:41.053 --> 16:43.321
to mock up an empty bottle
of the '47. Are they capable?

16:43.389 --> 16:45.423
- The best in the country.
- Get them on it.

16:45.491 --> 16:49.160
Now I'm going to tell you the play,
and I want you to listen carefully,

16:49.228 --> 16:51.195
because I'm only gonna
tell you once.

16:51.264 --> 16:53.531
The mock-up bottle is called
"the show". We're gonna fill it

16:53.599 --> 16:56.267
<i>with store-bought McKinney,</i>
<i>25 year.</i>

16:56.334 --> 17:00.271
<i>We present the show tonight. I
draw and sample using a syringe.</i>

17:00.338 --> 17:03.140
<i>I squirt the sample into a test tube.
I give Christian the test tube</i>

17:03.207 --> 17:05.242
so he can do
a gas chromatograph analysis.

17:05.310 --> 17:07.645
What Christian doesn't know is
that I've swapped

17:07.712 --> 17:10.748
the show scotch with a sample
of the real '47 McKinney.

17:10.815 --> 17:12.982
And how do we get our hands
on the real sample?

17:13.049 --> 17:15.351
We only need 10 mils.

17:15.419 --> 17:17.720
Your boss is friends
with the owner, right?

17:17.788 --> 17:20.089
- How did you know that?
- I do my research.

17:20.156 --> 17:23.492
Tell Brown that his precious '47
will never be safe

17:23.560 --> 17:28.263
with Tarkanian out there. It's in his
best interest to help us take him down.

17:28.330 --> 17:31.433
OK, I'll ask Klein
to speak with Brown.

17:31.501 --> 17:34.135
<i>All according</i>
<i>to the plan.</i>

17:34.203 --> 17:37.272
Oh, another thing. If you can get
your hands on Christian's cell phone

17:37.340 --> 17:39.775
and grab his SIM card, it'll
help us; we can clone his phone.

17:39.842 --> 17:41.843
But he'll see you
pulling out the SIM card.

17:41.911 --> 17:44.378
There's a better way to do it.
All you need

17:44.446 --> 17:47.147
to clone a cell is
an ESN and MAC address.

17:47.215 --> 17:49.116
This is yours.

17:51.620 --> 17:53.287
What?

17:53.355 --> 17:55.423
I palmed it while admiring
your "authentic" watch.

17:55.490 --> 17:58.759
A few keystrokes
and I'd have all I need.

18:05.566 --> 18:07.334
You play the game well.

18:07.401 --> 18:09.502
Well, if you're not
playing the game,

18:09.570 --> 18:12.539
the game's playing you.

18:12.606 --> 18:15.342
Let you in
on a little secret, though.

18:15.409 --> 18:17.343
I'm done with it.

18:17.410 --> 18:19.077
All of it.

18:19.145 --> 18:20.679
I've heard that before.

18:20.747 --> 18:22.280
Happens to be true.

18:22.349 --> 18:25.351
I look at other people.

18:25.418 --> 18:27.353
They have real jobs,

18:27.420 --> 18:29.555
real boyfriends.

18:29.622 --> 18:32.190
I don't think
I'll ever have that.

18:32.258 --> 18:34.492
You're a smart girl.

18:34.560 --> 18:36.494
You can get whatever you want.

18:36.562 --> 18:38.596
Is that right?

18:48.373 --> 18:50.607
Hey

18:50.675 --> 18:52.676
I need you on op tonight
with Dev.

18:52.744 --> 18:54.244
Huh?

18:54.311 --> 18:56.913
- Are you going to be ready?
- Yeah. I'll be there.

19:03.888 --> 19:05.888
All right, all right!

19:05.955 --> 19:09.224
Who's ready for a frosty-cold
game of NBA action

19:09.292 --> 19:12.294
and a down-to-the-wire
back-and-forth beer?

19:12.362 --> 19:14.329
I got that backwards.
Toby, where are you, bud?

19:14.398 --> 19:16.432
- Hey. I'm working tonight.
- Oh!

19:16.500 --> 19:18.601
What are you, auditioning
for <i>Magic Mike 2?</i>

19:18.668 --> 19:22.470
- Undercover operation.
- OK, well, here's to your mission.

19:22.538 --> 19:26.808
You know, seeing you all gussied up like
that, I figured you had a date tonight.

19:26.876 --> 19:28.810
- No, no.
- No?

19:28.878 --> 19:31.479
I mean it's been a while
since, uh...

19:31.547 --> 19:33.481
- Tia left, yeah.
- Yeah.

19:33.549 --> 19:35.817
Yes, I, uh, think
about that night often...

19:35.885 --> 19:38.018
the look on her face.

19:38.085 --> 19:40.020
You know, she said
she needed time to think.

19:40.087 --> 19:42.255
- It's been six weeks.
- Six weeks?

19:42.323 --> 19:44.272
And she hasn't called or emailed?
Nothing?

19:44.392 --> 19:45.006
No.

19:45.126 --> 19:47.494
I know I'm not as good as you
at reading signs,

19:47.562 --> 19:49.530
but I think it might be time
to move on, my friend.

19:49.597 --> 19:52.065
- No, I'm not ready to date.
- I'm not talking about dating,

19:52.133 --> 19:54.366
my brother. I'm talking
about a little rebound fling.

19:54.435 --> 19:56.436
It's exactly
what the doctor ordered.

19:56.503 --> 19:58.370
There's this new nurse
in the ER. Her name is Kayla,

19:58.439 --> 20:00.705
which I believe is Gaelic
for "lower back tattoo".

20:00.773 --> 20:02.293
- Let me just get a little...
- What are you doing?

20:02.244 --> 20:03.224
No, no, hey, come on!

20:03.344 --> 20:05.658
There we go. Snap a little picture,
I'm gonna show Kayla.

20:05.778 --> 20:08.480
Kayla. Oh, nice navel ring,
Kayla. No, they're all yours.

20:08.548 --> 20:10.549
Enjoy.
Hey, be safe tonight, bud.

20:10.616 --> 20:12.417
- All right, have a good night.

I'm Christian.

20:27.265 --> 20:28.933
We know who you are.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.968
Then you know I make it a point

20:35.739 --> 20:38.240
What are you ladies
drinking tonight?

20:38.308 --> 20:39.742
Scotch.

20:39.810 --> 20:42.144
What's your best?
The McKinney, of course.

20:42.212 --> 20:44.413
That's the best glass of scotch
money can buy.

20:44.482 --> 20:47.183
We have the 12, 16,
or the 25 year.

20:47.250 --> 20:49.651
There are
better bottles available.

20:49.719 --> 20:52.420
- If there are, I'm not aware.
- The 25 is

20:52.489 --> 20:54.456
the oldest you can buy
off the rack,

20:54.524 --> 20:57.626
but there are much older,
much finer vintages out there.

20:57.694 --> 21:00.462
All held in private collections,
last time I checked.

21:00.530 --> 21:04.465
We might know about six bottles that
have come onto the market recently.

21:04.533 --> 21:06.567
Tell me more.

21:06.635 --> 21:08.836
How's your naval history,
Christian?

21:08.904 --> 21:11.739
- Do I look like a history major?
- But you have heard

21:11.807 --> 21:14.942
of the <i>Andrea Doria?</i>

21:15.010 --> 21:18.345
The '47 is in the open.

Think we're going to let you walk out of
here with $200,000 worth of our property?

21:41.134 --> 21:43.769
I need to appraise the product
before I take it to my employer.

21:43.837 --> 21:45.504
You mean Tarkanian?

21:45.572 --> 21:48.774
I don't use his name
unless it's necessary.

21:48.842 --> 21:50.475
Neither should you.

21:50.544 --> 21:53.411
My apologies. But we still
can't let you walk out of here

21:53.478 --> 21:55.813
with our bottle.
No appraisal, no deal.

21:55.881 --> 21:58.082
You can have 10mL...

21:58.150 --> 22:00.351
more than enough to do
a gas chromatograph analysis.

22:00.419 --> 22:02.319
Allow me.

22:02.387 --> 22:06.624
You know what, actually,
it's better if we do it.

22:06.692 --> 22:09.626
- Do you have something to hide?
- Of course not.

22:11.996 --> 22:13.697
All right.

22:24.074 --> 22:25.808
All done.

22:25.876 --> 22:28.844
I'll be in touch.

22:28.912 --> 22:31.180
Christian,

22:31.247 --> 22:34.283
don't you want a taste?
A taste of what, exactly?

22:34.350 --> 22:36.518
A taste of the '47.

22:36.587 --> 22:38.554
Hm.

22:42.225 --> 22:44.359
Mmm.

22:46.563 --> 22:48.230
How does it taste?

22:48.298 --> 22:49.965
Like the McKinney.

22:50.032 --> 22:54.002
Only the GC analysis can tell
if it's the real thing.

22:54.070 --> 22:56.770
It's the real thing.

23:03.878 --> 23:07.081
That's my number. Call me.

23:07.149 --> 23:08.583
Don't forget.

23:16.457 --> 23:17.991
You did good.

23:22.495 --> 23:24.429
Thanks to the ESN numbers
acquired by our con-artist

23:24.497 --> 23:26.498
friend and a little bit
of my own Kung Fu,

23:26.566 --> 23:28.932
I was able to hack
into Christian's cell phone.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.235
Take a listen.
He left this message earlier.

23:31.303 --> 23:33.304
<i>It's me.</i>
<i>You were right.</i>

23:33.372 --> 23:36.106
<i>It's in the open.</i>
<i>You know how to find me.</i>

23:36.174 --> 23:38.509
- That could be for anyone.
- Well, in my read,

23:38.577 --> 23:40.578
I heard Tarkanian say,
"It's in the open".

23:40.646 --> 23:43.609
This message could be for him.
Can you trace it?

23:43.729 --> 23:45.848
They used what's called
a dead drop server.

23:45.916 --> 23:47.817
It's the preferred
method of communication

23:47.885 --> 23:50.453
of international bad guys
and big-time drug dealers.

23:50.521 --> 23:52.789
- It's totally untraceable.
- So, Tarkanian can

23:52.856 --> 23:55.458
check his messages
anywhere anonymously.

23:55.526 --> 23:58.561
Pretty much, yeah. And I have no way
of tracking him.

23:58.629 --> 24:01.196
It's Christian.

24:01.264 --> 24:03.766
- This is Rochelle.
<I>Meet me tonight-</I>

24:03.833 --> 24:07.169
4025 Gray Avenue.
We'll talk numbers.

24:07.236 --> 24:10.071
- Will your boss be there?
- <I>What difference does it make?</I>

24:10.139 --> 24:12.274
We'll only talk numbers
with him.

24:12.342 --> 24:14.677
You should have
told me this before.

24:14.744 --> 24:17.645
- Well, I'm telling you now.
- <I>Just be there by nine.</I>

24:17.713 --> 24:20.752
I need you to set up
a surveillance team to

24:20.872 --> 24:23.681
4025 Gray Avenue.
I'll set up an arrest team.

24:23.801 --> 24:25.653
- OK, I'll work on a warrant.
- OK, I'm gonna have a chat

24:25.721 --> 24:27.722
- with our friend Bridget.
- OK.

24:27.790 --> 24:30.125
Wanna grab a coffee?

24:30.193 --> 24:32.560
You know someplace good?

24:32.628 --> 24:34.061
I do.

24:34.129 --> 24:36.330
I thought you meant
someplace fun.

24:36.397 --> 24:39.200
Well, this coffee isn't bad,
and it's free.

24:39.267 --> 24:41.168
- Free is good.
- How do you take it?

24:41.236 --> 24:43.503
- Black.
- Black? Perfect.

24:43.571 --> 24:45.172
Me too.

24:51.178 --> 24:53.512
You know, I can
still remember a time

24:53.580 --> 24:56.182
when I didn't know where
my next meal was coming from.

24:56.250 --> 24:59.319
This is you trying
to get me to talk.

24:59.386 --> 25:01.321
Just saying we have
some things in common.

25:01.388 --> 25:04.057
You spent time in group homes,
and so did I.

25:04.124 --> 25:08.257
It was an awful time.
I really don't like talking about it.

25:08.377 --> 25:09.376
Yeah, me neither.

25:09.496 --> 25:12.030
Just saying I get it.

25:12.098 --> 25:14.867
We all have our wounds.

25:21.173 --> 25:24.441
So, what happened to your partner,
uh, James?

25:24.561 --> 25:26.911
Jimmy. Jimmy Foster.

25:27.479 --> 25:30.481
He's in Mount Pleasant
Cemetery now.

25:30.548 --> 25:33.283
Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.

25:33.351 --> 25:34.718
How'd he die?

25:34.786 --> 25:37.653
Aneurysm.
They did all they could.

25:37.721 --> 25:41.624
He was my mentor. Like a father.

25:41.692 --> 25:43.659
Only you can do this.

25:43.727 --> 25:46.763
It's the last one,
and then you're out.

25:49.800 --> 25:52.968
So, was he the one who set up
this score up for you?

25:53.036 --> 25:56.137
He did, as a matter of fact.

25:56.205 --> 25:58.973
He did business with Tarkanian.

25:59.041 --> 26:01.042
He knew he'd pay dearly
for the '47.

26:01.110 --> 26:03.144
- What kind of business?
- I don't know.

26:05.681 --> 26:07.749
He never even let me
meet Tarkanian.

26:07.817 --> 26:09.317
Why not?

26:09.385 --> 26:12.219
He kept me at an arm's length
from certain people.

26:12.287 --> 26:13.954
People he didn't trust.

26:19.861 --> 26:22.930
So, once we get this extra space, I
mean, I'm going to be able to open

26:22.997 --> 26:25.299
- all of this up.
- Wow.

26:25.366 --> 26:27.600
- You know?
- It's beautiful.

26:27.668 --> 26:29.836
I love it, man, I love, yeah.

26:29.904 --> 26:33.005
So, what you gonna do
with that spot over there?

26:33.073 --> 26:35.975
- Uh, second-floor lounge.
- Yeah, about that...

26:36.043 --> 26:38.244
I got a few ideas
about what we could do with it.

26:38.312 --> 26:41.880
- We?
- Well, I am an investor.

26:41.948 --> 26:44.416
I just wanna make a room
where people can hang out,

26:44.484 --> 26:46.552
have some drinks,
do whatever they want.

26:46.619 --> 26:49.420
It can't be anything
that would jeopardize

26:49.488 --> 26:51.923
my licence.
You know that, right?

26:51.990 --> 26:54.325
Look, Adam...

26:54.392 --> 26:56.527
I can make
this whole thing happen.

26:56.595 --> 26:58.563
You're just gonna
have to decide

26:58.630 --> 27:00.431
how badly you want it.

27:00.499 --> 27:03.467
Hmm?

27:03.534 --> 27:05.502
According to the M.E. report,
James Foster died

27:05.570 --> 27:07.471
of multiple gunshot wounds.
The murder was never solved.

27:07.538 --> 27:09.506
She said he died
of an aneurysm.

27:09.574 --> 27:11.441
- Yeah, well, she lied.
- Obviously.

27:11.509 --> 27:14.478
- So, what's she hiding?
- That's the question, isn't it?

27:14.545 --> 27:17.246
Jimmy told her to do
this score from his death bed.

27:17.314 --> 27:20.215
That's interesting, but what does it
have to do with the case we're working?

27:20.283 --> 27:22.384
I don't know, but I'll figure
it out. I love a good mystery.

27:22.452 --> 27:24.419
Yeah, so do I when they look
like her.

27:24.488 --> 27:26.054
Yeah.

27:30.694 --> 27:32.895
How's Toby?

27:32.963 --> 27:35.130
Oh, he's the mayor
of Mopesville.

27:35.198 --> 27:37.932
Still totally hung up on Tia.
Yeah, well, he should be.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.968
I mean, she's the best thing
that ever happened to him.

27:40.035 --> 27:42.036
And I know that she was
crazy about him too.

27:42.104 --> 27:44.506
Thanks, Nicky. Yeah,
but she bailed on him, right?

27:44.573 --> 27:47.441
I mean, she hasn't so much as
responded to an email in six weeks.

27:47.510 --> 27:49.377
Because she's still
figuring it all out. I mean,

27:49.444 --> 27:51.645
if she didn't care about Toby at
all, she'd email him right back.

27:51.713 --> 27:54.414
The fact that she's completely
ignoring Toby is a good thing?

27:54.482 --> 27:57.484
- It means there's still hope.
- I will never understand women.

27:57.552 --> 28:00.020
Just want you to know that.
Thank you.

28:00.087 --> 28:04.024
♪ You showed me life was
more than... ♪

28:04.091 --> 28:07.027
Please come in.

28:07.094 --> 28:09.762
It's just us?

28:09.830 --> 28:13.098
Patience, Rochelle.

28:13.166 --> 28:16.002
If you're angling
for more money...

28:16.069 --> 28:18.170
Oh, my finder's fee is
adequate.

28:18.238 --> 28:21.240
I just thought we'd get to know
each other a bit better.

28:23.776 --> 28:27.612
This is not happening.

28:27.680 --> 28:29.614
You don't have
to cross any lines;

28:29.682 --> 28:31.783
Just dance around them.

28:33.686 --> 28:35.921
I love your home, Christian.

28:35.988 --> 28:38.990
- You have exquisite taste.
- Thank you.

28:39.058 --> 28:42.560
I've always had an eye
for beauty.

28:42.627 --> 28:46.163
And I like what I see tonight.

28:57.140 --> 29:00.242
You are very light
on your feet.

29:00.310 --> 29:02.912
And you, you're not.

29:02.980 --> 29:05.247
Are you tense?
I'm just the kind of girl

29:05.315 --> 29:07.850
who likes to know
what's gonna happen next.

29:07.918 --> 29:10.954
I know what I'd like
to have happen.

29:11.021 --> 29:13.822
Patience, Christian.

29:16.358 --> 29:19.260
You're going to make me wait?

29:19.328 --> 29:22.363
Business first,
and then we can play.

29:25.167 --> 29:27.469
OK. Get your coats.

29:45.853 --> 29:48.254
All right, guys.
We're on the move.

30:08.108 --> 30:10.375
We have to catch up.

30:19.685 --> 30:21.653
If I follow,
he'll know he has a tail.

30:21.720 --> 30:24.221
You're right.
Let's circle the block.

30:34.999 --> 30:39.069
All right, there they are.

30:39.137 --> 30:41.772
Andrei, this is Rochelle

30:41.839 --> 30:44.107
and Sarah.

30:44.175 --> 30:46.176
Christian told me
you have something

30:46.243 --> 30:48.778
that interests me,
if the price is right.

30:48.845 --> 30:50.780
Well, there's no need
to be coy.

30:50.847 --> 30:53.615
Everyone knows that you're
obsessed with the '47.

30:53.684 --> 30:55.885
I've tested the sample.
It's authentic.

30:55.952 --> 30:58.487
- Your price?
- It's worth a million,

30:58.555 --> 31:01.924
so we'll give it to you
for a million and a half.

31:01.992 --> 31:04.458
I should walk right now.

31:04.526 --> 31:06.861
And miss your opportunity of
getting your hands on the '47?

31:06.929 --> 31:09.964
Seven hundred and fifty K.

31:10.032 --> 31:12.300
Nine.

31:12.367 --> 31:13.935
Done.

31:17.406 --> 31:20.007
You've been awfully quiet.

31:20.075 --> 31:23.177
- Problem?
- No.

31:23.244 --> 31:26.546
Hey, don't you want to hear
how we got hold of the '47?

31:26.614 --> 31:28.615
It's one hell of a story.

31:28.683 --> 31:30.818
Another time, perhaps.

31:30.885 --> 31:32.986
But if you try to cross me,

31:33.054 --> 31:35.222
you'll become a story as well.

31:45.597 --> 31:47.132
What's our status?

31:47.199 --> 31:50.068
Waiting for Christian to set
up the meet with Tarkanian.

31:50.136 --> 31:52.736
Everything goes well,
we will get him today.

31:52.804 --> 31:54.905
Today is good, but last night
would have been better.

31:55.223 --> 31:57.157
He gave us the slip.
The guy's a pro.

31:57.225 --> 31:59.092
That guy's been avoiding
capture for over a decade.

31:59.160 --> 32:01.228
Which begs the question,
if he's so cautious,

32:01.296 --> 32:03.530
why expose yourself to capture
only to walk away?

32:03.597 --> 32:05.465
He wanted to sniff us out.

32:05.533 --> 32:07.434
It's his thing.

32:07.501 --> 32:11.137
Sounds like you've done
business with him before.

32:11.204 --> 32:13.472
What's your relationship
with Tarkanian, exactly?

32:13.817 --> 32:16.002
My partner did business
with him.

32:16.122 --> 32:19.355
I wasn't part of the transaction,
I just saw it getting wrapped up.

32:19.475 --> 32:20.913
So, hold on.
During this transaction

32:20.981 --> 32:23.316
with your partner,
did he see you?

32:23.383 --> 32:25.883
<i>Let me try this.</i>

32:28.120 --> 32:29.821
For a second, at most.

32:29.888 --> 32:32.223
It's impossible
he would remember me.

32:34.193 --> 32:37.162
That's my phone.

32:38.298 --> 32:39.596
Got it.

32:39.716 --> 32:40.897
It's Christian.

32:40.966 --> 32:42.399
This is Rochelle.

32:42.467 --> 32:44.835
Bryer's Pier. Half-an-hour.

32:44.902 --> 32:48.272
- <I>Bring the product.</I>
- We'll be there. We have to move now.

32:48.340 --> 32:51.942
- Can I speak to you guys for a minute?
- Yeah.

32:58.148 --> 33:00.549
There's a problem
with my reads of Bridget.

33:00.617 --> 33:02.986
All right, I've seen
the same event

33:03.053 --> 33:04.988
with two different outcomes.

33:05.055 --> 33:07.457
- I'm not sure I follow.
- When she first mentioned

33:07.524 --> 33:10.226
Tarkanian, I read her
and she was nowhere near him.

33:10.294 --> 33:14.730
Just now I heard her think,
"Let me try this",

33:14.798 --> 33:18.400
and then I saw a different version of the
same event, where she was right beside him.

33:18.468 --> 33:21.670
Also, she said that her partner
Jimmy died of an aneurysm

33:21.738 --> 33:23.806
when he was
actually shot to death.

33:23.874 --> 33:28.210
- OK, so, what, you're reading her lies?
- Yeah, it feels like that.

33:28.277 --> 33:31.178
- I thought you could only read the truth.
- I've encountered

33:31.246 --> 33:33.681
a lot of unusual minds,
but, uh, this is a new one.

33:33.749 --> 33:35.316
I read an article once

33:35.384 --> 33:37.451
about MRI tests
on pathological liars.

33:37.519 --> 33:39.720
Apparently they actually see
the lies they tell.

33:39.787 --> 33:42.756
- Yeah, it feels like that.
- Toby Logan, meet your Kryptonite.

33:42.824 --> 33:45.059
I think we should reassess
this meet. I don't like

33:45.127 --> 33:46.888
- what you're walking into.
- It's fine, I'll be fine.

33:47.008 --> 33:47.915
Michelle, I just...

33:48.035 --> 33:50.181
This could be our only
shot to get to Tarkanian.

33:50.301 --> 33:53.033
- Michelle, let's go, it's time.
- Yeah.

33:53.100 --> 33:55.435
All right, go. But for God's
sakes, be careful. You stay

33:55.503 --> 33:57.970
behind and you sweat Bridget.
Figure out what she's up to.

33:58.039 --> 34:01.074
All right,
I'll bring my A game.

34:29.068 --> 34:31.902
I didn't know
you liked it rough.

34:31.969 --> 34:33.938
This is not a game, Bridget.

34:35.907 --> 34:37.675
I thought we were good.

34:37.742 --> 34:39.708
I thought we had a connection.

34:39.777 --> 34:42.011
You've been playing some kind
of angle this whole time.

34:42.080 --> 34:43.746
I need to know what it is.

34:43.813 --> 34:47.016
You really think I have
some kind of secret agenda?

34:47.085 --> 34:50.053
<i>You all played your parts.</i>

34:50.121 --> 34:53.422
I do. And somehow
we all fit into it.

34:53.491 --> 34:55.458
You took advantage of us;

34:55.525 --> 34:58.194
you made the IIB work for you.

34:58.261 --> 35:00.429
Or is this all a part
of your plan?

35:00.497 --> 35:04.505
To get arrested?
You think I like this?

35:04.625 --> 35:07.570
What really happened between
Tarkanian and Jimmy?

35:07.637 --> 35:09.605
I don't know.

35:09.672 --> 35:12.840
He wanted you to do this score
on his deathbed. Why?

35:12.908 --> 35:14.409
That's between me and him.

35:18.147 --> 35:20.047
Jimmy didn't die
of an aneurysm.

35:20.116 --> 35:22.517
You lied to me. That's why
we don't have a connection.

35:22.585 --> 35:24.719
I'm not gonna talk about Jimmy.

35:24.786 --> 35:27.121
You don't have to.

35:31.926 --> 35:34.361
You're the only one
who can do it.

35:34.429 --> 35:39.284
- The last score, then you're out.
- Daddy.

35:42.270 --> 35:44.237
He wasn't your mentor.

35:44.304 --> 35:46.372
He wasn't your partner.

35:46.440 --> 35:48.341
He was your father.

35:48.408 --> 35:51.377
So, what happened?

35:51.445 --> 35:54.847
He came back after your mother died?
Took you under his wing?

35:54.914 --> 35:57.350
So, you got me all figured out.

35:57.417 --> 35:59.018
Satisfied?

35:59.085 --> 36:00.752
You were there when he died.

36:02.035 --> 36:04.839
You want revenge on Tarkanian.

36:06.792 --> 36:09.794
So, what's the next move,
Bridget?

36:13.466 --> 36:17.501
Tell Tarkanian I can make a
better deal, just him and me alone.

36:19.671 --> 36:22.173
Got it.

36:30.782 --> 36:33.082
She's been in contact
with Tarkanian behind our backs.

36:33.150 --> 36:35.685
We need to get Michelle
out of there.

37:05.714 --> 37:07.682
Where's your partner?

37:07.749 --> 37:10.951
With the product,
waiting for my signal.

37:11.019 --> 37:13.187
- Mm.
- Where's Tarkanian?

37:15.591 --> 37:17.758
He sends his regrets.

37:23.731 --> 37:26.266
Michelle. Are you good?

37:26.334 --> 37:29.001
- You OK?
- Yeah, I will be,

37:29.069 --> 37:31.538
once someone tells me
what the hell is going on.

37:39.320 --> 37:42.288
- Hey.
- Hey. Bridget escaped.

37:42.356 --> 37:45.123
- IIB's under lockdown.
- What's her endgame?

37:45.191 --> 37:46.789
Revenge. Tarkanian killed
Jimmy Foster,

37:46.909 --> 37:48.954
who was her father, by the way.

37:49.074 --> 37:52.864
I spoke with the evidence locker guards
at IIB. No sign of Bridget,

37:52.932 --> 37:54.892
- but the McKinney is still there.
- OK, let's double up on security.

37:55.012 --> 37:57.159
- Let's talk to Christian.
- Yeah.

37:58.251 --> 38:01.772
Save your breath. My lawyer
will be here any second.

38:01.840 --> 38:03.941
Well, I hope you have
a good one, because a pretty man

38:04.009 --> 38:07.445
like yourself is gonna make
a lot of friends in jail.

38:07.512 --> 38:09.580
Why did Tarkanian send you
to kill me?

38:09.647 --> 38:11.615
He wanted you dealt with.

38:11.683 --> 38:13.717
You and your so-called partner.

38:13.785 --> 38:17.120
She thinks she could pull one
over on Tarkanian, but...

38:17.188 --> 38:18.821
she can't fool him.

38:18.889 --> 38:20.556
What did he find out?

38:20.624 --> 38:23.793
You think I'm going
to tell you?

38:23.861 --> 38:26.529
- How could you miss that?
- I checked her record myself.

38:26.597 --> 38:28.764
It was fixed!
I'll fix it myself!

38:28.832 --> 38:31.968
Tarkanian wants to kill her.
How's he gonna do it?

38:34.237 --> 38:36.405
He said he'll meet with you
today, at the club.

38:36.473 --> 38:38.540
We gotta get to the Montgomery.

38:45.148 --> 38:48.517
So, you decided
to cut out your partner.

38:48.584 --> 38:51.219
Just looking out
for number one.

38:53.266 --> 38:56.820
I know a little bit
about looking after number one.

39:00.562 --> 39:02.430
So, this was about getting

39:02.498 --> 39:05.198
- to Tarkanian.
- Mmhmm. She played us perfectly.

39:05.266 --> 39:07.467
She needed our help,
so she got herself caught.

39:07.535 --> 39:09.636
Think of all the bread crumbs...
Mickey, the rental car...

39:09.703 --> 39:11.771
Why would she want
to get caught?

39:11.839 --> 39:15.242
We helped her get past Christian.
We gave her a new identity,

39:15.309 --> 39:17.244
we fixed her records,
we helped her pass Christian's

39:17.311 --> 39:19.513
- security checks.
- And what about Tarkanian?

39:19.580 --> 39:22.181
Like Christian said,
you can't fool The Shark.

39:22.249 --> 39:24.616
Somehow he found out
we fixed her records.

39:24.684 --> 39:27.319
So, she's walking into a trap.

39:27.387 --> 39:29.422
I have a car waiting.

39:29.489 --> 39:34.026
I get into a car with you,
and I'm never coming back.

39:34.094 --> 39:37.029
Just like Jimmy.

39:37.096 --> 39:39.830
Open that case, right now.

39:43.369 --> 39:46.137
Ah!

39:46.205 --> 39:47.705
Please.

39:47.773 --> 39:50.608
I'll give you
whatever you want.

39:50.676 --> 39:53.843
You've already taken the only
thing that mattered to me.

39:53.911 --> 39:58.014
Please. Relax.
Put your gun down.

40:11.528 --> 40:13.829
< i>How's
<i>the bodyguard?</i>

40:13.897 --> 40:16.599
He was rushed to St. Mike's.
Concussion, powder burns,

40:16.666 --> 40:19.702
but he's gonna be all right.
The proverbial smoking gun.

40:19.769 --> 40:22.871
She left us with a living witness
and a gun with her prints on it.

40:22.939 --> 40:25.373
She wants us to know
she did it.

40:25.441 --> 40:27.442
Hey. I have coordinated
with Metro, they've got

40:27.510 --> 40:29.552
- every available unit looking.
- Border Services?

40:29.672 --> 40:31.215
Every airport and checkpoint
has her photo.

40:31.335 --> 40:33.329
She's not gonna get very far.
She's been red-flagged.

40:33.449 --> 40:36.218
Come on, this is Bridget
we're talking about.

40:36.285 --> 40:38.786
We're never gonna
see her again.

40:43.191 --> 40:45.159
You look happy.

40:45.227 --> 40:48.129
Because I just received a call
of kudos from the upper brass,

40:48.196 --> 40:50.363
seeing how I just closed
the case on Tarkanian.

40:50.431 --> 40:53.433
YOU closed the case
on Tarkanian?

40:53.501 --> 40:56.603
I gave credit
to the whole team, of course.

40:56.671 --> 40:58.304
Of course.

Call Tia. Tell her that she can
take as much time as she needs,

42:39.134 --> 42:41.968
and when she's ready to come
back, you'll be there for her.

42:42.036 --> 42:43.591
K, I thought I'm supposed
to move on.

42:43.711 --> 42:48.375
No, no no. See, you don't move on
from a girl like Tia. You dig in

42:48.443 --> 42:52.512
