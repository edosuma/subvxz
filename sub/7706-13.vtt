WEBVTT

00:03.938 --> 00:05.270
[clearing throat]

00:05.272 --> 00:06.605
It's a movie.

00:07.775 --> 00:09.108
Two words.

00:11.545 --> 00:12.745
"The Jerk."

00:16.884 --> 00:18.350
- "The Birds."
- Aah!

00:18.352 --> 00:21.286
- You got it, Bri!
- No fair!

00:21.288 --> 00:23.055
You were giving him
hand signals

00:23.057 --> 00:25.357
to help him guess.

00:25.359 --> 00:28.160
ALF, that's how
you play charades.

00:28.162 --> 00:31.363
Oh. Well, let me try,
let me try.

00:32.066 --> 00:33.465
Alright, uh..

00:35.069 --> 00:36.835
- It's a movie.
- Mm-hm.

00:36.837 --> 00:38.337
Uh.

00:38.339 --> 00:40.406
Uh, y-you, it's about you.

00:40.408 --> 00:42.908
"The Brother
From Another Planet?"

00:42.910 --> 00:45.377
- "Hair."
- No, no.

00:45.379 --> 00:47.679
You're all wrong.

00:47.681 --> 00:51.083
It's, "The Man
Who Would Be King."

00:51.085 --> 00:53.085
- Oh, please!
- Oh, ALF.

00:53.087 --> 00:55.854
I know,
you're kicking yourselves

00:55.856 --> 00:58.157
because it's so obvious.

00:59.760 --> 01:02.761
[theme music]

01:32.793 --> 01:35.794
[music continues]

02:02.156 --> 02:03.822
[instrumental music]

02:05.960 --> 02:07.326
[doorbell rings]

02:07.328 --> 02:08.927
ALF, hide in the kitchen.

02:08.929 --> 02:11.797
You know, if you weren't always
sending me to the kitchen

02:11.799 --> 02:14.333
I might not eat so much.

02:14.335 --> 02:16.735
ALF, please, please.

02:16.737 --> 02:20.472
No wonder Willie's pants
don't fit me anymore.

02:25.513 --> 02:28.113
- Hi, Willie. Hi, Kate.
- Hi, guys.

02:28.115 --> 02:30.082
And other residents
of the Tanner manor.

02:30.084 --> 02:32.351
Hi, Trevor, Raquel.

02:32.353 --> 02:34.319
And who might this be?

02:34.321 --> 02:37.856
Uh, this is Jake,
my brother Cyril's kid.

02:37.858 --> 02:40.192
These are the Tanners.

02:40.194 --> 02:41.627
- How do you do?
- Well, hi, Jake.

02:41.629 --> 02:44.029
- Hi.
- Hi, Jake.

02:44.031 --> 02:45.531
Yeah.

02:45.533 --> 02:47.666
Uh, Jake just flew in
from New York.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.801
He'll be staying with us
while his father's away.

02:49.803 --> 02:53.672
- Oh, how long will that be?
- Five years.

02:53.674 --> 02:56.441
Unless he gets time off
for good behavior.

02:58.546 --> 03:00.145
Oh, uh, everybody sit down.

03:00.147 --> 03:02.214
Uh, let me go get
some ice tea.

03:02.216 --> 03:04.216
Oh, please, let me help.

03:04.218 --> 03:06.618
After all, I am a mother now.

03:06.620 --> 03:09.354
That's okay.
I think, I can handle it.

03:09.356 --> 03:11.623
Fine! Hog the limelight.

03:13.227 --> 03:14.927
A-alright, Raquel.

03:16.297 --> 03:18.897
Oh! Uh, give me just a minute.

03:18.899 --> 03:19.998
There's uh..

03:20.000 --> 03:22.534
...a big bug in there
I don't want you to see.

03:22.536 --> 03:23.569
Hmm.

03:25.673 --> 03:28.373
ALF, ALF, you've got to
get out of here.

03:28.375 --> 03:29.975
I know, I know.

03:29.977 --> 03:32.411
There's a big bug in here.

03:32.413 --> 03:35.647
There's no bug.
I just said that to fool Raquel.

03:35.649 --> 03:38.083
You expect her
to fall for that?

03:38.085 --> 03:41.320
- You did.
- Well, I'm naive.

03:41.322 --> 03:44.056
Please, ALF,
you'll have to leave.

03:44.058 --> 03:46.592
I just got here.

03:46.594 --> 03:49.061
Isn't that a rattlesnake
under the sink?

03:49.063 --> 03:50.262
[gasps]

03:50.264 --> 03:51.663
I'm gone.

03:56.604 --> 03:59.204
You can come in, Raquel.

03:59.206 --> 04:01.607
[coughing]

04:01.609 --> 04:03.809
Oh, that bug never
stood a chance.

04:06.580 --> 04:09.214
What do you think of Jake?

04:09.216 --> 04:10.549
Well, I just met him.

04:10.551 --> 04:12.918
He seems, um..

04:12.920 --> 04:14.086
...quiet.

04:14.088 --> 04:15.454
Well, Brian doesn't say much

04:15.456 --> 04:18.357
and you don't see me
making a stink.

04:19.126 --> 04:20.692
Raquel.

04:20.694 --> 04:24.129
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm just so excited.

04:24.131 --> 04:26.465
I have<i> always</i> wanted a child

04:26.467 --> 04:28.233
but Trevor wanted
to go for his masters

04:28.235 --> 04:30.435
in art history.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.404
Now, that I have a child

04:32.406 --> 04:34.806
I'm just nervous,
I'm so nervous.

04:34.808 --> 04:38.777
Oh, well, don't you worry.
Children can be difficult.

04:38.779 --> 04:43.215
But at least
they don't shed in the milk.

04:43.217 --> 04:47.653
My, I haven't heard
that old cliche in years.

04:47.655 --> 04:51.623
Well, if you need any advice,
Raquel, I'm right here.

04:52.593 --> 04:55.127
Well, I do have a few questions.

04:59.266 --> 05:03.335
"Is Jake old enough to date?
Should he get an allowance?"

05:03.337 --> 05:05.937
"When do I send him to bed?"

05:05.939 --> 05:07.472
Well, Brian
is a little bit younger

05:07.474 --> 05:08.974
but I send him to bed at 8:00.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.642
So you think.

05:10.644 --> 05:13.078
His light stays on till 8:30.

05:13.080 --> 05:17.149
And Lynn's doesn't go off until
11:00 or even later.

05:19.186 --> 05:20.886
So I've heard.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.357
So, Jake,
I guess we'll be going

05:25.359 --> 05:26.858
to the same school.

05:26.860 --> 05:28.060
Till I drop out.

05:29.129 --> 05:30.696
You're dropping out?

05:30.698 --> 05:34.833
When I'm sixteen, in one year,
three months and eighteen days.

05:34.835 --> 05:37.002
Aah, geez.

05:37.004 --> 05:39.037
Boy, you're lucky.

05:39.039 --> 05:42.874
I've got eight years
two months and four days.

05:42.876 --> 05:45.377
Oh, is Jake helping Brian
with his math?

05:45.379 --> 05:47.346
Not exactly.

05:47.348 --> 05:49.614
Willie, can we talk in private?

05:49.616 --> 05:51.883
Sure, we can go
in to the laundry room?

05:51.885 --> 05:54.219
No! Uh..

05:54.221 --> 05:56.722
There's laundry in there.

05:56.724 --> 05:58.890
Well, the bedroom, then no one
can hear us in there.

05:58.892 --> 06:00.459
Raquel can.

06:08.369 --> 06:11.370
Alright.
Hold still, Lucky.

06:11.372 --> 06:13.805
I'll be off your back
in a minute.

06:14.808 --> 06:16.875
[Lucky yowls]
Whoa!

06:19.313 --> 06:20.812
[grunts]

06:20.814 --> 06:24.983
The only good cat
is a stir-fried cat.

06:24.985 --> 06:26.084
[grunts]

06:27.421 --> 06:30.322
(Trevor)
'Ow! Right in the navel.'

06:30.324 --> 06:31.723
I-I'm sorry, Trevor.

06:31.725 --> 06:35.026
You-you can't come in
just at the moment.

06:35.028 --> 06:38.497
- ALF, hide. Get out.
- I'm not even in yet.

06:38.499 --> 06:40.098
Trevor's waiting right outside.

06:40.100 --> 06:44.169
First, promise me you'll build
me a room of my own.

06:44.171 --> 06:45.904
Hide now..

06:45.906 --> 06:47.139
...or else..

06:48.442 --> 06:51.176
Wasn't that
a Chuck Norris film?

06:53.547 --> 06:54.780
"Gangway."

06:54.782 --> 06:57.549
[Lucky yowls]
Oh!

06:57.551 --> 06:59.751
[Lucky yowling]

07:04.792 --> 07:07.025
Why'd you slam
the door on me?

07:07.027 --> 07:09.961
- Well, I, uh--
- Now, don't tell me.

07:09.963 --> 07:12.631
Someone didn't make
his bed this morning?

07:12.633 --> 07:15.267
Caught in the act.

07:15.269 --> 07:17.769
Uh, Trevor,
what did you, uh

07:17.771 --> 07:20.572
what did you want
to talk about?

07:20.574 --> 07:22.474
Jake.

07:22.476 --> 07:24.643
I don't know,
what I'm gonna do with that kid.

07:24.645 --> 07:27.479
H-he talks back, he disobeys.

07:27.481 --> 07:29.314
And I think he stole
a bag of peat moss

07:29.316 --> 07:31.483
from our living room.

07:31.485 --> 07:34.319
Why would you have
a bag of peat moss

07:34.321 --> 07:36.388
in your living room?

07:36.390 --> 07:38.723
To keep people
from stealing it.

07:38.725 --> 07:40.158
Well, obviously.

07:43.230 --> 07:44.596
Uh, don't you think

07:44.598 --> 07:47.098
you should have
a talk with Jake?

07:47.100 --> 07:50.502
Look, Willie,
I gotta be honest.

07:50.504 --> 07:52.771
I'm no good with kids.

07:52.773 --> 07:54.906
All I ever raised was tomatoes.

07:54.908 --> 07:57.576
And without my peat moss,
I can't even do that.

07:59.012 --> 08:02.080
Well, do you want me
to try to talk to him?

08:03.250 --> 08:04.983
Would you?

08:04.985 --> 08:07.152
Maybe you can get
a handle on him.

08:07.154 --> 08:08.787
He's a smart kid.

08:08.789 --> 08:10.589
After all, he's an Ochmonek.

08:11.358 --> 08:12.991
Say no more.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.927
I just want Jake
to turn out okay.

08:15.929 --> 08:17.195
He will.

08:17.197 --> 08:19.798
I'm sure, he will
as long as he gets the love

08:19.800 --> 08:23.201
and the guidance
that he needs.

08:23.203 --> 08:25.537
Aw, that's pretty.

08:25.539 --> 08:28.640
I, I just don't want Jake
to wind up in jail

08:28.642 --> 08:29.975
like his father.

08:29.977 --> 08:33.044
Or his brother.
Or his cousin Victor.

08:38.952 --> 08:41.720
So, Jake, I see,
you've made a little friend.

08:41.722 --> 08:44.756
Little friend?
She's a beanpole.

08:45.826 --> 08:48.360
You should see me
in heels, shrimpo.

08:50.330 --> 08:53.331
- Well, you guys having fun?
- Are you kiddin'?

08:53.333 --> 08:56.134
Your daughter's gonna put on
heels for me in a minute.

08:58.238 --> 09:00.405
Uh, Trevor, I think
we should be going now.

09:00.407 --> 09:04.075
Yeah, we've about exhausted
the idle chit chat.

09:04.077 --> 09:05.977
Well, Jake, uh,
why don't you come back

09:05.979 --> 09:07.712
over tonight after supper.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.180
You can have
some cake with us.

09:09.182 --> 09:11.883
Just have Stretch
bring it over.

09:11.885 --> 09:14.085
You wanna pop
out of it for me?

09:14.087 --> 09:17.055
You wanna live long enough
to drop out of school?

09:18.225 --> 09:21.026
- Let's go.
- Yes, goodbye, everybody.

09:21.028 --> 09:23.094
- So long, Jake.
- Sure, peewee.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.697
Who you calling peewee?

09:25.699 --> 09:28.600
- You.
- Just asking.

09:28.602 --> 09:30.001
Come on.

09:30.837 --> 09:32.337
See you, Willie.

09:34.274 --> 09:36.341
Brian.

09:36.343 --> 09:38.009
Don't ever change.

09:39.279 --> 09:42.747
Well, that Jake really
grows on you, doesn't he?

09:42.749 --> 09:44.616
Not on me.

09:44.618 --> 09:47.118
Don't you think
he's a little rude?

09:47.120 --> 09:48.286
[burps]

09:48.288 --> 09:50.388

09:59.132 --> 10:01.633
Cake! Cake! Cake!

10:01.635 --> 10:04.703
- Cake!
- We're saving it for Jake.

10:06.073 --> 10:07.205
Okay.

10:10.410 --> 10:12.477
He's not coming.
Let's eat.

10:12.479 --> 10:13.979
He'll be here, ALF.

10:13.981 --> 10:16.281
- He'll be here.
- Are you kidding?

10:16.283 --> 10:20.485
The kid's probably going up
the river as we speak.

10:21.655 --> 10:23.922
They'll put him in solitary.

10:23.924 --> 10:26.758
Feed him bread and water.

10:26.760 --> 10:30.228
Topped by a delicious
piece of chocolate..

10:31.598 --> 10:33.098

10:33.100 --> 10:36.167
Look, Jake may have
some problems

10:36.169 --> 10:39.170
but he's not going to be
sent to prison.

10:39.172 --> 10:41.673
Yeah? Tell that to my cousin.

10:41.675 --> 10:43.842
Pretty boy Shumway.

10:43.844 --> 10:46.811
He grew up on
the south side of Melmac.

10:46.813 --> 10:49.080
The baddest part of the planet.

10:49.082 --> 10:51.349
If he didn't like your shoes..

10:51.351 --> 10:52.917
[imitating gunfire]

10:53.820 --> 10:55.153
You mean, he'd shoot a person

10:55.155 --> 10:56.855
just because
he didn't like his shoes?

10:56.857 --> 10:59.357
No, he'd just point
at them and go

10:59.359 --> 11:01.760
eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh.

11:03.664 --> 11:07.365
Mr. Ochmonek just called,
he said Jake won't come over.

11:07.367 --> 11:09.367
Well, I didn't hear the phone.

11:09.369 --> 11:12.270
Oh, oh, he just hollered
through my window.

11:12.973 --> 11:15.340
Alright! Let's eat.

11:16.109 --> 11:17.909
Would you like some cake?

11:18.712 --> 11:21.046

12:29.783 --> 12:31.616
[laughs]

12:31.618 --> 12:33.585
Oh, I kill me!

12:33.587 --> 12:36.788
(Scotty)
'Oh, hi, Alf.
Good to hear you, lad!'

12:36.790 --> 12:38.623
How'd you know it was me?

12:38.625 --> 12:42.193
(Scotty)
'Because you always start
with the same corny joke.'

12:42.195 --> 12:44.729
'Listen, I've just learned
a new Madonna song.

12:44.731 --> 12:46.131
'"Papa don't Preach!"'

12:46.133 --> 12:49.334
[off-key bagpipe music]

12:51.304 --> 12:53.905
Um, uh, Scotty,
uh, let me adjust

12:53.907 --> 12:56.307
the volume
just a little bit, okay?

12:56.309 --> 13:00.745
If I lose you, we'll talk
in a few days! Okay, bye!

13:00.747 --> 13:01.980
Ha!

13:01.982 --> 13:03.982
Well, I'm hungry.

13:03.984 --> 13:05.884
Maybe I'll call Turkey.

13:08.555 --> 13:09.821
Hey!

13:09.823 --> 13:11.623
[stuttering]
You...stay!

13:11.625 --> 13:13.825
Drop that telescope!

13:13.827 --> 13:15.226
[clangs]

13:15.228 --> 13:17.962
On second thought...don't.

13:21.101 --> 13:23.968
Get away from me.
Just<i> stay</i> away from me.

13:23.970 --> 13:26.004
Wait! You can't leave.

13:26.006 --> 13:28.506
They'll think
I broke the telescope.

13:28.508 --> 13:31.176
Okay. Okay, I'll fix it.

13:31.178 --> 13:33.344
Just don't bite me.

13:33.346 --> 13:34.679
Bite ya?

13:34.681 --> 13:36.080
That's a good idea.

13:36.082 --> 13:39.050
I'll bite you
if you don't fix this.

13:39.853 --> 13:41.452
Al-alright!

13:41.454 --> 13:44.622
Just don't tell my aunt
and uncle I was takin' it.

13:44.624 --> 13:46.090
On one condition.

13:46.092 --> 13:47.959
You fix this telescope

13:47.961 --> 13:51.029
and you don't tell
anyone about<i> me.</i>

13:51.031 --> 13:52.797
That's two conditions.

13:52.799 --> 13:54.032
[snarling]

13:54.034 --> 13:57.468
Alright!
You've-you've got a deal.

13:57.470 --> 13:59.103
What are ya, anyway?

13:59.105 --> 14:02.340
I'm an alien.
From the planet Melmac.

14:02.342 --> 14:06.444
I have powers
you can only dream of.

14:06.446 --> 14:07.579
Like what?

14:08.815 --> 14:11.149
I could watch ten hours of TV

14:11.151 --> 14:15.286
without ever getting up
to go to the bathroom.

14:15.288 --> 14:18.389
You are the weirdest thing
I've ever seen.

14:18.391 --> 14:21.326
You ought to see me
with my hair wet.

14:21.328 --> 14:24.062
Do the Tanners know about ya?

14:24.064 --> 14:27.298
Yeah, they know all about me.

14:27.300 --> 14:28.466
Well..

14:28.468 --> 14:31.369
They don't know
that I've had liposuction.

14:34.241 --> 14:36.741
Where'd you learn how to fix
telescopes like that?

14:36.743 --> 14:38.509
Caltech?

14:38.511 --> 14:40.678
No, m-my dad taught me.

14:40.680 --> 14:42.580
We used to find
things in the trash

14:42.582 --> 14:44.382
and then fix 'em.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.751
My dad could fix anything.

14:46.753 --> 14:48.753
Especially horse races.

14:50.090 --> 14:51.723
Wild guess.

14:51.725 --> 14:53.391
That's why he's in jail?

14:53.393 --> 14:54.759
[sighs]

14:54.761 --> 14:56.761
Yeah.

14:56.763 --> 14:59.163
Well, uh.. I'm done.

14:59.165 --> 15:02.000
Wow! Well, you're good!

15:02.002 --> 15:03.668
And fast!

15:03.670 --> 15:06.104
Uh, it's no big deal.

15:06.106 --> 15:07.839
No big deal?

15:07.841 --> 15:10.708
On Melmac we only had one guy

15:10.710 --> 15:12.577
who knew how to fix things.

15:12.579 --> 15:15.380
They put him
on display in a zoo.

15:15.382 --> 15:17.849
But the door
to the cage was broken

15:17.851 --> 15:19.350
so he walked away.

15:20.453 --> 15:22.420
Uh, good story.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.355
- Is it okay if I go now?
- Yeah.

15:24.357 --> 15:26.357
Yeah, but remember our deal!

15:26.359 --> 15:29.460
You can't tell anyone about me.

15:29.462 --> 15:33.031
Hey, don't worry.
I live by the Ochmonek code.

15:33.033 --> 15:34.632
We don't squeal..

15:34.634 --> 15:35.700
...or tip.

15:36.970 --> 15:38.369
Name's ALF.

15:39.973 --> 15:41.306
J-Jake.

15:42.776 --> 15:44.475
- Bye.
- Bye.

15:53.553 --> 15:55.386
[snarling]

15:58.458 --> 16:00.158
I still got it.

16:00.160 --> 16:03.394
[instrumental music]

16:06.166 --> 16:08.666
And Magic runs down!

16:08.668 --> 16:10.168
Oh, man!

16:10.170 --> 16:12.236
Takes one!

16:12.238 --> 16:14.739
And a three, two, one!

16:15.909 --> 16:17.642
Jake, what are you doing?

16:17.644 --> 16:19.777
That's my Aunt Ruth!

16:19.779 --> 16:23.514
Don't worry, I poured her
into the Dixie cup over there.

16:23.516 --> 16:25.083
[laughs]

16:31.524 --> 16:35.660
Uh, Auntie Raquel,
you should get to the bedroom.

16:35.662 --> 16:39.297
I heard Uncle Trevor singing
"That's<i> Amore."</i>

16:39.299 --> 16:41.032
That's strange.

16:41.034 --> 16:43.835
He usually
just sets the egg timer.

16:43.837 --> 16:46.704
Trevor! Trevor, wait for me!

16:53.646 --> 16:55.179
What are you doin' here?

16:55.181 --> 16:57.949
I brought over few things
for you to fix.

16:57.951 --> 17:00.318
Here's a tape recorder.
It's got fur stuck in it.

17:00.320 --> 17:01.786
I don't know
how that happened.

17:05.225 --> 17:07.225
What happened to this?

17:07.227 --> 17:09.594
I tried to puree a rock.

17:10.964 --> 17:12.463
It didn't work.

17:13.633 --> 17:14.565
(Raquel)
'Jake?'

17:14.567 --> 17:16.734
'Are you talking to someone?'

17:16.736 --> 17:18.636
No, it's just the TV!

17:18.638 --> 17:22.573
Uh, uh, Welcome
to "Monday Night Football!"

17:22.575 --> 17:23.541
ALF! It's Saturday!

17:23.543 --> 17:25.576
Uh, uh.. Live from New York!

17:25.578 --> 17:28.813
- It's "Saturday--"
- Uh, I'm shuttin' it off!

17:28.815 --> 17:30.148
Click!

17:31.251 --> 17:33.818
So, uh..
Can you fix all this stuff?

17:33.820 --> 17:38.322
Hey, my motto is if
I can't fix it, it ain't broken.

17:38.324 --> 17:39.624
My motto is..

17:40.260 --> 17:41.659
...I broke it.

17:43.029 --> 17:46.097
My dad's motto is
"I broke into it."

17:46.099 --> 17:48.433
Ha! Ha! Hey, hey!

17:48.435 --> 17:52.036
You're pretty funny
for a delinquent.

17:52.038 --> 17:55.540
Ah! I love this male bonding.

17:55.542 --> 17:59.343
What do you say we go out back
and throw a cat on the Barbie?

18:01.915 --> 18:03.448
Just a thought.

18:04.784 --> 18:07.819
[instrumental music]

18:10.590 --> 18:12.356
Dad?

18:12.358 --> 18:13.558
Do you think
these boots would look good

18:13.560 --> 18:14.859
with my blue jump suit?

18:14.861 --> 18:17.061
Oh, yes. Yes, indeed.

18:17.063 --> 18:19.630
I was planning to wear
that jumpsuit on my birthday.

18:21.067 --> 18:23.768
Is it that time of year already?

18:25.038 --> 18:26.971
¶ Lynn wants boots
for her birthday ¶

18:26.973 --> 18:28.873
¶ Lynn wants boots
for her birthday! ¶¶

18:28.875 --> 18:33.611
Alf, I was trying
to be discreet.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.146
Oh.

18:35.148 --> 18:38.983
Say, Willie, wouldn't a pizza
look good on my tongue

18:38.985 --> 18:40.651
right about now?

18:40.653 --> 18:42.120
[knock on door]

18:42.122 --> 18:45.923
- Go!
- You can't tell me what to do.

18:45.925 --> 18:47.992
Order your pizza.

18:47.994 --> 18:49.827
Yes, sir!

18:49.829 --> 18:53.464
(Trevor)
'Hey, Tanner, let me in,
would you? I-I lost my key!'

18:53.466 --> 18:56.000
- I'll get it!
- He has a key?

18:58.271 --> 18:59.604
- Hi, Lynn.
- Hi.

18:59.606 --> 19:02.006
Willie, is this
your tape recorder?

19:02.008 --> 19:03.741
Well, gee, I'm not sure.

19:05.745 --> 19:08.312
(Alf on tape recorder)
'I'm tellin' you,
my sister's so fat'

19:08.314 --> 19:11.282
'she gets her legs waxed
at the car wash!'

19:11.284 --> 19:13.317
'Ha! Ha!'

19:13.319 --> 19:16.320
- He-he-he.
- Yes, uh, that's ours.

19:16.322 --> 19:17.855
Who's the comedian?

19:17.857 --> 19:19.290
You ever heard of..

19:19.292 --> 19:21.025
...Jay Leno?

19:21.027 --> 19:22.026
No.

19:22.028 --> 19:23.594
It's Jay Leno.

19:26.366 --> 19:28.132
I found this in Jake's room.

19:28.134 --> 19:29.534
I told you the kid
was a crook.

19:29.536 --> 19:32.703
- I was<i> fixin'</i> it!
- He's a liar, too.

19:32.705 --> 19:35.273
Your father
would be so ashamed.

19:35.275 --> 19:37.875
It's a good thing
he's in jail.

19:37.877 --> 19:39.277
Psst. Psst.

19:39.279 --> 19:42.280
Jake, uh,
I don't know what to say.

19:42.282 --> 19:43.648
- Pssst!
- W-w..

19:43.650 --> 19:45.716
W-whatever made
you do such a thing?

19:48.655 --> 19:49.987
[groans]

19:49.989 --> 19:51.322
Could..

19:51.324 --> 19:54.025
Could you excuse me,
just for a moment?

19:57.997 --> 20:00.464
Hey! I invented a new sport.

20:00.466 --> 20:02.366
Biscuit ball.

20:03.970 --> 20:05.570
What do you want?

20:05.572 --> 20:07.038
You're wrong about Jake.

20:07.840 --> 20:08.973
He's a good kid.

20:10.343 --> 20:12.143
He stole our tape recorder.

20:12.145 --> 20:14.011
He was fixing it.

20:14.013 --> 20:15.746
He can fix anything.

20:15.748 --> 20:18.482
How do you know
so much about Jake?

20:18.484 --> 20:19.817
Has he seen you?

20:21.221 --> 20:22.653
- Yeah.
- Oh.

20:22.655 --> 20:25.556
But he won't
tell anyone, Willie.

20:25.558 --> 20:28.826
Besides, he's a hoodlum.
Who'd believe him?

20:30.063 --> 20:32.363
Well, Trevor, for one!

20:32.365 --> 20:35.099
No. Jake won't tell Trevor.

20:35.101 --> 20:37.668
I physically intimidated him.

20:37.670 --> 20:40.171
[scoffs]

20:40.173 --> 20:41.772
You?

20:41.774 --> 20:43.074
[snarling]

20:43.076 --> 20:46.043
Don't do that. Don't!

20:46.045 --> 20:47.478
Oh, stop it.

20:49.682 --> 20:51.616
What do you mean,
he can fix anything?

20:51.618 --> 20:53.851
- Look at the coffee maker.
- The..

20:53.853 --> 20:55.453
[snarling]

20:57.624 --> 21:00.358
Well, what happened
to the Jell-O?

21:00.360 --> 21:02.627
Jake cleaned it all out!

21:02.629 --> 21:06.264
So much for
my "Mr. Jell-O" machine.

21:06.266 --> 21:07.665
You stay here.

21:08.801 --> 21:10.134
[snarling]

21:12.739 --> 21:14.438
Uh, Jake.

21:14.440 --> 21:16.974
Uh, looks like
I owe you an apology.

21:16.976 --> 21:18.409
Apology?

21:18.411 --> 21:20.978
That biscuit
cause brain damage?

21:20.980 --> 21:22.313
Trevor..

21:22.315 --> 21:25.283
It seems that he really was
fixing the tape recorder.

21:25.285 --> 21:26.817
I just found out from--

21:26.819 --> 21:28.386
- Mom.
- Right.

21:29.555 --> 21:32.456
Bet you feel like
a real jerk, huh?

21:32.458 --> 21:34.325
Yeah.

21:34.327 --> 21:35.993
Hey, listen, kid,
I'm real sorry.

21:35.995 --> 21:39.130
Is Aunty Raquel still gonna
send me to bed without supper?

21:39.132 --> 21:40.931
Ha. Of course not.

21:40.933 --> 21:42.933
Rats.

21:42.935 --> 21:45.670
You know, Trevor,
it seems this young man

21:45.672 --> 21:48.439
is a little Mr. Fix-It.

21:48.441 --> 21:50.308
Little Mr. Fix-It.

21:50.310 --> 21:52.109
How cute.

21:52.111 --> 21:53.978
You want me, don't ya?

21:56.749 --> 21:58.849
You know, you oughta get him
some tools of his own.

21:58.851 --> 22:01.285
He could fix things
around your house.

22:01.287 --> 22:04.488
Yeah. You think you could fix
our Christmas lights?

22:04.490 --> 22:06.424
They stopped blinkin' in June.

22:06.426 --> 22:07.625
Oh, sure.

22:07.627 --> 22:10.528
I could even fix
your outdoor PA system.

22:10.530 --> 22:13.030
Oh, please don't.

22:13.032 --> 22:15.099
Hey, Willie, can we borrow
some of your tools?

22:15.101 --> 22:17.835
Sure, they're in your garage.

22:17.837 --> 22:20.638
Oh, yeah.
Come on, Jake. Let's go.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.873
- Goodbye, everybody.
- Bye.

22:22.875 --> 22:25.943
Oh, and tell Jay Leno
I said "Hi."

22:27.380 --> 22:29.914
Everybody knows
this Jay Leno, except me.

22:34.354 --> 22:36.987
What a strange family.

22:36.989 --> 22:38.122
[ALF snarling]

22:41.194 --> 22:43.327
Which one?

22:43.329 --> 22:47.198
- Now what do you want?
- Nothing.

22:47.200 --> 22:51.068
I was just doing the
Heimlich maneuver on myself.

22:51.070 --> 22:52.703
[gagging]

22:52.705 --> 22:54.905
[instrumental music]

22:56.743 --> 22:59.143
[instrumental music]

22:59.145 --> 23:00.611
Where's the..

23:02.014 --> 23:03.080
Ah.

23:04.717 --> 23:06.484
That piece doesn't fit there.

23:06.486 --> 23:07.818
Yes, it does.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.323
<i> Voila.</i>

23:12.325 --> 23:14.825
Now Mickey's eye
is in his nose.

23:14.827 --> 23:17.928
Now he can see
what he's smelling!

23:17.930 --> 23:19.997
Mr. Ochmonek
found his peat moss.

23:19.999 --> 23:24.001
It was in his dining room
behind a bag of rock salt.

23:24.003 --> 23:26.103
Hm. Did Jake fix
your hair dryer?
