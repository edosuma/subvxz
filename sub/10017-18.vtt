00:56.850 --> 00:59.679
Oh, God, what time is it?

01:00.982 --> 01:02.379
It's late.

01:02.847 --> 01:04.744
Go back to sleep, Natalie.

01:06.845 --> 01:09.901
- What?
- I said, go back to sleep.

01:11.144 --> 01:14.075
You just called me Natalie.

01:15.309 --> 01:16.967
It's not Natalie?

01:18.740 --> 01:21.227
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

01:21.439 --> 01:25.301
I forgot your name too. Don?

01:25.504 --> 01:27.435
- Doug.
- Doug.

01:28.269 --> 01:29.700
Pamela.

01:29.869 --> 01:31.924
- Hi, Pamela.
- Hi.

01:39.530 --> 01:42.359
- You going someplace?
- Work.

01:42.928 --> 01:45.757
- At 4 a. M?
- A man's gotta eat.

01:50.026 --> 01:52.786
- I'll call you.
- No, you won't.

01:54.623 --> 01:56.485
Don't let the cat out.

02:43.101 --> 02:45.691
Damn! It's cold out!

02:49.831 --> 02:51.057
Slow night?

02:51.264 --> 02:52.990
Calm before the storm.

02:53.196 --> 02:55.127
In a little early, aren't you?

02:55.328 --> 02:58.554
Actually, I am a dedicated
pediatric resident...

02:58.760 --> 03:03.020
...struggling to fulfill the promise
of a brilliant early career.

03:03.725 --> 03:05.916
- You been drinking?
- I wish.

03:06.156 --> 03:08.519
Nobody's in 4 if you want
to get a few winks.

03:08.722 --> 03:11.244
No, I'll just catch up on
some paperwork. Thanks.

03:24.348 --> 03:26.745
- You're in early.
- You're in late.

03:26.947 --> 03:29.377
I'm waiting for somebody
to pick up Tatiana.

03:29.579 --> 03:32.237
Children Services said
they'd be here by midnight.

03:32.445 --> 03:34.342
Did they say what year?

03:34.543 --> 03:36.270
Nice shirt. Sleep in it?

03:36.476 --> 03:38.236
Something like that.
You working today?

03:38.641 --> 03:40.731
Yep. On at 7.

03:41.307 --> 03:43.464
Get a couple hours,
I'll watch Tatiana.

03:44.771 --> 03:47.998
- Really?
- Yeah, I can practice up on my Russian.

03:48.737 --> 03:50.395
She's in 3.

03:51.969 --> 03:53.025
Thanks, Doug.

03:54.267 --> 03:56.130
What are friends for?

03:59.498 --> 04:01.962
I know, I'm early.

04:51.174 --> 04:52.832
Hi.

04:54.439 --> 04:55.496
Hi.

04:56.705 --> 04:57.965
Oh, God.

04:59.870 --> 05:01.392
Hi yourself, kid.

05:04.202 --> 05:05.894
Baby, leave Uncle Peter alone.

05:06.100 --> 05:07.656
Now go on upstairs. Go.

05:07.866 --> 05:09.263
Put some clothes on.

05:13.530 --> 05:16.290
Sorry, honey. I was trying
to let you get some sleep.

05:19.394 --> 05:22.382
- What time is it?
- It's about 6:30.

05:22.760 --> 05:27.156
I was gonna make you go home last night,
but you were snoring to wake the dead.

05:28.224 --> 05:29.711
I do not snore.

05:30.589 --> 05:32.918
Worse than Daddy used to.

05:35.053 --> 05:37.109
Oh, man.

05:39.385 --> 05:41.646
Look what the cat dragged in.

05:41.851 --> 05:44.543
- Any juice?
- That blood on your shoes?

05:44.749 --> 05:46.442
- Probably.
- Damn.

05:46.648 --> 05:50.044
- She give you any trouble last night?
- No. She went to bed early.

05:50.246 --> 05:52.677
- Hey, how was the movie?
- Wack.

05:52.878 --> 05:55.139
- Jesse liked it.
- Jesse's 4.

05:56.077 --> 05:58.667
You gonna make it back
in time for dinner?

05:58.876 --> 06:00.738
I don't watch her on Thursdays.

06:00.941 --> 06:02.804
It's the 16th, Peter.

06:03.140 --> 06:04.935
Mommy's birthday?

06:05.839 --> 06:10.031
- Oh, yeah. Today?
- Yeah. For the last 76 years.

06:10.237 --> 06:12.929
Come on, kids,
the "dad bus" is leaving.

06:13.136 --> 06:15.293
Steven, come straight home
from basketball.

06:15.501 --> 06:17.988
Don't make me send
your father after you.

06:18.200 --> 06:19.223
Here.

06:20.533 --> 06:22.464
Where you going without your books?

06:24.430 --> 06:27.986
I don't know what this lipstick
is about, but we'll talk about this.

06:31.461 --> 06:33.153
So you're not coming?

06:33.360 --> 06:35.824
No, no, no. I'm coming.

06:36.725 --> 06:39.417
I just gotta figure something out,
that's all.

06:40.990 --> 06:42.250
Lamb?

06:42.456 --> 06:44.943
- Standing rib roast.
- Right.

06:45.155 --> 06:48.210
The American Heart Association diet,
right?

06:48.520 --> 06:50.007
Hey, it's what she likes.

06:50.218 --> 06:52.649
- And it won't kill you.
- It might.

06:53.617 --> 06:55.479
Please don't disappoint her.

06:55.682 --> 06:58.511
You're the only one
she really remembers anymore.

07:00.747 --> 07:02.575
Jackie, I'll be here.

07:05.578 --> 07:06.975
I'll be here.

07:55.488 --> 07:58.476
- I've been on for 24 hours.
- I'll take Christmas, New Year's...

07:58.653 --> 08:01.913
...Thanksgiving, 4th of July.
- You owe me three days already.

08:02.119 --> 08:06.606
All your hemorrhoid cases for a year,
half my future practice, my first born.

08:06.816 --> 08:09.212
Hey, man, it's my mother.

08:09.415 --> 08:11.607
She's sick. I need to be there.

08:11.813 --> 08:14.301
Not this time, Peter.
I can't. Sorry.

08:19.176 --> 08:22.369
- Lily, get Psych down here now!
- What's happening?

08:22.576 --> 08:26.097
A guy poured gasoline all over himself.
Says he'll drop a match.

08:26.307 --> 08:27.795
- Is he serious?
- Who knows?

08:27.973 --> 08:30.063
But I'm looking for marshmallows.

08:30.271 --> 08:33.429
- Get any closer, and I'll do it!
- You don't want to do this.

08:33.635 --> 08:34.727
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.

08:34.902 --> 08:36.491
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.

08:36.735 --> 08:39.664
Yes, I do.
What, are we arguing? I do!

08:41.100 --> 08:42.759
Back up! Back up!

08:42.966 --> 08:44.487
I'm backing up.

08:45.164 --> 08:47.186
You'll set off the sprinkler system...

08:47.397 --> 08:50.919
...and you'll just be a bald guy
with no facial hair and a bad sunburn.

08:51.129 --> 08:52.753
You don't have a sprinkler system.

08:55.094 --> 08:56.956
We don't have a sprinkler system?

08:58.225 --> 09:00.781
All right.
We can talk about this, right?

09:01.391 --> 09:05.321
We can, because I don't wanna see you
hurt yourself or anybody else.

09:05.521 --> 09:07.918
So let me be your friend here, okay?

09:08.121 --> 09:09.416
I can be your friend.

09:10.020 --> 09:11.848
Please? Come on.

09:19.215 --> 09:21.078
When you're finished, Dr. Freud...

09:21.281 --> 09:24.178
...Sparky there will need
an eyewash and a shower.

09:28.911 --> 09:29.899
Daddy.

09:30.110 --> 09:32.473
There's something
you don't see every day.

09:32.942 --> 09:34.703
He climbed up on a chair in our den...

09:34.908 --> 09:36.964
...stuck his head in
and started screaming.

09:37.174 --> 09:38.469
He's bleeding a little bit.

09:38.673 --> 09:41.637
- It hurts.
- The teeth are jammed into his neck.

09:43.438 --> 09:45.300
Hang in there, buddy.
We'll get you out.

09:45.503 --> 09:48.729
<i>I took him to see The Lion King</i>
for the ninth time last night.

09:48.935 --> 09:51.922
<i>This is the thanks I get.</i>
No more Lion King, Gus, you hear me?

09:52.267 --> 09:54.255
- No more!
- Daddy...

09:55.432 --> 09:56.557
Did you bag this?

09:56.764 --> 10:00.160
Great grandfather bagged it
in India with Teddy Roosevelt.

10:01.729 --> 10:03.092
Sorry. When did it happen?

10:03.295 --> 10:05.623
1910. They were in the Punjab, I think.

10:05.827 --> 10:08.758
I mean, when did this get stuck
on Gus's head?

10:09.691 --> 10:11.281
Half an hour ago.

10:11.491 --> 10:14.546
I might've made it a little worse
trying to pull it off.

10:16.056 --> 10:19.111
He'll need some stitches.
Malik, get me a bone saw.

10:19.354 --> 10:22.376
Hold on. You're gonna
cut into my kid's neck?

10:22.585 --> 10:24.880
We're gonna saw the jaw off the tiger.

10:25.085 --> 10:26.982
It's been in my family for 90 years!

10:27.184 --> 10:30.114
I mean, it's historical for God's sake.

10:30.315 --> 10:33.438
I mean, gee, Teddy Roosevelt.

10:36.346 --> 10:40.436
Seventeen-year-old female,
BP's 90 over 60, pulse 108.

10:40.644 --> 10:42.666
Empty bottles of vodka and brandy...

10:42.876 --> 10:45.602
...Valium, Flexeril, Darvon.

10:45.808 --> 10:49.466
Father thinks she might have others
stashed away somewhere. No note.

10:49.673 --> 10:51.604
Okay, ready? On three.

10:51.805 --> 10:54.168
One, two, three.

10:54.438 --> 10:57.834
Let's get a CBC, Chem-7,
cath urine for Rud's...

10:58.036 --> 10:59.967
...a tox screen and a blood alcohol.

11:00.168 --> 11:02.826
- What have you got?
- One of your old favorites, Rene.

11:03.034 --> 11:06.226
Rene! It's been a long time.
What, a couple of weeks?

11:06.432 --> 11:09.022
Rene. Rene?

11:09.197 --> 11:12.559
- What are you on, Rene?
- I got a headache.

11:12.763 --> 11:14.523
I bet you do have a headache.

11:14.728 --> 11:15.886
Give me something.

11:16.094 --> 11:20.149
- Something? Were you thinking aspirin?
- No.

11:20.358 --> 11:23.948
You're not getting Demerol, Rene,
so forget it. Lavage?

11:24.157 --> 11:26.213
Ewald tube. Saline, 3 liters.

11:26.423 --> 11:28.251
I'll get the charcoal.

11:28.621 --> 11:30.984
It's stomach pump time, Rene.

11:31.187 --> 11:35.049
Calm down or this is going down
your nose. You know you hate that.

11:35.252 --> 11:38.444
So who brought her in this time?
Her dad or the creep?

11:38.650 --> 11:40.047
Her dad.

11:40.249 --> 11:44.179
You know, if we gave out Green Stamps,
Rene'd have a car by now.

11:46.246 --> 11:48.643
People at Sunshine House
agreed to take her in.

11:48.846 --> 11:51.674
- They're set up for AIDS kids?
- That's all they do.

11:51.877 --> 11:56.205
- What are her chances of adoption?
- With advanced AIDS? Zero.

11:56.608 --> 12:00.095
- There's foster care.
- So she goes there to die.

12:01.140 --> 12:03.798
The people at the hospice are great.

12:04.005 --> 12:08.060
She'll be with other kids. There's
full-time nursing care, teachers.

12:08.269 --> 12:10.564
She's fortunate there is
a Sunshine House.

12:10.768 --> 12:12.666
Yeah, it's her lucky day.

12:13.401 --> 12:15.127
She's in here?

12:20.263 --> 12:21.819
Tatiana...

12:38.655 --> 12:40.916
What's she saying?

12:41.821 --> 12:43.615
She doesn't wanna go.

12:46.951 --> 12:48.746
Hi, Tatiana.

12:51.216 --> 12:53.010
I like your doll.

12:53.948 --> 12:55.674
What's her name?

13:02.577 --> 13:03.974
Anya.

13:06.209 --> 13:07.935
That's a very pretty name.

13:10.074 --> 13:11.596
Tatiana...

13:12.007 --> 13:14.096
...you need to come with me.

13:15.339 --> 13:16.826
Please?

13:54.420 --> 13:56.976
Let's start an IV.
Five milligrams morphine.

13:57.185 --> 13:59.309
- How'd this happen, Mr. Kazuo?
- Boning fish.

13:59.518 --> 14:02.505
Let's get a CBC, Ancef IV and a DT.

14:02.716 --> 14:05.237
- X-ray?
- Yeah. Where's your finger?

14:05.448 --> 14:07.038
I couldn't find it.
It hurt too much.

14:07.247 --> 14:10.303
If we can find it,
we may be able to reattach it.

14:10.513 --> 14:13.500
- The guys brought the crate in.
- Dr. Benton?

14:14.144 --> 14:15.507
All right. Carter, Chen!

14:15.710 --> 14:17.073
Let's go.

14:18.609 --> 14:24.164
All right. The good news is, the finger's
on ice. The bad news is, it's in here. Dig in.

14:24.339 --> 14:25.929
Get the replantation team up here.

14:26.139 --> 14:30.194
Carter, Chen, move! If the tissue freezes,
you might as well serve it as sushi.

14:39.166 --> 14:41.255
Rene's gonna be okay.

14:41.464 --> 14:43.395
We pumped your daughter's stomach.

14:43.597 --> 14:45.721
Tox screen showed cannabis...

14:45.930 --> 14:48.758
...opiates, benzodiazepines.

14:48.961 --> 14:52.323
Her blood alcohol level was 3.75.

14:52.793 --> 14:54.916
She had a fight with her boyfriend.

14:55.125 --> 14:57.454
Said she wanted to kill herself.

14:58.323 --> 15:01.049
You want me to get Psych
down here again?

15:01.289 --> 15:05.981
What for? They'll just let her out
in a couple of days.

15:08.185 --> 15:11.513
Have you thought about any
inpatient treatment centers for Rene?

15:12.017 --> 15:13.539
When we did that...

15:14.216 --> 15:15.909
...she cut her wrists.

15:17.748 --> 15:19.906
What am I gonna do?

15:20.380 --> 15:21.902
Oh, God!

15:29.509 --> 15:32.371
Have you decided what you'll do
in your Sub-I next year?

15:32.574 --> 15:36.732
My elective? I don't know.
We have a couple of months to decide.

15:36.939 --> 15:39.597
Sure, but the good ones
are gonna be long gone.

15:40.404 --> 15:44.595
- I thought we just had to sign up.
- No, it's really competitive.

15:47.867 --> 15:51.161
- I was thinking about just staying here.
- Trauma placement?

15:51.366 --> 15:53.830
They've already got 12 requests
for the one spot.

15:54.031 --> 15:55.757
In the ER?

15:55.963 --> 16:00.586
We're here, so we have the inside track,
but it's the resident's decision.

16:01.693 --> 16:02.920
Benton?

16:03.593 --> 16:07.852
It's not supposed to be, but they
always go with who the resident wants.

16:08.057 --> 16:09.716
So have you already applied?

16:09.923 --> 16:12.320
Are you kidding?
As soon as I got here.

16:12.521 --> 16:15.112
I didn't want Benton to think
I wasn't interested and...

16:15.887 --> 16:17.409
I got it!

16:17.753 --> 16:19.581
He already told you?

16:19.852 --> 16:22.010
One missing digit.

16:23.516 --> 16:27.277
Six-year-old male, gunshot wound to
the back. C 7, T1 region, no exit wound.

16:27.481 --> 16:29.742
BP's 70 over 50, pulse 112.

16:29.947 --> 16:32.605
Oxygen 15 liters by mask.
Two large bore IVs wide open.

16:32.813 --> 16:37.004
All right, let's get him on my count.
Nice and gentle. One, two, three.

16:37.210 --> 16:39.300
Good bilateral breath sound.

16:39.509 --> 16:40.906
Blood coming up?

16:41.709 --> 16:43.606
IV's wide open!

16:43.807 --> 16:46.068
CBC, type and cross
four units packed cells.

16:46.273 --> 16:48.465
Four units O-neg. Let's move!

16:51.071 --> 16:54.365
C-spine and chest films, now!
I think we've got a cord injury.

16:54.569 --> 16:56.931
Okay, start a flow sheet.

16:57.301 --> 16:59.857
- He's gonna need a Foley.
- All right.

17:00.033 --> 17:03.464
- Good bilateral breath sounds.
- All right. Blood coming up.

17:06.097 --> 17:08.061
Are you hurt? Are you hurt too?

17:08.262 --> 17:10.954
I killed him. I killed Drew.

17:11.528 --> 17:13.084
Connie, get another gurney!

17:13.292 --> 17:15.723
- Switch him over to a dynamap!
- Where's that O-neg?

17:15.892 --> 17:17.517
- I killed him.
- He's in shock.

17:17.724 --> 17:19.781
- I killed Drew.
- Okay, here we go.

17:19.990 --> 17:22.182
I shot my brother.

17:22.755 --> 17:25.685
Let's get him on mask.
Start an IV of saline.

17:28.486 --> 17:30.314
I shot my brother.

17:34.017 --> 17:35.539
Got them.

17:37.349 --> 17:40.802
- Damn!
- C 7, T1 vertebrae.

17:41.013 --> 17:42.501
- Gardner-Wells?
- Yeah.

17:42.713 --> 17:46.837
All right, bolus 600 mgs
methylprednisolone over 15. Now!

17:47.045 --> 17:50.032
Start a Foley catheter and an NG tube.

18:01.971 --> 18:03.629
- The kid's father is here.
- I'll take him.

18:03.837 --> 18:06.064
Call neuro, and book an O.R.

18:07.668 --> 18:11.599
He was okay a couple of days ago.
Now he's confused, agitated.

18:11.866 --> 18:13.797
Dick. Dick?

18:14.798 --> 18:17.558
Mr. Thornberg, do you
know where you are?

18:17.963 --> 18:20.621
- Do you know what day it is?
- Will you scratch that for me?

18:20.795 --> 18:23.624
- It itches like crazy.
- Do you know where you are?

18:23.828 --> 18:26.224
Dick, damn it, I'm telling you.

18:26.426 --> 18:30.322
- Has he been sick, on any medications?
- He has lung cancer.

18:30.524 --> 18:31.887
Chemo? Radiation?

18:32.089 --> 18:33.816
They gave up a couple months ago.

18:34.089 --> 18:36.145
Come on, Dick.

18:37.488 --> 18:40.452
Let's get a CBC, lytes, calcium level.

18:40.653 --> 18:42.311
- Want an EKG?
- Yeah.

18:43.351 --> 18:45.043
I'll get somebody.

18:45.417 --> 18:47.405
Are you Mrs. Thornberg?

18:48.049 --> 18:49.037
No.

18:49.248 --> 18:50.770
Just a friend.

18:50.981 --> 18:52.741
Have you contacted his family?

18:52.947 --> 18:55.844
He's got a daughter,
but they're not in touch.

18:56.045 --> 18:58.771
- Can I please stay with him?
- Sure, sure.

18:59.644 --> 19:00.632
Hey, Mark, Susan.

19:00.843 --> 19:04.796
We've got end-stage lung cancer
with altered mental status in 1.

19:06.507 --> 19:08.301
One, two, three.

19:08.506 --> 19:11.528
Don't let the screen door hit you
on your butt on the way out.

19:15.670 --> 19:17.191
What is that smell?

19:17.402 --> 19:18.628
Halibut.

19:20.967 --> 19:22.193
Dr. Benton?

19:23.999 --> 19:27.259
Walt, come on, man.
You know how I feel about birthdays.

19:27.731 --> 19:30.560
All right. I gave my word.
I'll be there.

19:30.762 --> 19:33.625
Tell Jackie don't make
a big deal out of it.

19:33.828 --> 19:35.793
Okay, 7:00.

19:36.727 --> 19:37.987
Today your birthday?

19:38.192 --> 19:41.953
My personal life's my own.
Don't eavesdrop on my phone calls, okay?

19:42.158 --> 19:43.350
Sure.

19:43.557 --> 19:44.647
Sorry.

19:45.589 --> 19:48.917
- I had a question about Trauma Sub-I?
- What about it?

19:49.120 --> 19:52.778
I understand that 12 students have
already applied, and I was wondering...

19:52.986 --> 19:56.439
...if I was interested, can you tell me
what my chances would be?

19:56.650 --> 19:58.615
Twelve people have applied, right?

19:58.816 --> 20:00.042
With me, it'd be 13.

20:00.249 --> 20:02.679
Then I'd say your chances are 1 in 13.

20:04.813 --> 20:07.335
- You walked into that one.
- Yeah.

20:08.278 --> 20:09.971
The creep is here.

20:10.177 --> 20:14.471
- He's in the waiting room with Dad.
- Great. My day is complete.

20:15.375 --> 20:18.396
- It's Dr. Benton's birthday.
- Really? My daughter's too.

20:18.607 --> 20:20.469
- Should we do something?
- Like what?

20:20.672 --> 20:23.296
- I don't know. Throw a party?
- A party?

20:24.171 --> 20:25.500
He would hate it.

20:26.103 --> 20:29.465
Talk to Lydia, she can pull those
things together pretty quickly.

20:37.464 --> 20:38.929
Mr. Thomas?

20:39.297 --> 20:40.955
I'm Dr. Ross.

20:43.895 --> 20:46.860
The bullet entered your son's back.
It smashed his vertebrae.

20:47.060 --> 20:50.547
We need to do exploratory surgery
to determine the injuries.

20:50.759 --> 20:53.383
He has reflex activity
and anal sphincter tone...

20:53.591 --> 20:56.420
...both of which are hopeful signs.

20:58.554 --> 21:00.076
Kyle, stop it.

21:04.285 --> 21:05.875
Will my boy live?

21:08.083 --> 21:11.071
We don't know. It'll be a few hours.

21:12.981 --> 21:15.208
It doesn't look good.

21:15.947 --> 21:17.503
Kyle, stop it.

21:20.644 --> 21:21.870
I said, shut up!

21:28.041 --> 21:29.938
I'm sorry, son.

21:30.140 --> 21:32.661
That's okay, son. It's okay.

21:32.905 --> 21:34.598
I'm sorry, Kyle.

21:34.804 --> 21:36.894
It's gonna be all right.

21:42.068 --> 21:44.658
I always keep my guns locked up.

21:46.232 --> 21:48.061
I must've forgot.

21:50.530 --> 21:54.893
I told them to stay out of my room
a million times, but I must've forgot.

21:57.061 --> 21:59.889
Good Lord, I must've forgot.

22:03.391 --> 22:06.185
Hypercalcemia.
Normal saline 300cc's per hour...

22:06.390 --> 22:08.718
...and Diurese with 40 mgs Lasix IV.

22:09.388 --> 22:11.785
There's too much calcium
in his system. We'll get it out.

22:11.987 --> 22:14.281
- Is it from the cancer?
- It's not uncommon.

22:14.486 --> 22:16.882
He needs to see his oncologist
for a treatment...

22:17.085 --> 22:19.516
...to prevent this from happening again.

22:19.717 --> 22:21.307
It just gets worse and worse.

22:21.516 --> 22:25.707
He'll feel better in a couple of hours.
His calcium level wasn't that high.

22:28.713 --> 22:30.837
Mike's too stubborn to die.

22:31.045 --> 22:33.339
- Have you known him long?
- Not really.

22:33.544 --> 22:36.134
About a year. We met at church.

22:36.342 --> 22:38.307
He's a real character.

22:38.841 --> 22:40.170
He's fun to live with.

22:40.374 --> 22:41.498
You live together?

22:41.707 --> 22:45.399
No, no. It's not romantic or anything.
I liked him.

22:45.604 --> 22:47.160
Thought maybe I could help.

22:48.537 --> 22:50.002
He's a sweet guy.

22:50.636 --> 22:53.100
He's got no one, no family.

22:54.001 --> 22:56.830
It just seemed like
the right thing to do.

23:01.264 --> 23:03.195
I was trying to get rid of a headache.

23:03.396 --> 23:05.055
I wanna go home.

23:05.262 --> 23:06.921
You don't know what I want!

23:07.128 --> 23:09.990
Your father said you were
threatening to kill yourself?

23:10.193 --> 23:13.521
I was upset, you know.
T.J. And I had a fight, that's all.

23:13.725 --> 23:15.849
Can't you give her something
for the pain?

23:16.058 --> 23:17.818
You weren't considering suicide?

23:18.023 --> 23:19.249
She told you what happened.

23:19.456 --> 23:22.080
T.J., shut up.
You're not part of this family!

23:22.287 --> 23:24.650
Don't tell me to shut up.
Why don't you shut up!

23:24.853 --> 23:26.613
Leave him alone!

23:26.819 --> 23:28.613
Why don't you all shut up. Okay?

23:30.084 --> 23:33.742
So, Rene, you weren't trying to kill
yourself this morning?

23:35.148 --> 23:38.079
I just wanted to go to sleep.

23:38.713 --> 23:41.803
Why don't you check yourself in
voluntarily, get cleaned up.

23:42.011 --> 23:44.636
I wanna go home.

23:46.543 --> 23:48.065
I gotta get to work.

23:48.742 --> 23:50.468
Mr. Franks?

23:52.540 --> 23:53.766
Sure, whatever.

23:56.438 --> 23:57.495
Let her go.

24:05.001 --> 24:06.522
Dr. Benton.

24:09.799 --> 24:12.661
I understand you're anxious
to change your shift tonight.

24:13.897 --> 24:16.986
I was hoping to find
someone to cover for me.

24:17.195 --> 24:18.887
It's happened a lot lately.

24:19.727 --> 24:22.850
- A couple of times, yeah.
- Four times. I checked.

24:23.159 --> 24:25.919
It's not forbidden to swap shifts,
but we don't encourage it.

24:26.125 --> 24:28.056
- Dr. Hicks, l...
- No, let me finish.

24:28.257 --> 24:31.585
Dr. Morgenstern and I have spent
a lot of time with the schedule...

24:31.788 --> 24:35.446
...trying to provide every resident
with a well-rounded work experience.

24:35.654 --> 24:37.744
If you swap shifts,
you upset the balance.

24:37.952 --> 24:41.348
Peter, you've got two women
with abdominal pain in Curtain 2.

24:43.050 --> 24:44.208
My...

24:45.582 --> 24:46.706
My mother's been ill.

24:46.914 --> 24:48.845
It's always difficult.

24:49.546 --> 24:51.239
But if your mother's declining health...

24:51.445 --> 24:54.501
...becomes an impediment in
your completing your residency...

24:54.711 --> 24:56.971
...you may want to consider
taking a hiatus.

24:57.176 --> 24:59.368
- Peter?
- He'll be right there.

24:59.576 --> 25:02.166
It's not uncommon.
You're an excellent doctor.

25:02.374 --> 25:03.567
These things happen.

25:03.773 --> 25:05.636
You can rejoin the program next year.

25:08.471 --> 25:10.232
That won't be necessary.

25:10.770 --> 25:13.031
- So we understand each other?
- Yeah.

25:13.203 --> 25:14.395
Good.

25:18.833 --> 25:20.594
Sometime this century, Peter?

25:26.097 --> 25:29.550
They got some sort of abdominal
seizure from something they ate.

25:29.761 --> 25:32.624
BP's 50 over nothing!
I think they're crashing.

25:32.827 --> 25:34.122
What's wrong with them?

25:34.325 --> 25:36.449
I can't stop twitching.

25:36.658 --> 25:37.715
Their BP's racing!

25:37.924 --> 25:39.549
Oh, my God!

25:39.990 --> 25:41.615
Doctor, I can't stop!

25:41.822 --> 25:43.049
Carter, hold her down.

25:43.254 --> 25:44.549
Doctor, please, help me.

25:45.287 --> 25:46.446
I said hold her down!

25:53.284 --> 25:55.215
Happy birthday, Peter.

26:15.773 --> 26:17.829
Happy birthday, Dr. B.

26:26.934 --> 26:29.865
Paramedics brought in a baby.
Fell out of a second-story window.

26:30.067 --> 26:31.089
I need you.

26:38.263 --> 26:41.818
She's unresponsive. Skin's warm
and dry. Couldn't get an IV going.

26:42.027 --> 26:43.889
Cross-table and C-spine of the neck.

26:44.093 --> 26:47.524
- We have any beds in PICU?
- Cross two units. Get a head CT.

26:50.524 --> 26:52.455
- You the father?
- Yeah.

26:52.623 --> 26:53.815
How'd this happen?

26:54.021 --> 26:56.509
She fell off our balcony.

26:56.954 --> 26:59.919
How far?
How far did she fall?

27:00.385 --> 27:03.043
Maybe 15 feet onto the driveway.

27:03.251 --> 27:04.876
Pulse is strong.

27:05.883 --> 27:08.041
No bowel sounds.
Let's get an abdominal CT.

27:08.249 --> 27:11.804
- Get Benton in here!
- Moves all extremities to pain.

27:12.680 --> 27:15.668
Abdominal soft. Pelvis is stable.

27:16.477 --> 27:18.238
Tough day to be a kid.

27:32.970 --> 27:34.492
I hate it.

27:35.069 --> 27:38.262
- That is a beautiful church.
- It's a mausoleum.

27:38.935 --> 27:41.627
My family's been coming here for years.

27:42.465 --> 27:45.157
Let's rent Soldier Field.
We can invite fewer guests.

27:45.364 --> 27:47.454
We don't have to fill it up.

27:49.462 --> 27:51.324
Beth got married there.
It was lovely.

27:51.528 --> 27:54.981
Your sister, great. Maybe I can
borrow her wedding dress too.

27:55.193 --> 27:58.748
Look, Tag, you know what?
I hate it, okay? Isn't that enough?

27:58.958 --> 28:00.923
Sure. Fine.

28:02.757 --> 28:04.221
I'm sorry.

28:05.588 --> 28:08.610
I'm tired.
I was up all night with Tatiana.

28:10.920 --> 28:12.782
I'm worried about her.

28:14.051 --> 28:17.174
I was thinking maybe I could
do more to help her.

28:19.049 --> 28:20.604
I was thinking...

28:21.347 --> 28:23.403
...maybe we could adopt her.

28:28.444 --> 28:30.931
You want to adopt a kid with AIDS?

28:31.976 --> 28:36.201
She doesn't have anybody, doesn't speak
the language. She's completely alone.

28:36.374 --> 28:38.236
How advanced is the virus?

28:38.406 --> 28:39.632
She doesn't have long.

28:39.839 --> 28:42.531
- A month? A year?
- What difference does it make?

28:42.738 --> 28:44.294
We could be watching her die
for years.

28:49.535 --> 28:52.364
Why do you have to do this now,
three months before the wedding?

28:52.566 --> 28:54.690
Because she needs us now.

28:55.798 --> 28:58.694
If I don't want to do this,
does it make me a bad person?

29:01.296 --> 29:02.625
No.

29:06.493 --> 29:08.583
I have to get back to the hospital.

29:13.357 --> 29:15.288
Carter, it isn't my birthday.

29:15.489 --> 29:17.545
No, no. I heard you on the phone.

29:17.754 --> 29:20.151
I was talking about
my mother's birthday.

29:20.786 --> 29:22.751
Happy birthday, Dr. B!

29:26.084 --> 29:27.310
Mary.

29:27.517 --> 29:29.539
Hey, Mark, what happened with Rene?

29:29.849 --> 29:32.813
Gone home. Her dad signed her out.

29:33.014 --> 29:37.706
I've got this rule out MI in 1.
Today is his 60th wedding anniversary.

29:37.912 --> 29:40.536
Sixty? My record's sixty weeks.

29:40.744 --> 29:42.834
- I'll never get married.
- Yes, you will.

29:43.042 --> 29:46.529
I don't know. All the marriages
I know are pretty rocky.

29:47.040 --> 29:49.028
Well, thank you very much.

29:50.240 --> 29:52.431
Jerry, I need the Olan chart.

29:55.037 --> 29:57.365
Where are the lab results
from the MVA in 4?

29:57.569 --> 29:59.727
- I ate them.
- Well, I need them.

30:03.033 --> 30:04.430
Your sister called.

30:04.999 --> 30:06.294
Twice.

30:06.499 --> 30:08.225
Peter, another MVA coming in.

30:08.431 --> 30:10.259
- How long?
- Six minutes.

30:10.463 --> 30:11.826
Sounds pretty bad.

30:12.029 --> 30:13.221
ER.

30:15.194 --> 30:18.250
Excuse me.
Is Dr. Ross working today?

30:18.459 --> 30:21.549
- He's with a patient.
- Can you tell him I'm looking for him?

30:21.757 --> 30:22.984
Diane Leeds.

30:23.190 --> 30:26.985
Sorry. Yeah, it's gonna be
a little bit later than that.

30:38.816 --> 30:40.111
Dr. Benton?

30:45.047 --> 30:48.273
- The check didn't bounce, did it?
- It isn't going to, is it?

30:48.812 --> 30:52.833
I haven't had time to make a deposit.
I'll do that first thing in the morning.

30:53.043 --> 30:56.940
That's fine. I was hoping to catch
a ride to the birthday party tonight.

30:58.007 --> 31:01.460
She invited me, and I'd like to go
if you can give me a lift.

31:02.939 --> 31:04.336
Where's your car?

31:04.538 --> 31:05.833
In the shop.

31:06.237 --> 31:08.668
My husband can pick me up afterwards.

31:09.236 --> 31:11.064
I didn't know you were married.

31:12.434 --> 31:14.955
I take it off
when I work with patients.

31:15.566 --> 31:17.690
Happy birthday, Peter!

31:20.198 --> 31:24.628
- You and your mom have the same birthday?
- No, it's a long story.

31:24.829 --> 31:26.953
So can you give me a ride or not?

31:28.160 --> 31:30.716
I don't even know if
I'm gonna make it.

31:30.926 --> 31:33.891
You'd better catch another ride
somewhere else, okay?

31:39.055 --> 31:41.815
- How long has he had this cold?
- Couple of weeks.

31:42.021 --> 31:46.542
He keeps getting sick this winter,
and he's falling asleep in class.

31:46.752 --> 31:49.773
Dr. Ross, woman at the front desk
looking for you. Her name is Leeds.

31:49.983 --> 31:52.743
Tell her I'll be there
as soon as I can.

31:52.949 --> 31:56.141
All right, kiddo, open up for me.
Let's take a look.

31:56.347 --> 31:58.403
When's the last time
Billy saw a dentist?

31:59.579 --> 32:01.044
I don't know.

32:01.844 --> 32:03.366
Last year?

32:04.210 --> 32:08.402
All right, kiddo. Let's put your
shirt back on. It's cold in here. Okay?

32:08.575 --> 32:10.039
All right.

32:10.207 --> 32:13.433
He's anemic, Mrs. Larson.
He's not getting enough iron.

32:13.639 --> 32:15.127
So he needs some vitamins?

32:15.338 --> 32:20.267
What he really needs is a better diet.
Some vegetables, grain, meat, milk.

32:20.469 --> 32:24.025
- He's malnourished.
- I try to get him some meat every week.

32:24.234 --> 32:28.028
You're gonna have to do more than that.
Are you on food stamps?

32:28.899 --> 32:31.295
- How many kids do you have?
- Four.

32:31.497 --> 32:36.018
In the winter, after I pay for the heat,
there isn't much left to go around.

32:36.228 --> 32:39.022
Dr. Ross, that kid who fell
out of the window? I need you.

32:39.760 --> 32:42.724
You'll have to get more food
for your children to eat.

32:42.925 --> 32:47.219
Lydia will give you the name of several
food banks and some church groups...

32:47.424 --> 32:48.911
...who feed families.

32:49.122 --> 32:52.450
- I won't go to a shelter.
- You just go there for the food.

32:52.654 --> 32:56.448
- I can feed my kids.
- Your son's teeth are rotting.

32:56.652 --> 32:59.549
Get the food wherever you can, okay?

32:59.750 --> 33:01.340
Thank you, Lydia.

33:06.081 --> 33:08.546
Kid's starving to death
in downtown Chicago.

33:08.746 --> 33:10.336
- What?
- We got those x-rays.

33:10.546 --> 33:14.408
Neck film was fine, so we undid the
backboard and cervical restraint...

33:14.611 --> 33:17.098
...and rolled her over
to check her back.

33:17.309 --> 33:19.365
I think you should see for yourself.

33:20.608 --> 33:21.834
Hey, honey.

33:25.572 --> 33:27.264
Son of a bitch!

33:27.771 --> 33:29.259
Dr. Ross!

33:29.770 --> 33:32.258
- What is that?
- A footprint.

33:40.432 --> 33:41.419
Thanks for coming...

33:41.631 --> 33:43.256
Let me see your foot.

33:45.496 --> 33:46.484
Son of a bitch!

33:53.359 --> 33:54.914
I'm all right!

33:56.824 --> 33:58.050
I'm all right.

34:03.488 --> 34:04.953
I'm all right.

34:34.206 --> 34:36.670
I really screwed up this time, huh?

34:39.204 --> 34:40.533
Yeah, you did.

34:40.737 --> 34:43.565
- Is he gonna press charges?
- I doubt it.

34:43.768 --> 34:47.893
I don't think he wants his friends to
know that a pediatrician beat him up.

34:48.467 --> 34:50.193
He's got other problems.

34:50.399 --> 34:55.125
Two detectives from Domestic Violence
are talking to him in the lounge now.

34:55.330 --> 34:56.885
God, it's freezing out here!

34:57.096 --> 34:59.061
I won't say I'm sorry,
because I'm not.

34:59.261 --> 35:00.556
Then don't.

35:01.760 --> 35:03.385
So, what happens now?

35:03.759 --> 35:05.883
- I had to tell Morgenstern.
- What'd he say?

35:06.092 --> 35:10.045
He wasn't very happy. I think you're
looking at ink blots, couch time...

35:10.256 --> 35:12.550
...probably Resident Review Committee.

35:18.553 --> 35:20.211
Your friend's still here.

35:21.651 --> 35:23.479
- What?
- The brunette.

35:23.683 --> 35:25.773
She's waiting for you at Admitting.

35:31.080 --> 35:32.602
I'm heading home.

35:33.279 --> 35:35.869
Tell Rachel happy birthday.
It's her birthday, right?

35:36.078 --> 35:39.338
I was supposed to be there an hour ago.
Jennifer's gonna kill me.

35:39.543 --> 35:42.099
- Tell her it's my fault.
- I always do.

35:54.269 --> 35:56.961
Mr. Thornberg, you can't smoke
inside the hospital.

35:57.168 --> 35:58.656
What're you gonna do, arrest me?

35:58.866 --> 36:01.888
- You could blow yourself up.
- Well, that hasn't happened yet.

36:03.964 --> 36:05.395
Mr. Thornberg...

36:05.597 --> 36:07.891
...you have lung cancer.

36:08.096 --> 36:11.288
One more won't make any difference now.

36:15.426 --> 36:16.982
There, you see?

36:17.192 --> 36:19.679
Now you don't have to arrest me.

36:28.153 --> 36:32.447
BP 110 over 70, pulse 108,
resp's 24, GCS 15.

36:32.651 --> 36:34.616
Defensive wounds on hands and forearms.

36:34.817 --> 36:36.748
He's stable.
What's he doing in Trauma?

36:36.948 --> 36:39.970
Except for that knife sticking
out of his chest, he's fine.

36:40.181 --> 36:43.339
He's had 15 liters of oxygen.
He's high, so we restrained him.

36:43.546 --> 36:45.170
I think it's in his heart.

36:46.312 --> 36:48.640
Lookie here, a swastika.

36:49.209 --> 36:51.766
I got a "Die, nigger, die" here.

36:53.441 --> 36:54.804
How do you feel about Asians?

36:56.140 --> 36:58.866
He took a crowbar to a black kid
on West Adams.

36:59.072 --> 37:01.037
Another brother jumped him
with the knife.

37:01.238 --> 37:04.259
Maybe somebody ought to drive
the knife all the way through.

37:05.269 --> 37:09.563
Let's do your damn jobs. Get a CBC,
type and cross 8 units, 0.8 Narcan...

37:09.767 --> 37:13.061
...check the glucose and
get a portable x-ray! Move!

37:26.959 --> 37:28.185
Are you all right?

37:28.392 --> 37:31.845
I'm fine.
I hurt my hand a little bit.

37:33.223 --> 37:34.983
You wanted to talk to me?

37:35.188 --> 37:39.618
About Jake. I'll come back tomorrow if
you promise not to beat anyone else up.

37:39.819 --> 37:41.841
Well, it's not a daily event.

37:44.584 --> 37:46.674
I just wanted to make sure
you were okay.

37:52.514 --> 37:55.376
Have someone take a look at that.
It might be broken.

38:01.143 --> 38:04.630
<i>- Lydia, como esta?</i>
- Muy bien. I'm going home, aren't I?

38:04.841 --> 38:07.601
All right! Rolando, my man.

38:08.905 --> 38:10.370
What's up, Jerry?

38:11.171 --> 38:12.830
Easy day, huh?

38:13.737 --> 38:16.395
When Benton comes down,
tell him his sister's been calling...

38:16.602 --> 38:19.726
...every five minutes
for the last two hours.

38:19.934 --> 38:22.229
Make sure Mr. Thornberg
gets moved upstairs.

38:22.433 --> 38:26.420
And there's a rule out MI in 1 waiting
on labs. Can you call, please?

38:27.164 --> 38:29.424
- Good night, all.
- Good night.

38:29.596 --> 38:31.993
- Who's on tonight?
- Me and Benton.

38:36.226 --> 38:39.191
- We didn't lose a single patient today.
- No kidding, really?

38:39.392 --> 38:41.948
Benton's still got that knife wound
up in the O.R.

38:42.157 --> 38:43.247
Close enough.

38:43.490 --> 38:44.750
Good night.

38:47.121 --> 38:48.314
ER.

38:49.853 --> 38:52.818
The muscles of the left ventricle
are holding the knife in place.

38:53.019 --> 38:57.040
We'll begin with a median sternotomy
to expose the structures around the knife.

38:57.250 --> 39:01.647
We'll open the pericardial sac, extract
the knife, tamponading the wound...

39:01.848 --> 39:06.777
...as you make horizontal mattress
sutures to avoid the coronary arteries.

39:07.612 --> 39:09.736
We'll be out of there in no time.

39:11.477 --> 39:13.703
Dr. Benton,
your sister's on line 2.

39:13.909 --> 39:16.339
I'll have to call her back.

39:16.541 --> 39:19.006
You cut, I'll watch.

39:22.038 --> 39:25.628
We don't accept kids over 10, so she'll
have plenty of kids to play with.

39:25.837 --> 39:28.858
We're full right now,
so we put Tatiana in the infant room.

39:29.069 --> 39:32.431
We'll move her into her own age group
as soon as there's an opening.

39:47.627 --> 39:49.353
Hi, Tatiana.

39:50.125 --> 39:51.749
You okay?

39:56.889 --> 39:58.615
Oh, that's right!

39:59.254 --> 40:00.776
She's very pretty.

40:00.987 --> 40:02.543
You speak Russian?

40:03.153 --> 40:04.550
Just a little.

40:06.251 --> 40:07.739
Just a little.

40:27.775 --> 40:28.865
Daddy!

40:30.140 --> 40:32.332
- Happy birthday!
- Thanks. Bye.

40:32.539 --> 40:34.730
Bye? Kiss first.

40:43.934 --> 40:45.592
Thanks for getting home in time.

40:45.799 --> 40:47.764
I couldn't get away. I'm sorry.

40:47.965 --> 40:49.725
It's okay. Craig helped.

40:49.931 --> 40:50.954
Craig?

40:51.829 --> 40:53.419
You know, the other clerk.

41:03.791 --> 41:07.017
- Where is young Craig?
- Store. We ran out of ice cream.

41:08.688 --> 41:09.984
Rachel loved her gift.

41:10.188 --> 41:12.585
- What'd we get her?
- Super NES.

41:12.786 --> 41:14.047
We weren't gonna do that.

41:14.686 --> 41:18.048
She asked five times a day
for three months, so I gave in.

41:26.480 --> 41:27.877
So you found time?

41:28.079 --> 41:29.907
It's from Susan Lewis.

41:32.744 --> 41:34.334
Don't start.

41:41.706 --> 41:44.136
Judge Franklin asked me
to clerk again next year.

41:45.205 --> 41:47.329
- And?
- I'm going to do it.

41:50.069 --> 41:52.057
No running in the house!

41:59.331 --> 42:01.125
That's it? You just decided?

42:01.330 --> 42:04.124
You made your decision unilaterally.

42:04.463 --> 42:06.291
Now I've made mine.

42:11.459 --> 42:13.288
Did I miss it? Is the party over?

42:13.491 --> 42:15.286
About an hour ago.

42:16.257 --> 42:18.847
- She still up?
- No.

42:20.156 --> 42:21.620
She's asleep.

42:26.452 --> 42:27.645
Jackie, I'm sorry.

42:27.851 --> 42:31.010
I wanted to be here, but this man
came in with a knife...

42:31.216 --> 42:32.772
Jackie, I'm talking to you!

42:32.983 --> 42:36.072
She's at that "not talking" stage.

42:36.281 --> 42:37.973
Now trust me on this one, okay?

42:38.180 --> 42:42.577
Just finish cleaning up, give it
a couple of days, and I'll talk to her.

43:03.801 --> 43:05.460
Got stuck in surgery?

43:08.599 --> 43:11.496
I couldn't be at
my mother's birthday party...

43:12.997 --> 43:17.893
...because I had to save a man with
"Die, nigger, die" tattooed on his arm.

43:28.923 --> 43:30.444
That's my husband.

43:45.415 --> 43:46.574
Good night.

44:00.808 --> 44:03.170
Susan. Susan!

44:03.640 --> 44:05.037
Dr. Lewis!

44:05.439 --> 44:07.029
Rene's back.

44:11.536 --> 44:15.796
Pulse 50. BP 80 over 60.
Respiration's 14.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.988
Rene. Rene, what are you on?

44:19.300 --> 44:21.764
Mr. Franks, what'd she take?
What'd she take?

44:21.965 --> 44:24.021
I don't know.
I found her in the bathroom.

44:24.230 --> 44:25.627
- Where's her boyfriend?
- I don't know.

44:25.830 --> 44:27.954
All right. On three, bring it up.

44:28.595 --> 44:30.856
One, two, three.

44:31.260 --> 44:33.157
Get a tox screen and BA.

44:34.559 --> 44:36.683
No gag, let's intubate. Come on.

44:38.157 --> 44:41.815
Rene, we haven't lost anyone today.

44:42.022 --> 44:44.214
We are not starting with you.

44:46.053 --> 44:47.609
Prep for lavage.

44:55.982 --> 44:59.639
Rene, you are not going to die tonight.
You hear me? Not tonight!

44:59.880 --> 45:01.470
Get the charcoal!
