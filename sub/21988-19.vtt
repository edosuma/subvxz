00:05.744 --> 00:07.007
JAVIER:
Ball up, boys.

00:27.592 --> 00:29.768
Sí.

00:29.812 --> 00:30.639
How's that for...

00:32.423 --> 00:35.252
Oh, d-damn!

00:36.862 --> 00:38.386
Good thing I won.

00:43.173 --> 00:45.175
♪

01:19.166 --> 01:20.384
You coming?

01:20.428 --> 01:22.082
Eh, it depends.

01:22.125 --> 01:23.866
There any more dead bodies
about to fall on our heads?

01:23.909 --> 01:26.129
McGEE: No, coast is clear.BISHOP: Good.

01:26.173 --> 01:28.262
Because I can't take any
more drama for the day.

01:28.305 --> 01:30.133
Drama

01:30.177 --> 01:33.484
Oh, that stupid hipster
barista at Joe's Coffeehouse

01:33.528 --> 01:34.877
called me "ma'am."

01:34.920 --> 01:38.010
I mean, do I look like
a "ma'am" to you?

01:38.054 --> 01:39.708
Hey, you have bigger
problems on your hands.

01:40.578 --> 01:41.971
Abby's looking for you.

01:42.014 --> 01:43.494
And I think she knows.

01:43.538 --> 01:45.453
Knows what?

01:45.496 --> 01:48.978
That it was you who blew up
her mass spec last week?

01:49.021 --> 01:51.676
Ooh, I wouldn't have got out
of bed this morning, ma'am.

01:51.720 --> 01:55.332
It was Jimmy's idea
to hotwire her lab, not mine.

01:55.376 --> 01:57.378
Yeah. That's not
the story he's telling.

01:57.421 --> 02:00.163
There is no way she
knows. Gibbs told me

02:00.207 --> 02:01.904
he was gonna tell her that
the mass spec was broken

02:01.947 --> 02:03.775
by the bad guys in
the attack. Okay...

02:03.819 --> 02:05.690
Right, Gibbs?Nope.

02:05.734 --> 02:07.431
I thought you said
you were gonna...

02:07.475 --> 02:08.998
Lie to Abby?

02:09.041 --> 02:10.652
H-Ha... No.

02:10.695 --> 02:12.436
But by "no," I mean "yeah."

02:12.480 --> 02:14.438
Sounds like you two had
a misunderstanding.

02:14.482 --> 02:16.136
TORRES: Look, guys, if
she hasn't figured it out,

02:16.179 --> 02:17.789
oh, she will.

02:17.833 --> 02:20.314
Maybe she won't.McGEE:
Right,

02:20.357 --> 02:22.446
because figuring stuff out
isn't her strong suit.

02:22.490 --> 02:23.926
Are you done?

02:23.969 --> 02:25.493
'Cause we got a body.

02:25.536 --> 02:28.235
Actually, we got two.

02:28.278 --> 02:29.149
Grabbing our gear.

02:33.501 --> 02:35.938
Jesse Banks,

02:35.981 --> 02:37.592
32, owns the record store.

02:37.635 --> 02:39.333
Cleaning lady found him
this morning.

02:39.376 --> 02:42.205
And according to his military
I.D., our second victim

02:42.249 --> 02:44.729
is Lance Corporal Oliver Harris.

02:44.773 --> 02:46.340
Where's he stationed?

02:46.383 --> 02:47.515
Uh, don't know.

02:47.558 --> 02:49.604
Running a search
in the NLAV database.

02:49.647 --> 02:52.172
Oh, wow.
Yummy Chummy Gummy Bunny.

02:52.215 --> 02:53.825
I used to listen to this

02:53.869 --> 02:55.523
all the time as a kid.
It's about a little bunny

02:55.566 --> 02:56.741
who lived
in a tree house,

02:56.785 --> 02:58.221
and he used to...Solve crimes?

02:58.265 --> 03:00.441
No, no, no, he had a--
he had this band.

03:00.484 --> 03:02.312
And look at this,
the carrot was a drummer;

03:02.356 --> 03:03.487
the turnip was a singer.

03:03.531 --> 03:05.794
And they used to...Solve crimes.

03:05.837 --> 03:08.013
Yes, it was a crime-solving
bunny, boss.

03:08.057 --> 03:10.799
Sorry I'm late.
What'd I miss?

03:10.842 --> 03:12.627
Just McGee's sad childhood.

03:17.458 --> 03:20.635
JIMMY: Well, looks like
he's not the only one.

03:20.678 --> 03:21.984
Look at the scarring
on this guy.

03:22.027 --> 03:24.813
Some of these are pretty old.

03:24.856 --> 03:25.988
Gang tats.

03:26.031 --> 03:27.511
Uh, Gibbs, we got a problem.

03:27.555 --> 03:29.687
NLAV search is done,

03:29.731 --> 03:33.474
but I can't find any record
of Lance Corporal Oliver Harris.

03:33.517 --> 03:35.258
Well, that's impossible.
If he's not in the database,

03:35.302 --> 03:36.433
he's not in the military.

03:36.477 --> 03:38.740
How'd he get a military I.D.?

03:39.697 --> 03:41.395
TORRES:
He made it.

03:41.438 --> 03:44.267
And something tells me
he made a lot more.

03:44.311 --> 03:45.399
McGEE:
Uh, boss,

03:45.442 --> 03:46.661
these I.D.s give
the holder access

03:46.704 --> 03:48.967
to any military base
in the country.

03:49.011 --> 03:51.796
In the world, McGee.

04:00.762 --> 04:02.807
McGEE: Victim number one,
you've already met,

04:02.851 --> 04:05.245
Jesse Banks.In addition to owning
a record store,

04:05.288 --> 04:06.594
he has also had quite a few

04:06.637 --> 04:08.857
profitable side gigs.Ticket scalping,

04:08.900 --> 04:10.032
bank fraud,

04:10.075 --> 04:11.381
and his specialty is in...

04:11.425 --> 04:12.774
Making fake I.D.s.

04:12.817 --> 04:13.992
Good guess.

04:14.036 --> 04:15.255
Which is where
we're assuming

04:15.298 --> 04:16.821
victim number two
got this.

04:16.865 --> 04:18.040
BISHOP:
We pulled his prints.

04:18.083 --> 04:19.346
His real name is Daniel Lucas,

04:19.389 --> 04:21.304
and that fake I.D.
is the closest

04:21.348 --> 04:24.525
he has ever come to being
a part of the armed forces.

04:24.568 --> 04:27.615
But he was a member of a gang
called La Vida Mala.

04:27.658 --> 04:29.225
BISHOP:
They deal drugs,

04:29.269 --> 04:30.792
run guns,
and they hire themselves

04:30.835 --> 04:32.228
out as hit men.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.752
Started out as a small
street gang, but they've grown.

04:34.796 --> 04:37.059
Over 10,000 members across
15 different states.

04:37.102 --> 04:39.496
Yeah, I know who they are.

04:40.497 --> 04:42.412
We've met.

04:42.456 --> 04:43.761
What do you think
they're up to, boss?

04:43.805 --> 04:45.894
I think we need
to find out, fast.

04:45.937 --> 04:47.809
Bishop, talk to Abby.

04:47.852 --> 04:49.811
Find out what she's got.

04:49.854 --> 04:53.336
And Agent Bishop was
never heard from again.

04:53.380 --> 04:54.555
What?

04:54.598 --> 04:56.165
What's that supposed to mean?

04:56.208 --> 04:57.297
Well, I'm sure
Abby's figured out

04:57.340 --> 04:58.733
who killed her mass spec by now.

04:58.776 --> 05:00.735
Okay, guys.

05:00.778 --> 05:02.389
The joke's over.

05:02.432 --> 05:04.826
Ha, ha.

05:05.914 --> 05:07.350
I'm gonna miss her.

05:07.394 --> 05:08.482
Yeah.

05:08.525 --> 05:10.745
BISHOP:
Hey, Abbs.

05:10.788 --> 05:11.876
What do you got?

05:11.920 --> 05:14.183
I've got a mystery on top

05:14.226 --> 05:15.793
of a conundrum that's wrapped up
in a-a riddle.

05:15.837 --> 05:17.273
Hmm.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.797
I'm doing post mortem
on Major Mass Spec,

05:19.841 --> 05:21.364
and nothing's adding up.

05:21.408 --> 05:22.974
Really. Like what?

05:23.018 --> 05:24.759
Well, in your
after-action report,

05:24.802 --> 05:27.544
you said that
Major Mass Spec was damaged

05:27.588 --> 05:30.373
when the bad guys blew up
the power grid last week.

05:30.417 --> 05:31.896
Yeah. That's what happened.

05:31.940 --> 05:34.464
But there's no other damage
to this fuse,

05:34.508 --> 05:38.338
so the power surge had
to come from someplace else.

05:38.381 --> 05:39.469
Hmm.

05:39.513 --> 05:40.601
I know.

05:40.644 --> 05:42.385
I am hurting, too.

05:42.429 --> 05:44.387
But don't worry,
I'm doing

05:44.431 --> 05:47.303
full diagnostics,
and... whatever happened,

05:47.347 --> 05:49.131
I will get to the bottom of it.

05:49.174 --> 05:50.741
Awesome.

05:50.785 --> 05:52.395
Well, I'll tell you
what is awesome.

05:52.439 --> 05:56.007
I finished processing
the I.D. printer

05:56.051 --> 05:57.487
from the crime scene.

05:57.531 --> 05:59.402
I would guess that
Jesse Banks probably made,

05:59.446 --> 06:01.448
like, 500 I.D.s with it.

06:01.491 --> 06:02.666
Any way to tell for who?

06:02.710 --> 06:04.842
No. With an asterisk.

06:04.886 --> 06:06.453
May I draw
your attention

06:06.496 --> 06:07.323
to this?

06:07.367 --> 06:08.933
It's the color ribbon.

06:08.977 --> 06:10.805
It's what's used
to transfer

06:10.848 --> 06:14.112
the I.D. picture
onto the actual I.D. itself.

06:14.156 --> 06:16.158
So you were able
to scan the ribbon,

06:16.201 --> 06:18.116
and pull the last I.D. printed.

06:18.160 --> 06:19.291
You know me so well.

06:19.335 --> 06:20.684
You got a name?

06:23.557 --> 06:25.646
ABBY:
Marine Sergeant...

06:26.473 --> 06:28.518
...Rico Ruiz.

06:28.562 --> 06:30.433
Any way to tell
if he's ever used his I.D.?

06:30.477 --> 06:33.480
Yeah, the DoD has a master
registry that logs every time

06:33.523 --> 06:35.525
an I.D. is scanned on a base.

06:35.569 --> 06:38.398
In this case... whoa.

06:38.441 --> 06:41.923
It was five minutes ago at the
Joint Base Hanover commissary.

06:43.490 --> 06:45.840
Thanks.

06:47.668 --> 06:49.887
Uh, no sign of Ruiz, but we're
gonna take a look around.

06:49.931 --> 06:51.411
BISHOP:
Copy that.

06:51.454 --> 06:52.847
We're gonna head
over to base security.

06:52.890 --> 06:54.326
All right.

06:55.502 --> 06:56.981
Excuse me.

06:57.025 --> 06:58.243
NCIS.

06:58.287 --> 06:59.984
Congratulations.

07:00.028 --> 07:01.943
Looking for this man.
Have you seen him?

07:01.986 --> 07:04.162
No.

07:04.206 --> 07:07.165
Well, he scanned his C.A.C.
at your terminal 45 minutes ago.

07:07.209 --> 07:09.864
Sorry, I haven't really been
able to focus.

07:09.907 --> 07:10.995
Hey!

07:11.039 --> 07:12.083
Water cup, kids.

07:12.127 --> 07:13.781
That's a watercup.

07:13.824 --> 07:14.825
Agua.

07:14.869 --> 07:15.783
No soda.

07:15.826 --> 07:17.524
Every frickin' day.

07:17.567 --> 07:19.569
If it's not a ten-year-old,
it's a general.

07:19.613 --> 07:22.093
Can you look again?

07:22.137 --> 07:23.399
Yeah.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.836
On second thought,
the-the haircut

07:25.880 --> 07:27.534
and the cammies do
look familiar.

07:27.577 --> 07:29.536
I think I've seen
him in here, like,

07:29.579 --> 07:31.451
1,500 times today? Hey!

07:31.494 --> 07:33.975
Put the straws back.

07:34.018 --> 07:35.193
Tomás!

07:35.237 --> 07:36.630
Sit down. Siéntete.

07:36.673 --> 07:38.022
Sorry about that.

07:38.066 --> 07:39.894
You're looking for
that guy, talk to her.

07:39.937 --> 07:41.591
She's been here over an hour,

07:41.635 --> 07:44.072
notmanaging those children.

07:44.115 --> 07:45.552
McGEE:
All right, thanks.

07:45.595 --> 07:47.902
Um...

07:47.945 --> 07:49.599
Excuse me, ma'am?

07:49.643 --> 07:51.253
Uh, sorry, miss.

07:51.296 --> 07:53.429
Have you seen this man?

07:53.473 --> 07:55.387
Uh...

07:55.431 --> 07:56.606
I couldn't say.

07:56.650 --> 07:58.434
Ten kids, two eyes.

07:58.478 --> 07:59.609
Can we ask the children,

07:59.653 --> 08:01.437
or do we need permission
from the parents?

08:01.481 --> 08:03.439
Uh, there are no parents.

08:03.483 --> 08:06.529
¿Alguien ha visto a este hombre?

08:06.573 --> 08:07.530
Mm-mm. No.

08:07.574 --> 08:09.663
Are they orphans, or...?

08:09.706 --> 08:11.099
Unaccompanied minors.

08:11.142 --> 08:12.753
At least,
that's the term du jour.

08:12.796 --> 08:14.494
Refugees.

08:14.537 --> 08:16.321
Yeah. They fled
from countries overwhelmed

08:16.365 --> 08:17.627
by gang violence.

08:17.671 --> 08:19.107
Mostly
Central America.

08:19.150 --> 08:23.590
Some came alone, some came
with their parents, but...

08:23.633 --> 08:25.374
Some of the parents
didn't make it.

08:25.417 --> 08:26.549
It's not
an easy trip.

08:26.593 --> 08:28.333
Let's just
put it that way.

08:28.377 --> 08:30.684
And with so many orphaned
children pouring in,

08:30.727 --> 08:33.034
Health and Human Services'
housing is at capacity.

08:33.077 --> 08:35.732
So you're using the military
bases as an overflow.

08:35.776 --> 08:37.212
Yeah. At least,
while their cases

08:37.255 --> 08:38.605
are working
through the courts, yeah.

08:40.607 --> 08:41.564
Oh, you're in luck.

08:41.608 --> 08:43.566
He's seen him.

08:43.610 --> 08:45.002
He said
he was taking pictures.

08:46.613 --> 08:48.005
Taking pictures of what?

08:48.049 --> 08:49.267
Well, the kids didn't know.

08:49.311 --> 08:50.921
And we never found Ruiz.

08:50.965 --> 08:53.271
But we did pick him up
on some base security cameras.

08:54.664 --> 08:56.231
Ruiz took photos

08:56.274 --> 08:58.015
for over an hour before
he got to the commissary.

08:58.059 --> 09:00.670
VANCE:
Looks like he's doing recon.

09:00.714 --> 09:02.716
Recon for what?Well,

09:02.759 --> 09:04.239
if he's La Vida Mala,
probably not

09:04.282 --> 09:06.284
their office party.

09:06.328 --> 09:07.503
Could be some kind of attack.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.070
You need to find this guy.

09:09.113 --> 09:11.681
Well, I was able to pull
the cell's IMEI number.

09:11.725 --> 09:15.119
It's registered to our
gangbanger down in autopsy.

09:15.163 --> 09:16.947
Can you use that to locate
our live one?

09:16.991 --> 09:19.602
Well, Ruiz turned off
cell location services,

09:19.646 --> 09:21.691
but I was able to access
the cloud backup.

09:21.735 --> 09:22.910
Which means?

09:22.953 --> 09:24.433
We got his photos.

09:31.614 --> 09:33.268
So what's the target, Gibbs?

09:33.311 --> 09:35.618
This seems like just
a bunch of random photos.

09:35.662 --> 09:37.707
No, it's not random.

09:39.753 --> 09:40.710
Keep going.

09:43.539 --> 09:45.149
Right there.

09:45.193 --> 09:46.673
He's after the kids?

09:46.716 --> 09:48.631
No. Just one of them.

09:53.767 --> 09:54.637
That girl...

09:56.204 --> 09:58.467
...is La Vida Mala's target.

10:06.344 --> 10:08.695
The kids should be back soon.
We can wait here.

10:08.738 --> 10:09.870
This is where they live?

10:09.913 --> 10:12.263
KELLY:
I know. But believe it or not,

10:12.307 --> 10:13.874
it's an improvement
from their lives before.

10:13.917 --> 10:16.572
Oh. School's out.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.661
School?Of course.

10:18.705 --> 10:20.532
What'd you think
we do with them?I-I guess I...

10:20.576 --> 10:23.535
I didn't really think about it.

10:23.579 --> 10:26.495
So did you want to talk
to all the kids, or-or just...

10:26.538 --> 10:27.583
BISHOP:
Just her.

10:27.627 --> 10:28.976
KELLY:
Sure. That's Elena.

10:33.676 --> 10:35.330
Hi.

10:44.339 --> 10:46.297
That's a first.

10:46.341 --> 10:48.778
Elena isn't a big fan
of strangers.

10:53.522 --> 10:55.350
Mi mamá.

10:56.743 --> 10:59.833
KELLY: Elena grew up in
the slums of San Salvador.

10:59.876 --> 11:02.096
When the gang violence
escalated,

11:02.139 --> 11:04.664
she and her mother were forced
to flee for their lives.

11:04.707 --> 11:06.709
Only Elena
survived the trip.

11:06.753 --> 11:08.885
When the authorities
found their boat,

11:08.929 --> 11:10.582
she was clinging
to her mother's body.

11:14.021 --> 11:15.631
What about
her father?

11:15.675 --> 11:18.416
Dead. Long time ago.

11:18.460 --> 11:20.767
She's had a rough life.

11:20.810 --> 11:22.769
And it's such a shame.
She's a special girl.

11:22.812 --> 11:26.642
Big heart,
smart as a whip.

11:26.686 --> 11:29.558
What's gonna happen to her?

11:29.601 --> 11:31.734
Same thing that's gonna
happen to most of them.

11:31.778 --> 11:35.390
They'll be deported.
Sent back.

11:45.748 --> 11:47.750
No?

11:49.796 --> 11:51.101
KELLY:
Is that all?

11:51.145 --> 11:52.537
GIBBS:
Yeah, for now.

11:52.581 --> 11:53.800
Gonna have to put
a couple of guards

11:53.843 --> 11:55.323
at that door
in the meantime.

11:55.366 --> 11:57.238
Uh, th-there is no meantime.

11:57.281 --> 11:59.022
She's scheduled
to be transferred tomorrow.

11:59.066 --> 12:01.764
What

12:01.808 --> 12:03.635
Uh, to another temporary shelter
closer to the courts

12:03.679 --> 12:05.681
that'll be handling her case.
North Dakota, I think.

12:07.248 --> 12:10.207
Yeah, well,
that's not gonna work.

12:10.251 --> 12:12.340
All right, so Ruiz was
taking pictures on the base,

12:12.383 --> 12:14.559
but what was
this guy doing there?

12:14.603 --> 12:16.126
We have to search his home.

12:16.170 --> 12:19.782
We need to find his home.
DMV address is fake.

12:19.826 --> 12:21.566
He must live somewhere.

12:21.610 --> 12:24.831
And they're back,
and with company.

12:24.874 --> 12:26.571
Protective custody.

12:26.615 --> 12:29.270
Until we find out why
La Vida Mala was following her.

12:29.313 --> 12:30.750
Hi, sweetheart.

12:30.793 --> 12:32.447
What's your name?

12:32.490 --> 12:33.970
She doesn't speak English.

12:34.014 --> 12:35.972
Oh, well, then that
would be a job for me.

12:36.016 --> 12:37.365
Mis amigos.

12:37.408 --> 12:38.758
If anyone is
gonna translate,

12:38.801 --> 12:40.368
it should be someone who
speaks her native language.

12:40.411 --> 12:43.153
Hola. Me llamoNicholas.

12:47.984 --> 12:51.640
¿Por qué tu camisa
es tan apretada?

12:53.773 --> 12:55.035
What'd she say?

12:55.078 --> 12:57.428
She wants to know why
his shirt's so tight.

12:57.472 --> 12:59.561
Don't we all.All right, Bishop.

13:03.913 --> 13:06.176
You know, maybe she meant
"tight," like...

13:06.220 --> 13:07.830
like one of those comic book
heroes, like...

13:07.874 --> 13:09.658
You know?We got any leads
on our fake sergeant?

13:09.701 --> 13:12.443
I checked with
Metro's Gang Division.

13:12.487 --> 13:14.576
They have definitely
seen him before.

13:15.925 --> 13:18.188
Who's he with?Javier Martinez.

13:18.232 --> 13:20.582
He's the leader of the
La Vida Mala on the East Coast.

13:20.625 --> 13:23.193
He's also suspected
of over 20 murders.

13:23.237 --> 13:24.804
What's he doing walking around?

13:24.847 --> 13:27.154
No one's willing to
testify against him.

13:27.197 --> 13:29.504
But he definitely knows
how to find our guy.

13:29.547 --> 13:32.289
Then we need to find him.
I just spoke to

13:32.333 --> 13:34.291
the commandant at Hanover.
We got a problem.

13:34.335 --> 13:35.945
Same day Ruiz
was on base,

13:35.989 --> 13:39.557
three crates of rocket-propelled
grenade launchers went missing.

13:39.601 --> 13:42.125
Yeah, that's a problem.

13:42.169 --> 13:44.519
La Vida Mala
is arming themselves.

13:44.562 --> 13:45.781
For what?

13:48.740 --> 13:51.439
And it wasn't until 1921

13:51.482 --> 13:53.049
that the United States
put a restriction

13:53.093 --> 13:55.269
on the amount of immigrants
that were allowed to...

13:55.312 --> 13:58.838
well, immigrate, I guess.
Or is it emigrate?

13:58.881 --> 14:00.883
DUCKY:
Immigrate.

14:00.927 --> 14:02.493
:
Please tell me you heard that.

14:02.537 --> 14:04.408
He's dead, Dr. Palmer.

14:04.452 --> 14:07.585
Yeah, I noticed
when I removed his spleen

14:07.629 --> 14:09.196
and he didn't complain.

14:10.240 --> 14:11.763
How long have you been watching?

14:11.807 --> 14:15.332
Long enough to hear your story
about the Irish Potato Famine.

14:15.376 --> 14:18.074
How-how does this,
uh, work, Dr. Mallard?

14:18.118 --> 14:19.467
Where have you gone?

14:19.510 --> 14:22.905
You can just buzz into Autopsy
whenever you like?

14:22.949 --> 14:26.387
Oh, Kasie set it up for me
when she and I were there.

14:26.430 --> 14:27.910
In case I...

14:27.954 --> 14:32.088
Well, let's just say,
there's no place like home.

14:32.132 --> 14:33.916
Well,

14:33.960 --> 14:36.049
I could actually use
a consult on the current case.

14:36.092 --> 14:37.615
Fire away.

14:37.659 --> 14:40.531
Well, we have two victims,

14:40.575 --> 14:43.578
both with multiple blunt force
traumas, each with abrasions

14:43.621 --> 14:46.450
that perfectly match the other's
metacarpophalangeal joints.

14:46.494 --> 14:49.497
In other words, they beat
the crap out of each other.

14:49.540 --> 14:51.586
Um, yeah, you could say that.

14:51.629 --> 14:53.022
Yeah, so what's the problem?

14:53.066 --> 14:55.938
Well, take a look at this.

14:58.158 --> 15:02.553
His gums have nearly
receded into oblivion.

15:02.597 --> 15:04.599
And his teeth are transparent.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.951
Not to mention, they don't seem

15:08.995 --> 15:11.258
particularly connected
to his mouth anymore.

15:11.301 --> 15:13.825
Well, that is interesting.

15:13.869 --> 15:15.740
You ever seen anything
like this before?

15:15.784 --> 15:19.222
Translucent teeth? No.

15:19.266 --> 15:21.790
I may have to clear
my schedule for today.

15:24.880 --> 15:27.578
Uh, we're almost
settled here.

15:27.622 --> 15:31.582
I have never seen a little girl
eat quite so many burgers.

15:31.626 --> 15:34.585
Oh, and I just watched
Gibbs make a bed.

15:34.629 --> 15:36.065
Yeah, that was weird.

15:36.109 --> 15:39.590
Uh, shoot. I got to go.
Hey.

15:39.634 --> 15:42.071
Careful with that. Cuidado.GIBBS: No, she's good.

15:42.115 --> 15:44.073
She looks like she knows
how to handle herself.

15:46.684 --> 15:48.643
Está bien.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.254
What about McGee?

15:51.298 --> 15:54.866
Uh...

15:54.910 --> 15:56.868
He said Hanover called.

15:56.912 --> 16:00.263
Um, they discovered a lot
more missing weapons

16:00.307 --> 16:01.525
than just those RPGs.

16:01.569 --> 16:04.572
So what about Elena?

16:04.615 --> 16:05.965
You want me to take
the first shift?

16:06.008 --> 16:07.923
No, I got it.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.099
Okay.

16:14.930 --> 16:16.149
Let me do that.

16:16.192 --> 16:19.500
You're not strong enough.Yes, I am.

16:22.590 --> 16:25.158
You, uh, speak English
pretty good.

16:25.201 --> 16:27.508
How did you know?

16:27.551 --> 16:30.119
The way your eyes
popped out of your head

16:30.163 --> 16:32.643
when Bishop said she was gonna
go out and get cheeseburgers.

16:35.168 --> 16:36.473
Where'd you learn
how to use a chisel?

16:36.517 --> 16:39.694
Mi papá.

16:39.737 --> 16:42.523
He was a carpenter.

16:42.566 --> 16:46.570
Mamátold me he made this
for me when I was little.

16:46.614 --> 16:48.703
It broke.

16:48.746 --> 16:50.922
It doesn't play music anymore.

16:50.966 --> 16:54.926
How long am I
going to stay here?

16:54.970 --> 16:58.408
Why? Someplace else
you got to be?

16:58.452 --> 17:01.629
School.

17:01.672 --> 17:03.326
You like school?

17:03.370 --> 17:05.763
I have never been.

17:09.680 --> 17:13.728
Well, somebody did a good job
teaching you English.

17:13.771 --> 17:15.599
Mi mamá.

17:18.080 --> 17:20.474
Hey, McGee,
what do you got?

17:20.517 --> 17:22.302
We got a lead
on one of the victims.

17:22.345 --> 17:24.086
He was a bleachorexic.Jimmy, hang on.

17:24.130 --> 17:27.089
That's why his teeth kept
falling out, overbleached 'em.

17:27.133 --> 17:28.612
And I care about this why?

17:28.656 --> 17:31.528
Well, it's something we should
all be aware of, Gibbs.

17:31.572 --> 17:32.747
I mean, overbleaching
can cause...

17:32.790 --> 17:34.096
Is this going someplace, Palmer?

17:34.140 --> 17:36.707
Abby traced the type of bleach

17:36.751 --> 17:38.709
Lucas used to
a home bleaching kit

17:38.753 --> 17:40.755
that's available only by mail.

17:40.798 --> 17:41.886
JIMMY:
We contacted the company.

17:41.930 --> 17:43.758
They were able to
look up Lucas's order.

17:43.801 --> 17:45.586
You got an address.

17:51.853 --> 17:55.335
If I was a gangbanger looking to
store a bunch of stolen weapons,

17:55.378 --> 17:56.771
this would
be the spot.

17:57.641 --> 17:59.556
REEVES:
Tire tracks. Fresh.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.645
We just missed somebody.

18:01.689 --> 18:04.779
Maybe not.

18:25.278 --> 18:27.671
You cool, bro?

18:27.715 --> 18:29.630
Yeah, I'm right as rain, bro!

18:34.722 --> 18:35.679
On second thought,
shoot him!

18:35.723 --> 18:37.507
Shoot him!

18:44.079 --> 18:46.951
Right as rain?Yeah, had him right
where I wanted him.

18:48.736 --> 18:52.000
Is that before or after
your head went through the...

18:53.219 --> 18:54.916
REEVES:
Is that a body?

19:04.055 --> 19:06.319
That's three.

19:16.459 --> 19:18.505
Hey.Hey.

19:18.548 --> 19:21.899
You know where I can score
some crime scene photos?

19:21.943 --> 19:23.466
I heard you hit the mother lode.

19:23.510 --> 19:25.425
Yes.

19:25.468 --> 19:28.515
Wow. These are fantastic.

19:28.558 --> 19:30.473
Do we have a motive?

19:30.517 --> 19:34.347
Well, the guy that Torres
knocked out isn't talking,

19:34.390 --> 19:35.739
but his cell phone is.

19:35.783 --> 19:38.394
And guess who his favorite
texting buddy is.
Who?

19:38.438 --> 19:39.961
Javier Martinez.

19:40.004 --> 19:41.789
The leader of La Vida Mala?

19:41.832 --> 19:43.704
Yep.

19:43.747 --> 19:46.228
He looks more like my mattress
salesman than a gang leader.

19:46.272 --> 19:48.970
You have your own
mattress salesman?
Yep.

19:49.013 --> 19:51.146
JAVIER: Before we begin,
I just want to let you know

19:51.190 --> 19:53.931
that I am a big fan
of law enforcement.

19:53.975 --> 19:56.760
Mm

19:56.804 --> 19:58.675
So how may I help you?

19:58.719 --> 20:02.331
Well, Javi,

20:02.375 --> 20:04.333
where do you want to start?

20:04.377 --> 20:07.336
How 'bout we start
with the bodies

20:07.380 --> 20:09.338
we found in your stash house.

20:09.382 --> 20:10.948
Stash house?

20:10.992 --> 20:13.299
Or, if you wanted to,

20:13.342 --> 20:17.346
we could start with the bodies
we found at the record store.

20:18.652 --> 20:22.308
Records? Who buys
records these days?

20:22.351 --> 20:25.136
Or we could start
with the high-powered weapons

20:25.180 --> 20:28.662
your crew stole
from one of our military bases.

20:31.404 --> 20:34.189
I haven't the foggiest idea
what you're talking about.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.757
What was one of your goons doing

20:36.800 --> 20:39.281
taking pictures of that kid?

20:39.325 --> 20:40.891
What?

20:40.935 --> 20:43.285
You recruiting
ten

20:43.329 --> 20:46.636
A-Agent Gibbs, I'm a simple man

20:46.680 --> 20:48.421
that lives a simple life.

20:48.464 --> 20:52.033
I don't know anything
about any dead bodies.

20:52.076 --> 20:53.817
I mean,
God rest their souls.

20:53.861 --> 20:56.820
I-I don't know anything
about any stolen weapons.

20:56.864 --> 20:58.953
And I certainly
don't know anything

20:58.996 --> 21:01.825
about any ten-year-old girl.

21:01.869 --> 21:04.567
Boom.
Aha.

21:04.611 --> 21:06.613
I never said it was a girl.

21:10.312 --> 21:11.835
You think you know me, huh?

21:11.879 --> 21:13.489
Mm-hmm.

21:13.533 --> 21:16.623
You don't. None of you do.

21:16.666 --> 21:18.886
Living in your ivory towers

21:18.929 --> 21:21.454
with your two parents,

21:21.497 --> 21:23.673
your two cars,
food on the table.

21:23.717 --> 21:26.110
Wake up, man.

21:26.154 --> 21:31.072
The rest of us are either eating
or are getting eaten.

21:31.115 --> 21:34.075
You see, I have

21:34.118 --> 21:36.991
spent my entire life

21:37.034 --> 21:40.560
around men like you, judging me.

21:40.603 --> 21:42.997
You got something on me?

21:43.040 --> 21:44.999
Then arrest me.

21:46.653 --> 21:48.611
Yeah, that's right.

21:48.655 --> 21:51.179
You got nothing
and you never will.

21:51.222 --> 21:56.184
You're dancing with the devil,
my friend.

21:56.227 --> 21:59.666
You have no idea
what we're capable of.

21:59.709 --> 22:03.713
And anyone that
gets in our way,

22:03.757 --> 22:06.629
even a little girl...

22:06.673 --> 22:08.892
is gonna pay.

22:08.936 --> 22:13.114
What they're capable of?

22:13.157 --> 22:14.724
What are they planning?

22:14.768 --> 22:16.900
And how is Elena
gonna get in the way?

22:16.944 --> 22:18.424
Maybe she knows something.

22:18.467 --> 22:20.295
Well, wouldn't
she have told us?

22:20.339 --> 22:24.038
Maybe she doesn't even know
what she knows.

22:24.081 --> 22:27.389
SLOANE: Okay,
turn your whole body into it.

22:29.609 --> 22:31.828
Oh, man!
Yes!

22:31.872 --> 22:33.613
Great shot.

22:33.656 --> 22:35.571
Don't forget
to follow through.

22:35.615 --> 22:37.747
But I got you here.

22:41.185 --> 22:42.926
Come on!
Yes!

22:42.970 --> 22:44.580
Again.

22:44.624 --> 22:46.713
Are you sure you haven't
played this before?

22:46.756 --> 22:48.497
Don't answer that.

22:48.541 --> 22:50.673
I don't want to know.

22:50.717 --> 22:52.414
You want to know something.

22:52.458 --> 22:54.590
That's why I'm here, no?

22:54.634 --> 22:56.636
You are a very smart
little girl, aren't you?

22:59.073 --> 23:02.206
Ah, ah. Only one
per win, remember?

23:02.250 --> 23:06.689
But I already told Agent Gibbs
all that I know.

23:08.778 --> 23:11.607
So you never heard anyone
from La Vida Mala

23:11.651 --> 23:13.174
talking about any attacks?

23:15.263 --> 23:16.743
But you do know them?

23:16.786 --> 23:19.789
Everyone does where I come from.

23:19.833 --> 23:23.358
That's why your mama tried to
get you out of the country, huh?

23:23.402 --> 23:26.405
She said they brought the guns

23:26.448 --> 23:28.102
and the guns brought the death.

23:29.843 --> 23:31.627
And the cavidades.

23:31.671 --> 23:33.629
Ca... cavities?

23:33.673 --> 23:34.935
Like...

23:34.978 --> 23:37.546
Cavidades.

23:37.590 --> 23:39.069
Hey.
Hey.

23:39.113 --> 23:40.201
Where's Elena?

23:40.244 --> 23:42.682
With Vance. Everybody...

23:42.725 --> 23:44.248
I think I know

23:44.292 --> 23:46.033
what La Vida Mala is doing

23:46.076 --> 23:47.077
with the stolen weapons.

23:47.121 --> 23:48.339
Selling them.

23:48.383 --> 23:50.646
To who?
Not who.

23:50.690 --> 23:51.865
Where.

23:51.908 --> 23:54.476
Elena told me that once a month,

23:54.520 --> 23:56.565
a "big truck" would come

23:56.609 --> 23:58.915
into her village
filled with ice cream

23:58.959 --> 24:02.179
and La Vida Mala would give
it all away to the kids.

24:02.223 --> 24:04.747
Okay, that still doesn't make
any connections for me.

24:04.791 --> 24:06.270
BISHOP: Yeah, I don't think
she's done yet.

24:06.314 --> 24:07.533
SLOANE: Well, after
the truck would come,

24:07.576 --> 24:08.882
Elena said

24:08.925 --> 24:11.711
the violence would follow.
She and her friends

24:11.754 --> 24:13.495
were too young to
make the connection,

24:13.539 --> 24:14.888
but I think...

24:14.931 --> 24:17.064
La Vida Mala was using
the ice cream company

24:17.107 --> 24:18.587
to smuggle in weapons.

24:18.631 --> 24:20.763
Exactly.She remembered the name?

24:20.807 --> 24:22.548
What kid would forget
free ice cream?

24:22.591 --> 24:24.811
Moochie's Creamery.

24:26.943 --> 24:28.510
McGEE: All right.
Here it is.

24:28.554 --> 24:30.512
Moochie's Creamery.

24:30.556 --> 24:31.818
Based in Delaware

24:31.861 --> 24:33.297
and they ship
internationally.

24:33.341 --> 24:34.690
And they have
a warehouse not far

24:34.734 --> 24:35.691
from where the
weapons were stolen.

24:35.735 --> 24:36.692
Got it.

24:36.736 --> 24:38.868
Rule Number 39:
no coincidences.

24:38.912 --> 24:41.262
Wait. You know the rules?

24:41.305 --> 24:43.264
Uh, figured it was mandatory?

24:44.483 --> 24:46.963
Come on, let's move.

24:47.007 --> 24:49.400
Oh, uh, boss,
we may have a problem.

24:49.444 --> 24:51.794
The motion sensor I installed
on your front door

24:51.838 --> 24:53.883
just went off. Somebody could
be trying to break in.

24:53.927 --> 24:56.886
My what on my what?

24:56.930 --> 24:59.062
Well, the... I-I...

24:59.106 --> 25:00.499
put the...

25:00.542 --> 25:02.065
your... the...

25:02.109 --> 25:03.850
I thought it'd be
a good idea

25:03.893 --> 25:06.809
with Elena in custody
and everything, to put a...

25:06.853 --> 25:08.419
Okay, in hindsight,
I probably should've asked

25:08.463 --> 25:09.551
about it first.

25:09.595 --> 25:10.857
Bishop.

25:10.900 --> 25:12.815
Ice cream company.
Take Reeves.

25:12.859 --> 25:14.034
Torres.

25:14.077 --> 25:15.035
Peeping Tim.

25:15.078 --> 25:16.123
On my six.

25:16.166 --> 25:17.428
We'll talk in the car.

25:17.472 --> 25:18.865
Hey, for the record...

25:20.910 --> 25:22.869
...you are smarter than that.

25:43.585 --> 25:45.544
♪

26:11.004 --> 26:12.048
Clear.
Clear.

26:13.876 --> 26:15.878
Bag this.

26:17.880 --> 26:19.795
Whoever was here
already left.

26:19.839 --> 26:21.797
Not whoever.
It was Ruiz.

26:21.841 --> 26:23.016
Your neighbor
identified him.

26:23.059 --> 26:24.800
Which neighbor?

26:24.844 --> 26:25.975
The one you like.

26:26.019 --> 26:27.977
What the hell was Ruiz
doing in your house?

26:28.021 --> 26:29.588
They were after the girl.

26:29.631 --> 26:31.459
He's been watching us.

26:33.069 --> 26:34.157
BISHOP:
We got the weapons.

26:34.201 --> 26:35.811
It's Bishop.
She found the weapons.

26:38.248 --> 26:39.641
Oh, that's great.

26:39.685 --> 26:40.947
When did you realize
he had something?

26:40.990 --> 26:42.862
The manager at the
ice cream company

26:42.905 --> 26:44.777
started acting squirrelly the
moment we pulled our badges.

26:44.820 --> 26:46.343
We asked to see what
was inside the truck

26:46.387 --> 26:47.693
and he said it was empty,

26:47.736 --> 26:49.956
but I could smell
the rocky road.

26:49.999 --> 26:52.132
Uh, I did more than smell.

26:52.175 --> 26:53.742
I need an intervention.

26:53.786 --> 26:55.396
Stop me.

26:55.439 --> 26:57.920
Wait, so the weapons were hidden
inside the rocky road?

26:57.964 --> 27:00.009
Well, no, that would be
really messy.

27:00.053 --> 27:02.011
You would be
a terrible smuggler.

27:02.055 --> 27:03.839
You have to think
outside the box.

27:03.883 --> 27:06.407
Or in this case,
inside the box.

27:07.930 --> 27:12.413
And... just add water.

27:15.634 --> 27:16.983
Huh.

27:17.026 --> 27:19.681
Your gun smugglers disassembled
the stolen weapons

27:19.725 --> 27:22.728
and then hid them inside
these pallets of dry ice.

27:22.771 --> 27:24.991
So, all they had to do when
they reached their destination

27:25.034 --> 27:26.296
was turn off the AC.

27:26.340 --> 27:27.907
And...

27:27.950 --> 27:30.039
voilà.

27:31.693 --> 27:34.391
Hey, is this some kind
of detonator?

27:34.435 --> 27:35.610
ABBY:
No.

27:35.654 --> 27:38.134
That is my
la-door keypad.

27:38.178 --> 27:41.834
I-I found the source
of the power surge

27:41.877 --> 27:44.706
that killed Major Mass Spec.

27:44.750 --> 27:45.838
Traced it back
to that pad.

27:45.881 --> 27:47.709
So it's only
a matter of time

27:47.753 --> 27:50.973
before I figure out
who the murderer is.

27:51.017 --> 27:53.106
Awesome.

27:53.149 --> 27:55.325
So, how many RPGs
did you find?

27:55.369 --> 27:58.024
There's about 20 more
in those containers.

27:58.067 --> 27:59.808
Oh, that's a lot
of firepower.

27:59.852 --> 28:03.333
Well, yeah,
if they actually fired.

28:03.377 --> 28:04.683
Every single one of these

28:04.726 --> 28:06.249
has had their spring coil
snipped.

28:06.293 --> 28:08.077
They're disabled, permanently.

28:08.121 --> 28:09.078
By who?

28:09.122 --> 28:10.732
Well, that's the best part.

28:10.776 --> 28:12.560
I was able to pull fingerprints

28:12.603 --> 28:13.996
off the inside
of the launch tubes.

28:14.040 --> 28:16.956
Our RPG snipper is
none other than...

28:19.480 --> 28:21.090
Him again.

28:21.134 --> 28:23.832
Why go to the trouble
to steal the weapons

28:23.876 --> 28:26.139
just to disable them?

28:37.193 --> 28:38.804
Well, Abby confirmed it.

28:38.847 --> 28:41.850
Every single weapon's
been disabled.She sure Ruiz did it?

28:41.894 --> 28:44.766
She said she would bet
her dog collar on it.

28:44.810 --> 28:46.637
It doesn't make any sense.
What would La Vida Mala

28:46.681 --> 28:48.161
want with weapons
that don't fire?

28:48.204 --> 28:49.597
You asking me?

28:49.640 --> 28:51.164
Go find the guy
who did it.

28:51.207 --> 28:52.687
Still nothing on the BOLO.

28:52.731 --> 28:54.602
Well, ATF has the ice cream
company on lockdown,

28:54.645 --> 28:55.821
said nobody's talking.

28:55.864 --> 28:57.779
They're all
scared of Javier.

28:57.823 --> 28:59.389
Well, we could give it a try.

28:59.433 --> 29:03.002
Yeah, yeah, do it and then
check in with Palmer.

29:03.045 --> 29:05.831
Oh, I hope you guys
are going out for burgers.

29:05.874 --> 29:07.397
It's way past dinnertime...

29:07.441 --> 29:08.877
...and I have one hungry
little girl here.

29:08.921 --> 29:10.009
And a sleepy one.

29:10.052 --> 29:11.662
We doing burgers again?

29:11.706 --> 29:13.664
I like burgers.

29:13.708 --> 29:14.796
:
Really?

29:14.840 --> 29:16.842
I had not noticed.

29:22.673 --> 29:24.197
Elena?

29:24.240 --> 29:29.680
I think... I think he was there.

29:29.724 --> 29:31.552
Uh, where, Elena?

29:31.595 --> 29:34.468
Back home.

29:36.513 --> 29:39.038
He is the ice cream man.

29:39.081 --> 29:42.693
Shipping company.
Check and see if Ruiz

29:42.737 --> 29:44.695
was ever a driver.

29:44.739 --> 29:47.437
Hey, honey.

29:47.481 --> 29:49.265
What do you remember?

29:51.702 --> 29:54.270
Something bad.

29:56.055 --> 29:58.535
Take your time.

29:58.579 --> 30:01.669
He had long hair.

30:01.712 --> 30:03.497
He scared me.

30:03.540 --> 30:06.282
I was crying.

30:06.326 --> 30:09.938
And then I ran away and hid.

30:12.593 --> 30:14.595
That is all I remember.

30:14.638 --> 30:16.510
SLOANE:
It's okay.

30:17.728 --> 30:19.818
It's okay, honey.

30:22.908 --> 30:25.780
SLOANE: Hiya. We got
the ice cream company

30:25.824 --> 30:27.564
shipping records.

30:27.608 --> 30:29.523
And I stopped
to get some burgers

30:29.566 --> 30:31.699
just in case you guys
haven't eaten,

30:31.742 --> 30:33.657
which it looks like you have.

30:35.834 --> 30:37.792
This is my second.

30:37.836 --> 30:39.489
And Elena?

30:39.533 --> 30:40.882
Oh, man.

30:40.926 --> 30:44.886
She absolutely
crushed four.

30:44.930 --> 30:47.758
I mean, that girl could eat.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.981
Burger coma.

31:04.863 --> 31:06.952
I'm sure it must be hard
having another little girl

31:06.995 --> 31:08.910
back in here, huh?

31:08.954 --> 31:12.871
You must have some
good memories, though, Gibbs.

31:17.049 --> 31:18.920
Anyway...

31:18.964 --> 31:21.444
Bishop and I went through

31:21.488 --> 31:23.751
Moochie's Creamery's
employee files.

31:23.794 --> 31:25.057
There's no record

31:25.100 --> 31:27.450
of a Rico Ruiz
ever driving for them.

31:27.494 --> 31:29.844
Who knows if that's
even his real name.

31:29.888 --> 31:31.933
And they didn't recognize
his picture.

31:31.977 --> 31:34.544
So we got nothing.

31:34.588 --> 31:36.068
And no leads.

31:36.111 --> 31:38.113
He could be halfway
across the world by now.

31:38.157 --> 31:40.159
He's not.

31:40.202 --> 31:42.770
How can you be so sure?

31:42.813 --> 31:44.685
ELENA:
Because of me.

31:46.034 --> 31:48.950
Huh?

31:48.994 --> 31:51.822
He is after me, yes?

31:51.866 --> 31:53.781
Um...

31:53.824 --> 31:55.261
What makes you say that?

31:56.958 --> 31:59.221
Isn't that why I'm here?

31:59.265 --> 32:02.921
Because he wants to hurt me.

32:02.964 --> 32:04.923
We don't know what he wants.

32:04.966 --> 32:06.489
I do.

32:08.665 --> 32:12.365
I think he wants
to punish me for what I did.

32:12.408 --> 32:14.845
What are you talking
about, sweetheart?

32:14.889 --> 32:18.110
When our boat sunk,

32:18.153 --> 32:21.548
Mamágave me
her lifejacket.

32:21.591 --> 32:24.855
We only had one.

32:24.899 --> 32:28.250
I told her to keep it.

32:28.294 --> 32:30.861
She could just hold me.

32:30.905 --> 32:34.300
But she wouldn't listen.

32:34.343 --> 32:37.825
It's my fault she's dead.

32:37.868 --> 32:39.087
No.

32:39.131 --> 32:42.351
Not your fault.

32:42.395 --> 32:44.745
None of this is your fault.

32:44.788 --> 32:47.139
No, it sure isn't.

32:47.182 --> 32:49.141
Your mama did what mamas do.

32:49.184 --> 32:51.795
She protected you.

32:51.839 --> 32:52.840
Okay?

32:52.883 --> 32:55.364
We're gonna protect you, too.

32:55.408 --> 32:58.063
No one's gonna hurt you.

32:59.281 --> 33:01.544
We won't let anyone hurt you.

33:01.588 --> 33:03.546
:
That's right.

33:03.590 --> 33:06.941
Can we have hamburgers
for breakfast?

33:06.985 --> 33:08.595
Uh...Yes.

33:08.638 --> 33:10.640
Uh-huh.Works for me.

33:12.077 --> 33:13.948
GIBBS:
Hey.

33:13.992 --> 33:15.297
That you?

33:15.341 --> 33:17.647
Nope.

33:20.085 --> 33:21.521
DUCKY:
Well, hiding bodies

33:21.564 --> 33:23.740
in the structural cavities
of buildings

33:23.784 --> 33:25.873
has a long and storied history.

33:25.916 --> 33:27.875
In fact, Agent McGee...What's going on?

33:27.918 --> 33:30.312
I consulted briefly
with Dr. Mallard yesterday

33:30.356 --> 33:33.576
on the case,
and since then, he's...

33:33.620 --> 33:35.926
let's just say he has
immersed himself in things.

33:35.970 --> 33:37.189
Oh.

33:37.232 --> 33:38.886
Like a houseguest
that won't leave.

33:38.929 --> 33:40.018
Yeah.

33:40.061 --> 33:41.280
Or a fungus that, uh...

33:41.323 --> 33:42.846
Yeah, I got it.Yeah, you got it.

33:42.890 --> 33:43.978
I got it.

33:44.022 --> 33:46.589
Ah, Timothy.

33:46.633 --> 33:47.982
We were just talking about you.

33:48.026 --> 33:51.029
What brings you to Autopsy
at this late hour?

33:51.072 --> 33:53.031
Well, uh, Gibbs wants an update.

33:53.074 --> 33:56.077
Ah. Dr. Palmer,
it's your autopsy.

33:56.121 --> 33:57.035
Oh. Uh, y-yes.

33:57.078 --> 33:59.037
Okay. Thank you, Doctor. Um...

33:59.080 --> 34:01.082
Well, all three victims appear
to have been killed recently.

34:01.126 --> 34:03.041
I'd say in the last two days...

34:03.084 --> 34:04.259
Give or take.

34:04.303 --> 34:06.870
No, I'm gonna
stick with two days.

34:06.914 --> 34:09.308
Uh, death
was from hypovolemic shock...

34:09.351 --> 34:11.223
Yeah. They bled to death.

34:11.266 --> 34:13.834
...as the result
of shrapnel wounds

34:13.877 --> 34:16.010
consistent with an RPG that...

34:16.054 --> 34:18.012
Exploded in their hands.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.535
Doctor, maybe it's time

34:19.579 --> 34:20.928
that we establish
some ground rules...

34:20.971 --> 34:22.103
for how...
Wait, Jimmy,

34:22.147 --> 34:23.452
did you say "RPG"?

34:23.496 --> 34:25.976
Well, Abby believes
it was stolen.

34:26.020 --> 34:27.108
I mean, she said

34:27.152 --> 34:28.718
those weapons were disabled.

34:28.762 --> 34:32.026
Yes, but she suspects
that these men were attempting

34:32.070 --> 34:33.506
to re-enable them.

34:34.768 --> 34:36.117
U-Um, Dr. Palmer,

34:36.161 --> 34:37.031
if you...

34:38.815 --> 34:40.295
Call him back later.

34:40.339 --> 34:43.342
We found this embedded
in one of the victims.

34:43.385 --> 34:45.344
It must have flown off
the weapon when it exploded.

34:45.387 --> 34:46.649
What is it?

34:46.693 --> 34:48.086
It appears to be an attempt

34:48.129 --> 34:50.000
to replace
that missing spring coil.

34:50.044 --> 34:54.004
Wait, so the bad guys steal
the weapons, break the weapons

34:54.048 --> 34:55.658
and then, fix the weapons?

34:55.702 --> 34:59.140
Maybe some
very indecisive bad guys?

34:59.184 --> 35:01.055
Or we're missing something.

35:03.188 --> 35:04.189
Boss, hey.

35:04.232 --> 35:05.625
I just talked to...GIBBS: Stop.

35:05.668 --> 35:06.974
Get over here.Right now?

35:07.017 --> 35:08.018
Yeah.Okay, you got it.

35:08.062 --> 35:09.194
Be right there.

35:09.237 --> 35:10.456
What's going on?

35:10.499 --> 35:12.588
All hands on deck.

35:12.632 --> 35:14.155
All right.

35:14.199 --> 35:17.898
Go get those
indecisive bad guys.

35:37.700 --> 35:39.093
NCIS.

35:39.137 --> 35:40.312
Don't move.

35:40.355 --> 35:42.357
Boo.

35:44.794 --> 35:47.362
Hot tip: next time
you decide to break into a house

35:47.406 --> 35:48.711
and crack open a window,

35:48.755 --> 35:50.800
make sure the owner
likes fresh air.

35:50.844 --> 35:53.455
I haven't opened
that puppy since '04.

35:53.499 --> 35:54.935
Where's Elena?

35:54.978 --> 35:56.328
Safe.

35:56.371 --> 35:58.504
She's at a place
where you can't hurt her.

35:58.547 --> 36:01.594
Why on earth
would I hurt my own daughter?

36:03.073 --> 36:05.206
Your daughter?

36:07.991 --> 36:10.342
RUIZ:
I'm not a terrorist.

36:10.385 --> 36:13.736
I'm certainly not
a member of any gang.

36:13.780 --> 36:16.304
I'm a carpenter.

36:16.348 --> 36:18.263
Me, too.

36:18.306 --> 36:23.006
Six years ago, my wife left me.

36:23.050 --> 36:25.618
It's the the last time
I saw my daughter.

36:25.661 --> 36:27.707
What were you
doing on that base?

36:27.750 --> 36:31.145
What I had to.

36:31.189 --> 36:34.583
I originally came to send
money back to Elena.

36:34.627 --> 36:37.456
If I couldn't see her,
at least I could

36:37.499 --> 36:40.894
help get her out of the slum,
you know, someplace safe.

36:40.937 --> 36:44.245
Then, every place became unsafe.

36:44.289 --> 36:47.074
La Vida Mala.

36:47.117 --> 36:51.121
I heard Elena's mom
tried to get her out, but, um...

36:56.083 --> 36:59.521
I was on that base to get
my daughter, Agent Gibbs.

36:59.565 --> 37:01.871
Before they sent her back.

37:01.915 --> 37:04.091
There are forms
you could've filled out.

37:04.134 --> 37:06.702
Not for me.

37:06.746 --> 37:09.488
I set one foot in that
immigration office,

37:09.531 --> 37:13.231
I get arrested, and they deport
us both back to El Salvador.

37:13.274 --> 37:15.233
Back to La Vida Mala.

37:15.276 --> 37:17.104
It's a death sentence.

37:17.147 --> 37:20.238
Yeah, but you were
working with them.

37:20.281 --> 37:23.241
Like I said,
I did what I had to do.

37:23.284 --> 37:26.113
They're the ones
who helped me get on the base.

37:26.156 --> 37:28.115
What did you do for them?

37:28.158 --> 37:29.986
I drove a truck.

37:30.030 --> 37:32.119
I picked it up
in an alley in D.C.,

37:32.162 --> 37:34.643
drove it to another alley
in Virginia.

37:34.687 --> 37:37.994
A truck full of stolen weapons.

37:38.038 --> 37:39.431
Yes.

37:39.474 --> 37:41.824
Weapons I made sure
would never hurt anybody.

37:44.218 --> 37:45.393
But Javier found out

37:45.437 --> 37:47.308
I messed with
his toys.

37:48.570 --> 37:50.529
He killed the men
who vouched for me,

37:50.572 --> 37:53.401
and he put a hit
on me and my daughter.

37:54.402 --> 37:56.404
Javier...

37:58.493 --> 38:01.061
...Martinez?

38:03.193 --> 38:05.239
Gracias.

38:07.285 --> 38:08.590
There he is.

38:08.634 --> 38:11.332
Just a simple man,

38:11.376 --> 38:13.378
living a simple life.

38:13.421 --> 38:14.901
Do you mind?

38:14.944 --> 38:17.295
I'm trying to pay
my last respects.

38:17.338 --> 38:18.644
To the man you killed?

38:18.687 --> 38:20.210
Wow, that's edgy.

38:20.254 --> 38:22.517
So you boys are here
to harass me, huh?

38:24.737 --> 38:26.129
Well, get in line.

38:26.173 --> 38:28.610
It's like a bunch of hungry pigs

38:28.654 --> 38:31.309
at a trough.

38:31.352 --> 38:33.311
Trying to get a bite.

38:33.354 --> 38:35.138
But you're all gonna
go home hungry, huh?

38:36.401 --> 38:37.315
Excuse me.

38:37.358 --> 38:38.925
Not this time.

38:40.535 --> 38:42.276
McGEE:
Oh, look at that.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.409
Someone who's willing
to testify against you.

38:47.237 --> 38:49.022
I guess it's time
for us pigs to eat.

38:53.983 --> 38:56.203
McGEE: Well, between
two counts of murder

38:56.246 --> 38:58.161
and conspiracy
to commit, I'd say

38:58.205 --> 38:59.728
we've seen the last of this guy.

38:59.772 --> 39:01.469
What about Rico?

39:01.513 --> 39:03.036
Well, that's more complicated.

39:03.079 --> 39:04.298
He has no legal status,

39:04.342 --> 39:05.908
but he is a witness
in a murder trial.

39:05.952 --> 39:07.345
He's also a hero.

39:07.388 --> 39:09.390
Who falsified
government documents.

39:09.434 --> 39:11.784
He risked his life
to disable those weapons.

39:11.827 --> 39:13.046
Like I said,

39:13.089 --> 39:14.352
it's complicated.

39:28.453 --> 39:30.411
It just needed a little oil.

39:39.855 --> 39:41.422
Look at her.

39:41.466 --> 39:43.163
♪

39:43.206 --> 39:46.732
Agent Gibbs said
she thought I was dead.

She knows the truth now.

39:50.083 --> 39:54.392
Well, I, for one,
am gonna miss the hamburgers.

40:01.311 --> 40:03.792
Okay.

40:13.019 --> 40:14.803
Hello, Elena.

Do you remember this day?

40:49.795 --> 40:52.450
It's the last time
we saw each other.

40:54.800 --> 40:57.237
It's the same day
I gave you that.

And you told me
you had to go away.

41:31.967 --> 41:34.666
Yes.

41:34.709 --> 41:36.450
I ran, and I hid.

41:36.494 --> 41:38.496
Yes. A-And I searched
for you for two hours.

41:38.539 --> 41:40.846
Papá.

41:44.458 --> 41:46.721
My baby.

Everything okay, boss?

42:02.563 --> 42:05.087
No.

What happens now?

42:09.091 --> 42:12.312
ELENA :
Papá.
