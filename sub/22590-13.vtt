00:11.095 --> 00:15.266
<i>NARRATOR". Nothing has changed with the
weather in the great metropolis of Londinium.</i>

00:15.433 --> 00:18.019
<i>It's still clear as glass.</i>

00:18.186 --> 00:21.814
<i>But at least the Dynamic Duo
are out of the fog in the winch room.</i>

00:21.981 --> 00:25.276
<i>And the mist
seems to have missed the Batmobile.</i>

00:25.443 --> 00:28.279
Thank heavens, Robin.
I despaired of ever seeing you again.

00:28.446 --> 00:30.114
The despair was mutual, Alfred.

00:30.281 --> 00:33.785
I think we better get out to Ffogg Place
and see what's happened to Batgirl.

00:33.952 --> 00:35.453
- Batgirl?
-Yes.

00:35.620 --> 00:39.958
Alfred heard that she discovered
a super-secret Cricket Pavilion...

00:40.124 --> 00:43.127
...which just might contain the solution
to this entire mystery.

00:43.294 --> 00:45.588
She has and it does.

00:45.838 --> 00:49.634
You two seem to know a lot more
about Batgirl than I do.

00:49.801 --> 00:54.472
She's in the dungeon at Ffogg Place beneath
the gallery off the super-secret Cricket Pavilion.

00:54.639 --> 00:58.101
I would be too if Lord Ffogg hadn't
wanted me to wind up in the winch room.

00:58.268 --> 01:01.312
- We better get there on the double.
-If I may, sir, my cab.

01:01.980 --> 01:05.191
- Your cab?
-I borrowed one from my cousin Cuthbert...

01:05.358 --> 01:07.110
...to get around a bit, you know?

01:07.277 --> 01:09.153
It's parked in the dock area.

01:09.320 --> 01:11.531
Yes, of course, I remember.

01:11.823 --> 01:14.325
Better still, Robin, you drive the Batmobile.

01:14.492 --> 01:18.162
Let us off at Alfred's cab,
go straight to Ffogg Place, and we'll follow.

01:18.329 --> 01:22.166
You bet, Batman. If we disassemble,
maybe we can catch the whole gang off guard.

01:22.333 --> 01:24.836
And don't forget to drive
on the left, not the right.

01:25.003 --> 01:26.254
I won't, Batman.

01:26.421 --> 01:29.382
I learned that when
we got our international driver's licenses.

01:29.549 --> 01:30.717
Good.

01:36.472 --> 01:37.932
Batman.

01:42.895 --> 01:45.523
<i>NARRATOR".
Meanwhile in the dungeon at Ffogg Place...</i>

01:45.690 --> 01:50.528
<i>...Batgirl seems to have survived
Lord Ffogg's paralyzing gas.</i>

01:50.695 --> 01:52.655
<i>But what next?</i>

01:54.866 --> 01:58.536
So young, so pretty, such joie de vivre.

01:58.703 --> 01:59.829
Yes, Marmaduke.

01:59.996 --> 02:03.541
It seems a pity
that we have to dispose of her, doesn't it?

02:03.708 --> 02:05.126
But dispose of her we must.

02:05.293 --> 02:08.211
With Batman and Robin fogbound
in the Tower Bridge...

02:08.378 --> 02:10.465
...we can now plan our crowning theft.

02:10.632 --> 02:13.259
- The Crown Jewels.
-The Crown Jewels?

02:13.426 --> 02:16.721
- She heard you, Marmaduke.
-It matters little, sister dear.

02:16.888 --> 02:19.390
Somehow Batman has managed
to regain his memory.

02:19.557 --> 02:22.560
But death will prevent Batgirl
from regaining hers...

02:22.727 --> 02:26.731
...when I toss these lethal fog pellets
from the steps.

02:26.898 --> 02:30.068
- Toodle-oo.
-And chin-chin.

<i>NARRATOR". And soon,
hard by the gates of Ffogg Place...</i>

05:05.640 --> 05:09.227
What's that? The blooming Boy Wonder
climbed over the main gates?

05:09.393 --> 05:12.063
Hold your places. I'll handle this.

05:12.230 --> 05:13.564
Did you hear that, Penelope?

05:13.731 --> 05:15.733
Robin is on the grounds someplace.

05:15.900 --> 05:18.528
We must act covertly to trap him.

05:18.694 --> 05:22.156
Well, why don't we have
Lady Prudence act covertly?

05:22.323 --> 05:27.245
Lady Prudence.
Splendid, my dear, splendid.

05:42.510 --> 05:44.846
Smashing, Robin.

05:45.012 --> 05:48.850
You've tripped the wire
leading to His Lordship's beehive.

05:49.475 --> 05:51.853
And released an African death bee.

05:52.019 --> 05:53.271
The queen, in fact.

05:55.731 --> 05:57.650
She's landing on your hand, Robin.

06:00.361 --> 06:01.946
Don't lose your cool.

06:20.339 --> 06:21.382
Tempted, sir?

06:22.341 --> 06:24.176
Sorely, Alfred.

06:24.510 --> 06:27.972
By opening this suitcase,
I might learn Batgirl's true identity.

06:28.139 --> 06:31.475
And thus destroy the anonymity
so precious to her.

06:31.642 --> 06:32.894
As yours is to you, sir.

06:35.146 --> 06:36.689
I know, Alfred.

06:36.856 --> 06:39.525
You go back to the city
while I infiltrate Ffogg Place...

06:39.692 --> 06:41.319
...and try to find her and Robin.

06:41.485 --> 06:45.114
Alert Commissioner Gordon and
venerable Ireland Yard as to my whereabouts.

06:45.281 --> 06:47.325
Tell them I'll be in touch if I need help.

06:47.491 --> 06:49.243
Cheerio.

07:20.733 --> 07:22.777
She won't leave.

07:22.944 --> 07:24.862
She may.

07:25.196 --> 07:28.783
But once a death bee lands,
she usually stays a while.

07:30.076 --> 07:32.954
Or she may sting you, Robin, and you'll die.

07:39.794 --> 07:43.172
All the other girls are
out of their skin over you.

07:43.381 --> 07:45.383
I can see why, Robin.

07:45.549 --> 07:48.344
I can see why.

07:56.060 --> 07:57.603
What? Not dead yet?

07:58.020 --> 08:00.398
No, Lord Ffogg, far from it.

08:00.731 --> 08:04.151
My lethal fog pellets must be stale.
They're losing their strength.

08:04.318 --> 08:08.656
Well, I had the girls make up a fresh batch
in chemistry class, Marmaduke.

08:08.823 --> 08:13.077
And I hid them amongst the Duchess
of Desborough's diamonds to be handy.

08:13.244 --> 08:14.412
Let's get them.

08:25.423 --> 08:28.134
But, Marmaduke, hadn't we better hurry?

08:28.300 --> 08:31.387
What with Robin out on the lawn
and Batman coming up the drive.

08:31.554 --> 08:34.724
When the death bee stings Boy Wonder,
he'll be out the lawn forever.

08:34.890 --> 08:37.143
Then Digby, Scudder and Basil
can handle Batman.

08:37.308 --> 08:38.519
Well, they didn't before.

08:38.686 --> 08:41.438
Since that little incident,
I've given them a severe talking to.

08:44.316 --> 08:46.736
What? Batman got away from the terrace?

08:46.902 --> 08:48.779
He's coming here to the Cricket Pavilion?

08:48.946 --> 08:52.283
Basil, you are discharged.

08:55.494 --> 08:57.288
We had better hurry, Penelope.

08:58.456 --> 09:01.083
- Unh.
- Come here, Penelope.

10:08.818 --> 10:11.320
- Batgirl.
-No, Batman, don't come down here.

10:11.487 --> 10:13.447
Look out behind you. Lord Ffogg.

10:17.701 --> 10:20.121
Quick, the pellets, my dear.

10:23.207 --> 10:26.544
I will close and bolt the door
to the dungeon.

10:35.052 --> 10:36.178
What a triumph.

10:36.345 --> 10:37.471
A double triumph.

10:37.638 --> 10:40.641
And the grooviest thing
happened, governor.

10:40.808 --> 10:42.184
What happened?

10:42.351 --> 10:45.855
- The bee stung Robin.
-Ah!

10:46.021 --> 10:49.733
Well, you better take him up
to the girls' dormitory and let him perish there.

10:49.900 --> 10:51.610
And round up the rest of the pupils.

10:51.777 --> 10:56.240
We're off to the Tower of Londinium
and the Crown Jewels.

10:59.994 --> 11:01.912
Why don't I perish here?

11:02.079 --> 11:03.998
It's closer.

11:08.919 --> 11:10.296
<i>NARRATOR".
Courage, Robin.</i>

11:10.462 --> 11:14.008
<i>Seconds away,
Alfred is forcing the gates of Ffogg Place...</i>

11:14.175 --> 11:17.469
<i>...with an unusual show of strength.</i>

11:23.100 --> 11:24.268
<i>What's this?</i>

11:24.435 --> 11:28.230
<i>Another troubled visitor
in venerable Ireland Yard?</i>

11:28.397 --> 11:33.277
I'm sorry to bother you here
in venerable Ireland Yard, commissioner.

11:33.444 --> 11:35.696
Oh, no bother, Mrs. Cooper.
I'm glad you found me.

11:35.863 --> 11:39.617
I'm sure Bruce and Dick
are someplace in Londinium...

11:39.783 --> 11:42.036
...but I haven't been able to locate them.

11:42.203 --> 11:45.539
I'm on my way home
from my North Cape cruise...

11:45.706 --> 11:47.958
...and I hoped to surprise them.

11:48.125 --> 11:51.754
Well, Bruce has been tied up on
Wayne Foundation business since his arrival...

11:51.921 --> 11:56.926
...and young Mr. Dick, I believe, is doing
some research at the various museums.

11:57.092 --> 12:00.137
And we have various, various museums,
Mrs. Cooper.

12:00.304 --> 12:02.056
- Ha-ha-ha.
-Yes, ha, ha.

12:02.806 --> 12:06.393
Well, I thank you both for your time.

12:06.560 --> 12:07.978
It's been a pleasure.

12:08.145 --> 12:09.813
- Oh, commissioner.
-Yes, ma'am?

12:09.980 --> 12:12.024
If you hear from either of them...

12:12.191 --> 12:16.153
...will you please tell them
that I'll be at the Londinium House...

12:16.320 --> 12:19.448
...for another day or so?
-Of course.

12:20.449 --> 12:21.825
It's nice meeting you.

12:21.992 --> 12:24.078
Oh, the pleasure's been all mine.

12:27.998 --> 12:31.710
- Thank you again. Goodbye.
-Goodbye. Ha, ha.

12:32.169 --> 12:33.837
Yeah, delightful lady.

12:34.338 --> 12:36.632
<i>NARRATOR".
While back in the dungeon...</i>

12:36.799 --> 12:39.468
That Anti-Lethal-Fog Batspray
is working, Batman.

12:39.635 --> 12:46.183
Yes, I always carry some in my utility belt
along with a Bat-file.

12:46.350 --> 12:48.936
Now to get to work on those chains.

12:54.692 --> 12:57.861
<i>NARRATOR".
As in the pretty student bodies' dormitory...</i>

12:58.028 --> 12:59.822
You're not dying, Robin.

12:59.989 --> 13:02.574
I was down to my last
African death bee antidote pill...

13:02.741 --> 13:05.202
...but I popped it in my mouth and I'm fine.

13:05.369 --> 13:07.871
- Groovy.
-You're right, Duchess.

13:08.038 --> 13:11.250
Man, I'm ape about you, Robin.

13:11.417 --> 13:13.877
Oh, you're duping my mind.

13:14.044 --> 13:15.254
I'm launched.

13:15.421 --> 13:18.215
Were you ape and launched
when you waylaid me on that dock...

13:18.382 --> 13:20.467
...shanghaied me and brought me back here...

13:20.634 --> 13:23.429
...when you knew I was being tied
to a winch in Tower Bridge?

13:23.595 --> 13:26.557
Merely scholastic exercises, Boy Wonder.

13:26.724 --> 13:29.351
Holy homework.
I'm getting out of here.

13:34.690 --> 13:36.400
Your daughter, commissioner?

13:36.567 --> 13:39.903
No, she's not here.
She left earlier this afternoon.

13:40.070 --> 13:41.947
Left? For where?

13:42.114 --> 13:44.158
I don't know. We were out.

13:44.325 --> 13:47.369
That's very unlike Barbara,
not getting in touch with me.

13:47.536 --> 13:49.455
I'm coming over there at once.

13:49.872 --> 13:51.915
Oh, certainly, commissioner.

13:52.082 --> 13:54.251
He's coming out here at once, Marmaduke.

13:54.418 --> 13:57.921
At once? With Londinium traffic
the way it is in the late afternoon...

13:58.088 --> 13:59.590
...it will be an hour at least.

14:00.007 --> 14:03.260
I don't see why the girls are not--
It was your idea, my sweet.

14:03.427 --> 14:07.264
Yes, but that was before
we decided to fog in on the Crown Jewels.

14:07.556 --> 14:11.268
Tell the girls to bury Robin
where the aftergrass lawn is thickest.

14:11.643 --> 14:14.605
No one will ever find Batman and Batgirl
in that dungeon...

14:14.772 --> 14:18.776
...and we're home free
as soon as we get the Crown Jewels.

14:19.276 --> 14:25.407
I have a strange feeling that the authorities are
beginning to get suspicious of us, Marmaduke.

14:25.574 --> 14:29.119
Getting suspicious of us is one thing,
getting us is another.

14:29.286 --> 14:31.789
Our private plane
is being refueled right now.

14:31.955 --> 14:36.001
And Argentuela has no extradition treaty
with this country.

14:38.962 --> 14:40.589
Argentuela.

14:40.756 --> 14:44.426
Oh, Marmaduke, I've always wanted to go
to the Southern Hemisphere.

14:44.593 --> 14:46.470
I'll alert the household staff.

14:46.637 --> 14:50.516
- You sacked the household staff.
-I rehired them. They're doctoring their bruises.

14:50.682 --> 14:53.477
- What is it, Lady Prudence?
-Robin got away, governor.

14:53.644 --> 14:56.021
He jumped out of the window
of the girls' dormitory.

14:56.188 --> 14:57.231
- Dead?
-Dead?

14:57.398 --> 14:58.816
He wasn't dead.

14:58.982 --> 15:01.026
He's took some sort of bee-sting pill.

15:01.193 --> 15:02.569
Isn't that the most?

15:02.736 --> 15:06.198
To the Tower of Londinium at once.

15:30.848 --> 15:34.768
Just as I suspected, the dungeon door
is made of solid oak. I can't break through it.

15:34.935 --> 15:37.521
If we could only reach that grating up there.

15:39.815 --> 15:41.024
Your Batarang?

15:41.191 --> 15:42.943
I left it in the Batmobile.

15:43.110 --> 15:45.529
If we only had a length of rope.

15:45.696 --> 15:50.033
Here's some rope, Batman. But how can you
get it to the grating without your Batarang?

15:50.200 --> 15:53.078
By using the old Indian rope trick.
I mastered it years ago.

15:53.245 --> 15:54.830
How can I help?

15:54.997 --> 15:58.709
By standing directly under that grating...

15:58.876 --> 16:02.713
...and concentrating
on the Indian fakir command.

16:06.800 --> 16:09.803
Hindi for "rope stay straight."

16:26.445 --> 16:29.198
Master Robin, I just heard you were dead.

16:29.364 --> 16:31.533
You heard wrong. Uh, wrongly.

16:31.700 --> 16:34.995
I gotta get a message to Commissioner Gordon
at venerable Ireland Yard.

16:35.162 --> 16:39.750
Just what I was attempting to do. Lord Ffogg
is planning to steal the Crown Jewels...

16:39.917 --> 16:41.627
...from the Tower of Londinium.

16:41.793 --> 16:45.130
And Batman and Batgirl
are both in the Ffogg Place dungeon.

16:45.297 --> 16:47.925
I'll get back there.
You get on the Batmobile's Batphone.

16:48.091 --> 16:49.218
Good.

16:54.097 --> 16:58.018
<i>NARRATOR". But Lord Ffogg
and his evil entourage of Londinium ladies...</i>

16:58.185 --> 17:00.771
<i>...are already on their way
to the Tower of Londinium...</i>

17:00.938 --> 17:02.856
<i>...and the Crown Jewels.</i>

17:15.827 --> 17:16.954
It worked.

17:17.119 --> 17:20.582
Yes, there's more to old Indian fakir tricks
than one might suspect.

17:20.749 --> 17:23.544
And concentration
magnified by the power of yoga?

17:23.710 --> 17:26.880
Yes, yes, that's enough talking,
Batgirl. Up you go.

18:06.670 --> 18:08.589
This rope may have saved our lives.

18:09.339 --> 18:12.342
Batman, Batgirl, how did you
get out of that dungeon?

18:15.512 --> 18:16.722
Holy levitation.

18:16.888 --> 18:19.933
- The rope's doing it again.
-Yes, I better reverse the incantation.

18:24.313 --> 18:26.940
Can you conjure up something
to get us to the tower...

18:27.107 --> 18:28.900
...before Lord Ffogg and Lady Peasoup?

18:29.067 --> 18:31.111
They've left to steal the Crown Jewels.

18:31.570 --> 18:33.780
I certainly hope so, Robin.

18:36.658 --> 18:40.203
And so at the famed
Tower of Londinium. ..

18:40.370 --> 18:42.914
<i>...otherwise known as the Bloody Tower...</i>

18:43.081 --> 18:46.168
<i>...where two Beefeaters
and a busbied sentry...</i>

18:46.335 --> 18:50.047
<i>...guard the glass case
containing the Crown Jewels.</i>

18:55.260 --> 18:59.222
A, ha! Here we are, girls, the Crown Jewels.

18:59.389 --> 19:01.099
Aren't they magnificent?

19:01.266 --> 19:04.811
Look at the Star of Africa diamond
in the royal scepter.

19:04.978 --> 19:06.355
Isn't it smashing?

19:06.521 --> 19:09.483
Well, I'm out of my skin
over the Sovereign's Golden Orb.

19:10.859 --> 19:12.402
I'm sorry, but it's past closing.

19:12.903 --> 19:16.740
Past closing?
To me, Lord Ffogg of Ffoggshire?

19:16.907 --> 19:18.241
I'll take that halberd.

19:18.742 --> 19:20.911
But not the Crown Jewels, Lord Ffogg.

19:21.078 --> 19:22.245
Batman and Robin?

19:22.412 --> 19:23.497
How did you get here?

19:23.664 --> 19:26.249
It took a holy incantation.

19:27.250 --> 19:30.504
Basil, Digby, Scudder!

19:31.463 --> 19:33.715
- Oh, we're here, governor.
-Johnny-on-the-spot.

19:33.882 --> 19:35.592
Jolly good timing, what.

19:38.929 --> 19:40.263
Hey-

20:37.112 --> 20:39.030
I think we better split, Lady Peasoup.

20:39.197 --> 20:41.700
Indeed, Prudence.

20:43.285 --> 20:44.327
Batgirl.

20:44.703 --> 20:46.997
"Batgirl?
"Batgirl?

20:54.671 --> 20:57.507
My Pipe of Fog Bat-reverser, Your Lordship.

20:57.674 --> 21:00.343
You'll not catch us flat-footed again.

21:04.097 --> 21:07.476
Well, this is a jolly little beanfest.

21:07.684 --> 21:13.982
Take His Lordship, Her Ladyship
and these girlships to the tombs.

21:15.484 --> 21:18.820
But who's going to look after
our aftergrass, Marmaduke?

21:18.987 --> 21:21.531
Quite so, quite so.

21:33.043 --> 21:35.045
I wish I had time to explain, Robin.

21:35.212 --> 21:37.088
I've been very naughty.

21:37.255 --> 21:41.551
I thought if I could play all sides
against each other, I would come out on top...

21:41.718 --> 21:45.388
...and be Her Ladyship of Ffogg Place alone.

21:46.598 --> 21:48.391
But it didn't work.

21:48.558 --> 21:50.727
No, Lady Prudence, it didn't.

21:51.728 --> 21:53.522
But cheerio.

21:56.316 --> 22:00.070
Well, I think this calls for a cup of char
at venerable Ireland Yard.

22:00.237 --> 22:01.446
Char?

22:01.613 --> 22:04.825
Yes, Robin, a colloquialism for tea.

22:04.991 --> 22:07.369
I think a cup of char
would be most welcome, sir.

22:07.536 --> 22:10.497
It will be our first in Londinium,
as a matter of fact.

22:10.664 --> 22:12.541
Will you join us, Batgirl?

22:12.707 --> 22:14.751
Hm. She's gone.

22:16.002 --> 22:20.090
Batgirl? I just passed her outside in the fog.
She was on her Batgirl Cycle.

22:20.257 --> 22:22.300
Where have you been? I've been so worried.

22:22.467 --> 22:25.053
And what are you doing
in this Bloody Tower?

22:25.220 --> 22:27.264
Bloody Tower is right, Daddy.

22:27.430 --> 22:30.267
I'll explain later, or at least I'll try to.

22:30.433 --> 22:32.227
But look, the Crown Jewels.

22:32.394 --> 22:34.604
Right where they belong, my dear.

22:34.771 --> 22:37.399
Thanks to Batman and Robin.

22:37.566 --> 22:40.110
Pip-pip, chin-chin and toodle-oo.

22:44.948 --> 22:48.869
Yes, sir, we all know how important
international relations are...

22:49.035 --> 22:52.330
...and I'm glad we were able to help
in our small way.

22:52.497 --> 22:55.917
Uh, how's your grandson? Heh.

22:56.084 --> 22:57.252
He is?

22:57.419 --> 22:59.796
Extraordinary. Ha-ha-ha.

23:00.630 --> 23:02.215
He is?

23:02.382 --> 23:04.301
Incredible.

23:04.467 --> 23:06.219
He is?

23:06.386 --> 23:08.847
Amazing.

23:09.306 --> 23:12.142
One second, sir. He's right here.

23:13.476 --> 23:15.478
This is Batman, sir.

23:15.645 --> 23:18.315
A weekend in Texas, sir?

23:18.982 --> 23:21.067
With a barbecue, sir?

23:21.318 --> 23:23.737
And bring the Batmobile, sir?

23:23.904 --> 23:25.947
That's a great honor, sir, but, uh...

23:26.114 --> 23:28.909
I wonder, could Robin and I
take a rain check, sir...

23:29.075 --> 23:30.994
...sometime around Easter?

23:31.870 --> 23:35.332
Oh, of course, sir.
I'm sorry, I completely forgot.

23:35.498 --> 23:37.584
Yes, that's convention time. Mm-hm.

23:37.751 --> 23:40.378
But thank you for calling, sir.

23:43.423 --> 23:46.593
How could you turn down
an invitation like that, Batman?

23:47.010 --> 23:49.638
Oh, I'm sure he has
plenty of problems right now...

23:49.804 --> 23:53.934
...without trying to entertain
average citizens such as Robin and I.

23:54.100 --> 23:56.019
No, we'll just hole up here in Gotham City.

23:57.812 --> 23:58.855
Yes, Bonnie.

23:59.022 --> 24:00.899
<i>I'm sorry to bother you, commissioner...</i>

24:01.066 --> 24:03.610
<i>...but some very feline character
just breezed in here.</i>

24:03.777 --> 24:06.112
Hold it, Bonnie.
Say that again, will you, please?

24:06.279 --> 24:08.531
<i>Some very feline character
just breezed in here...</i>

24:08.698 --> 24:12.285
<i>...and stole all the policewomen 's
new mini-uniforms you were to approve.</i>

24:12.452 --> 24:13.995
Some feline character?

24:14.162 --> 24:15.705
Could it be Catwoman back again?

24:15.872 --> 24:17.207
Let's take a look.

24:17.374 --> 24:19.793
The Caped Crusaders will try
to head her off, Bonnie.

24:20.502 --> 24:21.753
Just one minute, Catwoman.

24:23.838 --> 24:26.466
The nerve of her,
invading police headquarters.

24:26.633 --> 24:30.887
Yes, Robin. Gotham City may be in
for some cataclysmic catastrophes.

24:31.054 --> 24:33.014
<i>NARRATOR".
And how right Batman is.</i>

24:33.181 --> 24:36.059
<i>How catastrophic
are the days and nights to come...</i>

24:36.226 --> 24:38.144
<i>...as you will see in the next episode.</i>
