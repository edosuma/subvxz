They're rebuilding
the Tri-Carrier.

11:42.135 --> 11:44.502
Into what?
(ENGINE ROARING)

11:44.504 --> 11:47.505
DR. OCTOPUS:
Into your worst nightmare.

11:47.507 --> 11:49.641
(CACKLING)

11:52.411 --> 11:53.845
How are you pulling
this off, Ock?

11:53.847 --> 11:55.814
It's 10 steps up
from your usual plan

11:55.816 --> 11:57.716
of trying to trap, hurt,
and generally insult me.

11:57.718 --> 12:00.652
I learned by watching you,
Spider-Man.

12:00.654 --> 12:04.355
You are not the only one
capable of building a team.

12:04.357 --> 12:06.925
You're saying I inspired
this plan of yours?

12:14.567 --> 12:19.003
The greatest enemies
of S.H.I.E.L.D. have
finally joined forces...

12:19.005 --> 12:22.774
Doctor Otto Octavius
and HYDRA.

12:28.881 --> 12:30.014
Zola.

12:30.016 --> 12:31.950
Nicholas Fury.

12:31.952 --> 12:34.886
Your S.H.I.E.L.D.
Tri-Carrier is no more.

12:34.888 --> 12:39.124
We transformed it
into the new home of HYDRA.

12:39.126 --> 12:40.525
Hail HYDRA!

12:40.527 --> 12:41.926
DR. OCTOPUS: Hail HYDRA!
(LAUGHING)

12:41.928 --> 12:44.896
SOLDIERS: Hail HYDRA.

12:44.898 --> 12:47.132
Arnim Zola and Ock
are besties?

12:47.134 --> 12:50.101
Did no one get the memo
this was supposed to be
a perfect day?

12:52.204 --> 12:55.406
ZOLA: Today heralds
our rebirth!

12:55.408 --> 12:57.275
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s
high-tech zeppelin

12:57.277 --> 12:59.978
has become something greater!

13:00.880 --> 13:02.981
You did what

13:02.983 --> 13:04.949
to my Tri-Carrier?

13:04.951 --> 13:06.651
(SCREAMING)

13:09.288 --> 13:10.789
(GRUNTING)

13:17.997 --> 13:20.165
Seriously, guys?
Don't you know never to mess

13:20.167 --> 13:22.667
with a superspy's favorite
hovering boondoggle?

13:23.169 --> 13:25.904
(GRUNTING)

13:25.906 --> 13:27.505
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)

13:27.507 --> 13:30.341
I'll teach you about playing
with other people's toys.

13:30.343 --> 13:33.344
Get them, you fools!

13:33.346 --> 13:35.580
(GRUNTING)

13:36.749 --> 13:38.283
Cho, the last time
we fought Swarm,

13:38.285 --> 13:40.685
you said you were developing
an anti-Swarm
transmitter device.

13:40.687 --> 13:44.689
Tried, but couldn't get
the anti-nanobots to adjust
to the changes in the Swarm.

13:53.999 --> 13:56.301
You think you could use
the digital Spider-Sense
you created

13:56.303 --> 13:58.303
to teach the anti-Swarm
how to react?

13:58.305 --> 14:00.205
Yes! You're a genius!

14:00.207 --> 14:03.708
Well, I'm a genius,
but you're a genius
about my genius.

14:03.710 --> 14:06.377
Okay. You guys are using
a whole lot of words.

14:06.379 --> 14:09.314
Just tell me, can we stop
the Tri-Carrier from changing?

14:09.316 --> 14:11.749
Yes, and maybe
even reverse it!

14:16.322 --> 14:20.325
The only problem,
my lab's probably melted into
a HYDRA armory or something.

14:20.327 --> 14:22.460
We have to get you down
to the Triskelion.

14:22.462 --> 14:24.529
It's still covered
with Goblin Gliders.

14:24.531 --> 14:27.365
I don't know if I can make it
in there, let alone back out.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.334
I can get you
past their defense.

14:29.336 --> 14:31.069
I'll be your blocker, dude.

14:31.071 --> 14:33.738
I made all-state
three years in a row!

14:33.740 --> 14:35.240
(YELLING)

14:37.509 --> 14:39.510
What does that even mean?
(SCREAMING)

14:39.512 --> 14:41.045
Is that sports talk?

14:41.047 --> 14:42.580
(BOTH GRUNTING)

14:42.582 --> 14:45.083
Heads up, Goblins!

14:45.085 --> 14:46.384
(GRUNTING)

14:47.920 --> 14:50.421
Midtown High Varsity rules!

14:50.423 --> 14:53.091
(GRUNTING)

14:53.093 --> 14:57.562
I seem to have touched
a nerve, Nicholas.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.764
I've got a plan.
Follow my lead.

14:59.766 --> 15:01.499
Lead fast.
(GRUNTING)

15:03.535 --> 15:06.371
Time to admit defeat,
Spider-Man.

15:06.373 --> 15:08.473
Is it?
My watch must be off.

15:09.842 --> 15:10.975
(GROWLS)

15:17.750 --> 15:19.083
(YELLS)

15:21.854 --> 15:22.987
(SNARLING)

15:24.189 --> 15:25.590
Fury, now!

15:26.358 --> 15:27.792
(BOTH GRUNTING)

15:28.394 --> 15:31.996
No!

15:32.431 --> 15:34.332
That's enough!

15:38.037 --> 15:39.971
If you two
can't play nicely...

15:50.449 --> 15:53.651
That web fluid will hold them,
but not for long.

15:53.653 --> 15:57.722
How are you, big guy?
Fine. Barely felt that.

15:57.724 --> 15:59.123
Yeah. Sounds like it.

15:59.125 --> 16:02.093
Except I think
your broken ribs
may have broken ribs.

16:02.095 --> 16:02.994
(SCREECHING)

16:04.496 --> 16:06.831
If Cho's transmitter device
is going to work,

16:06.833 --> 16:08.733
then we've got to get topside.

16:08.735 --> 16:10.101
Sorry about this.

16:10.103 --> 16:11.336
(GRUNTS)
(BONES CRACK)

16:11.338 --> 16:12.704
Ah!

16:13.672 --> 16:16.975
No. Leave me, Spider-Man.

16:16.977 --> 16:20.144
Are you kidding?
Who's going to berate me
while I save the day?

16:24.817 --> 16:25.984
(FURY GROANING)

16:27.319 --> 16:30.154
Strap in. It's gonna be
a bumpy ride.

16:30.156 --> 16:32.190
Sorry. Sorry.

16:32.192 --> 16:33.758
Sorry. Sorry.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.693
(GROANING CONTINUES)
Sorry. Sorry.

16:35.695 --> 16:39.063
Sorry. Sorry.
Warned you.

16:47.473 --> 16:48.906
Huh?

17:04.490 --> 17:06.858
Whoa. Whatever architect
designed this

17:06.859 --> 17:08.726
needs some serious therapy.

17:08.728 --> 17:12.063
My Tri-Carrier,
look what they've
done to her.

17:12.065 --> 17:14.232
(GROANS)
"Her?"

17:14.233 --> 17:16.233
You have a more serious
relationship than I thought.

17:16.969 --> 17:18.102
Whoa!

17:19.805 --> 17:24.075
There is nowhere to hide
on my HYDRA island.

17:24.077 --> 17:28.679
Not to brag,
but I designed it myself.

17:28.681 --> 17:30.214
What'd I say?

17:32.251 --> 17:34.886
FURY: Ahhh!
(GRUNTING)

17:40.359 --> 17:42.693
Okay, we might
be totally cornered,

17:42.695 --> 17:44.262
but at least
the view's nice.

17:45.431 --> 17:46.898
(YELLS)

17:48.267 --> 17:49.834
Ahh!
(GRUNTS)

17:54.606 --> 17:58.910
You are at the edge
of defeat, Spider-Man.

17:58.912 --> 18:02.447
The Goblin army
is finishing off your friends.

18:02.449 --> 18:05.049
No one can help you.

18:05.051 --> 18:06.818
Oh, yeah?
What do you call that?

18:09.188 --> 18:12.423
One missile against
my entire island?

18:12.425 --> 18:15.226
Ha-ha! You are a fool.

18:15.228 --> 18:17.662
It's not a missile.
It's much more annoying.

18:18.597 --> 18:20.298
Nova to the rescue!

18:20.300 --> 18:21.933
(GRUNTS)

18:34.613 --> 18:38.116
'Sup, web-head?
Heard you're in trouble,
like always.

18:38.118 --> 18:40.785
Iron Spider said to give you
this blah-blah-nerdinator.

18:42.654 --> 18:44.388
It's the
anti-Swarm transmitter.

18:44.390 --> 18:46.324
Yeah, just like I said.
Set it off.

18:46.326 --> 18:48.259
I gotta get it
to the highest point.

18:48.261 --> 18:50.328
No problemo.
Let's do this.

18:51.230 --> 18:52.897
(GROANING)

18:52.899 --> 18:55.900
No. Fury's injured.
He needs medical help now.

18:55.902 --> 18:58.569
What about you?
You know me.
I've got this.

18:58.571 --> 19:01.239
Right. You always do.

19:01.241 --> 19:02.940
Was that sincerity
or sarcasm?

19:02.942 --> 19:05.743
What do you think?
(GROANS)

19:07.346 --> 19:09.480
That wasn't an answer!

19:09.482 --> 19:11.249
SPIDER-MAN: So today's
had some speed bumps,

19:11.251 --> 19:14.252
but I can still turn it back
into the best day ever.

I've got this covered!

Who's back on top?
This guy.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.374
Ock?

19:36.376 --> 19:38.342
Noble effort, Spider-Man,

19:38.344 --> 19:42.346
but your victory
was short-lived,
as you will be.

19:42.348 --> 19:44.949
