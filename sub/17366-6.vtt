00:12.560 --> 00:14.280
Tonight, Richard wears a towel.

00:14.280 --> 00:17.440
James and I eat some crisps.

00:18.080 --> 00:21.400
And The Fly
is in our reasonably-priced car.

00:27.360 --> 00:28.680
CHEERING

00:28.680 --> 00:31.360
Hello! Hello! Thank you.

00:31.360 --> 00:33.800
Thank you so much.
Thank you very much.

00:33.800 --> 00:38.200
Now, there's a new Ferrari
that has come out

00:38.200 --> 00:43.520
and the obvious person to test it
is, of course, James May,
because he actually owns a Ferrari.

00:43.520 --> 00:45.280
Um...

00:45.280 --> 00:49.320
He does. He doesn't like to tell
people. Oh no, I have,
I just told everyone. OK, anyway.

00:49.320 --> 00:54.960
Because he likes to keep it a
secret, someone else had to do it.

00:56.280 --> 00:59.840
DRAMATIC MUSIC

01:13.720 --> 01:16.000
ENGINE REVS

01:19.200 --> 01:21.040
This is all a bit strange.

01:22.680 --> 01:27.200
Because the 458 has
a paddle-operated gearbox,

01:27.200 --> 01:32.120
someone obviously thought that life
back here would be a bit complicated

01:32.120 --> 01:36.040
if there were traditional indicator
and wiper stalks as well,

01:36.040 --> 01:39.400
so they've got rid of them.

01:39.880 --> 01:42.320
The buttons which control
these things

01:42.320 --> 01:44.360
are now on the steering wheel,

01:44.360 --> 01:48.680
along with other
buttons for the headlights, the
suspension settings, the dim dip,

01:48.680 --> 01:52.920
the sidelights, the traction
control, and the starter motor.

01:55.400 --> 01:58.920
And you don't have to drive very far
to realise the problem this creates.

02:00.640 --> 02:04.360
The thing about a steering wheel is,
it moves.

02:04.360 --> 02:07.080
So none of the buttons are ever
where you left them.

02:07.080 --> 02:12.920
I mean, if I want to turn left now,
I have to push
this one on the right.

02:12.920 --> 02:15.880
There,
that's the left-hand indicator.

02:15.880 --> 02:18.600
And if I want to turn on
the lights...

02:18.600 --> 02:20.320
er...

02:21.520 --> 02:23.640
No, that's not it.

02:23.640 --> 02:27.560
This isn't like driving.
It's like playing Pelmanism.

02:27.560 --> 02:29.160
And there's more.

02:29.160 --> 02:32.000
You see, there are two screens
on either side of the rev counter,

02:32.000 --> 02:34.600
so the one on the left tells
me all sorts of things I'm not

02:34.600 --> 02:42.320
really very interested in
and the one on the right is a
speedo or a satnav screen.

02:42.320 --> 02:45.160
You can't have
both at the same time, so,

02:45.160 --> 02:49.160
you know where you are, you just
don't know how fast you're going.

02:50.560 --> 02:56.280
This is likely to make
life a bit botty-clenching when
you go past a speed camera.

02:57.120 --> 02:59.840
Still, at least when you do,
and they send you a snap,

02:59.840 --> 03:06.400
you'll be able to pin it on the
wall, and that will be nice, because
my God, this car is pretty.

03:08.840 --> 03:11.680
Of course, you probably think
all Ferraris are pretty.

03:11.680 --> 03:17.360
But truth be told, the majority
aren't, not really. Striking, yes.
But pretty?

03:17.360 --> 03:19.360
No.

03:19.360 --> 03:22.080
This one,
for example, is just vulgar.

03:22.080 --> 03:27.080
And even James's Ferrari,
the 430, was a bit wrong.

03:27.080 --> 03:30.520
That smiling front end -
it looked like a simpleton.

03:30.520 --> 03:35.560
It should have been called
the 430 Speciale...Needs.

03:37.600 --> 03:39.280
This, though...

03:39.280 --> 03:44.040
I think this is the first
properly pretty Ferrari
since the 308 came along

03:44.040 --> 03:46.000
back in 1975.

03:48.840 --> 03:54.000
Interestingly, though, Ferrari
say it isn't art.
They say it's science.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.920
For example, they say that when
a wheel is turning,

03:56.920 --> 04:01.120
it forces air to move around in
here, creating a high pressure, so,

04:01.120 --> 04:04.800
they fitted these vents here
which channel air along here,

04:04.800 --> 04:07.840
pushing the car back down again.

04:07.840 --> 04:12.920
They say, too, that these
veins here on the front are forced
down when the car is going quickly

04:12.920 --> 04:19.600
by 20mm and that channels more
air underneath the car, creating
more downforce.

04:20.959 --> 04:26.920
All that may be true, but I still
maintain that those chiselled
front wings, the way they go...

04:26.920 --> 04:31.520
They're like
Kristin Scott Thomas's cheekbones.

04:33.960 --> 04:37.920
And it isn't just looks where
it leaps ahead of the old 430.

04:39.040 --> 04:45.600
That car produced 483 horsepower,
so, of course, you'd expect
this to produce a bit more.

04:45.600 --> 04:47.160
490.

04:47.160 --> 04:50.480
Maybe 495.

04:50.480 --> 04:53.240
But you'd be wrong.

04:55.960 --> 05:01.840
Because this produces
a stratospheric 562 horsepower.

05:04.240 --> 05:07.840
It would be interesting, therefore,
to see how much faster this is

05:07.840 --> 05:10.920
then the now defunct 430,
but there's a problem.

05:10.920 --> 05:13.360
You see, this is James's actual car.

05:13.360 --> 05:17.200
The car in which he keeps a little
brush for cleaning the air vents.

05:17.200 --> 05:22.480
And he said we could borrow it
providing we didn't fiddle with any
of the settings or make it dirty

05:22.480 --> 05:24.320
in any way.

05:26.680 --> 05:30.960
These chocolate bars just go
everywhere.

05:30.960 --> 05:36.000
Um...anyway,
he also said I wasn't to...

05:36.000 --> 05:41.680
drive it quickly. He made me promise
that I wouldn't, for instance,
do a drag race with it and I said,

05:41.680 --> 05:47.880
"James, I give you my word, I will
not drive your car fast at all."

05:50.360 --> 05:52.920
I didn't,
however, say anything about him.

05:56.160 --> 05:59.840
OK, we're both
going to use launch control.

05:59.840 --> 06:05.280
Push that button there.
That absolutely knackers
the clutch in a 430.

06:07.040 --> 06:09.600
It will be OK in this, cos it has
a double-clutch system.

06:11.920 --> 06:15.040
3, 2, 1, go!

06:21.120 --> 06:25.360
Whoa! That is nought to 60
in 3.4 seconds.

06:27.560 --> 06:29.920
James's car is gone!

06:30.480 --> 06:32.320
It's just a humiliation!

06:34.040 --> 06:38.920
4.5 litres of V8 rev to 9,000!

06:46.880 --> 06:49.440
I have no idea how fast
I'm going now.

06:51.080 --> 06:54.560
I just know
I'm somewhere near Guildford.

07:01.040 --> 07:06.320
So, the new car doesn't just
beat the old one, it humiliates it.

07:06.320 --> 07:09.880
Destroys it. Crushes it.

07:09.880 --> 07:14.160
I think if I'd just bought a 430,
I'd be feeling suicidal now.

07:14.160 --> 07:18.920
That sense that you could never
drive it again, that you'd just
look like such an idiot.

07:20.880 --> 07:22.360
Oh.

07:22.360 --> 07:25.360
But now it's time to
answer the big one.

07:25.360 --> 07:28.320
What's the 458 like
as a driver's car?

07:28.320 --> 07:33.600
What's it like when you show that
glorious, finely-boned nose
a whiff of track?

07:35.360 --> 07:38.000
You probably think
it'll be brilliant.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.120
You probably imagine all
Ferraris are magnificent

07:41.120 --> 07:46.680
when you put the hammer down, but
again, the truth is, they aren't.

07:47.960 --> 07:51.840
The 348, for example, felt like
it had tyres made from wood.

07:51.840 --> 07:56.040
The 275 had milk-bottle tops
for brakes.

07:56.040 --> 08:01.200
The engine in an F50 felt like it
was bolted directly to your spine.

08:01.840 --> 08:06.560
And the 400 was simply awful
in every way.

08:09.400 --> 08:11.920
So, the 458, then.

08:13.560 --> 08:15.480
All face and no trousers?

08:17.000 --> 08:18.560
Let's find out.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.400
ENGINE ROARS

08:26.160 --> 08:27.680
Oh, my God!

08:31.120 --> 08:32.960
This is incredible!

08:35.440 --> 08:38.200
It just feels so light.

08:39.640 --> 08:41.320
HE CHORTLES

08:43.440 --> 08:48.480
I've never used a light,
flappy-panel gearbox,
but this is just sensational.

08:51.960 --> 08:54.360
What an astonishing car!

08:55.640 --> 08:59.640
Because the rear of the car
is so planted,

08:59.640 --> 09:07.000
thanks to its new suspension system,
they've been able to fit
super-fast steering.

09:07.520 --> 09:10.000
Bang! The nose just darts in.

09:13.080 --> 09:16.200
Ahhh!

09:16.200 --> 09:18.320
What a machine!

09:21.320 --> 09:23.520
This is beyond anything.

09:25.320 --> 09:27.360
And listen to that noise.

09:27.360 --> 09:28.960
ENGINE ROARS

09:28.960 --> 09:32.280
It sounds like a bear,
a burning bear.

09:39.560 --> 09:46.760
I know this is Â£170,000, and that's
a lot even by Ferrari standards...

09:48.240 --> 09:49.640
..but I don't care.

09:49.640 --> 09:55.160
I don't care about the bonkers dash,
I wouldn't even care if this
thing ate one of my legs.

09:58.040 --> 10:05.880
The 458 is one of the all-time
greats and I promise I'm not
saying that just to upset James.

10:10.800 --> 10:13.920
It really is absolutely,

10:13.920 --> 10:19.600
unbelievably,
mesmerisingly brilliant.

10:23.440 --> 10:24.960
CHEERING

10:28.240 --> 10:31.120
I think that might have been a bit
ambiguous, that's the problem.

10:31.120 --> 10:33.200
Yeah. I really, genuinely

10:33.200 --> 10:38.200
believe this.
I think this is better than an F40.

10:38.200 --> 10:42.280
I never thought I'd say that,
but it is unbelievably good.

10:42.280 --> 10:47.800
Let me just get this straight,
in evolutionary terms, Ferrari
started with, like, an amoeba. Yeah.

10:47.800 --> 10:49.520
Then they evolved
a bit to plankton.

10:49.520 --> 10:53.760
Then some sort of creature
that crawled out of the slime,
that's where James bought in.

10:53.760 --> 10:56.520
Yeah, he jumped in.
Then they leapt forward, really,

10:56.520 --> 11:01.120
and what we ended up with is Stephen
Fry with Keira Knightley's face.
So one massive leap.

11:01.120 --> 11:04.360
One massive leap... From
where James's was to the next one.

11:04.360 --> 11:06.600
Are you finished?
No, you are. Completely.

11:06.600 --> 11:11.240
Can never drive your car again.
Not in the hours of daylight anyway,
mate, no. No, you can't.

11:11.240 --> 11:14.800
You ate a chocolate bar in my car.

11:14.800 --> 11:17.480
It doesn't matter, you
can't drive it anymore.

11:17.480 --> 11:21.960
Anyway, we must now find out how
fast, how much faster, this goes

11:21.960 --> 11:26.640
around our track then your
useless old car that you
can't drive any more.

11:26.640 --> 11:29.800
That, of course, means handing it
over to our team racing driver.

11:29.800 --> 11:37.360
Some say that he's recently been
releasing pop records under
the pseudonym of Lady Gaga.

11:37.360 --> 11:43.640
And that under his race
suit, he also wears
a red G-string and suspenders.

11:45.160 --> 11:47.840
All we know is,
he's called The Stig!

11:49.520 --> 11:55.560
And, he's off.
No drama, no fuss, launch
control taking care of everything.

11:55.560 --> 12:00.280
Already looking better than a 430,
or the "idiot's Ferrari",
as it's now known.

12:00.280 --> 12:04.280
Smoothly through the
first corner, very nice indeed.

12:04.280 --> 12:07.160
# More than a woman... #

12:07.160 --> 12:12.160
Was that "bald-headed woman"?
Weird lyric. Right, OK.

12:12.160 --> 12:17.080
Out of Chicago, still looking
pretty tidy and very pretty indeed.

12:17.080 --> 12:19.560
And ahead, will this
expose any problems?

12:21.240 --> 12:26.800
Not a bit of it. If I had
a criticism, it's this car is
almost too technical, too precise.

12:26.800 --> 12:29.320
# ..people so in love like you... #

12:29.320 --> 12:31.880
Still, better than a 430.

12:31.880 --> 12:36.320
Now, follow-through, yeah, lovely,
around 570 horsepower working hard.

12:36.320 --> 12:39.040
Quick through the tyres
and sounding good.

12:39.040 --> 12:45.080
Two corners left. Like Tom Cruise
in IKEA, this car is so smooth,
it makes it look effortless.

12:45.080 --> 12:48.480
Through Gambon on all four wheels.
Across the line!

12:50.160 --> 12:51.680
OK. Now...

12:55.760 --> 12:58.840
Here's James's car,
look, the Ferrari 430.

12:58.840 --> 13:03.080
One month, 22 days,
uh...and nine hours.

13:03.080 --> 13:04.840
458, 119.1.

13:04.840 --> 13:07.080
So look at that.

13:07.080 --> 13:12.880
Almost exactly
the same time as an Enzo.

13:15.040 --> 13:18.600
Kind of makes the Enzo look
a bit silly, doesn't it?

13:18.600 --> 13:20.680
Maybe James should get an Enzo now?

13:20.680 --> 13:22.560
Could be the right car.

13:22.560 --> 13:27.320
Now, just briefly, has anybody this
week seen this in the newspapers?

13:27.320 --> 13:31.600
It's the most ridiculous...I think
it was actually an accent thing,

13:31.600 --> 13:35.960
because what she actually said was
"revolting", but it came
out like "fantastic".

13:35.960 --> 13:38.880
No, I think actually what's
happened here is

13:38.880 --> 13:44.280
they've had to cut the quote
to make it fit on the newspaper
and they've had to take out

13:44.280 --> 13:47.360
"an imbecile but James May is..."

13:47.360 --> 13:53.120
No, she didn't say that, James,
because you didn't say one word
to her when she was here. Or you!

13:53.120 --> 13:57.720
Tom Cruise arrived last week,
these two, "Oh, Tom,
I've got a motorbike as well,

13:57.720 --> 14:03.000
"would you like to buy
leather trousers and go off into the
countryside any drink orange juice?"

14:03.000 --> 14:07.800
We couldn't get near to
Cameron because she was
entirely surrounded by you.

14:07.800 --> 14:10.200
She hugged me three times.

14:10.200 --> 14:14.280
She's an actress,
she was pretending, you Muppet.

14:14.280 --> 14:17.560
Not in my mind, she wasn't.
She was remembering the advice.

14:17.560 --> 14:22.720
"Now, Cameron, hug the big
monster and pretend it's not scary".

14:22.720 --> 14:26.160
I'm now on her to-do list.

14:28.680 --> 14:32.240
You're on her restraining order
list, it's the only list you're on.

14:32.240 --> 14:37.120
Anyway, the news. As you probably
saw if you were watching the
Grand Prix coverage last weekend,

14:37.120 --> 14:40.520
the Williams team
bought Rubens Barrichello a T-shirt.

14:40.520 --> 14:41.800
Here he is wearing it.

14:41.800 --> 14:43.080
LAUGHTER

14:43.080 --> 14:44.600
He looks really happy there.

14:44.600 --> 14:45.720
He is really happy.

14:45.720 --> 14:51.000
He's so happy, he's bought the other
Grand Prix drivers who have been
down to Top Gear T-shirts.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.480
And here's Jenson Button
wearing his.

14:53.480 --> 14:54.920
Aw!

14:54.920 --> 14:59.440
I think that demonstrates
that somebody in Formula One
has got a sense of humour.

14:59.440 --> 15:04.640
Makes you wonder, though.
I wonder what Fernando Alonso's
T-shirt would say?

15:06.600 --> 15:09.440
"I made Felipe Massa
give me this T-shirt."

15:12.000 --> 15:14.480
Did anyone see the Grand Prix
last weekend?

15:14.480 --> 15:15.920
AUDIENCE: Yes.

15:15.920 --> 15:23.640
The controversy,
for those of you who didn't,
rule 39:1, to be specific, says,

15:23.640 --> 15:26.680
"No team is allowed to interfere
with the race result."

15:26.680 --> 15:31.880
What that means is you can't tell
one of your drivers to pull over
and let the other one go by.

15:31.880 --> 15:37.480
To make sure teams don't cheat, the
stewards monitor the radio traffic
between the pit and the cars.

15:37.480 --> 15:41.080
So Ferrari needed, last week,
for Massa to get out of the way

15:41.080 --> 15:46.160
and let Alonso go by,
so they use a coded message.
Want to guess what it was?

15:46.160 --> 15:51.760
Was it, "Felipe, the rain in
Paris falls in May?" No, it wasn't.

15:51.760 --> 15:55.560
Was it, "The blue badger flies
under the crafty cow?" I don't know.

15:55.560 --> 16:00.840
No, it wasn't that.
What they actually said was,
"Fernando is faster than you.

16:00.840 --> 16:04.080
"Can you confirm you
understand this message?"

16:05.680 --> 16:08.040
It's not much of a code,
is it, really?

16:08.040 --> 16:11.840
If the German navy had had
a code like that in World War II,

16:11.840 --> 16:17.200
we'd have beaten them in about
a week cos it would have said,
"Ze destroyers are to the left."

16:17.200 --> 16:19.520
The interesting thing
is the punishment.

16:19.520 --> 16:25.040
You may remember McLaren were caught
looking over somebody's shoulder
and copying their homework.

16:25.040 --> 16:28.800
They were fined 100 million and
had all their points taken away.

16:28.800 --> 16:33.920
Ferrari, for this infringement,
were fined 100,000, which is
what they pay Alonso every day.

16:33.920 --> 16:39.440
Really? That's all they were fined
for completely corrupting the
outcome of a World Championship?

16:39.440 --> 16:44.200
It's disgusting.
The only honourable course of action
is for all Ferrari owners

16:44.200 --> 16:48.760
all of them, to go outside now
and smash their cars up.

16:48.760 --> 16:52.960
I think burn them. Yeah, and then
kill themselves, just because

16:52.960 --> 16:56.000
it's the only decent thing to do,
all Ferrari owners.

16:56.000 --> 17:01.280
I'm not just saying this because of
you've been through, but I think
Ferrari were right to do that.

17:01.280 --> 17:05.760
I couldn't agree with you more.
Team orders, they should allow them,
no question.

17:05.760 --> 17:09.720
If I ran a team,
I'd have one fast car, I'd have me
driving around at the back,

17:09.720 --> 17:13.720
shooting anyone who tried to lap me
with a BB gun. That's a team.

17:13.720 --> 17:19.480
Or a paintball gun. Just fit your
second car with a massive wing that
nobody can get past at the back.

17:19.480 --> 17:23.400
I'd do that. Now, Peter Mandelson,
you may remember, he introduced

17:23.400 --> 17:27.160
the scrappage scheme, the idea being
that, if you bought a new car,

17:27.160 --> 17:31.440
you could get Â£2,000
for your old one, irrespective of
its actual value.

17:31.440 --> 17:36.240
So many people took him
up on his offer, they couldn't
crush the cars fast enough.

17:36.240 --> 17:38.160
They were building up on airfields.

17:38.160 --> 17:41.400
We've got a picture of the scale
of the problem. I kid you not.

17:41.400 --> 17:45.080
If you zoom in on the cars here that
we are talking about, look at this.

17:45.080 --> 17:48.360
That's a Mercedes A-class.
There's a Mercedes E-class here.

17:48.360 --> 17:51.320
And a nice Freelander there.
I know. These are just cars.

17:51.320 --> 17:54.720
There's another picture
here with some 4x4s.

17:54.720 --> 17:57.720
I'm sorry, but look at that -
there are Cherokees and Shoguns.

17:57.720 --> 17:59.640
I know, a Land Rover as well.

17:59.640 --> 18:04.200
The thing is, why didn't they just
ring the Taliban and say,

18:04.200 --> 18:09.400
"Look, if you stop shooting at us,
we'll give you a 1997 Shogun
we've got parked."

18:09.400 --> 18:12.600
We ought to make it clear,
that under the scrappage scheme,

18:12.600 --> 18:16.640
the cars that were taken off
the road have to be scrapped.
They can't be sold.

18:16.640 --> 18:19.840
All these cars HAVE to be scrapped.

18:19.840 --> 18:25.680
All the energy that went into making
these cars, now all the energy
that's going into crushing them,

18:25.680 --> 18:28.640
then the energy that goes into
making new cars for people

18:28.640 --> 18:31.800
who wouldn't have bought new cars
if it wasn't for this scheme.

18:31.800 --> 18:35.160
All true. The BBC got some stick
this week for allegedly

18:35.160 --> 18:37.600
over-promoting
Peter Mandelson's new book,

18:37.600 --> 18:40.080
so let's redress that balance.
Don't buy it.

18:40.080 --> 18:43.720
Nice. That's balanced it up a treat.
That's even, it's fair.

18:43.720 --> 18:45.160
APPLAUSE

18:48.280 --> 18:50.480
HE MOUTHS WORDS

18:50.480 --> 18:53.320
Now, there's a new Nissan Micra out.

18:53.320 --> 18:55.000
And that is the end of the news.

18:56.760 --> 19:02.160
Now, a while back, our producers
said to us that we ought to make
a film explaining why

19:02.160 --> 19:07.880
classic British sports cars like
these were so awful and terrible
and horrible in every way

19:07.880 --> 19:11.480
that people went out
and bought hot hatchbacks instead.

19:11.480 --> 19:15.320
But we didn't agree.
We said, "British sports cars
weren't horrible."

19:15.320 --> 19:18.520
And then there was a bit of a row.
Huge row, massive.

19:18.520 --> 19:22.440
What we said to
the producers was, "Top Gear
is shown all over the world.

19:22.440 --> 19:26.840
"And even if British cars
were terrible..." Which they're not.

19:26.840 --> 19:29.400
"..Even if British
sports cars were terrible,

19:29.400 --> 19:33.840
"we're not rushing around
the country saying,
"Everything's horrible here.""

19:33.840 --> 19:38.720
Crocodile Dundee never went
into the outback and said, "It's too
hot and it's full of spiders."

19:38.720 --> 19:43.680
Jack Bauer doesn't run around
America saying, "Don't come,
it's full of terrorists", does he?

19:43.680 --> 19:47.320
The producers, though,
were most insistent.

19:47.320 --> 19:52.120
So they gave each of us Â£5,000
and told us to buy a classic
British sports car with it.

19:52.120 --> 19:55.680
And then we were told to report
with our cars to the Lotus factory

19:55.680 --> 20:00.640
in Norfolk where, as usual,
we would be given some challenges.

20:04.320 --> 20:11.000
'I was the first to arrive
in a car from my era -
the superb Jensen Healey.'

20:11.000 --> 20:14.280
This is a beauty.

20:14.280 --> 20:20.880
Built by Jensen,
designed by the father-and-son team
that brought us the Healey 3-litre,

20:20.880 --> 20:28.680
styled by the same man who
did the Aston Martin Lagonda, and
powered by a twin-cam Lotus engine.

20:28.680 --> 20:34.160
You really can think of this,
then, as being like one of those
old '70s supergroups -

20:34.160 --> 20:36.520
Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young.

20:36.520 --> 20:38.600
Will Young, but...

20:38.600 --> 20:42.120
Oh, hey up. Here we go.
Speak of the devil.

20:42.120 --> 20:45.680
James, that is magnificent!

20:45.680 --> 20:48.840
A TVR-S from your period. It is.
It's the TVR S2, actually.

20:48.840 --> 20:55.000
S2? Yeah, 170 horsepower, Cologne
Ford V6 from Granada. Absolutely.

20:55.000 --> 20:59.400
No, this was superb. And the other
thing about these...
Can you open the boot?

20:59.400 --> 21:02.920
Yes. Yes, I can. You know on
the Antiques Roadshow? Yes.

21:02.920 --> 21:07.080
They always look behind the clock
face and they can tell who made it.

21:07.080 --> 21:08.920
Yes, the maker's mark.

21:08.920 --> 21:14.160
Yeah, well, normally on a TVR,
if you look underneath the carpets
or the roof lining or something

21:14.160 --> 21:17.320
like that, you often find a clue
as to who built the car.

21:17.320 --> 21:19.840
Have you got something?
Yes. There you go.

21:19.840 --> 21:21.800
This was made by a man called...

21:21.800 --> 21:24.200
Nobby? Nobby, I think. Yes, Nobby.

21:24.200 --> 21:25.920
You just don't get that on a...

21:25.920 --> 21:27.760
On a Golf, say. Or a Ferrari. No.

21:27.760 --> 21:30.400
'As we admired
our wonderful cars,

21:30.400 --> 21:38.120
'Richard arrived in a little gem
from his youth - a Lotus Elan.'

21:38.120 --> 21:40.240
Oh, yes!

21:40.240 --> 21:41.960
Oh, ho-ho!

21:41.960 --> 21:44.840
It's come back, it's come home!

21:44.840 --> 21:47.840
Yep, it has.
It's a poetic moment, actually.

21:47.840 --> 21:50.960
The last Elan, here, back at Lotus.
That's terrific.

21:50.960 --> 21:56.600
It is. I remember when this came out,
that square stance it had. Nobody
had built a square car before.

21:56.600 --> 22:00.160
No, nobody had done that.
Yeah, there were reasons for that.

22:00.160 --> 22:02.680
The plastic used to shrink
and they didn't know

22:02.680 --> 22:05.240
that the suppliers had come up
with a new plastic

22:05.240 --> 22:07.960
that didn't shrink.
So it was wider than expected.

22:07.960 --> 22:12.720
This is ingenuity, making the best of
it. It was the same, the TVR -
plastic. There's something

22:12.720 --> 22:16.120
about the plastic body.
The engine in this wasn't Lotus.

22:16.120 --> 22:20.960
No, it's Isuzu.
But that's Japanese - reliable.
When they tested one of these,

22:20.960 --> 22:23.840
they ran it round a racetrack
for 24 hours straight.

22:23.840 --> 22:26.920
And for 22 of those hours,
it didn't break down. Seriously?

22:26.920 --> 22:30.320
'As we chatted,
a challenge arrived.'

22:30.320 --> 22:31.920
You read it, Hammond.

22:31.920 --> 22:37.080
"You will now race around
the Lotus test track to see which
of your ridiculous cars is best..."

22:37.080 --> 22:38.680
"Ridiculous"? Steady on.

22:38.680 --> 22:40.400
It actually says "ridiculous".

22:40.400 --> 22:47.960
It goes on. "..and then you must put
the Stig in a car that wiped your
British sports cars off the map -

22:47.960 --> 22:51.120
"a Peugeot 205 GTI - and set a time."

22:51.120 --> 22:57.400
What, he seriously thinks
a crummy little French hatchback
can beat these purpose-built cars?

22:57.400 --> 23:01.120
Have we got to get the Peugeot? It
says we've got to put him in it, yes.

23:01.120 --> 23:06.080
'First, though, we did some laps
in our classic British sports cars.'

23:10.920 --> 23:17.840
Oh, that this is a stirring scene -
three great British sports cars
haring across the British landscape.

23:19.680 --> 23:22.080
I love the sound of a twin-cam.

23:23.040 --> 23:25.640
It's engine noise you're hearing.

23:25.640 --> 23:27.200
MECHANICAL GRINDING

23:27.200 --> 23:29.600
That's not... Oh, deary me.

23:29.600 --> 23:31.280
CLICK
There we go!

23:31.280 --> 23:34.800
Yes! I knew there'd be one
there if I looked hard enough.

23:36.320 --> 23:38.320
This car is, of course, very light.

23:38.320 --> 23:43.920
It weighs just 987 kilograms
because it's made from
canoe-building materials.

23:43.920 --> 23:47.200
Sorry, scrap that.
Because it's made from composites.

23:47.200 --> 23:53.520
Critically, the Elan is front-wheel
drive because it's just better.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.800
At the same time
this car was coming out,

23:57.800 --> 24:01.600
Mazda were bringing out the MX-5.
Rear-wheel drive, old-fashioned.

24:01.600 --> 24:06.200
As a result,
the MX-5 never REALLY caught on.

24:06.200 --> 24:09.080
I mean it sold in
MASSIVE numbers for decades,

24:09.080 --> 24:12.560
but it didn't have the same
exclusivity that the Elan did,

24:12.560 --> 24:17.760
which never sold in the same
vulgar, brash numbers.

24:19.800 --> 24:25.600
Sometimes with this engine, you do
notice that the oil pressure could
drop alarmingly in a fast corner.

24:25.600 --> 24:30.800
It's OK, the engine would never
blow up because normally
the water pump would go first.

24:30.800 --> 24:33.040
A very useful feature, that.

24:34.920 --> 24:39.600
When you press the throttle
in the TVR, there is a slight delay
before anything happens.

24:39.600 --> 24:44.920
A lot of people thought this was
a fault, but actually it's a
very innovative safety feature.

24:44.920 --> 24:46.000
I'll demonstrate.

24:46.000 --> 24:50.120
You're driving along,
you press the throttle,
the car says, "Are you sure?

24:50.120 --> 24:52.440
ENGINE REVS
"Oh, all right, then."

24:53.160 --> 24:56.680
Look at that TVR in my mirror.

24:56.680 --> 24:59.600
And that Jensen, cornering so flat.

25:03.800 --> 25:05.680
A little bit of history for you.

25:05.680 --> 25:08.640
After the Second World War,
which we won,

25:08.640 --> 25:12.640
Britain was littered
with disused airfields,

25:12.640 --> 25:18.280
and many of them -
like this one, in fact -
were converted into racetracks.

25:18.280 --> 25:21.720
And it was on these twisting,
turning racetracks

25:21.720 --> 25:25.320
that the lightweight,
nimble British sports car

25:25.320 --> 25:28.280
was sort of developed and honed.

25:28.280 --> 25:29.920
HE LAUGHS

25:29.920 --> 25:33.080
'We could have gone round all day.

25:33.080 --> 25:37.680
'But the producers said we must
pull in and post our lap times.'

25:37.680 --> 25:39.800
The time has come, Hammond.

25:39.800 --> 25:42.560
Would you reveal your fastest lap?

25:42.560 --> 25:48.160
My fastest lap in my Lotus Elan
was 2:09. 2:09. Blistering.

25:48.160 --> 25:52.040
That is. There's no other word.
It felt right here.

25:52.040 --> 25:56.360
James. TVR S2, my fastest
lap time was 2:15.9.

25:56.360 --> 26:03.280
2:15.9. And here, the
1970s Jensen Healey, 2:17.9.
So what we can see here is progress.

26:03.280 --> 26:08.520
As you'd expect from the British
sports car industry. That's very
good, That's even better...

26:08.520 --> 26:10.880
The cars have come on,
decade by decade.

26:10.880 --> 26:16.560
And now it's time to find out
how fast the Stig can go round
in this Peugeot 205 GTI.

26:16.560 --> 26:20.960
It doesn't look like a GTI.
No, no, I couldn't get
a GTI, so I got a diesel.

26:20.960 --> 26:25.640
And they're basically the same.
Yeah, same thing, pretty much.
OK, Stig, start it up.

26:25.640 --> 26:27.480
ENGINE REVS

26:27.480 --> 26:29.640
TYRES SCREECH

26:29.640 --> 26:33.680
'The Stig wound up the Peugeot
and began his flying lap.

26:33.680 --> 26:36.560
'Here we go, and... Timing!
..go!

26:36.560 --> 26:43.880
OK, we're off. I think the reason
I couldn't get a GTI, I suspect,

26:43.880 --> 26:49.160
is because they've all rusted away
or been crashed or fallen to pieces.

26:49.160 --> 26:52.280
The handling was terrible on those.
They were crashed a lot.

26:52.280 --> 26:55.760
Any faults with your car? No.
Any faults with yours? No.

26:55.760 --> 27:00.800
Did you know, in the whole
history of TVR, there is no recorded
incident of one ever breaking down?

27:00.800 --> 27:02.480
I've heard that.

27:02.480 --> 27:05.120
And here he comes...

27:05.120 --> 27:08.280
Yes! 2:09, 2:15, 2:17 for us.

27:08.280 --> 27:10.360
RICHARD LAUGHS

27:10.360 --> 27:17.080
2:22.0. Point, I think, proven. 
I don't think we need to go on.

27:17.080 --> 27:22.200
Well, we seem to have another
challenge. I don't know what
it can possibly say.

27:22.200 --> 27:25.680
"You will drive from the Lotus
factory, now owned by the Malaysians

27:25.680 --> 27:30.400
"because the British
made such a mess of everything when
they were in charge..." Come on!

27:30.400 --> 27:32.360
That's not strictly true.

27:32.360 --> 27:39.160
"..to the grave of TVR in Blackpool,
via the site of the long-gone Jensen
factory in the West Midlands.

27:39.160 --> 27:41.040
"This is a journey of 280 miles..."

27:41.040 --> 27:44.440
And that, in kilometres, is 5,000.

27:44.440 --> 27:49.600
Just over. "..which is impossible
in your cars, but no problem at all
for the Stig,

27:49.600 --> 27:56.000
"who will be shadowing
you in a practical, well-made,
much-faster Vauxhall Astra GSi."

28:01.160 --> 28:03.680
'We lined up on the start line

28:03.680 --> 28:08.240
'for our trip across Britain's
historic and beautiful Midlands.'

28:08.240 --> 28:10.880
I've never looked forward
to a journey more.

28:12.120 --> 28:15.000
We do have a magnificent flag
in Britain.

28:15.000 --> 28:18.760
I mean, that one's
on upside-down, but...

28:18.760 --> 28:20.120
beautiful flag.

28:20.120 --> 28:22.840
OK, let the journey commence.

28:27.320 --> 28:28.400
Oh, Lord!

28:32.440 --> 28:35.000
Oh, dear! Is that the Astra?

28:35.000 --> 28:39.720
That was a known fault,
that they would blow up sometimes.
Don't you remember that? Yeah.

28:39.720 --> 28:42.800
I had two friends who had those
and they blew up.

28:42.800 --> 28:47.240
Annoying, because if you're late and
you think, "I'll get in the car."
Bang! Oh, dear.

28:47.240 --> 28:52.600
So there we are. What we can deduce
here is the GERMAN-made hatchback -

28:52.600 --> 28:55.960
the GERMAN-made hatchback -
has exploded.

28:55.960 --> 29:00.040
And all the BRITISH-made
sports cars are working perfectly.

29:00.040 --> 29:01.720
Hang on. What?

29:01.720 --> 29:03.720
It won't start. Oh!

29:04.760 --> 29:10.080
'In a jiffy, though,
we got the fabulous TVR going again
and set off.'

29:12.840 --> 29:17.720
It is extraordinary, when you look
at the British car industry today,

29:17.720 --> 29:22.160
to think what it was like
in the past. I mean,

29:22.160 --> 29:28.720
in 1913, there were 140 different
car makers in Britain. 140.

29:28.720 --> 29:35.480
In 1946, we exported 98,000 cars

29:35.480 --> 29:42.080
and imported 63.
Not 63,000 - 63 in total.

29:42.080 --> 29:46.640
It just beggars belief that
it's all gone so wrong so fast.

29:50.400 --> 29:52.160
Ah.

29:52.160 --> 29:54.680
Yeah, that's one of the clips

29:54.680 --> 30:00.400
that holds the roof on
at the front. Fallen off.

30:00.400 --> 30:06.600
Here's the thing, Lotus has
always been about lightness,

30:06.600 --> 30:13.520
and by shedding parts like this roof
clip that's proven to be extraneous -
it can survive perfectly well

30:13.520 --> 30:17.600
with just one on this side -
it's making itself lighter.

30:21.440 --> 30:28.880
Look at England. It's beautiful.
I'll just wipe the windscreen so
you can have a better look at it.

30:30.880 --> 30:32.640
It's marvellous.

30:35.760 --> 30:40.800
I've just noticed
Richard Hammond's number plate,
it's an anagram of "liar".

30:40.800 --> 30:44.280
Which today is very appropriate.

30:44.280 --> 30:46.080
Oh, and James's, look.

30:46.080 --> 30:48.360
That's an anagram of "gosh".

30:48.360 --> 30:51.800
That fits as well.
A lot of anagrams going on here.

30:56.640 --> 30:59.680
This is very clever.

30:59.680 --> 31:03.640
The neat venting system
around the driver's window here

31:03.640 --> 31:07.760
that allows the cooling, refreshing
breeze in to keep you alert

31:07.760 --> 31:12.280
also allows just enough rain to
come in, just to splash gently

31:12.280 --> 31:16.960
against your face and let you
know, "It's raining, be careful."

31:16.960 --> 31:18.960
That's a safety feature.

31:18.960 --> 31:23.960
'Another safety feature were the
fantastically uncomfortable seats

31:23.960 --> 31:30.640
'fitted to a Jensen,
which meant you couldn't drive
too far without taking a break.'

31:30.640 --> 31:33.440
Ah!

31:34.440 --> 31:36.520
Yep, yep, yep.

31:36.520 --> 31:38.320
There you go.

31:38.320 --> 31:43.240
We've done about 20 miles
which, if you're watching abroad,
is about 700 or 800 kilometres.

31:44.920 --> 31:48.080
Oh, do come on!

31:48.080 --> 31:53.440
And my back...
I mean, after a distance like that,
your back is going to suffer a bit.

31:53.440 --> 31:56.960
1989, this car had
a mobile phone fitted.

31:56.960 --> 32:00.800
I imagine it was enormous.

32:00.800 --> 32:03.920
Â£37, Â£38 to fill it up.

32:03.920 --> 32:07.720
That's about 50 US cents to fill it.

32:07.720 --> 32:10.320
Just pop that shut.

32:33.480 --> 32:37.040
While they attempt to
close my petrol filler cap,

32:37.040 --> 32:40.440
I'm going to choose some music
for the next leg of the journey.

32:40.440 --> 32:43.800
And a good thing about
having an eight-track is that

32:43.800 --> 32:49.240
you can't gets N-Dubz in
this format, or Basement Jaxx.

32:49.240 --> 32:53.720
It's just good stuff -
Blue Oyster Cult, Elton John, Bowie.

32:56.320 --> 33:00.560
# They call them the diamond dogs

33:02.200 --> 33:03.920
# Young girl... #

33:03.920 --> 33:09.480
'We ploughed on and soon we reached
the beautiful city of Birmingham.'

33:09.480 --> 33:14.000
There are more shopping
trolleys in the canals here
than there are in Venice.

33:14.960 --> 33:18.280
This is right in the heart
of car-building territory.

33:18.280 --> 33:23.480
I mean, my grandfather was in the
car-building business, everybody was.

33:25.640 --> 33:33.040
'Eventually,
we arrived in the beauty spot that is
Carters Green, West Bromwich.

33:33.040 --> 33:40.480
'And it was here in this very factory
that Jeremy's Jensen was born.'

33:40.480 --> 33:43.840
Think of all the people
you've got ramming through doors,

33:43.840 --> 33:46.560
full of optimism,
"I've got a brilliant idea!"

33:46.560 --> 33:48.280
Through there. Yeah.

33:49.840 --> 33:57.000
'They also made the
Interceptor FF here, the first ever
four-wheel drive production car.

33:57.000 --> 34:01.760
'It was the brainchild of this man,
Major Tony Rolt,

34:01.760 --> 34:05.720
'one of the team behind the glider
that was built in Colditz.'

34:05.720 --> 34:12.040
I wonder what he'd actually feel
if he could see this place now?

34:12.040 --> 34:16.960
He'd probably wonder why he ever
bothered trying to escape
from Colditz, to be honest.

34:20.480 --> 34:26.239
In the mid-1970s, 26% of the British
workforce was employed in some way

34:26.239 --> 34:28.760
by the manufacturing sector.

34:28.760 --> 34:31.679
Today, it's 9%.

34:31.679 --> 34:34.600
It's not that we don't
make sports cars any more...

34:36.120 --> 34:37.679
..we don't make anything.

34:44.719 --> 34:48.000
'As darkness fell,
we headed on to our overnight stop.'

34:49.880 --> 34:57.080
I've just realised something, it
probably looks as though I'm driving
along huddled in a towel

34:57.080 --> 35:02.440
to keep warm and dry because the
window won't shut and it's raining
in, but that's not the case.

35:02.440 --> 35:03.600
The window's open

35:03.600 --> 35:09.680
because it's so warm, and the
little bit of drizzle - let's not
call it rain - is keeping me cool.

35:09.680 --> 35:16.160
'Eventually I became so hot
I decided I had to pull over
to try to seal the gap.'

35:16.160 --> 35:18.360
Hammond, why are we stopping here?

35:18.360 --> 35:22.160
'Fearful the producers
might be listening,
Hammond had to think fast.'

35:22.160 --> 35:25.600
Picnic! I fancied a picnic.

35:25.600 --> 35:28.600
Just soak it in, enjoy the view.

35:28.600 --> 35:31.240
Do you want some crisps?
Yes, please.

35:31.240 --> 35:33.200
Cornish pasty? Lovely.

35:33.200 --> 35:38.680
See that church? Mmm? That was built
in the Italian Renaissance.

35:38.680 --> 35:41.640
Really?
You should see the frescoes inside.

35:43.320 --> 35:44.880
HE SIGHS

35:51.840 --> 35:53.880
LAUGHTER

35:53.880 --> 35:58.920
TAPE DECK CLICKS
# All night long
You've been looking at me... #

35:58.920 --> 36:04.760
'Picnic over, we cruised to
our overnight halt with our
cars still running beautifully.'

36:04.760 --> 36:06.040
# Oh, well now... #

36:06.040 --> 36:08.400
MECHANICAL GRINDING

36:09.560 --> 36:13.240
OVER WALKIE-TALKIE: 'Have you just
run something over?'

36:13.240 --> 36:16.640
Just a warning noise
to tell you you're on full lock.

36:16.640 --> 36:20.520
OVER WALKIE-TALKIE:
'That's a safety feature.'

36:20.520 --> 36:22.360
Edit that out.

36:24.200 --> 36:25.760
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

36:25.760 --> 36:28.360
We'll pick that up later on.

36:28.360 --> 36:34.320
But now it's time to put a star
in our reasonably-priced car.

36:34.320 --> 36:39.400
A couple of weeks ago we had
Andy Garcia, last week,
Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz,

36:39.400 --> 36:44.520
so we were thinking, "Well,
there's no way we'll be able to get
a big Hollywood name this week."

36:44.520 --> 36:48.360
But then we remembered, "Hang on,
Jonathan Ross isn't on any more."

36:48.360 --> 36:52.000
So, ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome -

36:52.000 --> 36:57.800
star of two of the highest-grossing
films of all time - Jeff Goldblum!

36:57.800 --> 36:59.360
CHEERING

37:02.160 --> 37:06.440
What an honour! Another hug.

37:06.440 --> 37:08.040
Not as good as Cameron's.

37:08.040 --> 37:10.680
Jeff Goldblum, everybody, is here!

37:10.680 --> 37:14.520
On our poky motoring show!
Thank you. Thank you.

37:14.520 --> 37:17.040
Wow!

37:17.040 --> 37:21.080
What an absolute honour to find
someone who's the right size.

37:22.760 --> 37:25.960
Now, obviously we had Tom Cruise
last week... Yes, sir.

37:25.960 --> 37:28.240
Spoke about fighter planes.
I'm thinking

37:28.240 --> 37:33.080
we won't be doing that with you?
Fighter planes? No.
Although I was in The Right Stuff...

37:33.080 --> 37:36.720
Of course you were! I had a little
part, I wasn't a fighter pilot...

37:36.720 --> 37:39.040
You were the man that ran into
the room and said...

37:39.040 --> 37:42.600
"Here comes Sputnik!"
Or something. "It's called Sputnik!"

37:42.600 --> 37:45.920
"It's called Sputnik!"
That's right. That was your line.

37:45.920 --> 37:51.400
But of course the films we know
you best for - well, there are
three big ones, obviously, The Fly

37:51.400 --> 37:54.640
and Jurassic Park and Independence
Day - you play a boffin.

37:54.640 --> 37:57.520
A what? A boffin,
how do we say boffin in American?

37:57.520 --> 38:01.320
That must be British speak.
AUDIENCE: A geek.

38:01.320 --> 38:05.760
But not really...
don't say geek. You can't bring Jeff
Goldblum on and call him a geek.

38:05.760 --> 38:08.400
But boffin,
that's the British term for...

38:08.400 --> 38:14.080
Boffin often means... Techno person?
Mathematician. Academic.

38:14.080 --> 38:18.120
Yeah. I have to ask this, you know
Independence Day, you get up there,

38:18.120 --> 38:21.440
you insert the virus,
how did you have the right lead?

38:21.440 --> 38:24.000
Cos I never have the right lead
for my computer,

38:24.000 --> 38:28.560
and yet you're in
this alien spaceship, and I thought
that was pretty bloody clever.

38:28.560 --> 38:31.520
I was supposed to be very smart.
You were really smart.

38:31.520 --> 38:36.880
Figuring things out that you
didn't even know I was figuring out.
I was very impressed with that.

38:36.880 --> 38:39.560
So you are over here in London
appearing in...

38:39.560 --> 38:44.160
A lovely play by the great
Neil Simon, called
The Prisoner Of Second Avenue

38:44.160 --> 38:50.240
at the Vaudeville Theatre
eight times a week, 7:30 at night,
2:30 on Saturdays and Thursdays...

38:50.240 --> 38:51.960
And ticket prices...?

38:51.960 --> 38:53.600
Comfortable seats available?

38:53.600 --> 38:57.280
Well within their reach. And we do
it until the end of September.

38:57.280 --> 39:01.400
One of the things
I'm absolutely fascinated by is,
you are a big name, OK?

39:01.400 --> 39:06.360
You have appeared in, as I've said,
two of the highest-grossing films
of all time.

39:06.360 --> 39:10.280
What is it that causes you to say,
"I'm going to appear
in a play in London?"

39:10.280 --> 39:13.760
Why do you want to do that?
Well, the theatre in London...

39:13.760 --> 39:17.400
London is, first of all, one of
the great cities of the world,

39:17.400 --> 39:23.480
it's just a thrill to be here,
and the theatre here has a tradition
and a standard of excellence that is

39:23.480 --> 39:29.480
the highest anywhere. And so this is
the height for me. So it's acting
is what we're talking about here,

39:29.480 --> 39:35.480
because you have a great love
of acting? I do. Now, cars.
What do you drive now?

39:35.480 --> 39:40.440
I've got an SUV Mercedes M-Class.
It's an interesting...not so
interesting, but here's the story.

39:40.440 --> 39:45.720
In 1990... Whenever the second
Jurassic Park came out...
The Lost World. The Lost World.

39:45.720 --> 39:49.360
..they introduced the M-class,
that SUV, Mercedes, in that film.

39:49.360 --> 39:51.840
They were camouflaged
and we took them on the adventure.

39:51.840 --> 39:54.680
They told me a few months later,
when the film came out,

39:54.680 --> 39:57.880
"Hey, if you show up at one of our
international sales meetings

39:57.880 --> 40:03.560
"and say hello to everybody, we'll
give you one." I said, "Oh, OK."

40:03.560 --> 40:08.760
I did like that.
They gave me one and that's
the car I'm still driving.

40:08.760 --> 40:13.920
So you just get a free car and then
thought, "Just stick with it?"

40:13.920 --> 40:16.640
That's correct. In the meantime...
I know you have

40:16.640 --> 40:20.880
strong feelings about this, but
I got a Prius several years ago...

40:20.880 --> 40:23.120
No, no, no...
I want to make this quite...

40:23.120 --> 40:27.040
Since Cameron came here last week,
and she's very much in love with me,

40:27.040 --> 40:32.920
she's converted me to
environmentalism, and I like the
Prius now because she's got one.

40:32.920 --> 40:35.120
Sweet, sweet.

40:35.120 --> 40:37.640
Just because
she didn't fancy you lot!

40:37.640 --> 40:41.520
But I want a new car maybe,
and I'm open-minded to what

40:41.520 --> 40:46.840
is the most environmental -
because I like that idea... As do I.

40:46.840 --> 40:51.120
You know? But I want a fun car, too.
Let's see if we can't work out

40:51.120 --> 40:54.600
what this car should be.
What should Jeff drive?

40:54.600 --> 40:56.600
AUDIENCE SHOUT OVER EACH OTHER

40:56.600 --> 41:00.240
A Bugatti Veyron,
I'm not sure that fulfils

41:00.240 --> 41:03.960
the environmental side of it.
I see you and something Italian.

41:03.960 --> 41:09.400
My older brother had a love affair
with the Lancia Aurelia years ago,
and had one.

41:09.400 --> 41:13.760
He was a car fanatic,
and he was restoring it
and tinkering with it every day.

41:13.760 --> 41:19.720
"Tinkering with it" when you have
a Lancia is another way of saying
"trying to make it start."

41:19.720 --> 41:24.480
You go to a Lancia and... "I'd
better just tinker with it and see
if I can coax some life into it!"

41:24.480 --> 41:27.040
Has anyone else
got any more thoughts?

41:27.040 --> 41:29.200
An Evo?!

41:29.200 --> 41:32.120
Do you...
How stupid do you think he looks?!

41:32.120 --> 41:37.320
An Evo, what...? An Evo, It's a car
driven by people who look like this.

41:38.360 --> 41:41.600
When you say to them,
"What do you drive?," they go,

41:41.600 --> 41:43.360
(NORTHERN ACCENT) "Got an Evo."

41:43.360 --> 41:44.440
"Evo." "Evo."

41:44.440 --> 41:47.920
That's it. You could have one,
actually, you're very good at that.

41:49.760 --> 41:52.720
Anyway, we get onto the
whole business of the day here.

41:52.720 --> 41:57.880
You arrived and you had,
like Christopher Eccleston,

41:57.880 --> 42:01.920
the actor, the former Dr Who
who came down, he could not drive
a manual car.

42:01.920 --> 42:05.520
So we found an automatic. You say it
broke down? Here's what happened.

42:05.520 --> 42:10.840
They didn't tell me that
the automatic, even at its best,
would be slower.

42:10.840 --> 42:15.720
Did you not feel that? It's one
second slower to 60. I didn't know.
I hadn't done the other one.

42:15.720 --> 42:20.200
But anyway, luckily it broke down
and I thought,
"Oh, no, what do I do now?"

42:20.200 --> 42:22.360
I had to learn the thing,
and they told me,

42:22.360 --> 42:26.320
"This is going to be a little faster
car anyway," so I said,
"Oh, that's good."

42:26.320 --> 42:28.600
So you went to the manual.
Here's what

42:28.600 --> 42:33.840
a little bird has told me,
you did the entire lap,
apart from the start, in third gear?

42:35.640 --> 42:40.440
Well, this is the first I've heard
that that might not be advisable.

42:43.520 --> 42:47.960
I said I was... The great teacher...
Yeah.

42:47.960 --> 42:51.760
The wizard said...
The Stig, you mean? Yes!

42:51.760 --> 42:52.920
Is he a wizard as well?

42:52.920 --> 42:55.560
He can do anything,
he's a magical, magical man.

42:55.560 --> 42:58.600
He got me through the first...
"Here's first, second."

42:58.600 --> 43:01.200
And I said, "And third?"
He said, "Stay in third."

43:01.200 --> 43:04.040
Now why would the Stig do that?

43:04.040 --> 43:08.520
I'm sure he had his reasons.
He was masterful and I adore him,
but what happened?

43:08.520 --> 43:11.160
It was not good to stay in third?

43:11.160 --> 43:14.280
No. Really no, no, no.
Coming down the back straight,

43:14.280 --> 43:17.880
you need to be in fourth
and even fifth because the car
will go to 100 mph,

43:17.880 --> 43:21.080
but not in third. Well, it will,
but valves will come out.

43:21.080 --> 43:23.960
I'm very upset,
cos I was thinking...

43:23.960 --> 43:27.760
I was enjoying it no end,
and once I, you know,
got the hang of what to do,

43:27.760 --> 43:31.400
when you're really pressing it
and you're going on, I went, "Jeez,

43:31.400 --> 43:36.440
"I wish there was more car
under me, I wish it would do more."

43:36.440 --> 43:40.680
Is it something you've done before
ever, driving around a track?
No, no, never.

43:40.680 --> 43:41.840
Never in your life?

43:41.840 --> 43:43.680
Never in my life, no.

43:43.680 --> 43:47.880
So who would like to see Jeff's lap,
bearing in mind

43:47.880 --> 43:51.720
he's never driven round a track
before, and was in third
the entire way?

43:51.720 --> 43:53.440
AUDIENCE: Yeah!

43:53.440 --> 43:55.280
Come on, let's have a look here. OK.

43:55.280 --> 43:56.920
ENGINE REVS AND TYRES SCREECH

43:56.920 --> 43:59.520
'You see there's first
and second and third.'

43:59.520 --> 44:02.480
'I understand.'
'That's second, I saw it change.'

44:02.480 --> 44:07.160
All right, baby.
Feeling better with that, er, stick.

44:07.160 --> 44:10.680
'Stick, that's gear lever.

44:10.680 --> 44:12.640
'Oh, late brake.

44:12.640 --> 44:14.520
'Still in third.' 'Yes.'

44:14.520 --> 44:16.240
'OK, well, there we are.

44:16.240 --> 44:17.320
'Got round nicely,'

44:17.320 --> 44:18.600
very nicely, actually.

44:18.600 --> 44:19.680
Really? Yup.

44:19.680 --> 44:23.280
Can you believe that?
Now, watch this!

44:23.280 --> 44:25.640
'Don't say "watch this".
It's the precursor

44:25.640 --> 44:28.840
'to all big crashes when a man says,
"Watch this!"' 'Really?'

44:28.840 --> 44:30.880
'But you DIDN'T crash.'

44:30.880 --> 44:35.280
I wish it was faster right here.
I'm putting it to the floor
but I wish I had more car.

44:35.280 --> 44:37.520
'That's what I said.'
'Go into fourth!

44:37.520 --> 44:39.640
'Second gear here,
or are you in third?'

44:39.640 --> 44:41.960
'Third. I didn't know fourth.'
LAUGHTER

44:41.960 --> 44:44.920
I did not know fourth or fifth
would give me more power.

44:44.920 --> 44:49.640
'Up to third.
You need to go in second
and that would go a bit more.'

44:49.640 --> 44:52.080
I wish I had more speed right now.

44:52.080 --> 44:54.520
LAUGHTER

44:54.520 --> 44:57.880
'The stick, pull the stick!
Listen to it!

44:57.880 --> 45:01.840
'Valves are bouncing out
through the bonnet.

45:01.840 --> 45:04.320
'Third gear,
listen to the little thing!

45:04.320 --> 45:07.720
'You must have been sitting with
the revs right on the red line.

45:07.720 --> 45:10.640
'That's a good run through
that corner. That is third.

45:10.640 --> 45:12.400
'And here we go, all four wheels?

45:12.400 --> 45:15.080
'Yes! Very un-Tom Cruise-like
and there we are,

45:15.080 --> 45:16.760
'across the line, everybody!'

45:16.760 --> 45:19.240
CHEERING

45:25.040 --> 45:31.000
It's a whole new thing. Anyway.
Here are the people who have been
around so far. We have got

45:31.000 --> 45:33.640
the 1:44.2 sitting at the top
with Mr Cruise.

45:33.640 --> 45:40.920
And then 1:49.9 was the slowest
we've ever had round here, who is
a man called Nick Robinson.

45:40.920 --> 45:43.400
So, where do you think
you have come?

45:43.400 --> 45:45.160
I mean, I must come last.

45:45.160 --> 45:47.040
I must be in last.

45:47.040 --> 45:49.800
You, yeah, you, yeah.

45:49.800 --> 45:52.800
LAUGHTER
Oh, this is a bitter pill.

45:52.800 --> 45:56.920
Because on the track
they were saying, as I was doing
another lap or two,

45:56.920 --> 45:59.840
they were saying,
"Jeez, and you just learned.

45:59.840 --> 46:02.240
"This may be a very happy ending.

46:02.240 --> 46:06.600
"Just fix another thing
or two..." I thought I was
breaking records or something.

46:06.600 --> 46:10.720
You were breaking records.
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

46:10.720 --> 46:17.520
No, no, no, you did it
in third gear in one...

46:17.520 --> 46:19.160
forty-...

46:20.680 --> 46:23.520
nine dead.

46:23.520 --> 46:25.600
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

46:25.600 --> 46:27.600
SPEECH DROWNED BY APPLAUSE

46:27.600 --> 46:32.720
You're faster than
Peta, 23, from Essex.

46:34.560 --> 46:37.880
Congratulations.
Thank you very much.

46:39.640 --> 46:43.080
Are you pleased, are you proud?

46:43.080 --> 46:45.040
Yes. Yes.

46:45.040 --> 46:47.440
I'm happy as a clam. Excellent.

46:47.440 --> 46:53.560
Ladies and gentlemen and what a huge
pleasure to have you here, good luck
with the play, Jeff Goldblum!

46:53.560 --> 46:55.680
CHEERING

46:55.680 --> 46:58.160
Excellent.

46:58.160 --> 47:01.000
Now, tonight, we are on a quest

47:01.000 --> 47:05.560
to prove that old
British sports cars were brilliant.

47:05.560 --> 47:09.440
Meanwhile, our producers are on
a quest to prove that the reason

47:09.440 --> 47:13.560
they were killed off
by hot hatchbacks is because
they were better.

47:13.560 --> 47:16.920
So, we now rejoin the action
for a safety test

47:16.920 --> 47:19.480
at the top-secret
Prodrive test track,

47:19.480 --> 47:24.280
just off the A 4177 between Honiley
and Baddesley Clinton.
It's on the left.

47:26.840 --> 47:30.320
'To try and show us that hot
hatchbacks are safer than our cars,

47:30.320 --> 47:35.080
'the producers asked The Stig
to get into a Citroen AX GT,

47:35.080 --> 47:40.800
'which would then be dragged by
a special cable into the side
of a lorry at 50 miles an hour.'

47:54.640 --> 47:56.600
Didn't do well at all, did it?

47:57.560 --> 48:03.480
Well, there it is.
That's the benchmark and that is
a fail, isn't it? That's a fail, yes.

48:05.040 --> 48:10.440
'We then decided that
because we are a team, only one of
us actually needed to do this test.'

48:10.440 --> 48:17.240
Should I wear a crash helmet?
If anything goes wrong here, a crash
helmet will make NO difference, mate.

48:17.240 --> 48:21.080
It'll make it easier
to find his head. It will keep
the bits in one place.

48:21.080 --> 48:24.960
This is the safest thing
anyone has ever done.

48:24.960 --> 48:28.200
Look at the inertia reel
seat belt you get in a Jenson.

48:28.200 --> 48:30.960
Could you just make that go
a bit further in the back.

48:30.960 --> 48:33.640
I don't want you to ever
say that to me again!

48:36.320 --> 48:41.560
You see, how cheerful am
I about what I am about to do? Yeah.

48:42.560 --> 48:44.800
# Sunrise

48:44.800 --> 48:46.560
# This is the last day... #

48:46.560 --> 48:48.880
I've got Tony Christie
on my eight-track.

48:48.880 --> 48:53.080
The seat belt is on, good, strong,
dependable seat belt... Oh, I'm off!

48:58.000 --> 49:01.360
Bye! I see a mean...

49:01.360 --> 49:05.120
Oh, I'd better concentrate because
I'm going into the lorry. Brace!

49:07.040 --> 49:08.360
Brace!

49:13.200 --> 49:15.640
How safe is this car?

49:15.640 --> 49:17.920
That's a pass. That is a pass.

49:17.920 --> 49:20.440
Thank God he wasn't
in that little Citroen.

49:22.160 --> 49:26.320
'Having proved, as a team, that our
cars are safer than hot hatches,

49:26.320 --> 49:29.840
'we continued onwards and soon,
we were in a very special place.'

49:29.840 --> 49:35.160
This is where Richard Hammond
was actually born.

49:36.880 --> 49:39.520
This is a beautiful town, Richard.

49:39.520 --> 49:42.400
You are very lucky to have
been born here, Hammond.

49:42.400 --> 49:43.440
Am I ever?

49:43.440 --> 49:45.440
Fond memories.

49:45.440 --> 49:49.400
Usmania,
"complete home furnishings".

49:49.400 --> 49:52.200
That's where the Queen
buys all her furniture.

49:52.200 --> 49:54.760
Happy communities.

49:54.760 --> 49:59.240
Man cleaning windows, or is he
breaking in? No, he is cleaning them.

50:00.680 --> 50:05.280
'Sadly, my trip down memory lane
was interrupted by the producers,

50:05.280 --> 50:11.800
'who said we must go to
a petrol station where they would
test our cars' waterproof-ness.'

50:11.800 --> 50:13.400
Shakespeare country, this.

50:13.400 --> 50:16.680
I know. I noticed Shakespeare's
Estate Agents. Yes, very much.

50:16.680 --> 50:19.760
I presume we're having to do
the test of the waterproofing

50:19.760 --> 50:23.000
of the cars at a car wash because
it so rarely rains in Britain.

50:23.000 --> 50:25.840
When would it happen?
So we need to do that, yes.

50:25.840 --> 50:28.680
OK! What is that?

50:28.680 --> 50:31.360
Nothing, nothing.
I've parked over an oil spill.

50:31.360 --> 50:32.840
Can I just check that? Is it?

50:32.840 --> 50:33.960
Yeah.

50:33.960 --> 50:37.040
You've parked over a bit of
hanging-off bodywork as well.

50:37.040 --> 50:43.360
'To try and stop the producers
endlessly filming the boring oil
spill, James started the test.'

50:45.240 --> 50:46.880
Do your worst.

50:46.880 --> 50:51.960
A lot of people do like to turn up
and watch cars being washed
around Solihull and Shirley.

50:53.760 --> 50:55.440
Edit that out.

50:55.440 --> 50:58.760
'The TVR passed with flying colours.'

51:00.680 --> 51:02.320
Death Valley.

51:03.520 --> 51:06.080
'And so did the Jensen.'

51:06.080 --> 51:11.200
Nuclear submarines have
more leaks than this does.

51:12.120 --> 51:14.480
'So, then, I lined up the Lotus.'

51:14.480 --> 51:20.000
There is a bit coming in,
I'll be honest - yeah, some.

51:21.720 --> 51:25.560
Let's have a look.
I'll be staggered if he's dry.

51:25.560 --> 51:27.880
No, It's fine. I spilt my drink.

51:27.880 --> 51:30.040
Not again? Was it just water?

51:30.040 --> 51:33.120
Yes, water and a bit of soap.

51:34.640 --> 51:40.320
'To then prove, again, to the
producers why hot hatchbacks
were so poor, we asked The Stig

51:40.320 --> 51:46.040
'to take a Ford Escort XR3i
through the same car wash.'

51:46.040 --> 51:50.680
Has The Stig ever been to
a car wash before? No, it'll be
a whole new experience for him.

51:55.240 --> 51:56.440
What do you think?

51:56.440 --> 51:59.320
Well, it's got a solid roof.

52:01.680 --> 52:04.920
What is that coming
out of the sky now?

52:04.920 --> 52:07.280
That's a bit of over-spray
from the car wash.

52:09.640 --> 52:11.320
He's coming now, gentlemen.

52:13.920 --> 52:17.080
Here he comes now.
Oh, it's not gone well!

52:17.080 --> 52:20.240
Oh, my God!

52:21.760 --> 52:23.880
MUFFLED:
Now I come to think of it,

52:23.880 --> 52:26.960
this is the main reason
I didn't buy an XR3.

52:26.960 --> 52:29.480
I lost a couple of friends
like this.

52:29.480 --> 52:32.040
MUFFLED: It's one of the reasons

52:32.040 --> 52:37.280
the insurance premiums were so high,
it's because of this leaking issue.

52:43.280 --> 52:48.840
'Buoyed by yet another victory,
we rolled on up our equivalent of
Highway 1 towards Blackpool.'

52:48.840 --> 52:53.560
Oh, God. Now, this is something,
if you're watching this abroad,

52:53.560 --> 52:59.800
it's something I have
never seen before,
roadworks on a British motorway.

52:59.800 --> 53:01.640
That is unusual.

53:03.640 --> 53:07.560
'But then, we were made
to turn off Highway 1.'

53:07.560 --> 53:12.440
I don't know why the producers
have made us come THROUGH Stoke
rather than round it.

53:12.440 --> 53:14.360
But I'm mighty glad they did.

53:14.360 --> 53:21.160
We three can count ourselves
amongst the four million tourists
visiting Stoke every year.

53:21.960 --> 53:23.960
OK.

53:24.960 --> 53:28.440
The car is beginning to smell
like I need a picnic again.

53:28.440 --> 53:31.120
What do you fancy?
Oil - er, sorry, biscuits?

53:31.120 --> 53:36.480
No, I'm fine.
One of the more popular places
in England, this, for a picnic.

53:36.480 --> 53:41.440
The reason is, that house there,
you see the lilac one,
four along, can you see that?

53:41.440 --> 53:43.480
Robbie Williams lives there.

53:43.480 --> 53:49.200
Have you admired it for long enough?
Yes, it's a good idea when you stop
to check your engine is still there.

53:49.200 --> 53:51.360
Just having a look, it's nice.

53:51.360 --> 53:53.320
Lovely. Better for seeing that.

53:53.320 --> 53:57.800
Have you had your picnic?
I have had a lovely picnic.
I am absolutely full again.

53:57.800 --> 53:59.920
Would you be needing a picnic again?

53:59.920 --> 54:03.680
Another hour or so and I'll want
a quick picnic before Blackpool.

54:06.560 --> 54:11.120
'Blackpool was just
15 miles away but the producers,
infuriated by our good progress,

54:11.120 --> 54:16.200
'ordered us to pull over at a garden
centre for yet another challenge.'

54:17.480 --> 54:18.840
JEREMY CLEARS THROAT

54:18.840 --> 54:22.280
"One of the main reasons people
switched from British sports cars

54:22.280 --> 54:27.160
"to European hot hatchbacks,
apart from reliability, price,
comfort, speed, handling..."

54:27.160 --> 54:31.800
I don't think so, as we have proved.
"..is practicality.

54:31.800 --> 54:35.360
"To prove this point, you will
load up a Golf GTI with items

54:35.360 --> 54:40.920
"from the garden centre
and then you will see how much
you can get in YOUR cars."

54:44.480 --> 54:50.800
'This is a MkI GTI,
the first of the breed, the breed
that killed the British sports car.

54:50.800 --> 54:53.920
'So, let's see
what we can get into that boot.'

54:58.600 --> 54:59.720
Whoa, careful.

54:59.720 --> 55:01.200
I shall open the boot.

55:01.200 --> 55:04.560
We'll just... You need to take...
The parcel shelf down.

55:06.440 --> 55:10.120
There it is. OK. There we are.

55:13.600 --> 55:16.040
No. Ah. No, you see.

55:16.040 --> 55:19.800
If you can't get a rose arch into
a Golf GTI... What can you get in?

55:19.800 --> 55:21.720
Exactly.

55:23.480 --> 55:28.000
'After a quick shop, we hit the road
and made our point.'

55:35.920 --> 55:40.760
Here's the thing.
If you had gone to the garden
centre with a hot hatchback,

55:40.760 --> 55:44.400
the biggest thing you could
have brought home is a pansy.

55:44.400 --> 55:47.760
I'm going home with
a bamboo and a conifer.

55:49.280 --> 55:54.160
TVR, the car that came out of
the shed, now, underneath one.

55:57.320 --> 55:58.960
This is awkward.

55:58.960 --> 56:03.040
Her bottom is quite close to my face.

56:06.480 --> 56:10.000
'There was, however,
a serious point to be made here.'

56:11.520 --> 56:16.320
We were all rather dazzled by the
XR3i and the Golf GTI and so on,

56:16.320 --> 56:18.760
but really, it was a bit of a fad.

56:18.760 --> 56:24.080
Nobody these days is saying,
"Oh, I'd love an old XR3."

56:24.080 --> 56:28.320
But a Jensen Healey,
a Lotus, a TVR, yes.

56:30.040 --> 56:35.240
'As we neared journey's end,
Richard became a bit emotional.'

56:35.240 --> 56:39.360
I think driving to a British
seaside resort, Blackpool,

56:39.360 --> 56:45.040
in a funny little British sports car
with a naked lady statue and a giant
urn on the seat next to me,

56:45.040 --> 56:49.760
is, above all else, fun.

56:49.760 --> 56:54.240
And for all our serious side,
the British have always
been rather good at fun.

56:54.240 --> 57:01.960
The whole experience is tinged at
all times with the knowledge that we
are doing something that has ended.

57:04.440 --> 57:09.920
And finally,
we end with James's TVR coming home.

57:16.280 --> 57:19.160
'This is the home in question.

57:19.160 --> 57:22.440
'The factory where it was made.'

57:22.440 --> 57:23.800
This one, I remember.

57:23.800 --> 57:25.440
I remember this.

57:25.440 --> 57:28.040
Because they made them everywhere,
didn't they?

57:28.040 --> 57:31.160
They were in that one and that
one and this one and this one.

57:31.160 --> 57:34.960
It was busy. Everything got moved...
It wasn't efficient.

57:34.960 --> 57:37.000
No, but busy and they made stuff.

57:37.000 --> 57:39.720
Oh, my God, look at that.

57:39.720 --> 57:42.680
Ooh, I remember those.
They were Tamsins.

57:42.680 --> 57:46.280
And the grey one was a 3-litre.

57:46.280 --> 57:48.240
That was the Taimar.

57:48.240 --> 57:51.360
Because it wasn't a little burst,
was it?

57:51.360 --> 57:54.080
It was a few decades.
1947, TVR started.

57:54.080 --> 57:56.680
Same as Land Rover.

57:56.680 --> 58:01.600
That is actually a part of
the manufacturing process
there dumped on the floor.

58:01.600 --> 58:04.960
A huge amount of work
went into making that.

58:10.560 --> 58:13.400
Isn't that the mould
for the bonnet of your car?

58:18.920 --> 58:23.880
There's nothing quieter than
a no-longer-functioning factory,
is there?

58:23.880 --> 58:26.360
It's particularly noticeable quiet.

58:26.360 --> 58:28.280
I hate it.

58:30.160 --> 58:33.040
My car was in here once, though.
Yeah.

58:33.040 --> 58:35.880
Going through here, being built.

58:35.880 --> 58:39.920
And it was all new and somebody was
very excited about it somewhere.

58:39.920 --> 58:43.680
My TVR is coming next week,
it's an S2.

58:51.400 --> 58:53.840
What have you found?
Some more Nobby work?

58:53.840 --> 58:55.600
Yeah! Oh, really?

58:55.600 --> 58:57.200
I'll lean on that bit.

58:57.200 --> 58:59.920
JAMES LAUGHS

58:59.920 --> 59:03.040
Oh, that's really sad.
Let me just see what the word was?

59:03.040 --> 59:04.560
I thought so!

59:08.160 --> 59:11.760
'It was horrible to walk round
this industrial wilderness.

59:11.760 --> 59:13.800
'There were so many memories,

59:13.800 --> 59:16.400
'so many thoughts
of what might have been.

59:50.520 --> 59:56.440
'There are, of course,
good reasons why almost all
these great names are gone.

01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:05.360
'But after our journey
across the width of Britain,

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:08.320
'we really couldn't
remember what they were.'

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:18.520
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:28.000
The weird thing is, I think,
when you drive a car like that,

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.120
you actually can't help becoming
a bit misty-eyed and wistful.

01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:35.000
You drive them really with
rose-tinted spectacles on.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Exactly, and there was
a little piece of music
in the first part of the film

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.920
that summed it up perfectly,
they are diamond dogs.

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:47.640
You are exactly right.
And I have to say, this hurts, but,
Richard, I think yours was the best.

01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:51.640
No, I think James's was the best.
No, I have to disagree
with both of you.

01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:55.040
Your car was definitely the best.
It was superb.

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:59.080
Why don't we just say that they were
all the best? Let's agree on that.

01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:02.720
And on that unusually harmonious
bombshell, it is time to end,

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:05.400
not just the programme,
but the whole series.

01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:07.280
Thank you so much for watching.

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:09.320
Take care. See you soon.

01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:11.480
