Here are the house rules:

00:08.133 --> 00:09.343
You can't reach for seconds

00:09.384 --> 00:11.052
until you're finished

00:09.384 --> 00:11.052
with your first,

00:11.094 --> 00:12.429
but as soon

00:11.094 --> 00:12.429
as anybody's fork

00:12.471 --> 00:14.055
leaves the perimeter

00:12.471 --> 00:14.055
of their plate,

00:14.097 --> 00:15.265
all bets are off.

01:15.617 --> 01:17.118
You're all set,

01:15.617 --> 01:17.118
Mrs. Gunderberg.

01:17.160 --> 01:19.120
Remember, this is the

01:17.160 --> 01:19.120
one you take orally.

01:19.162 --> 01:20.622
REESE: I can do what I want,

01:19.162 --> 01:20.622
because I'm older!

01:20.664 --> 01:22.123
DEWEY: Stop pushing me! Ow!

01:20.664 --> 01:22.123
MALCOLM: Shut up, Dewey!

01:22.165 --> 01:23.124
REESE: Stop touching me!

01:22.165 --> 01:23.124
MALCOLM: I was not!

01:23.166 --> 01:24.418
Yes, you were!

01:23.166 --> 01:24.418
Stop it!

01:24.459 --> 01:26.127
Hey, guys. My shift is over

01:24.459 --> 01:26.127
in five minutes.

01:26.169 --> 01:27.629
Then we head over

01:26.169 --> 01:27.629
to the barber college.

01:27.671 --> 01:29.339
Why can't we go

01:27.671 --> 01:29.339
to a real barber?

01:29.381 --> 01:31.132
Because I like to

01:29.381 --> 01:31.132
support education.

01:31.174 --> 01:32.426
Besides, it's free.

01:32.467 --> 01:35.512
Are they going to take

01:32.467 --> 01:35.512
my hair and plant an evil Dewey?

01:35.554 --> 01:37.765
Honey, we've already

01:35.554 --> 01:37.765
had this talk.

01:37.806 --> 01:40.768
Every word that comes out

01:37.806 --> 01:40.768
of Reese's mouth

01:40.809 --> 01:42.436
is a lie, remember?

01:42.477 --> 01:44.438
Ah!

01:42.477 --> 01:44.438
Okay, go look

01:42.477 --> 01:44.438
at some magazines.

01:44.479 --> 01:48.025
And anything you break

01:44.479 --> 01:48.025
comes out of your allowance.

01:48.067 --> 01:49.234
REESE: We don't get

01:48.067 --> 01:49.234
an allowance.

01:49.276 --> 01:50.402
Yeah, now you know why.

01:50.444 --> 01:52.153
I'm going to ask the barber

01:52.195 --> 01:54.155
to shave this side totally off

01:54.197 --> 01:56.157
and leave

01:54.197 --> 01:56.157
the other side long.

01:56.199 --> 01:58.159
You know, a style

01:56.199 --> 01:58.159
for each profile.

01:58.201 --> 02:00.704
A different look

01:58.201 --> 02:00.704
for both my moods.

02:03.916 --> 02:05.250
How's it going?

02:03.916 --> 02:05.250
Not bad.

02:05.292 --> 02:08.003
In five minutes I get my soul

02:05.292 --> 02:08.003
back for the night. And you?

02:08.045 --> 02:09.046
Can't complain.

02:09.088 --> 02:11.840
That's $6.24.

02:11.882 --> 02:14.885
I-I'm... I'm sorry. What?

02:14.927 --> 02:17.596
Your total is $6.24.

02:19.222 --> 02:21.016
Uh, is there a problem?

02:21.058 --> 02:23.477
No, it's just

02:21.058 --> 02:23.477
that, uh...

02:23.518 --> 02:25.228
your assistant

02:23.518 --> 02:25.228
manager and I

02:25.270 --> 02:26.981
we have an

02:25.270 --> 02:26.981
arrangement.

02:27.022 --> 02:29.691
I wouldn't know

02:27.022 --> 02:29.691
anything about that.

02:31.026 --> 02:33.361
I've only got $3.00.

02:33.403 --> 02:35.405
Well, you can put back

02:33.403 --> 02:35.405
the magazine.

02:35.447 --> 02:41.036
Lois, Lois... I give

02:35.447 --> 02:41.036
Officer Stockton a discount.

02:41.078 --> 02:42.203
You know,

02:41.078 --> 02:42.203
policeman's discount?

02:42.245 --> 02:43.204
(whispers):

02:42.245 --> 02:43.204
100% off?

02:43.246 --> 02:44.498
Craig, I can't do that.

02:44.539 --> 02:45.666
But, Lois...

02:45.707 --> 02:47.709
Don't worry about it.

02:45.707 --> 02:47.709
It's okay, Greg.

02:47.751 --> 02:50.004
It's "Craig."

02:50.045 --> 02:51.212
What are you, crazy?

02:51.254 --> 02:52.506
Don't you know

02:51.254 --> 02:52.506
how this works?

02:52.547 --> 02:55.258
We scratch his back,

02:52.547 --> 02:55.258
he scratches ours?

02:55.300 --> 02:56.301
We give him

02:55.300 --> 02:56.301
a few candy bars,

02:56.343 --> 02:57.385
he looks out for us.

02:57.427 --> 02:58.720
It's called protection.

02:58.762 --> 03:01.140
Craig, we have been

02:58.762 --> 03:01.140
robbed five times

03:01.180 --> 03:02.432
in the last six months.

03:02.474 --> 03:05.936
Lois, think of all the places

03:02.474 --> 03:05.936
he gets free stuff from.

03:05.978 --> 03:07.938
He can't be everywhere

03:05.978 --> 03:07.938
at once.

03:14.153 --> 03:15.612
Mom, seriously,

03:14.153 --> 03:15.612
I'm not letting that kid

03:15.654 --> 03:18.157
with two fingers

03:15.654 --> 03:18.157
cut my hair again.

03:18.197 --> 03:20.241
That's all you need

03:18.197 --> 03:20.241
to use scissors.

03:20.283 --> 03:21.326
And you be polite.

03:21.368 --> 03:24.245
Those people are

03:21.368 --> 03:24.245
nervous enough as it is.

03:24.287 --> 03:26.832
(siren wails)

03:24.287 --> 03:26.832
Oh, what?

03:26.874 --> 03:28.249
I didn't do anything!

03:28.291 --> 03:29.250
Make a run for it, Mom.

03:29.292 --> 03:30.251
We can be on the news.

03:30.293 --> 03:31.920
All right, you boys, not

03:30.293 --> 03:31.920
a word out of any of you.

03:31.962 --> 03:34.631
No one makes piggy sounds,

03:31.962 --> 03:34.631
no one says they smell bacon,

03:34.673 --> 03:36.717
and no one claims

03:34.673 --> 03:36.717
to be kidnapped.

03:38.677 --> 03:40.179
You?

03:40.220 --> 03:42.097
License and registration,

03:40.220 --> 03:42.097
please.

03:42.139 --> 03:43.264
What's this all about?

03:43.306 --> 03:44.265
You impeded traffic.

03:44.307 --> 03:46.101
When you pulled out,

03:44.307 --> 03:46.101
that Volkswagen

03:46.143 --> 03:47.061
had to slam on

03:46.143 --> 03:47.061
its brakes.

03:47.102 --> 03:48.187
What Volkswagen?

03:48.228 --> 03:50.064
I looked over to my left

03:48.228 --> 03:50.064
when I pulled out.

03:50.105 --> 03:50.981
There was no car.

03:51.023 --> 03:53.692
License and registration, ma'am.

03:53.734 --> 03:54.860
All right.

03:54.902 --> 03:56.945
Don't think I don't know

03:54.902 --> 03:56.945
what this is all about.

03:56.987 --> 03:59.156
It's 'cause I made you

03:56.987 --> 03:59.156
pay for that ice tea.

03:59.198 --> 04:01.033
Oh, was that you?

04:02.409 --> 04:04.494
Now, you just sit tight.

04:04.536 --> 04:06.997
I got to do some paperwork,

04:04.536 --> 04:06.997
run a computer check.

04:07.039 --> 04:08.207
It may take a little while.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.332
The computer's kind of slow.

04:09.374 --> 04:10.792
Yeah, well,

04:09.374 --> 04:10.792
knock yourself out.

04:10.834 --> 04:12.293
My record is clean.

04:12.335 --> 04:15.923
There is no way I have

04:12.335 --> 04:15.923
16 unpaid parking tickets.

04:15.964 --> 04:17.340
The computer's wrong!

04:17.382 --> 04:20.301
You are not getting

04:17.382 --> 04:20.301
away with this!

04:21.511 --> 04:23.388
Hey, Mom, is this

04:21.511 --> 04:23.388
a bad time to tell you

04:23.430 --> 04:25.390
I got kicked out

04:23.430 --> 04:25.390
out of shop class?

04:25.432 --> 04:27.308
I mean, it seems to pale

04:25.432 --> 04:27.308
in comparison.

04:27.350 --> 04:28.309
CRAIG:

04:27.350 --> 04:28.309
Chin up, Lois.

04:28.351 --> 04:30.311
I'll make sure

04:28.351 --> 04:30.311
the boys get home.

04:30.353 --> 04:32.355
I'll wait for you.

04:32.397 --> 04:34.608
I want you boys

04:32.397 --> 04:34.608
to behave for Craig.

04:34.649 --> 04:37.318
And, Dewey, don't be frightened.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.319
Mama's going to be okay.

04:38.361 --> 04:39.905
Can you turn on

04:38.361 --> 04:39.905
your siren?

04:39.947 --> 04:41.406
Sure.

04:41.448 --> 04:43.033
Yay!

04:43.075 --> 04:44.576
(imitating siren)

04:48.371 --> 04:49.497
Come on, honey.

04:49.539 --> 04:52.375
You got to admit

04:49.539 --> 04:52.375
it was kind of sexy--

04:52.417 --> 04:55.003
me having to bail

04:52.417 --> 04:55.003
you out of jail.

04:56.171 --> 04:57.631
Well, it was sexy for me.

04:57.672 --> 04:59.340
Oh, yeah, Hal,

04:57.672 --> 04:59.340
it was a real turn-on

04:59.382 --> 05:01.635
sitting there wondering

04:59.382 --> 05:01.635
how my children were doing,

05:01.676 --> 05:03.929
what horrible things are going

05:01.676 --> 05:03.929
through their heads

05:03.971 --> 05:06.223
knowing that their mother

05:03.971 --> 05:06.223
is sitting in jail.

05:06.265 --> 05:08.516
Hey, Mom,

05:06.265 --> 05:08.516
did you get tattooed?

05:08.558 --> 05:09.726
I don't understand.

05:09.768 --> 05:12.353
How could we get

05:09.768 --> 05:12.353
16 parking tickets

05:12.395 --> 05:14.355
and not even know about it?

05:14.397 --> 05:16.357
Mom, just calm down!

05:16.399 --> 05:18.026
I was in jail, Francis!

05:16.399 --> 05:18.026
Jail!

05:18.068 --> 05:21.362
All because you didn't pay

05:18.068 --> 05:21.362
your parking tickets!

05:21.404 --> 05:24.532
How could you have gotten

05:21.404 --> 05:24.532
16 parking tickets?!

05:24.574 --> 05:26.367
It's not my fault.

05:24.574 --> 05:26.367
You keep me stuck here.

05:26.409 --> 05:28.369
When I come home,

05:26.409 --> 05:28.369
I have so much living to do,

05:28.411 --> 05:30.205
I don't have time to look

05:28.411 --> 05:30.205
for legal parking.

05:30.247 --> 05:33.374
You listen, mister--

05:30.247 --> 05:33.374
your irresponsible behavior

05:33.416 --> 05:34.751
has finally caught up with you,

05:34.793 --> 05:37.378
and you are going to suffer

05:34.793 --> 05:37.378
the consequences!

05:37.420 --> 05:39.380
You are paying

05:37.420 --> 05:39.380
those parking tickets!

05:39.422 --> 05:41.466
You know, Mom,

05:39.422 --> 05:41.466
jail has really hardened you.

05:41.508 --> 05:43.760
I'm serious, Francis,

05:41.508 --> 05:43.760
you are paying us back

05:43.802 --> 05:45.386
that money for

05:43.802 --> 05:45.386
those tickets

05:45.428 --> 05:47.430
plus $145 to get the car

05:45.428 --> 05:47.430
out of impound.

05:47.472 --> 05:51.226
That means you owe us $747.13.

05:51.268 --> 05:52.435
This is totally unfair!

05:52.477 --> 05:54.395
None of this would have happened

05:54.437 --> 05:56.397
if you weren't

05:54.437 --> 05:56.397
such a reckless driver.

05:56.439 --> 05:57.774
Excuse me?

05:57.816 --> 05:59.442
When I parked too close

05:57.816 --> 05:59.442
to a mailbox,

05:59.484 --> 06:01.236
I didn't endanger

05:59.484 --> 06:01.236
anybody's life.

06:01.278 --> 06:02.403
I didn't endanger anyone.

06:02.445 --> 06:04.405
I was pulled over

06:02.445 --> 06:04.405
by a corrupt cop

06:04.447 --> 06:06.992
for a traffic violation

06:04.447 --> 06:06.992
that I didn't commit.

06:07.034 --> 06:09.661
Oh, but when I tell you

06:07.034 --> 06:09.661
I've been framed by the police,

06:09.703 --> 06:11.330
you send me to military school.

06:11.370 --> 06:12.413
Ironic, isn't it?

06:12.455 --> 06:13.456
That cop was out to get me.

06:13.498 --> 06:14.415
Of course he was.

06:14.457 --> 06:15.583
Everyone's out to get you.

06:15.625 --> 06:17.418
And the neighbor's cat's

06:15.625 --> 06:17.418
the ringleader.

06:17.460 --> 06:18.337
Didn't you know that?

06:18.377 --> 06:21.215
Ha-ha, you can laugh

06:18.377 --> 06:21.215
all you want, Francis,

06:21.256 --> 06:23.424
but until you come

06:21.256 --> 06:23.424
up with the money,

06:23.466 --> 06:24.509
you are not

06:23.466 --> 06:24.509
coming home.

06:24.551 --> 06:26.678
Where am I supposed to get $700?

06:26.720 --> 06:30.015
You're just using this

06:26.720 --> 06:30.015
as an excuse to keep me here.

06:30.057 --> 06:33.101
Yeah, that's right.

06:30.057 --> 06:33.101
It was the cat's idea.

06:33.143 --> 06:34.269
Mom, there's no way

06:34.311 --> 06:36.355
Francis can come up

06:34.311 --> 06:36.355
with that kind of money.

06:37.522 --> 06:40.359
Which is what

06:37.522 --> 06:40.359
he should have thought of

06:40.399 --> 06:43.153
before he did

06:40.399 --> 06:43.153
that bad, bad thing.

06:43.195 --> 06:44.445
Honey, don't worry

06:43.195 --> 06:44.445
about a thing.

06:44.487 --> 06:46.531
Everything's going to be fine.

06:46.573 --> 06:48.116
Francis will think

06:46.573 --> 06:48.116
of something.

06:48.158 --> 06:50.535
I hear they've made

06:48.158 --> 06:50.535
traffic school really fun.

06:50.577 --> 06:52.453
They have cooking

06:50.577 --> 06:52.453
traffic school,

06:52.495 --> 06:53.496
bowling traffic school.

06:53.538 --> 06:55.456
Remember when I took that

06:53.538 --> 06:55.456
comedy traffic school?

06:55.498 --> 06:57.292
I mean, God, that

06:55.498 --> 06:57.292
was hilarious.

06:57.334 --> 07:00.461
A rabbi, a priest

06:57.334 --> 07:00.461
and a minister come

06:57.334 --> 07:00.461
to a four-way stop...

07:00.503 --> 07:02.381
I am not taking

07:00.503 --> 07:02.381
traffic school.

07:03.506 --> 07:04.465
Honey, if you don't

07:03.506 --> 07:04.465
take traffic school,

07:04.507 --> 07:05.884
you'll get a point

07:04.507 --> 07:05.884
on your license.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.552
I'm not getting

07:05.926 --> 07:07.552
a point on my license

07:07.594 --> 07:09.054
because I'm taking this

07:07.594 --> 07:09.054
to court.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.471
I did nothing wrong

07:10.513 --> 07:12.640
and I've got three

07:10.513 --> 07:12.640
eyewitnesses to prove it.

07:12.682 --> 07:14.559
They saw exactly what happened.

07:16.519 --> 07:18.397
Blah, blah, blah.

07:18.479 --> 07:22.025
Blah, blah, blah,

07:18.479 --> 07:22.025
blah, blah, blah.

07:23.568 --> 07:28.489
Quack, quack, quack,

07:23.568 --> 07:28.489
quack, quack, quack.

07:28.531 --> 07:31.326
Quack, quack,

07:28.531 --> 07:31.326
quack, quack, quack, quack.

07:32.619 --> 07:35.122
Dewey, Dewey, Dewey,

07:32.619 --> 07:35.122
Dewey, Dewey, Dewey

07:35.163 --> 07:37.791
Dewey, Dewey, Dewey, Dewey,

07:35.163 --> 07:37.791
Dewey, Dewey.

07:37.832 --> 07:39.293
Exactly

07:37.832 --> 07:39.293
what you said, Mom.

07:39.334 --> 07:40.501
You're right, Mom.

07:39.334 --> 07:40.501
Right.

07:40.543 --> 07:42.545
See, Hal, it's a clear case

07:40.543 --> 07:42.545
of entrapment.

07:42.587 --> 07:44.547
The cop doesn't get

07:42.587 --> 07:44.547
his free ice tea

07:44.589 --> 07:46.507
so he trumps up

07:44.589 --> 07:46.507
a cockamamy ticket.

07:46.549 --> 07:47.759
Well, we're going to fight this.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.594
Well, honey, let's think

07:47.801 --> 07:49.594
about this a second.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.763
You know it's going to be

07:49.636 --> 07:51.763
your word against his,

07:51.805 --> 07:53.681
and judges usually side

07:51.805 --> 07:53.681
with the police.

07:53.723 --> 07:55.016
Yeah, that's what

07:53.723 --> 07:55.016
he's counting on.

07:55.058 --> 07:57.352
That's why he thinks he

07:55.058 --> 07:57.352
can get away with lying.

07:57.394 --> 07:58.519
Well, I'm not

07:57.394 --> 07:58.519
going to let him

07:58.561 --> 07:59.520
'cause I know I'm right.

07:59.562 --> 08:00.563
I know that, honey,

08:00.605 --> 08:02.316
but what if something

08:00.605 --> 08:02.316
does go wrong?

08:02.357 --> 08:03.524
I mean, I'm not sure

08:03.566 --> 08:05.526
we can afford the bump

08:03.566 --> 08:05.526
in the insurance.

08:05.568 --> 08:06.569
I am not going to lose.

08:06.611 --> 08:09.239
I'm in the right

08:06.611 --> 08:09.239
and I'll find a way to prove it.

08:09.281 --> 08:12.742
Okay, okay,

08:09.281 --> 08:12.742
if that's what

08:09.281 --> 08:12.742
you want to do.

08:12.784 --> 08:15.162
You have our total support.

08:15.203 --> 08:18.165
Just remember, Mom,

08:15.203 --> 08:18.165
in a world of lies,

08:18.206 --> 08:20.250
truth is your only weapon.

08:22.377 --> 08:24.254
What? It's not?

08:24.296 --> 08:26.089
Thank you.

08:29.592 --> 08:30.551
Howdy, ma'am.

08:30.593 --> 08:31.552
How was jail?

08:31.594 --> 08:32.595
Fine, thank you.

08:32.637 --> 08:36.475
Shouldn't you be out

08:32.637 --> 08:36.475
planting drugs on someone?

08:36.516 --> 08:38.559
Yes, I was planning

08:36.516 --> 08:38.559
to go do that

08:38.601 --> 08:41.729
right after I pay full

08:38.601 --> 08:41.729
price for my ice tea.

08:41.771 --> 08:44.149
I'm fighting the ticket,

08:41.771 --> 08:44.149
you know.

08:44.191 --> 08:47.027
Well, then, I look forward

08:44.191 --> 08:47.027
to seeing you in court.

08:47.068 --> 08:48.569
Drive safely...

08:48.611 --> 08:51.239
whenever you get

08:48.611 --> 08:51.239
your car back.

08:54.993 --> 08:58.579
There is no way that cop

08:54.993 --> 08:58.579
could have seen me pull out.

08:58.621 --> 08:59.873
(phone rings)

08:59.914 --> 09:01.291
Yeah?

09:01.333 --> 09:02.583
Mom, great news.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.044
Francis, I'm a little busy here.

09:04.085 --> 09:05.212
Okay, here it is.

09:05.253 --> 09:07.881
I just sent you $20

09:05.253 --> 09:07.881
good-faith money...

09:07.922 --> 09:11.176
Great. Only $727 more

09:07.922 --> 09:11.176
before you can come home.

09:11.218 --> 09:12.427
What?

09:12.469 --> 09:13.594
Francis, I am not going

09:12.469 --> 09:13.594
to let you weasel out

09:13.636 --> 09:14.846
of your responsibility.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.473
Because of you,

09:14.888 --> 09:16.473
we are down to one car

09:16.515 --> 09:17.598
until your father's

09:16.515 --> 09:17.598
next paycheck.

09:17.640 --> 09:18.766
Now, you either come up

09:17.640 --> 09:18.766
with the money

09:18.808 --> 09:19.893
or you don't come home.

09:19.934 --> 09:21.853
Mom, it's impossible.

09:19.934 --> 09:21.853
I'm in school.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.855
When I'm not in school,

09:21.895 --> 09:23.855
I have homework.

09:23.897 --> 09:26.233
When I'm not doing homework,

09:23.897 --> 09:26.233
I'm in detention.

09:26.274 --> 09:28.609
If I'm lucky, I have six hours

09:26.274 --> 09:28.609
free a week.

09:28.651 --> 09:30.195
At minimum wage

09:30.237 --> 09:33.407
I wouldn't be able to make it

09:30.237 --> 09:33.407
home until Thanksgiving 2010.

09:33.448 --> 09:34.491
You bring the yams.

09:40.663 --> 09:42.790
He'll find the money.

09:42.832 --> 09:45.835
Hey, do you know

09:42.832 --> 09:45.835
where Craig is?

09:45.877 --> 09:47.504
Your assistant manager?

09:47.546 --> 09:49.256
Big guy, smells like cabbage?

09:49.297 --> 09:51.049
Thanks.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.428
Uh-uh, it's not there.

09:54.469 --> 09:56.012
Keep looking...

09:56.054 --> 09:57.222
Lower...

09:57.264 --> 09:58.639
(chuckles)

09:58.681 --> 10:01.101
Craig, Mom said

09:58.681 --> 10:01.101
you can give me a

09:58.681 --> 10:01.101
ride to study group.

10:01.142 --> 10:03.353
Sure, sure.

10:03.395 --> 10:04.896
What are you doing?

10:04.938 --> 10:07.648
I was, uh, uh, reviewing

10:04.938 --> 10:07.648
some old security tapes.

10:07.690 --> 10:09.650
You know, looking

10:07.690 --> 10:09.650
for a pattern.

10:09.692 --> 10:11.652
See if anyone

10:09.692 --> 10:11.652
was casing the joint.

10:11.694 --> 10:12.862
You can't be too careful.

10:12.904 --> 10:15.156
Hey, that girl's

10:12.904 --> 10:15.156
stealing something.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.659
Oh, I, I didn't notice that.

10:18.701 --> 10:21.871
I'd better review

10:18.701 --> 10:21.871
her other tapes, then.

10:28.711 --> 10:31.590
Wait. Are there cameras

10:28.711 --> 10:31.590
all over this place?

10:31.631 --> 10:33.341
Oh, yeah,

10:31.631 --> 10:33.341
they're everywhere:

10:33.383 --> 10:35.260
pharmacy, ATM, the bath...

10:35.302 --> 10:37.095
Uh, yep, lot of cameras.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.013
Is there one

10:37.137 --> 10:39.013
in the parking lot?

10:40.974 --> 10:41.682
Whoa!

10:41.724 --> 10:42.850
What is it?

10:42.892 --> 10:45.604
That girl dropped a can

10:42.892 --> 10:45.604
under her car.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.021
Sorry.

10:48.607 --> 10:49.566
Wait! Stop!

10:49.608 --> 10:51.776
There's our van.

10:58.533 --> 11:01.286
She did it.

11:01.328 --> 11:03.330
She's guilty.

11:03.371 --> 11:06.916
Mom's... wrong.

11:12.671 --> 11:14.633
Oh, my God.

11:14.673 --> 11:16.009
Mom's wrong.

11:16.050 --> 11:17.885
My whole worldview is shaken.

11:17.927 --> 11:19.720
I know. This is amazing.

11:19.762 --> 11:21.431
We have to go

11:19.762 --> 11:21.431
show it to her.

11:21.473 --> 11:22.807
Wait, maybe we

11:21.473 --> 11:22.807
should save it

11:22.849 --> 11:24.725
for the next time

11:22.849 --> 11:24.725
Mom yells at us,

11:24.767 --> 11:25.893
then spring it on her.

11:25.935 --> 11:27.312
No, I think

11:25.935 --> 11:27.312
it's better fresh.

11:27.354 --> 11:30.649
Okay, let's go.

11:27.354 --> 11:30.649
Wait, we need

11:27.354 --> 11:30.649
to keep a straight face.

11:30.689 --> 11:31.732
Okay, okay.

11:31.774 --> 11:32.733
(breathing deep)

11:32.775 --> 11:33.901
I'm ready.

11:33.943 --> 11:35.736
(giggling):

11:33.943 --> 11:35.736
No, I'm not.

11:35.778 --> 11:36.737
Stop smiling.

11:36.779 --> 11:37.738
(giggling)

11:37.780 --> 11:39.157
Come on...

11:39.199 --> 11:40.741
Hey, honey.

11:40.783 --> 11:42.410
God, it's been

11:40.783 --> 11:42.410
a great day.

11:42.452 --> 11:44.579
The fire alarm went off

11:42.452 --> 11:44.579
during the morning meeting,

11:44.621 --> 11:47.374
and I got the last Snickers

11:44.621 --> 11:47.374
out of the vending machine.

11:48.791 --> 11:50.210
I did not think

11:48.791 --> 11:50.210
it was going to fall,

11:50.251 --> 11:52.753
but then I gave it

11:50.251 --> 11:52.753
a little hip check-- boom!

11:52.795 --> 11:54.297
Who is Susan King?

11:56.090 --> 11:57.467
Hmm?

11:58.801 --> 12:00.261
Susan King.

12:00.303 --> 12:01.762
Hmm, Susan King.

12:01.804 --> 12:03.473
Give me a moment.

12:03.515 --> 12:04.932
Susan...

12:04.974 --> 12:06.226
All right, before

12:04.974 --> 12:06.226
I say anything,

12:06.267 --> 12:08.769
do you know already or

12:06.267 --> 12:08.769
are you really asking?

12:08.811 --> 12:10.146
She called today

12:08.811 --> 12:10.146
with some insurance quotes

12:10.188 --> 12:11.772
in case I get

12:10.188 --> 12:11.772
a point on my license.

12:11.814 --> 12:12.773
Why would she do that?

12:12.815 --> 12:13.774
It was nothing.

12:13.816 --> 12:15.569
I just gave her

12:13.816 --> 12:15.569
a little phone call.

12:15.610 --> 12:16.611
Curious about a few things.

12:16.653 --> 12:17.987
Like what will happen if I lose?

12:18.029 --> 12:20.781
Well, yes, yes, I just

12:18.029 --> 12:20.781
wanted to find out

12:20.823 --> 12:22.867
what the worst-case

12:20.823 --> 12:22.867
scenario might be.

12:22.909 --> 12:24.160
I mean, what if...

12:24.202 --> 12:25.786
There are no "what ifs," Hal!

12:25.828 --> 12:26.787
You're right.

12:26.829 --> 12:28.248
You are right.

12:28.289 --> 12:29.290
Right, okay.

12:29.332 --> 12:30.875
So, I mean, even if our

12:29.332 --> 12:30.875
insurance does go up

12:30.917 --> 12:33.086
and we can't afford two

12:30.917 --> 12:33.086
cars, we'll just sell one.

12:33.127 --> 12:35.796
I mean, you know,

12:33.127 --> 12:35.796
what did they do before cars?

12:35.838 --> 12:37.465
They, uh, they walked,

12:35.838 --> 12:37.465
so we'll walk.

12:37.507 --> 12:38.966
You're expecting me to lose.

12:39.008 --> 12:40.801
Is this how you support me?

12:40.843 --> 12:42.220
I do support you.

12:42.262 --> 12:43.722
I'm just--

12:42.262 --> 12:43.722
I think we need

12:43.762 --> 12:45.806
to know what we're

12:43.762 --> 12:45.806
getting into here.

12:45.848 --> 12:46.807
I mean, I don't know.

12:46.849 --> 12:48.809
Is, is it actually worth

12:46.849 --> 12:48.809
all the trouble?

12:48.851 --> 12:49.977
Yes, Hal.

12:50.019 --> 12:52.230
I think standing up for myself

12:50.019 --> 12:52.230
is worth the trouble!

12:52.272 --> 12:55.525
I think refusing to be

12:52.272 --> 12:55.525
railroaded is worth the trouble!

12:55.567 --> 12:58.403
I know I can win this

12:55.567 --> 12:58.403
because I know I'm right!

12:58.445 --> 13:01.615
I can't believe you have

12:58.445 --> 13:01.615
so little faith in me!

13:01.656 --> 13:02.990
I have complete faith in you.

13:03.032 --> 13:05.660
It's the rest of the world

13:03.032 --> 13:05.660
that I don't have faith in.

13:06.453 --> 13:07.828
Things could look different

13:07.870 --> 13:08.829
to different people.

13:08.871 --> 13:10.248
The system can be corrupt.

13:10.290 --> 13:13.209
We wouldn't be in

13:10.290 --> 13:13.209
this situation if

13:10.290 --> 13:13.209
that weren't true.

13:13.251 --> 13:15.836
And sometimes, Lois,

13:13.251 --> 13:15.836
being right isn't enough.

13:15.878 --> 13:18.839
Being right is everything.

13:18.881 --> 13:20.258
I didn't do

13:18.881 --> 13:20.258
anything wrong, Hal,

13:20.300 --> 13:22.009
and I'm willing to fight

13:20.300 --> 13:22.009
to prove it.

13:22.051 --> 13:23.428
I know it's going to be hard.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.138
But that's why

13:23.470 --> 13:25.138
the last thing I need

13:25.179 --> 13:26.847
is my own family

13:25.179 --> 13:26.847
undermining me.

13:26.889 --> 13:28.849
How many times

13:26.889 --> 13:28.849
do I have to tell you?

13:28.891 --> 13:29.850
I'm right, I'm right.

13:29.892 --> 13:33.396
I swear on my children's lives,

13:29.892 --> 13:33.396
I am right!

13:35.690 --> 13:37.692
What do you want?

13:40.403 --> 13:41.862
Nothing.

13:41.904 --> 13:43.864
I can't believe

13:41.904 --> 13:43.864
you chickened out.

13:43.906 --> 13:45.866
Me? You're the one

13:43.906 --> 13:45.866
who disappeared.

13:45.908 --> 13:47.327
Oh, so now we're

13:45.908 --> 13:47.327
playing the blame game.

13:47.368 --> 13:48.953
Look, we know Mom

13:47.368 --> 13:48.953
is going to freak out

13:48.995 --> 13:50.789
on whoever shows her the tape...

13:50.829 --> 13:52.123
Not it.

13:50.829 --> 13:52.123
Maybe someone could

13:52.165 --> 13:54.875
mail it to her anonymously...

13:54.917 --> 13:57.253
Not it.

13:54.917 --> 13:57.253
Okay, fine,

13:54.917 --> 13:57.253
but I'm going to need...

13:57.295 --> 13:57.878
Not it.

13:57.920 --> 13:58.879
Look...

13:58.921 --> 14:00.340
someone has to be the person...

14:00.381 --> 14:01.882
Not it.

14:00.381 --> 14:01.882
Who doesn't give it to her.

14:01.924 --> 14:02.509
I'm it.

14:02.550 --> 14:03.677
Ha!

14:03.718 --> 14:05.886
Oh.

14:05.928 --> 14:06.887
Let me get this straight:

14:06.929 --> 14:09.056
We each pay you $50

14:06.929 --> 14:09.056
and you're going to jump

14:09.098 --> 14:11.810
from the roof of the dorm

14:09.098 --> 14:11.810
to the roof of the gym

14:11.850 --> 14:13.478
on the school's

14:11.850 --> 14:13.478
riding lawnmower.

14:13.520 --> 14:14.479
Who's in?

14:14.521 --> 14:17.190
Are we talking

14:14.521 --> 14:17.190
with the bagger attachment?

14:17.231 --> 14:18.399
Are you crazy?

14:18.441 --> 14:20.485
You know what kind of drag

14:18.441 --> 14:20.485
that would create?

14:20.527 --> 14:21.402
I don't know.

14:21.444 --> 14:22.903
It just sounds too easy.

14:22.945 --> 14:24.572
Okay, okay, how about this:

14:24.614 --> 14:28.535
For five extra dollars,

14:24.614 --> 14:28.535
I'll do it blindfolded.

14:28.576 --> 14:29.994
Francis, phone.

14:30.036 --> 14:31.788
Give it some thought.

14:32.831 --> 14:33.914
Hello?

14:33.956 --> 14:34.915
Hey, Francis.

14:34.957 --> 14:36.543
You know Mom's traffic ticket?

14:36.584 --> 14:37.918
Well, I have a videotape,

14:37.960 --> 14:39.920
and it shows that Mom

14:37.960 --> 14:39.920
really was at fault, and...

14:39.962 --> 14:41.922
She was wrong?

14:41.964 --> 14:43.216
Yeah, and now

14:41.964 --> 14:43.216
I'm trying to figure...

14:43.257 --> 14:44.718
What are you talking to me for?

14:44.759 --> 14:46.927
You have incontrovertible proof

14:44.759 --> 14:46.927
that Mom was wrong.

14:46.969 --> 14:48.596
Shove it in her face.

14:48.638 --> 14:51.725
Francis, I don't think

14:48.638 --> 14:51.725
that's a good idea.

14:51.766 --> 14:53.226
Are you kidding?

14:51.766 --> 14:53.226
It's brilliant.

14:53.267 --> 14:55.102
From now on, whenever she gets

14:53.267 --> 14:55.102
all high-and-mighty with us,

14:55.144 --> 14:56.771
we can just

14:55.144 --> 14:56.771
throw this back at her.

14:56.813 --> 14:57.980
Francis, I can't.

14:58.022 --> 15:00.191
If I show Mom this tape,

14:58.022 --> 15:00.191
she'll go crazy

15:00.233 --> 15:03.236
and then she'll kill

15:00.233 --> 15:03.236
the messenger, which is  me.

15:03.277 --> 15:05.530
You're asking me

15:03.277 --> 15:05.530
to commit suicide.

15:05.572 --> 15:08.157
And think of

15:05.572 --> 15:08.157
the look on her face!

15:13.996 --> 15:17.458
We thought it would be best

15:13.996 --> 15:17.458
if we showed it to you first.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.460
Well, I can't say

15:17.500 --> 15:19.460
that I'm glad you did,

15:19.502 --> 15:21.962
but I-I guess you did

15:19.502 --> 15:21.962
the right thing.

15:22.004 --> 15:22.963
Someone should

15:22.004 --> 15:22.963
show it to her.

15:23.005 --> 15:24.465
Not it.

15:23.005 --> 15:24.465
Dad!

15:24.507 --> 15:27.844
Okay, but we need

15:24.507 --> 15:27.844
to ease her into this.

15:27.886 --> 15:29.679
Pick the right moment.

15:29.721 --> 15:32.973
This is a very delicate matter.

15:33.015 --> 15:34.058
LOIS:

15:33.015 --> 15:34.058
Hal!

15:34.100 --> 15:36.394
Come on, come on, come on,

15:34.100 --> 15:36.394
come on...

15:38.020 --> 15:39.689
(door closes)

15:39.731 --> 15:41.023
LOIS:

15:39.731 --> 15:41.023
I swear, that cop

15:41.065 --> 15:43.401
was following me

15:41.065 --> 15:43.401
on the way home.

15:43.443 --> 15:44.277
Oh, come on, Lois.

15:44.318 --> 15:46.195
I don't think

15:44.318 --> 15:46.195
he'd follow you.

15:46.237 --> 15:48.907
I'm sure he's got

15:46.237 --> 15:48.907
better things to do.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.408
(doorbell rings)

15:52.034 --> 15:54.704
What do you think

15:52.034 --> 15:54.704
you're doing here?

15:54.746 --> 15:55.996
My commander informed me

15:56.038 --> 15:57.916
that you made a request

15:56.038 --> 15:57.916
for my records,

15:57.957 --> 16:00.000
which, of course,

15:57.957 --> 16:00.000
is your right,

16:00.042 --> 16:01.711
so I thought

16:00.042 --> 16:01.711
I'd take a drive over

16:01.753 --> 16:03.838
and deliver them

16:01.753 --> 16:03.838
to you myself.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.005
Nice house.

16:05.047 --> 16:07.216
Don't you try to intimidate me.

16:07.258 --> 16:09.510
All I said was

16:07.258 --> 16:09.510
you have a nice house.

16:09.552 --> 16:12.012
First you follow me home and

16:09.552 --> 16:12.012
now you're making vague threats?

16:12.054 --> 16:13.389
Well, it's not going to work.

16:13.431 --> 16:15.725
You are going to be so sorry

16:13.431 --> 16:15.725
you messed with me.

16:16.893 --> 16:18.018
Have a nice evening, ma'am.

16:18.060 --> 16:20.020
You are going down, mister.

16:20.062 --> 16:21.230
You hear me?!

16:21.272 --> 16:22.816
You are going down!

16:22.857 --> 16:26.026
I don't care how long it takes

16:22.857 --> 16:26.026
or how much money it costs!

16:26.068 --> 16:29.572
I'm going to win

16:26.068 --> 16:29.572
because I am right!

16:34.076 --> 16:37.580
There's something

16:34.076 --> 16:37.580
you have to see.

16:43.085 --> 16:46.464
Honey, I'm sorry

16:43.085 --> 16:46.464
you had to see that,

16:46.506 --> 16:49.801
but it's best you found out now

16:46.506 --> 16:49.801
before it's too late.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.848
It's wrong.

16:54.889 --> 16:55.849
What?

16:55.890 --> 16:57.517
The tape is wrong.

16:59.602 --> 17:00.895
Dad...

17:00.937 --> 17:02.856
You heard your mother.

17:02.897 --> 17:07.276
The tape... is...

17:09.737 --> 17:10.780
Oh, man!

17:15.034 --> 17:16.076
Honey...

17:16.118 --> 17:18.078
Look, I'm not stupid.

17:18.120 --> 17:20.080
I saw the tape.

17:20.122 --> 17:21.165
But it's wrong.

17:21.207 --> 17:24.084
I don't know how

17:21.207 --> 17:24.084
to explain it, but I know.

17:24.126 --> 17:27.087
I know that tape is wrong.

17:27.129 --> 17:29.883
I believe you.

17:27.129 --> 17:29.883
No, you don't.

17:29.924 --> 17:30.884
Well, what do you expect?

17:30.925 --> 17:33.135
I expect you to believe me.

17:33.177 --> 17:34.345
Lois, in the past 20 years

17:34.387 --> 17:36.389
you have never admitted

17:34.387 --> 17:36.389
that you were wrong.

17:36.430 --> 17:38.766
And as far as I know,

17:36.430 --> 17:38.766
you've never needed to.

17:38.808 --> 17:41.728
But the facts are right there

17:38.808 --> 17:41.728
in front of your eyes,

17:41.769 --> 17:43.103
and this time you are wrong.

17:43.145 --> 17:45.147
And if you can't see that,

17:45.189 --> 17:47.107
well, that's just plain crazy.

17:47.149 --> 17:48.108
I am not crazy.

17:48.150 --> 17:50.486
The tape is wrong.

17:48.150 --> 17:50.486
It has to be.

17:50.528 --> 17:53.031
Well, wha-what are you saying,

17:50.528 --> 17:53.031
that someone doctored it?

17:53.072 --> 17:54.198
No, I...

17:55.366 --> 17:57.410
I, I-I know... I know

17:55.366 --> 17:57.410
it wasn't doctored.

17:57.451 --> 17:59.203
I'm just saying

17:57.451 --> 17:59.203
that it's wrong.

17:59.245 --> 18:02.122
I know what happened,

17:59.245 --> 18:02.122
and I know that I'm right.

18:02.164 --> 18:03.583
Okay, honey, that may be,

18:03.624 --> 18:06.419
but me and the rest

18:03.624 --> 18:06.419
of the world tend to

18:03.624 --> 18:06.419
believe what we see,

18:06.460 --> 18:09.714
and everything is pointing

18:06.460 --> 18:09.714
to you being wrong.

18:09.756 --> 18:13.133
The universe

18:09.756 --> 18:13.133
is telling you

18:09.756 --> 18:13.133
to give up.

18:13.175 --> 18:15.135
It's time to let it go.

18:19.057 --> 18:22.602
Well, that's not fair.

18:26.188 --> 18:28.148
You know what's

18:26.188 --> 18:28.148
not fair, Lois?

18:28.190 --> 18:30.317
Having to be right

18:28.190 --> 18:30.317
all the time.

18:30.359 --> 18:32.152
That's a terrible burden.

18:32.194 --> 18:35.073
Wouldn't it be a relief

18:35.114 --> 18:36.657
just to let go?

18:38.576 --> 18:40.954
You want me to say

18:38.576 --> 18:40.954
that I'm wrong

18:40.995 --> 18:42.455
even when I know I'm right?

18:42.496 --> 18:45.083
Yes, yes, that's

18:42.496 --> 18:45.083
exactly what I want.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.166
I know

18:46.208 --> 18:47.543
it doesn't happen

18:46.208 --> 18:47.543
very often, Lois,

18:47.585 --> 18:51.798
but you have been beaten.

18:51.839 --> 18:53.091
Let go.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.009
But I am right.

18:55.051 --> 18:56.176
Let go, honey.

18:55.051 --> 18:56.176
But I...

18:56.218 --> 18:57.887
Just once.

18:57.929 --> 18:59.055
Can you do that?

18:59.097 --> 19:01.015
Let go.

19:06.604 --> 19:07.688
That's it.

19:07.730 --> 19:09.189
Aw, see?

19:09.231 --> 19:10.775
Okay...

19:10.817 --> 19:13.778
Okay, can you say it?

19:13.820 --> 19:16.196
(sighs)

19:18.116 --> 19:21.702
I was...

19:21.744 --> 19:23.203
wrong.

19:23.245 --> 19:25.123
That's right.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.207
You see, it's not so bad.

19:27.249 --> 19:28.584
Hmm?

19:28.626 --> 19:31.211
You'll go to traffic school

19:31.253 --> 19:33.255
and meet some nice people,

19:33.297 --> 19:35.215
maybe hear a couple

19:33.297 --> 19:35.215
good car jokes.

19:35.257 --> 19:36.717
(laughs)

19:35.257 --> 19:36.717
Huh?

19:36.759 --> 19:38.218
Everything is...

19:38.260 --> 19:40.429
Everything's going to be

19:38.260 --> 19:40.429
all right, okay?

19:40.471 --> 19:42.515
Everything's going

19:40.471 --> 19:42.515
to be all right.

19:42.556 --> 19:45.143
Oh, I am so proud of you.

19:46.769 --> 19:49.229
You are so great.

19:49.271 --> 19:52.150
You are so beautiful.

19:52.191 --> 19:55.528
You are so wrong.

19:57.279 --> 19:59.281
How many times

19:57.279 --> 19:59.281
have I told you people

19:59.323 --> 20:01.241
don't leave

19:59.323 --> 20:01.241
the refrigerator open!

20:01.283 --> 20:02.702
You did it.

20:02.743 --> 20:05.121
Maybe I did.

20:05.163 --> 20:07.540
She's been like

20:05.163 --> 20:07.540
this all week.

20:07.581 --> 20:09.959
It's like her spirit's

20:07.581 --> 20:09.959
been broken.

20:10.001 --> 20:11.460
It's nice.

20:11.502 --> 20:13.253
Hi, Francis-- about the money...

20:13.295 --> 20:16.256
Okay, look, I've raised

20:13.295 --> 20:16.256
192 bucks, and if I can only...

20:16.298 --> 20:17.758
Look, Francis,

20:16.298 --> 20:17.758
I'm sorry I got so angry.

20:17.800 --> 20:20.761
Why don't you just use that

20:17.800 --> 20:20.761
money to come home next weekend?

20:20.803 --> 20:22.096
But...

20:22.138 --> 20:24.390
I've got to go to traffic

20:22.138 --> 20:24.390
school. Love you. Bye.

20:28.811 --> 20:30.855
Bye.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.439
(banging)

20:32.481 --> 20:33.900
Where's Lois,

20:32.481 --> 20:33.900
did I miss her?

20:33.941 --> 20:35.275
Craig.

20:35.317 --> 20:37.528
You guys are not going

20:35.317 --> 20:37.528
to believe what I have.

20:37.570 --> 20:38.571
I have a surveillance

20:38.612 --> 20:39.780
arrangement with the manager

20:39.822 --> 20:41.365
of the mini-mart

20:39.822 --> 20:41.365
across the street.

20:41.407 --> 20:43.450
We exchange tapes

20:41.407 --> 20:43.450
in order to better understand

20:43.492 --> 20:45.285
the security needs

20:43.492 --> 20:45.285
of our customers.

20:45.327 --> 20:47.287
"Short skirt, windy day"?

20:47.329 --> 20:48.539
That's code.

20:48.581 --> 20:50.290
Anyhoo, one of

20:48.581 --> 20:50.290
their cameras

20:50.332 --> 20:52.168
caught Lois

20:50.332 --> 20:52.168
from a different angle

20:52.210 --> 20:53.920
right before she got her ticket.

21:05.139 --> 21:06.306
See?

21:06.348 --> 21:08.601
Lois was right

21:06.348 --> 21:08.601
all along!

21:08.642 --> 21:10.228
This completely exonerates her.

21:10.269 --> 21:11.437
Isn't this great?

21:20.238 --> 21:22.198
What are you doing?

21:27.369 --> 21:30.581
You will never, ever

21:27.369 --> 21:30.581
tell her of this.

21:30.623 --> 21:31.331
But...

21:31.373 --> 21:33.000
Ah! Ever.

21:35.753 --> 21:37.337
Got it?
