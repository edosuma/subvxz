00:00.001 --> 00:02.668
- You have
a collect call from...

00:02.670 --> 00:04.436
- Ross Patterson.

00:04.438 --> 00:07.573
- An inmate
at street justice films.

00:15.582 --> 00:17.316
- Alright, so no shit.

00:17.318 --> 00:18.784
There I was, on
this train to Paris.

00:18.786 --> 00:21.053
- Will you shut the fuck up?

00:21.055 --> 00:22.755
Shut the fuck up!

00:24.291 --> 00:25.190
Shut the fuck up.

00:25.192 --> 00:26.558
Shut the fuck up!

00:27.494 --> 00:29.762
Everybody knows, okay?

00:29.764 --> 00:31.597
Alright, here's to master
chief bill wizeniski

00:31.599 --> 00:33.465
and Zack kunkle.

00:33.467 --> 00:35.734
- Every person
in the military says,

00:35.736 --> 00:38.637
they day I get out, I'm
gonna party like it's the end

00:38.639 --> 00:40.339
of the world.

00:52.619 --> 00:54.386
- Good afternoon, Mr. best,

00:54.388 --> 00:56.221
I'm gonna be your
public defender.

00:56.223 --> 00:59.558
Seeing as how your actual
lawyer said and I quote,

00:59.560 --> 01:01.093
"fuck him, let him
stay in there."

01:01.095 --> 01:03.729
So, the court assigned
me to represent you.

01:03.731 --> 01:05.664
Do you know what you've
been charged with

01:05.666 --> 01:07.266
or are you too
drunk to remember?

01:07.268 --> 01:10.702
- I was gonna have to hit
the refresh button, my man.

01:10.704 --> 01:11.704
- Yeah.

01:13.406 --> 01:16.375
How bout public intoxication?

01:16.377 --> 01:19.378
- Do it, do it, do it, do it.

01:24.651 --> 01:26.251
- Mat, don't fucking do it.

01:27.221 --> 01:28.587
- Bro, he's gonna fucking do it.

01:31.158 --> 01:32.658
- I'm gonna live forever!

01:35.262 --> 01:37.129
- Fuck, not again.

01:37.131 --> 01:38.797
- What the fuck man?

01:38.799 --> 01:40.365
- Matt, give him
an r4 trauma bag,

01:40.367 --> 01:42.234
it looks like he's got
a sucking ass wound.

01:48.109 --> 01:49.575
- Nice shot!

01:51.177 --> 01:52.845
- Disorderly conduct.

01:53.880 --> 01:55.414
- Don't fucking do it!

01:55.416 --> 01:56.815
- Freedom to fuck off!

01:59.220 --> 02:00.220
Yes, yes!

02:02.789 --> 02:04.156
- Indecency.

02:06.494 --> 02:07.426
- Bro.

02:07.428 --> 02:08.693
- I know.

02:08.696 --> 02:10.461
He's gonna fucking do it.

02:10.464 --> 02:11.630
- Hey, this taking lead?

02:11.632 --> 02:13.899
- Hey, hey, watch the prius.

02:13.901 --> 02:16.668
- Oh, I just Lance
armstronged your prius.

02:16.670 --> 02:17.910
That means I lost a ball in it.

02:19.240 --> 02:20.906
- I bet your corp
watches the view.

02:20.908 --> 02:21.908
Bro.

02:25.246 --> 02:27.346
No, but really I bet
it gets good mileage.

02:27.348 --> 02:28.348
- What?

02:30.151 --> 02:31.151
- Battery.

02:31.818 --> 02:32.818
- Oh shit.

02:34.821 --> 02:37.723
I fucking punched
kesha last night.

02:37.725 --> 02:40.192
I know this is gonna sound crazy

02:40.194 --> 02:42.661
but I fucking love your music.

02:43.830 --> 02:45.631
- Then show me, mat.

02:52.473 --> 02:54.473
- You know that's a
fucking dude, right?

02:54.475 --> 02:55.340
- What?

02:55.342 --> 02:56.475
- That's a fucking dude.

02:56.477 --> 02:57.743
- Fuck.

02:57.745 --> 02:59.478
- Why you have to
ruin all the fun?

02:59.480 --> 03:01.680
- Yeah, why do you have
to ruin all the fun?

03:01.682 --> 03:04.349
- Fuck.

03:04.351 --> 03:06.885
- Henry kesha,
duluth, Minnesota.

03:06.887 --> 03:09.755
This is why you're also being
charged with a hate crime.

03:12.626 --> 03:15.360
And that carries with
it a class a felony.

03:15.362 --> 03:18.664
You normally get it reduced
to class c misdemeanor,

03:18.666 --> 03:20.832
I'd have to the court
that you were homosexual,

03:20.834 --> 03:23.569
which isn't much of a lie
based on your sexual advances

03:23.571 --> 03:24.571
from last night.

03:26.941 --> 03:28.774
- I'll take the felony, brother.

03:28.776 --> 03:31.310
- Too late, I've already
plea bargained for it.

03:31.312 --> 03:32.244
You'll be out of here at 9 am.

03:32.246 --> 03:33.406
It will count as time served.

03:34.982 --> 03:39.251
Tell us you just got
out of the service.

03:39.253 --> 03:42.554
See a lot of guys
coming through here.

03:42.556 --> 03:46.225
Word of advice, find
your next objectives.

03:47.660 --> 03:49.261
Something you can live for.

03:49.263 --> 03:50.896
Choose a new goal to achieve,

03:50.898 --> 03:52.497
learn from your
time in the army.

03:52.499 --> 03:55.667
Don't let it dictate the
entire rest of your life.

03:55.669 --> 03:57.402
- I got a plan.

03:57.404 --> 03:59.838
I'm gonna get out, make
some Internet videos,

03:59.840 --> 04:02.541
get famous and probably
make a movie one day.

04:02.543 --> 04:04.710
- Good luck making
a movie out of that.

04:04.712 --> 04:06.311
Next thing you'll tell
me is you're making

04:06.313 --> 04:08.380
t-shirts for vets and
selling them online

04:08.382 --> 04:09.248
out of your bedroom.

04:09.250 --> 04:10.250
- Actually.

05:46.346 --> 05:49.915
- Alright
young man, here you go.

05:49.917 --> 05:54.353
Hold on, you ain't going
nowhere without me.

05:54.355 --> 05:55.087
You know...
- by the way,

05:55.089 --> 05:55.921
how's your youngest daughter?

05:55.923 --> 05:56.855
I heard she's turned 18.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.423
- She's doing fine.

05:58.425 --> 06:00.058
She's doing even better
without you around.

06:00.060 --> 06:00.926
- Fuck you, bitch!

06:00.928 --> 06:01.928
- Shut up!

06:02.895 --> 06:05.864
Aww, it's good to
see you again, mat.

06:05.866 --> 06:06.798
Sarcasm.

06:06.800 --> 06:07.999
- You too, wilfred brimley.

06:08.001 --> 06:08.867
- Huh?

06:08.869 --> 06:10.469
- Got you too huh?

06:10.471 --> 06:11.803
- Fucking
arrested all of us, bro.

06:11.805 --> 06:13.905
- I'm sure you're all innocent.

06:13.907 --> 06:15.607
Try not to fuck
each other in there,

06:15.609 --> 06:16.942
it makes a mess.

06:20.547 --> 06:22.581
- Oh bravo, Mr. best.

06:22.583 --> 06:24.149
You know how long it's
been since I've been locked

06:24.151 --> 06:25.784
up in prison?

06:25.786 --> 06:27.853
Let me see, carry the two,

06:27.855 --> 06:29.821
that's right, my
whole fucking life!

06:29.823 --> 06:30.956
- Fuck you!

06:30.958 --> 06:32.391
How was I supposed
to know that...

06:32.393 --> 06:35.861
- kesha, Henry
kesha, you made bail.

06:38.531 --> 06:41.466
- Call me if you want
to party and shit.

06:41.468 --> 06:43.602
Your love's my drug, bro.

06:44.737 --> 06:48.039
- Yet another great
night for Mr. best.

06:50.944 --> 06:51.944
Let's go.

06:53.112 --> 06:54.045
- Hey mat.

06:54.047 --> 06:55.147
- Holy shit Jack, what's up?

06:55.149 --> 06:57.182
- Not much, same old shit.

06:57.184 --> 06:58.850
- Wait, you weren't even
at my party last night,

06:58.852 --> 06:59.852
were you?

07:00.654 --> 07:02.721
No, I got arrested on the way.

07:02.723 --> 07:04.122
- So, we gonna...

07:05.124 --> 07:06.491
We gonna talk about this?

07:06.493 --> 07:09.027
- This, I was just
fucking around.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.629
- I can see that.

07:10.631 --> 07:12.898
- Some wise ass filled
her box full of epoxy.

07:12.900 --> 07:15.467
I went to Wal-Mart
to get the removal

07:15.469 --> 07:16.935
and they arrested me.

07:16.937 --> 07:19.938
- Did you know it epoxy in
it before you fucked it?

07:19.940 --> 07:22.741
- I had my suspicions but
everything speculation

07:22.743 --> 07:24.576
till ya to jam
your dick into it.

07:24.578 --> 07:26.178
- Here's what isn't speculation.

07:26.180 --> 07:28.980
If gene vandenham were here
last night instead of you,

07:28.982 --> 07:30.615
we wouldn't fucking be here.

07:30.617 --> 07:33.018
- Actually, this is exactly
where I thought we'd end up.

07:33.020 --> 07:35.454
- Fuck gene and fuck
you for bringing him up

07:35.456 --> 07:35.454
and why is Rocco in the hallway?

07:35.456 --> 07:39.157
- We told the guards that he
takes prison rules seriously.

07:39.159 --> 07:40.125
- What the fuck bro!

07:40.127 --> 07:41.167
I ain't gonna fuck anyone.

07:43.464 --> 07:45.163
- Oh sweet, we can
play who's in my mouth.

07:45.165 --> 07:46.631
- No, fair, I'm out here.

07:48.502 --> 07:52.037
- Jack, stop fucking the doll.

07:52.039 --> 07:53.705
- Just hang in there
boys, there's something going

07:53.707 --> 07:54.707
on outside.

07:55.908 --> 07:57.876
Stay right where
you are, alright?

07:57.878 --> 07:57.876
- Fuck this.

07:57.878 --> 08:00.245
Rocco, can you get out
of those handcuffs?

08:00.247 --> 08:01.780
- Bro, you know how
fucking big I am?

08:07.588 --> 08:08.708
- Oh, what the fuck is that?

08:09.656 --> 08:11.723
- Rocco, check your six.

08:14.695 --> 08:15.695
- Hell yeah!

08:16.630 --> 08:17.662
- Fucking killed man.

08:18.799 --> 08:20.866
- Told you, big as fuck.

08:21.734 --> 08:22.801
- Alright, let's let us out man.

08:22.803 --> 08:23.803
- Yeah.

08:24.670 --> 08:25.837
- Jesus, Rocco.

08:25.839 --> 08:27.672
You just t-boned him
with a metal pole?

08:27.674 --> 08:28.607
- What do you want me to do?

08:28.609 --> 08:29.541
Glue him to my fucking dick?

08:29.543 --> 08:31.676
- Is that what I think it is?

08:31.678 --> 08:34.946
- Boys, I think our wildest
dreams just came true.

08:34.948 --> 08:38.616
The mother fucking
zombie apocalypse!

08:42.923 --> 08:45.724
Sweet fucker of the mother.

08:45.726 --> 08:47.826
- Holy shit, isn't
this fucking awesome?

08:47.828 --> 08:49.227
- It's Marcus luttrell!

08:49.229 --> 08:51.830
- For a second, I thought
you were mark whalberg.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.265
- No, the little fucker
only played me on TV.

08:53.267 --> 08:55.567
- Stop embarrassing me
in front of my friends.

08:55.569 --> 08:56.835
- Bro, it's so fucking
good you're here, man.

08:56.837 --> 08:58.236
- I know.

08:58.238 --> 08:59.070
Hey, you guys have been
saving my ass so many times,

08:59.072 --> 08:59.905
I'm gonna do it for you.

08:59.907 --> 09:00.972
Come on, stack on me,

09:00.974 --> 09:02.541
let's get your frogman up.

09:02.543 --> 09:04.843
Don't worry about a thing!

09:08.215 --> 09:11.082
Hey mother fuckers,
you want some of me?

09:11.084 --> 09:12.717
- That was a short book.

09:12.719 --> 09:14.719
- This is how I'm gonna die?

09:14.721 --> 09:17.122
- Looks like we're the
lone survivors now.

09:21.762 --> 09:23.295
- Alright boys, bring it in.

09:23.297 --> 09:25.263
- Are you about to go
full officer speech?

09:25.265 --> 09:26.164
- What?

09:26.166 --> 09:27.732
No, of course not.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.100
- It's confirmed
we're facing some type

09:29.102 --> 09:30.769
of zombie apocalypse outside.

09:30.771 --> 09:31.970
- Are you sure?

09:31.972 --> 09:33.305
- Try to stay with
me, simple Jack,

09:33.307 --> 09:35.774
but judging from our boy here.

09:35.776 --> 09:37.242
Looks like a blow to
the head takes them out.

09:37.244 --> 09:39.144
- That sounds like pretty
standard zombie rules to me.

09:39.146 --> 09:40.845
- Now, did anybody see
any weapons laying around?

09:40.847 --> 09:41.980
- They have some
Billy clubs over there

09:41.982 --> 09:42.814
and someone else
chained to the bench.

09:42.816 --> 09:43.715
- Billy clubs it is.

09:43.717 --> 09:43.715
What about a vehicle?

09:43.717 --> 09:46.785
- The bar is at least
15 miles from here.

09:46.787 --> 09:48.587
We're better off hitting
the pd impound lot.

09:48.589 --> 09:49.654
- Yeah, there's some guns
and shit over there too.

09:49.656 --> 09:50.822
- Alright, what's the distance?

09:50.824 --> 09:51.756
- From here?

09:51.758 --> 09:52.891
Two, maybe two and a half miles.

09:52.893 --> 09:54.159
- Ah shit, that's far.

09:54.161 --> 09:55.894
- Aright, let's maintain
360 degrees of security.

09:55.896 --> 09:57.816
Stay tight, we don't need
to take it in the rear.

09:58.599 --> 09:59.264
- Like your mom?

09:59.266 --> 10:00.266
- That's what she said.

10:01.201 --> 10:02.233
- It's time to vandanham up.

10:02.235 --> 10:03.168
- Yeah.

10:03.170 --> 10:03.168
- If you speak his name again,

10:03.170 --> 10:06.805
I will slap you and your
mothers delicious fucking mouth.

10:06.807 --> 10:08.206
- Somebodies jealous.

10:08.208 --> 10:10.141
- He's right man, I actually
kinda like that guy.

10:10.143 --> 10:11.676
- Come on, even
his lifetime movie

10:11.678 --> 10:12.877
was fucking awesome.

10:12.879 --> 10:14.346
I can't believed
he played himself.

10:26.192 --> 10:28.693
- Hey gene, welcome home.

10:32.798 --> 10:34.666
- Gene, you're alive.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.003
- That fucking guys not.

10:38.005 --> 10:39.971
- They said your entire
unit died on the news.

10:42.142 --> 10:46.244
- This my entire
unit, right here.

10:46.246 --> 10:49.781
- Oh my god, it's been so hard.

10:49.783 --> 10:51.282
Oh it's really hard

10:52.852 --> 10:54.352
and so big.

11:06.999 --> 11:08.967
- A soldier came home!

11:08.969 --> 11:10.769
A soldier came home!

11:15.375 --> 11:18.309
- The 27 minute sex
scene was a bit much.

11:18.311 --> 11:19.778
- I thought it was tasteful.

11:19.780 --> 11:21.012
- I had to jerk off twice.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.981
- The only boner
i have right now

11:22.983 --> 11:25.116
is for killing zombies.

11:25.118 --> 11:26.317
You fucking ready?

11:26.319 --> 11:27.385
Let's roll.

12:06.926 --> 12:08.259
- Shit, you alright man?

12:08.261 --> 12:09.961
- I think I'm hurt really bad.

12:09.963 --> 12:11.162
Don't worry about me,

12:11.164 --> 12:12.897
my ranger training
will get me through.

12:12.899 --> 12:13.932
- That's the spirit bro,

12:13.934 --> 12:14.899
were you in bat?

12:14.901 --> 12:16.167
- Not anymore, I'm in delta

12:16.169 --> 12:17.736
but I was in 4th battalion.

12:17.738 --> 12:19.170
Just want to get
back to men, sarge.

12:19.172 --> 12:20.171
- 4th battalion?

12:20.173 --> 12:21.272
Bro, there's only three.

12:21.274 --> 12:22.474
- I was special force.

12:22.476 --> 12:24.008
I mean...

12:24.010 --> 12:25.143
A top secret!

12:26.045 --> 12:27.345
- Wait, I know this guy.

12:27.347 --> 12:28.313
- What?

12:28.315 --> 12:29.781
- He's not in the military,

12:29.783 --> 12:32.951
he's an air-softer
that works at the dmv.

12:32.953 --> 12:36.187
- Fuck stolen valor
and fuck the dmv!

12:38.859 --> 12:40.191
- You mother fucker!

12:40.193 --> 12:41.392
Piece of shit.

12:42.394 --> 12:43.928
Bitches get bit.

12:46.466 --> 12:47.899
- Hey guys, get over here.

12:47.901 --> 12:49.033
- What?

12:52.938 --> 12:53.938
- Range 15.

12:54.907 --> 12:57.542
You have to get to range 15.

12:57.544 --> 12:59.077
- What's range 15?

13:01.815 --> 13:03.281
- Let's keep moving
and stick together.

13:03.283 --> 13:06.050
Jack, you're already
doing a good job of that.

13:06.052 --> 13:07.052
- Yeah.

13:12.993 --> 13:14.092
- Want to get wet?

13:14.094 --> 13:15.894
I haven't turned
all the way yet.

13:15.896 --> 13:18.096
- Looks just like a girl
i used to fuck in college

13:18.098 --> 13:19.063
- Rocco.

13:19.065 --> 13:20.565
- That's disgusting.

13:20.567 --> 13:21.833
- Alright, alright.

13:21.835 --> 13:22.835
- No.

13:32.845 --> 13:34.145
Is there anyone in there?

13:34.147 --> 13:35.413
We're not infected.

13:35.415 --> 13:36.981
- Move it along, shit necks.

13:36.983 --> 13:38.516
There's nothing here for you.

13:38.518 --> 13:40.251
- Whoa.

13:40.253 --> 13:41.319
- Please just let us in,

13:41.321 --> 13:42.487
we're survivors.

13:42.489 --> 13:43.454
We just killed a
shit ton of zombies.

13:43.456 --> 13:44.322
- Oh, did you?

13:44.324 --> 13:46.591
Cool story, so did we.

13:46.593 --> 13:49.194
Look guys, we're just
trying to say alive, okay?

13:49.196 --> 13:50.929
We let you and
Mexican Jay leno in,

13:50.931 --> 13:52.163
you'll steal all of our ammo.

13:53.133 --> 13:53.131
- Why would you say that?

13:53.133 --> 13:55.967
- Listen, I'm not gonna
give a gun to his chin,

13:55.969 --> 13:57.869
if you just let us
have a few weapons,

13:57.871 --> 14:01.472
maybe a car, we'll be out
of your beautiful hair.

14:01.474 --> 14:03.942
- Wait, are you mat best?

14:03.944 --> 14:06.211
- Every last inch.

14:06.213 --> 14:07.412
- We totally fucked last week.

14:07.414 --> 14:09.214
- Of course you did.

14:09.216 --> 14:10.248
- Sorry, what's up Eli?

14:10.250 --> 14:11.382
- It's Eliza.

14:12.451 --> 14:14.919
- Can we rekindle
this romance inside?

14:14.921 --> 14:15.854
- Hang on.

14:15.856 --> 14:19.090
- Oh my god, it's so big it
wouldn't even go all the way in.

14:19.092 --> 14:20.892
- Eliza, the beard
and that tattoo,

14:20.894 --> 14:21.926
what did I tell you?

14:21.928 --> 14:24.295
- I love douche bags.

14:24.297 --> 14:25.964
- Alright, fine.

14:25.966 --> 14:27.565
We'll open the door.

14:27.567 --> 14:32.170
- Alright, spread those
cheeks, I'm going in.

14:38.477 --> 14:40.445
- Hello,
this is Robert mcwilliams

14:40.447 --> 14:41.946
with federal resources.

14:41.948 --> 14:43.481
The bureau of civil
defense has issued

14:43.483 --> 14:44.883
an national warning.

14:44.885 --> 14:46.885
A disease of unknown
origin has spread

14:46.887 --> 14:48.186
to pandemic levels.

14:48.188 --> 14:49.587
There is no information...

14:49.589 --> 14:50.922
- Uh, fellas?

14:52.091 --> 14:53.324
Unlock me.

14:53.326 --> 14:55.460
- Oh shit, Evan, what
the hell are you doing

14:55.462 --> 14:57.428
chained up in the police armory?

14:57.430 --> 14:59.330
- Cruised over here
to grab some gats,

14:59.332 --> 15:02.200
when these fucking dirty
sluts rolled me up.

15:02.202 --> 15:04.302
- This little
hipster looking fuck,

15:04.304 --> 15:05.603
wouldn't share any weapons

15:05.605 --> 15:07.105
and I had to cuff him.

15:07.107 --> 15:09.340
- I love the way
your mouth speaks.

15:09.342 --> 15:11.209
- What the fuck is that?

15:11.211 --> 15:12.410
- Oh that.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.412
It's what they call
the grunt pyle.

15:14.414 --> 15:18.616
- It literally looks like
seven men scissoring.

15:18.618 --> 15:20.318
- That's exactly what it is.

15:22.155 --> 15:23.955
- I know I'm stating
the obvious here

15:23.957 --> 15:26.291
but you guys are
really fucking hot.

15:26.293 --> 15:28.259
Like snap your fingers hot.

15:28.261 --> 15:31.362
- And you're like the
2nd fattest in the group.

15:31.364 --> 15:33.097
Are we good now, bro?

15:33.099 --> 15:34.299
- I guess.

15:34.301 --> 15:36.134
- What's range 15?

15:36.136 --> 15:38.336
- That's where that fucking
soldier told us to go.

15:38.338 --> 15:40.004
- It's a fallback
point for an ele.

15:40.006 --> 15:42.206
- Wait, are you
guys military too?

15:42.208 --> 15:43.141
- Yeah.

15:43.143 --> 15:45.510
I'm ex idf and she's my cousin.

15:45.512 --> 15:47.145
- Wait, your Israeli?

15:47.147 --> 15:50.281
- Yeah, I was like screaming
in yiddish the entire time.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.650
- No offense but that happens
a lot more than you think.

15:52.652 --> 15:54.018
- A lot more.

15:55.387 --> 15:56.654
- What's an ele?

15:56.656 --> 15:59.958
- Extinction level event, Jack.

15:59.960 --> 16:01.426
- Hey man, I'm really impressed.

16:01.428 --> 16:02.994
- It says it on the map.

16:02.996 --> 16:04.162
- God damn it.

16:04.164 --> 16:05.663
- Well, range 15, that's
where we need to go.

16:05.665 --> 16:09.300
- Oh hey, brilliant fucking
idea, tactical Tesla.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.569
Here's another one, we
need to get weapons,

16:11.571 --> 16:13.404
supplies and we need
to check in at the base

16:13.406 --> 16:15.139
to see if it's still intact.

16:15.141 --> 16:16.140
- Thanks, dad.

16:16.142 --> 16:17.408
Prom ended at 11.

16:17.410 --> 16:19.410
- You guys gonna come with us?

16:19.412 --> 16:21.212
- No, we're all set.

16:22.247 --> 16:23.681
We're just gonna
ride this out until...

16:23.683 --> 16:25.416
- we save the world?

16:25.418 --> 16:27.051
- You guys?

16:27.053 --> 16:28.086
Yeah right.

16:29.088 --> 16:31.155
- Listen here, oven mitts,

16:31.157 --> 16:32.423
there's thousands
of them out there

16:32.425 --> 16:34.225
and as bad ass as
you think you are,

16:34.227 --> 16:37.328
you won't be able to
hold them off forever.

16:37.330 --> 16:38.463
Boop.

16:38.465 --> 16:39.697
- Jesus could.

16:39.699 --> 16:41.332
- Who is this fucking guy?

16:41.334 --> 16:42.300
- Jesus?

16:42.302 --> 16:43.568
He's our lord and savoir.

16:43.570 --> 16:44.435
He died for our sins.

16:44.437 --> 16:46.037
- Don't mind him.

16:46.039 --> 16:48.106
He was Billy Bob's
stand-in in sling blade

16:48.108 --> 16:50.241
but that's completely
irrelevant right now.

16:50.243 --> 16:51.776
I'll protect you.

16:51.778 --> 16:54.312
- And I will never fuck you.

17:00.085 --> 17:02.186
We'll go but if shit goes down

17:02.188 --> 17:04.355
we're hiding behind
the crimson chin here.

17:04.357 --> 17:05.790
- Hey, what's with
all the chintrest?

17:05.791 --> 17:08.026
- That goddamn thing is huge.

17:08.028 --> 17:10.627
It's like do you have to
drink with a bendy straw or...

17:10.630 --> 17:12.363
- can we stop playing
fuck, fuck, goose,

17:12.365 --> 17:14.232
and just gear up?

17:14.233 --> 17:15.599
- You know what guys?

17:15.602 --> 17:18.636
For once in nicks life,
he's actually fucking right.

17:18.637 --> 17:22.205
So wants a sweet
fucking gear up montage?

17:25.676 --> 17:27.744
This is really
convenient for us.

19:34.677 --> 19:37.376
- I feel like I just
blacked out on freedom.

19:37.377 --> 19:41.546
- I feel like I got butt
fucked by Francis Scott key.

19:41.548 --> 19:43.814
- Is there any dialogue
between you two

19:43.816 --> 19:46.317
that doesn't involve
homo sexual undertones?

19:46.319 --> 19:48.653
- Not one single time.

19:48.655 --> 19:51.222
- Just keep your
body away from me.

19:57.829 --> 19:58.729
- Holy shit!

19:58.731 --> 20:00.531
Zombies one o'clock.

21:06.365 --> 21:10.568
("What a wonderful world"

21:29.655 --> 21:31.756
- Jack killed everything.

21:31.758 --> 21:32.723
- Jesus.

21:32.725 --> 21:33.658
- Let's go, let's go.

21:33.660 --> 21:35.760
- Let's go, let's go.

21:38.597 --> 21:40.331
- We should all take camaros.

21:40.333 --> 21:41.766
- Bro, this isn't swingers.

21:41.768 --> 21:43.768
We're not taking 30 cars.

21:43.770 --> 21:45.369
- What do you suggest?

21:45.371 --> 21:46.570
- We can take the whisky
truck that they confiscated

21:46.572 --> 21:47.772
the night I got arrested.

21:47.774 --> 21:49.407
- I'll drive.

21:49.409 --> 21:50.908
- You sure you don't want to
put your dick in it first?

21:50.910 --> 21:52.443
- If he did, I bet
he'd fill it up with...

21:52.445 --> 21:53.744
- premium?

21:53.746 --> 21:56.380
- It's like you're
living inside of me!

21:57.550 --> 21:59.383
- Bro, she's never
gonna fuck you, alright?

21:59.385 --> 22:00.985
Evan, what the
fuck are you doing?

22:00.987 --> 22:01.987
- Taking a piss.

22:06.793 --> 22:08.326
- What happened?

22:08.328 --> 22:09.328
- Fuck!

22:09.929 --> 22:11.896
Fucking ripped my dick off!

22:14.667 --> 22:16.567
- Hey, on scale
from shaft to tip,

22:16.569 --> 22:17.968
how much did that fucker get?

22:17.970 --> 22:19.103
- Shut up!

22:19.105 --> 22:20.504
Get over here and help me!

22:20.506 --> 22:23.741
- Come Evan, quit
dicking around.

22:24.711 --> 22:25.810
- Fuck you.

22:25.812 --> 22:27.712
- Hey bro, you
really got the shaft.

22:28.648 --> 22:29.848
- This is worse than syphilis.

22:30.650 --> 22:31.716
Fuck you!

22:31.718 --> 22:32.917
Just fucking kill me.

22:32.919 --> 22:34.518
- No bro, we're
gonna let you turn

22:34.520 --> 22:36.387
and then feed you your own dick,

22:36.389 --> 22:37.621
you cock sucker.

22:37.623 --> 22:38.923
- Fuck you man!

22:46.866 --> 22:48.566
- Hey Evan, there you go

22:48.568 --> 22:49.800
- just fucking kill me.

22:49.802 --> 22:50.668
- Hey no bro, I'm just kidding.

22:50.670 --> 22:51.670
I'll kill you.

22:53.873 --> 22:56.140
- Just like all the others.

22:57.442 --> 22:58.142
- You guys ready?

22:58.144 --> 22:59.477
Let's go.

22:59.479 --> 23:01.145
To the whiskey truck.

23:26.705 --> 23:28.439
- Fuck bro, I need some food.

23:28.441 --> 23:30.408
Killing zombies really
works up an appetite.

23:30.410 --> 23:31.575
- Hey man, be careful in there.

23:31.577 --> 23:34.178
Do me a favor, grab your rifle.

23:34.180 --> 23:35.713
- Do you see you where we are?

23:35.715 --> 23:36.814
Pretty sure it's abandoned.

23:36.816 --> 23:37.982
Anyone else?

23:37.984 --> 23:39.264
- Anything that
rhymes with beer.

23:40.119 --> 23:41.719
- It's great to see that the
zombie fucking apocalypse

23:41.721 --> 23:43.020
hasn't changed you.

23:43.022 --> 23:43.888
Grab me some kill cliff.

23:43.890 --> 23:44.855
- Got it.

23:44.857 --> 23:46.157
- I'll take some goldfish.

23:46.159 --> 23:49.126
- That's a children's
snack, you fat fuck.

23:49.128 --> 23:51.796
- I do have a
boyish quality about me.

23:51.798 --> 23:53.864
- And it shines through
like heavens light on

23:53.866 --> 23:54.999
to all of us.

23:56.468 --> 23:57.701
- Anyone else?

23:57.703 --> 23:59.470
- Seriously man, stay
away from the glass.

23:59.472 --> 24:00.638
I don't want you
getting yanked through.

24:00.640 --> 24:02.473
- Bro, do you see
how fucking big I am?

24:02.475 --> 24:04.008
You know how big a
mother fucker would have

24:04.010 --> 24:05.209
to be to fucking pull
me through a window?

24:05.211 --> 24:07.812
- Surprisingly, I'm
with Nick on this one

24:07.814 --> 24:10.214
because if this
was a zombie movie,

24:10.216 --> 24:11.782
you'd be getting ripped
through that glass

24:11.784 --> 24:12.983
right about now.

24:12.985 --> 24:14.618
- Mat, this isn't
a zombie movie.

24:16.956 --> 24:18.756
- Mother fucker, let's
go, let's go, let's go.

24:19.192 --> 24:20.157
- Shit, did you see the size

24:20.159 --> 24:22.726
of that mother fucking zombie?

24:23.795 --> 24:24.995
- Fucking men.

24:29.001 --> 24:30.534
- Are you infected?

24:30.536 --> 24:31.536
Answer me.

24:32.170 --> 24:33.771
- You tell me dude.

24:33.773 --> 24:36.173
Whoa, you gonna shoot
me for stealing?

24:36.175 --> 24:37.675
- What?

24:37.677 --> 24:38.509
- That's right, I'm
slurpees for free and shit.

24:38.511 --> 24:39.710
What up?

24:39.712 --> 24:41.712
Lights were out, so i
came in to get mine.

24:41.714 --> 24:43.147
Know what I'm saying?

24:43.149 --> 24:45.049
- Hey fuck stick, it's the
zombie fucking apocalypse.

24:45.051 --> 24:47.785
You can literally take
anything in here if you wanted.

24:47.787 --> 24:49.587
- Oh shit, for real?

24:51.656 --> 24:53.524
God it's hot in here.

24:53.526 --> 24:55.125
That's why I stripped down.

24:55.127 --> 24:57.528
Skins a natural
coolant, my uncle says.

24:57.530 --> 24:59.864
Level with me bro, shits
for real free free?

24:59.866 --> 25:01.866
Cause I kinda feel like I'm
being mind tricked here.

25:01.868 --> 25:04.235
- Mother fucker,
get the fuck out!

25:04.237 --> 25:06.504
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, man.

25:07.272 --> 25:08.272
Hey, doll dick.

25:11.277 --> 25:15.212
You look like Randy quaid
with downs syndrome.

25:16.681 --> 25:19.683
- Randy quaid is
an American legend.

25:19.685 --> 25:22.219
I loved him in chaddyshack 2!

25:26.092 --> 25:28.626
Why'd you make me do this?

25:31.796 --> 25:33.097
- Hey Rocco, Rocco.

25:33.099 --> 25:35.065
- Shit, if he's a zombie,
i get to kill him.

25:35.067 --> 25:36.267
- He's my fucking friend.

25:36.269 --> 25:37.535
- It doesn't
matter, I called it.

25:37.537 --> 25:39.737
He's like a 12 point buck.

25:42.975 --> 25:44.775
- Oh my fucking god.

25:46.212 --> 25:50.781
- Jesus tap dancing
Christ, what the fuck?

25:50.783 --> 25:53.250
- You guys want to give
me a fucking minute?

25:53.252 --> 25:56.320
- For the first time in
my life, I have no words.

25:56.322 --> 25:58.188
- Is it weird that
I'm kinda in to it?

25:58.190 --> 26:00.624
- You have a doll glued
to your cock, Jack.

26:00.626 --> 26:01.992
So no, not really.

26:01.994 --> 26:03.160
- This is some barrack shit.

26:03.162 --> 26:04.862
I'm gonna get some
freedom fudge.

26:04.864 --> 26:08.265
- I'll get some with you
too, don't tell Heather.

26:08.267 --> 26:09.267
- Who's next?

26:13.072 --> 26:15.606
- Is there supposed
to be that much blood?

26:15.608 --> 26:16.941
- I hope so.

26:16.943 --> 26:18.709
- Oh shit yeah, fuck!

26:18.711 --> 26:19.843
- Okay, I'm good.

26:19.845 --> 26:21.245
Time to go, Jack.

26:23.014 --> 26:24.815
- I want one.

26:29.955 --> 26:31.088
- Yeah, yeah.

26:35.828 --> 26:37.161
- You ready, zombie fucker?

26:37.163 --> 26:38.329
- What, bro?

26:38.331 --> 26:39.797
That's some bucket
list type shit.

26:39.799 --> 26:41.131
- For who, a necrophiliac?

26:41.133 --> 26:43.067
- Oh come on, she
didn't look that dead.

26:43.069 --> 26:44.068
- Agreed.

26:44.070 --> 26:45.002
Kidding.

26:45.004 --> 26:47.304
I want you to know I'm
a perfect gentleman

26:47.306 --> 26:49.206
and I would never fuck a zombie.

26:49.208 --> 26:51.041
- So what if i
turned into a zombie?

26:51.043 --> 26:52.209
Would you fuck me?

26:52.211 --> 26:54.178
- Why, do you want
to turn into a zombie

26:54.180 --> 26:55.346
and have sex with me?

26:55.348 --> 26:56.947
- See.

26:56.949 --> 26:59.316
- What I was answering a
question with a question.

27:03.655 --> 27:05.389
- This bitch got enough gas
to get us to base, you think?

27:05.391 --> 27:05.389
- I hope so man.

27:05.391 --> 27:09.193
I don't think I can
handle seeing another
zombie get fucked.

27:09.195 --> 27:10.728
- I've seen worse bro,
you'll be alright.

27:10.730 --> 27:11.730
Thailand.

27:48.066 --> 27:50.701
- You know, I can't believe
you just fucking did that.

27:52.138 --> 27:54.304
- I'm telling you, I found
love in a hopeless place.

27:54.306 --> 27:56.774
- Did you seriously just
quote a rhianna song

27:56.776 --> 27:58.709
to describe sex with a zombie?

27:58.711 --> 28:00.978
- I feel like I'm her
Chris brown, you know?

28:00.980 --> 28:02.046
- You didn't beat her as much.

28:02.048 --> 28:03.447
Terrible euphemism.

28:03.449 --> 28:04.915
- Seriously.

28:04.917 --> 28:06.116
- You know, I'm not ashamed.

28:06.118 --> 28:07.918
The heart wants what
the heart wants.

28:22.834 --> 28:23.834
- No, don't drink it!

28:23.836 --> 28:25.002
- What the fuck, bro.

28:25.004 --> 28:26.170
- It's a bad batch.

28:26.172 --> 28:27.738
- He put viper semen in it.

28:27.740 --> 28:29.106
- Well, a scientist did.

28:29.108 --> 28:31.809
- Since is when a scientist
part of a distillery?

28:31.811 --> 28:33.310
- You see, my dad's
old army buddy

28:33.312 --> 28:34.945
is an amateur scientist,

28:34.947 --> 28:36.413
he's the only one we knew
how could distill whiskey.

28:36.415 --> 28:37.748
This was our first batch.

28:37.750 --> 28:39.283
- An amateur scientist?

28:39.285 --> 28:41.452
That would be like using
an amateur bomb tech.

28:41.454 --> 28:44.788
That just shouldn't be a thing.

28:44.790 --> 28:46.423
Is that toxic shit
even drinkable?

28:46.425 --> 28:49.359
- I'm gonna go
with a soft, maybe.

28:50.995 --> 28:52.429
Fuck.

28:52.431 --> 28:54.031
We got trouble up ahead.

28:55.401 --> 28:57.234
- I don't we can get
around this shit, man.

28:57.236 --> 28:58.736
- You glorious fucks cover me,

28:58.738 --> 29:00.137
I'll move the Humvee.

29:15.787 --> 29:17.321
- Out of ammo,
going to the truck.

29:17.323 --> 29:19.123
- Grab me some mags!

29:29.068 --> 29:30.901
- Who's the punk bitch now?

29:30.903 --> 29:33.270
Where the fuck are the keys?

29:33.272 --> 29:36.273
Fucking humvees
shouldn't have keys.

30:08.039 --> 30:09.039
- Oh shit.

30:10.509 --> 30:11.542
- Guys, hold you fire.

30:11.544 --> 30:13.076
- Holy shit.

30:13.078 --> 30:15.112
- Viper semen forever.

30:15.114 --> 30:16.046
- What happened?

30:16.048 --> 30:17.347
- Amateur scientist for the win.

30:17.349 --> 30:20.050
I think we just found
ourselves a cure.

30:20.052 --> 30:22.085
- You've got to be shitting me.

30:23.155 --> 30:24.254
- Nope.

30:24.256 --> 30:25.222
- Well, if the
colonels still alive,

30:25.224 --> 30:26.590
we gotta get to him asap.

30:26.592 --> 30:28.525
- I can not wait to see
the look on his face

30:28.527 --> 30:31.528
when he finds out the cure
for the zombie apocalypse

30:31.530 --> 30:32.996
came from you.

30:32.998 --> 30:36.033
- Shit is gonna be
good, my friend.

30:36.035 --> 30:38.936
Let's go butt fuck some zombies.

30:49.914 --> 30:51.248
- Get back in your vehicle.

30:51.250 --> 30:53.283
This is a secure
government installation

30:53.285 --> 30:55.485
and you cannot walk around
here without a pt belt.

30:55.487 --> 30:57.287
- Easy there, high speed.

30:57.289 --> 30:58.488
This is my safety.

30:58.490 --> 31:00.390
- No pt belt, no access buddy.

31:00.392 --> 31:01.558
- Whoa, whoa whoa.

31:01.560 --> 31:03.360
I was just testing you

31:03.362 --> 31:05.095
and you passed.

31:05.097 --> 31:07.030
Now, I don't have any pt belts

31:07.032 --> 31:10.400
but what I do have is
some challenge coins.

31:10.402 --> 31:11.402
Huh, huh?

31:12.437 --> 31:13.303
- Is that real?

31:13.305 --> 31:14.238
- Are those real?

31:14.240 --> 31:15.339
- Oh, they're real my friend.

31:15.341 --> 31:17.274
- The fuck outta here.

31:17.276 --> 31:18.141
- There we go.

31:18.143 --> 31:19.143
- Oh man!

31:20.411 --> 31:21.511
- Now, is the colonel here

31:21.513 --> 31:23.347
and more importantly
is he alive?

31:23.349 --> 31:24.214
- Yeah he's alive.

31:24.216 --> 31:25.582
He's at the jock.

31:25.584 --> 31:26.650
Can we keep these?

31:26.652 --> 31:27.584
- All yours.

31:27.586 --> 31:29.353
Let's open that gate then, yeah?

31:29.355 --> 31:30.220
- Okay, yeah.

31:30.222 --> 31:31.889
- Oh.

31:31.891 --> 31:32.891
Alright.

31:34.993 --> 31:36.126
- Just kinda.

31:37.328 --> 31:38.328
Kinda put your back into it.

31:38.330 --> 31:39.329
- Does it go that way?

31:39.331 --> 31:40.664
It's a new gate.

31:41.666 --> 31:43.400
I got it, I got it.

31:44.569 --> 31:45.535
I got it.

31:45.537 --> 31:47.104
- What the fuck just happened?

31:47.106 --> 31:49.239
- The army's real
weird about pt belts.

31:50.676 --> 31:52.342
- So to keep you safe, they
we're going to shoot you?

31:52.344 --> 31:53.577
- Yeah.

31:53.579 --> 31:55.178
- And they didn't
because of coins?

31:55.180 --> 31:56.413
- You've got to understand.

31:56.415 --> 31:58.315
Challenge coins are
like po kryptonite.

31:58.317 --> 32:00.317
They're defenseless
to their power.

32:06.391 --> 32:07.691
- You tell that shit for brains

32:07.693 --> 32:08.959
I want no more excuses.

32:08.961 --> 32:10.160
I want to hit them.

32:10.162 --> 32:11.194
I want to know how
many are out there.

32:11.196 --> 32:12.496
I want to know who's on...

32:12.498 --> 32:13.498
What?

32:14.532 --> 32:16.967
What the fuck do we have here?

32:19.638 --> 32:21.305
Mat fucking best.

32:21.307 --> 32:22.506
- Colonel.

32:22.508 --> 32:24.007
- Is that a blow up
doll you got glued

32:24.009 --> 32:25.009
to your cock there, son?

32:25.544 --> 32:26.944
- Sort of.

32:26.946 --> 32:27.611
You see, I fell down
with my pants unzipped

32:27.613 --> 32:28.478
and I just kinda...

32:28.480 --> 32:29.546
- oh shut the fuck up!

32:29.548 --> 32:30.514
- Alright.

32:30.516 --> 32:32.015
- Now, gentlemen, stand down.

32:32.017 --> 32:34.985
Let me have a moment
with this guy alone.

32:34.987 --> 32:35.953
Alright.

32:35.955 --> 32:37.054
- Colonel, it's been a minute.

32:37.056 --> 32:38.655
How you been?

32:38.657 --> 32:40.657
- I'm surprised that you two
ass hats are still alive.

32:40.659 --> 32:42.592
- And we found a cure.

32:45.264 --> 32:46.430
- Are you serious?

32:46.432 --> 32:49.232
- Serious as a heart
attack, my friend.

32:49.234 --> 32:50.667
- In my office now, Mr. best.

32:50.669 --> 32:52.102
- Got it.

32:53.004 --> 32:55.405
- You stay here, gomer pyle.

33:07.118 --> 33:09.419
- Love what you've done
with the place, colonel.

33:09.421 --> 33:12.089
It's very, restoration
hardware meets mash.

33:12.091 --> 33:13.690
- Oh, zip your dick!

33:14.993 --> 33:16.760
Now, we found the cure,
is about the only words

33:16.762 --> 33:19.629
you could of used to prevent
me from putting my foot

33:19.631 --> 33:21.031
in your ass.

33:21.033 --> 33:23.033
- What's with the
hostility, sir?

33:23.035 --> 33:24.234
- Really?

33:24.236 --> 33:25.676
You didn't fuck my
arm less daughter?

33:27.706 --> 33:29.506
- This is way better
than a hand job!

33:33.679 --> 33:34.544
- Daddy?

33:34.546 --> 33:35.679
- What the fuck?

33:35.681 --> 33:36.546
What the fuck?

33:36.548 --> 33:37.548
- Shit!

33:39.150 --> 33:43.120
I am pretty sure I would
of remembered that.

33:43.122 --> 33:44.654
- Hey, daddy, do you
have the barracks keys?

33:44.656 --> 33:46.189
- Coming in hot.

33:47.593 --> 33:49.659
- What the stump fuck?

33:49.661 --> 33:52.796
- Look at my daughter,
sergeant best.

33:54.699 --> 33:56.733
Doesn't ring a bell, still?

33:56.735 --> 34:00.203
- It's nice to see
you from the front.

34:00.205 --> 34:01.605
- What is it, Mary?

34:01.607 --> 34:03.673
- That special ops guy is
in the mess hall for you.

34:03.675 --> 34:05.075
- Well tell him i
still need a minute.

34:05.077 --> 34:06.276
- Okay.

34:06.278 --> 34:09.212
- So, tell me about this cure.

34:09.214 --> 34:11.815
- Why don't you tell
me how it happened.

34:11.817 --> 34:14.251
- This isn't fucking clue!

34:14.253 --> 34:17.621
Take shit seriously for
once in your life, mat.

34:17.623 --> 34:20.424
A plane crashed coming
in from overseas.

34:20.426 --> 34:22.426
We don't know if
it was on purpose

34:22.428 --> 34:26.063
or if a passenger unknowingly
had the virus and spread it.

34:26.065 --> 34:28.831
The disease spread like herpes
in a fort bragg barracks.

34:28.833 --> 34:32.168
Right now, all we need
to do is contain it.

34:32.170 --> 34:34.170
Candlestick, library, go.

34:34.172 --> 34:35.472
- Well as crazy as it sounds.

34:35.474 --> 34:37.741
The guys and I have
been distilling whiskey

34:37.743 --> 34:41.545
and let's just say
we had a bad crate.

34:41.547 --> 34:42.846
- Bad crate of
distilled whiskey?

34:42.848 --> 34:43.780
I'm not following.

34:43.782 --> 34:46.583
- It was mixed with viper semen.

34:47.652 --> 34:49.786
- That sounds like a
shitty Internet video

34:49.788 --> 34:51.188
or the plot of a bad movie.

34:53.759 --> 34:56.693
- As as ridiculous as it
sounds, it's the truth.

34:56.695 --> 34:58.361
One of my guys
smashed a zombies head

34:58.363 --> 35:00.697
in with the whiskey bottle
and they changed back.

35:00.699 --> 35:02.132
- Where's this whiskey now?

35:02.134 --> 35:03.567
- It's safe in the mess hall.

35:03.569 --> 35:05.502
- With the guy from of mice
and men and the chubby one?

35:05.504 --> 35:09.506
- I like to consider it the
ranger up and article 15.

35:09.508 --> 35:10.841
- I'll have one
of my guys grab it

35:10.843 --> 35:13.143
and take it over to range 15.

35:13.145 --> 35:14.344
- Why don't you
just test it here

35:14.346 --> 35:15.879
and distribute it
amongst the people?

35:15.881 --> 35:17.781
- Our building was compromised
and most of the scientists

35:17.783 --> 35:17.781
were killed.

35:17.783 --> 35:21.151
The remaining ones, we
sent over to ranger 15.

35:21.153 --> 35:22.686
- Well then, we'll just take
it over to range 15 ourselves.

35:22.688 --> 35:23.687
- Oh, shit.

35:23.689 --> 35:25.622
I'm not gonna leave
the fate of the world

35:25.624 --> 35:26.823
to you fuck offs.

35:26.825 --> 35:28.658
- No offense colonel
but I trust us

35:28.660 --> 35:30.193
more than I trust your guy.

35:30.195 --> 35:31.561
Our guys are fearless.

35:31.563 --> 35:33.797
- I bet I can fit 14
hot dogs in my mouth.

35:33.799 --> 35:34.898
- I bet I can do 30.

35:34.900 --> 35:37.134
- Why would you want to do that?

35:37.136 --> 35:39.236
- Because we're fearless!

35:45.843 --> 35:47.644
- I prefer my guy.

35:47.646 --> 35:50.313
- And who the fuck is your guy?

35:50.315 --> 35:52.749
- Sergeant major gene vandenham.

35:52.751 --> 35:54.284
Have you heard of him?

35:54.286 --> 35:55.452
- Yeah, I've fucking
heard of him.

35:55.454 --> 35:56.853
Fuck gene.

35:56.855 --> 35:58.188
You know all that mother
fucker is is the little...

35:58.190 --> 35:59.190
- hero?

36:17.275 --> 36:20.277
Sergeant major gene
vandenham is America.

36:20.279 --> 36:22.279
I fucking love that guy.

36:22.281 --> 36:22.279
Everybody loves that guy.

36:22.281 --> 36:25.749
Now, that's the kind man i
want to see my daughter with.

36:25.751 --> 36:27.317
Hell, that's the kind
of guy everybody wants

36:27.319 --> 36:28.485
to see their daughter with.

36:28.487 --> 36:30.587
You know, i'ma be
honest with you.

36:30.589 --> 36:32.689
I've been married
for over 38 years now

36:32.691 --> 36:34.558
and if gene vandenham asked me

36:34.560 --> 36:36.660
to take him in my mouth,

36:36.662 --> 36:38.528
I'd honestly consider it.

36:38.530 --> 36:39.930
- God man.

36:39.932 --> 36:43.233
- You and your boys can
follow on a convoy behind.

36:43.235 --> 36:45.635
That will be all, sergeant.

36:45.637 --> 36:46.637
- Thanks.

36:47.638 --> 36:49.839
- And keep your
dick in your pants.

36:49.841 --> 36:51.508
- I nub you.

36:51.510 --> 36:53.310
- Asshole.

36:57.582 --> 36:59.249
- So what happened?

36:59.251 --> 37:00.917
- He said their
scientists are at range 15

37:00.919 --> 37:02.852
and they want fucking
gene vandenham

37:02.854 --> 37:04.487
to take the whiskey there

37:04.489 --> 37:07.724
and we get to follow along
in a sweet fuck train.

37:07.726 --> 37:08.758
- Fucking bullshit!

37:08.760 --> 37:09.693
That's our whiskey.

37:09.695 --> 37:11.828
- And our viper semen!

37:11.830 --> 37:15.265
- Look Matt, sometimes
things can look pretty bleak

37:15.267 --> 37:16.533
but when life gets hard...

37:16.535 --> 37:18.535
- Nick, you promised.

37:18.537 --> 37:19.736
- No officer shit, bro.

37:19.738 --> 37:21.271
- Alright, alright.

37:21.273 --> 37:22.706
Seriously, though.

37:22.708 --> 37:24.941
If gene takes the whiskey,
we've got a much better chance

37:24.943 --> 37:26.543
of success.

37:26.545 --> 37:27.877
- And a much better chance
that none of us get killed.

37:27.879 --> 37:29.546
- I'm cool with that.

37:29.548 --> 37:31.014
- I would of protected you.

37:31.016 --> 37:32.415
- Oh yeah?

37:32.417 --> 37:34.918
Let's see, go with the
world renowned hero

37:34.920 --> 37:37.821
or a guy who shoved 14
hot dogs in his mouth.

37:37.823 --> 37:39.589
- Dude, you dogged 14?

37:39.591 --> 37:40.991
Champion!

37:40.993 --> 37:43.460
- No, that's not a
high five moment.

37:43.462 --> 37:44.928
- Every moments a
high five moment.

37:46.365 --> 37:47.365
- Oh god.

38:58.035 --> 39:00.637
- You boys have the whiskey?

39:00.639 --> 39:02.005
- Oh yeah.

39:02.007 --> 39:03.807
- Hand it over, son.

39:06.252 --> 39:07.511
- I'm sorry, I just...

39:07.512 --> 39:11.781
- you, you, you, just
got lost in my eyes?

39:11.783 --> 39:14.484
Relax, it doesn't make you gay.

39:14.486 --> 39:16.019
It makes you compassionate.

39:16.021 --> 39:17.687
- Oh, you're so right, gene.

39:17.689 --> 39:18.922
- I know.

39:18.924 --> 39:19.924
Release.

39:22.693 --> 39:25.362
There's my fat bottomed girl.

39:25.364 --> 39:27.497
Thanks, guardians of the galaxy,

39:27.499 --> 39:29.766
I'll keep an eye on
you in my rear view.

39:29.768 --> 39:30.900
Stay close.

39:30.902 --> 39:32.068
You too, second.

39:32.070 --> 39:33.002
- Fuck did you just call me?

39:33.004 --> 39:34.004
- Seconds.

39:35.039 --> 39:36.840
That's your middle
name, isn't it?

39:38.110 --> 39:40.643
- Mat second best.

39:40.645 --> 39:42.412
This is like slam poetry.

39:42.414 --> 39:43.146
Genius

39:43.148 --> 39:45.882
- catch ya on the
dark side of the moon,

39:45.884 --> 39:45.882
cheese squeeze.

39:45.884 --> 39:50.620
Keep your ears buttered up
while I set fire to the rain.

39:50.622 --> 39:52.922
- What the fuck
does that even mean?

39:52.924 --> 39:54.791
- You know what it means?

39:54.793 --> 39:56.559
You don't know where I've been.

39:56.561 --> 39:59.896
Rodney king riots, 1984, I'm
driving through the streets

39:59.898 --> 40:03.566
of and the
city they call long beach.

40:03.568 --> 40:06.636
When a young African
American says to me,

40:06.638 --> 40:09.539
"hey man, you some
kind of gi Joe?

40:10.841 --> 40:11.975
Mr. jarhead."

40:13.411 --> 40:15.545
I says so what if I am?

40:15.547 --> 40:19.983
And he says, "well why
don't you suck on my dick

40:19.985 --> 40:22.419
and then lick on my balls."

40:27.858 --> 40:29.092
And before he can
get that s out,

40:29.094 --> 40:31.928
I squeeze the trig and
blew his brains outs.

40:31.930 --> 40:34.497
The next day, the
riots were over.

40:34.499 --> 40:36.466
The moral of the story is this,

40:36.468 --> 40:39.002
why don't you walk
168 miles in my shoes

40:39.004 --> 40:41.571
with 16 dead soldiers
over your shoulder

40:41.573 --> 40:43.940
before you ask me what
the fuck that means.

40:43.942 --> 40:45.809
Good day, fuck faces.

40:47.077 --> 40:50.146
By the way, wear a condom
on that dick of yours

40:50.148 --> 40:52.882
if you're eye fuck me on
the way out like that.

40:52.884 --> 40:55.518
This is gene's world.

41:00.591 --> 41:03.693
- That guy is such a
fucking celebrity cameo.

41:03.695 --> 41:05.895
- Hey man, I don't want
to fucking be here.

41:05.897 --> 41:06.897
- Oh.

41:07.632 --> 41:08.765
Hey, Ron Jeremy.

41:08.767 --> 41:10.533
- Your indiegogo
campaign went so well

41:10.535 --> 41:12.602
you can actually buy people.

41:12.604 --> 41:14.637
- You're right, you
can go dude, thanks.

41:14.639 --> 41:15.972
- Great.

41:15.974 --> 41:18.208
- Gene's kinda legit.

41:18.210 --> 41:20.176
- Gene is a douche bag

41:20.178 --> 41:21.644
and he's treating all of us

41:21.646 --> 41:23.880
like the fucking b team.

41:23.882 --> 41:25.782
I'm gonna go outside
and get some fresh air.

41:25.784 --> 41:27.484
Let my suck dangle.

41:28.953 --> 41:30.186
- Grab a pic.

41:30.188 --> 41:32.489
I knew before it even
came out of my mouth.

41:32.491 --> 41:34.057
- Mat, can I come with you?

41:34.059 --> 41:36.493
I haven't said
anything in a while.

41:36.495 --> 41:37.727
- Sure, eunice.

41:40.931 --> 41:43.500
- Happy birthday, Matt James.

41:46.103 --> 41:47.904
- Mat, are you okay?

41:48.906 --> 41:50.540
- I'm fine, Eleanor.

41:50.542 --> 41:51.674
- Eliza.

41:51.676 --> 41:52.909
- Whatever.

41:52.911 --> 41:54.110
I just hate that
gene vadendouche.

41:54.112 --> 41:55.211
Everything get's
handed over to him

41:55.213 --> 41:57.547
like I'm some
incompetent clown dick.

41:57.549 --> 41:59.782
- I don't think your an
incompetent clown dick.

41:59.784 --> 42:00.817
I think you're a...

42:00.819 --> 42:02.819
- intense, strong, intelligent,

42:02.821 --> 42:05.588
ripped like a pair
of def leppard jeans?

42:05.590 --> 42:07.023
Hear it all the time,

42:07.025 --> 42:09.559
but gene's always
stealing the spotlight.

42:09.561 --> 42:12.595
- Well you can
have the spotlight.

42:12.597 --> 42:14.030
You can have two.

42:16.634 --> 42:20.036
- Emily, we shouldn't
but we're probably going

42:20.038 --> 42:21.237
to anyways so.

42:22.072 --> 42:22.071
- Oh, can you do it in my butt?

42:22.073 --> 42:25.875
I don't want to get pregnant
during the zombie apocalypse.

42:25.877 --> 42:26.877
- Kind of hot actually.

42:29.781 --> 42:30.747
Did you eat popcorn?

42:30.749 --> 42:31.714
- Yeah, is it sharp?

42:31.716 --> 42:32.716
- Oh god.

42:34.318 --> 42:36.052
- It smells.

42:38.857 --> 42:40.123
- You got to be
fucking kidding me.

42:40.125 --> 42:41.858
- Oh shit.

42:53.637 --> 42:54.637
- We love you, gene.

42:58.610 --> 43:00.043
We love you man!

43:00.045 --> 43:01.077
You see his jawline?

43:01.079 --> 43:02.712
- It's like an angel.

43:02.714 --> 43:06.249
- I have energy, guy gives
me energy by his presence.

43:06.251 --> 43:07.283
- I want to drink his piss.

43:07.285 --> 43:08.151
- What?

43:08.153 --> 43:09.018
- Huh?

43:09.020 --> 43:10.253
- Come on, man.

43:11.755 --> 43:14.090
- That dude always wants
to be the tip of the spear

43:14.092 --> 43:16.359
but all I see is a
giant blue falcon.

43:16.361 --> 43:19.295
- Yeah maybe but he's
got an up-armour Humvee.

43:19.297 --> 43:20.663
Not to mention a 50 Cal.

43:20.665 --> 43:22.031
- And no one Manning it.

43:22.033 --> 43:23.766
Fuck that guy.

43:23.768 --> 43:26.336
Guys like that are
the reason I got out.

43:26.338 --> 43:30.740
- Shit man, guys like that
are the reason dudes enlist.

43:40.884 --> 43:44.354
- What the fuck is
this asshole doing now?

43:45.889 --> 43:47.323
- Zombie!

43:59.837 --> 44:01.037
You girls okay?

44:01.039 --> 44:02.271
- Definitely could
of killed that guy.

44:02.273 --> 44:04.207
- Sure you could of.

44:04.209 --> 44:07.410
Look here, chap stick, i
don't need my asshole waxed.

44:07.412 --> 44:10.813
A simple thank you, your
smajesty would suffice.

44:10.815 --> 44:12.081
- Not to happen, gene.

44:12.083 --> 44:14.083
- Smell this fire,
smokey the bear.

44:14.085 --> 44:15.885
The colonel just
phoned in by satellite.

44:15.887 --> 44:15.885
The zombies are gaining speed.

44:15.887 --> 44:19.822
They could overtake our
vehicles if we're not careful.

44:19.824 --> 44:23.926
According to his intel,
they're getting close.

44:23.928 --> 44:26.195
- Wait, you have a
sat phone in your car?

44:26.197 --> 44:29.198
- I got the 2018
lebronze in there.

44:30.267 --> 44:32.835
They give hand in
hand everything.

44:32.837 --> 44:33.970
- Fuck.

44:33.972 --> 44:35.371
- The colonel says
there's a helicopter pad

44:35.373 --> 44:37.106
about 26 miles from here
that he wants us to get to

44:37.108 --> 44:38.741
so we're not on the road.

44:38.743 --> 44:41.144
Change of plans,
change of pants.

44:41.146 --> 44:43.079
- Okay, so you want us
to follow behind you?

44:43.081 --> 44:45.214
- Yes, but I'll be on foot.

44:45.216 --> 44:47.083
Can you take the whiskey?

44:47.085 --> 44:48.251
- What the fuck?

44:48.253 --> 44:51.120
- I need you to take
the whiskey, dick

44:51.122 --> 44:53.890
and hold it with two hands.

44:53.892 --> 44:55.725
Can you handle that
soldier of fortune.

44:55.727 --> 44:56.727
- I've got the whiskey.

45:07.004 --> 45:08.971
- Someone has to protect us.

45:08.973 --> 45:10.306
There's god,

45:10.308 --> 45:12.241
then there's me.

45:12.243 --> 45:14.243
God must be busy.

45:14.245 --> 45:17.313
Lucky for, I don't
take Sundays off.

45:18.415 --> 45:20.917
- Bro, that's gonna
be my next tattoo.

45:20.919 --> 45:22.285
- I feel like I'm at the alter

45:22.287 --> 45:23.820
and Jesus is packing.

45:23.822 --> 45:25.788
- This is all so fucking stupid.

45:25.790 --> 45:28.157
Why doesn't one of
us man the 50 Cal

45:28.159 --> 45:30.093
while you drive?

45:30.095 --> 45:32.895
- For the same reason i
baptized myself as a baby.

45:32.897 --> 45:36.432
No one guards gene vandenham
but gene vandenham.

45:36.434 --> 45:37.934
Take the whiskey and be grateful

45:37.936 --> 45:39.368
I am who I am.

45:39.370 --> 45:41.971
- Bro, 26 miles is
an entire marathon.

45:41.973 --> 45:44.073
- I know, I ran Boston last year

45:44.075 --> 45:46.943
and won 46 full kits
setting a new world record.

45:46.945 --> 45:48.778
Try and keep up.

45:48.780 --> 45:50.046
- What the fuck ever, gene.

45:52.083 --> 45:54.217
- Fucking gene vandenham.

46:01.892 --> 46:03.893
- Fucking got it.

46:12.069 --> 46:14.203
- Fucking gene vandenham.

46:15.506 --> 46:17.907
- You all still realize how
ridiculously stupid this is?

46:17.909 --> 46:20.076
It has nothing to
do with necessity,

46:20.078 --> 46:22.445
just his own glory, right?

46:22.447 --> 46:23.312
- Sure man

46:23.314 --> 46:24.547
but look at that guy.

46:24.549 --> 46:26.382
He's a one man killing machine.

46:26.384 --> 46:28.451
I bet he even nukes those
two toddlers over there.

46:28.453 --> 46:30.887
- No gene, don't kill
the zombie toddlers!

46:32.090 --> 46:34.857
- Their mission
has been aborted!

46:35.926 --> 46:37.894
- Seriously hope he
steps on a land mine,

46:37.896 --> 46:39.395
like five of them.

46:53.143 --> 46:54.944
- Go, go, go!

46:56.814 --> 46:58.047
I'll cover you.

47:01.285 --> 47:03.152
- Gene, you're coming with us!

47:03.154 --> 47:04.954
- Negative, no room.

47:06.023 --> 47:08.991
Freedom is calling
and I have to answer.

47:08.993 --> 47:12.061
- There is literally an
empty seat designated

47:12.063 --> 47:13.596
for you, gene.

47:13.598 --> 47:15.264
- No offense, but
there's an empty seat

47:15.266 --> 47:17.533
in every single plane in
the United States designated

47:17.535 --> 47:18.968
for me.

47:18.970 --> 47:21.003
Just remember,
when you turn back

47:21.005 --> 47:23.606
and see only one set of
footprints in the sand.

47:23.608 --> 47:27.210
It was then, that I carried you.

47:27.212 --> 47:28.311
- Wheels up.

47:28.313 --> 47:29.378
Fuck that dude.

47:35.419 --> 47:36.919
Good luck getting out
of this one, gene,

47:36.921 --> 47:38.154
you cock tart!

47:38.156 --> 47:39.322
- I got it!

47:45.062 --> 47:47.263
- That is what gene
vandenham does.

47:47.265 --> 47:49.632
He is the only American hero.

47:50.868 --> 47:51.868
God damn!

47:58.175 --> 47:59.876
Why are we going to range 15?

47:59.878 --> 48:01.244
That place is probably
full of em by now.

48:01.246 --> 48:03.045
- Number one, that's
where the scientists are

48:03.047 --> 48:04.580
and we have the cure.

48:04.582 --> 48:06.048
- What's number two?

48:06.050 --> 48:08.317
- Pooping, pooping
is number two.

48:08.319 --> 48:10.920
- It's like every time
i try and like you,

48:10.922 --> 48:12.021
I just can't.

48:13.190 --> 48:14.624
- There is no
number two, grigsby.

48:14.626 --> 48:17.059
If we don't achieve
number one, we die.

48:17.061 --> 48:18.928
- Please refrain.

48:18.930 --> 48:20.563
- You know how hard that is?

48:20.565 --> 48:21.998
- Let him say it.

48:22.000 --> 48:23.366
- Come on, dude.

48:23.368 --> 48:25.101
- You're killing his spirit.

48:25.103 --> 48:27.136
- I'm gonna kill his
fucking microphone.

48:31.441 --> 48:32.541
- I can't believe it.

48:32.543 --> 48:34.310
We're actually gonna make it.

48:34.312 --> 48:37.013
- You fuck bag,
you just jinxed us.

48:37.015 --> 48:38.080
- What?

48:38.082 --> 48:38.948
No I didn't.

48:38.950 --> 48:40.182
- Yeah dude, you did.

48:40.184 --> 48:42.618
- That could give us
five seconds, rain man.

48:43.988 --> 48:45.621
- Hey you feeling
alright up there, man?

48:45.623 --> 48:47.456
You sure you didn't get bit?

48:47.458 --> 48:50.593
- Yeah I did, right
before you guys showed up.

48:50.595 --> 48:53.396
I can feel it
growing inside of me.

48:53.398 --> 48:55.631
This is my last mission.

48:55.633 --> 48:57.266
I just have one request,

48:57.268 --> 48:58.968
if any of you make it,

48:58.970 --> 49:01.537
go find my girlfriend,
she lives in El Paso.

49:01.539 --> 49:03.973
Tell her I love her.

49:03.975 --> 49:06.475
- Let's be realistic,
she's probably dead.

49:06.477 --> 49:07.977
- What?

49:07.979 --> 49:09.111
- I mean, come on,

49:09.113 --> 49:09.111
it's the end of the world

49:09.113 --> 49:12.448
with a bunch of bad
asses barely making it.

49:12.450 --> 49:14.150
A hot girl in El Paso?

49:14.152 --> 49:15.451
She's zombie shit by now.

49:15.453 --> 49:16.519
Wait, do zombies shit?

49:16.521 --> 49:17.987
- Rocco, shut the fuck up!

49:17.989 --> 49:20.256
- I'm just being honest.

49:20.258 --> 49:21.691
- He's right.

49:21.693 --> 49:23.693
She's dead and I'm bit.

49:25.662 --> 49:28.197
There's nothing to live for.

49:31.101 --> 49:33.035
Your names jt, right?

49:33.037 --> 49:33.703
Will you hold this?

49:33.705 --> 49:34.705
You're up.

49:44.014 --> 49:45.014
- We literally just told him

49:45.016 --> 49:47.149
we have the fucking cure.

49:52.123 --> 49:52.688
- We're gonna fucking die!

49:52.690 --> 49:53.689
- Fuck me.

49:53.691 --> 49:55.091
- I'll save us.

49:55.093 --> 49:56.492
- You're not gonna
save us, fat boy,

49:56.494 --> 49:58.294
you're probably gonna take
this whole plane down.

49:58.296 --> 50:01.297
- I'm learning to fly
but I ain't got wings.

50:01.299 --> 50:03.699
- We're all gonna die
because of your fat ass.

50:03.701 --> 50:05.534
You fat, fat, fatty fuck!

50:05.536 --> 50:09.372
I can't even fucking
believe how fat you are!

50:13.277 --> 50:15.344
- Hey, I saved us.

50:16.547 --> 50:17.747
- Fuck, fuck
the fucking whiskey.

50:17.749 --> 50:19.115
- How many are left?

50:19.117 --> 50:20.182
- Are you fucking kidding me?

50:20.184 --> 50:21.150
Two.

50:21.152 --> 50:22.685
- Two, two fucking bottles?

50:22.687 --> 50:23.687
God damn it!

50:25.188 --> 50:26.522
- Shut the fuck,
can we get the cure

50:26.524 --> 50:28.791
and keep fucking moving?

50:31.696 --> 50:34.196
I'd rather have us fucking
carry it, you know?

50:34.198 --> 50:36.465
- Bro, I got to take
a tactical shit dot come.

50:36.467 --> 50:38.434
- Shut the fuck up and let's go.

50:38.436 --> 50:40.316
- We got to get into
one of these neighborhoods.

50:41.506 --> 50:43.639
- I want my mommy.

50:58.423 --> 51:01.757
- Salutations, do
you guys like jazz?

51:01.759 --> 51:04.827
- You truly cannot
really enjoy it

51:04.829 --> 51:07.430
unless it's on vinyl.

51:07.432 --> 51:08.297
- That's right.

51:08.299 --> 51:09.165
- What the fuck?

51:09.167 --> 51:10.800
Fuck this, next house.

51:10.802 --> 51:11.667
- Fuck this.

51:11.669 --> 51:13.102
- Hey wait, wait.

51:13.104 --> 51:15.271
You guys got any
supplies we can have?

51:15.273 --> 51:16.772
- I got something that
will make your mustache

51:16.774 --> 51:17.774
stand up.

51:26.283 --> 51:27.817
Holy shit.

51:29.420 --> 51:31.787
An anti gun family that
decided to off themselves

51:31.789 --> 51:33.789
before they got infected.

51:33.791 --> 51:36.659
- How does that 2nd
amendment taste now?

51:36.661 --> 51:38.561
- Everybody hates
guns until you have

51:38.563 --> 51:41.630
to choke fuck yourself to
death with a hot curling iron.

51:41.632 --> 51:42.865
Touche.

51:46.270 --> 51:48.104
- Hey YouTube, this is
chazz and Parker again

51:48.106 --> 51:49.105
and on today's episode,

51:49.107 --> 51:50.272
we're just ticked.

51:50.274 --> 51:51.674
- Ticked, ticked.

51:51.676 --> 51:52.875
You tell em, chazz.

51:52.877 --> 51:54.543
- I'm just gonna
unzip my zip here,

51:54.545 --> 51:56.812
whip put my wee wee and
piss on these flags.

51:56.814 --> 52:00.282
- There's gonna be 14
stripes when we're done.

52:00.284 --> 52:01.617
- What the fuck is this?

52:01.619 --> 52:02.551
- Oh hell no.

52:02.553 --> 52:03.553
Back the fuck up.

52:06.756 --> 52:08.424
- Baby killers.

52:11.662 --> 52:13.429
- With great vengeance

52:13.431 --> 52:15.564
- and furious anger.

52:29.412 --> 52:31.247
- Hey, are you guys here
for the?

52:31.249 --> 52:34.850
- After, we're gonna have an
organic paleo kelp quiche.

52:34.852 --> 52:37.419
- No, no, we're good bro.

52:37.421 --> 52:39.555
- Okay, I'll eat all myself.

52:39.557 --> 52:40.656
- I'm gonna keep working out.

52:40.658 --> 52:41.857
- I'll never get fat.

52:51.201 --> 52:52.868
- Hey man, you doing alright?

52:58.341 --> 53:00.943
- Everyone's counting
on me for everything.

53:00.945 --> 53:02.611
I'm not their leader.

53:02.613 --> 53:04.747
I'm not a leader, I'm not

53:06.349 --> 53:09.185
and to be completely
honest with you dude,

53:09.187 --> 53:12.588
I don't think I can
do this shit anymore.

53:13.890 --> 53:15.724
- I know the weight of the
world is on your shoulders

53:15.726 --> 53:19.495
right now but it's
there for a reason.

53:19.497 --> 53:22.498
Most people quit the
second things get hard.

53:22.500 --> 53:23.933
You don't.

53:23.935 --> 53:26.202
The annals of history
are written on the backs

53:26.204 --> 53:27.536
of men like you.

53:27.538 --> 53:29.872
Men, who when faced
with overwhelming odds,

53:29.874 --> 53:31.640
when they reached
their breaking point,

53:31.642 --> 53:34.577
looked into the bowels
of hell and smiled.

53:34.579 --> 53:37.613
Men who answered the
bell for one more round.

53:37.615 --> 53:39.648
You're one of those men.

53:39.650 --> 53:41.584
We can do this, we
can rise up against

53:41.586 --> 53:44.253
the impossible and
we can save the world

53:44.255 --> 53:46.655
but we cannot do without you.

53:47.524 --> 53:49.391
We need mat best.

53:53.431 --> 53:54.431
Oh god damn it!

53:55.633 --> 53:56.999
- Got you mother fucker.

53:57.001 --> 53:58.634
- Fuck.

53:58.636 --> 53:59.876
- Great west point speech, bro.

54:00.738 --> 54:01.937
- Fuck off.

54:01.939 --> 54:02.771
- Did you just come
up with that shit

54:02.773 --> 54:04.240
on the spot or what?

54:04.242 --> 54:04.240
- It's what we do.

54:04.242 --> 54:07.376
- Alright, bring it
in, sister to sister,

54:07.378 --> 54:08.344
mother to daughter.

54:08.346 --> 54:09.346
- You son of...

54:15.318 --> 54:17.620
- You guys do some gay ass
shit for being in the military.

54:17.622 --> 54:19.755
- It's Thursday isn't it?

54:20.824 --> 54:22.358
- I fucking hate you.

54:22.360 --> 54:24.627
- It's a love
hate relationship, Nick.

54:24.629 --> 54:25.694
- It's a hate hate relationship.

54:25.696 --> 54:27.463
I fucking hate you.

55:04.768 --> 55:06.568
- There she is, boys.

55:06.570 --> 55:08.037
- That's range 15?

55:09.372 --> 55:10.539
- It looks like a power plant.

55:10.541 --> 55:11.541
- That's the point.

55:21.518 --> 55:22.618
- Oh, no, no, no.

55:22.620 --> 55:23.620
- Fuck!

55:26.356 --> 55:27.956
Fuck, it won't be long now.

55:27.958 --> 55:29.625
- Don't talk like that bro.

55:29.627 --> 55:30.893
- What the fuck do
you want me to say,

55:30.895 --> 55:32.061
that everything's
going to be okay?

55:32.063 --> 55:32.061
I'm gonna live
happily ever after

55:32.063 --> 55:36.498
and you'll come back and fuck
me in some convenience store?

55:36.500 --> 55:38.434
- Dude, she's different, bro.

55:38.436 --> 55:39.635
- You know what?

55:39.637 --> 55:40.637
So am I.

55:42.506 --> 55:44.473
- Come on bro,
just take the cure.

55:44.475 --> 55:45.908
- That only leave
us when one left.

55:45.910 --> 55:48.610
- So what, they're
scientists and shit.

55:48.612 --> 55:50.012
One is all they need.

55:50.014 --> 55:51.880
- Yeah man, you need to
take it before it spreads.

55:51.882 --> 55:53.015
- Are you sure?

55:53.017 --> 55:54.583
- Yeah brother,
you're changing fast.

55:54.585 --> 55:56.919
We have to administer
it, rectally.

55:56.921 --> 56:00.389
- Uh yeah, it's
crawling up your leg.

56:00.391 --> 56:00.389
Drinking it won't
be fast enough.

56:00.391 --> 56:04.693
- Fuck that, I know you mother
fuckers are fucking with me.

56:04.695 --> 56:06.528
- Baby, I don't want to
lose you, just take it.

56:06.530 --> 56:08.797
- Bro, I'm the medic
man, we got to do this.

56:08.799 --> 56:10.799
- Nick, is this legit?

56:10.801 --> 56:12.101
- I hate to say it
man but I don't think

56:12.103 --> 56:15.003
we have a choice right now.

56:15.005 --> 56:18.874
- You mother fuckers better
not be fucking with me!

56:18.876 --> 56:19.876
Rocco.

56:21.678 --> 56:25.414
- Brother, you're going to
feel a little bit of pressure.

57:00.183 --> 57:03.452
- Holy shit, holy shit,
it's fucking working.

57:03.454 --> 57:04.987
It's fucking working.

57:07.858 --> 57:09.725
Are you fucking kidding me?

57:09.727 --> 57:11.560
Are you fucking kidding me?

57:11.562 --> 57:14.096
- Why didn't you
just drink it, fag?

57:14.098 --> 57:15.431
- Gay!

57:15.433 --> 57:16.532
- Oh so gay, bro.

57:16.534 --> 57:17.699
- Get the fuck out...

57:17.701 --> 57:18.867
Are you fucking kidding.

57:18.869 --> 57:20.068
- You know i love you man.

57:20.070 --> 57:21.737
- Just get the fucking whiskey.

57:27.544 --> 57:29.478
Everyone spread out,
let's find a way in.

57:35.952 --> 57:37.953
Anybody got anything?

57:37.955 --> 57:39.087
- Nothing here, bro.

57:39.089 --> 57:40.456
- Nothing man.

57:40.458 --> 57:42.157
- I found something special.

57:42.159 --> 57:44.126
- No, he didn't.

57:44.128 --> 57:47.463
I found fat val kilmer though.

57:47.465 --> 57:50.098
- Jack, you got anything?

57:50.100 --> 57:51.500
- Nothing.

57:51.502 --> 57:53.068
- Sweet, the colonels
daughter was easier

57:53.070 --> 57:54.903
to enter than range 15.

57:54.905 --> 57:57.940
- To be fair bro,
she had no arms.

57:57.942 --> 57:59.302
- At least my zombie
girl had arms.

58:00.478 --> 58:02.110
- There's no way you're
comparing the two.

58:02.112 --> 58:04.246
- What are we gonna do
about getting in this silo?

58:04.248 --> 58:06.515
- I don't know but you better
hurry up real fucking fast.

58:06.517 --> 58:07.182
- Why, Elsie?

58:07.184 --> 58:09.184
- Eliza, they're coming.

58:10.855 --> 58:12.120
- Guys, we don't have
the ammo for this.

58:12.122 --> 58:13.922
- Bro, we ain't got
the time for this.

58:13.924 --> 58:15.123
- I'll get us the fucking time.

58:15.125 --> 58:16.058
- Hey man, I told you.

58:16.060 --> 58:17.025
There's no ammo in there.

58:17.027 --> 58:18.594
- I'm not looking for ammo.

58:18.596 --> 58:19.795
The most important thing
right is getting the whiskey

58:19.797 --> 58:20.929
into the silo.

58:20.931 --> 58:22.130
- Are you sure man?

58:22.132 --> 58:23.065
- The cure is more important

58:23.067 --> 58:25.501
than anyone of our lives, right?

58:30.540 --> 58:33.275
- Jack, you fucking stupid cunt.

58:33.277 --> 58:35.944
Guys found the entrance.

58:35.946 --> 58:38.013
Push the fucking button.

58:42.086 --> 58:45.821
- Everybody, lets
get inside, quick.

58:45.823 --> 58:47.055
Fucking idiot.

58:47.057 --> 58:48.057
- I'm sorry.

59:00.069 --> 59:01.537
- Most people don't get

59:01.539 --> 59:04.306
to decide how they go out.

59:04.308 --> 59:05.308
Today I do.

59:07.777 --> 59:10.112
There's a time to run

59:10.114 --> 59:11.847
and a time to fight

59:13.316 --> 59:15.584
and I ain't no bird dog.

59:28.798 --> 59:30.799
- You must be the brave soldiers

59:30.801 --> 59:33.268
that colonel holloway sent.

59:33.270 --> 59:34.670
This is the cure?

59:34.672 --> 59:36.004
- It sure is.

59:36.006 --> 59:37.673
- This is the cure?

59:37.675 --> 59:38.974
What is in this shit?

59:38.976 --> 59:42.177
- Whiskey mixed with
viper semen, sir.

59:42.179 --> 59:43.745
- Are you kidding me?

59:43.747 --> 59:45.113
- No, it's actually
a funny story.

59:45.115 --> 59:46.048
You see...

59:46.050 --> 59:47.249
- oh, I do love a funny story.

59:47.251 --> 59:50.218
I will try now, I will
see if you full of shit.

59:50.220 --> 59:52.287
Which I suspect you are.

59:56.926 --> 59:58.360
Oh you stupid pieces of shit.

59:58.362 --> 59:59.761
Get out!

59:59.763 --> 01:00:01.029
Don't let the door
hit you on the ass.

01:00:01.031 --> 01:00:02.230
- The fuck, bro?

01:00:02.232 --> 01:00:04.866
I've seen this shit
work twice already.

01:00:04.868 --> 01:00:06.668
- Would it just kill you
guys to pay attention

01:00:06.670 --> 01:00:07.670
just once?

01:00:14.677 --> 01:00:17.312
- Holy shit, what the
fuck just happened?

01:00:17.314 --> 01:00:19.047
- I just saved your life.

01:00:19.049 --> 01:00:21.783
You see the whiskey is
the primary element needed

01:00:21.785 --> 01:00:25.354
to cure zombies but it requires
an adequate delivery system.

01:00:25.356 --> 01:00:28.090
Kill cliff is that
delivery system.

01:00:28.092 --> 01:00:30.626
It's unique blends of
caffeine and vitamins

01:00:30.628 --> 01:00:32.761
creates a covalent bond
shell with the viper semen,

01:00:32.763 --> 01:00:36.698
protects it, while it
infiltrates the zombie cells.

01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:38.066
I kind of would of
that it been obvious.

01:00:38.068 --> 01:00:40.168
- You this man is cured.

01:00:40.170 --> 01:00:41.336
Kiwi, come here,
come here, come here.

01:00:41.338 --> 01:00:42.304
- Aye aye, sir.

01:00:42.306 --> 01:00:43.705
- Davis, get this to the lab.

01:00:43.707 --> 01:00:46.008
Have them replicate it
as fast as possible.

01:00:46.010 --> 01:00:48.310
- It will be a
pleasure and privilege

01:00:48.312 --> 01:00:51.179
and to you gentlemen,
i say bravo.

01:00:51.181 --> 01:00:53.048
- Bravo indeed, kiwi.

01:00:54.283 --> 01:00:56.418
- It's hard to be excited.

01:01:01.891 --> 01:01:05.894
Oh, that's a whole lot of
fucking freedom right there.

01:01:05.896 --> 01:01:07.996
- That's a lot of
hard dick right there.

01:01:07.998 --> 01:01:09.398
- God damn right.

01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:19.675
- Mat, you're alive.

01:01:24.414 --> 01:01:26.682
- Bro, I thought we lost you.

01:01:26.684 --> 01:01:28.016
- Not gonna lie, i
thought I was more fucked

01:01:28.018 --> 01:01:29.184
than jt on a low carb diet.

01:01:30.721 --> 01:01:33.255
But then, the zombie slaying
dream team showed up.

01:01:33.257 --> 01:01:35.257
- There's only a few pairs
of perfect cheekbones

01:01:35.259 --> 01:01:36.458
in this world.

01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:37.859
It would of been a
shame to lose yours.

01:01:37.861 --> 01:01:40.729
- Besides, we let you die,

01:01:40.731 --> 01:01:42.731
what were chinny chinny
bang bang and tactical Randy

01:01:42.733 --> 01:01:43.965
gonna do?

01:01:43.967 --> 01:01:46.368
- It's been a long
couple of days.

01:01:48.171 --> 01:01:50.038
- I hate to break up
this little dick dance

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:51.973
but fixed wing assets are
showing a horde of zombies

01:01:51.975 --> 01:01:53.141
heading right this way.

01:01:53.143 --> 01:01:55.010
Our doors aren't
gonna hold them back.

01:01:55.012 --> 01:01:56.278
- Fuck it.

01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:57.379
You all wanna get nasty?

01:01:57.381 --> 01:01:58.780
- Fuck yeah!

01:01:58.782 --> 01:01:59.748
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
there high speeds,

01:01:59.750 --> 01:02:01.817
you're not in proper uniforms.

01:02:01.819 --> 01:02:03.385
Oh you're haircut
is way out of rank.

01:02:03.387 --> 01:02:05.287
Get your hands out
of your pockets.

01:02:06.156 --> 01:02:08.256
Why is your hand wet?

01:02:08.258 --> 01:02:10.025
Is that a dick hanging out?

01:02:10.027 --> 01:02:12.360
I went to college, I'm not
afraid of running you off...

01:02:12.362 --> 01:02:13.295
- smell this.

01:02:13.297 --> 01:02:14.429
- Was that your butt hole?

01:02:14.431 --> 01:02:15.897
You need to shave.

01:02:15.899 --> 01:02:19.101
I expect salutes
next time, gentlemen.

01:02:23.842 --> 01:02:24.741
Oh shit.

01:02:24.742 --> 01:02:29.511
Fuck you guys, I'm gonna
save the world all by myself.

01:02:29.513 --> 01:02:31.179
Come on, mother
fuckers, bring it on.

01:02:32.783 --> 01:02:35.317
- Just in case we all die,
i want you two to know,

01:02:35.319 --> 01:02:36.885
huge fan.

01:02:36.887 --> 01:02:38.820
I fucking love you guys.

01:02:38.822 --> 01:02:41.189
- Wait, who are these guys?

01:02:41.191 --> 01:02:42.824
- They're heroes.

01:02:44.327 --> 01:02:46.528
- I'm sorry, heroes of what?

01:02:48.232 --> 01:02:49.765
- What the fuck?

01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:52.534
- Sorry bout your friend.

01:02:52.536 --> 01:02:54.469
- Yeah sorry about
your loss and stuff.

01:02:54.471 --> 01:02:55.771
Let's all take a
moment of silence

01:02:55.773 --> 01:02:57.372
for Beatrice's sacrifice.

01:02:57.374 --> 01:02:59.374
- It's Eliza!

01:03:00.476 --> 01:03:01.476
- Okay, ready to
kill some zombies?

01:03:01.478 --> 01:03:02.811
- Yeah.

01:03:04.347 --> 01:03:08.049
- I'm gonna miss you,
fucking stupid whore.

01:03:10.219 --> 01:03:12.487
You fucking annoying bitch.

01:03:15.324 --> 01:03:17.125
God you're so gross.

01:03:47.857 --> 01:03:50.425
- I can't stop killing.

01:04:07.543 --> 01:04:10.145
- Look up there, on the hill.

01:04:37.607 --> 01:04:40.275
- I'll take the girl!

01:04:42.446 --> 01:04:43.446
No, no, no.

01:04:48.618 --> 01:04:49.484
Bitch.

01:04:49.486 --> 01:04:51.186
Not my cucumber, no, no.

01:05:13.476 --> 01:05:15.210
- Hey, why don't
we just fucking shoot em?

01:05:17.948 --> 01:05:19.080
- Go home.

01:05:19.082 --> 01:05:20.348
- That was easy.

01:05:29.025 --> 01:05:31.393
- Oh fuck, is that
Randy couture.

01:05:31.395 --> 01:05:33.595
- No, it's zombie couture.

01:05:44.006 --> 01:05:45.340
- I've got this.

01:05:51.448 --> 01:05:55.483
- Unbelievable, we are here
at the sold out range 15 area

01:05:55.485 --> 01:05:58.186
and this desert
valley is electric.

01:05:58.188 --> 01:05:59.955
- Tim, will you
stop dicking around,

01:05:59.957 --> 01:06:00.956
we don't have any time for...

01:06:00.958 --> 01:06:01.556
- shirts?

01:06:01.558 --> 01:06:02.558
I know.

01:06:05.995 --> 01:06:07.595
- Tim Kennedy versus
zombie Randy couture

01:06:07.597 --> 01:06:09.631
is a fight that many
people wished for

01:06:09.633 --> 01:06:11.533
but never thought
would actually happen.

01:06:11.535 --> 01:06:14.402
- One has to wonder
thought how being a zombie

01:06:14.404 --> 01:06:16.204
will affect the former champion.

01:06:16.206 --> 01:06:18.239
- And that's the question
everyone's asking, Mike

01:06:18.241 --> 01:06:20.742
Randy couture's always been
a very cerebral fighter

01:06:20.744 --> 01:06:23.311
but with the lack of a fully
functioning frontal lobe,

01:06:23.313 --> 01:06:25.013
how will this impact his style?

01:06:25.015 --> 01:06:28.550
- I got an idea,
let's do this thing.

01:06:28.552 --> 01:06:31.486
This fight is brought to you
buy north American rescue,

01:06:31.488 --> 01:06:34.222
federal resources
supply company,

01:06:34.224 --> 01:06:37.025
and the xtreme
couture gi foundation.

01:06:37.027 --> 01:06:38.360
Now, here we go.

01:06:43.066 --> 01:06:44.733
- Holy shit, I can't
believe this determines

01:06:44.735 --> 01:06:47.469
how the fucking world ends!

01:06:47.471 --> 01:06:51.072
Really fucked up,
like really fucked up.

01:06:58.014 --> 01:07:00.248
- Kennedy appears to
have really been working

01:07:00.250 --> 01:07:01.683
on his stand up game, Brian.

01:07:01.685 --> 01:07:04.386
He looks very alive out there.

01:07:04.388 --> 01:07:06.621
- I see what you
did there, Mike.

01:07:06.623 --> 01:07:08.056
- He's rocked, Brian.

01:07:08.058 --> 01:07:11.092
Kennedy could lose here
and life as we know it

01:07:11.094 --> 01:07:12.094
could end.

01:07:20.770 --> 01:07:23.671
- Hey, never count out a
Greg Jackson trained fighter.

01:07:23.673 --> 01:07:26.341
Tim Kennedy was born to
be underneath other men.

01:07:31.147 --> 01:07:32.714
- Hurry this up,
Tim, I'm hungry.

01:07:32.716 --> 01:07:34.115
I want snacks!

01:07:41.590 --> 01:07:44.225
- Fuck him up, fuck him up.

01:07:44.227 --> 01:07:47.395
Fuck him, fuck him, put it in!

01:07:47.397 --> 01:07:48.397
Yeah.

01:07:54.336 --> 01:07:55.837
- He's got the kimura, Brian.

01:07:57.174 --> 01:07:59.574
But, it doesn't
really fucking matter

01:07:59.576 --> 01:08:01.109
because he's a zombie.

01:08:01.111 --> 01:08:04.345
- Got to admire the
toughness of zombie couture

01:08:04.347 --> 01:08:06.781
and you really have to hand
it to Tim Kennedy here.

01:08:06.783 --> 01:08:10.085
He's keeping Randy
at arm's length.

01:08:10.087 --> 01:08:11.586
- I got my arm pulled off too.

01:08:11.588 --> 01:08:13.354
Rip off the other one!

01:08:13.356 --> 01:08:17.158
- Kennedy shoots and
he lands the take down.

01:08:20.363 --> 01:08:22.397
Oh Kennedy's locked in
the rear naked choke.

01:08:22.399 --> 01:08:23.497
That's in deep, Brian.

01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:25.265
- But hey, couture won't tap.

01:08:26.336 --> 01:08:28.803
Whoa, it as all over.

01:08:28.805 --> 01:08:30.839
Great heads up
move by Tim Kennedy

01:08:30.841 --> 01:08:33.274
to win that fight
and save our asses.

01:08:42.350 --> 01:08:44.118
- Fuck yeah, fuck yeah!

01:08:44.121 --> 01:08:46.888
Fucking ruin his credit score.

01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:56.331
- That's some bad ass shit, Tim.

01:08:56.332 --> 01:08:59.399
Wait, why the fuck did we
leave our guns back there?

01:08:59.402 --> 01:09:01.569
- How else are we gonna
have a final epic battle?

01:09:01.571 --> 01:09:03.705
- Wait, epic battle?

01:09:03.707 --> 01:09:06.841
I am so tired of you guys
smashing your dicks together.

01:09:06.843 --> 01:09:07.843
Fuck this.

01:09:14.151 --> 01:09:15.582
- Just when you thought
the night couldn't

01:09:15.585 --> 01:09:19.654
get any more intense,
it's Danny trejo's zombie.

01:09:19.656 --> 01:09:21.523
- Who the fuck saw this coming.

01:09:30.232 --> 01:09:31.198
- That's all me.

01:09:31.201 --> 01:09:33.468
- Over my dead body.

01:09:33.470 --> 01:09:35.502
- You know, Mike, Danny
trejo was the San Quentin

01:09:35.505 --> 01:09:37.238
boxing champion for five years

01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:38.773
in two different weight classes.

01:09:38.774 --> 01:09:41.709
However, one has to wonder
what a voracious appetite

01:09:41.711 --> 01:09:43.545
for human flesh and an inability

01:09:43.546 --> 01:09:45.913
to feel pain will do
for his skill set.

01:09:45.916 --> 01:09:48.883
- Looks once again like
we're about to find out.

01:09:48.885 --> 01:09:50.385
- I got this!

01:09:50.386 --> 01:09:52.187
- Tom is making a classical
mistake here, Mike,

01:09:52.189 --> 01:09:54.822
in that he really doesn't
know that the fuck he's doing.

01:09:54.824 --> 01:09:57.358
Danny trejo is a
certified bad ass

01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:58.960
who now has supernatural powers.

01:09:58.962 --> 01:10:00.628
- He's a little fuck, isn't he?

01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:03.431
- Good initiative, bad judgment.

01:10:06.202 --> 01:10:07.769
- Who's the mother
fucking hero now?

01:10:07.771 --> 01:10:09.637
- Man, jumping on dud
doesn't meant shit.

01:10:10.507 --> 01:10:11.706
Mother fucker!

01:10:12.775 --> 01:10:13.908
- He's hurt, Brian.

01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:15.577
- Now put a cat
tourniquet on this.

01:10:18.748 --> 01:10:21.216
Come on, hurry the fuck up.

01:10:22.518 --> 01:10:24.919
- I'm trying, quit squirting.

01:10:27.289 --> 01:10:28.790
- I got this.

01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:31.960
- Mike, it looks
like they're gonna

01:10:31.962 --> 01:10:33.528
go with the team approach now.

01:10:33.530 --> 01:10:35.697
In the military, we call
this an envelopment,

01:10:35.699 --> 01:10:37.632
where you surround the
enemy and force him

01:10:37.634 --> 01:10:39.467
to fight you on
multiple directions.

01:10:42.572 --> 01:10:46.641
Or, they're just gonna
go at him one by one.

01:10:46.643 --> 01:10:47.842
Like fucking morons.

01:10:47.844 --> 01:10:49.510
- Straight shot to
the wedding tackle,

01:10:49.512 --> 01:10:51.279
Brian, it's all over.

01:10:51.281 --> 01:10:53.348
- And then he popped
his favorite sex doll.

01:10:53.350 --> 01:10:55.984
Trejo remains cold as ice.

01:10:55.986 --> 01:10:57.652
- Careful, guys.

01:10:57.654 --> 01:11:00.655
- I'm big as fuck
bro, he can't hurt me.

01:11:07.296 --> 01:11:08.596
- Wow, Mike, he just
chopped him down

01:11:08.598 --> 01:11:10.465
like a wet pine tree.

01:11:10.467 --> 01:11:12.367
Is it me or did you think
he'd have a better chin?

01:11:12.369 --> 01:11:14.836
- Well, I think he would
of had a better chin.

01:11:14.838 --> 01:11:17.805
We're down to two and
he's taunting them.

01:11:17.807 --> 01:11:20.842
Trejo is really a
next level zombie.

01:11:20.844 --> 01:11:20.842
- Yeah, I hate to say it,

01:11:20.844 --> 01:11:23.845
cause it likely means
the end of the world,

01:11:23.847 --> 01:11:26.581
but he's just at a different
zombie level right now.

01:11:26.583 --> 01:11:28.916
- Eeeny, meany, meenie, moe!

01:11:31.687 --> 01:11:33.054
- Looks like
zombie trejo's identified

01:11:33.056 --> 01:11:34.589
his next victim, Mike.

01:11:36.993 --> 01:11:38.793
- Wow, that was just bad.

01:11:38.795 --> 01:11:40.595
- He's air force, Mike.

01:11:40.597 --> 01:11:42.030
- And we're down to one.

01:11:42.032 --> 01:11:44.432
Looks like Nick
is rushing trejo.

01:11:44.434 --> 01:11:47.435
Well that worked
out great for, tom.

01:11:47.437 --> 01:11:50.004
He's teeing off, he
won't remember this.

01:11:50.006 --> 01:11:52.073
- Like a goat at an
Isis convention, Mike,

01:11:52.075 --> 01:11:53.341
he's fucked.

01:11:54.476 --> 01:11:55.710
- What are we doing?

01:11:55.712 --> 01:11:57.392
- We have to get to a
place of observation.

01:12:07.589 --> 01:12:10.091
- Here comes the fatal bite.

01:12:10.093 --> 01:12:11.959
Saved by Kennedy.

01:12:11.961 --> 01:12:13.361
I'm worried here, Mike.

01:12:13.363 --> 01:12:15.029
Tim is still exhausted
from zombie couture.

01:12:15.031 --> 01:12:17.031
- Now, lets not count
Kennedy out yet.

01:12:17.033 --> 01:12:19.434
As a special forces operator,

01:12:19.436 --> 01:12:21.803
he's been in worse
spots then this.

01:12:21.805 --> 01:12:23.671
- I'm pretty sure
that's not true.

01:12:23.673 --> 01:12:24.872
- Trejo!

01:12:24.874 --> 01:12:25.907
- Now what just one minute.

01:12:25.909 --> 01:12:25.907
- Mat is still up.

01:12:25.909 --> 01:12:28.476
- This guys kinda
growing on me, Brian.

01:12:28.478 --> 01:12:30.378
- Like e coli on
pig carcass, Mike.

01:12:45.861 --> 01:12:47.495
- Thanks man.

01:12:47.497 --> 01:12:49.630
- I owed you for earlier.

01:12:50.799 --> 01:12:52.667
It's a fucked up day.

01:12:53.802 --> 01:12:57.038
- I loved him in machete.

01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:59.140
- Blue leader six,
this is striker 3-1.

01:12:59.142 --> 01:13:00.908
Give me some nam cans
on the remainders.

01:13:00.910 --> 01:13:03.678
Get it out to me, Sandy,
I'd do it for you!

01:13:40.883 --> 01:13:41.949
- We did it.

01:13:42.851 --> 01:13:44.485
We saved America.

01:13:45.521 --> 01:13:47.955
- America sure is
beautiful, isn't she?

01:13:47.957 --> 01:13:49.490
- How beautiful?

01:14:37.639 --> 01:14:39.106
- I want to see every single
one of you mother fuckers

01:14:39.108 --> 01:14:41.509
in the hallway, right now!

01:14:44.146 --> 01:14:45.079
- Morning, colonel.

01:14:45.081 --> 01:14:47.915
- At ease, you son of a bitch.

01:14:47.917 --> 01:14:49.550
I can't believe you did it.

01:14:49.552 --> 01:14:51.586
- I can't believe
you doubted the team.

01:14:51.588 --> 01:14:53.521
- That's just as well.

01:14:53.523 --> 01:14:55.590
The president will be
coming in at 0900 hours

01:14:55.592 --> 01:14:56.958
to address the nation.

01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:58.693
He wants you front and
center with him on stage

01:14:58.695 --> 01:15:00.695
as he makes his speech.

01:15:00.697 --> 01:15:02.063
You're a hero.

01:15:02.065 --> 01:15:04.065
- Sorry sir, but I'm not
going up on that podium

01:15:04.067 --> 01:15:05.099
without the team.

01:15:05.101 --> 01:15:07.101
We did this together.

01:15:07.103 --> 01:15:09.270
- Selfless, I like that.

01:15:09.272 --> 01:15:11.072
You and your entire
team can be on stage

01:15:11.074 --> 01:15:12.807
for the big moment.

01:15:13.942 --> 01:15:16.210
You guys did a great
thing for your country.

01:15:16.212 --> 01:15:18.012
It's only right you
should all be there.

01:15:18.014 --> 01:15:18.880
- Thank you, colonel.

01:15:18.882 --> 01:15:20.281
- No, thank you.

01:15:20.283 --> 01:15:23.050
You're finally living up
to your potential, mat.

01:15:23.052 --> 01:15:25.052
And I was wrong about you.

01:15:25.054 --> 01:15:26.087
You guys have a couple of hours

01:15:26.089 --> 01:15:28.556
to go in and get
something to eat

01:15:28.558 --> 01:15:30.858
and if you want to be on stage,

01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:32.760
I suggest you figure out
a way to get that doll

01:15:32.762 --> 01:15:34.228
of your cock, son.

01:15:36.031 --> 01:15:38.165
- Sir, one more thing.

01:15:38.167 --> 01:15:40.701
Did you just decide not
to shave this morning or?

01:15:40.703 --> 01:15:42.637
- It's the end of
the world, fuck you.

01:15:43.907 --> 01:15:45.106
- I'm sure the
scientists have something

01:15:45.108 --> 01:15:48.876
to take your doll
of your dick, dude.

01:15:48.878 --> 01:15:51.646
- What if I don't want it off?

01:15:51.648 --> 01:15:53.781
- What, what do you mean?

01:15:54.783 --> 01:15:56.317
- There is no glue.

01:15:59.121 --> 01:16:00.888
It's just velcro.

01:16:00.890 --> 01:16:05.793
Tanisha, she's more than a
rubber fuck puppet to me.

01:16:05.795 --> 01:16:06.894
She's therapy.

01:16:07.864 --> 01:16:10.598
She's my security blanket.

01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:11.899
My best friend.

01:16:13.168 --> 01:16:14.268
She's the only person I know

01:16:14.270 --> 01:16:16.671
that I can really open up to.

01:16:16.673 --> 01:16:18.906
I mean really open up to.

01:16:18.908 --> 01:16:22.176
She doesn't judge
me, she just listens.

01:16:23.579 --> 01:16:25.179
- I had no idea man.

01:16:26.582 --> 01:16:27.815
- Everybody thought
i went to Wal-Mart

01:16:27.817 --> 01:16:29.250
to get some sort
of epoxy remover

01:16:29.252 --> 01:16:31.352
to get her off my Johnson

01:16:32.788 --> 01:16:37.325
but the truth is, I just wanted
to take her out on a date.

01:16:41.930 --> 01:16:43.998
I love you, brother.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.600
- Love you too man

01:16:45.602 --> 01:16:49.804
but I'm gonna need you to
get your dick off of me.

01:16:51.940 --> 01:16:55.643
- Alright, let me get a
little fresh air exposed

01:16:55.645 --> 01:16:57.178
to it for a minute.

01:16:58.013 --> 01:16:59.647
- Why don't you take a couple

01:16:59.649 --> 01:17:02.316
and go regroup yourself, right?

01:17:02.318 --> 01:17:03.384
Thanks, bro.

01:17:07.789 --> 01:17:09.657
- I gotta bounce, bro.

01:17:09.659 --> 01:17:12.259
- The president is on
his way here right now.

01:17:12.261 --> 01:17:13.961
- Yeah, but I have
some stuff I got

01:17:13.963 --> 01:17:15.129
to take care of bro.

01:17:15.131 --> 01:17:17.798
- Shit bigger than
the president?

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:18.800
- Yeah.

01:17:20.736 --> 01:17:21.836
Sorry, bro.

01:17:21.838 --> 01:17:22.838
Gotta go.

01:17:24.339 --> 01:17:25.740
- Are you hungry dude?

01:17:25.742 --> 01:17:26.674
- Yeah man.

01:17:26.676 --> 01:17:28.275
Let's go get some food.

01:17:28.277 --> 01:17:29.777
You guys want anything?

01:17:29.779 --> 01:17:31.212
- Yeah, we'll be
there in a minute.

01:17:31.214 --> 01:17:32.214
- Alright.

01:17:33.415 --> 01:17:35.249
- Crazy couple of days, huh?

01:17:35.251 --> 01:17:36.717
- Yeah, I'm exhausted.

01:17:36.719 --> 01:17:38.853
- So, I was thinking,

01:17:38.855 --> 01:17:41.022
maybe after this whole
thing blows over,

01:17:41.024 --> 01:17:43.724
you and I can like
get away or something.

01:17:43.726 --> 01:17:44.725
- Yeah, fuck it.

01:17:44.727 --> 01:17:45.393
Let's do...

01:17:45.395 --> 01:17:47.228
You broke me down.

01:17:47.230 --> 01:17:48.262
Let's do it.

01:17:48.264 --> 01:17:50.164
Let's go to sandals Jamaica.

01:17:50.166 --> 01:17:53.134
We just lay in bed
and order room service

01:17:53.136 --> 01:17:56.804
for fuel to fuck each
others brains out

01:17:56.806 --> 01:18:00.374
all day, all night,
is that what you want?

01:18:02.111 --> 01:18:03.111
Yeah.

01:18:05.881 --> 01:18:09.250
I'll tell you what, you
lose a little bit of weight,

01:18:09.252 --> 01:18:12.853
get yourself down to a cool 185,

01:18:12.855 --> 01:18:15.122
I'll make that happen.

01:18:15.124 --> 01:18:16.123
Deal?

01:18:16.125 --> 01:18:18.159
- Oh yes, deal.

01:18:18.161 --> 01:18:19.161
- Great.

01:18:19.995 --> 01:18:21.362
You want some food?

01:18:21.364 --> 01:18:25.032
There's a truckload of
freedom fudge outside.

01:18:25.034 --> 01:18:28.169
- Well, I probably shouldn't.

01:18:28.171 --> 01:18:31.205
Technically I haven't slept
so it's still my cheat day.

01:18:31.207 --> 01:18:33.207
- Yeah of course, sure.

01:18:35.143 --> 01:18:36.811
- In a few moments,
the president

01:18:36.813 --> 01:18:39.780
will speak live about
the military containment

01:18:39.782 --> 01:18:42.049
of the mysterious
virus that has plagued

01:18:42.051 --> 01:18:44.752
the United States and
neighboring countries

01:18:44.754 --> 01:18:48.355
in north and south America
for the last three days.

01:18:48.357 --> 01:18:51.425
It is believed that one
of them is responsible

01:18:51.427 --> 01:18:52.960
for saving man kind.

01:18:58.834 --> 01:19:03.404
- My fellow Americans, as
you are all painfully aware,

01:19:03.406 --> 01:19:06.207
the last few days since
the crash of an aircraft

01:19:06.209 --> 01:19:10.211
carrying an unknown virus,
have been full of sorrow,

01:19:10.213 --> 01:19:12.747
heartache, and deep despair.

01:19:14.282 --> 01:19:18.452
We lost nearly half of our
population in the outbreak

01:19:18.454 --> 01:19:19.754
and that's a loss...

01:19:19.756 --> 01:19:21.455
- Holy shit, Marcus you made it?

01:19:21.457 --> 01:19:22.857
- Damn right.

01:19:22.859 --> 01:19:26.827
I'm Marcus luttrell,
fucking live forever.

01:19:26.829 --> 01:19:31.198
- Can't you seals just let
us have one fucking movie?

01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:32.800
- Absolutely not.

01:19:34.469 --> 01:19:37.404
- I hate to single
out individuals

01:19:38.774 --> 01:19:41.275
but there is one
man who's courage,

01:19:41.277 --> 01:19:43.477
who's actions, who's
tenacity stood head

01:19:43.479 --> 01:19:46.280
and shoulders above all others.

01:19:46.282 --> 01:19:49.850
This is a man who truly
understands the concept

01:19:49.852 --> 01:19:52.286
of country before self.

01:19:52.288 --> 01:19:53.454
- It's fucking you man.

01:19:53.456 --> 01:19:54.421
- It's fucking us.

01:19:54.423 --> 01:19:56.357
- He saved our way of life,

01:19:56.359 --> 01:19:58.392
he saved America.

01:19:58.394 --> 01:20:00.928
Ladies and gentleman,

01:20:00.930 --> 01:20:02.830
sergeant major gene vandenham.

01:20:07.969 --> 01:20:11.972
- I want to you know, you're
still 2nd best in my eyes.

01:20:11.974 --> 01:20:15.109
I'm proud of the man you
might become one day.

01:20:19.115 --> 01:20:22.850
- You know when I saw
that video of gene

01:20:22.852 --> 01:20:24.819
taken from one of
our space satellites,

01:20:24.821 --> 01:20:28.155
I just knew that we would
have to give him yet another

01:20:28.157 --> 01:20:29.023
medal of honor.

01:20:29.025 --> 01:20:30.357
Well done, gene.

01:20:34.996 --> 01:20:39.300
What marvelous images, in the
midst of a zombie apocalypse,

01:20:39.302 --> 01:20:42.303
gene get's this
incredible video.

01:20:42.305 --> 01:20:46.507
He took the crew and the
camera and shot it himself.

01:20:50.213 --> 01:20:51.979
- Also, there's a
promotional video

01:20:51.981 --> 01:20:53.514
that's gonna be out
of me killing zombies,

01:20:53.516 --> 01:20:56.016
in about 13 days
it's gonna be $69.99,

01:20:56.018 --> 01:20:58.586
that's eight easy installments.

01:21:00.021 --> 01:21:01.021
- Lots of people
wonder what they would

01:21:01.023 --> 01:21:03.557
do if the world is ending.

01:21:03.559 --> 01:21:06.026
Our story might not be normal

01:21:06.028 --> 01:21:09.096
but I learned some
important life lessons.

01:21:09.098 --> 01:21:11.465
Tim Kennedy's abs
are to die for.

01:21:11.467 --> 01:21:14.435
That was pun for
you, the audience.

01:21:14.437 --> 01:21:16.971
Also, jt will never get laid

01:21:18.306 --> 01:21:21.475
and killing zombies was
actually pretty easy.

01:21:21.477 --> 01:21:23.477
Thanks global war on terror.

01:21:23.479 --> 01:21:27.882
And most importantly, love
is the most powerful emotion

01:21:29.184 --> 01:21:32.987
and Rocco, well he found
love in a hopeless place.

01:29:00.768 --> 01:29:01.601
- God damn, mat.

01:29:01.603 --> 01:29:02.936
Wake the fuck up.

01:29:02.938 --> 01:29:06.406
Your phone's been ringing
all fucking morning.

01:29:08.710 --> 01:29:09.710
- What?

01:29:11.112 --> 01:29:12.112
Oh my god.

01:29:14.382 --> 01:29:15.916
- What the fuck was that?

01:29:15.918 --> 01:29:18.685
- You would think
saving the fucking world

01:29:18.687 --> 01:29:19.886
would let you keep your job

01:29:19.888 --> 01:29:21.655
but I'm fired, again.

01:29:21.657 --> 01:29:21.655
- If you want, I can
always get you a job

01:29:21.657 --> 01:29:24.891
as a janitor at the all
girls college I work at.

01:29:24.893 --> 01:29:27.060
- Why didn't we
think of that before?

01:29:27.062 --> 01:29:28.128
- Consider it done.
