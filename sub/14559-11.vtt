WEBVTT

00:08.742 --> 00:09.943
It's been nearly a week

00:10.010 --> 00:12.046
since veteran investigative
reporter Bonnie Parks

00:12.113 --> 00:14.215
was reported missing.

00:14.282 --> 00:16.817
Now the FBI has joined
the investigation

00:16.884 --> 00:18.586
into her disappearance.

00:18.652 --> 00:20.488
Bureau officials have been
tight-lipped about

00:20.554 --> 00:22.423
their involvement, saying it's
too soon to comment.

00:22.490 --> 00:25.859
So, for now, Parks' whereabouts
and fate remain a mystery.

00:25.926 --> 00:27.595
The security guard called in
the plates after he realized

00:27.661 --> 00:29.930
the car had been here
a couple of days.

00:29.997 --> 00:31.099
Checked out surveillance video.

00:31.165 --> 00:32.966
It shows Bonnie Parks
entered the lot

00:33.033 --> 00:34.068
at 10:08 Tuesday morning.

00:34.135 --> 00:35.336
Are we sure it was her?

00:35.403 --> 00:37.471
No question. From what
I can tell, she was alone.

00:40.074 --> 00:41.809
Joining me is
Professor Charles Eppes,

00:41.875 --> 00:45.446
a Cal Sci mathematician who
frequently consults for the FBI.

00:45.513 --> 00:47.581
Are you here to help the FBI
find Bonnie Parks?

00:47.648 --> 00:49.483
You know what?
I'm not at liberty to say.

00:49.550 --> 00:50.751
It's an ongoing investigation.

00:50.818 --> 00:54.688
Your brother Special Agent Don
Eppes is the lead investigator

00:54.755 --> 00:55.756
on the case.

00:55.823 --> 00:57.625
You've done your homework.

00:57.691 --> 01:00.328
Uh, I hope to help
in whatever way I can.

01:00.394 --> 01:03.631
Hopefully, we can find out
what happened to her.

01:03.697 --> 01:05.366
DAVID: Interviewed shop owners
and employees.

01:05.433 --> 01:06.800
Some remember her from TV,

01:06.867 --> 01:09.537
but no one actually remembers
seeing her.

01:09.603 --> 01:10.904
COLBY: Surveillance cameras
never picked her up entering,

01:10.971 --> 01:13.674
so she didn't even make it
into the mall.

01:13.741 --> 01:15.343
In a missing persons case
like this

01:15.409 --> 01:17.678
there's any number
of analyses we can perform.

01:17.745 --> 01:21.149
For instance, we know
Miss Parks' car was recovered

01:21.215 --> 01:22.516
at the San Marino Mall.

01:22.583 --> 01:23.717
Based on
traffic-flow patterns,

01:23.784 --> 01:27.921
I can construct a probable
egress path away from that area.

01:27.988 --> 01:30.558
Maybe she was followed, maybe
she was meeting a source.

01:30.624 --> 01:33.060
Yeah. I mean, all we know
is she rolled in the parking lot

01:33.127 --> 01:34.295
Tuesday morning
at 10:08;

01:34.362 --> 01:36.096
she parked her car...

01:36.164 --> 01:37.598
Then she vanished.

01:37.665 --> 01:39.099
CHARLIE: We know that Miss
Parks-- through her work--

01:39.167 --> 01:40.434
made a number of enemies.

01:40.501 --> 01:44.438
We can mathematically evaluate
each of those enemies

01:44.505 --> 01:46.474
to determine what threat
they might pose.

01:46.540 --> 01:49.477
But it's still early
and still gathering data.

01:49.543 --> 01:51.745
REPORTER: Is your presence here
going to be the difference

01:51.812 --> 01:53.981
between finding or not finding
Bonnie Parks?

01:54.047 --> 01:56.784
CHARLIE: I hope to find her,
if that's what you mean.

01:56.850 --> 01:58.486
It's a cardinal rule:

01:58.552 --> 02:00.488
you don't discuss
an ongoing investigation.

02:00.554 --> 02:02.022
ALAN:
Don, I don't really think

02:02.089 --> 02:04.358
he disclosed that much
about the case.

02:04.425 --> 02:06.026
Well, Dad, the Assistant
Director thinks different.

02:06.093 --> 02:07.228
I'm really sorry.

02:07.295 --> 02:08.529
Well, it
doesn't matter,

02:08.596 --> 02:10.698
Charlie, you're sorry;
the damage is done.

02:13.834 --> 02:14.835
Where are you going?

02:16.304 --> 02:19.340
To Cal Sci to do the work
that I didn't do

02:19.407 --> 02:21.542
because I was helping Don.

02:23.744 --> 02:26.880
He's not one
of your agents.

02:26.947 --> 02:28.148
You know that, right?

02:30.951 --> 02:33.887
(sighs)
Forget about it. It's nothing.

02:42.095 --> 02:42.830
Thanks, dopey.

02:42.896 --> 02:44.532
I don't really need to see
while I'm driving.

02:47.768 --> 02:49.370
Gee.

02:49.437 --> 02:51.705
All right, fine. You know what?
Go ahead. Go ahead.

03:13.394 --> 03:14.828
(tires squeal)

03:21.769 --> 03:23.937
(tires squealing)

03:25.806 --> 03:28.208
What do you want?

04:01.241 --> 04:03.344
(knock at door)

04:03.411 --> 04:05.313
I come beseechingly.

04:05.379 --> 04:07.448
In my effort to rid my office
of clutter,

04:07.515 --> 04:09.683
I may have dispensed
with certain staple items,

04:09.750 --> 04:13.020
my copy of Fisher & Boyd
being one of them.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.021
You want to borrow mine.

04:15.055 --> 04:15.956
Here.

04:16.023 --> 04:17.224
Ah.

04:17.291 --> 04:18.692
(knock at door)

04:18.759 --> 04:19.527
Oh, hey, Larry.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.194
Hey.
-Charlie.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.863
Did you sleep
here last night?

04:22.930 --> 04:24.832
Uh... yeah.

04:24.898 --> 04:27.067
I didn't realize
you had so much work.

04:27.134 --> 04:27.968
I would have helped.

04:28.035 --> 04:29.269
It wasn't work.

04:29.337 --> 04:31.439
I think I was kind of

04:31.505 --> 04:33.374
being followed last night.

04:33.441 --> 04:34.408
What do you mean? Where?

04:34.475 --> 04:35.709
In my car
on the way here.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.845
I'm probably
just being paranoid.

04:37.911 --> 04:40.914
Maybe you accidentally cut
somebody off in traffic.

04:40.981 --> 04:43.317
I mean, your driving
is questionable.

04:43.384 --> 04:45.553
There's nothing wrong
with my driving.

04:45.619 --> 04:49.189
So the chorus of car horns
that follows in your wake...

04:49.256 --> 04:49.857
(both laughing)

04:49.923 --> 04:52.393
What is that?
A spontaneous phenomenon?

04:52.460 --> 04:54.328
Um, did you talk to Don?

04:54.395 --> 04:56.129
What did he say?

04:56.196 --> 04:58.832
(sighs)
Don...

04:58.899 --> 05:01.402
I'm supposed to be at the FBI
right now.

05:03.136 --> 05:04.237
Ah, great.

05:04.304 --> 05:08.308
This is one more thing
for him to give me crap about.

05:08.376 --> 05:10.511
Charles, is everything
all right?

05:14.314 --> 05:16.316
PARKS:
Despite assurances from all six

05:16.384 --> 05:17.551
of the Mexican pharmacies
we visited,

05:17.618 --> 05:21.054
our investigation found
that nearly half

05:21.121 --> 05:23.591
of all the drugs dispensed
to American patients

05:23.657 --> 05:26.427
were either mislabeled,
expired

05:26.494 --> 05:27.928
or placebo,

05:27.995 --> 05:30.398
a dangerous health fraud
that could have serious,

05:30.464 --> 05:31.999
even fatal consequences.

05:32.065 --> 05:33.133
The woman's got guts.

05:33.200 --> 05:35.603
In the last six years, she's
taken on just about everybody:

05:35.669 --> 05:38.472
the Mexican Mafia,
crooked Border Patrol agents,

05:38.539 --> 05:41.308
bad cops, judges, mayors.

05:41.375 --> 05:42.810
So she's got plenty of enemies.

05:42.876 --> 05:44.512
Yeah, I counted 28 companies
or individuals

05:44.578 --> 05:46.346
who have reason to go after her
for revenge.

05:46.414 --> 05:50.384
I mean, either went to jail,
forced to pay huge fines,

05:50.451 --> 05:52.386
or kicked out of office.

05:52.453 --> 05:54.321
I think I can find a way
to narrow your choices.

05:54.388 --> 05:56.990
Yeah, you mentioned that
in your interview.

05:57.057 --> 05:58.125
Yeah, among other things.

05:58.191 --> 06:03.096
Uh, it's called
an asymmetric threat assessment.

06:03.163 --> 06:04.432
We've done
threat assessments before,

06:04.498 --> 06:07.501
but I think I can use
this one to analyze

06:07.568 --> 06:09.336
and calculate motive.
-But Charlie,

06:09.403 --> 06:12.440
all 28 of the suspects are
presumably after the same thing:

06:12.506 --> 06:13.407
that's revenge, right?

06:13.474 --> 06:14.875
Yeah, that's true,

06:14.942 --> 06:17.811
but each suspect is motivated
to a different degree.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.547
You know that
carnival game

06:19.613 --> 06:20.881
where you shoot a squirt gun

06:20.948 --> 06:23.484
into a clown's mouth
to fill up a balloon?

06:23.551 --> 06:25.185
An asymmetric threat assessment
allows us

06:25.252 --> 06:29.089
to measure the factors that
feed motive in each suspect

06:29.156 --> 06:31.725
just like the mechanism in the
game measures the flow of water

06:31.792 --> 06:32.560
into each clown's mouth.

06:32.626 --> 06:34.027
It doesn't matter

06:34.094 --> 06:36.396
if the suspects all have
the same motive.

06:36.464 --> 06:37.765
We just have to find

06:37.831 --> 06:40.934
the one case in which motive
has been fed to the point

06:41.001 --> 06:43.303
where the suspect
eventually pops.

06:43.370 --> 06:46.273
And that only considers the
suspects that pose a threat

06:46.339 --> 06:47.340
to Bonnie Parks.

06:47.407 --> 06:48.809
Just as important
are the people

06:48.876 --> 06:51.044
who are afraid of her,
who she threatens.

06:51.111 --> 06:52.145
You mean anyone

06:52.212 --> 06:54.848
she's investigating
who has something to hide.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.049
Do we know
what she was working on?

06:56.116 --> 06:56.950
No, not yet.

06:57.017 --> 06:58.586
We have a meeting set
with her producer.

06:58.652 --> 06:59.687
All right, good.

06:59.753 --> 07:00.721
Well, you know
what to do

07:00.788 --> 07:01.755
and we know
what to do,

07:01.822 --> 07:02.990
so let's get to it.

07:10.664 --> 07:12.199
You coming?

07:12.265 --> 07:13.501
Yeah.

07:13.567 --> 07:15.435
Yeah, yeah.

07:15.503 --> 07:17.538
Hand me the nine-sixteenths,
will ya?

07:17.605 --> 07:18.405
(metallic clanging)

07:18.472 --> 07:20.240
There you go.

07:20.307 --> 07:21.008
Hey, what's goin' on?

07:21.074 --> 07:22.843
Ah, the filter pump's
been making

07:22.910 --> 07:24.211
some horrible sounds lately.

07:24.277 --> 07:25.846
I'm surprised
you hadn't noticed.

07:25.913 --> 07:29.249
Yeah, no, I did.
I just been busy.

07:29.316 --> 07:30.884
Hey, Charlie.
-Ray?

07:30.951 --> 07:33.186
Dad, you called
a tenured university professor

07:33.253 --> 07:34.722
to come and fix the koi pond.

07:34.788 --> 07:37.290
Relax, your dad mentioned
the trouble

07:37.357 --> 07:38.258
the other day after class,

07:38.325 --> 07:40.728
I volunteered. You know I like
to get my hands dirty.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.395
Looks like the
bearings are shot.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.464
Really?

07:44.532 --> 07:45.499
Well, they're easy to replace,
huh?

07:45.566 --> 07:47.601
Yeah, but you might want
to get a new pump.

07:47.668 --> 07:49.503
Old one like this,
it's inefficient.

07:49.570 --> 07:51.471
Gobbles power
like a South American dictator.

07:51.539 --> 07:53.641
Matter of fact,
couple things you could do

07:53.707 --> 07:55.543
to green this old
place up a little.

07:55.609 --> 07:56.910
Probably save money
in the long run,

07:56.977 --> 07:58.879
do the planet a favor
at the same time.

07:58.946 --> 08:00.180
What are you
talking about?

08:00.247 --> 08:03.884
Charlie drives a hybrid.
We're already doing our part.

08:03.951 --> 08:06.053
To tell you the truth, yeah.

08:06.119 --> 08:07.487
It's something
I've been thinking about.

08:07.555 --> 08:09.389
No, come on.
The house is fine.

08:09.456 --> 08:12.726
I mean, it's old,
but it works, you know, mostly.

08:12.793 --> 08:14.628
I mean, it's a lot like me.

08:14.695 --> 08:17.698
(laughing)

08:21.569 --> 08:26.339
Well, you can see
she hardly ever uses it.

08:26.406 --> 08:27.575
Where does she work?

08:27.641 --> 08:29.877
At home probably.
I don't know.

08:29.943 --> 08:32.345
She's always real secretive
during her investigations.

08:32.412 --> 08:34.848
She would work alone until
it was time to start shooting.

08:34.915 --> 08:36.917
So you don't know who she was
currently investigating?

08:36.984 --> 08:37.851
No.

08:37.918 --> 08:39.186
How about someone
in her personal life?

08:39.252 --> 08:41.421
Is there anybody there
who might be able to tell us?

08:41.488 --> 08:42.723
If she had a personal life.

08:42.790 --> 08:44.191
Here's the thing.

08:44.257 --> 08:46.560
Bonnie was always just
about her work.

08:46.627 --> 08:47.861
She was an absolute
professional,

08:47.928 --> 08:50.330
but I never saw her
try to make friends

08:50.397 --> 08:51.632
or even try to be liked.

08:51.699 --> 08:52.933
"101st Airborne."

08:53.000 --> 08:55.636
I used to bunk with some
of these guys in Afghanistan.

08:55.703 --> 08:56.704
That's her younger brother's.

08:56.770 --> 08:58.238
He was killed in Iraq.

08:59.539 --> 09:00.741
What about a computer?

09:00.808 --> 09:02.910
She have a laptop maybe
she takes with her to work?

09:02.976 --> 09:04.211
Bonnie doesn't
use computers.

09:04.277 --> 09:06.479
She doesn't trust
that they are secure.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.381
So she writes everything
out by hand.

09:08.448 --> 09:09.783
She's old school.

09:09.850 --> 09:12.385
Yeah, which means
we go old school.

09:12.452 --> 09:13.386
Check this out.

09:13.453 --> 09:14.354
I can see indentations.

09:14.421 --> 09:15.956
Can you make anything out?

09:16.023 --> 09:17.858
No, but maybe somebody
at the lab can.

09:19.192 --> 09:20.994
What do you think
happened to Bonnie?

09:21.061 --> 09:22.029
I mean,

09:22.095 --> 09:24.264
do you think she's still alive?

09:32.405 --> 09:37.344
I really, really wanted to sneak
up on you and yell, "Boo!"

09:37.410 --> 09:39.446
But I thought it might not be

09:39.512 --> 09:40.113
the best idea right now.

09:40.180 --> 09:42.149
Yeah, I appreciate
the restraint.

09:42.215 --> 09:44.685
You have no idea.

09:46.253 --> 09:47.788
This threat assessment?

09:47.855 --> 09:49.289
Yeah, it's for Don's
missing reporter.

09:49.356 --> 09:53.460
It's running, but I keep
reworking the algorithm.

09:53.526 --> 09:56.496
It's a pretty large value for N.

09:56.563 --> 09:57.497
She had a lot of enemies.

09:57.564 --> 09:59.432
Why does Alan keep grumbling

09:59.499 --> 10:00.868
about Ray trying
to ruin the house?

10:00.934 --> 10:02.369
You know,
I'm not sure

10:02.435 --> 10:03.170
because all Ray's saying

10:03.236 --> 10:04.872
is that he wants
to make the house

10:04.938 --> 10:06.006
a little more eco-friendly

10:06.073 --> 10:07.841
and get off the grid
a little, so...

10:07.908 --> 10:09.276
And Alan's against that?

10:09.342 --> 10:12.012
Wasn't he the biggest
activist hippie in the '60s?

10:12.079 --> 10:14.447
City planning's
all about efficiency.

10:14.514 --> 10:16.349
It doesn't make
any sense.

10:16.416 --> 10:17.818
(computer beeping)

10:21.188 --> 10:22.189
Charlie...

10:23.423 --> 10:25.225
Your computer's done.

10:25.292 --> 10:26.026
Oh.

10:26.593 --> 10:27.961
All right.

10:28.028 --> 10:29.362
I'm gonna take this over to Don.

10:29.429 --> 10:31.464
You want me to ride with you?

10:31.531 --> 10:32.432
No.

10:32.499 --> 10:33.667
Are you sure?

10:33.734 --> 10:35.002
I'll be fine by myself.

10:44.577 --> 10:46.146
(computer beeping)

10:49.049 --> 10:50.517
DON:
What's that, the parking lot?

10:50.583 --> 10:52.185
Yep.

10:52.252 --> 10:54.521
Everything that entered
or left the mall

10:54.587 --> 10:56.156
the morning she pulled in.

10:56.223 --> 10:58.625
Any license plate I can read
I'm running.

10:58.692 --> 11:00.127
That's a lot of plates.

11:00.193 --> 11:04.397
Yeah. So far, she could be
stashed in any one of these.

11:04.464 --> 11:06.433
The guys at the lab
had no problem pulling off

11:06.499 --> 11:08.736
what was on those pads
we found in her office.

11:08.802 --> 11:10.337
It was kind of
interesting.

11:10.403 --> 11:11.304
Take a look at it.

11:11.371 --> 11:13.874
It's, um, it's
just numbers.

11:13.941 --> 11:15.575
There's two full pages of it.

11:15.642 --> 11:16.777
Yeah?

11:16.844 --> 11:18.611
Any theories what they are?

11:18.678 --> 11:19.947
Could be some kind of code.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.815
Maybe we should get Charlie
on that.

11:21.882 --> 11:23.616
Yeah, all right.
I'll give him a call.

11:23.683 --> 11:26.286
Maybe we're looking
at this whole thing wrong.

11:26.353 --> 11:27.955
Most of the time with
disappearances like this, right,

11:28.021 --> 11:29.422
it always comes back
something personal.

11:29.489 --> 11:31.058
You know, you got a spouse,
ex-spouse,

11:31.124 --> 11:31.959
you got an angry boyfriend.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.326
Yeah, but
that's the thing.

11:33.393 --> 11:35.963
I mean, I checked. There's just,
there's no one in her life.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.030
There isn't anybody.

11:37.097 --> 11:40.533
This is the last time
anyone saw her, right?

11:40.600 --> 11:41.501
Where is she now?

11:41.568 --> 11:42.435
CHARLIE:
Hello?

11:42.502 --> 11:45.238
Look, I need you to take
a look at some numbers.

11:45.305 --> 11:47.140
Yeah, yeah, I'm on my way
down there right now.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.476
I just finished
my threat analysis.

11:49.542 --> 11:50.277
Yeah? Anything?

11:50.343 --> 11:51.779
No. No, nothing unusual.

11:51.845 --> 11:53.480
No one stands out.

11:53.546 --> 11:56.149
Really? Of all the people
she took down?

11:56.216 --> 11:57.484
Where are you?

11:58.418 --> 11:59.319
Charlie?

12:00.720 --> 12:04.792
Hey, can you hear me?
Are you there?

12:04.858 --> 12:06.626
(sighs)
Yeah, uh, you know, I'm sorry.

12:06.693 --> 12:08.561
Yeah. I'll be there in,

12:08.628 --> 12:10.831
like, 15 minutes, okay?

12:10.898 --> 12:12.766
All right.
-All righty, bye.

12:24.845 --> 12:26.246
(tires screeching)

12:33.486 --> 12:34.321
(gasps)

12:36.089 --> 12:37.090
No!

12:39.692 --> 12:40.928
Oh, God!

12:40.994 --> 12:43.296
(tires squeal)

13:08.555 --> 13:10.824
(horn beeping continuously)

13:30.878 --> 13:33.046
Hey, you all right?!
-I'm all right. It's all right.

13:33.113 --> 13:34.114
Well, you're gonna see
a doctor.

13:34.181 --> 13:35.382
I mean I don't
care what he says.

13:35.448 --> 13:36.950
Believe me, I'm not gonna refuse
any medical attention.

13:37.017 --> 13:38.485
This actually kind of smarts.

13:38.551 --> 13:40.888
Let me see.
-Hey, Charlie, you have any idea

13:40.954 --> 13:42.289
who might have tried to do this?

13:42.355 --> 13:44.892
I couldn't see them that well.

13:44.958 --> 13:46.326
Think about it
for a second.

13:46.393 --> 13:48.828
Anybody hanging out weird
on campus?

13:48.896 --> 13:49.796
Maybe at any
of your book signings?

13:49.863 --> 13:50.830
Did you flunk
any students

13:50.898 --> 13:52.565
or get in any fights with any
of them, anything like that?

13:52.632 --> 13:55.135
No, my students aren't trying
to kill me,

13:55.202 --> 13:59.206
although sometimes it seems
like they are.

13:59.272 --> 14:01.274
That wasn't the first time
I saw that truck.

14:01.341 --> 14:02.775
I think he followed me
last night.

14:02.842 --> 14:03.977
What are you talking about?

14:04.044 --> 14:05.112
Why didn't you tell me?

14:05.178 --> 14:08.748
Because you were already
so pissed off

14:08.815 --> 14:09.749
about my interview.

14:09.816 --> 14:10.918
Charlie...

14:10.984 --> 14:13.053
So I just didn't tell you.

14:13.120 --> 14:16.423
Come on, Charlie. You can come
to me with anything.

14:18.625 --> 14:20.527
Hey, guys, let me talk
to you for a minute.

14:20.593 --> 14:22.729
Yeah.

14:22.795 --> 14:25.098
Charlie gave a description
of the truck to the cops:

14:25.165 --> 14:26.233
silver pickup, fog lights,

14:26.299 --> 14:28.835
body work on the right front
fender and hood.

14:28.902 --> 14:29.636
All right, so?

14:29.702 --> 14:31.972
The same truck
was at the San Marino Mall

14:32.039 --> 14:33.006
the morning Bonnie Parks
disappeared.

14:33.073 --> 14:34.807
SINCLAIR:
Are you sure?

14:34.874 --> 14:36.309
I saw it on the video.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.445
It pulled out of the parking lot
only a couple minutes

14:38.511 --> 14:39.646
after she pulled in.

14:39.712 --> 14:40.847
Why are they going after
Charlie?

14:40.914 --> 14:42.149
They saw his interview.

14:42.215 --> 14:43.716
They knew he was
working the case.

14:43.783 --> 14:45.152
He's an easy target.
He doesn't shoot back.

14:45.218 --> 14:48.121
I want someone on him 24-7,
all right?

14:58.031 --> 15:00.100
CHARLIE: Come on, man.
Now this is ridiculous.

15:00.167 --> 15:01.768
There's not gonna be anybody
in my office.

15:01.834 --> 15:04.471
Charlie, you really
can't be too careful.

15:04.537 --> 15:05.172
You're wrong.

15:05.238 --> 15:06.239
This is proof
right here

15:06.306 --> 15:07.740
that you can be
too careful.

15:07.807 --> 15:09.176
Charlie, if anything happened
to you on my watch,

15:09.242 --> 15:10.410
Don would have my head.

15:10.477 --> 15:12.045
Okay?

15:12.112 --> 15:15.548
Let me do my job.
It's clear.

15:15.615 --> 15:17.350
Thank you.
Did you bring the numbers?

15:17.417 --> 15:19.086
AMITA:
What numbers?

15:19.152 --> 15:19.987
What is that?

15:20.053 --> 15:22.022
It's a list of numbers
we found

15:22.089 --> 15:23.056
in Bonnie Parks' office.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.193
Charlie, you're not still
working on this case?

15:26.259 --> 15:27.294
Why wouldn't I be?

15:27.360 --> 15:30.763
Do I really need
to explain this to you?

15:30.830 --> 15:33.733
What happened
shouldn't change anything.

15:33.800 --> 15:36.269
In fact, I'd rather just forget
it happened at all.

15:36.336 --> 15:38.905
Oh, that's a very
rational plan.

15:38.972 --> 15:41.608
I mean, it really works
for ostriches.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.045
Charlie, please, you
should not be working...

15:45.112 --> 15:46.413
I have to!

15:48.748 --> 15:50.017
Okay.

15:55.355 --> 15:58.058
Hey, if I could have ducked out
during the middle of that,

15:58.125 --> 15:59.926
I would have.

15:59.993 --> 16:03.563
Yeah... me, too.

16:05.532 --> 16:08.868
Her brother Clay was killed
by an IED three years ago.

16:08.935 --> 16:11.304
The last family she had.

16:14.074 --> 16:15.142
Everything all right?

16:17.010 --> 16:19.846
Man, you can't blame yourself.

16:19.912 --> 16:22.182
I mean, what if they'd hit him?

16:22.249 --> 16:23.583
They didn't.

16:26.086 --> 16:29.256
Well, we just gotta find out
who she was after, all right?

16:29.322 --> 16:31.991
Her editor said she didn't do
much work in her office,

16:32.059 --> 16:33.160
but it certainly seems

16:33.226 --> 16:34.727
like she didn't do
much here, either.

16:34.794 --> 16:37.964
All right, well,
let's get out of here.

16:38.031 --> 16:40.700
I'm thinking about sticking
around for a little bit.

16:40.767 --> 16:42.969
I kind of get this feeling
there's something more to her

16:43.036 --> 16:44.037
that everybody's missing.

16:44.104 --> 16:46.639
Maybe I can figure it out,
you know?

16:46.706 --> 16:47.440
All right, good.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.342
I'll see you back
at the office.

17:00.853 --> 17:02.822
*

17:02.889 --> 17:05.392
* I'm coming up only *

17:05.458 --> 17:09.629
* To hold you under

17:09.696 --> 17:11.731
You about ready?

17:11.798 --> 17:13.733
Would you check focus?

17:13.800 --> 17:16.869
'Cause the last one
was a little soft to me.

17:16.936 --> 17:19.639
* To show you wrong

17:23.810 --> 17:30.817
* And to know you
is hardly wonder *

17:34.087 --> 17:35.322
It was November.

17:35.388 --> 17:38.891
Judge Booth was still presiding
over the murder trial

17:38.958 --> 17:41.094
when he lured the defendant's
wife Dennis to this...

17:41.161 --> 17:42.962
(laughing)

17:43.029 --> 17:46.633
I'm sorry. It was supposed
to be "Denise," not "Dennis."

17:46.699 --> 17:49.336
I think we should do that
over again. What do you think?

17:54.040 --> 17:57.510
* Ooh...

18:04.384 --> 18:05.385
Come on. Come on.

18:05.452 --> 18:06.819
This is crazy
having a bodyguard.

18:06.886 --> 18:08.721
I mean, do you really have
to lurk like that?

18:08.788 --> 18:11.191
I have a better vantage point
from back here.

18:11.258 --> 18:12.792
I can see more.
More what?

18:12.859 --> 18:13.926
Come on.

18:13.993 --> 18:15.962
Charlie, please.

18:16.028 --> 18:19.399
Charlie, can we get
where we're going, please?

18:19.466 --> 18:20.667
Charlie, I just heard.

18:20.733 --> 18:21.868
You should have called me
last night.

18:21.934 --> 18:24.771
It's not that big a deal,
all right? I'm fine.

18:24.837 --> 18:27.307
Amita's of a contrary opinion.
-She came to see me.

18:27.374 --> 18:28.941
She wants me
to dissuade you

18:29.008 --> 18:29.976
from staying
on this case.

18:30.042 --> 18:30.877
I got to say

18:30.943 --> 18:32.279
I tend to agree with her.

18:32.345 --> 18:33.780
Hey, Eppes,
check it out.

18:33.846 --> 18:35.548
The very latest
in home photovoltaics.

18:35.615 --> 18:36.616
You thinking
of going solar here?

18:36.683 --> 18:39.219
Can we take this
inside the office maybe?

18:39.286 --> 18:40.220
Not out here.
-Agent Sinclair,

18:40.287 --> 18:41.621
what are you
doing over there?

18:41.688 --> 18:42.855
He's getting a
better vantage point.

18:42.922 --> 18:44.657
Somebody tried to kill Charlie
last night.

18:44.724 --> 18:46.226
Can we not?

18:46.293 --> 18:48.761
No offense, but if you got
to get a FBI bodyguard,

18:48.828 --> 18:51.298
why not get that hot one
we worked with-- Agent Reeves?

18:51.364 --> 18:52.799
Pretty sure
she was digging me.

18:52.865 --> 18:55.602
You know, actually, Ray,
Agent Reeves-- or Megan--

18:55.668 --> 18:57.870
and I-- we're,
we're kind of involved.

18:57.937 --> 18:59.672
(laughs)

18:59.739 --> 19:01.107
You serious?

19:01.174 --> 19:02.409
Yeah, I am.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.611
And a little
less incredulity

19:04.677 --> 19:06.179
on your part
would be appreciated.

19:06.246 --> 19:09.582
No, Larry, sorry. It's just
how often do women like that

19:09.649 --> 19:11.851
get involved with guys like us?

19:11.918 --> 19:12.919
Nice going.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.187
Okay, well, thank you.

19:14.254 --> 19:15.855
(loud crash)

19:21.027 --> 19:22.161
You okay?

19:23.330 --> 19:25.064
I'm fine.

19:25.131 --> 19:26.098
And I'm really sick

19:26.165 --> 19:29.569
of having to tell
everybody that.

19:39.979 --> 19:41.248
Hey.

19:41.314 --> 19:42.148
Hey, Donnie.

19:42.215 --> 19:43.550
Didn't expect
to see you.

19:43.616 --> 19:44.984
Everything all right
with Charlie?

19:45.051 --> 19:47.454
Yeah, David's with him.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.422
You know, Dad...
I'm kind of thinking

19:49.489 --> 19:51.658
that maybe he shouldn't work
for me anymore.

19:51.724 --> 19:54.294
Well, I can't say
that wouldn't be safer.

19:54.361 --> 19:55.928
No, it's not just that. It's...

19:55.995 --> 19:57.330
What is it?

19:57.397 --> 20:00.567
You and Mom-- you
sacrificed so much

20:00.633 --> 20:03.603
for him to do something great,
you know.

20:03.670 --> 20:05.772
And what, you think he's
supposed to be doing something

20:05.838 --> 20:06.973
better than what you do?

20:07.039 --> 20:09.242
Yeah.

20:09.309 --> 20:12.445
You know, uh...
none of us can tell

20:12.512 --> 20:14.414
where Charlie's path
to greatness might take him.

20:14.481 --> 20:16.749
I mean, even the FBI
might be part of it.

20:17.884 --> 20:19.452
Besides, he likes
working with you.

20:19.519 --> 20:20.987
I don't think
you could stop him.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.290
I don't know...

20:23.356 --> 20:25.392
Oh, and Donnie...

20:25.458 --> 20:27.327
we all made those sacrifices
for Charlie,

20:27.394 --> 20:28.761
especially you.

20:35.468 --> 20:37.537
(clattering)

20:37.604 --> 20:39.005
(beep)

21:02.529 --> 21:03.696
(phone dialing)

21:03.763 --> 21:04.897
(line ringing)

21:04.964 --> 21:05.965
DON:
Eppes.

21:06.032 --> 21:08.535
Hey, Don, she gets
two power bills delivered here.

21:08.601 --> 21:10.803
One's for an address down
in the warehouse district.

21:10.870 --> 21:12.939
Maybe that's where
she does her work.

21:13.005 --> 21:15.141
I need the address.
I'm coming from the house.

21:15.207 --> 21:17.410
It's 819 Third Street, #104.

21:25.117 --> 21:28.220
(men conversing indistinctly)

21:28.287 --> 21:29.922
MAN:
Guys, let's get out of here.

21:34.060 --> 21:34.994
FBI! Don't move!

21:36.463 --> 21:37.597
Man, it's cool.

21:44.170 --> 21:46.005
(siren blaring)

21:55.247 --> 21:57.684
You all right?
-Yeah.

22:04.591 --> 22:07.093
Yeah, 819 East Third.

22:07.159 --> 22:09.228
That was the truck
that Charlie described, right?

22:09.295 --> 22:10.096
Yeah.

22:10.162 --> 22:13.032
You know what,
I'm pretty sure I wounded

22:13.099 --> 22:14.501
a second one of those guys.

22:14.567 --> 22:16.002
You all right? You good?

22:16.068 --> 22:18.838
Yeah, probably more lucky
than good, but... I'm fine.

22:18.905 --> 22:20.072
Those guys were
clearing out

22:20.139 --> 22:21.408
Bonnie's place.

22:22.575 --> 22:24.110
Take a look at this.

22:24.176 --> 22:25.445
It's more of those lists

22:25.512 --> 22:27.747
of numbers like we found
in her office.

22:27.814 --> 22:30.417
Got stuff on this guy
named Richard Taylor.

22:30.483 --> 22:31.784
Richard Taylor?

22:31.851 --> 22:33.152
He's a big
real estate developer.

22:33.219 --> 22:34.654
I wonder if that's who

22:34.721 --> 22:35.888
she was investigating.

22:35.955 --> 22:36.889
Wait a minute.

22:36.956 --> 22:39.325
This guy was one of the guys
who just took off in the truck.

22:39.392 --> 22:40.326
You sure?

22:40.393 --> 22:41.794
Yeah, I'm positive.

22:43.430 --> 22:45.465
This is getting closer,
but we still have

22:45.532 --> 22:46.999
to make better use
of the plaza space here.

22:47.066 --> 22:48.901
The traffic flow
along the boulevard...

22:48.968 --> 22:49.769
Taylor?

22:49.836 --> 22:51.638
You or any
of your people

22:51.704 --> 22:52.839
ever come near my family again,

22:52.905 --> 22:54.441
I'm going to tear you apart.
You hear me?

22:54.507 --> 22:55.675
Yeah, I don't know you.

22:56.543 --> 22:57.844
That's you.

22:57.910 --> 23:00.012
This guy tried
to kill my brother last night.

23:00.079 --> 23:03.249
What, some guys walks up
to me on the street,

23:03.315 --> 23:04.083
you take a picture,

23:04.150 --> 23:05.452
that's supposed to be proof
of something?

23:05.518 --> 23:07.420
Take it as a warning, pal.

23:07.487 --> 23:08.421
Let me tell you something.

23:08.488 --> 23:10.256
I started in
this business

23:10.322 --> 23:11.758
swinging a hammer when I was 15.

23:11.824 --> 23:13.125
I got to deal with Mafia,

23:13.192 --> 23:15.428
unions, extortion scams.

23:15.495 --> 23:17.697
You don't scare me.

23:17.764 --> 23:21.468
Next time you see me it's going
to be to lock your ass up.

23:32.044 --> 23:34.313
Is that one of the guys
who came after me?

23:34.380 --> 23:36.816
Yeah. You
recognize him?

23:36.883 --> 23:38.985
I couldn't
really see

23:39.051 --> 23:41.087
anything when it was happening.
I'm sorry.

23:41.153 --> 23:43.255
You don't have anything
to feel sorry about, okay?

23:43.322 --> 23:45.224
It's just
a little weird,

23:45.291 --> 23:47.927
you know, he's dead now.

23:47.994 --> 23:51.998
Charlie, look, that guy's dead
because he shot at me.

23:52.064 --> 23:54.133
I had no choice
but to shoot back.

24:02.041 --> 24:03.943
A-DIC's been
looking for you.

24:04.010 --> 24:07.580
I just spent 20 minutes
getting chewed out by him.

24:07.647 --> 24:09.048
That wasn't a smart move, Don--

24:09.115 --> 24:09.982
threatening Taylor.

24:10.049 --> 24:12.284
Yeah, I know that, David.
Thank you very much.

24:12.351 --> 24:14.120
All right.

24:14.186 --> 24:17.223
Well, we put some information
together on Taylor, so...

24:17.289 --> 24:19.191
All right.

24:19.258 --> 24:20.392
COLBY: His firm's working on

24:20.459 --> 24:21.460
this massive redevelopment
project.

24:21.528 --> 24:23.029
I got restaurants,
movie theaters,

24:23.095 --> 24:23.863
condos, the whole bit.

24:23.930 --> 24:24.931
DON:
Yeah, yeah, I saw it.

24:24.997 --> 24:25.932
It's this model
right here.

24:25.998 --> 24:27.366
And to the city,
this thing makes Taylor

24:27.433 --> 24:29.368
look like a big hero--
bringing a revenue center

24:29.435 --> 24:30.803
to a formerly
blighted area.

24:30.870 --> 24:32.438
Right. The thing is,
Bonnie Parks

24:32.505 --> 24:34.106
doesn't see him that way.

24:34.173 --> 24:35.542
She's been talking
with mostly poor local residents

24:35.608 --> 24:39.178
who've all been forced out to
make room for the development,

24:39.245 --> 24:40.780
and they've been terrorized
by Taylor's thugs.

24:40.847 --> 24:42.882
Forced them to sell.

24:42.949 --> 24:43.950
Here's the thing:
his project's not

24:44.016 --> 24:45.752
free and clear yet.
He's still waiting

24:45.818 --> 24:47.787
on a big vote
from the zoning commission.

24:47.854 --> 24:49.789
Can't afford any organized
opposition to his project.

24:49.856 --> 24:52.124
Right. And especially
not bad press.

24:52.191 --> 24:52.992
I mean, if Bonnie

24:53.059 --> 24:54.026
does the exposГ©

24:54.093 --> 24:55.394
and shows what Taylor's
been up to...

24:55.461 --> 24:56.395
It gets voted down

24:56.462 --> 24:57.630
and he loses the beaucoup bucks.

24:57.697 --> 24:58.731
DAVID: And there's
your motive.

24:58.798 --> 25:00.767
The problem is if Bonnie had

25:00.833 --> 25:01.968
any kind of proof,
you know... it's not here.

25:02.034 --> 25:04.203
We're working this guy, right?

25:04.270 --> 25:06.806
Yeah, we still have
the number streams, too.

25:06.873 --> 25:07.807
Charlie, have you had

25:07.874 --> 25:09.041
any luck with those?

25:11.477 --> 25:16.783
I, uh...
I'm still working on it.

25:16.849 --> 25:18.751
Okay, well, sooner
would be better than later

25:18.818 --> 25:20.820
if she's still out there
somewhere.

25:28.628 --> 25:30.262
What about a downturn
analysis approach?

25:30.329 --> 25:33.165
Downturn analysis would require
that I know what I'm analyzing,

25:33.232 --> 25:34.834
and I don't,
so that's the problem.

25:34.901 --> 25:36.903
But we know it's got
to have something to do

25:36.969 --> 25:38.104
with Taylor's development,
right?

25:38.170 --> 25:39.171
So what if it's

25:39.238 --> 25:40.907
a list of investors

25:40.973 --> 25:42.108
or, I don't know...

25:42.174 --> 25:43.843
Okay, okay, here's
another idea.

25:43.910 --> 25:45.645
Admittedly, it's tangential,
but seeing as how

25:45.712 --> 25:47.313
it would appear
you're at an impasse...

25:47.379 --> 25:49.281
I'm not at an impasse.

25:49.348 --> 25:50.783
Would...

25:50.850 --> 25:53.285
will you just give me
a moment to think, please?

25:53.352 --> 25:55.622
Whoa, how's it coming?

25:55.688 --> 25:57.456
Well, we haven't cracked it yet,
if that's what you mean.

25:57.523 --> 25:59.992
It would appear
Charles' patience

26:00.059 --> 26:00.927
is taxed

26:00.993 --> 26:01.861
as well as
his aptitude.

26:01.928 --> 26:02.995
I'm right here, Lawrence.

26:03.062 --> 26:04.831
Is there anything
I can do to help?

26:04.897 --> 26:06.866
Sure you want to be
involved in this?

26:06.933 --> 26:09.836
If my help will make it
go away any faster, yes.

26:09.902 --> 26:11.537
Look, she wouldn't have made
this list of numbers

26:11.604 --> 26:12.939
if they weren't important.

26:13.005 --> 26:14.540
I mean, she's too deliberate
and focused for that.

26:14.607 --> 26:17.944
You sound like you know her.

26:18.010 --> 26:20.379
Hey, the Eppes' garage has
become a Cal Sci faculty club.

26:20.446 --> 26:21.881
Look what I got.

26:21.948 --> 26:24.316
Third gen electric solar sheet
incorporating

26:24.383 --> 26:26.218
semiconductor quantum dots
and nanoparticles.

26:26.285 --> 26:28.220
Thought I'd throw my sales pitch
at your dad.

26:28.287 --> 26:29.255
He's in the kitchen.

26:29.321 --> 26:30.322
I'll go with you.

26:38.064 --> 26:40.833
Don, I'm running down Colby's
dead guy, Randall Platt.

26:40.900 --> 26:42.301
Dude had more than
a dozen arrests, right?

26:42.368 --> 26:45.672
Half the time his bail was
posted by his brother-in-law

26:45.738 --> 26:46.873
Sonny Leyva.

26:46.939 --> 26:48.107
Guess what Sonny drives.

26:48.174 --> 26:49.909
A silver pickup?

26:49.976 --> 26:51.443
Yeah, I had LAPD do a roll
by his apartment.

26:51.510 --> 26:52.879
Truck's right
out front.

26:52.945 --> 26:55.114
You call SWAT?
-Already suiting up.

26:59.351 --> 27:00.419
David?

27:00.486 --> 27:01.420
We're good to go.

27:01.487 --> 27:03.189
All right, here we go.

27:07.226 --> 27:08.094
FBI! Don't move!

27:09.762 --> 27:11.263
Get down! Turn around!
On your knees!

27:11.330 --> 27:12.231
On your knees!

27:12.298 --> 27:13.132
Cuff him.

27:13.199 --> 27:14.100
Don't move!

27:15.167 --> 27:16.669
That's the guy
Colby shot.

27:17.970 --> 27:18.905
Oh, he's dead.

27:18.971 --> 27:20.406
They're clear in there.

27:23.275 --> 27:24.844
You've got loads
of south-facing roof,

27:24.911 --> 27:27.513
which is the optimal angle
for gathering sunlight.

27:27.579 --> 27:28.781
Sunlight?

27:28.848 --> 27:30.750
Most of the roof
is shaded by trees.

27:30.817 --> 27:33.019
So we'll trim the trees
a little. It's not a big deal.

27:33.085 --> 27:35.988
And you've got space
for at least 50 panels,

27:36.055 --> 27:37.523
which is enough probably
to generate

27:37.589 --> 27:38.991
50 kilowatt-hours

27:39.058 --> 27:40.727
on a good sunny Pasadena day.

27:40.793 --> 27:42.428
Yeah, but that's more
than we use.

27:42.494 --> 27:44.964
So how sweet would it be
to see the electric meter

27:45.031 --> 27:46.598
spinning backwards?

27:46.665 --> 27:47.967
Hey, guys, I'm all for going
green, saving the planet,

27:48.034 --> 27:49.468
and all that, but Charlie and I
got some work to do.

27:49.535 --> 27:50.469
I can't.

27:50.536 --> 27:53.139
I can't. You saw I tried.

27:53.205 --> 27:54.673
So let's go on back there
and let's try again...

27:54.741 --> 27:55.808
Colby, it won't do any good!

27:55.875 --> 27:57.744
Charlie, there's a woman
out there-- Bonnie,

27:57.810 --> 28:00.112
she may or may not be
alive, but the fact is,

28:00.179 --> 28:01.347
we got to keep working on this.

28:01.413 --> 28:02.882
Yeah, and you don't think
I know that, right?

28:02.949 --> 28:04.316
You don't think
I'm aware of the stakes!

28:04.383 --> 28:05.451
I can't do it.

28:05.517 --> 28:06.786
Colby, I...

28:06.853 --> 28:08.587
My mind won't think. I...

28:08.654 --> 28:10.656
I look
at my boards

28:10.723 --> 28:12.224
and it's all out of focus.

28:12.291 --> 28:13.893
I can't do it.
I can't.

28:13.960 --> 28:16.162
So just stop asking me,
all right?

28:16.228 --> 28:17.163
Please.

28:23.035 --> 28:25.037
DAVID: Your silence isn't going
to help you, Sonny.

28:25.104 --> 28:27.073
It's only going to get you in

28:27.139 --> 28:28.474
deeper, you know
that, right?

28:28.540 --> 28:29.809
DON:
See, that's you

28:29.876 --> 28:31.043
leaving the San Marino Mall
eight minutes

28:31.110 --> 28:32.344
after Bonnie Parks pulled in.

28:32.411 --> 28:33.445
You and your friends

28:33.512 --> 28:35.147
had her stuffed down
on the floor, didn't you?

28:35.214 --> 28:36.749
Sonny, let me
tell you something.

28:36.816 --> 28:38.017
It's not you I'm after,
you hear me?

28:38.084 --> 28:39.085
It's Taylor I want.

28:39.151 --> 28:41.120
How long do you think
it's going to take

28:41.187 --> 28:42.588
for us to put this whole thing
together?

28:42.654 --> 28:44.690
Do yourself a favor, man.
Earn yourself some points.

28:44.757 --> 28:45.691
It might help you

28:45.758 --> 28:46.893
avoid the death penalty.

28:46.959 --> 28:48.027
Death penalty?

28:48.094 --> 28:49.495
Oh, man, I didn't kill nobody.

28:50.763 --> 28:52.131
You saying Bonnie Parks
is still alive?

28:52.198 --> 28:55.267
Yeah, last time I checked.

28:55.334 --> 28:56.335
Wait a minute.

28:56.402 --> 28:58.570
So Richard Taylor
only needed her out of the way

28:58.637 --> 29:00.840
until he got that vote
from the zoning commission.

29:00.907 --> 29:01.974
That's right,
isn't it?

29:02.041 --> 29:04.110
He asked you guys
to stash her away

29:04.176 --> 29:05.544
somewhere for a few weeks.

29:05.611 --> 29:06.545
Where is she?

29:06.612 --> 29:07.746
She's safe.

29:08.447 --> 29:09.982
She's safe, man.

29:10.049 --> 29:12.819
But without me,
she ain't got no food, right?

29:12.885 --> 29:14.120
She ain't got no water, man.

29:14.186 --> 29:16.055
Now I can't tell you
how much longer

29:16.122 --> 29:17.790
she going to last
like that.

29:17.857 --> 29:20.059
Uh-huh, so what are you after?
-I walk.

29:20.126 --> 29:22.061
Free and clear.
You give me that...

29:22.128 --> 29:23.295
I'll tell you where she is.

29:23.362 --> 29:24.196
No way.
It's not going to happen.

29:24.263 --> 29:27.266
Then the body's on you, man--
not on me.

29:34.941 --> 29:36.175
You've either got a lot of guts

29:36.242 --> 29:38.644
or very little brains
coming back here.

29:38.710 --> 29:40.446
What I got is Sonny Leyva.

29:40.512 --> 29:42.681
Last time you said if you came
back, you'd be locking me up.

29:42.748 --> 29:44.116
So where are the cuffs?

29:44.183 --> 29:46.318
No, I just thought it'd be
more fun to watch you sweat.

29:46.385 --> 29:48.054
'Cause you know
when I find Bonnie

29:48.120 --> 29:49.221
she's gonna finger Sonny.

29:49.288 --> 29:51.057
And there's no way
that Sonny's gonna be doing

29:51.123 --> 29:52.458
a kidnapping rap on his own.

29:52.524 --> 29:53.725
Sorry I'm not sweating.

29:53.792 --> 29:54.861
Sure you are.

29:54.927 --> 29:56.896
You know Sonny's
gonna roll on you.

29:56.963 --> 29:59.198
For that, you need Bonnie alive.

29:59.265 --> 30:04.370
And I just don't think
you're gonna find her in time.

30:11.043 --> 30:12.378
What are we doing here?

30:16.148 --> 30:18.750
When I was being held on that
freighter and they had me

30:18.817 --> 30:21.053
handcuffed and Lancer was
sticking me with needles,

30:21.120 --> 30:24.223
there's one thing
that kept me going.

30:24.290 --> 30:27.193
That was knowing that
my team was coming for me.

30:27.259 --> 30:28.760
No matter how screwed up
things had gotten,

30:28.827 --> 30:31.898
that you and David and Megan
and Don were working hard

30:31.964 --> 30:34.733
and you were going to come
through that door.

30:34.800 --> 30:37.003
The thing is, Bonnie Parks,
she doesn't have a team.

30:37.069 --> 30:38.204
She's got nobody.

30:38.270 --> 30:40.472
And she's locked up, handcuffed,
in the dark,

30:40.539 --> 30:41.607
I don't know what.

30:41.673 --> 30:42.808
But what I do know

30:42.875 --> 30:45.344
is that I want to be the one
who comes through that door

30:45.411 --> 30:47.579
for her.
-I want to help you.

30:47.646 --> 30:50.216
But I cannot control
what's going on in my head.

30:50.282 --> 30:52.151
You don't understand.

30:52.218 --> 30:54.286
That's the thing, Charlie.
I do understand.

30:54.353 --> 30:57.056
'Cause I went through
this exact same thing

30:57.123 --> 30:59.291
when I first saw combat
in Afghanistan.

30:59.358 --> 31:02.094
You have to talk
about the attack--

31:02.161 --> 31:03.862
every detail, every memory,

31:03.930 --> 31:06.132
every thought that went through
your head when it was happening.

31:06.198 --> 31:08.067
You can't keep it
all locked

31:08.134 --> 31:10.236
inside of your head.
You can't just keep going around

31:10.302 --> 31:11.337
telling everybody
you're fine.

31:11.403 --> 31:13.705
Well, obviously, I'm not fine.

31:13.772 --> 31:17.309
That's why you got to
do something about it.

31:19.545 --> 31:22.381
It doesn't matter
how scared you were.

31:22.448 --> 31:25.184
Doesn't matter if you
wet your pants, man.

31:25.251 --> 31:28.020
There's nobody out here
who's gonna hear it.

31:32.824 --> 31:36.262
I was just... driving.

31:36.328 --> 31:38.797
I'd just hung up
the phone with Don.

31:38.864 --> 31:41.567
I saw some taillights up ahead.

31:41.633 --> 31:43.002
It was only out of
the corner of my eye

31:43.069 --> 31:44.570
that I realized it was...

31:44.636 --> 31:45.471
My heart started racing.

31:45.537 --> 31:47.573
I was scared.

31:51.343 --> 31:52.945
*

32:15.301 --> 32:17.169
*

32:30.516 --> 32:31.383
Real estate.

32:31.450 --> 32:34.053
The numbers describe
individual properties.

32:34.120 --> 32:37.389
Yeah, ten-digit
property ID numbers,

32:37.456 --> 32:38.390
square footage,
track numbers,

32:38.457 --> 32:40.659
assessed values,
only they're all obscured.

32:40.726 --> 32:42.461
Yeah, Bonnie Parks
had somebody inside

32:42.528 --> 32:44.063
the county assessor's office
feeding her information.

32:44.130 --> 32:46.132
All this information
is in the public record.

32:46.198 --> 32:47.666
Why would she bother to
disguise it with a code?

32:47.733 --> 32:50.236
Well, we think Bonnie realized
there was something

32:50.302 --> 32:51.703
wrong with the numbers,
but she didn't know what it was.

32:51.770 --> 32:53.472
Yeah, here's the thing
about property values:

32:53.539 --> 32:55.907
they're not independent
from one house to the next.

32:55.974 --> 32:57.409
Right, the value
of your house

32:57.476 --> 32:59.445
is related to what your
neighbor can get for his.

32:59.511 --> 33:01.113
Right, in fact,
property values behave

33:01.180 --> 33:02.414
has similarly to, let's say,

33:02.481 --> 33:05.151
a rope of buoys
strung across a pool.

33:05.217 --> 33:07.486
If you apply force
to a particular buoy

33:07.553 --> 33:08.854
pulling it down
toward the bottom,

33:08.920 --> 33:13.192
that buoy will in turn exert a
force on its neighboring buoys,

33:13.259 --> 33:14.493
pulling them down as well.

33:14.560 --> 33:16.428
Now at the same time,
those neighboring buoys

33:16.495 --> 33:18.430
will help hold up
the weighted buoy.

33:18.497 --> 33:19.965
It's an interconnected system.

33:20.032 --> 33:21.400
Each buoy's function,

33:21.467 --> 33:22.834
each property's value,

33:22.901 --> 33:24.070
they're only
semi-autonomous.

33:24.136 --> 33:26.105
You said she found something
wrong with the numbers, right?

33:26.172 --> 33:27.139
Well, Richard Taylor

33:27.206 --> 33:29.341
found a way to underassess
the home prices.

33:29.408 --> 33:31.977
He was able to
artificially undervalue

33:32.044 --> 33:33.879
all the properties in the area
that he wanted to develop.

33:33.945 --> 33:35.614
Essentially,
he was able to submerge

33:35.681 --> 33:38.117
the entire line of buoys.
-That would save him

33:38.184 --> 33:39.951
millions as he bought back
those properties.

33:40.018 --> 33:42.188
Hundreds of millions,
potentially.

33:42.254 --> 33:45.191
Okay, now if Bonnie Parks
was gonna expose him,

33:45.257 --> 33:46.858
that'd be more than
just bad press, right?

33:46.925 --> 33:48.994
I mean, we're talking
about major real estate fraud.

33:49.061 --> 33:51.597
Good job, Charlie,
man, thanks.

33:55.567 --> 33:58.570
How much longer
do you think she has?

33:58.637 --> 33:59.438
No way to know.

33:59.505 --> 34:00.572
All right,

34:00.639 --> 34:03.175
Sonny and his thugs,
they were hired

34:03.242 --> 34:05.043
to stash Bonnie somewhere,
right?

34:05.111 --> 34:06.378
Where would they put her?

34:06.445 --> 34:08.414
Well, I mean, Taylor's company
owns 46 properties.

34:08.480 --> 34:10.249
There's no way they'd stash her
on one of those.

34:10.316 --> 34:11.483
It's too risky.

34:11.550 --> 34:13.852
Too much chance
she'd be heard or seen.

34:13.919 --> 34:15.354
Hold on.

34:15.421 --> 34:17.989
Bonnie's list
has 49 properties.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.225
You just said 46.

34:19.291 --> 34:20.826
Yeah, you're right.

34:20.892 --> 34:22.961
I mean, he owns three other ones
that we excluded from the list

34:23.028 --> 34:24.530
'cause they weren't part
of the appraisal scam.

34:24.596 --> 34:26.365
All right,
where are they?

34:26.432 --> 34:27.733
Well, they're rural tracts.

34:27.799 --> 34:29.268
That's isolated, man.

34:29.335 --> 34:31.403
That's a good place to
hide somebody, right?

34:31.470 --> 34:33.205
Yeah, this one's just
raw acreage, though.

34:33.272 --> 34:35.073
There's nowhere to put her.

34:35.141 --> 34:37.243
(typing, computer trills)

34:39.945 --> 34:40.946
Yep, that one, too.

34:41.012 --> 34:42.114
Come on.

34:42.181 --> 34:44.116
(computer trilling)

34:45.083 --> 34:46.285
Wait a minute.
There we go.

34:46.352 --> 34:48.420
There's an old house.

34:49.054 --> 34:51.590
*

34:57.563 --> 35:00.866
* Really too late to call

35:00.932 --> 35:04.136
* So we wait for

35:04.203 --> 35:05.237
Anything?

35:05.304 --> 35:06.305
Anyone?
Nothing.

35:06.372 --> 35:07.873
She's not here.

35:07.939 --> 35:09.808
(grunts loudly)

35:09.875 --> 35:11.042
It's all right, man.
We're gonna find her, okay?

35:11.109 --> 35:12.043
It's just not this one.

35:12.110 --> 35:13.479
Where, David?
This was it.

35:16.215 --> 35:20.619
* To know me as hardly golden

35:20.686 --> 35:22.488
Guys, wait.
Hang on a second.

35:22.554 --> 35:23.889
Guys, wait a minute.
Stop moving.

35:26.658 --> 35:27.893
(distant clank)

35:27.959 --> 35:30.396
It's coming from below us,
in the basement.

35:35.801 --> 35:42.741
* And every occasion,
I'll be ready for the funeral *

35:42.808 --> 35:45.344
Shh!

35:45.411 --> 35:47.313
Do you hear that?
Back there.

35:47.379 --> 35:50.749
* Every occasion once more

35:50.816 --> 35:52.451
(muffled screaming)

35:52.518 --> 35:54.453
* Is called the funeral

35:54.520 --> 35:55.821
(muffled screaming continues)

35:59.391 --> 36:02.661
Bonnie!
My name is Colby, FBI.

36:02.728 --> 36:03.762
(coughs)

36:03.829 --> 36:05.497
You okay?

36:05.564 --> 36:06.998
I wasn't sure you'd hear me.

36:07.065 --> 36:08.500
Yeah, we heard you.

36:09.768 --> 36:11.903
Let me get that.

36:13.004 --> 36:15.474
Think you can stand up?

36:15.541 --> 36:16.775
Let me give you a hand.
No.

36:18.844 --> 36:19.845
I can make it.

36:21.747 --> 36:23.215
Don't touch me.

36:24.816 --> 36:31.457
* I'm coming up only
to show you down for it *

36:31.523 --> 36:32.591
(sighs)

36:32.658 --> 36:35.026
I'm sure what she meant
to say was "thanks."

36:35.093 --> 36:40.899
* I'm coming up only
to show you wrong. *

36:43.902 --> 36:46.204
Phase one and phase two
are ready to go.

36:46.272 --> 36:47.839
We're waiting...

36:47.906 --> 36:48.874
Oh come on, Eppes.

36:48.940 --> 36:50.742
I don't have time for you.
Give it a rest already.

36:50.809 --> 36:52.311
This is a warrant
for your arrest.

36:55.213 --> 36:56.615
Here we go.

36:56.682 --> 36:57.549
We found Bonnie.

36:57.616 --> 36:59.385
(handcuffs tightening)
And Sonny did roll,

36:59.451 --> 37:01.587
just like I promised
you he would.

37:01.653 --> 37:03.121
You're not sweating there,
are you?

37:03.188 --> 37:04.256
This is crap.

37:04.323 --> 37:05.524
It's nothing
but a personal vendetta.

37:05.591 --> 37:06.792
Yeah, you got that right.

37:06.858 --> 37:08.226
Let's go.

37:12.130 --> 37:13.832
GALUSKI: Structurally,
you're in great shape.

37:13.899 --> 37:15.267
These panels weigh
next to nothing.

37:15.334 --> 37:16.668
We'd barely
have to modify

37:16.735 --> 37:17.803
the roof at all.

37:17.869 --> 37:18.804
Modify the roof?

37:18.870 --> 37:21.507
First, we're talking
about trimming a few trees.

37:21.573 --> 37:22.541
Now we're going
to modify the roof.

37:22.608 --> 37:25.176
It's just a little
reinforcement.

37:25.243 --> 37:26.512
These solar panels
are lightweight.

37:26.578 --> 37:28.414
It seems simple enough.
-ALAN: I still don't see

37:28.480 --> 37:30.616
why Charlie feels the need
to change everything.

37:30.682 --> 37:31.950
Alan, it's
just the roof.

37:32.017 --> 37:33.084
"Just the roof," huh?

37:33.151 --> 37:34.520
Yeah, that's the roof

37:34.586 --> 37:37.589
that Donnie and I put up
after their mother died.

37:37.656 --> 37:39.458
What happens when we have
to tear apart the walls

37:39.525 --> 37:41.460
to put in that
new heating system?

37:41.527 --> 37:43.595
Look, I-I didn't realize that...

37:43.662 --> 37:46.965
It's not just walls
and roof shingles to me.

37:47.032 --> 37:48.600
Yeah, I really don't think
Charlie's trying

37:48.667 --> 37:50.502
to destroy your memories here.

37:50.569 --> 37:52.838
I mean, if anything,
he's... preserving them.

37:52.904 --> 37:55.374
He's bringing the
house up to date.

37:55.441 --> 37:56.608
You know, he's making it

37:56.675 --> 37:58.510
functional for another
hundred years.

37:58.577 --> 38:01.279
GALUSKI: Besides, the whole
spirit of Craftsman

38:01.347 --> 38:02.714
architecture was
a belief that beauty

38:02.781 --> 38:04.583
and practicality were the same.

38:04.650 --> 38:06.685
If this technology were
available back in 1909,

38:06.752 --> 38:09.455
I bet the original builders
would've used it.

38:10.789 --> 38:12.758
Well...

38:12.824 --> 38:15.226
I suppose I did sell him
the house,

38:15.293 --> 38:17.095
so it's his now.
Yeah.

38:17.162 --> 38:20.399
Let Charlie hang up
a few of his own shingles.

38:28.407 --> 38:30.308
Whoa, what are you doing?
You need a hand?

38:30.376 --> 38:31.977
Yeah. Hey.
-Where are you going with this?

38:32.043 --> 38:32.811
Right behind you.

38:32.878 --> 38:34.480
Right just back there.
-What, just down?

38:34.546 --> 38:36.682
All right.
Okay.

38:38.249 --> 38:39.618
So we got Taylor sealed up

38:39.685 --> 38:41.286
pretty darn tight.
We sent it over

38:41.353 --> 38:42.388
to the US Attorney.
-Good.

38:42.454 --> 38:44.656
Then it's safe
for me to drive again.

38:46.558 --> 38:48.394
Look... I've kind of been
thinking about

38:48.460 --> 38:50.295
you working for us.

38:50.362 --> 38:51.763
This one got a little scary.

38:51.830 --> 38:54.299
Yeah, exactly.

38:54.366 --> 38:55.734
I mean, I don't
know if we

38:55.801 --> 38:57.836
would've found her in time
without you, but...

38:57.903 --> 39:00.338
Well, you know
I'm always glad to help.

39:00.406 --> 39:02.974
The thing is, do
you think that...

39:03.041 --> 39:04.910
you know, I've been
holding you back?

39:04.976 --> 39:06.478
From what?

39:06.545 --> 39:10.516
Just... you know,
doing something better.

39:11.817 --> 39:13.351
No.

39:13.419 --> 39:15.387
'Cause if you ever do,
you've got to tell me.

39:15.454 --> 39:16.755
You've got to promise me
you'll tell me.

39:16.822 --> 39:19.991
Sure. Deal.

39:20.058 --> 39:22.861
Good.

39:22.928 --> 39:24.229
(remote clicks)
All right, let's see now.

39:24.295 --> 39:26.164
Come on.

39:26.231 --> 39:27.332
There it is.

39:27.399 --> 39:29.401
Yeah, works like a charm.

39:29.468 --> 39:30.502
Good job.

39:30.569 --> 39:32.738
