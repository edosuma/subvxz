<i>Previously on
"Masters of Sex"...</i>

00:07.632 --> 00:08.818
Libby.

00:08.818 --> 00:11.794
- Is this baby gone?
- I'm so sorry.

00:14.284 --> 00:16.819
Libby, we have a family.

00:16.910 --> 00:19.884
Just the two of us...
That's enough for me.

00:21.250 --> 00:24.185
- The study is back.
- Heck yes.

00:27.323 --> 00:29.958
Why won't my dick work?!

00:29.992 --> 00:33.208
The problem's not in your
pants, Austin, it's in your head.

00:33.209 --> 00:34.975
I fuck men

00:35.025 --> 00:38.027
Or get fucked, mostly...
dealer's choice.

00:38.100 --> 00:39.934
I want you
to tell me the truth.

00:39.969 --> 00:43.071
I need to know if you've ever
mentioned my name to anyone.

00:43.105 --> 00:45.773
Look, I wouldn't want
to ruin a good thing.

00:45.808 --> 00:47.575
You want to enlist
the provost's wife?

00:47.610 --> 00:51.346
Have you ever experienced
an orgasm?

00:53.515 --> 00:55.416
I don't know.

00:55.451 --> 00:57.552
- You would know.
- I would?

00:57.586 --> 00:59.053
Mrs. Scully?

00:59.088 --> 01:01.322
Oh, dr. Langham,
w-what a nice surprise.

01:01.357 --> 01:02.933
Can I walk you to your car?

01:07.129 --> 01:08.863
I think you should
have a different title.

01:08.897 --> 01:11.165
'Cause you're not
just a secretary, are you?

01:11.200 --> 01:13.835
- What am I?
- You're a research assistant.

01:13.869 --> 01:17.739
Why can some women orgasm without
any genital stimulation whatsoever?

01:17.773 --> 01:20.108
I'd need to see proof of that.

01:21.310 --> 01:25.282
We're scientists.
Let's see.

Season 1, Episode 7
"All Together Now"

02:13.793 --> 02:16.793
Synced by Reef
www.addic7ed.com

02:37.196 --> 02:39.331
- Plateau.
- Plateau

03:17.536 --> 03:20.171
Orgasm.

03:25.065 --> 03:27.033
Resolution.

03:38.491 --> 03:44.896
The plateau state of the male subject
lasted 8 minutes and 31 seconds,

03:46.148 --> 03:50.502
Resulting in his orgasm
and resolution,

03:50.536 --> 03:52.871
But not in the female's.

03:52.905 --> 03:55.079
It's the position.

03:55.165 --> 03:57.035
If our goal is to determine

03:57.051 --> 04:00.578
which position provides
optimum clitoral stimulation,

04:00.613 --> 04:04.926
on a scale of 1-10,
I would give the missionary a 4.

04:08.921 --> 04:10.689
Although, uh...

04:10.723 --> 04:14.697
One instance of data collection
is hardly a wide sampling.

04:14.783 --> 04:19.043
And I-I do think this line
of inquiry is worth pursuing.

04:19.043 --> 04:23.568
So we will bring in subjects
and see what a broad sampling reveals?

04:23.602 --> 04:26.104
While continuing
the work ourselves.

04:36.550 --> 04:39.952
And we'll
have to fill out questionnaires.

04:40.252 --> 04:42.947
If we're going to be
full participants in the study.

04:45.691 --> 04:47.392
Another night.

04:47.426 --> 04:50.845
I'll put the information in the safe
with the other subjects.

04:50.846 --> 04:53.722
Uh, you can close up here.

04:54.300 --> 04:56.203
We'll resume tomorrow.

05:00.005 --> 05:04.709
- Have a good game.
- Have fun. See you soon, boys.

05:29.001 --> 05:31.157
What a...
Nice surprise.

05:31.203 --> 05:33.816
- Are you...
- Here with Barton.

05:33.852 --> 05:38.455
He's playing poker in the card room.
The cigar smoke was nauseating.

05:38.490 --> 05:40.491
- And are you...
- Alone.

05:40.525 --> 05:43.027
My wife's at home
with our little one.

05:43.061 --> 05:46.163
- He has an earache.
- Oh.

05:46.197 --> 05:48.198
So...

05:55.841 --> 05:57.942
I only like the cashews.

06:07.085 --> 06:09.708
- Look, Mrs. Scully...
- Oh, Margaret. Goodness.

06:09.721 --> 06:13.257
- Margaret. Right, right, right.
- Um, I, uh...

06:13.291 --> 06:15.392
Dr. Langham, please.

06:15.427 --> 06:18.028
- I am perfectly...
- No, I-I didn't want you to think...

06:18.063 --> 06:19.863
- Honestly, there is nothing...
- So we're...

06:19.898 --> 06:22.223
Of course. Yes.

06:35.355 --> 06:39.232
Have you spent
much time in New York, doctor?

06:39.659 --> 06:41.894
In New York?

06:41.928 --> 06:47.297
Barton's leaving tomorrow afternoon
for a three-day conference there.

06:47.425 --> 06:53.197
He hates hotel food, so I just
thought if you knew the city,

06:53.231 --> 06:56.233
you might be able to recommend
a restaurant or two.

07:14.319 --> 07:18.822
I'm out early today. I have
an endometrial biopsy first thing.

07:18.857 --> 07:22.580
- Well, can I have ten minutes?
- Uh, I need to get going.

07:22.581 --> 07:24.782
But you can stay if you want...

07:25.130 --> 07:28.410
Or not. I keep a spare key
under the planter in front.

07:32.670 --> 07:35.305
So, can I come back
after class and get things ready

07:35.340 --> 07:37.297
for dinner
with your brother tonight?

07:39.031 --> 07:41.966
I didn't know
that you want to join us.

07:42.001 --> 07:44.916
Yeah. That's fine.

07:44.917 --> 07:46.590
And, sure, if you want
to come back here and cook...

07:46.614 --> 07:48.869
Aren't you worried leaving
me alone in your apartment?

07:48.884 --> 07:52.833
- I don't know. Should I be?
- I'll snoop.

07:52.868 --> 07:56.303
The minute you're out that door, I'm gonna
go through every drawer in the house,

07:56.338 --> 07:57.864
Check every coat pocket.

07:57.887 --> 08:00.833
You'll find old
gum wrappers and spare change.

08:00.834 --> 08:03.678
What about matches with other
girls' numbers written inside?

08:03.712 --> 08:08.082
Toss the old ones.
The new ones you can stack by the phone.

08:14.967 --> 08:18.002
A lovely lady like you?
Convertible... absolutely.

08:18.037 --> 08:21.038
You'll look just like Grace Kelly
in "To Catch a Thief."

08:21.040 --> 08:23.675
I think
we can manage from here, boys.

08:27.880 --> 08:31.182
I was about to use
a crowbar to pry them off of me.

08:31.216 --> 08:32.750
I know what you mean.

08:32.784 --> 08:35.285
Ethan, I cannot
thank you enough for doing this.

08:35.321 --> 08:37.855
Really, are you sure I'm not
taking you away from anything?

08:37.890 --> 08:43.027
Not a thing. I rebuilt a Desoto Firedome
in high school, so I love all this.

08:43.062 --> 08:47.665
I'm not proud of the fact that
I can't tell a crank case from a clutch.

08:47.700 --> 08:51.518
I'm impressed
you know either exists.

08:51.904 --> 08:55.607
So, tell me,
what make were you considering?

08:55.641 --> 08:59.177
- Chevy, Ford...
- Cheap.

08:59.211 --> 09:04.048
My sister popped out
five babies in four years.

09:04.083 --> 09:06.517
A regular baby factory.

09:06.552 --> 09:10.121
I figured
I'd be just the same but...

09:10.556 --> 09:14.568
It's been a year, doctor. And it's
not like we're not giving it our best.

09:14.888 --> 09:19.163
- So you have intercourse regularly?
- Pretty much like rabbits.

09:19.198 --> 09:21.389
Honey.

09:21.850 --> 09:23.865
At least a few times a night.

09:25.717 --> 09:29.186
- Per night?
- My sister swears that's the key.

09:29.220 --> 09:32.356
Frequency... And position.

09:32.921 --> 09:36.157
I see. And that's
the missionary position or...

09:36.339 --> 09:38.929
The <i>reclining lotus</i>.

09:38.963 --> 09:41.431
My sister traveled
to India one summer.

09:41.466 --> 09:45.952
She came back with dengue fever
and a copy of the Kama Sutra.

09:48.130 --> 09:53.543
Well...
Mr. And Mrs. Prescott, um...

09:53.578 --> 09:55.646
We'll start with a series
of tests to rule out

09:55.680 --> 10:00.204
any physical explanation
for why you haven't conceived.

10:00.578 --> 10:06.011
And while I'm helping you,
maybe you can help me.

10:06.024 --> 10:10.260
There is something else I'm working on...
Something you might find interesting.

10:10.295 --> 10:12.920
Uh, a study.

10:14.865 --> 10:18.235
I-I'll get my associate, Mrs. Johnson,
to talk to you about it.

10:18.269 --> 10:22.056
She's... she's better
at explaining this than I.

10:23.841 --> 10:28.045
Virginia! I need some paper work
for the Prescotts.

10:28.079 --> 10:30.914
I'm sorry, dr.
Masters, are you talking to me?

10:35.135 --> 10:38.355
It's Adelaide, sir.
Remember?

10:38.389 --> 10:40.541
What happened to...

10:41.025 --> 10:43.493
- The brunette?
- Ruthanne?

10:43.528 --> 10:46.668
You said that it didn't work out
with her. I'm her replacement.

10:46.669 --> 10:49.466
Well, I can't seem to find
the necessary forms for the Prescotts.

10:49.500 --> 10:51.984
Do you remember
where you left them?

10:52.804 --> 10:54.972
What time
is Mrs. Johnson expected in?

10:55.006 --> 10:59.067
Virginia said I was to help
you with all secretarial matters,

10:59.068 --> 11:01.645
that I was to encourage you
to rely on me.

11:01.723 --> 11:05.326
All right, I'm relying
on you to find Mrs. Johnson.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.190
Now!

11:11.266 --> 11:13.634
You'd be surprised
how many subjects admit

11:13.668 --> 11:16.036
to having lost their virginity
in the backs of cars.

11:18.173 --> 11:20.975
Judith Treap...
she was my first.

11:21.009 --> 11:23.043
That is an unfortunate name.

11:23.078 --> 11:25.212
She made up for it
in other ways.

11:25.247 --> 11:28.013
I'm sure she did.

11:28.617 --> 11:31.986
And you? Let me guess.

11:32.020 --> 11:35.589
High-school quarterback...
Or your math teacher.

11:35.624 --> 11:36.824
No.

11:36.858 --> 11:43.391
- My first boyfriend... Gordon Garrett.
- Oh, lucky dog. Why him?

11:43.664 --> 11:46.161
I was ready.

11:46.368 --> 11:48.936
He was there.

11:48.970 --> 11:53.474
Only years later did I realize
I was probably his first, too.

11:53.508 --> 11:58.078
And they... they put
our yearbook photos together

11:58.113 --> 12:00.514
in the "Prophecy" section.

12:00.548 --> 12:05.686
Mine said "Mrs. Gordon Garrett,
formerly Miss Mary Virginia Eshelman."

12:05.720 --> 12:10.791
And why didn't
Miss Eshelman marry Mr. Garrett?

12:11.824 --> 12:15.072
Because Mr. Garrett
was destined to be a farmer.

12:15.630 --> 12:20.628
And I... I was destined
for something else.

12:23.405 --> 12:27.113
- Harold, Harold, look at this one.
- I think you have competition.

12:27.114 --> 12:29.910
No. I'm already
attached to this car.

12:29.945 --> 12:32.655
So, ready to sign
on the dotted line?

12:34.215 --> 12:38.304
Yes. Yes.
I just need to ask Bill.

12:40.280 --> 12:43.249
They don't make loans to single women.
I need a co-signer.

12:43.250 --> 12:44.500
I can co-sign.

12:44.501 --> 12:48.696
No, Ethan, Bill already signs
my checks. This is... it's easier.

12:48.730 --> 12:51.665
What can be easier
than me, right here,

12:51.700 --> 12:54.001
co-signing
so that you, right now,

12:54.035 --> 12:57.002
can leave this lot
with a new set of wheels?

12:58.340 --> 13:02.237
Unless you'd rather see Myrtle
here drive off in your car.

13:12.764 --> 13:16.242
- Adelaide... Where are you going?
- Home.

13:16.570 --> 13:20.710
Dr. Masters didn't like the way
that I was filing things.

13:20.711 --> 13:25.743
- How were you filing things?
- Alphabetically.

13:30.215 --> 13:34.185
- Adelaide was a very good candidate.
- She was disorganized.

13:34.219 --> 13:37.941
- It was her first day.
- She couldn't spell "anesthesia."

13:37.948 --> 13:40.558
<i>I</i> can't spell "anesthesia."

13:40.559 --> 13:43.361
I found a couple for you
to sign up for the study today...

13:43.395 --> 13:44.829
The Prescotts.

13:44.863 --> 13:47.231
Fine.

13:47.266 --> 13:50.659
I will sign the Prescotts.

13:51.778 --> 13:53.613
But as for these secretaries...

13:53.620 --> 13:55.806
Promoting you
to my research assistant

13:55.841 --> 13:59.924
should not come at the expense
of my practice falling to ruins.

13:59.971 --> 14:03.781
I think we should screen the secretarial
candidates more thoroughly.

14:03.815 --> 14:05.616
And in the meantime,

14:05.651 --> 14:09.086
until we find
someone truly qualified...

14:09.121 --> 14:11.889
- You can resume...
- Uh-uh. No.

14:11.924 --> 14:16.294
No, you cannot demote me after
promoting me. I'm a researcher now.

14:16.328 --> 14:20.865
I'm going to find you
a secretary much better than me.

14:21.268 --> 14:22.902
"Than I."

14:22.936 --> 14:24.804
See?

14:24.838 --> 14:30.229
I'm going to find you a secretary who
knows the difference... And cares.

14:31.833 --> 14:35.002
That would be a gross
violation of medical protocol.

14:35.036 --> 14:37.337
Bill can't handle the stress
of this because of the miscarriage.

14:37.372 --> 14:38.796
But if he didn't know...

14:38.797 --> 14:42.076
He doesn't want you two
to try again. He said it.

14:42.110 --> 14:44.768
- I think he meant it.
- No, Bill always means what he says.

14:44.769 --> 14:48.104
But that doesn't mean Bill always
knows what's best for him.

14:53.077 --> 14:56.379
Ethan, this is not just about
my wanting a baby.

14:56.414 --> 14:59.049
I mean,
of course I want that, but...

14:59.083 --> 15:01.384
I also want
us to love something together,

15:01.419 --> 15:05.188
to worry and take pride and enjoy
something that belongs to both of us.

15:05.223 --> 15:07.190
- We don't have that now.
- That's not true.

15:07.225 --> 15:11.153
Yes, it is. Bill has his work,
which he mostly keeps to himself.

15:11.154 --> 15:15.126
And he listens to me, sort of,
when I talk about my day.

15:15.233 --> 15:19.402
A child smiles
and sits up and walks,

15:19.437 --> 15:22.554
and a couple have that together.

15:23.230 --> 15:26.134
Without it, I'm don't think
I can compete.

15:26.322 --> 15:29.800
I mean, in an odd way, even he and
Virginia have more in common.

15:29.831 --> 15:32.415
Bill is not going to run off with Virginia,
if that's what you're worried about.

15:32.452 --> 15:33.752
I know that.

15:33.786 --> 15:37.624
But maybe someday someone
that he shares a passion with

15:37.714 --> 15:41.417
will have more to offer him
than his wife.

15:51.045 --> 15:53.981
We can resume the capping
with Bill's frozen sperm,

15:54.015 --> 15:55.949
but only if
you and bill have sex...

15:55.984 --> 15:58.275
Regularly.

15:58.720 --> 16:01.522
Otherwise, it's going to look
like an immaculate conception.

16:01.556 --> 16:03.390
As it is,
he'll be suspicious enough

16:03.424 --> 16:05.626
If you wind up pregnant
with his sperm count.

16:05.660 --> 16:08.570
He knows the odds are
essentially a million to one.

16:08.704 --> 16:10.806
We are owed a miracle.

16:11.950 --> 16:15.058
If he thinks I've
intervened, he will have my head.

16:15.092 --> 16:18.482
I will do my part, Ethan.
I promise.

16:18.713 --> 16:20.313
Thank you.

16:25.603 --> 16:29.839
<i>There's three outs left for St. Louis
to get the win, and a call strike one...</i>

16:32.610 --> 16:35.145
<i>Still,
it's the first sign of life...</i>

16:35.179 --> 16:37.893
Here's a little
something till dinner.

16:37.894 --> 16:40.062
Is the fourth quarter
almost over?

16:40.384 --> 16:42.919
Well, it's top of the 9th,
and the Cubs are down by 13.

16:42.953 --> 16:44.387
They could still come back.

16:44.422 --> 16:47.995
I've had D.O.A. patients
with better chances of coming back.

16:48.647 --> 16:52.516
Your kids like baseball?
I'm guessing they're Cardinals fans.

16:52.551 --> 16:53.954
My kids?

16:53.955 --> 16:56.887
- Didn't you tell me she had kids?
- "She?"

16:56.922 --> 16:58.889
Who?

17:00.480 --> 17:01.692
Ah, hell.

17:01.726 --> 17:06.078
I... you know, I... I was confusing you
with our friend, uh, uh, Jack's girl.

17:06.079 --> 17:08.401
It's my mistake.
I think I've had a few too many.

17:08.458 --> 17:11.260
Yeah, I'll say.
I'm cutting you off now.

17:24.007 --> 17:26.395
I didn't wrap it.

17:26.411 --> 17:28.946
Cashews.

17:54.992 --> 17:56.559
Hi.

18:07.605 --> 18:09.706
Are you waiting for somebody?

18:09.740 --> 18:12.807
- A friend, yes.
- It's cold.

18:13.477 --> 18:18.181
- Can I sit in your car till he comes?
- Who says it's a "he"?

18:18.215 --> 18:20.049
And no,
I think I'll wait alone.

18:21.919 --> 18:23.720
Close the door.

18:24.952 --> 18:28.141
Everyone's wise to what happens
in this neighborhood, you know.

18:28.187 --> 18:30.829
It's where faggots
come to get fucked.

18:31.929 --> 18:33.830
Come on!

18:46.110 --> 18:48.478
Money. It's in my briefcase.
Take it.

18:48.512 --> 18:51.014
Hey! Hey!

18:51.048 --> 18:53.683
- Cops are on their way.
- Bullshit.

18:53.717 --> 18:56.603
Wanna wait and find out?

18:57.677 --> 19:00.194
Come on. Come on. Come on.

19:02.272 --> 19:04.874
Jesus Christ.

19:13.070 --> 19:14.904
You can't take me to the E.R.

19:14.939 --> 19:17.440
Are you mad?
You need a doctor.

19:17.475 --> 19:19.909
I am a doctor.

19:19.944 --> 19:21.626
I told you
not to meet me there.

19:21.645 --> 19:26.783
We should've met at the train station
or in New York, for Christ's sake.

19:26.817 --> 19:29.786
I can't have
anyone see me like this.

19:36.293 --> 19:38.294
Say, which chair is his?

19:38.329 --> 19:42.234
Over by the window.
He likes the view.

19:48.939 --> 19:51.168
Are these his glasses?

19:59.283 --> 20:02.485
- I've got 20/20 vision.
- And I've got a meatloaf sandwich.

20:06.257 --> 20:09.659
- But if you don't like it...
- No, no. This is great.

20:21.505 --> 20:26.543
Say, what would the provost
say if he walked in right now?

20:26.577 --> 20:28.378
Does he own a gun?

20:28.412 --> 20:31.180
Barton? Lord, no.

20:35.252 --> 20:37.854
You're something,
you know that?

20:37.888 --> 20:40.590
Last time someone poured me milk
I was 10.

20:40.624 --> 20:43.645
And look how much you've grown.

20:50.254 --> 20:54.170
Drink up now. You're going
to need your strength.

20:57.074 --> 20:58.842
I was 15.

20:58.959 --> 21:03.207
- Where did it take place?
- In the back of a Plymouth.

21:03.948 --> 21:07.050
And how old were you when
you first had sexual intercourse?

21:07.084 --> 21:11.666
20...
in a cabin on Rainbow Lake.

21:11.877 --> 21:15.525
Did you have sexual intercourse
with your spouse before marriage?

21:15.559 --> 21:17.827
I did not.

21:17.861 --> 21:21.464
- Did you?
- Yes, with both marriages.

21:21.498 --> 21:25.168
I suppose it never occurred
to me to wait until marriage.

21:26.804 --> 21:31.975
If currently married, how frequently
do you have coitus with your spouse?

21:34.478 --> 21:36.546
Uh, we're...

21:36.580 --> 21:39.481
Not having coitus presently.

21:39.482 --> 21:42.218
Because of the miscarriage.
I should have skipped that question.

21:42.252 --> 21:43.620
It's all right.

21:43.654 --> 21:46.656
Uh, how frequently do you have
coitus with a partner?

21:46.690 --> 21:50.827
- I don't have a partner at present.
- Meaning you're not having coitus?

21:50.861 --> 21:52.962
Meaning no,
not right now.

21:54.765 --> 21:56.966
Last question before we start.

21:57.001 --> 21:59.902
Does emotional attachment
play a significant role

21:59.937 --> 22:01.971
in your ability to enjoy sex?

22:02.006 --> 22:04.941
A significant role...
hard to say.

22:04.975 --> 22:08.060
But... Yes, I suppose so.

22:08.061 --> 22:10.980
A qualified yes.
And you?

22:11.015 --> 22:13.950
Not really.
I mean, it can,

22:13.984 --> 22:15.418
but... It's a curious thing.

22:15.452 --> 22:18.126
I've always felt different
from other women.

22:18.167 --> 22:19.368
Most women...

22:19.402 --> 22:22.237
They want love
when they sleep with a man.

22:22.272 --> 22:24.239
But...

22:24.274 --> 22:26.975
I've always been able
to separate sex from love.

22:48.232 --> 22:50.600
- Bill.
- Mm-hmm?

22:50.601 --> 22:52.735
You're humming.

22:53.036 --> 22:54.989
Am I?

22:56.205 --> 23:01.743
Well, it would appear our efforts
were more successful this time...

23:01.778 --> 23:03.879
According to the data.

23:03.913 --> 23:07.482
You orgasmed...

23:07.517 --> 23:09.820
H-how many times?

23:09.843 --> 23:11.586
What does the readout say?

23:11.621 --> 23:16.240
Well, I think an anecdotal
confirmation is also valuable.

23:17.527 --> 23:20.796
Two times.
I orgasmed twice.

23:20.830 --> 23:23.598
- In positions two and four?
- Three and four.

23:23.633 --> 23:25.100
Three and four. So...

23:25.134 --> 23:28.027
Male superior,
female knee to chest

23:28.028 --> 23:31.122
and female superior rear facing.

23:31.140 --> 23:34.910
No, position three was
female superior, both front facing.

23:34.944 --> 23:38.465
- No, that was knee to chest.
- No, we started with knee to chest.

23:38.480 --> 23:40.916
There was significantly
more clitoral stimulation

23:40.950 --> 23:43.040
in, for example, position four.

23:43.058 --> 23:45.954
<i>The reclining lotus.</i>

23:48.024 --> 23:50.425
It's from the Kama Sutra.

23:50.460 --> 23:52.761
Anyway...

23:52.795 --> 23:55.263
This is interesting.

23:55.298 --> 24:01.003
We both orgasmed in the same position, but
I seem to have arrived first both times.

24:01.037 --> 24:04.239
I came two minutes
before you here...

24:04.273 --> 24:07.509
And four minutes earlier.

24:07.543 --> 24:12.514
Well, that may have been a function
of etiquette as much as biology.

24:12.548 --> 24:16.852
Ladies first?
You are a gentleman.

24:18.369 --> 24:21.390
A hungry gentleman.

24:21.424 --> 24:24.536
Maybe we should get a bite...
go for dinner somewhere.

24:33.202 --> 24:34.703
Masters.

24:34.737 --> 24:38.306
I was hoping you were
already on your way, daddy.

24:38.341 --> 24:42.811
<i>We decided this morning to have
an evening to ourselves. Remember?</i>

24:42.845 --> 24:45.265
Of course.

24:45.266 --> 24:49.584
- Uh, I should be leaving shortly.
- All right.

24:49.619 --> 24:51.787
Drive fast...
not too fast.

24:52.320 --> 24:54.624
I will do both.

25:00.238 --> 25:04.608
I just realized...
I was due home an hour ago.

25:10.273 --> 25:12.574
Uh, you're unzipped.
Here. Let me.

25:12.608 --> 25:15.343
Oh, I'll get it.
Good night.

25:53.733 --> 25:55.911
Barton?

25:57.086 --> 25:58.672
What the hell?

25:59.039 --> 26:00.889
I was robbed.

26:00.923 --> 26:04.675
- Why aren't you at emergency?
- It's not serious.

26:10.266 --> 26:13.778
Lie down.
Come on. Lie down.

26:17.865 --> 26:21.076
The train didn't leave for an hour.

26:21.110 --> 26:29.443
I had time to kill. So I... I parked
behind those theaters on Market Street.

26:29.531 --> 26:32.594
I mean,
it's not a bad neighborhood.

26:32.655 --> 26:34.927
I figured I'd use the time to...

26:36.592 --> 26:38.593
...Plan my trip.

26:38.628 --> 26:45.184
When out of nowhere, these hoodlums
walk up to my car with a knife.

26:45.348 --> 26:46.981
And for absolutely no reason...

26:46.996 --> 26:50.520
For god's sake, Barton.
I know why you're not at the hospital.

26:50.611 --> 26:53.679
I know why there are no police
here asking questions.

26:53.753 --> 26:57.297
So just say nothing if you want,
but don't lie to me.

26:58.794 --> 27:03.063
- People can't know about this.
- Obviously.

27:03.098 --> 27:06.965
- I could lose my family.
- You could lose everything.

27:07.230 --> 27:11.466
You <i>will</i> lose everything...
If you carry on like this...

27:11.907 --> 27:16.710
Your job, your reputation,
your medical license.

27:16.745 --> 27:21.421
Is it worth it, just to meet
some boy in an alley?

27:23.351 --> 27:26.687
Everything you've spent
a lifetime building for yourself...

27:26.721 --> 27:29.535
For this university?

27:30.058 --> 27:34.286
You think Margaret
and Vivian will stand by you...

27:34.738 --> 27:36.564
When this all comes out?

27:36.598 --> 27:38.833
It's not going to come out.

27:38.834 --> 27:42.292
You nearly got killed tonight,
Barton, For sitting in a car.

27:49.307 --> 27:51.142
You can do your shirt up.

27:58.920 --> 28:02.723
- I can go again.
- See, I like that about you.

28:02.757 --> 28:05.303
You get on top this time.

28:23.532 --> 28:26.768
Austin, someone's coming.

28:26.802 --> 28:28.236
Would that someone be you?

28:28.271 --> 28:33.241
No, Austin,
there's someone in the driveway.

28:33.276 --> 28:35.517
Who is it?

28:36.112 --> 28:37.779
My husband.

28:45.054 --> 28:49.024
Margaret, I'm sorry.
Did I wake you?

28:49.058 --> 28:51.126
I was up.
I wasn't expecting you.

28:51.160 --> 28:54.596
The train, a problem
with the track and, uh...

28:54.630 --> 28:57.295
Anyway, New York is off.

28:59.089 --> 29:00.723
What's wrong, dear?

29:08.068 --> 29:11.657
I need you to go to your
bedroom, Barton, and stay there.

29:13.261 --> 29:15.134
Please.

29:40.810 --> 29:45.880
<i>Forward. And back.
Now up. And down.</i>

29:45.915 --> 29:48.049
<i>One and two.</i>

29:48.084 --> 29:50.552
<i>Three and four.</i>

29:52.521 --> 29:54.489
<i>Forward and back.</i>

29:54.523 --> 29:58.108
- I'm sorry I'm...
- There he is.

29:58.221 --> 30:02.098
The very man who bought me
my first Martini.

30:02.113 --> 30:05.433
Remember?
Majestic ballroom?

30:07.203 --> 30:10.839
You danced
to the Lester Lanin band.

30:13.275 --> 30:14.709
I was 27.

30:15.648 --> 30:18.446
Would have climbed
the Matterhorn to impress you.

30:18.481 --> 30:20.899
You didn't have to, did you?

30:29.091 --> 30:34.427
Just a hint of vermouth,
like at Vito’s.

30:34.825 --> 30:36.831
It took some trial and error.

30:39.368 --> 30:43.705
- Is that all you've had to eat?
- I don't have an appetite.

30:43.739 --> 30:45.974
Not for dinner, anyway.

30:49.255 --> 30:52.691
Libby, I've had a long,
trying day.

30:52.725 --> 30:55.394
So unwind with your wife.

30:55.428 --> 30:56.695
Pretend you're 27 again.

30:56.729 --> 30:58.957
No, I think
I'll draw you a bath instead.

30:58.965 --> 31:01.033
Good idea...
we can get in together.

31:01.067 --> 31:02.634
No, no, no, no, no.

31:02.669 --> 31:05.604
The tub
won't accommodate us both.

31:05.638 --> 31:07.839
I'll put on some hot coffee.

31:52.285 --> 31:53.919
The cards won yesterday.

31:58.936 --> 32:00.759
Aren't you even going to ask?

32:02.261 --> 32:06.722
- About your guest? No. I'm not.
- And why is that?

32:07.035 --> 32:09.870
I trust you to tell me
what I need to know.

32:09.904 --> 32:12.007
"You trust me...?"

32:12.607 --> 32:18.412
Last night, your wife was upstairs in her
room, in your house, with another man.

32:20.749 --> 32:24.418
- That... that doesn't bother you?
- Of course it does.

32:24.452 --> 32:27.554
Well, then...
then act like it matters!

32:27.589 --> 32:31.391
- Act like I matter! Yell at me.
- I don't want to yell, Margaret.

32:31.426 --> 32:35.028
Because of what you've been up to?
Is that it? People in glass houses?

32:35.063 --> 32:36.692
I don't know
what you're talking about.

32:36.693 --> 32:39.651
I know
there have been other women.

32:40.743 --> 32:43.737
- No.
- I'm not blind. I... I...

32:43.772 --> 32:46.441
All your late nights,
the out-of-town conferences.

32:46.442 --> 32:49.070
I am the provost
of a major university.

32:49.077 --> 32:51.211
Yes,
you're a very important man

32:51.246 --> 32:55.582
who has not laid a hand
on his wife in six years.

32:55.617 --> 32:59.423
There are
no other women, Margaret.

33:01.703 --> 33:03.851
Then it's me.

33:04.494 --> 33:07.789
You don't want to fight for me

33:07.790 --> 33:10.330
because
you don't want me anymore.

33:10.963 --> 33:14.359
I can't imagine
my life without you.

33:15.136 --> 33:20.909
Everything I have,
everything that matters to me,

33:21.479 --> 33:23.343
I have because of you.

33:23.344 --> 33:25.912
But you don't want me,
do you, Barton?

33:25.913 --> 33:29.878
You don't want to...
Make love to me.

33:30.306 --> 33:34.836
- Why? What is wrong with me?
- Nothing.

33:35.177 --> 33:37.879
You are the most beautiful woman
in the world to me.

33:37.913 --> 33:40.808
Then why are we like this?

33:41.984 --> 33:44.285
Answer me.

33:49.858 --> 33:53.661
What is wrong with you?!
W-what is wrong with you?!

33:53.696 --> 33:56.331
Oh, God.

34:03.105 --> 34:05.239
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

34:05.274 --> 34:07.909
Good morning.

34:07.943 --> 34:09.744
Jane.

34:09.777 --> 34:11.746
Your new secretary.

34:11.780 --> 34:15.016
Dr. Masters, so nice
to be working with you again...

34:15.042 --> 34:17.810
This time, with my clothes on.

34:19.237 --> 34:21.103
Virginia, my office, please.

34:21.135 --> 34:24.679
Before you disappear, you have
six patients scheduled this morning.

34:24.679 --> 34:26.755
The first, Mrs. Holloway,
is at 9:30.

34:26.784 --> 34:28.585
You have a lunch
with a Dean Braverman.

34:28.620 --> 34:30.920
I wasn't sure if his name was
Dean or he is a dean,

34:30.956 --> 34:33.456
so I made a reservation at
the faculty club just in case.

34:33.492 --> 34:36.159
And, um, if you notice a smell
in your office,

34:36.194 --> 34:37.795
I had Jerry from maintenance

34:37.829 --> 34:41.831
attend to that coffee stain
on the carpet beside your desk.

34:42.003 --> 34:43.966
Thank you.

34:44.835 --> 34:48.773
There's one more thing
that Jane would like to tell you.

34:50.175 --> 34:51.876
"anesthesia."

34:51.909 --> 34:57.191
A-n-e-s-t-h-e-s-i-a.

34:57.328 --> 34:59.382
"Anesthesia."

35:14.432 --> 35:16.367
Good morning, sir.

35:24.810 --> 35:28.712
- Good night?
- What's that?

35:28.747 --> 35:31.081
Did you have a good night?

35:32.201 --> 35:33.528
Fine.

35:39.157 --> 35:41.659
You have a great day, sir.

35:45.463 --> 35:47.364
Hi.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.101
Libby.

35:53.038 --> 35:56.807
- Bill has a lunch.
- I assumed. Um...

35:56.842 --> 36:00.010
I'm actually here for my follow-up
appointment with Ethan.

36:00.381 --> 36:04.184
And I thought I would pop in
and see you.

36:05.650 --> 36:08.262
Um, you don't have an aspirin,
do you?

36:09.821 --> 36:13.562
It's a hospital.
We even have morphine if you want.

36:15.067 --> 36:17.535
Actually, um...

36:20.599 --> 36:24.076
There's something else that
I hoped you could help me with.

36:26.798 --> 36:30.174
Bill's been coming home late
recently...

36:30.208 --> 36:34.645
- A lot, often past 10:00.
- The study...

36:34.679 --> 36:37.014
The research has entered
a new phase.

36:37.048 --> 36:39.717
I-I know how important
the study is to him.

36:39.751 --> 36:40.885
I suppose to both of you.

36:40.919 --> 36:46.538
It's just, he's so tired
when he gets home, and...

36:48.159 --> 36:54.431
We haven't been finding time
for each other.

36:55.223 --> 36:57.759
Time
that a husband and wife need.

36:58.888 --> 37:00.556
You haven't?

37:01.006 --> 37:04.584
I just thought if you could get
him home before he's dead on his feet...

37:04.609 --> 37:08.292
I actually don't
handle Bill's schedule anymore.

37:08.293 --> 37:10.714
Right. It's Jane now.

37:13.829 --> 37:15.930
Should I be talking to her?

37:18.767 --> 37:22.503
No. No.
You don't have to say another word.

37:22.538 --> 37:24.806
I will find a way
to shift things around.

37:24.840 --> 37:27.008
Don't worry.

37:28.544 --> 37:31.179
This is absolutely
no concern of yours.

37:31.213 --> 37:33.755
She came to me.

37:34.883 --> 37:37.718
And you couldn't say, "I don't
feel comfortable discussing this"?

37:37.753 --> 37:41.055
She's my friend, Bill.
She was asking me for help.

37:41.089 --> 37:43.908
You know, Jonas Salk
volunteered himself and his family

37:43.926 --> 37:46.510
to be the first test subjects
for the polio vaccine.

37:46.541 --> 37:49.664
Werner Forssmann inserted
a urethral tube into his elbow,

37:49.698 --> 37:51.132
pushed it to his heart,

37:51.166 --> 37:55.790
then x-rayed himself to prove that
cardiac catheterization is possible.

37:56.205 --> 37:58.206
There is a long
and very healthy tradition

37:58.240 --> 38:02.278
of scientists making themselves
the subject of their own studies.

38:03.779 --> 38:06.347
Well,
I-I can't continue this work

38:06.381 --> 38:08.983
If it comes at the expense
of your marriage.

38:09.017 --> 38:12.086
I am not discussing
my sex life with you.

38:12.120 --> 38:14.864
According to Libby,
there's little to discuss.

38:16.849 --> 38:23.831
I am very clear on where the line is
between you and me and what we do here.

38:23.866 --> 38:26.715
- It is for the work.
- I don't need you to tell me that.

38:26.731 --> 38:30.534
So then whatever goes
on between us can't affect Libby.

38:33.475 --> 38:35.176
It won't.

38:35.210 --> 38:37.899
Just so we have
an understanding.

38:41.636 --> 38:46.944
So as soon as you and Libby
are back to normal,

38:47.334 --> 38:50.436
then you and I
can continue our work.

38:56.331 --> 38:57.431
Gini.

38:57.466 --> 39:00.701
Ethan,
what are you doing here so late?

39:00.736 --> 39:05.294
Delivering a linebacker
...11 pounds, 7 ounces.

39:05.295 --> 39:09.143
You could stick a helmet on this
kid and draft him right now.

39:09.177 --> 39:12.146
- Bill.
- Dr. Haas.

39:17.386 --> 39:21.022
Ethan, I've been
meaning to tell you the kids...

39:21.056 --> 39:22.857
They just love the car.

39:24.726 --> 39:27.762
Uh, well,
it's a good family car.

39:27.796 --> 39:30.091
I'm happy I could help.

39:34.736 --> 39:36.904
Bill?

39:41.877 --> 39:43.878
You home early?

39:51.186 --> 39:53.354
I'm locked out.

39:58.226 --> 39:59.603
Scared me to death.

39:59.604 --> 40:02.697
I saw your car in the driveway,
but I didn't know where you'd gone...

40:02.731 --> 40:05.800
I went to get some firewood
from the stack behind the garage.

40:05.834 --> 40:07.535
The door slammed shut.
I got locked out.

40:07.569 --> 40:10.972
- You're shivering.
- Because it's freezing.

40:13.241 --> 40:15.231
There.

40:16.411 --> 40:18.112
That's a nice look on you.

40:28.423 --> 40:30.992
I thought, uh,

40:31.026 --> 40:33.294
we could have dinner in front
of the fire tonight.

40:34.046 --> 40:37.732
You did? We haven't
done that in a long time.

40:37.766 --> 40:41.330
I'll go get dressed,
start dinner.

41:20.676 --> 41:22.310
I've missed you.

41:31.734 --> 41:34.488
Isn't the hotel on Sycamore?

41:34.523 --> 41:36.891
You mind if we get
something to eat first?

41:36.925 --> 41:40.428
No. No.

41:40.462 --> 41:43.130
Who do you think
he thinks I am?

41:44.433 --> 41:48.384
One of those golf pros at the club?
Maybe the handyman?

41:48.904 --> 41:53.378
I've never had any secrets from him.
But now I have you.

41:53.425 --> 41:58.345
And I want to keep you to myself
and at the same time, tell everyone.

41:58.380 --> 42:00.981
But you won't, right?

42:01.016 --> 42:03.117
I guess
what I'm saying is...

42:03.151 --> 42:06.828
There are these moments
when everything changes.

42:06.829 --> 42:10.658
Like the moment a nurse hands
you this little bundle

42:10.692 --> 42:14.762
and says, "Here is
your daughter, Mrs. Scully."

42:14.796 --> 42:19.502
Or your dad clutches your hand
as you walk down the aisle

42:19.503 --> 42:22.072
and you realize he's crying.

42:23.949 --> 42:30.678
Or the moment a very handsome young
doctor turns to you outside a theater

42:30.712 --> 42:33.881
and asks,
"Did you like the movie?"

42:33.915 --> 42:38.048
And suddenly
everything is different.

42:39.986 --> 42:44.039
You have saved my life,
dr. Langham.

42:51.766 --> 42:56.270
I don't have a thing for older women.
I have a thing for women.

42:58.573 --> 43:01.001
Okay, so maybe
Margaret could be my mother.

43:01.002 --> 43:04.011
B-but Jane was this...
Adventuress.

43:04.012 --> 43:07.081
She was a girl I could have
sex with while people watched.

43:07.115 --> 43:11.952
Tracy before that... she was...
she was a sex kitten.

43:11.987 --> 43:17.224
Diane was...
Unapproachable ice queen.

43:17.259 --> 43:21.629
So all of the women
in your life have been a type.

43:21.663 --> 43:24.711
Have any of them
been a person to you?

43:24.821 --> 43:27.268
See,
another stupid shrink question.

43:27.302 --> 43:31.438
Listen, all I know is
I was driving with Margaret,

43:31.473 --> 43:33.207
I was feeling great.

43:34.235 --> 43:36.418
I was gonna eat
a plate of linguini,

43:36.419 --> 43:39.213
we were gonna go to the hotel,
hump our brains out.

43:39.247 --> 43:42.283
That's a fun evening.
Am I right?

43:42.317 --> 43:44.513
And what happened?

43:46.021 --> 43:49.990
You know the high striker
at the amusement park...

43:50.025 --> 43:54.840
That thing where you take
the mallet and try to ring the bell?

43:56.698 --> 43:59.767
What if you took a whack at that
thing and the bell suddenly said,

43:59.801 --> 44:05.039
"Oh, my God. Oh, my God,
thank you.

44:05.073 --> 44:10.248
That feels so amazing, and I've never
been this happy in my entire life."

44:12.379 --> 44:14.915
It's not so much fun then,
anymore, is it?

44:14.950 --> 44:18.519
So the bell you're trying
to ring becomes animate...

44:18.553 --> 44:21.123
Becomes a person.

44:22.090 --> 44:24.994
Isn't our time almost up?

44:32.071 --> 44:33.905
Smart of you.

44:33.939 --> 44:38.435
Of course no one would know me
on the pediatric ward.

44:38.436 --> 44:40.821
Yes, I'm full of tricks today...

44:40.822 --> 44:43.424
Sneaking you in here,

44:43.932 --> 44:46.534
stealing your husband's sperm
from the sperm bank.

44:46.544 --> 44:49.483
I know you're angry
with me, Ethan.

44:50.533 --> 44:52.734
But I will just say this.

44:55.057 --> 44:57.518
You're saving my life...

44:58.193 --> 44:59.727
And Bill's.

44:59.761 --> 45:04.372
And if there is any way
that I could ever repay you...

45:06.935 --> 45:08.769
Before we do the capping...

45:13.341 --> 45:15.876
Can you...

45:15.910 --> 45:20.781
Look in this catalogue and
pick out some new sheets for me?

45:20.815 --> 45:23.684
Sheets a girl would like,

45:24.313 --> 45:27.082
That would make her feel
at home.

45:27.168 --> 45:31.592
Of course.
I would be happy to.

45:36.398 --> 45:39.252
Honeyed linen.

45:39.801 --> 45:41.869
I think its bran.

45:41.903 --> 45:46.040
No, the, um,
the shade of my new bedding...

45:46.074 --> 45:49.109
- For the apartment.
- You bought new bedding?

45:49.144 --> 45:51.779
Now that I've got a pretty
girl spending the odd night,

45:51.813 --> 45:54.648
I figured
I better spruce the place up.

45:58.353 --> 46:01.358
You like me staying over
every now and then?

46:01.359 --> 46:03.127
I do.

46:05.360 --> 46:08.429
My last girlfriend, she didn't
like spending the night.

46:08.463 --> 46:11.332
She has two kids... that's what
David was talking about.

46:11.366 --> 46:13.657
He got confused.

46:13.665 --> 46:16.370
Why are you telling me this?

46:16.404 --> 46:19.873
You said you wanted to snoop.

46:19.908 --> 46:23.028
Well, this is what you'll find.

46:23.522 --> 46:25.956
I had my heart broken.

46:28.183 --> 46:30.617
Is it over between you two?

46:33.221 --> 46:34.521
It is.

46:36.691 --> 46:39.745
I thought that we could
still be friends but...

46:39.862 --> 46:41.662
That's the past.

46:41.696 --> 46:45.766
You, me, honeyed linen, huh?

46:45.800 --> 46:48.802
That's the future.

46:48.837 --> 46:53.784
You, Vivian Scully...
you're my future.

47:02.050 --> 47:04.978
Are you actually late,
dr. Masters?

47:04.979 --> 47:07.525
When are we bringing in
the next batch of study subjects?

47:07.562 --> 47:09.997
I have four couples
for tomorrow night...

47:10.037 --> 47:12.038
- The Prescotts included.
- Good.

47:12.072 --> 47:14.073
Then if you're free
this evening,

47:14.108 --> 47:16.976
you and I can resume
our participation in the work.

47:17.011 --> 47:19.145
The matter
you were concerned about...

47:19.179 --> 47:20.580
It's been rectified.

47:20.614 --> 47:22.115
I'm so glad.

47:22.149 --> 47:23.516
And Libby...

47:23.550 --> 47:26.185
Is looking forward
to having her husband back.

47:26.220 --> 47:29.222
And that is the last
you will hear of it.

47:29.256 --> 47:30.857
You were right.

47:30.891 --> 47:34.914
There are lines we shouldn't cross.
This is one of them.

47:36.030 --> 47:38.836
This, uh...

47:40.426 --> 47:42.928
This is complicated for me.

47:46.140 --> 47:47.340
I mean...

47:50.044 --> 47:52.557
I love my wife.

47:53.213 --> 47:55.214
Okay.

47:55.249 --> 47:57.717
So what happened
the other night...

47:57.751 --> 48:00.169
I can't keep doing that.

48:00.654 --> 48:05.458
That's why, from now on,
it has to be a hotel...

48:05.492 --> 48:09.662
Someplace safe
where we have a routine...

48:09.697 --> 48:11.631
A protocol.

48:19.473 --> 48:22.709
Stitches are still in.

48:22.743 --> 48:25.478
I'll be careful.

48:25.512 --> 48:29.482
I realize
you could have left me there.

48:29.516 --> 48:31.384
Left you? Come on.

48:31.418 --> 48:35.214
You were under
no obligation to care for me.

48:37.458 --> 48:39.559
You could have gotten hurt.

48:39.593 --> 48:43.129
I got jumped last year.

48:43.163 --> 48:47.133
I wished to hell
someone had shown up to help me.

48:50.504 --> 48:52.904
I know.

48:53.734 --> 48:55.735
It's scary.

49:11.291 --> 49:13.844
I'm sorry.

49:14.828 --> 49:19.742
Jane is just so diligent, I couldn't
get her to leave for the day.

49:20.567 --> 49:23.970
She felt there were too many
hand notations in your wheeldex,

49:24.004 --> 49:26.405
so she stayed
to retype the entire thing.

49:26.440 --> 49:29.008
I was thinking
tonight...

49:29.042 --> 49:33.630
Female superior, both sitting,
partially reclined.

49:33.653 --> 49:36.883
The angle might be optimal
for clitoral stimulation.

49:36.917 --> 49:39.140
<i>The rocking horse.</i>

49:40.387 --> 49:42.188
I looked it up.

49:47.361 --> 49:49.996
She has been doing a good job,
though, don't you think?

49:50.030 --> 49:53.248
Who, Jane?
She's adequate.

49:53.249 --> 49:56.102
She's lasted two full days.

49:56.136 --> 49:59.088
That's two more days
than her predecessors.

50:00.174 --> 50:03.523
And be honest.
Hasn't she met all your needs?

50:12.386 --> 50:16.889
Last week, I got a thank-you
note from Chancellor Fitzhugh's wife.

50:16.924 --> 50:21.594
Apparently, I sent zinnias
for her 60th birthday.

50:21.628 --> 50:26.178
I don't think I could pick
Stella Fitzhugh out of a police lineup.

50:28.268 --> 50:32.014
- Plateau.
- Plateau

50:32.372 --> 50:35.141
Or a zinnia, for that matter.

50:35.175 --> 50:37.376
But you can.

50:37.411 --> 50:39.350
And did.

50:44.318 --> 50:48.621
Her name is Estelle,
for the record.

50:48.655 --> 50:52.933
And it's important
to keep the Chancellor happy.

50:57.497 --> 50:59.389
Should I slow down?

50:59.561 --> 51:02.335
Jane will make a fine secretary.

51:02.369 --> 51:06.873
But to really anticipate
someone's needs...

51:06.907 --> 51:09.792
That's a rare thing.

51:15.089 --> 51:18.150
- Eight.
- Nine. Wait.

51:18.185 --> 51:19.886
What?

51:19.920 --> 51:22.054
Catch up.

51:43.343 --> 51:44.710
Orgasm.

52:16.276 --> 52:19.445
We should eat if we're
going to go over the data.

52:19.479 --> 52:22.581
I could pick up some deli
from around the corner,

52:23.165 --> 52:25.066
or we could go out for a bite.

52:25.067 --> 52:28.203
I can't.
I have plans.

52:30.190 --> 52:31.958
At this hour?

52:42.269 --> 52:44.930

52:47.541 --> 52:49.556

52:49.557 --> 52:53.202
