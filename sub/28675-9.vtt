WEBVTT

00:00.010 --> 00:01.269
You just bailed.

00:01.270 --> 00:02.850
Shit was getting weird...

00:02.860 --> 00:05.420
that crib, us playing house.

00:05.430 --> 00:07.140
Then why did you even come to my place?

00:07.150 --> 00:08.909
Maybe I knew you'd open the door.

00:08.910 --> 00:09.950
Can't do this.

00:09.960 --> 00:11.789
Is that you want me to tell Livengood?

00:11.790 --> 00:12.999
I don't care what you tell him.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.088
Would Deran give all this up for you?

00:16.090 --> 00:17.600
Yeah, you want to get dirt on this guy.

00:17.610 --> 00:20.140
- Blackmail.
- I don't like kids.

00:20.150 --> 00:21.670
Well, what about the one in your belly?

00:21.680 --> 00:23.120
You tell Colin yet?

00:23.130 --> 00:24.719
There's this big concert.

00:24.720 --> 00:26.509
We could hit the acts. We
could hit their equipment.

00:26.510 --> 00:28.090
There's money, jewelry.

00:30.480 --> 00:31.990
Tell your nephew I said hi.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.979
Who knew to hit that ambulance?

00:33.980 --> 00:35.380
Somebody's been watching us.

00:35.390 --> 00:37.760
And you and I both know who it is.

00:37.770 --> 00:39.150
What are you gonna do about it?

00:43.140 --> 00:44.400
I'm not gonna do it for you.

00:44.410 --> 00:46.260
She's your problem to deal with.

01:54.430 --> 01:57.580
Cranked up the heat. It's like 90.

01:57.590 --> 02:00.310
You're gonna blow a fuse.

02:00.320 --> 02:03.980
You used to be fun, you know?

02:03.990 --> 02:05.739
When was I fun?

02:05.740 --> 02:08.160
Get in.

02:10.310 --> 02:15.000
Put your feet in, at least.

02:20.420 --> 02:22.880
Remember eighth grade?

02:22.890 --> 02:25.700
Jonathan Peters threw a
basketball at my stomach,

02:25.710 --> 02:27.100
knocked the wind out of me?

02:27.110 --> 02:30.639
You held him under the water
until he scratched you so hard

02:30.640 --> 02:32.370
your arm started bleeding?

02:32.380 --> 02:34.090
Yeah, I remember.

02:34.100 --> 02:37.090
I spent the rest of that
party in the bathroom...

02:38.170 --> 02:39.800
with Julia.

02:41.940 --> 02:44.359
Yeah. That was the first
time she did acid, right?

02:44.360 --> 02:47.430
She thought she was gonna die.

02:47.440 --> 02:49.250
Wouldn't stop crying.

02:52.570 --> 02:54.790
We should have a party.

02:58.010 --> 02:59.280
Anything from J?

02:59.290 --> 03:02.900
No, not for a couple hours.

03:02.910 --> 03:08.160
I bet he feels bad. His
job... you all got hurt.

03:08.170 --> 03:11.580
Smart, though. You can teach him.

03:11.590 --> 03:12.970
Teach him what?

03:14.380 --> 03:18.060
Whatever you need.

03:18.070 --> 03:21.320
You'll let him stay, right?

03:21.330 --> 03:22.600
When Smurf's gone?

03:25.390 --> 03:27.610
Have you tried to call her again?

03:29.430 --> 03:30.949
She's not answering.

03:35.390 --> 03:36.560
What?

03:36.570 --> 03:40.240
Maybe she's not coming back?

03:44.320 --> 03:45.870
Why would you say that?

03:47.540 --> 03:50.719
She might not want you guys
to see her at the end.

03:53.540 --> 03:57.139
Do you think it's time
to tell your brothers?

03:57.140 --> 03:59.930
I mean, if she's gone...

03:59.940 --> 04:03.230
That means you're in charge, right?

04:04.730 --> 04:06.770
You're the oldest.

04:28.410 --> 04:30.630
I wanna watch TV.

04:37.280 --> 04:39.120
You're not going to prison.

04:39.130 --> 04:40.960
I might.

04:40.970 --> 04:43.559
I'm gonna deal with Livengood.

04:43.560 --> 04:45.640
Even if you get him to change his mind,

04:45.650 --> 04:47.630
I'm still gonna do a year, maybe two.

04:47.640 --> 04:50.680
This is happening whether
we like it or not.

04:50.690 --> 04:53.069
And it's not your fault. I did this.

04:53.070 --> 04:56.360
I just got to get my head around it.

04:56.370 --> 04:59.060
I'll ask around, I'll see who
the best lawyers are. Maybe...

04:59.070 --> 05:00.680
No. That's gonna look
like I've got information

05:00.690 --> 05:02.140
that you're trying to protect.

05:02.150 --> 05:05.900
I'm gonna plead out,
use a public defender,

05:05.910 --> 05:08.620
hope that Livengood changes his mind.

05:16.140 --> 05:17.530
It's J.

05:17.540 --> 05:20.160
He wants to have a meeting tonight.

05:20.170 --> 05:23.389
It's fine. Go.

05:23.390 --> 05:25.599
I'm gonna smoke a joint,
see if it knocks me out.

05:25.600 --> 05:28.399
Eh, screw it. I can't sleep anyway.

05:34.090 --> 05:36.949
I'm gonna protect you inside.

05:40.240 --> 05:41.909
If it comes to that.

05:41.910 --> 05:44.450
Which it won't,

05:44.460 --> 05:46.119
'cause Livengood's
gonna change his mind.

05:51.550 --> 05:52.710
Hey, Deran?

05:55.570 --> 05:58.540
Not his kids, okay?

06:19.860 --> 06:22.340
- That feel okay?
- Yeah, that's alright.

06:22.350 --> 06:23.960
Hey.

06:23.970 --> 06:26.150
Hey, Deran.

06:28.210 --> 06:30.420
I'm gonna take a shower.

06:34.010 --> 06:35.970
What's going on with you guys?

06:37.490 --> 06:38.960
What do you mean?

06:38.970 --> 06:42.850
- Are you, like...
- We're friends.

06:44.830 --> 06:46.130
Okay.

06:48.500 --> 06:50.019
How's your shoulder?

06:50.020 --> 06:53.630
Sucks.

06:53.640 --> 06:55.359
How you doing? You alright?

07:01.490 --> 07:02.690
Where's Craig?

07:02.700 --> 07:05.950
I don't know. He hasn't been
picking up my phone calls.

07:07.430 --> 07:09.240
There it is.

07:17.750 --> 07:19.010
How'd you get this?

07:20.710 --> 07:23.290
There's this girl that I've
been hanging out with.

07:24.890 --> 07:28.309
She must've seen me with cash,
overheard a couple phone calls.

07:28.310 --> 07:32.430
I walked in on her a couple
of weeks ago with this guy.

07:32.440 --> 07:33.980
They must've followed me,

07:33.990 --> 07:36.270
figured out that we were
hitting the festival.

07:36.280 --> 07:39.360
I found her. I got it back.

07:39.370 --> 07:41.489
You just asked for it back,
and she gave it to you?

07:41.490 --> 07:43.270
I talked to her.

07:43.280 --> 07:44.280
You talked to her? What do you...

07:44.290 --> 07:45.480
- What do you mean, you talked to her?
- You don't need to worry about it.

07:45.490 --> 07:49.530
- What does that mean, J?
- You don't need to worry about it!

07:51.000 --> 07:54.160
We don't have to worry
about it? We almost die

07:54.170 --> 07:56.499
because of this person, and we
don't have to worry about it?

07:56.500 --> 07:58.580
We got to watch our back
every time we pull a job?

07:58.590 --> 07:59.669
Is that what's gonna happen now?

07:59.670 --> 08:01.679
She's not gonna bother us anymore.

08:04.930 --> 08:07.139
Alright, I messed up. I'm owning it.

08:07.140 --> 08:10.180
Okay, I'll take a loss
on the next few jobs

08:10.190 --> 08:12.400
to make up for the money we
lost on the broken soundboards.

08:12.410 --> 08:15.720
What about Pete? Do we have
a problem with Pete now?

08:15.730 --> 08:17.900
J's girlfriend is a Trujillo.

08:19.190 --> 08:20.270
Isn't that right, J?

08:20.280 --> 08:21.609
Pete didn't know. Pete had no idea.

08:21.610 --> 08:23.270
- You sure about that?
- Yes, I'm sure.

08:23.280 --> 08:25.740
- You sure?
- Yes. It's over.

08:25.750 --> 08:27.989
Okay? I promise.

08:27.990 --> 08:30.539
Your girlfriend kidnap Smurf, too?

08:30.540 --> 08:33.078
Deran, I don't know where Smurf is.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.080
You don't know where Smurf is?

08:41.590 --> 08:45.170
Her little errand boy doesn't
know where Smurf is.

08:45.180 --> 08:47.139
But you know where that was.

08:51.230 --> 08:52.960
I'm getting a beer.

08:56.930 --> 08:59.479
Hold up.

08:59.480 --> 09:02.020
Is there anything else?

09:02.030 --> 09:06.120
- Like what?
- Anything you left out.

09:06.130 --> 09:07.489
No.

09:07.490 --> 09:11.000
Your girlfriend. You, uh...

09:11.010 --> 09:13.360
- You talked to her.
- And I talked to Pete.

09:13.370 --> 09:15.919
He doesn't want to
jeopardize Smurf's business.

09:15.920 --> 09:17.500
So now you're on the hook with Pete?

09:17.510 --> 09:19.380
I paid him.

09:19.390 --> 09:23.390
That's gonna come out of my cut.

09:23.400 --> 09:24.760
This won't happen again.

09:24.770 --> 09:27.000
No, it won't.

09:27.010 --> 09:30.590
'Cause if it does, you
don't get another chance.

10:02.300 --> 10:03.760
What's up?

10:13.790 --> 10:16.510
Smurf has cancer.

10:17.670 --> 10:19.220
What are you talking about?

10:19.230 --> 10:22.859
Couple of weeks ago,
she fell. She hit her head.

10:22.860 --> 10:24.200
I took her to the hospital,

10:24.210 --> 10:27.470
and she made the doctor
tell me that she was sick.

10:35.090 --> 10:37.110
Jesus.

10:37.130 --> 10:40.870
Yeah.

10:40.880 --> 10:42.660
Do you know where she is?

10:42.670 --> 10:44.700
No.

10:44.710 --> 10:46.080
Is she coming back?

10:46.090 --> 10:48.040
I don't know, man.

10:53.570 --> 10:56.620
You really think she'd just
leave for good like that?

10:56.630 --> 10:58.820
You know, no goodbyes? Nothing?

10:58.830 --> 11:01.980
It's Smurf.

11:01.990 --> 11:03.270
Who knows?

11:04.530 --> 11:07.180
Oh, sorry I'm late.

11:11.410 --> 11:13.280
What now?

12:14.530 --> 12:15.690
Janine?

12:29.230 --> 12:31.070
I like these six.

12:31.080 --> 12:32.800
Can you get me more?

12:32.810 --> 12:34.400
Many as you want.

12:34.410 --> 12:36.400
Got 20 in the cellar.

12:36.410 --> 12:38.690
You want more, I get you more.

12:42.590 --> 12:44.410
What are you doing out here?

12:44.420 --> 12:47.969
Reminiscing about the good old days.

12:47.970 --> 12:50.540
Come on.

12:50.550 --> 12:52.890
Odin made supper.

13:09.890 --> 13:11.699
Why are we stopping?

13:15.050 --> 13:17.220
What's going on?

13:17.230 --> 13:19.320
My brother's kind of strange.

13:19.330 --> 13:22.360
Yeah?

13:22.370 --> 13:24.129
Strange as you?

13:27.460 --> 13:29.640
I... They live off the land.

13:29.650 --> 13:34.180
They grow their own food,
chickens, goats, a little grass.

13:35.730 --> 13:39.460
So?

13:39.470 --> 13:42.980
They're hippies.

13:42.990 --> 13:45.320
Not exactly.

13:48.010 --> 13:50.370
Well, I like chickens.

13:56.790 --> 13:58.490
When was the last time you saw him?

13:58.500 --> 14:00.800
A year ago.

14:00.810 --> 14:02.960
When we buried my dad.

14:25.980 --> 14:28.140
- Hey.
- How was the drive?

14:28.150 --> 14:29.980
It was fine. Yeah.

14:29.990 --> 14:31.620
Hey. You got big!

14:31.630 --> 14:32.659
How old are you now?

14:32.660 --> 14:34.980
- Six.
- Six?

14:34.990 --> 14:37.080
All right, let's see you make a muscle.

14:37.090 --> 14:38.289
Let me check.

14:38.290 --> 14:41.440
Ooh! That's good. What's up?

14:41.450 --> 14:43.140
How's it going, Jeremy?

14:43.150 --> 14:44.709
Still shy?

14:44.710 --> 14:47.459
Go in and play, boys. Go on.

14:47.460 --> 14:49.129
Hey, Laney.

14:49.130 --> 14:51.960
- Hi.
- That David?

14:51.970 --> 14:53.290
He looks just like you.

14:58.180 --> 15:00.380
- Janine.
- Oh, yeah.

15:00.390 --> 15:02.460
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

15:02.470 --> 15:03.980
- Hi. Janine.
- Janine. Hi.

15:03.990 --> 15:05.370
- How you doing?
- Good.

15:05.380 --> 15:06.380
Nice to meet you.

15:06.390 --> 15:09.160
Yeah.

15:17.200 --> 15:19.940
You did good, man. Mm?

15:19.950 --> 15:21.210
Thank you.

15:23.490 --> 15:25.079
You guys hungry?

15:25.080 --> 15:27.339
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:27.340 --> 15:28.860
Laney made stew.

15:28.870 --> 15:30.090
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

15:37.470 --> 15:39.010
What are they building?

15:39.020 --> 15:41.880
Quarantine shed.

15:41.890 --> 15:43.439
Someone sick?

15:43.440 --> 15:45.059
Not yet.

15:45.060 --> 15:46.600
Mm.

15:46.610 --> 15:50.120
You put razor wire around
the whole property.

15:50.130 --> 15:51.560
After Laney died.

15:51.570 --> 15:53.310
Only way in and out is the gate.

15:54.790 --> 15:56.740
Someone out to get you, Jed?

16:01.000 --> 16:06.170
Whole damn human race will be
when the shit hits the fan.

16:06.180 --> 16:09.480
Nobody's prepared for what's coming.

16:09.490 --> 16:11.290
What do you think it's gonna be?

16:11.300 --> 16:14.070
Natural disaster? Nuclear apocalypse?

16:14.080 --> 16:17.500
Or maybe just some good,
old-fashioned race riots?

16:17.510 --> 16:20.640
All the above.

16:26.890 --> 16:28.309
Where'd you get these?

16:28.310 --> 16:30.319
From a reputable seller.

16:30.320 --> 16:32.149
That's it? I'm just
supposed to trust you?

16:32.150 --> 16:34.780
We've worked this way for years.

16:38.720 --> 16:40.780
You gonna show me my merchandise?

16:54.280 --> 16:57.290
J, wake up.

16:59.320 --> 17:01.050
Where's Pope?

17:01.060 --> 17:02.330
He's asleep.

17:02.340 --> 17:04.030
They... They were up late.

17:04.040 --> 17:05.470
He told your uncles.

17:05.480 --> 17:07.719
They know that Smurf is sick.

17:07.720 --> 17:09.650
W-We got to move fast.

17:09.660 --> 17:13.490
Pope thinks that she
might already be dead.

17:13.500 --> 17:14.630
He said that?

17:14.640 --> 17:17.170
He thinks that she either killed herself

17:17.180 --> 17:21.250
or she's on some kind of
last bender somewhere.

17:21.260 --> 17:22.589
Do you think he could be right?

17:22.599 --> 17:24.900
I don't know. Maybe.

17:25.880 --> 17:28.410
If she is dead, we got to
get our hands on that will

17:28.420 --> 17:30.239
before the others, make
sure you're in it.

17:30.240 --> 17:34.320
I heard them out by the
pool till almost 3:00.

17:34.330 --> 17:35.610
Where were you?

17:35.620 --> 17:38.740
Sleeping.

17:41.230 --> 17:42.490
Okay.

17:42.500 --> 17:44.350
Well, don't worry about Pope.

17:44.360 --> 17:45.540
I can calm him down.

17:46.860 --> 17:49.790
Well, he told me that
your job went south.

17:49.800 --> 17:51.870
I know they're pissed
at you, but it'll pass.

17:51.880 --> 17:54.630
He told you about the job?

17:54.640 --> 17:58.230
Yeah. He trusts me. It's good.

17:59.900 --> 18:02.970
He'll be in charge now
that Smurf is gone.

18:02.980 --> 18:04.940
I'll make sure he takes care of you.

18:07.470 --> 18:08.830
We'll talk later.

18:30.350 --> 18:32.300
What's up with the new ride?

18:32.310 --> 18:34.560
Scout needed a new transmission.

18:36.880 --> 18:38.490
You alright?

18:38.500 --> 18:40.020
Mm.

18:40.030 --> 18:42.720
Just not buying it, man.

18:42.730 --> 18:43.930
What?

18:43.940 --> 18:45.830
Cancer?

18:45.840 --> 18:48.520
It's bullshit.

18:50.430 --> 18:53.440
Pope said the doctor told him, so...

18:53.450 --> 18:55.710
It was metastasized and
shit. It was everywhere.

18:55.720 --> 18:57.099
Yeah, but she could've
just hired some dude

18:57.100 --> 18:59.830
- to tell him that.
- Why would she do that?

18:59.840 --> 19:02.650
It's Smurf. Why does she do anything?

19:02.660 --> 19:04.430
Just to test him, maybe,

19:04.440 --> 19:08.520
or see if he can keep a
secret or some shit.

19:09.710 --> 19:11.130
I don't know, man.

19:11.140 --> 19:13.440
Cancer? I mean...

19:13.450 --> 19:16.190
That just doesn't take
out Smurf, you know?

19:16.200 --> 19:17.970
Yeah, well, I hate to break it to you,

19:17.980 --> 19:21.550
but cancer kills people
every single day, man.

19:21.560 --> 19:25.250
What, so you think if she's
actually dying, she'd just...

19:25.260 --> 19:27.720
she'd just leave us here?

19:27.730 --> 19:29.069
Yeah, I do.

19:29.070 --> 19:31.550
Smurf isn't thinking about
any of us right now, okay?

19:36.580 --> 19:40.130
Look, I need you to help
me with something today.

19:40.140 --> 19:41.460
Alright.

19:43.890 --> 19:46.390
I got to hurt somebody.

19:46.400 --> 19:48.310
Hurt them how?

19:48.320 --> 19:50.590
Just rough them up a
little bit, nothing crazy.

19:50.600 --> 19:54.510
- Just enough to send a message.
- What's the message?

19:55.820 --> 19:58.330
No, what is it, man?

19:58.340 --> 20:00.590
I just need you to keep the car
running while I'm in there

20:00.600 --> 20:02.310
and get me out of there
fast when I'm done.

20:02.320 --> 20:04.950
Alright?

20:04.960 --> 20:07.700
So the Scout doesn't
need a new transmission.

20:07.710 --> 20:11.530
Who is it?

20:11.540 --> 20:13.259
You gonna help me or what?

20:13.260 --> 20:15.000
Alright.

20:15.010 --> 20:17.190
Alright. Let's go.

20:29.500 --> 20:33.099
Where you headed?

20:33.100 --> 20:34.980
I have work in a couple hours.

20:34.990 --> 20:36.590
I was gonna run some errands.

20:36.600 --> 20:38.270
Do you want to take a drive?

20:39.470 --> 20:40.559
Where?

20:40.560 --> 20:43.310
I've had the GPS on Smurf for a while.

20:43.320 --> 20:44.720
She's sick.

20:44.730 --> 20:47.109
Maybe she went to go and see
her lawyer about her will.

20:47.110 --> 20:50.560
You warming up to me, J?

20:50.570 --> 20:52.760
Are you coming?

20:52.770 --> 20:55.210
Yeah.

21:05.380 --> 21:07.310
You gonna do it here?

21:07.320 --> 21:10.760
Nah. I'm gonna wait till
he leaves, follow him.

21:10.770 --> 21:13.540
Get him somewhere more secluded.

21:13.550 --> 21:15.809
He armed?

21:15.810 --> 21:18.190
Yeah.

21:18.200 --> 21:22.370
Well, you're gonna have to
take him by surprise, then.

21:22.380 --> 21:25.220
Yeah, I know.

21:25.230 --> 21:26.630
What are you gonna use?

21:26.640 --> 21:29.010
I got a bat in the back.

21:30.710 --> 21:33.980
You should take your gun.

21:33.990 --> 21:35.279
Just in case, you know.

21:35.280 --> 21:37.390
I know.

21:45.230 --> 21:46.590
Alright. That's him.

21:49.420 --> 21:50.660
Let's do this.

22:35.550 --> 22:37.920
Odin can handle a compound bow,

22:37.930 --> 22:40.160
hit a target from 100 feet.

22:40.170 --> 22:41.500
I took him out with me last weekend.

22:41.510 --> 22:42.930
He almost got a buck.

22:42.940 --> 22:44.970
Wow. That's impressive.

22:44.980 --> 22:47.680
And Jeremy can pull the
trigger on my pistol.

22:47.690 --> 22:49.850
- He's not even scared of the recoil.
- Oh.

22:49.860 --> 22:52.220
Laney's all worried about him,

22:52.230 --> 22:54.850
but I told her, he's
got to learn to shoot.

22:59.330 --> 23:01.320
This is really good.

23:01.330 --> 23:02.520
- Mm.
- Thank you.

23:02.530 --> 23:04.369
Vegetables are all from the garden.

23:04.370 --> 23:05.820
The boys harvest them.

23:05.830 --> 23:07.879
We're canning everything we don't use.

23:07.880 --> 23:10.380
What's the hole out in the field?

23:12.390 --> 23:13.790
Are you guys building something?

23:16.840 --> 23:18.500
A bunker.

23:18.510 --> 23:20.540
What for?

23:20.550 --> 23:22.019
Jed's stockpiling gold.

23:22.020 --> 23:23.979
Yeah, you watch. I'm right.

23:23.980 --> 23:27.180
Uh, why gold?

23:27.190 --> 23:28.520
Eh, here we go.

23:29.990 --> 23:32.480
- Currency's got to be four things, right?
- Mm-hmm.

23:32.490 --> 23:34.840
One, it's got to be worth something

23:34.850 --> 23:36.779
to enough people to be meaningful.

23:36.780 --> 23:39.590
Two, you got to be able
to divide it up evenly.

23:39.600 --> 23:40.940
Gold is malleable.

23:40.950 --> 23:42.789
You can break it into smaller pieces.

23:42.790 --> 23:45.520
Three, it's got to be uniform.

23:45.530 --> 23:48.220
That's why gems aren't good currency,

23:48.230 --> 23:50.120
'cause nobody can agree on the quality.

23:50.130 --> 23:51.620
But gold is gold.

23:51.630 --> 23:53.830
Last, it's got to be rare.

23:53.840 --> 23:55.220
The money in your pocket,

23:55.230 --> 23:58.000
the money Colin steals from the banks,

23:58.010 --> 24:01.440
the money he would kill for...
that money is worthless.

24:01.450 --> 24:03.040
It's not even money. It's... It's paper.

24:03.050 --> 24:05.580
You could set it on fire, watch it burn.

24:05.590 --> 24:09.040
I will survive when the
world goes pear-shaped.

24:09.050 --> 24:10.520
Will you?

24:18.600 --> 24:21.680
How much gold do you need

24:21.690 --> 24:23.540
when the shit hits the fan?

24:26.250 --> 24:28.499
Least a million.

24:28.500 --> 24:30.379
How much do you got?

24:30.380 --> 24:32.420
Wouldn't you like to know?

24:41.390 --> 24:43.850
- Anyone want dessert?
- We're not done.

24:50.270 --> 24:51.940
Sorry.

24:55.720 --> 24:57.489
Eat.

24:57.490 --> 24:58.739
I'm finished.

24:58.740 --> 25:01.190
No. You're not.

25:45.640 --> 25:47.740
Like what you see?

25:56.430 --> 25:58.000
Everything wiped?

25:58.010 --> 25:59.970
Everything.

26:00.950 --> 26:03.679
What's back there, baby?

26:03.680 --> 26:05.420
More of the same.

26:12.980 --> 26:14.520
Here they are.

26:43.170 --> 26:46.520
That's a cop bar.

26:46.530 --> 26:49.559
Can't hit him here.

26:49.560 --> 26:51.540
There's an alley behind the bar.

26:51.550 --> 26:52.800
I can hit him there. It'll be quick.

26:52.810 --> 26:54.519
We can get out of here fast. Okay?

26:54.520 --> 26:56.519
There's cops crawling everywhere, man.

26:56.520 --> 26:58.440
Look, where's he work?

26:58.450 --> 27:00.670
Maybe we can just hit him there.

27:00.680 --> 27:03.040
- No, we can't.
- Why not?

27:03.050 --> 27:04.220
Because we just can't.

27:04.230 --> 27:05.700
He's got a routine. He comes here.

27:05.710 --> 27:06.720
It's either here or his gym,

27:06.730 --> 27:08.960
and there's too many cameras at the gym.

27:08.970 --> 27:10.560
So then we just run him off the road

27:10.570 --> 27:13.220
someplace we can control.

27:13.230 --> 27:15.110
No. I've been following him, man.

27:15.120 --> 27:16.840
He's got a specific route that he takes.

27:16.850 --> 27:18.940
It's side streets through town,
and then he ends up here.

27:18.950 --> 27:20.020
There's nowhere else I could do it

27:20.030 --> 27:21.549
where there wouldn't be
a hundred witnesses.

27:21.550 --> 27:23.980
So then we just wait till
he mixes it up, then.

27:23.990 --> 27:26.130
Nah. We can't wait. It's got to be now.

27:28.440 --> 27:32.599
What the hell is up with you, man?

27:32.600 --> 27:35.090
This guy a cop?

27:35.100 --> 27:39.060
Is that why we can't hit him at work?

27:39.070 --> 27:40.100
Huh?

27:43.810 --> 27:47.150
Jesus, Deran. A cop?

27:47.160 --> 27:48.480
What's going on? Has he...

27:48.490 --> 27:49.989
has he got something on you, or what?

27:49.990 --> 27:52.940
Because I'm sitting outside
a goddamn cop bar.

27:52.950 --> 27:54.780
I mean, are you trying to go to prison?

28:02.950 --> 28:04.580
Nah. You know what?

28:04.590 --> 28:07.560
I'm out, bro. It's all you.

28:07.570 --> 28:08.960
Craig.

28:08.970 --> 28:10.750
- Craig, come on.
- No.

28:10.760 --> 28:11.960
Craig!

28:11.970 --> 28:13.260
Craig, come on.

28:13.270 --> 28:15.720
No way, man! I'm not gonna
keep the car running

28:15.730 --> 28:17.519
while you take a bat to some cop.

28:17.520 --> 28:20.460
Look, you want to hurt a cop?

28:20.470 --> 28:21.480
You got to tell me why.

28:21.490 --> 28:22.819
Hey, keep your voice down.

28:22.820 --> 28:26.140
You know, here I am
thinking that you trust me.

28:26.150 --> 28:28.800
Yeah, Smurf's got cancer, but
at least Deran's got my back,

28:28.810 --> 28:30.200
because I got his.

28:30.210 --> 28:31.680
He needs my help, I'm here.

28:31.690 --> 28:33.890
He can count on me. But you?

28:33.900 --> 28:35.800
You don't trust me.

28:35.810 --> 28:39.040
You just think I'm too
stupid to ask a question.

28:39.050 --> 28:40.459
It's bullshit.

28:52.020 --> 28:53.970
Smurf came here?

28:53.980 --> 28:56.280
That's what the GPS says.

28:56.290 --> 28:58.210
Well, which one?

28:58.220 --> 29:02.550
It's not that specific, but
it's this general area.

29:02.560 --> 29:05.270
Do you remember this neighborhood?

29:05.280 --> 29:06.650
No.

29:06.660 --> 29:09.190
Your mom and I used to
hang out down here.

29:09.200 --> 29:11.329
I don't think there are
any lawyer's offices.

29:11.330 --> 29:13.310
Maybe she came to meet someone.

29:13.320 --> 29:14.850
You looking for weed or something?

29:14.860 --> 29:16.430
She's got plenty of
people on the payroll

29:16.440 --> 29:18.520
that she doesn't want us to know about.

29:18.530 --> 29:21.750
I had to pay some of them
while she was in jail.

29:21.760 --> 29:25.260
She trusted you with a lot
when she was inside, huh, J?

29:25.270 --> 29:26.960
Yeah.

29:26.970 --> 29:30.220
She knew I was the easiest to control.

29:30.230 --> 29:32.880
You weren't that easy to
control when you were a kid.

29:32.890 --> 29:35.740
Julia always had her hands full.

29:42.590 --> 29:43.950
I'm hungry.

29:43.960 --> 29:45.410
Want to get tacos?

29:45.420 --> 29:47.460
Place looks good.

29:51.590 --> 29:52.740
You okay?

29:52.750 --> 29:56.440
One of the cooks there used to sell H.

29:56.450 --> 29:59.640
Your mom and I used to
score there all the time.

30:02.760 --> 30:04.580
We could go somewhere else.

30:07.720 --> 30:09.540
It's fine.

30:09.550 --> 30:11.500
The tacos are good.

30:21.620 --> 30:23.369
Craig.

30:24.700 --> 30:25.970
The hell do you want?

30:25.980 --> 30:27.459
You weren't picking up your phone.

30:27.460 --> 30:28.640
And?

30:28.650 --> 30:29.930
Renn was passed out in the bathroom

30:29.940 --> 30:31.460
when I came home from work, bleeding,

30:31.470 --> 30:34.299
so I called an ambulance.
She's at the hospital.

30:34.300 --> 30:36.260
A'ight, here's your change.

30:36.270 --> 30:38.660
- Thank you.
- This was you.

30:38.670 --> 30:40.260
Alright. Thank you.

30:40.270 --> 30:42.980
Hey, don't be a stranger, alright?

30:48.070 --> 30:50.670
The shit I used to do for
that guy to get high.

30:52.390 --> 30:55.110
Here's your change.
You gave me too much.

30:56.650 --> 30:58.420
You sure you're okay?

30:58.430 --> 31:00.590
Kind of feels good.

31:00.600 --> 31:03.370
Knowing I could score, choosing not to.

31:05.470 --> 31:07.990
And I'll... I'll catch a meeting later.

31:10.410 --> 31:12.970
You seem different.

31:14.390 --> 31:17.120
If I was an asshole before, I'm sorry.

31:17.130 --> 31:19.070
It's alright.

31:19.080 --> 31:20.449
I deserve it.

31:20.450 --> 31:23.330
No, you don't.

31:23.340 --> 31:26.220
I guess I just wanted to believe
that people can't change,

31:26.230 --> 31:28.030
because my mom didn't.

31:28.040 --> 31:29.710
She tried.

31:33.410 --> 31:35.790
She really did.

31:35.800 --> 31:39.170
If you like living with
the Codys, I won't judge.

31:39.180 --> 31:43.170
Big step up from shitholes like this.

31:43.180 --> 31:47.130
When I first got there, I barely slept.

31:47.140 --> 31:50.229
I'd stay up all night thinking
of ways to kill Smurf.

31:52.720 --> 31:54.130
She's hard to like.

31:56.210 --> 32:00.380
Then I ran the business for a
while when she was in jail.

32:00.390 --> 32:02.650
I liked it, and I was good at it.

32:04.210 --> 32:06.680
So, what?

32:06.690 --> 32:10.590
You think you're gonna take
over when Smurf's gone?

32:10.600 --> 32:12.490
Keys to the kingdom?

32:12.500 --> 32:14.250
Maybe.

32:19.340 --> 32:20.630
You like Pope.

32:22.330 --> 32:24.550
Well, we get each other.

32:28.790 --> 32:29.890
Is this okay?

32:29.900 --> 32:31.930
I didn't know you smoked.

32:31.940 --> 32:33.979
If you don't want me to, I can just...

32:33.980 --> 32:35.750
Just a little weed.

32:35.760 --> 32:38.260
I'll live.

32:42.460 --> 32:44.739
You gave me my first beer. Remember?

32:44.740 --> 32:46.740
I did?

32:46.750 --> 32:48.600
Yeah. I was like 5 or 6.

32:48.610 --> 32:50.329
You were super high.

32:50.330 --> 32:53.950
I asked you for one, and
you just gave it to me.

32:53.960 --> 32:55.290
No questions asked.

32:59.780 --> 33:02.730
Great.

33:02.740 --> 33:05.910
But you also taught me
how to tie my shoelaces.

33:05.920 --> 33:08.830
That was big of me.

33:11.020 --> 33:12.260
Whatever Smurf was doing around here,

33:12.270 --> 33:14.500
she wasn't looking for a lawyer.

33:14.510 --> 33:15.980
I'm gonna go back to the house,

33:15.990 --> 33:17.830
look through her taxes and shit.

33:17.840 --> 33:19.280
Maybe find an address.

33:19.290 --> 33:20.530
You want a lift?

33:22.370 --> 33:25.270
No, I'm okay. I think I'll walk.

33:25.280 --> 33:27.740
Alright. See you later.

33:53.570 --> 33:56.000
Jesus.

33:56.010 --> 33:57.880
What are you doing with my brother?

33:57.890 --> 33:59.960
What?

33:59.970 --> 34:03.460
Beautiful girl like you.

34:03.470 --> 34:05.490
You could do better.

34:46.320 --> 34:48.389
Is Jed always like that?

34:48.400 --> 34:49.409
Like what?

34:52.409 --> 34:56.290
His wife is afraid of him.

35:17.010 --> 35:20.910
Our dad would kick the shit out of us.

35:20.920 --> 35:23.190
And our mom.

35:25.010 --> 35:27.300
He was a real asshole.

35:27.310 --> 35:32.050
He'd get off on scaring us.

35:32.060 --> 35:35.080
And Jed got the worst of it.

35:46.050 --> 35:47.850
Hey.

35:55.590 --> 35:57.430
You're nothing like him.

36:10.210 --> 36:12.630
Lena.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.100
You good?

36:22.110 --> 36:23.440
- Mm-hmm.
- You okay?

36:23.450 --> 36:25.110
Mm-hmm.

36:33.340 --> 36:35.550
You like this ballet class?

36:35.560 --> 36:37.020
How... How's the teacher? You like her?

36:37.030 --> 36:39.520
Mm-hmm.

36:39.530 --> 36:41.800
That's good. That's really good.

36:41.810 --> 36:42.940
Lena!

36:44.230 --> 36:46.560
Bella's looking for you
with the other girls, okay?

36:46.570 --> 36:48.550
Be right there. Go on.

36:50.400 --> 36:52.069
You can't just show up out of nowhere.

36:52.070 --> 36:54.950
Her grandmother's sick. My mom.

36:56.610 --> 36:59.960
I just...

36:59.970 --> 37:02.500
I just needed to see her.

37:03.940 --> 37:06.280
I'm sorry.

37:06.290 --> 37:08.070
Look, we... we can schedule something

37:08.080 --> 37:09.200
if you want to see her.

37:09.210 --> 37:11.770
You gave Lena a good life.

37:11.780 --> 37:13.620
She's happy with us.

37:13.630 --> 37:16.090
Please.

37:24.030 --> 37:25.510
Bye, Lena.

37:36.930 --> 37:39.370
Deran.

37:39.380 --> 37:41.530
Detective Pearce.

37:41.540 --> 37:45.190
Do you, uh, have someplace we can talk?

37:45.200 --> 37:47.190
It's happy hour.

37:48.730 --> 37:50.590
We can do it here.

37:52.460 --> 37:53.550
You know who I am?

37:54.950 --> 37:56.400
Yeah.

37:56.410 --> 37:58.980
Good.

37:58.990 --> 38:00.220
I'm sorry about Benito.

38:01.290 --> 38:02.340
Who?

38:02.350 --> 38:04.260
Ox.

38:04.270 --> 38:05.900
He was a friend of yours, right?

38:05.910 --> 38:08.760
Yeah. When we were kids.

38:08.770 --> 38:10.460
Something happen?

38:10.470 --> 38:13.780
Ah, his body turned up in
a landfill in Tijuana.

38:13.790 --> 38:16.640
Bled out from a gunshot wound.

38:16.650 --> 38:19.270
Jesus.

38:19.280 --> 38:21.880
I'm sorry to hear that.

38:21.890 --> 38:23.740
Yeah, I haven't heard
from him in a long time.

38:23.750 --> 38:25.289
You seen Colby Bennett?

38:25.290 --> 38:26.970
He was a friend of yours, too, right?

38:26.980 --> 38:30.130
Yeah. Oceanside's a pretty small town.

38:31.460 --> 38:34.990
We were looking at Mr.
Bennett for Ox's murder.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.500
They did some petty crimes together...

38:37.510 --> 38:39.960
breaking and entering, stupid shit.

38:39.970 --> 38:43.340
Then Bennett went missing. You
know anything about that?

38:43.350 --> 38:45.000
I don't really know what
you're trying to ask me,

38:45.010 --> 38:48.590
but I got a lot of shit to do, so...

38:48.600 --> 38:53.600
You ever want to talk about
your mother or Pope,

38:53.610 --> 38:56.350
I'll see what I can do about your file.

38:56.360 --> 38:59.200
It's getting pretty thick.

39:02.100 --> 39:05.350
Or maybe...

39:05.360 --> 39:07.749
you want to help out your boyfriend.

39:07.750 --> 39:10.190
Adrian's gotten himself
in a bit of trouble,

39:10.200 --> 39:12.710
but I think you know that.

39:12.720 --> 39:15.049
You want to talk about your family,

39:15.050 --> 39:18.250
I'll see what I can do about Adrian.

39:26.890 --> 39:28.900
This place is nice.

39:44.050 --> 39:45.430
- Hey.
- Hi.

39:48.240 --> 39:49.580
You okay?

39:49.590 --> 39:51.340
I've been better.

40:05.260 --> 40:07.770
Well, you scared the shit out of us.

40:07.780 --> 40:09.560
I know. I'm sorry.

40:09.570 --> 40:12.199
How's the kid?

40:12.200 --> 40:13.910
Big.

40:13.920 --> 40:15.300
Yeah?

40:15.310 --> 40:17.000
Almost 11 pounds.

40:18.360 --> 40:20.340
Wow.

40:24.670 --> 40:26.210
I think he's yours.

40:30.720 --> 40:33.540
It's messed up I don't know, but...

40:33.550 --> 40:36.180
I think he's yours.

40:37.810 --> 40:41.530
I-I don't want anything. I just...

40:43.690 --> 40:46.640
I thought you should know.

40:59.040 --> 41:00.910
- Craig?
- Yeah?

41:00.920 --> 41:02.130
You okay?

41:07.810 --> 41:10.120
Yeah.

41:15.810 --> 41:17.970
Would you take our picture, please?

42:08.350 --> 42:10.950
Are you Daddy?

42:13.340 --> 42:14.460
Is he okay?

42:14.470 --> 42:16.000
Breathing like a champ.

42:16.010 --> 42:19.360
See his mom and dad.

42:19.370 --> 42:20.660
I can get you a cot.

42:20.670 --> 42:22.619
Those chairs aren't very comfortable.

42:22.620 --> 42:25.610
Oh, yeah. That, um...

42:25.620 --> 42:27.020
Yeah, that'd be great.

42:27.030 --> 42:30.620
You guys got a name for him yet?

42:30.630 --> 42:32.830
Nah, she's, um...

42:32.840 --> 42:34.380
She's pretty out of it.

42:34.390 --> 42:36.250
She hasn't decided yet.

42:36.260 --> 42:37.470
Want to hold him?

42:58.300 --> 42:59.770
Good for you! Why don't
you brag about it?

42:59.780 --> 43:01.840
You're my big brother! All
you do is talk tough!

43:01.850 --> 43:03.660
- At least I'm not scared!
- ... my wife...

43:03.670 --> 43:05.829
- At least I'm not scared!
- I'm not scared!

43:05.830 --> 43:08.080
Yes, you are. Prove it! How
come you're out here, huh?

43:08.090 --> 43:09.930
Huh?

43:11.590 --> 43:12.919
Come on!

43:17.050 --> 43:18.670
Get in the house!

43:21.230 --> 43:22.980
Grab your shit, Janine.

43:49.130 --> 43:51.130
Psycho son of a bitch.

43:52.250 --> 43:54.290
I'm pregnant.

43:57.300 --> 44:00.090
You gonna keep it?

44:29.890 --> 44:31.240
Smurf.

44:31.250 --> 44:32.420
Hey, baby.

44:34.350 --> 44:38.700
You weren't answering your phone.

44:38.710 --> 44:40.389
I thought you might be dead.

44:40.390 --> 44:43.340
Sorry to disappoint.

44:43.350 --> 44:44.460
Where were you?

44:44.470 --> 44:47.140
I had some things to take care of.

44:52.070 --> 44:54.970
I told the guys you were sick.

44:54.980 --> 44:56.850
They had a right to know.

44:59.120 --> 45:02.550
I want you to get everybody
here in an hour.

45:02.560 --> 45:03.950
I have a job for us.

45:03.970 --> 45:06.250
- Job?
- Mm.

45:07.730 --> 45:11.600
And this time, I will be joining you.

45:11.610 --> 45:15.810
You boys have been having all
the fun for way too long.

45:17.390 --> 45:18.799
Oh, and baby?

45:18.800 --> 45:20.677
Would you please stay out of my bedroom?
