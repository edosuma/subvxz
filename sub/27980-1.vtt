00:27.819 --> 00:30.820
Please. Please, I'm sorry.

00:30.822 --> 00:32.789
Please!

00:32.791 --> 00:34.490
I don't wanna go in.

00:34.492 --> 00:36.759
Please don't make me go in.

00:36.761 --> 00:38.297
Please.

00:40.831 --> 00:42.000
Please.

00:42.566 --> 00:43.799
Please.

00:43.801 --> 00:44.866
Please.

02:05.517 --> 02:07.716
<i>"A doorway
leading to another world.</i>

02:07.718 --> 02:10.085
<i>A place where nature behaves
differently.</i>

02:10.086 --> 02:11.821
<i>A beautiful...</i>

02:11.823 --> 02:13.755
- osis."
- No, oasis.

02:13.757 --> 02:15.424
Thank you. You know,
your sister's handwriting

02:15.426 --> 02:17.025
just sucks, probably why
she tore out all these pages,

02:17.027 --> 02:18.660
she couldn't read it herself.

02:21.499 --> 02:22.864
Uh, drive's taking
a little longer

02:22.866 --> 02:23.866
than we thought, huh?

02:23.868 --> 02:26.835
We should probably leave
early Sunday morning.

02:26.837 --> 02:29.108
Sunday? I mean, is that even
gonna be enough time?

02:30.007 --> 02:31.141
It's five days.

02:31.143 --> 02:32.845
I mean, how long did you plan
on staying out there?

02:33.845 --> 02:34.944
I don't know. I mean...

02:34.946 --> 02:36.779
But Marylyn is obviously
my priority.

02:36.781 --> 02:38.547
So, what if we don't find her?

02:38.549 --> 02:39.849
Jesus, we will.

02:39.851 --> 02:41.551
Okay? But I have
to be back to work

02:41.553 --> 02:43.785
- by Monday morning.
- Yeah. Me, too.

02:43.787 --> 02:45.654
Yeah, that Days Inn
is really understaffed

02:45.656 --> 02:46.956
this time of year, huh, Gerrik?

02:48.025 --> 02:50.091
Fuck off. It's just temporary.

02:50.093 --> 02:52.128
They'd ship me away if I didn't
fulfill my work visa.

02:52.130 --> 02:54.699
Oh, you are the cutest bellboy.

02:55.532 --> 02:57.132
Kenz, don't worry.

02:57.134 --> 02:58.567
Five days is plenty of time.

02:58.569 --> 02:59.905
We'll find her long before then.

03:00.871 --> 03:01.973
Okay.

03:05.776 --> 03:07.542
How do we know Marylyn
is in trouble,

03:07.544 --> 03:09.545
and not just being Marylyn

03:09.547 --> 03:12.682
and, you know, kicking it out
some hippie commune

03:12.684 --> 03:13.982
or something?

03:13.984 --> 03:15.851
Yeah, I wouldn't put it
past Marylyn.

03:15.853 --> 03:18.688
Okay, well, you guys
don't really understand.

03:18.690 --> 03:21.256
'Cause even if she was
in a hippie commune,

03:21.258 --> 03:22.924
Marylyn would let me know.

03:22.926 --> 03:24.493
I mean, Jesus,
when she went camping

03:24.495 --> 03:26.595
in that glacier last summer,
at Logan's Pass,

03:26.597 --> 03:28.096
she still wrote to me.

03:28.098 --> 03:30.533
And she was
in a fucking glacier.

03:30.535 --> 03:32.767
She wrote to you
from Logan's Pass?

03:32.769 --> 03:33.935
Yeah.

03:33.937 --> 03:35.771
Several times.

03:35.773 --> 03:37.106
Which is more
than I even hear from you.

03:37.108 --> 03:38.773
And you guys
live down the street.

03:38.775 --> 03:42.612
Okay, that's enough of that.

03:42.614 --> 03:47.617
Uh, I definitely didn't expect
the car ride to be so long.

03:47.619 --> 03:49.652
The sun's supposed
to set tonight at 8:45,

03:49.654 --> 03:51.220
so as long as we get there
before then,

03:51.222 --> 03:53.122
and set up our tents,
we'll be fine.

03:53.124 --> 03:54.724
Jesus, we better get there
before then.

03:54.726 --> 03:56.725
I am dying of boredom.

03:56.727 --> 03:57.959
Oh, my god, Gerrik,

03:57.961 --> 03:59.695
you knew how long
this was going to be.

03:59.697 --> 04:01.530
Why did you even come?

04:01.532 --> 04:03.231
Because McKenzie invited me.

04:03.233 --> 04:05.567
No, no, no, I didn't.

04:05.569 --> 04:06.636
I asked Martin to come

04:06.638 --> 04:08.637
and he insisted
that you guys go.

04:08.639 --> 04:10.074
Well, the more the merrier,
right?

04:11.709 --> 04:14.076
But seriously,
how long do we have left?

04:14.078 --> 04:15.311
At least another three hours.

04:16.813 --> 04:18.146
Okay, shut up.

04:18.148 --> 04:20.916
I'm the one driving,
so just take a fucking nap.

04:20.918 --> 04:23.585
Well, I was excited
for the car ride.

04:23.587 --> 04:26.888
I really expected it
to be a bit more fun, you know?

04:26.890 --> 04:28.023
Drinking beers.

04:28.025 --> 04:30.326
Stopping off at old gas stations
where some old man works

04:30.328 --> 04:31.727
and is creepy to you girls,

04:31.729 --> 04:33.562
and Edgar would, like,
spit in his face.

04:33.564 --> 04:35.665
And he would follow us because
he'd know where we're going.

04:35.667 --> 04:36.766
Oh, my god, Gerrik.

04:36.768 --> 04:38.568
Do you hear yourself talk?

04:38.570 --> 04:40.569
And just so you know,
we are having fun, okay?

04:40.571 --> 04:42.304
Think about it this way,
we're going on a manhunt.

04:42.306 --> 04:44.674
I've never been on a manhunt,
so I'm really excited,

04:44.676 --> 04:45.878
because we are going
on a manhunt.

04:46.344 --> 04:47.876
Me, neither.

04:47.878 --> 04:49.978
It's like, uh,
the most dangerous game.

04:49.980 --> 04:51.114
- Mm.
- You know?

04:51.116 --> 04:53.148
Except for the fact that
we are trying to find Marylyn,

04:53.150 --> 04:54.249
and not kill her.

04:54.251 --> 04:56.651
Yeah, that's a big
difference there.

04:56.653 --> 04:59.689
Hey, do we know anything else
about this guy

04:59.691 --> 05:01.723
that we're supposed
to be meeting?

05:01.725 --> 05:03.792
Besides the fact
that this asshole

05:03.794 --> 05:06.227
is trying to ask for money
before he tells us what he knows

05:06.229 --> 05:07.929
about our missing sister?

05:07.931 --> 05:09.831
Yeah, fuck that guy.

05:09.833 --> 05:12.367
Okay, he's not asking for money.

05:12.369 --> 05:15.136
Well, then,
what is he asking for?

05:16.907 --> 05:18.307
I mean, I guess
we're gonna find out.

05:18.309 --> 05:21.212
He's the only one that responded
to the post. So...

05:22.379 --> 05:24.179
"Looking for sister,
Marylyn Cody,

05:24.181 --> 05:25.715
last seen headed
for Cinder Park,

05:25.717 --> 05:27.152
any information, please call."

05:28.152 --> 05:30.720
You posted this on Craigslist?

05:30.722 --> 05:32.088
Without any sexual
favors attached,

05:32.090 --> 05:34.323
and somebody actually responded?

05:34.325 --> 05:37.259
Yeah, I mean people always
respond to stuff on Craigslist

05:37.261 --> 05:38.393
if they know something.

05:38.395 --> 05:40.095
It's true.
It's how that guy in Germany

05:40.097 --> 05:41.797
found someone who would
let him eat him.

05:41.799 --> 05:44.400
Oh, god.
I forgot about that guy.

05:44.402 --> 05:46.167
Mm-mm. Armin Meiwes.

05:46.169 --> 05:47.335
His friends were probably like,

05:47.337 --> 05:48.937
"No one's gonna respond
to that."

05:48.939 --> 05:50.239
Well, he probably didn't have
any friends.

05:50.241 --> 05:51.374
But he did have faith.

05:51.376 --> 05:54.175
And so he posted
his cannibal ad on Craigslist.

05:54.177 --> 05:56.646
And then a week later,
he met that Danish guy...

05:56.648 --> 05:58.913
- Yep.
- he let him eat him.

05:58.915 --> 06:00.217
Sometimes you have
to have a little bit of hope.

06:01.686 --> 06:04.720
- Is that real?
- Real as shit, look it up.

06:04.722 --> 06:07.125
Oh, my god.
People are so fucked up.

06:08.426 --> 06:10.326
I gotta pee.

06:10.328 --> 06:11.863
- Seconded.
- And third.

06:12.729 --> 06:13.896
Fuck it.

06:13.898 --> 06:15.364
Anyone else want one?

06:15.366 --> 06:17.198
Oh, my god. Yes.
Thank you.

06:17.200 --> 06:19.001
Uh, uh, uh!

06:19.003 --> 06:21.771
Are bipolar people
allowed to drink?

06:21.773 --> 06:23.304
Come on, man.

06:23.306 --> 06:25.807
Yes, I can have a beer,
you dick.

06:26.744 --> 06:28.343
Just don't feed me
after midnight, though.

06:28.345 --> 06:30.011
That's the one thing.

06:30.013 --> 06:32.213
- I'm sorry, man.
- That's fine.

06:32.215 --> 06:33.016
It's just...

06:34.451 --> 06:37.352
you know, with the hospital stay
and all.

06:37.354 --> 06:41.756
Okay, guys, I'm fine.

06:41.758 --> 06:43.092
All right? The manic episode,

06:43.094 --> 06:45.360
as the doctors are calling it,
was due to stress.

06:45.362 --> 06:47.162
So all I have to do
is just take...

06:47.164 --> 06:50.035
Just take the shit they gave me
and take it easy.

06:51.469 --> 06:54.335
And honestly, this is like
the best thing for me.

06:54.337 --> 06:56.708
It's been way too long
since I've been camping.

06:58.075 --> 07:00.775
I, mean, shit I need this.

07:00.777 --> 07:02.381
Edgar's the best person
to have out here.

07:03.715 --> 07:04.614
It wasn't that long ago,

07:04.616 --> 07:06.418
he was guiding raft trips
in Colorado.

07:09.287 --> 07:11.920
Marylyn would always talk
about the shit you did.

07:11.922 --> 07:13.021
Said it was really dangerous.

07:13.023 --> 07:16.258
So, by her standard,
it must mean it was impressive.

07:17.261 --> 07:19.227
Marylyn
really said that about Edgar?

07:19.229 --> 07:20.732
Yes. She did.

07:21.833 --> 07:23.299
Fuck, man.

07:23.301 --> 07:25.134
- I'm impressed.
- Eh.

07:25.136 --> 07:27.371
Your older sister is one fine...

07:28.338 --> 07:29.771
independent woman.

07:29.773 --> 07:31.008
She must be found.

07:33.410 --> 07:35.845
- On that note, shall we?
- Yes.

07:39.249 --> 07:40.451
Come on, McKenzie.

07:58.436 --> 08:00.035
<i>Okay.</i>

08:00.037 --> 08:02.170
We must be close.

08:02.172 --> 08:05.176
Actually, I think we're here.

08:08.212 --> 08:09.377
Oh, shit.

08:09.379 --> 08:10.915
That place looks fucked.

08:12.482 --> 08:15.283
Okay, no.

08:15.285 --> 08:16.919
You just know
some old creepy guy

08:16.921 --> 08:19.088
with like half his teeth,
works in there.

08:19.090 --> 08:21.489
Yeah. Some like,
retired serial killer?

08:21.491 --> 08:23.424
Praying for a group of city folk
to travel through

08:23.426 --> 08:25.960
and fall into his web.

08:25.962 --> 08:28.396
You think there are
retired serial killers?

08:28.398 --> 08:29.864
Like the ones
who never get caught

08:29.866 --> 08:30.865
then get too old and give it up?

08:30.867 --> 08:34.336
Yeah. Yeah, just like
living normal lives now.

08:34.337 --> 08:36.505
Guaranteed our landlord
might be one.

08:36.506 --> 08:39.275
All right, who's coming in?

08:39.277 --> 08:41.208
I'm good.

08:41.211 --> 08:43.181
Yeah.
No, I think you guys got this.

08:47.484 --> 08:49.050
Why did we even bring
these pussies?

08:50.120 --> 08:51.523
Come on, I gotta pee.

09:00.598 --> 09:01.867
You got this, sis.

09:04.067 --> 09:06.937
Oh, this place
is fucking creepy.

09:31.561 --> 09:34.063
Maybe this guy really is
a retired serial killer.

09:34.065 --> 09:37.135
Ha. Shut the fuck up.
Don't say that.

09:38.201 --> 09:41.437
Cooks his victims into the food.

09:41.439 --> 09:42.671
Gross, Darcy.

09:42.673 --> 09:45.576
I'm just saying. Brace yourself
for something fucking weird.

09:51.114 --> 09:52.615
Hello?

09:52.617 --> 09:54.916
Jesus.

09:54.918 --> 09:56.420
Hi, there.

09:57.521 --> 09:59.188
- Jesus Christ.
- Holy hell.

09:59.190 --> 10:00.421
Holy Hell. You girls,

10:00.423 --> 10:01.957
you scared the living shit
out of me.

10:01.959 --> 10:03.358
Oh, yeah?
We scared the hell out of you?

10:03.360 --> 10:05.961
You were the one that just
crept up behind us, and...

10:05.963 --> 10:07.029
- Who does that?
- I said...

10:07.031 --> 10:07.997
I said hello.

10:07.999 --> 10:09.330
Yeah, but can you do it
before you're like,

10:09.332 --> 10:10.598
two feet behind us?

10:10.600 --> 10:12.400
I'm so sorry,
I was out in the back

10:12.402 --> 10:13.968
fixing the dishwasher.

10:13.970 --> 10:15.503
Didn't hear you come in
till the bell rang.

10:15.505 --> 10:17.906
Yeah, well the guys
are probably freaking out now.

10:17.908 --> 10:19.241
Tell me about it.

10:19.243 --> 10:20.541
Well, I have to use
the bathroom,

10:20.543 --> 10:23.078
so could you please tell me
where that is?

10:23.080 --> 10:24.579
But I don't want
to leave you here, though.

10:24.581 --> 10:25.948
It's fine.

10:25.950 --> 10:27.482
Are you sure?

10:27.484 --> 10:29.017
Yeah, Darcy it's fine.

10:29.019 --> 10:30.287
The bathroom is out,
on the side.

10:31.555 --> 10:32.621
Thank you.

10:32.623 --> 10:34.025
Sorry for freaking you out.

10:38.396 --> 10:40.996
Hi, I'm looking for a man
named Leonard.

10:40.998 --> 10:42.197
Is he here?

10:42.199 --> 10:44.266
Yeah, that's me. Leon.

10:44.268 --> 10:47.269
Oh, okay. Well, I'm McKenzie.

10:47.271 --> 10:48.940
- We spoke online...
- You're Marylyn's sister.

10:49.639 --> 10:50.939
Yes.

10:50.941 --> 10:52.006
Do you know...

10:52.008 --> 10:53.708
Do you know where she is?

11:00.417 --> 11:02.684
Now these,
these are heart rate monitors.

11:02.686 --> 11:04.453
They go on your wrist,
easy-peasy.

11:04.455 --> 11:08.323
Uh, this cell phone,
it's tweaked to work in there.

11:08.325 --> 11:10.391
Now, I usually get
a deposit for this stuff,

11:10.393 --> 11:11.526
most of it's expensive.

11:11.528 --> 11:12.663
Especially these.

11:15.499 --> 11:17.366
Each of you, you drink
one of these before you go in.

11:17.368 --> 11:18.534
Not after.

11:18.536 --> 11:19.734
Now, it doesn't taste great.

11:19.736 --> 11:21.337
But it keeps them
from talking to you.

11:21.339 --> 11:23.671
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Just slow down.

11:23.673 --> 11:26.742
I don't know
if I need any of this,

11:26.744 --> 11:29.078
whatever this shit is.

11:29.080 --> 11:30.482
All I wanna do
is find my sister.

11:32.082 --> 11:34.585
Okay, so I know
that she is in, um...

11:35.686 --> 11:37.285
Cinder Park.

11:37.287 --> 11:39.288
If she is in Cinder...

11:39.290 --> 11:41.022
Cinder Park.

11:41.024 --> 11:43.391
I just don't know whether
she's in the rolling hills,

11:43.393 --> 11:45.626
or the falls,
or if there's another place

11:45.628 --> 11:46.694
that I don't even...

11:46.696 --> 11:47.997
- What the fuck?
- That map's

11:47.999 --> 11:49.064
not going to do you any good.

11:49.066 --> 11:50.100
You're gonna need this.

11:54.604 --> 11:56.137
Okay, but she's in Cinder Park.

11:56.139 --> 11:57.405
That's, that's where we need
to go.

11:57.407 --> 11:58.473
No.

11:58.475 --> 12:00.675
The signs might say Cinder Park,

12:00.677 --> 12:02.013
but that's not where
you're going.

12:03.614 --> 12:06.151
Okay, I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

12:08.385 --> 12:09.386
You don't know?

12:10.720 --> 12:12.320
What exactly did your sister
tell you

12:12.322 --> 12:13.725
about what she was looking for
out here?

12:16.224 --> 12:17.261
She didn't tell me shit,
but, um...

12:21.197 --> 12:22.199
...this did.

12:23.033 --> 12:24.168
You stole her journal?

12:24.667 --> 12:25.669
Yeah.

12:27.138 --> 12:29.438
It's a sisters thing.
You wouldn't understand.

12:29.440 --> 12:30.709
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

12:32.442 --> 12:34.309
Okay, so she keeps mentioning

12:34.311 --> 12:38.046
this secret passageway
in the forest,

12:38.048 --> 12:40.049
but she never says
where it goes or anything else,

12:40.051 --> 12:41.319
and it really doesn't make
any sense.

12:42.085 --> 12:42.952
Uh...

12:42.954 --> 12:44.752
She also keeps mentioning
this place

12:44.754 --> 12:47.522
which I can't find
on any of the maps.

12:47.524 --> 12:49.593
Um, I think it's called...

12:50.460 --> 12:51.528
The Axiom.

12:52.763 --> 12:54.128
Yeah.

12:54.130 --> 12:57.565
Wow. Your sister's
truly amazing.

12:57.567 --> 12:59.303
How she learned all this,
I'll never know.

13:02.639 --> 13:04.241
Well, in these pages...

13:06.676 --> 13:10.679
She talks a lot about
how the forest is dangerous.

13:10.681 --> 13:14.282
And how a lot of people
are known to have disappeared.

13:14.284 --> 13:16.751
It's dangerous if you're stupid.

13:16.753 --> 13:18.252
It's dangerous
if you don't listen to people

13:18.254 --> 13:19.523
who are trying to help you.

13:20.691 --> 13:22.524
Cinder Park.

13:22.526 --> 13:25.093
You follow this path.

13:25.095 --> 13:26.594
The passageway,
the door that your sister

13:26.596 --> 13:27.631
writes about in here.

13:28.599 --> 13:29.600
It's real.

13:30.367 --> 13:31.369
It's right here.

13:34.205 --> 13:38.107
And what's so special about
this passageway, this path?

13:38.109 --> 13:39.109
Where does it go?

13:40.244 --> 13:42.211
I thought you'd never ask.

13:42.213 --> 13:44.813
Please, just promise me
you won't say anything.

13:44.815 --> 13:46.814
I can't believe you told Edgar
and not me.

13:46.816 --> 13:47.782
Oh, my god.

13:47.784 --> 13:49.650
Come on, as her brother
and his best friend,

13:49.652 --> 13:50.718
I need to know these things.

13:50.720 --> 13:52.621
You're not his best friend.

13:52.623 --> 13:54.758
We're all best friends, equally.

13:56.460 --> 13:57.892
Who the hell's gonna be
your best man?

13:57.894 --> 14:00.161
Just both of you,
shut up, please?

14:00.163 --> 14:01.665
She doesn't want
to tell anybody yet.

14:02.666 --> 14:03.866
Oh, here she comes.

14:03.868 --> 14:05.070
Shut up, shut up.

14:09.874 --> 14:12.406
Classy.
And that's your future wife.

14:12.408 --> 14:14.376
Goddamn right, it is.

14:14.378 --> 14:16.211
McKenzie's still in there?

14:16.213 --> 14:17.445
Yeah, she is.

14:17.447 --> 14:18.646
She's been in there for a while.

14:18.648 --> 14:19.650
You should go check on her.

14:20.283 --> 14:21.583
Can't you?

14:21.585 --> 14:23.385
We talked about this.

14:23.387 --> 14:26.354
Uh-oh, is there some trouble
in the Cody family

14:26.356 --> 14:27.923
we aren't aware of?

14:27.925 --> 14:29.625
- Sibling quarrels?
- No.

14:29.627 --> 14:31.293
No, we're fine.

14:31.295 --> 14:33.795
They're definitely not fine.

14:33.797 --> 14:37.933
I told McKenzie about Darcy
and I moving to Clayton

14:37.935 --> 14:39.267
just before we left.

14:39.269 --> 14:40.769
So...

14:40.771 --> 14:42.838
So, what, it's like 20 miles
out from town?

14:42.840 --> 14:44.772
Exactly, but, I mean,
you know McKenzie.

14:44.774 --> 14:48.410
She, she wants the family
to be around like, all the time.

14:48.412 --> 14:50.578
It's like... It's a bit much.

14:50.580 --> 14:51.914
She just loves you.

14:51.916 --> 14:53.551
She wants to be around you.

14:54.685 --> 14:56.318
- It's not nuts.
- Oh, now, we know

14:56.320 --> 14:58.587
why you're hunting
so hard for Marylyn.

14:58.589 --> 15:00.358
She's cutting her losses
with you.

15:01.892 --> 15:03.695
I'm perfectly okay with that.

15:04.662 --> 15:06.495
You're her big brother.

15:06.497 --> 15:07.532
That means something.

15:08.766 --> 15:09.767
Huh.

15:14.205 --> 15:17.142
Uh, come on, please? For me?

15:18.274 --> 15:20.375
God.

15:20.377 --> 15:21.309
I'll do really naughty things

15:21.311 --> 15:23.281
- to you later.
- Hey, I'll be right back.

15:25.816 --> 15:27.248
Goddamn it.

15:27.250 --> 15:28.385
Winner.

15:49.373 --> 15:50.608
That's what I thought.

15:52.942 --> 15:54.008
You're a fucking liar.

15:54.010 --> 15:55.810
- I'm not lying.
- It's not possible.

15:55.812 --> 15:57.779
Look, I know it's hard
to take at first.

15:57.781 --> 15:59.747
You've just gotta try
and keep an open mind.

16:02.619 --> 16:05.286
I just don't get why you're
fucking with me right now.

16:05.288 --> 16:06.887
Oh, look, sweetheart,
I don't give a damn

16:06.889 --> 16:07.856
if you don't believe me.

16:07.858 --> 16:10.559
You'll see.
You go there, you'll feel it.

16:10.561 --> 16:11.593
It's warm.

16:11.595 --> 16:13.929
The closer you get,
you can feel it vibrating.

16:13.931 --> 16:15.997
Like there's loud music
coming from the other side.

16:15.999 --> 16:17.933
That's how you'll know
where it is.

16:17.935 --> 16:20.301
So you listen to me.

16:20.303 --> 16:22.871
You take this stuff
and you put it

16:22.873 --> 16:24.676
into your little backpack here.

16:33.883 --> 16:34.885
Hello, there.

16:36.586 --> 16:38.322
- You okay?
- Yeah.

16:40.891 --> 16:42.056
I'm Martin.

16:42.058 --> 16:43.891
Martin. I'm Leon.

16:43.893 --> 16:44.959
Nice to meet you.

16:44.961 --> 16:46.461
You know where our sister is?

16:46.463 --> 16:47.429
I surely do.

16:47.431 --> 16:49.631
I've was just telling
your McKenzie here.

16:49.633 --> 16:51.599
See, you follow the path.
In the center of the forest,

16:51.601 --> 16:53.801
there's a group
of traveler outposts.

16:53.803 --> 16:55.273
She should be
around there somewhere.

16:57.307 --> 16:59.308
Okay. Thanks, man.

16:59.310 --> 17:00.675
If there is anything we can do
for your help...

17:00.677 --> 17:03.444
Why, thank you, Martin.
Actually, there is.

17:03.446 --> 17:05.347
You see,
last time I was at Cinder,

17:05.348 --> 17:07.616
my wife, well,
she lost something.

17:07.617 --> 17:11.520
A necklace that I'd, well,
she'd really like it back, and,

17:11.521 --> 17:13.457
here, you take this.

17:15.090 --> 17:16.892
Pretty, isn't she?

17:16.894 --> 17:18.527
Now, you see that necklace?

17:18.529 --> 17:20.395
Now, that should be around
that traveler's outpost.

17:20.396 --> 17:21.933
You know, lost items
usually end up there.

17:23.900 --> 17:26.001
Why haven't you just gone in
and gotten it?

17:26.002 --> 17:27.734
You kidding?
Got a business to run.

17:27.737 --> 17:30.405
As you can see, it's in
a desperate need of attention.

17:30.407 --> 17:32.941
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

17:32.943 --> 17:35.010
Well, we'll keep an eye out
for it.

17:35.012 --> 17:37.979
You know, I would truly
appreciate that.

17:37.981 --> 17:40.048
Oh, the park is technically
closed this time of year,

17:40.050 --> 17:41.515
but I know the ranger.

17:41.517 --> 17:43.719
Yeah, you pop that
on your windshield,

17:43.721 --> 17:44.722
no one will bother you.

17:46.023 --> 17:48.056
Cool. Thanks, man.
I appreciate it.

17:48.058 --> 17:49.761
You know,
I greatly admire Marylyn.

17:50.994 --> 17:52.397
I do hope she's okay.

17:55.765 --> 17:57.467
Hey, you watch out
for that sister, huh?

18:04.875 --> 18:06.344
Good luck.

18:10.513 --> 18:11.616
Is everything okay?

18:12.616 --> 18:13.882
What'd they say?

18:13.884 --> 18:15.787
McKenzie, you all right?

18:16.919 --> 18:18.386
That was weird.

18:18.388 --> 18:20.023
Why would Marylyn
ever go see that guy?

18:21.625 --> 18:22.794
Because the park's closed.

18:24.727 --> 18:26.029
And now we can get in.

18:33.070 --> 18:34.735
All right.

18:34.737 --> 18:35.972
Let's go find Marylyn.

18:49.119 --> 18:51.019
Ugh, I just lost service.

18:51.021 --> 18:53.424
Aw, what are your
12 followers gonna do?

18:55.058 --> 18:56.728
Oh, I just lost service, too.

18:57.628 --> 18:59.661
If the park was closed,

18:59.663 --> 19:03.831
why would Marylyn ever go
to this traveler's outpost?

19:03.833 --> 19:05.802
What do you think
she was looking for out there?

19:06.837 --> 19:07.839
I don't know.

19:11.140 --> 19:12.840
Definitely have to camp there.

19:12.842 --> 19:14.876
The sun is going down.

19:14.878 --> 19:17.080
Guys, I'm afraid we are setting
these tents up in the dark.

19:36.632 --> 19:38.802
<i>Gerrik, I'm gonna
fuck you in your tent tonight.</i>

19:40.971 --> 19:42.904
<i>Welcome to Cinder Park.</i>

19:42.906 --> 19:44.205
We're here, baby.

19:44.207 --> 19:46.640
I can't wait to get out
of this fucking car.

20:06.530 --> 20:07.896
- You gotta pee?
- Mm-hm.

20:07.898 --> 20:09.563
Oh, I gotta pee.

20:09.565 --> 20:11.966
We're not gonna
get in trouble for this, are we?

20:11.968 --> 20:14.536
I'm really scared
of the law services out here.

20:14.538 --> 20:15.703
Gerrik, calm down.

20:15.705 --> 20:17.038
You're not that important.

20:17.040 --> 20:18.572
Did you know
there's, uh,

20:18.574 --> 20:20.908
there's a new species of frogs
in this area?

20:20.910 --> 20:22.610
- Frog?
- Yeah.

20:48.170 --> 20:49.974
"Cinder Creek
Traveler's Outpost."

20:50.807 --> 20:51.809
To the right.

21:12.161 --> 21:13.563
What the fuck
is she doing?

21:16.032 --> 21:17.635
McKenzie, the trail
is right here.

21:19.703 --> 21:21.539
Kenz, what's up?

21:28.946 --> 21:29.946
Hey, Gerrik.

21:30.914 --> 21:31.916
Come here.

21:35.886 --> 21:37.555
- You wanna help me?
- Yeah.

21:39.156 --> 21:40.691
Okay, come here.

21:41.891 --> 21:45.696
I need you to walk
in that direction...

21:46.696 --> 21:47.798
for 20 feet.

21:48.698 --> 21:49.734
Can you do that?

21:50.634 --> 21:51.899
Yeah, but why can't we...

21:51.901 --> 21:54.205
- Can you?
- Yeah, obviously.

21:54.937 --> 21:56.040
Okay.

21:56.907 --> 21:58.239
Go.

22:07.618 --> 22:08.919
All right, McKenzie.

22:09.753 --> 22:11.155
I'm walking.

22:11.821 --> 22:13.023
I'm walking.

22:14.291 --> 22:15.659
Is this far enough?

22:26.369 --> 22:28.069
Good one, guys.

22:28.071 --> 22:30.338
The old leave
while my back's turned trick.

22:30.340 --> 22:32.109
You guys are hilarious.

23:05.841 --> 23:07.809
Are you really that high, still?

23:07.811 --> 23:09.344
Dude, such a fucker.

23:09.346 --> 23:10.648
Goober.

23:11.947 --> 23:13.383
All right, let's go.

23:22.059 --> 23:24.192
I definitely think
he's had sex with a girl before,

23:24.194 --> 23:25.694
it's just been
a really long time.

23:25.696 --> 23:26.731
- Gerrik?
- Yeah.

23:27.263 --> 23:28.264
There's no way.

23:29.465 --> 23:31.002
What the fuck?

23:33.169 --> 23:36.407
It's too warm out,
I'm not walking another step.

23:38.274 --> 23:39.342
I think
they're stopping.

23:42.745 --> 23:44.378
- Come on, man.
- No, fuck you, Martin.

23:44.380 --> 23:48.148
You never said this had
so much hiking involved.

23:48.150 --> 23:49.850
Come on man, let's just
set him down for a minute.

23:49.852 --> 23:51.720
Have you got any more weed left?

23:51.722 --> 23:54.422
Uh-uh. No, we'll play
a little game.

23:54.424 --> 23:57.762
It's called you get to the tent
and we can smoke this joint.

23:58.328 --> 23:59.864
Fucking wanker.

24:07.771 --> 24:12.272
So, I just had a great idea on
how I can just get my green card

24:12.274 --> 24:14.778
and my days at Days Inn will be
a thing of the past.

24:17.848 --> 24:19.347
Oh, my god. Really?

24:19.349 --> 24:20.415
What?

24:20.417 --> 24:23.050
You saw the way she was touching
my arm back there.

24:23.052 --> 24:24.752
Uh-huh.

24:24.754 --> 24:26.090
Come on, man. What do you say?

24:27.858 --> 24:28.923
Dual wedding?

24:28.925 --> 24:30.325
We'll be each other's best man.

24:30.327 --> 24:32.359
I'm gonna pretend
like I didn't hear this.

24:32.361 --> 24:34.064
We don't have
all day, come on.

24:35.398 --> 24:37.234
You gonna let
a bunch of girls beat you?

24:38.234 --> 24:39.369
I'll beat you up the mountain.

24:40.936 --> 24:42.803
All right, go on.

24:42.805 --> 24:44.841
Just saying, this is why
you're not getting laid.

24:46.376 --> 24:47.378
Whoa.

24:48.177 --> 24:49.179
Harsh.

24:50.446 --> 24:51.982
I'm sweating.

24:53.949 --> 24:55.753
And the sun's still out.
How is that possible?

24:56.953 --> 24:58.552
It's almost nine.

24:58.554 --> 25:01.091
Sun might set a little later
this far north.

25:02.324 --> 25:03.326
Still...

25:04.127 --> 25:05.763
it's really bright out.

25:07.464 --> 25:10.231
Uh, so...

25:10.233 --> 25:12.168
Darcy and McKenzie.
Do they ever hang out?

25:13.102 --> 25:14.434
No, not really.

25:14.436 --> 25:16.870
Darcy's got her friends
from work.

25:16.872 --> 25:20.207
And McKenzie, she's got...

25:20.209 --> 25:21.811
You.

25:22.946 --> 25:24.281
Does McKenzie have a boyfriend?

25:26.015 --> 25:29.349
I don't think so. I don't know.

25:29.351 --> 25:32.921
Dude, you don't know if your
own sister has a boyfriend?

25:32.923 --> 25:34.992
Don't worry, we can fix that.

25:40.062 --> 25:42.129
She is definitely
more high strung than usual,

25:42.131 --> 25:43.565
and, honestly...

25:43.567 --> 25:44.902
...I'm into it.

25:48.304 --> 25:49.904
I love your sister, man.

25:49.906 --> 25:51.472
I love her shorts.

25:51.474 --> 25:53.878
She's clearly wanting
a bit of British penis.

25:54.578 --> 25:55.812
Come on!

26:01.551 --> 26:02.552
Guys.

26:05.120 --> 26:06.157
Edgar?

26:08.524 --> 26:09.826
What's going on, man?

26:10.526 --> 26:11.561
You don't see her?

26:14.330 --> 26:15.432
See who?

26:16.600 --> 26:18.569
The girl she's...
she's right here.

26:20.936 --> 26:22.339
You're freaking G out, man.

26:24.107 --> 26:25.373
You okay, man?

26:30.146 --> 26:31.315
You all right, man?

26:39.923 --> 26:41.090
Yeah, I'm fine.

26:53.136 --> 26:54.205
What did you say?

26:55.671 --> 26:57.271
I didn't say anything.

26:57.273 --> 26:59.574
What the fuck did you say?

26:59.576 --> 27:01.545
Are you sure
you should take that many?

27:03.079 --> 27:05.312
Yeah, I'm fine.

27:05.314 --> 27:06.316
I'm okay.

27:08.984 --> 27:11.222
Guys, I'm fine.

27:12.522 --> 27:14.187
All right, man.

27:14.189 --> 27:15.458
I'm fine. Come on. Let's...

27:16.292 --> 27:17.328
Let's just go.

27:31.140 --> 27:33.241
Come on, bitch.

27:33.243 --> 27:34.912
I'm coming.

27:36.012 --> 27:37.147
The sun's still out.

27:39.215 --> 27:42.253
Yeah, it is pretty strange.

27:44.020 --> 27:45.122
It's getting late.

27:50.994 --> 27:53.161
This is nice.

27:53.163 --> 27:56.396
You know, the city can get so...
I don't know.

27:56.398 --> 27:57.531
Rushed.

27:57.533 --> 27:58.601
But this is...

28:00.203 --> 28:01.205
beautiful.

28:02.504 --> 28:04.073
Peaceful, you know?

28:07.209 --> 28:09.245
Clayton's not going
to be much better, you know?

28:12.215 --> 28:13.350
I'm just saying.

28:14.650 --> 28:15.686
Yeah.

28:17.119 --> 28:18.353
Martin said
you were pretty upset

28:18.355 --> 28:19.523
when he told you
we were leaving.

28:20.590 --> 28:24.194
I'm not upset, I just know him.

28:25.528 --> 28:27.064
We won't ever see him around.

28:28.764 --> 28:29.731
It's fine, though.

28:29.733 --> 28:31.331
I mean, once we get Marylyn
back at home,

28:31.333 --> 28:32.535
he can do whatever he wants.

28:39.376 --> 28:41.078
You two moving in together,
though.

28:42.445 --> 28:43.981
Seems pretty serious.

28:44.680 --> 28:46.079
Yeah, it is.

28:46.081 --> 28:48.616
Well, which is why
I'd really like it

28:48.618 --> 28:50.018
if you and I
could maybe spend some...

28:50.020 --> 28:51.055
Is that it?

28:53.089 --> 28:54.425
Yeah, looks like it.

28:58.160 --> 28:59.196
Looks like we found it.

29:02.264 --> 29:05.369
- Where's Gerrik?
- Um, he's coming.

29:30.659 --> 29:31.728
Marylyn!

29:35.330 --> 29:36.664
Marylyn!

29:38.400 --> 29:40.167
You see anybody in there?

29:40.169 --> 29:42.638
Nah, man. This place looks like
it hasn't been used in years.

29:49.212 --> 29:50.677
I don't know,
McKenzie, this is your thing.

29:50.679 --> 29:51.681
What do you want to do?

29:56.285 --> 29:57.417
Well, there's
two other buildings,

29:57.419 --> 29:59.220
one there and one there.

29:59.222 --> 30:00.521
Martin, check one.
Edgar, check the other.

30:00.523 --> 30:01.558
And we'll try to get in here.

30:09.498 --> 30:11.267
Okay, how do we do this?

30:24.813 --> 30:26.115
Marylyn!

30:38.695 --> 30:40.297
I'll check this one down here.

30:48.303 --> 30:49.473
It's locked.

31:20.802 --> 31:22.235
Huh.

31:22.237 --> 31:23.171
Look who made it.

31:23.173 --> 31:26.273
That is the last time
I'm going anywhere

31:26.275 --> 31:29.510
with you or your sister.

31:29.512 --> 31:31.578
How's that cigarette
treating you at this altitude?

31:31.580 --> 31:33.813
It's delicious.

31:33.815 --> 31:35.852
Come on, let's go see
if the girls found anything.

31:37.821 --> 31:40.221
Have you guys noticed
that the sun is not going down?

31:40.223 --> 31:42.459
It's just kind of moving around?

31:55.905 --> 31:57.441
Everything's locked up tight.

31:57.940 --> 31:58.741
Now what?

32:00.475 --> 32:01.742
You know what?
We should look around

32:01.744 --> 32:03.243
while it's still light out.

32:03.245 --> 32:04.311
Search for clues.

32:04.313 --> 32:05.349
Scooby Doo style.

32:06.616 --> 32:09.617
All right, Daphne.
You go search for clues.

32:09.619 --> 32:10.786
I'm gonna set up my tent.

32:15.524 --> 32:17.692
All right, I'll check
the surrounding area.

32:17.694 --> 32:20.397
You know, maybe Marylyn
set up her camp somewhere.

32:27.669 --> 32:28.906
Wait somebody's stuff
is in here.

32:29.638 --> 32:30.706
You know what,

32:32.308 --> 32:33.808
I got some eyeglass tools
in my pack,

32:33.810 --> 32:35.675
that we could use
to get the lock open.

32:35.677 --> 32:37.877
Or maybe there's like,
a side window

32:37.879 --> 32:40.484
or something that has a screen
we can pop out.

32:42.284 --> 32:43.751
Maybe we should try a back door?

32:43.753 --> 32:45.418
I feel like this place
have a back door, right?

32:45.420 --> 32:47.655
Fuck, Kenz!

32:47.657 --> 32:49.757
Oh, my god!

32:49.759 --> 32:51.962
I am so attracted
to you right now.

33:08.677 --> 33:10.379
Martin's totally gonna want
to see this.

33:17.587 --> 33:21.321
Damn it! It's empty.

33:21.323 --> 33:23.726
I mean, but it could be
her's, though, I don't know.

33:25.427 --> 33:26.429
Look at this.

33:27.296 --> 33:29.562
What is it?

33:29.564 --> 33:31.831
It's a ledger for
everybody who's ever been here.

33:31.833 --> 33:33.634
A clue.

33:33.636 --> 33:35.772
Okay, well, do you see
Marylyn's name?

33:37.407 --> 33:38.407
Marylyn!

33:40.776 --> 33:41.811
Marylyn?

33:44.880 --> 33:46.681
All right, if you don't come out
in the next minute,

33:46.683 --> 33:48.348
I'm gonna be forced
to tell McKenzie

33:48.350 --> 33:51.287
about the time you had sex
with Aaron Dorsey on her bed.

33:53.423 --> 33:55.690
Yeah, you're not out here,
are you?

33:55.692 --> 33:57.928
I'm the only one out here,
talking to myself.

34:03.332 --> 34:04.964
Yeah, this is great.

34:07.536 --> 34:08.668
- Boo!
- Jesus!

34:10.339 --> 34:11.404
Where is everybody?

34:11.406 --> 34:12.706
Oh! We got into the outpost.

34:12.708 --> 34:13.842
You should have seen McKenzie,

34:13.844 --> 34:16.444
she broke down the door,
she's like, like Jack Nicholson

34:16.446 --> 34:18.045
when he swings that axe
in <i>The Shining.</i>

34:18.047 --> 34:20.681
Caretaker's chest. Aah!

34:20.683 --> 34:22.049
Oh, it was so badass.

34:22.051 --> 34:24.518
You are a dork.

34:24.520 --> 34:26.520
- Yeah, and?
- Come on we should head back.

34:26.522 --> 34:28.723
No, I think that Scooby Doo
and the rest of the gang

34:28.725 --> 34:30.991
will be okay without Fred
and Daphne for a while.

34:30.993 --> 34:32.726
Oh, we're Fred and Daphne now?

34:32.728 --> 34:35.128
Duh! Daphne was fucking hot.

34:35.130 --> 34:38.666
Goddamn, she was.

34:38.668 --> 34:41.034
But Fred, he was...
he was kind of a tool, though?

34:41.036 --> 34:42.837
No, he wasn't.
He had that cute ascot.

34:42.839 --> 34:43.904
Uh-huh.

34:43.906 --> 34:44.975
Come on, we should head back.

34:46.042 --> 34:49.543
I mean, we could keep looking

34:49.545 --> 34:51.514
out here
for a little lot longer.

34:54.150 --> 34:55.916
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.

34:57.719 --> 34:59.987
Maybe we should keep searching.

34:59.989 --> 35:04.425
I mean, there's so much ground
to cover.

35:04.427 --> 35:05.429
Mm.

35:10.433 --> 35:12.733
Jesus. There's a lot
of people here.

35:12.735 --> 35:14.471
Check to see who was the last
to sign it.

35:16.572 --> 35:18.538
Gregory and Allison Scott.

35:18.540 --> 35:19.842
1957.

35:24.080 --> 35:25.581
This place is weird.

35:27.884 --> 35:29.886
I mean this box,
all these papers.

35:30.953 --> 35:33.556
Everything's dated back to 1957.

35:35.190 --> 35:36.459
These photos.

35:48.203 --> 35:49.538
Where did you get that?

35:52.607 --> 35:54.442
The guy from the restaurant
gave it to me.

35:54.444 --> 35:56.413
He said his wife lost
a necklace here or something.

36:02.217 --> 36:03.453
What?

36:05.688 --> 36:06.757
I saw her.

36:18.100 --> 36:19.636
I love you, baby.

36:43.625 --> 36:45.161
God,
you are so beautiful.

36:56.973 --> 36:58.572
What's wrong? What's wrong?

36:59.641 --> 37:00.643
What's wrong?

37:01.511 --> 37:02.612
Nothing.

37:05.214 --> 37:06.215
I'm okay.

37:11.821 --> 37:13.119
You know,
we've been gone a long time.

37:13.121 --> 37:14.123
We should get back.

37:18.594 --> 37:20.159
What do you mean you think
you saw her?

37:20.161 --> 37:21.531
I saw...

37:27.536 --> 37:28.938
I don't know what I saw.
Never mind.

37:30.605 --> 37:31.640
Nothing.

37:49.692 --> 37:50.791
Hey, Edgar?

37:50.793 --> 37:51.795
Mm-hm.

37:53.929 --> 37:56.195
Do you still have your tools?

37:56.197 --> 37:58.601
Because I want to open
that box over there.

38:00.069 --> 38:01.071
Yeah.

38:02.003 --> 38:03.570
Look, I'm just very aware

38:03.572 --> 38:05.905
of all the breaking and entering
that we're doing.

38:05.907 --> 38:07.574
I mean, somebody owns
this place.

38:07.576 --> 38:10.610
Yeah, and that somebody
will understand.

38:10.612 --> 38:12.114
Or do I have to go get
the axe again?

38:17.219 --> 38:18.184
In case you're wondering,

38:18.186 --> 38:20.924
the sun is still out,
and it's almost 11.

39:01.263 --> 39:03.063
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:03.065 --> 39:04.833
Did you guys find anything?

39:05.735 --> 39:06.800
No.

39:06.802 --> 39:08.302
Were you even looking?

39:08.304 --> 39:10.137
Yes, dick.

39:10.139 --> 39:12.338
We were doing something,

39:12.340 --> 39:13.944
other than
just fucking sitting there.

39:17.145 --> 39:18.645
Cut off their heads.

39:18.647 --> 39:20.380
I told them
to cut off their heads.

39:20.382 --> 39:21.849
But they didn't listen.

39:21.851 --> 39:23.183
And now, look what happened!

39:24.719 --> 39:26.355
Is anyone worried about the sun?

39:28.991 --> 39:30.324
It's almost midnight.

39:30.326 --> 39:32.425
What the fuck is going on?

39:32.427 --> 39:33.694
Where's McKenzie?

39:33.696 --> 39:36.029
She's, uh,
up there in the outpost.

39:55.384 --> 39:56.449
What happened?

39:56.451 --> 39:58.020
- Huh?
- You okay?

40:00.755 --> 40:02.121
Sorry.

40:02.123 --> 40:04.123
I thought I saw a rat
or something.

40:04.125 --> 40:05.192
Okay.

40:05.194 --> 40:06.126
I don't get it.

40:06.128 --> 40:07.860
Why did Marylyn would
ever come in here?

40:07.862 --> 40:08.964
I mean, look at this place.

40:11.366 --> 40:13.936
Well, she might, if there was
a storm or something.

40:16.105 --> 40:17.170
I guess.

40:17.172 --> 40:18.471
Edgar, did you bring your tools,

40:18.473 --> 40:20.340
'cause I really want
to open this box.

40:20.342 --> 40:22.076
Why?

40:22.078 --> 40:23.710
Because, Gerrik,
it's the last place

40:23.712 --> 40:25.179
I haven't checked
and I want to look.

40:25.181 --> 40:27.447
All right, Lizzy Borden,
want to open up another one?

40:27.449 --> 40:28.715
No.

40:28.717 --> 40:30.150
No, it's just a simple lock.

40:30.152 --> 40:32.322
Here. Look, we don't need
to tear anything up.

40:35.891 --> 40:36.893
Grab that one.

40:38.293 --> 40:39.362
No, the other one.

40:42.364 --> 40:43.400
All right.

40:47.069 --> 40:48.170
- What?
- Uh...

40:48.871 --> 40:50.404
It just, uh...

40:50.406 --> 40:51.838
It reminds me
of that one Christmas

40:51.840 --> 40:53.440
when we were kids.

40:53.442 --> 40:55.241
When we broke into Mom
and Dad's closet

40:55.243 --> 40:56.976
and saw all
our Christmas presents?

40:56.978 --> 40:59.980
Yeah, fuck.

40:59.982 --> 41:02.116
It's less gratifying
when find all your presents

41:02.118 --> 41:04.050
unwrapped like that at once.

41:04.052 --> 41:08.058
Yup, had to fake surprise
the entire next morning.

41:10.960 --> 41:12.159
Oh, my god. And we had to act

41:12.161 --> 41:13.897
like we didn't find
Mom's vibrator.

41:16.431 --> 41:17.833
Uh, do you...

41:18.868 --> 41:21.835
All right, um, hold your steady.

41:21.837 --> 41:23.206
There's no way this works.

41:24.139 --> 41:26.172
One...

41:26.174 --> 41:27.776
two, three.

41:29.478 --> 41:31.815
It worked. You did it.

41:33.516 --> 41:36.016
Where the hell
did you learn how to do that?

41:36.018 --> 41:37.518
- That?
- Hm.

41:37.520 --> 41:38.788
Wouldn't you like
to know?

41:57.572 --> 41:58.775
Is that...

41:59.507 --> 42:00.773
Yeah.

42:00.775 --> 42:03.011
You guys, when we were at the
restaurant, that guy, Leon...

42:04.279 --> 42:06.079
he showed us this picture
of his wife.

42:06.081 --> 42:07.848
Said he... She's missing
a necklace.

42:07.850 --> 42:08.918
That's the necklace.

42:10.386 --> 42:11.487
You all should see this.

42:18.326 --> 42:19.828
What the fuck?

42:32.241 --> 42:34.340
What is that red line?

42:34.342 --> 42:40.313
Look, I'm no expert,
but that looks a lot like...

42:40.315 --> 42:41.350
Blood?

42:50.458 --> 42:51.960
I'm gonna go get some water.

42:53.094 --> 42:54.129
Are you okay?

42:56.031 --> 42:58.902
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm dehydrated.

43:00.969 --> 43:02.469
Maybe we shouldn't have
brought him on this trip.

43:02.471 --> 43:04.237
This is a little too much.

43:18.487 --> 43:21.188
Yeah, I'll go get him.

43:21.190 --> 43:22.192
We'll build a fire.

43:23.157 --> 43:24.324
Do you have any matches?

43:24.326 --> 43:25.328
Yeah, they're in my bag.

43:29.632 --> 43:31.100
Hey, have you guys, um...

43:33.002 --> 43:34.934
Have you guys seen
anything weird?

43:34.936 --> 43:36.503
Besides this creepy outpost

43:36.505 --> 43:38.404
with a backyard full of chains
and blood, no.

43:38.406 --> 43:39.408
This is all normal.

44:26.956 --> 44:28.224
Martin, what the fuck
are you doing?

44:31.627 --> 44:33.128
He's grabbing
the matches from my....

44:34.228 --> 44:35.297
Fuck.

44:42.503 --> 44:44.471
- What is this?
- What do you mean?

44:44.473 --> 44:47.674
What the fuck is this, McKenzie?

44:47.676 --> 44:50.444
The guy at the restaurant.
He gave you this shit?

44:50.446 --> 44:52.545
It's nothing, Martin.
It's just stupid...

44:52.547 --> 44:53.582
No!

44:54.583 --> 44:57.116
No! Martin!

44:57.118 --> 44:59.018
You don't understand.
We need those!

44:59.020 --> 45:00.587
Martin, what's wrong?

45:00.589 --> 45:02.655
She tore out the pages
to Marylyn's journal.

45:02.657 --> 45:04.991
She didn't want us to see this.

45:04.993 --> 45:07.126
There's something dangerous
in these woods.

45:07.128 --> 45:08.364
Uh, what do you mean?

45:23.212 --> 45:24.643
Marylyn said that a ton
of people

45:24.645 --> 45:26.181
have gone missing
in this forest.

45:28.116 --> 45:30.050
Why didn't you tell us this,
McKenzie?

45:30.052 --> 45:33.219
I didn't believe any of it.
I didn't...

45:33.221 --> 45:35.255
I mean, the shit the guy
at the restaurant was saying,

45:35.257 --> 45:36.459
it sounded ridiculous.

45:38.560 --> 45:40.462
But I don't think it is.

45:41.429 --> 45:42.632
I think it's all real, and...

45:43.799 --> 45:46.065
This place is dangerous.

45:46.067 --> 45:48.236
I don't think we are
where we think we are.

45:49.071 --> 45:50.072
Where are we?

45:50.739 --> 45:52.007
Another world.

45:58.212 --> 45:59.746
Pack the stuff, we're leaving.

45:59.748 --> 46:00.813
Martin,
please don't...

46:00.815 --> 46:03.315
Don't you fucking touch me.

46:03.317 --> 46:04.520
You believe this shit?

46:05.487 --> 46:07.156
I don't know, man, do you?

46:08.424 --> 46:09.456
I think I'd rather be the guy
who believes it

46:09.458 --> 46:12.491
and nothing happens
than the other way around.

46:12.493 --> 46:15.094
Pack up the stuff,
we're leaving in ten.

46:15.096 --> 46:17.163
- Come on.
- Darcy, please.

46:17.165 --> 46:18.398
No, wait, wait, wait.
Okay, okay.

46:18.400 --> 46:20.166
I know, I know,
I know I fucked up.

46:20.168 --> 46:21.500
I should have just told you
from the start.

46:23.072 --> 46:24.538
But it's Marylyn.
Marylyn's out there

46:24.540 --> 46:25.771
and she's in danger.

46:25.773 --> 46:29.108
All of us are in danger now,
McKenzie.

46:29.110 --> 46:30.110
Take a look outside.

46:30.112 --> 46:32.679
There is something strange
about this place.

46:32.681 --> 46:33.579
Now we will find Marylyn.

46:33.581 --> 46:35.614
But first, we need
to get out of here,

46:35.616 --> 46:37.052
and we need to figure out
what to do.

46:39.587 --> 46:41.023
Martin, please!

46:41.589 --> 46:42.624
Fuck!

46:43.324 --> 46:44.326
Fuck!

47:01.375 --> 47:04.177
Fine, if you guys wanna just go
ahead and leave that's fine!

47:04.179 --> 47:05.277
Okay. But you are not going
to be able

47:05.279 --> 47:06.279
to find the door without me.

47:06.281 --> 47:09.449
Leave? Why would we leave?
We just got here.

47:09.451 --> 47:11.817
I'm about to cook up some food.
You hungry?

47:11.819 --> 47:14.454
You know what,
I'll get another one.

47:14.456 --> 47:15.458
Here you go, McKenzie.

47:18.594 --> 47:19.628
Where's Edgar?

47:20.628 --> 47:21.695
Edgar?

47:21.697 --> 47:24.630
He's at home recovering.
With my mom.

47:24.632 --> 47:26.500
No. What are you guys
talking about?

47:26.502 --> 47:27.733
His bag is right there.

47:27.735 --> 47:29.504
- No, that's my bag.
- That's not his bag.

47:30.572 --> 47:32.204
Where's Edgar?

47:32.206 --> 47:33.639
Ooh.

47:33.641 --> 47:36.476
Does McKenzie have
a little thing for Edgar?

47:36.478 --> 47:38.712
You know what? Next time,
I'll bring him just for you.

47:39.748 --> 47:42.882
What's wrong with you, sis?
Sit down. Come on.

47:44.853 --> 47:46.552
Edgar!

47:46.554 --> 47:48.420
Hey, grab some firewood
while you're down there,

47:48.422 --> 47:49.556
I don't have too much.

47:49.558 --> 47:50.623
I swear to god
she's stoned.

47:50.625 --> 47:52.427
I knew that she had
a thing for him.

48:00.302 --> 48:02.305
Fuck.

48:03.938 --> 48:05.207
Okay.

48:05.607 --> 48:07.407
Okay.

48:17.418 --> 48:19.589
Come on, come on, come on.

48:23.257 --> 48:24.757
Uh, hello?

48:24.759 --> 48:26.495
You believe me now, don't you?

48:28.596 --> 48:30.730
- Yes.
- <i>That's good.</i>

48:30.732 --> 48:32.898
Now we can get to work.

48:32.900 --> 48:34.400
<i>Did you find
the necklace?</i>

48:34.402 --> 48:36.538
Yes, I found it.

48:37.538 --> 48:38.607
I got it.

48:39.273 --> 48:40.308
That's good.

48:43.612 --> 48:45.277
Have you seen her?

48:45.279 --> 48:48.216
No, Marylyn's not even here.

48:50.319 --> 48:51.851
And my friends, there's
something wrong with them.

48:51.853 --> 48:54.420
They're all confused.
They don't even...

48:54.422 --> 48:56.223
They don't even know
where we are.

48:56.225 --> 48:57.627
Well, they're coming for you.

48:58.726 --> 48:59.929
You've been in there too long.

49:02.496 --> 49:03.498
Who's coming?

49:04.398 --> 49:06.299
<i>The pale ones.</i>

49:06.301 --> 49:08.203
The one's messing
with your friend's minds.

49:10.505 --> 49:12.538
Where the fuck is my sister?

49:12.540 --> 49:14.007
You said that she was here.

49:14.009 --> 49:15.608
<i>She must have left.</i>

49:15.610 --> 49:18.244
I can help you find her.

49:18.246 --> 49:20.012
<i>But you need
to get your friends.</i>

49:20.014 --> 49:21.348
<i>You need to give them the vial.</i>

49:21.350 --> 49:22.518
You need to get out of there.

49:23.719 --> 49:25.317
<i>You're running out of time.</i>

49:25.319 --> 49:26.388
They're coming.

49:27.755 --> 49:31.493
My friend Edgar, he's missing.

49:32.761 --> 49:33.960
<i>Find him.</i>

49:33.962 --> 49:35.364
Then call me back.

50:44.766 --> 50:46.369
Martin. Martin.

50:47.435 --> 50:48.470
Where's Darcy?

50:49.538 --> 50:52.105
Darcy, she's, uh...

50:52.107 --> 50:53.409
Here, drink this.

50:56.078 --> 50:57.380
Okay.

51:00.815 --> 51:01.947
Where's Darcy?

51:01.949 --> 51:03.782
Oh, thank, god.

51:03.784 --> 51:06.855
I don't know.
I couldn't find Edgar, either.

51:08.422 --> 51:09.855
What happened to us?

51:12.127 --> 51:13.893
- You hear that?
- What is that?

51:13.895 --> 51:16.695
It sounds like screaming.

51:16.697 --> 51:18.732
- Oh, my god.
- Help!

51:18.734 --> 51:19.801
Darcy.

51:41.690 --> 51:43.726
Go! Fucking go with Martin!

51:46.795 --> 51:47.830
Fuck!

51:53.168 --> 51:54.470
Please, stop!

51:55.136 --> 51:56.805
Please!

52:00.040 --> 52:01.376
We know what you are.

52:02.610 --> 52:04.643
We know what you are!

52:04.645 --> 52:06.114
You fucked him didn't you?

52:06.815 --> 52:08.384
You fucked him.

52:11.652 --> 52:13.453
Let her go!

52:13.455 --> 52:15.188
I can smell it on you!
You fucked him.

52:15.190 --> 52:16.659
I can smell it on you.

52:18.692 --> 52:20.495
You fucking disgust me!

52:22.130 --> 52:24.130
I can smell it on you.

52:24.132 --> 52:26.469
No, please don't.
Please don't.

52:29.103 --> 52:30.770
Edgar, stop!

52:30.772 --> 52:32.038
Help! Help!

52:32.040 --> 52:33.672
Help! Help!

52:33.674 --> 52:35.074
Please, this man's gone crazy!

52:35.076 --> 52:36.775
- Please!
- Edgar.

52:36.777 --> 52:38.110
- Stop.
- Please!

52:38.112 --> 52:40.012
Please, stop!

52:40.014 --> 52:41.484
Distract him.

52:43.485 --> 52:44.884
You have the devil
inside you.

52:44.886 --> 52:45.987
- Edgar!
- On three.

52:46.755 --> 52:49.521
Edgar, no, no, no.

52:49.523 --> 52:51.491
They're gonna hunt you
all down.

52:51.493 --> 52:52.494
Look at me.

52:52.993 --> 52:54.059
Martin.

52:54.061 --> 52:55.494
One.

52:55.496 --> 52:57.831
They're gonna rip you open.

52:57.833 --> 52:59.465
No! Martin!

52:59.467 --> 53:00.900
Edgar! Two.

53:00.902 --> 53:02.501
- And devour you...
- Edgar, please.

53:02.503 --> 53:03.636
...from the inside.

53:03.638 --> 53:05.103
Three!

53:07.676 --> 53:09.808
No! No! No!

53:09.810 --> 53:10.876
Go help him.

53:10.878 --> 53:11.945
I'm fine.

53:11.947 --> 53:13.679
I'm fine. Help him
with the door.

53:13.681 --> 53:15.683
I'm fine. Help him
with the fucking door!

53:19.487 --> 53:20.989
Shit!

53:25.092 --> 53:26.561
You gotta put
pressure on it.

53:27.194 --> 53:28.594
Try to be still.

53:28.596 --> 53:29.996
It'll bleed more if you move.

53:31.766 --> 53:33.666
Try not to move, baby.

53:37.205 --> 53:39.639
I don't know what to do.

53:39.641 --> 53:41.241
We have to get her
to a hospital.

53:41.243 --> 53:42.741
Right now.

53:44.045 --> 53:46.112
Who are you? Who are you people?

53:46.114 --> 53:48.081
Who are you people?

53:48.083 --> 53:49.581
Do you have any more
of those vials?

53:49.583 --> 53:50.650
I only have one more.

53:50.652 --> 53:52.217
- Get it!
- Okay. Okay.

53:56.123 --> 53:57.757
Breathe. Just breathe.

54:00.027 --> 54:01.226
What...

54:01.228 --> 54:02.764
- Give me that!
- What about Edgar?

54:07.235 --> 54:08.237
Drink this.

54:10.170 --> 54:11.706
- It'll help you.
- God.

54:12.139 --> 54:14.072
Hey. Hey.

54:14.074 --> 54:16.478
- You okay?
- My ankle is broken.

54:17.212 --> 54:19.081
Don't worry about me. Fix Darcy.

54:23.217 --> 54:24.219
Where's Edgar?

54:28.956 --> 54:30.993
He went crazy.
We had to lock him up, okay?

54:32.326 --> 54:34.994
He's having a manic episode.

54:34.996 --> 54:37.130
He's... He's not crazy.
It's just...

54:37.132 --> 54:38.630
We need to help him.

54:38.632 --> 54:40.268
No, that's not what this is.

54:42.636 --> 54:44.105
Fucking, it's something else.

54:48.076 --> 54:49.978
Somebody, help me!

54:51.313 --> 54:53.012
Breathe.

54:53.014 --> 54:55.050
Hey, don't get too close to him.

54:56.685 --> 54:57.916
Shh, look at me.

54:57.918 --> 54:59.054
Breathe.

55:00.154 --> 55:01.223
Please!

55:04.893 --> 55:05.895
McKenzie.

55:09.730 --> 55:11.029
McKenzie,
you're freaking me out.

55:11.031 --> 55:12.230
Please tell me what is going on.

55:12.232 --> 55:13.601
Why am I chained up?

55:14.902 --> 55:17.272
There's blood all over my hands.

55:19.306 --> 55:20.672
Okay, please. Please.

55:20.674 --> 55:21.873
McKenzie, just talk to me.

55:21.875 --> 55:22.977
Tell me what's going on. Please.

55:24.779 --> 55:25.813
You don't remember?

55:27.382 --> 55:28.617
Huh?

55:32.186 --> 55:33.322
No, I don't.

55:35.790 --> 55:36.792
Remember what?

55:39.661 --> 55:40.996
Did something happen? Did I...

55:41.996 --> 55:43.299
Did I do something?

55:45.000 --> 55:46.331
McKenzie, what happened?

55:46.333 --> 55:48.000
You're freaking me out!

55:48.002 --> 55:50.205
There's a fucking bite
on my hand!

55:52.040 --> 55:53.074
Where's Martin?

55:55.710 --> 55:58.811
McKenzie...
McKenzie, where's Darcy?

55:58.813 --> 56:00.115
Please, help. Where's Darcy?

56:01.650 --> 56:04.150
No. No, don't go.

56:04.152 --> 56:05.384
Please. I don't remember.

56:05.386 --> 56:08.221
I don't remember.
Please, just talk to me!

56:08.223 --> 56:10.223
McKenzie, just talk to me,
please!

56:10.225 --> 56:12.025
I don't remember.

56:12.027 --> 56:13.228
I don't remember.

56:16.964 --> 56:18.700
What the fuck is going on?

56:27.808 --> 56:29.377
Oh, fuck!

56:33.380 --> 56:34.382
How is he?

56:36.284 --> 56:38.250
I mean, he doesn't remember
a thing.

56:38.252 --> 56:39.786
Please! Help me!

56:39.788 --> 56:41.788
He seems completely fine,
Martin.

56:41.790 --> 56:42.791
Yeah, well, he's not!

56:43.458 --> 56:44.793
And neither is she.

56:46.994 --> 56:49.964
He is chained up, he can't hurt
anyone else or himself.

56:52.032 --> 56:53.701
Now we need to get her
to a hospital.

56:54.902 --> 56:56.071
Fuck it! Help me!

56:57.806 --> 56:59.371
All right, baby, listen to me.

56:59.373 --> 57:02.208
We're gonna lift you up
really slow, okay?

57:02.210 --> 57:04.009
I'm gonna get you out of here.

57:04.011 --> 57:05.110
One...

57:05.112 --> 57:06.179
Two...

57:06.181 --> 57:08.313
Three.

57:09.750 --> 57:10.918
We can't be moving her.

57:15.757 --> 57:17.322
You have to run for help.

57:17.324 --> 57:18.761
You know where the portal is.

57:20.027 --> 57:21.295
I'll keep after these three.

57:22.831 --> 57:23.962
You get to that car,

57:23.964 --> 57:25.831
and you drive
as fast as you can,

57:25.833 --> 57:26.935
and you call for help.

57:32.172 --> 57:33.775
- Okay?
- Okay.

57:35.743 --> 57:36.744
Okay.

57:47.455 --> 57:48.456
Shit.

57:50.190 --> 57:51.757
Fuck!

57:51.759 --> 57:52.794
Shut it!

57:53.460 --> 57:54.527
Check that window!

57:54.529 --> 57:55.527
Check that window!

57:55.529 --> 57:56.931
Please don't jump out.
Please don't jump out.

57:58.500 --> 58:00.366
Nope. There's nothing there.

58:00.368 --> 58:02.003
What the fuck was that thing?

58:02.804 --> 58:04.337
It was his wife.

58:04.339 --> 58:05.804
From the picture?

58:05.806 --> 58:07.172
What the fuck is wrong with her?

58:07.174 --> 58:08.176
I don't know.

58:08.942 --> 58:09.944
What do we do?

58:12.080 --> 58:13.081
Does that work here?

58:14.181 --> 58:15.248
Call 911.

58:15.250 --> 58:17.416
Have them pin our location
and send an ambulance.

58:17.418 --> 58:19.786
Oh, fuck that. Tell them
send a goddamn helicopter.

58:19.788 --> 58:21.757
- Get us off this mountain!
- Okay!

58:27.462 --> 58:30.862
Uh, 911? Yes, we're
in Cinder National Park.

58:30.864 --> 58:32.297
Two of my friends
are very badly injured.

58:32.299 --> 58:33.935
We need medical assistance,
please.

58:34.502 --> 58:35.737
<i>Hey, kid.</i>

58:38.139 --> 58:39.174
Leon?

58:40.842 --> 58:42.010
<i>Did you find Edgar?</i>

58:44.045 --> 58:45.210
Something's wrong with him.

58:45.212 --> 58:47.115
He went crazy.
He attacked one of us.

58:47.915 --> 58:48.950
Put it on speaker.

58:53.955 --> 58:55.357
<i>Have you seen my wife?</i>

58:57.058 --> 58:58.891
She's out there.

58:58.893 --> 58:59.994
Somewhere.

59:01.529 --> 59:03.161
I thought you said
that they wouldn't be able

59:03.163 --> 59:06.331
to make us see things,
if we drank the vials.

59:06.333 --> 59:08.036
<i>The drink will keep
the visions out.</i>

59:10.138 --> 59:11.540
<i>She's not a vision, she's real.</i>

59:14.007 --> 59:16.011
<i>A demon's inside her,
like your friend.</i>

59:18.378 --> 59:19.547
Well, how do we get it
out of him?

59:20.982 --> 59:23.181
<i>You can't.</i>

59:23.183 --> 59:24.986
<i>You need to leave.
Go to the portal.</i>

59:26.054 --> 59:27.920
Where is Marylyn?

59:27.922 --> 59:29.424
Where the fuck is our sister?

59:34.862 --> 59:36.364
She was never here, was she?

59:40.067 --> 59:42.268
<i>No.</i>

59:42.270 --> 59:45.474
<i>But I can show you where she is,
if you bring me the necklace.</i>

59:46.574 --> 59:48.241
<i>Go to the portal,</i>

59:48.243 --> 59:49.444
<i>I'll have someone
meet you there.</i>

59:50.478 --> 59:51.580
<i>Go now.</i>

59:52.980 --> 59:54.015
Portal?

59:55.415 --> 59:56.949
He lied to me.

59:56.951 --> 59:58.016
She was never here.

59:58.018 --> 59:59.985
What does he mean by portal?

59:59.987 --> 01:00:02.054
It's the way that we came in.

01:00:02.056 --> 01:00:03.655
The path that we turned off on.
It's like a door.

01:00:03.657 --> 01:00:05.157
Is that how
you had me walk first?

01:00:05.159 --> 01:00:06.558
Oh, you fucking bitch.

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:07.626
- Shut up!
- Enough!

01:00:07.628 --> 01:00:10.429
Enough! Both of you.

01:00:10.431 --> 01:00:13.467
Now, we need to focus
on what we do now.

01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:16.271
Huh?

01:00:18.038 --> 01:00:19.174
I'll make a run for it.

01:00:23.944 --> 01:00:25.080
Just take this.

01:00:26.647 --> 01:00:29.250
Keep trying, and tell him
to send help.

01:00:55.543 --> 01:00:56.545
Hey.

01:00:58.612 --> 01:01:00.482
<i>McKenzie went
to get help, okay?</i>

01:01:02.449 --> 01:01:03.648
That hurts.

01:01:03.650 --> 01:01:04.583
I know.

01:01:04.585 --> 01:01:07.619
I know, but yeah,
you're gonna be fine.

01:01:07.621 --> 01:01:09.020
Okay?

01:01:09.022 --> 01:01:10.456
Look at me.

01:01:10.458 --> 01:01:11.593
I promise you.

01:01:12.393 --> 01:01:13.462
You're good.

01:01:15.395 --> 01:01:17.630
Where's Edgar? Is he okay?

01:01:17.632 --> 01:01:20.132
Yeah. Uh...

01:01:20.134 --> 01:01:23.201
We had to lock him up,
but he can't hurt anyone. Okay?

01:01:23.203 --> 01:01:24.672
Shh.

01:01:27.208 --> 01:01:29.407
It wasn't him.
He didn't mean to do it.

01:01:29.409 --> 01:01:31.480
- He's sick. He's sick.
- Oh, I know. I know.

01:01:32.513 --> 01:01:33.547
It's not him.

01:02:11.552 --> 01:02:12.554
Please.

01:02:17.125 --> 01:02:18.327
McKenzie went to get help.

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:20.362
Martin, please.

01:02:22.563 --> 01:02:24.532
Please take me out
of these chains, man.

01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:26.969
What's in you, man?

01:02:28.536 --> 01:02:29.538
Huh? Is it...

01:02:44.185 --> 01:02:46.684
Oh, fuck! It burns!

01:02:46.686 --> 01:02:50.188
Oh, god, Martin, it burns.
It burns on the inside!

01:02:50.190 --> 01:02:51.456
Martin.

01:02:59.132 --> 01:03:01.335
They're coming for you.

01:03:02.170 --> 01:03:03.268
Eddie!

01:03:03.270 --> 01:03:04.739
Run.

01:03:06.306 --> 01:03:07.708
Run.

01:03:08.708 --> 01:03:10.311
They're coming for you.

01:03:14.081 --> 01:03:15.317
They're coming for you!

01:03:20.587 --> 01:03:21.622
Run!

01:03:23.790 --> 01:03:25.760
They're coming for you!

01:03:30.364 --> 01:03:32.398
Goddamn it, Darcy,
what are you doing?

01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:33.535
I want to see him.

01:03:34.768 --> 01:03:36.768
He didn't mean to do it, please.

01:03:40.741 --> 01:03:42.277
Where the fuck is Gerrik?

01:03:47.147 --> 01:03:48.783
Listen to me.
I need you to stay here.

01:03:50.485 --> 01:03:51.486
Gerrik!

01:03:52.453 --> 01:03:53.455
Gerrik?

01:03:54.355 --> 01:03:55.557
You promised me.

01:03:57.157 --> 01:03:58.324
You said you loved me.

01:03:58.326 --> 01:03:59.594
I never loved you.

01:04:01.462 --> 01:04:02.630
You left me.

01:04:03.531 --> 01:04:05.764
You disgusted me.

01:04:05.766 --> 01:04:07.469
I couldn't look at you
any longer.

01:04:10.571 --> 01:04:11.572
Why?

01:04:12.473 --> 01:04:13.475
You're worthless.

01:04:14.808 --> 01:04:16.644
Who would love someone like you?

01:04:18.346 --> 01:04:19.414
You.

01:04:21.715 --> 01:04:23.415
You said you loved me.

01:04:23.417 --> 01:04:24.418
I lied.

01:04:28.788 --> 01:04:30.655
No one loves you.

01:04:30.657 --> 01:04:31.793
No one loves you.

01:04:32.527 --> 01:04:34.159
My friends do.

01:04:34.161 --> 01:04:35.163
Where are they?

01:04:36.163 --> 01:04:37.496
Helping Darcy.

01:04:37.498 --> 01:04:38.633
They're not helping you.

01:04:40.534 --> 01:04:41.670
Come with me.

01:04:42.402 --> 01:04:43.404
Where?

01:04:44.772 --> 01:04:45.873
I'll show you.

01:04:47.275 --> 01:04:48.477
I'll show you.

01:04:57.317 --> 01:04:58.419
Gerrik!

01:05:01.956 --> 01:05:03.158
Hello?

01:05:09.630 --> 01:05:12.864
Hello? Listen, man,
I know you're there.

01:05:12.866 --> 01:05:13.868
Hello?

01:05:20.373 --> 01:05:22.241
Fuck. Listen to me.

01:05:22.243 --> 01:05:23.308
I need you to stay here.

01:05:23.310 --> 01:05:24.311
I'll be right back.

01:05:40.994 --> 01:05:42.864
Oh, Marylyn.

01:05:48.502 --> 01:05:49.538
Are you okay?

01:05:50.705 --> 01:05:51.739
Marylyn.

01:05:52.672 --> 01:05:53.739
Okay.

01:05:53.741 --> 01:05:54.840
Okay.

01:06:17.831 --> 01:06:18.833
Gerrik!

01:06:20.567 --> 01:06:21.735
Darcy!

01:06:25.672 --> 01:06:26.674
Edgar.

01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:36.315
Darcy, please!
Darcy, help me!

01:06:36.317 --> 01:06:38.284
Help me, please.

01:06:44.792 --> 01:06:45.860
Darcy.

01:06:46.927 --> 01:06:48.763
Please help me.

01:06:52.699 --> 01:06:53.734
Gerrik!

01:07:08.449 --> 01:07:09.517
Leon.

01:07:10.618 --> 01:07:11.583
Look, man.

01:07:11.585 --> 01:07:14.085
I know that whatever
is happening out here,

01:07:14.087 --> 01:07:15.756
is way bigger than all of us.

01:07:17.657 --> 01:07:21.492
My fiancée, she is hurt
really bad.

01:07:21.494 --> 01:07:23.797
She needs help, man,
or she's not gonna make it.

01:07:36.543 --> 01:07:37.645
Darcy, what happened?

01:07:39.846 --> 01:07:41.382
Darcy, are you okay?
What happened?

01:07:43.551 --> 01:07:45.951
I'm so sorry...

01:07:45.953 --> 01:07:49.020
Oh, god, what is wrong with me?
Just fucking kill me now.

01:07:49.022 --> 01:07:50.956
I can't take this.
I can't take it.

01:07:50.958 --> 01:07:52.726
It's okay. Shh.

01:07:54.594 --> 01:07:55.793
It's okay, I'm okay.

01:07:55.795 --> 01:07:58.364
I know it's not you.

01:07:58.366 --> 01:08:00.965
I would never hurt you, Darcy,
I'm so sorry.

01:08:00.967 --> 01:08:02.303
I would never.

01:08:04.871 --> 01:08:06.040
You're just sick.

01:08:06.906 --> 01:08:08.907
I'm so...

01:08:08.909 --> 01:08:10.345
What's wrong with me?

01:08:11.846 --> 01:08:14.112
They put me
in fucking chains, Darcy!

01:08:14.114 --> 01:08:15.814
What is wrong with me?

01:08:15.816 --> 01:08:17.018
You just scared...

01:08:17.951 --> 01:08:19.618
You scared them.

01:08:19.620 --> 01:08:20.689
But I'm fine now.

01:08:21.488 --> 01:08:22.890
I'm fine. I'm fine.

01:08:23.557 --> 01:08:24.559
Please.

01:08:25.759 --> 01:08:26.828
I know.

01:08:27.794 --> 01:08:29.161
Please, let me out.

01:08:29.162 --> 01:08:31.430
I can't stay in these
fucking chains anymore.

01:08:31.432 --> 01:08:32.966
They're driving me,
they're driving me crazy.

01:08:36.069 --> 01:08:38.439
Please, Darcy. If I don't
get out, I'm gonna die.

01:08:40.774 --> 01:08:42.710
How? I don't...
I don't have the key.

01:08:47.514 --> 01:08:48.515
The axe.

01:08:51.584 --> 01:08:53.085
Darcy, get the axe.

01:08:53.087 --> 01:08:56.825
Man, you got what you wanted.
And I am sorry about your wife.

01:08:59.893 --> 01:09:00.895
But our friend...

01:09:02.662 --> 01:09:03.895
Man, there's something in him,

01:09:03.897 --> 01:09:05.529
and I don't know how
to help him.

01:09:05.532 --> 01:09:06.734
<i>You can't help him.</i>

01:09:07.535 --> 01:09:08.600
You can do it.

01:09:12.939 --> 01:09:14.671
- You can do it.
- <i>A demon is eating him</i>

01:09:14.674 --> 01:09:16.542
<i>from the inside.</i>

01:09:16.544 --> 01:09:18.710
Come on, man. There's got
to be something I can do.

01:09:18.712 --> 01:09:20.612
<i>You can cut off his head.</i>

01:09:20.613 --> 01:09:22.814
<i>Or you can burn him.</i>

01:09:22.816 --> 01:09:24.886
<i>Otherwise, he won't stop coming
for you.</i>

01:09:27.854 --> 01:09:29.153
I don't think I could do it.

01:09:29.154 --> 01:09:30.424
You got it.

01:09:36.696 --> 01:09:38.997
Okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop!

01:09:38.999 --> 01:09:40.832
Stop! Don't.

01:09:40.834 --> 01:09:42.899
I can't. It hurts so bad.

01:09:52.245 --> 01:09:54.481
This is all my fault.
Everything is my fault.

01:09:56.249 --> 01:09:57.748
Everything.

01:09:57.750 --> 01:09:59.618
I'm so sorry.

01:09:59.620 --> 01:10:01.854
It's gonna be okay. Shh.

01:10:02.990 --> 01:10:05.059
You're gonna be okay. Shh.

01:10:06.927 --> 01:10:08.429
Will you hold me?

01:10:13.901 --> 01:10:15.036
I got you.

01:10:16.136 --> 01:10:17.502
Come here.

01:10:17.504 --> 01:10:18.639
I got you.

01:10:20.173 --> 01:10:21.176
Come here.

01:10:24.111 --> 01:10:25.644
I got you.

01:10:31.218 --> 01:10:32.921
Do you remember
when we were younger?

01:10:34.521 --> 01:10:36.490
And mom and dad would fight,
and they would yell.

01:10:38.225 --> 01:10:39.794
And you'd get so scared.

01:10:41.896 --> 01:10:43.731
And you'd come into my room
and, uh...

01:10:46.767 --> 01:10:48.699
And I would hold you
just like this.

01:10:55.241 --> 01:10:56.975
I remember.

01:10:56.977 --> 01:10:59.778
You remember that?

01:10:59.780 --> 01:11:01.983
- It's gonna be okay.
- Mm-hm.

01:11:02.682 --> 01:11:04.181
Yeah.

01:11:04.183 --> 01:11:06.885
You're gonna be okay.

01:11:06.887 --> 01:11:08.188
They're getting us out.

01:11:11.926 --> 01:11:13.824
You gotta believe me.
They will.

01:11:13.826 --> 01:11:15.594
They went to get us out.

01:11:15.596 --> 01:11:16.731
No, they're not.

01:11:23.670 --> 01:11:24.972
It won't let you go.

01:11:47.093 --> 01:11:48.760
Please, man.

01:11:48.762 --> 01:11:50.295
<i>You must try to get out
of there.</i>

01:11:50.297 --> 01:11:52.232
<i>I'd love to know all
that you've seen.</i>

01:12:09.016 --> 01:12:10.018
Darcy.

01:12:15.722 --> 01:12:16.723
Darcy...

01:12:20.361 --> 01:12:21.859
No. No.

01:12:21.861 --> 01:12:22.864
Darcy?

01:12:57.697 --> 01:12:58.865
Oh, my god.

01:12:59.333 --> 01:13:00.802
We can't leave.

01:13:21.187 --> 01:13:23.822
You fucking cunt!

01:13:40.339 --> 01:13:41.409
Ow!

01:13:42.308 --> 01:13:43.977
Why did you kick me?

01:13:49.982 --> 01:13:51.949
Darcy, stay away from him.

01:13:51.951 --> 01:13:54.021
- Darcy?
- That's not Darcy.

01:14:04.431 --> 01:14:06.067
Go, go, go. Go!

01:14:14.907 --> 01:14:16.341
What? No. Don't stop.
We can't stop.

01:14:16.343 --> 01:14:18.143
This is it!
This is where we turned off.

01:14:20.780 --> 01:14:22.883
Where's Darcy? What was that?

01:14:24.450 --> 01:14:26.818
That was not Darcy.

01:14:26.820 --> 01:14:29.956
I don't know what that was,
but it was not her.

01:14:35.395 --> 01:14:36.431
She's dead.

01:14:37.498 --> 01:14:39.463
Edgar killed her.

01:14:39.465 --> 01:14:41.233
- I'm sorry, Martin.
- Oh, god, Darcy.

01:14:42.369 --> 01:14:44.935
I'm so sorry, Martin.

01:14:44.937 --> 01:14:46.938
This is all my fault.

01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:47.942
I'm so sorry.

01:14:49.142 --> 01:14:51.309
It is not your fault.

01:14:51.311 --> 01:14:52.476
Look at me.

01:14:52.478 --> 01:14:54.147
He lied to you.

01:14:55.782 --> 01:14:57.015
But Marylyn.

01:14:57.017 --> 01:14:58.315
She's gotta be...

01:14:58.317 --> 01:14:59.887
She's gotta be in here.

01:15:01.487 --> 01:15:03.320
We'll find her.

01:15:03.322 --> 01:15:05.090
We're gonna find Marylyn.

01:15:05.092 --> 01:15:07.058
And we're gonna make
that motherfucker pay

01:15:07.060 --> 01:15:08.359
for putting us in here.

01:15:08.361 --> 01:15:10.130
No, he's the only one
who can help us.

01:15:11.498 --> 01:15:13.234
He's the only one
who can get us out.

01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:15.335
We have to call him.

01:15:17.337 --> 01:15:19.003
Cellphone.

01:15:19.005 --> 01:15:20.070
What?

01:15:20.072 --> 01:15:21.072
I left it.

01:15:21.074 --> 01:15:22.506
- I need to go get it.
- No, no, no.

01:15:22.508 --> 01:15:24.376
I can figure it out.
I can find it, okay?

01:15:24.378 --> 01:15:25.310
I can find it.
Just give me a minute

01:15:25.312 --> 01:15:27.147
- to think about it first.
- Just shut up.

01:15:28.347 --> 01:15:29.413
Shut up.

01:15:35.489 --> 01:15:36.491
What do we do?

01:15:42.195 --> 01:15:43.396
- You stay here.
- No.

01:15:44.063 --> 01:15:45.462
I'm faster.

01:15:45.464 --> 01:15:48.332
I can get to the phone
by myself. Okay?

01:15:48.334 --> 01:15:49.536
Don't go back.

01:15:50.904 --> 01:15:52.170
I love you sis.

01:15:52.172 --> 01:15:53.241
I'm sorry.

01:15:56.843 --> 01:15:57.975
- Please.
- Just stay here.

01:15:57.977 --> 01:16:00.213
Martin, I'm sorry.

01:16:02.382 --> 01:16:04.616
- Please.
- I'm gonna be right back.

01:16:04.618 --> 01:16:06.318
No, Martin, don't leave me.

01:16:31.078 --> 01:16:32.179
Aah!

01:16:49.329 --> 01:16:50.431
Martin!

01:16:54.935 --> 01:16:56.201
Kenz.

01:16:56.203 --> 01:16:58.636
Martin! She's in there!

01:16:58.638 --> 01:17:01.007
- McKenzie!
- I'm here!

01:17:02.142 --> 01:17:03.411
I'm right here!

01:17:04.244 --> 01:17:05.976
Kenz?

01:17:08.281 --> 01:17:11.082
- McKenzie?
- I'm here!

01:17:11.084 --> 01:17:12.954
Where did you go Kenz? Come on.

01:17:14.922 --> 01:17:16.156
Martin!

01:17:20.227 --> 01:17:21.295
He can't see you.

01:17:23.262 --> 01:17:25.529
- Why not?
- Well, he's in there.

01:17:25.531 --> 01:17:27.101
You can't see the real world
in there.

01:17:32.071 --> 01:17:34.171
Martin, I'm right here!

01:17:34.173 --> 01:17:35.442
Here, let me help you.

01:17:37.511 --> 01:17:39.213
Ow.

01:17:39.980 --> 01:17:41.479
Ow, no.

01:17:43.115 --> 01:17:44.985
What did you do?

01:17:47.486 --> 01:17:50.188
Still can't hear you.

01:17:50.190 --> 01:17:51.359
No.

01:17:52.426 --> 01:17:53.660
Stop!

01:17:56.663 --> 01:17:58.997
Stop!

01:17:58.999 --> 01:18:01.533
No.

01:18:03.102 --> 01:18:05.071
Whoo-hoo!

01:18:05.638 --> 01:18:07.439
Feisty one.

01:18:07.441 --> 01:18:10.308
Jesus Christ, man.
We don't have all fucking day.

01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:12.143
- No!
- I might hold on to her.

01:18:13.512 --> 01:18:15.113
Oh, god.
Don't make me.

01:18:15.115 --> 01:18:16.648
Well, then help!

01:18:16.650 --> 01:18:19.250
This is fucking pathetic.

01:18:22.155 --> 01:18:23.387
Try the cross again.

01:18:23.389 --> 01:18:24.689
I think she's clean.

01:18:24.691 --> 01:18:26.360
Did I ask
what you think?

01:18:27.593 --> 01:18:29.193
Uh...

01:18:29.195 --> 01:18:30.261
I think I'm gonna burn her.

01:18:30.263 --> 01:18:32.465
No, we're waiting
for Leon for that.

01:18:36.268 --> 01:18:37.570
Hm. She's awake.

01:18:49.182 --> 01:18:50.985
Help.

01:18:51.551 --> 01:18:53.254
Here. Have a sip.

01:18:55.054 --> 01:18:57.191
You know those tranqs
can really dry you out.

01:18:59.325 --> 01:19:00.560
There you go.

01:19:06.298 --> 01:19:07.634
Now this is gonna hurt a bit.

01:19:10.803 --> 01:19:12.237
No! No, no, no!

01:19:12.239 --> 01:19:13.537
Please! Please! Please!

01:19:24.450 --> 01:19:26.518
Goddamn it,
I thought I told you to wait.

01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:29.156
And I told you not to use
Andrew's boys anymore.

01:19:30.456 --> 01:19:31.525
How are you feeling, sweetheart?

01:19:32.758 --> 01:19:34.525
Oh.

01:19:36.730 --> 01:19:38.729
You do that again,

01:19:38.731 --> 01:19:40.665
you're gonna be
spitting up blood and teeth.

01:19:40.667 --> 01:19:42.203
It's fine. It's fine.

01:19:43.637 --> 01:19:45.072
I guess I deserved that.

01:19:47.139 --> 01:19:48.209
Where are we?

01:19:49.442 --> 01:19:51.309
Those things in the forest...

01:19:51.311 --> 01:19:53.644
Don't worry.
We're far outside Cinder Park.

01:19:53.646 --> 01:19:56.747
We're safe here,
we're outside the portal.

01:19:56.749 --> 01:20:00.784
- What were they?
- We call them Drogyr.

01:20:00.786 --> 01:20:04.588
- What do you call them boys?
- Pale fuckers.

01:20:04.590 --> 01:20:06.427
See, everybody's got
their names for 'em.

01:20:07.561 --> 01:20:08.725
They're body possessors.

01:20:08.727 --> 01:20:10.528
That's why we needed
to do all this.

01:20:10.530 --> 01:20:12.262
We needed to make sure
that you were you,

01:20:12.264 --> 01:20:13.633
and not something else. Hm?

01:20:15.201 --> 01:20:17.704
If my brother's dead
because of you...

01:20:20.339 --> 01:20:22.239
I'm gonna kill you.

01:20:22.241 --> 01:20:24.375
I'm gonna kill all of you.

01:20:24.377 --> 01:20:25.413
I like this girl.

01:20:27.513 --> 01:20:29.814
Now you hold your horses.

01:20:29.816 --> 01:20:31.616
Your brother's alive.

01:20:31.618 --> 01:20:33.553
He called me just as I was
on the way over here.

01:20:34.553 --> 01:20:36.787
Okay, Leon.

01:20:36.789 --> 01:20:39.623
This has been fun and all,
but you know.

01:20:39.625 --> 01:20:41.728
The Carousel's starting soon
and we got to go.

01:20:43.195 --> 01:20:44.328
Untie her, Charl.

01:20:44.330 --> 01:20:45.833
And you keep an eye
on her, okay?

01:20:47.534 --> 01:20:49.734
So, which Axiom
is it this year, boys?

01:20:49.736 --> 01:20:51.402
Number four.
So we need something

01:20:51.404 --> 01:20:53.171
that's gonna put those big
motherfuckers to sleep.

01:20:53.173 --> 01:20:54.439
- Something...
- Nothing's gonna put

01:20:54.441 --> 01:20:56.210
a Leviathan to sleep.

01:20:59.178 --> 01:21:00.647
Oh, you know,
I might have something.

01:21:10.456 --> 01:21:13.690
The boys around these parts
like to hold competitions.

01:21:13.692 --> 01:21:16.461
They go into the different
Axioms and, uh,

01:21:16.463 --> 01:21:20.301
try to survive or see
what creatures they can kill.

01:21:21.433 --> 01:21:23.337
Those doors,
there's more than one?

01:21:25.172 --> 01:21:27.271
Oh, yeah. There are a few.

01:21:27.273 --> 01:21:29.474
A couple of sprays of this,
they won't know you're there.

01:21:29.476 --> 01:21:30.678
Like bug spray.

01:21:31.710 --> 01:21:33.344
Just don't get stepped on.

01:21:33.346 --> 01:21:36.413
Oh.
Thank you, kindly.

01:21:36.415 --> 01:21:38.750
Now you do know this is
considered cheating, right?

01:21:38.752 --> 01:21:40.521
Well, we won't tell anyone
if you don't.

01:21:41.420 --> 01:21:44.255
You people are sick.

01:21:44.257 --> 01:21:46.460
You know what's in there,
and you just let people go in?

01:21:50.429 --> 01:21:51.962
Now, now.

01:21:51.964 --> 01:21:53.931
We've all lost people
in the Axiom.

01:21:56.503 --> 01:21:57.868
My wife.

01:21:57.870 --> 01:21:59.507
How could you let her go
in there?

01:22:01.575 --> 01:22:02.710
I didn't let her go in.

01:22:03.810 --> 01:22:04.879
I put her in there.

01:22:06.745 --> 01:22:08.345
Why?

01:22:08.347 --> 01:22:10.917
Well, now, McKenzie,
that is none of your business.

01:22:11.884 --> 01:22:14.551
That's between me, and Jessica,

01:22:14.553 --> 01:22:16.322
and a man no one's
gonna see again.

01:22:17.691 --> 01:22:19.393
Did you put Marylyn in there?

01:22:21.361 --> 01:22:22.563
I sure did.

01:22:24.998 --> 01:22:26.997
You son of a fucking bitch!

01:22:26.999 --> 01:22:28.866
Hey!

01:22:30.536 --> 01:22:32.205
Take it easy now, little lady.

01:22:34.874 --> 01:22:36.573
You put her in there?

01:22:36.575 --> 01:22:39.443
Well, first, we started
with her friends.

01:22:39.445 --> 01:22:41.878
But we chose a door
with a really special beast.

01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:45.716
I mean this thing is a natural
born killer, a real hunter.

01:22:45.718 --> 01:22:48.485
So one by one, we put
Marylyn's friends in there.

01:22:48.487 --> 01:22:50.454
Each time,
it takes the bait.

01:22:50.456 --> 01:22:51.922
And then I chained
Marylyn there.

01:22:51.924 --> 01:22:54.494
Damn it, three weeks later,
it still hasn't killed her.

01:22:56.396 --> 01:22:58.962
I knew your sister was special.

01:22:58.964 --> 01:23:00.801
I think we can have us some fun.

01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:09.777
You see. Marylyn's still alive.

01:23:11.311 --> 01:23:14.278
And your brother's still alive.

01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:16.680
I mean, there's still time,
we could save one of them.

01:23:16.682 --> 01:23:18.484
Question is, which one
do you wanna save?

01:23:19.486 --> 01:23:20.752
One?

01:23:20.754 --> 01:23:23.257
Well, they're both still alive,
but they're in different Axioms.

01:23:24.990 --> 01:23:26.326
Who do you want to save?

01:23:41.574 --> 01:23:43.006
I think you're making
the right choice.

01:23:43.008 --> 01:23:44.809
Shut up.

01:23:44.811 --> 01:23:46.778
I guess it's like
a sisters thing.

01:23:46.780 --> 01:23:47.845
I wouldn't understand.

01:23:47.847 --> 01:23:50.848
I said shut the fuck up!

01:23:50.850 --> 01:23:52.953
We're going to get Martin
right after we save Marylyn.

01:23:57.356 --> 01:24:00.457
Where did it come from?
The Axiom.

01:24:00.459 --> 01:24:03.094
Well, the story goes,
it showed up in the '50s.

01:24:03.096 --> 01:24:06.530
Government came up here.
They took over the land,

01:24:06.532 --> 01:24:08.832
started doing tests.

01:24:08.834 --> 01:24:10.503
Then one day,
they just up and left.

01:24:11.971 --> 01:24:13.706
Some boys
found a doorway.

01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:17.408
Then they found another.

01:24:17.410 --> 01:24:21.546
You know, people go missing
in national parks all the time.

01:24:21.548 --> 01:24:25.049
Most of them are found,
but some...

01:24:25.051 --> 01:24:28.051
Some just disappear
off the face of the Earth.

01:24:28.053 --> 01:24:29.623
How many doors are there?

01:24:30.789 --> 01:24:31.958
We've found six.

01:24:33.927 --> 01:24:36.362
And what's in the other Axioms?

01:24:36.963 --> 01:24:38.432
All kinds of beasts.

01:24:39.365 --> 01:24:40.566
Monsters.

01:24:41.935 --> 01:24:44.502
Who knows about this?

01:24:44.504 --> 01:24:48.706
Well, us locals, you know,
keep it a secret.

01:24:48.708 --> 01:24:50.640
If the government finds out,
they'd come up here again.

01:24:50.642 --> 01:24:52.346
They'd take our land,
they'd take our houses.

01:24:54.079 --> 01:24:57.383
Sometimes, secrets get out.

01:24:59.886 --> 01:25:01.885
Cinder Falls there, there.
There's a door.

01:25:01.887 --> 01:25:04.822
Oh, no. No, your sister's
not in there.

01:25:04.824 --> 01:25:06.957
Those boys with the painted
faces, they're in there.

01:25:06.959 --> 01:25:08.760
Competing in carousel.

01:25:08.762 --> 01:25:11.395
Oh... Creatures in there.

01:25:11.397 --> 01:25:12.598
Mighty big.

01:25:31.750 --> 01:25:32.985
Cinder peak.

01:25:33.786 --> 01:25:35.455
We're here.

01:25:37.723 --> 01:25:40.060
Portal's straight through there.
You just follow the lights.

01:25:42.928 --> 01:25:43.963
And what's in there?

01:25:44.798 --> 01:25:46.367
We call it the Rapax.

01:25:48.834 --> 01:25:50.870
As long as it's off hunting,
you should be okay.

01:25:53.705 --> 01:25:55.439
You're not coming in with me?

01:25:55.441 --> 01:25:57.910
Sorry, hun. This is as far
as my help extends.

01:26:00.079 --> 01:26:01.546
Give me your gun.

01:26:03.215 --> 01:26:04.685
Nice try, kid.

01:26:06.151 --> 01:26:07.754
Here, I'll give you
this flashlight.

01:26:08.788 --> 01:26:10.456
It gets very dark in there.

01:26:11.557 --> 01:26:13.623
Now you listen to me.

01:26:13.625 --> 01:26:16.730
You get in there fast,
you might just get out.

01:26:20.866 --> 01:26:22.168
And what if I see it?

01:26:24.471 --> 01:26:26.673
Well, like I said...

01:26:28.106 --> 01:26:29.709
let's just hope
it's off hunting.

01:27:49.655 --> 01:27:51.122
Marylyn? Marylyn!

01:27:51.124 --> 01:27:53.224
Marylyn!

01:27:53.226 --> 01:27:56.726
Okay, I'm gonna get you
out of here.

01:27:56.728 --> 01:27:57.961
Were you bad, too?

01:27:57.963 --> 01:28:00.898
No, no, no.
I'm here to help you, okay?

01:28:00.900 --> 01:28:02.332
We were bad...

01:28:02.334 --> 01:28:05.569
We're bad,
that's why we're here.

01:28:06.838 --> 01:28:08.805
Okay.

01:28:13.012 --> 01:28:14.845
- I can't get it.
- No! No!

01:28:14.847 --> 01:28:16.780
- Shh.
- He will punish me.

01:28:16.782 --> 01:28:18.315
- I'll be right back.
- No...

01:28:18.317 --> 01:28:20.083
I'm going somewhere
and I'm going to get something.

01:28:20.085 --> 01:28:21.918
- I'll be right back.
- No!

01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:23.688
I will be right back. Shh.

01:29:26.785 --> 01:29:28.952
Okay. Okay.

01:29:30.022 --> 01:29:31.122
- Shh.
- Oh, he's...

01:29:31.124 --> 01:29:33.224
- He's coming.
- Shh! Shh!

01:29:33.226 --> 01:29:34.792
He's coming!

01:29:34.794 --> 01:29:36.760
- He's coming!
- Shh!

01:29:36.762 --> 01:29:37.827
Shut up.

01:29:46.071 --> 01:29:47.904
Oh, no... Oh, no.

01:29:53.780 --> 01:29:55.779
I can't get it.

01:29:55.781 --> 01:29:57.081
You can't leave.

01:29:57.083 --> 01:29:58.349
- You can't leave.
- Shh.

01:29:58.351 --> 01:30:00.350
I'm not gonna leave, okay?
I'm not gonna leave.

01:30:00.352 --> 01:30:02.989
I just need something bigger.

01:30:04.322 --> 01:30:07.024
- Where is it?
- No.

01:30:07.026 --> 01:30:09.393
No. It won't let us leave.

01:30:09.395 --> 01:30:11.263
We'll be here...
We'll be here forever.

01:30:14.901 --> 01:30:16.100
No. Marylyn, you can't.

01:30:16.102 --> 01:30:18.301
No, no! Please, no!

01:30:18.303 --> 01:30:20.706
Please, no. No!

01:30:22.741 --> 01:30:25.012
What did you do?
What did you do?

01:30:27.079 --> 01:30:28.948
No! No...

01:31:25.303 --> 01:31:27.373
Oh, baby.
Baby, I'm sorry.

01:31:29.542 --> 01:31:31.911
I'm so fucking sorry.

01:31:42.922 --> 01:31:44.090
Aw.

01:31:45.391 --> 01:31:46.460
Poor girl.

01:32:02.575 --> 01:32:03.910
Jesus!

01:32:10.850 --> 01:32:11.852
Drive.

01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:17.121
Oh, god. Oh, no.

01:32:17.123 --> 01:32:18.588
Oh, fuck.

01:32:18.590 --> 01:32:20.890
We shouldn't be in here
without drinking the vials.

01:32:20.892 --> 01:32:23.060
- Walk!
- Oh, no. Oh, no. Fuck.

01:32:23.062 --> 01:32:24.461
Oh, no. Oh, no, no.

01:32:24.463 --> 01:32:26.930
No, no. Fuck!
They're fucking everywhere!

01:32:26.932 --> 01:32:28.431
They're in my fucking head!

01:32:28.433 --> 01:32:30.600
They're fucking everywhere!
They're fucking everywhere!

01:32:30.602 --> 01:32:32.469
They're coming!
They're fucking everywhere!

01:32:32.471 --> 01:32:36.473
They're fucking every,
fucking, where.

01:32:36.475 --> 01:32:39.877
Hey. I had you fooled there
for a moment, didn't I?

01:32:39.879 --> 01:32:43.279
Eh? I got my fucking freak on.

01:32:43.281 --> 01:32:44.316
You know...

01:32:45.218 --> 01:32:46.353
it's been a fun ride, kid.

01:32:47.152 --> 01:32:48.484
But this,

01:32:48.486 --> 01:32:52.323
this is the end
of the fucking ride.

01:32:57.495 --> 01:32:58.498
Hey.

01:32:59.965 --> 01:33:00.967
Hey.

01:33:01.601 --> 01:33:03.167
Hey, Jessie.

01:33:03.169 --> 01:33:04.271
Hey, Jess.

01:33:05.338 --> 01:33:06.339
Hey, babe.

01:33:08.106 --> 01:33:10.142
It's good to see you.

01:33:22.088 --> 01:33:23.123
Martin!

01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:28.594
Martin!

01:33:30.996 --> 01:33:32.865
No.

01:33:34.066 --> 01:33:35.902
Please, Martin!

01:33:38.036 --> 01:33:39.505
I came back.

01:33:40.373 --> 01:33:41.374
I'm back.

01:33:54.486 --> 01:33:55.487
I'm done.

01:33:58.391 --> 01:34:01.358
I'm done. I'm done!

01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:02.429
Do you hear me?

01:34:04.396 --> 01:34:06.332
Come, take me!

01:34:08.433 --> 01:34:09.902
Take me!

01:34:34.493 --> 01:34:36.996
Come and get me.

01:34:49.342 --> 01:34:50.442
Martin.

01:34:56.348 --> 01:34:57.350
Oh, Martin.

01:34:58.351 --> 01:35:00.317
Oh, thank god. Let's go.

01:35:00.319 --> 01:35:01.321
Come on.

01:35:02.588 --> 01:35:04.557
I can't believe it.
You came back for me.

01:35:10.062 --> 01:35:11.064
Of course.

01:35:15.334 --> 01:35:16.766
We thought we'd lost you.

01:35:57.211 --> 01:36:02.211
