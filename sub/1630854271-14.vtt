00:06.881 --> 00:08.717
Hello, Camila.

00:08.758 --> 00:10.176
Oh, hey, John.

00:10.218 --> 00:11.344
How you doing?

00:11.386 --> 00:13.888
Great.
How's it going with you?

00:13.930 --> 00:17.851
Good.
Rehearsals going alright?

00:17.892 --> 00:19.310
Excellent.
How about you?

00:19.352 --> 00:21.312
Going great.
Cool. Cool.

00:21.354 --> 00:22.522
That's really cool.
Um...

00:22.564 --> 00:23.982
Three-way knockouts,
a lot of pressure.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.442
A lot of pressure.
Yeah.

00:25.483 --> 00:27.193
Is anybody standing out
or...

00:27.235 --> 00:28.403
Oh, they're all
standing out.

00:28.445 --> 00:30.071
Oh, that's cool.
Yeah.

00:30.113 --> 00:31.990
I wish you
all the best.

00:32.032 --> 00:34.868
I wish you...

00:34.909 --> 00:36.244
equally...

00:36.286 --> 00:37.954
the best.
Good luck.

00:37.996 --> 00:39.164
What's your
favorite performance?

00:39.205 --> 00:41.082
Don't worry about it.

00:41.124 --> 00:42.667
Three-way knockouts.

00:42.709 --> 00:43.752
It's gonna be good,

00:43.793 --> 00:48.381
but if I'm going
against Kim or Omar...

00:50.717 --> 00:53.678
First time on Team John,
which is super exciting.

00:53.720 --> 00:55.555
I'm super excited
to work with him.

00:55.597 --> 00:58.558
I'm super excited to find out
who my knockout partners are.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.435
It's scary, but it's awesome.

01:01.269 --> 01:03.229
John: Ian!
What's going on?

01:03.271 --> 01:04.898
Welcome to Team Legend.

01:04.939 --> 01:07.984
I'm so happy I stole
Ian from Team Gwen.

01:08.026 --> 01:09.402
And look who's with you.

01:09.444 --> 01:11.321
Hey!
Morgan!

01:11.363 --> 01:13.406
We got Ohio.
We got a Hoosier.

01:13.448 --> 01:15.158
Yeah. The Midwest.
Here we go.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.202
How are you?
Good to see you.

01:17.243 --> 01:18.745
Hey!
How are you?

01:18.787 --> 01:20.038
Good, how are you?

01:20.080 --> 01:22.165
This year, we're having
a three-way knockout.

01:22.207 --> 01:24.501
Let me bring out
our third artist.

01:24.542 --> 01:27.712
I'm scared.
I know. I'm nervous.

01:27.754 --> 01:30.048
What up?
Looky here!

01:30.090 --> 01:31.257
Let's go!

01:31.299 --> 01:32.717
Omar!
What is up?

01:32.759 --> 01:35.303
Omar.
That scares me a little bit.

01:35.345 --> 01:36.930
Good to see you.
Hey, bro.

01:36.971 --> 01:40.850
Omar's got a range that a lot of
males really can't compete with,

01:40.892 --> 01:45.522
and Morgan's voice is soft,
but it's so clearly spoken,

01:45.563 --> 01:47.107
and I'm definitely intimidated.

01:47.148 --> 01:50.276
This is our first time ever
having a three-way knockout.

01:50.318 --> 01:53.738
Only one of you can win
this knockout.

01:53.780 --> 01:57.450
I put you three together because
I have nine amazing singers,

01:57.492 --> 02:01.955
and I wanted to give each
of them an opportunity to shine,

02:01.996 --> 02:04.666
and this performance can get you
to the live rounds.

02:04.708 --> 02:06.793
I think your team is stacked.
It's stacked.

02:06.835 --> 02:09.129
John: It is stacked.
I feel very fortunate.

02:09.170 --> 02:10.714
But all that means is,

02:10.755 --> 02:12.424
let's do some steal-worthy
performances, too, you know?

02:12.465 --> 02:14.426
Right.
Absolutely.
Yeah. 100%.

02:14.467 --> 02:17.012
First time ever, this is
three-way knockout rounds.

02:17.053 --> 02:18.513
It's definitely a little scary.

02:18.555 --> 02:19.973
So what song
did you pick?

02:20.015 --> 02:22.350
I'm singing "Cough Syrup"
by Young the Giant.

02:22.392 --> 02:23.977
Okay.
And I chose this song

02:24.019 --> 02:25.770
'cause it's a really important
song to me,

02:25.812 --> 02:28.481
about the time that I really
decided I wanted to do music.

02:28.523 --> 02:30.525
After high school,
I started going to school

02:30.567 --> 02:32.527
and working at the same time.

02:32.569 --> 02:35.822
Eventually it just got old to
me, and I realized

02:35.864 --> 02:39.409
that I would never love anything
as much as music.

02:39.451 --> 02:42.954
* Life's too short
to even care at all *

02:42.996 --> 02:44.664
* Whoa *
Yeah.

02:44.706 --> 02:46.833
One of my fondest memories
with this song

02:46.875 --> 02:49.336
is a time
when my car broke down.

02:49.377 --> 02:51.755
I did not have the money
to fix it,

02:51.796 --> 02:53.506
so I dropped it off
at my parents'

02:53.548 --> 02:57.510
and I picked up their '95
Ford Ranger without a stereo,

02:57.552 --> 02:59.929
and I had my Bluetooth speaker
going down the highway,

02:59.971 --> 03:01.431
my windows down,

03:01.473 --> 03:04.642
and I remember screaming
this song at the top of my lungs

03:04.684 --> 03:06.853
and it giving me goose bumps
and being like,

03:06.895 --> 03:08.855
"Yeah, I still really
want to do this."

03:08.897 --> 03:12.108
* Restore life
the way it should be *

03:12.150 --> 03:14.069
* I'm waiting for *

03:14.110 --> 03:15.445
Ian is really good.

03:15.487 --> 03:17.322
He's got such a cool voice,
such a cool tone,

03:17.364 --> 03:18.782
and he's singing
a type of music

03:18.823 --> 03:21.242
that none of our other artists
are singing.

03:21.284 --> 03:22.619
He knows who he is as an artist.

03:22.660 --> 03:24.537
He's not trying
to be anybody else,

03:24.579 --> 03:26.706
and I think it's really
working for him.

03:26.748 --> 03:28.041
Beautiful!

03:28.083 --> 03:29.250
[ Applause ]
Morgan: Whoo!

03:29.292 --> 03:30.960
I love
this song for you.

03:31.002 --> 03:33.129
Thank you.
You just sound super, like,
in your pocket doing it.

03:33.171 --> 03:34.547
Thank you.

03:34.589 --> 03:35.965
The only thing I would say
is maybe just think about,

03:36.007 --> 03:37.717
how you're gonna look
when you perform.

03:37.759 --> 03:39.219
Yeah.
I just want you to, like,

03:39.260 --> 03:41.554
lean into being a-a rock star
a little bit.
Yeah.

03:41.596 --> 03:42.972
Part of it's wardrobe,

03:43.014 --> 03:45.392
but part of it's about
just carrying yourself in a way.

03:45.433 --> 03:46.559
Do you care if I, like,
move around a bit?

03:46.601 --> 03:47.977
Yeah. Move.
Alright.

03:48.019 --> 03:49.229
You can rock out.
Right.

03:49.270 --> 03:51.064
This song, it's, like,
made for you.

03:51.106 --> 03:52.982
Thank you.
Great job.

03:53.024 --> 03:54.567
Alright, Morgan.

03:54.609 --> 03:58.154
* I thought that
I didn't care *

03:58.196 --> 03:59.656
Yeah!

03:59.698 --> 04:02.701
Morgan's unique. She's soulful.
She's interesting.

04:02.742 --> 04:04.202
How are you?

04:04.244 --> 04:05.995
I'm good.
How are you?
Good.

04:06.037 --> 04:07.580
I'm excited.
I'm excited!

04:07.622 --> 04:10.834
She does some things you might
not expect as an artist,

04:10.875 --> 04:11.876
and I think that's cool.

04:11.918 --> 04:13.670
I want to know what
you picked.

04:13.712 --> 04:15.588
I'm singing, "I Got You
(I Feel Good)" by James Brown.

04:15.630 --> 04:17.298
James Brown?
Mm-hmm.

04:17.340 --> 04:19.426
The girl is so badass.
I know.

04:19.467 --> 04:21.511
So are you gonna do it
in the style of James Brown,

04:21.553 --> 04:23.138
or are you gonna
do it differently?

04:23.179 --> 04:24.931
There's a little bit of
an adjustment in the beginning.

04:24.973 --> 04:27.851
* I feel good *

04:27.892 --> 04:30.937
* I knew that I would now,
yeah *

04:30.979 --> 04:32.313
Yeah.

04:32.355 --> 04:35.900
The lyrics represent how I feel
when I'm performing,

04:35.942 --> 04:39.779
and truly, the anxieties
and fears vanish.

04:39.821 --> 04:41.281
Hey!
Hey!

04:41.322 --> 04:42.907
I'm so grateful to be here.

04:42.949 --> 04:45.618
Three years ago,
I could have never dreamed

04:45.660 --> 04:47.579
of doing something like this.

04:47.620 --> 04:51.708
* I know that I can't
do no wrong *

04:51.750 --> 04:55.253
In high school,
I was very to myself

04:55.295 --> 04:57.964
as, like,
a protective mechanism.

04:58.006 --> 05:00.383
But in college
at Belmont University,

05:00.425 --> 05:02.844
where I'm majoring
in commercial music voice

05:02.886 --> 05:04.637
with an emphasis in songwriting,

05:04.679 --> 05:08.808
I met some of my most
amazing friends,

05:08.850 --> 05:10.643
and their encouragement
and support

05:10.685 --> 05:12.562
are the reason why I'm here.

05:12.604 --> 05:16.483
* So good,
I got you, babe *

05:16.524 --> 05:18.610
That really works.

05:18.651 --> 05:20.153
What a bold choice.
Right?

05:20.195 --> 05:23.823
It's, like, a little more sultry
and sexy than James' version.

05:23.865 --> 05:26.451
Yeah.
And I think
it really works for your voice.

05:26.493 --> 05:28.161
Okay.
I have no criticism.

05:28.203 --> 05:30.080
It feels like that's the way
it should be done.
Okay.

05:30.121 --> 05:32.374
If you're gonna sing it, this
is the way to sing it, you know?

05:32.415 --> 05:35.960
There's, like, the
* When I hold you in my arms *

05:36.002 --> 05:38.088
that's, like, a higher part
in my register.

05:38.129 --> 05:40.006
I don't know if I want
to lean it back,

05:40.048 --> 05:41.883
but still give it
a little bit of grit?

05:41.925 --> 05:43.843
In general, I like
the sultry approach,

05:43.885 --> 05:45.720
but I think
it would be cool to like,

05:45.762 --> 05:48.807
elevate it and, like,
break it just a little bit.
Yeah. Absolutely, yeah.

05:48.848 --> 05:51.768
But it has to feel,
like, confident and
it has to feel like --

05:51.810 --> 05:54.688
I think you can do it,
so I think it's worth trying.

05:54.729 --> 05:57.148
Okay.
John:
Morgan threw me a curveball.

05:57.190 --> 06:01.069
It's always interesting taking
on such a distinctive artist.

06:01.111 --> 06:03.530
I feel like she sounds
more confident and cooler

06:03.571 --> 06:04.864
than she's ever sounded.

06:04.906 --> 06:06.658
I think she's doing
the right thing.

06:06.700 --> 06:09.369
Being yourself is the best way
to nail any song, you know?
Yes. Yeah.

06:09.411 --> 06:11.538
This song,
more so than my other songs,

06:11.579 --> 06:12.997

of, like, Morgan

19:50.732 --> 19:54.235
* They always wanna come,
but they never wanna leave *

19:54.277 --> 19:56.905
* My exes *

19:56.946 --> 20:00.033
Eric, you're easily
one of the best performers

20:00.075 --> 20:02.327
and entertainers of this season.

20:02.369 --> 20:04.120
The winner of this knockout
is Eric.

20:04.162 --> 20:05.497
Eric is so special.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.791
We want to hear
incredible voices,

20:07.832 --> 20:10.710
and we also love
dance and acting,

20:10.752 --> 20:13.630
and Eric has
all of those things.

20:13.672 --> 20:15.382
We party on, baby.
Whew!

20:15.423 --> 20:17.592
I can't wait
for people to see more of him.

20:17.634 --> 20:19.469
A star was born.
Yeah.

20:19.511 --> 20:20.637
I should have said that.
That was special.

20:20.679 --> 20:22.389
Yeah, it was special.

20:29.187 --> 20:31.022
* This is "The Voice" *

20:31.064 --> 20:33.358
Daly: Welcome back.

20:33.400 --> 20:34.776
Blake: Come on in.

20:34.818 --> 20:37.362
Hey!
What's up, Blake?
How you doing, man?

20:37.404 --> 20:39.030
You know this person?
Hi!

20:39.072 --> 20:41.032
Oh, my goodness, Kate.

20:41.074 --> 20:43.576
All day I had it in my head
that I was gonna be against

20:43.618 --> 20:45.745
Eva and The Dryes
for some reason.

20:45.787 --> 20:47.539
And then I see Jay there.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.374
I did not expect you
to be out here.
I didn't expect
that at all.

20:49.416 --> 20:50.709
He was in shock, too.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.544
We were just looking
at each other like,

20:52.585 --> 20:54.129
"Oh. What? This is weird."

20:54.170 --> 20:56.006
I'm pretty sure there's
supposed to be three of you.

20:56.047 --> 20:57.048
Where's the other one?

20:57.090 --> 20:58.717
Ahh!
How we doing, guys?
Oh, Bryce.

20:58.758 --> 21:00.719
Bryce: Going into this knockout
with Jay and Kate,

21:00.760 --> 21:02.178
it's gonna be an
incredible competition.

21:02.220 --> 21:04.431
I think that it's gonna be
a hell of a show.

21:04.472 --> 21:06.016
When they threw this idea
at me

21:06.057 --> 21:08.935
that we're gonna be doing
three-way knockouts,

21:08.977 --> 21:13.773
this is easily the hardest thing
they've ever thrown at us,

21:13.815 --> 21:15.483
especially with you three.

21:15.525 --> 21:17.027
This is an interesting group,

21:17.068 --> 21:20.864
because you have Bryce,
who's hardcore country.

21:20.905 --> 21:22.949
Every time you sing,
you're going against two people.

21:22.991 --> 21:25.076
What is that?
I'm a veteran out here,
must be.

21:25.118 --> 21:26.286
And you have Kate.

21:26.327 --> 21:28.288
She can do the pop thing
as good as anybody.

21:28.329 --> 21:31.374
I had to pull out every trick
to get Kate on my team.

21:31.416 --> 21:32.625
[ Laughter ]

21:32.667 --> 21:34.252
You really are
muting her!

21:34.294 --> 21:35.545
[ Bleats ]

21:35.587 --> 21:37.213
My hometown girl
right here, you know?

21:37.255 --> 21:38.465
Yeah.

21:38.506 --> 21:40.008
And, dude, I mean,
you're my new guy.

21:40.050 --> 21:42.010
Almost got me divorced
from my wife, for God's sakes.

21:42.052 --> 21:43.928
Oh, shoot.
I had a really awkward moment
with my wife

21:43.970 --> 21:46.765
in the battle rounds
because of Jay.

21:46.806 --> 21:49.726
She tried to use her save...
Daly: Whoa, Jay!

21:49.768 --> 21:51.978
...and I used my steal.

21:52.020 --> 21:53.605
No!
Oh, no!

21:53.646 --> 21:55.857
Using his
one and only steal!

21:55.899 --> 21:58.777
There was a huge part of me
that thought

21:58.818 --> 22:00.945
Jay would never leave
his home team.

22:00.987 --> 22:02.405
Please forgive me,
but I think

22:02.447 --> 22:04.115
I'm gonna
go with your husband.

22:04.157 --> 22:06.618
Ohh! I stole him!

22:06.659 --> 22:07.952
Blake:
What are you gonna be singing?

22:07.994 --> 22:09.996
This is actually one
of my favorite songs.

22:10.038 --> 22:11.581
It correlates
to my life perfectly,

22:11.623 --> 22:12.916
'cause I'm marrying
the girl of my dreams

22:12.957 --> 22:14.626
in a few weeks, actually.
No kidding?

22:14.668 --> 22:17.712
For the knockouts, I am singing
"Prayed For You" by Matt Stell,

22:17.754 --> 22:19.422
and I'm so pumped.

22:19.464 --> 22:21.216
* Every single day *

22:21.257 --> 22:24.594
I've prayed for years for God
to bring me a life partner.

22:24.636 --> 22:26.137
* But I prayed for you *

22:26.179 --> 22:28.807
Now I'm about to get married
to the love of my life.

22:28.848 --> 22:30.141
I want to dedicate
this performance to you,

22:30.183 --> 22:32.310
if that's okay.
<i>Oh, my gosh, yes.</i>

22:32.352 --> 22:33.978
<i>You know how much</i>
<i>I love that song.</i>

22:34.020 --> 22:36.648
When my mom passed away,
Kylie was my rock.

22:36.690 --> 22:38.692
If I didn't have her,
I'm not sure

22:38.733 --> 22:40.318
I would have made it
through the last few years.

22:40.360 --> 22:42.028
<i>You're still gonna make it</i>
<i>to our wedding, right?</i>

22:42.070 --> 22:43.655
[ Laughs ]

22:43.697 --> 22:46.866
* Kept my faith
like that old King James *

22:46.908 --> 22:49.661
Blake: I think the thing
that makes Jay so special

22:49.703 --> 22:52.956
is how serious
he takes his performances.

22:52.997 --> 22:55.417
He loves music,
and that really comes through.

22:55.458 --> 22:58.503
* I prayed for you *

22:58.545 --> 23:00.714
Wow.
[ Applause ]

23:00.755 --> 23:02.382
Bryce: Jay --
he's that radio voice, man.

23:02.424 --> 23:05.301
He's a very, very,
very talented country artist.

23:05.343 --> 23:06.678
Yeah, he's good.
He's great.

23:06.720 --> 23:08.513
The way he sang it
was incredible.

23:08.555 --> 23:10.348
First of all,
you have super talent,

23:10.390 --> 23:14.436
and there's no reason
why you can't have
a big hit right now...

23:14.477 --> 23:15.687
Thank you.
...be a star and all that.

23:15.729 --> 23:17.480
I would say
the only thing,

23:17.522 --> 23:19.691
there's so much joy
in this song

23:19.733 --> 23:22.360
and I feel like you're
performing it so intensely.

23:22.402 --> 23:23.695
You don't seem open.

23:23.737 --> 23:25.655
You just seem like,
"Rrr, I'm singing.

23:25.697 --> 23:28.116
This is my song.
This is my moment."

23:28.158 --> 23:31.119
I want to see you happy, too,
when you're doing it, you know?
Yeah.

23:31.161 --> 23:33.163
He prayed for this
person to come in his life

23:33.204 --> 23:35.999
and he got the person that
he felt like God sent to him.

23:36.041 --> 23:37.417
You're about to
marry her.

23:37.459 --> 23:40.295
And, yeah, that's emotional,
but at the end of the day,

23:40.337 --> 23:42.589
you got what you wanted and
there's some joy in that.

23:42.630 --> 23:43.965
Yeah.

23:44.007 --> 23:45.759
I've worked a really long time
to get here

23:45.800 --> 23:47.302
and to have this opportunity,

23:47.344 --> 23:50.055
so it's okay to be happy,
and this is an opportunity

23:50.096 --> 23:52.223
to share that joy and happiness
with everyone else.

23:52.265 --> 23:54.893
Hey, yeah, go get a beer.
That's so good, man.

23:54.934 --> 23:57.645
Alright, what are you doing?
Stop joking around, everybody.

23:57.687 --> 24:00.023
Oh, my God.
This is not an easy song.

24:00.065 --> 24:01.274
No, it's not.

24:01.316 --> 24:03.360
I'm singing "Colder Weather"
by Zac Brown Band.

24:03.401 --> 24:05.737
* She'd trade Colorado *

24:05.779 --> 24:07.739
* If he'd take her
with him *

24:07.781 --> 24:09.199
Listened to the song
growing up,

24:09.240 --> 24:11.034
and I've always felt
emotionally tied to this song.

24:11.076 --> 24:14.079
* She's answered by
the taillights *

24:14.120 --> 24:17.248
* Shining through
the windowpane *

24:17.290 --> 24:20.001
Growing up couldn't
have been better.

24:20.043 --> 24:21.586
Yeah.

24:21.628 --> 24:23.546
Me and my father,
we're almost too close.

24:23.588 --> 24:25.674
He's the best role model
a kid could have.

24:25.715 --> 24:26.925
I can only imagine
how hard it is

24:26.966 --> 24:28.927
to raise little ol' knucklehead
me.

24:28.968 --> 24:31.888
* But I'm stuck in
colder weather *

24:31.930 --> 24:34.432
Being out here in L.A.,
man, you just --

24:34.474 --> 24:37.143
You connect so much to the song
'cause you long for home.

24:37.185 --> 24:39.646
You long for your friends,
your family.

24:39.688 --> 24:41.064
It can be very lonely,

24:41.106 --> 24:44.651
but sacrificing that
to make my family proud

24:44.693 --> 24:46.194
makes me understand
why I'm out here.

24:46.236 --> 24:49.447
* But I'm stuck
in colder weather *

24:49.489 --> 24:52.826
Blake:
Bryce is one of those artists
that, as a country fan,

24:52.867 --> 24:54.744
you're always excited
to see come along.

24:54.786 --> 24:55.954
He's the real deal.

24:55.995 --> 24:57.789
I mean, he's -- he is solid,

24:57.831 --> 25:00.959
hardcore country,
and he's proud of it.

25:01.001 --> 25:03.878
* Born for leaving *

25:03.920 --> 25:06.089
Kate: Whoo!
Man. Really good.

25:06.131 --> 25:07.716
Did y'all know
he could do that?

25:07.757 --> 25:09.843
I don't know till just then,
so it's okay.

25:09.884 --> 25:12.053
This is a tough song,
and Bryce is not

25:12.095 --> 25:13.722
shying away from jumping in.

25:13.763 --> 25:16.808
It's really impressive what
he's doing in these rehearsals.

25:16.850 --> 25:18.601
The -- The only real note
I had --

25:18.643 --> 25:20.729
I felt like
the beginning of the song,

25:20.770 --> 25:22.897
I heard a little bit
of pitchy stuff.

25:22.939 --> 25:24.482
I can fix that.
You're so good, dude.

25:24.524 --> 25:27.360
Too good to let a pitch thing
be a problem.
Thank you.

25:27.402 --> 25:29.320
You just got to have
a game plan on...
That's it.

25:29.362 --> 25:32.157
...where to breathe and get
as much out of it as you can.

25:32.198 --> 25:34.325
Go big or go home, man.
That's the thing.
That's right.

25:34.367 --> 25:37.495
This three-way knockout,
it is extremely stressful.

25:37.537 --> 25:40.999
[ Sighs ]
Me and two country guys,
so I'm like, ahh.

25:41.041 --> 25:42.834
But I want to prove to Blake

25:42.876 --> 25:45.545
that there's more to me
than he has seen so far,

25:45.587 --> 25:46.838
give him a reason to pick me,

25:46.880 --> 25:49.257
the pop artist,
over the country guys.

25:49.299 --> 25:51.885
I'm singing "Anyone"
by Justin Bieber.

25:51.926 --> 25:54.471
And I chose it because I,
first of all,

25:54.512 --> 25:57.140
wanted to show that I'm, like,
in the pop genre.

25:57.182 --> 26:00.143
Yeah.
And also, it's a little bit
challenging to sing.

26:00.185 --> 26:02.854
More challenging than I realized
when I picked it.

26:02.896 --> 26:04.314
It reminds me
of my husband,

26:04.356 --> 26:06.191
so it's like,
a sweet love song.

26:06.232 --> 26:08.360
I'm excited to hear it,
then.

26:08.401 --> 26:13.073
* You are the only one
I'll ever love *

26:13.114 --> 26:15.325
My husband, he's the one
who showed me the song.

26:15.367 --> 26:17.994
The song really just reminds me
of how much I love him.

26:18.036 --> 26:20.372
He was the first person
to really push me

26:20.413 --> 26:21.956
to sing outside of church,

26:21.998 --> 26:23.750
paid for my first
studio session.

26:23.792 --> 26:25.460
He tells me
I need to dream bigger.

26:25.502 --> 26:29.047
He's the reason I'm here, and
part of every dream that I have.

26:29.089 --> 26:34.719
* You are the only one
I'll ever love *

26:34.761 --> 26:37.347
This is one of those songs,
I wish I could have written it,

26:37.389 --> 26:39.808
because it feels like
it came from my heart.

26:39.849 --> 26:41.476
So incredible.
Wow. That was good.

26:41.518 --> 26:44.771
I'm always nervous
switching into falsetto

26:44.813 --> 26:46.564
when you're already
up there.

26:46.606 --> 26:47.982
Yeah.
When you're going for

26:48.024 --> 26:49.734
something big and you
switch over into it,

26:49.776 --> 26:52.946
it just literally doesn't have
the impact it does...
Yeah, okay.

26:52.987 --> 26:55.198
...when you hit something
full voice and hold it.

26:55.240 --> 26:57.701
Do you think I should try to do
that whole chorus full voice?

26:57.742 --> 26:59.077
Yes.
Okay.

26:59.119 --> 27:00.829
I think I hesitate
'cause I always feel like

27:00.870 --> 27:02.747
I sound nasal
for some reason.

27:02.789 --> 27:04.290
I love nasal.
Okay.

27:04.332 --> 27:06.418
Yeah, I'm a country singer,
though.
Yeah. Yeah.

27:06.459 --> 27:09.587
Okay.
I just need to embrace it.
Yeah.

27:09.629 --> 27:11.089
She definitely handed herself

27:11.131 --> 27:13.258
a huge challenge
by picking this song.

27:13.299 --> 27:16.261
She seems like somebody that
wants to keep pushing herself

27:16.302 --> 27:19.639
so that you're continuously
shocked by how talented she is,

27:19.681 --> 27:20.849
and it's working.

27:20.890 --> 27:22.267
Y'all want to
come up here?

27:22.308 --> 27:24.769
I can't think of anybody else
on this season

27:24.811 --> 27:26.563
that has a sound like Kate.

27:26.604 --> 27:27.897
She's gonna be tough to beat.

27:27.939 --> 27:29.107
You're all great singers.

27:29.149 --> 27:30.650
You're at the top of your game

27:30.692 --> 27:32.527
when it comes
to being vocalists...
Thank you.

27:32.569 --> 27:33.695
...so leave it all out here.

27:33.737 --> 27:35.280
Remember, there's a steal.

27:35.321 --> 27:36.865
He can tell you about
those steals.

27:36.906 --> 27:38.742
Oh, yeah.
They're a good thing, right?

27:38.783 --> 27:40.118
Oh, yeah.

27:40.160 --> 27:41.453
These three artists
all really want this,

and it makes my decision
even harder.

Coaching and rehearsals
is my favorite part of the show.

John: It's so fun.

27:56.593 --> 27:58.345
Besides putting my makeup on.
I don't know about y'all,

27:58.386 --> 28:00.347
but my teams were
really good in rehearsal.

28:00.388 --> 28:02.098
I have a feeling mine
was better.

John: Than ours?
Yeah.

28:03.558 --> 28:04.642
Oh.

28:04.684 --> 28:06.186
Sometimes somebody picks
an amazing song

28:06.227 --> 28:08.188
and you're like,
"You're smart."

28:08.229 --> 28:09.522
If they're picking
really good songs,

28:09.564 --> 28:10.982
they understand
who they are as an artist.

28:11.024 --> 28:12.359
Yeah,
it's the overall package.

28:12.400 --> 28:14.027
Blake:
Here we come, America!

strong enough to make him stay *

You're one of my favorite
voices of the whole season.

When you do a song
by a male vocalist,

35:32.799 --> 35:34.634
like,
you have to really adapt it,

35:34.676 --> 35:37.846
but you did it in such
a tasteful and emotional way.

35:37.887 --> 35:39.222
Thank you.

35:39.264 --> 35:42.100
Just the feeling that you put
behind every word...

35:42.142 --> 35:44.811
your performance
was really beautiful.
[ Laughing ] Oh, God.

35:44.853 --> 35:47.856
Jay, it seemed like something
was going wrong.

35:47.897 --> 35:49.691
Yeah, I got a little
overwhelmed, 'cause my fiancée

35:49.733 --> 35:51.401
is in the audience
right behind you,

35:51.443 --> 35:52.986
so I was almost crying.

Yes, ma'am.

36:01.578 --> 36:03.246
I'm such a fan of yours.

36:03.288 --> 36:06.541
Thank you.
It's a combination of, like,
your name and your voice,

36:06.583 --> 36:07.751
and you've got,
like, the iconic,

36:07.792 --> 36:09.336
like,
the shadow of the hat.

36:09.377 --> 36:10.545
That's country
right there.

36:10.587 --> 36:12.172
I just really like you.

36:12.213 --> 36:13.381
Thank you so much.

36:13.423 --> 36:14.883
We all know that I love Jay.

36:14.924 --> 36:16.885
He was on my team. He left me.

36:16.926 --> 36:19.721
So that was really
emotional for me.

36:19.763 --> 36:21.222
Camila: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:21.264 --> 36:22.849
But I love this song
for you.

36:22.891 --> 36:26.394
You feel like a true artist,
and I think you're super gifted.

36:26.436 --> 36:29.356
Kate, you blew me away today.

36:29.397 --> 36:30.690
Oh, wow.
It was so powerful.

36:30.732 --> 36:31.983
It was so emotional.

36:32.025 --> 36:33.485
If I were gonna
choose somebody,

36:33.526 --> 36:36.071
I would choose Kate
in this knockout.

36:36.112 --> 36:37.781
Thank you so much.

36:37.822 --> 36:41.576
Bryce, your voice is warm
and inviting.

36:41.618 --> 36:42.869
I did hear
some pitchiness,

36:42.911 --> 36:44.829
but it didn't really
distract me a lot,

36:44.871 --> 36:47.874
because you came out with
that quiet sense of assuredness

36:47.916 --> 36:49.250
that I like to see
in an artist.

36:49.292 --> 36:50.502
Thank you so much.

36:50.543 --> 36:52.837
And, Kate, whew,
what a revelation.

36:52.879 --> 36:55.131
That was my favorite performance
of yours.

36:55.173 --> 36:58.885
I'm saying, Blake, you gotta go
with the girl from Oklahoma.

36:58.927 --> 37:01.513
Daly: Thank you, Coaches.
Kate: Thank you, John.

37:01.554 --> 37:02.764
Alright, Blake, before
we find out your winner,

37:02.806 --> 37:04.265
tell us some thoughts.

37:04.307 --> 37:06.101
Bryce, you have
the greatest gift of all,

37:06.142 --> 37:08.228
which is, you really
don't have to do anything

37:08.269 --> 37:10.230
and people just like you.
[ Laughter ]

37:10.271 --> 37:13.775
But, man, I'm a fan of your
singing, and the pitchy stuff,

37:13.817 --> 37:16.277
if we reset you
and you did it over again,

37:16.319 --> 37:18.029
you'd probably nail it.

37:18.071 --> 37:19.906
And I could say the same thing
about Jay right now,

37:19.948 --> 37:21.825
who I know
is probably kicking himself

37:21.866 --> 37:24.953
for even looking up in that
direction, you know?

37:24.994 --> 37:26.955
And then, Kate,
this is exciting, huh?

37:26.996 --> 37:28.790
To hear everybody
freaking out.

37:28.832 --> 37:31.126
I mean, look at Camila.
She pointed at you just then.

37:31.167 --> 37:34.129
She's doing the heart thing.
John loved it.

37:34.170 --> 37:35.463
John hates everything.

37:35.505 --> 37:37.465
Oh, my God.
[ Laughs ]

Daly:
Blake, the time has come.

37:38.925 --> 37:41.261
Who is the winner of this
three-way knockout?

37:41.302 --> 37:45.306
I've been doing this
a long time, this show.

37:45.348 --> 37:47.017
**

37:47.058 --> 37:52.147
It's not that often I get to
play a hand like this, uh...

37:52.188 --> 37:54.983
but I'm gonna roll the dice
right now.

37:55.025 --> 37:58.486
The winner
of this knockout...

37:58.528 --> 38:00.196
is Bryce.

Gwen: Oh, whoa!

38:01.531 --> 38:03.199
Daly: Bryce wins...
Oh, my goodness.

38:03.241 --> 38:05.493
...and moves on
to the live playoffs!

38:05.535 --> 38:07.287
Congratulations!

38:07.328 --> 38:08.747
Congrats, Bryce!

38:08.788 --> 38:10.498
Blake: I had to pick Bryce.
He's the real deal.

38:10.540 --> 38:11.916
He's as country as they get,

38:11.958 --> 38:13.835
and I know exactly
how to work with that guy.

38:13.877 --> 38:15.545
You look like you got
a pony for Christmas.

38:15.587 --> 38:16.755
I know! [ Laughs ]

38:16.796 --> 38:18.006
Bryce is one of those artists

38:18.048 --> 38:19.424
that I think's
gonna go all the way.

38:19.466 --> 38:20.633
Congratulations.
Thank you, man.

38:20.675 --> 38:22.093
He connects with people.

38:22.135 --> 38:25.555
People love him.
He's ready for these lives.

38:25.597 --> 38:28.558
I'm just blessed.
Let's go. Let's do it.

38:28.600 --> 38:31.561
Daly: That leaves these two
artists available to steal.

38:31.603 --> 38:33.605
Jay, anything you want
to say to Blake?

38:33.646 --> 38:36.441
Blake, it is rare
that I get flustered,

38:36.483 --> 38:37.942
but she overwhelmed me.

38:37.984 --> 38:40.028
It was actually
a beautiful moment for me.
Aww.

38:40.070 --> 38:41.529
And to have her face
in the crowd

38:41.571 --> 38:44.532
is more than worth it for me,
so thanks for having me.

38:44.574 --> 38:48.244
Daly: Give it up for Jay Allen,
ladies and gentlemen!

38:48.286 --> 38:49.662

38:57.253 --> 38:59.255
Coaches, let me remind you that
Kate is available to steal.

38:59.297 --> 39:01.132
Kate, what would you like
to say to your coach?

39:01.174 --> 39:03.802
Blake, than you for believing
in me. Thank you [laughs]

39:03.843 --> 39:07.764
[ Whoosh ]
That's the sound of a steal!
Times two!

39:07.806 --> 39:09.683
That's what I was waiting for,
right there.

39:09.724 --> 39:11.643
What's gonna happen?

39:11.685 --> 39:12.977
John,
you hit your button first.

39:13.019 --> 39:14.771
Why do you want Kate
to join your team?

39:14.813 --> 39:18.274
I did hit my button first, Kate.
I did. I did.

39:18.316 --> 39:21.236
It seems, Kate,
that Blake, he has no save,

39:21.277 --> 39:24.197
and he knew that one of us
would want to steal you and...
