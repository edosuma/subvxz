WEBVTT

00:15.724 --> 00:16.933
Skadoosh.

00:26.526 --> 00:27.569
Ow!

00:27.652 --> 00:28.903
What now, Zhen?

00:28.987 --> 00:31.948
Cramp! Do you think
it's 'cause I'm working too hard?

00:32.032 --> 00:35.076
It's only midday. Now, finish your scroll.

00:35.160 --> 00:39.330
But I'm so tired!
And I'm done with this one.

00:39.414 --> 00:41.291
Then put it in the library.

01:07.567 --> 01:10.862
-Contain yourself, dear Veruca.

01:11.362 --> 01:12.739
We got the scroll.

01:21.206 --> 01:26.503
Think how fun it'll be to see
these giant rocks fall like dominos!

01:26.586 --> 01:29.506
-Smashed to little bits, bits, bits!

01:32.967 --> 01:34.636
-Po?

01:35.220 --> 01:37.639
It's the thumb! It's awake!

02:16.886 --> 02:20.181
Leave it! There's no time
to pick up your miserable junk.

02:20.682 --> 02:22.267
Not junk.

02:30.441 --> 02:33.194
-The petal! Oh, the petal!

02:33.278 --> 02:35.738
-It's going to fall!

02:36.698 --> 02:39.325
-That thing's coming down!

02:42.287 --> 02:44.414
-Hold on!
-It's gonna fall! It's gonna fall!

02:44.497 --> 02:46.666
Blade, let's ride!

02:46.749 --> 02:47.876
Whoa!

02:47.959 --> 02:48.877
I gotcha, buddy!

02:48.960 --> 02:52.297
-Ow, ow, ow!
-Thanks, Dragon Master.

02:52.380 --> 02:54.841
Heads up, people! Whoa.

02:59.762 --> 03:01.264
Thanks, Dragon Master!

03:04.767 --> 03:07.270
Don't worry. I got this!

03:09.439 --> 03:11.107
Ska…

03:20.992 --> 03:23.494
Was your plan to punch through the stone?

03:24.245 --> 03:25.788
I mean, uh…

03:26.664 --> 03:27.832
Could have worked.

03:28.416 --> 03:29.459
Yay!

03:29.542 --> 03:32.795
-You did it! Hurrah!
-Our scrolls are saved!

03:34.339 --> 03:35.381
I'm Elder Huang.

03:36.132 --> 03:40.261
We monks are the keepers of these scrolls,
which hold all of China's history.

03:40.345 --> 03:43.640
We owe you a debt of gratitude
for saving them.

03:43.723 --> 03:46.893
And us, Dragon Master.

03:48.728 --> 03:50.396
Ah, thanks, but you know,

03:50.480 --> 03:53.566
the Emperor sort of took away
my Dragon Mastery.

03:53.650 --> 03:57.070
Your devotion and service to China
is well-documented.

04:05.328 --> 04:07.580
And we will not soon forget.

04:07.664 --> 04:09.374
Emperors come and go,

04:09.457 --> 04:13.378
but you are our Dragon Master.

04:13.461 --> 04:15.338
You're a legend.

04:15.421 --> 04:18.091
Uh, did you hear that? "Legend."

04:18.174 --> 04:20.802
Yes. It's similar to the word "myth."

04:20.885 --> 04:24.055
And who's this? Your apprentice?

04:25.223 --> 04:28.268
Uh, sorry about that.
She's got a little bit of a throat thing.

04:28.351 --> 04:32.563
I'm actually her apprentice.
Her page. I'm training to be a knight.

04:32.647 --> 04:36.401
My!
The Dragon Master, humble as ever.

04:37.151 --> 04:38.486
Did you see who did this?

04:38.569 --> 04:41.239
See them? We caught them red-handed.

04:43.408 --> 04:45.034
Klaus and Veruca.

04:45.535 --> 04:49.664
Everything is taken care of.
The Imperial Guard is on their way.

04:52.292 --> 04:56.421
W-W-We just need a minute with them,
if that's cool with you, your Elderness.

04:56.504 --> 04:58.047
Well…

04:58.131 --> 05:01.426
Alright then, Dragon Master.

05:14.439 --> 05:15.523
Whoa!

05:35.752 --> 05:38.421
This is gonna be awesome.

05:53.102 --> 05:54.437
Sweet!

06:38.856 --> 06:41.984
-That's gonna leave a mark.
-Get off me!

06:42.068 --> 06:45.321
-Would you get off me? Get off!

06:45.404 --> 06:47.156
-This way.
-Get off!

06:51.828 --> 06:54.497
Head is…

06:56.374 --> 06:57.375
This is it.

06:57.917 --> 07:00.545
-Finally, I have them.

07:01.838 --> 07:03.631
Hey. They're in a cage.

07:03.714 --> 07:05.675
We finally caught her in the act.

07:06.509 --> 07:08.052
S-Sorry. "Her"?

07:08.636 --> 07:09.470
Zhen.

07:10.888 --> 07:15.017
Why'd you put a sheet on the crate?
Now my eyes hurt from the light.

07:15.685 --> 07:19.147
You've caught the wrong person.

07:19.230 --> 07:22.775
Nonsense! She's been
a quill in our sides for years.

07:22.859 --> 07:25.862
Complaining, lying, setting off fireworks!

07:25.945 --> 07:28.281
But we finally caught her in the act.

07:28.364 --> 07:31.701
I'm sorry, you believe fireworks
caused a crater that size?

07:31.784 --> 07:35.538
Well, c-clearly her sparklers
and poppers were a gateway to…

07:35.621 --> 07:36.539
that!

07:36.622 --> 07:38.082
I told you, it wasn't me!

07:38.166 --> 07:39.959
I didn't do any of those things.

07:40.042 --> 07:42.837
I don't even know
what a firewor-firework is!

07:42.920 --> 07:45.673
Fireworks? Is that how you say it?
Never heard of 'em.

07:45.756 --> 07:49.802
Aw, you poor, innocent,
little spiky monk-person!

07:49.886 --> 07:51.637
-We're leaving.

07:53.806 --> 07:57.435
You shouldn't let your apprentice
disrespect you like that.

07:57.518 --> 08:00.897
-Oh, uh, she just drank some bad tea.

08:00.980 --> 08:02.356
Let me talk to her.

08:06.152 --> 08:07.820
Blade, wait.

08:07.904 --> 08:09.530
She's innocent.

08:09.614 --> 08:12.783
Of course she is, but these monks
clearly want to get rid of her,

08:12.867 --> 08:15.244
and no one even saw Klaus and Veruca!

08:15.328 --> 08:16.537
I saw them.

08:20.541 --> 08:23.127
Two weasels? Big, glowing glove thing?

08:23.211 --> 08:25.630
What were they doing?
Did you see where they went?

08:28.591 --> 08:30.718
Yes. I'll tell you everything.

08:30.801 --> 08:33.429
But first, you gotta bust me outta here.

08:33.513 --> 08:36.557
Like, with a series of appeals
to the high hedgehog court?

08:36.641 --> 08:37.475
Done.

08:38.476 --> 08:39.310
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:39.393 --> 08:42.146
Back the cart up! That's a crime!

08:42.230 --> 08:43.689
Not really. She's innocent.

08:43.773 --> 08:44.941
They don't know that!

08:45.024 --> 08:48.110
These monks are the only people
in China who still trust me,

08:48.194 --> 08:50.321
but not if we break
their prisoner out of jail!

08:50.404 --> 08:53.407
Being a knight means
making difficult choices.

08:53.491 --> 08:58.412
Leaving her in jail means Klaus and Veruca
will destroy another city, and another.

08:58.496 --> 09:02.375
You must learn to choose
the lesser of two evils.

09:02.458 --> 09:04.126
So, choose.

09:06.003 --> 09:06.837
Hm…

09:09.840 --> 09:10.675
Hm…

09:16.847 --> 09:19.058
Fine.

09:21.978 --> 09:24.730
We break you out,
you help us find those weasels.

09:39.495 --> 09:41.706
Blade, wait up! Blade!

10:01.517 --> 10:04.770
Vault to the cave,
take out the guards, and free Zhen.

10:04.854 --> 10:05.813
I'm getting the cart.

10:05.896 --> 10:08.566
No way. I'm not fighting monks.

10:08.649 --> 10:12.111
I'm trying to earn my title back,
not get on China's Most Wanted list.

10:12.194 --> 10:13.195
Then be clever.

10:13.279 --> 10:15.531
I don't care how you free her,
just free her.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.408
You said you wanted to be my page?

10:17.491 --> 10:19.410
Well, it's time to start acting like one.

10:27.293 --> 10:30.171
Alright, Po.
You can do this. Nice and quiet.

10:30.254 --> 10:32.506
No one will ever know it was you.

10:33.424 --> 10:36.886
I am the giant pole thingy.

10:36.969 --> 10:38.888
I am the giant pole thing.

10:42.016 --> 10:44.226
Ow, ow, ow!

10:45.436 --> 10:48.022
Okay, maybe a running start.

11:03.954 --> 11:06.040
-Whoa!

11:06.123 --> 11:08.125
No, no, no!

11:21.138 --> 11:22.973
Come on, Po. You got this.

11:25.059 --> 11:27.812
You are the giant pole thingy.

11:35.569 --> 11:39.115
-I'll never get used to this!

11:41.992 --> 11:45.746
This giant pole thingy is, uh,
kinda rough on the old nose.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.385
Okay. You got this.

11:59.468 --> 12:00.970
You can break someone out of jail

12:01.053 --> 12:04.265
and potentially break the hearts
of the only people who believe in you.

12:05.307 --> 12:07.977
"Remember, it's the lesser of two evils."

12:08.060 --> 12:09.061
I know.

12:09.145 --> 12:11.063
"For Queen and country!"

12:19.697 --> 12:21.073
-Sh!

12:42.887 --> 12:44.346
-What?

12:47.808 --> 12:48.976
Oh, right, right.

12:49.059 --> 12:50.436
Stealth mode.

12:50.519 --> 12:52.021
-Okay.

12:52.104 --> 12:53.522
Just gonna…

12:56.567 --> 12:58.402
-I don't know what the…

12:58.986 --> 13:00.779
What to use this for.

13:01.489 --> 13:02.615
Hurry up!

13:02.698 --> 13:05.576
I'm not good at being bad, okay?
I'm doing my best!

13:05.659 --> 13:06.535
You got me!

13:09.079 --> 13:11.165
Just pick up the cage
and we'll open it later.

13:11.248 --> 13:12.708
Fine.

13:13.501 --> 13:16.587
Just gonna…

13:16.670 --> 13:17.796
This is pathetic.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.173
It's heavy!

13:20.341 --> 13:22.259
-Is that…
-Yeah.

13:22.843 --> 13:24.178
Okay.

13:24.762 --> 13:26.347
Hold up!

13:26.430 --> 13:27.515
Hey, Dragon Master.

13:28.098 --> 13:31.060
Oh! Hey, guys. I was just, uh…

13:31.143 --> 13:33.604
The thing was, I, uh…

13:33.687 --> 13:35.064
Nice quills.

13:35.147 --> 13:37.274
You, uh… You freeing our prisoner there?

13:37.942 --> 13:40.819
Yeah, yeah, you, uh, you freeing him?
What, whatcha doing there?

13:40.903 --> 13:42.321
Just knock them out and run!

13:42.905 --> 13:46.033
Oh! I'm actually here
to take this prisoner

13:46.116 --> 13:47.868
straight to the Imperial Guard myself.

13:47.952 --> 13:50.120
Oh. We weren't informed of this.

13:50.204 --> 13:53.499
Oh, uh, Elder Huang
didn't wanna tell people.

13:53.582 --> 13:55.251
Wanted it to be a surprise.

13:55.334 --> 13:56.418
A surprise?

13:56.502 --> 13:58.170
Yeah. 'Cause it's her, uh…

13:58.671 --> 13:59.505
birthday.

13:59.588 --> 14:01.340
Oh! I love birthdays.

14:01.423 --> 14:03.551
Wow. You're really stepping in it.

14:08.013 --> 14:10.683
-Where is he?

14:13.561 --> 14:16.105
-The Imperial Guards?

14:18.774 --> 14:21.193
So, she asked for no cake.

14:21.277 --> 14:23.112
Huh. Cake is the best part.

14:23.195 --> 14:26.699
But the Emperor, he was all, like,
"Come on, Elder, everyone loves cake."

14:26.782 --> 14:28.242
Yeah. Who doesn't like cake?

14:28.325 --> 14:30.911
So, he sent me ahead
to make sure she didn't eat cake.

14:30.995 --> 14:33.038
Sure, sure. Lotta carbs.

14:33.122 --> 14:35.666
-Yeah. Sugar, too.
-Yeah. S-Sugars are carbs.

14:35.749 --> 14:38.210
-Is that right?
-Yeah. A lot of people don't know that.

14:38.294 --> 14:41.297
So that when he sent the guards
with the cake that he made,

14:41.380 --> 14:42.548
she'd still be hungry.

14:42.631 --> 14:44.967
What, uh, does that
have to do with our prisoner?

14:45.551 --> 14:47.595
Yeah, Po. What?

14:50.681 --> 14:53.642
Wow! I gotta get me one of those.

14:53.726 --> 14:56.020
Uh, one of what?

14:56.896 --> 14:59.023
-Does he mean the wall?

14:59.106 --> 15:00.107
Dragon Master?

15:00.733 --> 15:03.569
-The Dragon Master left.
-You thinking what I'm thinking?

15:03.652 --> 15:06.155
-You wanna get some cake?
-Exactly.

15:18.584 --> 15:20.419
Oh no! Imperial Guards!

15:23.589 --> 15:26.383
Hey! Whoa! Ow!

15:33.140 --> 15:35.142
-Ow. Ow…

15:36.810 --> 15:37.645
Ow.

15:37.728 --> 15:39.855
Well, well, well. Look who it is.

15:39.939 --> 15:44.193
Seems like the former Dragon Master
has a new job.

15:44.276 --> 15:45.819
He's a delivery boy.

15:48.238 --> 15:51.909
Thanks a lot, panda.
You've made our jobs a lot easier.

15:55.579 --> 15:58.123
I'm sorry.
I did the best that I could.

15:58.207 --> 16:02.127
The monks caught me and-- Blade, no!
Those are the Emperor's men!

16:02.211 --> 16:04.880
Hand over the prisoner.

16:16.183 --> 16:18.560
You think your little sword's
going to intimidate us?

16:18.644 --> 16:22.314
There's four of us and one of you.

16:22.398 --> 16:24.817
Stop us. I dare you.

17:00.227 --> 17:02.604
Hey! That's my friend!

17:05.858 --> 17:08.944
-Uh, I don't wanna hurt anyone.

17:10.863 --> 17:12.990
-Sorry. Sorry.

17:13.073 --> 17:15.367
-Sorry. Sorry.

17:17.494 --> 17:19.246
Sorry. Sorry.

17:19.329 --> 17:21.707
-Sorry. Sorry.

17:31.592 --> 17:33.218
You sure you wanna do this?

17:33.302 --> 17:34.511
Not really.

17:34.595 --> 17:37.139
I apologize
for everything I'm about to do.

17:55.699 --> 17:56.533
Thanks.

17:57.117 --> 17:59.328
-Lesser evil, right?

17:59.411 --> 18:03.707
Uh, hate to break up this lovefest,
but I'm still in a cage over here.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.627
Get me out of here
before the soldiers wake up.

18:26.730 --> 18:27.689
Right here.

18:29.399 --> 18:31.652
We freed you. Now, tell us what you saw.

18:32.236 --> 18:33.612
Deal's a deal.

18:34.571 --> 18:36.323
I saw them steal a scroll.

18:36.406 --> 18:37.616
Which one?

18:37.699 --> 18:39.618
The Tianshang Weapons.

18:39.701 --> 18:40.953
Huh.

18:42.246 --> 18:44.414
In a time before the Lotus,

18:44.498 --> 18:45.958
before history,

18:46.041 --> 18:48.669
the world was one great landmass.

18:48.752 --> 18:49.795
Pangaea.

18:50.295 --> 18:51.463
Kind of a dopey name.

18:51.547 --> 18:55.425
Anyway, some of the people
who lived there had a great power.

18:55.926 --> 18:57.845
They could control the elements.

18:58.387 --> 19:01.849
And for a long time, everything was cool.

19:02.516 --> 19:04.059
Until it wasn't.

19:04.643 --> 19:07.187
Because one day, a group of them decided--

19:07.688 --> 19:10.440
Well, I'm not totally sure
what they decided.

19:10.524 --> 19:13.819
But they basically wanted to
rule Pangaea with an iron fist,

19:13.902 --> 19:17.573
and destroy anyone in their way.

19:18.657 --> 19:23.495
But, a team of elemental warriors
banded together to stop them.

19:23.579 --> 19:24.997
They used their own magic

19:25.080 --> 19:30.085
to create four weapons that
could trap those evil guys inside forever.

19:34.173 --> 19:37.509
But when they did,
the elements were thrown off balance,

19:38.093 --> 19:40.220
and the world split apart.

19:41.180 --> 19:44.016
-What were these weapons?
-One was a helmet.

19:44.099 --> 19:45.767
There was some sort of glove.

19:45.851 --> 19:48.061
-It's a gauntlet.
-Whatever.

19:48.854 --> 19:51.940
And, like, a fire whip, or something.

19:52.024 --> 19:54.151
And one other. I don't remember.

19:55.652 --> 19:57.112
I'm not the expert here.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.198
That's quite literally what you are.

19:59.281 --> 20:01.491
But anyway, there's four of them.

20:05.537 --> 20:08.999
They were scattered,
so no one could have this power again.

20:11.668 --> 20:13.420
Then lost to time.

20:15.756 --> 20:18.425
Separately, they are all dangerous.

20:18.508 --> 20:20.510
Together? Oh, boy!

20:21.803 --> 20:24.306
Klaus and Veruca must be after all four.

20:24.389 --> 20:27.100
Wait, wait.
Did you say one of them was a whip?

20:27.184 --> 20:30.479
A whip of flame, a whip of flame…
That sounds so familiar!

20:30.562 --> 20:34.191
She's escaped!
The Dragon Master and Zhen are in cahoots!

20:34.274 --> 20:36.193
-We have to move.
-They'll see us!

20:36.276 --> 20:37.861
Wait. Where's Zhen?

20:41.615 --> 20:42.574
Woohoo!

20:43.158 --> 20:44.701
This'll keep them occupied!

20:44.785 --> 20:48.121
So,
you did do all those other things?

20:48.205 --> 20:50.082
You do know what fireworks are.

20:50.165 --> 20:53.877
Oh, and it feels so right, baby!

20:58.632 --> 21:00.968
Po, we need to leave. Now.

21:09.768 --> 21:13.021
Dragon Master, how could you?

21:15.357 --> 21:16.191
Po.

21:17.192 --> 21:18.402
Yeah, I'm coming.

21:24.992 --> 21:29.204
Four weapons. Four!
I thought I had a chance.

21:29.288 --> 21:32.666
But now we've lost the trail,
and they're just getting started.

21:32.749 --> 21:36.128
If we follow the thumb,
we'll always be one step behind them.

21:36.795 --> 21:38.297
We'll always be too late.

21:38.797 --> 21:41.425
Unless we know
where they're heading!

21:42.050 --> 21:45.846
Hm, the Whip of Endless Flame…

21:48.348 --> 21:50.225
The whip… Aha, aha!

21:50.309 --> 21:54.187
Look at this. Huh?

21:55.605 --> 21:57.649
Fictional drawings for children.

21:57.733 --> 22:01.695
We prefer the term graphic novel,
and it's based on fact.

22:01.778 --> 22:04.781
Okay, Whip of Endless Flame.

22:04.865 --> 22:07.284
Uh… Here! Here, here, here.

22:07.367 --> 22:10.787
The Whip of Endless Flame,
like Zhen was talking about!

22:10.871 --> 22:15.792
Too powerful for any one man to use,
so it must be hidden from the world.

22:17.461 --> 22:18.545
"Master Long-Tooth,

22:18.628 --> 22:22.632
now that I have the Whip of Endless Flame,
I know exactly where to hide it."

22:22.716 --> 22:24.092
Told you this wasn't junk!

22:25.385 --> 22:28.472
Our answer lies on the very next page!

22:31.016 --> 22:33.101
-"To be continued."

22:34.186 --> 22:38.065
To be continued? To be continued?!

22:38.648 --> 22:39.775
I hate when it says--
