It's like those
wacky radio contests.

09:06.367 --> 09:07.667
Oh.
Guess how many

09:07.667 --> 09:11.300
Ping-Pong balls are in the jar.

09:11.300 --> 09:15.800
Uh... 237.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.000
Chels?

09:19.000 --> 09:19.800
Yeah?

09:19.800 --> 09:20.767
How'd you know that?

09:20.767 --> 09:23.600
Isn't it obvious?

09:27.500 --> 09:29.233
Look, my show
was doing just fine

09:29.233 --> 09:30.934
without all
of these gimmicks.

09:30.934 --> 09:32.400
Now, I got to my locker
and get some CDs.

09:32.400 --> 09:33.400
I'll be right back.

09:33.400 --> 09:34.800
Hurry back there, partner.

09:34.800 --> 09:36.000
We're on in two minutes.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.300
I know when we're on.

09:40.300 --> 09:41.867
Whoa. Whoa.

09:41.867 --> 09:43.133
Is it me, Chels,

09:43.133 --> 09:45.100
or am I detecting
a little attitudinal problem?

09:45.100 --> 09:46.600
Well, Rae, you kind of were

09:46.600 --> 09:48.600
coming on pretty strong,
you know?

09:48.600 --> 09:50.000
This show is like Eddie's baby.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.200
I have never had
a baby or anything,

09:52.200 --> 09:56.200
but I hear people get, like,
really attached to them.

09:56.200 --> 09:59.600
Chels, you're right.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.667
This is Eddie's baby.
He loves it.

10:01.667 --> 10:02.800
I don't want Eddie

10:02.800 --> 10:03.867
to think that I'm taking over.

10:03.867 --> 10:04.867
I'm just going to sit back

10:04.867 --> 10:06.667
and let him do his thing.

10:07.834 --> 10:09.834
All right, people,
it's show time.

10:09.834 --> 10:11.100
All right, all right.

10:11.100 --> 10:12.200
Come on,
let's make

10:12.200 --> 10:13.200
some radio magic.

10:13.200 --> 10:14.400
Five, four...

Morning, Bayside!

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
We coming at you to lift
that homeroom gloom, y'all.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.600
I'm DJ Eddie T.

10:29.934 --> 10:31.600
And I'm Rae.

10:31.600 --> 10:33.233
Hey.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.100
So, uh, Rae, why don't you
tell the people

10:37.100 --> 10:38.400
about your great ideas.

10:40.500 --> 10:42.133
Nah.

10:42.133 --> 10:46.033
Well, uh, what about
the Ping-Pong balls?

10:46.033 --> 10:48.033
Eh...

10:49.600 --> 10:51.367
Uh, Rae, I could use

10:51.367 --> 10:54.500
a little bit more then a "eh."

10:55.400 --> 10:57.900
Mm-eh-uh-huh...

11:02.834 --> 11:04.400
I don't get it, Rae.

11:04.400 --> 11:06.867
I mean, you said you had
all these great ideas

11:06.867 --> 11:08.200
and now suddenly
you have

11:08.200 --> 11:09.300
nothing to say.

11:09.300 --> 11:11.834
I mean, you never
have nothing to say.

11:12.934 --> 11:14.400
Well, Eddie, this is your show.

11:14.400 --> 11:16.934
I just want you to sit back
and do your thing.

11:16.934 --> 11:18.567
Well, it's not my thing anymore,

11:18.567 --> 11:19.600
it's our thing.

11:19.600 --> 11:21.500
And you're messing
it up, Rae.

11:21.500 --> 11:23.000
Why would I do that?

11:23.000 --> 11:24.400
I don't know.

11:24.400 --> 11:25.800
Maybe you're trying
to make me look bad.

11:25.800 --> 11:27.467
Maybe you want the show
for yourself or something?

11:27.467 --> 11:29.200
Whoa, whoa,
maybe you're tripping.

11:29.200 --> 11:30.600
Oh, so I'm tripping?

11:30.600 --> 11:31.400
Look, I'm not

11:31.400 --> 11:32.500
going to stick around

11:32.500 --> 11:33.867
and watch you make
a fool out of me

11:33.867 --> 11:35.300
on my own show.
I'm out of here.

11:35.300 --> 11:37.000
Eddie.

11:46.233 --> 11:47.467
Chels,

11:47.467 --> 11:48.600
what did he say?

11:48.600 --> 11:50.033
Um, well...

11:50.033 --> 11:52.767
it's really, it's not so much
what he said, as, um,

11:52.767 --> 11:55.000
as how loud
he was actually screaming it.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.233
I can't believe
Eddie's still mad at me.

11:57.233 --> 11:59.000
Well, Rae, you know, it's Eddie.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.233
He's going to get over it.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.900
Oh, wow.

12:11.900 --> 12:15.300
High school, 75 years.

12:15.300 --> 12:18.967
This school
still smell the same.

12:23.800 --> 12:25.500
Chelsea!

12:25.500 --> 12:27.500
Baby, hi.

12:27.500 --> 12:29.200
What took you so long?

12:29.200 --> 12:31.367
Oh, I'm sorry, Rae.

12:31.367 --> 12:33.200
You know, my molecules

12:33.200 --> 12:37.033
don't really work as fast
as they used to.

Oh...

12:48.500 --> 12:49.900
Hey, Eddie.

12:49.900 --> 12:51.834
How you been?

12:51.834 --> 12:53.100
Give me a hug.

12:59.300 --> 13:00.700
How have I been?

13:00.700 --> 13:02.400
I've been mad.

13:02.400 --> 13:06.367
Eddie, it's been 75 years

13:06.367 --> 13:09.567
since the radio thing,
darling, let it go.

13:09.567 --> 13:10.967
Never.

13:10.967 --> 13:13.000
I just came here to tell you

13:13.000 --> 13:15.600
that I ain't going
to never forgive you.

13:19.767 --> 13:21.300
Eat my dust.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.900
Chels, I just saw
the future.

13:30.900 --> 13:32.734
Okay, Rae, sweetie,

13:32.734 --> 13:34.567
you always see the future.

13:34.567 --> 13:37.200
Chels, it was way,
way into the future.

13:37.200 --> 13:38.200
Girl, we were at

13:38.200 --> 13:41.500
our 75th school reunion.

13:41.500 --> 13:45.700
We went to 75 schools?

13:45.700 --> 13:50.000
Chels, no,
it was our school.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.734
Oh.

13:51.734 --> 13:52.934
And Eddie
was still mad at me.

13:52.934 --> 13:54.567
I can't
let that happen.

13:54.567 --> 13:57.200
Hey, I bet you
can't wait to hang out

13:57.200 --> 13:59.767
with your new, young,
hip dad, huh?

13:59.767 --> 14:02.100
I'm just happy you're happy.

14:02.100 --> 14:04.500
Then you're going to get
even happier.

14:05.400 --> 14:07.467
Check out the funky
fresh outfit

14:07.467 --> 14:08.467
I got for you.

So, go ahead,

14:19.700 --> 14:22.567
try them on and then
we'll head down to the mall.

14:22.567 --> 14:24.400

I was just, uh...

14:50.100 --> 14:51.967
taking it out for some air?

14:51.967 --> 14:54.500
Corey, grab the wig
and come here.

14:56.400 --> 14:58.400
What's going on?

14:58.400 --> 15:01.600
Daddy's hair
is creeping me out.

15:01.600 --> 15:05.567
I thought you said you wanted
a younger, hipper dad.

15:05.567 --> 15:07.367
And I thought
you missed your hair.

15:07.367 --> 15:09.600
I have no problems being bald.

15:09.600 --> 15:11.800

you made it what it was.

20:09.834 --> 20:11.100
Yeah, and I couldn't admit

20:11.100 --> 20:13.233
that having you on my show
made it even better.

20:13.233 --> 20:16.400
Not having you on it
made it a disaster.

20:16.400 --> 20:20.100
Look, the bottom line is,
my pride was hurt, Rae,

20:20.100 --> 20:21.700
and I acted like a jerk.

20:21.700 --> 20:24.033
So if you want to stay on
the show and do it with me,

20:24.033 --> 20:25.767
it's totally cool.

20:25.767 --> 20:27.133
Nah.

20:27.133 --> 20:30.200
But if you ever need
a guest or a friend,

20:30.200 --> 20:31.667
I'm there for you.

20:31.667 --> 20:33.767
Thanks, Rae.

20:33.767 --> 20:36.967
ALL:
Ah...

20:36.967 --> 20:38.667
Hit my jingle, Chels.

20:38.667 --> 20:40.300
Eddie...

20:40.300 --> 20:42.000
would you?

20:51.500 --> 20:52.800
Trisha, how could you?

20:52.800 --> 20:54.500
What do you mean, Frederick?

20:54.500 --> 20:55.900
Man, this is boring.

20:55.900 --> 20:57.133
The game is on.
Hey, Eddie.

20:57.133 --> 20:58.567
Eddie, no, uh-uh. No.

20:58.567 --> 21:01.033
You are not turning off
my soap, okay?

21:01.033 --> 21:03.967
Not until I find out
if Trisha's baby is an alien.

21:05.100 --> 21:07.734
Here's a clue, Rae--
the kid's got green skin.

21:07.734 --> 21:09.200
That doesn't mean anything.

21:09.200 --> 21:11.500
You guys! Please, stop, okay?

21:11.500 --> 21:13.000
You know what
can happen

21:13.000 --> 21:14.400
when you two
start fighting.

21:21.100 --> 21:22.300
Eddie!

21:22.300 --> 21:23.867
Hey, Eddie.

21:24.967 --> 21:28.200
Raven, Chelsea,
how long has it been?

21:28.200 --> 21:30.200
Around ten minutes.

21:30.200 --> 21:32.667
We left the teleport
at the same time.

21:32.667 --> 21:34.033
Oh, I know.

21:34.033 --> 21:36.834
It was just an excuse
to hug on my two best friends.

21:36.834 --> 21:38.200
Oh...
Oh...

21:38.200 --> 21:40.834
Whoa!
Whoa!

21:42.367 --> 21:43.767
Guys,

21:43.767 --> 21:45.367
just checked out the future.

21:45.367 --> 21:46.934
We're going
to be friends forever.

21:46.934 --> 21:49.200
Aw.
Good, then give me
the remote.

21:49.200 --> 21:50.133
Uh-uh, no!

21:50.133 --> 21:51.467
You cannot have the remote.

21:51.467 --> 21:52.600
I can have anything
I want to.

21:53.300 --> 21:54.233
You cannot in my house.

21:54.233 --> 21:55.400
Let me tell
you something.

21:55.400 --> 21:56.500
The kid's got
green skin.

21:56.500 --> 21:58.600
