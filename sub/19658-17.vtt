My dad's out there,

somewhere on the loose
with five Centurion helmets.

It's only a matter of time before
he pops up and makes his move.

We shall destroy

00:14.293 --> 00:16.286
Okay, you get points
for consistency, Drax,

00:16.353 --> 00:18.778

stand up to those helmets.

So, like I was saying,
if anyone has a weapon

that can stop J'Son and the
Centurion helmets, it's Jackie.

01:08.312 --> 01:11.327
Rocket may be right. Thanos
considered Ja Kyee's work

01:11.388 --> 01:14.922

little planet and lives in seclusion.

Okay, new plan: Get Jackie to make us
a sweet little anti-helmet weapon.

01:33.657 --> 01:35.557
Eh, Jackie hates Spartax,

help us stick it to J'Son.

build my doomsday device...</i>

to destroy every robot on the planet.</i>

06:19.555 --> 06:24.013

I was captured. And here we are.

So, these robots of
yours, do they, like,

And I say for the final time
that I will build no more weapons.

Then I must resort to
other methods of persuasion.

It's the best fight ever!

10:39.808 --> 10:41.481
Appreciate the save, Guardians.

10:41.615 --> 10:43.414
I wish there was a
way I could repay you.

10:43.468 --> 10:44.339
I don't know. Maybe we
could be best friends

10:44.364 --> 10:47.063
and hang out together and blow
stuff up, like, all the time.

10:47.155 --> 10:50.530
You mentioned you actually built
your doomsday weapon.

10:50.743 --> 10:54.112
Yeah, my jerk dad's got these
ancient Centurion helmets

10:54.206 --> 10:56.269
that make him kind of invincible.

10:56.316 --> 10:58.593
So maybe we could borrow
your E.M.P. thingie?

10:58.666 --> 11:00.546
I mean, we'll bring it right back.

11:00.652 --> 11:03.405
Problem is, my weapon is secure
inside the Ultroid fortress.

11:03.545 --> 11:07.000
It's useless to them, though, because
I'm the only one who can operate it.

11:07.093 --> 11:10.709
So, we raid the fortress, grab
the weapon, and blow 'em all up.

11:10.842 --> 11:13.435
- Problem solved.
- Or maybe we can

11:13.502 --> 11:15.861
talk the Ultroids into
giving up the weapon.

11:15.985 --> 11:18.289
You know, if I've learned
anything from movies and TV,

11:18.411 --> 11:21.335
it's how to teach robots a lesson
about the futility of war.

11:21.360 --> 11:22.640
Eh, bear with me.

11:22.676 --> 11:24.807
This is an Earth game

X's and O's on the board.

But once you know
the simple strategy,

11:33.611 --> 11:35.398
every game ends in a draw.

11:35.624 --> 11:38.890
When you realize that nobody
can win, you stop playing.

11:39.296 --> 11:42.236
Same thing with war. Boom.

11:42.303 --> 11:46.404
Let me try. Drax the
Destroyer wins at all things.

11:49.807 --> 11:54.102
- [chirps]
- [angry grunt] That did not count!

11:54.216 --> 11:56.170
Drax was still learning the rules.

11:56.244 --> 11:58.358
So Quill's dumb Earth game

11:58.383 --> 12:00.893
is gonna teach the robots
the error of their ways?

12:00.918 --> 12:02.832
[laughs] Give me a break.

12:02.960 --> 12:04.489
His idea is elegant in its simplicity.

12:04.593 --> 12:06.752
- It could work.
- I am being cheated! Again!

12:06.815 --> 12:07.876
[grumbles] Quill!

12:07.956 --> 12:10.530
- [Drax yells]
- [electricity arcing]

12:10.565 --> 12:14.360
I have beaten your game,
Quill... by destroying it!

12:14.460 --> 12:15.907
- Ha!
- See, this...

12:16.067 --> 12:18.600
This is why
we can't have nice things.

12:23.735 --> 12:25.208
That's the Ultroid fortress.

12:25.335 --> 12:27.101
My E.M.P. generator is inside.

12:27.235 --> 12:30.022
How do we get past all those
Sentries and Ultroids?

12:30.096 --> 12:31.512
Relax.

12:32.562 --> 12:35.785
Just get as close as you can
and let me do the talking.

12:37.091 --> 12:38.805
You Ultroids have stolen

12:38.845 --> 12:41.164
Almighty Engineer Lrurt
from our protection.

12:41.291 --> 12:44.096
I know you intend to have
her use the ultimate weapon

12:44.243 --> 12:46.604
to eradicate all Sentry
units from this planet.

12:46.724 --> 12:49.463
Your accusations are false, Sentry.

12:49.530 --> 12:52.320
I know you are forcing the Supreme
Builder to create a new weapon

12:52.407 --> 12:54.488
to destroy all Ultroid-kind.

12:54.728 --> 12:56.783
Prepare to fire.

13:00.758 --> 13:02.974
Now that I've got
your attention,

13:03.010 --> 13:05.410
[imitating computer voice]
shall we play a game?

13:14.273 --> 13:16.471
This is a logic test
from my home world.

13:16.591 --> 13:19.417
Only the most intelligent
can truly master it.

13:19.577 --> 13:21.265
Now, let me go over the rules.

13:21.973 --> 13:24.817
Okay, so each side takes a
turn drawing an "X" or an "O"

13:24.842 --> 13:25.824
- right here on this grid.
- Perhaps we have

13:25.849 --> 13:27.285
- <i>[Quill] Whoever gets three in a row,</i>
- underestimated Quill's plan.

13:27.309 --> 13:28.331
<i>Wins.</i>

13:28.332 --> 13:30.209
No. It's a terrible plan.

13:30.334 --> 13:31.893
But we only needed
the distraction.

13:32.012 --> 13:33.150
I knew it!

13:33.206 --> 13:35.579
I'll get that blast door op... [yelling]

13:36.064 --> 13:38.689
[sighs] Well done, Rodent.

13:39.096 --> 13:40.896
Trust me, you don't
want to call him...

13:41.002 --> 13:43.179
Jackie can call me
whatever she wants.

13:43.686 --> 13:45.500
I am Groot.

13:50.866 --> 13:53.324
[beeps] <i>[male automated voice]
Force field deactivated.</i>

13:54.519 --> 13:55.927
[yells]

13:58.817 --> 14:00.757
[Jackie] Try not to
slow us down, Rodent.

14:01.004 --> 14:02.992
[chuckling] "Rodent."

14:03.134 --> 14:05.918
That's... That's a good one, Jackie.

14:08.115 --> 14:11.454
And that is tic-tac-toe,
my metal friends.

14:11.747 --> 14:14.220
So, who wants to play?

14:14.560 --> 14:16.795
I calculate
this game is un-winable.

14:16.882 --> 14:19.525
Agreed. Blast the biological.

14:19.814 --> 14:20.814
What?

14:21.363 --> 14:23.711
Oh, hey, now! [Yelling]

14:29.969 --> 14:33.576
[gasps] I... I can't believe I'm here.

14:37.191 --> 14:38.683
It'll take some time
to build up a charge.

14:38.707 --> 14:39.462
[Beeps]

14:39.487 --> 14:41.028
- [robotic suits powering up]
- It's... It's...

14:41.052 --> 14:45.267
It's like a dream...
A beautiful, beautiful dream.

14:45.384 --> 14:47.211
- [robot suit clacking]
- Wait! Don't touch those!

14:47.235 --> 14:49.334
- [chuckles] Huh?
- [Alarm blaring]

14:50.472 --> 14:53.395
Intruders, prepare to be terminated.

14:53.488 --> 14:55.030
[alarm continues blaring]

14:56.572 --> 14:59.258
And the dream is now a nightmare.

15:02.095 --> 15:05.247
The Supreme Builder has
activated the doomsday weapon.

15:05.420 --> 15:06.653
Destroy it.

15:09.947 --> 15:11.846
No! The weapon!

15:12.313 --> 15:14.479
Capture the Supreme Builder.

15:14.552 --> 15:17.785
- Terminate the intruders.
- [Rocket] Quick, get in the mech suits!

15:17.826 --> 15:20.557
- [Drax] But Jackie said not to touch them.
- The Rodent's right.

15:20.633 --> 15:23.003
The suits will give us
protection and firepower.

15:27.756 --> 15:31.045
I know you're my hero and all,
Jackie, but I changed my mind.

15:31.185 --> 15:33.465
Don't call me "Rodent"!

15:41.442 --> 15:44.102
So you don't like
tic-tac-toe. How about tag?

15:44.310 --> 15:45.801
You're it.

15:48.417 --> 15:51.522
- [crash]
- Okay, how about 20 questions?

15:52.202 --> 15:54.495
- [Sentry] Destroy the biological.
- [grunts]

15:54.608 --> 15:56.734
That is not a question. [Grunts]

15:57.284 --> 15:58.980
[yelling]

15:59.114 --> 16:01.271
[grunts, groans]

16:01.570 --> 16:03.730
Fine. Well, I've got
a question for you.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.549
What's the meaning of life?

16:06.069 --> 16:09.854
Here's another one. Which came
first, the chicken or the egg?

16:10.508 --> 16:12.569
No? Nothing? Okay.

16:12.974 --> 16:16.193
Uh, bet you can't calculate
pi to the last digit. [Yells]

16:18.430 --> 16:21.856
Ha-ha! There is no
final digit for pi!

16:22.006 --> 16:25.217
- That'll melt your mainframe.
- [robotic suit approaching]

16:26.092 --> 16:27.586
[Sentry approaching]

16:29.889 --> 16:31.193
[Gamora grunts]

16:31.948 --> 16:33.826
How'd your talking strategy go?

16:34.034 --> 16:37.526
I got them to agree on one
thing... uh, blasting me.

16:46.257 --> 16:48.910
This is how I do my best talking!

16:51.812 --> 16:53.320
[Drax yelling]

16:57.816 --> 16:59.930
I am Groot!

17:01.079 --> 17:02.150
Okay.

17:02.199 --> 17:03.848
I'm thinking we may
not be able to talk...

17:03.873 --> 17:06.849
And by "talk," I mean "shoot"...
Our way out of this either.

17:07.034 --> 17:10.316
[Rocket] Ain't no problem can't
be solved by blowing it up!

17:12.903 --> 17:13.904
[grunts]

17:13.962 --> 17:15.787
We're shutting it down
with an E.M.P.

17:15.904 --> 17:18.185
Please tell me you found
the doomsday device.

17:18.473 --> 17:21.007
We did,
but the robots blew it up.

17:21.092 --> 17:23.272
The robots blew up the thing
we need to blow them up.

17:23.367 --> 17:25.032
I'm aware of the irony!

17:25.146 --> 17:26.409
The real irony is that I thought

17:26.433 --> 17:28.927
I could help people
by building these things.

17:29.207 --> 17:30.293
That's it!

17:30.327 --> 17:32.864
We can't talk our way
out or blast our way out,

17:32.957 --> 17:35.390
but... we can build our way out!

17:37.153 --> 17:39.813
[grunts] Now's not a
good time to tinker!

17:40.894 --> 17:42.779
Just trust me.

17:59.321 --> 18:02.392
Ohh, it's brilliant. Keep going.

18:02.593 --> 18:04.431
Everyone form up on me!

18:07.976 --> 18:09.037
What is happening?

18:09.106 --> 18:12.304
[Rocket] All of Jackie's creations
use Universal Hex Bolts.

18:12.370 --> 18:14.283
They make her machines customizable.

18:14.396 --> 18:16.569
So I'm customizing.

18:16.849 --> 18:18.562
I am Groot?

18:19.448 --> 18:22.145
[Rocket] Gammy, Groot, don't move.

18:29.019 --> 18:31.478
Ladies, gentlemen, and vegetables,

18:31.511 --> 18:34.476
I give you the Jackie-hammer!

18:35.223 --> 18:36.923
Mm. Like the name.

18:37.009 --> 18:40.482
Shape-shifting robot!
Totally called it!

18:50.121 --> 18:53.776
Yes! Drax the Destroyer
wishes to punch some more!

18:54.455 --> 18:56.052
[alarm blaring]

18:56.328 --> 18:59.301
Uh, Drax, wish granted.

18:59.607 --> 19:01.480
Armor can't take
much more of this.

19:01.652 --> 19:04.790
Rocket, I need you to modulate the
core so it can expel all its power

19:04.864 --> 19:06.672
in a single electromagnetic pulse.

19:06.865 --> 19:07.980
An E.M.P.

19:08.177 --> 19:10.724
Just like your doomsday device?
But... But that'll...

19:10.783 --> 19:12.844
Deactivate all the robots
on the planet,

19:12.925 --> 19:14.261
including this one.

19:14.341 --> 19:16.453
I'm trusting you
to do this, Rocket.

19:16.542 --> 19:18.726
You're trusting me?

19:19.824 --> 19:22.052
[yelling]

19:26.135 --> 19:28.781
I won't let you down, Jackie.

19:31.202 --> 19:32.830
[yells]

19:33.794 --> 19:35.872
[clicking] [grunting]

19:38.167 --> 19:40.202
Rocket, hurry!

19:40.522 --> 19:43.021
Okay, let 'em have it!

19:53.151 --> 19:54.989
[powering down]

20:01.611 --> 20:04.050
[Gamora] Rocket, you saved us.

20:04.224 --> 20:06.832
Yeah, and all I had to do
was destroy

20:06.912 --> 20:09.478
every one of Jackie's creations.

20:13.429 --> 20:15.789
You sure you don't want
to come with us, Jackie?

20:15.908 --> 20:19.066
Nah. Too many broken
things to fix around here.

20:25.592 --> 20:26.903
I signed it.

20:27.377 --> 20:29.543
- To keep you inspired.
- Huh?

20:29.663 --> 20:33.842
Truth is, my E.M.P. weapon won't
work on Nova Centurion helmets.

20:34.002 --> 20:36.245
Their tech is so
ancient and complicated,

20:36.332 --> 20:37.998
even I couldn't figure it out.

20:38.453 --> 20:41.268
But... you're Ja Kyee Lrurt.

20:41.334 --> 20:43.461
They say successors
first have to destroy

20:43.547 --> 20:45.916
their masters' works
before they surpass them.

20:46.182 --> 20:48.635
Wait. Y-You mean <i> I'm</i>

20:48.722 --> 20:51.307
your successor?

20:51.427 --> 20:53.127
That's why I retired.

20:53.347 --> 20:54.771
I knew that little Roden...

20:54.881 --> 20:58.466
Uh, young upstart would get
past my defenses someday.

20:58.694 --> 21:01.759
And I'll bet you can get
past Nova Centurion tech too.

21:02.299 --> 21:05.679
Now go grab the title.
You've earned it.

21:08.513 --> 21:11.050
You heard the lady, Quill.

21:11.264 --> 21:13.989
Let's fire up the <i> Milano!</i>

21:14.643 --> 21:16.371
Yeah, about that.

21:16.524 --> 21:18.808
Um, I have an idea
for your next project.

21:18.888 --> 21:21.001
Maybe you can build us
a new remote control.

21:21.047 --> 21:24.497
[laughs] Oh, I already
got a back-up system.

21:24.747 --> 21:28.747
It's called get your flargin' butt
up there and bring back my ship!

21:28.861 --> 21:30.169
[Quill yelling] [laughing]

21:30.276 --> 21:32.676
Rocket! [Laughing continues]
