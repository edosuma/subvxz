01:16.360 --> 01:19.193
This is a man's world

01:19.480 --> 01:20.879
This is a man's world

01:21.080 --> 01:22.593
Baby!

01:22.840 --> 01:25.752
-But it wouldn't mean nothing
-But it wouldn't mean nothing

01:25.960 --> 01:27.393
Nothing

01:27.600 --> 01:29.989
Without a woman or a girl

01:31.120 --> 01:33.076
Well, tonight, my NO MA'AM brothers...

01:33.320 --> 01:36.392
...while our wives are flirting
their lives away at bingo...

01:36.640 --> 01:38.756
...we will be watching
the sport of kings:

01:39.000 --> 01:41.195
-Wrestling.
-Yes.

01:42.360 --> 01:44.999
Have we got the necessary snacks
from the Just Store?

01:45.240 --> 01:48.516
-Yeah. l got Just Oreo filling.
-l've got Just jerky.

01:48.760 --> 01:51.832
And l've got Just alcohol.

01:55.400 --> 01:58.278
Okay, guys, let's party like Kennedys.

01:58.520 --> 01:59.509
Yes!

02:01.520 --> 02:04.114
This is a man's wo--

02:06.800 --> 02:09.189
Well, Peg, like l said
when l woke up this morning:

02:09.400 --> 02:11.868
What the hell are you doing here?

02:12.720 --> 02:18.431
We skipped bingo tonight to watch
the TV movie Old Man Older Woman.

02:19.120 --> 02:21.429
They made a movie of our love life?

02:22.760 --> 02:27.834
No. That would be
Young Redhead Younger Pizza Boy.

02:29.200 --> 02:32.636
Old Man Older Woman
is the TV movie event of the season.

02:32.880 --> 02:35.474
lt's an epic love story
spanning three generations...

02:35.720 --> 02:38.678
...ages 7 0 through 1 00.

02:39.200 --> 02:41.589
Starring Hume Cronyn,
Katharine Hepburn...

02:41.840 --> 02:44.991
...and introducing Buddy Ebsen
as Junior.

02:46.560 --> 02:49.154
-CBS?
-Of course.

02:50.960 --> 02:55.988
Well, Marcie, l'm afraid
that you and the Joy Cluck Club...

02:56.240 --> 02:59.789
...are going to have to miss
slipping denture theatre tonight...

03:00.040 --> 03:02.270
...because me and the guys
are watching wrestling.

03:02.480 --> 03:06.553
-Yeah.
-You'll watch it over my dead body.

03:06.800 --> 03:08.279
Okay.

03:08.760 --> 03:11.513
All right. All right.
Come on, guys.

03:11.760 --> 03:14.035
Let's go back to my place.
We don't have to stay...

03:14.240 --> 03:16.879
-...and take guff from the women.
-Hold it, mister.

03:17.120 --> 03:21.159
You know the rules:
''Only one friend over at a time.''

03:22.600 --> 03:25.273
But l did all my chores.

03:26.280 --> 03:29.158
There must be somewhere
we can proudly watch wrestling.

03:29.400 --> 03:32.119
How about your grown son's room
down in the basement?

03:32.360 --> 03:33.873
Griff, you're a genius.

03:34.120 --> 03:36.953
We'll watch it on Bud's TV.

03:40.680 --> 03:43.558
'' Please do not disturb.
l'm getting some.''

03:44.480 --> 03:46.277
The door is locked.

03:46.520 --> 03:48.397
You really think
he's got a girl in there?

03:48.600 --> 03:50.670
Five bucks says he doesn't.

03:53.440 --> 03:56.750
Bud, l'm not like other girls.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.228
l understand.

04:00.480 --> 04:03.552
l only go all the way on the first date.

04:16.800 --> 04:19.951
l'll be a son of a gun.
He does have a girl down here.

04:22.720 --> 04:25.359
Excuse me. Excuse me.
l got a girl here.

04:25.600 --> 04:29.513
l know. You just cost me 5 bucks.
Damn you.

04:30.560 --> 04:34.951
Don't mind us.
We just gonna be watching wrestling.

04:38.320 --> 04:41.710
-Just Cheetos' dust?
-Just stick it.

04:50.400 --> 04:52.470
Thanks, Dad. Thanks.

04:54.280 --> 04:56.589
That was Nasty Natalie.

04:57.480 --> 04:59.391
She's the easiest girl in town.

05:00.320 --> 05:03.471
Bud, if my father scared away
the easiest girl in my town...

05:03.680 --> 05:05.989
...l'd never have gotten married,
nor had you kids.

05:06.200 --> 05:08.236
l'd be upstairs watching TV
in my underwear...

05:08.440 --> 05:09.873
...the way God had intended.

05:14.400 --> 05:15.958
What's wrong with the TV?

05:16.200 --> 05:18.430
You gotta stand behind it
with a clothes hanger...

05:18.640 --> 05:19.914
...for the picture to clear.

05:20.120 --> 05:22.998
Oh, hey. They're about to interview
King Kong Bundy.

05:23.240 --> 05:26.198
Hey, Al, are you any relation
to King Kong Bundy?

05:26.440 --> 05:29.238
No. But he did take Peg's nickname.

05:31.840 --> 05:34.638
Check out King Kong's
''curvaliscious'' valet...

05:34.880 --> 05:36.757
...Anytime.

05:38.520 --> 05:39.873
Listen up, wrestling fans.

05:40.120 --> 05:41.394
I'm King Kong Bundy.

05:41.640 --> 05:45.838
And tomorrow, Halloween night,
live from Chicago's ''Dick-a-dome''...

05:46.080 --> 05:48.116
...I'm going to tak e
that Captain Ecology...

05:48.320 --> 05:51.073
...and tear him a new ozone hole.

05:51.320 --> 05:52.548
Isn't that right, Anytime?

05:52.800 --> 05:57.999
Oh, if you say so it must be so,
King Kong-o.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.191
She's brilliant.

06:03.240 --> 06:04.719
Remember, that's tomorrow night.

06:04.960 --> 06:08.396
Right after
the Mik e Tyson, Macaulay Culkin fight.

06:10.320 --> 06:12.390
King Kong Bundy is the greatest.

06:12.640 --> 06:13.868
He's my idol.

06:14.120 --> 06:16.031
Well, him and Yanni.

06:17.520 --> 06:19.954
Hey, l think we should make
King Kong Bundy...

06:20.200 --> 06:22.634
-...an honorary member of NO MA'AM.
-Good idea.

06:22.880 --> 06:24.836
-That's a good idea.
-Wait a second.

06:25.080 --> 06:27.435
l've been trying to get in
for six months now.

06:27.680 --> 06:29.636
Why is King Kong Bundy
gonna get in over me?

06:29.840 --> 06:31.273
Well, let's see.

06:31.520 --> 06:33.636
King Kong is a man's man...

06:33.880 --> 06:36.075
...and you're a human antenna.

06:37.520 --> 06:40.159
Yeah, and you suck at it.

06:42.680 --> 06:44.193
Wait a minute now, guys.

06:44.440 --> 06:46.078
That's my son we're talking about.

06:46.320 --> 06:49.073
The only one who gets
to make fun of him is me.

06:49.360 --> 06:51.157
And most women.

06:53.320 --> 06:55.675
Hey, if he wants to join NO MA'AM...

06:55.920 --> 06:59.390
...l say let's let him pledge
our proud organization.

06:59.640 --> 07:02.438
So, what do you have to do?
Chug beers until l puke?

07:03.280 --> 07:06.556
No, son. That's reserved
for full members.

07:07.840 --> 07:09.432
As a NO MA'AM pledge...

07:09.680 --> 07:11.830
...you must perform
a challenging labour...

07:12.080 --> 07:13.513
...to show you are one of us.

07:13.760 --> 07:16.149
Something brave and heroic
to benefit mankind?

07:16.400 --> 07:20.791
No. Something really, really stupid
that benefits no one.

07:21.600 --> 07:25.036
Congratulations, son,
you're an official NO MA'AM plebe.

07:25.280 --> 07:28.875
Now, tomorrow night,
you go down to Wrestle Palooza.

07:29.120 --> 07:30.792
lf you can get your picture taken...

07:31.040 --> 07:33.679
...with King Kong Bundy,
our idol, you're in.

07:33.920 --> 07:35.239
Son...

07:35.560 --> 07:37.357
...make me proud.

07:39.200 --> 07:42.397
-What if l can't get the picture?
-Well, then you can still be...

07:42.600 --> 07:45.353
...the official NO MA'AM bottle opener.

07:56.480 --> 07:58.789
Okay. Come here.

07:59.640 --> 08:04.395
Bud, the girls on the bus
were laughing with you, not at you.

08:19.240 --> 08:23.028
Kelly, l asked you to rent me a costume
so l could pass as a wrestler...

08:23.280 --> 08:26.352
...not one of
the Chuck E. Cheese players.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.553
Bud, it's Halloween.

08:28.800 --> 08:31.951
lt was either this or Pocahontas.

08:32.200 --> 08:35.272
Frankly, l don't think you
have the cleavage for it.

08:37.760 --> 08:39.113
-Hi.
-Hey.

08:39.360 --> 08:40.998
Oh, let me guess.

08:41.240 --> 08:42.514
Beauty...

08:42.760 --> 08:44.637
...and the flea, right?

08:52.440 --> 08:56.638
That's close, work release.

08:57.760 --> 08:58.909
Listen.

08:59.160 --> 09:01.037
l'm a wrestler known as...

09:01.280 --> 09:03.032
...the Bumble Bee.

09:05.200 --> 09:08.192
l don't see no insects
on tonight's card.

09:09.480 --> 09:11.311
Well, that's because--

09:11.560 --> 09:13.357
You see, l'm a backup wrestler.

09:13.600 --> 09:17.275
So in case any of the regular wrestlers
can't perform their duties, then l--

09:17.520 --> 09:19.476
He duties for them.

09:26.400 --> 09:27.753
Kelly, that's him.

09:27.960 --> 09:30.349
l need to get a picture with him
to get into NO MA'AM.

09:30.600 --> 09:33.717
-Yo, Kong, how they clanging, man?
-l'm mad.

09:33.960 --> 09:37.191
l'm madder than ma--
l'm freaking bananas.

09:37.680 --> 09:40.513
Captain Ecology just backed out
of our match.

09:40.760 --> 09:41.954
That sissy mary said:

09:42.200 --> 09:46.352
'' lt's cloudy
and my solar car won't start.''

10:01.720 --> 10:03.119
Excuse me, sir.

10:03.360 --> 10:06.557
l was wondering if l could get
a picture with you?

10:09.160 --> 10:12.277
lt would mean a lot
to my brain-dead father.

10:13.320 --> 10:16.710
Sure, kid. l do a lot of work
on behalf of the stupid.

10:18.520 --> 10:22.513
Just say, Cheez Doodles.

10:22.760 --> 10:24.910
Cheez Doodle--

10:25.160 --> 10:27.515
Wait a minute. l have an idea.

10:27.760 --> 10:31.639
Now, since my brother here
is the backup wrestler...

10:32.800 --> 10:36.395
...he could take the place
of Captain Proctology.

10:39.040 --> 10:40.553
You know? She's right.

10:40.800 --> 10:43.951
You can fight the Bumble Bee.

10:46.200 --> 10:48.839
Everyone would be happy.

10:52.480 --> 10:54.232
Everyone?

10:58.040 --> 11:01.032
This is a man's world

11:01.480 --> 11:04.552
This is a man's world

11:05.080 --> 11:07.389
But it wouldn't mean nothing

11:07.600 --> 11:09.158
Nothing

11:09.360 --> 11:13.035
Without a woman or a girl

11:14.200 --> 11:17.795
Men, tonight, while our wives are out
trick-or-treating...

11:18.040 --> 11:21.510
...dressed as large, ugly women
and a chicken...

11:22.880 --> 11:27.317
...we will be watching in colour,
on a full size TV...

11:27.560 --> 11:30.120
...Wrestle Palooza.

11:32.680 --> 11:35.148
Have we got our manly snacks
for tonight?

11:35.400 --> 11:39.837
Well, all we have left are the pretzels
Bob Rooney sucked all the salt off of.

11:45.200 --> 11:46.918
Come on. Hey, hey.

11:47.160 --> 11:49.071
What are we going to eat tonight, then?

11:49.320 --> 11:52.153
Trick or treat.

11:57.760 --> 12:01.548
By God, for you kids had
a pretty darn good night, didn't you?

12:02.240 --> 12:04.470
Don't we look scary?

12:05.000 --> 12:07.150
No. This is scary.

12:20.960 --> 12:23.349
l love Halloween.

12:23.600 --> 12:26.751
You should. Your head is shaped
like a pumpkin.

12:27.520 --> 12:31.399
Focus. Focus.
Gentlemen, focus.

12:31.640 --> 12:32.868
Now.

12:33.080 --> 12:34.638
Let us chew...

12:34.840 --> 12:35.795
...and view.

12:36.040 --> 12:38.270
This is a man's world

12:43.640 --> 12:48.714
Well, we must have gone back in time
because l'm experiencing dejà moo.

12:51.360 --> 12:56.195
We are watching the rebroadcast
of Old Man Older Woman.

12:56.440 --> 13:01.309
So much of CBS' audience fell asleep,
they're showing it again.

13:03.040 --> 13:07.556
Only this time they are airing it
earlier and louder.

13:07.800 --> 13:10.109
Forget it. We're watching wrestling.

13:10.320 --> 13:13.392
We went through too much trouble
to get snacks to let them waste.

13:14.080 --> 13:15.672
Listen...

13:16.320 --> 13:18.436
...jerk-o'-lantern.

13:20.080 --> 13:23.356
Wrestling appeals to the dregs
of American society.

13:23.600 --> 13:28.515
We women, however, appreciate
meaningful, uplifting entertainment.

13:30.840 --> 13:34.310
Oh, my God, look at that wrestler.

13:34.560 --> 13:37.472
l'd love to pin him to the mat.

13:38.400 --> 13:41.358
Now, that is a real man.

13:41.600 --> 13:46.993
Not some high school football hero
who got married and turned to mush.

13:47.440 --> 13:50.830
Well, l guess it's true what they say,
you are what you marry.

13:53.040 --> 13:55.315
That would make me a hoe.

14:01.760 --> 14:03.557
Silence. Silence.

14:03.800 --> 14:06.075
The king is entering the ring.

14:06.320 --> 14:08.311
Oh, there's just something so sexy...

14:08.560 --> 14:11.870
...about a big, oily man
in a sparkly cape.

14:12.120 --> 14:15.510
My lke felt that way
about Elvis before he died.

14:16.400 --> 14:17.913
He's alive l tell you.

14:18.200 --> 14:21.556
-Alive, l say!
-Take it easy, lke.

14:22.760 --> 14:25.399
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

14:25.640 --> 14:27.756
I'm Jimmy Lennon Jr. and welcome...

14:28.000 --> 14:31.515
... to the special Halloween edition
of Wrestle Palooza...

14:31.760 --> 14:35.833
... where tonight's wrestlers
have costumes under their costumes.

14:36.080 --> 14:40.119
Next main event features
the most feared man on Earth.

14:40.360 --> 14:45.354
Introducing King Kong Bundy.

14:50.640 --> 14:54.679
And tonight's challenger
hailing from parts unknown...

14:54.920 --> 14:58.674
...the Bumble Bee.

15:04.560 --> 15:07.518
And here are their gorgeous valets...

15:07.760 --> 15:12.276
...Anytime and Honey.

15:24.920 --> 15:27.480
-No, it's mine.
-l saw it first.

15:36.200 --> 15:39.237
You boys understand the rules, right?

15:40.120 --> 15:41.917
Yeah. l just--

15:42.200 --> 15:44.191
l just have one thing to say.

15:45.120 --> 15:47.714
Please don't kill me, man.

15:47.960 --> 15:50.838
Please, please.

15:51.080 --> 15:54.834
Don't worry, kid, you help me out.
l'll go easy on you.

16:16.320 --> 16:18.754
lt's amazing. lt's astounding.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.549
Look at the heinie on that Honey.

16:23.320 --> 16:26.232
Oh, in the ring
King Kong Bundy is down.

16:26.480 --> 16:28.869
One, two--

16:38.080 --> 16:41.277
That's what l get for trying
to take it easy on you.

16:41.520 --> 16:44.956
l expect that kind of chicanery
from the Fighting Florist.

16:45.200 --> 16:46.713
But l assumed from your valet...

16:46.960 --> 16:49.952
...you're the kind of guy
that liked girls.

16:50.200 --> 16:53.909
-l do.
-Then prepare to become one.

16:56.440 --> 16:58.829
Oh, God!

17:00.840 --> 17:03.673
Wow, this is cool.

17:04.119 --> 17:08.477
King Kong is twisting off
the Bumble Bee's stinger.

17:08.880 --> 17:11.030
That's not his stinger.

17:11.800 --> 17:13.233
Oh, girls, it's 7:00.

17:13.480 --> 17:16.040
lt's time to switch
to Old Man Older Woman.

17:16.280 --> 17:20.478
Are you insane?
And miss a televised '' Bobbitizing''?

17:22.599 --> 17:26.069
Peg, you want to grab
my whatchamacallit?

17:27.000 --> 17:30.879
Al, there's a lot of people around.

17:31.920 --> 17:32.955
Okay.

17:33.160 --> 17:35.230
No.

17:38.040 --> 17:42.192
l meant this whatchamacallit,
you cherry Blow Pop.

17:43.440 --> 17:45.556
Looks like the Bumble Bee
is making his move.

17:45.840 --> 17:49.230
Kelly. Help Me. Kelly.

17:49.480 --> 17:51.914
You're a bee, fly.

17:55.880 --> 17:57.598
That's it, Bud.

17:57.800 --> 17:58.789
Mom.

18:01.400 --> 18:03.470
Oh, this is so much fun.

18:03.720 --> 18:06.393
l think the Bumble Bee is dead.

18:07.080 --> 18:10.709
Oh, Bob Rooney, you know
what all this grunting and sweating...

18:10.960 --> 18:14.316
...and screaming reminds me of?

18:14.920 --> 18:17.673
Thanksgiving dinner at your mother's?

18:19.200 --> 18:22.078
l was thinking of what we do
after dinner...

18:22.320 --> 18:25.676
...you big turkey baster, you.

18:30.560 --> 18:31.959
Jefferson...

18:32.200 --> 18:35.988
...do you know what these sweaty men
in tight spandex remind me of?

18:36.280 --> 18:38.953
Thanksgiving dinner at your father's?

18:41.320 --> 18:43.356
Well, yes.

18:45.960 --> 18:47.871
But also--

18:52.160 --> 18:53.798
Oh, lke...

18:54.040 --> 18:57.749
...can little Elvis come out and play?

19:02.560 --> 19:03.913
You know, Al...

19:04.160 --> 19:05.718
...watching all this wrestling...

19:05.960 --> 19:09.714
...reminds me of something
l haven't had in a long time.

19:09.960 --> 19:12.758
What? Body slam?

19:14.000 --> 19:16.116
Call it what you'd like.

19:25.280 --> 19:29.831
I know I'm standing, yet I feel
lik e I'm in a warm bath.

19:32.440 --> 19:33.634
Hey. Listen, Bud.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.398
Try and get closer to King Kong...

19:35.600 --> 19:37.636
...so l can get you both in the picture.
Okay?

19:38.360 --> 19:40.157
-Okay.
-Okay.

19:40.400 --> 19:42.072
Where did he go?

19:46.080 --> 19:48.275
Bye-bye.

20:06.880 --> 20:09.155
-One, two, three--
-Five.

20:09.400 --> 20:11.516
--four, five.

20:12.040 --> 20:13.996
And the winner of the match...

20:14.240 --> 20:17.789
...King Kong Bundy.

20:18.440 --> 20:21.398
Okay, smile.

20:21.640 --> 20:24.632
Come on, my little Bumble Bee,
show me some teeth.

20:24.840 --> 20:26.273
Good.

20:45.840 --> 20:47.193
Dad?

20:47.760 --> 20:50.957
Oh, good, you're out of the coma.

20:53.400 --> 20:54.753
Where am l?

20:55.000 --> 20:57.753
ls she gone? ls it over?

20:59.240 --> 21:00.639
Yes, Dad.

21:00.880 --> 21:03.110
Now save your strength.

21:03.360 --> 21:04.873
The important thing is...

21:05.120 --> 21:08.237
...l got my picture
with King Kong Bundy.

21:09.040 --> 21:10.837
So now l'm in NO MA'AM, right?

21:11.080 --> 21:14.709
No, son. We don't watch
wrestling anymore.

21:16.520 --> 21:18.033
See, we learned tonight...

21:18.280 --> 21:21.750
...that wrestling on TV leads
to wrestling at home.

21:22.840 --> 21:26.230
And that ultimately leads
to sex with the wife.

21:27.480 --> 21:29.789
So now NO MA'AM stands for...

21:30.040 --> 21:34.079
...Numb Old
Men Anxiously Awaiting Morticians.

21:38.120 --> 21:39.838
So all this was a waste of time?

21:40.080 --> 21:41.991
Well for you, maybe.

21:42.240 --> 21:45.073
This was the best meal
l've had at home in years.

21:46.200 --> 21:50.716
This is a T-bone, mashed-potato drip
going in this arm, baby.

21:52.320 --> 21:54.117
That's eating.

21:55.240 --> 21:56.673
Hey, son...

21:56.920 --> 21:59.275
...are you gonna finish yours?
