WEBVTT

00:02.723 --> 00:06.056
(gentle brooding music)

01:16.597 --> 01:19.710
- [Arturo] Well, you know
she asked me about you

01:19.710 --> 01:21.807
like when you're gonna take
her on that sweet ride of yours

01:21.807 --> 01:23.720
but you know I had to tell her

01:23.720 --> 01:26.183
that you got your DUI,
license suspended like last-

01:26.183 --> 01:28.550
- I can't believe you told her that.

01:28.550 --> 01:29.383
- No, no, no, I didn't.

01:29.383 --> 01:31.070
I, you know I just told
her the truth, man.

01:31.070 --> 01:31.902
- Why?

01:31.902 --> 01:32.911
- [Arturo] DUI is true, man.

01:32.911 --> 01:34.530
- And why'd you have to tell her that for?

01:34.530 --> 01:36.120
What are you stupid?
- No.

01:36.120 --> 01:37.330
- Now she'll never go out with me!

01:37.330 --> 01:38.650
- [Arturo] I didn't mean anything by it.

01:38.650 --> 01:39.483
- Oh, you don't mean anything.

01:39.483 --> 01:40.560
Well, I don't mean anything by this.

01:40.560 --> 01:42.185
(fist thudding)

01:42.185 --> 01:43.180
(Arturo groaning)

01:43.180 --> 01:44.013
Get off of me!

01:44.013 --> 01:45.410
You stupid?

01:45.410 --> 01:46.981
Why'd you have to tell her that for?

01:46.981 --> 01:48.289
- [Arturo] Please calm down, man.

01:48.289 --> 01:49.362
Please, please, you're hurting me.

01:49.362 --> 01:51.098
(water splashing)

01:51.098 --> 01:51.931
(rock thuds)

01:51.931 --> 01:53.586
- What the fuck?

01:53.586 --> 01:54.419
Is he nuts?

01:55.458 --> 01:56.573
Does he wanna die?

01:59.220 --> 02:00.550
Right now watch.

02:00.550 --> 02:02.463
You're gonna see the
mother of all beatings.

02:03.523 --> 02:07.023
(suspenseful music)

02:07.023 --> 02:10.041
(water splashing)

02:10.041 --> 02:11.684
(Brock yells)

02:11.684 --> 02:13.453
(fist thudding)

02:13.453 --> 02:14.718
(water splashing)
(foot thuds)

02:14.718 --> 02:16.583
(body thuds)
(water splashing)

02:16.583 --> 02:19.480
(Arturo laughing)

02:19.480 --> 02:21.353
Okay, now I'm gonna hurt you.

02:21.353 --> 02:23.821
(water splashing)

02:23.821 --> 02:25.322
(fist thudding)

02:25.322 --> 02:26.155
(foot thuds)

02:26.155 --> 02:30.280
(body thuds)
(water splashing)

02:30.280 --> 02:31.803
- Brock, that's the Sheriff!

02:34.380 --> 02:36.650
- Why didn't you say anything?

02:36.650 --> 02:38.110
- 'Cause I don't get to fish very often

02:38.110 --> 02:39.260
and you just ruined it.

02:40.310 --> 02:41.605
Get up.

02:41.605 --> 02:44.460
(water splashing)

02:44.460 --> 02:46.960
Now I know your first name,
what's your last name?

02:48.170 --> 02:49.060
- Pasero.

02:49.060 --> 02:49.893
- You got ID?

02:56.270 --> 03:00.270
That boy you were hitting
on, I recognize him,

03:00.270 --> 03:03.710
he's the son of Dr. Aguilar,
the dentist, isn't he?

03:03.710 --> 03:04.810
What's his first name?

03:06.110 --> 03:06.943
- Arturo.

03:08.410 --> 03:10.540
- You ever lay a hand on him again

03:10.540 --> 03:12.670
and I'll be checking with him,

03:12.670 --> 03:14.070
I'll arrest you for battery.

03:15.250 --> 03:16.083
You hear me?

03:17.260 --> 03:18.480
Speak up!

03:18.480 --> 03:20.123
- [Brock] Yeah, I got it.

03:21.500 --> 03:23.978
- Now consider that a
pact between you and I,

03:23.978 --> 03:25.728
and I won't be the one to break it.

03:28.040 --> 03:29.943
Get out of here.

03:29.943 --> 03:32.776
(water splashing)

03:42.210 --> 03:45.153
(ominous music)

03:45.153 --> 03:47.820
(gate whirring)

04:00.490 --> 04:01.990
- All right, remove his cuffs.

04:04.515 --> 04:09.515
(gate thuds)
(cuffs clanging)

04:10.087 --> 04:13.730
Draven Denisen, by order
of the parole board

04:13.730 --> 04:17.050
you are here by released
from Huntsville Penitentiary

04:17.050 --> 04:19.660
having served your mandatory sentence,

04:19.660 --> 04:24.660
but as your warden having
watched you for 12 years,

04:28.286 --> 04:30.913
(chuckles) I did not want this,

04:34.080 --> 04:35.600
and I tried hard to stop it.

04:35.600 --> 04:36.433
- Did you now?

04:38.249 --> 04:40.193
We don't always get what we want.

04:41.159 --> 04:43.953
Next time try harder.

04:46.600 --> 04:49.680
- Because of the violent
nature of your crime

04:49.680 --> 04:51.510
you must report to your parole officer

04:51.510 --> 04:54.480
in San Antonio in 48 hours,

04:54.480 --> 04:59.082
and then at his discretion
for the next five years.

05:01.200 --> 05:02.523
Do you understand that?

05:04.100 --> 05:06.380
- Yes, Warden, I can tell time.

05:06.380 --> 05:07.543
I can even count too.

05:08.437 --> 05:10.740
- If you need lodging in San Antonio

05:10.740 --> 05:13.730
you should go to the Salvation
Army shelter for men.

05:13.730 --> 05:16.210
It's on Nolan Street, it's downtown.

05:16.210 --> 05:17.270
- Thanks for the advice, Warden,

05:17.270 --> 05:20.150
but I won't be need lodging in San Antonio

05:20.150 --> 05:22.250
because I won't be staying in San Antonio.

05:23.750 --> 05:24.963
I'm going to Paradise.

05:25.830 --> 05:26.663
I'm going home.

05:27.780 --> 05:29.547
I'm going to Arlettsville.

05:31.517 --> 05:34.183
(ominous music)

05:43.192 --> 05:45.586
(towel scraping)

05:45.586 --> 05:47.791
(gentle music)

05:47.791 --> 05:50.463
(door clicks)

05:50.463 --> 05:52.090
- [Carrie] Hey, handsome.

05:52.090 --> 05:53.040
How'd you make out?

05:54.930 --> 05:55.763
- Great.

05:57.030 --> 05:58.540
Help me clean these beauties.

05:58.540 --> 05:59.881
We'll be eating good tonight.

05:59.881 --> 06:01.490
- I'd love to.

06:01.490 --> 06:02.440
These are beauties.

06:04.620 --> 06:07.357
By the way how was it on the river?

06:07.357 --> 06:08.655
Was it peaceful?

06:08.655 --> 06:10.600
- Hmm.
- Was it nice?

06:10.600 --> 06:13.660
- It was heaven, just like you said.

06:13.660 --> 06:17.270
- Well, I'm glad, you know
'cause you really needed that.

06:17.270 --> 06:18.960
Break up all the stress.

06:18.960 --> 06:21.173
- Yeah, sure did, and I got it.

06:22.733 --> 06:25.563
- Well, I know if Tom were
here he would of gone with you.

06:26.500 --> 06:28.700
- I'm sure he would of
found it interesting.

06:29.540 --> 06:32.090
- But he had to go off to Texas A&M.

06:32.090 --> 06:34.800
- You say that like you resent him for it.

06:34.800 --> 06:37.163
- I don't resent him, I just miss him.

06:39.600 --> 06:40.850
- Well, then it's a good thing Becky's

06:40.850 --> 06:42.800
gonna go to community
college in September,

06:42.800 --> 06:44.200
'cause I sure don't have enough charm

06:44.200 --> 06:47.240
to fill the void in this
house if they're both gone.

06:47.240 --> 06:50.060
- Well, I wouldn't
underestimate your charm

06:50.060 --> 06:52.472
because you still wield
quite a lot of it with me.

06:52.472 --> 06:53.914
(Joe laughs)

06:53.914 --> 06:57.159
And besides it's gonna happen anyway,

06:57.159 --> 06:58.550
sooner or later it's
just gonna be you and me

06:58.550 --> 07:00.198
in this old house.

07:00.198 --> 07:04.080
- Well, we can entertain
each other, don't you think?

07:04.080 --> 07:05.850
- Hello.
- Hi.

07:05.850 --> 07:09.180
- Smells fishy in here.

07:09.180 --> 07:10.013
- Smells good to me.

07:10.013 --> 07:10.890
Good afternoon, Sheriff.

07:10.890 --> 07:11.723
- Same to you Jayden.

07:11.723 --> 07:13.340
- Mrs. Haladin.
- Hello, Jayden.

07:14.479 --> 07:15.406
- [Jayden] Nice throw.

07:15.406 --> 07:17.240
- Nice catch.

07:17.240 --> 07:19.010
- You wanna help me
clean some of these fish?

07:19.010 --> 07:20.957
Think of it like biology class.

07:20.957 --> 07:21.950
- Stop.

07:21.950 --> 07:24.236
- Dad, I'm a math major you know that.

07:24.236 --> 07:25.800
Tell it to Jayden.

07:25.800 --> 07:26.633
- Jayden?

07:26.633 --> 07:28.770
- What she means, sir, is
that I'm a biology major.

07:28.770 --> 07:30.860
I wanna be a sports medicine doctor.

07:30.860 --> 07:32.770
- Well, as a guy who's experienced a heap

07:32.770 --> 07:35.610
of sports injuries, I say, bravo.

07:35.610 --> 07:36.460
- Thank you, sir.

07:37.560 --> 07:41.000
- Just remembered I'm gonna
eat at his house tonight.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.350
His parents invited me.

07:42.350 --> 07:44.030
- But you're gonna miss
out on the fabulous fish

07:44.030 --> 07:45.720
your father caught for us.

07:45.720 --> 07:47.230
He toiled on the river.

07:47.230 --> 07:48.860
- And she doesn't know the half of it.

07:48.860 --> 07:50.170
- Then save me some, okay?

07:50.170 --> 07:53.220
- Wait, Becky, I could call
my mom and dad and explain.

07:53.220 --> 07:54.053
They'll understand.

07:54.053 --> 07:55.090
- [Becky] Jayden, it's their anniversary.

07:55.090 --> 07:56.570
- I know but it's the 23rd,

07:56.570 --> 07:57.970
and plus I already told 'em that.

07:57.970 --> 08:01.560
- Stop, Caleb and Grace
have us beat on this one.

08:01.560 --> 08:03.780
You two go have dinner with them tonight.

08:03.780 --> 08:04.990
Case closed.

08:04.990 --> 08:08.770
- Okay, but remember I wanna
try some fish, so save me some.

08:08.770 --> 08:11.410
- Becky, there's enough
here to feed the multitudes,

08:11.410 --> 08:13.160
you got nothing to worry about.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.200
- Okay, then we're out of here.

08:15.200 --> 08:16.609
Love you, guys.
- Bye.

08:16.609 --> 08:18.455
- Love you too.

08:18.455 --> 08:19.490
(gentle music)

08:19.490 --> 08:21.463
Jayden is so nice, isn't he?

08:21.463 --> 08:23.560
- He's a good kid.

08:23.560 --> 08:24.993
- Becky seems very happy.

08:26.410 --> 08:27.660
I'm just glad she didn't find out

08:27.660 --> 08:30.400
about our night of
terror until it was over.

08:30.400 --> 08:32.690
You know how she adores you and Tom.

08:32.690 --> 08:33.803
- We adore her.

08:35.400 --> 08:37.100
- Tommy changed from it overnight.

08:38.380 --> 08:40.539
It's like he instantly matured.

08:40.539 --> 08:43.389
- Extreme danger can do that to a person.

08:43.389 --> 08:45.780
- He's not the only
one who's gotten older,

08:45.780 --> 08:47.483
I know it put five years on me.

08:50.381 --> 08:52.483
- (sighs) Nah, you're mistaken,

08:53.350 --> 08:54.950
and you're still my yellow rose.

08:56.500 --> 08:59.400
- The worst thing is knowing
how badly I treated you, Joe.

09:00.400 --> 09:01.443
I really lost it.

09:04.120 --> 09:07.770
- Carrie, it was just a
moment, fleeting moment.

09:07.770 --> 09:09.300
It doesn't mean anything.

09:09.300 --> 09:12.233
Doesn't matter to me.

09:12.233 --> 09:14.893
To me it never happened.

09:19.620 --> 09:21.675
- You really mean that?

09:21.675 --> 09:23.842
- I mean it body and soul.

09:27.065 --> 09:29.315
- I love you body and soul.

09:33.140 --> 09:35.420
- Well, I better go shower and change.

09:35.420 --> 09:37.250
Head to the office, have my weekly pow wow

09:37.250 --> 09:38.300
with Dave and Nelson.

09:39.350 --> 09:40.840
You got everything you need for tonight?

09:40.840 --> 09:42.400
Batter, butter, eggs?

09:42.400 --> 09:44.893
- I got everything I need in this world.

09:46.040 --> 09:46.873
- That's good.

09:48.460 --> 09:51.120
Then the Haladin's shall
be dining in tonight.

09:51.120 --> 09:53.787
(Carrie laughs)

09:55.478 --> 09:57.001
(birds chirping)

09:57.001 --> 09:59.501
(door clicks)

10:00.410 --> 10:01.570
- Good afternoon, Sheriff.

10:01.570 --> 10:03.890
Dave and Nelson are waiting
for you in your office.

10:03.890 --> 10:05.250
- As I expected, Harriet.

10:05.250 --> 10:06.250
Any messages?

10:06.250 --> 10:09.110
- Oh, yes, Lester Willis
called from the school board.

10:09.110 --> 10:11.190
He wants you send over a deputy on Friday

10:11.190 --> 10:14.300
to conduct a bicycle safety
class at the elementary school.

10:14.300 --> 10:15.560
- Well, that's important,

10:15.560 --> 10:16.650
so I'll check the schedule

10:16.650 --> 10:18.950
and see who I can free up to go do it.

10:18.950 --> 10:19.940
Anything else?

10:19.940 --> 10:21.387
- Yes, Hank called, he says,

10:21.387 --> 10:23.787
"He has some budget numbers
to crunch with you."

10:24.990 --> 10:27.630
Oh, and there is one other thing, um,

10:27.630 --> 10:31.047
but I think you might wanna
have Dave and Nelson tell you.

10:31.047 --> 10:33.043
Um, it's sensitive.

10:35.100 --> 10:36.460
- Got it.

10:36.460 --> 10:39.000
Be on the lookout for a
delivery from the DOT okay.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.580
- I'll let you know as soon
as it arrives, Sheriff.

10:40.580 --> 10:41.840
- Thank you, Harriet.

10:41.840 --> 10:45.051
(phone ringing)

10:45.051 --> 10:46.490
(door clicks)

10:46.490 --> 10:47.580
Howdy, guys.

10:47.580 --> 10:48.480
- Sheriff.
- Joe.

10:49.955 --> 10:50.905
You heard the news?

10:55.900 --> 10:57.577
- Apparently not.

10:57.577 --> 11:00.053
- Draven Denisen just got
released from Huntsville,

11:00.890 --> 11:03.400
and the news is he's coming
back to Arlettsville.

11:03.400 --> 11:05.250
I got a call from his parole officer.

11:06.620 --> 11:09.590
- Well, he didn't reach
me, so no, I hadn't heard.

11:09.590 --> 11:12.956
- Well, I think we can all
agree he is not a changed man.

11:12.956 --> 11:14.780
- (laughs) About as much as bobcat

11:14.780 --> 11:16.932
can change his bars and spots.

11:16.932 --> 11:19.080
- Well, what do you
wanna do about him, Joe?

11:19.080 --> 11:20.450
I mean you're the one that arrested him

11:20.450 --> 11:21.860
and put him away for 12 years.

11:21.860 --> 11:23.230
- And it should of been longer than that.

11:23.230 --> 11:24.730
That guard he hit almost died.

11:25.680 --> 11:27.700
Poor man was in a coma for days.

11:27.700 --> 11:29.650
Said, "He never was right in the head."

11:30.797 --> 11:32.260
- Well, Draven is a violent man,

11:32.260 --> 11:33.660
there's no doubt about that.

11:34.870 --> 11:37.933
I suppose he's just coming back
because of his son, Hunter.

11:39.260 --> 11:41.603
Maybe he still likes
the fishing around here.

11:42.880 --> 11:45.490
- Maybe he still likes he ex-wife Laura.

11:45.490 --> 11:48.420
- Yeah, maybe, that wouldn't
surprise me, not one bit.

11:48.420 --> 11:50.290
So that settles it, he
has plenty of reasons

11:50.290 --> 11:51.653
to return to Arlettsville.

11:52.540 --> 11:54.150
- Well, what do you
wanna do about him, Joe?

11:54.150 --> 11:56.667
I mean what's our M.O. on this one?

11:56.667 --> 11:59.040
- (sighs) Well, you know
we can't surveil him.

11:59.040 --> 12:00.400
We'll keep our eyes and ears open,

12:00.400 --> 12:03.170
we'll ask our friends in the
community to do the same.

12:03.170 --> 12:05.173
We need stay vigilant and we will.

12:06.600 --> 12:09.020
When is uh, Draven expected to arrive?

12:09.020 --> 12:12.210
- Tomorrow on the afternoon
bus from San Antonio,

12:12.210 --> 12:13.263
so says the PO.

12:14.360 --> 12:15.870
- Well, this kind of thing
happens all the time,

12:15.870 --> 12:17.790
and it happens everywhere.

12:17.790 --> 12:20.950
Draven Denisen is bad to the bone,

12:20.950 --> 12:24.333
that's our operating premise,
we'll just take it from there.

12:24.333 --> 12:27.416
(bus engine humming)

12:28.649 --> 12:31.316
(door clanging)

12:40.734 --> 12:43.401
(ominous music)

12:46.334 --> 12:47.584
Draven Denisen.

12:50.710 --> 12:51.860
- Well, howdy, Sheriff.

12:52.910 --> 12:56.363
You here to greet me, to wish me well.

12:57.680 --> 13:00.820
I bet you're hoping I make a fresh start.

13:00.820 --> 13:02.270
Isn't that right, Sheriff?

13:02.270 --> 13:04.620
But I gotta tell you I
wish you would of brought

13:04.620 --> 13:06.600
that pretty little wife of yours along.

13:06.600 --> 13:08.673
Man, Sheriff, I'd be lying if I told you

13:08.673 --> 13:11.790
that she didn't cross
my mind plenty of times

13:11.790 --> 13:13.220
when I was in the big house.

13:13.220 --> 13:17.387
A man has got to keep his juices flowing.

13:17.387 --> 13:18.480
Isn't that right, Sheriff?

13:18.480 --> 13:20.340
Hey, what about that big guy?

13:20.340 --> 13:21.330
The big lumbering klutz

13:21.330 --> 13:24.390
who's about as (tongue
clicking) smart as fishing bait?

13:24.390 --> 13:25.223
What was his name?

13:25.223 --> 13:28.600
Was his name uh, Gomer?

13:28.600 --> 13:29.670
Was that it?

13:29.670 --> 13:32.110
He still work for you, Sheriff?

13:32.110 --> 13:37.110
The other guy, the uh,
Howdy Doody with the teeth,

13:37.500 --> 13:40.553
shit eating grin, he
still around, Sheriff?

13:42.410 --> 13:44.290
You know how to pick 'em.

13:44.290 --> 13:47.933
- Whoa, that's enough, Draven.

13:50.160 --> 13:52.500
You might of spent 12
years writing that speech

13:52.500 --> 13:54.583
but it's just the punk in you coming out.

13:55.750 --> 13:56.853
I'm not interested.

13:58.070 --> 14:00.170
Here's what we both do know,

14:00.170 --> 14:02.653
one, you haven't changed.

14:03.930 --> 14:08.930
Two, you're here, nothing
I can do about it yet.

14:09.990 --> 14:13.233
Three, I'll be watching you like a hawk.

14:14.840 --> 14:19.840
Four, I don't put anything
past you, not a damn thing.

14:21.780 --> 14:25.410
If I left anything out, you
be sure and let me know.

14:27.039 --> 14:29.380
(tongue clicking)

14:29.380 --> 14:30.220
- Will do, Sheriff.

14:30.220 --> 14:35.210
Sheriff, say hi to the
missus for me, would you?

14:39.817 --> 14:42.817
(door bell ringing)

14:46.876 --> 14:48.990
(door clicks)

14:48.990 --> 14:51.340
- Sheriff, is everything all right?

14:51.340 --> 14:52.840
- There's no emergency, Laura.

14:53.910 --> 14:56.706
I need to talk to you about
your ex-husband, Draven.

14:56.706 --> 14:57.539
May I come in?

14:58.740 --> 14:59.790
- Of course, Sheriff.

15:04.610 --> 15:07.027
(door bangs)

15:09.670 --> 15:10.503
- Thank you.

15:17.486 --> 15:19.870
Were you aware that
Draven got out of prison?

15:19.870 --> 15:22.163
He arrived here by bus this afternoon.

15:23.640 --> 15:26.253
- I was informed of it
by his parole officer.

15:27.410 --> 15:29.980
- So Hunter knows too then?

15:29.980 --> 15:30.973
- Yes, he does.

15:32.320 --> 15:33.720
- How does he feel about it?

15:33.720 --> 15:34.823
- Towards his father?

15:35.690 --> 15:37.113
- Towards his father, yes.

15:38.724 --> 15:41.723
If you don't mind me asking
how does he get along with you?

15:45.390 --> 15:47.890
- His attitude towards
his father is unclear

15:47.890 --> 15:52.400
but his attitude towards
me just plain stinks.

15:52.400 --> 15:54.040
It has for some time.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.503
- He lives here with you doesn't he?

15:55.503 --> 15:59.603
- Yes, he does, but I
have no control over him.

16:00.920 --> 16:03.103
He's 18 now, do you know that?

16:04.090 --> 16:08.420
A legal adult, so I can't
make him do anything.

16:08.420 --> 16:09.980
- But you're still his mother,

16:09.980 --> 16:12.280
and this is still your house.

16:12.280 --> 16:15.803
- I hear you, Sheriff, but
it doesn't matter to him,

16:17.522 --> 16:18.773
I get no respect.

16:19.640 --> 16:21.433
I'm lucky he doesn't.

16:23.470 --> 16:24.833
- Lucky he doesn't what?

16:28.850 --> 16:32.623
Laura, we've know each other a
long time, since high school,

16:33.460 --> 16:36.550
you were Carrie's best friend,
then you became my friend.

16:36.550 --> 16:41.060
I need to hear you say
that you will tell me

16:41.060 --> 16:42.960
if Hunter ever gets physical with you.

16:43.830 --> 16:46.730
I won't arrest him but I will talk to him.

16:46.730 --> 16:50.823
- All right, Joe, I'll tell you.

16:52.120 --> 16:55.930
And I know I haven't kept up
with you and Carrie very well,

16:55.930 --> 16:58.990
it's not because my
feelings for you changed,

16:58.990 --> 17:01.023
it's because I've been down, Joe.

17:02.460 --> 17:03.773
I've been down on myself.

17:06.020 --> 17:09.349
I just haven't felt like
I'd be good for anybody.

17:09.349 --> 17:10.250
Do you understand?

17:12.900 --> 17:13.733
- I do, Laura.

17:15.366 --> 17:17.210
But don't keep it all on yourself,

17:17.210 --> 17:19.383
we're just as much to blame as you are.

17:21.170 --> 17:25.430
Now listen, I want you to
call me if you hear anything

17:25.430 --> 17:27.460
you think that I should know,

17:27.460 --> 17:30.283
whether you hear it
directly or second hand.

17:31.790 --> 17:36.393
If you ever think that you're
in danger call me immediately.

17:39.540 --> 17:40.453
- I will, Joe.

17:41.400 --> 17:43.750
And I want you to know
that I'm grateful to you

17:44.890 --> 17:46.270
for that and more.

17:46.270 --> 17:48.650
I just appreciate you so much.

17:48.650 --> 17:50.163
Time hasn't changed you.

17:51.091 --> 17:54.090
- (laughs) I don't know about that.

17:54.090 --> 17:55.787
I am getting old.

17:55.787 --> 17:58.040
- Oh, no, you're not, Joe.

17:58.040 --> 17:59.333
Time's been good to you.

18:01.232 --> 18:02.410
- Well, if my joints could talk

18:02.410 --> 18:05.340
they'd be telling you
different believe me.

18:05.340 --> 18:07.530
- I remember that time
you sprained your wrist

18:07.530 --> 18:09.510
at the football game.

18:09.510 --> 18:12.273
- I remember it too because that hurt.

18:14.190 --> 18:15.640
- They announced that
they were keeping you

18:15.640 --> 18:17.920
on the sidelines to ice it,

18:17.920 --> 18:20.423
hoping that you'd be able
to get back in the game,

18:21.603 --> 18:26.075
and you did, throwing the ball
for the winning touchdown.

18:26.075 --> 18:28.023
- I wobbled it pretty bad as I recall.

18:28.913 --> 18:32.533
But lucky for me Bill Mesher
was one hell of a receiver.

18:34.550 --> 18:36.780
- Then it occurred to me that
you should have an icepack

18:36.780 --> 18:40.830
for the ride home, so I
ran out and got you one.

18:40.830 --> 18:42.033
- Wait, you did that?

18:43.320 --> 18:45.563
I recall Carrie had an icepack for me.

18:46.800 --> 18:50.023
- Oh, she did, but I'm the
one who ran out and got it.

18:51.199 --> 18:52.880
It was my idea.

18:52.880 --> 18:55.290
- But why didn't she tell me?

18:55.290 --> 18:57.290
- [Laura] I told her not to.

18:57.290 --> 18:58.423
- Why did you do that?

18:59.470 --> 19:04.203
- I didn't want it to
seem you know intrusive.

19:06.050 --> 19:07.603
- Thank you for thinking of me.

19:09.650 --> 19:11.100
Now let me tell you a secret,

19:11.950 --> 19:13.803
I carry two business cards on me,

19:14.910 --> 19:18.453
one with my personal cellphone
number and one without.

19:19.400 --> 19:20.800
You're getting the one with.

19:23.570 --> 19:25.403
- I really appreciate this, Joe.

19:27.580 --> 19:29.003
I feel a lot safer now.

19:32.344 --> 19:36.560
I just, I just wish there was
something I could do for you.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.680
- (laughs) Well.

19:41.680 --> 19:46.600
- I know, I'll call my friend, Carrie,

19:46.600 --> 19:48.173
and take her out to lunch.

19:49.530 --> 19:51.391
- She'd like that.

19:51.391 --> 19:53.190
Well, I better go, Laura.

19:53.190 --> 19:55.940
But you'll be hearing from
me again soon and often.

19:55.940 --> 19:57.040
Is that okay with you?

19:58.040 --> 20:00.285
- Anything for Joltin' Joe.

20:00.285 --> 20:02.730
- (laughs) Then it's a deal.

20:02.730 --> 20:04.003
I'll show myself out.

20:05.480 --> 20:07.873
Now you take care of yourself, Laura.

20:09.960 --> 20:10.950
- You too, Joe.

20:10.950 --> 20:12.560
- So I'm at locker when Scott Larson

20:12.560 --> 20:14.460
walks by with his girlfriend, Heather,

20:15.480 --> 20:20.035
and they're talking,
laughing, yakking it up,

20:20.035 --> 20:22.630
and then he just bumps into me.

20:22.630 --> 20:24.270
He turns around and gives
me the quickest sorry

20:24.270 --> 20:25.940
that anyone's ever said,

20:25.940 --> 20:28.820
and then I dropped my books,
and he picked 'em up for me,

20:28.820 --> 20:29.660
and he hands 'em to me.

20:29.660 --> 20:34.660
And then he says, "Here ya
go," like I'm some little kid

20:35.080 --> 20:36.470
or some kind of retard.

20:36.470 --> 20:39.590
- Dude, I highly doubt
that's what he meant.

20:39.590 --> 20:43.550
- And then they just walked
away like nothing happened.

20:43.550 --> 20:45.556
- Nothing did happen, Chase.

20:45.556 --> 20:47.227
It was just a mishap.

20:47.227 --> 20:48.910
- Just a mishap.

20:48.910 --> 20:52.010
I'm sure they're laughing
about it and talking about me.

20:52.010 --> 20:54.350
- There you go again about
people talking about you, dude.

20:54.350 --> 20:57.450
You know it's a big wide world out there

20:57.450 --> 20:59.910
there's more to talk about
then just Chase Garick.

20:59.910 --> 21:01.430
- Hunter, I can feel it in my bones

21:01.430 --> 21:03.300
when someone's talking about me.

21:03.300 --> 21:04.383
I got the gift that way,

21:04.383 --> 21:07.684
and I know you might not
believe it but you should,

21:07.684 --> 21:08.820
and someday you will.

21:08.820 --> 21:10.090
- Yeah, whatever, man.

21:10.090 --> 21:12.490
(car horn honking)

21:12.490 --> 21:13.620
I gotta go.

21:13.620 --> 21:15.640
- Uh, hey, Hunter, uh,
do you wanna go shooting

21:15.640 --> 21:17.120
with me on Saturday?

21:17.120 --> 21:18.920
They're have a special at the range.

21:19.938 --> 21:21.388
- I don't, I don't know, man.

21:24.987 --> 21:25.960
(hand banging)

21:25.960 --> 21:27.473
Got a new truck already, huh?

21:28.340 --> 21:33.110
- Let's say a guy owed me
favor and he wisely granted it.

21:33.110 --> 21:33.943
- There you go.

21:35.000 --> 21:35.833
- Get in.

21:35.833 --> 21:37.345
Let's get out of here.

21:37.345 --> 21:38.262
(truck door bangs)

21:38.262 --> 21:40.310
(Draven laughing)

21:40.310 --> 21:41.849
Nice to see you, boy.
- Yeah.

21:41.849 --> 21:45.099
(truck engine roaring)

21:47.600 --> 21:48.433
- So who's that?

21:49.820 --> 21:53.120
- That's the kid I wrote
you about, Chase Garick.

21:53.120 --> 21:55.540
Kid's so fucking paranoid.

21:55.540 --> 21:57.040
- Is that the kid that
thinks everybody's laughing

21:57.040 --> 21:58.440
at him behind his back?

21:58.440 --> 22:02.140
- Yeah, but I mean really
he's got it all wrong.

22:02.140 --> 22:04.150
He always says, "People are
laughing at him and stuff,"

22:04.150 --> 22:08.050
but really they're just
waiting for him to go postal.

22:08.050 --> 22:10.840
- Going postal, man, I haven't heard

22:10.840 --> 22:12.783
that expression in a long time.

22:14.590 --> 22:15.680
Hey, how's school?

22:15.680 --> 22:16.723
- School's boring.

22:18.600 --> 22:20.160
- How's your mother?

22:20.160 --> 22:21.343
- She's boring too.

22:22.832 --> 22:25.270
- [Draven] And that's all you got to say?

22:25.270 --> 22:26.560
- About her?

22:26.560 --> 22:27.393
- [Draven] Well, we ain't talking

22:27.393 --> 22:28.747
about Melania Trump are we?

22:28.747 --> 22:30.083
(Hunter laughs)

22:30.083 --> 22:32.273
- [Hunter] What do you
wanna know about her?

22:34.320 --> 22:36.120
- She uh, seeing anyone?

22:36.120 --> 22:38.967
- I don't think she has
any of those feelings left.

22:38.967 --> 22:41.120
(Draven laughs)

22:41.120 --> 22:43.420
- You mean I put her off men completely.

22:43.420 --> 22:46.250
- The whole gender.

22:46.250 --> 22:48.140
- Well, ain't that a shame.

22:48.140 --> 22:48.973
- Yeah.

22:52.001 --> 22:52.860
(Draven sighs)

22:52.860 --> 22:55.283
Hey, what are you gonna do now?

22:56.650 --> 22:57.790
- [Draven] About what?

22:57.790 --> 22:59.180
- Work.

22:59.180 --> 23:01.543
- Turn over a new leaf and get a job.

23:02.940 --> 23:04.840
- What kind of job you thinking about?

23:05.957 --> 23:08.440
- The kind that'll hire an ex-con.

23:08.440 --> 23:09.990
- That's gotta suck.

23:09.990 --> 23:10.873
- Yeah, it does.

23:13.290 --> 23:14.790
But it won't last forever.

23:18.160 --> 23:19.634
- Really.

23:19.634 --> 23:20.467
(Draven laughs)

23:20.467 --> 23:22.070
(Hunter scoffs)

23:22.070 --> 23:22.983
- [Draven] Yeah.

23:23.925 --> 23:26.675
(birds chirping)

23:29.459 --> 23:31.750
(ominous music)

23:31.750 --> 23:33.150
Didn't I buy you that purse?

23:34.607 --> 23:36.747
- Draven.

23:36.747 --> 23:38.680
What are you doing here?

23:38.680 --> 23:39.513
You found me.

23:40.771 --> 23:42.221
- I just came to see my wife.

23:44.033 --> 23:45.110
- I'm not your wife.

23:46.523 --> 23:51.300
- As I recall we were married
in the house of the Lord,

23:51.300 --> 23:54.680
and you made a vow to have and to hold,

23:54.680 --> 23:57.800
to love and to cherish,
to comfort and protect,

23:57.800 --> 24:01.510
to honor and defend,
for better or for worse,

24:01.510 --> 24:06.433
rich or poor, sickness and in
health, till death do us part.

24:07.774 --> 24:10.990
- The man I made that vow
to doesn't exists anymore.

24:10.990 --> 24:12.893
He became someone else.

24:14.320 --> 24:15.710
- Maybe you should just give him a chance

24:15.710 --> 24:16.670
and see what happens.

24:16.670 --> 24:17.990
- [Laura] Get your hands off me.

24:17.990 --> 24:19.023
- [Draven] Just listen to me, Laura.

24:19.023 --> 24:20.810
- [Laura] I don't wanna listen to you!

24:20.810 --> 24:21.893
- Listen.
- No!

24:23.330 --> 24:26.020
- Mam, do you need some help?

24:26.020 --> 24:27.920
- Look nobody asked you for anything.

24:27.920 --> 24:31.640
- Why yes, I actually do need some help.

24:31.640 --> 24:33.320
The truth is I've never been really good

24:33.320 --> 24:34.650
at backing up cars.

24:34.650 --> 24:36.950
Could you back this out for
me so that I can go home?

24:36.950 --> 24:38.180
- Yes, mam.

24:38.180 --> 24:39.210
- Trevor.

24:39.210 --> 24:41.960
- Kaitlyn, it'll be all right,
just stay where you are.

24:48.668 --> 24:52.000
(car door clicks)

24:52.000 --> 24:54.070
(car door bangs)

24:54.070 --> 24:57.153
(car engine humming)

25:18.627 --> 25:19.520
It's ready, mam.

25:19.520 --> 25:22.020
- Here.
- No, mam, it's all right.

25:22.020 --> 25:23.230
- Are you sure?

25:23.230 --> 25:24.063
- I'm positive.

25:25.650 --> 25:28.260
- Well, thank you, thank you, thank you.

25:33.549 --> 25:36.299
(car door bangs)

25:43.120 --> 25:45.650
- Well, it looks like you did
your good deed for the day.

25:45.650 --> 25:48.010
- Mister, I don't know who you are

25:48.010 --> 25:49.300
but unless you're totin',

25:49.300 --> 25:51.410
you ain't got a speck of leverage on me.

25:51.410 --> 25:53.793
And crap from you I ain't taking.

25:54.675 --> 25:55.508
- Is that right?

25:57.563 --> 25:58.396
Are you sure?

25:59.909 --> 26:00.867
(Kaitlyn gasps)

26:00.867 --> 26:03.534
(ominous music)

26:06.260 --> 26:08.207
It's your lucky day, Jughead,
'cause I ain't totin'.

26:09.730 --> 26:11.570
- Trevor, let's go.

26:11.570 --> 26:12.403
- Thanks for pitching in.

26:12.403 --> 26:14.190
Y'all come back now ya hear?

26:18.894 --> 26:22.227
(mower engine whirring)

26:47.348 --> 26:50.015
(ominous music)

26:58.341 --> 27:00.514
(insects chirping)
(birds chirping)

27:00.514 --> 27:02.772
Well, I know this ain't no social call.

27:02.772 --> 27:03.930
What's on your mind, Sheriff.

27:03.930 --> 27:05.780
- You are, Draven.

27:05.780 --> 27:09.510
You're right this is no social call,

27:09.510 --> 27:12.690
it's business, Sheriff's business.

27:12.690 --> 27:16.570
Here's what it is, you need
to stay away from Laura.

27:16.570 --> 27:17.403
- And what did she tell you?

27:17.403 --> 27:19.800
That little bitch.

27:19.800 --> 27:21.610
- She told me plenty.

27:21.610 --> 27:24.150
You've been stalking
her, and harassing her.

27:24.150 --> 27:26.460
And here's what you need to know,

27:26.460 --> 27:28.237
we're filing a restraining
order against you,

27:28.237 --> 27:31.130
and the judge, he'll listen to me.

27:31.130 --> 27:32.183
We're good friends.

27:33.360 --> 27:36.530
- You're good friends with
everyone around here, Sheriff.

27:36.530 --> 27:40.730
- Practically everyone
including Baxter Monroe,

27:40.730 --> 27:42.710
the owner of this business.

27:42.710 --> 27:46.290
One word from me, you
don't work here anymore.

27:46.290 --> 27:48.360
Also including Reese Wilkins,

27:48.360 --> 27:50.710
the owner of the place you're staying in.

27:50.710 --> 27:54.140
One word from me, you
don't live there anymore.

27:54.140 --> 27:57.973
You don't go to her door,
and you do not approach her,

27:58.830 --> 28:03.123
not on the street, not in a
store, and not in a parking lot.

28:04.110 --> 28:07.313
Your harassment of Laura stops now.

28:09.350 --> 28:13.030
- Tell me, Sheriff, are you
going the way of the Mormons?

28:13.030 --> 28:15.890
'Cause Laura is a fine
piece of ass, isn't she?

28:15.890 --> 28:17.260
- She's the mother of your son.

28:17.260 --> 28:18.730
- Yeah, I know that,

28:18.730 --> 28:20.823
but I know you notice the other, right?

28:22.020 --> 28:25.450
Tell me, Sheriff, you banging my wife?

28:25.450 --> 28:26.800
Is that what this is about?

28:31.470 --> 28:33.500
- Just stay away from her, Draven.

28:33.500 --> 28:34.740
Don't approach her again

28:35.700 --> 28:38.133
because if you do I will come for you,

28:39.278 --> 28:41.010
and I will crush you,

28:41.010 --> 28:44.660
and there is nothing you can
be more certain of than that.

28:45.923 --> 28:48.590
(ominous music)

28:49.926 --> 28:52.676
(birds chirping)

28:56.003 --> 28:58.240
- [Hunter] Hey, Ma,
have you seen my phone?

28:58.240 --> 29:00.140
- No, when's the last time you had it?

29:02.000 --> 29:04.660
- I know I had it with me in Dad's car.

29:04.660 --> 29:06.554
- Could you of left it there?

29:06.554 --> 29:07.387
- I mighta.

29:09.200 --> 29:11.860
- Well, if he had your
phone he'd have to call me

29:11.860 --> 29:14.360
to tell you that he found
it and that's a problem.

29:15.770 --> 29:16.743
- I suppose.

29:18.340 --> 29:19.520
- Well, I better call your number,

29:19.520 --> 29:20.820
maybe we'll hear it ringing.

29:20.820 --> 29:21.653
- Yeah.

29:25.670 --> 29:28.620
- Wait, I better not,
your father might answer.

29:28.620 --> 29:30.040
I'll have Sam from next door do it.

29:30.040 --> 29:30.873
He won't mind.

29:30.873 --> 29:33.700
- No, just give me the phone, I can do it.

29:33.700 --> 29:36.080
It's not gonna matter
if he hears my voice!

29:36.080 --> 29:38.803
- But it would still look
like it's me calling,

29:39.860 --> 29:42.250
so let's just have Sam
from next door do it.

29:42.250 --> 29:43.750
It won't hurt anything.

29:43.750 --> 29:45.390
I'm sure he won't mind.

29:45.390 --> 29:48.143
You just stay here and
listen for the ring, okay?

29:49.090 --> 29:50.320
- [Hunter] Sure, Mom.

29:50.320 --> 29:52.800
Whatever, whatever you say.

29:52.800 --> 29:53.730
- Thank you.

29:53.730 --> 29:54.680
I'll be right back.

30:04.840 --> 30:07.507
(phone ringing)

30:14.670 --> 30:15.503
- Yeah.

30:15.503 --> 30:18.360
- [Howard] Draven, this Howard
Spears, your parole officer.

30:18.360 --> 30:20.980
We've received a complaint
from Sheriff Joe Haladin

30:20.980 --> 30:24.580
that you've been stalking and
harassing your ex-wife, Laura.

30:24.580 --> 30:26.720
Now that is a parole violation,

30:26.720 --> 30:29.200
and you may be going back
to prison because of it.

30:29.200 --> 30:30.670
We've opened an inquiry.

30:30.670 --> 30:33.980
There'll be a hearing in
two weeks, you must attend.

30:33.980 --> 30:37.130
If you don't a warrant will
be issued for your arrest.

30:37.130 --> 30:38.650
And if you are found culpable

30:38.650 --> 30:41.420
you will be taken into custody on the spot

30:41.420 --> 30:44.560
by the constable, and
transported back to Huntsville.

30:44.560 --> 30:45.727
Do you understand?

30:45.727 --> 30:46.863
- Yeah, I understand.

30:46.863 --> 30:47.696
- [Howard] Good.

30:47.696 --> 30:50.670
You better come, Draven,
and bring your toothbrush,

30:50.670 --> 30:53.570
and don't leave the county
before then, you got it?

30:53.570 --> 30:55.490
- Yeah, I got that.

30:55.490 --> 30:56.410
- [Howard] Good.

30:56.410 --> 30:59.000
Now word of advice, Draven,

30:59.000 --> 31:02.143
don't make this harder than it has to be.

31:08.472 --> 31:11.139
(ominous music)

31:34.943 --> 31:36.250
- Hey, what's up?

31:36.250 --> 31:37.550
- Hey, Chase, it's Hunter.

31:38.600 --> 31:41.080
- I know who you are, says it on my phone.

31:41.080 --> 31:43.680
- [Draven] Are you fucking drunk?

31:43.680 --> 31:47.763
- No, I ain't drunk, just drinking.

31:48.990 --> 31:51.967
- Hey, man, you asked what
was up, so I'm gonna tell you,

31:51.967 --> 31:53.200
now you're not gonna be happy

31:53.200 --> 31:55.420
but you know those kids that you say

31:55.420 --> 31:56.940
are always talking about you
behind your back you know?

31:56.940 --> 31:59.540
Well, they's at it again.

31:59.540 --> 32:00.373
- [Chase] Like who?

32:00.373 --> 32:03.090
- Well, that you know
Trevor, the athlete one

32:03.090 --> 32:05.540
likes to wear his Letterman jacket all,

32:05.540 --> 32:08.210
you know uh, uh, what's his last name?

32:08.210 --> 32:09.043
- Mckennie.

32:09.043 --> 32:09.876
What he'd say?

32:09.876 --> 32:12.550
- He said, "That you
should be the poster boy

32:12.550 --> 32:15.920
for involuntary sterilization."

32:15.920 --> 32:17.480
Man, do you even know what that is?

32:17.480 --> 32:18.420
- Yeah, I'm not a idiot.

32:18.420 --> 32:20.080
Keep going.

32:20.080 --> 32:22.470
- Well, he said, "You can only count to 20

32:22.470 --> 32:24.130
if you was barefoot,

32:24.130 --> 32:28.290
and that you are so dumb
blondes tell jokes about you."

32:28.290 --> 32:30.460
That guy was laughing.

32:30.460 --> 32:32.310
- Is there anyone else?

32:32.310 --> 32:33.650
- [Draven] What, telling jokes about you?

32:33.650 --> 32:34.630
Oh, hell yeah.

32:34.630 --> 32:37.090
The Sheriff's own daughter, Becky.

32:37.090 --> 32:39.880
She said, "That you must
of snuck into the gene pool

32:39.880 --> 32:43.500
when the lifeguard was
dabbing zinc on his nose."

32:43.500 --> 32:45.590
I ain't even heard that one before.

32:47.532 --> 32:49.597
Hey, Chase, you there, man?

32:54.024 --> 32:54.857
- Yeah.

32:55.887 --> 32:59.137
- [Draven] Dude, what are you gonna do?

33:03.480 --> 33:04.313
- Get even.

33:05.780 --> 33:06.800
- Yeah.

33:06.800 --> 33:09.700
So I'm your friend, and I
just thought you should know.

33:09.700 --> 33:12.200
I mean you let people go around
talking about you like that

33:12.200 --> 33:15.130
and what the hell do you have left?

33:15.130 --> 33:17.158
What do you have left to live for?

33:17.158 --> 33:18.253
You know what I'm saying?

33:18.253 --> 33:20.090
- [Chase] I gotta go.

33:20.090 --> 33:21.907
- Yeah, man, I'll see you tomorrow.

33:30.757 --> 33:33.424
(phone beeping)

33:37.730 --> 33:41.630
- Bedford, yeah, I think I
got a job for you and Buell.

33:41.630 --> 33:43.280
I think it's going down tomorrow.

33:44.200 --> 33:45.453
Yeah, man, here's the scoop.

33:46.866 --> 33:49.449
(gun whooshes)

33:58.258 --> 34:00.841
(gun clicking)

34:01.768 --> 34:04.643
(insects chirping)
(birds chirping)

34:04.643 --> 34:07.310
(dirt thudding)

34:10.196 --> 34:13.054
(gate creaking)

34:13.054 --> 34:15.722
(gate clanging)

34:17.996 --> 34:20.830
- [Joe] What, you becoming a farmer now?

34:20.830 --> 34:23.123
- Maybe. (laughs)

34:24.659 --> 34:28.350
Yeah, it's a new career. (laughing)

34:28.350 --> 34:29.909
What are you doing here?

34:29.909 --> 34:31.560
Ain't you supposed to be at work?

34:32.851 --> 34:35.040
- [Joe] I'm on my way
to Austin for SAT meet.

34:35.040 --> 34:40.040
- Ah, Sheriff's Association
of Texas founded in 1874.

34:42.620 --> 34:44.170
I was at the inaugural meeting.

34:45.021 --> 34:47.600
- [Joe] (chuckles) Well, I gotta say, Pop,

34:47.600 --> 34:49.460
you're holding up pretty good.

34:49.460 --> 34:51.013
- Yeah, I take care of myself.

34:53.060 --> 34:55.030
- Listen, I've only got a few minutes

34:55.030 --> 34:57.520
but there is something important
I need to discuss with you.

34:57.520 --> 34:59.000
You mind?

34:59.000 --> 34:59.833
- Sure.

35:02.124 --> 35:03.620
- [Joe] You know the elections coming up.

35:03.620 --> 35:04.453
- Yeah.

35:05.480 --> 35:08.070
- [Joe] This time I won't
be running unopposed.

35:08.070 --> 35:08.903
- What?

35:09.810 --> 35:11.110
Who's running against you?

35:12.250 --> 35:14.973
- [Joe] One of the precinct
commissioners, Greg Stanish.

35:16.060 --> 35:17.885
- That asshole?

35:17.885 --> 35:21.140
(scoffs) You know he's
all hat and no cattle.

35:21.140 --> 35:25.020
He's, he's just a guy with too much time

35:25.020 --> 35:27.570
and too much money on his hands.

35:27.570 --> 35:30.270
He couldn't beat his way out
of a pissed soaked paper,

35:32.820 --> 35:34.420
and he certainly can't beat you.

35:37.040 --> 35:38.310
- Yeah, you're probably right,

35:38.310 --> 35:40.250
but as you said he is loaded,

35:40.250 --> 35:42.450
so I figure I better
take this race serious.

35:46.380 --> 35:51.380
- (sighs) There's something
I never told you before.

35:52.083 --> 35:55.140
(gentle music)

35:55.140 --> 35:57.490
Your mother, may she rest in peace

36:00.720 --> 36:03.173
did not want you
following in my footsteps.

36:06.770 --> 36:11.600
She saw how it affected
me, how it affected her,

36:11.600 --> 36:13.733
how it affected our lives together.

36:18.190 --> 36:20.690
She didn't want the same
thing for you and Carrie.

36:23.230 --> 36:24.853
Plus you being her only child.

36:29.440 --> 36:32.067
But I weighed on her not to
say anything to you about it

36:32.067 --> 36:33.823
and that puts it mildly.

36:37.401 --> 36:39.701
I'm not proud of the way
I treated that woman,

36:42.792 --> 36:44.542
and you know how I was at the time.

36:47.700 --> 36:49.900
- Well, don't beat
yourself up too bad, Pop.

36:51.080 --> 36:52.420
Even if she would of said somethin',

36:52.420 --> 36:55.330
I was still gonna follow
you no matter what.

36:55.330 --> 36:56.880
You know how I was at the time.

37:00.010 --> 37:00.843
- Any regrets?

37:02.000 --> 37:03.553
- Nah, Pop, you know better than that.

37:03.553 --> 37:05.603
It's in my blood, same as yours.

37:07.320 --> 37:08.460
Plus I've learned to cope better

37:08.460 --> 37:10.410
with the parts of the job I don't like.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.153
I'm all right, I really am.

37:17.600 --> 37:19.950
Which brings me to what
I came here to ask you.

37:22.187 --> 37:23.700
Will you be my campaign manager?

37:23.700 --> 37:25.850
If you need to think
about it I understand.

37:27.129 --> 37:28.779
- I don't need to think about it.

37:30.580 --> 37:33.363
You got my answer right
now, of course I will.

37:35.068 --> 37:38.430
I got news for you he cannot run

37:38.430 --> 37:40.663
for precinct commissioner
at the same time,

37:41.700 --> 37:45.808
so Greg Stanish we're gonna banish.

37:45.808 --> 37:48.170
(Joe laughing)

37:48.170 --> 37:50.620
- I appreciate the thought, Pop.

37:50.620 --> 37:51.909
Does sweeten the deal.

37:51.909 --> 37:52.950
- Yep.

37:52.950 --> 37:55.320
- Listen, I'll be gone
for the rest of the day

37:55.320 --> 37:56.670
but I'll call you tomorrow
and we'll get started, okay?

37:56.670 --> 37:57.883
- Yeah, I'll be waiting.

37:58.720 --> 38:00.000
- [Joe] All right, see ya tomorrow.

38:00.000 --> 38:01.100
- Chompin' at the bit.

38:05.570 --> 38:06.790
- Hey.

38:06.790 --> 38:07.990
- Where is everyone?

38:07.990 --> 38:08.970
Why aren't you uniform?

38:08.970 --> 38:10.080
They won't let you practice.

38:10.080 --> 38:12.592
- You know it got called
off, the coach had a meeting.

38:12.592 --> 38:13.425
- Oh.
- Yeah.

38:13.425 --> 38:14.310
- Bummer.

38:14.310 --> 38:15.991
Well, what do you wanna do instead?

38:15.991 --> 38:17.360
- Well, I had this thought in mind

38:17.360 --> 38:18.490
that your friend, Savannah,

38:18.490 --> 38:20.130
you know she needed
help writing this song,

38:20.130 --> 38:22.030
so if she's available I can do it now.

38:23.063 --> 38:24.537
- You're so nice.

38:24.537 --> 38:27.270
Serves you right for being so talented.

38:27.270 --> 38:30.080
Music, sports, academics,

38:30.080 --> 38:31.910
you're the go-to person for everything.

38:31.910 --> 38:32.760
- Not everything.

38:34.135 --> 38:36.135
- Well, you're my go-to person for this.

38:38.128 --> 38:38.980
- (laughs) Well, you should feel free

38:38.980 --> 38:40.403
to impose anytime you like.

38:41.381 --> 38:42.500
- Good to know.

38:42.500 --> 38:43.863
- Now let's call Savannah.

38:45.300 --> 38:46.133
- Jayden!

38:47.850 --> 38:48.683
Jayden!

38:50.095 --> 38:51.720
- What does he want?

38:51.720 --> 38:53.513
- I'm not sure, but you stay here.

38:59.510 --> 39:00.780
Hey, what's up, man?

39:00.780 --> 39:02.400
- Where's Trevor?

39:02.400 --> 39:04.100
Why didn't he come to school today?

39:04.100 --> 39:06.360
- Trevor, yeah, he's at UT
today, you know he actually

39:06.360 --> 39:08.200
had another appointment
with the recruiter.

39:08.200 --> 39:10.480
They are definitely interested in my boy.

39:10.480 --> 39:12.410
That's great, isn't it?

39:12.410 --> 39:13.243
- Not for me.

39:14.350 --> 39:15.580
- [Jayden] Is something wrong?

39:15.580 --> 39:17.000
- With what?

39:17.000 --> 39:17.833
- With anything?

39:17.833 --> 39:19.500
Just let me know, and I can help you.

39:19.500 --> 39:20.850
- Ain't nobody can help me.

39:21.840 --> 39:22.963
And nobody can help you either.

39:22.963 --> 39:23.796
(gentle melancholic music)
(woman vocalizing)

39:23.796 --> 39:26.546
(heart pounding)

39:35.379 --> 39:37.712
(gun bangs)

39:46.478 --> 39:49.145
(siren wailing)

39:50.942 --> 39:54.578
(woman vocalizing)

39:54.578 --> 39:56.163
- [Becky] Jayden!

39:56.163 --> 39:57.182
(tires screeching)

39:57.182 --> 39:59.682
(door clicks)

40:00.611 --> 40:03.480
(door bangs)

40:03.480 --> 40:04.313
Jayden!

40:05.560 --> 40:07.210
- How many shooters?
- Just one.

40:08.556 --> 40:11.798
- [Becky] Why did you do this?

40:11.798 --> 40:13.058
- [Chase] Justice.

40:13.058 --> 40:14.057
- Justice?

40:14.057 --> 40:15.362
Jayden never wronged you,

40:15.362 --> 40:17.738
he never wronged anyone!

40:17.738 --> 40:19.961
- [Chase] And what about you, Ms. Haladin?

40:19.961 --> 40:22.280
When was the time that you wronged me?

40:22.280 --> 40:23.850
- You're twisted!

40:23.850 --> 40:24.683
You're out of your mind!

40:24.683 --> 40:27.300
- Well, I'm sure you could
go all day about that,

40:27.300 --> 40:30.160
but the truth is I have
you to kill, then myself,

40:30.160 --> 40:32.510
and time's a wasting!

40:32.510 --> 40:33.711
(gun bangs)

40:33.711 --> 40:36.711
(high-pitched tone)

40:43.333 --> 40:44.591
- Come, come, come here.

40:44.591 --> 40:46.019
It's okay.
- Jayden's dead.

40:46.019 --> 40:47.019
- It's okay.

40:48.780 --> 40:49.613
Is he the only shooter?

40:49.613 --> 40:51.150
Is he the only shooter?

40:51.150 --> 40:52.650
Becky, Becky, are you sure?

40:52.650 --> 40:54.040
- Chase, he's the only one, Chase.

40:54.040 --> 40:55.490
- Okay.

40:55.490 --> 40:56.620
This is Deputy Nelson Harris.

40:56.620 --> 40:58.380
I've got a shooting at
Arlettsville High School.

40:58.380 --> 40:59.910
I've got two students down.

40:59.910 --> 41:01.510
One shot the other, I shot the shooter

41:01.510 --> 41:03.980
right next to the baseball field.

41:03.980 --> 41:06.200
I need backup and EMS now.

41:06.200 --> 41:07.460
All right, Becky, come on,
I'm gonna get you out of here.

41:07.460 --> 41:08.342
All right, let's go, come on.

41:08.342 --> 41:13.342
(gentle brooding music)
(birds chirping)

41:36.763 --> 41:39.596
(car door clicks)

41:41.550 --> 41:44.300
(car door bangs)

41:49.530 --> 41:50.823
Joe.
- Nelson.

41:51.970 --> 41:54.050
- [Nelson] We've had a
shooting at the high school.

41:54.050 --> 41:55.943
One boy's dead, Jayden Wright.

41:56.860 --> 41:58.310
Chase Garick was the shooter.

41:59.360 --> 42:00.810
I shot him dead.

42:00.810 --> 42:01.850
No other casualties.

42:01.850 --> 42:02.870
- Where's Becky?

42:02.870 --> 42:04.100
- She's with me.

42:04.100 --> 42:05.930
I'm driving her home.

42:05.930 --> 42:07.000
- [Joe] Was she hurt?

42:07.000 --> 42:08.520
- [Nelson] No.

42:08.520 --> 42:10.570
But Joe she was in the thick of it.

42:10.570 --> 42:12.500
I got there just in time.

42:12.500 --> 42:14.413
I mean just in time.

42:15.340 --> 42:17.260
- What the hell were they arguing about?

42:17.260 --> 42:18.710
- [Nelson] Apparently nothing.

42:18.710 --> 42:20.320
He was delusional.

42:20.320 --> 42:21.640
He was demented.

42:21.640 --> 42:24.220
- Please put Becky on.
- Yeah.

42:24.220 --> 42:25.270
Becky, it's your dad.

42:27.200 --> 42:28.033
- Dad.

42:28.870 --> 42:30.118
- Are you hurt?

42:30.118 --> 42:31.577
(Becky crying)

42:31.577 --> 42:32.773
- No, Dad, but Jayden's dead.

42:36.033 --> 42:36.883
- (sighs) I know.

42:38.370 --> 42:40.290
I'm so sorry.

42:40.290 --> 42:42.203
I'm devastated, torn apart.

42:43.620 --> 42:46.930
Listen, I need you to do something for me.

42:46.930 --> 42:48.770
I need you to be strong now.

42:48.770 --> 42:51.210
I know it's the hardest thing
I've ever asked you to do,

42:51.210 --> 42:52.610
but will you do that for me?

42:55.558 --> 42:56.475
- I'll try.

42:57.580 --> 42:58.413
- Thank you.

42:59.681 --> 43:00.823
That's all expect.

43:01.690 --> 43:04.140
Listen, I need to get to the high school

43:04.140 --> 43:06.823
but I will come to you and
your mom as soon as I can.

43:08.694 --> 43:10.194
- I know you will.

43:12.130 --> 43:13.343
- I love you, sweetie.

43:14.945 --> 43:16.623
- I love you too, Dad.

43:16.623 --> 43:19.873
(gentle pensive music)

43:20.787 --> 43:23.275
(car engine revving)

43:23.275 --> 43:26.358
(car engine humming)

43:28.179 --> 43:30.929
(brooding music)

43:32.390 --> 43:37.390
(door clicks)
(suspenseful music)

43:39.619 --> 43:41.199
(car door clicks)

43:41.199 --> 43:42.032
(car door bangs)

43:42.032 --> 43:44.699
(keys clanging)

43:47.239 --> 43:50.683
(car engine revving)

43:50.683 --> 43:52.115
(Carrie yells)

43:52.115 --> 43:55.032
(knuckles tapping)

43:56.397 --> 43:59.380
- You're gonna flood it
if you keep doing that.

43:59.380 --> 44:00.647
- Clint, what are you doing here?

44:00.647 --> 44:01.670
Did Joe call you?

44:01.670 --> 44:02.690
Did he tell you to come?

44:02.690 --> 44:05.700
- Joe called me but he didn't
have to tell me to come,

44:05.700 --> 44:07.750
I came here on my own.

44:07.750 --> 44:08.759
- So you know then?

44:08.759 --> 44:09.720
- Yeah.

44:09.720 --> 44:11.750
- Okay, well, I have to go get Becky.

44:11.750 --> 44:15.620
- Let me take you, Carrie, please.

44:15.620 --> 44:16.736
- Okay.

44:16.736 --> 44:21.736
(car door clicks)
(car beeping)

44:23.144 --> 44:25.348
(car door clicks)

44:25.348 --> 44:28.098
(car door bangs)

44:29.588 --> 44:32.043
(car door bangs)

44:32.043 --> 44:33.240
- Uh, we're gonna need to let this

44:33.240 --> 44:35.640
kinda sit here for a minute, all right.

44:37.242 --> 44:39.230
(Carrie sighs)

44:39.230 --> 44:42.823
- Clint, I think I'm losing it.

44:43.836 --> 44:45.760
(Carrie sighs)

44:45.760 --> 44:48.710
- Carrie, I need you to think
about something for a minute.

44:50.630 --> 44:54.491
You're a Haladin, Haladin's don't lose it.

44:54.491 --> 44:56.310
(Carrie sighs)

44:56.310 --> 44:58.650
Now remember Becky did not get hurt.

44:58.650 --> 44:59.793
Becky's okay.

45:00.980 --> 45:03.713
All right, she's out of harm's way.

45:05.543 --> 45:06.620
(Carrie sighs)

45:06.620 --> 45:08.323
Carrie, we're the lucky ones.

45:10.120 --> 45:11.570
Just think about what the Wrights

45:11.570 --> 45:12.499
are going through right now.

45:12.499 --> 45:16.916
- Oh, god. (sighs)

45:20.323 --> 45:22.573
You're right, Clint, I know you are.

45:28.080 --> 45:31.240
- Okay, I'm gonna start
this thing back up again,

45:31.240 --> 45:33.494
so this time I'm not
gonna give it any gas.

45:33.494 --> 45:37.611
(Carrie and Clint laughing)

45:37.611 --> 45:38.811
Well, look who's here.

45:38.811 --> 45:39.644
(suspenseful music)

45:39.644 --> 45:40.477
- Oh, god.

45:42.199 --> 45:43.032
Becky!

45:44.108 --> 45:45.824
Becky!
- Mom!

45:45.824 --> 45:46.657
- Becky!

45:49.714 --> 45:50.631
Oh, my god.

45:51.750 --> 45:53.861
Are you hurt, are you hurt?

45:53.861 --> 45:55.472
- [Becky] No, but Jayden's dead.

45:55.472 --> 45:57.940
- I know, I know, I know, I know.

45:57.940 --> 45:58.900
I'm so sorry.

45:58.900 --> 46:00.000
Your father called me.

46:02.580 --> 46:05.080
All I can think about
now is that you're okay.

46:05.080 --> 46:07.240
You're alive, you're, you're alive.

46:10.374 --> 46:12.897
(Carrie crying)

46:12.897 --> 46:16.908
- [Becky] Were you gonna drive like this?

46:16.908 --> 46:19.158
Thank god grandpa was here.

46:21.369 --> 46:22.813
Thank you, Grandpa.

46:22.813 --> 46:25.660
- Ah, you don't need to thank me, darling.

46:25.660 --> 46:26.560
You can thank him.

46:35.640 --> 46:38.230
- Nelson, you saved my little girl.

46:38.230 --> 46:41.490
- Carrie, you know I'd
take a bullet for her.

46:41.490 --> 46:42.767
- I do know that.

46:44.150 --> 46:46.310
- Let's get you in the
house, you need to lay down.

46:47.820 --> 46:48.659
- Come on, baby.

46:48.659 --> 46:51.242
(gentle music)

46:54.933 --> 46:57.600
(phone ringing)

46:58.813 --> 46:59.930
- Hey, Sheriff.

46:59.930 --> 47:01.560
- Go ahead, Dave, give me an update.

47:01.560 --> 47:04.390
- Two Texas Rangers and I
secured the crime scene,

47:04.390 --> 47:06.320
and we've got FBI on the way.

47:06.320 --> 47:07.960
- So am I.

47:07.960 --> 47:08.810
How did Becky look?

47:08.810 --> 47:10.400
Did she appear to be injured?

47:10.400 --> 47:12.480
- No, she seemed all right physically,

47:12.480 --> 47:14.860
but uh, she seemed pretty distraught.

47:14.860 --> 47:17.520
I mean suffering to the max.

47:17.520 --> 47:18.660
- She was dating Jayden.

47:18.660 --> 47:20.270
I don't know if you knew that.

47:20.270 --> 47:22.157
- No, I didn't know that till just now,

47:22.157 --> 47:23.920
but that explains a lot.

47:23.920 --> 47:25.230
- I'm heading there as fast as I can.

47:25.230 --> 47:27.550
I left the SAT meeting as soon as I heard.

47:27.550 --> 47:29.100
I'll be there in 30 minutes or less.

47:29.100 --> 47:30.920
Call me if you need me.

47:30.920 --> 47:32.560
- Will do.

47:32.560 --> 47:34.676
- Becky, I need to go join
your dad back at the school,

47:34.676 --> 47:37.280
and you need to go take
care of your mom, all right?

47:37.280 --> 47:38.163
- I know, Nelson.

47:41.420 --> 47:42.920
Look, you saved my life today.

47:45.500 --> 47:48.023
And I am so, so grateful.

47:49.670 --> 47:50.870
I need you to know that.

47:53.180 --> 47:58.180
- Becky, I never had a daughter,
never even had a niece.

48:00.170 --> 48:04.043
You and your family, y'all are it for me.

48:05.872 --> 48:07.532
You can always count on your
Uncle Nelson, all right.

48:07.532 --> 48:08.949
- I know, I know.

48:17.965 --> 48:20.760
- Now you get in there
and check after your mom.

48:20.760 --> 48:21.593
She needs you.

48:23.620 --> 48:27.320
(keys clicking)
(phone ringing)

48:27.320 --> 48:28.270
- Principal.

48:28.270 --> 48:30.270
- Benson.
- Principal Benson,

48:30.270 --> 48:33.440
what we have here is a list
of all the faculty's students

48:33.440 --> 48:35.940
still here being
interviewed by our agents.

48:35.940 --> 48:38.160
What we need is a list of everyone.

48:38.160 --> 48:39.840
Would you be able to do that for us?

48:39.840 --> 48:40.760
- I'll get right on it.

48:40.760 --> 48:41.780
- Thank you.

48:41.780 --> 48:44.450
Principal Benson, I know this is tough.

48:44.450 --> 48:45.664
- I appreciate you.

48:45.664 --> 48:49.080
(phone ringing)

48:49.080 --> 48:51.580
(door clicks)

48:55.710 --> 48:57.173
- Frank Calderone.

49:01.120 --> 49:03.730
How'd you get here so fast from Dallas?

49:03.730 --> 49:05.650
- Good to see you too, Sheriff.

49:05.650 --> 49:08.130
And if you really care by helicopter.

49:08.130 --> 49:10.340
I happened to be in San
Antonio at the regional office

49:10.340 --> 49:12.390
when the call came in.

49:12.390 --> 49:15.540
Two kids shot, officer involved shooting.

49:15.540 --> 49:18.420
Since you're finally here maybe
you can tell me something.

49:18.420 --> 49:19.680
Tell me something about this kid

49:19.680 --> 49:21.483
your deputy shot, Chase Garick.

49:22.860 --> 49:24.360
- I don't know much about him.

49:25.780 --> 49:29.360
Met his dad once, Earl Garick.

49:29.360 --> 49:32.220
He's a long distance truck
driver, he isn't home much.

49:32.220 --> 49:33.633
Never met his mother.

49:34.530 --> 49:37.180
My office has never received
a complaint about Chase.

49:40.310 --> 49:42.070
And what can you tell me about him?

49:42.070 --> 49:44.630
- Well, he's had no criminal history.

49:44.630 --> 49:45.907
Students we interviewed said,

49:45.907 --> 49:48.940
"He's been sullen, disgruntled lately,

49:48.940 --> 49:51.877
seems like he's angry at
something or someone."

49:53.210 --> 49:55.960
- Frank, you wanna take a
look at this before I fax it?

50:03.660 --> 50:04.880
- [Becky] Dad.

50:04.880 --> 50:05.713
- Becky.

50:07.700 --> 50:10.440
Who did Chase Garick talk to?

50:10.440 --> 50:12.380
- [Becky] Gosh, let me think.

50:12.380 --> 50:15.970
Um, well, hardly anyone
because he was so unfriendly.

50:15.970 --> 50:17.670
Always had this snarl on his face.

50:19.000 --> 50:22.900
But there was some student I
remember seeing him talk to,

50:22.900 --> 50:25.753
that was Hunter Denisen.

50:26.790 --> 50:28.070
- Thanks, sweetie.

50:28.070 --> 50:28.903
I gotta go.

50:35.485 --> 50:37.985
(door clicks)

50:39.470 --> 50:40.671
Ed.

50:40.671 --> 50:42.200
(door bangs)

50:42.200 --> 50:43.033
How are you holding up?

50:43.033 --> 50:44.780
- That was a heck of a news conference.

50:44.780 --> 50:45.613
- I know.

50:46.550 --> 50:49.160
Hey, I appreciate everything you do.

50:49.160 --> 50:49.993
- Yeah.

50:49.993 --> 50:54.810
- And listen, you still
have that list of students

50:54.810 --> 50:55.960
that are being detained?

50:55.960 --> 50:57.893
- Yeah, it's in office, Joe.

50:57.893 --> 51:00.040
- All right, let's go look at it.

51:09.260 --> 51:10.913
See if Hunter Denisen is on it.

51:15.900 --> 51:17.673
- Yep, he sure is.

51:20.610 --> 51:21.510
- [Joe] Where they at?

51:21.510 --> 51:23.860
- They're talking to 'em
over in the gymnasium.

51:24.730 --> 51:25.563
- Thanks, Ed.

51:31.897 --> 51:32.730
Hunter.

51:37.501 --> 51:39.340
What did you know about this?

51:39.340 --> 51:40.770
- Nothing.

51:40.770 --> 51:42.430
- Chase didn't say anything to you?

51:42.430 --> 51:43.373
- Not a word.

51:44.350 --> 51:46.630
- He ever complain to you about anyone?

51:46.630 --> 51:48.310
- Well, he complained about everything.

51:48.310 --> 51:49.760
The kid was so paranoid.

51:49.760 --> 51:51.000
He thought everybody had it in for him.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.210
He did the talking not me though.

51:53.210 --> 51:55.190
To be honest I didn't even like the kid.

51:55.190 --> 51:56.490
He just clung to me.

51:56.490 --> 51:57.490
I didn't ask for it.

51:58.920 --> 52:00.770
- You ever mention Chase to your dad?

52:03.160 --> 52:06.040
- Truth is I, I did write about him once

52:06.040 --> 52:07.990
but just talking about how nuts he was.

52:09.310 --> 52:10.170
It's hard to fill up a page

52:10.170 --> 52:12.150
when you're writing your dad in prison.

52:12.150 --> 52:15.750
- What exactly did you
tell your dad about Chase?

52:15.750 --> 52:18.170
- Just about this kid
who's wacko at school,

52:18.170 --> 52:20.360
thinks everyone's badmouthing him.

52:20.360 --> 52:24.647
I was just passing the time,
chewing the cud, that's all.

52:24.647 --> 52:27.720
- (sighs) Has your dad ever asked

52:27.720 --> 52:29.820
about Chase since he's been out of prison?

52:33.700 --> 52:36.043
- Come to think of it yeah, yeah, he did,

52:37.063 --> 52:38.343
but, but just once.

52:41.370 --> 52:42.220
- [Joe] Carry on.

52:46.139 --> 52:47.379
(Hunter sighs)

52:47.379 --> 52:52.379
(brooding music)
(birds chirping)

52:53.344 --> 52:56.177
(car door clicks)

52:57.268 --> 52:58.296
(car door bangs)

52:58.296 --> 52:59.464
- Sheriff.

52:59.464 --> 53:01.900
- Nelson, I wish I had time

53:01.900 --> 53:03.703
to thank you properly but I don't.

53:05.230 --> 53:07.385
What happened when you got Becky home?

53:07.385 --> 53:10.450
- Of the two of 'em I'd be
more considered about Carrie.

53:10.450 --> 53:12.467
- I know, and I need to get home to 'em

53:12.467 --> 53:14.140
but I can't right now.

53:14.140 --> 53:16.520
There's another problem and it's serious.

53:16.520 --> 53:18.490
- What do you mean, Joe?

53:18.490 --> 53:21.400
- What I mean is Draven
Denisen is behind this.

53:21.400 --> 53:23.720
I don't know how he got Chase
Garick to do what he did

53:23.720 --> 53:26.480
but somehow he provoked him.

53:26.480 --> 53:27.980
It's what my gut's telling me.

53:29.000 --> 53:29.833
- What for?

53:30.800 --> 53:31.633
What purpose?

53:32.810 --> 53:35.210
- To attract law enforcement
here like a magnet.

53:36.980 --> 53:40.950
Listen, I'm gonna head
over to First National.

53:40.950 --> 53:42.880
Y'all two get to the Guardian Trust.

53:42.880 --> 53:44.240
They're the only two banks in town,

53:44.240 --> 53:46.060
I suspect he's at one of 'em.

53:46.060 --> 53:47.053
I hope I'm wrong.

53:48.050 --> 53:48.883
- Yeah.
- Let's find out.

53:48.883 --> 53:50.397
- Okay, got it, let's go.

54:00.953 --> 54:02.374
- Son of a!

54:02.374 --> 54:03.473
(gun bangs)

54:03.473 --> 54:05.374
(gun bangs)
(glass shattering)

54:05.374 --> 54:07.266
(gun bangs)

54:07.266 --> 54:09.766
(gun banging)

54:13.025 --> 54:15.313
(truck engine roaring)
(tires screeching)

54:15.313 --> 54:18.313
(suspenseful music)

54:19.801 --> 54:21.111
- [Bedford] Come on, come on!

54:21.111 --> 54:22.027
(woman screaming)

54:22.027 --> 54:23.623
- Change of plans everyone.

54:24.620 --> 54:25.453
End that call.

54:27.327 --> 54:28.802
(woman screams)

54:28.802 --> 54:30.414
- Get up.

54:30.414 --> 54:31.738
Come on, get up against that wall.

54:31.738 --> 54:32.790
- [Buell] Move!

54:32.790 --> 54:35.128
Go!
(woman screaming)

54:35.128 --> 54:35.961
Move it!

54:37.449 --> 54:38.282
Go!

54:40.120 --> 54:40.953
- Come on!

54:42.142 --> 54:42.990
Get over there!

54:42.990 --> 54:43.823
Line up.

54:43.823 --> 54:45.350
Keep your eyes on me.

54:45.350 --> 54:48.700
- Everyone, can I have your attention?

54:48.700 --> 54:50.880
Seems we ran into a
little trouble outside,

54:50.880 --> 54:53.120
so I'm gonna need your Texas hospitality

54:53.120 --> 54:54.913
just a little bit longer.

54:58.218 --> 54:59.140
Is there a back door to this place?

54:59.140 --> 54:59.973
- [Ajani] No.

55:03.240 --> 55:05.393
- What's back there?
- A solid brick wall.

55:10.400 --> 55:11.360
- You watch them.

55:11.360 --> 55:12.383
Buell, get the door.

55:24.259 --> 55:26.532
- You the head honcho around here, right?

55:26.532 --> 55:29.470
- I'm Ajani Sarpong, branch manager.

55:29.470 --> 55:31.210
- How many people work for you?

55:31.210 --> 55:33.030
- Two tellers, one loan officer, and me.

55:33.030 --> 55:34.420
What does it matter?

55:34.420 --> 55:37.900
- You don't ask the
questions here, Johnny.

55:37.900 --> 55:41.560
I ask him and you answer 'em, got it?

55:41.560 --> 55:44.600
- Of course, but you
need to know something,

55:44.600 --> 55:46.900
my only concern are the
lives of these people.

55:47.850 --> 55:50.080
- Now why'd you say that to me?

55:50.080 --> 55:53.470
You got some kind of
threat wrapped up in there?

55:53.470 --> 55:54.590
What are you implying?

55:54.590 --> 55:57.518
- I'm not implying anything,
I'm just stating facts.

55:57.518 --> 56:01.455
- (sighs) Well, let's just put
it to the test then shall we?

56:01.455 --> 56:03.234
(suspenseful music)

56:03.234 --> 56:04.067
Get over there!

56:05.280 --> 56:06.680
You, come here!

56:08.301 --> 56:09.360
Come here.

56:09.360 --> 56:11.610
- Whoa, whoa.
- Get back!

56:11.610 --> 56:14.880
- Whoa, wait, there's security cameras.

56:14.880 --> 56:16.296
Wait!

56:16.296 --> 56:19.500
There is security
cameras, there and there.

56:19.500 --> 56:20.333
They're sending video

56:20.333 --> 56:23.050
to the Texas Department of
Public Safety as we speak.

56:23.050 --> 56:24.730
You want it turned off don't you?

56:24.730 --> 56:25.700
I can do that for you.

56:25.700 --> 56:28.270
There's a control panel in my office.

56:28.270 --> 56:31.830
Your business is with me, not her.

56:31.830 --> 56:34.270
- Yeah, we got business all right,

56:34.270 --> 56:38.793
and when this is over you
and me will settle the score.

56:39.930 --> 56:44.930
But right now I just need
you to shut the fuck up

56:45.480 --> 56:46.870
and take me to that-

56:46.870 --> 56:47.999
- Take me.

56:47.999 --> 56:51.528
(suspenseful music)

56:51.528 --> 56:53.070
Let's go.

56:53.070 --> 56:54.310
Watch these guys.

56:56.827 --> 56:58.293
(brooding music)

56:58.293 --> 57:01.539
(police radio chattering)

57:01.539 --> 57:04.206
(ominous music)

57:05.070 --> 57:09.870
- [Dispatcher] Come in 98,
got 6418 South Avenue 67.

57:09.870 --> 57:11.270
(police radio chattering)

57:11.270 --> 57:14.102
- [Dispatcher 2] Respond to
transport your suspect please.

57:14.102 --> 57:17.602
(police radio chattering)

57:19.997 --> 57:23.497
(police radio chattering)

57:25.930 --> 57:28.600
- [Dispatcher] 71 stand by.

57:28.600 --> 57:30.090
- Let me ask you something, Sheriff,

57:30.090 --> 57:32.480
the business beside the bank,

57:32.480 --> 57:34.360
I haven't seen anybody go in or come out.

57:34.360 --> 57:37.693
- It's because there is no
business there, it went under.

57:39.077 --> 57:41.977
And what I'd like to know is
what are you gonna do, Frank?

57:43.680 --> 57:46.030
- I've got Draven's son, Hunter.

57:46.030 --> 57:47.840
We're gonna let him talk to his dad.

57:49.468 --> 57:51.918
- What do you expect to
accomplish by doing that?

57:52.980 --> 57:55.350
- I'm gonna send him message.

57:55.350 --> 57:58.480
He's got people in there,
I've got somebody out here.

57:58.480 --> 58:00.070
- He's never gonna fall for that.

58:00.070 --> 58:02.170
He knows you can't do anything to his son.

58:02.170 --> 58:03.750
You've got nothing on him.

58:03.750 --> 58:06.160
There's no evidence that
he was criminally involved.

58:06.160 --> 58:07.810
You're just gonna agitate Draven.

58:09.870 --> 58:12.263
Take my advice don't do it.

58:13.630 --> 58:16.110
- I'll take that under advisement

58:16.110 --> 58:17.460
but it's already in motion.

58:20.899 --> 58:21.899
Get him out.

58:24.380 --> 58:27.213
(car door clicks)

58:51.407 --> 58:52.913
- Hey, Dad.

58:53.953 --> 58:56.113
It's, it's me, Hunter.

58:57.620 --> 59:01.393
Uh, I don't know what's going on.

59:03.071 --> 59:05.677
I don't understand what
happened at school,

59:06.924 --> 59:11.217
but uh, if you want me to
come in there I, I will.

59:14.060 --> 59:17.843
I don't mind, really I, I don't.

59:18.720 --> 59:22.543
Um, it's not a problem for me.

59:24.340 --> 59:25.173
It really isn't.

59:28.143 --> 59:31.726
So just let me know
what you want me to do.

59:37.187 --> 59:40.687
(police radio chattering)

59:44.694 --> 59:48.194
(police radio chattering)

59:50.129 --> 59:54.423
(police radio chattering)

59:54.423 --> 59:57.923
(police radio chattering)

1:00:01.401 --> 1:00:04.901
(police radio chattering)

1:00:14.624 --> 1:00:16.057
- Me?

1:00:16.057 --> 1:00:17.724
- [Draven] Let's go.

1:00:19.362 --> 1:00:23.195
- [Carlos] Are you gonna
shoot me in the back?

1:00:25.023 --> 1:00:26.810
- It's your lucky day, poncho,

1:00:28.250 --> 1:00:30.070
you're being released.

1:00:30.070 --> 1:00:32.120
You just gotta make a run for the border.

1:00:33.440 --> 1:00:34.456
- Are you gonna shoot me in the back?

1:00:34.456 --> 1:00:36.590
(Draven laughs)

1:00:36.590 --> 1:00:38.487
- Not if you can dodge bullets.

1:00:38.487 --> 1:00:40.216
(suspenseful music)

1:00:40.216 --> 1:00:41.492
- Get down, get down.

1:00:41.492 --> 1:00:43.575
Here you go, here you go.

1:00:48.254 --> 1:00:51.004
(paper rustling)

1:00:57.340 --> 1:01:00.790
- Clear the streets, have
a military helicopter land

1:01:00.790 --> 1:01:05.760
with a full tank of fuel,
stocked with food and water.

1:01:05.760 --> 1:01:09.660
The pilot won't be hurt
so long as he cooperates.

1:01:09.660 --> 1:01:11.610
You have till midnight.

1:01:11.610 --> 1:01:15.490
If it isn't here by then
I will shoot a hostage.

1:01:15.490 --> 1:01:19.033
Then I'll shoot one each
hour until it gets here.

1:01:22.890 --> 1:01:25.190
What does he expect to
do with the helicopter?

1:01:26.650 --> 1:01:28.890
- He used to fly helicopters.

1:01:28.890 --> 1:01:30.163
- When, was he military?

1:01:31.060 --> 1:01:33.690
- Nah, when he was younger

1:01:33.690 --> 1:01:37.290
he flew crop dusters, the helicopter kind.

1:01:37.290 --> 1:01:40.750
- Hell, if he could do that
why did he turn to crime?

1:01:40.750 --> 1:01:43.720
- He did it drunk once
almost killed himself,

1:01:43.720 --> 1:01:45.370
two people on the ground.

1:01:45.370 --> 1:01:47.170
Needless to say he lost his license.

1:01:50.760 --> 1:01:51.810
- Where would he fly?

1:01:54.080 --> 1:01:56.060
- I can only speculate.

1:01:56.060 --> 1:01:57.883
We both know how useless that is.

1:02:00.340 --> 1:02:03.643
- He's given us till
midnight, so it'll turn dark,

1:02:04.950 --> 1:02:05.953
he has a plan.

1:02:08.210 --> 1:02:09.760
- What are you gonna do, Frank?

1:02:11.690 --> 1:02:13.873
- It's not up to me, not my decision.

1:02:14.899 --> 1:02:16.793
FBI doesn't operate like that.

1:02:19.460 --> 1:02:20.550
What's your name?

1:02:20.550 --> 1:02:21.750
- Carlos.

1:02:21.750 --> 1:02:23.090
- Carlos, are you hurt?

1:02:23.090 --> 1:02:23.923
- No, sir.

1:02:23.923 --> 1:02:25.970
- Is anyone inside the bank hurt?

1:02:25.970 --> 1:02:27.320
- Not that I know of.

1:02:27.320 --> 1:02:28.730
- Three gunmen?

1:02:28.730 --> 1:02:31.670
- [Carlos] Yes, sir, seven
hostages are still remaining.

1:02:31.670 --> 1:02:35.900
- Okay, okay, Carlos, we're
gonna need your full statement.

1:02:35.900 --> 1:02:37.563
- Yes.
- Thank you.

1:02:46.170 --> 1:02:47.003
- Oh, Johnny.

1:02:48.790 --> 1:02:51.190
You spread on down there a little bit.

1:02:51.190 --> 1:02:53.090
What are you all huddled up there for?

1:02:54.453 --> 1:02:55.286
Plottin'?

1:02:57.530 --> 1:02:58.363
Shh.

1:03:03.130 --> 1:03:05.553
Quit crying, I'm sick of it.

1:03:05.553 --> 1:03:07.310
(Hostage crying)

1:03:07.310 --> 1:03:09.141
- [Nurse] Are you okay?

1:03:09.141 --> 1:03:09.974
- No.

1:03:11.590 --> 1:03:12.423
Not really.

1:03:12.423 --> 1:03:15.923
I, my bladder is acting up.

1:03:16.770 --> 1:03:19.830
- Oh, tell me about it, I'm a nurse.

1:03:19.830 --> 1:03:21.013
- Really?
- Yeah.

1:03:23.153 --> 1:03:26.249
- I have this condition it's called IC.

1:03:26.249 --> 1:03:27.082
- Oh, god.

1:03:28.339 --> 1:03:32.500
- Yeah, and I really have to go.

1:03:32.500 --> 1:03:33.550
- Ouch.

1:03:33.550 --> 1:03:34.973
Yeah, that's gotta hurt.

1:03:36.330 --> 1:03:38.018
Why don't you tell him you have to go?

1:03:38.018 --> 1:03:39.570
- What?
- Tell him.

1:03:39.570 --> 1:03:40.403
- No.

1:03:40.403 --> 1:03:44.150
Did you see the way that he
acted last time I asked him?

1:03:44.150 --> 1:03:45.733
And it wasn't that long ago.

1:03:46.950 --> 1:03:48.853
That guy really scares me.

1:03:50.130 --> 1:03:51.676
- Okay, stand up.

1:03:51.676 --> 1:03:52.610
- What?

1:03:52.610 --> 1:03:53.700
- Come on.
- No.

1:03:53.700 --> 1:03:54.533
- Yes.
- No, no, no.

1:03:54.533 --> 1:03:56.230
- You can, you can do it.
- No.

1:03:56.230 --> 1:03:57.890
- Yes.

1:03:57.890 --> 1:03:58.940
Good girl, good girl.

1:04:04.670 --> 1:04:08.180
Hey, she need to use the ladies' room now,

1:04:08.180 --> 1:04:09.970
it's a medical necessity.

1:04:09.970 --> 1:04:12.293
- It is for all of us, toots.

1:04:13.190 --> 1:04:14.900
She can just wait her turn.

1:04:14.900 --> 1:04:16.790
- Think again, Clyde,

1:04:16.790 --> 1:04:20.260
she's got a condition called
interstitial cystitis.

1:04:20.260 --> 1:04:22.673
It's very painful, she's gotta go now.

1:04:24.801 --> 1:04:27.090
- Well, maybe she can just hold it.

1:04:27.090 --> 1:04:29.628
Somebody else is going right now.

1:04:29.628 --> 1:04:34.540
- No, you don't understand, I
can't hold it anymore, okay.

1:04:34.540 --> 1:04:35.373
Please.
- Boo.

1:04:35.373 --> 1:04:36.206
- Just-
- It don't make-

1:04:36.206 --> 1:04:38.367
- Please.
- No nevermind to me, darlin'.

1:04:38.367 --> 1:04:39.870
- Excuse me.

1:04:39.870 --> 1:04:41.410
There's a private lavatory in my office,

1:04:41.410 --> 1:04:42.610
she's welcome to use it.

1:04:43.810 --> 1:04:48.400
- [Bedford] What she's
welcome to use or not use

1:04:48.400 --> 1:04:50.360
is not for you to say.

1:04:50.360 --> 1:04:51.410
- She's suffering.
- Johnny.

1:04:51.410 --> 1:04:52.750
- She's suffering.

1:04:52.750 --> 1:04:54.440
I'm appealing to your decency.

1:04:54.440 --> 1:04:56.630
- My decency.
- Your humanity.

1:04:56.630 --> 1:04:57.630
- [Bedford] You're trying
to butter me up, boy.

1:04:57.630 --> 1:05:00.080
- No, I'm not, I'm just saying.

1:05:00.080 --> 1:05:02.594
(fist thuds)
(Bedford groans)

1:05:02.594 --> 1:05:05.081
(elbow thudding)

1:05:05.081 --> 1:05:07.998
(Bedford groaning)

1:05:09.040 --> 1:05:10.458
(Bedford yelling)
(Ajani groans)

1:05:10.458 --> 1:05:12.875
(body thuds)

1:05:14.947 --> 1:05:17.685
(Bedford groans)
(body thuds)

1:05:17.685 --> 1:05:18.600
(gun clicks)

1:05:18.600 --> 1:05:19.863
Drop it, drop it!

1:05:21.207 --> 1:05:22.388
(woman gasping)

1:05:22.388 --> 1:05:23.221
(woman screaming)

1:05:23.221 --> 1:05:24.054
(fist thuds)
(Draven yells)

1:05:24.054 --> 1:05:26.471
(body thuds)

1:05:30.704 --> 1:05:35.010
- I think you killed
him, and I hope you did.

1:05:35.010 --> 1:05:37.517
- [Draven] No, he's gonna come around,

1:05:37.517 --> 1:05:39.350
and you better get these on him

1:05:39.350 --> 1:05:42.287
before he does and he hoodwinks you again.

1:05:42.287 --> 1:05:45.473
(suspenseful music)

1:05:45.473 --> 1:05:48.223
(Ajani groaning)

1:05:58.074 --> 1:06:00.824
(brooding music)

1:06:03.621 --> 1:06:05.586
(door clicks)
(suspenseful music)

1:06:05.586 --> 1:06:08.003
(door thuds)

1:06:16.926 --> 1:06:17.830
- [Laura] Hunter.

1:06:17.830 --> 1:06:18.889
That's my son.
- Mam.

1:06:18.889 --> 1:06:20.197
- You cannot go through.
- You cannot go in there, mam.

1:06:20.197 --> 1:06:21.405
- That's my son.
- You cannot go through.

1:06:21.405 --> 1:06:22.846
- I wanna see my son-
- I understand, I understand.

1:06:22.846 --> 1:06:23.679
- That is my son-
- I need you to stay here.

1:06:23.679 --> 1:06:25.300
- And I have a right to see him.

1:06:25.300 --> 1:06:26.972
- Vince, let her through.
- All right, all right,

1:06:26.972 --> 1:06:29.055
come on, let her through.

1:06:32.153 --> 1:06:34.160
- Joe, I wanna leave with Hunter now.

1:06:34.160 --> 1:06:36.030
- No, Mom, I'm staying.

1:06:36.030 --> 1:06:37.640
I might be able to help.

1:06:37.640 --> 1:06:38.473
I'm his son.

1:06:39.578 --> 1:06:42.300
Whether you like it or not, I'm his son.

1:06:42.300 --> 1:06:45.890
- Hunter, in the car now.

1:06:45.890 --> 1:06:46.723
- No.

1:06:46.723 --> 1:06:47.750
- Listen to your mother.

1:06:47.750 --> 1:06:48.583
- Joe.

1:06:49.780 --> 1:06:50.780
Get him out of here.

1:06:54.860 --> 1:06:55.693
- After you.

1:06:56.661 --> 1:06:59.411
(brooding music)

1:07:09.383 --> 1:07:11.840
(car door clicks)

1:07:11.840 --> 1:07:12.893
- Thank you, Joe.

1:07:13.770 --> 1:07:15.630
I was so scared he might end up.

1:07:15.630 --> 1:07:17.183
- It's okay, Laura.

1:07:18.310 --> 1:07:20.260
We'll talk about it when it's all over.

1:07:22.380 --> 1:07:23.763
- Took a job in Austin.

1:07:24.720 --> 1:07:26.320
Hunter and I need a fresh start.

1:07:32.390 --> 1:07:35.607
- [Joe] Laura, I think
that's a great idea.

1:07:36.990 --> 1:07:38.724
Call me if you need me.

1:07:38.724 --> 1:07:39.557
- You bet.

1:07:47.371 --> 1:07:50.660
(car door clicks)

1:07:50.660 --> 1:07:52.680
- [Joe] You be good to your mother.

1:07:52.680 --> 1:07:54.450
Fresh starts don't come along every day,

1:07:54.450 --> 1:07:56.073
I want you to think about that.

1:07:58.120 --> 1:08:00.583
Hunter, you hear me?

1:08:02.600 --> 1:08:03.433
- Yeah.

1:08:05.705 --> 1:08:07.631
(car engine revving)

1:08:07.631 --> 1:08:11.198
(car door bangs)

1:08:11.198 --> 1:08:13.948
(brooding music)

1:08:17.580 --> 1:08:20.210
- Joe, you oughta go ahead and go home.

1:08:20.210 --> 1:08:23.559
We're at a standstill, ain't
nothing gonna happen right now,

1:08:23.559 --> 1:08:24.782
at least till midnight.

1:08:28.600 --> 1:08:31.710
- All right, I'll be
back in a couple hours.

1:08:31.710 --> 1:08:33.410
- I should know something by then.

1:08:43.461 --> 1:08:46.944
(door creaking)

1:08:46.944 --> 1:08:50.246
(door clicks)

1:08:50.246 --> 1:08:52.830
(gentle music)

1:08:55.539 --> 1:08:57.206
- [Joe] How are you?

1:08:58.139 --> 1:08:59.032
- I'm a wreck.

1:09:00.960 --> 1:09:02.513
But not as bad as last time.

1:09:04.127 --> 1:09:05.294
- That's good.

1:09:11.880 --> 1:09:13.520
How's Becky?

1:09:13.520 --> 1:09:16.243
- She's suffering hard over Jayden.

1:09:21.510 --> 1:09:22.760
- Has she eaten anything?

1:09:24.744 --> 1:09:27.390
- No.

1:09:27.390 --> 1:09:29.219
- You know if she ate this morning?

1:09:29.219 --> 1:09:30.452
- I don't think she did.

1:09:32.639 --> 1:09:34.590
- So she hasn't eaten anything all day.

1:09:35.610 --> 1:09:37.117
- [Carrie] I don't think she has.

1:09:42.496 --> 1:09:43.899
- I'm gonna go talk to her

1:09:43.899 --> 1:09:48.395
and after that let's all
sit down together and eat,

1:09:48.395 --> 1:09:49.228
the three of us.

1:09:51.870 --> 1:09:55.040
May be the only way we can
get her to eat something.

1:09:55.040 --> 1:09:56.373
- Okay, I agree.

1:09:58.011 --> 1:09:59.594
I'll start cooking.

1:10:11.360 --> 1:10:12.748
(Becky crying)

1:10:12.748 --> 1:10:14.253
(knuckles tapping)

1:10:14.253 --> 1:10:15.585
- Becky.
- Daddy.

1:10:23.404 --> 1:10:25.487
Dad, how did this happen?

1:10:27.021 --> 1:10:30.156
(gentle pensive music)

1:10:30.156 --> 1:10:32.362
- (sighs) A very bad man did this,

1:10:35.010 --> 1:10:36.770
and I mean someone other than Chase.

1:10:36.770 --> 1:10:38.458
He manipulated Chase.

1:10:38.458 --> 1:10:39.291
- How?

1:10:42.750 --> 1:10:44.353
- I haven't figured that out yet.

1:10:46.486 --> 1:10:49.236
- Why would anyone wanna do that?

1:10:51.227 --> 1:10:54.370
- There are some very
bad people in this world

1:10:54.370 --> 1:10:58.873
with no limits, that's the terrible truth.

1:11:04.809 --> 1:11:07.142
- Dad, I'm sick over Jayden.

1:11:10.889 --> 1:11:12.763
- I know, Becky, we all are.

1:11:13.730 --> 1:11:15.013
He was a fine young man,

1:11:16.090 --> 1:11:21.090
which reminds me I need
to go visit his parents.

1:11:23.100 --> 1:11:24.100
- Can I go with you?

1:11:28.525 --> 1:11:32.362
- Well, I'm going not just
as a friend but as Sheriff,

1:11:36.630 --> 1:11:39.952
but okay, you can come.

1:11:43.413 --> 1:11:46.996
- You know Dad, I really
think I loved him.

1:11:53.016 --> 1:11:55.933
We, we never said it to each other.

1:11:58.541 --> 1:12:00.492
I mean it just hadn't come to that yet.

1:12:03.205 --> 1:12:05.371
And I'm sick about it now.

1:12:08.721 --> 1:12:10.809
We never made love,

1:12:10.809 --> 1:12:13.559
it hadn't come to that here yet.

1:12:18.261 --> 1:12:20.202
But I wish I would of said the words.

1:12:22.710 --> 1:12:25.093
I feel so guilty about it now.

1:12:25.930 --> 1:12:29.223
- Becky, you have nothing
to feel guilty about.

1:12:31.600 --> 1:12:35.043
I respect you both for
waiting, for taking it slow.

1:12:38.592 --> 1:12:40.143
You're still in high school.

1:12:43.027 --> 1:12:46.610
- You and Mom were high
school sweethearts,

1:12:50.309 --> 1:12:51.910
were you crazy about each other?

1:12:54.990 --> 1:12:57.023
- Oh, I guess that's the way it was.

1:12:58.427 --> 1:13:00.277
But that doesn't make it commendable.

1:13:02.860 --> 1:13:04.353
It's a bumpy road, Becky.

1:13:06.110 --> 1:13:09.243
- I'd like tell his parents
how good he was to me.

1:13:10.517 --> 1:13:14.263
- Well, I'm sure you'll
be able to and soon.

1:13:15.402 --> 1:13:18.469
Now Becky, I think we should
get some food into you.

1:13:18.469 --> 1:13:19.940
You haven't eaten anything all day.

1:13:19.940 --> 1:13:23.293
- No, Dad, I can't, I,
I don't feel like it.

1:13:23.293 --> 1:13:25.320
I, I don't have any appetite.

1:13:25.320 --> 1:13:26.452
Please don't make me.

1:13:29.331 --> 1:13:32.663
- Well, okay, you're
excused from dinner tonight.

1:13:33.750 --> 1:13:35.010
But you have to eat something tomorrow,

1:13:35.010 --> 1:13:36.923
young lady, you understand?

1:13:38.469 --> 1:13:39.302
- I do.

1:13:40.258 --> 1:13:41.770
I promise I will.

1:13:41.770 --> 1:13:44.362
- Well, if you're not gonna eat,

1:13:46.760 --> 1:13:48.873
I think you should go right to sleep.

1:13:51.445 --> 1:13:52.278
- Okay.

1:14:10.300 --> 1:14:11.800
I love you, Daddy.

1:14:15.893 --> 1:14:17.996
- Your daddy loves you too, Becky.

1:14:19.984 --> 1:14:23.850
(light switch clicks)

1:14:23.850 --> 1:14:26.350
(door clicks)

1:14:35.414 --> 1:14:36.246
(brooding music)

1:14:36.246 --> 1:14:37.080
- Tom called.

1:14:38.671 --> 1:14:39.821
- Did he talk to Becky?

1:14:41.690 --> 1:14:42.523
- Yes, he did.

1:14:44.150 --> 1:14:45.400
He'd like to talk to you.

1:14:48.180 --> 1:14:49.530
- I'll call him when I can.

1:14:51.822 --> 1:14:53.272
- What are you gonna do, Joe?

1:14:56.039 --> 1:14:59.243
(scoffs) You're gonna go back
there tonight aren't you?

1:15:01.180 --> 1:15:02.520
- Yes, of course.

1:15:05.607 --> 1:15:06.553
- But why?

1:15:08.380 --> 1:15:10.800
The FBI are there and the Texas Rangers,

1:15:10.800 --> 1:15:12.770
what do they need you for?

1:15:12.770 --> 1:15:14.123
- Because I'm the sheriff,

1:15:17.559 --> 1:15:18.943
and I need to be there.

1:15:20.639 --> 1:15:22.280
- [Carrie] Okay, I'm not
gonna fight with you, Joe,

1:15:22.280 --> 1:15:24.430
not this time, not like last time.

1:15:24.430 --> 1:15:26.213
- There's nothing to fight about, Carrie.

1:15:27.430 --> 1:15:28.937
Besides as you said,

1:15:28.937 --> 1:15:31.650
"The FBI and the Texas Rangers are there,"

1:15:31.650 --> 1:15:33.550
and this time I'm not
gonna be chasing somebody

1:15:33.550 --> 1:15:34.583
off into the woods.

1:15:36.030 --> 1:15:39.940
Believe me, Carrie, if
I could just stay here

1:15:39.940 --> 1:15:42.463
with you tonight I would, I gladly would.

1:15:46.210 --> 1:15:50.150
- It would just be so nice
after everything that happened

1:15:51.650 --> 1:15:54.467
to put this godawful day
and ourselves to bed.

1:15:56.300 --> 1:15:58.300
Do you know what I mean?

1:16:23.383 --> 1:16:24.633
- I do, Carrie.

1:16:25.760 --> 1:16:28.010
It would be nice, awfully nice.

1:16:30.947 --> 1:16:31.780
(gentle music)

1:16:31.780 --> 1:16:35.443
I'm coming home to you
tonight and that's a promise.

1:16:41.272 --> 1:16:43.273
I'll always come home to you.

1:17:13.261 --> 1:17:17.403
(gun clicks)
(brooding music)

1:17:17.403 --> 1:17:18.862
Whataya found out, Frank?

1:17:24.139 --> 1:17:25.240
- Decision's been made,

1:17:25.240 --> 1:17:27.139
we're not gonna give him a helicopter.

1:17:28.330 --> 1:17:29.623
We're gonna use gas.

1:17:31.166 --> 1:17:33.362
- (scoffs) Gas again?

1:17:34.550 --> 1:17:36.370
Did you not learn anything from Waco?

1:17:36.370 --> 1:17:37.993
- It's less flammable.

1:17:37.993 --> 1:17:39.010
(Joe scoffs)

1:17:39.010 --> 1:17:40.400
- Less flammable?

1:17:40.400 --> 1:17:42.740
It's still flammable, Frank.

1:17:42.740 --> 1:17:46.230
- Joe, I know you're used to
calling the shots around here

1:17:47.489 --> 1:17:50.110
but this is way above your pay grade.

1:17:50.110 --> 1:17:51.250
This action was approved

1:17:51.250 --> 1:17:53.950
by the Attorney General
of the United States.

1:17:53.950 --> 1:17:55.770
- So was the action at Waco.

1:17:55.770 --> 1:17:57.820
- We can't give his bastard a helicopter.

1:18:00.309 --> 1:18:02.620
- You're gonna risk
incinerating all those people

1:18:02.620 --> 1:18:04.670
because you can't think of anything else?

1:18:06.059 --> 1:18:08.570
- There's a chain of command here.

1:18:08.570 --> 1:18:12.330
The FBI's a quasi-military organization,

1:18:12.330 --> 1:18:13.700
I'm not in charge.

1:18:13.700 --> 1:18:15.853
You're sure the hell not in charge.

1:18:17.180 --> 1:18:21.830
And Arlettsville it ain't
like Mayberry anymore.

1:18:27.490 --> 1:18:29.940
- [Joe] Ain't been like
Mayberry for a long time.

1:18:31.587 --> 1:18:34.147
(phone ringing)

1:18:34.147 --> 1:18:36.940
(phone clicks)

1:18:36.940 --> 1:18:37.773
- Wayne Beatty.

1:18:38.630 --> 1:18:40.550
- [Joe] Wayne, this is Sheriff Joe.

1:18:40.550 --> 1:18:43.580
I need to speak to you in
confidence, it's important.

1:18:43.580 --> 1:18:45.330
- Go ahead, Sheriff, I'm listening.

1:18:46.219 --> 1:18:48.400
- [Joe] Well, first are you alone?

1:18:48.400 --> 1:18:49.233
- I am.

1:18:50.300 --> 1:18:51.900
- [Joe] Is this a recorded line?

1:18:53.389 --> 1:18:54.740
- Probably, I can't say for certain

1:18:54.740 --> 1:18:56.463
but more than likely it is.

1:18:57.602 --> 1:19:00.160
- [Joe] Do you have your cellphone on you?

1:19:00.160 --> 1:19:01.020
- I do.

1:19:01.020 --> 1:19:02.490
- [Joe] All right, then
I'll call you back on it.

1:19:02.490 --> 1:19:03.389
What's the number?

1:19:04.719 --> 1:19:08.740
- 512-297-0408.

1:19:08.740 --> 1:19:10.740
- [Joe] Okay, I'm calling you right now.

1:19:12.746 --> 1:19:15.330
(phone clicks)

1:19:17.294 --> 1:19:19.960
(phone ringing)

1:19:23.090 --> 1:19:24.090
- Go ahead, Sheriff.

1:19:27.160 --> 1:19:27.993
I do.

1:19:32.240 --> 1:19:33.559
Well, I could.

1:19:33.559 --> 1:19:36.360
I mean I have the capacity
if that's what you're asking.

1:19:40.610 --> 1:19:41.803
Wait, is Harriet?

1:19:45.440 --> 1:19:46.790
Okay, now I know you would.

1:19:50.050 --> 1:19:51.023
I don't doubt that.

1:19:56.160 --> 1:19:57.340
Well, I've never done it before

1:19:57.340 --> 1:19:58.900
and no one else has either that I know of,

1:19:58.900 --> 1:20:00.153
so I'd just be guessing.

1:20:07.950 --> 1:20:11.480
Well, if that's what you need,
Sheriff, I'm gonna do it.

1:20:11.480 --> 1:20:13.733
Come hell or high water I'm gonna do it,

1:20:14.710 --> 1:20:15.623
just tell me when.

1:20:17.267 --> 1:20:19.734
(insects chirping)

1:20:19.734 --> 1:20:22.484
(brooding music)

1:20:31.992 --> 1:20:33.910
(truck door clicks)

1:20:33.910 --> 1:20:34.827
- Hey, Joe.

1:20:37.249 --> 1:20:39.960
All right, let's do this.

1:20:42.150 --> 1:20:44.110
- How are the kids, Dave?

1:20:44.110 --> 1:20:45.540
- Kids are good.

1:20:45.540 --> 1:20:46.389
Everybody's well.

1:20:48.730 --> 1:20:50.473
- Angela's sure growing up fast.

1:20:51.920 --> 1:20:53.920
- Yeah, she's in fourth grade this year.

1:20:55.550 --> 1:20:57.600
- Little Benny, his birthday's coming up.

1:20:58.760 --> 1:21:02.183
- Yeah, he'll be uh, three in October.

1:21:03.700 --> 1:21:05.150
Something bothering you, Joe?

1:21:08.355 --> 1:21:10.055
- Go on back to your family, Dave.

1:21:11.100 --> 1:21:12.110
- What?

1:21:12.110 --> 1:21:13.990
We have a situation tonight.

1:21:13.990 --> 1:21:16.950
- Not you, buddy, not tonight.

1:21:16.950 --> 1:21:18.480
- What are you talking about?

1:21:18.480 --> 1:21:21.683
I'm your top deputy, why
are you excluding me?

1:21:22.910 --> 1:21:25.193
- I will no subject your
family to that risk.

1:21:26.809 --> 1:21:27.780
- I'll be wearing a vest, Joe.

1:21:27.780 --> 1:21:29.117
- It doesn't cover everything,

1:21:29.117 --> 1:21:31.660
and it sure as hell doesn't
come with a guarantee.

1:21:31.660 --> 1:21:32.559
- And what about Nelson?

1:21:32.559 --> 1:21:33.844
- He doesn't have a family.

1:21:33.844 --> 1:21:35.420
- What about you?

1:21:35.420 --> 1:21:36.693
- My kids are older.

1:21:38.280 --> 1:21:42.210
- Is this a reason or
is this a justification?

1:21:42.210 --> 1:21:44.860
- You can think whatever you want, Dave,

1:21:44.860 --> 1:21:46.660
I don't have time to argue with you.

1:21:48.510 --> 1:21:51.653
Gonna say this one time,
get out of this truck,

1:21:52.590 --> 1:21:54.570
and go back to your family.

1:21:54.570 --> 1:21:55.573
It's not a request.

1:21:58.809 --> 1:21:59.643
- Is that what you want, Joe?

1:21:59.643 --> 1:22:00.476
- It is.

1:22:03.809 --> 1:22:04.643
- Okay.

1:22:08.320 --> 1:22:09.742
Godspeed to you and Nelson tonight.

1:22:09.742 --> 1:22:11.340
(hand tapping)

1:22:11.340 --> 1:22:12.197
Go get 'em.

1:22:16.312 --> 1:22:19.477
(truck door bangs)

1:22:19.477 --> 1:22:22.727
(truck engine revving)

1:22:29.125 --> 1:22:32.041
(insects chirping)

1:22:34.657 --> 1:22:35.639
(gun clicking)

1:22:35.639 --> 1:22:37.675
(phone ringing)

1:22:37.675 --> 1:22:38.675
- Hey, babe.

1:22:40.709 --> 1:22:42.280
(sighs) I didn't tell you yet,

1:22:42.280 --> 1:22:43.743
Joe and I have to work tonight.

1:22:43.743 --> 1:22:44.670
(knuckles tapping)

1:22:44.670 --> 1:22:45.940
Yeah.

1:22:45.940 --> 1:22:47.913
Hold on second, Chels, Joe's at the door.

1:22:51.255 --> 1:22:52.705
Hey, come right in.

1:22:52.705 --> 1:22:53.538
- Nelson.

1:22:54.789 --> 1:22:56.089
(door bangs)

1:22:56.089 --> 1:22:57.922
- Hey, I'm back, baby.

1:22:59.469 --> 1:23:00.580
Well, it's related to it,

1:23:00.580 --> 1:23:01.657
but you know they got the FBI,

1:23:01.657 --> 1:23:03.940
and the Texas Rangers out there,

1:23:03.940 --> 1:23:05.490
so we're just the local yokels.

1:23:08.500 --> 1:23:09.860
I know you do.

1:23:09.860 --> 1:23:11.010
I'm a lucky man for it.

1:23:15.260 --> 1:23:16.240
I can give you a call, baby,

1:23:16.240 --> 1:23:17.480
but it's probably gonna be really late.

1:23:17.480 --> 1:23:18.780
I don't wanna wake you up.

1:23:22.750 --> 1:23:26.830
I know you are, everybody
is, but worrying don't help.

1:23:26.830 --> 1:23:28.780
You need to get a good night's sleep.

1:23:28.780 --> 1:23:31.050
That's all you need to
think about right now.

1:23:31.050 --> 1:23:32.903
I'll call you first thing in the morning.

1:23:33.960 --> 1:23:34.963
I will.

1:23:36.110 --> 1:23:40.093
Hey, Chels, I love you.

1:23:40.980 --> 1:23:42.080
You rest easy on that.

1:23:45.690 --> 1:23:46.523
I mean it too.

1:23:48.191 --> 1:23:49.023
All right.

1:23:50.279 --> 1:23:51.612
Good, goodnight.

1:23:52.630 --> 1:23:55.380
(brooding music)

1:24:05.749 --> 1:24:09.618
(door knocker tapping)

1:24:09.618 --> 1:24:12.035
(gun clicks)

1:24:13.172 --> 1:24:15.672
(door clicks)

1:24:19.688 --> 1:24:21.013
(door clicks)

1:24:21.013 --> 1:24:23.680
(door creaking)

1:24:27.025 --> 1:24:28.070
(door bangs)

1:24:28.070 --> 1:24:29.920
- Where the hell do
you think you're going?

1:24:29.920 --> 1:24:31.509
- Same place you're going.

1:24:31.509 --> 1:24:32.840
- [Joe] Uh-uh.

1:24:32.840 --> 1:24:35.389
- You need three people
for this and that's a fact.

1:24:37.105 --> 1:24:39.600
- [Joe] How do you know Dave isn't coming?

1:24:39.600 --> 1:24:40.433
- Is he?

1:24:42.969 --> 1:24:46.680
- Pop, I cannot let you
do this, it's too risky.

1:24:46.680 --> 1:24:51.680
- Son, I've done everything
I wanna do in this life,

1:24:54.200 --> 1:24:55.702
I have seen everything I wanna seen,

1:24:55.702 --> 1:24:57.543
I don't have a bucket list,

1:25:00.090 --> 1:25:04.860
but if I die during this well,
I've made peace with that

1:25:07.349 --> 1:25:09.249
'cause I get to see your mother again.

1:25:12.840 --> 1:25:14.943
So if it's not too risky for you,

1:25:16.250 --> 1:25:18.303
and it's not too risky for Nelson,

1:25:20.950 --> 1:25:23.503
well, it sure as hell
ain't too risky for me.

1:25:25.222 --> 1:25:26.327
- Well, I don't have time to stand here

1:25:26.327 --> 1:25:27.977
and and argue with you all night.

1:25:28.840 --> 1:25:30.688
I'll have to deputize you.

1:25:30.688 --> 1:25:31.779
(hand taps)

1:25:31.779 --> 1:25:32.823
- I'd be honored.

1:25:33.727 --> 1:25:34.559
- [Dispatcher] All units stand by.

1:25:34.559 --> 1:25:35.705
(electricity clicks)

1:25:35.705 --> 1:25:36.814
(suspenseful music)

1:25:36.814 --> 1:25:38.023
- What the hell happened?

1:25:38.023 --> 1:25:40.050
- I don't know, maybe a transformer blew

1:25:40.050 --> 1:25:42.260
but I didn't hear anything.

1:25:42.260 --> 1:25:44.370
- Do you have an emergency
backup generator?

1:25:44.370 --> 1:25:46.362
- We do but not with us.

1:25:47.236 --> 1:25:48.400
- How long will it take to get here?

1:25:48.400 --> 1:25:49.550
- It's not gonna be quick.

1:25:49.550 --> 1:25:50.900
At least a couple of hours.

1:25:54.040 --> 1:25:55.753
- Where the hell is the Sheriff?

1:26:19.340 --> 1:26:20.303
- What happened?

1:26:21.420 --> 1:26:25.030
- [Buell] They turned off the
power and he's uh, coming in.

1:26:25.030 --> 1:26:30.030
- No, not they, he, he
turned off the power.

1:26:33.059 --> 1:26:34.683
Sheriff.

1:26:34.683 --> 1:26:37.502
(suspenseful music)

1:26:37.502 --> 1:26:38.335
(door clicks)

1:27:13.350 --> 1:27:15.683
(gun bangs)

1:27:17.360 --> 1:27:19.150
- Pop, check on Nelson.

1:27:26.564 --> 1:27:27.397
- I got 'em.

1:27:27.397 --> 1:27:28.563
You go get that guy.

1:27:28.563 --> 1:27:31.396
(Nelson groaning)

1:27:34.547 --> 1:27:35.492
You all right?
- I got it.

1:27:35.492 --> 1:27:36.325
Let's go.
- All right?

1:27:36.325 --> 1:27:37.825
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1:27:58.472 --> 1:28:01.430

1:29:05.106 --> 1:29:06.800
(gun bangs)

1:29:06.800 --> 1:29:09.161
- I will blow her fucking brains out.

1:29:09.161 --> 1:29:10.040
- [Clint] Drop the weapon!

1:29:10.040 --> 1:29:11.539
- I'll do it!
- Drop the weapon!

1:29:11.539 --> 1:29:13.226
- [Buell] Get back and shut up!

1:29:13.226 --> 1:29:14.559
(gun bangs)

1:29:14.559 --> 1:29:15.392

1:30:32.528 --> 1:30:35.111
(Joe groaning)

1:30:44.205 --> 1:30:49.205
- [Draven] Hey, Sheriff,
this makes us even.

1:30:49.266 --> 1:30:54.266
(fist thuds)
(suspenseful music)

1:30:55.894 --> 1:30:56.948

1:31:07.969 --> 1:31:10.719
(brooding music)

1:32:10.980 --> 1:32:11.813
- He's dead.

1:32:13.360 --> 1:32:14.809
What about the other two?

1:32:14.809 --> 1:32:15.809
- They're dead also.

1:32:17.490 --> 1:32:18.323
You're hurt.

1:32:20.216 --> 1:32:23.370
- I've been hurt before worse than this.

1:32:24.264 --> 1:32:25.243
I'll be all right.

1:32:26.620 --> 1:32:28.260
- We'll take care of the other ones.

1:32:28.260 --> 1:32:29.840
- Good idea.

1:32:29.840 --> 1:32:30.673
Pop, thanks.

1:32:32.616 --> 1:32:33.580
(hand tapping)

1:32:33.580 --> 1:32:34.452
You still got it.

1:32:37.333 --> 1:32:38.393
Ah, shit.

1:32:39.820 --> 1:32:41.420
It's all right.

1:32:41.420 --> 1:32:43.464
I'll see ya later, Pop.

1:32:43.464 --> 1:32:46.047
(hand tapping)

1:32:47.300 --> 1:32:49.710
- You're looking pretty tore up.

1:32:49.710 --> 1:32:50.923
I assume you prevailed.

1:32:54.080 --> 1:32:55.360
This looks like one of those times

1:32:55.360 --> 1:32:58.373
you're suppose to say, you
should see the other guy.

1:33:00.670 --> 1:33:01.503
- Yeah.

1:33:03.840 --> 1:33:05.420
How you doing, buddy?

1:33:05.420 --> 1:33:08.773
- I told you before I'm tough
ol' cuss made of callus.

1:33:11.267 --> 1:33:12.100
- That you are.

1:33:13.469 --> 1:33:15.980
- Yeah, I'm gonna hustle after Clint.

1:33:15.980 --> 1:33:17.430
I think the hard part's over.

1:33:18.309 --> 1:33:20.680
- Keep your eyes peeled on the front

1:33:20.680 --> 1:33:22.580
for an ambulance with your name on it.

1:33:25.494 --> 1:33:26.990
This is Sheriff Joe Haladin.

1:33:27.888 --> 1:33:31.719
I need an ambulance, First National Bank.

1:33:31.719 --> 1:33:33.670
One of my deputies has been shot.

1:33:33.670 --> 1:33:36.260
No, just send the ambulance right away.

1:33:37.920 --> 1:33:38.753
Thank you.

1:33:40.160 --> 1:33:42.570
- You wanna come with me, get checked out?

1:33:42.570 --> 1:33:44.620
- No, there's nothing they can do for me.

1:33:45.710 --> 1:33:47.210
I'm going home where I belong.

1:33:49.219 --> 1:33:52.930
- Oh, say hi to Carrie for me.

1:33:52.930 --> 1:33:53.763
- [Joe] Will do.

1:33:56.568 --> 1:33:57.559
(door clicks)

1:33:57.559 --> 1:33:59.976
(door bangs)

1:34:18.741 --> 1:34:22.491
- You know I could have
you charged for this.

1:34:24.300 --> 1:34:28.173
- You do what you have to do
and I'll do what I have to do.

1:34:29.120 --> 1:34:30.553
Whatever happens happens.

1:34:33.330 --> 1:34:36.976
Right now you're standing in the way

1:34:36.976 --> 1:34:38.650
of the Sheriff of Atacorta County

1:34:39.870 --> 1:34:42.900
and this is still his
stretch of Texas ground,

1:34:42.900 --> 1:34:44.383
so you best step aside.

1:34:59.057 --> 1:35:01.974
(triumphant music)

1:35:15.130 --> 1:35:18.130
(truck door clicks)

1:35:24.049 --> 1:35:26.250
(insects chirping)
(door creaking)

1:35:26.250 --> 1:35:27.610
- Joe!

1:35:27.610 --> 1:35:28.603
Joe, you're hurt.

1:35:30.050 --> 1:35:30.883
- I'm fine.

1:35:31.960 --> 1:35:33.103
Carrie.
- What?

1:35:33.103 --> 1:35:36.280
- [Joe] (laughs) I know
I did it to you again.

1:35:36.280 --> 1:35:37.887
- No.

1:35:37.887 --> 1:35:39.037
- I wronged you tonight

1:35:41.404 --> 1:35:42.545
but they were gonna use gas,

1:35:42.545 --> 1:35:46.073
I, I couldn't let 'em
do it, I just couldn't.

1:35:47.933 --> 1:35:50.450
Will you ever forgive me?

1:35:50.450 --> 1:35:53.844
- All I can think about right
now is that you're alive.

1:35:53.844 --> 1:35:55.844
That's all that matters.

1:35:57.320 --> 1:35:58.620
- That's music to my ears.

1:36:01.490 --> 1:36:02.323
- Come here.

1:36:05.290 --> 1:36:06.693
- [Joe] I love you.

1:36:06.693 --> 1:36:08.023
- I love you too.

1:36:15.715 --> 1:36:20.715
- What do you say we go
inside and put ourselves

1:36:22.100 --> 1:36:23.793
and this awful day to bed?

1:36:26.535 --> 1:36:27.679
And I may never get up.

1:36:27.679 --> 1:36:31.084
(Carrie laughs)

1:36:31.084 --> 1:36:32.723
- I think that sounds great.

1:36:34.790 --> 1:36:36.540
- [Joe] Lead the way.

1:36:38.258 --> 1:36:39.091
- Come on.

1:36:43.327 --> 1:36:44.501
- [Joe] Nelson says, hi.

1:36:44.501 --> 1:36:47.100
- [Carrie] Oh, does he.

1:36:47.100 --> 1:36:48.684
