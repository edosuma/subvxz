<i>Woman, you know you're a woman</i>

00:45.630 --> 00:47.048
<i>You got to be...</i>

00:47.132 --> 00:50.051
- There she is. Hey.
- Hi, guys.

00:50.593 --> 00:52.238
JESS: All right, baby girl.
You go, baby girl.

00:52.262 --> 00:54.222
You go, baby girl. You go, you go get it.

00:54.723 --> 00:56.808
- (CHEERING)
- Yes!

00:57.308 --> 00:59.228
- You're my baby...
- BOTH: Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba...

00:59.269 --> 01:00.549
JESS: No, no, no, don't make it.

01:00.979 --> 01:02.230
- Oh!
- Damn it!

01:02.313 --> 01:04.566
Oh... Yes!

01:04.649 --> 01:07.152
- (GAGS) Nope. I absolute...
- I got this. I got this.

01:07.235 --> 01:08.838
- I absolutely can't do it.
- Come on, Jess!

01:08.862 --> 01:10.989
But remember, this is
a stupid frat boy ritual, so...

01:11.072 --> 01:12.299
Yeah, but kick their ass! (WHOOPS)

01:12.323 --> 01:13.533
- Yeah, fuck 'em up!
- Hey.

01:13.616 --> 01:14.616
- We're together.
- No.

01:14.659 --> 01:16.453
Cool, cool, cool.

01:18.204 --> 01:19.998
- (CHEERING, GROANING)

01:20.665 --> 01:23.042

- Dude!
- (LAUGHING)

01:25.712 --> 01:27.589
Oh, God. Oh, God, Jess.

01:28.131 --> 01:29.841
Only two cups left.

01:30.133 --> 01:32.343
No, there's one cup.
You're just seeing double.

01:32.677 --> 01:35.388
Oh, God! There's only one cups left.

01:35.472 --> 01:37.366
- Oh, I can't do it. It's too much pressure.
- What?

01:37.390 --> 01:38.808
- I can't do it, Jess.
- Look...

01:38.892 --> 01:40.643
- Look at me. Look at me.
- Mmm-hmm?

01:40.727 --> 01:42.562
You got us through
the Wendy's drive-through

01:42.645 --> 01:44.647
when my car had no windshield
and three tires.

01:44.731 --> 01:46.107
(WHISPERS) You can do anything.

01:46.191 --> 01:47.835
(WHISPERING)
Yeah, but everybody's watching me,

01:47.859 --> 01:49.819
and I'm sweating like crazy.

01:49.903 --> 01:52.071
I look like a princess,
but I smell like a peasant.

01:52.155 --> 01:54.449
Let's go, foot job girl!

01:55.408 --> 01:58.203
Excuse me, she has a name! It's Alice.

01:58.286 --> 02:01.998
And she's my best friend,
and she's good and kind.

02:02.081 --> 02:03.291
BOTH: Yeah!

02:03.541 --> 02:06.586
Thank you, but I did jerk off
his roommate with my feet.

02:06.711 --> 02:08.128
I... I know.

02:08.213 --> 02:11.716
The key is, right foot
only for, like, a while.

02:11.800 --> 02:14.719
- You know? Make him beg for...
- The left one. I know. Focus!

02:15.428 --> 02:20.099
If we win this, we will be the only girls
to ever win the Halloween tournament.

02:20.225 --> 02:21.505
(WHISPERS) We've got to do this.

02:22.769 --> 02:24.604
For womankind.

02:28.233 --> 02:30.068
Stop making me horny, and shoot!

ALICE AND JESS: We did it!
We did it! We did it!

02:46.292 --> 02:48.336
- I want up! I want up! I want up!
- You deserve it.

02:48.419 --> 02:49.420
You've earned it.

02:50.755 --> 02:52.590
(WHOOPING, CHEERING)

02:52.841 --> 02:55.969
Here we go. All right. All right, yes!

02:57.470 --> 02:58.638
I'm the king of the world!

FRANKIE: Dude. Oh, God.
BLAIR: Jess?

03:05.895 --> 03:06.896
WOMAN: Are you all right?

03:06.980 --> 03:09.816
- Oh, my God, are you okay?
- Dude. Come on. Come on.

03:09.899 --> 03:12.944
- I'm fine, Mom.
- (LAUGHING) Oh, my God.

03:13.027 --> 03:14.737
What happened?

03:16.114 --> 03:18.300
Honestly, I don't even know
why we go to these stupid parties.

03:18.324 --> 03:19.593
I just want to hang out with you guys.

03:19.617 --> 03:20.970
- I know. I feel the same way.
- Yes!

03:20.994 --> 03:23.663
Everyone else at this college
is sloppy and gross.

03:23.746 --> 03:25.164
- BLAIR: Water.
- Wait, come here.

03:25.290 --> 03:26.291
Oh.

03:26.416 --> 03:28.293
- Ugh!
- Mmm. Not bad.

03:28.376 --> 03:29.895
- ALICE: Who's grosser?
- (RHYTHMIC WHIRRING)

03:29.919 --> 03:31.212
What is that?

03:31.296 --> 03:32.606
- What is that?
- What's happening?

03:32.630 --> 03:35.675
Oh, it's my vibrator,
it randomly turns on and off.

03:35.800 --> 03:37.635
(ALL LAUGHING)

03:39.721 --> 03:43.349
Oh, my God, you guys,
I'm gonna miss you so much next semester.

03:43.474 --> 03:44.994
- I don't want to talk about it.
- It's sad.

03:45.018 --> 03:46.287
- No, no, no, no.
- FRANKIE: Dude,

03:46.311 --> 03:48.396
Al Gore is guest-lecturing next semester.

03:48.479 --> 03:50.416
Maybe you don't want to go to Australia.
I don't know.

03:50.440 --> 03:52.525
- Yeah.
- On my 21st birthday, though,

03:52.859 --> 03:54.235
my dad's getting us the chopper.

03:54.319 --> 03:55.904
I said I don't want to talk about it.

03:55.987 --> 03:57.405
So I don't know what's happening.

03:57.488 --> 03:58.907
I don't even want to go. I just...

03:58.990 --> 04:01.492
It was so hard to get into
the political science program.

04:01.576 --> 04:04.037
And plus, my gym class
is bungee jumping, so...

04:04.120 --> 04:05.413
Oh, my God, wear a good bra.

04:05.496 --> 04:08.249
Well, look, we'll have
all of senior year together,

04:08.333 --> 04:11.044
and then we'll have the rest of
our lives together, so it's fine.

04:11.127 --> 04:12.921
- BLAIR: Yeah.
- You promise?

04:13.004 --> 04:16.298
You guys, our kids are gonna play together.

04:16.382 --> 04:18.259
- FRANKIE: Oh, my God!
- Oh, my gosh!

04:18.343 --> 04:20.678
- We're so lucky!
- ALICE: Get in here! Come here.

04:20.762 --> 04:22.764
- Oh. Mmm!
- (RHYTHMIC WHIRRING)

04:22.847 --> 04:25.600
- FRANKIE: Okay, that is a second vibrator.
- Yeah, I have a few.

04:25.683 --> 04:26.893
Just... Just, yeah.

04:28.186 --> 04:29.604
BLAIR: No!
JESS: Janine, no!

04:29.687 --> 04:31.314
- No! No! No!
- Janine, get out!

04:31.397 --> 04:32.899
- Come on.
- Janine!

04:32.982 --> 04:33.983
Oh, my God! Stop!

04:34.067 --> 04:35.707
- Bathroom is next-door!
- Cannot believe!

04:35.735 --> 04:37.838
- Every damn weekend with this!
- Stop! She's already peeing.

<i>What! What!</i>

(MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING)

04:47.288 --> 04:51.709
Hi. I'm Jessica Thayer,
and I'm running for state senate.

04:51.876 --> 04:55.254
<i>Crime, underfunded schools, sewage.</i>

04:55.338 --> 04:58.424
<i>These are real problems
that our community is facing.</i>

04:58.925 --> 05:02.053
<i>Looking forward to your vote on November 3.</i>

05:02.387 --> 05:03.972
<i>Thank you.</i>

05:05.390 --> 05:08.434
- It's great.
- Well, 60% of the focus group

05:08.518 --> 05:10.561
did say that it seemed
like you wouldn't put out.

05:10.895 --> 05:13.231
What? Why are they being asked that?

05:13.314 --> 05:15.817
Don't know, but 60% is, like, a lot.

05:16.359 --> 05:17.902
- Yeah.
- We're still so close.

05:17.986 --> 05:21.114
I don't understand,
Wesson literally tweeted out a dick pic.

05:21.197 --> 05:22.197
He apologized.

05:22.240 --> 05:25.034
Yes. He said, "I'm sorry, wrong dick pic,"

05:25.118 --> 05:27.328
- and then he tweeted out another one.
- (GRUNTS)

05:27.620 --> 05:30.957
Look, if Wesson wins, he's literally
gonna cut every single program

05:31.040 --> 05:32.542
that actually helps people.

05:32.625 --> 05:34.127
We know that. Right?

05:34.252 --> 05:36.713
But people want to vote
for someone they can relate to.

05:36.921 --> 05:38.339
They feel safe with Wesson.

05:38.423 --> 05:39.733
They want to have a beer with him.

05:39.757 --> 05:44.012
I'm not sure anyone
wants to have a beer with that.

Hey, Alice.

05:51.269 --> 05:54.522
Hey. I am so excited for this trip.

05:54.605 --> 05:56.899
I got my IUD taken out for Miami.

05:56.983 --> 05:58.735
Um, is that a good idea?

05:58.818 --> 06:00.737
<i>Uh, yeah. It's your bachelorette weekend.</i>

06:00.820 --> 06:02.697
Jess, Wesson tweeted out another dick pic,

06:02.780 --> 06:04.615
and it's already got 10,000 retweets.

06:04.699 --> 06:06.409
Alice, I... I got to call you back.

I'm so sorry. I got stuck at the office.

It's okay.

06:28.431 --> 06:29.849
BOTH: Mmm.

06:29.932 --> 06:32.894
- I got you chicken cashew nut, extra nut.
- Oh, no.

06:33.394 --> 06:34.896
I ate an apple

06:34.979 --> 06:38.232
and a bag of very, very
stale pretzels at the office.

06:38.316 --> 06:40.234
It was so hard to get extra nut.

06:40.318 --> 06:43.071
That woman is so mean.
She yells at me all the time.

06:43.154 --> 06:44.965
She thought I hung up,
but I heard her call me a dipshit.

06:44.989 --> 06:48.076
- How much did you tip?
- 20%.

06:48.159 --> 06:51.162
- I know. I know, I know.
- Yeah. Like, I couldn't. I...

06:51.245 --> 06:53.365
- You're just such a good person.

- It's okay, get it.
- No. I can't, I can't, I can't.

- Enough with my bachelorette itinerary.
- Ah.

07:01.047 --> 07:02.649
- Like, she's planned it to the half hour.
- Wow.

Yeah, I feel like this weekend
has come at the worst possible time.

07:06.844 --> 07:08.096
I'm so stressed out.

07:08.179 --> 07:09.889
You'll see your friends, you'll have fun.

07:09.972 --> 07:10.973
It'll be restorative.

07:11.057 --> 07:13.184
Like that time we took Xanax
and slept for 16 hours.

(SIGHS) You know, I love those girls,

07:16.938 --> 07:19.208
but I really just don't want to
have a party weekend right now.

- Mmm-hmm.
- I want to have a weekend with you.

07:22.360 --> 07:24.195
- I miss you.
- Mmm-hmm. I miss you, too.

07:24.278 --> 07:26.173

- I know.

Wait, wait, one... If we keep kissing,

07:34.122 --> 07:35.498
I'm gonna want to have sex.

07:35.790 --> 07:36.833
I'm okay with that.

07:36.916 --> 07:38.292
- I'm down.
- Okay.

07:38.376 --> 07:41.921
But I have, like, four things
I have to do before.

07:42.046 --> 07:44.886
I just have to print out those itineraries
for the city council meeting.

07:44.924 --> 07:46.801
And I have to email the <i>Herald.</i>

07:46.884 --> 07:50.304
I have, like, a 25-minute-ish interview.

07:50.388 --> 07:51.597
- Ooh. Okay.
- I...

07:51.681 --> 07:54.142
I tell you what, I'm gonna
let you do all that,

07:54.225 --> 07:56.506
and I'm gonna go masturbate
in the shower and go to sleep.

07:57.728 --> 07:59.147
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:59.897 --> 08:01.566
- You're the best.
- Well...

- This is it.

08:20.751 --> 08:22.420
Your bachelorette weekend.

08:22.503 --> 08:25.548
I have been waiting for this moment
since the first day of freshman year.

08:26.007 --> 08:28.092
- Get in here.
- You have?

08:28.217 --> 08:31.637
Oh, my God, there's gonna be
so many hot Miami babes.

08:31.721 --> 08:33.597

- Hey.

08:37.434 --> 08:39.061
And get out of here, she's mine now.

08:40.938 --> 08:42.523
Don't get in too much trouble, okay?

08:42.732 --> 08:44.984
- Yeah, I won't.
- Let's go, let's do it.

08:45.109 --> 08:46.795
Drive safe.
Have fun at your bachelor party, okay?

08:46.819 --> 08:47.904
Will do.

Hey, Alice, be careful swimming
in all that dick.

34:15.513 --> 34:17.139
How can you eat right now?

34:17.473 --> 34:20.893
Eating is the number one way
people deal with stress, okay?

34:20.976 --> 34:22.645
Don't give me shit.

34:22.728 --> 34:24.021
You guys want some?

34:24.731 --> 34:27.492
- Oh, yeah, I'd go for a slice. One second.
- I'll have a slice. Yeah.

34:27.900 --> 34:31.237
Okay, I think now it's time for us
to call the cops, yeah?

34:31.320 --> 34:33.572
Wait, wait, wait.
I think we should call a lawyer first,

34:33.656 --> 34:35.842
so we know exactly what to say
during the interrogation.

34:35.867 --> 34:37.618
- Okay.
- Wait, I'm sorry, what's going on?

34:37.909 --> 34:39.030
We're gonna be interrogated?

34:39.579 --> 34:41.831
We are 100% gonna be interrogated.

34:41.914 --> 34:44.041
Somebody died in a sketchy way.

34:44.125 --> 34:45.853
They're gonna separate
us into little cells,

34:45.877 --> 34:47.462
you know, with swinging lights.

34:47.545 --> 34:50.130
The coppers are gonna try
to crack us, fucking pigs!

34:50.422 --> 34:52.675
Okay, let's definitely call a lawyer, then.

34:53.259 --> 34:55.011
Oh, my God. My Uncle Jack.

34:55.428 --> 34:57.268
He was on the team
that defended Bernie Madoff.

34:57.346 --> 34:59.348
- Ah, thank God.
- Thank God.

34:59.849 --> 35:02.643
Wait. We should use a burner phone
so there's no record.

35:02.894 --> 35:04.496
- JESS: Good idea.
- That's actually a good point.

35:04.520 --> 35:06.355
- Shit!
- ALL: What, Alice?

35:06.689 --> 35:07.982
The foam party!

35:08.065 --> 35:09.692
Should I sell our passes?

35:10.985 --> 35:12.028
BLAIR: Wow.

35:12.612 --> 35:14.781
You're right. Let's play it by ear.

35:15.031 --> 35:16.199
Smart, Jess.

35:17.200 --> 35:18.618
(RINGTONE PLAYING)

35:18.701 --> 35:19.702
Oh, shit! Peter!

35:20.036 --> 35:21.597
- Okay.
- I forgot to call him when I got home.

35:21.621 --> 35:23.080
- Do not answer that.
- I have to.

35:23.164 --> 35:24.290
- No!
- Jess. Jess, stop.

35:24.373 --> 35:25.416
Hello!

35:25.541 --> 35:27.794
- Hey, babe.
- Hi. How's it going?

35:27.877 --> 35:29.962
- Stop.
<i>- Are you home safe? You never called.</i>

35:30.046 --> 35:31.231
- Hang up. Hang up.
- Yeah, I am.

35:31.255 --> 35:32.340
Yeah, everything's great.

35:32.507 --> 35:34.467
Did you do whippets again?
You sound really weird.

35:34.717 --> 35:36.636
- What?
<i>- Is everything all right?</i>

35:36.803 --> 35:38.683
- Hang up. Hang up. Hang up.
- Stop, stop, stop.

35:38.721 --> 35:40.515
- Peter, something really bad happened.
- No.

35:40.598 --> 35:42.433
- What?
- No, this guy came over.

35:42.517 --> 35:44.060
He was a stripper, like, a prostitute.

35:44.143 --> 35:45.329
- A prostitute?
<i>- And we were drunk,</i>

35:45.353 --> 35:47.730
and coked up, and I don't know what to do.

35:47.814 --> 35:48.981
About what? The wedding?

35:49.273 --> 35:51.668
- (FRANTIC WHISPERING)
- Jess, do you still want to get married?

35:51.692 --> 35:53.452
- You can't, you can't...
- JESS: No! (GASPS)

35:53.820 --> 35:54.987
- Jess!
- (CLICK)

35:57.240 --> 35:58.592
I can't believe you just did that.

35:58.616 --> 36:01.452
We can't talk to anybody
until we consult with a lawyer.

36:01.536 --> 36:02.703
She's right. You know what,

36:02.787 --> 36:04.890
I'm collecting everyone's phones
until we know what the plan is.

36:04.914 --> 36:06.541
- Agreed?
- Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.

36:06.624 --> 36:07.834
- Yes.
- Agreed.

36:07.917 --> 36:08.918
- Mmm-hmm.
- Fine.

36:10.753 --> 36:13.297
- Well, I have a game on it that relaxes me.
- Give it.

36:14.924 --> 36:15.967
Thank you.

36:16.175 --> 36:17.969
♪♪

36:18.344 --> 36:20.944
Okay, so we got to get this burner phone
from a convenience store.

36:21.013 --> 36:22.223
- Smart.
- Yeah, good idea.

36:22.306 --> 36:23.516
Frankie and I can go.

36:23.599 --> 36:24.684
- Great.
- ALICE: Um...

36:24.767 --> 36:27.478
- Or, like, anybody else could go.
- BLAIR: Why?

36:27.562 --> 36:30.022
- Do we argue?
- We bicker. Yeah, we bicker.

36:30.231 --> 36:32.584
- (CHUCKLES) It's true, but...
- No. I think that we debate,

36:32.608 --> 36:34.402
which is a normal part of talking.

36:34.485 --> 36:36.946
That's funny. That's the same
thing, debating and arguing.

36:37.029 --> 36:38.364
- It's semantics.
- "Semantics."

36:38.447 --> 36:40.449
Wow, I didn't realize
I was talking to a wordsmith.

36:40.533 --> 36:42.177
- They used to be lovers, yeah?
- FRANKIE: Three syllables.

36:42.201 --> 36:44.121
I'm a wordsmith 'cause
I read the news regularly.

36:44.203 --> 36:45.430
- Is it that obvious?
- BLAIR: Oh, my God.

36:45.454 --> 36:49.375
- I'm too busy shopping, right?
- I have a sort of a sense of these things.

36:49.458 --> 36:52.753
- (OTHERS CONTINUE ARGUING)
- Also, she's been fixated on her nips.

36:52.837 --> 36:54.773
Just because I don't use
Tom's of Maine deodorant, which,

36:54.797 --> 36:55.917
by the way, does not work...

36:55.965 --> 36:57.216
I don't use Tom's deodorant...

36:57.300 --> 36:59.635
- It's kind of nasty to watch, isn't it?
- ...into my body.

37:00.553 --> 37:02.513
PETER: Yeah, so, I call. She picks up.

37:02.847 --> 37:04.247
- Uh-huh.
- She sounds very strange.

37:04.307 --> 37:05.576
I know something's wrong immediately.

37:05.600 --> 37:07.101
And then, finally, she admits it.

37:07.184 --> 37:08.954
She says something really bad
happened with a prostitute.

37:08.978 --> 37:10.980
- OTHERS: Ooh!
- That does not mean she cheated.

37:11.355 --> 37:13.941
But if she was going to cheat,
this is when she would do it.

37:14.150 --> 37:16.819
- Oh, God.
- Miami, bachelorette party.

37:16.903 --> 37:18.738
- It's pretty classic.
- Mmm...

37:18.863 --> 37:21.991
It's not cheating if it's
with a prostitute. Technically.

37:22.325 --> 37:24.160
- TOBEY: What?
- What? Yes, it is.

37:24.243 --> 37:26.621
Look, guys, we have
to have realistic attitudes

37:26.704 --> 37:28.247
about sexual exclusivity.

37:28.497 --> 37:31.000
Whatever. It doesn't
even matter, because...

37:31.083 --> 37:32.853
I asked her if she still
wanted to get married.

37:32.877 --> 37:34.921
She screamed "no" and then she hung up!

37:35.004 --> 37:36.756
So, guess what, guys,

37:36.839 --> 37:39.175
there's no wedding for you to go to,
so return your tuxes.

37:39.383 --> 37:40.676
OTHERS: No!

37:40.760 --> 37:42.511
- No. Hell, no.
- Fine, keep your tuxes,

37:42.595 --> 37:43.846
but my wedding's off.

37:44.555 --> 37:45.806
It's not a shock, right?

37:45.890 --> 37:49.602
I mean, buddy, I love you,
you're one of my best friends,

37:49.685 --> 37:52.229
but you're a six and she's a...

37:52.313 --> 37:54.106
(TAKES BREATH) Twenty.

37:54.190 --> 37:56.525
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- JOE: He can hear you.

37:56.609 --> 37:58.569
Oh, I'm feeling... I'm feeling weak.

37:58.653 --> 38:00.255
- I'm feeling dizzy, I'm...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

38:00.279 --> 38:02.198
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Oh, my God.

38:02.365 --> 38:04.659
I knew I shouldn't date out of my league,
I knew it.

38:04.742 --> 38:07.078
When she first asked me out,
I thought it was a prank.

38:07.161 --> 38:10.081
I could feel her pulling away,
but I thought it was work.

38:10.164 --> 38:11.808
- (BELCHES) I'm gonna be sick.
- No, no, no.

38:11.832 --> 38:13.310
- Give him some Madeira.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

38:13.334 --> 38:15.419
- Yeah.
- Peter, that's it. Just take a sip.

38:15.503 --> 38:17.522
- Chug-a-lug. Bup-bup-bup-bup.
- Oh, I'll get you a soft cheese!

38:17.546 --> 38:18.547
Yes!

38:20.049 --> 38:21.467
FRANKIE: This is so stupid.

38:21.550 --> 38:25.221
Yeah, but this way no one can
definitively ID our face.

38:25.596 --> 38:27.264
FRANKIE: Old people. Perfect.

38:28.891 --> 38:31.060
Any brand is fine.

38:31.185 --> 38:32.520
What's that on your face?

38:32.770 --> 38:33.980
A detoxifying mud mask.

38:34.063 --> 38:36.148
Look, we need a burner phone, okay?

38:36.232 --> 38:40.152
- Here's some cash.
- Again, a burner phone,

38:40.236 --> 38:42.905
and you can find that behind the counter.

38:43.030 --> 38:44.740
- MAN: Okay. We heard you.
- Inside.

38:44.824 --> 38:48.035
You baby boomers are so demanding.

WOMAN: I know.

38:49.495 --> 38:51.747
- Jesus. Come on, Ma.
- I'm sick and tired of this shit.

38:53.958 --> 38:55.278
ALICE: I can't believe he's dead.

38:56.669 --> 38:59.755
- And it's, like, all my fault.
- No, no.

39:00.339 --> 39:02.717
It really is a tragedy, you know?

39:04.844 --> 39:08.347
He could have been a scientist
that was gonna cure cancer or something.

39:09.432 --> 39:11.934
- It's nice of you to say.
- Yeah.

39:13.394 --> 39:15.604
Guys, is he looking, like, straight at me?

39:18.024 --> 39:19.525
- Oh, my God, he's...
- Yeah. Yeah.

39:19.608 --> 39:21.569
He's looking at me, right? (CRIES SOFTLY)

39:21.652 --> 39:22.862

39:30.077 --> 39:31.871
She's gonna send you home.

Okay.

39:35.291 --> 39:36.625
Sleep now.

39:37.543 --> 39:39.920
- Oh, no. Jesus, no. No, no, no.
- (JESS GAGS)

39:40.046 --> 39:41.773
- Okay, why don't we...
- I don't like it, I don't like it,

39:41.797 --> 39:43.197
- I don't like it.
- Guys, I got it.

- I got it.

He looks good, right?

- PIPPA: Oh, my God, Jess. (LAUGHS)
- What?

39:59.106 --> 40:00.524
Look at this ring.

40:00.649 --> 40:02.943
It's even bigger in real life
than it is on Skype.

40:03.027 --> 40:04.653
- Yeah, he did a good job.
- Oh.

40:05.321 --> 40:06.363
You guys Skype?

40:06.655 --> 40:08.324
- Yes.
- Oh, do we?

40:08.741 --> 40:09.825
Yes.

40:10.284 --> 40:14.371
It's really nice to just sort of,
you know, see the person

40:14.580 --> 40:16.499
when you're talking to them.

40:16.874 --> 40:18.459
- I didn't know that.
- Yes.

40:18.542 --> 40:19.877
You don't know Skype?

40:19.960 --> 40:22.046
Skype is a free video calling app.

40:22.171 --> 40:23.648
- You should...
- No, I know what Skype is.

40:23.672 --> 40:25.883
Jess, you said you couldn't
remember your password.

40:27.176 --> 40:29.178
Well, it is really hard to sign in.

- Go! Go, go.

- Oh, God.

No, no, no. You're being too loud.

40:41.941 --> 40:44.002
I can speak to animals,
we have a deep understanding,

40:44.026 --> 40:45.170
- so I got this.
- MAN: Charlie?

40:45.194 --> 40:46.755

- MAN: Charlie!
- You stay. I'm bringing him to you.

40:57.623 --> 40:59.726
This is impossible, anybody can see
into the house from the beach.

40:59.750 --> 41:01.168
- This is crazy.
- I know.

41:01.252 --> 41:03.212
If someone reports it
before we do, we're dead.

41:03.546 --> 41:06.108
Well, we just... We have
to get the body out of sight, that's all.

41:06.132 --> 41:07.800
- Yeah, okay.
- All right.

41:07.883 --> 41:09.027
- Okay.
- ALICE: You all right?

41:09.051 --> 41:10.094
- You all right?
- Good.

41:10.469 --> 41:13.013
Oh, my God, Pip,
I can see all of his teeth marks.

41:13.097 --> 41:14.640
That looks really bad.

41:14.723 --> 41:16.475
No, no, no. This is...

41:16.559 --> 41:17.977
That's not... I'm good.

41:18.060 --> 41:19.770
Yeah, she's fine. Look at her in the eyes.

41:19.979 --> 41:22.398
Okay? So let's just get
the body out of sight,

41:22.481 --> 41:24.775
and then we'll put him back
before we call the cops. Yeah?

41:24.859 --> 41:26.026
- Let's do it. Right?
- Yes.

41:26.110 --> 41:27.945
- Let's go! Okay!
- Let's do it.

41:28.362 --> 41:29.882
PIPPA: Hold the door. Hang on one sec.

41:29.947 --> 41:31.716
ALICE: Got it.
JESS: There's two steps here. Hold on.

41:31.740 --> 41:33.093
- Yeah, we got it. Ow.

41:33.117 --> 41:34.118
(LOUD CRASH)

41:34.243 --> 41:35.720
PIPPA: Put him down.
ALICE: That was me.

41:35.744 --> 41:37.264
JESS: Can somebody turn the lights on?

41:37.329 --> 41:39.123
- PIPPA: I'll get it.
- Oh, there we go.

41:39.206 --> 41:40.332
- That's better.
- Oh, God!

41:40.416 --> 41:42.459
Shit! Alice, cover the body!

41:42.543 --> 41:43.878
Why? Why? Why?

41:43.961 --> 41:45.462
JESS: Pippa, what did you do?

41:46.046 --> 41:48.340
This is a poltergeist situation.

41:48.424 --> 41:49.842
I'm not doing anything.

41:49.925 --> 41:51.645
- All right.
- There's got to be a fuse box.

41:53.220 --> 41:55.556
- Oh, God. There is a taxi.
- PIPPA: Oh, no, no.

41:55.639 --> 41:57.016
There is a taxi right here.

41:57.266 --> 41:59.560
No! No, no, no.

42:00.144 --> 42:01.228
No, thank you.

42:01.478 --> 42:02.918
- Cover the body.
- Hide me. Hide me.

42:03.147 --> 42:04.481
- Balls!
- Jesus Christ.

42:04.607 --> 42:06.442
Find a quilt. Find a fucking quilt.

42:06.775 --> 42:08.652
- DRIVER: What the...
- Jesus!

42:08.777 --> 42:11.697
- Oh, no. My water broke! My water broke!
- What?

42:11.780 --> 42:12.948
No, no, I just peed.

42:13.240 --> 42:15.040
- PIPPA: I have no control over this.
- Pippa.

42:15.701 --> 42:17.536
Close, you fuck.

42:18.120 --> 42:20.307
- Here you go, sir. Thank you.
- Thought I peed. I didn't pee.

42:20.331 --> 42:22.184
- Thank you very much for the ride.
- Thank you.

42:22.208 --> 42:24.877
- Safe home!
- What the fuck is going on in here?

42:24.960 --> 42:27.000
We're starting a garage band.
Do you guys play bass?

42:27.046 --> 42:29.024
We're hiding a body.
What do you think we're doing?

42:29.048 --> 42:30.925
BLAIR: Stop saying "body" so many times.

42:31.008 --> 42:32.444
- Alice, what the hell are you doing, man?
- Sorry.

42:32.468 --> 42:33.844
- Come on.
- FRANKIE: God!

42:33.928 --> 42:35.808
Lift him up with your legs.
Lift with your legs.

42:36.347 --> 42:38.325
JESS: I swear to God,
he's getting heavier every time.

42:38.349 --> 42:39.475
Just hold one second.

42:39.558 --> 42:40.918
- There's two stairs up here.
- No!

42:40.976 --> 42:42.913
- I got it.
- Let's take a break. Let's take a break.

42:42.937 --> 42:43.979
Break, break, break.

42:44.104 --> 42:45.356
- ALICE: No, no, no.
- Okay.

42:45.481 --> 42:47.107
- Okay.
- BLAIR: I am out of shape.

42:47.191 --> 42:49.485
- PIPPA: Really good.
- Quick question.

42:50.069 --> 42:51.509
Why are we moving the dead stripper?

42:52.154 --> 42:54.240
The whole house is made out of glass.

42:54.323 --> 42:57.117
This is impossible.
You can see in everywhere.

42:57.618 --> 42:59.870
Where could we put him
that he's not gonna be seen?

43:03.832 --> 43:07.044
(SQUEAKING, CREAKING)

43:12.049 --> 43:13.652
BLAIR: (ON PHONE)
<i>So, what do you think, Uncle Jack?</i>

43:13.676 --> 43:16.428
They could charge you
with involuntary manslaughter,

43:16.512 --> 43:17.888
but it's not that easy to prove.

43:18.013 --> 43:19.640
- Ah, thank God.
- Well, that's not bad.

43:19.723 --> 43:21.368
- That's okay.
- JACK: <i>Just don't touch the body</i>

43:21.392 --> 43:23.936
<i>- or the scene, and you'll be fine.</i>
- What?

43:24.019 --> 43:26.146
Okay, so actually,
we have already moved him

43:26.230 --> 43:27.439
to a sex swing, Your Honor.

43:27.773 --> 43:28.816
What?

43:28.899 --> 43:32.778
I said, "Actually, we have already
moved him to a sex swing, Your Honor."

43:32.861 --> 43:33.988
<i>I heard you.</i>

43:35.197 --> 43:37.116
You knowingly tampered with the scene,

43:37.199 --> 43:39.451
<i>which means you're guilty
of accessory after the fact,</i>

43:39.535 --> 43:43.872
and they'll have a strong case
for involuntary manslaughter.

43:43.998 --> 43:45.624
Wait, what does that mean?

43:45.708 --> 43:47.668
<i>Up to 15 years in prison.</i>

43:47.793 --> 43:50.170
- What?
- Fifteen?

43:50.254 --> 43:52.965
- ALICE: <i>Well, what can we do?</i>
- Are we on an open line here, girls?

43:53.048 --> 43:54.883
- It's a burner phone.
<i>- Good.</i>

43:55.050 --> 43:56.719
Like I told Rob Lowe,

43:57.219 --> 44:00.889
if there's no body, there's no case.

44:04.310 --> 44:06.145
We can't just chop him up.

44:06.812 --> 44:09.815
You know what?
I'll just tell the cops it was just me.

44:10.232 --> 44:12.276
No, we all moved the body.

44:13.068 --> 44:14.320
It's a crime.

44:14.403 --> 44:17.656
Well, yeah, but if we just,
like, explain the situation...

44:17.740 --> 44:19.700
FRANKIE: What are you talking about,
"Explain"?

44:19.783 --> 44:22.453
Last year, a guy in Tampa,
he threatened to kill his wife,

44:22.536 --> 44:23.871
so she fired a warning shot,

44:23.954 --> 44:26.081
and she went to jail for 20 years.

44:26.707 --> 44:29.418
This country
should be burned to the ground!

44:31.587 --> 44:33.047
Shit.

44:34.548 --> 44:36.592
I was so close. Peter.

44:37.301 --> 44:38.761
My career.

44:38.886 --> 44:40.429
It's all over, just like that.

44:41.597 --> 44:43.515
I'm gonna do real time.

44:43.891 --> 44:44.933
Maybe life.

44:45.017 --> 44:46.536
You guys are gonna get
off with a few years.

44:46.560 --> 44:49.438
I can't do any years.
I'm in the middle of a custody battle.

44:49.772 --> 44:50.772
- What?
- What?

44:50.814 --> 44:51.857
What?

44:54.318 --> 44:56.153
Malcolm and I separated six months ago.

44:57.112 --> 44:58.364
You didn't tell me.

44:59.156 --> 45:01.075
Yeah, you've been a
little preoccupied, Jess.

45:02.159 --> 45:03.702
Why didn't you tell me?

45:04.536 --> 45:06.163
I didn't need your judgment.

45:06.455 --> 45:08.707
Blair, I would never judge you
for something like that.

45:10.501 --> 45:13.420
Oh, my God, my students.

45:13.504 --> 45:15.297
They idolize me.

45:15.381 --> 45:18.550
They think I'm, like,
the best fucking adult

45:18.634 --> 45:21.053
in the whole fucking world.

45:21.136 --> 45:22.554
They'll turn to crime.

45:23.138 --> 45:24.807
I can't go to jail.

45:24.932 --> 45:26.826
I couldn't even make it
through the first episode

45:26.850 --> 45:28.143
of <i>Orange Is the New Black.</i>

45:28.727 --> 45:29.978
(CRYING) None of us can.

45:30.145 --> 45:32.231
(SNIFFLES) It's too soapy, right?

45:32.606 --> 45:35.234
No, I meant none of us can go to jail.
(SNIFFLES)

45:35.317 --> 45:36.485
PIPPA: Wait, you guys.

45:36.777 --> 45:39.780
Even if we don't get charged
with this tampering with evidence thing,

45:39.863 --> 45:41.407
we don't know who this man is.

45:41.490 --> 45:43.242
His family could come seek revenge.

45:43.325 --> 45:46.120
He could be part of a cartel
that's gonna cut off our toes

45:46.203 --> 45:47.283
and stick them up our bums.

45:47.329 --> 45:48.330
BLAIR: She's right.

45:48.497 --> 45:51.017
We'll have to look over our shoulders
for the rest of our lives.

45:52.251 --> 45:54.002
He did say that

45:55.337 --> 45:57.756
it would be hard to convict

45:58.674 --> 46:00.843
with no body.

46:01.510 --> 46:04.388
I mean, it was an accident.

46:04.638 --> 46:06.640
And he's not part
of an escort company, you know?

46:06.723 --> 46:08.517
So I don't think anybody knows he's here.

46:09.309 --> 46:10.894
Mmm-hmm.

46:15.357 --> 46:16.692
We got to get rid of him.

46:16.859 --> 46:17.985
- We gotta, right?
- Yeah.

46:18.068 --> 46:19.194
- We do.
- We have to.

46:19.278 --> 46:21.548
- I mean, we don't want to.
- No, of course we don't want to.

46:21.572 --> 46:22.739
We didn't want to kill him.

46:22.823 --> 46:24.175
- We have no other option.
- But we have to.

46:24.199 --> 46:25.510
- Of course we have to.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

46:25.534 --> 46:26.535
Must.

46:27.077 --> 46:28.662
(LINE RINGING)

46:28.745 --> 46:30.865
ON VOICE MAIL: <i>Hey, it's Blair.
Don't leave a message.</i>

46:30.998 --> 46:33.625
Okay. That's it.
None of them are picking up.

46:33.709 --> 46:35.228
That means something really bad happened.

46:35.252 --> 46:39.006
Dude, this is, like, the third girlfriend
that's cheated on you.

46:39.423 --> 46:41.467
What is that? What's going on, buddy?

46:41.550 --> 46:43.635
Does your dick bend weird
when it gets hard?

46:43.719 --> 46:44.761
No.

46:44.887 --> 46:46.388
- All right.
- JAKE: Doesn't matter.

46:46.722 --> 46:49.725
Let's get you on Tinder right now,
so you can start on a rebound.

46:49.892 --> 46:52.561
- No, I don't want to be on Tinder, okay?
- PATRICK: Come on.

46:52.644 --> 46:55.189
You've gotten over other girls,
you can get over her.

46:55.272 --> 46:59.193
Yeah, this isn't some girl, this is Jess.
I'm not gonna get over her, you know?

46:59.276 --> 47:00.596
And I don't want to get over her.

47:00.652 --> 47:02.452
Then, this time,
do something about it, Peter.

47:02.571 --> 47:03.572
(TOBEY SCOFFS)

47:07.075 --> 47:08.285
You're right.

47:08.785 --> 47:11.055
You're right, I got to go to Miami,
and I got to win her back.

47:11.079 --> 47:13.499
- Yes, dude. Yes. Awesome.
- Okay, okay.

47:13.582 --> 47:17.461
The first flight out of Charleston
gets in at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.

47:17.544 --> 47:18.730
TOBEY: No.
JOE: Oh. There is a train

47:18.754 --> 47:22.174
that gets there tomorrow afternoon
and there's room in the quiet car.

47:22.591 --> 47:24.426
Not quick enough. You got to sad astronaut.

47:25.969 --> 47:27.095
- What?
- Huh?

47:27.679 --> 47:29.139
He has to sad astronaut.

47:29.473 --> 47:30.783
- Okay, what is that?
- JAKE: That's nothing to me.

47:30.807 --> 47:32.684
- Sad astronaut?
- TOBEY: That news story?

47:32.768 --> 47:34.937
Okay. (EXHALES)

47:35.854 --> 47:37.606
Lisa Marie Nowak was an astronaut.

47:39.691 --> 47:42.110
And she was in love
with another astronaut named Will.

47:42.736 --> 47:45.739
Now, Will cheated on Lisa
with some hottie Air Force captain.

47:45.864 --> 47:48.951
Lisa found out and was pissed.

47:49.326 --> 47:51.787
So, Lisa decided to deal with it.

47:53.038 --> 47:55.541
Once and for all.
And she got a bunch of adult diapers,

47:55.874 --> 47:57.474
so she wouldn't have to piss on the way,

47:57.584 --> 47:59.753
and she drove straight from
Houston to Orlando

47:59.962 --> 48:04.132
to, like, kidnap the Air Force...
It's... The story gets dark quick.

48:04.550 --> 48:08.428
Point is, she used that crazy
astrophysicist brain

48:09.012 --> 48:10.556
to find the quickest way to Florida.

48:11.473 --> 48:14.268
- You... You want to get Jess back, right?
- Yeah.

48:14.977 --> 48:17.771
Then you got to sad astronaut, bro.

48:19.356 --> 48:21.149

- PIETRO: Ah, yeah.
- Maybe they need our help.

50:05.837 --> 50:09.549

do their thing, you know?

What is a human friendtipede?

mouth to anus, but it's with friends,

I can't believe I'm saying this,
