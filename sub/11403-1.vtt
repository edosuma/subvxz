twelve, like, sucks.

But...I mean, chemo
sucks in general,

that blowjobs are

06:48.164 --> 06:49.409
an extremely delicate thing.

06:49.410 --> 06:50.721
You know, like if you're..

06:50.722 --> 06:51.841
if you're ranking them
on a scale of 1 to 10,

06:51.842 --> 06:53.250
1 being I'm blowing it kisses

06:53.251 --> 06:56.386
and 10 being I'm, you know,
choking on just semen,

06:56.387 --> 06:59.202
vomit just everywhere.

06:59.203 --> 07:03.074
I think you gotta start
off with 4s and with 5s.

07:03.075 --> 07:05.762
Like just enough so the...
so that you know that

07:05.763 --> 07:07.362
I know exactly what I'm doing,

07:07.363 --> 07:09.123
but with zero enthusiasm.

07:09.123 --> 07:11.073
I'm giving you nothing,

07:11.074 --> 07:12.448
because then you're
gonna be like

07:12.449 --> 07:14.081
all right, fine. I'll
just fuck her, you know?

07:14.082 --> 07:16.001
'Cause if I start off with
a 10, I got nowhere to go.

07:16.002 --> 07:17.921
I mean, why are you gonna
spend any time fucking me?

07:17.922 --> 07:19.136
You just came all over my face.

07:19.137 --> 07:19.713
So you start off small, right?

07:19.714 --> 07:20.577
But you build.

07:20.578 --> 07:21.634
I'll give you a 6

07:21.635 --> 07:24.161
after a fight, when
we're making up.

07:24.162 --> 07:25.506
And then an 8

07:25.507 --> 07:27.425
when you spend a
shitload of money on me,

07:27.426 --> 07:29.857
or get me something
that's like a sweet...

07:29.858 --> 07:32.225
gift or whatever,
I'll do full 8.

07:32.226 --> 07:34.465
But then, I circle it back.

07:34.466 --> 07:37.920
Back to the 3s, the 4s, and
the 5s, because that shit,

07:37.921 --> 07:39.266
every time, without fail,

07:39.266 --> 07:41.473
makes the guy's

when I say dick alarm.

07:44.514 --> 07:45.664

my dick harder."

say um, like, what...

08:21.792 --> 08:24.541
All this pent-up
frustration,

08:24.542 --> 08:27.421
sitting next to some dude
you're never gonna see again.

08:27.422 --> 08:28.669
That would warrant a 10.

08:29.631 --> 08:35.006
[CLEARS THROAT] Well...
How about this guy?

08:35.006 --> 08:38.238
Oh, no. I feel like I'll
definitely see you again.

08:50.782 --> 08:52.414
[GENA LAUGH]

08:52.415 --> 08:53.886
(Gena) Oh, my goodness.

08:53.887 --> 08:54.684
Bee!

08:54.685 --> 08:55.645
Look at her!

08:55.646 --> 08:56.765
Bee-Face.

08:56.765 --> 08:57.980
(Regan) Aw, Bees!

08:57.981 --> 08:58.971
(Katie) We're together again!

08:58.972 --> 08:59.327
Everything's okay, you guys.

09:00.286 --> 09:01.309
All right.

09:01.310 --> 09:03.229
How are we gonna get through
the next twelve hours?

09:03.230 --> 09:04.477
Gena brought cocaine!

09:04.478 --> 09:05.054
Oh, my god.

09:06.013 --> 09:09.211
Let's use our indoor voices, about it...
you know...

09:09.212 --> 09:10.203
Here's the deal, though.

09:10.204 --> 09:12.155
We need to do some before
the bachelorette party.

09:12.156 --> 09:13.980
Uh, it's not that
kind of a party.

09:13.981 --> 09:15.452
Hear me out.

09:15.453 --> 09:18.171
We don't want to share our
coke with rando bridesmaids.

09:18.172 --> 09:19.164
It's for us.

09:19.165 --> 09:20.091
It's true.

09:20.092 --> 09:21.052
(Becky)
Bee-yatch-faces!

09:21.053 --> 09:24.187
Ah-hah!

09:24.188 --> 09:27.835
Woo!
[LAUGH]

09:27.836 --> 09:30.843
I'm so excited, I
could buy a gun.

09:30.844 --> 09:34.491
You guys are all
here, at my wedding.

09:34.492 --> 09:37.050
Me... Isn't it just crazy?

09:37.051 --> 09:39.513
Did Regan tell you guys
just how excited I am?

09:39.514 --> 09:40.507
Yeah.

09:40.508 --> 09:40.541
I see Regan all the time.

09:41.500 --> 09:41.500
I'm sick of her.

09:42.394 --> 09:43.323
Yeah.
Feeling's mutual.

09:43.324 --> 09:45.081
I'm so sick of you.

09:45.082 --> 09:46.332
I'm sick of you, too.

09:47.258 --> 09:48.282
There's my sick, running
down your shoulder.

09:48.890 --> 09:50.106
Yuck!

09:50.107 --> 09:52.188
You are the first
Bee-Face to get married.

09:53.146 --> 09:54.142
Oh.

09:57.019 --> 09:57.977
I'm gonna cry.

09:57.978 --> 10:00.569
No, don't cry, 'cause
then I will cry too.

10:00.570 --> 10:02.009
Like when we all watched

10:02.010 --> 10:03.673
Princess Di's funeral
together, you remember that?

10:03.674 --> 10:04.792
Too soon.

10:04.793 --> 10:06.298
That was like fifteen
years ago, pal.

10:06.299 --> 10:08.250
Uh, that was like
four years ago.

10:08.251 --> 10:10.104
It was fifteen
years ago, Katie.

10:10.105 --> 10:11.577
It was five years ago.

10:11.578 --> 10:12.187
I think I know
when Lady Diana died.

10:13.146 --> 10:15.513
Did Regan explain to you
about the par-tay tonight?

10:15.514 --> 10:17.817
I was just trying to
tell them that, yes...

10:17.818 --> 10:19.768
Well, okay. It's a little
last-minute,

10:19.769 --> 10:24.153
but... We are having champagne...
(Katie) Ooh!

10:24.154 --> 10:25.591
(Becky)
...and ice cream,

10:25.592 --> 10:27.927
in our suite after
the rehearsal dinner.

10:27.928 --> 10:28.951
(Katie) Great!

10:28.952 --> 10:30.649
And then we're gonna
like, party, right?

10:30.650 --> 10:32.537
Like ah... like woo!

10:32.538 --> 10:35.479
[SNORTS] Like mm... Oh.

10:35.480 --> 10:36.344
I know.

10:36.345 --> 10:37.944
Yeah, boring.

10:37.945 --> 10:38.521
(Becky) Right.

10:38.522 --> 10:41.367
Old, boring, almost-married
lady right here.

10:41.367 --> 10:44.888
Yeah, it's just that uh,
a lot of the bridesmaids

10:44.889 --> 10:46.135
came from out of town,

10:46.136 --> 10:48.535
so I just had to keep
it really low-key.

10:48.536 --> 10:51.318
And besides, I'm not a
big partier anymore.

10:51.319 --> 10:52.825
Not like some people.

10:53.784 --> 10:55.415
These two.

10:55.416 --> 10:57.590
So... all right, well... I
think our car is waiting,

10:57.591 --> 10:58.486
so let's all go.

10:58.487 --> 10:59.510
Oh. Let's go.

10:59.511 --> 11:04.727
Byeee... We're totally gonna
keep it low-key, too.

11:04.728 --> 11:06.005
That's what we
were talking about.

11:06.006 --> 11:07.287
Just keeping
it low-key.

11:07.288 --> 11:09.240
That's the kind
of girls we are.

11:10.199 --> 11:11.415
Let's do some coke.

11:11.416 --> 11:12.502
Yes!

11:19.349 --> 11:19.349
(Gena) Look at these people,

11:20.118 --> 11:22.934
just desperate,
terrible, all of them.

11:22.935 --> 11:25.300
They want to be like, in
what, legalized slavery?

11:25.301 --> 11:26.517
That's what it is,

11:26.518 --> 11:28.214
it's like a Jane
Austen novel on crack.

11:28.215 --> 11:29.781
That's exactly right.

11:29.782 --> 11:30.902
Should we do some more coke?

11:31.798 --> 11:31.798
If you do anymore coke,

11:32.566 --> 11:34.452
somebody's dick is
gonna get sucked.

11:34.453 --> 11:41.557

beautiful daughter.

are you feeling
confident about tomorrow?

11:48.275 --> 11:49.940
Your walk down the aisle
was a little bumpy.

11:49.941 --> 11:50.899
Was it bumpy?

11:50.964 --> 11:50.965
I don't remember it being bumpy.

11:51.924 --> 11:51.924
Are you kidding?

don't we, Victoria?

He's handsome and funny.

11:57.077 --> 11:58.164

Are you married, Trevor?

11:58.165 --> 11:59.764
No.

11:59.765 --> 12:00.625
Oh. Yeah. No, no.

12:00.626 --> 12:01.585
I'm trying, though.

12:01.586 --> 12:02.642
I'm just, you know...

12:02.643 --> 12:03.636
haven't found the
right girl yet.

12:03.637 --> 12:04.946
Hey.

12:04.947 --> 12:05.588
You know how Becky
wanted to keep it low-key?

12:05.589 --> 12:09.459
Well... I got a stripper for
the bachelorette party.

12:09.459 --> 12:10.452
Stop your lies.

12:10.453 --> 12:13.011
You don't know any strippers.

12:13.012 --> 12:14.066
I do.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.883
I know a freelance stripper.

12:16.884 --> 12:18.358
That sounds amazing.

12:22.867 --> 12:23.699
(Katie) What's going on?

12:48.082 --> 12:50.705
(Katie) I just don't know...
how to do it.

12:50.706 --> 12:53.265
Like in a bathtub,
with rope... I just

12:53.266 --> 12:54.129
I gotta go do something.

12:54.130 --> 12:55.184
Okay.

12:55.185 --> 12:56.241
Please don't leave me alone.

12:56.242 --> 12:58.258
Now honey, why can't you
find a nice man like this?

12:58.258 --> 12:58.258
Hmm?

12:58.992 --> 13:00.144
Oh, come on.

13:00.145 --> 13:01.041
Frank is never
gonna commit to you.

13:01.042 --> 13:02.832
Frank?
Who's Frank?

13:02.833 --> 13:03.823
(Victoria) Her boyfriend.

13:03.824 --> 13:04.943
He's doing his residency.

13:04.944 --> 13:06.063
He'll be here tomorrow.

13:06.064 --> 13:06.959
Yeah... Wow.

13:06.960 --> 13:07.887
I bet he's busy a lot.

13:07.888 --> 13:09.102
Tough to commit that way.

13:09.103 --> 13:10.065
Let's just say
hi to Aunt Janey, okay?

13:10.066 --> 13:11.759
You don't want to be rude.

13:11.760 --> 13:13.686
If you get bored,
I'll be right here.

13:18.481 --> 13:19.376
(Bartender)
Can I get you anything?

13:19.377 --> 13:21.135

Do you...?

13:34.798 --> 13:35.758
Do you have a job?

13:35.759 --> 13:36.909
A job?
Like out- like a...

13:36.910 --> 13:38.604
yeah, I have a job um,
uh, in the world.

13:38.605 --> 13:39.919
computer programming, actually.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.646
Like a Steve Jobs
kind of thing?

13:41.647 --> 13:44.365
Uh, hmm, kind- err, no.

13:44.366 --> 13:45.678
Not at all, actually.

13:45.679 --> 13:47.085
I didn't found Apple.

13:47.086 --> 13:47.151
You don't remember me, do you?

13:48.110 --> 13:50.380
Ah... The honeymoon
is a total surprise.

13:50.381 --> 13:53.037
I haven't told her yet, but
I'm gonna blow her mind.

13:53.038 --> 13:54.060
Boar hunting?

13:54.061 --> 13:55.055
We're going to central Germany.

13:55.056 --> 13:57.810
It's incredible. We should...
Gena?

14:02.605 --> 14:03.310
Hi...

14:04.269 --> 14:05.262
Hi, Clyde.

14:05.262 --> 14:08.717
I haven't seen you since...
...that thing.

14:08.718 --> 14:11.565
...since that thing I
grew up next to Becky,

14:11.566 --> 14:14.285
so I was kind of around a lot.

14:14.286 --> 14:15.083
We would hang out
a little bit, and then

14:15.084 --> 14:17.038
into high school, we were
in French class together.

14:17.038 --> 14:17.038
Wait.
I took French?

14:17.645 --> 14:18.250
Yes.

14:18.251 --> 14:19.790
You actually used to
copy my homework.

14:20.749 --> 14:22.092
But no,
it's-it's good.

14:22.093 --> 14:24.844
I just wanted to say hi, and...
and uh...

14:24.845 --> 14:26.412
say the hellos.

14:26.413 --> 14:27.755
I-I sold you pot.

14:27.756 --> 14:30.764
Oh, Joe!

14:30.765 --> 14:31.755
That's-that's me.

14:31.756 --> 14:32.620
You've got bangs!

14:32.621 --> 14:34.123
Yeah, new bangs.

14:34.124 --> 14:35.531
Do you have some?

14:35.532 --> 14:37.389
Remember how I was telling you
about the Bee-Faces,

14:37.390 --> 14:38.635

14:38.796 --> 14:40.172
This is Gena Myers,
she's one of them.

14:40.173 --> 14:41.258
Oh, hi.

14:41.259 --> 14:42.987
Gena, this is my
sister, Stefanie.

14:42.988 --> 14:44.586
Nice to meet you,
Mrs. Myers.

14:44.587 --> 14:45.836
Oh, no.
I'm not married.

14:45.837 --> 14:48.970
And um, I'm not an
adult, either, so...

14:48.971 --> 14:50.028
(Dale) Excuse me for a second.

14:50.029 --> 14:51.563
The natives are
getting restless.

14:51.564 --> 14:55.658
Oh... You two know each other from...
...high school.

14:55.659 --> 14:56.905
...since I was your age.

14:59.884 --> 15:02.250
All right. I'm gonna go
sit down, but um... Okay.

15:02.251 --> 15:03.178
...will you come
sit next to me?

15:03.179 --> 15:05.771
Uh, well, whatever those
little place-cards say, okay?

15:06.283 --> 15:07.917
Bye...

15:10.794 --> 15:11.435
What?

15:12.394 --> 15:13.481
I didn't say anything.

15:13.482 --> 15:15.977
That is a... dress?

15:15.978 --> 15:17.610
No, this is a T-shirt.

15:17.611 --> 15:20.169
I'm glad to see you're still
fighting the good fight

15:20.170 --> 15:21.097
against the tyranny of pants.

15:21.098 --> 15:22.216
I also thought maybe

15:22.217 --> 15:23.655
this would help you
get a head-start.

15:23.656 --> 15:25.418
Maybe I'm looking
for a challenge.

15:25.419 --> 15:28.296
Oh... is that why...

15:28.297 --> 15:30.696
you're trying to
fuck a small child?

15:30.697 --> 15:31.785
Good one.

15:31.786 --> 15:33.064
You know what you should do?

15:33.065 --> 15:35.081
Save the zingers for
the speeches, Genny.

15:39.241 --> 15:40.231
Okay.

15:40.232 --> 15:41.383
Our seventh-grade field trip

15:41.384 --> 15:42.599
to Six Flags is
coming to a close.

15:42.600 --> 15:43.785
We're all piling on
the bus to go home.

15:43.786 --> 15:45.448
Dale lags behind,

15:45.449 --> 15:47.305
'cause he just has
to ride the Freefall

15:47.306 --> 15:48.616
at the last minute.

15:48.617 --> 15:50.121
So he's running like
hell to catch up to us,

15:50.121 --> 15:51.783
and he just bites it.

15:51.784 --> 15:54.888
Wipes out completely, spills
what must be two liters

15:54.889 --> 15:57.000
of Dr. Pepper all over his
shorts, [GUEST LAUGHTER]

15:57.001 --> 15:58.087
just epic.

15:58.088 --> 16:00.613
So later, he and I are sitting
in the back of the bus,

16:00.614 --> 16:04.647
and I get a whiff of
Dr. Pepper and piss.

16:04.648 --> 16:07.303
And I say, "You know,
it'd be pretty funny

16:07.304 --> 16:10.918
if you pissed your
pants riding Freefall,

16:10.919 --> 16:12.616
and then spilled Dr. Pepper
all over yourself

16:12.617 --> 16:14.855
to try, cover it up."

16:14.856 --> 16:17.991
And he turns to me, and he
goes, "Yes, it would be.

16:17.992 --> 16:19.718
But it would also
be kinda genius.

16:19.719 --> 16:21.030
[LAUGHTER]

16:21.031 --> 16:22.501
Classic Dale.

16:22.502 --> 16:24.805
Classic Dale.

16:24.806 --> 16:26.373
Thank you, Trevor.

16:26.374 --> 16:27.397
You weren't supposed
to make your speech

16:27.398 --> 16:30.629
'til tomorrow, but... it's fine.

16:30.630 --> 16:32.422
Now we have a special surprise

16:32.423 --> 16:33.510
from the bride's cousins.

[GUEST CLAPPING]

16:39.173 --> 16:40.808

16:43.685 --> 16:44.549
Yo, Becky?

16:44.549 --> 16:44.549
Say what?

16:45.158 --> 16:46.051
Yo, Dale?

Okay. What we need right now

25:09.069 --> 25:11.051
is like an epically
brilliant plan, you know?

25:11.052 --> 25:12.362
That's what we need.

So are you ready?

25:15.306 --> 25:17.419
I'm gonna call Melissa, the
girl we got the dress from.

25:17.420 --> 25:19.656

brilliant fucking plan!

25:19.657 --> 25:20.744
How much cash you have?

25:20.745 --> 25:22.345
I got five maxed
out credit cards.

25:22.346 --> 25:23.338
I have a twenty-dollar...
I ripped it.

gonna get in,

it's a little on the nose

25:47.241 --> 25:48.231
that I'm going to strip club

25:48.232 --> 25:49.290
the night before my wedding,

25:49.291 --> 25:50.760
but you know, I'm fine with it

25:50.761 --> 25:52.039
because the commitment
we're about to make,

25:52.040 --> 25:53.000
that's what it's about.

25:52.041 --> 25:53.223

dude with the blindfold,

I am also not really into this.

26:01.898 --> 26:03.400
Yeah, you weren't blindfolded,

26:10.890 --> 26:13.256

26:13.257 --> 26:14.823
That was not part
of the deal, Trevor.

26:14.824 --> 26:16.967
No, because we gave up
strip clubs for lent, so...

you were a little girl

so much better on you,

very diplomatic

30:38.971 --> 30:40.761
and say let it fucking go?

No!

30:41.883 --> 30:43.321
I'm not gonna
watch Becky Archer

30:43.547 --> 30:46.041
walk down the aisle
in my dream dress.

30:46.042 --> 30:47.418
I'd rather lick this sidewalk.

Lick the sidewalk,
then, please.

30:49.817 --> 30:50.777

30:49.818 --> 30:51.193
Don't be ridiculous.

30:51.194 --> 30:52.154
You don't lick the sidewalk.

30:52.155 --> 30:54.171
You lick the sidewalk,
I'll let it go.

30:56.089 --> 30:56.089
A little lick.

30:56.697 --> 30:57.657
Like a cat lick.

30:57.658 --> 30:59.330
Like a cat lick.

31:07.002 --> 31:07.864
Ugh.

31:07.865 --> 31:09.495
(Gena) Be encouraging.

31:09.496 --> 31:11.097
I'm mentally preparing myself.

31:11.098 --> 31:13.431
(Gena) Just do it fast, please.

31:13.432 --> 31:14.425
Like you're ripping
off a Band-Aid

31:14.426 --> 31:15.864

31:15.865 --> 31:17.497
(Katie)
Becky can't wear that dress.

31:17.498 --> 31:20.088
A-a biased cut would
look awful on her.

31:20.089 --> 31:21.366
It utilizes the
stretch of the fabric

31:21.367 --> 31:23.609
in a diagonal direction,
accentuating body lines.

31:23.610 --> 31:27.386
It would fit her like a silk
stuffed sausage casing.

31:30.263 --> 31:31.192
Rain man?

31:32.151 --> 31:34.902
How did you know all
that stuff, just now?

31:34.903 --> 31:36.346
I spent a semester at F.I.T.

31:38.264 --> 31:39.895
Yes?

31:39.896 --> 31:41.847
Do you know how to sew things?

31:41.848 --> 31:42.552
Oh.

31:44.470 --> 31:46.296
Of course I know how to sew.

31:47.255 --> 31:48.917
Oh. Okay.

31:48.918 --> 31:50.934
Are you ready to Betsy Ross
the shit out of this dress?

31:50.934 --> 31:50.934
Yes.

31:51.383 --> 31:52.342
Good.

31:52.343 --> 31:52.982
This tastes like gasoline.

31:52.983 --> 31:54.198
Good.

31:54.198 --> 31:54.966
'Cause you love
the smell of gasoline.

31:54.967 --> 31:55.925
It's perfect.

31:56.151 --> 31:58.005
We should get some magic
markers while we're here!

31:58.006 --> 31:58.677
Oh, wait.

31:58.678 --> 31:59.605
I know a guy who can
get us marijuana.

31:59.990 --> 32:00.662
Ted.

32:00.663 --> 32:01.685
Joe.

32:01.686 --> 32:02.708
You should throw
that guy a bone.

32:02.709 --> 32:03.413
Who, Ted?

32:03.414 --> 32:04.469
Joe!

32:04.470 --> 32:05.237
I bet he's super good in bed.

32:05.237 --> 32:05.237
(Katie) What?

32:05.781 --> 32:06.740
(Gena) Yeah.

32:06.741 --> 32:07.699
Why would you say that?

32:07.700 --> 32:09.044
Have you ever fucked a guy

32:09.045 --> 32:10.036
who like never got
laid in high school?

32:10.037 --> 32:11.283
But how would I know that?

32:11.284 --> 32:13.140
Oh, 'cause they're just
really good at it.

32:13.140 --> 32:14.355
They're really good at sex,

32:14.356 --> 32:15.443
'cause they had to wait
for it for so long.

32:15.444 --> 32:16.661
It's like a total
Krakow situation.

32:16.662 --> 32:18.004
Krakow?

32:18.005 --> 32:19.990
Brian Krakow, from
My So Called Life.

32:19.991 --> 32:21.205
Come on.

32:21.206 --> 32:22.708
Okay, listen to me.

32:22.709 --> 32:24.054
There are two different
types of guys in bed.

32:24.055 --> 32:25.043
Mm-hmm.

32:25.044 --> 32:26.291
Number one, Brian Krakow.

32:26.292 --> 32:28.821
Didn't have sex 'til
college, super grateful.

32:28.822 --> 32:31.315
Literally makes
a home down here,

32:31.316 --> 32:33.268
sets up shop, wants
to live in it.

32:33.269 --> 32:35.092
Number two, Jordan Catalano.

32:35.093 --> 32:36.338
Won't go near the area.

32:36.339 --> 32:37.170
Terrified of it.

32:37.171 --> 32:39.282
Very good looking, but you
know, not worth the time.

32:39.283 --> 32:41.138
If you ask me-...
What are you doing?

32:41.139 --> 32:43.634
Why do you have the baby
out of the garbage bag?

32:43.635 --> 32:45.171
I'm matching the thread
color to the dress.

32:45.172 --> 32:46.546
Uh, it's a wedding dress.

32:46.547 --> 32:47.603
I think maybe it's white.

32:47.604 --> 32:49.747
(Katie)
Oh, actually...it's ivory.

32:49.748 --> 32:51.858
Actually, it's pearl.

32:51.859 --> 32:52.721
Okay.
You know what?

32:52.722 --> 32:54.481
Knowing stuff like that does
not make you guys cool.

32:54.482 --> 32:55.155
It makes you... Amazing?

32:55.667 --> 32:56.627
Gorgeous?

32:56.628 --> 32:57.682
Incredible?

32:57.683 --> 32:59.091
God blessed me
with perfect tits.

32:59.092 --> 33:01.010
It's only right that
people should know that.

33:01.011 --> 33:02.867

makes you stupid.

33:03.955 --> 33:06.257

keeps texting me.

33:06.258 --> 33:07.667
He wants us to go to
that strip club.

33:07.668 --> 33:09.651
Oh! Guys, we have to
go to a strip club.

33:09.652 --> 33:10.545
Please?

33:13.043 --> 33:15.185
Okay.
How fast can you sew?

33:15.186 --> 33:16.850
It'll be faster if I
had a sewing machine.

33:16.851 --> 33:18.258
Oh, my god.

33:18.259 --> 33:19.602
You know who could
get us a sewing machine?

33:19.603 --> 33:21.073
Catalano.

33:21.073 --> 33:23.537
No. More like looks like Krakow

33:23.538 --> 33:25.009
and treats you like Catalano.

33:25.010 --> 33:27.120
free your ming and
the rest will follow...

33:27.121 --> 33:29.776
I'm the President

You want a dance, handsome?

33:32.113 --> 33:35.121
Oh, I'm-I'm good. Err, uh,
I mean, I'm not- help...

33:35.122 --> 33:36.882
what are the parameters
gonna be, for such a dance?

33:36.882 --> 33:38.865
Jesus Christ almighty.

33:38.866 --> 33:40.336
He said you're not his type.

33:40.337 --> 33:42.192
Okay, I'm talking
to the retard here.

33:42.193 --> 33:43.407
Snap!

33:43.408 --> 33:45.424
Here's twenty dollars.
Leave us alone.

33:45.425 --> 33:47.919
Look, it's just like
taking a woman on a date.

33:47.920 --> 33:51.728
You just have to make her
feel terrible about herself.

33:51.729 --> 33:52.784
Same goes for strippers.

33:52.785 --> 33:54.128
(Joe) I am so sorry

33:54.129 --> 33:56.208
that he's referring to you
in-in such a manner.

33:56.209 --> 33:57.519
Does it look like
it bothers her?

33:57.520 --> 33:58.417
She's doesn't give a shit.

33:58.418 --> 33:59.888
Here you go.

33:59.889 --> 34:01.616

34:02.446 --> 34:03.246
Thank you very much.

34:03.247 --> 34:04.145
That was terrible.

34:05.104 --> 34:06.639
Oh, shit!

34:06.640 --> 34:08.045
I got a text from Hannibal.

34:08.045 --> 34:09.614
Looks like some
sluts are on their way.

34:09.614 --> 34:10.637

34:11.856 --> 34:12.909
Yes.

see you guys tomorrow.

I got a table booked downtown.

34:17.679 --> 34:19.949
(Trevor) We've got bottles
(Clyde) Where are you going?

34:19.949 --> 34:20.876
I've got wedding
photos in the morning.

34:20.877 --> 34:21.933
That is a dick move.

34:21.934 --> 34:23.085
This is like a classy place.

34:23.085 --> 34:24.525
(Dale)
I've got a wedding tomorrow!

34:24.525 --> 34:25.710
This is like the
Harvard of strip clubs.

Hey, Joe. I'm gonna
make sure Lector

34:26.893 --> 34:28.237

prom queen for you,

34:28.237 --> 34:29.261
'cause I'm gonna
make it my mission

34:29.262 --> 34:30.253
to get you in that tonight.

34:30.254 --> 34:31.533
That's awesome,
but I-I-I...

34:31.534 --> 34:33.452
can we stop referring
to her as a "that"?

34:33.453 --> 34:34.862
All right.
You in, Clyde?

34:34.862 --> 34:37.103
No, I got something
else going on here.

34:39.021 --> 34:40.974
No, no, no. No females
without a male escort.

34:40.975 --> 34:41.869
What?

34:41.870 --> 34:44.011
That's really sexist,
and homophobic,

34:44.012 --> 34:45.710
because you don't...
you don't know us.

34:45.710 --> 34:46.955
We could be lesbians.

34:46.956 --> 34:47.916
These are my girlfriends.
What the fuck?

34:47.917 --> 34:48.556
All right.

34:49.966 --> 34:51.214
just call us prostitutes?

Did you just call
us prostitutes?

35:05.229 --> 35:06.571
It's okay.
They're with me.

35:06.572 --> 35:07.659
Hey, you don't have
to pay for it.

35:07.660 --> 35:09.645

...at Scores?

like to go to the Oscars.

Ew... it's like Iran in here.

35:43.401 --> 35:44.552

go find the bathroom,

35:44.553 --> 35:45.641
and I'm gonna clean
off the dress.

(Regan) Okay, we'll find Clyde.

35:46.634 --> 35:47.563
She's not a stripper, right?

35:48.491 --> 35:49.737

Listen, if I'm not
out in five minutes,

35:52.107 --> 35:55.048

claim the body.

such beautiful dancers,

to give money to.

36:17.257 --> 36:18.632
That's so sweet.

36:18.633 --> 36:19.943
I always ask them
their stories, too.

like where they... Oh.

to smoke pot with you?

actually a good idea?

36:29.160 --> 36:30.309
Please. I need a
break from "that".

We're not calling her "that".

We're trying
not to call her "that".

I called her "that" earlier.

I'm a little bored now.

anything you can do

36:47.079 --> 36:48.998
to help Joe score with Katie?

36:48.999 --> 36:49.766
No.

36:49.767 --> 36:51.175
Why?

36:51.176 --> 36:52.390
I'm a completely
powerless figurehead.

36:52.391 --> 36:54.278
I'm like Truman at Geneva.

36:54.279 --> 36:56.293
You mean Truman at Potsdam?

36:56.294 --> 37:01.158
I think I know what
I'm talking about.

37:01.159 --> 37:04.038
Truman inherited the presidency
because Roosevelt died.

37:04.039 --> 37:05.574
Poor fuck got sworn in,

37:05.575 --> 37:07.973
flown to Potsdam to deal
with Stalin and Churchill,

37:07.974 --> 37:10.086
figure out what the fuck to do
with post-war Germany

37:10.087 --> 37:11.588
and all of Europe.

37:11.589 --> 37:13.637
Geneva conference is
completely different thing.

37:13.638 --> 37:16.293
So I think you meant
Truman at Potsdam.

37:16.294 --> 37:20.133
Oh. I switched it, 'cause
I'm a little drunk.

37:20.134 --> 37:21.219
It wouldn't have
made sense anyway,

37:21.220 --> 37:24.325
because Truman had the trump
card, he had the Bomb.

37:24.326 --> 37:27.018
So really, he was in
control the whole time.

37:31.813 --> 37:34.788
Oh, do you believe in magic?

37:34.789 --> 37:36.997
Yes, I do.
That's... abso- yes.

37:36.998 --> 37:38.564
Do you believe in
a magic vagina?

37:38.565 --> 37:38.789
A magic vagina?

37:39.748 --> 37:41.221
It would bewitch
you with its magic.

37:41.222 --> 37:43.331
I've been bewitched
by vaginas before.

37:43.332 --> 37:45.572
It's scary, actually.

37:45.573 --> 37:47.139
I think I might be stupid.

37:47.140 --> 37:48.516
Why would you say
that about yourself?

37:48.517 --> 37:50.020
I don't understand anything

37:50.021 --> 37:52.066
anyone is talking about,
most of the time.

37:52.067 --> 37:52.198
That has nothing
to do with intelligence.

37:53.157 --> 37:54.755
It's like this...

37:54.756 --> 37:56.163
there's lots of different
kinds of smart,

37:56.164 --> 37:57.508
you know, and you just

37:57.509 --> 38:00.419
have to discover
which smart you are.

38:00.420 --> 38:02.724
See, I-I don't understand
what you just said.

38:02.724 --> 38:04.418
That's okay, neither do I.

38:04.419 --> 38:07.139
Be honest, would you
marry a stripper?

38:07.140 --> 38:12.450
Um... Shh... shh...
shh... shh...

38:12.451 --> 38:14.019
There's no touching allowed.

38:14.019 --> 38:15.106
Okay.

38:15.107 --> 38:16.706
Did you know that?

38:16.707 --> 38:20.131
I... did- hadn't really...
We're not allowed to touch.

38:20.132 --> 38:21.506
Okay. Well, I'm not...

38:21.507 --> 38:22.755
I mean, my hands
are down. I'm not...

38:22.756 --> 38:25.377
Mm-mm... But if you
wanted to, you could.

38:25.378 --> 38:28.481
I'm confused. It's not
allowed, but I can?

38:28.482 --> 38:31.073
If you wanted to
touch me, you could.

38:31.074 --> 38:32.704
I'm gonna give it a shot. Okay.

38:32.705 --> 38:33.537
Okay.

38:33.538 --> 38:34.595
Just... all right.

38:34.596 --> 38:38.082
Mm-hmm.
That's $200.

38:38.083 --> 38:39.041
That's $200?

38:39.202 --> 38:39.969
Mm-hmm.

38:40.002 --> 38:42.176
That's $200?

38:42.177 --> 38:44.607
Two-zero-zero.

38:44.608 --> 38:46.914
Okay. Well, I-I mean, I
feel like that's a...

38:46.915 --> 38:51.429
that's a-a pretty good...
deal...

38:55.265 --> 38:56.483
Oh, Genny.

38:58.401 --> 38:59.208
(Stripper) These guys suck.

39:06.880 --> 39:08.606
Hand full of splooge.

39:08.607 --> 39:09.727
Been there.

39:09.728 --> 39:10.974
Is it your first night?

39:10.975 --> 39:13.983
No... but pretty rad

39:13.984 --> 39:16.481
that you think I'm
hot enough to work here.

39:17.440 --> 39:18.336
You okay?

39:18.337 --> 39:19.614
No. Because...

39:19.615 --> 39:22.175
my stupid ex-boyfriend's
in the back right now,

39:22.176 --> 39:24.190
getting humped by some skank.

39:24.191 --> 39:25.120
No offense.

39:25.121 --> 39:26.079
We are skanks.

39:26.208 --> 39:26.208
It's so dumb.

39:26.943 --> 39:28.317
Like honestly,

39:28.318 --> 39:29.950
I don't even know why I'm
freaking out about it.

39:29.951 --> 39:31.548
I should be fixing the dress,
not obsessing over him,

39:31.549 --> 39:33.789
Look, the only reason why Romeo
is back there is because

39:33.790 --> 39:35.391
he knows he's not
getting laid tonight.

39:35.392 --> 39:36.509
It's true.

39:36.510 --> 39:37.696
Yeah. I mean, if he thought
he had a chance with you,

39:38.655 --> 39:39.839
he would be all over your ass,

39:39.840 --> 39:43.198
like a fat kid eating cake.

39:43.199 --> 39:44.286
Thanks.

39:44.286 --> 39:45.342
Yeah. Men are all
sorts of fucked.

39:45.343 --> 39:47.101
They feel insecure
for one second

39:47.102 --> 39:48.766
and they need
to go feel powerful

39:48.767 --> 39:49.852
for a couple of hours.

39:49.853 --> 39:50.973
Women feel shitty
about themselves

39:50.974 --> 39:52.667
and they just go
cry in the bathroom.

39:52.668 --> 39:53.312
Yeah.

39:55.230 --> 39:57.917
Or they stab each
other in the back.

39:57.918 --> 39:59.038
Yeah, I guess
there's that, too.

39:59.039 --> 40:00.477
Yeah.

40:00.478 --> 40:01.725
Oh, that's good.

40:03.580 --> 40:04.731
Yeah.

40:04.732 --> 40:05.820
I should like,
do this more often,

40:05.821 --> 40:07.645
come to these
bathrooms, you know.

40:07.646 --> 40:11.964
So much cheaper than going
to a fucking therapist.

40:11.965 --> 40:12.891
Yeah!

40:12.892 --> 40:14.077
All right!

40:14.078 --> 40:15.262
That's great. Thank you.

40:17.180 --> 40:18.845
Regan!

40:19.804 --> 40:21.851
(Trevor) Whoa, we're still having...
What is that?

40:21.852 --> 40:21.852
I need to talk
to her for a second.

40:22.620 --> 40:23.930
Where's Katie?

40:23.931 --> 40:25.243
I don't know. This place
is like a fucking maze.

40:25.244 --> 40:25.947
Okay. Well, we gotta
get out of here

40:25.948 --> 40:26.845
if we're ever gonna...
We need to find Clyde...

40:27.420 --> 40:29.338
No to get the sewing machine.

40:29.339 --> 40:30.299
No, it's a change of plans.

40:32.476 --> 40:34.364
Do you think they'd
let me work here,

40:34.365 --> 40:36.123
if I take my clothes off?

40:36.124 --> 40:37.913
Oh, my god. You
let her smoke pot?

40:37.914 --> 40:39.098
I can't control her.

40:39.099 --> 40:40.123
You can't control her.

40:40.124 --> 40:41.594
That's hilarious.

40:41.595 --> 40:42.235
Why are you talking about
me like I'm not here?

40:42.236 --> 40:43.611
I'm calling Becky,

40:43.612 --> 40:44.697
and I'm telling her
about the dress,

40:44.698 --> 40:45.881
'cause I can't
handle this anymore.

40:45.882 --> 40:47.065
Hah! So you can be
the big fucking hero?

40:47.066 --> 40:48.377
No! I'm the only
one doing anything!

40:48.378 --> 40:49.498
You don't handle shit!

40:49.499 --> 40:50.555
I handle shit.

40:50.556 --> 40:52.283
(Katie) ...and I handle shit...
What's the plan, Gena?

40:52.284 --> 40:53.530
It doesn't matter!

40:53.531 --> 40:55.032
I'm just telling her
about the fucking dress.

40:55.033 --> 40:55.640
What happens when all the
fucking responsibility

40:55.641 --> 40:56.506
comes down on you?

40:56.506 --> 40:56.506
You're gonna call me...

40:57.211 --> 40:57.945
No.

40:57.946 --> 40:58.617
Yeah, you are.

40:58.618 --> 41:00.825
You're gonna call me, and
I'll fucking handle it

41:00.826 --> 41:01.976
Just like I handled
your abortion,

41:01.977 --> 41:03.198
because I had to
fucking drive you.

41:07.034 --> 41:12.697
(Katie) You guys had an
abortion without me?

41:12.698 --> 41:12.698
Okay.

41:13.370 --> 41:13.818
I'm sorry.

41:13.818 --> 41:13.818
No.

41:14.522 --> 41:15.833
Gena, stop.

41:15.834 --> 41:17.273
What is that shit?

41:17.274 --> 41:18.683
I-I didn't even get to come?

41:19.642 --> 41:20.951
Clyde, I need you to help me.

41:20.952 --> 41:21.626
Security!

41:21.627 --> 41:23.000
Clyde! Come on.

41:23.001 --> 41:25.305
No, he can't leave.
He owes me $200.

41:25.306 --> 41:26.361
See this?

41:26.362 --> 41:27.640
It's worth a lot
of money, okay?

41:27.641 --> 41:29.080
So don't blow it
all in one place.

41:31.833 --> 41:33.560
See you later.

41:33.561 --> 41:34.520
Whatever.

41:35.705 --> 41:37.624
(Regan) Wait, Gena!

41:37.625 --> 41:38.935
Fuck you!

41:38.936 --> 41:40.535
(Trevor)
You're a bad-ass.

41:40.536 --> 41:41.560
Wait! No, no, no, no.

41:41.561 --> 41:42.999
Oh, no.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.142
We're not getting on
the floor tonight. Nope.

41:45.143 --> 41:47.030
We're going... Do I
still look okay?

41:47.031 --> 41:48.153
We're going home now, okay?

41:48.154 --> 41:49.751
She really goes
from 60 to zero.

41:49.752 --> 41:50.743
No, you're not going home.

41:50.744 --> 41:52.215
You said you needed a break.

41:52.216 --> 41:53.175
(Regan) That was before.

41:52.216 --> 41:53.077
(Trevor) You're not going home.

41:53.078 --> 41:54.232
Joe, take Katie home.

41:54.233 --> 41:55.734
Whoa. Who is Joe?

41:55.735 --> 41:56.437
He's right behind you.

41:56.438 --> 41:56.981
I'm Joe.

41:56.982 --> 41:58.102
(Trevor) Hello.

41:58.103 --> 41:58.998
Here's what's happening.

41:58.999 --> 42:00.821
You're staying with
me, call your friend,

42:00.822 --> 42:02.934
as soon as she picks up
I'll take you right to her.

42:02.935 --> 42:03.861
The most efficient
way of handling it.

42:03.862 --> 42:05.750
Wait, wait, wait. Um... Sorry.

42:05.751 --> 42:09.429
Think I'm gonna be sick...
No, I'm good. I'm good.

42:09.430 --> 42:10.295
(Trevor) She's good!

42:10.295 --> 42:10.295
I'm good.

42:11.094 --> 42:12.437
(Joe) Okay.

42:12.438 --> 42:14.454
(Trevor)
Aw... Young love.

42:14.455 --> 42:15.255
(Katie)
All right. Okay.

42:15.256 --> 42:16.277
(Joe) Okay.

42:16.278 --> 42:17.621
(Regan) You wanna throw up?

42:17.622 --> 42:18.197
Here, let me take
you to throw up.

42:18.198 --> 42:19.092
Uh-uh, I'm good.

42:19.093 --> 42:19.893
No, come on. Let's go.

42:19.894 --> 42:21.141
Joe, come here.

42:21.142 --> 42:22.452
What the fuck is
wrong with you, man?

42:22.453 --> 42:23.028
I'm trying to get
you alone with her.

42:23.029 --> 42:23.863
She's GTG, man.

42:23.864 --> 42:25.396
What's GTG again?

42:25.397 --> 42:26.196
Good to go!

42:26.197 --> 42:27.189
She's good to go!

42:27.190 --> 42:28.853
Take her home and slip it in.

42:28.854 --> 42:30.133
I'm not gonna slip it in.

42:30.134 --> 42:31.413
She is wasted,
that'd be like rape.

42:31.414 --> 42:32.916
(Joe) Slipping it in to a girl

42:32.917 --> 42:34.132
that's about to pass out...?

42:34.132 --> 42:35.414
I'm telling you, take these.

42:35.415 --> 42:37.076
That'll help.

42:37.077 --> 42:38.133
What are these?
Are these...

42:38.134 --> 42:39.989
dude, are these
date rape drugs?

42:39.990 --> 42:40.854
They're fucking Xanax,
dude, for you.

42:41.813 --> 42:41.814
You're fucking paranoid.

42:42.773 --> 42:43.766
You smoked too much.

42:43.767 --> 42:45.396
Would you relax?

42:45.397 --> 42:45.845
What am I doing?

42:45.846 --> 42:47.027
[SLAP]

42:47.028 --> 42:48.436
[SLAP]

42:48.437 --> 42:49.333
[SLAP]

42:49.333 --> 42:50.226
All right.

42:50.227 --> 42:50.933
I like to see you man up.

42:50.934 --> 42:53.461
Now, do you want Regan,
or do you want Katie?

42:54.291 --> 42:55.381
You can take her.

42:56.211 --> 42:57.330
Katie's hotter.

42:57.331 --> 42:58.133
Yeah. Good call.

42:59.092 --> 42:59.092
Look, she's throwing
up right now,

42:59.988 --> 43:00.916
that's not so hot.

43:00.917 --> 43:02.868
What is wrong with you?

43:02.869 --> 43:03.412
I don't know.

43:05.044 --> 43:06.004
(Regan) Hey.

43:06.005 --> 43:06.005
(Regan) Thank you, Joe.

43:06.708 --> 43:07.572
All good?

43:07.573 --> 43:09.491
All right.
Yeah. Yeah.

43:09.491 --> 43:10.450
(Trevor)
so Joe's going with Katie...

43:09.491 --> 43:10.002
(Regan) You're going with Joe.

43:10.003 --> 43:10.802
Great. Yeah.

43:10.803 --> 43:12.851
We're GTG, we're good to go.

43:12.852 --> 43:14.098
(Trevor)
Okay. Perfect

43:15.699 --> 43:16.467
GTG?

43:16.468 --> 43:17.425
Yeah, GTG what?

43:17.426 --> 43:18.354
Why you stealin' my shit?

43:18.354 --> 43:19.347
I didn't hear you say that.

43:19.348 --> 43:20.658
(Trevor) That's my line.

43:20.659 --> 43:22.997
This is the best night
of my life, you guys!

43:24.915 --> 43:26.834
How can you not
have a Metro card?

43:26.835 --> 43:29.266
Uh, because I live
in Los Angeles?

43:29.267 --> 43:32.113
Yeah, but you've been
here for like a day.

43:32.114 --> 43:34.608
Thank you, Gena, for
helping me get out of

43:34.609 --> 43:36.818
that sticky situation
with that wasted stripper

43:36.819 --> 43:38.449
that I could not pay for.

43:38.450 --> 43:39.471
Oh, you're so welcome, Clyde.

43:39.472 --> 43:40.623
Are you kidding?

43:40.624 --> 43:41.682
I could have paid
for the stripper,

43:41.683 --> 43:44.084
if you hadn't taken my wallet.

43:46.961 --> 43:47.027
How long are you gonna

43:47.986 --> 43:49.136
pretend to be mad at me, Gena?

43:49.137 --> 43:50.288
It's starting to
hurt my feelings.

43:50.289 --> 43:51.218
Listen to me.

43:51.219 --> 43:53.681
I've got like mere hours

43:53.682 --> 43:55.984
to get this dress
fixed and cleaned,

43:55.985 --> 43:57.874
and make sure nothing
else happens to it,

43:57.875 --> 44:00.879
so I am so sorry, Clyde,
that your feelings are

44:00.880 --> 44:01.873
not at the top of my list

44:01.874 --> 44:03.727
of things to give a shit about.

44:03.728 --> 44:05.777
Wow, so you're
actually mad at me.

44:05.778 --> 44:07.637
That's interesting.

44:11.473 --> 44:15.216
You know what You got
pregnant a long time

44:15.217 --> 44:16.943
- years ago.

44:16.944 --> 44:18.702
And I felt bad
about it ever since.

44:18.703 --> 44:19.633
And you know,
there's this thing,

44:20.592 --> 44:23.343
it's called life, and we
have to get on with it.

44:23.344 --> 44:24.814
We got pregnant.

44:24.815 --> 44:26.223
I took care of it.

44:26.224 --> 44:27.408
You made mix tapes about it.

44:27.409 --> 44:29.519
I-I was 18.

44:29.520 --> 44:30.767
I was 15.

44:30.768 --> 44:33.461
You were 16, and
we were in love.

44:39.215 --> 44:40.591
Remember Fast Times?

44:40.592 --> 44:41.327
Fast Times?

44:41.328 --> 44:42.637
You remember that movie?

44:42.638 --> 44:43.790
Do you remember
who the bad guy was?

44:43.791 --> 44:45.070
It was Damone.

44:45.071 --> 44:49.293
The asshole didn't show
up for the appointment.

44:49.294 --> 44:49.935
That's you, mother fucker.

44:49.936 --> 44:52.589
I am not I am not Damone!

44:52.590 --> 44:53.615
I'm not Damone!

44:53.616 --> 44:56.430
I can't believe you cannot
see that you are Damone.

44:55.471 --> 44:58.066
Don't call me ...dude, don't
call me fucking Damone...

45:00.943 --> 45:02.124
What do you want me
to do about it now?

45:02.125 --> 45:03.980
I just want you to
help me fix the dress.

45:03.981 --> 45:05.166
I don't want to
have this conversation.

45:05.167 --> 45:07.122
I just want to fix the dress.

45:12.876 --> 45:15.148
And chemo when you're 12 sucks.

45:15.149 --> 45:15.790
Yeah, it's gotta suck.

45:15.791 --> 45:18.413
I mean, 12 sucks in general,

45:18.414 --> 45:21.868
