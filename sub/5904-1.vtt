01:41.351 --> 01:42.807
Help!

01:48.400 --> 01:50.641
- Eddie.
- What?

01:50.986 --> 01:52.851
Eddie! Wake up!

01:52.946 --> 01:55.153
- Don't move. Okay listen to me.
- Where are we?

01:55.240 --> 01:58.357
- Whatever you do, don't lean forward.
- What's this? What's...

01:58.452 --> 02:00.238
- What's going on?
- No!

02:07.836 --> 02:11.579
<i>Hello. I want to play a game</i>.

02:13.008 --> 02:18.594
<i>The devices on your heads are symbol
of the shackles that you place upon others.</i>

02:18.680 --> 02:23.174
<i>You recklessly loan people money.
Knowing their financial limitations.</i>

02:23.268 --> 02:27.637
<i>Counting on repossessing
more than they could ever pay back.</i>

02:28.190 --> 02:32.604
<i>You are predators,
but today, you become the prey.</i>

02:37.366 --> 02:40.654
<i>The scale before you
is your only path to freedom.</i>

02:40.744 --> 02:44.612
<i>However, only one of you may pass,</i>

02:44.706 --> 02:48.290
<i>and the toll is the ultimate sacrifice,</i>

02:48.460 --> 02:50.621
<i>the sacrifice of flesh.</i>

02:51.421 --> 02:55.460
<i>Before you are the instruments
to exact this flesh.</i>

02:55.550 --> 02:57.086
<i>Move with haste, though,</i>

02:57.177 --> 03:00.260
<i>for when the 60-second timer hits zero,</i>

03:00.347 --> 03:04.807
<i>the one who has given the most flesh
will release their bindings,</i>

03:04.893 --> 03:10.479
<i>while the gears on your opponent's head
will engage, piercing their skull.</i>

03:10.565 --> 03:14.774
<i>Who will offer the most flesh
in order to save their life?</i>

03:14.861 --> 03:16.476
<i>The choice is yours.</i>

03:16.571 --> 03:17.721
No!

03:29.459 --> 03:31.666
I'm not dying for you, bitch!

05:04.846 --> 05:06.052
No!

06:29.222 --> 06:31.258
<i>I ask you. Special Agent Strahm.</i>

06:33.435 --> 06:35.471
<i>Have you learned enough to trust me?</i>

06:35.562 --> 06:39.521
<i>For if you do not,
this room will forever be your tomb.</i>

06:39.608 --> 06:43.942
<i>You will never be heard from again,
your body will never be found,</i>

06:44.029 --> 06:46.315
<i>and my legacy will become yours.</i>

06:46.948 --> 06:48.563
<i>Make your choice.</i>

08:03.817 --> 08:05.353
There was a pre-existing condition,

08:05.443 --> 08:08.185
which you did not inform
your insurance company of.

08:12.033 --> 08:13.364
Thank you.

08:15.912 --> 08:21.452
Hey, babe. Good. Listen, I am so, so sorry,
but I can't make dinner.

08:23.545 --> 08:26.912
I've got to work late again.
Well, I've got to meet with legal,

08:27.007 --> 08:31.376
and that's going to jam me up
for, certainly, the rest of the afternoon.

08:33.554 --> 08:37.764
I know it's your birthday.
I'm going to make it up to you, I promise.

08:41.145 --> 08:42.385
Love you.

08:45.400 --> 08:48.767
- What were we talking about?
- We're talking about your deposition.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.012
Don't worry about me, Debbie.

08:50.071 --> 08:52.062
Some small-time lawyer
trying to squeeze us

08:52.157 --> 08:54.113
is not gonna get me to say
anything I don't want to say.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.440
I have no doubt about that,

08:55.535 --> 08:58.902
but as lead counsel for this company,
if you screw up, it comes down on my ass.

08:58.997 --> 09:01.989
So, what do you say
we prep your deposition?

09:02.083 --> 09:03.414
Christ.

09:03.501 --> 09:05.537
Do you remember dealing
with a Mr. Harold Abbott?

09:05.628 --> 09:07.869
William, I have a Casey Patterson on line 1.

09:07.964 --> 09:11.673
Take another message, Addy.
I'll get back to her this week.

09:11.760 --> 09:14.001
Some time. Keep going.

09:14.095 --> 09:17.303
When opposing counsel asks you
about Mr. Abbott, how will you respond?

09:17.390 --> 09:19.221
I am going to respond by saying,

09:19.309 --> 09:22.176
as Senior Vice President
of Membership and Claims,

09:22.270 --> 09:25.182
it is my job
to review every terminated policy.

09:25.273 --> 09:27.855
As a matter of fact, Mr. Abbott
was sitting right where you are now

09:27.942 --> 09:29.933
when we discussed his appeal.

09:32.113 --> 09:33.944
I just... I don't get it.

09:34.032 --> 09:36.944
I've been with this insurance company
for over 10 years.

09:37.035 --> 09:40.277
I know, Harold. But, unfortunately,
when we reviewed your claim,

09:40.371 --> 09:43.283
we discovered that you failed to mention
a previous condition.

09:43.374 --> 09:46.081
What condition? There was no condition.

09:47.045 --> 09:50.879
It says here you had oral surgery
to remove a cyst from your jaw.

09:50.965 --> 09:52.956
This is absurd! I have heart disease.

09:53.051 --> 09:55.884
It has nothing to do with some oral surgery
I had 30 years ago.

09:55.970 --> 09:59.212
Any type of oral surgery
is going to leave scar tissue.

09:59.307 --> 10:01.013
Scar tissue can lead to gum disease.

10:01.101 --> 10:04.764
And, as you well know,
gum disease can cause heart disease.

10:05.313 --> 10:08.180
You know what? You're... You're a criminal.

10:09.526 --> 10:12.142
You are a goddamn criminal.

10:13.154 --> 10:16.897
I paid my monthly premium for 10 years
without so much as a cold.

10:16.991 --> 10:19.733
And now that I'm actually sick,
you're going to deny my coverage?

10:19.828 --> 10:22.820
- I have a family!
- Those are the rules, Harold.

10:22.914 --> 10:26.077
I'm sorry,
but your own actions have caused this.

10:27.961 --> 10:32.421
You've just given me a death sentence.
I mean, who's going to cover me now?

10:32.507 --> 10:34.168
You just killed me.

10:36.886 --> 10:40.049
I have family, too,
so I can empathize with his argument.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.096
But, basically,
the guy lied on his application.

10:42.183 --> 10:45.095
- Hey. Watch it, Will.
- What?

10:45.186 --> 10:47.598
Do you think he did that on purpose?

10:48.064 --> 10:49.395
All right.

10:50.400 --> 10:53.358
It wasn't my job
to assess what his intentions were.

10:53.444 --> 10:55.935
It was my job
to check the accuracy of his claim.

10:56.030 --> 10:58.112
Look, everybody thinks we're the bad guys.

10:58.199 --> 11:01.783
Nobody mentions the millions of people
we help every year without incident

11:01.870 --> 11:05.408
or the millions of dollars
we donate to charity every year

11:05.498 --> 11:07.204
or all the free clinics we support.

11:07.292 --> 11:09.999
- Short answers, Will. Short answers.
- <i>Today in probate court,</i>

11:10.086 --> 11:14.204
<i>the assets for one of history's
most notorious serial killers, John Kramer,</i>

11:14.299 --> 11:15.584
<i>were distributed.</i>

11:15.675 --> 11:19.133
<i>They were mainly in real estate holdings.
But in my time researching...</i>

11:19.220 --> 11:22.633
One more question.
Who found the error on his application?

11:22.724 --> 11:26.216
The dog pit. They work as a team.

11:27.395 --> 11:30.093
If there's a discrepancy to be
found in an application,

11:30.193 --> 11:31.709
the six of them will find it.

11:31.774 --> 11:33.981
Sir, they're waiting for you
in the conference room.

11:34.068 --> 11:35.218
Very good.

11:35.612 --> 11:38.820
- How's it going today, people?
- Great, Mr. E.

11:39.782 --> 11:42.364
Found two application errors
for a chronically ill client.

11:42.452 --> 11:44.818
This guy practically lives
at his doctor's office.

11:44.913 --> 11:47.655
I mean, this could probably save us
nearly 200K over his lifetime.

11:47.749 --> 11:49.159
Terminator strikes again.

11:49.250 --> 11:51.411
I'll be back in a few hours.

11:51.753 --> 11:53.539
Looking good, Hank.

11:55.757 --> 12:00.000
<i>Who will offer the most flesh
in order to save their life?</i>

12:00.094 --> 12:01.800
<i>The choice is yours.</i>

12:01.888 --> 12:04.220
<i>I'm not dying for you, bitch!</i>

12:14.567 --> 12:15.717
Yeah.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.727
I'm on my way.

12:32.861 --> 12:34.041
What's going on?

12:34.128 --> 12:37.461
Feds who took over the crime scene
are requesting you ASAP.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.342
Erickson.

12:51.646 --> 12:54.228
I didn't know you ever made it out
from behind the desk.

12:54.315 --> 12:58.308
I make exceptions when fingerprints
are found at a Jigsaw murder scene.

13:00.405 --> 13:01.815
Have a look.

13:04.242 --> 13:06.984
We also got a right index off the scale.

13:07.787 --> 13:11.496
- Been ID'd yet?
- Yeah. They're Agent Strahm's.

13:12.959 --> 13:16.872
When I learned that he and Perez
were being targeted by Jigsaw,

13:16.963 --> 13:20.751
I should have been more aware.
But I didn't see this coming.

13:20.842 --> 13:22.082
Not from Peter Strahm.

13:22.176 --> 13:24.667
- It was a shock to all of us.
- Yeah.

13:25.847 --> 13:29.339
But we have something
he doesn't know about.

13:31.519 --> 13:33.384
You want to follow me?

13:39.193 --> 13:40.433
Lindsey.

13:44.449 --> 13:47.156
- Detective Hoffman.
- Perez.

13:52.040 --> 13:53.655
It was my call, Detective.

13:53.750 --> 13:55.456
I knew that Jigsaw wasn't working alone,

13:55.543 --> 13:58.000
but until I knew for certain
who was helping him,

13:58.087 --> 14:00.294
I couldn't guarantee her well-being.

14:00.381 --> 14:04.875
- So you let me think she was dead?
- Well, I didn't know who I could trust.

14:06.387 --> 14:08.799
What else have you been keeping from me?

14:08.890 --> 14:12.178
We know that Agent Strahm knew
the five people in the real estate scam,

14:12.268 --> 14:14.384
the victims from the traps
that Erickson found.

14:14.479 --> 14:16.561
- How'd he know them?
- Strahm and I investigated them

14:16.647 --> 14:17.797
after the house fire.

14:17.857 --> 14:20.394
It was arson
and all five people were accountable.

14:20.485 --> 14:24.148
But after our lone witness went missing,
no charges were ever filed.

14:24.947 --> 14:27.563
Strahm couldn't let them get away,
so he put them in a trap

14:27.658 --> 14:29.990
in which slaughtering each other
was the only way out.

14:30.078 --> 14:31.818
So, what are you telling me,
he's a vigilante?

14:31.913 --> 14:34.950
Call him whatever you like,
but he has to be found.

14:39.629 --> 14:41.995
We'd like to work together on this.

14:42.548 --> 14:45.665
You led me to believe that she was dead,
and you want to work with me?

14:45.760 --> 14:48.251
Look, we're offering full disclosure,
Detective.

14:48.346 --> 14:52.305
From now on, everything we know,
you know. Is that fair?

15:01.776 --> 15:03.641
Detective Hoffman,
how about a quick word?

15:03.736 --> 15:06.694
Pamela Jenkins,
the resident Jigsaw sensationalist.

15:06.781 --> 15:08.237
Just reporting the facts, Detective.

15:08.324 --> 15:12.693
Is that what you're doing?
"John Kramer, conundrum of carnage."

15:12.787 --> 15:14.323
If you'd like to make a statement
on the record,

15:14.414 --> 15:15.870
I'd be more than happy to take it.

15:15.957 --> 15:19.745
You know, twisting the facts
to make a better story is irresponsible.

15:19.836 --> 15:22.043
Excuse me. Nice catching up.

15:22.130 --> 15:25.418
I know more about John Kramer
than you might think.

15:25.975 --> 15:27.255
Somehow I doubt that.

15:27.343 --> 15:31.131
Kramer left his wife a box in his will.
Did you know that?

15:31.222 --> 15:33.964
Maybe I did, maybe I didn't.
How do you know it?

15:34.058 --> 15:37.346
Probate court. It's public record
for those who know where to look.

15:37.437 --> 15:40.019
All right. What do you really want?

15:40.106 --> 15:45.191
Jill Tuck. Help me get to her
and I'll dial down on the sensationalism.

15:45.278 --> 15:48.645
Really? I'll see what I can do.

15:57.373 --> 16:00.206
Do you remember
how you were transported there?

16:00.293 --> 16:02.500
I don't know how I got there.

16:04.672 --> 16:08.631
Just opened my eyes and...
He did this to me.

16:09.343 --> 16:10.799
Who did this?

16:12.346 --> 16:13.927
Jigsaw.

16:14.015 --> 16:18.224
- You didn't cut your own arm off?
- I did. I did.

16:19.145 --> 16:20.931
But he made me do it.

16:22.023 --> 16:23.263
And why is that?

16:23.357 --> 16:26.849
Because what Eddie and I were doing
was wrong.

16:28.863 --> 16:31.696
We were... We were ruining people's lives.

16:36.579 --> 16:38.615
And he wanted us to learn.

16:39.582 --> 16:40.992
And did you?

16:43.920 --> 16:45.285
Look at me.

16:47.048 --> 16:49.585
Look at my goddamn arm!

16:49.675 --> 16:52.792
What the fuck am I supposed to learn
from this, huh?

16:52.887 --> 16:57.130
Look at my arm! What...
What am I supposed to learn from this?

16:57.225 --> 16:58.681
- Just breathe.
- Look at me!

17:05.483 --> 17:07.314
<i>Hello, Gideon.</i>

17:08.486 --> 17:11.944
<i>- It's a good name, hon.
- Wow, wow.</i>

17:12.031 --> 17:15.615
<i>Could have been Scarlet.
But, no, has to be a boy.</i>

17:15.701 --> 17:18.909
<i>Let me see
if I can get all three of us in there.</i>

17:19.664 --> 17:23.748
<i>Snuggle around here.
Lean inside. There we go.</i>

17:24.877 --> 17:26.617
<i>- There we are.
- Hey, Gideon.</i>

17:26.712 --> 17:28.998
<i>Here's a little happy family.</i>

17:29.090 --> 17:31.422
<i>- We love you, Son. We're waiting for you.
- We love you.</i>

17:42.728 --> 17:44.935
<i>Gideon, Gideon, Gideon.</i>

17:45.648 --> 17:49.436
<i>If you're watching this, Jill,
I'm long gone from this world.</i>

17:50.653 --> 17:56.239
<i>I'm leaving you a box today,
and its contents are of grave importance.</i>

18:35.156 --> 18:38.614
<i>Hello. I'm not in right now,
but please leave a message.</i>

18:38.701 --> 18:41.659
<i>Miss Tuck, this Is Pamela Jenkins calling,
yet again.</i>

18:41.746 --> 18:44.488
<i>I was hoping you can clear some things up
for me about your husband.</i>

18:44.582 --> 18:46.072
<i>Let me buy you lunch or a cup of coffee.</i>

18:46.167 --> 18:49.204
<i>I've found something interesting
about John Kramer's death.</i>

18:49.712 --> 18:51.703
<i>Are you there, Detective?</i>

18:52.673 --> 18:57.167
<i>By hearing this tape,
you will likely assume this is over.</i>

18:58.471 --> 19:00.757
<i>You feel you now have control, don't you?</i>

19:02.683 --> 19:05.345
<i>You think you will walk away untested.</i>

19:10.775 --> 19:12.106
Look here.

19:12.860 --> 19:16.273
These are the Jigsaw pieces
cut from previous victims.

19:18.699 --> 19:21.691
This is the piece
taken from the latest victim.

19:22.495 --> 19:25.908
- It looks like all the rest.
- Yeah, that's what we said, too.

19:25.998 --> 19:30.332
The skin abrasions, they're indicative
of a knife with a partially serrated edge.

19:33.214 --> 19:35.375
- So?
- So, all of the other cuts were made

19:35.466 --> 19:37.502
with a near-perfect blade
of surgical quality.

19:40.888 --> 19:43.379
Obviously, Strahm used a different knife
than John Kramer.

19:43.474 --> 19:47.308
Right. But it got us curious,
so we pulled the files to compare.

19:47.395 --> 19:49.932
That same knife was used
on only one other victim.

19:50.022 --> 19:51.762
And that victim was Seth Baxter,

19:52.233 --> 19:54.519
the man who killed your sister.

19:55.569 --> 19:59.938
You're telling me that you can tell
a different knife was used from a photo?

20:00.032 --> 20:03.945
No, but I can.
I was the one who examined that body.

20:04.745 --> 20:07.327
I've examined every victim
of the Jigsaw Killer.

20:07.415 --> 20:08.495
Good work.

20:08.582 --> 20:12.825
The tape from the latest victim was missing,
so we're looking into the Seth Baxter tape.

20:12.920 --> 20:16.458
- Why's that?
- Well, if a different person cut the piece,

20:16.549 --> 20:19.666
then maybe a different person
made the tape, too.

20:20.344 --> 20:22.676
- Strahm?
- Yeah, maybe.

20:23.389 --> 20:25.630
Strahm's voice on that tape
would be our smoking gun.

20:25.725 --> 20:29.013
If we had that,
we'd go public with his involvement.

20:34.233 --> 20:35.564
Hey, Jill.

20:38.237 --> 20:41.149
- But that's not what the prescription...
- I'm sick!

20:41.240 --> 20:43.697
- Look at me! Look at me!
- Hey. It's okay. Sorry.

21:00.801 --> 21:03.588
I didn't expect to see you here so soon.

21:04.346 --> 21:05.961
Change of plans.

21:07.141 --> 21:10.975
- The game begins tonight.
- Why?

21:11.103 --> 21:13.719
Because somebody knows about the box
that shouldn't.

21:13.814 --> 21:15.679
- Who?
- That's not your concern.

21:15.775 --> 21:20.394
All you need to know is that from now on,
I control all aspects of the game.

21:21.155 --> 21:23.316
That's not what John wanted.

21:23.991 --> 21:27.154
Give me the envelopes.
And that's not a request.

21:37.797 --> 21:38.947
Here.

21:41.509 --> 21:44.046
From now on, I work alone.

21:44.553 --> 21:48.512
I know.
I'm only carrying out John's final request.

21:48.599 --> 21:51.841
Well, John's dead.
And his work is almost done.

21:56.524 --> 21:58.936
- Who's this?
- Unfinished business.

22:02.196 --> 22:06.906
When I'm done, we no longer speak.

22:19.129 --> 22:20.710
Let my hand go.

22:22.216 --> 22:26.710
Methadone is a masking agent.
It doesn't heal, it simply numbs the senses.

22:28.264 --> 22:30.255
I've found a better way.

22:32.101 --> 22:37.721
These people, they will continue to hurt you
and let you down.

22:38.274 --> 22:40.811
They're addicts, John.
Recovery is a process.

22:40.901 --> 22:44.143
Maybe addiction's just part
of human nature.

22:44.238 --> 22:49.528
But what about these people, Jill,
who come here every day and use you?

22:49.618 --> 22:54.328
They bide their time.
They're avoiding prison sentences.

22:54.415 --> 22:58.078
They're getting hooked on masking agents.
Do you call that recovery?

22:58.168 --> 22:59.783
It's not that simple.

22:59.879 --> 23:04.088
Addiction is not simple, Jill! Wake up!

23:05.759 --> 23:11.129
These people have no respect
for the lives that they're destroying.

23:11.807 --> 23:14.924
Once you see death up close,

23:19.189 --> 23:21.931
then you know what the value of life is.

23:24.695 --> 23:26.356
And that's my way.

23:27.740 --> 23:30.447
And I brought proof that it works.

23:38.125 --> 23:41.288
- Amanda?
- Hello, Jill.

23:44.089 --> 23:45.239
Jill,

23:47.468 --> 23:51.381
you once told me that she was a lost soul.

23:53.766 --> 23:55.552
But here she stands.

23:56.435 --> 23:59.302
She's clean and whole.

24:01.482 --> 24:05.350
And she has a new appreciation for her life.

24:06.236 --> 24:10.479
It works. It's real. He helped me.

24:28.467 --> 24:31.800
<i>...as this is not just
the macabre conjectures of a psychic,</i>

24:31.887 --> 24:35.675
<i>but a foregone conclusion
just waiting to rear its ugly head.</i>

24:36.392 --> 24:41.352
<i>Even though police would have you believe
John Kramer, aka Jigsaw, Is dead,</i>

24:41.480 --> 24:46.099
<i>just this past week a new so-called game
was discovered with grisly results.</i>

24:46.193 --> 24:48.104
<i>Victims have included anyone associated</i>

24:48.195 --> 24:51.437
<i>with the life of John Kramer,
however remote.</i>

24:51.532 --> 24:55.696
<i>The Jigsaw Killer may be dead,
but the murders continue.</i>

25:05.337 --> 25:06.487
Shit!

25:10.384 --> 25:12.170
Hank, you still here?

25:45.002 --> 25:46.742
Don't fucking move.

25:54.928 --> 25:57.544
Shit! Oh, fuck! Okay.

25:58.015 --> 26:01.883
Okay, I'm gonna take care of you. Just...
Where'd you get hit? You wearing a vest?

26:42.309 --> 26:43.719
<i>Hello, William.</i>

26:43.811 --> 26:45.221
Oh, Jesus.

26:45.312 --> 26:49.351
<i>You've probably been wondering
when we would see each other again.</i>

26:49.733 --> 26:52.065
<i>- Today is that day.</i>
- No!

26:52.152 --> 26:57.067
<i>For years, your probability formula
has decided the fate of others.</i>

26:57.157 --> 26:58.442
<i>The healthy have benefited</i>

26:58.534 --> 27:02.402
<i>while the potentially sick
have been unjustly rejected.</i>

27:02.496 --> 27:07.206
<i>However, this formula does not take
into account the human will to live.</i>

27:07.292 --> 27:08.748
<i>When faced with death,</i>

27:08.836 --> 27:13.705
<i>who should live versus who will live
are two entirely separate things.</i>

27:14.133 --> 27:17.000
<i>Today, your policy will be put to the test.</i>

27:17.094 --> 27:22.134
<i>There are four straps around your limbs,
and you have four tests you must complete,</i>

27:22.766 --> 27:27.931
<i>for if you don't, the straps On your arms
and legs will detonate.</i>

27:30.482 --> 27:31.938
<i>Look closely.</i>

27:35.737 --> 27:37.102
Oh, shit!

27:37.197 --> 27:42.408
<i>You have 60 minutes to complete your tests
and avoid this fate, startling now.</i>

27:43.662 --> 27:45.653
<i>You are not alone in this game.</i>

27:45.747 --> 27:48.614
<i>Just as you have taken loved ones away
from their families,</i>

27:48.709 --> 27:51.542
<i>if you don't reach the end
before the timer hilts zero,</i>

27:51.628 --> 27:53.914
<i>you will never see your family again.</i>

27:57.050 --> 28:02.261
Mom? Mom! Mom. Mom, wake up! Mom.

28:04.600 --> 28:06.386
Mom.

28:06.476 --> 28:09.718
- Where are we?
- I don't know.

28:10.147 --> 28:12.889
- What is this?
- I don't know! Look.

28:18.405 --> 28:19.770
Oh, my God.

28:22.576 --> 28:24.737
<i>Here is your first test.</i>

28:25.287 --> 28:30.247
<i>Your health and hereditary background
put you in the highest category of success.</i>

28:30.584 --> 28:33.872
<i>However, the same cannot be said
for your adversary.</i>

28:35.714 --> 28:40.378
<i>While only 52 years of age,
this man has continued to smoke</i>

28:40.469 --> 28:44.929
<i>even though he has a history
of high blood pressure and heart disease.</i>

28:45.015 --> 28:49.975
<i>This demonstrates very little appreciation
for the blessings of his own life.</i>

28:50.062 --> 28:54.931
<i>Your game will focus
on the simple element of air.</i>

28:55.025 --> 28:58.893
<i>Once this game begins,
every time you take a breath,</i>

28:58.987 --> 29:03.401
<i>the clamps around your chest will close in
and crush your body.</i>

29:03.492 --> 29:07.451
<i>The only escape is in the other's failure.</i>

29:07.537 --> 29:11.371
<i>So I ask you, when faced with death,
who will survive?</i>

29:12.793 --> 29:16.456
<i>Live or die, William. Make your choice.</i>

29:17.422 --> 29:20.334
- Fuck you!
- Who the hell is that?

29:26.348 --> 29:27.963
Hold your breath!

31:18.001 --> 31:21.334
What the fuck? Oh, Jesus!

31:53.912 --> 31:55.652
Come on! Come on!

32:04.714 --> 32:05.864
Shit!

32:14.266 --> 32:16.257
Please help us!

32:16.351 --> 32:20.890
Help us! Someone, please! Please! Help us!

32:21.356 --> 32:27.192
Somebody, please! Please!
Please, somebody help!

32:28.029 --> 32:29.644
Anybody?

32:29.906 --> 32:32.693
"Live. Die." What the fuck?

32:35.787 --> 32:37.823
It's connected to that.

32:43.628 --> 32:47.337
- "H-F." What does that stand for?
- Hydrofluoric acid.

32:50.802 --> 32:54.590
This stuff will eat through human flesh
within seconds.

32:54.681 --> 32:58.924
- What should we do?
- Pull the lever. You want to live, don't you?

32:59.019 --> 33:02.182
What about the timer?
That has to mean something.

33:03.023 --> 33:06.060
I don't know.
I don't even know why we're here.

33:06.818 --> 33:09.230
We're here because of your father.

33:57.410 --> 33:58.650
Miss Jenkins.

33:58.745 --> 34:01.612
Please, this will only take a second.
We can help each other.

34:01.706 --> 34:03.947
What makes you think
you can just come to my door like this?

34:04.042 --> 34:07.159
Because I found something
you'll want to see.

34:08.004 --> 34:09.164
Go on.

34:13.885 --> 34:17.217
- Where'd you get this?
- It was at the location where John died.

34:17.304 --> 34:19.762
- Does it mean anything to you?
- No.

34:20.934 --> 34:22.799
Goodbye, Miss Jenkins.

34:27.649 --> 34:29.639
If you think of anything.

35:29.711 --> 35:32.043
<i>I want to thank you
for sponsoring this party, William.</i>

35:32.130 --> 35:35.247
<i>And I know
how much the clinic appreciates it.</i>

35:35.675 --> 35:38.087
- John Kramer.
- William Easton.

35:38.219 --> 35:40.710
- Kramer? You're Jill's husband, right?
- I am.

35:40.847 --> 35:43.509
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

35:43.808 --> 35:45.890
<i>Sounds like we're
in a similar business, John.</i>

35:45.977 --> 35:47.012
<i>Oh. Yeah? How's that?</i>

35:47.103 --> 35:50.391
Well, you try to predict people's behavior.
So do I.

35:51.441 --> 35:53.773
When people come to us for coverage,

35:53.860 --> 35:57.694
we have to analyze each parson
for the probability of success.

35:58.198 --> 36:00.189
- How do you do that?
- Well, it's a formula.

36:01.034 --> 36:02.649
It's pretty complicated, actually,

36:02.744 --> 36:05.201
but, in essence,
it breaks down to monthly payments

36:05.288 --> 36:08.530
multiplied by lifespan
minus the probability of illness.

36:08.625 --> 36:11.788
And if the sum is positive,
we consider coverage.

36:13.254 --> 36:17.213
- Who devised that formula?
- Me.

36:17.717 --> 36:22.302
So, in a sense,
you choose who lives or dies.

36:23.848 --> 36:27.887
No. I... No, I'd say I decide which people
have the potential

36:27.977 --> 36:30.093
to live long, healthy lives.

36:30.897 --> 36:34.890
But you're not taking into consideration
the most important human element of all.

36:34.984 --> 36:37.896
- Which is what?
- The will to live.

36:39.155 --> 36:41.646
Until a person is faced with death,

36:42.575 --> 36:46.693
it's impossible to tall
whether they have what it takes to survive.

37:39.090 --> 37:40.421
Fuck that.

37:43.762 --> 37:44.912
Shit.

38:09.454 --> 38:10.819
<i>Hello, William.</i>

38:10.914 --> 38:15.374
<i>Standing on the platforms behind me
are two of your colleagues.</i>

38:15.460 --> 38:20.295
<i>One, your file clerk, a young, healthy male
with no living relatives.</i>

38:21.049 --> 38:26.840
<i>The other, a middle-aged woman
with a family history of diabetes.</i>

38:27.514 --> 38:32.349
<i>According to your policy,
your secretary is older and weaker</i>

38:32.435 --> 38:35.518
<i>and therefore less worthy to survive.</i>

38:36.022 --> 38:39.310
<i>But you know the loss
that she will be to her family,</i>

38:39.400 --> 38:44.190
<i>while young Allen will disappear
without a blip on the world's radar.</i>

38:45.782 --> 38:50.902
<i>Only one can exit this room,
and the choice of whom falls upon you.</i>

38:52.247 --> 38:55.990
<i>You must let go of one
to save the life of the other.</i>

38:56.084 --> 38:58.621
<i>As you can see, the choice is not so clear</i>

38:58.711 --> 39:03.330
<i>when you are face to face with the people
whose blood will stain your hands.</i>

39:04.467 --> 39:06.207
<i>Let the game begin.</i>

39:09.055 --> 39:13.924
Wait! No! No, wait!
I won't do this! I won't do this!

39:23.653 --> 39:25.314
William!

39:25.405 --> 39:28.943
It's a business!
My decisions aren't made this way!

39:32.370 --> 39:34.907
No, I'm not gonna do it! I'm not gonna do it!

39:34.998 --> 39:36.909
I'm not gonna do it!

39:41.254 --> 39:43.961
- Stop!
- Please! Help me!

40:07.405 --> 40:09.441
- I'm sorry.
- No! No!

40:17.624 --> 40:18.955
I'm sorry.

40:54.994 --> 40:58.907
Thank you. Thank you!

41:04.379 --> 41:09.419
You try to find a way out of here, Addy.
I have to keep going. Be careful.

41:39.914 --> 41:42.747
What if we put acid on the metal bars?
It'll eat through the metal, won't it?

41:42.834 --> 41:46.418
Yeah, but how are we going to get it
on the bars? With our hands?

41:50.717 --> 41:52.298
What are you looking at?

41:52.844 --> 41:55.210
I wonder... The mirror.

41:57.265 --> 42:00.632
- What?
- Who's behind the glass?

42:03.688 --> 42:05.303
What do you want?

42:07.900 --> 42:09.765
Why are you doing this?

42:12.238 --> 42:15.696
Help me, please! Please, help me!

42:31.758 --> 42:35.125
<i>Hello, Pamela
You've sensationalized my life,</i>

42:35.219 --> 42:39.508
<i>twisting the truth and exploiting
my message for your own benefit.</i>

43:05.666 --> 43:07.622
- Hoffman.
- <i>It's Erickson.</i>

43:08.169 --> 43:11.536
- <i>We found the Seth Baxter tape</i>.
- Yeah?

43:12.423 --> 43:14.757
But there was something else
that we wanted to discuss with you.

43:15.343 --> 43:18.130
- What's that?
- <i>Better to talk about it in person.</i>

43:18.221 --> 43:19.961
It's time-sensitive.

43:20.973 --> 43:22.509
I'll be right there.

43:38.324 --> 43:39.474
Excuse me.

43:40.660 --> 43:42.150
- Just down there.
- Thank you.

44:04.183 --> 44:09.268
<i>The device Timothy is strapped to
is my personal favorite. I call it The Rack.</i>

44:19.407 --> 44:23.195
Last-minute tweaks?
Told you he'd fuck with it.

44:23.578 --> 44:25.114
If you switch the gear ratio,

44:25.204 --> 44:29.322
you have to change the gear grease
to match the increased friction.

44:30.543 --> 44:33.455
Maybe you should stick to the heavy lifting.

44:34.881 --> 44:36.712
You need five-weight.

44:37.300 --> 44:38.881
It's in the gun.

44:40.553 --> 44:42.509
Check with me next time.

44:42.930 --> 44:44.670
How many next times are there gonna be?

44:44.765 --> 44:47.347
However many there needs to be.

44:56.903 --> 44:58.734
That's a human being.

45:02.575 --> 45:05.157
Do you like how brutality feels, Mark?

45:05.244 --> 45:09.328
Let's be honest. You want him to suffer
just as much as I do.

45:33.606 --> 45:36.848
- So when's your test, Detective?
- I don't need one.

45:37.735 --> 45:39.316
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

45:40.071 --> 45:43.780
Because I didn't take my life for granted.

45:44.617 --> 45:47.700
You're still dragging your knuckles
on the ground.

45:47.787 --> 45:49.743
What do you know about life?

45:56.003 --> 45:59.962
Get used to me,
'cause I'm not going anywhere.

46:03.636 --> 46:05.422
You sure about that?

46:07.932 --> 46:09.422
Time is short.

46:15.314 --> 46:16.554
You okay?

46:19.944 --> 46:23.061
Now it's time to go get Dr. Denlon
from the hospital.

46:23.155 --> 46:26.568
Okay. I'll take you back.

46:53.477 --> 46:54.887
Go. Be quick.

47:05.865 --> 47:10.404
- Why'd you coma?
- John, please stop.

47:11.746 --> 47:14.032
- Don't do this.
- I promise you,

47:16.792 --> 47:18.657
when all this is done,

47:21.922 --> 47:24.288
I will provide a way out for you.

47:26.886 --> 47:28.877
I wish that time was now.

47:30.264 --> 47:32.505
Then I have something for you.

47:46.364 --> 47:47.900
What's this for?

47:51.243 --> 47:56.078
When the time's right,
you'll know what to do with it.

48:25.861 --> 48:27.011
Shit!

48:38.457 --> 48:41.449
<i>I came to talk to you, Will, because</i>

48:43.504 --> 48:47.463
I've found a treatment for my cancer
that I think holds a lot of promise.

48:47.550 --> 48:49.666
But my requests for coverage

48:51.804 --> 48:54.045
- have all been turned down.
- Yeah.

48:54.140 --> 48:56.847
So I was hoping that if I came
and explained it to you,

48:56.934 --> 49:00.301
that you might be able
to get that overturned for me.

49:03.190 --> 49:06.478
- Well, the buck stops here, John. Fire away.
- Okay.

49:09.864 --> 49:11.604
This is a doctor in Norway.

49:11.699 --> 49:16.284
He's got a 30 to 40% success rate
with gene therapy.

49:16.370 --> 49:21.740
He injects what he calls suicide genes
into cancerous tumor cells.

49:21.834 --> 49:25.167
Then an inactive form of a toxic drug
is administered...

49:25.254 --> 49:28.496
Yes. I'm familiar with the therapy
you're talking about.

49:28.591 --> 49:31.628
Right. And a new trial's starting.

49:31.719 --> 49:33.255
He's looking for new patients,

49:33.345 --> 49:35.461
and he seems to think
that I'm the perfect candidate.

49:35.556 --> 49:39.549
John, if your primary physician, Dr. Gordon,
thought you were a suitable candidate,

49:39.643 --> 49:42.055
- he would have pursued it.
- No.

49:42.146 --> 49:45.559
Dr. Gordon is a specialist. You know,
he's making money on his specialty.

49:45.649 --> 49:47.264
He's not a thinker.

49:47.359 --> 49:50.396
I mean, the man has his hand
on the doorknob half the time that I'm there.

49:50.488 --> 49:54.106
I'm gonna be straight with you. At your age
and with the development of your cancer,

49:54.200 --> 49:55.940
it's simply not feasible
for Umbrella Health.

49:56.035 --> 49:58.947
Wait, wait, wait, wait. What's not feasible?

49:59.038 --> 50:02.906
By whose mathematical equation
is this not feasible?

50:03.000 --> 50:05.958
It's policy, John. It's policy.

50:07.213 --> 50:09.704
And if you go outside the system
and seek out this treatment,

50:09.798 --> 50:13.757
which has been deemed ineffective,
you will be in breach of policy

50:13.844 --> 50:16.586
and you will be dropped
from coverage completely.

50:17.389 --> 50:18.720
I'm sorry.

50:30.027 --> 50:31.892
Did you know that in the Far East,

50:31.987 --> 50:34.729
people pay their doctors
when they're healthy?

50:35.699 --> 50:38.736
When they're sick,
they don't have to pay them.

50:39.703 --> 50:43.366
So, basically,
they end up paying for what they want,

50:43.457 --> 50:45.448
not what they don't want.

50:47.002 --> 50:49.414
We got it all ass-backwards here.

50:51.549 --> 50:55.838
These politicians, they say the same thing
over and over and over again.

50:55.928 --> 50:59.887
"Healthcare decisions should be made
by doctors and their patients,

50:59.974 --> 51:01.180
"not by the government."

51:01.267 --> 51:04.805
Well, now I know they're not made
by doctors and their patients

51:04.895 --> 51:06.681
or by the government.

51:08.065 --> 51:11.148
They're made
by the fucking insurance companies.

51:12.611 --> 51:13.851
Piranha.

51:15.573 --> 51:21.284
John, please.
If you do this, you'll be on your own,

51:21.370 --> 51:23.656
and the subsequent cost to you
will be staggering.

51:23.747 --> 51:27.160
Don't talk to me about money.
I have money.

51:28.752 --> 51:30.708
This is about principle.

51:34.758 --> 51:39.218
You see, Will,
this is my life we're talking about.

51:39.513 --> 51:41.469
- You remember?
- What about Jill's life?

51:41.557 --> 51:43.047
How's she going to be taken
care of when you're gone?

51:43.142 --> 51:45.133
Let me worry about Jill.

51:45.644 --> 51:49.512
The type of cancer you have
is malignant and inoperable.

51:49.607 --> 51:51.472
That rolled off your tongue real smooth.

51:51.567 --> 51:54.525
Even if the treatment works,
the cancer will return eventually.

51:54.612 --> 51:58.070
- It's an unwinnable battle.
- That was even smoother.

51:58.157 --> 52:01.149
As a matter of fact,
that was downright slick.

52:02.703 --> 52:06.992
You think it's the living
who will have ultimate judgment over you,

52:07.082 --> 52:10.620
because the dead will have no claim
over your soul,

52:21.055 --> 52:23.011
but you may be mistaken.

52:38.614 --> 52:40.070
Oh, shit!

52:48.290 --> 52:52.533
<i>Hello, William.
You have seen the flaws in your policy.</i>

52:52.628 --> 52:56.337
<i>But what you have not seen
is the extent some people will go to</i>

52:56.423 --> 52:58.288
<i>when faced with death.</i>

53:01.053 --> 53:03.419
<i>The lawyer from your firm has...</i>

53:03.514 --> 53:05.926
- Debbie!
<i>- ...90 seconds to cross this room</i>

53:06.016 --> 53:10.259
<i>or the device attached to her chest
will discharge and pierce her brain.</i>

53:10.354 --> 53:13.061
It's gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay.

53:13.148 --> 53:17.391
<i>She will find that the journey
across this room is filled with danger.</i>

53:18.237 --> 53:22.856
<i>In order for her to make it,
you will need to be there for her,</i>

53:22.950 --> 53:27.535
<i>and it is you who ultimately holds the key
to her survival.</i>

53:29.206 --> 53:32.744
<i>When faced with death,
will she have the skills to live?</i>

53:33.502 --> 53:35.242
<i>Let the game begin.</i>

53:37.339 --> 53:39.830
Okay. Okay, listen!

53:39.925 --> 53:42.632
- Jesus Christ! What the fuck is this?
- Debbie! Debbie! Listen to me!

53:42.720 --> 53:45.712
- Debbie! Okay, Debbie, listen to me! Debbie!
- What is this?

53:46.807 --> 53:48.162
- Get me the fuck out of here!
- Get through the maze...

53:48.262 --> 53:49.949
as fast as you can.
Listen to me!

53:50.018 --> 53:51.974
- Get me out of here!
- Debbie!

53:52.062 --> 53:55.349
Okay. You've got to get through this
maze as fast as you can!

53:55.449 --> 53:57.673
Go! Move now! Go now!

54:00.112 --> 54:04.651
Come on! You can make it! You can make it!
You got to keep moving! Go!

54:04.742 --> 54:08.701
- Will, this is insane! I can't!
- Go! You can make it!

54:08.787 --> 54:11.950
Come on! You can make it!
You've got to keep moving!

54:17.254 --> 54:19.916
Wait a minute!
I think I can help you up here!

54:20.007 --> 54:21.963
Maybe this will stop it!

54:25.137 --> 54:27.253
Yes! Yes!

54:27.681 --> 54:30.047
Do it again! It worked! It worked!

54:30.142 --> 54:33.259
- Do it again! It worked, it worked, it worked!
- Okay! Ready?

54:33.353 --> 54:35.435
- Yes!
- Go!

54:51.538 --> 54:55.998
Keep moving! Don't stop!
Keep going! Keep going! Keep going!

54:57.085 --> 54:58.450
Don't stop!

55:00.422 --> 55:04.006
You gotta keep going! Keep going! Go! Go!

55:04.843 --> 55:08.006
Keep moving! Go! Go! Go!

55:10.349 --> 55:13.841
Fuck, I can't! It's a fucking trap!
There's no way out!

55:15.813 --> 55:18.020
It's a fucking trap! I can't!

55:20.692 --> 55:26.187
No! No, there's a ladder at the end!
So just go under! I'll help you!

55:28.492 --> 55:29.652
Ready?

55:32.162 --> 55:33.312
Go!

55:52.808 --> 55:58.098
God! Come on, Debbie, go! Climb! Climb!

55:59.189 --> 56:02.898
Come on! Come on, you're almost there!
You're almost there!

56:04.862 --> 56:06.227
Go! Go! Go!

56:07.406 --> 56:11.820
Okay, look for a key.
There's got to be a key! Look for a key!

56:14.496 --> 56:15.702
What?

56:17.624 --> 56:19.489
What are you waiting for?

56:19.585 --> 56:21.792
- It's in you.
- What?

56:21.879 --> 56:24.996
- It's fucking inside you!
- Oh, fuck!

56:26.383 --> 56:32.253
Okay. Okay, I can do this. Wait!

56:32.973 --> 56:36.431
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I need that fucking key!

56:55.495 --> 56:58.612
I can get it! I can get it! I can get it!

57:01.960 --> 57:05.452
God! No! God! No!

57:31.698 --> 57:33.188
<i>Hello, Pamela.</i>

57:35.160 --> 57:39.369
<i>Well, today you will experience
the meaning of sacrifice.</i>

57:39.456 --> 57:44.075
<i>And you will see the consequence
for those who unjustly hurt others.</i>

57:44.169 --> 57:45.375
Fuck!

58:06.525 --> 58:09.107
Someone's there. They're watching us.

58:09.736 --> 58:13.354
Why? Why would someone do this?

58:13.448 --> 58:15.313
To see how we respond.

58:16.326 --> 58:19.159
They want to know
what decision we'll make.

58:20.080 --> 58:24.494
- Let's pull it.
- No! We don't know what it does yet.

58:24.584 --> 58:26.120
It's too risky.

58:29.715 --> 58:30.875
Fuck!

58:37.305 --> 58:38.455
Hey.

58:38.682 --> 58:41.264
- Thanks for coming in.
- What'd you find?

58:41.351 --> 58:43.558
- An abnormality in Strahm's fingerprint.
- What?

58:43.645 --> 58:45.010
Take a look.

58:47.482 --> 58:49.643
So the human fingerprint leaves
an oily residue,

58:49.735 --> 58:52.021
and depending on how long
it's been exposed to the elements,

58:52.112 --> 58:55.024
- it's highly susceptible to contamination.
- So what's the problem?

58:55.115 --> 58:58.448
Well, we found trace amounts
of halo-methane R-12.

58:58.535 --> 59:00.491
She means Freon.

59:00.579 --> 59:02.945
Production of R-12 ceased in 1994.

59:03.040 --> 59:06.703
So the question is, was the contaminant
we found at the site already

59:06.793 --> 59:08.624
or did Strahm bring it in with him?

59:08.712 --> 59:10.498
Yeah. We're looking
into the building's function

59:10.589 --> 59:12.545
before it was abandoned.

59:13.884 --> 59:15.215
Excuse me.

59:16.428 --> 59:19.215
Did anything coma
from the Seth Baxter tape?

59:19.306 --> 59:22.389
Yeah, actually,
we might be on to something.

59:22.476 --> 59:24.182
The tape was in pretty rough shape
when we found it,

59:24.269 --> 59:25.884
but we were able to authenticate it.

59:25.979 --> 59:30.439
The voice was intentionally distorted,
but it didn't match John Kramer's.

59:30.525 --> 59:33.642
- It's currently being analyzed.
- For what?

59:33.737 --> 59:37.776
Well, we're trying to descramble the tape
to find the original voice.

59:37.866 --> 59:40.198
He's on with the tech right now.

59:42.662 --> 59:45.278
Are you timing something? Your watch.

59:46.875 --> 59:49.366
I was before I got your call, yeah.

59:51.004 --> 59:53.962
We got it. This is our smoking gun.

59:55.467 --> 59:57.958
The lab's off-site. Coma on.

59:59.346 --> 01:00:02.634
- You're coming, right?
- Of course.

01:00:38.009 --> 01:00:41.172
<i>You shut up! All you do
is try to take over every situation.</i>

01:00:41.304 --> 01:00:42.589
<i>You don't know what the fuck
you're talking about!</i>

01:00:42.681 --> 01:00:44.171
<i>Shut the fuck up!</i>

01:00:44.266 --> 01:00:47.599
<i>- Fuck off!
- Would you two just shut up already!</i>

01:00:47.686 --> 01:00:48.971
<i>We can figure this out.</i>

01:00:49.062 --> 01:00:52.554
- Hey! Who's in there?
- Mr. Easton? Is that you?

01:00:52.649 --> 01:00:55.766
- Yeah. Shelby? Who's in there with you?
- Mr. Easton!

01:00:55.861 --> 01:00:58.523
We're all in here, sir. All six of us.
What the hell is going on?

01:00:58.613 --> 01:01:00.103
Everybody! We need your help.

01:01:00.198 --> 01:01:01.779
What can you see?

01:01:01.867 --> 01:01:04.529
We can't see anything. It's pitch dark.

01:01:05.328 --> 01:01:08.445
- What's that sound?
- I don't know, something we're chained to.

01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:11.452
- It's spinning. Oh, God.
- Get us out of here!

01:01:12.210 --> 01:01:14.041
- You have to help us!
- Please!

01:01:14.629 --> 01:01:17.166
Come on, get us out of here, Mr. E!

01:01:24.306 --> 01:01:26.092
Mr. Easton!

01:01:26.183 --> 01:01:29.471
Mr. Easton! You got to get us out of here!

01:01:29.561 --> 01:01:30.892
Oh, my God!

01:01:32.606 --> 01:01:34.346
Pull it together, Mr. Easton. Come on!

01:01:34.441 --> 01:01:36.102
- You can do it!
- You can do it!

01:01:36.193 --> 01:01:38.184
Mr. Easton! Mr. Easton!

01:01:38.278 --> 01:01:40.985
Please! Please get us out of here! Please!

01:01:41.072 --> 01:01:43.063
Mr. Easton, what is this?

01:01:45.577 --> 01:01:46.942
It's a game.

01:01:47.579 --> 01:01:49.240
- Game?
- Mr. Easton?

01:01:59.424 --> 01:02:04.635
<i>Hello, William Before you are six
of your most valuable associates,</i>

01:02:04.721 --> 01:02:07.633
<i>the ones who find errors in policies.</i>

01:02:07.724 --> 01:02:10.386
<i>Their findings result in over two-thirds</i>

01:02:10.477 --> 01:02:14.516
<i>of all applications denied
or prematurely terminated.</i>

01:02:14.606 --> 01:02:20.101
<i>Now you must apply your analysis to them.
And will you be able to find their errors?</i>

01:02:21.446 --> 01:02:23.311
<i>Six ride the carousel.</i>

01:02:26.701 --> 01:02:28.942
<i>But only two can get off.</i>

01:02:29.704 --> 01:02:33.572
<i>The decision of which two survive
falls upon you.</i>

01:02:33.667 --> 01:02:37.580
<i>But remember,
the mounted gun will continue to fire</i>

01:02:37.671 --> 01:02:39.957
<i>until all six rounds are spent.</i>

01:02:40.757 --> 01:02:44.921
<i>And if no decision is made on your part,
all six will perish.</i>

01:02:45.595 --> 01:02:46.745
What? What?

01:02:46.805 --> 01:02:48.796
<i>To offer the two reprieves,</i>

01:02:48.890 --> 01:02:53.384
<i>you must press both buttons at once
in the box before you.</i>

01:02:53.478 --> 01:02:57.847
<i>However, in doing so
you'll give a sacrifice of your own.</i>

01:02:57.941 --> 01:03:00.774
<i>Two can live, four will die.</i>

01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:05.149
<i>Your decision's symbolized
by the blood on your hands.</i>

01:03:10.412 --> 01:03:13.870
Mr. Easton, wake up!
You gotta get us out of here!

01:03:14.833 --> 01:03:16.164
- Pick me!
- Mr. Easton, come on!

01:03:16.251 --> 01:03:19.869
Listen to me.
Mr. Easton, I am the one who should live.

01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:22.166
- Do something!
- Fuck.

01:03:25.802 --> 01:03:27.258
Jesus Christ!

01:03:28.263 --> 01:03:32.097
Please, Mr. Easton! Mr. Easton! Please!

01:03:32.183 --> 01:03:35.220
Follow the policy, Mr. Easton. Do it!

01:03:35.312 --> 01:03:39.897
Please! Mr. Easton, follow the policy!
Follow the policy!

01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:45.981
- Holy shit!
- Oh, my God!

01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:49.401
- No!
- Oh, my God!

01:03:49.492 --> 01:03:50.982
What the fuck!

01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:53.326
- What the fuck!
- No!

01:03:55.999 --> 01:03:59.082
Mr. E! They say we're only as strong
as the weakest link!

01:03:59.169 --> 01:04:01.410
I'm the strongest! You can't let me die!

01:04:01.504 --> 01:04:04.792
Fuck him!
I'm healthy, sir. I'm healthy! Please!

01:04:04.883 --> 01:04:06.794
Mr. Easton, come on!

01:04:06.885 --> 01:04:10.503
No, I have two kids.
You know them well. Please!

01:04:10.597 --> 01:04:14.215
Please, they can't grow up without ma!
They need me!

01:04:20.357 --> 01:04:21.893
Oh, shit!

01:04:35.372 --> 01:04:37.579
Thank you! Thank you!

01:04:37.665 --> 01:04:40.156
- Fucking hell!
- Thank you.

01:04:40.251 --> 01:04:43.243
Fuck her!
You don't even know her, Mr. Easton.

01:04:44.381 --> 01:04:46.963
Listen to me, okay?
My parents are sick, okay?

01:04:47.050 --> 01:04:49.310
- They need me. I'm all they have, please!
- You fucking liar!

01:04:49.344 --> 01:04:51.676
- Your parents hate you! They cut you off!
- What?

01:04:51.763 --> 01:04:54.926
- Shut up! That's not true!
- Fuck you, it is true. I sit next to you!

01:04:55.016 --> 01:04:58.850
- I... I'm pregnant. I'm pregnant!
- No, she's not! She's lying!

01:04:58.937 --> 01:05:00.552
- She's fucking lying!
- Fuck you!

01:05:00.647 --> 01:05:02.512
- Mr. Easton, she is lying!
- I'm pregnant!

01:05:02.607 --> 01:05:05.189
- She's lying.
- No! No, fuck!

01:05:05.276 --> 01:05:06.766
- I'm pregnant!
- She's fucking lying!

01:05:06.861 --> 01:05:10.445
He's lying, Mr. Easton, it's not true!
Please! Please!

01:05:10.949 --> 01:05:13.691
Fuck! Push the thing! Push the thing!

01:05:13.785 --> 01:05:15.901
- She's lying.
- No!

01:05:15.995 --> 01:05:19.283
- Mr. Easton, push it! Push the thing!
- Oh, God! No!

01:05:21.751 --> 01:05:22.957
Push it!

01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:26.912
Oh, God! What the...

01:05:28.842 --> 01:05:30.332
What the fuck!

01:05:31.469 --> 01:05:34.051
You have to trust me! I won't lie to you!

01:05:34.139 --> 01:05:37.597
- Oh, please! He's a kiss-ass!
- Mr. Easton! My parents are loaded!

01:05:37.684 --> 01:05:39.351
- Oh, God!
- They'll give you whatever you want!

01:05:39.394 --> 01:05:40.617
- Just say a number!
- He's a thief!

01:05:40.687 --> 01:05:42.643
He's been stealing from the company
for years!

01:05:42.730 --> 01:05:46.348
It's true! It's true! It's true! It's true!

01:05:46.443 --> 01:05:48.149
- Thief!
- Fuck you!

01:05:48.236 --> 01:05:50.568
- It's true! He has been...
- Don't listen to them!

01:05:50.655 --> 01:05:53.488
- Don't listen to them, Mr. E!
- It's true!

01:05:53.575 --> 01:05:58.114
Christ! Mr. Easton, come on! Mr. Easton...

01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:10.914
Okay, Mr. Easton, listen to me carefully.
I'm on your side, and I can help you.

01:06:11.718 --> 01:06:16.428
- But you cannot trust this bitch!
- What? Fuck you!

01:06:16.514 --> 01:06:18.379
- She's a fucking liar!
- What?

01:06:18.475 --> 01:06:22.093
You cannot believe her.
She has already tried to lie!

01:06:22.187 --> 01:06:26.146
And she's just going to continue to do it!
You know it!

01:06:26.232 --> 01:06:27.642
It's me, Josh!

01:06:27.734 --> 01:06:32.068
No, I haven't! What about you?
He wants to be you! Okay, you know that!

01:06:32.155 --> 01:06:35.613
But he'll slit your throat
at the first opportunity!

01:06:38.036 --> 01:06:41.949
Please don't let me die! Please! No, please!

01:06:47.629 --> 01:06:51.292
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, fuck!

01:06:58.181 --> 01:06:59.717
Oh, God!

01:07:03.353 --> 01:07:04.684
Thank you!

01:07:07.941 --> 01:07:11.308
Oh, well, that's it, isn't it? It's over!

01:07:11.653 --> 01:07:14.816
- You mother fucker!
- Stop it!

01:07:14.906 --> 01:07:19.570
You spineless,
pussy-whipped motherfucker!

01:07:20.411 --> 01:07:24.745
That's all it takes, eh?
A bitch says one thing and it's all over!

01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:30.415
You know what, William?
Your policy, it's bullshit!

01:07:30.838 --> 01:07:32.794
Fucking bullshit!

01:07:33.591 --> 01:07:36.424
Well, you listen to me, you son of a bitch!

01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:38.961
I did everything for you.

01:07:44.352 --> 01:07:48.265
Look at me!
When you're killing me, you look at me!

01:08:00.785 --> 01:08:02.116
Thank you.

01:08:04.330 --> 01:08:05.911
Oh, my God!

01:08:06.916 --> 01:08:09.703
- Thank you.
- Emily.

01:08:32.774 --> 01:08:35.265
<i>Right now, you're feeling helpless.</i>

01:08:36.529 --> 01:08:39.145
<i>Right now, you're feeling helpless.</i>

01:08:40.283 --> 01:08:42.694
<i>Right now, you're feeling helpless.</i>

01:08:44.453 --> 01:08:47.036
<i>Right now, you're feeling helpless.</i>

01:08:49.167 --> 01:08:51.578
- How's it going?
- Good.

01:08:53.504 --> 01:08:54.835
This is it.

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:57.087
Whoever made this tape had access

01:08:57.175 --> 01:08:59.837
to some very impressive
audio-filtration equipment.

01:08:59.926 --> 01:09:02.634
<i>Right now, you're feeling helpless.</i>

01:09:02.721 --> 01:09:05.634
Fortunately, we have some tricks
of our own here.

01:09:05.725 --> 01:09:10.594
We can turn his algorithm upside down
and let us hear what he really sounds like.

01:09:13.107 --> 01:09:15.018
Let's hear what you got.

01:09:17.278 --> 01:09:20.441
<i>Right now, you're feeling helpless.</i>

01:09:21.658 --> 01:09:22.898
You okay?

01:09:24.368 --> 01:09:26.859
You seem a little preoccupied.

01:09:26.953 --> 01:09:29.286
I'm just anxious about the tape.

01:09:31.751 --> 01:09:34.242
<i>Right now, you're feeling helpless.</i>

01:09:36.897 --> 01:09:42.296
You know, there are still a couple of things
I can't quite wrap my head around.

01:09:42.386 --> 01:09:45.379
Like, I don't understand
Strahm's motivation.

01:09:46.307 --> 01:09:48.046
He was my partner for five years.

01:09:48.142 --> 01:09:50.349
I mean,
we all knew he was a bit of a hothead.

01:09:50.435 --> 01:09:53.894
But I never saw any indication
of psychotic behavior.

01:09:53.981 --> 01:09:57.940
You never can really tell
what someone's thinking on the inside.

01:10:01.114 --> 01:10:02.524
<i>...helpless.</i>

01:10:03.324 --> 01:10:06.157
- Hear that?
- <i>Right now, you're feeling helpless.</i>

01:10:06.244 --> 01:10:07.529
We're getting there.

01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:10.157
Come on,
I thought you had something to show us.

01:10:10.248 --> 01:10:13.285
Yeah, it's just I never really thought of him
as being vengeful.

01:10:13.376 --> 01:10:18.211
- <i>Right now, you're feeling helpless.</i>
- You know? I mean, all the facts are there.

01:10:22.135 --> 01:10:25.627
- But something doesn't sit right.
- Listen. It's getting closer.

01:10:25.722 --> 01:10:29.089
- <i>Right now, you're feeling...</i>
- You know, there is an alternative.

01:10:29.183 --> 01:10:32.175
Let's say that Strahm killed Seth Baxter

01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:36.229
specifically to set you up as an accomplice
to Jigsaw.

01:10:36.315 --> 01:10:37.465
Okay.

01:10:38.693 --> 01:10:41.059
Well, there's a problem with that, though.

01:10:41.154 --> 01:10:43.145
On further analysis of Strahm's fingerprints,

01:10:43.239 --> 01:10:46.697
it was found that the uric acid levels
in the eccrine gland residue

01:10:46.784 --> 01:10:52.324
were inconsistent for an individual
with an active epidermal metabolism.

01:10:52.415 --> 01:10:53.951
In other words?

01:10:54.292 --> 01:10:57.159
In other words, when he left his fingerprints
on the latest victim,

01:10:57.253 --> 01:10:58.584
Strahm was already dead.

01:10:58.671 --> 01:11:01.333
- <i>Right now, you're feeling helpless.</i>
- There it is.

01:11:01.424 --> 01:11:03.915
<i>Right now, you're feeling helpless.</i>

01:11:28.159 --> 01:11:30.115
Who else knows about me?

01:11:31.704 --> 01:11:34.036
Who else fucking knows about me?

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:40.744
- Everyone.
- You lie. You're fucking lying.

01:14:27.755 --> 01:14:29.461
I found something you'll want to see.

01:14:29.548 --> 01:14:31.459
It was at the location where John died.

01:14:31.550 --> 01:14:32.700
Does it mean anything to you?

01:14:38.015 --> 01:14:39.104
What are you doing?

01:14:39.105 --> 01:14:41.557
Get as far away from the sprinkler head
as possible.

01:14:41.644 --> 01:14:42.850
We don't know what it does!

01:14:42.937 --> 01:14:44.643
I'm not gonna just sit here and do nothing.

01:14:44.730 --> 01:14:47.893
We need to make a decision!
Don't you understand?

01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:14.249
Okay. You can pull it. I love you.

01:15:14.885 --> 01:15:18.127
I love you, too. Get back.

01:15:22.101 --> 01:15:24.387
No. You don't know what it does!

01:15:35.573 --> 01:15:38.360
- On three, I'll pull it.
- Okay.

01:15:39.535 --> 01:15:40.741
No. No.

01:15:43.330 --> 01:15:44.480
One,

01:15:45.958 --> 01:15:47.108
two,

01:15:48.919 --> 01:15:50.079
three!

01:15:52.048 --> 01:15:53.538
What the fuck?

01:15:56.427 --> 01:16:00.636
It doesn't even work!
It doesn't even fucking work!

01:16:00.723 --> 01:16:02.213
What the fuck?

01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:08.977
It doesn't make any fucking sense.

01:16:19.742 --> 01:16:21.858
I think I know what it does.

01:16:37.176 --> 01:16:40.168
Get used to me,
'cause I'm not going anywhere.

01:16:40.262 --> 01:16:42.002
You sure about that?

01:16:47.686 --> 01:16:48.846
Amanda will fail you.

01:16:50.773 --> 01:16:51.923
We'll see.

01:17:01.784 --> 01:17:06.824
<i>"Amanda, you were with Cecil
the night Jill lost Gideon."</i>

01:17:09.291 --> 01:17:10.441
Go.

01:17:13.337 --> 01:17:14.548
What the fuck are you doing?
Go. Go.

01:17:14.574 --> 01:17:16.584
- I don't know about this.
- What do you mean, you don't know?

01:17:16.610 --> 01:17:18.501
- She's been good to us.
- I've been good to you.

01:17:18.592 --> 01:17:21.550
- I know...
- Please, please, go.

01:17:21.971 --> 01:17:23.177
You drive me crazy.

01:17:23.264 --> 01:17:26.552
Go on, you fucking pussy! Go! Go! Go!

01:17:28.561 --> 01:17:30.927
- Cecil! No!
- Listen to me!

01:17:41.866 --> 01:17:43.151
<i>"You killed their child.</i>

01:17:45.035 --> 01:17:48.994
<i>"You know it and I know it,
so do exactly as I say.</i>

01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:53.874
<i>"Kill Lynn Denlon
or I will tell John what you did."</i>

01:17:55.421 --> 01:17:57.127
She doesn't deserve to go free!

01:17:57.214 --> 01:18:00.297
Amanda, Lynn is more important
then you know.

01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:05.920
Lynn!

01:18:41.967 --> 01:18:46.927
I made it. I made it. I made it!

01:18:47.681 --> 01:18:50.923
<i>If you fall,
you will never see your family again.</i>

01:18:57.691 --> 01:18:59.977
- What are you doing here?
- Will!

01:19:01.111 --> 01:19:03.568
- Pamela!
- Yeah.

01:19:03.948 --> 01:19:07.065
I know it's your birthday.
I'm going to make it up to you, I promise.

01:19:07.243 --> 01:19:11.282
Are you really standing up your sister
for work? I'm your only family.

01:19:11.455 --> 01:19:13.491
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

01:19:14.917 --> 01:19:17.454
Let her go! I mean it! I won!

01:19:18.212 --> 01:19:21.750
I followed your fucking rules!
Now you let her go!

01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:23.956
You son of a bitch!

01:19:24.635 --> 01:19:27.502
<i>You've just given me a death sentence.
I mean, who's going to cover me now?</i>

01:19:28.180 --> 01:19:29.920
You just killed me.

01:19:30.182 --> 01:19:31.888
Come on, let's go.

01:19:37.815 --> 01:19:40.272
You're the man that killed my dad.

01:20:01.347 --> 01:20:02.548
<i>Hello, Tara.</i>

01:20:02.648 --> 01:20:06.908
<i>My apologies for exposing you
and your son to this kind of treatment.</i>

01:20:07.177 --> 01:20:10.635
<i>But I can assure you,
it is not without reason.</i>

01:20:10.723 --> 01:20:15.843
<i>The man before you just made the sacrifices
to save the life of a loved one.</i>

01:20:16.145 --> 01:20:20.058
<i>However, when given the opportunity
to save your husband's life,</i>

01:20:20.524 --> 01:20:22.355
<i>he chose not to.</i>

01:20:22.484 --> 01:20:26.523
<i>Now you will be given the power
to save a life.</i>

01:20:26.613 --> 01:20:30.447
<i>Will you grant this man the opportunity
to continue living?</i>

01:20:30.534 --> 01:20:33.025
<i>Or will you dispense
the same death sentence</i>

01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:34.906
<i>he issued your husband?</i>

01:20:34.997 --> 01:20:36.362
<i>Live or die.</i>

01:20:37.708 --> 01:20:39.494
<i>The choice Is yours.</i>

01:20:45.382 --> 01:20:47.043
It's not my game.

01:20:54.183 --> 01:20:59.553
<i>I'm leaving you a box today,
and its contents are of grave importance.</i>

01:21:02.483 --> 01:21:04.644
Miss Tuck, what's in the box?

01:21:28.425 --> 01:21:31.758
Please. Please forgive me.

01:21:32.554 --> 01:21:34.419
Have mercy, please!

01:21:34.515 --> 01:21:38.099
Did he show mercy
when my husband was suffering?

01:21:44.358 --> 01:21:46.565
John left you five envelopes.

01:21:47.569 --> 01:21:49.560
The sixth one was for me.

01:21:54.785 --> 01:21:56.571
This is John's will.

01:22:00.332 --> 01:22:02.197
<i>...to watch this horror!</i>

01:22:02.292 --> 01:22:05.625
- He had no choice!
- He always had a choice!

01:22:07.548 --> 01:22:11.712
The reason I am doing this
isn't because I can't forgive you

01:22:11.802 --> 01:22:13.793
for what you did to me.

01:22:15.472 --> 01:22:17.713
The reason I'm doing this

01:22:17.808 --> 01:22:21.972
is because I couldn't forgive myself
for what you might do to someone else.

01:22:22.104 --> 01:22:24.390
Please, no. Please.

01:22:25.691 --> 01:22:28.228
- You will never kill again.
- Please.

01:22:30.821 --> 01:22:31.981
Please.

01:22:34.908 --> 01:22:36.114
Please.

01:22:37.035 --> 01:22:38.241
Please.

01:22:39.872 --> 01:22:41.703
Please. Please.

01:22:42.416 --> 01:22:44.873
I can't. I can't kill him.

01:22:50.174 --> 01:22:51.505
But I can.

01:22:52.342 --> 01:22:55.675
- No, Brant!
- You killed my father, you motherfucker!

01:23:00.517 --> 01:23:02.303
Now you burn in hell.

01:23:30.797 --> 01:23:32.128
Game over.

01:23:40.265 --> 01:23:41.630
- John Kramer.
- William Easton.

01:23:41.725 --> 01:23:42.875
Nice to meet you.

01:23:51.902 --> 01:23:54.860
- Those are the rules, Harold.
- You've just given me a death sentence.

01:23:54.947 --> 01:23:58.235
So, in a sense,
you choose who lives or dies.

01:24:04.915 --> 01:24:06.155
No!

01:24:06.625 --> 01:24:09.162
It's policy, John. It's policy.

01:24:15.175 --> 01:24:19.794
You think it's the living
who will have ultimate judgment over you,

01:24:19.888 --> 01:24:23.130
<i>because the dead will have no claim
over your soul,</i>

01:24:27.062 --> 01:24:29.018
but you may be mistaken.

01:24:39.366 --> 01:24:40.947
So when's your test, Detective?

01:24:43.912 --> 01:24:46.028
- I don't need one.
- Oh, yeah?

01:24:54.214 --> 01:24:56.330
<i>You know why you're here, don't you?</i>

01:25:01.096 --> 01:25:04.088
I want to know
if you have what it takes to survive.

01:25:05.017 --> 01:25:07.599
<i>You feel you now have control, don't you?</i>

01:25:07.686 --> 01:25:10.723
<i>You think you will walk away untested.</i>

01:25:25.621 --> 01:25:28.237
Do you like how brutality feels, Mark?

01:25:30.167 --> 01:25:32.328
I'm only carrying out John's final request.

01:25:32.919 --> 01:25:35.251
You want a chance? I'll give you a chance.

01:31:12.926 --> 01:31:14.211
Remember...

01:31:15.261 --> 01:31:16.626
Remember...

01:31:19.307 --> 01:31:25.348
Remember, don't trust
the one who saves you.

01:31:27.857 --> 01:31:30.314
Don't trust the one who saves you.
