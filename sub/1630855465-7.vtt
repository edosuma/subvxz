[engines firing up]

00:38.121 --> 00:39.706
It better work!

00:44.127 --> 00:45.420
Remarkable!

00:45.503 --> 00:48.256
I knew there was the potential
for space between worlds,

00:48.339 --> 00:50.759
but I never imagined
it would be quite like this.

00:50.842 --> 00:51.760

there's some solid land in there.

03:50.521 --> 03:52.273
I hate this place!

03:53.608 --> 03:55.235
Destroy them!

04:02.867 --> 04:05.078
Thanks for stopping by.

04:06.371 --> 04:09.916
I've locked the Chaos Council
out of the system, but it won't last long.

04:09.999 --> 04:11.876
Don't tell me we're trapped in here?

04:11.960 --> 04:14.712
Are you kidding?
This is all going according to my plan.

That? No.

[Dr. Babble babbles]

04:34.232 --> 04:37.277
Stop! The Council thinks
we're going down...

but we are taking a different path.

04:43.199 --> 04:45.159
Oh, things are finally coming together.

We've got the Shards.
We can finally fix everything!

04:47.912 --> 04:49.831
It's going to be perfect!

04:50.957 --> 04:52.083
[all] Ha!

04:53.668 --> 04:54.544
[all] Huh?

04:56.879 --> 04:58.965
Where did they go? [screams]

04:59.048 --> 05:00.550
The Shards are gone!

All of your faults!

are you doing out there!

05:05.763 --> 05:09.183
Quiet, all of you!
We have one simple goal...

05:09.267 --> 05:10.768
Get the Shards back!

Where are they?

05:16.399 --> 05:19.610
Uh... it looks like
they're headed down to the street.

05:19.694 --> 05:22.030
Divert all the Eggforcers
back to the Yoke.

05:22.113 --> 05:24.824
We'll crush them the moment
they step outside!

05:32.290 --> 05:34.917
Why aren't they powering down?
We have the Shards.

05:35.001 --> 05:37.670
Residual prism energy
stored in the Mothership.

05:37.754 --> 05:39.756

[electricity crackles]

05:57.690 --> 05:59.942
Nine, you are full of surprises.

06:00.026 --> 06:01.736

06:01.819 --> 06:04.614
wait 'til you see
what I've got going on in the Grim.

06:04.697 --> 06:06.991
Grim? Cool, can't wait to hear more!

06:07.075 --> 06:09.118
But right now we gotta get to Ghost Hill.

06:09.202 --> 06:10.203
Ghost Hill?

06:10.286 --> 06:12.622
[Sonic] Yeah! It's just like
the real deal,

06:12.705 --> 06:15.833
plus it's got a fourth Shard
and this blueprint "thingy."

06:15.917 --> 06:17.168
Blueprint?

06:19.796 --> 06:22.590
That's the key to putting
the prism back together!

06:22.673 --> 06:23.758
Exactly!

06:24.342 --> 06:27.261
-How do we get to this Ghost Hill?
-[thudding on door]

06:31.099 --> 06:33.768

you get the Shards out of here!

06:56.624 --> 06:57.750

06:58.376 --> 07:00.628
What was that about,
heading to the street?

07:00.711 --> 07:02.797
[mockingly] What was that about,
heading to the street?

07:02.880 --> 07:03.965
That's what you sound like.

07:04.048 --> 07:05.133

[Knuckles] Argh!

07:25.736 --> 07:27.989
Me beauty.

07:29.657 --> 07:32.285
The portal shouldn't have been
left open this long.

07:32.702 --> 07:33.953
They're decaying.

07:34.036 --> 07:35.788
Do you think we can go
through them?

07:35.872 --> 07:39.667
-I don't trust them, they look unstable.
-[warning beeps]

07:43.504 --> 07:45.423

and you get blasted!

08:00.229 --> 08:01.439
Whoo-hoo!

08:01.522 --> 08:03.191
That was epic!

08:04.150 --> 08:05.693
Yes, it was.

[beeping]

08:10.740 --> 08:11.908
[Sonic] Ha, ha, ha!

08:11.991 --> 08:14.202
Nothing's gonna stop us now!

08:17.497 --> 08:19.123
Whoa!

08:20.791 --> 08:23.294
Will you stop saying stuff like that?

08:23.794 --> 08:25.838
[Dr. Deep] No matter how fast you are,

08:25.922 --> 08:28.257
time always catches up.

08:28.341 --> 08:31.427
Time, and the Chaos Council--

08:31.511 --> 08:33.846
Will you just blast them already?

08:33.930 --> 08:35.223
[beeping]

08:37.850 --> 08:40.353
Ugh. We're going down!

08:45.274 --> 08:46.317
The Shards.

08:49.278 --> 08:51.280
-[Shattercraft powering down]
-You okay?

08:51.364 --> 08:52.740
The Shatterdrive is down.

08:52.823 --> 08:54.242
Go get the Shards!

08:58.329 --> 08:59.330
[groans]

09:06.128 --> 09:07.630
[Sonic] Nine, get down!

09:10.716 --> 09:11.592
Whoa!

09:21.102 --> 09:23.813
All right, Rusty and Black Rose!

09:26.274 --> 09:28.609
Who is useless now?

09:28.693 --> 09:31.237
Oh, that traitor will pay for that!

09:31.320 --> 09:32.738
[Sonic] Ha-ha!

09:34.115 --> 09:35.366
I can get us to the Void.

09:37.451 --> 09:39.370
[Eggforcers beeping]

09:39.453 --> 09:41.956
But right now, we need to move. Come on!

09:42.039 --> 09:43.624
How can you get us to the Void?

09:43.708 --> 09:47.545
Well, I don't want to get all science-y,
but basically, I run fast and boom...

09:47.628 --> 09:48.629
a portal opens.

09:48.713 --> 09:51.299
And you've done this lots of times?
Turn right!

09:52.967 --> 09:54.719
Not exactly lots of times...

09:54.802 --> 09:56.470
How many? Make a left.

09:57.888 --> 10:01.017
Once on purpose,
and I wasn't pushing a giant Shard case.

10:01.100 --> 10:03.311
-But it was super cool!
-Turn right!

10:09.817 --> 10:13.112
Ugh, I'll never get up to speed
with all these Eggforcers on us!

10:13.195 --> 10:15.072
Sorry pal, but I think
we're going to have to use

10:15.156 --> 10:16.365
one of those portals to escape.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.159
It's not a good idea.

10:18.242 --> 10:20.786
It portals directly
into another Shatterspace.

10:20.870 --> 10:22.038
They can't be stable.

10:23.956 --> 10:26.417
Well, they came through and they're okay.

10:26.500 --> 10:28.169
All right, fine.

10:28.252 --> 10:29.670
Through the portals it is!

10:45.936 --> 10:47.647

10:52.109 --> 10:53.778
-[grunts]
-Gotcha!

10:53.861 --> 10:54.737
Thanks.

10:54.820 --> 10:57.323
Hey, don't mention it,
that's what friends are for.

10:57.406 --> 10:58.699
Buildings?

10:58.783 --> 10:59.992
Here?

11:01.827 --> 11:03.537
[babbles]

11:11.504 --> 11:14.090
Two on your six. Can't you go any faster?

11:14.173 --> 11:17.593
Not on this water. I'll never build up
enough speed like this.

11:23.891 --> 11:26.018
There be no wind in me sails!

11:26.102 --> 11:27.728
Curse these buildings.

11:27.812 --> 11:29.522
Ahoy, guys!

11:29.605 --> 11:31.482
Sonic! You be back!

11:31.565 --> 11:32.983
Ye got yer own boat!

11:33.067 --> 11:34.735
This isn't a boat.

11:34.819 --> 11:37.863
Technically, anything that floats
be a boat.

11:39.865 --> 11:43.411
Actually, we're just passing through.
Any chance you could help us out?

11:43.494 --> 11:45.746
Helping you out only brings more trouble,

11:45.830 --> 11:48.624
but if you could sweeten the deal?

11:49.708 --> 11:52.169
Wouldn't you like another crack
at these guys?

11:52.253 --> 11:55.464
Argh! They really put the bog in me boots

11:55.548 --> 11:58.717
and I've been itching to use the cannons.

11:58.801 --> 12:00.177
Thanks, Batten!

12:05.349 --> 12:07.476
[Dr. Don't]
What do they think they're doing?

12:07.560 --> 12:09.520
-They're boat is made of wood!
-[loud thud]

[Dr. Don't and Dr. Babbles grunting]

12:11.939 --> 12:13.691
[Sonic] Whoa!

12:19.405 --> 12:22.116
Having friends in all the Shatterspaces
comes in handy.

12:23.117 --> 12:24.618
Just wait 'til you meet Tails.

12:24.702 --> 12:27.413
-You're gonna love him! Dread?
-[Knuckles] Argh!

12:27.496 --> 12:29.498
I want me beauty.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.292
I know ye have it.

12:31.375 --> 12:34.253
Yeah, sure is great having friends.

12:34.336 --> 12:36.881
Come on, dude,
I thought you and I were cool now.

12:36.964 --> 12:38.591
Ye thought wrong.

12:40.551 --> 12:42.136
Hyah!

12:42.219 --> 12:43.429
[grunts]

12:45.014 --> 12:47.600
Get outta here, Sonic. I'll handle this.

12:53.647 --> 12:57.401
I get why you don't like me,
but you guys should be friends!

12:57.485 --> 13:00.321
Not gonna happen.
I already have enough friends.

13:00.404 --> 13:04.492
The only friend I need is me beauty. Argh!

13:06.911 --> 13:09.163
The Council's forces
are converging on you.

13:09.246 --> 13:11.749
You brought the trouble.
Now take it with you.

13:11.832 --> 13:13.167
We've got bigger problems.

13:14.752 --> 13:17.046
-We need to go.
-I'll buy you some time.

13:21.842 --> 13:23.469
No! Come back!

13:24.261 --> 13:26.138
[Mr. Dr. Eggman] Ooh! There you are.

13:26.222 --> 13:29.558
Sonic and the Shards are headed
to the Boscage Portal!

13:29.642 --> 13:31.602
All forces converge!

13:43.072 --> 13:45.824
[Nine screaming]

13:52.706 --> 13:54.333
-That was...
-Fun, right?

13:54.416 --> 13:55.876
Get used to it.

13:55.960 --> 13:59.255
Once we put the prism back together,
things will be nonstop awesome

13:59.338 --> 14:00.839
all the time in Green Hill.

14:01.882 --> 14:02.925
Green Hill?

14:07.096 --> 14:09.181
Chaos Council's not playing around.

14:09.265 --> 14:11.350
They won't stop coming
until they have the Shards.

14:11.433 --> 14:13.185
We need to get to the Void. Now.

14:13.269 --> 14:15.145
Agreed. I just need a runway.

14:32.997 --> 14:35.291
This deforestation
and commercial construction

14:35.374 --> 14:37.293
is really starting to tick me off.

14:37.376 --> 14:39.295
[Thorn]
You're not the only one...

14:40.337 --> 14:43.757
-and your friend looks a lot like Mangey.
-Who's that?

14:45.926 --> 14:48.178
Thorn Rose, meet Tails Nine.

14:48.262 --> 14:49.680
It's just Nine.

14:49.763 --> 14:51.140
What have you done now?

14:51.223 --> 14:53.309
Not me. Them!

14:54.351 --> 14:57.605
I won't let them do
more damage to my jungle.

14:57.688 --> 14:59.607
[rumbling]

14:59.690 --> 15:01.567
An earthquake! Now?

15:01.650 --> 15:04.194
Can't Mother Nature see
I'm trying to save reality?

15:04.945 --> 15:07.406
That was no earthquake. Look!

15:08.991 --> 15:10.284
That's not good.

15:10.367 --> 15:13.454
Their powers are intensifying
because of the close proximity.

15:13.537 --> 15:15.372
The case won't hold them much longer.

15:16.123 --> 15:18.083
[sighs] Can you clear a runway?

15:19.752 --> 15:21.837
For Boscage Maze!

15:24.798 --> 15:27.217
-[caws]
-[warrior scream]

15:43.442 --> 15:46.236
[warrior scream]

15:50.157 --> 15:51.784
[both] Who is that?

15:52.952 --> 15:56.330
Gotta go fast!

16:02.086 --> 16:04.880
What just happened? Where is Sonic?

16:04.964 --> 16:06.382
Where are the Shards?

16:07.716 --> 16:10.344
[Sonic panting]

16:10.427 --> 16:11.679
Sonic!

16:20.771 --> 16:21.855
It's about time.

16:24.233 --> 16:26.318
Nine, meet Shadow, Shadow, meet Nine.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.363
You're not another version of Sonic.

16:29.446 --> 16:31.115
But you could be twins!

16:31.198 --> 16:34.785
Hardly, I am the ultimate life form.

16:35.369 --> 16:37.705
Don't listen to him. Come on!

16:44.086 --> 16:47.589
[Ghost Hill Tails] As long as I'm around,
you'll always have a wingman.

16:47.673 --> 16:50.134
[Ghost Hill Amy] The forest is
the most beautiful place on earth.

16:50.217 --> 16:51.969
[Ghost Hill Knuckles]
I don't need the details.

16:52.052 --> 16:53.137
Just tell me who to smash.

16:53.220 --> 16:55.180
[growls] Sycophantic wish fulfillment.

16:55.264 --> 16:59.101
This world,
it's like an embryonic Shatterspace,

16:59.184 --> 17:02.062
like it got stuck in the blueprint phase
while forming.

17:02.646 --> 17:03.564
Hmm.

17:03.647 --> 17:06.275
Perhaps it would be useful
in finishing the Grim--

17:06.358 --> 17:08.027
[Ghost Hill Rouge]
...but I get things done.

17:08.110 --> 17:10.988
[Ghost Hill Tails] As long as I'm around,
you'll always have a wingman.

17:11.071 --> 17:13.824
This is the friend Sonic thought
was like me?

17:13.907 --> 17:16.118
[scoffs] We're nothing alike.

17:18.704 --> 17:20.497
[rumbling]

17:20.581 --> 17:21.457
What just happened?

17:21.540 --> 17:23.125
Another reality quake.

17:23.208 --> 17:25.294
We don't have much time. We need to hurry.

17:25.377 --> 17:26.503
Follow me.

17:35.637 --> 17:37.264
[Sonic] It's finally over.

17:37.347 --> 17:40.142
Now we just have to rebuild the prism!

17:40.225 --> 17:41.143
[Nine] Stop!

17:41.226 --> 17:43.145
It's not that simple.

17:43.228 --> 17:45.022
The alignment must be perfect.

17:45.105 --> 17:48.525
The slightest variation
could have massive repercussions.

17:48.609 --> 17:51.737
People, places,
and things can be ripped from existence.

17:51.820 --> 17:53.864
One small mistake, and poof!

17:53.947 --> 17:55.783
Reality is changed forever.

17:57.493 --> 17:59.620
Tiny details are not my thing.

17:59.703 --> 18:03.665
I can do it.
I just have to make some calculations.

18:03.749 --> 18:04.875
How can we help?

18:04.958 --> 18:06.543
I need to be left alone to work.

18:07.127 --> 18:08.295
No distractions.

18:08.378 --> 18:10.047
Too many in a tight space.

18:10.756 --> 18:12.633
I don't want anything to go wrong.

18:13.217 --> 18:16.136
I'll take Sonic outside.
Best to keep him away.

18:16.762 --> 18:18.388
Thanks for putting it together, buddy.

18:18.472 --> 18:20.516
This is why we're a great team.

18:26.814 --> 18:27.898
First things first,

18:27.981 --> 18:30.359
I've got to stabilize the Shard energy.

18:32.027 --> 18:34.071
How do you know you can trust him?

18:34.154 --> 18:35.948
Trust is an issue for you, Shadow.

18:36.031 --> 18:37.908
That's why you don't have any friends.

18:37.991 --> 18:40.953
I don't think your friend wants
the same thing we do.

18:41.036 --> 18:42.287
Hey, cheer up!

18:42.371 --> 18:44.748
We're so close to this all being over!

18:44.832 --> 18:48.168
Once Nine rebuilds the Paradox Prism,
and Green Hill reforms,

18:48.252 --> 18:50.921
everything will finally be back to normal.

18:51.004 --> 18:54.091
-We did it!
-[crackling]

18:56.176 --> 18:57.678
I may have spoken too soon.

19:00.222 --> 19:04.643
[Mr. Dr. Eggman]
A new world, with yet another Shard!

19:04.726 --> 19:07.312
[evil laugh]

19:07.396 --> 19:08.272
Wonderful.

19:11.441 --> 19:14.361
