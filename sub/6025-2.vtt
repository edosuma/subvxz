WEBVTT

00:14.320 --> 00:15.367
Holy shit.

00:17.040 --> 00:18.121
What the fuck is that?

00:18.320 --> 00:21.369
Uh, that is Jared Dunn.

00:21.440 --> 00:23.044
He works for Gavin Belson.

00:25.760 --> 00:28.491
Hey. Sorry if I scared you.

00:28.560 --> 00:31.882
I know I have somewhat ghost-like features.

00:31.960 --> 00:35.328
My uncle used to say, "You look like
someone starved a virgin to death."

00:36.000 --> 00:37.490
It's... Yeah. I can see it.

00:37.560 --> 00:38.607
- Mmm.
- Mmm-hmm.

00:41.120 --> 00:42.849
I heard you were having a launch party.

00:43.520 --> 00:45.682
- Yeah.
- Am I early?

00:46.200 --> 00:47.201
No.

00:49.920 --> 00:52.764
Well, then a gift of congratulations.

00:53.040 --> 00:54.280
Now if Gavin sent you here,

00:54.360 --> 00:55.805
you should know that I've turned him down.

00:55.880 --> 00:56.881
I'm going with Peter Gregory.

00:56.960 --> 00:58.485
I'm actually picking up my check tomorrow.

00:58.560 --> 00:59.846
So I've made my decision.

00:59.920 --> 01:02.491
That's not why I'm here.
It's just...

01:03.200 --> 01:06.647
Watching you say no to $10 million
to build your own thing,

01:06.720 --> 01:09.371
there's just something
very exciting about that.

01:09.480 --> 01:12.006
Whoa. Whoa, whoa! What is he doing here?

01:12.320 --> 01:14.846
Hey, this is a private party, buddy.
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

01:15.080 --> 01:17.367
- Oh, I didn't mean to...
- You know, in the state of California

01:17.440 --> 01:20.330
you can kill a man for entering
your house without permission.

01:20.400 --> 01:23.006
Okay. I understand. Thank you.

01:23.280 --> 01:24.281
Oh.

01:25.680 --> 01:28.160
Richard, I just wanna say,
I really respect what you're doing here.

01:28.320 --> 01:32.086
And if you could ever use someone
with my business-development skill set,

01:32.160 --> 01:34.731
- I would love to be a part of this.
- The fuck you will be.

01:35.280 --> 01:37.328
We'll call you when we want pleated khakis.

01:42.160 --> 01:44.447
You know this is a fucking domestic?

01:44.520 --> 01:46.204
Why were you so mean to him?

01:46.360 --> 01:48.567
He wasn't spying on us.
He just said he likes us.

01:48.640 --> 01:50.768
- He wants to join the company.
- Of course he does, Richard.

01:50.880 --> 01:52.166
Let me explain something to you.

01:52.240 --> 01:54.641
Your whole life you've been an ugly chick,

01:54.760 --> 01:56.967
but now suddenly you're a hot chick,

01:57.040 --> 01:58.963
with big tits and small nipples.

01:59.040 --> 02:00.883
So guys like that
are gonna keep coming around.

02:01.040 --> 02:02.485
Don't be a slut, Richard.

02:02.920 --> 02:04.200
I don't...

02:04.680 --> 02:06.808
Now speaking of such things,

02:06.880 --> 02:09.121
Dinesh, change the lighting
to something erotic

02:09.199 --> 02:12.761
because it's about to get
pretty fucking erotic in here.

02:12.880 --> 02:16.566
License to Kill-9. IBAction-dot-Erotica.

02:17.480 --> 02:19.130
What... What's going on?

02:19.320 --> 02:22.449
- What's happening?
- Gentlemen, I present to you

02:23.560 --> 02:25.130
Mochacino.

02:25.520 --> 02:26.806
Not this guy.

02:27.600 --> 02:28.761
Mochacino.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.084
She's my gift to you.

02:35.680 --> 02:37.523
You wanna smoke weed?

02:43.760 --> 02:44.761
Um...

02:47.120 --> 02:48.281
Hey.

02:48.520 --> 02:50.568
Can somebody play something
with a beat, please?

02:50.720 --> 02:52.768
I'll go make a playlist.

02:52.840 --> 02:56.208
Yeah. I actually have
some water cooking, I think.

03:04.240 --> 03:06.163
Yeah, I don't pay for it, so

03:06.720 --> 03:09.087
barking up the wrong tree here.

03:10.640 --> 03:11.801
God, I hate Palo Alto.

03:24.960 --> 03:26.371
Hello again.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.124
You know, I don't actually have
a ton of dance music,

03:28.200 --> 03:29.360
but I turned the bass way up.

03:29.640 --> 03:31.051
Baby,

03:31.120 --> 03:32.645
you're getting a private show.

03:33.520 --> 03:35.204
Hey-

03:35.280 --> 03:36.964
What the fuck?

03:37.040 --> 03:38.929
Okay. There's the butt time.

03:41.280 --> 03:43.089
Should we have left him
in there by himself?

03:43.200 --> 03:44.440
Should we go back in there?

03:44.520 --> 03:47.091
No interest. I entice the flesh,
I don't pay for it.

03:47.160 --> 03:48.844
Plus, Tara's coming into town
in a couple of weeks.

03:48.920 --> 03:50.649
I'm saving up all my humors for her.

03:50.720 --> 03:52.051
You know what I mean?

03:52.120 --> 03:53.963
- What's your excuse?
- I didn't even shake

03:54.040 --> 03:56.725
a woman's hand until I was 17 years old.

03:56.840 --> 04:00.242
The idea of getting an erection
around men I live and work with,

04:00.320 --> 04:03.369
it's just not something I can handle.

04:03.440 --> 04:05.568
The idea that I have a boner
and you have a boner

04:05.680 --> 04:06.966
and he has a boner and
we're all sitting there

04:07.040 --> 04:08.565
with boners in our pants...

04:09.000 --> 04:10.764
I wonder if he's okay in there.

04:11.160 --> 04:13.640
So what do you guys do here?

04:13.720 --> 04:17.088
Oh, we're mostly working on
a lossless compression algorithm.

04:18.480 --> 04:20.084
- A what?
- It makes files smaller.

04:20.160 --> 04:21.810
Doesn't matter. It's called Pied Piper.

04:21.880 --> 04:24.360
It's gonna be famous.
You'll know it, eventually.

04:25.800 --> 04:28.320
Who was this woman that you shook
hands with for the first time?

04:28.800 --> 04:29.847
The postman lady.

04:30.160 --> 04:32.128
- What?
- A woman that was a man?

04:32.200 --> 04:34.328
Not a post-man lady.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.607
- A lady who was a post...
- Let me ask you another question.

04:36.680 --> 04:38.648
Who was the second woman
you shook hands with?

04:38.720 --> 04:39.846
I didn't even know
you were coming.

04:39.920 --> 04:41.331
- Stop. Doug!
- Oh, boy.

04:42.040 --> 04:43.041
- Stop.
- I'm the one...

04:43.120 --> 04:45.122
Someone is paying me. Okay? I didn't come

04:45.200 --> 04:47.487
just to dance on your
boner all night for free.

04:47.560 --> 04:50.962
I was not erect. That was...
I was only being polite.

04:51.120 --> 04:52.690
So you were being polite when
you said that you loved me?

04:52.760 --> 04:55.525
First off, I said you seemed
like someone I could fall in love with.

04:55.600 --> 04:57.204
And, yes, also politeness.

04:57.400 --> 04:58.686
Richie, pay the lady.

04:59.360 --> 05:01.328
What? Why should I pay her?

05:01.400 --> 05:03.360
I didn't hire her. I didn't
even get a lap dance.

05:03.400 --> 05:05.641
This is a company party
and you're the CEO, so pony up.

05:05.720 --> 05:07.882
No. If anyone should pay her,
it should be you.

05:08.480 --> 05:10.960
Doug, help the CEO find his money.

05:11.080 --> 05:13.367
No. No, no. We don't need help.

05:13.440 --> 05:14.680
I know where it is. It's here.

05:14.880 --> 05:16.120
- It's all here.
Mmm-hmm.

05:16.200 --> 05:17.725
I don't know... Do you accept AMEX?

05:17.800 --> 05:20.531
- You damn right I do.
- Put 100 on there for yourself, Mocha.

05:20.680 --> 05:22.364
Oh. Well, that's an expensive boner.

05:22.440 --> 05:23.441
Not a boner.

05:26.080 --> 05:27.730
Thanks for coming in, guys.

05:28.400 --> 05:31.768
We have a lot to do, so let's get started.

05:32.200 --> 05:33.361
Sounds great.

05:42.240 --> 05:43.651
Me? Okay.

05:44.080 --> 05:45.081
Uh...

05:45.760 --> 05:51.130
Well, we're just really excited
to get going, Mr. Gregory.

05:51.200 --> 05:53.521
Yes. Who-S "We"?

05:54.280 --> 05:55.691
Myself, him,

05:56.160 --> 05:58.322
- uh, the guys back at the house.
- Guys?

05:59.760 --> 06:00.966
What guys?

06:01.920 --> 06:03.445
Who is this?

06:03.640 --> 06:05.802
Erlich Bachman. I'm an entrepreneur,

06:05.920 --> 06:07.126
much like yourself.

06:07.320 --> 06:08.321
Uh...

06:09.280 --> 06:11.408
Richard actually developed Pied Piper

06:11.480 --> 06:13.005
while residing in my incubator,

06:13.120 --> 06:16.761
so as per our agreement,
I own 10% of the company.

06:17.120 --> 06:19.168
I'm paying you $200,000 for 5%,

06:19.240 --> 06:20.480
yet you're giving this man

06:21.000 --> 06:24.447
twice that in exchange for a futon

06:25.120 --> 06:26.963
and some sandwiches?

06:27.360 --> 06:29.886
Actually, sir, my tenants
provide their own food.

06:29.960 --> 06:31.680
What other percentages
have you apportioned?

06:32.320 --> 06:35.802
Can I see your cap table,
investment deck,

06:35.880 --> 06:38.770
business plan,
or any other relevant paperwork

06:39.000 --> 06:40.729
you may have prepared?

06:41.200 --> 06:44.249
I just was under the impression that

06:44.640 --> 06:47.769
we would just be coming by
and saying, "Hi," you know, uh,

06:48.000 --> 06:49.445
to pick up the check.

06:49.560 --> 06:52.643
And I just didn't know that
any of that stuff was due yet.

06:52.800 --> 06:53.847
"Due"?

06:57.120 --> 06:58.724
This is not college, Richard.

06:58.800 --> 07:01.610
I am not going to be
giving you a course syllabus.

07:01.920 --> 07:05.686
You turned down $10 million
to keep Pied Piper.

07:05.960 --> 07:09.965
What did you give up that money for?
What is this company?

07:10.920 --> 07:12.160
What did I buy?

07:12.280 --> 07:14.726
- You bought the algorithm, which...
- No.

07:16.280 --> 07:19.443
The algorithm is the
product of the company.

07:19.520 --> 07:20.520
I know that.

07:20.560 --> 07:23.086
What I'm asking about
is the company itself.

07:23.160 --> 07:25.481
Who is it? What do they do?

07:26.000 --> 07:27.331
Are they essential?

07:27.680 --> 07:30.968
Or do you just throw a percentage at them,
like you did with this...

07:36.360 --> 07:39.762
This all must be worked out.

07:40.240 --> 07:41.241
Now.

07:43.520 --> 07:45.921
When you said you'd guide us

07:46.000 --> 07:48.048
through some of this stuff,
I thought that this was

07:48.120 --> 07:49.770
the stuff you'd be guiding us through.

07:50.040 --> 07:53.567
I cannot guide you until you give me

07:54.880 --> 07:56.882
something to guide.

07:59.400 --> 08:01.084
This is going very poorly.

08:01.480 --> 08:04.404
- I know.
- He doesn't seem to know what he's doing.

08:09.280 --> 08:11.362
Did you just take a sip from an empty cup?

08:12.600 --> 08:13.681
Yes.

08:13.840 --> 08:14.921
Why did you do that?

08:16.240 --> 08:19.403
- Just something to do.
- Come back in 48 hours

08:19.560 --> 08:21.164
with an airtight business plan,

08:21.240 --> 08:23.481
a clear go-to-market strategy,

08:23.920 --> 08:27.891
and three-year summary P&L,
or there will be no check.

08:32.440 --> 08:33.726
That's it.

08:34.440 --> 08:36.283
Thanks for coming in, guys.

08:38.400 --> 08:39.400
Um...

08:39.480 --> 08:41.801
Are there any water
fountains in your offices?

08:42.679 --> 08:43.760
I assume.

08:43.840 --> 08:47.447
I own 10% of an app
that locates all nearby water fountains.

08:47.600 --> 08:48.840
I'd be happy to discuss it with you.

08:48.920 --> 08:50.649
Good day, gentlemen.

08:51.920 --> 08:53.001
You smoke weed?

08:58.160 --> 08:59.366
You really embarrassed me in there.

08:59.440 --> 09:01.966
You didn't say shit about
any business plan before today.

09:02.040 --> 09:04.681
And neither did he. And he was
kind of being an asshole back there.

09:04.720 --> 09:06.051
Yeah, that's why he's a billionaire.

09:06.120 --> 09:07.921
'Cause he knows how
and when to be an asshole.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.001
That's what you need to be like.

09:09.080 --> 09:10.889
- You do, Richard.
- Whatever.

09:10.960 --> 09:14.646
If you continue to mismanage this company,
giving 10% to whoever...

09:14.800 --> 09:17.041
Obviously, you know,
we can't go back on my shares.

09:17.160 --> 09:19.367
That ship has sailed,
but from here on out...

09:19.520 --> 09:21.170
Now you're being an asshole.

09:21.240 --> 09:22.810
You say that like it's a bad thing.

09:22.960 --> 09:25.247
Richard, if you're not an asshole,
it creates this kind of

09:25.320 --> 09:29.723
asshole vacuum and that void
is filled by other assholes, like Jared.

09:29.800 --> 09:31.484
I mean, you almost gave him shares.

09:32.320 --> 09:34.766
You need to completely
change who you are, Richard.

09:34.840 --> 09:37.207
A complete Teutonic shift has to happen.

09:37.920 --> 09:40.321
- Tectonic.
- What?

09:40.720 --> 09:43.849
A "tectonic" shift is
the Earth's crust moving around.

09:44.080 --> 09:46.082
"Teutonic," which is what you just said,

09:46.160 --> 09:48.891
is an ancient Germanic tribe
that fought the Romans.

09:50.280 --> 09:51.611
They were originally from Scandinavia...

09:51.680 --> 09:53.603
Stop it! Stop it.

09:54.440 --> 09:56.602
You're being a complete tool right now.

09:56.760 --> 09:59.047
I need you to be a complete asshole.

09:59.720 --> 10:00.881
Do you understand the difference?

10:01.000 --> 10:03.002
If you're not an asshole,
this company dies.

10:03.400 --> 10:05.289
Erlich, I have 48 hours.

10:05.400 --> 10:07.601
Are you going to help me
with this business plan or not?

10:08.040 --> 10:11.283
I believe in you, Richard.
That's why I'm not.

10:15.640 --> 10:19.042
"Business plans that are created
in support of new ventures"

10:19.120 --> 10:22.727
"or to implement profound
changes in existing venture."

10:35.160 --> 10:37.242
Hi, this is Richard Hendricks.

10:37.800 --> 10:39.290
Is now a good time?

10:40.680 --> 10:42.125
Uh, I need some help.

10:46.600 --> 10:48.284
Whose Chevy Volt is that out front?

10:48.720 --> 10:50.006
Jared Dunn's.

10:50.240 --> 10:52.242
What? Why? Why is he here?

10:52.360 --> 10:56.081
Well, because, as you know,
I need some advice on the business plan.

10:56.400 --> 10:57.401
You're cutting him in?

10:58.560 --> 10:59.561
Um...

11:02.400 --> 11:05.961
Good morning. Whoops, that was weird.

11:06.080 --> 11:07.889
I don't know why I did that.

11:08.320 --> 11:11.085
You kind of have a...
Like a king-ish feeling to you.

11:11.160 --> 11:13.925
You're like a Norse hero from Valhalla.

11:14.160 --> 11:15.207
Don't pander to me.

11:15.320 --> 11:17.766
Peter Gregory said
specifically to trim the fat.

11:18.080 --> 11:20.606
They actually tried to diagnose me
with a wasting disease

11:20.680 --> 11:22.364
because of my slender frame.

11:22.720 --> 11:27.282
So, um, I ironed out
our customer acquisition strategy,

11:27.360 --> 11:31.331
and I wrapped our financials.
I did a DCF valuation.

11:31.400 --> 11:35.246
Most VCs can't even do that math,
but something tells me Peter is different.

11:35.960 --> 11:38.440
I think we can jump into
the one-on-ones with each team member

11:38.520 --> 11:40.602
- to see if I can defend our cap table.
- Okay.

11:41.240 --> 11:44.050
But first, if you don't mind,
I'd like to use the restroom.

11:44.400 --> 11:46.971
Uh, yeah. You don't have to
ask permission to do that.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.883
Why, have you not gone
since you've been here?

11:49.120 --> 11:50.167
I have not.

11:52.680 --> 11:54.921
Well... Well, go. I mean, go.

11:56.480 --> 11:59.051
Denpok, I know you were in Aspen.
Thank you for coming.

11:59.280 --> 12:00.725
Please, have a seat.

12:02.920 --> 12:04.445
I'm not sitting this summer.

12:05.200 --> 12:07.726
Of course. Incredible.

12:11.680 --> 12:14.126
What's weighing on you, Gavin?

12:14.240 --> 12:16.481
Jared Dunn quit today to join Pied Piper.

12:16.640 --> 12:20.326
I hate Richard Hendricks,
that little Pied Piper prick.

12:22.080 --> 12:23.844
Ls... Is that wrong?

12:24.160 --> 12:26.970
In the hands of a lesser person, perhaps.

12:28.160 --> 12:30.845
But in the hands of the enlightened,

12:30.920 --> 12:33.810
hate can be a tool for great change.

12:35.320 --> 12:37.641
You're right once again.

12:41.880 --> 12:45.202
Audious, play John Lennon's Imagine.

12:45.720 --> 12:47.404
Cueing John Wayne

12:47.480 --> 12:49.687
In A Mansion. Not found.

12:50.200 --> 12:52.680
- Fuck! Fuck!
- Invalid command.

12:52.920 --> 12:57.130
Use the anger, Chela. Use it.

13:02.360 --> 13:06.888
Uh, thanks for sitting down like this,
Gilfoyle. We know it's kind of a little weird.

13:07.400 --> 13:12.327
So, um, can you kind of catch me up on
what you see as your role in the company?

13:12.640 --> 13:15.246
- What do you do?
- What do I do?

13:17.800 --> 13:20.565
System architecture.
Networking and security.

13:21.720 --> 13:23.609
No one in this house can touch me on that.

13:23.920 --> 13:25.490
Okay, that's good to know.

13:25.720 --> 13:27.210
But does anyone appreciate that?

13:27.280 --> 13:30.409
While you were busy
minoring in gender studies

13:30.480 --> 13:32.323
and singing a capella at Sarah Lawrence,

13:32.400 --> 13:35.244
I was gaining root access to NSA servers.

13:35.480 --> 13:38.643
I was one click away
from starting a second Iranian Revolution.

13:38.880 --> 13:40.086
I actually went to Vassar.

13:40.160 --> 13:43.767
I prevent cross-site scripting.
I monitor for DDOS attacks,

13:43.840 --> 13:47.526
emergency database rollbacks,
and faulty transaction handlings.

13:47.760 --> 13:49.205
The Internet... Heard of it?

13:49.320 --> 13:51.482
Transfers half a petabyte
of data every minute.

13:51.600 --> 13:54.251
Do you have any idea how that happens?

13:54.520 --> 13:56.887
All those YouPorn ones and zeroes
streaming directly

13:56.960 --> 13:59.327
to your shitty little smart
phone day after day?

13:59.440 --> 14:01.920
Every dipshit who shits his pants
if he can't get

14:02.000 --> 14:04.401
the new dubstep Skrillex remix
in under 12 seconds?

14:04.760 --> 14:07.127
It's not magic, it's talent and sweat.

14:07.720 --> 14:11.281
People like me ensuring your packets
get delivered un-sniffed.

14:11.360 --> 14:12.521
So what do I do?

14:12.920 --> 14:15.651
I make sure that one bad config
on one key component

14:15.720 --> 14:17.722
doesn't bankrupt the
entire fucking company.

14:17.800 --> 14:19.370
That's what the fuck I do.

14:20.640 --> 14:22.608
Um, that's basically what I told him.

14:22.960 --> 14:25.122
Listen, wherever we end up here,

14:26.120 --> 14:29.283
I just wanna say that I feel
I should get more equity than Dinesh.

14:29.800 --> 14:32.007
I know Gilfoyle probably
came in here and puked out

14:32.080 --> 14:33.241
a bunch of tech specs,

14:33.320 --> 14:36.005
three-fourths of which
are total horse-shit.

14:36.160 --> 14:38.322
Did he bring up the
Iranian Revolution thing?

14:39.120 --> 14:40.770
Yeah, those words mean nothing.

14:41.040 --> 14:42.405
But here's a fact,

14:42.480 --> 14:45.086
I'm the only one of these clowns
that can code in Java.

14:45.560 --> 14:48.131
And I write sleek, performant,
low-overhead Scala code

14:48.240 --> 14:51.164
with higher order functions
that will run on anything.

14:51.440 --> 14:53.602
Period. End of sentence.

14:53.760 --> 14:56.684
So, basically, I think
whatever equity I get,

14:57.160 --> 14:59.811
it should reflect that
I contribute more than Gilfoyle.

15:01.920 --> 15:04.730
- This is weird.
- I know, right? It's...

15:04.840 --> 15:07.161
- Everybody's been doing it.
- Gilfoyle did this?

15:07.480 --> 15:09.801
It's just a formality to get me caught up.

15:10.240 --> 15:12.846
So what makes you of value
to the Pied Piper team?

15:13.920 --> 15:14.921
Um...

15:15.320 --> 15:16.401
Programming, I guess.

15:16.480 --> 15:21.646
Pretty good at code,
develop algorithms, so forth.

15:21.720 --> 15:24.530
Different from the type of
algorithm Richard created?

15:25.000 --> 15:27.002
Well, yeah. Like, not as good.

15:27.920 --> 15:30.127
Richard's a 10X-er. I'm,
like, barely an X-er.

15:31.920 --> 15:33.001
I kinda suck.

15:33.200 --> 15:35.041
Smoked you. And now...

15:35.520 --> 15:37.887
- Don't be a dick.
- Mushroom stamp!

15:38.080 --> 15:41.368
- You're being a dick.
- Oh, there you go. Show that to your mom.

15:41.560 --> 15:44.131
Mushroom stamp! That's great.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.809
Hey, what do you guys
think about this Jared?

15:47.880 --> 15:48.881
He's shit, right?

15:49.360 --> 15:50.521
No, he's pretty sharp.

15:50.760 --> 15:53.001
Yeah, he does shit that
no one else in the house can do.

15:53.080 --> 15:55.960
Yeah, but he's a know-it-all.
I don't think there's room in here for him.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.082
Well, there will be
after Richard gets rid of Big Head.

15:58.160 --> 16:00.128
Wait, Richard's getting
rid of Big Head? Why?

16:00.240 --> 16:01.810
Listen, we all love Big Head.

16:01.880 --> 16:04.247
But the truth is, he's not
as good of a coder as I am,

16:04.320 --> 16:06.161
not as good at system architecture
as Gilfoyle,

16:06.600 --> 16:09.171
not as good at being a prick as you,
no offense.

16:09.280 --> 16:11.720
He's a lightweight at everything.
Brings nothing to the table.

16:12.320 --> 16:15.324
Him getting points would be
a big "fuck you" to all of us.

16:15.680 --> 16:19.765
- But he's a great guy.
- Great guy. But useless.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.562
Yeah, he is a great guy.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.243
Not like that Jared. Huh.

16:25.640 --> 16:27.529
At least we can all agree on that.

16:28.560 --> 16:29.891
Yeah, I don't know.

16:29.960 --> 16:33.009
Me and Richard have just always
been in this together, you know?

16:33.200 --> 16:34.201
Together, right.

16:34.280 --> 16:37.682
But to be clear, Richard created
the algorithm on his own, yes?

16:38.000 --> 16:39.601
Oh, yeah, I had nothing to do with that.

16:41.320 --> 16:43.482
- He's my best friend.
- That's true.

16:43.560 --> 16:46.564
Yes. The camaraderie is quite apparent.

16:46.640 --> 16:51.965
But Peter Gregory demanded
a lean, ruthless business plan,

16:52.040 --> 16:56.090
and I don't think that the CEO of Microsoft
has a paid best friend.

16:56.600 --> 16:59.410
Sergey Brin does.
Larry doesn't do shit.

16:59.480 --> 17:00.481
See.

17:01.920 --> 17:04.810
What if Big Head is sort of
like a floating utility player?

17:04.880 --> 17:06.608
Like a jack of all trades.

17:08.119 --> 17:12.569
But, by his own admission,
he's really more like a master of none.

17:12.680 --> 17:14.284
That's true. That is true.

17:14.359 --> 17:17.409
Which is not something
you'd generally reward with several points

17:17.480 --> 17:21.007
in what may someday be
a multi-billion dollar company.

17:21.440 --> 17:23.282
This will never fly with Peter Gregory.

17:25.480 --> 17:28.050
I would not want to be Richard right now.

17:28.119 --> 17:30.122
Having to tell Big Head that he's out.

17:30.640 --> 17:32.201
This is gonna sound super mean,

17:32.280 --> 17:34.726
but the other night he was sleeping,
I was just staring at his face.

17:34.800 --> 17:38.168
All I could think was,
"He's utterly useless."

17:38.480 --> 17:40.721
"Big Head is a man with zero purpose."

17:43.240 --> 17:46.801
- Oh, hi. Hi, Big Head.
- Hey.

17:46.960 --> 17:47.961
How's it going?

17:48.600 --> 17:51.331
It's super good right now.

17:51.560 --> 17:54.643
Um, I'm just going to maybe
go for a bike ride real fast

17:55.240 --> 17:58.084
and clear my... head.

17:58.400 --> 18:00.004
I'll see you.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.005
- Bike safe.
- Yeah, enjoy it.

18:02.160 --> 18:04.686
That was nice, guys. He heard everything.

18:04.840 --> 18:06.285
That doesn't make it not true.

18:06.360 --> 18:09.284
I mean, come on, Richard.
As far as Pied Piper is concerned,

18:09.400 --> 18:11.846
he's as pointless as Mass <i>Effect</i> 3's
multiple endings.

18:11.920 --> 18:15.527
I mean, he's a completely useless
appendage, and we all know it.

18:17.440 --> 18:19.920
- Oh, hey, man.
- Forgot my water bottle.

18:24.080 --> 18:29.041
Just gonna grab it, and then probably
walk right back through one more time.

18:30.520 --> 18:32.409
<i>I mean, Mass Effect 3?</i>

18:33.120 --> 18:34.121
Harsh.

18:34.240 --> 18:36.129
I didn't mean for him to hear it,
but it was true.

18:36.200 --> 18:39.727
I mean, we all called him a great guy,
but he didn't overhear any of that.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.884
It's been 12 hours.

18:43.360 --> 18:45.283
God damn. He's still not answering.

18:46.320 --> 18:48.721
You know...
I'm actually kind of worried about him.

18:48.800 --> 18:52.407
You know, if he's gone,
like, really, truly gone,

18:52.880 --> 18:55.360
in a way that kind of solves your problem.

18:55.600 --> 18:57.125
I mean, like, if he's dead...

18:57.240 --> 18:59.322
Are you trying to say
that Big Head might be dead?

18:59.400 --> 19:01.323
That doesn't help at all.
How is that helping?

19:01.400 --> 19:04.404
I'm just saying that that's a possible
thing that could've happened to him.

19:04.480 --> 19:05.766
It could happen to anybody.

19:05.840 --> 19:09.128
And in this case, at least
something good came out of it.

19:09.200 --> 19:10.440
What's the good part?

19:10.520 --> 19:12.409
You don't have to have
an awkward conversation.

19:12.480 --> 19:14.608
That's scary. Should we go look for him?

19:14.680 --> 19:18.048
I mean, I agree with these guys.
Jared's just not working out.

19:18.520 --> 19:19.567
What?

19:20.200 --> 19:21.326
Um, Richard...

19:21.920 --> 19:24.207
I don't wanna be too assertive here,

19:24.280 --> 19:27.250
but I could use your input
on a few things for the business plan.

19:27.320 --> 19:29.971
Richie, you tried your best.
Just call him, leave a message,

19:30.040 --> 19:31.121
say he's out.

19:31.200 --> 19:32.804
No, that's an asshole move.

19:32.880 --> 19:35.850
Yeah, remember? You need to be an asshole.

19:36.880 --> 19:39.770
I feel bad about saying that thing
about him being dead.

19:39.840 --> 19:41.001
That's not who I am.

19:44.360 --> 19:46.727
- Wait, what is that?
- That's impossible.

19:48.120 --> 19:49.451
NipAlert isn't live yet.

19:49.520 --> 19:51.090
Maybe he's demoing it for someone.

19:52.760 --> 19:54.524
"Mochacino."

19:54.600 --> 19:57.001
He rode his bike to San Jose?

19:57.080 --> 19:58.286
Jared, can I borrow your car?

19:58.360 --> 20:00.203
- Sure.
- I have a car.

20:00.280 --> 20:02.203
What's wrong with my car?

20:02.280 --> 20:03.770
I just have... I don't know.

20:04.120 --> 20:06.282
All right, well, remember to be an asshole.

20:08.480 --> 20:10.801
A real asshole.

20:17.520 --> 20:20.922
Hi, I'm Richard Hendricks.
You did a dance... The dancing at my house.

20:21.040 --> 20:22.724
Your ride's here.

20:22.960 --> 20:24.371
Oh, hey, man.

20:24.480 --> 20:26.164
- Hey.
- Mushroom stamp!

20:26.360 --> 20:28.966
No, come on, dude, not again...

20:31.160 --> 20:33.561
I just wanted to work with
computers and get paid for it.

20:33.640 --> 20:37.122
I didn't want end up fighting with
my roommates over percentage points.

20:37.280 --> 20:38.486
So you're just gonna give up?

20:38.560 --> 20:41.370
On what? This isn't home.

20:41.440 --> 20:43.602
As much as I've tried, it's just not.

20:44.000 --> 20:47.209
I mean, what would I have even done
if I didn't have Mochacino's card?

20:47.280 --> 20:48.770
Where would I have gone?

20:49.440 --> 20:51.124
It's fucking pathetic.

20:51.200 --> 20:54.602
Well, Mochacino seemed to like you.
She let you into her apartment.

20:54.680 --> 20:56.409
I had to give her my bike.

20:56.480 --> 20:58.608
She's just like everyone else
in this goddamn valley.

20:58.680 --> 21:01.843
Watching the bottom line.
Fuck it, dude. I'm done here.

21:02.360 --> 21:03.486
What about NipAlert?

21:04.240 --> 21:08.802
Mochacino shows her tits for a living,
and even she was uncomfortable using it.

21:08.880 --> 21:13.124
She said it was sexist.
She's right. It's actually perverted.

21:13.320 --> 21:16.608
I made a perverted, sexist, useless thing.

21:19.040 --> 21:21.281
And, you know, everybody's right, man,

21:21.360 --> 21:23.442
there's nothing for me to do on Pied Piper.

21:23.880 --> 21:27.009
I think over time,
maybe we could redefine your role.

21:27.120 --> 21:28.360
Come on, dude.

21:29.240 --> 21:31.640
Unless you can tell me right now
what I can do for Pied Piper

21:31.680 --> 21:34.570
that no one else can, I'm gone.

21:38.200 --> 21:39.611
- Yeah.
- Uh...

21:40.120 --> 21:42.851
I'm going to go get the stuff
out of my cube at Hooli,

21:42.920 --> 21:45.571
and then I'm getting the
hell out of this town.

21:49.280 --> 21:50.611
So this is goodbye then?

21:53.400 --> 21:55.323
I mean, I'll see you
back at the house, man.

21:55.400 --> 21:57.323
I gotta, like, pack and stuff.

21:57.400 --> 21:58.481
Oh, totally.

21:58.920 --> 22:01.924
I'm going to take the train, I think,
just do some thinking...

22:02.000 --> 22:03.570
Okay. All right, see you.

22:05.840 --> 22:08.411
- The train is this way... I just...
- Oh. I was gonna say.

22:08.760 --> 22:09.966
Big Head.

22:11.360 --> 22:14.284
Whatever shit you're about to dump
on my head, you can save it, okay?

22:14.360 --> 22:15.407
I'm not in the mood.

22:15.520 --> 22:17.284
Dude, I just wanted to tell you
that Gavin Belson

22:17.360 --> 22:18.521
wants to talk to you about something.

22:18.640 --> 22:21.803
- Oh, okay. Fuck you.
- No. Seriously.

22:22.240 --> 22:25.767
Gavin Belson said he wants
to speak to Nelson Bighetti?

22:26.040 --> 22:28.042
Yeah, that's what I just said.

22:29.640 --> 22:30.766
Come on.

22:32.880 --> 22:34.120
Okay...

22:40.120 --> 22:41.451
I'm awake! I'm awake.

22:42.640 --> 22:44.927
- What?
- No, no, I wasn't.

22:45.040 --> 22:49.364
I was sleeping. I'm sorry for sleeping
and for lying about it.

22:49.600 --> 22:51.329
For both. No good.

22:51.800 --> 22:52.881
What happened?

22:53.800 --> 22:54.881
Did you fire Big Head?

22:55.200 --> 22:57.521
Uh, no. Not yet. I don't know. Sort of.

22:57.720 --> 23:00.530
So, um, do I include him
in the cap table or not?

23:00.600 --> 23:01.931
It's basically good to go.

23:02.640 --> 23:06.201
Uh, no, he's out. Wait... I don't know.

23:06.320 --> 23:09.210
Actually, I just need to close
my eyes for a little bit. Okay?

23:09.280 --> 23:12.363
Richard, it's T-minus four hours
until presentation time.

23:12.640 --> 23:14.085
Are you gonna fire Big Head or not?

23:14.160 --> 23:15.650
I don't know. Uh...

23:16.880 --> 23:18.006
I'm just very tired.

23:18.080 --> 23:20.401
Okay? I'm just gonna go get some water...

23:20.480 --> 23:24.565
Richard, stop being a fucking pussy
and start being an asshole.

23:31.840 --> 23:35.640
Fine! You want me to be an asshole,
I'll be an asshole.

23:35.720 --> 23:38.724
I'll be an asshole to you
and you and you and you

23:38.800 --> 23:40.245
and Peter-fucking-Gregory!

23:40.680 --> 23:43.524
Okay? Fuck all of you. Big Head stays!

23:43.880 --> 23:46.611
You know, if I wanted to be a sell out,
I'd have done that already.

23:46.680 --> 23:49.490
I'd be on a beach somewhere
with $10 million in my pocket.

23:49.560 --> 23:52.530
Not in my pocket, in a bank account.

23:52.680 --> 23:56.401
Okay? This is my company.
It was my idea, and we do what I say.

23:56.680 --> 23:59.684
And what I say is, Jared,
put Big Head in the business plan.

23:59.920 --> 24:01.570
He gets the same amount of
shares as everybody else.

24:01.680 --> 24:04.206
Big Head, you're not going home, man.

24:04.680 --> 24:06.648
Uh, you're right. I'm not.

24:06.960 --> 24:09.804
Gavin Belson just offered me
a huge promotion

24:09.880 --> 24:13.089
for 600 grand a year
to steal me away from you guys.

24:13.440 --> 24:15.124
- What?
- Yeah. For revenge.

24:15.200 --> 24:16.406
Because you took Jared.

24:17.680 --> 24:19.250
So you're like the VP of spite?

24:19.760 --> 24:21.410
But you have to do me a favor, Richard,

24:21.520 --> 24:25.047
if you run into Gavin ever you have to
act really upset about it, you know?

24:25.240 --> 24:27.561
Oh, but I am upset.

24:28.640 --> 24:29.971
Okay? What the fuck?

24:30.040 --> 24:32.361
I kind of just went out on a limb
for you here, man.

24:33.080 --> 24:35.401
Sorry, man, but this is huge for me.

24:35.640 --> 24:37.608
I'm going to move out, get my own place.

24:37.880 --> 24:40.247
In light of this new information,

24:40.480 --> 24:42.608
who gets Big Head's equity?

24:42.720 --> 24:44.290
Should I get half of his shares...

24:44.360 --> 24:46.089
I do. I get it.

24:46.560 --> 24:48.050
Okay? I get all of it!

24:50.080 --> 24:53.323
Big Head, man,
congratulations on the job, really.

24:53.440 --> 24:56.410
But if you'll excuse me,
I have to go lock down

24:56.480 --> 24:58.767
a motherfucking business plan.
Jared, you're with me.

25:04.200 --> 25:05.440
What an asshole.

25:05.840 --> 25:08.730
Yeah. What an asshole.

25:14.360 --> 25:15.486
Next.

25:17.280 --> 25:18.884
- Hi.
- Deposit?

25:19.040 --> 25:20.087
Mmm-hmm.

25:24.760 --> 25:27.491
$200,000 from Peter Gregory?

25:27.760 --> 25:28.761
Mmm-hmm.

25:29.960 --> 25:31.081
Wow.

25:34.440 --> 25:35.441
Sorry.

25:37.760 --> 25:38.760
Hello?

25:38.800 --> 25:40.928
Dude, they're taking your code apart.

25:41.240 --> 25:42.571
- What?
- Yeah,

25:42.640 --> 25:46.361
did you give those brogrammer guys access
to a player download or something?

25:46.480 --> 25:47.970
Oh, shit.

25:48.040 --> 25:51.203
They probably hacked the prototype
and decompiled the compression library.

25:51.760 --> 25:54.161
Well, they've got it now, man.

25:54.280 --> 25:56.726
They're gonna reverse-engineer
a version as close as they can

25:56.800 --> 25:58.211
without getting sued.

25:58.320 --> 25:59.760
<i>Wait, wait, are you sure about this?</i>

25:59.800 --> 26:01.882
Yeah, dude, Gavin wants
to beat you to market.

26:01.960 --> 26:04.930
He wants to make sure no other investor
in the Valley offers you a dime.

26:05.400 --> 26:06.640
That is not good.

26:06.800 --> 26:10.009
They're calling it Nucleus,
whatever the fuck that means.

26:10.160 --> 26:14.006
Shit. Sorry, dude, I can't be
talking to you like this. Later.

26:14.440 --> 26:15.487
Yeah.

26:16.920 --> 26:18.126
"Nucleus"?

26:18.440 --> 26:22.729
Excuse me. This check is made out
to "Pied Piper incorporated."

26:22.800 --> 26:25.121
- Do you have an SS-4?
- A what?

26:25.280 --> 26:28.250
Is Pied Piper a corporation
registered with the IRS?

26:28.320 --> 26:30.163
I can't deposit that
into a personal account.

26:31.680 --> 26:33.011
I don't know.

26:33.680 --> 26:35.364
Is that something maybe
you could help me with?

26:35.520 --> 26:36.726
No, sir.

26:38.880 --> 26:40.211
Buddy, come on.

26:41.240 --> 26:43.163
Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah.

26:43.600 --> 26:45.284
- Thank you.
- Sorry. Okay.

26:47.360 --> 26:48.521
Next.
