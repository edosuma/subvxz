00:07.074 --> 00:08.540
- In December 1914,

00:08.542 --> 00:10.509
a series of horrific
murders were committed

00:10.511 --> 00:11.744
at a remote ranch.

00:11.746 --> 00:15.014
Police were never able
to identify a suspect.

00:18.619 --> 00:21.387
In December 1944, again,

00:21.389 --> 00:23.122
a series of horrific
murders occurred

00:23.124 --> 00:25.657
at the same remote ranch.

00:32.198 --> 00:35.601
Again, police were never
able to identify a suspect.

00:35.603 --> 00:37.669
In December 1994, again,

00:38.505 --> 00:42.541
a series of gruesome murders
took place at the same ranch.

00:43.676 --> 00:45.277
And once again,

00:45.279 --> 00:49.114
police were never able
to identify a suspect.

01:24.617 --> 01:25.517
- Harold!

01:26.653 --> 01:27.753
Harold, please!

01:29.189 --> 01:32.091
Harold!

02:10.663 --> 02:13.565
It's so peaceful way out here.

02:13.567 --> 02:16.502
- Yeah, maybe
that's why it was so

02:16.504 --> 02:17.569
inexpensive.

02:19.539 --> 02:21.640
Honestly, I can't believe
this house was on the market

02:21.642 --> 02:23.575
for over five years.

02:24.544 --> 02:26.612
- Maybe it was just waiting.

02:26.614 --> 02:27.646
For us.

02:27.648 --> 02:28.547
- Yeah.

02:29.649 --> 02:31.517
Yeah, I like that.

02:31.519 --> 02:31.517
Hey, with all the
money we saved up

02:31.519 --> 02:34.486
we should probably
knock out that barn.

02:34.488 --> 02:37.556
Or like, build like a
shop or a greenhouse.

02:37.558 --> 02:38.891
- Oh yeah.

02:38.893 --> 02:40.792
A greenhouse sounds nice.

02:40.794 --> 02:43.295
- Hey, you know what
else would be nice?

02:43.297 --> 02:46.265
If Neil and Emma actually
showed up on time for once.

02:46.267 --> 02:47.666
Just for once.

02:47.668 --> 02:51.170
They were supposed to
be here two hours ago.

02:51.172 --> 02:52.571
- Well, uh,

02:52.573 --> 02:57.442
maybe we could go check out
the inside while we wait.

02:57.444 --> 02:59.344
- Yeah, let's do that.

03:28.241 --> 03:28.941
So...

03:30.310 --> 03:31.944
About this furniture.

03:31.946 --> 03:34.680
- What about
this furniture?

03:34.682 --> 03:36.515
- Maybe we can sell all
of it on craigslist,

03:36.517 --> 03:39.451
make some money and buy
some different furniture?

03:39.453 --> 03:41.353
- Aw, I think it fits.

03:41.988 --> 03:43.789
- Yeah, I think it'd
fit for somebody.

03:43.791 --> 03:45.524
I don't think it
fits for us though.

03:45.526 --> 03:48.994
- No, it adds to the
whole country charm.

03:49.929 --> 03:51.463
- Yeah well, I bought this place

03:51.465 --> 03:53.732
'cause you wanted to
be in the country.

03:53.734 --> 03:56.568
Even though it added
an hour to my commute.

03:56.570 --> 03:56.568
- Neil said it was
only thirty minutes.

03:56.570 --> 04:01.740
- Well, Neil is thirty
minutes closer to the office.

04:01.742 --> 04:04.443
- You sound just like Martha.

04:04.445 --> 04:07.879
- When are you gonna
start calling my mom mom?

04:07.881 --> 04:10.415
- Whenever she stops treating
me like Satan incarnate.

04:10.417 --> 04:11.750
- She does not, she
treat you like--

04:11.752 --> 04:13.452
- really?

04:13.454 --> 04:14.987
She told me I was poisoning you.

04:14.989 --> 04:15.954
- That's because you didn't know

04:15.956 --> 04:17.555
I was allergic to shellfish.

04:17.558 --> 04:19.791
- No, it was before that.

04:19.793 --> 04:22.628
- Can we not talk about my mom?

04:51.557 --> 04:53.625
- Um, hey.

04:53.627 --> 04:53.625
- Hey.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.794
- Hey, yeah, sorry we're late.

04:55.796 --> 04:56.795
It's Neil's fault.

04:56.797 --> 04:56.795
- What, my fault?

04:56.797 --> 04:59.965
- Yes honey, I told you that
the truck would be ready

04:59.967 --> 05:02.501
two hours ago but you said no.

05:02.503 --> 05:04.903
- Yeah, well looks like
we timed this just right.

05:04.905 --> 05:08.607
Otherwise.

05:08.609 --> 05:12.844
- Alright man, you and me
on box patrol and girl time.

05:14.681 --> 05:15.747
What's up, man, love you.

05:15.749 --> 05:15.747
Boxes are right there.

05:15.749 --> 05:18.550
- Over here?
- Yeah, yeah.

05:27.094 --> 05:29.628
- Dude, you know this house

05:30.630 --> 05:32.564
is wicked old.

05:32.566 --> 05:35.467
- Yeah, tell me about it.

05:35.469 --> 05:36.635
- You know...

05:39.505 --> 05:41.573
You ever heard the story?

05:41.575 --> 05:43.508
- No, what story?

05:43.510 --> 05:44.576
- Neil, not tonight, okay?

05:44.578 --> 05:45.410
I mean, they're just moving--

05:45.412 --> 05:46.545
- there's no story.

05:46.547 --> 05:47.713
- Oh, there's a story.

05:47.715 --> 05:50.415
It was back in 1969.

05:50.417 --> 05:52.117
Or '79, no 1969, yeah.

05:53.619 --> 05:54.686
Their names?

05:55.421 --> 05:56.888
Their names were
George and Martha.

05:56.890 --> 05:58.390
- Neil can never
get the names right.

05:58.392 --> 05:59.491
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no.

05:59.493 --> 06:00.125
Their names were Abe and Mary.

06:00.127 --> 06:01.526
Abe and Mary Lincoln.

06:01.528 --> 06:03.662
Abe and Mary Johnson,
I'm positive.

06:03.664 --> 06:03.662
- Okay, really Neil,

06:03.664 --> 06:06.732
I don't think that Anne
and Harold are in the mood

06:06.734 --> 06:07.966
to hear one of
your ghost stories.

06:07.968 --> 06:09.568
- It's not a ghost story.

06:09.570 --> 06:10.669
It's...

06:12.038 --> 06:13.605
It's a dead story.

06:15.508 --> 06:17.776
It's the type of
story that'll get you

06:17.778 --> 06:18.677
dead.

06:20.747 --> 06:22.514
- Ooh.

06:22.516 --> 06:25.784
- Anyways, I don't know
all of the details.

06:25.786 --> 06:27.619
- He doesn't know
any of the details.

06:27.621 --> 06:31.556
- But they say that one
morning at like 2:00 am,

06:31.558 --> 06:33.692
that's the bewitching
hour and all.

06:33.694 --> 06:35.060
You mean 12:00 am.

06:35.062 --> 06:37.562
- Uh, Harold, you mind
if I tell the story?

06:37.564 --> 06:38.797
Thanks, bud.

06:38.799 --> 06:40.665
Anyways, it's 2:00 am
because that's when

06:40.667 --> 06:42.601
Jesus was killed or
something like that.

06:42.603 --> 06:43.635
- Resurrected.

06:43.637 --> 06:43.635
- Whatever.

06:43.637 --> 06:47.572
But one morning Mary
wakes up at 2:00 am

06:47.574 --> 06:49.641
and just rolls over in bed

06:49.643 --> 06:53.512
and plunges a butcher knife
straight into Abe's chest.

06:53.514 --> 06:55.480
For no reason.

06:55.482 --> 06:57.516
A few days later, when
the sheriff shows up,

06:57.518 --> 07:01.753
he found good ol' Abe just
a-swinging in the barn.

07:02.655 --> 07:04.122
All the while, good
ol' Mary's just sitting

07:04.124 --> 07:07.859
in the front lawn just
catching some rays.

07:07.861 --> 07:10.629
She was covered with blood but

07:11.597 --> 07:14.866
it was like she didn't
even know what happened.

07:14.868 --> 07:17.502
And here's the kicker.

07:17.504 --> 07:20.705
When the sheriff asked
her why she did it,

07:20.707 --> 07:23.675
she paused and said,
"i didn't do it.

07:24.877 --> 07:26.878
"The ghost killed him."

07:28.648 --> 07:29.548
The ghost.

07:29.550 --> 07:33.618
She said the ghost
of this house.

07:33.620 --> 07:37.956
Good old
Mary gave Abe 40

07:37.958 --> 07:38.857
whacks!

07:38.859 --> 07:42.794
Ho ho, but they never could
find the murder weapon.

07:45.132 --> 07:46.565
Who the hell's that?

07:51.170 --> 07:51.169
- Mom.

07:51.171 --> 07:53.171
- I hope I'm not intruding

07:53.173 --> 07:56.541
but I knew this was
your first night.

07:57.477 --> 07:58.477
- No, come in.

07:58.479 --> 08:00.479
- Well, I am intruding.

08:03.182 --> 08:04.649
Well, just for a moment.

08:04.651 --> 08:05.684
- Hi.

08:05.686 --> 08:07.185
- It was such a long drive.

08:07.187 --> 08:09.554
- You
remember Neil and Emma.

08:09.556 --> 08:13.725
- Well, I might be old
but I'm not senile.

08:13.727 --> 08:15.760
They were at your wedding.

08:18.531 --> 08:21.600
I see that you have
prepared a delicious meal

08:21.602 --> 08:23.001
for your guests.

08:27.807 --> 08:29.708
You might want to save
this for another night.

08:29.710 --> 08:30.809
- Okay.

08:30.811 --> 08:35.280
- I see that you have
drank the cheap stuff.

08:39.118 --> 08:40.018
Well...

08:41.687 --> 08:44.121
I will talk to you tomorrow.

08:44.124 --> 08:46.691
It's good to see
all of you again.

08:46.693 --> 08:48.193
- You too.

08:49.595 --> 08:52.297
- I want the best
for you, my son.

08:53.266 --> 08:56.034
It's the way of the world
that sons just don't

08:56.036 --> 08:58.637
listen to their mothers anymore.

08:58.639 --> 09:01.206
Goodnight, goodnight everyone.

09:08.214 --> 09:11.116
- God.

09:11.118 --> 09:11.116
Wow.

09:11.118 --> 09:16.121
Well, who needs ghost
stories when you've got her.

09:16.123 --> 09:16.955
- Enough.

09:16.957 --> 09:18.757
- She's unbearable, man.

09:18.759 --> 09:20.225
- So Harold, Anne tells
me that you're starting

09:20.227 --> 09:22.761
a new project at
working or something?

09:22.763 --> 09:24.696
- Yeah, it's...

09:24.698 --> 09:26.831
Well, it's not that
big of a deal but

09:26.833 --> 09:29.968
it's a promotion and
a little more pay.

09:29.970 --> 09:32.103
A lot more hours.

09:32.105 --> 09:33.872
But it's good.

09:33.874 --> 09:35.073
- Neil, no more, okay?

09:35.075 --> 09:36.641
We really should be going.

09:36.643 --> 09:40.712
- Honey, you're the
designated driver, remember?

09:41.814 --> 09:42.714
- Oh yeah.

09:45.585 --> 09:48.086
- Maybe you two
should just spend the night.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.754
- What?

09:49.756 --> 09:52.691
In some house where some
angry wife killed her husband?

09:52.693 --> 09:54.125
- A story you made
up, by the way.

09:54.127 --> 09:56.194
- It's a true story
and it happened here.

09:56.196 --> 09:56.194
- That's okay.

09:56.196 --> 10:00.865
I haven't unpacked the
butcher knives yet.

10:05.806 --> 10:07.205
- Psycho.

10:25.091 --> 10:27.225
- Why did Emma marry that guy?

10:29.863 --> 10:31.329
He's such a jerk.

10:34.300 --> 10:36.701
- Hey, why did you marry me?

10:37.703 --> 10:37.702
I mean, I'm sure
your mother gave you

10:37.704 --> 10:40.705
an extensive list
detailing the reasons

10:40.707 --> 10:43.708
why you shouldn't
marry me and...

10:44.844 --> 10:46.244
- Anne, stop it.

10:48.748 --> 10:50.415
You gotta get these ideas
of her not liking you

10:50.417 --> 10:51.883
out of your head.

10:53.386 --> 10:55.754
She knows I love you.

10:55.756 --> 10:56.955
Because of that,

10:57.957 --> 10:59.190
she loves you.

11:00.026 --> 11:01.960
You just gotta try harder.

11:01.962 --> 11:01.960
- Me?

11:01.962 --> 11:03.895
You want me to try harder?

11:03.897 --> 11:03.895
- Mhm.

11:03.897 --> 11:07.032
- Harold, your mom hates me.

11:07.034 --> 11:10.168
And the reason why we moved
here is because of your mom.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.236
- You picked this house.

11:11.238 --> 11:11.236
You wanted this house.

11:11.238 --> 11:15.240
- Yeah, to get away from her.

11:15.242 --> 11:17.142
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11:17.144 --> 11:19.044
I don't want to fight.

11:19.945 --> 11:23.381
This is our first
night in our new house.

11:23.383 --> 11:24.282
Please?

11:26.218 --> 11:27.118
- Okay.

11:30.956 --> 11:35.193
- So our first night in the
new house and all we have is.

11:36.195 --> 11:37.696
- Neil's story.

11:38.431 --> 11:39.731
- Yeah.

11:40.900 --> 11:42.434
- Is is true?

11:42.436 --> 11:45.136
Was somebody actually
killed in this house?

11:45.138 --> 11:46.204
In this bed?

11:47.740 --> 11:48.840
- No.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.142
No.

11:51.144 --> 11:52.410
I even checked the
public service records.

11:52.412 --> 11:54.479
There's nothing.

11:54.481 --> 11:56.247
It's just a story.

11:58.184 --> 11:59.084
Okay?

12:00.920 --> 12:01.820
- Okay.

12:03.756 --> 12:04.723
- Okay.
- Okay.

12:07.761 --> 12:09.427
- I'm just really sick
of you making my friends

12:09.429 --> 12:11.730
feel so uncomfortable.

12:11.732 --> 12:13.898
- Babe, it was just a joke.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.200
- Well, it was a bad joke.

12:15.202 --> 12:18.169
- Well, whatever,
why would I care?

12:22.342 --> 12:24.776
- You know, if
you need anything.

12:24.778 --> 12:26.177
- I know, you're
just a few minutes away.

12:26.179 --> 12:29.180
- Yeah, well when we
get back from Maui.

12:29.182 --> 12:30.148
Well, thank you.

12:30.150 --> 12:31.850
- Oh, no problem.

12:43.963 --> 12:46.931
- God, it's about freakin' time.

12:46.933 --> 12:49.267
- I have to get to the office.

12:49.269 --> 12:52.303
The commute, it's gonna
be a long day, long night.

12:52.305 --> 12:53.371
- Okay.

12:53.373 --> 12:54.205
- I'll miss you.

12:54.207 --> 12:56.107
- I'll miss you too.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.409
I love you.
- Love you too.

15:42.207 --> 15:43.174
- Oh, shit.

22:23.709 --> 22:24.608
Hello?

22:27.012 --> 22:28.913
Is someone downstairs?

23:07.853 --> 23:09.387
No, no, no, no.

23:10.589 --> 23:12.690
Please no, no, no, no.

23:13.692 --> 23:15.659
It's all in your head.

23:15.661 --> 23:17.428
It's all in your head.

23:17.430 --> 23:19.797
It's all in your head.

23:43.054 --> 23:44.889
We talked about this.

23:47.159 --> 23:50.628
- Babe, we got the house,
we're out of the city.

23:50.630 --> 23:53.497
It'd just be a really
good spot to raise a kid.

23:53.499 --> 23:54.865
- Harold, not yet.

23:56.568 --> 23:57.468
Please.

23:58.670 --> 23:59.970
- I don't get it.

23:59.972 --> 24:01.672
I mean, it's not like
you have a career.

24:01.674 --> 24:03.607
- I don't have a career?

24:03.609 --> 24:05.209
Harold, your car?

24:05.211 --> 24:08.479
The last calendar shoot
paid for your car.

24:08.481 --> 24:10.214
And the down payment
on this house.

24:10.216 --> 24:11.549
- I'm sorry.

24:11.551 --> 24:12.716
I misspoke.

24:13.919 --> 24:15.953
I didn't mean to say
it like that I just,

24:15.955 --> 24:17.488
you don't have a typical job.

24:17.490 --> 24:19.723
You don't have to go to an
office from nine to five

24:19.725 --> 24:21.625
and you don't have a commute.

24:21.627 --> 24:24.628
You're just at
the house all day.

24:26.231 --> 24:29.967
And I just really,
really, really want kids.

24:32.003 --> 24:32.903
- So do I.

24:36.641 --> 24:38.943
Did you speak to your mom?

24:38.945 --> 24:39.844
- No, why?

24:39.846 --> 24:41.579
- Don't lie to me.

24:41.581 --> 24:43.747
She spoke to you
again, didn't she?

24:43.749 --> 24:45.015
- Anne, it's not crazy.

24:45.017 --> 24:46.750
She wants grandkids.

24:47.719 --> 24:48.986
And with last year's scare.

24:48.988 --> 24:50.488
- Scare?

24:50.490 --> 24:51.589
- She was in the hospital, Anne.

24:51.591 --> 24:51.589
- Yeah, she was in the hospital

24:51.591 --> 24:55.826
because she had an infection
from a Botox injection.

24:55.828 --> 24:59.029
- The point is, she's
not the only one.

24:59.031 --> 25:02.666
I don't want to be 50 and
my son be in kindergarten.

25:02.668 --> 25:04.802
I want to go out there and
throw the football with him.

25:04.804 --> 25:07.738
I don't wanna throw out my back.

25:08.607 --> 25:10.741
I really, really want this.

25:12.744 --> 25:14.512
I need this, Anne.

25:15.247 --> 25:16.146
- I know.

25:17.649 --> 25:19.650
I hear you, okay?

25:19.652 --> 25:21.552
Just next year.

25:21.554 --> 25:22.653
I promise.

25:23.622 --> 25:25.289
- You promise promise?

25:25.291 --> 25:28.626
I promise promise.

27:24.409 --> 27:26.410
- I mean, it's
just really weird.

27:26.412 --> 27:27.411
Why wouldn't you
put the light switch

27:27.413 --> 27:29.013
inside a closet?

27:31.416 --> 27:35.419
- I don't know, maybe it
was just an afterthought.

27:35.421 --> 27:37.321
Baby, you always do this.

27:37.323 --> 27:40.758
You overanalyze and you
overthink everything.

27:40.760 --> 27:44.028
Just let it go, it's
not that big of a deal.

27:44.030 --> 27:45.162
- Yeah, but I mean, what
about the other things

27:45.164 --> 27:47.264
that were moved,
like the furniture?

27:47.266 --> 27:49.199
- We're just stressed out.

27:49.201 --> 27:51.435
It's a new house,

27:51.437 --> 27:54.405
you just finished a huge
photo shoot with Duncan.

27:54.407 --> 27:57.274
You know how you
get on photo shoots.

27:57.276 --> 28:00.177
You're not getting
a lot of sleep.

28:01.746 --> 28:02.846
- I know.

28:04.749 --> 28:08.218
- We both know ghosts
aren't real, right?

28:10.321 --> 28:11.221
- Right.

28:14.325 --> 28:15.726
How was your day?

28:15.728 --> 28:17.061
Was the commute better?

28:17.063 --> 28:19.163
- Yeah, I mean no.

28:19.165 --> 28:22.466
It's a little bit
longer but it's okay.

28:23.468 --> 28:26.403
It was a long day at
the office though.

28:26.405 --> 28:28.872
I'm getting pretty tired.

28:28.874 --> 28:31.108
Maybe we should go to bed.

28:34.479 --> 28:35.479
- Really?

28:35.481 --> 28:36.780
- Yeah.

28:38.750 --> 28:39.450
Come here.

28:59.771 --> 29:00.471
Upstairs.

29:24.863 --> 29:25.763
- Babe.

30:40.872 --> 30:41.572
Harold!

30:42.473 --> 30:43.574
Harold!

30:43.576 --> 30:45.442
Harold, please!

30:45.444 --> 30:46.877
Harold!

31:06.998 --> 31:09.499
Neil and your stupid stories.

32:14.599 --> 32:16.066
- Hey.

32:16.068 --> 32:17.534
How are you?

32:17.536 --> 32:19.202
- I'm fine.

32:19.204 --> 32:22.205
I'm sorry, just a new house

32:22.207 --> 32:24.574
and Neil's stupid story and...

32:25.977 --> 32:29.513
It's probably
just too much pizza and wine.

32:29.515 --> 32:30.714
I'm fine.

32:30.716 --> 32:31.615
- Good.

32:33.151 --> 32:36.586
Those boxes, do you think
you could take 'em out?

32:36.588 --> 32:38.422
Out to the barn?

32:38.424 --> 32:38.422
- Yeah.

32:38.424 --> 32:40.624
- I mean, if
you're not doing anything.

32:40.626 --> 32:42.659
- No, it's fine, I got it.

32:42.661 --> 32:45.429
- I just, I come home
at 12:00 am and it's just.

32:45.431 --> 32:46.530
- Yeah, I know.

32:46.532 --> 32:47.464
I know, I can do it.

32:47.466 --> 32:48.966
- Okay.

32:48.968 --> 32:49.733
Gonna walk me out?

32:49.735 --> 32:51.168
- Yeah.
- Okay.

33:28.740 --> 33:30.607
- Bored, really?

33:32.211 --> 33:33.610
Drive two hours.

33:35.513 --> 33:38.115
Spend 12 hours trying
to impress the boss

33:38.117 --> 33:40.183
because I'm a company man.

33:40.185 --> 33:43.120
Then I get to come
home to a loving wife

33:43.122 --> 33:45.589
that does not want kids.

33:45.591 --> 33:48.392
And apparently is
seeing a ghost.

33:49.660 --> 33:52.029
Must be nice being bored.

34:49.822 --> 34:52.155
- Harold, you should really
just audio books or...

34:52.157 --> 34:52.822
Emma!

34:52.824 --> 34:55.525
Hey, how how are you?

34:55.527 --> 34:57.327
Yeah, you all packed?

34:58.596 --> 34:59.496
Aw.

34:59.498 --> 35:03.433
I know, I really wish we
could go with you guys but

35:03.435 --> 35:07.671
Harold has a huge project so
yeah, it's not gonna work out.

35:09.807 --> 35:13.210
Hey, Emma, can i
ask you something?

35:13.212 --> 35:14.644
Do you hear noises?

35:18.217 --> 35:20.517
No, I know, I just.

35:20.519 --> 35:23.620
Maybe it was just this old
house that needs to be updated.

35:23.622 --> 35:25.589
But I brought it up to Harold

35:25.591 --> 35:29.659
and we got in this
huge argument and...

35:29.661 --> 35:32.596
Yeah, no we're fine
it's just that he said

35:32.598 --> 35:35.165
photography isn't a...

35:39.403 --> 35:43.640
I'm sorry, yeah he said
photography isn't a career.

35:45.409 --> 35:48.745
Yeah, and then he brought up
the whole kids thing again.

35:48.747 --> 35:52.716
No, yeah, you know, I do
want kids it's just that

35:52.718 --> 35:54.518
I want to make sure
it's what we want

35:54.520 --> 35:58.822
and not something that his
mom is pushing, you know?

35:58.824 --> 35:59.723
Yeah.

36:02.894 --> 36:07.564
Hey, okay this is a
stupid question again but,

36:07.566 --> 36:09.166
was there really a woman

36:09.168 --> 36:12.302
that killed her
husband in this house?

36:12.304 --> 36:16.540
I know, it's Neil.

36:16.542 --> 36:18.808
Where did you find
that guy anyway?

36:18.810 --> 36:20.410
I hope you have a great trip.

36:20.412 --> 36:21.878
Well, I'll let you
go and get packed

36:21.880 --> 36:24.481
and have a safe trip to Hawaii.

36:24.483 --> 36:25.715
I love you too.

38:40.584 --> 38:42.452
Babe, it's so late.

38:43.888 --> 38:44.788
- I know.

38:46.023 --> 38:48.525
It's probably gonna be
like this every night

38:48.527 --> 38:50.760
until the project is done.

38:54.699 --> 38:55.999
- Is it worth it?

38:58.769 --> 39:00.670
- What'd you say?

39:00.672 --> 39:01.938
- Is it worth it?

39:03.007 --> 39:04.741
- Yeah, it's worth it.

39:04.743 --> 39:06.876
Of course it's worth it.

39:06.878 --> 39:08.511
I mean, a it shows Mr. Jones

39:08.513 --> 39:10.613
I can handle an
executive level account

39:10.615 --> 39:14.084
and b it's that much
closer to the promotion.

39:14.086 --> 39:17.020
Which means a lot of money.

39:17.022 --> 39:19.622
- Yeah, but it's just money.

39:20.825 --> 39:22.792
- It's just money.

39:22.794 --> 39:25.528
Well, you need to
understand that just because

39:25.530 --> 39:27.097
my family comes from money

39:27.099 --> 39:29.065
does not mean it didn't
take a lot of hard work

39:29.067 --> 39:29.065
and sacrifice.

39:29.067 --> 39:32.001
My dad worked his ass
off for his family.

39:32.003 --> 39:33.737
- Yeah, and he died
of a heart attack.

39:33.739 --> 39:36.039
- He died from a heart
attack from his lifestyle,

39:36.041 --> 39:38.375
not his work load.

39:38.377 --> 39:40.410
You wanted this house
and I'm trying my hardest

39:40.412 --> 39:41.644
to make sure that happens.

39:41.646 --> 39:43.913
- No, we wanted this house.

39:43.915 --> 39:45.582
- My point is that
I'm in the office

39:45.584 --> 39:46.916
12 hours a day.

39:48.753 --> 39:50.653
Not for me, for us.

39:50.655 --> 39:53.790
I work my ass off for us
because I need to provide, Anne.

39:53.792 --> 39:56.393
I have to provide, do
you understand that?

39:56.395 --> 40:00.730
- I'm sorry, it's just
that I'm so lonely here.

40:00.732 --> 40:04.968
Okay, I'm here all day by
myself in this big house and...

40:08.139 --> 40:10.707
You know, one of the things
that I love about you

40:10.709 --> 40:12.742
is that you are like your father

40:12.744 --> 40:16.646
and that you do make
sacrifices for your wife.

40:17.748 --> 40:19.749
And your future family.

40:21.685 --> 40:22.585
I'm sorry.

40:29.660 --> 40:30.727
- Thank you.

41:37.194 --> 41:38.094
- Hello?

41:40.164 --> 41:41.231
Who are you?

44:05.109 --> 44:06.409
Hey!

44:06.411 --> 44:07.744
Who are you?!

45:00.698 --> 45:04.167
- Ah.

45:04.169 --> 45:05.001
Shit!

45:05.003 --> 45:06.369
Holy shit, Anne!

45:06.371 --> 45:08.204
What are you doing?

45:08.206 --> 45:09.906
What the fuck is that?

45:09.908 --> 45:10.873
Anne!

45:10.875 --> 45:11.941
Anne!

45:11.943 --> 45:13.443
Put the knife down.

45:13.445 --> 45:15.078
Put the knife down!

45:15.946 --> 45:16.846
Holy shit!

45:19.016 --> 45:21.417
What the fuck are you doing?

45:24.354 --> 45:25.722
What is this?

45:26.390 --> 45:26.389
Where'd you find this?
- I'm sorry.

45:26.391 --> 45:28.825
- Anne, where
did you find this?

45:28.827 --> 45:32.195
- I'm sorry!
- What are you doing?

45:32.197 --> 45:33.496
You don't know?

45:34.498 --> 45:37.467
- It was just in my hand,
i don't know what it is.

45:37.469 --> 45:39.335
- Fuck, Anne!

45:39.337 --> 45:41.437
You can't answer me, you
don't know where you've been.

45:41.439 --> 45:43.506
You're trying to stab
me while I'm sleeping.

45:43.508 --> 45:46.375
- I'm sorry.

45:46.377 --> 45:47.777
- Are you, fuck!

45:49.046 --> 45:49.946
- Harold.

45:51.115 --> 45:52.148
Harold.

45:52.150 --> 45:53.216
Harold.

45:53.218 --> 45:55.051
Harold, I'm so sorry.

46:10.267 --> 46:12.802
- Anne, you scared
the shit outta me.

46:12.804 --> 46:15.772
- How many times do I have
to tell you that I'm sorry?

46:15.774 --> 46:18.474
- I didn't know that I had
the knife in my hand and...

46:18.476 --> 46:19.475
She led me.

46:21.812 --> 46:26.048
- I am so tired of going
over this again and again.

46:28.452 --> 46:29.886
I got less than four
hours to go to bed,

46:29.888 --> 46:31.354
there's no way I'm going to bed.

46:31.356 --> 46:35.258
Might as well just
go to work right now.

46:35.260 --> 46:36.325
- I'm sorry.

46:40.264 --> 46:42.865
- You know, if you don't
like this house just tell me.

46:42.867 --> 46:44.267
I'll understand.

46:45.469 --> 46:47.570
What I'm not gonna
understand is this:

46:47.572 --> 46:49.305
You playing games.

46:49.307 --> 46:50.406
- You know what?

46:50.408 --> 46:51.841
I'm not sorry.

46:51.843 --> 46:55.411
You never believe me so why
should I expect you to change?

46:55.413 --> 46:55.411
- Okay.

46:55.413 --> 46:58.948
Well, I believed you
when you told me that

46:58.950 --> 47:00.316
someone stole your lenses.

47:00.318 --> 47:00.316
- They did.

47:00.318 --> 47:05.054
- Well, your assistant found
them in the laundry room.

47:05.056 --> 47:07.089
And I believed you

47:07.091 --> 47:09.225
when you said you lost
your engagement ring.

47:09.227 --> 47:10.126
- It was stolen.

47:10.128 --> 47:10.126
- Yeah, about that.

47:10.128 --> 47:14.197
My mom found it in
your jewelry box.

47:16.900 --> 47:20.102
- I saw a ghost or something.

47:20.104 --> 47:20.102
From Neil's story,

47:20.104 --> 47:25.341
the woman who murdered
her husband in this house?

47:25.343 --> 47:27.210
I mean, maybe she wants
my help or something.

47:27.212 --> 47:28.411
- Okay, listen!

47:28.413 --> 47:30.213
I want you to
listen to me, okay?

47:30.215 --> 47:32.248
And listen good.

47:32.250 --> 47:34.317
If Neil's story was true

47:35.185 --> 47:39.322
and this ghost needed
your help, why, why?

47:39.324 --> 47:42.225
That doesn't make
any sense to me.

47:53.437 --> 47:54.537
I'm sorry.

47:56.473 --> 47:57.573
I'm sorry.

47:59.910 --> 48:00.610
I'm tired.

48:00.612 --> 48:05.314
And all I want to do is go
upstairs, take a shower,

48:05.316 --> 48:07.383
regroup and get to work.

48:09.086 --> 48:10.453
- Well, it's still early,

48:10.455 --> 48:11.420
why don't we just
go back to bed?

48:11.422 --> 48:12.989
- No, no, no, if I go to work

48:12.991 --> 48:14.557
then I'll get there
before anyone else does,

48:14.559 --> 48:17.560
I'll finish that project
and I'll get to leave early.

48:17.562 --> 48:19.996
Then see you sooner.

48:19.998 --> 48:21.631
That's good, right?

48:22.532 --> 48:23.666
- Yeah.

48:23.668 --> 48:24.567
- Yeah.

48:56.600 --> 49:00.036
I need to start doing
this more often.

49:00.038 --> 49:03.005
I mean, I hit no traffic today.

49:03.007 --> 49:07.176
- Yeah, and that way we
can have dinner together.

49:08.378 --> 49:10.279
- So how was your day?

49:11.448 --> 49:13.015
- It was fine.

49:13.017 --> 49:13.716
Just fine.

49:19.189 --> 49:22.358
- Well I'm starving and
this looks delicious.

49:22.360 --> 49:23.259
- Me too.

49:25.262 --> 49:26.996
Hey, um, forgive me?

49:29.232 --> 49:31.600
- For what?

49:31.602 --> 49:34.170
- Last night and this morning.

49:35.405 --> 49:38.474
Ghosts.

49:39.710 --> 49:44.146
- Listen, if it makes you
cook my favorite dinner.

49:45.082 --> 49:47.616
And makes you dress
like that every night,

49:47.618 --> 49:49.752
then baby, you can keep
seeing whatever it is

49:49.754 --> 49:52.455
that you think you're seeing.

49:54.591 --> 49:56.492
- I'm gonna go get the wine.

49:56.494 --> 49:57.326
- I'll get it.

49:57.328 --> 49:58.227
- Oh, no.

50:21.051 --> 50:22.618
- To our new lives.

50:24.455 --> 50:25.354
Cheers.

50:29.559 --> 50:30.659
- No.

50:30.661 --> 50:31.560
No, please.

50:31.562 --> 50:32.661
Not again.

50:42.639 --> 50:44.607
Please, leave me alone!

51:59.484 --> 52:00.749
- Anne, Anne, look at me.

52:00.751 --> 52:03.185
Baby, look at me, look at me.

52:03.187 --> 52:04.553
It's okay.

52:04.555 --> 52:07.423
You were out for pretty
much the entire day.

52:07.425 --> 52:11.393
I called Dr. chambers,
you remember him, right?

52:14.331 --> 52:14.330
- Anne,

52:16.466 --> 52:18.834
can you tell me what happened?

52:20.403 --> 52:21.303
- I, um...

52:21.305 --> 52:26.675
I saw a ghost and I followed
her out into the woods and...

52:29.146 --> 52:32.214
I thought she was
trying to kill me.

52:34.384 --> 52:35.451
- Alright.

52:35.453 --> 52:37.186
From what you've told me

52:37.188 --> 52:39.622
about the stress of
moving into a new house,

52:39.624 --> 52:41.490
the ridiculous story of
a murder by your friend

52:41.492 --> 52:44.260
and possible marital problems.

52:45.529 --> 52:47.530
Look my dear, what
your husband told you

52:47.532 --> 52:50.533
about ghosts not
being real is true.

52:50.535 --> 52:54.770
That story by Neil about
the murder, didn't happen.

52:56.273 --> 52:59.775
I know the mind can
be very persuasive.

52:59.777 --> 53:01.477
Anne, there's no
reason to be alarmed,

53:01.479 --> 53:03.479
this is not a lasting condition.

53:03.481 --> 53:05.214
- Condition?

53:05.216 --> 53:08.551
- Now, if I thought that
the ghost you were seeing

53:08.553 --> 53:10.486
were individuals
of people you knew

53:10.488 --> 53:13.322
and you were possibly involved
in some sort of violence

53:13.324 --> 53:17.960
in some way or vice versa,
then I would be concerned.

53:17.962 --> 53:22.431
You see, psychological disorders
usually manifest themselves

53:22.433 --> 53:24.366
in a patient when
they see themselves

53:24.368 --> 53:25.868
exerting control and power,

53:25.870 --> 53:27.870
usually displayed in
the form of violence

53:27.872 --> 53:31.473
over an adversary,
someone they dislike.

53:32.475 --> 53:34.743
Now, this ghost that you saw.

53:36.513 --> 53:38.514
Was it someone you knew?

53:38.516 --> 53:39.615
- No.

53:40.584 --> 53:42.618
- A former boyfriend?

53:42.620 --> 53:44.386
A former employer?

53:45.555 --> 53:46.488
Your mother-in-law?

53:46.490 --> 53:47.389
- No!

53:48.692 --> 53:50.526
- That's it then.

53:50.528 --> 53:53.696
I'm gonna prescribe
a mild sedative.

53:53.698 --> 53:55.864
And this will help
you get some rest,

53:55.866 --> 53:57.499
get some sleep.

53:57.501 --> 54:00.002
You know, and get you better.

54:02.405 --> 54:04.940
Look, dreams can seem very real.

54:06.276 --> 54:08.644
That's why in the rare occasion

54:08.646 --> 54:11.647
when somebody's
dreaming and they fall,

54:11.649 --> 54:13.749
they can actually die.

54:14.618 --> 54:18.254
But I know that transferring
the blame may help

54:18.256 --> 54:20.256
but ghosts aren't real.

54:22.492 --> 54:25.794
My point is that sometimes
dreams and visions,

54:25.796 --> 54:30.299
they're just that, they're
dreams and visions.

54:30.301 --> 54:30.299
Alright?

54:30.301 --> 54:34.436
So, this sedative will
help diminish the stress

54:34.438 --> 54:36.538
and diminish the feeling
that these dreams

54:36.540 --> 54:38.374
and visions are real.

54:40.844 --> 54:40.843
You'll be fine.

54:40.845 --> 54:43.679
- Do you
have any questions?

54:43.681 --> 54:44.580
- No.

54:45.849 --> 54:47.449
- Get some rest.

54:48.018 --> 54:51.387
- Thank you doctor.
- She'll be fine.

54:54.057 --> 54:55.658
- They are real.

55:00.430 --> 55:02.798
Harold, why don't you belie...

55:06.403 --> 55:07.703
Why is your mother here?

55:07.705 --> 55:09.805
- Babe, she's here to help.

55:09.807 --> 55:12.775
- We saved you some supper.

55:12.777 --> 55:14.677
Harold's favorite.

55:14.679 --> 55:17.446
Meatloaf with mashed potatoes.

55:29.793 --> 55:31.627
- Yeah, hi Mr. Jones.

55:32.629 --> 55:34.663
Yeah, I know what time it is.

55:34.665 --> 55:36.532
But it's important.

55:37.867 --> 55:42.104
Well, my wife Anne, she
stumbled and hit her head and...

55:44.007 --> 55:47.443
No, she's okay, I took
her to a doctor but

55:47.445 --> 55:51.680
he wants her to stay home
just in case she's concussed.

55:53.550 --> 55:57.052
No, I think she'll
be fine but um,

55:57.054 --> 56:01.790
I guess the reason I'm
calling you is because I'm...

56:01.792 --> 56:06.028
I'm not gonna be able to
make that 10 o'clock meeting.

56:09.999 --> 56:10.899
Yeah.

56:10.901 --> 56:16.372
No, I mean, I know, I'm the one
that set it up but I just...

56:21.444 --> 56:23.879
Yeah, Mr. Jones, i
completely understand.

56:23.881 --> 56:26.615
I get how important it is and...

56:30.086 --> 56:30.986
Yeah.

56:32.622 --> 56:33.856
No, this is...

56:36.726 --> 56:41.597
Right, and no I do love
working there at the office and

56:41.599 --> 56:45.000
you can definitely
count on me I just...

56:46.669 --> 56:48.404
Right.

56:48.406 --> 56:49.538
I understand.

56:51.641 --> 56:52.741
Okay.

56:55.512 --> 56:56.578
Sounds good.

56:57.614 --> 56:59.615
Talk to you then.

56:59.617 --> 57:00.716
Fuck.

57:08.992 --> 57:09.958
- Hey babe.

57:09.960 --> 57:13.829
You know that guy that
found me in the woods?

57:13.831 --> 57:15.597
- Yeah.

57:15.599 --> 57:18.167
- Do you think you could ask
him to come out here tomorrow?

57:18.169 --> 57:20.068
Tell me what happened?

57:23.940 --> 57:25.974
- Do you think that'll help?

57:25.976 --> 57:26.875
- Yeah.

57:29.846 --> 57:33.048
- Yeah, I'll make
the call tomorrow.

57:33.050 --> 57:34.750
- Thank you.

58:23.700 --> 58:25.100
- Hey honey, hi.

58:26.603 --> 58:30.539
This is Doug, he's the one
that found you in the woods.

58:30.541 --> 58:31.607
- Nice to meet ya.

58:31.609 --> 58:33.542
This is my son here.

58:34.544 --> 58:36.144
- Thank you so much.

58:36.146 --> 58:36.144
- You're welcome.

58:36.146 --> 58:40.048
- Harold, the
weather's getting bad.

58:45.889 --> 58:48.891
- Can you show me
where you found me?

58:48.893 --> 58:51.093
- Well, yes ma'am, of course.

58:51.095 --> 58:52.728
You stay here.

58:52.730 --> 58:53.829
Right this way.

59:05.875 --> 59:06.875
- You know,

59:06.877 --> 59:09.578
we really should
have her committed.

59:09.580 --> 59:10.879
- Mom, I don't.

59:12.115 --> 59:13.282
- Just for observation.

59:13.284 --> 59:13.282
Think about it.

59:16.119 --> 59:20.289
We really want to do what's
best for Anne, don't we?

59:20.291 --> 59:22.591
- I have to go to work.

59:22.593 --> 59:24.026
- Maybe it's not proper for her

59:24.028 --> 59:27.062
to go out in the woods
with another man.

59:27.064 --> 59:27.896
- Mom, I love you.

59:27.898 --> 59:29.598
- I love you too.

59:48.351 --> 59:51.587
- So, what were you doing on
the day that you found me?

59:51.589 --> 59:54.256
- Oh, well I was
actually hunting deer.

59:54.258 --> 59:54.256
- Really?

59:54.258 --> 59:54.256
I didn't know it
was hunting season.

59:54.258 --> 59:59.194
- Oh no, ma'am, I have a
license to hunt all year 'round.

59:59.196 --> 01:00:01.663
I could show you if you like.

01:00:02.632 --> 01:00:05.100
Well, you were right here,
this is where I found ya.

01:00:05.102 --> 01:00:07.269
You were in a real bad way.

01:00:07.271 --> 01:00:09.304
- What do you mean, bad way?

01:00:09.306 --> 01:00:11.840
- Well, your face was
pale, your body was cold.

01:00:11.842 --> 01:00:13.909
I thought you were dead.

01:00:15.244 --> 01:00:18.614
I didn't do
anything ma'am, I promise.

01:00:18.616 --> 01:00:21.350
I just checked your pulse and...

01:00:35.298 --> 01:00:36.698
- She's a tramp.

01:00:37.367 --> 01:00:40.736
She's nothing but
a god damn tramp.

01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:46.408
- Well, I hope to never see
ya out there again like that.

01:00:46.410 --> 01:00:47.643
It was nice to meet ya.

01:00:47.645 --> 01:00:49.811
- Thanks, you too.

01:00:56.386 --> 01:00:58.420
- I need to go to the store.

01:00:58.422 --> 01:01:01.423
You don't have one percent milk.

01:01:01.425 --> 01:01:05.227
Harold has to have
one percent milk.

01:01:05.229 --> 01:01:07.229
And there are evidently
a few other things

01:01:07.231 --> 01:01:09.398
that you don't
think that he needs.

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:09.398
- Martha, i--

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:12.067
- now, I'll be gone for an hour.

01:01:12.069 --> 01:01:15.003
Do you think you can keep
from going completely bonkers

01:01:15.005 --> 01:01:16.138
for one hour?

01:01:18.007 --> 01:01:18.907
Answer me.

01:01:20.743 --> 01:01:22.711
Are you a monkey?

01:01:22.713 --> 01:01:24.946
It's a yes or no question.

01:01:26.082 --> 01:01:27.783
- I will be fine.

01:01:54.077 --> 01:01:55.744
This is my house!

01:02:35.952 --> 01:02:36.852
Come on.

01:02:38.521 --> 01:02:39.821
Okay.

01:02:42.358 --> 01:02:46.094
Pick up, pick up, pick
up, pick up, pick up.

01:02:47.797 --> 01:02:48.530
God damn it!

01:03:07.283 --> 01:03:09.317
Hi, yes this is Mrs. Harris,

01:03:09.319 --> 01:03:12.454
may I speak with Harold please?

01:03:12.456 --> 01:03:14.456
No, this is really
important, please.

01:03:14.458 --> 01:03:15.557
Thank you.

01:03:17.794 --> 01:03:19.094
Hi Harold, please.

01:03:19.096 --> 01:03:20.162
Please, there's
somebody in this house.

01:03:20.164 --> 01:03:21.863
You need to come home.

01:03:21.865 --> 01:03:22.998
No, she left!

01:03:24.167 --> 01:03:25.867
Harold, please.

01:03:25.869 --> 01:03:28.436
Please, Harold,
please just come here.

01:03:28.438 --> 01:03:29.538
Please.

01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:31.439
Okay.

01:03:38.848 --> 01:03:39.581
- Anne!

01:03:39.583 --> 01:03:40.482
Mom!

01:03:45.555 --> 01:03:46.454
Anne!

01:03:46.456 --> 01:03:48.423
Oh, thank god.

01:03:48.425 --> 01:03:48.423
What's going on?

01:03:48.425 --> 01:03:52.260
I just hauled ass all
the way from the office.

01:03:52.262 --> 01:03:53.361
- Harold, we need
to get out of here.

01:03:53.363 --> 01:03:54.496
- Why are all these bags out?

01:03:54.498 --> 01:03:56.464
- We need to leave,
it's not safe.

01:03:56.466 --> 01:03:57.499
- Where are we gonna go?

01:03:57.501 --> 01:03:57.499
What are you talking about?

01:03:57.501 --> 01:04:00.268
- I don't know.
- Where's mom?

01:04:00.270 --> 01:04:01.269
- She left.

01:04:01.271 --> 01:04:05.006
- Why are you packing,
what are these bags?

01:04:05.008 --> 01:04:07.275
- Harold, it is not
safe here, okay, please?

01:04:07.277 --> 01:04:08.343
- Where are we gonna go?

01:04:08.345 --> 01:04:08.343
- I don't know.

01:04:08.345 --> 01:04:13.048
But baby, this house, there's
something really wrong here

01:04:13.050 --> 01:04:14.583
and you need to trust me.

01:04:14.585 --> 01:04:15.483
Please.

01:04:18.321 --> 01:04:19.221
- Okay.

01:04:20.423 --> 01:04:21.523
Okay.

01:04:22.592 --> 01:04:25.493
Just grab that and
I'll grab this.

01:04:33.502 --> 01:04:35.170
- Harold hurry, come on.

01:05:03.634 --> 01:05:05.300
- Okay, hold on.

01:05:05.302 --> 01:05:05.300
- What is going on?

01:05:05.302 --> 01:05:08.370
- I don't know, it's
just not starting.

01:05:08.372 --> 01:05:10.171
I don't know what's
going on with it.

01:05:10.173 --> 01:05:10.171
- We have to go.

01:05:10.173 --> 01:05:12.407
- Fuck, I can't
go anywhere, Anne.

01:05:12.409 --> 01:05:13.508
It won't start.

01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:15.577
Just calm down, just...

01:05:15.579 --> 01:05:16.478
Fuck.

01:05:19.382 --> 01:05:20.615
My mom's here.

01:05:29.425 --> 01:05:29.424
- Harold, honey--

01:05:29.426 --> 01:05:32.627
- mom, you were not
supposed to leave Anne!

01:05:32.629 --> 01:05:34.562
- I was only gone for
just a few minutes.

01:05:34.564 --> 01:05:37.599
- She called me in a panic,
i left the office early.

01:05:37.601 --> 01:05:39.434
I didn't even tell Mr. Jones.

01:05:39.436 --> 01:05:40.535
Now my car won't start!

01:05:40.537 --> 01:05:42.137
- It'll be fine.

01:05:42.972 --> 01:05:44.439
Anne and I will
have a nice talk,

01:05:44.441 --> 01:05:47.275
I'll fix her a glass of tea and

01:05:48.144 --> 01:05:49.678
you need to get on back to work.

01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:51.680
I'll tell ya, you
need to keep your job

01:05:51.682 --> 01:05:55.050
and thank goodness Mrs.
Jones and I are good friends.

01:05:55.052 --> 01:05:56.184
- Mom, my car won't start.

01:05:56.186 --> 01:05:58.219
- Here, take my car.

01:05:58.221 --> 01:05:59.721
It's gonna be okay, okay?

01:05:59.723 --> 01:06:00.622
- Alright.

01:06:02.291 --> 01:06:05.193
Just talk to Anne please.
- I will.

01:06:08.197 --> 01:06:09.564
If you don't get out of this car

01:06:09.566 --> 01:06:14.002
and march up to that house
right now, I'll kill you!

01:06:29.518 --> 01:06:31.586
- Anne, sit down.

01:06:31.588 --> 01:06:32.587
Look at me.

01:06:33.656 --> 01:06:35.523
I have to get back to work.

01:06:35.525 --> 01:06:40.128
But mom promised me she's
gonna stay with you.

01:06:40.130 --> 01:06:42.263
Listen, here take this.

01:06:42.265 --> 01:06:43.164
Take that.

01:06:46.502 --> 01:06:47.402
Trust me.

01:06:48.204 --> 01:06:50.538
- You better hurry.

01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:53.575
I'll take good care
of her, I promise.

01:06:56.512 --> 01:06:57.579
- Okay, mom.

01:06:58.581 --> 01:06:58.580
Okay, mom, I just
gave her a pill

01:06:58.582 --> 01:07:03.251
so she's gonna be asleep for
at least a couple of hours.

01:07:03.253 --> 01:07:04.285
- Asleep?

01:07:04.287 --> 01:07:05.487
No, I don't want to go asleep.

01:07:05.489 --> 01:07:06.554
The ghost...

01:07:08.224 --> 01:07:09.791
- Ghost, really?

01:07:09.793 --> 01:07:11.359
Everyone knows
ghosts aren't real.

01:07:11.361 --> 01:07:15.230
I told you before you married
her that she was loony.

01:07:15.232 --> 01:07:18.033
- Mom, I can't do
this right now.

01:07:19.535 --> 01:07:20.635
I'm sorry.

01:07:20.637 --> 01:07:22.604
You might be right.

01:07:22.606 --> 01:07:25.473
Maybe she does have some issues.

01:07:25.475 --> 01:07:27.575
But the point is I need you.

01:07:27.577 --> 01:07:29.144
- You could move.

01:07:29.146 --> 01:07:31.079
I mean, there's a nice
house just two blocks

01:07:31.081 --> 01:07:32.147
from where I live.

01:07:32.149 --> 01:07:33.448
- There's no way I can do that.

01:07:33.450 --> 01:07:35.050
All of my savings I put in

01:07:35.052 --> 01:07:36.451
for a down payment
on this house.

01:07:36.453 --> 01:07:37.619
And with the market
the way it is,

01:07:37.621 --> 01:07:40.755
there's no way I'll
get my money back.

01:07:40.757 --> 01:07:42.524
- I could give you a loan.

01:07:42.526 --> 01:07:43.625
- A loan?

01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:46.461
Why is she here?

01:07:46.463 --> 01:07:47.328
- See?

01:07:47.330 --> 01:07:48.630
She's hallucinating again.

01:07:48.632 --> 01:07:50.598
She doesn't even
remember that I was here.

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:51.633
- Mom, stop.

01:07:51.635 --> 01:07:53.601
I just gave her a pill.

01:07:54.570 --> 01:07:57.305
- I've been here all day, honey.

01:08:05.281 --> 01:08:07.615
- Why can't you stay?

01:08:07.617 --> 01:08:10.618
- Anne, you have got to
stop acting like this.

01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:12.487
I have to go to work
and you know that.

01:08:12.489 --> 01:08:12.487
Look at me.

01:08:12.489 --> 01:08:17.759
Mom's doing us a huge favor
by staying here with you.

01:08:17.761 --> 01:08:19.727
Do you understand that?

01:08:20.830 --> 01:08:21.662
I don't have time for this.

01:08:21.665 --> 01:08:23.598
I have to go to work.

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:25.667
She'll take care of you.

01:08:28.636 --> 01:08:32.707
Mom, please take care of
her because I love her.

01:08:42.685 --> 01:08:43.585
- So...

01:08:46.555 --> 01:08:49.357
My son has gone and
married a crazy bitch

01:08:49.359 --> 01:08:51.658
who thinks she sees ghosts.

01:08:53.696 --> 01:08:55.863
Now it's just you and me.

01:08:57.233 --> 01:08:58.133
All alone.

01:09:01.770 --> 01:09:04.205
I wanna ask you something.

01:09:05.274 --> 01:09:08.176
Why the fuck did
you marry my son?

01:09:09.377 --> 01:09:10.912
Is it for the money?

01:09:12.214 --> 01:09:13.648
No.

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:16.484
He said you had your own money.

01:09:16.486 --> 01:09:20.721
From selling those slutty
calendars of naked women.

01:09:21.790 --> 01:09:24.559
Yeah.

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:26.694
I've seen your work.

01:09:26.696 --> 01:09:29.764
You call yourself
a photographer?

01:09:29.765 --> 01:09:32.399
You're nothing but
a pornographer.

01:09:32.402 --> 01:09:32.399
And you know what?

01:09:32.402 --> 01:09:37.639
You're gonna go to hell,
that's where you're going.

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:39.807
You're afraid of ghosts?

01:09:39.809 --> 01:09:42.510
The only thing you need
to fear around here is me.

01:09:44.314 --> 01:09:45.580
You little tramp.

01:09:46.582 --> 01:09:48.183
I'll kick your ass.

01:09:48.185 --> 01:09:50.551
Trying to take
over my son's life?

01:09:50.554 --> 01:09:53.654
You're nothing but
a little bitch!

01:09:55.391 --> 01:09:56.391
I'll show you.

01:09:58.895 --> 01:10:01.296
- No, there's
a ghost in the closet!

01:10:01.298 --> 01:10:03.331
No!

01:10:03.333 --> 01:10:05.633
- The ghost is in
the closet, eh?

01:10:05.635 --> 01:10:06.734
Okay.

01:10:12.942 --> 01:10:14.375
I'll show you.

01:10:23.486 --> 01:10:26.854
- Let me out!

01:10:38.601 --> 01:10:41.269
When Howard finds out
what you're doing!

01:10:45.976 --> 01:10:47.308
Martha!

01:10:47.310 --> 01:10:49.611
Martha, the ghost is in here!

01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:52.780
Martha!

01:10:55.818 --> 01:10:58.419
- You know what you are?

01:10:58.421 --> 01:10:59.587
You're a whore.

01:10:59.589 --> 01:11:00.888
- Please, Martha!

01:11:00.890 --> 01:11:02.957
Please, the ghost is in here.

01:11:02.959 --> 01:11:04.726
- You're a harlot!

01:11:08.831 --> 01:11:11.566
- The killer is in here, please.

01:11:13.669 --> 01:11:15.770
Please, please, help me, Martha!

01:11:29.519 --> 01:11:31.686
- That ghost's in here!

01:12:02.751 --> 01:12:05.653
- There's no such
thing as ghosts!

01:12:22.771 --> 01:12:23.671
Anne.

01:12:30.946 --> 01:12:32.013
Anne, honey.

01:12:34.917 --> 01:12:36.517
Are you alright?

01:12:41.690 --> 01:12:42.757
You little bitch!

01:12:42.759 --> 01:12:44.592
I'm gonna kill you!

01:12:52.601 --> 01:12:54.569
Where are you?

01:13:42.518 --> 01:13:43.418
- Anne?

01:13:46.455 --> 01:13:47.155
Mom?

01:13:53.495 --> 01:13:54.929
Anne!?

01:13:54.931 --> 01:13:55.830
Mom!

01:13:57.533 --> 01:13:58.633
Anne!?

01:14:02.171 --> 01:14:03.070
Mom?

01:14:31.900 --> 01:14:32.800
Fuck.

01:15:30.726 --> 01:15:33.261
- Can you tell me what happened?

01:15:34.796 --> 01:15:37.198
I know this is a
difficult situation

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:40.535
but I have to ask
you some questions.

01:15:41.770 --> 01:15:45.573
Do you know where
she could've went?

01:15:45.575 --> 01:15:49.043
When was the last time
you saw Mrs. Harris?

01:15:49.878 --> 01:15:53.247
Does she have a history
of mental illness?

01:15:53.249 --> 01:15:55.583
Is she on any medication?
