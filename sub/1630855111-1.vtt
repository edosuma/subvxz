WEBVTT

01:10.250 --> 01:12.375
Ciao, Gregor.

01:17.208 --> 01:19.041
I have Yovanovitch.

01:19.041 --> 01:20.916
<i>Took you
long enough, Nadia.</i>

01:20.916 --> 01:22.458
Missed you, too, Bernard.

01:22.458 --> 01:23.833
Well,
you know, they do say

01:23.833 --> 01:25.666
a year away makes
the heart grow fonder.

01:25.666 --> 01:27.916
Although that didn't happen
with my ex-wife's heart.

01:27.916 --> 01:29.416
Do you know that
she had me living

01:29.416 --> 01:31.250
in a condo in Encinitas
for an entire year?

01:31.250 --> 01:32.458
Do you know where that is?

01:32.458 --> 01:33.833
<i>Encinitas?</i>

01:33.833 --> 01:35.625
- It's good to be back.
- <i>Now, remember,</i>

01:35.625 --> 01:37.833
<i>our intel says that
this shitbag is carrying</i>

01:37.833 --> 01:40.250
highly enriched uranium
in that case

01:40.250 --> 01:43.291
<i>and he's intending to sell it to
any number of nefarious bidders.</i>

01:43.291 --> 01:45.375
I see you left me
a few new toys.

01:45.375 --> 01:46.916
<i>Yes. I built them
for my favorite spy.</i>

01:46.916 --> 01:48.125
Aw.

01:48.125 --> 01:49.875
He hated them,
and I didn't want them

01:49.875 --> 01:51.666
- to go to waste, so...
- Asshole.

01:51.666 --> 01:54.000
<i>The compact can track
a target a mile away.</i>

01:54.000 --> 01:56.500
The perfume is
a localized explosive.

01:56.500 --> 01:57.916
What about the lipstick?

01:57.916 --> 01:59.500
Lipstick.

01:59.500 --> 02:01.958
Nothing more dangerous to
a pervy old man than red lips.

02:01.958 --> 02:03.333
You would know.

02:03.333 --> 02:05.083
Got to go.

02:14.541 --> 02:16.916
Anyone sitting here?

02:20.666 --> 02:22.833
Got kicked out of first class.
They wouldn't let me smoke.

02:22.833 --> 02:25.708
- This is a nonsmoking train.
- Oh, I don't smoke.

02:25.708 --> 02:27.541
I just don't like
being told I can't.

02:27.541 --> 02:29.458
Seat's taken.
I'm waiting for a friend.

02:29.458 --> 02:31.583
Well, how about I keep you
company till they show?

02:31.583 --> 02:33.625
The thing is,
he's far more attractive,

02:33.625 --> 02:36.208
and I'm a girl who paid
a fortune for a good view.

02:36.208 --> 02:38.458
Is that right?

02:38.458 --> 02:40.625
I mean, I'm surprised
you'd show your face at all.

02:40.625 --> 02:43.250
- You got a mask I could borrow?
- I got dozens, love.

02:43.250 --> 02:45.291
How about I call the rail line,
give you a refund?

02:45.291 --> 02:46.583
Will they cover
emotional damage?

02:46.583 --> 02:48.250
I think
this is the quiet car.

02:48.250 --> 02:49.416
Mm.

02:54.750 --> 02:56.583
I told them
I was bringing him in myself.

02:56.583 --> 02:58.000
What are you doing here, Mason?

02:58.000 --> 03:00.125
Grace needed the best on this.

03:00.125 --> 03:03.750
Right. So, as I said,
what are you doing here?

03:03.750 --> 03:05.250
We're a team.

03:05.250 --> 03:07.458
We were a team.

03:07.458 --> 03:09.833
<i>No comprende español.</i>

03:11.125 --> 03:12.458
What's with the wedding ring?

03:12.458 --> 03:14.958
Oh. It's part of my cover.

03:16.166 --> 03:17.708
Or maybe it's just an old habit.

03:17.708 --> 03:19.041
I thought your
old habit was lying.

03:19.041 --> 03:21.708
I thought your old habit
was just leaving.

03:22.750 --> 03:24.375
I've been in Berlin.

03:24.375 --> 03:26.125
- Good schnitzel?
- I've been on mission.

03:26.125 --> 03:27.958
How is Operation Bullshit?

03:40.291 --> 03:42.458
Don't flatter yourself.
He's got backup.

03:42.458 --> 03:44.125
- You would've blown our cover.
- Uh-huh.

03:44.125 --> 03:45.750
- I pursue. You flank.
- I pursue, you flank.

03:45.750 --> 03:47.250
I don't flank.
I'm not a flanker.

03:47.250 --> 03:49.625
This is my mission.
You flank, love.

03:49.625 --> 03:51.041
His handler's in a tan...

03:51.041 --> 03:52.958
Tan suit. I know, love.

04:17.208 --> 04:19.750
Hey! Pal.

04:26.083 --> 04:28.291
You know what's gonna
happen now, right?

05:28.041 --> 05:30.166
Gregor Yovanovitch?

05:35.708 --> 05:39.125
I think you dropped it
in the passenger car.

05:39.125 --> 05:40.541
Thank you.

05:40.541 --> 05:42.458
Look, I don't know
if this is too forward

05:42.458 --> 05:44.166
or anything, but...

05:44.166 --> 05:46.000
mind if I join you?

05:47.041 --> 05:48.125
Not at all. Please.

05:48.125 --> 05:50.333
I'm Charlotte.

05:50.333 --> 05:52.291
- Gregor, of course.
- Hi.

05:53.333 --> 05:54.541
I love your lipstick.

05:54.541 --> 05:56.291
I thought you might.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.458
You have beautiful eyes.

06:19.500 --> 06:21.416
What, has no one
ever told you that?

06:21.416 --> 06:22.791
No.

06:24.458 --> 06:25.750
Oh-oh, oh.

06:27.458 --> 06:28.833
Is that your foot?

06:28.833 --> 06:31.000
Oh, no, Gregor.

06:32.291 --> 06:35.250
It's a .22 Beretta
aimed at your nuts.

06:35.250 --> 06:38.791
Now, if you're careless enough
to lose your wallet,

06:38.791 --> 06:41.125
you sure can't be trusted
with all that uranium

06:41.125 --> 06:43.416
on a crowded train.

06:45.958 --> 06:48.416
What are you, CIA?

06:48.416 --> 06:50.625
- MI6?
- Oh, come on, Greg.

06:50.625 --> 06:53.916
Do I look like a woman that
plays for the minor leagues?

06:59.333 --> 07:00.750
You're Citadel.

07:02.208 --> 07:04.666
I thought Citadel was a myth.

07:24.250 --> 07:26.041
The bag.

07:26.041 --> 07:27.833
Now.

07:35.791 --> 07:37.250
Nadia.

07:38.333 --> 07:41.083
That's your real name, right?

07:41.083 --> 07:42.875
There is no uranium.

07:45.125 --> 07:47.791
We fed false information
to your people

07:47.791 --> 07:53.083
to lure you here so I can
hand-deliver a message.

08:41.791 --> 08:44.208
Bernard, you got eyes on Nadia?

08:44.208 --> 08:46.458
<i>Checking now.</i>

08:46.458 --> 08:48.125
Dining car.

08:49.083 --> 08:50.666
On my way.

08:58.875 --> 09:00.875
You know him, I imagine.

09:00.875 --> 09:02.416
Vishal Rai.

09:02.416 --> 09:06.208
He's got the most beautiful
apartment in Mumbai.

09:08.208 --> 09:10.500
Himari Tanaka in Tokyo.

09:10.500 --> 09:13.916
The Citadel tech team
in Mexico City.

09:15.166 --> 09:17.375
Milan, Paris, Cairo.

09:17.375 --> 09:20.083
And hundreds and hundreds more.

09:23.541 --> 09:26.208
The thing about myths is that

09:26.208 --> 09:29.041
at the end of the day,
they're just stories.

09:30.083 --> 09:32.791
Fallacies, lies.

09:32.791 --> 09:35.250
Who the fuck are you?

09:42.666 --> 09:45.625
The truth is everywhere.

09:54.208 --> 09:57.041
- Give it to me.
- I think maybe you're outgunned.

10:00.541 --> 10:03.375
Long ago, you convinced
yourselves of a lie.

10:03.375 --> 10:08.041
That you at Citadel
are not agents but angels.

10:08.041 --> 10:10.166
We waited a long time
to wipe Citadel

10:10.166 --> 10:11.875
from the face of the Earth.

10:12.958 --> 10:14.791
And seeing you now, that...

10:14.791 --> 10:16.333
that...

10:16.333 --> 10:18.583
that look in your eyes...

10:18.583 --> 10:21.208
it was worth the wait.

10:29.375 --> 10:31.166
- How many?
- Six.

11:20.791 --> 11:21.791
Down!

11:22.750 --> 11:24.416
Get down!

11:31.583 --> 11:33.500
- We were set up.
- Who are they?

11:33.500 --> 11:37.041
I don't know, but they're
burning Citadel to the ground.

11:40.333 --> 11:42.833
- I need to tell you something.
- I lied to you.

11:42.833 --> 11:44.458
I lied to you.

11:44.458 --> 11:46.041
<i>Mason.</i>

11:46.041 --> 11:48.125
Bernard, we need evac.

11:48.125 --> 11:50.708
Bernard?

11:51.750 --> 11:53.666
Bernard?

11:56.375 --> 12:00.791
Manticore will always find you.

14:44.166 --> 14:47.375
Help! Help!

14:54.333 --> 14:56.166
<i>You attacked
our best surgeon.</i>

14:57.708 --> 14:59.208
<i>Broke his arm.</i>

15:00.208 --> 15:01.875
What happened?

15:01.875 --> 15:05.041
There was an explosion on board
a... a passenger train.

15:05.041 --> 15:07.166
You washed ashore in Lezzeno.

15:07.166 --> 15:09.375
Do you remember being
on that train?

15:11.166 --> 15:12.791
No.

15:13.916 --> 15:15.833
Do you remember your name?

15:15.833 --> 15:17.583
Yeah, it's...

15:20.166 --> 15:21.833
<i>It appears
you're suffering</i>

15:21.833 --> 15:25.250
<i>from retrograde amnesia,
which affects your memories.</i>

15:25.250 --> 15:27.583
<i>Do you know a man
named Kyle Conroy?</i>

15:27.583 --> 15:30.375
<i>No. Who's that?</i>

15:30.375 --> 15:32.291
<i>You.</i>

15:37.250 --> 15:39.250
This was in your pocket.

15:40.416 --> 15:42.125
As was this.

15:43.833 --> 15:46.666
The American consulate can't
find any relatives

15:46.666 --> 15:48.666
or records of you.

15:48.666 --> 15:50.750
It's like you're a ghost.

16:06.583 --> 16:10.791
<i>♪ Sometimes you win,
sometimes you lose ♪</i>

16:10.791 --> 16:14.083
<i>♪ And sometimes the blues

16:14.083 --> 16:16.916

Blueberry pancakes?

16:36.583 --> 16:38.625
- How many of those
are you gonna eat?
- All of them.

16:38.625 --> 16:40.333
Save one for me, will you?

16:40.333 --> 16:41.958
<i>...in one of
the worst attacks</i>

16:41.958 --> 16:44.000
<i>since the fighting
in the city began.</i>

16:44.000 --> 16:46.041
<i>Domestic terror groups have
claimed responsibility</i>

16:46.041 --> 16:49.208
<i>for the bombings as
the government readies for war.</i>

16:49.208 --> 16:50.750
<i>This is the tenth such attack...</i>

16:51.875 --> 16:54.041
All right.
Bus is here in five minutes.

16:54.041 --> 16:55.750
- You ready for school?
- Yep.

16:55.750 --> 16:57.750
Soccer cleats? Really, dude?

16:57.750 --> 16:59.375
School shoes, now. Come on.

17:08.500 --> 17:10.458
<i>You ever been
to therapy before?</i>

17:10.458 --> 17:12.583
In the beginning.

17:12.583 --> 17:14.208
Then I stopped.

17:14.208 --> 17:15.708
Why?

17:18.500 --> 17:21.083
I was terrified
of what I'd find.

17:21.083 --> 17:24.750
You know, no one came looking
for me after the accident.

17:24.750 --> 17:26.833
Can you imagine
how horrible I must have been

17:26.833 --> 17:29.500
to not have one single person
come looking for me?

17:30.541 --> 17:31.875
So, if you're so afraid
of what you'll find,

17:31.875 --> 17:33.166
why are you here now?

17:36.875 --> 17:39.291
'Cause I feel like
I'm keeping secrets from myself.

17:39.291 --> 17:41.291
And I just need to know.

17:41.291 --> 17:44.000
I need to know.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.833
So when my daughter asks me,
you know,

17:46.833 --> 17:49.125
"What was your mom like?"

17:49.125 --> 17:52.333
Did I have a dad
or a dog

17:52.333 --> 17:54.541
or make wishes?

17:54.541 --> 17:56.541
See, I got nothing to give her.

17:56.541 --> 17:59.416
And, uh... and she should know.

17:59.416 --> 18:01.500
She deserves to know.

18:01.500 --> 18:04.125
And I deserve to know.

18:05.166 --> 18:07.583
And, uh...

18:07.583 --> 18:10.500
you know, when they pulled me
from the water, I...

18:10.500 --> 18:13.041
I had a wedding ring and, uh...

18:15.500 --> 18:19.166
These past few months,
I've been having these...

18:19.166 --> 18:23.625
visions of a... of a woman.

18:24.958 --> 18:26.375
A woman?

18:27.458 --> 18:29.708
Yeah, I-I think she was
on that train with me.

18:29.708 --> 18:33.708
I know she was. And, uh...

18:33.708 --> 18:36.458
if I can find out who she is,

18:36.458 --> 18:39.250
then maybe I can find out
who I am.

18:41.625 --> 18:43.708
Kyle...

18:43.708 --> 18:45.708
as much as I'd love
to charge you weekly

18:45.708 --> 18:48.541
and make a small fortune
off your condition,

18:48.541 --> 18:51.000
I think the best course
would be to swab your DNA,

18:51.000 --> 18:53.125
run it through one of
the national databases,

18:53.125 --> 18:55.291
see if we can find
any relatives, any information.

18:55.291 --> 18:57.375
Yeah, I did that before,
and nothing showed.

18:57.375 --> 19:00.083
Well, the technology's gotten
more advanced since then.

19:11.375 --> 19:13.333
Mr. Secretary,

19:13.333 --> 19:15.583
thank you for coming to see me
at such short notice.

19:15.583 --> 19:16.875
Madam Ambassador.

19:16.875 --> 19:18.666
I would've met you in D.C.,

19:18.666 --> 19:22.291
but roses can be
needy little wankers.

19:23.750 --> 19:25.666
Let me cut to the liver, Harold.

19:25.666 --> 19:29.500
Eight years ago,
when Citadel fell,

19:29.500 --> 19:34.000
it buried its trove of secrets
in a tungsten-fortified case.

19:34.000 --> 19:38.625
Secrets that may have included
black site locations,

19:38.625 --> 19:42.583
agent identities,
even nuclear codes.

19:43.833 --> 19:47.375
And I've just learned
that your CIA

19:47.375 --> 19:49.583
recently discovered
the whereabouts

19:49.583 --> 19:52.583
of this Citadel X Case.

19:54.750 --> 19:58.333
The UK ambassador is asking
the secretary of state

19:58.333 --> 20:01.125
to divulge
national security secrets?

20:01.125 --> 20:04.083
I'm not asking
in my capacity as ambassador.

20:04.083 --> 20:06.166
No, no, this is...

20:06.166 --> 20:08.708
this is for a different cause.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.750
A greater cause.

20:10.750 --> 20:13.125
The truth.

20:13.125 --> 20:15.333
I don't work
for Manticore anymore.

20:15.333 --> 20:18.458
We've helped you before, so...

20:18.458 --> 20:21.208
now we're calling in our favor.

20:22.625 --> 20:25.166
So, what will it be, Harold?

20:25.166 --> 20:27.000
Shall we plant explosives

20:27.000 --> 20:29.458
on your daughter's
British Airways flight tomorrow

20:29.458 --> 20:31.791
as she flies home from Oxford?

20:31.791 --> 20:35.375
Or shall we abduct your wife

20:35.375 --> 20:38.541
and bury her alive
in my rose garden?

20:42.750 --> 20:45.000
You tell me.

21:12.291 --> 21:14.166
Ma'am?

21:15.208 --> 21:16.500
How is the wedding?

21:16.500 --> 21:17.916
<i>It's over.</i>

21:17.916 --> 21:19.833
I'm sure the bride
looked darling.

21:19.833 --> 21:21.916
<i>I have another job
for you, Davik.</i>

21:23.416 --> 21:25.666
They found the Citadel X Case.

21:25.666 --> 21:28.166
<i>It's been moved
to a CIA black site</i>

21:28.166 --> 21:30.166
<i>at a shipping yard in Miami.</i>

21:30.166 --> 21:32.000
<i>I want you to retrieve it.</i>

21:32.000 --> 21:33.416
Understood.

21:33.416 --> 21:35.041
Is your brother up for this?

21:35.041 --> 21:36.666
<i>Of course he's up for this.</i>

21:36.666 --> 21:38.791
<i>Ah, he cost us
dearly in Beijing.</i>

21:38.791 --> 21:40.625
<i>He's letting things slide.</i>

21:40.625 --> 21:42.458
<i>The families weren't pleased.</i>

21:43.500 --> 21:45.458
Did you hear that, Anders?

21:47.416 --> 21:49.250
Yeah.

21:49.250 --> 21:51.625
I hear you, Dahlia,
loud and clear.

21:51.625 --> 21:52.916
We're on it.

22:07.750 --> 22:09.458
Oh, yes.

22:09.458 --> 22:11.375
I love this game.

22:11.375 --> 22:14.875
Okay, guys,
we're gonna play a game.

22:14.875 --> 22:16.958
The rules are simple.

22:16.958 --> 22:22.666
Whoever guesses
three distinctive features

22:22.666 --> 22:27.500
of an opponent's
Secret Someone wins.

22:27.500 --> 22:29.291
I mean, it's pretty easy, right?

22:29.291 --> 22:31.416
Okay, great. Here we go.
I'll begin.

22:31.416 --> 22:35.041
Does your Secret Someone

22:35.041 --> 22:37.666
have blond hair?

22:38.916 --> 22:40.250
Yes.

22:40.250 --> 22:41.791
That's one for me.

22:41.791 --> 22:43.208
Go ahead. Your turn.

22:43.208 --> 22:47.208
Does your Secret Someone
have freckles?

22:47.208 --> 22:48.583
No.

22:50.041 --> 22:53.791
Okay. Does your Secret Someone
have a mustache?

22:53.791 --> 22:55.458
What the fuck is wrong with you?

22:57.333 --> 22:59.625
Okay.
Just you and me.

23:01.083 --> 23:03.958
Does your Secret Someone know

23:03.958 --> 23:08.125
why your Manticore pal
Dahlia Archer had a meeting

23:08.125 --> 23:11.791
with Secretary McCulough
yesterday at her home?

23:15.666 --> 23:17.083
Hmm?

23:17.083 --> 23:21.500
She wanted the location
of Citadel's X Case.

23:22.750 --> 23:24.166
Why?

23:25.208 --> 23:26.750
Nuclear codes.

23:27.791 --> 23:29.208
That's interesting.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.750
Oh, my God.

23:39.875 --> 23:41.625
Yeah.

23:41.625 --> 23:42.708
No... No!

23:59.875 --> 24:01.916
Just a sec.

24:03.833 --> 24:05.833
"Just a sec"?

24:05.833 --> 24:07.750
What kind of shady shit
you doing in here?

24:07.750 --> 24:09.250
Little rub and tug?

24:09.250 --> 24:10.875
No.

24:10.875 --> 24:12.583
Good.

24:12.583 --> 24:14.541
'Cause it was fantasy suites
on <i>The Bachelor,</i>

24:14.541 --> 24:16.291
and I just finished
a glass of wine.

24:16.291 --> 24:17.833
A whole glass of wine?

24:17.833 --> 24:19.833
A whole half.

24:21.500 --> 24:23.875
- Hendrix asleep?
- Mm-hmm.

24:23.875 --> 24:26.375
Abby C.

24:26.375 --> 24:27.750
Will you accept this rose?

24:27.750 --> 24:29.958
I love you.

24:35.750 --> 24:37.583
What's wrong?

24:38.875 --> 24:40.125
Kyle.

24:41.458 --> 24:43.458
Dad?

24:45.791 --> 24:47.375
Earth to Kyle.

24:47.375 --> 24:49.458
Dad!

24:51.958 --> 24:53.791
I got it.

25:00.333 --> 25:02.541
I'm right here.

25:02.541 --> 25:04.291
Had another nightmare.

25:04.291 --> 25:06.250
- Another one?
- Mm-hmm.

25:06.250 --> 25:08.458
What was it this time?

25:08.458 --> 25:11.166
Some of the kids in school
said that we're gonna get bombed

25:11.166 --> 25:13.000
and there was a war.

25:13.000 --> 25:16.583
And people are gonna
eat people, including me.

25:16.583 --> 25:19.000
Well, some of the kids
at school are stupid.

25:20.291 --> 25:22.666
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you.

25:22.666 --> 25:26.125
Did your dad tuck you in
when you had bad dreams?

25:26.125 --> 25:28.375
I don't remember.

25:28.375 --> 25:30.250
Do you want to remember?

25:31.875 --> 25:33.708
Time for sleep, sweetheart.

25:41.916 --> 25:43.833
Good night, beautiful.

26:41.833 --> 26:43.625
- Hey.
- <i>There's someone
in the house.</i>

26:47.500 --> 26:49.250
Abby!

26:53.083 --> 26:54.125
Kyle.

26:54.125 --> 26:55.750
- Dad!
- Get in the car.
Get in the car!

26:55.750 --> 26:57.208
For goodness' sake,
we're not who you think we are.

26:57.208 --> 27:00.416
Kyle Conroy, Abigail Conroy,
Hendrix Conroy.

27:00.416 --> 27:02.583
Right? How did I do?
Get in the car.

27:02.583 --> 27:05.083
- Take me. You don't need them.
- Do you know who I am?

27:05.083 --> 27:06.708
- No.
- Do you know where we're going?

27:06.708 --> 27:09.250
- No.
- Then how the fuck
do you know what I need?

27:09.250 --> 27:11.250
Get in the car.
Back up. Back up.

27:12.750 --> 27:14.125
Get in.

27:16.500 --> 27:17.791
Come on.

27:17.791 --> 27:19.500
Let's go.

27:25.458 --> 27:26.833
That's it.

27:28.250 --> 27:29.875
It's all right. We're okay.

27:29.875 --> 27:30.916
Everything's gonna be all right.

27:30.916 --> 27:32.000
<i>Cabin secure.</i>

27:32.000 --> 27:34.541
Put them to sleep.

27:34.541 --> 27:36.166
<i>Dispensing.
Dispensing.</i>

27:36.166 --> 27:37.500
Let's go.

27:37.500 --> 27:39.750
Don't you do that,
you son of a bitch! No!

27:39.750 --> 27:41.375
- Mom!
- No. No, no.

27:41.375 --> 27:43.666
Don't you do that!

28:34.708 --> 28:36.791
Okay, everybody.
Here we go.

28:36.791 --> 28:40.625
We're live in three, two...

28:40.625 --> 28:42.458
Ambassador,
do you believe that

28:42.458 --> 28:44.375
certain nation-states
are too powerful,

28:44.375 --> 28:46.291
with monopolies
on natural resources,

28:46.291 --> 28:47.875
possession of nuclear weapons,

28:47.875 --> 28:50.875
inclinations to wage war
to further GDP interests?

28:50.875 --> 28:54.166
Sounds like
a gotcha question, but yes.

28:54.166 --> 28:56.375
Would you support
limiting the powers

28:56.375 --> 28:58.750
of a nation that may pose
a global threat?

28:58.750 --> 29:00.000
I would.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.541
As would the prime minister,

29:01.541 --> 29:03.541
who I so proudly represent
here today.

29:03.541 --> 29:05.458
So you would support
limiting the powers

29:05.458 --> 29:08.000
of Great Britain?

29:08.000 --> 29:10.750
Surely, you would recognize that
Great Britain and her allies

29:10.750 --> 29:13.500
have invaded other countries,
destabilized economies,

29:13.500 --> 29:15.250
created an oligarchy that is run

29:15.250 --> 29:17.708
by crooked politicians
and corporate titans.

29:17.708 --> 29:20.375
I don't recognize that,
Marjorie, no.

29:20.375 --> 29:22.916
This is a nation
that has ended wars,

29:22.916 --> 29:25.166
sometimes before
they've even begun,

29:25.166 --> 29:27.291
protected natural resources,

29:27.291 --> 29:30.166
and furthered peace
and humanity worldwide.

29:30.166 --> 29:32.291
Some would say you are
the queen of alternative facts.

29:32.291 --> 29:34.833
Let me be clear.

29:34.833 --> 29:37.916
I take great pride in
Britain's standing in the world,

29:37.916 --> 29:39.666
in the choices she's made.

29:39.666 --> 29:41.291
And let me say this, too.

29:41.291 --> 29:43.875
We will strike back in force

29:43.875 --> 29:47.208
against any entity
that threatens our democracy,

29:47.208 --> 29:50.666
whether that be hackers,
a foreign government

29:50.666 --> 29:54.750
or, say, an agent of the press

29:54.750 --> 29:57.208
leading a dangerous
misinformation campaign

29:57.208 --> 29:59.458
to further
foreign state interests.

30:01.125 --> 30:03.375
And we're cut.

30:03.375 --> 30:05.791
Did you just call me
a Russian asset on live TV?

30:05.791 --> 30:08.416
Come on now, dear.
I didn't say Russian.

30:13.375 --> 30:14.833
The brothers have the X Case,

30:14.833 --> 30:16.416
but the lock is
heavily encrypted.

30:16.416 --> 30:18.041
They're headed to New York
to decode it.

30:18.041 --> 30:20.041
The families
will be pleased.

30:20.041 --> 30:21.750
Tell Davik I want
that information

30:21.750 --> 30:23.916
- the moment it's ready.
- Of course, ma'am.

30:59.250 --> 31:00.791
I apologize for the theatrics,

31:00.791 --> 31:03.291
but it's for
your safety and ours.

31:04.333 --> 31:06.041
Who are you people?

31:06.041 --> 31:07.958
Where's our daughter?

31:07.958 --> 31:09.458
I'm Bernard Orlick.

31:09.458 --> 31:11.541
- This is my wife Joe.
- Ex-wife.

31:11.541 --> 31:12.750
Ex-wife.

31:12.750 --> 31:15.083
- This is my wife Sandra.
- Hi.

31:15.083 --> 31:18.208
And your daughter is downstairs
and safe with our daughter Val.

31:18.208 --> 31:20.125
I swear to God,
if you lay a finger on her...

31:20.125 --> 31:21.666
Lay a finger on her?

31:21.666 --> 31:23.458
I brought you here
to keep you safe.

31:23.458 --> 31:25.375
Keep us safe?
You gassed us in your truck.

31:25.375 --> 31:26.750
I'm sorry,
there wasn't really time

31:26.750 --> 31:28.250
for a cappuccino and a chat.

31:28.250 --> 31:30.500
You're lucky that I found you
before Manticore could.

31:30.500 --> 31:33.041
- What do you want from us?
- Listen, 23andMe.

31:33.041 --> 31:36.833
You've been searching
to find out who you are, right?

31:36.833 --> 31:38.458
What happened to you
eight years ago?

31:38.458 --> 31:40.583
Well, look no further.

31:40.583 --> 31:42.833
We're here to help you.

31:42.833 --> 31:45.000
Why should I trust
anything you say?

31:45.000 --> 31:48.541
Because, believe it or not,
we're old friends.

31:54.166 --> 31:55.958
It's good to see you, Mason.

31:55.958 --> 31:58.375
- Mason?
- Mm-hmm.

31:58.375 --> 32:00.750
Ready to find out who you are?

32:03.166 --> 32:05.500
<i>Okay,
logging Agent Mason Kane.</i>

32:05.500 --> 32:07.333
<i>Mission scan initializing.</i>

32:07.333 --> 32:09.333
<i>- Stand still.
- I am standing still.</i>

32:09.333 --> 32:11.041
<i>Okay, now smile.</i>

32:11.041 --> 32:13.458
- <i>I'm not gonna fucking smile.</i>
- You see what a joy you were?

32:13.458 --> 32:14.791
<i>Command says
you have to smile.</i>

32:14.791 --> 32:16.083
<i>Mason Kane
doesn't smile.</i>

32:16.083 --> 32:17.958
You talked about yourself
in the third person.

32:17.958 --> 32:19.750
<i>Fine.
How about a smize?</i>

32:19.750 --> 32:21.375
<i>That's where you smile
with your eyes.</i>

32:21.375 --> 32:23.208
<i>I'm gonna kill you, Bernard.
I'll actually kill you.</i>

32:23.208 --> 32:25.000
It was a very hostile workplace.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.666
<i>How about you
try killing me with kindness?</i>

32:26.666 --> 32:29.125
- <i>Fuck me.</i>
- Fuck me.

32:29.125 --> 32:31.291
You're telling me I was a spy.

32:32.875 --> 32:35.083
Why do you think
there was no trace of you?

32:35.083 --> 32:37.500
Because there is no Kyle Conroy.

32:37.500 --> 32:40.208
- Bingo, my friend.
- It's an alias.

32:40.208 --> 32:42.708
One of many
I came up with for you.

32:42.708 --> 32:44.625
I have a gift for names.

32:44.625 --> 32:46.166
I mean, I have many gifts.

32:46.166 --> 32:50.041
And my scars, they're, what,
bullet wounds, knife wounds?

32:50.041 --> 32:51.875
Machete wounds, shrapnel wounds,

32:51.875 --> 32:55.000
oyster shucker wounds...
the list is endless.

32:55.000 --> 32:58.000
So what were we?
CIA? Special forces?

32:58.000 --> 33:00.916
Nope.
What you were was a myth.

33:00.916 --> 33:03.833
What you were was Citadel.

33:03.833 --> 33:05.500
Citadel?

33:05.500 --> 33:07.375
I thought you had
a gift for names.

33:08.791 --> 33:11.041
For as long
as they've been around,

33:11.041 --> 33:14.125
spy agencies have started wars,

33:14.125 --> 33:18.583
<i>assassinated world leaders,
killed innocents.</i>

33:18.583 --> 33:20.916
<i>So, a century ago,</i>

33:20.916 --> 33:23.125
<i>a group of spies and friends
recruited individuals</i>

33:23.125 --> 33:24.833
<i>from around the world</i>

33:24.833 --> 33:26.208
<i>to create a spy organization</i>

33:26.208 --> 33:28.291
<i>loyal to no man</i>

33:28.291 --> 33:29.833
and to no nation.

33:29.833 --> 33:32.708
Loyal only to the safety
and security of all people.

33:32.708 --> 33:34.208
You wouldn't know we existed,

33:34.208 --> 33:37.708
but we helped shape
every major event for good

33:37.708 --> 33:39.458
in the past 100 years.

33:40.458 --> 33:42.333
- We were the good guys.
- Mm-hmm.

33:42.333 --> 33:44.625
The last line of defense
for good in the world.

33:44.625 --> 33:47.208
But then, eight years ago,
we were double-crossed

33:47.208 --> 33:50.291
by one of our own,
an unknown agent

33:50.291 --> 33:53.375
who took a list
of all of Citadel's spies

33:53.375 --> 33:54.958
and transferred it
into the wrong hands.

33:54.958 --> 33:57.375
They tried to kill me
on that train.

33:57.375 --> 33:59.416
Mm-hmm.

33:59.416 --> 34:01.708
I've been searching for
eight years for survivors.

34:01.708 --> 34:05.708
I thought that only one
Citadel spy had survived.

34:05.708 --> 34:08.250
Luckily, this Citadel spy

34:08.250 --> 34:10.166
was head and shoulders
above the rest.

34:10.166 --> 34:12.541
The agency's tech genius.

34:12.666 --> 34:15.333
Destined to carry the world
on his back like Atlas.

34:15.333 --> 34:17.041
Please don't tell me.

34:17.041 --> 34:19.083
- His name?
- Is it you?

34:21.791 --> 34:22.875
- Jesus Christ.
- No.

34:22.875 --> 34:24.375
Bernard Orlick.

34:24.375 --> 34:25.416
Watch your feet.

34:25.416 --> 34:27.500
Come here.

34:29.458 --> 34:31.666
This is who
we're fighting against.

34:31.666 --> 34:33.916
"Manticore"? They did this?

34:33.916 --> 34:35.458
Manticore emerged
eight years ago

34:35.458 --> 34:36.916
with the assault on Citadel,

34:36.916 --> 34:39.916
when they murdered
thousands of Citadel spies.

34:39.916 --> 34:43.083
Manticore was founded by eight
of the wealthiest families

34:43.083 --> 34:44.333
from around the world,

34:44.333 --> 34:46.250
who built their own spy network

34:46.250 --> 34:49.666
to manipulate world events
and amass wealth and power.

34:49.666 --> 34:52.416
And with Citadel slaughtered
and my tech in their hands,

34:52.416 --> 34:53.916
they wreaked havoc.

34:53.916 --> 34:56.166
Oil crises, grid failures,

34:56.166 --> 34:58.083
catastrophic wars.

34:58.083 --> 35:00.750
You didn't bring us here
to keep us safe.

35:02.041 --> 35:05.083
I brought you here because
I very much need your help.

35:05.083 --> 35:06.541
Mason's help.

35:06.541 --> 35:09.208
Early this morning,
Citadel's X Case,

35:09.208 --> 35:11.000
<i>containing all our secrets,</i>

35:11.000 --> 35:13.166
<i>was stolen
by two Manticore agents.</i>

35:13.166 --> 35:15.791
The kind of secrets that can
murder millions of people

35:15.791 --> 35:17.958
or hold entire nations hostage.

35:17.958 --> 35:20.583
And now those two agents
are on their way to New York

35:20.583 --> 35:22.000
to tear open that case.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.416
And if they succeed,

35:23.416 --> 35:25.833
Manticore will have,
among other things,

35:25.833 --> 35:29.250
all the codes to every
nuclear weapon in the world.

35:29.250 --> 35:31.416
Excuse me.

35:31.416 --> 35:33.958
So I need you to come
to New York with me

35:33.958 --> 35:36.625
and get that case
before Manticore can open it.

35:36.625 --> 35:38.458
I need Mason Kane.

35:38.458 --> 35:40.250
Well, I'm not him.

35:40.250 --> 35:42.041
I coach Little League.

35:42.041 --> 35:43.458
I think you'll find
that there is

35:43.458 --> 35:45.250
a lot more of him in you
than you realize.

35:51.166 --> 35:53.041
The fuck is wrong with you?

35:53.041 --> 35:54.500
There's my guy.

35:54.500 --> 35:58.125
Your mind may not remember,
but your body does.

35:59.625 --> 36:02.541
I mean, you were
our top spy, after all.

36:02.541 --> 36:05.000
I was Citadel's top spy?

36:05.000 --> 36:06.708
Well, no,
not really the top spy.

36:06.708 --> 36:09.583
I mean, you did have a...
a partner.

36:09.583 --> 36:13.500
I mean, alone, you two were...
you know, you-you were amazing,

36:13.500 --> 36:15.541
but together,
you were hot stuff.

36:16.583 --> 36:18.166
What was her name?

36:24.750 --> 36:26.666
Her name was Nadia Sinh.

36:26.666 --> 36:28.500
You help me get that case,

36:28.500 --> 36:31.208
I'll help you remember
who you were and who she was.

36:31.208 --> 36:32.625
Who she was?

36:32.625 --> 36:35.041
Nadia sent a Mayday call
the day that Citadel fell.

36:35.041 --> 36:37.083
And then after that,
she went dark.

36:37.083 --> 36:39.541
I think she's dead.

36:39.541 --> 36:41.750
If Manticore gets
those nuclear codes,

36:41.750 --> 36:44.708
I promise you,
they will not hesitate

36:44.708 --> 36:48.875
to kill you, to kill Abby
and to kill Hendrix.

36:49.916 --> 36:52.208
You want to save your family?

36:53.291 --> 36:54.958
