01:07.500 --> 01:08.985
<i>When I was ten,</i>

01:09.085 --> 01:13.272
<i>and my brother, Oz, was seven,</i>

01:13.372 --> 01:15.307
<i>our lives changed.</i>

01:15.407 --> 01:19.478
<i>Our lives changed
in the blink of an eye.</i>

01:20.146 --> 01:22.148
<i>Forever.</i>

01:53.479 --> 01:57.149
- I assume you're our driver?
- We're here to take you to the farm.

01:57.249 --> 01:59.285
In this?

02:00.787 --> 02:02.739
This is unacceptable.

02:02.839 --> 02:05.758
We require a proper ambulance.

02:05.858 --> 02:07.960
After that, I'll need to inspect
the accommodations

02:08.060 --> 02:11.407
to ensure that they're acceptable and...

02:13.132 --> 02:16.978
Hello, children. I'm Louisa.

02:17.770 --> 02:21.708
And I know you go by Lou and Oz.

02:21.808 --> 02:24.010
Welcome to Virginia.

02:24.310 --> 02:26.445
This here's my friend, Eugene.

02:26.545 --> 02:30.192
Excuse me, madam.
You can't expect us to ride back there.

02:31.217 --> 02:33.653
No, I checked the fare back.

02:33.753 --> 02:38.524
There's enough right here
to get you on the first train out.

02:38.624 --> 02:42.528
Perhaps you don't speak English
that well. I'm coming with you.

02:42.628 --> 02:48.000
Perhaps you don't understand how folks
around here feel about trespassers.

02:48.100 --> 02:50.436
We take it very seriously.

02:50.536 --> 02:53.807
And I've never fired
a warning shot in my life.

03:00.546 --> 03:01.842
Come on now.

03:04.450 --> 03:07.853
Amanda, it's Louisa.

03:09.555 --> 03:14.259
I'm so glad we finally get to meet.

04:11.379 --> 04:13.185
That's Hell no.

04:13.285 --> 04:15.848
What you looking at?

04:37.443 --> 04:40.380
- Hop in, Diamond.
- Come on, Jeb. Come on.

04:40.980 --> 04:43.199
Who's that?

04:45.401 --> 04:47.436
Howdy y'all.

04:48.087 --> 04:51.090
I expect y'all being
Ms. Louisa's people.

04:56.662 --> 04:58.664
Folks around here call me Diamond.

04:58.764 --> 05:01.400
My daddy say that's how hard my head be.

05:02.334 --> 05:05.104
I'm Lou. This is Oz.

05:06.805 --> 05:09.708
Sorry to hear about your momma
being hurt.

05:09.808 --> 05:12.811
She's going to get better.

05:23.522 --> 05:26.364
- Are we here?
- Oh, no.

05:26.464 --> 05:29.361
Hell No's just dropping me off
at the river to go fishing.

05:29.461 --> 05:33.366
- His name's Eugene.
- Folks around here call him Hell No.

05:33.866 --> 05:35.367
Why?

05:35.467 --> 05:38.871
Well, when Hell No was a baby,
his daddy left him.

05:39.171 --> 05:43.462
Folks asked, "You gonna come back
and get him?" He said, "Hell, no!"

06:51.978 --> 06:56.248
John Jacob Cardinal.

06:57.900 --> 06:59.835
Dad.

07:27.579 --> 07:29.315
Not now, Amanda.

07:29.415 --> 07:33.902
- We can't live off awards, Jack.
- I said, not now, Amanda!

08:15.394 --> 08:18.697
I wish you'd stop doing that.
It's not going to help.

08:18.797 --> 08:21.600
Your problem is
you don't believe in anything.

08:21.700 --> 08:24.837
And your problem is
you believe in everything.

08:26.939 --> 08:29.441
Everything all right?

08:35.347 --> 08:38.985
- What is that for, Oz?
- A way to help Mom.

08:39.085 --> 08:41.582
Lou doesn't believe it.

08:42.087 --> 08:43.381
Well...

08:43.482 --> 08:45.891
believing in something is...

08:45.991 --> 08:49.929
a lot better than having an empty heart.

09:43.482 --> 09:45.351
What smells?

09:45.451 --> 09:49.130
- Well, that'd be manure.
- Oh, you'll get to love that smell.

09:49.230 --> 09:53.677
Now come on over here.
Eugene's gonna show you how to plow.

09:53.777 --> 09:58.631
Now Mable here is about as strong
as anything in the world.

09:58.731 --> 10:02.435
I read an animal book.
They have to show them who's in charge.

10:08.640 --> 10:12.444
I guess Mable didn't read that book.

10:21.653 --> 10:22.788
Louisa.

10:22.888 --> 10:26.792
Lou, Oz, I want you to meet
Cotton Longfellow.

10:27.192 --> 10:29.261
He's one of the finest lawyers
around here.

10:29.361 --> 10:33.899
Well, seeing as I'm also one
of the only lawyers around here,

10:33.999 --> 10:36.468
that is a dubious distinction.

10:36.568 --> 10:38.237
Oz.

10:39.071 --> 10:41.073
Lou.

10:41.874 --> 10:44.610
Lou fell in manure.
That's why she smells.

10:44.710 --> 10:46.712
Oz!

10:47.446 --> 10:51.584
I don't know a farmer worth his take
who hasn't fallen in manure at least once.

10:53.218 --> 10:57.122
I want to say how sorry I am
for your father's passing.

10:57.689 --> 11:00.726
He was one of the greatest writers
this country has ever had.

11:01.226 --> 11:07.199
Lou, I think you might get along
right well with Mr. Longfellow.

11:07.299 --> 11:10.636
Are you related
to Henry Wadsworth Longfellow?

11:10.736 --> 11:14.773
- I am indeed.
- He was a great writer, too.

11:15.273 --> 11:17.409
I live in the shadow of greatness.

11:17.509 --> 11:20.346
Can be a little difficult
for some family members.

11:20.446 --> 11:23.315
Well, Mr. Longfellow and I
have things to talk over,

11:23.415 --> 11:27.027
so you... you best go get cleaned up.
You go help your sister.

11:27.419 --> 11:29.455
It's nice to meet you, Oz, Lou.

11:38.297 --> 11:41.333
So what'd you find out, Cotton?

11:45.437 --> 11:47.058
Well...

11:47.158 --> 11:49.842
there is no money...

11:49.942 --> 11:52.578
in Jack Cardinal's estate.

11:53.412 --> 11:54.963
And...

11:55.063 --> 11:59.868
there are a lot of unpaid
hospital bills for Ms. Amanda.

12:03.088 --> 12:06.591
Well, we'll get by, we always do.

12:07.125 --> 12:10.729
What exactly is wrong with Ms. Amanda?

12:11.897 --> 12:14.867
Mental trauma...

12:15.501 --> 12:18.704
is what the doctor in New York wrote me.

12:19.237 --> 12:22.174
Say she may not get better.

12:22.974 --> 12:25.243
It's up to her.

12:26.992 --> 12:29.448
Maybe up to God.

12:31.216 --> 12:33.051
Well,

12:33.151 --> 12:38.190
mental trauma can sometimes
be overcome by mental stimulation.

12:41.593 --> 12:44.796
What better way to stimulate somebody
than to read to them,

12:44.896 --> 12:48.034
particularly something
that they are very familiar with.

12:49.534 --> 12:52.138
My eyes ain't what they used to be.

12:53.772 --> 12:55.807
But...

13:01.013 --> 13:03.415
I would be honored to read to her.

13:06.784 --> 13:08.787
Good.

13:19.665 --> 13:21.700
<i>Wake up, Lou.</i>

13:21.800 --> 13:25.571
Lou. Wake up, Lou. Breakfast is ready.

13:25.671 --> 13:27.988
Eugene's gonna take you to school.

13:40.819 --> 13:44.089
It's all right. Go ahead.

13:56.368 --> 13:58.370
Lou.

14:02.808 --> 14:06.778
Can anybody tell me where the second
and fourth grade classes are?

14:08.780 --> 14:11.883
Sure. Come on.

14:12.451 --> 14:14.753
Right over here.

14:16.354 --> 14:18.868
Of course, that's just for Yankees.

14:24.062 --> 14:28.500
Class, I'd like to introduce
Louisa Mae and Oscar Cardinal.

14:28.600 --> 14:31.036
Louisa Mae and Oscar,
will you stand up please?

14:31.970 --> 14:34.072
My name is Lou.

14:38.376 --> 14:40.546
Their father was Jack Cardinal,

14:41.046 --> 14:44.382
a famous writer and my former student.

14:44.482 --> 14:47.352
Even met President Roosevelt.

14:47.452 --> 14:50.856
And I hear that Louisa Mae
is also a writer.

14:53.525 --> 14:55.310
Well,

14:55.410 --> 14:59.480
we welcome you, Louisa Mae and Oscar.

15:03.201 --> 15:06.504
My name is Lou.

15:20.051 --> 15:22.654
Why, it's Miss Louisa Mae.

15:22.954 --> 15:25.791
You've been up to see
the President, too?

15:26.158 --> 15:28.328
Are you always this scintillating?

15:30.662 --> 15:32.831
You call me a name?

15:32.931 --> 15:35.901
Didn't you call us Yankees?

15:36.001 --> 15:39.771
You're living with that old woman
and that crippled colored.

15:39.871 --> 15:43.041
Pa said she ain't keeping
that farm going.

15:43.575 --> 15:46.177
Not with three more mouths to feed.

15:46.278 --> 15:48.547
I don't care what your Pa says.

15:50.082 --> 15:52.985
He got a wad a cash as big as my fist.

15:55.653 --> 15:58.296
Then maybe he should
spend it on his family.

15:59.257 --> 16:02.093
You best take that back.

16:02.594 --> 16:04.222
Make me.

16:05.664 --> 16:08.967
Shoot. I ain't hitting no girl.

16:09.067 --> 16:12.704
You're going to have to.
Unless you can take that back.

16:16.024 --> 16:18.526
What have we got here?

16:20.612 --> 16:24.082
- I guess you ain't much of a writer.
- She is too a writer.

16:25.045 --> 16:28.320
Dang you, you no good
stinking blue blood.

16:28.420 --> 16:29.721
Stop it!

16:29.821 --> 16:32.490
Hey! You stop it, now!

16:32.590 --> 16:35.093
- Get off of me.
- Now you apologize to each other!

16:35.193 --> 16:38.497
- You can go straight to hell!
- Stop your nonsense, Billy.

16:38.597 --> 16:41.433
Louisa Mae, come back here!

16:42.801 --> 16:46.037
Ma'am, her name is Lou.

16:51.209 --> 16:55.714
Glad to see you made such
a nice first impression, Lou.

16:55.814 --> 17:01.052
- They called us Yankees.
- Oh, good Lord, ain't that evil.

17:01.152 --> 17:04.856
The boy said we were going
to lose the farm.

17:04.955 --> 17:07.559
It'll be okay, Oz.

17:10.796 --> 17:13.231
I got this for my last birthday.

17:13.330 --> 17:15.666
I want you to have it.

17:17.202 --> 17:20.070
Birthday presents are special, Lou.

17:20.171 --> 17:22.078
But I want to help.

17:23.775 --> 17:28.079
This land has provided
for me all my life.

17:28.179 --> 17:31.774
I think it'll provide for us now.

17:32.417 --> 17:36.454
I know it's a lot with three
more mouths to feed, but...

17:37.689 --> 17:41.375
I wouldn't trade it for all the money
in the world, honey.

17:43.261 --> 17:45.063
Hi, Cotton.

17:45.163 --> 17:46.932
Hey, Cotton.

17:47.032 --> 17:49.500
What are you doing here?

17:49.600 --> 17:53.438
Well, I'm gonna read one
of your father's books to your mother.

17:53.538 --> 17:56.524
Our dad already read
all his books to her.

17:56.624 --> 17:59.578
Besides, she can't hear you anyway.

17:59.678 --> 18:04.616
Lou, go change your clothes
and help Eugene with the chores.

18:04.716 --> 18:06.718
Go on.

18:08.086 --> 18:11.489
Reading to Mom is a good idea.

18:12.457 --> 18:16.895
Thank you Oz. I will do my best.

18:26.271 --> 18:28.856
Good afternoon, Ms. Amanda.

18:29.641 --> 18:32.911
My name is Cotton Longfellow.

18:33.578 --> 18:37.081
And it will be my pleasure
to read to you.

18:45.156 --> 18:47.193
What you working on there, Ms. Lou?

18:47.793 --> 18:49.728
A story.

18:49.828 --> 18:52.462
What it be about?

18:52.762 --> 18:55.290
I don't know, Eugene.

18:56.201 --> 18:59.104
Anything else we can do, Eugene?

19:00.086 --> 19:04.235
- Firewood's got to go inside.
- I'll do it.

19:06.478 --> 19:08.914
What are you going to do now?

19:09.964 --> 19:13.551
- More chores.
- Can I help?

19:14.084 --> 19:15.441
Come on.

19:15.541 --> 19:18.356
"The dirt lane nudged over to the north,

19:18.456 --> 19:20.725
"as it cleared a rise.

19:20.825 --> 19:25.363
"Here the land splayed out
into a broad valley of simple beauty,

19:25.463 --> 19:30.802
"green meadows were bracketed by vast
forests of every wood the state boasted.

19:30.902 --> 19:36.574
"Next to the meadow were cleared
patchwork fields that yielded to...

19:44.750 --> 19:47.218
"weathered gray,

19:47.318 --> 19:51.022
and wrapped with naked
rambling rose vines..."

19:51.122 --> 19:54.292
<i>Cotton was reading my father's words.</i>

19:55.961 --> 19:58.730
<i>Words about this place.</i>

20:00.031 --> 20:02.967
<i>The fields he used to play in.</i>

20:04.903 --> 20:09.107
<i>My only memories of my dad
had been in New York.</i>

20:10.241 --> 20:12.444
<i>But now,</i>

20:12.744 --> 20:16.381
<i>now I was starting to feel him
all around me here,</i>

20:16.481 --> 20:18.583
<i>in this place, too.</i>

20:26.157 --> 20:29.828
- All right. Good boy.
- Good boy, Jeb.

20:29.928 --> 20:33.732
Hell No, come here. Throw it.
Give it a whirl.

20:33.832 --> 20:37.235
Diamond told me about Eugene's
daddy leaving him.

20:37.335 --> 20:39.805
That is a darn lie.

20:39.905 --> 20:44.743
Eugene's daddy did not leave him,
he was killed in a logging accident.

20:45.944 --> 20:49.047
And then after his Auntie passed on,

20:49.147 --> 20:51.383
I took him in.

20:51.483 --> 20:53.551
So why do people call him
that awful name?

20:53.651 --> 20:56.754
Because they're ignorant, that's why.

20:57.789 --> 21:00.425
Memories are a funny thing.

21:00.525 --> 21:02.684
People like to change the past

21:02.784 --> 21:05.946
so they can remember what it is
they want to remember.

21:06.965 --> 21:10.394
- All right, good boy.
- Good boy, Jeb.

21:13.404 --> 21:15.607
How'd you learn how to toss like that?

21:25.850 --> 21:28.219
Your brother's got a really good arm.

21:28.420 --> 21:30.555
Yeah.

21:30.755 --> 21:35.460
What'd you do for fun in the city?
Ever go skinny dippin' in a gravel pit?

21:35.560 --> 21:37.702
There aren't gravel pits in Brooklyn.

21:41.866 --> 21:44.903
<i>I haven't met a boy like Diamond before.</i>

21:45.003 --> 21:47.806
<i>He lived all by himself on the mountain.</i>

21:47.906 --> 21:50.442
<i>His mom had died when he was born</i>

21:50.542 --> 21:53.278
<i>and his dad died
during a mining accident.</i>

21:53.378 --> 21:55.847
<i>The whole mountain had fallen on him.</i>

21:58.399 --> 22:01.887
<i>Louisa said that Diamond and I
were like family.</i>

22:01.987 --> 22:04.322
<i>We're distant cousins.</i>

22:05.990 --> 22:10.261
<i>I never knew I had so much family here.</i>

22:13.298 --> 22:15.534
This here well, it's magic.

22:15.934 --> 22:18.436
What do you mean?

22:18.536 --> 22:21.379
There was a guy and a gal,
they want to get hitched,

22:21.479 --> 22:23.141
but their families wouldn't let them.

22:23.241 --> 22:26.344
So, they made a plan to run off.

22:26.444 --> 22:28.446
Only something happened,

22:28.546 --> 22:33.134
and the fella, he thought
the gal done got killed.

22:33.385 --> 22:34.619
So...

22:34.719 --> 22:38.323
he come down here and he jump in.

22:38.523 --> 22:41.393
That gal, she found out,

22:41.693 --> 22:46.114
she come down here and she jump in, too.

22:46.214 --> 22:49.567
- That sounds like Romeo and Juliet.
- Who?

22:49.667 --> 22:52.270
What makes it magic, Diamond?

22:52.370 --> 22:53.905
Well,

22:54.005 --> 22:58.443
them two people, dying for each other,
that's what made the well magic.

22:58.543 --> 23:01.546
Anybody have a wish,
they come down here, it'll happen.

23:01.846 --> 23:04.549
- There's just one little catch.
- What?

23:04.649 --> 23:07.585
You got to give up the most
important thing you got,

23:07.685 --> 23:10.088
just like they did.

23:10.188 --> 23:12.357
But how do you know if it works?

23:12.457 --> 23:14.485
Well, this here bucket,

23:14.585 --> 23:17.824
- swing from left to right.
- Lou, maybe we can...

23:17.924 --> 23:19.427
- No, Oz.
- But...

23:19.527 --> 23:22.500
It's just like your stupid necklace,
it won't work.

23:22.600 --> 23:24.736
Mom's never coming back.

23:28.906 --> 23:31.943
This morning's lessons
we will practice our letters.

23:32.043 --> 23:36.114
Please take out your books
and write each letter five times.

23:40.918 --> 23:43.168
Lou, is something wrong?

23:48.660 --> 23:50.679
No.

24:11.049 --> 24:12.950
I'm gonna whoop you.

24:13.050 --> 24:14.752
Go get 'em, Will, go get 'em!

24:25.330 --> 24:28.032
What the hell is going on here?

24:28.132 --> 24:30.769
Billy got in another fight, George.

24:33.571 --> 24:35.336
Sorry, pa.

24:37.275 --> 24:40.612
I was working in the damn fields, boy.
Now get up.

24:41.412 --> 24:45.116
Did that damn girl do that to you?
I ain't through with you, boy.

24:45.216 --> 24:47.885
- George, you leave him be.
- Get off of me.

24:49.921 --> 24:52.857
Next year, no more damn school for you.

24:52.957 --> 24:54.459
- You hear me?
- Yes, sir.

24:54.559 --> 24:57.495
Why don't you let Billy decide that?

24:58.896 --> 25:01.599
He a boy, he do what I say.

25:01.699 --> 25:04.903
- Well, I see me a fine young man.
- He ain't a grown man.

25:05.003 --> 25:07.906
Yeah, but you are, so you keep
your hands off of him!

25:11.242 --> 25:15.237
You got that big colored living
in your house, don't ya?

25:15.713 --> 25:19.485
God gonna strike you dead.
God gonna strike you down for that.

25:20.285 --> 25:23.454
Got that Injun blood in ya.

25:23.554 --> 25:26.223
You don't belong here, old woman.

25:26.424 --> 25:29.260
If you ever lay a hand on him again,

25:29.360 --> 25:33.631
you'd better pray to whatever God
it is you counsel with,

25:33.731 --> 25:36.334
that I don't find you, George Davis.

25:36.434 --> 25:38.303
Hey!

25:38.403 --> 25:39.971
Do you know who you're messing with,
old woman?

25:40.071 --> 25:42.040
Yeah, I know who I'm messing with.

25:42.140 --> 25:46.010
Your daddy beat you bad
and he starved you and your sisters.

25:46.110 --> 25:48.846
Many a time I tried
to come between ya's.

25:48.946 --> 25:51.616
And now you've grown up
to be just like him.

25:51.716 --> 25:54.797
Well, Billy's not gonna be like that.

25:55.486 --> 25:58.023
Billy. Wake up, come on.

25:58.523 --> 26:00.591
Come on.

26:01.959 --> 26:03.695
You're gonna hear from me, woman.

26:04.595 --> 26:05.887
Don't you worry, Ms. Louisa,

26:05.987 --> 26:08.851
that man ain't gonna touch you
or the children while I'm around.

26:09.734 --> 26:12.003
Come on, children.

26:18.443 --> 26:21.913
Why did George Davis
say you don't belong here?

26:22.013 --> 26:26.517
Well, my daddy was part Cherokee
and some folks around here don't like that.

26:26.617 --> 26:29.220
Me, I'm proud of it.

26:29.320 --> 26:33.827
So you got Native blood in you, too.
I think that's pretty special.

26:33.927 --> 26:36.761
You should've seen Billy's face
when he opened that lunch pail.

26:36.861 --> 26:39.364
It was so funny.

26:40.765 --> 26:42.734
Oh, look.

26:42.834 --> 26:44.836
Wild grapes.

26:44.936 --> 26:48.673
They're all around here
if you know where to look.

26:48.973 --> 26:53.678
Chestnuts on the ground,
wild onions underneath.

26:53.778 --> 26:56.363
We can get a whole meal
out of this land...

26:57.415 --> 27:01.086
- 'out even lifting a finger.
- They're amazing.

27:02.287 --> 27:04.489
Tell me, Lou,

27:04.589 --> 27:08.592
did you see any food in Billy's pail?

27:10.428 --> 27:11.629
No.

27:11.729 --> 27:17.068
You see, what I find funny is that some
children feel they ought to be ashamed

27:17.168 --> 27:21.572
when their daddy doesn't see fit
to give them anything.

27:22.540 --> 27:27.177
So ashamed that they had to haul
a pail to school and pretend to eat,

27:27.277 --> 27:29.781
so nobody would catch on

27:29.881 --> 27:32.383
that their daddy gives them nothin'.

27:32.583 --> 27:35.286
Do you find that funny, Lou?

27:35.386 --> 27:37.989
- No.
- No.

27:39.224 --> 27:43.995
You see, you had a fine daddy
who loved you very much.

27:44.095 --> 27:49.801
And I know that makes it harder
now that he's gone, but...

27:50.335 --> 27:53.004
the thing is,

27:53.104 --> 27:58.075
Billy Davis has to live
with his daddy every day.

27:58.409 --> 28:02.013
And I pray with all my heart

28:02.113 --> 28:04.367
that he survives it.

28:09.120 --> 28:12.423
Why didn't my dad ever come back here?

28:13.691 --> 28:17.728
You never know what's
in someone else's heart, Lou.

28:17.829 --> 28:21.198
No matter how hard you try.

29:12.850 --> 29:15.563
I wish that my mom would wake up.

29:41.879 --> 29:45.149
Hey, come on! I gotta show you
something. Get your brother.

29:45.249 --> 29:48.686
- Where are we going?
- Come on. We're gonna go see God!

29:53.691 --> 29:58.229
<i>Diamond said every time he came here
God will send him an angel.</i>

29:59.830 --> 30:02.634
<i>He thought he had
a right good regime of 'em.</i>

30:03.134 --> 30:05.870
This is where God touched the earth.

30:08.673 --> 30:11.551
Maybe someday they'll name it after me.

30:19.350 --> 30:22.136
- Put 'er there. Come on, boy.
- What are they doing?

30:22.336 --> 30:24.705
George Davis, he has a still up here.

30:24.805 --> 30:27.408
So the sheriff won't catch him
making moonshine.

30:28.292 --> 30:30.728
- Jeb! Jeb!
- What's that?

30:31.128 --> 30:33.430
You come back here!

30:35.232 --> 30:36.930
Diamond, look out!

30:37.030 --> 30:39.570
- Diamond!
- Billy, go see what that is.

30:39.670 --> 30:42.006
- Run, Oz!
- Hey, you! Get over here!

30:42.106 --> 30:43.474
- Lou!
- I'm gonna get ya!

30:43.574 --> 30:45.165
Oz!

30:46.977 --> 30:50.248
- Where you runnin', boy?
- Help, Lou!

30:51.032 --> 30:53.167
Hey, who told you you could come here?

30:53.517 --> 30:55.720
Let him go!

30:55.820 --> 30:58.056
- Stop! Daddy, no!
- What are you doing?

31:01.492 --> 31:04.162
Come on. Get up! Run, y'all!

31:07.865 --> 31:11.235
What the hell, Billy?
What's wrong with you? Get up!

31:11.335 --> 31:14.873
Don't you ever touch my gun again,
you understand? Never, boy!

31:28.052 --> 31:30.188
You busted up my still!

31:30.288 --> 31:31.689
Don't you dare!

31:31.789 --> 31:34.492
Them little devils tore up my property.
And I'm here to get paid.

31:34.592 --> 31:37.526
Well, why don't you show the sheriff
what they done to your still

31:37.626 --> 31:40.831
- and he can tell me what's fair.
- You know I can't do that, woman.

31:40.931 --> 31:43.869
Well, then you can find your way
off my property.

31:44.969 --> 31:48.372
Now get off before I lose patience
and you lose blood.

31:48.472 --> 31:51.943
- I'll pay you George Davis.
- You little vermin.

31:52.043 --> 31:54.912
My head still burns from where you
clocked me and I don't appreciate it at all.

31:55.012 --> 31:57.348
You lucky then,
'cause I could've hit you harder.

31:57.448 --> 31:59.717
You close that trap,
you don't smart mouth me, you boy.

31:59.817 --> 32:01.510
You want your money or not?

32:01.610 --> 32:03.675
Money?

32:03.775 --> 32:05.222
You ain't got no money.

32:05.322 --> 32:08.959
Got a silver dollar right here.
It's a 100 years old.

32:09.059 --> 32:12.397
Man in Tramont, he told me
he'd pay me 20 dollar for it.

32:12.797 --> 32:14.279
Diamond, don't.

32:15.733 --> 32:18.736
What a man do?
You got to have consequences.

32:18.836 --> 32:21.805
Now look, if I give you this...

32:21.905 --> 32:25.309
you ain't coming back to Ms. Louisa
for nothing. You got to swear.

32:25.409 --> 32:29.014
Sure. Sure, I swear.
Come on, give it to me, I swear.

32:31.682 --> 32:33.746
Now get you gone, George.

32:34.685 --> 32:36.887
All right, Louisa.

32:40.010 --> 32:41.859
But next time,

32:41.959 --> 32:44.840
my gun don't miss.

32:45.429 --> 32:47.431
Ever.

32:50.267 --> 32:52.469
Thanks for the coin.

33:03.080 --> 33:04.882
Oz, why don't you go in
and get cleaned up.

33:04.982 --> 33:09.336
And Diamond, you go in the barn and milk
the cow. Take that dang dog with you.

33:09.436 --> 33:12.123
Now if you run off like that,

33:12.223 --> 33:14.792
and you take your little brother
with you,

33:14.892 --> 33:17.875
he'd cross through fire for ya.

33:17.975 --> 33:19.897
I'm ashamed of you.

33:21.466 --> 33:22.881
I'm really sorry.

33:22.981 --> 33:27.905
If you ever pull another thing like that,
you're gonna feel my hand across your skin.

33:28.005 --> 33:31.442
And believe me, it's something
you ain't ever gonna forget.

33:56.383 --> 33:59.437
Hey, Billy. What's the matter, child?

33:59.937 --> 34:03.491
Ma's baby coming.
She sent me to get you.

34:03.591 --> 34:05.910
She don't feel right.

34:06.010 --> 34:07.244
I'm gonna drive you.

34:07.344 --> 34:09.112
Well, you can drive me,
but I'll walk home.

34:09.213 --> 34:11.482
I don't want you staying
around George Davis.

34:11.581 --> 34:12.817
I'm coming with you.

34:12.917 --> 34:15.585
- No, this is no place for you.
- I want to help.

34:15.686 --> 34:18.121
Billy, is your pa there?

34:18.222 --> 34:20.824
Mare gonna drop its foal.

34:20.925 --> 34:23.860
He's staying in the barn 'til it come.

34:23.960 --> 34:26.396
I'll get my things.

34:40.077 --> 34:41.946
Hi!

34:43.045 --> 34:45.882
I brought you a present.

34:50.353 --> 34:52.956
Here's one for you.

34:53.056 --> 34:55.159
And one for you.

34:55.259 --> 34:57.094
Hey.

34:58.062 --> 34:59.797
Hey.

35:05.853 --> 35:09.440
We still have some time here,
you can go on outside, I'll call you.

35:09.540 --> 35:11.942
How many have you delivered?

35:12.042 --> 35:16.214
Forty two in forty seven years.
I remember 'em all.

35:16.714 --> 35:18.482
And they all lived?

35:20.417 --> 35:24.321
You go on outside now.
I'll let you know when.

35:24.767 --> 35:30.061
Breathe, Sally. Just deep breaths.
That's good. That's good.

35:47.011 --> 35:50.081
I'm sorry about putting
that snake in your pail.

35:50.481 --> 35:53.484
I did it to you first.

35:53.584 --> 35:56.586
My pa kill a man that done it to him.

36:00.424 --> 36:03.026
You're not your dad, Billy.

36:10.134 --> 36:12.870
If I tell him I'm fetching Ms. Louisa...

36:15.406 --> 36:17.207
he'd be mad.

36:18.242 --> 36:20.811
We're here to help your mother.

36:22.279 --> 36:24.415
He can't have a problem with that.

36:25.449 --> 36:27.718
Is that right?

36:29.086 --> 36:32.289
- How's your foal, pa?
- Dead.

36:32.689 --> 36:35.125
What's she doing here?

36:38.629 --> 36:41.065
I got them to help ma.

36:41.165 --> 36:44.368
Ms. Louisa's inside right now.

36:44.468 --> 36:46.737
That woman's inside my house?

36:46.837 --> 36:50.541
It's time. Come on. The baby's comin'.

36:50.641 --> 36:52.710
Listen, you got no business
being here, old woman.

36:52.810 --> 36:56.247
Sally needs help.
Are you gonna do it? Come on.

36:56.647 --> 36:59.850
If it's a girl,
you let her die, you hear?

36:59.950 --> 37:03.044
Don't need me no more damn girls.

37:15.766 --> 37:18.035
He looks like you.

37:18.135 --> 37:21.305
What will you be naming
your new baby boy?

37:21.972 --> 37:24.174
They call you Lou.

37:24.274 --> 37:28.513
- That be your name, girl?
- Well, sort of.

37:29.580 --> 37:31.848
Then it be Lou.

37:31.948 --> 37:34.451
I have a brother, Lou.

37:39.389 --> 37:41.331
Billy,

37:42.993 --> 37:46.330
when the crops are in,
you come see me, all right?

37:46.430 --> 37:48.299
Okay, Ms. Louisa.

37:55.639 --> 37:59.009
Why did Billy's mother marry
a man like George Davis?

37:59.109 --> 38:02.079
Well, 'cause he owned
his own land and livestock.

38:02.679 --> 38:05.282
She could've left the mountain.

38:05.382 --> 38:08.285
Well, this mountain
is all she's ever known.

38:08.385 --> 38:10.821
It's hard to leave that.

38:11.121 --> 38:14.157
Have you ever thought about leaving?

38:14.525 --> 38:17.594
No, I never have.

38:18.128 --> 38:23.200
Me and this land get along
right well. Like family.

38:23.300 --> 38:26.136
I think we'd both be lost
without the other.

38:26.236 --> 38:28.405
And when I'm gone,

38:28.505 --> 38:30.741
it'll belong to you and Oz.

38:32.009 --> 38:33.877
I've never owned anything.

38:33.977 --> 38:39.049
Well, you don't exactly own land, Lou.

38:39.149 --> 38:43.354
You and the high rock just kinda
take care of each other.

38:47.024 --> 38:50.983
Did you have any other children
besides my grandfather?

38:53.898 --> 38:55.900
I...

38:56.000 --> 38:58.602
had me a little girl...

38:59.203 --> 39:01.605
named Annie.

39:01.705 --> 39:05.408
She was so pretty when she was born.

39:06.710 --> 39:10.114
I knitted her a pink cap.

39:10.214 --> 39:12.583
It fit her head real good.

39:13.617 --> 39:15.852
What happened?

39:19.923 --> 39:25.929
Her little chest rose and fell
and rose and fell.

39:28.065 --> 39:31.447
Then it forgot to rise again.

39:34.238 --> 39:38.542
Doesn't seem fair, a momma
don't get to see her baby's eyes

39:38.642 --> 39:40.116
at least once.

40:06.903 --> 40:10.207
My dad died in that accident,

40:10.841 --> 40:13.277
'cause he and my mom were arguing.

40:15.145 --> 40:20.083
Well, Lou, people pass
when it's their time.

40:20.751 --> 40:23.253
We can't forget 'em,

40:23.987 --> 40:26.824
but we got to go on living.

40:28.659 --> 40:31.862
And the folks we still have with us,

40:31.962 --> 40:35.806
they deserve all the help
we can give 'em.

40:38.368 --> 40:41.938
I think it's time I showed you
something. Come on.

40:54.284 --> 40:57.988
These are the letters
your mother wrote to me.

40:58.422 --> 41:00.957
I didn't know she did that.

41:01.057 --> 41:04.728
There might be a lot
you don't know about her.

41:04.828 --> 41:07.831
It's time you learned.

41:44.368 --> 41:47.227
- Cotton! Cotton! Cotton!
- Hey, Cotton!

41:47.327 --> 41:49.640
Well, look who's in town.

41:49.940 --> 41:51.758
What are you doing here?

41:51.858 --> 41:56.213
My office is in the courthouse here.
What are you doing here?

41:56.313 --> 41:59.816
- Louisa gave us the day off.
- Oh, nice.

41:59.916 --> 42:03.520
Well, what's say you give me a couple
of hours and I'll take you all to lunch?

42:04.020 --> 42:06.690
We don't have a watch.

42:06.790 --> 42:08.792
Well...

42:09.659 --> 42:13.830
my father, he gave me this
when I first moved here.

42:13.930 --> 42:16.800
He told me I would have
a lot of time on my hands.

42:16.900 --> 42:20.204
I guess he wanted me
to keep track of it?

42:20.504 --> 42:24.790
How about you keep track of it.
Two hours. All right?

42:27.043 --> 42:30.548
Have fun. And Diamond,
you keep out of trouble, you hear?

42:35.919 --> 42:39.449
- How much for a slice of pie?
- A nickel.

42:41.525 --> 42:45.062
Hey you, get them dirty fingers
away from my pie.

42:45.862 --> 42:50.434
- Where you from boy? The mountain?
- No, I'm from the moon.

42:50.534 --> 42:54.671
You just march yourself on away from here.
Get back up the mountain where you belong.

42:54.971 --> 42:57.241
Hey, get! You little...

42:57.341 --> 42:59.693
Atta boy, Jeb.

42:59.793 --> 43:02.947
- Come on, Oz, let's go.
- Hey... why you leaving?

43:03.247 --> 43:07.216
Because... we're from the mountain, too.

43:16.192 --> 43:18.662
That's some mighty fine eatin', Cotton.

43:18.762 --> 43:22.366
- Yeah, I agree, Diamond. It's good food.
- Thanks, Cotton.

43:22.866 --> 43:26.403
- John!
- Hello, Mr. Cotton.

43:27.671 --> 43:28.872
What's going on?

43:28.972 --> 43:32.676
The coal business is gone.
I lost my job at the mine.

43:32.776 --> 43:35.279
You didn't sell
to Southern Valley, did you?

43:35.379 --> 43:36.980
Yes, sir, I did.

43:37.080 --> 43:40.951
Me and most of the people
on this side of the mountain.

43:41.051 --> 43:43.754
Well, take care.

43:43.854 --> 43:46.456
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

45:08.638 --> 45:10.675
Your parents were nice looking.

45:12.709 --> 45:14.578
Yeah, they was.

45:17.781 --> 45:20.450
Why didn't you tell me about them?

45:20.550 --> 45:22.753
Why should I?

45:24.288 --> 45:26.823
Because we're friends.

45:31.061 --> 45:33.922
I never knowed my mom, but...

45:34.664 --> 45:36.961
I try to think of what
her voice would be like.

45:44.608 --> 45:48.443
- It's hard not having parents.
- You still got a momma.

45:49.746 --> 45:51.748
No, I don't.

45:53.016 --> 45:56.153
Don't you ever give up
on a breathing body, Lou.

45:56.653 --> 45:57.786
Ever.

46:03.527 --> 46:06.363
You're good at telling stories.

46:06.463 --> 46:08.332
Maybe you should try writing.

46:08.432 --> 46:13.803
Shoot. I don't know no big words
except for Hallelujah.

46:16.506 --> 46:18.542
Thanks.

46:21.177 --> 46:25.549
You're a good friend.
You're like family.

46:25.699 --> 46:29.553
My daddy say that there are
two things in life you die for,

46:29.653 --> 46:32.856
friends and family.

46:32.956 --> 46:36.926
Sometimes they're one in the same.

46:40.530 --> 46:42.832
Maybe they are.

47:08.358 --> 47:09.931
What's that, Lou?

47:14.264 --> 47:16.111
Nothing important.

47:17.767 --> 47:19.302
"The wind ride on tree limbs,

47:19.402 --> 47:22.639
"the underbrush was thick
with sounds of stealthy movement

47:22.739 --> 47:27.844
"and the tall grass seemed to clutch
at the boy's pant legs.

47:27.944 --> 47:30.447
"The little boy was certain
that regiments of hobgoblins

47:30.547 --> 47:33.483
"were roaming nearby
in full terrifying splendor.

47:33.883 --> 47:37.454
"Yet something inside him had clearly
risen superior to these horrors.

47:37.554 --> 47:40.957
"For he did not once think
of turning back.

47:41.057 --> 47:42.597
"Well,

47:42.697 --> 47:46.563
maybe once, he admitted to himself.

47:46.663 --> 47:48.998
"Or perhaps twice.

47:49.098 --> 47:51.751
"He ran hard for a while,
making his way over the knolls,

47:51.851 --> 47:56.306
"navigating crisscross gullies and stumbling
through the jungle of dense woods.

47:56.406 --> 47:59.676
He cleared one last grove
of trees, stopped..."

48:02.746 --> 48:04.636
There's a diamond in here.

48:05.615 --> 48:09.052
- A diamond?
- Yep.

48:09.152 --> 48:12.722
Chip a little piece off it every day,

48:13.557 --> 48:15.792
and before you know it,

48:16.893 --> 48:20.130
it'll be the purtiest diamond
anyone ever saw.

48:20.230 --> 48:23.333
Maybe you could sell it
for a lot of money.

48:23.433 --> 48:25.034
I ain't need no money.

48:25.134 --> 48:28.671
Got everything I need,
right here on this mountain.

48:36.813 --> 48:39.182
What's going on over there?

48:40.316 --> 48:43.553
Well, coal company's got all the money,

48:43.653 --> 48:46.022
now they want all the land.

48:47.390 --> 48:49.593
You want to sell your property,
that's my price.

48:49.693 --> 48:51.461
Come on down...

48:51.561 --> 48:55.765
<i>It seemed everywhere I looked,
there were signs going up.</i>

48:55.865 --> 48:59.869
<i>Sold to Southern Valley Coal.</i>

49:00.737 --> 49:04.841
<i>Diamond never forgave the coal company
for what they did to his father.</i>

49:05.441 --> 49:08.511
<i>Or for what they were doing
to the mountain.</i>

49:10.880 --> 49:13.684
Don't you even think about it,
Diamond Skinner.

49:17.654 --> 49:19.589
I be seeing you!

49:19.689 --> 49:23.326
- What was that all about?
- Nothing you have to worry about.

49:23.426 --> 49:25.395
- Who was that?
- Judd Wheeler.

49:25.795 --> 49:29.332
He owns a coal company
that killed my dad.

49:33.469 --> 49:35.572
Y'all know about the stars?

49:35.672 --> 49:40.943
Yeah. That's Big Dipper and Pegasus.

49:41.511 --> 49:44.147
Ain't heard of those, but...

49:44.314 --> 49:47.717
there's the Bear that's missing one leg.

49:49.285 --> 49:52.955
And over there,
that's the stone chimney.

49:53.990 --> 49:56.428
You sure do know a lot
about stars, Diamond.

49:57.393 --> 50:01.965
Well, when you're up here
in the mountains, you're closer to 'em.

50:02.065 --> 50:05.334
You get to see 'em better
than other folks.

50:17.113 --> 50:21.918
There's coal in that there rock.
Pickaxe can't do job.

50:22.018 --> 50:25.021
You gotta use dynamite.

50:25.121 --> 50:29.008
- Is it dangerous?
- No. Done it myself.

50:29.108 --> 50:31.494
But if you ain't careful,
you can blow yourself up good.

50:31.594 --> 50:36.233
You know, after it blows, maybe I could
take you in, show you around.

50:37.734 --> 50:39.869
You should think about coming
to live with us.

50:39.969 --> 50:42.805
You could be my big brother.

50:43.673 --> 50:45.319
Maybe I will.

50:48.328 --> 50:50.730
Jeb! Jeb, stop! Come back here!

50:51.080 --> 50:53.316
- Jeb! Diamond!
- Jeb, come here!

50:53.416 --> 50:56.765
- Come back here, Jeb!
- Diamond, wait now. Stop!

50:56.865 --> 50:59.989
- No! Lou, no!
- Hey. Wait here, Ms. Lou.

51:00.089 --> 51:01.791
- Come here, boy!
- I'll get him.

51:01.891 --> 51:03.956
Jeb, come back!

51:04.056 --> 51:06.396
- Come out of there!
- Come on now! Come on!

51:06.496 --> 51:07.934
Diamond!

51:24.013 --> 51:25.355
Eugene!

51:26.750 --> 51:31.054
Eugene, where is he? Where is he?
Where's Diamond? Eugene, where is he?

51:31.154 --> 51:33.756
Sorry, Ms. Lou.

51:36.292 --> 51:38.331
Diamond!

51:38.431 --> 51:40.296
Diamond!

51:40.396 --> 51:42.048
Ms. Lou.

51:42.148 --> 51:44.367
Okay.

51:44.467 --> 51:46.725
It's okay.

51:54.978 --> 51:58.181
People pass and it's natural,

51:58.281 --> 52:01.684
the old making way for the new,

52:04.387 --> 52:07.523
but when a child dies,

52:09.959 --> 52:13.429
it just turns everything upside down.

52:16.700 --> 52:19.335
I don't know much,

52:19.435 --> 52:22.138
but I do know that...

52:22.672 --> 52:24.841
Diamond's up there

52:24.941 --> 52:28.477
right now, telling God a story.

52:29.679 --> 52:32.682
And God is laughing.

52:35.251 --> 52:39.022
And that's all any of us
need to carry in our hearts

52:39.122 --> 52:41.858
about this young man.

53:50.493 --> 53:53.029
I can close my eyes and wish...

53:54.330 --> 53:56.366
and wish,

53:56.466 --> 54:01.704
but you are never coming back.

56:02.491 --> 56:05.995
- Where you going?
- Going to send a letter.

56:06.095 --> 56:08.097
In your nightgown?

56:29.719 --> 56:32.421
A lot to take to market.

56:33.389 --> 56:35.046
What do you want?

56:39.562 --> 56:42.565
Hey, Billy.
Hey, you know you're just in time.

56:42.665 --> 56:45.768
I was just saying what are we
gonna do with all this food?

56:45.868 --> 56:48.071
Come on over here and take this home.

56:48.571 --> 56:51.941
Lou, put this one on Billy's cart.

56:53.409 --> 56:58.281
And if your daddy say anything about this
you tell him to come talk to me.

56:58.381 --> 57:03.019
Before long, Ms. Louisa,
I won't care what my pa says.

57:12.295 --> 57:17.666
It's not fair. George Davis sells
his crops and we feed his family?

57:18.734 --> 57:21.137
I'll tell you what's fair,

57:21.237 --> 57:26.309
a momma and her babies having
food to eat. That's what's fair.

57:26.409 --> 57:28.711
You remember that.

57:49.265 --> 57:51.700
What are those?

57:51.834 --> 57:53.550
Just some old letters from Mom.

58:03.412 --> 58:06.282
Would you read them to me?

58:09.919 --> 58:13.289
All right. Just one.

58:24.734 --> 58:28.671
"Dear Louisa, I hope you are doing well.

58:29.338 --> 58:33.943
"Oz is over the whooping cough
and is finally sleeping through the night."

58:34.863 --> 58:38.614
Me! She wrote about me!

58:40.149 --> 58:42.718
"Your great granddaughter is amazing."

58:42.818 --> 58:46.289
<i>Your great granddaughter
is amazing, Louisa.</i>

58:46.389 --> 58:48.424
<i>Her mind is so quick.</i>

58:48.524 --> 58:52.361
<i>I'm afraid she finds me a little boring.</i>

58:52.728 --> 58:57.466
I know she wants more than anything
to be a writer like her father,

58:57.566 --> 59:02.705
but she needs to understand that
every writer has to find their own voice.

59:04.273 --> 59:06.842
But when Lou opens up her heart

59:06.942 --> 59:10.780
and lets the words pour from her

59:10.880 --> 59:12.348
I know the world will have another

59:12.448 --> 59:16.618
mighty fine writer... named Cardinal.

59:23.392 --> 59:26.194
That was a good letter.

59:31.534 --> 59:33.502
Good night, Oz.

59:33.602 --> 59:35.838
Night, Lou.

01:00:18.381 --> 01:00:21.048
I guarantee you it's going to be
a Jim dandy of a Christmas now,

01:00:21.148 --> 01:00:22.451
I'm telling you.

01:00:22.551 --> 01:00:26.454
With the gas we're gonna get out of this,
this hole in the ground here...

01:00:26.704 --> 01:00:28.023
Hey!

01:00:28.799 --> 01:00:31.961
- Let me go! Please! Please!
- George!

01:00:32.061 --> 01:00:33.674
What is going on up there?

01:00:34.530 --> 01:00:37.066
What... What is going on here?

01:00:39.034 --> 01:00:41.600
Louisa's kin.

01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:43.639
Think she heard?

01:00:43.739 --> 01:00:45.774
Don't know.

01:00:55.684 --> 01:00:59.422
Ms. Cardinal. I'm Judd Wheeler,
President of Southern Valley.

01:00:59.922 --> 01:01:02.425
He pays you to steal
other people's land.

01:01:02.525 --> 01:01:04.460
You're a little bit
of a problem now, aren't you?

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:06.162
- If you were my daughter...
- She's not!

01:01:06.262 --> 01:01:09.331
Now let's calm damn, folks.
It's just business.

01:01:09.431 --> 01:01:13.035
Well, then it's good I've got
my lawyer here, isn't it?

01:01:13.135 --> 01:01:18.874
Ms. Cardinal, I'm happy to offer you
fifty thousand dollars for your property.

01:01:21.176 --> 01:01:24.880
Well, that offer is for the underlying
mineral rights only, of course.

01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:28.384
No. I've got bigger plans
for her property.

01:01:28.484 --> 01:01:31.187
It's the perfect location.
I don't see one negative.

01:01:31.287 --> 01:01:34.490
Well, except I ain't sellin' it to you.

01:01:34.590 --> 01:01:38.828
My company is looking to make
a substantial investment here.

01:01:38.928 --> 01:01:41.164
Now how can you stand
in the way of that?

01:01:41.264 --> 01:01:43.565
On my own two feet.

01:01:44.066 --> 01:01:46.902
Louisa, you'd be rich.

01:01:47.002 --> 01:01:51.573
No, I wouldn't. I'd just have
a whole bunch of money I don't need.

01:01:52.074 --> 01:01:55.811
- Louisa, you's crazy.
- Well, then you sell him your land.

01:01:55.911 --> 01:01:58.931
They can't get to my land
without crossing your property!

01:01:59.031 --> 01:02:02.126
Well, that's not my problem, is it?

01:02:02.426 --> 01:02:06.055
- Fool woman!
- You get goin' now.

01:02:06.155 --> 01:02:08.657
That was a lot of money.

01:02:09.125 --> 01:02:10.260
Well,

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:14.397
one thing you got to remember
about these coal people,

01:02:14.497 --> 01:02:17.600
and I told this to your daddy, too,

01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:20.936
they got one job on this earth

01:02:21.036 --> 01:02:24.540
and that's stealing the sun.

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:27.843
Because once they get through
destroying our land,

01:02:27.943 --> 01:02:32.548
there gonna be no need for no more sun.

01:02:38.887 --> 01:02:41.557
Well, thank you, Myrtle.

01:02:44.535 --> 01:02:48.863
Land doesn't look nearly
as free on paper, does it?

01:02:49.519 --> 01:02:52.167
No, Ms. Louisa, it don't.

01:02:52.618 --> 01:02:55.571
But George Davis was right,
he's land locked.

01:02:55.671 --> 01:02:58.708
They gotta cross your land
or he ain't gonna get nothin'.

01:02:59.408 --> 01:03:04.196
That damn coal company
is not gonna get my farm

01:03:04.296 --> 01:03:07.616
and destroy the mountain
and ruin the land.

01:03:07.716 --> 01:03:10.001
Not while I'm...

01:03:12.121 --> 01:03:14.323
You all right?

01:03:14.423 --> 01:03:16.220
Is there a chair?

01:03:20.429 --> 01:03:23.022
- There you go.
- Thank you.

01:03:26.602 --> 01:03:29.671
Those children are gonna need you.

01:03:30.305 --> 01:03:33.642
I ain't know how to take care
of Lou and Oz.

01:03:33.742 --> 01:03:37.112
Sure you do. You've been
taking care of me for years.

01:03:37.212 --> 01:03:38.981
They need their momma.

01:03:39.081 --> 01:03:43.186
No, no, no, they just need someone
to love 'em and take care of 'em.

01:03:43.986 --> 01:03:48.091
Even if I could take care of 'em,
ain't nobody gonna let me do it.

01:03:50.092 --> 01:03:55.597
Eugene, when I took you in,
you were just a little boy.

01:03:56.146 --> 01:03:58.968
Scared of his own shadow.

01:03:59.068 --> 01:04:01.737
Look at you now.

01:04:02.004 --> 01:04:06.775
What a fine human being you are.

01:04:07.142 --> 01:04:10.378
You're gonna show 'em the way.

01:04:36.388 --> 01:04:38.790
What are you doing here?

01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:42.376
You tell that old woman...

01:04:43.178 --> 01:04:45.548
she better sell this place.

01:04:45.648 --> 01:04:47.955
Get off our land! Now!

01:04:51.854 --> 01:04:54.388
You leave my sister alone!

01:04:54.790 --> 01:04:57.242
You damn bastard. Come here!

01:04:57.342 --> 01:04:59.678
Come here, you little bastards!

01:05:02.331 --> 01:05:07.369
Hell No. You touch a white man, boy?

01:05:11.507 --> 01:05:14.009
You know that ain't never been my name.

01:05:14.109 --> 01:05:17.646
It be Eugene Randall.

01:05:17.746 --> 01:05:21.216
Don't you never call me nothin' else.

01:05:25.588 --> 01:05:28.156
Thank you, Eugene.

01:05:30.175 --> 01:05:31.524
Go on now.

01:05:48.177 --> 01:05:51.313
I want to read you one of my stories.

01:05:53.415 --> 01:05:55.384
"It was a pretty fall day

01:05:55.484 --> 01:05:58.854
"and the leaves were yellow and red.

01:05:58.954 --> 01:06:01.290
"A little girl was running.

01:06:01.390 --> 01:06:05.160
"At last, she could see
the big house on the hill.

01:06:06.895 --> 01:06:10.099
She didn't live there,
but she always wanted to."

01:06:10.699 --> 01:06:13.602
Lou! This came for you
from the magazine!

01:06:17.572 --> 01:06:19.941
Okay, Oz.

01:06:26.248 --> 01:06:28.450
Louisa!

01:06:28.651 --> 01:06:30.503
Louisa!

01:06:30.903 --> 01:06:32.091
Louisa, look!

01:06:35.157 --> 01:06:37.204
A hundred dollars?

01:06:37.993 --> 01:06:41.702
I am so proud of you.
Congratulations, honey.

01:06:41.802 --> 01:06:43.794
Thank you.

01:06:43.894 --> 01:06:47.365
- A hundred dollars is a lot of money.
- It sure is.

01:06:51.306 --> 01:06:53.558
Here you go.

01:07:00.284 --> 01:07:03.852
That is a mighty fine story, Lou.

01:07:04.987 --> 01:07:09.625
Diamond would have been real proud.
Plus, you get to pay a few bills?

01:07:09.725 --> 01:07:13.328
So how does it feel
to sell your first story?

01:07:14.396 --> 01:07:16.632
I was wondering how my dad felt.

01:07:17.132 --> 01:07:20.102
Well, I'm sure he felt
exactly like you feel right now.

01:07:22.137 --> 01:07:24.672
How about I treat you to lunch?

01:07:25.599 --> 01:07:27.809
I'd be honored.

01:07:56.271 --> 01:07:58.807
You finish your homework?

01:07:58.907 --> 01:08:00.909
Yeah.

01:08:04.079 --> 01:08:06.081
What?

01:08:08.183 --> 01:08:12.096
I need to know why my dad
never came back here.

01:08:40.948 --> 01:08:44.386
This is your daddy's father and mother,

01:08:44.553 --> 01:08:47.288
my son, Jacob,

01:08:47.389 --> 01:08:51.059
and his wife, Susan.

01:08:52.394 --> 01:08:54.763
Susan run off and left Jacob.

01:08:54.863 --> 01:08:57.832
And when your daddy was just a...

01:08:57.933 --> 01:08:59.669
a young'un.

01:09:00.469 --> 01:09:03.438
I guess the mountain
didn't agree with her.

01:09:06.575 --> 01:09:12.147
I can still hear your daddy's voice
calling her... over and over.

01:09:12.247 --> 01:09:17.085
"I want my mother!"

01:09:20.956 --> 01:09:23.304
And Jacob,

01:09:24.593 --> 01:09:28.087
he just never got over her leaving.

01:09:29.264 --> 01:09:33.268
Your daddy and I watched
a man we both love

01:09:34.036 --> 01:09:38.439
die... a little bit every day

01:09:39.908 --> 01:09:43.044
until there was just...

01:09:43.946 --> 01:09:46.781
nothing left of him.

01:09:48.317 --> 01:09:51.053
It was hard...

01:09:51.153 --> 01:09:53.455
watching my...

01:09:53.921 --> 01:09:56.491
my son die.

01:09:58.060 --> 01:10:02.998
But it was harder on your daddy,

01:10:03.498 --> 01:10:06.468
losing first his mother

01:10:06.702 --> 01:10:09.337
and then his father.

01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:20.416
You know, I loved your daddy as much
as I loved anything in this whole world,

01:10:22.551 --> 01:10:26.674
but I understand why he didn't
wanna come back here,

01:10:26.774 --> 01:10:29.707
the place where...

01:10:30.292 --> 01:10:34.162
all that sorrow got a hold of him.

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:41.403
I tried to help him,

01:10:41.503 --> 01:10:43.705
I really did,

01:10:44.139 --> 01:10:46.208
but...

01:10:48.410 --> 01:10:50.736
I failed.

01:10:51.379 --> 01:10:56.186
I just... I just failed him.

01:10:59.654 --> 01:11:01.390
No.

01:11:01.490 --> 01:11:04.360
He... he named me after you.

01:11:07.329 --> 01:11:08.850
And this.

01:11:13.902 --> 01:11:16.404
My dad's last book.

01:11:20.308 --> 01:11:23.125
Open it to the first page.

01:11:28.617 --> 01:11:31.954
"To Louisa Mae Cardinal,

01:11:32.054 --> 01:11:34.756
"the one who showed me...

01:11:36.792 --> 01:11:39.572
light from the dark."

01:11:56.845 --> 01:11:58.819
Thank you.

01:12:02.918 --> 01:12:05.187
Thank you.

01:12:26.708 --> 01:12:28.477
Hey, Billy!

01:12:40.722 --> 01:12:43.565
Come here! Come here, you! Get.

01:12:46.929 --> 01:12:48.947
Come on!

01:12:56.238 --> 01:12:59.241
The next one that touches
Eugene is dead.

01:12:59.641 --> 01:13:02.444
Hang on a second. Crazy woman.

01:13:10.418 --> 01:13:13.021
Thank you for coming to tell us.

01:13:13.121 --> 01:13:16.024
What? Louisa, what's wrong?

01:13:17.259 --> 01:13:20.161
- Louisa!
- Ms. Louisa!

01:13:20.729 --> 01:13:22.998
Ms. Louisa!

01:13:26.201 --> 01:13:31.339
She's resting now,
but she's had a stroke.

01:13:34.709 --> 01:13:35.999
It'll be fine.

01:13:37.545 --> 01:13:39.981
She'll be fine.

01:14:08.476 --> 01:14:11.546
Afternoon, Wheeler.
What can I do for ya?

01:14:11.966 --> 01:14:14.382
Coal's run out.

01:14:17.686 --> 01:14:19.421
Town's going to hell.

01:14:19.521 --> 01:14:21.723
Well,

01:14:21.823 --> 01:14:26.027
every lick of coal and gas
could disappear from this earth

01:14:26.127 --> 01:14:28.326
and Louisa will be just fine.

01:14:29.264 --> 01:14:32.234
I'm... raisin' my offer.

01:14:32.334 --> 01:14:35.637
I assume you have power of attorney.

01:14:35.904 --> 01:14:38.506
No, I don't.

01:14:38.907 --> 01:14:40.225
Anything else?

01:14:42.911 --> 01:14:45.613
Consider yourself served.

01:15:11.639 --> 01:15:14.843
<i>The coal company was trying
to declare Louisa incompetent</i>

01:15:16.478 --> 01:15:19.347
<i>so that they could take her land.</i>

01:15:22.117 --> 01:15:23.842
<i>But her mind was still with us.</i>

01:15:25.487 --> 01:15:28.190
<i>Even if she couldn't speak,</i>

01:15:28.290 --> 01:15:30.592
<i>her eyes were telling me</i>

01:15:30.692 --> 01:15:32.761
<i>not to be afraid.</i>

01:16:01.756 --> 01:16:04.159
- Good luck.
- Well, thank you, Lou.

01:16:04.259 --> 01:16:06.677
You ready to have a go at this?

01:16:06.777 --> 01:16:09.043
As ready as you are.

01:16:09.143 --> 01:16:12.200
I seriously doubt that.

01:16:15.603 --> 01:16:16.871
Judge.

01:16:16.971 --> 01:16:21.810
Judge, George Davis has a vested
interest in the outcome of this case.

01:16:23.378 --> 01:16:25.213
- George?
- Yes?

01:16:25.313 --> 01:16:28.150
Can you keep a fair
and open mind about this case?

01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:30.751
Sure, Henry.

01:16:30.851 --> 01:16:32.220
Sure I can.

01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:35.890
Me and Louisa, we're like good friends.
We get along good.

01:16:35.990 --> 01:16:39.247
- He's lying!
- Oz, sit down.

01:16:40.695 --> 01:16:42.380
He's a sweet boy.

01:16:43.765 --> 01:16:49.204
Doctor Ross, can you state
your fine credentials for the jury?

01:16:49.304 --> 01:16:53.275
I'm chief of the psychiatric department
at the county hospital.

01:16:53.375 --> 01:16:57.512
And I've handled
more than 500 cases like this one.

01:16:57.612 --> 01:17:02.284
And what, in your expert opinion,

01:17:02.684 --> 01:17:04.452
is Ms. Cardinal's condition?

01:17:04.552 --> 01:17:07.464
She should be institutionalized.

01:17:08.289 --> 01:17:10.292
No further questions.

01:17:10.892 --> 01:17:12.460
Mr. Longfellow.

01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:14.028
Doctor,

01:17:14.228 --> 01:17:18.733
how many of the people that you have
examined have you found to be incompetent?

01:17:18.833 --> 01:17:21.503
A hundred percent? Ninety five?

01:17:21.603 --> 01:17:24.305
Ninety five sounds about right.

01:17:25.123 --> 01:17:28.242
That is a lot of crazy people.

01:17:29.711 --> 01:17:32.881
I just call 'em like I see 'em, lawyer.

01:17:32.981 --> 01:17:35.817
Yeah, I'm sure that you do.

01:17:39.454 --> 01:17:43.057
How many stroke victims

01:17:43.157 --> 01:17:48.997
that you have examined have you found
to be mentally incompetent?

01:17:49.097 --> 01:17:52.133
None that I can recall.

01:17:52.233 --> 01:17:53.812
So even though one

01:17:53.912 --> 01:17:59.173
may not be able to talk or move,
she may fully understand what is going on.

01:17:59.273 --> 01:18:03.459
In fact, over time, Ms. Cardinal
may have a complete recovery.

01:18:03.559 --> 01:18:05.313
I doubt that.

01:18:05.413 --> 01:18:09.351
Since you yourself admitted that
you are not an expert in stroke victims,

01:18:09.451 --> 01:18:13.654
I would like that last statement
removed from the record.

01:18:13.888 --> 01:18:16.846
You are hereby instructed

01:18:16.946 --> 01:18:21.696
to disregard that last
statement of Dr. Ross.

01:18:22.163 --> 01:18:24.699
No more questions.

01:18:28.303 --> 01:18:30.381
Judge...

01:18:31.806 --> 01:18:36.644
Ms. Cardinal, when she gets better,
can take care of her own affairs.

01:18:36.744 --> 01:18:39.147
She won't have any land left.

01:18:39.247 --> 01:18:44.753
Well, I think she can take comfort
in the hundred thousand dollars

01:18:44.853 --> 01:18:48.623
that Southern Valley has offered her.

01:18:49.691 --> 01:18:55.964
Judge? Judge, he has just... just as good
as bribed this jury and the whole town.

01:18:56.064 --> 01:18:59.318
I withdraw the statement.

01:19:05.073 --> 01:19:09.644
<i>" Three cows lay in the grass
in one protected space</i>

01:19:09.744 --> 01:19:15.016
<i>"while a Rhone horse grazed alone
in a small snake rail corral.</i>

01:19:15.116 --> 01:19:18.919
<i>"And rising high above all this</i>

01:19:19.354 --> 01:19:21.415
<i>were the Appalachians."</i>

01:19:34.302 --> 01:19:37.972
Ms. Amanda, you need to come back to us.

01:19:39.173 --> 01:19:42.176
For more reasons than you know.

01:19:49.851 --> 01:19:52.920
<i>Memories are a funny thing.</i>

01:19:53.755 --> 01:19:56.973
<i>People like to change the past
so they can remember</i>

01:19:57.073 --> 01:19:59.991
<i>what it is they want to remember.</i>

01:20:14.509 --> 01:20:16.944
<i>Not now, Amanda!</i>

01:20:17.044 --> 01:20:21.616
<i>We can't live off awards, Jack,
unless we move to Virginia.</i>

01:20:21.816 --> 01:20:24.179
- <i>Leaving New York?</i>
- <i>Not now, Lou!</i>

01:20:24.279 --> 01:20:26.353
- I don't want to move!
- I said not now!

01:20:54.949 --> 01:20:58.586
It wasn't your fault that dad died.

01:21:02.824 --> 01:21:05.292
It was mine.

01:21:11.566 --> 01:21:13.968
I love you.

01:21:43.698 --> 01:21:46.801
She's gonna lose the farm, isn't she?

01:21:48.736 --> 01:21:50.666
Well,

01:21:51.572 --> 01:21:56.310
sometimes you can't get justice
even in a court of law, Lou.

01:22:07.388 --> 01:22:10.224
I think I just got my miracle.

01:22:10.692 --> 01:22:14.995
Your Honor, I call Eugene Randall.

01:22:21.903 --> 01:22:23.897
<i>Cotton found his miracle.</i>

01:22:24.839 --> 01:22:29.076
<i>He put Southern Valley on trial
for Diamond's death.</i>

01:22:34.549 --> 01:22:39.120
How many times do you reckon
you used dynamite in that mine?

01:22:40.822 --> 01:22:43.324
Fifty times or more.

01:22:43.758 --> 01:22:46.092
Well, I'd say that makes you an expert.

01:22:48.896 --> 01:22:51.933
And after you set the dynamite

01:22:52.033 --> 01:22:54.135
what did you do?

01:22:54.235 --> 01:22:57.839
Well the... the shaft curves
in a couple of different places

01:22:57.939 --> 01:23:03.211
so I usually just wait around
the curve or go outside.

01:23:03.311 --> 01:23:06.414
When the dynamite exploded,

01:23:06.514 --> 01:23:07.716
where were you?

01:23:08.216 --> 01:23:11.352
Forty feet in.
Not even to the first curve.

01:23:11.452 --> 01:23:13.755
Throwed me ten feet.

01:23:13.855 --> 01:23:16.390
And where did you set the dynamite?

01:23:16.490 --> 01:23:21.262
Well, past the second curve.
Two hundred twenty feet in.

01:23:21.362 --> 01:23:24.598
And where did you find Diamond's body?

01:23:26.801 --> 01:23:29.836
Another 40 feet in.

01:23:30.872 --> 01:23:32.924
And in your expert opinion,

01:23:33.024 --> 01:23:35.577
do you think that there is any way

01:23:35.677 --> 01:23:40.548
that that dynamite could have thrown
Diamond's body that far?

01:23:40.648 --> 01:23:42.784
No, sir.

01:23:46.821 --> 01:23:49.356
Thank you, Eugene.

01:23:50.425 --> 01:23:52.860
Nothing further.

01:24:01.703 --> 01:24:04.005
You ever been to school, boy?

01:24:05.239 --> 01:24:08.149
There ain't no school for colored here.

01:24:08.843 --> 01:24:12.013
And yet you're up here
testifying under oath

01:24:12.113 --> 01:24:15.016
to all these precise distances.

01:24:15.116 --> 01:24:17.351
Yes, sir.

01:24:17.752 --> 01:24:20.321
Now how can that be
for an uneducated colored man

01:24:20.421 --> 01:24:26.026
who has never even added one plus one
under the eyes of a teacher?

01:24:26.794 --> 01:24:29.563
Ms. Louisa taught me.

01:24:29.663 --> 01:24:32.366
And I handy with saw and hammer.

01:24:32.466 --> 01:24:36.037
Now you cut a three foot board
to fill a four foot space

01:24:36.137 --> 01:24:38.106
what exactly have you done?

01:24:38.706 --> 01:24:40.425
But...

01:24:40.525 --> 01:24:44.445
in a dark mine how can you be
so sure of the distances, boy?

01:24:44.545 --> 01:24:50.451
I painted the walls in that mine
in ten foot parcels over 400 feet in.

01:24:50.551 --> 01:24:52.987
You can see 'em as clear as day.

01:24:53.087 --> 01:24:55.657
And you can put down
what I done said here

01:24:55.757 --> 01:24:58.193
as the word of the Lord.

01:25:01.695 --> 01:25:03.765
Are you done with the witness?

01:25:04.957 --> 01:25:07.272
I have no further questions, your Honor.

01:25:10.137 --> 01:25:12.173
You're excused, Mr. Randall.

01:25:12.673 --> 01:25:17.244
The court thanks you
for your expert testimony.

01:25:17.745 --> 01:25:20.734
You heard Eugene testify.

01:25:21.549 --> 01:25:24.118
Now under those circumstances,

01:25:24.218 --> 01:25:27.989
is there any way
that that dynamite charge

01:25:28.089 --> 01:25:31.092
could have caused
those injuries to Diamond?

01:25:31.192 --> 01:25:32.726
That would have been impossible.

01:25:32.826 --> 01:25:36.297
Have you ever seen
injuries like that before?

01:25:36.397 --> 01:25:39.734
There was an explosion
at a manufacturing company,

01:25:39.834 --> 01:25:41.936
12 men were killed.

01:25:42.036 --> 01:25:44.239
And what caused that explosion?

01:25:44.839 --> 01:25:46.269
Natural gas leak.

01:25:47.642 --> 01:25:50.444
Natural gas leak.

01:25:52.446 --> 01:25:55.249
Nothing further, your Honor.

01:25:58.486 --> 01:26:01.689
You found natural gas

01:26:01.789 --> 01:26:05.359
on Ms. Cardinal's property, didn't you?

01:26:05.459 --> 01:26:07.828
Yeah, that's right.

01:26:08.696 --> 01:26:13.434
And why didn't you post signs saying
that there was gas in there?

01:26:13.701 --> 01:26:17.705
We... we didn't want people to know
what we were doing up there.

01:26:17.805 --> 01:26:23.010
Because you wanted to buy her land
for a lot less than it was worth.

01:26:23.110 --> 01:26:26.147
Why didn't you come forward
when Diamond Skinner was killed, sir?

01:26:29.550 --> 01:26:30.685
Answer the question.

01:26:30.785 --> 01:26:35.422
Why didn't you come forward
after Diamond Skinner was killed?

01:26:37.725 --> 01:26:43.197
- Why didn't you come forward...
- I didn't want the boy to die like that!

01:26:43.297 --> 01:26:45.333
It was...

01:26:45.433 --> 01:26:48.268
It was just business.

01:26:49.236 --> 01:26:51.805
Well, he did die.

01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:55.609
Just like that.

01:27:43.858 --> 01:27:46.594
Let me give you good folks the...

01:27:46.694 --> 01:27:50.547
legal side of this case
and it's not complicated.

01:27:50.647 --> 01:27:55.653
Like a good birddog,
it points in one direction

01:27:55.803 --> 01:27:58.039
and one direction only.

01:27:59.740 --> 01:28:03.477
Southern Valley killed Diamond Skinner.

01:28:03.577 --> 01:28:08.950
And now they seek to use the tragedy
of Louisa Mae to take her land.

01:28:10.852 --> 01:28:12.586
The law clearly states...

01:28:12.686 --> 01:28:17.758
that one cannot profit
from one's misdeeds.

01:28:17.858 --> 01:28:21.662
Now if what Southern Valley did
does not qualify as a misdeed

01:28:21.762 --> 01:28:24.532
then there is nothing
on this earth that does.

01:28:26.500 --> 01:28:29.771
You can pull the gas
out of the mountain,

01:28:29.871 --> 01:28:31.806
but in time,

01:28:31.906 --> 01:28:34.742
just like the coal, it will be gone.

01:28:34.842 --> 01:28:37.678
And so will Southern Valley.

01:28:39.180 --> 01:28:41.482
You want a savior?

01:28:43.217 --> 01:28:46.654
Then look to yourselves,
rely on each other,

01:28:46.754 --> 01:28:51.258
just as Louisa Mae
has been doing her whole life.

01:28:52.459 --> 01:28:54.728
For her, the resources of the land
are never exhausted

01:28:54.828 --> 01:28:59.137
because she never tried
to tear its soul out.

01:29:01.435 --> 01:29:03.871
And her reward

01:29:03.971 --> 01:29:09.009
is to live a decent, honest life...

01:29:10.277 --> 01:29:13.480
for as long as she desires.

01:29:14.482 --> 01:29:17.117
I want to say something.

01:29:23.757 --> 01:29:27.161
You know she would never sell her land

01:29:27.261 --> 01:29:30.964
'cause that land is like her family.

01:29:32.666 --> 01:29:37.437
It may not seem like much
to those who want to destroy it,

01:29:38.005 --> 01:29:40.708
but it means everything

01:29:40.808 --> 01:29:44.111
to the people who call
the mountain home.

01:30:06.567 --> 01:30:10.570
The reason I came here
was because of my dad,

01:30:15.476 --> 01:30:18.478
but I want to stay here now

01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:20.634
because of you.

01:30:37.130 --> 01:30:40.133
I found this in your closet.

01:30:42.436 --> 01:30:45.472
I thought you'd like to have it.

01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:21.876
All rise.

01:31:26.847 --> 01:31:28.351
Be seated.

01:31:34.255 --> 01:31:35.908
What say you?

01:31:41.262 --> 01:31:43.916
We find for Southern Valley.

01:31:44.016 --> 01:31:46.034
Hallelujah!

01:31:46.134 --> 01:31:48.735
Well done, counselor.

01:32:01.182 --> 01:32:03.584
We will appeal. Don't worry.

01:32:03.684 --> 01:32:05.753
That was... that was really good.
Real good.

01:32:05.853 --> 01:32:09.162
- Thank you for your vote of confidence.
- Thank you.

01:34:47.981 --> 01:34:49.332
<i>I will always believe</i>

01:34:49.432 --> 01:34:53.790
<i>that Louisa gave her life so our mother
could come back to us.</i>

01:35:01.828 --> 01:35:07.567
<i>And maybe it didn't hurt that a little girl
told her mom she loved her.</i>

01:35:13.006 --> 01:35:16.543
<i>With our mother back,
we didn't have to sell the farm.</i>

01:35:16.643 --> 01:35:21.014
<i>And Cotton sued Southern Valley
for Diamond's death.</i>

01:35:21.114 --> 01:35:26.453
<i>Since we were the only family he had,
the money went to us</i>

01:35:27.187 --> 01:35:32.357
<i>and Diamond still lives here,
in a place I know he loved.</i>

01:35:35.228 --> 01:35:39.199
<i>My mother and Cotton
were married a year later.</i>

01:35:39.299 --> 01:35:42.769
<i>They spent four wonderful
decades together</i>

01:35:42.869 --> 01:35:46.673
<i>and died within a week of each other.</i>

01:35:49.943 --> 01:35:54.715
<i>Like my father, I left the mountain,
but I came back.</i>

01:35:55.015 --> 01:35:57.618
<i>I married and raised a family here</i>

01:35:57.718 --> 01:36:01.489
<i>and I started writing novels
just as my father had.</i>

01:36:02.389 --> 01:36:05.259
<i>And though I never won
the sorts of awards he did,</i>

01:36:05.359 --> 01:36:10.680
<i>my books tended to sell a little better.</i>

01:36:14.034 --> 01:36:19.773
<i>It's a true comfort to know
that I will die here on the high rock...</i>

01:36:23.377 --> 01:36:27.067
<i>and I will fear my passing not at all,</i>

01:36:30.183 --> 01:36:33.238
<i>for the view from here...</i>

01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:37.691
<i>is so very fine.</i>
