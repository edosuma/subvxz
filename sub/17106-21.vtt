NARRATOR: Previously
on Dance Academy.

00:03.680 --> 00:06.480
-All it was was just a
nice, simple crush.

00:06.519 --> 00:07.280
-Just stop.

00:07.320 --> 00:08.439
Well, you know what?

00:08.480 --> 00:09.679
I'm going to like you if
I want to like you.

00:09.720 --> 00:11.160
And there's nothing you
can do about it.

00:11.199 --> 00:11.679
-Fine.

00:11.720 --> 00:12.359
Like me then.

00:12.400 --> 00:14.480
-Fine, I will.

00:14.519 --> 00:15.279
-I'm not doing this dance.

00:15.320 --> 00:16.679
-Darling, you're just tired.

00:16.719 --> 00:19.039
And you are run down.

00:19.079 --> 00:20.719
No doubt from rehearsing that
ridiculous musical.

00:20.760 --> 00:22.199
-It's not ridiculous.

00:22.239 --> 00:24.280
And it makes me happy.

00:24.320 --> 00:25.559
-I know what makes you happy.

00:25.600 --> 00:28.480
I have sacrificed everything
for your happiness.

00:28.519 --> 00:29.160
-Finn, hi.

00:29.199 --> 00:30.640
It's me.

00:30.679 --> 00:33.439
Um, you're going to have
to find a replacement.

00:33.479 --> 00:35.640
Just, rehearsals were
interfering too much.

00:35.679 --> 00:38.039
-This is for the teachers at
the Academy, for always

00:38.079 --> 00:39.399
overlooking.

00:39.439 --> 00:41.039
And that's for my dad.

00:41.079 --> 00:43.320
I'm in the Nationals at
the Prix de Fonteyn.

00:43.359 --> 00:45.200
Book a ticket.

00:45.240 --> 00:47.600
[theme music]

01:36.519 --> 01:38.439
NARRATOR: It's here.

01:38.480 --> 01:42.719
After nine months of training
and agonizing over our solos,

01:42.760 --> 01:44.760
the national finals of
the Prix de Fonteyn.

01:44.799 --> 01:46.120
Judgment day.

01:50.359 --> 01:52.799
Only two girls and two boys out
of the entire country will

01:52.840 --> 01:54.200
make it through to the
Internationals.

02:31.159 --> 02:33.520
And the worst part?

02:33.560 --> 02:36.120
That all of our technique, our
artistry, our individuality?

02:38.680 --> 02:41.599
The judges take these hard
earned things and transform

02:41.639 --> 02:45.400
them into cold, unforgiving
numbers.

02:45.439 --> 02:49.680
-Grace Whitney, National
Academy, classical round.

02:49.719 --> 02:53.199
7.7.

02:53.240 --> 02:57.560
7.6.

02:57.599 --> 03:01.639
7.5.

03:01.680 --> 03:10.800
7.6.

03:10.840 --> 03:15.479
6.9.

03:15.520 --> 03:16.759
8.9.

03:16.800 --> 03:19.680
Thank you Michael Slade,
Tasmanian School of Dance.

03:26.639 --> 03:28.800
-Guess Slade has spoken.

03:28.840 --> 03:30.159
-Beat that.

03:35.080 --> 03:36.360
-Zach who appointed
the judges?

03:36.400 --> 03:37.159
-They hate us.

03:37.199 --> 03:37.919
-It's rigged.

03:37.960 --> 03:39.639
-Everyone just calm down.

03:39.680 --> 03:40.520
-Zack, we're not 7.

03:40.560 --> 03:41.639
-Whoa, you might
be the winner.

03:41.680 --> 03:42.439
-What?

03:42.479 --> 03:43.199
-They're playing favorites.

03:43.240 --> 03:43.800
[interposing voices]

03:47.360 --> 03:48.759
-Enough!

03:48.800 --> 03:49.240
I agree you've been marked
harshly, but they're no excuse

03:49.280 --> 03:49.840
for whining.

03:49.879 --> 03:50.840
[phone vibrating]

03:50.879 --> 03:52.439
-Are we keeping you,
Miss Armstrong?

03:55.840 --> 03:58.039
I will be making inquiries
with the committee as to

03:58.080 --> 03:59.840
whether there is
bias involved.

03:59.879 --> 04:02.199
As the National school, we
enjoy certain privileges.

04:02.240 --> 04:03.719
It can work against us.

04:03.759 --> 04:05.599
However, that's not
your concern.

04:05.639 --> 04:08.639
You are going to suck it up and
focus on the contemporary

04:08.680 --> 04:11.360
round tomorrow.

04:11.400 --> 04:12.599
-Never.

04:18.600 --> 04:19.800
-There he is.

04:22.480 --> 04:23.800
-Hi.

04:23.839 --> 04:25.600
-Your mom's at a conference.

04:25.639 --> 04:27.480
We thought we could
be your fan base.

04:27.519 --> 04:28.759
-You guys just-- you weren't
at the theater

04:28.800 --> 04:29.759
just then, were you?

04:29.800 --> 04:31.600
-Sorry, I got stuck
at the hospital.

04:31.639 --> 04:33.639
-But you're on again
tomorrow, right?

04:33.680 --> 04:36.160
I saw you [inaudible].

04:36.199 --> 04:37.319
-6.9.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.160
Good one.

04:38.199 --> 04:40.160
-Yeah, Ollie, this is my dad.

04:40.199 --> 04:42.759
-Ah, the famous Dr. Lieberman.

04:42.800 --> 04:45.399
-So it didn't go
so well today?

04:45.439 --> 04:46.759
-I'm sure his girlfriend
rated him better.

04:46.800 --> 04:48.480
-Now, you.

04:48.519 --> 04:51.519
-I checked your relationship
status too.

04:51.560 --> 04:54.160
-Listen, why don't we do lunch
tomorrow before your

04:54.199 --> 04:55.120
performance.

04:55.160 --> 04:57.079
You can invite this
girl along.

04:57.120 --> 04:59.720
-Yeah, that sounds really--

04:59.759 --> 05:00.839
look, I've got to get
changed up, so--

05:03.639 --> 05:04.439
-I'll call you.

05:04.480 --> 05:05.040
-OK.

05:05.079 --> 05:06.079
-All right.

05:09.399 --> 05:13.040
-Lunch with family, and you
changed your status?

05:13.079 --> 05:14.800
This is getting serious.

05:14.839 --> 05:16.600
-Look, you cannot come to
theater tomorrow, because we

05:16.639 --> 05:19.199
might give off vibes.

05:19.240 --> 05:20.800
My family's not like
yours, OK?

05:20.839 --> 05:22.399
My mom would cry.

05:22.439 --> 05:23.879
Dad would just blame ballet.

05:23.920 --> 05:26.120
-Right, and his opinion counts
because he's always been so

05:26.160 --> 05:27.319
supportive.

05:43.800 --> 05:45.319
-Hello.

05:45.360 --> 05:46.319
-Hey.

05:46.360 --> 05:48.199
Thank you.

05:48.240 --> 05:51.160
Finn is done with the rewrites
but we are just, like, devoid

05:51.199 --> 05:53.360
of all choreography skills.

05:53.399 --> 05:55.160
-So are you going to
do both roles now?

05:55.199 --> 05:57.800
-Yeah, yours and mine.

05:57.839 --> 06:00.120
It's a Jekyll and Hyde
acting challenge.

06:00.160 --> 06:02.480
Finn, look who heard the
distress signal.

06:02.519 --> 06:03.480
-I told you.

06:03.519 --> 06:07.079
We don't need any help.

06:07.120 --> 06:09.319
-That is just a lie.

06:09.360 --> 06:10.800
-It's OK.

06:10.839 --> 06:12.240
He thinks I let you down.

06:12.279 --> 06:13.519
I got the voice mail.

06:16.879 --> 06:18.800
I couldn't have done it anyway,
now that it's opening

06:18.839 --> 06:19.959
tomorrow night.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.160
It's a direct clash with
the Nationals, so--

06:21.199 --> 06:22.680
-Yeah, I know darling.

06:22.720 --> 06:26.160
He gets it and so do I. Super
prestigious ballet competition

06:26.199 --> 06:31.560
trumps unpaid fringe
musical every time.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.759
-That Slade kid needs
to taking down.

06:33.800 --> 06:35.399
-The head man's got
you rattled.

06:35.439 --> 06:36.519
-It's you I'm worried about.

06:36.560 --> 06:38.160
Nothing is going to psych
me out tomorrow.

06:38.199 --> 06:39.480
That's why I'm beating you.

06:39.519 --> 06:43.319
-OK, so if I reminded you
that I beat you in the

06:43.360 --> 06:45.079
preliminaries, that wouldn't
be unsettling?

06:45.120 --> 06:48.199
-I was luring you into a false
sense of security.

06:48.240 --> 06:52.279
And that girl you like,
I'm with now.

06:52.319 --> 06:53.560
-Kat.

06:53.600 --> 06:55.480
She's so six months ago.

06:55.519 --> 06:58.160
And plus, [inaudible] actually
thinks I'm hot.

07:01.199 --> 07:02.319
-She was away sometimes.

07:04.639 --> 07:07.240
-Hey, Tara.

07:07.279 --> 07:09.120
Want to go to the beach?

07:09.160 --> 07:10.319
-Now?

07:22.480 --> 07:23.519
-Where've you been?

07:23.560 --> 07:24.319
-Just training.

07:24.360 --> 07:25.480
-Good.

07:25.519 --> 07:27.120
I wouldn't worry about
those judges.

07:27.160 --> 07:29.319
They'll be eating their score
cards when you win the

07:29.360 --> 07:30.800
International.

07:30.839 --> 07:32.199
Have you thought about
where you want your

07:32.240 --> 07:33.439
scholarship to be?

07:35.720 --> 07:38.680
-No, I um, didn't want
to jinx myself.

07:38.720 --> 07:40.560
-I've always thought--

07:40.600 --> 07:42.439
picture New York.

07:42.480 --> 07:44.560
We'll get an apartment
near Lincoln Center.

07:44.600 --> 07:46.639
You'll be in the company
by the time you're 18.

07:46.680 --> 07:48.319
-And soloist by 21.

07:48.360 --> 07:49.519
-Principal by the
time you're 24.

07:52.439 --> 07:53.800
It's all going to happen
for you, sweetheart.

07:56.600 --> 07:57.480
-Excuse me.

07:57.519 --> 07:58.800
Can I borrow you for a second?

07:58.839 --> 08:00.319
-Yes.

08:00.360 --> 08:03.160
Sorry, mom.

08:03.199 --> 08:08.199
-OK, all you got to do is shoot
me adoring looks and if

08:08.240 --> 08:11.519
I say something witty,
be like, oh, Sammy,

08:11.560 --> 08:13.720
you're such a character.

08:13.759 --> 08:17.399
-A sane person would just say,
no, Dad, I don't have a

08:17.439 --> 08:18.240
girlfriend.

08:18.279 --> 08:21.600
-Yes, but he's expecting one.

08:21.639 --> 08:23.800
-And if I can smooth just this
one situation, you know?

08:27.879 --> 08:30.199
-As my entire life has
become about pleasing

08:30.240 --> 08:32.360
other people, why not?

08:37.558 --> 08:39.279
-It's so sweet of
you to do this.

08:39.320 --> 08:42.320
It really puts stuff
in perspective.

08:42.360 --> 08:47.320
-Do you reckon you could eat
this raw, like sushi-style?

08:47.360 --> 08:50.519
-Perspective like, remember how
a couple weeks ago I said

08:50.559 --> 08:54.799
I wasn't ready to go
out with anyone?

08:54.840 --> 08:56.159
-Vaguely.

08:56.200 --> 09:00.200
-So if it makes a difference,
I think I'm past that.

09:03.799 --> 09:06.039
-Um, OK, look.

09:06.080 --> 09:09.799
Problem is, there's like
a friend ladder and

09:09.840 --> 09:11.480
a girlfriend ladder.

09:11.519 --> 09:15.279
And you can move Up and down
these ladders, but you just

09:15.320 --> 09:17.360
can't cross from one
ladder to another.

09:20.320 --> 09:21.639
-And I'm on the friend ladder.

09:21.679 --> 09:23.320
-Close to the top, but, yeah.

09:26.240 --> 09:27.399
-Got it.

09:32.480 --> 09:35.480
This was where we left
our stuff, right?

09:35.519 --> 09:36.720
-Have we been robbed?

09:41.159 --> 09:42.799
-Who steals from people in the
middle of an important

09:42.840 --> 09:44.159
competition?

09:47.159 --> 09:47.919
Slade.

09:47.960 --> 09:49.759
I would not put it past him.

09:53.440 --> 09:54.200
Somebody!

09:54.240 --> 09:55.840
Elite athletes in distress.

09:55.879 --> 09:56.840
-We can walk.

09:56.879 --> 09:58.279
Trust me, I've done it before.

10:15.879 --> 10:17.440
[squealing]

10:25.840 --> 10:27.159
-What?

10:27.200 --> 10:28.399
-Nothing.

10:30.600 --> 10:31.759
It's cool.

10:38.799 --> 10:42.679
-Heading into the final day of
the Nationals, to avoid any

10:42.720 --> 10:46.840
disputes about influence,
fictional or otherwise, the

10:46.879 --> 10:50.200
judging panel will keep
their scores private.

10:55.639 --> 10:58.200
Results will be announced at the
end of competition today.

11:01.840 --> 11:05.480
Benjamin Tickle, National
Academy.

11:05.519 --> 11:06.639
-Don't hurt yourself.

11:13.679 --> 11:18.360
-Hey, that must have been
some seaside adventure.

11:18.399 --> 11:19.840
-We're on the friends ladder.

11:19.879 --> 11:20.960
-Yeah, no.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.080
He didn't just look at
you like a friend.

11:35.679 --> 11:38.720
-Yeah, so just stick
to neutral topics.

11:38.759 --> 11:40.519
Like, the weather,
Sydney traffic.

11:43.480 --> 11:44.399
Look let's just abort.

11:44.440 --> 11:47.480
You obviously want
to be backstage.

11:47.519 --> 11:49.600
-Too late.

11:49.639 --> 11:50.200
-Sammy.

11:50.240 --> 11:51.159
-Dad, Ari.

11:51.200 --> 11:54.080
This is Abigail,
my girlfriend.

11:54.120 --> 11:54.799
My girlfriend Abigail.

11:54.840 --> 11:55.600
This is Dad.

11:55.639 --> 11:57.200
This is Ari, you've met.

11:57.240 --> 11:57.639
-Mr. Lieberman.

11:57.679 --> 11:58.559
-Abigail.

11:58.600 --> 12:01.240
-It's a lovely day.

12:01.279 --> 12:02.240
Was traffic OK?

12:02.279 --> 12:03.639
-Yeah, it was fine, thanks.

12:03.679 --> 12:05.120
Shall we eat?

12:05.159 --> 12:06.320
-Yeah.

12:14.799 --> 12:17.679
-Incredible, isn't he.

12:17.720 --> 12:21.600
-Should be asking why he's
suddenly all over you.

12:21.639 --> 12:25.279
-Because he's enchanted
by her winsome charms.

12:25.320 --> 12:27.200
-He's trying to psych me out.

12:27.240 --> 12:28.559
-Really?

12:28.600 --> 12:30.639
I'm so hideous that no one
would ever like me unless

12:30.679 --> 12:32.399
there's an agenda.

12:32.440 --> 12:35.480
-And why, pray tell, would it
psych you out, boyfriend?

12:35.519 --> 12:36.120
-That's the thing.

12:36.159 --> 12:38.200
It wouldn't.

12:38.240 --> 12:41.440
Just don't get hurt, OK?

12:41.480 --> 12:42.480
-Ignore him.

12:42.519 --> 12:44.720
The competition is warping
his brain.

12:51.360 --> 12:52.639
-Don't be nervous
on my account.

12:52.679 --> 12:54.159
I don't expect anything today.

12:54.200 --> 12:56.360
Just seeing how my
money is spent.

12:56.399 --> 12:57.840
-Just making sure you're
not wasting it.

13:01.399 --> 13:05.399
So how bad do you think I'm
going to be, exactly?

13:05.440 --> 13:06.799
-Honey, tone warning.

13:06.840 --> 13:09.639
-Sammy, I'm just trying
to make conversation.

13:09.679 --> 13:11.000
-Yeah.

13:11.039 --> 13:14.039
I mean, how would you know what
to say to me when we're

13:14.080 --> 13:15.279
basically strangers?

13:26.200 --> 13:27.200
-Sorry.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.360
He's just a little
temperamental.

13:29.399 --> 13:31.080
Excuse me.

13:31.120 --> 13:32.279
What are you doing?

13:34.519 --> 13:36.039
-Did you hear that?

13:36.080 --> 13:38.200
No matter how I do, I'm a
disappointment regardless.

13:41.200 --> 13:42.480
I can't do it, OK?

13:42.519 --> 13:44.399
I'm out.

13:44.440 --> 13:46.799
I can't get up there and try
and prove him wrong.

13:53.399 --> 13:55.440
You pushed me in the fountain!

13:55.480 --> 13:56.639
-You were irritating me.

13:58.879 --> 14:00.200
Can you just stop complaining
about your dad's low

14:00.240 --> 14:01.440
expectations?

14:01.480 --> 14:02.279
Do you have any idea what
I would give for low

14:02.320 --> 14:03.519
expectations?

14:03.559 --> 14:06.120
And who cares if he doesn't
think you're good?

14:06.159 --> 14:09.600
You're not dancing in that
competition because of him.

14:09.639 --> 14:11.759
-Right, OK, so why am
I dancing, then?

14:11.799 --> 14:13.120
Huh?

14:16.440 --> 14:18.159
-Because that's where
you want to be, more

14:18.200 --> 14:20.480
than anywhere else.

14:20.519 --> 14:22.159
You want to be on that stage,
doing what makes you happy.

14:57.840 --> 15:00.039
-I was going to sneak
out the back so we

15:00.080 --> 15:01.519
didn't give off vibes.

15:01.559 --> 15:06.080
-I could sort of use you
side stage, instead.

15:06.120 --> 15:07.399
I'm sorry.

15:07.440 --> 15:08.759
-All right.

15:08.799 --> 15:10.519
I'm just happy I'm so well
adjusted compared to you.

15:30.559 --> 15:33.159
-So I'm thinking.

15:33.200 --> 15:36.600
If anyone was to have the
skillage to cross ladders,

15:36.639 --> 15:40.360
it'd be you.

15:40.399 --> 15:42.240
-How would that work?

15:42.279 --> 15:45.159
-Well, um--

15:45.200 --> 15:48.200
the ladders, they would have
to be pretty close.

15:48.240 --> 15:51.639
And then if you just
leaned over--

15:51.679 --> 15:53.080
or I could--

15:56.240 --> 15:59.639
-Next to the stage, Christian
Reed, the National Academy.

16:03.879 --> 16:07.279
-Tell me you didn't just do that
to mess with Christian.

16:07.320 --> 16:07.600
-What?

16:07.639 --> 16:08.960
No.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.320
I mean, asking you to the beach
was-- it was a tactic

16:12.360 --> 16:14.200
But it didn't end like that.

16:14.240 --> 16:17.159
-Stop talking.

16:17.200 --> 16:19.559
This crush, or whatever it
was, is officially over.

16:32.679 --> 16:34.320
-I wonder if he's going
on with it.

16:42.679 --> 16:43.759
-Don't tell me there's
a boy lurking, when

16:43.799 --> 16:45.159
we're off to New York.

16:48.519 --> 16:50.639
-Break an eyelash,
Finn and Misty.

16:50.679 --> 16:53.440
-Who's that?

16:53.480 --> 16:56.039
Oh, this musical
theater people.

16:56.080 --> 16:57.240
How sweet.

16:59.480 --> 17:00.639
Right.

17:02.440 --> 17:04.358
-Mum?

17:04.400 --> 17:05.640
-Hmm?

17:05.680 --> 17:06.640
-I have to go.

17:06.680 --> 17:07.598
-Sit down please.

17:07.640 --> 17:08.799
We need to get your
makeup done.

17:08.839 --> 17:11.200
Come on.

17:11.240 --> 17:12.400
Right.

17:12.440 --> 17:14.720
Here we go.

17:14.759 --> 17:17.598
-Look, Mum.

17:17.640 --> 17:20.598
I know how much you want this.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.039
And you could be right.

17:22.079 --> 17:24.720
I might win the Prix.

17:24.759 --> 17:26.319
But I might not.

17:26.358 --> 17:28.200
Thing is, I don't
care either way?

17:28.240 --> 17:32.039
-Sweetheart, it's just
the nerves talking.

17:32.079 --> 17:32.640
Just relax.

17:32.680 --> 17:34.200
-No, Mum, listen.

17:34.240 --> 17:35.799
I'm not dancing today.

17:40.680 --> 17:43.799
-I can't breathe.

17:43.839 --> 17:44.799
-Right.

17:44.839 --> 17:46.119
-I can't breathe.

17:46.160 --> 17:51.359
-Mum, I can't be responsible
for making you breathe.

17:51.400 --> 17:53.440
That's not my job.

17:53.480 --> 17:54.640
-Sweetheart.

18:25.240 --> 18:27.200
-Once again, the Slade
is superior.

18:27.240 --> 18:28.720
-Not with that headband.

18:28.759 --> 18:30.799
-Samuel Lieberman,

We didn't get to finish
our lunch.

21:28.359 --> 21:29.720
Do you think you could
come home soon?

21:32.359 --> 21:33.640
You, too, Ollie.

You're welcome any time.

NARRATOR: There's this argument
that there shouldn't

21:46.119 --> 21:48.200
be competitions in ballet.

21:48.240 --> 21:51.759
Because it's an art,
not a sport.

-The following four dancers will
be representing Australia

21:57.200 --> 22:02.519
in the international round
of the Prix de Fonteyn.

22:02.559 --> 22:04.440
-But competition brings out
the best in some people.

22:08.519 --> 22:11.359
For others it crystallizes
what's important to them.

saying that right now, to
