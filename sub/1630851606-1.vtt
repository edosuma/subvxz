-Relax, man.

28:07.477 --> 28:09.813
'Cause if she's not okay,
we're gonna have a big problem.

28:10.605 --> 28:11.648
[Cleo] Come on, man.

28:12.649 --> 28:15.568
They say you killed a cop. That true?

28:16.945 --> 28:17.904
No.

28:19.280 --> 28:20.240
That's too bad.

28:20.323 --> 28:24.285
They told me you were a killer.
I was about to be afraid.

28:26.579 --> 28:28.039
Copper probably deserved it.

28:30.792 --> 28:32.127
No. She didn't.

28:42.721 --> 28:43.930
[Cleo] Boss, he's here.

28:45.140 --> 28:46.725
Hey, found your boyfriend.

28:48.643 --> 28:50.228
Hey. Listen.

28:50.311 --> 28:51.396
-I just--
-Liar!

28:53.565 --> 28:55.525
[John B gasping]

28:55.608 --> 28:59.028
I wouldn't provoke him.
It tends not to go so well.

29:00.029 --> 29:03.950
-You can run, but you can't hide, John B.
-[gasps, coughing]

29:04.033 --> 29:06.661
[captain] I got eyes and ears everywhere.

29:08.371 --> 29:09.748
[grunts]

29:10.874 --> 29:13.293
-Took you long enough.
-Next time, get him yourself.

29:13.376 --> 29:17.380
[captain] After all our hospitality,
you left without saying goodbye.

29:18.214 --> 29:19.215
Let us go.

29:19.716 --> 29:22.260
I got 50,000 reasons
why that ain't gonna happen.

29:22.343 --> 29:23.428
He didn't do anything.

29:23.511 --> 29:26.014
Maybe he did.
Maybe he didn't. I don't care.

29:26.097 --> 29:27.974
-We let the courts decide.
-[laughs]

29:28.057 --> 29:29.559
Bring him to the proper authorities.

29:29.642 --> 29:34.147
What are you talking about? Hey, no, no.
Listen, listen. I can pay. I can pay you.

29:34.230 --> 29:37.901
You got 50K in your back pocket?
If not, bye-bye.

29:37.984 --> 29:39.986
[dramatic music playing]

29:45.575 --> 29:46.409
Easy, girlie.

29:49.078 --> 29:50.246
Slowly.

30:04.636 --> 30:06.304
-What is that?
-What's it look like?

30:06.387 --> 30:07.639
Give it to me.

30:07.722 --> 30:09.098
[Stubbs] Give it to him!

30:14.896 --> 30:18.107
One hundred and forty-three thousand
reasons to let us go.

30:20.026 --> 30:21.444
More than the bounty.

30:25.698 --> 30:28.117
I'll tell you what.
That is your rescue fee.

30:28.201 --> 30:30.286
-But I want my bounty too.
-No, no, no, no!

30:30.370 --> 30:33.039
-No! Terrance! Terrance! Terrance!
-[Sarah] No. That wasn't the deal!

30:33.122 --> 30:36.459
[John B] Just one!
That's just one! Hey! There's more!

30:38.795 --> 30:40.755
Look, I went to Paradise Island,

30:41.422 --> 30:42.757
to her family's house.

30:45.635 --> 30:50.014
There is hundreds of millions
of dollars' worth of that gold there.

30:50.098 --> 30:54.185
It is an empty, undefended house.
She has the entry codes.

30:54.269 --> 30:57.146
-Girlie, is this true?
-It's my family's house. [sniffles]

30:57.730 --> 30:58.731
The gold's there.

31:00.441 --> 31:01.860
And I can get you to it.

31:04.445 --> 31:07.740
-[JJ] I never doubted them.
-[laughs] I owe you five bucks.

31:07.824 --> 31:12.203
-Kiara, I need those setups done by five!
-There are other people that work here.

31:12.287 --> 31:13.538
[Anna] None of 'em my children.

31:13.621 --> 31:16.249
[Pope] I feel that. On a deep,
emotional level, I understand that.

31:16.332 --> 31:18.042
[JJ] So we going to the Bahamas or what?

31:18.126 --> 31:19.794
There's no way
we're getting to the Bahamas.

31:19.878 --> 31:21.379
John B will get nabbed sooner or later.

31:21.462 --> 31:24.215
So if we're gonna clear his name,
we need to have done it yesterday.

31:25.133 --> 31:27.760
-[JJ] I'll tell you how we do it.
-So you have it all planned out?

31:28.678 --> 31:30.096
[JJ] As a matter of fact, I do.

31:30.179 --> 31:32.098
-We kidnap Rafe.
-[Pope] I'm sorry, what?

31:32.181 --> 31:35.059
We kidnap Rafe, tie him up
and stick the gun in his mouth

31:35.143 --> 31:36.644
and just wait till he starts squawking.

31:36.728 --> 31:37.979
You know, torture's a war crime.

31:38.062 --> 31:41.274
Yeah, so how exactly
do you plan on clearing John B's name

31:41.357 --> 31:43.693
from a prison cell?
Because that's a felony.

31:43.776 --> 31:45.361
All right, well, what do you got, Pope?

31:45.486 --> 31:48.615
I was just trying to keep it simple.
You know, one stop, and we're done.

31:48.698 --> 31:50.241
Guys, all we need is a material witness.

31:50.325 --> 31:52.493
We saw Ward's plane fly
right over our heads

31:52.577 --> 31:54.037
with the gold inside of it.

31:54.120 --> 31:57.040
He didn't fly it. If somebody else flew,
they were there on the tarmac.

31:57.123 --> 31:58.791
They saw Peterkin get murdered.

31:59.626 --> 32:03.004
We just have to find whoever that was
and get them to confess on record.

32:03.087 --> 32:04.172
How do we do that?

32:05.298 --> 32:06.883
A little light espionage.

32:06.966 --> 32:08.384
A little ghost recon.

32:09.594 --> 32:11.804
-Woogity-woogity.
-Woogity, baby.

32:13.139 --> 32:16.059
[Pope] If this guy flew planes for Ward,
he's gotta be pretty tight-lipped.

32:16.142 --> 32:17.936
So then direct approach gets my vote.

32:18.019 --> 32:19.771
-JJ, no.
-No. What?

32:19.854 --> 32:20.980
-Put the gun down, man.
-Guys!

32:21.064 --> 32:23.232
We gotta keep this simple,
or we'll never get John B off.

32:23.316 --> 32:25.735
Or we just tickle the wire.

32:25.818 --> 32:27.820
-What?
-We tickle the wire.

32:28.529 --> 32:31.282
I plant my phone in his car,

32:32.241 --> 32:34.202
and then we listen in on your AirPods.

32:34.827 --> 32:36.579
-Say something.
-Something.

32:36.663 --> 32:39.582
-[Kiara on recording] Something.
-Okay, we have audio.

32:40.583 --> 32:42.418
I think that's his house over there.

32:42.961 --> 32:43.836
All right, honk

32:43.920 --> 32:47.465
or, uh… or yell or something
if you see anything suspicious.

32:47.548 --> 32:49.050
Don't do anything dangerous.

32:49.133 --> 32:50.134
Come on. I'm not JJ.

32:50.927 --> 32:53.930
Funny, Pope. Love third-wheeling.
It's my favorite thing.

32:54.013 --> 32:56.015
[suspenseful music playing]

32:59.435 --> 33:02.105
How's it been going,
you know, with Pope and all?

33:02.814 --> 33:04.315
-It's good.
-It's good? All right.

33:09.654 --> 33:12.573
In the bedroom, is he, like,
kinda freaky, 'cause it's Pope, you know?

33:12.657 --> 33:13.658
Why are you asking?

33:13.741 --> 33:15.743
I don't know. Just kinda curious.

33:15.827 --> 33:17.537
Just spitballing here.

33:18.705 --> 33:20.206
You don't need to spitball.

33:20.999 --> 33:22.542
We could sit in silence.

33:37.515 --> 33:39.017
[crowd cheering on TV]

34:01.414 --> 34:02.957
-Ranking-wise--
-Oh, you're still asking?

34:03.041 --> 34:04.917
-Yeah, I was just curious.
-You're still curious.

34:05.001 --> 34:06.461
[splutters] Is John B better?

34:06.544 --> 34:07.378
-What?
-Okay.

34:10.673 --> 34:14.010
Okay. Phase one is complete.

34:17.555 --> 34:19.265
Everything-- Are we all good?

34:19.348 --> 34:21.225
[dramatic music playing]

34:22.185 --> 34:26.898
[Terrance] Home sweet home.
Take us to your mansion, Miss Fancy-pants.

34:28.066 --> 34:29.525
All right, this is it.

34:34.906 --> 34:35.740
You lied.

34:38.451 --> 34:42.080
I am very aware of that,
and I am very sorry.

34:42.163 --> 34:43.956
And I shouldn't have gone.

34:44.040 --> 34:45.500
Is the gold even there?

34:46.375 --> 34:48.377
Uh… I think so.

34:48.461 --> 34:50.296
-You think?
-[man] Okay. Hold on.

34:52.924 --> 34:54.342
-Hey there.
-[man] Yes. Yes.

34:54.425 --> 34:56.803
-[John B] How are you?
-I'll call Miss Finley about her dog.

34:56.886 --> 34:58.596
-[John B] Miss Finley's dog.
-One second.

34:58.679 --> 35:02.683
I'm actually just coming
to pick up my leaf blower from, um…

35:02.767 --> 35:04.393
-[whispers] Bay Line.
-Bay Line.

35:04.894 --> 35:06.312
I do a lot of work over there.

35:06.395 --> 35:08.314
-[man] Yep. Go ahead.
-Thank you.

35:08.397 --> 35:10.233
-[man] I'm listening.
-Have a good--

35:10.316 --> 35:11.901
[man] I hear you. Yes, I hear you,

35:11.984 --> 35:14.529
and we're gonna address
that in due course.

35:15.571 --> 35:17.073
No, no, no, no.

35:17.657 --> 35:19.867
-[JJ] Why does she get to tickle?
-[Pope] She's the best.

35:19.951 --> 35:22.829
-[Kie] Should I do an accent?
-[Pope] Definitely disguise your voice.

35:22.912 --> 35:24.997
[in English accent]
How would you like me to talk?

35:25.081 --> 35:26.457
-Not like that.
-[Pope] No.

35:26.541 --> 35:28.084
-Batman.
-[in deep voice] Batman.

35:28.167 --> 35:29.752
-There you go.
-[JJ] Spot-on. Let's do it.

35:29.836 --> 35:33.214
-[vibrating, ringing]
-[announcer speaking indistinctly on TV]

35:36.634 --> 35:38.052
-Hello?
-[in deep voice] Hello.

35:38.136 --> 35:39.220
-I can't.
-Just talk.

35:39.303 --> 35:42.473
-[Gavin] Hello?
-[clears throat] Is Gavin there?

35:42.557 --> 35:46.227
-This is Gavin. Who's this? Hello?
-I know what happened on the tarmac.

35:46.310 --> 35:49.147
[laughs] Um… who's this?

35:49.230 --> 35:50.690
It was Rafe Cameron.

35:51.274 --> 35:53.693
But you already knew that,
and you lied about it.

35:53.776 --> 35:55.611
-Okay. Who is this?
-[Kie] We're gonna prove it.

35:55.695 --> 35:57.488
[Gavin] You're gonna tell me
who this is now.

35:57.572 --> 35:59.824
You could have saved her, Gavin,
and you didn't.

35:59.907 --> 36:01.909
And you're not getting away with this.

36:01.993 --> 36:03.035
Listen to me!

36:03.119 --> 36:04.036
Who is this?

36:04.537 --> 36:05.580
-How was that?
-Yeah.

36:06.247 --> 36:07.498
Yeah, I was scared. Good job.

36:07.582 --> 36:09.792
All right. We tickled the wire.
Phase two complete.

36:09.876 --> 36:11.377
-Now we wait and listen.
-Okay.

36:13.838 --> 36:15.339
Is everything all right?

36:15.423 --> 36:16.257
No.

36:17.884 --> 36:18.759
I'll be back.

36:18.843 --> 36:21.220
[dramatic music playing]

36:21.304 --> 36:23.806
[Pope] All right.
Hey, here he comes. Stay down.

36:28.644 --> 36:29.770
[JJ] He didn't see us.

36:29.854 --> 36:32.398
-Hit it.
-[Pope] Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

36:32.481 --> 36:33.357
My seat belt.

36:33.441 --> 36:35.693
-[JJ] Are you seriously buckling up now?
-[Pope] Yes, I am.

36:35.776 --> 36:37.653
[Kie] You don't need it right now.

36:41.699 --> 36:42.617
[sighs]

36:43.117 --> 36:44.202
Call Ward Cameron.

36:44.285 --> 36:46.162
[dings, ringing]

36:46.245 --> 36:47.955
-[Ward] Hello?
-He's talking to Ward.

36:48.039 --> 36:49.207
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

36:49.290 --> 36:50.249
Can you talk?

36:50.333 --> 36:51.751
[distorted voice talking]

36:51.834 --> 36:53.961
-Get clo… get closer. I can't hear.
-Okay.

36:54.045 --> 36:56.005
What are you talking about,
"renegotiate," Gavin?

36:56.088 --> 36:58.174
I need to be paid more, all right?

36:58.257 --> 36:59.926
He's talking about negotiating something.

37:00.009 --> 37:00.927
Re… renegotiating.

37:01.010 --> 37:04.263
You need to stop and think very carefully
about what you're about to say here, okay,

37:04.347 --> 37:06.182
because I have treated you very well.

37:06.265 --> 37:08.559
And I can't figure out
why I should give you one more penny.

37:08.643 --> 37:11.979
I've got something
that could put you away for life, okay?

37:13.105 --> 37:14.315
What are you talking about?

37:14.398 --> 37:17.068
I've got the gun, Ward,
that your son used. I have it.

37:17.151 --> 37:18.653
I know you told me to toss it.

37:18.736 --> 37:21.072
I know how you work. I kept it.

37:21.155 --> 37:23.199
Gavin's got the gun
that Rafe used to kill Peterkin.

37:23.282 --> 37:25.201
[Gavin] Somebody called me, okay? People…

37:25.284 --> 37:26.702
-Holy shit.
-Oh, shit.

37:26.786 --> 37:28.913
People are onto me.
Somebody knows what's going on.

37:28.996 --> 37:31.290
I think he's trying to use it
as extortion, as leverage.

37:31.374 --> 37:34.293
Nobody is onto you.
There's nobody that knows anything.

37:34.377 --> 37:37.004
Somebody is just screwing around with you.
You just gotta calm down.

37:37.088 --> 37:39.882
I want triple, and I want the plane.

37:40.758 --> 37:42.260
-I can't do that.
-[Gavin] I don't care.

37:42.343 --> 37:44.011
You have to figure it out.
I've got the gun.

37:44.095 --> 37:46.472
-Wait. He's pulling over.
-[Pope] Shit. He's panicking.

37:46.973 --> 37:49.517
-Do I pull behind him? What do I do?
-Go around the block.

37:49.600 --> 37:50.601
Yeah. Yeah, just go.

37:50.685 --> 37:53.104
[Gavin] I want the money now.
You need to meet me tonight.

37:53.187 --> 37:54.146
We're gonna lose him.

37:54.230 --> 37:56.023
-[JJ] Go, go, go!
-I'm going. I'm going.

37:56.107 --> 37:59.610
[Pope] I can't hear anything. Shit.
I'm losing the signal. I can't hear him.

37:59.694 --> 38:00.820
[JJ] What the hell is this?

38:00.903 --> 38:04.156
-Stop. Just stop and turn around now.
-[JJ] Pull in here and back up.

38:04.240 --> 38:05.533
[Kie] I'm just gonna back up.

38:05.616 --> 38:07.660
-[JJ] What are you doing?
-[Kie] Are you kidding?

38:07.743 --> 38:09.453
[truck beeping]

38:09.537 --> 38:12.206
-[JJ] Hey! We were about to back up.
-[Kie] What are you doing?

38:12.290 --> 38:14.250
[JJ] You literally had
to do that now? Wait! Pope!

38:14.333 --> 38:16.043
[Pope] We gotta know
where they're meeting.

38:16.127 --> 38:17.628
-We're going after him, right?
-Yep.

38:17.712 --> 38:18.921
-Okay.
-Go.

38:19.005 --> 38:20.798
-[man] You can't leave that car there.
-Sorry.

38:20.881 --> 38:22.341
-[man] Move it.
-[JJ] Get it later.

38:22.425 --> 38:24.385
[suspenseful music playing]

38:26.178 --> 38:27.763
-[JJ] Pope!
-[Kie] Go! Go!

38:27.847 --> 38:29.265
-Go!
-[JJ] Pope!

38:31.684 --> 38:34.103
-Pope!
-[girls laughing]

38:36.314 --> 38:37.189
Yo, Pope.

38:37.273 --> 38:38.983
-Hey.
-Hey.

38:40.276 --> 38:41.152
[grunts]

38:42.486 --> 38:45.656
No, no, no, no, no. [panting]

38:46.657 --> 38:48.200
[Ward on headphones] Gavin, meet me now

38:48.284 --> 38:51.662
at the construction site
near that surf shop. You understand?

38:51.746 --> 38:53.873
Sean? Ah, this is
where you live, you Kook.

38:53.956 --> 38:55.124
Goddamn.

38:55.207 --> 38:58.127
[Ward] You bring the gun,
I will bring you your money.

38:58.210 --> 39:00.713
And then we're done. Are we good?

39:00.796 --> 39:04.091
Yes, okay.
All right, I'll, um… I'll see you there.

39:13.100 --> 39:15.102
-[Kie] What does that mean?
-Did you hear something?

39:15.186 --> 39:17.897
He… he's meeting Ward right now.
We gotta go.

39:17.980 --> 39:19.357
-Come on.
-[Kie] Okay, come on.

39:22.360 --> 39:23.861
[Sarah] Let's make this fast.

39:28.532 --> 39:31.702
Gotta be pretty rich
to have a waterfall in your front yard.

39:32.536 --> 39:34.955
You're full of surprises,
ain't you, Miss Rich?

39:39.418 --> 39:43.047
I absolutely love
what you've done with the landscaping.

39:43.130 --> 39:45.841
-[suspenseful music playing]
-[door unlocking]

39:46.425 --> 39:47.343
[Sarah sighs]

39:49.053 --> 39:50.888
Get in. We don't have all night. Go.

39:56.644 --> 40:00.064
-[Rose] Is this enough?
-It has to be. It's all I can get tonight.

40:00.147 --> 40:02.108
Okay, well,
what if he doesn't give you the gun?

40:02.191 --> 40:03.526
No gun, no money.

40:04.318 --> 40:06.612
I'll button this up tonight.
I gotta pay this asshole,

40:06.695 --> 40:09.865
and in two days,
I meet the Swiss in Nassau.

40:11.784 --> 40:15.371
Once they take possession, we're golden.

40:15.454 --> 40:16.330
[Rose] Yeah?

40:16.831 --> 40:17.873
Yeah. Give me that.

40:19.166 --> 40:22.753
All I'm saying, Ward,
if something were to go sideways,

40:22.837 --> 40:25.381
we could always tell the truth about Rafe.

40:30.177 --> 40:31.929
Don't ever say that again, Rose.

40:33.264 --> 40:34.140
Never.

40:34.849 --> 40:37.184
[cell phone beeping]

40:43.774 --> 40:45.276
What? What is it?

40:45.359 --> 40:46.735
Paradise Island.

40:46.819 --> 40:49.155
-Paradise Island?
-Front door security alert.

[dramatic music playing]

40:56.871 --> 40:57.872
That's weird.

40:59.832 --> 41:01.375
Somebody's on the property.

41:01.959 --> 41:04.378
[Sarah sighs] Okay, let's see here.

41:04.462 --> 41:05.546
Showtime, girlie.

-[buttons beeping]
-Um…

41:07.089 --> 41:08.799
[Terrance] You best remember that combo.

41:08.883 --> 41:09.717
[door jams]

41:10.342 --> 41:12.219
I knew
I should have never listened to you.

41:12.303 --> 41:14.013
Usually, he uses his birthday.

41:14.847 --> 41:17.308
-Maybe I entered it wrong.
-[door jams]

41:17.391 --> 41:19.643
-[Terrance] Chop-chop. Let's go.
-I'm trying.

41:20.394 --> 41:22.062
-[John B] What about Rose?
-Rose's.

41:22.146 --> 41:24.190
[buttons beeping]

41:26.484 --> 41:30.237
I tell you what, you don't get it open,
I get my 50K consolation, all right?

41:30.321 --> 41:32.031
[John B] Just give her
a second, all right?

41:32.114 --> 41:34.283
[buttons beeping]

41:36.744 --> 41:37.912
Your birthday?

41:38.704 --> 41:40.498
-Try it.
-Okay.

41:40.581 --> 41:42.958

Bingo. Nice job, girlie.

41:55.179 --> 41:56.055
[Cleo] Wow.

41:58.474 --> 41:59.475
I'll be damned.

42:00.226 --> 42:01.393
I need shades.

42:01.477 --> 42:04.396
Go get the bags, Stubbs.
Go get the goddamn duffel bags!

42:04.480 --> 42:05.689
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

42:10.152 --> 42:13.155
[suspenseful music playing]

-[guard 1] There's someone inside.
-[guard 2] Approaching premises now.

42:20.579 --> 42:23.040
Let's get outta here.
Should've never let you talk me into this.

-Rent-a-cops, incoming.
-[banging on door]

42:25.960 --> 42:27.086

-Yeah, go, go, go, go. We'll come back.
-Okay.

42:30.756 --> 42:32.550
-No!
-Terrance, what are you doing?

42:32.633 --> 42:36.470
You're the bait
that's gonna slow 'em down. See you later.

42:36.554 --> 42:38.305
-No! Terrance! Open the door!
-Terrance!

42:38.389 --> 42:40.266

-[Sarah] What do we do?
-[shushes]

42:45.271 --> 42:47.731
[guard 2] Search the whole place.
They're in there somewhere.

42:47.815 --> 42:50.776
-[indistinct chattering on radio]
-Split up and look around.

42:50.859 --> 42:53.320
-I'll go upstairs and distract them.
-No, no. You'll get caught.

42:53.404 --> 42:55.948
-What else do we have?
-[guard 2] Have anything?

42:56.031 --> 42:56.949
Shit.

42:57.533 --> 42:59.702
Okay. If you do that,

43:00.703 --> 43:03.622
we have a boat here,
in the cove behind the property.

43:03.706 --> 43:04.623
I'll get the keys.

43:04.707 --> 43:07.084
-Meet me there as soon as you can, okay?

43:31.025 --> 43:32.151
-Come on.

43:32.234 --> 43:34.987
Come on. Come on.
I know they don't pay you enough

43:35.070 --> 43:36.196
for this type of shit.

43:36.280 --> 43:37.489
[guard 2] Get back here!

43:39.158 --> 43:40.993
[guard 1] I still don't see nothing.

What does he look like?

46:26.867 --> 46:31.038
He's Caucasian, male. Maybe 17, 18.

46:31.872 --> 46:33.791
Let me see his face.
Put the camera on his face.
