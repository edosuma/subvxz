00:02.001 --> 00:05.403
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>
<i>who lost everything...</i>

00:05.505 --> 00:07.496
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice...</i>

00:07.607 --> 00:09.598
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

00:15.148 --> 00:16.843
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

00:19.019 --> 00:21.510
<i>George Michael</i>
<i>was getting ready for school...</i>

00:21.621 --> 00:24.681
<i>when he came across a box</i>
<i>oflove letters he'd written...</i>

00:24.791 --> 00:28.352
<i>but never sent</i>
<i>to his cousin Maeby.</i>

00:28.461 --> 00:31.191
<i>One letter titled "If You Weren't My Cousin,"</i>

00:31.297 --> 00:33.197
<i>was particularly incriminating.</i>

00:33.299 --> 00:35.267
Hey, pal, you want a ride to school?

00:35.368 --> 00:37.768
Um, no. Actually, I'm-

00:37.871 --> 00:40.032
I'm riding with the Veals, Ann's parents.

00:40.140 --> 00:43.667
You don't need to be penned up with them.
I'll drive you both. We'll take the stairs.

00:43.777 --> 00:46.473
<i>Right. Here's the thing though.</i>
<i>It's kind of cramped in there.</i>

00:46.579 --> 00:49.946
<i>Plus, a lot ofkids are still talking about when</i>
<i>you took down that homecoming banner.</i>

00:51.651 --> 00:54.119
Listen, are you embarrassed
to be seen in that car?

00:54.220 --> 00:56.381
It's not a car. But- But, no.

00:58.324 --> 01:00.918
I've got to get a new car.

01:01.027 --> 01:03.928
<i>George Michael decided</i>
<i>to hide the love letters in the attic...</i>

01:04.030 --> 01:05.930
<i>although Maeby</i>
<i>had her own problems.</i>

01:06.032 --> 01:07.932
<i>After lying about her age...</i>

01:08.034 --> 01:11.868
<i>she had conned her way into a job</i>
<i>as a movie studio executive.</i>

01:11.971 --> 01:15.236
Did you get the stack of scripts that I sent you?
'Cause you certainly look well-rested.

01:15.341 --> 01:18.401
- Marry me.
- Ha! I need your notes on those tomorrow.

01:18.511 --> 01:21.139
- Wanna have a drink?
- Yeah. Why don't we ask your wife
to come with us?

01:21.247 --> 01:23.408
Okay, then.
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:23.516 --> 01:26.280
<i>And downstairs, Buster paid a visit.</i>

01:26.386 --> 01:29.651
- Hey, Brother. I need a favor.
- Of course you do.

01:29.756 --> 01:32.247
I'm on furlough this week, and
everybody's out dancing with their girl...

01:32.358 --> 01:35.259
- and I'm home sitting with Mom.
- Mom doesn't wanna go dancing?

01:35.361 --> 01:38.262
I think the age difference
is really starting to catch up to us.

01:38.364 --> 01:40.924
Maybe it's time you got out there
and started meeting people, you know?

01:41.034 --> 01:44.333
Meetin' women. Meetin' women
who didn't give birth to you.

01:44.437 --> 01:48.931
- Maybe you could go with me.
- Not really what I meant-
I have a very busy schedule now.

01:49.042 --> 01:53.706
<i>My schedule, however, is as open</i>
<i>as my relationship with my wife.</i>

01:53.813 --> 01:56.475
So why don't we pair up?

01:56.583 --> 01:58.448
<i>And-And hit the town together.</i>

01:58.551 --> 02:00.542
- Oh.
- I'll be your wingman.

02:00.653 --> 02:04.953
Even if it means
me taking a chubby, I will suck it up.

02:05.058 --> 02:07.253
Boy, that's enough
family stuff for today.

02:07.360 --> 02:10.386
<i>That's right, Michael.</i>
<i>Guess whojust got fired.</i>

02:10.497 --> 02:13.728
<i>Gob was recently hired</i>
<i>by the Bluth Company's rival...</i>

02:13.833 --> 02:15.733
<i>Sitwell Enterprises.</i>

02:15.835 --> 02:19.828
- <i>Although he started off well</i>-
- Fifty-two percent of the country is single.

02:19.939 --> 02:22.635
That's a market that's been
dominated by apartment rentals.

02:22.742 --> 02:27.406
<i>Let's take some of that market.</i>
<i>I call it Single City.</i>

02:27.514 --> 02:29.641
<i>His ideas failed to evolve.</i>

02:29.749 --> 02:32.650
It's like, "Hey, you wanna
go down to the whirlpool?"

02:32.752 --> 02:35.312
"Yeah. I don't have a husband."
I call it Swing City.

02:35.421 --> 02:38.083
Let's get into some new
areas, if you don't mind.

02:38.191 --> 02:41.490
<i>But Gob continued</i>
<i>to fine-tune his first one.</i>

02:41.594 --> 02:43.494
How do we filter out the teases?

02:43.596 --> 02:45.587
We don't let them in.

02:45.698 --> 02:47.598
This goes for the guys too...

02:47.700 --> 02:49.725
because sometimes the guys
are tapped out.

02:49.836 --> 02:54.432
But check your lease, man,
because you're livin' in- City.

02:54.541 --> 02:56.509
- You're fired.
- <i>So get this.</i>

02:56.609 --> 02:58.304
I took his dress eyebrows.

02:58.411 --> 03:01.676
<i>Sitwell suffered from a disease</i>
<i>that rendered him completely hairless.</i>

03:01.781 --> 03:04.011
He's not gonna be happy about that.

03:04.117 --> 03:07.052
No, especially when he goes to the opera
with two mustaches on his forehead.

03:07.153 --> 03:10.179
Oh, but the good news is:
I'm coming back to the Bluth Company.

03:10.290 --> 03:13.851
Gob, we're gettin' all jammed up here, okay?

03:13.960 --> 03:16.554
The only reason that you were president
was to appease the board.

03:16.663 --> 03:18.563
They've been appeased.
I got the job.

03:18.665 --> 03:22.931
No, I don't need to be president.
I just liked having an office, a title.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.799
- Sure.
- Paycheck.

03:24.904 --> 03:28.362
Also I need a company car.
You do have to match Sitwell there.

03:28.474 --> 03:30.237
Hang on. He gave you
a company car?

03:30.343 --> 03:33.039
Yeah. And it was way better than any
of the company cars Dad ever gave me.

03:33.146 --> 03:35.614
- Yeah, right.
- I mean, the Camaro was okay.

03:37.483 --> 03:40.213
Are you serious?
Dad gave you the Camaro?

03:40.320 --> 03:43.255
I thought you won that
on <i>Card Sharks.</i>

03:43.356 --> 03:47.952
Michael, I was never on <i>Card Sharks.</i>
Dad told us not to tell you.

03:48.061 --> 03:50.495
<i>Michael decided to confront his father...</i>

03:50.597 --> 03:53.589
<i>who'd been living in the attic</i>
<i>since he'd escaped from prison.</i>

03:53.700 --> 03:56.260
- Dad?
- Oh, thank God you're here.

03:56.369 --> 03:58.837
I'm going crazy
with the boredom, Michael.

03:58.938 --> 04:01.998
At least in prison, we had knife fights,
and we had movie night.

04:02.108 --> 04:06.772
And once both. Those men did not enjoy <i>Soapdish.</i>
I think you have to know that world.

04:06.879 --> 04:10.815
Yeah, listen, did you buy a company car
for everyone in the family except me?

04:10.917 --> 04:13.078
Well, according to the books,
I gave you four.

04:13.186 --> 04:15.848
I'm serious. I'm driving
a staircase, for God's sake.

04:15.955 --> 04:17.946
It smells like gas.
I get hop-ons.

04:18.057 --> 04:20.992
- Well, of course you're gonna get hop-ons.
- I pull down banners, all right?

04:21.094 --> 04:24.291
And most importantly, Dad,
my son does not like to be seen in it.

04:24.397 --> 04:26.627
But he likes being seen with that girl.

04:26.733 --> 04:29.099
- It makes no sense, I know.
- It doesn't.

04:29.202 --> 04:31.602
I never gave you a-a company car.

04:31.704 --> 04:34.138
No, I gave you something
far more important.

04:34.240 --> 04:36.970
I gave you company, which, apparently,
you don't want to give to me.

04:37.076 --> 04:40.239
- You're not listening to me.
I'd love to sit and chat, but...
- I'm lonely up here.

04:40.346 --> 04:43.247
I've got to get an early start.
I'm expecting headwinds on the stair car.

04:43.349 --> 04:47.217
You see anybody here? You could bring me
a book. Pop-Pop gets a Grisham?

04:47.320 --> 04:50.380
So you take your mom to work
every day? Bummer.

04:50.490 --> 04:54.017
Moms are such a pain in the ass, huh?
It's like "Die already!"

04:54.127 --> 04:56.493
- I love my mother.
- Huh?

04:56.596 --> 04:59.292
She's one of the two most
important people in my life.

04:59.399 --> 05:01.299
You know, she and Quincy.

05:01.401 --> 05:04.632
<i>A spokesman</i>
<i>for Mr. Jones denies they've ever met...</i>

05:04.737 --> 05:09.697
<i>although he could not explain the six</i>
<i>signed gold records in Starla's apartment.</i>

05:09.809 --> 05:12.835
I could never be with a man
who doesn't love his mother.

05:12.945 --> 05:14.810
- Oh.
- Wow.

05:14.914 --> 05:18.680
So, Michael, listen. I'm here
to convince you to hire me back.

05:18.785 --> 05:22.380
I'm an ideas man, Michael. I think
I proved that with- Mountain.

05:22.488 --> 05:24.388
Listen, I want this, Michael.

05:24.490 --> 05:26.685
I'm gonna prove to you that
I'm worthy of rehiring...

05:26.793 --> 05:29.762
if it takes every ounce of
determination that I've got.

05:31.264 --> 05:33.164
Where are you going?

05:33.266 --> 05:35.826
Did you want me
to stay and do that?

05:39.005 --> 05:42.168
- Barry.
- Good news and even better news.

05:42.275 --> 05:44.175
Your company's stock is unfrozen...

05:44.277 --> 05:46.177
and my lawsuit against
the L.A. Kings is moving forward.

05:46.279 --> 05:49.180
- How did that happen?
- Maybe a puck hit me. It could happen.

05:49.282 --> 05:54.276
No, the stock. Now, that means we can sell,
right? We can do whatever we want with it?

05:54.387 --> 05:57.356
I'll tell you one thing you don't want to do
is buy stock in the L.A. Kings.

05:57.457 --> 05:59.584
Do you think I could sell
enough to buy a car?

05:59.692 --> 06:02.559
I thought you had four.
Oh, you mean a real one. Yeah, sure.

06:02.662 --> 06:05.392
You can get one, as long as everyone
doesn't sell the company stock at once.

06:05.498 --> 06:08.365
<i>You don't want someone else</i>
<i>to get control of the company.</i>

06:08.468 --> 06:12.029
Right. Gotta keep the company intact, right?
The other people shouldn't risk selling their-

06:12.138 --> 06:14.971
Maybe you can draft up
a letter to the investors:

06:15.074 --> 06:17.907
<i>"Yes, the stock is unfrozen.</i>
<i>We urge you not to sell."</i>

06:18.010 --> 06:21.537
Uh, yeah. Wh-What you just said was
perfect. Why do you want me to write it?

06:21.647 --> 06:25.583
Just send it out on your stationery.
And do it quickly. I have a car to buy.

06:25.685 --> 06:29.917
<i>Meanwhile, Maeby snuck</i>
<i>upstairs to secretly read her scripts.</i>

06:30.022 --> 06:34.482
Ow! Back to film school-

06:36.028 --> 06:39.555
<i>And George Sr. Was only too happy</i>
<i>to have something to read.</i>

06:39.665 --> 06:42.293
<i>Armageddon."</i>

06:42.402 --> 06:45.565
That's a bad title.

06:45.671 --> 06:49.402
<i>Meanwhile, Michael went to get</i>
<i>a good deal on a modest company car.</i>

06:49.509 --> 06:52.637
Oh, something like this?
We have, like, 400 of these.

06:52.745 --> 06:54.940
L- I don't need
anything too popular.

06:55.047 --> 06:56.981
Oh, they're not popular.
We have 400 of them.

06:57.083 --> 06:58.983
Sold.

06:59.085 --> 07:03.488
Although, uh, I'm wondering if maybe
it should just be a little bit nicer.

07:03.589 --> 07:06.956
I got a kid, and safety's kind of
a factor. But nothing too flashy.

07:07.059 --> 07:10.995
This is it, isn't it?
I can tell. You're excited.

07:11.097 --> 07:13.065
- I am.
- I'll draw up the papers.

07:13.166 --> 07:16.329
Unless you think it's too drab.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.336
And it gets very good mileage.

07:18.438 --> 07:21.339
Yeah, well, it, uh- it looks light.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.534
You know, I'm not
so concerned about mileage.

07:23.643 --> 07:27.135
I spent the last 10 years on a bike,
with the exception of the stair car.

07:27.246 --> 07:29.874
Oh, you're the stair car guy.
You took down our banner.

07:29.982 --> 07:33.008
Yeah. Sorry.
I got a hop-on.

07:33.119 --> 07:35.451
I got distracted.
I hate this.

07:35.555 --> 07:38.649
I like these sunglasses.
They come with any car?

07:38.758 --> 07:42.558
Just this one. They throw these extras
at you because it's so impractical.

07:42.662 --> 07:44.857
No back seat.
It attracts so many tickets...

07:44.964 --> 07:47.626
the insurance alone costs as much
as the last three cars we saw.

07:47.733 --> 07:49.633
The windbreaker?
Windbreaker comes with it too?

07:49.735 --> 07:52.363
I guess. I don't know. I've never
sold one of these before, so-

07:52.472 --> 07:55.202
I'll take it.

07:59.145 --> 08:02.637
<i>Michael hadjust indulged</i>
<i>himself with an expensive sports car</i>-

08:02.748 --> 08:04.648
And here again, please.

08:04.750 --> 08:07.981
<i>While Buster indulged</i>
<i>in a night out with Tobias.</i>

08:08.087 --> 08:10.317
This place is exactly
what I had hoped for.

08:10.423 --> 08:13.483
- All ladies.
- Mmm.

08:13.593 --> 08:16.153
Well, I've heard that this uniform
is the best way to meet-

08:16.262 --> 08:19.231
- Lucille 2!
- Buster!

08:19.332 --> 08:22.733
- So you're back.
- Oh, I'm back, Buster!

08:22.835 --> 08:26.396
- Yeah?
- And I am rock steady! No more dizzies.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.872
<i>Lucille Austero hadjust returned...</i>

08:28.975 --> 08:33.912
<i>from a month-long stay at a facility that</i>
<i>specialized in the treatment of vertigo.</i>

08:34.013 --> 08:37.210
Ah. Ah, just a minute. You're okay.

08:37.316 --> 08:39.716
You're okay. You're okay.
We're okay. We're okay!

08:39.818 --> 08:43.118
Somebody'll be here in a second.
We're okay. We're okay.

08:43.222 --> 08:45.190
I am stable as a table.

08:45.291 --> 08:49.455
So, is there a-
a girl in your life?

08:49.562 --> 08:53.123
Well, I would hardly
call my mother a girl.

08:53.232 --> 08:55.462
But, yeah, she's still
very much a part of my life.

08:55.568 --> 08:59.595
No, I mean, uh, someone
who makes you hear music.

08:59.705 --> 09:02.674
Oh. Well, she mostly
likes talk radio.

09:02.775 --> 09:07.474
I mean, a girl who
makes you feel romantic...

09:07.580 --> 09:10.913
and also who makes you
hear beautiful music.

09:11.017 --> 09:13.076
Oh. No.

09:13.185 --> 09:17.087
I guess what I'm trying to say is-

09:20.593 --> 09:23.391
Everybody thinks
they're Frank Sinatra.

09:23.496 --> 09:26.829
- Maybe we could start anew.

09:29.936 --> 09:33.167
<i>And later, Michael got</i>
<i>an urgent call from his mother.</i>

09:33.272 --> 09:37.436
He's with her again.
Buster's taken up with that Lucille 2.

09:37.543 --> 09:39.443
That's why you called me here?

09:39.545 --> 09:42.207
I've got my secretary bringing over
a bunch of important papers.

09:42.315 --> 09:44.749
- I thought this was urgent.
- Well, it's all your fault.

09:44.850 --> 09:47.751
You're the one who insisted
he get away from Mother.

09:47.853 --> 09:50.754
Well, I wasn't trying to send him
to a new one. Where is he?

09:50.856 --> 09:52.756
He's on the balcony.

09:52.858 --> 09:55.554
Buster?

09:55.661 --> 09:57.856
Mom's becoming a little controlling.

09:57.964 --> 10:00.432
<i>What tripped you off? When she</i>
<i>locked you out on the balcony again?</i>

10:00.533 --> 10:04.526
That was half my fault. I thought
I saw a graham cracker out there.

10:04.637 --> 10:07.800
- <i>You baited the balcony?</i>
- Prove it.

10:07.907 --> 10:10.239
<i>So I don't typically</i>
<i>take sides with Mother...</i>

10:10.343 --> 10:13.073
but l-l-I do agree that Lucille 2...

10:13.179 --> 10:16.307
might not be
the best choice for you.

10:16.415 --> 10:19.111
I wouldn't even have been there
if Mom wanted to go bowling.

10:19.218 --> 10:21.618
How am I gonna meet someone
who has my interests?

10:21.721 --> 10:23.279
- Hi, Michael.
- Hey. Great.

10:23.389 --> 10:25.289
- I have those papers for you to sign.
- Perfect.

10:25.391 --> 10:27.552
<i>By the way, I love your mother.</i>

10:27.660 --> 10:30.026
- Oh, yeah, I do too.
- Oh.

10:31.831 --> 10:35.267
I think I may have found
a new girl for Buster.

10:35.368 --> 10:39.270
Good. That Lucille isn't really
interested in Buster anyway.

10:39.372 --> 10:42.808
- She's just trying to get even with me.
- Get even with you for what?

10:42.908 --> 10:46.503
She wanted me to let in her remodeling
crew while she was out of town.

10:46.612 --> 10:49.843
Wait a minute. This tub's
a little bigger than it used to be.

10:49.949 --> 10:53.510
<i>It was.</i>
<i>Instead ofletting the construction crew...</i>

10:53.619 --> 10:55.519
- <i>into Lucille Austero's penthouse</i>-
- Come right in.

10:55.621 --> 10:58.351
<i>Lucille had put them to work</i>
<i>on a project ofher own.</i>

10:59.759 --> 11:03.661
- What'd you do?
- Well, I sat on one of these jets.

11:03.763 --> 11:07.290
<i>- But I think we can fix it.</i>
- Don't give me that look.

11:07.400 --> 11:11.166
I moved the wall a couple
of inches into her penthouse.

11:11.270 --> 11:14.865
Don't think she's not over there
right now, plotting her revenge.

11:17.777 --> 11:20.769
God, the new equilibrium
really does-

11:20.880 --> 11:23.678
It makes the room seem tighter.

11:24.984 --> 11:27.384
<i>She's always a step ahead of me.</i>

11:27.486 --> 11:29.545
That's what makes her
such a worthy opponent.

11:29.655 --> 11:33.318
- How'd you pay for it?
- I cashed in some stock. You knew it was unfrozen.

11:33.426 --> 11:37.192
I know. I sent you that letter. It says
not to sell, or we're gonna lose control.

11:37.296 --> 11:40.857
<i>It does? I stopped at "unfrozen."</i>

11:40.966 --> 11:44.197
<i>Lindsay, you didn't cash in your stock,</i>
<i>did you? Tell me you didn't.</i>

11:44.303 --> 11:46.203
- I didn't.
- <i>Yet.</i>

11:46.305 --> 11:48.933
There's a pretty long wait list
for membership right now.

11:49.041 --> 11:51.373
Gob, you didn't sell, did you?

11:51.477 --> 11:56.073
What? No. I'm trying to get
a job from you, Mikey. Come on.

11:56.182 --> 11:58.878
Okay. As long as you two didn't sell,
I think we should be okay.

11:58.984 --> 12:01.214
- I was afraid that l-
- I just bought the Queen Mary.

12:01.320 --> 12:04.050
<i>You're kidding.</i>
<i>I was just gonna get a yacht.</i>

12:04.156 --> 12:08.058
No, no, no. The club. I was dancing with
what turned out to be the club's owner...

12:08.160 --> 12:11.152
and he was looking to sell.

12:11.263 --> 12:13.823
Oh, he really, really
did look like a woman.

12:13.933 --> 12:17.232
But anyhoo, can you believe that
the only reason the club is going under...

12:17.336 --> 12:19.395
is because it's
in a terrifying neighborhood?

12:19.505 --> 12:22.167
- This is unbelievable.
- Tobias, I promised that money
to the country club.

12:22.274 --> 12:25.732
- Country club?
- It's in such a good neighborhood.

12:25.845 --> 12:28.006
I don't believe this.
Did you guys not read the letter?

12:28.114 --> 12:31.413
<i>None of them</i>
<i>had read past the word "unfrozen."</i>

12:31.517 --> 12:33.508
I hope you're all proud of yourselves.

12:33.619 --> 12:36.986
Your careless, selfish spending sprees
may have cost us the Bluth Company.

12:37.089 --> 12:38.989
Hey, Dad, is that
your new car in the driveway?

12:39.091 --> 12:42.026
I can't believe you got a Corvette!

12:42.128 --> 12:44.790
It's a company car.

12:48.768 --> 12:51.259
<i>Michael had bought a car...</i>

12:51.370 --> 12:53.600
<i>and it had helped</i>
<i>put the company in jeopardy.</i>

12:53.706 --> 12:57.472
I'm sorry about the patch. I'm testifying
against the Kings this afternoon.

12:57.576 --> 12:59.976
You can't see it. I just winked.

13:00.079 --> 13:04.209
<i>So basically, you're</i>
<i>about 2,000 shares short...</i>

13:04.316 --> 13:06.784
of being the majority stockholders.

13:06.886 --> 13:09.286
<i>Now unfortunately, it's a private stock...</i>

13:09.388 --> 13:13.119
<i>so you cannotjust buy up the shares</i>
<i>unless someone is willing to sell.</i>

13:13.225 --> 13:15.887
- Are you sure?
- That's what they said on AskJeeves.

13:15.995 --> 13:19.487
- All right, who's the majority shareholder now?
- A company called Standpoor.

13:19.598 --> 13:23.694
- Standpoor?
- As in the opposite of Sitwell...

13:23.803 --> 13:26.203
which is run by a certain
hairless man...

13:26.305 --> 13:28.535
who could be very upset
with you right now.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.836
What would he have to be upset
with me about?

13:30.943 --> 13:34.811
- You're wearing his eyebrows?
- They make me feel dressier.

13:37.049 --> 13:39.950
- Hello?
- Is it true, Michael? Did we lose the company?

13:40.052 --> 13:43.852
Kind of. To something called
Standpoor. Yeah, it's Sitwell.

13:43.956 --> 13:47.392
- It's Lucille Austero.
- Lucille 2?

13:47.493 --> 13:51.020
<i>Standpoor, because she can't</i>
<i>stand up without falling over.</i>

13:51.130 --> 13:54.691
I don't know why she'd have any trouble.
A piano could stand on those legs.

13:54.800 --> 13:57.360
<i>She's trying to get even</i>
<i>with me for the remodeling.</i>

13:57.469 --> 14:00.905
I think we're gonna need
a new floating thermometer.

14:01.006 --> 14:03.338
Could I have your-
your Blue Cross number?

14:03.442 --> 14:07.936
Well, let's think about this, Mom. I mean,
maybe there's a way that we can reason with her-

14:08.047 --> 14:09.947
- Give her Buster.
- What?

14:10.049 --> 14:13.177
- We need our company back.
- Mom, that's horrible.

14:13.285 --> 14:16.686
I don't suppose <i>you've</i> spent money
on something <i>you</i> can return?

14:16.789 --> 14:18.620
- Sweet ride, dude.
- <i>Let's give her Buster.</i>

14:19.892 --> 14:21.792
Starla, do you know
where my brother is?

14:21.894 --> 14:24.522
<i>Yes, he's on cloud nine.</i>
<i>That was me, Michael.</i>

14:24.630 --> 14:26.757
What's going on?
Where's Starla?

14:26.866 --> 14:29.232
Oh, she's saying good-bye
to someone named Q.

14:29.335 --> 14:32.371
If she can get past his security system,
she's gonna tell him it's over.

14:32.371 --> 14:33.133
If she can get past his security system,
she's gonna tell him it's over.

14:33.239 --> 14:35.230
She's amazing.

14:35.341 --> 14:39.141
We completely connected.
And it's all because of you.

14:39.245 --> 14:42.078
You made this happen.

14:42.181 --> 14:44.081
I feel alive!

14:44.183 --> 14:47.311
<i>Indeed,</i>
<i>Starla and Buster did hit it off well</i>-

14:47.419 --> 14:51.549
<i>Buster being a sweeter, more supportive</i>
<i>man than she was used to...</i>

14:51.657 --> 14:54.387
<i>and Starla being a woman</i>
<i>that wasn't 70.</i>

14:54.493 --> 14:59.396
<i>I'm just wondering if you</i>
<i>didn't upgrade a little too fast.</i>

14:59.498 --> 15:03.901
You know, you want something sensible, you
end up getting pushed into something flashy.

15:04.003 --> 15:05.766
What does that mean?

15:05.871 --> 15:08.237
Don't you think
you belong in a Lucille?

15:14.546 --> 15:17.071
<i>Maeby, meanwhile,</i>
<i>gave reading her script another shot...</i>

15:17.182 --> 15:20.447
<i>only to discover her work was done.</i>

15:20.552 --> 15:22.918
<i>Her scripts had been noted.</i>

15:23.022 --> 15:25.718
<i>So she went to find the person</i>
<i>she thought was responsible.</i>

15:25.824 --> 15:28.258
George Michael,
I read your notes.

15:28.360 --> 15:31.420
What? You-
Oh, you found the-

15:31.530 --> 15:33.828
- Well, look, I don't-That was a long-
- They were great.

15:33.933 --> 15:37.869
I mean, they said so many things I wanted
to say, but I didn't know how, you know?

15:37.970 --> 15:39.938
Don't tell anyone, okay?

15:40.039 --> 15:42.599
Never.

15:46.211 --> 15:48.338
I guess she didn't see the drawings.

15:48.447 --> 15:51.883
<i>Meanwhile, Tobias prepared</i>
<i>to assume ownership of the Queen Mary.</i>

15:51.984 --> 15:55.283
No, no. It's supposed to say
"Tobias's Queen Mary."

15:55.387 --> 15:59.448
No, that is not what it says.
I distinct- Hello?

16:00.893 --> 16:03.191
Well, I suppose I could just
paint over "Mary."

16:03.295 --> 16:05.786
Don't bother, man.
This is our club now.

16:10.235 --> 16:14.365
<i>Tobias didn't want to sell</i>
<i>his new club, but Lindsay did.</i>

16:14.473 --> 16:18.637
<i>Which is why she hired several members</i>
<i>of a local stripper agency...</i>

16:18.744 --> 16:21.542
<i>called the Hot Cops</i>
<i>to pose as the roughnecks.</i>

16:21.647 --> 16:24.810
All right, fellas, look. I know you know
nothing but a life on the street...

16:24.917 --> 16:27.818
but I'd like to offer you something
that the Queen Mary gave me.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.854
The joy of the stage.

16:29.955 --> 16:32.981
So maybe you could, uh,
start jeté-ing...

16:33.092 --> 16:36.493
and stop "je-terrorizing" me.

16:36.595 --> 16:39.428
- Yeah!
- Absolutely!

16:39.531 --> 16:42.159
- We could do <i>Rent.</i>
- Well, this is joyous news.

16:42.267 --> 16:45.259
<i>And Buster,</i>
<i>now convinced that Lucille 2...</i>

16:45.371 --> 16:49.000
<i>was the right woman for him,</i>
<i>broke up with Starla.</i>

16:50.542 --> 16:52.442
You okay?

16:52.544 --> 16:54.842
It was for the best anyway.

16:54.947 --> 16:58.883
A girl like that deserves to be taken
care of, and I'm just a poor soldier.

16:58.984 --> 17:01.509
You didn't sell your stock?

17:01.620 --> 17:04.555
What? No. Your letter said not to...

17:04.656 --> 17:06.920
and I would never
want to hurt the family.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.493
<i>And Michael realized his little brother...</i>

17:09.595 --> 17:11.722
<i>deserved happiness more than anyone.</i>

17:11.829 --> 17:14.594
You know, uh, I want you
to forget about what I said.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.599
I was wrong.
You two belong together.

17:16.702 --> 17:18.761
I'll take care of Lucille 2 for you.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.862
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:20.973 --> 17:25.376
Let her down easy. That right knee
could go at any time.

17:25.477 --> 17:27.877
Starla!

17:27.980 --> 17:30.881
<i>And at the "Tobias is Queen Mary"...</i>

17:30.983 --> 17:33.645
<i>Tobias couldn't believe</i>
<i>how quickly he had gotten through...</i>

17:33.752 --> 17:38.212
<i>to his ragtag gang of neighborhood toughs.</i>

17:38.323 --> 17:42.225
Wow. You really have made
some amazing strides in a half an hour.

17:42.327 --> 17:44.386
<i>We have to take this to the streets.</i>

17:44.496 --> 17:46.896
We have to strut!

17:46.999 --> 17:49.058
<i>Michael knew ifhe had any chance...</i>

17:49.168 --> 17:51.500
<i>of getting control of the company again...</i>

17:51.603 --> 17:53.662
- <i>he would need to charm Lucille 2.</i>
- Lucille 2.

17:53.772 --> 17:55.933
- Your hair!
- Can I take you for a spin?

17:56.041 --> 18:00.000
<i>But the spin in Michael's</i>
<i>new car retriggered her vertigo.</i>

18:00.112 --> 18:04.242
<i>That night, Tobias's plan</i>
<i>to change the streets with his gang...</i>

18:04.349 --> 18:06.943
<i>also turned out to be ill-conceived.</i>

18:07.052 --> 18:10.283
<i>Hey, "fezellas,"looks like</i>
<i>you guys are up to no good.</i>

18:10.389 --> 18:15.088
Well, this gang used to be
like that too- three, four!

18:15.194 --> 18:18.095
So you think you're tough
Well, we hate rappin'

18:18.197 --> 18:20.665
But don't bust a cap in
'Cause here's what's happenin'

18:20.766 --> 18:23.929
<i>We're breakin'out</i>
<i>some old-fashioned tappin'</i>

18:26.071 --> 18:27.971
Oh, I've been shot!

18:28.073 --> 18:31.440
- We miscalculated! Retreat!
- Quick, switch to <i>Follies</i>!

18:31.543 --> 18:33.875
That's not gonna help!

18:33.979 --> 18:38.313
<i>Meanwhile, Michael and</i>
<i>Lucille 2 arrived to find the club nearly empty.</i>

18:38.417 --> 18:40.476
<i>Although Michael</i>
<i>would have fit in perfectly.</i>

18:40.586 --> 18:43.521
Something? It's probably-
I'll tell you what, Lucille.

18:43.622 --> 18:46.420
- I'm gonna take you dancing, huh?
- No, Michael, please.

18:46.525 --> 18:49.460
You have undone all
of Dr. Sandor Plumb's work.

18:49.561 --> 18:53.964
Oh, I'm sorry. Look, the reason
that I showed up tonight...

18:54.066 --> 18:58.059
was because I don't think that it's right
for you to be dating my brother.

18:58.170 --> 19:00.832
I mean, he's met someone else,
and, frankly...

19:00.939 --> 19:03.032
the only reason that
he asked you out tonight...

19:03.142 --> 19:06.407
was because I wanted him to get
the stock back from you...

19:06.512 --> 19:09.003
so that I could regain
control of the company.

19:09.114 --> 19:12.515
But I would- I'd rather
have my brother back.

19:12.618 --> 19:15.314
So- I'm sorry.

19:15.420 --> 19:17.513
- I understand.
- Thank you.

19:17.623 --> 19:22.185
And I do not blame you for
not liking the Bluths anymore.

19:22.294 --> 19:25.092
Like the Bluths?
I love the Bluths.

19:25.197 --> 19:28.997
- Why did you buy up all of our company stock?
- To support you guys.

19:29.101 --> 19:34.835
I have always had a standing order
to buy up any available Bluth stock.

19:34.940 --> 19:38.603
You do know that we're about 2,000 shares
short of controlling the company now.

19:38.710 --> 19:41.873
- Well, you could have some of mine.
- Really? Would you do that?

19:41.980 --> 19:44.710
- Yeah, of course.
- Well, that's-Thank you.

19:44.816 --> 19:47.114
- Actually, there is a condition.
- Anything.

19:47.219 --> 19:51.883
- Call me a cab.
- Ah, because of my driving. Yes.

19:51.990 --> 19:54.049
<i>And so the next day...</i>

19:54.159 --> 19:56.923
<i>Michael was thrilled to have</i>
<i>control of the company back.</i>

19:57.029 --> 19:58.997
- I fixed everything.
- <i>Oh?</i>

19:59.097 --> 20:02.089
With the business.
It's all taken care of.

20:02.201 --> 20:05.796
- You didn't think I could, but I did.
- Gob, what'd you do?

20:05.904 --> 20:10.034
Hi.
- <i>Gob had run into Lucille 2</i>
<i>after Michael dropped her off.</i>

20:10.142 --> 20:12.201
My mom really took up
a bunch of your space, huh?

20:12.311 --> 20:14.871
- What a bitch.
- What do you mean?

20:14.980 --> 20:17.813
When she expanded her bathroom
and moved your wall over.

20:17.916 --> 20:20.714
That's why all your stuff s
sticking out.

20:20.819 --> 20:23.219
Oh.

20:23.322 --> 20:28.726
Your mother really has a way of getting my goat.

20:28.827 --> 20:30.795
<i>So Gob- Lucille 2.</i>

20:30.896 --> 20:34.764
- You what?
- Oh, and she's not gonna give
the shares back now.

20:34.866 --> 20:38.063
- You just said that you fixed everything.
- Oh, I meant <i>my</i> problems.

20:38.170 --> 20:40.730
Yeah, she's gonna make me
the new president.

20:42.274 --> 20:46.506
You don't need to prove
yourself to me, little brother.

20:46.612 --> 20:49.410
You will always have a job here.

20:49.514 --> 20:52.142
But I do need the keys
to the company car.

20:53.952 --> 20:57.513
<i>On the next</i> Arrested Development-

20:57.623 --> 21:00.558
<i>Lucille 2 reclaims some space.</i>

21:02.527 --> 21:05.462
<i>The Queen Mary</i>
<i>changes hands once again.</i>

21:05.564 --> 21:09.466
L-I've wanted a small family restaurant
since I got the Kings settlement.

21:09.568 --> 21:11.798
It still has the dungeon area, right?

21:11.903 --> 21:14.235
<i>And Gob gets needy.</i>

21:14.339 --> 21:16.569
- Oh.
- Let's go for it.
