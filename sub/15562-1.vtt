00:00.008 --> 00:01.975
I'm having this baby here!

00:02.011 --> 00:03.476
Cheyenne, this is unacceptable.

00:03.512 --> 00:05.386
You're suspended with pay.

00:05.412 --> 00:07.510
What you did back there was awesome.

00:07.510 --> 00:09.342
- They let me go.
- They fired Glenn.

00:09.378 --> 00:10.711
So about that walkout?

00:10.746 --> 00:12.358
I know you're scared,

00:12.358 --> 00:16.181
but rest assured Cloud 9
will be fine without you.

00:18.197 --> 00:20.601
Oh, and have a heavenly day.

00:34.412 --> 00:36.479
That's what I think of her.

00:36.514 --> 00:38.581
Yeah, she's a fart noise.

00:38.650 --> 00:40.483
Yeah!

00:41.919 --> 00:42.385
Yeah.

00:42.386 --> 00:43.751
Listen, who cares about Dina?

00:44.285 --> 00:45.384
- We did it.
- Yeah!

00:45.453 --> 00:48.353
We did it!

00:55.862 --> 00:57.727
So do we just go home now or...

- Synced and corrected by hawken45 -

01:06.601 --> 01:08.902
- All the time, man.
- Yeah? So you heard it too?

01:10.405 --> 01:11.537
Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am,

01:11.573 --> 01:12.772
please, let me help you with that, okay?

01:12.841 --> 01:13.773
- Oh, thanks.
- You're welcome.

01:13.842 --> 01:15.241
- Glenn!
- What?

01:15.276 --> 01:16.542
What are you doing, man?
We're protesting.

01:16.578 --> 01:19.745
Oh, right! Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am.

01:19.780 --> 01:21.546
I'm... I'm... Good luck with that.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.515
Oh, my God, what have I done?

01:23.550 --> 01:25.617
Okay, I never meant to get
involved in a strike.

01:25.686 --> 01:27.318
I just got caught up in the drama.

01:27.318 --> 01:29.303
- This is not a strike.
- Yeah, it is.

01:29.329 --> 01:30.361
What would you call it?

01:30.397 --> 01:32.030
A... demonstration?

01:33.067 --> 01:34.866
An expression of discontentedness?

01:34.902 --> 01:36.668
I don't know, we're just here
to get Glenn's job back.

01:36.703 --> 01:38.569
Mm, "Noun. A refusal to work",

01:38.604 --> 01:41.371
organized by a body of employees
as a form of protest."

01:41.407 --> 01:42.606
Okay, it doesn't matter what we call it.

01:42.675 --> 01:43.941
Cool, then we'll just call it a strike.

01:44.010 --> 01:45.876
- It's not a strike.
- Guys, should we be concerned

01:45.912 --> 01:48.879
that a Cloud 9 corporate
car just pulled in?

01:48.915 --> 01:49.802
We are screwed.

01:49.803 --> 01:52.767
They just sent an enforcer
to drop the hammer on us.

01:59.244 --> 02:00.510
Dennis, did I put you on go-backs

02:00.546 --> 02:02.011
or did I tell you to stand around crying

02:02.047 --> 02:03.246
about your dead dog all day?

02:03.282 --> 02:04.881
Get in the game. We're understaffed.

02:04.916 --> 02:05.848
Hi.

02:05.884 --> 02:07.217
Oh, who buys these?

02:07.252 --> 02:09.051
Excuse me.

02:09.086 --> 02:11.086
Hi, I'm Jeff Sutton.
I'm the District Manager.

02:11.121 --> 02:13.088
Could I see some ID?

02:13.123 --> 02:14.089
Sure.

02:14.124 --> 02:16.091
Just a second.

02:18.262 --> 02:20.229
You photograph terribly. Never model.

02:20.264 --> 02:21.385
Uh, who are you?

02:21.386 --> 02:23.051
Dina Fox, Assistant Manager.

02:23.087 --> 02:24.786
Well, I used to be Assistant Manager.

02:24.855 --> 02:26.688
I had to resign my position
in order to pursue

02:26.724 --> 02:28.056
a sexual relationship
with a subordinate.

02:28.091 --> 02:29.924
Didn't work out.
Not really your business.

02:29.959 --> 02:32.167
Anyway, I've gone ahead
and taken my old job back.

02:32.167 --> 02:36.459
Okay, I'm gonna have to let
Corporate know about that.

02:36.460 --> 02:37.993
I get it. You want me to work for it.

02:38.029 --> 02:39.327
Show you I got what it takes.

02:39.363 --> 02:40.562
- Here we go.
- Okay.

02:40.597 --> 02:42.430
How many you want, 50? Hundred?

02:42.499 --> 02:43.415
I could for sure do seven.

02:43.416 --> 02:44.327
No, thank you.

02:44.328 --> 02:46.455
No push-ups are necessary
today for this.

02:46.481 --> 02:48.647
Maybe just run outside
and grab whoever's in charge

02:48.683 --> 02:50.215
and ask them to come in for a meeting?

02:50.250 --> 02:51.550
Of course.

02:51.586 --> 02:53.486
I mean, that's what an
assistant manager does, right?

02:53.521 --> 02:54.653
- Yes.
- And for the record,

02:54.689 --> 02:56.221
your body would photograph great.

02:56.256 --> 02:57.565
It's just your face that's bad.

02:57.566 --> 02:59.832
- Oh.
- Jump on register one, Jeff.

02:59.900 --> 03:01.266
Oh, hi.

03:01.301 --> 03:02.500
Um...

03:05.004 --> 03:07.405
Excuse me.

03:07.441 --> 03:08.506
Your boos fuel me.

03:08.575 --> 03:09.977
I'm here to talk to the heat.

03:09.977 --> 03:11.343
I assume Amy and I are the heat?

03:11.413 --> 03:13.646
District Manager
Jeff Sutton wants a meeting.

03:13.682 --> 03:15.848
Okay, yeah. We'll talk.

03:15.917 --> 03:17.983
Yes! I knew I could get you.

03:18.018 --> 03:20.652
All right, break room, ten minutes.

03:20.688 --> 03:23.089
If you're not there by then...

03:23.124 --> 03:25.357
well, we'll wait.

03:25.426 --> 03:26.959
Okay, what are our demands?

03:26.994 --> 03:28.260
No, we don't have demands.

03:28.296 --> 03:29.795
We just want Glenn's job back.

03:29.830 --> 03:31.634
- Hear, hear.
- And if they say no,

03:31.635 --> 03:33.001
we go back to work anyway!

03:33.069 --> 03:34.501
Mateo.

03:34.569 --> 03:36.904
Why not try to get more
than Glenn's job back, right?

03:36.939 --> 03:38.071
I mean, we're already on strike.

03:38.107 --> 03:39.299
We're not on strike.

03:39.300 --> 03:41.968
We're already on expression
of discontentedness.

03:42.003 --> 03:43.737
Why not ask for things like...

03:43.772 --> 03:45.905
like, uh, better health insurance?

03:45.941 --> 03:47.473
And we don't get paid for overtime,

03:47.508 --> 03:48.842
even when we work overtime.

03:48.910 --> 03:50.176
There you go, Sandra.

03:50.245 --> 03:52.444
Yeah, they should let us
vape in the store, right?

03:52.479 --> 03:53.033
Well...

03:53.034 --> 03:56.330
I want Cloud 9 to be closer to my house.

03:56.356 --> 03:59.371
Guys, if we go in there
asking for everything,

03:59.406 --> 04:02.040
we're gonna get nothing, okay?

04:02.075 --> 04:04.209
We need to get Glenn's job back.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.044
Oh, so just like that

04:06.079 --> 04:07.411
and the vaping thing, huh?

04:07.446 --> 04:09.180
Yeah, good idea, madam.

04:09.215 --> 04:10.548
Dougie, we all know that's you.

04:10.583 --> 04:13.384
You're the only one who vapes.

04:48.018 --> 04:50.827
I'm not making fun of you.
It's just so pink.

04:50.853 --> 04:52.286
It's all they had in my size.

04:52.321 --> 04:54.288
And will you please take off
that stupid fedora?

04:54.323 --> 04:55.489
It completes the look.

04:55.524 --> 04:57.491
You look like Carmen Sandiego.

04:58.873 --> 05:00.840
We do not negotiate with terrorists.

05:00.875 --> 05:03.075
Who's the terrorist
in this scenario, Dina?

05:03.144 --> 05:04.143
That suit you're wearing.

05:04.179 --> 05:05.845
Eh, no one's a terrorist.

05:05.880 --> 05:07.413
Again, you don't have to be here.

05:07.481 --> 05:09.682
Oh, I'm not gonna leave you
alone with these two monsters.

05:09.717 --> 05:13.019
Okay, so why don't you guys
just tell me what you want?

05:13.054 --> 05:14.586
Well, Jeff, it's really quite...

05:14.655 --> 05:17.022
I'm sorry, Jeff.
I'm gonna need a minute.

05:17.057 --> 05:18.523
I'm not saying anything.

05:18.558 --> 05:19.724
I'm just doing this to intimidate him.

05:19.759 --> 05:21.860
Nod your head.

05:21.895 --> 05:23.594
That was way too big. Smaller nods.

05:23.663 --> 05:25.730
Okay, now giggle like
I said something charming.

05:25.765 --> 05:27.199
Okay, Jeff, what we want

05:27.234 --> 05:29.599
is for Glenn to be rehired
as Store Manager.

05:29.599 --> 05:31.664
I would sooner slit my
throat and Jeff's throat

05:31.733 --> 05:33.132
before I'd let that happen.

05:33.167 --> 05:35.268
Dina, if... if you're gonna be here,

05:35.303 --> 05:36.603
I just need you to observe.

05:36.638 --> 05:38.971
Ah, Assistant Manager style.

05:39.007 --> 05:40.072
I got it.

05:40.108 --> 05:43.676
So I am authorized to rehire Glenn.

05:43.745 --> 05:45.311
Really?

05:45.346 --> 05:47.346
Well, that's... that's great.

05:47.416 --> 05:49.281
Fantastic news, Jeff. Thanks.

05:49.316 --> 05:51.149
Take that off.

05:51.184 --> 05:52.451
Corporate is just asking

05:52.486 --> 05:55.516
that you and the rest
of the employees sign here.

05:55.517 --> 05:56.757
Then everybody can get back to work,

05:56.757 --> 05:58.224
and I can go home, which is a relief

05:58.259 --> 05:59.725
'cause they've got me in a
motel out by the airport.

05:59.760 --> 06:00.759
It says, "continental breakfast,"

06:00.794 --> 06:01.894
but it's, like, cereal and toast.

06:01.929 --> 06:02.895
I'm like, "I can make that at home."

06:02.930 --> 06:03.896
Not even a muffin?

06:03.931 --> 06:04.908
I didn't look. I was running late.

06:04.908 --> 06:07.608
I'm sorry, excuse me.
This is an apology letter.

06:07.677 --> 06:10.878
Are you asking us to
apologize for walking out?

06:10.913 --> 06:12.379
I know it's annoying,

06:12.414 --> 06:15.015
but you're gonna have to give
Corporate a little something.

06:15.051 --> 06:17.250
Oh.

06:17.286 --> 06:19.953
We're supposed to give
Corporate a little something.

06:20.022 --> 06:23.289
That's hilarious because you
fired our boss for giving

06:23.357 --> 06:25.892
Cheyenne maternity leave.
You don't give us overtime.

06:25.927 --> 06:28.372
You don't give us health
insurance, and we're not allowed

06:28.398 --> 06:30.071
to vape in the store. Myrtle's got a...

06:30.071 --> 06:31.752
Maybe not as high up
on the priority list.

06:31.753 --> 06:33.719
Okay, can I offer some advice?

06:33.753 --> 06:35.953
You guys walked out with no planning.

06:35.988 --> 06:38.089
You have no experience.

06:38.124 --> 06:40.423
I can see the tag on your sleeve.

06:40.458 --> 06:43.059
My point is you're just in
way over your heads.

06:43.095 --> 06:46.295
So sign the letter. Say thank you.

06:46.331 --> 06:49.733
And then don't do anything
you're gonna regret.

06:51.903 --> 06:54.303
- We are on strike!
- We are still on strike!

06:54.339 --> 06:55.489
Why do you have to be like that?

06:55.489 --> 06:58.389
We are on strike for the first time!

06:59.661 --> 07:01.361
So they wouldn't give Glenn's job back?

07:01.429 --> 07:02.529
No, they offered it to us,

07:02.597 --> 07:05.544
but we said, "That's not good enough."

07:05.570 --> 07:07.818
- Yeah.
- All right!

07:07.819 --> 07:09.739
Turning down my job!

07:09.740 --> 07:11.521
What an awesome idea!

07:11.522 --> 07:13.588
Glenn, your job is still a priority,

07:13.657 --> 07:15.490
and we can get that and more.

07:15.526 --> 07:16.591
Sandra, you were saying

07:16.660 --> 07:17.859
you weren't getting paid for overtime?

07:17.894 --> 07:19.027
I didn't mean to complain.

07:19.063 --> 07:21.062
No, Sandra, you were right to complain.

07:21.097 --> 07:23.664
This is what change looks like.

07:23.699 --> 07:26.700
Regular people like us demanding action.

07:26.735 --> 07:29.537
Corporate says we're in over our heads.

07:29.572 --> 07:32.039
I think we're in under our heads.

07:34.128 --> 07:35.361
Just go with it, guys.

07:35.430 --> 07:36.829
She's going, she's flowing.

07:36.864 --> 07:38.362
She's dressed like Barbara Bush.

07:38.363 --> 07:41.005
Tomorrow we're gonna
come back with signs.

07:41.031 --> 07:42.947
- We're gonna have T-shirts.
- T-shirts.

07:42.948 --> 07:45.333
We're gonna have one
of those big, inflatable rats.

07:45.359 --> 07:46.644
Yes, and we are gonna...

07:46.645 --> 07:48.076
Burn down the store!

07:48.402 --> 07:50.074
Um, good energy, Dougie.

07:50.100 --> 07:52.234
- I like where your head's at.
- No bad ideas.

07:52.269 --> 07:54.236
So who's ready to stick it to Cloud 9?

07:54.271 --> 07:55.636
All right!

07:55.671 --> 07:56.770
- Yeah!
- That's right.

07:56.805 --> 07:58.972
As Dr. Martin Luther King once said...

07:59.008 --> 08:00.807
- No, no.
- No. No is right.

08:00.843 --> 08:01.975
We'll see you tomorrow.

08:02.011 --> 08:04.709
For our first day of strike!

08:04.709 --> 08:06.575
Boycott Cloud 9!

08:06.611 --> 08:08.778
Boycott Cloud 9!

08:08.846 --> 08:10.446
Boycott Cloud 9!

08:10.515 --> 08:12.781
Boycott Cloud 9!

08:12.849 --> 08:14.283
Well, this came together really well.

08:14.351 --> 08:15.918
- I mean, one day.
- Yeah.

08:15.953 --> 08:17.852
And it's kinda nice to be out here

08:17.888 --> 08:19.687
doing something important.

08:19.723 --> 08:20.755
Yeah.

08:20.791 --> 08:23.959
Someone needs to clean the porta potty.

08:24.028 --> 08:26.561
What porta potty?

08:26.596 --> 08:28.263
Boycott Cloud 9!

08:28.299 --> 08:29.863
Boycott Cloud 9!

08:29.899 --> 08:30.864
Oh, God.

08:30.900 --> 08:32.466
Okay, everybody needs

08:32.534 --> 08:34.735
to stay out of the garden shed.

08:35.972 --> 08:37.571
Morning. How was your night?

08:37.606 --> 08:38.806
Oh, not great actually.

08:38.883 --> 08:40.049
They put me in a room by the runway,

08:40.076 --> 08:40.886
and the noise was just...

08:40.888 --> 08:41.952
Well, I slept here.

08:41.988 --> 08:43.120
Guarded the store with my life.

08:43.155 --> 08:44.822
Don't worry, I don't smell.

08:44.857 --> 08:46.489
Took a whore's bath in
the ladies' room this morning.

08:46.525 --> 08:48.190
Just the major stink zones.

08:48.226 --> 08:50.292
You know, armpits, posterior, vag.

08:50.328 --> 08:52.529
That's, uh, in the front
in case you're a homosexual.

08:52.564 --> 08:54.296
Yeah, I know where all
the parts are, thank you.

08:54.332 --> 08:55.832
Oh, okay. Anyway, just showing you

08:55.867 --> 08:57.567
what I bring to the table
as Assistant Manager.

08:57.636 --> 08:59.135
And I'm gonna break the strike.

08:59.170 --> 09:01.571
Mm, I'm not asking you to do that.

09:01.640 --> 09:02.971
I got it.

09:03.007 --> 09:04.172
You can't ask me.

09:04.207 --> 09:06.008
Don't worry, 'cause you just did.

09:06.043 --> 09:07.475
Just tell me what to do.

09:07.511 --> 09:09.511
I mean, we've got baseball
bats, fire hoses.

09:09.547 --> 09:10.846
I mean, it's the first time for me,

09:10.881 --> 09:11.880
so if you take the lead...

09:11.916 --> 09:12.473
Okay, no.

09:12.474 --> 09:13.707
So we just want to end this peacefully.

09:13.776 --> 09:15.810
We don't want to trample
on anybody's civil rights.

09:15.845 --> 09:18.980
Ooh, but that... that
sounds so good to me.

09:19.396 --> 09:20.928
Boycott Cloud 9!

09:20.997 --> 09:23.097
- Who is that?
- I don't know.

09:23.156 --> 09:25.716
I mean, I Tweeted out #ProtestCloud9,

09:25.742 --> 09:28.408
and I guess just all these
people showed up to support us.

09:28.444 --> 09:30.778
Not to brag, but I have,
like, 1,500 followers,

09:30.847 --> 09:32.412
and then they inevitably retweet,

09:32.448 --> 09:34.849
and so it's essentially
like community organizing,

09:34.884 --> 09:37.383
which is actually how
Obama got started...

09:37.418 --> 09:39.185
Boycott Cloud 9!

09:39.221 --> 09:40.692
Excuse me.

09:40.693 --> 09:42.392
I know this looks like Coachella,

09:42.428 --> 09:44.095
but if you were waiting
for the bands to start playing,

09:44.130 --> 09:46.124
you're gonna be sorely disappointed.

09:46.125 --> 09:47.391
I'm actually here to support.

09:47.460 --> 09:49.059
You know, if anyone's
gonna protest a big-box store,

09:49.127 --> 09:50.318
I'm there.

09:50.319 --> 09:52.253
Oh, okay, well, I guess
it's cool to have hobbies.

09:52.867 --> 09:54.398
If I wasn't here, I'd just be at home

09:54.434 --> 09:55.590
shooting Hellspawn.

09:55.591 --> 09:57.098
I'm sorry, that's a reference to...

09:57.099 --> 09:58.098
"Dead Chaser 4."

09:58.133 --> 09:59.633
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I know.

09:59.669 --> 10:01.669
I mean, how much better
is it than "Dead Chaser 3"?

10:01.737 --> 10:03.637
I mean, now when
you shoot people in the head...

10:03.673 --> 10:05.972
Their brains come out.

10:06.008 --> 10:07.908
Well, I'm having a good day.

10:07.943 --> 10:10.410
I am having a very good day.

10:10.445 --> 10:12.345
Boycott Cloud 9!

10:12.414 --> 10:14.314
Boycott Cloud 9!

10:14.349 --> 10:16.349
Boycott Cloud 9!

10:16.418 --> 10:18.083
Boycott Cloud 9.

10:18.119 --> 10:20.853
Boycott Cloud 9. Boycott Cloud 9.

10:25.193 --> 10:27.659
Here, let me help you out with that.

10:27.695 --> 10:28.694
Thank you.

10:28.762 --> 10:30.962
Oh, almost done with this display.

10:30.997 --> 10:33.031
- Nice work.
- Thank you.

10:33.099 --> 10:36.673
It's Mateo Fernando
Aquino Liwanag on the job.

10:36.674 --> 10:38.741
Not like those sons of bitches outside.

10:38.776 --> 10:40.576
Here, take this.

10:42.113 --> 10:43.912
Please disperse.

10:43.948 --> 10:46.681
I have been authorized
to break this strike,

10:46.750 --> 10:47.915
and I will hose you.

10:50.954 --> 10:52.268
You've been warned.

10:53.368 --> 10:55.468
No, no.

10:55.799 --> 10:56.840
Okay.

10:56.841 --> 10:58.073
Oh, come on.

10:58.108 --> 10:59.441
Oh, that looks refreshing.

10:59.477 --> 11:02.242
No, no, no!

11:02.278 --> 11:03.845
Look, a rainbow!

11:03.913 --> 11:07.247
Why isn't there a setting
that hurts people?

11:17.993 --> 11:19.960
Hey, how's the rat coming?

11:19.995 --> 11:21.094
The blower's plugged in.

11:21.129 --> 11:23.029
I just gotta hook it up to the valve.

11:23.098 --> 11:24.831
- Is this the valve?
- I don't know.

11:24.867 --> 11:25.966
Look, can you just hurry up?

11:26.001 --> 11:27.266
Because the news just got here,

11:27.302 --> 11:29.035
and I really want us
to look professional.

11:29.104 --> 11:30.837
- Uh, hey, Dougie!
- Huh?

11:30.873 --> 11:32.839
I'm gonna have you
wait in your car, okay?

11:32.875 --> 11:34.273
Great idea. I'm not gonna let you down.

11:34.309 --> 11:36.809
- Thanks, bud.
- All right? Okay.

11:36.844 --> 11:38.477
Boycott Cloud 9!

11:38.513 --> 11:40.813
Boycott Cloud 9!

11:40.848 --> 11:43.348
I'm Mo Frank, reporting
live from the Cloud 9

11:43.384 --> 11:44.984
on Ozark Highlands Road

11:45.019 --> 11:46.986
where things are anything but heavenly.

11:47.558 --> 11:49.226
We're here with Amy "Dub-anowski,"

11:49.226 --> 11:50.292
- who is one of...
- "Doob-anowski."

11:50.327 --> 11:51.826
- I'm sorry?
- "Doob-anowski."

11:51.861 --> 11:54.628
Amy "Doob-anowski," who is
the organizer of this protest.

11:54.664 --> 11:56.397
Amy, uh, what's this about?

11:56.465 --> 11:58.166
Thank you, Mo.

11:58.201 --> 12:00.034
Well, we are Cloud 9 employees,

12:00.070 --> 12:03.233
and we are asking people
to boycott the store.

12:03.234 --> 12:06.135
Really, what it comes down to,
what this is all about is...

12:06.203 --> 12:07.770
Making sure that transgender people

12:07.806 --> 12:09.871
should not be allowed
in a women's bathroom!

12:09.907 --> 12:11.306
What?

12:11.374 --> 12:13.041
- No, that's not at all...

12:13.076 --> 12:15.477
So, Amy Dubanowski,
why is restricting trans rights

12:15.546 --> 12:17.245
- so important to you?
- No, it's... it's not.

12:17.280 --> 12:18.947
I'm sorry, there's been
a misunderstanding.

12:18.982 --> 12:21.049
I Tweeted out to my 1,506 followers,

12:21.084 --> 12:22.383
and I should have been more clear

12:22.419 --> 12:24.285
that we're just protesting our thing.

12:24.321 --> 12:25.553
Down with the government!

12:25.588 --> 12:26.987
Statehood for Puerto Rico!

12:27.056 --> 12:28.388
- No! No!
- Okay.

12:28.424 --> 12:30.290
This is about workers' rights.

12:30.326 --> 12:31.744
Workers' rights.

12:31.744 --> 12:34.210
We're asking customers
to boycott the store

12:34.246 --> 12:38.081
because this company is a rat, okay?

12:38.116 --> 12:41.718
It is a dirty, filthy rat!

12:43.254 --> 12:45.988
- Oh, it's adorable.
- It's so cute.

12:47.659 --> 12:49.258
I believe that's actually a teddy bear.

12:49.301 --> 12:52.134
Yeah, Mo, I can see
that it's a teddy bear.

12:52.881 --> 12:56.141
I ordered a rat, but there was
a mix-up at the rental house.

12:56.220 --> 12:58.187
We got the teddy bear,
and I guess there's a

12:58.221 --> 12:59.553
a five-year-old in Crestwood

12:59.589 --> 13:00.957
having a horrifying birthday party.

13:00.957 --> 13:02.924
Well, they're having
a better day than we are.

13:02.959 --> 13:04.291
Look, I want you to know that

13:04.327 --> 13:06.895
not all Christians are bigots, okay?

13:06.930 --> 13:08.129
That one is. That's Maggie.

13:08.164 --> 13:10.064
She goes to my church.

13:10.099 --> 13:11.165
She thinks she's so great

13:11.234 --> 13:13.100
because she has a karaoke machine.

13:13.136 --> 13:15.469
Garrett, isn't that the girl
you were talking to?

13:15.505 --> 13:17.471
Eh, I knew there had to be a catch.

13:17.507 --> 13:19.439
I just thought it'd be
something I could live with,

13:19.474 --> 13:21.867
like she's just real
stupid or something.

13:21.867 --> 13:23.166
Please disperse!

13:23.201 --> 13:25.167
This is your final warning.

13:25.203 --> 13:27.770
You're gonna turn
a pressure washer on us?

13:27.805 --> 13:29.205
Yeah, that could legit kill somebody.

13:29.274 --> 13:30.940
Yeah, that's why it's a deterrent.

13:30.975 --> 13:32.041
Whoa, whoa, oh!

13:32.110 --> 13:34.009
That's my new car!

13:34.045 --> 13:35.009
What are you doing?

13:35.045 --> 13:36.345
- Turn it off!
- I'm trying.

13:36.380 --> 13:38.213
Why are you doing this?

13:42.353 --> 13:45.012
I...think I've made my point.

13:56.844 --> 13:59.296
It feels like no matter
what we do out here,

13:59.296 --> 14:01.876
people are still in there
buying stuff like normal.

14:03.334 --> 14:06.301
Then maybe we need to go inside

14:06.337 --> 14:08.437
and stop them from buying stuff.

14:12.876 --> 14:14.209
- You... you need to explain...
- Yeah.

14:14.244 --> 14:16.377
- I was going to explain more.
- Okay.

14:30.038 --> 14:32.038
Attention Cloud 9 shoppers.

14:32.073 --> 14:35.575
The spider infestation in
produce has been 80% contained.

14:35.831 --> 14:37.564
So we will be focusing our attention

14:37.599 --> 14:40.901
on the bedbug infestation
in the mattress section.

14:40.936 --> 14:43.270
Meanwhile, we are down
to only one raccoon

14:43.270 --> 14:44.536
left in the store.

14:44.572 --> 14:46.939
Unfortunately, that raccoon
has grown powerful

14:46.974 --> 14:48.974
beyond our wildest fears.

14:59.286 --> 15:01.085
Don't buy that.

15:01.120 --> 15:05.222
Mm, these have all the
luxury of Egyptian cotton

15:05.257 --> 15:08.626
at half the price.

15:16.902 --> 15:18.067
What a mess!

15:18.103 --> 15:20.436
I'm taking my business to Target.

15:22.674 --> 15:26.476
I'm sorry, Dennis.
It's just 'cause of the strike.

15:26.512 --> 15:27.644
Excuse me!

15:27.679 --> 15:30.981
Support our strike
by boycotting Cloud 9.

15:31.016 --> 15:32.516
Don't give your money to a company

15:32.584 --> 15:34.416
that mistreats its employees.

15:34.451 --> 15:35.951
I don't know about youse guys,

15:35.987 --> 15:38.663
but this broad's making
some good sense, huh?

15:40.600 --> 15:42.933
Boycott Cloud 9!

15:45.596 --> 15:48.030
Thank you! People power!

15:48.098 --> 15:50.265
Power to the people!

15:50.300 --> 15:52.995
- That was great.
- Good job, everybody.

15:53.021 --> 15:55.188
- We did it, guys.
- That was really good.

15:55.230 --> 15:58.131
- Great job.
- Who are they?

15:58.159 --> 15:59.064
Oh, I know those dudes.

15:59.065 --> 16:00.231
They're from the Kirkwood branch.

16:00.266 --> 16:01.499
Oh, my God, it's spreading.

16:01.534 --> 16:03.167
- Tight.
- Hey!

16:03.203 --> 16:04.936
- Thank you!
- Welcome!

16:05.005 --> 16:07.605
- Thank you for your support.
- Where are they going?

16:07.673 --> 16:09.406
Thanks again for coming, guys.
Appreciate it.

16:09.441 --> 16:11.408
- Hey, there he is, all right.
- Thanks a lot.

16:11.443 --> 16:12.610
They're not here to join us.

16:12.678 --> 16:15.345
They're here to replace us.

16:15.380 --> 16:17.414
Then why did they high-five us?

16:17.449 --> 16:20.417
- It's reflexive.
- Hmm?

16:20.452 --> 16:22.419
Oh, yeah.

16:23.408 --> 16:25.475
Okay, everybody, listen up, please.

16:25.476 --> 16:27.104
Corporate doesn't want
anyone to loose their jobs.

16:27.130 --> 16:28.963
They just want things the way they were.

16:29.320 --> 16:31.380
Dina is back as Assistant Manager.

16:31.429 --> 16:32.690
It is both an honor

16:32.690 --> 16:34.466
and a privilege to be able...

16:35.022 --> 16:36.258
And anybody who's willing

16:36.259 --> 16:37.625
to come in and sign the letter

16:37.660 --> 16:40.294
by the end of the day,
we welcome you back.

16:40.329 --> 16:42.296
Glenn, that goes for you too.

16:42.331 --> 16:44.164
But I'm Glenn.

16:44.233 --> 16:46.333
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:46.402 --> 16:49.335
Oh, he just has an air
of authority about him.

16:49.404 --> 16:51.471
Anyway, if that's something
you feel you can't do,

16:51.506 --> 16:54.608
I understand, and I wish you well.

16:54.643 --> 16:57.077
Okay.

16:57.112 --> 16:58.478
- Wait.
- Hey.

16:58.513 --> 16:59.895
No, no, hey, guys.

16:59.896 --> 17:01.863
They're not really gonna replace us!

17:01.898 --> 17:03.130
What are they gonna do,

17:03.199 --> 17:05.598
find someone who stocks
go-backs like Mateo

17:05.634 --> 17:08.602
or who works the cash
register like Elias?

17:08.637 --> 17:09.935
Yes.

17:09.971 --> 17:13.306
Those are both very easy things to do.

17:16.444 --> 17:18.278
Scab!

17:18.313 --> 17:20.380
Hey, Nik-Nik-Nikki.

17:20.415 --> 17:23.549
I had a quick just, like,
silly question for you.

17:23.584 --> 17:26.452
Uh, how serious are you about all this

17:26.487 --> 17:29.382
- sort of trans bathroom stuff?
- What do you mean?

17:29.408 --> 17:31.675
I mean, like, is it
the only thing you think about

17:31.744 --> 17:33.844
or is it more like one of those

17:33.913 --> 17:36.313
barely talk about it,
just how you were raised,

17:36.348 --> 17:38.181
opinion could change
if you surrounded yourself

17:38.250 --> 17:40.521
with a cooler, more diverse
group of friends type deals?

17:40.522 --> 17:41.887
No, I think it's pretty simple.

17:41.922 --> 17:43.322
I mean, you're born a gender.

17:43.358 --> 17:45.324
I think it's unnatural
to try and change that.

17:45.360 --> 17:47.226
That's what I was afraid of. Hey...

17:47.261 --> 17:48.494
Think about it this way.

17:48.529 --> 17:50.095
Your brain doesn't make you a woman.

17:50.164 --> 17:51.597
Breasts make you a woman.

17:51.666 --> 17:55.433
You know, these make you a woman.

17:55.502 --> 17:58.069
You're not gonna make this
easy on me, are you?

18:06.482 --> 18:08.432
Boycott Cloud 9!

18:08.573 --> 18:10.582
Boycott... I see you, Andre!

18:11.951 --> 18:14.050
Sandra, what are you doing?

18:14.086 --> 18:15.285
Sandra!

18:15.354 --> 18:17.954
Come back to work, Sandra.

18:18.023 --> 18:19.923
Sandra, no, no.

18:19.958 --> 18:22.459
Come here, Sandra. Sandra, come here.

18:22.528 --> 18:24.461
- Sandra, no, stay.
- Come here, come here.

18:24.530 --> 18:26.029
- Sandra, Sandra, stay.
- Sandra, come here!

18:26.064 --> 18:27.130
Come back. Come on, girl.

18:27.199 --> 18:28.432
Come here, Sandra. Come on!

18:28.467 --> 18:30.299
No, Sandra. Sandra,
Sandra, Sandra, stay.

18:30.368 --> 18:31.367
Sandra, come back. Come here, baby.

18:31.403 --> 18:32.435
Come on. Come on, girl.

18:32.470 --> 18:33.569
- Come on!
- Sandra, stay!

18:33.605 --> 18:35.971
- Sandra, no!
- Good girl.

18:36.040 --> 18:38.007
Bad Sandra!

18:41.245 --> 18:43.546
You sure it's okay if I go back?

18:43.581 --> 18:45.080
Yep.

18:45.116 --> 18:47.248
You stuck it out as long as you could.

18:47.284 --> 18:48.483
You're one of the good ones.

18:48.552 --> 18:51.887
Yeah, it was tough, but principles.

18:53.390 --> 18:54.956
Hey, dude, I'm bouncing.

18:55.426 --> 18:56.759
You're gonna go out with that girl?

18:56.843 --> 18:58.022
Isn't she kind of a bigot?

18:58.022 --> 18:59.489
Okay, dude, I'm the black guy
in a wheelchair.

18:59.524 --> 19:00.957
I'll decide who the bigots are.

19:00.992 --> 19:02.525
Oh, no, you're right. I'm sorry.

19:02.594 --> 19:05.494
And this girl is a bigot,
but I have a plan.

19:05.529 --> 19:07.028
I'm gonna take her out to dinner.

19:07.097 --> 19:08.497
Then I'm gonna have sex with her.

19:08.532 --> 19:09.965
A couple times.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.366
Possibly six.

19:12.088 --> 19:13.259
But then when she asks for more,

19:13.285 --> 19:14.618
- I'm gonna say no.
- Ah.

19:14.688 --> 19:15.754
Not unless she takes a look

19:15.789 --> 19:16.888
at who she is as a person

19:16.924 --> 19:18.623
and makes some serious changes.

19:18.692 --> 19:20.758
Well, that will show her.

19:20.793 --> 19:22.893
I'm just trying to make
the world a better place, Dude.

19:22.929 --> 19:24.628
Thank you so much for your service.

19:24.697 --> 19:27.798
This is what Martin
Luther King would do.

19:29.535 --> 19:32.402
Let's go, girl! Ha ha!

19:33.906 --> 19:37.907
Thank you guys so much
for getting me my job back.

19:52.557 --> 19:54.823
You don't have to stay
out here, you know?

19:54.892 --> 19:57.177
Oh, no, I'm staying out
as long as you do.

19:58.963 --> 20:01.990
Which is when, do you think?

20:03.801 --> 20:06.501
I don't know. Maybe forever.

20:06.570 --> 20:08.403
Cool.

20:10.486 --> 20:12.218
It's just that as soon
as we put these signs down

20:12.441 --> 20:13.775
it's all over.

20:13.810 --> 20:15.843
All of it. Like it never happened.

20:16.462 --> 20:17.811
Just back to square one.

20:17.811 --> 20:21.947
Everything's gonna be back
to the way it used to be.

20:21.981 --> 20:23.781
Except for that garden shed.

20:23.816 --> 20:25.549
That's never gonna be the same.

20:25.584 --> 20:27.551
You know, just because we go inside

20:27.586 --> 20:28.814
doesn't mean it's over.

20:30.923 --> 20:33.990
The fight'll go on. This
was just the first punch.

20:35.894 --> 20:37.064
So...

20:39.898 --> 20:43.666
to be continued?

20:43.735 --> 20:45.668
To be continued.

20:54.611 --> 20:56.979
I'm exhausted.

20:57.014 --> 20:59.448
It's hard work not working.

20:59.483 --> 21:02.151
Yeah.

21:02.186 --> 21:03.701
My feet hurt.

21:03.701 --> 21:05.768
Well, we have been on
strike for two full days.

21:05.803 --> 21:06.902
One day.

21:06.938 --> 21:08.804
Mmm, agree to disagree.

21:08.873 --> 21:11.540
I don't agree. You're wrong.
