01:16.520 --> 01:18.909
We'll be right back
with our winning lottery numbers.

01:19.120 --> 01:22.999
Don't forget, this week's
jackpot is up to $32 million.

01:23.960 --> 01:26.599
Oh, $32 million.

01:26.800 --> 01:28.233
Boy, that's a lot of money...

01:28.440 --> 01:31.113
...even split three ways.

01:33.160 --> 01:34.878
Aren't we forgetting someone?

01:35.080 --> 01:37.071
Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed.

01:37.280 --> 01:38.872
I mean four ways.

01:39.080 --> 01:41.640
Of course we'll give some to Buck.

01:43.720 --> 01:45.631
I know what I'm gonna do with mine.

01:45.840 --> 01:48.229
I'm gonna share mine
with the poor and unfortunate.

01:48.440 --> 01:50.954
Yup, the poor unfortunate babes...

01:51.160 --> 01:55.199
...who haven't yet experienced
waking up with a Bud in their hands.

01:57.120 --> 01:59.395
Well, at least you have.

02:01.040 --> 02:03.998
Besides, I don't think
you deserve a full share.

02:04.200 --> 02:08.478
I mean, after all, you were
left on our doorstep by trolls.

02:08.960 --> 02:11.428
At least when I was born,
and the doctor spanked me...

02:11.640 --> 02:13.358
...I cried instead of saying "Thanks.

02:13.560 --> 02:15.198
I like it rough."

02:16.320 --> 02:18.993
Mom, did I talk
to the doctor when I was born?

02:19.640 --> 02:21.517
Of course not, honey.

02:21.720 --> 02:24.109
You didn't learn to talk
until you were 10.

02:27.440 --> 02:29.715
Now, kids, I want you
to be nice to each other.

02:29.920 --> 02:32.912
I'm not always gonna
be around, you know...

02:33.160 --> 02:35.674
...especially if these
numbers come up.

02:36.560 --> 02:39.757
They're flashing the numbers,
they're flashing. Read them, read them!

02:39.960 --> 02:41.188
Okay.

02:41.400 --> 02:42.958
- We got a seven.
- Yeah.

02:43.160 --> 02:44.513
- Sixteen.
- Yeah.

02:44.720 --> 02:45.948
- Eighteen.
- Yeah.

02:46.160 --> 02:47.479
- Twenty-two.
- Yeah.

02:47.680 --> 02:49.716
- Twenty-eight. And 34.
- Yeah.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.319
How many did we get?

02:51.520 --> 02:52.919
None.

02:53.640 --> 02:56.518
God, nothing for 12 weeks in a row.

02:56.720 --> 02:58.756
Is that some kind
of a record, Mom?

03:01.560 --> 03:03.596
Not for me.

03:15.720 --> 03:17.676
My child.

03:18.080 --> 03:20.116
My child.

03:20.440 --> 03:22.351
My God.

03:25.240 --> 03:28.755
Al, this is the third day in a row
you've come home happy.

03:28.960 --> 03:32.032
Now, I just had a physical,
and I'm fine.

03:32.240 --> 03:35.118
So, what are you so happy about?

03:35.360 --> 03:38.591
What if I said that I've come
to grips with my job...

03:38.800 --> 03:40.597
...and I've come to appreciate...

03:40.800 --> 03:42.870
...what the three
of you mean to my life?

03:43.120 --> 03:46.430
- We'd say you were lying.
- And you'd be right.

03:48.040 --> 03:50.235
Al, spit it out. What is it?

03:50.480 --> 03:53.199
All right. I guess it can't
do any harm to tell you.

03:53.720 --> 03:56.109
A pretty girl has come
into the store every day...

03:56.320 --> 03:58.072
...and flirted with me.

03:59.920 --> 04:01.433
I think she likes me.

04:05.320 --> 04:07.231
I'm not kidding.
She's a shoe groupie.

04:07.480 --> 04:08.993
- Shoe groupie!
- Shoe groupie!

04:09.240 --> 04:10.753
What's so funny about that?

04:11.120 --> 04:14.351
Nothing, Dad. A lot of people think
rock stars get the best groupies...

04:14.560 --> 04:19.428
...but now it's clear. Nothing gets them
antsy like a shoehorn in your "pantsy."

04:20.040 --> 04:22.110
That's funny, Mom.

04:22.320 --> 04:24.197
What's wrong, Mom?

04:24.600 --> 04:27.068
Your father's cheating on me.

04:28.760 --> 04:30.751
I am not.

04:30.960 --> 04:32.313
I know you are.

04:32.520 --> 04:36.274
You waited until I was a tad
over 30 and you cheated on me.

04:37.160 --> 04:38.593
I have two things to tell you.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.756
I would never cheat on you.

04:40.960 --> 04:44.111
And if you think
you're just a tad over 30...

04:44.880 --> 04:48.236
...then I was just a tad
drunk at our wedding.

04:51.560 --> 04:53.198
Oh, all right, if it bothers you...

04:53.400 --> 04:56.233
...I won't mention my groupie.
It's no big deal.

05:03.880 --> 05:05.438
Yes!

05:07.200 --> 05:08.872
Kids, I have to know the truth.

05:09.080 --> 05:12.231
I also have to go to the bathroom,
so I'll make this quick.

05:12.440 --> 05:15.113
I want you to break into the shoe
store tomorrow morning...

05:15.320 --> 05:17.834
...and spy on everything
your father does.

05:18.240 --> 05:21.630
Okay, we'll do it, Mom, but I'm
telling you, he is not cheating on you.

05:23.080 --> 05:24.479
What's that sound?

05:25.120 --> 05:26.712
Oh, my God.

05:26.920 --> 05:28.638
It's the shower.

05:31.800 --> 05:33.631
He's bathing.

05:34.320 --> 05:36.231
She's lost him.

05:42.840 --> 05:44.398
Isn't there a better place to hide?

05:44.600 --> 05:47.433
I mean, he has to come here
every time he sells a shoe.

05:51.920 --> 05:53.035
Sorry.

05:55.360 --> 05:56.998
Well, this should be interesting.

05:57.200 --> 05:59.953
I always wondered
what Dad does all day.

06:10.440 --> 06:12.715
Open for business.

06:28.400 --> 06:31.676
Quite an advertisement
for college, eh, Kel?

06:33.840 --> 06:35.558
What do you mean?

06:41.840 --> 06:44.195
God, he hasn't moved.

06:46.200 --> 06:49.237
Three dollars
and twenty-five cents an hour.

06:50.200 --> 06:52.555
How can they afford to pay him?

06:53.920 --> 06:55.797
Oh, wait, I think he's moving.

07:16.760 --> 07:18.955
All aboard!

07:33.760 --> 07:35.876
- It's the groupie!
- It's the groupie!

07:37.120 --> 07:38.838
Sir.

07:39.040 --> 07:40.917
Take a number.

07:44.920 --> 07:47.195
What is your number?

07:47.520 --> 07:49.112
One.

07:51.880 --> 07:55.031
- How may I serve you?
- I want my money back.

07:55.240 --> 08:00.917
These shoes you sold me are as
useless to me as a comb is to you.

08:01.160 --> 08:05.711
I've only worn them once
and they split at the sides.

08:08.200 --> 08:10.760
Let me explain.
See, it's just like an elevator.

08:10.960 --> 08:14.032
There's a two-ton weight limit
on these shoes.

08:20.360 --> 08:24.478
What say I nail the soles
directly to your feet?

08:24.920 --> 08:29.038
It'll give you more traction
when you're pulling the ice wagon.

08:30.120 --> 08:32.190
You'll be hearing from my attorney.

08:32.440 --> 08:35.398
Is that the law offices
of Haagen and Dazs?

08:41.159 --> 08:43.116
Serving number two.

08:43.320 --> 08:45.151
Number two?

08:45.360 --> 08:47.157
Oh, God.

08:48.680 --> 08:51.399
Well, Kel, I think
we can go home now.

08:51.600 --> 08:54.512
The only person Dad's
cheating on Mom with is death.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.754
Excuse me,
but that must be my dinner.

09:07.120 --> 09:09.350
Easy now, Hoppity.

09:10.280 --> 09:13.272
She's not Buck. She'll run away.

09:15.880 --> 09:19.555
You're looking handsome today, Al.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.958
I brought you some muffins.

09:31.360 --> 09:33.351
As pretty as you are.

09:34.600 --> 09:39.310
God, it is disgusting what a woman
in a short skirt can do to a man.

09:46.080 --> 09:49.311
Could you show me something
in a four-inch heel?

09:50.000 --> 09:51.274
I can.

10:06.720 --> 10:08.472
Hey, now.

10:08.680 --> 10:12.275
Now, how does that feel?

10:12.600 --> 10:14.750
Like heaven.

10:15.920 --> 10:19.390
I love to see a man on all fours.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.719
You know, I've felt a lot
of hands on my feet...

10:22.920 --> 10:25.514
...but yours are so strong...

10:25.720 --> 10:27.438
...yet so yielding.

10:27.920 --> 10:30.514
That's high school football.
When I was on the team...

10:30.720 --> 10:33.314
...and the play called for
a strong but yielding hand...

10:33.560 --> 10:37.951
I don't want to hear about football.
Tell me something exciting.

10:38.160 --> 10:41.709
Tell me about selling shoes.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.515
I remember a cold day, winter of '68.

10:46.720 --> 10:49.314
I was just a young heel then.

10:50.880 --> 10:53.553
Don't stop, baby.

10:55.240 --> 10:56.912
You know, Bud...

10:57.120 --> 10:59.839
...she just may be the shoe groupie.

11:03.840 --> 11:07.594
You're gonna make some guy
a fine end table one day, Kelly.

11:09.640 --> 11:13.599
I looked her right in the foot and said:
"I don't need no stinking shoe-sizer.

11:13.800 --> 11:16.314
You're a size seven, baby."

11:17.240 --> 11:21.472
- Oh, God.
- Yes, I know. I know.

11:21.720 --> 11:25.190
Bud, we've got a real problem.
How do we tell Mom?

11:25.400 --> 11:27.675
And do we tell Mom?

11:42.200 --> 11:43.633
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, Mom.

11:43.880 --> 11:46.235
Well, what'd you find?
What'd you find?

11:47.160 --> 11:49.958
Let's see. She deserves to know.

11:50.160 --> 11:51.957
But then she'll be mad at Dad.

11:52.160 --> 11:53.639
And she'll be hurt.

11:53.840 --> 11:56.798
Do I betray Dad without
hearing his side of the story?

11:57.000 --> 11:58.353
What a dilemma.

11:58.560 --> 12:00.835
I wonder what Kelly's thinking.

12:01.840 --> 12:05.196
Eenie-meenie chili beanie
The spirits are about to speak

12:12.720 --> 12:15.678
Are they friendly spirits, Bullwinkle?

12:20.440 --> 12:23.238
Well, kids, did you find anything?

12:24.680 --> 12:28.559
Well, he sat there for hours.
He went to the bathroom.

12:28.760 --> 12:31.433
He looked at his watch,
and he insulted a fat woman.

12:32.200 --> 12:35.317
Oh, and don't forget the pretty
woman who was all over him.

12:37.360 --> 12:40.830
Oh, yeah. And that.
But nothing happened.

12:41.040 --> 12:43.315
Yeah, they didn't
have intercourse or anything.

12:45.360 --> 12:49.672
Just tickled her feet and
ate her muffins and she left.

12:55.040 --> 12:56.553
Oh, my God.

12:56.760 --> 12:58.318
It's not just sex?

12:58.520 --> 13:01.193
He's eating with her too?

13:01.440 --> 13:03.237
Don't worry, Mom. It's nothing.

13:03.440 --> 13:06.910
I mean, Bud's done more
with a girl. Bud.

13:09.320 --> 13:10.833
What'd she look like, Kelly?

13:11.080 --> 13:12.638
- Well, she's...
- Well, wait a second.

13:12.840 --> 13:14.910
Put this groupie thing
aside for a second.

13:15.640 --> 13:17.870
You know damn well
I've had more women...

13:22.360 --> 13:26.273
Al, you can forget about
having sex with me ever again.

13:26.800 --> 13:28.472
I already did.

13:34.560 --> 13:36.232
What'd I do?

13:36.720 --> 13:40.269
You were seen eating
the muffins of your mistress.

13:41.280 --> 13:43.430
I think it's time for us
to get out of here.

13:43.640 --> 13:45.676
No, seriously,
I've had plenty of babes.

13:45.880 --> 13:49.634
Yeah, you just don't see them because
I like to keep my sex to myself.

13:50.120 --> 13:51.599
And you're doing a good job.

13:51.800 --> 13:54.030
No one's guessed
what your sex is yet.

13:56.160 --> 13:58.310
Well, Al, you wanna
explain yourself?

13:58.560 --> 14:03.076
Well, I left high school and lost
the will to live. And here I am.

14:05.560 --> 14:07.357
What are we talking about?

14:07.560 --> 14:10.677
You cheated on me
with that shoe groupie.

14:10.880 --> 14:12.996
Oh, is that what this is all about?

14:13.200 --> 14:14.838
I never touched her.

14:15.040 --> 14:16.758
Look, she likes me.

14:16.960 --> 14:20.396
I can't help that.
I can't hide what I've got.

14:20.800 --> 14:24.998
It's not my fault if my butt
has the classic shoe-man shape.

14:25.240 --> 14:27.879
Moulded from years
of getting down, getting up...

14:28.080 --> 14:32.790
...getting down, until it's the firm
round apple you see before you.

14:33.520 --> 14:36.557
You may as well blame
the bird for flying.

14:37.680 --> 14:39.193
We've heard all about it.

14:39.400 --> 14:43.393
If anyone wants to talk, you know
that I can be a calm and objective ear.

14:43.640 --> 14:46.200
- Well, I'd like to say some...
- Out of my way, pig.

14:46.480 --> 14:48.516
I know these must be
trying times for you.

14:48.720 --> 14:51.712
Come tell me everything.
I can be a good shoulder to cry on.

14:51.920 --> 14:54.753
- Oh, Marcie, I'm so upset.
- Into the mike, hon.

14:54.960 --> 14:57.952
The girls at the beauty parlour
have a right to know.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.877
I feel so betrayed.

15:01.080 --> 15:03.230
Am I speaking loud enough?

15:03.480 --> 15:06.358
Al, I just want you to know
that I'm not prejudging you.

15:06.560 --> 15:08.437
- Well, thanks, buddy.
- So how was she?

15:08.640 --> 15:09.959
I never touched her.

15:10.160 --> 15:13.709
So she did all the work?
God, I love that.

15:15.280 --> 15:16.633
And that's not all.

15:16.840 --> 15:20.799
He ate muffins.
He never eats anything I make.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.753
I tell you, if I'd ever actually
done anything for him...

15:23.960 --> 15:26.554
...I'd be feeling the fool right now.

15:27.520 --> 15:31.672
Hi, Betty. Hi, Mavis.
I'll see you on Tuesday.

15:32.440 --> 15:35.716
Anyhow, I'm hurt. Hurt, I say.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.275
Does anyone wanna
hear my side of this?

15:41.720 --> 15:45.315
No need. You, sir,
are a cheat and a liar.

15:45.800 --> 15:48.189
Now, I have the name
of a woman attorney...

15:48.400 --> 15:50.755
...who will chew Al up
and spit him out.

15:50.960 --> 15:53.349
That's who I would use
to bleach my husband's bones...

15:53.560 --> 15:57.838
...if he even looked at another woman
while he was wearing my brand.

16:00.240 --> 16:02.231
Isn't that right, cinnamon buns?

16:03.280 --> 16:06.272
That would only be fair,
bonbon bottom.

16:08.680 --> 16:11.319
I see now I have to kill her.

16:12.640 --> 16:16.679
All right, that's enough.
Now, I have a little announcement.

16:16.880 --> 16:19.110
Now, I can understand
why you all would think...

16:19.320 --> 16:22.949
...that I was cheating on my wife.
After all, she did bear my children.

16:23.160 --> 16:25.879
Bud and nobody sitting in a tree

16:26.080 --> 16:30.551
K-l... Something, something,
Something, something, T

16:34.120 --> 16:37.032
But I am a man of my word
and I say I did not cheat.

16:37.240 --> 16:39.549
Now I expect apologies
from all of you.

16:39.760 --> 16:41.751
Which one's gonna be first?

16:42.400 --> 16:44.470
Very nice.

16:45.320 --> 16:47.550
If Buck could talk
he'd take my side.

16:47.800 --> 16:51.429
If I could talk, I would have
gotten the Carson job.

16:53.080 --> 16:57.153
May the shoe business take you all.
I shall now take my leave.

17:01.600 --> 17:04.830
And none of you have earned
the right to look at my heinie.

17:08.119 --> 17:10.759
They all think I'm guilty.
I should've done it.

17:10.960 --> 17:13.997
I got a good mind to go back
to the shoe store, eat some muffins...

17:14.200 --> 17:17.875
...and before I fall asleep, give her
the best 30 seconds of her life.

17:19.359 --> 17:22.271
Opportunity never comes
when you want it.

17:29.800 --> 17:31.199
Take me, shoe man.

17:34.200 --> 17:36.316
- How'd you get in here?
- A ladder.

17:36.520 --> 17:39.796
It was hanging
outside your daughter's window.

17:41.120 --> 17:45.910
- Are you wearing anything under there?
- Just a pair of high heels.

17:50.800 --> 17:55.555
Now, look here, miss, I won't...
I won't stand that kind of behaviour.

17:59.600 --> 18:03.798
This is a sex-free house, and by golly,
it will be for the rest of my life.

18:06.240 --> 18:07.559
Talk shoe to me.

18:08.240 --> 18:10.390
It was a warm day in August.

18:10.600 --> 18:13.592
The shoeboxes were throbbing...
No, no, I can't.

18:14.600 --> 18:16.556
I'm married to a woman named...

18:17.560 --> 18:20.518
...something.
You're gonna have to leave.

18:20.760 --> 18:23.228
There's nothing you can do
that'll make me leave.

18:23.480 --> 18:27.678
I don't wanna get tough with you,
miss, but you leave me no choice.

18:28.680 --> 18:32.309
Oh, take off the socks. The socks.

18:35.800 --> 18:40.316
Al, do you have your
shoes off up there?

18:41.600 --> 18:45.991
There are people breathing
down here, for God's sakes.

18:46.240 --> 18:48.595
She doesn't deserve a man like you.

18:48.800 --> 18:51.519
Try me on for size.

18:51.720 --> 18:54.473
Peg! Peg!

18:55.520 --> 18:57.033
Peg!

18:57.920 --> 18:59.558
Peg!

19:00.160 --> 19:01.639
What is it, Al?

19:03.400 --> 19:04.879
Nothing.

19:06.120 --> 19:07.439
Where's Marcie and Jefferson?

19:07.640 --> 19:12.156
In my anger, I let it slip out that
you still cry at the end of Bambi.

19:12.360 --> 19:15.033
They're out spreading the word.

19:15.880 --> 19:18.314
I thought we had a trust.

19:18.640 --> 19:21.598
Well, so did I, cheater.

19:21.840 --> 19:23.990
Peg. We have to talk.

19:24.200 --> 19:26.270
Well, I don't know
what we have to talk about.

19:26.480 --> 19:28.596
I can understand those
other times you cheated.

19:29.240 --> 19:34.075
That 10-cents-a-week raise you
pocketed for yourself back in '72.

19:35.000 --> 19:39.232
Those M&M's that you had hidden
in the aspirin bottle.

19:39.440 --> 19:42.273
Yup. I know about that.

19:42.480 --> 19:44.311
But this is different, Al.

19:44.520 --> 19:45.873
How could you do this to me...

19:46.080 --> 19:49.277
...especially when you know
how sensitive I am?

19:55.880 --> 19:58.110
Now, listen, Peg.

20:00.160 --> 20:02.628
If I was gonna leave you,
it wouldn't be for a woman.

20:02.960 --> 20:05.599
I don't want another woman.

20:06.640 --> 20:09.074
We might have another TV, though.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.151
You know what I'd really like, one
of those picture-in-a-picture jobs.

20:13.360 --> 20:17.512
Sometimes they got a game on, at
the same time they got a hooter movie.

20:19.160 --> 20:22.470
Flipping back and forth between
the channels makes me kind of...

20:22.800 --> 20:24.358
...anxious.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.433
Oh, well, maybe some other time.

20:26.640 --> 20:32.272
Anyhow, I never have,
nor will I ever cheat on you.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.877
- Really, Al?
- Really, Peg.

20:36.080 --> 20:38.594
But I did have the opportunity.

20:39.240 --> 20:40.468
Well, what stopped you?

20:41.840 --> 20:43.592
I don't know.

20:44.720 --> 20:46.153
Well, I do.

20:46.360 --> 20:48.555
It's because we've been
married for 20 years.

20:48.760 --> 20:50.716
We have 20 years
of the same memories.

20:50.920 --> 20:53.718
Same disappointments.
The same life.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.878
Anyone else would've left us by now.

20:58.120 --> 21:01.157
But we can't, and we never will...

21:01.360 --> 21:05.194
...because you know that we were
meant for each other.

21:06.280 --> 21:09.272
Oh, my God, that is it.

21:10.560 --> 21:13.279
I've never been so depressed.

21:14.400 --> 21:16.709
Oh, Al, you do love me.

21:16.920 --> 21:21.391
- Give me a kiss.
- I've warned you about touching me.

21:22.280 --> 21:24.191
Come on, honey, let's go upstairs.

21:24.400 --> 21:26.072
Oh, why not?

21:26.280 --> 21:28.032
Already hit rock bottom.

21:33.920 --> 21:35.194
What is it, Al?

21:36.320 --> 21:38.038
Can't go upstairs.

21:39.400 --> 21:41.311
Why not?

21:41.920 --> 21:44.718
Because I'm so hot,
I want you here, right now.

21:44.960 --> 21:47.269
Oh, Al.

21:47.680 --> 21:50.399
- Let me just get comfortable.
- All right, Peg.

21:50.600 --> 21:53.478
No, sweetheart, I wanna cuddle first.

21:55.400 --> 21:57.595
Al, honey, tell me something...

21:57.800 --> 21:59.916
...were you ever tempted
by that woman?

22:00.120 --> 22:02.554
You know, even a little bit?

22:10.080 --> 22:11.593
No.

22:13.240 --> 22:17.597
Because you know, at your age,
that was probably your last chance.

22:25.320 --> 22:26.958
I know.
