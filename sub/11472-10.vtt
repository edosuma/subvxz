WEBVTT

00:07.641 --> 00:10.010
Nice muffler!

00:10.043 --> 00:11.712
We should definitely be
getting a ride.

00:11.745 --> 00:13.446
Right here is
the best spot.

00:13.479 --> 00:14.480
This is cool.

00:15.381 --> 00:16.382
Hitchhiking.

00:16.416 --> 00:19.019
It's, like,
in Kerouac, you know?

00:19.052 --> 00:20.654
Kerouac?

00:21.421 --> 00:22.689
Jack Kerouac.

00:22.723 --> 00:24.390
He wrote
<i>On the Road.</i>

00:24.424 --> 00:27.093
Kim, we've been reading
it in English class

00:27.127 --> 00:29.362
for the last two weeks.
Where've you been?

00:29.395 --> 00:31.164
All we ever do
in that class is read.

00:31.197 --> 00:34.067
Ooh! Stick out
your thumb, would ya?

00:34.100 --> 00:35.969
We're so sheltered,
you know?

00:36.002 --> 00:38.672
There's this whole
other America out there.

00:38.705 --> 00:41.107
And the person
who picks us up
could be an artist

00:41.141 --> 00:44.645
or a psychic
or an escaped felon.

00:44.678 --> 00:45.846
It's so exciting.

00:45.879 --> 00:47.047
Okay, one thing
that helps...

00:47.080 --> 00:49.415
Point your boobs
towards the road.

00:53.419 --> 00:54.588
Redneck!

00:56.222 --> 00:57.691
Oops... I mean...

00:57.724 --> 00:59.225
Cool guy.
Come on!

01:05.165 --> 01:07.200
Hey. Drop us as close
to the corner

01:07.233 --> 01:09.536
of Wilson and Elm
as you can.

01:13.574 --> 01:15.041
Hi, I'm Lindsay.

01:15.075 --> 01:16.276
This is Kim.

01:18.011 --> 01:20.781
So, are you from
around these parts?

01:20.814 --> 01:22.683
1210 Lilac Terrace.

01:23.717 --> 01:25.118
Oh.

01:25.719 --> 01:26.787
So what do you do?

01:31.357 --> 01:33.493
You pick up
hitchhikers a lot?

01:41.167 --> 01:42.869
Listen, I know you.

01:42.903 --> 01:44.437
I buy gear from
your dad's store.

01:44.470 --> 01:46.206
I don't think you girls
should be doin' this,

01:46.239 --> 01:48.642

to tell him what you're up to.

let her hitchhike?

03:17.698 --> 03:18.965
Oh, I don't know.

03:18.999 --> 03:21.001
I bet she doesn't
even have parents.

03:21.034 --> 03:23.103
Of course she does,

03:23.136 --> 03:25.238

to her mom on the phone.

03:25.271 --> 03:26.740

meet her.

Oh, not exactly.

My parents wanna
meet your mom.

What?

06:11.572 --> 06:13.473
Yeah, they wanna
get to know her.

Shut up.

No, I'm serious.

quiet, please?

06:20.413 --> 06:21.515

06:21.548 --> 06:25.519

in a classroom.

They don't know.

07:14.668 --> 07:17.170
Maybe I'm unbelievably good.

gonna find out?

07:18.471 --> 07:19.973

Mr. Crisp?

<i>Not good. I want to give you</i>

08:42.355 --> 08:43.757
<i>I think</i>
<i>it's very unfair</i>

08:43.790 --> 08:46.593
the way you've been
running baseball in gym class.

08:46.627 --> 08:49.930
<i>You always let</i>
<i>the jock kids run the game.</i>

08:49.963 --> 08:53.333
Now, some kids
like Gordon, my son,

08:53.366 --> 08:54.868
never... Never
get a chance

08:54.901 --> 08:57.003
'cause you guys
think he's not very good.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.972
<i>For example,</i>
<i>he may wanna play shortstop,</i>

08:59.005 --> 09:02.242
<i>but, uh, yeah,</i>
<i>you never give him a shot.</i>

09:02.275 --> 09:06.012
Look, I'm sorry, but, uh,
you know I always assumed

09:06.046 --> 09:08.649
Gordon, uh, didn't
have any interest in sports.

09:08.682 --> 09:10.851

<i>Well, he does.</i>

<i>Oh, I... I... I, uh,</i>

09:14.588 --> 09:16.089
I apologize.
All right?

09:16.122 --> 09:17.958
I'll rectify
the situation immediately.

09:17.991 --> 09:20.060
<i>Okay, then.</i>
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

09:20.093 --> 09:21.261
<i>Good‐bye now.</i>

09:21.294 --> 09:22.563
All right, bye.

09:23.997 --> 09:25.799
Gordon Crisp!

09:26.533 --> 09:28.134
I did it.
What did he say?

09:29.102 --> 09:30.537
He totally bought it.

09:30.571 --> 09:32.606
He called me
Mr. Crisp and everything.

09:33.473 --> 09:35.776
Fellas, I just
changed our lives.

09:36.276 --> 09:38.044
Oh, great.

09:38.078 --> 09:40.547
Now we're gonna
have to actually
play baseball.

09:40.581 --> 09:42.616
Thanks a lot, Bill.

09:43.349 --> 09:44.685
I can't wait
till tomorrow.

09:49.690 --> 09:51.558
You have such
a lovely house.

09:51.592 --> 09:52.859
Thank you.

09:53.694 --> 09:55.261

house once.

Oh, yeah.

09:56.362 --> 09:57.964

09:57.998 --> 09:59.032
Mm.

09:59.065 --> 10:01.568

left me with two kids,

10:01.602 --> 10:04.170
and a huge mortgage
and, well...

10:04.204 --> 10:05.639
That's life, huh?

10:05.672 --> 10:08.374
JEAN: I can't imagine
how difficult it must be

10:08.408 --> 10:09.676
to raise
children by yourself.

10:09.710 --> 10:11.778
Oh, it isn't easy.

10:13.346 --> 10:16.049
Chip, my oldest,
oh, he's a doll.

10:16.082 --> 10:19.252
He's got water in his brain,
but, oh, he's a sweet kid.

10:19.285 --> 10:22.188
Kim, she's
another story.

10:22.222 --> 10:24.390
Yeah, tell us about Kim.

10:24.424 --> 10:27.060
Well, she ain't
the sharpest crayon
in the box.

10:27.093 --> 10:29.329
She's a big
pain in the neck.

10:30.664 --> 10:32.398
And I know she hates me
for being strict...

10:33.499 --> 10:35.035
I get worried.

10:35.068 --> 10:36.202
Of course you do.

10:36.236 --> 10:38.672
Because I don't know
what she's doin' out there.

10:38.705 --> 10:40.507
She lies.

10:40.541 --> 10:42.643
These girls today,
they all lie.

10:43.343 --> 10:44.511
She says to me...

10:44.545 --> 10:45.612
Mm‐hmm.

10:45.646 --> 10:47.614
"I'm gonna go study
at the library."

10:47.648 --> 10:50.651
She goes to a party.
She gets loaded.

10:50.684 --> 10:53.319
She says she's
seein' a movie...

10:53.353 --> 10:56.222
She's foolin' around with
some guy in the back of a van.

10:57.390 --> 10:58.391
Oh, my.

10:59.359 --> 11:00.561
Want to know
how I find out?

11:00.594 --> 11:01.728
How?

11:01.762 --> 11:03.329
I read her diary.

11:04.731 --> 11:07.333
I sneak into her room,
and I read it.

11:07.367 --> 11:09.069
Oh, she won't
do her homework,

11:09.102 --> 11:11.071
but she's got a freakin'
novel in there.

11:11.538 --> 11:13.106
I have to.

11:13.139 --> 11:14.708
It's the only way
I get the truth.

11:14.741 --> 11:16.577
And you wanna
know somethin'?

11:16.610 --> 11:18.512
The truth is very scary.

11:18.545 --> 11:20.647
Because times
have changed.

11:20.681 --> 11:22.082
These girls today...

11:22.616 --> 11:23.984
Oh, they run wild.

11:30.557 --> 11:32.158
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

11:33.059 --> 11:34.260
Hey.

11:34.294 --> 11:35.428
So how was dinner?

11:35.461 --> 11:37.964
Your mother and I
don't want you spending
any more time

11:37.998 --> 11:39.365
with Kim Kelly.
Do you understand?

11:39.399 --> 11:40.901
No, Dad,
she's my friend.

11:40.934 --> 11:42.703
I mean, yes,
she's not like Millie, but...

11:42.736 --> 11:44.505
HAROLD: No, she's not
like Millie all right.

11:44.538 --> 11:48.308
She's as dumb as a crayon.
Even her own mother says so.

11:48.341 --> 11:51.512
Dad, just because
Kim's mother is insane...

11:51.545 --> 11:55.582
No, she's not insane, honey,
she's practically a saint.

11:55.616 --> 11:57.217
Lindsay, do you know
what happens

11:57.250 --> 12:00.621
when you put
a rotten banana
in a fruit bowl?

12:00.654 --> 12:02.989
All the other
bananas go rotten.

12:03.023 --> 12:05.692
And that's what
Kim Kelly is:
a bad banana.

12:05.726 --> 12:09.663
Mrs. Kelly had some
pretty alarming things
to tell us about Kim.

12:09.696 --> 12:10.864
Like what?

12:10.897 --> 12:12.533
HAROLD: That she experiments.

12:12.566 --> 12:13.734
With drugs!

12:13.767 --> 12:15.836
And boys!

12:15.869 --> 12:17.370
Is that true,
honey?

12:21.407 --> 12:22.543
HAROLD: Enough said.

12:22.576 --> 12:24.344
Now, no more Kim Kelly!

12:27.413 --> 12:29.750
You know, maybe she
needs her head shrunk.

12:29.783 --> 12:31.752
Harold...

12:31.785 --> 12:33.654
It's about trust,
and frankly,

12:33.687 --> 12:35.288
I don't think
I trust her anymore.

12:35.321 --> 12:37.724
Lindsay's always been
very honest with us.

12:37.758 --> 12:39.059
Yeah.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.627
Well, she told us
she didn't cheat.

12:40.661 --> 12:41.895
We believed her.

12:42.896 --> 12:45.398
We ended up with egg
on our faces.

12:45.431 --> 12:47.200
Does Lindsay
have a diary?

12:48.635 --> 12:51.271
Yeah. I think
I've seen her
writing in it.

12:53.607 --> 12:55.676
Harold, no!

12:55.709 --> 12:57.744
That is her
private property.

12:57.778 --> 12:59.880
I just wanna know
what's going on.

12:59.913 --> 13:02.415
I had a diary
when I was little.

13:02.448 --> 13:04.751
If my parents had
read it, I would've
been furious.

13:04.785 --> 13:07.921
It's such
a violation.

13:07.954 --> 13:09.222
Spooning
with a stranger

13:09.255 --> 13:11.424
in the back seat of a van,
that's a violation!

13:11.457 --> 13:13.226
She hasn't done that.

13:15.962 --> 13:17.798
There's only one way
to know for sure.

13:20.567 --> 13:22.268
Good night, dear.
Good night.

13:27.007 --> 13:30.577
Oy. I've got
the worst gas.

13:30.611 --> 13:31.845
Please don't.

13:41.788 --> 13:43.223
All right,
I want Crisp.

13:46.660 --> 13:47.761
You heard him,
Crisp, come on.

13:47.794 --> 13:49.029
Join your team.

13:51.732 --> 13:53.066
You wanna play
shortstop?

13:54.334 --> 13:58.171
No. No, I like playing
back‐up right.

13:58.471 --> 14:00.006
You sure?

14:00.040 --> 14:02.075
Yeah, I like
playing back‐up.

14:03.844 --> 14:05.111
I can play shortstop.

14:05.145 --> 14:07.714
Yeah. And, uh, I'm
married to Raquel Welch.

14:07.748 --> 14:09.249

14:09.282 --> 14:11.251

14:11.284 --> 14:15.321
All right,
I'm gonna take, uh,
not Haverchuck.

14:16.456 --> 14:18.258
Heh heh. Funny.

14:22.829 --> 14:24.130
Hey!

14:24.164 --> 14:24.998
Hey, Kim.

14:25.031 --> 14:27.333
So my mom, like,
loved your parents.

14:27.367 --> 14:28.502
Guess it went all right.

14:28.535 --> 14:29.703
Yeah, I guess.

14:29.736 --> 14:31.304
What did your
parents say?

14:31.337 --> 14:33.173
Oh, they really
liked your mom.

14:33.206 --> 14:36.209
Cool. You know,
I'm glad it worked out.

14:37.377 --> 14:38.879
And they also said...

14:38.912 --> 14:41.682
Oh, they're such dorks.

14:41.715 --> 14:42.883
Get this.

14:42.916 --> 14:45.251
I'm not allowed
to hang out with you.

14:48.722 --> 14:49.990
It'll blow over.

14:50.023 --> 14:52.025
We've just got
to wait it out
a while, you know?

14:55.195 --> 14:56.597
Oh.

14:56.630 --> 14:58.098
Well, what did
they say about me?

14:58.498 --> 14:59.566
I don't know.

14:59.600 --> 15:01.234
No, you can tell me.

15:02.368 --> 15:03.469
I'm interested.

15:05.138 --> 15:07.574
He said you're
a bad banana.

15:08.408 --> 15:09.576
Aren't they queer?

15:10.476 --> 15:13.880
Yeah, what does
that mean, you know?

15:13.914 --> 15:16.249
I don't know. I guess
like a bad influence.

15:18.351 --> 15:20.320
Well, what else did
they say about me?

15:21.321 --> 15:22.355
Tell me!

(BELL RINGS)

you do drugs,
you have sex...

15:31.532 --> 15:33.399
Stupid stuff
like that.

15:35.869 --> 15:38.371
My parents
are morons, Kim.

15:38.404 --> 15:40.507
Wait. You don't
actually think
that I care

15:40.541 --> 15:43.076
about what your parents
think of me, do you?

15:44.645 --> 15:46.279
No. Of course not.

calling her name?

for God's sake.

is racing, Harold,

we should be doing this.

we wanna find out

what's going on in
our daughter's life,
don't we?

16:36.863 --> 16:38.899
I mean, for all
we know, she could
become a junkie

16:38.932 --> 16:40.133
or a hooker!

16:40.166 --> 16:42.503
Harold, she is not
gonna become a hooker.

16:42.536 --> 16:44.705
Well, everybody's
got parents, Jean.

21:11.805 --> 21:13.006
Got your shoes off?

21:14.074 --> 21:15.241
Good.

21:15.275 --> 21:17.210
So you guys got big plans
for the afternoon?

21:17.243 --> 21:19.145
Not really.

21:19.179 --> 21:20.814
We're gonna make
some phone calls.

21:20.847 --> 21:23.149
Ix‐nay ig‐bay outh‐may.

21:23.183 --> 21:24.985
Hey... Hey... Hey!

21:25.018 --> 21:27.253
I speak Pig Latin,
too, you know?

21:27.287 --> 21:28.722
Who you guys gonna call?

21:29.355 --> 21:30.991
Mean people.

21:31.024 --> 21:33.627
Oh. Prank calls, huh?

21:33.660 --> 21:36.096
Oh, well.
Boys will be boys.

21:36.129 --> 21:38.765
(CHUCKLING)
I could tell you some
great prank call stories.

21:39.966 --> 21:40.967
Really?

21:42.035 --> 21:43.103
All right.

21:43.136 --> 21:44.671
Just one.

21:44.705 --> 21:46.339
We used to pick out
a number,

21:46.372 --> 21:48.575
and we'd call it over
and over and over again.

21:48.609 --> 21:50.877
We'd keep asking
for Maurice, you know?

21:50.911 --> 21:53.914
We'd call and say,
"Hello, is Maurice there?

21:53.947 --> 21:55.215
"Hello, is Maurice there?

21:55.248 --> 21:56.683
"Hey, is Maurice at home?"

21:56.717 --> 21:58.484
You got the idea?
We'd call for Maurice a lot.

21:58.519 --> 22:02.656
We'd call back an hour later
and go, "Hello. This is
Maurice. Any messages?"

22:06.627 --> 22:07.594
Anyway...

22:07.628 --> 22:09.730
Just keep it clean,
all right?

22:09.763 --> 22:10.797
No heavy breathing.

22:10.831 --> 22:12.833
Okay.
See you later,
short‐stuff.

22:12.866 --> 22:13.900
Okay.

22:17.137 --> 22:20.306
Heavy breathing.
That's a good idea.

22:20.340 --> 22:22.509
Hey, I thought
your dad worked
during the day.

22:22.543 --> 22:25.211
Mm. Sometimes
he comes home
to change his shirt.

22:25.245 --> 22:26.813
Root canals
make him sweaty.

22:27.814 --> 22:30.083
Listen to this.
This is gonna be good.

22:30.116 --> 22:31.985

22:35.088 --> 22:37.223
Hello?
BILL: <i>Fredricks?</i>

22:37.257 --> 22:39.826
You're a turd.
A stinky, fat turd.

22:39.860 --> 22:43.163
Go sniff a jockstrap,
you poop‐head.

22:43.196 --> 22:44.531
You love patting
boys' butts.

22:44.565 --> 22:46.166
You love patting
boys' butts.

22:46.199 --> 22:48.268
Butt...
You butt patter.

22:48.301 --> 22:50.170
You're a perv
and a loser...

22:50.203 --> 22:53.073
And a stinky... Turd.

22:58.779 --> 23:00.313
Who was that?

23:00.346 --> 23:03.049
It's, uh,
an old friend.

23:06.753 --> 23:07.821
Oh‐ho.

23:07.854 --> 23:10.456
Oh, you better
hope he doesn't
find you out.

23:10.490 --> 23:13.894
You know,
if the cops
trace that...

23:13.927 --> 23:15.796
You're so dead.

23:18.431 --> 23:20.500
No, if the cops trace
the call, you're dead.

23:25.839 --> 23:27.774
Who does she
think she is anyway?

23:27.808 --> 23:29.309
I don't know.

23:29.342 --> 23:31.978
Let's talk about it
for four more hours
and try to find out.

23:32.012 --> 23:34.815
Oh! And you should've
heard her speaking Spanish.

23:34.848 --> 23:38.084
<i>"Un moment...</i>
<i>Un moment.</i>
<i>Kim... Kim!"</i>

23:38.118 --> 23:39.986
Oh, that sounds
terrible.

23:40.020 --> 23:44.224
Yeah. She thinks she's
the Queen of England
or something.

23:44.257 --> 23:45.526
Hmm.

23:46.793 --> 23:48.762
Oh, man!

23:49.696 --> 23:51.197
You know, will you
get me a stick?

23:51.231 --> 23:53.033
I'm gonna kill
that dog!

23:57.403 --> 23:59.405
Gross.

23:59.439 --> 24:01.241
I mean,
who are they,
you know?

24:01.274 --> 24:05.011
The great Weirs
to call me a whore
and a drug addict?

24:05.045 --> 24:07.914
Well, they didn't
actually call you
a whore and a drug addict.

24:09.182 --> 24:11.317
Basically, they did.

24:11.351 --> 24:14.655
And... I'm not
just some whore,
you know?

24:14.688 --> 24:16.757
They just can't
take it that I have
sex, you know?

24:16.790 --> 24:18.559
They're afraid
some bad man's
gonna come along

24:18.592 --> 24:21.227
and soil their
perfect little
daughter.

24:22.062 --> 24:23.764
Well, you do have sex.

24:25.398 --> 24:27.400
Well, yeah.
With you.

24:27.433 --> 24:29.102
Yeah, and I'm a bad man.

24:29.135 --> 24:31.538
What the hell
is that supposed
to mean?

24:31.572 --> 24:32.806
I don't know.

24:32.839 --> 24:34.541
If I had some
daughter in high school

24:34.575 --> 24:37.477
I wouldn't want some guy
crawlin' all over her.

24:37.511 --> 24:40.080
What the hell are
you talking about?

24:40.113 --> 24:43.249
I'm just saying
it's not like they
don't have a point.

24:43.283 --> 24:46.252
I mean, who wants
their kid to have sex
and do drugs?

24:46.286 --> 24:47.487
Nobody.

24:48.889 --> 24:49.956
You're a jerk.

24:51.224 --> 24:52.859
Hey, don't
get mad at me.

24:54.227 --> 24:55.562
I'm just tryin'
to be rational.

24:55.596 --> 24:57.297
Are you calling me
irrational?

24:57.330 --> 24:58.865
Because I'll tear
your head off, Daniel.

24:58.899 --> 25:01.167
I'll tear it off,
and I'll throw
it over that fence.

25:02.368 --> 25:03.670
Hey.

25:03.704 --> 25:05.405
I'm not saying
I don't love you.

25:05.438 --> 25:06.840
I like the way
you are.

25:09.142 --> 25:11.678
You probably just
scare the hell
out of them.

25:12.913 --> 25:14.515
Oh. And how am I?

25:15.148 --> 25:16.182
You...

25:16.216 --> 25:18.819
Are a sex‐crazed
drug addict.

25:19.520 --> 25:21.555
Screw you!

25:21.588 --> 25:23.256
Hey, come on.

25:23.289 --> 25:25.726
I didn't
mean nothin'.

25:25.759 --> 25:28.562
I'm just tryin'
to spice up
the conversation.

25:30.163 --> 25:33.700
Sam, you getting
a kickback from
the fire department?

25:33.734 --> 25:36.770
No. Mom was the one
who put the candles
on the table.

25:36.803 --> 25:39.573
Okay. I've got something
special for us tonight.

25:40.406 --> 25:42.175
Ta‐da!

25:42.208 --> 25:43.810
What the hell?

25:43.844 --> 25:47.648
Uh, Harold,
they're Cornish game hen
with a plum wine sauce.

25:47.681 --> 25:49.249
They're fantastic.

25:50.617 --> 25:53.654
What'd you do,
put poison in
a bird feeder?

25:54.187 --> 25:55.689
They're exotic.

25:56.322 --> 25:57.858
Is it a pigeon?

25:58.625 --> 26:00.326
It is not a pigeon.

26:00.360 --> 26:02.395
It's a kind of a chicken.

26:02.428 --> 26:05.732
Jean, you know
we can afford to buy
fully grown chickens.

26:07.067 --> 26:08.301
That‐a‐girl,
Lindsay.

26:08.334 --> 26:09.970
It's good to try new things.

26:10.771 --> 26:12.405
Lindsay, watch out!

26:12.438 --> 26:15.609
That little miniature
bird of yours is
trying to escape!

26:16.176 --> 26:17.277
But don't worry!

26:17.310 --> 26:18.845
My little chicken
will help him

26:18.879 --> 26:20.614
'cause I'm a brave
little chicken!

26:20.647 --> 26:22.082
I'm the hero, am I not?

26:22.115 --> 26:23.617
Yes! Is that right?

26:23.650 --> 26:25.085
That's right?

26:25.118 --> 26:28.088
Follow me! We will go!
Let's take off! Whoa!

26:28.121 --> 26:29.289
Whoo!

26:29.322 --> 26:30.657
Whoo!

Hey, Mom, Dad's
playing with his food.

26:34.027 --> 26:35.896
Well, it's better
than eating it.

26:35.929 --> 26:38.398
Just try it.
They're delicious.

26:38.431 --> 26:39.733
Help yourself to mine.

26:39.766 --> 26:41.768
I'm gonna go
make a sandwich.

26:41.802 --> 26:43.804
Yeah, me, too.
Sit down.

26:43.837 --> 26:45.639
Harold, if you're
not gonna eat,

26:45.672 --> 26:47.373
help clear the table.

26:47.407 --> 26:49.643
What? That's not my job.

26:49.676 --> 26:51.044
Oh, but it's mine?

26:51.077 --> 26:54.380
Yes. You don't
run a store
for 12 hours a day.

26:58.785 --> 27:00.854
All right, settle down.

27:00.887 --> 27:02.355
Don't bother changing yet.

27:02.388 --> 27:04.558
Oh, great.

27:04.591 --> 27:05.926

serious to say.

phone calls at my house.

Now, I know we got
a lot of jokers here,

27:16.770 --> 27:18.471
A lot of funny guys.
Let me tell you something.

27:18.505 --> 27:20.841
What you're doing
is not funny.

27:22.075 --> 27:23.376
It's annoying.

27:23.409 --> 27:25.912
More importantly,
it's illegal.

27:25.946 --> 27:27.614
So I want every one
of you comedians

27:27.648 --> 27:30.216

to be funny.

30:00.066 --> 30:01.635
Yeah?

31:16.242 --> 31:17.878
She's still mad.

31:17.911 --> 31:20.046
I know, but mostly
just her feelings are hurt.

31:20.847 --> 31:22.282
Oh, really?

31:22.315 --> 31:25.385
Hmm. Thought Kim was
too tough to have
her feelings hurt.

31:26.587 --> 31:27.654
Yeah, right.

31:28.221 --> 31:29.122
Kim?

31:29.155 --> 31:31.892
She's like the rawest
nerve there is.

31:31.925 --> 31:34.795
Yeah. She's like
a body without skin.

31:34.828 --> 31:35.962
She's like a bloody...

31:35.996 --> 31:38.331
Okay! I get it.

31:38.364 --> 31:40.200
Can you do it soon?

31:40.233 --> 31:42.503
'Cause she's really
being a pain in my ass.

31:43.203 --> 31:44.771
Yeah, okay.

31:44.805 --> 31:46.640
Great. I owe you my life.

31:47.207 --> 31:48.208
Thanks.

31:50.744 --> 31:52.513
All right!

31:52.546 --> 31:55.749
Haverchuck here
is one of our
captains today.

31:55.782 --> 31:57.317
Shouldn't
the team captain

31:57.350 --> 31:59.319
actually know how
to play baseball?

31:59.352 --> 32:01.855
Don't question me,
people, okay?

32:01.888 --> 32:03.323
Who's the other captain?

32:03.757 --> 32:05.058
Gordon Crisp.

32:05.926 --> 32:07.327
Gordon Crisp it is.

32:07.728 --> 32:09.195
Come on.

32:09.229 --> 32:11.497
BILL: Okay.
Who should I pick first?

32:11.532 --> 32:15.769
I need a power hitter
who can hustle in the field,

32:15.802 --> 32:17.704
with a strong arm.

32:17.738 --> 32:18.805
Gimme Weir.

32:18.839 --> 32:19.873
Come on, Weir.

32:19.906 --> 32:21.642
Yes! Ha ha ha!

32:21.675 --> 32:23.810
Ha ha ha!

32:23.844 --> 32:25.078
Gimme Lewis.

32:28.549 --> 32:29.616
Um...

32:29.650 --> 32:33.153
Now, we need a little speed
around the base pads.

32:34.187 --> 32:36.389
Uh, Schweiber.
Come on, Schweiber.

32:36.422 --> 32:37.524
Yes!

32:37.558 --> 32:39.626
Yeah!
Yeah, yeah!

32:39.660 --> 32:43.630
Oh, man, the geeks have
inherited the Earth.

32:43.664 --> 32:48.869
Today we are going to
continue our discussion
of <i>On the Road.</i>

32:48.902 --> 32:53.206
Ms. Proetzel's comments
last time about
pioneer symbolism

32:53.239 --> 32:55.542
were particularly
interesting.

32:55.576 --> 33:02.048
Ms. Kelly, I am sure
that you have some
original insights.

33:02.082 --> 33:05.552
Tell me what,
in your opinion,

33:05.586 --> 33:08.689
is the theme
of <i>On the Road?</i>

33:11.257 --> 33:14.795
The theme...
Of <i>On the Road</i>

33:14.828 --> 33:16.429
is...

33:20.500 --> 33:22.569
The theme's about...

33:25.706 --> 33:27.774
The theme is...

33:27.808 --> 33:29.776
America

33:29.810 --> 33:31.277
and...

33:33.814 --> 33:35.616
Being...

33:37.417 --> 33:39.019
On the road.

33:39.986 --> 33:43.089
On the Roadis about
being on the road.

33:43.123 --> 33:44.858
(LAUGHTER)
That's good.

33:44.891 --> 33:46.793
That's good.

33:47.828 --> 33:49.129
You... Go on.

33:51.364 --> 33:54.367
I hated the book,
all right?

33:54.400 --> 33:56.136
I have no idea
what it's about,

33:56.169 --> 33:58.839
and the writer was clearly
on drugs when he wrote it.

33:58.872 --> 34:01.875
I mean, it went on
and on and on,

34:01.908 --> 34:04.811
like it was written
in a total hurry.

34:04.845 --> 34:06.179
If I handed in
something like this,

34:06.212 --> 34:08.148
there's no way I'd get
a good grade on it.

34:08.181 --> 34:11.184
I mean, it's boring,
and it's unorganized,

34:11.217 --> 34:13.954
and I only read
30 pages of it anyway.

34:13.987 --> 34:15.856
Well, that was
passionate,

34:15.889 --> 34:18.391
albeit entirely
misinformed.

34:18.424 --> 34:24.264
Who dares follows
Miss Kelly's
lucid analysis, hmm?

34:24.698 --> 34:26.199
Yes.

34:26.232 --> 34:28.034
Well, I think Kim's right.

34:28.068 --> 34:29.369
Kerouac was high
on Benzedrine

34:29.402 --> 34:31.838
during the three weeks he took
to write <i>On the Road.</i>

34:31.872 --> 34:33.574
The structure of the story
isn't strong,

34:33.607 --> 34:36.176
and his experiments with
prose style are tedious.

34:36.209 --> 34:39.946
In fact, Truman Capote
said about <i>On the Road,</i>

34:39.980 --> 34:42.282
"That isn't writing.
It's typing."

34:45.819 --> 34:47.588
Pearls before swine.

34:49.289 --> 34:50.757
What the hell
does that mean?

34:50.791 --> 34:52.092
(LAUGHTER)

34:53.527 --> 34:56.830
Hey, man, sure had
a lot of fun
with your wife last night.

34:56.863 --> 34:58.098
My what?

35:01.334 --> 35:03.236
Ball four. Take your base.

35:04.404 --> 35:06.472
I mean,
a lot of fun!

35:10.310 --> 35:12.546
What's the matter with you?
Are you hurt?

35:12.579 --> 35:14.581
Um... Time!

35:14.615 --> 35:15.749
All right, time out!

35:18.084 --> 35:20.120
What? I told you
I couldn't pitch.

35:20.153 --> 35:21.988
It's not about
your pitching, Sam.

35:22.022 --> 35:23.790
Then what are you
doing out here?

35:25.191 --> 35:27.794
I just always wanted to call
a meeting on the mound.

35:28.629 --> 35:29.896
This is so cool.

35:30.396 --> 35:31.231
Hey.

35:31.264 --> 35:32.766
Meeting
on the mound?

35:33.433 --> 35:34.334
Very cool.

35:34.367 --> 35:38.204
Listen, Bill,
I've got nothing left.

35:38.238 --> 35:41.141
Why don't you just let
one of those jocks pitch?

35:41.174 --> 35:43.076
What are you
talking about?

35:43.109 --> 35:44.878
This is our game.

35:44.911 --> 35:47.113
We can do this.

35:47.147 --> 35:48.481
I don't want them to think
they were right

35:48.515 --> 35:51.484
for putting me
in deep right field
for 11 years.

35:51.852 --> 35:53.286
Come on!

35:54.020 --> 35:55.255
Come on!

35:56.189 --> 35:57.791
He's the butt patter.

35:58.124 --> 35:59.425
Ugh!

36:00.561 --> 36:03.196
(THEME FROM ROCKY PLAYING)

37:33.787 --> 37:35.756
Yeah! (LAUGHING)

37:37.991 --> 37:39.259
Tag up!

37:39.893 --> 37:42.729
We did it!
We did it!

37:43.063 --> 37:44.330
Tag up!

37:45.599 --> 37:48.835
That's the first out,
you morons!

37:52.939 --> 37:54.575
Huh?
Oh.

37:55.141 --> 37:56.510
Well...

37:56.543 --> 37:58.845
Only eight and two‐thirds
more innings to go.

37:58.879 --> 38:00.013
Yeah!

38:00.614 --> 38:01.548
Ha ha!

38:01.582 --> 38:03.750
You see that?
I looked like Willie Mays!

38:06.920 --> 38:08.955
Hey, Kim, Kim.

38:09.756 --> 38:10.757
Kim!

38:11.958 --> 38:12.993
Yeah?

38:13.026 --> 38:15.028
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

38:15.061 --> 38:16.496
What do you want?

38:17.998 --> 38:19.566
What are you doing
right now?

38:22.102 --> 38:23.403
Nothing.

38:24.404 --> 38:25.972
Do you wanna
come over my house?

38:27.073 --> 38:28.408
I thought
we could hang out.

38:29.643 --> 38:31.812
Well, what about
your parents?

38:32.813 --> 38:33.914
What about them?

38:41.054 --> 38:43.023
Daniel,
I'll see you later.

38:43.056 --> 38:44.490
I'm gonna go over
to Lindsay's.

38:44.525 --> 38:46.927
Okay. Later.
God, this is good.

38:46.960 --> 38:48.695
Another day
of hanging out
with him,

38:48.729 --> 38:50.897
and I'd
puke my guts out.

38:50.931 --> 38:52.465
Swear to God.

38:54.535 --> 38:58.204
Jean, is the grocery store
out of normal food?

38:58.238 --> 38:59.272
Is that the problem?

38:59.305 --> 39:00.641
This is normal food.

39:00.674 --> 39:03.076
No. Normal food
is pot roast.

39:03.109 --> 39:04.477
Normal food is meat loaf.

39:04.511 --> 39:07.881
It is dead animal,
and it is not on fire.

39:09.916 --> 39:12.819
No! No! No, no!

39:20.026 --> 39:23.564
Maybe some of us are up
for something a little
different around here.

39:23.597 --> 39:26.066
Don't you wanna
live life, Harold?

39:26.099 --> 39:29.102
Or maybe you've
just turned into
a mean old man.

39:32.906 --> 39:34.174
(SOBBING)

39:34.207 --> 39:36.510
Don't you run away from me!

39:36.543 --> 39:39.245
What's wrong with us,
Harold?

39:39.279 --> 39:41.447
What's happened to us?

39:43.016 --> 39:44.985
We need change,
don't we?

39:45.018 --> 39:47.320
Things need
to change.

39:47.353 --> 39:50.223
I don't want us
to just be robots.

39:50.256 --> 39:51.525
We are not robots,

39:51.558 --> 39:53.527
and things do not
need to change.

39:53.560 --> 39:55.361
I like how things are.

39:55.395 --> 39:57.297
I like eating
the same things.

39:57.330 --> 39:58.565
And you know why?

39:58.599 --> 40:00.567
Because those are
the things I like.

40:00.601 --> 40:03.203
I like chicken,
and I like pot roast.

40:03.236 --> 40:05.706
And that's how I feel
about you, Jean.

40:05.739 --> 40:07.273
Oh, please.

40:07.307 --> 40:10.243
You like me like you
like a pot roast?

40:10.276 --> 40:12.345
I love pot roast!

40:12.378 --> 40:15.281
God, you just
don't get it, do you?

40:15.315 --> 40:17.884
I give up! I quit!

40:17.918 --> 40:19.119
Is that right?

40:19.152 --> 40:21.722
Yes! You don't
appreciate me.

40:21.755 --> 40:23.489
Maybe I'll go back
to school.

40:23.524 --> 40:24.791
What about that?

40:26.693 --> 40:28.995
You think
I don't appreciate you?

40:30.030 --> 40:31.431
Well, I do.

40:35.268 --> 40:37.971
Everything I do,
I do to serve you.

40:39.039 --> 40:40.340
I think of you when I'm...

40:40.373 --> 40:43.877
Stocking fishing poles,
and...

40:43.910 --> 40:49.650
I think of you when I'm
answering questions about
cross‐country ski wax.

40:49.683 --> 40:52.586
My whole life
is about serving you.

40:54.120 --> 40:55.656
And I love you, Jean.

41:02.028 --> 41:03.229
Thank you.

41:06.299 --> 41:07.801
You mean it?

41:17.243 --> 41:19.212
Mom, Dad, we're home.

41:21.815 --> 41:23.249
Ooh.

41:23.283 --> 41:25.051
Is this what's for dinner?

41:26.687 --> 41:27.721
Ugh.

Let's get outta here.

What?

42:09.963 --> 42:11.297
Hey, Linds...

42:12.733 --> 42:13.967
I know what you're
trying to do,

42:14.000 --> 42:16.903
but, you know,
we don't have
to do this.

42:17.137 --> 42:18.171
No.

42:18.204 --> 42:19.973
I want to.

42:20.006 --> 42:22.576
All right, but if they
call the cops on me,

42:22.609 --> 42:23.910
I'm outta here.

42:27.480 --> 42:28.815
NEAL: Hey, Lindsay.

42:29.950 --> 42:32.719
I was catcher
in gym class today.

42:33.453 --> 42:35.055
That's great, Neal.

42:36.590 --> 42:38.592
In their room.

been in there
for over an hour.

Uh, I think we're gonna
order food in tonight,

a pizza place

and have them deliver.

43:08.088 --> 43:09.556
Nice to see you, Kim.

a word with you, please?
