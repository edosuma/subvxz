00:32.756 --> 00:36.933
Salt! Some ice,
and there we are.

00:37.796 --> 00:42.087
Love tequila, how
I love tequila.

00:42.111 --> 00:43.260
Hey sweetie.

00:43.284 --> 00:45.228
Sweetie, sweetie...

00:45.252 --> 00:47.885
Come on, I got the drinks.

00:47.909 --> 00:48.910
It's your favorite!

00:50.326 --> 00:52.373
Come and have a
little drinky-poos.

00:52.397 --> 00:56.125
See? I knew you likes it.
I know you did. Yes.

01:13.625 --> 01:15.913
You're actually a rather
good dancer, you know?

01:15.937 --> 01:17.284
Yes, you are.

01:27.190 --> 01:30.342
Daddy's going below, to make
himself another drinky-poo.

01:30.366 --> 01:31.170
You want one?

01:31.194 --> 01:32.137
Hmm?

01:32.161 --> 01:33.438
Wha What's that?

01:34.197 --> 01:35.416
A double?

01:35.440 --> 01:37.590
Ooh... You're getting
daring, aren't you?

01:37.614 --> 01:39.282
Well, there's a good boy.

01:39.306 --> 01:40.928
Stay there, hmm?

02:07.207 --> 02:08.207
Sweetie!

02:08.231 --> 02:10.347
I got more drinks.

02:10.371 --> 02:14.179
Little bit of a fruit
cocktail to go with this one.

02:14.203 --> 02:15.145
Wooh!

02:15.169 --> 02:17.182
Unsteady stay on the pins...

02:17.206 --> 02:18.690
for some reason.

02:19.898 --> 02:21.934
Yes! Sweetie?

02:23.246 --> 02:26.353
Where are you.

02:29.010 --> 02:30.011
Sweetie?

02:31.358 --> 02:32.359
Sweetie?

02:33.946 --> 02:36.062
Sweetie, for God's sakes!

02:36.086 --> 02:39.089
Sweetie? Sweetie, where are you?

02:39.711 --> 02:40.712
Sweetie!

02:41.437 --> 02:42.437
Sweetie!

04:13.218 --> 04:15.645
- Sits all day like a
lump in his chair.

04:15.669 --> 04:18.648
Never does anything
around the house anymore!

04:18.672 --> 04:20.615
I got to do it all!

04:20.639 --> 04:24.481
Yesterday, I split a whole half
cod of wood all by myself.

04:24.505 --> 04:28.105
Ask him to do the simplest
thing, and he's tired.

04:28.129 --> 04:29.579
Like I'm not tired?

04:31.167 --> 04:33.007
I'd like to hear what
Alvis has to say.

04:33.031 --> 04:35.596
- It-it's no wonder
he's gaining weight.

04:35.620 --> 04:37.839
I'd gain weight too if
I had someone else do

04:37.863 --> 04:39.289
all my work for me.

04:39.313 --> 04:42.420
- Ruth, I'd like to
speak with Alvis alone.

04:43.352 --> 04:46.365
He can't tell you
anything I can't.

04:46.389 --> 04:47.987
Can you, Alvis?

04:48.011 --> 04:51.083
- Nope!

04:51.705 --> 04:54.822
- And he's got the thermostat
cranked up so high,

04:54.846 --> 04:56.893
the whole house it like a sauna.

04:56.917 --> 05:01.484
82 degrees! I'm gonna
die of a heat stroke!

05:01.508 --> 05:04.797
You got to do something
about him, and quick!

05:04.821 --> 05:06.754
- What would you like
me to do, exactly?

05:08.549 --> 05:09.549
- Fix him!

05:22.770 --> 05:25.370
- That's all I've been
pulling up this week.

05:25.394 --> 05:28.431
Ain't a single lobster
in any of my traps.

05:29.536 --> 05:31.997
Reuben and Emmett been pulling
up that same stuff, too.

05:32.021 --> 05:34.264
That crap, whatever it is.

05:34.713 --> 05:37.485
- Ctenophores.

05:37.509 --> 05:39.477
- Gelatinous zooplankton.

05:41.099 --> 05:42.490
It's a comb jellyfish.

05:42.514 --> 05:44.423
Hell, I know it's a jellyfish!

05:44.447 --> 05:46.425
But what are they doing
up here in December?

05:46.449 --> 05:50.256
You-you're the
biologist, you tell me!

05:50.280 --> 05:51.760
We've had jellyfish
blooms here before

05:51.784 --> 05:54.709
but usually in the summer
like that weird invasion

05:54.733 --> 05:56.366
of moon jellies
we had last July.

05:56.390 --> 05:58.610
- Look, all I care about
is my bottom line.

05:58.634 --> 06:01.440
Where did all the
fish and lobsters go?

06:01.464 --> 06:03.052
- I don't know.

06:04.467 --> 06:06.400
Something's happening out there.

06:08.816 --> 06:10.104
- Yeah, I just finished it,

06:10.128 --> 06:13.407
I'm emailing the file
to you as we speak.

06:14.822 --> 06:17.307
I'll be on the afternoon ferry.
I'll see you tonight.

06:22.140 --> 06:23.590
God, get me off this island.

06:28.491 --> 06:30.400
- Jess, two burgers.

06:30.424 --> 06:31.953
- Same thing's happening to me.

06:31.977 --> 06:35.084
Last few days haven't pulled
in so much as a guppy.

06:36.085 --> 06:38.235
Usually expect at
least a fish or two.

06:38.259 --> 06:40.065
But my nets have been empty.

06:40.089 --> 06:42.343
- Yup, that makes three of us.

06:42.367 --> 06:45.898
Uhh, Donnie. His
traps came up empty.

06:45.922 --> 06:47.648
He's givin' up for the season.

06:48.615 --> 06:50.593
- So, Arthur...

06:50.617 --> 06:54.113
this is a multi-species drop,
to have everything collapse

06:54.137 --> 06:57.969
at once. The lobster,
fish, scallops.

07:02.111 --> 07:04.607
- A few years ago, off
the cost of Maryland,

07:04.631 --> 07:06.919
the whole fishery
suddenly collapsed.

07:06.943 --> 07:08.473
- Sorry to butt in, sorry.

07:08.497 --> 07:10.751
Couldn't help overhearing.

07:10.775 --> 07:12.880
What do you think
is causing this?

07:13.778 --> 07:15.514
- Well it could be a
number of things.

07:15.538 --> 07:18.344
I mean, basically our species
has declared war on the fish,

07:18.368 --> 07:19.622
the fish are losing.

07:19.646 --> 07:21.520
All these super trawlers,
the high tech nets.

07:21.544 --> 07:23.039
Sonar, climate change.

07:23.063 --> 07:24.834
Now you got him startled.

07:24.858 --> 07:27.284
- Okay, okay. I'll stop.

07:27.308 --> 07:29.286
You've all hear my
angry biologist rant.

07:29.310 --> 07:30.840
- We'll, uh, I haven't hear it.

07:30.864 --> 07:33.625
I'm-I'm interested.

07:34.799 --> 07:37.294
- Are you gonna put this
in your novel, Titus?

07:37.318 --> 07:39.849
- Well, you never know what'll
end up in one of my novels.

07:39.873 --> 07:40.884
- Ahh.

07:40.908 --> 07:42.268
- Maybe you'll make
and appearance.

07:42.292 --> 07:45.613
- As long as I'm good lookin'
like George Clooney,

07:45.637 --> 07:48.651
give me a hot love scene
with Jesse over here.

07:48.675 --> 07:49.848
- Get his wife a gun.

07:51.747 --> 07:54.139
Are you sure you're
leaving us today?

07:54.163 --> 07:56.693
- Well, I finally finished
my novel and I gotta get

07:56.717 --> 07:58.557
back to New York City.

07:58.581 --> 08:01.491
- You know, we've been seeing
you work on this book for

08:01.515 --> 08:03.735
about three weeks now, but
you never told us what

08:03.759 --> 08:04.759
it's about.

08:06.002 --> 08:09.257
- Well, it takes
place on an island,

08:09.281 --> 08:10.673
just like this one.

08:10.697 --> 08:11.743
That's why I came here.

08:11.767 --> 08:14.908
Cause I wanted to get
all the details right.

08:18.912 --> 08:22.719
It's a story about love.

08:22.743 --> 08:25.722
And jealousy,

08:25.746 --> 08:29.899
and a very pretty girl

08:29.923 --> 08:31.083
who works at the local diner.

08:31.107 --> 08:32.868
- Jess, can I have
a refill, please?

08:35.410 --> 08:37.931
You're gonna have to read
the book to find out.

08:50.737 --> 08:53.705
That guy's not coming back, Jess.
You know he isn't.

08:56.984 --> 09:00.308
- Another chance... with you.

09:00.332 --> 09:02.093
- Turkey club!

09:03.094 --> 09:04.589
- I gotta go.

09:04.613 --> 09:06.867
- I'm taking my boat out to
Rockland this afternoon,

09:06.891 --> 09:09.421
to get my radar fixed.

09:09.445 --> 09:12.700
Would you want to come?

09:12.724 --> 09:15.392
We'll be back the
day after tomorrow.

09:15.416 --> 09:21.422
We can get dinner,
maybe see a movie,

09:24.633 --> 09:25.634
like the old days?

09:28.844 --> 09:31.477
- I have to work.

09:31.501 --> 09:34.653
- At least come
down to the dock.

09:34.677 --> 09:36.793
You can see me off.

09:36.817 --> 09:38.267
- Jess, turkey club.

10:02.394 --> 10:04.569
Ooh, neat!

10:06.571 --> 10:07.790
Lucy.

10:07.814 --> 10:09.894
You unwrapped your own
Christmas present, didn't you?

10:09.918 --> 10:11.966
- I just wanted to make
sure you got the right one.

10:11.990 --> 10:14.451
And even though it's
not, like, the best.

10:14.475 --> 10:17.213
It does have a 64 gig card
and multi-spectral dynamic

10:17.237 --> 10:19.353
imaging. And you remember
I wanted the built in la-

10:19.377 --> 10:22.839
- Just put it back
under the tree.

10:22.863 --> 10:24.382
You don't want to
spoil the surprise.

10:25.866 --> 10:28.155
I already know what
you and Dad got me.

10:28.179 --> 10:29.180
- You're dad doesn't.

10:37.706 --> 10:38.948
- Go to your room, Ellie.

10:40.191 --> 10:43.194
- Please. Just go to your room.

10:49.925 --> 10:50.925
- Hey, honey.

10:55.275 --> 10:58.564
- Sam, we need to talk.

10:58.588 --> 11:00.808
Beverly called to
me this morning.

11:00.832 --> 11:03.742
- Mitch, it's happening
again just as we expected.

11:03.766 --> 11:06.089
Multiple reports,
multiple fishermen.

11:06.113 --> 11:07.884
Traps and nets are up empty.

11:07.908 --> 11:09.708
If you could send a few
grad students and that

11:09.732 --> 11:11.182
exascan sonar unit.

11:12.085 --> 11:13.125
- They're launching a new-

11:17.780 --> 11:19.551
They're launching
a new magazine.

11:19.575 --> 11:21.277
There's a spot on
the MASDT for me.

11:21.301 --> 11:23.762
- We are talking about the
collapse of a major fishery.

11:23.786 --> 11:25.892
You can't spare even
a few grad students?

11:29.481 --> 11:30.897
- Sam, I'm going back to Boston.

11:33.278 --> 11:34.659
- Mitch, I'll call you back.

11:37.662 --> 11:41.884
- I tried to make it
here, I really did.

11:41.908 --> 11:44.634
But two years on this island...

11:48.915 --> 11:50.330
I'm suffocating.

11:51.503 --> 11:52.943
I need to get back
to the real world.

11:52.967 --> 11:55.311
- The real world,
what does that mean?

11:55.335 --> 11:58.072
- Uhh-someplace not
surrounded by water.

11:58.096 --> 12:01.099
Where I can work. I can't
turn down this job offer.

12:02.169 --> 12:05.493
I can come up here
ever few weeks.

12:05.517 --> 12:07.772
Or we can all move back
to Boston together.

12:07.796 --> 12:08.831
- I can't.

12:10.074 --> 12:12.811
I can't leave now.
I need to be here.

12:12.835 --> 12:15.296
What I predicted is
finally happening.

12:15.320 --> 12:16.320
- Right.

12:17.667 --> 12:19.956
The fish are vanishing.
The ocean is dying.

12:19.980 --> 12:20.980
The world is doomed.

12:23.604 --> 12:26.066
You know how hard
change is for her.

12:26.090 --> 12:29.241
And she's finally settled in.
She loves it here.

12:29.265 --> 12:30.933
- Please don't bring
Ellie into this.

12:30.957 --> 12:32.477
- Well I have to bring
Ellie into this.

12:32.501 --> 12:33.590
She's my daughter.

12:33.614 --> 12:34.823
- She's not mine.

12:36.997 --> 12:37.997
I'm sorry.

12:41.691 --> 12:42.692
I'm sorry.

12:45.834 --> 12:47.042
I have to finish packing.

13:18.901 --> 13:21.559
- Made you a corn beef sandwich.

13:24.010 --> 13:25.010
- Thanks.

13:28.152 --> 13:31.890
Are you, uhm-are you sure you
don't want to come with me?

13:31.914 --> 13:33.512
- Val needs me.

13:33.536 --> 13:35.849
Some new guest might be
coming in on the ferry.

13:37.195 --> 13:39.275
- And you want to spend every
last minute with Titus.

13:44.375 --> 13:46.375
- Have a good trip, Emmett.
I'll see you Wednesday.

13:54.109 --> 13:57.767
- One thing you know about
me is I always come back.

14:06.190 --> 14:10.066
- And that's the last
patient of the day.

14:10.090 --> 14:11.930
- Oh, just in time
to catch the ferry.

14:11.954 --> 14:13.898
- Oh, uh, do you have your sea.

14:13.922 --> 14:15.865
- Right here in my bag.

14:15.889 --> 14:17.009
I'll see you in March, Nina.

14:17.033 --> 14:18.212
- Have a Merry Christmas.

14:18.236 --> 14:22.033
Oh, hey. Do you have any
plans for the holiday?

14:23.276 --> 14:26.048
A glass of wine and a good book.

14:26.072 --> 14:29.075
I'm gonna spend it all by myself.
So that's fine with me,

14:30.122 --> 14:31.122
Okay.

14:31.146 --> 14:33.044
Bye.

14:34.839 --> 14:37.877
Damn. The power went out.

17:11.202 --> 17:14.112
Look, I've been trying to
reach the ferry for an hour

17:14.136 --> 17:16.252
but no one's responding
on the radio.

17:16.276 --> 17:18.910
Our power's out and so
is cell phone service.

17:18.934 --> 17:21.178
You can hear we're on
back up generator, here.

17:22.213 --> 17:24.881
- Internet's out.
Anyone else got it?

17:24.905 --> 17:26.228
- It's out at the clinics, too.

17:26.252 --> 17:29.714
So, no one knows why the
ferry didn't show up?

17:29.738 --> 17:33.235
- When the ferry cancels, it's
either weather or mechanical.

17:33.259 --> 17:35.582
- Well. the weather
seems fine to me.

17:35.606 --> 17:37.549
- So it's gotta be mechanical.

17:37.573 --> 17:39.448
It'll show up when the fix it.

17:39.472 --> 17:42.589
Well, I-I have to get back
to New York City tomorrow.

17:42.613 --> 17:44.901
- My daughter's expecting
me for the holidays.

17:44.925 --> 17:48.319
- Well, I'm expecting and
Amazon package tomorrow.

17:48.343 --> 17:52.116
If Barb don't get a Christmas
present I'm... dead-meat.

17:52.140 --> 17:54.463
- You haven't got Barb a
Christmas present, yet?

17:54.487 --> 17:56.040
What's wrong with you?

17:56.696 --> 17:58.950
- Looks like nobody's getting
off the island tonight.

17:58.974 --> 18:00.089
I'm goin' home.

18:00.113 --> 18:01.433
- I'm sure it'll
be here tomorrow.

18:01.457 --> 18:03.097
- It better. It's got
the monthly shipment

18:03.121 --> 18:04.128
of diesel on it.

18:04.152 --> 18:07.441
Storage tank's are getting
mighty low down on the docks.

18:07.465 --> 18:10.237
- Looks like you two'll
need lodgin' again tonight.

18:10.261 --> 18:12.263
- I'll make sure there
rooms are ready.

18:16.302 --> 18:17.302
- Thanks.

18:36.667 --> 18:38.347
- We're shutting off
the generator in about

18:38.371 --> 18:40.302
fifteen minutes.

18:40.326 --> 18:43.443
I brought you a flashlight
and some candles.

18:43.467 --> 18:45.307
- Thanks, Jesse.

18:45.331 --> 18:48.172
- I'm sorry about your
ferry not showing.

18:48.196 --> 18:50.312
That's kinda how
it goes, though.

18:50.336 --> 18:54.178
Living on an island,
can't count on anything.

18:54.202 --> 18:57.550
Ferry, power, the weather.

19:06.904 --> 19:08.640
- I always lived here.

19:08.664 --> 19:11.253
And never had a good
enough reason to leave.

19:13.255 --> 19:15.509
I could use one.

19:15.533 --> 19:17.994
- It's only 40 miles
to the mainland,

19:18.018 --> 19:21.377
it's not like from
here to the moon.

19:21.401 --> 19:23.207
- Sometimes feels like it.

19:23.231 --> 19:27.176
I mean, just about everything
comes from the mainland,

19:27.200 --> 19:29.237
but, without the ferry-

19:33.896 --> 19:35.415
this is all we're left with.

19:47.393 --> 19:50.430
Well, at least I get
one night with you.

20:13.419 --> 20:15.466
I like your little waitress
outfit, by the way.

20:15.490 --> 20:16.767
- Yeah.

20:17.768 --> 20:19.780
Wish you'd wear it all the time.

20:19.804 --> 20:22.082
- I think I can manage that.

20:35.406 --> 20:37.626
- Ell tells me
you're a novelist.

20:37.650 --> 20:38.730
Anything I might have read?

20:41.309 --> 20:45.254
- Uhh, only if the name Titus
McLean means anything to you.

20:45.278 --> 20:46.969
- Sorry, it doesn't.

20:49.489 --> 20:51.295
- I hear you're a doctor.

20:51.319 --> 20:53.676
- Locum tenens.

20:53.700 --> 20:55.460
I'm filling in while
they looking for someone

20:55.484 --> 20:57.473
permanent to take
over the islands.

20:57.497 --> 21:01.028
It seems like I spend most
of my time on ferry's.

21:01.052 --> 21:02.478
When they're running.

21:02.502 --> 21:05.505
- It'll show up today, trust me.

21:08.336 --> 21:09.336
- Trust him.

22:06.428 --> 22:08.568
- Looks like you'll have
to stay for Christmas.

22:11.502 --> 22:13.504
Wouldn't be so bad, would it?

22:15.886 --> 22:18.382
- It just makes things harder.

22:18.406 --> 22:19.866
- I want it to be harder,

22:19.890 --> 22:22.040
I don't want it to be so
easy for you to leave me.

22:22.064 --> 22:25.043
- I'm not leaving you.

22:25.067 --> 22:26.666
I'm leaving this island.

22:26.690 --> 22:28.115
- It works out the same.

22:28.139 --> 22:30.428
- But then come with me,
then let's leave together.

22:30.452 --> 22:32.385
You could find a new job,
talk to the university.

22:40.945 --> 22:44.718
- I burned that bridge.
- Right.

22:44.742 --> 22:47.687
- And besides, I
need to stay hear.

22:47.711 --> 22:49.792
I need to finish the study.

22:49.816 --> 22:54.521
- You're chasing a phantom, Sammy.
You need to move on.

22:54.545 --> 22:57.755
Rachel's dead. And
whatever she believed...

22:59.619 --> 23:00.619
I'm sorry.

23:03.658 --> 23:05.107
I shouldn't have brought her up.

23:14.254 --> 23:15.497
Uhm...

23:17.775 --> 23:19.408
- I don't know
anymore than you do.

23:19.432 --> 23:21.306
I can't raise the Clara
Bee on the radio,

23:21.330 --> 23:22.446
and the phone's still out.

23:22.470 --> 23:24.482
- Well I can't raise
anybody on the VHF.

23:24.506 --> 23:25.932
That's never happened before.

23:25.956 --> 23:27.658
- Emmett went over to
Rockland yesterday.

23:27.682 --> 23:30.270
He'll let us know what's
going on when he gets back.

23:35.448 --> 23:38.496
Hey, Doc. Guess who's staying
with us another night?

23:38.520 --> 23:41.016
- Mmhmm.

23:41.040 --> 23:42.914
- Coffee and a B.L.T.

23:42.938 --> 23:44.951
- That will be without
lettuce or tomato,

23:44.975 --> 23:47.643
fresh vegetable just ran
out, and breads not doing

23:47.667 --> 23:48.679
so well either.

23:48.703 --> 23:50.646
- I got about two days
worth of diesel left

23:50.670 --> 23:51.923
from my generator.

23:51.947 --> 23:54.098
I'm gonna have to start
cutting' down trees

23:54.122 --> 23:55.824
just to stay warm. - Yeah.

23:55.848 --> 23:57.032
- Folks are getting' upset.

23:57.056 --> 23:58.585
- More like thrilled.

23:58.609 --> 24:00.890
This is the most excitement
that's happened to this island

24:00.914 --> 24:01.914
in years.

24:02.544 --> 24:04.384
- Hey, Sam. You're
the science guy.

24:04.408 --> 24:06.479
You got a theory on
what's goin' on here?

24:09.827 --> 24:12.599
- Maybe the undersea
cable got disrupted

24:12.623 --> 24:15.050
dragged up in an anchor, or something.
That could

24:15.074 --> 24:16.776
take out the power
and the phone-line.

24:16.800 --> 24:19.492
- Doesn't explain why the
ferry hasn't shown up.

24:37.165 --> 24:39.063
- Tucker island to Gladys Wink.

24:44.103 --> 24:46.692
Gladys Wink, where are you?
Over.

25:01.534 --> 25:05.814
Emmett, please answer me.

25:09.128 --> 25:10.957
Emmett.

25:33.601 --> 25:36.890
- Three days without
a single word.

25:36.914 --> 25:39.583
We can handle the
ferry not showing up,

25:39.607 --> 25:42.586
it's the not knowing
that bothers me.

25:42.610 --> 25:44.991
Why hasn't the ferry come?

25:45.785 --> 25:47.960
End of the world.

25:48.995 --> 25:51.698
- Shut up, Reuben.
It's not funny.

25:51.722 --> 25:54.805
What if there was a disaster

25:54.829 --> 25:55.737
we haven't heard about?

25:55.761 --> 25:58.084
- We're out of bread
and milk at home.

25:58.108 --> 26:01.743
My kids are eating peanut
butter for breakfast.

26:01.767 --> 26:04.780
- I have a enough diesel to run
the generator for a few more

26:04.804 --> 26:06.989
days, but when that runs
out, we're in the dark.

26:07.013 --> 26:09.751
- No heat. No lights.

26:09.775 --> 26:13.133
- Instead of snickering, Reuben,
why don't you head to Rockland

26:13.157 --> 26:14.717
and find out what's
goin' on over there?

26:14.741 --> 26:16.857
- Emmett's already on his way back.
He'll let us know

26:16.881 --> 26:19.795
what's goin' on.

26:19.819 --> 26:21.659
- He was supposed to
be back yesterday.

26:21.683 --> 26:24.628
Where is he?

26:24.652 --> 26:26.343
- I don't know.

26:57.650 --> 26:59.973
- You really need all
them beans, Lars?

26:59.997 --> 27:01.388
- You never know.

27:01.412 --> 27:03.770
- 'Cause that's the last of 'em.
You should leave some

27:03.794 --> 27:07.049
for other folks. Who knows when
that ferry's gonna run again?

27:07.073 --> 27:09.362
- I don't see any limit posted.

27:09.386 --> 27:10.674
- Maybe there oughta be.

27:10.698 --> 27:13.400
- There's no more
evaporated milk.

27:13.424 --> 27:16.887
Does anyone have a few cans
they can spare for my kids?

27:16.911 --> 27:18.129
Anyone?

27:18.153 --> 27:19.833
- Oh, come on, Lars.
Give 'em one of yours.

27:19.857 --> 27:21.132
- Early bird gets the worm.

27:21.156 --> 27:23.341
- Oh, damnit, Lars.
Give 'em one.

27:23.365 --> 27:24.135
- No.

27:24.159 --> 27:25.159
- Yes.
- No.

27:25.885 --> 27:27.380
- Hey. Stop it! Come on!
Come on!

27:27.404 --> 27:28.404
Come on!

27:34.894 --> 27:36.689
- We're gonna start
eating each other next.

27:38.518 --> 27:40.531
Crisis like this, you'd
think they'd pull together.

27:40.555 --> 27:42.740
In stead, they're starting
to tear each other apart.

27:42.764 --> 27:46.088
- They're scared. And I
can understand that.

27:46.112 --> 27:47.883
They think the rest of
the world's vanished,

27:47.907 --> 27:50.265
and we're on our own.

27:50.289 --> 27:53.406
At least no one will starve.
They could always go fishing.

27:53.430 --> 27:55.822
- Good luck catching anything.

27:55.846 --> 27:58.169
Boat's will be out
of diesel soon.

27:58.193 --> 27:59.885
All the fish have vanished.

28:01.196 --> 28:04.417
Yeah, no one's picked
anything up in weeks.

28:04.441 --> 28:06.823
No lobsters, no fish.

28:08.928 --> 28:11.631
- It's a question I'm
trying' to answer.

28:11.655 --> 28:14.634
I wrote a paper on the
phenomenon a few years ago.

28:14.658 --> 28:17.257
Sudden Unexplained
Collapse of a fishery.

28:17.281 --> 28:18.558
SUC Fish for short.

28:20.077 --> 28:22.884
It sounds funny, but
it's a tragedy.

28:22.908 --> 28:25.496
- So this is not a
new phenomenon?

28:28.499 --> 28:30.408
- There was a theory proposed,

28:30.432 --> 28:32.583
that maybe there are apex
predators we haven't

28:32.607 --> 28:33.607
identified yet.

28:36.784 --> 28:38.762
- My wife's.

28:38.786 --> 28:41.212
- I though Lucy
was a journalist?

28:41.236 --> 28:43.801
- Lucy and I aren't married.

28:43.825 --> 28:47.898
My wife, Rachel. She was a
Marine Biologist like me.

28:52.696 --> 28:55.813
- Four years ago she
was lost at sea.

28:55.837 --> 29:01.992
We found her research boat
adrift with no aboard.

29:02.016 --> 29:03.016
- I'm sorry, Sam.

29:04.604 --> 29:08.653
- Yeah, she died doing
what she loved.

29:08.677 --> 29:12.830
That's the one thing I
keep telling myself.

29:12.854 --> 29:15.443
It's like the only way I can...

29:19.861 --> 29:23.002
- I lost someone, too.
So I understand.

29:27.455 --> 29:29.181
There you go. Four stitches.

29:30.665 --> 29:34.507
I'm no plastic surgeon, so
you may end up with a scar.

29:34.531 --> 29:36.371
- I'm lucky you happened
to be on the island.

29:36.395 --> 29:39.684
- Well, I would love to
get off this island.

29:39.708 --> 29:42.135
What if the ferry doesn't come?

29:42.159 --> 29:43.999
- We all descend into
mass cannibalism.

29:44.023 --> 29:46.277
- No, listen. I'm serious.

29:46.301 --> 29:48.521
Look at them, they're
scared and they're at each

29:48.545 --> 29:49.867
others throats.

29:49.891 --> 29:52.031
Who's gonna keep order?

29:53.895 --> 29:56.701
- Uh, Sam. There's a problem
down in the dock and

29:56.725 --> 29:58.624
they need you.

30:02.352 --> 30:06.252
- Yeah. Only problem is
there's no sign of Emmett.

30:07.357 --> 30:09.680
I found it on the
shores over there.

30:09.704 --> 30:12.579
Radioed Lars and Author. We
went searching on the water

30:12.603 --> 30:18.206
but we couldn't find any sign
of Emmett or his body anywhere.

30:18.230 --> 30:20.484
- The day he left, Jess
packed him a sandwich,

30:20.508 --> 30:23.521
it's still in his duffle bag.
He never ate it.

30:23.545 --> 30:26.904
I don't think he ever
made it to the mainland.

30:26.928 --> 30:29.413
Knocked him down.

30:30.414 --> 30:33.417
- Sam. There's blood here.

30:37.697 --> 30:38.985
- He went overboard.

30:39.009 --> 30:41.436
- Yeah. It's what it looks like.

30:41.460 --> 30:44.888
Trouble is, the morning Emmett
left, the water was glass.

30:44.912 --> 30:45.913
There were no waves.

30:50.227 --> 30:53.034
- I don't know.

30:53.058 --> 30:59.074
Looks organic. Smells organic.

30:59.098 --> 31:00.386
It's like the sea.

31:00.410 --> 31:02.906
- He was such a smart kid.

31:02.930 --> 31:05.770
Lived his life on the water.
I don't understand it,

31:05.794 --> 31:08.221
how could he- how could
he go overboard?

31:08.245 --> 31:11.293
- The ocean takes ever
the careful ones.

31:11.317 --> 31:13.423
Oh, Jesse.

31:48.458 --> 31:51.161
- So Emmett never made
it to the mainland.

31:51.185 --> 31:54.129
And we still don' know
where the damn ferry is.

31:54.153 --> 31:56.166
- Well there's gotta be
a logical explanation.

31:56.190 --> 31:59.445
- You keep saying, Sam. But
what is the explanation?

31:59.469 --> 32:01.965
Why isn't anyone
tryin' to reach us?

32:01.989 --> 32:03.863
Has the whole world
forgotten we're here?

32:03.887 --> 32:07.315
- Someone needs to go across and
find out what the problem is.

32:07.339 --> 32:09.869
- Emmett already tried,
look what happened.

32:09.893 --> 32:12.354
- Look, my generator's dead.
My power's off.

32:12.378 --> 32:14.529
If you're goin'
Lars, I comin' too.

32:14.553 --> 32:16.513
- My kids and I are comin', too.
We've had enough.

32:16.537 --> 32:18.809
- Hold on, then. My
boat's no big enough.

32:18.833 --> 32:21.087
- Well I got enough fuel
to get across the water,

32:21.111 --> 32:23.193
I can carry some of you.

32:23.217 --> 32:25.333
But Lars, you and I
should go out together.

32:25.357 --> 32:28.198
Keep an eye on each
other, in case one of us

32:28.222 --> 32:29.568
get's into trouble.

32:31.052 --> 32:33.375
- Lee's runnin' out of his heart pill.
He needs to go.

32:33.399 --> 32:36.137
- I called dibs first.
- People! People!

32:36.161 --> 32:39.140
We can't fit the whole
island in two boats.

32:39.164 --> 32:41.521
Some of you are gonna
have to stay here.

32:41.545 --> 32:43.892
- Why don't you all
just draw lots?

32:45.515 --> 32:47.182
It's the only fair thing to do.

32:47.206 --> 32:49.667
There's gotta be priorities.

32:49.691 --> 32:52.015
Sick folks, first. Then
woman and children.

32:52.039 --> 32:54.041
The Titanic?

32:56.146 --> 32:57.882
I need to get off
this island, too.

32:57.906 --> 32:59.988
- Not more than my children do.

33:00.012 --> 33:02.818
- If you want to go to the
mainland, be on the pier

33:02.842 --> 33:06.846
at 3 o'clock. We'll figure out
then who gets to go on board.

33:13.232 --> 33:15.866
- Looks like there won't
be any room for us.

33:15.890 --> 33:18.213
- Well, let me check with Arthur.
His boat's up

33:18.237 --> 33:20.117
on the north shore. Maybe
he can get you across.

33:39.603 --> 33:41.433
- At least I can count on you.

33:44.953 --> 33:45.954
- I'm not trying to-

35:14.905 --> 35:17.194
- We'll be okay, Ellie.

35:17.218 --> 35:20.266
Whatever happens between
me and Lucy, you and I...

35:20.290 --> 35:24.156
we'll manage. Just
the two of us.

35:28.056 --> 35:32.175
- No. No.

35:32.199 --> 35:34.832
- This is between me and Lucy.

35:34.856 --> 35:38.032
If anyone's at fault, it's me.

35:44.107 --> 35:46.223
- She say's that's
all you think about.

35:46.247 --> 35:49.468
"Where are the fish?" Dad, who
cares about the stupid fish?

35:49.492 --> 35:51.021
No one but you.

35:51.045 --> 35:53.047
- Your mom did.

35:56.430 --> 35:58.390
You know, when you were six
years old, we took you

35:58.414 --> 36:02.412
to the Boston Aquarium,
and you wouldn't leave.

36:02.436 --> 36:04.724
You stuck to that jellyfish
tank tighter than a limpet.

36:04.748 --> 36:07.337
- Yeah.

36:09.891 --> 36:13.526
- We stayed there three hours.
The truth is you mom didn't

36:13.550 --> 36:18.255
want to leave you there. She
was like a fish, herself.

36:18.279 --> 36:20.385
Never happy out of water.

36:25.769 --> 36:27.357
She would have loved it here.

36:30.533 --> 36:33.546
- Not like Lucy.

36:33.570 --> 36:34.570
- No.

36:36.470 --> 36:37.470
Lucy's different.

36:39.887 --> 36:42.624
You can wait here? I'm just
gonna go talk to Arthur.

36:42.648 --> 36:44.271
And I'll be right back.

37:01.943 --> 37:02.944
- Arthur!

37:07.846 --> 37:10.849
Arthur! Arthur! You in there?

38:08.493 --> 38:10.022
- Jesus!

38:10.046 --> 38:11.703
- Ugh. Dinner.

38:12.980 --> 38:16.511
- I'm guessing his
last meal was dinner.

38:16.535 --> 38:19.307
Specifically pork and beans.

38:19.331 --> 38:22.483
I can see the remains here in
the stomach which would place

38:22.507 --> 38:26.141
time of death some
time last evening.

38:26.165 --> 38:28.143
Would have been soon after
he ate because this is

38:28.167 --> 38:31.388
- still pretty much undigested.
- Jesus.

38:31.412 --> 38:34.391
- You're a biologist. Haven't
you dissected animals?

38:34.415 --> 38:38.050
- Yeah, but this animal
shook my hand last week.

38:38.074 --> 38:43.573
- And hello. We have a capsule.

38:43.597 --> 38:49.510
Blue. Arthur was taking Cardizem.
A blue capsule.

38:49.534 --> 38:52.098
- Who the hell would
have done this?

38:52.122 --> 38:55.826
Just sliced him up and
thrown him on the rocks.

38:55.850 --> 38:58.726
I can't imagine anyone on
this island killing Arthur.

38:58.750 --> 39:00.521
- I'm not sure this was murder.

39:00.545 --> 39:04.387
His intestines looked like they
were ripped apart, not sliced.

39:04.411 --> 39:06.389
Do you have any bears
on the island?

39:06.413 --> 39:09.530
- A bear would have to
swim 40 miles to get here.

39:09.554 --> 39:11.186
- What do you think
happened to him?

39:11.210 --> 39:15.018
- I don't know. Clearly
there was a struggle.

39:15.042 --> 39:16.043
There's blood everywhere.

39:19.149 --> 39:21.231
- Let's take a look at
that blue substance.

39:21.255 --> 39:22.439
Where did you find it, again?

39:22.463 --> 39:24.383
- On the axe blade. It
looked like the same stuff

39:24.407 --> 39:25.581
we found on Emmett's boat.

39:42.449 --> 39:45.244
- Blood cells.

39:47.488 --> 39:51.009
- But those are blue. I've
never seen blood that color.

39:52.735 --> 39:57.301
- I have. It's an
adaptation to cold water.

39:57.325 --> 39:59.787
In stead of hemoglobin,
some marine animals

39:59.811 --> 40:01.478
have blood with hemocyanin.

40:01.502 --> 40:03.825
It's copper based. They
could survive sub-freezing

40:03.849 --> 40:05.644
temperatures all the way
down to Antarctica.

40:07.646 --> 40:10.349
- The water. Everyone
should stay off the water!

40:10.373 --> 40:11.493
We need to stop those boats!

40:11.517 --> 40:14.623
- It's too late. Lars and
Reuben left an hour ago.

40:17.587 --> 40:19.486
- Most of the island.

40:24.007 --> 40:26.458
- Tucker island calling Anya.
Anya, are you there? Over.

40:27.528 --> 40:28.771
Lars, are you there?

40:30.842 --> 40:32.602
Lars, are you there?

40:33.569 --> 40:36.340
- They should still
be in radio range.

40:36.364 --> 40:37.918
- Lars, come in. Over.

40:39.471 --> 40:41.631
- Do you really want them to
turn around and come back?

40:41.655 --> 40:43.762
They must be half way
to the mainland by now.

40:43.786 --> 40:45.695
- They need to know what
happened to Arthur.

40:45.719 --> 40:47.524
- We don't know what
happened to Arthur.

40:47.548 --> 40:49.481
Over.

40:55.970 --> 40:58.501
This is Anya. What's up, Val?
Over.

40:58.525 --> 41:02.297
- Lars, it's Sam. You
folks alright out there?

41:02.321 --> 41:05.842
Yeah, we just passed Burdock.
No problems.

41:07.154 --> 41:08.994
His boat's right behind me.

41:09.018 --> 41:11.962
And here's the good news; there's
plenty of fish out here.

41:11.986 --> 41:14.793
My sonar just lit up like Vegas.

41:14.817 --> 41:16.553
- What do you see on sonar?

41:16.577 --> 41:18.555
It looks like a giant
shoal of fish.

41:18.579 --> 41:21.489
Movin' right beneath us.
About 30 meters down.

41:21.513 --> 41:23.826
Big ass echoes.
Could be blue fin.

41:25.724 --> 41:29.739
What else would they be?

41:29.763 --> 41:33.570
- Lars, listen to me.

41:33.594 --> 41:37.401
Get to the shore as
soon as you can.

41:37.425 --> 41:40.853
Just head for the closest
landfall, even if it's just

41:40.877 --> 41:45.651
a pile of rocks. Just get
the folks off the boat.

41:45.675 --> 41:46.997
Why?

41:47.021 --> 41:50.035
- Just get off the water!

41:50.059 --> 41:52.579
Jesus Christ. What
the hell is that?

41:54.097 --> 41:57.560
Hey. Hold on! And don't
let them go over.

41:57.584 --> 41:58.654
Hold on.

42:03.037 --> 42:04.038
- Lars!

42:12.460 --> 42:15.578
- That's it. That's the
last of our diesel.

42:15.602 --> 42:17.293
From now on, we're in the dark.

42:26.613 --> 42:29.799
What happened out there, Sam?

42:29.823 --> 42:31.594
- I don't know.

42:31.618 --> 42:33.418
- You told them to get
off the water, you must

42:33.442 --> 42:36.771
have known something
was going to happen.

42:36.795 --> 42:39.291
- Well, I was guessing. After
what happened to Emmett

42:39.315 --> 42:41.766
and then to Arthur.

42:45.804 --> 42:48.990
You looked at the remains,
what did you see?

42:49.014 --> 42:51.890
- It looks like he was ripped
apart by some sort of animal.

42:51.914 --> 42:54.744
But this happened aboard his boat.
On the water.

42:56.677 --> 42:59.956
- This is straight out
of your research paper.

43:02.925 --> 43:06.801
- I wrote it four years ago
on the collapse of fisheries.

43:06.825 --> 43:09.103
- Tell them the rest, Sam.

43:13.832 --> 43:16.846
- Rachel and I first
saw it happen here.

43:16.870 --> 43:19.642
It was December, four years
ago in Cape Hatteras.

43:19.666 --> 43:22.161
A sudden and drastic
drop off in catches.

43:22.185 --> 43:25.544
We tried to hunt down reasons.
We tested for toxins,

43:25.568 --> 43:27.328
temperature shifts,
and dinoflagellates.

43:28.640 --> 43:31.757
Red tide. We found nothing
to explain it, but it was

43:31.781 --> 43:33.759
clear there was some sort
of marine catastrophe,

43:33.783 --> 43:36.831
everything vanished from
crab to fish to dolphins-

43:36.855 --> 43:39.055
- You said that was the first
time you saw it happen, so

43:39.079 --> 43:40.663
it's happened since then?

43:40.687 --> 43:45.322
- A year later, a colleague in
Dover observed the same thing.

43:45.346 --> 43:48.463
And a year after that, it
happened in Nantucket.

43:48.487 --> 43:51.674
So, we thought it might be
the Gulf stream Phenomenon.

43:51.698 --> 43:53.641
- Maine isn't on
the Gulf stream.

43:53.665 --> 43:57.334
- No, but the Gulf stream and
the Labrador current collide

43:57.358 --> 43:59.854
to create one the richest
fishing grounds in the world,

43:59.878 --> 44:01.131
the gulf of Maine.

44:01.155 --> 44:03.155
And I predicted this is
where it would happen next,

44:03.179 --> 44:04.410
and I was right.

44:04.434 --> 44:06.205
'Cause something's changing.
Something that's causing the

44:06.229 --> 44:07.724
fish population to collapse.

44:07.748 --> 44:09.899
- Like in Delaware
and Nantucket.

44:09.923 --> 44:11.523
- And it turned out
in other places, too.

44:11.547 --> 44:14.835
There've been reports from
the Azores and Cape Verde.

44:14.859 --> 44:16.699
And the pattern is
always the same;

44:16.723 --> 44:19.909
a sudden disappearance of fish,
local economic devastation,

44:19.933 --> 44:21.831
and then the fishermen
start to die.

44:24.765 --> 44:27.813
- Everyone assumed the deaths
were accidents or suicide, but

44:27.837 --> 44:29.263
the bodies were
never found because

44:29.287 --> 44:30.327
it always happened at sea.

44:33.843 --> 44:39.411
Look, you said you had a theory
for what's causing this?

44:39.435 --> 44:43.726
- Rachel believed that there
is a marine predator that we

44:43.750 --> 44:45.762
haven't identified, yet.

44:45.786 --> 44:49.617
It's an apex predator that
migrates with the fish.

44:53.242 --> 44:54.875
Wouldn't somebody
have reported this?

44:54.899 --> 44:58.292
- That's why no one took it
seriously, but Rachel did.

44:58.316 --> 45:00.466
Because she spotted it on
sonar, something that she

45:00.490 --> 45:03.193
couldn't identify. And the day
that she disappeared, she was

45:03.217 --> 45:04.574
out on the water looking for it.

45:04.598 --> 45:06.749
- Lars saw something
on sonar, too.

45:06.773 --> 45:09.268
He said it looked like
a giant shoal of fish.

45:09.292 --> 45:10.777
- Which means there's
more than one.

45:11.881 --> 45:14.653
- Or it's really fucking big.

45:14.677 --> 45:16.921
Oh, my God.

45:30.693 --> 45:32.902
- Not so boring here, after all.

45:34.835 --> 45:37.262
Maybe you should stay
and cover the story.

45:37.286 --> 45:38.943
Like any good journalist.

45:41.014 --> 45:42.014
- Maybe I should.

45:45.259 --> 45:46.927
- For the sake of the story.

45:46.951 --> 45:51.586
- It just turned out to
be right under my nose.

45:51.610 --> 45:54.268
- Captain Aha and
the White Whale.

45:58.031 --> 46:01.286
- It's what you called me once,
Captain Ahab, chasing a monster

46:01.310 --> 46:04.013
that would drag me
under the waves.

46:04.037 --> 46:06.636
And it did.

46:06.660 --> 46:10.698
Cost me my job, brought
us to this rock.

46:12.942 --> 46:17.026
- When I heard you explain
everything tonight,

46:17.050 --> 46:22.790
I finally understood
the obsession.

46:22.814 --> 46:27.036
It's still about
Rachel, isn't it?

46:27.060 --> 46:30.867
You're on this island
because of her.

46:30.891 --> 46:33.111
Because you are compelled
to find this thing

46:33.135 --> 46:35.976
that she was searching for.

46:36.000 --> 46:37.656
This thing that killed her.

46:40.590 --> 46:44.743
- I was never really
quite sure it existed.

46:44.767 --> 46:48.195
But now I know she was right.

46:48.219 --> 46:49.220
I believe her.

46:57.987 --> 46:59.851
- So do I.

47:27.706 --> 47:30.237
- I always despised beans.

47:30.261 --> 47:32.421
- Better learn to like 'em,
Titus, 'cause we're running

47:32.445 --> 47:33.792
out of everything else.

47:33.816 --> 47:37.071
- Do you mind if we bring some
of our supplies over to Nina's?

47:37.095 --> 47:39.936
She told me this morning that
she's running low on food.

47:39.960 --> 47:42.697
- Sure. She can move
in here if she wants.

47:42.721 --> 47:45.804
Ruth and Alvis, too. It might
be smart for us to pull

47:45.828 --> 47:49.221
our resources while we figure
out what the hell is goin' on.

47:49.245 --> 47:50.947
- If this were one
of your novels,

47:50.971 --> 47:52.248
how would you explain it?

47:54.423 --> 47:58.058
- We all wake up and find out
it just was a nightmare.

47:58.082 --> 48:01.302
- Pretty lame for a writer.

48:01.326 --> 48:04.202
Even with that fire goin',
it's gonna get cold in here.

48:04.226 --> 48:05.962
We're gonna need more blankets.

48:05.986 --> 48:06.986
- I'll get 'em.

48:16.065 --> 48:19.044
- I just hope this story
has a happy ending.

48:19.068 --> 48:23.083
- There's no such thing
as a happy ending.

48:23.107 --> 48:26.638
- You're full of sunshine
and light, doctor.

48:26.662 --> 48:29.158
- Well, I've seen
too many endings.

48:29.182 --> 48:32.747
Some are painful,
some are tragic.

48:32.771 --> 48:35.785
None of them are happy.

48:35.809 --> 48:37.431
- That's why I prefer fiction.

48:39.433 --> 48:43.172
- Why come all the way
out here to write?

48:43.196 --> 48:44.196
- 'Cause-

48:50.030 --> 48:52.836
My book takes place
on and island,

48:52.860 --> 48:56.806
and I wanted authenticity.

48:56.830 --> 49:01.500
Pulled out a map, searched
the Maine cost for the most

49:01.524 --> 49:05.884
remote island I could
find, and this was it.

49:05.908 --> 49:09.612
Island Zero.

49:09.636 --> 49:15.159
It's uh... It's my title.

49:18.127 --> 49:22.211
- The island where all
things can be rebooted.

49:22.235 --> 49:24.720
New lives, new relationships.

49:30.346 --> 49:32.417
New possibilities.

50:37.655 --> 50:40.278
I got about a weeks worth
of pork and beans for you.

50:56.018 --> 50:57.018
Nina?

51:05.752 --> 51:06.994
Nina?

51:07.788 --> 51:10.412
I brought a weeks worth of
pork and beans for you.

51:14.312 --> 51:15.312
Nina?

51:40.269 --> 51:42.247
What the hell did that to her?

51:42.271 --> 51:43.272
- Ruth and Alvis.

51:50.062 --> 51:51.222
- Stay in the car!
- But, Dad.

51:51.246 --> 51:53.362
- Stay with Jesse. Both of
you just stay in the car.

51:53.386 --> 51:54.386
- But, Dad.

53:05.458 --> 53:07.391
- Well you could've
knocked, first.

53:09.531 --> 53:14.443
Alvis ain't up to speed but
I'm doin' fine, considering.

53:14.467 --> 53:16.262
Sounds like a bear hibernating.

53:17.711 --> 53:19.931
82 degrees in here and he
needs all them blankets.

53:19.955 --> 53:21.415
- Ruth! You can't stay here.

53:21.439 --> 53:23.383
You and Alvis need to leave
the house right now.

53:23.407 --> 53:24.867
Where we goin'?

53:24.891 --> 53:27.421
- To the inn. Everyone on the
island needs to stay together.

53:27.445 --> 53:30.217
- Go back to the truck, Ellie!

53:30.241 --> 53:33.358
Ruth, Nina's dead.

53:33.382 --> 53:35.622
Something got into her house,
smashed through the window.

53:35.646 --> 53:38.270
- Dad, I need to
show you something.

53:44.013 --> 53:46.544
- Ellie recording this a
couple of nights ago.

53:46.568 --> 53:49.271
And it happened at the waters
edge right behind our house.

53:49.295 --> 53:51.652
- Why are we only hearing
of this video now?

53:51.676 --> 53:54.310
- 'Cause it was her Christmas
present, she wasn't supposed

53:54.334 --> 53:55.404
to be using it.

53:56.785 --> 54:00.005
- It's a thermographic camera,
the images come from infrared

54:00.029 --> 54:02.456
radiation. You can see
temperature differences

54:02.480 --> 54:05.321
as little as .07
degrees celsius.

54:05.345 --> 54:07.012
- Definitely your kid.

54:07.036 --> 54:08.290
- Here.

54:08.314 --> 54:10.039
This is when it happens.

54:16.045 --> 54:20.302
- Could be a bear, or a cougar.

54:20.326 --> 54:21.326
- No.

54:22.707 --> 54:26.342
So on this camera, cold
temperatures are blue

54:26.366 --> 54:29.507
the warm temperatures are orange.
Play it again, Ellie.

54:32.855 --> 54:36.041
Look what attacks the
deer, what color it is.

54:36.065 --> 54:40.011
- It's cold blooded. Amphibian?

54:40.035 --> 54:43.186
- I mean, possibly. But,
even octopuses come out

54:43.210 --> 54:46.362
of the water to hunt. They could
stay out for as long as an hour.

54:46.386 --> 54:53.196
- So this is what killed
Arthur and Nina and Emmett.

54:53.220 --> 54:57.166
- It's cold blooded, and
it came from the water.

54:57.190 --> 55:00.376
- How far is Nina's
house from the water?

55:00.400 --> 55:01.401
- About a hundred yards.

55:10.030 --> 55:11.825
- We're closer than
that right now.

55:27.013 --> 55:28.370
- How'd you learn to do that?

55:28.394 --> 55:30.406
Take apart guns?

55:30.430 --> 55:33.468
- I've spent some
time around weapons.

55:35.780 --> 55:38.552
- In a way.

55:38.576 --> 55:40.347
- Lucy won't let
me near any guns.

55:40.371 --> 55:41.371
- Good for her.

55:47.792 --> 55:50.668
This pistol's worthless, but
the rifle and shotgun seem

55:50.692 --> 55:52.083
to be in working order.

55:52.107 --> 55:53.947
Are there any other
weapons on the island?

55:53.971 --> 55:56.432
- Between me and Alvis,
that's all we've got.

55:56.456 --> 55:59.573
What about ammo? There's only
four bullets for the rifle.

55:59.597 --> 56:03.508
- Arthur used to hunt. Maybe
there something at his house.

56:03.532 --> 56:05.407
- I better get over there
before it gets dark.

56:05.431 --> 56:08.434
- You shouldn't be out there alone.
I'll go with you.

56:52.478 --> 56:54.663
- If this creature
really exists,

56:54.687 --> 56:56.319
why hasn't anyone reported it?

56:56.343 --> 56:58.736
- Well new breed of species
are discovered all the time.

56:58.760 --> 57:01.014
- Well were talking about
something that can rip

57:01.038 --> 57:03.844
a man apart. One of these
must've washed on the shore,

57:03.868 --> 57:06.813
somewhere. - Not necessarily.

57:06.837 --> 57:10.288
Could be like whale fall.

57:12.187 --> 57:14.855
- Well when a whale dies at
sea, it doesn't wash on shore.

57:14.879 --> 57:16.512
It sinks.

57:16.536 --> 57:18.825
And there carcasses can
end up on abyssal zone

57:18.849 --> 57:23.346
five-six thousand feet down.

57:23.370 --> 57:26.798
Where a complex ecosystem
feeds on the corpse.

57:26.822 --> 57:28.593
The deep sea bed
is just littered

57:28.617 --> 57:34.288
with the bones of whales,
and who knows what else.

57:34.312 --> 57:35.659
- Found some.

57:57.197 --> 58:00.660
- Here, look at this.

58:00.684 --> 58:02.696
- Don't run down the
battery, Ellie.

58:02.720 --> 58:04.550
- I'm just showing
him how to use it.

58:08.864 --> 58:12.085
- I've never been
good at roughing it.

58:12.109 --> 58:17.331
I hate camping. Can't stand the ocean.
I always get sea sick.

58:17.355 --> 58:19.565
- How did you end up
with a marine biologist?

58:22.188 --> 58:24.546
- I interviewed him for
a Father's Day story

58:24.570 --> 58:28.228
on single dads. One
thing led to another.

58:30.576 --> 58:35.557
- No, Rachel had died
two years before.

58:35.581 --> 58:39.181
Sam says Ellie looks
just like her.

58:39.205 --> 58:43.357
It's like Rachel's ghost
is always with us.

58:43.381 --> 58:46.568
How can I compete with that?

58:46.592 --> 58:48.248
- Now why do you
have to compete?

58:51.286 --> 58:53.567
- You can spot animals that
you'd never see with a regular

58:53.591 --> 58:54.591
camera.

58:56.740 --> 58:58.787
See that orange thing
up in the branches?

58:58.811 --> 59:00.709
I think it might be a squirrel.

59:02.573 --> 59:04.689
- So how long does the
battery last on this thing?

59:04.713 --> 59:08.579
- I charged it up yesterday,
plus I have a spare battery.

59:10.961 --> 59:14.896
Even when it's pitch black
outside, you could still see-

59:15.655 --> 59:18.762
Kid. What is it?

59:20.142 --> 59:21.464
- There's something coming.

59:21.488 --> 59:24.112
- Oh, my God.

59:40.646 --> 59:42.820
Where is it? Why
can't we see it?

01:00:21.307 --> 01:00:24.621
- They'll be back.

01:01:14.084 --> 01:01:15.717
- This is it.

01:01:15.741 --> 01:01:19.883
This house is about as far
from the water as we can get.

01:01:21.781 --> 01:01:25.865
The McCarty's. After their kid
drowned they left the island.

01:01:25.889 --> 01:01:27.545
Never came back.

01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:39.280
- A girl.

01:01:51.777 --> 01:01:54.400
The others are already
headed up the hill.

01:01:56.402 --> 01:01:57.437
Titus?

01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:20.529
Titus?

01:03:05.195 --> 01:03:09.865
Down at the inn, you
said they'll be back.

01:03:09.889 --> 01:03:12.488
Like you already know
what's gonna to happen.

01:03:12.512 --> 01:03:14.998
Have you seen one of
these things before?

01:03:17.517 --> 01:03:20.175
- I didn't see it, exactly.

01:03:22.074 --> 01:03:23.741
But I've seen what they do.

01:03:23.765 --> 01:03:27.745
When?

01:03:27.769 --> 01:03:33.993
- It was on a freighter, in the Pacific.
The Dundee.

01:03:34.017 --> 01:03:38.549
We were in the middle of nowhere.
The dolphins had been

01:03:38.573 --> 01:03:41.863
followin' us for days.

01:03:41.887 --> 01:03:47.040
Then, they vanished.
The sea went calm.

01:03:47.064 --> 01:03:50.930
We lost Bill the first
night, on night watch.

01:03:53.933 --> 01:03:58.880
Nobody saw him go overboard, he
was just gone the next morning.

01:03:58.904 --> 01:04:05.093
The next night, Jake was gone.

01:04:05.117 --> 01:04:06.463
On the third ni-

01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:10.639
On the third nigh-

01:04:13.021 --> 01:04:14.885
- What happened on
the third night?

01:04:19.407 --> 01:04:23.525
- I was in the engine
room, on duty.

01:04:23.549 --> 01:04:28.116
When I heard the gunfire, I
thought there had been pirates

01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:30.635
attacking us. Huh!

01:04:30.659 --> 01:04:36.400
When I got up on deck,
there was no one left.

01:04:36.424 --> 01:04:42.061
Blood everywhere, on the
bridge, the galley,

01:04:42.085 --> 01:04:44.570
the crewmen's quarters.

01:04:47.331 --> 01:04:52.588
12 men gone. I was
the only one left.

01:04:52.612 --> 01:04:56.409
- You said you saw it, Alvis.
What did you see?

01:04:59.136 --> 01:05:04.083
- Just on deck, a shimmer,

01:05:04.107 --> 01:05:08.052
like T.V. static?

01:05:08.076 --> 01:05:09.698
Like shimmering.

01:05:13.185 --> 01:05:16.992
Then I heard the Navy
copter coming in,

01:05:17.016 --> 01:05:22.101
answering our distress call.

01:05:22.125 --> 01:05:26.139
The Navy asked me
what had happened.

01:05:26.163 --> 01:05:28.314
I couldn't tell 'em.

01:05:28.338 --> 01:05:33.343
I didn't know. That
was 30 years ago.

01:05:37.036 --> 01:05:39.487
- There should be enough there
to tie us over for a few days.

01:05:42.352 --> 01:05:44.192
- I thought she was with you.

01:05:44.216 --> 01:05:46.435
- I didn't see her, I
though she came with you.

01:05:46.459 --> 01:05:47.459
- I'll go look for her.

01:05:49.014 --> 01:05:52.120
I'm the one who screwed up.
I'll go with you.

01:05:53.915 --> 01:05:55.686
I'll take the shotgun.

01:05:55.710 --> 01:05:57.826
- No, there gonna
need a weapon here.

01:05:57.850 --> 01:06:02.313
You can take the camera. Just
watch for anything coming at us.

01:06:02.337 --> 01:06:04.143
'Cause it's the only
way we'll see them.

01:06:04.167 --> 01:06:06.376
- Yeah. Yeah, okay.

01:06:09.206 --> 01:06:12.209
- Be careful.
- I'll hold down the fort.

01:06:59.118 --> 01:07:01.810
There's nothing. It's clear.

01:07:22.728 --> 01:07:23.729
- Oh, shit!

01:07:24.557 --> 01:07:28.123
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It was a mouse.

01:07:28.147 --> 01:07:30.080
- They oughta call the
health department.

01:07:51.274 --> 01:07:52.275
- Blood.

01:08:04.804 --> 01:08:08.336
What do you see in there?
Anything?

01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:10.120
- Nope. It's clear.

01:09:36.930 --> 01:09:39.220
- He killed Jesse.

01:09:39.243 --> 01:09:42.706
And left her hanging on
the porch, like bait.

01:09:42.729 --> 01:09:44.801
And they gutted her.

01:09:46.906 --> 01:09:47.906
Why?

01:09:49.115 --> 01:09:50.886
What are you really
doing on this island?

01:09:50.910 --> 01:09:52.750
- He's got it password
protected, Dad.

01:09:52.774 --> 01:09:53.948
I can't get into it.

01:09:55.271 --> 01:09:56.271
- Guess.

01:09:56.295 --> 01:09:58.929
!

01:09:58.953 --> 01:10:00.344
- You might want to cooperate.

01:10:00.368 --> 01:10:03.554
You'll shoot me?

01:10:03.578 --> 01:10:05.625
What about the hippocratic oath?
You're a doctor.

01:10:05.649 --> 01:10:08.411
You know what's good
about being a doctor?

01:10:09.412 --> 01:10:13.771
After I shoot you, I can keep
you from bleeding to death.

01:10:13.795 --> 01:10:17.706
A well placed tourniquet
should do it.

01:10:17.730 --> 01:10:21.123
- Stop, for God's sake.
What are you doing?

01:10:21.147 --> 01:10:23.367
You Alvis?

01:10:23.391 --> 01:10:25.290
- Got no problem.

01:10:27.188 --> 01:10:31.444
- You didn't see Jesse's body,
and what they did to her.

01:10:31.468 --> 01:10:36.853
And what he did to her.
And I need to know why.

01:10:39.407 --> 01:10:40.833
- Okay, Ellie. Go
to the bedroom.

01:10:40.857 --> 01:10:43.249
- But, Lucy.
- Just go, please.

01:10:43.273 --> 01:10:44.447
Shut the door.

01:10:47.312 --> 01:10:49.945
- Say good-bye to procreation.

01:10:49.969 --> 01:10:52.489
Palmyra415.

01:10:53.628 --> 01:10:54.698
- No caps.

01:11:00.773 --> 01:11:03.259
- Isn't that the
name of his novel?

01:11:06.848 --> 01:11:10.966
- This isn't a novel. This
is a scientific report.

01:11:10.990 --> 01:11:15.523
"Sudden drop in fish stocks,
next event expected at latitude

01:11:15.547 --> 01:11:19.827
43.76, Island Zero".

01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:28.800
- You are.

01:11:31.148 --> 01:11:35.508
We are. This place, this rock.

01:11:35.532 --> 01:11:40.858
We're sitting at ground
zero for the invasion.

01:11:40.882 --> 01:11:43.827
I was hoping I would be
miles away by now, but

01:11:43.851 --> 01:11:45.725
things coalesced
faster than expected.

01:11:45.749 --> 01:11:47.693
- You knew what
was gonna happen.

01:11:47.717 --> 01:11:49.902
You knew people
would start dying.

01:11:49.926 --> 01:11:53.077
- I couldn't be certain,
but the data was there.

01:11:53.101 --> 01:11:56.633
- Your late wife's date,

01:11:56.657 --> 01:11:58.831
as a matter of fact.

01:12:02.007 --> 01:12:04.365
Four years ago, when she
brought up the possibility of

01:12:04.389 --> 01:12:07.575
an unidentified apex predator,
most people laughed.

01:12:07.599 --> 01:12:10.267
Some of us didn't because
we have been monitoring

01:12:10.291 --> 01:12:12.476
these instances for decades.

01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:15.755
Did you never wonder why your
research funding was yanked

01:12:15.779 --> 01:12:16.779
so precipitously?

01:12:18.506 --> 01:12:22.590
- Because we knew too much.
We had to be silenced.

01:12:22.614 --> 01:12:25.834
- This is a new species.

01:12:25.858 --> 01:12:29.044
A major scientific discovery.

01:12:29.068 --> 01:12:31.485
It should be shared
with the world.

01:12:34.073 --> 01:12:35.361
- It's the journalist talking.

01:12:35.385 --> 01:12:36.742
- Why would you
keep it a secret?

01:12:36.766 --> 01:12:39.710
- Because it's exploitable.
Right, Titus?

01:12:39.734 --> 01:12:41.540
You want it for yourselves.

01:12:41.564 --> 01:12:44.612
Oh, I know how you people think.

01:12:44.636 --> 01:12:47.408
These creatures can't be
detected with the naked eye.

01:12:47.432 --> 01:12:51.619
On sonar? They just look like
a harmless school of tuna.

01:12:51.643 --> 01:12:55.277
They're amphibious
killing, eating machines.

01:12:55.301 --> 01:12:58.591
Gee. Who might be
interested in that?

01:12:58.615 --> 01:13:00.524
- The military.

01:13:00.548 --> 01:13:04.597
- You were military, weren't
you, Doctor Barrow?

01:13:04.621 --> 01:13:06.427
I can always spot an ex-soldier.

01:13:06.451 --> 01:13:09.395
That's why you're so
comfortable around fire arms.

01:13:09.419 --> 01:13:13.951
Did you serve in Iraq
or in Afghanistan?

01:13:13.975 --> 01:13:15.228
- Both.

01:13:15.252 --> 01:13:19.060
- So, and you know what
war does to human bodies?

01:13:19.084 --> 01:13:22.788
- That's why I left. I got sick
of seeing soldiers ripped apart.

01:13:22.812 --> 01:13:25.825
- That is exactly why
we need these creatures

01:13:25.849 --> 01:13:29.163
on our side, working with us.

01:13:31.165 --> 01:13:33.557
Problem is, you may have
destroyed any chance

01:13:33.581 --> 01:13:36.111
to negotiate with them because
you went and fucking shot one.

01:13:36.135 --> 01:13:39.460
- That thing ripped Val apart,

01:13:39.484 --> 01:13:41.738
You think we are gonna
to negotiate with them?

01:13:41.762 --> 01:13:43.809
- We're making first contact
with an intelligent

01:13:43.833 --> 01:13:47.502
marine species. My job
is to be the diplomat.

01:13:47.526 --> 01:13:52.265
We cannot kill any of them.

01:13:52.289 --> 01:13:55.223
Do you all understand that?
Do you?

01:14:01.851 --> 01:14:03.863
- They're not fish.

01:14:03.887 --> 01:14:08.143
They have a complexed language,
and social structure.

01:14:08.167 --> 01:14:10.525
They hunt cooperatively.

01:14:10.549 --> 01:14:14.495
Their brains are every bit as
large and neurologically complex

01:14:14.519 --> 01:14:17.670
as ours. And their use
of echolocation is beyo-

01:14:17.694 --> 01:14:20.639
- You ca- You cannot
possibly know

01:14:20.663 --> 01:14:22.319
this much about them.

01:14:23.389 --> 01:14:25.506
Unless you have
one in captivity.

01:14:25.530 --> 01:14:29.889
- We caught one. Nine years
ago, after an oil spill,

01:14:29.913 --> 01:14:31.615
in the Gulf of Mexico.

01:14:31.639 --> 01:14:34.998
It was sick, it was unable
to camouflage itself.

01:14:35.022 --> 01:14:38.139
After that discovery, we went
looking for more of them.

01:14:38.163 --> 01:14:41.867
Captured another one,
uhh, off the Carolina's.

01:14:41.891 --> 01:14:44.732
Third of Cape Hatteras.

01:14:44.756 --> 01:14:48.667
Like so many other species,
they're migrating northward.

01:14:48.691 --> 01:14:49.909
- It's climate change.

01:14:49.933 --> 01:14:52.981
- Rising temperatures and
over fishing has caused them

01:14:53.005 --> 01:14:55.674
to move northward
in search of food,

01:14:55.698 --> 01:14:58.539
which has brought
them right here,

01:14:58.563 --> 01:15:00.748
to the world's richest
fishing waters.

01:15:00.772 --> 01:15:03.440
- Island Zero.

01:15:03.464 --> 01:15:05.511
Where it all begins.

01:15:05.535 --> 01:15:09.757
- People live here. You
can't keep this a secret.

01:15:09.781 --> 01:15:11.552
- They can keep
anything a secret.

01:15:11.576 --> 01:15:17.212
- All them people dead. And
we're next, aren't we?

01:15:17.236 --> 01:15:20.561
Damn you! Goddamn you!

01:15:20.585 --> 01:15:23.080
- Don't!
- Dad! Their coming!

01:15:23.104 --> 01:15:24.761
A lot of them!

01:15:36.773 --> 01:15:38.223
- Oh, my God!

01:15:45.955 --> 01:15:46.955
- Cut me loose!

01:15:48.578 --> 01:15:49.590
You need me, Sam!

01:15:49.614 --> 01:15:50.936
- You, shut up!

01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:52.880
- You're all gonna die if
you don't listen to me!

01:15:52.904 --> 01:15:54.664
I can negotiate with them!

01:15:55.274 --> 01:15:56.631
You have to let me go!

01:15:56.655 --> 01:15:59.427
- Only 'agotiations gonna
be with this here shotgun!

01:15:59.451 --> 01:16:01.936
- If you kill one of them,
you kill all of us!

01:16:04.352 --> 01:16:07.114
You have to let me go!
I can talk to them!

01:16:32.139 --> 01:16:33.668
- They're in the basement.

01:16:33.692 --> 01:16:34.945
- I don't know how they got it.

01:16:34.969 --> 01:16:36.039
- Dad!

01:16:51.192 --> 01:16:52.653
- Don't shoot it!

01:16:52.677 --> 01:16:55.541
For God's sake. Let
me talk to them!

01:16:56.646 --> 01:16:58.579
- Start talking.
- I need my laptop.

01:16:59.684 --> 01:17:00.684
- Cut me loose!

01:17:08.658 --> 01:17:09.797
- Here, here, here!

01:17:15.251 --> 01:17:17.702
- Talk now, Titus, or I'm
pulling the trigger.

01:17:24.087 --> 01:17:26.207
- We've been studying their
language for years, and we

01:17:26.231 --> 01:17:27.336
think this means "hello."

01:17:28.229 --> 01:17:30.345
- We're not entirely sure.

01:17:30.369 --> 01:17:34.142
- So you might be telling him
his mom wears army boots.

01:17:34.166 --> 01:17:37.687
- It stopped. It's thinking.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.727
It's working. It's
not attacking.

01:17:47.352 --> 01:17:49.043
- Negotiations begin.

01:17:50.907 --> 01:17:53.185
[computer imitates
monster noise]

01:17:54.436 --> 01:17:55.716
- What are you
telling it, Titus?

01:17:55.740 --> 01:17:59.340
[computer imitates
monster noise]

01:17:59.364 --> 01:18:00.997
- What the hell are
you telling it?

01:18:01.021 --> 01:18:03.023
[computer imitates
monster noise]

01:18:07.268 --> 01:18:09.384
- What the hell are
you telling it?

01:18:09.408 --> 01:18:11.894
- I think he just told
them "dinner is served."

01:18:14.206 --> 01:18:15.425
And we're dinner.

01:18:15.449 --> 01:18:17.599
- The attic. Get to the attic!

01:18:17.623 --> 01:18:18.623
Ellie!

01:18:23.975 --> 01:18:26.367
- Alvis. Alvis come with us!

01:18:26.391 --> 01:18:27.391
Alvis!

01:18:28.427 --> 01:18:30.084
- Ruth, go! Go!

01:18:30.982 --> 01:18:32.949
- Dad, there's one
right behind you!

01:18:43.891 --> 01:18:45.800
- I'm a friend!

01:18:45.824 --> 01:18:47.826
[computer imitates
monster noise]

01:18:49.794 --> 01:18:50.794
- Don't attack!

01:18:55.938 --> 01:18:57.180
- Don't attack!

01:18:58.595 --> 01:19:00.563
- Don't attack!

01:19:01.357 --> 01:19:04.463
I'm a friend!

01:19:06.949 --> 01:19:09.158
I'm a friend!

01:19:43.192 --> 01:19:44.607
- I don't know.

01:19:45.850 --> 01:19:47.990
- We have no food
or water in here.

01:19:49.370 --> 01:19:53.823
All we have to do is wait
and starve ourselves.

01:19:57.758 --> 01:19:58.828
- Hey, it's me!

01:19:59.875 --> 01:20:00.875
- Open up!

01:20:00.899 --> 01:20:03.902
- Oh, my God. It's Alvis!
It's Alvis!

01:20:18.054 --> 01:20:22.690
Damn old fool! I
thought I lost you!

01:20:22.714 --> 01:20:25.372
Ohh! I thought you were dead!

01:20:29.721 --> 01:20:31.354
- He is there!

01:20:31.378 --> 01:20:33.449
And there!

01:20:37.177 --> 01:20:38.972
- Well they take their
dead with them.

01:20:41.595 --> 01:20:42.917
Why didn't they attack him?

01:20:42.941 --> 01:20:45.841
- Probably 'cause his
hide's too damn tough.

01:20:47.118 --> 01:20:48.440
Would you want to eat him?

01:20:48.464 --> 01:20:51.087
- Sam, come up and
take a look at this!

01:20:57.231 --> 01:21:00.072
Look at the skin on this thing.

01:21:00.096 --> 01:21:02.305
It's shiny, almost reflective.

01:21:05.067 --> 01:21:09.254
- Some kind of protective armor?

01:21:09.278 --> 01:21:12.740
- This skin isn't for
protection, it's for bending

01:21:12.764 --> 01:21:15.018
and refracting light.

01:21:15.042 --> 01:21:16.722
The military is trying
to develop something

01:21:16.746 --> 01:21:17.816
just like this.

01:21:20.461 --> 01:21:22.498
- That's why we can't see them.

01:21:24.672 --> 01:21:27.134
In stead of changing the
color of it's skin,

01:21:27.158 --> 01:21:29.791
like a chameleon or octopus,

01:21:29.815 --> 01:21:32.380
these things have evolved a
completely different way

01:21:32.404 --> 01:21:33.934
to disappear.

01:21:33.958 --> 01:21:37.661
- Prey would never
see it coming.

01:21:37.685 --> 01:21:40.378
The ultimate advantage
for a predator.

01:21:47.972 --> 01:21:49.950
- Dad, my camera battery
is almost dead.

01:21:49.974 --> 01:21:51.089
- Shut it down.

01:21:51.113 --> 01:21:52.593
- We won't be able
to see them coming.

01:21:54.116 --> 01:21:56.163
- Then we'll just have
to keep them out.

01:21:56.187 --> 01:21:58.959
And we'll reinforce
the boards again.

01:21:58.983 --> 01:22:01.478
We stay here and starve?

01:22:01.502 --> 01:22:03.170
- Well at least we
won't freeze to death.

01:22:03.194 --> 01:22:04.678
Got all that wood to burn.

01:22:07.681 --> 01:22:12.179
- Heat. That's it.

01:22:12.203 --> 01:22:13.790
That must be it.

01:22:15.275 --> 01:22:17.943
- The reason Alvis
is still alive.

01:22:17.967 --> 01:22:21.878
He stayed near the stove.

01:22:21.902 --> 01:22:23.431
And they can't tolerate heat.

01:22:23.455 --> 01:22:25.871
- And that's why they're moving
north like the other species.

01:22:30.876 --> 01:22:31.876
- Huh.

01:22:35.019 --> 01:22:37.031
- You were the only
survivor on that cargo ship

01:22:37.055 --> 01:22:40.690
because you were in
a hot engine room.

01:22:40.714 --> 01:22:43.141
- According to this research,
the creatures are attracted to

01:22:43.165 --> 01:22:46.213
noise and to light.

01:22:46.237 --> 01:22:50.148
There's no mention of heat, or
any specific temperature that

01:22:50.172 --> 01:22:51.172
repels them.

01:22:55.384 --> 01:22:57.938
- 82 degrees.

01:23:05.704 --> 01:23:08.984
'Cause that's how we set
the thermostat at home.

01:23:10.054 --> 01:23:12.032
They didn't come to our house.

01:23:12.056 --> 01:23:14.575
They went to Nina's instead.

01:23:16.163 --> 01:23:18.210
- So we're gonna
heat the place up.

01:23:18.234 --> 01:23:20.488
We're gonna get it
nice and toasty.

01:23:20.512 --> 01:23:22.042
And keep it warm in here.

01:23:22.066 --> 01:23:24.665
Keep 'em at bay until
someone rescues us.

01:23:24.689 --> 01:23:27.254
- I don't think anyone's
coming to rescue us, Sam.

01:23:27.278 --> 01:23:29.083
It's all here in the report.

01:23:29.107 --> 01:23:30.798
Their plans for the island.

01:23:34.354 --> 01:23:39.014
- Isolate. Quarantine.
- And eliminate.

01:23:40.601 --> 01:23:44.271
- I thought they wanted
these creatures alive?

01:23:44.295 --> 01:23:45.720
Why would they kill them?

01:23:45.744 --> 01:23:49.379
- This isn't about the creatures.
It's about us.

01:23:49.403 --> 01:23:52.244
What they have planned for us.

01:23:52.268 --> 01:23:54.177
That's why they cut
off the island.

01:23:54.201 --> 01:23:56.938
The ferry, the phones.

01:23:56.962 --> 01:24:01.288
We're the only ones left
who know what happened.

01:24:01.312 --> 01:24:03.773
Their gonna wait
until we're dead.

01:24:03.797 --> 01:24:06.948
- The world would find out.

01:24:06.972 --> 01:24:08.191
There'd be questions.

01:24:08.215 --> 01:24:09.951
- And they'd have the answers.

01:24:09.975 --> 01:24:13.058
A way to explain
how we all died.

01:24:13.082 --> 01:24:16.061
A fire in the village,
or Sam here went berserk

01:24:16.085 --> 01:24:17.328
and slaughtered us all.

01:24:20.158 --> 01:24:26.106
- If no one's coming
to rescue us then...

01:24:26.130 --> 01:24:27.303
what are we gonna do?

01:24:44.527 --> 01:24:46.160
- Hot.

01:24:46.184 --> 01:24:49.118
I don't like hot.

01:24:54.330 --> 01:24:59.173
You think it's fun
shooting people?

01:24:59.197 --> 01:25:04.144
- I just wondered. I've
never even held a gun.

01:25:04.168 --> 01:25:06.767
Lucy's scared of them, and my dad
says he won't shoot anything

01:25:06.791 --> 01:25:08.355
'cause he's a biologist.

01:25:08.379 --> 01:25:11.703
- A gun is a tool,
Ellie, that's all.

01:25:11.727 --> 01:25:18.320
Like a chainsaw, someone could
get hurt if your careless.

01:25:20.667 --> 01:25:23.059
I'm not careless.

01:25:23.083 --> 01:25:26.742
- Would you really have shot
Titus in the you know where?

01:25:28.985 --> 01:25:31.160
- I guess we'll never
know, will we?

01:25:44.208 --> 01:25:45.840
Shouldn't you be sleeping?

01:25:45.864 --> 01:25:47.980
- You aren't.

01:25:48.004 --> 01:25:49.213
- Someone has to stay alert.

01:26:04.504 --> 01:26:08.163
The creatures.

01:26:11.442 --> 01:26:15.905
- Probably what everybody
wants, to stay alive,

01:26:15.929 --> 01:26:18.587
and breathe, to eat. Have kids.

01:26:22.349 --> 01:26:24.051
- How come you don't
have any kids?

01:26:24.075 --> 01:26:27.434
- That's a personal question.

01:26:27.458 --> 01:26:32.256
- I'm sorry. I just think
you'd be a cool mom.

01:26:41.368 --> 01:26:42.368
- I was.

01:27:03.459 --> 01:27:05.392
Anything happening?

01:27:13.676 --> 01:27:14.676
- Not a sound.

01:27:22.202 --> 01:27:24.308
I know they're out
there somewhere.

01:27:25.309 --> 01:27:27.000
I don't know what
they're waiting on.

01:27:29.451 --> 01:27:31.970
- Not hungry enough, yet.

01:27:33.213 --> 01:27:37.528
- Maybe we scared them.
You did kill a few.

01:27:50.955 --> 01:27:54.959
- Sam, there's only
seven bullets left.

01:27:56.961 --> 01:27:58.041
- It's not enough.
- I know.

01:28:11.389 --> 01:28:14.047
I wasn't there
when she was born.

01:28:17.982 --> 01:28:22.031
Rachel went into labor
three weeks early.

01:28:22.055 --> 01:28:23.401
I was at a conference in Oregon.

01:28:34.930 --> 01:28:36.000
I missed-

01:28:41.592 --> 01:28:44.249
watching her come
into the world.

01:28:48.702 --> 01:28:51.843
And now-now I'm gonna
have to watch her-

01:28:54.605 --> 01:28:57.377
- I'm not gonna let it happen.

01:28:57.401 --> 01:28:58.505
Not to you.

01:29:07.376 --> 01:29:09.941
I hate this waiting around.

01:29:09.965 --> 01:29:13.116
Letting them choose the moment.

01:29:13.140 --> 01:29:14.763
- There's nothing
else we can do.

01:29:16.696 --> 01:29:19.502
- I read the Island Zero report.

01:29:19.526 --> 01:29:22.919
They can only be out of the
water for an hour at a time.

01:29:22.943 --> 01:29:25.094
And they hunt at night.

01:29:25.118 --> 01:29:29.881
If they do attack, it will
be in the next five hours.

01:29:35.439 --> 01:29:37.762
- I've got every
window boarded up.

01:29:37.786 --> 01:29:40.074
- But even if we hold them
off tonight, what about

01:29:40.098 --> 01:29:42.767
tomorrow night? And
the night after?

01:29:42.791 --> 01:29:45.276
In a week we'll be out
of food and water.

01:29:46.622 --> 01:29:50.084
Maybe it's the soldier in me,
but starving to death is not

01:29:50.108 --> 01:29:51.983
how I wanna go down.

01:29:52.007 --> 01:29:53.916
- Are you suggesting
we attack them?

01:29:53.940 --> 01:29:57.747
- We know they're attracted
to light and to noise.

01:29:57.771 --> 01:29:59.231
That's how they
locate their prey.

01:29:59.255 --> 01:30:02.362
- They don't need to find
us, they know where we are.

01:30:04.813 --> 01:30:07.816
- So let's roll out
the welcome mat.

01:31:09.774 --> 01:31:12.132
- What if this is the only
population on earth, I'd be

01:31:12.156 --> 01:31:14.721
killing the last
of their species.

01:31:14.745 --> 01:31:15.745
- Good!

01:32:03.897 --> 01:32:08.464
- We can't stay here.
We need to leave.

01:32:08.488 --> 01:32:11.077
- Maybe they're
coming to rescue us.

01:32:15.944 --> 01:32:17.577
Go, now!

01:32:17.601 --> 01:32:18.601
- Sam!

01:32:19.395 --> 01:32:21.225
Shouldn't we at least
wait to see if-

01:32:30.924 --> 01:32:31.924
- Lucy!

01:32:35.653 --> 01:32:38.149
- No! No! No!

01:32:38.173 --> 01:32:40.634
Lucy! No!

01:32:40.658 --> 01:32:43.775
Oh, my go-Oh, my God!

01:32:43.799 --> 01:32:46.226
- Sam, we need to leave now!
- No. No!

01:32:46.250 --> 01:32:48.608
- Sam, we have to leave!
- Please don't leave me!

01:32:48.632 --> 01:32:50.806
- Please! No!
- They're coming!

01:32:51.669 --> 01:32:53.785
Sam!

01:32:53.809 --> 01:32:55.615
- Sam!
- Don't leave me!

01:32:55.639 --> 01:32:57.433
No! No!

01:33:48.553 --> 01:33:52.040
- Here! Here! We're here!

01:33:54.042 --> 01:33:57.528
Where's Lucy?

01:34:09.816 --> 01:34:12.923
Dad?

01:34:13.717 --> 01:34:16.834
- Quiet. We have to be quiet.
- No! We can't leave him!

01:34:16.858 --> 01:34:19.802
Go back! We have to go back!

01:34:19.826 --> 01:34:22.805
- No, I'm in charge, soldier!

01:34:22.829 --> 01:34:25.808
My job is to keep you alive,
and I am going to do that,

01:34:25.832 --> 01:34:27.258
you got that?

01:34:27.282 --> 01:34:30.192
That is what I am going to do!

01:34:30.216 --> 01:34:32.701
And it's what I'm going to do.

01:35:38.284 --> 01:35:42.529
- We're far enough away, now.
Can't you turn on the engine?

01:35:43.703 --> 01:35:49.098
- No engine, no noise. There
might be more of them.

01:35:49.122 --> 01:35:50.928
We have to be silent.

01:35:50.952 --> 01:35:52.781
- It's forty miles
to the mainland.

01:35:53.817 --> 01:35:55.991
You're gonna row the whole way?

01:35:57.165 --> 01:36:00.651
- I can do it. I can do it.

01:36:07.485 --> 01:36:08.555
I can do it.

01:36:09.305 --> 01:36:15.844
