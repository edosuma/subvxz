12:39.558 --> 12:42.356
You ain't gonna light up here?

12:42.428 --> 12:45.998
Well, why not?
- Well, you'll burn us down.

12:48.100 --> 12:50.650
Don't make no difference, kid.

12:50.669 --> 12:53.263
We're gone, no doubt about it.

12:55.274 --> 12:58.249
Ah, it's nothin' but a old pig car.

13:00.513 --> 13:03.414
Uh, pigs eat corn.
This here's hay.

13:05.217 --> 13:08.532
Well, it's nothin' but a old steer car.

in here in a couple of hours.

13:29.079 --> 13:30.142
Well, what of it?

13:30.242 --> 13:33.939
Steers got horns, kid.
You don't have any.

13:36.949 --> 13:39.669
Ah, they wouldn't do that to us.

13:40.352 --> 13:44.550
What do you mean, 'us'?
- I'll call a cop.

13:44.623 --> 13:47.768
Ninety days on the rocks ain't horns.

13:48.627 --> 13:51.530
It ain't the rocks, kid-
not in this part of the country.

13:51.630 --> 13:55.401
And it's not 90 days either.
You're paroled to the bottom of a pit...

13:55.501 --> 13:58.904
...while the sheriff pockets the two dollars
that he's paid every day for your keep.

13:59.004 --> 14:04.176
And that's no ghost story. This country's
in the midst of an economic depression.

14:04.276 --> 14:06.679
Two dollars a day is a lot of money.

14:06.779 --> 14:09.839

14:33.372 --> 14:37.027
...but you ain't seen Mike around, I guess.

14:38.510 --> 14:41.720

broke down in Texas.

17:42.447 --> 17:44.447
Get outta here, you.

17:48.353 --> 17:53.290

21:38.417 --> 21:40.719
Who forgot to grease those journal boxes?

21:40.819 --> 21:44.723
Next time I pick up an empty,
I'm not gonna have it burned...

21:44.823 --> 21:49.127
'cause some damned yardlet
forgot to grease the journal box.

21:49.227 --> 21:53.632
Now you clean all those housings.
Oil the bearings, wedges, everything.

21:53.732 --> 21:56.435
You don't ever hand me another fire.

21:56.535 --> 21:58.737
Th-That's not what happened.
- I don't care.

21:58.837 --> 22:03.865
You never let it happen again.
Never. Say it.

22:05.510 --> 22:07.705
It'll never happen again.

22:12.050 --> 22:15.053
Now you get that engine
down to the tower...

22:15.153 --> 22:18.978
...and you fill it with water,

22:30.669 --> 22:33.638
Bastard.
I'll fix him, so help me, God.

22:33.738 --> 22:36.075

What to you want for Christmas, Leach?
I'll tell you what:

22:40.812 --> 22:44.416
The one thing that's never been done
to the Shack-Think, Leach.

22:44.516 --> 22:47.652
A tramp haulin' that son of a bitch
off his high almighty-...

22:47.752 --> 22:50.514
A miserable bastard hobo
ridin' his train. 

22:50.614 --> 22:51.857
Ah, it'll never happen.

22:51.957 --> 22:54.687
Maybe it has.

23:00.565 --> 23:04.469
Look. Any you fellas Baptists?
Well, my old man's a Baptist.

23:04.569 --> 23:07.305
I'm tryin' to get home to see him.

23:07.405 --> 23:09.405
He's dyin'.

23:09.407 --> 23:12.711
You're goin' for a year on the rocks.
- Up yours.

23:12.811 --> 23:15.180
You gonna let that loudmouth
talk like that to you?

23:15.280 --> 23:20.040
Yeah. He's right. Look here, you little squirt.
- Cut it.

23:20.685 --> 23:24.589
How'd you make that train?
- Easy. It's like any other.

23:24.689 --> 23:27.993
Nobody makes that one.
- It's a local. It's nothin'.

23:28.093 --> 23:31.897
Nineteen ain't just a local.
- Haven't you heard of the Shack?

23:31.997 --> 23:34.727
The 19 belongs to him.
- So?

23:34.799 --> 23:38.069
So you ain't gonna live through the night.

23:38.169 --> 23:42.902
It was easy. Train come off a curve.
I found a blind.

23:42.974 --> 23:47.712
Well, I just laid down there.
I see the train man, his coattails flyin'.

23:47.812 --> 23:51.783
Of course, I was curious, so I jump on
to give the big man a stare in the face.

23:51.883 --> 23:54.219
And you can figure,
we didn't gab much.

23:54.319 --> 23:57.722
He's wavin' his hammer and swearin'
like a big-ass Baptist...

23:57.822 --> 24:01.393
...so I just ditched him,
settled down in the empty.

24:01.493 --> 24:03.762
Had him beat all to hell too.
Well, this sorry lookin' bo...

24:03.862 --> 24:06.479
...come draggin' his
ass through the transom,

24:06.579 --> 24:07.833
got us both locked in.

24:07.933 --> 24:12.537
So I had to burn my way out.
He's cinders now. That's for sure.

24:12.637 --> 24:15.401
Leach, like I told ya.

24:15.473 --> 24:17.776
You're gonna get a Christmas present

24:17.876 --> 24:20.367

24:28.553 --> 24:29.857
7:00 in the morning.

24:29.957 --> 24:33.291
I wouldn't miss this. I've
been waitin' for years.

24:33.391 --> 24:35.594
You ain't alone.
Hey, don't forget Cracker.

24:35.694 --> 24:37.596
He oughta be good for an easy 20.

You're tellin' me.
- [Man Laughs] Yes, sir.

24:40.932 --> 24:44.197
It's like money in the bank.

24:44.269 --> 24:48.433
I don't know.
Somethin' ain't right.

24:48.506 --> 24:51.532
[Man #2 Chuckling] Stop worryin'.

24:51.610 --> 24:55.647
You said it yourself.

25:09.427 --> 25:12.831
...till we've had our fun
and we collected our money.

25:12.931 --> 25:16.768
And you get your ass down to that junction.
You tell your bo friends...

25:16.868 --> 25:20.098
...that we got a new king of the road.

25:24.609 --> 25:27.879
[F.D.R. On Radio] My friends, the most
effective means of preventing such evils...

25:27.979 --> 25:30.248
...in this work relief program...
- [Snoring]

25:30.348 --> 25:34.152
Will be the eternal vigilance

[Continues Snoring]

25:35.640 --> 25:38.690
I call upon my fellow citizens everywhere...

25:38.790 --> 25:43.461
...to cooperate with me
in making this the most efficient...

25:43.561 --> 25:46.431

- It is time to provide a smashing answer...

25:52.771 --> 25:56.875
...for those cynical men
who say that a democracy...

25:56.975 --> 26:00.809
...cannot be honest,
cannot be efficient.

26:00.879 --> 26:03.871
If you will help,
this can be done.

26:03.948 --> 26:09.087
I therefore hope that you will watch
the work in every corner of the nation.

Neither you nor I want criticism...

26:24.169 --> 26:29.129
...conceived in a purely fault-finding
or partisan spirit.

26:29.207 --> 26:34.577
But I am jealous of the right
of every citizen...

27:11.416 --> 27:16.410
Mmm. Say, it figured.
You had to try him sometime.

27:16.488 --> 27:20.091
Twenty miles in an empty stockcar
ain't exactly tryin' him.

29:26.651 --> 29:28.887
Why he used his hammer or somethin'.

29:42.901 --> 29:45.062
Did he use his hammer?

29:45.136 --> 29:48.873
Hmm, the hammer's mostly for show.
Scares some.

29:48.973 --> 29:52.811
It's the hands you gotta watch out for.
And the brain.

Aw, the hell he did.

They got him down at the yard.

Why don't you take your hat off?

01:35:22.346 --> 01:35:24.415
You come in here like you was a millionaire.

01:35:24.515 --> 01:35:26.584
Well, you're not.
You're a casual.

01:35:26.684 --> 01:35:30.020
You ain't even seen a first-class hobo yet.

01:35:30.120 --> 01:35:32.022
Where you been sleepin'?

01:35:32.122 --> 01:35:34.122

You've slept out.
Why don't you say so?

You got any money?
- Couple of pennies.

01:35:40.798 --> 01:35:43.494
Willing to be searched?

01:35:43.567 --> 01:35:46.161
You're a punk, a deadbeat.

01:35:46.236 --> 01:35:50.074
No bum worth a damn is gonna
let himself be picked over.

Thirty days?

Where do you think you're at?

01:35:56.714 --> 01:35:59.617
You let some two-bit cop cut you down,
and now you're gonna come in here...

01:35:59.717 --> 01:36:02.386
...and figure on cuttin' me
and Shack down at the same time?

01:36:02.486 --> 01:36:04.486
Damn, boy.

01:36:04.488 --> 01:36:08.219
You ain't even ready for a half-grown girl.

01:36:08.292 --> 01:36:12.029
One of those New Orleans women
get a hold of you, you'd cry for your mama.

01:36:12.129 --> 01:36:14.865
But it's plain you've already
cried for your mama.

01:36:14.965 --> 01:36:17.593
Get your head up.

01:36:17.668 --> 01:36:21.408
What have you learned?
Spit it out. How much?

01:36:24.975 --> 01:36:29.480
I'm gonna tell you once, never again,
so listen tight.

01:36:30.614 --> 01:36:34.015
You've got a chance to be a good bum.

01:36:35.352 --> 01:36:37.843
You can be a meat eater, kid-

01:36:37.921 --> 01:36:40.641
I mean people,
not their garbage.

01:36:43.961 --> 01:36:46.764
I wanna see you rough as a jungle cat.

01:36:46.864 --> 01:36:49.800
Keep on goin' the way you are.
Keep gettin' knocked around...

01:36:49.900 --> 01:36:52.036
...in the same places
till the knocks don't hurt anymore.

01:36:52.136 --> 01:36:55.536
Then you run with the train.
Remember it.

01:36:55.973 --> 01:36:58.876
But don't ever grab
unless you're sure you can hold on.

01:36:58.976 --> 01:37:01.946
If you ever let go,
she'll throw you under.

01:37:02.046 --> 01:37:05.379
Want some new togs for the kid?

01:37:05.449 --> 01:37:07.449
No.

01:50:15.818 --> 01:50:17.911
It hurts.

01:50:17.987 --> 01:50:20.547
[Groans]

01:50:20.623 --> 01:50:25.061
Get your ass over here.
Now you get us the hell outta here.

01:50:25.161 --> 01:50:28.995
[Groaning Continues]
- Now.

01:50:29.064 --> 01:50:31.897
[Stoker] Oh. Help. Oh.

01:50:31.967 --> 01:50:34.367
[Train Chugging]...

01:50:47.950 --> 01:50:52.751
...[Stoker Continues Groaning]

01:50:59.962 --> 01:51:02.260
You son of a-...

01:51:02.331 --> 01:51:04.959
...[Chuckles]...

01:51:09.471 --> 01:51:11.530
...[Growls]

01:51:14.710 --> 01:51:16.710
You bastard.

01:51:19.682 --> 01:51:22.218
[Shack] Got yourself a game leg, huh, kid?

01:51:22.318 --> 01:51:23.961
You should've jumped off.

01:51:24.061 --> 01:51:26.922
That would have been
the smart thing to do.

01:51:27.022 --> 01:51:30.253
[Laughs] You should've jumped, kid.

01:51:30.326 --> 01:51:34.729
I gotta hand it to you, kid.
Yes, sir.

01:51:34.797 --> 01:51:37.466
You played both sides against the middle.

01:51:37.566 --> 01:51:40.803
Had yourself a high old time while it lasted.

01:51:40.903 --> 01:51:44.634
[Laughing]

01:51:44.707 --> 01:51:47.610
Yeah, but now it's lasted long enough.

01:51:47.710 --> 01:51:51.614
Oh, you can keep runnin', kid,
but you're runnin' out of train.

01:51:51.714 --> 01:51:55.650
[Laughs] And there's no place to hide.

01:51:55.718 --> 01:52:00.289
My brakey's cracked his neck,
the hide's peelin' off the black...

01:52:00.389 --> 01:52:02.591
...and the Hogger's ready for the loony bin.

01:52:02.691 --> 01:52:05.785
And all because of you.
[Chuckles]

01:52:05.861 --> 01:52:08.964
That's a pretty fair day's work
for a tenderfoot.

01:52:09.064 --> 01:52:11.624
[Laughs]

01:52:11.700 --> 01:52:13.316
But now I'm gonna show you what happens...

01:52:13.416 --> 01:52:15.271
...to people who ride on
my train without a ticket.

01:52:15.371 --> 01:52:19.034
[Laughs]
Too bad you didn't get me too, kid.

01:52:19.108 --> 01:52:22.978
Too bad you didn't let that pin bust you up
instead of me.

01:52:23.078 --> 01:52:27.316
'Cause now I'm gonna spread your ass
all over these tracks like manure.

01:52:27.416 --> 01:52:30.681
Shack.
Your fight's over here.

01:52:30.753 --> 01:52:34.086
[Grunts]...

01:52:35.624 --> 01:52:38.149
...[Groaning]...

01:52:51.807 --> 01:52:54.401
...[Screaming]...

01:52:54.476 --> 01:52:56.476
...[Grunts]...

01:53:04.887 --> 01:53:07.321
...[Grunts]...

01:53:10.125 --> 01:53:12.355
...[Grunts]
- Jesus.

01:53:21.236 --> 01:53:23.500
[Snickers]

01:53:27.943 --> 01:53:30.537
Uh-huh.

01:53:30.612 --> 01:53:32.842
Uh-huh.
[Snickers]...

01:53:39.922 --> 01:53:42.789
...[Screams, Groans]...

01:53:42.858 --> 01:53:46.021
...[Both Grunting]...

01:53:50.699 --> 01:53:53.634
...[Grunting Continues]...

01:53:55.971 --> 01:53:58.804
...[Mutters]...

01:54:04.947 --> 01:54:08.348
...[Gurgles, Exhales]

01:54:08.417 --> 01:54:11.318
Don't belly up on me, bo.

01:54:11.387 --> 01:54:15.118
You promised me a fight.
[Laughs]

01:54:15.190 --> 01:54:17.590
Ghost story, huh?
[Laughs]

01:54:17.659 --> 01:54:21.755
Smart-ass.
[Screams]

01:54:33.976 --> 01:54:37.139
Pick it- Pick it up.

01:54:47.890 --> 01:54:50.757
[Shack Laughs]...

01:54:50.826 --> 01:54:53.351
...[Grunting Continues]...

01:55:00.903 --> 01:55:03.770
...[Shack Screams]...

01:55:03.839 --> 01:55:07.206
...[Grunting Continues]...

01:55:08.911 --> 01:55:12.711
...[Groans]
- [Panting]...

01:55:26.628 --> 01:55:29.791
...[Laughing]

01:55:34.403 --> 01:55:37.373
You wanna play?
You wanna play, huh, bo?

01:55:37.473 --> 01:55:41.671
[Laughing] Come on.

01:55:44.913 --> 01:55:47.814
[Whistle Blowing]
- Smart-ass.

01:55:47.883 --> 01:55:50.716
[Laughing]
- [Grunting]

01:55:55.791 --> 01:55:57.791
Hey.

01:56:10.572 --> 01:56:15.010
Oh, no, you don't, Shack.
Like you said, I promised you a fight.

01:56:15.110 --> 01:56:17.346
Now, get your ass up here...

01:56:17.446 --> 01:56:21.441
...you dirty, miserable,
no-good son of a bitch.

01:56:58.253 --> 01:57:00.744
[Grunts]...

01:57:04.660 --> 01:57:09.222
Oh, damn.
- [Shack Screaming]...

01:57:11.533 --> 01:57:15.128
...[Groaning]...

01:57:24.046 --> 01:57:26.514
...[Grunts]...

01:57:41.730 --> 01:57:43.891
...[Screams]...

01:57:50.405 --> 01:57:55.206
Hey, bo.
- [Panting]...

01:57:55.277 --> 01:57:59.014
...[Shack In Distance]
You ain't seen the last of me.

01:57:59.114 --> 01:58:03.551
You ain't seen the last of me.

01:58:07.856 --> 01:58:11.053
[Laughing]

01:58:11.126 --> 01:58:14.254
Yes, sir. Gee whiz.

01:58:14.329 --> 01:58:17.049
Me and you,
if we ain't the team.

01:58:17.099 --> 01:58:20.502
Well-Well, we can go to prison
and free the cons.

01:58:20.602 --> 01:58:25.362
We can capture Mexico.
We can do in Rome as the dagos do.

01:58:25.374 --> 01:58:28.210
Knockin' down everything we see,
all stuck on ourselves.

01:58:28.310 --> 01:58:31.507
[Laughing] Cigaret and A-#1.

01:58:31.580 --> 01:58:36.517
[Laughing Continues] Yes, sir.

01:58:38.887 --> 01:58:43.153
Kid, you got no class.

01:58:44.726 --> 01:58:47.286
[Screams]

01:58:52.267 --> 01:58:55.464
Stick to barns, kid.

01:58:55.537 --> 01:58:58.005
Run like the devil.

01:58:58.073 --> 01:59:01.236
Get a tin can and take up moochin'.

01:59:01.309 --> 01:59:03.545
Tackle back doors for a nickel.

01:59:03.645 --> 01:59:08.105
Tell 'em your story.
Make 'em weep.

01:59:08.183 --> 01:59:10.886
You could've been a meat eater, kid.

01:59:10.986 --> 01:59:13.889
But you didn't listen to me
when I laid it down.

01:59:13.989 --> 01:59:18.085
Stay off the tracks.
Forget it.

01:59:18.160 --> 01:59:21.425
It's a bum's world for a bum.

01:59:21.496 --> 01:59:25.000
You'll never be
Emperor of the North Pole, kid.

01:59:25.100 --> 01:59:29.230
You had the juice, kid,
but not the heart.

01:59:29.304 --> 01:59:32.171
And they both go together.

01:59:32.240 --> 01:59:35.767
You're all gab and no feel.

01:59:35.844 --> 01:59:38.813
And nobody can teach you that.

01:59:38.880 --> 01:59:41.110
Not even A-#1.

01:59:41.183 --> 01:59:44.152
So stay off the train.

01:59:44.219 --> 01:59:47.484
She'll throw you under for sure.

01:59:47.556 --> 01:59:50.684
Remember me for that.

01:59:50.759 --> 01:59:52.759
So long, kid.
