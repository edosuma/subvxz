01:13.248 --> 01:14.817
Not today, man.

01:17.619 --> 01:19.621
You remember what day it is?

01:19.654 --> 01:21.256
Why are you being so hostile?

01:21.289 --> 01:23.425
Don't...

01:23.458 --> 01:25.027
Oh, my God!

01:26.428 --> 01:28.898
We've got to start going.

01:37.907 --> 01:41.110
We have 176 text messages.

01:41.144 --> 01:42.444
Wow.

01:42.477 --> 01:44.379
- <i>Yo, it's Mandy.</i>
- Mandy.

01:44.412 --> 01:46.883
<i>Are you coming to my
End of the World Party tonight?</i>

01:46.916 --> 01:49.252
<i>You know you are.
I don't want to hear any of your bullshit.</i>

01:49.284 --> 01:50.385
Oh, we gotta go.

01:50.418 --> 01:53.689
<i>Also Pauly Shore's coming.</i>

01:53.723 --> 01:56.259
<i>Um, oh. Also,
I have Ketamine nasal spray.</i>

01:56.291 --> 01:57.827
<i>Not even legal,
just for fun.</i>

01:57.860 --> 01:59.729
No, no, no, no, no.

01:59.762 --> 02:03.132
- <i>A little left for you, come on over.</i>
- Ugh, so mean.

02:03.166 --> 02:04.734
<i>What do you think I
should wear to Mandy's tonight?</i>

02:04.767 --> 02:08.137
<i>I've got mechanic-on-vacation
kind of energy... No?</i>

02:08.170 --> 02:11.741
<i>I could just go, like,
full Santa Fe art teacher, right.</i>

02:11.774 --> 02:15.812
<i>Just drape myself in linen
for the End of the World.</i>

02:15.845 --> 02:19.314
What is this, Ezra?

02:19.347 --> 02:21.684
<i>I'm just kind of trying
to keep in touch</i>

02:21.717 --> 02:23.418
<i>with the people that I love.</i>

02:23.451 --> 02:25.554
Haven't seen him
since his Bar Mitzvah.

02:25.587 --> 02:27.389
<i>And number two, um...</i>

02:27.422 --> 02:29.091
- Is he shirtless?
- <i>There's this fuckin' party,</i>

02:29.125 --> 02:31.526
- <i>It's kind of the last, like...</i>
- Yes?

02:31.560 --> 02:33.162
- <i>...hurrah...</i>
- He's kinda hot.

02:33.196 --> 02:34.596
He's your cousin.

02:34.629 --> 02:35.965
- <i>...whatever you call it, so...</i>
- I know, but...

02:35.998 --> 02:37.834
...I was wondering if you
could buy me some alcohol.

02:40.970 --> 02:42.437
Okay, so...

02:42.470 --> 02:45.241
Maybe we don't have to
go out to a party tonight,

02:45.274 --> 02:48.510
but we can do
something more spiritual.

02:48.543 --> 02:50.579
What if we went to the beach?

02:50.612 --> 02:53.015
Remember when we used
to go to the beach?

02:53.049 --> 02:54.717
We were so happy then.

02:54.750 --> 02:57.552
That was, like, the last time
you really felt free, right?

02:57.586 --> 03:00.122
I don't know
what to tell you, it's like...

03:00.156 --> 03:03.893
My whole life.
I have been terrified of dying alone,

03:03.926 --> 03:08.363
and tonight,
I am literally dying alone.

03:08.396 --> 03:10.099
But you're not alone,
you have me.

03:10.132 --> 03:12.400
Man, you don't count, okay?

03:12.434 --> 03:14.203
You're metaphysical.

03:14.237 --> 03:16.939
Look, tonight, I just wanna, like,

03:16.973 --> 03:20.475
get really fucking high,
eat until I puke,

03:20.508 --> 03:22.044
and then die.

03:22.078 --> 03:25.882
I could list so many
problems with that idea,

03:26.883 --> 03:29.752
but the first one is,
you're out of weed.

03:35.191 --> 03:36.826
Of all the days,

03:36.859 --> 03:39.262
you really think you should be self-medicating today?

03:39.295 --> 03:41.197
Why can't you just be present?

03:41.230 --> 03:45.902
I have an idea. Why don't I give
myself the present of doing drugs?

03:45.935 --> 03:47.669
- Hello.
- Hi.

03:47.703 --> 03:50.572
- Were you trying to go to the weed store?
- Yeah.

03:50.605 --> 03:51.974
I kind of bought it out.

03:52.008 --> 03:54.542
Oh, like, you bought
all the drugs inside?

03:54.576 --> 03:56.312
They gave me a deal,
I just cleaned 'em out

03:56.345 --> 03:57.713
'cause I just was like,

03:57.747 --> 03:59.916
I don't wanna be without
on the last day.

04:00.917 --> 04:02.818
All right, well,
I guess I'll, uh...

04:02.852 --> 04:06.122
I mean, I could give you some.
I'm not gonna use all of it, obviously.

04:06.155 --> 04:08.858
It's not like I'm saving for a rainy day.

04:08.891 --> 04:11.559
Yeah, sure,
that that would be cool.

04:11.593 --> 04:12.962
I just don't want to do it
in this alleyway,

04:12.995 --> 04:14.263
it feels a little shady.

04:14.297 --> 04:16.065
and kinda disrespectful
to the medicine.

04:16.098 --> 04:18.701
If you want to come to my spot,
it's pretty dope,

04:18.733 --> 04:21.070
it's like a very quick walk
if you wanna join me.

04:23.505 --> 04:25.274
- Yeah, sure. Why not?
- Great.

04:25.308 --> 04:27.677
A few minutes with someone on
the last day of Earth? Why not?

04:27.710 --> 04:29.679
Right, yeah, cool, man.

04:29.712 --> 04:32.614
- Yeah, just come with me. It's right here.
- All right.

04:32.647 --> 04:35.318
- You live around here?
- Yeah, just, uh, just down the block.

04:35.351 --> 04:37.720
- Oh, me too. Is this your spot?
- Yeah.

04:39.822 --> 04:42.291
So yeah,
it's just right up here,

04:42.325 --> 04:43.793
Your...
Your house? Or...

04:43.826 --> 04:45.795
It's not my actual abode, my...

04:46.395 --> 04:47.562
My house is, uh...

04:47.595 --> 04:49.597
You know, a couple blocks away.

04:49.631 --> 04:51.734
- Yeah.
- This is public land, it's not mine,

04:51.767 --> 04:53.269
but who's gonna
arrest me today?

04:54.737 --> 04:56.638
So, yeah,
I figured, like, uh...

04:56.671 --> 04:58.506
I mean, there's...
There's enough for everybody,

04:58.540 --> 05:01.643
And also, like,
I have some DMT, you know?

05:01.677 --> 05:03.179
So I was gonna maybe do that,

05:03.212 --> 05:05.647
but then I was like,
"Maybe that's just like a hat on a hat."

05:05.681 --> 05:07.316
You know I mean?
What's the point in doing...

05:07.350 --> 05:11.153
- Sure.
- ...DMT when you're about to actually experience real death?

05:11.187 --> 05:13.422
I have also CBD suppositories,

05:13.456 --> 05:15.124
that, um, my girlfriend...

05:15.157 --> 05:16.125
My ex-girlfriend...

05:16.158 --> 05:18.493
She used to get, like,
pretty bad, uh, cramps

05:18.526 --> 05:20.595
- when she had her menses.
- Uh.

05:20.628 --> 05:22.530
So, if... Do either of
you guys have your period,

05:22.564 --> 05:24.033
or are either of you
in your menses?

05:26.601 --> 05:29.705
Sorry, who, uh...
Who are you talking to?

05:29.739 --> 05:32.208
I'm talking to you
and the childlike woman

05:32.241 --> 05:34.777
that I'm now looking at
with the black hat on.

05:39.315 --> 05:42.151
Guys. Honestly,
I don't appreciate whispering, like...

05:42.184 --> 05:44.586
I'm so...
I'm so sorry, it's just... This really.

05:44.619 --> 05:47.289
No one's ever
acknowledged me before.

05:47.323 --> 05:48.858
No one's ever seen me.

05:48.891 --> 05:50.393
Is this
an abusive relationship?

05:50.426 --> 05:52.527
Uh, no, she's, uh,
she's metaphysical...

05:52.560 --> 05:54.430
- Um... Younger self.
- ...is the thing.

05:54.463 --> 05:56.799
- So...
- Oh. Yeah, okay, that makes sense.

05:56.832 --> 05:59.402
Your her younger self. Yeah.

05:59.435 --> 06:02.171
- I know it sounds crazy.
- Doesn't sound crazy to me.

06:02.204 --> 06:03.638
I had my younger self here.

06:03.671 --> 06:06.742
- Uh, what...
- Where did he go?

06:06.776 --> 06:09.211
He fell off the side of
a mountain on a hike.

06:11.414 --> 06:13.015
He lost his footing.

06:15.017 --> 06:17.219
If you don't want to be
with your younger self,

06:17.753 --> 06:18.954
you don't have to be.

06:19.688 --> 06:21.290
If you wanna be truly alone,

06:22.124 --> 06:23.625
you can be truly alone.

06:27.496 --> 06:29.031
Um, okay,
so which one of these...

06:29.065 --> 06:30.766
Can we just, uh...
I think we'll just grab...

06:30.800 --> 06:33.536
- Yeah, grab, uh... Grab a couple of those 'melos.
- Thank you, 'cause, uh...

06:33.568 --> 06:36.505
- I like to call the caramels, "'melos."
- Yeah, that's cool.

06:36.539 --> 06:38.541
But they might be uppers,
so heads up.

06:38.573 --> 06:40.242
- Okay. And, um...
- And, uh, yeah,

06:40.276 --> 06:43.145
grab a couple store-bought,
those Rollupz, those Rollies.

06:43.179 --> 06:45.247
- Thank you so much.
- And it was nice to meet you.

06:45.281 --> 06:47.550
Hey, uh...
Hey, have a nice, uh, trip, man.

06:47.582 --> 06:48.918
- And, um...
- Hey, actually,

06:48.951 --> 06:51.619
I don't know if I wanna
be alone, can I...

06:51.653 --> 06:53.756
Can I crash with you guys?
Can I come with you?

06:53.789 --> 06:55.590
I'm sorry, but we don't...
We gotta go.

06:57.460 --> 06:59.562
That was truly terrifying.

06:59.594 --> 07:02.231
Yeah, that dude was real dark.

07:03.065 --> 07:04.733
Uh, you're...
You're calling him dark?

07:04.767 --> 07:08.104
You guys had the same exact
plan for tonight, verbatim.

07:08.137 --> 07:10.139
Talk about
a Ghost of Christmas Future.

07:10.973 --> 07:12.908
The fuck
is that supposed to mean?

07:12.942 --> 07:13.742
Liza.

07:30.759 --> 07:31.861
Go.

07:32.627 --> 07:33.829
Just, like, go.

07:38.467 --> 07:39.667
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:42.705 --> 07:45.007
You... You cross
this bridge often?

07:45.574 --> 07:48.210
Yeah, I do, actually.

07:48.244 --> 07:50.312
I live just up the hill.

07:50.346 --> 07:52.748
- Oh, you moved.
- Did.

07:55.650 --> 07:56.719
Um...

07:57.386 --> 07:59.121
I'm sorry. I, um...

08:00.055 --> 08:02.958
that I haven't been in touch.

08:04.193 --> 08:05.660
Yeah, you just stopped.

08:05.694 --> 08:07.163
And I just...

08:08.531 --> 08:10.566
stopped too, I guess.

08:10.599 --> 08:12.835
Well, it's nice to see you...
See you now.

08:14.036 --> 08:16.238
- You look good.
- No, I don't.

08:16.805 --> 08:18.207
But thank you.

08:21.677 --> 08:23.746
How are you, Nate?

08:23.779 --> 08:27.349
Or is that a stupid question
to ask today?

08:28.817 --> 08:30.553
Yeah, I don't know.

08:30.586 --> 08:32.121
You, um, you going to...

08:32.821 --> 08:34.590
Mandy's tonight?

08:34.623 --> 08:36.258
Yeah. I don't know
if I'm gonna...

08:39.662 --> 08:41.130
make it, but...

08:41.163 --> 08:43.164
You have a full night
ahead of you?

08:43.198 --> 08:44.133
Yeah, pretty full,

08:44.166 --> 08:46.635
just gonna get,
like, fucked up,

08:46.669 --> 08:49.171
and then, if all goes well...

08:50.039 --> 08:51.607
puke.

08:51.640 --> 08:53.642
And that's
why you have parties.

08:53.677 --> 08:55.578
Oh, right, yeah.

08:55.611 --> 08:56.845
I prefer, uh...

08:57.513 --> 08:58.881
a solo journey...

09:00.583 --> 09:01.951
as you know.

09:05.120 --> 09:06.922
It's really nice
to see you, though.

09:08.123 --> 09:10.092
Yeah, it's good
to see you too, Liza.

09:11.760 --> 09:12.928
Bye, Nate.

09:24.373 --> 09:25.407
What was that?

09:28.244 --> 09:29.111
I just, I...

09:30.012 --> 09:33.683
I panic, man. I become so...

09:33.717 --> 09:35.451
fucking emotionally, like...

09:37.319 --> 09:40.089
I didn't expect
to see that dude today.

09:40.122 --> 09:41.624
And like...

09:41.657 --> 09:44.627
I loved him.
I loved him so much

09:44.660 --> 09:47.229
and I fucked everything up.
I just...

09:47.763 --> 09:48.964
It's my whole life.

09:48.998 --> 09:52.468
My whole life has just been
a series of regret

09:52.501 --> 09:54.570
after regret after regret.

09:54.603 --> 09:58.440
I am just...
I'm such a fucking idiot.

09:58.474 --> 10:00.042
This is what I've been saying.

10:00.542 --> 10:01.777
Tonight's the night.

10:01.810 --> 10:04.947
You can face those regrets
and turn them around.

10:06.515 --> 10:07.383
Come on.

10:07.783 --> 10:09.018
Fuck it.

10:13.255 --> 10:14.390
All right.

10:19.028 --> 10:19.895
Fuck it.

10:21.463 --> 10:22.531
Let's go with a bang.

10:43.886 --> 10:49.525
<i>♪ Disoriented ♪</i>

10:52.428 --> 10:58.802
<i>♪ When I'm waking up ♪</i>

10:58.834 --> 11:01.503
- Okay, let's talk regrets.
- Okay.

11:04.006 --> 11:06.475
- Obviously, the biggest one is Dad.
- Right.

11:06.508 --> 11:09.078
I would like to be honest,

11:09.111 --> 11:12.281
even though it's scary,
tonight, with him.

11:12.314 --> 11:13.449
Yeah.

11:13.482 --> 11:15.184
And...

11:15.851 --> 11:17.386
where does that leave Mom?

11:20.155 --> 11:21.590
Let's circle back to her.

11:23.492 --> 11:25.127
- All right, maybe.
- Yeah.

11:25.160 --> 11:28.864
Okay, next up,
I would like to make amends with Ala.

11:28.897 --> 11:31.133
That was a shitty situation.

11:31.166 --> 11:32.501
- Yeah.
- Shouldn't have happened.

11:32.534 --> 11:35.537
Yeah. We let some dumb shit
get between us

11:35.571 --> 11:37.005
and tonight, that ends.

11:37.906 --> 11:40.909
Next person I would like
to engage with

11:40.943 --> 11:44.179
in a way that feels, you know,
I guess confrontational,

11:44.213 --> 11:46.783
is Larry.

11:46.816 --> 11:48.550
- Fuck that guy.
- Fuck Larry.

11:48.584 --> 11:50.787
That dude was garbage.

11:50.820 --> 11:52.321
And I loved him,

11:52.354 --> 11:55.692
and I never told him
that he didn't deserve my love.

11:55.725 --> 11:57.493
So tonight, Larry,

11:57.526 --> 12:02.097
you're gonna get a piece
of this person's noggin.

12:02.131 --> 12:04.333
- Amen.
- Thank you.

12:04.868 --> 12:05.968
Men.

12:06.836 --> 12:09.071
You and Nate...

12:10.774 --> 12:12.709
- could fuck.
- What?

12:12.742 --> 12:14.009
Gonna fuck.

12:14.042 --> 12:15.879
I mean, I don't know
if we're gonna fuck.

12:15.911 --> 12:18.213
You're gonna fuck.

12:18.247 --> 12:19.682
Please stop saying that word,
it's really...

12:19.716 --> 12:21.517
It feels inappropriate.

12:23.753 --> 12:26.255
But yeah, we're gonna fuck.

12:26.288 --> 12:28.290
<i>♪ Didn't mean
To sing that song ♪</i>

12:28.323 --> 12:30.359
<i>♪ Didn't mean to do you wrong ♪</i>

12:30.392 --> 12:32.762
<i>♪ Didn't mean to drag this on ♪</i>

12:32.796 --> 12:34.864
<i>♪ Didn't mean to drag this on ♪</i>

12:34.898 --> 12:37.199
<i>♪ Didn't mean
To sing that song ♪</i>

12:38.200 --> 12:41.370
I love that for you.

12:50.646 --> 12:52.080
Uh, dude...

12:53.683 --> 12:54.983
...where's my car?

12:55.951 --> 12:58.387
Oh, yeah,
it was stolen.

12:59.488 --> 13:01.758
- What?
- Big guy.

13:01.791 --> 13:04.493
Very attractive.

13:04.526 --> 13:06.161
Yeah.

13:06.195 --> 13:08.964
He took it. It's gone. uh...
Very attractive

13:08.997 --> 13:12.167
I saw his whole body
and and his beautiful face.

13:12.201 --> 13:16.271
You know, I could, you know, definitely
identify him, definitely, Yeah, um...

13:16.305 --> 13:19.575
Because it took a while,
you know, to turn on the car,

13:19.608 --> 13:22.644
and he wanted to pair
his phone to the radio,

13:22.679 --> 13:23.579
maybe he had a playlist...

13:23.612 --> 13:26.114
You didn't think to,
like, say something?

13:26.148 --> 13:27.951
Oh, no,
I didn't think about that.

13:27.983 --> 13:29.284
Derrick, man, we're neighbors,

13:29.318 --> 13:31.220
we're supposed to be
looking out for each other.

13:31.253 --> 13:34.791
Yeah, the world's
ending, so I said,

13:34.824 --> 13:38.460
who gives a fuck, anyway,
about any of this shit, you know?

13:38.494 --> 13:42.598
2:00 AM, asteroid hits
and then I...

13:42.631 --> 13:44.132
And gone! Gone!

13:44.166 --> 13:46.034
Yeah, yeah, well,
I mean, you know,

13:46.068 --> 13:48.103
we're all, we're all
in the same boat here.

13:48.136 --> 13:50.072
Why do you need
a car today, anyway?

13:50.105 --> 13:52.174
We have some
very big plans for...

13:52.207 --> 13:53.675
Yeah, we had
a pretty epic day plan

13:53.710 --> 13:56.913
- that could have really used a vehicle.
- Yeah.

13:56.946 --> 13:58.380
All right, then,
we're gonna, uh...

13:58.413 --> 14:01.083
- I guess we're gonna hoof it.
- Okay, hoof away.

14:01.116 --> 14:03.452
- Okay, man.
- Hoof away.

14:05.922 --> 14:08.156
Well, it is
a beautiful day to walk.

14:21.971 --> 14:24.640
The last time we saw Dad was...

14:24.673 --> 14:27.309
I mean, two birthdays ago?

14:27.342 --> 14:29.478
Yeah? I thought
it was last birthday.

14:29.511 --> 14:34.116
No, last birthday,
he had that creative dream workshop.

14:34.149 --> 14:37.219
And the birthday before that,
he took us to all-you-can-eat sushi.

14:37.252 --> 14:38.788
- Oh...
- Hey.

14:39.521 --> 14:41.691
Hi, hello? Yes? No?

14:41.724 --> 14:42.725
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:42.759 --> 14:43.693
You can see me?

14:43.726 --> 14:44.827
Yeah.

14:44.861 --> 14:47.663
- What am I holding?
- Looks like an English muffin.

14:47.697 --> 14:49.732
Okay, what am I doing now?

14:49.766 --> 14:51.935
- Spinning around in circles.
- Spinning in a circle.

14:51.968 --> 14:54.269
Okay. What about now?

14:54.303 --> 14:56.773
- Like a... Like a coy shrug.
- I don't know.

14:56.806 --> 14:58.073
A "coy" shrug?

14:58.106 --> 14:59.308
What about this?

15:01.678 --> 15:04.513
It's like a phone that you're
not interested in using.

15:04.546 --> 15:06.916
Ah, well, hello.

15:06.950 --> 15:08.051
It's great to see you.

15:08.083 --> 15:10.652
And it's great
to be seen, I guess.

15:11.119 --> 15:12.287
I guess so, yeah.

15:12.321 --> 15:14.857
I'm Manny, even though
that's Manny in there.

15:14.891 --> 15:16.525
- He's 92.
- Wow.

15:16.558 --> 15:18.193
Ninety-one?
Something like that, but...

15:18.226 --> 15:20.629
- You're a YS.
- Yeah.

15:20.662 --> 15:21.998
- YS.
- What's happening?

15:22.031 --> 15:23.365
- Younger self.
- Ha-ha.

15:23.398 --> 15:25.200
- Oh, I see. Younger self, I get it.
- Younger self.

15:25.233 --> 15:26.635
No, I got it. I just got it.

15:26.668 --> 15:28.503
Why do you think
everyone can see us today?

15:28.537 --> 15:30.439
- I mean, what?
- I think everyone's just operating

15:30.472 --> 15:32.709
on a higher frequency
or something.

15:32.742 --> 15:34.443
- That makes sense.
- 'Cause it's the last day...

15:34.476 --> 15:36.278
- Right.
- ...so all of a sudden...

15:36.311 --> 15:37.546
Everything's just heightened.

15:37.579 --> 15:39.314
- I think everything is.
- Wow.

15:39.348 --> 15:40.549
This is incredible.

15:40.582 --> 15:42.551
- It's so nice to be seen, you know?
- I know.

15:42.584 --> 15:43.686
Like really seen.

15:43.720 --> 15:46.121
It's the stress of not
being seen that's endless.

15:46.154 --> 15:47.924
When you go into a shop,
try to get service,

15:47.957 --> 15:49.792
- try to get the manager to show up...
- Ugh.

15:49.826 --> 15:51.094
...nothing.

15:51.126 --> 15:54.030
Right. So are you buying clothes
online mostly, then, or...

15:54.063 --> 15:56.933
Uh, honey, we like to shop.

15:56.966 --> 15:58.333
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

15:58.367 --> 16:00.535
What you guys doing tonight?
What's the story?

16:00.569 --> 16:03.672
Sort of, uh, ticking off
regrets one by one, you know.

16:03.706 --> 16:05.407
Better get a rush on that.

16:05.440 --> 16:08.111
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Gonna go see Dad first.

16:10.713 --> 16:12.414
What are you gonna do
the rest of the day?

16:12.447 --> 16:14.017
- I'm gonna finish this sandwich...
- Uh-huh.

16:14.050 --> 16:15.250
- ...make another sandwich...
- Mmm.

16:15.283 --> 16:17.053
...eat that one, take a nap,

16:17.086 --> 16:18.487
- take care of Manny...
- Uh-huh.

16:18.520 --> 16:20.589
...talk to him a little bit
about his memories and stuff.

16:20.622 --> 16:22.224
I might just
walk around the neighborhood.

16:22.257 --> 16:25.094
Oh! So lovely to meet you.

16:25.128 --> 16:26.328
Yeah, it's great
to meet you, too.

16:26.361 --> 16:27.663
Listen, happy last day.

16:27.697 --> 16:29.832
Hey, try to remember me
like this.

16:29.866 --> 16:31.000
No, no.

16:31.034 --> 16:32.835
- That's a joke.
- That's not how you'll die, is it?

16:32.869 --> 16:34.003
Oh, no, no.

16:34.037 --> 16:35.805
- You'll wait to explode like the rest of us.
- Yeah.

16:36.271 --> 16:37.840
Okay, good.

16:37.874 --> 16:39.408
- So nice to meet you.
- Bye, guys, nice to meet you.

16:39.441 --> 16:40.308
Bye.

16:43.345 --> 16:45.447
Okay, let's talk about Dad.

16:45.480 --> 16:47.649
No, it's fine,
we don't need to talk about it.

16:48.583 --> 16:49.852
Oh, my God.

16:50.953 --> 16:52.387
What?

16:52.421 --> 16:54.656
Every time you see him,
you don't have anything prepared,

16:54.691 --> 16:56.625
so you never say any of the
things that you want to.

16:56.658 --> 16:58.061
Well, I didn't realize
that I needed to have,

16:58.094 --> 17:00.029
like,
a PowerPoint presentation.

17:00.063 --> 17:02.832
Ugh, you're so aggravating.

17:02.865 --> 17:05.267
Why are you being so intense?

17:12.307 --> 17:13.710
Let's keep walking.

17:17.412 --> 17:20.083
Sorry, Dad just
gets me riled up.

17:20.116 --> 17:21.616
It's okay, me too.

17:23.752 --> 17:24.618
We'll be fine.

17:25.188 --> 17:26.655
We'll be honest.

17:26.689 --> 17:28.323
Yeah. We'll be fine.

17:33.495 --> 17:34.496
Hey, Dad,

17:34.897 --> 17:35.798
Hi, honey.

17:37.867 --> 17:39.334
You parched?

17:39.367 --> 17:42.004
You look parched.
How about a brew?

17:42.038 --> 17:43.940
You know, I'm brewing
my own brew now.

17:43.973 --> 17:45.808
- I'm actually fine.
- You sure?

17:45.842 --> 17:47.844
- Sure. It's hoppy. It's good stuff.
- Yeah.

17:47.877 --> 17:49.511
Okay.

17:51.748 --> 17:53.248
You talk to your mom?

17:54.483 --> 17:55.184
No.

17:55.218 --> 17:56.686
- I did.
- Really.

17:56.719 --> 17:57.920
Yeah. I zoomed her.

17:58.788 --> 18:00.757
- Wow.
- On the tower.

18:00.790 --> 18:02.859
you know that, huh...

18:02.892 --> 18:04.827
- It's...
- I was sorry.

18:04.861 --> 18:06.528
- Right.
- And...

18:07.295 --> 18:09.966
- I am, you know.
- Sure.

18:09.999 --> 18:12.935
I know that I wasn't...

18:14.569 --> 18:17.173
But you gotta give me
some credit.

18:17.206 --> 18:22.310
I stayed, and she didn't.

18:23.012 --> 18:24.279
And that's...

18:24.312 --> 18:29.584
Well, I mean, she left
and you stayed, but...

18:34.257 --> 18:36.391
I don't know, you were
just never really

18:36.424 --> 18:38.493
there to begin with.

18:39.594 --> 18:42.932
You just kind
of checked out, man. You were...

18:44.267 --> 18:45.802
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:45.835 --> 18:47.703
Yes, Yes, this is...

18:48.336 --> 18:50.572
I want you to know that I...

18:50.605 --> 18:54.777
I didn't... I didn't want to do
what I did.

18:55.845 --> 19:00.448
I wanted someone
who wasn't your mother.

19:01.851 --> 19:04.519
And I...
And I didn't have the courage

19:04.553 --> 19:09.959
to leave, and it broke her.

19:11.660 --> 19:12.561
Yeah.

19:13.361 --> 19:15.932
And that is... That's on me.

19:18.600 --> 19:22.404
I was just really scared, Dad.

19:23.538 --> 19:28.144
I know, I mean, I didn't know.
But I know. I know.

19:28.177 --> 19:31.881
I felt really alone,
all the time.

19:32.647 --> 19:34.449
Even when you were there.

19:35.685 --> 19:40.323
And as much I didn't wanna be,
I was like the parent.

19:40.355 --> 19:42.357
And that's really
fucking hard, man.

19:43.292 --> 19:45.460
I could never be the kid.

19:46.996 --> 19:49.564
Could be that, be that now?

19:51.234 --> 19:52.601
What?

19:52.634 --> 19:55.137
Anything you wanna get rid of.

19:55.171 --> 19:59.275
I want...
I want you to give it to me.

19:59.308 --> 20:01.878
- For real?
- Yeah. Yeah, absolutely,

20:01.911 --> 20:03.545
Okay. Whoa.

20:04.914 --> 20:07.482
I... The body
has to take so much in.

20:07.515 --> 20:09.618
You know,
it has to take so much in.

20:09.651 --> 20:11.486
And we don't always know
how to handle it.

20:11.519 --> 20:14.023
Like on a cellular level.

20:14.056 --> 20:19.295
And so it just rattles around
like this energy pinball.

20:19.328 --> 20:21.864
I like to call it
the dense body.

20:21.898 --> 20:24.333
Feel it, Feel it.
Where is it? Where is it?

20:24.367 --> 20:26.736
It lives in there.
Do it with me. Feel it.

20:26.769 --> 20:29.739
Feel it Where is it?
Where's it hurt?

20:30.239 --> 20:31.406
Smash it out.

20:31.439 --> 20:33.276
Give it all. Come on,
give it all to me, Liza.

20:33.309 --> 20:34.944
Give it all.
Give it all. Come on.

20:34.977 --> 20:37.246
- Standing, okay.
- Come on.

20:37.280 --> 20:39.048
Oh-oh, what's that now?

20:39.081 --> 20:41.150
Give it to me. Give it all.

20:41.183 --> 20:42.251
Give it all. Yeah!

20:42.285 --> 20:44.820
- Oh-oh. Okay.
- Ho! Ho!

20:44.854 --> 20:47.589
I want it all so you don't
have to carry it anymore.

20:47.622 --> 20:50.826
Because it is... It is mine!

20:50.860 --> 20:51.961
Give it to me!

20:51.994 --> 20:53.528
Give it to me.

20:53.561 --> 20:55.898
Give it to me.

20:55.932 --> 20:59.702
Give it to me.

21:02.238 --> 21:04.941
Yeah, yeah!

21:08.844 --> 21:09.712
Ohh...

21:10.445 --> 21:11.446
Whew.

21:11.479 --> 21:13.149
Thanks, Dad.

21:13.182 --> 21:16.686
I'm gonna drive to the ocean,
set sail on the open sea,

21:16.719 --> 21:18.586
swim naked with dolphins.

21:19.521 --> 21:22.825
- You wanna come?
- No. I'm good.

21:22.858 --> 21:27.229
Yeah, Maybe you can just
be the kid tonight, huh?

21:34.370 --> 21:35.503
Who's that?

21:40.276 --> 21:41.476
Bye, Dad.

21:42.211 --> 21:43.245
Bye, Dad.

21:50.618 --> 21:53.990
Whoo-hoo! Whoo!

21:59.762 --> 22:02.597
So, should we talk
about mom yet?

22:05.101 --> 22:06.501
No, not yet.

22:25.287 --> 22:26.554
It's a little on the nose.

22:29.425 --> 22:30.558
Let's go.

22:31.827 --> 22:33.628
<i>My mom called me today.</i>

22:33.661 --> 22:36.065
<i>And she said, "Sweetie,
the world's ending,</i>

22:36.098 --> 22:38.633
<i>and everything's going crazy.
What's going on?"</i>

22:38.666 --> 22:40.535
<i>And I said "Yeah, it's too bad.</i>

22:40.568 --> 22:41.771
<i>You know, it is what it is."</i>

22:41.804 --> 22:44.507
<i>She said "You seem
pretty calm about this."</i>

22:44.539 --> 22:48.711
<i>Well, yeah. Every time you call me
feels like the end of the world.</i>

22:48.744 --> 22:51.247
<i>Uh, do we have
any administrative assistants</i>

22:51.280 --> 22:52.415
<i>in the house?</i>

22:52.448 --> 22:54.616
<i>Make some noise
if you have bureaucracy.</i>

22:54.649 --> 22:56.752
<i>Come on, make some
noise, people. Come on.</i>

22:56.786 --> 23:00.056
<i>Hi. Hey. How you guys
doing tonight?</i>

23:00.089 --> 23:01.623
- Good.
- Uh, yeah.

23:01.656 --> 23:03.225
You know, as good as we can be.

23:03.259 --> 23:05.461
<i>Alright. Uh, what do you do?</i>

23:05.494 --> 23:08.431
Um, I invented an app,
and I sold it.

23:08.464 --> 23:10.499
She's actually
a very gifted coder.

23:10.533 --> 23:13.469
<i>Okay. Got a little woman
in STEM over here.</i>

23:13.502 --> 23:16.439
<i>Let's make some noise
for women in STEM.</i>

23:17.873 --> 23:18.874
<i>Awesome.</i>

23:18.908 --> 23:21.143
<i>This is kind of my first time
doing this,</i>

23:21.177 --> 23:22.311
<i>If I'm being honest.</i>

23:22.344 --> 23:25.981
<i>I've been a teacher in the
LA public school system.</i>

23:26.015 --> 23:29.218
<i>But I've always dreamed
of being a standup. So...</i>

23:29.251 --> 23:30.486
<i>This kid asked me</i>

23:30.519 --> 23:31.653
<i>"What's the homework today?"</i>

23:31.687 --> 23:33.655
<i>I said,
"Do whatever you want."</i>

23:33.689 --> 23:36.658
<i>You know, there's no
assignment today.</i>

23:36.692 --> 23:37.960
<i>Everything is, um...</i>

23:37.993 --> 23:40.162
Yeah, the only assignment
is death.

23:43.032 --> 23:45.768
<i>Well, that's...
That's sort of been my time.</i>

23:46.702 --> 23:49.839
<i>Thanks! Thank you.
Pretty cool.</i>

23:49.872 --> 23:53.909
<i>Um, well, listen, I'll be here
uh, all night,</i>

23:53.943 --> 23:56.412
<i>however long the night lasts.</i>

23:56.445 --> 23:58.948
<i>So... Hey where are you from?</i>

24:03.686 --> 24:06.021
Wait. Is that the same dude?

24:09.525 --> 24:10.926
Yeah, keep walking.

not expecting this

25:35.679 --> 25:37.780
when we were
walking up this street.

25:38.614 --> 25:40.349
That was fucking incredible.

25:40.382 --> 25:42.718
If you had a hat down
I would give you all my money.

25:43.285 --> 25:44.286
If I had any.

25:44.320 --> 25:45.921
I started off busking

25:45.955 --> 25:48.257
and I figured this would be
a way to go.

25:48.290 --> 25:50.192
- So beautiful.
- Love it.

25:50.226 --> 25:51.026
Thank you.

25:51.060 --> 25:52.628
Well, it means a lot
that you're here

25:52.661 --> 25:54.096
to hear this song

25:54.129 --> 25:57.266
because I wrote it
as a as a duet.

25:57.299 --> 25:59.401
- Oh, no way.
- Yeah.

25:59.435 --> 26:00.502
For my friend Rita.

26:00.536 --> 26:02.371
Oh, cool.

26:02.638 --> 26:03.505
Yeah.

26:04.406 --> 26:06.976
She, uh, um, she's passed away.

26:07.009 --> 26:11.947
And so, um, I haven't been able
to sing it with her, but...

26:11.981 --> 26:14.283
Would you
wanna sing it with me?

26:14.316 --> 26:15.951
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Yeah.

26:15.985 --> 26:17.553
- No, thank you.
- That'll be fun.

26:17.586 --> 26:18.821
- C'mon.
- No, no, please. No.

26:18.854 --> 26:20.756
She's so good.

26:20.789 --> 26:22.157
No, no, I really...

26:22.191 --> 26:25.127
She used to be in a band
in High School.

26:25.160 --> 26:26.862
When is there
ever a better day?

26:26.895 --> 26:28.297
- It's true.
- Yeah.

26:28.330 --> 26:31.400
Today is certainly just
the fuck it of all days.

26:32.768 --> 26:34.738
- Just a fucking song, so.
- Okay.

26:34.770 --> 26:36.905
- Why don't you sing?
- Okay.

26:36.939 --> 26:40.075
- She's... She's good.
- I'll help then.

26:40.109 --> 26:42.411
You'll do it?
You'll both do it?

26:42.444 --> 26:43.779
I'll get there. I'll get there.

26:43.812 --> 26:45.114

28:38.460 --> 28:41.296
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

28:41.330 --> 28:45.033
It's a shame. I feel like
we could've been great friends.

28:45.367 --> 28:47.002
I know.

28:47.035 --> 28:51.140
Well, um well,
maybe the next one.

28:52.674 --> 28:54.410
Yeah, maybe
I'll just see you later.

28:57.714 --> 28:59.415
- Bye.
- Bye, thank you.

29:02.918 --> 29:04.186
C'mon.

29:05.554 --> 29:07.523
Okay, next up...

29:10.359 --> 29:12.261
Man, I really fucked up.

29:12.862 --> 29:14.196
Just been a shitty friend,

29:14.229 --> 29:17.332
just been self-absorbed
and stubborn.

29:18.600 --> 29:20.669
She did kind of worry
about it, you know.

29:20.703 --> 29:22.204
Yeah, and I wouldn't hear it.

29:22.237 --> 29:24.072
Let the dude get in the middle.

29:24.908 --> 29:26.475
Really good thing.

29:27.075 --> 29:30.279
How very 1990's of me.

29:30.312 --> 29:33.081
She wasn't completely
innocent either, though.

29:34.349 --> 29:38.020
Aww.
I love this side of you.

29:43.125 --> 29:45.127
Yeah. I don't think
I can do this.

29:45.695 --> 29:48.430
What? Yes, you can.

29:48.464 --> 29:50.432
It's just... It's gonna be
so uncomfortable, man.

29:50.466 --> 29:53.068
And like, who knows
if she even wants to see me?

29:53.101 --> 29:54.303
This was a terrible idea.

29:54.336 --> 29:55.671
Honestly, I don't know
why I even listen to you.

29:55.705 --> 29:57.139
Oh, my God.

29:57.172 --> 29:59.241
When have I
ever steered you wrong?

30:00.609 --> 30:03.111
I don't know. I've never really
let you steer before.

30:03.746 --> 30:05.414
I got you.

30:28.303 --> 30:29.906
- Listen.
- It's done... It's.

30:29.939 --> 30:32.174
- Sorry.
- You go.

30:32.207 --> 30:33.442
- Okay, it's that...
- I just feel that...

30:34.343 --> 30:35.344
Sorry.

30:35.377 --> 30:37.212
You go.

30:37.246 --> 30:39.248
I feel like you weren't
really listening to me

30:39.281 --> 30:41.985
when I was trying to explain
to you what you are worth.

30:42.017 --> 30:43.051
- I know.
- But you wanted

30:43.085 --> 30:44.353
something different
for yourself.

30:44.386 --> 30:46.488
I was like a lesser version
of myself at the time.

30:46.522 --> 30:50.058
- You were.
- And actually embarrassed. You know what I mean.

30:50.092 --> 30:53.028
- ...kind of subpar.
- Say my truth for a second,

30:53.061 --> 30:54.062
Yes, I want that.

30:54.096 --> 30:55.798
You also sort of abandoned me.

30:55.832 --> 30:58.400
- That abandonment was part of it.
- It was so annoying

30:58.433 --> 31:00.870
to be the friend with
the shitty dude.

31:00.904 --> 31:04.673
But you were with the shitty dude.
He was the worst...

31:04.707 --> 31:06.675
And you're feeling were...

31:06.709 --> 31:09.746
And that is why I feel like
I need you to recognize

31:09.779 --> 31:11.246
how I was
developing psychically,

31:11.280 --> 31:13.181
which you didn't really
pay attention to.

31:13.215 --> 31:16.351
And that is an ability that
I scoffed at for a long time.

31:16.385 --> 31:18.253
And that was something I was
trying to use for your benefit.

31:18.287 --> 31:20.422
- ...wanted you to see it.
- And I know that now.

31:23.125 --> 31:25.160
- Thank you.
- That makes a lot of sense.

31:25.193 --> 31:27.931
I, like... I actually
feel so heard.

31:27.964 --> 31:29.565
- I do too.
- Thank you for hearing me.

31:29.598 --> 31:30.599
Wow.

31:30.632 --> 31:31.734
- Wow.
- Wow.

31:31.768 --> 31:33.402
I have a literally been saying
that in my head

31:33.435 --> 31:35.170
- for like seven years.
- Years.

31:35.203 --> 31:36.973
- I was so scared...
- I was so scared of you.

31:37.006 --> 31:38.674
I was so sacred,
you were so scary.

31:38.708 --> 31:39.675
That's why I'm on the street.

31:39.709 --> 31:41.109
That time, honestly
I saw you on the street

31:41.143 --> 31:42.077
- and I didn't walk up to you, so weird.
- No!

31:42.110 --> 31:43.345
I saw you
and I was like, "Oh!"

31:43.378 --> 31:45.581
I lost it and I was just like,
what is this life?

31:45.614 --> 31:48.584
I just want go talk to you
because like...

31:48.617 --> 31:50.419
- I know.
- Friend, you're my best friend.

31:50.452 --> 31:53.056
- You were like a limb.
- That kills me, dude.

31:53.088 --> 31:55.324
You saw me and that
you couldn't say hi to me

31:55.357 --> 31:57.259
because I was such a dick.

31:57.292 --> 31:58.527
...talking to a stupid girl,

31:58.560 --> 32:00.629
and I was like
is that your friend?

32:00.662 --> 32:02.531
No, I don't have any.

32:02.564 --> 32:03.700
I don't either.

32:03.733 --> 32:07.202
I've just been sitting
in the drudge of solitude.

32:07.235 --> 32:09.806
And I was seeing
that because I...

32:09.839 --> 32:11.373
You've a gift.

32:11.406 --> 32:12.809
And honestly like,
I don't want to brag about it.

32:12.842 --> 32:14.844
I don't need to be like
I have this thing, but like...

32:14.877 --> 32:16.079
I haven't witnessed it.

32:16.111 --> 32:17.714
But I'm just I'm hearing you
tell me that.

32:17.747 --> 32:19.414
And if you tell me that,
then I believe you.

32:19.448 --> 32:23.218
I have developed
psychically to the place

32:23.251 --> 32:25.487
where I am capable
of extraordinary things.

32:25.520 --> 32:27.155
And it doesn't come
without hard work.

32:27.189 --> 32:30.192
I trained, you know,
I'm Reiki one certified.

32:30.225 --> 32:32.461
- Wow!
- Yeah, that just came in the mail.

32:32.494 --> 32:33.997
But, like everyone
is operating on this,

32:34.030 --> 32:35.297
like other level today,

32:35.330 --> 32:37.132
- Up here.
- ...and I see now

32:37.165 --> 32:40.036
your gift is real,
and I am sorry.

32:40.069 --> 32:42.504
You see the future, man,
that is cool.

32:42.537 --> 32:43.605
It's crazy.

32:43.639 --> 32:46.109
And so when I knew that Larry
was a piece of shit

32:46.141 --> 32:47.609
and he... Honestly like,
I'm sorry,

32:47.643 --> 32:49.311
I feel like now we can take
space from it

32:49.344 --> 32:50.512
and see that he was.

32:50.545 --> 32:52.581
- The fucking worst!
- He was a trash person.

32:52.614 --> 32:54.784
- I know.
- Whatever happened to Nate?

32:54.817 --> 32:56.385
Remember Nate? He was good.

32:56.418 --> 32:57.720
It's funny you should
ask about Nate.

32:57.754 --> 32:59.488
Well, there's so much
to catch up on.

32:59.521 --> 33:01.824
Some shit went down
after we stopped speaking.

33:01.858 --> 33:04.493
We got drunk... Oh, you know.
Oh fuck, of course you know.

33:04.526 --> 33:06.461
I want you to go through it
with me

33:06.495 --> 33:08.597
because it's helpful
as confirmation

33:08.630 --> 33:10.365
almost for like,
how I practice?

33:10.399 --> 33:13.268
Sure. So we got very drunk
one night,

33:13.301 --> 33:18.240
and, um, he end up like
telling me

33:18.273 --> 33:19.408
that he loved me.

33:19.441 --> 33:21.911
He loved you. Oh, my God.

33:21.944 --> 33:23.746
And to come out of that mouth.

33:23.780 --> 33:26.082
- I know.
- With those eyes.

33:26.115 --> 33:29.418
- It was like la-la-la-la-la.
- God

33:29.451 --> 33:30.485
And then we end up, like,

33:30.519 --> 33:31.620
of course, like,
hooking up a little bit.

33:31.653 --> 33:34.523
- And it was fireworks.
- Fucking beyond.

33:34.556 --> 33:36.591
- Dynamite.
- Earthquakes.

33:37.994 --> 33:39.361
- And then I freaked out.
- Yeah.

33:39.394 --> 33:42.297
And I shut down
and pushed him away.

33:42.330 --> 33:43.432
And he was so vulnerable

33:43.465 --> 33:45.068
that of course,
he was, like, humiliated.

33:45.101 --> 33:46.401
And then it just made
everything so weird.

33:46.435 --> 33:47.502
We couldn't be friends any more

33:47.536 --> 33:48.670
then he started
dating somebody else.

33:48.705 --> 33:49.671
What happened?

33:49.706 --> 33:51.306
- Remind me. I mean.
- I saw him.

33:51.339 --> 33:52.541
- Yup.
- Today.

33:52.574 --> 33:55.310
- Hmm-mm
- After years of not speaking.

33:55.343 --> 33:58.114
But he also was like,
I'm going to Mandy's party.

33:58.147 --> 34:00.615
I'd like to tell Nate that I...

34:01.784 --> 34:02.819
- Love him.
- Love him.

34:02.852 --> 34:04.653
- I've always been in love with him.
- Yes!

34:04.687 --> 34:07.757
The time is now
because I got to tell you,

34:07.790 --> 34:10.793
your after life
is honestly unfair.

34:10.827 --> 34:12.393
It is unjust how good it is.

34:12.427 --> 34:14.831
Like I can't. Woo! I wanna,
kind of wanna tell you,

34:14.864 --> 34:17.599
but I don't want to fuck it up
because of no ripple effect.

34:17.632 --> 34:19.702
No, you obviously
have to tell me now.

34:19.735 --> 34:22.304
I'm gonna tell you one word,
just one word.

34:24.272 --> 34:25.507
Chalamet.

34:26.507 --> 34:28.945
- Shut up.
- Life partners.

34:28.978 --> 34:30.980
- No. For life?
- Life partners.

34:31.013 --> 34:32.246
For life, for that life.

34:32.280 --> 34:34.183
- In the afterlife?
- In the afterlife.

34:34.217 --> 34:36.551
- Timothee.
- Timothee.

34:37.687 --> 34:38.755
Chalamet.

34:40.589 --> 34:41.690
Wow!

34:41.724 --> 34:47.329
Also, I see a lot of dairy,
with zero consequences.

34:47.362 --> 34:50.766
I am lactose tolerant
and fucking Timmy.

34:50.800 --> 34:51.666
That's right.

34:51.701 --> 34:54.536
- Holy shit.
- Thank you for coming by.

34:54.569 --> 34:56.005
Thank you for receiving me.

34:56.038 --> 34:58.975
Uh, you're so fucking stupid.
I love you so much.

34:59.008 --> 35:02.544
You're so stupid. I love you.
You're fucked, Okay.

35:03.345 --> 35:05.413
- Bye.
- Bye.

35:15.057 --> 35:16.324
Fucking nightmare.

35:17.927 --> 35:18.761
That was cool.

35:18.795 --> 35:21.329
- She is so great.
- She is the coolest.

35:21.363 --> 35:24.466
- Feels so good to be honest, you know.
- Right?

35:25.034 --> 35:26.169
You were so scared,

35:26.202 --> 35:28.470
I mean, so scared
to confront things.

35:28.503 --> 35:32.909
And then it's like,
who's direct? This guy.

35:34.110 --> 35:35.610
Hey, can I be direct?

35:35.644 --> 35:36.712
Sure.

35:36.746 --> 35:38.580
Please stop
walking in front of me.

35:38.613 --> 35:40.448
I'm not walking
in front of you.

35:43.652 --> 35:44.954
Thank you.

35:44.987 --> 35:46.022
See, I like this.

35:47.190 --> 35:48.724
I like being next to you.

35:53.863 --> 35:56.364
- Where're you going?
- You gotta stay next to me.

35:56.398 --> 35:57.900
- No.
- C'mon.

35:58.633 --> 35:59.735
C'mon.

36:02.470 --> 36:05.942
Oh, she burns. She burns good.

36:14.050 --> 36:15.117
Is that Mandy?

36:23.993 --> 36:25.094
It can't be.

36:25.127 --> 36:26.796
- No.
- I don't think so.

36:27.429 --> 36:28.798
She's home. She's preparing.

36:36.371 --> 36:38.341
Okay, who's next?

36:38.373 --> 36:39.909
Larry.

36:42.945 --> 36:44.780
Hey. Hi.

36:44.814 --> 36:47.817
Sorry. Um, do you know
if the Getty's opened today?

36:47.850 --> 36:49.118
Uh?

36:51.988 --> 36:52.855
Liza?

36:54.257 --> 36:55.423
It's Sal.

36:55.457 --> 36:59.461
Sal Benedetti.

36:59.494 --> 37:00.830
First kiss.

37:02.064 --> 37:03.332
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

37:03.366 --> 37:05.835
- By the...
- ...yeah.

37:05.868 --> 37:09.939
- Cast party.
- Cast party for the Music Man!

37:09.972 --> 37:13.541
I wouldn't have recognized.
But you really uh...

37:14.409 --> 37:16.411
- I grew up.
- You have grown up.

37:16.444 --> 37:17.847
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

37:17.880 --> 37:20.783
You were so good in theater.
Whatever, did anything happen?

37:20.816 --> 37:23.386
Thank you. No, I...
You know I do sex therapy

37:23.418 --> 37:26.588
I do climax
therapy specifically.

37:26.621 --> 37:29.025
I help couples
who are having block

37:29.058 --> 37:30.893
sort of reach climax.

37:30.927 --> 37:33.796
And today's been busy.

37:33.829 --> 37:35.965
Is it a sort of a water based?

37:35.998 --> 37:39.769
No. I had a client that wanted
to make love in the pool.

37:39.802 --> 37:43.205
So I was there
to sort of facilitate.

37:43.239 --> 37:44.840
So you're in the water
with them?

37:44.874 --> 37:48.210
I was... Not every client
needs me to be that close,

37:48.244 --> 37:50.578
but I do dip in for some. Yeah.

37:50.612 --> 37:52.715
- You dip in?
- Yeah. I, uh, yeah.

37:52.748 --> 37:54.549
But you don't "dip in"?

37:54.582 --> 37:55.718
No, no, no, no.

37:55.751 --> 37:57.219
I don't partake
in the love making though.

37:58.520 --> 38:00.690
- Wow,
- It's so insane to see you.

38:00.723 --> 38:03.658
Wow, what a pleasure
to see you in...

38:03.693 --> 38:05.560
In the flesh, in so much flesh.

38:06.062 --> 38:07.096
Thank you.

38:07.897 --> 38:08.931
Sal Benedetti.

38:08.965 --> 38:12.001
Listen, when you do
go out tonight,

38:13.635 --> 38:16.772
really breathe through it
and let whatever comes...

38:17.740 --> 38:18.774
Come.

38:19.208 --> 38:20.142
Thank you.

38:21.177 --> 38:23.980
Welcome. And that's for free

38:25.513 --> 38:27.649
- All right. Wow.
- Wow.

38:28.751 --> 38:30.686
- See you, Sal.
- Bye, Liza.

38:32.254 --> 38:33.488
See you in the next one.

38:33.521 --> 38:35.758
I hope so. And you know what?
You will.

38:37.960 --> 38:38.961
Rock on.

38:44.300 --> 38:46.568
Man, Sal Benedetti.

38:47.669 --> 38:49.537
You had
terrible taste in men.

38:49.571 --> 38:50.940
Yeah, truly.

38:52.607 --> 38:55.711
- Hey, can I tell you a secret?
- Mmm-hmm.

38:55.745 --> 38:58.580
I considered fucking
that dude in the tent today.

38:58.613 --> 38:59.749
What?

39:01.350 --> 39:02.685
Jesus, dude.

39:03.452 --> 39:05.154
Honestly, what is your type?

39:05.187 --> 39:07.356
Oh, you know,
anyone who will give me

39:07.390 --> 39:08.858
a modicum of attention,

39:08.891 --> 39:11.093
paired with a promise
of rejection.

39:11.127 --> 39:13.863
A little seductive,
a little sociopathic.

39:13.896 --> 39:17.532
You know, someone who could
potentially love me,

39:17.565 --> 39:18.600
but also prove to me

39:18.633 --> 39:20.668
that ultimately,
I'm unworthy of love.

39:21.837 --> 39:23.305
I don't believe that.

39:24.507 --> 39:26.442
Oh, no.

39:26.475 --> 39:27.910
You wanna be loved.

39:29.412 --> 39:31.747
Like, really loved.

39:33.783 --> 39:36.685
Today we take no prisoners,

39:36.719 --> 39:39.055
today we see
what that looks like.

39:40.489 --> 39:42.958

What the...

40:28.170 --> 40:29.371
They say go with vintage.

40:29.405 --> 40:31.807
Go with vintage. You couldn't
just get a Bluetooth speaker

40:36.579 --> 40:37.713
Fuck this.

40:45.554 --> 40:46.689
Hey!

40:47.790 --> 40:50.059
- Hey.
- You're not using this anymore?

40:51.193 --> 40:52.094
No.

40:53.262 --> 40:54.196
Cool.

41:12.181 --> 41:13.983
Hey, Liza.

41:14.016 --> 41:15.384
You here to tell me
you love me.

41:15.818 --> 41:19.321
No, I'm here to

41:22.424 --> 41:27.429
to remind you of the mess

41:28.397 --> 41:30.900
you left when you went away.

41:30.933 --> 41:33.969
Because it's not fair, dude,

41:34.003 --> 41:39.308
to deny me of the cross I bear

41:40.442 --> 41:42.077
that you fucking gave to me.

41:42.378 --> 41:43.312
Right.

41:44.346 --> 41:45.681
That makes a lot of sense.

41:45.714 --> 41:46.782
And I hear you.

41:46.815 --> 41:48.484
I hear everything you're saying

41:48.517 --> 41:50.986
because there's nothing
coming out of those speakers.

41:51.020 --> 41:52.788
I know, I found it
on the street

41:52.821 --> 41:54.323
but I thought it was
a cool visual.

41:54.356 --> 41:57.359
- Okay.
- I think it's broken.

41:57.393 --> 41:59.261
I'm on my way down. Can I
get you anything to drink?

41:59.728 --> 42:01.230
No, I'm fine.

42:01.263 --> 42:03.766
Not a seltzer water, flaming hot
Cheetos, something like that.

42:03.799 --> 42:05.935
No, I don't eat Cheetos, man.

42:05.968 --> 42:07.536
You know that about me?

42:07.570 --> 42:09.805
Those bright ass lips. You've
been eating something red.

42:10.573 --> 42:12.841
I love you. Okay.

42:14.810 --> 42:15.945
He said he loved me.

42:19.548 --> 42:24.620
Larry, I feel like I never got
the opportunity to tell you

42:24.653 --> 42:27.089
that you really hurt me,
you know?

42:27.122 --> 42:29.693
And like what we had was real,

42:29.725 --> 42:31.026
and you made me feel
like it wasn't real.

42:31.060 --> 42:32.895
And when you just, like,
ghost a person

42:32.928 --> 42:34.997
and don't respond to
any of my texts,

42:35.030 --> 42:38.534
like I had no closure on us.

42:38.567 --> 42:40.603
That's right. No, closure.

42:40.636 --> 42:41.971
I think it's important
to have closure,

42:42.004 --> 42:43.305
and you didn't get that
from me.

42:43.339 --> 42:45.808
I'm here. I'm here
lay it on me, let me receive.

42:45.841 --> 42:47.876
You know, this has been
happening all day.

42:48.277 --> 42:49.345
This?

42:49.378 --> 42:51.046
Yeah, girls coming over
and telling me like it is.

42:51.880 --> 42:54.283
Yes, I did cheat on you,
seven times.

42:54.316 --> 42:57.419
Seven times? You told me
you cheated on me two times.

42:58.454 --> 43:00.623
Uh, yeah, with women, yeah.

43:00.656 --> 43:02.191
But it's not about
the number, okay?

43:02.224 --> 43:04.860
It's about what we did in those
positions that we did it in.

43:04.893 --> 43:06.595
Sure, you don't like
to get weird?

43:06.629 --> 43:08.430
You don't like to play
with my butt,

43:08.464 --> 43:10.833
and they do, and that's fine,

43:10.866 --> 43:13.135
because that's not
what you're into, okay?

43:13.168 --> 43:14.970
You don't like to get weird
on the brown line.

43:15.504 --> 43:16.772
No, I don't.

43:16.805 --> 43:18.874
I don't travel
on the brown line.

43:18.907 --> 43:21.777
And that's one of my main forms
of transportation.

43:21.810 --> 43:23.312
And the women
that I cheated on you

43:23.345 --> 43:25.781
and some of the others,
they knew that about me.

43:25.814 --> 43:27.383
And I was just getting
some things out.

43:27.416 --> 43:28.651
The time we went to Anguilla.

43:28.685 --> 43:30.252
We never went to Anguilla.

43:32.121 --> 43:33.723
Yeah, I know we never
went to...

43:33.757 --> 43:36.158
I was saying, like, in a...

43:37.092 --> 43:38.627
We never went to... You didn't?

43:38.661 --> 43:40.195
No!

43:40.229 --> 43:42.231
I tried to take us on a
vacation for our anniversary.

43:42.264 --> 43:46.802
You said that you had to work,
and then I walked in on you...

43:46.835 --> 43:47.836
Putting that work in.

43:47.870 --> 43:48.971
Yeah, you were working.

43:49.004 --> 43:51.807
Look, we never
went on vacation, okay?

43:51.840 --> 43:53.842
You definitely asked me to.

43:53.876 --> 43:58.213
And when you come home,
you find me going to town on some lady.

43:58.247 --> 44:00.717
That's low.

44:00.750 --> 44:02.117
- Yeah.
- That's very low.

44:02.151 --> 44:04.153
You're just repeating
shit I say.

44:04.186 --> 44:07.222
Ain't that like me?
To just repeat things you say.

44:07.256 --> 44:08.792
- Yes.
- I'm ashamed of me.

44:08.824 --> 44:11.060
Because I'm not just cheating
on you, I'm cheating on myself,

44:11.093 --> 44:13.829
and I'm cheating on the people
that count on me the most.

44:13.862 --> 44:16.465
Don't do that. Don't do that with
your voice. You're not crying.

44:16.498 --> 44:18.802
It's not you, okay. It's one...

44:18.834 --> 44:20.402
It's partly you but it's me.

44:20.436 --> 44:23.138
No, it's me because it's we.

44:23.939 --> 44:24.973
It's all of us, really.

44:25.007 --> 44:26.275
What world are we living in?

44:26.308 --> 44:29.278
Uh, we got to get it together
as a people.

44:29.311 --> 44:30.913
We got to stand up.

44:31.547 --> 44:33.115
And we got to say no!

44:33.683 --> 44:34.718
To what?

44:34.751 --> 44:36.786
Temptation, also
The Temptations.

44:36.820 --> 44:40.556
If you put Temptations on when a lady
walks through this door, panties drop.

44:40.589 --> 44:43.659
Larry! Get down here, Larry.
I need to talk to you.

44:43.693 --> 44:45.729
I got to get some things
off my chest.

44:45.762 --> 44:47.596
- Larry? You hiding?
- Yeah, he's here.

44:47.629 --> 44:48.530
No, I'm not hiding.

44:48.564 --> 44:50.666
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

44:50.700 --> 44:53.770
I have some things that I
need to get off my chest.

44:53.803 --> 44:55.772
You know what?

44:55.805 --> 44:59.341
And all I'm going to say is I walked that brown
fine line and it was not worth it, okay?

44:59.375 --> 45:01.745
That's actually very good for
me to hear because I didn't.

45:01.778 --> 45:03.045
You're welcome.

45:03.078 --> 45:04.279
And I've sort of regretted it
because I felt like

45:04.313 --> 45:06.448
if I could have held that space
for you,

45:06.482 --> 45:07.684
that butt play space...

45:07.717 --> 45:11.353
What we need to do in a time
like this is come together.

45:12.221 --> 45:15.624
Black, white, brown,
purple or Asian.

45:15.657 --> 45:17.126
Puerto Rican or Haitian.

45:17.159 --> 45:19.962
Huh, I don't give a damn
if you're from the Zulu nation.

45:19.995 --> 45:21.563
What are you talking about?

45:21.597 --> 45:24.066
I was... Those were, is an amalgam
of lyrics from multiple songs.

45:24.099 --> 45:25.501
I came here to do this,
I got to go.

45:25.534 --> 45:26.935
- Yeah, do it.
- I need an apology.

45:26.969 --> 45:28.504
You treated me
like a side piece.

45:28.537 --> 45:29.571
You said I was the main piece.

45:29.605 --> 45:30.906
- Okay, I...
- And that trip to Anguilla,

45:30.939 --> 45:31.841
you said to my face...

45:31.875 --> 45:33.777
She went to Anguilla.

45:33.810 --> 45:37.012
You were the one from Anguilla. I thought...
You're right. You didn't go to Anguilla.

45:37.045 --> 45:38.147
Yeah, I know, Larry!

45:38.180 --> 45:39.081
Okay.

45:49.191 --> 45:51.427
I can't believe
you were into that guy.

45:51.460 --> 45:53.195
I know.

45:53.228 --> 45:56.031
What can I say?
I'm a sucker for compliments.

45:56.064 --> 45:58.267
And he was like,
strangely good at that,

45:58.701 --> 46:00.202
and I don't know,

46:01.036 --> 46:02.371
hard to come by.

46:04.741 --> 46:06.375
I compliment you all the time.

46:07.543 --> 46:09.244
You don't count.

46:09.278 --> 46:10.646
Stop saying
I don't count.

46:13.148 --> 46:14.616
Uh, okay, let's shake it off.

46:22.591 --> 46:23.459
Three down.

46:24.727 --> 46:25.594
Three down.

47:17.914 --> 47:19.214
- God bless you.
- God bless you.

47:22.351 --> 47:25.420
- It's unsanitary.
- It doesn't matter.

47:25.454 --> 47:27.857
It's unsanitary
and it encourages racoons.

47:27.891 --> 47:30.793
Excuse me, ma'am.
Can I ask you two a question?

47:30.827 --> 47:33.730
Do you think that the garbage is
going to be collected tomorrow?

47:33.763 --> 47:34.663
Do you think
that the garbage...

47:34.697 --> 47:35.798
You don't know these people.

47:35.832 --> 47:37.266
No.

47:37.299 --> 47:39.334
Yeah, I'm going to say,
like a 100% chance of not coming.

47:39.368 --> 47:42.939
All I ask is that you rinse your recycling.
You probably rinse your recycling.

47:42.972 --> 47:43.973
No one does that.

47:44.007 --> 47:45.008
Do you do it?
Do you rinse it out.

47:45.040 --> 47:46.041
You should.

47:46.074 --> 47:48.477
Well, I know that I am
supposed to,

47:48.510 --> 47:50.880
but I do have a lot of guilt
that I don't.

47:50.914 --> 47:53.016
Let me tell you something.
This is all a big hoax, okay?

47:53.048 --> 47:55.350
The world is not ending, okay?

47:55.384 --> 47:58.220
There is no such thing
as NASA, okay?

47:58.253 --> 48:01.791
Don't you think they would have come
up with a better name than NASA?

48:01.824 --> 48:05.594
Okay, you actually believe the
animations that you see on the news?

48:05.627 --> 48:06.528
You think that's real?

48:06.562 --> 48:07.362
It is real.

48:07.396 --> 48:09.799
Do the math. It's all fake.

48:09.832 --> 48:11.400
All of that was fake.

48:11.433 --> 48:12.835
The moon landing was faked.

48:12.869 --> 48:14.169
The meteor is fake.

48:14.202 --> 48:15.237
I have a quick question.

48:15.270 --> 48:16.706
And then we do have to be
on our way.

48:16.739 --> 48:17.573
What?

48:17.606 --> 48:21.911
So you are, uh,
an environmentalist

48:21.945 --> 48:25.048
who also denies science?

48:25.080 --> 48:26.248
That's right, lady.

48:26.281 --> 48:30.218
Science is bullshit, okay.
I'm also stressed.

48:30.252 --> 48:31.988
It's an intense day,
and emotions run high.

48:32.021 --> 48:35.490
And listen, I mean, she had to talk
me down off a couple of ledges myself.

48:35.524 --> 48:39.996
I have learned from her today that
it's important to kind of connect,

48:40.029 --> 48:44.166
since this might be
the last moment you can.

48:44.199 --> 48:46.035
- She's right.
- Makes sense.

48:46.069 --> 48:47.804
It's not
about this dumb shit.

48:47.837 --> 48:52.107
Yeah, it's not about, you know,
who has a better lawn or who's recycling.

48:52.140 --> 48:53.977
Oh, this guy,
he loves his lawn.

48:54.010 --> 48:55.044
What's that
supposed to mean?

48:55.078 --> 48:56.980
You like to,
you love to get that...

48:57.013 --> 48:59.015
Excuse me for just a second. They've created
a nice moment and you're shitting on it.

48:59.048 --> 49:00.182
We're gonna go.

49:00.215 --> 49:01.884
I'll punch you
right in your face.

49:01.918 --> 49:03.218
You're going to kick me
in the dick?

49:03.251 --> 49:04.687
Like you did last year,
on the Fourth of July?

49:04.721 --> 49:06.923
- That was an accident.
- That's a cheap shot.

49:06.956 --> 49:09.391
That was a cheap shot. You
kicked me right in the dick.

49:12.695 --> 49:14.964
Do you think
there's any way he's right?

49:14.998 --> 49:16.298
About recycling? Yeah.

49:16.331 --> 49:18.300
You are supposed to
wash out the containers.

49:18.333 --> 49:20.135
No,
about this being a hoax?

49:20.168 --> 49:21.637
Like, do you think
there's any way...

49:21.670 --> 49:24.139
No. What? I don't know.

49:27.744 --> 49:28.677
- No.
- No.

49:29.712 --> 49:30.847
Are you scared?

49:34.216 --> 49:36.618
Oh, of like, the end?

49:37.252 --> 49:38.788
Yeah, I guess a little.

49:38.821 --> 49:40.990
Helps to have this party
to look forward to.

49:41.024 --> 49:42.624
Yeah, definitely.

49:43.826 --> 49:45.695
And the person at the party.

49:46.863 --> 49:49.699
And the person at the party.

49:49.732 --> 49:51.768
Can I tell you a thing
I'm actually more scared of?

49:54.937 --> 49:55.838
Mom.

50:00.208 --> 50:02.845
Well,
fear is nothing more

50:02.879 --> 50:06.214
than an obstacle that stands
in the way of progress.

50:07.649 --> 50:09.819
Is that our
quote calendar in high school?

50:09.852 --> 50:11.453
Yeah, November.

50:13.022 --> 50:18.527
It's just that
Mom's so intense and stubborn.

50:19.327 --> 50:20.595
That
sounds familiar.

50:24.232 --> 50:25.367
So you'll go?

50:28.004 --> 50:29.204
I guess.

50:29.237 --> 50:30.707
I guess is not yes.

50:35.078 --> 50:38.580
Okay. Yes.

50:39.916 --> 50:40.883
Yes.

50:42.952 --> 50:43.820
You could've called.

50:46.254 --> 50:48.390
Wow, I could have called.
That is so classic.

50:48.423 --> 50:50.827
Yes, sometime over the last few years,
there could have been a phone call.

50:50.860 --> 50:52.995
I'm sorry.
Was your phone unserviceable?

50:53.029 --> 50:54.362
- I tried.
- You tried?

50:54.396 --> 50:56.699
You mean by like,
leaving a voice message,

50:56.733 --> 50:59.068
one time in which there wasn't
even a skeleton of an apology.

50:59.102 --> 51:02.705
More than once. And anyway,
I'm unclear about what I did.

51:02.739 --> 51:04.006
- You're unclear?
- Guys.

51:04.040 --> 51:06.541
Yes, it's like if I sneeze
wrong, you would decide

51:06.575 --> 51:08.677
it was intentionally positioned
to hurt you.

51:08.711 --> 51:10.146
Yeah, here we go.
This is fun.

51:10.179 --> 51:12.014
This is when you start to make
fun of my being sensitive.

51:12.048 --> 51:13.216
Guys.

51:13.248 --> 51:14.249
Like, that's not triggering
for me, at all.

51:14.282 --> 51:16.418
I am also incredibly sensitive.

51:16.451 --> 51:18.154
Okay, yeah. And then
make it about yourself.

51:18.187 --> 51:19.387
And you want
to talk about triggering

51:19.421 --> 51:22.091
you constantly alluding
to my narcissism.

51:22.125 --> 51:26.729
Oh well, only a narcissist would use
her own narcissism to make herself...

51:26.763 --> 51:28.396
That's not even
the definition of narcissism.

51:28.430 --> 51:29.932
This is about me.

51:29.966 --> 51:31.299
Yes, that's more
the definition.

51:31.333 --> 51:32.267
Oh, my God. You are...

51:32.300 --> 51:33.236
People say narcissism...

51:33.268 --> 51:35.938
Hey, shut the fuck up!

51:37.240 --> 51:38.708
Both of you.

51:38.741 --> 51:40.810
I need my mom.

51:40.843 --> 51:45.280
And I am trapped inside this
grown person who has no idea

51:45.313 --> 51:47.016
how to ask for what she needs.

51:47.049 --> 51:49.685
So just please...

51:54.857 --> 51:55.892
Sorry.

51:55.925 --> 51:56.793
I'm sorry.

51:58.761 --> 52:00.529
It's just,

52:00.562 --> 52:03.665
you know, you came back
after all those years,

52:03.699 --> 52:06.936
and I feel like I like,
took the bait.

52:06.969 --> 52:10.338
It wasn't bait. You made it very
clear the damage had been done.

52:10.372 --> 52:12.775
Okay, so then what?
You just completely tap out.

52:12.809 --> 52:14.877
Wouldn't say
I completely tapped out.

52:14.911 --> 52:18.714
You didn't return
her phone calls... twice.

52:18.748 --> 52:20.750
- Three times.
- Three times.

52:23.186 --> 52:24.053
I didn't?

52:33.930 --> 52:34.864
I don't know.

52:39.634 --> 52:43.873
I'm not sure I was meant
to be a mom.

52:46.641 --> 52:50.445
It's a really weird thing
as a woman to face,

52:50.478 --> 52:52.882
especially after
you've already had a kid,

52:55.517 --> 53:01.891
but it's just not in my bones.

53:01.924 --> 53:07.029
I thought if I played the role long enough,
that it would settle in or whatever.

53:08.663 --> 53:12.400
I was in such a bad place when
I found out about your dad's...

53:14.203 --> 53:16.404
all that after a lifetime

53:16.438 --> 53:19.407
of crippling anxiety
and depression.

53:24.613 --> 53:27.149
When I left, it wasn't because
I didn't love you.

53:29.285 --> 53:33.388
I loved you so...
I love you so...

53:38.426 --> 53:40.395
But I still always felt like
I was failing you,

53:40.428 --> 53:43.766
like I could never live up,
like you were better off without me.

53:45.167 --> 53:46.102
- I wasn't.
- I wasn't.

53:53.209 --> 53:56.611
But I get it.

53:56.645 --> 54:01.549
I mean, I feel
all those feelings too.

54:02.885 --> 54:05.487
I mean, not about you,
about me.

54:09.825 --> 54:10.760
I'm sorry.

54:13.461 --> 54:14.764
Accept her apology.

54:15.898 --> 54:18.134
I don't know if that was
like an actual apology.

54:18.167 --> 54:20.635
It was more like, I'm sorry
you're also fucked up.

54:22.437 --> 54:23.672
Was it an apology?

54:28.643 --> 54:29.979
I accept your apology.

54:38.520 --> 54:41.958
Your dad reached out today
to me on Zoom.

54:41.991 --> 54:42.825
Yeah.

54:42.858 --> 54:44.160
I think he was trying
to apologize.

54:45.194 --> 54:46.228
I don't know. He was muted.

54:46.262 --> 54:47.263
Oh, no.

54:51.434 --> 54:52.600
Do you feel better?

54:55.805 --> 54:56.772
I feel sad.

54:58.441 --> 55:00.009
Why? That went so great.

55:01.711 --> 55:06.716
I know, it's just now I wish
I had more time, you know.

55:07.984 --> 55:10.585
Okay. We're not getting down
in the dumps, alright?

55:10.618 --> 55:12.221
Best of the night
is yet to come.

55:13.856 --> 55:15.791
So let's just focus
on the party.

55:16.292 --> 55:17.460
Right.

55:17.492 --> 55:20.930
Party is fun, party is sexy,
party is happy.

55:20.963 --> 55:23.733
Party is fun, party is sexy,
party is...

55:25.768 --> 55:26.769
Oh my god. There he is.

55:26.802 --> 55:29.504
Oh, my God,
he's coming after us!

55:56.465 --> 55:57.466
Okay.

55:57.500 --> 55:58.633
I think we lost him.

55:59.101 --> 56:00.703
That was insane.

56:01.536 --> 56:03.439
People are crazy today.

56:03.472 --> 56:05.207
We got to get to
this party, man.

56:05.241 --> 56:06.574
These streets are not safe.

56:06.608 --> 56:08.310
- Okay.
- Okay.

56:09.945 --> 56:11.680
Let's practice
what you're gonna say to Nate.

56:12.415 --> 56:14.483
Hey, Nate. It's me, Liza.

56:14.517 --> 56:15.918
Why are you saying your name?

56:16.584 --> 56:17.887
It's not a phone call.

56:17.920 --> 56:20.956
Okay. So I start, "Hey, Nate.
What's up, Nate?"

56:21.390 --> 56:22.992
Just be cool.

56:24.093 --> 56:26.162
Like this, "Sup, Nate?"

56:27.129 --> 56:28.064
Sup, Nate.

56:29.398 --> 56:30.332
Sup, Nate.

56:31.566 --> 56:32.835
Try it.

56:32.868 --> 56:33.969
- You serious?
- No, be serious.

56:34.003 --> 56:37.239
Okay. Sup, Nate?

56:37.273 --> 56:38.374
Yeah, that's good.

56:38.407 --> 56:39.508
I like that...
I know.

56:39.542 --> 56:41.310
I did like
that shirt on you.

56:41.343 --> 56:42.945
Oh my God, Celine. Hi.

56:42.978 --> 56:44.579
Hey.

56:44.612 --> 56:48.451
Oh, listen man, I'm sorry I didn't text
you back earlier about the outfit thing.

56:48.484 --> 56:51.353
Don't even worry about it. I can't
even remember what I was talking about.

56:51.387 --> 56:52.620
That feels like
it was years ago.

56:52.654 --> 56:55.691
Is that what you landed on?
For the party?

56:55.724 --> 56:58.593
Oh, you did not hear. Yeah.

56:59.395 --> 57:00.463
Hear what?

57:00.496 --> 57:03.199
So I guess Mandy did
too much ketamine,

57:03.232 --> 57:06.668
which like, what's the desired
amount of ketamine, whatever that is,

57:06.702 --> 57:08.204
she did, like,
eight times that.

57:08.237 --> 57:09.238
They found her in a cave.

57:09.271 --> 57:11.974
Some hikers found her,
just like all by herself.

57:12.007 --> 57:15.878
Um, she did have a purse
and in her purse,

57:15.911 --> 57:17.713
there were just
two dead rabbits.

57:17.746 --> 57:19.748
She had written out this,
you know,

57:19.782 --> 57:23.085
manifesto, there was like, red string
everywhere, trying to find their killer.

57:23.119 --> 57:25.087
So they airlifted her
out of there.

57:25.121 --> 57:27.723
She actually had, like, pretty good
sources too. She had cited it all.

57:27.756 --> 57:28.691
Not just from,
like the Internet.

57:28.724 --> 57:29.758
Like she had looked at books.

57:29.792 --> 57:31.527
And like gone to a library
and stuff.

57:31.560 --> 57:34.230
I personally, I'm kind of like,
I'm on board, like because we're learning

57:34.263 --> 57:36.966
all sorts of stuff right now,
like they're declassifying crazy shit like,

57:36.999 --> 57:40.069
did you know that the CIA
wrote all of Bob Dylan songs?

57:40.102 --> 57:43.472
Every one. Every lyric,
every note, the CIA wrote it.

57:43.506 --> 57:45.441
So the party?

57:45.474 --> 57:46.475
Oh sorry, bleh.

57:46.509 --> 57:47.675
Long way to say, party's off.

57:47.710 --> 57:48.676
Yeah, no party.

57:48.711 --> 57:49.677
It's not happening.

57:49.712 --> 57:51.714
No, how could it?

57:53.716 --> 57:55.351
Oh, you guys are bummed.

57:55.384 --> 57:57.119
I'm sorry. Um...

57:57.153 --> 58:01.056
It's okay, Celine.

58:01.090 --> 58:04.393
I need to kind of stay like,
a little bit more up for today,

58:04.426 --> 58:06.162
like, I kind of want to end
things on like, a high note

58:06.195 --> 58:07.596
and you guys are kind of
bumming me out.

58:07.630 --> 58:08.663
But I do really like you

58:08.697 --> 58:09.865
and I'm sorry,
but I have to bounce.

58:09.899 --> 58:11.834
But I love you. You look great.

58:11.867 --> 58:13.435
- Bye.
- Bye, guys.

58:20.643 --> 58:21.810
Hey.

58:23.946 --> 58:26.949
Hey.

58:30.486 --> 58:31.420
Hey, Liza.

58:32.321 --> 58:33.923
Liza, look at me.

58:33.956 --> 58:39.161
Of course.
This is how this...

58:40.362 --> 58:41.363
Okay.

58:41.397 --> 58:44.266
You are just so fucking naive.

58:45.201 --> 58:46.068
Hey.

58:46.101 --> 58:49.471
To think that like today
could be just not

58:49.505 --> 58:53.342
like a series of
soul crushing...

58:54.276 --> 58:55.277
What it is.

58:55.311 --> 58:59.281
Like that I could somehow
suddenly just be free.

59:00.382 --> 59:01.517
You are free.

59:01.550 --> 59:02.952
I am not free.

59:03.919 --> 59:05.421
I will never be free.

59:05.988 --> 59:07.022
You said it yourself.

59:07.056 --> 59:10.059
I am fucking trapped, man.

59:10.092 --> 59:13.362
And every time I think I can,
like, step outside of it.

59:13.395 --> 59:16.432
Okay, you're made a choice
to go down this path.

59:16.465 --> 59:19.301
No. I made a choice today

59:19.335 --> 59:21.136
to not set myself up

59:22.371 --> 59:23.806
to be disappointed.

59:23.839 --> 59:29.211
I make that choice every day and
you just can't fucking let me do it.

59:29.245 --> 59:31.880
Because it's a fucking
horrible way to live.

59:31.914 --> 59:34.650
Oh my God, what do you know?

59:34.684 --> 59:37.721
To dull life so you never
get disappointed?

59:37.753 --> 59:40.189
Who cares
that the party's canceled?

59:40.222 --> 59:41.423
I do.

59:41.457 --> 59:42.791
Well, you should grow up.

59:42.825 --> 59:44.226
You should grow up.

59:44.260 --> 59:47.229
That's what I've been
trying to do.

59:47.263 --> 59:48.530
Don't you get it?

59:48.564 --> 59:50.032
The rules are really
fucking simple.

59:50.065 --> 59:52.768
I can't grow up
unless I have my own feelings.

59:52.801 --> 59:55.471
But your feelings
are so fucking overpowering

59:55.504 --> 59:58.340
that I can't have
any of my own.

59:58.374 --> 01:00:01.310
Don't you think I'm upset
that the party's canceled?

01:00:01.343 --> 01:00:05.014
I don't know. It's like you're always
just fucking bright siding everything.

01:00:05.047 --> 01:00:10.152
I need tonight.
I need it worse than you do.

01:00:10.185 --> 01:00:11.787
How is that?

01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:14.990
You don't remember?
When this all started,

01:00:15.858 --> 01:00:16.992
when you were me,

01:00:18.193 --> 01:00:21.864
and life started feeling
like it wasn't worth living.

01:00:22.898 --> 01:00:26.135
And every day since,
you can't shake it.

01:00:26.835 --> 01:00:28.437
You want to talk freedom.

01:00:28.470 --> 01:00:33.242
I'm your prisoner and I've been your
prisoner this whole fucking time.

01:00:34.843 --> 01:00:38.080
And I thought tonight
that I could,

01:00:39.248 --> 01:00:40.416
that we could...

01:00:44.653 --> 01:00:46.188
We can still find Nate.

01:00:47.156 --> 01:00:49.358
And we can still
make something happen.

01:00:49.391 --> 01:00:50.326
No.

01:00:51.728 --> 01:00:53.429
Liza, please.

01:00:55.164 --> 01:00:56.332
Please.

01:00:58.434 --> 01:00:59.535
I am alone.

01:01:01.904 --> 01:01:04.006
The universe
just keeps telling me

01:01:06.141 --> 01:01:08.844
I am meant to be alone.

01:01:08.877 --> 01:01:11.013
But you're not alone.
You have me.

01:01:11.046 --> 01:01:11.947
But you don't count.

01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:15.484
Why do you keep saying that?

01:01:16.885 --> 01:01:18.520
I do count.

01:01:18.554 --> 01:01:21.423
I do count, okay?

01:01:21.457 --> 01:01:26.328
All your life, you've been
licking your fucking wounds.

01:01:26.362 --> 01:01:30.165
You haven't realized that
I'm the biggest wound of all.

01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:38.107
I can't do this.

01:01:42.344 --> 01:01:43.245
Liza.

01:01:47.416 --> 01:01:48.384
Liza.

01:03:39.361 --> 01:03:40.462
Hey, you! Hey!

01:03:41.096 --> 01:03:42.699
- That's my bike.
- Shit!

01:03:42.732 --> 01:03:43.733
The fuck are you doing?

01:03:43.766 --> 01:03:45.167
I'm sorry.

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:46.903
Why you gotta go
and steal my bike?

01:03:46.936 --> 01:03:50.272
I'm so sorry. I didn't realize that it
belonged to anyone. There was a sign.

01:03:50.305 --> 01:03:52.508
Yes, I left it on the side
of the road with a sign

01:03:52.541 --> 01:03:55.143
because I did a scavenger hunt
for my girlfriend.

01:03:55.845 --> 01:03:57.346
Oh, fuck.

01:03:57.379 --> 01:03:59.782
It was supposed to lead her
to the place that we first met.

01:03:59.816 --> 01:04:03.285
Is it too late? What? Where?
Could you still go? Like, where was it?

01:04:03.853 --> 01:04:05.053
Cheetah's.

01:04:05.855 --> 01:04:07.155
The strip club?

01:04:07.690 --> 01:04:09.191
Yes, the strip club.

01:04:09.224 --> 01:04:10.860
Is she like a dancer?

01:04:10.894 --> 01:04:12.327
No, she's not a dancer.

01:04:12.361 --> 01:04:14.029
She's an interior designer.

01:04:14.530 --> 01:04:15.631
Ah.

01:04:15.664 --> 01:04:16.665
Of strip clubs.

01:04:17.399 --> 01:04:18.133
Really?

01:04:18.166 --> 01:04:19.234
Yes, really.

01:04:19.268 --> 01:04:20.703
Wow, I didn't realize
that was like a...

01:04:21.771 --> 01:04:22.839
Yeah, she's really well known.

01:04:22.872 --> 01:04:24.506
Oh.

01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:26.642
I'm super fucking proud of her.
She's really made a name for herself.

01:04:26.675 --> 01:04:28.143
Sorry.

01:04:28.176 --> 01:04:30.780
Really romantic evening planned
too, but I'm not gonna have it now.

01:04:31.881 --> 01:04:33.515
Because I have no idea
where she is.

01:04:34.984 --> 01:04:36.184
I...

01:04:36.218 --> 01:04:37.720
I lost someone, too.

01:04:38.855 --> 01:04:40.790
So I feel your pain.

01:04:41.657 --> 01:04:42.792
Yeah.

01:04:42.825 --> 01:04:43.726
Yeah.

01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:45.594
Who'd you lose?

01:04:45.627 --> 01:04:51.600
My, uh, myself, I guess.

01:04:51.633 --> 01:04:58.307
Oh, wow. It's like an existential
scavenger hunt for your soul.

01:04:59.474 --> 01:05:00.676
Yeah, I guess.

01:05:00.710 --> 01:05:02.077
Oh, I dig that.

01:05:02.110 --> 01:05:04.446
Listen, I'm really sorry,
again, and, uh...

01:05:04.479 --> 01:05:06.515
You know, It's all yours.
I mean, it's literally yours.

01:05:06.548 --> 01:05:10.319
But, it's, now, also,
uh, physically yours and, um...

01:05:10.352 --> 01:05:11.921
Hey, keep looking for her, man.

01:05:11.955 --> 01:05:15.557
Yeah, I will and, and...
keep, you know, looking for yourself, too.

01:05:15.591 --> 01:05:17.026
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

01:05:20.997 --> 01:05:22.598
Oh, shit,
she just dropped the pin.

01:05:46.321 --> 01:05:47.924
I think, you know,
I'm not there.

01:05:47.957 --> 01:05:49.058
I can get there.

01:05:50.927 --> 01:05:53.062
Get out of me.

01:05:53.096 --> 01:05:54.529
You're laughing.

01:05:56.799 --> 01:05:58.001
Ah, hello.

01:05:58.034 --> 01:05:59.601
- Oh, hi, hi.
- Hi.

01:05:59.635 --> 01:06:01.070
Hi, so sorry, I, uh...

01:06:01.104 --> 01:06:03.205
- I thought I heard crying and it sounded like, uh,...
- Yeah, you did.

01:06:03.238 --> 01:06:06.843
I'm looking for someone else and it
sounded... sounded like her for a moment.

01:06:06.876 --> 01:06:08.477
- Oh.
- Sorry.

01:06:08.510 --> 01:06:11.146
- Yeah, don't go, stay.
- No, it's okay...

01:06:11.179 --> 01:06:12.447
- No, it's...
- Come on in.

01:06:12.481 --> 01:06:14.216
We're actually, you know,
we're doing, right now, is

01:06:14.249 --> 01:06:16.518
we're opening up our heart
shakers and it's like a...

01:06:16.551 --> 01:06:19.221
- Chakras. Chakras.
- Our heart chakras.

01:06:19.254 --> 01:06:21.057
I didn't not want to do it,

01:06:21.090 --> 01:06:22.624
- but...
- You do, though, now.

01:06:22.658 --> 01:06:25.627
- Yeah, now, I'm enjoying it, I don't wanna do it, but...
- Yeah.

01:06:25.661 --> 01:06:27.663
It's actually really,
kind of, a healing, opening...

01:06:27.697 --> 01:06:29.164
It's kind of good
to do it right now.

01:06:29.197 --> 01:06:31.734
Yes, it so nice
to just like open up

01:06:31.768 --> 01:06:32.835
with our feelings and...

01:06:32.869 --> 01:06:34.536
We do affirmations

01:06:34.569 --> 01:06:38.074
were we sort of shout things that
we like about each other. Fake.

01:06:38.107 --> 01:06:39.742
Aww.

01:06:39.776 --> 01:06:42.210
Right, it's nice for them and it
feels good just let it flow out of ya.

01:06:42.244 --> 01:06:43.478
- Oral sex.
- Ah, hmph.

01:06:44.212 --> 01:06:45.313
Thank you.

01:06:45.347 --> 01:06:46.983
- Well, thank you.
- Yeah.

01:06:47.016 --> 01:06:48.417
Well, that, that's beautiful.

01:06:48.450 --> 01:06:52.587
Um, really, and I support you
in what you're doing today,

01:06:52.621 --> 01:06:54.090
but I think
I should, probably...

01:06:54.123 --> 01:06:56.291
- Oh, we could do you.
- I mean, yeah, that might feel good.

01:06:56.324 --> 01:06:58.293
Eyeballs. You got nice eyes.

01:06:58.326 --> 01:07:03.032
Yeah, and your skin
is tight and glistening.

01:07:03.066 --> 01:07:05.735
You got a healthy regimen goin
there, for sure, absolutely.

01:07:05.768 --> 01:07:08.570
- The bondage straps are cool.
- Oh, yes.

01:07:08.603 --> 01:07:12.075
- That's a groovy thing there. Good choice.
- Are you done with those?

01:07:12.108 --> 01:07:13.843
Oh, this is just a backpack.

01:07:14.110 --> 01:07:15.410
Oh.

01:07:15.444 --> 01:07:17.146
You could, probably,
still use it.

01:07:17.180 --> 01:07:18.613
I think so.

01:07:18.647 --> 01:07:21.117
- Chop it up and use that way if you wanted, you know.
- Yeah.

01:07:21.150 --> 01:07:23.186
Just hog tie kind of a thing.

01:07:23.218 --> 01:07:24.721
You wanted to
get funky with it.

01:07:24.754 --> 01:07:28.891
Um, anyway, that actually
did feel really nice,

01:07:28.925 --> 01:07:33.796
thank you, but, I think,
I have to get back to looking for her.

01:07:33.830 --> 01:07:35.832
Yeah, actually, you know what,
if you're looking for something

01:07:35.865 --> 01:07:38.167
can I just tell you
a real quick story?

01:07:38.201 --> 01:07:39.869
I lost a pair for shoes once,

01:07:39.902 --> 01:07:42.604
I looked around everywhere
for these shoes.

01:07:42.637 --> 01:07:45.340
I was really broken up
about it because...

01:07:45.373 --> 01:07:48.610
I love these shoes and they
were like a part of me.

01:07:48.643 --> 01:07:50.479
I actually cried.
You know it's like, uh...

01:07:50.512 --> 01:07:52.581
a piece of me was missing.

01:07:52.614 --> 01:07:56.219
I looked everywhere for them,
I couldn't find them and, then,

01:07:56.251 --> 01:07:58.487
ultimately, I did find them

01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:00.388
in the strangest of places...

01:08:00.422 --> 01:08:02.591
They were on my bed.

01:08:02.624 --> 01:08:04.359
Because they were on my feet.

01:08:04.392 --> 01:08:06.028
I was lying in bed
wearing my shoes.

01:08:06.628 --> 01:08:07.730
And...

01:08:09.832 --> 01:08:11.768
It made me realize, okay,

01:08:11.801 --> 01:08:16.773
why can't find shoes to just like an
outdoor thing, they could be indoors.

01:08:16.805 --> 01:08:20.509
They could be in bed
where shoes feel most free.

01:08:20.542 --> 01:08:22.712
You know, most comfortable.

01:08:22.745 --> 01:08:26.182
That's a lot,
that's the story about shoes.

01:08:26.215 --> 01:08:28.117
You said that
they feel most free.

01:08:28.151 --> 01:08:29.651
Mmm.

01:08:29.685 --> 01:08:32.354
Yes, Oh, my God.
I think I just...

01:08:32.386 --> 01:08:35.290
I think I might have just
figured out where she is.

01:08:35.323 --> 01:08:36.424
- Oh, yeah?
- Because of us?

01:08:36.457 --> 01:08:38.593
- Yeah.
- That's amazing.

01:08:38.627 --> 01:08:40.229
- Thank you so much.
- Okay.

01:08:40.263 --> 01:08:41.395
- Thank you.
- Okay.

01:08:41.429 --> 01:08:42.832
- God speed.
- Oh, man.

01:08:44.499 --> 01:08:47.804
- I am tripping balls right now.
- Yeah.

01:08:47.837 --> 01:08:49.738
- Yeah.
- Like...

01:08:49.772 --> 01:08:51.305
Like super high.

01:08:54.176 --> 01:08:56.444
Hey, was someone just here?

01:08:57.444 --> 01:08:59.413
I don't think so.

01:08:59.982 --> 01:09:01.448
Okay.

01:09:42.158 --> 01:09:43.926
I love the way

01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:45.594
you look at me.

01:09:49.564 --> 01:09:51.901
How your eyes get,
like, so big.

01:09:54.002 --> 01:09:58.406
And your lip kind of curls, when you
think I'm about say something funny.

01:10:02.677 --> 01:10:05.380
How you laugh
with your whole body.

01:10:06.249 --> 01:10:09.517
How no one has taken that
from you yet.

01:10:09.551 --> 01:10:12.154
Made you feel embarrassed or...

01:10:13.789 --> 01:10:15.557
Like it's uncool.

01:10:19.161 --> 01:10:21.230
I love how weird
your walk is.

01:10:21.264 --> 01:10:22.597
Man, like...

01:10:22.631 --> 01:10:25.600
How big the steps
you take are.

01:10:25.634 --> 01:10:28.704
Like you have no uncertainty
that you'll get there.

01:10:30.873 --> 01:10:34.609
How you just keep
showing up everyday.

01:10:34.643 --> 01:10:38.114
To tell me to keep going even
when I don't know how to.

01:10:44.186 --> 01:10:47.290
I have never been loved
by anyone

01:10:47.323 --> 01:10:49.125
the way you have loved me.

01:10:51.426 --> 01:10:53.628
And I am so sorry

01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:58.167
that I haven't known
how to love you back.

01:11:03.672 --> 01:11:05.440
When I say you don't count,

01:11:05.473 --> 01:11:08.144
I'm not talking to you,
I'm talking to me.

01:11:10.246 --> 01:11:12.315
I always forget that...

01:11:12.348 --> 01:11:13.983
...it's the same thing.

01:11:15.952 --> 01:11:17.153
You do count.

01:11:19.322 --> 01:11:21.556
You count more than anyone.

01:11:23.025 --> 01:11:24.760
You count more than me.

01:11:28.998 --> 01:11:30.565
No, I don't.

01:11:31.867 --> 01:11:33.035
You do.

01:11:34.636 --> 01:11:36.872
I need you
to know that you do.

01:11:36.906 --> 01:11:39.976
You made it count,
you have to count too.

01:11:47.850 --> 01:11:49.484
Okay?

01:11:54.156 --> 01:11:55.691
Okay.

01:12:08.738 --> 01:12:10.873
You think I walk weird?

01:12:12.041 --> 01:12:13.876
That's your take away?

01:12:14.710 --> 01:12:16.846
It was fucking weird.

01:12:20.548 --> 01:12:22.517
I love you, Liza.

01:12:23.651 --> 01:12:25.721
I love you, Liza.

01:12:34.330 --> 01:12:35.865
Hey, how did you
get here, anyway?

01:12:40.336 --> 01:12:41.804
This is John.

01:12:41.837 --> 01:12:44.539
Hi, I'm John,
I stole your car.

01:12:44.572 --> 01:12:48.077
It feels really good to get that
out, I gotta say.

01:12:48.110 --> 01:12:51.546
I just, uh...

01:12:51.579 --> 01:12:55.017
I didn't want the last thing on
Earth to be like a negative thing.

01:12:55.051 --> 01:12:58.087
I wanted... I wanted it to be a
positive thing, you know, for me, so...

01:12:58.120 --> 01:12:59.855
I don't know
if you have noticed this,

01:12:59.889 --> 01:13:02.024
but, I've been trying all day,
I've been following you.

01:13:02.058 --> 01:13:03.125
You know, we did notice.

01:13:03.459 --> 01:13:05.194
Yeah.

01:13:05.227 --> 01:13:10.032
Yeah, I'm not really like a outdoors
person, I'm more of an indoors person.

01:13:10.066 --> 01:13:12.468
I spent my...
all my time indoors,

01:13:12.501 --> 01:13:14.470
you know, except when
I'm like stealing stuff.

01:13:14.503 --> 01:13:16.472
Which is like everyday.

01:13:16.505 --> 01:13:18.074
- Really?
- Cool.

01:13:18.107 --> 01:13:20.309
I didn't always wanna lead
a life of crime.

01:13:20.342 --> 01:13:22.411
I've actually got a pretty
interesting back story.

01:13:22.445 --> 01:13:24.213
It's a very interesting story.

01:13:24.246 --> 01:13:26.015
I just wanted to do musicals.

01:13:26.048 --> 01:13:27.850
I could do it,
you know what I mean.

01:13:27.883 --> 01:13:30.719
'Cause I can sing, you
know, like, I can sing.

01:13:30.753 --> 01:13:36.459
<i>♪ Judas, I love you, Judas ♪</i>

01:13:36.492 --> 01:13:39.728
<i>♪ How could you betray me ♪</i>

01:13:39.762 --> 01:13:41.864
You know,
I should have done musicals.

01:13:41.897 --> 01:13:42.965
Um...

01:13:43.766 --> 01:13:46.302
Are you going to Mandy's party?

01:13:46.335 --> 01:13:48.804
- What, you're going?
- I thought that wasn't happening.

01:13:48.838 --> 01:13:53.109
No, I have it on good authority that it's
very much now, happening again, so...

01:13:53.142 --> 01:13:54.243
I'd give you a ride.

01:13:54.676 --> 01:13:56.212
It's my car, man.

01:13:56.245 --> 01:13:59.148
Yes, this is your car. Can I
actually get a ride back to my house?

01:13:59.181 --> 01:14:01.150
I got a house
full of wild animals.

01:14:01.183 --> 01:14:04.353
It's a long story,
that's a whole story in another self,

01:14:04.386 --> 01:14:07.156
but, they are not domesticated.

01:14:07.189 --> 01:14:09.492
I mean, do you want to drive
or you want me to drive?

01:14:09.525 --> 01:14:12.995
Actually, you drive.
I've had a long day.

01:14:13.462 --> 01:14:15.064
Oh, my God.

01:14:15.097 --> 01:14:18.868
Am I making sense,
because here's the deal.

01:14:18.901 --> 01:14:22.371
Solids are solid, hard isn't
hard unless you allow it be hard.

01:14:22.404 --> 01:14:24.273
If you enter negotiation

01:14:24.306 --> 01:14:26.242
that's when I realized

01:14:26.275 --> 01:14:30.546
that I could chew through metal
because I didn't allow the metal

01:14:30.579 --> 01:14:31.747
to have power over me.

01:14:31.780 --> 01:14:33.549
Do you know what I'm saying?

01:14:33.582 --> 01:14:35.985
Okay, so,
it's like a lot, I know.

01:14:36.018 --> 01:14:37.820
Okay, it's a lot. It's a lot to
handle, it's a lot to process.

01:14:37.853 --> 01:14:39.588
Just think about it.

01:14:39.622 --> 01:14:42.224

- Wow.

01:14:42.258 --> 01:14:43.392

He had some Ketamine too.

01:15:09.718 --> 01:15:11.420
We guys smoked and snorted it.

01:15:11.453 --> 01:15:15.291
The thing is, your friends are not
cool, they're really bumming me out.

01:15:15.324 --> 01:15:16.759
I mean, for real.

01:15:16.792 --> 01:15:18.561
These people,
is fucking bumming me out, dude,

01:15:18.594 --> 01:15:22.865
I mean, the facts are it's a
wrap, and I'm celebrating tonight

01:15:22.898 --> 01:15:25.134
because I should've been dead
a long time ago.

01:15:25.167 --> 01:15:28.270
- Dude. Oh, that I'd...
- I mean, for real. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:15:28.304 --> 01:15:29.471
You know what I'm saying?

01:15:29.505 --> 01:15:31.707
Yeah, I've read...
I've read a lot of things about you.

01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:33.209
- You know where we met?
- Where?

01:15:33.242 --> 01:15:35.477
- TikTok, don't stop.
- TikTok, TikTok, TikTok...

01:15:35.511 --> 01:15:37.079
You met on TikTok.

01:15:37.112 --> 01:15:40.583
Wow, that's like
a whole new meet cue.

01:15:41.784 --> 01:15:44.186
We have decided,
as a team,

01:15:44.220 --> 01:15:47.957
that we are going
to get pregnant tonight

01:15:47.990 --> 01:15:51.227
because we can take the zygote

01:15:51.260 --> 01:15:52.595
through the portal

01:15:52.628 --> 01:15:53.996
that we're about
to all cross through...

01:15:54.029 --> 01:15:55.764
Stop saying you're gonna die.

01:15:55.798 --> 01:15:57.633
After I put it in
her port hole.

01:15:57.666 --> 01:15:58.801
- ...the front one.
- Yeah.

01:15:59.703 --> 01:16:01.870
We do need to copulate.

01:16:01.904 --> 01:16:03.205
So, we'll go and we'll be back.

01:16:03.239 --> 01:16:04.840
- Make yourself at home. Have fun.
- Alright.

01:16:04.873 --> 01:16:06.375
Do you want this?

01:16:06.408 --> 01:16:07.876
- I'm good.
- Okay, let's go.

01:16:08.744 --> 01:16:10.779
Okay, bye-bye.

01:16:18.454 --> 01:16:19.855
Ah, okay.

01:16:24.159 --> 01:16:25.494
Hi.

01:16:25.527 --> 01:16:26.595
Hi.

01:16:26.629 --> 01:16:28.430
- You came.
- Oh, I did, yeah.

01:16:32.568 --> 01:16:34.203
Nate, I am...

01:16:37.339 --> 01:16:40.976
Listen, I've been meaning to tell
you something for a long time.

01:16:44.246 --> 01:16:45.347
Okay.

01:16:48.417 --> 01:16:50.085
You have my...

01:16:50.119 --> 01:16:51.620
favorite sweatshirt
still or what?

01:16:51.654 --> 01:16:53.122
No.

01:16:53.155 --> 01:16:57.092
I mean, I actually do have
your sweatshirt still.

01:16:57.126 --> 01:16:59.061
I would say I'd get it
back to you, but...

01:16:59.094 --> 01:17:00.362
Yeah.

01:17:01.230 --> 01:17:02.831
Nate, I...

01:17:06.669 --> 01:17:08.237
I love you.

01:17:10.774 --> 01:17:12.574
I've always loved you.

01:17:13.509 --> 01:17:15.044
And I...

01:17:16.645 --> 01:17:19.716
I guess,
I'm just not great at...

01:17:19.749 --> 01:17:22.251
Well, um...

01:17:23.185 --> 01:17:24.386
Nobody is.

01:17:25.087 --> 01:17:26.255
You are.

01:17:27.724 --> 01:17:29.091
You were

01:17:29.124 --> 01:17:33.629
and I wasn't able to receive it

01:17:33.662 --> 01:17:37.566
and I'm, really,
I'm so sorry...

01:17:37.599 --> 01:17:39.101
Nah.

01:17:39.134 --> 01:17:43.238
...that I hurt you. I...
you know, it's not. It's really not...

01:17:43.272 --> 01:17:46.608
I mean, it sucked,
it hurt, but...

01:17:48.778 --> 01:17:51.748
It means a lot to...

01:17:51.781 --> 01:17:53.849
To hear that
from you right now.

01:17:55.417 --> 01:17:56.919
'Cause I love you.

01:17:59.221 --> 01:18:01.123
And I never stop loving you.

01:18:04.761 --> 01:18:07.396
Damn, me too.

01:18:08.597 --> 01:18:09.865
Really?

01:18:10.866 --> 01:18:12.201
Really.

01:18:14.636 --> 01:18:15.571
Damn.

01:18:16.706 --> 01:18:18.407
What could've been.

01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:19.809
Yeah, if only.

01:18:19.843 --> 01:18:21.410
Yeah, I fucked it up.

01:18:21.443 --> 01:18:24.380
Yeah, I know, man.
I'm a fucking idiot.

01:18:24.413 --> 01:18:25.314
You are.

01:18:33.723 --> 01:18:35.057
I've an idea.

01:18:35.457 --> 01:18:36.558
Okay.

01:18:39.027 --> 01:18:41.798
What if we don't ruin it?

01:18:41.831 --> 01:18:44.900
You mean,
just like leave it at that?

01:18:45.267 --> 01:18:46.368
Yeah.

01:18:47.771 --> 01:18:49.571
Pick it up in the next one.

01:18:49.605 --> 01:18:51.340
God, I hope so.

01:18:53.909 --> 01:18:55.177
Yeah.

01:18:59.783 --> 01:19:01.684
Hey, you wanna go inside or...

01:19:02.651 --> 01:19:04.086
Um...

01:19:09.057 --> 01:19:11.360
No, I think I'm gonna go home.

01:19:12.661 --> 01:19:15.597
You're gonna be okay
by yourself tonight, Liza?

01:19:17.466 --> 01:19:19.034
I won't be.

01:19:50.532 --> 01:19:52.000
Ready?

01:19:54.670 --> 01:19:56.171
Yeah.

01:19:57.941 --> 01:19:59.174
You?

01:20:01.911 --> 01:20:03.278
Yeah.
