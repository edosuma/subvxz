You ready?

00:03.904 --> 00:04.903
- Thank you.

00:05.006 --> 00:05.904
All right.
One.

00:06.007 --> 00:07.039
- Do that.

00:07.108 --> 00:08.040
- Two.

00:08.109 --> 00:09.842
Now do a little dance.

00:09.910 --> 00:11.677
I'm a bottle girl.

00:11.746 --> 00:13.445
Pray for us, bitches.

00:13.514 --> 00:14.847
It's gonna be crazy.

00:17.385 --> 00:18.283
- Oh yeah!

00:18.352 --> 00:19.618
Reunion!

00:19.687 --> 00:21.253
Yeah!

00:21.322 --> 00:23.055
<i> - Tonight, the</i>
<i> "Jersey Shore" family</i>

00:23.124 --> 00:26.692

your life becomes a circus.

00:30.398 --> 00:31.697
- Here we go.

00:31.766 --> 00:33.966
<i> - The vacation was</i>
<i> just like old times,</i>

00:34.035 --> 00:36.101
<i> but who invited Old Sitch?</i>

00:36.170 --> 00:37.503
- Is it true or not?

00:37.571 --> 00:39.938
- People came out on the
streets to try to expose you.

00:40.007 --> 00:44.109
<i> - Is Vinny still single, or</i>
<i> is Vinjelina about to become</i>

00:44.178 --> 00:45.210
<i> a wedding hashtag?</i>

00:45.279 --> 00:47.012
There is something we've
enng to ll you guys.

00:47.081 --> 00:48.013
[together]
Oh!

00:48.082 --> 00:49.882
- I knew that was coming.

00:49.950 --> 00:51.417
<i> - It's a night</i>
<i> filled with tacos...</i>

00:51.485 --> 00:53.385
- I knew you brought
the taco truck.

00:53.454 --> 00:54.653
<i> - Raunchy sex talk...</i>

00:54.722 --> 00:55.854
- Men always love
Jenni's titties.

00:55.923 --> 00:56.855
- Yes.

00:56.924 --> 00:57.890
- My God.

00:57.958 --> 01:00.059
<i> - And even a surprise guest.</i>

01:00.127 --> 01:01.293
- I don't know if that's Lola.

01:01.362 --> 01:02.628
[together]
Oh!

01:02.696 --> 01:04.897
<i> - Plus the meatballs</i>
<i> run wild backstage.</i>

01:04.965 --> 01:05.898
- Pour that [bleep].

01:05.966 --> 01:07.433
You guys are doing great.

01:07.501 --> 01:09.868
<i> - And the heat of San Diego</i>
<i> made its way to reunion.</i>

01:09.937 --> 01:11.103
- It's funny.

01:11.172 --> 01:12.838
Everyone here is allowed
to get intoxicated--

01:12.907 --> 01:14.773
Nicole, Deena,
but no one gives a [bleep].

01:14.842 --> 01:16.008
- I'm not throwing
wine on people.

01:16.077 --> 01:17.409
- But I didn't
know it was wine.

01:17.478 --> 01:18.811
- And I always apologize.
- Honestly, I was like OK.

01:18.879 --> 01:20.646
- Do not pull me
into this, bitch.

01:20.714 --> 01:22.481
- To work with
someone that is toxic,

01:22.550 --> 01:24.850
you just can't play anymore.

01:24.919 --> 01:26.518
- Are you leaving?

01:26.587 --> 01:28.220
- What the [bleep]?
- Ooh.

01:28.289 --> 01:32.424

01:41.001 --> 01:42.668
The wait is over.

01:42.736 --> 01:46.438
It's been 10 years,
10 kids, and 5 weddings

01:46.507 --> 01:49.441
since everyone's favorite
roommates hit the reunion

01:49.510 --> 01:51.810
stage, and tonight,
they're back to break

01:51.879 --> 01:54.046
■

01:54.115 --> 01:56.348
I'm your host,
JustVain

01:56.417 --> 02:00.519
Welcome to the "Jersey Shore
Family Vacation Reunion."

02:00.588 --> 02:03.789
Please welcome everyone's
favorite Italian

02:03.858 --> 02:05.757
family, Nicole...

02:05.826 --> 02:07.693
- Are you going to clap for me?
- Yeah, let's clap for her.

02:07.761 --> 02:08.694
Clap it out!

02:08.762 --> 02:11.263
[together] Yay!

02:11.332 --> 02:12.097

02:12.166 --> 02:14.466
- Woo!

02:14.535 --> 02:15.467
- Deena...

02:15.536 --> 02:16.835
- Deena!
- Pauly.

02:16.937 --> 02:17.836
- Yay.
- Pauly...

02:17.938 --> 02:19.571
Yeah. How you guys doing, huh?

02:19.640 --> 02:20.572
- Mike...

02:20.641 --> 02:21.573
- Hey!

02:21.642 --> 02:22.774
- Hey!

02:22.843 --> 02:24.176
- Vinny...

02:24.245 --> 02:26.378
[all shouting]

02:26.447 --> 02:28.180
- And Angelina.

02:28.249 --> 02:29.948
[cheers and applause]

02:30.017 --> 02:32.417
- So what's it like to be
back on the reunion stage?

02:32.486 --> 02:33.585
It's definitely been a minute.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.053
- We've had a lot of reunions.

02:35.122 --> 02:36.054
- A lot of reunions.

02:36.123 --> 02:37.456
- Not in a long time though.

02:37.525 --> 02:41.426
- Season six of "Jersey
Shore" was our last reunion.

02:41.495 --> 02:42.761
- I still got the same haircut.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.196
- Yeah.

02:44.265 --> 02:45.564
- Well, you have been
through a lot, and, you know,

02:45.633 --> 02:48.167
fans have been waiting
years to see this crew back

02:48.235 --> 02:49.434
on a reunion stage.

02:49.503 --> 02:52.404
So naturally, they have
a lot of questions.

02:52.473 --> 02:55.741
- Erica asks Jenni,
we are so excited for you

02:55.809 --> 02:57.176
and Zack's big day.

02:57.244 --> 02:58.243
Congratulations, by the way.

02:58.312 --> 02:59.244
- Whoo!

02:59.313 --> 03:00.579
[cheers and applause]
- Yes.

03:00.648 --> 03:02.214
They want to know, have
you set a date yet?

03:02.283 --> 03:03.448
- We have not.
Still figuring it out.

03:03.517 --> 03:04.483
- OK.

03:04.552 --> 03:05.617
- COVID has a lot to do with.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.119
- Yeah, and you
have famous friends.

03:07.188 --> 03:08.787
It's a lot that goes into
picking a date for something

03:08.856 --> 03:09.888
like that.
- Yeah. For sure.

03:09.990 --> 03:11.323
And I need everyone there.
- Period.

03:11.392 --> 03:12.457
Period.

03:12.526 --> 03:13.692
- They are couples'
goals though.

03:13.761 --> 03:14.960
- They are.
- And we are so proud of them.

03:15.029 --> 03:16.161
- So cute.

03:16.230 --> 03:17.162
- So sweet, and you guys
look great together.

03:17.231 --> 03:18.197
- Aw.
Thank you so much.

03:18.265 --> 03:19.731
- Amazing.

03:19.800 --> 03:22.834
Now, Karen wants to know what
would be your choice of career

03:22.903 --> 03:25.404
if the show never existed,
and she says

03:25.472 --> 03:27.439
she loves you guys, all right?
Hearts.

03:27.508 --> 03:29.708
Now, Vinny, we're going
to start with you.

03:29.777 --> 03:31.510
- I actually was about
to go to law school

03:31.579 --> 03:33.879
before the show started.

03:33.981 --> 03:36.481
- Judge Vinny G?

03:36.550 --> 03:37.716
- What about the
rest of you guys?

03:37.785 --> 03:39.117
- I don't know, a winery?

03:39.186 --> 03:41.420
- Oh, that'd be dope.
- You would be a winery?

03:41.488 --> 03:42.588
- You'd like to be the host
of one?

03:42.656 --> 03:43.722
- Vinny! Can you get him off?
- Yeah.

03:43.791 --> 03:44.923
Can we put a
muzzle on him please?

03:44.992 --> 03:46.491
- [indistinct].
- I'm done. I'm done.

03:46.560 --> 03:47.726
- We've got to get
this guy off the stage.

03:47.795 --> 03:49.228
- You'd be a great winery host.
- Yeah.

03:49.296 --> 03:50.529
- I would love it.

03:50.598 --> 03:52.130
- But let's kick things
off with this season's

03:52.199 --> 03:54.099
first family vacation.

03:54.168 --> 03:57.502
Some of the roommates didn't
even know where El Paso was,

03:57.571 --> 04:01.073
but tacos and line dancing
had them shouting yee-haw!

04:01.141 --> 04:02.841
- Yee-haw, bitches!

04:02.910 --> 04:05.477
- Whoo!

04:05.546 --> 04:07.312
- El Paso show.

04:07.381 --> 04:09.448
Babe, I got booked in El Paso.

04:09.516 --> 04:11.083
- Have you ever
been to El Paso?

04:11.151 --> 04:12.884
- I've never been to El Paso.

04:12.953 --> 04:14.386
- Are we saying it right?

04:14.455 --> 04:16.121
- Buddy, where's El Paso?

04:16.190 --> 04:17.122
- Oh yeah!

04:17.191 --> 04:20.259
El Paso, yeah.

04:20.327 --> 04:21.593
UTVs!

04:21.662 --> 04:24.563
UTVs!

04:24.632 --> 04:28.033
- Here I come!

04:28.102 --> 04:32.170
- Vinny drives like my
grandmother who never drove.

04:32.239 --> 04:33.639
He's just like,
err-err-err-err.

04:33.707 --> 04:37.142
Like, gas, stop, gas, stop.

04:37.211 --> 04:39.745
all: Line dancing guidos!

04:39.813 --> 04:42.614
- Boogie woogie woogie.
Oh! Whoa!

04:42.683 --> 04:45.050
- It's like Nicole is
dancing with her future self.

04:45.119 --> 04:46.585
- You know, I was on
"Dancing with the Stars"

04:46.654 --> 04:48.387
but only seven weeks.
- Oh.

04:48.455 --> 04:49.588
You trying to twist me?

04:49.657 --> 04:51.223
Why are you backing
me up like this?

04:51.292 --> 04:52.224
- I'm dying.

04:52.293 --> 04:53.558
I can't do this.

04:53.627 --> 04:56.228
- We are getting dressed
up today, people.

04:56.297 --> 04:57.729
- What in the world?

04:57.798 --> 04:59.264
- Deena, for
some reason, thought

04:59.333 --> 05:00.966
I was going to get this cowboy
hat over the blowout,

05:01.068 --> 05:01.967
which I can't do.

05:02.069 --> 05:03.468
- Yee-haw!

05:03.537 --> 05:08.874
- Ladies and
gentlemen, DJ Pauly D!

05:08.942 --> 05:12.411
- Yeah, buddy!

05:12.479 --> 05:13.478
<i> What a night.</i>

05:13.547 --> 05:15.013
<i> El Paso was lit.</i>

05:15.115 --> 05:16.481
These people turn up.

05:16.550 --> 05:17.716
I love coming to Texas.

05:17.785 --> 05:20.552
- I haven't had this
much fun in so long.

05:20.621 --> 05:21.687
- Oh yeah!

05:21.755 --> 05:25.524
El Paso, yeah!

05:25.592 --> 05:27.426
- We were getting
chased on the way home.

05:27.494 --> 05:28.960
- Yes.
- From the show.

05:29.029 --> 05:30.529
- We literally were.
- It felt like the Beatles.

05:30.597 --> 05:32.197
- Shut down the whole city.
- It was crazy.

05:32.266 --> 05:33.632
- Amazing.
- It was awesome.

05:33.701 --> 05:36.034
- So Nicole, what was your
favorite part about El Paso?

05:36.136 --> 05:37.202
- I love line dancing.

05:37.271 --> 05:38.637
I feel like we've
done it before,

05:38.706 --> 05:40.339
and I just feel like
it's so much fun.

05:40.407 --> 05:42.974
I like country music,
and I love dive bars.

05:43.043 --> 05:44.343
- Yeah, you were at home.

05:44.411 --> 05:47.145
Now, the first thing
everyone did was ride UTVs.

05:47.214 --> 05:49.915
Vinny, Jenni said you were
driving like a grandma.

05:49.983 --> 05:51.650
- I just don't know how
I ended up in the car

05:51.719 --> 05:53.485
with Jenni, who gets carsick--

05:53.554 --> 05:54.786
- Yeah.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.121
- From driving in an Escalade.
- Poor thing.

05:56.190 --> 05:57.389
- I wanted to drive.

05:57.458 --> 05:59.691
- And Deena, who was
like, having a panic

05:59.760 --> 06:00.892
attack the whole time.

06:00.961 --> 06:02.260
- I kept my [bleep]
together back there.

06:02.329 --> 06:03.729
- We were literally the
three worst people--

06:03.797 --> 06:05.364
- It was the worst.
- To be in an ATV together.

06:05.432 --> 06:08.467
- I was like, the mom driving
the kids to erctice.

06:08.535 --> 06:11.536
- So now Angelina, you
decided to skip this trip.

06:11.605 --> 06:13.805
[together]
Oooh.

06:13.874 --> 06:15.140
- I knew that was coming.

06:15.209 --> 06:17.109
I knew that was coming.
- I knew that was coming.

06:17.177 --> 06:18.243
- Fight.

06:18.312 --> 06:19.611
- Did you have FOMO
watching it back?

06:19.680 --> 06:22.381
- Of course, because I
love hanging out with them,

06:22.449 --> 06:23.715
especially my meatballs.

06:23.784 --> 06:24.983
They drink with me.
- What about us?

06:25.052 --> 06:26.218
What about us?
- You guys, too.

06:26.286 --> 06:27.853
- I always go to
all your shows.

06:27.921 --> 06:30.789
- Me and Mike at that time,
we were not at a good place,

06:30.858 --> 06:32.824
but I don't think I really
didn't go because of that.

06:32.893 --> 06:35.093
It was more like I
had so much going on

06:35.162 --> 06:38.864
back at home that I just
felt like, for me, I needed

06:38.932 --> 06:40.465
to just take this one off.

06:40.534 --> 06:41.466
- Got you.

06:41.535 --> 06:42.634
- Yeah.

06:42.703 --> 06:44.069
- She was going through
a lot back home.

06:44.138 --> 06:45.570
[together]
A lot of [bleep].

06:45.639 --> 06:47.172
[laughter]

06:47.241 --> 06:48.340
- Oh my God.

06:48.409 --> 06:49.341
- That was a good
alley, good alley oop.

06:49.410 --> 06:50.342
- I'm dead.
Yes.

06:50.411 --> 06:51.476
- Yeah.

06:51.545 --> 06:53.011
- The crew fell in
love with El Paso,

06:53.080 --> 06:56.648
and for Mike,
it was love at first taco.

06:56.717 --> 06:58.950
<i> [upbeat music]</i>

06:59.019 --> 07:01.820
<i> - There's an unconfirmed</i>
<i> rumor that the finest</i>

07:01.889 --> 07:05.424
tacos in the area are
actually in El Paso.

07:05.492 --> 07:06.458
Oh damn.

07:06.527 --> 07:09.728
<i> [quirky music]</i>

07:09.797 --> 07:10.962
Yo, that was good.

07:11.064 --> 07:13.398
- All Mike talks
about is not eating,

07:13.467 --> 07:17.369
but all I ever see
him doing is eating.

07:17.438 --> 07:18.603
Make it make sense.

think you actually took down?

07:47.167 --> 07:48.633
- I don't know, 15?
- Damn.

07:48.702 --> 07:49.901

- 15?

07:49.970 --> 07:51.203
- Yeah.

07:51.271 --> 07:53.305
- Now no one loved the
taco tour more than Mike,

07:53.373 --> 07:56.241
so it's only right we
let him have some more.

07:56.310 --> 07:58.643
We split the roommates
into three teams.

07:58.712 --> 08:02.280
We got Vinny and Angelina
on Team Staten Island.

08:02.349 --> 08:03.882

- Nice.

08:03.951 --> 08:06.184
- Deena and Nicole

08:06.253 --> 08:07.986

- Yeah!

on Team DJWOWW.

08:11.191 --> 08:13.325

08:13.393 --> 08:16.495

backstage before the show.

08:16.563 --> 08:18.597
both: The meatballs
are going to win.

08:18.665 --> 08:19.831
- Jinx.
- Ditto.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.766
- Now Mike,
as a taco connoisseur,

08:21.835 --> 08:24.636
you will try each one
and pick your favorite.

08:24.705 --> 08:28.106
I know I don't need to ask, but
are you ready for some tacos?

08:28.175 --> 08:29.274
- Oh, I was born ready.

- Oh.

- Calm down.

08:40.888 --> 08:42.020
- Exciting.

08:42.122 --> 08:43.822

at these I could

08:43.891 --> 08:46.057

but I'm not going to--

08:46.126 --> 08:47.459

clean, keep the T-shirt clean.

08:53.901 --> 08:56.935

This one is a little--
- Ew!

09:06.880 --> 09:08.013

09:08.081 --> 09:09.247
- Yeah.

09:09.316 --> 09:10.549
- I can tell because
it's a little tuna,

09:10.617 --> 09:14.252

a little, a little messy.

09:14.321 --> 09:17.289

09:17.357 --> 09:18.790
- That's a Staten
Island taco, Mike.

09:18.859 --> 09:20.325
- This is definitely
a Staten Island taco.

09:20.394 --> 09:21.326
Yeah.
- Yeah.

09:21.395 --> 09:22.327
- Some payback.

09:22.396 --> 09:23.395
- Payback.

09:23.463 --> 09:24.963
I got to do more.

09:25.032 --> 09:28.433
- In that one, Mike, it's tuna,
lettuce, jalapeños, peas, two

09:28.502 --> 09:32.437
pieces of penne pasta, and it's
called a Staten Island Ferry.

09:32.506 --> 09:34.105
- Two pieces of penne pasta.

09:34.174 --> 09:36.341
- It definitely was a
Staten Island Ferry,

09:36.410 --> 09:37.742
but it wasn't bad though.

09:37.811 --> 09:38.743
It wasn't bad.
- It wasn't bad? OK.

Well, it's time for taco two.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.555
- Maybe there's
lobster in here, maybe?

09:50.624 --> 09:52.223
- OK.

09:52.292 --> 09:54.292
- Maybe some jalapeños,

Second bite.

- Chris booked the wrong Amy.

14:32.739 --> 14:33.771
- Yeah.

14:33.840 --> 14:35.607
- He tried his best.
- He's like,

14:35.675 --> 14:36.875
do you think I
have Amy Schumer's number?

14:36.943 --> 14:38.209
We're like, yeah.
I guess not.

14:38.278 --> 14:39.611
- Do you want to be a guest?

14:39.679 --> 14:41.713
- I would love to be a guest
on "The Meatball Show."

14:41.781 --> 14:43.214
- I would love to have you.
- Done.

14:43.283 --> 14:44.682
- Oh my gosh.
That would be amazing.

14:44.751 --> 14:46.317
- What's your favorite drink?

14:46.386 --> 14:48.786
- I like stuff that's
clear, but not tequila,

14:48.855 --> 14:50.255
so like vodka, white wine.

14:50.323 --> 14:51.256
- We got it.
Done. Noted.

14:51.324 --> 14:52.557
- Done.

14:52.626 --> 14:53.791
- I can't wait to be
on "The Meatball Show."

14:53.860 --> 14:55.026
Let's all get saucy.
Let's do it.

14:55.095 --> 14:56.294
- We can't wait to have you.
- All right.

14:56.363 --> 14:58.263
Now, she didn't
have a chauffeur,

14:58.331 --> 15:02.033
but everything and everyone was
driving Angelina up the wall

15:02.135 --> 15:03.334
this season.

15:03.403 --> 15:06.404
Things got so bad my
girl went to a priest.

15:06.473 --> 15:07.538
Jesus, take the wheel.

15:07.607 --> 15:08.506
- You need Jesus.

15:08.575 --> 15:09.507
- I can't.

15:09.576 --> 15:10.575
- Hello?

15:10.644 --> 15:12.210
What the [bleep]?

15:12.279 --> 15:14.946
<i> I had a lot of fun in Spain,</i>
<i> met so many great people.</i>

15:15.015 --> 15:15.947
Chris?

15:16.016 --> 15:16.948
Hello?

15:17.017 --> 15:18.383
[bleep] not good right now.

15:18.451 --> 15:19.684
Hello?

15:19.753 --> 15:21.085
And then of course he's
nowhere to be found.

15:21.154 --> 15:23.621
<i> This is the perfect</i>
<i> representation</i>

15:23.690 --> 15:28.192
<i> of how our relationship</i>
<i> is as a whole, so...</i>

15:28.261 --> 15:30.361
In Florida, I thought
things were taking

15:30.430 --> 15:33.164
a turn for the better, and
then on our two-year wedding

15:33.233 --> 15:36.301
anniversary, he said, I hope
you die in a plane crash.

15:36.369 --> 15:39.203
Me and my husband
have not had sex.

15:39.272 --> 15:42.006
- How many times did you like
have sex in your marriage?

15:42.075 --> 15:43.675
- Once.

15:43.743 --> 15:45.143
- Oh, Angela.

15:45.211 --> 15:46.678
<i> - Listen, I don't need a</i>
<i> whole bunch of attention,</i>

15:46.746 --> 15:48.012
but just give me
something, Chris.

15:48.081 --> 15:50.682
And I'm sorry, but I
can't do this anymore.

15:50.750 --> 15:53.251
<i> Louis, I have to say</i>
<i> like, he helps my mind</i>

15:53.320 --> 15:54.619
realize that I'm worth more.

15:54.688 --> 15:55.853
- You never hooked up with him?

15:55.922 --> 15:57.588
- I swear to God,
we didn't do anything.

15:57.657 --> 15:58.756
- You cuddled.

15:58.825 --> 15:59.757
And you slept in the bed.
- We cuddled.

15:59.826 --> 16:00.725
Yeah.
Oh [bleep].

16:00.794 --> 16:01.726
What the [bleep]?

16:01.795 --> 16:03.728
- Is this him?

16:03.797 --> 16:05.563
Did you and Angelina
ever have sex?

16:05.632 --> 16:06.831
- [bleep] my life.

16:06.900 --> 16:08.433
[bleep] my life.

16:08.501 --> 16:09.734
<i> - It's not called sex.</i>

16:09.803 --> 16:11.202
<i> It's making love.</i>

16:11.271 --> 16:12.203
- [screams]

16:12.272 --> 16:13.471
- You did.

16:13.540 --> 16:14.505
You did.

16:14.574 --> 16:16.074
You liar.

16:16.176 --> 16:17.608
- This is something
that is hard

16:17.677 --> 16:20.078
that many people
go through, but I

16:20.180 --> 16:23.014
also don't think it's the end.

16:23.083 --> 16:25.550
- What is the point of
[bleep] being married?

16:25.618 --> 16:27.385
<i> - Angelina definitely</i>
<i> deserves better.</i>

16:27.454 --> 16:29.120
Just get a divorce,
and be happy.

16:29.189 --> 16:31.422
I'm so excited for you to
get divorced because you

16:31.491 --> 16:32.623
shouldn't be in this marriage.

16:32.692 --> 16:33.891
- Cheers to you guys.

16:33.960 --> 16:38.429
Never again will I let
a man bring me down.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.365
- Amen.

16:40.433 --> 16:43.835
- Divorce is always difficult,
so how are you doing now?

16:43.903 --> 16:45.837
Is the divorce official?

16:45.905 --> 16:46.971
- It's finalized.

16:47.040 --> 16:48.206
- Nice.

16:48.274 --> 16:49.674
Congrats.
Yes.

16:49.743 --> 16:50.975
Now we can clap.

16:51.044 --> 16:52.410
- Hot girl summer.

16:52.479 --> 16:54.512
- Now ladies, did you realize
that things had gotten

16:54.581 --> 16:56.014
that bad in her marriage?

16:56.082 --> 16:58.349
- I mean, I feel like
we knew it was bad,

16:58.418 --> 17:00.284
and we were just waiting
for her to like admit it.

17:00.353 --> 17:01.753
- Right.
- Right.

17:01.821 --> 17:03.988
- I think we were also happy
that she was like, I'm done,

17:04.057 --> 17:05.189
moving on.
- Yeah.

17:05.258 --> 17:06.557
- I'm going to be
happy for myself,

17:06.626 --> 17:07.825
so we were happy for her.

17:07.894 --> 17:09.927
- Like, going through
that behind closed doors,

17:09.996 --> 17:12.663
you know, I was
trying to like keep

17:12.732 --> 17:14.665
that kind of away from
you guys a little bit

17:14.734 --> 17:16.901
because it was really that bad.

17:16.970 --> 17:19.270
Going to them and
just like, finally

17:19.339 --> 17:21.606
being able to just
say, hey, listen,

17:21.674 --> 17:23.307
this is what's happening.

17:23.376 --> 17:24.609
This is not good.

17:24.677 --> 17:26.110
It's something I needed.

17:26.179 --> 17:29.480
- Now, Deena, Angelina told
you she went away with Louis

17:29.549 --> 17:32.183
but swore nothing
happened, but then Louis

17:32.252 --> 17:33.484
called and blew up her spot.

17:33.553 --> 17:36.320
Did you think she was
BSing you the whole time?

17:36.389 --> 17:38.589
- So a little bit.

17:38.658 --> 17:41.092
I'm like,
just tell me the truth,

17:41.161 --> 17:44.095
and then when he told me
the truth, I was like--

17:44.164 --> 17:45.963
so I've been sitting
here for four hours,

17:46.032 --> 17:49.600
and you've just been lying
to my ass for four hours.

17:49.669 --> 17:51.069
- But wait.

17:51.137 --> 17:53.538
There was one part though
that you asked if we had sex,

17:53.606 --> 17:55.840
I think, in the
show, off our shore.

17:55.909 --> 17:58.009
- I did bring up Mexico.

17:58.078 --> 17:59.477
You didn't admit it at all.

17:59.546 --> 18:00.745
- I didn't really go--

18:00.814 --> 18:02.647
I went around about
it, kind of, like, oh.

18:02.715 --> 18:03.981
Like laughing.

18:04.050 --> 18:07.085
- I love you, Ang, but you
never said that you did.

18:07.153 --> 18:08.820
And then he's the
one that admitted it,

18:08.888 --> 18:10.955
and that's why you ran
in a corner and you hid.

18:11.024 --> 18:12.390
- Well, because honestly
like my sex life--

18:12.459 --> 18:13.758
- I know.

18:13.827 --> 18:15.460
- --is kind of my business,
and at that point--

18:15.528 --> 18:16.694
- Not on a reality
reality show.

18:16.763 --> 18:17.862
- At that point in
my life, I was really

18:17.931 --> 18:18.896
like closed off to everything.

18:18.965 --> 18:19.897
- That's fine.

18:19.966 --> 18:21.365
- It is what it is.

18:21.434 --> 18:22.600
- Well, you know what?
Listen, for you guys it is,

18:22.669 --> 18:24.235
but for me I kind of
was like, you know what?

18:24.304 --> 18:27.238
Like in "All-Star Shore,"
when I filmed, I did

18:27.307 --> 18:28.506
not have sex with that man.

18:28.575 --> 18:30.208
- Well, you know what?
Lewis is old news anyway.

18:30.276 --> 18:31.776
- He is-- He really is.
- The wine was flowing.

18:31.845 --> 18:33.111
- He really is.
He really is.

18:33.179 --> 18:34.345
- He's had like seven
side pieces since then.

18:34.414 --> 18:35.880
- Shut the [bleep] up.
- That's you.

18:35.949 --> 18:37.815
Now I gotta ask you because
you said you weren't having

18:37.884 --> 18:38.783
a lot of sex in the marriage.

18:38.852 --> 18:40.084
How is the sex life now?

18:40.153 --> 18:41.686
- I'm having sex now.

18:41.754 --> 18:42.687
- Period.

18:42.755 --> 18:43.754
- OK.

18:43.823 --> 18:45.456
- Get it, girl.

18:45.525 --> 18:46.457
- With Vinny or--

18:46.526 --> 18:48.092
- City boys up.

18:48.161 --> 18:49.327
- It's not you, you [bleep].

18:49.395 --> 18:50.895
- Any-- any sex with
Vinny recently or--

18:50.964 --> 18:52.296
- No.

18:52.365 --> 18:53.297
I just [bleep] him a little
bit. No, I'm kidding.

18:53.366 --> 18:54.966
- Oh, no.
No. Just-- Just--

18:55.034 --> 18:57.068
- Are you dating
anyone seriously, Ang?

18:57.137 --> 18:58.269
- I'm--

18:58.338 --> 18:59.437
- Or are you enjoying
the single life?

18:59.506 --> 19:00.605
- I'm just enjoying
the single life.

19:00.673 --> 19:02.106
- She's a lot happier now.
- Yeah.

19:02.175 --> 19:05.743
- Well, coming up next, Mike
puts the shady in Slim Shady

19:05.812 --> 19:07.178
this season.

19:07.247 --> 19:09.981
Is the old Sitch
officially dead and gone?

19:10.049 --> 19:10.982
- Find out next.

19:11.050 --> 19:13.618
all: Ohh! Yeah!

19:13.686 --> 19:14.652
- Oh, [bleep].

19:14.721 --> 19:18.356
- I don't know.
I don't know.

19:18.424 --> 19:20.291
- For me, you really
hurt my feelings.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.360
- When you hang
around clowns,

19:22.428 --> 19:25.329
don't be surprised that your
life becomes a circus.

19:25.398 --> 19:28.099
- Mike, is the old
Sitch gone for good?

19:28.168 --> 19:30.268
- Um...
- Here we go.

19:30.336 --> 19:32.470
<i> - ♪ If you wanna have fun</i>
<i> then do something crazy ♪</i>

19:34.340 --> 19:36.440
<i> - ♪ Get crazy, get wild,</i>
<i> let's party, get loud ♪</i>

19:36.509 --> 19:38.342
<i> ♪ ♪</i>

19:38.411 --> 19:41.379
- We're back with everyone's
favorite roommates.

19:41.447 --> 19:44.682
Angelina's divorce brought an
old face back to the shore.

19:44.751 --> 19:47.018
Mike tried to resist
stirring the pot,

19:47.086 --> 19:49.453
but as his hair went
to the light side,

19:49.522 --> 19:50.955
he turned to the dark side.

19:51.024 --> 19:52.423
Take a look.

19:52.492 --> 19:54.392
- Everyone knows being sober
is probably the best thing

19:54.460 --> 19:56.694
I've ever done for myself,
because all my energy that

19:56.763 --> 19:59.163
was directed towards
negativity is now directed

19:59.232 --> 20:00.164
towards everything positive.

20:00.233 --> 20:01.165
- Angelina.

20:01.234 --> 20:02.967
- [laughs]

20:03.036 --> 20:05.403
- Yo, Pauly, old Sitch
wants to expose Angelina,

20:05.471 --> 20:07.972
but the new Sitch is
like, nah, I'm a good guy.

20:08.041 --> 20:11.142
- The side piece reached out
to me, sent a ton of receipts,

20:11.211 --> 20:13.878
and a couple hours later,
the husband reached out.

20:13.980 --> 20:15.513
So I recorded that [bleep].

20:15.582 --> 20:18.349
Do I stir the pot sometimes?

20:18.418 --> 20:19.383
Maybe.

20:19.452 --> 20:20.952
I got the information.

20:21.020 --> 20:22.420
It was so messy.

20:22.488 --> 20:23.721
- And it was too messy for
you, so you want to [bleep]--

20:23.723 --> 20:25.122
u  tmp
ere and st i

20:25.191 --> 20:26.557
- AAnd then you want tofor
you,be like, oh, [bleep].p]--

20:26.626 --> 20:28.092
Light the house on
fire, and then back up

20:28.161 --> 20:29.493
and be like, why is it on fire?

20:29.562 --> 20:30.695
I wouldn't have
done that to you.

20:30.763 --> 20:31.829
- OK.

20:31.898 --> 20:33.064
I understand-- I
kinda understand what

20:33.132 --> 20:34.765
you're getting at right now.

20:34.834 --> 20:36.434
<i> There's so much</i>
<i> dramers going on.</i>

20:36.502 --> 20:38.035
<i> It's easy to</i>
<i> forget about, like,</i>

20:38.104 --> 20:40.104
what's happening in
her life in general,

20:40.173 --> 20:42.006
the stress of a messy divorce.

20:42.075 --> 20:45.910
I made a mistake, OK,
and I'm owning up to it.

20:45.979 --> 20:48.646
I answered a phone call and I
take accountability for that.

20:48.715 --> 20:50.848
<i> - Mike is definitely</i>
<i> involving himself</i>

20:50.917 --> 20:54.185
in a lot of people's business,
a lot of people's drama,

20:54.254 --> 20:56.954
and that's exactly what
the old Sitch used to do.

20:57.023 --> 20:58.222
- Who's gonna be the bad guy?

20:58.291 --> 20:59.924
Situation.

20:59.993 --> 21:01.892
No problem.

21:01.961 --> 21:03.427
- Oh, my God.

21:03.496 --> 21:05.563
- Damn, Vin, what the hell?

21:05.632 --> 21:07.164
- Vinny, I thought
you liked Mike.

21:07.233 --> 21:08.432
- Wow.
- What the hell?

21:08.501 --> 21:10.835
He was like-- He was
narrating that all solo.

21:10.903 --> 21:12.470
- He was waiting for
this day to come.

21:12.538 --> 21:14.238
- I was like, I got this, guys.
- See, you said you weren't on.

21:14.307 --> 21:15.306
There you go.
- Hi, Mike.

21:15.375 --> 21:17.341
- Now, Mike,
you went full blond

21:17.410 --> 21:19.944
and slowly regressed
into the old Sitch.

21:20.013 --> 21:22.713
Now, was it, like, the hair
dye--'cause if so,

21:22.782 --> 21:23.948
let me know so I stay
away from that brand.

21:24.017 --> 21:25.316
- You know what?

21:25.385 --> 21:27.318
I--I think all of us go through
an internal

21:27.387 --> 21:28.653
struggle once in a while.

21:28.721 --> 21:31.055
And every now and then,
an issue may arise that,

21:31.124 --> 21:33.658
you know, you may
think about regressing.

21:33.726 --> 21:38.129
And I think you saw my struggle
this season where, you know,

21:38.197 --> 21:41.399
I thought one of my friends
was being not as transparent

21:41.501 --> 21:43.134
as we would have liked, maybe.

21:43.202 --> 21:44.568
You know, I-- like
I said, it's--

21:44.637 --> 21:47.772
It's not where you start a
race, but how you finish it.

21:47.840 --> 21:50.941
And I think we got
where we needed to get.

21:51.010 --> 21:53.110
But also, let's
just point out--

21:53.179 --> 21:54.278
- Here we go.

21:54.347 --> 21:56.247
- When you hang
around clowns, don't

21:56.316 --> 21:57.715
be surprised that your
life becomes a circus.

21:57.784 --> 21:58.783
- Ah.

21:58.851 --> 21:59.884
- And that's what
the season became.

21:59.952 --> 22:00.885
- But the thing is--

22:00.953 --> 22:02.687
is for me really
hurt my feelings.

22:02.755 --> 22:05.656
And like, I know that
now we went through it

22:05.725 --> 22:08.326
and, like, we got through
it, but, like, in that state

22:08.394 --> 22:10.995
of mind that I was in and
in that whole scenario,

22:11.064 --> 22:12.897
like, that was very
hurtful for me.

22:12.965 --> 22:14.398
I know you the longest
out of everyone.

22:14.467 --> 22:16.100
I don't care how much of
a bond you had with them

22:16.169 --> 22:17.301
or how much history.
I'm saying--

22:17.370 --> 22:18.669
- I think I could have
handled it better.

22:18.738 --> 22:19.670
- You're not supposed to
believe other people--

22:19.739 --> 22:21.038
- Not necessarily.

22:21.107 --> 22:22.506
- --Cause you didn't
really know the full story.

22:22.575 --> 22:23.874
- You've-- you've admitted,
in the middle of the season,

22:23.943 --> 22:25.276
that you got the WAP.

22:25.345 --> 22:27.578
And you've admitted that there
was this gentleman in

22:27.647 --> 22:31.048
Old Bridge, and then there
was eventually also Louis,

22:31.117 --> 22:32.683
and they got mad at each other.

22:32.752 --> 22:34.852
And that's where people
came out of the streets

22:34.921 --> 22:36.320
to try to expose you.

22:36.389 --> 22:39.056
When it first came to me, I
was like, oh, my God, like,

22:39.125 --> 22:41.025
I'm privy to this
information and, like,

22:41.094 --> 22:42.326
what do I want to do with it?

22:42.395 --> 22:45.096
- Do you regret taking
this whole thing so far?

22:45.164 --> 22:46.931
- I didn't think
that I took it far.

22:46.999 --> 22:49.467
I think old Sitch would
have taken it way farther.

22:49.569 --> 22:50.901
You know what I'm saying?
Way father.

22:50.970 --> 22:52.303
- I mean--

22:52.372 --> 22:53.871
- You would have brought
the side pieces right here.

22:53.940 --> 22:55.106
- You know, I just
want you to understand

22:55.174 --> 22:56.307
where I'm coming from.
- No, I do.

22:56.376 --> 22:57.308
- I know we've already spoken--
- I do.

22:57.377 --> 22:58.376
- --About this--

22:58.444 --> 22:59.410
- I do.
- But we're here now.

22:59.479 --> 23:01.078
- I do understand.
I do.

23:01.147 --> 23:02.880
- I feel like everyone's owned
their [bleep] at this point.

23:02.949 --> 23:04.215
Like, he's owning his [bleep].

23:04.283 --> 23:06.283
You've owned your [bleep],
and, you know.

23:06.352 --> 23:07.718
- Yeah.

23:07.787 --> 23:09.887
Going forward I just hope
that that never happens again.

23:09.956 --> 23:12.156
Say somebody comes out of
the woodwork and is like,

23:12.225 --> 23:14.325
Angelina said this
and this and this.

23:14.394 --> 23:15.559
You guys come to me--

23:15.628 --> 23:18.095
You come to me,
and you say to me, hey,

23:18.164 --> 23:19.196
this is what I heard about you.

23:19.265 --> 23:20.364
Is it true or not?

23:20.433 --> 23:21.766
- OK.

23:21.834 --> 23:23.768
- So it sounds like, Sitch
and Angelina, you guys

23:23.836 --> 23:25.736
are in somewhat
of a good place.

23:25.805 --> 23:28.406
Mike, is the old
Sitch gone for good?

23:28.474 --> 23:29.774
- I believe so.
You know what I'm saying?

23:29.842 --> 23:31.075
But--

23:31.144 --> 23:32.309
- Well, we just brought
it back, so what's up?

23:32.378 --> 23:33.711
- But at the same time--

23:33.780 --> 23:35.646
No-- Me and Angeliners,
we're in an awesome place.

23:35.715 --> 23:36.847
- Yeah, we are, yes.
- We really are.

23:36.916 --> 23:38.149
We really are.
- I have to admit it, yes.

23:38.217 --> 23:39.650
- I really do love her,
but we're like family.

23:39.719 --> 23:41.252
We-- We fight hard,
but we love harder.

23:41.320 --> 23:42.620
That's how it is.

23:42.688 --> 23:45.089
- No one wins when the
family feuds, you know.

23:45.158 --> 23:48.058
Coming up, the roommates
answer more fan questions.

23:48.127 --> 23:52.096
Plus, who needs Carrie
Bradshaw when you got Vinny?

23:52.165 --> 23:55.065

right on Mrs. Right?

- So, Angelina, how's
the single life?

28:32.411 --> 28:33.510
- Vinny, how's the single life?

28:33.579 --> 28:35.446
- I do get lonely at times.

28:35.514 --> 28:38.282
- It takes Vinny
1.3 milliseconds

28:38.350 --> 28:39.416
to start flirting with me.

28:39.485 --> 28:40.718
- Wow.

28:40.786 --> 28:42.219
<i> - I love Vinny and</i>
<i> Angelina's relationship,</i>

28:42.288 --> 28:45.456
because they hate each other,
but I feel like they love

28:45.524 --> 28:47.224
each other at the same time.

28:47.326 --> 28:48.492
- You guys should just do it.
Yeah.

28:48.561 --> 28:50.194
- Bang it out.
- Vinny, just do it.

28:50.296 --> 28:51.762
- I'd rather jump
off this mountain.

28:51.831 --> 28:54.298
<i> - I initially thought that</i>
<i> nothing would ever happen</i>

28:54.366 --> 28:56.133
between Angelina and Vinny.

28:56.202 --> 28:58.535
- What is happening over there?

28:58.604 --> 29:02.840
- I'm starting to see a
little bit of sexual tension.

29:02.908 --> 29:04.975
I'm thinking to myself,
single Vingelina.

29:05.044 --> 29:06.376
It's happening.

29:06.445 --> 29:08.879
- Any guy I [bleep], they
don't ever want to leave it.

29:08.948 --> 29:10.547
- If your mouth game is
good, I'll think about it.

29:10.616 --> 29:11.548
- Wouldn't you want to know?

29:11.617 --> 29:12.683
- Vinny, just try it.

29:12.752 --> 29:14.618
- You wanna know,
but you don't know.

29:14.687 --> 29:17.921
If I ever sucked on Vinny's D,
I would use my [bleep] teeth.

29:17.990 --> 29:19.456
Like [bleep] corn
on the cob, bitch.

29:19.525 --> 29:20.657
- Oh, my God.

29:20.726 --> 29:23.227
- Aw, you and Angelina
are holding hands.

29:23.329 --> 29:24.461
- I'm a little
upset about this.

29:24.530 --> 29:26.230
- Make out.
- God.

29:26.332 --> 29:27.231
- OK.

29:27.333 --> 29:28.232
[together]
Ooh.

29:28.334 --> 29:29.733
- Ooh, Vinny.

29:29.802 --> 29:32.836
- So Vinny, what reignited
this flirtation with Angelina?

29:32.905 --> 29:34.738
Was it the new nose?

29:34.807 --> 29:36.473
- The new nose that
looks exactly the same?

29:36.542 --> 29:38.142
Yes.

29:38.210 --> 29:41.845
First of all,
Angelina is out of her mind.

29:41.914 --> 29:43.847
But there are some, like,
normal moments to her.

29:43.916 --> 29:44.948
Like she came to my--

29:45.017 --> 29:46.416
- So you're saying
there's a chance.

29:46.485 --> 29:47.885
- She came to my appearance
the other day, and she was,

29:47.953 --> 29:49.787
like, normal and quiet.

29:49.855 --> 29:50.921
And I'm like, who are you?

29:50.990 --> 29:53.457
And I have no problem
talking to her

29:53.526 --> 29:55.859
and being her friend
during those moments.

29:55.928 --> 29:57.761
And that's kind of
what you see there.

29:57.830 --> 30:00.564
And then everyone thinks that
we're in love with each other.

30:00.633 --> 30:03.200
- Ang, what are some things
that you like about Vinny?

30:03.269 --> 30:04.535
- Oh, yeah, tell us.

30:04.603 --> 30:05.769
- Oh, God.
- This ought to be good.

30:05.838 --> 30:08.539
You're very smart,
but I'm very smart too.

30:08.607 --> 30:11.074
So when I show you the smart
part of me, you like it.

30:11.143 --> 30:12.676
- Make out,

30:12.745 --> 30:15.879
[together] Make out, make out,
make out, make out, make out.

30:15.948 --> 30:16.947
- Well, there is
something we've

30:17.016 --> 30:18.248
been wanting to tell you guys.

30:18.317 --> 30:19.249
- We're dating now.

30:19.318 --> 30:20.250
- We are.

30:20.319 --> 30:21.685
[together]
Ooh.

30:21.754 --> 30:22.719
- Psyche.

30:22.788 --> 30:23.720
- Like, just do it.

30:23.789 --> 30:24.721
- Why not?

30:24.790 --> 30:25.856
- Like, just get it over with.

30:25.925 --> 30:27.124
- There's obvious
sexual tension there.

30:27.193 --> 30:28.125
- Yeah.
- You know?

30:28.194 --> 30:29.293
And I think once--

30:29.361 --> 30:30.460
- Bro, stop stirring
the pot, dude.

30:30.529 --> 30:31.628
- And they're both
from Staten Island.

30:31.697 --> 30:33.230
Also, he liked her
in high school.

30:33.299 --> 30:34.231
- Ooh.
- Sure did.

30:34.300 --> 30:35.465
- Yeah.

30:35.534 --> 30:36.533
- Why do you think
he moved back East?

30:36.602 --> 30:38.101
It wasn't because
of his mother.

30:38.170 --> 30:39.636
They're even sitting
together at the reunion.

30:39.705 --> 30:40.671
- Yeah.
- This isn't assigned seats.

30:40.739 --> 30:41.805
- Yeah.

30:41.874 --> 30:42.773
Oh, they just-- They
chose those, huh?

30:42.842 --> 30:44.007
- Yes.

30:44.076 --> 30:45.075
- You show me your
[bleep] all the time.

30:45.144 --> 30:46.043
You're like,
let me see your [bleep].

30:46.111 --> 30:47.211
- Oh, wow.
- What?

30:47.279 --> 30:48.378
- I mean-- I mean
show me your [bleep].

30:48.447 --> 30:49.580
- See what I mean?
- No, you're right.

30:49.648 --> 30:50.714
- Yeah, you do say that.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:50.783 --> 30:52.249
- But wait. Wait.
You let me look at it.

30:52.318 --> 30:53.584
- When?
- Oh, wow.

30:53.652 --> 30:54.918
- You were like,
look at my [bleep].

30:54.987 --> 30:56.186
- When?
- Wait.

30:56.255 --> 30:57.554
- In the room that time.

30:57.623 --> 30:58.755
- What time?

30:58.824 --> 31:00.891
- This is live.
This is live.

31:00.960 --> 31:02.426
- Are you serious?

31:02.494 --> 31:03.727
- Wait, wait, what?
- Please share.

31:03.796 --> 31:04.895
- Yeah, tell me.

31:04.964 --> 31:06.964
- In San Diego,
I went into your room.

31:07.032 --> 31:08.599
You were growing like
a [bleep] Chia Pet.

31:08.667 --> 31:09.600
- Oh, wow.

31:09.668 --> 31:10.601
- No, no, no, no.

31:10.669 --> 31:11.735
- What?

31:11.804 --> 31:12.736
- I never said,
look at my [bleep].

31:12.805 --> 31:13.804
Or maybe I was
like, look at it.

31:13.873 --> 31:15.372
It's not [bleep].

31:15.474 --> 31:16.506
- Oh my God.
- What the [bleep]?

31:16.575 --> 31:17.507
- Oh, wow.
- I don't know.

31:17.576 --> 31:18.609
It's not what it looks like.

31:18.677 --> 31:19.977
It's not what it
looks like, guys.

31:20.045 --> 31:21.678
I can explain.

31:21.747 --> 31:22.913
- All right.
- My God.

31:22.982 --> 31:25.883
- But listen, if the
drunken stars aligned,

31:25.951 --> 31:27.918
do you think we could at least
have, like, some hate sex?

31:27.987 --> 31:28.919
- Yeah.
- Hell yeah.

31:28.988 --> 31:30.153
- Like-- You know, like--

31:30.222 --> 31:31.588
Like enemies with benefits.
- Hell yeah.

31:31.657 --> 31:33.023
- Come on, Vin.

31:33.092 --> 31:34.591
- He acts like I'm the worst
possible thing to bang.

31:34.660 --> 31:36.660
But in real life,
he would bang me.

31:36.729 --> 31:37.828
- Yeah.

31:37.897 --> 31:39.997
- No.
- All right.

31:40.065 --> 31:42.900
Coming up, Jenni puts aside
her fear of public speaking

31:42.968 --> 31:44.067
for a higher cause.

31:44.136 --> 31:46.136
[together]
Aww.

31:46.205 --> 31:47.838
- We watch a
moment that brought

31:47.907 --> 31:49.840
her roommates to tears, next.

31:49.909 --> 31:53.143
- Aww, OK.

31:53.212 --> 31:55.746
<i> ♪ ♪</i>

31:55.814 --> 31:57.281
- Now, Jenni, you've
had some trouble

31:57.349 --> 31:58.715
with speeches in the past.

31:58.784 --> 31:59.850
- Here we go.

31:59.919 --> 32:02.586
- Never have I ever
had a threesome.

32:02.655 --> 32:03.687
[laughter]

32:03.756 --> 32:05.289
- Jenni.

32:05.357 --> 32:07.324
<i> - ♪ If you wanna have fun</i>
<i> then do something crazy ♪</i>

32:09.194 --> 32:11.595
<i> - ♪ Get crazy, get wild,</i>
<i> let's party, get loud ♪</i>

32:11.664 --> 32:14.064
<i> ♪ ♪</i>

32:14.133 --> 32:17.968
- Public speaking is not easy,
but Jenni faced her fears

32:18.037 --> 32:20.737
to raise awareness about
those like her son Greyson

32:20.806 --> 32:23.307
living with sensory needs
and invisible disabilities.

32:23.375 --> 32:24.908
- I'm gonna cry.

32:24.977 --> 32:27.511
<i> So, tonight is a</i>
<i> really exciting night.</i>

32:27.579 --> 32:28.912
- Here, put this on.

32:28.981 --> 32:33.383
- Culture City is a charity
that I'm on the board of,

32:33.452 --> 32:37.421
and we help children
and adults with autism,

32:37.489 --> 32:38.889
with-- with sensory needs.

32:38.958 --> 32:41.058
Mommy gets nervous
when I do speeches,

32:41.126 --> 32:42.492
and I have to do one tonight.

32:42.561 --> 32:44.861
<i> One of my biggest fears</i>
<i> is public speaking.</i>

32:44.930 --> 32:47.864
I have stage fright,
and I just hate speeches.

32:47.933 --> 32:50.133
[cheers and applause]

32:53.038 --> 32:56.707
At Culture City, we
create sensory accessibility

32:56.775 --> 32:59.676
and inclusion for those
with invisible disabilities.

32:59.745 --> 33:02.045
By telling Greyson's
story, Greyson

33:02.114 --> 33:04.147
has become a hero to so many.

33:04.216 --> 33:05.916
His journey helps
other families

33:05.985 --> 33:08.285
know there are people
like myself fighting

33:08.354 --> 33:10.087
to make the limits limitless.

33:10.155 --> 33:11.088
- Yay, Grey.

33:11.156 --> 33:12.389
- Yeah, Grey.
- Yeah, Grey.

33:12.458 --> 33:17.361
- [indistinct].

33:17.429 --> 33:18.996
- And I don't really know how--

33:19.064 --> 33:24.234
It's just like I'm really glad
I have a brother like this.

33:24.303 --> 33:26.603
And he's always so supportive.

33:26.672 --> 33:29.373
- This moment could
not be more perfect.

33:29.441 --> 33:33.076
Greyson has overcome
so many obstacles in life

33:33.145 --> 33:36.580
<i> that I just could not</i>
<i> be more of a proud mom.</i>

33:36.648 --> 33:42.986
To my hero, Greyson,
Mommy is so proud of you.

33:43.055 --> 33:45.322
[applause]

33:45.391 --> 33:46.356
- God bless.

33:46.425 --> 33:47.791
You did so good, Jenni.

33:47.893 --> 33:48.959
- Aw, thanks.
I'm crying.

33:49.028 --> 33:50.427
- Your kids are so beautiful.

33:50.496 --> 33:52.229
And Meilani did such a good
job as well with the speech.

33:52.297 --> 33:53.864
- She crushed it, yeah.
- Such a great job.

33:53.932 --> 33:55.399
- Aw, Jenni.
- Never again, though.

33:55.467 --> 33:56.500
- One and done.
- One and done.

33:56.568 --> 33:57.501
- So proud.

33:57.569 --> 33:58.735
- So, so great.

33:58.804 --> 33:59.903
- Now, Jenni,
you've had some trouble

33:59.972 --> 34:01.405
with speeches in the past.

34:01.473 --> 34:04.041
How did you overcome your
fear of public speaking

34:04.109 --> 34:05.475
to get through this one?

34:05.544 --> 34:08.545
- I didn't, but I had
my kids by my side.

34:08.614 --> 34:12.582
And you have to put your
fears aside for your children.

34:12.651 --> 34:15.052
And I was not going
to let them see

34:15.120 --> 34:17.654
my fear, especially
Greyson because he's

34:17.723 --> 34:19.689
scared of those situations.
- Right.

34:19.758 --> 34:23.093
- And how am I supposed
to be scared when my son

34:23.162 --> 34:24.661
is the one with the diagnosis?

34:24.730 --> 34:26.263
So I had to be brave for him.

34:26.331 --> 34:27.464
- That's amazing.

34:27.533 --> 34:29.900
- I just find it so
crazy because my bestie,

34:29.968 --> 34:31.868
she's always like,
I hate speaking in public.

34:31.937 --> 34:33.603
Like I hate, like,
the center of attention.

34:33.672 --> 34:35.439
Then she gets on
stage, always kills it.

34:35.507 --> 34:36.239
Oh.

34:36.308 --> 34:37.674
Soud of her.

34:37.743 --> 34:41.511
- And just, when Greyson
ran up and, like, hugged her.

34:41.580 --> 34:42.712
<i> - Oh, my God we</i>
<i> were all waterworks.</i>

34:42.781 --> 34:43.780
<i> - I was like--</i>
<i> - Yeah.</i>

34:43.849 --> 34:44.981
- I was like, that's it for me.

34:45.050 --> 34:46.583
Like I can't.

34:46.652 --> 34:48.652
- He heard me on the screen and
he thought I was calling him.

34:48.720 --> 34:49.786
- So amazing.

34:49.855 --> 34:52.055
- We're super proud of--
Mama WOWW.

34:52.124 --> 34:53.223
- Thanks, guys.

34:53.292 --> 34:56.059
- So much love in
the room that night.

34:56.128 --> 34:58.762
But it's time to
put the kids to bed,

34:58.831 --> 35:00.931
because Nicole taught
us how to suppress

35:00.999 --> 35:02.432
the gag reflex this season.

35:02.501 --> 35:03.733
- [laughs]
- All right.

35:03.802 --> 35:04.734
Coming up--

35:04.803 --> 35:05.902
- No.

35:05.971 --> 35:07.104
- What other sex
tricks do the roommates

35:07.172 --> 35:08.071
have up their sleeves?

35:08.140 --> 35:09.072
- Oh, boy.

35:09.141 --> 35:10.140
- Sex is next.

35:10.209 --> 35:11.141
- Yay.

35:11.210 --> 35:12.275
- Oh, boy.

35:12.344 --> 35:13.276
- No gag reflex?
I have no gag reflex.

35:13.345 --> 35:14.611
- Double Shot taught me that.

35:14.680 --> 35:15.745
- Wow.
- Wait.

35:15.814 --> 35:17.013
- The Double Shot
girls taught us that.

35:17.082 --> 35:18.715
- Wait.
- By the way.

35:18.784 --> 35:20.150
- Oh, yeah?
Deena, really?

35:20.219 --> 35:21.852
I didn't know Deena was
Little Miss No Gag Reflex.

35:21.920 --> 35:22.853
- Oh, my God.

35:22.921 --> 35:23.854
- Wow.

35:23.922 --> 35:24.921
- I'm a mother of three.

35:24.990 --> 35:26.323
Delete that.

35:26.391 --> 35:28.391
- Angelina, we learned
your vagina has a nickname.

35:28.460 --> 35:29.392
Why Brenda?

35:29.461 --> 35:30.727
- I like Brenda.

35:30.796 --> 35:32.195
- It looks like Vecna.

35:32.264 --> 35:34.264

The crew that puts
smushing on the map

35:45.878 --> 35:48.145
definitely knows a
thing or two about sex.

35:48.213 --> 35:50.747
And thiseason, it was
all they could talk about.

35:50.816 --> 35:52.382
Let's take a look.

35:52.451 --> 35:53.950
- I'm not gonna sit there

Putting them teeth on.

36:20.345 --> 36:22.012
Got them floss.
Putting them teeth on.

36:22.080 --> 36:23.246

36:23.315 --> 36:25.549

weirdest [bleep] with women.

36:25.651 --> 36:26.783
- Then you go--

36:26.852 --> 36:27.784

36:32.124 --> 36:33.056

36:33.125 --> 36:34.257
- I--I--I mean.

36:34.326 --> 36:35.358
- Vinny has a weird issue.

- Wait.

36:39.831 --> 36:40.830
- If--If you do this--

36:40.899 --> 36:41.965
If you do this--

36:42.034 --> 36:43.867
- I don't have a gag reflex.

36:43.936 --> 36:44.901
- O-- OK, p--p--

36:44.970 --> 36:45.902
Princess.

36:45.971 --> 36:48.004
- J--J-- Just choke yourself.

36:48.073 --> 36:49.039
- No, no.

36:49.107 --> 36:50.540
No, in your mouth.

36:50.609 --> 36:52.642
Don't--D--D--Don't--
Don't do that right here.

36:52.711 --> 36:54.110
- I--I-- I want to make
out with a dolphin.

36:54.179 --> 36:55.779
D--D-- Dolphin.
There's a science.

36:55.847 --> 36:56.846
- Wait.
- There's a science.

36:56.915 --> 36:58.481
- Wait.
- You're all the worst.

36:58.550 --> 37:00.183
- I mean, you just
don't want to see

37:00.252 --> 37:01.952
this man's browser history.

37:02.020 --> 37:02.953
- Oh, my God.

37:03.021 --> 37:03.954
- Wow.

37:04.022 --> 37:04.955
- Oh, my God.

37:05.023 --> 37:06.089
- What the [bleep]?

37:06.158 --> 37:07.424
- Pauly, that's a
dope track to spin.

37:07.492 --> 37:08.425
Wow.

37:08.493 --> 37:09.459
That's fire.

37:09.528 --> 37:10.794
- I'm a mother of three.

37:10.862 --> 37:11.861
Delete that.

37:11.930 --> 37:13.163
Delete that.
- Please.

37:13.232 --> 37:14.264
- So, listen.

37:14.333 --> 37:15.799
Now, ladies, did
anyone try the gag

37:15.867 --> 37:17.234
reflex that Nicole showed you?

37:17.269 --> 37:18.602
- I tried.Itsnor

37:18.670 --> 37:19.836
- I didn't make it up.

37:19.905 --> 37:22.339
- I don't need it.

37:22.407 --> 37:24.307
- I didn't know Deena was
Little Miss No Gag Reflex.

37:24.376 --> 37:25.609
- Oh, my God.

37:25.677 --> 37:27.110
- So, Nicole, where did
you learn that from?

37:27.179 --> 37:28.111
- Honestly--

37:28.180 --> 37:29.412
- Yeah.

37:29.481 --> 37:30.814
- When me and Jenni
went to Double Shot,

37:30.882 --> 37:31.781
we were meeting all the girls.

37:31.850 --> 37:33.149
- Which ones?

37:33.218 --> 37:34.417
I wish I knew this information.
- All of them.

37:34.486 --> 37:35.685
All of them.

37:35.754 --> 37:37.520
- So now, Vin, you're
grossed out by flossing.

37:37.589 --> 37:38.521
- I hate it.

37:38.590 --> 37:39.856
- But [bleep] ass is OK.

37:39.925 --> 37:40.957
- 100%.

37:41.026 --> 37:43.360
- OK, so what if
your girl is a ten,

37:43.428 --> 37:44.561
but she flosses
in front of you?

37:44.630 --> 37:46.062
- Ooh.

37:46.131 --> 37:47.364
- Will you still [bleep]
the ass?

37:47.432 --> 37:48.698
- No, but what is she now?
- You know, I just think

37:48.767 --> 37:49.799
I just don't wanna see,
like, anybody's, like,

37:49.868 --> 37:50.800
old
food flying around the room.

37:50.869 --> 37:51.835
I don't know.

37:51.903 --> 37:53.236
Humans are weird like that.

37:53.338 --> 37:54.537
Like we won't share
a toothbrush,

37:54.606 --> 37:55.672
but we'll [bleep] ass.

37:55.741 --> 37:58.041
- Stop saying we.
[laughs]

37:58.110 --> 38:01.444
- I think that's a necessary
requirement for Vinny.

38:01.513 --> 38:03.713
- Listen, if I like somebody,
I will [bleep] that [bleep]

38:03.782 --> 38:04.714
for breakfast, literally.

38:04.783 --> 38:06.049
Only for breakfast.

38:06.118 --> 38:07.617
Not after they've been
walking around all day.

38:07.686 --> 38:09.452
I'm not disgusting.

38:09.521 --> 38:10.453
- I hate him.

38:10.522 --> 38:11.521
- He's like the worst.

38:11.590 --> 38:12.689
- He's on a roll today.

38:12.758 --> 38:13.690
All right.

38:13.759 --> 38:15.425
Angelina, this
season we learned

38:15.494 --> 38:17.294
your vagina has a nickname.

38:17.396 --> 38:18.495
Why Brenda?

38:18.563 --> 38:19.529
- I don't know.

38:19.598 --> 38:20.997
I always wanted
to name something

38:21.066 --> 38:22.565
that name, so I was like,
[bleep] it,

38:22.634 --> 38:23.833
name my vagina Brenda.

38:23.902 --> 38:25.435
- She didn't have enough cats.
- There it is.

38:25.504 --> 38:26.469
- Let's go.
- OK, Brenda.

38:26.538 --> 38:27.504
- Hot girl summer

38:27.572 --> 38:29.039
- So you give it,
like, the least

38:29.107 --> 38:30.006
sexiest name you can think of.
- What would you name it, Vin?

38:30.075 --> 38:31.007
- Brenda?
- Karen.

38:31.076 --> 38:32.642
- I like Brenda.
So '90s.

38:32.711 --> 38:33.810
- Brenda's hot.

38:33.879 --> 38:35.478
I think it fits
her vagina, though.

38:35.547 --> 38:36.813
- It fits my vagina.

38:36.882 --> 38:38.782
- What's the villain's
name in "Stranger Things"?

38:38.850 --> 38:41.117
- Vecna.
- Vecna

38:41.186 --> 38:42.118
- Damn.

38:42.187 --> 38:44.254
- It looks like Vecna.

38:44.323 --> 38:46.056
[laughter]
- That's a Vecna.

38:46.124 --> 38:47.390
- All right.

38:47.459 --> 38:49.726
This crew knows how to
keep it sex positive.

38:49.795 --> 38:52.028
Let's see how much more
they're willing to share it

38:52.097 --> 38:54.531
with a round of
never have I ever.

38:54.599 --> 38:56.066
Let's get the drinks.
- Hey.

38:56.134 --> 38:57.334
- Mike, we got some
water for you.

38:57.436 --> 38:58.635
- Finally.

38:58.704 --> 39:00.136
- I'm gonna read some
never have I evers.

39:00.205 --> 39:02.572
If you've done it,
you have to take a sip.

39:02.641 --> 39:03.907
- You're all getting divorced.

39:03.975 --> 39:04.941
- All right.

39:05.010 --> 39:06.776
Never have I ever
tied someone up.

39:06.845 --> 39:07.811
- No.

39:07.879 --> 39:08.945
- Shockingly, I haven't.

39:09.014 --> 39:11.314
- Has anyone here been tied up?

39:11.383 --> 39:14.084
A lady in the streets and
a freak in the sheets.

39:14.152 --> 39:15.919
- Not one of you
have been tied up?

39:15.987 --> 39:17.487
- I'm claustrophobic.
- Handcuffs count?

39:17.556 --> 39:18.521
- Yeah, I think so.
Yeah.

39:18.590 --> 39:20.123
- Oh, OK, I've done that.

39:20.192 --> 39:21.858
- I maybe tied up the missus.
Does that count?

39:21.927 --> 39:22.892
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

39:22.961 --> 39:23.960
That was the first one.

39:24.029 --> 39:25.295
- All right.

39:25.364 --> 39:28.631
Never have I ever had my
kids walk in mid smush.

39:28.700 --> 39:29.933
- Ugh.

39:30.001 --> 39:31.000
- Jesus.

39:31.069 --> 39:32.335
- It sounds, like, often.  .

39:32.404 --> 39:33.670
Wait.
Nicole, what was that like?

39:33.739 --> 39:35.138
- Mommy and Daddy
are wrestling.

39:35.207 --> 39:37.574
- Literally, like, Dad, what
are you doing on top of Mom?

39:37.642 --> 39:38.575
- Oh, [bleep].

39:38.643 --> 39:39.743
- No, it happens.

39:39.811 --> 39:41.211
It's never happen to you?
- Thank, God.

39:41.279 --> 39:42.212
- All right.

39:42.280 --> 39:44.748
Never have I ever
had a threesome.

39:44.816 --> 39:45.749
- Never in my life.

39:45.817 --> 39:47.016
- Oh, wait, V--

39:47.085 --> 39:48.385
Vinny, how long of a
sip are you taking?

39:48.453 --> 39:49.719
How many threesomes
have you had?

39:49.788 --> 39:50.887
- I'ma have to chug this
[bleep].

39:50.956 --> 39:52.756
- Oh, yeah.
- Not-- not while married,

39:52.824 --> 39:53.890
but--
- No, of course not.

39:53.959 --> 39:55.291
- Yeah, in my previous life.

39:55.360 --> 39:56.526
- Hell yeah, I'd
drink this whole cup.

39:56.595 --> 39:59.796
- Never have I ever
used a sex toy.

39:59.865 --> 40:00.997
- Angelina.

40:01.066 --> 40:02.565
- Ang, did you ever
use the butt plug?

40:02.634 --> 40:03.933
- No, I never used it.

40:04.002 --> 40:06.236
- There are so many
uncomfortable people

40:06.304 --> 40:07.637
behind the cameras.

40:07.706 --> 40:09.606
- We are all just too
comfortable with each other

40:09.674 --> 40:11.374
that we're like, wait,
you put it in your butt?

40:11.443 --> 40:12.475
- Thanks for coming, everyone.

40:12.544 --> 40:13.977
- Well, listen,
after that game,

40:14.045 --> 40:16.246
I feel like I know way too
much about everyone's sex life.

40:16.314 --> 40:17.313
- Drink to that.

40:17.382 --> 40:18.314
- So, yeah,
let's drink to that.

40:18.383 --> 40:19.315
Cheers.
Salud.

40:19.384 --> 40:20.450
- Salud.

40:20.519 --> 40:21.818
- Now, we made it
through the sex talk,

40:21.887 --> 40:24.320
but we couldn't blow our
whole load in the first hour.

40:24.389 --> 40:27.190
Did Nicole really not
know owls were real?

40:27.259 --> 40:28.491
I mean, who's gonna tell her?

40:28.560 --> 40:30.059
[together]
Hoo!

40:30.128 --> 40:32.462
- Has all the beef from San
Diego really been squashed?

40:32.531 --> 40:34.264
Plus, we've got
a surprise guest

40:34.332 --> 40:35.265
for the cast dropping by.

40:35.333 --> 40:36.266
- Oh, no.

40:36.334 --> 40:37.834
- All of that and
more on part two

40:37.903 --> 40:40.737
of the "Jersey Shore
Family Vacation Reunion."

40:40.806 --> 40:41.805
I'm Justina Valentine.

40:41.873 --> 40:42.806
Peace.

40:42.874 --> 40:45.575
[cheers and applause]

40:49.014 --> 40:50.346
- Everyone's allowed
to get intoxicated,

40:50.415 --> 40:51.981
Nicole, Deena,
but no one gives a [bleep].

40:52.050 --> 40:53.950
- Do not pull me into this,
bitch.

40:54.019 --> 40:55.285
- Vinny's just a lot
about Vinny.

40:55.353 --> 40:56.553
Wait, what?
- [laughs]

40:56.621 --> 40:58.288
- Angelina, is there a new man
in your life?

40:58.356 --> 40:59.422
- There's a few
that I'm dating,

40:59.491 --> 41:00.423
so he's one of them.

41:00.492 --> 41:01.724
- Ohh.
- You know what,

41:01.793 --> 41:02.892
you just can't play anymore.

41:02.961 --> 41:04.227
- What the [bleep]?

41:04.296 --> 41:06.129
- Are you leaving?
- Whoa.

41:06.198 --> 41:07.330
<i> - Wait, where is he going?</i>
