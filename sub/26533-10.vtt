00:05.701 --> 00:08.530
It's you.
You're the Shadow Demon?

00:09.096 --> 00:11.011
Welcome to the Sisters
of the Arcana.

00:12.099 --> 00:13.013
You were gonna kill me?

00:16.103 --> 00:17.060
LEON:
Tartarus.

00:17.104 --> 00:18.105
A hellish prison.

00:19.367 --> 00:21.021
Little brother,
you will pay for this.

00:21.064 --> 00:22.892
It's where the bad guys
send their bad guys.

00:22.935 --> 00:25.895
Parker, stop.The Portal to Tartarus!

00:28.115 --> 00:30.030
Oh, my God.

00:33.163 --> 00:36.775
Stay back!
I'm gonna kill her!

00:55.751 --> 00:57.144
Hey.

00:57.187 --> 00:59.015
You bloody thief.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.843
You've robbed
your last bank.

01:03.280 --> 01:04.281
Aah!

01:08.155 --> 01:10.809
DRAGON EYE: That's how
we break you in Tartarus.

01:10.853 --> 01:14.813
We torture you with the memories
that you most wish to forget.

01:14.857 --> 01:16.728
You're gonna have to do better
than a memory

01:16.772 --> 01:18.600
that's entirely fake.

01:19.644 --> 01:21.472
The more you resist,

01:21.516 --> 01:23.692
the harder
you'll fall.

01:33.397 --> 01:36.313
♪ I had a dream...

01:36.357 --> 01:38.228
The Book of Shadows
was useless.

01:38.272 --> 01:40.404
We've been through
every arcane and mystic text.

01:40.448 --> 01:42.145
Hunter basically
dragged Harry down

01:42.189 --> 01:43.146
into the Alcatraz
of the underworld.

01:43.190 --> 01:45.409
So, like Hell-catraz?

01:45.453 --> 01:47.107
Not funny, Macy.
Sorry.

01:47.150 --> 01:49.196
I don't deal well with stress.
What did the Elders say?

01:49.239 --> 01:51.937
That it is unfortunate
that you destroyed

01:51.981 --> 01:54.157
Marisol's piece
of the Scythe of Tartarus.

01:54.201 --> 01:55.289
The fact is,

01:55.332 --> 01:57.291
that scythe
is the only known method

01:57.334 --> 01:59.380
to extract someone
from Tartarus.

01:59.423 --> 02:01.469
The Elders don't have
any other ideas

02:01.512 --> 02:03.123
how to help
Harry, and...And what?

02:03.166 --> 02:08.128
And they are not
particularly interested

02:08.171 --> 02:10.130
in pursuing the matter further.

02:10.173 --> 02:11.696
Not for a Whitelighter.

02:11.740 --> 02:15.222
So they're just going to
leave Harry in Hell-catraz?

02:15.265 --> 02:17.659
It was Harry's choice
to become a Whitelighter;

02:17.702 --> 02:19.443
he was well aware of the risks.

02:19.487 --> 02:22.185
Remind me again how
the Elders are the good guys?

02:22.229 --> 02:24.187
You're okay with just giving up
and letting Harry rot?

02:24.231 --> 02:28.017
I am not giving up, I just...

02:28.060 --> 02:30.019
have no idea what to do.

02:30.062 --> 02:31.760
But I will keep
thinking, obviously.

02:31.803 --> 02:34.763
In the meantime, we need
you two to stay on mission.

02:34.806 --> 02:36.330
That means you, Mel,
get back to the Sarcana

02:36.373 --> 02:39.202
and find out
who is murdering Elders.

02:39.246 --> 02:40.725
Got it.

02:40.769 --> 02:42.945
Thank you.

02:42.988 --> 02:44.381
For you, Macy,

02:44.425 --> 02:46.644
that means figuring out
what is going on at the lab.

02:46.688 --> 02:49.952
As painful as the discovery
that Parker is a demon was

02:49.995 --> 02:51.954
for your sister,
it does reveal what's clearly

02:51.997 --> 02:53.738
a larger demonic plot

02:53.782 --> 02:55.044
connected to
Morningstar Biotech.

02:55.087 --> 02:56.263
Already on it.

02:56.306 --> 02:58.090
Check this out.

02:58.134 --> 03:00.092
It's a family operation.

03:00.136 --> 03:03.400
Dr. Julia Wagner
and Alistair Caine were married.

03:03.444 --> 03:05.185
She's Parker's mom.

03:05.228 --> 03:06.882
They're divorced now.

03:06.925 --> 03:09.189
But still in business together.

03:09.232 --> 03:11.103
Wonder if he pays
her Hell-imony.

03:12.409 --> 03:13.802
What? It's only okay
when you do it?

03:13.845 --> 03:16.370
He looks familiar.

03:16.413 --> 03:17.588
Huh.

03:17.632 --> 03:18.981
Nice work, Macy.

03:24.421 --> 03:26.815
Anything else
I should know about?

03:26.858 --> 03:29.078
Nope. Not that I can think of.

03:29.121 --> 03:31.733
Okay.

03:33.865 --> 03:37.304
What was that all about?It was Galvin.

03:37.347 --> 03:40.220
So what did he say?That he's back
and he's ready to talk.

03:40.263 --> 03:43.266
I'm hoping that's not cover
for burning me at the stake.

03:43.310 --> 03:45.703
Uh, we should continue
to not let Charity know

03:45.747 --> 03:47.705
he found out we're witches,
and that he's walking around

03:47.749 --> 03:49.316
with an un-wiped memory,

03:49.359 --> 03:51.535
thanks to our Whitelighter
being in Hell-catraz and all.

03:51.579 --> 03:55.235
Yeah. I'm starting to think that
we should make a habit of that.

03:55.278 --> 03:56.975
Keeping things
from Charity.

03:57.019 --> 03:58.499
I'm gonna go see the Sarcana.

03:58.542 --> 04:01.023
But not because I think
they killed Mom.

04:01.066 --> 04:02.938
They broke somebody
out of Tartarus.

04:02.981 --> 04:05.419
They might be
our only chance to save Harry.

04:12.556 --> 04:14.515
I'm heading out.

04:14.558 --> 04:16.908
Will you be all right?

04:18.954 --> 04:21.609
It's been a week.
I think I'm all cried out.

because my freaking powers

04:31.967 --> 04:34.230
couldn't figure out

04:45.763 --> 04:49.289
How am I supposed

04:51.334 --> 04:54.511
I don't want to feel
like this anymore.

04:54.555 --> 04:56.774
I don't want to feel anything.

04:56.818 --> 05:00.343
I know. But you have to.

05:00.387 --> 05:03.303
You can't push

05:03.346 --> 05:07.872
Trust me, only when I let myself

05:07.916 --> 05:09.178

So let me get this straight.

You're a witch,
and your sisters are witches,

06:22.382 --> 06:25.385
but not just any witches.
You're special.

06:25.428 --> 06:27.778
And you sent someone
to Hell-jail?

06:27.822 --> 06:30.390

person," went with him?

06:30.433 --> 06:32.435
Whitelighter.

technically correct.

06:34.481 --> 06:36.570

06:38.354 --> 06:40.704
You're not freaked out,
like, a little bit?

06:40.748 --> 06:42.706
Well, I mean, the thing
is, when I was growing up,

06:42.750 --> 06:45.013
my grandmewas always
talking about her religion.

06:45.056 --> 06:48.016
Yoruba this, Yoruba that.
Witches and demons.

06:48.059 --> 06:49.800
And she even said that she
did a special spell on me

06:49.844 --> 06:51.628
when I was a baby
to protect me from evil.

06:51.672 --> 06:54.544
She did.
You had a protection mark.

06:54.588 --> 06:56.372
What?

06:56.416 --> 06:58.940
I saw it on your side
when you started dating Summer.

06:58.983 --> 07:01.159
Remember?
It's a long story.

07:01.203 --> 07:03.423
I was worried it was demonic,
but it's gone now.

07:03.466 --> 07:06.034
The shape-shifter who was
pretending to be me at Christmas

07:06.077 --> 07:07.818
got rid of it
'cause it was stopping him

07:07.862 --> 07:09.080
from entering the house.

07:09.124 --> 07:11.474
Sure. Casual.

07:13.389 --> 07:15.870
I always thought my grandme
was just superstitious,

07:15.913 --> 07:18.307
but now that I look back on
it, there was a few things

07:18.350 --> 07:20.918
that happened I
couldn't explain.

07:20.962 --> 07:23.530
Speaking of which...

07:25.532 --> 07:27.577
...can you do it again?

07:35.672 --> 07:38.632
Yo, that is wild.

07:38.675 --> 07:41.635
No cap.

07:41.678 --> 07:43.724
Okay, okay. Sorry.

07:43.767 --> 07:45.421
I c-- I can, I can handle this.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.857
I can handle this.Really?

07:46.901 --> 07:49.207
Mm-hmm.
'Cause there is
one more thing.

07:49.251 --> 07:51.775
We are working for a demon.

07:57.955 --> 08:00.523
Aw, sweetheart.

08:02.482 --> 08:05.223
You're getting worse.

08:05.267 --> 08:07.225
I wish you had gotten
that amulet.

08:07.269 --> 08:09.010
I stand
by my decision, Mom.

08:09.053 --> 08:10.968
I'd rather die a half-human
than live as a demon.

08:11.012 --> 08:12.622
I understand.

08:12.666 --> 08:15.059
I just don't know
if I can save you without it.

08:15.103 --> 08:16.539
ALISTAIR:
Aw.

08:16.583 --> 08:19.281
Look what we have here.

08:19.324 --> 08:21.413
A touching mother-son moment.

08:21.457 --> 08:24.286
How revolting.What are you doing here,
Alistair?

08:24.329 --> 08:25.983
Have you heard
from your brother?

08:26.027 --> 08:27.332
He stole the amulet
and took off.

08:27.376 --> 08:28.420
He's not looking
to be found.

08:28.464 --> 08:30.597
A detail that still
makes no sense,

08:30.640 --> 08:32.250
no matter how many
times you say it.

08:32.294 --> 08:33.991
Alistair, leave him alone.

08:34.035 --> 08:35.558
He's not well, and
we had an agreement.

08:35.602 --> 08:38.169
You can't just show up here.
The laboratory's my domain.

08:38.213 --> 08:41.259
I don't remember you complaining
when I handed you this plum job.

08:41.303 --> 08:44.349
You really should be
thanking me.

08:44.393 --> 08:47.352
I want you

08:47.396 --> 08:50.399
to thank me.

08:53.489 --> 08:54.621
Thank...

09:02.019 --> 09:04.500
Our settlement has
very strict prohibitions

09:04.544 --> 09:05.806
against you mesmerizing me.

09:05.849 --> 09:08.373
I'm gonna find Hunter.

09:08.417 --> 09:11.289
We will see if he has
a different tale to tell.

09:18.427 --> 09:23.606
SARCANA: Shifa' on haza-aljesmo wa ruho.

09:23.650 --> 09:26.435
This is what happens
to people in Tartarus?

09:26.478 --> 09:29.438
They torture you down there,
destroy your hope.

09:29.481 --> 09:31.309
And you end up like this.

09:31.353 --> 09:32.702
And she's a witch?

09:32.746 --> 09:35.836
A very important one,
known as the Keeper

09:35.879 --> 09:37.620
of the Sacred Flame.

09:37.664 --> 09:40.362
Just like your Whitelighter,
she didn't belong in Tartarus.

09:40.405 --> 09:41.624
It's the worst
of the worst.

09:41.668 --> 09:46.107
It's Hellflame,
to power the incubator.

09:46.150 --> 09:49.632
But we don't have enough
to make her better.

09:49.676 --> 09:52.069
I'm sorry the Elders
are so heartless

09:52.113 --> 09:53.549
about saving your Whitelighter.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.507
Not that I'm surprised.

09:55.551 --> 09:57.858
They always have been
cold and out of touch.

09:57.901 --> 10:00.817
And in power for far too long.

10:00.861 --> 10:02.166
But all that's gonna change.

10:03.211 --> 10:04.647
What do you mean?

10:04.691 --> 10:06.736
Soon as we get more Hellflame,
you'll see.

10:06.780 --> 10:08.172
SARCANA: Shifa' on haza...

10:08.216 --> 10:11.393
I'm gonna help you
get your boy back.

10:11.436 --> 10:15.397
A demon named Dante guards
the nearest gateway to Tartarus.

10:15.440 --> 10:16.659
I can show you
where to find him,

10:16.703 --> 10:18.139
but you'll want
to act soon.

10:18.182 --> 10:20.358
If Tartarus is draining
his will to live,

10:20.402 --> 10:21.882
Harry will end up
like this.

10:23.405 --> 10:24.798
And you may never get him back.

10:40.509 --> 10:42.076
Another false memory?

10:42.119 --> 10:44.600
Come on!

10:44.644 --> 10:45.906
Do your worst.

10:50.258 --> 10:53.130
Watch it.Clear off.

10:53.174 --> 10:55.829
I said watch it,
pretty boy.

11:15.457 --> 11:17.285
DRAGON EYE:
Ah.

11:17.328 --> 11:22.159
Looks like those memories
are real after all, eh?

11:22.203 --> 11:25.815
Still think you're a hero,
Whitelighter?

11:30.951 --> 11:32.517
Jada said the Sarcana
didn't have anything

11:32.561 --> 11:35.695
worth trading with Dante,
but Tartarus is the prison

11:35.738 --> 11:37.044
for the worst of the worst.

11:37.087 --> 11:38.959
The demons other demons
hate and fear.

11:39.002 --> 11:42.310
And we've got one, right?
The Harbinger.

11:42.353 --> 11:44.878
He's got to be one of the ten
most wanted for that place.

11:44.921 --> 11:47.532
So you're saying we get
Harbie from the Elders

11:47.576 --> 11:48.882
to trade for Harry?

11:48.925 --> 11:49.926
Yeah, what do you think?

11:49.970 --> 11:51.188
You've had worse ideas before;

11:51.232 --> 11:52.494
I just can't
think of one right now.

11:52.537 --> 11:53.713
Maggie, what is up with you?

11:55.366 --> 11:56.716
Nothing.

11:56.759 --> 11:58.369
Your Harbie idea works.

11:58.413 --> 11:59.631
I got to go.PARKER: Maggie.

11:59.675 --> 12:00.763
Maggie, please.

12:00.807 --> 12:02.243
Go away.

12:02.286 --> 12:03.679
I never wanted
to hurt you.

12:03.723 --> 12:06.551
Look, you have
to believe me.
Don't touch me.

12:17.519 --> 12:19.042
Never hurt again.

12:43.501 --> 12:44.764
All clear.

12:55.862 --> 12:57.951
Need some help?

13:00.518 --> 13:02.259
GALVIN:
Damn.

13:10.877 --> 13:12.356
Hmm.

13:12.400 --> 13:13.923
Aw, man.

13:13.967 --> 13:15.751
Any chance you came
prepared for this?

13:15.795 --> 13:16.926
Have you met me?

13:16.970 --> 13:18.798
I keep a pair of sneakers
lying around

13:18.841 --> 13:20.756
in case a zombie apocalypse
breaks out while I'm at work.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.627
Of course I came prepared
for this.

13:25.195 --> 13:26.806
Revelate.

13:30.897 --> 13:32.724
Voilà.

13:35.379 --> 13:36.772
Hey, Galvin.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.818
Check out these gene sequences.

13:42.256 --> 13:43.257
I don't see any...

13:44.954 --> 13:48.436
Wait. The protein structures
are irregular.

13:48.479 --> 13:50.873
It's not...
Human.

13:50.917 --> 13:52.396
But these are.

13:52.440 --> 13:55.965
I think she's turning
human DNA into demon DNA.

14:00.013 --> 14:00.840
Come on, come on, come on.

14:05.366 --> 14:06.541
What the hell's going on?

14:06.584 --> 14:10.153
I'm so sorry.So unprofessional.

14:10.197 --> 14:13.026
It is. This is a genetics lab,
not a motel room.

14:13.069 --> 14:14.941
Get the hell out of my office.

14:14.984 --> 14:16.986
It'll never happen again.

14:22.513 --> 14:24.776
Got it.

14:24.820 --> 14:26.256
Yes!

14:27.562 --> 14:29.172
Mmm.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.875
Do you want to come
over to my place?

14:35.918 --> 14:38.965
You mean like stay over?

14:39.008 --> 14:41.010
Yeah, yes.

14:44.187 --> 14:46.494
Mm, there's something I should
probably tell you first.

14:48.539 --> 14:50.324
Oh, come on, it
can't be any bigger

14:50.367 --> 14:53.849
than telling me
you're a witch.
Yeah.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.069
Yeah, no,
you're right, um...

14:56.112 --> 14:57.897
I'm a virgin.

15:00.464 --> 15:01.813
Oh.

15:01.857 --> 15:03.511
MACY:
He had a better reaction

15:03.554 --> 15:06.340
when I told him we
work for a demon.

15:06.949 --> 15:08.951
He was basically speechless.

15:08.995 --> 15:11.171
And here I thought I was
so lucky to start something

15:11.214 --> 15:12.868
with someone
who accepted all of me.

15:14.391 --> 15:16.828
He was probably
just surprised.

15:16.872 --> 15:18.613
I know we were
when you told us.

15:18.656 --> 15:20.832
Back me up
on this, Maggie.

15:22.834 --> 15:24.401
Maggie.

15:24.445 --> 15:25.881
What is with you?

15:27.013 --> 15:28.753
Nothing. Never better.

15:28.797 --> 15:31.452
Seriously, you are
all over the place.

15:31.495 --> 15:33.454
Did you take one of Mom's
old benzos again?

15:33.497 --> 15:35.325
You must be out of
your charmed minds.

15:35.369 --> 15:37.501
I take it you got
my message.

15:37.545 --> 15:41.070
You want to give a warden of
Tartarus the Harbinger of Hell?

15:41.114 --> 15:43.507
If it's to get Harry back, yes.

15:43.551 --> 15:46.293
Do you remember how hard it was
to capture the Harbinger

15:46.336 --> 15:49.513
in the first place, and now
you want to give it to demons?

15:49.557 --> 15:51.733
Don't even get me started
about you talking

15:51.776 --> 15:53.474
to the Sarcana about Tartarus.

15:53.517 --> 15:55.345
It's not like
the Elders were helping.

15:55.389 --> 15:56.781
The Elders will never
allow this.

15:56.825 --> 15:58.435
We do not

15:58.479 --> 16:00.785
negotiate with demons.

16:00.829 --> 16:03.963
The Harbinger is a demon
that belongs in jail.

16:04.006 --> 16:05.573
We'd be taking it back
to where it belongs.

16:05.616 --> 16:08.968
And no one can open the can
since you enchanted it.

16:09.011 --> 16:11.622
We have to try. For Harry.

16:11.666 --> 16:13.929
If we don't get him out soon,
we might lose him.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.976
He could be changed forever.

16:17.019 --> 16:19.021
I don't care what
the Elders have to say.

16:19.065 --> 16:22.982
Do you realize
what you are asking me to do?

16:23.025 --> 16:25.897
Yes. We've been through this
with Angela.

16:25.941 --> 16:29.466
Harry is worth saving,
and I know you think so, too.

16:34.471 --> 16:36.256
Wow.

16:36.299 --> 16:39.476
I didn't think
she'd be this heartless.

16:49.878 --> 16:51.227
Let's go get Harry.

16:51.271 --> 16:53.969
DRAGON EYE:
You're not worth saving, Harry.

16:54.013 --> 16:57.407
You might as well just give in.

17:06.199 --> 17:07.156
Hello?

17:07.200 --> 17:09.158
Dropping off or picking up?

17:09.202 --> 17:12.640
Are you Dante?I know who you are.

17:13.902 --> 17:16.122
Charmed Ones.

17:16.165 --> 17:17.558
We need Harry Greenwood.

17:17.601 --> 17:19.125
And we can pay.

17:19.168 --> 17:21.910
I've come across a gaggle
of ladies just like you before.

17:21.953 --> 17:23.912
Tried to offer me a measly ankh

17:23.955 --> 17:25.522
and lodestone to get
someone out of Tartarus.

17:25.566 --> 17:28.003
What if I told you we had
the Harbinger of Hell?

17:28.047 --> 17:29.657
Look at that.

17:29.700 --> 17:33.095
The Harbinger of Hell neutered
in some dime-store paint can.

17:33.139 --> 17:35.358
I always wanted to get
my hands on that guy.

17:35.402 --> 17:36.577
Don't just stand there.

17:36.620 --> 17:38.840
Let me see it.Wait.
We need to be sure

17:38.883 --> 17:41.234
that Harry's still--
that he's okay.

17:48.284 --> 17:50.634
What is happening to him?

17:50.678 --> 17:52.027
MEL: Quick, how do we

17:52.071 --> 17:53.246
get him out?
With one of those?

17:53.289 --> 17:54.943
This ain't Club Fed
there, Charmed One.

17:54.986 --> 17:56.075
It takes a special
kind of man

17:56.118 --> 17:57.119
to break someone out
of Tartarus.

17:57.163 --> 17:58.990
Well, do it.
We don't have much time.

17:59.034 --> 18:00.383
Hold your horses
there, sweets.

18:00.427 --> 18:01.776
I don't buy the car
without kicking the tires

18:01.819 --> 18:04.518
once or twice;
it's just bad business.

18:15.311 --> 18:17.226
Is this a trick?

18:17.270 --> 18:18.793
You won't be able to open it.
It's enchanted.

18:20.142 --> 18:21.926
Wait, what?

18:21.970 --> 18:23.493
It's empty?

18:25.234 --> 18:28.368
No one swindles Dante
and gets away with it.

18:28.411 --> 18:31.153
Now you die.

18:32.676 --> 18:34.113
What do we do?

18:34.156 --> 18:35.636
We have to break
Harry out ourselves.

18:35.679 --> 18:37.116
How do we do that?

18:37.159 --> 18:38.204
MACY:
Get Dante to tell us how

18:38.247 --> 18:39.074
by reading his thoughts.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.250
Follow my lead.Sure.

18:41.294 --> 18:43.122
Maggie, seriously,
what is wrong with you?

18:43.165 --> 18:45.385
Okay, Mel, come on.
Unfreeze time.

18:45.428 --> 18:47.082
Okay.

18:50.346 --> 18:52.392
Go. Maggie, go.
Read his thoughts.

18:54.176 --> 18:56.178
Dante,
how do we release

18:56.222 --> 18:57.919
someone from Tartarus?

18:57.962 --> 18:59.181
Like I'd evertell you.

18:59.225 --> 19:00.487
MACY:
Keep holding on, Maggie.

19:00.530 --> 19:03.185
How do we release someone
from Tartarus?

19:03.229 --> 19:04.491
I'm not getting anything.

19:04.534 --> 19:05.535
What?

19:05.579 --> 19:08.059
I don't think
my powers are working.

19:11.193 --> 19:13.064
Maggie, what did you do?

19:13.108 --> 19:15.154
I'm sorry, I didn't want
to feel anymore.

19:23.074 --> 19:24.728
I'll make you sorry!

19:24.772 --> 19:26.382
MEL/MACY:
No!

19:28.471 --> 19:30.908
DANTE:
Whew!

19:34.521 --> 19:37.088
MAGGIE :
Help! Help!

19:37.132 --> 19:38.220
Maggie...

19:38.264 --> 19:41.092
Now, go get me the Harbinger,

19:41.136 --> 19:43.007
or you'll never see
your sister again.

19:43.051 --> 19:45.053
Go!

19:45.096 --> 19:47.621
CHARITY:
Mel, I swear to you,

19:47.664 --> 19:49.231
I did not give you
an empty vessel.

19:49.275 --> 19:51.929
Oh, come on, you obviously
didn't trust us

19:51.973 --> 19:53.757
with the real thing.That is not what happened.

19:53.801 --> 19:57.326
I figured out
what's wrong with Maggie.

19:57.370 --> 19:59.763
She took her pain away
with a spell.

20:03.158 --> 20:05.900
These are habit-forming
and have serious side effects.

20:05.943 --> 20:08.511
Like her powers not working?
Guess she didn't read

20:08.555 --> 20:09.860
the fine print.

20:09.904 --> 20:11.384
Her powers aren't working?MEL: Yes.

20:11.427 --> 20:13.951
And now she's stuck in Tartarus,
so we need to get her out.

20:13.995 --> 20:15.126
Where is the real Harbinger?

20:15.170 --> 20:16.432
Mel, I have no idea.

20:16.476 --> 20:18.869
This does not
make any sense.

20:18.913 --> 20:21.089
After the exorcism, that paint
can was in my possession

20:21.132 --> 20:22.133
at all times.

20:23.309 --> 20:25.354
Oh, no.

20:25.398 --> 20:26.964
What?

20:27.008 --> 20:30.054
Alistair Caine.
That's why he looked familiar.

20:30.098 --> 20:33.797
Would you mind switching
paint cans with me?

20:33.841 --> 20:35.103
Pleasure doing business
with you.

20:35.146 --> 20:36.452
He must have

20:36.496 --> 20:38.802
mesmerized me
and switched paint cans.

20:38.846 --> 20:43.503
No one has ever been able
to mesmerize me before.

20:43.546 --> 20:46.810
We are dealing with
a very powerful demon.

20:46.854 --> 20:48.682
Who now has the Harbinger.

20:48.725 --> 20:50.684
So what are we
supposed to do?

20:50.727 --> 20:53.948
We use our personal connection.

20:56.342 --> 20:59.997
Yes, my dad is
the demon Alastor.

21:00.041 --> 21:02.086
Also known as the Dark Master.

21:02.130 --> 21:05.046
Also known as the dick
who stole the Harbinger.

21:05.089 --> 21:06.439
I get it.
The demonic apple

21:06.482 --> 21:08.049
doesn't fall far
from the tree.

21:08.092 --> 21:09.572
We don't have time
for name-calling.

21:09.616 --> 21:11.270
Maggie's in trouble.

21:11.313 --> 21:13.359
Which is the only reason
I'd ever set foot

21:13.402 --> 21:16.187
in a frat house that smells of
stale beer and white privilege.

21:16.231 --> 21:17.885
You say you want to
help Maggie.

21:17.928 --> 21:19.103
I'll do anything.

21:19.147 --> 21:20.670
Tell us where
the Harbinger is.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.328
My dad has him.

21:26.372 --> 21:28.287
I've seen the paint can
in his study.

21:28.330 --> 21:30.245
Great. So, let's go
to his study.Okay.

21:30.289 --> 21:31.638
There's no way
you can get in there.

21:31.681 --> 21:33.204
I'll get it for you.

21:33.248 --> 21:34.771
No way,
we're getting it.You can't.

21:34.815 --> 21:35.816
Not without me.

21:35.859 --> 21:37.339
You expect us to trust you?

21:37.383 --> 21:40.168
What other choice do you have?

21:40.211 --> 21:42.170
You know what,
he's right.

21:42.213 --> 21:43.302
You saw what's happening
to Harry.

21:43.345 --> 21:44.738
Maggie's being tormented
down there, too,

21:44.781 --> 21:46.348
and as soon as that numbing
spell wears off,

21:46.392 --> 21:49.046
she's going to feel everything.

21:53.355 --> 21:54.530
You okay there, Cinderella?

21:54.574 --> 21:56.750
Can I take you out

21:56.793 --> 21:58.317
on a proper date?

21:58.360 --> 22:01.581
It's you.
You're the Shadow Demon?Let me explain.

22:03.060 --> 22:05.280
DRAGON EYE:
Scream all you want,
Charmed One.

22:05.324 --> 22:08.544
I'm under strict orders
to give you

22:08.588 --> 22:11.678
a hellof a hard time.

22:20.034 --> 22:23.298
Help me!

22:23.342 --> 22:26.867
I feel so lucky to be the mother
of two special

22:26.910 --> 22:29.304
young women.

22:29.348 --> 22:31.045
BOTH :
No!

22:31.088 --> 22:33.961
Mom, help me!

22:36.485 --> 22:38.269
Get me out of here!

22:38.313 --> 22:41.055
Anyone, please. Harry!

22:41.098 --> 22:42.839
Harry!Maggie?

22:42.883 --> 22:44.275
Harry?

22:44.319 --> 22:46.277
Maggie, is that you?Harry?

22:46.321 --> 22:48.889
Please, Harry,
I can't take it anymore.

22:48.932 --> 22:50.369
But you have to hold on.

22:50.412 --> 22:54.373
I-I can't.

22:54.416 --> 22:56.157
I'm so tired of all of it.

22:56.200 --> 22:59.073
I know, but you mustn't
give up hope.

22:59.116 --> 23:02.772
I did a spell to numb my pain,
and now it's all coming back.

23:02.816 --> 23:04.731
Oh, no, Maggie...

23:04.774 --> 23:06.341
Everything hurts too much.

23:06.385 --> 23:07.951
No, no, that's how
they break you, Maggie.

23:10.824 --> 23:13.392
Please...

23:13.435 --> 23:14.741
HARRY:
Listen to me.

23:14.784 --> 23:17.265
You have to fight it.

23:17.308 --> 23:19.354
Let love be your strength.

23:19.398 --> 23:23.010
I loved Parker.
All it did was hurt me.

23:23.053 --> 23:26.405
Then gain strength from me.

23:26.448 --> 23:28.842
And know you'll never be alone.

23:37.111 --> 23:39.418
Let me take her pain.

23:39.461 --> 23:40.897
Give me the memory instead!

23:40.941 --> 23:43.422
Come on, you overgrown lizard.

23:43.465 --> 23:45.598
Torture me. I dare you.

23:47.643 --> 23:51.473
Be careful what you ask for.

23:59.960 --> 24:02.441
DOCTOR: I'm sorry,
there's nothing more

24:02.484 --> 24:04.486
we can do to save your son.

24:07.446 --> 24:08.664
It's my fault.

24:08.708 --> 24:12.494
HARRY: No.

24:12.538 --> 24:14.235
MAGGIE:
Harry!

24:14.278 --> 24:16.193

24:17.630 --> 24:19.414

24:23.200 --> 24:25.115

24:25.159 --> 24:27.422
Yeah.

24:27.466 --> 24:29.511
Wait here.

24:29.555 --> 24:32.035

the surveillance off.

24:34.864 --> 24:37.040

25:16.689 --> 25:18.517

25:19.953 --> 25:21.563

25:21.607 --> 25:24.392

to Hunter.

25:30.006 --> 25:32.531
Looking for this?

to Hunter.

25:46.632 --> 25:49.156
Parker banished Hunter
to Tartarus

25:49.199 --> 25:51.550
because he's in love
with Maggie.

25:59.209 --> 26:00.733

Fine.

26:22.493 --> 26:26.062
You have something
that belongs to me.

26:33.504 --> 26:35.071
First of all, that is mine.

26:35.115 --> 26:37.857
Secondly, it's come to my
attention that my son, Hunter,

26:37.900 --> 26:38.858
is rotting in your prison.

26:38.901 --> 26:41.251
Parker sold us out.What?

26:41.295 --> 26:42.949
I don't just open the gate...Silence!

26:45.473 --> 26:47.606

insubordination later.

26:48.955 --> 26:53.481
Oh, where are my manners?

26:53.524 --> 26:57.746

Charmed, I'm sure.

26:57.790 --> 26:58.834

26:58.878 --> 27:01.054

27:08.017 --> 27:10.672

companies would consider that

27:10.716 --> 27:13.109
a "fireable" offense.

27:13.153 --> 27:17.113
But, luckily for you,
I'm just a big softie.

27:17.157 --> 27:19.855
If you think I'm going
to spend one more day

27:19.899 --> 27:22.423
working for you in that lab,
turning humans into demons...

27:22.466 --> 27:24.033
You are out of your mind.

27:24.077 --> 27:25.252
Oh, and you must be Mel,

27:25.295 --> 27:27.646

so much about.

27:27.689 --> 27:29.952
From your backstabbing
frat boy spawn?

27:29.996 --> 27:33.826
Is that any way to talk about
the love of your sister's life?

27:33.869 --> 27:36.698
Hey, Mags. I'm so sorry
about the breakup.

27:36.742 --> 27:38.178
Can we please kill him now?

27:38.221 --> 27:40.615
Oh, I would love
to see you try, empath.

27:41.834 --> 27:43.836

about a witch

27:43.879 --> 27:46.229

27:46.273 --> 27:48.667
That's right. Nothing.

Now, Dante,

27:52.018 --> 27:54.237
if you don't mind,

27:54.281 --> 27:57.763

No.

38:31.047 --> 38:33.920
I was looking through those
files we took from Dr. Julia,

38:33.963 --> 38:35.878
and I found this.

38:37.402 --> 38:39.360
She was sequencing your DNA.

38:39.404 --> 38:41.406
Your sisters', too.

38:45.410 --> 38:47.368
This can't be right.

38:47.412 --> 38:50.023
What? What is it?

38:50.066 --> 38:54.332
I'm the half sister.

38:54.375 --> 38:59.032
I only share a mother with Mel
and Maggie, but this says

38:59.075 --> 39:01.556
they share 23%
of their DNA,

39:01.600 --> 39:05.604
while Maggie
and I share 52.

39:05.647 --> 39:08.302
That's impossible.

39:08.346 --> 39:09.825
Unless...

39:09.869 --> 39:12.350
They don't share a father.

39:14.569 --> 39:17.137
Maggie and I do.
