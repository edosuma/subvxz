[theme music]

00:55.923 --> 00:56.724
Audio input read there.

01:01.129 --> 01:03.231
God, if my boss
calls me Doll one more

01:03.264 --> 01:05.266
time, I'm going to
deep fry his face.

01:05.299 --> 01:07.101
DAN: What's the matter, Honey,
did you have a tough day

01:07.135 --> 01:08.001
at the drive thru window?

01:08.035 --> 01:09.537
Yeah, I hate my boss.

01:09.570 --> 01:11.272
I hope he never graduates
from high school.

01:13.907 --> 01:15.276
You something to drink?

01:15.309 --> 01:17.345
Yeah, would you
like fries with that?

01:17.378 --> 01:18.579
No thanks, Doll.

01:18.612 --> 01:20.314
ROSEANNE:
[groans in frustrations]

01:20.348 --> 01:21.382
Eureka.

01:21.415 --> 01:22.783
Honey, how late is
the video store open?

01:22.816 --> 01:25.486
JACKIE: No, Dan wait
now, I have to show you.

01:25.519 --> 01:29.990
Now, the timer is preset, so
you just put the tape in there.

01:30.023 --> 01:34.528
Push that thing there, and
that will record my soaps.

01:34.562 --> 01:36.063
I think I can handle it.

01:36.096 --> 01:37.198
You're going to
record my soaps?

01:37.231 --> 01:38.266
No problem.

01:38.299 --> 01:39.567
Right, because a
lot of critical stuff

01:39.600 --> 01:41.435
could happen while I'm away
at police training school.

01:41.469 --> 01:43.171
DAN: Soap opera--
all them people

01:43.204 --> 01:44.772
do is get pregnant and die.

01:44.805 --> 01:46.707
That's cuz it's
based on real life.

01:46.740 --> 01:48.442
Which is why I never watch'em.

01:48.476 --> 01:49.643
(SHOUTING) Dinner!

01:49.677 --> 01:52.446
Now, look you guys
have your family.

01:52.480 --> 01:55.549
The people at Bay Gardens
Medical Center are my family.

01:55.583 --> 01:57.585
My god, she's addicted.

01:57.618 --> 02:03.023
Besides, it looks like Elisa
may be institutionalized.

02:03.056 --> 02:04.792
Awesome, it's here.

02:04.825 --> 02:06.126
Are we going to
rent some movies?

02:06.160 --> 02:08.696
Let's rent Lethal Weapon
Two, Jaws Three, and Nightmare

02:08.729 --> 02:10.264
on Elm Street Four.

02:10.298 --> 02:11.699
Yeah, well, you better
go wash your hands

02:11.732 --> 02:16.704
or I'm gonna make you guys
watch Dr. Zhivago again.

02:16.737 --> 02:18.739
You wanna help me set
up the table, Sis?

02:18.772 --> 02:19.807
I can't stay for dinner.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.141
Why not?

02:21.175 --> 02:24.412
I got six weeks worth of
stuff to get to before tomorrow.

02:24.445 --> 02:25.613
Well, you got to eat.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.281
Yeah, but I can pick up
something on the way home.

02:27.315 --> 02:29.750
I haven't even packed yet,
and my apartment's a mess.

02:29.783 --> 02:31.151
Well, why don't
you eat with us,

02:31.185 --> 02:32.753
and then, I'll come home
with you and help you.

02:32.786 --> 02:34.054
No, you've been
working all day.

02:34.087 --> 02:35.556
You're tired.

02:35.589 --> 02:37.258
ROSEANNE: I'm not tired.

02:37.291 --> 02:38.959
You know, I can help
you get organized.

02:38.992 --> 02:41.094
Did-- did you make a list of
the stuff you need to take?

02:41.128 --> 02:43.364
Roseanne, I just
need to be by myself.

02:43.397 --> 02:46.667
Oh, you mean, like, alone?
I remember that.

02:46.700 --> 02:48.369
That's what I was
before you were born.

02:51.305 --> 02:52.973
Maybe I'll come
by later tonight.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.442
ROSEANNE: What time?

02:54.475 --> 02:55.776
I don't know.

02:55.809 --> 02:57.678
ROSEANNE: Well, do you want
me to save you something?

02:57.711 --> 02:59.847
Yeah, save me my soaps.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.081
I'll see ya later.

03:01.114 --> 03:01.915
ROSEANNE: Bye.

03:08.956 --> 03:11.058
Hey, it's your night
to do the dishes.

03:11.091 --> 03:11.959
No it's not.

03:11.992 --> 03:13.193
It's Becky's night.

03:13.227 --> 03:15.263
Do'em anyway.

03:15.296 --> 03:17.365
Well, why do I
have to do them?

03:17.398 --> 03:19.533
Because Becky is getting
ready to go to a party.

03:19.567 --> 03:21.369
Well, why can't I go
to some stupid party?

03:21.402 --> 03:24.238
Because you're going
to do the stupid dishes.

03:24.272 --> 03:26.106
That's why I don't
get invited to parties,

03:26.139 --> 03:29.443
because I have dish pan hands.

03:29.477 --> 03:31.745
Well, you're only 13
Honey, did you think

03:31.779 --> 03:34.448
your looks would last forever?

03:34.482 --> 03:36.850
BECKY (VOICEOVER):
Mom, earrings?

03:36.884 --> 03:38.118
Oh, yeah.

03:38.151 --> 03:40.454
Hey, before you put
that stuff away, make up

03:40.488 --> 03:42.022
a plate for Aunt Jackie.

03:42.055 --> 03:44.224
What, are we
doing take out now?

03:44.258 --> 03:45.759
She's coming over later.

03:45.793 --> 03:47.361
What do you think,
Deej, David Crockett

03:47.395 --> 03:48.596
and the Riverboat Pirates?

03:48.629 --> 03:51.064
Dirty Harry.

03:51.098 --> 03:54.968
So tell me Punk,
how lucky do you feel?

03:55.002 --> 03:57.438
DJ: Very lucky.

03:57.471 --> 04:00.474
What do you say we
split the difference?

04:00.508 --> 04:02.009
How about Star Wars?

04:02.042 --> 04:03.377
Great.

04:03.411 --> 04:04.778
All right, go get your coat.

04:04.812 --> 04:07.948
Honey, Lammikins, you want to
go to the video store with us?

04:07.981 --> 04:08.916
Nah.

04:08.949 --> 04:10.418
Mom, we're getting Star Wars.

04:10.451 --> 04:13.186
Oh, I'm gonna stay here
in case Jackie comes over,

04:13.220 --> 04:15.723
but may the force be with you.

04:15.756 --> 04:17.525
Hell, you are the force.

04:17.558 --> 04:18.459
Ain't that the truth?

04:25.232 --> 04:28.836
You know, we may be needing
those dishes again tomorrow.

04:28.869 --> 04:30.771
Here, I'll wash, you dry.

04:30.804 --> 04:31.705
DARLENE: Great.

04:31.739 --> 04:32.740
ROSEANNE: Where you going?

04:32.773 --> 04:34.007
Oh, just stack'em
up over there.

04:34.041 --> 04:35.175
I'll dry them later.

04:35.208 --> 04:36.744
Darlene, I have
made dinner for you

04:36.777 --> 04:37.945
every night of your life.

04:37.978 --> 04:40.881
Is it too much I ask
you to do the dishes?

04:40.914 --> 04:41.815
No, it's not.

04:41.849 --> 04:42.716
I'm sorry.

04:42.750 --> 04:43.584
I'll do them.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.419
You can go.

04:45.453 --> 04:49.957
Oh, that's all right, I feel
like scalding my hands anyway.

04:49.990 --> 04:50.791
You're excused.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.265
This is a cool top.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.333
I hate that top.

04:59.367 --> 05:01.268
I look like I'm 14.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.671
You are 14.

05:03.704 --> 05:05.339
I know, but I don't
have to look like it.

05:08.376 --> 05:10.611
Hey, that looks great on you.

05:10.644 --> 05:11.512
Really?

05:11.545 --> 05:12.946
I was just playing closet.

05:12.980 --> 05:13.981
Well, it looks good.

05:14.014 --> 05:15.182
JACKIE:

05:15.215 --> 05:16.684
DARLENE: Don't worry,
I'm not going to keep it.

05:16.717 --> 05:17.585
No, it's OK, wear it.

05:17.618 --> 05:19.353
Wait a sec.

05:19.387 --> 05:20.253
Ouch.

05:20.287 --> 05:21.589
BECKY: Sorry.

05:21.622 --> 05:22.423
OK, one more thing.

05:31.298 --> 05:34.134
OK, do this.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.704
Shake your head a little bit.

05:36.737 --> 05:37.771
And go like this.

05:43.811 --> 05:45.479
You need makeup.

05:45.513 --> 05:47.180
Oh, please.

05:47.214 --> 05:50.183
I'm serious, Darlene, you can
be really pretty if you tried.

05:50.217 --> 05:52.620
Look at yourself.

05:52.653 --> 05:55.188
Do we have to go to
your party with Diane?

05:55.222 --> 05:56.724
Diane isn't going.

05:56.757 --> 05:59.793
I'm going by myself, unless
you want to come with me?

05:59.827 --> 06:00.994
Yeah, right.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.563
BECKY: I'm serious.

06:02.596 --> 06:04.364
DARLENE: I'd be the only
one there in junior high.

06:04.398 --> 06:05.699
Nobody has to know that.

06:05.733 --> 06:07.568
Well, they're going to know
it, because none of the kids

06:07.601 --> 06:08.569
are going to know me.

06:08.602 --> 06:10.137
We'll say you
go to St. Mary's.

06:10.170 --> 06:11.505
No way.

06:11.539 --> 06:16.243
All the girls at St. Mary's
have mustaches and thick calves.

06:16.276 --> 06:18.412
OK, we'll say you're
my cousin from Chicago.

06:18.446 --> 06:22.215
Yeah, your rich
cousin from Chicago.

06:22.249 --> 06:23.350
Yeah.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.352
Yeah.

06:25.385 --> 06:29.122
Say my name is Vivian.

06:29.156 --> 06:31.959
DAN: Honey, I got six
weeks worth of cinematic

06:31.992 --> 06:34.294
extravaganzas right here
in my hot little hands,

06:34.327 --> 06:35.596
each and every one a classic.

06:35.629 --> 06:39.032
Yeah, I'll bet.

06:39.066 --> 06:40.634
These are all cop movies.

06:40.668 --> 06:42.636
I don't want to be
reminded of cops.

06:42.670 --> 06:43.804
What's the difference?

06:43.837 --> 06:45.606
Love stories, cop stories,
someone gets chased,

06:45.639 --> 06:47.741
someone gets caught, a
woman screams, the end.

06:50.678 --> 06:53.447
ROSEANNE: Well, I don't want
DJ seeing nothing too graphic.

06:53.481 --> 06:55.415
Oh, I got you covered Babe.

06:55.449 --> 06:57.350
How do you feel
about Davy Crockett?

06:57.384 --> 06:59.086
I don't know Dan,
he killed himself

06:59.119 --> 07:01.755
a bar when he's only three.

07:01.789 --> 07:05.459
Let's watch that now.

07:05.493 --> 07:08.996
What did you get for
us for, like, later?

07:09.029 --> 07:10.430
DAN: [makes a funny noise]

07:10.464 --> 07:12.800
That's perfect.

07:12.833 --> 07:16.504
I can't work this damn thing.

07:16.537 --> 07:18.606
Where'd you get that language?

07:18.639 --> 07:21.241
This isn't a thing, it's a VCR.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.010
[phone rings]

07:24.978 --> 07:26.279
Hello and thank
you for calling

07:26.313 --> 07:30.050
the Conor Family Cineplex,
located at 714 Delaware Street.

07:30.083 --> 07:32.853
Yeah, yeah, yes, I'll tell her.

07:32.886 --> 07:34.254
OK, goodbye.

07:34.287 --> 07:35.155
Who was it?

07:35.188 --> 07:37.424
That was your sister, Lobocop.

07:37.457 --> 07:38.726
She's not coming over tonight.

07:38.759 --> 07:40.794
ROSEANNE: Well, why didn't
you let me talk to her?

07:40.828 --> 07:41.895
DAN: She was in a hurry.

07:41.929 --> 07:43.096
ROSEANNE: Well, I
wanna talk to her.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.064
Is she home?

07:44.097 --> 07:45.332
I don't know,
what's the problem,

07:45.365 --> 07:47.134
anyway-- you haven't seen
her for two and 1/2 hours?

07:47.167 --> 07:49.570
Well, she's leaving
for six weeks.

07:49.603 --> 07:53.340
And I am beside
myself about it.

07:53.373 --> 07:55.643
Well, I'm gonna miss her Dan.

07:55.676 --> 07:56.944
I miss her already.

07:56.977 --> 07:59.079
We've never been
apart that long.

07:59.112 --> 08:00.180
You'll see her
tomorrow when we

08:00.213 --> 08:02.816
drive her to the bus station.

08:02.850 --> 08:04.084
Well, you'd think
she'd want to spend

08:04.117 --> 08:06.319
her last night with her family.

08:06.353 --> 08:09.557
Don't forget Babe, the people
at Bay Gardens Medical Center

08:09.590 --> 08:12.259
are her family.

08:12.292 --> 08:13.794
Ladies and
Gentlemen, presenting

08:13.827 --> 08:15.495
my cousin Vivian from Chicago.

08:15.529 --> 08:16.830
DAN: Ooooh.

08:16.864 --> 08:22.770
Hi, Vivian, would you like
to finish drying our dishes?

08:22.803 --> 08:24.304
It was really my night
to do the dishes, Mom.

08:24.337 --> 08:25.438
I'll do them when I get back.

08:25.472 --> 08:27.440
You know, Vivian,
you're very beautiful.

08:27.474 --> 08:31.979
And yet, you remind
me of someone.

08:32.012 --> 08:33.781
I'm taking Darlene
to Lynn Boyd's party.

08:33.814 --> 08:34.915
You can't take
her to that party.

08:34.948 --> 08:36.516
There'll be boys there.

08:36.550 --> 08:40.320
There are boys at school,
and you let me go there.

08:40.353 --> 08:41.288
Dad?

08:41.321 --> 08:42.355
Yes?

08:42.389 --> 08:45.693
You said you're going
to give me a ride?

08:45.726 --> 08:46.860
I'd love to.

08:46.894 --> 08:48.428
I'm going with Daddy.

08:48.461 --> 08:50.664
Don't you want to stay here
with me and watch some movies?

08:50.698 --> 08:52.766
I wanna go for a ride.

08:52.800 --> 08:53.901
You wanna come with us Honey?

08:53.934 --> 08:58.205
Nuh, I'll stay here
in case Jackie calls.

08:58.238 --> 08:59.940
Ah, keep an eye on your sister.

08:59.973 --> 09:01.174
I will.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.375
ROSEANNE: You guys
be home by 8:00.

09:04.978 --> 09:05.779
All right, 11.

09:13.386 --> 09:14.254
Who you calling?

09:14.287 --> 09:16.924
It's after 11 o'clock.

09:16.957 --> 09:18.525
Why do you think I'm
calling somebody for?

09:18.558 --> 09:19.559
You got a phone in your hand.

09:19.593 --> 09:21.394
No I don't.

09:21.428 --> 09:23.864
You were calling
Jackie, weren't you?

09:23.897 --> 09:26.800
Oh, thanks for reminding me.

09:26.834 --> 09:29.870
Probably out, running around,
celebrating her last night out

09:29.903 --> 09:32.740
before boot camp.

09:32.773 --> 09:35.976
Yeah, we gotta drive her
to the bus at nine tomorrow.

09:36.009 --> 09:38.478
She's going to have a
hell of a time getting up.

09:38.511 --> 09:40.547
And knowing Jackie, she's
not even packed yet.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.950
Why don't you go pack for her?

09:42.983 --> 09:45.052
Nuh-huh, I'm not
going no place till

09:45.085 --> 09:46.954
Becky and Darlene get home.

09:46.987 --> 09:48.856
Yeah, and how about the
trouble in Johannesburg?

09:48.889 --> 09:50.123
Why don't you go try
to straighten out

09:50.157 --> 09:52.693
the South African government
while you're at it.

09:52.726 --> 09:55.729
Well, I would if you were
to fix those nuclear warheads

09:55.763 --> 09:58.131
like I told you to.

09:58.165 --> 09:59.466
[door close]

10:00.467 --> 10:01.601
They're baaaack.

10:01.635 --> 10:03.036
ROSEANNE: Cut it out.
DAN: Come on.

10:03.070 --> 10:03.837
Get in here.

10:08.842 --> 10:09.643
Mom?

10:13.346 --> 10:15.215
Did you guys have fun?

10:15.248 --> 10:16.549
It was OK.

10:16.583 --> 10:18.919
Becky, spent the whole night
sucking face with some guy.

10:21.755 --> 10:22.555
Goodnight.

10:26.827 --> 10:27.828
I guess Darlene
didn't get any.

10:38.405 --> 10:40.473
Here's your stinky
vest, hot lips.

10:40.507 --> 10:42.009
BECKY: What is your problem?

10:42.042 --> 10:44.644
My stomach, I'm nauseated.

10:44.678 --> 10:46.680
BECKY: I don't even know why I
took you to that party anyway.

10:46.714 --> 10:48.148
You're still just a little kid.

10:48.181 --> 10:49.549
Yeah, well, I'm
not the one who

10:49.582 --> 10:53.020
let Jimmy Mell treat her in a
lip lock for two and 1/2 hours.

10:53.053 --> 10:55.655
Darlene, what I do
is my own business?

10:55.689 --> 10:58.658
How about when you do in
front of 27 other people?

10:58.692 --> 11:02.162
It was practically dark, and
everyone else was making out.

11:02.195 --> 11:04.397
Nobody cares anyway,
Darlene, so just grow up.

11:04.431 --> 11:06.834
Everybody was
staring at you guys.

11:06.867 --> 11:08.702
BECKY: No, you
were staring at us.

11:08.736 --> 11:11.404
I can't believe you were
kissing him all night.

11:11.438 --> 11:14.241
BECKY: He was kissing me too.

11:14.274 --> 11:16.076
Well, most of the time.

11:16.109 --> 11:17.778
The rest of the time
I was kissing him.

11:17.811 --> 11:19.412
You look like those
people in National Enquirer

11:19.446 --> 11:20.814
who are joined at the head.

11:23.817 --> 11:26.286
Darlene, you can't just
sit there and be kissed.

11:26.319 --> 11:28.355
You gotta kiss back.

11:28.388 --> 11:29.890
Or you can be the one
doing the kissing,

11:29.923 --> 11:31.058
but boys don't like that.

11:31.091 --> 11:31.959
How come?

11:31.992 --> 11:33.160
I don't know.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.528
It's like they think it's
their job or something.

11:35.562 --> 11:36.864
Well, how do you
know when to breathe?

11:36.897 --> 11:38.331
You can breathe
whenever you feel like it.

11:38.365 --> 11:39.632
So basically,
you just do this?

11:44.271 --> 11:46.173
No, no, no, no,
no, you kind of--

11:52.780 --> 11:54.314
then you open your
mouth a little bit.

11:54.347 --> 11:57.484
You open your mouth?

11:57.517 --> 11:59.987
For what?

12:00.020 --> 12:02.389
So you can slip'em the tongue.

12:05.993 --> 12:07.394
I'm gagging!

12:14.935 --> 12:16.436
Hi Mom.

12:16.469 --> 12:20.941
Heeey, I heard you went
into thermal nuclear meltdown

12:20.974 --> 12:22.742
with some guy.

12:22.776 --> 12:24.544
It wasn't just some guy.

12:24.577 --> 12:27.714
It wasn't two guys, was it?

12:27.747 --> 12:30.483
No, it was Jimmy.

12:30.517 --> 12:34.521
You actually touched tongues?

12:34.554 --> 12:39.426
Yeah, bet you can't wait
for high school now, huh?

12:39.459 --> 12:44.364
If any guy puts his tongue
in my mouth, I'll barf.

12:44.397 --> 12:48.001
Great way to
get a second date.

12:48.035 --> 12:50.370
Come here and sit down.

12:50.403 --> 12:53.240
Uh-oh, here comes the talk.

12:53.273 --> 12:57.144
Well, kissing guys
ain't all that bad.

12:57.177 --> 12:59.980
In fact, it's kind of
fun, isn't it Becky?

13:00.013 --> 13:02.682
Mother?

13:02.715 --> 13:04.584
Just so long as it's
what you want to do,

13:04.617 --> 13:08.188
and you're not doing it to
act cool or nothing like that.

13:08.221 --> 13:09.589
BECKY: When you first
went out with Daddy,

13:09.622 --> 13:11.591
did you want to kiss
him all the time?

13:11.624 --> 13:14.995
Well, somebody had to do it.

13:15.028 --> 13:18.966
And you know me,
work, work, work.

13:18.999 --> 13:20.433
When did you know
that you wanted to spend

13:20.467 --> 13:21.668
the rest of your life with him?

13:21.701 --> 13:24.604
Oh, well, I ain't
decided that yet.

13:24.637 --> 13:26.306
We're just gonna raise you kids.

13:26.339 --> 13:28.341
You know, and then, if we
still like kissing each other,

13:28.375 --> 13:30.243
then we'll decide.

13:30.277 --> 13:31.979
Well, I kissed
Mark Winstead once,

13:32.012 --> 13:33.780
and I didn't have
to open my mouth.

13:33.813 --> 13:36.583
You kissed a guy,
and you didn't tell me?

13:36.616 --> 13:38.685
DARLENE: We beat
the Pirates, 14-zip.

13:38.718 --> 13:41.354
He saved my shutout,
so I kissed him.

13:41.388 --> 13:44.224
Well, that's how
it starts Darlene.

13:44.257 --> 13:45.859
Before you know it,
you're on love's

13:45.893 --> 13:48.428
old, emotional roller coaster.

13:48.461 --> 13:51.831
But all that is still while
off for you yet, I hope.

13:51.865 --> 13:53.266
Don't be too sure, Mom.

13:53.300 --> 13:55.402
Warren Marshall asked for
Darlene's phone number.

13:58.738 --> 14:00.407
DARLENE: Goodnight, Mom.
- Night, kiddo.

14:00.440 --> 14:03.276
Night, Beck.
BECKY: Night, Dar.

14:03.310 --> 14:04.177
Keep your mouth closed.

14:14.721 --> 14:17.891
Warren Marshall,
which one is he?

14:17.925 --> 14:19.026
He's the one we call Mandingo.

14:29.069 --> 14:31.104
Sis, you're gonna sneak
over to the barracks

14:31.138 --> 14:34.574
and visit me at the Academy?
- I don't think so.

14:39.212 --> 14:41.214
Well, I guess we
better get going then.

14:41.248 --> 14:42.049
Yeah, OK.

14:49.789 --> 14:52.159
Sis?

14:52.192 --> 14:53.626
You OK?

14:53.660 --> 14:55.695
ROSEANNE: Not really.

14:55.728 --> 14:57.564
It's only gonna
be for six weeks.

14:57.597 --> 14:59.432
Plus three days
of orientation.

14:59.466 --> 15:02.235
I'll be back
before you know it.

15:02.269 --> 15:04.204
Well, are you going to
take your stamps with you?

15:04.237 --> 15:05.939
What for?

15:05.973 --> 15:09.509
No, Roseanne, I'm
gonna be in training.

15:09.542 --> 15:12.145
You know, I'll probably be
too tired to lift a pen.

15:12.179 --> 15:13.813
But you can write me.

15:13.846 --> 15:15.515
You write great letters.

15:15.548 --> 15:17.150
You've probably already
written one, huh?

15:21.521 --> 15:22.322
Roseanne?

15:28.528 --> 15:30.397
Well, don't read it now.

15:30.430 --> 15:31.331
Why not?

15:48.915 --> 15:55.288
(WEEPY) Oh, Ro--
that was so sweet.

15:58.558 --> 16:00.027
Well, I wanted
to say something.

16:00.060 --> 16:00.860
I know.

16:03.997 --> 16:06.633
You're leaving,
Darlene's leaving.

16:06.666 --> 16:10.103
Where's Darlene going?

16:10.137 --> 16:11.771
Well, she went to
a party last night.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.140
(WEEPY) Oh!

16:19.479 --> 16:21.481
Well, she's growing up.

16:26.253 --> 16:29.556
Jackie, you're my best friend.

16:29.589 --> 16:32.225
Oh, Roseanne, don't get sappy.

16:32.259 --> 16:36.196
Well, I wanna get sappy, and
I want you to let me get sappy.

16:36.229 --> 16:37.597
OK, sap away.

16:40.933 --> 16:42.135
You're going away forever.

16:42.169 --> 16:43.703
No, I'm not.

16:43.736 --> 16:46.273
I'm going to be back
before you know it.

16:46.306 --> 16:49.476
Yeah, but you're
going to be different.

16:49.509 --> 16:52.345
But maybe, I'll be better.

16:52.379 --> 16:55.582
But I like you the
way you are now, even

16:55.615 --> 16:56.583
though you don't have any rugs.

17:05.192 --> 17:07.094
Oh, all right.

17:07.127 --> 17:09.028
Let's get going, or
you'll miss your bus.

17:13.266 --> 17:16.836
My truck's out
parked in the front.

17:16.869 --> 17:20.407
Some stupid cop probably
gave me a parking ticket.

17:20.440 --> 17:21.241
Oh, sorry.

17:23.876 --> 17:26.879
I can get the bags if
you'll grab this stuff.

17:26.913 --> 17:28.448
Yeah, I'm just going
to check your stove.

17:28.481 --> 17:29.682
It's off.

17:29.716 --> 17:33.586
I never cook, remember?

17:33.620 --> 17:35.488
[bittersweet music playing]

17:51.571 --> 17:52.439
(WEEPY) Oh.

17:58.044 --> 18:02.849
Oh well, she's a big girl now.

18:10.657 --> 18:12.091
Where you guys going?

18:12.125 --> 18:13.160
BECKY: To the mall.

18:13.193 --> 18:14.060
What for?

18:14.093 --> 18:15.895
BECKY: The usual.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.397
Well, when will you be back?

18:17.430 --> 18:19.232
When we're out of money.

18:19.266 --> 18:20.467
You want me to
run you down there?

18:20.500 --> 18:22.669
DARLENE: Nah,
we'll take the bus.

18:22.702 --> 18:25.172
Mom, I'm going over to Joey's!

18:25.205 --> 18:26.173
What for?

18:26.206 --> 18:28.475
To play!

18:28.508 --> 18:31.077
ROSEANNE: Oh, OK,
be home for dinner.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.313
I will.

18:33.346 --> 18:34.947
You need anything
from Budget Club?

18:34.981 --> 18:37.350
No.

18:37.384 --> 18:38.751
See you later.

18:41.754 --> 18:42.955
What's the matter?

18:42.989 --> 18:45.792
Nothing, just go.

18:45.825 --> 18:46.993
What?

18:47.026 --> 18:48.995
Nothing is wrong Dan, just go.

18:51.864 --> 18:53.132
[vacuum goes silent]

18:54.334 --> 18:56.169
Is this how you're
going to be until Jackie

18:56.203 --> 18:57.404
comes marching home?

18:57.437 --> 18:59.239
This doesn't have
anything to do with Jackie.

18:59.272 --> 19:00.573
The hell it doesn't.

19:00.607 --> 19:01.741
Well, that's too bad.

19:01.774 --> 19:02.642
Yeah, it's too bad.

19:02.675 --> 19:05.077
It is too bad, Roseanne.

19:05.111 --> 19:06.779
It's too bad you
can't accept the fact

19:06.813 --> 19:10.149
that people have to
live their own lives.

19:10.183 --> 19:11.751
Just because a bird
leaves a nest doesn't mean

19:11.784 --> 19:14.821
it's going to get
creamed by the Concord.

19:14.854 --> 19:16.756
Well, thanks, Dan.

19:16.789 --> 19:19.158
Thanks putting that
into perspective.

19:19.192 --> 19:21.494
Honey, six weeks isn't
that long of a time.

19:21.528 --> 19:23.463
It's almost a ninth of a year.

19:23.496 --> 19:27.200
My god, you've done the math.

19:27.234 --> 19:28.468
Well, she's my little sister.

19:28.501 --> 19:31.070
Well, your little sister
is all grown up now.

19:31.103 --> 19:34.073
I know everybody's
growing up and leaving me.

19:34.106 --> 19:36.108
Excuse me, did
you say everybody?

19:36.142 --> 19:38.478
Yeah, Jackie is off to
become a police woman.

19:38.511 --> 19:40.280
Darlene is practically dating.

19:40.313 --> 19:43.483
And Becky is going to
be married at this rate.

19:43.516 --> 19:44.984
And DJ is getting
his grownup teeth.

19:45.017 --> 19:47.587
Hey, this didn't have
anything to do with Jackie

19:47.620 --> 19:49.289
or Darlene or Becky or DJ.

19:49.322 --> 19:51.224
This has to do with Roseanne.

19:51.258 --> 19:52.859
You're afraid you're
going to be left alone.

19:52.892 --> 19:53.926
Well, I am.

19:53.960 --> 19:56.229
What about me?

19:56.263 --> 19:58.097
I'm the guy that's been
standing in line all these years

19:58.130 --> 20:00.400
waiting to get you by myself.

20:00.433 --> 20:02.201
What do you think that boat
I'm building in the garage

20:02.235 --> 20:03.470
only sleeps two?

20:03.503 --> 20:06.339
Because the
garage is too small.

20:06.373 --> 20:07.740
Come on, Honey, cheer up.

20:07.774 --> 20:09.175
I'm here, and I'll be
here forever and ever.

20:11.944 --> 20:14.547
Gee, Dan, are you trying
to make me feel worse?

20:14.581 --> 20:18.117
Forever, and ever,
and ever, and ever--

20:18.150 --> 20:19.085
ROSEANNE: What are you doing?

20:19.118 --> 20:20.287
-- and ever.

20:20.320 --> 20:25.425
Come on, you got me and
(SINGING) Baby, I got you.

20:25.458 --> 20:27.026
Oh, Dan, don't.

20:27.059 --> 20:29.829
(SINGING) I got
you to walk with me.

20:29.862 --> 20:32.532
I got you to talk with me.
(REGULAR VOICE) Come on,

20:32.565 --> 20:33.566
Honey, one verse?

20:33.600 --> 20:34.801
(SINGING) I got you to--

20:34.834 --> 20:36.536
-- (SINGING IN
UNISON) kiss goodnight.

20:36.569 --> 20:39.972
I got you to hold me tight.

20:40.006 --> 20:43.042
I got you, and I won't let go.

20:43.075 --> 20:47.514
I got you to love me so.

20:47.547 --> 20:52.485
I gooooot you Babe.

21:01.794 --> 21:04.331
Dear Sis, how are you?

21:04.364 --> 21:06.333
That's original.

21:06.366 --> 21:09.536
Dear Sis, I hope you survived
your first week of training

21:09.569 --> 21:13.406
and that life in the barracks
is, at the very least, coed.

21:13.440 --> 21:16.443
Things on the homefront
are as thrilling as ever.

21:16.476 --> 21:17.844
I told Mom you've been
working real late,

21:17.877 --> 21:20.079
and that's why you
haven't called her.

21:20.112 --> 21:23.215
You're gonna have to tell her,
hopefully, when I'm not there.

21:23.249 --> 21:24.617
Your place is fine.

21:24.651 --> 21:25.952
I've got your mail,
and I borrowed

21:25.985 --> 21:27.954
her Lillian Vernon catalog.

21:27.987 --> 21:31.891
Your plant is still
alive, pretty much,

21:31.924 --> 21:34.427
and will probably make it till
you get back. (SARCASTICALLY)

21:34.461 --> 21:36.429
Ah-ha.

21:36.463 --> 21:39.065
I hope I do.

21:39.098 --> 21:44.303
