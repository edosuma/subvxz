00:05.573 --> 00:07.206
Woman:

<i>gentlemen, as we start</i>

00:07.208 --> 00:08.407
<i>Our final descent</i>

00:08.409 --> 00:10.309
<i>Please make sure</i>
<i>your tray tables</i>

00:10.311 --> 00:12.644
And seat backs and are in
their full, upright position.

00:12.646 --> 00:14.246
Make sure your seat belts

00:14.248 --> 00:16.148
Are securely fastened,
and all carry-on luggage

00:16.150 --> 00:17.649
Is stowed underneath the seat
in front of you

00:17.651 --> 00:18.784
Or in the overhead bins.

00:18.786 --> 00:22.254
(intercom chimes)

00:22.256 --> 00:23.589
You have a good flight?

00:23.591 --> 00:26.125
You have any idea
how gorgeous you are?

00:26.127 --> 00:27.259
Not interested.
Thanks.

00:27.261 --> 00:29.495
You smell good, too.

00:29.497 --> 00:30.796
You know, I dreamt about
you the whole flight.

00:30.798 --> 00:32.631
X-rated.
Is that your best line?

00:32.633 --> 00:35.601
I thought chicks flying
to vegas were ready to party.

00:35.603 --> 00:37.636
Sir, I'm gonna need you
to take your seat.

00:37.638 --> 00:39.204
Yeah, I'm gonna
need another one

00:39.206 --> 00:40.339
Of those
free drinks, though.

00:40.341 --> 00:42.574
Sorry, sweetie.
Bar's closed.

00:42.576 --> 00:45.144
Oh, wow, it's really
not my night.

00:45.146 --> 00:46.145
(scoffs)

00:46.147 --> 00:47.379
Psst!

00:47.381 --> 00:49.348
Maybe you're not coming on
strong enough.

00:49.350 --> 00:51.817
(laughter)
(intercom dings)

00:51.819 --> 00:53.619
Man:
This is your captain speaking.

00:53.621 --> 00:55.254
We've just been cleared
to land in las vegas,

00:55.256 --> 00:56.822
Where the local time is 10:42

00:56.824 --> 00:58.557
And the temperature is
a pleasant 84 degrees.

00:58.559 --> 01:01.360
Cabin crew, please take
your seats for landing.

01:05.799 --> 01:07.433
Woman:
On behalf of pan transit

01:07.435 --> 01:08.534
And the entire flight crew,

01:08.536 --> 01:10.135
I'd like to thank you
for joining us

01:10.137 --> 01:12.371
And we look forward to seeing
you again in the future.

01:12.373 --> 01:13.439
Have a great night.
A little help?

01:13.441 --> 01:14.807
And good luck!
Which bag is yours?

01:14.809 --> 01:18.744
The yellow one. Thank you.

01:19.712 --> 01:20.746
Hey, look, I-I didn't mean

01:20.748 --> 01:22.247
To come off like a creep before.

01:22.249 --> 01:23.649
I was just trying
to have a good time.

01:23.651 --> 01:25.217
Buy you a drink to apologize?

01:25.219 --> 01:27.719
I don't think so.
Bottle of champagne?

01:27.721 --> 01:29.488
Cut me some slack, baby! Damn!

01:31.157 --> 01:32.624
Hey, what the hell?

01:33.827 --> 01:35.327
Hey, my watch--
where the hell's my watch?

01:35.329 --> 01:36.462
It was in my bag.

01:36.464 --> 01:38.464
Hey, hey! Hold on!
Hold on, all right?

01:38.466 --> 01:39.832
Ain't nobody leaving this plane.

01:39.834 --> 01:41.467
I've been robbed.
Stewardess!

01:41.469 --> 01:43.202
Don't let anybody
off this plane!

01:43.204 --> 01:44.703
Hey, wait, hold on a second.

01:44.705 --> 01:47.206
You-you probably left it in
the bar at the, uh, airport...

01:47.208 --> 01:48.807
Ain't nobody got no time
for your jokes, man, okay?

01:48.809 --> 01:50.209
I'm gonna need some help
finding my watch.

01:50.211 --> 01:51.477
Somebody stole my watch!
Man: Hey, hey, hey!

01:51.479 --> 01:53.145
What?
My wallet's gone, okay?

01:53.147 --> 01:54.146
Somebody stole my wallet.

01:54.148 --> 01:55.347
(passengers clamoring)

01:55.349 --> 01:57.516
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Somebody definitely

01:57.518 --> 01:59.351
Went through my bag!
Who went through my bag?

01:59.353 --> 02:00.619
They stealing on this plane!
Hey!

02:00.621 --> 02:02.788
Come on!
(passengers clamoring)

02:02.790 --> 02:05.157
Come on, damn it!
Hey, hey! Get back, man!

02:05.159 --> 02:06.391
What the hell's
wrong with you, man?

02:06.393 --> 02:08.694
(passengers clamoring)

02:13.833 --> 02:15.501
You know...

02:15.503 --> 02:19.771
That makes me just want to jump
on the next plane out of here.

02:19.773 --> 02:21.240
Doesn't matter where.

02:21.242 --> 02:22.374
Excitement of the unknown.

02:22.376 --> 02:23.909
No, sara, I got big plans.

02:23.911 --> 02:26.478
Really?
Yeah, morocco.

02:26.480 --> 02:29.248
You gonna open a bar
in casablanca, nick?

02:29.250 --> 02:30.382
Call me rick.
(laughs)

02:30.384 --> 02:32.417
I think that was
his name, wasn't it?

02:32.419 --> 02:34.486
(sidle laughs)

02:40.760 --> 02:43.328
Phillips: Caucasian female,
early 30s.

02:46.432 --> 02:48.534
Blunt force trauma
to the head.

02:48.536 --> 02:52.304
(camera shutter clicking)

02:53.439 --> 02:55.807
Stokes: Well, looks like
she started out on the road.

02:55.809 --> 02:56.909
Skidded through the dirt and...

02:56.911 --> 02:59.344
She came to rest right here.

02:59.346 --> 03:01.213
Long way to roll.

03:01.215 --> 03:02.915
She hit the road
with significant velocity.

03:02.917 --> 03:05.184
It would explain
he road rash...

03:08.421 --> 03:10.689
...And the broken neck.

03:14.561 --> 03:15.928
She's dressed for a good time.

03:15.930 --> 03:17.462
I don't think she found it.

03:18.731 --> 03:20.632
Sara?

03:23.670 --> 03:26.371
"janet riggins,
pan transit flight 111."

03:26.373 --> 03:27.839
Originated in newark.

03:27.841 --> 03:29.341
Layover in atlanta.

03:29.343 --> 03:31.310
Landed here at 10:45 tonight.

03:31.312 --> 03:33.545
Well, that's got
to be some kind of record.

03:33.547 --> 03:35.614
Dead in under an hour.

03:36.883 --> 03:38.951
Welcome to las vegas.

03:46.693 --> 03:49.528
â™ª who... Are you?

03:49.530 --> 03:52.598
â™ª who, who, who, who?

03:52.600 --> 03:55.767
â™ª who... Are you?

03:55.769 --> 03:57.269
â™ª who, who, who, who?

03:57.271 --> 03:59.538
â™ª I really wanna know

03:59.540 --> 04:02.241
â™ª who... Are you?

04:02.243 --> 04:03.809
â™ª oh-oh-oh
â™ª <i>who...</i> â™ª

04:03.811 --> 04:07.846
â™ª come on, tell me who are you,
you, you â™ª

04:07.848 --> 04:10.949
â™ª are you!

04:15.355 --> 04:18.023
(clamoring)

04:18.025 --> 04:20.325
Everyone, please,
everyone, listen up.

04:20.327 --> 04:20.726
Please, everyone.
Hey, hey!

04:20.728 --> 04:23.695
Look, my credit cards
are in my wallet.

04:23.697 --> 04:25.297
My driver's license.

04:25.299 --> 04:26.999
How am I supposed to check
into my hotel, huh?

04:27.001 --> 04:28.600
I understand, sir.
Woman:
That pendant was irreplaceable.

04:28.602 --> 04:29.868
Irreplaceable!

04:29.870 --> 04:32.471
My mother gave it to me.

04:32.473 --> 04:33.672
My dead mother.

04:33.674 --> 04:34.906
Now, we want to help you.

04:34.908 --> 04:36.541
But we need your cooperation.

04:36.543 --> 04:39.411
Okay? Police officers are gonna
be taking your statements.

04:39.413 --> 04:41.680
And after that,
you're free to go.

04:41.682 --> 04:43.815
It's a family heirloom.
Do you understand that?

04:43.817 --> 04:44.883
Where am I supposed
to sleep tonight, huh?
Yeah!

04:44.885 --> 04:46.351
All right, look, the airlines,

04:46.353 --> 04:48.487
The airlines are gonna
help those of you

04:48.489 --> 04:49.621
Who have to make connections.

04:49.623 --> 04:50.622
And when they can't,
they're gonna

04:50.624 --> 04:52.691
Offer you hotel vouchers.

04:52.693 --> 04:54.359
At the cheapest hotel
you can find.

04:54.361 --> 04:55.394
But first,

04:55.396 --> 04:57.329
Csi finlay and I

04:57.331 --> 04:59.731
Need your help to do our job.

04:59.733 --> 05:00.866
Do you remember

05:00.868 --> 05:02.868
A woman who was seated

05:02.870 --> 05:05.504
In row three, seat d.

05:05.506 --> 05:08.874
The seating plan in my head,
and do your job for you.

05:08.876 --> 05:10.575
Anybody sit in row two,

05:10.577 --> 05:12.811
Three or four?

05:14.013 --> 05:16.381
Okay, some of you men
might've remembered her.

05:16.383 --> 05:18.583
She had long blonde hair,

05:18.585 --> 05:22.854
Yeah, yeah, the blonde with the
ass in the tight, white dress.

05:22.856 --> 05:24.890
Why? Did she steal
my wallet, huh?

05:24.892 --> 05:26.391
I was sitting right behind her.

05:26.393 --> 05:28.927
She was acting very suspicious.

05:28.929 --> 05:32.597
The woman
that we are talking about

05:32.599 --> 05:34.800
Was just found dead.

05:34.802 --> 05:36.902
(all clamoring)

05:36.904 --> 05:38.737
So that makes this

05:38.739 --> 05:40.339
A homicide investigation.

05:40.341 --> 05:44.042
Are the last people
to see her alive.

05:44.044 --> 05:45.544
Him!

05:45.546 --> 05:46.645
He was harassing her.

05:46.647 --> 05:47.813
She wanted nothing
to do with him.

05:47.815 --> 05:48.947
I was just talking to the lady.

05:48.949 --> 05:50.515
Hater.

05:50.517 --> 05:53.085
Could you tell me
how you got the black eye?

05:53.087 --> 05:54.753
Yeah, yeah.

05:54.755 --> 05:56.521
He-he didn't have that
on the plane, man.

05:56.523 --> 05:58.824
Hey, you need to mind
your damn business.
Yeah, right.

05:58.826 --> 06:00.092
My watch was in my carry-on

06:00.094 --> 06:01.426
In the overhead bin.

06:01.428 --> 06:02.861
When I realized
it had been stolen...

06:02.863 --> 06:05.364
No one is leaving this plane!
I want to get by here...

06:05.366 --> 06:07.566
Relax, okay?
Somebody stole my watch!

06:07.568 --> 06:09.568
Let me get by!

06:09.570 --> 06:11.737
<i>I hit my head when I fell.</i>
<i>Old guy, he fights dirty.</i>

06:11.739 --> 06:14.906
<i>When I looked up, I saw</i>
<i>the blonde pushing her way out.</i>

06:14.908 --> 06:17.442
And that was
the last time I saw her.

06:17.444 --> 06:19.544
Can anyone else confirm
that story?

06:19.546 --> 06:20.979
Yeah, the old guy had
some fight left in him.

06:20.981 --> 06:24.683
All I know is the blonde
wanted off the plane.

06:24.685 --> 06:25.984
Am I right? Right?

06:25.986 --> 06:27.986
We all saw that.

06:27.988 --> 06:29.821
(passengers clamoring)

06:32.625 --> 06:34.159
The airline confirms

06:34.161 --> 06:36.728
Janet riggins' flight
landed on time.

06:36.730 --> 06:37.863
Gate f24.

06:37.865 --> 06:39.464
F gate means she had to take

06:39.466 --> 06:40.932
The tram to baggage claim,

06:40.934 --> 06:43.435
Pick up her checked bags.

06:43.437 --> 06:44.836
Well, she ended up here.

06:44.838 --> 06:46.571
She had to have
left the airport.

06:46.573 --> 06:47.906
Road leads
directly there.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.808
Yeah, but there's
a big convention in town.

06:49.810 --> 06:51.610
Long lines for taxis,
rental cars,

06:51.612 --> 06:52.744
Shuttle buses.

06:52.746 --> 06:53.779
She'd still be waiting in line.

06:53.781 --> 06:54.880
She could've walked.

06:54.882 --> 06:56.648
Right, maybe in your shoes.

06:56.650 --> 06:57.749
But not in those heels.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.484
(chuckles)

06:59.486 --> 07:01.753
So... Somebody
picked her up

07:01.755 --> 07:03.588
And gave her one hell of a ride.

07:04.791 --> 07:06.425
(screams)

07:06.427 --> 07:07.592
(car tires screeching)

07:11.831 --> 07:13.165
I think she left

07:13.167 --> 07:14.900
The vehicle at this swerve mark.

07:14.902 --> 07:15.901
Right here.

07:15.903 --> 07:17.035
Sidle:
Distance from there

07:17.037 --> 07:18.170
To where she came to rest

07:18.172 --> 07:20.472
Is 75 feet, so...

07:20.474 --> 07:22.507
30 is the constant,
multiplied

07:22.509 --> 07:24.176
By 75 feet,

07:24.178 --> 07:25.510
Times the coefficient
of friction

07:25.512 --> 07:27.012
For sliding...

07:27.014 --> 07:28.180
On this terrain,
I'd give it a...

07:28.182 --> 07:29.181
A one.

07:29.183 --> 07:30.449
One? Lucky guess.

07:30.451 --> 07:32.951
2,250 feet.

07:32.953 --> 07:36.121
Square root of that.

07:36.123 --> 07:39.124
Vehicle was traveling
about 45 miles an hour.

07:39.126 --> 07:40.926
You physics majors, you're...

07:40.928 --> 07:42.661
You're show-offs.

07:44.730 --> 07:46.598
So the driver
never hit the brakes.

07:46.600 --> 07:48.767
This was no accident.

07:48.769 --> 07:50.769
And either she jumped out
or was thrown out.

07:50.771 --> 07:52.904
Her luggage could
still be in the car.

07:52.906 --> 07:55.640
If we're lucky, maybe the driver
threw it out with her.

07:56.776 --> 07:57.843
Nick, down!

07:58.778 --> 08:01.746
Laser...
Pointed right at your chest.

08:01.748 --> 08:04.015
You see anything?

08:06.586 --> 08:07.853
There. Right there.

08:11.824 --> 08:13.925
Hey! Las vegas police.

08:15.895 --> 08:17.762
No, no, no!

08:17.764 --> 08:20.232
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I got him, I got him,
get this other guy!

08:20.234 --> 08:22.667
Stay down! Keep your hands where
I can see them! Don't move!

08:25.204 --> 08:27.105
What are you doing?

08:28.841 --> 08:31.710
(laughing)

08:31.712 --> 08:32.911
(grunts)

08:34.847 --> 08:35.847
What the hell are you doing?!

08:35.849 --> 08:37.582
Watching some planes, man.

08:37.584 --> 08:38.850
Huh?

08:38.852 --> 08:40.719
Don't point that thing at me!

08:40.721 --> 08:42.220
Chill! All right?

08:42.222 --> 08:43.955
We're just having a little fun.

08:43.957 --> 08:45.223
Hey, I got the other one!

08:45.225 --> 08:46.992
You know
that flashing pilots

08:46.994 --> 08:48.960
With your little laser's
a felony?

08:48.962 --> 08:51.196
You're interfering
with federal air operations.

08:53.733 --> 08:56.067
There was a murder
out here tonight.

08:57.136 --> 08:58.670
Did you and your buddy
see anything?

09:00.006 --> 09:01.606
(scoffs)

09:01.608 --> 09:02.807
We'll find out.

09:06.879 --> 09:08.079
(camera shutter clicks)

09:31.804 --> 09:33.838
I hear you and nick collared
a couple of would-be

09:33.840 --> 09:35.740
Terrorists tonight.
Yeah.

09:35.742 --> 09:37.309
Yeah, nick threatened to bring
the fbi down on them

09:37.311 --> 09:39.778
Unless they turn over
their laser pointers.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.279
And then he called
their parents.

09:41.281 --> 09:44.049
Who, I'm sure,
are very proud.

09:44.051 --> 09:45.817
So, where are we
with our victim?

09:45.819 --> 09:48.320
Well, mr. Scare 'em
straight and I found

09:48.322 --> 09:50.855
The victim's carry-on bag down
the road from the crime scene.

09:50.857 --> 09:53.692
There's not much to go on,
but she is a local.

09:53.694 --> 09:55.727
Found a nevada license.

09:58.130 --> 10:01.132
"janet riggins.

10:01.134 --> 10:02.300
1432 desert vista."

10:02.302 --> 10:04.369
I'll have brass look at this.

10:11.243 --> 10:13.612
Can I see your license
for a second?

10:14.814 --> 10:16.848
Sure.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.154
Look at your photo.

10:23.156 --> 10:24.789
Uh-huh, when it's backlit,

10:24.791 --> 10:27.092
You can see the perforated
outline of nevada.

10:27.094 --> 10:29.094
Right.

10:29.096 --> 10:30.629
Janet's...

10:32.632 --> 10:33.865
...Not so much.

10:33.867 --> 10:34.933
So...

10:34.935 --> 10:38.036
Why does ms. Riggins
need a fake I.D.?

10:39.305 --> 10:40.672
Brass: Here's some
video surveillance

10:40.674 --> 10:42.307
From outside
the baggage claim.

10:42.309 --> 10:44.376
That's the victim, right?
Janet riggins?

10:44.378 --> 10:46.878
If that's even
her real name, yeah.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.713
Sure is looking over
her shoulder a lot.

10:48.715 --> 10:52.717
Leaving baggage claim
with no checked bags?

10:52.719 --> 10:54.219
She didn't stick around
to claim 'em.

10:54.221 --> 10:57.055
And the reason she didn't
stick around is...

10:58.391 --> 10:59.758
...Kenny greene.

10:59.760 --> 11:00.925
He was a passenger
on her flight.

11:00.927 --> 11:01.993
He had his
watch stolen.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.228
He told me
the last time

11:03.230 --> 11:04.763
He saw our victim
was on the plane.

11:04.765 --> 11:05.864
That's a lie.

11:05.866 --> 11:09.668
When I met him,
he had a fresh black eye.

11:09.670 --> 11:11.136
He told me
that he got it

11:11.138 --> 11:12.404
When a fellow passenger

11:12.406 --> 11:14.739
Banged his head on an armrest.

11:14.741 --> 11:17.142
Then we should
see it right here.

11:17.144 --> 11:19.144
You think she gave it to him?

11:19.146 --> 11:20.445
I like to keep things simple
in the beginning.

11:20.447 --> 11:22.080
He ended up
with a shiner;

11:22.082 --> 11:23.948
She ended up dead.

11:28.154 --> 11:29.954
(exhales)

11:31.824 --> 11:32.924
My man!

11:32.926 --> 11:35.060
Any luck with that watch?

11:35.062 --> 11:37.328
Wow, the party never stops
for you, does it?

11:38.764 --> 11:40.065
Have you slept since the
last time I talked to you?

11:40.067 --> 11:41.232
You ever been to
combustion junction?

11:41.234 --> 11:43.168
(chuckles)
my lap is still achin'.

11:43.170 --> 11:44.703
It's open 24/7.

11:47.106 --> 11:49.774
You want to tell me again
about that black eye?

11:50.876 --> 11:52.210
Okay. Busted.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.279
I didn't get it
on the plane.

11:54.281 --> 11:55.747
No, you got it when
you beat up janet riggins.

11:55.749 --> 11:57.449
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

11:57.451 --> 11:58.750
Then how'd she
end up dead?

11:58.752 --> 12:00.218
I ran into the blonde
at baggage claim.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.853
Look, I just figured
it was the vegas gods

12:01.855 --> 12:03.221
Giving me another
crack at it.
I bet you're

12:03.223 --> 12:04.856
Really tight with all
the vegas deities.

12:04.858 --> 12:06.791
You know, me?
I'm tight with father time.

12:06.793 --> 12:08.793
You know,
like time code.

12:08.795 --> 12:11.229
See, the time this
picture was taken

12:11.231 --> 12:12.831
And the time you
showed up at the gate...

12:12.833 --> 12:14.933
That was two hours
of free time.
She was hot, man!

12:14.935 --> 12:16.201
I was looking to score.

12:16.203 --> 12:17.402
You can't arrest
a guy for trying.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.104
But when she saw me,
she ran.

12:19.106 --> 12:21.005
And that's when I knew
she stole my watch.

12:21.007 --> 12:22.407
Only the guilty run.

12:24.143 --> 12:26.111
Hey, babe?
Yeah.

12:26.113 --> 12:28.379
You got something
that belongs to me.

12:28.381 --> 12:30.248
You want your phone,
give me back my watch.

12:31.517 --> 12:33.017
Hey, that's assault!

12:33.019 --> 12:35.220
Look, I didn't
see that coming.

12:35.222 --> 12:38.256
But that was the last
time I saw her.

12:38.258 --> 12:40.058
I spent the rest
of my "free time"

12:40.060 --> 12:42.327
At the airport bar,
waiting on you guys
to show up.

12:42.329 --> 12:44.529
Hey, if you don't believe me,
just ask the bartender.

12:44.531 --> 12:46.164
She gave me her number.

12:46.166 --> 12:47.532
Let's say
I believe you, okay?

12:47.534 --> 12:49.334
Do you still have janet
riggins' cell phone?

12:52.371 --> 12:53.371
Oh...

12:53.373 --> 12:54.973
You stole her phone?

12:54.975 --> 12:56.141
Oh, no, no, no.
No, no.

12:56.143 --> 12:57.375
I was bargaining.

12:57.377 --> 12:58.376
I'm bargaining, too.

12:58.378 --> 13:00.145
So what do I get
if I charge you

13:00.147 --> 13:03.014
With robbery and
strong-arm assault?

13:04.416 --> 13:06.151
I can't catch a break.

13:15.060 --> 13:16.161
Stokes:
Hey.

13:16.163 --> 13:18.997
Any luck
I.D.'ing my victim?

13:18.999 --> 13:20.265
Well, she's got
a burner phone.

13:20.267 --> 13:21.866
You can get
one of those

13:21.868 --> 13:23.401
At any corner store
or gas station.
Yeah.

13:23.403 --> 13:27.472
She sure is going to a lot
of trouble to stay anonymous.

13:27.474 --> 13:29.440
Well, if I were to pull
a mid-air caper,

13:29.442 --> 13:31.442
I'd fly under
an alias, too.

13:31.444 --> 13:34.245
She's got
a vegas number.

13:34.247 --> 13:35.446
Chances are
she bought it local.

13:36.549 --> 13:38.316
(chuckles)

13:38.318 --> 13:40.952
Disregarding all the calls
her drunken assailant made

13:40.954 --> 13:42.320
To various call girls

13:42.322 --> 13:43.955
And phone sex
operators last night...

13:43.957 --> 13:45.023
Nice.

13:45.925 --> 13:47.859
Hodges:
...Got one text,

13:47.861 --> 13:49.294
Outgoing
at 10:48 p.M.

13:49.296 --> 13:50.461
To a local number.

13:51.297 --> 13:53.398
"landed."

13:57.069 --> 13:58.069
No registered owner.

13:58.071 --> 13:59.470
Another burner.

13:59.472 --> 14:01.940
I'll get an ag waiver
for the detail records.

14:01.942 --> 14:03.608
Maybe she texted
her ride.

14:03.610 --> 14:05.877
Or a getaway driver.
Mmm.

14:06.612 --> 14:08.613
Also, she made
one phone call,

14:08.615 --> 14:10.081
13 minutes later,
at 11:01,

14:10.083 --> 14:11.382
To a different
local number.

14:16.355 --> 14:18.356
Nalley janitorial
services.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.425
North
las vegas.

14:21.493 --> 14:24.429
Maybe she needed someone
to clean up her mess.

14:32.571 --> 14:34.239
Jefferson nalley?

14:34.241 --> 14:36.908
Yeah, uh... You must be
the guys that called.

14:37.910 --> 14:39.177
Yeah, I'm
nick stokes.

14:39.179 --> 14:40.311
This is
sara sidle.

14:40.313 --> 14:42.513
Need you to take
a look at a photo,

14:42.515 --> 14:43.514
If you don't mind.

14:43.516 --> 14:44.616
That's all?

14:44.618 --> 14:45.650
Yeah. Sure.

14:45.652 --> 14:47.218
Know this woman?

14:47.220 --> 14:48.920
No, no, never seen

14:48.922 --> 14:50.388
Her before.
Sara: Then why'd she
call you last night,

14:50.390 --> 14:52.290
Right before
she was murdered?

14:54.193 --> 14:55.994
Want to take
another look?

15:01.333 --> 15:03.401
It kind of looks like
helen morrison.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.403
Helen morrison?
Yeah.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.205
God, I haven't seen her
since high school.

15:07.207 --> 15:08.206
She went blonde.

15:08.208 --> 15:09.407
What high school?

15:09.409 --> 15:10.608
Uh, hardison high.

15:10.610 --> 15:14.412
Yeah, helen and I
grew up together.

15:14.414 --> 15:17.215
Wait, did you just say
that she was murdered?

15:17.217 --> 15:18.917
You moved out here together?

15:18.919 --> 15:20.485
No, no, I...

15:20.487 --> 15:22.553
I-I came out here
for college.

15:22.555 --> 15:24.923
The last I heard from helen,
she was living in...

15:24.925 --> 15:25.957
Saddle river.

15:25.959 --> 15:27.592
So you have
kept in touch?

15:27.594 --> 15:28.593
Well, no.

15:28.595 --> 15:29.594
I mean, not really.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.362
We-we reconnected online

15:31.364 --> 15:33.164
About six months ago.

15:33.166 --> 15:34.599
Did you know
she was in vegas?

15:34.601 --> 15:37.402
Well, I knew that she was
planning a trip out west,

15:37.404 --> 15:39.070
And maybe swinging
through vegas...

15:39.072 --> 15:41.005
And you two were gonna hook up,
is that the deal?

15:43.242 --> 15:44.509
Look, I can button
up that van,

15:44.511 --> 15:46.044
Tow it downtown,
and we can talk down there.

15:46.046 --> 15:47.045
I don't care.

15:47.047 --> 15:50.114
After helen found
me online, okay,

15:50.116 --> 15:51.449
She-she never mentioned

15:51.451 --> 15:53.451
That she was married.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.353
And then a couple
months later,
she let it slip.

15:55.355 --> 15:56.354
Now, look, I don't
mess around

15:56.356 --> 15:57.588
With married chicks anymore.

15:57.590 --> 15:59.057
There's too many
complications.

15:59.059 --> 16:00.258
You know what I mean.

16:01.593 --> 16:03.127
I cut it off.

16:03.129 --> 16:04.362
Then why was she calling you?

16:04.364 --> 16:06.731
I don't know.

16:06.733 --> 16:08.700
Look, I-I'd love
to help you guys out,

16:08.702 --> 16:10.268
But I've got my
hands full right now.

16:10.270 --> 16:12.470
Half my crew just
quit on me, so...

16:14.673 --> 16:16.975
You know what?

16:16.977 --> 16:19.210
Las night, I sent her call
through to voicemail.

16:19.212 --> 16:21.646
So... I mean,
knock yourself out.

16:21.648 --> 16:22.747
Helen (on voicemail):
Jeff, I know I'm not supposed

16:22.749 --> 16:24.682
To contact you,
but I need help.

16:24.684 --> 16:26.117
I don't know who else to ask.

16:26.119 --> 16:27.385
Just call me back.

16:27.387 --> 16:28.386
(phone beeps)

16:28.388 --> 16:29.520
Some friend.

16:29.522 --> 16:33.091
Like I said, I cut it off.

16:33.093 --> 16:34.625
Well, it's not
my problem.

16:36.228 --> 16:38.262
You know what?

16:38.264 --> 16:41.265
I bet you guys need some cleanup
every once in a while.

16:41.267 --> 16:43.234
I sure would love
the opportunity.

16:45.704 --> 16:48.139
Yeah, I'd love to help,
but my hands are full.

16:49.708 --> 16:52.110
â™ª

17:19.271 --> 17:22.140
â™ª

17:49.468 --> 17:51.636
â™ª

18:18.797 --> 18:21.132
â™ª

18:25.437 --> 18:27.205
Finlay: According to
the flight manifest,

18:27.207 --> 18:29.507
Helen morrison was
the last passenger

18:29.509 --> 18:30.875
To board flight 111.

18:30.877 --> 18:33.244
She sat here,
in 3-d.

18:33.246 --> 18:34.812
Flight attendant said
that her carry-on

18:34.814 --> 18:36.681
Did not fit underneath
the seat in front of her,

18:36.683 --> 18:38.816
The overhead bin
was full...

18:38.818 --> 18:41.619
I'm going to have
to take your bag, sweetie.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.454
I'd really prefer
to keep it down here.
I got it, I got it.

18:43.456 --> 18:45.490
I prefer to have
it here.
Thanks. I'll put it here.

18:45.492 --> 18:47.225
She stowed it here,

18:47.227 --> 18:48.493
Two rows back.

18:48.495 --> 18:49.794
The open bins are
the ones that were robbed?

18:49.796 --> 18:52.130
Yes, there were
12 passengers

18:52.132 --> 18:53.831
Who filed
police reports.

18:53.833 --> 18:56.567
These are the four
targeted bins.

18:56.569 --> 18:58.636
And in each one
of these bins

18:58.638 --> 19:00.371
There was at least one bag

19:00.373 --> 19:02.473
That was at some
distance from its owner.

19:02.475 --> 19:05.243
Well, that makes sense, because

19:05.245 --> 19:07.778
It's pretty risky to be rifling
through someone's bag

19:07.780 --> 19:09.514
When the owner is sitting
right beneath it.

19:09.516 --> 19:13.251
Rule number one of
the professional thief:

19:13.253 --> 19:15.586
Board the plane early.

19:15.588 --> 19:17.522
Find a seat with a view.

19:17.524 --> 19:18.923
And I don't mean
a view outside.

19:18.925 --> 19:20.224
Our crook,

19:20.226 --> 19:21.659
In order to get a view

19:21.661 --> 19:23.394
Of the targeted bins,

19:23.396 --> 19:26.531
Had to have sat
aft of row eight.

19:26.533 --> 19:28.366
And he didn't want
to sit so far back
in the plane

19:28.368 --> 19:29.634
That he was on
the flight attendant's lap.

19:29.636 --> 19:31.669
And we have to presume
that our suspect

19:31.671 --> 19:32.937
Boarded in
the first wave.

19:32.939 --> 19:34.872
So that definitely rules out

19:34.874 --> 19:36.874
Helen morrison as our thief.

19:36.876 --> 19:38.309
She boarded last,

19:38.311 --> 19:39.944
Sat forward of
the targeted bins,

19:39.946 --> 19:42.413
So she wouldn't have
been able to have eyes on.

19:42.415 --> 19:44.215
To get eyes on
and good visibility,

19:44.217 --> 19:46.284
An aisle seat
is the best seat.

19:46.286 --> 19:47.919
So that leaves
us with...

19:48.887 --> 19:50.354
...Eight suspects.

19:50.356 --> 19:51.556
Who boarded early?

19:53.559 --> 19:55.560
9-c.

19:55.562 --> 19:57.895
Hank kasserman boarded
with the first group.

19:57.897 --> 19:59.463
"families with children

19:59.465 --> 20:00.932
And those needing assistance."

20:00.934 --> 20:03.401
You think a senior citizen
would qualify for that?

20:03.403 --> 20:05.937
Because I spoke with
another passenger...

20:05.939 --> 20:08.239
His name is kenny greene.

20:08.241 --> 20:09.707
He had his watch stolen.

20:09.709 --> 20:10.975
Now, he told me
he had an altercation

20:10.977 --> 20:13.844
With, quote,
"an elderly gentleman"

20:13.846 --> 20:15.913
Who was in a real hurry
to get off the plane.

20:17.449 --> 20:19.450
Hank kasserman,

20:19.452 --> 20:21.385
You've been upgraded

20:21.387 --> 20:23.387
To our number one suspect.

20:27.993 --> 20:30.261
Hey, hank,
sit down, please.

20:34.433 --> 20:36.734
Wow, you know, hank,
you know, you got

20:36.736 --> 20:38.436
Almost enough
frequent flyer miles

20:38.438 --> 20:41.706
For a free room at
the grey bar motel.

20:41.708 --> 20:44.308
That's the minimum security
prison in indian springs.

20:44.310 --> 20:46.911
I was thinking of,
um, saving my miles

20:46.913 --> 20:48.879
For a trip to algeria.

20:48.881 --> 20:50.681
That's good.
There's no extradition.

20:50.683 --> 20:52.350
You know, more than a few
of your recent trips

20:52.352 --> 20:54.752
Have coincided with
in-flight thefts.

20:54.754 --> 20:57.622
That's why I got
a brand-new bag.

20:57.624 --> 20:59.757
Tamper-proof zipper

20:59.759 --> 21:01.592
And an extra lock.
You know,

21:01.594 --> 21:03.027
These days you can't
trust anyone, right?

21:03.029 --> 21:04.495
They're awful.

21:04.497 --> 21:05.630
And, by the way,
I like watches.

21:05.632 --> 21:07.031
That's a nice watch
you're wearing.

21:07.033 --> 21:08.833
Oh. Well, you see, it's new.

21:08.835 --> 21:10.268
Now, if I flipped
it over,

21:10.270 --> 21:12.670
I wouldn't see an engraving,
"cristal kenny"

21:12.672 --> 21:13.904
On the back, would I?

21:13.906 --> 21:15.573
Oh, yeah.
Kenny is my father.

21:16.776 --> 21:20.911
Yeah, you're very quick
for an old guy, I gotta tell ya.

21:20.913 --> 21:23.514
You're pretty slow
for a young guy.

21:23.516 --> 21:24.915
All right, let me show you
something.

21:24.917 --> 21:26.584
Here's a list of
the things

21:26.586 --> 21:28.519
That were stolen
from flight 111.

21:28.521 --> 21:32.657
Of the items that were recovered
from your hotel suite.

21:32.659 --> 21:33.791
Mm-hmm.

21:33.793 --> 21:35.059
It's an exact match.

21:35.061 --> 21:39.330
I hear you had a big night
at the casino last night.

21:39.332 --> 21:42.400
I was up, then I was down,
and I was up.

21:42.402 --> 21:44.435
Yeah, well,
now you're down again, hank,

21:44.437 --> 21:46.537
'cause you're with me.
You're in the police station.

21:46.539 --> 21:51.075
I've got you on
12 counts of grand larceny.

21:51.077 --> 21:54.011
So how far are you gonna fall?

21:56.682 --> 21:58.549
What do you want to know?

21:58.551 --> 22:00.685
You walked in the mediterranean
casino last night

22:00.687 --> 22:03.721
With a very big wedge of cash--
tell me about it.

22:03.723 --> 22:07.325
It's a score of a lifetime.

22:07.327 --> 22:08.759
There was a woman
on the plane.

22:08.761 --> 22:11.062
Blonde and in 3-d.

22:12.631 --> 22:14.665
<i>Clocked her the moment</i>
<i>she walked on the plane.</i>

22:14.667 --> 22:17.435
<i>Very well-dressed.</i>

22:17.437 --> 22:20.805
<i>And she was wearing expensive</i>
<i>shoes, expensive clothes.</i>

22:20.807 --> 22:22.873
<i>She had a designer carry-on.</i>

22:22.875 --> 22:24.542
<i>She was very reluctant</i>
<i>to let the flight attendant</i>

22:24.544 --> 22:26.944
<i>Put it in the bin</i>
<i>a few rows back.</i>

22:26.946 --> 22:28.446
Please... Please,
just this once, please...

22:28.448 --> 22:30.348
Can you just...?
Okay. Right there.

22:31.917 --> 22:36.454
So she put it two rows back
right over cristal kenny's seat.

22:36.456 --> 22:39.090
He was three sheets to the wind.
And I sent him a fourth.

22:39.092 --> 22:43.527
I'd like to buy my friend
in 5-d a drink.

22:43.529 --> 22:45.062
<i>I needed him passed out.</i>

22:45.064 --> 22:48.632
Passengers who are sleeping
or, uh, reading

22:48.634 --> 22:49.834
Or, uh, watching a movie,

22:49.836 --> 22:51.402
They're easy marks.

22:51.404 --> 22:54.004
Oh, you're a real student
of human nature, hank.

22:54.006 --> 22:57.808
When I'm working, I don't leave
anything to chance.

22:57.810 --> 23:00.010
When I'm playing...

23:00.012 --> 23:01.379
I'm all on black.

23:01.381 --> 23:03.914
What did you steal
from the blonde?

23:03.916 --> 23:07.017
Chick like that, I expected
you know, diamonds,

23:07.019 --> 23:08.652
Uh, jewelry.

23:08.654 --> 23:12.556
But.. I hit the mother lode.

23:20.599 --> 23:21.499
<i>30 g's.</i>

23:22.534 --> 23:24.935
Is this the blonde?

23:26.405 --> 23:28.539
Well, I had nothing
to do with that.

23:28.541 --> 23:31.742
Hank, it's time
to go all in now.

23:31.744 --> 23:33.911
All on the black.

23:35.614 --> 23:37.148
Okay.

23:37.150 --> 23:39.016
Let me tell you what I saw.

23:39.018 --> 23:41.919
A woman of means

23:41.921 --> 23:43.821
Traveling alone.

23:43.823 --> 23:45.689
She knew how to handle
that drunk.

23:45.691 --> 23:49.059
Never closed her eyes.
And kept,

23:49.061 --> 23:50.494
Kept putting makeup on.

23:50.496 --> 23:52.630
Especially over here.

23:52.632 --> 23:56.700
She was trying
to hide a, a bruise.

23:58.103 --> 24:00.738
Now she's dead?

24:02.107 --> 24:06.210
You should be looking
for that guy

24:06.212 --> 24:08.746
That used her as a punching bag.

24:08.748 --> 24:11.782
Not some senior citizen
on a fixed income.

24:17.722 --> 24:19.623
Sanders:
Hey, doc.

24:19.625 --> 24:21.525
Heard you got a c.O.D.
I do.

24:22.661 --> 24:25.796
Atlanto-occipital dislocation

24:25.798 --> 24:28.599
Due to being thrown
from a moving vehicle.

24:28.601 --> 24:30.801
But that's the least
troubling thing I found.

24:30.803 --> 24:33.204
Ms. Morrison was married.

24:33.206 --> 24:35.706
Yeah. Brass is tracking down
her husband.

24:35.708 --> 24:38.742
She has multiple perimortem
fractures consistent with

24:38.744 --> 24:40.177
Falling from a moving vehicle,

24:40.179 --> 24:44.682
But these bony calluses
indicate healed fractures.

24:44.684 --> 24:47.551
This ulna fracture here
is typically the result

24:47.553 --> 24:51.655
Of a direct blow while
the arm's in self-defense.

24:51.657 --> 24:53.557
No... No!

24:53.559 --> 24:55.593
Ms. Morrison has also has
several broken ribs.

24:55.595 --> 24:58.529
Two ribs, two separate events.

24:58.531 --> 25:00.698
Left number five, judging
by the size of the callus,

25:00.700 --> 25:01.999
Is about six months old.

25:02.001 --> 25:03.934
Break to left number six,

25:03.936 --> 25:06.737
Callus is larger,
but not fully formed.

25:06.739 --> 25:09.273
That's a recent injury,
only a few weeks.

25:09.275 --> 25:11.942
It looks like he gave her
a black eye, too.

25:11.944 --> 25:13.677
Yeah, it was hidden
under her makeup.

25:13.679 --> 25:15.779
That's only a few days old.

25:15.781 --> 25:18.215
Well, the old man
on the plane was right.

25:18.217 --> 25:20.184
She's been physically abused.

25:20.186 --> 25:23.287
Yeah. Given the number
of healed fractures,

25:23.289 --> 25:25.623
It's been going on for years.

25:36.968 --> 25:39.837
Yeah, I heard the airline
finally located

25:39.839 --> 25:41.105
Helen morrison's
checked luggage.

25:41.107 --> 25:42.840
And not what you
usually pack

25:42.842 --> 25:44.041
For a weekend
in vegas:

25:44.043 --> 25:46.544
Childhood photos,
teddy bear...

25:47.579 --> 25:49.113
Her bronzed baby shoes.

25:49.115 --> 25:52.049
No, that's what you pack when
you're never going home again.

25:52.051 --> 25:54.018
She was definitely leaving
her husband.

25:54.020 --> 25:55.586
New identity,
new cell phone.

25:55.588 --> 25:57.555
$30,000 in cash.

25:57.557 --> 25:59.690
She had a plan.

25:59.692 --> 26:01.058
Saddle river pd
just called.

26:01.060 --> 26:02.226
Helen morrison's
husband was not home.

26:02.228 --> 26:03.994
Evidently,

26:03.996 --> 26:05.729
He caught a flight to vegas.

26:05.731 --> 26:08.699
So, the woman he's been using
as a punching bag

26:08.701 --> 26:10.067
Finally left him
and he followed her.

26:10.069 --> 26:12.937
Do we know what time
his flight got in?

26:12.939 --> 26:14.004
Yeah.
Morrison caught a nonstop.

26:14.006 --> 26:17.775
So that put him in about
15 minutes before her.

26:17.777 --> 26:19.810
Well, that give him motive
and opportunity.

26:19.812 --> 26:21.912
(phone ringing)
yep. Hold on a sec.

26:23.682 --> 26:25.883
Doc robbins says that
out concerned husband

26:25.885 --> 26:27.952
Is in autopsy as we speak.

26:27.954 --> 26:30.054
What the hell's he doing
down there?
No idea.

26:30.056 --> 26:31.622
Man:
<i>Look, doctor, I know</i>

26:31.624 --> 26:33.757
You've got your rules,
but we're talking about my wife!

26:33.759 --> 26:35.626
The cops just told me
that she was dead.

26:35.628 --> 26:38.062
I have a right to say good-bye.

26:38.064 --> 26:39.863
Look, her body's already been
identified.

26:39.865 --> 26:41.799
There's no reason
for you to be here.

26:41.801 --> 26:43.300
No reason?
A mortuary can

26:43.302 --> 26:44.635
Provide the final viewing.

26:44.637 --> 26:47.805
What are you talking about?
I'm not your wife!

26:47.807 --> 26:49.974
Hey, hey, hey! Mr. Morrison,
what are you doing?

26:49.976 --> 26:52.076
Sorry. I just got
a little worked up.

26:52.078 --> 26:53.811
All right,
I'm nick stokes.

26:53.813 --> 26:56.046
I'm the one handling
your wife's murder, okay?

26:56.048 --> 26:58.782
Did you catch the bastard
who did it yet?

26:58.784 --> 27:00.351
I will.

27:00.353 --> 27:02.686
Well, what's that
supposed to mean?

27:02.688 --> 27:04.755
That the, that the husband
is always the first suspect?

27:04.757 --> 27:06.824
There's a good reason for that.

27:06.826 --> 27:10.694
Listen, my wife and I had
a very physical relationship.

27:10.696 --> 27:12.262
Oh, we know. Bodies don't lie.

27:12.264 --> 27:13.764
What's this say?!

27:15.066 --> 27:17.101
She liked to test me.

27:17.103 --> 27:19.737
She liked to make me
feel jealous.

27:19.739 --> 27:22.706
She would leave little bread
crumbs all over the place.

27:22.708 --> 27:26.110
Like a few months ago when
she left her e-mail open

27:26.112 --> 27:28.078
So that I could read
a little exchange

27:28.080 --> 27:29.380
Between her
and an old flame.

27:29.382 --> 27:30.848
That's why
you broke her arm.

27:30.850 --> 27:31.949
Would you shut up?

27:31.951 --> 27:35.252
There were pictures,
explicit pictures.

27:35.254 --> 27:38.255
So when I confronted her,
she denied it.

27:38.257 --> 27:39.990
Which is another game
she likes to play.

27:39.992 --> 27:43.394
But yesterday,
helen crossed the line.

27:43.396 --> 27:46.263
I get a call from my bank

27:46.265 --> 27:49.433
Which says that she withdrew
all of our money.

27:49.435 --> 27:51.835
All of <i>my</i> money.

27:51.837 --> 27:55.005
So I go home,
and she's gone.

27:55.007 --> 27:56.740
And you took
the next flight out.

27:56.742 --> 27:58.108
So you'd be here
when she landed.

27:58.110 --> 28:00.210
Yes, that's right, sherlock.

28:00.212 --> 28:02.813
I figured she would run
to her boyfriend.

28:02.815 --> 28:04.314
But my plane was delayed.

28:04.316 --> 28:06.350
A mechanical error.

28:06.352 --> 28:09.186
And I didn't get in
until after midnight.

28:10.889 --> 28:13.190
Which is probably better.

28:13.192 --> 28:14.725
Saved me a life sentence.

28:14.727 --> 28:18.829
Okay, fine, do that, doctor!
Check the airlines!

28:18.831 --> 28:21.398
But I'm not leaving here until
I see my wife's dead body.

28:21.400 --> 28:23.167
And I want my money back.

28:23.169 --> 28:24.435
Now, tell me about
this boyfriend.

28:24.437 --> 28:26.170
Does he have a name?

28:26.172 --> 28:28.305
He has this little
housecleaning business,

28:28.307 --> 28:30.307
The little schmuck.

28:30.309 --> 28:31.909
His name is jefferson.

28:35.980 --> 28:39.750
When that psychotic husband
of hers found out

28:39.752 --> 28:42.052
That we'd been chatting online,

28:42.054 --> 28:44.154
He put her in the hospital.
If you're looking

28:44.156 --> 28:46.890
For who killed her,
you should look at him.

28:46.892 --> 28:47.991
That guy is dangerous.

28:47.993 --> 28:49.893
He's a control freak.

28:49.895 --> 28:52.863
He monitored all
of her phone calls,

28:52.865 --> 28:57.067
He kept track of every nickel
that she spent.

28:57.069 --> 29:00.838
Now, look, I-I know you think
that I am a real s.O.B., but...

29:00.840 --> 29:02.072
Maybe if you'd
helped her,

29:02.074 --> 29:05.375
Answered her call,
she'd still be alive.

29:05.377 --> 29:06.477
I did help her.

29:06.479 --> 29:08.479
When I found out

29:08.481 --> 29:11.248
That allen had been
hitting her,

29:11.250 --> 29:14.852
How many times he put her
in the hospital,

29:14.854 --> 29:17.955
I begged her
to leave him.

29:17.957 --> 29:20.924
I set her up with this guy.
I-I met him

29:20.926 --> 29:22.926
In a bar a while back.

29:22.928 --> 29:24.528
And for a price,

29:24.530 --> 29:28.532
He could make anybody disappear.

29:28.534 --> 29:30.467
This guy have a name?

29:30.469 --> 29:31.969
He went by "the wolf."

29:31.971 --> 29:33.203
The wolf?

29:33.205 --> 29:34.938
He was like
a private witness

29:34.940 --> 29:37.174
Relocation program.

29:37.176 --> 29:40.210
And I, I arranged
the-the introduction.

29:40.212 --> 29:41.912
Did he pick her up
at the airport?

29:41.914 --> 29:44.281
See, that's just the thing.
I don't know. I-I'm not sure.

29:44.283 --> 29:46.250
See, he had these rules,

29:46.252 --> 29:51.155
And helen and I, we were to cut
off all communication

29:51.157 --> 29:54.258
With each other for at least
six months, maybe more.

29:54.260 --> 29:57.361
And we weren't supposed
to trust calls

29:57.363 --> 29:58.929
Or e-mails from each other

29:58.931 --> 30:00.297
Because they could've
been a trap.

30:00.299 --> 30:03.500
And we could have ended up hurt
or... Or dead.

30:03.502 --> 30:08.172
Last night, and then she was
pushed from a moving vehicle.

30:09.574 --> 30:12.075
Do you think that
the wolf killed her?

30:12.077 --> 30:13.477
How do I get a hold of him?

30:13.479 --> 30:17.981
Well, I, uh... I have cell phone
number for him.

30:17.983 --> 30:19.483
I-I don't know
if it's still good.

30:22.854 --> 30:26.089
Sidle:
<i>It's the phone number that</i>
<i>helen texted when she landed.</i>

30:26.091 --> 30:29.026
According to the boyfriend,
it was payment on arrival.

30:29.028 --> 30:30.828
The wolf had paid
for her plane ticket,

30:30.830 --> 30:34.464
And any other arrangements that
he'd made for her future.

30:34.466 --> 30:37.134
But after she was robbed,
she had no money to pay him.

30:37.136 --> 30:40.170
Probably why she ignored
the wolf's instructions
and called the boyfriend.

30:40.172 --> 30:41.205
But he didn't answer.

30:41.207 --> 30:42.206
She really had no choice.

30:42.208 --> 30:43.373
She had to stick to the plan.

30:43.375 --> 30:46.343
Well, he left a trail, so...

30:46.345 --> 30:48.178
Let's track down this wolf.

31:16.307 --> 31:18.876
â™ª

31:33.659 --> 31:37.094
<i>Where the vic's boyfriend</i>
<i>says he met the wolf.</i>

31:37.096 --> 31:39.463
No one there knew him.
Although the sun was still up.

31:39.465 --> 31:41.965
So we'll go back later
and talk to the night crowd.

31:41.967 --> 31:43.433
But I did meet a guy
named "the goat,"

31:43.435 --> 31:45.602
Who says he'll eat
anything for a dollar.

31:45.604 --> 31:46.904
Beard, pierced ear?
Yeah.

31:46.906 --> 31:48.972
I had to get evidence
out of him once.

31:48.974 --> 31:50.307
Gross.

31:50.309 --> 31:53.644
At the silver wagon
convenience store on flamingo.

31:53.646 --> 31:55.412
No functioning cameras.

31:55.414 --> 31:56.680
Buyer paid all cash.

31:56.682 --> 31:58.582
Her plane ticket was bought
on boulder highway

31:58.584 --> 31:59.650
At truxton travel.

31:59.652 --> 32:01.018
Let me guess--
cash, no cameras.

32:01.020 --> 32:03.086
You got it.
Thank you.

32:03.088 --> 32:04.321
Any luck?

32:04.323 --> 32:06.523
Uh, wolf's phone
has gone silent.

32:06.525 --> 32:08.625
No activity since last
night around midnight.

32:08.627 --> 32:10.494
Time of the murder.

32:10.496 --> 32:13.997
Yeah, and his call detail
records have come in.

32:13.999 --> 32:15.999
The phone was activated
ten weeks ago.

32:16.001 --> 32:18.268
Since then, it's been used
around the greater vegas area.

32:18.270 --> 32:20.671
90% of all the activity occurred

32:20.673 --> 32:23.206
Between 10:00 p.M.
And 6:00 a.M.

32:23.208 --> 32:25.208
Sounds like
our werewolf works nights.

32:25.210 --> 32:27.277
And he definitely has a routine.

32:27.279 --> 32:28.578
Every Monday night,

32:28.580 --> 32:31.281
His phone pings off
of the tower in henderson.

32:31.283 --> 32:33.350
On tuesdays he's
in spring valley.

32:33.352 --> 32:35.085
Helen's plane ticket
was purchased

32:35.087 --> 32:36.286
In henderson on a Monday.

32:36.288 --> 32:38.689
And the phone
in spring valley on a Tuesday.

32:38.691 --> 32:40.724
Where was the wolf last night?

32:40.726 --> 32:44.027
On Wednesday he was
just off the strip

32:44.029 --> 32:45.262
Near the airport.

32:46.431 --> 32:48.498
When I was 15,
I tried to make

32:48.500 --> 32:51.368
A fake I.D. Using pencil,
chalk and hair spray.

32:51.370 --> 32:53.270
If I had one that was this good,

32:53.272 --> 32:55.238
I could've gotten
into any bar I wanted.

32:55.240 --> 32:58.041
When you were 15, you probably
looked more like you were 12.

32:58.043 --> 33:01.044
And not even a letter from your
dad would've gotten you in.

33:01.046 --> 33:04.414
Well, helen morrison's
fake license

33:04.416 --> 33:05.716
Isn't even a license.

33:05.718 --> 33:07.217
Official dmv licenses
aren't chipped.

33:07.219 --> 33:10.354
And I found
an rfid chip in hers.

33:10.356 --> 33:13.023
Common in security badges
like ours.

33:13.025 --> 33:14.191
So where do you get
one of those?

33:14.193 --> 33:16.093
The county prints ours.

33:16.095 --> 33:17.661
For casinos and large companies,
they make their own.

33:17.663 --> 33:19.196
And there are
a couple dozen businesses

33:19.198 --> 33:23.734
So the wolf had access to blank
security cards and a printer.

33:23.736 --> 33:25.168
Not just any printer.

33:25.170 --> 33:26.636
This is a quality print job

33:26.638 --> 33:28.438
From a top-of-the-line
digital printer.

33:28.440 --> 33:31.408
Which narrows it down
to only a dozen facilities.

33:34.579 --> 33:36.680
"slots of luck industries,

33:36.682 --> 33:40.450
We have his phone pinging
off the tower

33:40.452 --> 33:41.518
In north las vegas.

33:41.520 --> 33:43.086
North las vegas means

33:43.088 --> 33:44.588
He was there on Friday.

33:53.531 --> 33:56.199
We were the first company
in vegas to get the lazgan.

33:56.201 --> 33:59.202
Better printer means
I can charge more for jobs.

33:59.204 --> 34:00.670
We don't print
driver's licenses.

34:00.672 --> 34:02.339
Yeah, but could you
if you wanted to?

34:02.341 --> 34:03.673
It's against the law.

34:03.675 --> 34:05.208
It's not a trick question.

34:05.210 --> 34:07.110
Is your machine capable
of printing this?

34:07.112 --> 34:08.712
Technically, yes.

34:08.714 --> 34:11.081
I print all our
employee I.D. Badges.

34:11.083 --> 34:12.549
So, to make
a driver's license,

34:12.551 --> 34:14.384
It's just a matter
of downloading the template

34:14.386 --> 34:18.321
But it's against the law.
But it's against the law.

34:19.424 --> 34:20.824
We have reason to believe
that someone printed

34:20.826 --> 34:22.659
This license on that machine.

34:22.661 --> 34:25.228
If it was one of my employees,
that's cause for termination.

34:25.230 --> 34:27.697
How about outside
normal business hours?

34:27.699 --> 34:29.266
Only my security guard
has access.

34:29.268 --> 34:31.501
But george has been
with us forever.

34:31.503 --> 34:32.636
Does he work Friday nights?

34:32.638 --> 34:34.171
Yes.

34:34.173 --> 34:36.239
And the cleaning crew.

34:36.241 --> 34:39.076
They're here every Friday.

34:40.244 --> 34:42.245
Hey, stokes.

34:42.247 --> 34:44.681
Hooked you up with
some rougher customers.

34:46.617 --> 34:48.285
Oh, yeah.

34:52.657 --> 34:54.691
Scoot over

34:54.693 --> 34:56.226
For me, will you, boys?

34:56.228 --> 34:57.794
Thanks.

35:01.399 --> 35:02.833
What's up?

35:02.835 --> 35:05.102
I'm in a lot of trouble
because of you.

35:05.104 --> 35:06.536
Because of me?

35:06.538 --> 35:08.371
I'm not the one that made
you smoke dope,

35:08.373 --> 35:10.740
Get all dumb and endanger
planeloads of people.

35:10.742 --> 35:13.844
My dad took my car away.
Oh.

35:13.846 --> 35:16.213
And that guy said
that I'm looking

35:16.215 --> 35:18.548
At 4,000 hours of
community service.

35:18.550 --> 35:21.251
Could be staring at a felony.
Or you could be sharing

35:21.253 --> 35:23.487
A cell with this fella
right here.

35:23.489 --> 35:24.688
You'd like that,
wouldn't you?

35:24.690 --> 35:27.124
See there? You're
already making friends.

35:27.126 --> 35:29.226
No...
(clears throat)

35:29.228 --> 35:31.128
Now, I can't
really do anything

35:31.130 --> 35:32.395
About your old man,

35:32.397 --> 35:35.298
But I might be able to shave
a few thousand hours

35:35.300 --> 35:36.833
Of community service off.

35:36.835 --> 35:39.136
What do I have to do?
Last night,

35:39.138 --> 35:41.171
Air traffic control reported

35:41.173 --> 35:43.907
Laser hits on inbound
flights at 11:25.

35:43.909 --> 35:46.376
That puts you at the
end of the runway

35:46.378 --> 35:49.346
When my victim was thrown
out of a moving car.

35:49.348 --> 35:50.814
What'd you see?

35:50.816 --> 35:52.682
(laughs)
I don't know.

35:52.684 --> 35:55.418
There was lots of planes.

35:55.420 --> 35:57.621
Uh, a f... A few cars.

35:57.623 --> 36:00.423
Then a-a lot of cops.

36:00.425 --> 36:01.725
You...

36:01.727 --> 36:04.761
Were there.

36:06.197 --> 36:07.931
4,000 hours
of community service.

36:07.933 --> 36:09.633
That's like being
busy every weekend

36:09.635 --> 36:11.701
For the next ten years, so...

36:11.703 --> 36:13.436
Come-come on, man,
listen... (groans)

36:13.438 --> 36:17.240
I was really stoned, man.

36:17.242 --> 36:19.242
I mean, help me out, guys--
even if you're really stoned,

36:19.244 --> 36:22.479
You notice if a car's
going too fast.

36:22.481 --> 36:23.880
Or if it's swerving.

36:23.882 --> 36:25.515
A woman's dead.

36:25.517 --> 36:27.250
You realize that, right?

36:27.252 --> 36:29.319
Yeah.
Okay, so think.

36:29.321 --> 36:31.621
If it wasn't a car,
maybe it was something else.

36:31.623 --> 36:33.523
Maybe it was something bigger.

36:33.525 --> 36:35.392
Oh, there-there was this guy.

36:35.394 --> 36:36.660
Um...

36:36.662 --> 36:39.763
A farmer with a pitchfork.

36:39.765 --> 36:41.798
Farmer with a pitchfork
at the end of the tarmac?

36:41.800 --> 36:44.668
Well, no, like, not...
He wasn't a... Why?

36:44.670 --> 36:46.403
You can have a seat right here.
Well, I was...

36:46.405 --> 36:47.938
Why don't you two guys
get to know each other?
Well...

36:47.940 --> 36:50.273
He says there's a farmer
with a pitchfork

36:50.275 --> 36:51.408
At the end of the tarmac?

36:51.410 --> 36:54.211
No... (laughs)

36:54.213 --> 36:56.246
Not a... He's not a real guy.

36:56.248 --> 36:57.781
It was... He was a cartoon.

36:57.783 --> 36:59.816
Okay.
No!

36:59.818 --> 37:02.385
No, it was on...
It was on a side of a van!

37:02.387 --> 37:04.621
It looked like a farmer
with a pitchfork.

37:04.623 --> 37:05.789
Only it was, uh,

37:05.791 --> 37:09.259
It was some moron with a mop.

37:11.395 --> 37:13.597
Moron with a mop?

37:13.599 --> 37:14.731
Yeah.

37:16.767 --> 37:18.835
Was it that moron?

37:20.504 --> 37:21.504
Yeah.

37:21.506 --> 37:23.406
That's him.

37:24.909 --> 37:27.410
Brass: So, a witness places
your van at the crime scene

37:27.412 --> 37:28.645
At the time
of helen's murder.

37:28.647 --> 37:31.314
And truxton travel
I.D.'d you from a photo.

37:31.316 --> 37:33.917
Where you bought
a plane ticket for helen.

37:33.919 --> 37:36.453
And we know that you printed
helen's fake license

37:36.455 --> 37:38.355
At slots of luck
where you used to work

37:38.357 --> 37:39.756
Every Friday night.

37:39.758 --> 37:41.591
Yeah, well, I-I was...

37:41.593 --> 37:43.994
I was trying to help her.

37:43.996 --> 37:45.895
I loved helen.

37:45.897 --> 37:48.031
So you made up some
fake hero named the wolf?

37:48.033 --> 37:49.633
She was terrified
that her husband

37:49.635 --> 37:51.468
Was gonna kill us both.

37:51.470 --> 37:53.336
So, she didn't want me involved.

37:53.338 --> 37:55.005
But I wasn't gonna
turn my back...

37:55.007 --> 37:56.640
You weren't gonna turn
your back on her money.

37:56.642 --> 37:57.641
It wasn't her money.

37:57.643 --> 37:58.742
It was allen's money.

37:58.744 --> 38:00.277
Yeah, $30,000, right?

38:00.279 --> 38:01.945
Now, was the amount
that the wolf told

38:01.947 --> 38:03.546
Helen it would cost
to start her new life?

38:03.548 --> 38:06.650
Or was 30k the number

38:06.652 --> 38:08.885
That helen said
that she could get her hands on?

38:08.887 --> 38:12.322
It wasn't like that.

38:12.324 --> 38:13.823
She was getting a fresh start.

38:13.825 --> 38:18.695
I was getting the money,
but I was also getting my girl.

38:20.498 --> 38:22.766
Hey!

38:22.768 --> 38:24.868
What are you doing here?

38:24.870 --> 38:27.504
How did you know I'd be here?
I'm meeting the wolf.

38:27.506 --> 38:29.339
You can't be here!
Change of plans. Get in.

38:29.341 --> 38:31.374
No, you heard what he said.
We can't be seen together.

38:31.376 --> 38:32.742
It's all right.
He called me. Come on.

38:32.744 --> 38:36.613
No, helen, everything's
gonna be fine, all right?

38:36.615 --> 38:38.081
Just get in.

38:38.083 --> 38:40.083
I'm gonna take you
to the motel.

38:40.085 --> 38:42.819
And then I'm gonna bring
the wolf his money.

38:42.821 --> 38:44.954
I don't have it.

38:45.990 --> 38:47.824
Someone stole it.
Stole it?

38:47.826 --> 38:48.992
In my carry-on, on the plane.

38:48.994 --> 38:50.560
Someone stole it!

38:50.562 --> 38:51.928
No, you don't understand.

38:51.930 --> 38:53.596
The wolf needs his money.

38:53.598 --> 38:55.665
He can't help you
without the money.

38:55.667 --> 38:56.933
Where is the wolf?
Where is the wolf?

38:56.935 --> 38:58.802
I need to talk to the wolf.

38:58.804 --> 39:00.437
Brass:
<i>So, there was no wolf.</i>

39:00.439 --> 39:01.671
There was no happy ending.

39:01.673 --> 39:03.440
It was all about the money.

39:03.442 --> 39:04.541
You killed her.

39:05.576 --> 39:06.943
You're as bad as her husband.

39:07.845 --> 39:09.679
Look, you're right.

39:09.681 --> 39:11.514
I-I-I-I was upset

39:11.516 --> 39:13.817
About the money,
and I-I lost my cool.

39:13.819 --> 39:15.819
But I loved helen.

39:15.821 --> 39:17.554
I-I was planning

39:17.556 --> 39:19.356
A life with her.

39:19.358 --> 39:22.692
And when I told her
that there was no wolf,

39:22.694 --> 39:24.060
She freaked out.

39:24.062 --> 39:25.662
Helen:
<i>I trusted you!</i>

39:25.664 --> 39:29.432
How could you do this to me?!

39:29.434 --> 39:31.134
You just wanted the money.
What?

39:31.136 --> 39:32.669
You were never gonna help me.

39:32.671 --> 39:34.571
No, helen, that is not true.

39:34.573 --> 39:36.439
You told me
to leave my husband.

39:36.441 --> 39:38.408
You told me I would be safe!

39:38.410 --> 39:41.711
Allen's gonna find me
and he's gonna kill me.

39:41.713 --> 39:42.746
No, helen...

39:42.748 --> 39:43.813
Pull over, stop the car.

39:43.815 --> 39:45.882
No, oh, my god!
Just stop the car!

39:45.884 --> 39:47.884
Helen!, no!
Stop the car!

39:47.886 --> 39:49.419
No! Oh, my god!

39:49.421 --> 39:50.754
Stop the car and pull over!
Aah!

39:50.756 --> 39:51.988
No, no, stop it!

39:51.990 --> 39:53.590
Get down!
Stop the car!

39:53.592 --> 39:54.824
My god, you're
gonna kill us both!

39:54.826 --> 39:56.459
Let me out! Just let me out!

39:56.461 --> 39:58.128
I need to get out!
Helen! Oh, my god, no!

39:58.130 --> 39:58.895
I need to get...
No!

39:58.897 --> 40:00.029
Let go of me!

40:00.031 --> 40:02.699
Stop it!

40:02.701 --> 40:04.167
(tires screech)

40:04.169 --> 40:07.437
I am done with that.

40:08.839 --> 40:10.006
(both grunting)

40:10.008 --> 40:11.007
No one hits me!

40:11.009 --> 40:12.442
No!
(screams)

40:12.444 --> 40:13.643
No!

40:13.645 --> 40:15.578
Sit down!
(screaming)

40:15.580 --> 40:17.147
Helen!
(helen screams)

40:18.149 --> 40:19.616
(van tires screeching)

40:19.618 --> 40:21.050
I didn't mean to hurt her.

40:21.052 --> 40:23.186
So you pushed her
out of a van

40:23.188 --> 40:25.789
Going 45 miles an hour.

40:25.791 --> 40:28.892
And kept on driving.

40:28.894 --> 40:29.893
I loved her.

40:29.895 --> 40:30.927
Sidle:
No, you didn't.

40:30.929 --> 40:33.963
If you did, jefferson,

40:33.965 --> 40:36.800
You would've pulled over.

40:46.777 --> 40:48.812
Call a cab?

40:48.814 --> 40:50.814
Thanks for getting
my money back.

40:50.816 --> 40:52.515
Or what was left of it.

40:52.517 --> 40:55.785
Either way it was
the cheapest divorce I ever had.

40:55.787 --> 40:59.823
You know, you can convince
yourself all day long

40:59.825 --> 41:01.925
That you came down here
chasing after that money.

41:01.927 --> 41:04.060
But we both know the
truth, don't we?

41:04.062 --> 41:05.895
Look, the-the truth is...

41:05.897 --> 41:08.231
Is that helen got
what she deserved.

41:08.233 --> 41:10.934
Really? Okay, um, you know what?

41:10.936 --> 41:12.669
You can take off, bro.

41:12.671 --> 41:14.170
Whoa, whoa, whoa, that's my cab.

41:14.172 --> 41:15.738
No, no, that was your cab.

41:15.740 --> 41:18.208
Hey, what the hell's
going on here?

41:18.210 --> 41:19.542
Get your hands off of me!

41:19.544 --> 41:20.910
I am placing you
under arrest

41:20.912 --> 41:22.846
For felony assault.

41:22.848 --> 41:24.981
And in nevada, that carries,
what, three to 13?

41:24.983 --> 41:27.116
I never touched her in nevada.

41:27.118 --> 41:28.518
No, no, I'm not talking
about your ex-wife.

41:28.520 --> 41:29.486
I'm talking

41:29.488 --> 41:30.487
About my medical examiner,

41:30.489 --> 41:32.088
Doc robbins.

41:32.090 --> 41:33.223
The guy on crutches

41:33.225 --> 41:34.224
That you pushed.

41:34.226 --> 41:35.992
Oh, come on, man!

41:35.994 --> 41:37.861
That's like hitting a cop.
Are you joking?

41:37.863 --> 41:39.596
The judge is gonna
laugh you out of court.

41:39.598 --> 41:40.730
Maybe he will,

41:40.732 --> 41:41.764
Maybe he won't,
but it's, like,

41:41.766 --> 41:43.733
4:00 on a Friday afternoon.

41:43.735 --> 41:45.101
Nothing's gonna happen
till Monday morning.

41:48.272 --> 41:50.273
Have a good weekend.

41:50.275 --> 41:51.975
