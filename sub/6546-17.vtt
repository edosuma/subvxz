00:01.002 --> 00:01.991
(Nathan): Previously on Haven...

00:02.128 --> 00:04.210
- You can't find a town
with 25,000 people?

00:04.338 --> 00:06.670
(man): Haven, Maine, like your money,
doesn ’t exist.

00:06.799 --> 00:10.337
- This ring, it's part of a set.
Every member in our family has one.

00:10.469 --> 00:12.460
- You're stuck here
with no ticket home.

00:12.597 --> 00:14.258
- I'm trying to fix things.

00:14.390 --> 00:15.800
- Try to fix the Troubles.

00:15.933 --> 00:19.346
- Thanks to our friend there,
we're keeping them in a prison of sorts.

00:19.478 --> 00:22.265
- The people I touch
enter a slumber.

00:22.398 --> 00:25.390
And they cannot hurt anyone.
- What kind of sleep are they experiencing?

00:25.526 --> 00:28.142
- Dreamless sleep.
- Did they force you to do this?

00:28.279 --> 00:30.861
If you change your mind,
just come and find me.

00:30.990 --> 00:32.321
- Thank you.

00:32.450 --> 00:34.816
- You need to let Grayson go.
- Is that true?

00:34.952 --> 00:37.568
- He can't hear you,
he is hearing impaired.

00:38.706 --> 00:42.164
Grayson?
The Sandman.

00:44.045 --> 00:46.036
- I hate that name.

00:47.548 --> 00:51.211
(The Chordettes' Mr. Sandman playing)

00:51.594 --> 00:54.336
(Audrey): I know, right?
That is a lot of prawns.

00:54.472 --> 00:57.009
But my family loves them.

00:57.433 --> 00:59.845
Oh, somebody's beeping in
on the other line.

00:59.977 --> 01:01.353
Katarina?

01:01.479 --> 01:04.186
Hi, thank you for getting
back to me so quickly.

01:04.315 --> 01:06.306
Would I be the worst Bridezilla ever

01:06.442 --> 01:09.934
if I asked to put a gardenia
in my bouquet?

01:10.071 --> 01:11.356
(chuckles)

01:11.489 --> 01:14.401
Okay, you are so sweet.

01:14.533 --> 01:15.818
(chuckles)

01:17.495 --> 01:19.986
I know, I'm going to try
it on right now.

01:20.122 --> 01:23.990
It's my last chance
before the real thing.

01:25.294 --> 01:26.704
Mm.

01:26.837 --> 01:29.249
Listen, I have one more call
that I need to make

01:29.382 --> 01:33.546
before I have to take a long,
hot bath, so bye.

01:40.476 --> 01:44.594
# Mr. Sandman
bring me a dream... #

01:47.066 --> 01:48.146
Hi.

01:49.777 --> 01:52.814
Hi, ljust...
I wanted to tell you that l...

01:54.282 --> 01:56.318
I can't wait to be your wife.

02:03.124 --> 02:04.113
- Audrey?

02:05.584 --> 02:06.960
Parker!

02:09.255 --> 02:11.246
Parker.
Parker.

02:12.008 --> 02:12.918
Audrey?

02:17.888 --> 02:18.877
Come on.

02:21.851 --> 02:24.433
Hands up.
Who are you?

02:25.062 --> 02:26.017
What happened here?

02:27.523 --> 02:28.603
Wake up!

02:29.400 --> 02:31.140
Tell me what you did
to Audrey Parker.

02:32.737 --> 02:34.318
Tell me what you did to Audrey!

02:38.826 --> 02:39.906
- I'm so sorry.

02:40.578 --> 02:41.909
She's gone.

02:43.039 --> 02:45.951
(somber folk music)

03:15.821 --> 03:18.563
- Hello, friends.
This is Darkside Seeker Seth Byrne,

03:18.699 --> 03:20.314
bringing you the truth from this...

03:21.660 --> 03:24.823
uh, parking lot,
where strange things happen.

03:24.955 --> 03:27.367
What are you doing?
Don't do that. I paid you 20 bucks.

03:27.500 --> 03:31.163
- What are you talking, strange things?
Not on my watch.

03:33.214 --> 03:34.750
- Okay, great.

03:34.882 --> 03:37.624
You say that a woman
passed right through a shipping container.

03:37.760 --> 03:39.466
- I don't know what I saw.

03:39.595 --> 03:41.426
But it happened here.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.092
(knocking)

03:44.225 --> 03:45.214
- Pure steel.

03:46.143 --> 03:47.849
Witnesses claim
our mystery woman

03:47.978 --> 03:49.309
phased right through it.

03:49.438 --> 03:51.520
But who could have
the power to do that?

03:51.649 --> 03:53.685
And is she even human?

03:53.818 --> 03:55.354
What do you think?

03:55.486 --> 03:59.070
- You have ten minutes
to get off the property, Curly.

04:00.991 --> 04:03.903
- Seekers, we are surrounded
on all sides by skeptics.

04:05.079 --> 04:08.571
But we will look inside
because we may find clues.

04:13.671 --> 04:15.502
(groans)

04:15.631 --> 04:17.917
Orjust a really
well-dressed homeless guy.

04:19.468 --> 04:21.424
Great.
- Seth?

04:22.096 --> 04:23.176
- Yeah?

04:23.764 --> 04:26.176
What?
(Duke scoffing)

04:27.518 --> 04:29.349
- I'm not even surprised.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.848
- Okay.
I'm sorry, do I know you?

04:32.273 --> 04:34.810
- Good. Yeah.
Actually, that's good.

04:34.942 --> 04:37.399
That's... that's exactly how I feel.

04:37.528 --> 04:41.237
In fact, unless somebody
is holding a pocket knife at twins,

04:41.365 --> 04:43.526
you are not gonna tell
Audrey or Nathan where I am.

04:43.659 --> 04:46.071
You understand?
Okay?

04:46.203 --> 04:48.819
- Okay.
I don't know who that is.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.037
- Come on.
Audrey.

04:54.879 --> 04:56.164
Parker.

04:58.215 --> 04:59.421
Wacky town.
- No.

04:59.550 --> 05:00.539
- Yes!

05:01.343 --> 05:02.674
We... we... we...
we... we fought,

05:02.803 --> 05:05.920
like, a big, giant, hairy monster together.
It was ripping people's hearts out.

05:06.056 --> 05:08.547
- Yeah, see, I do know what a Rougarou is.
- Okay!

05:08.684 --> 05:11.050
- If I'd seen one,
I'm pretty sure I'd remember.

05:11.187 --> 05:13.394
However, I have no trouble
remembering that you just

05:13.522 --> 05:15.934
threatened to separate
me from my testicles.

05:16.066 --> 05:18.978
So I think I'm gonna say... bye.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.435
- Wait.
Hey, hey, hey.

05:21.572 --> 05:23.608
Hang on.
Wait.

05:23.741 --> 05:24.696
- What?

05:24.825 --> 05:27.862
- You're the second person I've come across
who has no memory of Haven.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.951
- Okay, you gotta stop following me.

05:30.080 --> 05:33.117
So how about | go this way,

05:33.250 --> 05:35.582
and you don't?

05:44.220 --> 05:45.585
(Nathan):
Why did you bring me here?

05:46.180 --> 05:47.636
I need to talk to Sandman.

05:47.765 --> 05:49.756
- Nathan, please,
just look around.

05:52.019 --> 05:55.227
Now, all these people are in Sandman's stasis
and they're okay.

05:55.356 --> 05:56.812
Audrey will be too.

05:56.941 --> 05:58.226
- That's not good enough.

05:58.359 --> 06:00.566
I need to hear it from him.
- He's with Dwight.

06:03.364 --> 06:06.106
- Sandman is supposed to be
working for The Guard.

06:06.242 --> 06:08.608
So why would he put Audrey out?
She's not a criminal.

06:08.744 --> 06:10.200
- Neither is her friend, Grayson.

06:10.955 --> 06:14.118
Which is why I think this whole thing
is just an innocent mistake.

06:14.250 --> 06:16.582
- He didn't seem like a guy
who makes mistakes.

06:17.211 --> 06:19.452
- Dwight will talk to Sandman
and he'll work this out.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.093
- So tell me what happened.

06:28.222 --> 06:29.837
Grayson, he's... he's deaf,

06:29.974 --> 06:32.716
so did you touch him
to get his attention?

06:34.812 --> 06:35.801
- No.

06:37.940 --> 06:40.807
- Did Audrey get in the middle
of an argument between you and Grayson?

06:44.905 --> 06:47.897
Come on, man.
l-l need some kind of explanation.

06:48.826 --> 06:51.659
You can't just roam around
accidentally putting people in stasis.

06:52.329 --> 06:54.285
(whispering): You're so sure
this was an accident.

06:54.748 --> 06:55.737
- What was that?

07:02.756 --> 07:04.087
Okay.

07:05.175 --> 07:08.542
How about you wake up Audrey now
and then we'll figure this all out?

07:08.679 --> 07:09.964
- No.

07:11.348 --> 07:12.849
I'm keeping her.

07:29.700 --> 07:31.110
Audrey?

07:34.788 --> 07:36.324
- This is wrong.

07:37.124 --> 07:39.866
No, you shouldn't...
You shouldn't be here.

07:43.172 --> 07:45.163
But I am so glad you are.

07:46.300 --> 07:48.256
(Audrey chuckling)

07:54.266 --> 07:55.597
(both laughing)

07:55.726 --> 07:56.715
Henry.

07:57.686 --> 08:00.177
- I couldn't wait any longer.

08:01.398 --> 08:04.060
How are you?
- Mortified.

08:04.193 --> 08:06.900
How dare you sneak up on me
a few hours before the wedding?

08:07.029 --> 08:10.317
It's bad luck. Now I'm going to have
to call the whole thing off.

08:24.046 --> 08:26.503
But that's all you get
until the honeymoon.

08:27.424 --> 08:28.413
- Deal.

08:28.926 --> 08:30.041
But after the wedding,

08:30.177 --> 08:32.042
you are mine forever.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.018
- Oh, my... God!

08:46.527 --> 08:49.314
- Haven, Maine.
Just think about it.

08:49.446 --> 08:51.937
- Okay.
So, you're stalking me now.

08:52.074 --> 08:54.156
- I'm not stalking you.
- No, it's okay.

08:54.284 --> 08:56.946
I understand, I mean...
I'm a founding Darkside Seeker.

08:57.079 --> 08:59.035
The occults can be very alluring.

08:59.957 --> 09:02.369
- Help me with this
and you'll never see me again.

09:02.501 --> 09:05.743
- All right, okay.
Help you with what?

09:05.879 --> 09:08.586
- You don't remember Haven?

09:08.716 --> 09:11.423
I need to know if that's permanent or not.
- Why?

09:11.552 --> 09:13.918
The last time we spoke,
you, uh, you made it sound

09:14.054 --> 09:18.343
like you never wanted to go back there.
- Because it's strange.

09:18.475 --> 09:20.682
- Yeah, not really.
You see, there is no Haven.

09:20.811 --> 09:22.347
It doesn't exist.

09:22.479 --> 09:23.855
I Googled it.

09:23.981 --> 09:26.267
- Ah-ha!
Which makes it really strange.

09:26.400 --> 09:29.767
And potentially dangerous.
- Yeah.

09:29.903 --> 09:33.236
- And you will have
the exclusive inside scoop.

09:33.365 --> 09:34.946
So what do you say?
Are you in?

09:51.967 --> 09:55.801
- These aren't gonna change anything.
- They already have.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.510
Hostage takers
don't work for The Guard.

09:57.639 --> 09:58.799
- What's my name?

09:59.600 --> 10:00.840
My real name.

10:01.351 --> 10:04.184
You can't fire me
if you don't know at least that.

10:04.313 --> 10:07.271
- You told me to call you Sandman.
- No.

10:08.317 --> 10:10.683
Your people told you
to call me Sandman.

10:11.528 --> 10:13.564
When I came to them for help,

10:14.156 --> 10:17.068
and you all decided
to use me instead.

10:17.201 --> 10:18.737
- What, so this is revenge?

10:18.869 --> 10:20.700
- No.
This is fair.

10:22.706 --> 10:25.698
Nobody has cared about me
since I got here.

10:27.878 --> 10:29.709
Except Audrey Parker.

10:31.381 --> 10:32.757
So I wanted her.

10:34.051 --> 10:35.882
And she's about to be all mine.

10:37.513 --> 10:38.719
- You're sick.

10:40.182 --> 10:42.047
- You people have called me way worse.

10:42.893 --> 10:45.885
- How long do you think you can keep her?
- Forever.

10:48.565 --> 10:49.850
Once she commits to me,

10:50.776 --> 10:53.267
which shouldn't be long now.

10:56.698 --> 10:59.110
- Dwight thinks that Sandman's
obsessed with Audrey.

10:59.743 --> 11:00.698
- Yeah.

11:02.538 --> 11:04.074
Well, so am |.

11:05.290 --> 11:06.791
I'm gonna stay right here.

11:06.917 --> 11:08.623
And I'm gonna keep talking to you.

11:10.045 --> 11:12.036
About our awesome life here.

11:13.465 --> 11:17.049
Bit of a disaster movie,
except it's real.

11:19.263 --> 11:20.343
But it's okay.

11:25.102 --> 11:26.763
lt's you and me.

11:29.982 --> 11:31.597
We're the heroes.

11:35.654 --> 11:37.144
- Greetings, Seekers.

11:37.281 --> 11:38.987
Welcome to Haven, Maine.

11:39.116 --> 11:40.856
As always, I’m Seth Byrne

11:40.993 --> 11:43.530
and we are the Darkside Seekers.

11:43.662 --> 11:44.822
Okay, what is this?

11:44.955 --> 11:48.664
You said I had footage of being in Haven
and all | see is snow, dude.

11:48.792 --> 11:50.373
There's no footage.

11:50.502 --> 11:52.743
- What are you talking about?
I'm looking right at it.

11:53.672 --> 11:57.460
That's you, investigating a Rougarou,
about to scream your head off.

12:03.140 --> 12:04.755
(sighs)

12:06.602 --> 12:09.344
You can't see it because you don't
have any memories of Haven.

12:09.479 --> 12:10.389
- All right.

12:10.522 --> 12:13.514
So I've got invisible notes
in my case log,

12:13.650 --> 12:15.811
l-l can't find the place
on a freaking map,

12:15.944 --> 12:18.651
and apparently, I can't even
remember the stupid mermen.

12:22.826 --> 12:25.283
- I didn't say anything about mermen.
- Oh, didn't you?

12:25.412 --> 12:27.744
Then how do I know
that I don't know anything

12:27.873 --> 12:30.615
about mermen who can only
breathe underwater during the Troubles?

12:33.754 --> 12:34.960
What the hell are the Troubles?

12:37.674 --> 12:39.790
- Seriously? A wedding?
Why?

12:39.927 --> 12:41.713
- Audrey will marry me.

12:41.845 --> 12:43.756
The ceremony is about to happen.

12:43.889 --> 12:46.881
Once she says "I do,"
her choice is made

12:47.017 --> 12:49.099
to accept me fully.

12:49.227 --> 12:54.893
And after that, I'll have her mine
for the rest of my life.

12:55.025 --> 12:58.734
- Why are you telling me all this?
- Because you can't do anything about it.

13:00.197 --> 13:01.687
And I enjoy that.

13:04.201 --> 13:07.193
- What if I forced my way
into your little fantasy world

13:07.329 --> 13:08.614
and tore it all down?

13:08.747 --> 13:11.830
- Nobody gets into my world
unless I want them to.

13:12.834 --> 13:14.040
You're not invited.

13:14.169 --> 13:15.875
- What if I grabbed you by the throat...

13:16.838 --> 13:20.922
and squeezed until this is all over?
- They're in my mind, Dwight.

13:22.844 --> 13:25.256
What do you think
will happen to them if I die?

13:26.056 --> 13:29.219
l wiped their minds
of the clutter and the anxiety.

13:29.935 --> 13:33.519
And I put them somewhere beautiful.

13:34.606 --> 13:38.224
- So once they're in your world,
you don't control them.

13:38.360 --> 13:40.976
- I can have complete control
if I want to.

13:41.697 --> 13:43.733
All l have to do is...

14:15.772 --> 14:18.104
You need to take attendance
in the sleep room.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.571
- You killed someone
because you felt like it?

14:26.700 --> 14:29.191
- Because you made me.

14:37.794 --> 14:39.625
- You may think
what you have is a power.

14:39.755 --> 14:41.461
- But what it is is a Trouble.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.756
There's always a downside.
And I'm gonna find it.

14:44.885 --> 14:47.672
I'm gonna use it against you
and get Audrey and the others back.

14:47.804 --> 14:52.639
- If you or someone else comes at me

14:52.768 --> 14:56.260
in a way that I do not like,
I'll rip them apart.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.721
Starting with Audrey Parker.

15:07.824 --> 15:10.110
You're gonna marry me,
Audrey Parker.

15:10.243 --> 15:11.983
- I can't believe this day is already here.

15:12.120 --> 15:15.487
lt's... it's all happening so fast.

15:15.999 --> 15:18.160
- Too fast?
- No.

15:18.752 --> 15:21.835
If it were up to me,
we'd already be married.

15:30.639 --> 15:32.800
(Audrey laughing)

15:37.187 --> 15:39.974
- There's my best man.
(laughing)

15:40.107 --> 15:41.972
About time, buddy.

15:42.109 --> 15:43.349
- Oh, Grayson.

15:44.486 --> 15:47.523
Oh! I'm so glad you could be with us
on this special day.

15:51.284 --> 15:52.660
- Cat got your tongue, buddy?

15:55.539 --> 15:59.157
- No.
Sorry, I think I'm just tired.

15:59.292 --> 16:00.748
- So tell me.

16:00.877 --> 16:03.789
How did you get this amazing band
for our reception?

16:03.922 --> 16:05.753
I heard that they've opened for U2?

16:05.882 --> 16:08.544
- You must be a man with connections
to get a band like that.

16:09.219 --> 16:11.050
- I... don't know.

16:11.721 --> 16:15.339
- Gear down,
no one wants to hear your demo.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.215
Come here, let's settle up.

16:23.817 --> 16:26.103
- So right over there...

16:26.236 --> 16:30.730
(choking)

16:35.078 --> 16:37.114
So glad you're here.

16:37.247 --> 16:40.114
I can't thank you enough.
- Yeah, the band kicks ass.

16:40.250 --> 16:42.115
And they can rock out a chicken dance.

16:42.252 --> 16:44.618
If the groom is as lame
as I remember him.

16:44.754 --> 16:47.621
- And you're still a jerk.
(laughter)

16:47.757 --> 16:52.046
Let's hit the bar. I'll get you your regular.
Espresso martini.

16:52.179 --> 16:54.545
- Not too many
espresso martinis.

16:54.681 --> 16:56.717
I don't want you
bouncing around for our vows.

16:56.850 --> 17:00.217
- All right, honey.
(Audrey laughing)

17:03.148 --> 17:05.605
- Memories are just buried
somewhere inside your head.

17:05.734 --> 17:07.895
We just need to shake them loose.
Okay, okay.

17:08.028 --> 17:12.021
I dragged you out of this cheese puff-filled
van to help me save Nathan.

17:12.157 --> 17:13.488
Nathan from the ghost world.

17:13.617 --> 17:16.484
You gave me one
of your little inventions.

17:16.620 --> 17:20.329
Some kind of device
that detected aether. Remember?

17:20.457 --> 17:22.994
- No, but whatever that is,
I'm gonna have to get that back

17:23.126 --> 17:25.913
because typically, I don't lend equipment
and that's not a personal thing...

17:26.046 --> 17:27.377
- Okay, forget the equipment.

17:28.632 --> 17:32.170
Something keeps
drawing you back to Haven.

17:32.302 --> 17:35.135
- I don't know.
- Something... specific.

17:35.263 --> 17:37.970
- I don't know.
- To the one memory that you have.

17:38.683 --> 17:40.674
The mermen.
Think.

17:40.810 --> 17:43.973
- I can't think! For Venkman's sake,
I don't have anything that I can...

17:46.107 --> 17:48.234
Wait a minute.
- What?

17:48.360 --> 17:50.396
- Holy crap, l-l-l saw one.

17:50.528 --> 17:51.654
- You saw one what?

17:53.907 --> 17:55.147
- When I was a kid.

17:55.784 --> 17:58.400
I saw one, a-a-a merman.

17:58.536 --> 18:00.822
I saw one.
- Okay.

18:01.331 --> 18:02.616
- That's incredible.

18:03.792 --> 18:06.659
(monster sounds from computer)
(Seth screaming)

18:06.795 --> 18:09.081
Mother of...
Okay.

18:09.965 --> 18:12.456
That is terrifying.
You're right.

18:12.592 --> 18:14.708
- But you can see it.
- Yeah.

18:14.844 --> 18:15.879
- That means you remember.

18:16.012 --> 18:17.513
- Uh, yeah.
Audrey.

18:17.639 --> 18:19.721
And Nathan, the Troubles.

18:19.849 --> 18:22.431
Me being awesome.
I don't know what it is.

18:22.560 --> 18:25.051
Maybe it's you getting
in my face that jarred it loose.

18:26.273 --> 18:28.059
We gotta go back there.
- Hang on, hang on.

18:28.191 --> 18:29.897
Let me...
Just let me think.

18:30.026 --> 18:31.982
- Think about what?
We gotta get back to Haven.

18:32.112 --> 18:34.603
We gotta figure out what's wrong,
what's blocking it from...

18:34.739 --> 18:35.945
- Shut up!

18:37.367 --> 18:39.699
Look, Haven...

18:40.203 --> 18:43.570
is a cancer
that I can't get out of me.

18:43.707 --> 18:45.322
Trust me, you don't want it.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.574
- What the hell have you been
forcing me to remember for?

18:47.711 --> 18:49.451
- I don't know.

18:50.005 --> 18:53.372
- You know what?
I think you do know.

18:53.508 --> 18:57.092
I don't think you're done with Haven.
I don't. I think you want closure.

18:57.220 --> 18:59.176
And I'll tell you something.

19:00.390 --> 19:04.349
I do know exactly
what we need to do next.

19:05.020 --> 19:06.681
And I think it might help you.

19:07.731 --> 19:09.062
Interested?

19:11.234 --> 19:13.816
- If she marries him,
she'll be trapped in his mind for good.

19:13.945 --> 19:15.481
- You have to let me go in.

19:15.613 --> 19:19.481
- Sandman's a maniac.
He'll strip you of everything you know.

19:19.617 --> 19:21.482
- Not if he doesn't
see me coming.

19:21.953 --> 19:25.445
If I surprise him
and push my way into his illusion,

19:25.582 --> 19:27.288
he might not have time
to alter my memory.

19:27.417 --> 19:29.624
- Not possible.
No one gets in unless he wants them.

19:29.753 --> 19:31.539
- Then I'll make him want me.

20:06.873 --> 20:08.579
Do you know who I am?

20:11.211 --> 20:12.997
- You're the CDC doctor.

20:14.172 --> 20:16.584
Who had no idea
what she was getting into

20:16.716 --> 20:18.331
when she came into Haven.

20:19.010 --> 20:23.253
- I wanted to see you for myself.
- You have a fetish for facial scars.

20:23.390 --> 20:27.850
- I have a fetish for spending
the rest of my life in paradise.

20:32.357 --> 20:34.268
- So you want my stasis?

20:43.868 --> 20:45.574
- I'm stuck in this town.

20:45.995 --> 20:47.531
Dodging Troubles
like my life depends on it.

20:47.664 --> 20:52.533
Everything else is rations
and hoarding toilet paper.

20:52.669 --> 20:54.284
- No, it's not very comfortable.

20:55.046 --> 20:56.661
- You have an escape.

20:57.549 --> 20:58.789
So why can't I?

20:58.925 --> 21:04.670
I heard about your world
and I think that it sounds amazing.

21:10.103 --> 21:12.344
- What makes you think
I'd give you paradise?

21:14.357 --> 21:16.814
I could make you
wander through the desert.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.225
Or throw you down a well.

21:22.240 --> 21:25.698
- Because you haven't been
with anyone like me.

21:28.997 --> 21:31.579
That's willing to be with you.

21:36.838 --> 21:39.921
(sighs)
- I can't.

21:42.343 --> 21:44.299
I love Audrey.

21:46.181 --> 21:48.888
- There can be more than
one queen in a castle.

21:53.688 --> 21:56.896
- I know the real reason
why you want me

21:57.025 --> 21:59.107
to welcome you in my mind.

21:59.444 --> 22:01.730
You want to take Audrey away from me.

22:09.829 --> 22:11.069
I won't let you.

22:20.089 --> 22:23.047
- As we both shall...
- Audrey?

22:23.176 --> 22:25.087
Audrey, I'm so glad I found you.

22:25.220 --> 22:26.801
It's important you listen to me.

22:26.930 --> 22:29.091
You need to remember that...

22:33.436 --> 22:36.143
(screams)

22:36.272 --> 22:39.309
You are gonna be a stunning bride.

22:39.442 --> 22:43.560
- And you are going to make
a gorgeous maid of honor.

22:44.322 --> 22:48.315
But you're late and we don't have
much time before the ceremony.

22:48.451 --> 22:49.952
Let's go.
- Come on.

22:50.078 --> 22:52.820
(giggling)

23:01.631 --> 23:04.168
- Thank you for helping me with these.

23:04.300 --> 23:06.757
I was afraid I was gonna see Audrey.

23:08.388 --> 23:09.377
Where is she?

23:09.889 --> 23:12.005
- She's down at my car
getting a worn out scrunchie

23:12.141 --> 23:13.597
from my glove compartment.

23:14.060 --> 23:17.644
She insisted.
It's old, borrowed, and blue.

23:17.772 --> 23:19.353
She'll wear it as a garter.

23:21.609 --> 23:23.986
But I guess you're what's new.

23:24.112 --> 23:25.898
It seems like you guys just met.

23:26.030 --> 23:29.488
And this wedding is just...
it's happening so fast.

23:29.617 --> 23:31.403
- I've been waiting for her all my life.

23:32.161 --> 23:34.652
And I'm not gonna let her
get away from me.

23:35.957 --> 23:37.663
- You guys are a great couple.

23:40.503 --> 23:43.245
- Can I show you something?
- Mm-hmm.

23:45.800 --> 23:49.088
Henry, those are gorgeous.
They're...

23:56.102 --> 23:57.137
- Charlotte?

23:58.104 --> 24:00.345
Charlotte?
(clapping hands)

24:00.481 --> 24:01.937
Charlotte!

24:07.196 --> 24:08.402
- I apologize.

24:09.282 --> 24:10.863
I don't know what came over me.

24:10.992 --> 24:13.984
- Neither do I.
But it's not cool.

24:14.454 --> 24:15.694
I got a lot going on.

24:15.830 --> 24:17.866
I'm juggling a lot and it's hard.

24:18.499 --> 24:21.206
Be present!
You're the maid of honor.

24:22.003 --> 24:24.039
This wedding has to go smoothly.

24:26.007 --> 24:27.713
So please,
just cooperate.

24:28.134 --> 24:29.374
- | Will.

24:29.886 --> 24:32.844
I'm... sorry I upset you, Henry.

24:46.903 --> 24:49.895
- Charlotte's tough.
She'll fight you to the end.

24:54.577 --> 24:57.193
- There isn't gonna be a wedding, Parker.

24:58.039 --> 25:00.325
Sandman thinks he's got you,
but he doesn't.

25:01.084 --> 25:03.621
This is a party trick
compared to what we've been through.

25:03.753 --> 25:08.247
Nothing that is happening
in Sandman's head is real.

25:11.219 --> 25:12.459
We're real.

25:12.595 --> 25:14.927
(laughs)

25:15.056 --> 25:18.548
- I'm just saying, it was weird.
He kinda just kept freaking out.

25:18.685 --> 25:21.893
- Well, Henry is...
He's sensitive.

25:22.021 --> 25:24.307
And grooms can get nervous too.

25:24.440 --> 25:26.055
- And then he walked out of here.

25:26.192 --> 25:29.650
- Because we have a wedding
in 15 minutes

25:29.779 --> 25:31.610
and he shouldn't be
in my dressing room.

25:31.739 --> 25:34.116
That's it.
- I don't know.

25:34.242 --> 25:36.654
Have you noticed, there's hardly
anyone here, no other guests?

25:36.786 --> 25:39.072
I just think that...
I mean, some of the staff

25:39.205 --> 25:41.070
might be disappearing.
(knock at door)

25:41.207 --> 25:42.117
- Come in.

25:45.795 --> 25:47.376
- Wow.

25:47.505 --> 25:48.836
(laughing)

25:48.965 --> 25:52.753
You look, um... Wow.
- Stop.

25:52.885 --> 25:54.841
- Wow.
- Stop it.

25:54.971 --> 25:58.088
That is so sweet.
I feel like, um...

25:58.224 --> 25:59.589
I feel like a princess.

26:00.643 --> 26:01.598
Oh!

26:02.270 --> 26:04.477
Promise.
Promise you won't be mad at me.

26:04.605 --> 26:07.472
But I really want you
to make a best man's toast.

26:10.653 --> 26:11.813
What?

26:12.613 --> 26:14.444
- It's tiny, it...

26:15.908 --> 26:19.366
It's just I don't think
I've ever had

26:19.495 --> 26:22.282
an espresso martini
before today.

26:25.668 --> 26:26.874
I don't...

26:27.003 --> 26:28.664
Are you sure you should be doing this?

26:28.796 --> 26:29.831
(laughing)

26:29.964 --> 26:33.047
- Because you had coffee
in your cocktail?

26:33.176 --> 26:34.837
- How well do you know this guy?

26:35.470 --> 26:37.677
- He's your best friend.

26:37.805 --> 26:41.343
- Audrey, I think we're just trying to say
it's just a really weird vibe.

26:41.476 --> 26:44.388
And I think Grayson and I
are maybe feeling the same thing.

26:44.520 --> 26:46.772
- Okay, stop.
I'm getting married.

26:47.607 --> 26:52.567
To the most wonderful man,
in less than 15 minutes.

26:52.695 --> 26:54.560
So, out, please.

27:02.371 --> 27:03.406
Unbelievable.

27:12.548 --> 27:14.334
- I love you.

27:15.301 --> 27:18.168
You fought so hard
to be who you are.

27:18.304 --> 27:22.297
I need you to remember.
Come back to me.

27:40.034 --> 27:43.322
- There he is.
Let's get this wedding started.

27:43.454 --> 27:46.196
- Whoa.
Why are you in such a rush?

27:46.332 --> 27:49.824
- It's only the date and time
engraved on the invitation, buddy.

27:49.961 --> 27:52.293
- I don't remember
getting that invitation.

27:53.297 --> 27:56.539
In fact, I don't remember us
growing up together.

27:58.052 --> 27:59.917
So why am I your best man?

28:00.054 --> 28:01.089
(light rock music)

28:01.222 --> 28:03.383
Whoa, whoa.
What is that?

28:05.184 --> 28:06.799
Is that music?

28:06.936 --> 28:10.144
- That's just the band you hired
doing a soundcheck.

28:10.898 --> 28:12.229
Forget about that.

28:12.358 --> 28:14.394
Let's go somewhere quiet
where we can talk.

28:18.781 --> 28:20.646
- For me, everywhere is quiet, right?

28:21.450 --> 28:22.986
At least it's supposed to be.

28:23.661 --> 28:26.027
There's no way for me
to have hired that band.

28:29.125 --> 28:32.583
I can't hear.
- You just had to push it.

28:34.088 --> 28:35.999
I got you out of that
sinkhole of a town.

28:36.132 --> 28:38.748
I gave you back your hearing.
That was a favor.

28:40.303 --> 28:42.589
- I don't want your favors.

28:44.056 --> 28:48.015
- Every time I bring someone
into this place, it costs me.

28:49.312 --> 28:50.927
I had no idea how much.

28:51.063 --> 28:54.647
It's so stressful
trying to keep you people happy.

28:54.775 --> 28:58.484
- Then put me back.

28:59.405 --> 29:01.896
Put us all back!

29:02.491 --> 29:06.029
- This is the new Haven.
Every man for himself.

29:06.787 --> 29:08.573
Audrey Parker is mine.

29:11.250 --> 29:16.836
(choking)

29:23.888 --> 29:27.130
- Come on, come on, come on.

29:33.147 --> 29:34.432
- Did you just see that?

29:35.524 --> 29:41.110
Grayson just... he...
What was that? What the hell just happened?

29:41.238 --> 29:42.774
- Audrey.
No, I remember.

29:42.907 --> 29:45.148
I... I remember what I wanted
to tell you so badly.

29:45.284 --> 29:46.524
- What?

29:46.661 --> 29:48.322
- You're in terrible danger.

29:49.872 --> 29:51.612
We both are.

30:04.845 --> 30:06.221
- You murdered Grayson.

30:07.056 --> 30:08.717
Are Charlotte and Audrey next?

30:09.183 --> 30:10.548
- If they fight me.

30:14.397 --> 30:16.308
- You've got a lot
of people up in there.

30:16.440 --> 30:18.931
And you don't have enough power
to control them.

30:19.068 --> 30:23.357
Grayson rejected you.
- Nobody rejects me in my world.

30:23.489 --> 30:25.275
- I bet they do in the real world.

30:30.246 --> 30:31.452
What happened to your parents?

30:34.417 --> 30:36.203
- There was a car accident.

30:41.340 --> 30:44.377
They got death certificates
and I got these.

30:45.344 --> 30:46.504
- An orphan?

30:48.097 --> 30:49.633
Now let me tell you the rest.

30:51.350 --> 30:53.386
An old relative took you in.

30:56.188 --> 30:57.473
Abused you.

30:58.566 --> 31:00.181
- I wouldn't let them.

31:00.860 --> 31:01.940
- Right.

31:02.945 --> 31:06.187
Well let's say... let's say
that there was no beatings.

31:06.323 --> 31:08.029
But you didn't have
any friends either.

31:08.159 --> 31:09.444
- Friends are fickle.

31:09.577 --> 31:12.910
- So little Henry created
his imaginary world.

31:13.831 --> 31:16.288
When he grew up,
he was able to trap people in it.

31:16.417 --> 31:17.452
It's kind of pathetic.

31:19.754 --> 31:21.961
- This is the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

31:22.798 --> 31:26.791
And I am going to push
my abilities to the limit.

31:28.179 --> 31:30.795
- You have no idea
what that Trouble's doing to you.

31:30.931 --> 31:32.387
- You don't care about me.

31:33.809 --> 31:37.347
You only care about
your girlfriend, Charlotte.

31:39.356 --> 31:41.142
Leave me alone.

31:42.526 --> 31:44.938
Or you will never
see her awake again.

31:48.324 --> 31:50.315
- You're crazy.
You're crazy.

31:50.451 --> 31:52.487
I think I would remember
if I helped people

31:52.620 --> 31:55.828
with their supernatural Troubles.

31:55.956 --> 31:58.368
- But that's what I'm trying
to get you to do.

31:58.501 --> 32:00.412
There's a whole town that needs you.

32:01.170 --> 32:04.628
Now I have a plan to end the Troubles.
But it'll take both of us.

32:06.008 --> 32:07.794
- That's a really high expectation.

32:07.927 --> 32:11.215
I like my life.
It's simple.

32:11.347 --> 32:14.464
Henry... Henry loves me.

32:14.600 --> 32:17.717
And he's...
Oh, he's perfect.

32:17.853 --> 32:20.936
- He's not your true love.
Nathan is.

32:21.065 --> 32:22.555
This isn't real.

32:23.984 --> 32:25.235
Where did you
and Henry meet?

32:25.361 --> 32:27.101
When did he propose?
How did you get here?

32:27.238 --> 32:30.071
- I... well...

32:30.825 --> 32:32.861
(Henry): Audrey?
Where are you?

32:38.707 --> 32:40.663
- Listen to me, Audrey.
We're running out of time.

32:40.793 --> 32:42.749
Henry can't know
that we're talking about this,

32:42.878 --> 32:44.584
or we'll both end up like Grayson.

32:46.841 --> 32:49.799
Now I know this will sound
impossible, but...

32:51.345 --> 32:54.837
I am your mother.
And I love you.

32:55.182 --> 32:56.513
We just found each other, dove,

32:56.642 --> 33:00.260
so... please try to remember.

33:01.272 --> 33:02.808
- My mother?

33:04.150 --> 33:05.890
- I haven't been treating you
like my child,

33:06.026 --> 33:08.062
and I'm sorry about that,
but I was scared.

33:08.195 --> 33:11.813
- If you were my mother,
I think I would remember you.

33:11.949 --> 33:15.817
- You don't remember me because
Henry took away your identity.

33:15.953 --> 33:18.114
People need you.

33:18.247 --> 33:19.453
I need you.

33:27.256 --> 33:29.497
(gaSDS)
Audrey?

33:33.929 --> 33:35.305
- Okay.

33:35.431 --> 33:38.798
You want to get rid
of the Haven inside of you?

33:38.934 --> 33:41.266
I might know how.
Foundit

33:41.937 --> 33:43.347
Check it out.

33:45.941 --> 33:47.977
- Man in North Carolina claims
he can remove

33:48.110 --> 33:51.477
the black tar of evil
from your soul.

33:51.614 --> 33:54.606
Black tar of evil.
Like aether.

33:55.868 --> 33:58.701
You think this is for real?
- I think it's worth a road trip.

33:58.829 --> 34:00.820
- All right, let's do it.
- Yeah?

34:00.956 --> 34:02.492
- Yeah.

34:02.625 --> 34:06.209
- I'm gonna run inside, get some snacks.
I'll be right back.

34:16.972 --> 34:19.133
(Duke): Okay.

34:20.684 --> 34:21.673
(Seth): Okay.

34:21.810 --> 34:23.346
Buddy?
Yeah,you.

34:23.479 --> 34:25.686
Unless you're checking your hair
in my side view mirror,

34:25.814 --> 34:30.057
I'm gonna have to ask you
to step away from the van, please.

34:31.362 --> 34:33.227
- No, I was waiting
for you to get snacks.

34:33.364 --> 34:34.695
Huh.

34:34.823 --> 34:36.734
I was wondering why
I was getting snacks.

34:36.867 --> 34:40.451
- Oh, come on.
You don't remember me again?

34:40.579 --> 34:42.865
- No, so if you just step away,

34:42.998 --> 34:45.205
otherwise I'm gonna
have to call the cops.

34:45.334 --> 34:47.575
- What the hell, you were gone for,
what, ten seconds?

34:47.711 --> 34:49.292
You didn't walk 100 feet away.

34:49.421 --> 34:50.627
- Okay, well you can walk away.

34:50.756 --> 34:52.212
And you know, you can feel free

34:52.341 --> 34:54.957
to go just way
further than 100 feet.

34:55.094 --> 34:58.131
- No, don't start the car.
Seth. Seth? Turn the car off.

34:58.264 --> 35:01.631
- I can't... sorry. I can't hear you.
It's a very loud car. No, sorry.

35:01.767 --> 35:04.429
- Just listen, listen, listen...
Listen!

35:08.357 --> 35:09.312
This sucks.

35:19.702 --> 35:22.865
(Nathan): Parker.
I know you can hear me.

35:23.706 --> 35:26.368
We can't talk Sandman down.
He's losing it.

35:27.084 --> 35:28.949
It's up to you.
The accident.

35:29.086 --> 35:30.747
What happened to him as a kid?

35:30.879 --> 35:33.370
Getting Troubled when Duke
exploded... use it.

36:06.915 --> 36:09.907
(soft music)

36:31.774 --> 36:33.639
- Nathan.

36:35.861 --> 36:37.192
- There you are.

36:43.494 --> 36:44.779
Let's do this.

36:46.121 --> 36:47.952
We need to get married.
Right now.

36:48.290 --> 36:49.450
- I can't.

36:52.461 --> 36:54.076
I remember everything now.

36:56.298 --> 36:58.004
I don't belong here.

36:58.634 --> 37:00.465
I'm in love with someone else.

37:05.349 --> 37:06.634
- No, you're not.

37:08.560 --> 37:09.970
And I'll make sure of it.

37:12.648 --> 37:15.640
(rock music)

37:17.319 --> 37:20.231
- Stop! Stop the van!
Stop! Wait!

37:20.364 --> 37:22.901
- What, what, what?
- Stop!

37:23.867 --> 37:26.074
What?
- Listen.

37:26.995 --> 37:29.407
- Oh, what is this?

37:29.998 --> 37:31.158
What?

37:31.500 --> 37:33.286
- Uh, 'cause I was...

37:33.419 --> 37:34.750
Yeah...

37:35.587 --> 37:38.795
We... are going to North Carolina.
- Oh, great.

37:38.924 --> 37:40.539
Great, we're going
to North Carolina.

37:40.676 --> 37:44.419
- And on the way, I'm gonna
tell you about Haven, Maine,

37:44.555 --> 37:46.591
a little town
that nobody can remember.

37:47.182 --> 37:49.719
A town with Rougarous
and mermen.

37:49.852 --> 37:51.388
You interested?

37:51.520 --> 37:53.681
- Haven?
Never heard of it.

37:54.940 --> 37:56.601
Why does it sound familiar?

37:56.733 --> 37:58.348
- I'll get to that part.

37:59.945 --> 38:01.276
In the meantime...

38:01.905 --> 38:03.236
Now.

38:03.365 --> 38:05.902
We've got snacks, supplies,

38:06.535 --> 38:08.366
and I am not
leaving your side.

38:08.745 --> 38:11.578
I am your new
best friend.

38:14.251 --> 38:16.708
Drive.
(rock music)

38:25.053 --> 38:26.213
- Henry?

38:27.139 --> 38:29.596
I know what it's like
to lose your parents.

38:29.725 --> 38:32.933
- Stop... no. I don't want to hear it.
It's not about them.

38:33.061 --> 38:36.224
- You can't force people
to live in your fantasy world.

38:36.815 --> 38:39.101
Give them a chance
to get to know you.

38:39.234 --> 38:41.395
Show them who you really are.

38:42.154 --> 38:43.564
- Don't you get it?

38:44.948 --> 38:46.609
This is who I really am.

38:49.995 --> 38:52.907
I'm strong enough now
to take what I really want.

38:56.502 --> 38:59.915
- You're not strong enough to keep me
from the people that I love.

39:00.923 --> 39:02.413
I will find a way out.

39:02.758 --> 39:04.589
And I will take
the others with me.

39:05.344 --> 39:06.584
- Stop it.

39:07.596 --> 39:09.132
- Let's go to Haven together.

39:10.307 --> 39:13.140
Don't let this Trouble ruin you.
- I'm already ruined.

39:13.268 --> 39:14.974
I kidnapped Audrey Parker.

39:15.771 --> 39:17.932
The woman who exists
to fight the Troubles.

39:18.649 --> 39:20.185
They won't forgive that.

39:21.068 --> 39:22.683
They'll execute me.

39:23.529 --> 39:26.692
- I will protect you.
- I don't want your protection.

39:28.951 --> 39:30.441
I want your love.

39:33.664 --> 39:37.282
You must feel something for me.

39:41.171 --> 39:42.627
-Ido.

39:44.967 --> 39:49.631
I-I feel sorry for you.

39:56.019 --> 39:58.510
Henry?
- Don't.

40:00.566 --> 40:02.272
I'll destroy this place,

40:02.401 --> 40:04.437
along with you
and everyone else in it.

40:04.570 --> 40:06.231
- I don't think you can.

40:07.030 --> 40:08.770
Your focus is split.

40:08.907 --> 40:10.818
You're losing control.

40:11.201 --> 40:14.910
I don't think you can
hold it together any longer.

40:15.581 --> 40:17.196
Look around.

40:18.917 --> 40:21.158
You're doing too much at once.

40:25.215 --> 40:27.501
You have to make a choice.

40:31.680 --> 40:34.342
Destroy us all or save yourself.

40:35.684 --> 40:39.017
I am... I am... I am Henry!

40:42.357 --> 40:43.893
This is my place!

40:47.446 --> 40:49.528
(panting)

40:52.200 --> 40:53.235
- You're back.

40:56.079 --> 40:57.865
- Because you never let me go.

40:58.582 --> 41:01.665
- Is that your way of telling me
you need some space?

41:01.793 --> 41:03.533
- Don't you dare.

41:04.254 --> 41:07.212
(folk music)

41:23.649 --> 41:24.638
- Dwight?

42:01.103 --> 42:02.513
- You went in there for me.

42:02.646 --> 42:04.307
And he could have killed you.

42:04.439 --> 42:05.599
- And I'd do it again.

42:06.858 --> 42:09.395
- I remember everything you said to me.

42:09.861 --> 42:11.522
- I meant every word.

42:13.198 --> 42:15.154
- I'm so glad you're my mother.

42:19.162 --> 42:20.993
- I'm so glad you came back to me.

42:21.623 --> 42:24.456
- Thank you for choosing me.
Thank you.

42:27.629 --> 42:29.415
But we have a lot of work to do.

42:29.548 --> 42:32.164
- I don't want anyone else
to end up like Henry.

42:33.218 --> 42:35.049
So we need to end the Troubles.

42:37.139 --> 42:38.424
Together.

42:39.891 --> 42:41.006
- Yeah.

43:02.330 --> 43:06.039
Subtitling: CNST, Montreal
