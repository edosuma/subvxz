WEBVTT

00:05.540 --> 00:07.280
Focus your feelings.

00:07.310 --> 00:11.080
Feel the Force flow through you.

00:11.110 --> 00:13.470
Let it surround you.

00:13.510 --> 00:17.510
When you master the Force,
then and only then

00:17.550 --> 00:22.510
will you be able to lead us
to the Kyber Saber crystals.

00:22.560 --> 00:25.360
Lightsaber!

00:25.390 --> 00:29.220
Oh.

00:31.330 --> 00:35.190
Rowan, you must concentrate.

00:35.240 --> 00:36.270
Sorry.

00:36.300 --> 00:39.230
We have theories as to where
Master Kantoo's Jedi

00:39.270 --> 00:41.200
hid the Kyber Saber crystals.

00:41.240 --> 00:43.140
But so does the Emperor.

00:43.180 --> 00:45.210
That's why you must focus
your abilities...

00:45.250 --> 00:47.220
So we can find them before he...

00:47.250 --> 00:48.450
Hey, asteroids.

00:48.480 --> 00:50.480
Yes, the Belgaroth
Asteroid Belt.

00:50.520 --> 00:52.450
Do you sense a crystal there?

00:52.490 --> 00:55.560
I don't know. Maybe.

00:55.590 --> 00:57.360
Yes!

00:57.390 --> 00:59.460
Then we'll go there first.

00:59.490 --> 01:01.320
- Go where?
- Nowhere.

01:01.360 --> 01:03.320
The Belgaroth Asteroid Belt.

01:03.360 --> 01:05.360
Aw, you told.
Now she's gonna say...

01:05.400 --> 01:07.270
No way.

01:07.300 --> 01:09.300
You are not taking
my little brother

01:09.340 --> 01:12.140
on some crazy-dangerous trip
to an asteroid belt

01:12.170 --> 01:13.316
or anywhere else,
for that matter.

01:13.340 --> 01:16.150
End of story.
See?

01:18.000 --> 01:24.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

01:26.290 --> 01:28.290
You don't understand.

01:28.320 --> 01:32.150
The hunt for the Kyber Saber
crystals is important. Waah!

01:32.190 --> 01:34.150
Not more important
than my little brother.

01:34.190 --> 01:37.220
We're talking about
the fate of the galaxy here.

01:37.260 --> 01:39.560
Rowan's destiny is calling him.

01:39.600 --> 01:43.170
Well, his destiny can leave a
message 'cause he's not answering.

01:43.200 --> 01:48.100
He'll be safe. A Jedi Master
always protects her Padawan.

01:48.140 --> 01:50.400
He'll be safe 'cause
he's staying right here.

01:50.440 --> 01:53.440
- Can I say something? -You
can't change my mind, Rowan.

01:53.480 --> 01:54.550
Aw.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.390
You will allow me
to take your brother

01:58.420 --> 02:00.420
to the Belgaroth Asteroid Belt.

02:00.450 --> 02:03.250
Did you just try
your mind trick thing on me?

02:03.290 --> 02:06.230
Uh... No.
There was a bug.

02:06.260 --> 02:08.330
There it is, see?

02:08.360 --> 02:11.120
You said that only worked
on the weak-minded!

02:11.160 --> 02:13.560
Are you saying
I'm weak-minded?

02:13.600 --> 02:16.170
No, I'm sure you say lots
of intelligent things.

02:16.200 --> 02:19.060
Wish I could
just do this myself.

02:19.110 --> 02:22.510
Try this. I followed the recipe,
but I don't have taste sensors.

02:22.540 --> 02:24.500
Do you love it?

02:24.540 --> 02:27.440
Blech. Ew. Burnt!

02:27.480 --> 02:31.320
Like we're gonna be if we don't
get outta here because...

02:31.350 --> 02:34.410
reactor leak!
Reactor leak?

02:34.450 --> 02:36.320
That'll melt my circuits
for sure!

02:38.290 --> 02:41.190
Do you know what the Jedi have
sacrificed for this galaxy?

02:43.360 --> 02:46.120
I'm sorry about leaving your
brother and sister behind,

02:46.170 --> 02:48.170
but as the last
of the battle droids,

02:48.200 --> 02:51.160
I must be preserved at all costs.
You understand.

02:51.200 --> 02:54.170
Don't sweat it, 'cause I kinda
lied about the reactor leak.

02:54.210 --> 02:55.540
Wait.

02:55.580 --> 02:58.410
What?

02:58.450 --> 03:02.050
Don't you ever pull your crazy
Force gibberish on me again!

03:02.080 --> 03:04.440
It's not gibberish!

03:04.480 --> 03:07.280
Aw, Rowan?
What did you break now?

03:07.320 --> 03:09.290
Oh, no, Zander.
That wasn't Rowan.

03:09.320 --> 03:12.280
Naare here had a little tantrum.

03:12.330 --> 03:14.300
For which I apologize.

03:14.330 --> 03:18.200
That was very...
Un-Jedi like.

03:18.230 --> 03:20.160
Where is Rowan anyway?

03:20.200 --> 03:22.240
Rowan?
Rowan!

03:22.270 --> 03:24.110
He's gone.

03:24.140 --> 03:25.540
One of the Z-wings
is missing.

03:25.570 --> 03:28.200
Hey, Roger!
Have you seen Rowan?

03:28.240 --> 03:30.500
- He's gone too.
- Oh, no!

03:30.540 --> 03:32.440
Rowan!
My Z-wing!

03:32.480 --> 03:35.550
Uh, I mean...
Oh, no! Rowan!

03:35.580 --> 03:37.410
Right?

03:37.450 --> 03:40.360
He must have gone to
the Belgaroth Asteroid Field.

03:40.390 --> 03:42.520
This is exactly what happens
when some crackpot

03:42.560 --> 03:45.490
fills a young, impressionable
head with foolish ideas!

03:45.560 --> 03:50.200
Kordi, this is awkward,
but your comlink's open.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.330
- I can hear you.
- Yeah. I know.

04:01.140 --> 04:03.040
An asteroid field?

04:03.510 --> 04:06.520
Why? Do you hate me?

04:06.550 --> 04:10.050
Haven't I been
a lovable companion?

04:10.080 --> 04:12.480
Calm down.
The ship will hold together.

04:12.520 --> 04:15.520
It's got the Freemaker
guarantee of quality.

04:15.560 --> 04:18.329
You are terrible
at reassuring me.

04:18.360 --> 04:19.529
Besides, I had to do this.

04:19.560 --> 04:25.330
The fate of the galaxy
is... at... stake.

04:25.370 --> 04:28.240
A Kyber Saber crystal.

04:28.270 --> 04:29.370
I sense it.

04:31.200 --> 04:35.130
Whoa. Like really sense it.
It's there.

04:37.240 --> 04:39.170
We're not the only ones here.

04:39.210 --> 04:41.070
We should go.

04:41.110 --> 04:42.510
No.
Aw.

04:48.190 --> 04:50.560
Come on. I've got a good
feeling about this.

04:50.590 --> 04:52.460
Really?
Based on what exactly?

04:52.490 --> 04:54.490
Whoa! Look at this!

04:57.460 --> 05:02.330
Ooh! This must be one of those illegal
Hutt mines I've heard spacers talk about.

05:02.370 --> 05:04.270
Okay, this was a nice day trip.

05:04.300 --> 05:06.200
Let's do it again sometime.

05:06.240 --> 05:08.240
Now you're going
to doubt me too?

05:08.270 --> 05:11.200
Relax. We go in.
We grab the crystal.

05:11.240 --> 05:13.210
We leap to hyperspace and...

05:13.250 --> 05:17.150
give... Naare...
the crystal.

05:17.180 --> 05:20.510
Hey! You see the big,
crushy thing, right?

05:20.550 --> 05:24.080
I... I-I know where it is.

05:24.120 --> 05:25.480
Rowan! Rowan!

05:27.490 --> 05:29.390
Yeow!

05:29.430 --> 05:31.330
That'll never buff out.

05:36.400 --> 05:39.260
Rowan! Snap out of it!

05:48.420 --> 05:51.320
The crystal, it's close.

05:51.350 --> 05:53.210
So close.

05:53.250 --> 05:55.150
Rowan!

05:55.190 --> 05:57.560
I hate that I'm so loyal.

05:59.230 --> 06:02.130
Rowan! That doesn't
go anywhere except...

06:03.160 --> 06:05.120
Down!

06:06.500 --> 06:09.070
The crystal...

06:15.440 --> 06:18.300
I got the crystal.

06:18.340 --> 06:20.440
Aaah! Now what?

06:20.480 --> 06:23.220
Excellent question.
Oh, boy.

06:23.250 --> 06:24.550
Roger?

06:24.580 --> 06:28.410
It's not that I don't have this
under control. I totally do.

06:28.460 --> 06:34.130
But if you <i>wanted</i> to help,

06:34.160 --> 06:36.230
now would be a good time.

06:36.260 --> 06:40.130
Really good!

06:41.300 --> 06:44.060
Thanks, Roger.

06:44.100 --> 06:46.060
Lucky for you,
I make friends fast.

06:51.110 --> 06:53.410
Thanks for the ride,

06:53.450 --> 06:55.480
If you're ever on the
Wheel, look me up!

06:55.520 --> 06:58.490
Look what I found...
A Kyber Saber crystal!

06:58.520 --> 07:00.490
By myself!
Sweet, right?

07:00.520 --> 07:02.460
Fantastic! Well done!
Can we leave now?

07:02.490 --> 07:05.460
Aw, man.
Naare will be so proud.

07:05.490 --> 07:08.390
What are you doing here?

07:15.370 --> 07:19.140
Okay. This will be,
um, challenging.

07:19.170 --> 07:21.170
Good news!
I like a challenge.

07:23.210 --> 07:25.050
Sometimes.

07:25.080 --> 07:29.050
Don't worry, Zander. We've got
a "magical Jedi" with us.

07:29.080 --> 07:31.510
<i>She'll "use the Force"
to find Rowan.</i>

07:31.550 --> 07:33.150
It isn't that simple.

07:33.190 --> 07:35.490
There are nuances
to how the Force works, and...

07:35.520 --> 07:38.420
So, you're admitting
you're basically useless?

07:38.460 --> 07:39.490
No!

07:42.400 --> 07:45.070
Okay, don't admit it.
I'm good with whatever.

07:46.570 --> 07:49.440
We're gonna have to find Rowan
the old-fashioned way...

07:49.470 --> 07:52.310
By looking.

07:52.340 --> 07:54.310
- What are you doing down here?
- Uh...

07:54.340 --> 07:57.380
Are you guys here to watch the
mining droids blow stuff up?

07:57.410 --> 07:59.350
- Um...
- That's why I'm here.

07:59.380 --> 08:02.280
Nobody likes watching stuff
blow up more than me.

08:02.320 --> 08:05.090
Whoa, Raam.
Why you gotta do that?

08:05.120 --> 08:07.160
You know I like it
more than you do.

08:07.190 --> 08:10.190
Baash, all I know
is you keep talkin',

08:10.220 --> 08:13.080
I'm gonna drop you
like a wet womp rat!

08:13.130 --> 08:15.130
Oh, you wanna butt horns?
Is that it?

08:15.160 --> 08:19.020
I'll knock you in the next quadrant!
Let's dance, you herded nerf!

08:21.530 --> 08:23.500
Gah!
Gah!

08:28.070 --> 08:30.300
What were we talking
about again?

08:30.340 --> 08:33.309
Uh, give me a minute.
It'll come to me.

08:33.350 --> 08:35.380
Oh, right. You two.
Who are you again?

08:35.419 --> 08:39.320
We're... bounty hunters.
We're what?

08:39.350 --> 08:43.220
I'm Grunt Boar, the galaxy's
most dangerous Ugnaught.

08:43.260 --> 08:45.330
And this is IG-89.

08:45.360 --> 08:47.300
What are you talking about?

08:47.330 --> 08:52.130
You've heard of IG-88,
the famous bounty hunter droid.

08:52.170 --> 08:54.170
Well, he's one better.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.140
Can't argue with the math.

08:56.170 --> 08:58.440
Anyhoo,
we're off to hunt some...

08:58.470 --> 09:02.000
bounties 'cause that's what
we bounty hunters do.

09:02.040 --> 09:04.400
- Bounty hunters?
- Not so fast!

09:05.510 --> 09:08.410
You gotta meet the boss!
He's gonna like you.

09:08.450 --> 09:11.390
Yeah! With you being such
dangerous bounty hunters and all.

09:11.420 --> 09:12.620
Come on.

09:12.650 --> 09:16.280
Does it seem to you like this
is going horribly wrong?

09:16.320 --> 09:18.320
'Cause it seems that way to me.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.960
Well, thank you, Jabba.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.060
When it comes to mining ore in the
middle of a desolate asteroid field,

09:33.110 --> 09:35.040
I'm your Hutt.

09:35.070 --> 09:38.000
And have been for two whole centuries now.
But who's counting?

09:43.980 --> 09:45.880
Yeah, about that.

09:45.920 --> 09:51.190
So I was thinking, maybe it's time
for me to move on to new challenges.

09:51.220 --> 09:52.820
New... New frontiers.

09:54.230 --> 09:58.200
Yeppau! Will you turn the...
Turn the thing, will you?

09:58.230 --> 10:01.130
We've been through thi... Just a minute.
He's getting it.

10:01.170 --> 10:02.200
Ha!

10:02.240 --> 10:05.040
May I present to you...
Hold it up...

10:05.070 --> 10:08.170
Graballa's Beachside
Resort and Buffet!

10:08.210 --> 10:10.980
I know you're a buffet guy.
Think about it.

10:11.010 --> 10:13.150
Sun and sand, fine dining.

10:13.180 --> 10:16.080
Maybe we get Max Rebo
and the gang to play a show?

10:16.120 --> 10:18.890
We'll make a fortune with this!

10:18.920 --> 10:21.990
Jabba, it's your old cousin
Graballa talking here.

10:22.020 --> 10:25.950
I'm only 462 years old.
I'm in the prime of my life.

10:25.990 --> 10:29.320
I can't keep floating around
on an asteroid field forever.

10:29.360 --> 10:31.890
I'm literally...
Watch my lips.

10:31.930 --> 10:33.860
I'm literally begging you.

10:33.900 --> 10:35.900
If I had knees, I'd use 'em.

10:41.370 --> 10:44.170
I'm wasting his precious time.

10:44.210 --> 10:47.080
Do you hear the way he talks to me?
Yep.

10:47.110 --> 10:51.010
Such disrespect. To his own cousin!
Yep.

10:51.050 --> 10:54.020
Does family mean nothing anymore?
Nope.

10:54.050 --> 10:55.180
Hey, boss!

10:55.220 --> 10:58.150
Oh, the think tank's here,
everybody.

10:58.190 --> 11:01.090
All right, nitwits.
What is it? Make it fast.

11:01.130 --> 11:03.060
Your mere presence
kills brain cells.

11:03.100 --> 11:05.070
We found new bounty hunters.

11:05.100 --> 11:08.900
- Wow. I've already got
a bounty hunter.

11:08.940 --> 11:12.940
- Okay, Dengar's
no Boba Fett, but...

11:12.970 --> 11:15.970
There's no "but." He's no Boba Fett,
but he's still a bounty hunter.

11:16.010 --> 11:19.850
Grunt here says he's the galaxy's
most dangerous Ugnaught.

11:19.880 --> 11:24.850
And IG-89 here
is one better than IG-88.

11:24.880 --> 11:27.110
A-Ask Baash about the math.

11:27.150 --> 11:29.080
It's math.

11:29.120 --> 11:33.250
I'm sure the one thing I'm never gonna ask
Baash about is math, but thanks for trying.

11:33.290 --> 11:35.220
I'll tell you what.

11:35.260 --> 11:40.130
You and, uh, bolt bucket here prove you're
faster, tougher and stronger than Dengar,

11:40.170 --> 11:42.040
you can have his job.

11:42.070 --> 11:45.010
- We're in!
- Uh, wait, uh, hold on!

11:45.040 --> 11:47.910
I'd like a moment
to confer with my associate.

11:49.110 --> 11:51.950
What are you doing?
We're not bounty hunters.

11:51.980 --> 11:54.350
I'm the most-beloved member
of a scrappy salvage team,

11:54.380 --> 11:56.890
and you're
my rapscallion sidekick!

11:56.920 --> 11:59.020
We'll argue
who's sidekicking who later.

11:59.050 --> 12:02.850
I mean, I just found
a Kyber Saber crystal!

12:02.890 --> 12:05.290
On my own.
On your own?

12:05.320 --> 12:07.890
That's how you remember it? Yes.

12:07.930 --> 12:12.230
So trust me when I say
we can take that guy.

12:14.200 --> 12:18.240
As I was saying,
Mr. the Hutt, we are in...

12:18.270 --> 12:21.100
Yah!

12:21.140 --> 12:22.210
Ooh! Oohie-boohie!

12:25.010 --> 12:27.140
- Wow!
- Whoa! Whoa!

12:33.920 --> 12:35.020
Whoa!

12:36.060 --> 12:38.960
Uh-oh.
Something's not right.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.960
Come on, Ugnaught.
Show me what you got.

12:44.960 --> 12:47.190
Little guy's got spunk!

12:47.230 --> 12:50.260
I'm coming, Rowan!
Ow!

12:50.300 --> 12:52.330
Hey! Cut it... out!

12:52.370 --> 12:55.100
Okay. Bored now.

13:03.180 --> 13:05.110
Ho! What have we here?

13:05.150 --> 13:08.050
Something valuable?

13:08.090 --> 13:11.060
Yep, yep and yep.

13:12.020 --> 13:13.920
What's happening?

13:13.960 --> 13:18.070
Did you lose the Kyber Saber crystal?
Aw, you just found that.

13:27.040 --> 13:29.910
I'm looking, Kordi, and you
know what I'm not seeing?

13:29.940 --> 13:31.840
Rowan. You know
what I am seeing?

13:31.880 --> 13:35.880
Rocks, rocks, rocks
and... ship parts?

13:35.920 --> 13:39.190
- From Rowan's Ugly? -Z-wing is
the preferred term, thanks.

13:40.250 --> 13:41.250
Our boy left a trail.

13:45.120 --> 13:49.090
A Kyber Saber crystal?
Sounds valuable.

13:49.130 --> 13:52.130
Not at all. It's a worthless pebble.
So here, give it to me.

13:52.160 --> 13:57.930
Right. You came all the way to the middle
of an asteroid belt for a worthless pebble.

13:57.970 --> 13:59.140
'Cause I was born yesterday.

13:59.170 --> 14:01.930
You're in over your head.
Let me handle this.

14:01.970 --> 14:03.900
Yes, that crystal is valuable.

14:03.940 --> 14:06.870
In fact, the Emperor is
collecting a complete set.

14:06.910 --> 14:09.870
So unless you want the most
powerful man in the galaxy...

14:09.920 --> 14:12.290
- Whoa, whoa. There's more than one?
- Yes.

14:12.320 --> 14:14.920
But did you hear the part
about the Emperor?

14:14.950 --> 14:17.180
I don't care about the Emperor!

14:17.220 --> 14:21.150
They're valuable.
So how do I get more?

14:21.190 --> 14:24.290
Oh, well, you just... Uh,
you, well... You handle it.

14:24.330 --> 14:28.070
Mr. the Hutt, sir,
we don't know.

14:28.100 --> 14:31.040
- We got lucky finding this one.
- So you won't talk?

14:31.070 --> 14:33.210
Fine. Smiley
will make you talk.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.980
That doesn't sound so bad.

14:36.010 --> 14:39.010
- He seems friendly.
- Well, that's not Smiley.

14:40.950 --> 14:43.890
That's Smiley!

14:45.020 --> 14:47.290
Oh. So the name
is ironic.

14:49.990 --> 14:53.260
You were right.
I am in over my head.

14:53.290 --> 14:56.290
It's not what's over your
head that concerns me.

14:56.330 --> 14:58.330
It's what's under it!

15:09.860 --> 15:11.000
There.
That's Rowan's Ugly.

15:11.030 --> 15:13.900
Oh, I thought
you called them Z-wings.

15:13.930 --> 15:17.770
No. After what he did to
it, it's definitely Ugly.

15:17.800 --> 15:20.770
- So where's Rowan?
- If I had to guess...

15:22.840 --> 15:27.610
I wanna keep it simple, 'cause I have
a hunch simple works best for you.

15:27.640 --> 15:31.710
Tell me how I get more of these
crystals, or join Smiley for lunch.

15:31.750 --> 15:33.650
We're doomed.

15:33.680 --> 15:36.610
Speak for yourself.
It's not gonna eat a droid.

15:36.650 --> 15:40.980
Wrong! I clean his litter box.
That kitty'll eat anything.

15:41.020 --> 15:42.950
Help! Somebody help!

15:42.990 --> 15:46.620
I'm the last of the battle droids!
Preserve me!

15:49.030 --> 15:53.860
Hey! Who's ready for
the bargain of a lifetime?

15:53.900 --> 15:56.930
You must be the head
honcho, the big Hutt.

15:56.970 --> 15:58.930
You radiate authority.

15:58.980 --> 16:00.810
That's true.
You're very perceptive.

16:00.840 --> 16:04.770
So, I'm betting you understand the
value of a great deal, am I right?

16:04.850 --> 16:05.850
Also true.

16:05.880 --> 16:07.840
Then you'll love this.

16:07.880 --> 16:12.710
Laser cannons made from
repurposed parts, good as new.

16:12.760 --> 16:14.730
Show 'em, Zander!

16:17.690 --> 16:19.620
Oops.
Did you like that guy?

16:19.660 --> 16:21.660
I mean, he's all right,
but that thing... wow!

16:24.700 --> 16:27.970
After just one shot, a new
weapon depreciates in value.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.630
That's pure financial loss.

16:31.670 --> 16:34.900
Why pay inflated dealer prices?

16:34.940 --> 16:36.970
It's a good question.
Why?

16:37.010 --> 16:38.870
Wait, my friend.

16:38.910 --> 16:41.880
If you like that, then
you'll love what's next.

16:44.950 --> 16:45.950
Hey.

16:45.990 --> 16:48.830
You want to take a nap.

16:48.860 --> 16:51.960
We want to take a nap.

16:51.990 --> 16:54.690
Minds don't come
any weaker than that.

16:57.870 --> 16:59.800
Shh!

16:59.840 --> 17:01.810
It's that simple.

17:01.840 --> 17:05.810
A high-quality ship befitting an intergalactic
legitimate businessman of your stature.

17:05.839 --> 17:07.740
- This Ugly...
- Z-wing.

17:07.780 --> 17:11.619
Not the time. This ship can be yours
for a mere 20 credits a month

17:11.650 --> 17:13.579
for 36 months, zero down,
financing available.

17:13.619 --> 17:15.650
So, what do you say?
Deal?

17:15.680 --> 17:17.579
No deal.

17:17.650 --> 17:20.980
But that was a decent distraction while
your friend over there freed the kid.

17:21.020 --> 17:23.579
- Are we home yet?
- Smiley's eatin' well tonight!

17:23.630 --> 17:25.900
Uh, we'll show ourselves out.

17:25.930 --> 17:27.000
Now, Zander!

17:30.930 --> 17:31.990
Ah, it's windy!

17:33.870 --> 17:35.970
Whoa!

17:36.010 --> 17:38.740
The crystal!
Grab on, Roger!

17:38.770 --> 17:40.900
Don't leave me!

17:40.940 --> 17:43.740
Ooh-hoo!

17:47.850 --> 17:51.760
Wish I hadn't seen that.
I'll need a memory wipe.

17:51.790 --> 17:54.590
Ugh! Release the swarm!

18:02.570 --> 18:03.700
We got company.

18:04.730 --> 18:08.660
Hey! Fly faster!
Faster!

18:10.970 --> 18:13.530
The shield couplers.

18:16.650 --> 18:18.850
Ugh!

18:23.950 --> 18:27.850
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
Hey! Thanks.

18:27.890 --> 18:29.830
Oh!

18:33.830 --> 18:34.900
Yippee!

18:41.840 --> 18:42.840
The Force.

18:48.680 --> 18:49.750
Whoa.

18:51.680 --> 18:54.020
Whoo-hoo! Yeah! Ha-ha!

19:03.030 --> 19:07.630
Okay, maybe there is a little
something to this Jedi business.

19:07.660 --> 19:10.630
Yeah. Whoo!
She's completely amazing.

19:10.670 --> 19:13.540
- I didn't say that.
- I did though.

19:17.910 --> 19:21.850
Sorry, guys. I never meant
to cause so much trouble.

19:21.880 --> 19:24.020
Trouble?
Was there trouble, Zander?

19:24.050 --> 19:26.920
Well, Kordi, our brother
did steal one of our ships.

19:26.950 --> 19:28.850
We'll never see that again.

19:28.880 --> 19:31.780
- Oh, yeah, flew it into an asteroid field.
- He's lucky to be alive.

19:31.820 --> 19:33.720
Wound up face-to-face
with a Hutt.

19:33.760 --> 19:35.790
Make that super lucky
to be alive.

19:35.820 --> 19:39.750
Then he forced us to do all the
same things to save his sorry hide.

19:39.800 --> 19:41.630
Right.

19:41.660 --> 19:43.790
So, yeah, I guess
there was some trouble.

19:43.830 --> 19:47.600
But it was all worth it to get
you back, little brother.

19:48.670 --> 19:49.730
Yeah.

19:49.770 --> 19:53.600
Still, do not run off
like that again, ever!

19:53.640 --> 19:56.000
You hear me?
I do, Kordi.

19:56.050 --> 20:02.050
The person I really owe
an apology to is Naare.

20:02.080 --> 20:06.950
Master, I had a Kyber
Saber crystal in my hand,

20:06.990 --> 20:10.600
<i>and then I lost it
in an asteroid field.</i>

20:10.630 --> 20:13.000
Now you'll never collect
all the crystals.

20:13.030 --> 20:16.030
I've ruined
all your plans forever.

20:16.070 --> 20:19.940
There's no way anybody
could ever fix this.

20:19.970 --> 20:23.810
<i>It's all my fault,</i>

20:23.840 --> 20:26.910
and all I can say is...

20:26.940 --> 20:29.740
I know where it is!
Rowan!

20:43.690 --> 20:46.690
Found it! I found
the Kyber Saber crystal!

20:46.730 --> 20:50.770
Oh, Rowan, all is forgiven.

20:50.800 --> 20:53.740
Again.
For the second time today!

20:53.770 --> 20:55.810
Who's got two thumbs...

20:55.840 --> 21:00.680
Uh, two hands and has the
Force flowing through him?

21:00.710 --> 21:03.010
This guy right here!

21:03.050 --> 21:04.680
Yeah!

21:09.620 --> 21:11.020
All right, listen up.

21:11.050 --> 21:15.580
Those crystals are worth so much,
the Emperor himself wants them.

21:15.620 --> 21:17.020
The Emperor!

21:17.060 --> 21:22.000
If I get them first, then
maybe I become more powerful

21:22.030 --> 21:25.990
than a certain slime-sucking
cousin of mine!

21:26.040 --> 21:28.670
- We all know I'm talking
about Jabba, right? -Yep.

21:28.700 --> 21:33.070
But them crystals could be
anywhere in the galaxy.

21:33.110 --> 21:35.050
In the galaxy, boss!

21:35.080 --> 21:39.020
And the galaxy
is, like... big.

21:39.050 --> 21:41.090
I don't know how
we find the crystals.

21:41.120 --> 21:44.620
But I know who does.

21:45.120 --> 21:47.020
That kid.

21:47.060 --> 21:48.820
Find him, whoever he is,
and bring him to me.
