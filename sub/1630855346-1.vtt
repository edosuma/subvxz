01:27.689 --> 01:29.857
Mr. and Mrs. Gibbs,
I think I have someone here

01:29.891 --> 01:31.726
you might like to meet.

01:31.759 --> 01:33.728
Well, lookie here, Alice.

01:34.662 --> 01:36.898
Oh, you must be Becky!

01:36.931 --> 01:38.833
Nice to meet you,
Mr. and Mrs. Gibbs.

01:38.866 --> 01:42.369
Oh, please call us
Ted and Alice.

01:42.402 --> 01:45.138
And this is Diego, right?

01:45.172 --> 01:46.841
That's right.

01:47.942 --> 01:49.343
Welcome home, honey.

01:49.376 --> 01:50.745
Welcome home.

01:53.480 --> 01:54.749
<i>I know what</i>
<i>you're thinking.</i>

01:54.782 --> 01:56.684
<i>"Who the fuck is this girl?</i>

01:56.718 --> 01:59.252
<i>That is not the Becky</i>
<i>I remember."</i>

01:59.286 --> 02:02.824
<i>But I had to play the part</i>
<i>for my new foster parents.</i>

02:02.857 --> 02:05.158
<i>Yeah, these two wackjobs.</i>

02:10.197 --> 02:11.799
You know,
when Alice and I decided

02:11.833 --> 02:13.367
we were gonna be foster parents,

02:13.400 --> 02:15.369
we knew we had to move
to a community

02:15.402 --> 02:18.806
with the best of the best
in Christ-filled education

02:18.840 --> 02:22.910
and around here they're all
blue ribbon school districts.

02:22.944 --> 02:26.781
Top tier, top of their class,
and top notch.

02:26.814 --> 02:29.349
Well, I'm not sure what all
is planned for tomorrow

02:29.383 --> 02:31.786
but I would love
to get enrolled ASAP.

02:31.819 --> 02:34.388
Absolutely.
I planned on taking you there

02:34.421 --> 02:35.757
first thing in the morning.

02:35.790 --> 02:36.824
Wonderful.

02:36.858 --> 02:38.593
Oh, oh, and don't forget about
the new principal.

02:38.626 --> 02:40.260
- Mr. Serio.
- Good guy.

02:40.293 --> 02:41.729
We've gone to the same church
now for what?

02:41.763 --> 02:42.764
Six years!

02:42.797 --> 02:44.599
And he has a daughter
that's your age, Sarah.

02:44.632 --> 02:45.399
She's adorable.

02:45.432 --> 02:46.601
She'll probably
be in your class.

02:46.634 --> 02:47.835
She is in a wheelchair

02:47.869 --> 02:50.203
but you'll still like her
anyway.

02:50.237 --> 02:50.872
Well, will I get
to spend time

02:50.905 --> 02:51.939
with her in church as well?

02:51.973 --> 02:54.809
Perhaps there's like
a youth group of some sort.

02:54.842 --> 02:56.711
- Oh, Becky.
- Wow.

02:56.744 --> 02:58.813
I can't tell you
how happy it makes me

02:58.846 --> 03:00.414
to hear you say that.

03:00.447 --> 03:01.916
Well, shall we?

03:01.949 --> 03:04.819
Yes, um, it's just...

03:04.852 --> 03:06.954
would you mind
if we said grace first?

03:10.357 --> 03:11.959
-Can you believe it?
-She's perfect.

03:15.596 --> 03:18.533
And just remember,
if you need anything at all,

03:18.566 --> 03:20.702
Ted and I are just
in the next room.

03:20.735 --> 03:23.538
My guardian angels.

03:30.745 --> 03:32.547
Goodnight, sweetheart.

03:32.580 --> 03:34.381
Goodnight, Mom.

03:36.017 --> 03:38.019
Ted!
Teddy!

03:49.664 --> 03:51.766
Diego, come.

05:40.942 --> 05:43.511
<i>It's been two years</i>
<i>since four Neo-Nazis</i>

05:43.544 --> 05:46.681
<i>invaded my family's lake house</i>
<i>and murdered my father.</i>

05:46.714 --> 05:48.783
<i>They were looking</i>
<i>for some stupid fucking key</i>

05:48.816 --> 05:51.484
<i>that they had hidden</i>
<i>below the house.</i>

05:51.519 --> 05:52.720
<i>Yeah.</i>

05:52.753 --> 05:55.723
<i>That stupid fucking key.</i>

05:55.756 --> 05:57.792
<i>But then, this happened.</i>

06:03.998 --> 06:06.567
<i>Bummer about me</i>
<i>ruining their plans.</i>

06:09.604 --> 06:10.671
<i>I'm sixteen now.</i>

06:10.705 --> 06:13.174
<i>I've run away from</i>
<i>three foster homes.</i>

06:13.207 --> 06:16.978
<i>I've manipulated,</i>
<i>conned, burglarized,</i>

06:17.011 --> 06:18.913
<i>anything to keep me</i>
<i>off the grid</i>

06:18.946 --> 06:20.615
<i>and out of the system.</i>

06:20.648 --> 06:23.084
<i>If you ask me,</i>
<i>given the circumstances,</i>

06:24.752 --> 06:26.687
<i>I think I'm doing just fine.</i>

06:57.618 --> 07:01.454
<i>Oh yeah, I fall into</i>
<i>my own hole traps sometimes.</i>

07:01.488 --> 07:03.456
<i>Nobody's perfect.</i>

07:18.973 --> 07:20.608
Eat.

07:20.641 --> 07:22.777
Thank you, darlin'.

07:22.810 --> 07:24.211
<i>This is Elena Cahn.</i>

07:24.245 --> 07:26.847
<i>I've lived with her</i>
<i>for the past year.</i>

07:26.881 --> 07:28.115
<i>I don't know much about her</i>

07:28.149 --> 07:29.951
<i>other than the following:</i>

07:29.984 --> 07:33.254
<i>She's old,</i>
<i>she hates almost everyone,</i>

07:33.287 --> 07:35.556
<i>and she picks up hitchhikers.</i>

07:35.589 --> 07:36.991
<i>It's how we met.</i>

07:37.024 --> 07:39.627
I fell into one
of my hole traps again today.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.562
I saw that.

07:41.595 --> 07:43.531
I had just woken up,

07:43.564 --> 07:45.533
looked out my window

07:45.566 --> 07:48.269
just in time to see you vanish.

07:48.302 --> 07:50.972
I quite enjoyed the show.

07:55.643 --> 07:56.711
You sleep?

07:58.980 --> 08:00.681
No.

08:02.183 --> 08:04.719
<i>It's the same every night.</i>

08:19.633 --> 08:20.868
What about you?

08:22.003 --> 08:23.804
Like a baby.

08:26.640 --> 08:27.908
Well?

08:28.876 --> 08:30.277
I always start.

08:30.311 --> 08:32.813
So what's
different about today?

08:34.782 --> 08:37.018
I am grateful for food.

08:40.054 --> 08:42.923
I am grateful
for a hot cup of coffee.

08:42.957 --> 08:45.960
How come I can't say food
but you can say coffee?

08:45.993 --> 08:49.030
Food is a human necessity.

08:49.063 --> 08:52.166
Coffee is a delicacy.

08:54.802 --> 08:57.738
I am grateful that
I get paid today.

08:57.772 --> 08:58.639
Hmm.

09:00.674 --> 09:04.145
I am grateful
for the novel I'm reading.

09:04.178 --> 09:06.180
What's it called?

09:06.213 --> 09:08.649
True Grit.

09:08.682 --> 09:10.618
I think you'd like it.

09:12.053 --> 09:15.089
I am grateful for Diego.

09:15.122 --> 09:17.558
Hm. He's a good boy.

09:18.859 --> 09:19.927
One more.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.629
Wow me.

09:23.130 --> 09:26.634
I am grateful...for...

09:26.667 --> 09:28.569
Another day.

09:29.270 --> 09:30.771
...another day.

09:30.805 --> 09:32.173
You know, there should
really be a rule against you

09:32.206 --> 09:34.208
always saying that
as your number three.

09:34.241 --> 09:35.776
You only have to think
of two things

09:35.810 --> 09:37.378
if it's always
your number three.

09:37.411 --> 09:39.914
I get to change the rules.

09:39.947 --> 09:41.115
I'm old.

09:48.956 --> 09:51.859
Founding Fathers Breakfast
with a side of toast.

09:51.892 --> 09:53.894
Thanks, sweetheart.

09:56.197 --> 09:57.865
Do you see my name tag?

09:57.898 --> 10:00.134
-I'm sorry?
-My name tag.

10:00.167 --> 10:02.103
Does it say "Sweetheart"?

10:02.136 --> 10:03.671
No.

10:03.704 --> 10:05.673
What does it say?

10:05.706 --> 10:06.941
Becky.

10:06.974 --> 10:09.910
Yeah, 'cause that's my name.

10:09.944 --> 10:12.680
Okay, Jesus.

10:12.713 --> 10:15.616
Oh, sweetheart--Becky...

10:16.317 --> 10:18.252
I asked for buttered toast.

10:18.285 --> 10:20.187
There's butter on the plate.

10:20.221 --> 10:23.724
Yeah, but...I like the butter
to be melted into the toast

10:23.757 --> 10:26.827
the minute it pops
out of the toaster.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.279
<i>I didn't actually do it.</i>

10:45.312 --> 10:46.947
Hello?

10:46.981 --> 10:50.684
<i>But I really, really wanted to.</i>

11:01.996 --> 11:03.364
Shit.

11:26.954 --> 11:29.123
<i>A Jasper Hills man</i>
<i>is now facing</i>

11:29.156 --> 11:30.858
<i>first degree murder charges.</i>

11:30.891 --> 11:37.231
K-I-L-L-E-R.

11:38.299 --> 11:42.069
Double E, Double Word,
twenty-two.

11:44.138 --> 11:47.241
You can tell a lot
about a person,

11:47.274 --> 11:49.777
playing a game like this.

11:52.246 --> 11:54.014
How so?

11:54.048 --> 11:56.784
By the words they're able
to find within their letters.

11:59.920 --> 12:02.356
My brother made every effort

12:02.389 --> 12:05.092
to play the most ostentatious
of words.

12:05.125 --> 12:08.429
He was a real
self-righteous jackass.

12:08.462 --> 12:11.465
Two Triple Letters,
ten points.

12:14.802 --> 12:16.136
I didn't know
you had a brother.

12:16.170 --> 12:18.506
Four brothers,
all older.

12:18.540 --> 12:20.341
Do you still talk to them?

12:22.142 --> 12:24.178
Only one is still alive.

12:26.046 --> 12:28.015
The jackass.

12:30.518 --> 12:32.820
I'm sorry.

12:32.853 --> 12:34.255
You didn't kill 'em.

12:34.288 --> 12:35.889
Besides, I've learned that

12:35.923 --> 12:37.925
for every person
you lose along the way,

12:37.958 --> 12:40.227
you gain another.

13:00.180 --> 13:01.348
Anew.

13:03.117 --> 13:04.385
Ten.

13:08.523 --> 13:11.992
Why have you never asked me
where I came from?

13:12.026 --> 13:14.161
Why have you never told me?

13:14.194 --> 13:15.896
Weren't you curious?

13:15.929 --> 13:17.865
A kid with no parents
showed up

13:17.898 --> 13:19.800
wanting to rent a room.

13:20.635 --> 13:22.369
You pay your way.

13:22.403 --> 13:24.972
You help out around the house.

13:25.005 --> 13:27.575
And I'd hardly consider
you a child.

13:27.609 --> 13:30.311
You are eighteen, right?

13:34.982 --> 13:37.985
My mother died
when I was nine.

13:38.018 --> 13:39.853
My father was a drunk.

13:39.887 --> 13:42.156
I left home when I was fifteen.

13:42.189 --> 13:45.292
We all come from somewhere.

13:45.326 --> 13:48.462
And we all do
what we have to...

13:52.266 --> 13:54.335
...in order to survive.

13:56.638 --> 13:58.606
How much does that add up to?

14:01.141 --> 14:02.076
<i>Fifteen.</i>

14:02.109 --> 14:03.177
Ten.

14:10.417 --> 14:12.520
Nice try.

14:12.554 --> 14:14.455
<i>We go now to</i>
<i>a developing story.</i>

14:14.488 --> 14:16.323
<i>They call themselves</i>
<i>the Noble Men</i>

14:16.357 --> 14:18.325
<i>and they may be coming</i>
<i>here to Fillmore.</i>

14:18.359 --> 14:19.460
<i>Authorities are aware</i>

14:19.493 --> 14:20.994
<i>of the risk of violence</i>
<i>at this week's--</i>

14:21.028 --> 14:22.963
The world has gone mad.

14:22.996 --> 14:23.997
<i>...increasing</i>
<i>the security detail</i>

14:24.031 --> 14:26.133
<i>for Senator Anne Hernandez.</i>

14:26.166 --> 14:27.901
<i>They say they've been tracking</i>
<i>the Noble Men</i>

14:27.935 --> 14:30.137
<i>on various online platforms</i>
<i>for months now.</i>

14:30.170 --> 14:31.438
<i>They have seen a rise</i>
<i>in activity</i>

14:31.472 --> 14:33.307
<i>and they've noticed</i>
<i>a pattern of their appearances</i>

14:33.340 --> 14:34.709
<i>within smaller communities.</i>

14:34.743 --> 14:37.044
<i>Whether or not the Noble Men</i>
<i>decide to make an appearance</i>

14:37.077 --> 14:38.912
<i>at the town hall</i>
<i>in Fillmore on Wednesday</i>

14:38.946 --> 14:40.447
<i>and what that appearance</i>
<i>may look like</i>

14:40.481 --> 14:43.050
<i>only time will tell.</i>

15:11.311 --> 15:13.113
So are you gonna seat us
or you just gonna stand there?

15:13.147 --> 15:15.115
Yeah, wait, real quick,
I got a question.

15:15.149 --> 15:18.085
Um, did your mom
actually name you that?

15:18.118 --> 15:19.987
'Cause Becky is a stripper name

15:20.020 --> 15:22.524
and any chick that gives
her daughter a stripper name

15:22.557 --> 15:24.191
is a catch.

15:24.224 --> 15:25.727
What is it with you and moms?

15:25.760 --> 15:28.395
-I got a thing for moms.
-No, what he's saying is

15:28.429 --> 15:29.531
he'd love to fuck your mom.

15:29.564 --> 15:33.000
That is correct, yes,
I would love to fuck your mom.

15:34.468 --> 15:36.103
Right this way.

15:36.671 --> 15:37.739
Not a fan.

15:37.772 --> 15:38.573
Come on.

15:41.308 --> 15:42.209
I'm just saying
it's weird.

15:42.242 --> 15:43.143
Okay, I have a bad feeling.

15:43.177 --> 15:45.312
I just want to make sure
it's just a rally.

15:45.345 --> 15:48.449
Sean, can you
do me a favor?

15:48.482 --> 15:50.652
Just reach into your panties

15:50.685 --> 15:53.755
and pull the blood-soaked tampon
from your twat.

15:53.788 --> 15:55.757
Would you
shut the fuck up, dude?

15:55.790 --> 15:57.458
Can you?

15:57.491 --> 15:59.493
Look, Darryl will tell us
what we need to know

15:59.527 --> 16:01.061
when we need to know it.

16:01.094 --> 16:03.030
Darryl is a username
on a message board.

16:03.063 --> 16:04.331
You've never met him,
none of us have.

16:04.364 --> 16:05.633
He's an ex-Navy SEAL.

16:05.667 --> 16:07.468
He's one of the fucking
Founding Fathers, bro.

16:07.502 --> 16:08.736
How do you know he's not
an undercover cop?

16:08.770 --> 16:09.737
Oh, my God.

16:09.771 --> 16:11.472
Seriously, those guys
are on the message board

16:11.506 --> 16:13.006
all the time, right?

16:13.040 --> 16:14.475
Seriously, pull it out.

16:14.509 --> 16:15.777
You're gonna get
Toxic Shock Syndrome.

16:16.811 --> 16:19.246
That's a real killer,
you know that, right?

16:19.279 --> 16:21.281
Look, guys,
I hate Senator Hernandez

16:21.315 --> 16:22.784
as much as you guys do, okay?

16:22.817 --> 16:24.552
I hate her.

16:24.586 --> 16:26.521
But if shit goes south tomorrow,

16:26.554 --> 16:28.590
I ain't going to prison
like those jackasses last year.

16:28.623 --> 16:31.391
Is it weird, hating bitches
as much as you do

16:31.425 --> 16:33.026
but also being one?

16:33.060 --> 16:35.162
He's not wrong.

16:35.195 --> 16:37.297
Hey! Hello? Yeah.

16:37.331 --> 16:39.166
Could we get some coffee
over here, today?

16:39.199 --> 16:40.668
Coming right up.

16:40.702 --> 16:42.504
Why does everything
have to be like that with you?

16:42.537 --> 16:44.539
You could just say like,
"Excuse me."

16:44.572 --> 16:47.074
<i>I fantasize a lot</i>
<i>about the things I'd like to do</i>

16:47.107 --> 16:49.209
<i>to the people who piss me off.</i>

16:49.243 --> 16:50.678
<i>I've always had</i>
<i>an active imagination</i>

16:50.712 --> 16:52.680
<i>but it's really gone</i>
<i>into overdrive</i>

16:52.714 --> 16:55.315
<i>these last couple of years.</i>

16:55.349 --> 16:57.819
All right, finally.

16:57.852 --> 16:59.319
Thank you.

17:00.822 --> 17:02.189
Wonderful presentation.

17:02.222 --> 17:03.791
-You are doing great.
-Thank you.

17:03.825 --> 17:06.694
<i>But this one</i>
<i>wasn't a fantasy.</i>

17:06.728 --> 17:08.530
Oh, shit!

17:08.563 --> 17:10.565
- Fuck!
- Oh my God.

17:10.598 --> 17:13.635
-Are you fucking stupid?
-I am so sorry.

17:13.668 --> 17:16.103
You stupid fucking bitch!

17:16.136 --> 17:18.171
-Let me go get you a towel.
-Yeah, you fucking do that.

17:18.205 --> 17:20.207
Get the fuck outta here.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.142
Burned the shit outta
my goddamn crotch.

17:22.175 --> 17:23.110
It's okay, it's okay.

17:23.143 --> 17:24.546
Get the fuck aw--

17:24.579 --> 17:25.747
-You want us to fan you?
-No, no, stop.

17:25.780 --> 17:27.414
Would you two
shut the fuck up?

17:27.447 --> 17:28.215
Shut up!

17:40.895 --> 17:43.565
She did that shit on purpose.

17:43.598 --> 17:46.166
Who cares, dude?
She's just a little girl.

17:46.199 --> 17:48.468
I'm surprised she didn't
toss it in your face.

17:49.904 --> 17:51.673
Oh, what?

17:51.706 --> 17:55.309
Well, kill her if you want to,
I don't give a shit.

17:55.342 --> 17:56.811
Go.

17:56.844 --> 17:58.513
Yeah.

19:17.692 --> 19:19.894
Bitches like you need
to be taught a fuckin' lesson!

19:19.927 --> 19:21.596
Shut up!

19:23.831 --> 19:26.233
Hey, that's a real
good-lookin' pup.

19:27.535 --> 19:29.704
Diego, attack!

19:32.807 --> 19:34.307
Diego!

19:41.516 --> 19:42.850
Good girl.

19:46.954 --> 19:48.455
Hi, Becky.

19:52.292 --> 19:53.561
You can sit down.

19:53.594 --> 19:55.630
I think she broke my nose.

19:55.663 --> 19:56.731
You little cunt.

19:56.764 --> 19:58.666
You broke my fuckin' nose!

20:00.568 --> 20:01.468
What happened?

20:01.502 --> 20:03.437
Apparently she broke
Anthony's nose.

20:03.470 --> 20:07.240
What the fuck happened to we're
just ding-dong ditching her?

20:07.274 --> 20:09.309
Yeah, we went with
Plan B instead.

20:09.342 --> 20:10.778
Oh, this is so bad.

20:10.812 --> 20:13.380
- This is so, so--
- Shut the fuck up.

20:13.413 --> 20:15.650
Now when I'm done with you,
you little shit,

20:15.683 --> 20:18.251
you're gonna wish your ass
was already dead.

20:18.920 --> 20:20.420
Hey!

20:22.523 --> 20:23.791
Put the gun down.

20:23.825 --> 20:25.292
Oh, fuck.

20:25.325 --> 20:26.627
Becky, don't move.

20:26.661 --> 20:27.895
Yeah, Becky, don't fuckin' move.

20:27.929 --> 20:28.996
Don't you speak to her.

20:29.030 --> 20:30.598
Hey, lady, listen to me.

20:30.631 --> 20:32.800
-Put the gun down.
-Put the gun down, dude.

20:32.834 --> 20:34.468
What do you want me to do, man?

20:34.502 --> 20:36.303
Put the gun down, man.
Put the fucking gun down!

20:36.336 --> 20:38.438
-Do it!
-I'm puttin' down the gun.

20:49.083 --> 20:52.285
Okay. It's down.

20:52.319 --> 20:55.355
Good.
Now get the fuck outta my house.

20:57.692 --> 20:58.860
Elena!

23:07.588 --> 23:09.389
Diego?

23:13.661 --> 23:14.896
Diego?

23:15.730 --> 23:17.865
Diego!

23:45.726 --> 23:46.761
DJ.

23:46.794 --> 23:47.962
Yeah.

23:49.897 --> 23:51.599
All right.

23:51.632 --> 23:54.068
I want the both of you
to listen up.

23:54.101 --> 23:56.737
No one speaks a word of this.

23:56.771 --> 23:58.806
-You hear me?
-Of course, bro.

23:58.839 --> 23:59.974
Hey.

24:01.208 --> 24:02.810
Do you hear me?

24:02.843 --> 24:04.178
She's gonna go
to the cops.

24:04.211 --> 24:06.013
Who the fuck cares?

24:06.047 --> 24:07.581
I care.

24:07.615 --> 24:08.783
You fuckin' killed her, man.

24:08.816 --> 24:10.151
You shot her
in the fuckin' face.

24:10.184 --> 24:12.119
If we get caught for this,
my life is over

24:12.153 --> 24:13.554
and I didn't even
fuckin' do anything.

24:13.587 --> 24:15.056
I didn't do any--

24:15.089 --> 24:18.526
You fuckin' listen to me,
you stupid, weak bitch.

24:18.559 --> 24:21.195
If I ever hear you say any of
that shit out loud ever again,

24:21.228 --> 24:22.697
I will shoot you
in the fuckin' face.

24:22.730 --> 24:24.532
You got that?

24:24.565 --> 24:27.668
She is a stupid-ass
little fuckin' twat.

24:27.702 --> 24:30.871
You keep
your fuckin' mouth shut.

24:30.905 --> 24:33.941
And we are outta here after
that fuckin' rally tomorrow.

24:33.975 --> 24:35.676
You understand?

24:38.179 --> 24:40.247
We're gonna be just fine.

24:40.281 --> 24:42.850
You better calm
the fuck down.

24:45.786 --> 24:48.222
He better keep the fuck cool.

24:50.925 --> 24:52.159
Not a word.

24:53.327 --> 24:54.862
How do you think he's gonna feel

24:54.895 --> 24:57.965
when he sees bullets
start flying tomorrow?

24:57.999 --> 25:00.968
'Cause I have a feeling
he ain't gonna be too chill.

25:01.002 --> 25:02.503
Hm?

25:03.571 --> 25:05.639
I mean, you invited him.

25:05.673 --> 25:07.908
That's all I'm saying.

26:22.249 --> 26:26.921
<i>Everyone I've ever loved</i>
<i>has been taken from me.</i>

26:26.954 --> 26:29.690
<i>Cancer took my mom.</i>

26:29.723 --> 26:32.693
<i>Neo-Nazis killed my dad.</i>

26:32.726 --> 26:36.030
<i>And now, Elena's gone.</i>

26:36.063 --> 26:39.066
I'm grateful for the home
that you gave me.

26:39.100 --> 26:43.137
<i>The way I saw it,</i>
<i>I had two orders of business.</i>

26:43.170 --> 26:46.273
I'm grateful for the time
that I spent with you.

26:46.307 --> 26:49.877
<i>I was gonna find my dog.</i>

26:49.910 --> 26:52.113
And I'm grateful
for another day.

26:52.146 --> 26:54.381
<i>And I was gonna kill</i>
<i>the motherfuckers</i>

26:54.415 --> 26:55.883
<i>who killed Elena.</i>

28:16.263 --> 28:17.364
<i>Back at the diner</i> ,

28:17.398 --> 28:19.433
<i>the guys had mentioned</i>
<i>someone named Darryl.</i>

28:19.466 --> 28:20.569
<i>Finding him wasn't difficult.</i>

28:20.602 --> 28:22.336
<i>Apparently,</i>
<i>there were only two Darryls</i>

28:22.369 --> 28:24.104
<i>in this shit town.</i>

28:24.138 --> 28:27.208
<i>I started at 2048 Denning Road.</i>

28:27.241 --> 28:29.276
<i>This was Darryl #1.</i>

28:40.354 --> 28:44.391
Well, hello there, darlin'.

28:46.293 --> 28:48.262
I'm looking for Darryl.

28:48.295 --> 28:49.797
That would be me.

28:49.830 --> 28:52.766
-Your name is Darryl?
-That's right.

29:00.007 --> 29:02.776
I don't think you're
supposed to be doing that.

29:03.811 --> 29:06.080
Well, I won't tell
if you don't.

29:08.115 --> 29:11.852
<i>Darryl #2 lived</i>
<i>at 4739 Colony Road.</i>

29:13.521 --> 29:16.123
<i>Something told me</i>
<i>that this was the Darryl</i>

29:16.156 --> 29:18.392
<i>I was looking for.</i>

29:37.278 --> 29:40.347
Dear heavenly Father.

29:40.381 --> 29:42.349
We come to You with thanks

29:42.383 --> 29:45.886
for this meal that
You put before us this evening.

29:46.854 --> 29:48.956
May it bless our bodies.

29:50.324 --> 29:54.295
Lord, we ask that You provide us
with ample rest tonight.

29:55.195 --> 29:56.598
Call us to serve You, Lord,

29:56.631 --> 29:59.534
and we don't take
that calling lightly.

30:01.168 --> 30:04.071
Lord, we ask You
to watch over us tomorrow

30:04.104 --> 30:05.472
along with the other Noble Men

30:05.507 --> 30:08.075
as we carry out that work
that You've called us

30:08.108 --> 30:10.411
to the front lines to do

30:11.378 --> 30:14.081
as we try to rid the world
of this filth

30:14.114 --> 30:16.150
that has been thrust
upon our great nation

30:16.183 --> 30:20.220
by the evils of Satan,
his followers,

30:20.254 --> 30:23.123
and those on the other side.

30:24.391 --> 30:27.461
In Your name, God Almighty,
we pray.

30:29.063 --> 30:30.598
Amen.

30:30.632 --> 30:32.366
-Amen.
-Amen.

30:32.399 --> 30:34.602
Dig in, boys.

30:34.636 --> 30:36.036
I can't remember
the last time I had

30:36.070 --> 30:37.938
a nice home-cooked meal
like this, guys.

30:37.971 --> 30:39.340
Seriously. Looks delicious.

30:39.373 --> 30:40.575
Thank you, sir.

30:40.608 --> 30:44.044
Well, you can, uh,
thank Twig here.

30:44.078 --> 30:45.479
He's the cook.

30:46.514 --> 30:48.182
Yup.

30:48.215 --> 30:49.483
Probably the one good thing

30:49.517 --> 30:51.586
my mama taught
me and my brother.

30:51.619 --> 30:53.120
Save for that,

30:53.153 --> 30:55.089
she's a useless femoid
like the rest of 'em.

30:55.122 --> 30:56.457
What the fuck is a femoid?

30:56.490 --> 30:58.025
You don't know
what a femoid is?

30:58.058 --> 30:59.426
Yeah, man, you don't know
what a femoid is?

30:59.460 --> 31:00.595
Oh, right,
like you do?

31:00.628 --> 31:01.929
It's like those things
from Austin Powers

31:01.962 --> 31:02.996
with the gun titties.

31:03.030 --> 31:04.465
No, that's a Fembot.

31:04.498 --> 31:06.433
-It's the same difference.
-No it ain't.

31:06.467 --> 31:08.168
All right, Jesus.

31:08.202 --> 31:09.436
Fuck me.

31:09.470 --> 31:12.406
Darryl, where'd you find
these peckerwoods anyway?

31:12.439 --> 31:15.476
I didn't. She did.

31:15.510 --> 31:16.910
Oh.

31:16.944 --> 31:17.779
And who's "she"?

31:17.812 --> 31:20.047
Seriously,
what the fuck is a femoid?

31:20.080 --> 31:21.649
A femoid is
a cross-pollenization

31:21.683 --> 31:23.317
of the word "female"
and "android,"

31:23.350 --> 31:24.586
and it's the perfect way
to describe

31:24.619 --> 31:26.588
nearly every woman
on God's green earth.

31:26.621 --> 31:29.022
Bunch of gynocentric
evil lowlife bitches

31:29.056 --> 31:31.225
hell-bent on destroying
any lesser man

31:31.258 --> 31:34.261
that doesn't fulfill
their twisted sexual fantasies

31:34.294 --> 31:36.930
or their financial fallacies.

31:45.607 --> 31:47.107
Damn, son!

31:47.141 --> 31:49.209
Let me be your Padawan, man!

31:49.243 --> 31:50.612
That shit is
what I'm talking about.

31:50.645 --> 31:52.312
Legit!

31:52.346 --> 31:54.214
You're not hungry there, Sean?

31:55.215 --> 31:57.050
What?

31:57.084 --> 31:58.352
Your food.

31:58.385 --> 32:00.187
You haven't touched it.

32:00.220 --> 32:01.589
Is something wrong?

32:01.623 --> 32:03.290
No, no, no,
my boy's fine.

32:03.323 --> 32:05.259
He's just tired
from the long drive up here.

32:05.292 --> 32:06.427
But he'll snap the fuck
out of it.

32:06.460 --> 32:07.261
Right, Sean?

32:07.294 --> 32:09.496
We don't wanna be rude
to our host.

32:11.432 --> 32:12.600
Yeah.

32:12.634 --> 32:14.569
Yeah. Sorry, sir.

32:14.602 --> 32:18.338
Why don't you take your hat off
at the dinner table, yeah?

32:21.008 --> 32:22.242
Sorry, sir.

32:23.343 --> 32:25.412
You boys can take it easy
on the "sir" stuff.

32:25.446 --> 32:28.482
I'm just a Noble Man,
same as you.

32:32.520 --> 32:34.221
It's all right, buddy.

32:43.531 --> 32:45.199
Why does he have
to stay in this thing?

32:45.232 --> 32:48.402
Oh yeah, he just hasn't been
feeling like himself lately.

32:48.435 --> 32:49.604
Got in a fight
with another dog

32:49.637 --> 32:51.205
who fucked him up pretty good.

32:51.238 --> 32:53.575
I just don't want him
to get all worked up.

32:53.608 --> 32:56.578
Yeah. Or eat us.

32:56.611 --> 32:59.379
It's good you're
taking care of him.

32:59.413 --> 33:01.081
Hey, maybe we can
get one of our flags

33:01.114 --> 33:02.349
with his face on it

33:02.382 --> 33:04.485
and it could say,
"Noble Dog."

33:04.519 --> 33:07.187
No, wait, even better:
"Noble Mutt."

33:09.724 --> 33:11.191
Hey, you hear that, boy?

33:11.225 --> 33:12.694
You're Noble Mutt.

33:14.161 --> 33:17.030
Yeah, that's one lucky dog
to have found us.

33:20.167 --> 33:21.335
Excuse me.

33:29.844 --> 33:32.747
Motion sickness
from the ride.

35:00.434 --> 35:02.302
You feelin' okay, kid?

35:05.472 --> 35:08.743
Yeah, good, I just
had to take a piss.

35:11.846 --> 35:13.380
Come with me.

35:14.247 --> 35:15.883
Yeah, okay.

35:20.722 --> 35:22.624
It's just up here
on your left.

35:29.329 --> 35:31.131
Go in there.

35:32.667 --> 35:34.368
You'll have to excuse the mess.

35:34.401 --> 35:35.335
As you can imagine,

35:35.369 --> 35:37.204
things have been
a little hectic around here.

35:37.772 --> 35:39.406
Go on, have a seat.

35:40.642 --> 35:46.213
So...when did you decide
to become a Noble Man?

35:46.246 --> 35:49.684
Um, few months back now?

35:49.717 --> 35:51.418
I mean, I've always
believed in the cause,

35:51.451 --> 35:53.186
I just didn't go
to my first rally

35:53.220 --> 35:54.656
until a few months ago.

35:54.689 --> 35:55.957
Wow.

35:55.990 --> 36:00.227
I would kill to experience
my first rally again.

36:00.260 --> 36:02.462
Anthony says
that's where you three met.

36:02.496 --> 36:05.900
Yeah. There was a march
back in our hometown.

36:05.933 --> 36:09.202
They, uh pepper-sprayed
the shit out of us.

36:09.236 --> 36:11.506
Well, it's good that
you were there to represent.

36:11.539 --> 36:13.541
It's important that
we show them our numbers.

36:13.574 --> 36:15.375
Have our voices heard,
you know?

36:15.409 --> 36:16.611
Yeah, for sure.

36:18.846 --> 36:21.281
You wanna see
something cool?

36:21.314 --> 36:24.384
Uh, yep, okay.

36:29.991 --> 36:32.259
Thumb drive.

36:32.292 --> 36:34.428
Not just any thumb drive.

36:34.461 --> 36:35.630
It's the only one of its kind

36:35.663 --> 36:39.199
entrusted by our founder
to yours truly.

36:40.735 --> 36:42.704
This is an air-gapped computer,

36:42.737 --> 36:43.838
our little way
to tell Uncle Sam

36:43.871 --> 36:46.406
to stay the fuck
out of our business.

36:49.010 --> 36:51.546
The 12 Disciples?

36:53.548 --> 36:54.782
Whoa.

36:54.816 --> 36:57.685
-Is that...
-It's impressive, isn't it?

36:59.352 --> 37:01.923
I didn't realize
how many of us there were.

37:01.956 --> 37:04.592
A lot more than twelve.

37:04.625 --> 37:05.860
Yeah.

37:10.798 --> 37:13.333
Did you know
that I served overseas?

37:14.869 --> 37:15.937
Uh, yeah.

37:15.970 --> 37:20.041
DJ'd mentioned something
about you being an ex-SEAL.

37:20.074 --> 37:22.543
Army Ranger,
staff sergeant.

37:22.577 --> 37:24.344
Did three
tours in Iraq.

37:24.377 --> 37:26.581
- Wow.
- Yeah.

37:26.614 --> 37:29.316
Me and my men, we, uh...

37:29.349 --> 37:30.518
we were in charge
of hunting down

37:30.551 --> 37:33.588
some of the real bad guys
over there.

37:33.621 --> 37:37.625
Well, um...
thank you for your service.

37:39.861 --> 37:43.296
You know, there was
this one night over there.

37:43.330 --> 37:45.800
My squad and I were
in this town

37:45.833 --> 37:49.570
and we were looking for this
real piece-of-shit towelhead.

37:49.604 --> 37:51.506
This fuckin' guy had
killed, like, fifteen of us

37:51.539 --> 37:53.641
at this point in the war.

37:53.674 --> 37:55.375
We get to his house.

37:55.408 --> 38:00.313
He's not there, but, uh,
his wife was.

38:00.347 --> 38:03.350
So, I put one of my men
out on lookout.

38:03.383 --> 38:04.986
This sweet kid...

38:05.019 --> 38:06.721
We called him Tootsie

38:06.754 --> 38:08.089
because he was always
having his family ship out

38:08.122 --> 38:10.725
those canisters
of Tootsie Rolls, right?

38:11.559 --> 38:15.596
Anyways, I'm, uh,
takin' my time with the wife

38:15.630 --> 38:17.064
and all of a sudden,
shots ring out.

38:17.098 --> 38:19.634
Within seconds,
all hell breaks loose.

38:19.667 --> 38:21.702
Bullets are just flying
in every direction.

38:21.736 --> 38:23.370
Tootsie bursts inside.

38:23.403 --> 38:25.039
He's bleeding
all over the place.

38:25.072 --> 38:27.642
Shot once in the shoulder,
twice in the legs.

38:27.675 --> 38:30.410
Shots weren't fatal
but he could hardly walk.

38:30.443 --> 38:31.946
Eventually, you know,
the three of us,

38:31.979 --> 38:34.615
we take cover
in this empty house.

38:34.649 --> 38:36.684
Now, we don't have a radio.

38:36.717 --> 38:38.085
I tell them, I said,

38:38.119 --> 38:41.522
"You know, our guys are
gonna come look for us."

38:41.556 --> 38:46.894
But Tootsie, he, uh...
couldn't keep quiet.

38:46.928 --> 38:48.830
He's just screaming in pain.

38:48.863 --> 38:52.667
Lopez and I--
that's the other guy--

38:52.700 --> 38:56.604
we just kept telling him,
"Shut the fuck up," you know?

38:56.637 --> 38:58.506
"They're gonna hear you
and they'll find us,"

38:58.539 --> 39:02.944
but he just
wouldn't stay calm, so...

39:05.012 --> 39:07.748
I took my hands

39:08.850 --> 39:11.619
and I put them over his face

39:12.452 --> 39:14.722
and I started to squeeze.

39:16.524 --> 39:18.391
I couldn't stop.

39:19.794 --> 39:23.898
Softer at first, and then,
I started to squeeze harder

39:23.931 --> 39:27.467
and harder, until...

39:36.978 --> 39:40.781
Of course, you know,
Lopez never told a soul.

39:40.815 --> 39:45.452
He knew that what I did was
the best thing for the squad.

39:45.485 --> 39:47.088
You see, that's the thing
about being part of something

39:47.121 --> 39:48.723
bigger than yourself.

39:48.756 --> 39:50.691
It's a team effort,

39:50.725 --> 39:53.694
and each individual on that team
has to do their part

39:53.728 --> 39:56.063
or they take the others down
with 'em.

39:57.231 --> 40:01.468
One weak link
and the entire team fails.

40:06.540 --> 40:08.843
You're not a weak link,
are you?

40:11.045 --> 40:12.613
No, sir.

40:13.547 --> 40:15.482
You sure about that?

40:15.950 --> 40:17.752
Y-yes, sir.

40:19.053 --> 40:22.123
And what did I say
about you boys calling me "sir"?

40:23.057 --> 40:24.457
Sorry.

40:30.131 --> 40:33.167
I am proud to be in
the brotherhood with you, buddy.

40:36.003 --> 40:38.005
Yeah, for sure.

40:41.108 --> 40:42.610
I'm just gonna...

40:45.012 --> 40:46.514
Hey, Sean,
one more thing.

40:46.547 --> 40:47.915
Yeah?

40:47.949 --> 40:49.817
What happened to you guys
last night?

40:49.850 --> 40:51.986
I was expecting you
around midnight.

40:52.019 --> 40:53.988
Everything go okay
on the drive?

40:54.021 --> 40:56.691
Yeah, we, uh,
just had a flat tire,

40:56.724 --> 40:59.160
decided to kill some time
at a diner.

41:00.995 --> 41:03.798
Yeah, I figured it was
something like that.

41:04.832 --> 41:06.567
Go on, go on.

41:06.600 --> 41:07.969
Enjoy yourself.

41:45.339 --> 41:46.907
Darryl!

41:46.941 --> 41:48.776
What the hell you doin'
in there?

41:48.809 --> 41:51.112
Yeah, I'm comin'.

42:17.038 --> 42:18.672
<i>It was right</i>
<i>then and there,</i>

42:18.706 --> 42:20.307
<i>scrolling through</i>
<i>that never-ending list</i>

42:20.341 --> 42:22.343
<i>of pencil-dick motherfuckers,</i>

42:22.376 --> 42:24.912
<i>that I realized</i>
<i>Elena was right.</i>

42:24.945 --> 42:27.048
<i>The world had gone mad.</i>

42:27.081 --> 42:29.350
<i>And maybe</i>
<i>I couldn't save the world</i>

42:29.383 --> 42:32.119
<i>but I could kill</i>
<i>some of those shit stains</i>

42:32.153 --> 42:35.322
<i>and I could have a whole</i>
<i>hell of a lot of fun doin' it.</i>

43:44.425 --> 43:45.993
To saving our country

43:46.026 --> 43:47.161
and to stopping the treason

43:47.194 --> 43:49.964
one vengeful mission
at a time.

43:49.997 --> 43:51.799
To freedom.

43:51.832 --> 43:53.367
-Freedom.
-Freedom.

43:56.437 --> 43:58.439
Thought she wasn't comin'
till tonight.

43:58.472 --> 44:00.708
Who the hell is "she"?

44:54.094 --> 44:55.829
Who is it?

44:55.863 --> 44:58.432
Well, apparently,

44:58.465 --> 44:59.934
it's Becky.

45:03.837 --> 45:06.340
Went to answer the door
but there was nobody there.

45:06.373 --> 45:08.008
Just this.

45:08.842 --> 45:09.977
Shit.

45:10.010 --> 45:11.145
How the fuck
did she find us?

45:12.246 --> 45:13.480
I'm sorry.

45:13.515 --> 45:15.316
You three know
something about this?

45:15.349 --> 45:17.785
No. Nothing.

45:17.818 --> 45:19.019
One of you care to tell me

45:19.053 --> 45:20.321
what the fuck it is
you're not tellin' me?

45:20.354 --> 45:22.323
-Just tell him, you guys.
-You shut the fuck up.

45:22.356 --> 45:23.791
I think it would be wise

45:23.824 --> 45:25.259
if you listened
to your friend here.

45:25.292 --> 45:26.994
Yeah, what the fuck's
goin' on, gents?

45:27.027 --> 45:28.429
-All right...
-DJ.

45:28.462 --> 45:30.130
All right, fine--no, no,
it's cool, it's cool man.

45:30.164 --> 45:32.066
They're cool, we're gonna just
tell him about the dog, yeah?

45:32.099 --> 45:34.134
- What about the dog?
- We took him, that's it.

45:34.168 --> 45:36.070
- You took him.
- Yep. Not a big deal.

45:36.103 --> 45:37.371
-Yeah, but that's not it.
-All right.

45:37.404 --> 45:39.039
-Shut the fuck up.
-Shut the fuck up!

45:39.073 --> 45:40.508
All right, all right, fine.

45:40.542 --> 45:42.544
We took him from some
stupid-ass little girl.

45:42.577 --> 45:45.779
That's what Dickless here
wants you to know, okay?

45:48.215 --> 45:49.483
What?

45:49.517 --> 45:50.484
She was fucking with us
at the diner

45:50.518 --> 45:53.153
so we followed her
and stole her fuckin' dog.

45:53.187 --> 45:55.055
Big deal.

45:55.089 --> 45:56.156
Is that what you wanted?

45:56.190 --> 45:57.391
You happy now?

46:00.261 --> 46:01.428
Is there any chance that,
that little girl's

46:01.462 --> 46:02.997
name is Becky?

46:08.603 --> 46:10.971
<i>There</i>
<i>once was a little girl</i>

46:11.005 --> 46:12.973
<i>who had a little curl</i>

46:13.007 --> 46:16.544
<i>right in the middle</i>
<i>of her forehead.</i>

46:16.578 --> 46:21.415
<i>When she was good,</i>
<i>she was very, very good,</i>

46:21.448 --> 46:25.886
<i>and when she was bad,</i>
<i>she was horrid.</i>

46:33.127 --> 46:34.461
I don't know about you guys,

46:34.495 --> 46:37.264
but that was fucking hilarious,
right?

46:37.298 --> 46:39.400
Yo, that girl's got some balls,
right?

46:39.433 --> 46:41.068
She's messing with us.

46:41.101 --> 46:42.504
Tryin' to make us feel inferior.

46:42.537 --> 46:44.004
Oh my God,
you know what, dude?

46:44.038 --> 46:45.472
You need to calm the fuck down.

46:45.507 --> 46:46.974
I think we'll survive
a scary nursery rhyme.

46:47.007 --> 46:48.342
Yeah, this is exactly
what she wants,

46:48.375 --> 46:49.276
to make us turn against
each other.

46:49.310 --> 46:50.612
What the hell's the matter
with you guys?

46:50.645 --> 46:51.780
Come on, she's like,
what, twelve?

46:51.812 --> 46:54.415
Yeah, the girl definitely
still shops at Hot Topic.

46:54.448 --> 46:56.016
No, she's a classic Becky.

46:56.050 --> 46:57.451
-A classic what?
-A Becky.

46:57.484 --> 46:59.186
Yeah, we've established
that's her name.

46:59.219 --> 47:00.555
No--a Becky.

47:00.588 --> 47:01.589
Let me guess.

47:01.623 --> 47:03.290
A dyed-hair, loose-clothes,

47:03.324 --> 47:05.459
at best a 5
on the hotness scale.

47:05.492 --> 47:07.394
Oh, for fuck's-- yeah,
we get it, man, you 4chan.

47:07.428 --> 47:08.862
-Shut the hell up.
-No, no, no,

47:08.896 --> 47:09.731
you shut the hell up.

47:09.764 --> 47:11.131
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you!

47:11.165 --> 47:12.499
- Fuck you!
- Would one of you please

47:12.534 --> 47:14.168
just go find the girl

47:14.201 --> 47:17.137
and give her back
her fuckin' dog?!

47:23.545 --> 47:25.179
Yeah, no, no--no problem.

47:25.212 --> 47:27.014
I'll do it.

47:27.047 --> 47:29.049
Yeah, I-I'll go.

47:33.087 --> 47:35.189
Aren't you forgetting something?

47:35.222 --> 47:36.924
What am I forgetting?

47:37.692 --> 47:39.661
The dog.

47:39.694 --> 47:41.529
All right, look, man.

47:41.563 --> 47:42.996
When we took the dog from her,

47:43.030 --> 47:44.431
she saw our faces, okay?

47:44.465 --> 47:46.166
Now, if I just go
give him back to her,

47:46.200 --> 47:48.402
she's gonna haul ass
straight for the cops.

47:48.435 --> 47:50.037
That's not really my problem.

47:50.070 --> 47:51.438
No, it sure as shit
is your problem

47:51.472 --> 47:53.941
if you want us
at that town hall tomorrow.

47:55.175 --> 47:56.910
Look.

47:56.944 --> 48:00.047
She's just a stupid kid
playing a game of hide-and-seek.

48:00.080 --> 48:02.015
All I'm gonna do is
just go and find her,

48:02.049 --> 48:04.017
get her to calm the fuck down,

48:04.051 --> 48:08.088
then I'll give her
her fuckin' dog back.

48:08.122 --> 48:09.323
Okay?

48:25.507 --> 48:27.174
Hey, Becky!

48:29.176 --> 48:31.478
You want your dog back?

48:32.146 --> 48:33.313
Huh?

48:34.616 --> 48:36.618
You come and talk to me.

48:37.418 --> 48:39.621
You come and talk to me!

48:45.693 --> 48:47.327
Hey.

48:47.361 --> 48:49.496
Would you stop?

48:49.531 --> 48:52.499
Look, I'm gonna give you
your stupid dog back.

48:52.534 --> 48:54.234
All right, goddammit, stop,
or I'm gonna shoot you

48:54.268 --> 48:56.336
right in the fucking head.

48:59.106 --> 49:00.974
Thank you.

49:01.008 --> 49:03.043
You know, you put me
in a pretty tricky situation.

49:03.076 --> 49:05.012
Oh yeah, what's that?

49:05.045 --> 49:08.048
Well, I'd shoot you, but, well,
then they'd hear the gunshots

49:08.081 --> 49:10.585
and start asking
a lot of dumbass questions.

49:10.618 --> 49:13.688
Hm. That would be
real annoying.

49:14.556 --> 49:17.024
You're right, it would be.

49:17.725 --> 49:20.628
So it looks like
I'm just gonna have to find

49:20.662 --> 49:23.230
a better way to kill you.

49:30.270 --> 49:31.739
The fuck?!

49:31.773 --> 49:33.608
Your friend probably shouldn't
leave keys in his tractor.

49:33.641 --> 49:35.309
What the fuck?

49:35.342 --> 49:37.110
You better get me
the fuck out of here.

49:37.144 --> 49:38.713
-You killed my friend.
-Yeah,

49:38.746 --> 49:40.180
and I'm gonna kill you too

49:40.214 --> 49:41.516
if you don't get me
the fuck out of here!

49:41.549 --> 49:43.551
Then, you took my dog.

49:43.585 --> 49:45.219
Your dog is fine!

49:45.252 --> 49:47.722
That's what I've been trying
to tell you!

49:51.826 --> 49:53.360
Okay.

49:53.393 --> 49:55.763
I'd shoot you
but they'd hear the gunshot.

49:55.797 --> 49:58.533
And to be honest, you know,
guns kinda bore me.

50:00.367 --> 50:04.071
I guess I'll just have to find
a better way to kill you.

50:50.585 --> 50:54.589
Yeah!

50:54.622 --> 50:56.123
That's a Noble song.

50:56.156 --> 50:57.457
Whoo!

50:57.491 --> 50:59.293
That would blow up on Parler.

51:01.663 --> 51:03.665
Christ, man, now what?

51:16.143 --> 51:18.111
Don't open the door!

51:18.145 --> 51:19.614
What the fuck?

51:19.647 --> 51:22.182
Please don't open
the door, please!

51:22.215 --> 51:23.417
Please!

51:23.450 --> 51:26.453
No! No!

51:26.486 --> 51:29.423
Darryl,
don't open the fucking door!

51:46.306 --> 51:47.441
Darryl!

51:47.474 --> 51:49.376
What the hell was that?

51:51.546 --> 51:53.146
Did his head just explode?

51:53.180 --> 51:55.282
Mother of God.

52:05.793 --> 52:06.894
Darryl, what are we doin', man?

52:06.928 --> 52:08.295
Should we go to the cops?

52:08.328 --> 52:09.463
Oh, I don't know, Twig.

52:09.496 --> 52:11.164
I got a headless corpse
on my doorstep

52:11.198 --> 52:12.533
and enough weaponry in my barn

52:12.567 --> 52:14.702
to start an insurrection
at town hall tomorrow,

52:14.736 --> 52:16.303
so perhaps bringing the cops
onto the property

52:16.336 --> 52:17.772
isn't the best course of action.

52:17.805 --> 52:20.575
What do you think,
you fucking idiot?

52:20.608 --> 52:22.510
Yeah, probably right.

52:24.378 --> 52:26.246
You two.

52:26.279 --> 52:27.548
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!
-Fuck!

52:27.582 --> 52:28.516
Talk.

52:28.549 --> 52:30.618
-Okay, we killed the lady.
-No, no, hey, no.

52:30.652 --> 52:33.487
We did not kill anyone.
Anthony did.

52:33.521 --> 52:35.188
-Who was she?
-She was just some old lady.

52:35.222 --> 52:36.223
Who was she?

52:36.256 --> 52:37.091
I don't know.
We don't know.

52:37.125 --> 52:38.258
No, no, no,
he's telling the truth.

52:38.291 --> 52:39.527
Look, Anthony wanted
to follow the girl home

52:39.560 --> 52:41.896
from the diner and he said that
he was just gonna scare her.

52:41.929 --> 52:43.463
But then some old lady
came out with a gun

52:43.497 --> 52:44.666
and so, he fuckin' shot her.

52:44.699 --> 52:46.366
And then we took her dog.

52:47.167 --> 52:48.603
Dude, dude, dude,
that's it, dude,

52:48.636 --> 52:49.570
I swear to God, man.

52:49.604 --> 52:51.572
I'm supposed to believe
that a little girl

52:51.606 --> 52:52.840
is doing all of this
on her own.

52:52.874 --> 52:54.274
Yeah, I don't fuckin' know, man,

52:54.307 --> 52:55.743
but we're telling you
everything.

52:55.777 --> 52:58.846
You should've given her
her fuckin' dog back.

53:00.948 --> 53:02.750
Wait a minute, did...

53:03.885 --> 53:06.554
did you just say
"insurrection"?

53:06.587 --> 53:07.822
What?

53:08.990 --> 53:13.695
You just said that we have
enough weaponry in that barn

53:13.728 --> 53:15.897
for an insurrection.

53:18.298 --> 53:19.801
I knew that
there was something

53:19.834 --> 53:22.870
you two assholes
weren't telling me.

53:22.904 --> 53:24.572
Are you fucking
kidding me, bro?

53:24.605 --> 53:26.007
You said that
this was just a rally.

53:26.040 --> 53:27.608
No one cares about that.

53:27.642 --> 53:30.243
You guys have been lying to me
this entire fucking time.

53:30.277 --> 53:32.680
What the fuck
is your problem, man?

53:36.283 --> 53:37.585
Fuck this...

53:38.653 --> 53:40.353
Fuck this.

53:40.387 --> 53:41.488
I'm out.

53:41.522 --> 53:43.991
No, hey--hey, Sean, listen.

53:44.025 --> 53:48.295
That little psychopath just
blew Anthony's head sky high.

53:48.328 --> 53:49.864
She'll kill you.

53:50.832 --> 53:52.600
I'm gonna take my chances.

53:52.633 --> 53:53.868
Sean.

53:53.901 --> 53:55.770
Sean!

53:55.803 --> 53:58.740
Hey. Wait, wait.

54:01.374 --> 54:02.910
Stay. Stay the night.

54:04.478 --> 54:06.581
We'll get through this,
together.

54:06.614 --> 54:09.282
And you can help us
with our calling tomorrow,

54:09.316 --> 54:11.284
for the brotherhood.

54:13.087 --> 54:15.489
Fuck the brotherhood.

54:15.523 --> 54:17.925
And fuck you,
you psycho motherf--

54:22.096 --> 54:23.798
Jesus fuck!

54:26.701 --> 54:30.571
I asked Anthony
to bring me Noble Men.

54:35.076 --> 54:39.346
Now, this is not a Noble Man.

54:51.025 --> 54:52.760
What about you?

54:55.696 --> 54:57.098
Are you a Noble Man?

54:58.298 --> 55:00.601
Do you honestly think
I would say no to that question

55:00.635 --> 55:02.469
right now?

55:02.502 --> 55:04.404
Answer the question.

55:04.437 --> 55:05.573
Yes.

55:07.008 --> 55:09.376
I'm a fucking Noble Man.

55:10.878 --> 55:12.479
Good.

55:13.714 --> 55:14.682
Move the body.

55:30.164 --> 55:31.265
<i>You may want</i>
<i>to invest in one of those</i>

55:31.299 --> 55:33.734
<i>power washers for the</i>
<i>front of your house.</i>

55:34.068 --> 55:35.536
Are you having fun?

55:35.570 --> 55:38.139
Wicked fun. You?

55:38.172 --> 55:40.107
<i>I think that</i>
<i>I'm beginning to like you.</i>

55:40.141 --> 55:42.543
Too bad the feeling
isn't mutual.

55:44.444 --> 55:47.615
I'm told that my houseguests
upset you last night.

55:47.648 --> 55:49.817
<i>Yeah, you could say that.</i>

55:49.851 --> 55:51.451
What is she saying?

55:51.484 --> 55:52.854
Yeah, what's she saying?

55:52.887 --> 55:54.421
I wanted to keep things cordial,

55:54.454 --> 55:57.124
give you your dog back, but...

55:57.158 --> 55:59.560
<i>you seem to have other plans.</i>

56:01.428 --> 56:04.031
I would, uh, love
to play with you,

56:04.065 --> 56:07.902
<i>really would,</i>
<i>but unfortunately,</i>

56:07.935 --> 56:10.437
I have more pressing business
to attend to.

56:10.470 --> 56:11.906
<i>It's not a bad plan,</i>

56:11.939 --> 56:14.542
you know, the one you have to
attack town hall tomorrow.

56:16.210 --> 56:18.946
What the hell's goin' on,
Darryl?

56:19.914 --> 56:22.149
You're fuckin' with
the wrong guy, little girl.

56:22.183 --> 56:26.120
I have photo evidence
from your little command center.

56:26.153 --> 56:27.521
We should really talk

56:27.555 --> 56:30.791
<i>about that creepy Senator</i>
<i>Hernandez mannequin, BT-dubs.</i>

56:30.825 --> 56:32.459
<i>Did you buy that wig,</i>

56:32.492 --> 56:36.097
<i>or is it something you enjoy</i>
<i>in your downtime?</i>

56:36.130 --> 56:40.467
Maybe I should just put a bullet
in your dog's skull right now.

56:40.500 --> 56:41.602
Do it and I'll send
all the photos

56:41.636 --> 56:44.672
to the sheriff's office
the second I hear a gunshot.

56:44.705 --> 56:48.441
<i>Every single one</i>
<i>of you fake patriotic fuckers</i>

56:48.475 --> 56:49.911
<i>will go down.</i>

56:49.944 --> 56:52.813
Yo, could you just tell me
if she's coming for me

56:52.847 --> 56:55.016
since technically I'm the one
who fucked up her dog?

56:55.049 --> 56:57.952
Fuck it, I'm gonna end this.

56:57.985 --> 57:01.188
Gotta admit, you got me
between a rock and a hard place.

57:01.222 --> 57:03.658
Oh, good, then I'm doing
something right.

57:03.691 --> 57:05.893
<i>You know what, fuck your dog.</i>

57:05.927 --> 57:08.229
I'm just gonna have to kill you.

57:08.262 --> 57:10.865
You could,
but then you'd never find

57:10.898 --> 57:12.600
where I hid your thumb drive,

57:12.633 --> 57:14.735
<i>and I bet a lot of people</i>
<i>would love to see</i>

57:14.769 --> 57:16.469
<i>that list of douchebags.</i>

57:24.111 --> 57:25.846
You're fuckin' dead.

57:25.880 --> 57:28.049
Cool, just one more thing
real quick,

57:28.082 --> 57:30.483
your friend on the dock
could use a hand.

57:39.226 --> 57:41.228
She's got a crossbow!

57:41.262 --> 57:42.763
She's got a fucking crossbow!

57:42.797 --> 57:44.198
Get it out, Darryl, get it out!

57:44.231 --> 57:46.200
Calm down!
All right, hold still.

57:46.233 --> 57:47.601
Wait, what are
you gonna do?

57:47.635 --> 57:48.970
What are you gonna do?!

57:49.537 --> 57:51.072
Ah, fuck!

57:59.246 --> 58:01.515
Wait, what are
you doing?

58:01.549 --> 58:03.217
Twig, she has the USB!

58:07.121 --> 58:09.023
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you!

58:31.846 --> 58:33.647
Eat shit, you little bitch.

58:41.889 --> 58:43.791
-She dead yet?
-She has the list.

58:43.824 --> 58:45.860
-What list?
-The fucking list!

58:45.893 --> 58:47.695
You can say that as many times
as you want, man,

58:47.728 --> 58:50.164
I'll still have no fucking idea
what you're talking about!

58:50.197 --> 58:51.866
No, no, no, hey,
no, stop, please.

58:51.899 --> 58:53.667
You're gonna stop him
from killing that girl,

58:53.701 --> 58:55.669
and then you're gonna bring
her back to me alive,

58:55.703 --> 58:57.304
and if you don't,
you will fucking wish

58:57.338 --> 58:59.140
she was the one
who was slaughtering you!

58:59.173 --> 59:00.574
-You get me?
-I get you.

59:00.608 --> 59:02.743
-You fucking get me?!
-I fucking get you!

59:02.777 --> 59:03.944
Go!

59:05.846 --> 59:07.648
Fuck this shit!

59:16.057 --> 59:17.892
Motherfucker.

59:24.265 --> 59:25.633
Hey!

59:29.236 --> 59:30.571
Stop!

59:43.317 --> 59:45.719
Looks like
someone's trapped, huh?

59:48.122 --> 59:51.792
You're not gettin' out of this
barn alive, I'll tell you that.

59:55.796 --> 59:57.131
Oh, fuck me.

01:00:35.369 --> 01:00:37.138
No!

01:00:38.472 --> 01:00:39.740
No!

01:00:42.743 --> 01:00:44.111
No!

01:00:47.448 --> 01:00:50.017
<i>I wish, but I couldn't</i>
<i>find the keys to that one.</i>

01:00:50.050 --> 01:00:52.186
<i>Still, I managed.</i>

01:01:14.175 --> 01:01:16.143
,
I have a kid!

01:01:16.177 --> 01:01:18.112
I have a kid!

01:01:19.079 --> 01:01:20.381
A baby boy,

01:01:21.182 --> 01:01:22.750
and a wife.

01:01:23.884 --> 01:01:25.386
I'm so sorry.

01:01:25.419 --> 01:01:27.288
I'm sorry.

01:01:27.321 --> 01:01:30.724
I act like I'm a tough guy,
but I'm not.

01:01:30.758 --> 01:01:33.360
I act like I hate women,
but I don't.

01:01:33.394 --> 01:01:35.095
I really don't.

01:01:37.097 --> 01:01:39.867
I swear, if you let me live,
I will never say

01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:43.470
another horrible thing
about women ever, ever again.

01:01:43.505 --> 01:01:45.806
I'll love my wife
with all of me,

01:01:45.839 --> 01:01:50.444
and I will raise my son
to be the best man he can be.

01:01:53.981 --> 01:01:57.384
Please, I don't want to die.

01:01:57.418 --> 01:01:58.886
I'll do anything.

01:02:01.155 --> 01:02:02.756
What's his name?

01:02:03.424 --> 01:02:04.925
Huh?

01:02:04.959 --> 01:02:07.161
Your son, what's his name?

01:02:08.530 --> 01:02:09.830
Fuck.

01:02:11.298 --> 01:02:12.866
It's Adolf.

01:02:14.235 --> 01:02:16.770
You gotta be fucking kidding me!

01:02:16.804 --> 01:02:18.405
No!

01:03:17.931 --> 01:03:19.266
Good morning.

01:03:21.869 --> 01:03:23.904
You slept through the night.

01:03:30.177 --> 01:03:33.247
Has anyone ever told you
that you cry out in your sleep?

01:03:35.282 --> 01:03:37.051
Diego!

01:03:41.422 --> 01:03:45.025
Try all you want, you're not
getting out of those knots.

01:03:45.059 --> 01:03:46.293
Boy Scout.

01:03:49.897 --> 01:03:52.600
You seem to have left this
in the woods.

01:03:57.004 --> 01:03:58.872
You came prepared.

01:04:07.014 --> 01:04:08.583
True Grit.

01:04:10.217 --> 01:04:11.586
You've got grit.

01:04:12.587 --> 01:04:14.088
I'll give you that.

01:04:15.590 --> 01:04:17.257
I also found this.

01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:22.262
I figured it was nothing,
but then...

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:28.469
Looks like coordinates.

01:04:31.372 --> 01:04:33.407
I think I'll keep it.

01:04:35.075 --> 01:04:36.310
Darryl,

01:04:36.343 --> 01:04:38.613
you out there talking
to yourself or what?

01:04:38.646 --> 01:04:42.883
I'd introduce you two,
but I'm told you already met.

01:05:01.536 --> 01:05:02.670
Well...

01:05:04.639 --> 01:05:06.641
hello there, darling.

01:05:08.976 --> 01:05:11.044
Remember me?

01:05:16.183 --> 01:05:18.452
You look
confused.

01:05:18.485 --> 01:05:20.354
Is it the name?

01:05:20.387 --> 01:05:26.226
Now who says only men can name
their kids after themselves?

01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:30.964
I may be the mastermind
of the Noble Men,

01:05:30.998 --> 01:05:34.669
but I could still be woke, no?

01:05:39.306 --> 01:05:44.378
I hear you've been causing
quite the ruckus around here.

01:05:51.719 --> 01:05:56.023
So, tell me, darling,

01:05:56.724 --> 01:05:59.092
where is the thumb drive?

01:06:03.297 --> 01:06:07.134
I don't think you understand
the gravity

01:06:07.167 --> 01:06:09.503
of what it is
you're doing right now,

01:06:09.537 --> 01:06:14.441
but I would urge you
to reconsider.

01:06:14.475 --> 01:06:18.479
You don't seriously think
I'll tell you, do you?

01:06:18.513 --> 01:06:19.681
Your son said it himself.

01:06:19.714 --> 01:06:22.684
That little piece of plastic
is the only one of its kind,

01:06:22.717 --> 01:06:24.786
which means the only reason
I'm still alive

01:06:24.819 --> 01:06:27.454
is because I know where it is.

01:06:30.424 --> 01:06:32.159
Well...

01:06:34.261 --> 01:06:36.698
how about this?

01:06:36.731 --> 01:06:40.167
If you tell us,
there is a small chance

01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:42.637
I will let you go,

01:06:42.670 --> 01:06:46.106
but if you don't tell us,
there's a far greater chance

01:06:46.139 --> 01:06:50.110
that I will lose my patience
and say, "To hell with it,"

01:06:50.143 --> 01:06:55.048
and let Darryl here
have his way with you.

01:06:56.651 --> 01:07:01.054
So, I'm gonna ask you
once again, sugar.

01:07:01.689 --> 01:07:04.358
Where is the thumb drive?

01:07:07.529 --> 01:07:08.663
Told you.

01:07:08.696 --> 01:07:12.534
Well, you weren't kiddin'.

01:07:12.567 --> 01:07:18.573
I think we might be goin'
about this all wrong.

01:07:18.606 --> 01:07:20.708
Maybe you should join us, honey.

01:07:20.742 --> 01:07:26.146
Hell, we could use some more
of that feisty female energy.

01:07:26.179 --> 01:07:28.315
I'll pass.

01:07:28.348 --> 01:07:30.685
Aw, shucks.

01:07:30.718 --> 01:07:33.120
That's a shame.

01:07:35.823 --> 01:07:37.759
Get him.

01:07:42.129 --> 01:07:45.399
You got quite the sweetie pie
here, you know that?

01:07:48.335 --> 01:07:52.172
Yeah, we got to spend
some quality time together

01:07:52.205 --> 01:07:55.108
while you were, uh, sleepin'.

01:07:55.142 --> 01:07:58.211
I guess the boys were
a little bit busy, you know,

01:07:58.245 --> 01:08:00.213
dealing with you and what all,

01:08:00.247 --> 01:08:02.449
so by the time
I got here this morning,

01:08:02.482 --> 01:08:05.753
they had forgotten
to let the poor thing out.

01:08:05.787 --> 01:08:10.157
So I took him out
to do his business.

01:08:10.190 --> 01:08:12.594
Didn't I? Yeah.

01:08:12.627 --> 01:08:14.328
Heel.

01:08:14.361 --> 01:08:16.531
That's my boy!

01:08:16.564 --> 01:08:19.399
Yes, that's my boy.

01:08:19.433 --> 01:08:21.669
Incredible, isn't it?

01:08:21.703 --> 01:08:25.573
Dogs, fascinating creatures,
aren't they?

01:08:25.607 --> 01:08:28.442
They love their owners,

01:08:28.475 --> 01:08:31.512
but the one thing
that they love more

01:08:31.546 --> 01:08:35.248
than their moms and pops
is food, of course,

01:08:35.282 --> 01:08:37.885
especially meat.

01:08:37.919 --> 01:08:43.691
Yeah, and does this boy
love meat.

01:08:43.725 --> 01:08:48.896
Yes, you're my love,
yes, you are.

01:08:48.930 --> 01:08:53.935
You know, I am a dog lover
just like you, always have been.

01:08:53.968 --> 01:08:58.940
In fact, I like animals
more than I like humans,

01:08:58.973 --> 01:09:03.611
and although it's been said that
I have kind of a mean streak,

01:09:03.645 --> 01:09:05.780
when it comes
to these little creatures,

01:09:05.813 --> 01:09:09.817
I don't have a mean bone
in my body.

01:09:09.851 --> 01:09:12.954
Now, Junior, on the other hand,

01:09:12.987 --> 01:09:17.692
he doesn't mind getting
his hands dirty, do you, baby?

01:09:19.527 --> 01:09:21.228
Stop it!

01:09:21.261 --> 01:09:23.898
Oh, he doesn't like that.

01:09:23.931 --> 01:09:25.933
Here you go.

01:09:25.967 --> 01:09:29.537
There, all better,
all better, right?

01:09:29.570 --> 01:09:32.272
You just made
a big fucking mistake!

01:09:32.305 --> 01:09:34.776
Darling, you are gonna tell me
where that thumb drive is,

01:09:34.809 --> 01:09:37.578
or those mistakes
are gonna keep on happening,

01:09:37.612 --> 01:09:43.216
and they are gonna get bigger
and badder until, eventually,

01:09:43.250 --> 01:09:47.387
there won't be any air left
for him to yelp.

01:09:56.597 --> 01:09:57.865
Okay.

01:09:59.967 --> 01:10:01.703
Okay what?

01:10:03.004 --> 01:10:06.541
I'll tell you where it is,
but...

01:10:08.442 --> 01:10:10.812
you have to make me a promise.

01:10:13.346 --> 01:10:14.849
Put him away.

01:10:30.464 --> 01:10:34.267
So, name your terms.

01:10:36.771 --> 01:10:39.874
When I get out of this chair,

01:10:40.808 --> 01:10:42.877
and I kill you both,

01:10:44.311 --> 01:10:46.748
promise me you'll go
straight to hell.

01:10:47.682 --> 01:10:50.383
And how do you plan
on getting out of that chair?

01:10:51.418 --> 01:10:52.452
Girl Scout.

01:10:52.486 --> 01:10:53.554
God damn it.

01:11:11.371 --> 01:11:12.472
Fuck.

01:11:14.075 --> 01:11:15.543
Fuck!

01:11:17.945 --> 01:11:19.514
Stop!

01:11:22.617 --> 01:11:25.086
I was gonna let my son kill you,

01:11:25.119 --> 01:11:29.657
but I think I'll do
the honors myself.

01:11:29.690 --> 01:11:32.894
If you kill me,
you'll never find the drive.

01:11:32.927 --> 01:11:34.529
Oh, you're right.

01:11:36.396 --> 01:11:38.365
Sorry, pooch.

01:11:40.067 --> 01:11:40.835
No!

01:11:51.546 --> 01:11:53.047
I'll be back, okay?

01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:55.883
You can't get hurt,
but I will be back.

01:11:55.917 --> 01:11:57.417
Okay, I'll be back, I promise.

01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:15.495
It was fun while it lasted.

01:13:16.197 --> 01:13:18.431
It's not over yet.

01:14:06.047 --> 01:14:07.648
Well done.

01:14:58.833 --> 01:15:00.301
Diego!

01:15:00.334 --> 01:15:02.737
Diego, hi.

01:15:02.770 --> 01:15:04.238
Hi, hi, come here.

01:15:04.271 --> 01:15:05.940
Come here, come here.

01:15:05.973 --> 01:15:07.208
Hi, yes.

01:15:07.241 --> 01:15:09.110
Hi, hi, come here.

01:15:09.143 --> 01:15:12.213
I know, I know, I know.

01:15:20.121 --> 01:15:22.123
Hi, buddy, hi.

01:15:27.795 --> 01:15:33.167
Well, aren't you
two just the cutest?

01:15:41.108 --> 01:15:44.945
Guess you missed my brain.

01:15:48.849 --> 01:15:50.951
Guess I didn't.

01:15:50.985 --> 01:15:53.154
Oh, shit.

01:15:53.187 --> 01:15:54.955
Diego,

01:15:56.624 --> 01:15:57.691
attack.

01:15:58.893 --> 01:16:00.327
No!

01:16:02.096 --> 01:16:03.798
No! No!

01:16:05.833 --> 01:16:07.201
You were right.

01:16:08.102 --> 01:16:10.838
He really does love meat.

01:16:54.682 --> 01:16:56.183
Hello, Rebecca.

01:16:56.217 --> 01:16:59.053
I'm Kate Montana of the CIA.

01:16:59.086 --> 01:17:01.255
Do you know what this is?

01:17:03.991 --> 01:17:05.359
I might.

01:17:05.392 --> 01:17:07.061
That's a thumb drive,

01:17:07.094 --> 01:17:08.929
and it contains the names
of the members

01:17:08.963 --> 01:17:11.765
of one of the most dangerous
terrorist organizations

01:17:11.799 --> 01:17:13.067
in the United States.

01:17:13.100 --> 01:17:15.269
We've been following them
for years.

01:17:15.302 --> 01:17:17.671
They've expanded
through all fifty states,

01:17:17.705 --> 01:17:20.708
into law enforcement agencies
and government agencies,

01:17:20.741 --> 01:17:24.745
and you, a 16-year-old girl,

01:17:24.778 --> 01:17:27.648
you singlehandedly took out
one of their cells.

01:17:29.884 --> 01:17:31.152
One of them escaped.

01:17:32.486 --> 01:17:34.788
DJ Turner.

01:17:34.822 --> 01:17:36.223
Don't worry, we'll find him.

01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:41.362
What do you want?

01:17:41.395 --> 01:17:43.731
Just want to ask you
two questions.

01:17:44.865 --> 01:17:46.867
If you answer yes
to the first question,

01:17:46.901 --> 01:17:48.369
I'll move on
to the second question,

01:17:48.402 --> 01:17:51.038
but if you answer no
to the first question,

01:17:51.071 --> 01:17:53.207
then I will be unable to reveal
the second question,

01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:54.942
I will shake your hand,
I will thank you

01:17:54.975 --> 01:17:56.944
for the service you've performed
for your country,

01:17:56.977 --> 01:17:58.812
the CIA will forget
about all this,

01:17:58.846 --> 01:18:01.348
and you can go back
to living your life.

01:18:03.184 --> 01:18:04.952
So, what do you think?

01:18:04.985 --> 01:18:07.288
Would you like to hear
the first question?

01:18:07.321 --> 01:18:09.323
That's not
the first question.

01:18:10.291 --> 01:18:11.792
Sure.

01:18:17.464 --> 01:18:19.033
Rebecca, would you be interested

01:18:19.066 --> 01:18:20.968
in being
the youngest ever recruit

01:18:21.001 --> 01:18:23.237
for the Central
Intelligence Agency?

01:18:28.242 --> 01:18:29.310
Fine.

01:18:29.343 --> 01:18:32.213
I'm looking
for a yes or no answer.

01:18:32.246 --> 01:18:33.347
Yes.

01:18:34.215 --> 01:18:35.816
Good.

01:18:35.849 --> 01:18:38.419
Then I can move on
to question number two.

01:18:40.020 --> 01:18:41.388
Are you ready to find out

01:18:41.422 --> 01:18:43.123
what this belongs to?

01:18:45.426 --> 01:18:46.860
Yes.

01:18:52.233 --> 01:18:54.735
Now where's my fucking dog?

01:19:04.245 --> 01:19:07.281
Okay, check engine.

01:19:07.314 --> 01:19:11.352
Well, there's engine oil,
there's oil.

01:19:12.253 --> 01:19:14.421
Something...

01:19:16.957 --> 01:19:18.359
Piece of shit.

01:20:24.258 --> 01:20:25.292
Oh, f--
