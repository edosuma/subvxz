WEBVTT

00:08.833 --> 00:10.875
Cha-chung!

00:18.500 --> 00:19.750
Hm.

00:19.833 --> 00:21.708
-For Teca!

00:29.458 --> 00:31.125
-What?

00:37.500 --> 00:39.416
-Oh, ho, ho!

00:56.208 --> 00:57.041
-Ay!

01:06.791 --> 01:08.875
-Whoo-ha!

01:14.916 --> 01:17.000
Had enough?

01:17.083 --> 01:18.083
Hmm.

01:31.083 --> 01:31.916
Huh?

01:41.750 --> 01:42.625
Who are you?

01:51.291 --> 01:53.250
What were you thinking?!

01:53.333 --> 01:55.750
-I made this for you, mi amor.

01:55.833 --> 01:59.541
Spawn of a human
and the goddess of death.

02:00.916 --> 02:04.083
The one thing that could
actually hurt me.

02:04.166 --> 02:06.291
-Hmm.

02:09.916 --> 02:11.958
-Give me that thing.
-Wait, my dear.

02:12.041 --> 02:16.208
-If you sacrifice my half-divine child…

02:16.291 --> 02:19.333
-…it will increase your power immensely.

02:20.041 --> 02:23.125
-Ah, you think of everything, mi amor.

02:28.541 --> 02:31.500
-Oh, yes. Sacrificing her now…

02:31.583 --> 02:33.708
…would increase your power, my love.

02:33.791 --> 02:36.666
-But not as much as it would…
-Huh?

02:36.750 --> 02:40.291
-…if you sacrifice her when she was grown.

02:40.375 --> 02:43.833
You know, sacrifices are more effective
when they're ripe.

02:43.916 --> 02:46.958
-Why don't you wait, my sweet?

02:47.041 --> 02:49.916
I'll send her to the land of the living.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.375
-Let the Tecas raise her.

02:52.458 --> 02:56.208
You can have her when she's, say, 15.

02:56.291 --> 02:57.208
Yeah.

02:57.291 --> 03:00.083
Give them plenty of time
to fall in love with it

03:01.250 --> 03:03.583
before we rip it away for my sacrifice.

03:05.500 --> 03:09.875
My husband, you are the master
of inflicting pain.

03:09.958 --> 03:10.791
Just think…

03:10.875 --> 03:15.291
…the Tecas will have to do
all the work of raising it.

03:15.375 --> 03:17.000
They will be like our servants.

03:17.083 --> 03:17.958
Mmm.

03:18.041 --> 03:19.125
And it will never know…

03:19.208 --> 03:21.166
-…who its true mother is.

03:21.250 --> 03:23.958
-You will be nothing to it. Nothing.

03:24.041 --> 03:25.291
Nothing at all.

03:26.375 --> 03:27.583
Magnifico.

03:27.666 --> 03:29.833
-I'll send her off now.

03:42.291 --> 03:44.958
Mmm.

04:45.500 --> 04:46.333
Huh?

04:48.041 --> 04:50.583
Ooh.

04:59.208 --> 05:00.291
Whoo!

05:31.625 --> 05:32.541
-Ah!

05:56.750 --> 05:59.791
-Oh my gods.

05:59.875 --> 06:01.666
The Divine Gate!

06:01.750 --> 06:04.291
The door between our realm
and the underworld.

06:05.666 --> 06:09.416
To think we're the first living humans
to pass through this gate.

06:09.500 --> 06:11.916
We're the warriors
from the Great Prophecy.

06:12.416 --> 06:16.250
The story will be told for generations
of how we, Maya and the Three,

06:16.333 --> 06:17.875
vanquished the god of war.

06:17.958 --> 06:19.500
Onward, my warriors!

06:19.583 --> 06:21.375
-Onward!

06:26.000 --> 06:27.458
-Ah?

06:31.958 --> 06:34.791
This was supposed to be
the portal to the underworld.

06:35.291 --> 06:37.833
But it's just, what?
Shade for forest animals?

06:38.833 --> 06:39.916
What we do now?

06:40.000 --> 06:41.708
We need to activate the gate somehow.

06:41.791 --> 06:43.750
Maybe our talismans will do it.

06:43.833 --> 06:45.458
-Eagle Claw!

06:45.541 --> 06:47.333
-Slice and Dice!
-Bow!

06:47.416 --> 06:50.416
-Estefan! Open, says me!

06:54.333 --> 06:55.250
Think, Maya.

06:55.333 --> 06:58.250
Why isn't it letting us through
to the underworld?

06:58.333 --> 07:01.208
-Puma Punch! Puma Punch!

07:01.291 --> 07:02.375
Hmm!

07:02.458 --> 07:04.291
-Hmm…

07:04.375 --> 07:06.458
-Huh.

07:23.791 --> 07:26.875
We can't have come
all this way for nothing.

07:31.875 --> 07:33.458
Please, Divine Gate.

07:34.875 --> 07:35.958
My whole life,

07:36.708 --> 07:39.500
all I ever wanted was to meet my mother.

07:45.041 --> 07:46.416
-Of course.
-Ooh!

07:47.208 --> 07:49.125
Living people don't cross
through the gate.

07:49.208 --> 07:52.625
It responds to the only thing
you have left when you die!

07:52.708 --> 07:55.166
Ch-Ch-Chimi, let it hear your soul.

08:40.875 --> 08:42.958
Maybe we-- we should have
just let her sleep.

08:46.541 --> 08:49.083
No wonder no human
has ever gone through the gate alive.

08:49.166 --> 08:50.833
-Eat death!

08:53.083 --> 08:54.208
Whoa!

08:54.291 --> 08:56.125
-Mm. Should've seen that coming.

08:58.166 --> 09:01.708
-Bolas de fuego, incinerate!

09:02.916 --> 09:04.916
-Hmm?

09:11.208 --> 09:14.041
-Chiapa! Hold on!

09:15.583 --> 09:16.833
-Huh?

09:18.041 --> 09:20.625
-Divine Gate hurt big cat.

09:26.041 --> 09:28.916
Mercury amalgamation
can extract silver from finely crushed--

09:29.000 --> 09:31.333
-Why Picchu head hurt?

09:45.875 --> 09:49.208
Picchu! Chimi!
Can you hold the gate still for a minute?

09:59.291 --> 10:01.791
-Can you get me up to its chest?
-I guess so, but why?

10:01.875 --> 10:04.291
-You'll see.

10:13.541 --> 10:14.375
Now!

10:14.458 --> 10:17.583
-Extendenae!

10:32.833 --> 10:34.416
Ah!

10:39.166 --> 10:40.500
Thank you, Chimi!

10:45.333 --> 10:47.750
-This better work, Lady Micte.

10:55.416 --> 10:58.000
You see? I knew this would be easy.

10:58.083 --> 11:00.458
-Oh yeah. Super easy.

11:00.541 --> 11:01.666
Uh-huh.

11:01.750 --> 11:02.916
Whoa!

11:16.958 --> 11:20.666
Anyone doesn't wanna go through,
now is the time to say so.

11:20.750 --> 11:25.583
-Picchu stick with you to end.
-You're not getting rid of me now.

11:25.666 --> 11:28.208
Of course I don't wanna go.
Are you serious?

11:28.291 --> 11:31.083
But yeah.
Yeah, I'm going. Of course I'm going.

11:31.583 --> 11:36.458
Chiapa, I know you wanna go with us,
but you've done enough by getting us here.

11:36.541 --> 11:38.666
-And you're hurt.

11:42.208 --> 11:44.250
-The healers will mend you,

11:44.333 --> 11:46.208
so go home to Mama and Papa.

11:46.291 --> 11:48.625
-They need you. Protect them.

11:49.583 --> 11:51.125
-Thank you, old friend.

11:51.208 --> 11:53.125
-Picchu love giant cat.

11:53.875 --> 11:55.875
Thanks for not eating me, Chiapa.

12:11.416 --> 12:14.083
-All right.

12:14.166 --> 12:16.791
-Let's go kill the god of war.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.708
Holy cacao.

12:34.333 --> 12:35.750
Whoa.

12:35.833 --> 12:36.916
You know what?

12:37.000 --> 12:40.375
-Uh, I think I hear Chiapa calling me.

12:41.666 --> 12:43.916
-Ah! What?

12:44.000 --> 12:47.291
I was just going to check up on him.
Ugh, fine.

12:47.875 --> 12:50.875
Wh-Which way is up? Never mind.
Know what? I don't wanna know.

12:55.958 --> 12:58.333
-Hola, mis niños!

12:58.416 --> 13:00.666
-Ah Puch! Ay, thank the gods.

13:00.750 --> 13:01.625
Huh?

13:01.708 --> 13:02.625
Huh?

13:02.708 --> 13:05.416
-What took you so long?
-What took-- What took you so long?

13:05.500 --> 13:09.625
We had to fight
a four-armed stone monster creature!

13:09.708 --> 13:12.333
Ah, one of our more gifted children.

13:12.416 --> 13:15.291
-Oh?
-Wait, don't you speak in rhymes?

13:15.375 --> 13:16.833
Some of me does.

13:16.916 --> 13:17.958
-Huh?

13:18.041 --> 13:20.458
Ah Puch, I would like
for you to meet my friends.

13:20.541 --> 13:23.041
-Chimi, our tragic Chimi.

13:23.125 --> 13:26.500
-My heart has always ached for you.

13:26.583 --> 13:30.000
-Our nature is to watch, but for you,

13:30.083 --> 13:32.041
perhaps we interfered.

13:32.125 --> 13:33.375
How do you know my name?

13:33.458 --> 13:36.958
We gave you your name, my child.
We know you by heart.

13:39.083 --> 13:41.041
I liked that. That's weird.

13:41.125 --> 13:43.791
-Our precious Rico.

13:43.875 --> 13:45.708
Chimi had her animal friends.

13:45.791 --> 13:47.500
You only had Estefan

13:47.583 --> 13:51.500
-and your own spark to keep you company.

13:51.583 --> 13:53.958
Good thing you have plenty of it, my son.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.250
You'll never be alone again,

13:57.333 --> 14:01.166
once you know your true worth.

14:03.500 --> 14:05.000
Our sweet Picchu.

14:05.083 --> 14:08.375
For so long you danced
with the shadows of your pain.

14:08.458 --> 14:11.250
-But now you see

14:11.333 --> 14:14.375
that mercy is your true gift.

14:16.666 --> 14:17.583
Oh.

14:17.666 --> 14:20.916
Thank you, nice nature lady. Agh!

14:21.000 --> 14:22.166
Ay, Maya.

14:22.250 --> 14:26.125
I remember when we guided you
from the underworld to your parents.

14:26.208 --> 14:28.708
So innocent then.

14:28.791 --> 14:33.291
-Oh!
-But now, you have no plan.

14:33.375 --> 14:36.166
-Only your golden talisman,

14:36.250 --> 14:38.875
vengeance and arrogance.

14:38.958 --> 14:40.583
But it's not too late to turn back.

14:42.541 --> 14:45.666
We're taking Lord Mictlan down,
and no one can stop us.

14:45.750 --> 14:46.875
Ugh.

14:46.958 --> 14:48.916
We can't interfere.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.666
But know this,

14:50.750 --> 14:56.291
it is hard to find one's way to light
on a path that runs through darkness.

14:58.750 --> 15:00.375
Will you help us, Ah Puch?

15:00.458 --> 15:03.041
-Bats! Bats! Bats!

15:07.041 --> 15:08.000
Oy, oy.

15:11.250 --> 15:15.125
-His hair say "trying too hard."

15:15.208 --> 15:18.208
His hair is like the wings
of a beautiful dove. Huh?

15:22.833 --> 15:25.375
Princess Maya, I prayed you would make it.

15:25.458 --> 15:27.958
Look, if you're here
to ask me to join your quest--

15:28.041 --> 15:29.500
No, no, no.

15:29.583 --> 15:31.291
I ask to join yours.

15:33.750 --> 15:35.750
You're not a part of the prophecy,

15:35.833 --> 15:40.041
but maybe you can keep Lady Micte occupied
while we finish her husband.

15:44.916 --> 15:47.291
Plus, I don't really know where I'm going.

15:47.375 --> 15:50.000
Don't worry. I know the way.

15:50.083 --> 15:50.916
Ah Puch, we--

15:51.500 --> 15:54.166
Ah Puch? Ah Puch!

15:54.250 --> 15:56.875
-Where'd she go?
-Oy!

15:56.958 --> 15:58.291
Adios, Ah Puch!

15:58.375 --> 16:00.625
Bye, nice nature lady.

16:01.625 --> 16:04.625
Come now. It is time
for us to face Lord Mictlan.

16:04.708 --> 16:06.125
-Huh?

16:07.791 --> 16:11.750
You sure we can trust this guy?
He could be leading us into a trap.

16:11.833 --> 16:13.750
We're already marching
up to the god of war

16:13.833 --> 16:16.083
and challenging him
to a fight to the death.

16:16.166 --> 16:18.500
How could Zatz make him more dangerous?

16:18.583 --> 16:20.708
I hope we don't find out.

16:23.041 --> 16:25.791
-Come on. Ride with me.
-I thought you'd never ask.

16:25.875 --> 16:28.291
-My plan is simple.

16:28.375 --> 16:31.375
We bypass the main entrance
to Lord Mictlan's temple

16:31.458 --> 16:33.875
and make our way through the fire tunnels.

16:33.958 --> 16:36.708
Yeah. It's great.
That's-- That's really great.

16:36.791 --> 16:37.875
Here's my plan.

16:37.958 --> 16:41.958
We pretend to be your prisoners,
walk up to Lord Mictlan, and surprise!

16:42.041 --> 16:44.375
I challenge him to a fight to the death.

16:44.458 --> 16:46.833
-Boom!
-Maya, please.

16:46.916 --> 16:47.958
Seriously?

16:48.041 --> 16:50.458
I already killed a god, so we got this.

16:50.541 --> 16:54.166
You don't know what you're up against.
Lord Mictlan is the god of war.

16:54.250 --> 16:58.458
Hey, you asked to join my quest.
So we're gonna do this my way.

16:58.541 --> 17:01.708
I don't like you taking such a risk, Maya.

17:11.500 --> 17:13.791
-Whoa.
-Lord Mictlan's temple.

17:16.125 --> 17:19.375
-You gotta be kidding me. Ah!

17:19.458 --> 17:20.666
Ooh…

17:25.625 --> 17:28.833
Please, don't kill me, brothers.

17:28.916 --> 17:31.750
-Por favor!

17:32.958 --> 17:35.000
Please, Lord Mictlan, I beg you.

17:37.458 --> 17:39.958
Isn't she wonderful, General Camazotz?

17:45.333 --> 17:46.166
Zatz?

18:06.666 --> 18:07.791
Bravo, Zatz.

18:07.875 --> 18:08.958
You've succeeded.

18:09.958 --> 18:13.250
-You finally brought me that half-breed.

18:15.375 --> 18:16.708
Zatz did not bring me.

18:17.708 --> 18:19.291
Zatz stands with me.

18:19.875 --> 18:22.750
I have joined her quest, you monster.

18:25.958 --> 18:29.041
I send you out to fetch her,
and you join her?

18:29.125 --> 18:31.000
And I see you've brought mortals

18:31.083 --> 18:32.458
-from Luna Island…

18:32.541 --> 18:33.416
…the Jungle Lands,

18:33.500 --> 18:35.291
-and the Golden Mountains.

18:35.375 --> 18:38.541
Know this, if you stand against me,

18:38.625 --> 18:41.541
your kingdoms will pay the price.

18:42.500 --> 18:44.791
Lord Mictlan, god of war,

18:45.416 --> 18:48.375
murderer of my brothers and my people,

18:48.458 --> 18:52.375
I, Princess Maya,
along with my three friends…

18:52.458 --> 18:54.000
-…challenge you

18:54.083 --> 18:56.916
-to a battle to the death!

18:57.000 --> 18:57.875
Hm!

18:57.958 --> 18:58.916
Impressive.

19:01.250 --> 19:02.083
Friends?

19:02.166 --> 19:03.708
-Oh no!

19:06.583 --> 19:08.875
You have brought the power of friendship.

19:12.125 --> 19:13.708
Ay, I am doomed!

19:15.500 --> 19:16.708
Maya,

19:16.791 --> 19:22.083
let me show you and your friends
just how pathetic you are.

19:22.166 --> 19:23.875
-I'll start with Zatz.

19:25.625 --> 19:28.041
He, at least,
should have known the depths

19:28.125 --> 19:30.833
-of your stupidity.

19:30.916 --> 19:31.750
Zatz!

19:31.833 --> 19:33.750
-Let him go!

19:33.833 --> 19:34.833
-Agh!

19:34.916 --> 19:37.916
Your reign ends here!

19:38.000 --> 19:39.208
For Zyanya!

19:42.125 --> 19:43.416
Oh, General Camazotz,

19:43.500 --> 19:45.541
-did you really think I didn't know…

19:45.625 --> 19:47.666
…you and your son
were plotting against me?

19:53.541 --> 19:55.333
-No!

19:57.083 --> 19:59.250
-I am the wrath of Teca!

20:05.208 --> 20:08.833
-You will pay for this, Mictlan.

20:08.916 --> 20:12.083
-You will pay for this!

20:12.166 --> 20:13.875
Relax, Zatz.

20:13.958 --> 20:16.041
-All of you, relax.

20:16.125 --> 20:17.375
-Enjoy the show.
-Huh?

20:18.625 --> 20:20.791
-What show, mi amor?

20:20.875 --> 20:23.708
I thought Maya might like
to learn how her brothers fell.

20:25.083 --> 20:28.833
I promise you,
I did not harm them one bit. No. No.

20:28.916 --> 20:31.291
They were killed
by their own loyal friends.

20:31.375 --> 20:32.541
You lie!

20:32.625 --> 20:34.083
I can be very…

20:34.166 --> 20:36.708
…how you say, persuasive.

20:39.750 --> 20:40.750
Oh no.

20:41.291 --> 20:43.500
-Die, Maya. Die!

20:43.583 --> 20:45.958
-Rico, stop!
-Die, Maya. Die.

20:46.041 --> 20:47.833
-Die, Maya. Die.

20:49.958 --> 20:51.458
-Picchu, it's me.

20:51.541 --> 20:54.833
-Rico, don't do this!
-Ha!

21:01.458 --> 21:02.875
-Whoa!

21:02.958 --> 21:05.250
-I'm so sorry, Picchu. I'm sorry.

21:05.333 --> 21:07.458
-Maya, watch out!

21:11.583 --> 21:13.291
-Behind you!

21:17.291 --> 21:18.291
Ooh!

21:18.375 --> 21:20.458
-Sorry, Chimi.

21:21.750 --> 21:23.958
-Perdon, Picchu!

21:24.041 --> 21:26.958
-I don't have much choice.

21:27.041 --> 21:28.333
-Hm!

21:30.708 --> 21:33.166
Un hechizo spells your doom…

21:33.250 --> 21:35.916
Rico, no. Fight it!
Fight it, gallito!

21:36.000 --> 21:40.416
Swirl around, entonces boom!

21:41.166 --> 21:44.541
-Un hechizo spells your doom.

21:44.625 --> 21:48.041
Swirl around, entonces boom!

21:53.958 --> 21:55.333
Calma, calma.

21:55.416 --> 21:58.833
-Calma. Calma, gallito, calma.

21:58.916 --> 22:02.416
Calma. Calma. Calma, gallito.

22:03.958 --> 22:06.583
Obey me, Rooster Wizard.

22:08.208 --> 22:11.166
-No! I'm the Rooster Wizard.

22:12.041 --> 22:13.333
Huh?

22:18.375 --> 22:20.000
How could you be that strong?

22:23.125 --> 22:25.333
-Can you get them back to normal?

22:25.416 --> 22:27.708
-Huh?
-Just try, okay? I'll keep them busy.

22:28.500 --> 22:30.791
Despiértase from this trance.

22:30.875 --> 22:32.875
-Escúchame, make your stance.

22:32.958 --> 22:35.750
-Despiértase from this trance.

22:37.041 --> 22:39.208
-Escúchame, make your stance.

22:39.291 --> 22:40.833
-Huh?

22:42.208 --> 22:44.500
-What a-- What-- What happening?

22:44.583 --> 22:47.375
Let's see if this prophecy
is true after all.

22:48.041 --> 22:51.500
Together, we're unbeatable.
Let's go kill the god of war.

22:54.416 --> 22:56.375
I'm glad we didn't sacrifice her

22:56.458 --> 22:59.250
-when she was just an infant, mi amor.

22:59.333 --> 23:01.208
This is going to be so much more fun.

23:01.291 --> 23:04.000
I like when my prey
have a little fight in them.

23:04.500 --> 23:06.083
Sí, mi amor.

23:06.166 --> 23:09.000
It's god-smashing time!

23:10.333 --> 23:12.208
-To battle!
-Agh!

23:12.291 --> 23:13.375
Eat death!

23:18.250 --> 23:21.875
-Feel the power de mas de mil manos!

23:33.500 --> 23:35.500
You insolent fools.

23:38.625 --> 23:40.541
-I got you.

23:42.125 --> 23:43.958
-I got you, Maya!

23:44.041 --> 23:46.541
I am the Teca Eagle!

23:50.958 --> 23:52.500
-Ah!

23:56.000 --> 23:57.833
-Should we help Lord Mictlan?

23:57.916 --> 24:00.500
Sorry, evil gods.

24:00.583 --> 24:02.750
-He's not going to lose.

24:09.333 --> 24:11.125
-Ahh! This is for my brothers!

24:26.250 --> 24:28.208
-Why must you annoy me so?

24:36.750 --> 24:38.375
-Huh?

24:39.416 --> 24:42.625
-Hmm?
-Dragón mágico, fire away.

24:43.333 --> 24:46.500
-Mictlan malvado, time to pay!

24:48.375 --> 24:50.708
-Now, my misbegotten princess,

24:50.791 --> 24:54.041
it is time for you to fulfill
your one and only purpose.

24:54.125 --> 24:55.500
Let her go!

24:57.291 --> 24:58.208
-Maya?

24:58.291 --> 24:59.708
Your sacrifice,

24:59.791 --> 25:03.208
thanks to your goddess mother
and your human father,

25:03.291 --> 25:06.750
will make me
the most powerful being in all the realms!

25:09.041 --> 25:10.208
Be still, princess.

25:14.541 --> 25:17.000
Your sacrifice will be a great honor.

25:17.083 --> 25:18.791
-Lord Mictlan,

25:18.875 --> 25:21.750
-I beseech you, sacrifice me instead.

25:21.833 --> 25:22.916
Maya!

25:24.833 --> 25:26.583
Lost gods of the underworld…

25:27.625 --> 25:29.791
…I honor you with this sacrifice.

25:30.958 --> 25:33.333
-Why didn't this work?

25:33.416 --> 25:35.083
-We are the prophecy.

25:35.791 --> 25:36.958
-Huh?

25:43.666 --> 25:46.250
-Oh no! Mi amor!

25:46.333 --> 25:48.916
-Die, you monster!

25:49.000 --> 25:51.041
-Chimi!
-Get it out!

25:51.125 --> 25:52.083
-Get it out!

25:56.625 --> 25:58.291
-Go!

25:58.875 --> 26:00.125
Mi amor!

26:00.208 --> 26:02.208
-Oh, let me help you!

26:03.083 --> 26:04.500
-Get it out!
-Stay still.

26:05.083 --> 26:07.166
I always told you
this would happen.

26:08.083 --> 26:10.250
-Maya, we must go.

26:10.333 --> 26:12.250
-How are we not dead?

26:12.333 --> 26:14.208
Get it out!

26:28.458 --> 26:29.583
Finish him!

26:29.666 --> 26:32.041
-Listen to me. We have to go.

26:32.125 --> 26:34.666
-We have to make sure he's dead.

26:34.750 --> 26:37.833
-Rico's hurt too.
-This might be the only chance we get.

26:37.916 --> 26:39.250
Please, Maya.

26:40.750 --> 26:42.083
-But I--

26:42.166 --> 26:43.875
No time talk. Time go.

26:44.375 --> 26:45.916
No! No!

26:46.541 --> 26:47.583
This is our chance!

26:52.125 --> 26:55.250
-Picchu. Picchu, stop! Put me down.

26:57.625 --> 26:59.291
-After them!

27:00.791 --> 27:02.416
Oh no.

27:04.791 --> 27:06.958
We'll never make it back
to the Divine Gate.

27:09.916 --> 27:10.833
Colmillo!

27:15.083 --> 27:17.750
-Jump on, Picchu.
-I'm too big!

27:25.666 --> 27:28.208
-You won't get away, chamacos!

27:29.500 --> 27:30.458
I got this.

27:33.916 --> 27:36.166
End of the line, mocosos!

27:38.333 --> 27:40.916
-Once I sacrifice you, half-breed…

27:41.000 --> 27:43.791
-…things will be so much different.

27:43.875 --> 27:46.583
With Lord Mictlan gone--

27:49.916 --> 27:51.583
What? What now?

27:58.666 --> 28:01.083
-Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go!

28:06.666 --> 28:09.250
-Colmillo, run!

28:09.833 --> 28:11.083
Get the Teca girl!

28:15.375 --> 28:17.916
-Extendenae!

28:18.541 --> 28:19.791
Picchu, grab Estefan!

28:19.875 --> 28:21.625
-I-- I trying!

28:27.625 --> 28:29.791
-Whoa!

28:40.916 --> 28:43.416
Picchu too heavy.

29:02.166 --> 29:05.416
-You can't leave us just yet!

29:10.166 --> 29:11.958
-Colmillo!

29:12.041 --> 29:13.958
-Fulmen!

29:18.625 --> 29:19.708
Let go!

29:37.375 --> 29:42.666
-I love you, familia.

29:44.833 --> 29:46.625
-Don't forget me.

29:48.291 --> 29:49.708
Picchu!

29:49.791 --> 29:52.375
No! No! No!

29:53.500 --> 29:56.541
-Barbarians!

29:56.625 --> 29:57.833
-Picchu!

30:01.458 --> 30:03.625
-Picchu!
-Owl, stop!

30:04.125 --> 30:05.500
Stop, owl!

30:06.208 --> 30:09.416
-Stop! Stop!

30:09.500 --> 30:12.500
-Get off me! Stop her!

30:15.083 --> 30:20.208
-Huh? Hold them off, Colmillo!

30:50.583 --> 30:51.500
If…

30:51.583 --> 30:53.375
-If it to be…

30:54.541 --> 30:56.500
…up to me.

30:56.583 --> 30:58.333
You fool.

30:58.416 --> 31:00.833
-I can build a new gate that will take us

31:00.916 --> 31:02.958
to the human world within a new moon.

31:03.041 --> 31:06.166
Maya will still
be mine to sacrifice.

31:06.250 --> 31:08.041
You have done nothing.

31:08.125 --> 31:09.833
Nothing?

31:09.916 --> 31:12.208
Picchu buy family time.

31:12.875 --> 31:15.250
You are dead and you just don't know it.

31:15.333 --> 31:18.541
-Better Picchu die for something

31:18.625 --> 31:20.250
than live for nothing.

31:21.500 --> 31:24.416
-Barbarians!

31:37.541 --> 31:39.416
-Huh?

31:41.333 --> 31:43.291
Picchu, you made it.

31:43.375 --> 31:44.833
Mama. Papa.

31:46.500 --> 31:47.541
Colmillo!

31:47.625 --> 31:49.125
You're a puma.

31:51.208 --> 31:52.041
Huh?

31:54.500 --> 31:56.791
We so proud of you, mijo.

31:57.500 --> 32:00.500
Picchu proud be your son.
