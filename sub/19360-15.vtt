Shane Smith:
<i>This week on</i> Vice:

00:08.941 --> 00:11.674
<i>The post-Obama
gun industry in America.</i>

00:11.709 --> 00:13.743
Man:
Shooter ready!

00:13.778 --> 00:16.546
Dan Roberts: I believe that
the movement of gun control

00:16.581 --> 00:19.316
is almost on life support.

00:21.053 --> 00:23.320
Suroosh Alvi: What's your
favorite part of your job?

00:23.355 --> 00:24.754
The fact that I make guns.

00:24.789 --> 00:26.055
- Yeah.
- I love guns.

00:26.090 --> 00:27.022
- You do?
- Yeah.

00:27.058 --> 00:29.624
Smith: <i>And then,
industries in Russia</i>

00:29.660 --> 00:33.028
<i>that plan to thrive
from climate change.</i>

00:33.064 --> 00:34.830
It's hard to deny
that climate change

00:34.865 --> 00:37.232
will be financially
beneficial for Russia.

00:39.437 --> 00:42.303
Oleg Anisimov: <i>Advances
of the agricultural lands,</i>

00:42.339 --> 00:44.772
<i>savings on the heating energy.</i>

00:44.807 --> 00:45.906
Russia is lucky.

00:52.415 --> 00:53.747
Yeung:
Go! Go! Go!

00:56.853 --> 00:58.286
Refugee:
We are not animals!

01:09.865 --> 01:11.431
During the Obama administration,

01:11.467 --> 01:15.268
firearms enthusiasts, fearing
harsh new gun control laws,

01:15.304 --> 01:17.136
<i>began snapping up inventory,</i>

01:17.171 --> 01:19.071
<i>sparking the most
profitable period</i>

01:19.107 --> 01:21.474
in the history of the American
gun industry.

01:21.509 --> 01:25.878
<i>Now, a much more gun-friendly
president is in the Oval Office.</i>

01:25.913 --> 01:28.214
I will never infringe

01:28.249 --> 01:31.083
on the right to keep
and bear arms.

01:31.119 --> 01:33.218
Never, ever.

01:33.253 --> 01:36.354
And that has manufacturers
exploring new markets

01:36.390 --> 01:39.524
and ready to cash in once again.

01:45.999 --> 01:48.133
Alvi: <i>During the eight years
of the Obama presidency,</i>

01:48.168 --> 01:51.101
<i>more guns were sold in this
country than ever before.</i>

01:51.137 --> 01:52.802
Today, we've come here
to the largest

01:52.838 --> 01:55.305
independently-owned
gun store in America

01:55.341 --> 01:57.441
<i>to learn about the future
of the gun industry.</i>

01:59.000 --> 02:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:11.122 --> 02:14.257
Alvi: All right, if you can just
tell me a little bit about the shop.

02:14.292 --> 02:16.225
Sure. My father
started back

02:16.261 --> 02:18.094
in the mid '50s as a coin shop,

02:18.129 --> 02:20.796
bought a coin collection
that had some guns with it,

02:20.831 --> 02:22.398
and that got him started
in the gun business.

02:22.434 --> 02:26.768
Alvi: Was the gun industry strong
in North Carolina back then?

02:26.803 --> 02:28.870
Nothing like today.
Most gun companies

02:28.905 --> 02:30.539
went bankrupt between wars.

02:30.574 --> 02:33.075
The history of the gun business
has been a lot of boom and bust.

02:33.110 --> 02:36.945
So, looking around, if feels like
we're in... in a boom right now.

02:36.980 --> 02:38.680
Probably one
of the biggest booms ever.

02:38.715 --> 02:42.116
Alvi: Now, how many different gun
models do you guys have here?

02:42.151 --> 02:43.484
Hyatt: Thousands.
Alvi: Thousands.

02:43.519 --> 02:46.753
Hyatt: Competition, hunting,
collecting, doomsday.

02:46.789 --> 02:48.422
- Alvi: Doomsday?
- Yes, the preppers,

02:48.458 --> 02:50.391
people that think that we
could have a nuclear attack

02:50.426 --> 02:52.059
or some type of pandemic.
Alvi: Yeah.

02:52.095 --> 02:53.227
- They're getting ready.
- Yes.

02:53.262 --> 02:55.629
Alvi: What are the most
popular guns that you sell?

02:55.664 --> 02:58.764
The most popular gun
is the AR-15 type,

02:58.800 --> 03:00.133
the military-looking gun.

03:00.168 --> 03:02.435
Bring it inside your
shoulder just a little bit.

03:05.240 --> 03:06.739
Alvi:
<i>Why do you own guns?</i>

03:06.774 --> 03:08.475
It's just like going
to the golf course.

03:08.510 --> 03:11.811
Some people go for beers.
Some people shoot AR-15s.

03:11.846 --> 03:12.945
Yeah.

03:21.155 --> 03:23.955
Alvi: <i>In the past decade,
the gun industry has grown</i>

03:23.991 --> 03:25.857
<i>by an unprecedented amount.</i>

03:25.892 --> 03:29.728
<i>There are now over 130,000
federal licenses issued</i>

03:29.763 --> 03:31.130
<i>to sell firearms in America.</i>

03:31.165 --> 03:34.632
<i>Compare that to the estimated
14,000 McDonald's nationwide,</i>

03:34.667 --> 03:37.468
<i>and you have almost 10 times
as many potential places</i>

03:37.504 --> 03:39.870
<i>to buy a gun
as you do a Big Mac.</i>

03:39.905 --> 03:41.839
<i>To accommodate this growth,</i>

03:41.874 --> 03:44.742
<i>gun manufacturing
has expanded massively.</i>

03:44.777 --> 03:48.712
So, we're at Kel-Tec. This is the
largest gun manufacturer in Florida,

03:48.748 --> 03:51.314
and one of the largest
in the country.

03:51.350 --> 03:54.451
<i>They're also the only gun
manufacturer we contacted</i>

03:54.486 --> 03:56.286
<i>who's willing
to let us film inside.</i>

03:56.321 --> 03:58.021
- Hey. Suroosh.
- Hey. How you doing?

03:58.056 --> 03:58.921
Good.
Nice to meet you.

03:58.957 --> 04:00.423
- I'm Chad.
- Nice to meet you, Chad.

04:02.361 --> 04:04.661
Enos: Step on out here.
This is our warehouse.

04:04.696 --> 04:08.730
- This is the front half of our CNC shop.
- Wow. Holy shit.

04:08.766 --> 04:09.931
Enos:
We have three shifts,

04:09.967 --> 04:11.634
and we run them
pretty much 24/7.

04:11.669 --> 04:13.001
- Alvi: Really? Wow.
- Enos: Yeah.

04:13.037 --> 04:15.437
Alvi: What's your favorite
part of your job?

04:15.473 --> 04:16.639
The fact that I make guns.

04:16.673 --> 04:17.738
- Yeah.
- I love guns.

04:17.774 --> 04:18.807
- You do?
- Yeah.

04:21.478 --> 04:23.719
He can do this with his eyes
closed at this point, right?

04:25.615 --> 04:28.749
Enos: <i>We do about
150,000 guns a year.</i>

04:28.785 --> 04:31.219
Every year, the back order
seems to get bigger.

04:31.254 --> 04:33.188
Alvi: <i>While manufacturing
work nationwide</i>

04:33.223 --> 04:35.523
<i>has declined drastically
since the '80s,</i>

04:35.559 --> 04:38.193
<i>the gun industry has
actually created more jobs,</i>

04:38.228 --> 04:40.827
<i>growing 81 percent since 2008.</i>

04:40.862 --> 04:43.430
What do you attribute
this growth in Kel-Tec to?

04:43.465 --> 04:45.732
Enos: I think with the political
landscape being what it was

04:45.767 --> 04:47.934
over the last eight years, people
really needed stuff, you know?

04:47.969 --> 04:49.936
They felt like their rights
were gonna be taken away,

04:49.971 --> 04:51.605
so they needed to get
this, that, and the other

04:51.640 --> 04:53.106
before they couldn't get
'em anymore.

04:57.545 --> 05:00.513
Alvi: The way the gun industry
is portrayed by the media...

05:00.548 --> 05:02.582
How does the gun industry
feel about that?

05:02.617 --> 05:05.418
We feel attacked.
You know, any time you've got

05:05.453 --> 05:08.754
a political landscape that wants
to put 260 people out of work,

05:08.789 --> 05:11.190
no matter what we're making,
that's an attack.

05:11.226 --> 05:14.693
A lot of that is perpetuated by the
media in the way they cover these...

05:14.728 --> 05:16.228
you know, these "mass shootings"

05:16.263 --> 05:17.562
and these terrible things
that happen.

05:17.598 --> 05:21.132
Alvi: <i>So, why do gun sales go
up after mass shootings then?</i>

05:21.167 --> 05:24.569
Enos: <i>Every time that happens,
the public that owns firearms,</i>

05:24.605 --> 05:27.004
<i>they want to get those things
before they get banned.</i>

05:27.040 --> 05:29.207
Alvi: <i>The phenomenon
Chad describes</i>

05:29.243 --> 05:30.975
<i>actually defined the Obama era.</i>

05:31.010 --> 05:35.011
Obama: <i>As a country, we have been
through this too many times,</i>

05:35.047 --> 05:37.681
and we're gonna have to come
together and take meaningful action

05:37.717 --> 05:39.516
<i>to prevent
more tragedies like this,</i>

05:39.552 --> 05:41.619
<i>regardless of the politics.</i>

05:41.654 --> 05:44.154
Alvi: <i>While Obama was pushing
for tougher gun control laws</i>

05:44.189 --> 05:46.557
<i>after Sandy Hook,
the three largest gun makers</i>

05:46.592 --> 05:51.361
<i>earned a record-breaking $247 million
in profits the following year.</i>

05:51.396 --> 05:54.029
<i>The years 2009 to 2016</i>

05:54.065 --> 05:56.999
<i>have been referred to
as the Barack boom.</i>

05:57.034 --> 05:59.302
<i>When five of the 10
deadliest mass shootings</i>

05:59.337 --> 06:01.437
<i>in recent American
history occurred</i>

06:01.473 --> 06:03.640
<i>and gun sales nearly doubled.</i>

06:03.675 --> 06:07.008
It's not even the fact that a particular
firearm was used in a shooting.

06:07.043 --> 06:08.076
It's the fact
that everyone's scared

06:08.111 --> 06:10.279
that the government's
gonna ban that particular gun.

06:11.548 --> 06:15.150
Alvi: <i>Now, circumstances
have fundamentally changed.</i>

06:15.185 --> 06:17.085
Trump:
<i>The eight-year assault</i>

06:17.120 --> 06:19.454
on your Second Amendment
freedoms

06:19.490 --> 06:23.724
has come to a crashing end.

06:23.760 --> 06:25.693
Alvi:
<i>Donald Trump's win insured</i>

06:25.728 --> 06:28.095
<i>that no gun control laws
would be forthcoming,</i>

06:28.130 --> 06:29.363
<i>which sent gun stocks</i>

06:29.399 --> 06:30.731
<i>into a downward spiral.</i>

06:30.767 --> 06:32.566
<i>Without the fear of gun control,</i>

06:32.602 --> 06:34.234
<i>the firearms industry is missing</i>

06:34.270 --> 06:36.370
<i>its greatest
marketing tool ever,</i>

06:36.406 --> 06:37.971
<i>so they're having to innovate.</i>

06:38.007 --> 06:38.872
<i>And there's no better way</i>

06:38.908 --> 06:41.040
<i>to insure the future security
of an industry</i>

06:41.075 --> 06:43.343
<i>than appealing to the next generation.</i>

06:48.617 --> 06:50.450
Good finish.
All right.

06:50.485 --> 06:52.319
Man: Show me clear.

06:52.354 --> 06:53.486
Cool as ice.

06:53.522 --> 06:56.755
Leia Edmonds: She competes
against retired military,

06:56.791 --> 06:58.624
active duty law enforcement,

06:58.659 --> 06:59.958
- border patrol.
- Mmm.

06:59.993 --> 07:01.827
I get asked all the time,
"Oh my gosh,

07:01.862 --> 07:03.429
are you worried
when she starts dating?"

07:03.464 --> 07:05.397
And I go...
"Not at all."

07:05.433 --> 07:07.899
Man: Shooter ready?
Standby.

07:11.539 --> 07:13.604
Dan: <i>Last year at the Smith
& Wesson Nationals,</i>

07:13.640 --> 07:16.541
<i>she placed fourth in the
country in pre-teen rifle.</i>

07:16.576 --> 07:17.908
<i>That's big.</i>

07:20.880 --> 07:21.912
Excellent!

07:21.948 --> 07:23.681
At last year's NRA convention,

07:23.717 --> 07:27.251
one of her sponsors advertised
appearances at their booth for her.

07:27.286 --> 07:29.019
And I was stunned.
I turned around,

07:29.055 --> 07:30.954
and there was a line
of 40 adults

07:30.989 --> 07:33.022
that were lined up to get
her autograph.

07:33.058 --> 07:37.861
Two hours of just signing autographs.
Now, that's insane.

07:37.896 --> 07:40.163
Alvi: <i>Industry-sponsored
organizations</i>

07:40.198 --> 07:41.931
<i>donate tens
of millions of dollars</i>

07:41.967 --> 07:43.834
<i>to youth shooting
programs every year.</i>

07:43.869 --> 07:45.101
<i>And just like the "X" Games</i>

07:45.136 --> 07:47.570
<i>did for skateboarders,
these shooting leagues</i>

07:47.605 --> 07:49.405
<i>have transformed
their young participants</i>

07:49.440 --> 07:52.040
<i>into branding gold
for gun businesses.</i>

07:52.076 --> 07:55.310
Edmonds: Alamo Tactical have
sponsored two pistols for her.

07:55.346 --> 07:58.514
Molon Labe custom-built
her AR-15s.

07:58.549 --> 08:01.283
Blade Tech provide all
of the magazine holders,

08:01.318 --> 08:03.051
the gun belts,
the different holsters,

08:03.087 --> 08:05.653
Gun For Hire, for the last
three years running,

08:05.689 --> 08:08.022
has given her a check
for $5,000 a year

08:08.057 --> 08:11.760
- to help cover expenses.
- That's why his logo's so, so big.

08:11.795 --> 08:13.961
In a lot of ways,
it's like NASCAR.

08:13.997 --> 08:16.631
The more you contribute,
the bigger you get

08:16.666 --> 08:18.700
advertised on the jersey.
Yeah.

08:18.735 --> 08:21.402
Alvi: <i>Shyanne and Vanessa don't
just shoot competitively,</i>

08:21.437 --> 08:25.171
<i>they're also part of an organization
cofounded by Shyanne's father</i>

08:25.207 --> 08:28.742
<i>that advocates for gun rights known
as Youth Shooters of America.</i>

08:36.652 --> 08:41.120
So, Shyanne, you spoke to the New Jersey
senate when you were 10 years old?

08:41.155 --> 08:44.424
- About what?
- 'Cause at the time, they were trying to lower

08:44.459 --> 08:45.958
the magazine limits
to 10 rounds,

08:45.993 --> 08:50.830
and I was saying how that could
potentially hurt my career,

08:50.865 --> 08:53.165
and I no longer would be
able to do it in that state

08:53.200 --> 08:55.167
if they had passed that law.

08:55.202 --> 08:58.336
And what happened? They didn't pass it.
They vetoed it.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.739
Alvi: <i>In their fight
for broader gun laws,</i>

09:00.774 --> 09:01.840
<i>these kids have become</i>

09:01.875 --> 09:04.275
<i>America's youngest
gun lobbyists.</i>

09:04.311 --> 09:05.877
Meredith:
<i>Hey, guys...</i>

09:09.483 --> 09:12.783
Are we going to see
the normalization of...

09:13.886 --> 09:16.219
guns in this country
on some level?

09:16.255 --> 09:19.289
I believe that the
movement of gun control...

09:20.159 --> 09:22.993
is... almost
on life support.

09:23.028 --> 09:27.164
I think we have a four-year
window that, if we do it right,

09:27.199 --> 09:31.434
we could actually put
a serious, serious...

09:32.938 --> 09:34.871
setback on gun control.

09:34.906 --> 09:38.975
Alvi: <i> The next phase in the gun
rights movement has already begun.</i>

09:39.010 --> 09:40.577
<i>This year, two separate bills</i>

09:40.612 --> 09:42.378
<i>were introduced before Congress,</i>

09:42.413 --> 09:45.214
<i>which would greatly expand the
rights of concealed carriers,</i>

09:45.249 --> 09:47.649
<i>effectively erasing
many gun-free zones</i>

09:47.685 --> 09:49.918
<i>within public schools
and government lands.</i>

09:49.954 --> 09:53.522
<i>And the firearms industry is already
in lockstep with this legislation</i>

09:53.557 --> 09:55.824
<i>as they accessorize
to meet the needs</i>

09:55.860 --> 09:57.659
<i>of the concealed-carry
consumer.</i>

09:57.695 --> 09:58.994
Man:
It's a breakaway opening.

09:59.029 --> 10:02.297
Everything is hidden under the waistband.
Man 2: Oh, I see.

10:02.332 --> 10:05.432
I can just snap
my wrist and draw.

10:05.468 --> 10:09.169
Woman: <i> I created a
concealed-carry line of holsters</i>

10:09.205 --> 10:10.805
<i>that were practical for women.</i>

10:10.840 --> 10:14.709
You wouldn't know it, but I'm actually
carrying three firearms and a knife.

10:14.744 --> 10:17.378
Man: The name of the
jacket is the Executive.

10:17.413 --> 10:19.079
I'm ready to roll.

10:19.115 --> 10:22.281
Pepper spray, a
fully-weighted 9mm Shield.

10:22.317 --> 10:25.919
Here's a knife,
and in here, magazines.

10:25.954 --> 10:28.454
Alvi: <i>Concealed carry is
growing in popularity</i>

10:28.490 --> 10:31.791
<i>as more people feel the need to protect
themselves everywhere they go,</i>

10:31.827 --> 10:35.395
<i>but what they're protecting
themselves from can vary greatly.</i>

10:35.430 --> 10:37.497
<i>Mohammad Shuayb is a dentist</i>

10:37.532 --> 10:39.297
<i>who recently decided
to conceal carry</i>

10:39.333 --> 10:40.499
<i>even at work.</i>

10:40.535 --> 10:42.100
Are you ready?
Yes.

10:42.136 --> 10:44.202
Shuayb: <i>About a year
and a half ago, I went and got</i>

10:44.238 --> 10:46.071
my concealed weapons permit.

10:46.106 --> 10:49.307
It's a .357,
and it'll do its job.

10:49.343 --> 10:50.943
It doesn't even have
a safety on it.

10:50.978 --> 10:53.245
- So, all you have to do is
pull the trigger? That's it.

10:53.280 --> 10:55.446
I will give this back to you now.

10:55.481 --> 10:57.782
Alvi: <i>Dr. Shuayb got his
concealed carry permit</i>

10:57.817 --> 11:01.019
<i>because, as a Syrian Muslim,
he felt increasingly targeted</i>

11:01.054 --> 11:02.754
<i>and in danger because of it.</i>

11:02.789 --> 11:04.556
When you walk
with your wife in the mall,

11:04.591 --> 11:06.123
you can see
how people look at her,

11:06.159 --> 11:08.893
like they just want to come
and tear her scarf off,

11:08.929 --> 11:10.461
like it's bothering them
or something.

11:10.496 --> 11:14.264
Mmm. Is the Muslim community
here feeling more targeted?

11:14.299 --> 11:16.767
Very. It's not like,
all of a sudden,

11:16.802 --> 11:20.403
<i>you have an influx of
white supremacist people.</i>

11:20.439 --> 11:23.640
<i>It's like this constant
negative rhetoric</i>

11:23.676 --> 11:25.976
<i>is infusing them with something.</i>

11:26.011 --> 11:28.844
And you never know
who's gonna switch up on you.

11:28.880 --> 11:30.646
That's why I carry it.

11:30.682 --> 11:33.883
Does it make you feel safer,
owning the gun? No. No.

11:33.918 --> 11:37.453
Having it on you makes you think
of the worst-case scenario more.

11:37.488 --> 11:41.591
It's become an environment
where nobody is comfortable.

11:41.626 --> 11:44.694
So, we're standing outside the
Islamic Society of New Tampa.

11:44.729 --> 11:47.862
This mosque was attacked
by an arsonist last week,

11:47.898 --> 11:51.066
and hate crimes like this
have been on the rise

11:51.101 --> 11:53.802
<i>since Trump started
campaigning two years ago.</i>

12:22.731 --> 12:24.097
This is the kind of stuff

12:24.132 --> 12:26.265
the community deals with.
It's...

12:27.502 --> 12:29.135
You know, our work's
been growing

12:29.170 --> 12:31.270
more important
by the day, unfortunately.

12:31.305 --> 12:33.973
I mean, we've had
a huge influx of calls for help,

12:34.009 --> 12:36.342
especially since Donald Trump
started his campaign,

12:36.377 --> 12:38.143
targeting the American-
Muslim community.

12:38.178 --> 12:39.878
If you take it back
to November of 2015,

12:39.913 --> 12:42.180
- Mm-hmm.
- Since then, unfortunately, we've documented

12:42.215 --> 12:45.316
a 500 percent increase
in anti-Muslim hate crimes.

12:45.352 --> 12:47.218
<i>Mosques being torched
and burned down</i>

12:47.254 --> 12:48.620
<i>Our own...
a mosque I go to,</i>

12:48.656 --> 12:50.055
<i>I do sermons at sometimes,</i>

12:50.090 --> 12:52.357
<i>was arsoned over
this past weekend.</i>

12:52.392 --> 12:56.994
How has the Muslim community
in Florida responded to that?

12:57.030 --> 13:00.665
Unfortunately, many of us were
pushed to start considering

13:00.700 --> 13:03.734
taking serious measures
to arm and protect ourselves.

13:03.770 --> 13:06.137
If somebody's going
to come at you,

13:06.172 --> 13:08.005
or your family,
or your house of worship,

13:08.041 --> 13:10.574
with violent intentions,
you need to be ready.

13:10.609 --> 13:11.908
Especially...
I'm giving the sermon,

13:11.943 --> 13:13.910
you see somebody walking in,
opening fire,

13:13.945 --> 13:15.278
what are you gonna do, you know?

13:15.313 --> 13:17.313
Are you gonna have
to duck for cover

13:17.348 --> 13:19.415
and watch your members
getting slaughtered?

13:19.450 --> 13:21.017
Or can you whip out your handgun

13:21.053 --> 13:24.054
and do what you have to do to keep
your community safe? Can you?

13:24.089 --> 13:26.322
Yes, and you should.

13:29.593 --> 13:30.893
Alvi:
<i>With so many millions of guns,</i>

13:30.928 --> 13:32.861
<i>being produced
and purchased every year,</i>

13:32.897 --> 13:35.064
<i>and only 10 states
requiring owners</i>

13:35.099 --> 13:37.066
<i>to report when
they get lost or stolen,</i>

13:37.101 --> 13:40.535
<i>the illegal market for guns
in America is huge.</i>

13:40.571 --> 13:43.405
<i>An upcoming Harvard-Northeastern
University study</i>

13:43.440 --> 13:46.841
<i>estimates that 400,000 guns
are stolen every year,</i>

13:46.876 --> 13:49.010
<i>many of which are sold
on the black market.</i>

13:49.045 --> 13:51.245
<i>Researchers estimate
that these illegal guns</i>

13:51.280 --> 13:54.849
<i>get used in as many as eight
out of every 10 gun crimes...</i>

13:56.886 --> 13:58.652
<i>primarily in poor, urban centers</i>

13:58.688 --> 14:01.589
<i>like Chicago,
Baltimore, and Detroit.</i>

14:08.463 --> 14:09.529
Thanks.

14:23.510 --> 14:25.711
So, where do these guns
actually come from?

14:38.792 --> 14:39.724
Alvi: Mm-hmm.

14:39.760 --> 14:41.893
Alvi: Yeah.

14:41.928 --> 14:44.662
Why don't you guys buy guns legally?
Why do you have to come here?

14:49.002 --> 14:50.869
Alvi: And are there
a lot of people like you?

15:03.115 --> 15:05.816
Alvi: <i>For years,
the Obama administration pushed</i>

15:05.851 --> 15:07.885
<i>for stricter gun control laws
under the belief</i>

15:07.920 --> 15:09.753
<i>that they would curtail crime.</i>

15:09.788 --> 15:12.922
<i>But that era has given way
to a different belief.</i>

15:12.957 --> 15:15.591
The only thing that stops

15:15.626 --> 15:17.693
a bad guy with a gun

15:17.728 --> 15:20.329
<i>is a good guy with a gun.</i>

15:20.364 --> 15:21.998
Alvi: <i>It's a belief
backed by an industry</i>

15:22.033 --> 15:24.600
<i>that values itself
at over $50 billion</i>

15:24.635 --> 15:26.935
<i>and a president that
broke spending records</i>

15:26.970 --> 15:30.571
<i>campaigning for it.</i>

15:32.442 --> 15:34.309
You know, when people
can defend themselves

15:34.344 --> 15:36.344
and their families,
we're all safer.

15:36.379 --> 15:40.182
Everyone should have a gun
that's sane, trained,

15:40.217 --> 15:43.051
and have... be able to use it
for protection.

15:43.086 --> 15:46.320
Van: <i>I will defend my right
to own a gun</i>

15:46.355 --> 15:48.655
until they take it
from my hands forcibly.

15:48.691 --> 15:50.524
I have a thousand rounds
in my closet.

15:50.559 --> 15:52.259
I hold a thousand lives
in my closet.

15:52.295 --> 15:54.594
Trump:
<i>You came through for me,</i>

15:54.630 --> 15:57.832
and I am going
to come through for you.

16:04.772 --> 16:07.640
It was only a year ago that
the COP Paris agreement

16:07.675 --> 16:10.143
was ratified with 146 countries

16:10.178 --> 16:12.078
<i>committing to limit
global warming</i>

16:12.113 --> 16:14.080
<i>to less than
two degrees Celsius.</i>

16:14.115 --> 16:16.615
<i>Now, it looked like the world
was finally coming together</i>

16:16.651 --> 16:18.650
<i>to tackle climate change.</i>

16:18.685 --> 16:20.285
But now, with President Trump

16:20.321 --> 16:22.921
<i>and his administration
of climate-change skeptics</i>

16:22.957 --> 16:25.023
<i>and pro-fossil fuel appointees,</i>

16:25.059 --> 16:27.359
America is reversing course.

16:28.295 --> 16:31.730
It is time to exit
the Paris accord.

16:33.400 --> 16:35.900
Now, to see that school of
thought already in progress,

16:35.935 --> 16:39.070
ironically, you have no
further to look than Russia,

16:39.105 --> 16:43.241
<i>a pro-energy country that sees
climate change not as a threat</i>

16:43.276 --> 16:45.609
but instead
an economic opportunity.

17:05.196 --> 17:07.530
It's not as cold as I
thought it would be here.

17:18.910 --> 17:20.675
Toboni: <i>Sergey Balmasov
helps coordinate</i>

17:20.711 --> 17:22.310
<i>shipping traffic in Murmansk,</i>

17:22.346 --> 17:23.878
<i>the world's biggest Arctic port.</i>

17:23.915 --> 17:26.381
<i>He told us that
with warming temperatures,</i>

17:26.415 --> 17:27.781
<i>the city will thrive.</i>

17:27.817 --> 17:30.184
<i>What is Murmansk known for?</i>

17:43.765 --> 17:46.166
Toboni: <i>The Northern Sea Route
is a legendary shipping lane</i>

17:46.201 --> 17:47.767
<i>along Russia's Arctic coastline</i>

17:47.803 --> 17:49.636
<i>that has been
largely inaccessible</i>

17:49.671 --> 17:51.504
<i>because of the dense sea ice.</i>

17:51.540 --> 17:53.273
<i>But now, that ice is melting,</i>

17:53.309 --> 17:57.510
<i>opening up vast, untouched reserves
of oil, gas, and minerals.</i>

17:57.546 --> 17:59.146
<i>So, while much
of the world fears</i>

17:59.181 --> 18:01.280
<i>the catastrophic effects
of climate change,</i>

18:01.316 --> 18:04.317
<i>Russia is looking
to capitalize on it.</i>

18:05.719 --> 18:09.721
This is the Murmansk port. It's
called the gateway to the Arctic.

18:09.757 --> 18:12.124
We're about to get
on this massive cargo ship

18:12.160 --> 18:13.400
that's owned by Norilsk Nickel,

18:13.428 --> 18:16.495
and we're gonna ride with them
along the Northern Sea Route

18:16.530 --> 18:19.965
as they transport
a bunch of nickel and copper

18:20.000 --> 18:22.367
to the next port city,
Arkhangelsk.

18:23.736 --> 18:25.437
<i>Norilsk Nickel,
a massive shipping</i>

18:25.472 --> 18:28.406
<i>and mining conglomerate
worth more than $20 billion</i>

18:28.442 --> 18:32.444
<i>is just one of the companies betting
big on the Northern Sea Route.</i>

18:33.347 --> 18:34.678
<i>Just a few years ago,</i>

18:34.713 --> 18:37.448
<i>navigating these waters
was extremely difficult,</i>

18:37.483 --> 18:38.849
<i>but that's changing now.</i>

18:38.884 --> 18:41.118
<i>The ice is melting away
at record rates,</i>

18:41.153 --> 18:44.388
<i>shrinking in summer months
to about a quarter of its size</i>

18:44.423 --> 18:45.990
<i>in just 30 years.</i>

18:48.760 --> 18:52.495
How much has traffic increased on the
Northern Sea Route in the last few years?

19:02.007 --> 19:03.672
Toboni: <i>Cargo ships
traveling from Russia</i>

19:03.708 --> 19:06.509
<i>have historically used the
Suez Canal to reach Asia</i>

19:06.544 --> 19:08.343
<i>navigating
around three continents,</i>

19:08.379 --> 19:10.912
<i>and often traveling
more than 10,000 miles.</i>

19:10.947 --> 19:12.947
<i>However, the Northern Sea Route</i>

19:12.983 --> 19:15.317
<i>cuts that distance
almost in half</i>

19:15.352 --> 19:18.286
<i>and can save up to 15
days in travel time.</i>

19:27.263 --> 19:30.297
Toboni: <i>And that exploitation
doesn't stop with sea routes.</i>

19:31.501 --> 19:34.168
<i>Norilsk's ability to ship
faster and cheaper</i>

19:34.203 --> 19:39.407
<i>also means stepping up
its core business, mining.</i>

19:39.442 --> 19:42.075
We're going down into Norilsk's
nickel mine right now.

19:42.110 --> 19:45.745
We're going more than a
kilometer underground.

19:57.426 --> 19:59.224
Toboni: <i>But as production
here increases,</i>

19:59.260 --> 20:01.226
<i>so does
the environmental impact.</i>

20:01.262 --> 20:02.794
What's that smell?

20:10.704 --> 20:13.038
Toboni: What are the effects
of that being released

20:13.074 --> 20:15.040
into the air,
into the environment?

20:22.949 --> 20:25.083
Toboni: <i>The difference
is Norilsk Nickel emits</i>

20:25.118 --> 20:27.418
<i>so much sulfur dioxide,
that acid rain has left</i>

20:27.454 --> 20:30.154
<i>a dead zone around the city
as far as the eye can see.</i>

20:30.190 --> 20:34.924
<i>This, combined with heavy metal waste
that seeps into the ground and the water,</i>

20:34.960 --> 20:38.661
<i>has turned Norilsk into one of the
most polluted cities on Earth.</i>

20:38.697 --> 20:41.298
<i>And while Norilsk has made
efforts to reduce its footprint,</i>

20:41.333 --> 20:43.666
<i>just last year, a chemical spill</i>

20:43.702 --> 20:45.835
<i>turned one of the local
rivers bright red.</i>

20:45.870 --> 20:48.438
<i>And studies have shown
that Norilsk's waterways</i>

20:48.474 --> 20:50.772
<i>are flush
with industrial pollution.</i>

20:50.808 --> 20:52.441
<i>But with business booming,</i>

20:52.477 --> 20:54.776
<i>residents here
don't seem to mind.</i>

20:59.283 --> 21:01.617
Is it safe to swim here?
Is it polluted?

21:01.652 --> 21:04.453
<i>Nyet.</i>

21:17.867 --> 21:19.567
Toboni: How has the
environment been affected

21:19.603 --> 21:24.005
by all the mines and the
factories and all of that?

21:43.491 --> 21:45.458
Toboni: <i>But it's not just he
locals here that are putting</i>

21:45.493 --> 21:47.560
<i>a positive spin
on the effects of pollution.</i>

21:47.595 --> 21:50.263
<i>We spoke to Nobel-prize
winning climatologist</i>

21:50.298 --> 21:52.565
<i>Dr. Oleg Anisimov,
who is studying</i>

21:52.600 --> 21:53.899
<i>what climate change could mean</i>

21:53.934 --> 21:55.301
<i>for the Russian economy.</i>

21:55.336 --> 21:56.802
We see the effects
of climate change

21:56.837 --> 21:58.870
as negative, catastrophic.

21:58.905 --> 22:00.438
Do you see it that way?

22:00.474 --> 22:02.740
No. The problem
of climate change

22:02.776 --> 22:06.044
is actually the problem of
adaptation to climate change.

22:06.079 --> 22:07.279
This is not a tragedy.

22:07.314 --> 22:10.815
Certainly, some places
will become unlivable.

22:10.850 --> 22:13.851
But on the other hand, there are
places that will become more livable.

22:13.887 --> 22:18.389
One should not consider
challenge of climate change

22:18.424 --> 22:21.124
without connection
to the potential benefits.

22:21.160 --> 22:25.496
There are regions in the world where
there are no potential benefits,

22:25.531 --> 22:27.464
but Russia is not such a region.

22:28.668 --> 22:30.501
<i>The list of gains is, perhaps,</i>

22:30.536 --> 22:34.571
<i>advances of the modern
agricultural lands to the north,</i>

22:34.606 --> 22:36.806
<i>which creates lot of jobs.</i>

22:36.841 --> 22:39.642
<i>We have savings
on the heating energy.</i>

22:39.678 --> 22:42.579
The task is to turn

22:42.614 --> 22:45.881
these potential benefits
into real benefits.

22:45.917 --> 22:47.016
Russia is lucky.

22:49.420 --> 22:51.420
Toboni: <i>And as climate
change continues to create</i>

22:51.455 --> 22:52.954
<i>new economic opportunities,</i>

22:52.989 --> 22:54.623
<i>Russia's fossil fuel industry</i>

22:54.658 --> 22:56.258
<i>is in the mood to celebrate.</i>

22:56.293 --> 22:58.227
It's National Oil Day in Russia,

22:58.262 --> 23:00.929
and we're in Surgut, which is
the oil capital of the country,

23:00.964 --> 23:02.664
and also one
of its fastest-growing cities.

23:02.700 --> 23:04.833
And Gazprom, one of the
big oil companies here,

23:04.868 --> 23:07.167
is throwing a huge celebration
for all of their workers.

23:20.983 --> 23:22.617
Toboni: <i>Not only were
residents of Surgut</i>

23:22.652 --> 23:24.351
<i>unconcerned
about climate change,</i>

23:24.386 --> 23:28.121
<i>many we spoke to felt
overwhelmingly positive about it.</i>

23:42.169 --> 23:43.835
Toboni:
<i>This nonchalant attitude</i>

23:43.871 --> 23:45.604
<i>is now a national phenomenon.</i>

23:45.640 --> 23:48.106
<i>A recent Pew study revealed
that Russians were</i>

23:48.142 --> 23:50.342
<i>the least concerned people
on the planet</i>

23:50.378 --> 23:52.578
<i>over the threat
of global climate change.</i>

23:52.613 --> 23:56.014
<i>And as the population surges
in boomtowns like Surgut,</i>

23:56.049 --> 23:57.815
<i>developers are cashing in.</i>

24:15.167 --> 24:17.801
Toboni: <i>Local real estate mogul
Evgeny Barsov</i>

24:17.836 --> 24:19.936
<i>is building whole neighborhoods
from scratch</i>

24:19.971 --> 24:21.971
<i>to accommodate
the influx of people.</i>

24:32.082 --> 24:34.517
Toboni: <i> As we looked out on his
budding real estate empire,</i>

24:34.552 --> 24:37.420
<i>Evgeny repeated familiar
arguments often used</i>

24:37.455 --> 24:39.622
<i>by fossil fuel proponents
in the US.</i>

24:39.657 --> 24:41.957
Do you ever hear about
climate change on the radio,

24:41.992 --> 24:43.992
or on TV, or in the newspaper?

24:58.475 --> 25:01.309
Toboni: <i>Not a single person
we spoke to in Surgut</i>

25:01.345 --> 25:03.478
<i>took the threat
of climate change seriously,</i>

25:03.513 --> 25:07.147
<i>and they might be taking their
cues from Russian state media.</i>

25:18.594 --> 25:22.028
Toboni: <i> While the Russian media tries
to sow doubt about climate change,</i>

25:22.064 --> 25:25.832
<i>the first signs of its long-term
impact are already plain to see.</i>

25:47.621 --> 25:50.321
Toboni: <i>At Lake Baikal, a
jewel of Russian tourism,</i>

25:50.357 --> 25:53.759
<i>forest fires last year were
some of the worst in history</i>

25:53.794 --> 25:56.861
<i>and were covered extensively
by the international press.</i>

25:56.896 --> 25:58.729
Newswoman: <i>Fifty-one
individual fires have spread</i>

25:58.765 --> 26:00.631
<i>across tens of thousands
of acres of land.</i>

26:00.666 --> 26:02.733
Newsman: <i>Particularly
hard hit were the forests</i>

26:02.769 --> 26:05.770
around the world's largest
and deepest freshwater lake.

26:05.805 --> 26:07.671
Toboni: <i>NASA's satellite
imagery showed</i>

26:07.707 --> 26:09.540
<i>more than eight million
acres of forest</i>

26:09.575 --> 26:11.809
<i>were destroyed in early 2016,</i>

26:11.844 --> 26:13.676
<i>but the Russian government
tried to downplay it,</i>

26:13.712 --> 26:17.079
<i>reporting just a fraction
of the damage.</i>

26:18.750 --> 26:20.517
<i>It seemed like
everyone in Russia wanted</i>

26:20.552 --> 26:22.318
<i>to focus on the benefits
of climate change</i>

26:22.353 --> 26:23.920
<i>while ignoring the costs.</i>

26:23.955 --> 26:26.222
<i>And the national narrative
is being orchestrated</i>

26:26.257 --> 26:29.659
<i>from just one place,
the Kremlin.</i>

26:31.529 --> 26:33.361
<i>To get the government's
official stance,</i>

26:33.397 --> 26:34.463
<i>we spoke to President Putin's</i>

26:34.498 --> 26:38.867
<i>top climate change advisor,
Alexander Bedritsky.</i>

26:38.903 --> 26:42.504
Russia's pledge in Paris
actually allows the country

26:42.540 --> 26:46.909
to increase emissions for years to come.
Why is that?

27:37.658 --> 27:40.892
Toboni: <i> Until recently, many
Americans would've considered this</i>

27:40.927 --> 27:43.260
<i>an outdated philosophy
that only made sense</i>

27:43.296 --> 27:44.696
<i>during
the industrial revolution.</i>

27:44.731 --> 27:49.066
<i>But now, it's once again becoming
doctrine in the US as well.</i>

27:49.102 --> 27:50.401
Regarding climate change,

27:50.436 --> 27:52.169
I think the president was
fairly straightforward.

27:52.205 --> 27:53.872
We're not spending money
on that anymore.

27:53.907 --> 27:55.739
We consider that to be
a waste of your money.

27:55.774 --> 27:59.342
A show of hands,
those of you who kind of hope

27:59.378 --> 28:03.580
Administrator Pruitt will just
sort of make the EPA go away.

28:05.851 --> 28:07.283
As of today,

28:07.319 --> 28:09.720
the United States will cease

28:09.755 --> 28:11.755
all implementation

28:11.790 --> 28:14.323
of the nonbinding Paris accord.

28:14.358 --> 28:15.825
What do you think
America's role is

28:15.860 --> 28:17.727
in fighting climate change
compared to Russia?

28:37.113 --> 28:38.914
But with all
these economic opportunities,

28:38.949 --> 28:40.815
it's hard to deny
that climate change

28:40.851 --> 28:43.284
will be financially
beneficial for Russia.
