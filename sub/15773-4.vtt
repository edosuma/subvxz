Why am I stuck doing this?

00:18.380 --> 00:19.610
Don't you remember?

00:19.611 --> 00:21.310
We agreed that you'd do
the chores

00:21.311 --> 00:23.609
for the first
365 days of the year,

00:23.610 --> 00:26.219
then I'll do them
for the rest of the year.

00:26.220 --> 00:28.280
Oh, right.

00:28.290 --> 00:30.289
[Chuckles] Sucker.

00:30.290 --> 00:33.089
[Rumbling]

00:33.090 --> 00:34.959
I wonder what he's up to.

00:34.960 --> 00:36.160
What do I always say?

00:36.161 --> 00:38.659
Don't get involved
in your neighbor's business.

00:38.660 --> 00:41.199
Before you know it,
their business is your business.

00:41.200 --> 00:43.099
It's a very slippery slope.

00:43.100 --> 00:45.099
Daffy, when you live
in a neighborhood,

00:45.100 --> 00:47.070
you live by a strict code
of conduct.

00:47.071 --> 00:48.900
Part of it is being friendly
to your neighbors--

00:48.910 --> 00:52.370
even the bad ones.

00:52.380 --> 00:55.140
Ah, what's up, neighbor?

00:55.150 --> 00:57.649
None of your business,
you bucktoothed varmint!

00:57.650 --> 00:58.779
[Laughs]

00:58.780 --> 01:01.249
What are you laughing at,
beak face?

01:01.250 --> 01:03.220
We're just trying
to be friendly.

01:03.221 --> 01:06.319
I don't need friendship.
I don't need nothin'.

01:06.320 --> 01:08.489
I'm totally self-sufficient.

01:08.490 --> 01:10.789
Or at least I'm about to be,

01:10.790 --> 01:12.999
with these here solar panels.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.329
Good-bye, high energy bills.

01:15.330 --> 01:17.930
Hello, self-sufficiency.

01:19.740 --> 01:23.040
Whoops.
I wanted to keep that.

01:24.810 --> 01:26.880
Wish I had labeled these things.

01:34.420 --> 01:37.450
Jackpot! I'm off the grid.

02:54.430 --> 02:58.069
I know I said I never needed
nothing from nobody,

02:58.070 --> 03:01.639
but could I possibly use
your microwave

03:01.640 --> 03:03.110
to heat my frozen dinner?

03:03.111 --> 03:05.039
Don't get involved!

03:05.040 --> 03:07.839
He's standing right there!

03:07.840 --> 03:10.379

you said something.

Oh, thank goodness.

03:38.910 --> 03:40.679
I mean, it's ready.

03:40.680 --> 03:43.679
Okey dokey.
Well, thanks, neighbors.

03:43.680 --> 03:45.710
Let's never do this again.

And with the extra point,
we'll have a tied ball game.

03:54.930 --> 03:56.690
Of course, in this rain,
the extra point is not--

03:56.691 --> 03:58.759
Sorry.

03:58.760 --> 04:00.700
Code of conduct.

04:03.430 --> 04:07.439
Apparently no power means
no hot water.

04:07.440 --> 04:09.809
Do you mind if I grab
a quick shower?

04:09.810 --> 04:11.740
I'll just be in and out.

04:13.140 --> 04:15.609
Sorry I took so long.

04:15.610 --> 04:18.510
Wound up taking a long bath
after the quick shower.

04:18.519 --> 04:20.319

you lose power.

05:15.270 --> 05:18.409
one of you's got to wake me up
at 4:30 in the morning.

05:18.410 --> 05:20.139
Now, when you're waking me,

05:20.140 --> 05:22.379
you gotta do it
very gentle-like.

Oh, and if there's

thinking that, too?

my fall, roomie!

07:02.500 --> 07:05.439
No. Thank you
for breaking my back.

07:05.440 --> 07:09.639
Eh, this living arrangement
is only temporary, right?

07:09.640 --> 07:10.879
Absolutely!

07:10.880 --> 07:14.379

I'm-a gone!

07:14.380 --> 07:15.779
Well, in the meantime,

07:15.780 --> 07:18.119
I should probably
stock up on some groceries.

07:18.120 --> 07:20.849
I feel like I'm starting
to get hungry.

07:20.850 --> 07:22.789
And believe me,

07:22.790 --> 07:26.389
you won't like me
when I'm hungry.

for spotting me.

07:40.110 --> 07:42.070

living arrangement

07:42.080 --> 07:44.539
is starting to feel
very permanent.

It's got to stop raining
some time.

08:09.740 --> 08:12.339
[Burps] Well, time for bed.

08:12.340 --> 08:14.709
Ahem, ahem.

08:14.710 --> 08:17.079
And, uh, you're sitting on it.

08:17.080 --> 08:18.680
I didn't want it
to come to this,

08:18.681 --> 08:22.349
but I think it would be best
if you slept somewhere else.

08:22.350 --> 08:25.219
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

08:25.220 --> 08:26.689
I'm afraid so.

08:26.690 --> 08:28.750
You can't sleep here.

08:28.760 --> 08:31.159
Well, then it's settled.

08:31.160 --> 08:33.489
You sleep on the couch

08:33.490 --> 08:35.259

in his bed!

to sleep like I'm in a sandwich.

You know, one mattress on the top,
one mattress on the bottom.

08:47.410 --> 08:50.009

08:50.010 --> 08:52.440

08:52.450 --> 08:56.080
Nighty-night. Don't let
the bedbugs bite.

Seriously.

09:00.450 --> 09:02.019

your picture, either.

get on my hands?

09:52.870 --> 09:56.309
Now get! Get, you soft
and pretty gloves.

09:56.310 --> 09:59.679
Uh, what's up, roomies?

09:59.680 --> 10:01.309
Sam, we need to talk.

10:01.310 --> 10:04.519
There's simply not enough room in
this house for the four of us.

10:04.520 --> 10:06.389
I couldn't agree more.

10:06.390 --> 10:09.519
That's why I sent Svetlana
packing this morning.

10:09.520 --> 10:13.689

she just had kind of girls.

10:17.260 --> 10:19.629
Although, now that
I think about it,

10:19.630 --> 10:22.569
I had a crazy dream last night.

10:22.570 --> 10:24.569
I was in the house
I grew up in,

10:24.570 --> 10:26.439
but it was different, you know?

10:26.440 --> 10:30.439
All the rooms were like
on the wrong side.

10:30.440 --> 10:32.409
It was weird. Anyway,

10:32.410 --> 10:34.509
neighbor's dog was there,

10:34.510 --> 10:38.120
but we was all acting
like it was our dog.

10:39.650 --> 10:42.119
Silky.

10:42.120 --> 10:45.820
Does the term
"slippery slope" ring a bell?

10:45.830 --> 10:47.459
You were right.

10:47.460 --> 10:50.329
When I first moved in here,
I remember saying very clearly,

10:50.330 --> 10:52.999
let's not be nice
to the neighbor.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.399
You were right.

10:54.400 --> 10:56.670
And I remember thinking
to myself as I was saying it,

10:56.671 --> 10:58.869
Daffy, this is sounding
a little harsh.

10:58.870 --> 11:00.269
But you know what?

11:00.270 --> 11:02.070
You were right.

11:02.080 --> 11:04.879
I was right!
What'd you say?

11:04.880 --> 11:07.279
- You were right.
