WEBVTT

00:07.257 --> 00:09.301
[sighs]

00:13.012 --> 00:15.390
Morning. Sheila,
what chapter are we on?

00:15.390 --> 00:17.935
-Chapter two, sir.
-What's chapter two about?

00:17.935 --> 00:21.355
-Demography, sir.
-All right, Lori, can you
come write "demography"

00:21.355 --> 00:24.107
on the board for me please?

00:24.107 --> 00:25.776
Sir, are you collecting
our assignments?

00:25.776 --> 00:28.487
Oh yeah, pass your assignments
to the first person.

00:28.487 --> 00:30.614
Jonathan, can you collect
those for me?

00:30.614 --> 00:35.076
Keegan, take the attendance
down. Lori, is anybody away?

00:35.076 --> 00:37.830
-[Lori] No, sir.
-Nobody's away. Tell them
everybody's here.

00:37.830 --> 00:40.165
-Yes, sir.
-Sir, are you handing our
tests back?

00:40.165 --> 00:43.669
Yes. Lori, hand back the tests.
The tests were very well done.

00:43.669 --> 00:45.629
Good work everybody.

00:45.629 --> 00:48.131
-Sir?
-What?

00:48.131 --> 00:50.759
-These aren't marked.
-Hand them out,
we'll mark them now.

00:50.759 --> 00:54.596
Once you get your test pass
it to the person behind you

00:54.596 --> 00:57.140
Last person bring it to the
first person in each row.

00:57.140 --> 01:00.811
Sheila's probably got perfect.
Sheila, we're going to use your
test as the answer key.

01:00.811 --> 01:02.730
So, dictate the answers
from your seat.

01:02.730 --> 01:04.398
Once you've totalled
everything up,

01:04.398 --> 01:06.567
circle the mark in a red pen
in the top right corner

01:06.567 --> 01:08.652
and give them some comments,
like, "Good job,"

01:08.652 --> 01:10.111
"Nice work," "Try harder."

01:10.111 --> 01:12.447
What are you doing?
What happened?

01:16.284 --> 01:20.455
Thanks.
Cramps. Tequila.

01:20.455 --> 01:23.792
Whoever marks her test give
her bonus marks please.

01:23.792 --> 01:27.755
Two extra marks for thinking
of the teacher. Quiet!

01:27.755 --> 01:31.717
[mumbling] Too many shots,
too many shots.

01:31.717 --> 01:33.802
Every time I have shots
I feel like this.

01:36.179 --> 01:38.724
♪ I'm awesome
No you're not dude, don't lie ♪

01:38.724 --> 01:41.476
♪ I'm awesome
I'm driving around
in my mom's ride ♪

01:41.476 --> 01:44.521
♪ I'm awesome
A quarter of my life gone by ♪

01:46.398 --> 01:49.359
♪ I'm awesome ♪

01:56.951 --> 01:59.411
Bill, come here.

01:59.411 --> 02:02.456
Isn't that Daniel Negreanu
right there?

02:02.456 --> 02:04.458
The poker player,
Daniel Negreanu?

02:04.458 --> 02:06.167
Yeah, the poker player. How many
Daniel Negreanus do you know?

02:06.167 --> 02:09.421
He's world famous.
It is, I knew it.

02:09.421 --> 02:11.924
I'm sitting here going,
"Why do I recognize that guy?"

02:11.924 --> 02:13.842
-[Bill] I didn't even notice.
-[Gerry] It's so cool.

02:13.842 --> 02:16.261
He's sitting right there.
Daniel Negreanu.

02:16.261 --> 02:18.097
-[Bill] It's awesome.
-I'm going to go talk to him.

02:18.097 --> 02:21.683
-Daniel Negreanu?
-Hey, what's going on man?

02:21.683 --> 02:23.644
-Is everything okay?
-Oh yeah, you know.

02:23.644 --> 02:26.981
Just been on a little bit
of a bad run. But happens
to the best of us.

02:26.981 --> 02:29.357
Really? You've been
on a bad run? Playing poker?

02:29.357 --> 02:32.319
Yeah, it's just been some
really, really bad luck.

02:32.319 --> 02:35.030
Good news is, it can't
get much worse than this.

02:35.030 --> 02:38.241
Mmm, I was wondering umm...

02:38.241 --> 02:41.369
You wouldn't happen to know
of any cheap hotels around
here would you?

02:41.369 --> 02:44.665
-Like, maybe, free ones?
-Umm, yeah, actually.

02:44.665 --> 02:47.751
Bill, get over here. Come here.
It's my roommate, Bill.

02:47.751 --> 02:52.506
-[Daniel] What's going on Bill?
-We have a cheap hotel, called
our place. Yeah, it's free.

02:52.506 --> 02:54.424
-[Bill] Yes! Yeah we do.
-I'm not going to put you out.

02:54.424 --> 02:58.095
No, you're not putting us out.
When Daniel Negreanu's in
trouble...

02:58.095 --> 03:01.598
Or if Daniel Negreanu's having
a bad streak, where does Daniel
Negreanu stay?

03:01.598 --> 03:04.018
-Daniel Negreanu Motel.
-That's what we're
calling our place.

03:04.018 --> 03:07.228
-Daniel Negreanu Motel.
-By the way, just "Daniel"
is fine.

03:07.228 --> 03:09.272
[Bill and Gerry]
As in Daniel Negreanu!

03:09.272 --> 03:12.693
No one says just Daniel when
talking about Daniel Negreanu.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.778
It's, like,
the whole word is used.

03:14.778 --> 03:17.656
-It's so fun, that you're here.
-He's staying at our place.

03:17.656 --> 03:20.117
-Sleep over!
-[Bill] Yeah!

03:22.452 --> 03:24.371
Excuse me? I'm Darius Lyons.

03:24.371 --> 03:27.749
Oh yes. You're gonna be
covering for Mrs. Donaldson,

03:27.749 --> 03:32.171
who's away on mat leave.
Again. The woman is a machine.

03:32.171 --> 03:36.717
Anyway, her schedule is in
there. Also there's a map
of the school.

03:36.717 --> 03:39.845
If you need anything at all,
my name is Trudy.

03:40.679 --> 03:43.640
-There you are!
-Robert.

03:43.640 --> 03:46.101
Get over here. Ahhh.

03:46.101 --> 03:49.229
Mmmm, ahhh.

03:49.229 --> 03:54.151
Trudy, this is the man
who's responsible for
my love of teaching.

03:54.151 --> 03:58.864
Ohhh, so it was you!
Okay then.

03:58.864 --> 04:01.491
Well, he certainly went out
on a limb to get you here, sir.

04:01.491 --> 04:03.994
Well, it's nice to get some
work, I guess.

04:03.994 --> 04:06.705
Stop embarrassing me.
I'm just happy you're here.

04:06.705 --> 04:10.209
Mrs. Donaldson better watch her
back that you don't replace her
full time, huh?

04:10.209 --> 04:13.128
Good luck today, get to class,
I'll come track you down we'll
get some lunch. How's that?

04:13.128 --> 04:15.255
-Sounds nice.
-Okay, Darius.

04:15.255 --> 04:21.178
Ahhh, 20 years he's been my
mentor, amazing teacher.

04:21.178 --> 04:24.014
Yeah, well he better be, 'cause
he's here for three months.

04:24.014 --> 04:26.558
Oh, he's good. Trust me.

04:26.558 --> 04:29.728
In fact, guys like Darius
shouldn't be subbing. We need
to get him on here full time.

04:29.728 --> 04:31.897
Well, why don't you see if
he has his VP courses?

04:31.897 --> 04:34.942
-Then he could have your job.
-[sarcastic laughs]

04:34.942 --> 04:39.571
Or, maybe I should see if he
can wear circus attire and
have his PhMean.

04:39.571 --> 04:41.990
'Cause then he could do what
you do here, every day.

04:41.990 --> 04:46.203
You know what cowboy?
You don't have a big enough
gun for this showdown.

04:46.203 --> 04:49.706
So, why don't you just back on
out of the saloon? Okay?

04:49.706 --> 04:52.459
[makes squeaky door noises]

04:52.459 --> 04:54.669
[blowing]

04:54.669 --> 04:56.838
-Oh, there you are.
-[Daniel] Hey.

04:56.838 --> 04:59.091
I thought you left without
saying goodbye.

04:59.091 --> 05:01.051
Oh, and you have one of
my shirts on there.

05:01.051 --> 05:03.011
Yeah, sorry. I hope you
don't mind, I was in
those clothes for days.

05:03.011 --> 05:05.847
That's okay. Well, what's the
big city you're off to next?

05:05.847 --> 05:08.058
Nothing really planned,
just going to chill for a bit.

05:08.058 --> 05:11.186
Bill gets up around noon.
I'm sure he'll take you where
you need to go, so...

05:11.186 --> 05:14.522
Cool. Um, hey, I was wondering
do you have an online poker
account?

05:14.522 --> 05:17.192
-Yeah, why?
-I was thinking,
if you wanted to...

05:17.192 --> 05:21.696
That you could transfer me some
money on there and we could go
50/50, I'll run it up.

05:21.696 --> 05:24.032
-I like that idea.
-Yeah?

05:24.032 --> 05:26.743
Yeah. I got about 400 bucks in
there, I'll transfer that over.

05:26.743 --> 05:29.871
400 bucks? I'll run that up
into 10,000 before you get
back from work.

05:29.871 --> 05:32.207
That's five thousand dollars
each! I love it.

05:32.207 --> 05:34.293
Maybe I'll call in sick, I won't
even go to work we'll just hang.

05:34.293 --> 05:37.712
-No, you should
probably go to work.
-I should go to work.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.679
-Gerry!
-Paul.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.848
-What are you doing?
-What does it look like
I'm doing?

05:47.848 --> 05:50.225
-I'm doing my lesson plans.
-It looks like you're doodling.

05:50.225 --> 05:53.937
Anyway, just a reminder, I'll be
using your room during your
spare for the next few days.

05:53.937 --> 05:56.106
They're renovating
the music room.

05:56.106 --> 05:58.192
-I never heard this.
-It was a memo Callaghan
put out.

05:58.192 --> 06:01.736
Yeah, I never got a memo.
So unfortunately, we're not
gonna be able to do that.

06:01.736 --> 06:04.405
'Cause I need to use my room on
my spare the next few days so...

06:04.405 --> 06:07.117
-Sorry.
-[Dwyer] Wait a minute.

06:07.117 --> 06:09.161
-What are you doing?
-There it is.

06:09.161 --> 06:13.414
You were doing your lesson
plan on it. Ha! Thanks Gerry.

06:13.414 --> 06:15.416
Don't steal my quotes.

06:17.376 --> 06:20.421
Guess who stayed at my
house last night!

06:20.421 --> 06:23.050
I'll give you a hint,
it is a world famous person.

06:23.050 --> 06:25.302
-Queen Elizabeth.
-Queen Elizabeth?

06:25.302 --> 06:28.305
Seriously? You think Queen
Elizabeth stayed at my house?

06:28.305 --> 06:30.015
Do you think before you talk?

06:30.015 --> 06:33.060
First of all,
I think she's dead.

06:33.060 --> 06:35.436
I'll give you another hint,
it was a man.

06:35.436 --> 06:37.564
-Justin Bieber.
-[Gerry] Oh, my God.

06:37.564 --> 06:40.734
Yup, that's who it was, Justin
Bieber stayed at my house.

06:40.734 --> 06:44.154
Daniel Negreanu stayed
at my house last night.

06:44.154 --> 06:46.405
-Who is that, sir?
-Is that the guy
with the fishing show?

06:46.405 --> 06:50.160
-No, he is a world
famous poker player.
-I love poker.

06:50.160 --> 06:53.330
Jonathan, I'm pretty sure you
don't love poker if you don't
know who Daniel Negreanu is.

06:53.330 --> 06:55.749
Sir, what does this
have to do with history?

06:55.749 --> 07:00.295
Why do you come in here every
day and just... do that?

07:00.295 --> 07:03.882
I'm just doing my job,
trying to come in,
have a little conversation.

07:03.882 --> 07:08.469
And you go right
for the throat, every day.

07:08.469 --> 07:10.347
Killing me,
you're killing me, Sheila.

07:10.347 --> 07:11.806
I'm here to learn, sir.

07:11.806 --> 07:13.808
I pay a lot of money
to go to this school.

07:13.808 --> 07:16.311
You don't pay anything.
Your parents do.

07:16.311 --> 07:19.856
And Sheila, you will thank me
for teaching how to play poker.

07:19.856 --> 07:22.150
Because when you go
to university, I promise you,

07:22.150 --> 07:25.528
you will play poker for money,
or beer or something.

07:25.528 --> 07:27.030
And you're gonna thank me.

07:27.030 --> 07:29.241
Now, if you don't want to play,

07:29.241 --> 07:31.618
you can work quietly
at your desk.

07:31.618 --> 07:35.038
And be called a loser,
for the rest of your life.

07:35.038 --> 07:38.666
-Oh, no, I'm going to play.
-Okay, good.

07:38.666 --> 07:41.169
You will lose.

07:41.169 --> 07:43.755
Okay class, now like I was
saying, I'm Mr. Lyons.

07:43.755 --> 07:48.843
And I'll be filling in
for Mrs. Donaldson for
the next few months or so.

07:48.843 --> 07:51.430
So, I guess we could start
with attendance.

07:51.430 --> 07:55.934
And see who's here, or more
importantly, who's not here.

07:55.934 --> 08:00.981
She left a chart here
that shows where everyone sits.

08:00.981 --> 08:05.402
-So, Stephan is away today.
-I'm Stephan.

08:05.402 --> 08:07.612
Maybe you have
the sheet upside down.

08:07.612 --> 08:09.948
Oh, look at that.

08:09.948 --> 08:12.533
It has front of the class
written right across the top.

08:12.533 --> 08:15.495
-How handy is this little thing?
-Afternoon, pupils.

08:15.495 --> 08:18.039
Mind if I sit in? Watch my
old mentor in action.

08:18.039 --> 08:20.917
-[Darius] Not at all.
-Won't even know I'm here.

08:23.462 --> 08:27.382
-Still working on attendance.
-Still? Great.

08:28.591 --> 08:30.593
What are you doing?

08:30.593 --> 08:32.679
I was just asking
for an extra pen.

08:32.679 --> 08:35.265
While I'm busting my
butt up here?

08:35.265 --> 08:39.144
Can we just try
to pay attention?

08:39.978 --> 08:42.647
Okay, so, uh... Hey!

08:42.647 --> 08:46.401
What do you
think you're doing...
uh, Jordan?

08:46.401 --> 08:49.863
That's Jordan, I'm Kevin.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.781
Yes, what do you think
you're doing?

08:51.781 --> 08:53.533
I just opened my book up.

08:53.533 --> 08:58.788
Oh, give me a break!
Give me a GD break!

09:06.087 --> 09:08.006
Jonathan, just give me
a few chips, let me back in.

09:08.006 --> 09:10.758
No way! But you're right,
this is fun.

09:10.758 --> 09:12.886
Sheila, you have way too many.
Let me...you have so....

09:12.886 --> 09:15.680
Sir! My dad taught me
two things about poker.

09:15.680 --> 09:20.060
Never lend chips, and take out
the low stack players first.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.769
That's what I did.

09:21.769 --> 09:25.399
-[knocking]
-Oh, my gosh!

09:25.399 --> 09:28.318
-Daniel Negreanu!
-How you doing, kids?

09:28.318 --> 09:30.987
My buddy! What are you doing
here man? What's up?

09:30.987 --> 09:32.989
Actually, I came by to, um,
borrow your credit card.

09:32.989 --> 09:35.033
I need to put some more money
on my online account.

09:35.033 --> 09:37.618
-What have you lost already?
-Just a few hundred.

09:37.618 --> 09:39.120
You know, I'll get it back.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.664
What happened to the thousands
you were gonna...

09:41.664 --> 09:45.460
Relax man, it takes time.
Time and money.

09:45.460 --> 09:47.879
You know, I'm gonna get you up
to ten thousand in no time.

09:47.879 --> 09:50.340
-Ten thousand dollars, huh?
-Mmm-hmm.

09:50.340 --> 09:53.134
-Are you sure you can do that?
-Come on.

09:53.134 --> 09:55.303
-You're Daniel Negreanu. Okay.
-That's right.

09:55.303 --> 09:57.347
-Credit card?
-Yeah. Okay.

09:57.347 --> 09:59.558
Anybody want autographs,
picture?

09:59.558 --> 10:01.642
Pictures, autographs right
now for free. Anyone?

10:01.642 --> 10:04.521
Daniel? Or Daniel and myself?
Anyone?

10:04.521 --> 10:06.814
-[Daniel] Nobody?
-[Gerry] Nothing, they're not
big poker followers.

10:06.814 --> 10:08.275
-Right.
-I'd love a picture later.

10:08.275 --> 10:11.278
-All right, just be careful.
-Yup.

10:11.278 --> 10:14.197
See ya, buddy.

10:19.744 --> 10:23.540
-He's eating all my food.
-Now you know how I feel,
living with you.

10:23.540 --> 10:25.584
It's not funny man,
we gotta get rid of him.

10:25.584 --> 10:27.419
You said this
would be one night.

10:27.419 --> 10:29.546
I can't throw Daniel Negreanu
out on the street.

10:29.546 --> 10:31.506
He's one of the best poker
players in the world.

10:31.506 --> 10:34.050
-[Bill] We have to do something.
-All right, all right,
all right!

10:34.050 --> 10:36.553
Here's what I'm going to do.
I'm going to set up a poker
game with my staff.

10:36.553 --> 10:38.472
I'll bring Daniel,
they don't know who he is.

10:38.472 --> 10:41.015
He'll clean up, he'll make some
money, he'll be gone.

10:41.015 --> 10:43.477
All he's been doing is losing
money, how's that gonna work?

10:43.477 --> 10:45.645
He's not going to lose
to my staff.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.147
I'll get the teachers that have
no idea how to play poker.

10:47.147 --> 10:50.233
-Trust me! It will work.
-All right, okay. Set it up.

10:50.233 --> 10:52.986
-You don't feel bad doing that?
-Why would I feel bad
doing that? Okay.

10:52.986 --> 10:55.655
Normally it would cost people
thousands of dollars to play
poker with Daniel.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.491
Now they get to play
for a couple hundred bucks.

10:57.491 --> 10:59.493
We'll have beers,
it will be fun.

10:59.493 --> 11:01.453
-All right, we get a cut
of the winnings, right?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:01.453 --> 11:03.580
It'll make up for all the stuff
he stole from us.

11:03.580 --> 11:06.124
He sleeps a lot.
Worse roommate than you.

11:06.124 --> 11:08.876
I didn't think that
was possible.

11:10.545 --> 11:12.964
[groaning]

11:13.923 --> 11:15.425
[Robert sighing]

11:16.884 --> 11:19.012
Ahhh.

11:19.012 --> 11:21.764
-Is everything
all right, Robert?
-I don't know.

11:21.764 --> 11:23.933
Do substitutes typically take
a few days to settle in?

11:23.933 --> 11:26.353
-Not usually, why?
-I just don't know if Darius

11:26.353 --> 11:28.563
is the same teacher
he was 20 years ago.

11:28.563 --> 11:32.526
Sure he is. A guy who's been
subbing as long as Darius

11:32.526 --> 11:34.194
has something wrong with him.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.237
But that's not how
I remember it.

11:36.237 --> 11:39.616
It was 20 years ago Robert.
Maybe you've changed.

11:39.616 --> 11:41.326
Did you ever think of that?

11:41.326 --> 11:44.454
Is it possible Darius
was never good?

11:44.454 --> 11:47.748
Yes, it's possible.
It's even probab... yes.

11:47.748 --> 11:52.379
-Sorry, what room am I in again?
-Two-two-three.

11:52.379 --> 11:57.551
If you say so, where's that?
Oh, never mind, I have the map.

11:59.386 --> 12:02.389
Same place as yesterday.

12:02.389 --> 12:03.890
I have to kill my mentor.

12:03.890 --> 12:06.351
No, you don't
have to kill him,

12:06.351 --> 12:08.144
but you do have to fire him.

12:08.144 --> 12:11.231
Which is still pretty awful.

12:12.566 --> 12:15.276
Poor you.
[inhales]

12:17.904 --> 12:21.282
-[cymbal clanging]
-Oh, my God.

12:21.282 --> 12:24.160
This is ridiculous
that he just leaves everything.

12:24.160 --> 12:28.623
Who does that?
How disrespectful is that?

12:28.623 --> 12:30.875
Teacher comes in,
borrows my class.

12:30.875 --> 12:33.587
Just leaves everything strewn
all over the floor like this.

12:33.587 --> 12:35.630
I gotta wander around.

12:35.630 --> 12:39.718
PLO... please leave on.

12:39.718 --> 12:41.511
How am I supposed to use
the board for my lesson?

12:41.511 --> 12:44.472
No, that's not happening.
No, I will not leave that on.

12:44.472 --> 12:46.725
Because I have my own stuff
that I need the board for.

12:46.725 --> 12:49.810
I can't wander,
I normally wander.

12:49.810 --> 12:51.688
It's affecting
my teaching style.

12:51.688 --> 12:54.482
Sir, how does it
affect your teaching?

12:54.482 --> 12:57.151
You usually just sit at your
desk, and we watch movies.

12:57.151 --> 13:00.488
-They're educational films.
-Remember the Titans?

13:01.030 --> 13:03.074
Okay.

13:04.783 --> 13:07.537
This, kids, is disrespectful.

13:07.537 --> 13:10.081
Teachers shouldn't
do this to one another.

13:10.081 --> 13:12.875
Okay? It's not all about music.

13:12.875 --> 13:18.131
This is a social sciences room,
and this is for social sciences.

13:18.131 --> 13:22.176
So, I'm sorry Mr. Dwyer,
but you will just have
to write that again.

13:22.176 --> 13:28.349
Test tomorrow.
Okay, don't forget. All right.

13:28.349 --> 13:32.353
Oh, two can play at that game.
Oh, okay.

13:32.353 --> 13:35.523
Oh yeah, there we go Mr. Dwyer.

13:41.571 --> 13:46.951
[Gerry] Hey Wayne. The Wayner,
the Wayne Gretzky of librarians.

13:46.951 --> 13:48.911
That's what I call you.

13:48.911 --> 13:50.789
Look, I know we don't always
see eye to eye.

13:50.789 --> 13:52.957
But I though we'd
patch that up with a little

13:52.957 --> 13:56.461
staff poker night
I'm having at Barrels.

13:56.461 --> 13:59.380
-I'd like you to be there Wayne.
-I only play Pai-Gow.

13:59.380 --> 14:01.382
All right, well maybe you
could try poker.

14:01.382 --> 14:04.761
We could, get caught up.
We don't even talk.

14:04.761 --> 14:07.888
Okay, I will learn it today
on my spare.

14:07.888 --> 14:11.100
On your spare? Isn't your
whole day a spare?

14:11.100 --> 14:15.146
I'm sorry, librarians are an
essential part of the school
system. So, thank you.

14:15.146 --> 14:17.482
-[Leung] Thank you.
-Lisa! Poker tonight

14:17.482 --> 14:19.734
with the staff, at Barrels,
are you in?

14:19.734 --> 14:22.069
Oh, I would love to,
but I have a test

14:22.069 --> 14:24.322
that I have to prepare for
at the end of the month, so.

14:24.322 --> 14:26.491
Okay, well Bill's
gonna be there!

14:26.491 --> 14:29.494
Bill? Why would that matter
if Bill was there?

14:29.494 --> 14:31.204
Don't know, but he keeps
asking about you.

14:31.204 --> 14:32.831
Asking about me?

14:34.874 --> 14:37.836
-Anyway, so you coming?
-Yeah, yeah, I'll be there.

14:37.836 --> 14:40.921
Bring lots of money.
Simon! Play poker?

14:40.921 --> 14:42.382
Don't know, never tried.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.300
Okay. Well tonight
I've organized

14:44.300 --> 14:47.053
a friendly staff poker
night at Barrels.

14:47.053 --> 14:48.847
I'd like you to come,
as my friend.

14:48.847 --> 14:51.057
-Okay.
-But you gotta bring real money.

14:51.057 --> 14:53.226
It's real money poker okay?

14:53.226 --> 14:56.103
I will bring
ten thousand dollars.

14:57.480 --> 15:01.275
I don't think anybody
will be bringing ten...

15:01.275 --> 15:04.571
Okay, ten thousand dollars.

15:06.740 --> 15:09.492
All right, that's good.
Okay.

15:17.584 --> 15:19.669
[scoffs]

15:22.213 --> 15:23.673
So how's it been going today?

15:23.673 --> 15:25.592
Who knows?

15:25.592 --> 15:28.177
Darius, do you remember
when we used to sub together?

15:28.177 --> 15:32.139
-Not really.
-Do you ever think
about retiring?

15:32.139 --> 15:33.767
What? From this?
No, I love it.

15:33.767 --> 15:35.769
-You're fired.
-Hmm?

15:35.769 --> 15:40.356
-Mrs. Donaldson's back.
-From mat leave? Already?

15:40.356 --> 15:44.360
Yeah. Preemie. Alex.

15:44.360 --> 15:47.530
-He seems to be doing okay.
-Great!

15:47.530 --> 15:50.283
If you need to talk,
you can just...

15:50.283 --> 15:52.285
No, look it's great, really.

15:52.285 --> 15:54.579
I was hoping to get an early
start on my weekend.

15:54.579 --> 15:58.458
It's me Darius. Just use me
as a shoulder to cry on.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.627
Okay, goodbye.

16:04.046 --> 16:06.006
No.

16:07.675 --> 16:11.011
Sweet, stupid man.

16:12.722 --> 16:14.641
[making robot noises]

16:14.641 --> 16:17.268
So how do you know
Gerry, Daniel?

16:17.268 --> 16:19.395
Oh, you know,
just through a few buddies.

16:19.395 --> 16:22.398
-Yeah, yeah we go way back.
-Are you a teacher as well?

16:22.398 --> 16:25.151
A lot of questions we're not
here for questions okay?

16:25.151 --> 16:26.611
We're here to play some poker.

16:26.611 --> 16:30.364
Chest a minute,
can't start without us.

16:30.364 --> 16:33.534
Hi, everybody, sorry we're late.

16:33.534 --> 16:35.662
Oh, Trudy, this is Daniel,
Gerry's friend.

16:35.662 --> 16:39.290
-How you doing?
-Hello Daniel.

16:39.290 --> 16:42.376
Gerry, can I talk to you
for a second?

16:42.376 --> 16:44.420
I'm getting ready, just sit
down and let's get started.

16:44.420 --> 16:46.589
Gosh, you look awfully
familiar, Daniel.

16:46.589 --> 16:49.550
Now, where would I have
seen you before?

16:49.550 --> 16:52.595
Know what? I'm not being a
good host, let me, uh...

16:52.595 --> 16:54.472
[Trudy] All right.

16:54.472 --> 16:56.933
Daniel Negreanu,
I want in, 20 percent.

16:56.933 --> 17:00.019
-I don't know what you're
talking about.
-Don't even.

17:00.019 --> 17:02.522
You set this whole thing up.
Either you cut me in

17:02.522 --> 17:05.358
or I will squawk
like a chicken.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.527
Fine.

17:10.947 --> 17:15.493
All right, let's go. Uhhh, let's
say five hundred dollar buy in.

17:15.493 --> 17:17.745
-What, are you crazy?
-I don't have money that much.

17:17.745 --> 17:19.622
Gerry, you said this was going
to be a friendly game of poker.

17:19.622 --> 17:22.082
[yells] I'm in!

17:22.082 --> 17:24.752
-Hundred dollar buy in.
-Fifty dollars.

17:24.752 --> 17:28.756
-Yeah, fifty.
-Fifty dollars and we can buy
in as many times as we want.

17:28.756 --> 17:31.509
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:31.509 --> 17:34.094
Buy in as much as you want.
Get lots of money, good.

17:34.094 --> 17:37.181
-I will be buying in once.
-Let's play some poker.

17:40.226 --> 17:43.646
[Gerry] Very distracting Trudy,
put a sweater on or something.

17:43.646 --> 17:45.899
Nice.

17:51.237 --> 17:54.782
All right, here we go.
Heads up poker.

17:54.782 --> 17:57.368
You know, the key to poker is
just knowing how to read people.

17:57.368 --> 17:59.746
-Is that so?
-Black's catching up to red.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.539
You want to know what I'm
reading right now?

18:01.539 --> 18:04.375
Hmm, probably at a fourth
grade level.

18:04.375 --> 18:07.587
-Ohhh.
-Deal the cards Gerry!

18:07.587 --> 18:09.672
Take those off.

18:09.672 --> 18:12.717
You gotta either stop yelling
or you gotta turn the music off.

18:12.717 --> 18:14.176
Mmmm.

18:16.054 --> 18:17.972
[Trudy] Read 'em
and weep Leung.

18:17.972 --> 18:19.640
[Trudy laughs]

18:19.640 --> 18:22.852
[Malik] Ahhh, nice.

18:22.852 --> 18:24.395
[Simon] Oh, everyone's
getting intense.

18:27.147 --> 18:29.275
[Leung yells] I'm all in!

18:29.275 --> 18:31.277
Why do I feel you have tens or
jacks or something like that?

18:31.277 --> 18:32.862
[Malik] Yeah, yeah.
It's a good feeling.

18:32.862 --> 18:34.321
[Daniel]
I have no choice, I call.

18:34.321 --> 18:36.699
-Here we go.
-[Gerry] Okay. Two tens.

18:36.699 --> 18:39.243
-You're right,
this is a big pot.
-What is happening?

18:39.243 --> 18:42.080
[Malik] Come on, come on.
Bring it. Bring the pain.

18:42.080 --> 18:43.915
[yells] Burn a card!

18:43.915 --> 18:45.458
How many times
are you gonna say that?

18:45.458 --> 18:47.085
You've said it for two hours.

18:47.085 --> 18:50.504
And I haven't forgotten once
to burn a card. It's annoying.

18:50.504 --> 18:53.091
You're yelling is annoying.
Pair of kings.

18:53.091 --> 18:55.301
-It's a good flop for me.
-[Gerry] Pair of kings.

18:55.301 --> 18:57.344
-Daniel's ahead.
-[Yells] Burn a card!

18:57.344 --> 18:59.764
Stop telling me to burn a card!
I have not forgotten

18:59.764 --> 19:01.891
in two hours to burn a card!

19:01.891 --> 19:03.684
You've said it every time!

19:04.518 --> 19:07.480
Burn!
Turn!

19:07.480 --> 19:10.149
-[Malik] Daniel Still.
-Give me a ten!

19:10.149 --> 19:13.820
He wants a ten. You know what
the odds are of getting a ten?

19:13.820 --> 19:16.823
-It's like seven percent.
-Like seven percent!

19:16.823 --> 19:18.741
Your night is over!

19:18.741 --> 19:21.911
Boo-ya!
No ten!

19:21.911 --> 19:23.955
-You forgot to burn a card.
-[Trudy] Idiot!

19:23.955 --> 19:25.915
-[Leung] Ha-ha!
-[Gerry whispers] What?

19:27.792 --> 19:31.545
-No!
-[all] Ohhh!

19:31.545 --> 19:34.674
[Simon laughs] This is great.

19:34.674 --> 19:37.426
-What happened?
-It's just bad luck.

19:37.426 --> 19:40.346
-What the hell's wrong with you?
-River had him going in.

19:40.346 --> 19:43.683
I want my money! [laughs]

19:43.683 --> 19:45.977
-This is your fault.
-How do you lose?

19:45.977 --> 19:48.062
-Nice hand.
-[Gerry] Try to keep it.

19:48.062 --> 19:50.940
-You can't, that's not
how it works Gerry.
-Try to keep some.

19:53.901 --> 19:58.114
How do you lose to a guy that
learned to play poker four hours
earlier, on his spare?

19:58.114 --> 20:00.574
Gerry, I beat that guy,
seriously nine out of ten times!

20:00.574 --> 20:03.536
He was awful! Like absolutely
terrible. It was just really
bad luck.

20:03.536 --> 20:07.081
He's not sitting on my couch
right now asking me for money
every day though is he?

20:07.081 --> 20:09.583
Yeah, he left with you your
money, but that's just a
temporary thing.

20:09.583 --> 20:11.418
-I can't hear you
Daniel Negreanu.
-You just don't get it right?

20:11.418 --> 20:14.172
I need a little bit of a bank
roll. So we can build on this.

20:14.172 --> 20:17.133
There's no more money.
There's no more lending
Daniel Negreanu money.

20:17.133 --> 20:20.720
I just, I can't deal with this
anymore. I'm sorry Daniel,
you have to leave.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.680
-Where do you want me to go?
-I don't know, I don't care.

20:22.680 --> 20:23.890
It's not my problem,
but this is ridiculous.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.224
Gerry just have a little faith.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.809
I'm gonna win back
all your money.

20:26.809 --> 20:28.978
Plus we're gonna win like
another ten, 20 thousand.

20:28.978 --> 20:31.522
-No problem.
-No, I'm sorry. Okay.

20:31.522 --> 20:36.276
You can sleep over, in the
morning Daniel Negreanu is gone.

20:36.276 --> 20:38.029
I'm sorry.

20:38.029 --> 20:40.406
It's Negreanu, idiot!

20:45.161 --> 20:46.996
So Lisa was looking pretty
good the other day.

20:46.996 --> 20:49.331
Do me a favor, stay away
from the people I work with.

20:49.331 --> 20:51.250
It's a free country.

20:51.250 --> 20:55.254
-Are you texting her right now?
-Nah, of course not.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.881
-It's Daniel.
-Daniel?

20:56.881 --> 20:58.799
-Negreanu.
-Why are you talking to him?

20:58.799 --> 21:01.343
He just won 3.2 million
in Barcelona.

21:01.343 --> 21:02.762
This guy's on fire right now.

21:02.762 --> 21:05.389
Unbelievable.
Why is he not texting me?

21:05.389 --> 21:08.475
-Because you kicked him out.
-Yeah, but I let him live here.

21:08.475 --> 21:10.436
-So why is he texting you?
-I don't know.

21:10.436 --> 21:12.563
-He got me this watch, too.
-He got you a watch?

21:12.563 --> 21:15.108
-Yeah, look at that.
-What? For what?

21:15.108 --> 21:17.359
I don't know, being cool.

21:17.359 --> 21:18.861
I want a watch.

21:18.861 --> 21:21.781
♪ Awesome, awesome
awesome, awesome ♪
