How could you say you wantto go back to the red team?

01:51.111 --> 01:51.973

at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.

02:08.369 --> 02:12.132
And now the continuation of"Hell's Kitchen All Stars."

02:12.235 --> 02:13.133
Get out of here.

02:17.654 --> 02:19.346
That was fucked up.

02:19.449 --> 02:20.588
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm good.

02:20.692 --> 02:21.658
Hey.

02:21.762 --> 02:22.970
Sometimes you got
to shut the fuck up.

02:23.073 --> 02:24.109
Yeah, I know.

02:24.213 --> 02:25.835
I hope the blue team
doesn't feel betrayed.

02:25.938 --> 02:27.008
I think some of them are hurt.

02:27.112 --> 02:29.287
But Chef Ramsay
asked me a question.

02:29.390 --> 02:30.391
And I supposed to lie?

02:30.495 --> 02:31.703
I'm not going to lie.

02:31.806 --> 02:33.222
Thank you.

02:33.325 --> 02:34.119
What?

02:34.223 --> 02:35.155
Just saying that.
Thank you.

02:35.258 --> 02:36.363
What?

02:36.466 --> 02:37.329
I mean, you don't want tobe on our team, though.

02:37.433 --> 02:38.675
I do want to be
on your team, guys.

02:38.779 --> 02:39.918
Don't-- uh-- don't even startwith that because it's not

02:40.021 --> 02:40.953
even-- it's not even worth it.

02:41.057 --> 02:42.092
I want to be on the--

02:42.196 --> 02:43.715
I just want us tocommunicate and not fight.

02:43.818 --> 02:44.854
That's it.

02:44.957 --> 02:45.613
Yeah, there's no point
in talking about it.

02:45.717 --> 02:47.028
It's not worth my breath.

02:47.132 --> 02:48.513
I think Robyn talks too much.

02:48.616 --> 02:50.653
She is kind of self-sabotaging.

02:50.756 --> 02:52.448
She needs to just
learn when to shut up,

02:52.551 --> 02:54.346
and she really doesn't haveany other choice right now.

02:54.450 --> 02:55.796
You shouldn't
say that out loud.

02:55.899 --> 02:56.866
I'll be honest with you.
- I know.

02:56.969 --> 02:57.936
I should never have said that.

02:58.039 --> 02:59.006
It's all right for
you to think that.

02:59.109 --> 03:01.284
You should never fucking
say that out loud.

03:01.388 --> 03:03.079
But from the moment you werecoming to the blue team,

03:03.183 --> 03:03.942
we took you in.

03:04.045 --> 03:05.185
Open arms.

03:05.288 --> 03:06.634
What I need to do so I'mnot on the chopping block

03:06.738 --> 03:08.636
again is I just need tokeep my mouth shut and speak

03:08.740 --> 03:10.397
when I'm spoken to.

03:10.500 --> 03:14.194
[sigh] Fuck my life.

03:14.297 --> 03:16.541
NARRATOR: With a clear lackof harmony on the blue team,

03:16.644 --> 03:19.302
the chefs must put their
negativity to the side

03:19.406 --> 03:21.822
so that it doesn't affecttheir performance in Chef

03:21.925 --> 03:24.100
Ramsay's next challenge.

03:24.204 --> 03:24.997

04:51.291 --> 04:52.084
Is that clear?

04:52.188 --> 04:53.500
Yes, chef.

07:54.991 --> 07:57.200
I don't like it,
not a little bit.

07:57.304 --> 07:58.167
Dana's leaving.

07:58.270 --> 07:59.617
How's the duck, Gio?

07:59.720 --> 08:01.066
Skin's looking nice
and golden brown.

08:02.067 --> 08:02.861
Salmon's here.

08:02.965 --> 08:03.759
Elise!

08:03.862 --> 08:04.829
In the convection oven.

08:04.932 --> 08:05.795
Put it in the convection oven.

08:09.040 --> 08:10.490
Hey, did you glaze that pork?

08:10.593 --> 08:11.974
There's only four of us left.

08:12.077 --> 08:12.975
Let me get the potatoes.

08:13.078 --> 08:14.701
I'm working on five
different things,

08:14.804 --> 08:17.186
and I have a feeling
Chef Ramsay isn't done.

08:17.289 --> 08:18.290
Listen up!

08:18.394 --> 08:20.638
Time to kick out one more chef.

08:20.741 --> 08:22.122
I'm going to go, but look.Come here.

08:22.225 --> 08:23.019

NARRATOR: The chefs
in each kitchen

08:32.546 --> 08:36.239
are dropping like flies asevery three minutes Chef Ramsay

08:36.343 --> 08:38.069
calls for another one to go.

08:38.172 --> 08:39.691
How long on the Wellington?

08:39.795 --> 08:40.727
Six minutes.

08:40.830 --> 08:41.624
Listen up!

08:41.728 --> 08:43.108
Say goodbye to one more chef.

08:43.212 --> 08:44.040
I got 90% of my stuff done.

08:44.144 --> 08:45.179
It's right here.
- Go.

08:45.283 --> 08:46.456
Amanda, go.

08:46.560 --> 08:48.182

08:48.286 --> 08:49.736
You're working on meats?[interposing voices]

08:49.839 --> 08:50.806
I'm working on meats and fish.

Yes, meats and fish.

08:52.117 --> 08:53.809
Check the lamb.

08:53.912 --> 08:54.741
Fuck!

08:54.844 --> 08:55.638
It's me and Michelle.

08:55.742 --> 08:56.881
And this is crazy.

08:56.984 --> 08:58.952
I don't know what thehell's going on right now.

08:59.055 --> 09:00.022
One more minute, lamb.

09:00.125 --> 09:01.092
Wellington coming together.

09:01.195 --> 09:01.989
How's that duck?

09:02.093 --> 09:02.921
Is it done?

09:03.025 --> 09:03.922
VAN: Yeah, the duck's ready.

09:04.026 --> 09:05.096
Red team, blue team!

09:05.199 --> 09:06.028

Say goodbye to one more chef.

09:07.339 --> 09:08.133
Let's go.

09:08.237 --> 09:09.618
Michelle, I'll go.

09:09.721 --> 09:10.688
OK.

09:10.791 --> 09:11.896
There was no discussing it.

09:11.999 --> 09:14.036
Jennifer just basically
said, you know what?

09:14.139 --> 09:15.796
You're the last woman
standing in our kitchen.

09:15.900 --> 09:17.867
So I cannot let my team down.

09:17.971 --> 09:19.006
Pull up lamb, please.

09:19.110 --> 09:20.111
Check the fish.

09:20.214 --> 09:21.768
- You want to go?
- You got it?

09:21.871 --> 09:22.285
Sure.
- All right.

09:22.389 --> 09:23.390
Let's do it.

09:23.493 --> 09:25.047
I'm volunteering to
stay in the kitchen

09:25.150 --> 09:26.462
because this is
my chance to show

09:26.566 --> 09:29.430
Chef Ramsay that I can handlethis giant workload on my own.

09:29.534 --> 09:30.328
I'm a competitor.

09:30.431 --> 09:32.054
Let's go, Nick!

09:32.157 --> 09:33.055
Hey, talk to me.

09:33.158 --> 09:34.159
What else do I need to do?

09:34.263 --> 09:35.126
[interposing voices]

09:35.229 --> 09:36.576
One thing at a time for her.

09:36.679 --> 09:37.577
She's only got two hands.

09:37.680 --> 09:38.923
Fuck.

09:39.026 --> 09:40.718
I'm not sure that Michellecan handle this by herself.

09:40.821 --> 09:42.202
Michelle looks flustered.

09:42.305 --> 09:43.928
Check the lamb!

09:44.031 --> 09:45.205
Salmon, where is it?

09:45.308 --> 09:46.551
Right behind you.

09:46.655 --> 09:49.830
Red team, blue
team, listen up.

09:49.934 --> 09:50.797
All of you get back in there.

09:50.900 --> 09:51.729
Let's go.

09:51.832 --> 09:52.971
Move, move!

09:53.075 --> 09:54.870
NARRATOR: Now with allchefs back in the kitchen--

09:54.973 --> 09:55.802
What do you want me to do?

09:55.905 --> 09:57.286
Guys, I need meat sliced.

09:57.389 --> 09:59.633
NARRATOR: --each team hasonly three minutes to race

09:59.737 --> 10:01.911
to the finish an d

Let's plate that shit up, getit up to the pass, and pray.

- I'm good.

10:09.781 --> 10:11.093
I'm good.

10:11.196 --> 10:13.129
DANA: I'm looking at the porkchop, and I'm really worried.

10:13.233 --> 10:16.270
The pork chop is deceivingbecause it feels like it's

10:16.374 --> 10:17.720
cooked even when it's not.

10:17.824 --> 10:19.101
Give me the sauce.

10:19.204 --> 10:20.136
Oh, my god.

10:20.240 --> 10:21.551
The pork is raw.

10:21.655 --> 10:22.656
Guys, lamb's in the oven.

10:22.760 --> 10:23.761
Needs a one minute.

10:24.762 --> 10:25.555
I need shrimp.

10:25.659 --> 10:27.350
I'm slicing the
duck right now.

10:27.454 --> 10:33.598
GORDON RAMSAY: Five, four,three, two, one, and serve!

10:39.466 --> 10:40.916
Before the challenge,
I told all of you

10:41.019 --> 10:42.883
how important it
was to communicate.

10:42.987 --> 10:44.574
That was the lesson.

10:44.678 --> 10:48.233
No matter what happens,
we remain united.

10:48.337 --> 10:49.752
Red team, blue team, happy?

10:49.856 --> 10:50.960
- No, chef.
- No.

10:51.064 --> 10:51.892
Why not?

10:51.996 --> 10:53.514
We didn't finish our pork.

10:53.618 --> 10:54.792
Where's the pork?

10:54.895 --> 10:57.070
DANA: Right here, chef.

10:57.173 --> 10:58.105
Wow.

10:58.209 --> 10:59.348
Pass it down.

10:59.451 --> 11:00.245
Oh, dear.

11:02.489 --> 11:05.665
DANA: We're serving
Chef Ramsay pork sushi.

11:05.768 --> 11:07.563
Like, that's embarrassing.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.117
Who cooked the
pork on the red team?

11:21.025 --> 11:23.717
NARRATOR: In today's lastchef standing challenge,

11:23.821 --> 11:27.100
each all star team workedtogether to cook six entrees

11:27.203 --> 11:28.480
from the Hell's Kitchen menu.

11:28.584 --> 11:30.344
GORDON RAMSAY: I'll be judgingyour dishes head to head.

11:30.448 --> 11:34.003
The better dish from eachteam will win the rounds.

11:34.107 --> 11:35.867
NARRATOR: But the
red team's raw pork--

11:35.971 --> 11:36.972
Where's the pork?

11:37.075 --> 11:40.423
NARRATOR: --has them
off to a horrific start.

11:40.527 --> 11:43.081
Oh, dear.

11:43.185 --> 11:47.741
Who cooked the pork
on the red team?

11:47.845 --> 11:50.675
DANA: I started it, andthen I passed it on when I

11:50.779 --> 11:51.952
was kicked out of the kitchen.

11:52.056 --> 11:53.402
Wow.

11:53.505 --> 11:56.785
The only thing missing on thispork dish is the fucking tail.

11:56.888 --> 11:57.682
Right.

11:57.786 --> 11:58.752
Pork chop, blue team.

12:01.651 --> 12:03.412
Mm.

12:03.515 --> 12:05.310
Wow.

12:05.414 --> 12:08.106
The winner of this round isdefinitely the blue team.

12:08.210 --> 12:09.038
[ding] Good job.

12:09.142 --> 12:09.970
Thank you, chef.

12:10.074 --> 12:12.283
This raw pork
is not my fault. I

12:12.386 --> 12:13.733
got kicked out of the kitchen.

12:13.836 --> 12:17.150
I'm just hoping that everythingelse is cooked perfectly.

12:17.253 --> 12:18.116
GORDON RAMSAY: Right.

12:18.220 --> 12:19.808
Next up, Beef
Wellington, please.

12:19.911 --> 12:21.257
Pass it down.

12:21.361 --> 12:23.812
Thank you.

12:23.915 --> 12:24.744
Blue team, let's taste.

12:28.644 --> 12:29.749
Delicious.

12:29.852 --> 12:31.992
Could have done with twomore moments in the oven.

12:32.096 --> 12:34.167
Ladies.

12:34.270 --> 12:35.064
Mm.

12:35.168 --> 12:37.342
Well done.

12:37.446 --> 12:38.792
It's tough one, that one.

12:38.896 --> 12:40.483
That was the hardest
protein to cook.

12:40.587 --> 12:42.934
So the point goes to the redteam [ding] and the blue team.

12:43.038 --> 12:43.832
[ding]

12:43.935 --> 12:44.971
- Thank you, chef.
- All right.

12:45.074 --> 12:46.627
Let's go for the halibut,shall we, please?

12:46.731 --> 12:47.870
NARRATOR: With the
blue team still

12:47.974 --> 12:51.080
hanging on to a slim
lead, the red is hoping

12:51.184 --> 12:54.118
their halibut has the edge.

12:54.221 --> 12:57.190
GORDON RAMSAY: The
halibut is delicious.

12:57.293 --> 13:00.193
Blue team.

13:00.296 --> 13:03.506
ROBYN: Please let their
fish be overcooked.

13:03.610 --> 13:06.855
GORDON RAMSAY: The halibutis cooked beautifully.

13:06.958 --> 13:10.548
Point goes to both teams.

13:10.651 --> 13:14.034
[ding] Duck breast, let's go.

13:14.138 --> 13:17.969
Blue team, that's
cooked beautifully.

13:18.073 --> 13:19.902
Delicious.

13:20.006 --> 13:22.146
Pretty good, indeed.

13:22.249 --> 13:23.043
Red team.

13:26.564 --> 13:28.359
Duck delicious on both dishes.

13:31.051 --> 13:33.640
The point goes to the blueteam [ding] and the red team.

13:33.743 --> 13:34.986
[ding]

13:35.090 --> 13:37.195
If Chef RAMSAY want to keepdoing everybody get a point,

13:37.299 --> 13:38.921
both of y'all get
a point, fuck it.

13:39.025 --> 13:41.268
We'll take that, too, becausewe're in the lead right now.

13:41.372 --> 13:43.201
Rack of lamb next.

13:43.305 --> 13:45.445
Who cooked the rack of
lamb on the red team?

13:45.548 --> 13:46.826
- I did, chef.
- Wow.

13:46.929 --> 13:48.413
I'm not going to eat thatbecause you know why.

13:48.517 --> 13:49.483
ROBYN: Yeah, it's not done.

13:49.587 --> 13:50.899
That thing's got
more chance of getting

13:51.002 --> 13:54.592
put back in the field than ithas me fucking swallowing it.

13:54.695 --> 13:58.734
The question is, is the blueteam's lamb good enough?

13:58.838 --> 14:00.701
The score is three
to four in our favor.

14:00.805 --> 14:02.393
And this dish can win it for us.

14:02.496 --> 14:03.290
Who cooked this lamb?

14:03.394 --> 14:04.602
I did, chef.

14:04.705 --> 14:06.500
It's weird because I'vegot bits here that are raw.

14:06.604 --> 14:08.848
And there are bits here
that are well done.

14:08.951 --> 14:10.815
And yet it's from the
same fucking rack.

14:10.919 --> 14:12.575
You bastardized it.

14:12.679 --> 14:14.025
NICK: Chef Ramsay
has every right

14:14.129 --> 14:15.302
to be criticizing this lamb.

14:15.406 --> 14:16.856
It's just a mess.

14:16.959 --> 14:21.584
The point goes
to neither team.

14:21.688 --> 14:23.655
NARRATOR: With the blue
team unable to rack up

14:23.759 --> 14:26.210
the winning point, Chef
Ramsay calls for the--

14:26.313 --> 14:27.142
Salmon, please.

14:27.245 --> 14:28.039
Pass it down.

14:28.143 --> 14:29.420
Thank you.

14:29.523 --> 14:33.044
NARRATOR: And the red team'sonly hope is to end in a tie.

14:33.148 --> 14:36.323
GORDON RAMSAY: Uh, blue team,that looks lovely, crispy skin.

14:41.225 --> 14:43.296

I did, chef.

14:44.331 --> 14:45.815
Who cooked the shrimp?

14:45.919 --> 14:48.335
I did, chef.

14:48.439 --> 14:55.860
GORDON RAMSAY: Salmon's
perfect, but the shrimp,

14:55.964 --> 14:58.449
when they're curled up likethat, what does that mean?

14:58.552 --> 14:59.691
They're overcooked, chef.

14:59.795 --> 15:00.865
GORDON RAMSAY: They
are overcooked.

15:00.969 --> 15:04.213
Uh, the winner of the
challenge clearly--

congratulations blue team.

15:05.697 --> 15:06.491

15:12.946 --> 15:17.019

15:17.123 --> 15:19.056
The red team isspiraling out of control.

15:19.159 --> 15:21.058
Honestly, it's really
no surprise that we

15:21.161 --> 15:23.439
keep winning dinner service.

15:23.543 --> 15:24.854
GORDON RAMSAY: Blue
team, well done.

15:24.958 --> 15:28.410
You're in for a
great, amazing day.

16:03.721 --> 16:06.517
The dining room is longoverdue for a deep cleaning.

16:06.620 --> 16:07.897
And then get Marino's
shirts ready ahead

16:08.001 --> 16:09.244
of the next service.

16:09.347 --> 16:10.590
Do you know how picky he is?

16:10.693 --> 16:12.626
Yeah, he's a pain in the ass.

16:12.730 --> 16:14.697
The kitchens also
need deep cleaning.

16:14.801 --> 16:16.492
You're going to make surethey're absolutely spotless.

16:16.596 --> 16:17.424
Yes, chef.

16:17.528 --> 16:18.978
Now get out of here.

16:19.081 --> 16:20.255
Let's go.

16:20.358 --> 16:21.981
We're going to be
in for a long day.

16:22.084 --> 16:23.672
You're welcome, Marino.

16:23.775 --> 16:26.054
Should I make you
a sandwich, too?

16:26.157 --> 16:27.917
I feel like I'm at
my grandma's house.

16:28.918 --> 16:29.712
Whoo-whoo!

16:29.816 --> 16:32.992
I'm getting a window seat.

16:33.095 --> 16:35.822
Ain't no way in hell
I'm climbing this.

16:35.925 --> 16:37.237
I'd never been
rock climbing, so I

16:37.341 --> 16:41.483
look forward to seeing if myold fat ass can climb a rock.

16:41.586 --> 16:42.794
The Italian stallion.

16:42.898 --> 16:44.141
- Hey!
- All right.

16:44.244 --> 16:45.038
Whoo!

16:45.142 --> 16:46.281
[applause]

16:46.384 --> 16:48.662
All right.

16:48.766 --> 16:49.836
Grandpa's done.

16:49.939 --> 16:51.769
Grandpa is done.

16:51.872 --> 16:52.873
It's tiring.

16:52.977 --> 16:54.220
I'm too old for this.

16:54.323 --> 16:55.083
Let's go, Milly.

16:59.777 --> 17:00.571
Oh!

17:03.091 --> 17:03.988
No.

17:04.092 --> 17:05.162
NICK: He has his
drawers [inaudible]..

17:05.265 --> 17:06.094
Look at him twerking it out.

17:06.197 --> 17:07.095
I'm not ashamed.

17:07.198 --> 17:08.199
You know, I got on
designer drawers.

17:08.303 --> 17:09.890
Why not show them off?

17:09.994 --> 17:10.857
Fuck that.

17:10.960 --> 17:12.859
It's hard, climbing
fucking rocks.

17:12.962 --> 17:14.516
Like this ain't no joke.

17:14.619 --> 17:15.517
So you just do this for fun?

17:15.620 --> 17:16.414
Yeah.

17:16.518 --> 17:17.312
Silly.

17:17.415 --> 17:18.727
[laughter]

17:19.797 --> 17:21.661
Oh, my god.

17:21.764 --> 17:22.903
So I have plenty of shoes.

17:23.007 --> 17:24.112
I just put it out like this.

17:24.215 --> 17:25.354
OK?

17:25.458 --> 17:26.459
Oh!

17:26.562 --> 17:27.529
These ones is not mine.

17:27.632 --> 17:29.324
Yes, they are.

17:29.427 --> 17:31.222
Marino, what do you
do in your spare time?

17:33.742 --> 17:34.570
No, no.

17:34.674 --> 17:36.089
Just the-- just the front tip.

17:36.193 --> 17:36.986
Oh, I don't know.

17:37.090 --> 17:38.816
I'm not a shoe shine expert.

17:38.919 --> 17:40.335
I think my shoe
looks pretty good.

17:40.438 --> 17:42.751
Yeah.

17:42.854 --> 17:44.235
Maybe we should line them up.

17:44.339 --> 17:47.480
They're going to get scuffed.

17:47.583 --> 17:51.208
DANA: Barbie, of course, is theknow-it-all of shoe shining.

17:51.311 --> 17:55.039
So I decide to vacuum becauseI don't have to listen to her.

17:55.143 --> 17:58.007
Shoe maintenance
is really important.

17:58.111 --> 18:00.113
MILLY: [inaudible]
go eat some steaks!

18:00.217 --> 18:01.010
Look at this, guys.

18:01.114 --> 18:01.908
Nice.

18:02.011 --> 18:02.943
Oh, wow.

18:03.047 --> 18:04.324
- Look at that, huh?
- Chef Christina.

18:04.428 --> 18:05.601
Hey!
[interposing voices]

18:05.705 --> 18:08.466
We got the chefs here.

18:08.570 --> 18:10.606
What a great surprise to haveboth of you all here with us.

18:10.710 --> 18:12.298
We're doing lunch
twice as nice today.

18:12.401 --> 18:13.333
- Look at the presentation.- Honestly.

18:13.437 --> 18:14.231
[interposing voices]

18:14.334 --> 18:16.198
Oh, ho, ho, Milly's in.

18:16.302 --> 18:18.373
Oh, the food is fucking great.

18:18.476 --> 18:20.582
They've got this
duck spring roll.

18:20.685 --> 18:21.514
Wow, look at this.

18:21.617 --> 18:22.791
Veal shank.

18:22.894 --> 18:24.068
I mean, tender as shit.

18:24.172 --> 18:24.965
[interposing voices]

18:25.069 --> 18:25.897
Oh, wow.

18:26.001 --> 18:26.795
It's beautiful.

18:26.898 --> 18:27.692
MILLY: Come on.

18:27.796 --> 18:29.004
What more can you ask for?

18:29.108 --> 18:31.317
Robyn, what's it like
being the only girl?

18:31.420 --> 18:32.697
Um, it's different.

18:32.801 --> 18:34.630
But now it's just like I'm justtrying to earn their trust.

18:34.734 --> 18:35.838
I'm with them.

18:35.942 --> 18:37.392
NICK: I think the blue
team can mold Robyn

18:37.495 --> 18:38.703
into what we need her to be.

18:38.807 --> 18:40.843
It seems like she's
had a change of heart,

18:40.947 --> 18:42.086
especially after such--

18:42.190 --> 18:44.088
such a high note today
with the blue team.

18:44.192 --> 18:45.848
But if not, she needs to go.

18:45.952 --> 18:46.746
Congratulations.

18:46.849 --> 18:47.643
Cheers.

18:47.747 --> 18:54.305
[interposing voices]

18:54.409 --> 18:56.238
Uh, gross.

18:56.342 --> 18:57.929
That is disgusting.

19:02.279 --> 19:03.211
It doesn't matter.

19:03.314 --> 19:06.352
At least she's working, right?

19:06.455 --> 19:08.526
MANDA: Elise just is skatingthrough just like she

19:08.630 --> 19:10.873
does every other punishment.

19:10.977 --> 19:13.773
For somebody that's
so strong and so great

19:13.876 --> 19:17.501
and such a team player,she really doesn't do much.

19:17.604 --> 19:19.468
Did all these shelves
over here get wiped off?

19:19.572 --> 19:20.400
Yeah.

19:20.504 --> 19:21.505
All these?

19:21.608 --> 19:23.645
MICHELLE: You have to
finish all of them.

19:23.748 --> 19:25.233
But you have to move
all those pans first.

19:25.336 --> 19:26.475
No kidding.

19:26.579 --> 19:27.580
- Hey, what's with--- That's-- that's common sense.

19:27.683 --> 19:28.719
--with the attitude?

19:28.822 --> 19:29.927
I'm not an attitude,
but that's common sense.

19:30.030 --> 19:32.412
How can I wipe a shelf
with stuff on it?

19:32.516 --> 19:33.931
No shit, Sherlock.

19:34.034 --> 19:36.313
You're insulting
my intelligence.

19:36.416 --> 19:37.555
I'm beyond annoyed.

19:37.659 --> 19:38.798
And you call me rude.

19:38.901 --> 19:40.420
- I'm not rude, but--
- Yeah, you are.

19:40.524 --> 19:41.490
That's rude.
- No, I'm not.

19:41.594 --> 19:42.940
You're rude.- What's with the attitude?

19:43.043 --> 19:44.528
You really need to drop it.
You say that--

19:44.631 --> 19:45.632
ELISE: I don't have an attitude.

19:45.736 --> 19:48.394
You haven't begun to
see me get an attitude.

19:48.497 --> 19:49.636
She does a lot of this.

19:49.740 --> 19:51.293
Michelle talks too much.

19:51.397 --> 19:53.261
I really don't know, Michelle.

19:53.364 --> 19:56.954
Sometimes you are nailson a chalkboard annoying.

19:57.057 --> 19:57.989
I don't want to hear that shit.

19:58.093 --> 19:59.163
I'm trying to fucking focus.

19:59.267 --> 20:00.060
OK, Elise.

20:00.164 --> 20:00.992
Stop it.

20:11.934 --> 20:14.143
NARRATOR: After a longafternoon of manual labor

20:14.247 --> 20:15.075
for the red team--

20:15.179 --> 20:16.180
What's with the attitude?

20:16.284 --> 20:17.630
You really need to drop it.You say that--

20:17.733 --> 20:18.734
ELISE: I don't have an attitude.

20:18.838 --> 20:21.185
You haven't begun to
see me get an attitude.

20:21.289 --> 20:24.292
NARRATOR: Michelle and Eliseare at each other's throats.

20:24.395 --> 20:27.433
ELISE: Sometimes you are nailson a chalkboard annoying.

20:27.536 --> 20:28.468
I don't want to hear that shit.

20:28.572 --> 20:29.607
I'm trying to fucking focus.

20:29.711 --> 20:30.505
OK, Elise.

20:30.608 --> 20:31.402
Stop it.

20:33.301 --> 20:34.578
You know what?

20:34.681 --> 20:36.131
Look, I-- I don't want to haveany hard feelings with you.

20:36.235 --> 20:37.615
I'm sorry.
ELISE: Same here.

20:37.719 --> 20:38.582
Let's just-- let's just--

20:38.685 --> 20:39.479
ELISE: Yeah, let's
get through this.

20:39.583 --> 20:40.273
[inaudible]
- --keep cleaning.

20:40.377 --> 20:40.446
Yeah, let's just keep going.

20:42.448 --> 20:43.449
MICHELLE: Oh, they
look so happy.

20:43.552 --> 20:45.140
I love walking
into a sourpuss.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.660
My favorite.

20:47.763 --> 20:49.317
Looking good down there, Dana.

20:49.420 --> 20:50.628
Shut up, Van.

20:50.732 --> 20:52.389
[laughter]

20:52.492 --> 20:53.252
Whatever.

21:00.535 --> 21:02.053
I feel like we
should be downstairs

21:02.157 --> 21:02.985
doing dinner service.

21:03.089 --> 21:04.677
This is really fucking weird.

21:04.780 --> 21:06.161
I'm freaking out.

21:06.265 --> 21:07.231
[phone ringing]
[interposing voices]

21:07.335 --> 21:08.577
- Phone's ringing.
- Let's go.

21:11.408 --> 21:12.754
- Hello this is Michelle.- Michelle?

21:12.857 --> 21:13.858
It's chef here.
How are you?

21:13.962 --> 21:15.066
I'm good.
How are you, chef?

21:15.170 --> 21:15.964
GORDON RAMSAY [ON PHONE]: Good.Very well, indeed.

21:16.067 --> 21:17.345
Um, listen carefully.

21:17.448 --> 21:19.243
I need to see you
all immediately.

21:19.347 --> 21:20.451
Let's go.

21:20.555 --> 21:21.349
Yes, chef.

21:21.452 --> 21:22.764
That was Chef Ramsay.

21:22.867 --> 21:24.697
Go through the back
of the blue kitchen.

21:24.800 --> 21:26.457
Oh, shit.

21:26.561 --> 21:27.803
It's on.

21:27.907 --> 21:28.942
He said hurry.

21:29.046 --> 21:32.014
It's about to go up
in this piece right now.

21:32.118 --> 21:33.982
Come in, guys.

21:34.085 --> 21:36.087
Gather around.

21:36.191 --> 21:36.985
Come on, guys.

21:37.088 --> 21:37.882
Come on.

21:37.986 --> 21:40.333
Uh, relax.

21:40.437 --> 21:41.541
Why so nervous?

21:41.645 --> 21:42.508
Cause we just are, chef.

21:42.611 --> 21:43.612
GORDON RAMSAY:
Because you're what?

21:43.716 --> 21:44.717
DANA: We just are.

21:44.820 --> 21:46.063
GORDON RAMSAY: There's
something important

21:46.166 --> 21:47.720
I'd like to show you all.

21:47.823 --> 21:50.792
I'd like you all to
watch very carefully.

21:50.895 --> 21:55.659
Has anybody ever been to myflagship restaurant in Chelsea?

21:55.762 --> 21:56.763
No, chef.

21:56.867 --> 21:58.040
GORDON RAMSAY: This
is a signature dish.

21:58.144 --> 22:00.111
It's a tagliatelle of oysterswith an amazing Beurre

22:00.215 --> 22:02.907
champagne and finishedwith Ossetra caviar on top.

22:03.011 --> 22:03.839
OK?

22:03.943 --> 22:05.703
So it's put together in stages.

22:05.807 --> 22:08.223
Chef Ramsay is just casuallycooking with some champagne

22:08.327 --> 22:09.983
and oysters like it's
just another Monday.

22:10.087 --> 22:10.881
[pop]

22:10.984 --> 22:11.847
Oo.

22:11.951 --> 22:13.401
NICK: It's a very,
very fancy dish.

22:13.504 --> 22:15.782
Heh, he makes it look so easy.

22:15.886 --> 22:17.819
GORDON RAMSAY: So in
here I've got the most

22:17.922 --> 22:20.960
amazing oyster juice with what?

22:21.063 --> 22:21.995
Champagne.

22:22.099 --> 22:22.893
GORDON RAMSAY: Champagne.

22:22.996 --> 22:24.895
Cucumber up to the boil.

22:24.998 --> 22:27.829
Oysters, third time
on, drain them off.

22:27.932 --> 22:29.417
Otherwise, cucumber
overcooks very quickly.

22:29.520 --> 22:30.556
What happens to it?
[interposing voices]

22:30.659 --> 22:31.902
- It's mush.
- It's mushy.

22:32.005 --> 22:34.974
Now, from there, a touchof the beurre blanc in there.

22:35.077 --> 22:36.527
That's seasoned with?

22:36.631 --> 22:37.528
Chives.

22:37.632 --> 22:39.668
Next, tagliatelle.

22:39.772 --> 22:41.049
So, Van, how do you
get that in the shell?

22:41.152 --> 22:43.603
Uh, I would think fork.

22:43.707 --> 22:44.846
You're absolutely
right, young man.

22:44.949 --> 22:47.400
The pasta is the base, yes?

22:47.504 --> 22:48.643
Yes, chef.

22:48.746 --> 22:51.749
Thread, pick up, and twist.

22:51.853 --> 22:54.925
Twist, and in she goes.

22:55.028 --> 22:58.653
Now that sits up
there nice and tight.

22:58.756 --> 23:01.069
Now oysters, and you'll
see the aesthetics

23:01.172 --> 23:03.278
of the dish coming together.

23:03.382 --> 23:06.177
From there, take yourbeurre blanc, finish that.

23:06.281 --> 23:08.352
Whenever Chef Ramsay
is making a dish,

23:08.456 --> 23:10.699
you better damn
well pay attention.

23:10.803 --> 23:13.392
GORDON RAMSAY: Then
the caviar go on.

23:13.495 --> 23:15.532
DANA: As he's showing us,I'm trying to like soak

23:15.635 --> 23:17.672
it all in, following each step.

23:17.775 --> 23:19.846
GORDON RAMSAY: And then
tiny pluche just on top.

23:19.950 --> 23:22.124
DANA: I wish I had aphotographic memory right now.

23:22.228 --> 23:24.126
That would make my life
a whole lot easier.

23:24.230 --> 23:25.369
GORDON RAMSAY:
Tagliatelle of oysters.

23:25.473 --> 23:26.577
Were you watching carefully?

23:26.681 --> 23:27.647
Yes, chef.

23:27.751 --> 23:29.166
Now, all of you line up.

23:29.269 --> 23:30.616
Quick.

23:30.719 --> 23:33.584
DANA: I'm starting to feel thepressure because I'm like, OK,

23:33.688 --> 23:35.552
I'm going to have to
recreate this dish.

23:35.655 --> 23:36.449
I know it.

23:36.553 --> 23:37.623
Listen carefully.

23:37.726 --> 23:40.488
At this point, I've
got to concentrate

23:40.591 --> 23:44.975
on those chefs who areoperating at the highest level.

23:45.078 --> 23:48.185
So tonight I'm trimming the fat.

23:51.257 --> 23:54.847
Half of you will be competingin a very special challenge.

23:54.950 --> 23:57.505
And the chef who
is least successful

23:57.608 --> 23:59.955
recreating my
signature dish will be

24:00.059 --> 24:03.856
leaving Hell's Kitchen tonight.

24:03.959 --> 24:05.754
DANA: Oh, my god.

24:05.858 --> 24:08.377
I kind of feel like I'm
going to shit my pants.

24:08.481 --> 24:09.758
Michelle and Nick.

24:09.862 --> 24:10.863
Yes, chef?

24:10.966 --> 24:12.347
GORDON RAMSAY: In
our last challenge,

24:12.451 --> 24:16.800
you two were the last remainingchefs in each of your kitchens.

24:16.903 --> 24:22.184
With that in mind, I've decidedthat you will choose which half

24:22.288 --> 24:25.118
of your team will
be safe and which

24:25.222 --> 24:27.569
half will cook for their lives.

24:33.057 --> 24:34.956
I'm obviously happythat I don't have to risk

24:35.059 --> 24:36.371
my fate in this competition.

24:36.475 --> 24:38.615
But I don't want to have thatsort of animosity on my team.

24:38.718 --> 24:40.375
It's-- it sucks.

24:40.479 --> 24:43.343
Nick, I need one name
of one of the weaker

24:43.447 --> 24:46.277
chefs on the blue team.

24:46.381 --> 24:47.934
Robyn, chef.

24:48.038 --> 24:48.797
GORDON RAMSAY: Robyn.

24:48.901 --> 24:50.247
Why?

24:50.350 --> 24:52.076
Uh, Robyn struggled a littlebit, and I think this has her--

24:52.180 --> 24:54.769
her time to shine.

24:54.872 --> 24:55.770
Michelle, one name, please.

25:00.809 --> 25:02.846
Barbie, chef.

25:02.949 --> 25:04.364
Barbie?
BARBIE: Yes, chef?

25:04.468 --> 25:05.573
First pick on the red team.

25:05.676 --> 25:06.470
Why?

25:06.574 --> 25:08.714
I'm always first pick.

25:08.817 --> 25:11.095
I'm going to be the
last one standing.

25:11.199 --> 25:13.581
Nick, second name
and why, please.

25:13.684 --> 25:15.859
I'm going to go
with Gio, chef.

25:15.962 --> 25:16.756
GORDON RAMSAY: Gio?

25:16.860 --> 25:18.137
Why?

25:18.240 --> 25:19.690
Sometimes he can get a littlefrazzled and overwhelmed.

25:19.794 --> 25:21.589
GIOVANNI: I don't think I'mone of the weakest chefs here,

25:21.692 --> 25:22.762
and I don't know
why he picked me.

25:22.866 --> 25:23.832
I've just got to
prove him wrong.

25:23.936 --> 25:24.937
Fuck him.

25:25.040 --> 25:26.525
Michelle, second
name and why, please.

25:26.628 --> 25:27.664
Manda, chef.

25:27.767 --> 25:28.768
GORDON RAMSAY: Manda.

25:28.872 --> 25:30.321
I never back down
from a challenge,

25:30.425 --> 25:32.013
and I'm a feisty little fighter.

25:32.116 --> 25:34.429
If I'm going to have to cookfor my life, bring it on.

25:34.533 --> 25:37.018
All this is going to
do is make me stronger.

25:37.121 --> 25:40.435
Nick, third and finalindividual from the blue team.

25:40.539 --> 25:41.643
I'm going to go
with Milly, chef.

25:41.747 --> 25:42.989
GORDON RAMSAY: Milly?
NICK: Yep.

25:43.093 --> 25:44.335
GORDON RAMSAY: Why?

25:44.439 --> 25:45.992
Uh, I'd like to see Millykind of step it up a little bit

25:46.096 --> 25:48.063
and see if he can finessefull with this dish.

25:48.167 --> 25:49.444
Like, come on, Nick.

25:49.548 --> 25:51.101
I thought you'd been payingattention a little bit more.

25:51.204 --> 25:54.069
You ain't seen all the shitI've been putting down, bro?

25:54.173 --> 25:56.347
Michelle, third and finalperson on the red team.

26:00.489 --> 26:01.283
Michelle?

26:10.292 --> 26:11.604
NARRATOR: In tonight's
daunting "cook

26:11.708 --> 26:12.847

The chef who is
least successful

26:15.470 --> 26:17.817
recreating my
signature dish will be

26:17.921 --> 26:20.095
leaving Hell's Kitchen tonight.

26:20.199 --> 26:22.201
NARRATOR: --Chef Ramsay
has asked the two chefs

26:22.304 --> 26:25.756
from the "last chef standing"challenge, Nick and Michelle,

26:25.860 --> 26:29.346
to decide who were the threeweakest members on their team.

26:29.449 --> 26:33.695
Nick, you chose Robyn, Milly,and Geo as your weakness three.

26:33.799 --> 26:35.007
Yes, chef.

26:35.110 --> 26:37.872
Michelle, you chose Barbieand Manda as your weakest.

26:37.975 --> 26:39.736
Third and final person
on the red team?

26:44.430 --> 26:45.396
Elise, chef.

26:45.500 --> 26:46.294
Elise?

26:46.397 --> 26:47.364
MICHELLE: Yes, chef.

26:47.467 --> 26:48.607
GORDON RAMSAY: Why?

26:48.710 --> 26:50.332
MICHELLE: Uh, she's notnecessarily a team player,

26:50.436 --> 26:52.818
and I think that she needs
to step it up a notch.

26:52.921 --> 26:53.922
ELISE: OK, it's game on.

26:54.026 --> 26:54.923
I came here.

26:55.027 --> 26:56.442
I tried to be fucking
nice to people.

26:56.545 --> 26:57.961
I'm not playing nice no more.

26:58.064 --> 27:01.102
She better hope I
go home tonight.

27:01.205 --> 27:05.347
You six remaining chefs thatare safe head to the patio

27:05.451 --> 27:07.764
and wait to see
who will join you.

27:07.867 --> 27:09.248
Get out of here.
- You've got this.

27:09.351 --> 27:10.698
- I know.
- Good luck.

27:10.801 --> 27:11.906
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

27:12.009 --> 27:13.459
- I'll see you later.
- I know I'm not going.

27:13.562 --> 27:14.805
- See you later.
- Good luck.

27:14.909 --> 27:16.531
ELISE: Dana or Jennifer shouldbe cooking for their life,

27:16.635 --> 27:17.946
definitely not me.

27:18.050 --> 27:20.397
But I knew Michelle would nameme because I'm a threat to her.

27:20.500 --> 27:21.640
I'm not going home tonight.

27:21.743 --> 27:23.020
Sorry.

27:23.124 --> 27:26.852
You're all going to have 30minutes to replicate my dish.

27:26.955 --> 27:30.338
And your time starts now.

27:30.441 --> 27:32.443
Let's go.

27:32.547 --> 27:34.273
NARRATOR: In the "cookfor your life" challenge,

27:34.376 --> 27:36.551
the six chefs who

27:36.655 --> 27:40.106
have one chance to recreateChef Ramsay's oyster tagliatelle

27:40.210 --> 27:42.281
appetizer in just 30 minutes.

27:42.384 --> 27:43.316
Come on, ladies.

27:43.420 --> 27:44.663
You can do this.

27:44.766 --> 27:46.423
NARRATOR: And the chef withthe least successful dish

27:46.526 --> 27:47.735
will be going home.

27:47.838 --> 27:48.667
GORDON RAMSAY: Don't
shake that champagne.

27:48.770 --> 27:49.702
Yes, chef.

27:49.806 --> 27:52.118
Doing a dish that
I just saw one time,

27:52.222 --> 27:53.948
I've got 30 minutes
to cook for my life.

27:54.051 --> 27:54.880
Crazy!

27:54.983 --> 27:56.088
Like this is crazy.

28:03.267 --> 28:05.822
You could cut the intensitywith fucking knife.

28:08.790 --> 28:11.828
This is everybody for
themselves right now.

28:11.931 --> 28:13.036
Sorry, ladies.

28:13.139 --> 28:14.037
I'm staying.

28:14.140 --> 28:16.177
Somebody else is
going home, not me.

28:20.215 --> 28:21.527
GIOVANNI: I didn't
come here to go home.

28:21.630 --> 28:22.942
And I plan on winning
this fucking thing.

28:23.046 --> 28:25.565
And I plan on beatingwhoever's in front of me.

28:25.669 --> 28:27.360
I'm coming out as this
fucking thing alive.

28:27.464 --> 28:28.534
Just over five minutes gone.

28:28.637 --> 28:29.846
25 minutes remaining.

28:29.949 --> 28:31.882
25 minutes remaining, chef.

28:31.986 --> 28:35.541
MILLY: Why's Nick put me in thispool with these little guppies?

28:35.644 --> 28:38.682
I felt bad because I've
comfortable as shit.

28:38.786 --> 28:40.028
It's a beurre blanc.

28:40.132 --> 28:43.514
Beurre blanc is the firstsauce I ever made in my life.

28:43.618 --> 28:45.793
It's pasta and oysters--

28:45.896 --> 28:48.071
something that I love to eat--

28:48.174 --> 28:52.040
and champagne, something youcatch me with in the club

28:52.144 --> 28:54.733
every motherfucking night.

28:54.836 --> 28:55.872
You guys OK?

28:55.975 --> 28:57.114
- Yeah.
- OK?

28:57.218 --> 28:58.012
You OK?

28:58.115 --> 28:59.254
Yeah.

28:59.358 --> 29:01.291
I used to be the souschef of a fish restaurant,

29:01.394 --> 29:03.949
and we shucked
oysters every night.

29:04.052 --> 29:06.986
I shucked the shit out
of some fucking oysters,

29:07.090 --> 29:09.955
and I'm fine with this challengebecause cooking for my life

29:10.058 --> 29:14.028
gets to show Chef Ramsay that Icame here to cook for my life.

29:15.098 --> 29:16.064
Start turning.

29:16.168 --> 29:17.963
I also got to make pasta.

29:18.066 --> 29:19.861
Let me show you how it's done.

29:19.965 --> 29:21.656
GORDON RAMSAY: Not toomuch tagliatelle in there.

29:23.900 --> 29:25.280
Don't go crazy with the pasta.

29:25.384 --> 29:26.143
No.

29:28.905 --> 29:30.113
ROBYN: This is it--

29:30.216 --> 29:31.390
do or die time.

29:31.493 --> 29:33.599
Attention to detail.

29:33.702 --> 29:35.463
One, two, three, four--

29:35.566 --> 29:37.948
fuck my life.

29:38.052 --> 29:41.193
One mountain, two mountain,three mountain, four mountain.

29:41.296 --> 29:44.092
I'm realizing that my nerves,my anxiety is getting to me.

29:44.196 --> 29:48.131
Like, my hands cannot
stop shaking right now.

29:48.234 --> 29:51.065
My hand's just so
slimy right now.

29:51.168 --> 29:52.791
I'm having a lot oftrouble with these oysters,

29:52.894 --> 29:55.345
so I keep on talking tomyself and just pepping myself

29:55.448 --> 29:56.346
up, saying, come on, Robyn.

29:56.449 --> 29:57.347
You can get through this.

29:57.450 --> 29:58.244
You can do this.

30:00.729 --> 30:01.523
How many do you need?

30:01.627 --> 30:02.697
Only six, right?

30:02.801 --> 30:04.216
I'm just making sure
for insurance purposes.

30:04.319 --> 30:05.251
OK.

30:05.355 --> 30:06.632
Come on.

30:06.735 --> 30:08.358
ELISE: This is a challengewhere you could make one mistake

30:08.461 --> 30:09.393
and get sent home.

30:09.497 --> 30:10.463
Your heart is racing.

30:10.567 --> 30:11.430
On top of that, your nerves.

30:11.533 --> 30:12.327
It's a lot.

30:12.431 --> 30:13.639
Ah!

30:13.742 --> 30:15.020
You OK, Elise.

30:15.123 --> 30:15.952

30:18.230 --> 30:19.024
90 seconds.

30:19.127 --> 30:19.921
--wow.

30:23.752 --> 30:25.064
GORDON RAMSAY: 55 seconds to go.

30:25.168 --> 30:26.894

30:29.862 --> 30:30.967
GORDON RAMSAY: 20
seconds remaining.

30:31.070 --> 30:32.900
Oh, my god.

You got this.

30:42.530 --> 30:44.877
GORDON RAMSAY: --two, one.

30:44.981 --> 30:45.913
That is it.

30:46.016 --> 30:47.190

30:47.293 --> 30:48.570
- Yes, chef.
- Oof.

30:48.674 --> 30:49.778
GORDON RAMSAY: All
of you, well done.

30:49.882 --> 30:51.332
Well done.

30:51.435 --> 30:53.368
You guys, who do you think'sgoing to walk through the door

30:53.472 --> 30:54.611
first?
- I don't know.

30:54.714 --> 30:55.715
Milly.

30:55.819 --> 30:56.924
I don't want Manda to go.

30:57.027 --> 30:58.546
It needs to be Barbie or Elise.

30:58.649 --> 30:59.823
It's not going to be Elise.

30:59.927 --> 31:01.342
So what happens
if Elise comes back?

31:01.445 --> 31:02.930
If you thought Elise
didn't like you before,

31:03.033 --> 31:03.827
just fucking wait.

31:03.931 --> 31:04.759
I don't give a fuck.

31:04.863 --> 31:07.003
Oh, god.

31:07.106 --> 31:09.074
Now that you've all
cooked for your life,

31:09.177 --> 31:11.697
it's time to find out who'sstaying and who's leaving.

31:14.596 --> 31:16.288
Elise, you OK?

31:16.391 --> 31:17.254
[sniffle]

31:17.358 --> 31:19.015
You cut yourself?

31:19.118 --> 31:19.912
What's wrong?

31:20.016 --> 31:21.086
Nothing, chef.

31:21.189 --> 31:22.811
GORDON RAMSAY: Well,clearly something's wrong.

31:22.915 --> 31:24.503
ELISE: I don't think I
deserve to be up here.

31:24.606 --> 31:26.677
The key word was the
three weakest chefs.

31:26.781 --> 31:29.542
But this is do or die.

31:29.646 --> 31:31.613
OK.

31:31.717 --> 31:34.754
Manda, please grab your dish,come on up, very carefully.

31:34.858 --> 31:35.894
Yes, chef.

31:35.997 --> 31:37.930
MANDA: This is the most
important dish I have

31:38.034 --> 31:39.759
ever made in my entire life.

31:39.863 --> 31:41.554
It's all in Chef Ramsay's hands.

31:41.658 --> 31:43.694
So describe your dish, please.

31:43.798 --> 31:47.664
MANDA: I did shallots,peppercorns, and champagne.

31:47.767 --> 31:48.907
Cooked that down to sec.

31:49.010 --> 31:52.117
Hit it with a bunch ofbutter, just really slow.

31:52.220 --> 31:53.221
Sauce is good.

31:53.325 --> 31:54.567
Thank you, chef.

31:54.671 --> 31:55.879
This one is a strong effort.

31:55.983 --> 31:57.708
A little bit more
generous in the sauce.

31:57.812 --> 32:00.401
You got sauce beautifullydone there, no sauce there.

32:00.504 --> 32:02.506
But we'll find out how
you did in a minute.

32:02.610 --> 32:03.818
Thank you.
- Thank you, chef.

32:03.922 --> 32:05.026
Take the dish back.
Thank you.

32:05.130 --> 32:06.579
Strong effort.
Very strong.

32:06.683 --> 32:07.546
Next up, Milly.

32:07.649 --> 32:08.823
Let's go.

32:08.927 --> 32:12.413
MILLY: I'm about to putdown the perfect recreation

32:12.516 --> 32:13.793
of Chef Ramsay's dish.

32:13.897 --> 32:16.486
Watch what's about to happen.

32:16.589 --> 32:18.695
Visually beautiful.

32:18.798 --> 32:21.732
The ratio of the pasta,
absolutely spot on.

32:21.836 --> 32:23.044
How long did you poach
your oysters for?

32:23.148 --> 32:25.840
Just put the, uh, uh,
champagne up to warm,

32:25.944 --> 32:27.255
put it off the stove,
set it to the side.

32:27.359 --> 32:28.394
GORDON RAMSAY: That's beautiful.

32:28.498 --> 32:31.466
I mean, really beautiful,beautifully done.

32:31.570 --> 32:32.502
What's missing, Milly?

32:36.989 --> 32:38.577
Um, I think I forgot
the, uh, peppercorns

32:38.680 --> 32:40.786
in my beurre blanc, Chef.

32:40.889 --> 32:41.994
GORDON RAMSAY: What's
missing, Milly?

32:48.035 --> 32:48.828
Um.

32:52.177 --> 32:55.663
What's missing, Milly?

32:55.766 --> 32:57.182
I can't remember, chef.

32:57.285 --> 32:58.493
Um.

32:58.597 --> 33:00.840
How many oysters did I make?

33:00.944 --> 33:02.325
MILLY: How many did you make?

33:02.428 --> 33:03.567
You made six.

33:03.671 --> 33:04.465
Oh, shit.

33:12.162 --> 33:13.992
NARRATOR: In this nerve-wracking"cook for your life"

33:14.095 --> 33:15.372

33:18.858 --> 33:21.240

GORDON RAMSAY: That's beautiful.

33:22.414 --> 33:23.587

33:23.691 --> 33:26.797
NARRATOR: --except for onerather important detail.

33:26.901 --> 33:29.352
What's missing, Milly?

33:29.455 --> 33:31.147
Um.

33:31.250 --> 33:33.494
How many oysters did I make?

33:33.597 --> 33:34.943
MILLY: How many did you make?

33:35.047 --> 33:36.255
You made six.

33:36.359 --> 33:37.222
Oh, shit.

33:40.294 --> 33:43.745
How the fuck did I forgetto put this oyster on there?

33:46.886 --> 33:48.543
I should embarrassed.

33:48.647 --> 33:50.545
You made one mistake.

33:50.649 --> 33:52.237
Everything else is flawless.

33:56.068 --> 33:57.828
Question for me, is yourdish better than Manda's?

34:03.282 --> 34:06.113
It's better than Amanda's.

34:06.216 --> 34:07.459
You're safe.

34:07.562 --> 34:08.391
Thank you, chef.

34:08.494 --> 34:09.461
GORDON RAMSAY:
Head to the patio.

34:09.564 --> 34:14.949
[vocalizations] I'm gone.

34:15.053 --> 34:16.226
See ya.

34:16.330 --> 34:17.124
Milly!

34:17.227 --> 34:18.056
[cheers and applause]

34:18.159 --> 34:20.334
[laughter]

34:20.437 --> 34:21.680
Yass, queen.

34:21.783 --> 34:23.095
Yay!

34:23.199 --> 34:24.303
Perfect, motherfucker.

34:24.407 --> 34:25.201
I love it.

34:25.304 --> 34:26.926
Only thing I fucked more--

34:27.030 --> 34:28.997
only made five
spaces for myself.

34:29.101 --> 34:29.998
So it wasn't perfect.

34:30.102 --> 34:32.725
Perfect!

34:32.829 --> 34:37.420
Next up, Barbie.

34:37.523 --> 34:39.422
BARBIE: I'm really
confident about my dish.

34:39.525 --> 34:42.701
I don't who's going home,but, um, it's not me.

34:49.466 --> 34:50.295
ELISE:

34:50.398 --> 34:51.848
Visually, what do you think?

34:51.951 --> 34:53.160
I think though
it has a little--

34:53.263 --> 34:55.748
a lot of pasta.

34:55.852 --> 34:57.716
Why so much pasta?

34:57.819 --> 35:00.477
That's one of the thingsI struggled with, chef.

35:00.581 --> 35:01.823
Beurre blanc delicious.

35:01.927 --> 35:04.516
Cucumber still crunchy.

35:04.619 --> 35:05.586
Take it back, please.

35:05.689 --> 35:07.139
I have to say between
you and Manda.

35:07.243 --> 35:08.036
Yes, chef.

35:10.970 --> 35:11.799
Manda.

35:11.902 --> 35:12.765
Yes, chef.

35:12.869 --> 35:15.043
I'm sorry to say
you, young lady,

35:15.147 --> 35:16.838
are putting up with
me for a lot longer.

35:16.942 --> 35:17.874
Head to the patio.

35:17.977 --> 35:19.703
Thank you, chef.

35:19.807 --> 35:20.601
Holy shit.

35:20.704 --> 35:21.498
I'm safe.

35:21.602 --> 35:23.949
Thank god.

35:24.052 --> 35:25.261
Get me out of this kitchen.

35:25.364 --> 35:26.676
Get me out of this dining room.

35:26.779 --> 35:28.747
I want to go see my team now.

35:28.850 --> 35:31.681
When a motherfucker looklike me walk in the kitchen,

35:31.784 --> 35:33.096
y'all better say
"parlez vous francais."

35:33.200 --> 35:35.547
You bitches can't

35:35.650 --> 35:36.513
[cheers]

35:36.617 --> 35:37.514
Yes way!

35:37.618 --> 35:39.999
I'm so glad you're here.

35:40.103 --> 35:42.416
I'm not going anywhere,
you son of a bitch.

35:42.519 --> 35:45.315
In other words,
Elise is crying.

35:45.419 --> 35:48.767
[cheers]

35:48.870 --> 35:51.356
Next up, Robyn, please.

35:51.459 --> 35:52.288
Let's go.

35:52.391 --> 35:53.461
ROBYN: I got this.

35:53.565 --> 35:55.739
I know Chef Ramsay's
going to love my dish.

35:55.843 --> 35:56.982
Here you go, chef.

35:57.085 --> 35:59.674
I'm hoping that he thinksthis dish is perfect.

35:59.778 --> 36:01.262
You seemed to struggle
opening the oysters.

36:01.366 --> 36:02.401
What happened?

36:02.505 --> 36:04.334
ROBYN: I had a problem
opening three of them.

36:04.438 --> 36:06.094
Yeah.

36:06.198 --> 36:07.061
I can't eat that.

36:07.165 --> 36:08.131
ROBYN: I'm sorry, chef.

36:08.235 --> 36:09.028
What happened there?

36:09.132 --> 36:10.858
I guess I stabbed it too hard.

36:10.961 --> 36:11.790
I didn't realize I cut it.

36:11.893 --> 36:13.274
GORDON RAMSAY:
That looks gashed.

36:13.378 --> 36:14.379
Have you opened oysters before?

36:14.482 --> 36:15.242
Yes, chef.

36:18.210 --> 36:19.246
GORDON RAMSAY:
Four good, two bad.

36:19.349 --> 36:20.350
- Thank you, chef.
- Back in line.

36:20.454 --> 36:21.213
Yes, chef.

36:24.561 --> 36:27.944
Those fucking
two damn oysters.

36:28.047 --> 36:29.187
My god.

36:29.290 --> 36:31.568
GORDON RAMSAY: So it'sbetween Barbie and Robyn.

36:31.672 --> 36:32.466
Yes, chef.

36:37.643 --> 36:38.472
Robyn.

36:38.575 --> 36:39.852
Yes, chef.

36:39.956 --> 36:41.820
GORDON RAMSAY: You're goingto have to beat Elise or Gio.

36:41.923 --> 36:42.924
Barbie, head to the patio.

36:43.028 --> 36:43.822
Yes, chef.

36:46.376 --> 36:48.965
BARBIE: I survived the night,but Michelle is probably

36:49.068 --> 36:52.348
freaking out because if Elisecomes through these doors,

36:52.451 --> 36:53.970
she's going to be mad as hell.

36:54.073 --> 36:57.801
[cheers and laughter]

36:57.905 --> 36:59.044
Was Elise still crying?

36:59.147 --> 37:00.908
Yeah.

37:01.011 --> 37:01.805
Elise, let's go.

37:08.226 --> 37:10.573
ELISE: I'm upset because I'm notthe weakest member of the team.

37:10.676 --> 37:11.919
I've been nice.

37:12.022 --> 37:13.886
I've been nothing but a teamplayer since I've been here.

37:13.990 --> 37:15.405
I don't deserve to
go home tonight.

37:15.509 --> 37:17.131
[sniffle]

37:17.235 --> 37:18.995
Visually, I think
it's beautiful.

37:22.067 --> 37:23.862
How long did you
poach the oysters for?

37:23.965 --> 37:25.312
Very briefly.

37:25.415 --> 37:27.797
I just put them in a champagne,warmed it up and pulled it off,

37:27.900 --> 37:30.317
and let it poach on the side.

37:30.420 --> 37:33.872
Why stick the shell
so far into the salt?

37:33.975 --> 37:35.080
I was getting it
to stand up, chef.

37:35.183 --> 37:35.977
I'm sorry.

37:36.081 --> 37:37.082
What happens to that salt?

37:37.185 --> 37:38.256
It gets inside.

37:38.359 --> 37:39.981
What do oysters taste of?

37:40.085 --> 37:40.879
Salt.

37:40.982 --> 37:42.260
What does caviar taste of?

37:42.363 --> 37:43.157
Salt.

37:43.261 --> 37:44.883
[sigh]

37:44.986 --> 37:47.230
Back in line.

37:47.334 --> 37:48.507
ROBYN: What was that, chef?

37:48.611 --> 37:50.613
You just got a mouthfulof salt because Elise put

37:50.716 --> 37:52.373
her shells too far in the salt?

37:52.477 --> 37:54.720
Elise, it's too bad that
you had the extra salt.

37:54.824 --> 37:57.827
You submerged them a
little bit too deep.

37:57.930 --> 37:58.759
OK.

37:58.862 --> 38:00.001
Between Robyn and Elise.

38:03.315 --> 38:06.007
Elise, your dish is
better than Robyn's.

38:06.111 --> 38:06.974
Thank you, chef.

38:07.077 --> 38:07.595
GORDON RAMSAY:
Head to the patio.

38:07.699 --> 38:08.389
Thank you, chef.

38:08.493 --> 38:09.563
GORDON RAMSAY: You are safe.

38:09.666 --> 38:11.289
ELISE: I'm extremely
excited that I'm safe,

38:11.392 --> 38:15.569
and I'm ready to go fuckingrub it in Michelle's face.

38:15.672 --> 38:17.709
Definitely not letting
Michelle get off easy.

38:17.812 --> 38:21.506
Now I'm not being nice anymore.

38:21.609 --> 38:22.507
Whew!

38:22.610 --> 38:23.542
It's on.

38:23.646 --> 38:24.750
Oh.

38:24.854 --> 38:25.682
[interposing voices]

38:25.786 --> 38:26.718
You opened a can of worms.

NARRATOR: In today's "cookfor your life" challenge--

38:51.708 --> 38:54.262

- Thank you.- Guess who's [inaudible]?

39:07.793 --> 39:09.312
You thought it was
going to be that easy?

39:09.416 --> 39:10.382
Why is this happening?

39:10.486 --> 39:11.279
I don't know.

39:11.383 --> 39:12.626
Get used to this face.

39:12.729 --> 39:14.144
Your crying face?

39:14.248 --> 39:18.217
NARRATOR: --with Elise clearlydeclaring war on Michelle.

NARRATOR: And Giovanni
is hoping his dish

39:25.673 --> 39:27.123
will keep him from going home.

39:27.226 --> 39:28.400
GIOVANNI: I'm not
ready to go home.

39:28.504 --> 39:29.815
I don't want to go home.

39:29.919 --> 39:31.576
And, uh, you want to make hisdecision as hard as possible.

39:31.679 --> 39:32.473
And we'll see what he'll--

39:32.577 --> 39:33.647
we'll see what he does.

39:33.750 --> 39:38.755
The presentation ofthis one, it's beautiful.

39:38.859 --> 39:39.860
Oh, fuck.

39:39.963 --> 39:41.240
GORDON RAMSAY: What's
missing in there?

39:41.344 --> 39:42.932
What's missing in there?

39:43.035 --> 39:43.864
Sauce?

39:43.967 --> 39:45.141
A little light on the sauce.

39:45.244 --> 39:46.418
GORDON RAMSAY: What's
missing in there?

39:46.522 --> 39:47.626
GIOVANNI: Light on
the sauce, chef.

39:47.730 --> 39:48.558

missing in there.

39:48.662 --> 39:49.973

the sauce, chef.

GORDON RAMSAY: What happened?GIOVANNI: I put the sauce on it.

39:51.630 --> 39:52.562
I-- I just didn't put enough.

39:57.153 --> 39:58.534
Why so much pasta?

39:58.637 --> 39:59.535
I don't know, chef.

39:59.638 --> 40:03.124
I was trying to
twirl it, and I guess

40:03.228 --> 40:04.436
in the middle of panicking.

40:04.540 --> 40:07.128
There's one thing I'vewelcomed in this competition,

40:07.232 --> 40:09.268
is your composure.

40:09.372 --> 40:14.135
I don't expect the word
panic coming from you.

40:14.239 --> 40:15.240
Back in line, please.

40:15.343 --> 40:17.587
GIOVANNI: Yes, chef.

40:17.691 --> 40:18.519
GORDON RAMSAY: Oh, man.

40:22.592 --> 40:28.287
Sadly, one of you is going home,and the dream ends tonight.

40:28.391 --> 40:31.256
Gio, you had too much pasta.

40:31.359 --> 40:34.293
Robyn, you struggled
opening the oysters.

40:34.397 --> 40:36.019
Yes, chef.

40:36.123 --> 40:45.960
My decision is Robyn,
head to the patio.

40:46.064 --> 40:47.030
Holy shit.

40:47.134 --> 40:50.033
Thank you, chef.

40:50.137 --> 40:52.415
Oh.

40:52.519 --> 40:53.865
I'm glad you came back.
- Thank you.

40:53.968 --> 40:54.728
Look after that family.

40:54.831 --> 40:55.660
I will.

40:55.763 --> 40:57.869
Jacket off, please.

40:57.972 --> 40:59.733
[sigh]

40:59.836 --> 41:01.597
It just wasn't your night, Gio.- Right.

41:01.700 --> 41:02.667
Thank you.
- Bye.

41:02.770 --> 41:03.564
Take care, chef.

41:03.668 --> 41:06.187
Take care, bud.

41:06.291 --> 41:07.430
GIOVANNI: Chef made a decision.

41:07.534 --> 41:08.604
That's final.

41:08.707 --> 41:10.295
I mean, maybe at my
age and my experience,

41:10.398 --> 41:11.365
I should have done a better job.

41:11.469 --> 41:12.746
But I'm holding my head up high.

41:12.849 --> 41:14.092
And, uh, I'mma
going home and I get

41:14.195 --> 41:15.645
hugged by two beautiful kids--

41:15.749 --> 41:16.957
nothing to be ashamed of.

41:17.060 --> 41:19.131
It's an opportunity
of a lifetime.

41:19.235 --> 41:22.238
So, yeah, I'm glad I cameback, glad I gave it a shot--

41:22.341 --> 41:23.791
came up short.

41:23.895 --> 41:25.759
[cheers]

41:34.353 --> 41:35.216
Yeah, baby.

41:35.320 --> 41:37.495
I'm still here, bitches.

41:37.598 --> 41:39.324
I told you you could do it.

41:39.427 --> 41:40.601
I feel like I'm the underdog.

41:40.705 --> 41:41.809
Pow, pow, pow.

41:41.913 --> 41:44.053
I'm finally breaking
through my shell.

41:44.156 --> 41:45.054
That's how you do it.

41:45.157 --> 41:46.434
- Yes!
- [inaudible]

41:47.435 --> 41:48.333
Who's weak?

41:48.436 --> 41:49.748
ELISE: I'm the
strongest on the team.

41:49.852 --> 41:51.198
And they know it.
Michelle knows it.

41:51.301 --> 41:53.096
But she must've not
watched season nine.

41:53.200 --> 41:54.960
Let the games begin.

41:55.064 --> 41:57.100
I'm coming for you,
so you better bring all

41:57.204 --> 41:59.102
that shit every fucking day.

41:59.206 --> 42:01.588
Ding, dong, the
witch is alive.

42:01.691 --> 42:03.003
I wouldn't want to be
Michelle right now.

42:03.106 --> 42:03.900
Wait, wait, wait.

42:04.004 --> 42:05.246
That means Gio's gone.

42:05.350 --> 42:06.144
Yes.

42:06.247 --> 42:07.663
[laughter]

42:07.766 --> 42:08.836
GORDON RAMSAY
[VOICEOVER]: Giovanni

42:08.940 --> 42:11.045
may have age and experience,but his attention

42:11.149 --> 42:13.185
to detail in this
critical challenge

42:13.289 --> 42:14.704
was a big disappointment.

42:14.808 --> 42:15.774
Arrivederci, Giovanni.

42:22.194 --> 42:23.989
NARRATOR: Next time
on "Hell's Kitchen"--

42:24.093 --> 42:25.094
This is the new Elise.

42:25.197 --> 42:26.785
NARRATOR: --Elise
is on the warpath.

42:26.889 --> 42:28.511
ELISE: No more playing nice now.

42:28.615 --> 42:29.788
I don't trust her.

42:29.892 --> 42:31.859
NARRATOR: And when the redteam has an intervention--

42:31.963 --> 42:33.378
Yeah, we just want
to be on the same page.

42:33.481 --> 42:34.482
Yikes.

42:34.586 --> 42:36.139
NARRATOR: --will it
send her over the edge?

42:36.243 --> 42:37.416
Elise, does this
look all right?

42:37.520 --> 42:38.763
I don't care how
your ponytail look.

42:38.866 --> 42:39.867
Now it's on.

42:39.971 --> 42:41.317
NARRATOR: Can any of
her teammates stop her?

42:41.420 --> 42:42.387
I thought we were friends.

42:42.490 --> 42:43.457
There's no friendship here.

42:43.561 --> 42:44.941
NARRATOR: Or Chef Christina?

42:45.045 --> 42:45.839
You settle down today?

42:45.942 --> 42:47.530
Get the fuck out of here.

42:47.634 --> 42:48.807
NARRATOR: Or Chef Ramsay?

42:48.911 --> 42:50.913
GORDON RAMSAY: Elise, there'sbeen a massive meltdown.

42:51.016 --> 42:51.948
NARRATOR: Find out next time--

42:52.052 --> 42:52.880
Oh!

42:52.984 --> 42:54.295
Not sorry.

42:54.399 --> 42:58.230
NARRATOR: --on a primal episodeof "Hells' Kitchen All Stars."
