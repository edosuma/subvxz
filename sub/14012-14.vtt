<i>in the criminal justice system,</i>
<i> the people are represented</i>

00:03.370 --> 00:06.205
<i> by two separate</i>
<i> yet equally important groups:</i>

00:06.207 --> 00:08.207
<i> The police,</i>

00:08.209 --> 00:11.010
<i> and the district attorneys,</i>
<i> who prosecute the offenders.</i>

00:11.012 --> 00:13.412
<i> These are their stories.</i>

00:28.529 --> 00:30.529
A Sunday night, huh?

00:30.531 --> 00:34.166
If you were off,
this what you'd be doing?

00:34.168 --> 00:37.302
I'd be tuning my Harley...
or Mary Louise.

00:37.304 --> 00:38.537
(<i> laughs</i> )

00:38.539 --> 00:40.172
Come on.

00:40.174 --> 00:41.273
Break it up.

00:41.275 --> 00:42.541
Just relax.
You'll get in.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.176
It's not a problem.

00:44.178 --> 00:45.244
Get the manager out here.

00:45.246 --> 00:47.146
Is there a problem?

00:47.148 --> 00:48.514
You got excessive
noise, loitering...

00:48.516 --> 00:50.449
my feet are moving.
Not me--

00:50.451 --> 00:52.151
Peter, come on!

00:52.153 --> 00:54.253
I was talking
to the policeman.
Where are you going?

00:54.255 --> 00:56.155
The car's over there.
We got to go home.

00:56.157 --> 00:57.156
At midnight?
Come on.

00:57.158 --> 00:59.158
Let's go to Nirvana.

00:59.159 --> 01:01.159
It's time to go home, Peter.
It's not time
to go home.

01:01.162 --> 01:02.394
Give me a kiss.

01:02.396 --> 01:05.164
I don't want
to give you a kiss.

01:05.166 --> 01:06.398
(<i> laughs</i> )

01:06.400 --> 01:08.467
(<i> screams</i> )

01:09.437 --> 01:12.137
Nobody saw her
at the club.

01:12.139 --> 01:14.506
invisible out here?
What? Was she

01:14.508 --> 01:18.410
Tore the necklace so hard,
it took skin with it.

01:18.412 --> 01:20.479
Lois Ryder, 16 East 85.

01:20.481 --> 01:22.381
Off the park. Nice.

01:22.383 --> 01:24.116
Saperstein, 3-6.

01:24.118 --> 01:26.368
Phil Cerreta,
Mike Logan.

01:26.369 --> 01:28.619
What's the matter, you
don't get enough work
in your own turf?

01:28.622 --> 01:31.623
Hit her in the head,
maybe a baseball bat?

01:31.625 --> 01:33.425
Took the jewelry,
left the credit cards?

01:33.427 --> 01:35.561
Case closed.
You got the guy booked?

01:35.563 --> 01:38.163
Last six weeks,
two within ten blocks.

01:38.165 --> 01:40.132
I didn't see it
on the boroughs sheet.
No, no, no.

01:40.134 --> 01:42.301
We don't want the M.O. out.
We gagged it downtown.

01:42.303 --> 01:44.236
The guy hits them with a bat,
takes the jewelry

01:44.238 --> 01:45.237
leaves the cards.

01:45.239 --> 01:47.239
What do you got?

01:47.240 --> 01:49.240
Hits them with a bat,
takes the jewelry

01:49.243 --> 01:50.309
leaves the cards.

01:50.311 --> 01:52.111
We got nothing.

01:55.416 --> 01:59.351
   Captionining sponsored by
   NBC/Universal

03:15.496 --> 03:17.896
CERRETA:
a difficult time.

03:17.898 --> 03:20.632
You were in the
country all weekend?

03:20.634 --> 03:23.435
I-I had to get
the roof fixed.

03:28.509 --> 03:33.378
Who cares if the roof
was leaking?

03:33.380 --> 03:35.881
Mr. Ryder?

03:38.352 --> 03:41.520
Mr. Ryder?

03:41.522 --> 03:43.922
Do you know
what your wife

03:43.924 --> 03:46.525
would have been doing
tonight?

03:46.527 --> 03:50.462
I talked to her this morning.

03:50.464 --> 03:53.298
She and I talked,

03:53.300 --> 03:57.302
and she said
she might go to the movies,

03:57.304 --> 04:00.672
and I told her not to walk.

04:00.674 --> 04:02.407
The movie,

04:02.409 --> 04:04.376
Mr. Ryder--

04:04.378 --> 04:07.446
would you know which one
that would be?

04:07.448 --> 04:09.715
She likes the 69th Street Twin.

04:09.717 --> 04:11.750
Mr. Ryder, do you
happen to have

04:11.752 --> 04:14.386
a photo of her
that we could borrow?

04:14.388 --> 04:16.788
Daddy...

04:17.858 --> 04:20.759
Daddy, is something wrong?

04:25.499 --> 04:27.799
Where's Mommy?

04:30.437 --> 04:33.739
MAN:
<i> Scandinavian film festival?</i>

04:33.741 --> 04:35.607
People committing suicide
in the snow.

04:35.609 --> 04:38.744
Not exactly what New Yorkers
want to see in the winter.

04:38.746 --> 04:41.546
We sold 86 tickets.

04:41.548 --> 04:43.849
One to her?

04:43.851 --> 04:49.354
I'm so bored I'm working
with my eyes closed.

04:49.356 --> 04:51.423
Okay, thanks.

04:54.428 --> 04:57.429
Six more bars,
four Korean fruit stands.

04:57.431 --> 04:58.830
Nobody saw her.

04:58.832 --> 05:00.432
What's he got?

05:00.434 --> 05:02.367
Suicide.

05:02.369 --> 05:04.369
In Swedish.

05:04.371 --> 05:06.872
DOCTOR:
<i> Massive blunt-force trauma--</i>

05:06.874 --> 05:09.641
matches the other victims--
this guy is batting a thousand.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.877
She ate an hour before
she died-- meat, huh?

05:11.879 --> 05:13.512
Maybe she found
an art house

05:13.514 --> 05:15.480
that served carpaccio
with her cappuccino.

05:15.482 --> 05:17.749
Hey, you find semen
in the vagina, you
don't call us?

05:17.751 --> 05:20.419
Nobody said it was rape--
there's no sign of rape:

05:20.421 --> 05:21.920
no tearing, no abrasions...

05:21.922 --> 05:23.655
Her husband was out of town.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.390
to know that?
I'm supposed

05:25.392 --> 05:27.459
What am I, his travel agent?

05:27.460 --> 05:29.527
What time
did she do it?
Before midnight last night--

05:29.530 --> 05:32.147
sperm cells were dead
this morning.

05:32.148 --> 05:34.765
And after midnight Friday--
I found acid phosphatase,
seminal fluid.

05:34.768 --> 05:37.469
Disappears 48 hours
after intercourse.

05:37.471 --> 05:40.505
Of course, it's also found
in cauliflower juice.

05:40.507 --> 05:44.443
Oh, I think we can
rule out a cauliflower.

05:44.445 --> 05:45.811
Your friend Saperstein
from the three-six?

05:45.813 --> 05:48.613
Jewelry from one
of the other murders

05:48.615 --> 05:51.883
turned up in the diamond
district-- not traceable.

05:51.885 --> 05:55.787
Why does she go to a late movie
with two little kids at home?

05:55.789 --> 05:57.656
Maybe because she<i> had</i>
two little kids at home.

05:57.658 --> 05:58.790
And because she has
a housekeeper.

05:58.792 --> 06:01.493
She's not going
to tell the housekeeper

06:01.495 --> 06:02.861
where she's going?

06:02.863 --> 06:04.529
She had dinner,
she had sex.

06:04.531 --> 06:05.764
Spells boyfriend.

06:05.766 --> 06:07.532
Maybe a lovers' quarrel?

06:07.534 --> 06:09.968
Or the husband wasn't gone
for four days.

06:09.970 --> 06:12.871
Well, it would be nice to know
who she was sleeping with.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.806
You're gonna have
to go see the husband.

06:14.808 --> 06:16.808
Boy, if it wasn't him

06:16.810 --> 06:21.046
this is a lousy time
to bring him that kind of news.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.981
My son's under sedation.

06:22.983 --> 06:24.816
This is not a good time.

06:24.818 --> 06:27.552
We really do have
to talk to him.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.988
The children, the
funeral arrangements...

06:29.990 --> 06:31.857
he's very upset.

06:31.859 --> 06:33.592
Mr. Ryder,
sorry to bother you.

06:33.594 --> 06:35.761
If we could just
have a minute privately.

06:35.763 --> 06:38.530
The family
is in this together.

06:38.532 --> 06:41.500
CERRETA:
I really
don't think...

06:41.502 --> 06:43.502
No.

06:43.504 --> 06:45.470
We'll talk.

06:45.472 --> 06:47.873
Your wife--
there's medical evidence

06:47.875 --> 06:50.509
that indicates that she had
intimate relations

06:50.511 --> 06:52.677
in the 48 hours
before she died.

06:52.679 --> 06:55.046
Well, that's impossible.
Um...

06:55.048 --> 06:58.583
I went to Southampton
on Thursday.

06:58.585 --> 07:01.920
Well, if it wasn't you...

07:01.922 --> 07:04.055
What are you saying?

07:04.057 --> 07:07.526
My wife was having an affair?

07:07.528 --> 07:09.494
I'm sure Lois

07:09.496 --> 07:11.863
was doing no such thing.

07:11.865 --> 07:13.031
If we could track
her movements

07:13.033 --> 07:15.567
we might find a witness
to her murder.

07:15.569 --> 07:17.135
It can't be.

07:17.137 --> 07:20.071
I know my wife.
It's possible
the lab was wrong.

07:20.073 --> 07:23.008
If you would just
take a blood test,
we'd know it's you,

07:23.010 --> 07:25.510
We don't have to look for
someone that doesn't exist.

07:25.512 --> 07:27.045
My daughter-in-law
is dead,

07:27.047 --> 07:29.714
my grandchildren
don't have a mother,

07:29.716 --> 07:33.585
and you want to drag my son
through some cheap scandal.

07:36.023 --> 07:38.790
I don't think so. No.

07:38.792 --> 07:41.159
LOGAN:
<i> So, you tell me,</i>
<i> what's the big deal</i>

07:41.161 --> 07:42.761
about taking
a blood test?

07:42.763 --> 07:44.029
Your wife just died.

07:44.031 --> 07:45.897
Maybe you don't
like being asked

07:45.899 --> 07:48.133
to prove that she
wasn't sleeping around.

07:48.135 --> 07:50.836
Maybe he didn't want us to know
he saw her over the weekend.

07:50.838 --> 07:52.571
Your guy Ryder--
draft bait Vietnam.

07:52.573 --> 07:54.573
Joined the National Guard,
Dan Quayle Brigade.

07:54.575 --> 07:56.575
The army found
his DD-214.

07:56.577 --> 07:57.776
Blood type "A."

07:57.778 --> 07:59.578
Doesn't match the semen.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.713
So why won't he take the test?

08:01.715 --> 08:04.333
Like I said--

08:04.334 --> 08:06.952
grieving husband, privacy,
maybe he just don't like cops.

08:06.954 --> 08:08.753
wouldn't match.
Maybe he knew it

08:08.755 --> 08:10.789
Didn't want us to know
she had a boyfriend

08:10.791 --> 08:12.123
and that he had a motive.

08:12.125 --> 08:14.793
I'll tell you one person
who saw her before she died--

08:14.795 --> 08:16.761
the boyfriend.

08:16.763 --> 08:18.063
Where do you have her last?

08:18.065 --> 08:20.799
The housekeeper says
the hospital--

08:20.801 --> 08:22.868
Carnegie Hill,
volunteer work.

08:22.870 --> 08:24.703
What are you waiting for?

08:24.705 --> 08:27.105
I need people
to hold patients' hands.

08:27.107 --> 08:30.075
Most volunteers, they want
to work the resale shop

08:30.077 --> 08:32.944
on Madison--
first dibs on the used Adolfos.

08:32.946 --> 08:35.113
So you didn't know
Mrs. Ryder well?

08:35.115 --> 08:36.848
Ryder money built
this hospital.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.650
Lois should've been part
of that crowd,

08:38.652 --> 08:40.051
but she didn't understand
the game.

08:40.053 --> 08:42.821
Worked the pediatric
cancer ward.

08:42.823 --> 08:46.024
Did she ever tell you
about her life?

08:46.026 --> 08:48.760
LOGAN:
We think she had

08:48.762 --> 08:50.195
a boyfriend.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.765
I wouldn't know.

08:53.767 --> 08:56.034
CERRETA:
Miss Phillips...

08:56.036 --> 08:58.837
you can either tell<i> us</i>
or a grand jury.

08:58.839 --> 08:59.971
He's married.

08:59.973 --> 09:01.106
He has kids.

09:01.108 --> 09:02.908
Leave him out of it.

09:02.910 --> 09:04.175
He's already in it.

09:04.177 --> 09:06.177
What's his name?

09:09.149 --> 09:12.684
Joel Friedman,
chief of pediatrics.

09:15.756 --> 09:17.122
Lois Ryder.

09:17.124 --> 09:19.124
Of course I knew her.

09:19.126 --> 09:22.027
She volunteered
at the hospital.

09:22.029 --> 09:24.896
Were you with her
Sunday night?

09:24.898 --> 09:27.766
I don't know
what you're talking about.

09:27.768 --> 09:29.968
We'll make it easy
for you.

09:29.970 --> 09:32.137
Sunday night,
Lois Ryder,

09:32.139 --> 09:34.773
you, together.

09:34.775 --> 09:38.743
Do you want us
to tell you
your rights?

09:38.745 --> 09:40.812
Who is it, honey?

09:43.016 --> 09:45.150
Uh, I'll get my coat.

09:45.152 --> 09:48.219
CERRETA:
<i> We want a blood test.</i>

09:48.221 --> 09:51.056
And if you're not going
to give it to us

09:51.058 --> 09:52.924
we'll get a court order.
Relax, gentlemen.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.993
Joel.

10:00.767 --> 10:04.035
I was with her.

10:04.037 --> 10:07.072
We'd been seeing
each other

10:07.074 --> 10:09.774
about five months.

10:09.776 --> 10:12.043
Normally, I...

10:12.045 --> 10:14.779
I wouldn't see her
at my apartment.

10:14.781 --> 10:16.281
She called.

10:16.283 --> 10:18.049
She wanted to talk.

10:18.051 --> 10:19.985
CERRETA:
Her husband says

10:19.987 --> 10:22.053
they were happily married.

10:22.055 --> 10:24.322
Really?

10:29.062 --> 10:31.162
No.

10:31.164 --> 10:34.933
No. There's a picture
in the Ryder house.

10:34.935 --> 10:37.902
Lois told me.

10:37.904 --> 10:41.172
His grandmother on a camel,
Egypt, 1930.

10:41.174 --> 10:44.075
In 1930, her grandmother
was scrubbing floors

10:44.077 --> 10:46.211
in East Orange, New Jersey,

10:46.213 --> 10:50.815
and the Ryders
never let her forget that.

10:50.817 --> 10:53.118
I can't be involved in this.

10:53.120 --> 10:57.022
Did her husband know
about the affair?

10:59.993 --> 11:04.029
I saw him last month
at a hospital fund-raiser.

11:04.031 --> 11:06.031
He smirked at me.

11:06.033 --> 11:07.832
He knew.

11:10.137 --> 11:14.272
Lois didn't understand
what she was doing.

11:14.274 --> 11:17.042
I did.

11:17.044 --> 11:20.045
I was there
to make him jealous.

11:20.047 --> 11:21.179
He's cooperating.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.214
He didn't kill her.

11:23.216 --> 11:26.051
I know it.
You know it.

11:33.894 --> 11:35.026
She's using him.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.895
Maybe he loses
his temper.

11:36.896 --> 11:38.763
The elevator man says
the doc's wife got home

11:38.765 --> 11:40.131
40 minutes after
Lois Ryder left.

11:40.133 --> 11:42.133
He was waiting
at the door for her.

11:42.135 --> 11:43.802
That gives him just
about enough time.

11:43.804 --> 11:45.270
Fire escape dumps
into a locked yard,

11:45.272 --> 11:47.806
there's a tall fence--
so the doc goes out,

11:47.808 --> 11:49.274
climbs the fence,
clobbers Lois Ryder,

11:49.276 --> 11:52.243
hauls her body from the west
side to the east side

11:52.245 --> 11:55.146
and gets home just in time
to kiss his wife hello?

11:55.148 --> 11:58.149
What is he, Houdini?
Yeah.

11:58.151 --> 12:02.120
The doc here says that
Ryder knew about him

12:02.122 --> 12:05.223
and Ryder said
he<i> didn't</i> know.

12:08.028 --> 12:09.260
I knew.

12:11.164 --> 12:17.102
I just didn't see why the rest
of the world had to know.

12:17.104 --> 12:19.638
<i> We</i> had to know.

12:19.639 --> 12:22.173
He was one of the last
people to see her alive.

12:22.175 --> 12:23.975
My granddaughter--

12:23.977 --> 12:26.177
should she read
in the newspaper

12:26.179 --> 12:28.179
about her mother's
infidelity?

12:28.181 --> 12:30.949
And especially
with someone so foreign.

12:30.951 --> 12:33.218
Yes. He's from the west side.

12:33.220 --> 12:36.221
You know what I mean--
he was not of our element.

12:36.223 --> 12:40.091
No Jewish doctors
in your crowd, huh?

12:40.093 --> 12:42.060
LOGAN:
Mr. Ryder, let me

12:42.062 --> 12:43.995
ask you something.

12:43.997 --> 12:45.864
Your wife's affair--

12:45.866 --> 12:48.333
you didn't have a problem
with it?

12:48.335 --> 12:52.003
Look, this thing
with Dr. Friedman--

12:52.005 --> 12:54.472
my wife and I discussed it.

12:54.474 --> 12:56.207
It was ending...

12:56.209 --> 12:58.476
and frankly,
i don't think

12:58.478 --> 13:01.246
he was very happy about it.

13:04.351 --> 13:06.217
First, Ryder sends us
to the movies

13:06.219 --> 13:08.086
but his wife
didn't go to the movies.

13:08.088 --> 13:10.221
Then he points
at the doctor.
It's all crap,

13:10.223 --> 13:12.435
and it's all coming
from Ryder.

13:12.436 --> 13:14.648
So maybe he came into town early
and surprised the wife.

13:14.649 --> 13:16.861
Give us six guys, and
this time we canvass with
Ryder's photograph.

13:16.863 --> 13:19.230
Six guys-- why don't I just hire
the Russian army?

13:19.232 --> 13:21.466
They're not busy.
Don, first we do the
doc's neighborhood,

13:21.468 --> 13:23.101
then we do Ryder's
neighborhood,

13:23.103 --> 13:24.969
and then we do where
she was found.

13:24.971 --> 13:29.140
Just give us
Profaci and Li.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.109
One shift.

13:34.981 --> 13:37.148
(<i> car horns honk</i> )

13:37.150 --> 13:41.152
I got a guy saw Ryder
driving a newsdelivery truck.

13:41.154 --> 13:43.054
Now, it was either Ryder

13:43.056 --> 13:46.157
or it was a black guy
looked exactly like him.

13:46.159 --> 13:50.061
I got a guy saw a U.F.O.
Pick up Li.

13:50.063 --> 13:52.430
Go home and say hello
to Shirley for me,

13:52.432 --> 13:53.898
all right, Profaci?

13:53.900 --> 13:55.133
I'll see you, Phil.
Yeah.

13:55.135 --> 13:57.936
LOGAN:
Phil! Phil!

13:59.139 --> 14:02.140
I love New York
this time of year.

14:02.142 --> 14:05.143
What, do you got somebody
who saw him the night
she was hit?

14:05.145 --> 14:08.079
Not quite.
Come meet Mr. Lewis.

14:08.081 --> 14:09.414
Nice-looking lady.

14:09.416 --> 14:12.283
For me, a little old,
but great cheekbones.

14:12.285 --> 14:14.152
Tell him about the boys.

14:14.154 --> 14:17.155
Couple of weeks ago, two kids,
they're renting porn--

14:17.157 --> 14:20.191
<i>Vibrating Vixens.</i>
There ought to be a law.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.292
There<i> is</i> a law.

14:21.294 --> 14:22.493
Anyway, they're talking

14:22.495 --> 14:25.463
about the baseball bat guy,
the mugger.

14:25.465 --> 14:27.298
she comes in all the time.
The lady with the cheekbones,

14:27.300 --> 14:28.466
Art movies.

14:28.468 --> 14:30.301
Mrs. Ryder.
The one
in the picture.

14:30.303 --> 14:33.438
She gets upset,
she turns to the guy with her...

14:33.440 --> 14:34.505
Mr. Ryder.

14:34.507 --> 14:36.040
She's all riled up.

14:36.042 --> 14:37.442
"What's wrong with society?"

14:37.444 --> 14:38.576
"Life is unfair."

14:38.578 --> 14:40.311
"No wonder they mug people."

14:40.313 --> 14:42.580
He says, "Can we finish
the speech when we get home?"

14:42.582 --> 14:44.949
Me, I say they ought
to get shot.

14:44.951 --> 14:48.019
Ryder knew
about the mugger.

14:48.021 --> 14:50.188
Thanks a lot.

14:50.190 --> 14:53.057
Now we know why he didn't want
to take the blood test.

14:53.059 --> 14:55.193
He didn't want us
to look for the boyfriend.

14:55.195 --> 14:57.996
We find the boyfriend,
we find out Ryder
knew who he was.

14:57.998 --> 15:01.165
He knows who he is,
he knows where to look
for his wife.

15:01.167 --> 15:03.067
He waits outside
the doc's apartment.

15:03.069 --> 15:06.170
That's Riverside Drive,
11:00, nobody on the street.
Cracks her skull.

15:06.172 --> 15:09.107
Brings her over here
across town, dumps her
in<i> this</i> neighborhood.

15:09.109 --> 15:12.110
Copycatting the mugger.
And then figures we
drop it right here.

15:12.112 --> 15:14.479
One more mugger victim--
too bad. Case closed.

15:14.481 --> 15:17.448
My ass-- case open.

15:19.986 --> 15:21.452
1:00 A.M., he pulls in.

15:21.454 --> 15:23.521
Yeah, you know,
I just come on.

15:23.522 --> 15:25.589
Ryder says he came
straight from Southampton--
nothing says he didn't.

15:25.592 --> 15:28.092
"Traffic on a southern state,"
he said. Like I care.

15:28.094 --> 15:29.560
Not your favorite customer, huh?

15:29.562 --> 15:31.996
I get in, I want
to park the car--
he's yakking.

15:31.998 --> 15:33.531
His rent-a-place
in the islands--

15:33.533 --> 15:36.234
the roof's broken,
the pool's too hot.

15:36.236 --> 15:39.170
In the winter, I'm lucky
if I get to Park Avenue South.

15:39.172 --> 15:41.139
Mr. Ryder--
is he always so cordial?

15:41.141 --> 15:43.641
I got to just sit
in the cold car and listen.

15:43.643 --> 15:44.642
Cold?

15:44.644 --> 15:45.944
The car was cold?

15:45.946 --> 15:47.211
It was freezing.

15:47.213 --> 15:48.646
Thanks a lot.

15:48.648 --> 15:50.581
What is it to Southampton,
two hours?

15:50.583 --> 15:53.151
I go six blocks in my car,
and it overheats.

15:53.153 --> 15:56.154
He hit his wife,
then he went and sat
in some coffee shop

15:56.156 --> 15:58.556
a couple of hours till
the shift changed here.

15:58.558 --> 16:00.525
You want to canvass
10,000 coffee shops?

16:00.527 --> 16:02.660
I want to get
in that damn car.

16:02.662 --> 16:05.563
Only if we impound the
car, Ryder's gonna know
we're sniffing around.

16:05.565 --> 16:07.131
I'm gonna dance
for the warrant.

16:07.133 --> 16:08.633
They can do it here.

16:12.605 --> 16:14.105
No blood in the car.

16:14.107 --> 16:15.707
Must have bagged her head.

16:15.709 --> 16:18.209
But C.S.U. tweezers
picked up fibers

16:18.211 --> 16:19.744
from Mrs. Ryder's sweater.

16:19.746 --> 16:21.579
Yeah, but where's
that gonna get us?

16:21.581 --> 16:23.014
Even $800 cashmere sheds.

16:23.016 --> 16:24.666
It's her car.

16:24.667 --> 16:26.317
There's bound to be fibers
from her clothes.

16:26.319 --> 16:29.020
In the trunk?

16:29.022 --> 16:30.254
Paul, I can guarantee it.

16:30.256 --> 16:31.889
He waits outside
Friedman's apartment.

16:31.890 --> 16:33.523
He hits her, he drags
the body across town,

16:33.526 --> 16:35.760
he dumps it, he makes it
look like a mugging,

16:35.762 --> 16:38.029
he tells us she was
down at the movies.

16:38.031 --> 16:39.731
It's a good story.
No evidence.

16:39.733 --> 16:42.033
We can barely convict
Ryder of lying.
What about the fiber?

16:42.035 --> 16:43.668
It could have been there
for months.

16:43.670 --> 16:44.669
The car was cold.

16:44.671 --> 16:45.737
It wasn't bloody.

16:45.739 --> 16:47.472
want us to do?
Paul, what do you

16:47.473 --> 16:49.206
Hit every sporting goods store
in the five boroughs,

16:49.209 --> 16:51.509
find a clerk who sold
a middle-aged man a bat?

16:51.511 --> 16:52.777
Hey, hey, hey,
last time I looked

16:52.779 --> 16:55.613
we all got our paychecks
from the same place.

16:55.615 --> 16:57.315
He is not the enemy.

16:57.317 --> 16:59.617
Give us something.
Like motive.
Well, there's the affair,

16:59.619 --> 17:03.221
but the doc says that Ryder
didn't even care about it.
Ryder?

17:03.223 --> 17:04.655
I guarantee he cared
that his wife's lover

17:04.657 --> 17:06.724
was Jewish.
Oh, come on,

17:06.725 --> 17:08.792
who cares about the religion
of the guy your wife is boffing?

17:08.795 --> 17:10.561
The Ryders.

17:10.563 --> 17:11.629
You heard what she said.

17:11.631 --> 17:13.798
"Not in our element."

17:13.800 --> 17:15.666
An affair--
is that motive?

17:15.668 --> 17:18.236
What was going on
in the marriage?

17:18.238 --> 17:20.171
She must have told somebody.

17:20.173 --> 17:22.673
Let's get photostats
of her datebook.

17:24.144 --> 17:28.079
K. Drinks, the Algonquin.

17:31.818 --> 17:35.386
Kent, lunch.

17:35.388 --> 17:37.388
K. Meeker.

17:37.390 --> 17:39.257
Dinner.

17:39.259 --> 17:40.658
Lutece.

17:43.063 --> 17:45.296
Kent, lunch.

17:45.298 --> 17:47.598
Le Perigord.

17:48.735 --> 17:51.803
What do we got,
another boyfriend?

17:51.805 --> 17:53.771
Lois and I?

17:53.773 --> 17:56.240
No. Just friends.

17:56.242 --> 17:58.376
Are you friends
with Mr. Ryder?

17:58.378 --> 18:01.612
Prep school. We were
on the swimming team,
St. Luke's.

18:01.614 --> 18:03.147
I'm almost family.

18:03.149 --> 18:04.649
How about Mrs. Ryder?

18:04.651 --> 18:07.285
Is she<i> almost</i>
family, too?

18:07.287 --> 18:11.155
Lois was killed by a mugger,
isn't that right?

18:11.157 --> 18:13.691
This time that you spent
with Mrs. Ryder...

18:13.693 --> 18:15.593
She came to me because...

18:15.595 --> 18:19.097
Let's say my pedigree
was marginally better than hers.

18:19.099 --> 18:21.165
She needed advice--
her marriage.

18:21.167 --> 18:22.700
What's wrong with it?

18:22.702 --> 18:24.435
Lois figured it went bad

18:24.437 --> 18:26.637
when Jonathan's mother
left the wedding reception

18:26.639 --> 18:27.738
before the florist did.

18:27.740 --> 18:29.440
My mother doesn't like my wife.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.676
I stopped worrying
about that 20 years ago.

18:31.678 --> 18:34.345
<i>You</i> are not
Jonathan Ryder.

18:34.347 --> 18:37.348
You know,
when we were in prep school

18:37.350 --> 18:39.183
he wasn't doing well.

18:39.185 --> 18:40.651
His mother comes up.

18:40.653 --> 18:42.720
There's a new
Ryder building.

18:42.722 --> 18:44.455
Suddenly his grades are fine.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.324
She never let him
forget that.

18:46.326 --> 18:47.425
That he was a screw-up?

18:47.427 --> 18:48.693
Takes its toll.

18:48.695 --> 18:51.229
He once booted the cat
across the room.

18:51.231 --> 18:52.430
Did he ever boot his wife?

18:52.432 --> 18:53.865
Worse.

18:53.867 --> 18:58.436
Lois told me he offered her
three million to leave.

18:58.438 --> 19:00.438
Just handed her a paper.

19:00.440 --> 19:03.407
"Hi, honey. Sign this. Go away."

19:03.409 --> 19:05.143
She loved him.

19:05.145 --> 19:08.746
She wanted a marriage counselor.

19:08.748 --> 19:10.915
Yeah, but he could get a divorce
with her or without her.

19:10.917 --> 19:12.817
Her share of joint property--

19:12.819 --> 19:14.285
in the neighborhood

19:14.287 --> 19:15.319
of 20 million.

19:15.321 --> 19:17.655
Unless she just happened to die.

19:17.657 --> 19:18.973
Jonathan?

19:18.974 --> 19:20.290
Doesn't have the giblets.

19:20.293 --> 19:22.226
Mama cut them off years ago.

19:22.228 --> 19:25.663
Maybe you should ask Barbara
Ryder where<i> she</i> was that night.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.782
Ryder should have popped
his mother

19:27.783 --> 19:29.900
and told her where to get off.
You the expert
on lousy moms?

19:29.903 --> 19:33.404
As a matter of fact,
i am.

19:33.406 --> 19:35.373
Mrs. Ryder's
necklace and bracelet

19:35.375 --> 19:37.508
pawned in Chelsea, identified
from insurance company photos.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.710
Who pawned them,
Jonathan Ryder's mother?

19:39.712 --> 19:43.247
Well, I really don't think she
frequents the New Era Pawnshop.

19:43.249 --> 19:45.183
When did that jewelry
come in?

19:45.185 --> 19:47.451
Morning after the murder--
pawn shop got our
flier yesterday.

19:47.453 --> 19:48.920
Are we making this up?

19:48.922 --> 19:50.788
Was she killed by a mugger?

19:50.790 --> 19:53.824
Why don't you find
the guy and ask him?

19:57.764 --> 19:59.764
CLERK:
<i> What's with the muscle?</i>

19:59.766 --> 20:01.933
I saw the circular
and I called.

20:01.935 --> 20:05.236
I'm going to eat the money
I gave that creep.

20:05.238 --> 20:07.438
Since when have you become
so law-abiding?

20:07.440 --> 20:10.541
Since I did one-to-three
for receiving.

20:10.543 --> 20:13.511
My wife likes me home
for the holidays.

20:13.513 --> 20:16.214
Okay, good. Thanks.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.916
Hey. Hey, your Mr. Everett
who pawned the jewelry? Bad I.D.

20:18.918 --> 20:20.851
His license was stolen
three weeks ago.

20:20.853 --> 20:23.421
The law says get an I.D.
I got one.

20:23.423 --> 20:25.790
Oh, yeah? Did you look
at the picture on it?

20:25.792 --> 20:27.458
What color was he?

20:27.460 --> 20:28.526
White.

20:28.528 --> 20:30.561
No. The real Mr. Everett
is black.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.496
You didn't look too good.

20:32.498 --> 20:35.967
Mikey, this guy
laid out $4,000

20:35.969 --> 20:38.236
on a fake I.D.--
what do you think?

20:38.238 --> 20:40.271
I think he's probably got
other stolen stuff here.

20:40.273 --> 20:41.739
I think I should open
the safe.

20:41.741 --> 20:45.309
He had a wild look.
Th... This guy is crazy.

20:45.311 --> 20:46.477
He could kill me.

20:46.479 --> 20:48.446
I don't want trouble.

20:48.448 --> 20:50.348
From him or from us?

20:50.350 --> 20:52.316
Who's it going to be?

20:52.318 --> 20:53.918
Give me the name.

20:57.457 --> 21:01.792
I guess the middle class really
is moving out of New York.

21:01.794 --> 21:03.561
Fourteen.

21:08.501 --> 21:10.501
(<i> knocking</i> )

21:10.503 --> 21:11.936
Henry Willard?

21:11.938 --> 21:14.005
New York City Police!

21:15.508 --> 21:17.375
Go to it, big guy.

21:19.912 --> 21:21.579
(<i> man yelling</i> )

21:28.921 --> 21:30.855
No.

21:33.459 --> 21:34.925
Tough guy, huh?

21:34.927 --> 21:38.462
Guess we interrupted
his recreation.

21:38.464 --> 21:41.365
MAN:
Come on, get out of here.

21:41.367 --> 21:42.533
Henry. Henry.

21:42.535 --> 21:44.035
Your driver's license.

21:44.037 --> 21:46.070
Your I.D.
at the pawnshop, Henry?

21:46.072 --> 21:48.039
You mugged a guy
to get them.

21:48.041 --> 21:49.573
Not to mention,
mugging the lady.

21:49.575 --> 21:51.042
She's in pretty bad shape.

21:51.044 --> 21:53.377
You better hope
she can't identify you.

21:53.379 --> 21:54.945
I found that
stuff, man.

21:54.947 --> 21:56.647
On Mrs. Ryder.

21:56.648 --> 21:58.348
In a Dumpster,
Penn Station somewhere.

21:58.351 --> 22:00.451
Middle of the night,
I was high, I don't remember.

22:00.453 --> 22:02.520
You're a real specimen, Henry--

22:02.522 --> 22:04.522
stupid, drugged, and violent.

22:06.426 --> 22:07.992
Thanks.

22:07.994 --> 22:09.994
Okay, Henry.

22:09.996 --> 22:13.998
These are the insurance photos
of the jewelry.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.433
Pay attention!

22:15.435 --> 22:17.902
This is the bracelet.

22:17.904 --> 22:20.438
This is the necklace.

22:20.440 --> 22:22.606
This is the pin.

22:22.608 --> 22:23.974
Over here!

22:23.976 --> 22:25.509
Where's this pin?

22:25.511 --> 22:27.645
There was no damn pin.

22:27.647 --> 22:29.013
Henry,

22:29.015 --> 22:31.082
don't you want us
to tell the D.A.

22:31.084 --> 22:32.416
that you cooperated?
Huh? Huh?

22:32.418 --> 22:35.019
Get me a lawyer.

22:36.089 --> 22:38.055
Mr. Willard's yellow sheets.

22:38.057 --> 22:39.957
B and E,
mugging, crack.

22:39.959 --> 22:42.493
He mugs for jewelry,
sells it for drugs.

22:42.495 --> 22:43.594
I got a problem.

22:43.596 --> 22:44.995
The guy's a wacko.

22:44.997 --> 22:46.530
He swung a table at us.

22:46.532 --> 22:48.366
I don't see the
problem. Book him.

22:48.368 --> 22:49.600
A table,
not a baseball bat.

22:49.602 --> 22:52.470
There wasn't a bat
in the room.

22:52.472 --> 22:55.573
What's, he gonna buy a new bat
every time he mugs someone?
Listen to this.

22:55.575 --> 22:59.076
Bracelet, diamonds,
made by Harry Winston, 1979.

22:59.078 --> 23:00.511
Appraised 18 grand.

23:00.513 --> 23:04.081
Necklace, diamonds
and rubies, 30 G's.

23:04.083 --> 23:05.983
Harry Winston, 1985.

23:05.985 --> 23:10.454
Pin, silver. A thousand bucks,
Lucien Peller, 1931.

23:10.456 --> 23:12.890
Yeah?
Well, suppose Mr. Congeniality
in there

23:12.892 --> 23:15.009
is telling us the truth.

23:15.010 --> 23:17.127
He found the expensive necklace
and bracelet in the Dumpster

23:17.130 --> 23:18.963
but not
the thousand-dollar pin.

23:18.965 --> 23:21.132
Ryder. He threw
the new stuff away.

23:21.134 --> 23:22.533
It was only money.

23:22.535 --> 23:24.535
The pin was an heirloom.

23:24.537 --> 23:27.705
You telling me he killed her,
then started feeling

23:27.707 --> 23:29.473
a little sentimental,
kept the pin?

23:29.475 --> 23:30.975
The city house

23:30.977 --> 23:32.510
the country house,
<i>and</i> the mother's house.

23:32.512 --> 23:34.478
This time<i> you</i> dance
for the warrant.

23:41.754 --> 23:44.722
Tennis rackets, skis,
polo mallets, and...

23:44.724 --> 23:46.157
What is this?

23:46.159 --> 23:47.191
A lacrosse stick.

23:47.193 --> 23:49.660
My son hasn't played
in years.

23:51.164 --> 23:53.464
You mind if I use
your phone again?

23:53.466 --> 23:54.598
Not at all.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.033
No baseball bats.

23:56.035 --> 23:58.602
You should wait
for my attorney.

23:58.604 --> 23:59.937
Yes, ma'am.

23:59.939 --> 24:02.206
The law says
we don't have to.

24:02.208 --> 24:04.642
Get me Detective Li, please.
Thanks.

24:04.644 --> 24:06.210
Hey. Logan.

24:06.212 --> 24:08.579
You find anything?

24:08.581 --> 24:10.981
Oh. Thanks.

24:10.983 --> 24:13.117
Nothing
on the other side of town.

24:13.119 --> 24:15.186
Ryder says
they wrinkled his suits.

24:15.188 --> 24:16.220
Yeah?

24:16.222 --> 24:18.489
Well, he may not
be wearing them

24:18.491 --> 24:19.957
for a while.

24:19.959 --> 24:23.027
Pin, silver, 1931.

24:33.573 --> 24:35.706
Docket number 5231.

24:35.708 --> 24:37.708
<i>The people v. Jonathan Ryder.</i>

24:37.710 --> 24:39.910
The charge is murder
in the second degree.

24:39.912 --> 24:41.745
How does the defendant plead?

24:41.747 --> 24:43.547
Not guilty.

24:43.549 --> 24:45.549
The people seek
substantial bail, Your Honor.

24:45.551 --> 24:47.117
The charge is murder.

24:47.119 --> 24:49.053
So I heard, Mr. Robinette.

24:49.055 --> 24:50.721
Mr. Webber?

24:50.723 --> 24:52.690
Your Honor, Mr. Ryder is
a well-established...

24:52.692 --> 24:53.757
i know who he is.

24:53.759 --> 24:54.925
500,000.

24:54.927 --> 24:56.660
He can afford it.

24:56.662 --> 24:58.696
Usual travel restrictions.

24:58.698 --> 25:00.831
(<i> gavel bangs</i> )

25:03.603 --> 25:07.004
Paul, Mr. Ryder's mother,
his sister--

25:07.006 --> 25:10.841
they were all playing bridge
the night of the murder.

25:10.843 --> 25:11.909
Alibi witnesses.

25:11.911 --> 25:13.878
Bridge? Three of them?

25:13.880 --> 25:17.648
I believe a computer
made up the fourth hand.

25:17.650 --> 25:19.850
Is the computer
going to testify, too?

25:19.852 --> 25:22.820
Well, who do you
and Stone have?

25:22.822 --> 25:25.990
The Mormon Tabernacle Choir?

25:25.992 --> 25:27.691
Anything to avoid it.

25:27.693 --> 25:29.960
I don't want to testify.

25:29.962 --> 25:33.097
A murder trial
isn't a matter

25:33.099 --> 25:34.832
of personal convenience.

25:34.834 --> 25:38.102
My daughter comes home
at 3:00 in the morning.

25:38.104 --> 25:42.072
My son wants to know
why his mother won't talk to me.

25:42.074 --> 25:44.808
They'll turn my life
into tabloid headlines.

25:44.810 --> 25:46.810
What do you need me for?

25:46.812 --> 25:49.880
Your affair,
Mr. Ryder's awareness of it,

25:49.882 --> 25:53.083
what time Mrs. Ryder
left your apartment.

25:53.085 --> 25:55.853
I don't know anything
about the murder.

25:55.855 --> 25:57.855
If you cared for Mrs. Ryder...

25:57.857 --> 26:00.891
I loved her.

26:00.893 --> 26:03.627
I wanted to marry her.

26:03.629 --> 26:04.995
My kids...

26:04.997 --> 26:06.997
I couldn't leave my wife.

26:06.999 --> 26:09.066
She wouldn't survive.

26:09.068 --> 26:12.202
I'm on the board
of six Jewish charities.

26:12.204 --> 26:17.207
I... I know that sounds stupid,
but...

26:17.209 --> 26:19.577
that's my life.

26:19.579 --> 26:23.180
If you don't testify,
I'll cite you for contempt.

26:25.084 --> 26:28.085
I can't bring her back.

26:28.087 --> 26:31.221
I want to salvage
what's left of my life.

26:31.223 --> 26:33.090
Cite me for contempt.

26:33.092 --> 26:34.959
I'll pay the fine.

26:34.961 --> 26:38.228
My lawyer said
you won't put me in jail.

26:43.836 --> 26:45.903
BARBARA:
<i> Mr. Robinette,</i>

26:45.905 --> 26:49.073
we thought it would be
more convenient for you

26:49.075 --> 26:50.741
if you saw us together.

26:50.743 --> 26:53.744
Your lawyer said you wouldn't
see me any other way.

26:53.746 --> 26:55.179
Oh, there must be
some misunderstanding.

26:55.181 --> 26:57.848
I hope we can dispose
of this situation.

26:57.850 --> 27:00.017
Why don't we sit down.

27:00.019 --> 27:04.221
We left Jonathan's house
just after 11:00.

27:04.223 --> 27:06.256
Did you notice the time, too,
Mrs. Dickey?

27:06.258 --> 27:08.158
Jane never wears a watch.

27:08.160 --> 27:10.894
I've tried to convince her
for years.

27:10.896 --> 27:13.664
You left your brother's house

27:13.666 --> 27:14.932
with your mother.

27:14.934 --> 27:17.768
Jane's staying with me
in the country.

27:17.770 --> 27:20.904
We were so sorry
to hear about Lois.

27:20.906 --> 27:22.740
BARBARA:
May I be frank,

27:22.742 --> 27:25.109
Mr. Robinette?

27:25.111 --> 27:27.144
I'm very worried about my son,

27:27.146 --> 27:30.881
as I'm sure your mother
would worry about you.

27:30.883 --> 27:34.018
Jonathan's been accused
of a horrible crime.

27:34.020 --> 27:37.921
I spoke with him this morning.

27:37.923 --> 27:40.090
He hasn't left his house
in days.

27:40.092 --> 27:42.760
JANE:
Now that you have our statement

27:42.762 --> 27:45.062
you'll drop the charges,
won't you?

27:45.064 --> 27:47.197
We are certain it was 11:00.

27:47.199 --> 27:51.168
My late husband
insisted I be punctual.

27:51.170 --> 27:55.139
I always know the time.

27:55.141 --> 27:58.042
Think they'll hold up
on the stand?
Paul says

27:58.044 --> 28:00.678
the sister's just like Ryder,
under his mama's thumb.

28:00.680 --> 28:03.981
She's convinced her daughter
to commit perjury.

28:03.983 --> 28:06.717
She drove her son
to kill his wife.

28:06.719 --> 28:08.752
The paper Ryder asked
his wife to sign?

28:08.754 --> 28:11.255
You wonder why she didn't take
the three million to walk?

28:11.257 --> 28:12.690
Paragraph seven.

28:12.692 --> 28:15.192
He wanted her
to give up the kids?

28:15.194 --> 28:18.062
Sure. To them,
the mother is disposable.

28:18.064 --> 28:19.296
The children are Ryders.

28:19.298 --> 28:22.032
She went, they stayed.
Lovely.

28:22.034 --> 28:24.034
Why didn't Ryder burn this?

28:24.036 --> 28:26.904
we were looking for it.
Didn't know

28:26.906 --> 28:29.973
We got it from
his corporate lawyer.
They let you have it?

28:29.975 --> 28:31.308
It's attorney work product.

28:31.310 --> 28:33.110
Ryder wrote that himself.

28:33.112 --> 28:34.812
They can't claim privilege.

28:34.814 --> 28:37.081
Couldn't have got it
from Ryder anyway.
Why not?

28:37.083 --> 28:38.015
You're gonna love this.

28:38.017 --> 28:39.750
His mother said he was home.

28:39.752 --> 28:41.285
They went to serve
a subpoena on him--

28:41.287 --> 28:43.053
not in the city
or Southampton.

28:43.055 --> 28:45.055
The housekeeper gave
me the limo service.

28:45.057 --> 28:47.291
Dropped him and
the kids at J.F.K.

28:47.293 --> 28:48.992
Sun Air terminal.

28:48.994 --> 28:50.160
International.

28:50.162 --> 28:52.730
Ryder has a winter house?

28:52.732 --> 28:54.798
Two. Palm Beach--
where he isn't--
and Barbados.

28:54.800 --> 28:57.968
The bail conditions say
he can't leave the country.

28:57.970 --> 28:59.136
He broke bail.

29:01.173 --> 29:04.975
JUDGE:
<i> It looks to me</i>
<i> like your client</i>

29:04.977 --> 29:06.977
was fleeing this jurisdiction.

29:06.979 --> 29:09.179
Mr. Ryder had no intention
of flight, Your Honor.

29:09.181 --> 29:12.116
He wanted to get his children
away from the press.

29:12.118 --> 29:13.851
I put people in jail

29:13.853 --> 29:16.220
because they don't have
25¢ for bail.

29:16.222 --> 29:18.055
Mr. Ryder thinks the rules

29:18.057 --> 29:20.023
don't apply to him?

29:20.025 --> 29:21.992
I advised him
it was all right.

29:21.994 --> 29:23.160
At worst, a
technical violation.

29:23.162 --> 29:24.361
Bad advice, Counselor.

29:24.363 --> 29:26.130
Very bad advice.

29:26.132 --> 29:30.868
I've got a technical solution
for your technical violation.

29:30.870 --> 29:32.236
Mr. Ryder likes islands?

29:32.238 --> 29:35.172
I've got one for him--
Rikers.

29:35.174 --> 29:36.840
This is ridiculous.

29:36.842 --> 29:37.975
Your Honor...

29:37.977 --> 29:39.109
Bail is revoked.

29:39.111 --> 29:41.145
Ryder in jail for two months?

29:41.147 --> 29:44.882
His idea of a rough weekend
is a picnic with warm champagne.

29:44.884 --> 29:47.885
Do you think he'll start
blabbing to his cell mate?

29:47.887 --> 29:49.186
By the trial,
he'll be a blithering idiot.

29:49.188 --> 29:51.054
So let's put an informant
in the cell.

29:51.056 --> 29:52.823
We'll never survive on appeal.

29:52.825 --> 29:54.024
Sixth Amendment
right to counsel.

29:54.026 --> 29:56.026
The Supreme Court is clear--
if the informant

29:56.028 --> 29:58.896
doesn't elicit anything,
it's admissible.

29:58.898 --> 30:00.430
Who's available to send in?

30:00.432 --> 30:03.100
An armed robber,
a rent-gouging landlord.

30:03.102 --> 30:05.269
Both of those
are ripe for deals.

30:05.271 --> 30:07.037
Go with the armed robber.

30:07.039 --> 30:09.273
Ends up in front of a jury

30:09.275 --> 30:11.375
get more sympathy
than a landlord.

30:11.377 --> 30:13.076
I know what you want.

30:13.078 --> 30:15.112
I'll get it.
You will not
"get it."

30:15.114 --> 30:17.047
You will not ask Mr.
Ryder any questions.

30:17.049 --> 30:19.049
You will not say
"good morning."

30:19.050 --> 30:21.050
And if he tries to confess,
I should break out of the cell?

30:21.053 --> 30:25.055
If you mess this up,
you'll be very sorry
you cut a deal with me.

30:25.057 --> 30:27.958
Ryder<i> mentions</i> his wife,
you avert your eyes,
say nothing.

30:27.960 --> 30:31.328
You don't trust me,
put in a robot with a
tape recorder in his head.

30:31.330 --> 30:34.031
If I could, I would.

30:36.435 --> 30:38.368
<i>Cashmere fibers in the trunk</i>

30:38.370 --> 30:41.038
matched fibers from the sweater
Mrs. Ryder was wearing,

30:41.040 --> 30:42.940
beyond any doubt.

30:42.942 --> 30:45.409
Was the pattern
of the fibers distinctive?

30:45.411 --> 30:48.178
Well, they were spread in a
band about three feet long

30:48.180 --> 30:50.247
and pulled out at the base,

30:50.249 --> 30:53.951
as if they'd been wrapped
around something heavy

30:53.953 --> 30:55.018
and dragged.

30:55.020 --> 30:56.420
Your witness.

31:02.094 --> 31:03.894
Mr. Medill, your report

31:03.896 --> 31:06.129
notes traces
of naphthalene.

31:06.131 --> 31:07.097
What is that?

31:07.099 --> 31:09.366
Dry-cleaning fluid.

31:09.368 --> 31:13.937
This ticket from the Seaview
Cleaners in Southampton

31:13.939 --> 31:16.106
itemizes clothes
removed from storage

31:16.108 --> 31:18.942
two weeks before
Mrs. Ryder died.

31:18.944 --> 31:21.111
Do any of those
listed items

31:21.113 --> 31:24.147
match the type
of fiber you found

31:24.149 --> 31:25.115
in the trunk?

31:27.519 --> 31:30.888
There's a pink cashmere sweater.

31:30.890 --> 31:33.957
This fiber pattern--
could it have been made

31:33.959 --> 31:36.326
by a bundle of clothes
removed from storage

31:36.328 --> 31:37.995
and put in a trunk

31:37.997 --> 31:40.163
with a pink sweater
on the bottom?

31:40.165 --> 31:43.000
Dry cleaners wrap
their clothes in plastic.

31:43.002 --> 31:44.434
And if the plastic ripped?

31:44.436 --> 31:47.204
I suppose so.

31:47.206 --> 31:50.073
You suppose what,
Mr. Medill?

31:50.075 --> 31:53.977
It could be consistent, yes.

31:53.979 --> 31:56.046
Thank you.

31:57.149 --> 31:59.183
And after Mrs. Ryder
left the hospital

31:59.184 --> 32:01.218
do you recall whether she was
wearing any jewelry or not?

32:01.220 --> 32:03.186
There was a pin on her coat.

32:03.188 --> 32:05.255
She wore it all the time.

32:07.393 --> 32:10.060
I'm showing you
people's exhibit #12.

32:10.062 --> 32:11.194
Is this the pin?

32:11.196 --> 32:13.096
That looks like it, yes.

32:13.098 --> 32:15.432
Thank you.
No further questions.

32:19.138 --> 32:21.171
Miss Phillips...

32:21.173 --> 32:25.075
does this resemble
the pin Lois Ryder was wearing?

32:26.312 --> 32:28.111
It's similar.

32:30.082 --> 32:31.381
And this?

32:36.355 --> 32:39.089
Yes, it does.

32:39.091 --> 32:43.026
And the pin
in this photograph?

32:43.028 --> 32:44.194
Your Honor,
objection.

32:44.196 --> 32:45.529
Where did he get these?

32:45.531 --> 32:48.165
Gentlemen.

32:50.502 --> 32:53.270
Excellent question,
Counsellor.

32:53.271 --> 32:56.039
If you had those things produced
to create confusion...

32:56.041 --> 33:00.444
The Ryder family had four
nearly identical pins
made in 1931.

33:00.446 --> 33:02.412
The insurance agent
that identified

33:02.414 --> 33:04.348
the one Lois Ryder
was wearing

33:04.350 --> 33:06.350
made a mistake--
he'll testify to that.

33:06.352 --> 33:09.086
It's a very
convenient mistake.
Well, easy one to make.

33:09.088 --> 33:11.254
How did that pin end up
in Barbara Ryder's house?

33:11.256 --> 33:16.059
She took it to wear to her
daughter-in-law's funeral.

33:16.061 --> 33:17.561
JUDGE:
Mr. Webber,

33:17.563 --> 33:19.496
if you don't back this up,
you're looking

33:19.498 --> 33:23.166
at a character committee
investigation.

33:23.168 --> 33:24.501
Objection overruled.

33:26.372 --> 33:29.473
Now, Miss Phillips,
I ask you again--

33:29.475 --> 33:31.441
are you absolutely certain

33:31.443 --> 33:36.113
which of these pins
Mrs. Ryder was wearing?

33:36.115 --> 33:39.116
I think
it was the first one.

33:39.118 --> 33:40.317
Really?

34:00.339 --> 34:02.472
Which is the first one?

34:15.187 --> 34:16.787
Hell of a case
of reasonable doubt.

34:16.789 --> 34:18.522
You still think
Ryder's guilty?

34:18.524 --> 34:20.223
Some of that stuff is bunk--

34:20.225 --> 34:22.125
the cleaners,
the ripped plastic bag.

34:22.127 --> 34:24.261
Yeah, well, the
pins are not bunk,

34:24.263 --> 34:26.263
and the alibi witnesses
are not bunk,

34:26.265 --> 34:29.366
and this is probably
the lousiest staff work
I've ever seen.

34:29.368 --> 34:31.768
You want me to fire somebody?
Would that make you happy?

34:31.770 --> 34:34.738
The man is arrogant,
he's stupid-- he's
gonna get away with it.

34:34.740 --> 34:37.541
That fellow you planted in
his cell-- what's he getting?

34:37.543 --> 34:40.577
Ryder's teaching him
how to play bridge.

34:40.579 --> 34:42.712
How to play br...

34:47.619 --> 34:49.786
This is people's exhibit #12.

34:49.788 --> 34:51.354
Do you recognize it?

34:51.356 --> 34:53.857
It's one of a set
of four pins.

34:53.859 --> 34:55.592
My father had it made.

34:55.594 --> 35:00.330
WEBBER:
What is the history
of these four pins?

35:00.332 --> 35:02.666
BARBARA:
My daughter has two.

35:02.668 --> 35:04.267
Lois had two.

35:04.269 --> 35:06.403
She was wearing one
when she died.

35:06.405 --> 35:08.271
That one is missing.

35:08.273 --> 35:10.407
I borrowed this one
from Jonathan.

35:10.409 --> 35:13.610
Why did you borrow
your dead daughter-in-law's pin?

35:16.782 --> 35:19.783
I wanted to wear it
to Lois's funeral.

35:19.785 --> 35:23.120
I wanted to have
something of hers near me.

35:23.122 --> 35:24.855
Thank you.

35:28.127 --> 35:32.162
Mrs. Ryder, where were you
when this photo was taken?

35:33.899 --> 35:36.299
At Lois's funeral.

35:36.301 --> 35:38.368
Would you show me
where the pin is?

35:38.370 --> 35:40.770
I can't.

35:40.772 --> 35:44.374
It was high on the left side
under the collar.

35:44.376 --> 35:46.810
You can't see it.

35:46.811 --> 35:49.245
STONE:
Isn't it true that your son
gave you the pin to hide

35:49.248 --> 35:50.614
after the funeral
so the police

35:50.616 --> 35:51.648
wouldn't find it in his house?

35:51.650 --> 35:54.251
No, that is not true.

35:54.253 --> 35:56.853
And isn't it true that<i> this</i>
is the pin that Lois Ryder

35:56.855 --> 35:58.388
wore when he killed her?

35:58.390 --> 36:01.625
If my son had killed Lois,
Mr. Stone,

36:01.627 --> 36:03.860
I would be leading the pack
against him.

36:03.862 --> 36:07.330
Lois was a Ryder, too.

36:07.332 --> 36:08.865
Are we winning?

36:08.867 --> 36:11.101
Like we won Pearl Harbor.

36:11.102 --> 36:13.336
We have another rowboat
with a pee shooter
to add to the fleet.

36:13.338 --> 36:14.871
A club in Bridgehampton.

36:14.873 --> 36:16.406
Mrs. Ryder likes
the piano player.

36:16.408 --> 36:18.642
"The Girl From Ipanema."
She always requests

36:18.643 --> 36:20.877
Which would annoy him,
but she's a good tipper
after four drinks.

36:20.879 --> 36:23.480
He's pretty sure
she was there the
night of the murder.

36:23.482 --> 36:25.749
Pretty sure?
That's the<i> good</i> news--
he has no idea

36:25.751 --> 36:27.884
when she walked in--
could have been 10:00,

36:27.886 --> 36:29.819
when she swears
she was playing
games with Johnny.

36:29.821 --> 36:32.322
Or it could've been 12:00,
when Johnny was on his way

36:32.324 --> 36:34.457
not to kill his wife.
Great, we put him
on the stand

36:34.459 --> 36:36.293
as a rebuttal witness--
if Webber forgets

36:36.295 --> 36:38.495
to cross-examine,
we're all set.

36:38.496 --> 36:40.696
But if this plays out,
we won't have to.

36:41.900 --> 36:44.334
Everything's going
his way, Adam--
we got to shake him up.

36:44.336 --> 36:47.370
By telling Webber you're
gonna indict mother Ryder
for perjury and accessory

36:47.372 --> 36:49.806
based on the testimony
of a piano player.

36:49.808 --> 36:52.409
I offer to reconsider
if he pleads to manslaughter.

36:52.411 --> 36:54.377
And this piano player
does not remember

36:54.379 --> 36:56.446
when Mrs. Ryder
got to the bar.

36:56.448 --> 36:58.248
She knows when she got there.

36:58.250 --> 37:01.451
If it<i> was</i> after midnight,
her alibi story holds.

37:01.453 --> 37:04.421
That's the beauty of it--
it only works if she's lying.

37:04.423 --> 37:07.257
All this to get Ryder excited.

37:07.259 --> 37:09.926
And he's not going
to like the picture

37:09.928 --> 37:12.996
of his mother in jail.

37:12.998 --> 37:16.266
Suppose I have a witness
that puts her elsewhere?

37:16.268 --> 37:17.400
"Suppose"?

37:17.402 --> 37:18.935
Do you or don't you?

37:18.937 --> 37:21.271
Well, don't do the
deal, and find out.

37:21.273 --> 37:23.440
Even at her age,
she'll do time.

37:23.442 --> 37:25.275
You shouldn't be dealing.

37:25.277 --> 37:26.810
You should be apologizing.

37:26.812 --> 37:31.381
I'll consider manslaughter one
for him.

37:31.383 --> 37:34.818
Otherwise, it's accessory
and perjury for her.

37:34.820 --> 37:37.487
They could be
in neighboring prisons

37:37.489 --> 37:39.489
with a joint card room.

37:39.491 --> 37:43.293
Don't wait by the phone.

37:46.465 --> 37:48.999
Ryder won't crack. 34 Hours.

37:49.001 --> 37:51.868
So, Webber's been in
to see Ryder twice.

37:51.870 --> 37:54.437
I know you didn't like it.

37:54.439 --> 37:57.941
If he takes the deal,
I'd say yes.

37:57.943 --> 37:59.809
If he takes the deal

37:59.811 --> 38:02.279
I'll start buying
lottery tickets.

38:02.281 --> 38:04.014
I got to go home.

38:04.983 --> 38:06.983
Mr. Stone.
Yeah?

38:06.985 --> 38:10.387
You've got a call from Rikers.
It's Morgan.

38:10.389 --> 38:11.454
What did you guys do?

38:11.456 --> 38:13.490
Put angel dust
in his caviar?

38:13.492 --> 38:14.991
What did he say?

38:14.993 --> 38:16.960
First, nothing.
A relief.

38:16.962 --> 38:20.530
I had enough bulletins
from the society page.

38:20.532 --> 38:23.500
Then he asks me the longest term
I'd done upstate.

38:23.502 --> 38:25.402
I said a nickel.

38:25.404 --> 38:27.937
He says he might do eight to 25.

38:27.939 --> 38:29.806
You didn't ask
any questions?

38:29.808 --> 38:31.841
I put a magazine
in my mouth.

38:31.843 --> 38:34.411
He gets weepy,
says mother was right,

38:34.413 --> 38:35.512
he's a total foul-up.

38:35.514 --> 38:36.980
Couldn't kill his own wife

38:36.982 --> 38:39.082
without getting mother
sent to jail.

38:39.084 --> 38:40.784
Not bad, huh?

38:40.786 --> 38:42.352
Then he's crying

38:42.354 --> 38:44.054
his brains out.

38:44.056 --> 38:46.890
Starts talking about the bat--
the bat and Alison.

38:46.892 --> 38:47.891
Who's Alison?

38:47.893 --> 38:48.992
His little girl.

38:48.994 --> 38:52.495
Oh. Says maybe
it's for the best.

38:52.497 --> 38:54.931
How could he face her anyway?

38:54.933 --> 38:56.499
Then he shuts up.

38:56.501 --> 39:00.003
I take the magazine
out of my mouth and call you.

39:00.005 --> 39:03.373
I'm going to set up a
hearing with the judge
on Monday morning.

39:03.375 --> 39:05.375
You tell him exactly
what you told me.

39:06.545 --> 39:09.646
I always tell the truth.

39:15.454 --> 39:17.454
ROBINETTE:
It's not good.

39:17.456 --> 39:19.356
Oh, no, please.

39:19.358 --> 39:21.358
Don't tell me Morgan died.

39:21.360 --> 39:22.992
Bad case of memory loss.

39:22.994 --> 39:24.994
He says he made it all up.

39:24.996 --> 39:26.896
There was no confession.

39:26.898 --> 39:29.999
Barbara Ryder got to him.

39:30.001 --> 39:31.835
Morgan's wife--

39:31.837 --> 39:34.137
emergency visit
to Rikers yesterday.

39:34.139 --> 39:36.940
You talk to her?

39:36.942 --> 39:38.875
She's done time herself.

39:38.877 --> 39:40.410
She's got a lawyer.

39:40.412 --> 39:42.445
I wonder how much
they paid him

39:42.447 --> 39:44.447
to do another two years.

39:44.449 --> 39:46.416
Mistrial?

39:48.153 --> 39:50.453
He gave us Ryder's daughter.

39:50.455 --> 39:52.489
<i>He tampered with a witness!</i>

39:52.491 --> 39:55.692
Put away your slingshot, Stone.
I never talked to Morgan.

39:55.694 --> 39:58.428
Who visited his wife?
Larry, if you tampered
with a witness

39:58.430 --> 40:01.398
I will personally appear
at your disbarment hearing.

40:01.400 --> 40:03.566
Judge, a threat
in these circumstances?

40:03.568 --> 40:05.468
Come on,
get off of it.

40:05.470 --> 40:07.003
We're off the record.

40:07.005 --> 40:08.405
But I must tell you, Ben,

40:08.407 --> 40:10.490
I don't like jailhouse
informants.

40:10.491 --> 40:12.574
They always<i> say</i>
they keep their mouths shut.

40:12.577 --> 40:14.577
I wouldn't have admitted it
anyway.

40:14.579 --> 40:17.180
In that case, I'd like
an order to examine
Ryder's daughter, Alison,

40:17.182 --> 40:19.082
as a potential witness.

40:19.084 --> 40:21.151
An eleven-year-old
to testify against
her father?

40:21.153 --> 40:24.454
It's indecent-- not to mention
fruit of the poisonous tree.

40:24.456 --> 40:27.157
If the so-called confession
isn't admissible,

40:27.159 --> 40:29.592
neither is anything
stemming from it.

40:29.594 --> 40:31.594
Come again, Counselor?
He learned about the daughter

40:31.596 --> 40:33.463
from a confession
you say doesn't exist.

40:33.465 --> 40:35.465
According to you,
there is no poisonous tree.

40:35.467 --> 40:38.468
He had an informant
in the cell.

40:38.470 --> 40:40.136
<i>U.S. v. Ceccolini.</i>

40:40.138 --> 40:42.672
Supreme Court
allowed a witness

40:42.674 --> 40:45.475
discovered by an
illegal search.

40:45.477 --> 40:47.010
They certainly showed
greater reluctance

40:47.012 --> 40:49.512
to suppress a live witness
than physical evidence.

40:49.514 --> 40:54.117
All right, gentlemen,
this court is issuing an order.

40:54.119 --> 40:56.619
The people will get
a psychiatric examination

40:56.621 --> 40:58.488
of Mr. Ryder's daughter.

40:58.490 --> 41:00.657
Thank you, Your Honor.

41:00.659 --> 41:03.092
We were going to Barbados.

41:03.094 --> 41:06.196
after Mommy died.
It was after...

41:06.198 --> 41:11.201
he wanted his bat.
Craigie, my brother,

41:11.203 --> 41:14.237
It wasn't in the toolroom.

41:14.239 --> 41:16.506
Craigie was crying.
Daddy...

41:16.508 --> 41:18.775
we lost it at the beach,
Daddy said

41:18.777 --> 41:20.610
but I didn't think so.

41:20.612 --> 41:26.649
I saw it after the summer.
Daddy said we did, but I...

41:26.651 --> 41:30.520
I think I did.

41:30.522 --> 41:32.188
When Mommy left that day
OLIVET:

41:32.190 --> 41:34.624
she was going to the hospital
and told you

41:34.626 --> 41:37.660
do you remember
what pin she was wearing?

41:37.662 --> 41:40.530
It was mine... when I grew up.
ALISON:

41:40.532 --> 41:43.967
the special one.
Mommy always wore

41:43.969 --> 41:47.237
How was it special?
OLIVET:

41:47.239 --> 41:49.205
I don't know.

41:49.207 --> 41:52.075
She said it was a secret.

41:52.077 --> 41:55.011
She said she'd tell me someday.

41:57.516 --> 42:01.217
I think she knows
her father killed her mother.

42:01.219 --> 42:03.219
She can't deal with it.

42:03.221 --> 42:05.255
She's useless
as a witness.

42:05.257 --> 42:07.991
She can talk about the bat.

42:07.993 --> 42:10.560
She won't hold up
on the stand.

42:10.562 --> 42:12.262
SCHIFF:
The jury
will love you.

42:12.264 --> 42:15.198
She said there was a secret.

42:16.735 --> 42:21.271
Who did Lois Ryder
tell her secrets to?

42:21.273 --> 42:22.805
They bought a witness.

42:22.807 --> 42:24.541
They committed perjury.

42:24.543 --> 42:26.676
I've been following the trial.

42:26.678 --> 42:28.811
Do you know anything

42:28.813 --> 42:31.314
about the jewelry
she was wearing?

42:32.717 --> 42:35.251
You know,
your lawyer was wrong.

42:35.253 --> 42:37.320
I'll cite you
for contempt.

42:37.322 --> 42:40.189
I'll send you to jail.

42:40.191 --> 42:43.326
I'm not sure
that's the worst thing

42:43.328 --> 42:45.728
that could happen to me.

42:45.730 --> 42:49.132
Tell that to me
after you see Jonathan Ryder

42:49.134 --> 42:50.266
at the next hospital
fund-raiser.

42:50.268 --> 42:52.335
(<i> big sigh</i> )

42:57.342 --> 43:00.343
I worked occasionally
on Sunday nights.

43:00.345 --> 43:03.146
My wife accepted that.
In the course
of your affair,

43:03.148 --> 43:05.248
did you ever have
any indication

43:05.250 --> 43:08.284
that Mr. Ryder knew
of his wife's infidelity?

43:08.286 --> 43:10.620
Lois would...
uh, Mrs. Ryder...

43:10.622 --> 43:12.755
she would call her husband.

43:12.757 --> 43:14.857
She would give him excuses.

43:14.859 --> 43:16.693
They were ridiculous.

43:16.695 --> 43:18.328
Two times in a row

43:18.330 --> 43:21.764
she told him she was going
to the Monet exhibit

43:21.766 --> 43:23.199
at the Met.

43:23.201 --> 43:25.768
The Monet exhibit
was already closed.

43:25.770 --> 43:28.771
Did you ever meet
Jonathan Ryder?

43:28.773 --> 43:32.342
I saw him at hospital
fund-raising events.

43:32.344 --> 43:34.310
Did he ever indicate

43:34.312 --> 43:36.913
that he knew where you lived?

43:36.915 --> 43:40.149
FRIEDMAN:
Once. He told me
he didn't understand

43:40.151 --> 43:42.719
why a doctor would live
on the west side.

43:42.721 --> 43:46.289
He said, "Riverside Drive...

43:46.291 --> 43:50.326
not very safe over there."

43:50.328 --> 43:53.262
STONE:
Now, the last time
you saw Mrs. Ryder

43:53.264 --> 43:57.800
do you recall
what jewelry she was wearing?

43:59.204 --> 44:01.204
Her wedding ring,

44:01.206 --> 44:03.206
a necklace,

44:03.208 --> 44:05.408
a bracelet, and a pin.

44:14.352 --> 44:17.687
Dr. Friedman,
here are three pins.

44:17.689 --> 44:19.322
Do you recognize

44:19.324 --> 44:21.391
any of them?

44:34.372 --> 44:37.206
That's the one
that Lois was wearing.

44:37.208 --> 44:39.375
STONE:
Let the record indicate

44:39.377 --> 44:43.379
that he identified
people's exhibit #12.

44:43.381 --> 44:45.248
Let the record so indicate.

44:45.250 --> 44:47.784
Why did you pick that one?

44:47.786 --> 44:50.820
Mr. Ryder's grandfather
had four of them made.

44:50.822 --> 44:53.823
This one was for his daughter,
Jonathan's mother.

44:53.825 --> 44:55.224
She told Jonathan

44:55.226 --> 44:57.326
it would be
for his wife...

44:57.328 --> 45:01.998
before... he married Lois.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.200
But how did you identify it?

45:08.373 --> 45:13.309
The initial "B" is etched
into one of the leaves.

45:15.980 --> 45:20.416
When Lois got married,
she asked Jonathan

45:20.418 --> 45:23.419
to have an "L"
etched in opposite it--

45:23.421 --> 45:26.756
"L" for Lois.

45:26.758 --> 45:28.424
She waited two years.

45:30.228 --> 45:33.229
She finally had it done herself.

45:33.231 --> 45:36.232
Her mother-in-law
never knew about it.

45:38.403 --> 45:40.770
Lois always...

45:44.242 --> 45:46.876
Lois always wanted to add an "A"

45:46.878 --> 45:49.946
for when her daughter
would wear it.

45:54.853 --> 45:56.052
STONE:
Thank you.

45:56.054 --> 45:57.520
No further questions.

45:59.958 --> 46:02.391
On the sole count
of the indictment,

46:02.393 --> 46:04.327
the charge of murder

46:04.329 --> 46:06.929
in the second degree,
how does the jury find?

46:10.268 --> 46:12.769
We find the defendant guilty.

46:12.771 --> 46:15.304
(<i> cheering and applause</i> )

46:20.812 --> 46:22.879
Had a call from a lawyer

46:22.881 --> 46:25.348
representing
Dr. Friedman's wife.

46:25.350 --> 46:27.083
She filed for divorce.

46:27.085 --> 46:30.486
Wants copies of anything
her husband said to us.

46:30.488 --> 46:32.054
Another generation

46:32.056 --> 46:34.323
of Ryders.

46:40.265 --> 46:42.331
God help them.
