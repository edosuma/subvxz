WEBVTT

00:03.512 --> 00:07.931
So.. that is all for the pictures of my mom in cancún when she abandoned me

00:08.058 --> 00:12.062
Now let's move on to my mom in acapulco when she abandoned me.

00:13.246 --> 00:15.840
God, I cannot believe how good your mom looks in a bikini.

00:16.160 --> 00:18.594
I mean, she's approaching,like, me...territory.

00:19.906 --> 00:22.084
Isn't the bikini a marvelous invention?

00:22.628 --> 00:24.645
Imagine the first aztec who said,

00:25.158 --> 00:27.591
"I just gotta see some more belly button," you know?

00:28.199 --> 00:29.512
Yeah, the mexicans are

00:29.672 --> 00:31.818
such a resourceful people.

00:32.298 --> 00:34.283
Eric, don't be so stupid.

00:34.386 --> 00:36.272
Everyone knows the french invented the bikini.

00:36.374 --> 00:39.878
The mexicans just added on the top 'cause they're catholic.

00:41.108 --> 00:43.526
Another good example
of religion dividing

00:43.854 --> 00:45.781
instead of uniting.

00:45.904 --> 00:47.399
Does anyone want a soda?
- Yeah.
- Please.

00:47.440 --> 00:50.309
And F.Y.I., If god wanted mexican women to wear tops,

00:50.596 --> 00:52.154
he wouldn't have created
tequila.

00:56.289 --> 00:58.541
Where the hell's eric
with our sodas? Eric!

00:59.116 --> 01:00.100
Maybe he ran home.

01:00.641 --> 01:02.313
He's kind of a mama's boy.

01:03.198 --> 01:04.411
Eric.

01:04.477 --> 01:05.263
Oh, my god!

01:05.280 --> 01:06.203
I'm busy!

01:09.167 --> 01:10.269
Oh, my god!

01:11.765 --> 01:13.785
Ew! Was he
going to the bathroom?

01:15.254 --> 01:15.897
Non !

01:21.730 --> 01:24.571

01:55.522 --> 01:58.455
Ok, ok, ok..

01:58.608 --> 02:00.541
something happened,

02:01.711 --> 02:05.118
and, uh, I think
it's safe to say

02:05.220 --> 02:07.662
that it was certainly
in the area of horrific.

02:10.357 --> 02:12.341
Like war...

02:12.494 --> 02:15.647
or when my mom sings "do you think I'm sexy?"
While she vacuums.

02:19.462 --> 02:20.530
What happened?

02:20.664 --> 02:25.089
Well, we all know that as a young man in the prime
of his life,

02:25.740 --> 02:27.775
I have some needs.

02:28.955 --> 02:30.339
Amen, brother.

02:32.536 --> 02:34.733
Wait a minute.
This is the prime of your life?

02:34.790 --> 02:37.720
You live at home with your mommy,
and you have to wear a nametag at work.

02:39.262 --> 02:40.866
Anyway, uh...

02:42.136 --> 02:45.032
today at the house
of the woman that I was...

02:45.803 --> 02:47.970
theoretically
going to marry,

02:48.886 --> 02:52.303
I had some needs that I felt it necessary
to take care of

02:52.595 --> 02:54.011
right then and there.

02:55.199 --> 02:56.720
In her house?

02:58.226 --> 03:01.043
Why don't you do it at the bus station
like the other degenerates?

03:01.960 --> 03:03.110
It's.. I..
you know,

03:03.193 --> 03:06.410
I don't know.
There I was. There the bathroom was.

03:07.893 --> 03:10.260
It was like two trains
passing in the night.

03:12.380 --> 03:13.946
That's beautiful.

03:16.646 --> 03:18.146
You know, it kinda was.

03:20.363 --> 03:21.996
And then donna walked in.

03:22.863 --> 03:24.796
- Oh, my god!
- She didn't!

03:26.413 --> 03:29.496
I can't believe we're gonna visit kelso
at the police academy this weekend.

03:29.519 --> 03:32.415
We're gonna miss the best part--
when he makes the whole thing worse.

03:34.227 --> 03:36.852
How could I make
this worse?

03:37.311 --> 03:38.998
I don't know.

03:39.769 --> 03:42.852
Man, it seems impossible,
but you always find a way.

03:44.623 --> 03:47.811
You're like the little engine who could
of screwing yourself.

03:49.665 --> 03:52.290
You know what? This is donna's fault,
with her,

03:52.353 --> 03:55.228
you know, no more
sex till we're married crap.

03:55.874 --> 03:59.228
You guys have no idea how hard it's been
to have no sex at all.

04:04.942 --> 04:06.942
Yeah, it must be horrible.

04:09.651 --> 04:12.588
Seriously, you guys,
what do I do now?

04:13.651 --> 04:15.588
I say you gotta
pull a nixon.

04:15.651 --> 04:17.567
Deny, deny, deny.

04:18.858 --> 04:20.567
No,
you just need a good story.

04:20.651 --> 04:23.755
Whenever I get caught, I just tell people that
I'm checking for ticks.

04:30.399 --> 04:32.691
Fez, how many times
you been caught?

04:33.586 --> 04:36.581
Oh, come on, I'm not stopping
just because a doorknob turns.

04:44.361 --> 04:46.314
Whoo, man,
look at these jokers.

04:46.509 --> 04:49.016
Can't believe this is who
kelso hangs out with now.

04:49.082 --> 04:51.816
If he doesn't dunk one of these heads
in a toilet bowl, I'm buying him a skirt.

04:54.781 --> 04:55.849
Fellas.

04:59.511 --> 05:01.211
It's good
to see you boys.

05:01.328 --> 05:02.970
What the hell is that?

05:03.294 --> 05:06.178
Oh, the 'stache.
Yeah, it's coming in nice, huh?

05:07.227 --> 05:09.411
That's why the call
the fuzz "the fuzz."

05:09.927 --> 05:11.977
They're covered in fuzz.

05:13.044 --> 05:15.144
Like someone threw paint
on the "mona lisa."

05:16.069 --> 05:18.007
Oh, please,
michael kelso's a masterpiece.

05:18.049 --> 05:19.319
You know it.
I know it.

05:20.632 --> 05:23.923
Yeah, about that--
I'm going by "mike" now.

05:24.340 --> 05:26.153
It's my cop name.

05:26.569 --> 05:27.840
But we call you "kelso."

05:27.884 --> 05:30.212
Yeah, well, I'm gonna have to
ask you to call me mike!

05:32.542 --> 05:34.909
As far as the 'stache goes,
I like it.

05:34.975 --> 05:36.692
Makes me look like
an authority figure.

05:37.709 --> 05:39.659
Makes you look like
a porn star.

05:41.711 --> 05:42.982
Either way.

05:45.065 --> 05:46.752
Cadet mike.

05:47.065 --> 05:48.565
Officer kennedy,

05:48.627 --> 05:50.190
you know
my friends hyde and fez.

05:50.252 --> 05:51.356
Yeah, I remember.

05:51.398 --> 05:54.356
But it seems to me their names
were trouble and maker.

05:55.403 --> 05:57.528
"Trouble" and "maker."

05:58.278 --> 05:59.549
That's clever.

06:00.778 --> 06:03.623
I think it's funny. They put us together,
and we're troublemakers.

06:03.640 --> 06:04.392
Shut up.

06:07.358 --> 06:10.750
I hope these two delinquents don't interfere
with the progress you've been making here, mike.

06:10.782 --> 06:12.297
No, sir.
Not at all, sir.

06:12.329 --> 06:14.991
Well, we'll see.
I'll have my eye on you...

06:15.967 --> 06:17.321
on all of you.

06:19.222 --> 06:20.863
He's a good man.

06:21.592 --> 06:23.598
All right, you're really
starting to creep me out.

06:23.649 --> 06:25.352
Help me grab the beer
out of the car.

06:25.430 --> 06:28.815
I'm gonna drink until that mustache
turns into a caterpillar and crawls away.

06:29.623 --> 06:33.477
Sorro can do. I got K.P. In the A.M.
And P.T. In the P.M.

06:34.571 --> 06:36.312
Well, I don't know
what any of that means,

06:36.364 --> 06:38.786
but I came here to drink beer
and play with guns, damn it.

06:40.114 --> 06:43.135
Sorry, buddy, but we got
lights out at 22 hundsky,

06:43.187 --> 06:46.130
so I'm gonna have to ask you
to move along to the barracks asap.

06:46.625 --> 06:48.083
Did you just
call me a sap?

06:50.644 --> 06:52.759
Asap--
as soon as possible.

06:53.005 --> 06:54.876
Well, you're a sap
right now.

07:00.329 --> 07:01.875
Okay, the thing is,

07:01.957 --> 07:03.381
I knew eric did that,

07:03.462 --> 07:07.776
but knowing and seeing..
are two very different things.

07:08.630 --> 07:12.211
It's kind of like how I know
there are rats under the house.

07:12.984 --> 07:16.362
But you don't want to see the rats
diddling themselves in your bathroom.

07:16.932 --> 07:18.153
Exactly !

07:18.397 --> 07:20.472
But, donna, you're missing
the whole point here.

07:20.552 --> 07:24.155
Eric's perverted behavior can be a card
you can play for the rest of your life.

07:24.267 --> 07:27.320
Let's just say you want eric
to buy you a diamond,

07:27.482 --> 07:28.378
but he says no.

07:28.825 --> 07:29.871
You just say,

07:29.953 --> 07:32.842
"why, are you busy?"

07:34.074 --> 07:36.150
Five minutes later,
you're elizabeth taylor.

07:37.371 --> 07:41.277
Yeah, I think I need advice from a woman
in a relationship not built on blackmail.

07:41.440 --> 07:43.474
It's called
a lesbian, donna,

07:43.596 --> 07:46.119
and you're gonna have
to go to new york for that.

07:54.138 --> 07:56.463
this afternoon a cadet
named terry hit on me,

07:56.561 --> 07:59.410
and it makes me nervous
when men with guns like me.

08:00.346 --> 08:03.276
Fez, cadet terry is a woman.

08:03.439 --> 08:06.368
I know because I saw her putting cover-up
on her chin hair.

08:07.996 --> 08:10.722
Well, then,
hello there, cadet terry.

08:14.100 --> 08:16.216
I will sit here,

08:16.898 --> 08:19.071
but I will not partake.

08:19.950 --> 08:22.234
What you're doing
is illegal,

08:22.299 --> 08:26.857
and it could cause my mind to drift off its main goal,
which is enforcing the law.

08:27.801 --> 08:30.958
Now I'd like you both
to read some literature.

08:31.056 --> 08:35.482
In particular, let's take a look at
"be great and go straight."

08:35.614 --> 08:38.217
I think that one
really says it all.

08:38.347 --> 08:41.245
Hey, do not throw
the literature!

08:42.525 --> 08:43.371
Kelso..

08:43.600 --> 08:48.678
the fact that you're now totally lame
would make me furious if I had the ability to feel anger right now,

08:49.915 --> 08:52.129
which I thankfully don't.

08:53.952 --> 08:55.807
I am not lame.

08:55.937 --> 08:57.728
I am grown-up.

08:57.825 --> 08:59.420
And when you grow up,

08:59.518 --> 09:01.146
you play by the rules,

09:01.634 --> 09:04.373
which is why
I am getting rid of this.

09:06.582 --> 09:08.243
What is he doing?
WHAT IS HE DOING ?

09:09.773 --> 09:12.019
Don't worry, fez.
He's just screwing around.

09:13.939 --> 09:15.307
what?

09:17.097 --> 09:18.269
Baggie!

09:19.506 --> 09:22.209
Oh, no, he has broken you.

09:22.827 --> 09:25.366
You broke hyde,
you son of a bitch!

09:28.980 --> 09:29.761
So 

09:31.193 --> 09:33.667
do you get
what I'm saying?

09:37.053 --> 09:38.680
I think so.

09:39.751 --> 09:41.769
He was busy?

09:43.071 --> 09:44.308
In my house!

09:44.406 --> 09:46.554
I raised him
better than that!

09:47.108 --> 09:50.168
I know this is weird, but I don't have
anyone else to talk to.

09:50.233 --> 09:52.902
Really, did you call around?
I could give you some numbers.

09:53.879 --> 09:55.734
No, no, no, I'm sorry.

09:56.906 --> 09:57.980
Ok

09:58.957 --> 10:01.979
Okay, you and eric
need to be able to talk about this.

10:02.083 --> 10:05.273
I'm sure it'll be awkward
at first, but, well, then...

10:06.282 --> 10:08.886
I am afraid it's just going
to be awkward all the way through.

10:10.254 --> 10:12.890
So do you and red have
these kinds of conversations?

10:13.281 --> 10:15.495
Oh, no, no, no, no.

10:15.690 --> 10:17.871
No, we don't talk
about stuff like this.

10:17.969 --> 10:20.355
Red can't even be naked
in a room with a mirror.

10:22.406 --> 10:22.959
Right.

10:24.164 --> 10:28.168
Well, I'm sure eric and i will be able
to talk about this like we talk about everything,

10:28.266 --> 10:33.148
because that's what you do. In an open, mature
relationship, you face things head on.

10:33.734 --> 10:35.720
- Oh, god.
- Dirty!

10:44.624 --> 10:46.086
kelso, let us in.

10:46.213 --> 10:49.520
No, you're gonna hit me again.

10:50.219 --> 10:53.589
I'm warning you, I got a c-plus in billy club.

10:53.795 --> 10:55.576
just open the door!

10:55.767 --> 10:56.911
Non.

10:59.835 --> 11:01.933
damn, it's unlocked.

11:02.824 --> 11:05.050
I guess I'm gonna have to take you out.

11:12.997 --> 11:14.777
That's a nice move.

11:16.367 --> 11:18.847
Kelso, just relax.

11:19.164 --> 11:20.563
Now listen,

11:20.945 --> 11:22.280
we went on a walk.

11:22.407 --> 11:25.205
We realized you're trying to start
a new life for yourself here.

11:25.332 --> 11:26.731
We should be supportive.

11:26.921 --> 11:28.468
Really ?

11:29.259 --> 11:30.467
Thank you.

11:30.658 --> 11:33.137
No, thank you, buddy.

11:34.536 --> 11:36.380
We're gonna be great and go straight.

11:42.759 --> 11:43.840
You ready?

11:44.031 --> 11:45.112
You bet I am.

11:45.272 --> 11:48.723
Let's see you do Q.T. In the K.P. With this, you S.O.B.

11:57.186 --> 11:58.554
Morning.

11:58.684 --> 12:00.637
Well, if it isn't casanova,

12:03.241 --> 12:06.158
the man who seduced himself.

12:07.148 --> 12:08.157
Oh, god.

12:08.248 --> 12:10.174
All right, hold it, hold it. Come back here.

12:10.211 --> 12:11.261
Red, be nice.

12:11.311 --> 12:12.878
Eric, don't be embarrassed.

12:13.344 --> 12:16.603
Now you know that you can talk to us about anything,
so

12:16.677 --> 12:18.127
so come on.

12:18.194 --> 12:19.527
Let's rap.

12:21.261 --> 12:24.321
When you were a baby,
you had your hands down your pants all the time.

12:26.661 --> 12:30.011
But that's okay, because it's natural.
Red, tell him it's natural.

12:30.561 --> 12:32.594
What are you, an animal?

12:33.961 --> 12:36.061
But why wouldn't you lock the door?

12:36.860 --> 12:41.001
How could he lock the door
when he's in there pawing himself like an animal?

12:42.537 --> 12:46.157
You know, some people get addicted
and can't even hold down a job!

12:47.277 --> 12:51.105
If you can't get someone to do it for you,
you do without.

12:52.184 --> 12:55.895
In korea I went for two and a half years.

12:56.254 --> 12:58.272
Dad, you were there for three.

13:00.127 --> 13:02.276
What are you, an animal?

13:17.094 --> 13:17.843
hey.

13:17.940 --> 13:19.177
Oh, hey.

13:20.707 --> 13:22.107
Hey, why'd you knock?

13:24.321 --> 13:26.404
You know why I knocked.

13:27.153 --> 13:30.050
Eric, you've been avoiding me all day.
Let's just talk about this.

13:30.268 --> 13:32.559
There's nothing to talk about.

13:32.650 --> 13:36.003
You obviously thought you saw something
that you didn't see.

13:38.677 --> 13:40.422
I was checking for ticks.

13:42.713 --> 13:44.667
- Eric!
- Fine, okay, fine.

13:44.797 --> 13:46.984
I got caught. I'm embarrassed.

13:47.062 --> 13:49.328
Let's put this behind us.

13:49.536 --> 13:50.786
I love you.

13:51.073 --> 13:53.417
Okay, great. It's behind us.

13:53.495 --> 13:54.693
Absolutely.

13:55.448 --> 13:57.401
Um, I said, "I love you."

14:01.464 --> 14:03.182
Don't you love me, too?

14:05.188 --> 14:07.193
Sure, you know. Whatever.

14:09.208 --> 14:10.745
Can I have a hug?

14:12.411 --> 14:13.245
Fine.

14:16.422 --> 14:18.974
It's just, what got you going at my house?

14:20.614 --> 14:22.932
I mean, we were just sitting around
looking at pictures...

14:29.779 --> 14:32.618
of jackie's mom.
Jackie's mom got you going?

14:32.680 --> 14:34.997
No! What? No!

14:37.341 --> 14:38.409
- Well...
- oh!

14:40.232 --> 14:42.341
You're an animal!

14:48.616 --> 14:50.647
I can't wait for these guys to see kelso.

14:51.637 --> 14:53.095
I think I might be giddy.

14:54.527 --> 14:56.689
I know.
I feel like it's christmas morning,

14:56.741 --> 15:00.595
except instead of toys,
we get to humiliate a close friend.

15:01.952 --> 15:04.230
Hey, pete. Hey, doug.

15:08.571 --> 15:09.715
Hiya, boys.

15:10.987 --> 15:12.449
- Hi, mike!
- Hi, mike!

15:14.611 --> 15:16.073
Cadet mike,

15:16.264 --> 15:18.362
I suppose you think this is funny.

15:18.460 --> 15:19.010
What,

15:19.093 --> 15:22.960
You have made a mockery of the uniform,
and I want an explanation right now.

15:23.043 --> 15:23.860
Shut up!

15:25.166 --> 15:26.390
Dismissed!

15:31.598 --> 15:32.770
What did you guys do to me?

15:32.926 --> 15:35.192
Did you shave my head?

15:35.478 --> 15:38.030
Is there something on my back?

15:38.160 --> 15:39.332
You know what?

15:39.436 --> 15:41.989
You guys are totally stuck in high school.

15:42.041 --> 15:46.077
I'm trying to do something better.
You guys resent it. You're trying to ruin it for me.

15:46.130 --> 15:48.187
You know what? This stuff isn't even funny anymore.

15:48.786 --> 15:51.364
Oh, that's a good burn!

15:55.270 --> 15:58.760
So that's when I was, like, "no, I don't want highlights."

15:58.838 --> 16:01.728
People pay money to get their hair my color,

16:03.161 --> 16:05.583
not the other way around.

16:05.661 --> 16:08.878
Why are we feeding you again?

16:09.952 --> 16:12.166
'Cause I'm good company.

16:14.678 --> 16:18.552
Look who tore himself away from himself
long enough to join us.

16:21.612 --> 16:24.802
Yeah, usually he's too busy for lunch.

16:25.681 --> 16:27.244
All right, both of you stop.

16:27.309 --> 16:29.718
Honey, you washed your hands, right?

16:32.517 --> 16:34.829
Look, dad, I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but...

16:35.806 --> 16:38.084
can I talk to you in private for a moment?

16:38.931 --> 16:40.493
No, I don't think so.

16:42.479 --> 16:44.725
I know the kind of things you do in private.

16:47.264 --> 16:49.055
- Dad...
- oh, all right.

16:49.510 --> 16:52.115
Just keep your hands where I can see 'em.

16:54.003 --> 16:55.793
This really isn't getting old.

16:59.309 --> 17:00.058
Ok

17:00.546 --> 17:03.216
so you know how I do things that are horrible,

17:03.281 --> 17:05.690
and it seems like
I can't make them any worse,

17:07.023 --> 17:08.391
and then I do?

17:09.965 --> 17:11.593
Sadly, yes.

17:12.814 --> 17:13.750
Well...

17:13.872 --> 17:15.296
I did it again.

17:15.417 --> 17:16.395
Again?

17:17.901 --> 17:20.827
How many bathrooms does that house have?
- No,

17:21.827 --> 17:22.777
not...

17:24.718 --> 17:25.707
not that.

17:27.296 --> 17:31.515
Uh, donna wanted to talk
about the horrible thing.

17:31.567 --> 17:35.421
Oh!
They always want to talk about it.

17:36.150 --> 17:38.364
Yeah, well, we talked about it.

17:38.650 --> 17:43.832
And in the course of talking about it,
information was revealed that made it much...

17:44.692 --> 17:47.061
much worse.

17:47.478 --> 17:50.759
And that is why you never, ever talk about it.

17:51.595 --> 17:54.798
Have you ever noticed how often
I just grunt at your mother?

17:57.923 --> 18:00.215
I know how to talk. I'm not an ape.

18:01.074 --> 18:01.855
Right.

18:02.011 --> 18:04.563
I just choose not to.

18:05.892 --> 18:06.855
Right.

18:06.959 --> 18:08.808
Well, it's too latefor that now

18:08.912 --> 18:11.412
since you screwed up and talked about it.

18:12.454 --> 18:14.173
There's only one thing to do.

18:14.667 --> 18:17.532
Go on the offensive.
Counter attack.

18:17.688 --> 18:19.772
What? That's suicide, man.

18:20.657 --> 18:23.027
They'll never expect it. It throws 'em off.

18:23.131 --> 18:26.777
You know, one time in korea,
we had this little guy outnumbered 20 to 1.

18:26.959 --> 18:29.589
But then he ran at us screaming his head off.

18:29.720 --> 18:33.912
And we were so taken off guard,
that we dove right into our foxholes.

18:35.527 --> 18:37.222
- And he got away?
- No, no.

18:39.123 --> 18:43.628
No, I mean we were startled for a few seconds,
but then the whole company just opened up on him.

18:47.162 --> 18:49.297
Listen up, donna. I got something to say.

18:49.366 --> 18:51.319
Okay, but be careful.

18:51.423 --> 18:53.351
Jackie's mom was here earlier.

18:54.522 --> 18:58.481
I don't want you to catch a whiff of her perfume
and have to sexually assault yourself in the hallway.

18:59.630 --> 19:02.078
No, no, no, no. I talk. You listen.

19:02.390 --> 19:04.942
Okay,this is all your fault.

19:05.672 --> 19:08.406
Yeah, do you have any idea what your celibacy thing
is doing to me?

19:08.464 --> 19:10.558
My needs have risen to near..

19:10.625 --> 19:12.344
fezian levels.

19:14.141 --> 19:15.860
He is a sick bastard, donna,

19:15.895 --> 19:18.180
and now, thanks to you, so am I!

19:18.947 --> 19:22.364
Yeah, that's right, donna! You created a monster.
I can't leave myself alone!

19:24.189 --> 19:25.481
You know what? You're right.

19:26.126 --> 19:27.147
I'm sorry.

19:27.397 --> 19:28.293
You are?

19:28.835 --> 19:29.856
I mean, um...

19:31.043 --> 19:32.564
yeah, damn right you are.

19:33.668 --> 19:35.439
No, this has been really hard,

19:36.001 --> 19:38.210
and this celibacy thing was my idea,
so 

19:38.939 --> 19:41.376
I need to accept some responsibility
for the odd and

19:41.460 --> 19:43.689
disgusting things you do.

19:44.648 --> 19:46.502
That's right, you do.

19:46.627 --> 19:49.481
But, you know, next time, be like a normal person.

19:49.772 --> 19:51.793
Go to your room, lock the door,

19:51.856 --> 19:55.356
light some candles,
put on some al green and make an evening of it.

19:57.814 --> 20:00.960
Wow, donna, that was really detailed.

20:01.793 --> 20:03.502
It's almost like...

20:08.731 --> 20:10.563
oh, my god.

20:13.167 --> 20:15.271
You do it, too!

20:16.271 --> 20:17.334
What ?

20:17.417 --> 20:19.208
no, no!

20:19.938 --> 20:23.459
I noticed the candles getting lower,
even though I'd never seen them lit!

20:25.480 --> 20:28.209
All right, this conversation is over!

20:32.201 --> 20:33.014
Wow

20:36.118 --> 20:39.472
So this is where it all happens.

20:50.276 --> 20:52.047
So they make
an evening of it?

20:52.547 --> 20:55.047
Yeah, candles, music.

20:55.151 --> 20:57.422
God, girls do everything better.

20:58.380 --> 20:59.984
You don't suppose jackie...

21:01.130 --> 21:03.713
nah, she won't even go
to a self-serve gas station.

21:04.317 --> 21:06.922
What would happen if I walked in
during one of their evenings?

21:07.026 --> 21:10.621
Are they like us where even though we're alone,
we welcome a visitor?

21:11.683 --> 21:15.558
It's not like they'd rather do it themselves,
when they could have a man do it, right?

21:15.621 --> 21:17.496
- Yeah.
- Right.
