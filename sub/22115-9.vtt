00:02.536 --> 00:03.804
Hi, I'm Jeffrey Tanner.

00:03.837 --> 00:04.938
Welcome to Sophe.

00:04.972 --> 00:08.042
We all know the Internet
changed the world.

00:08.076 --> 00:10.111
The only question is:
into what?

00:10.144 --> 00:11.545
It can be a platform
to bring us together

00:11.579 --> 00:13.147
or to tear us apart.

00:13.181 --> 00:14.448
I know, because I spent my life

00:14.482 --> 00:16.384
trying to turn it
into something

00:16.417 --> 00:18.486
that would connect us all.
Then...

00:18.519 --> 00:20.521
I love you, Dad.
...my daughter was murdered.

00:20.554 --> 00:22.423
Nothing else mattered anymore.

00:22.456 --> 00:24.458
Everyone was sure
they knew who did it--

00:24.492 --> 00:26.260
the police, my ex-wife--

00:26.294 --> 00:28.129
but I was convinced the
wrong man had been convicted

00:28.162 --> 00:30.064
and the real killer
was still out there.

00:30.098 --> 00:32.100
So together with my team,
I built Sophe,

00:32.133 --> 00:34.435
a crowdsource
crime solving platform

00:34.468 --> 00:37.305
powered by the smartest,
most diverse,

00:37.338 --> 00:40.374
independent collection of
detectives on the planet:

00:40.408 --> 00:43.111
you.

00:43.144 --> 00:45.146
Let's get to work.

00:45.179 --> 00:46.680
Previously
on Wisdom of the Crowd...

00:46.714 --> 00:49.117
Nell DeGraf sent
a cease-and-desist,

00:49.150 --> 00:51.852
claiming Sophe's running code
stolen from AllSourcer.

00:51.885 --> 00:55.289
SARA: Are you saying AllSourcer
does actually own the code?

00:55.323 --> 00:57.125
And anything that's
a direct result of it.

00:57.158 --> 00:58.626
But that's everything.

00:58.659 --> 01:00.861
That's all of Sophe.
Make nice with Nell.

01:00.894 --> 01:03.631
TANNER: And give her a stake
in Sophe? No.

01:03.664 --> 01:06.434
Tell him I might know
who killed Mia Tanner.

01:06.467 --> 01:08.302
You should've just kept
your mouth shut about that girl.

01:08.336 --> 01:10.138
(grunting)

01:20.714 --> 01:23.551
I thought you said
these depositions

01:23.584 --> 01:25.719
were meant to happen
on neutral ground.

01:25.753 --> 01:27.188
This is neutral ground.

01:27.221 --> 01:28.456
You know,

01:28.489 --> 01:31.259
somewhere between
a Renaissance fair

01:31.292 --> 01:33.093
and Henry VIII's
favorite whorehouse.

01:36.597 --> 01:39.533
All this over 136 lines of code.

01:39.567 --> 01:41.602
And you, of course.

01:41.635 --> 01:43.604
They're ready for us, Jeffrey.

01:43.637 --> 01:45.606
Are we absolutely certain
we don't want

01:45.639 --> 01:47.475
to just sell AllSourcer
an interest in Sophe,

01:47.508 --> 01:49.743
and make all of this go away?

01:49.777 --> 01:51.745
Yes.
Yes.

01:51.779 --> 01:52.746
All right.

01:52.780 --> 01:55.149
Shall we?

01:55.183 --> 01:57.151
Let's get this out of the way.

01:57.185 --> 02:00.354
Don't want to keep Cruella
de Vil waiting any longer.

02:00.388 --> 02:03.257
Let's try and keep things civil,
shall we, Jeffrey?

02:06.327 --> 02:08.496
Jeffrey. Always a pleasure.

02:08.529 --> 02:11.165
Although I wish it were under
different circumstances.

02:11.199 --> 02:13.367
Which circumstances? You mean,
the fact that you've hired

02:13.401 --> 02:15.936
this... '80s movie villain
to hijack my ideas

02:15.969 --> 02:18.306
because you're
constitutionally incapable

02:18.339 --> 02:20.174
of coming up with your own?

02:20.208 --> 02:21.942
Shall we begin?

02:21.975 --> 02:24.178
(clears throat)

02:26.280 --> 02:27.448
(camera beeps)

02:29.283 --> 02:30.751
Fire when ready.

02:30.784 --> 02:32.953
CONRYN: Mr. Tanner,
in your capacity

02:32.986 --> 02:34.722
as the former CEO
of AllSourcer,

02:34.755 --> 02:37.658
can you tell us how the company
first came to hire Sara Morton?

02:37.691 --> 02:39.393
The company?

02:39.427 --> 02:41.595
No, the AllSourcer board
didn't have the vision

02:41.629 --> 02:43.664
to find someone like Sara,
much less hire her.

02:43.697 --> 02:45.433
I mean, while they
were focus grouping

02:45.466 --> 02:46.800
which shade of navy

02:46.834 --> 02:48.969
was least offensive
to the most amount of people,

02:49.002 --> 02:51.672
Sara was doing research

02:51.705 --> 02:55.276
that would revolutionize
user engagement.

02:55.309 --> 02:58.412
So you didn't go through the
usual hiring channels, then?

02:58.446 --> 03:02.416
No. Sara wasn't the usual hire.

03:02.450 --> 03:04.352
SARA:
I have a message

03:04.385 --> 03:06.520
for the tech industry:

03:06.554 --> 03:08.989
you are doing it wrong.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.691
The future of technology
doesn't lie

03:10.724 --> 03:13.494
in likes or shares.

03:13.527 --> 03:16.297
It lies in using
the new global village

03:16.330 --> 03:20.268
to accomplish tasks
no individual ever could.

03:20.301 --> 03:21.469
Important tasks.

03:21.502 --> 03:24.238
Things like determining
how many condoms

03:24.272 --> 03:27.241
are in the student health
center's free condom bowl.

03:27.275 --> 03:28.276
(laughter)

03:29.410 --> 03:31.545
For, uh, research purposes,

03:31.579 --> 03:34.515
I positioned myself beside
this bowl for three days,

03:34.548 --> 03:37.785
and I asked any student
who came by to estimate.

03:37.818 --> 03:40.854
The mean value
of all the student estimates

03:40.888 --> 03:44.325
was 963 condoms.

03:44.358 --> 03:45.493
(beeps)

03:45.526 --> 03:50.864
The correct answer was 962.5,

03:50.898 --> 03:53.734
as one condom
at the bottom of the bowl

03:53.767 --> 03:56.337
had been mysteriously separated
from its packaging.

03:56.370 --> 03:57.438
(laughter)

03:57.471 --> 04:02.610
This is the magic
of crowdsourcing.

04:02.643 --> 04:05.479
An old saying goes
that a person is smart,

04:05.513 --> 04:07.881
but people are dumb.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.883
Well, I'm here to tell you
that, actually,

04:09.917 --> 04:12.353
the complete opposite is true.

04:12.386 --> 04:14.622
The crowd,
when properly motivated

04:14.655 --> 04:17.758
and sufficiently diverse
and independent

04:17.791 --> 04:19.760
in its decision making,

04:19.793 --> 04:22.730
is far smarter than
any individual ever could be.

04:22.763 --> 04:25.899
Now, imagine this same principle

04:25.933 --> 04:27.901
applied to agriculture,
to flood relief,

04:27.935 --> 04:29.870
to the eradication of disease.

04:29.903 --> 04:33.907
To building better and more
innovative businesses.

04:33.941 --> 04:36.377
The world is sitting
on a resource

04:36.410 --> 04:39.513
of our collective wisdom.

04:39.547 --> 04:42.416
I say, let's start mining it.

04:45.519 --> 04:47.087
Hi.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.089
Excuse me. Jeffrey Tanner.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.758
I run a company
called AllSourcer.

04:50.791 --> 04:53.394
Um, yes, I believe
I've heard of it.

04:53.427 --> 04:55.796
Listen, um, I read
your dissertation.

04:55.829 --> 04:57.531
Very impressive.

04:57.565 --> 04:59.633
My dissertation's three months
from publication.

04:59.667 --> 05:00.601
What can I say? I know people.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.770
Listen, the point is,
I want to hire you.

05:04.605 --> 05:06.106
If you can use that research

05:06.139 --> 05:08.342
and apply it to the AllSourcer
business model,

05:08.376 --> 05:10.344
I will build you

05:10.378 --> 05:12.913
any lab you want,
hire you any team you want.

05:14.648 --> 05:15.649
Me?

05:15.683 --> 05:16.784
Yeah.

05:16.817 --> 05:19.420
Why?
Because you see things

05:19.453 --> 05:20.954
other people don't.
And I don't want you

05:20.988 --> 05:23.524
seeing them for the competition.

05:23.557 --> 05:25.493
(phone buzzing)

05:25.526 --> 05:27.361
It's my daughter.

05:27.395 --> 05:29.129
Can you just give me one second?

05:29.162 --> 05:31.399
(phone continues buzzing)
Don't go anywhere.

05:31.432 --> 05:32.400
(buzzing)

05:32.433 --> 05:33.667
(Conryn clears throat)

05:33.701 --> 05:35.969
You offered to cover
the rest of the cost

05:36.003 --> 05:38.706
of her doctoral program,
too, didn't you?
Yes.

05:38.739 --> 05:43.411
Guilty. I also, uh,
I covered dental and a 401k.

05:43.444 --> 05:44.912
Do we need to talk
about that, as well?

05:44.945 --> 05:46.447
You know? I mean...

05:46.480 --> 05:47.581
(phone buzzing)
(clears throat)

05:47.615 --> 05:49.450
(scoffs)

05:49.483 --> 05:50.818
Are we distracting you, Jeffrey?

05:50.851 --> 05:53.387
I'm sorry.
I need to take this.

05:57.958 --> 05:59.427
Hello?

05:59.460 --> 06:00.360
RECORDED VOICE:
You have a collect call

06:00.394 --> 06:03.464
from a prisoner
at Vacaville State Prison.

06:03.497 --> 06:04.732
Will you accept the charges?

06:04.765 --> 06:05.933
Uh, yeah. I'll accept--

06:05.966 --> 06:07.735
of course I will. Yes.

06:07.768 --> 06:08.936
One moment, please.

06:08.969 --> 06:10.971
(line ringing)

06:11.004 --> 06:12.005
(line picks up)

06:12.039 --> 06:13.607
Hello?

06:13.641 --> 06:15.008
FLACO:
Is this Tanner?

06:15.042 --> 06:17.010
Yeah, this is Jeffrey Tanner.
Who is this?

06:17.044 --> 06:18.546
(chuckles)
I know who shanked

06:18.579 --> 06:21.014
your daughter's boyfriend
in prison.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.683
How about you earn
those billable hours,

06:22.716 --> 06:24.017
and get him to see reason,

06:24.051 --> 06:26.454
while he still has something
left to fight for.

06:26.487 --> 06:28.489
(whispers)

06:28.522 --> 06:29.890
He...

06:29.923 --> 06:31.825
Oh, you have got
to be kidding me.

06:31.859 --> 06:34.495
Did you know your client
just took off in a cab?

06:34.528 --> 06:36.530
(door buzzes, latch clicks)

06:37.898 --> 06:41.869
(door closes)

06:41.902 --> 06:43.036
(clears throat)

06:43.070 --> 06:46.507
So you know
who stabbed Carlos Ochoa?

06:46.540 --> 06:48.208
Oh, yeah.

06:48.241 --> 06:49.042
(laughs)

06:49.076 --> 06:50.511
It was me.

06:50.544 --> 06:51.845
Heh, two times in the gut, man.

06:51.879 --> 06:53.514
I cranked it real hard
on the second one.

06:53.547 --> 06:55.783
I mean, that usually
does the trick, right?

06:55.816 --> 06:58.519
Guess the kid's a lot tougher
than he looks.

06:58.552 --> 07:02.490
But, I'll tell you what, though,
the question isn't who did it.

07:02.523 --> 07:03.524
It's why.

07:03.557 --> 07:05.926
Did someone put you up to this?

07:05.959 --> 07:08.696
Who?

07:08.729 --> 07:10.564
Did it have something to do
with my daughter?

07:10.598 --> 07:11.965
Oh, there you go.

07:11.999 --> 07:13.233
Now you're thinking.

07:13.266 --> 07:15.469
Yeah.

07:15.503 --> 07:17.971
Why are you telling me this?

07:18.005 --> 07:20.040
'Cause I need that
machine you built.

07:20.073 --> 07:21.975
I got a little niece.

07:22.009 --> 07:23.944
Real sweet girl.

07:23.977 --> 07:26.880
Cops are trying to pin a murder
on her, but she didn't do it.

07:26.914 --> 07:28.549
How can you be sure
that she's innocent?

07:28.582 --> 07:30.484
Because she's
innocent, man.

07:30.518 --> 07:32.252
Okay.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.988
If they try to charge me
with anything, I'll deny it all.

07:36.590 --> 07:39.026
But you help me get Julia off,

07:39.059 --> 07:41.562
and I'll tell you
everything I know.

07:43.096 --> 07:45.265
JOSH:
Julia Guerrero.

07:45.298 --> 07:49.837
Arrests for assault, grand theft
auto, another assault.

07:49.870 --> 07:51.004
Well, that's a statement.

07:51.038 --> 07:53.073
JOSH: Ooh!
Click the video.

07:53.106 --> 07:55.075
(mouse clicks)

07:55.108 --> 07:56.644
(people shouting)

07:56.677 --> 07:58.045
Kill this bitch!

07:58.078 --> 07:59.913
JOSH: This is not what
I've been led to believe

07:59.947 --> 08:01.549
girl fights look like.

08:01.582 --> 08:02.583
TARIQ:
Who did this girl kill again?

08:02.616 --> 08:03.884
TANNER:
Hopefully, no one.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.619
Listen, Cavanaugh's
coming in now

08:05.653 --> 08:08.522
and, uh, he's gonna
fill us in on this case.

08:08.556 --> 08:12.092
If he asks, we got the case from
an anonymous tip. All right?

08:12.125 --> 08:13.861
Wait, h-how did we
pick up this case?

08:13.894 --> 08:16.830
Anonymous tip.

08:16.864 --> 08:19.567
Thanks for coming in, Detective.

08:19.600 --> 08:20.634
Sure hope I don't regret it.

08:20.668 --> 08:22.636
(chuckles)
What do we got?

08:22.670 --> 08:24.638
The victim you asked about,
her name is Tammy Wyland.

08:24.672 --> 08:26.607
She and Julia were roommates.

08:26.640 --> 08:27.841
On the night
of the murder,

08:27.875 --> 08:29.610
we got a 911
call from one

08:29.643 --> 08:30.678
of the girls'
neighbors.

08:30.711 --> 08:32.613
Unis found Tammy
stabbed to death.

08:32.646 --> 08:34.882
So why are you guys
trying to pin this on Julia?

08:34.915 --> 08:36.650
Nobody's trying to pin anything
on anybody.

08:36.684 --> 08:38.619
The cops on the
scene found Julia

08:38.652 --> 08:39.920
in the building's
recycling area,

08:39.953 --> 08:41.889
trying to burn a pile
of her own bloody clothes.

08:41.922 --> 08:44.792
You know what the first
thing she said to them was?

08:44.825 --> 08:46.627
"I didn't stab that bitch."

08:46.660 --> 08:47.828
(whistles)
Okay.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.329
All right. Post it.

08:49.362 --> 08:51.131
Actually, you know what?
I'm gonna post it myself.

08:51.164 --> 08:53.934
So I can make sure
what really happened.

08:53.967 --> 08:55.903
Hold on. What "really happened"?

08:55.936 --> 08:59.707
Tanner, what is your sudden
interest in this case, anyway?

08:59.740 --> 09:01.575
I just want to see justice done.

09:01.609 --> 09:03.644
That's funny,
because I heard that you visited

09:03.677 --> 09:07.815
the girl's gangbanging uncle
in prison.

09:07.848 --> 09:12.052
So you want to come again
with this anonymous tip story?

09:13.821 --> 09:16.156
You're gonna bet your daughter's
case on this girl?

09:16.189 --> 09:17.691
I don't have much of a choice.

09:17.725 --> 09:18.926
He-- this guy Flaco

09:18.959 --> 09:20.661
stabbed Carlos Ochoa
to shut him up.

09:20.694 --> 09:23.196
That's a damn big "if," Tanner.

09:23.230 --> 09:26.033
More likely,
this gangbanger needs a favor,

09:26.066 --> 09:28.368
and he figures you're desperate
enough to give it to him.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.170
Sophe partnered
with your department,

09:30.203 --> 09:32.172
but that partnership
goes both ways, remember?

09:32.205 --> 09:35.643
Look, Detective,

09:35.676 --> 09:38.946
I need to know the truth,
all right?

09:38.979 --> 09:41.048
And I think you
do, as well.

09:41.081 --> 09:43.951
This is the biggest lead
we've had so far

09:43.984 --> 09:46.386
in my daughter's case.

09:46.419 --> 09:49.589
Now, are you gonna help me,
or not?

09:52.159 --> 09:54.594
*

10:04.938 --> 10:07.407
Like I told the cops
at the scene, bitch was cray.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.276
"Cray," how?

10:09.309 --> 10:11.244
Specifically.

10:11.278 --> 10:15.182
One minute, she'd be fine, then
all the sudden she's losing it,

10:15.215 --> 10:19.252
running around screaming
that I stole her lingerie.

10:19.286 --> 10:21.421
Bitch is shooting up
in the bathroom,

10:21.454 --> 10:24.391
and banging married dudes,
and I'm the problem?

10:24.424 --> 10:27.928
Flat-ass spankies
wouldn't even fit me.

10:29.329 --> 10:32.165
The coroner didn't find
any drugs in Tammy's system.

10:32.199 --> 10:34.167
I've been around, okay?

10:34.201 --> 10:38.739
I know what used needles and
puke in the bathroom adds up to.

10:38.772 --> 10:41.174
Okay, what about
the-the married guys?

10:41.208 --> 10:43.043
Do you know any of their names?

10:43.076 --> 10:46.046
Tammy and I met
on the Internet, okay?

10:46.079 --> 10:49.783
She needed a roommate, fast,
I needed a cheap place to crash.

10:49.817 --> 10:52.352
We didn't exactly
share our life stories.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.956
Yeah.

10:55.989 --> 10:58.158
I know what
you're thinking.

10:58.191 --> 11:02.029
You see a girl like me and a
girl like Tammy scrapping it up,

11:02.062 --> 11:04.998
you automatically swipe white.

11:05.032 --> 11:07.000
Oh, is that what I do?

11:07.034 --> 11:08.435
I swipe white, do I?

11:08.468 --> 11:10.771
(door opens)
Come on.

11:10.804 --> 11:12.239
What's up?

11:12.272 --> 11:15.008
Can I see you in my office,
please?

11:15.042 --> 11:17.077
Yeah.

11:17.110 --> 11:18.445
Just...

11:18.478 --> 11:21.114
relax.

11:21.148 --> 11:23.016
You tell him,
lady cop.

11:23.050 --> 11:25.118
Dude needs to
learn some respect!

11:33.126 --> 11:34.461
You want to explain this?

11:34.494 --> 11:38.131
It's not exactly how
I'd have put it...

11:38.165 --> 11:41.201
Once again, your buddy Tanner

11:41.234 --> 11:45.038
is actively trying
to undermine an SFPD case.

11:45.072 --> 11:47.040
Why are you helping him?

11:50.277 --> 11:52.079
The girl's uncle...

11:52.880 --> 11:56.116
He's a shot caller at Vacaville.

11:56.149 --> 11:58.518
Says he has intel about
what happened to Carlos Ochoa.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.120
And you believe him?

12:00.153 --> 12:01.488
I didn't say
I believe him.

12:01.521 --> 12:03.123
But if he's got
something to say,

12:03.156 --> 12:04.124
hell, yeah, I want to hear it.

12:04.157 --> 12:05.859
So, look,
you're in here

12:05.893 --> 12:08.128
because you brought in
Mia Tanner's killer.

12:08.161 --> 12:10.130
I'm still out there

12:10.163 --> 12:12.099
because I made too much noise

12:12.132 --> 12:14.201
about how I wasn't sure
it was Carlos Ochoa.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.402
There's a difference

12:15.435 --> 12:17.137
between having doubts

12:17.170 --> 12:19.039
and playing for Team Tanner.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.407
I'm playing for Team Me,
all right?

12:20.440 --> 12:22.275
I need to know

12:22.309 --> 12:25.145
if I tanked my career
for nothing.

12:31.118 --> 12:33.486
I still think
you're being played.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.555
But...?

12:35.588 --> 12:39.526
But... you and I were partners
on the Mia Tanner case...

12:41.895 --> 12:46.066
...which, I guess, makes us
partners on this one, too.

12:48.568 --> 12:49.502
And in the unlikely event

12:49.536 --> 12:53.073
that this gangbanger's
telling the truth...

12:54.541 --> 12:57.144
...we'll find it out together.

12:57.177 --> 13:00.180
Thank you.

13:00.213 --> 13:01.581
CONRYN:
Ms. Morton.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.350
Can I assume that you'll be
with us for the entirety

13:03.383 --> 13:05.118
of this court-mandated
process?

13:05.152 --> 13:06.153
Yes.

13:06.186 --> 13:07.888
So, no family
emergencies?

13:07.921 --> 13:09.823
No sudden, mysterious
phone calls?

13:09.857 --> 13:11.091
I think you've made your point,

13:11.124 --> 13:12.359
don't you?

13:12.392 --> 13:13.927
So. Jeffrey Tanner
hired you to build

13:13.961 --> 13:15.328
a crowdsourcing
interface for AllSourcer.

13:15.362 --> 13:16.930
Is that correct?

13:16.964 --> 13:19.499
Jeffrey brought me
to AllSourcer

13:19.532 --> 13:21.935
because the company was
hemorrhaging users.

13:21.969 --> 13:24.171
Although, as I recall,

13:24.204 --> 13:27.174
he didn't much like my plan
for bringing them back.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.515
You, uh, wanted
to see me?
Yeah.

13:35.548 --> 13:36.950
My security team tells me

13:36.984 --> 13:38.551
that you're responsible

13:38.585 --> 13:40.954
for the recent uptick
in the firewall breaches?

13:40.988 --> 13:44.124
874 of them in the past week.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.526
Well, there was a vulnerability
in the platform.

13:46.559 --> 13:48.561
I very selectively
decreased protections

13:48.595 --> 13:52.165
so users could take a crack
at patching it up.

13:52.199 --> 13:54.868
In other words,
you let complete strangers

13:54.902 --> 13:57.270
paw through
our proprietary code.

13:57.304 --> 13:58.939
That's not why
I hired you.

13:58.972 --> 14:01.174
Actually, it is.

14:01.208 --> 14:04.945
Um, if you read the report
I sent, you'll see that users

14:04.978 --> 14:06.579
have come up with some

14:06.613 --> 14:09.182
impressively
innovative solutions.

14:09.216 --> 14:11.184
This... this kid,
Josh Novak,

14:11.218 --> 14:14.221
he sent in a hashtag algorithm
that can scramble user...

14:14.254 --> 14:15.555
We already have
a hashtag algorithm.

14:15.588 --> 14:17.190
Uh, well, his is better.

14:17.224 --> 14:18.591
Anyway, that's not the point.

14:18.625 --> 14:20.961
Each of the users that
I've tapped for this project

14:20.994 --> 14:25.365
has spent upwards of 23 hours
on the site this week.

14:25.398 --> 14:28.235
23 hours?
Mm-hmm.

14:28.268 --> 14:29.937
I double-checked the numbers.

14:30.637 --> 14:32.539
It's-it's not about

14:32.572 --> 14:34.641
solving the problem,
it's more about...

14:34.674 --> 14:37.177
Galvanizing the users.

14:37.210 --> 14:41.214
You've been trying to get users
to engage with AllSourcer,

14:41.248 --> 14:42.215
when you should
have been...

14:42.249 --> 14:44.384
Empowering them to build it.

14:44.417 --> 14:46.186
Exactly.

14:46.219 --> 14:49.222
That's good work.

14:49.256 --> 14:50.390
Thank you.

14:53.493 --> 14:54.995
Oh, um...

14:55.028 --> 14:56.930
if you'd like this
project to continue,

14:56.964 --> 14:58.565
I'm gonna need six more servers,

14:58.598 --> 15:01.401
a patent lawyer
and a bigger hiring budget.

15:01.434 --> 15:05.538
So I can get this...
Josh on my team.

15:05.572 --> 15:06.940
Hmm.

15:08.475 --> 15:10.410
Their lawyer
is furious you left.

15:10.443 --> 15:11.578
Where did you disappear to?

15:11.611 --> 15:13.346
I'm sorry. It's a long story.

15:13.380 --> 15:15.215
I promise you, I'll fix it.

15:15.248 --> 15:16.216
How you holding up?

15:16.249 --> 15:18.051
Well, uh, considering

15:18.085 --> 15:20.220
I've spent the last half hour

15:20.253 --> 15:22.956
being deposed by some
frat boy twit

15:22.990 --> 15:24.591
who wants to get me deported...

15:24.624 --> 15:26.426
(chuckles) Listen.
It'll be fine.

15:26.459 --> 15:28.028
If you lose your visa,

15:28.061 --> 15:30.230
we'll keep you in the country
by getting married.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.232
Married? God, no.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.068
Sorry.

15:35.102 --> 15:37.470
That, um...

15:37.504 --> 15:39.472
That didn't come out
like I meant it to.

15:39.506 --> 15:42.309
Um... at all.

15:44.377 --> 15:46.079
Sara?

15:46.113 --> 15:48.515
Uh, they're calling
me back inside.

15:48.548 --> 15:49.649
Uh, we'll talk about this later,

15:49.682 --> 15:51.351
all right?

15:51.384 --> 15:52.552
Yeah. Sure.

15:54.521 --> 15:56.323
Okay, then.

15:56.356 --> 16:01.028
WOMAN: That Julia,
she was nothing but trouble.

16:01.061 --> 16:03.363
She always played that...
what do you call that music

16:03.396 --> 16:05.999
where they shout out
profanities?

16:06.033 --> 16:07.000
Rap?

16:07.034 --> 16:10.270
(exhales) It was so loud
I could barely think.

16:10.303 --> 16:13.406
And Tammy, she would
always apologize for it.

16:13.440 --> 16:16.709
But whenever I complained, that
Julia would just curse me out.

16:16.743 --> 16:18.078
Tammy's been living

16:18.111 --> 16:20.447
in that unit up there
since last spring.

16:20.480 --> 16:23.383
Against my better judgment,
I let her sign Julia

16:23.416 --> 16:25.485
onto the lease
about two months ago.

16:25.518 --> 16:26.719
But you manage
the place?

16:26.753 --> 16:29.322
Oh, just, uh, for the free rent.

16:29.356 --> 16:31.358
I'm really in IT solutions.

16:31.391 --> 16:33.526
Julia was a total psycho.

16:33.560 --> 16:35.628
Remember, she dragged Tammy
down the hall by her hair?

16:35.662 --> 16:37.364
You saw this happen?

16:37.397 --> 16:38.398
Well, no.

16:38.431 --> 16:39.599
But I totally heard them

16:39.632 --> 16:41.301
fighting
all the time.
CAVANAUGH:
Uh-huh.

16:41.334 --> 16:42.769
What about Tammy?

16:42.802 --> 16:45.138
All right, did any of you
ever hear about a...

16:45.172 --> 16:46.773
a drug habit?

16:46.806 --> 16:48.075
(laughs)
Tammy?

16:48.108 --> 16:49.076
No way.

16:49.109 --> 16:51.378
She was, like, so chill.

16:51.411 --> 16:52.345
Even my parents
liked her.

16:52.379 --> 16:53.580
What about boyfriends?

16:53.613 --> 16:56.116
Maybe one of them was married,
jealous wife...

16:56.149 --> 16:57.517
Anything?

16:57.550 --> 16:58.818
I never saw her with any men.

16:58.851 --> 17:01.688
Not like that slut Julia.

17:01.721 --> 17:05.825
I told Tammy she shouldn't get
a roommate off the Internet.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.694
If she'd picked
the nice girl with the cats,

17:07.727 --> 17:09.729
she'd still be alive.

17:11.431 --> 17:13.333
Yeah.

17:13.366 --> 17:15.168
TARIQ: Look, it physically
pains me to say this,

17:15.202 --> 17:16.636
but have we considered
the possibility

17:16.669 --> 17:18.138
that the police
got it right?

17:18.171 --> 17:20.440
(computer chiming)
Maybe Julia
really is guilty.

17:20.473 --> 17:22.142
A user wants to video chat
with us about Tammy.

17:22.175 --> 17:24.111
Put it up.

17:24.144 --> 17:25.112
Is this... "Cecilia"?

17:25.145 --> 17:26.579
Yes.

17:26.613 --> 17:29.416
My scumbag boss, he was
sleeping with that Tammy girl,

17:29.449 --> 17:30.650
the one that got killed?

17:30.683 --> 17:33.720
His name is Rob Forsythe,
with an "E."

17:33.753 --> 17:36.456
He used to make me buy her
smutty underwear

17:36.489 --> 17:39.392
and put it on the company card
so his wife wouldn't find out.

17:39.426 --> 17:41.394
Hello, married boyfriend.

17:41.428 --> 17:44.431
Of course, it's kind of hard to
keep your mistress under wraps

17:44.464 --> 17:46.366
when she shows up
in the company parking lot

17:46.399 --> 17:47.567
to smash in your windshield.

17:47.600 --> 17:51.438
Anyway, the night
that Tammy was killed,

17:51.471 --> 17:53.440
Mr. Forsythe
went to her apartment

17:53.473 --> 17:54.574
to break it off for good.

17:54.607 --> 17:56.209
(toilet flushing)

17:56.243 --> 17:58.411
Ma'am, are you
in the ladies' room?

17:58.445 --> 18:01.648
(whispers): It's the only place
I have any privacy around here.

18:03.783 --> 18:05.685
I'm calling Cavanaugh.

18:05.718 --> 18:08.555
So, what? I'm the first guy
to ever cheat on his wife?

18:08.588 --> 18:10.423
No.

18:10.457 --> 18:12.525
You're the last guy
to see Tammy Wyland alive.

18:12.559 --> 18:14.627
We know you were
at her apartment

18:14.661 --> 18:16.163
the night she was murdered.

18:16.196 --> 18:17.897
I was out of there
by about 8:00,

18:17.930 --> 18:19.199
at the latest.

18:19.232 --> 18:21.168
I heard the time of death
was, what?

18:21.201 --> 18:23.136
Around 11:00 or something,
right?
Maybe.

18:23.170 --> 18:26.906
So how'd you feel after Tammy
smashed your windshield?

18:26.939 --> 18:29.242
When Tam... Oh... (chuckles)

18:29.276 --> 18:31.178
No, dude, you got
that all wrong.

18:31.211 --> 18:32.412
Tammy didn't smash
my windshield.

18:32.445 --> 18:33.646
My wife did.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.815
Your wife?
Yeah.

18:35.848 --> 18:37.850
I gave Tammy the boot,

18:37.884 --> 18:40.553
but she kept calling me, begging
to see her one last time,

18:40.587 --> 18:41.721
to get "closure."

18:41.754 --> 18:44.457
So a couple weeks ago,
I went,

18:44.491 --> 18:46.426
and the crazy skank
got back at me

18:46.459 --> 18:49.162
by stuffing her panties
under my passenger seat.

18:49.196 --> 18:51.164
Of course,
my wife found them,

18:51.198 --> 18:53.600
and the you-know-what
hit the fan.

18:53.633 --> 18:56.436
Girl blowing up your marriage...

18:56.469 --> 18:58.538
Sounds like a decent motive
for murder.

18:58.571 --> 19:00.840
Aw, no. You kidding me?

19:00.873 --> 19:03.576
If anything, Tammy's little
stunt was a wake-up call.

19:03.610 --> 19:06.546
I mean, that and my
ball-buster of a prenup.

19:06.579 --> 19:09.549
I get caught cheating again,
my wife gets everything.

19:09.582 --> 19:10.617
Look,

19:10.650 --> 19:12.252
Tammy was bummed

19:12.285 --> 19:14.287
that she couldn't ride
the Forsythe Express anymore,

19:14.321 --> 19:16.623
but she was totes alive
when I left.

19:18.925 --> 19:20.560
(knock at door)

19:22.695 --> 19:25.465
Be right back.

19:30.570 --> 19:32.505
Please tell me
you got something.

19:32.539 --> 19:34.507
He's lying.

19:34.541 --> 19:35.775
Asshat parked in
a handicapped spot

19:35.808 --> 19:37.910
outside Tammy's apartment
the night of the murder.

19:37.944 --> 19:39.279
This says 10:45.

19:39.312 --> 19:41.748
Well within the window
for time of death.

19:41.781 --> 19:44.751
I'm sorry, who's
being played?

19:44.784 --> 19:46.686
Hmm?

19:46.719 --> 19:48.721
(Ruiz exhales)

19:54.361 --> 19:55.562
Ms. Morton.

19:55.595 --> 19:57.397
In the two and a half years you
were employed by AllSourcer,

19:57.430 --> 20:01.601
would you say the
company treated you well?

20:01.634 --> 20:03.636
Decent salary,
stock options...

20:03.670 --> 20:05.638
good selection of
snacks in the kitchen?

20:05.672 --> 20:07.940
They were very
generous, yes.

20:07.974 --> 20:11.644
So, in light of
all that generosity

20:11.678 --> 20:13.346
from the AllSourcer family,

20:13.380 --> 20:16.249
would you say you at all
feel guilty about jumping ship

20:16.283 --> 20:17.817
with millions of dollars'
worth of stolen IP?

20:17.850 --> 20:19.586
The "AllSourcer family"
wouldn't exist

20:19.619 --> 20:20.853
if Jeffrey Tanner hadn't put

20:20.887 --> 20:22.622
everything he had
into building it.

20:22.655 --> 20:24.657
And the IP was carved out
in the agreement.

20:24.691 --> 20:27.026
Given why he was leaving,

20:27.059 --> 20:29.796
it was too important to him
to leave to chance.

20:41.641 --> 20:42.742
Hi.

20:42.775 --> 20:44.711
Oh, hey.
Thanks for coming.

20:52.084 --> 20:54.421
Is this my doctoral thesis?

20:54.454 --> 20:55.755
Yeah.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.931
You ever meet her?

21:06.899 --> 21:08.435
Couple of times.

21:08.468 --> 21:11.738
She, um... she came by
my office once

21:11.771 --> 21:13.906
on her way
to lunch with you.

21:13.940 --> 21:15.775
And she brought me
a cup of tea.

21:15.808 --> 21:16.909
Hmm.

21:16.943 --> 21:18.345
Yeah.

21:28.888 --> 21:33.760
Do you... really believe
they convicted the wrong man?

21:33.793 --> 21:35.928
Carlos Ochoa?

21:35.962 --> 21:38.064
No, he didn't do it.

21:42.735 --> 21:45.772
But if that's true,
then...

21:45.805 --> 21:47.374
The killer is still out there.

21:47.407 --> 21:48.675
Somewhere.

21:48.708 --> 21:49.776
Do you have a theory
as to who...

21:49.809 --> 21:52.078
Not yet.

21:52.111 --> 21:54.914
But someone
has to know something.

21:54.947 --> 21:57.384
Someone has to
have seen something.

21:57.417 --> 21:59.786
Someone has to have
some scrap of information

21:59.819 --> 22:01.721
they didn't know they had.
I mean...

22:01.754 --> 22:03.923
the answers are out there,
you know?

22:03.956 --> 22:06.359
I just need some help.

22:08.961 --> 22:11.398
A lot of help.

22:11.431 --> 22:16.035
You want to crowdsource
a murder investigation?

22:16.068 --> 22:17.770
Am I crazy?

22:19.739 --> 22:21.774
Quite possibly, yes.

22:23.843 --> 22:28.381
But... there's only one way
to find out for certain.

22:39.492 --> 22:42.462
(Josh typing)

22:42.495 --> 22:43.996
We got something.

22:46.799 --> 22:48.000
Users have been focusing

22:48.034 --> 22:50.069
on Tammy's weight gain,
nausea, mood swings.

22:50.102 --> 22:51.771
First they thought
she was pregnant.

22:51.804 --> 22:53.039
That would've shown up
in the autopsy.

22:53.072 --> 22:54.173
Exactly, but then we posted

22:54.206 --> 22:55.442
the medical examiner's report,

22:55.475 --> 22:56.809
and another set of users

22:56.843 --> 22:59.412
noticed that Tammy had
elevated levels of hCG.

22:59.446 --> 23:00.747
What is that?

23:00.780 --> 23:02.849
Human chorionic gonadotropin.

23:02.882 --> 23:05.552
It's a hormone found
in pregnant women.
JOSH: But it's also a hormone

23:05.585 --> 23:08.755
that women inject when they're
undergoing fertility treatment.

23:08.788 --> 23:10.790
Which would explain the needles
in the bathroom.

23:10.823 --> 23:12.425
TARIQ:
Hey, look at this.

23:12.459 --> 23:14.126
I tracked one of Tammy's
digital wallet purchases

23:14.160 --> 23:16.763
to a website called
you-keep-him.com.

23:16.796 --> 23:18.097
Yeah, you heard that right.

23:18.130 --> 23:19.866
They market hCG injections

23:19.899 --> 23:21.868
as a way to fake
a positive pregnancy test.

23:21.901 --> 23:25.104
So you can baby-trap
your married boyfriend.

23:25.137 --> 23:27.106
I guess it didn't turn out
as she hoped.

23:27.139 --> 23:30.142
FORSYTHE: Okay, no, I wasn't
happy when she showed me

23:30.176 --> 23:32.011
the results of the
pregnancy test, but I thought

23:32.044 --> 23:34.013
she just wanted some money to
take care of it or something.

23:34.046 --> 23:36.583
Then she starts talking about
how we could "be a family."

23:36.616 --> 23:38.885
I have a family, okay?

23:38.918 --> 23:40.787
So you killed her.
No!

23:40.820 --> 23:41.988
God, no. No.

23:42.021 --> 23:44.591
Tammy was 100% alive

23:44.624 --> 23:46.493
when I left at 8:00,
just like I said.

23:46.526 --> 23:47.960
CAVANAUGH:
Then why was your car

23:47.994 --> 23:50.196
parked outside Tammy's
apartment at 10:45?

23:52.198 --> 23:54.567
Because parking
in the city sucks.

23:54.601 --> 23:57.003
Do you have any idea how hard
it is to find a well-lit spot

23:57.036 --> 23:59.138
in a neighborhood like that
after dark?

24:00.907 --> 24:02.842
All right.
(laughs): Okay, okay.

24:02.875 --> 24:05.111
Just...

24:05.144 --> 24:07.614
I left my car at Tammy's house

24:07.647 --> 24:10.049
and then I walked
to another friend's house.

24:10.082 --> 24:11.518
Okay?

24:11.551 --> 24:13.986
Another girlfriend.

24:16.022 --> 24:19.091
Can you please just
not tell my wife?

24:19.125 --> 24:21.561
It's hard to look this good
on a budget.

24:22.862 --> 24:25.231
Forsythe's story checks out.

24:25.264 --> 24:27.934
He was mixing margaritas
with girlfriend number two

24:27.967 --> 24:30.002
when Tammy was killed.

24:30.036 --> 24:32.672
Even got him on her building's
security camera.

24:32.705 --> 24:34.674
TANNER: What about other
suspects? He can't be the only

24:34.707 --> 24:36.075
angry ex.

24:36.108 --> 24:37.910
Tanner.
What?

24:37.944 --> 24:39.879
I'll run down
every suspect we find.

24:39.912 --> 24:41.914
But if Julia Guerrero
is guilty,

24:41.948 --> 24:43.149
I need you to know,

24:43.182 --> 24:44.884
I'm gonna put her away.

24:44.917 --> 24:47.119
Yeah, of course. Yeah.
(evidence alert beeping)

24:47.153 --> 24:48.254
I got to go.

24:50.657 --> 24:52.124
What's up?

24:52.158 --> 24:54.594
A couple of users saw the bike
on Julia's social media

24:54.627 --> 24:55.962
and then noticed
that it was parked

24:55.995 --> 24:57.229
a few blocks
from the apartment.

24:57.263 --> 24:59.632
"FutureMrsSheeran"
and "Eowynner411."

24:59.666 --> 25:01.033
Props on the Tolkien deep cut.

25:01.067 --> 25:02.669
They want to talk.
All right, patch them through.

25:03.970 --> 25:05.972
Hey, Sophe peeps, you're on

25:06.005 --> 25:08.908
with Donita and Rachel
from Crestview Arts Charter.

25:08.941 --> 25:10.610
Go Sparrows!
TARIQ: Okay,

25:10.643 --> 25:12.278
I love these kids.

25:12.311 --> 25:14.113
TANNER: Hey, girls.
Thank you for calling in.

25:14.146 --> 25:16.983
Are you, like, somebody's dad?

25:17.016 --> 25:18.918
(laughs)
Yeah, I'm
Jeffrey Tanner.

25:18.951 --> 25:20.319
I'm the head "Sophe peep."

25:20.352 --> 25:22.889
I need for you to step away
from the motorcycle

25:22.922 --> 25:24.223
and just wait for backup.

25:24.256 --> 25:26.993
Does Hermione wait for backup?

25:27.026 --> 25:28.728
Does Supergirl wait for backup?

25:28.761 --> 25:31.063
Uh, please don't
touch anything.

25:31.097 --> 25:33.966
Just, can you just step away
from the motorcycle...

25:34.000 --> 25:36.002
What is she doing?

25:39.305 --> 25:40.973
(gasps)

25:41.007 --> 25:42.975
Oh.
Ooh, we might need some backup.

25:43.009 --> 25:45.077
TANNER: Put the phone down.
I'm just calling Cavanaugh.

25:45.111 --> 25:47.146
No, no, no, no. Not until
we know something for sure.

25:47.179 --> 25:48.314
Girls, listen, don't
touch anything

25:48.347 --> 25:51.050
until I get there.

25:52.752 --> 25:54.320
Wait, where are you going?

25:54.353 --> 25:56.689
Listen, thank you
little lovely ladies so much.

25:56.723 --> 25:58.625
You've done a
wonderful job today.

25:58.658 --> 26:01.928
Great job.
Y'all should be giving us
some citizen detective award

26:01.961 --> 26:03.963
or something.
That is a fantastic idea.

26:03.996 --> 26:05.765
I'm gonna get with my team,
we're gonna get on that

26:05.798 --> 26:07.033
right away.
Thank you, guys.

26:07.066 --> 26:08.735
Wonderful username,
as well.

26:08.768 --> 26:10.336
The Tolkien-- I don't
know what it means,

26:10.369 --> 26:12.071
but thank you.

26:22.982 --> 26:25.351
Damn it, Julia.

26:29.789 --> 26:32.091
*

26:39.098 --> 26:41.801
(garbled radio transmission)

26:41.834 --> 26:43.670
(siren wailing)

26:45.905 --> 26:48.074
Sorry things
turned out like this.

26:48.107 --> 26:50.176
Yeah.

26:50.209 --> 26:52.712
Me, too.

26:54.246 --> 26:57.183
Is this your motorcycle?

26:57.216 --> 26:59.686
You know it is,
or you wouldn't be asking.

26:59.719 --> 27:03.089
We found this...

27:03.122 --> 27:04.791
in your saddlebag.

27:04.824 --> 27:07.860
(laughs)

27:07.894 --> 27:10.429
I should have seen
that one coming.

27:10.462 --> 27:14.801
You don't have any evidence,
so you haul off and plant some.

27:14.834 --> 27:16.202
RUIZ:
So are you claiming
the knife isn't yours?

27:16.235 --> 27:18.771
I'm claiming
I didn't kill Tammy.

27:20.206 --> 27:22.441
You know what?
Just take me to prison.

27:22.474 --> 27:25.845
Maybe in my next life, I'll
come back as a rich white girl.

27:25.878 --> 27:28.147
Well, I'll tell you
right now this much...
Julia, your uncle sent me.

27:28.180 --> 27:29.782
Uh, what the hell
are you doing, Tanner?

27:29.816 --> 27:32.251
I run a crime solving app
named "Sophe." Maybe

27:32.284 --> 27:34.320
you've heard of it?
Yeah, I heard of it. Bunch of

27:34.353 --> 27:36.322
pansy-ass nerds
playing detective.

27:36.355 --> 27:37.957
Yeah, well, last count there
were a couple hundred thousand

27:37.990 --> 27:39.792
of those nerds on the app.

27:39.826 --> 27:41.794
If you didn't kill Tammy,
they are

27:41.828 --> 27:43.362
your best chance
of getting free,

27:43.395 --> 27:45.364
but only if you tell the truth.

27:50.803 --> 27:52.972
(sighs softly)

27:53.005 --> 27:55.207
The night Tammy died,

27:55.241 --> 27:58.377
I had a gig as a
shot girl downtown.

27:58.410 --> 28:01.447
Then the damned manager fired me
for showing up high.

28:01.480 --> 28:03.315
To pass out Jell-O shots!

28:03.349 --> 28:04.851
That's like...

28:04.884 --> 28:07.386
What do you call it,
like, in English class?

28:07.419 --> 28:09.388
Irony.

28:09.421 --> 28:12.158
Yeah, that. Irony.

28:12.191 --> 28:15.828
Anyway, I get home, see Tammy

28:15.862 --> 28:17.964
left the front
door open again.

28:17.997 --> 28:19.866
Do you know what would happen

28:19.899 --> 28:22.902
if a person left the front door
open where I grew up?

28:25.271 --> 28:27.406
I mean,

28:27.439 --> 28:30.877
I guess she found out.

28:30.910 --> 28:32.745
Not gonna lie.

28:32.779 --> 28:35.882
I was high out of my mind.

28:41.020 --> 28:43.890
Then I was on the ground.

28:43.923 --> 28:48.327
At first, I couldn't figure out
why my clothes were wet.

28:50.229 --> 28:52.832
Then I saw her.

28:52.865 --> 28:55.534
Bitch looked pretty,

28:55.567 --> 28:58.370
even all cut up with the knife
sticking out of her.

28:58.404 --> 29:00.439
RUIZ:
Hold on.

29:00.472 --> 29:02.909
Are you saying the murder weapon
was in the apartment

29:02.942 --> 29:04.443
when you got there?

29:04.476 --> 29:06.979
I didn't touch
it, either.

29:07.013 --> 29:10.449
I knew what it would look like,
a girl like me, with my record.

29:10.482 --> 29:12.985
That's why I tried
to burn my clothes.

29:13.019 --> 29:15.021
Then the cops

29:15.054 --> 29:16.989
showed up.

29:17.023 --> 29:19.458
Time they perp-walked me
back through the apartment,

29:19.491 --> 29:22.294
knife was gone.

29:22.328 --> 29:23.963
I thought you guys had it.

29:26.298 --> 29:28.968
How much time was there
between the 911 call

29:29.001 --> 29:31.070
and when the cops
found Tammy's body?

29:31.103 --> 29:33.840
Nine minutes.
That's plenty of time

29:33.873 --> 29:36.809
for the killer
to come back, grab the knife.

29:36.843 --> 29:38.244
And it wouldn't
be hard for him

29:38.277 --> 29:40.479
to plant it in the motorcycle
after the fact.

29:40.512 --> 29:44.483
It's not likely, Tanner.

29:44.516 --> 29:46.352
But it is possible.

29:46.385 --> 29:48.888
I like possible.

29:51.924 --> 29:53.993
(phone buzzes)

29:54.026 --> 29:55.995
In his written statement,
Mr. Tanner claimed

29:56.028 --> 30:00.066
that the Sophe prototype wasn't
built on the AllSourcer campus.

30:01.133 --> 30:03.502
Um, it wasn't.

30:03.535 --> 30:08.307
Jeffrey acquired a new space
to work on Sophe.

30:08.340 --> 30:10.877
So you never borrowed
an AllSourcer mainframe?

30:10.910 --> 30:12.879
A cable? A stapler?

30:12.912 --> 30:14.847
I think we've
covered this.

30:14.881 --> 30:18.417
If you'd seen the state of the
place, you wouldn't be asking.

30:18.450 --> 30:23.522
The system is online,
and... we are...

30:23.555 --> 30:26.993
live with beta.

30:27.026 --> 30:28.560
Users?

30:28.594 --> 30:31.597
Um, 1,489 volunteers from a
variety of puzzle-solving sites.

30:31.630 --> 30:33.132
All right.

30:33.165 --> 30:37.069
Uh, what should we ask her?

30:37.103 --> 30:40.072
You decide.

30:42.174 --> 30:44.576
Um...

30:44.610 --> 30:47.113
Um...

30:52.484 --> 30:54.320
What did the...

30:54.353 --> 30:56.622
Island City company

30:56.655 --> 31:00.359
of Oakland,
California make?

31:00.392 --> 31:02.328
(computer trills)

31:09.435 --> 31:11.570
(beep)

31:11.603 --> 31:13.906
(gasps)

31:13.940 --> 31:15.641
(both laughing)
Oh, my God. Who knew?

31:15.674 --> 31:17.443
They knew.
Try another one.

31:19.478 --> 31:22.048
What year did
the Island City company open?

31:22.081 --> 31:24.383
(beeps)
And

31:24.416 --> 31:26.418
who was the company's
first owner?

31:28.154 --> 31:31.390
(beeping)

31:31.423 --> 31:32.658
TANNER:
Let's try something harder.

31:32.691 --> 31:34.160
These are my grandparents.

31:34.193 --> 31:36.362
He's a... he's a
handsome chap, isn't he?

31:36.395 --> 31:38.497
Yes, indeed.
Indeed he is.

31:38.530 --> 31:41.400
(phone whooshes)

31:41.433 --> 31:43.435
(computer trills)

31:43.469 --> 31:45.537
(beeps, Sara laughs)

31:45.571 --> 31:47.139
Oh.

31:47.173 --> 31:49.942
SARA:
This is amazing!
It's working.

31:49.976 --> 31:51.410
Well, it better
bloody work.

31:51.443 --> 31:53.679
I've spent years
building these algorithms.

31:53.712 --> 31:55.514
I mean, years.

31:55.547 --> 31:57.416
Wow.

31:57.449 --> 31:59.118
Um...

31:59.151 --> 32:00.953
I think we
should celebrate.
Yes.

32:00.987 --> 32:02.421
Yes?
Absolutely.

32:02.454 --> 32:03.655
Shall we?
Yes.

32:03.689 --> 32:05.391
I, uh...
(sighs)

32:05.424 --> 32:06.592
(clears throat)

32:06.625 --> 32:09.128
...I brought this,
just in case.

32:11.130 --> 32:12.498
It's actually
from Scotland.
Mmm.

32:12.531 --> 32:14.967
I hope you...
like Scotch.
Yes.

32:15.001 --> 32:17.669
Excellent choice.

32:17.703 --> 32:19.205
Well...

32:19.238 --> 32:21.407
Let's see...

32:24.543 --> 32:26.012
(exhales)

32:26.045 --> 32:28.414
Here's to Sophe.

32:30.116 --> 32:31.583
To Sophe.

32:54.140 --> 32:56.175
Uh, the prototype worked,

32:56.208 --> 33:00.746
and the rest is...
history.

33:00.779 --> 33:02.481
Can we have another
break, please?

33:02.514 --> 33:04.250
(sighs)

33:15.161 --> 33:16.762
(Nell clears throat)

33:16.795 --> 33:19.298
Here's the thing.
Everyone talks about Jeffrey

33:19.331 --> 33:21.267
as this great visionary,

33:21.300 --> 33:25.204
but we both know that Sophe
doesn't work without you.

33:25.237 --> 33:27.506
What do you want, Nell?

33:27.539 --> 33:28.674
I want you to
help us all out

33:28.707 --> 33:30.709
by making Jeffrey
see reason.

33:30.742 --> 33:34.513
I think you're greatly
overestimating my influence.

33:34.546 --> 33:37.216
What do you want
from your career

33:37.249 --> 33:39.651
over the next, say, ten years?

33:39.685 --> 33:41.487
Do you want to continue

33:41.520 --> 33:44.690
to play Gal Friday
to a man myopically concerned

33:44.723 --> 33:46.492
with solving a single mystery?

33:46.525 --> 33:50.729
Or would you like to be
heir-apparent to an empire?

33:53.532 --> 33:55.134
Here's the thing.

33:56.768 --> 33:58.837
AllSourcer may have

33:58.870 --> 34:01.740
a top-tier research budget,

34:01.773 --> 34:05.544
but Sophe has the ability
to harness the best impulses

34:05.577 --> 34:07.846
of the entire world--

34:07.879 --> 34:10.582
if, and only if,

34:10.616 --> 34:14.220
the world believes
our motives are genuine.

34:14.253 --> 34:16.622
Sophe isn't about empire.

34:16.655 --> 34:18.224
It's about community.
Now, if you'll excuse me...

34:18.257 --> 34:20.359
Sara...

34:20.392 --> 34:23.195
the rules aren't
the same for us.

34:23.229 --> 34:26.198
One false move, and the whole
world starts wondering

34:26.232 --> 34:27.233
if we got here

34:27.266 --> 34:29.235
because we're the best,

34:29.268 --> 34:32.538
or because we gave some man
in power what he needed.

34:45.651 --> 34:47.786
Any tips on Julia's bike?

34:47.819 --> 34:49.655
Oh, we have tons of tips.

34:49.688 --> 34:50.656
"Cut me off in traffic,"

34:50.689 --> 34:52.124
"Plays loud music,"
"Leaks oil."

34:52.158 --> 34:53.325
Is it weird that
she's growing on me?

34:53.359 --> 34:54.826
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.

34:56.728 --> 34:59.698
Hey.
Uh, nothing from the
traffic cams in the area.

34:59.731 --> 35:01.600
Damn it.
RUIZ:
I mean, in order for

35:01.633 --> 35:03.369
someone other than Julia
to have planted the knife,

35:03.402 --> 35:06.205
this person would have needed
access to the crime scene

35:06.238 --> 35:09.308
in the nine minutes
before SFPD got there.

35:09.341 --> 35:10.576
Like a guy who lives

35:10.609 --> 35:12.411
in the girl's building.

35:12.444 --> 35:14.280
Who parks his IT company van

35:14.313 --> 35:15.714
right across
from Julia's bike.

35:17.749 --> 35:19.418
The building manager.

35:19.451 --> 35:20.819
Yeah.

35:20.852 --> 35:23.322
We need to pay
this guy a visit.

35:25.257 --> 35:27.326
(cell phone ringing)

35:29.861 --> 35:32.298
Hello?

35:32.331 --> 35:33.332
WOMAN: (over phone):
Sara Morton?

35:33.365 --> 35:35.434
Speaking.
Who is this?

35:35.467 --> 35:37.169
Hi, Sara,
it's Mary Beth D'Agostino

35:37.203 --> 35:40.439
from BayAreaCelebs.com.
Do you have a moment?

35:40.472 --> 35:41.840
Um, I'm kind of busy,
actually.

35:41.873 --> 35:43.609
Uh, what's this about?

35:43.642 --> 35:46.178
Oh, it's okay, I'll just
text over the photographs.

35:46.212 --> 35:47.879
Let me know if you want
to comment.

35:47.913 --> 35:50.349
I'm sure our subscribers
would love to hear

35:50.382 --> 35:51.883
your side of the story.

35:51.917 --> 35:53.319
Story? What story?

35:53.352 --> 35:55.221
Hel...
(phone chimes)

35:55.254 --> 35:58.190
(chiming)

36:12.738 --> 36:15.741
Officers, can I help you?

36:15.774 --> 36:17.409
I think you can.
Can we come in?

36:17.443 --> 36:19.177
Um, okay.

36:32.891 --> 36:35.427
You take all
these pictures?

36:35.461 --> 36:38.497
Ah, I dabble.
You dabble.

36:38.530 --> 36:41.533
Looks like you do
more than dabble.

36:41.567 --> 36:44.370
May I?
That's professional grade.

36:44.403 --> 36:47.273
Almost incomprehensible
to the layperson.

36:55.981 --> 36:57.549
You've got some pretty
intimate images here, Kenneth.

36:57.583 --> 36:59.518
Does Tammy know you dabble
through her window?

36:59.551 --> 37:02.254
I... I can explain.

37:02.288 --> 37:03.789
Can you?

37:03.822 --> 37:06.992
CAVANAUGH: She was gonna
call the cops, wasn't she?

37:07.025 --> 37:08.494
(grunts)

37:12.898 --> 37:15.467
TANNER:
"Did Sophe's Top Woman..."
What the hell?

37:15.501 --> 37:18.537
You know that this was Nell.

37:18.570 --> 37:21.540
She hired a PI to catch me
breaking my restraining order.

37:21.573 --> 37:22.841
I am sorry.

37:22.874 --> 37:23.575
I know this is awful.

37:23.609 --> 37:25.010
Like an idiot,
I set myself up

37:25.043 --> 37:27.012
by sleeping with my boss.

37:28.880 --> 37:30.349
TANNER:
It's not your fault.

37:30.382 --> 37:31.450
(Sara sighs)

37:31.483 --> 37:32.751
SARA:
They are all reading it.

37:32.784 --> 37:33.885
aren't they?

37:33.919 --> 37:36.588
Right.

37:36.622 --> 37:38.490
Might as well
get this over with, then.

37:41.860 --> 37:43.762
Everyone...

37:43.795 --> 37:46.565
can I have your attention
for a moment, please?

37:46.598 --> 37:52.003
I'm sure you have all seen
the article by now.

37:52.037 --> 37:54.773
Well, it's true.

37:54.806 --> 37:57.943
As the Internet
so eloquently put it,

37:57.976 --> 38:00.812
Jeffery and I
have been banging

38:00.846 --> 38:02.581
for five months now.

38:02.614 --> 38:04.783
More than banging.

38:04.816 --> 38:07.819
I'm actually...
incredibly into her.

38:09.955 --> 38:13.058
Um, I know that this

38:13.091 --> 38:15.427
must seem surprising.

38:15.461 --> 38:16.828
TARIQ:
Yeah, not really.

38:16.862 --> 38:17.996
Yeah, it's just that
all the walls here

38:18.029 --> 38:19.365
are made of glass, so...

38:19.398 --> 38:20.832
We can see through
your offices.

38:20.866 --> 38:22.000
Yeah, it's like
a big fishbowl.

38:22.033 --> 38:24.870
Right.
You're great
at your job,

38:24.903 --> 38:26.104
and we love you.

38:26.137 --> 38:27.606
(laughs)

38:27.639 --> 38:30.008
Promotion for Rosie.

38:30.041 --> 38:31.543
Kidding, of course.

38:31.577 --> 38:34.946
There are performance
reviews for that.

38:34.980 --> 38:39.985
So, anyway, thank you,
and carry on. Good.

38:46.925 --> 38:49.094
I think they took that well.

38:49.127 --> 38:50.929
They did.

38:50.962 --> 38:52.498
They're not the ones
I'm worried about.

38:52.531 --> 38:53.899
Look, Sara, this...
No, wait, wait.

38:53.932 --> 38:55.133
Let me get this...
let me get this out.

38:55.166 --> 38:57.569
Um...

38:58.970 --> 39:00.906
...about what I said earlier.

39:00.939 --> 39:03.875
The, uh...
the marriage thing.

39:05.577 --> 39:07.913
Nope, don't remember
any of it.

39:07.946 --> 39:09.881
None of it.

39:11.717 --> 39:13.519
It's not that I
don't love you, Jeffrey,

39:13.552 --> 39:18.690
or that I can't picture
a future together with you.

39:18.724 --> 39:22.561
It's... it's because
of Melinda Gates.

39:22.594 --> 39:24.663
Melinda Gates?

39:24.696 --> 39:27.032
Do you know what
Melinda Gates did

39:27.065 --> 39:29.067
before she married Bill?

39:31.136 --> 39:32.438
No.

39:32.471 --> 39:35.106
Neither does anyone else.

39:35.140 --> 39:37.443
After all the good
that she's done,

39:37.476 --> 39:38.544
all that she's accomplished...

39:38.577 --> 39:40.446
The woman has
literally saved

39:40.479 --> 39:42.981
thousands of lives,

39:43.014 --> 39:45.183
and the world will
always remember her

39:45.216 --> 39:48.153
as Bill Gates' helpmate.

39:50.989 --> 39:52.991
I'm sorry.

39:53.024 --> 39:55.594
I truly am.

39:55.627 --> 39:57.896
(chuckles)

39:57.929 --> 40:00.932
I-I-I don't even
know how to help.

40:03.735 --> 40:06.037
Finish the case,
that's how.

40:07.606 --> 40:12.143
The best revenge is
a platform that works.

40:12.177 --> 40:14.913
Well, that and a flaming
bag of dog crap

40:14.946 --> 40:16.715
on Nell DeGraf's front porch.

40:16.748 --> 40:18.750
Now, that I can
definitely arrange.

40:18.784 --> 40:21.720
(laughing)
Yeah, no, I know
just the dog.

40:21.753 --> 40:23.922
He will do such a nice job.

40:26.057 --> 40:28.727
You know, you could be
real pretty if you wanted.

40:28.760 --> 40:31.997
A little more makeup,
maybe some gold hoops.

40:32.030 --> 40:33.465
(chuckles)

40:34.500 --> 40:38.937
Anyway, uh,
fight the power.

40:40.606 --> 40:41.740
Do the right thing.

40:44.075 --> 40:45.777
Think she got that?
Probably not.

40:45.811 --> 40:48.747
(both laugh)
Look, um,

40:48.780 --> 40:51.182
thanks for going down
this road with me.

40:51.216 --> 40:52.784
You didn't have to.

40:52.818 --> 40:55.153
What did we say the first day
we worked together?

40:56.622 --> 40:59.090
Partners always have
each other's backs.

40:59.124 --> 41:01.560
Yeah.
Even when one of them

41:01.593 --> 41:03.228
is totally being played.

41:05.764 --> 41:07.766
Really?

41:07.799 --> 41:10.802
Hey, look, man, my mom calls me
about a month ago, right?

41:10.836 --> 41:11.703
She tells me five grand

41:11.737 --> 41:14.573
just shows up on the porch
out of nowhere.

41:14.606 --> 41:16.274
Couple days later, some guy
comes in here in a suit,

41:16.307 --> 41:17.408
claiming to be my lawyer.

41:17.442 --> 41:19.811
This dude knows everything
about the porch money, right?

41:19.845 --> 41:21.079
And he tells me straight up

41:21.112 --> 41:22.814
there's a lot more
where that came from.

41:22.848 --> 41:26.718
But all I got to do is keep
an eye out on this new fish.

41:26.752 --> 41:28.554
Carlos Ochoa.
Right, right.

41:28.587 --> 41:31.557
If he says anything
about Mia Tanner's killer...

41:31.590 --> 41:32.991
"Mia Tanner's killer."

41:33.024 --> 41:34.593
That's what he said?

41:34.626 --> 41:36.628
Yeah, yeah. I mean,
you gonna X a dude out, man,

41:36.662 --> 41:38.730
you got to be clear
about the details, right?

41:38.764 --> 41:41.099
I hear Ochoa-- he's telling
someone else on the phone

41:41.132 --> 41:42.601
that he might know
who killed her.

41:43.669 --> 41:44.703
So I stuck him.

41:44.736 --> 41:46.137
Who? Who killed her?

41:46.171 --> 41:48.273
I mean, come on, come on,
hell if I know, all right?

41:48.306 --> 41:51.810
Okay... The gu...
the-the guy in the suit

41:51.843 --> 41:53.011
that came to see you--

41:53.044 --> 41:54.312
what was his name?

41:54.345 --> 41:56.047
What... wh-what
did he look like?

41:56.081 --> 41:57.148
Anything.
I don't know, man,

41:57.182 --> 41:59.851
he's just some guy
in a suit. Oh.

41:59.885 --> 42:01.219
I'll tell you
what I do remember.

42:03.188 --> 42:05.056
This guy came in
on a Thursday, though.

42:05.090 --> 42:06.858
Couple weeks on the loaf,
you know what I mean?

42:06.892 --> 42:08.293
Hey, mashed-potato Thursdays
are better

42:08.326 --> 42:10.195
than beer and ice cream, right?

42:10.228 --> 42:11.597
Huh?

42:13.098 --> 42:15.601
Okay, I got it. Fine.

42:15.634 --> 42:17.603
The driver's license
of our visitor was bogus.

42:17.636 --> 42:19.204
Ditto with the bar card.

42:19.237 --> 42:20.839
And now we know for sure
there's more to the story.

42:20.872 --> 42:22.841
The cops were wrong.
I mean, I could've

42:22.874 --> 42:24.876
told you that before, but...
Dude, he's standing right here.

42:24.910 --> 42:28.179
Yeah, he is. And he has
new evidence for you.

42:28.213 --> 42:32.150
So my buddy at Vacaville
sent us the sign-in footage.

42:32.183 --> 42:36.121
Flaco's "lawyer" wasn't
too careful with the cameras.

42:38.690 --> 42:41.860
Someone out there has to know
something about this guy.

42:41.893 --> 42:44.062
Post it.
