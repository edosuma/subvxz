WEBVTT

00:04.088 --> 00:06.613
The tuxedo is a woman's view
that men are all the same.

00:06.790 --> 00:08.724
We might as well
dress them that way.

00:09.593 --> 00:13.461
To me, a wedding is the joining
together of a beautiful, glowing bride...

00:13.631 --> 00:15.189
...and some guy.

00:15.900 --> 00:19.461
The tuxedo is a wedding safety
device, created by women...

00:19.637 --> 00:21.696
...because they know that men
are undependable.

00:22.006 --> 00:23.633
So in case the groom chickens out...

00:23.807 --> 00:27.004
...everybody takes one step over,
and she marries the next guy.

00:27.378 --> 00:30.347
That's why the wedding vow isn't,
"Do you take Bill Simpson?"

00:30.514 --> 00:32.539
It's, "Do you take this man?"

00:38.656 --> 00:40.590
Leave a message.
I'll call you back. Thanks.

00:40.824 --> 00:44.351
Jerry? Joe Davola.

00:47.231 --> 00:49.825
I have a hair on my tongue.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.297
Can't get it off.

00:51.468 --> 00:53.459
You know how much I hate that?

00:53.737 --> 00:56.865
Of course you do.
You put it there.

00:57.041 --> 00:59.009
I know what you said about me,
Seinfeld.

00:59.176 --> 01:02.202
I know you bad-mouthed me
to the execs at NBC.

01:02.379 --> 01:04.904
Put the kibosh on my deal.

01:05.081 --> 01:08.051
Now I'm gonna put the kibosh on you.

01:08.586 --> 01:10.520
You know I've kiboshed before.

01:11.188 --> 01:14.123
And I will kibosh again.

01:20.664 --> 01:22.757
- So, what do you think?
- About what?

01:22.967 --> 01:24.935
- About the opera.
- I don't wanna go.

01:25.102 --> 01:27.400
- You gotta go.
- I don't like the opera.

01:27.571 --> 01:30.369
What are they singing for?
Who sings?

01:30.708 --> 01:33.233
You got something to say, say it.

01:33.911 --> 01:36.379
You don't understand.
That's the way they talk in Italy.

01:36.547 --> 01:38.606
They sing to one another.

01:45.122 --> 01:46.350
All right. All right.

01:46.523 --> 01:48.616
That's their way.
You listen to the language.

01:48.792 --> 01:50.987
It's got that sing-songy quality to it.

01:51.161 --> 01:53.459
It's the language, Jerry.
The language.

01:53.931 --> 01:57.560
- So why don't they talk like that now?
- It's too hard to keep up.

01:57.735 --> 02:00.329
You know, they got...
They were tired.

02:01.338 --> 02:02.635
- Better get that.
- Yeah.

02:02.806 --> 02:04.933
- It's me.
- Come on up.

02:05.109 --> 02:07.339
- So?
- I don't know.

02:07.511 --> 02:11.971
Come on. It's opening night.
Black-tie, Pagliacci. The great clown.

02:12.149 --> 02:15.312
The great, sad, tragic clown,
like you.

02:16.887 --> 02:19.014
Well, that's very flattering.

02:19.189 --> 02:21.316
How'd you get tickets?
They're impossible to get.

02:21.492 --> 02:23.551
Well, I have many associates.

02:24.828 --> 02:26.921
I don't know.
Opera, it's not my kind of thing.

02:27.131 --> 02:29.190
Then I'm gonna call
the whole thing off.

02:29.366 --> 02:31.994
Wait a minute. What about
George, Susan and Elaine?

02:32.169 --> 02:34.194
- Why do you need me?
- You're the nucleus...

02:34.371 --> 02:37.772
...the straw that stirs the drink.
You're the "magliana."

02:38.042 --> 02:40.533
I guess if I'm the magliana,
I should go.

02:40.711 --> 02:42.542
All right. All right.

02:42.713 --> 02:44.010
- Good.
- Hey.

02:44.181 --> 02:45.409
You got the tickets, right?

02:45.582 --> 02:49.245
- No, I don't have them on me.
- What? That's why I came over here.

02:49.420 --> 02:51.547
My friend's got them.
I'll pick them up tomorrow.

02:51.722 --> 02:55.852
I was gonna surprise Joey with them.
You got an extra one, right?

02:56.026 --> 02:57.493
Oh, yeah!

02:57.661 --> 03:02.223
So I finally get to meet
your pal Joey.

03:02.800 --> 03:04.825
- It's killing you, isn't it?
- Yeah.

03:05.002 --> 03:08.130
So Joey's a great lover of the opera.

03:08.305 --> 03:10.296
Listen...

03:11.041 --> 03:12.474
...I got news for you.

03:12.643 --> 03:14.474
It's nice to be involved
with somebody...

03:14.645 --> 03:17.478
...who's interested in something
other than Nick at Nite.

03:19.483 --> 03:21.383
You know, he's got a grip on reality.

03:21.552 --> 03:24.885
He's... He's happy. He's well-adjusted.

03:26.000 --> 03:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:34.631 --> 03:36.030
Looking forward to meeting him.

03:36.200 --> 03:37.827
I gotta go.

03:38.435 --> 03:39.663
Where? What's the rush?

03:39.837 --> 03:41.896
To surprise Joey.
I've never been to his place.

03:42.072 --> 03:45.007
- I'm just gonna pop in.
- Good, men love that.

03:47.644 --> 03:49.043
Hey.

03:50.514 --> 03:52.243
You got a message, buddy.

03:52.416 --> 03:53.906
It could be from that blond.

03:57.488 --> 04:00.480
Jerry? Joe Davola.

04:02.659 --> 04:04.183
I have a hair on my tongue.

04:11.468 --> 04:13.959
What am I gonna do?
He's gonna put the kibosh on me.

04:14.138 --> 04:18.096
- He's crazy, out of his mind!
- Steady, steady! Now, calm yourself!

04:18.274 --> 04:21.244
He's supposed to be on medication.
He told me he was on medication.

04:21.411 --> 04:24.039
- What happened to his medication?
- Quiet! Now let me think.

04:24.448 --> 04:27.144
I'm gonna call the cops.
That's what I'm doing. The cops.

04:27.384 --> 04:29.352
Why?! They're not gonna
do anything!

04:29.520 --> 04:31.351
They're the cops.
They gotta do something.

04:31.522 --> 04:34.457
He'll put the kibosh on me. Do you
know what it is to be kiboshed?

04:35.659 --> 04:38.890
- Kibosh.
- It's a terrible mistake.

04:39.062 --> 04:42.463
He thinks I ruined some deal at NBC.
I don't know anything about it.

04:42.633 --> 04:45.966
- Call and tell him that.
- That... That's what I'll do.

04:46.136 --> 04:50.163
I'll just call him and tell him.
That's all I'll do. Right.

04:50.474 --> 04:53.966
He's a human being.
I'll talk to him. He'll understand, right?

04:54.144 --> 04:55.907
Yeah.

04:56.079 --> 04:57.478
Don't mention my name.

05:00.818 --> 05:03.150
Oh, I got the machine.

05:03.320 --> 05:05.845
- What's his message like?
- Nice.

05:06.223 --> 05:08.123
Hello, Joe. Listen,
this is Jerry Seinfeld.

05:08.292 --> 05:11.955
I think there's been a huge, colossal
misunderstanding.

05:12.129 --> 05:14.723
Big. Big.

05:14.898 --> 05:17.298
If we could just talk,
we could straighten this out...

05:17.467 --> 05:20.265
...so call me back. Bye.

05:23.574 --> 05:25.098
Joey?

05:26.009 --> 05:27.772
Joey?

05:46.463 --> 05:50.194
Oh, God. It's you. You scared me.

05:50.367 --> 05:53.063
Good. Fear's our most
primal emotion.

05:55.205 --> 05:56.900
You left your door open.

05:57.107 --> 05:59.701
I know. I like to encourage intruders.

06:04.781 --> 06:05.907
What is all this?

06:06.083 --> 06:07.345
Do you like it?

06:07.517 --> 06:11.476
My home is a shrine to you.

06:12.222 --> 06:13.951
Where did you get all these pictures?

06:14.124 --> 06:17.116
I took them myself
with a telephoto lens.

06:17.928 --> 06:20.658
Coming out of your office,
your apartment.

06:20.931 --> 06:22.523
Shopping.

06:22.699 --> 06:24.257
Showering.

06:25.869 --> 06:28.394
Showering?

06:28.572 --> 06:30.301
I develop them myself
in my darkroom.

06:30.474 --> 06:32.669
Would you...? Would you like to see?

06:33.944 --> 06:36.742
In the darkroom?
Oh, no, thank you.

06:36.914 --> 06:39.144
Not right now.

06:39.316 --> 06:42.342
I'm a day person.

06:46.590 --> 06:48.820
Are...? Are you all right?

06:49.259 --> 06:50.920
Why?

06:51.528 --> 06:54.725
Well, I don't know.
You just don't...

06:54.898 --> 06:57.765
...seem yourself.
- Who am I?

06:58.969 --> 07:02.097
- Who am I supposed to be?
- That's a good question.

07:02.272 --> 07:05.799
Good question. It's very existential.

07:05.976 --> 07:09.537
Who are you? Who am I?
Well...

07:10.147 --> 07:11.375
What are you doing here?

07:11.548 --> 07:14.278
Oh, nothing. I just stopped by
to chat.

07:14.451 --> 07:16.783
You know, shoot the breeze.

07:16.954 --> 07:20.082
Were you able to get those Pagliacci
opera tickets from your friend?

07:20.257 --> 07:21.986
I'm really looking forward to it.

07:24.494 --> 07:28.055
No, he couldn't get them.
We're not going.

07:28.598 --> 07:30.088
Really?

07:32.436 --> 07:35.769
Oh, damn it.
I just remembered I gotta go.

07:35.939 --> 07:40.569
I left something on. The gas,
the lights, the water in the tub.

07:40.744 --> 07:43.611
Something is on somewhere,
so I'm just gonna get the...

07:45.716 --> 07:48.708
Do you know the story of Pagliacci,
Nedda?

07:49.987 --> 07:51.545
I'm Elaine.

07:51.755 --> 07:54.690
He's a clown whose wife
is unfaithful to him.

07:56.393 --> 07:59.294
Do you think I'm a clown, Nedda?

08:00.163 --> 08:04.099
Do I think you're a clown?
No. Not if it's bad to be a clown.

08:04.267 --> 08:08.226
If it's bad to be a clown, then
you are definitely not a clown.

08:08.405 --> 08:13.308
But if it's good to be a clown, then I
would have to rethink the whole thing.

08:14.111 --> 08:16.875
You've betrayed me with another,
haven't you, Nedda?

08:17.047 --> 08:19.174
Who is he? I want you
to tell me who he is.

08:19.349 --> 08:21.647
I want his name. Tell me his name.

08:21.818 --> 08:25.413
Oh, like any man would
ever look at me. Come on.

08:25.589 --> 08:27.784
I'm gonna get out of here.

08:27.958 --> 08:29.926
Pagliacci kills his wife.

08:30.093 --> 08:33.585
See? Now that's terrible. That is...
That's not a nice thing to do at all.

08:33.764 --> 08:37.393
I would assume... I don't know how
this Pagliacci thing turns out.

08:37.567 --> 08:41.525
But I would assume that there was
big, big trouble for that clown.

08:41.871 --> 08:43.100
You're not leaving.

08:49.046 --> 08:50.843
But, officer, he threatened me.

08:51.014 --> 08:52.606
I don't understand.
That's not right.

08:52.783 --> 08:56.150
What if it was the president
of the U.S.? I bet you'd investigate.

08:56.319 --> 09:00.187
So, what's the difference?
I'm a comedian of the United States.

09:00.624 --> 09:03.388
And I'll tell you, I'm under
just as much pressure.

09:03.827 --> 09:07.092
All right. Thanks anyway.
Okay, bye.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.860
- Who is it?
- It's George.

09:16.840 --> 09:19.707
- You're locking the door now?
- Yeah.

09:29.986 --> 09:31.749
Well, well. Look at you.

09:33.390 --> 09:36.052
It's a little skimpy there, isn't it?

09:37.627 --> 09:39.891
You know the last time
I wore this thing?

09:40.063 --> 09:41.291
Six years ago.

09:41.465 --> 09:43.763
When I made that toast
at Bobby Leighton's wedding.

09:43.934 --> 09:46.027
Oh, that was a bad toast.

09:46.203 --> 09:47.602
It wasn't that bad.

09:47.771 --> 09:50.296
I never heard anybody curse
in a toast.

09:51.041 --> 09:53.032
I was trying to loosen them up
a little bit.

09:53.210 --> 09:54.939
There were old people there.

09:55.112 --> 09:59.071
All the relatives.
You were like a Redd Foxx record.

09:59.850 --> 10:02.045
At the end of the toast,
nobody even drank.

10:02.219 --> 10:04.983
They were just standing. They were
just frozen. People...

10:06.089 --> 10:09.286
That might have been
one of the worst all-time toasts.

10:09.459 --> 10:12.690
Still, her father didn't have
to throw me out like that.

10:12.863 --> 10:15.297
He could've asked me to leave.
He had me in a headlock.

10:16.700 --> 10:18.133
Susan's not going tonight.

10:18.535 --> 10:20.162
What do you mean, not going?
Why not?

10:20.337 --> 10:22.532
She had to pick up a friend
at the airport.

10:22.706 --> 10:24.537
It cost me $ 100, this ticket.

10:24.708 --> 10:27.472
- Why didn't she pay for hers?
- That's a very good question.

10:28.111 --> 10:30.909
She and I go to dinner,
she doesn't even reach for the check.

10:31.081 --> 10:33.743
All I'm asking for is a reach.
Is that so much to ask for?

10:33.917 --> 10:35.578
It's nice to get a reach.

10:39.055 --> 10:41.819
- Who is it?
- It's me!

10:43.026 --> 10:45.494
Why are you locking the door now?

10:45.996 --> 10:47.395
Because of Davola.
Get in here.

10:47.564 --> 10:49.532
What the...?

10:51.468 --> 10:53.993
- How come you're not dressed?
- I am dressed.

10:54.171 --> 10:56.969
- You're going like this?
- Yeah. I want you to hear something.

10:57.140 --> 11:01.270
- You said people dress up for opera.
- Well, people do. I don't.

11:02.913 --> 11:05.381
If you're going like that,
I'm not going like this.

11:05.549 --> 11:09.007
Wait a minute! Do you think
I'm comfortable here?

11:09.419 --> 11:11.580
I can't change. I got no clothes here.

11:11.755 --> 11:14.019
You gotta go like that.
I can't go like this alone.

11:14.191 --> 11:17.058
Why should I be uncomfortable
because my apartment is closer?

11:17.227 --> 11:19.286
That's not the issue. We're friends.

11:19.462 --> 11:21.453
If I gotta be uncomfortable,
you gotta too.

11:21.631 --> 11:25.032
All right. I'll wear this. It's bad enough
I gotta go to the opera...

11:25.202 --> 11:28.000
...I gotta sit next to Ozzie Nelson
over here.

11:28.305 --> 11:30.967
Would you turn that down?
What is that crap?

11:31.141 --> 11:32.870
It's Pagliacci.

11:33.043 --> 11:34.533
Oh, beautiful.

11:34.711 --> 11:37.179
We got a little problem here.
We got two extra tickets.

11:37.347 --> 11:39.542
- Why, what happened?
- Susan isn't going...

11:39.716 --> 11:43.652
...and Elaine's friend isn't going.
- Fantastic. We'll scalp the tickets.

11:43.820 --> 11:46.380
We can make maybe 500 a ticket.

11:46.556 --> 11:47.989
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

11:48.158 --> 11:50.683
People are looking for tickets here?

11:51.261 --> 11:55.891
Are you kidding? Opening night,
Pavarotti in Pagliacci?

11:56.066 --> 11:59.160
- We're gonna clean up.
- Oh, man, I knew I'd love the opera.

11:59.336 --> 12:02.669
- Yeah, right.
- Come on, let's go get the tickets.

12:02.839 --> 12:05.706
Listen, I gotta wait for Elaine.
I'll meet you at the theater.

12:05.875 --> 12:07.706
- All right, yeah.
- Isn't scalping illegal?

12:07.877 --> 12:09.708
Oh, yeah.

12:26.429 --> 12:30.422
You sprayed him in the eyes
with Binaca?

12:33.003 --> 12:35.471
Cherry Binaca. It's new.

12:35.805 --> 12:38.330
See, I don't get that.
First they come out with regular.

12:38.508 --> 12:39.941
A year later, they have cherry.

12:40.110 --> 12:43.341
They know we like cherry. Start with
cherry. Then come out with regular.

12:43.813 --> 12:46.646
It was like I didn't know him.
He was a different person.

12:46.916 --> 12:48.850
You should hear the message
from my nut.

12:49.586 --> 12:52.521
Where's George and Kramer?
I wanna get inside already.

12:52.689 --> 12:54.680
I feel very vulnerable.

12:55.625 --> 12:57.092
What you doing?
That's my quarter.

12:57.260 --> 13:00.457
- No, it's not. It's mine.
- I was just flipping it. That's mine.

13:00.630 --> 13:01.961
No, I dropped it. It's mine.

13:02.132 --> 13:05.465
All right, you want it, take it,
but don't try and tell me it's yours.

13:05.635 --> 13:07.068
Well, it is mine.

13:07.504 --> 13:09.199
What, you think I care
about the money?

13:09.372 --> 13:11.067
Is that what you think? I'll show you.

13:11.241 --> 13:12.902
Look at this. Here's a dollar. Look.

13:13.076 --> 13:14.600
That's how much
I care about money.

13:14.778 --> 13:18.111
You think I care about money.
That's how much I care about money.

13:18.315 --> 13:20.146
- Why don't you get lost?
- Why don't you?

13:20.317 --> 13:22.376
- Because I was standing here.
- Oh, yeah?

13:22.552 --> 13:24.144
Yeah.

13:28.591 --> 13:31.560
I kind of like this opera crowd.
I feel tough.

13:34.264 --> 13:36.892
Anybody else got a problem?

13:40.403 --> 13:42.234
- Hey, clown.
- Clown.

13:42.806 --> 13:44.671
Make us laugh, clown.

13:44.841 --> 13:47.332
- Nice face, clown.
- Make me laugh, clown.

13:55.051 --> 13:57.576
I got two. I got two. Pagliacci.

13:57.754 --> 14:00.382
Who needs Pagliacci, huh?
Come on, the great tragic clown.

14:00.557 --> 14:03.685
Come on, check it out. He laughs,
he cries, he sings. Pagliacci.

14:03.860 --> 14:06.226
I got two beauties right here.
Check it out.

14:06.396 --> 14:08.330
- All right.
- Hey, hey, you selling?

14:08.498 --> 14:10.022
I'm selling.

14:10.200 --> 14:13.727
- Where are they?
- Orchestra, row G, dead center. Primo.

14:13.903 --> 14:16.269
You think you died
and went to heaven.

14:16.439 --> 14:17.667
What do you want for them?

14:17.841 --> 14:20.207
I'll tell you what I'll do.
You look like a nice guy.

14:20.477 --> 14:22.308
A thousand dollars for the deuce.

14:22.912 --> 14:25.210
- Give you $500 for the pair.
- Yeah. It's a deal.

14:25.382 --> 14:27.907
- No.
- What, no? Are you crazy?

14:28.084 --> 14:31.383
- Look, let me handle this.
- That's $500. That's a great deal.

14:31.554 --> 14:33.488
You're blowing it.
The guy's a pigeon.

14:33.656 --> 14:37.752
Oh, God, see, he's walking away.
What is wrong with you?

14:37.927 --> 14:39.792
That was a $300 profit.

14:39.963 --> 14:41.624
I know what I'm doing here, George.

14:41.798 --> 14:44.892
This is not a Metallica concert.
It's an opera, all right?

14:45.068 --> 14:47.468
A little dignity. A little class.
Give me my ticket.

14:47.637 --> 14:49.332
I will stand over here and sell it.

14:49.506 --> 14:51.701
Thank you. Stand over there.
I'll stand over here.

14:51.875 --> 14:53.900
- I know where I'm standing.
- All right.

14:54.077 --> 14:56.602
- Get your Pagliaccis here!
- Pagliaccis right here, huh?

14:57.046 --> 14:58.707
Where are they already?

14:58.882 --> 15:01.077
I guarantee you they don't
sell those tickets.

15:01.317 --> 15:04.650
Hey, look. There's Bobby Leighton's
father-in-law. Mr. Reichman.

15:04.821 --> 15:06.846
George and I were just talking
about him.

15:07.390 --> 15:09.085
He threw George out of the wedding.

15:09.459 --> 15:11.757
Oh, yeah, when George
made that bad toast.

15:11.928 --> 15:15.261
- You remember the curse toast?
- Oh, yeah. The curse toast.

15:15.465 --> 15:16.796
Can you believe that message?

15:16.966 --> 15:19.196
I gotta spend my life looking
over my shoulder.

15:19.369 --> 15:21.234
Me too.

15:22.338 --> 15:25.364
Crazy Joe Davola.

15:26.276 --> 15:28.870
- How do you know his name?
- Why wouldn't I know his name?

15:29.279 --> 15:31.941
- I never told you his name.
- I never told you his name.

15:32.782 --> 15:34.977
- Who are we talking about here?
- Joe Davola.

15:35.151 --> 15:37.483
Right, Joe Davola.

15:38.221 --> 15:39.779
How do you know his name?

15:40.356 --> 15:44.725
I've been out with him three times.
I should know the man's name.

15:45.395 --> 15:48.296
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- He's stalking you?

15:48.465 --> 15:50.626
- Are you kidding me?
- You're dating the madman...

15:50.800 --> 15:53.701
...who's trying to kill me?
- Why didn't you tell me his name?

15:53.870 --> 15:55.997
Last night he accused me
of seeing someone else.

15:56.172 --> 15:58.470
- He said, "Tell me his name!"
- He said that?

15:58.641 --> 16:00.700
If he sees us, can you imagine
what he'll do?

16:00.877 --> 16:03.311
If he thinks I ruined his NBC deal
and stole his girl!

16:03.480 --> 16:06.415
- That will be a kibosh for sure.
- What about me?

16:06.583 --> 16:08.175
Excuse me.

16:08.818 --> 16:11.252
Come on. This is Pavarotti.

16:11.621 --> 16:14.055
Three hundred dollars.
That's a lot of money.

16:14.224 --> 16:17.284
Steven Holtzman did a production
in Tunis last year.

16:17.460 --> 16:21.021
From what I understand,
the Muslims really took to it.

16:21.364 --> 16:25.266
I'll tell you what. You seem like a
nice guy. Let's stop jerking around.

16:25.702 --> 16:29.934
Give me $250. I got people waiting
for me. I gotta get the hell out of here.

16:30.206 --> 16:33.073
Scalping. I told them
to put on extra security.

16:33.243 --> 16:34.676
Excuse me.

16:35.011 --> 16:37.673
Pop, would you buzz off?
I got something cooking here.

16:37.847 --> 16:40.042
- Costanza?
- Mr. Reichman?

16:40.216 --> 16:42.275
Still a sewer-mouth.
Give me those tickets.

16:42.452 --> 16:48.015
Harold, don't. Harold, be careful
of your hair transplant!

16:48.191 --> 16:50.682
Anything is welcome.
I accept change.

16:50.860 --> 16:53.693
I don't have anything.
I gave it to that guy.

16:55.598 --> 16:57.964
You know, you could just say no.

16:58.134 --> 16:59.567
You don't have to humiliate me.

16:59.736 --> 17:03.103
I may be dressed as a clown,
but I am a person.

17:03.273 --> 17:05.798
- The guy took...
- I don't need people like you...

17:05.974 --> 17:07.532
...looking down their noses at me.

17:07.710 --> 17:11.703
I am just a street performer
trying to make enough to get by.

17:11.881 --> 17:14.348
Doctor, is there a doctor anywhere?

17:14.517 --> 17:16.040
We need a doctor!

17:16.219 --> 17:19.586
What are you, showing off
for your girlfriend here, is that it?

17:19.756 --> 17:23.782
I'm not his girlfriend. We dated
for a while but things didn't work out.

17:24.160 --> 17:27.060
You people make me sick.

17:30.500 --> 17:33.469
That is one angry clown.

17:33.636 --> 17:35.501
The hardest part
about being a clown...

17:35.672 --> 17:39.403
...it seems to me, would be that you're
constantly referred to as a clown.

17:39.576 --> 17:42.010
"Who is that clown?
I'm not working with that clown.

17:42.178 --> 17:43.611
Did you hire that clown?

17:43.780 --> 17:45.179
The guy's a clown."

17:45.381 --> 17:47.246
How do you even start into
being a clown?

17:47.417 --> 17:49.146
How do you know you
wanna be a clown?

17:49.319 --> 17:52.117
I guess you just get to a point
where your pants look so bad...

17:52.755 --> 17:54.723
...it's actually easier
to become a clown...

17:54.891 --> 17:57.018
...than having the proper alterations
done.

17:57.360 --> 18:01.194
If you think about it, a clown,
if there isn't a circus around them...

18:01.364 --> 18:03.798
...is really just a very annoying person.

18:03.967 --> 18:07.334
I mean, you're in the back seat
of this guy's Volkswagen...

18:07.503 --> 18:10.802
"What, you're picking somebody
else up? Oh, man."

18:11.240 --> 18:14.266
I got one. Who needs one?
Pagliacci. Pagliacci.

18:14.677 --> 18:16.941
The tragic clown. Pagliacci...

18:21.484 --> 18:23.247
What did you say?

18:24.253 --> 18:25.914
What, are you a cop?

18:26.923 --> 18:28.652
No. I'm a clown.

18:30.326 --> 18:32.294
Man, you look familiar.

18:33.496 --> 18:34.963
You ever been to the circus?

18:35.632 --> 18:37.998
- Well, when I was a kid.
- Did you like it?

18:38.167 --> 18:40.635
Well, it was fun.

18:41.304 --> 18:43.864
Was kind of scared of the clowns.

18:45.308 --> 18:47.674
Are you still scared of clowns?

18:48.978 --> 18:50.536
Yeah.

18:53.182 --> 18:54.547
We're gonna miss the overture.

18:54.717 --> 19:01.088
Overture, curtains, lights
This is it, we'll hit the heights

19:01.257 --> 19:07.423
And, oh, what heights we'll hit
On with the show, this is it

19:11.267 --> 19:13.861
You know, it is so sad.

19:14.037 --> 19:17.063
All your knowledge of high culture
comes from Bugs Bunny cartoons.

19:19.242 --> 19:22.336
Oh, there's that clown again.
What does he want from me?

19:22.645 --> 19:24.840
Look, I'm serious.
I don't have the quarter.

19:25.014 --> 19:27.574
- That guy took it.
- I don't want any money.

19:29.419 --> 19:31.512
I smell cherry.

19:33.956 --> 19:36.390
- It's Binaca.
- Binaca?

19:41.464 --> 19:42.692
Go! Go!

19:42.965 --> 19:46.366
- All right, what did we say, 275?
- Two fifty.

19:47.003 --> 19:50.370
- Two fifty? Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.

19:50.840 --> 19:53.206
- All right. All right, 250.
- George!

19:53.843 --> 19:55.811
- Susan.
- I don't believe it.

19:55.978 --> 19:58.037
I'm so glad I caught you.

19:58.381 --> 20:00.941
What are you doing here?
You were going to the airport.

20:01.117 --> 20:03.312
Some plane problems.
They landed in Philadelphia.

20:03.486 --> 20:06.319
So what? They don't have another
plane? She couldn't take a bus?

20:06.489 --> 20:08.889
She's coming in tomorrow.
But I made it.

20:09.058 --> 20:11.185
Yeah. How about that? You made it.

20:11.360 --> 20:14.659
I'm so excited. Now we get to see
the opera together.

20:14.831 --> 20:18.323
We get to go to the opera...
Get out of here... Together.

20:18.501 --> 20:20.992
- Who's that?
- That's, that's Harry Fong.

20:21.170 --> 20:23.764
He's a very good friend of mine.
He's a big opera buff.

20:23.940 --> 20:26.602
Enjoy the show there, Harry!

20:26.843 --> 20:29.744
- Come on. Let's go.
- You know what?

20:29.912 --> 20:32.403
- Come on. You gotta let us in.
- Not without tickets.

20:32.582 --> 20:34.447
We have tickets. Just not with us.

20:34.617 --> 20:37.518
Well, that's a problem. Excuse me.

20:38.121 --> 20:40.589
You don't understand.
Someone's after us, a crazy clown.

20:40.757 --> 20:43.692
- He's trying to kill us!
- A crazy clown is after you?

20:43.860 --> 20:46.260
Oh, that's rich.

20:46.429 --> 20:48.556
Clear the way so people
with tickets can pass.

20:48.731 --> 20:50.596
- We're with him.
- Are you guys ready?

20:50.767 --> 20:52.325
- Yes. Yes.
- Have you seen George?

20:52.502 --> 20:54.970
- We thought he was with you.
- Come on. He's on his own.

20:55.138 --> 20:56.605
Here.

20:57.940 --> 20:59.840
Here I come.

21:01.778 --> 21:04.246
- These are great seats, huh?
- Yeah.

21:05.081 --> 21:08.812
Boy, some cast, huh?
Pavarotti, Eva Marton.

21:08.985 --> 21:11.215
Eva Marton. I've heard of her.

21:11.387 --> 21:15.016
- Who's she playing?
- She's playing Pagliacci's wife, Nedda.

21:15.191 --> 21:17.625
- Nedda?
- Yeah.

21:17.827 --> 21:19.021
Oh, my God.

21:19.195 --> 21:22.596
Excuse me. Excuse me.

21:22.765 --> 21:24.062
Excuse me.

21:24.233 --> 21:26.064
Excuse me.

21:36.512 --> 21:38.537
Susan, what are you doing here?

21:38.714 --> 21:40.841
- My friend's flight couldn't make it.
- Hi.

21:41.017 --> 21:43.781
- Where's George?
- I got his ticket.

21:43.953 --> 21:46.683
He decided not to come.
He said he was uncomfortable.

21:46.856 --> 21:48.289
Uncomfortable?

21:48.457 --> 21:50.322
How do you think I feel?

21:51.561 --> 21:55.019
- How much did you pay for that ticket?
- One seventy-five.

21:57.600 --> 21:59.932
Kramer, who did you sell
your ticket to?

22:00.102 --> 22:03.094
Some nut in a clown suit.

22:10.213 --> 22:13.341
I had some friends drag me
to an opera recently.

22:13.516 --> 22:15.541
They've all got those little
opera glasses.

22:15.718 --> 22:19.586
Do you really need binoculars?
How big do these people have to get...

22:19.922 --> 22:21.150
...before you can spot them?

22:21.324 --> 22:26.557
These opera kids, they're going
250, 280, 325.

22:26.729 --> 22:28.754
They're wearing
big white woolly vests.

22:28.931 --> 22:32.697
The women have the breastplates,
the bullet hats, the horns coming out.

22:32.869 --> 22:35.099
You can't pick these people out,
forget opera.

22:35.271 --> 22:40.106
Think about optometry.
Maybe that's more your thing.
