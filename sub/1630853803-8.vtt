02:37.324 --> 02:40.577
So, what time was it
when you showed up at the scene?

02:41.078 --> 02:42.579
It was probably about 2:30.

02:43.830 --> 02:47.084
Was that your wife calling you
or the officers?

02:47.084 --> 02:49.586
What? I went over this
that night with the officers.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.129
I don't understand why--
-Hello?

02:55.384 --> 02:56.677
Ma'am.

02:56.677 --> 02:59.513
Inspector Sager. SFPD.

03:01.765 --> 03:03.225
Is everything all right?

03:03.225 --> 03:06.144
I'm here about my colleague, Thomas Baden.

03:06.228 --> 03:07.646
He was killed a few weeks ago.

03:08.355 --> 03:09.356
You mind sitting down?

03:19.658 --> 03:21.702
I just wanted
to ask you guys a few questions.

03:22.703 --> 03:24.705
Of course.
-It's come to our attention

03:24.705 --> 03:28.041
that there was a bit of
a physical altercation earlier that night

03:28.125 --> 03:30.669
between Officer Baden and your husband.

03:31.545 --> 03:34.423
Any chance you guys could
tell me more about that?

03:36.091 --> 03:37.968
It was personal...

03:40.304 --> 03:43.557
He was a friend of my wife's.
-We had a romantic relationship.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.226
Yeah.

03:46.810 --> 03:48.353
I'm aware.

03:49.605 --> 03:51.273
So, is that what the fight was about?

03:53.233 --> 03:54.234
Yes, sir.

03:55.277 --> 03:58.363
No other issues between the two of you?

03:58.447 --> 03:59.615
No, sir.

04:02.868 --> 04:03.869
Sophie, right?

04:04.870 --> 04:07.706
Do you mind if you
and I have a minute alone?

04:09.124 --> 04:10.292
Of course.

04:12.544 --> 04:13.879
I'm fine.

04:16.464 --> 04:18.175
I'll be out back if you need me.

04:30.229 --> 04:33.774
I knew Baden for a long time.
We were friends.

04:33.774 --> 04:37.444
And at one point
he seemed worried about your safety.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.905
I thought I owed it to him to follow up.

04:40.405 --> 04:44.493
So the last couple of months,
he came to me several times.

04:44.493 --> 04:47.871
He was asking me about
your incident on the ferry.

04:47.955 --> 04:50.999
He seemed to think
that there was more to the story.

04:53.752 --> 04:55.087
Is there?

04:56.213 --> 04:57.631
He wanted an investigation.

04:57.631 --> 05:00.384
Thought the least I could do
after all this, was give it to him.

05:02.386 --> 05:04.972
You did an investigation?

05:06.223 --> 05:08.475
In the days leading up to his death,

05:08.559 --> 05:11.854
he used police resources
to find the footage from the ferry.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.648
Have you seen the footage?

05:16.358 --> 05:17.401
Yes.

05:17.401 --> 05:20.362
It's clear from the footage
that you jumped off the boat

05:20.362 --> 05:23.782
about a quarter mile from shore,
near a place called Point San Pablo.

05:24.616 --> 05:27.411
Okay.
-There was someone else in the footage.

05:27.411 --> 05:28.745
A witness.

05:29.371 --> 05:31.248
I tracked him down.
-What?

05:31.248 --> 05:34.459
He remembered you.
Happy to answer a few questions for me.

05:35.252 --> 05:36.420
What did he say?

05:36.420 --> 05:38.755
That you were calm and focused.

05:39.464 --> 05:43.594
He said that it seemed like
you were waiting for the right time,

05:43.594 --> 05:45.220
some specific location.

05:45.304 --> 05:48.307
You ever ask yourself why
you were on that boat in the first place?

05:49.016 --> 05:50.225
Why you were going there?

05:51.351 --> 05:53.312
Why would it matter where I jumped?

05:57.232 --> 06:00.944
If I were you, I'd go right back to
the beginning, retrace your steps.

06:01.612 --> 06:04.531
Maybe Baden was right,
maybe there's more to the story.

06:06.909 --> 06:08.619
Sorry. I forgot my phone.

06:11.496 --> 06:12.497
Is everything okay?

06:13.540 --> 06:14.750
Yeah. Everything's fine.

06:18.003 --> 06:19.046
All right then.

06:21.548 --> 06:22.633
Take my card.

06:23.133 --> 06:24.426
And please,

06:25.427 --> 06:27.554
if there's anything else you need,
just call me.

06:30.265 --> 06:31.391
Good luck to you.

06:33.143 --> 06:34.269
Thank you, Officer.

06:59.628 --> 07:01.046
What did he say to you?

07:02.756 --> 07:05.384
He was just checking up on me.

07:05.884 --> 07:07.386
Wanted to make sure I was okay.

07:08.220 --> 07:09.221
Right.

07:10.556 --> 07:12.182
And are you okay?

07:15.769 --> 07:17.855
I'm just gonna go get cleaned up.

07:18.981 --> 07:21.024
Okay. You leave in the dark,

07:21.108 --> 07:22.985
you come home
looking like you've been crying.

07:22.985 --> 07:25.487
I'm sure you can understand
why that worries me, Soph.

07:25.571 --> 07:26.738
Yeah, I get it.

07:26.822 --> 07:28.448
Everyone's always worried about me.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.617
But to be honest with you, James,
after everything,

07:30.701 --> 07:34.079
you're not my biggest concern.
-I was trying to protect you.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.456
That doesn't change what happened.

07:41.920 --> 07:44.798
I wasn't the one that brought
this mess into our lives, you know.

08:05.068 --> 08:07.404
Well. Good morning to you too.

08:07.404 --> 08:09.489
You get any visits from the cops lately?

08:11.700 --> 08:12.701
Oh, really? No?

08:13.535 --> 08:16.455
'Cause I just had a lovely chat
with our local inspector

08:16.455 --> 08:18.457
about a shooting
that happened a few weeks ago.

08:18.457 --> 08:21.335
Turns out when a cop dies,
people ask a lot of questions.

08:22.211 --> 08:24.838
Oh, shit.
-Yeah. Real fun way to start my Tuesday.

08:24.922 --> 08:26.715
I thought maybe you'd had
the fucking pleasure too.

08:27.883 --> 08:29.801
What do they know?
-What do they know?

08:31.428 --> 08:33.554
That my wife was fucking the guy,

08:33.639 --> 08:36.308
and that I had a fight with him
five hours before he died.

08:36.390 --> 08:38.477
And you know what?
I get it. It's not a good look.

08:38.559 --> 08:41.563
Jesus. Will you fucking slow down--
-I told you not to get involved in this.

08:41.647 --> 08:42.688
And now look where we are.

08:44.816 --> 08:46.276
Okay.
-Fuck.

08:46.360 --> 08:47.319
We'll fix it.

08:48.111 --> 08:49.112
Just tell me what to do.

08:49.196 --> 08:51.573
I'll do anything I can to help.
-Just stop!

08:51.657 --> 08:54.868
Stop helping. Stop looking into us.
Stop doing everything,

08:54.952 --> 08:57.913
because everything you have done
has only made things worse.

10:23.707 --> 10:24.708
Hey.

10:25.751 --> 10:26.835
What's going on?

10:28.545 --> 10:30.672
I'm just getting rid of a few things.

10:31.840 --> 10:33.675
Thought I'd take them to charity.

10:34.259 --> 10:36.970
I mean,
how many pairs of shoes do I really need?

10:39.223 --> 10:42.267
But I thought you loved this stuff.

10:42.351 --> 10:43.519
I don't know.

10:43.519 --> 10:47.564
I mean,
maybe it meant something to me before.

10:48.482 --> 10:51.318
But now
it just all seems like extra stuff.

10:56.782 --> 10:57.783
Okay.

11:01.245 --> 11:04.498
I'm just thinking about what's important.

11:05.874 --> 11:07.626
Things in my life that really matter.

11:09.461 --> 11:10.462
Yeah.

11:11.338 --> 11:15.843
Look, I know
the last few weeks have been hard.

11:18.554 --> 11:20.472
But I don't want
to live like that anymore.

11:21.974 --> 11:22.975
No, me neither.

11:24.142 --> 11:27.896
Maybe... there's a way through this.

11:30.107 --> 11:31.441
Something on the other side?

11:34.194 --> 11:35.195
I think so.

11:46.540 --> 11:47.833
What's wrong?

11:47.833 --> 11:49.209
Nothing.

11:52.462 --> 11:55.090
I've just been waiting
to hear you say that for a long time.

12:08.896 --> 12:12.274
You're finally coming to terms
with what happened that day.

12:12.858 --> 12:14.359
That's progress.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.945
I now know my life wasn't perfect.

12:18.614 --> 12:21.575
I hurt people. And they hurt me.

12:23.076 --> 12:26.413
But I feel like I can see a path forward.

12:28.707 --> 12:30.626
Can I tell you something personal?

12:31.752 --> 12:32.753
About you?

12:33.670 --> 12:37.382
This case was uncharted territory for me.

12:38.592 --> 12:41.678
For a long time,
I wasn't sure we'd succeed.

12:42.721 --> 12:47.351
Normally, a therapist's work
is all about unpacking the past.

12:47.351 --> 12:49.228
We didn't have that.

12:49.228 --> 12:50.562
No, we didn't.

12:53.815 --> 12:57.986
It takes a lot of strength
to see how that can be a gift.

12:58.946 --> 13:03.200
How it can free you to write a new story.

13:10.332 --> 13:11.542
Our time's up.

13:20.717 --> 13:22.678
I'm sorry I haven't been by in a while.

13:23.720 --> 13:24.888
I've wanted to see you.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.850
It felt like now is the right time.

13:29.142 --> 13:30.519
I'm glad you came.

13:36.859 --> 13:37.860
Thank you, Hannah.

13:49.204 --> 13:51.331
You look so beautiful.

13:52.082 --> 13:53.083
Thank you.

13:54.543 --> 13:57.004
I may have a word with Caroline.

13:57.004 --> 13:58.088
Yeah?
-Yeah.

14:01.842 --> 14:03.927
Hey. How are you?

14:09.308 --> 14:11.143
I was hoping you'd be here.

14:12.769 --> 14:13.896
Sophie.

14:14.646 --> 14:17.858
I didn't know you were coming.
It's been too long.

14:17.858 --> 14:21.528
I just decided to get out of the house.
Last minute.

14:22.154 --> 14:23.155
How are you?

14:24.781 --> 14:25.866
I've been laying low.

14:25.866 --> 14:29.745
Working through some things.
But I wanted to see you.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.749
I miss you.
-Yeah, I miss you too.

14:35.501 --> 14:37.753
And I also just wanted to say...

14:39.796 --> 14:44.635
thank you, by the way,
for being there for me.

14:46.678 --> 14:50.224
I know being my friend
hasn't always been easy.

14:52.434 --> 14:53.685
But you've never wavered.

14:54.937 --> 14:57.523
And that means the world.

14:57.523 --> 15:00.192
Sophie, why are you saying this?

15:01.818 --> 15:03.237
I just want you to know.

15:04.863 --> 15:06.532
'Cause if not now, when?

15:08.617 --> 15:10.285
If it isn't my favorite couple.

15:11.245 --> 15:12.246
Elliot.

15:12.246 --> 15:14.373
Hi.
-I'm so happy you're here.

15:17.793 --> 15:18.836
What was that for?

15:22.756 --> 15:24.508
I'm just gonna go get a drink.

15:31.849 --> 15:33.350
What can I get you?

15:33.350 --> 15:34.434
Champagne?

15:37.813 --> 15:38.981
Sophie, you made it.

15:40.190 --> 15:41.191
Nice dress.

15:43.652 --> 15:44.903
You like it?

15:46.738 --> 15:47.865
Sure, why not?

15:51.118 --> 15:53.453
You know,
you don't have to pretend anymore.

15:54.329 --> 15:56.874
I know you just put up with me
because you care about him.

15:57.583 --> 15:59.459
Oh, come on. Don't sell yourself short.

16:00.043 --> 16:03.589
At the very least I find you entertaining.

16:05.340 --> 16:07.885
What's with
the sudden bout of honesty, anyway?

16:08.927 --> 16:10.846
I just thought I'd tell you
how I really feel.

16:13.056 --> 16:16.476
And, how do you really feel, Sophie?

16:21.398 --> 16:23.901
There are a lot of bad people
in this room.

16:24.401 --> 16:25.485
I used to be one of them.

16:26.111 --> 16:28.238
But you know what
the worst kind of person is?

16:29.281 --> 16:30.991
An asshole who thinks he's a good guy.

16:32.910 --> 16:35.954
Yeah. You see, that's the thing, Sophie.
We don't get to choose.

16:36.747 --> 16:38.123
That shit's in your DNA.

16:38.916 --> 16:39.917
I don't believe that.

16:40.834 --> 16:42.794
Maybe you should cut yourself some slack.

16:43.837 --> 16:46.798
Being a dick is a lot more fun
when you stop hating yourself for it.

16:47.382 --> 16:48.800
I'm gonna be right back.

16:48.884 --> 16:49.927
Okay.

16:50.552 --> 16:53.472
You know, one of these days
he's gonna see you for who you really are.

16:54.097 --> 16:55.098
Just like I do.

16:56.183 --> 16:57.351
They all are.

16:59.561 --> 17:00.812
Hey. Is everything okay?

17:01.355 --> 17:02.481
Of course.
-Yeah?

17:03.649 --> 17:04.858
Here you go, ma'am.

17:06.609 --> 17:08.319
Cheers.
-Cheers.

17:14.992 --> 17:15.993
Do you wanna dance?

17:16.744 --> 17:17.746
Really?

17:18.497 --> 17:19.498
Okay.

17:59.329 --> 18:00.664
Busy day?

18:01.915 --> 18:02.916
Yeah, a little.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.961
Just some year-end stuff, wrapping up.

18:05.961 --> 18:08.297
You know how crazy it gets before
the holidays.

18:14.219 --> 18:15.554
Party was good last night.

18:16.054 --> 18:17.306
Nice to see everyone.

18:18.182 --> 18:19.600
Yeah, it was.

18:20.976 --> 18:22.477
Okay. I gotta go.

18:25.314 --> 18:26.982
And can I borrow the car?

18:27.482 --> 18:29.067
Got a few errands I need to get done.

18:29.568 --> 18:30.777
Yeah, of course.

18:32.362 --> 18:33.655
What else you up to today?

18:36.617 --> 18:37.826
I think I'll go for a run.

18:41.163 --> 18:42.164
Love you.

21:13.273 --> 21:15.526
Yes, he's here. Can I put you on hold?

21:22.032 --> 21:23.450
James?
-Yeah?

21:24.993 --> 21:26.411
The police are on the phone for you.

21:32.751 --> 21:33.836
This is James Ellis.

21:36.380 --> 21:38.090
Yes, I'm her husband.

21:40.801 --> 21:42.386
I don't understand.

21:42.386 --> 21:44.304
You found her stuff? Where?

21:44.388 --> 21:46.265
Near the middle of the bridge.

21:46.265 --> 21:49.685
Sweatshirt, a watch, and a backpack.

21:51.103 --> 21:52.896
Wallet with ID was inside.

21:52.980 --> 21:55.232
Sophie Ellis? This hers?

21:56.233 --> 21:57.943
Yeah. It is hers.

22:00.237 --> 22:02.114
Can I ask you some questions?

22:02.114 --> 22:03.198
Yeah. Okay.

22:05.075 --> 22:07.077
Does your wife have a history
of mental illness?

22:11.415 --> 22:12.416
Yes.

22:12.416 --> 22:14.501
Has she ever tried to take
her own life before?

22:19.631 --> 22:20.632
Sir?

22:22.634 --> 22:23.635
Yes.

22:25.387 --> 22:27.681
Look, I know this is hard.

22:28.182 --> 22:31.018
But this incident,
it follows a very familiar pattern.

22:31.935 --> 22:33.937
Your wife has a history of...

22:48.702 --> 22:50.412
Tell me what happened today.

22:50.412 --> 22:51.997
Where did she say she was going?

22:54.499 --> 22:55.501
Sir?

22:57.878 --> 22:59.421
She asked to borrow my car.

24:06.446 --> 24:08.699
<i>I know this must be hard
for you to understand.</i>

24:09.449 --> 24:11.493
<i>That it feels like
it's all happening again.</i>

24:12.202 --> 24:14.788
<i>But just for one second,</i>

24:16.039 --> 24:19.376
<i>let yourself admit
that maybe I was right the first time.</i>

24:21.461 --> 24:23.589
<i>Maybe this is
what was supposed to happen.</i>

24:25.716 --> 24:29.261
<i>A man died, James. Because of us.</i>

24:30.721 --> 24:32.222
<i>Because of what you did.</i>

24:36.226 --> 24:37.895
<i>And we can't come back from that.</i>

25:13.305 --> 25:14.306
Sophie?

25:24.775 --> 25:26.193
Oh, my God, James.

25:35.994 --> 25:36.995
It doesn't feel real.

25:39.414 --> 25:40.666
I know.

25:40.666 --> 25:41.959
I mean, it doesn't make any sense.

25:41.959 --> 25:45.295
I keep waiting for her to come home.

25:48.131 --> 25:50.843
You know, all they found was her stuff.

25:51.802 --> 25:54.680
A watch and a backpack and a jacket.

25:56.306 --> 26:00.769
James.
I know that this is so hard to accept.

26:03.063 --> 26:07.776
And that there is nothing scarier
than the unknown.

26:08.694 --> 26:11.780
Even the truth.
-What is the truth here?

26:14.741 --> 26:16.159
She tried this before.

26:17.661 --> 26:21.874
She left her things on the bridge
because she wanted them to be found.

26:23.750 --> 26:27.129
She wanted us to know she was gone.

26:28.839 --> 26:32.301
No. She was doing better.

26:33.093 --> 26:34.094
Was she?

26:35.137 --> 26:37.055
'Cause the last time I saw her...

26:38.682 --> 26:40.559
It felt like she was saying goodbye.

26:56.992 --> 26:58.994
James, I'm so sorry.

27:00.621 --> 27:02.039
<i>How are you holding up?</i>

27:04.875 --> 27:07.002
She just left.

27:08.879 --> 27:11.965
On a regular day,
she said she was going for a run.

27:12.049 --> 27:13.675
And then she never came home again.

27:14.676 --> 27:16.428
<i>I know it's hard to understand.</i>

27:16.512 --> 27:18.222
No. She was doing better.

27:18.222 --> 27:20.599
<i>She was happy. It doesn't make any sense.</i>

27:21.099 --> 27:25.812
Sometimes people seem happiest
after they've made the choice.

27:26.688 --> 27:29.650
<i>If she'd already decided to end her life,</i>

27:29.650 --> 27:32.528
she could have felt... unburdened.

27:33.153 --> 27:35.531
What?
-People make amends.

27:37.574 --> 27:39.493
<i>Let go of material things.</i>

27:40.744 --> 27:42.871
<i>Tell people how they really feel.</i>

27:46.124 --> 27:51.046
<i>Maybe she felt better because
she was finally ready to go.</i>

27:56.426 --> 27:59.596
I'm sorry, James. I really am.

28:01.223 --> 28:02.349
Yeah, me too.

28:23.287 --> 28:24.288
Thank you.

28:42.556 --> 28:43.557
Jesus Christ.

28:44.808 --> 28:46.101
Hey.

28:47.227 --> 28:48.353
James. Buddy.

28:50.647 --> 28:51.857
What are you doing here?

28:52.357 --> 28:53.775
Just let me take you home.

28:54.860 --> 28:55.986
No.

28:57.654 --> 28:59.364
Well, then you need to get out of there.

29:00.407 --> 29:01.825
Come stay with us for a while, huh?

29:01.909 --> 29:04.077
I don't wanna
fucking talk to you right now.

29:04.161 --> 29:05.162
Don't you get that?

29:17.966 --> 29:18.967
James.

29:19.551 --> 29:20.552
Slow down.

29:21.595 --> 29:22.596
James.
-What?

29:23.722 --> 29:25.224
What do you want to say, Harrison?

29:26.808 --> 29:27.976
Go on. Fucking say it.

29:31.230 --> 29:32.523
She was always going to do this.

29:34.525 --> 29:35.859
Or something like it.

29:36.944 --> 29:39.404
Push the eject button. Blow it all up.

29:43.951 --> 29:46.286
You took my wife from me.

29:48.038 --> 29:49.665
What?
-That's why she did this.

29:49.665 --> 29:51.333
That's why she's dead.

29:51.333 --> 29:52.751
'Cause she thought it was me.

29:53.252 --> 29:55.003
She thought I was the monster.

29:56.338 --> 29:57.339
But it was you.

30:00.676 --> 30:01.760
Fuck you.

30:02.678 --> 30:05.472
We never would have been in that situation
if she hadn't put us there.

30:05.556 --> 30:07.391
You're the one who had him followed,
Harrison.

30:07.891 --> 30:09.852
Yeah, he tried to sink
the fucking company.

30:09.852 --> 30:11.687
So I had
the fucking company look into him.

30:11.687 --> 30:14.022
I couldn't know
what that investigator was going to find.

30:14.106 --> 30:15.607
Are you fucking serious?

30:16.108 --> 30:17.651
That's how you've rationalized this?

30:18.777 --> 30:21.530
You pulled the trigger, Harrison.

30:21.530 --> 30:24.491
You told those fucking criminals
he was a cop.

30:24.575 --> 30:27.578
I told you not to fucking out him,
and you did it anyway.

30:28.161 --> 30:32.207
He was a cop, Harrison,
and you killed him.

30:34.543 --> 30:36.628
If you thought I was so fucking wrong
to do what I did,

30:36.712 --> 30:38.964
then why didn't you just fucking tell her?
Huh?

30:38.964 --> 30:41.175
I was protecting you.

30:42.259 --> 30:45.262
She never could have turned
her own husband in. But you?

30:45.262 --> 30:49.224
You would have gone to jail.
So I took the fucking hit for you.

30:49.808 --> 30:51.560
I guess that was my biggest mistake.

30:56.273 --> 30:57.649
Well, now you've lost us both.

30:58.609 --> 31:00.986
Enjoy your fucking life, buddy. Have fun.

31:02.321 --> 31:03.322
Fuck you.

31:46.782 --> 31:48.200
Got your texts.

31:49.159 --> 31:52.704
I'm sorry. I didn't know who else to call.

31:55.707 --> 31:58.502
I would ask if you're okay...

32:01.964 --> 32:03.882
I don't know how to go on without her.

32:04.967 --> 32:08.887
For so long I've been in her orbit and...

32:11.557 --> 32:13.600
And without her, I'm just falling.

32:18.021 --> 32:20.607
Can you stay for a while, please?

32:22.317 --> 32:24.319
James, I can't keep doing this.

32:26.446 --> 32:27.614
You're right.

32:28.198 --> 32:29.491
You were in her orbit.

32:30.492 --> 32:32.035
And I am too.

32:33.495 --> 32:37.833
And I've been wrapped up with this
for so long...

32:40.294 --> 32:43.755
I don't even
know who I am anymore without you.

32:50.470 --> 32:52.264
Fuck. I'm sorry.

32:55.642 --> 32:58.645
Yeah, look. I'm sorry, okay. It's a lot.

33:01.231 --> 33:03.192
I know it's been a lot.

33:05.360 --> 33:07.029
I love you, you know that.

33:08.488 --> 33:12.618
But if I'm going to heal from this,

33:12.618 --> 33:17.456
from all of this...

33:23.045 --> 33:26.215
I need to move on too.

33:29.134 --> 33:30.135
What does that mean?

33:30.719 --> 33:33.096
Listen, you know you paid me back,

33:33.180 --> 33:34.765
and you made things right.

33:34.765 --> 33:39.728
And now it's time for you
to take care of yourself.

33:39.728 --> 33:41.021
Wait.

33:41.021 --> 33:43.982
"You made things right"?
What are you talking about?

33:44.066 --> 33:45.067
The loan.

33:45.067 --> 33:47.486
3.1 is fine.

33:48.153 --> 33:50.697
Let's just call it even, okay?

33:56.328 --> 33:58.497
Take care of yourself, James.
-No. Caroline.

34:00.499 --> 34:01.500
Caroline.

34:14.721 --> 34:15.722
Thank you.

34:20.768 --> 34:22.603
Okay, how can I help you?

34:23.522 --> 34:26.567
My wife has an account here.
-Okay.

34:26.567 --> 34:28.777
And she recently passed away.

34:29.570 --> 34:31.697
And I'm not sure what
the right process is,

34:31.697 --> 34:35.284
but I wanted to close the account
and retrieve the funds.

34:35.284 --> 34:37.870
I'm so sorry. What was your wife's name?

34:38.871 --> 34:39.913
Tess Caldwell.

34:41.415 --> 34:42.748
Do you have an account number?

34:43.333 --> 34:47.920
Yep. 001-36-489216.

34:52.217 --> 34:54.303
I'm sorry,
but that account doesn't exist here.

34:55.344 --> 34:57.054
No, she has an account here.

34:58.182 --> 35:00.809
I'm certain. I saw the balance.
It's 3.1 million.

35:00.893 --> 35:02.060
No, I'm sorry.

35:04.730 --> 35:05.814
Did she close the account?

35:07.274 --> 35:08.442
She took the money out?

35:09.610 --> 35:11.195
When? What was the date?

35:13.155 --> 35:15.407
Let me guess. A few weeks ago?
-I'm sorry,

35:15.407 --> 35:17.659
but there's no more information
I can give you at this time.

35:17.743 --> 35:18.744
Not without a lawyer.

37:23.702 --> 37:24.703
Oh, my God.

37:35.589 --> 37:40.385
<i>If you're watching this...
I'm guessing you couldn't let me go.</i>

37:43.305 --> 37:45.724
<i>Even if I gave you
every reason in the world to do it.</i>

37:48.268 --> 37:50.312
<i>We aren't good for each other, James.</i>

37:52.064 --> 37:53.315
<i>Look at what we've done.</i>

37:54.650 --> 37:58.153
<i>An innocent man died
because of what you did.</i>

38:00.447 --> 38:02.324
<i>I know you're probably angry with me.</i>

38:03.617 --> 38:05.869
<i>Furious for doing this.</i>

38:09.081 --> 38:15.003
<i>But don't you think,
in some weird way, you deserved it?</i>

38:21.260 --> 38:23.220
<i>This is what you did to me, isn't it?</i>

38:25.848 --> 38:26.849
<i>I woke up.</i>

38:28.141 --> 38:29.309
<i>And you told me a lie.</i>

38:32.187 --> 38:33.981
<i>I thought our life
was something it wasn't.</i>

38:36.859 --> 38:38.360
<i>I guess now you know how that feels.</i>

38:39.361 --> 38:40.362
What the fuck?

38:40.946 --> 38:44.157
<i>Honestly, it's easy to make people think
you've killed yourself...</i>

38:45.993 --> 38:47.995
<i>when everyone thinks you've already tried.</i>

39:27.117 --> 39:29.953
You jumped, dear. You jumped.

39:30.579 --> 39:34.166
<i>That shirt I just cut off her
costs more than we make in a week.</i>

39:52.184 --> 39:54.937
Hey. Let me take that.

40:43.235 --> 40:47.364
If I were you, I'd go right back to
the beginning, retrace your steps.

41:54.097 --> 41:56.767
<i>You know,
I've been so obsessed with the past.</i>

41:57.851 --> 42:01.438
<i>Putting the pieces back together,
knowing the whole story.</i>

42:02.689 --> 42:03.690
<i>This whole time,</i>

42:03.774 --> 42:06.568
<i>I've been asking everybody else
for answers they don't have.</i>

42:07.486 --> 42:10.113
<i>Explanations. A reason why.</i>

42:11.240 --> 42:13.492
<i>But the only one who ever knew my secrets...</i>

42:16.662 --> 42:17.663
<i>is me.</i>

42:53.448 --> 42:56.743
<i>You always said
it felt like I was trying to run away.</i>

42:57.452 --> 43:01.832
<i>Well...
I finally found out where I was going.</i>

43:03.876 --> 43:08.255
<i>Now, I need to find out why.</i>

43:13.552 --> 43:15.137
<i>I guess I don't know what else to say.</i>

43:17.222 --> 43:18.223
<i>Except...</i>

43:20.434 --> 43:21.435
<i>goodbye.</i>

43:25.355 --> 43:26.982
<i>I'll see you on the other side.</i>

43:44.124 --> 43:46.376
<i>Welcome to Heathrow international airport</i>.

43:50.088 --> 43:53.175
<i>All UK passengers please use
the fast track</i>.

43:53.675 --> 43:54.968
Next, please.

44:02.809 --> 44:03.810
Name?

44:04.394 --> 44:05.395
Tess Caldwell.

44:11.026 --> 44:12.319
This expires in two weeks.

44:13.737 --> 44:14.780
You know that?

44:15.948 --> 44:16.949
Just in time.

44:22.496 --> 44:23.497
Welcome home.

44:24.748 --> 44:25.749
Thank you.

44:31.630 --> 44:33.715
<i>You've reached Sophie Ellis.
Leave a message.</i>

44:35.843 --> 44:38.512
<i>Hi. It's me, your husband.</i>

44:39.555 --> 44:44.518
<i>You were probably smart enough to
destroy your phone and cover your tracks,</i>

44:44.518 --> 44:47.437
<i>but just in case you ever get this...</i>

44:49.481 --> 44:53.527
You're wrong about me, Sophie.
I'm not the person you think I am.

44:55.320 --> 44:57.573
<i>But did you really think
this was gonna work?</i>

44:58.156 --> 45:01.034
<i>Did you really think
this was going to drive me away?</i>

45:01.660 --> 45:03.120
<i>See, that's where you're wrong.</i>

45:05.789 --> 45:09.126
<i>I love you with every part of me.</i>

45:09.626 --> 45:12.254
<i>And that's never, ever gonna change.</i>

45:14.298 --> 45:16.133
<i>Look, I don't know where you are.</i>

45:17.342 --> 45:18.844
<i>But I do know this.</i>

45:20.220 --> 45:21.388
<i>Your past?</i>

45:21.889 --> 45:23.765
<i>It's a dangerous place to be.</i>

45:25.017 --> 45:26.685
<i>So be careful, okay?</i>

45:28.312 --> 45:29.730
<i>You take care of yourself.</i>

45:31.064 --> 45:32.065
<i>Until I get there.</i>

45:37.738 --> 45:40.866
I was thinking we need to do a little
weekend down at the country house soon.

45:40.866 --> 45:42.951
I think it's been too long.

45:45.329 --> 45:49.249
Eliza, that girl by the door
has been staring at you all night.

45:49.333 --> 45:50.334
What girl?

45:50.334 --> 45:51.418
There.

45:55.130 --> 45:57.090
Do you know her?
-No. Don't think so.

46:11.063 --> 46:12.064
Tess!

46:13.690 --> 46:14.691
Tess.

46:15.901 --> 46:16.902
I know it's you.

46:20.239 --> 46:21.406
What are you doing here?
