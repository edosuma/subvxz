00:56.923 --> 00:59.517
<i>If you asked me now who I am,</i>

01:00.927 --> 01:02.792
<i>the only answer I could give</i>
<i>with any certainty</i>

01:02.862 --> 01:06.007
<i>would be my name,
Charles Ryder.</i>

01:07.333 --> 01:11.770
<i>For the rest,
my loves, my hates,</i>

01:11.838 --> 01:14.568
<i>down even to my deepest desires,</i>

01:14.640 --> 01:17.905
<i>I can no longer say whether</i>
<i>these emotions are my own</i>

01:19.445 --> 01:23.006
<i>or stolen from those</i>
<i>I once so desperately wished to be.</i>

01:25.685 --> 01:29.746
<i>On second thoughts,</i>
<i>one emotion remains my own,</i>

01:31.123 --> 01:34.286
<i>alone among the borrowed</i>
<i>and the second-hand,</i>

01:35.795 --> 01:39.253
<i>as pure as that faith</i>
<i>from which I am still in flight.</i>

01:42.101 --> 01:43.329
<i>Guilt.</i>

02:07.827 --> 02:10.795
Been away, sir? Anywhere interesting?

02:10.863 --> 02:13.889
- Jungle.
- Jungle.

02:15.501 --> 02:16.661
Explorer, are we?

02:16.736 --> 02:19.569
- Painter.
- Painter?

02:19.639 --> 02:22.767
So, bye-bye beardy, hello smooth.

02:35.254 --> 02:38.280
Famous for his impressive
architectural portraits,

02:38.357 --> 02:42.691
British artist Charles Ryder
has taken New York by storm

02:42.795 --> 02:45.662
with a series of gripping jungle studies.

02:45.731 --> 02:47.358
To own a Ryder is currently the dream

02:47.433 --> 02:49.230
of every self-respecting
East Coast millionaire.

02:50.403 --> 02:53.167
You must be so proud of him.

02:53.239 --> 02:55.764
- Was he away long?
- Two years,

02:55.841 --> 02:59.800
- and it doesn't feel like a day.
- You must feel positively bridal.

03:01.247 --> 03:02.509
I can't paint
to save my life.

03:02.582 --> 03:03.606
Thank you.

03:03.683 --> 03:06.049
I can't even hold a buggering brush!

03:06.118 --> 03:12.387
But I know what I like. Lots of color.
Nice and bright.

03:12.458 --> 03:15.621
I see the jungle in your work
as a metaphor.

03:15.728 --> 03:20.756
Not least, the metaphysical semblance
of the chaos at the heart of civilization.

03:20.833 --> 03:22.664
Make an effort, Charles.

03:22.735 --> 03:26.728
You're not in South America now.
You're amongst civilized people.

04:07.213 --> 04:09.113
- Mr. Ryder, I wonder if I could...
- I'm so sorry. Excuse me.

04:09.181 --> 04:11.411
- Excuse me. Thank you very much.
...just have a conversation...

05:27.860 --> 05:29.418
Hello, Charles.

06:23.783 --> 06:26.809
- You're wearing a coat!
- Yes, Father, I am.

06:26.886 --> 06:28.786
Why?

06:28.854 --> 06:32.346
- I'm going up to Oxford.
- Ah. Yes.

06:35.461 --> 06:39.056
- Remind me. What are you taking?
- History.

06:39.131 --> 06:42.225
- And what allowance have I given you?
- A hundred pounds.

06:42.301 --> 06:46.294
How very indulgent of me.
Mind you, it all comes out of capital.

06:48.107 --> 06:51.634
Oh, I suppose this is the time
I should give you advice.

06:54.213 --> 06:56.841
Your mother was always
so good at that.

06:59.018 --> 07:00.883
Who's meeting you?

07:00.953 --> 07:02.784
Cousin Jasper offered
to show me around.

07:02.855 --> 07:04.413
Cousin Jasper!

07:06.325 --> 07:08.259
Most entertaining.

07:49.335 --> 07:50.700
Out of the way,
you silly fool.

07:50.769 --> 07:52.828
There you are, Charles.

07:53.672 --> 07:55.333
This way, please.

07:57.910 --> 08:02.108
Come along. As an only child,
you will, of course, have much to learn.

08:02.181 --> 08:05.844
Though I am only your cousin, Charles,
you must look upon me as a brother.

08:05.918 --> 08:08.785
Older, wiser,
but a brother nevertheless.

08:08.854 --> 08:12.881
Now, it is no secret that our families
are not rich in material wealth.

08:12.958 --> 08:14.289
Keep off the grass.

08:14.360 --> 08:20.026
But I like to think that we Ryders are,
all of us, rich in the striving of minds.

08:20.099 --> 08:21.657
Now, then... Not that way.

08:21.734 --> 08:25.295
Clothes. Dress as you do
in a country house.

08:25.371 --> 08:28.966
Never wear a tweed coat
and a flannel trousers, always a suit.

08:29.041 --> 08:31.509
And go to a London tailor.
You'll get a better cut.

08:31.577 --> 08:35.206
Protocol. First and foremost,
behaving with restraint...

08:35.280 --> 08:41.082
Nine adulteries, 12 liaisons,
64 fornications,

08:41.153 --> 08:43.587
and something approaching a rape

08:43.655 --> 08:49.060
rest nightly upon the soul
of our delicate friend Florialis,

08:49.128 --> 08:51.961
and yet the man is so
quiet and reserved in demeanor

08:52.031 --> 08:55.899
that he passes
for both bloodless and sexless.

08:59.138 --> 09:02.801
Sodomites, all of them. Steer well clear.

09:05.711 --> 09:08.339
Treat all dons
as you would the local vicar.

09:08.414 --> 09:10.473
With indifference.

09:10.549 --> 09:15.213
Oh, dear, oh, dear. This won't do at all.
You must change your rooms.

09:15.287 --> 09:17.187
I've seen many a man ruined

09:17.256 --> 09:20.419
through having ground floor rooms
in the front quad.

09:20.526 --> 09:22.050
People start dropping in.

09:22.127 --> 09:25.255
They leave their gowns here
and come and collect them before hall.

09:25.331 --> 09:28.198
You start giving them sherry
and before you know it they're...

09:33.539 --> 09:36.975
Sebastian, come along.
Look at the state of him.

09:37.042 --> 09:39.033
Come on, you're nearly clean.

09:46.452 --> 09:49.080
Oh, no, no, no, sir, stop.

09:49.154 --> 09:52.646
You don't clear up after yourself.
That's my job.

09:52.725 --> 09:55.694
Sorry, Lunt. What's all this?

09:55.761 --> 10:01.063
From the gentleman last night, sir.
He just called. Left a note for you.

10:07.706 --> 10:09.037
"I am very contrite.

10:09.108 --> 10:12.600
"Please come to luncheon today.
Sebastian Flyte."

10:12.678 --> 10:15.647
The Lord Sebastian Flyte,
don't you know?

10:15.748 --> 10:19.206
I'm sure it's quite a pleasure
to clear up after him.

10:19.852 --> 10:22.719
I take it
you'll be out to lunch today, then, sir.

10:22.788 --> 10:25.882
Yes, Lunt. I think I shall be.

11:08.400 --> 11:10.868
I've just counted them.

11:10.936 --> 11:14.497
There's five each and two over,
so I'm having the two.

11:16.408 --> 11:18.706
I'm unaccountably hungry today.

11:19.378 --> 11:21.869
I put myself unreservedly
in the hands of Dolbear and Goodall

11:21.947 --> 11:23.676
and feel so drugged
I've begun to believe

11:23.782 --> 11:26.615
the whole of yesterday evening
was a dream.

11:27.786 --> 11:29.686
Please don't wake me.

11:30.722 --> 11:33.247
- Do try one.
- Thank you.

11:34.660 --> 11:38.118
- What are they?
- Plover's eggs. The first this year.

11:39.598 --> 11:43.932
Mummy sends them from Brideshead.
They always lay early for her.

11:44.002 --> 11:46.698
You would, too, if you knew my mother.

11:49.341 --> 11:52.003
Are you terribly angry with me
about last night?

11:52.077 --> 11:56.309
No, not at all.
Thank you for the flowers.

11:58.550 --> 12:02.350
Aloysius, you can't go there.
Do sit down.

12:09.962 --> 12:12.055
- Tell me about you.
- Me?

12:13.499 --> 12:16.559
I'm in my first year, reading history,

12:18.670 --> 12:22.037
but really what I most want to be
is a painter.

12:22.107 --> 12:24.234
Would you like to paint me?

12:26.311 --> 12:29.769
Well, yes. Yes, if you like.

12:29.848 --> 12:31.839
It's so clever of you,
knowing what you want.

12:31.917 --> 12:34.215
I've no idea what I want.

12:34.286 --> 12:36.049
Except to be happy.

12:37.055 --> 12:38.545
If I can.

12:38.624 --> 12:40.683
Let's have some champagne.

12:41.727 --> 12:44.423
A glass each before the rowdies arrive.

12:49.101 --> 12:51.626
<i>You don't want to join the Old Boys.</i>

12:51.703 --> 12:55.571
They're all bloody drugged bogs
or collegers.

12:55.641 --> 12:57.302
Top me up,
will you, old man?

12:57.376 --> 13:00.539
- I don't remember you from Eton.
- I didn't go to Eton.

13:00.612 --> 13:04.946
Oh, really. Where then?
Harrow or Winchester?

13:06.084 --> 13:08.882
Rugby? Oh, not Charterhouse, I hope?

13:10.722 --> 13:12.713
You wouldn't have heard of it.

13:12.791 --> 13:14.691
There are other schools,
you know, Boy.

13:14.760 --> 13:17.228
Yes, I suppose there must be.

13:20.332 --> 13:22.061
- My dears.
- Hello, Blanche.

13:22.134 --> 13:23.328
Hello, Blanche.

13:23.402 --> 13:24.960
I couldn't get away before.

13:25.037 --> 13:28.632
I was lunching
with my preposterous tutor.

13:28.707 --> 13:32.643
I told him I had to change for footer.

13:39.651 --> 13:43.348
Anthony, you remember Charles.
From last night?

13:43.422 --> 13:45.982
Charles is reading history,
but he wants to be an artist.

13:46.058 --> 13:48.686
- No!
- Why ever not?

13:48.760 --> 13:52.127
- Either you are an artist or you are not.
- Hear, hear.

13:55.400 --> 13:57.960
- Then I am.
- Interesting.

13:59.104 --> 14:02.369
You have about you
a distinct hint of the pragmatic.

14:02.441 --> 14:06.138
What do you want to be an artist for?
I mean, what's the point of it?

14:06.211 --> 14:08.304
Why don't you just
buy a bloody camera

14:08.380 --> 14:11.178
and take a bloody photograph
and stop giving yourself airs?

14:11.250 --> 14:13.912
- That's what I want to know!
- That's it, go it, Boy!

14:13.986 --> 14:17.387
- I don't give myself airs.
- Yes, you do.

14:17.456 --> 14:20.391
And, anyway,
you haven't answered my question.

14:20.459 --> 14:22.188
Come on! Answer!

14:23.161 --> 14:26.562
- Answer, answer, answer, answer...
- Yes.

14:26.632 --> 14:28.964
Answer, answer, answer, answer...

14:29.034 --> 14:34.529
Because a camera
is a mechanical device

14:34.606 --> 14:37.404
which records a moment in time,

14:37.509 --> 14:42.537
but not what that moment means
or the emotions that it evokes.

14:43.715 --> 14:48.948
Whereas a painting,
however imperfect it may be,

14:50.289 --> 14:52.883
is an expression of feeling.

14:54.793 --> 14:56.693
An expression of love.

14:58.230 --> 15:00.425
Not just a copy of something.

15:04.303 --> 15:08.262
And who on earth do you think
cares about your feelings?

15:08.373 --> 15:09.772
I do.

15:09.841 --> 15:12.401
Boy, you're an oaf. Behave yourself.

15:13.011 --> 15:15.479
To art and love.

15:18.216 --> 15:20.309
To art and love!

15:25.057 --> 15:29.790
We'd just arrived in his rooms, then,
without even a, "By your leave,"

15:29.895 --> 15:33.729
the Lord Flyte pokes his head
through the window and vomits.

15:34.433 --> 15:37.732
Ground floor rooms, you see.
Poor Charles may never recover.

15:37.803 --> 15:39.862
- Morning, Jasper.
- Morning.

15:49.614 --> 15:51.013
Two tries out of you today...

15:51.083 --> 15:54.246
Charles. You're to come away at once!

15:54.319 --> 15:57.220
I've got a basket of strawberries
and a bottle of Chateau Peyraguey,

15:57.289 --> 15:59.814
which isn't a wine you've ever tasted,
so don't pretend.

15:59.891 --> 16:02.121
It's heaven with strawberries.

16:22.080 --> 16:24.776
Just the place to bury a crock of gold.

16:29.287 --> 16:30.584
I should like to bury
something precious

16:30.655 --> 16:33.283
in every place where I've been happy.

16:34.826 --> 16:37.989
And, then,
when I was old and ugly and miserable,

16:40.399 --> 16:45.735
I could come back
and dig it up and remember.

16:58.683 --> 17:02.210
Come along, Charles.
There's someone I want you to meet.

17:31.450 --> 17:34.749
- Is this where you live?
- It's where my family live.

17:38.023 --> 17:39.285
Don't worry,
you won't have to meet them.

17:39.357 --> 17:43.316
- Oh, but I should like to.
- You can't. They're away.

18:07.252 --> 18:10.221
Everything's shut up.
We better go this way.

18:23.902 --> 18:25.199
Keep up.

18:35.914 --> 18:38.644
Charles. Charles.

18:49.961 --> 18:55.058
Well, this is a surprise!
How lovely to see you.

18:56.868 --> 18:59.063
Meet my new chum, Charles.

18:59.838 --> 19:03.365
Charles, this is Nanny Hawkins.
This is who I wanted you to meet.

19:03.441 --> 19:06.808
- I don't think I know you, do I?
- How do you do?

19:06.878 --> 19:11.008
Your friend has charming manners.
What family are you from, Charles?

19:11.082 --> 19:14.711
- No family. I mean, no one important.
- Charles is an artist.

19:15.887 --> 19:19.220
- He's going to paint me.
- How jolly.

19:20.692 --> 19:22.683
You've come at just the right time.

19:22.761 --> 19:24.854
Lady Marchmain's
on her way up from London.

19:24.930 --> 19:27.125
It's the Conservative Women's Tea.

19:27.232 --> 19:28.824
They always turn out for Brideshead.

19:28.900 --> 19:31.528
I'm afraid we may have
to miss them, Nanny.

19:31.603 --> 19:33.332
Your mother will be disappointed.

19:33.405 --> 19:35.134
I'm sure Her Ladyship
would want to meet...

19:35.206 --> 19:39.142
Can't be done, I'm afraid.
Got to get back or we'll be gated.

19:47.485 --> 19:50.181
I pray for my dear Sebastian every day.

19:52.691 --> 19:55.717
- Charles!
- It was very nice to meet you.

20:02.467 --> 20:04.833
- Come along, Charles.
- Couldn't we just have a quick look?

20:04.903 --> 20:06.632
We've seen who we came for.
We can go.

20:06.705 --> 20:08.468
Just a little look.

20:46.311 --> 20:47.903
Don't be such a tourist, Charles.

20:47.979 --> 20:49.003
If you're that keen,

20:49.080 --> 20:52.777
you can see it all for a shilling
on Queen Alexandra's Day.

20:54.185 --> 20:56.346
God, I loathe that painting!

20:59.791 --> 21:03.283
I could show you the chapel, I suppose,
if we're quick.

21:27.285 --> 21:29.276
What did you do that for?

21:30.655 --> 21:33.317
- You're not Catholic, are you?
- No.

21:34.759 --> 21:38.559
- I was just trying to fit in.
- Well, don't.

21:44.869 --> 21:46.336
Come on, come on!

21:46.404 --> 21:47.428
Sorry, I'm afraid I don't have the knack.

21:47.505 --> 21:49.632
Charles, what are you doing?

21:55.046 --> 21:56.308
Car. Now.

22:30.048 --> 22:31.982
Who was that in the car
with your mother?

22:32.050 --> 22:33.984
- My sister.
- What's she like?

22:34.052 --> 22:35.076
For goodness sake, Charles,

22:35.153 --> 22:37.917
I don't keep asking you questions
about your family.

22:37.989 --> 22:40.048
But I've never
asked you anything before.

22:40.125 --> 22:41.956
You're so inquisitive.

22:42.026 --> 22:44.392
Well, you're so mysterious about them.

22:44.462 --> 22:47.295
I hoped I was mysterious
about everything.

22:48.366 --> 22:50.357
Why don't you want me
to meet your family?

22:50.435 --> 22:51.766
Who are you ashamed of, them or me?

22:51.836 --> 22:53.997
Don't be so vulgar, Charles.

22:58.943 --> 23:03.312
I'm not having you mixed up
with my family. You're my friend.

23:05.183 --> 23:07.151
I don't have a family.

23:09.654 --> 23:11.087
You have me.

23:16.194 --> 23:19.721
Sebastian and Charles,
<i>contra mundum.</i>

23:23.735 --> 23:25.327
<i>Contra mundum.</i>

23:44.856 --> 23:46.118
Father?

23:48.927 --> 23:50.155
Father?

23:53.198 --> 23:56.463
- Back already?
- Term's over.

23:56.534 --> 23:57.933
So soon?

24:17.522 --> 24:18.511
Thank you.

24:19.490 --> 24:21.856
- Father, I have to leave at once!
- Oh, yes?

24:21.926 --> 24:23.325
A great friend of mine
has had a terrible accident.

24:23.394 --> 24:25.521
- I must go to him.
- May I?

24:29.701 --> 24:33.797
"Gravely injured.
Come at once. Sebastian."

24:35.907 --> 24:38.808
I'm sorry you're upset.

24:38.877 --> 24:40.435
Reading this message,

24:40.511 --> 24:45.380
I would say that the accident was not
as serious as you seem to suggest

24:45.450 --> 24:49.386
or it would not have been signed
by the victim himself.

24:51.456 --> 24:56.826
Still, of course, he may well be
fully conscious, but horribly paralyzed.

24:56.928 --> 25:00.261
Remind me.
Why is your presence necessary?

25:00.331 --> 25:03.129
I told you, he's a great friend.

25:03.201 --> 25:08.002
Well, I shall miss you, my boy,
but don't hurry back on my account.

25:26.624 --> 25:28.421
Take your bag, sir?

25:34.732 --> 25:36.131
Excuse me!

25:41.906 --> 25:43.806
Are you Charles Ryder?

25:45.343 --> 25:47.743
Yes. Sorry. Hello.

25:47.812 --> 25:51.270
I'm Julia, Sebastian's sister.
I've been sent to pick you up.

25:51.349 --> 25:53.044
Hop in, Mr. Ryder.

25:57.121 --> 26:00.113
- Case in the back.
- Sorry, yes.

26:29.620 --> 26:30.848
How's Sebastian?

26:30.922 --> 26:33.447
- He's fine.
- Fine?

26:33.524 --> 26:35.321
Did he tell you he was dying?

26:35.393 --> 26:37.691
Well, I thought... His message said...

26:37.762 --> 26:40.230
I expect he thought
you wouldn't come if you knew.

26:40.331 --> 26:41.821
He's not badly hurt, then?

26:41.899 --> 26:45.801
He cracked a bone in his foot
so small it hasn't even got a name.

26:45.870 --> 26:48.430
- How did it happen?
- Playing croquet.

26:52.910 --> 26:55.378
I must admit,
I did think it was a little queer,

26:55.446 --> 26:57.812
you traveling all this way
for a croquet injury.

26:57.882 --> 27:00.544
I don't mind.
It's wonderful to be here again.

27:00.618 --> 27:02.609
Is it? Why?

27:02.687 --> 27:06.088
Well, it's such a beautiful house,
for one thing.

27:06.157 --> 27:08.148
I can't stand the place.

27:13.531 --> 27:15.761
Be an angel and light me one.

27:54.205 --> 27:56.196
There you are, at last!

27:57.308 --> 28:01.301
- I thought you were dying.
- I thought I was, too.

28:01.379 --> 28:03.404
The pain was excruciating.

28:04.916 --> 28:07.908
Julia, ask Wilcox
to fetch us some champagne.

28:07.985 --> 28:10.476
- I hate champagne.
- For our guest.

28:12.423 --> 28:15.119
Well, take your coat off. You'll boil.

28:20.832 --> 28:22.595
Come along, Charles.

28:37.415 --> 28:39.246
I thought you hated champagne.

28:39.317 --> 28:40.409
I do.

28:41.686 --> 28:44.712
I suppose Sebastian's told you
all about us?

28:44.822 --> 28:46.722
No. No, nothing at all,
as a matter of fact.

28:46.791 --> 28:48.452
And nor should I.

28:49.861 --> 28:51.453
What?

28:51.529 --> 28:54.726
- I take it you're not one of us?
- Don't answer.

28:54.799 --> 28:56.460
I don't live like this,
if that's what you mean.

28:56.534 --> 28:59.503
She means you're not a Catholic.

28:59.570 --> 29:01.800
Sorry, no. No, nothing at all.

29:01.873 --> 29:05.434
- You mean you're an atheist?
- Well, yes, I suppose.

29:05.510 --> 29:07.137
Strictly speaking, we're C of E,

29:07.211 --> 29:11.477
but Father only ever goes
for Christmas and funerals.

29:12.450 --> 29:14.384
He likes those.

29:14.452 --> 29:17.387
- What about your mother?
- She's dead.

29:19.090 --> 29:20.717
I was very young.

29:20.791 --> 29:23.259
She died working for the Red Cross.

29:23.327 --> 29:24.885
Which, given her devotion to good,

29:24.962 --> 29:28.056
does rather point up
the arbitrariness of it all.

29:28.132 --> 29:31.693
I see. So, you're here arbitrarily?

29:31.769 --> 29:34.294
He's here as my friend.

29:35.840 --> 29:38.536
Given Mr. Ryder's
staunch position on religion,

29:38.609 --> 29:41.077
don't you think he ought to know
what he's getting into?

29:41.145 --> 29:42.942
Leave Charles out of it.

29:43.014 --> 29:45.209
- Tell me.
- Oh, God.

29:45.283 --> 29:48.309
Mummy takes her faith
very seriously, indeed.

29:48.386 --> 29:51.913
So seriously, in fact,
that our fat little priest, Father Mackay,

29:51.989 --> 29:54.014
called her a living saint.

29:54.725 --> 29:57.023
Mind you, he drinks.

29:57.094 --> 29:59.528
Sebastian and I
are a couple of heathens.

29:59.597 --> 30:03.658
I'm not a heathen, I'm a sinner.
Cast out from God's love.

30:03.734 --> 30:07.067
As for you,
you're not a heathen at all, not really.

30:08.206 --> 30:11.141
Why do we always end up
talking about family?

30:12.476 --> 30:14.341
It's time for my bath.

30:16.380 --> 30:19.406
Good evening, Mr. Ryder.
Look after my brother.

30:29.694 --> 30:31.594
I don't think your sister
likes me very much.

30:31.662 --> 30:34.358
I don't think
she cares for anyone much.

30:35.499 --> 30:36.864
I love her.

30:38.102 --> 30:39.660
She's like me.

30:40.838 --> 30:43.500
Drink in remembrance of me.

30:48.246 --> 30:49.235
Hang on.

31:19.010 --> 31:22.377
In fact, I know that that's checkmate.

31:28.252 --> 31:29.617
Come here.

31:32.923 --> 31:35.517
<i>If only it could be</i>
<i>like this always.</i>

31:36.861 --> 31:38.351
Always summer.

31:39.830 --> 31:41.320
<i>Always alone.</i>

31:42.533 --> 31:44.194
Fruit always ripe.

31:54.478 --> 31:55.672
Cheers.

32:01.852 --> 32:03.046
Now,

32:05.523 --> 32:07.115
try this.

32:16.334 --> 32:19.701
- No?
- It's a shy little wine. Like a gazelle.

32:24.308 --> 32:27.402
- Like a leprechaun.
- Dappled in a tapestry meadow.

32:29.280 --> 32:31.305
A flute by still water.

32:32.650 --> 32:37.417
This is a wise old wine.

32:43.794 --> 32:46.160
A prophet in a cave.

32:46.230 --> 32:47.629
And this

32:49.633 --> 32:52.295
is a string of pearls on a white neck.

32:57.842 --> 33:01.141
- A swan.
- The last unicorn.

33:54.031 --> 33:55.521
Who's that?

34:03.107 --> 34:06.008
- Is that your brother?
- Yes, that's Bridey.

34:06.977 --> 34:10.139
- He seems all right to me.
- Wait till you meet him.

34:16.020 --> 34:17.248
Mother.

34:30.434 --> 34:31.731
Hello, there.

34:31.802 --> 34:33.735
Go away,
we're not decent!

34:33.804 --> 34:36.568
- Mummy's here.
- We know.

34:36.639 --> 34:39.040
She's invited Charles to dinner.

34:47.818 --> 34:50.081
It's not what we
agreed upon, Sebastian,

34:50.154 --> 34:53.021
when we talked about this
at Christmas, when you came down.

34:53.090 --> 34:55.991
It's no use crying, darling.
That's just childish.

34:57.828 --> 35:00.854
That's not going to help, is it?

35:00.931 --> 35:03.525
You see, darling,
whatever yesterday's sins,

35:03.601 --> 35:06.331
we must all pray for God's forgiveness.

35:07.905 --> 35:13.070
So now, you try and try again now.

35:13.143 --> 35:16.544
Be a good boy.
For God and for Mummy.

35:21.418 --> 35:24.615
Now, just put your shirt on now.

35:24.688 --> 35:26.588
Dining room's this way.

35:30.494 --> 35:34.089
Is Sebastian all right?
He seemed upset.

35:34.498 --> 35:35.487
Oh.

35:36.233 --> 35:38.793
He and Mummy often have these talks.

35:40.337 --> 35:43.534
Flannels for dinner?
Very bold, Mr. Ryder.

35:43.607 --> 35:46.804
- Will your mother mind?
- Yes, she'll be appalled.

35:47.912 --> 35:51.370
No, don't worry.
She'll be understanding.

35:51.448 --> 35:54.611
- Do you often do that?
- What?

35:54.685 --> 35:59.088
- Say one thing, mean another?
- Yes and no.

36:18.709 --> 36:20.142
Thank you.

36:29.453 --> 36:31.045
- Amen.
- Amen.

36:34.258 --> 36:38.126
Welcome to Brideshead, Mr. Ryder.
I've been hearing all about you.

36:38.195 --> 36:42.427
I do hope you didn't let Sebastian
call you away in too much of a rush.

36:42.499 --> 36:45.127
I'm afraid I didn't quite have time
to pack the right things.

36:45.202 --> 36:49.138
Sebastian must lend you some clothes
while you're here.

36:49.206 --> 36:51.367
Or perhaps Bridey's a better fit.

36:51.442 --> 36:53.740
Are you a Bridey
or a Sebastian, Mr. Ryder?

36:53.811 --> 36:57.941
He can't borrow Bridey's clothes.
Bridey dresses like a bank clerk.

36:58.015 --> 37:01.746
Don't be vulgar, Cordelia.
Vulgar is not the same as funny.

37:03.787 --> 37:06.813
I hope you've been
looked after properly, Ryder.

37:06.890 --> 37:09.484
Has Sebastian
been seeing to the wine?

37:10.394 --> 37:13.557
Yes. Sebastian's been
seeing to the wine.

37:13.631 --> 37:15.496
Delighted to hear it.

37:17.001 --> 37:20.095
- You're fond of wine?
- Yes, very.

37:20.170 --> 37:23.230
I wish I were.
It's such a bond with other men.

37:24.608 --> 37:28.237
At Christ Church, I tried to get drunk
more than once, but I didn't enjoy it.

37:28.312 --> 37:30.337
What do you enjoy, Bridey?

37:32.316 --> 37:35.376
Hunting, shooting,

37:37.788 --> 37:39.085
fishing.

37:41.992 --> 37:45.393
And what form do your pleasures take,
Mr. Ryder?

37:45.462 --> 37:47.726
- Sorry, pleasures?
- Your hobbies.

37:47.831 --> 37:49.822
- What do you do to relax?
- He drinks.

37:49.900 --> 37:52.960
Drinking is not a hobby, Sebastian.

37:53.037 --> 37:55.835
- You live in London, is that correct?
- Yes.

37:55.906 --> 37:58.340
- Whereabouts?
- Paddington.

38:00.210 --> 38:02.303
You live in a railway station?

38:02.379 --> 38:07.612
No, no. Sorry. No, I live nearby.

38:07.685 --> 38:08.947
I see.

38:09.019 --> 38:12.011
And has this led
to an interest in trains?

38:14.291 --> 38:15.781
No.

38:15.859 --> 38:19.920
So, are you close
with Sebastian's crowd?

38:22.332 --> 38:23.697
Not really.

38:23.767 --> 38:28.500
- With Anthony Blanche?
- We're acquainted.

38:29.473 --> 38:31.703
Charles is a painter, Mummy.

38:33.610 --> 38:35.373
How charming.

38:35.446 --> 38:36.970
We must get you
to paint something for us.

38:37.047 --> 38:40.312
- Would you do that, Mr. Ryder?
- I'd be delighted.

38:40.384 --> 38:44.184
I think Brideshead's the most
beautiful house I've ever seen.

38:47.324 --> 38:50.225
- It's utterly magical.
- How kind you are.

38:52.963 --> 38:54.760
Summer at Brideshead.

38:55.532 --> 38:58.660
Mr. Ryder must stay with us
for the rest of the vacation.

38:58.736 --> 39:01.796
As a matter of fact,
I've just heard from Papa.

39:02.873 --> 39:05.637
He wants me to go and see him
in Venice. And Julia.

39:05.709 --> 39:07.301
I see.

39:07.377 --> 39:09.572
And do you intend
to accept this invitation?

39:09.646 --> 39:11.011
Yes. Why not?

39:11.081 --> 39:12.548
What about you, Julia?
Will you be going?

39:12.616 --> 39:13.913
I'd like to.

39:13.984 --> 39:16.612
Wouldn't you rather
stay at Brideshead?

39:22.559 --> 39:25.585
Well, yes, if you want me to.

39:28.432 --> 39:32.562
- You must not neglect your duty.
- No, Mother.

39:39.643 --> 39:43.602
I think we might spend a little time
in the chapel after dinner.

39:45.015 --> 39:49.349
- Would you join us, Mr. Ryder?
- Thank you.

39:49.419 --> 39:51.910
You do know Charles is an atheist?

39:53.590 --> 39:55.455
An agnostic, surely.

39:57.494 --> 39:59.018
Actually, no.

40:00.330 --> 40:04.596
But you'll join us, anyway,
out of curiosity.

40:06.870 --> 40:08.235
Thank you.

40:13.210 --> 40:15.974
- No Sebastian?
- No, Mummy.

40:17.714 --> 40:20.205
Charles, are you really an atheist?

40:21.618 --> 40:25.520
- Yes, I am.
- How awful for you.

40:25.589 --> 40:27.682
I'll put you on my prayer list.

40:27.758 --> 40:32.161
I have a long list of people I pray for,
including six black Cordelias in Africa.

40:32.229 --> 40:34.390
It's a new thing. You send five bob
to some nuns in Africa,

40:34.464 --> 40:37.433
and they christen a baby after you.

40:37.501 --> 40:38.490
Right.

40:39.336 --> 40:43.272
Thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

40:43.340 --> 40:46.241
Give us this day our daily bread,

40:46.310 --> 40:48.369
and forgive us our trespasses

40:48.445 --> 40:51.846
as we forgive
those who trespass against us.

40:51.949 --> 40:57.182
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

40:57.254 --> 40:58.380
Amen.

41:40.097 --> 41:42.657
Have you ever
been to Venice, Mr. Ryder?

41:42.733 --> 41:44.724
No. No, I haven't.

41:44.801 --> 41:48.328
Every ambitious young man
should visit Venice.

41:48.405 --> 41:50.999
It makes one sound more complete.

41:53.110 --> 41:58.070
I was thinking, if Sebastian were to go,

41:58.148 --> 42:01.606
it might be a good thing
if you were to accompany him.

42:02.853 --> 42:05.481
He needs someone plausible
by his side.

42:06.556 --> 42:12.119
I gather last time he was there, he was
befriending some very odd types.

42:12.195 --> 42:14.925
It's youthful high spirits, I understand,

42:15.799 --> 42:20.634
but in the end,
we must all accept God's limits.

42:22.472 --> 42:24.235
Atheist, or no.

42:29.846 --> 42:31.871
I know I can rely on you.

42:32.883 --> 42:35.613
You seem to me
a very reliable young man.

43:12.422 --> 43:15.858
- San Giovanni e Paolo.
- Oh, dear.

43:15.926 --> 43:19.054
I can see
you're going to be impossibly curious.

43:19.162 --> 43:23.258
By the way, I should warn you.
Our lovely father is rather a scoundrel.

43:23.333 --> 43:26.029
He lives
in one of the palazzos with Cara.

43:26.103 --> 43:28.162
- Who's Cara?
- His mistress.

43:29.406 --> 43:32.136
Poor Papa's rather shunned by society.

43:32.209 --> 43:34.700
Not the Italians, of course.
They adore him.

43:39.182 --> 43:43.118
- Santa Maria dei Miracoli.
- I know. I've seen the postcard.

44:11.248 --> 44:13.944
- My dear boy!
- Darling, Papa.

44:15.986 --> 44:17.954
- You look so young!
- Do you think so?

44:18.021 --> 44:21.081
I've taken to playing tennis
at the Lido with a professional.

44:21.158 --> 44:23.285
Cara thinks I'm getting far too fat.

44:23.360 --> 44:24.588
Julia, come here.

44:24.661 --> 44:27.391
- Father.
- My child.

44:27.464 --> 44:29.728
- I wasn't sure if you'd come.
- Mummy gave me her blessing.

44:29.800 --> 44:32.360
Blessed by your mother.
What a saint that woman is.

44:32.436 --> 44:35.064
You know, I used to try everything
to please her.

44:35.138 --> 44:36.901
Julia, this is your friend, Mr. Ryder?

44:36.973 --> 44:39.771
- Charles is my friend, Papa.
- I see.

44:39.843 --> 44:42.539
- Delighted.
- How do you do, sir?

44:42.612 --> 44:46.412
- Welcome to Venice.
- Here's Cara. Now we can eat.

44:46.483 --> 44:48.451
Come along now. This way.

45:02.132 --> 45:04.999
Don't look so greedy. It won't go away.

45:06.136 --> 45:07.364
Sorry.

45:12.309 --> 45:14.834
I wasn't sure you'd come to Venice.

45:16.113 --> 45:17.944
Your father seemed
pleased to see you.

45:18.014 --> 45:20.812
I'm not sure Father
cares much if I come.

45:20.884 --> 45:23.876
He'd probably be just as happy
if it was only Sebastian.

45:23.954 --> 45:27.754
They adore each other.
They're alike in so many ways.

45:29.759 --> 45:31.624
- Who are you like?
- Me?

45:32.229 --> 45:33.218
Oh.

45:34.197 --> 45:35.459
Nobody.

45:36.399 --> 45:38.299
I'm the family shadow.

45:44.374 --> 45:45.636
Drinks.

45:49.079 --> 45:51.912
- Julia.
- Cara.

45:54.251 --> 45:58.051
Mr. Ryder, Sebastian tells me
you are a painter.

45:58.121 --> 46:00.681
- Charles is an artist.
- Good.

46:00.757 --> 46:05.023
Well, then I will show you all the
great art of Canaletto and Veronese.

46:05.996 --> 46:08.760
He never goes anywhere.
Such a philistine.

46:08.832 --> 46:12.529
I don't mind the art.
It's religion I can't stand.

46:12.602 --> 46:15.662
The Italians seem unable
to paint anything half decent

46:15.739 --> 46:18.537
without putting Christ dying in it.

46:18.608 --> 46:20.337
Of course, your mother loved Italy.

46:20.443 --> 46:23.276
- A pietà on every street corner.
- Don't be cruel.

46:23.346 --> 46:27.180
On the contrary, she'd be flattered.
God was always her first love.

46:27.250 --> 46:29.650
- Mummy loves all of us equally.
- Come now, Julia.

46:29.719 --> 46:32.187
You were the one who walked away!

46:38.295 --> 46:41.560
What must you think of us, Mr. Ryder?

46:41.631 --> 46:44.794
- A family of monsters, are we not?
- No, not at all.

46:46.336 --> 46:48.770
I lost my mother when I was young.

46:54.044 --> 46:59.573
Tell me, Mr. Ryder, as an artist,
what did you make of Brideshead?

47:00.750 --> 47:02.513
I thought it was magnificent.

47:02.586 --> 47:05.851
You think that? Really?

47:05.922 --> 47:08.254
And now, here you are in Venice.

47:09.159 --> 47:11.218
What a lot of temptations.

47:27.911 --> 47:32.314
He walks for two hours
every day. He wants to be immortal.

47:32.382 --> 47:35.840
But he's quite fragile, you know, inside.

47:37.954 --> 47:40.354
That woman nearly suffocated him.

47:41.958 --> 47:47.396
- She's been very kind to me.
- Oh, yes. I'm sure. But you will see.

47:48.732 --> 47:50.632
Well, just look at her children.

47:50.700 --> 47:53.362
Even when they were tiny,
in the nursery,

47:53.436 --> 47:55.233
they must do
what she want them to do,

47:55.305 --> 47:57.296
be what she want them to be.

47:57.374 --> 47:59.638
Only then, would she love them.

48:01.244 --> 48:06.648
It's not Lady Marchmain's fault.
Her God has done that to her.

48:06.716 --> 48:09.344
But surely you're Catholic, too?

48:09.419 --> 48:12.320
Yes, but a different sort.

48:12.389 --> 48:16.883
It's different in Italy. Not so much guilt.

48:16.960 --> 48:21.624
We do what the heart tell us,
and then we go to confession.

48:30.106 --> 48:32.802
Sebastian loves you very much, I think.

48:34.711 --> 48:35.700
There you are.

48:35.779 --> 48:40.273
They're very good,
these romantic English friendships,

48:40.350 --> 48:43.114
if they don't go on too long.

48:45.422 --> 48:49.415
For you, it's just a,
how do you say, "a phase"?

48:51.594 --> 48:54.859
But I think it's more than that
for poor Sebastian.

49:00.904 --> 49:03.031
Tread carefully, Mr. Ryder.

49:07.277 --> 49:08.539
Come on.

49:09.979 --> 49:12.573
- Hello.
- No! No!

49:18.521 --> 49:19.783
Come on.

49:21.224 --> 49:22.486
Got you.

50:15.378 --> 50:18.142
- Can't sleep.
- Try pajamas.

50:24.921 --> 50:28.357
I enjoyed the beach today.
I hope I wasn't too rough.

50:28.458 --> 50:30.255
You were very sweet.

50:36.132 --> 50:37.429
Charles?

50:39.669 --> 50:41.330
There you are.

50:50.780 --> 50:52.042
Sorry.

50:54.384 --> 50:55.908
Lots to drink.

50:59.923 --> 51:02.255
I'm so glad you're here.

51:02.325 --> 51:05.192
- I'm glad you're here.
- I'm glad I came.

51:05.261 --> 51:09.095
- Did I say I'm glad you're here?
- You're really glad I'm here?

51:21.878 --> 51:24.608
Let's get plastered.
- If you want.

51:24.714 --> 51:28.377
Oh, yes, I do. I want. I want.

51:36.926 --> 51:39.053
There's a wonderful chapel
near here!

51:39.128 --> 51:42.222
You will see a masterpiece, I tell you.

52:01.784 --> 52:04.150
The devil's got his eye on you!

52:07.490 --> 52:09.856
Well, then you must protect me.

52:32.515 --> 52:33.675
Julia!

53:22.498 --> 53:23.863
Julia.

53:23.933 --> 53:27.027
I got lost. All those people.

53:59.736 --> 54:01.533
What are you doing?

54:03.840 --> 54:05.501
What's the matter?

54:08.344 --> 54:09.333
No!

55:24.987 --> 55:27.251
Funny old religion, isn't it?

55:31.194 --> 55:32.593
Sebastian,

55:35.965 --> 55:39.628
what happened just now...
I never meant you to...

55:43.406 --> 55:45.897
If I'd known it was going to happen,

55:48.511 --> 55:50.172
I'd never have...

55:53.249 --> 55:55.843
I don't know what I'm supposed to...

56:55.778 --> 56:58.144
Checkmate.

57:01.384 --> 57:06.253
I'm boring you.
Perhaps it is dull for you here.

57:07.657 --> 57:09.784
You've been enjoying yourself?

57:09.859 --> 57:13.158
- I've been in Venice.
- Oh, yes, yes, I suppose so.

57:14.931 --> 57:19.391
The friend you were
so much concerned about, did he die?

57:22.605 --> 57:25.301
- No.
- I'm very thankful.

57:25.374 --> 57:29.367
You should have written to tell me.
I worried about him so much.

57:44.961 --> 57:47.191
Watch out, Flyte!
- Sebastian!

57:50.199 --> 57:52.633
- Sebastian!
- Leave me alone!

57:56.405 --> 57:59.704
- Damn. Where is he? The bastard.
- Who?

57:59.809 --> 58:01.970
- Mr. Samgrass.
- Who's Mr. Samgrass?

58:02.044 --> 58:05.207
One of Mummy's gang.
Fat little Catholic from All Souls.

58:05.281 --> 58:06.908
Bastard's been set up to follow me.

58:06.983 --> 58:09.247
I wouldn't mind
if he wasn't so infernally ugly.

58:09.318 --> 58:12.776
God, I feel a hundred years old.

58:12.855 --> 58:15.449
Why haven't you called round?
I've been worried.

58:15.524 --> 58:18.960
I was beginning to think
they hadn't sent you up.

58:19.028 --> 58:21.496
- Since Venice.
- Yes.

58:26.302 --> 58:28.532
- Damn! There he is again.
- Who? What are you talking about?

58:28.604 --> 58:31.038
- Mr. Samgrass! There!
- Do you mind?

58:31.107 --> 58:33.439
Mummy's hired him to watch me.

58:33.509 --> 58:35.875
- What does he want?
- My head on a plate.

58:35.945 --> 58:40.143
Look, if he's bothering you,
I can stop him.

58:42.551 --> 58:46.214
Dear Charles, always so certain.

58:47.390 --> 58:50.848
- I'm not certain of anything.
- Aren't you?

58:55.765 --> 58:58.791
By the way, Mummy's here.

59:00.503 --> 59:02.471
She has to talk to you.

59:04.106 --> 59:06.370
Probably wants you
to spy on me as well.

59:06.442 --> 59:08.205
Don't be like that.

59:09.779 --> 59:13.180
Why don't I come round
to your rooms later?

59:13.249 --> 59:15.979
I'm not sure I want to see you anymore.

59:29.665 --> 59:31.132
I'm so sorry.

59:50.319 --> 59:52.184
So, Charles,

59:55.124 --> 59:57.649
- how was Venice?
- Venice was fine.

59:59.095 --> 01:00:02.895
- A strange way to put it.
- It was beautiful.

01:00:02.965 --> 01:00:05.297
Speaking as an artist or a man?

01:00:07.803 --> 01:00:10.772
I want a word with you
about Sebastian.

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:12.808
I'm concerned about him.

01:00:14.610 --> 01:00:16.077
- Tea?
- No, thank you.

01:00:17.113 --> 01:00:19.013
- Why? Should I be?
- He's drinking too much.

01:00:19.081 --> 01:00:22.983
You must have noticed.
After all, I sent you to look after him.

01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:25.817
Yes, I suppose
we both drink too much, really.

01:00:25.888 --> 01:00:27.617
No, not at all. You drink to get drunk,

01:00:27.690 --> 01:00:31.251
Sebastian drinks to escape
the claims of his conscience.

01:00:35.031 --> 01:00:37.761
I do wish I could understand
why he's so particularly upset.

01:00:37.833 --> 01:00:41.530
Ever since he came back from Venice,
he's been unreachable.

01:00:42.338 --> 01:00:45.865
- Did something happen there?
- No.

01:00:48.377 --> 01:00:51.312
- You all had a good time?
- Yes.

01:00:52.548 --> 01:00:54.948
I wonder what it could have been.

01:00:57.787 --> 01:01:00.517
I hope you didn't let Julia mislead you.

01:01:01.690 --> 01:01:04.488
- I don't understand.
- I think you do.

01:01:06.028 --> 01:01:07.052
Please understand,

01:01:07.129 --> 01:01:10.997
I would not want you
to make yourself look foolish, Charles.

01:01:11.867 --> 01:01:16.736
Her future is not a question of choice.
It is a matter of faith.

01:01:18.307 --> 01:01:21.765
Were it simply
a difference in upbringing,

01:01:21.844 --> 01:01:23.573
this I might overlook.

01:01:23.646 --> 01:01:25.978
But you are a self-proclaimed atheist,

01:01:26.048 --> 01:01:29.814
and my daughter
is destined to marry a Catholic.

01:01:29.885 --> 01:01:32.012
God commands and we obey.

01:01:34.523 --> 01:01:35.751
However, we're forgetting ourselves.

01:01:35.825 --> 01:01:38.487
We're here to talk
about your friendship with my son.

01:01:38.561 --> 01:01:41.655
I'm not sure Sebastian
wants to be my friend anymore.

01:01:41.730 --> 01:01:43.357
Because of Julia?

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:46.925
But that is all cleared up now.

01:01:47.002 --> 01:01:48.731
We're giving a ball for Julia's 21 st.

01:01:48.804 --> 01:01:51.432
I'd like you
to keep Sebastian company.

01:01:52.541 --> 01:01:54.600
You came to Brideshead
as my son's friend.

01:01:54.677 --> 01:01:57.942
If you have
unaccountably offended him,

01:01:58.013 --> 01:02:01.847
it is surely not too much to ask
that you revisit your responsibilities.

01:02:03.619 --> 01:02:07.146
- To him or to you?
- To the family.

01:02:10.159 --> 01:02:12.059
And, of course,

01:02:12.128 --> 01:02:16.155
Brideshead does look particularly
beautiful at this time of year.

01:02:18.467 --> 01:02:20.526
Tell me, I'm curious.

01:02:22.204 --> 01:02:25.037
Since, as you claim,
you have no religion,

01:02:26.709 --> 01:02:29.803
what do you imagine
you are doing on this earth?

01:02:31.780 --> 01:02:34.180
Living my life, the same as you.

01:02:34.250 --> 01:02:37.777
But without faith,
what could your purpose possibly be?

01:02:41.590 --> 01:02:44.218
I want to look back and say that I was

01:02:44.927 --> 01:02:45.916
alive.

01:02:47.897 --> 01:02:51.594
That I didn't turn my back. That I tried.

01:02:53.802 --> 01:02:55.565
That I was happy.

01:02:55.671 --> 01:02:58.572
Happiness in this life is irrelevant.

01:02:58.641 --> 01:03:00.802
All that matters,

01:03:00.876 --> 01:03:06.075
the only thing of consequence,
is the life hereafter.

01:03:17.159 --> 01:03:19.184
Ready for the off.

01:03:20.329 --> 01:03:22.957
A beautiful day for it, isn't it? Come on.

01:03:51.193 --> 01:03:55.596
Funny, isn't it?
It's my little present to the family.

01:03:55.664 --> 01:03:58.827
- Rex Mottram. How do you do?
- Charles Ryder.

01:03:59.568 --> 01:04:02.628
Good to meet you, Charles.
Heard all about you.

01:04:03.272 --> 01:04:06.469
We should compare notes some time.

01:04:06.542 --> 01:04:08.737
- Going on the hunt?
- I don't think so.

01:04:08.811 --> 01:04:12.269
Wise man. Load of English
blue bloods on horseback.

01:04:13.182 --> 01:04:15.116
Got to fit in, though!

01:04:28.330 --> 01:04:29.729
Who is it?

01:04:34.103 --> 01:04:35.434
It's me.

01:04:36.438 --> 01:04:39.236
You could have knocked.
I nearly spilt my drink.

01:04:39.308 --> 01:04:40.502
I did.

01:04:43.946 --> 01:04:45.277
Sit down.

01:05:16.312 --> 01:05:18.906
If only it could be like this always.

01:05:19.715 --> 01:05:22.377
- Always summer.
- Ancient history.

01:05:24.019 --> 01:05:25.748
Pass me a towel.

01:05:41.737 --> 01:05:44.069
Where's that damn shirt?

01:05:45.974 --> 01:05:49.137
You're shaking. What is it?
What's the matter?

01:05:51.113 --> 01:05:53.081
Don't you know, Charles?

01:05:54.383 --> 01:05:57.113
"Why this is hell, nor am I out of it."

01:05:57.686 --> 01:06:00.814
- Sebastian, if I've ever done anything...
- It's not you.

01:06:01.990 --> 01:06:03.355
It's me.

01:06:07.996 --> 01:06:12.899
For God's sake, do stop mooning at me
like a great big cow!

01:06:14.903 --> 01:06:16.234
I'm fine.

01:06:18.173 --> 01:06:21.267
I'm fine so long
as I've got plenty of this.

01:06:21.343 --> 01:06:24.676
I want you to know that
whatever happened in Venice,

01:06:25.180 --> 01:06:28.809
I'm not in your mother's gang,
if that's what you think.

01:06:30.519 --> 01:06:32.316
I'm on your side.

01:06:33.789 --> 01:06:34.778
<i>Contra mundum.</i>

01:06:39.328 --> 01:06:41.057
Dear Charles,

01:06:45.334 --> 01:06:47.700
you're not in anybody's gang.

01:06:48.837 --> 01:06:51.328
That's always been your problem.

01:07:01.183 --> 01:07:05.017
Why are you going on the hunt?
I thought you detested hunting.

01:07:05.888 --> 01:07:07.082
I do.

01:07:09.291 --> 01:07:12.556
I'm going to leave Bridey
at the first covert,

01:07:12.628 --> 01:07:16.462
hack over to the nearest pub,
and spend the whole day drinking.

01:07:19.034 --> 01:07:20.331
If they treat me like a dipsomaniac,

01:07:20.402 --> 01:07:23.132
they can bloody well
have a dipsomaniac.

01:07:23.505 --> 01:07:25.200
Well, they can't stop you.

01:07:25.274 --> 01:07:27.504
They can, as a matter of fact,

01:07:30.679 --> 01:07:34.638
by not giving me any money.
They've stopped my bank account.

01:07:36.952 --> 01:07:39.716
I've pawned my watch
and cigarette case.

01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:43.249
That lasted for a bit,

01:07:45.060 --> 01:07:47.085
but that's all gone now.

01:07:48.564 --> 01:07:50.725
So, regretfully...

01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:53.864
Sebastian, I can't do that.

01:07:54.970 --> 01:07:58.030
- I thought you were on my side.
- I am.

01:07:58.106 --> 01:07:59.573
Well, then.

01:08:00.209 --> 01:08:02.575
Look, why don't I come with you?

01:08:03.412 --> 01:08:05.744
It's miserable drinking alone.

01:08:06.315 --> 01:08:08.180
We could get drunk together,
like we used to.

01:08:08.250 --> 01:08:09.239
No.

01:08:11.119 --> 01:08:12.916
I'm past all that.

01:08:14.156 --> 01:08:16.124
Thanks for the offer.

01:08:19.627 --> 01:08:20.787
Well?

01:08:22.397 --> 01:08:24.661
Are you with me or against me?

01:08:51.693 --> 01:08:54.526
Little bit further up
on the shoulder, though.

01:08:54.595 --> 01:08:56.063
Sarah, look.

01:08:57.165 --> 01:08:58.859
Sort of up here.

01:09:52.921 --> 01:09:57.187
Ladies and gentlemen,
it gives me great pleasure to announce,

01:09:57.259 --> 01:10:00.194
on top of the birthday festivities,

01:10:00.262 --> 01:10:04.392
the engagement of my eldest daughter,
the Lady Julia Flyte

01:10:04.466 --> 01:10:06.263
to Mr. Rex Mottram.

01:10:20.082 --> 01:10:22.414
Yes, it's marvelous, isn't it.

01:10:28.590 --> 01:10:32.026
- Thank you, Charles. I'd love to dance.
- Cordelia.

01:10:32.094 --> 01:10:34.688
- Cordelia, I'm...
- Come along!

01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:46.498
- Charles?
- Hmm?

01:10:47.309 --> 01:10:51.370
I hope you don't mind me asking,
but modern art,

01:10:52.014 --> 01:10:55.506
- it is all bosh, isn't it?
- Yes, it's all bosh.

01:10:55.584 --> 01:10:57.518
Good. I thought so.

01:11:00.856 --> 01:11:02.949
Get a grip, Charles!

01:11:04.192 --> 01:11:07.161
Rex! Rex, I need a better dancer.

01:11:08.163 --> 01:11:10.791
Yours for five minutes and no more.

01:11:10.866 --> 01:11:12.891
- Come along.
- Okay.

01:11:15.170 --> 01:11:17.502
You're rather tall, aren't you?

01:11:17.572 --> 01:11:19.301
Is that a handicap?

01:11:39.661 --> 01:11:41.652
Why didn't you tell me?

01:11:43.398 --> 01:11:46.060
It's not Sebastian. I don't believe that.

01:11:46.134 --> 01:11:48.125
Charles, I can't do this.

01:11:48.537 --> 01:11:51.005
- When we kissed...
- Please, stop!

01:11:52.908 --> 01:11:55.240
Why? It was wonderful.

01:11:56.978 --> 01:11:58.275
I know.

01:12:02.317 --> 01:12:04.615
I think about it all the time.

01:12:07.122 --> 01:12:08.919
I have no choice.

01:12:25.841 --> 01:12:28.810
- Oh, Sebastian.
- Never mind.

01:12:33.782 --> 01:12:35.716
- Oh, Charles.
- Don't!

01:12:40.455 --> 01:12:42.423
- Come along, old boy.
- I don't want your help.

01:12:42.491 --> 01:12:44.618
You're in tweed, Sebastian.
This is a ball.

01:12:44.693 --> 01:12:47.628
Bugger off, Bridey.
You're worse than wet.

01:12:51.166 --> 01:12:54.067
You see... What it is...

01:12:54.136 --> 01:12:56.434
I hate you all so very much!

01:12:57.205 --> 01:12:59.332
- Sebastian.
- Get off me!

01:12:59.808 --> 01:13:00.832
You don't care about me!

01:13:00.909 --> 01:13:02.706
All you ever wanted
was to sleep with my sister!

01:13:02.778 --> 01:13:05.076
Okay, Sebastian, that's enough.

01:13:06.047 --> 01:13:07.878
All right. I'm going.

01:13:50.559 --> 01:13:51.958
Charles,

01:13:54.930 --> 01:13:57.421
did you give Sebastian money today?

01:13:59.668 --> 01:14:01.135
Yes, I did.

01:14:03.371 --> 01:14:06.067
Knowing how he was likely to spend it?

01:14:07.943 --> 01:14:09.137
Yes.

01:14:10.812 --> 01:14:12.575
I don't understand.

01:14:13.281 --> 01:14:16.216
How could you be so nice
in so many ways,

01:14:17.452 --> 01:14:20.216
and then do something
so wantonly cruel?

01:14:21.089 --> 01:14:25.116
We all liked you so much.
I don't understand how we deserved it.

01:14:27.729 --> 01:14:32.598
Do you think it's better
to make him feel like a criminal?

01:14:34.336 --> 01:14:36.736
Having him watched
every second of the day?

01:14:36.805 --> 01:14:39.672
But you deliberately
helped him to drink.

01:14:42.277 --> 01:14:44.643
You're the reason he drinks,

01:14:46.114 --> 01:14:47.411
not me.

01:14:48.717 --> 01:14:50.344
All I did was

01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:53.683
try to give him a little freedom.

01:14:53.755 --> 01:14:57.919
No, you just wanted him to like you.
You're so desperate to be liked.

01:14:57.993 --> 01:15:00.621
I think you should leave now, Charles.

01:16:23.778 --> 01:16:26.713
Hello, there.
Would you like me to hold the ladder?

01:16:26.781 --> 01:16:28.271
Yes, thanks.

01:16:32.921 --> 01:16:35.719
I'm Celia Mulcaster, by the way.

01:16:38.293 --> 01:16:39.851
Charles Ryder.

01:16:41.096 --> 01:16:45.590
I saw your paintings in the brochure
and thought how charming they looked.

01:16:48.536 --> 01:16:50.595
No need to look so gloomy.

01:16:51.339 --> 01:16:54.331
If I had half your talent, I'd be delirious.

01:16:56.511 --> 01:16:58.843
You can thank me, if you want.

01:17:00.849 --> 01:17:02.214
Thank you.

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:07.782
Would you like me
to buy something now?

01:17:26.408 --> 01:17:29.741
Silent and grave,
and then "pop," mouse is dead.

01:17:31.479 --> 01:17:33.709
- Charles.
- Lady Marchmain.

01:17:35.917 --> 01:17:37.578
Thank you, Father.

01:17:39.654 --> 01:17:42.748
I'm so glad your son
didn't die of his injuries.

01:17:55.770 --> 01:17:58.500
Please, sit down.

01:17:59.074 --> 01:18:00.871
I'm fine, thank you.

01:18:03.478 --> 01:18:05.070
How did you know where I lived?

01:18:05.146 --> 01:18:07.046
My driver found you.

01:18:07.115 --> 01:18:09.777
The Ryders of Paddington
are limited in number.

01:18:09.851 --> 01:18:12.718
I hear you have your first exhibition
at the Royal Academy.

01:18:12.787 --> 01:18:14.414
Congratulations.

01:18:14.889 --> 01:18:17.050
I'm sure you're not here
to ask me how I am.

01:18:17.125 --> 01:18:21.494
No. The last time we saw each other,
it's true I spoke rather harshly.

01:18:22.230 --> 01:18:25.427
I'm not here to apologize.
What I said, I meant.

01:18:26.234 --> 01:18:29.431
I took you into my confidence,
and you betrayed me.

01:18:30.238 --> 01:18:33.002
I do hope you're not asking me
to agree with you.

01:18:33.074 --> 01:18:35.736
- I act only as God directs.
- Rubbish.

01:18:36.277 --> 01:18:39.542
God's your best invention.
Whatever you want, he does.

01:18:39.614 --> 01:18:44.210
- I am not here to argue with you.
- Good. I'm glad to hear it.

01:18:44.285 --> 01:18:47.277
The reason I called
was to ask you a favor.

01:18:50.592 --> 01:18:51.923
A favor?

01:18:53.728 --> 01:18:57.562
Sebastian's gone missing.
He's in a house in Morocco.

01:18:57.632 --> 01:19:01.033
I'm worried about him.
I need you to bring him back.

01:19:02.537 --> 01:19:04.732
You banish me from your house,

01:19:04.806 --> 01:19:08.139
you poison my friendship
with both your children

01:19:08.209 --> 01:19:11.144
and now you expect me
to go begging on your behalf?

01:19:11.212 --> 01:19:13.442
There's no one else I can ask.

01:19:13.781 --> 01:19:14.941
Even if I were to agree,

01:19:15.016 --> 01:19:18.247
what makes you think Sebastian
would take any notice of me?

01:19:18.319 --> 01:19:23.655
Because he cared for you more
than he ever cared for anyone else.

01:19:29.164 --> 01:19:31.962
All I ever wanted was to see them safe.

01:19:32.934 --> 01:19:35.129
And all they do is hate me.

01:19:51.786 --> 01:19:53.720
I'll be at Brideshead.

01:19:55.023 --> 01:19:57.287
You may send word to me there.

01:19:57.825 --> 01:19:59.122
Driver!

01:20:02.297 --> 01:20:03.559
Driver!

01:21:56.944 --> 01:21:59.276
I'm looking for Sebastian Flyte.

01:22:03.785 --> 01:22:05.946
This is his house.

01:22:06.888 --> 01:22:09.516
- Who are you?
- I'm his friend.

01:22:11.693 --> 01:22:13.627
In the local hospital.

01:22:15.430 --> 01:22:17.227
When you see him,

01:22:18.232 --> 01:22:20.427
tell him I'm still here.

01:22:26.774 --> 01:22:29.174
Your friend
has got the grippe.

01:22:31.245 --> 01:22:33.679
One of his lungs is full of fluid.

01:22:34.115 --> 01:22:37.744
He will recover. But travel with you?
Not a chance.

01:22:38.453 --> 01:22:40.887
He's very weak. No resistance.

01:22:42.090 --> 01:22:44.923
What do you expect?
He is an alcoholic.

01:23:15.857 --> 01:23:17.620
Here is your friend.

01:23:34.342 --> 01:23:36.810
What the hell are you doing here?

01:23:37.245 --> 01:23:39.213
Your mother asked me to come.

01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:41.908
She wants me to bring you back home,

01:23:42.683 --> 01:23:46.619
but the doctor said
it's out of the question for you to travel.

01:23:46.921 --> 01:23:49.048
I wouldn't, even if I could.

01:23:49.824 --> 01:23:51.257
I think...

01:23:53.728 --> 01:23:55.628
I think she's dying.

01:24:04.338 --> 01:24:07.364
Walk with me. I'm meant to exercise.

01:24:27.094 --> 01:24:29.085
Did you go to my house?

01:24:30.398 --> 01:24:32.195
Did you meet Kurt?

01:24:33.334 --> 01:24:34.596
Yes.

01:24:36.604 --> 01:24:39.539
He wanted you to know
he was waiting for you.

01:24:40.608 --> 01:24:42.974
It's rather a pleasant change,

01:24:44.045 --> 01:24:47.640
when all your life
you've had people looking after you,

01:24:48.182 --> 01:24:50.878
to have someone to look after, yourself.

01:25:05.399 --> 01:25:07.458
I thought you'd want to go back
to Brideshead one day.

01:25:07.535 --> 01:25:09.002
Brideshead?

01:25:09.604 --> 01:25:11.071
Are you mad?

01:25:12.974 --> 01:25:15.568
The place would still be full of her.

01:25:17.678 --> 01:25:20.909
I wouldn't go within
a hundred miles of the place.

01:25:25.419 --> 01:25:26.943
I need to sit.

01:25:41.469 --> 01:25:42.868
I'm sorry.

01:25:43.704 --> 01:25:45.228
Whatever for?

01:25:55.316 --> 01:25:56.783
Everything.

01:25:57.818 --> 01:25:59.342
It's all right.

01:26:01.022 --> 01:26:02.284
Truly.

01:26:05.092 --> 01:26:07.117
I asked too much of you.

01:26:09.764 --> 01:26:11.891
I knew it all along, really.

01:26:14.001 --> 01:26:16.765
Only God can give you that sort of love.

01:26:24.412 --> 01:26:26.403
Come home, Sebastian.

01:26:28.716 --> 01:26:30.684
When you're well enough.

01:26:32.219 --> 01:26:34.346
Don't finish it like this.

01:26:37.725 --> 01:26:39.488
This is my life now.

01:26:41.896 --> 01:26:43.488
I'm happy here.

01:26:48.436 --> 01:26:49.960
I miss you.

01:26:52.506 --> 01:26:54.701
How sweet of you to say that.

01:26:57.445 --> 01:26:58.969
Dear Charles,

01:27:02.516 --> 01:27:05.610
it was my fault for
bringing you to Brideshead.

01:27:11.158 --> 01:27:12.523
Run away.

01:27:14.695 --> 01:27:17.391
Run far away and don't ever look back.

01:28:11.385 --> 01:28:12.784
I'm sorry.

01:28:40.481 --> 01:28:42.676
You must be so proud of him.

01:28:43.250 --> 01:28:45.514
- Was he away long?
- Two years,

01:28:45.619 --> 01:28:47.348
and it doesn't feel like a day.

01:29:37.271 --> 01:29:38.829
Hello, Charles.

01:29:46.313 --> 01:29:48.611
Did you know I was on the boat?

01:29:50.551 --> 01:29:53.247
If I said no, you wouldn't believe me.

01:29:59.026 --> 01:30:00.789
You're married now.

01:30:01.896 --> 01:30:02.988
Yes.

01:30:08.202 --> 01:30:12.138
- You haven't changed at all.
- Neither have you.

01:30:17.111 --> 01:30:19.443
- How ridiculous.
- Yes, isn't it?

01:30:23.284 --> 01:30:25.184
Tell me this is fate.

01:31:50.037 --> 01:31:51.766
- What?
- Nothing.

01:31:53.240 --> 01:31:54.571
Tell me.

01:31:55.376 --> 01:31:57.810
I was thinking about Sebastian.

01:31:58.612 --> 01:32:01.638
Mummy died without
ever seeing him again.

01:32:05.586 --> 01:32:06.848
I know.

01:32:11.458 --> 01:32:13.358
Let's go up on deck.

01:32:14.228 --> 01:32:17.254
- Are you sure?
- They're all asleep! Come on!

01:32:20.801 --> 01:32:22.166
Come on!

01:32:33.247 --> 01:32:34.441
Sorry.

01:32:38.986 --> 01:32:41.454
- So where's Rex?
- I drowned him.

01:32:42.189 --> 01:32:43.850
Forgive me, Rex!

01:32:58.072 --> 01:33:00.097
Lady Julia, fancy meeting you here.

01:33:00.174 --> 01:33:02.836
- Mr. Ryder.
- Could I possibly get you a drink?

01:33:02.910 --> 01:33:04.138
Dry martini, please.

01:33:04.211 --> 01:33:06.509
One dry Martini,
one whiskey with water.

01:33:06.580 --> 01:33:08.241
Please, allow me.

01:33:18.292 --> 01:33:19.919
So, why did you marry Rex?

01:33:19.994 --> 01:33:22.963
I don't know. Because he wasn't you.

01:33:23.464 --> 01:33:26.524
- Because he was rich.
- Because he was Catholic.

01:33:26.900 --> 01:33:29.733
Because Mummy approved,
God rest her soul.

01:33:31.805 --> 01:33:34.706
I thought he was my painted savage.

01:33:35.876 --> 01:33:38.709
It turns out he was
thoroughly up to date.

01:33:40.981 --> 01:33:42.073
Thank you.

01:33:42.149 --> 01:33:45.141
Now, no more talk about Rex.
He's in England.

01:33:54.094 --> 01:33:57.029
- Do you have children?
- No.

01:33:58.532 --> 01:33:59.692
No.

01:34:03.170 --> 01:34:06.367
- What will you tell your wife?
- Wait until London.

01:34:08.042 --> 01:34:11.842
I have a viewing to arrange.
I'll sort it out. It'll be fine.

01:34:12.646 --> 01:34:15.638
- Where shall we go?
- Somewhere abroad, like Daddy.

01:34:15.716 --> 01:34:18.583
- What about Italy? Capri?
- Antibes.

01:34:18.652 --> 01:34:19.641
- Seville.
- Verona.

01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:21.449
- Paris.
- Brideshead.

01:34:21.522 --> 01:34:23.422
- No!
- Why not?

01:34:24.691 --> 01:34:27.751
- It's the loveliest place on earth.
- I can't go back there.

01:34:27.828 --> 01:34:29.625
- Not after this.
- Nonsense.

01:34:29.696 --> 01:34:32.392
- We've nothing to apologize for.
- No.

01:34:34.535 --> 01:34:36.093
Besides, Rex is there.

01:34:36.170 --> 01:34:39.196
Leave it to me.
I'll settle things with Rex.

01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:42.208
I'll settle everything.

01:34:45.712 --> 01:34:47.009
Trust me.

01:34:48.248 --> 01:34:49.442
I do.

01:34:50.417 --> 01:34:52.749
- And stop worrying!
- I will.

01:35:08.102 --> 01:35:11.094
Good afternoon, ma'am.
- Lovely day.

01:35:14.108 --> 01:35:15.837
Mr. and Mrs. Ryder.

01:35:17.144 --> 01:35:20.875
Look, that's the Duke
and Duchess of Clarence.

01:35:21.415 --> 01:35:24.782
- They want to buy one!
- How very gracious of them.

01:35:26.954 --> 01:35:31.653
Make an effort, Charles.
I've got you the cream of Mayfair.

01:35:34.962 --> 01:35:36.657
Mrs. Ryder, good day.

01:35:36.730 --> 01:35:40.257
Charles, how charming you look.

01:35:43.370 --> 01:35:44.632
Anthony.

01:35:45.139 --> 01:35:48.302
I heard, quite by chance, at a luncheon,
that you were having an exhibition.

01:35:48.375 --> 01:35:52.368
So, of course, I dashed impetuously
to the shrine to pay homage.

01:35:52.779 --> 01:35:54.679
Where are the pictures?

01:35:56.316 --> 01:35:58.409
Let me explain them to you.

01:36:09.296 --> 01:36:10.820
This is simply charm.

01:36:10.898 --> 01:36:15.392
Simple, creamy, English charm,
playing tigers.

01:36:18.338 --> 01:36:20.329
But enough of art.

01:36:20.407 --> 01:36:24.571
They tell me you are happy in love
and that is everything, isn't it?

01:36:24.645 --> 01:36:26.670
Or nearly everything.

01:36:28.048 --> 01:36:30.175
Everyone's talking about it.

01:36:30.250 --> 01:36:33.742
So, it's Julia now.
And it used to be Sebastian.

01:36:34.988 --> 01:36:37.286
Do you think I should warn her?

01:36:37.591 --> 01:36:39.525
Warn her about what?

01:36:40.627 --> 01:36:45.030
How apropos that you'd have
chosen jungles for your canvas.

01:36:47.201 --> 01:36:49.999
I always thought you
were the lamb to be slaughtered,

01:36:50.070 --> 01:36:52.903
when all along it is they
who are hunted.

01:36:54.541 --> 01:36:58.944
There really is no end to your hunger,
is there, Charles?

01:37:17.464 --> 01:37:20.126
Why do I feel so nervous?
- Don't be.

01:37:26.139 --> 01:37:30.132
- Who are all these people?
- Politicians, money men.

01:37:30.877 --> 01:37:32.674
Rex thinks there's a war
coming with Hitler.

01:37:32.746 --> 01:37:34.509
He wants to do well out of it.

01:37:34.581 --> 01:37:37.311
- It's all he talks about.
- Hello, Julia.

01:37:37.384 --> 01:37:39.545
- Hello, Rex.
- Good evening, Rex.

01:37:39.620 --> 01:37:42.145
Mr. Ryder,
welcome back to Brideshead.

01:37:42.222 --> 01:37:44.782
I hear you're making
quite a name for yourself.

01:37:44.858 --> 01:37:48.259
- Could I have a word with you?
- Later, I have guests.

01:37:54.901 --> 01:37:56.266
It's cold.

01:38:03.010 --> 01:38:04.443
Not here!

01:38:07.714 --> 01:38:10.615
- Sorry.
- Let's go back to London.

01:38:10.684 --> 01:38:14.347
- Let me settle everything with Rex.
- And then we'll leave?

01:38:15.022 --> 01:38:17.820
- Yes? Charles?
- Yes.

01:38:19.526 --> 01:38:21.551
If that's what you want.

01:38:33.407 --> 01:38:35.102
Hello, Bridey.

01:38:35.175 --> 01:38:38.144
- Hello, Julia. Just up from London?
- Yes.

01:38:38.912 --> 01:38:41.176
Welcome back to Brideshead, Charles.

01:38:41.248 --> 01:38:44.046
- How's your family?
- Fine, thank you.

01:38:45.652 --> 01:38:49.179
- Rex still entertaining?
- He's got business.

01:38:52.926 --> 01:38:55.793
I'm sorry he's not here.
I have a little announcement to make.

01:38:55.862 --> 01:38:57.796
Well, come on. Out with it.

01:38:57.864 --> 01:39:01.391
- I'm engaged to be married.
- Congratulations, Bridey.

01:39:01.468 --> 01:39:04.028
Well, who is she?

01:39:04.104 --> 01:39:06.698
- No one you know.
- Is she pretty?

01:39:07.207 --> 01:39:10.301
I don't think you could
exactly call her pretty.

01:39:10.410 --> 01:39:13.470
"Comely" is the word
I think of in her connection.

01:39:13.547 --> 01:39:15.378
She is a big woman.

01:39:15.449 --> 01:39:17.212
- Fat?
- No, big.

01:39:17.918 --> 01:39:20.978
She's called Mrs. Muspratt.
Her Christian name is Beryl.

01:39:21.054 --> 01:39:23.181
But, Bridey, where did you find her?

01:39:23.256 --> 01:39:27.056
Her late husband, Admiral Muspratt,
collected matchboxes.

01:39:27.494 --> 01:39:30.895
You're not marrying her
for her matchboxes, are you, Bridey?

01:39:30.964 --> 01:39:32.192
No, no.

01:39:32.699 --> 01:39:34.599
Matchboxes were left
to Falmouth Town Library.

01:39:34.668 --> 01:39:38.365
I'm just holding them for collection.
Why are you laughing?

01:39:38.972 --> 01:39:41.736
- I hope you'll be very happy.
- Thank you.

01:39:42.342 --> 01:39:45.709
- I think I'm very fortunate.
- You sly, old thing.

01:39:45.779 --> 01:39:47.940
When are we going to meet her?
You must bring her here.

01:39:48.014 --> 01:39:49.743
- I couldn't do that.
- Why not?

01:39:49.816 --> 01:39:50.874
Well, you must understand,

01:39:50.951 --> 01:39:53.852
Beryl is a woman
of strict Catholic principle,

01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:57.185
fortified by the prejudices
of the middle classes.

01:39:57.257 --> 01:39:59.782
I couldn't possibly bring her here.

01:40:00.427 --> 01:40:01.724
I don't understand.

01:40:01.795 --> 01:40:03.194
It may be a matter of indifference
to you,

01:40:03.263 --> 01:40:06.357
whether or not you choose
to live in sin with Charles,

01:40:06.433 --> 01:40:09.891
but on no account would Beryl
consent to be your guest.

01:40:10.437 --> 01:40:12.997
How dare you talk to her like that?

01:40:15.242 --> 01:40:17.802
Bloody offensive thing to say!

01:40:17.878 --> 01:40:19.402
Really, there was nothing
she could object to.

01:40:19.479 --> 01:40:22.573
I was merely stating
a fact well known to her.

01:40:43.537 --> 01:40:46.097
Take no notice of him, my darling.

01:40:48.975 --> 01:40:49.964
So,

01:40:51.645 --> 01:40:54.170
got you. Sorry about the delay.

01:40:55.215 --> 01:40:56.978
I'll be outside.

01:41:09.129 --> 01:41:13.122
The door? Door's made
from all the works of Dickens.

01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:16.260
I had it installed especially. Want one?

01:41:17.437 --> 01:41:18.995
No, thank you.

01:41:23.376 --> 01:41:25.571
I know what you're thinking.

01:41:29.850 --> 01:41:33.013
How vulgar can it get?
You wanna know the secret?

01:41:38.191 --> 01:41:40.022
I do it on purpose.

01:41:40.093 --> 01:41:43.494
It amuses me to offend
their delicate sensibilities.

01:41:45.031 --> 01:41:47.499
So, you wanna take my wife off me?

01:41:47.567 --> 01:41:50.764
You know she can't marry
a divorcé, right?

01:41:51.271 --> 01:41:54.172
- Against the rules.
- Well, at least she'll be free of you.

01:41:54.241 --> 01:41:55.708
She'll never be free.

01:41:55.775 --> 01:41:57.436
Don't pretend
you've been faithful to her.

01:41:57.511 --> 01:41:59.274
Who said anything about faith?

01:41:59.346 --> 01:42:03.510
I bet you'd love to get your hands
on the house, though, wouldn't you?

01:42:03.583 --> 01:42:07.178
All those pretty paintings.
All those pretty views.

01:42:07.254 --> 01:42:10.087
Let her go, Rex. You never loved her.

01:42:10.156 --> 01:42:12.351
The only thing you ever had
in common was religion.

01:42:12.425 --> 01:42:15.292
Wrong. When I decided to marry Julia,
I wasn't a Catholic.

01:42:15.362 --> 01:42:17.694
I converted before the wedding.

01:42:19.466 --> 01:42:21.730
Bet she didn't tell you that.

01:42:22.202 --> 01:42:25.000
- I guessed.
- Oh, yeah?

01:42:26.273 --> 01:42:27.968
You're the type.

01:42:33.213 --> 01:42:34.771
You people,

01:42:36.416 --> 01:42:38.213
you never learn.

01:42:40.453 --> 01:42:43.445
You could have had it all
if you'd been a little more flexible.

01:42:43.523 --> 01:42:44.888
I did what I had to do.

01:42:44.958 --> 01:42:47.119
They want a Catholic,
I'll convert to Catholicism.

01:42:47.193 --> 01:42:48.319
It's a great religion.

01:42:48.395 --> 01:42:52.092
You sin all you want, then you confess.
Problem solved.

01:42:52.165 --> 01:42:54.258
You gotta woo these people.

01:42:55.101 --> 01:42:56.625
This family don't live in the real world.

01:42:56.703 --> 01:43:00.161
- They're mortgaged up to the hilt.
- Get to the point.

01:43:07.213 --> 01:43:10.512
You want my wife? Make me an offer.

01:43:11.217 --> 01:43:15.119
- I'm not just giving her away.
- Don't do this. It's demeaning.

01:43:16.957 --> 01:43:18.754
Try a little harder.

01:43:20.894 --> 01:43:22.794
You're a rich man, Rex,
you've already got what you wanted.

01:43:22.862 --> 01:43:25.797
You can never have enough
of what you want.

01:43:30.470 --> 01:43:32.131
No, you're right.

01:43:32.706 --> 01:43:35.504
You're taking her off my hands.
That's a favor.

01:43:35.575 --> 01:43:38.100
I'll tell you what I'll do.

01:43:39.245 --> 01:43:45.150
You give me a couple of your jungle
pics, and I'll give you an annulment.

01:43:45.218 --> 01:43:47.652
I hear you're worth collecting.

01:43:52.692 --> 01:43:56.150
Come on, Charlie boy, say yes.
You know you want to.

01:43:58.732 --> 01:44:00.757
You don't have to speak.

01:44:04.004 --> 01:44:05.369
Just nod.

01:44:23.790 --> 01:44:25.280
I'll have my driver take me to London.

01:44:25.358 --> 01:44:28.293
He can pick up the paintings
in the morning.

01:44:37.137 --> 01:44:40.834
You know she's mad.
Can't even give you children.

01:44:42.876 --> 01:44:44.776
Lost the only one we had.

01:45:05.265 --> 01:45:06.459
Julia?

01:45:26.553 --> 01:45:28.646
I'm so sorry. I didn't know.

01:45:30.757 --> 01:45:33.157
- It's just a shock.
- Shh.

01:45:33.393 --> 01:45:35.258
Shh. Don't.

01:45:37.897 --> 01:45:40.559
I've always known, ever since nursery.

01:45:42.168 --> 01:45:45.797
I tried to be good, I really did.
I tried. I married Rex.

01:45:46.906 --> 01:45:49.704
All through the backgammon
and cigars, I tried.

01:45:49.776 --> 01:45:53.405
But it's not enough. It's never enough.

01:45:55.482 --> 01:45:57.279
God had to punish me.

01:45:58.451 --> 01:46:00.942
So he took my little stillborn...

01:46:01.421 --> 01:46:03.651
My child. My girl.

01:46:05.158 --> 01:46:08.218
With you, I thought I could
really and truly be free.

01:46:08.294 --> 01:46:11.127
But coming back here, it's like a thread,

01:46:11.197 --> 01:46:15.224
an invisible thread drawing you back,
inch by inch,

01:46:16.102 --> 01:46:19.037
until all of a sudden,
you're a child again.

01:46:19.706 --> 01:46:21.264
And that voice inside your head,

01:46:21.341 --> 01:46:24.469
the one that Mummy planted
all those years ago in the nursery,

01:46:24.544 --> 01:46:27.536
every night in the nursery,
filling your head with it.

01:46:27.614 --> 01:46:29.809
And the voice is telling you,
whispering,

01:46:29.883 --> 01:46:33.080
"Wicked little Julia,
bad little girl, living in sin."

01:46:33.153 --> 01:46:36.179
And here I am again with you,
living in sin.

01:46:39.325 --> 01:46:41.384
It's over. It's over now.

01:47:02.215 --> 01:47:04.581
- Everything set?
- That's everything, sir.

01:47:04.651 --> 01:47:07.313
- Thank you, Wilcox.
- Best of luck, sir.

01:47:32.212 --> 01:47:33.645
Who's that?

01:47:38.117 --> 01:47:40.881
Go back. Turn around.
I have to go back.

01:47:43.957 --> 01:47:46.255
- Staff, immediately!
- Yes, sir.

01:47:47.760 --> 01:47:49.694
Come on, quickly now!

01:47:53.666 --> 01:47:55.463
I'll help with that.

01:47:56.302 --> 01:47:57.769
Come on, hurry!
- Yes, sir.

01:47:57.837 --> 01:47:59.202
Shall I help, Tompkins?
- Hurry!

01:47:59.272 --> 01:48:02.605
The sedan chair.
- Right, very gently. Very gently.

01:48:04.777 --> 01:48:06.711
Hurry.
- Get a move with the chair.

01:48:06.779 --> 01:48:08.770
Come along, come along.

01:48:09.649 --> 01:48:11.549
Somebody got the rug?

01:48:13.953 --> 01:48:15.386
Up. Gently.

01:48:15.755 --> 01:48:19.452
Clear the stairs, please.
- Could I have the medical bag?

01:48:21.728 --> 01:48:24.253
- Father!
- Dear Julia.

01:48:24.764 --> 01:48:26.789
Come on, please. Come on!

01:48:35.341 --> 01:48:36.933
I'm sorry, I was to call,

01:48:37.010 --> 01:48:40.138
but we have been traveling
without a stop for three days.

01:48:40.213 --> 01:48:42.238
It was Cordelia,
she was visiting us in Venice...

01:48:42.315 --> 01:48:43.907
What happened?
- We want the bed ready

01:48:43.983 --> 01:48:45.211
as soon as possible.

01:48:45.285 --> 01:48:49.278
His heart. Some long word at the heart.

01:48:49.789 --> 01:48:51.086
Hurry up.

01:48:52.158 --> 01:48:53.591
He's dying.

01:48:54.427 --> 01:48:56.395
He has come home to die.

01:49:00.934 --> 01:49:02.595
Come on, everybody, that's it.
Chop-chop.

01:49:02.669 --> 01:49:03.658
Come along.

01:49:03.736 --> 01:49:06.136
We must get Lord Marchmain
to the great dining room.

01:49:15.248 --> 01:49:16.738
Thank you.

01:49:24.157 --> 01:49:25.715
He's sleeping.

01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:29.721
Do you think we should
let Sebastian know?

01:49:29.796 --> 01:49:32.162
You could, but I doubt he'd come.

01:49:32.231 --> 01:49:35.792
The last I heard of him,
he was still struggling rather.

01:49:36.102 --> 01:49:39.401
The monks have him as a porter
in the hospital in Morocco.

01:49:39.472 --> 01:49:41.235
He seems to like it.

01:49:41.374 --> 01:49:45.003
I think they've rather taken him
under their wing, dear old thing.

01:49:45.078 --> 01:49:48.570
Still, salvation of a sort.

01:49:50.883 --> 01:49:53.579
Bridey, you need to call for a priest.

01:49:54.420 --> 01:49:56.854
I'll have a word with Father Mackay
about dropping in this evening.

01:49:56.923 --> 01:49:59.619
Julia, your father doesn't want a priest.

01:50:00.159 --> 01:50:02.684
All he wants is to die in his old home.

01:50:02.762 --> 01:50:08.064
Our father's soul, all sinners' souls,
face mortal danger.

01:50:09.068 --> 01:50:12.299
It is our duty as Catholics
to see that we do all in our power

01:50:12.372 --> 01:50:15.637
to save those we love from themselves.

01:50:57.817 --> 01:50:59.409
Hateful woman.

01:51:00.586 --> 01:51:02.383
She wants me dead.

01:51:05.058 --> 01:51:06.719
What about you?

01:51:07.760 --> 01:51:10.661
- Do you want me dead?
- No.

01:51:19.872 --> 01:51:22.739
You know the family
are sending for a priest.

01:51:22.809 --> 01:51:26.336
They seem determined
to drag God into it.

01:51:27.513 --> 01:51:29.538
Why should you care?

01:51:30.249 --> 01:51:32.274
You don't believe in God.

01:51:33.486 --> 01:51:35.351
You said so yourself.

01:51:37.390 --> 01:51:40.154
Have you suddenly
become my conscience?

01:51:42.295 --> 01:51:45.230
I've already seen Sebastian
ruined by God.

01:51:45.298 --> 01:51:49.997
I don't see why I should watch it
happen again with your daughter.

01:51:51.904 --> 01:51:54.236
How very caring of you.

01:51:55.541 --> 01:51:57.566
You forget, I was there.

01:51:58.644 --> 01:52:01.807
I watched that woman crucify my son,

01:52:02.215 --> 01:52:05.673
little by little, and I was silent.

01:52:07.753 --> 01:52:10.244
What does that say about me?

01:52:10.323 --> 01:52:12.655
You're not responsible
for what she did.

01:52:12.725 --> 01:52:16.491
But are we not also
our brother's keeper?

01:52:17.830 --> 01:52:20.856
You, Charles, and me?

01:52:24.270 --> 01:52:26.238
I let Sebastian down.

01:52:29.175 --> 01:52:31.143
I let everyone down.

01:52:35.748 --> 01:52:37.306
This way, sir.

01:52:47.527 --> 01:52:49.119
Dear, no, that's too many!

01:52:49.195 --> 01:52:51.288
- Papa...
- Your father needs to rest!

01:52:51.364 --> 01:52:53.559
- Get him away.
- I've brought Father Mackay to see you.

01:52:53.633 --> 01:52:57.660
- Get him away! Get him away!
- Out!

01:52:57.737 --> 01:53:00.262
Everybody out! Out! Out!

01:53:01.607 --> 01:53:05.839
- I'm so sorry, Father.
- Not at all. Give him time.

01:53:05.912 --> 01:53:09.075
I've known worse cases
make beautiful deaths.

01:53:13.319 --> 01:53:16.083
What were you talking
to my father about?

01:53:20.193 --> 01:53:22.184
He doesn't want a priest.

01:53:24.397 --> 01:53:26.024
Please, Charles.

01:53:26.432 --> 01:53:29.697
Please don't interfere with matters
that don't concern you.

01:53:29.769 --> 01:53:31.100
Julia...

01:53:35.241 --> 01:53:37.175
Let's get out of here.

01:53:37.243 --> 01:53:39.006
We'll go to Italy.

01:53:40.313 --> 01:53:43.476
- Capri.
- I can't leave now, my father's dying.

01:53:44.884 --> 01:53:48.376
When this is over,
I can make you happy.

01:54:03.402 --> 01:54:06.997
- Why should I believe you?
- Believe me.

01:54:07.573 --> 01:54:09.734
You just bought me from Rex.

01:54:14.146 --> 01:54:16.171
What are you talking about?

01:54:16.249 --> 01:54:18.979
According to you,
I'm worth two pictures.

01:54:21.787 --> 01:54:24.347
I thought I'd fetch at least three.

01:54:26.525 --> 01:54:28.516
Don't be ridiculous.

01:54:30.997 --> 01:54:33.898
- That was Rex.
- You agreed to it, Charles.

01:54:34.600 --> 01:54:36.795
- I had no choice!
- You agreed!

01:54:36.869 --> 01:54:37.893
I thought I was doing the right thing.

01:54:37.970 --> 01:54:38.994
I thought I was doing what you wanted.

01:54:39.071 --> 01:54:42.768
No, you thought you were getting me
and the house, together.

01:54:42.842 --> 01:54:46.642
- Is that really what you think?
- You tell me. Please, tell me.

01:54:46.712 --> 01:54:49.340
What does Charles Ryder really want?

01:55:10.303 --> 01:55:14.672
Can you imagine what it was like
for me to be invited into Brideshead?

01:55:17.076 --> 01:55:18.407
Me,

01:55:20.179 --> 01:55:21.942
Charles Ryder,

01:55:23.082 --> 01:55:27.018
"the painter from Paddington,"
as your mother so sweetly put it.

01:55:28.054 --> 01:55:30.921
There was no humiliation
I would not have endured

01:55:30.990 --> 01:55:33.322
just to be part of that dream.

01:55:34.694 --> 01:55:39.154
And your mother, that woman is more
alive now than she ever was.

01:55:39.231 --> 01:55:43.895
She's in every brick,
every stone, every slate.

01:55:48.774 --> 01:55:50.605
Sebastian was right.

01:55:58.884 --> 01:56:00.875
We should run away.

01:56:03.923 --> 01:56:07.620
- Why did you bring me here?
- We can still leave.

01:56:54.607 --> 01:56:57.235
- Bridey...
- Don't interfere, Charles.

01:57:23.803 --> 01:57:28.467
Now, try and remember your sins
and tell God you're sorry.

01:57:29.008 --> 01:57:31.704
I'm going to give you absolution now.

01:57:31.777 --> 01:57:33.574
And while I'm giving it,

01:57:33.646 --> 01:57:36.638
I want you to tell God you're sorry
you offended him,

01:57:36.715 --> 01:57:40.207
and then I want you
to make a sign, if you can.

01:57:51.630 --> 01:57:53.621
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:58:22.995 --> 01:58:24.189
Amen.

01:58:39.945 --> 01:58:44.075
Please, God,
please, if you're there, forgive him.

01:58:45.284 --> 01:58:49.448
Forgive me. Oh, God, forgive me.
Let him have a sign.

02:00:31.757 --> 02:00:34.453
Sebastian used to loathe this painting.

02:00:37.029 --> 02:00:39.964
Daddy gave it to Mummy
as a wedding present.

02:00:43.669 --> 02:00:44.931
Tell me.

02:00:49.875 --> 02:00:53.333
I wanted too much.

02:00:55.914 --> 02:00:57.677
It's nobody's fault.

02:00:58.150 --> 02:01:01.313
But you're not coming with me.

02:01:06.825 --> 02:01:09.521
I can't shut myself off from His mercy.

02:01:12.464 --> 02:01:14.489
Can you understand that?

02:01:17.770 --> 02:01:20.898
I don't want to make it easier for you.

02:01:28.313 --> 02:01:31.339
I hope your heart

02:01:33.285 --> 02:01:34.650
breaks.

02:01:41.760 --> 02:01:43.557
But I do understand.

02:01:49.435 --> 02:01:51.266
I have to let you go.

02:03:10.849 --> 02:03:14.546
<i>Whether by fate or the</i>
<i>divine ironies of some higher power,</i>

02:03:16.054 --> 02:03:19.785
<i>I find myself returned once more</i>
<i>to Brideshead.</i>

02:03:19.858 --> 02:03:21.382
Let it go.

02:03:33.338 --> 02:03:36.205
<i>Did I want too much?</i>

02:03:39.111 --> 02:03:40.635
Get him out of my sight!

02:03:40.712 --> 02:03:45.012
<i>Did my own hunger blind me to</i>
<i>the ties that bound them to their faith?</i>

02:03:47.786 --> 02:03:52.985
<i>Am I only now, shadowed by war,</i>
<i>all moorings gone,</i>

02:03:55.694 --> 02:03:58.026
<i>alone enough to see the light?</i>

02:04:06.104 --> 02:04:07.628
Worst place we've struck yet.

02:04:07.706 --> 02:04:09.230
No facilities, no amenities,

02:04:09.308 --> 02:04:12.141
and the nearest village
is a five-mile walk.

02:04:12.211 --> 02:04:14.543
Mind you, there's a rumor
of a big push coming.

02:04:14.613 --> 02:04:16.877
They'll be shipping
us off to France soon.

02:04:16.949 --> 02:04:18.541
Yes, very soon.

02:04:20.118 --> 02:04:22.518
Where are the family now?
Does anyone know?

02:04:22.588 --> 02:04:25.557
Some Lady Flyte lives
on her own here, normally.

02:04:25.624 --> 02:04:27.683
She's overseas
with the women's service.

02:04:27.759 --> 02:04:31.490
Her elder brother died in the Blitz.
They're all Roman Catholic.

02:04:32.097 --> 02:04:36.659
- I take it you're not religious, Hooper.
- Me? God, no. Can't see the point in it.

02:04:36.735 --> 02:04:39.431
You're born, you live, then you die.

02:04:42.441 --> 02:04:44.204
Do you have any hopes
for the future, Hooper?

02:04:44.276 --> 02:04:46.301
Hopes? Oh, aye, plenty.

02:04:46.945 --> 02:04:51.075
It's our time now. You watch.
The old ways, all this, they're gone.

02:04:51.550 --> 02:04:54.815
Future belongs to us,
so long as we don't get shot.

02:04:56.288 --> 02:04:57.585
How about you, sir?

02:04:57.656 --> 02:04:59.521
You got someone
special waiting for you?

02:04:59.591 --> 02:05:01.320
Me? No.

02:05:02.427 --> 02:05:05.555
I've loved and lost
for more than one lifetime.

02:05:07.232 --> 02:05:09.427
Would you like me
to drive you back, sir?

02:05:09.501 --> 02:05:12.299
No, not yet. Carry on, Hooper.

02:05:12.738 --> 02:05:14.330
Very good, sir.

02:05:23.882 --> 02:05:25.679
Sergeant!

02:06:25.680 --> 02:06:26.680
