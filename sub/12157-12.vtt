WEBVTT

00:02.435 --> 00:04.038
HEY, DAD, CHECK IT OUT--

00:04.072 --> 00:05.206
OUR SCHOOL'S QUARTERBACK,
GREG ARCHER,

00:05.238 --> 00:08.008
HAS NARROWED HIS CHOICE
OF COLLEGES DOWN TO FIVE.

00:08.041 --> 00:09.977
BOY, THAT KID'S
QUITE AN ATHLETE, HUH?
YEAH.

00:10.010 --> 00:12.012
MANDY'S TRIED SOME OF
HER BETTER MOVES ON HIM.

00:12.045 --> 00:13.981
BUT HE'S A GOOD
OPEN-FIELD RUNNER.

00:14.014 --> 00:15.282
HE ALWAYS GETS AWAY.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.985
SO YOU LIKE
THIS BOY, MANDY?

00:19.019 --> 00:21.021
UGH, SO DO ALL
THE OTHER GIRLS IN MY SCHOOL.

00:21.055 --> 00:24.024
AND MOST OF THE GUYS
IN DRAMA CLUB.

00:24.058 --> 00:27.027
AND MISS JENSEN,
THE LIBRARIAN...

00:27.061 --> 00:29.029
UH, BEFORE SHE GOT FIRED.

00:29.063 --> 00:31.231
YEAH. THIS KID'S
BEEN TO A LIBRARY.

00:31.265 --> 00:34.034
DEFINITELY NOT HER TYPE.

00:34.068 --> 00:37.071
IT'S TOO BAD. THIS GUY'S GOT
A LOT OF POSSIBILITIES.

00:37.105 --> 00:39.039
UNLIKE THE PARADE OF LOSERS

00:39.073 --> 00:40.074
USUALLY SNIFFIN' AROUND
YOU GIRLS.

00:40.108 --> 00:41.242
MORNIN', BAXTERS.

00:41.274 --> 00:44.245
HERE'S THE GRAND MARSHAL.

00:44.277 --> 00:45.246
YOU BRING IT?
YEP.

00:45.278 --> 00:47.081
BRAND-NEW, LASER-SIGHTED
RIFLE SCOPE.

00:47.115 --> 00:49.015
HEY, KYLE.
HEY.

00:49.049 --> 00:51.351
IT'S RABBIT SEASON, BOY,
AND FUR IS GONNA BE FLYIN'.

00:51.384 --> 00:53.053
THERE'S A LITTLE "POP-POP,"

00:53.087 --> 00:55.288
AND THEN
THAT FUR JUST LAYS THERE.

00:55.323 --> 00:57.957
THANK GOD WE'VE GOT ENGINEERS
WORKING DAY AND NIGHT

00:57.990 --> 01:01.295
TO IMPROVE OUR ODDS
AGAINST THE MIGHTY RABBIT.

01:01.328 --> 01:03.030
I COME FROM
A GENERATION OF HUNTERS

01:03.063 --> 01:05.266
WHO ARE TIRED OF BUGS BUNNY
EMBARRASSING ELMER FUDD.

01:05.298 --> 01:07.935
IT'S PAYBACK TIME, BABY.
PAYBACK.

01:07.968 --> 01:11.139
HERE.
LET ME GET THAT, KRISTIN.

01:13.173 --> 01:15.042
YOU KNOW, YOU TRIED TO
"GET THAT" WHEN YOU WERE DATING.

01:15.075 --> 01:16.976
I THINK IT'S TIME
TO LEAVE IT ALONE.

01:17.009 --> 01:20.381
THANK YOU, KYLE.
GENTLEMAN, AS ALWAYS.

01:20.413 --> 01:22.282
HEY, DAD, DO YOU THINK
I COULD USE THAT SCOPE

01:22.316 --> 01:24.952
TO TAKE OUT THAT GOPHER
IN THE BACKYARD?

01:24.984 --> 01:27.121
SO NOW WE'RE AT WAR WITH
ALL HARMLESS LITTLE CREATURES?

01:27.155 --> 01:28.956
UH, IF YOU ROLLED YOUR ANKLE
IN A GOPHER HOLE,

01:28.988 --> 01:30.990
YOU'D BE GUNNIN' UP, TOO.

01:32.459 --> 01:34.094
HEY-O!

01:34.128 --> 01:38.098
UGH. SPEAKING OF HAIRY RODENTS
WHO'VE BECOME QUITE ANNOYING...

01:38.132 --> 01:39.999
UH, ARE THESE FOR ANYBODY?
(crunches)

01:40.032 --> 01:42.969
IT'S OUR FAULT FOR LEAVING
FOOD LYING AROUND.

01:43.002 --> 01:44.070
IS BOYD READY FOR SCHOOL?

01:44.104 --> 01:45.338
ALMOST. RYAN,
YOU REMEMBER KYLE?

01:45.373 --> 01:46.939
HEY, MAN.
OH, YEAH.

01:46.973 --> 01:48.408
THE GUY
WHO HUMILIATED HIMSELF

01:48.441 --> 01:50.244
BY PROPOSING TO YOU
LAST CHRISTMAS?

01:50.278 --> 01:54.046
(chuckles) CLASSIC.

01:55.283 --> 01:57.950
I PREFER TO REMEMBER
THE POSITIVES OF THAT NIGHT.

01:57.984 --> 02:00.120
BAXTERS GAVE ME A $20 GIFT CARD
TO FUNANIGAN'S.

02:00.120 --> 02:04.124
HEY. OH, WOW.
HEY, RYAN, KYLE. HI.

02:04.158 --> 02:06.260
MORNING, MRS. B. HI, MANDY.
HEY.

02:06.293 --> 02:08.328
HEY, CAN YOU GO SEE
IF BOYD IS DRESSED?

02:08.362 --> 02:10.263
SURE, HONEY.
IT'S--IT'S "KRISTIN."

02:10.297 --> 02:11.298
"SURE, KRISTIN."

02:13.033 --> 02:15.268
ALL RIGHT, WELL, I BETTER HIT IT
BEFORE THAT SCOPE GETS MOUNTED.

02:15.302 --> 02:18.037
I DO NOT ENJOY THE GAME WITH
THE LITTLE RED DOT ON MY CHEST.

02:18.070 --> 02:20.174
DON'T.

02:20.208 --> 02:21.442
(laughs)

02:21.474 --> 02:23.010
OH, YOU'RE SO GOOD AT IT,
THOUGH.

02:23.042 --> 02:25.012
YOU ALMOST GOT IT
THIS TIME!

02:25.044 --> 02:28.047
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO
PICK ON KYLE?

02:28.080 --> 02:30.283
BECAUSE RYAN LEFT THE ROOM.

02:30.318 --> 02:32.952
WHEN ARE YOU GIRLS
GONNA DATE A GO-GETTER?

02:32.985 --> 02:35.356
I MEAN, A GUY THAT MIGHT
ACTUALLY TAKE CARE OF YOU?

02:35.388 --> 02:38.024
(both) TAKE CARE OF US?

02:38.057 --> 02:39.959
YEAH. I MEAN SOMEBODY
WITH AMBITION.

02:39.992 --> 02:42.028
WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL,
I HAD ALL SORTS OF JOBS.

02:42.061 --> 02:44.964
I WAS WORKING ALL THE TIME--
MOWING LAWNS, RAKING LEAVES.

02:44.997 --> 02:49.169
TEENAGE BOYS WERE
THE ILLEGAL ALIENS OF THE '70s.

02:49.203 --> 02:52.004
MIKE, WE DIDN'T RAISE OUR GIRLS

02:52.038 --> 02:54.308
TO BELIEVE THEY NEED A MAN
TO TAKE CARE OF THEM.

02:54.342 --> 02:57.177
THEN IT'LL COME
AS A COMPLETE SURPRISE.

02:59.011 --> 03:00.180
DAD, YOU TAUGHT US
TO BE SELF-SUFFICIENT.

03:00.180 --> 03:03.216
AND YET YOU'RE ALL
STILL HERE.

03:03.251 --> 03:05.386
I'M 14.

03:05.418 --> 03:06.986
I HAVE A CHILD.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.257
I'M HERE A LOT LESS
THAN YOU THINK.

03:18.097 --> 03:20.032
HEY, ED,
I GOT A PROMOTIONAL IDEA.

03:20.067 --> 03:21.167
I'M ALL EARS.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.271
IT JUST LOOKS LIKE THAT
'CAUSE YOU GOT NO HAIR.

03:25.072 --> 03:27.039
LISTEN, SEE THE BLOND KID
OUT HERE?
YEAH.

03:27.074 --> 03:30.210
HE'S NOT ONE OF OUR GUYS.
HE STILL HAS LIFE IN HIS EYES.

03:30.244 --> 03:32.079
RIGHT. I WANNA HIRE HIM.

03:32.111 --> 03:33.347
YOU MEAN YOU WANNA
HIRE SOMEBODY

03:33.381 --> 03:35.249
TO STAND AROUND THE STORE
AND LOOK PRETTY?

03:35.283 --> 03:37.385
NO, THAT'S MY JOB.

03:37.418 --> 03:39.219
NO, THIS KID
IS THE BEST QUARTERBACK

03:39.253 --> 03:41.187
WOODBRIDGE HIGH HAS EVER SEEN.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.956
HE'S LIKE A LOCAL CELEBRITY.
THIS IS MARKETING 101.

03:43.991 --> 03:45.426
ON NATIONAL SIGNING DAY,
HE CAN PICK HIS COLLEGE,

03:45.458 --> 03:48.262
AND PUT IT ON TV
RIGHT HERE AT OUTDOOR MAN.

03:48.296 --> 03:50.230
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, I LOVE THAT IDEA.

03:50.264 --> 03:52.232
WHAT'S NATIONAL SIGNING DAY?

03:52.266 --> 03:54.368
ED, NATIONAL SIGNING DAY
FOR HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETES,

03:54.402 --> 03:55.968
WHERE THEY PICK THE COLLEGES

03:56.003 --> 03:57.371
THAT GAVE 'EM THE MOST MONEY
UNDER THE TABLE.

03:57.405 --> 03:59.105
OH. (chuckles)

03:59.138 --> 04:01.308
OH, MIKE,
IT WAS DIFFERENT IN MY DAY.

04:01.342 --> 04:02.409
THE ONLY PERK YOU GOT

04:02.443 --> 04:04.378
WAS A WINK FROM
YOUR FAVORITE GAL IN THE STANDS

04:04.411 --> 04:06.246
AND A PAT ON THE RUMP
FROM THE COACH.

04:06.280 --> 04:07.381
YEAH. YEAH.

04:07.414 --> 04:11.218
YOU PLAYED CLARINET
IN THE MARCHING BAND, RIGHT?

04:11.251 --> 04:13.086
SO WHAT'S WITH YOU
AND THE COACH?

04:16.256 --> 04:18.157
GREG, LOOKS LIKE
YOU MADE THE TEAM.

04:18.190 --> 04:20.393
GREG ARCHER, THIS IS ED ALZATE,
HE OWNS THE STORE.

04:20.428 --> 04:21.961
PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.
MY PLEASURE.

04:21.995 --> 04:22.962
THANKS FOR
THE OPPORTUNITY, SIR.

04:22.996 --> 04:24.230
GREG ARCHER'S
PUMPED TO BE HERE.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.965
WELL, WE APPRECIATE
YOUR ENTHUSIASM.

04:25.999 --> 04:28.001
GOOD. WHY DON'T YOU GO SEE
LOUISE IN H.R. DOWNSTAIRS?

04:28.034 --> 04:29.235
SIGN SOME PAPERS.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.970
WE DEAL WITH GUNS, SO YOU'RE
GONNA GET FINGERPRINTED.

04:31.004 --> 04:33.941
LOUISE IS ALSO
GONNA PAT YOU DOWN.

04:33.974 --> 04:35.241
HAS--HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THE JOB.

04:35.275 --> 04:39.178
SHE'S GOTTEN A LITTLE HANDSY
SINCE HER HUSBAND PASSED AWAY.

04:39.211 --> 04:41.013
KYLE, THIS IS GREG ARCHER.

04:41.048 --> 04:42.950
KYLE'S GONNA
SHOW YOU THE ROPES.
HOW YOU DOING, MAN?

04:42.983 --> 04:44.116
OH, YEAH. FOLLOW ME.

04:44.150 --> 04:46.152
MOST OF THE ROPES ARE IN BOATING
AND SAILING SUPPLIES.

04:46.185 --> 04:48.956
YOU GOT YOUR COTTON,
YOUR JUTE,

04:48.989 --> 04:51.291
TWINES, NYLON...

04:55.329 --> 04:58.197
SO, YOU PLAY FOOTBALL, HUH?

04:58.230 --> 05:01.969
SPORT OF KINGS.
THE NATIONAL PASTIME.

05:02.002 --> 05:04.037
THE RUMBLE IN THE JUNGLE.

05:04.070 --> 05:07.273
NOPE. IT'S NONE
OF THOSE THINGS.

05:07.307 --> 05:10.043
SO MAINLY WHAT WE DO
AROUND HERE

05:10.076 --> 05:12.979
IS RESTOCK ITEMS
AFTER THEY'VE BEEN SOLD.

05:13.012 --> 05:15.982
STRAIGHTEN UP SHELVES AFTER
THE CUSTOMERS ARE DONE BROWSING.

05:16.015 --> 05:19.018
(chuckles) YEAH, SORRY.
I DON'T WANNA DO THAT.

05:19.052 --> 05:21.954
YEAH, I GET IT.
IT CAN BE A REAL DRAG.

05:21.989 --> 05:24.290
BUT IT'S NOT THAT BAD IF YOU
MAKE IT INTO SORT OF A GAME.

05:24.324 --> 05:27.226
I MEAN... I'M NOT
GOING TO DO THAT.

05:27.259 --> 05:29.363
OH, OKAY.

05:29.397 --> 05:31.999
GAME OVER.
OKAY.

05:32.031 --> 05:34.034
SO WHICH ONE OF THESE TENTS

05:34.066 --> 05:35.134
IS THE MOST COMFORTABLE
TO SLEEP IN?

05:35.167 --> 05:37.971
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.
A CUSTOMER MAY ASK.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.973
NO, I'M GONNA RACK OUT.

05:40.007 --> 05:42.042
GREG ARCHER'S
ACTUALLY PRETTY BEAT.

05:42.074 --> 05:45.012
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE GREG ARCHER.

05:45.045 --> 05:46.346
WAKE ME WHEN IT'S LUNCH.

05:46.380 --> 05:48.147
SURE.

05:48.180 --> 05:50.316
YEAH.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.919
(tent door zips)

05:51.952 --> 05:54.220
GREAT FIRST THREE MINUTES.

05:54.253 --> 05:56.990
OOH. KYLE, HEY.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.324
HEY, MANDY.
HEY.

05:58.358 --> 05:59.927
WOW, YOU LOOK REALLY PRETTY.

05:59.960 --> 06:01.361
AW.
YOU COULD BE A MODEL,

06:01.394 --> 06:03.931
OR WORK IN
A DENTIST'S OFFICE.
AW.

06:03.964 --> 06:06.934
THANK YOU, KYLE. UM,
I'M LOOKING FOR GREG ARCHER.

06:06.966 --> 06:08.268
I HEARD HE WAS
WORKING HERE NOW.

06:08.300 --> 06:10.938
YEAH, I HEARD THAT, TOO.

06:10.970 --> 06:13.039
SO FAR I HAVEN'T
SEEN MUCH OF IT.

06:13.072 --> 06:15.943
BUT EVERYBODY'S PRETTY EXCITED
TO HAVE HIM AROUND.

06:15.975 --> 06:19.011
MR. ALZATE EVEN GAVE HIM
MY LOCKER.

06:19.046 --> 06:21.280
I HAVE TO KEEP
MY LUNCH IN MY POCKETS.

06:23.082 --> 06:25.084
WANT SOME GRAPES?

06:25.118 --> 06:26.186
NO, THANKS.

06:26.218 --> 06:28.055
SO DO YOU KNOW
WHERE HE IS RIGHT NOW, OR...

06:28.087 --> 06:30.390
UH, COULD BE ANYWHERE.

06:30.424 --> 06:32.091
HE MIGHT HAVE GONE OUT
TO GET SOME MEDICINE

06:32.125 --> 06:35.095
FOR THAT GROSS THING
ON HIS LIP.

06:35.127 --> 06:36.295
THIS IS TOO PERFECT.

06:36.328 --> 06:38.230
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET HIM
ALONE FOR MONTHS.

06:38.264 --> 06:40.266
AT SCHOOL, HE'S ALWAYS
SURROUNDED BY SKANKS.

06:40.299 --> 06:45.973
YEAH. WE DON'T GET MANY SKANKS
HERE AT OUTDOOR MAN.

06:46.006 --> 06:48.942
AS A RULE,
SKANKS ARE PRETTY INDOORSY.

06:48.976 --> 06:52.045
BUT NOW THAT
YOUR DAD'S GREG'S BOSS,

06:52.079 --> 06:53.379
THAT MAKES YOU
OFF-LIMITS, RIGHT?

06:53.413 --> 06:56.382
OH, THAT'S REALLY GOOD.
YEAH, I'M OFF-LIMITS.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.217
YOU HAVE TO SAY THAT AROUND HIM,
LIKE, A BUNCH OF TIMES.

06:58.250 --> 07:01.954
BE LIKE, "MANDY'S OFF-LIMITS.
MANDY'S FORBIDDEN."

07:01.989 --> 07:04.090
AND THAT WAY, HE'LL RESPECT
YOUR FATHER'S WISHES

07:04.124 --> 07:05.292
AND STAY AWAY FROM YOU?

07:05.325 --> 07:08.996
(laughs)
KYLE, YOU'RE SO NICE.

07:09.028 --> 07:11.130
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW A BAD BOY THINKS.

07:11.164 --> 07:13.966
I WOULDN'T BE SO SURE.

07:14.001 --> 07:17.069
I'VE GOT SOME SKELETONS
IN MY CLOSET.
OH, YEAH?

07:17.104 --> 07:19.006
HAMSTERS, MOSTLY.

07:20.272 --> 07:23.043
I DON'T KNOW
WHY I KEEP THEM.

07:25.979 --> 07:27.079
I'M GONNA GO
LOOK FOR GREG NOW.

07:27.114 --> 07:30.317
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH THAT FUN HAMSTER STORY.

07:43.329 --> 07:45.032
(clicks, jingles)

07:45.065 --> 07:47.266
WELL, THERE YOU GO,
YOUNG LADY.

07:47.299 --> 07:48.969
POSSIBLY THE ONLY KID
ON THE BLOCK

07:49.002 --> 07:53.272
WITH A $900 SCOPE
ON A $99 PELLET RIFLE.

07:53.305 --> 07:57.110
I'M GONNA BURY THAT GOPHER
IN ONE OF HIS OWN HOLES.

07:57.144 --> 08:00.013
I WONDER IF GOPHERS
GET IRONY.

08:00.047 --> 08:02.215
NOT THE DEAD ONES.

08:02.248 --> 08:05.052
LISTEN, I'D LET YOU USE
ONE OF THE BIG BOYS,

08:05.084 --> 08:08.188
BUT YOU KNOW, YOUR MOM
HAS HER "RULES."

08:08.220 --> 08:10.156
SO, UH, NOW THAT
GREG ARCHER'S AT THE STORE,

08:10.189 --> 08:12.024
I GUESS YOU'VE GOT
SOME INSIDE TRACK

08:12.059 --> 08:13.994
ON GETTING HIM
TO CHOOSE MICHIGAN?

08:14.026 --> 08:15.194
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
SELLS ITSELF.

08:15.228 --> 08:16.963
TOM BRADY, GERALD FORD--

08:16.997 --> 08:20.167
BOTH OF 'EM MARRIED
HOT CHICKS THAT LOVED TO PARTY.

08:20.199 --> 08:22.369
YEAH, GREG ARCHER'S GOOD,

08:22.401 --> 08:23.970
BUT IF HE GOES TO U OF M,

08:24.004 --> 08:25.972
HE BETTER TAKE TONY PEARCE
AND SCOTT McGREGOR WITH HIM.

08:26.006 --> 08:28.041
TONY PROTECTS
GREG'S BLIND SIDE

08:28.075 --> 08:30.177
AND SCOTT CATCHES
EVERY WOUNDED DUCK HE THROWS.

08:30.209 --> 08:31.978
BUT HE NEVER MENTIONS 'EM
IN ANY INTERVIEWS.

08:32.012 --> 08:34.981
IT'S ALWAYS "GREG ARCHER'S IN
THE ZONE. GREG ARCHER'S PUMPED."

08:35.015 --> 08:36.348
TALKS ABOUT HIMSELF
IN THE THIRD PERSON.

08:36.382 --> 08:39.251
YEAH, I NOTICED THAT.

08:39.286 --> 08:41.021
IT'S KIND OF WEIRD,
ISN'T IT?

08:41.054 --> 08:42.022
(sighs) YEAH, I KNOW.

08:42.055 --> 08:43.956
(clicks)
EVE BAXTER OUT.

08:46.959 --> 08:47.927
(door opens)

08:47.960 --> 08:50.297
OH, YEAH.

08:52.398 --> 08:54.366
(Kristin) HEY, BUD.

08:54.400 --> 08:58.938
MOM, WHERE'S AUNT EVE
GOING WITH A GUN?

08:58.971 --> 09:00.540
UH, UP ON THE ROOF,
HONEY.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.975
COOL.

09:04.076 --> 09:06.046
WHAT? WOULD YOU RATHER
I SAID MY SISTER'S

09:06.079 --> 09:08.048
TRYING TO BLOW THE HEAD
OFF OF A GOPHER?

09:08.081 --> 09:10.216
NO, IT'S NOT THAT.
IT'S...

09:10.249 --> 09:12.084
WHAT'S UP
WITH THIS KYLE GUY ANYWAY?

09:12.119 --> 09:16.255
ARE YOU GUYS A...
THING AGAIN?

09:16.289 --> 09:18.291
I'M NOT SURE
THAT'S ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS.

09:18.324 --> 09:23.262
OH. OH, I'M NOT ASKING OUT OF
ANY ROMANTIC INTEREST IN YOU.
OH.

09:23.296 --> 09:25.098
YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S
IMPORTANT, AS BOYD'S FATHER,

09:25.132 --> 09:27.967
THAT THERE NOT BE
A REVOLVING DOOR OF "UNCLES"

09:28.000 --> 09:31.037
RUNNING THROUGH HIS LIFE.
WOW.

09:31.071 --> 09:33.405
SO HAVING A BABY AT 17
MAKES ME EASY?

09:33.439 --> 09:36.076
TRUST ME, NO ONE'S EVER
GONNA CALL YOU "EASY."

09:36.109 --> 09:37.409
WOW.

09:37.443 --> 09:39.212
NO, I-I JUST MEAN YOU'RE--
YOU'RE A DIFFICULT PERSON.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.214
YOU KNOW, ASK ANYBODY.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.216
AGAIN, WOW.

09:43.250 --> 09:47.319
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I SHOULD GO.

09:48.988 --> 09:50.290
NO.

09:50.322 --> 09:52.159
I'M NOT SEEING KYLE.

09:52.192 --> 09:54.094
WE'RE--WE'RE JUST FRIENDS.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.231
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

09:58.265 --> 10:02.069
I BARELY KNOW KYLE.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.972
I MEAN, HE'S CUTE AND ALL,
BUT NOT...

10:06.173 --> 10:10.276
NO. I'M NOT SEEING ANYONE.

10:10.309 --> 10:12.378
(door closes)

10:15.015 --> 10:16.282
HERE'S A QUESTION I NEVER
THOUGHT I'D ASK--

10:16.315 --> 10:20.420
WHAT IS OUR 14-YEAR-OLD
DOING ON THE ROOF WITH A RIFLE?

10:20.452 --> 10:23.956
SNIPERS SEEK THE HIGH GROUND.
IT EXPANDS THEIR KILL ZONE.

10:23.991 --> 10:26.126
IT'S A PELLET GUN,
NOT A RIFLE.
(door opens)

10:26.159 --> 10:28.094
(singsongy) GUESS WHO'S GOT
A DATE WITH GREG ARCHER?

10:28.128 --> 10:31.364
HEY, WOW. YOU FINALLY
REELED HIM IN, HUH?

10:31.397 --> 10:32.365
YEP.
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE BAIT.

10:32.398 --> 10:37.103
PRACTICALLY JUMPED
RIGHT INTO THE BOAT.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.038
WELL, YOU MUST BE HAPPY,
HUH?

10:39.071 --> 10:41.941
ALL YOUR COMPLAINING
ABOUT OUR DAUGHTERS' BOYFRIENDS,

10:41.974 --> 10:44.010
AND MANDY SNAGS
YOUR PERFECT GUY.

10:44.043 --> 10:45.978
AH, MIGHT NOT BE "PERFECT."

10:46.012 --> 10:47.180
OH, ALL RIGHT. HERE WE GO.
HERE IT IS.

10:47.214 --> 10:48.281
ALL RIGHT, COME ON. COME ON,

10:48.315 --> 10:50.049
I KNEW THERE'D BE SOMETHING.
GO AHEAD.

10:50.082 --> 10:51.951
I'M JUST... (lowered voice)
I'M JUST SAYING

10:51.984 --> 10:54.053
HE MIGHT NOT BE
WHAT HE SEEMS TO BE.

10:54.086 --> 10:57.357
HONEY, HE SEEMS TO BE
A SPORTS HERO BOUND FOR COLLEGE.

10:57.389 --> 11:00.360
WHAT HORRIBLE CRIME
DID HE COMMIT?

11:00.392 --> 11:02.962
HE TALKS ABOUT HIMSELF
IN THE THIRD PERSON.

11:02.996 --> 11:03.963
OH.

11:03.997 --> 11:06.233
SON OF A BITCH.

11:08.267 --> 11:10.369
EVERY TIME I LOOKED FOR HIM
TODAY, HE WAS MISSING.

11:10.403 --> 11:13.006
HE DUMPED ALL HIS WORKLOAD
ON KYLE.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.206
HE'S DONE THE IMPOSSIBLE.

11:14.241 --> 11:18.245
HE'S ACTUALLY MADE KYLE
LOOK LIKE AN OVERACHIEVER.

11:18.278 --> 11:20.247
I BET HE ISN'T AS BAD
AS YOU SAY HE IS.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.014
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT PICKING GUYS?

11:22.049 --> 11:26.318
JUST 'CAUSE YOU NAILED IT
PERFECTLY 25 YEARS AGO.

11:26.353 --> 11:30.057
YOU KNOW WHAT, HONEY?
YOU JUST HAVE TO ACCEPT

11:30.089 --> 11:32.059
THAT YOUR DAUGHTERS
ARE GONNA LIKE BOYS

11:32.091 --> 11:33.926
WHETHER YOU LIKE THEM
OR NOT.

11:33.961 --> 11:35.228
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
THEY JOIN A CONVENT,

11:35.262 --> 11:38.164
AND THEN THEY CAN BE
MARRIED TO JESUS.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.099
WOULD YOU BE OKAY WITH HIM?

11:40.132 --> 11:44.103
I'D STILL WANNA MEET
HIS FATHER.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.277
(door closes)
MIKE, LOOK AT THIS--

11:50.310 --> 11:53.012
INCREASED FOOT TRAFFIC
SINCE WE HIRED GREG.

11:53.045 --> 11:54.214
I'M LIKING THIS KID.

11:54.247 --> 11:57.217
YOU'RE NOT PATTIN' HIM
ON THE BUTT, ARE YOU?

11:57.250 --> 11:59.952
YOU REALLY GOTTA
BREAK THAT CYCLE.

11:59.987 --> 12:00.720
I'M JUST SAYING
YOU WERE RIGHT.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.923
EVERYBODY WANTS
A GLIMPSE OF HIM.

12:02.956 --> 12:04.057
I'D LIKE
A GLIMPSE OF HIM, TOO--

12:04.091 --> 12:05.926
ACTUALLY DOING HIS JOB.

12:05.958 --> 12:07.928
OH, SO NOW YOU'RE DOWNING
YOUR QUARTERBACK, HUH?

12:07.960 --> 12:10.930
EVEN THOUGH HE AND MANDY
HAVE A DATE TONIGHT?

12:10.964 --> 12:12.398
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

12:12.431 --> 12:15.969
OH, MANDY AND I
ARE FACEBOOK PALS.

12:16.002 --> 12:20.974
I ASKED HER TO BE MY FRIEND.
SHE SAID YES.

12:21.007 --> 12:23.209
WE CALL IT "FRIENDING."

12:23.243 --> 12:26.980
YOU SHOULD CALL IT
FRIGHTENING.
OH.

12:27.013 --> 12:29.949
MANDY HAS THOUSANDS OF FRIENDS
ON THE WORLD WIDE WEB.

12:29.983 --> 12:31.217
AS A PARENT,
YOU'RE ALWAYS FRIGHTENED

12:31.251 --> 12:35.255
THAT ONE OF HIM'S
GONNA BE A WEIRD OLD MAN.
(sighs)

12:35.288 --> 12:37.390
YOU KNOW, MAYBE I'M BEING
HARD ON THIS KID

12:37.424 --> 12:39.392
JUST BECAUSE MANDY
LIKES HIM.

12:39.426 --> 12:42.295
BUT IF HE'S NOT DOING HIS JOB,
WE NEED TO STRAIGHTEN HIM OUT.

12:42.329 --> 12:44.932
ALL RIGHT. WE JUST GOTTA
KICK HIS ASS A LITTLE BIT.

12:44.965 --> 12:47.233
EVERYBODY GIVES THESE ATHLETES
A LOT OF SLACK.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.969
DOESN'T DO THEM ANY GOOD.

12:49.001 --> 12:53.072
I MEAN, 99% OF THESE KIDS
WILL NEVER PLAY FOR A PRO TEAM,

12:53.105 --> 12:55.207
OR EVEN THE CLEVELAND BROWNS.

12:57.009 --> 12:58.946
(Ed) DON'T KNOCK THE BROWNS,
MIKE.

12:58.979 --> 13:00.780
IF IT WEREN'T FOR THEM,
THE BENGALS FANS

13:00.780 --> 13:04.017
WOULDN'T HAVE ANYONE
TO MAKE FUN OF.

13:04.050 --> 13:05.285
I'M JUST SAYING
A KID LIKE THIS,

13:05.318 --> 13:07.154
IF HE DOESN'T MAKE IT
INTO THE PROS,

13:07.187 --> 13:08.988
HE'S GONNA LACK THE ONE THING
THAT COULD HELP HIS LIFE OUT--

13:09.022 --> 13:10.990
IS A WORK ETHIC.
ALL RIGHT.

13:11.024 --> 13:13.360
KYLE, SHOULDN'T THE QUARTERBACK
BE HELPING YOU WITH THAT?

13:13.392 --> 13:16.196
OR ANYONE.
ANY HELP WOULD BE GREAT.

13:16.228 --> 13:18.298
COME ON.
THAT'S A 2-MAN JOB THERE.

13:18.331 --> 13:20.132
I COULDN'T AGREE MORE.

13:20.167 --> 13:23.002
THERE HE IS.
ATTENDING A CUSTOMER.

13:23.036 --> 13:24.136
YEAH, NO COINCIDENCE
THAT HER RACK

13:24.171 --> 13:27.975
IS BIGGER THAN
THAT 14-POINT ELK OVER THERE.

13:28.007 --> 13:30.978
HEY, GREG! GOT A MINUTE?

13:31.010 --> 13:32.980
GUESS I'LL SEE YOU AROUND,
MISS JENSEN.

13:33.013 --> 13:36.984
THE LIBRARY HASN'T
BEEN THE SAME WITHOUT YOU.

13:37.017 --> 13:37.985
ANY TIME NOW, GREG.

13:38.018 --> 13:39.218
I WAS JUST CHECKING TO SEE

13:39.251 --> 13:41.187
IF SHE HAD MORE THAN TWO ITEMS
IN THE DRESSING ROOM.

13:41.220 --> 13:43.189
I THINK WE ALL KNOW WHAT
TWO ITEMS YOU WERE CHECKING OUT.

13:43.222 --> 13:46.125
WHOA. WHY ARE YOU
RIDING GREG ARCHER?

13:46.158 --> 13:48.028
WHOA. BECAUSE MIKE BAXTER'S
HAD ENOUGH OF THIS.

13:48.060 --> 13:49.963
YOU'RE HITTING ON WOMEN
IN THE STORE?

13:49.997 --> 13:52.064
MEANWHILE THIS POOR SLOB'S
DOING THE WORK OF TWO GUYS.

13:52.099 --> 13:55.335
YEP, YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.
IT'S A 2-PERSON DEAL HERE.

13:55.368 --> 13:56.970
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M SAYING THIS.

13:57.004 --> 13:59.006
YOU GOTTA BE MORE LIKE KYLE
ON THE SALES FLOOR HERE.

13:59.039 --> 14:00.007
THAT GUY?

14:00.040 --> 14:00.840
THAT GUY.
IN FIVE YEARS,

14:00.840 --> 14:03.375
HE'LL STILL BE WALKIN' AROUND
WITH GRAPES IN HIS POCKET.

14:03.410 --> 14:07.114
AND GREG ARCHER
WILL BE IN THE NFL.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.251
THAT'S MY T.D. CELEBRATION.
GET IT?

14:11.283 --> 14:13.019
"ARCHER."
(chuckles)

14:13.052 --> 14:17.157
NICE SHOT. YOU HIT THE SIGN
THAT SAYS "YOU'RE FIRED."

14:17.189 --> 14:20.027
LOOK AGAIN. THE SIGN SAYS,
"GREG ARCHER QUITS."

14:20.059 --> 14:22.029
TELL MANDY I'LL SEE HER
AT 8:00.

14:24.965 --> 14:27.234
WHAT THE HELL
JUST HAPPENED HERE?

14:37.243 --> 14:38.344
(door opens)

14:38.378 --> 14:41.949
HEY, DAD. CHAMBER CLEAR.
LOCK HER UP.

14:41.982 --> 14:45.217
UH, CAN WE PLEASE NOT
THROW GUNS IN THE HOUSE?

14:45.251 --> 14:49.923
LISTEN, I WANNA TALK
ABOUT GREG ARCHER AND MANDY.

14:49.957 --> 14:51.257
YOU WANNA PUT
THE RIFLE AWAY FIRST?

14:52.392 --> 14:54.061
I GET IT.
YOU DON'T LIKE THIS GUY,

14:54.094 --> 14:56.228
BUT PLEASE,
LET'S NOT OVERREACT.

14:56.262 --> 14:59.066
WELL, IT MIGHT BE TOO LATE.
I FIRED HIM TODAY.

14:59.099 --> 15:02.069
WHAT, OUT OF A CANNON?

15:02.101 --> 15:03.936
I SAW HIM WITH A CUSTOMER,
ALL RIGHT?

15:03.971 --> 15:05.973
WAS HE SUPPOSED TO
BE WITH CUSTOMERS?

15:06.005 --> 15:07.373
FOLLOWING HER INTO
THE LADIES' DRESSING ROOM?

15:07.407 --> 15:10.109
THIS GUY'S GOT NO CHARACTER.
HE'S A REAL SKEEVY GUY.

15:10.143 --> 15:11.979
ALL RIGHT, WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
HE--HE MIGHT BE A BUM,

15:12.011 --> 15:14.982
BUT WE SHOULD LET MANDY
FIGURE THAT OUT FOR HERSELF.

15:15.014 --> 15:15.983
OR WE COULD DO
THAT OTHER THING.
(snaps fingers)

15:16.015 --> 15:17.049
WHAT DO THEY CALL THAT?

15:17.084 --> 15:19.318
WHAT--IT'S CALLED PARENTING.
OH.

15:19.351 --> 15:22.990
HONEY, MANDY IS 18 YEARS OLD.
SHE'S A SMART PERSON.

15:23.023 --> 15:24.992
NO, SHE'S NOT.
BUT--

15:26.093 --> 15:27.995
WITH BOYS AND DATING,
YEAH, SHE'S SMART--

15:28.028 --> 15:32.064
YOU KNOW SHE'S ON THE INTERNET
WITH CREEPY OLD MEN?

15:32.099 --> 15:35.334
IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ED,
YES, I KNOW.

15:35.367 --> 15:39.171
WILL YOU TELL HIM THAT I AM NOT
INTERESTED IN "FarmVille,"

15:39.206 --> 15:41.108
AND--AND I'M NOT GONNA WATCH
HIS CHICKENS

15:41.141 --> 15:43.977
WHEN HE'S OUT OF TOWN.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

15:44.011 --> 15:46.345
"FarmVille"--
SO WE'RE NOT GONNA
DO ANYTHING ABOUT THIS?

15:46.378 --> 15:49.016
HONEY, YOU GOTTA SEE THIS
FROM MANDY'S PERSPECTIVE, OKAY?

15:49.049 --> 15:51.183
THE MORE YOU TELL HER
THAT THIS GUY'S OFF-LIMITS,

15:51.218 --> 15:54.021
THE MORE APPEALING
HE'S GONNA BE TO HER.
I GET ALL--I UNDERSTAND
ALL THAT. RIGHT.

15:54.054 --> 15:55.955
I WAS ON THE FENCE ABOUT YOU
UNTIL MY FATHER SAID,

15:55.989 --> 15:59.291
"STAY AWAY FROM THAT LEFT-WING
HIPPIE, MIKE BAXTER."

15:59.325 --> 16:03.163
(chuckles) WOW.
THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

16:03.196 --> 16:06.198
YEAH, WELL, YOU'RE GONNA
DRIVE HER RIGHT INTO HIS ARMS.

16:06.233 --> 16:08.035
WELL, I'VE GOTTA
SAY SOMETHING TO HER. MANDY!

16:08.067 --> 16:09.936
(Mandy) JUST A MINUTE!
OH, HONEY...

16:09.969 --> 16:11.170
LISTEN, WE ALREADY
HAVE A CAUTIONARY TALE

16:11.204 --> 16:13.306
WANDERING AROUND HERE,
EATING GOLDFISH CRACKERS

16:13.340 --> 16:14.974
AND WATCHING CARTOONS.

16:15.007 --> 16:16.343
OH, HONEY,
WE LOVE BOYD.

16:16.376 --> 16:18.110
I'M TALKING
ABOUT BOYD'S DAD.

16:18.145 --> 16:22.215
THESE JERK BOYFRIENDS HAVE A WAY
OF JUST HANGIN' OUT AROUND HERE.

16:22.248 --> 16:23.315
WELL,
MANDY IS NOT KRISTIN, OKAY?

16:23.350 --> 16:25.018
SHE'S GONNA MAKE
HER OWN SET OF MISTAKES.

16:25.052 --> 16:26.053
AND YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'S ALWAYS SAYING

16:26.086 --> 16:27.319
WE SHOULDN'T BABY THE KIDS.

16:27.354 --> 16:30.956
TILL THEY ACTUALLY
COME HOME WITH BABIES.
WELL...

16:30.990 --> 16:32.458
MANDY IS NOT
GONNA GET PREGNANT.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.194
HOW DO YOU KNOW
SHE'S NOT GONNA GET PREGNANT?
ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:34.226 --> 16:36.029
JUST TELL ME TO STOP
WHEN YOU'VE HEARD ENOUGH.

16:36.063 --> 16:39.032
ABOUT A YEAR AGO, I TOOK MANDY
TO SEE A GYNECOLOG--

16:39.066 --> 16:40.966
STOP.
ALL RIGHT.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.003
COULD WE HAVE JUST--
COULD I JUST--
HEY, HI, HONEY.
OOH, YOU LOOK SO PRETTY.

16:44.037 --> 16:45.237
DOESN'T SHE LOOK PRETTY, MIKE?

16:45.272 --> 16:47.140
SHE LOOKS WAY TOO PRETTY
FOR THAT...

16:47.174 --> 16:48.141
MIKE?

16:48.175 --> 16:49.975
RESTAURANT
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.310
WHAT--WHAT'S THE NAME
OF IT AGAIN?

16:51.343 --> 16:53.979
UM, I'M JUST PICKING UP SOME
CHINESE FOOD AND MEETING HIM.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.914
OH.
YOU'RE PAYING FOR DINNER?

16:55.947 --> 16:57.016
CAN I GET 20 BUCKS?

16:57.050 --> 16:59.018
I'M PAYING FOR DINNER?
MIKE.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.054
(sighs)

17:02.088 --> 17:03.922
THANK YOU.

17:03.955 --> 17:05.225
BUT IF WE COULD JUST--
I JUST--
LET IT GO, HONEY. LET--

17:05.257 --> 17:08.027
IF WE--
LET IT--
HONEY, LET IT GO.

17:09.028 --> 17:11.364
THANK YOU. GOOD NIGHT.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.967
THANK YOU.

17:22.308 --> 17:27.114
(engine rumbling)

17:27.147 --> 17:29.082
(turns off engine)

17:33.952 --> 17:34.920
HEY. HEY, KYLE.
HEY.

17:34.953 --> 17:36.021
WHERE'S GREG?

17:36.055 --> 17:39.259
UM, HE'S NOT HERE.
HE QUIT TODAY.

17:39.291 --> 17:42.027
HE WAS SUPPOSED
TO MEET ME.

17:42.061 --> 17:45.198
HE DIDN'T... HE DIDN'T
TEXT ME OR ANYTHING.

17:45.232 --> 17:47.032
WHAT AN ASS.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.033
I KNOW.

17:48.067 --> 17:51.002
HE DOES A LOT OF SQUATS.

17:53.004 --> 17:56.209
BUT IT'S STILL RUDE FOR HIM
TO BLOW YOU OFF LIKE THIS.

17:56.243 --> 17:58.043
DO YOU THINK
HE'S COMING BACK?

17:58.077 --> 18:00.045
I WOULDN'T COUNT ON IT.

18:00.079 --> 18:03.382
HE SAID, "GREG ARCHER'S GOTTA
GO RENEW HIS LIBRARY CARD,

18:03.416 --> 18:05.184
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?"

18:06.986 --> 18:09.956
I DIDN'T, BUT...

18:09.989 --> 18:11.958
HE SURE MADE IT SOUND
LIKE WAY MORE FUN

18:11.991 --> 18:13.160
THAN WHEN I RENEW MINE.

18:14.961 --> 18:16.295
YOU OKAY, MANDY?

18:18.097 --> 18:19.332
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?

18:21.968 --> 18:24.337
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

18:24.370 --> 18:30.242
MANDY...
I KNOW GREG'S A BAD BOY,

18:30.277 --> 18:33.213
AND WE'VE ALREADY DISCUSSED
HIS KILLER GLUTES...

18:35.215 --> 18:37.983
BUT I DON'T THINK HE'S ANYWHERE
NEAR GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU.

18:39.017 --> 18:42.255
THANKS, KYLE.

18:42.289 --> 18:44.257
YOU'RE A REALLY GOOD GUY.

18:44.291 --> 18:45.991
YEAH, I KNOW.

18:46.024 --> 18:47.327
IT SUCKS.

18:47.359 --> 18:51.130
NO. IT'S A GOOD WAY TO BE.
IT SUITS YOU.

18:52.998 --> 18:56.001
CHECK IT OUT. GREG AND I WERE
SUPPOSED TO HAVE A PICNIC.

18:56.034 --> 18:58.103
CHINESE FOOD
AT THE 50-YARD LINE.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.340
AH, CHINA--

19:00.372 --> 19:04.010
THE DARK CONTINENT.

19:04.042 --> 19:07.013
THE LAND DOWN UNDER.

19:07.046 --> 19:08.215
THE EMERALD ISLE.

19:10.349 --> 19:15.254
WOW. YOU REALLY KNOW
A LOT ABOUT CHINA.

19:19.991 --> 19:21.961
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:21.993 --> 19:24.197
WE COULD HAVE
A PICNIC RIGHT HERE.

19:24.231 --> 19:26.966
YOU HUNGRY? WANT SOME?

19:26.998 --> 19:28.167
NO, THANKS.

19:28.201 --> 19:30.337
BROUGHT MY EGG SALAD SAND--

19:32.272 --> 19:34.973
YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:35.006 --> 19:36.243
CHINESE FOOD SOUNDS GREAT.

19:38.345 --> 19:40.380
OH, I HAVE AN IDEA--

19:40.412 --> 19:42.914
UM, AFTER WE EAT, WE SHOULD
TOTALLY TAKE THE FORKLIFT,

19:42.949 --> 19:46.918
AND, LIKE, GO AND FIND
GREG'S TRUCK AND FLIP IT.

19:46.953 --> 19:49.921
YEAH, I CAN'T DO THAT, MANDY.
AW.

19:49.956 --> 19:51.089
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
WE COULD DO?

19:51.122 --> 19:53.091
WHAT?
HIS TRUCK IS SORT OF DIRTY.

19:53.124 --> 19:56.363
UH-HUH?
WE COULD WRITE "WASH ME"
ON THE BACK WINDOW.

19:56.396 --> 19:57.929
SOMEBODY DID THAT
TO ME ONCE.

19:57.964 --> 20:00.267
MAN, WHAT A BURN.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.935
(laughs)

20:02.968 --> 20:05.972
(both speaking indistinctly)

20:07.407 --> 20:09.276
YOU HAVE TO SPLIT THEM
APART.

20:09.308 --> 20:12.011
(laughs)

20:12.044 --> 20:14.046
HAVE YOU NEVER
USED CHOPSTICKS?

20:18.951 --> 20:19.985
(chuckles)

20:22.389 --> 20:24.923
(chuckles)
WERE YOU WAITING UP
FOR ME?

20:24.957 --> 20:27.026
OH, NO, I WAS JUST
CATCHING UP ON MY READING.

20:27.058 --> 20:30.362
(door closes)
"JOKES FOR THE JOHN."

20:30.397 --> 20:32.231
JUST AS FUNNY OUT HERE.

20:34.065 --> 20:36.034
WELL, HOW WAS YOUR DATE?

20:36.067 --> 20:37.035
UM...

20:37.068 --> 20:38.938
I HAD A GOOD TIME.

20:38.970 --> 20:42.040
TRUTH IS, I WAS EXPECTING
ONE THING TONIGHT,

20:42.073 --> 20:44.209
AND... I ENDED UP
GETTING SOMETHING ELSE,

20:44.243 --> 20:48.146
AND... HE TURNED OUT TO BE
A REALLY SWEET GUY.

20:48.179 --> 20:50.950
SO YOU REALLY THINK
YOU KNOW THIS GUY, MANDY?

20:50.982 --> 20:53.386
I'M STARTING TO.

20:53.420 --> 20:55.086
I'D LIKE TO GET
TO KNOW HIM BETTER.

20:55.120 --> 20:57.055
JUST MIGHT HAVE FOUND OUT
SOME NOT-SO-NICE THINGS

20:57.088 --> 20:59.057
ABOUT THIS GREG ARCHER.

20:59.090 --> 21:01.159
I KNOW. I HAVE, TOO.

21:01.192 --> 21:03.929
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT ME, DADDY.

21:03.963 --> 21:05.131
I KNOW, BUT I WILL,
YOU KNOW?

21:05.163 --> 21:07.999
TILL I'M DEAD.

21:08.034 --> 21:10.269
COUPLE TWO, THREE DAYS
AFTERWARDS, PROBABLY.

21:10.302 --> 21:11.303
GOOD NIGHT.

21:11.338 --> 21:13.072
WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.
HMM?

21:13.105 --> 21:16.942
WHAT DID THE ONE JOHN
SAY TO THE OTHER JOHN?

21:16.975 --> 21:19.978
"WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?
YOU LOOK... YOU LOOK FLUSHED."
