HOW'D IT GO?

11:22.264 --> 11:24.141
CAN'T YOU HEAR THEM?

11:24.225 --> 11:27.061
THEY WANT AN ENCORE!

11:27.144 --> 11:28.187
THEY'RE NOT
GETTING IT FROM ME.

11:28.270 --> 11:30.689
THE SLAMMER IS RETIRED.

11:30.773 --> 11:32.066
THANKS FOR HELPING ME.

11:32.149 --> 11:34.443
YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON TV
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

There you have it, folks,
another brilliant performance

11:41.325 --> 11:44.453
by Slammin' Sammy Dullard.

11:44.537 --> 11:48.082
Who knows what surprises
he'll have for us next time?

11:48.165 --> 11:49.708

{\an1}WHERE DID YOU GET
THAT MOVE?

12:28.164 --> 12:30.166
THAT WAS SWEET!

12:30.249 --> 12:32.626
{\an1}MAN, I THOUGHT TWISTER
HAD YOU FOR SURE.

12:32.710 --> 12:34.336
YOU DID IT AGAIN, ROCKET BOY.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.922
{\an1}HELLO! YOU COULD
AT LEAST PAY ATTENTION

12:37.006 --> 12:38.340
WHILE WE'RE TRYING
TO CONGRATULATE YOU.

12:38.424 --> 12:40.551
Otto:
STREET LUGE?

12:40.634 --> 12:43.512
IF IT'S ANYTHING LIKE
THE OTHER LUGE

12:43.596 --> 12:45.681
IT'S VERY LOW TO THE GROUND
AND VERY FAST.

12:45.764 --> 12:46.682
YOU'RE JUST INCHES
AWAY FROM ROAD

12:46.765 --> 12:49.727
RUSHING BY YOU
LIKE A GIANT BELT SANDER.

12:49.810 --> 12:51.270
ONE FALSE MOVE,
AND YOU'RE HIGHWAY SPIN ART.

12:51.353 --> 12:53.355
I COULD RULE THIS SPORT.

12:53.439 --> 12:55.774
DON'T YOU WANT
TO TRY IT ONCE

12:55.858 --> 12:57.860
BEFORE YOU GO INTO
YOUR VICTORY DANCE?

12:57.943 --> 13:01.280
FOR ME, PRACTICE IS
JUST A TECHNICALITY.

13:01.363 --> 13:03.032
{\an1}DO YOU ALWAYS HAVE
TO BE THE BEST?

13:03.115 --> 13:07.703
{\an5}REG, DO YOU THINK
IT'S EASY ALWAYS
BEING THE BEST?

13:07.786 --> 13:09.455
THE FAME, THE PRESSURE.

13:09.538 --> 13:11.373
LUCKILY I'M USED TO IT.

13:11.457 --> 13:12.666
COME ON, TWISTER

13:12.750 --> 13:14.710
THE ONE-TWO PUNCH
ON THE STREET LUGE.

13:14.793 --> 13:15.711
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

13:15.794 --> 13:16.712
SIGN ME UP.

13:16.795 --> 13:18.464
{\an1}WHAT'S SO BAD
ABOUT SECOND PLACE?

13:18.547 --> 13:19.715
IT'S RIGHT AFTER FIRST

13:19.798 --> 13:21.467
AND RIGHT
BEFORE FOURTH.

CUTTING IT, OTTO MAN.

13:44.281 --> 13:45.407
(<i> Otto laughs</i> )

13:45.491 --> 13:49.453
I JUST HOPE WE HAVE SOME SKIN
LEFT FOR THE PRACTICE HEATS.

13:49.537 --> 13:51.830
OR FOR SITTING DOWN.

13:57.545 --> 13:59.922
OTTO AND TWISTER
ARE UP NEXT.

14:00.005 --> 14:01.257
BANDAGES READY.

14:06.303 --> 14:08.597
GO. GO, TWISTER!

14:08.681 --> 14:08.847
AND OTTO.

14:14.311 --> 14:15.980
HE'S REALLY FLYING.

14:16.063 --> 14:17.773
TEAR IT UP, TWIST.

14:20.609 --> 14:24.113
WHOA, YES, YES, YES, ALL RIGHT!

14:24.196 --> 14:25.447
Twister:
WHOA!

14:25.531 --> 14:26.782
FIRST PLACE!

14:26.865 --> 14:28.993
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

14:29.076 --> 14:30.369
AM I DREAMING?

14:30.452 --> 14:32.288
DON'T THINK SO!

14:32.371 --> 14:33.581
YEAH!

14:33.664 --> 14:35.749
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT EITHER.

14:40.087 --> 14:41.255
NUMBERS DON'T LIE.

14:41.338 --> 14:44.300
YOU DEFINITELY HAD
THE EDGE OVER OTTO.

14:44.383 --> 14:47.720
THERE'S A FIRST AND SECOND
TIME FOR EVERYTHING, HUH, OTTO?

14:47.803 --> 14:49.555
THIS IS JUST A PRACTICE HEAT.

14:49.638 --> 14:51.932
WHEN I GET IN THAT RACE,
I'M GOING TO WIN

14:52.016 --> 14:53.892
WITH OR WITHOUT
YOU BEHIND ME.

14:53.976 --> 14:55.352
OTTO, I CAN ALWAYS
ROOT FOR SOMEONE ELSE

14:55.436 --> 14:56.687
ONCE IN AWHILE, CAN'T I?

14:56.770 --> 15:00.899
GO AHEAD, LIKE I SAID,
IT WON'T DO ANY GOOD.

15:00.983 --> 15:02.568
HOW ABOUT
SOME APPLAUSE

15:02.651 --> 15:04.153
FOR YOUR BEST FRIEND.

15:04.236 --> 15:05.362
{\an1}WHOA-HO.

15:05.446 --> 15:06.488
THIS WAS JUST A PRACTICE HEAT.

15:06.572 --> 15:10.159
WHAT'S THE POINT, IF YOU'RE
NOT GOING TO HAVE ANY FUN?

15:10.242 --> 15:11.744
IT'S ONLY FUN IF I WIN.

15:11.827 --> 15:14.538
YOU CAN'T FINISH
FIRST ALL THE TIME.

15:14.622 --> 15:15.664
AND LOOK AT TWISTER.

HE'S SO STOFED,
FOR ONCE.

I'LL WIN NEXT TIME.

15:22.546 --> 15:25.174
TAKE THIS SHORTCUT HERE.

15:25.257 --> 15:27.343
NO ONE SEES YOU
OFF THE COURSE

15:27.426 --> 15:29.178
AND THEN YOU
REENTER HERE.

15:29.261 --> 15:30.929
DUDE, THAT'S CHEATING!

15:31.013 --> 15:35.309
DUH, IT'S ONLY CHEATING
IF YOU GET CAUGHT.

LINE, BRO...

15:39.647 --> 15:40.981

17:01.854 --> 17:05.315
ONLY IF THAT DETOUR
HE TOOK WAS A SHORTCUT.

MAKE IT UP TO HIM?

21:03.762 --> 21:04.972
DON'T LOOK AT ME.

21:05.055 --> 21:08.642
YOU HAVE TO FIGURE
THIS OUT YOURSELF.

DON'T BOTHER
ASKING TITO.
