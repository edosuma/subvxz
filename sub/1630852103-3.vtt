when they were a little.

It's very hard to tell them apart.

I've heard all the stories from their mom,

10:52.068 --> 10:54.820
and she's told me some things,
and they were awful kids.

Since you went to the baby shower,
how was it?

Was it a big party
like we expect from Christine?

fancier than most people's weddings.

Kind of like a set
from a movie or something.

she had an emergency C-section.

-She did?
-[Amanza] Yeah.

18:33.237 --> 18:38.742
And I just see my legs flying in the air,
and then he was coming out sideways,

18:38.826 --> 18:42.663
and his umbilical cord
was wrapped around him, so…

18:42.746 --> 18:44.081
Was the baby in distress?

18:44.164 --> 18:47.376
Yeah. They said his heart rate's
going down. I hear, "Emergency C-section."

18:47.459 --> 18:49.878
"Let's go, let's go!" With no epidural.

18:49.962 --> 18:52.089
Oh, my God. They did it without?

18:52.172 --> 18:54.508
Poor Christian was probably freaking out.

18:54.591 --> 18:57.219
He was absolutely freaking out.

18:57.302 --> 19:00.556
And then, when we were doing
the emergency C-section,

19:00.639 --> 19:04.768
my heart rate was going down,
the baby's heart rate was going down.

19:04.852 --> 19:05.686
Oh, my…

19:05.769 --> 19:08.063
[Christine] Then one of the nurses
went up to Christian

19:08.147 --> 19:11.817
and said, "You need to make a priority.
You have to choose one."

19:11.900 --> 19:13.235
Shut up.

19:13.318 --> 19:15.821
He was like,
"Both. You need…" Like, "Both!"

19:15.904 --> 19:16.905
Wow.

19:18.365 --> 19:19.366
[baby fusses]

19:20.242 --> 19:22.119
[voice breaks] I just reme… [scoffs]

19:23.871 --> 19:27.499
I just remember,
before I went under the anesthesia,

19:28.083 --> 19:31.211
hearing that the baby's heart rate
was going down,

19:31.295 --> 19:33.130
and they were afraid it was gonna stop.

19:33.213 --> 19:35.549
That's the last thing I heard, um…

19:37.509 --> 19:38.760
until I woke up.

19:38.844 --> 19:42.723
So it was a nightmare.
It was literally a nightmare.

19:43.432 --> 19:44.516
[sighs]

19:44.600 --> 19:46.602
-[fussing]
-[sniffles] Are you hungry?

19:47.311 --> 19:50.063
I'm just gonna go feed him quick.
I'll be right back.

19:50.147 --> 19:51.773
-Okay.
-[Christine] Are you hungry?

19:52.274 --> 19:53.275
Here. Come here.

19:53.358 --> 19:55.360
Shit. I need a drink!
That stressed me out.

19:55.444 --> 19:57.571
I'm gonna open
the bottle of champagne I brought.

19:57.654 --> 19:59.489
Did I say I wanted another baby one day?

19:59.573 --> 20:01.533
-I just changed my mind.
-Wow.

20:01.617 --> 20:06.038
We're thankful to say that all three of us
were able to come home from the hospital,

20:06.121 --> 20:09.208
and we're just counting
our blessings each and every day.

20:09.833 --> 20:10.709
[sighs]

20:10.792 --> 20:13.712
-He's sleeping now.
-I'm in shock with your story.

20:13.795 --> 20:17.007
[sighs] Yeah, it was… It was insanity.

20:17.090 --> 20:22.054
I wake up, and I just remember
someone with a needle that was this long,

20:22.554 --> 20:24.765
performing a TAP block on my abdomen.

20:24.848 --> 20:27.184
-What's that mean?
-I guess it's for the pain.

20:27.267 --> 20:30.687
-But I'm like, "What is going on?"
-You hadn't even held the baby.

20:30.771 --> 20:34.233
No, I couldn't even hold my baby.
Like, I couldn't hold him.

20:34.316 --> 20:37.069
[breath trembling]

20:37.903 --> 20:39.821
'Cause I couldn't, you know?

20:41.657 --> 20:42.783
Mmm.

20:42.866 --> 20:45.327
It's like, this is a nightmare
for any mom.

20:45.410 --> 20:46.286
Are you kidding me?

20:46.370 --> 20:47.287
[sobs]

20:47.371 --> 20:51.208
Life is so short, and you never know,
like, what tomorrow brings.

20:51.291 --> 20:53.001
And so I was just like,

20:53.085 --> 20:55.712
"I'm not going to worry
about dumb shit anymore."

20:56.421 --> 20:58.006
-I'm not.
-[Vanessa] Mmm.

20:58.090 --> 21:00.634
It just really put things
into perspective for me.

21:00.717 --> 21:03.470
-And I was thinking of you.
-Mmm.

21:03.553 --> 21:06.306
[Christine] I was thinking of you.
I was thinking of everyone, you know?

21:06.390 --> 21:08.892
Well, not everyone. [laughs]

21:08.976 --> 21:11.979
Maybe there's a few girls
I wasn't thinking of. [laughs]

21:12.562 --> 21:16.108
[Vanessa] I admire you and respect you.
Whatever you need from me.

21:16.191 --> 21:17.818
[Christine] You are so sweet.

21:17.901 --> 21:23.865
[Amanza] I'm so glad
that everything worked out the way it did.

21:23.949 --> 21:26.285
-Do you wanna have babies?
-I do!

21:26.368 --> 21:27.536
It hasn't happened.

21:27.619 --> 21:32.124
I think I had the opportunity to be a mom,
but it wasn't the right person.

21:32.207 --> 21:33.750
I got married very young.

21:33.834 --> 21:37.004
He was my second boyfriend,
and we were together for almost a decade,

21:37.087 --> 21:38.422
and it didn't work,

21:38.505 --> 21:40.716
but I'm a firm believer in love, so…

21:41.508 --> 21:45.262
I hope it does happen,
but if it doesn't, and you have a baby,

21:45.345 --> 21:48.015
at least you know
that you have a good co-parent

21:48.098 --> 21:49.975
that is a good father.

21:50.058 --> 21:53.186
Could you imagine if you had babies
with, like, people that…

21:53.270 --> 21:55.439
Sometimes I'm like, "Oh, my gosh."

21:55.522 --> 21:58.608
I had babies with somebody
that I thought would be a good dad,

21:58.692 --> 21:59.526
and that didn't…

21:59.609 --> 22:01.361
Like, you can't even really plan it.

22:01.445 --> 22:04.197
-[Christine] Have you heard anything?
-Nothing. Not…

22:04.865 --> 22:05.991
Nothing.

22:06.074 --> 22:10.746
He was a good dad for,
like, what, eight years?

22:10.829 --> 22:12.372
He was a good dad.

22:12.456 --> 22:16.293
And then literally just dropped them off
at school one day,

22:16.376 --> 22:18.962
and disappeared
from the fricking face of the Earth.

22:19.046 --> 22:21.048
-I didn't know that.
-[Amanza] Oh, yeah.

22:21.131 --> 22:24.051
People think it's,
"Wait. There's more to the story. What?"

22:24.551 --> 22:25.844
This is the story.

22:26.470 --> 22:28.096
-That is insane.
-[Amanza] It's insane.

22:28.180 --> 22:31.099
Overnight, I went from being
a part-time single mom

22:31.183 --> 22:33.477
with a dad that was there every other week

22:33.560 --> 22:35.729
to just full-time single mom

22:35.812 --> 22:38.899
with no answers
and heartbroken children, you know?

22:38.982 --> 22:40.484
It was fucking horrible.

22:41.068 --> 22:44.071
-So it's been gnarly.
-Oh, wow. I didn't know.

22:44.154 --> 22:47.824
[chuckles] I came over
to see the baby, not have a cry-fest.

22:47.908 --> 22:50.410
-Oh, I love you.
-I love you too.

22:50.494 --> 22:53.955
If someone would've told me a year ago
that Christine would be the one

22:54.039 --> 22:55.582
to console me like she is,

22:55.665 --> 22:57.209
I wouldn't have believed it.

22:58.085 --> 22:59.086
Well, look at us.

23:00.087 --> 23:01.380
All growned up.

23:01.463 --> 23:03.548
-You're an amazing mom.
-Thank you.

23:03.632 --> 23:06.385
-We love you, and we're here for you.
-[Amanza] Thank you.

23:06.468 --> 23:08.470
You're gonna be an amazing mom too.

23:08.553 --> 23:10.639
Yeah. You guys are the best.

23:29.533 --> 23:31.410
[Maya babbles]

23:31.493 --> 23:32.953
Aw!

23:33.537 --> 23:35.997
[Mary] You know what?
I've never seen your daughter.

23:36.081 --> 23:38.291
I'm never on Instagram,
so I've never seen her.

23:38.375 --> 23:40.585
-[Maya] You held her, remember?
-I held her?

23:40.669 --> 23:43.463
-Were you drunk?
-[Mary] I hope I didn't hold a baby drunk.

23:43.547 --> 23:45.549
[Maya] Mary was like,
"I never saw your daughter."

23:45.632 --> 23:47.175
-[Mary] Wait, I held her?
-[Maya] Yeah!

23:47.259 --> 23:50.095
-I was probably drunk.
-I guess you were drunk. [laughs]

23:50.178 --> 23:52.764
[Mary] I'm just gonna sit down. [chuckles]

23:53.849 --> 23:55.392
Can I get you guys's opinion?

23:55.475 --> 23:59.563
'Cause I'm seriously contemplating
putting in an offer on this house.

23:59.646 --> 24:01.064
[Vanessa] Oh, wow!

24:01.148 --> 24:02.524
It has a pool!

24:02.607 --> 24:06.027
-That is like a "wow" factor.
-[Maya] I love it.

24:06.111 --> 24:09.739
When you come in the front door,
like, that's what you would walk into.

24:09.823 --> 24:10.824
[Maya] That's awesome.

24:10.907 --> 24:13.493
[Chrishell] I always loved
the floor plans where you walk in…

24:13.577 --> 24:15.203
-[both] And it's open.
-[Chrishell] Yeah.

24:15.287 --> 24:17.747
[Maya] So what's the asking price
for that one?

24:17.831 --> 24:20.917
So this one is at three-five,

24:21.001 --> 24:24.921
which is definitely above what I'm…
I was hoping to keep it under three,

24:25.005 --> 24:27.799
but your reaction
was really, like, helping me.

24:27.883 --> 24:30.469
-I'm really, like--
-Look at the view from there.

24:30.552 --> 24:32.512
-[Chrishell] The master bedroom.
-[Maya] I love it.

24:32.596 --> 24:36.475
[Maya] Do it. You know this market.
You'll lose it if you don't be aggressive.

24:36.558 --> 24:37.726
You have to act.

24:37.809 --> 24:39.728
[Chrishell] I know.
I'm starting to get anxiety.

24:39.811 --> 24:41.771
-I really want this house.
-[Mary] Don't wait!

24:41.855 --> 24:43.482
[Maya] We'll be the pushy agent.

24:43.565 --> 24:44.774
-You gotta do it.
-Yeah.

24:44.858 --> 24:47.611
[Chrishell] I'm still recovering
from the heartbreak I had

24:47.694 --> 24:50.780
putting in an offer on the Queens house
and not getting it, so…

24:50.864 --> 24:54.576
I'm not 100% sure if I'm ready
to go through those emotions again,

24:54.659 --> 24:58.330
but, at this point,
I'm never gonna forgive myself

24:58.413 --> 25:01.666
if I don't try everything
to make sure that this house is mine.

25:01.750 --> 25:03.877
How much do you love it?
I mean, one to ten.

25:04.920 --> 25:05.795
Eleven.

25:05.879 --> 25:07.339
Okay, then we gotta get it.

25:07.422 --> 25:10.008
-Just gotta do what it takes to get it.
-Okay.

25:10.091 --> 25:14.221
Even if you feel like you overpay
by $50,000 or $60,000, it doesn't matter.

25:14.304 --> 25:15.263
Right.

25:15.347 --> 25:17.849
I've never had a buyer
call me years later and say,

25:17.933 --> 25:21.478
"I'm so upset that I paid
$50,000 more than I should have."

25:21.561 --> 25:22.562
-Yeah.
-[Mary] Yeah.

25:22.646 --> 25:23.980
I'm, like, nervous. Okay.

25:24.064 --> 25:26.107
-[Jason] It'll be all right.
-Okay, okay.

25:26.191 --> 25:27.567
I'm cool, I'm calm.

25:27.651 --> 25:29.361
-[all laugh]
-[Maya] You got this.

25:29.444 --> 25:32.364
Maybe I want the house.
It's fine. Okay, here we go.

25:32.447 --> 25:34.074
Maybe I should handle this.

25:34.157 --> 25:35.617
[Chrishell] Okay, okay, okay.

25:35.700 --> 25:38.119
[line ringing]

25:39.371 --> 25:40.205
[Ari] Hello.

25:40.288 --> 25:42.874
Hey, Ari, it's Chrishell Stause
with the Oppenheim Group.

25:42.958 --> 25:45.377
-How are you?
-[Ari] What's up? Good. What's going on?

25:45.460 --> 25:50.257
I am hoping
that we could get an offer on the table,

25:50.340 --> 25:53.760
you know, that would make you
cancel your showings.

25:53.843 --> 25:55.971
Can you give me some idea of what would…

25:56.054 --> 25:57.973
Where we could just jump into escrow?

25:58.056 --> 26:01.643
I actually am calling for myself,
not Lisa.

26:01.726 --> 26:04.020
-I would be the buyer.
-[Ari] Okay.

26:04.104 --> 26:06.982
I'm going to ask for a favor,
see what you can do for her.

26:07.065 --> 26:08.650
It's important. It's her first house.

26:08.733 --> 26:10.652
[Ari] Obviously, I know you guys,
I like you.

26:10.735 --> 26:12.070
I'd love to make something happen.

26:12.153 --> 26:15.448
It's just, we're slammed
with activity on it, so…

26:15.532 --> 26:18.451
I'd say it'd have to be something
that's really compelling.

26:18.535 --> 26:21.830
You know, these are pretty,
you know, strong sellers

26:21.913 --> 26:23.915
in the sense
that they know what they want.

26:23.999 --> 26:25.041
Okay.

26:25.125 --> 26:29.629
If I come in 3,350…
Ari, you know me, you love me.

26:29.713 --> 26:33.592
Um… [chuckles] You know,
and I would remove all contingencies.

26:33.675 --> 26:36.803
Would that be something
that you could bring to your seller,

26:36.886 --> 26:40.307
and maybe we just jump
right into it and cut out all the…

26:40.390 --> 26:43.268
[Ari] I'd say put it in writing,
and I'll take it to them,

26:43.351 --> 26:45.270
and I'll get back to you ASAP,

26:45.353 --> 26:47.063
but I'm gonna need that quick,

26:47.147 --> 26:50.275
because they're gonna be
checked offline pretty soon.

26:50.358 --> 26:53.820
We'll get it to you, Ari, in ten minutes,
but try to get us a response

26:53.903 --> 26:55.363
literally minutes later.

26:55.447 --> 26:56.990
-[Ari] Okay, pal.
-Thank you so much.

26:57.073 --> 26:59.034
-Okay. Bye.
-[Ari] Thanks, guys. See you, bye.

26:59.534 --> 27:00.869
-Go write it up.
-Okay.

27:00.952 --> 27:03.288
-[Mary] Hurry!
-Oh, my God! I'm sweating.

27:03.371 --> 27:04.205
Oh, my God!

27:05.081 --> 27:07.667
I'm literally sweating
through my dress. Okay.

27:08.168 --> 27:10.337
[suspenseful music playing]

27:10.420 --> 27:13.465
I think you give yourself
a seven-day inspection contingency,

27:13.548 --> 27:14.633
and waive all others.

27:15.925 --> 27:17.052
Okay.

27:17.135 --> 27:20.722
Contingencies are put
into a contract to protect the buyer.

27:20.805 --> 27:24.517
As an agent, I wouldn't
necessarily recommend this to everyone,

27:24.601 --> 27:27.812
but I know the field,

27:27.896 --> 27:30.940
and so I do feel like,
you know, even though it's a risk,

27:31.024 --> 27:33.234
I think
it's a very calculated, smart risk.

27:33.818 --> 27:35.153
Okay, I'm done.

27:35.236 --> 27:37.322
I haven't hit…
I'm going to send it right now.

27:37.405 --> 27:38.406
Get it done.

27:38.907 --> 27:40.825
-Yeah, that quick!
-I just sent it.

27:40.909 --> 27:42.369
-All right.
-[Vanessa cheers]

27:42.452 --> 27:44.287
-[Maya] Fingers crossed.
-[Jason] Come on!

27:44.371 --> 27:46.623
-I just hope it's enough.
-Now the waiting game.

27:46.706 --> 27:48.291
What do we do? We can pray.

27:48.375 --> 27:52.420
We can… Is there something
we can burn, like sage or…

27:52.504 --> 27:55.090
