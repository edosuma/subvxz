[narrator] Previously on Lost:

00:03.838 --> 00:05.499
I think Michael has been compromised.

00:05.590 --> 00:08.798
This camp Michael is leading you to
is where they will set their trap.

00:08.885 --> 00:11.092
- / can go ashore undetected.
- [Jack] How?

00:11.179 --> 00:13.636
[Sayid] We will sail the boat
and scout them.

00:13.723 --> 00:16.510
This time, they will know
that we are coming.

00:16.601 --> 00:18.057
[all grunting, groaning]

00:20.354 --> 00:21.514
[banging]

00:21.606 --> 00:24.689
- Hi, Jack. I'm Juliet.
- Where are my friends?

00:26.277 --> 00:28.142
Tell me where my friends are!

00:47.882 --> 00:49.668
[piano playing]

00:56.724 --> 00:59.306
- [door opening]
- [stops playing]

01:59.078 --> 02:01.660

02:07.753 --> 02:09.084
[knock on door]

02:28.733 --> 02:32.521
[speaks Korean]

02:34.405 --> 02:36.487
My husband says it's time to leave.

02:37.908 --> 02:39.990
Jack and the others aren't coming.

02:40.077 --> 02:43.319
It's been over a day
since we lit the fire.

02:43.414 --> 02:46.406
- They should be here by now.
- Jack knows we're out here.

02:46.500 --> 02:49.788
He's counting on our signal.

02:56.427 --> 02:58.509
Perhaps he's not able to see the smoke.

02:58.596 --> 03:01.929
If he's north of us,
the mountains would block his view.

03:02.016 --> 03:07.010
We need to sail along the coast, clear
the mountains, and start another fire.

03:07.104 --> 03:09.095
[speaks Korean]

03:10.274 --> 03:12.606
No.

03:12.693 --> 03:16.902
I told Jack I would light a fire.
I'm not abandoning him.

03:33.756 --> 03:36.498
My husband thinks
we have to do as he says,

03:36.592 --> 03:41.131
because he's the only one
who knows how to sail.

03:41.222 --> 03:42.587
But he's wrong.

03:45.643 --> 03:47.759
I can help you sail the boat.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.740
Are you feeling any better?

04:16.507 --> 04:21.376
I made the soup myself, but I won't take
it the wrong way if you don't like it.

04:54.837 --> 04:57.579
You never made soup for me.

05:01.927 --> 05:06.421
- Am I interrupting something?
- Would it really matter if you were?

05:07.850 --> 05:12.810
We have a situation. Brian radioed in.
The Iraqi found the decoy village.

05:12.897 --> 05:16.810
- Good. That's what we wanted.
- Brian followed him back to the shore.

05:16.901 --> 05:19.313
- Ben, they have a sailboat.
- How?

05:19.403 --> 05:20.563
l have no idea.

05:20.654 --> 05:24.567
So they have a boat.
Sailing in circles will keep them busy.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.649
They could find us.

05:30.915 --> 05:33.076
- Ben...
- I'm thinking.

05:35.085 --> 05:37.576
- How quickly to gather a team?
- Within the hour.

05:37.671 --> 05:40.663
Then don't waste time talking to us.

05:44.553 --> 05:47.044
Hey, Colleen.

05:47.848 --> 05:50.009
I want that boat.

06:21.632 --> 06:25.750
- Nice alarm clock.
- l've woken up to worse.

06:26.470 --> 06:28.961
You want half a fish biscuit?

06:47.783 --> 06:49.239
- What's this?
- [man] Lunch.

06:49.326 --> 06:53.160
- We need you to keep up your strength.
- Is that right?

07:01.005 --> 07:04.497
- Danny, wait.
- Hold up.

07:04.592 --> 07:06.583
They have a boat.

07:09.346 --> 07:11.507
OK. Be careful out there.

07:18.439 --> 07:19.975
What are you looking at?

07:21.025 --> 07:22.356
Huh?

08:37.017 --> 08:39.008
What's wrong?

08:42.106 --> 08:45.018
What's wrong is I'm married.

08:45.109 --> 08:47.600
Right. That.

09:34.450 --> 09:37.613
I don't wanna share you anymore.

09:39.455 --> 09:42.447
Your English is excellent now.
You can go to America.

09:45.085 --> 09:47.076
[knock on door]

09:47.463 --> 09:49.624
- Does anyone know you're...?
- No.

09:55.179 --> 09:57.340
[keycard beeping]

10:26.043 --> 10:28.034
[indistinct chatter]

10:44.144 --> 10:46.135
[Danny] All right, here's the jig.

10:46.230 --> 10:49.347
You see these rocks here?
That's where you two come in.

10:49.441 --> 10:52.979
You're gonna chop 'em loose
and you're gonna haul 'em outta here.

10:53.070 --> 10:56.733
- You expect me to work in this dress?
- It's up to you.

10:56.824 --> 10:59.657
You can take it off if you want.

11:05.624 --> 11:07.615
How dare you.

11:07.709 --> 11:10.416
Now, if you need anything,
you raise your hand.

11:10.504 --> 11:12.836
- Ten minutes for lunch...
- I got a question.

11:12.923 --> 11:14.834
- No questions.
- She asked a question.

11:14.925 --> 11:18.509
If you try to run off,
you will be shocked.

11:18.595 --> 11:22.429
- Shot? We don't even get a warning?
- Shocked. I said shocked.

11:22.516 --> 11:25.508
If you talk to each other,
touch each other,

11:25.602 --> 11:28.093
if you're slacking,
you're gonna get shocked.

11:28.188 --> 11:32.522
You do anything at all that pisses me
off, you're gonna get shocked, OK?

11:33.402 --> 11:36.394
- Let's get to work.
- Not until I see Jack.

11:42.703 --> 11:43.988
[grunts]

11:46.748 --> 11:50.240
Now, that was a quarter charge.
You got any more questions?

12:00.304 --> 12:04.172
Soon as you're able to walk,
wheelbarrow's right over there.

14:23.447 --> 14:25.779
[Sun speaking Korean]

14:38.003 --> 14:41.587
[Sun] Why should there be
a dock all the way out here?

14:43.050 --> 14:44.711
Others.

14:44.801 --> 14:46.837
The dock's decaying. lt's overgrown.

14:46.928 --> 14:49.385
It looks like it hasn't been used
in some time.

14:49.473 --> 14:51.509
Whoever built it, they're not here now.

14:51.600 --> 14:52.715
[speaks Korean]

14:52.809 --> 14:56.643
Let's bring the boat in, tie it to
the dock and build a fire on the beach.

14:56.730 --> 14:59.187
The visibility's excellent,

14:59.274 --> 15:02.937
and Jack will be able to see us
from miles around.

15:07.449 --> 15:11.818
- Safe?
- Yes, Jin. Of course it's safe.

15:16.583 --> 15:19.074
- [grunting]
- [indistinct chatter]

15:37.187 --> 15:40.020
Hey! Get back to work.

15:43.318 --> 15:47.903
[exhaling heavily]
Whatever you say, boss.

16:00.168 --> 16:02.159
[woman] Psst.

16:04.714 --> 16:05.999
Hey.

16:07.634 --> 16:10.421
Careful. Don't let them see you
talking to me.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.799
Are they keeping you in the cages?

16:17.894 --> 16:22.638
Did you see another guy in there
with you, about my age, named Karl?

16:22.732 --> 16:25.519
No. It's just Sawyer and me.

16:26.778 --> 16:30.817
You're not even supposed
to be in that cage.

16:30.907 --> 16:33.614
What are you talking about?
Who are you?

16:36.746 --> 16:39.408
Where'd you get that dress?

16:40.709 --> 16:43.371
- They gave it to me.
- lt's mine.

16:44.921 --> 16:49.039
You can keep it.
Looks better on you anyway.

16:49.759 --> 16:51.966
Wait.

16:54.097 --> 16:56.088
Having fun yet, Freckles?

16:56.183 --> 16:58.014
Quit staring at my ass.

16:59.519 --> 17:02.135
Give me something else to stare at.

17:02.230 --> 17:03.731
[man] Hey!

17:05.275 --> 17:07.266
Shut up.

17:08.778 --> 17:11.520
Yes, sir, boss.

17:20.040 --> 17:22.031
Thank you.

17:23.835 --> 17:26.212
- What else can I do?
- Help your husband.

17:26.296 --> 17:29.129
We need as much wood as we can find.

17:30.300 --> 17:32.882
We're building quite a large fire.

17:32.969 --> 17:36.507
We have to make sure
Jack will see the smoke.

17:40.685 --> 17:44.678
Why are you lying to me, Sayid?

17:44.773 --> 17:47.264
And what would you know
about lying, Sun?

17:52.822 --> 17:56.565
You're putting our lives in danger.

17:59.496 --> 18:03.080
I'm fairly certain
our friends have been captured.

18:03.166 --> 18:06.750
There are tracks all over the dock.

18:06.836 --> 18:11.421
- They're fresh, as recent as yesterday.
- You said this clock was abandoned.

18:11.508 --> 18:14.466
That would be part of the lying
you mentioned.

18:18.181 --> 18:21.093
You're not building this fire
for our people.

18:21.184 --> 18:23.971
You're building it for The Others.

18:24.062 --> 18:26.474
I suspect that when they see the smoke,

18:26.564 --> 18:28.941
they'll send a scout party
to investigate.

18:29.025 --> 18:33.109
By then, it will be night.
When they arrive, l'll ambush them.

18:33.196 --> 18:36.063
I'll take two of them hostage
and I'll kill the rest.

18:36.157 --> 18:37.613
Two?

18:37.701 --> 18:40.113
One to make the other cooperate.

18:47.794 --> 18:53.460
- What do you need me to do?
- Lie to Jin for another 20 minutes.

18:58.054 --> 18:59.134
VVhy?

18:59.222 --> 19:02.806
Because once the fire is lit,
it will be too late to go back.

19:14.529 --> 19:16.065
[door opening]

21:52.854 --> 21:54.390
Gun.

21:56.858 --> 21:59.144

- [speaks Korean]

22:04.866 --> 22:08.108
[speaking Korean]

22:13.750 --> 22:16.617
- What is it?
- He knows what we're doing.

22:17.504 --> 22:19.495
He knows it's a trap.

22:29.098 --> 22:33.011
He says he understands English
better than I think he does.

22:38.942 --> 22:42.605
He knows I betrayed him.

22:42.695 --> 22:44.686
Gun.

22:46.866 --> 22:50.484
Can you handle one of these?
It's an automa...

23:06.135 --> 23:09.377
I think you'll be safer on the boat.

23:16.312 --> 23:21.898
Sun, if by chance they get past us,
there's another gun.

23:21.985 --> 23:24.567
lt's inside the blue tarp
beneath the galley counter.

23:24.654 --> 23:27.487
If they get past you,

23:27.574 --> 23:30.111
that means my husband is dead,

23:31.619 --> 23:33.325
and I won't care anymore.

23:35.331 --> 23:38.949
As I said, the gun is inside the tarp.

24:26.674 --> 24:28.960
[Kate grunting]

24:50.073 --> 24:52.359
Hey! Hey! Hey!

24:57.372 --> 24:59.203
[groans]

25:10.385 --> 25:12.546
- Back off!
- [Juliet] James!

25:15.306 --> 25:17.592
Put the gun down right now.

25:22.105 --> 25:25.142
Put the gun down.

- [gun cocking]
- [gaSping]

30:07.098 --> 30:09.840
I want you to let me off this boat.

30:10.977 --> 30:13.263
I can't do that.

30:14.063 --> 30:17.146
- Why not?
- It's not my decision to make.

30:17.233 --> 30:19.224
[boat creaking]

30:19.986 --> 30:23.399
- There are five of my friends up there.
- Lower your voice.

30:24.740 --> 30:25.991
OK.

30:28.869 --> 30:32.327
- Stop. l'll shoot.
- No, you won't, Sun.

30:34.959 --> 30:39.953
I know you, Sun-Hwa Kwon,
and I know you're not a killer.

30:40.923 --> 30:45.587
Despite what you may think,
I am not the enemy.

30:45.678 --> 30:48.886
We are not the enemy.

30:48.973 --> 30:54.468
But if you shoot me,
that's exactly what we'll become.

30:56.105 --> 30:58.596
Stop. lwill. l'll shoot you.

And please communicate
to your husband,

34:42.122 --> 34:44.534
the next time I will listen to him.

34:46.335 --> 34:50.248
We should go.
We have a long walk ahead of us.

- You OK?
- Never better.

35:32.673 --> 35:37.417
- What the hell were you thinking?
- I couldn't help myself.

35:37.511 --> 35:42.301
You just looked so damn cute
swinging that pickax.

35:42.391 --> 35:45.724
- The chain gang looks good on you.
- Sawyer...

35:56.322 --> 35:58.483
Two guards got some real fight in 'em.

35:58.574 --> 36:01.407
The rest of 'em
I ain't that much worried about.

36:01.493 --> 36:05.031
That heavy-set guy
packs a hell of a punch.

36:06.081 --> 36:08.993
Shaggy-haired kid's got
some martial arts training,

36:09.084 --> 36:10.915
but I could take him if I had to.

36:11.003 --> 36:14.996
And FYI, those zapper things
got a safety on 'em.

36:16.592 --> 36:20.881
Did you see the look on their faces
when you got ahold of that rifle?

36:22.348 --> 36:24.339
[chuckles]

36:27.478 --> 36:31.141
I'm guessing most of these boys
never seen any real action.

36:31.231 --> 36:34.894
But that blonde
who had a gun pointed at you,

36:34.985 --> 36:37.442
she would have shot you, no problem.

36:39.573 --> 36:42.064
Why'd she call you James?

36:44.078 --> 36:46.069
[sighing deeply]

36:46.789 --> 36:49.280
Because that's my name.

36:51.001 --> 36:52.957
I noticed something else, too.

36:54.546 --> 36:57.663
You taste like strawberries.

36:59.843 --> 37:02.926
You taste like fish biscuits.

37:11.313 --> 37:13.725
So what do we do now?

37:13.816 --> 37:15.977
Well, Shortcake,

37:16.985 --> 37:19.897
now we wait for these bastards
to make a mistake.

37:21.532 --> 37:24.740
Sooner or later,
they're gonna let their guard down.

37:24.827 --> 37:29.821
And when they do, we’re gonna be there
to put ’em in their place.

37:34.670 --> 37:36.752
[footsteps approaching]

37:42.010 --> 37:44.171
Hello, Jack.

38:00.195 --> 38:02.652
You know what's crazy, Jack?

38:02.739 --> 38:06.982
A week ago, you and l were
in exactly the opposite situation.

38:07.077 --> 38:11.070
l was the one locked up, and you were
the one coming in for visits.

38:15.711 --> 38:19.249
And I know that you were angry

38:19.339 --> 38:23.173
that I lied to you
about who I was, but...

38:23.260 --> 38:26.047
hell, do you blame me?

38:27.389 --> 38:30.756
I mean, let's face it, if I'd have
told you l was one of those people

38:30.851 --> 38:33.968
you and your friends
have been calling Others all this time,

38:35.898 --> 38:38.685
it would've been
right back to Sayid and his...

38:39.401 --> 38:41.016
...fists.

38:42.571 --> 38:43.686
Wouldn't it?

38:45.073 --> 38:47.564
What do you want from me?

38:50.913 --> 38:54.701
I want for you to change your...
perspective.

38:56.460 --> 38:59.998
And the first step in doing that
would be for me to be decent enough

39:00.088 --> 39:03.046
to introduce myself honestly, so...

39:10.933 --> 39:12.924
Hi.

39:15.062 --> 39:17.678
My name is Benjamin Linus,

39:17.773 --> 39:20.264
and I've lived on this island
all my life.

39:31.119 --> 39:33.610
You're not gonna shake?

39:44.258 --> 39:47.421
Bring it in, please.

39:49.763 --> 39:53.381
- Where are Kate and Sawyer?
- They're fine and they're close.

39:53.475 --> 39:55.682
That's all I'm able
to tell you right now.

39:55.769 --> 39:59.261
- You can tell me anything you want.
- Fair enough.

40:01.149 --> 40:04.516
It's all I want to tell you.

40:05.279 --> 40:08.612
I'm gonna make this really simple, Jack.

40:08.699 --> 40:11.736
If you cooperate, we send you home.

40:14.621 --> 40:16.657
- With what?
- When the time is right...

40:16.748 --> 40:21.708
- You tell me now.
- Patience, Jack. Patience.

40:21.795 --> 40:25.913
Home. Is that where you sent
Wait and Michael?

40:26.758 --> 40:28.669
Yes.

40:33.849 --> 40:37.012
If you could leave this island,
why would you still be here?

40:37.102 --> 40:39.093
Yes, Jack. Why would we be here?

40:41.732 --> 40:45.691
You're lying. You're stuck here
just like we are. You don't have any...

40:45.777 --> 40:48.644
Your flight crashed
on September 22nd, 2004.

40:49.531 --> 40:53.069
Today is November 29th.
You've been on our island for 69 days.

40:53.160 --> 40:56.152
And, yes, we do have contact
with the outside world, Jack.

40:56.246 --> 40:58.453
That's how we know
that during those 69 days

40:58.540 --> 41:01.953
your fellow Americans
reelected George W. Bush,

41:02.044 --> 41:05.332
Christopher Reeve has passed away,

41:05.422 --> 41:07.413
Boston Red Sox won the World Series.

41:13.722 --> 41:17.590
- What?
- If you wanted me to believe this,

41:17.684 --> 41:20.767
you should've picked somebody else
besides the Red Sox.

41:20.854 --> 41:24.597
They were down three games to none
against the Yankees.

41:24.691 --> 41:29.526
- Then they won eight straight.
- Sure. Sure. Of course they did.

41:34.576 --> 41:39.991
[crowd cheering]

41:40.082 --> 41:44.496
[man] Back to Foulke.
Red Sox fans have longed to hear it.

41:44.586 --> 41:47.919
The Boston Red Sox
are world champions.

41:50.592 --> 41:53.629
A clean sweep
of the St. Louis Cardinals,

41:53.720 --> 41:58.714
and the Red Sox celebrate in the middle
of the diamond here at Busch Stadium.

42:01.728 --> 42:03.935
- [television turns off]
- [sighs]

42:04.523 --> 42:09.358
That's home, Jack, right there
on the other side of that glass.

42:10.278 --> 42:13.441
And if you listen to me,
if you trust me,

42:13.532 --> 42:16.114
if you do what I tell you
when the time comes,

42:16.201 --> 42:17.987
I'll take you there.

42:18.620 --> 42:20.281
I will take you home.
