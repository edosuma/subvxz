I thought the same thing,
but apparently

the sign's been up for
a few months.

00:31.265 --> 00:33.866
I wouldn't count on it.
What happened?

00:33.868 --> 00:36.335
So Tori Duncan found the body
of Mary Conrad,

00:36.337 --> 00:38.604
her 72-year-old aunt, when
she dropped by to pick her up

00:38.606 --> 00:41.140
for a doctor's appointment.
Huh. Well,

00:41.142 --> 00:43.142
her aunt still has
a doctor's appointment,

00:43.144 --> 00:46.111
though I think we all know
the diagnosis.

00:46.113 --> 00:51.550
Now tell me, why is this
a major crime?

-Nolan: Conrad.

01:15.709 --> 01:18.577
Right. Mary Conrad.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.079
Sykes: The front door
was obviously forced.

01:20.081 --> 01:23.315
And personnel says Mary
retired D1 from Fraud.

01:23.317 --> 01:26.151
Joined the Academy in 1973.

01:26.153 --> 01:28.153
1973?

01:28.155 --> 01:30.589
1973 is the year I joined.

01:30.591 --> 01:32.691
She must have been
a classmate.

01:32.693 --> 01:35.027
Oh, and she retired
23 years ago.

01:35.029 --> 01:37.463
Well, you can lose the tone,
Buzz.

01:37.465 --> 01:40.766
Why don't I remember her?

01:40.768 --> 01:44.136
And this is all the rollout
we do for a former cop?

01:44.138 --> 01:45.871
I mean, where's the media?

01:45.873 --> 01:48.040
Well, this was probably just
a follow-home, sir.

01:48.042 --> 01:51.710
There's, uh, no cash
in her wallet,

01:51.712 --> 01:53.312
a bunch of drawers were
pulled open.

01:53.314 --> 01:56.682
She's the perfect target --
older, feeble, lives alone.

01:56.684 --> 01:58.484
It's a sad way
for a cop to go.

01:58.486 --> 02:00.619
Is there any sign
of a murder weapon?

02:00.621 --> 02:04.256
Uh, we found this, sir,
near the body.

02:04.258 --> 02:07.960
Someone wiped off the sides,
sir, so blood, but no prints.

02:07.962 --> 02:10.496
She was killed
with her old badge?

02:10.498 --> 02:13.165
I assume she kept it displayed
on top of the credenza

02:13.167 --> 02:15.901
by the door.
Kendall. Kendall, time of death.

02:15.903 --> 02:18.637
Uh, 9 to 11 p.m. last night.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.339
She took three or four hits
to the head,

02:20.341 --> 02:22.241
but just one blow
would've done it.

02:22.243 --> 02:24.776
Provenza: Well...
these are uncertain times.

02:24.778 --> 02:30.649
Sykes, I want you to, uh,
call the number on this receipt

02:30.651 --> 02:32.818
and see if anyone
in the grocery store

02:32.820 --> 02:34.586
remembers Mary Conrad.

02:34.588 --> 02:38.223
Or if anyone noticed someone
following her home last night.

02:38.225 --> 02:41.126
Sir, I'm not sure
a follow-home makes sense.

02:41.128 --> 02:43.362
Oh?
There's no damage
to the deadbolt.

02:43.364 --> 02:45.764
Sanchez: Well, it probably means
that she heard a knock, Buzz,

02:45.766 --> 02:47.366
and then went to the door

02:47.368 --> 02:49.468
and opened it with the security
chain still on it

02:49.470 --> 02:51.436
to see who was outside.
The door was smashed in,

02:51.438 --> 02:53.772
which makes perfect sense
with a follow-home.

02:53.774 --> 02:56.775
Yes, except why come all the way
back to the door

02:56.777 --> 02:59.444
with the groceries in her hand
and not set them over there --

02:59.446 --> 03:02.314
Is that your big issue,
the location of the groceries?

03:02.316 --> 03:04.283
Sorry, Columbo.

03:04.285 --> 03:08.620
Mary was obviously turned around
still holding the bag.

03:08.622 --> 03:11.156
Don't make theories
out of spilt milk.

03:11.158 --> 03:12.824
Buzz has a point, though,
Lieutenant.

03:12.826 --> 03:14.259
Killing Mary with the badge

03:14.261 --> 03:16.195
seems more personal
than opportunistic.

03:16.197 --> 03:17.896
Sanchez: Well, maybe it was
a follow-home

03:17.898 --> 03:19.932
until they saw the badge

03:19.934 --> 03:21.466
and then they realized
that she was a cop.

03:21.468 --> 03:23.869
I'm telling you, Julio,
she looks so familiar.

03:23.871 --> 03:26.505
And -- and Sykes said that
she worked Fraud?

03:26.507 --> 03:28.674
-More like she was a fraud.
-What?

03:28.676 --> 03:30.642
In addition to pocketing
all the cash we found

03:30.644 --> 03:32.110
in these, uh,
children's birthday cards,

03:32.112 --> 03:35.047
Mary had a lot of mail
and packages in her closet

03:35.049 --> 03:38.317
addressed to this complex,
but not to Mary Conrad.

03:38.319 --> 03:40.886
She was "collecting"
her neighbors' mail.

03:40.888 --> 03:43.021
That explains the random
stuff in here, sir.

03:43.023 --> 03:44.523
Sykes: Well, taking things
that didn't belong to her

03:44.525 --> 03:45.891
might've been a habit.

03:45.893 --> 03:47.659
The grocery store called
the cops on Mary

03:47.661 --> 03:49.561
for shoplifting last night.
-What?

03:49.563 --> 03:51.029
At around 8 p.m.

03:51.031 --> 03:52.965
I'll get in touch
with the reporting officers.

03:52.967 --> 03:55.968
-Man: Hey, police!
-I need to get my Vitamix!

03:57.938 --> 03:59.972
Oh, hey, hey. Stay on the other
side of that tape, sir.

03:59.974 --> 04:01.873
This is a crime scene.
What are you doing?

04:01.875 --> 04:03.842
Sure, of course, but, uh,

04:03.844 --> 04:05.244
you guys find a Vitamix
in there?

04:05.246 --> 04:08.413
-Excuse me? A Vitamix?
-It's like a blender.

04:08.415 --> 04:09.915
How soon can I get that back?

04:09.917 --> 04:12.017
How soon do you want to be
a suspect for murder?

04:12.019 --> 04:14.119
Look, everything on the inside
of that apartment is evidence.

04:14.121 --> 04:16.154
Oh, come on. That Vitamix
wasn't even hers.

04:16.156 --> 04:18.090
I ordered it from Amazon,
and I think she stole it

04:18.092 --> 04:19.124
off my doorstep.

04:19.126 --> 04:20.826
And when I confronted
the old bag,

04:20.828 --> 04:22.928
she gave me this.
Oh.

04:24.298 --> 04:26.431
I remember Mary.

04:26.433 --> 04:29.501
And if I'm right, there's
somebody who knew her

04:29.503 --> 04:31.103
much better than I did.

04:31.105 --> 04:34.106
Mary took a swing at me
when I relieved her of duty.

04:34.108 --> 04:36.208
Sanchez: Why were you
investigating her, ma'am?

04:36.210 --> 04:39.077
Well, when she'd make an arrest
for fraud,

04:39.079 --> 04:41.847
Mary sometimes accepted
"thank-you gifts" from banks

04:41.849 --> 04:43.215
and retail outlets.

04:43.217 --> 04:45.250
Oh, my gosh.
That is so against the rules.

04:45.252 --> 04:48.620
Yeah, well, that didn't keep her
from trying to justify it.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.889
She even mentioned that
FBI agents

04:50.891 --> 04:54.593
get to keep a percentage
of confiscated funds.

04:54.595 --> 04:55.961
Lucky bastards.

04:55.963 --> 04:58.297
Where is she? Where is she...

04:58.299 --> 05:01.133
But, you know, Mary's main
defense was that her Captain

05:01.135 --> 05:03.869
didn't like having a woman
in his unit.

05:03.871 --> 05:05.904
Well, it was a bit of
a boys' club back then.

05:05.906 --> 05:08.507
Still is.
I'm not sure, though,

05:08.509 --> 05:10.342
how much of a committed
feminist Mary was.

05:10.344 --> 05:12.411
When I asked for her
service weapon back,

05:12.413 --> 05:13.612
she called me a bitch.

05:13.614 --> 05:15.347
Oh. Well, that's shocking.

05:15.349 --> 05:16.648
[ Sighs ]

05:16.650 --> 05:19.251
Funny that she turned out
like that.

05:19.253 --> 05:21.620
I'm sure I liked her
in the Academy.

05:21.622 --> 05:23.422
Mm.
You canned her, right?

05:23.424 --> 05:26.792
No, I offered her a demotion
and a chance to work

05:26.794 --> 05:30.329
her way back up,
but she retired instead --

05:30.331 --> 05:32.864
Hi, we were asked to come up
and debrief you

05:32.866 --> 05:34.333

Mary Conrad last night?

to review the footage

05:38.505 --> 05:40.605

just a reminder, sir.

05:47.314 --> 05:49.247
I have to leave early
the day after tomorrow

05:49.249 --> 05:51.783
to get Mark's grandmother
to appoint me

05:51.785 --> 05:55.087
his probate guardian
before the judge, sir.
Right, right, right.

05:55.089 --> 05:57.622
And then, I promised Mark that
I would take him

05:57.624 --> 06:00.359
for a round of putt-putt, sir.

candy bars, olive oil.

to press charges.

a pain in the ass.

whatever she's stealing

back to the store,
and that's it.

we did everything by the book.

07:05.125 --> 07:07.259
We were very cordial.

07:07.261 --> 07:09.161
Even offered to drive her home.

07:09.163 --> 07:11.797
You did?
Did she accept?

07:11.799 --> 07:13.298
She said she had
an Uber waiting.

07:13.300 --> 07:18.270
Oh. So maybe it wasn't
a follow-home murder.

07:18.272 --> 07:20.906
It was an Uber-home murder.

07:20.908 --> 07:23.642
Hold on. Someone killed
Mary Conrad?

07:23.644 --> 07:26.178
Yes. I'm afraid so.

07:26.180 --> 07:29.981
Did either of you notice
her driver

07:29.983 --> 07:33.752
or if anyone might have
followed her home?

07:33.754 --> 07:35.754
When she didn't call
this morning,

07:35.756 --> 07:37.389
I knew something was wrong.

07:37.391 --> 07:41.460
I was running behind,
and whenever I wasn't on time,

07:41.462 --> 07:44.362

If my wife or I were even
a minute late

07:46.934 --> 07:49.868
picking up Aunt Mary,
our phones would ring.

07:49.870 --> 07:52.737
She, uh, valued promptness.

07:52.739 --> 07:57.542
What Al wants to say is that
Aunt Mary complained a lot.

07:57.544 --> 08:00.111
And she did. She was tough.

08:00.113 --> 08:02.414
<i> And grumpy.</i>
<i> Even the last...</i>

08:02.416 --> 08:04.983
-No wonder you liked her, sir.
-Well, yes, Julio.

08:04.985 --> 08:07.619
I just can't remember why.

08:07.621 --> 08:09.421
She was really needy.

08:13.026 --> 08:15.727
But she, um, could be
really funny, too.

08:15.729 --> 08:17.662
You know, Aunt Mary had a lot
of really good stories.

08:17.664 --> 08:20.966
When I was little she used to
play a lot of games with me.

08:20.968 --> 08:23.268
I mean, she cheated, of course,
but, uh,

08:23.270 --> 08:26.605
she was always obvious
about it, so she, uh,

08:26.607 --> 08:28.373
you know, made me laugh.

08:28.375 --> 08:31.376
Mary came back from the store
last night in an Uber

08:31.378 --> 08:33.211
booked on your credit card,
is that right?

08:33.213 --> 08:35.480
Probably, yeah.
We put the app on her phone

08:35.482 --> 08:37.315
a few months ago
logged into our account.

08:37.317 --> 08:39.017
Her driving had become
really erratic.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.887
She would just leave the car
wherever she wanted.

08:41.889 --> 08:45.590
After about 30 parking tickets,
we, uh, convinced her

08:45.592 --> 08:48.360
to let other people drive
her around instead.
[ Chuckles ]

08:48.362 --> 08:50.128
She always got to ride
Uber Select, too.

08:50.130 --> 08:51.963
Which not even
I'm allowed to do.

08:51.965 --> 08:53.932
Because of her back pain, Wyatt.

08:53.934 --> 08:57.202
Aunt Mary was in pain
a lot of the time.

recently?

or threatening her?

09:05.612 --> 09:08.480
Yes. Oh, my God. Yes.
Al, remember?

09:08.482 --> 09:11.149
A few weeks back she told us
about this ex-con

09:11.151 --> 09:12.884
she had put in jail
20 years ago.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.219
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:14.221 --> 09:15.654
He just gotten out of prison,
I guess,

09:15.656 --> 09:17.556
and he was coming around,
screaming at Mary

09:17.558 --> 09:18.823
for ruining his life.

09:18.825 --> 09:20.592

And as the landlord, wouldn't
you have keys to her apartment?

-Yes!

-It was Tori's apartment.
-It was?

It was their names

Why did Tori rent the apartment?
Mary kept her pension.

She had excellent credit.

And what else is her family

Nolan: $2,500 a month for rent,
another $300 for utilities.

And the cars she booked
ran another $140 a month.

So? Aunt Mary didn't have kids.
I was her next of kin.

31:42.902 --> 31:45.202
But it had to have
caused some strain.

<i> Mi pato.</i>

39:22.094 --> 39:23.560
-Sanchez: Okay.
-Mark: Oh...

39:23.562 --> 39:25.929
Here. You check my addition.

39:25.931 --> 39:27.997
Ah. You heading out,
Lieutenant?

39:27.999 --> 39:29.566
Can I take you for a drink?

39:29.568 --> 39:31.134
Oh, uh, well,

39:31.136 --> 39:33.603
I need to go by the cleaners,
get my funeral suit.

39:33.605 --> 39:37.574
[ Chuckles ] I'm going to
Mary Conrad's service tomorrow.

39:37.576 --> 39:39.809
Maybe there'll be somebody there
who can tell me

39:39.811 --> 39:41.611
why I can't remember her.

39:41.613 --> 39:44.881
And...asshole or not,

39:44.883 --> 39:46.383
she was still a cop.

39:46.385 --> 39:47.917
Well, no matter what,
Lieutenant,

39:47.919 --> 39:49.419
I promise to go
to your funeral.

39:49.421 --> 39:52.989
[ Chuckles ] What makes you
so sure I'm going first?

39:52.991 --> 39:56.326
[ Sanchez speaking
indistinctly ]
[ Scoffs ]

39:56.328 --> 39:58.595
[ Cellphone chiming ]
...and a bogey.
What's the total at the end?

39:58.597 --> 40:00.096
[ Chiming continues ]

40:00.098 --> 40:02.065
Hey, it's my ex-wife.

40:02.067 --> 40:04.134
Oh, does she -- does she
call you often?

40:04.136 --> 40:06.970
N-n-no. No.
Hold on a second.

40:06.972 --> 40:10.140
Uh, hey, Sandra. What's up?

40:10.142 --> 40:13.843
I, uh...I don't mind.

40:13.845 --> 40:16.146
If that's what you want.

40:16.148 --> 40:19.416
Yeah, sure. Go ahead.
Send it.

40:19.418 --> 40:21.818
Okay, bye.

40:23.889 --> 40:25.455
Okay.

40:25.457 --> 40:27.924
-You're not gonna believe this.
-Hmm?

40:27.926 --> 40:31.461
Sandra just filed
paperwork with the church.

40:31.463 --> 40:33.830
Huh! After all this time,

40:33.832 --> 40:35.965
she wants to have
our marriage annulled.

40:35.967 --> 40:37.934
What? Really?

40:37.936 --> 40:40.737
Oh! Wow. Andy, wow.

40:40.739 --> 40:42.972
That's...crazy.
An annulment.

40:42.974 --> 40:44.841
Are you okay with that?

40:44.843 --> 40:47.911
Um, well, I guess I have to be.

40:47.913 --> 40:51.080
You know, the more I think
about it,

40:51.082 --> 40:54.717
I think this could all
turn out for the best.

40:54.719 --> 40:57.420
You see, Sharon,
a church wedding

40:57.422 --> 41:00.256
may not be totally
out of the question.

41:00.258 --> 41:01.624
Yes, indeed.

41:01.626 --> 41:05.028
He moves in strange
and mysterious ways

41:05.030 --> 41:07.297
his wonders to perform.

41:07.299 --> 41:11.100
And good timing never ends.
[ Chuckles ]

41:11.102 --> 41:14.204
I have almost
my whole family here.

41:14.206 --> 41:15.972
And I have an evening
free for dinner.

41:15.974 --> 41:17.941
Great. I feel like celebrating.

41:17.943 --> 41:19.509
-Hmm.
-Do you?

41:19.511 --> 41:21.344
Celebrating what?

41:21.346 --> 41:25.615
A deal. What else do we
celebrate around here? A deal.

41:27.419 --> 41:29.986
A very good deal.

41:31.256 --> 41:34.491
What number is that?
Tell me. Is that...
