Bishop.

00:11.012 --> 00:12.878
Quinn:
<i> Don't come for me again,</i>

00:12.963 --> 00:14.780
because then I'll have
to come after you.

00:14.882 --> 00:16.081
Dante:
Delilah fulton?

00:16.183 --> 00:17.749
I'm detective dante.

00:17.852 --> 00:19.101
You're worried.

00:19.220 --> 00:20.552
Bishop was her mentor.

00:20.638 --> 00:21.753
Don't you worry?

00:21.856 --> 00:25.057
I would never let anything
happen to you.

00:25.142 --> 00:27.559
Mom, it's not me
that I'm worried about.

00:27.645 --> 00:29.361
It's you.

00:31.115 --> 00:33.365
Robyn:
What is mason quinn
doing in sevastopol?

00:33.451 --> 00:34.566
And who's this guy
he's talking to?

00:34.652 --> 00:37.202
That's omar delgado.
Cuban intelligence.

00:37.288 --> 00:40.656
This path you're walking down

02:13.801 --> 02:15.584

02:15.669 --> 02:17.052
Yeah.

You okay, mom? You look...

02:19.640 --> 02:21.974
Beat.

02:22.059 --> 02:24.560
(laughs softly)
nothing I can't handle.

02:24.678 --> 02:27.879
But aunt vi's gonna have
to take you to school today.

02:27.982 --> 02:29.848
I got to take a shower
and run right back out again.

02:31.018 --> 02:32.151
Oh, um, I actually have
to tell you...

02:32.236 --> 02:34.153
Whatever it is, can it wait?

02:37.491 --> 02:39.391
Sure.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.109
See you later.

02:41.195 --> 02:42.661
Maybe.

02:44.365 --> 02:46.165
Okay, spill it.
I can hear you worrying.

02:47.501 --> 02:50.235
Mom didn't come home last night.

02:50.337 --> 02:52.070
Then she shows up
this morning looking like

02:52.173 --> 02:55.907
she's been in a bar fight,
like-like it's nothing.

02:56.010 --> 02:58.544
Well, helping people
the way your mom does

02:58.629 --> 03:00.745
isn't exactly a nine-to-five.

03:00.848 --> 03:03.081
If she were a nurse or a cop,

03:03.184 --> 03:05.684
w-we wouldn't even bat an eye.

03:06.720 --> 03:09.054
Okay, fair.

03:09.139 --> 03:10.689
But tell me you haven't
noticed that, lately,

03:10.774 --> 03:12.307
when we talk to her,
she's distracted?

03:12.393 --> 03:14.309
And if you ask her
what's going on with her,

03:14.395 --> 03:16.979
she just changes the subject?

03:18.065 --> 03:20.032
I can't say that I haven't.

03:20.117 --> 03:21.366
I just can't believe that,
after everything,

03:21.452 --> 03:24.369
she still will not talk to me.

03:24.455 --> 03:27.105
It's like she doesn't trust me.

03:27.208 --> 03:30.409
Auntie, do you think
she's hiding stuff again?

03:32.296 --> 03:33.778
Harry:
<i> The cuban embassy?</i>

03:33.881 --> 03:35.380
You broke into
the cuban embassy. Alone?

03:35.466 --> 03:37.249
Rob, why didn't you tell us?

03:37.334 --> 03:38.667
Because I knew
what you would say.

03:41.338 --> 03:42.387
Mason quinn.

03:42.473 --> 03:43.622
Taken last week in sevastopol.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.624
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
H-hold on a second.

03:45.726 --> 03:46.791
I thought we were
leaving quinn alone.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.260
How long have you
been back at this?

03:48.345 --> 03:50.195
Long enough to know
he's planning something big,

03:50.264 --> 03:52.130
here in the states.

03:52.233 --> 03:55.133
This guy in the picture
with him, omar delgado.

03:55.236 --> 03:59.104
Former cuban intelligence
turned freelance militant.

03:59.189 --> 04:02.474
And right after this meeting,
he snuck into the u.S.

04:02.576 --> 04:04.743
Robyn...
If we find delgado,
he'll lead us

04:04.828 --> 04:06.478
right back to quinn.

04:06.580 --> 04:07.913
If he's here, he's getting help.

04:07.998 --> 04:10.115
That's why you broke
into the embassy.

04:10.200 --> 04:12.868
Yes, to get delgado's
classified list of contacts.

04:12.953 --> 04:15.037
Now I need your help
tracking them down.

04:15.122 --> 04:16.255
Harry: Rob,
quinn threatened

04:16.340 --> 04:18.090
to kill you
if you went after him.

04:18.175 --> 04:20.092
All right? You know
what quinn is capable of.

04:20.177 --> 04:21.927
Which is why I'm doing this.

04:23.731 --> 04:27.266
If I operate in the shadows,
he'll never know.

04:27.351 --> 04:28.600
Because breaking
into the cuban embassy

04:28.686 --> 04:30.269
is really operating
in the shadows.

04:30.354 --> 04:31.637
(stammers)
listen, rob,

04:31.722 --> 04:34.306
I get it, okay?
I get that it's personal.

04:34.391 --> 04:35.974
What he did
to bishop.

04:36.060 --> 04:37.142
But maybe the pain
that you think is driving you

04:37.227 --> 04:38.510
is actually blinding you?

04:38.612 --> 04:40.845
Mel: Look, you said you knew
what we were gonna say.

04:40.948 --> 04:43.398
That's because you know
what you're doing is dangerous.

04:43.484 --> 04:45.284
This is what bishop
warned you about.

04:45.369 --> 04:48.287
Come on, you know
that quote about revenge.

04:48.372 --> 04:50.739
You're digging two graves.

04:57.081 --> 04:59.081
Yeah, maybe it is blinding me.

05:00.250 --> 05:02.050
Maybe I just need some sleep.

05:02.169 --> 05:03.335
Yeah.

05:03.420 --> 05:05.637
I'll call you later.
Yeah.

05:07.591 --> 05:09.057
Thanks.
Mm-hmm.

05:13.263 --> 05:14.680
You thinking
what I'm thinking?

05:14.765 --> 05:16.481
Yes, I am.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.604
(line ringing)

05:24.575 --> 05:26.158
yeah, it's mccall.

05:26.243 --> 05:28.026
We need to meet.

05:29.163 --> 05:30.495
It's about quinn.

05:30.581 --> 05:32.030
<i> (school bell rings)</i>

05:33.033 --> 05:34.416
wow.

05:34.535 --> 05:36.234
Vera, these are sick.

05:36.337 --> 05:37.836
Vera:
Thanks for helping me.

05:37.921 --> 05:39.538
I'm nervous about
the speeches, though.

05:39.623 --> 05:41.123
I'm sure you'll be great.

05:41.208 --> 05:43.041
That was convincing.

05:44.044 --> 05:46.745
Oh. Sorry, it's just...

05:46.847 --> 05:48.296
Stuff with my mom.

05:48.382 --> 05:49.748
I get it.

05:49.850 --> 05:52.684
Mine have been all over me
since I got a b- in calc.

05:52.770 --> 05:55.053
I mean, come on, it's calc.

05:55.139 --> 05:57.055
God forbid I'm not perfect.

05:58.275 --> 05:59.424
(laughter)

05:59.526 --> 06:01.276
you don't have
to be an ass, logan.

06:01.395 --> 06:03.311
Dude.
Come on, let's pass.

06:04.398 --> 06:06.365
See he's taking
the break-up well.

06:06.450 --> 06:08.734
You have no idea.

06:08.819 --> 06:10.402
I kind of feel bad for him.

06:10.487 --> 06:11.603
I still care, he's just so...

06:11.705 --> 06:12.988
Logan?

06:13.073 --> 06:14.939
Exactly.

06:15.042 --> 06:18.910
But speeches are today,
and we have to be pumped.

06:18.996 --> 06:20.779
You know what
coach gilmore says.

06:20.881 --> 06:24.750
"winning the race
means showing your face."

06:24.835 --> 06:26.618
(both laugh)

06:26.720 --> 06:28.136
what does that even mean?

06:28.255 --> 06:30.121
Who knows?

06:30.224 --> 06:32.557
Got you to forget about
your mom and smile, though.

06:32.643 --> 06:33.759
That's true.

06:33.844 --> 06:35.761
(both laugh)

06:37.898 --> 06:41.066
omar delgado is here,
in new york?

06:41.151 --> 06:42.467
You know him?

06:42.569 --> 06:44.352
Been chasing him for years.

06:44.471 --> 06:46.188
The man's an ideologue.

06:46.273 --> 06:47.606
He left cuba because he felt

06:47.691 --> 06:49.608
they'd gone soft
against the west.

06:49.693 --> 06:51.810
Well, he's been hiring himself
out to russians lately,

06:51.912 --> 06:54.312
staging operations
against european targets.

06:54.415 --> 06:56.648
So what's he doing with quinn?

06:56.750 --> 06:58.583
That's why we need to find him.
See what they're planning.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.319
From cuban intelligence.

07:01.422 --> 07:03.755
Delgado's contacts
in the u.S.

07:03.841 --> 07:06.258
If he's here, he's getting help
from old friends.

07:06.343 --> 07:08.126
But I can't cover them all.

07:08.228 --> 07:10.028
I'll scramble a response team.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.696
If he's made contact
with these names,

07:11.799 --> 07:12.998
we'll know pretty quick.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.933
Call me as soon
as you find something.

07:15.035 --> 07:16.802
And carter...

07:16.887 --> 07:20.105
Keep my name out of it.

07:20.190 --> 07:22.557
Quinn cannot see me coming.

07:25.646 --> 07:27.479
Phillip:
...Giving our school
the opportunity

07:27.581 --> 07:28.680
to serve
the community.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.348
Vera, breathe.
You're gonna be great.

07:30.451 --> 07:31.700
Phillip:
Now, you all know

07:31.819 --> 07:35.053
my family owns
donatella's pizza.

07:35.155 --> 07:37.889
Vote for me
and it's free pizza Friday.

07:37.991 --> 07:39.124
No cap.
(cheering, applause)

07:39.209 --> 07:40.492
holding you to it, phillip.

07:43.464 --> 07:44.696
Girl:
Go, vera!

07:44.798 --> 07:46.331
Hello, fellow cardinals.

07:46.416 --> 07:49.033
I'm vera franks.
I don't have free pizza,

07:49.136 --> 07:51.419
but I can promise you
that if you vote for me,

07:51.505 --> 07:53.037
(phones chiming, vibrating)
I will do everything I can

07:53.140 --> 07:56.141
can to make next year
the best year ever.

07:57.144 --> 07:58.477
Here at lindheim,

07:58.562 --> 08:00.812
I have made not only the
greatest friends of my life...

08:00.898 --> 08:02.314
Dude.

08:02.399 --> 08:05.383
...I've also had some
of the best times of my life...

08:05.486 --> 08:07.819
(phones chiming,
students whispering)

08:12.326 --> 08:13.658
tori:
Oh, my god, she's nude.

08:13.744 --> 08:15.226
(laughter)

08:15.329 --> 08:17.061
boy:
Whoa.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.563
Anybody want
to meet the twins?

08:18.665 --> 08:20.081
Girl 2:
Oh, my gosh, that's her.

08:21.418 --> 08:22.534
Logan,

08:22.619 --> 08:23.535
how could you do this?

08:23.620 --> 08:24.786
Tori:
Damn, vera.

08:24.872 --> 08:25.871
No wonder you get straight a's.

08:25.956 --> 08:27.622
They look more like b's to me.

08:28.959 --> 08:30.458
(distorted chatter, laughter)

08:39.703 --> 08:40.952
oh, my god, oh, my god.

08:41.071 --> 08:43.288
Okay, vera? Vera, breathe.
Is that really you?

08:43.407 --> 08:45.957
I sent that photo to logan.
He begged me for it.

08:46.076 --> 08:47.792
But it was supposed
to disappear.

08:47.911 --> 08:49.544
Okay.
And now the
whole school

08:49.630 --> 08:51.446
has a picture of me, naked.

08:51.548 --> 08:53.415
Okay, he-he must've
taken a screenshot.

08:53.500 --> 08:55.467
He swore he wouldn't.
How could he do this?

08:55.586 --> 08:56.618
It's revenge.

08:56.720 --> 08:57.802
He's trying to get back at you

08:57.921 --> 08:59.137
for breaking up with him.

08:59.256 --> 09:01.139
Well, it worked.

09:01.258 --> 09:02.957
Everyone's gonna see this, dee.

09:03.060 --> 09:06.294
Every college I apply to,
every job.

09:06.396 --> 09:08.597
My u.N. Internship.

09:08.682 --> 09:11.316
My dreams of being in politics.

09:12.436 --> 09:14.102
My life is over.

09:14.187 --> 09:15.270
No. No, it is not.

09:15.355 --> 09:16.638
Okay? We're not gonna
let that happen.

09:16.740 --> 09:19.107
The person who should be
paying for this is logan.

09:19.192 --> 09:20.575
This is harassment, okay?

09:20.661 --> 09:22.360
We need to go
to the administration.

09:22.446 --> 09:24.979
No, dee, if-if we do,
then my parents will find out.

09:25.082 --> 09:27.249
They're your parents, okay?
They will have your back.

09:27.334 --> 09:28.783
You don't know them.

09:28.869 --> 09:30.318
They'll only care what
their church friends think.

09:30.420 --> 09:33.321
Okay, w-well, maybe the school
will keep it confidential.

09:33.423 --> 09:34.923
Okay, they said
if anything happens,

09:35.008 --> 09:37.292
then we should go to them and
not try to handle it on our own.

09:37.377 --> 09:39.961
Come on, vera.

09:40.047 --> 09:42.130
Let's at least
go talk to them.

09:42.215 --> 09:43.598
We can't do nothing.

09:43.684 --> 09:45.833
Let's go.

09:45.936 --> 09:47.852
Come on.

09:47.971 --> 09:49.104
Girl:
Vera.

09:49.189 --> 09:50.505
We are so, so sorry.

09:50.607 --> 09:53.024
Honestly, we didn't know
you had it in you.

09:53.143 --> 09:56.027
(stifled laughter)

09:56.146 --> 09:57.195
man, I'd hit that.

09:57.314 --> 09:59.531
No, no. Okay. Ignore them.

09:59.650 --> 10:01.149
Keep your head up.

10:03.620 --> 10:05.070
It's okay. Just keep moving.

10:05.155 --> 10:06.871
All right? I got you.

10:09.710 --> 10:11.526
Hey. You're back.

10:11.628 --> 10:12.794
Just got to grab a few things.

10:12.879 --> 10:14.162
Maybe you can also
get some rest.

10:14.247 --> 10:16.698
You haven't been back
before dawn in days.

10:16.800 --> 10:19.334
Honestly, auntie,
I'm feeling it.

10:20.837 --> 10:22.170
So is dee.

10:23.757 --> 10:24.923
You know what happened
to bishop triggered her.

10:25.008 --> 10:26.975
She's worried
that she's gonna lose you,

10:27.060 --> 10:29.377
and whatever it is you're doing,
you won't talk about it.

10:29.479 --> 10:31.146
Can't talk about it.

10:31.231 --> 10:33.315
And in spite of her
keeping your secrets,

10:33.400 --> 10:35.016
she thinks that you've
stopped trusting her.

10:35.102 --> 10:36.401
(stammers)
I'm sure

10:36.520 --> 10:39.187
what you're doing is important.

10:39.272 --> 10:41.690
But robyn...

10:41.792 --> 10:44.859
Dee needs to feel
like she matters to you.

10:47.030 --> 10:48.279
Okay.

10:49.333 --> 10:51.232
You're right.

10:51.335 --> 10:54.703
It's lunchtime at school.
I-I'll give her a call, say hey.

10:54.788 --> 10:56.087
Good.

10:56.206 --> 10:57.939
Remember,

10:58.041 --> 10:59.791
we're here for you, too.

11:02.763 --> 11:04.346
(phone buzzing)

11:05.716 --> 11:07.782
(speaking indistinctly)

11:15.025 --> 11:16.090
voice mail.

11:16.193 --> 11:17.809
I'll catch up
with her tonight.

11:17.894 --> 11:18.926
Promise.

11:19.029 --> 11:20.612
(phone buzzing)

11:21.898 --> 11:24.115
it's work. I got to take this.

11:25.986 --> 11:27.535
Yeah, carter. What you got?

11:27.637 --> 11:30.038
A hit on delgado's
possible location.

11:30.123 --> 11:32.040
Texting the address now.

11:33.076 --> 11:34.909
(door opens, closes)

11:36.963 --> 11:38.747
hey. What'd they say?

11:38.832 --> 11:41.750
They said they can't do anything
unless I can prove it was logan.

11:41.835 --> 11:43.284
They would need
copies of our texts,

11:43.387 --> 11:45.303
and I'd have to
show them the photo.

11:45.422 --> 11:48.139
Wait? Seriously?
That's not right.

11:48.258 --> 11:49.891
It was humiliating.

11:49.976 --> 11:51.259
And if I want to go after him,

11:51.344 --> 11:52.727
they'd have to bring in
the police,

11:52.813 --> 11:54.796
and then my parents would know.

11:54.898 --> 11:56.564
Can't they do anything
without the police?

11:56.650 --> 11:57.982
They said they could
stop all the bullying,

11:58.101 --> 11:59.567
but I'd have to mention names.

11:59.653 --> 12:01.403
Everyone would hate me.

12:01.488 --> 12:03.104
And the school
psychologist kept asking

12:03.190 --> 12:05.240
why I sent the photo
in the first place.

12:05.325 --> 12:06.991
What am I supposed
to tell her?

12:07.110 --> 12:08.693
I felt bad for not
having sex with him,

12:08.779 --> 12:11.613
so I sent him a photo of me
so he wouldn't get mad?

12:11.698 --> 12:13.114
Okay, now, vera, look at me.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.784
This is not your fault.
It's logan's.

12:17.754 --> 12:18.920
Maybe my mom could...

12:19.022 --> 12:21.489
No. I-I don't want her knowing.

12:21.591 --> 12:23.091
And what if she decides
to tell my parents?

12:23.176 --> 12:24.492
No, dee, I can't.

12:24.594 --> 12:26.761
Okay, okay, then... I mean,
we-we need to figure out

12:26.847 --> 12:28.263
who we can talk to
that can help.

12:28.348 --> 12:30.465
Stop acting like
you can fix this.

12:30.567 --> 12:32.801
You can't. No one can.

12:32.886 --> 12:35.770
(stammers)
this is my fault.

12:35.856 --> 12:38.389
I knew it was stupid to send,

12:38.475 --> 12:40.508
and now I'm gonna pay for this
for the rest of my life.

12:40.610 --> 12:44.279
No. You weren't stupid, vera.

12:44.364 --> 12:45.814
You trusted him.

12:45.899 --> 12:48.817
Well, I was stupid
for that, too.

12:49.820 --> 12:52.854
(laughter)

12:52.956 --> 12:54.372
I got to go.

12:54.491 --> 12:57.075
No, vera. Vera.

12:59.880 --> 13:01.496
(door closes)

13:01.581 --> 13:02.831
(laughter)

13:02.916 --> 13:05.550
you proud of yourself?
Dragging vera like that?

13:05.669 --> 13:09.504
As much I would like to take
credit for that, it wasn't me.

13:09.589 --> 13:11.205
You were the only one
with that photo.

13:11.308 --> 13:14.342
Says her. Who knows
who else she texted it to?

13:14.427 --> 13:15.844
You know damn well it was you.

13:15.929 --> 13:19.213
I heard whoever sent it
used a burner, so...

13:19.316 --> 13:21.215
(scoffs)
...They have no way to prove it.

13:21.318 --> 13:23.518
Besides, I think it
made her more popular.

13:23.603 --> 13:25.103
Everyone knows who she is now.

13:25.188 --> 13:27.188
(soft laughter)

13:27.274 --> 13:28.606
you think this is a joke?

13:28.692 --> 13:31.058
It's assault
and harassment.

13:31.161 --> 13:33.828
You know, maybe even
child pornography.

13:33.914 --> 13:35.113
What you did
was a crime.

13:35.198 --> 13:37.115
And you're gonna pay for it.

13:37.200 --> 13:39.083
(school bell rings)

13:41.288 --> 13:42.537
(chuckles)

13:43.590 --> 13:44.923
robyn:
It's delgado, all right.

13:45.041 --> 13:47.074
Make sure they take him alive.

13:47.177 --> 13:48.510
Griffin:
Target confirmed.

13:48.595 --> 13:50.178
All units move.

13:50.263 --> 13:52.096
Thanks, carter.

13:52.215 --> 13:53.681
Griffin:
No, I should be thanking you.

13:53.767 --> 13:56.351
The company's been
after delgado for years.

13:56.436 --> 13:59.020
The least I can do
is give you a courtside seat.

14:02.692 --> 14:04.993
Go, go, go!
All right, let's move!

14:05.946 --> 14:07.195
(gunfire)

14:08.481 --> 14:10.198
mel:
Where is she now?

14:10.283 --> 14:11.699
Your tracker
still has her at home.

14:11.785 --> 14:13.201
Maybe rob is
leaving this alone.

14:13.286 --> 14:14.869
I don't know. Something's off.

14:14.955 --> 14:17.672
Yeah, but not her instincts.
Look, check this out.

14:17.774 --> 14:19.774
Intelligence chatter
has been linking delgado

14:19.876 --> 14:21.876
to the russian assault on
the zaporizhzhia nuclear plant.

14:21.962 --> 14:23.578
Plus, there's been whispers
that quinn's been

14:23.663 --> 14:25.213
recruiting assets
in south america.

14:25.298 --> 14:26.414
I mean, it's just rumors, but...

14:26.499 --> 14:27.782
Yeah, rumors
that could get her killed

14:27.884 --> 14:29.500
if she doesn't leave it alone.

14:30.470 --> 14:32.921
Target secured, target secured.

14:35.091 --> 14:36.624
Got your ass.

14:36.726 --> 14:38.292
Well, it doesn't mean
he'll talk.

14:38.395 --> 14:39.844
Then we'll make him.

14:39.930 --> 14:41.646
We need to know
what quinn is planning.

14:43.400 --> 14:45.433
Delilah:
Hey, detective dante?

14:47.153 --> 14:48.937
Delilah, right?

14:49.022 --> 14:51.973
What can I do
for you?

14:52.075 --> 14:54.325
Unfortunately,
your friend's right.

14:54.444 --> 14:56.160
Because she's a minor,
if we get involved,

14:56.279 --> 14:57.979
her parents would have
to be notified.

14:58.081 --> 14:59.163
Okay, but why should
she be punished

14:59.282 --> 15:01.148
for something
that someone did to her?

15:01.251 --> 15:03.284
If she files a complaint,
we will do everything we can

15:03.370 --> 15:07.839
to support her, and hold the
responsible party accountable.

15:07.958 --> 15:09.657
But what about the photo?

15:09.759 --> 15:11.492
I mean, is there
anything you can do

15:11.595 --> 15:13.160
to make people
erase it?

15:13.263 --> 15:16.464
We can't seize phones
from every kid in your school.

15:16.549 --> 15:20.635
But if the photo's been shared,
the unfortunate truth

15:20.720 --> 15:22.503
about the internet
is once it's out there,

15:22.606 --> 15:24.722
there's very little
anyone can do.

15:24.808 --> 15:27.609
What do I tell her?

15:27.694 --> 15:30.778
That no one can really help her?

15:30.864 --> 15:32.179
She's terrified.

15:32.282 --> 15:35.233
Tell her that she doesn't
have to do this alone.

15:35.318 --> 15:37.235
Coming forward isn't easy,

15:37.320 --> 15:41.406
but I know for a fact
that doing nothing is worse.

15:41.491 --> 15:43.741
Thank you for your time.

15:43.827 --> 15:46.995
Hey, there is someone else
you can try.

15:48.965 --> 15:51.716
There is a woman who specializes

15:51.835 --> 15:54.135
in difficult cases
like this.

15:54.220 --> 15:56.004
She has people
who can maybe help.

15:58.808 --> 16:00.675
She calls herself the equalizer.

16:02.512 --> 16:04.712
Thanks.

16:04.814 --> 16:07.565
I'm sure she probably has
more important things to do.

16:07.684 --> 16:09.216
You never know.

16:09.319 --> 16:10.885
Thank you.

16:11.938 --> 16:13.521
(phone buzzing)

16:15.492 --> 16:17.224
hey, vera? You okay?

16:17.327 --> 16:18.993
No.

16:19.079 --> 16:21.112
I did a reverse face search.

16:21.197 --> 16:23.998
He didn't just send it
to the school.

16:24.084 --> 16:27.618
Dee, I'm on porn sites, too.

16:27.704 --> 16:29.203
Oh, my god, vera.

16:29.289 --> 16:31.572
They have my face
on other people's bodies

16:31.675 --> 16:33.207
doing awful things.

16:33.293 --> 16:34.759
It's like...

16:36.713 --> 16:40.798
...Like I'm watching myself
getting raped over and over.

16:40.884 --> 16:43.351
What am I gonna do?

16:56.216 --> 16:59.867
This is absolutely appalling.

16:59.969 --> 17:03.638
That someone would do this
to that sweet girl?

17:06.059 --> 17:09.010
Never understand how
people can be so cruel.

17:09.095 --> 17:11.879
Right? This could affect
the rest of her life.

17:11.981 --> 17:16.100
And I tried handling it
on my own, but...

17:16.186 --> 17:18.653
Mom, I hate asking.

17:18.738 --> 17:19.854
I-I didn't want to ask,

17:19.939 --> 17:22.190
but... I know that

17:22.275 --> 17:24.192
whatever you're dealing with
is, like, way more important

17:24.277 --> 17:27.412
than high
school drama...
Dee.

17:27.530 --> 17:29.831
I<i> am</i> involved in something
very important right now...

17:32.619 --> 17:34.869
...But nothing is more
important than you.

17:34.954 --> 17:37.455
I can
absolutely help.

17:37.540 --> 17:40.258
And I'm glad you came to me.

17:44.714 --> 17:46.013
Thank you.

17:46.099 --> 17:48.349
Wait, so how are
you gonna do it?

17:48.435 --> 17:50.601
I mean, are you, are you
taking it to your team or...?

17:50.720 --> 17:52.353
It's better you don't
know the details.

17:52.439 --> 17:54.305
Mom, vera's my best friend.

17:54.390 --> 17:55.723
Okay? No one is going to care

17:55.809 --> 17:57.024
as much as I do.

17:57.110 --> 17:58.226
Whatever
you're doing,

17:58.311 --> 18:00.695
I need to be a part of it.

18:00.780 --> 18:03.397
Think about it, dee.
After all you've been through,

18:03.483 --> 18:05.733
you sure you want
to pull back this curtain?

18:05.819 --> 18:07.401
Robyn:
Yeah, she's right.

18:07.487 --> 18:10.321
The more you know, the more
secrets you'll have to keep.

18:10.406 --> 18:15.076
If that's the cost
of helping vera, then...

18:15.161 --> 18:18.112
I mean, mom, haven't I proved
that you can trust me?

18:18.214 --> 18:22.083
Please, don't shut me out.

18:33.513 --> 18:37.064
Delilah, I want you to meet
two of the best people I know.

18:37.150 --> 18:39.016
Harry.
Hi, kiddo.

18:39.102 --> 18:40.685
It's good
to meet you.

18:40.770 --> 18:42.320
Sorry it's not under
better circumstances.

18:42.438 --> 18:43.905
And this is...

18:43.990 --> 18:45.656
Aww, come here.

18:45.775 --> 18:46.691
...Mel.

18:46.776 --> 18:48.860
Mel:
Sorry, I just...

18:48.945 --> 18:50.361
Couldn't help myself.
Look at you.

18:50.446 --> 18:53.164
(laughs)
um, hi.

18:53.283 --> 18:54.699
Have we all met before?

18:54.784 --> 18:56.617
No, uh, not in person.

18:56.703 --> 18:59.453
They've known you all your life.
But not in a creepy way.

18:59.539 --> 19:01.155
Actually, if I were her,
I'd be a little creeped out.

19:01.257 --> 19:02.623
Mel:
Aww.

19:05.261 --> 19:06.627
It's unbelievable.

19:06.713 --> 19:08.329
I-I mean, why is
the burden of proof

19:08.431 --> 19:09.547
always on the victim?

19:09.632 --> 19:11.632
It's obvious.
Vera dumped logan,

19:11.718 --> 19:12.833
and he revenge-porned her.

19:12.936 --> 19:14.835
It's a modern classic.

19:14.938 --> 19:16.103
Because we don't teach our boys
how to express themselves

19:16.189 --> 19:18.055
the right way.
Mel:
Mm-hmm.

19:18.141 --> 19:19.840
And they're often rewarded
instead of being punished.

19:19.943 --> 19:22.226
Meanwhile, girls
are told by the world

19:22.312 --> 19:24.011
that it's their fault,
and the more they keep

19:24.113 --> 19:26.113
hearing from people,
the more they believe it.

19:26.199 --> 19:29.617
That is exactly what vera's
doing, she's blaming herself.

19:29.702 --> 19:32.904
Mom says that you guys might be
able to make this all go away?

19:32.989 --> 19:35.456
Uh, I might be able to do
something about the photos...

19:35.542 --> 19:37.291
Mel:
But the humiliation

19:37.377 --> 19:39.627
and the trauma,
that can't be erased.

19:39.712 --> 19:42.663
It's a process, and vera's gonna
need a lot of support.

19:42.749 --> 19:44.832
Well, I won't let her
go through this alone.

19:44.918 --> 19:46.167
She's like a mini-you.

19:47.220 --> 19:49.053
Um, okay, look,
I'll try and find proof

19:49.172 --> 19:50.922
that logan sent the photo
and track down

19:51.007 --> 19:53.591
the porn distributors
that it was sent to, all right?

19:53.676 --> 19:55.760
Okay.
Whoa.

19:55.845 --> 19:57.345
Hey. Baby steps.

19:57.430 --> 19:58.479
You're not ready
for where we're going.

19:58.565 --> 20:00.264
Get her a drink.

20:00.350 --> 20:01.682
Nonalcoholic.

20:01.768 --> 20:02.850
Oh, okay.

20:02.936 --> 20:04.101
Hey,

20:04.187 --> 20:05.987
listen, forget about them.

20:06.072 --> 20:08.555
This will give me a chance
to get to know you.

20:08.658 --> 20:11.025
And where you got
those badass shoes.

20:11.110 --> 20:14.028
Come on.
(laughs)

20:14.113 --> 20:15.329
appreciate the help, harry.

20:15.415 --> 20:16.614
Live to serve.

20:16.699 --> 20:18.899
Don't appreciate being
spied on, though.

20:19.002 --> 20:22.703
See you found the, uh, tracker.

20:22.789 --> 20:26.073
Listen, if it's any consolation,
we did it out of love.

20:26.175 --> 20:28.459
I mean, can you really
blame us for worrying

20:28.544 --> 20:30.011
after what quinn
did to bishop?

20:30.096 --> 20:32.263
I told you, I've got this.

20:32.382 --> 20:36.100
Now, how about a little less
love and a little more trust?

20:36.219 --> 20:38.185
Now,

20:38.271 --> 20:39.437
can you help my daughter?

20:39.555 --> 20:41.188
Right.

20:41.274 --> 20:42.390
The fbi has been
largely ineffective

20:42.475 --> 20:44.525
when it comes
to this kind of cybercrime,

20:44.611 --> 20:47.311
but that's because they have a
pesky little thing called rules.

20:47.397 --> 20:49.363
You know, they have
to play fair, whereas, uh...

20:49.449 --> 20:51.866
Me, you know, not so much.

20:51.951 --> 20:54.785
One of the challenges of being
dead these last few years

20:54.904 --> 20:58.906
was making sure there wasn't
a trace of me on the internet--

20:58.992 --> 21:01.075
especially my picture--
and I accomplished that

21:01.160 --> 21:06.380
by inventing a bot specifically
designed to erase my image.

21:06.466 --> 21:07.715
So you can do the same for vera.

21:07.800 --> 21:10.051
I might be able to,
with some tweaks.

21:10.136 --> 21:12.119
While I'm at it, I can also
probably make a connection

21:12.221 --> 21:15.423
to the dirtbag-- I'm sorry,
to the, uh, "wayward teen"--

21:15.508 --> 21:17.958
who, uh, sent the picture
around in the first place.

21:18.061 --> 21:20.594
No, you had it right
the first time.

21:20.680 --> 21:23.731
You know, mel's right, though.

21:23.816 --> 21:27.068
Getting rid of these photos
is really only half the battle.

21:27.153 --> 21:29.470
And vera's really lucky
to have a pal like dee

21:29.572 --> 21:32.440
to see her through
this whole thing.

21:32.525 --> 21:34.942
(phone buzzing)

21:35.028 --> 21:37.078
I got to take this.
Mm.

21:38.614 --> 21:39.497
Hey.

21:39.615 --> 21:40.948
How's it going with delgado?

21:41.034 --> 21:42.917
So far, the guy's a rock.

21:43.002 --> 21:44.368
We're getting nothing.

21:44.454 --> 21:45.586
It's still early.

21:45.672 --> 21:47.421
Not anymore. Langley called.

21:47.507 --> 21:50.541
Given omar's stature, the
director has taken an interest.

21:50.626 --> 21:53.844
He wants to take custody,
rendition him offshore.

21:53.963 --> 21:56.547
No. I'll lose my access.

21:56.632 --> 21:58.549
My chance to get to quinn.

21:58.634 --> 21:59.633
When are they going to move him?

21:59.719 --> 22:00.801
Tomorrow morning.

22:00.887 --> 22:03.354
I want a crack at him first.

22:06.225 --> 22:07.558
Everything okay?

22:07.643 --> 22:10.895
Yeah, just aunt vi
checking on dee.

22:10.980 --> 22:12.229
Everything's fine.

22:13.900 --> 22:16.283
No, we go way back.

22:16.369 --> 22:19.987
Your mom and I have known
each other since before

22:20.073 --> 22:22.289
she even met your dad.
What?

22:22.375 --> 22:24.858
Yeah. She's always been
a force of nature.

22:24.961 --> 22:26.293
Wow, so, she literally saved

22:26.379 --> 22:28.496
all those schoolgirls
from insurgents?

22:28.581 --> 22:31.532
Seven armed hostage-takers,
and, yeah,

22:31.634 --> 22:35.052
because of your mom,
everyone made it out alive.

22:35.171 --> 22:39.807
Wow, that is... Intense.

22:41.677 --> 22:43.144
You know, she never really
tells me any of that stuff.

22:43.229 --> 22:45.012
Oh, well, that's 'cause
she doesn't want to brag

22:45.098 --> 22:46.564
about all the good
that she does.

22:47.600 --> 22:49.066
But what she does
brag about,

22:49.185 --> 22:51.185
a lot, is you.

22:51.270 --> 22:52.937
She talks about me?

22:53.022 --> 22:55.106
(laughs):
Are you kidding me? Yeah.

22:55.191 --> 22:56.524
We know things about you

22:56.609 --> 22:57.908
you don't want to know
that we know.

22:58.027 --> 23:00.111
(laughs):
Okay?

23:00.196 --> 23:01.445
You're surprised?

23:01.531 --> 23:03.230
Yeah, I mean, I don't know.

23:03.332 --> 23:05.065
I just, I figured,
like, when she was working,

23:05.168 --> 23:08.536
she kind of shut out
the mom part of her brain.

23:09.589 --> 23:11.372
No.

23:11.457 --> 23:14.125
That's what makes robyn
so special.

23:14.210 --> 23:16.076
She never
loses sight

23:16.179 --> 23:20.548
of what's important,
and to her, that's you.

23:22.685 --> 23:24.802
I know you're not
telling stories about me.

23:24.887 --> 23:26.637
(gasps)
I would never.

23:26.722 --> 23:28.189
(laughter)
harry's on the case,

23:28.274 --> 23:30.057
but it, uh, may take some time.

23:30.143 --> 23:32.193
Okay.

23:32.278 --> 23:34.895
School night.
Got to get you home.

23:34.981 --> 23:36.614
Aww, come on,
just a little longer?

23:36.732 --> 23:38.365
It was lovely meeting you.
(laughs):
Yes.

23:38.451 --> 23:40.234
Finally.

23:40.319 --> 23:42.987
And now you know we're here
if you need us, okay?

23:43.072 --> 23:45.739
Aww. (laughs)

23:45.825 --> 23:46.874
we got her.

23:46.959 --> 23:47.958
Delilah:
Thank you.

23:48.077 --> 23:49.660
Aww, you're welcome, sweetie.

23:49.745 --> 23:51.212
Good night.

23:52.632 --> 23:55.749
Thanks. For trusting me.

23:59.422 --> 24:00.721
Any movement?

24:00.807 --> 24:02.756
None. What's your plan?

24:02.842 --> 24:05.009
Robyn:
There's only one way
to get information

24:05.094 --> 24:07.461
out of someone like this.

24:07.563 --> 24:09.396
You have to gain their trust.

24:10.817 --> 24:12.066
(door opens)

24:15.488 --> 24:17.404
thought you might be thirsty.

24:18.941 --> 24:21.859
Please, I'm not a child.

24:21.944 --> 24:24.028
Step one, earn their trust.

24:27.783 --> 24:30.451
Fine. Let's get to it.

24:32.622 --> 24:33.820
In eight hours,

24:33.923 --> 24:35.289
you'll be renditioned offshore,

24:35.374 --> 24:36.957
where you'll be
repeatedly tortured

24:37.043 --> 24:40.761
on a daily basis,
possibly for years.

24:41.881 --> 24:44.231
If you tell me what
quinn is planning,

24:44.333 --> 24:46.467
I can make sure
that doesn't happen.

24:46.552 --> 24:49.436
I assure you,
it will never come to that.

24:49.522 --> 24:51.605
My people will come for me.

24:51.691 --> 24:54.808
Your people don't know
where you are.

24:54.894 --> 24:57.611
And in just a few hours,
you are going to disappear

24:57.713 --> 25:02.149
off this earth, so you may
want to reconsider that.

25:02.235 --> 25:03.567
Now,

25:03.653 --> 25:05.953
where is quinn?

25:06.055 --> 25:07.705
What's he planning?

25:14.080 --> 25:16.130
(exhales)

25:21.837 --> 25:23.888
(sighs)

25:50.066 --> 25:52.433
I told you,
you're wasting your breath.

25:52.535 --> 25:55.002
And you're running out of time.

25:55.087 --> 25:58.339
You think that I fear torture?

25:58.424 --> 26:00.457
Small price to pay
for what's coming.

26:01.460 --> 26:02.626
What's coming?

26:02.712 --> 26:04.545
New day.

26:04.630 --> 26:07.348
You know what? I'm done.

26:09.051 --> 26:11.969
What's coming?
You tell me or I swear to god,

26:12.054 --> 26:13.804
I'll put a bullet
through your head.

26:13.889 --> 26:16.423
(explosion)

26:16.525 --> 26:17.858
(alarm sounding)
(gunfire)

26:17.944 --> 26:19.526
told you they'd find me.

26:19.612 --> 26:22.229
We've been breached.
We have to go.

26:24.817 --> 26:26.700
How did they find us?
I don't know.

26:27.954 --> 26:29.737
Back exit. Go, go, go.

26:31.490 --> 26:33.157
No!

26:33.242 --> 26:35.042
♪ ♪

26:35.127 --> 26:37.578
come on. Let's go.

26:37.663 --> 26:39.713
Mccall. Mccall!

26:50.676 --> 26:51.675
She left again.

26:51.761 --> 26:54.044
Last night, after
I went to bed.

26:54.146 --> 26:55.396
Come on.

27:06.776 --> 27:08.392
With quinn's compliments.

27:08.494 --> 27:09.827
We're all clear.

27:09.912 --> 27:11.228
No one's following.

27:11.330 --> 27:14.081
We're headed
to the transfer point.

27:14.200 --> 27:15.783
He wants to speak with you.

27:17.753 --> 27:19.236
Thanks for the lift.

27:19.338 --> 27:21.088
Quinn:
Do I need to worry?

27:21.207 --> 27:23.040
No, they know nothing
about the operation.

27:23.125 --> 27:25.926
Yet somehow they found you.

27:26.045 --> 27:27.428
Well, my people
are looking into it.

27:27.546 --> 27:30.180
They seemed to know about you,
but not about the attack.

27:30.266 --> 27:31.715
What's our status?

27:32.768 --> 27:34.251
All the material
is now in the country,

27:34.353 --> 27:36.553
all the target areas
have been selected.

27:36.639 --> 27:39.273
And that's how you
gain their trust.

27:39.392 --> 27:41.358
Target areas?

27:41.444 --> 27:43.193
They're planning an attack.

27:45.064 --> 27:46.930
Were there any issues
with the materials?

27:47.033 --> 27:48.148
You know

27:48.234 --> 27:49.733
I don't like surprises.

27:49.819 --> 27:51.151
Everything is on track.

27:51.237 --> 27:52.986
With your suggested
distribution of the explosive,

27:53.072 --> 27:54.571
our models show
the radiation cloud

27:54.657 --> 27:56.040
will affect most of manhattan.

27:56.125 --> 27:57.241
Radiation?

27:57.326 --> 27:59.376
He's talking about a dirty bomb.

28:00.329 --> 28:02.713
Are we still on schedule?

28:02.798 --> 28:07.084
Yeah, it's still next week,
of course, but, uh...

28:11.724 --> 28:13.757
(gun clicking)

28:16.512 --> 28:18.178
thanks for the info, mate.

28:19.315 --> 28:20.630
If a dirty bomb
blows in manhattan...

28:20.733 --> 28:22.566
It would take down the city.

28:22.651 --> 28:24.234
Poison hundreds of thousands.

28:24.320 --> 28:27.237
Make it uninhabitable for years.

28:27.323 --> 28:29.356
(indistinct chatter)

28:38.701 --> 28:40.501
hey, um, have you seen
vera today?

28:40.619 --> 28:42.419
Uh-uh.
No.

28:42.505 --> 28:45.089
Hey, did you see vera?
No.

28:46.092 --> 28:47.591
Hey, colin?

28:47.676 --> 28:49.543
Was vera in homeroom?
No.

28:49.628 --> 28:51.828
Hope she's okay, though.
That had to be rough.

28:51.931 --> 28:53.881
(exhales)

28:53.966 --> 28:56.300
(laughter)

28:56.385 --> 28:58.385
(laughter)
delilah:
Hey!

28:58.471 --> 28:59.686
What are you doing?

29:00.723 --> 29:02.272
Okay, seriously?

29:03.893 --> 29:05.842
What if this was you?

29:05.945 --> 29:08.011
Or you? Or you, tori?

29:08.114 --> 29:10.731
I mean, what if your body
was plastered

29:10.816 --> 29:12.616
on every phone in school, just..

29:12.701 --> 29:15.819
Random creeps
just perving on you?

29:15.905 --> 29:18.855
I mean,
don't you get it?

29:18.958 --> 29:20.958
This could be any one of us.

29:21.043 --> 29:23.544
It could still be any one of us.

29:23.662 --> 29:26.363
(crying softly)

29:26.465 --> 29:30.134
she has been violated,
and she is in pain.

29:30.219 --> 29:32.052
We should be
supporting her.

29:32.171 --> 29:34.138
I...

29:34.223 --> 29:38.725
Aren't there enough trolls
tearing us down all the time?

29:38.844 --> 29:40.844
(school bell rings)

29:49.522 --> 29:51.572
(phone buzzes)

29:56.946 --> 29:59.396
(line ringing)

29:59.498 --> 30:01.448
(quietly): Vera,
please answer, please answer.

30:01.534 --> 30:03.116
Please answer. Come on.

30:03.202 --> 30:06.069
Vera:
Hey, it's vera, leave a message.

30:06.172 --> 30:08.572
Hey, vera, um, it's me.

30:08.674 --> 30:11.675
Please call me.
I'm-I'm freaking out here.

30:11.760 --> 30:14.344
I need to hear from you.

30:14.430 --> 30:15.679
(exhales)

30:21.854 --> 30:23.220
(school bell rings)

30:27.643 --> 30:29.092
mel:
Babe,

30:29.195 --> 30:30.394
did you even sleep?

30:30.479 --> 30:31.761
I couldn't.

30:31.864 --> 30:34.431
Uh, someone on the 'net
is hunting my eraser bot.

30:34.533 --> 30:36.733
Every time it tries
to destroy vera's photo,

30:36.819 --> 30:39.603
my code just gets obliterated.

30:39.705 --> 30:41.271
Your code? How's that possible?

30:41.373 --> 30:42.456
I don't know. It's coming from

30:42.575 --> 30:44.791
a-a russian porn farm that feeds

30:44.910 --> 30:46.293
dozens of sites.

30:46.412 --> 30:49.129
They're the ones distributing
the-the pictures of vera,

30:49.248 --> 30:51.999
and from the looks of it,
hundreds of other stolen images.

30:52.084 --> 30:55.285
So, you spent all night
looking at porn?

30:55.387 --> 30:57.221
Yeah, but honey,
it's the, it's the icky porn.

30:57.306 --> 31:00.674
All my personal porn
is ethically sourced.

31:00.759 --> 31:02.292
So why russia?

31:02.394 --> 31:04.011
They've been using sites
like this for years

31:04.096 --> 31:06.346
to infect our decadent
western computers

31:06.432 --> 31:07.598
with malware and sleeper code.

31:07.683 --> 31:10.300
I s-- okay, I'm trying
to get into this system,

31:10.402 --> 31:12.736
but something
is fighting me.

31:12.821 --> 31:14.688
I've never seen code like this
in my entire life.

31:14.773 --> 31:15.906
Luka:
Hey, you!
Okay.

31:16.008 --> 31:16.907
Oh. Hey.
All right, okay.

31:16.992 --> 31:17.908
Who's that?
I don't know.

31:17.993 --> 31:19.192
Uh, can he see us?

31:19.278 --> 31:20.744
I don't think so.

31:20.829 --> 31:25.649
You, american ip trying
to get in my system.

31:25.751 --> 31:28.151
Stay out, or next time,

31:28.254 --> 31:29.453
I'm not so nice.

31:29.538 --> 31:32.506
Next time,
I kill your entire system.

31:32.625 --> 31:34.758
Hey, you listen to me, okay?

31:34.843 --> 31:36.159
Whoever you are.

31:36.262 --> 31:39.346
What you're doing
is a form of cyberterrorism,

31:39.465 --> 31:40.797
and exploitation, okay?

31:40.883 --> 31:43.600
So if you don't stop
right now...

31:43.686 --> 31:45.519
Blah, blah, blah.

31:45.638 --> 31:48.355
Now shut up and go away.

31:48.474 --> 31:50.307
He kicked me off his system.
What?

31:50.392 --> 31:53.277
How'd he do that?
I don't know.

31:53.362 --> 31:55.028
(phone ringing)

31:56.565 --> 31:58.615
yep, hey, what's up?

32:01.370 --> 32:02.402
Delilah.

32:02.488 --> 32:04.237
Hey, hey. Um, is my mom here?

32:04.323 --> 32:05.572
No, we haven't seen her. Why?

32:05.658 --> 32:06.990
I've been calling her,
like, a million times

32:07.076 --> 32:07.991
and she's not answering.

32:08.077 --> 32:09.326
Okay, okay. What's wrong?

32:09.411 --> 32:11.528
It's vera, okay?
She wasn't at school today,

32:11.630 --> 32:13.246
she's not at home
and she just sent this.

32:13.332 --> 32:14.665
Oh...
I think she's gonna
hurt herself.

32:14.750 --> 32:15.749
Harry:
Oh, god.

32:15.834 --> 32:17.501
Harry?
Okay, all right, look,

32:17.586 --> 32:18.835
go to the car, text me the
number, I'll track her phone.
Yeah.

32:18.921 --> 32:20.870
Okay, it's this way, honey.
Let's go.

32:20.973 --> 32:22.422
All right, we've rung the bell.

32:22.508 --> 32:25.142
Fbi, nsc, homeland.

32:25.227 --> 32:27.594
We're scrambling
a response team, but, mccall...

32:29.014 --> 32:31.315
They wanted to know where
the information was coming from.

32:31.400 --> 32:33.817
I had to tell them
you were involved.

32:33.902 --> 32:36.987
Damn it, griffin. I told you
I couldn't be exposed.

32:37.072 --> 32:39.022
You know what's at stake.

32:39.108 --> 32:40.691
No one knows quinn like you.

32:40.776 --> 32:42.659
You know how he
works, how he thinks.

32:42.745 --> 32:44.411
Hell, we don't even
know what he wants.

32:44.530 --> 32:45.996
It's obvious what he wants.

32:46.081 --> 32:47.331
Why don't you people
see that?

32:47.416 --> 32:50.917
Every action, every move
has been about one thing.

32:51.036 --> 32:52.669
Creating instability.

32:52.755 --> 32:54.838
China,
north korea, russia.

32:54.923 --> 32:57.374
They all want to push us off
the world stage,

32:57.459 --> 32:59.909
but no one wants a war.

33:00.012 --> 33:02.713
What happens
if that bomb goes off?

33:02.798 --> 33:06.133
When, suddenly, you have
two million american refugees

33:06.218 --> 33:07.801
looking for shelter?

33:07.886 --> 33:11.688
When the center
of free trade collapses?

33:11.774 --> 33:13.757
How long will it take us
to recover?

33:13.859 --> 33:16.226
But what's in it for quinn?
Is it money?

33:16.311 --> 33:18.145
If he pulls this off,

33:18.230 --> 33:21.815
all of our enemies will be
lining up to kiss the ring.

33:21.900 --> 33:23.817
He'll have
real currency:

33:23.902 --> 33:25.619
Power.

33:27.573 --> 33:31.041
And all because your bosses
let him go.

33:33.746 --> 33:35.829
Mccall, wait.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.617
They want you to lead
the task force.

33:40.719 --> 33:43.170
If anyone can
stop quinn...

33:44.173 --> 33:45.338
...It's you.

33:48.010 --> 33:50.060
(phone chiming)

33:54.149 --> 33:56.132
she's somewhere in midtown, I
can't get a lock on her signal.

33:56.235 --> 33:59.236
She's near lexington and 41st.

33:59.321 --> 34:00.637
Oh, god, I know
where she's going.

34:00.739 --> 34:02.272
You sure?

34:02.357 --> 34:04.691
Um, the hotel, the hotel where
we had our sophomore dance.

34:04.777 --> 34:05.909
Okay, she and logan

34:05.994 --> 34:07.077
went up
to the rooftop.

34:07.162 --> 34:09.579
It's-it's where they had
their first kiss.

34:09.665 --> 34:11.531
All right, I'll have the nypd
meet you there.

34:11.617 --> 34:12.833
(phone buzzing)

34:14.787 --> 34:16.870
mom. Hey, where are you?

34:16.955 --> 34:19.039
My phone was out of cell range.
What's wrong?

34:19.124 --> 34:21.591
It's vera. Okay, she may
be trying to kill herself.

34:21.677 --> 34:24.094
Um, I'm with mel. We think
we know where she's going.

34:24.196 --> 34:26.430
Okay, hang tight, baby girl.
I'm on my way.

34:26.515 --> 34:27.764
Okay.

34:40.612 --> 34:41.511
No!

34:41.613 --> 34:43.146
Vera, don't.

34:43.232 --> 34:44.481
Don't come any closer.

34:50.139 --> 34:52.289
Hey, no, no. She trusts me.

34:56.812 --> 34:58.395
Vera?

34:58.480 --> 35:00.630
Please, just stay back.

35:00.732 --> 35:03.767
Vera, I just want
to talk to you.

35:03.852 --> 35:05.602
Why'd you have to come?

35:05.687 --> 35:07.470
'cause I care about you.

35:07.573 --> 35:09.406
I don't want to lose you.

35:09.508 --> 35:12.993
Vera, you're really scaring me,
okay? Aren't you scared?

35:13.996 --> 35:15.829
Yes, I'm scared.

35:17.866 --> 35:20.316
But I'm also terrified that
every time I talk to someone,

35:20.419 --> 35:24.037
I'll wonder,
do they know?

35:24.123 --> 35:26.006
And all I'll want to do is die.

35:28.794 --> 35:31.261
Nothing I've ever done
matters anymore.

35:31.346 --> 35:33.463
No, vera, it does.

35:33.549 --> 35:35.465
It matters to me.

35:35.551 --> 35:37.601
You matter to me.

35:40.055 --> 35:41.638
Okay, what would I do
without my friend

35:41.723 --> 35:44.107
who speaks three languages?

35:44.193 --> 35:45.675
My friend who shared
half of her sandwich with me

35:45.777 --> 35:46.877
when my lunch got stolen.

35:46.979 --> 35:50.113
The friend who let
me hold her hand

35:50.199 --> 35:53.867
and cry all over her
when jason was killed.

35:53.986 --> 35:55.051
Do you remember
how we felt

35:55.154 --> 35:57.537
after he was gone?

35:57.656 --> 36:00.040
How much we miss him?

36:00.159 --> 36:02.559
How much we knew he wanted
to give to the world?

36:04.696 --> 36:06.913
That can't
happen to you.

36:06.999 --> 36:09.332
The world needs you.

36:09.434 --> 36:11.751
It'd be an awful place
if you were not here.

36:11.837 --> 36:12.969
I mean, think about
your little brother.

36:13.071 --> 36:15.005
He adores you.

36:15.090 --> 36:17.174
Henry.

36:17.276 --> 36:19.259
Vera, look at me. Look.

36:19.344 --> 36:20.777
What logan did was awful.

36:20.846 --> 36:24.681
But there are people
who love you.

36:24.766 --> 36:27.884
There are people
who will stand with you.

36:27.986 --> 36:30.654
But we can't stand with you
if you're not there.

36:33.859 --> 36:37.527
Because, as you know,
winning the race

36:37.613 --> 36:39.696
means showing your face.

36:41.200 --> 36:42.532
Okay?

36:42.618 --> 36:43.867
Please.

36:49.208 --> 36:50.540
Come on.

36:55.681 --> 36:57.047
It's okay.

36:57.149 --> 36:59.182
I got you, okay?

37:04.189 --> 37:06.556
She's pretty special,
your kid.

37:06.642 --> 37:08.558
Yeah, she is.

37:10.195 --> 37:12.562
Gonna tell me
where you were?

37:14.533 --> 37:16.399
Later.

37:23.659 --> 37:26.442
Sorry you couldn't reach me,

37:26.545 --> 37:28.912
but it looks like you did
all right on your own.

37:28.997 --> 37:30.914
I wasn't lone.

37:31.016 --> 37:32.832
You made sure of it.

37:34.303 --> 37:37.721
And you're always with me,
even when you're not.

37:37.823 --> 37:41.558
So... Thank you, mom.

37:43.395 --> 37:46.096
(indistinct conversation)

37:52.521 --> 37:55.322
that girl's got some
big challenges ahead.

37:55.440 --> 38:00.010
Recovering from something
like this is no easy feat.

38:00.112 --> 38:02.028
(phone buzzing)

38:06.618 --> 38:08.285
it's okay. Go.

38:09.921 --> 38:11.538
I get it now.

38:11.623 --> 38:14.257
Why you're not there sometimes
and why you do what you do.

38:14.359 --> 38:17.427
I can't even imagine
what would've happened

38:17.512 --> 38:19.462
if I hadn't been there for vera.

38:27.556 --> 38:28.671
Hey.

38:28.774 --> 38:30.056
Griffin:
Hey. Things are moving fast.

38:30.142 --> 38:31.474
Task force is coming together.

38:31.560 --> 38:33.893
The director needs an answer.
Will you lead it?

38:37.733 --> 38:39.316
I'm in.

38:39.401 --> 38:41.284
On one condition.

38:41.370 --> 38:44.070
I'm gonna need
my people on it, too.

38:45.490 --> 38:47.957
Honey, you have to sleep.

38:48.043 --> 38:50.960
Mm. Not until I get
all these pictures down.

38:51.046 --> 38:52.996
I think I figured out
why the guy's code is so fire.

38:53.081 --> 38:54.497
All right?

38:54.583 --> 38:57.033
He's former fsb cybersecurity.
Russian intelligence?

38:57.135 --> 38:59.135
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, maybe you don't
mess with him, then.

38:59.237 --> 39:00.720
That's what paulie said to rocky

39:00.839 --> 39:02.222
about drago, okay?

39:02.341 --> 39:04.174
But apollo creed
needs to be avenged.

39:04.276 --> 39:06.376
Apollo creed, huh?
Anyway, the point is,

39:06.478 --> 39:07.677
I think I found a way
into his system.

39:07.763 --> 39:09.112
See, he's got a vulnerability,

39:09.214 --> 39:11.264
which I'm about to exploit
right now.

39:11.350 --> 39:13.850
Again, american ip?
(alarm sounding)

39:13.935 --> 39:15.485
I warned you.
(laughs)

39:15.587 --> 39:16.853
harry? What's happening?

39:16.938 --> 39:18.271
He's breaching my system.

39:18.357 --> 39:19.856
Then why are you smiling?

39:19.941 --> 39:21.524
Because that's
the vulnerability.

39:21.610 --> 39:23.443
Right? See,
when he attacked me,

39:23.528 --> 39:25.829
he had to open up his system.
Which is allowing me now

39:25.914 --> 39:27.580
to do this.

39:29.918 --> 39:31.901
What's happening?

39:32.003 --> 39:34.337
Oh, I'm just, uh,
nuking your entire system.

39:34.423 --> 39:35.905
Right now my malware

39:36.007 --> 39:39.742
is multiplying and destroying
every single porn site

39:39.845 --> 39:41.044
that you're connected to.

39:41.129 --> 39:43.930
It's also turning
your servers into bricks.

39:44.049 --> 39:46.582
Except for the one in your
apartment, which is right now

39:46.685 --> 39:49.352
sending pro-ukraine propaganda
to the kremlin.

39:49.454 --> 39:52.922
<i>Dasvidaniya,</i> buddy.
Have a nice time in siberia.

39:53.024 --> 39:54.524
(laughs) wait, so does
this mean that...?

39:54.609 --> 39:58.194
Yes, it does. Right now,
my eraser bot is free

39:58.280 --> 40:01.531
to scrub the internet
with impunity.

40:01.616 --> 40:04.100
(laughs):
Oh, hey. Perfect timing.

40:04.202 --> 40:05.952
My bot
is currently seeking

40:06.071 --> 40:07.787
and destroying every
single porn fake of vera.

40:07.906 --> 40:09.639
That's great.

40:09.741 --> 40:10.740
Doesn't sound great.

40:10.826 --> 40:13.943
It's not that. It's about quinn.

40:14.045 --> 40:17.113
He's gonna hit new york
with a dirty bomb.

40:17.215 --> 40:19.449
(school bell rings)
vera:
I don't think I can do this.

40:19.551 --> 40:22.051
I'm not sure I'm ready
for all the shade or worse,

40:22.137 --> 40:24.254
the pity party?

40:24.339 --> 40:27.123
Wait, no, no, no, no.
What if that doesn't happen?

40:27.225 --> 40:30.093
Okay, v, you've got this, and
I will be right here with you.

40:30.178 --> 40:31.661
(exhales):
Okay.

40:39.404 --> 40:40.737
You did this?

40:42.691 --> 40:44.240
We all did this.

40:45.527 --> 40:47.110
Vera:
Thank you for this.

40:48.997 --> 40:51.865
Dee, you literally
saved my life.

41:12.187 --> 41:13.636
Let's bounce.

41:13.722 --> 41:14.804
Dante:
Logan jeffries.

41:14.890 --> 41:16.940
Detective dante, nypd.

41:18.310 --> 41:19.842
You're under arrest for
sharing an intimate photo

41:19.945 --> 41:22.779
of another individual
without their consent.

41:22.864 --> 41:24.280
I just notified your parents.

41:24.366 --> 41:26.282
What? No, I-I didn't...

41:26.368 --> 41:29.319
Better hope those don't
end up on the internet.

41:29.404 --> 41:31.921
A thing like that could
really hurt your future.

41:37.629 --> 41:39.629
Thank you.
Don't thank me.

41:39.714 --> 41:42.165
Thank the anonymous individual
who sent me proof

41:42.250 --> 41:44.968
that burner belonged to logan.

41:45.053 --> 41:47.203
Glad you called
that number I gave you.

41:47.305 --> 41:50.340
Yeah. Me, too.

41:54.179 --> 41:56.212
Delilah:
<i> Oh, my god,</i>
<i> you should've seen it.</i>

41:56.314 --> 41:57.647
It's like the whole school
had her back.

41:57.732 --> 42:00.066
Ooh, and logan,
when the cops arrested him?

42:00.185 --> 42:02.852
I would have loved to have seen
the look on that boy's face.

42:02.938 --> 42:06.222
Oh, you can.
It is all over the internet.

42:06.324 --> 42:08.157
Dee,

42:08.243 --> 42:09.659
I want you to know,

42:09.744 --> 42:11.578
what you did for your friend,

42:11.696 --> 42:14.163
standing up for
what's right...

42:15.200 --> 42:16.950
...I am so proud of you.

42:18.920 --> 42:20.837
So proud of the woman
you're becoming.

42:20.922 --> 42:22.338
We both are, baby.

42:22.424 --> 42:23.739
And...

42:23.842 --> 42:25.842
I know I've been
secretive lately,

42:25.927 --> 42:27.510
but there's something going on

42:27.596 --> 42:30.346
that you both need
to know about.

42:30.432 --> 42:32.081
