00:18.501 --> 00:21.687
<b>1x06 - Lost Planet</b>

00:22.147 --> 00:24.983
<i>Previously on Green Lantern...</i>

00:25.067 --> 00:27.277
Those power rings are
currently in search of new hosts

00:27.402 --> 00:29.279
or en route back to Oa.

00:29.321 --> 00:30.906
Once I found out Dulac was dead,

00:30.989 --> 00:32.825
I knew his ring would go
to the most worthy person.

00:32.866 --> 00:34.576
Now that you're a Green Lantern,

00:34.576 --> 00:37.621
will you join us in our fight
against the Red Lanterns?

00:37.621 --> 00:40.749
<i> <font color="lime"> sync & correction by Aakrithi Gosh
~ cricwall.in ~  </font> </i>

00:42.417 --> 00:45.295
All right, you jackwagons,
sound off like you mean it. 

00:45.337 --> 00:47.589
- Aya.
- Present.

00:47.631 --> 00:49.633
- Razer.
- Heh.

00:49.633 --> 00:52.010
Jordan. Jordan!

00:52.136 --> 00:56.306
Whoa. Kilowog, there are only
four of us, and we're all here.

00:56.348 --> 00:58.725
We may be a half a universe
away from Oa,

00:58.851 --> 01:01.228
but that doesn't mean we can't
maintain a little discipline.

01:01.353 --> 01:02.771
Discipline's overrated.

01:02.855 --> 01:06.358
And I called this meeting
so we could assess our situation.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.819
Easy. We'll be dead
within a month.

01:08.902 --> 01:12.239
How about we leave the tactical
analysis to sergeant Kilowog.

01:12.322 --> 01:14.199
[sighs]
That's right.

01:14.283 --> 01:17.202
We're in deep umtec splat.

01:17.327 --> 01:18.662
Just when things look
a little hopeful,

01:18.787 --> 01:20.956
we lose our newfound
Green Lantern Iolande,

01:20.998 --> 01:23.250
'cause she won't leave home.

01:23.292 --> 01:26.336
So it's two Green Lanterns fighting
the entire Red Lantern invasion.

01:26.420 --> 01:29.089
Pardon my interruption,
but I've completed my search

01:29.131 --> 01:31.175
for the late Shyir Rev's
power ring.

01:31.216 --> 01:33.260
There is good news
and there is bad news.

01:33.343 --> 01:34.845
Let's have good news.

01:34.928 --> 01:37.181
The ring's signal
emanates from a nearby planet.

01:37.222 --> 01:39.892
Outstanding. Must have found
a replacement G.L.

01:40.017 --> 01:42.352
Could be another recruit for us.
Change course immediately.

01:42.436 --> 01:46.482
<i>I know I'm going to regret
asking, but what's the bad news?</i>

01:46.565 --> 01:52.529
The planet in question will be hit
by that asteroid in 5.2 minutes.

01:57.659 --> 02:00.287
I say we blow that
thing apart before it hits.

02:00.329 --> 02:02.164
Due to the asteroid's
huge mass,

02:02.206 --> 02:05.250
My canons will have no impact,
even at full power.

02:05.334 --> 02:08.628
Maybe we don't need to destroy it.
We just need to slow it down.

02:20.641 --> 02:24.645
Asteroid bearing unchanged.
I cannot maintain this level of output.

02:24.770 --> 02:26.313
What about our personal lanterns?

02:36.657 --> 02:38.867
It's working!

02:38.951 --> 02:40.953
Power drum at critical level.

02:41.078 --> 02:43.247
- Shut it down.
- No, keep firing!

02:43.372 --> 02:44.665
Field regulations, Jordan.

02:44.706 --> 02:46.667
We don't let our batteries
dip below 20%!

02:46.708 --> 02:49.837
Enough with the regulations!
Keep pouring it on!

02:49.962 --> 02:51.463
[groans]

02:52.756 --> 02:54.842
[cracking]

02:59.555 --> 03:02.599
Main and portable batteries
nearing failure threshold.

03:14.278 --> 03:17.156
<i>Talk to me, Aya.
Did we do it?</i>

03:17.239 --> 03:21.201
Asteroid progress delayed.
We now have six hours until impact.

03:21.243 --> 03:23.745
Yeah, great.
We blew all our power doing it.

03:23.829 --> 03:26.832
Now when we go down there,
our rings will be running on fumes.

03:26.874 --> 03:28.917
No one will mind that our
rings are only partially charged

03:28.959 --> 03:30.878
as we rescue them.

03:31.003 --> 03:35.257
Scanners now at limited capacity,
reading few scattered life forms.

03:35.299 --> 03:36.758
Looks like we have six hours to find

03:36.842 --> 03:38.427
the new Green Lantern
recruit down there

03:38.510 --> 03:41.013
and get him and any others
off the planet in one piece.

03:41.096 --> 03:44.224
Shooting from the hip as
usual. Gonna get us all killed.

03:44.349 --> 03:48.771
Jordan, regulations exist for a reason.
They're not suggestions.

03:48.896 --> 03:51.106
And since we're at war,
we should follow them!

03:51.231 --> 03:54.860
I concur. Putting the lives of two
well-trained Green Lanterns at risk

03:54.985 --> 03:58.322
in an effort to save one
untrained novice, is impractical.

03:58.363 --> 04:00.282
Look, I may not have followed
all the regs to the letter,

04:00.365 --> 04:03.118
but there are people on that
planet who need to be rescued,

04:03.160 --> 04:05.162
not to mention a Green Lantern.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.956
And one Green Lantern
can make all the difference.

04:18.675 --> 04:21.386
So, which way?

04:21.428 --> 04:24.389
A strange seismic interference
is disrupting the scanner's ability

04:24.431 --> 04:28.685
to pinpoint the ring's exact location.
But it is in this vicinity.

04:28.727 --> 04:32.993
Then let's move.

04:45.035 --> 04:47.538
We come in peace.

04:47.663 --> 04:50.958
- I've always wanted to say that.
- Why?

04:51.041 --> 04:52.709
Greetings, travelers.

04:52.835 --> 04:55.129
You are well met on this
desolate rock of a planet.

04:55.170 --> 04:56.630
I am Zartok.

04:56.672 --> 04:59.591
My fellow castaways
are Drusa and Grood.

05:00.759 --> 05:01.969
I'm Hal Jordan.

05:02.052 --> 05:04.555
This is Kilowog, Aya and Razer.

05:04.555 --> 05:06.223
Where did your ship crash?

05:06.265 --> 05:10.436
We didn't crash.
We landed just over that rise.

05:10.519 --> 05:14.690
That, what you're holding,
is a Thalian moon staff.

05:14.773 --> 05:18.527
Only soldiers that fought in the last
stand of Thalius Prime wielded that blade.

05:18.652 --> 05:21.363
I know.
I was in that battle.

05:21.405 --> 05:23.198
We're looking
for a Green Lantern, here.

05:23.198 --> 05:26.201
A search, I want to point out,
that is pathetic and pointless.

05:26.201 --> 05:29.997
Look around you.
There's no Green Lantern here.

05:30.122 --> 05:34.376
Oh, ok, we should just give up.
Or we could look for ourselves.

05:34.501 --> 05:36.253
That asteroid's going to hit
in six hours.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.547
We'll get you to safety
before that happens,

05:38.672 --> 05:42.092
but in the meantime, we could use
some help finding our Green Lantern.

05:42.217 --> 05:44.052
You will have our aid.

05:44.094 --> 05:45.345
We'll split into teams.

05:45.429 --> 05:46.638
We can cover
more ground that way.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.098
I'll go with Zartok.

05:48.182 --> 05:51.852
If you don't mind,
I'd like to go with Aya.

05:51.935 --> 05:54.897
Nice to talk with another...
girl for a change.

05:54.897 --> 05:58.650
Must be losing
my game out here.

06:01.110 --> 06:03.697
I work better alone.

06:05.199 --> 06:09.161
Oh. Well, I guess
it's just you and me, pal.

06:17.127 --> 06:19.254
So, Grood...

06:19.296 --> 06:22.049
I bet you're like
a senator on your planet.

06:22.174 --> 06:24.551
A great orator,
a voice to be heard.

06:24.676 --> 06:27.346
No, no, no, wait,
you're a storyteller

06:27.387 --> 06:29.431
who weaves a magic
tapestry of words,

06:29.515 --> 06:32.810
charming everyone around with
your ingenious turn of phrase.

06:41.151 --> 06:44.113
What is it?
Did you find something?

06:46.698 --> 06:49.409
I-- I don't see anything.
What is it I'm supposed to--

06:49.451 --> 06:52.454
[groaning and grunting]

07:00.504 --> 07:02.965
Hey, hey, get off!

07:04.885 --> 07:05.843
[groaning]

07:14.826 --> 07:16.645
[groaning] 

07:20.932 --> 07:24.811
Ok.
That doesn't make any sense.

07:24.895 --> 07:27.981
Hello? Anyone?
Come in!

07:28.065 --> 07:31.234
Maybe this was a really
bad idea after all.

07:31.276 --> 07:35.197
I've been working with
grunts and posers for so long.

07:35.280 --> 07:37.532
It's an honor to be
in the company of a soldier--

07:37.574 --> 07:39.201
A true soldier.

07:39.326 --> 07:42.871
So your leader, Hal Jordan,
disappoints you?

07:42.871 --> 07:44.873
Hal ain't exactly my leader.

07:44.998 --> 07:49.002
In fact, I'm not even sure he's got
the right stuff to lead this war.

07:49.044 --> 07:52.422
But the defenders
of Thalius Prime are legendary.

07:52.422 --> 07:54.633
If it wouldn't be too rude to ask,

07:54.716 --> 07:58.720
I would love to hear of the battle--
the last stand.

07:58.762 --> 08:00.013
It was...

08:00.138 --> 08:05.560
The greatest moment of my life.
A glorious battle.

08:05.644 --> 08:09.356
Never have I seen such bravery,
such soldierly duty.

08:09.398 --> 08:11.191
The cartonian hordes
were terrifying--

08:11.233 --> 08:14.027
murder in the eyes
and thirsting for blood.

08:14.152 --> 08:17.280
A good day to die.

08:21.034 --> 08:23.954
I've been marooned on this
planet for quite some time.

08:24.079 --> 08:26.039
It's so exciting to see you--

08:26.081 --> 08:29.334
A walking, talking
artificial intelligence.

08:29.376 --> 08:32.546
Such technology.
Such perfection.

08:32.629 --> 08:34.089
Perfection is incorrect.

08:34.131 --> 08:39.635
I must continually adjust
a 0,0001% flaw in my programming.

08:39.760 --> 08:42.722
Well, you sure sound
perfect to-- oh, ahh!

08:42.806 --> 08:45.100
[groaning]

08:45.183 --> 08:48.895
Ohh. Stupid.
I twisted it.

08:48.937 --> 08:52.941
I can construct a field dressing
and splint from surrounding materials.

08:53.066 --> 08:54.735
I'd feel better if you took me back

08:54.735 --> 08:56.570
to your ship for medical attention.

08:56.611 --> 08:59.114
Certainly.

09:05.120 --> 09:07.622
[grunting]

09:08.707 --> 09:11.752
[laughter]

09:17.049 --> 09:19.176
Don't turn your back on me!

09:23.430 --> 09:26.266
[birds chirping]

09:30.604 --> 09:32.814
Hold it right there, Grood.

09:46.203 --> 09:47.662
Whoa!

09:52.250 --> 09:54.711
There was much blood.
Many lives lost.

09:54.753 --> 09:57.881
But my battalion
still had fight in 'em.

09:57.923 --> 10:00.550
My personal guards stood
with me in the thick of battle.

10:00.675 --> 10:03.720
The Cardonian horde were
ruthless and relentless.

10:03.804 --> 10:07.224
That Thalian moon staff has probably
seen more action than any of us.

10:07.265 --> 10:10.060
It has earned its place in history.

10:10.102 --> 10:12.813
To be honest, we're here
looking for a ring.

10:12.854 --> 10:16.942
It can be tried to choose one of you to be
a Green Lantern, like us.

10:18.443 --> 10:21.238
Personally, I'm hoping it's you.

10:21.363 --> 10:25.367
Such power would be
a great honor.

10:30.372 --> 10:32.582
This ship is more than my home.

10:32.666 --> 10:34.126
I have never known anything else.

10:34.209 --> 10:37.629
It is correct to state
that I was born on this ship.

10:37.671 --> 10:42.217
- Is this the infirmary?
- That, and numerous other uses.

10:42.259 --> 10:44.261
There is not sufficient space
on the ship,

10:44.261 --> 10:47.264
so each room serves multiple functions.

10:49.975 --> 10:52.436
What's this?

10:52.519 --> 10:55.772
That is the main access panel
to my CPU chamber.

10:55.856 --> 10:58.442
Perfect.

11:13.373 --> 11:20.130
A graveyard of space wrecks.
Rashe pirate ships.

11:20.255 --> 11:22.007
War ships of the Cardonian horde.

11:22.132 --> 11:25.052
Yes. And those are space
clippers of the Tarconian marauders.

11:25.135 --> 11:28.055
Who are you?!
One of the castaways?

11:28.180 --> 11:32.100
Those over there are catty slavers
from Gur. Quite the collection.

11:32.184 --> 11:35.687
All of them seriouy bad people
who have done seriously bad things.

11:35.771 --> 11:38.398
Tell me who you are,
or so help me...

11:38.482 --> 11:40.525
The path they walked
led to their doom.

11:40.567 --> 11:42.736
It is the same path you travel now.

11:42.819 --> 11:45.405
I am Saint Walker.
And you are?

11:45.447 --> 11:47.699
About to kick your smug rear.

11:47.783 --> 11:50.327
That is not a very pleasant name.
Not in the least.

11:50.452 --> 11:54.247
- You got a problem with me?
- Do you have a problem with you?

11:54.372 --> 11:58.335
I only have one problem,
but it's a problem I intend to correct.

11:58.418 --> 12:01.046
[grunts]

12:01.088 --> 12:03.382
Come in.
Can anyone hear me?

12:03.465 --> 12:06.802
How am I going to warn
the others if I can't find them?

12:11.765 --> 12:15.519
Ok...
Well, it's a stretch,

12:15.644 --> 12:19.022
but it's a better lead
than anything else I've got.

12:19.064 --> 12:22.818
And the great battle
of Thalius Prime was over.

12:22.943 --> 12:24.778
What an inspiration.

12:24.820 --> 12:28.365
And what an honor to hear about
it in your words, Zartok.

12:28.448 --> 12:31.993
We would have won if my
battalion hadn't been captured.

12:31.993 --> 12:36.456
You did win! The Cardonian
horde was defeated that day.

12:36.540 --> 12:38.208
Precisely.

12:38.333 --> 12:42.462
Because my battalion
was the Cardonian horde.

12:42.546 --> 12:44.589
And I was their general!

12:46.925 --> 12:49.010
[grunting]

12:58.103 --> 13:00.230
Taste the power of my rage!

13:00.272 --> 13:04.526
Rage has no real power,
or taste, for that matter.

13:04.609 --> 13:06.653
[grunting]

13:06.653 --> 13:09.865
It's the orphan
child of fear and despair.

13:09.990 --> 13:12.325
[grunting]

13:22.669 --> 13:24.379
Moon staff.

13:24.504 --> 13:27.090
Only the defenders of Thalius
Prime carry that weapon.

13:27.215 --> 13:30.802
Yes. And I personally pried
this one from the cold hands

13:30.886 --> 13:34.306
of one of their fallen soldiers
as a trophy.

13:34.306 --> 13:36.808
Ahhh!

13:43.148 --> 13:44.357
Your kicks need work.

13:44.357 --> 13:46.651
A little higher
at the knee, I think.

13:54.910 --> 13:56.828
Speaking of taste, though,

13:56.870 --> 13:58.663
you really should
try this melon, brother.

13:58.705 --> 14:01.458
Very sweet.

14:01.583 --> 14:03.168
[grunting]

14:03.251 --> 14:05.587
You don't deserve
to wield that staff.

14:05.629 --> 14:07.756
You're supposed to be a soldier.

14:07.881 --> 14:10.634
How could you destroy such
good people as the Thalians?

14:10.759 --> 14:13.970
They were brave warriors
that stood with honor!

14:14.012 --> 14:16.181
I massacred them
because they were weak.

14:16.223 --> 14:18.850
[both grunting]

14:22.312 --> 14:24.564
My soldiers
followed orders perfectly,

14:24.606 --> 14:26.608
with unquestioning loyalty!

14:26.691 --> 14:29.403
[both grunting]

14:35.117 --> 14:37.244
If you were truly a soldier,

14:37.327 --> 14:39.204
you would know that blind loyalty

14:39.329 --> 14:42.874
is far better than honor or bravery!

14:42.916 --> 14:45.502
[grunting]

14:56.888 --> 14:59.141
[gasping]

15:02.686 --> 15:05.355
Sit still so I can hit you!

15:05.397 --> 15:08.483
No, brother.
You sit still.

15:08.608 --> 15:11.987
[groaning]

15:12.028 --> 15:14.030
There's a storm coming, brother.

15:14.114 --> 15:17.451
And the galaxy will need everyone
of strong and true heart to survive.

15:17.492 --> 15:20.162
What in the name of Grotz
are you talking about?!

15:20.287 --> 15:22.831
Your anger and rage
may lead to your doom.

15:22.873 --> 15:26.334
Personally, I think
you should avoid that.

15:26.418 --> 15:28.628
But there is always hope.

15:28.670 --> 15:33.425
- You're the Green Lantern.
- No, not me.

15:35.177 --> 15:37.387
I travel a different path.

15:44.227 --> 15:46.313
Nice going, kid.

15:46.396 --> 15:48.899
- You found the ring.
- Actually...

15:48.940 --> 15:51.443
Funny that the ring hasn't
chosen a Green Lantern yet.

15:51.568 --> 15:53.236
Maybe one of the castaways.

15:53.320 --> 15:56.990
[chuckles] No, those castaways
are bad news, trust me.

15:57.115 --> 16:00.243
We need to find the others
and get off this planet... now!

16:03.246 --> 16:05.540
[both grunting]

16:08.568 --> 16:13.782
Good fight, Kilowog.
It is a good ending.

16:13.823 --> 16:16.284
[groaning]

16:16.284 --> 16:18.662
[yelling and grunting]

16:24.960 --> 16:29.881
No.
That's a good ending.

16:33.552 --> 16:38.723
Luckily for you and your friends,
it is a very good day to die.

16:51.550 --> 16:53.052
[console beeps] 

16:53.094 --> 16:55.346
General, what about Grood?

16:55.471 --> 16:57.348
Forget him.
We have his ship now.

16:57.389 --> 16:59.141
Let's get off
this horrible rock.

16:59.266 --> 17:02.269
I look forward to watching that
asteroid from a safe distance

17:02.353 --> 17:04.855
as it obliterates
this accursed planet.

17:04.939 --> 17:09.151
[groans] I'll knock
that smile off his face.

17:15.366 --> 17:19.662
Uh, Kilowog, is there a reason Aya's
flying off and leaving us?

17:19.703 --> 17:23.999
She's not.It's those castaways.
They stole the ship.

17:44.270 --> 17:45.688
Unh!

17:49.525 --> 17:51.277
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

17:55.239 --> 17:56.782
[console beeps]

18:11.505 --> 18:13.841
[grunting]

18:18.679 --> 18:20.639
- Unh!
- Unh!

18:26.270 --> 18:27.980
[groans]

18:37.340 --> 18:38.215
[beeping]

18:48.334 --> 18:50.044
Aya's back online.

18:50.086 --> 18:52.338
We're ready to blow this munktor stand!

18:52.379 --> 18:54.090
Jordan, now!

18:56.092 --> 18:58.636
It doesn't make sense. Why did
the ring stay here on this planet

18:58.761 --> 19:00.888
and not go back to Oa?

19:00.971 --> 19:04.141
Go! Go back to Oa!

19:08.104 --> 19:10.189
It can't be.

19:12.149 --> 19:15.111
Kilowog, take off now.
Right now.

19:15.236 --> 19:17.363
I have to stay behind.
There's something I have to do.

19:17.488 --> 19:18.948
Jordan, time's up.

19:18.989 --> 19:21.367
The ring didn't find
a replacement. We gotta go!

19:21.492 --> 19:24.829
It did. Our hero's
been here the whole time.

19:26.372 --> 19:30.459
Get Aya and Razer off this planet.
Trust me.

19:38.300 --> 19:40.886
I ordered you off this rock.
What are you doing?

19:40.928 --> 19:42.930
I'm disobeying orders.

20:17.923 --> 20:22.678
<i>[booming voice]
I... am... Mogo.</i>

20:22.762 --> 20:25.639
<i>Thank you, Hal Jordan of Earth.</i>

20:25.681 --> 20:28.100
<i>You have saved me.</i>

20:28.142 --> 20:33.147
<i>Rather, by giving me the ring,
by knighting me,</i>

20:33.272 --> 20:38.152
<i>you allowed me the power
to save myself from that asteroid.</i>

20:38.194 --> 20:39.653
Our pleasure.

20:39.779 --> 20:43.199
<i>For countless millennia
I have trapped evildoers</i>

20:43.282 --> 20:46.160
<i>here on my surface until they reform.</i>

20:46.202 --> 20:49.830
<i>I will keep these prisoners
if you do not mind.</i>

20:49.914 --> 20:52.208
Knock yourself out.

20:55.127 --> 20:59.507
<i>You have given me
new purpose, new power.</i>

20:59.548 --> 21:06.305
<i>I am proud to be a Green Lantern.
Very proud.</i>

21:06.430 --> 21:11.811
<i>And I will be here
whenever you have need of me.</i>

21:11.894 --> 21:15.648
I gotta say, Jordan, you're
gathering one unorthodox team,

21:15.773 --> 21:18.275
but it's an honor to be a part of it.

21:18.317 --> 21:21.695
Welcome to the
Green Lantern corps, Mogo.
