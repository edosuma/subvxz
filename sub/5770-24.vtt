I'D LIKE TO SEE, PLEASE.

02:08.476 --> 02:12.088
[Mindy] MRS. HASKELL, WE WERE SO EXCITED WHEN DR. REED ASKED US

02:12.132 --> 02:13.742
TO ASSIST IN YOUR DELIVERY.

02:13.785 --> 02:16.658
IN ALL OF OUR CAREERS, WE HAVE
NEVER DELIVERED TRIPLETS.

02:16.701 --> 02:18.442
NOT WHAT I WOULD
LEAD WITH.

02:18.486 --> 02:20.749
[Jeremy] NOW, THIS IS GOING TO BE A RATHER UNUSUAL DELIVERY,

02:20.792 --> 02:22.359
SO WE DO WANT TO TAKE
EXTRA PRECAUTIONS.

02:22.403 --> 02:25.275
THAT'S WHY WE'VE DECIDED TO WORK
TOGETHER AS A TEAM, CAROL--

02:25.319 --> 02:26.972
ONE PHYSICIAN ASSIGNED
TO EACH BABY.

02:27.016 --> 02:29.758
BUT REST ASSURED THAT
I WILL DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER

02:29.801 --> 02:31.760
TO MAKE SURE THAT MY TRIPLET
IS THE BEST.

02:31.803 --> 02:34.023
BUT I DON'T WANT ONE
OF THEM TO BE THE BEST.

02:34.066 --> 02:34.893
YES, OF COURSE.
WELL...

02:34.937 --> 02:36.547

DANNY, CHRISTINA'S
GONNA LOVE

02:38.941 --> 02:40.029
THAT I TOOK YOU SHOPPING HERE.

02:40.072 --> 02:42.031
THIS PLACE IS LIKE
AN INSANE ASYLUM

02:42.074 --> 02:43.424
FOR ADOLESCENT GIRLS.

02:43.467 --> 02:47.297
NOW, LET ME ASK YOU, IS SHE
MORE OWL OR FIELD MOUSE?

02:47.341 --> 02:49.343
HUH?
WHAT IS HER ESSENCE?

02:49.386 --> 02:50.909
I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN,
I'M JUST--LOOK,

02:50.953 --> 02:52.955
I'M TRYING TO MAKE HER FEEL
MORE COMFORTABLE, OKAY?

02:52.998 --> 02:54.522
I'M EVEN TAKING HER
CAMPING THIS WEEKEND.

02:54.565 --> 02:56.045

OH, MY GOD.

03:02.182 --> 03:03.226
WHAT?
DANNY, THIS IS EERIE.

03:03.270 --> 03:05.097
THIS IS WHY I BELIEVE
IN MYSTICISM.

03:05.141 --> 03:07.535
CHRISTINA AND DANNY.

03:07.578 --> 03:08.710
OF ALL THE LETTERS
IN THE ALPHABET,

03:08.753 --> 03:10.581
THEY HAD THESE TWO

03:10.625 --> 03:12.453
THERE'S AN "R" AND AN "M"
RIGHT THERE.
EHH!

NO, I'M NOT SAYING THAT.

03:22.724 --> 03:23.942
IT'S JUST,
TWO MONTHS AGO,

03:23.986 --> 03:25.292
IF ANYONE HAD EVEN SAID
THE NAME "CHRISTINA,"

03:25.335 --> 03:27.076
YOU WOULD SHATTER WHATEVER
OBJECT YOU WERE HOLDING.

03:27.119 --> 03:29.296

03:54.103 --> 03:56.192
A SINGLE DAY YOU THOUGHT
I WOULD LAST IN HAITI?

03:56.236 --> 03:57.759

PRICE-IS-RIGHTING IT.

03:57.802 --> 04:00.022
THAT'S HOW MY COUSIN SHEENA
WON HER JET-SKI.

04:00.065 --> 04:01.763
ONE TIME, SHE LET ME
RIDE IT IN HER DRIVEWAY.

04:01.806 --> 04:04.287
THAT IS ENOUGH. I WOULD
NORMALLY LOVE THAT ANECDOTE,

04:04.331 --> 04:06.985

07:14.999 --> 07:16.653
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW I WAS
INSANELY COURAGEOUS.

07:16.697 --> 07:17.959

07:28.926 --> 07:29.840
FROM THE BURRITOS.OKAY, JUST TOUCH IT.

07:29.884 --> 07:31.102

I FEEL LIKE I GOT ONE.

07:37.500 --> 07:38.980
NO, THERE'S NOTHING THERE.

07:39.023 --> 07:40.851
I THINK THIS SHOULD BE
THE LAST TICK CHECK

07:40.895 --> 07:41.939
UNTIL WE GET HOME,

08:34.557 --> 08:36.777
OH, IT'S DAVID SEDARIS.
I BOUGHT IT FOR MY SISTER,

08:36.820 --> 08:38.343

SHE'S GONNA GET IT.

08:38.387 --> 08:39.431
YOU'RE BLINDING ME.

08:44.959 --> 08:47.135
I CAN'T REALLY READ
WITHOUT MY LIGHT,

08:47.178 --> 08:48.702
BUT I GUESS

08:51.748 --> 08:53.881
SO, WHEN WE'RE IN HAITI,
HOW MUCH OF THE TIME

08:53.924 --> 08:56.536

12:40.716 --> 12:43.501
AS A MATURE ADULT TO GO

12:43.545 --> 12:44.981
WITH MY BOYFRIEND
OF THREE MONTHS.

12:45.025 --> 12:47.462
BY THE TIME YOU GET BACK,
I'LL PROBABLY BE MARRIED,

12:47.505 --> 12:50.813
LIVING IN NEW JERSEY
WITH A TRACTOR.

12:50.857 --> 12:53.598
YOU KNOW, ONE OF
THOSE LAWNMOWERS YOU--

12:53.642 --> 12:55.862
IT'S WEIRD,
BECAUSE MOST GUYS FREAK OUT

12:55.905 --> 12:58.690
WHEN WOMEN PUSH 'EM TOO FAR
TOO FAST, BUT NOT ME.

12:58.734 --> 13:00.170
I'M NOT THINKING OF
SLIPPING OUT THAT WINDOW,

13:00.214 --> 13:02.694
VANISHING INTO THE NIGHT.
NO WAY, NOT ME.

13:02.738 --> 13:05.088
GUYS DO FREAK OUT
WHEN YOU MOVE THAT FAST.

13:05.132 --> 13:06.829
OH, YEAH.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.833
WHAT'S THIS SHOWER FIXTURE
YOU WANT ME TO SEE SO BADLY?

13:10.877 --> 13:12.487
THAT WAS A LIE.

13:12.530 --> 13:13.531
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.

13:13.575 --> 13:15.490
OH. WHAT'S UP?

13:15.533 --> 13:17.535
CAN I HAVE YOUR HANDS?

13:17.579 --> 13:19.581
I CAN'T GO TO HAITI
WITH YOU

13:19.624 --> 13:21.844
UNLESS WE'RE ENGAGED
TO BE MARRIED.

13:25.021 --> 13:26.457
RE--REALLY?

13:26.501 --> 13:27.589
AND I KNOW THAT
WE'VE ONLY BEEN DATING

13:27.632 --> 13:29.721
FOR, LIKE, THREE MONTHS,
SO I GET WHY

13:29.765 --> 13:31.767
THAT WOULD BE
WAY TOO QUICK FOR YOU.

13:31.811 --> 13:34.683
YEAH.YOU WANT TO HANG OUT WITH
YOUR BROS ON A FRIDAY NIGHT.

13:34.726 --> 13:36.598
YOU DON'T HAVE TO COME HOME
AND HAVE SPAGHETTI DINNER

13:36.641 --> 13:37.860
WITH YOUR WEIRD INDIAN WIFE.

13:37.904 --> 13:39.862
NO ONE SAYS THAT,

13:46.651 --> 13:48.653
WE'LL DO LONG-DISTANCE.
WE'LL WRITE LETTERS AND STUFF.

13:48.697 --> 13:50.220
THIS IS AWESOME.

13:51.482 --> 13:53.049
HEY, UH, PARTY PEOPLE,

13:53.093 --> 13:55.530

YOUR ATTENTION FOR A SECOND?

13:55.573 --> 13:59.316
I JUST WANTED TO SAY
THAT THE DAY I MET MINDY,

13:59.360 --> 14:01.623
I DIDN'T REALIZE I MET
MY FUTURE WIFE.

14:01.666 --> 14:03.755

14:12.939 --> 14:14.723
LOOK, HERE'S THE DEAL.

14:14.766 --> 14:17.291
I JUST HAD A LITTLE RAP "SESH"
WITH THE NOTORIOUS G.O.D.

14:17.334 --> 14:19.989
YOU KNOW WHAT "G" SAID?
"THAT'S YOUR GIRL, DUDE."

14:20.033 --> 14:21.164
AND I SAID, "THANK YOU."

14:21.208 --> 14:22.339
CASEY, I DON'T WANT YOU
TO PROPOSE TO ME,

14:22.383 --> 14:24.298
AND I DON'T WANT TO GO
TO HAITI.
