<i>I had this friend,</i>
<i>back in college.</i>

00:12.753 --> 00:15.989
<i>She used to say there's</i>
<i>someone for everyone.</i>

00:17.044 --> 00:18.612
<i>That no matter who you are,</i>

00:18.707 --> 00:21.943
<i>there's one person out there</i>
<i>who can make you happy.</i>

00:23.287 --> 00:27.791
<i>One person who can</i>
<i>make you whole.</i>

00:27.859 --> 00:31.328
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>if that's true or not,</i>

00:31.395 --> 00:34.831
<i>but it is a comforting idea.</i>

00:34.899 --> 00:37.334
<i>Comforting, that is,</i>
<i>until you start to think about</i>

00:37.401 --> 00:40.504
<i>all the people</i>
<i>who never find "the one."</i>

00:41.539 --> 00:44.608
<i>I mean, it's a big world.</i>

00:44.675 --> 00:47.043
<i>You could spend</i>
<i>your whole life looking</i>

00:47.111 --> 00:49.246
<i>and never find that person.</i>

00:55.086 --> 00:57.487
<i>Or worse,</i>

00:57.555 --> 01:00.524
<i>you could cross paths</i>
<i>with your soul mate</i>

01:00.591 --> 01:02.792
<i>and never even know it.</i>

01:10.434 --> 01:11.801
<i>But what if there was a way</i>

01:11.869 --> 01:14.271
<i>to prevent these</i>
<i>missed connections?</i>

01:22.547 --> 01:25.615
<i>What if you could look at</i>
<i>the person who's right for you</i>

01:25.683 --> 01:28.018
<i>and just know?</i>

01:30.288 --> 01:32.822
<i>Say you were born</i>
<i>with something</i>

01:32.890 --> 01:37.894
<i>that only one other person</i>
<i>in the world had.</i>

01:37.962 --> 01:41.665
<i>Then you'd never walk away</i>
<i>from your one true love.</i>

01:48.205 --> 01:51.675
<i>Wouldn't it be nice?</i>

01:51.742 --> 01:54.110
<i>Wouldn't it be</i>

02:06.991 --> 02:08.191
Hello.

02:08.258 --> 02:10.961
Hey, it's Lee.
Sorry to call so early,

02:11.027 --> 02:13.063
but we just found another
woman's body in Centennial Park.

02:13.130 --> 02:14.464
Oh, no.

02:14.532 --> 02:16.933
Strangled with a length of wire
and left on a jogging path,

02:17.001 --> 02:18.268
same as the first two victims.

02:18.336 --> 02:20.537
Manny's on his way,
asked me to give you a call.

02:20.605 --> 02:22.606
I'll be right there.

02:23.708 --> 02:25.508
Hey. Honey, I gotta go.

02:25.576 --> 02:27.978
Yeah, I heard.

02:28.045 --> 02:30.046
Okay.

02:36.787 --> 02:39.456
Mm. What was that about?

02:39.523 --> 02:42.926
I'm so glad
we found each other.

02:42.994 --> 02:44.995
Mm-hmm.

Hey.

03:43.197 --> 03:45.932
Where's Mommy?

03:46.000 --> 03:48.868
Oh. Mommy had to go to work.

03:48.936 --> 03:50.203
Why? What's wrong?

03:50.271 --> 03:51.671
I had a bad dream.

03:51.739 --> 03:53.807
A really bad dream.

03:53.874 --> 03:56.343
The kind where somebody
gets murdered.

03:57.712 --> 03:59.312
<i>Sweetie,</i>
<i>I understand you're scared,</i>

03:59.380 --> 04:02.315
but you really have
to tell me what you saw.

04:02.383 --> 04:04.417
Hmm?

04:04.485 --> 04:05.919
Honey, listen,

04:05.986 --> 04:09.189
if somebody got hurt, or-or
somebody's going to get hurt,

04:09.256 --> 04:10.924
we want to be able
to help them.

04:10.991 --> 04:13.660
Right? Right? Yeah?

04:13.728 --> 04:15.895
Okay.
Hey, Marie,

04:15.963 --> 04:18.264
how many, um, how many
people were in your dream?

04:18.332 --> 04:20.533
Two.

04:20.601 --> 04:23.837
Okay. And, uh, and do you
know where they were?

04:23.904 --> 04:25.372
They were in a hotel.

04:25.439 --> 04:28.942
I know 'cause there was
a towel on the floor that said

04:29.009 --> 04:31.511
Shan... Shan-gri-la.

04:31.579 --> 04:33.513
Okay, the-the Shangri-La Hotel.

04:33.581 --> 04:35.849
See? That was easy.

04:35.916 --> 04:38.418
And these people, they were...

04:38.486 --> 04:40.687
There was a lady,
and a really angry man,

04:40.755 --> 04:43.356
and they were in
their underpants.

04:43.424 --> 04:44.624
Their underpants?

04:44.692 --> 04:46.593
And the really

04:46.660 --> 04:52.465
angry man and the lady
were wrestling on the bed.

04:52.533 --> 04:54.734
Wait. This...
this happened on a bed?

04:54.802 --> 04:56.403
He was biting her neck,

04:56.470 --> 04:58.738
and she was scratching
his back,

04:58.806 --> 05:01.441
and she kept screaming,
"Yes, yes, yes!"

05:01.509 --> 05:02.776
But it didn't matter.

05:02.843 --> 05:04.811
Even though
he got his answer,

05:04.879 --> 05:08.248
he kept wrestling her.

05:08.315 --> 05:10.116
Ah-ha.

05:11.552 --> 05:13.653
You want to tell her,
or should I?

05:13.721 --> 05:15.455
Tell me what?

05:15.523 --> 05:17.223
Hey, Marie, I, uh...

05:17.291 --> 05:20.059
We don't think that you saw
somebody getting murdered.

05:20.127 --> 05:22.061
No?

05:22.129 --> 05:23.997
Far from it. I mean,
those people, they were...

05:24.064 --> 05:25.064
Hey!

05:25.132 --> 05:26.099
What?

05:26.167 --> 05:27.233
I want to know.

05:27.301 --> 05:28.701
They were...
they were playing.

05:29.904 --> 05:31.271
They... they liked each other.

05:31.338 --> 05:32.439
So they were playing.

05:32.540 --> 05:35.108
But why didn't they have
any clothes on?

05:35.176 --> 05:38.111
I'm thinking
that they were washing them.

05:38.179 --> 05:41.948
Yeah. They were probably
just waiting for the clothes

05:42.016 --> 05:43.750
to come out... of the dryer.

05:43.818 --> 05:46.052
You think that's what it was?

05:47.254 --> 05:50.657
I think that's a very
distinct possibility.

05:50.724 --> 05:52.492
Their clothes
were in the hotel dryer,

05:52.560 --> 05:54.527
and they had
to wait for them.

05:54.595 --> 05:56.463
So they played.

05:56.530 --> 05:57.664
On the bed.

05:57.731 --> 05:58.731
Yep.

05:59.767 --> 06:00.700
Yep.

06:00.768 --> 06:02.302
Makes sense.

06:02.369 --> 06:04.170
Okay.

06:05.739 --> 06:07.807
Come on.

06:07.875 --> 06:09.876
Hey.

06:11.245 --> 06:13.646
I'm really hoping
you got something to tell me.

06:13.714 --> 06:15.281
I just got done interviewing
the park rangers,

06:15.349 --> 06:17.383
and none of them
saw anything.

06:17.451 --> 06:20.386
Something wrong? Have I got
something on my forehead?

06:20.454 --> 06:24.190
No... No, I just, uh...

06:30.264 --> 06:33.500
Lee, uh... these
people over here,

06:33.601 --> 06:35.835
you don't notice anything
strange about them, do you?

06:35.903 --> 06:36.836
I don't know.

06:36.904 --> 06:38.638
The reporters, I get.
The rest of them,

06:38.706 --> 06:40.507
I always wonder what
they do for a living,

06:40.574 --> 06:42.442
that they can just
stand around watching us...

06:42.510 --> 06:43.843
stand around.

06:43.911 --> 06:47.714
Yeah. I always wondered
about that, too.

06:47.781 --> 06:49.983
Name's Melinda Sully.

06:50.050 --> 06:53.453
According to her roommate, she
commuted to work on her bike.

06:53.521 --> 06:56.222
Used to cut through the park
if she was running late.

06:56.290 --> 06:57.757
Roommate begged Melinda
to stop using the park

06:57.825 --> 07:00.260
after the killings
started, but, uh,

07:00.327 --> 07:01.861
Melinda figured
all the murders

07:01.929 --> 07:04.130
seemed to be happening
first thing in the morning.

07:04.198 --> 07:05.665
Our best guess is that, uh,

07:05.733 --> 07:09.068
the Strangler assaulted her
last night, on her way home.

07:09.136 --> 07:10.737
The forensic team
find any evidence we can use?

07:10.804 --> 07:12.939
No, not a thing.

07:13.007 --> 07:15.341
Just like the first two victims.

07:15.409 --> 07:16.876
Guy's a clean freak.

07:18.145 --> 07:19.345
Okay, great.

07:19.413 --> 07:20.613
Okay.

07:20.681 --> 07:23.550
Just got off the
phone with the mayor.

07:23.617 --> 07:25.018
He wants you to know
that you have

07:25.085 --> 07:26.486
whatever you need
to catch this guy.

07:32.960 --> 07:34.661
You both have suns.

07:34.728 --> 07:36.296
You both match.

07:37.197 --> 07:38.765
Excuse me?

07:38.832 --> 07:41.467
Nothing.
Detective, may I
speak with you?

07:41.535 --> 07:43.503
I was just thinking.

07:47.207 --> 07:49.943
Excuse me, sir.
Do you know that man?

07:53.347 --> 07:54.747
Nope, haven't a clue.

07:54.815 --> 07:58.284
Guess there's only one way
to find out. Excuse me.

08:01.922 --> 08:02.855
Uh, that's okay.

08:02.923 --> 08:03.990
Thank you.

08:04.058 --> 08:05.858
Oh, thank... Hey, I'm so
sorry to bother you.

08:05.926 --> 08:07.961
I, um, I'm just kind of
anxious to talk to somebody

08:08.028 --> 08:09.128
involved in the
investigation.

08:09.196 --> 08:10.496
Well, my name's
Allison Dubois.

08:10.564 --> 08:11.731
I'm with the District
Attorney's office.

08:11.799 --> 08:12.765
Maybe I can help you.

08:12.833 --> 08:14.267
Great! I'm Gil Bureli.

08:14.335 --> 08:15.501
I'm, uh, I'm president of the

08:15.569 --> 08:17.470
local small business
association.

08:17.538 --> 08:19.806
The Centennial Park
Small Business Association.

08:19.873 --> 08:21.975
The thing is,

08:22.042 --> 08:25.478
this, uh, this man, who keeps
killing all these women?

08:25.546 --> 08:30.049
Um, the media keeps calling him
the Centennial Park Strangler.

08:30.117 --> 08:34.486
And, uh, we, as the Centennial
Park Small Business Association,

08:34.554 --> 08:36.222
we kinda, you know,

08:36.289 --> 08:38.191
we kinda got some concerns
about that, you know?

08:39.760 --> 08:42.128
So you don't like what
we're calling the murderer.

08:42.196 --> 08:44.364
Yeah. I know, I-I-I know
it sounds kinda callous.

08:44.431 --> 08:47.000
I know three women
have been killed,

08:47.067 --> 08:49.702
I know this is the last
thing on your mind,

08:49.770 --> 08:53.239
but honestly, it is,
it's really bad for business,

08:53.307 --> 08:55.742
and, you know, my colleagues
and I, we were wondering if...

08:55.809 --> 08:57.677
if there's a press
conference or something

08:57.745 --> 09:00.013
and if they can maybe
call him by a different name

09:00.080 --> 09:01.114
without Centennial Park in it.

09:01.181 --> 09:03.216
I mean, I got some ideas
I could tell you...

09:03.283 --> 09:06.853
Well, I can't promise you
anything, but I'll mention it.

09:06.920 --> 09:09.555
Oh, that is
awesome, awesome.

09:09.623 --> 09:11.658
Let me give you my card.
Thank you so much.

09:11.725 --> 09:13.693
It's got my name and my number
on it, if you know of anything.

09:13.761 --> 09:15.795
"Gilberto's.

09:15.863 --> 09:17.363
Come and eat your heart out."

09:17.431 --> 09:18.998
Yeah,
that's my restaurant.

09:19.066 --> 09:20.833
I'm cooking supper up there
every single night.

09:20.901 --> 09:22.402
Come on over.

09:22.469 --> 09:23.770
Anyways, uh...

09:23.837 --> 09:25.905
so, you know, if anything
comes up, just let me know.

09:25.973 --> 09:28.074
Okay. Thanks.
Thank you so much.

09:28.142 --> 09:29.776
Thanks.
Sure.

09:29.843 --> 09:31.511
<i>So I've read your report,</i>

09:31.578 --> 09:33.146
and I have to say,

09:33.213 --> 09:35.915
I-I can't make
hide nor hair of it.

09:35.983 --> 09:37.684
The client wanted to know

09:37.751 --> 09:40.086
if they could apply
a plasma-assisted

09:40.154 --> 09:42.321
Fischer-Tropsch process to
the mass production of Syngas.

09:42.389 --> 09:44.023
That's all they wanted to know.

09:44.091 --> 09:46.292
I've been through this thing
twice, and I can't figure out

09:46.360 --> 09:47.527
if the answer's yes or no.

09:47.594 --> 09:50.029
I know it's
inconclusive.

09:50.097 --> 09:51.164
The results were
inconclusive.

09:51.231 --> 09:53.433
I think Lydia and I just
need a little more time.

09:53.500 --> 09:55.101
We don't have
any more time, Dave.

09:55.169 --> 09:56.836
And I have a really
hard time understanding

09:56.904 --> 09:57.904
how two qualified engineers

09:57.971 --> 09:59.605
can spend the better
part of a month

09:59.673 --> 10:01.274
working on this thing
and not crack it.

10:01.341 --> 10:05.111
If you weren't making headway,
you should've come to me.

10:05.179 --> 10:06.512
What happened?

10:07.848 --> 10:10.516
I don't know, it
always seemed like

10:10.584 --> 10:13.453
the answer was right
around the corner.

10:14.922 --> 10:16.756
Lydia? You have
nothing to add?

10:18.492 --> 10:22.161
Well, e-mail me the document,
and I'll spend

10:22.229 --> 10:24.397
this afternoon and probably
the better part of this evening

10:24.465 --> 10:26.866
going through it,
and see if I can

10:26.934 --> 10:28.735
find a way to salvage
this thing.

10:28.802 --> 10:30.570
Okay. Thanks.

10:38.312 --> 10:39.412
Joe?

10:39.480 --> 10:40.646
Yeah?

10:41.682 --> 10:45.418
I-I wanted to apologize.

10:45.486 --> 10:50.256
The truth is, I really couldn't
focus during the project.

10:50.357 --> 10:52.358
Maybe I should've come to you,
talked to you about it.

10:52.426 --> 10:54.327
I-I really wasn't sure
what to do.

10:54.394 --> 10:56.429
I'm sorry, Lydia,
I don't understand

10:56.497 --> 10:57.830
what you're talking about.

11:02.903 --> 11:04.837
Dave.

11:04.905 --> 11:06.672
He just keeps coming onto me.

11:06.740 --> 11:08.741
I told him I wasn't
interested,

11:08.809 --> 11:11.844
I'm still telling him
I'm not interested,

11:11.912 --> 11:13.513
but the guy doesn't
want to hear it.

11:13.580 --> 11:18.518
It's pretty much impossible
for me to work with him.

11:18.585 --> 11:20.486
I'm sorry to burden
you with this,

11:20.554 --> 11:21.921
but you are my
direct supervisor.

11:21.989 --> 11:23.856
<i>She's dreaming.</i>

11:23.924 --> 11:25.358
The woman is out of her mind.

11:25.425 --> 11:27.627
Well, she's saying that she
can't work with you, Dave.

11:27.694 --> 11:29.328
Y-you know what this is.

11:29.396 --> 11:32.532
This is her setting me up
to take the fall

11:32.599 --> 11:34.534
on that report
you didn't like.

11:34.601 --> 11:37.403
I swear to you,
this is totally bogus.

11:37.471 --> 11:40.206
I mean, we worked late
a few times.

11:40.274 --> 11:43.609
I asked her if she
wanted to grab some dinner.

11:43.677 --> 11:45.478
Same way I'd ask you
if we worked late,

11:45.546 --> 11:46.979
"Do you want
to grab a bite?"

11:47.047 --> 11:49.115
I wasn't hitting on her.

11:49.183 --> 11:52.485
Okay. Well, I wasn't there, so I
don't know who said what to who.

11:52.553 --> 11:54.754
I'm just saying you're lucky
that she came to me with this,

11:54.822 --> 11:56.622
because if she felt like
she was being harassed,

11:56.690 --> 11:58.524
she could've gone straight
to Human Resources...

11:58.592 --> 12:01.794
HR? Come on.

12:01.862 --> 12:05.164
Look. I know you've got
a lot on your plate,

12:05.232 --> 12:08.334
I know we kinda dropped
the ball on that report,

12:08.402 --> 12:10.837
I didn't do anything
out of line,

12:10.904 --> 12:13.639
but if it'll make your life
easier, I'll apologize to Lydia.

12:13.707 --> 12:15.041
No, don't do that.

12:15.108 --> 12:18.244
Just steer clear of her
for a little while, okay?

12:18.312 --> 12:19.846
Well, I feel like
I gotta do something.

12:19.913 --> 12:22.548
Can I at least help you with
the mop-up on our report?

12:22.616 --> 12:25.051
Uh, no. That's okay.
I'll handle the report.

12:25.118 --> 12:26.786
Best thing you can do
for me right now

12:26.854 --> 12:28.254
is just not make this worse.

12:30.290 --> 12:31.490
Hey, Al, you in there?

12:31.558 --> 12:33.726
I'm back here!

12:33.794 --> 12:35.161
Girls are eating dinner.

12:35.229 --> 12:37.530
ALLISON
Yes!

12:37.598 --> 12:39.365
Yes! Yes!

12:39.433 --> 12:41.033
You have a star!

12:41.101 --> 12:43.169
We're a match! Yes.

12:43.237 --> 12:46.372
I have a star, you have a star,
we're a match.

12:46.440 --> 12:47.707
I beg your pardon?

12:47.774 --> 12:49.642
Well, ever since this morning,
I've been seeing

12:49.710 --> 12:51.477
these weird little symbols
over people's heads,

12:51.545 --> 12:53.813
and I didn't really
know what to make of it.

12:53.881 --> 12:57.149
And then I saw Lynn and Lee
standing next to each other,

12:57.217 --> 13:00.853
and they both had these little
sun icons over their heads,

13:00.921 --> 13:02.121
and they were a match.

13:02.189 --> 13:04.557
How lovely for them.

13:04.625 --> 13:07.126
And now... I see that we match.

13:07.194 --> 13:09.128
We have stars!

13:09.196 --> 13:13.232
I have a star,
you have a star.

13:13.300 --> 13:15.301
We have stars, we match.

13:22.542 --> 13:23.643
Are you okay?

13:23.710 --> 13:26.545
Yeah, this is
good news, right?

13:26.613 --> 13:28.381
Yeah, no, it's great,
it's exciting.

13:28.448 --> 13:30.116
You're seeing
love matches,

13:30.183 --> 13:33.119
Marie's dreaming about
people having sex.

13:33.186 --> 13:34.587
So I'm just wondering,

13:34.655 --> 13:36.856
hey, I'm just wondering if
maybe we should take a drive

13:36.924 --> 13:38.124
down to the hospital

13:38.191 --> 13:41.527
have the neurologist on
call take a look at you,

13:41.595 --> 13:44.196
see if he thinks this
is as much fun as you do.

13:44.264 --> 13:46.899
Honey, why?
Why would we do that?

13:46.967 --> 13:49.235
Well, we would do
that because, Al,

13:49.303 --> 13:52.438
last year you had a
stroke and a tumor.

13:52.506 --> 13:55.641
'Cause I just want to make sure
there's nothing wrong with you.

13:55.709 --> 13:56.776
WOMAN
Paging Dr. Bender.

13:56.843 --> 13:58.911
Paging Dr. Bender.
Come on.

13:58.979 --> 14:00.980
It's been two hours
since we got that CAT scan.

14:01.048 --> 14:03.649
When do you think we're going
to be able to see a doctor?

14:03.717 --> 14:06.786
Hey. Doctor's gonna walk in
in exactly...

14:06.853 --> 14:08.821
Oh, wait a second, you're
the psychic in the family.

14:08.889 --> 14:10.556
Why don't you tell me when the
doctor's going to get here?

14:10.624 --> 14:14.660
What are you so angry
and impatient about?

14:14.728 --> 14:15.995
Hmm?

14:16.063 --> 14:19.398
Just trying to make sure
you're okay, okay?

14:19.466 --> 14:21.000
Maybe just tell yourself
you're doing it for me.

14:24.137 --> 14:25.771
I'm sorry to make you wait,
Mrs. Dubois.

14:25.839 --> 14:28.908
Just now got the results
of your test.

14:28.976 --> 14:30.576
I'm Doctor Bennette,

14:30.644 --> 14:33.212
and I'm happy to say that
there's nothing wrong with you.

14:33.280 --> 14:35.781
Nothing at all abnormal
in your scan.

14:35.849 --> 14:37.917
If these, uh, if these
hallucinations persist,

14:37.985 --> 14:39.585
we can take another look,

14:39.653 --> 14:41.253
but for tonight,
based on what I see,

14:41.321 --> 14:43.189
you're fine.
You can go home.

14:43.256 --> 14:44.590
All right. Well,
thank you, thank you.

14:44.658 --> 14:45.958
Sorry to bring you out here
in the middle of the night.

14:46.026 --> 14:47.093
Oh, no problem.

14:47.160 --> 14:49.228
Now, do you have any questions
for me?

14:49.296 --> 14:51.797
You know, I just have one.

14:51.865 --> 14:53.733
Are you seeing someone?

15:00.695 --> 15:03.497
Okay, so now
you're Cupid?

15:03.565 --> 15:04.832
Stop.

15:04.899 --> 15:05.966
I'm just saying.

15:06.034 --> 15:07.501
With everything
that's been going on,

15:07.569 --> 15:09.570
with everything
that I've been seeing?

15:09.637 --> 15:11.372
I think something's
trying to tell me

15:11.439 --> 15:12.639
that this man

15:12.707 --> 15:14.541
and this woman

15:14.609 --> 15:16.643
belong together.

15:16.711 --> 15:18.045
That's all.

15:18.113 --> 15:19.780
Al, you don't know
either of these people.

15:19.848 --> 15:21.048
Why are you
getting involved?

15:21.116 --> 15:22.583
Why are you being
such a grump?

15:22.650 --> 15:24.251
Come on, babe,
this is nice.

15:24.319 --> 15:25.252
This is fun.

15:25.320 --> 15:26.754
Most of the stuff
that I see

15:26.821 --> 15:29.523
is so full of darkness
and death and...

15:29.591 --> 15:31.058
You know what? This is a chance

15:31.126 --> 15:33.026
to do something positive.

15:33.094 --> 15:37.097
This is a chance to make
two people very happy.

15:37.165 --> 15:38.999
Oh, my God, you're not actually
calling one of them, are you?

15:39.067 --> 15:40.200
Shh, grumpy man!

15:40.268 --> 15:42.736
Come on,
I have a match to make.

15:42.804 --> 15:45.305
Hi. Hello. Dr. Bennette.

15:45.373 --> 15:46.573
This is Allison Dubois.

15:46.641 --> 15:48.942
Um, you just treated me,
it's Tuesday night.

15:49.010 --> 15:51.278
Uh, I just really
want to thank you

15:51.346 --> 15:52.546
for coming down to the hospital,

15:52.614 --> 15:56.950
and, uh,
for being so reassuring.

15:57.018 --> 15:59.153
And you know, there was
something about you

15:59.220 --> 16:01.422
that I just thought we could be
great friends.

16:01.489 --> 16:04.024
And I know this great little
Italian restaurant.

16:04.092 --> 16:05.893
So, give me a call.

16:05.960 --> 16:10.297
Um, 602-555-0147 if you're free.

16:50.338 --> 16:51.672
MAN
Mr. Dubois?

16:51.739 --> 16:52.673
What is it, Carter?

16:52.740 --> 16:54.508
I have to get this report out.

16:54.576 --> 16:56.109
I know, you didn't
want to be disturbed,

16:56.177 --> 16:59.112
but I have Mr. Burroughs
on the line?

17:01.115 --> 17:03.116
I told her I was sorry.
Is that a crime?

17:03.184 --> 17:05.085
I thought we agreed you weren't
going to talk to her at all.

17:05.153 --> 17:06.319
No. No,
we never said that.

17:06.387 --> 17:07.721
You never said that.
Yes, we did.

17:07.789 --> 17:09.289
Hold on a second.
You said
not to make it worse.

17:09.357 --> 17:10.457
I told you to stay clear of
her for a few days.
I apologized.

17:10.525 --> 17:11.625
How could that
make it worse?

17:11.693 --> 17:13.227
I don't know, David.
You tell me.

17:13.294 --> 17:14.962
The company's being sued,
all right?

17:15.029 --> 17:17.297
She's suing us. Apparently over
something that you said.

17:17.365 --> 17:21.068
Look, all I said to her
is that we had spoken,

17:21.135 --> 17:22.869
and that I was sorry.

17:22.936 --> 17:24.505
And that... it was a real shame.

17:24.571 --> 17:25.606
What's a real shame?

17:25.673 --> 17:27.773
That apparently
we can't have dinner

17:27.842 --> 17:30.577
because we work together,
and that maybe if we're lucky,

17:30.645 --> 17:33.046
one of us will get fired so it
won't be a problem anymore.

17:33.114 --> 17:34.581
That last part was a joke.

17:34.649 --> 17:36.750
Hold on a second, you said
maybe one of you will get fired?

17:36.818 --> 17:38.685
You outrank her.

17:38.753 --> 17:40.754
You've worked on this project
longer than her.

17:40.822 --> 17:43.190
Don't you see how that could
be construed as a threat?

17:43.258 --> 17:46.293
Joe... how am I supposed
to know she can't take a joke?

17:46.361 --> 17:47.728
You weren't supposed to be
talking to her

17:47.795 --> 17:49.229
in the first place!

17:50.665 --> 17:51.665
You know what? Go home!

17:51.733 --> 17:52.666
What?

17:52.734 --> 17:54.902
Come on, Joe, this ridicu...

17:54.969 --> 17:56.803
The company's in litigation
because of you.

17:56.871 --> 17:58.939
I can't trust you to stay
away from this woman.

17:59.007 --> 18:00.073
I don't have a choice.

18:00.141 --> 18:02.976
You're suspended
until further notice.

18:06.281 --> 18:07.347
Allison. Hi.

18:07.415 --> 18:08.549
I'm sorry I'm late.

18:08.616 --> 18:09.750
Doctor.

18:09.817 --> 18:12.085
Judy. It's a cozy place.

18:12.153 --> 18:13.754
Oh, I am so glad you made it,

18:13.821 --> 18:16.223
I am so glad you found it.
Oh, hey.

18:16.291 --> 18:19.126
I don't know that I've
ever had a patient call me

18:19.193 --> 18:21.962
and ask me to lunch
to thank me before.

18:22.030 --> 18:24.031
Certainly never a
patient who's, um,

18:24.098 --> 18:25.799
how do you think
of yourself?

18:25.867 --> 18:28.769
As famous?
Or notorious?

18:28.836 --> 18:31.638
I don't think I'm notorious.

18:31.706 --> 18:34.007
I-I don't even really think
I'm famous.

18:34.075 --> 18:35.442
I just think I'm me.

18:35.510 --> 18:38.378
I don't know.
I find people like you--

18:38.446 --> 18:41.615
the idea of people like you--
fascinating.

18:41.683 --> 18:44.184
You two need a few more minutes?

18:44.252 --> 18:47.120
Um, I don't think we had
a chance to look, yet.

18:47.188 --> 18:48.255
Take your time.

18:48.323 --> 18:50.290
Oh, wait.
There is one thing.

18:50.358 --> 18:52.459
The chef here's the owner,
isn't he?

18:52.527 --> 18:55.162
I think I met him the other day.
I'd love to say hello.

18:55.229 --> 18:56.964
Yeah, well, he's usually
back there cooking,

18:57.031 --> 18:59.299
but I'm not even sure
he's coming in today.

18:59.367 --> 19:01.268
His assistant's manning
the kitchen right now.

19:01.336 --> 19:04.671
Can I give him a
message for you?

19:04.739 --> 19:08.208
Mm, no. I guess we just need
a second here.

19:08.276 --> 19:09.676
I'll stop back.

19:14.015 --> 19:19.286
So I-I, uh, have to ask...

19:19.354 --> 19:22.623
How does it work? I mean...

19:22.690 --> 19:26.793
Take me. You don't even
know me, and we...

19:26.861 --> 19:31.632
But do you just meet someone
like me and see things, or...?

19:31.699 --> 19:35.636
You know, it's different
for everyone.

19:35.703 --> 19:39.906
There's really no rules,
nothing that you can count on.

19:39.974 --> 19:43.243
Although I have to say, I had a
very strong instinct about you,

19:43.311 --> 19:44.978
when you came into the hospital
last night.

19:45.046 --> 19:47.347
What, oh, good news? Bad news?

19:47.415 --> 19:49.716
It's good news.

19:49.784 --> 19:51.084
I mean, I think,

19:51.152 --> 19:53.320
although I really don't know
your situation.

19:53.388 --> 19:55.055
My situation...

19:55.123 --> 19:58.492
Well, it was...

19:58.559 --> 20:00.661
it was kind of
a romantic instinct.

20:00.728 --> 20:03.397
I really sensed that you were
going to meet this man,

20:03.464 --> 20:05.399
and he was going to be
the right man for you,

20:05.466 --> 20:07.234
and it was going to happen
so fast...

20:07.301 --> 20:12.005
But, I mean, I don't know,
you could have a husband

20:12.073 --> 20:15.542
who you love, and this could be
a terrible mistake...

20:15.610 --> 20:18.245
Oh, I have a fabulous condo

20:18.312 --> 20:20.647
and a cat who meows
when I come home at night

20:20.715 --> 20:22.949
and a car I treat
as if it's my child.

20:23.017 --> 20:24.751
No. No...

20:24.819 --> 20:28.021
Where is he? When is
all this gonna happen?

20:28.089 --> 20:30.223
You don't even have to
buy me lunch, now,

20:30.291 --> 20:32.059
this is so much better.

20:33.294 --> 20:34.828
Uh, well, I don't know,
you know?

20:34.896 --> 20:36.196
I really thought it was
going to happen today,

20:36.264 --> 20:39.332
but now I'm thinking...

20:39.400 --> 20:42.536
Uh, you know what?

20:42.603 --> 20:44.404
Just forget what I said.

20:44.472 --> 20:46.139
I don't know
what I'm talking about.

20:46.207 --> 20:48.241
Just... order something.
Order something expensive.

20:48.309 --> 20:49.976
Order two things.

20:50.044 --> 20:51.978
Order something for your cat!

20:54.148 --> 20:55.649
That was fun.
And delicious.

20:55.717 --> 20:58.085
Again, thank you so much
for coming in last night.

20:58.152 --> 20:59.786
And please just forget
everything I said in there.

20:59.854 --> 21:00.987
Not on your life.

21:01.055 --> 21:02.589
When I-when I meet
him, I'll call you.

21:02.657 --> 21:04.658
Bye.

21:04.726 --> 21:05.859
Bye.

21:10.698 --> 21:11.631
Hey, Lee.

21:11.699 --> 21:12.999
I just wanted you to know

21:13.067 --> 21:15.502
I just got back from sorting
through piles of doggy-doo

21:15.570 --> 21:16.803
at Centennial Park.

21:16.871 --> 21:17.838
Tell me you found something.

21:19.240 --> 21:21.274
That wire was right where
you said it'd be.

21:21.342 --> 21:23.276
Lab says the blood on the wire's
Melinda Sully's.

21:23.344 --> 21:25.045
But they also found
some fingerprints on the gloves

21:25.113 --> 21:27.347
that were in the bag,

21:27.415 --> 21:29.816
and on the bag itself.

21:29.884 --> 21:31.384
We think those belong
to the Strangler.

21:31.452 --> 21:32.719
That's great.

21:32.787 --> 21:34.788
Well, they don't match anything
we have on file

21:34.856 --> 21:37.023
but still, it's a hell of a lot
more than we had this morning.

21:38.960 --> 21:41.795
What was that? You okay?

21:41.863 --> 21:43.997
Uh, yeah. No, I'm fine, it's
just a little fender-bender.

21:44.065 --> 21:45.532
Listen, Lee, I've gotta go.

21:47.735 --> 21:49.169
Oh, man, I am so sorry.

21:49.237 --> 21:50.403
Are you all right?

21:50.471 --> 21:51.872
Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm fine.

21:51.939 --> 21:53.707
I shouldn't have
backed up so fast.

21:53.775 --> 21:55.108
Ay, ay...

21:55.176 --> 21:57.210
Well, it doesn't
look that bad.

21:57.278 --> 21:59.312
You know, we should probably
exchange information

21:59.380 --> 22:00.647
for insurance purposes.
Oh, right.

22:00.715 --> 22:02.916
You know what? This is my fault.
I was going way too fast.

22:02.984 --> 22:04.951
I... God, I was late for work.
I don't know why

22:05.019 --> 22:06.853
I think they can't do
the lunch rush without me.

22:06.921 --> 22:08.855
You work here?

22:08.923 --> 22:10.690
Yeah, I'm the owner.

22:10.758 --> 22:12.492
You know what?

22:12.560 --> 22:15.629
Would you want to... would you
want to come for dinner tonight?

22:15.696 --> 22:17.330
Excuse me?

22:17.398 --> 22:18.799
I mean, I hit your car.

22:18.866 --> 22:21.935
I mean, the least I can do
is cook you a nice dinner.

22:22.003 --> 22:25.472
You can bring a friend, you
can bring your family, uh...

22:25.540 --> 22:28.175
God, bring a bunch of strangers,
if you want.

22:34.282 --> 22:36.783
I'm ready to accept
your apology anytime now.

22:36.851 --> 22:38.151
Congratulations.
Keep it.

22:38.219 --> 22:43.023
You stuck to your guns and
created a car accident.

22:43.090 --> 22:45.425
They liked each other.

22:45.493 --> 22:49.196
They had chemistry. I saw it.

22:49.263 --> 22:51.398
Yoo-hoo,
are you listening to me?

22:51.465 --> 22:53.233
Hey, you know,
you play your cards right,

22:53.301 --> 22:55.502
I might have one match left
in me tonight.

22:55.570 --> 22:58.505
What the hell?
According to this,

22:58.573 --> 23:02.042
Lydia is going to name me
as a party in her suit.

23:02.109 --> 23:04.845
It says I fostered a
hostile work environment

23:04.912 --> 23:07.814
by failing to take the
proper corrective measures.

23:07.882 --> 23:09.716
Huh?
What?

23:09.784 --> 23:11.117
It's all right here.

23:11.185 --> 23:13.353
These are the papers she served
the company this afternoon.

23:13.421 --> 23:14.821
I gotta send an e-mail.

23:14.889 --> 23:17.657
I gotta respond to this.
Well, how are you going
to respond?

23:17.725 --> 23:21.795
I-I don't know. I gotta let them
know that... I'll hire a lawyer

23:21.863 --> 23:23.496
or I'll file a countersuit

23:23.564 --> 23:25.932
or whatever it takes to keep my
name out of this.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.735
I mean, these are lies.
This woman's playing dirty.

23:28.803 --> 23:31.538
I got to show her that if-if
she's gonna be coming after me,

23:31.606 --> 23:33.373
I'm gonna go after her.

23:33.441 --> 23:36.109
Go... you go ahead,
just go to sleep.

23:43.918 --> 23:47.053
I-I just wanted you to know
I never do things like this.

23:47.121 --> 23:49.756
Oh, okay.

23:49.824 --> 23:52.025
Eat till I'm stuffed.

23:52.093 --> 23:54.194
Drink till I'm silly.

23:54.262 --> 23:58.064
Stay out late
with a guy I just met.

23:58.132 --> 24:00.433
I'm a doctor; I'm not
an impulsive person.

24:00.501 --> 24:02.135
Oh, okay.

24:02.203 --> 24:06.306
So, why me? Why tonight?

24:06.374 --> 24:09.042
I don't know.
You seem nice.

24:09.110 --> 24:10.810
Oh, okay.

24:10.878 --> 24:12.045
And you're cute.

24:12.113 --> 24:14.981
Oh, thank you very much.

24:15.049 --> 24:18.218
Someone told me to be on the
lookout for a guy like you.

24:18.286 --> 24:21.855
Really? Wow, that's funny.

24:21.923 --> 24:24.257
'Cause, um...

24:24.325 --> 24:27.727
I've always been on the
lookout for someone like you.

24:31.132 --> 24:33.233
Do you want some more wine?

24:33.301 --> 24:35.402
Uh, yeah.

24:35.469 --> 24:37.103
Cool.

24:41.375 --> 24:43.076
It's so beautiful.

24:43.144 --> 24:46.246
I never knew
about this spot.

24:46.314 --> 24:48.748
Oh, oh!

24:48.816 --> 24:50.684
I love, love, love it here.

24:50.751 --> 24:54.187
It's like my own private little
oasis, my own private

24:54.255 --> 24:55.322
little piece of heaven.

24:57.692 --> 24:58.992
It's nice, right?

24:59.060 --> 25:02.495
It's like there's nobody
else in the world.

25:08.235 --> 25:09.803
Hello?

25:09.870 --> 25:11.137
It's Lee.

25:11.205 --> 25:14.040
Sorry to wake you, but I thought
you'd want to know.

25:14.108 --> 25:17.310
The Strangler killed another
woman last night.

25:17.378 --> 25:19.879
Dr. Judith...
Dr. Judy Bennett.

25:29.588 --> 25:31.989
You get a hold of anyone?

25:32.057 --> 25:33.958
Davalos.

25:34.026 --> 25:38.029
I talked to Davalos. I told
him everything that I know.

25:39.931 --> 25:43.467
So, that's it. Right?

25:43.535 --> 25:46.370
You told him who
the killer is,

25:46.438 --> 25:50.241
gave him his name,
where he works?

25:50.309 --> 25:52.043
Yeah.

25:57.282 --> 25:58.215
Allison...

25:58.283 --> 26:01.786
I don't understand.

26:03.555 --> 26:06.057
I... I thought that
they were a match.

26:06.124 --> 26:09.193
I thought that they were
supposed to be together.

26:11.296 --> 26:14.031
She was so nice
at the hospital.

26:14.099 --> 26:17.635
She was so nice at lunch,
and she trusted me.

26:17.703 --> 26:20.037
And I introduced her
to a killer.

26:20.105 --> 26:22.707
No, you didn't actually
introduce her.

26:22.774 --> 26:24.875
Yes, I did,
I brought them together.

26:24.976 --> 26:27.745
I thought that's what
I was supposed to do.

26:29.881 --> 26:33.250
I thought that's what
I was supposed to do.

26:40.425 --> 26:41.726
Hey, Joe.

26:41.793 --> 26:43.794
Hi.

26:43.862 --> 26:45.563
So, what's next?

26:45.630 --> 26:47.231
I'm ready to work.

26:47.299 --> 26:49.800
You know, ever since
I told you about David,

26:49.868 --> 26:52.603
you haven't thrown
any new projects my way.

26:52.671 --> 26:55.272
I'm just trying to
be smart about it.

26:55.340 --> 26:56.774
Trying to find
the right thing.

26:57.843 --> 26:59.777
Really?

26:59.845 --> 27:01.712
How hard is it to look?

27:01.780 --> 27:04.148
You know what, Lydia?
With everything that's going on,

27:04.216 --> 27:05.983
I think it's probably
not a good idea

27:06.051 --> 27:08.519
for us to talk
without attorneys present.

27:08.587 --> 27:11.122
So, I'll see you inside.

27:13.191 --> 27:16.394
You were... you were
busy last night, huh?

27:16.461 --> 27:18.929
I got a call from my attorney
first thing this morning.

27:18.997 --> 27:20.598
He said your attorney
e-mailed him,

27:20.665 --> 27:22.700
something about reserving your
right to file a countersuit.

27:22.768 --> 27:24.769
Yeah, I really don't want
to discuss this here.

27:24.836 --> 27:27.605
Well, I just want you
to know I don't think
that's a good idea.

27:27.672 --> 27:30.074
It's just so close
to being over.

27:30.142 --> 27:31.842
The company's already
talking settlement.

27:31.910 --> 27:33.110
Yeah, well, the company's

27:33.178 --> 27:35.112
not the only party
named in the lawsuit,

27:35.180 --> 27:37.114
so they gotta do
what they gotta do

27:37.182 --> 27:39.784
and I gotta do
what I gotta do.

27:39.851 --> 27:41.118
Ow.

27:42.854 --> 27:46.056
That really hurts.

27:46.124 --> 27:48.959
Yeah, I think that's definitely
gonna leave a mark, don't you?

27:49.027 --> 27:50.795
What are you doing?

27:50.862 --> 27:52.062
This is where you grabbed me

27:52.130 --> 27:54.265
when I told you I wouldn't drop
my lawsuit.

27:54.332 --> 27:57.234
You asked me to
meet you here.

27:57.302 --> 28:00.704
I thought that was weird,
but you said it was important.

28:00.772 --> 28:03.307
You said we needed to talk.

28:03.375 --> 28:05.075
Remember?

28:05.143 --> 28:06.877
It's good timing, actually,
'cause I was

28:06.945 --> 28:08.612
just about to go to my
attorney's office.

28:08.680 --> 28:11.749
I'm sure he'll be
very interested in
photographing my injury.

28:11.817 --> 28:13.184
That's not gonna work.

28:13.251 --> 28:17.621
Oh, I think it's gonna
work magnificently.

28:17.689 --> 28:18.789
Joe, come on.

28:18.857 --> 28:22.193
Look, I just want
things to go smoothly.

28:22.260 --> 28:24.228
And forget your
countersuit.

28:24.296 --> 28:25.796
I'm not coming
after you, anyway.

28:25.864 --> 28:27.598
I only named you

28:27.666 --> 28:29.600
because you're my
direct supervisor

28:29.668 --> 28:32.636
and I needed to turn the
heat up on the company.

28:32.704 --> 28:35.039
But I don't... I
don't want your money.

28:35.106 --> 28:37.741
I just want a settlement.

28:39.211 --> 28:43.914
So, why don't you just sit back,
let the law take its course?

28:45.617 --> 28:48.185
This'll all be over
before you know it.

28:55.760 --> 28:58.095
I can't believe you're just
going to let him go.

28:58.163 --> 28:59.597
We have no choice.

28:59.664 --> 29:01.165
Forensics just got done
comparing his prints

29:01.233 --> 29:03.067
to the prints on the baggie
and the glove

29:03.134 --> 29:04.568
we found near Melinda's body.

29:04.636 --> 29:07.505
There is no match.
It's not even close.

29:07.572 --> 29:09.006
No, he is the Strangler.

29:09.074 --> 29:11.308
I saw him kill
Judy Bennett.

29:11.376 --> 29:13.244
I-I saw them together.

29:13.311 --> 29:15.446
Bureli admits to meeting
Dr. Bennett yesterday.

29:15.514 --> 29:17.515
He described the same car
accident you did.

29:17.582 --> 29:20.084
He even admits to serving her
a free meal at his restaurant

29:20.151 --> 29:21.619
yesterday evening.

29:21.686 --> 29:24.488
But according to Bureli,
that's as far as it went.

29:24.556 --> 29:25.756
His employees confirm

29:25.824 --> 29:28.025
that he left work alone
at the end of the night.

29:28.093 --> 29:29.293
Nothing at all to indicate

29:29.361 --> 29:31.195
that they were together
when Dr. Bennett was killed.

29:31.263 --> 29:32.796
But they were,
and he killed her.

29:32.864 --> 29:34.098
I know you believe that,

29:34.165 --> 29:35.799
but there's simply
no evidence to support it.

29:35.867 --> 29:39.970
We've searched the victim's car,
we searched Bureli's apartment.

29:40.038 --> 29:42.172
I can't hold the
man any longer.

29:44.042 --> 29:45.509
Let him go!

29:50.382 --> 29:51.615
Don't look so defeated.

29:51.683 --> 29:53.851
Because of you we have
the Strangler's prints.

29:53.919 --> 29:56.554
The fact that they're
not Gil Bureli's...

29:56.621 --> 29:59.423
But we'll find him, you
know we'll find him.

30:02.193 --> 30:05.095
Well, look at it this way.

30:05.196 --> 30:08.399
You thought you'd introduced her
to her killer, but it turns out

30:08.466 --> 30:11.101
you didn't, so that's got
to be some relief, right?

30:11.169 --> 30:13.470
She's still dead.
Doesn't help me make sense

30:13.538 --> 30:16.574
of the fact
that I saw him kill her.

30:16.641 --> 30:18.642
You know, there was nothing
ambiguous about it.

30:18.710 --> 30:20.177
There was nothing coded
or veiled.

30:20.245 --> 30:24.648
I just don't know how I could
have been so wrong.

30:24.716 --> 30:26.984
Daddy, remember those grown-ups

30:27.052 --> 30:30.487
in their underpants I told you
about at the hotel?

30:30.555 --> 30:32.790
Wow, do I feel left out.

30:32.857 --> 30:36.627
Uh, oh, yes, yes, sweetie,
what about them?

30:36.695 --> 30:40.397
Why were their pictures
on the kitchen table?

30:49.341 --> 30:50.474
These are the two people

30:50.542 --> 30:53.143
that you saw on the bed together
in the hotel?

30:53.211 --> 30:56.213
Mm-hmm. I had another
dream about them tonight,

30:56.281 --> 30:59.850
and they were doing it
again in the exact same spot.

30:59.918 --> 31:02.286
Oh, I think you're wrong, honey.

31:02.354 --> 31:05.022
I know these people;
I work with them.

31:05.090 --> 31:06.991
They don't like
each other very much.

31:07.058 --> 31:08.993
I don't think they'd play
on a bed together.

31:09.060 --> 31:10.227
But they do.

31:10.295 --> 31:12.529
They do it at the
Shangri-La Hotel,

31:12.597 --> 31:15.532
and I seen it
two times now.

32:02.057 --> 32:04.258
So, what you're telling me
is that Dr. Bennett

32:04.317 --> 32:06.952
is both a victim of the
Centennial Park Strangler

32:07.020 --> 32:09.388
and the Strangler herself?

32:10.637 --> 32:12.104
I don't know what
I'm telling you;

32:12.172 --> 32:13.605
I'm just telling you
what I dreamt.

32:13.673 --> 32:15.741
Dr. Bennett murdered
Melinda Sully.

32:15.808 --> 32:19.578
I'm... dubious.

32:19.646 --> 32:21.246
But it's easy
enough to check.

32:21.314 --> 32:23.382
We can take fingerprints
off the doctor's corpse

32:23.449 --> 32:25.984
and compare them to the ones
we took off the plastic bag

32:26.052 --> 32:27.419
and gloves we found.

32:27.487 --> 32:30.756
But now let's talk about
the elephant in the room.

32:30.823 --> 32:32.925
Putting aside the question
of why a neurologist

32:32.992 --> 32:34.993
would strangle a women
to death with piano wire,

32:35.061 --> 32:38.230
there's a small matter of
Dr. Bennett's murder, because

32:38.298 --> 32:41.633
I think we can both agree
she didn't strangle herself.

32:43.469 --> 32:45.270
Maybe there's more than one.

32:45.371 --> 32:47.406
Sorry. More than one what?

32:47.473 --> 32:50.142
More than one Strangler.

32:57.550 --> 32:58.917
Mr. Bureli.

32:58.985 --> 33:01.687
It's my friend at city hall.

33:01.754 --> 33:05.390
You know, when I asked you
to ask the people you work with

33:05.458 --> 33:08.060
to call the Centennial Park
Strangler another name,

33:08.127 --> 33:10.929
Gil Bureli wasn't really
the name I had in mind.

33:10.997 --> 33:13.865
We solved the stranglings--
at least one of them, anyway.

33:16.035 --> 33:18.270
We found a murder weapon
and some fingerprints

33:18.338 --> 33:20.839
near the body of Melinda Sully,
the third victim.

33:20.907 --> 33:23.542
Turns out the fingerprints
belong to Dr. Judy Bennette.

33:25.345 --> 33:26.778
What?

33:26.846 --> 33:29.147
Wait a second. The lady
that was here the other night?

33:29.215 --> 33:30.315
I-I thought she was...

33:30.383 --> 33:32.918
Killed by the Strangler herself?
Yeah. I know.

33:32.986 --> 33:34.653
Doesn't make much sense,
does it?

33:34.721 --> 33:36.655
But we've been doing
a little research

33:36.723 --> 33:38.490
into Dr. Bennette--
where she was

33:38.558 --> 33:39.925
the night
of the first two killings--

33:39.993 --> 33:41.793
and it turns out
that Dr. Bennette was speaking

33:41.861 --> 33:43.695
at a medical conference
in Denver the first night,

33:43.763 --> 33:45.264
and the second night,
she was staying

33:45.331 --> 33:46.598
with her sister in Santa Fe,

33:46.666 --> 33:48.567
so clearly,
she didn't kill these two women.

33:48.635 --> 33:50.502
And obviously,
she didn't strangle herself,

33:50.570 --> 33:52.204
so we're pursuing this theory

33:52.272 --> 33:54.106
that Dr. Bennette
killed Melinda Sully,

33:54.173 --> 33:55.574
and Melinda Sully alone,

33:55.642 --> 33:57.075
and made it look like the work

33:57.143 --> 33:58.677
of the Centennial Park
Strangler.

33:58.745 --> 34:01.079
Now, why she
wanted Melinda dead,

34:01.147 --> 34:03.415
we're not sure,
but we'll figure it out.

34:03.483 --> 34:06.818
Right now, we're focusing on
catching the actual Strangler,

34:06.886 --> 34:08.587
who we both know is you.

34:08.655 --> 34:10.589
Oh, God.

34:10.657 --> 34:12.757
Okay, this is...
this is ridiculous.

34:12.824 --> 34:15.427
You people held me
for eight hours yesterday,

34:15.495 --> 34:16.995
and you didn't even charge me.

34:17.063 --> 34:19.097
You can't just keep accusing me
of this crime.

34:19.165 --> 34:20.831
Do you know
what this is costing me?

34:20.900 --> 34:23.235
My face was all over
the news last night.

34:23.303 --> 34:26.038
People were just getting up and
walking out of my restaurant.

34:28.308 --> 34:31.243
Oh, come on!

34:32.645 --> 34:34.045
Excuse me. Excuse me.

34:34.112 --> 34:35.480
Are you seriously
giving me a ticket?

34:35.547 --> 34:37.549
My wheels are like two inches
over the line here.

34:37.617 --> 34:39.083
That's two inches too many, sir.

34:39.152 --> 34:41.353
Oh, this is great.
This is great.

34:41.420 --> 34:42.987
It's not enough that
the City of Phoenix

34:43.056 --> 34:44.723
has completely destroyed
my livelihood.

34:44.791 --> 34:46.024
You're going to give me
another ticket

34:46.092 --> 34:47.559
for parking in front
of my own restaurant?

35:06.145 --> 35:07.279
David.

35:07.347 --> 35:11.149
Hey, I got an e-mail
you wanted to see me.

35:11.217 --> 35:14.319
Does this mean
I'm not suspended anymore?

35:16.356 --> 35:18.557
Hey.

35:18.624 --> 35:19.758
Hi.

35:19.826 --> 35:22.494
I, uh, I got
your e-mail.

35:22.562 --> 35:23.829
What's he doing here?

35:23.896 --> 35:26.565
Well, I want to have
a conversation with you both.

35:26.632 --> 35:28.433
Well, I don't think I feel
comfortable with that.

35:28.501 --> 35:29.768
Well, get comfortable.

35:29.836 --> 35:32.838
You still work for me,
so come on in and have a seat.

35:37.910 --> 35:39.845
Okay.

35:39.912 --> 35:41.313
Now,

35:41.381 --> 35:44.516
I think we need to put
this lawsuit behind us.

35:44.584 --> 35:47.319
I think we need to take this
out of the legal realm

35:47.387 --> 35:49.154
and deal with it ourselves.

35:49.222 --> 35:52.057
No, we're not supposed
to discuss the lawsuit

35:52.125 --> 35:53.792
with each other
and you know that.

35:53.860 --> 35:56.261
I don't know that.

35:56.329 --> 35:59.364
Come on, we're all thoughtful,
smart people.

35:59.432 --> 36:01.633
We're the people to whom
all this actually happened,

36:01.701 --> 36:03.235
not the lawyers,

36:03.302 --> 36:08.006
so I think the three of us
need to go away,

36:08.074 --> 36:11.343
check into a hotel
for a day, a week,

36:11.411 --> 36:13.845
as long as it takes
to work this out.

36:18.618 --> 36:20.552
What's this?

36:20.620 --> 36:23.889
That's the place
I think we ought to go.

36:25.291 --> 36:26.525
That's where you want to go?

36:26.592 --> 36:29.227
The Shangri-La Hotel.

36:30.863 --> 36:33.398
You know
the Shangri-La Hotel, right?

36:35.034 --> 36:36.301
No?

36:36.369 --> 36:38.270
Oh, it's a lovely little
out-of-the-way place.

36:38.337 --> 36:40.505
It's perfect for a couple
who wants to file

36:40.573 --> 36:42.240
a fraudulent
sexual harassment suit

36:42.308 --> 36:43.875
against the company
they work for

36:43.943 --> 36:46.211
but don't want
to stop sleeping together.

36:46.279 --> 36:49.247
What are you accusing me of?

36:49.315 --> 36:51.049
You're just determined
to make this worse

36:51.117 --> 36:52.584
for yourself and the company,
aren't you?

36:52.652 --> 36:54.019
You're telling me
you and Dave here

36:54.086 --> 36:55.687
have never been
to the Shangri-La?

36:57.089 --> 36:58.490
'Cause I drove
out there this morning,

36:58.558 --> 37:00.559
I showed your pictures around,
and all the staff said

37:00.626 --> 37:03.528
to say hi.

37:03.596 --> 37:06.198
They have security cameras
in the check-in area.

37:06.265 --> 37:08.700
The attorneys
at Burroughs-Strauss

37:08.768 --> 37:10.802
are looking
at the tapes right now.

37:12.839 --> 37:15.540
So...

37:15.608 --> 37:18.510
Dave and Lydia...

37:18.578 --> 37:21.012
what do you think is going
to happen to this lawsuit

37:21.080 --> 37:22.948
once we find footage
of the two of you

37:23.015 --> 37:25.784
checking into a hotel together?

37:25.852 --> 37:28.620
I believe the technical term
for what you two

37:28.688 --> 37:31.089
were engaged in
is "fraud."

37:31.157 --> 37:34.960
So I want your resignations
on my desk within an hour,

37:35.027 --> 37:39.030
and then the two of you
can go home, sit back,

37:39.098 --> 37:41.666
and wait for the law
to take its course.

37:45.938 --> 37:49.875
Honey, come on,
you were right by the phone.

37:49.942 --> 37:50.942
Hello.

37:51.010 --> 37:52.444
Okay, so I did like you said.

37:52.512 --> 37:54.379
I pulled up
Gil Bureli's DMV file,

37:54.447 --> 37:56.481
and it turns out you were right.

37:56.549 --> 37:59.618
He does have quite a few
unpaid parking tickets.

37:59.685 --> 38:01.920
He owes the city of Phoenix
about 800 bucks,

38:01.988 --> 38:03.121
and it gets better.

38:03.189 --> 38:05.690
Turns out Bureli spends
his weekends in Sonoma

38:05.758 --> 38:07.492
and he owes their
department of transportation

38:07.560 --> 38:09.261
three times what he owes us,

38:09.328 --> 38:11.596
and he ignored a summons
to show up in traffic court.

38:11.664 --> 38:14.199
Long story short: there's
a warrant out for his arrest.

38:14.267 --> 38:16.635
A judge sentenced him
in absentia.

38:16.702 --> 38:18.236
Oh, that's great.

38:18.304 --> 38:19.638
He's going to jail?

38:19.705 --> 38:21.840
Yeah, we just picked him up.

38:21.908 --> 38:24.309
He's going to be a guest
of the Sonoma prison system

38:24.377 --> 38:27.112
for five to seven whole days.

38:27.179 --> 38:30.181
One of their deputies is driving
down to get him as we speak.

38:30.249 --> 38:31.816
What, a week, that's it?

38:31.884 --> 38:33.785
Well, hey, come on,
it's parking tickets.

38:33.853 --> 38:35.420
Look, it's better than nothing.

38:35.488 --> 38:38.657
He'll be locked up, he won't be
able to hurt anybody.

38:38.724 --> 38:40.926
Maybe we can build a case
against him while he's inside.

38:40.993 --> 38:44.829
So congratulations, you got
your man for five to seven days.

38:44.897 --> 38:47.165
Well done.

38:48.434 --> 38:50.402
Bad news?

38:50.469 --> 38:53.939
I just sent the Centennial
Park Strangler to jail.

38:54.006 --> 38:54.940
Yay for you.

38:55.007 --> 38:56.508
For unpaid
parking tickets.

38:56.576 --> 38:57.509
Ooh.

38:57.577 --> 38:58.677
Yeah, he'll be out in

38:58.744 --> 39:00.979
a week at most.

39:01.047 --> 39:03.114
I just don't get it.

39:03.182 --> 39:04.115
What did I even accomplish here?

39:04.183 --> 39:05.450
I got a woman killed.

39:05.518 --> 39:06.618
Correction-- you got
a killer killed.

39:06.686 --> 39:08.620
Okay, point taken,

39:08.688 --> 39:10.188
but still,
the real Strangler,

39:10.256 --> 39:11.890
the one who enjoys
killing women--

39:11.958 --> 39:13.525
he'll be out
in less than a week.

39:15.461 --> 39:17.195
Please,

39:17.263 --> 39:18.396
I did what you wanted--

39:18.464 --> 39:20.265
I opened the safe,
I-I gave you the money.

39:20.333 --> 39:21.533
Please just go.

39:23.569 --> 39:26.638
No, not till I do this.

39:34.614 --> 39:36.514
It's okay.

39:36.582 --> 39:39.684
You don't need
to call anyone.

39:39.752 --> 39:43.154
That killer that you
just dreamed about--

39:43.222 --> 39:44.589
the police just arrested him

39:44.657 --> 39:47.826
outside a liquor store
a few hours ago.

39:47.893 --> 39:50.362
He was still covered
in the clerk's blood.

39:50.429 --> 39:51.963
It's an open-and-shut case.

39:52.031 --> 39:53.398
There's nothing for you to do.

39:53.466 --> 39:57.068
You'll understand if I don't
take your word for that.

39:58.437 --> 40:00.839
There's some people I
work with I need to call.

40:05.277 --> 40:07.278
I just wanted you
to know I'm not mad

40:07.346 --> 40:10.548
at you for putting me
in that man's path,

40:10.616 --> 40:12.450
for getting me killed.

40:12.518 --> 40:13.885
When you think
about what I did,

40:13.953 --> 40:16.054
the punishment kind of
fits the crime,

40:16.122 --> 40:17.222
don't you think?

40:17.289 --> 40:19.224
I think so, too.

40:19.291 --> 40:20.225
Excuse me.

40:20.292 --> 40:23.595
That girl I killed--
Melinda Sully--

40:23.663 --> 40:25.897
she was my patient.

40:25.965 --> 40:27.966
She came to me complaining
of blurry vision.

40:28.034 --> 40:30.835
I scanned her, told
her she was fine,

40:30.903 --> 40:32.537
probably just stress.

40:32.605 --> 40:34.906
Turned out
I was wrong.

40:34.974 --> 40:37.208
She had a
pituitary adenoma.

40:37.276 --> 40:39.210
It's a little...
little tumor tucked

40:39.278 --> 40:40.645
right in back
of the brain.

40:40.713 --> 40:42.514
It's tricky to diagnose.

40:42.581 --> 40:45.116
Side effects can
be devastating--

40:45.184 --> 40:47.452
blindness, heart disease.

40:47.520 --> 40:49.087
By the time she got
a second opinion

40:49.155 --> 40:50.789
and found out I was wrong,

40:50.856 --> 40:53.992
it was too late to operate.

40:56.062 --> 40:58.697
She sued me.

40:58.764 --> 41:00.932
She had a great case.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.434
She would have made millions

41:02.501 --> 41:05.837
and I would have become
uninsurable, lost my practice.

41:06.872 --> 41:08.873
So you murdered her?

41:10.376 --> 41:13.778
She wasn't married,
her parents were dead.

41:16.015 --> 41:18.616
There would be nobody to pick up
the case when she was gone.

41:18.684 --> 41:20.819
Well, somebody might have
picked it up,

41:20.886 --> 41:22.954
but without a victim
to point to,

41:23.022 --> 41:26.157
the case gets awfully thin.

41:26.225 --> 41:29.127
It's not my finest hour.

41:29.195 --> 41:32.397
That's why I wanted to do
everything I could to help you.

41:32.465 --> 41:34.699
That's why I sent you
that dream.

41:34.767 --> 41:37.869
That dream-- what does this have
to do with that dream?

41:37.937 --> 41:40.071
You saw that cute little heart

41:40.139 --> 41:42.073
right above
Mr. Shotgun's forehead...

41:43.609 --> 41:47.345
<i>...just like the one I had,</i>
<i>just like the one Gil had.</i>

41:49.281 --> 41:51.950
That's Gil's new boyfriend.

41:52.017 --> 41:55.353
They're perfect for each
other, don't you think?

41:55.421 --> 41:57.021
What are you talking about?

41:57.089 --> 42:00.592
That robbery happened in Sonoma.

42:00.659 --> 42:03.728
When they put our friend
into the holding cell,

42:03.796 --> 42:07.031
he was still so high on meth,
he could barely see straight.

42:07.099 --> 42:11.102
He took quite a shine
to his new cell mate.

42:11.170 --> 42:12.403
Gil tried playing hard to get.

42:12.471 --> 42:14.672
He even put up a fight,

42:14.740 --> 42:16.674
but it didn't end
too well for Gil.

42:16.742 --> 42:20.378
Oh, no.

42:23.149 --> 42:24.549
Don't bother.

42:25.885 --> 42:27.685
He just finished
smashing Gil's head

42:27.753 --> 42:29.754
against the metal toilet
in the cell.

42:32.825 --> 42:37.061
The prison medic pronounced Gil
dead five minutes ago.

42:39.799 --> 42:41.332
You should get
that, Allison.

42:41.400 --> 42:44.269
They're calling to
tell you the news.

42:48.974 --> 42:51.943
Don't look so upset.

42:52.011 --> 42:54.112
Destiny is just destiny.

42:55.414 --> 42:58.583
Sometimes two people
just find each other.

43:05.424 --> 43:07.358
