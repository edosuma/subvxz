a lot of it,

Still, you do not have
the money.

46:14.605 --> 46:17.208
In cash, no. Obviously, no.

46:17.242 --> 46:18.576
So I propose

46:18.609 --> 46:21.279
that you pay the ransom
out of the trust.

46:21.312 --> 46:23.714
Agreed?

46:23.748 --> 46:25.884
(laughs)

46:25.917 --> 46:27.953
Really?

46:27.986 --> 46:31.056
-(laughing): God. Really?
-Mm-hmm.

46:31.089 --> 46:32.690
Oh, God, thank you.

46:32.723 --> 46:36.527
Um, we ha-- we have a little
problem with time,

46:36.561 --> 46:39.197
given your allergy
to the telephone.

46:39.230 --> 46:41.399
-I...
-Lansing.

46:41.432 --> 46:43.468
(sighs)

46:45.370 --> 46:46.938
Signatures.

46:46.972 --> 46:50.141
Here, here, and here, please.

46:53.979 --> 46:55.813
I'm so glad that
we're finally able to...

46:55.847 --> 46:59.584
I can't tell you

46:59.617 --> 47:01.819
how pleased I am, Paul.

47:10.962 --> 47:14.699
Uh... wait.

47:16.667 --> 47:18.937
Wait.

47:18.970 --> 47:21.839
This is a-a loan?

47:21.873 --> 47:23.574
Minimally so, yes.

47:23.608 --> 47:25.576
It has an interest rate

47:25.610 --> 47:29.580
repayable at four percent
over base.

47:29.614 --> 47:31.682
-You're lending me the money.
-No.

47:31.716 --> 47:34.785
The trust is lending you
the money,

47:34.819 --> 47:36.187
and you have a responsibility

47:36.221 --> 47:38.990
-to pay it back.
-But it's my money.

47:39.024 --> 47:40.658
No, it's the trust's money.

47:40.691 --> 47:41.960
Money in the trust
that belongs to me.

47:41.993 --> 47:43.194
The money in the trust

47:43.228 --> 47:45.496
has been earned
entirely by my efforts.

47:45.530 --> 47:48.833
I don't want to get into
an argument about semantics...

47:48.866 --> 47:52.037
Semantics? Semantics.
You're gonna make a profit

47:52.070 --> 47:53.671
off the kidnapping
of your own grandson.

47:53.704 --> 47:56.007
-Oh, please.
Don't be ridiculous.
-(mutters)

47:56.041 --> 47:57.808
You know,
you-you can go to a bank

47:57.842 --> 47:59.677
and see what kind
of an interest rate you...

47:59.710 --> 48:01.646
Oh, God, I am so stupid.

48:01.679 --> 48:03.681
So stupid.

48:04.782 --> 48:06.817
I mean, I'm-I'm such an idiot.

48:06.851 --> 48:08.219
What are you talking about?

48:08.253 --> 48:10.221
I-I-I thought you were gonna
give me something.

48:10.255 --> 48:12.557
I thought you were
giving me something.

48:12.590 --> 48:15.326
I mean, all my life,
that is what I have wanted,

48:15.360 --> 48:19.164
for you to give me something,
anything. I don't care what.

48:19.197 --> 48:21.299
That-that little bit of pottery
in your pocket.

48:21.332 --> 48:23.901
It's worthless apparently,
everywhere

48:23.935 --> 48:26.972
apparently, but you still
had to have it back.

48:27.005 --> 48:31.076
And it's a loan of my money,
to me, with interest!

48:31.109 --> 48:32.643
Of course it is!

48:32.677 --> 48:35.713
-Paul, I am trying to help you.
-By burying me deeper

48:35.746 --> 48:37.882
and deeper?
Well, I will not do it.

48:37.915 --> 48:39.750
Do you hear me? Do you hear me?

48:39.784 --> 48:42.553
I will not be buried!
I can't do it anymore!

48:42.587 --> 48:44.089
No! No!

48:44.122 --> 48:46.424
No! No! No!

48:46.457 --> 48:48.459
(clock ticking)

48:59.270 --> 49:00.271
(flicks lighter)

49:10.982 --> 49:12.984
(flicks lighter)

49:19.324 --> 49:21.326
(film projector
whirring, clicking)

49:29.600 --> 49:31.602
(crying)

49:32.937 --> 49:34.772
(sobbing)

49:34.805 --> 49:38.543
(film ticking in projector)

49:38.576 --> 49:40.578
(sobbing):
No...

49:48.019 --> 49:50.955
No...

50:02.633 --> 50:05.770
(sighs deeply)

50:12.977 --> 50:14.979
Yes, sir.

50:15.980 --> 50:17.982
I understand.

50:34.799 --> 50:36.701
