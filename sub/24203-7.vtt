02:37.491 --> 02:39.493
(phone ringing)

02:50.804 --> 02:53.774
PAUL JR: Where is it,
where is it, where is it?

02:53.807 --> 02:56.143
-(phone continues ringing)
-Pauline, Pauline.

02:56.176 --> 02:58.846
Here it is. Look at this.
(chuckles)

02:58.879 --> 03:00.781
I love the outfit.

03:00.814 --> 03:03.451
Oh, this was California.

03:03.484 --> 03:06.720
It was 1960... I don't know.

03:06.754 --> 03:08.456
Little Paul was a baby,

03:08.489 --> 03:10.458
and I was literally out front,

03:10.491 --> 03:13.294
uh, pumping gas
and cleaning windshields.

03:13.327 --> 03:15.996
You look happy.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.965
Oh. Oh, we were. We were.

03:17.998 --> 03:21.335
Broke but... happy.

03:21.369 --> 03:25.406
Then this shows up out
of the blue from the old man.

03:25.439 --> 03:30.344
"Dear Paul, I was pleased
to hear from George

03:30.378 --> 03:33.180
"that you are working hard
pumping gas for Getty Oil.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.148
"What better place to learn
about the oil industry

themselves?

03:37.618 --> 03:41.389
"It's time you were promoted.

03:41.422 --> 03:44.325
"Come to Italy.
It's time we met.

03:44.358 --> 03:47.094
Your loving father."

03:49.663 --> 03:51.665
"Your loving father."

04:18.225 --> 04:19.927
Oh.

04:19.960 --> 04:23.897
Well, at least I won't have
to pick him out of a crowd.

04:23.931 --> 04:25.966
I don't even know
if I could recognize him.

04:25.999 --> 04:27.668
-It's been so long.
-GAIL: Your own father?

04:27.701 --> 04:29.903
PAUL JR.:
Oh, it's been 15 years.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.372
He's not like your father.

04:31.405 --> 04:33.374
PAUL:
Paul.

04:33.407 --> 04:34.475
(door closes)

04:37.478 --> 04:41.449
Hi, uh... Dad.

04:41.482 --> 04:44.418
Hmm. You may call me Paul.

04:46.454 --> 04:48.288
Gail, I presume.

04:48.322 --> 04:50.924
Yes. Lovely to meet you.

04:50.958 --> 04:53.894
Why didn't you tell me
your wife was so pretty?

04:53.927 --> 04:55.262
Oh, well, I...

04:55.295 --> 04:57.097
PAUL: I trust the flight
was satisfactory.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.932
Oh, it was amazing.

04:58.966 --> 05:01.369
-Thank you.
-PAUL III: Are you my granddad?

05:01.402 --> 05:03.704
-PAUL: Yes.
-Well, how do you do?

05:03.737 --> 05:05.806
Now, how do you do?

05:05.839 --> 05:07.541
-I'm Paul.
-I'm Paul, too.

05:07.575 --> 05:08.776
I know, silly.

05:08.809 --> 05:11.712
-PAUL: Ah.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.297
PAUL:
Don't you have a nanny?

05:30.330 --> 05:32.766
-PAUL JR.:
Oh, no, no. We can't, uh...
-Come here.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.167
-(chuckling):
We can't afford one.
-Sweetie.

05:34.201 --> 05:35.703
Really?

05:35.736 --> 05:38.271

05:38.305 --> 05:40.307

Come on, Ma.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.742
(whispering):
Paul.

05:41.775 --> 05:43.143
(whispering):
Hey, can't you keep him quiet?

05:43.176 --> 05:45.312
He's tired, hungry and bored.
So am I.

05:45.345 --> 05:46.647
Gail, this is important.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.982
I know.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.684
Does Renaissance art

05:50.718 --> 05:52.853
not interest our young visitor?

05:52.886 --> 05:54.622
Oh. I'm sorry.

05:54.655 --> 05:57.057
He's not usually so, um...

05:57.090 --> 05:59.159
It's just that
it's his dinnertime.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.294
Well, it's really his bedtime.

06:01.328 --> 06:02.896
Oh, the Italians eat late,

06:02.930 --> 06:06.133
pay late,
they do everything late...

06:06.166 --> 06:07.535
but they sure can paint.

06:07.568 --> 06:10.838
Paul, let me show you something.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.339
Do you know what a hammer is?

06:12.372 --> 06:14.174
Yes.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.977
-And do you know what a nail is?
-Yes.

06:17.010 --> 06:18.779
Well, that, young man,

06:18.812 --> 06:22.349
is all you need to know
about crucifixion.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.485
Now, these fellas here

06:24.518 --> 06:27.154
have decided that this old man
with the beard,

06:27.187 --> 06:28.756
Peter, shouldn't believe

06:28.789 --> 06:30.891
in the things
that he believes in,

06:30.924 --> 06:33.827
so they took a hammer
and some nails

06:33.861 --> 06:35.863
and they banged them
straight through his hands

06:35.896 --> 06:40.200
and his feet to that piece
of wood there.

06:40.233 --> 06:44.071
Bang, bang, bang. See?

06:44.104 --> 06:47.808
And then they stuck that
piece of wood up in the air

06:47.841 --> 06:51.078
and left him hanging there
until he was dead.

06:51.111 --> 06:53.547
What do you think of that?

06:55.649 --> 06:57.184
Do you want to know
what happened

06:57.217 --> 06:58.786
to this poor fella here?

06:58.819 --> 07:02.089
(sighs)
It was perfectly unpleasant.

07:02.122 --> 07:03.190
Herod was having dinner...

07:03.223 --> 07:05.258
Well, maybe another time.

07:05.292 --> 07:06.927
(chuckling):
Yes, yes.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.730
We will go and have
our own dinner,

07:09.763 --> 07:12.232
and I will show you a rabbit.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.635
(Offenbach's "Barcarolle" from
The Tales of Hoffmann playing)

07:23.443 --> 07:27.881
PAUL: Look out for the bird,
little rabbit.

07:27.915 --> 07:30.383
Look out for the bird.

07:30.417 --> 07:33.453
Oh. Did you see the bird?

07:33.487 --> 07:34.922
No.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.323
PAUL:
Strange.

07:36.356 --> 07:38.592
Neither do I.

07:40.427 --> 07:41.895
A bird!

07:41.929 --> 07:44.064
PAUL:
What do you say?

07:44.097 --> 07:46.433
Watch out for the bird,
little rabbit.

07:46.466 --> 07:47.434
Watch out for the bird.

07:47.467 --> 07:50.003
What bird?

07:50.037 --> 07:52.405
Oh, look, now, someone else

07:52.439 --> 07:54.141
has come to see you.

07:54.174 --> 07:56.143
The sandman.

07:56.176 --> 07:58.178
He's come to say good night.

07:58.211 --> 08:00.814
Watch him closely.

08:00.848 --> 08:02.550
Count to three.

08:02.583 --> 08:05.886
One... two...

08:05.919 --> 08:08.355
three.

08:13.460 --> 08:15.228
How did you do that?

08:15.262 --> 08:16.564
(Paul chuckles)

08:16.597 --> 08:19.032
I like him.

08:19.066 --> 08:21.602
I don't care for children,

08:21.635 --> 08:23.637
but him I like.

08:25.673 --> 08:27.875
Put him to bed, will you?

08:27.908 --> 08:31.344
We have business to discuss.

08:31.378 --> 08:34.948
Yes. Of course.

08:43.891 --> 08:47.628
You have an appetite.
I can see that.

08:47.661 --> 08:49.429
-An appetite?
-Mm-hmm.

08:49.462 --> 08:52.265
I saw you looking
at that waitress back there.

08:52.299 --> 08:54.167
-Oh, I'm a happily married man,
sir.
-(scoffs)

08:54.201 --> 08:58.438
Probably true but irrelevant.

08:58.471 --> 09:02.743
Drink. Food. Sex. Appetite.

09:02.776 --> 09:06.847
You need that to succeed.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.982
And then there's money,
of course.

09:09.016 --> 09:12.586
You have an appetite
for that, too?

09:12.620 --> 09:15.989
Well, we could certainly use
a bit more. That's for sure.

09:16.023 --> 09:18.826
Don't play the self-effacing
lapdog with me.

09:18.859 --> 09:22.395
There's millions in the trust.

09:22.429 --> 09:26.600
Hundreds of millions
and you know it.

09:26.634 --> 09:27.935
Is that your appetite?

09:27.968 --> 09:31.271
Yeah, looks like it, doesn't it?

09:31.304 --> 09:34.374
But you can only drive
one car at a time.

09:34.407 --> 09:37.745
You can only live in one house
at a time.

09:37.778 --> 09:39.847
No.

09:39.880 --> 09:45.686
What money gives you is power...
and that

09:45.719 --> 09:50.390
is the real ache in the balls,
young man.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.259
Power.

09:52.292 --> 09:56.529
A bit of it makes you want
a lot of it,

09:56.563 --> 10:01.368
and a lot of it
makes you want all of it.

10:01.401 --> 10:03.370
(chuckles)

10:03.403 --> 10:05.873
You want some?

10:10.277 --> 10:12.746
(door opens and closes)

10:15.315 --> 10:17.651
Well?

10:17.685 --> 10:20.353
Jesus.

10:20.387 --> 10:23.090
It's a promotion, all right.

10:23.123 --> 10:26.126
So, why does it look
like you've just been fired?

10:26.159 --> 10:28.128
Because it's in Saudi Arabia.

10:28.161 --> 10:29.797
Oh.

10:29.830 --> 10:32.565
Yeah. Oh.

10:32.599 --> 10:34.601
He wants me to run
the whole setup down there.

10:34.634 --> 10:37.304
The whole goddamn thing.

10:37.337 --> 10:40.040
It's a huge job.
It's massive.

10:40.073 --> 10:41.875
(whispering):
He's showing his faith in you.

10:41.909 --> 10:43.977
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

10:44.011 --> 10:46.747
-He likes you.
-Yeah?

10:46.780 --> 10:50.650
He likes you, too, the old goat.

10:50.684 --> 10:54.321
Actually, I, I saw him
looking down my cleavage.

10:54.354 --> 10:57.024
-No.
-Yeah.

10:57.057 --> 11:00.627
-Jesus, those eyes.
-(pouring drink)

11:00.660 --> 11:03.496
(Paul Jr. sighs deeply)

11:06.734 --> 11:08.435
It's only a couple
of years, right?

11:08.468 --> 11:10.270
-(scoffs)
-And then we'll be transferred

11:10.303 --> 11:12.339
-back to the States.
-Yeah.

11:12.372 --> 11:14.842
I'm in if you are.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.879
Thank you.

11:18.912 --> 11:21.481
Well, drink up.

11:21.514 --> 11:22.783
Because all we're gonna
be getting in Saudi

11:22.816 --> 11:24.017
is some potato hooch

11:24.051 --> 11:25.786
that we buy off a Bedouin.

11:25.819 --> 11:29.790
And I hope you're happy
wearing a veil.

11:29.823 --> 11:31.591
Because that is all
you're going to be wearing.

11:31.624 --> 11:33.193
-Don't be stupid.
-(laughing)

11:36.063 --> 11:38.832
God, it's amazing...

11:38.866 --> 11:41.168
the shadow puppets.

11:43.837 --> 11:45.538
He never did that with me.

11:45.572 --> 11:48.508
He never did anything.

11:48.541 --> 11:52.279
-Poor baby.

12:28.648 --> 12:29.883
Well, well, well.

12:29.917 --> 12:32.719
(chuckles)

12:32.752 --> 12:35.755
Archaeologists have combed here,

12:35.789 --> 12:37.590
and you find this.

12:37.624 --> 12:39.993
Two and a half thousand years

12:40.027 --> 12:43.831
it's been waiting
for you to find it.

12:43.864 --> 12:46.533
You're gonna go far, young man.

12:46.566 --> 12:50.170
May I have this?
No, you want it back.

12:50.203 --> 12:52.705
All right, you can have it back.

12:52.739 --> 12:54.441
You just have to tell me

12:54.474 --> 12:56.009
which hand it's in, okay?

12:56.043 --> 12:58.278
Wrong.

12:58.311 --> 13:00.447
Ah...
(laughing)

13:02.549 --> 13:05.418
(film projector
whirring, clicking)

13:05.452 --> 13:08.822
PAUL JR.: We went all over,
the four of us.

13:08.856 --> 13:11.925
Like a... like a proper family.

13:11.959 --> 13:15.395
You know, blue skies,
laughter...

13:15.428 --> 13:18.398
The wine was cold, the sun hot.

13:18.431 --> 13:21.634
My wife-- this beautiful,
flame-haired angel--

13:21.668 --> 13:24.972
my son, my father.
He-he liked me.

13:26.439 --> 13:29.509
Jesus Christ, he liked me.

13:31.078 --> 13:34.982
Just for a while, for a while...

13:35.015 --> 13:37.050
we were happy.

13:44.291 --> 13:46.393
CHACE:
Where are the children, ma'am?

13:46.426 --> 13:48.161
-They're at La Fuserna.
-Oh.

13:48.195 --> 13:50.230
I thought it should just be
the two of us

13:50.263 --> 13:54.501
when he... you know... is back.

13:54.534 --> 13:57.270
Um, it's gonna be his birthday.

13:57.304 --> 13:58.805
Hmm.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.840
Isn't that, um...?

14:02.542 --> 14:04.945
It is going to happen,
isn't it, Chace?

14:04.978 --> 14:06.980
Everything's on schedule.
Contracts are drawn up.

14:07.014 --> 14:08.681
Money's being counted.

14:08.715 --> 14:12.385
Um, there are a few
loose ends to tie up

14:12.419 --> 14:13.686
that'll make him look pretty,

14:13.720 --> 14:17.057
and other than that,
we're good to go.

14:17.090 --> 14:19.993
And Paul, he's met
with the old man?

14:20.027 --> 14:22.129
I believe that's
an ongoing situation.

14:22.162 --> 14:24.464
You know they don't get on.

14:24.497 --> 14:27.467
Well, to my understanding,
it's just business now.

14:28.902 --> 14:33.974
They're not normal, Chace--
the Gettys.

14:34.007 --> 14:37.510
It's okay, he's your boss.
I know you can't say.

14:37.544 --> 14:40.813
They seem normal human beings,

14:40.847 --> 14:45.052
but there's a slice
of pure animal in the old man.

14:45.085 --> 14:48.221
-Animal?
-Yeah, you know, that thing

14:48.255 --> 14:51.925
that the rest of humanity
holds onto for dear life?

14:51.959 --> 14:54.594
Love, compassion,
care, kindness--

14:54.627 --> 14:57.297
whatever you want to call it.

14:57.330 --> 15:02.535
There is a... a-a switch

15:02.569 --> 15:06.239
in him that clicks.
(snaps fingers)

15:06.273 --> 15:08.541
And it's gone.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.177
(camera whirring,
seagulls squawking)

15:14.681 --> 15:18.185
-You know how to swim?
-PAUL III: No.

15:18.218 --> 15:20.387
-Well, it's important.
-Will you teach me?

15:20.420 --> 15:21.621
(Paul laughs)

15:21.654 --> 15:23.423
You don't want me to teach you.

15:23.456 --> 15:24.724
I do.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.826
I suggest not.

15:26.859 --> 15:28.828
Yes.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.833
If you insist.

15:35.902 --> 15:37.270
-(Gail gasps)
-PAUL JR.: Hey!

15:37.304 --> 15:39.372
(muffled):
What the hell?

15:39.406 --> 15:42.542
-Paul, get him!
-No, wait. Leave him.

15:42.575 --> 15:46.946
GAIL (muffled):
Paul! Paul!

15:48.648 --> 15:50.650
â™ª

16:15.508 --> 16:16.976
The water's pretty cold.

16:17.010 --> 16:19.312
Winter's coming, I guess.

16:19.346 --> 16:21.014
Here.

16:21.048 --> 16:24.784
-For me?
-For you.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.253
You are going home.

16:28.455 --> 16:29.856
Really?

16:32.625 --> 16:34.294
Yeah?

16:34.327 --> 16:37.164
(sniffs)

16:43.503 --> 16:45.605
How could you do that?

16:45.638 --> 16:46.706
What if he drowned?

16:46.739 --> 16:49.008
I don't do "what if."

16:49.042 --> 16:52.345
He didn't, and now he can swim.

16:55.148 --> 16:57.550
Hey. Jesus.

16:57.584 --> 16:59.586
What's the matter with him?

17:03.556 --> 17:06.493
(Paul III muttering)

17:06.526 --> 17:10.130
Saudi's not much
of a place, you know.

17:10.163 --> 17:12.031
No, but, hey, all part
of learning the ropes.

17:12.065 --> 17:15.968
Right?
And I do appreciate you

17:16.002 --> 17:18.571
putting your trust in me, sir.

17:18.605 --> 17:20.073
It's not like Italy.

17:20.107 --> 17:22.375
A lot of sand.

17:22.409 --> 17:23.510
Ceremony.

17:23.543 --> 17:26.213
Not much sex.

17:26.246 --> 17:29.316
(laughing hoarsely)

17:29.349 --> 17:31.318
You-you okay?

17:31.351 --> 17:34.354
We... We-we could...
(laughs)

17:34.387 --> 17:36.656
We could-- we could what?

17:36.689 --> 17:38.725
W-We could...
(laughing)

17:38.758 --> 17:42.529
-(laughing): What?
-We could send Gordon...

17:42.562 --> 17:44.331
in your place.

17:44.364 --> 17:46.566
Well-well, but Gordon, Gordon
doesn't know the first thing

17:46.599 --> 17:48.701
-about oil.
-I know.

17:48.735 --> 17:51.504
Not a thing.
(laughing)

17:51.538 --> 17:54.841
But what about me?
I mean, I, I-I want to work.

17:54.874 --> 17:57.244
(laughing): Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
You stay in Italy.

17:57.277 --> 17:59.879
Mm. That's what
I've been doing here--

17:59.912 --> 18:01.714
buying out Piomboil.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.150
Somebody has to run it.

18:03.183 --> 18:05.185
You.

18:06.219 --> 18:08.221
Me? Really?

18:08.255 --> 18:09.922
Why not?

18:11.291 --> 18:14.394
Gordon.
(laughing hoarsely)

18:29.642 --> 18:31.644
Buongiorno.
(clears throat)

18:33.713 --> 18:35.582
(Paul Jr. clears throat)

18:39.519 --> 18:41.254
Paul.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.239
Wow.

18:59.272 --> 19:00.973
What a place.

19:01.007 --> 19:03.075
Needs to be taken in hand, Paul.

19:03.109 --> 19:04.911
You know that they take

19:04.944 --> 19:08.915
a two-hour lunch,
for God's sakes.

19:08.948 --> 19:12.018
Needs to be trimmed down
to its essential.

19:12.051 --> 19:14.954
Squeeze it till it starts
turning a profit.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.223
Yes, of course.

19:16.256 --> 19:17.524
You're going to have to let
at least

19:17.557 --> 19:19.292
half of those people go.

19:19.326 --> 19:21.528
What, th-them?

19:21.561 --> 19:23.363
Which ones?

19:23.396 --> 19:26.566
Well, you're in charge.
You choose.

19:26.599 --> 19:28.468
I'm gonna keep in touch
with you.

19:28.501 --> 19:29.502
You'll keep in touch with me?

19:29.536 --> 19:31.371
Yes. I have to go to England.

19:31.404 --> 19:33.039
What, England?

19:33.072 --> 19:35.408
Stop repeating everything I say.

19:35.442 --> 19:37.076
-But...
-Yeah, but I will be in touch

19:37.109 --> 19:40.480
with you every evening at 7:45.

19:40.513 --> 19:43.250
Make sure you are available
for the call. All right?

19:43.283 --> 19:44.784
I will be.

19:44.817 --> 19:46.819
-(laughing): It's gonna be fine.
-(laughing): Yeah.

19:46.853 --> 19:49.822
-Just choose well.
-(chuckles)

19:53.092 --> 19:54.661
(sighs)

19:57.230 --> 19:58.197
(door shuts)

19:58.231 --> 20:00.933
Well, I'm, uh...

20:00.967 --> 20:03.236
I'm afraid we're gonna
have to let you go.

20:06.005 --> 20:09.709
Your position is
no longer available.

20:13.513 --> 20:15.014
I'm terribly sorry.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.148
It is impossible!

20:17.183 --> 20:20.019
I'm s-- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

20:35.368 --> 20:36.769
(man shouting in Italian)

20:47.480 --> 20:49.482
PAUL:
No, that's a bad idea.

20:49.516 --> 20:52.452
All of it?
The, the entire proposal?

20:52.485 --> 20:53.986
Why would we expand

20:54.020 --> 20:57.590
at a time of such
international uncertainty?

20:57.624 --> 20:59.392
Because the price of oil
will go up.

20:59.426 --> 21:02.995
You might care to gamble
the family silver on that,

21:03.029 --> 21:04.964
but I do not.

21:04.997 --> 21:06.799
â™ª Wow! â™ª

21:09.035 --> 21:11.304
PAUL: All right, but don't
embark on that by yourself,

21:11.338 --> 21:14.040
for heaven's sakes.
You need Enzo on that.

21:14.073 --> 21:16.242
-Get him on it.
-But Enzo doesn't work
for us anymore.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.244
You let him go?

21:18.277 --> 21:20.913
-Well, I-- you...
-Enzo is the sharpest mind

21:20.947 --> 21:22.682
in the whole company.

21:22.715 --> 21:24.283
Was.

21:24.317 --> 21:26.285
E-Extraordinary decision.

21:26.319 --> 21:29.456
-I...
-(disconnect tone)

21:29.489 --> 21:31.691
PAUL JR.: Now, we sign
a five-year contract,

21:31.724 --> 21:36.128
and even if their shipping
costs go up, our bill doesn't.

21:36.162 --> 21:40.767
It was a tough negotiation,
but Onassis will undercut

21:40.800 --> 21:44.971
any rival carrier by 15%.

21:45.004 --> 21:46.639
(clapping)

21:46.673 --> 21:48.274
PAUL:
Good work, Paul.

21:48.307 --> 21:49.476
Thank you.

21:49.509 --> 21:52.211
But no.

21:52.244 --> 21:54.013
-No?
-No. I've decided

21:54.046 --> 21:55.815
not to go forward with that.

21:55.848 --> 21:57.984
I think we should purchase
our own tankers.

21:58.017 --> 22:01.053
I mean, why pay someone else
to ship our oil

22:01.087 --> 22:03.289
when we can ship it ourselves?

22:03.322 --> 22:06.058
And you decide
to tell me this now?

22:06.092 --> 22:07.860
I wanted you to have
the opportunity

22:07.894 --> 22:09.295
to make your proposal.

22:09.328 --> 22:11.398
And it's very promising.

22:11.431 --> 22:14.967
It's just not
as promising as mine.

22:15.001 --> 22:16.636
(exhales)

22:16.669 --> 22:18.471
â™ª Wow! â™ª

22:21.140 --> 22:24.811
(screaming)

22:24.844 --> 22:26.446
(yells)

22:26.479 --> 22:28.481
(disconnect tone)

22:41.060 --> 22:43.062
(exhales)

22:46.365 --> 22:49.101
("Tutto Nero (Paint It Black)"
by Caterina Caselli playing)

22:49.135 --> 22:52.304
(shouting)

22:57.410 --> 22:59.412
(woman singing in Italian)

23:01.213 --> 23:03.215
(Paul Jr. shouting)

23:27.239 --> 23:29.241
(dogs barking in distance)

23:34.213 --> 23:38.685
GAIL: It's not an excuse,
but I was lonely.

23:38.718 --> 23:41.988
Even with four kids?

23:42.021 --> 23:44.857
Only a man could say that.

23:44.891 --> 23:50.362
Yes, even with four beautiful,
beautiful children,

23:50.396 --> 23:51.964
I couldn't have been lonelier.

23:51.998 --> 23:53.232
Huh.

23:54.634 --> 23:58.237
Makes you do stupid things.

23:58.270 --> 24:00.272
(singing in Italian continues)

24:05.812 --> 24:09.281
Darling, well,
you're not even dressed.

24:09.315 --> 24:11.951
We were due there ages ago.

24:11.984 --> 24:15.955
Well, I got to get this right
before the old bastard calls.

24:15.988 --> 24:18.357
(sighs)
Well...

24:18.390 --> 24:20.793
Can't it just wait?

24:20.827 --> 24:22.562
This once?

24:22.595 --> 24:24.396
It's gonna be fun.

24:24.430 --> 24:27.600
The-the actors from Roman
Invasion are gonna be there.

24:27.634 --> 24:31.037
And, um, you know, they're gonna
do some scenes, and...

24:31.070 --> 24:32.438
Why don't you take-take
Little Paul?

24:32.471 --> 24:33.906
He loves that stuff.

24:33.940 --> 24:36.275
Please?

24:43.850 --> 24:46.018
Paul, honey?

24:46.052 --> 24:47.654
You're my date!

24:47.687 --> 24:50.089
Again.

24:50.122 --> 24:52.124
(trumpets playing)

24:53.192 --> 24:55.194
(camera whirring, clicking)

24:59.866 --> 25:01.868
(overlapping chatter)

25:14.346 --> 25:16.348
Grazie.

25:23.489 --> 25:25.224
(shouts)

25:25.257 --> 25:27.193
(audience gasps)

25:27.226 --> 25:29.228
(applause)

25:51.517 --> 25:53.519
(cheering, applause)

25:54.854 --> 25:56.856
(grunts)

25:59.191 --> 26:01.560
(laughs)

26:04.363 --> 26:06.666
LUCIA:
I like your new boyfriend.

26:06.699 --> 26:08.200
GAIL:
Shut up.

26:09.769 --> 26:12.404
LUCIA: I'm serious,
he's definitely looking at you.

26:12.438 --> 26:14.607
No, he isn't.

26:14.641 --> 26:17.076
But even if he was, I'm married.

26:17.109 --> 26:19.912
I thought you and Paul, you
know, you had an arrangement.

26:19.946 --> 26:22.749
We do, but...

26:22.782 --> 26:24.751
I've never acted on it.

26:24.784 --> 26:26.485
Well, Paul has.

26:26.518 --> 26:29.856
And, Gail, I mean, where is he?

26:29.889 --> 26:32.759
Where is he, ever?

26:32.792 --> 26:34.794
Ladies.

26:38.164 --> 26:40.867
Tesserarius Lang Jeffries,
of the Ninth Legion,

26:40.900 --> 26:42.168
at your service.

26:42.201 --> 26:44.203
Gail.

26:45.404 --> 26:47.439
An honor.

26:47.473 --> 26:49.475
(woman singing in Italian)

27:07.059 --> 27:08.494
PAUL:
Are you sick?

27:08.527 --> 27:09.495
PAUL JR.:
No, no.

27:09.528 --> 27:11.397
You're not on top of it.

27:11.430 --> 27:13.565
Any of it.

27:13.599 --> 27:16.268
They tell me you're hardly ever
at your desk in the morning.

27:16.302 --> 27:18.270
What's going on?

27:18.304 --> 27:20.539
I'm trying my best, sir.

27:20.572 --> 27:21.741
Do better.

27:21.774 --> 27:23.275
(exhales)
I'm trying,

27:23.309 --> 27:24.576
but every time I do something,

27:24.610 --> 27:26.813
you suggest I do
something different.

27:26.846 --> 27:29.481
I have 40 years'
business experience.

27:29.515 --> 27:31.650
You expect me to stand by

27:31.684 --> 27:35.154
and watch you make
a fool of yourself?

27:35.187 --> 27:36.622
No.

27:36.655 --> 27:39.625
Take the advice
from someone who knows.

27:39.658 --> 27:41.660
I hear your marriage
is in trouble.

27:41.694 --> 27:43.095
(scoffs)

27:43.129 --> 27:44.864
That'll cost you.

27:44.897 --> 27:46.866
You're not focused.

27:46.899 --> 27:49.836
I've talked to Enzo,
I'm bringing him back.

27:49.869 --> 27:51.437
Oh, right.

27:51.470 --> 27:54.406
PAUL: Take some time off,
sort yourself out.

27:54.440 --> 27:56.175
PAUL JR.:
How much time?

27:56.208 --> 27:57.309
Wait, wait.

27:57.343 --> 27:58.945
Are you firing me?

27:58.978 --> 28:00.446
(sniffles, exhales)

28:00.479 --> 28:04.316
Paul, I'm hearing talk
about drink and drugs.

28:04.350 --> 28:07.453
-(scoffs)
-But that accounts for the mess
we're in around here.

28:07.486 --> 28:09.655
Well, maybe if you'd let me
handle a few things myself...

28:09.688 --> 28:14.961
Paul, no one who takes drugs
works for me.

28:14.994 --> 28:16.963
You know that-- nobody.

28:16.996 --> 28:18.965
(exhales)

28:18.998 --> 28:22.668
We'll talk again
when you're better.

28:22.701 --> 28:24.103
â™ª One, two â™ª

28:24.136 --> 28:25.504
-(sniffles)
-â™ª One, two, three... â™ª

28:25.537 --> 28:27.539
(camera whirring)

28:41.788 --> 28:43.022
(whirring stops)

28:45.391 --> 28:46.592
(whirring)

28:57.103 --> 28:59.105
(whirring stops)

29:04.243 --> 29:06.512
PAUL JR.:
Well, we had an arrangement.

29:06.545 --> 29:09.548
It was the '60s, right?

29:09.581 --> 29:12.484
Let it all hang out, baby.

29:12.518 --> 29:15.687
GAIL: The idea was,
we could see other people,

29:15.721 --> 29:18.557
but we'd stay married.

29:18.590 --> 29:20.459
For the kids.

29:20.492 --> 29:22.829
And how'd that work out?

29:22.862 --> 29:26.632
How it always works out,
I imagine.

29:28.634 --> 29:30.436
(brakes squeak)

29:30.469 --> 29:31.703

29:43.449 --> 29:45.117

29:54.760 --> 29:56.896
If you look up, the dome

29:56.929 --> 29:59.798
of the church causes
an extraordinary effect,

29:59.832 --> 30:02.101
similar to the famous
whispering gallery

30:02.134 --> 30:03.970
in St. Paul's Cathedral
in London.

30:05.471 --> 30:07.439
If you sit in the center here,

30:07.473 --> 30:10.776
your voice is channeled through
this grate down to the crypt,

30:10.809 --> 30:12.879
where both your friends
and your enemies

30:12.912 --> 30:15.714
may listen to it.

30:15.747 --> 30:18.150
If we turn our attention
to the...

30:18.184 --> 30:19.986
GAIL:
Paul.

30:20.019 --> 30:22.254
He saw us.

30:22.288 --> 30:24.623
So we met in a church.

30:24.656 --> 30:26.392
He's gonna find out soon enough.

30:26.425 --> 30:28.094
Not yet.

30:28.127 --> 30:29.761
When I'm ready.

30:29.795 --> 30:32.331
JEFFRIES:
I want to be with you.

30:32.364 --> 30:35.167
I love you, Gail.

30:35.201 --> 30:36.869
Will you still love me
when I have no money?

30:36.903 --> 30:38.804
I won't take a cent from him.

30:38.837 --> 30:40.372
I got a job at Lucia's.

30:40.406 --> 30:41.840
-It pays the rent, but I...
-It's...

30:41.874 --> 30:44.276
It's not about the money.

30:44.310 --> 30:45.644
(laughs softly)

30:45.677 --> 30:47.646
Well, you're clearly
not a Getty.

30:47.679 --> 30:50.282
Damn right, there.

30:50.316 --> 30:52.985
I want to be
with you, too, Lang,

30:53.019 --> 30:57.323
but this is going to break
his little heart.

30:57.356 --> 30:59.525
JEFFRIES:
He'll adjust.

30:59.558 --> 31:01.127
Kids are adaptable.

31:01.160 --> 31:03.963
GAIL:
Paul loves his dad.

31:03.996 --> 31:05.331
JEFFRIES:
That's okay.

31:05.364 --> 31:07.666
I'm not stopping him.

31:07.699 --> 31:09.401
But we need to be together.

31:09.435 --> 31:11.537
You and me.

31:11.570 --> 31:14.373
Like it or not, he's just gonna
have to get used to that.

31:14.406 --> 31:17.409
â™ª

31:25.817 --> 31:27.786
Hi.

31:29.555 --> 31:33.692
Sorry, I bumped into Lang,
which I know you saw.

31:35.294 --> 31:38.030
Do you know why this church
is famous?

31:38.064 --> 31:39.765
Because it's beautiful?

31:39.798 --> 31:42.201
-(scoffs)
-No?

31:42.234 --> 31:44.570
No.

31:44.603 --> 31:47.573
Why don't you educate me,
smart-ass?

31:47.606 --> 31:50.409
The shape of the dome
creates an acoustic weirdness,

31:50.442 --> 31:52.678
like a magic trick.

31:52.711 --> 31:55.181
Wow.

31:55.214 --> 31:57.583
If you stand below the grill
in the middle,

31:57.616 --> 31:59.785
you can hear people
from all over the church.

31:59.818 --> 32:02.054
Wow.

32:02.088 --> 32:03.722
Cool.

32:06.458 --> 32:08.894
Hey.

32:32.884 --> 32:34.853
(sighing)

32:39.158 --> 32:41.160
(Leonardo laughs)

32:44.863 --> 32:47.699
What are you gonna do
with the money?

32:47.733 --> 32:49.668
(grunts)

32:51.703 --> 32:53.905
I don't know.

32:53.939 --> 32:55.307
(Paul III scoffs)

32:55.341 --> 32:57.943
You're just like my grandfather.

32:57.976 --> 33:00.246
All that money, he doesn't know
what to do with it.

33:00.279 --> 33:02.348
No, no, no, no. Big difference.

33:02.381 --> 33:05.484
We are poor.

33:05.517 --> 33:07.019
We will spend it.

I pay the next day.

Everything I have.

33:22.301 --> 33:27.306
Yeah. My, uh... my dad's tricky.

33:27.339 --> 33:31.143
You know, sick in the head.

33:31.177 --> 33:33.812
-Ah, pazzo.
-Pazzo.

33:33.845 --> 33:36.782
He was in love.

33:36.815 --> 33:38.684
Yeah.

33:38.717 --> 33:41.587
With this, uh, beautiful woman.

33:41.620 --> 33:44.223
Not his wife?

33:44.256 --> 33:46.292
No, my mom--
she ran off with an idiot,

33:46.325 --> 33:49.495
and my dad fell in love
with someone else.

No, I'm going to give them
much more than that.

45:59.290 --> 46:03.929
to a ransom of $5 million
payable within a week.

46:03.962 --> 46:06.865
Oh, right. $5 million, well...

46:06.898 --> 46:09.334
that's a good price.

46:09.367 --> 46:11.803
It's considerably less
than the asking price.

46:11.837 --> 46:14.572
Still, you do not have
the money.

46:14.605 --> 46:17.208
In cash, no. Obviously, no.

46:17.242 --> 46:18.576
So I propose

46:18.609 --> 46:21.279
that you pay the ransom
out of the trust.

46:21.312 --> 46:23.714
Agreed?

46:23.748 --> 46:25.884
(laughs)

46:25.917 --> 46:27.953
Really?

46:27.986 --> 46:31.056
-(laughing): God. Really?
-Mm-hmm.

46:31.089 --> 46:32.690
Oh, God, thank you.

46:32.723 --> 46:36.527
Um, we ha-- we have a little
problem with time,

46:36.561 --> 46:39.197
given your allergy
to the telephone.

46:39.230 --> 46:41.399
-I...
-Lansing.

46:41.432 --> 46:43.468
(sighs)

46:45.370 --> 46:46.938
Signatures.

46:46.972 --> 46:50.141
Here, here, and here, please.

46:53.979 --> 46:55.813
I'm so glad that
we're finally able to...

46:55.847 --> 46:59.584
I can't tell you

46:59.617 --> 47:01.819
how pleased I am, Paul.

47:10.962 --> 47:14.699
Uh... wait.

47:16.667 --> 47:18.937
Wait.

47:18.970 --> 47:21.839
This is a-a loan?

47:21.873 --> 47:23.574
Minimally so, yes.

47:23.608 --> 47:25.576
It has an interest rate

47:25.610 --> 47:29.580
repayable at four percent
over base.

47:29.614 --> 47:31.682
-You're lending me the money.
-No.

47:31.716 --> 47:34.785
The trust is lending you
the money,

47:34.819 --> 47:36.187
and you have a responsibility

47:36.221 --> 47:38.990
-to pay it back.
-But it's my money.

47:39.024 --> 47:40.658
No, it's the trust's money.

47:40.691 --> 47:41.960
Money in the trust
that belongs to me.

47:41.993 --> 47:43.194
The money in the trust

47:43.228 --> 47:45.496
has been earned
entirely by my efforts.

47:45.530 --> 47:48.833
I don't want to get into
an argument about semantics...

47:48.866 --> 47:52.037
Semantics? Semantics.
You're gonna make a profit

47:52.070 --> 47:53.671
off the kidnapping
of your own grandson.

47:53.704 --> 47:56.007
-Oh, please.
Don't be ridiculous.
-(mutters)

47:56.041 --> 47:57.808
You know,
you-you can go to a bank

47:57.842 --> 47:59.677
and see what kind
of an interest rate you...

47:59.710 --> 48:01.646
Oh, God, I am so stupid.

48:01.679 --> 48:03.681
So stupid.

48:04.782 --> 48:06.817
I mean, I'm-I'm such an idiot.

48:06.851 --> 48:08.219
What are you talking about?

48:08.253 --> 48:10.221
I-I-I thought you were gonna
give me something.

48:10.255 --> 48:12.557
I thought you were
giving me something.

48:12.590 --> 48:15.326
I mean, all my life,
that is what I have wanted,

48:15.360 --> 48:19.164
for you to give me something,
anything. I don't care what.

48:19.197 --> 48:21.299
That-that little bit of pottery
in your pocket.

48:21.332 --> 48:23.901
It's worthless apparently,
everywhere

48:23.935 --> 48:26.972
apparently, but you still
had to have it back.

48:27.005 --> 48:31.076
And it's a loan of my money,
to me, with interest!

48:31.109 --> 48:32.643
Of course it is!

48:32.677 --> 48:35.713
-Paul, I am trying to help you.
-By burying me deeper

48:35.746 --> 48:37.882
and deeper?
Well, I will not do it.

48:37.915 --> 48:39.750
Do you hear me? Do you hear me?

48:39.784 --> 48:42.553
I will not be buried!
I can't do it anymore!

48:42.587 --> 48:44.089
No! No!

48:44.122 --> 48:46.424
No! No! No!

48:46.457 --> 48:48.459
(clock ticking)

48:59.270 --> 49:00.271
(flicks lighter)

49:10.982 --> 49:12.984
(flicks lighter)

49:19.324 --> 49:21.326
(film projector
whirring, clicking)

49:29.600 --> 49:31.602
(crying)

49:32.937 --> 49:34.772
(sobbing)

49:34.805 --> 49:38.543
(film ticking in projector)

49:38.576 --> 49:40.578
(sobbing):
No...

49:48.019 --> 49:50.955
No...

50:02.633 --> 50:05.770
(sighs deeply)

50:12.977 --> 50:14.979
Yes, sir.

50:15.980 --> 50:17.982
I understand.

50:27.558 --> 50:30.828
â™ª Happy birthday â™ª

50:34.799 --> 50:36.701
â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª

50:38.035 --> 50:40.171
â™ª Happy birthday. â™ª

50:48.346 --> 50:51.216
It's my birthday.

51:11.369 --> 51:12.737
(door opens)

51:24.849 --> 51:26.417
(engine starts)

51:29.287 --> 51:31.756
(applause)

51:34.625 --> 51:36.060
(engine revs)

51:39.063 --> 51:40.064
Yay!

52:37.555 --> 52:39.624
