01:31.920 --> 01:34.960
I ain't nothing
but a wild pig!

01:34.960 --> 01:37.120
You mean a boar.

01:37.120 --> 01:39.250
Hey, girlfriend,
you get that audition?

01:39.250 --> 01:42.250
Yeah, but it was just
another cattle call.

01:42.250 --> 01:44.250
You're my agent, Jerry,

01:44.250 --> 01:45.920
and I want that part!

01:46.920 --> 01:49.250
Why, I was born
to play Lincoln!

01:51.210 --> 01:52.080
Huh?

01:52.080 --> 01:53.500
Oh-- Ouch!

01:53.500 --> 01:55.170
Back off, Rolly.

01:55.170 --> 01:56.380
You're too close.

01:56.380 --> 01:59.920
Oh, sorry.
I'm almost done shooting.

01:59.920 --> 02:01.290
Can we do some interviews now?

02:01.290 --> 02:04.210
-Uh, sure.

02:05.330 --> 02:06.580
Hi, folks.

02:06.580 --> 02:08.500
We're shooting
a little movie here:

02:08.500 --> 02:13.540
The Making of Walt Disney's
101 Dalmatians: Animated Series.

02:13.540 --> 02:18.250
All brilliantly
captured by moi,

02:18.250 --> 02:22.380
Rolly, your trusty
pup reporter!

02:22.380 --> 02:24.960
Lucky:
Featuring
behind-the-scenes action,

02:24.960 --> 02:26.580
never-before-seen outtakes,

02:26.580 --> 02:30.000
and interviews with the stars.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.120
You eat one makeup man
and they call you difficult.

02:34.120 --> 02:36.960
We-- we assumed that
since we were the stars

02:36.960 --> 02:40.120
of the movie, we'd be
the stars of the series too.

02:40.120 --> 02:43.250
Yeah, the studio decided
to go for a younger look.

02:43.250 --> 02:44.500
But we're not bitter.

02:46.080 --> 02:47.710
Uh, yeah, well,
enough of that.

02:47.710 --> 02:50.120
You see, I did get-- I mean--

02:50.120 --> 02:54.420
Rolly and I did get cast
because we were in the movie.

02:54.420 --> 02:57.080
But we had auditions
for the other roles,

02:57.080 --> 03:00.330
and some of the actors
had interesting ideas

03:00.330 --> 03:02.000
about which parts
they should play.

03:10.080 --> 03:13.080
Uh, Roger,
Ra-Ra, babe,

03:13.080 --> 03:16.830
have you considered
auditioning for the role of...

03:16.830 --> 03:18.080
Roger?

03:18.080 --> 03:20.120
Oh, now, where's
the challenge in that?

03:20.120 --> 03:21.580
Trust me,
I can do this.

03:21.580 --> 03:25.120
I am deeply in touch
with my inner nanny.

03:25.120 --> 03:28.330
Lucky, you naughty little scamp.

03:28.330 --> 03:30.670
Give me strength.

03:32.250 --> 03:35.120
I-- I'm gonna be reading
the part of Cadpig.

03:36.290 --> 03:42.040
"Oh, Mother Earth, I am one
with your universal oneness

03:42.040 --> 03:44.830
of being..."

03:44.830 --> 03:46.880
What is this garbage?

03:48.920 --> 03:51.080
Jasper, Horace,

03:51.080 --> 03:55.710
get those puppies,
you mindless macaroons!

03:58.880 --> 04:01.420
I will be auditioning
for the role

04:01.420 --> 04:05.120
of Steven the Alligator.

04:12.500 --> 04:14.670
What in blazes

04:14.670 --> 04:16.620
has gotten into you, woman?

04:16.620 --> 04:20.290
The pig's annoying,
but I like the bulldog.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.960
From the black hole
of eternity,

04:24.960 --> 04:28.750
I am born a runt!

04:28.750 --> 04:31.000
Runt! Runt! Runt!

04:31.000 --> 04:32.670
So I get the part?

04:34.330 --> 04:36.710
That was great,

04:36.710 --> 04:38.670
but what did it mean?

04:38.670 --> 04:41.210
A pineapple symbolizes evil.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.750
I thought it would be cool

04:44.750 --> 04:47.790
if we could get
Cruella to play a part.

04:47.790 --> 04:50.670
-Lucky:
This is the address.

04:54.210 --> 04:57.120
Rolly:
Are you sure
she's still alive?

04:57.120 --> 04:58.790
Cruella:
I told you,

04:58.790 --> 05:02.080
I'll pay the electric bill
as soon as my lottery numbers--

05:02.080 --> 05:03.960
Oh, dear.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.210
Lucky:
The studio wasn't sure

05:09.210 --> 05:11.040
what kind of show
it wanted at first,

05:11.040 --> 05:14.330
so we went through a couple
of different versions.

05:16.540 --> 05:19.920
Rolly:
The first concept was that
the show should take place

05:19.920 --> 05:22.790
in the story's
original setting, England.

05:22.790 --> 05:26.920
It was called
"A City of Two Tails."

05:26.920 --> 05:29.330
Cadpig:
Rolly seemed
like the natural choice

05:29.330 --> 05:31.250
for the lead
in that version.

05:38.830 --> 05:40.620
Indubitably.

05:42.170 --> 05:44.290
Lucky:
But that was
a little too tame,

05:44.290 --> 05:46.670
so we went
the other direction,

05:46.670 --> 05:48.750
an action adventure version.

05:49.960 --> 05:52.620
First Bloodhound, Part Two!

05:55.040 --> 05:56.120
Ha-ha!

06:02.790 --> 06:05.460
You're going down, Windermere.

06:06.460 --> 06:08.120
Man:
Cut!

06:08.120 --> 06:09.830
Terrible.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.460
Rolly:
But the studio decided

06:15.460 --> 06:18.170
that First Bloodhound
was a little intense

06:18.170 --> 06:21.880
for a cartoon, so we tried
an emergency room drama.

06:24.790 --> 06:28.290
(monitor beeps rapidly,
flatlines)

06:28.290 --> 06:31.040
Cadpig:
He's flatlined! Clear!

06:40.620 --> 06:43.580
Lucky:
We tried science fiction...

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
then we tried a paranormal,
crime drama approach.

07:01.380 --> 07:03.460
1973.

07:03.460 --> 07:07.290
Crop circles appear
in Farmer Fledly's north 40.

07:07.290 --> 07:10.290
A golden retriever
refuses to fetch.

07:10.290 --> 07:13.710
Hours later,
three pullets disappear.

07:13.710 --> 07:17.040
Coincidence? I think not.

07:17.040 --> 07:18.920
1984.

07:18.920 --> 07:22.500
Strange lights seen over a coop
in northern Minnesota.

07:22.500 --> 07:26.710
Soon afterwards,
a Mexican hairless
grows a beard.

07:26.710 --> 07:30.920
Two weeks later,
four hens spontaneously combust.

07:30.920 --> 07:34.250
Accident? You be the judge.

07:34.250 --> 07:36.000
1996.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.960
A conical object
flies through frame.

07:38.960 --> 07:41.880
Dalmatians snub local chicken.

07:41.880 --> 07:45.210
A strange slide projector
appears from nowhere.

07:45.210 --> 07:49.790
Isolated incidents
or part of a larger pattern?

07:56.120 --> 07:58.620
Lucky:
Lieutenant Pug
wanted to go with

07:58.620 --> 08:02.920
an old style, macho Western
with him as the star.

08:20.290 --> 08:23.500
Rolly:
We even tried primetime,
cutting-edge satire.

08:28.080 --> 08:30.080
Cadpig:
But nothing was working.

08:30.080 --> 08:32.330
We heard about this chicken

08:32.330 --> 08:35.880
that was just tearing up
the local club scene.

08:35.880 --> 08:38.920
-Thank you, thank you.
Yeah, you're beautiful.

08:38.920 --> 08:42.620
Why did the chicken
not cross the road?

08:42.620 --> 08:45.040
Because she feared change!

08:47.620 --> 08:49.670
Cadpig:
We just had to work
her into the show.

08:51.670 --> 08:54.460
-Hey, who turned off
the color?

08:59.580 --> 09:02.330
Oh no!
Farm noir!

09:02.330 --> 09:03.420
Huh?

09:06.710 --> 09:08.170
Puppies:
Spot?

09:08.170 --> 09:11.920
The name's Pullet Marlow,
Private Chick.

09:11.920 --> 09:14.540
Mystery is my middle name.

09:14.540 --> 09:17.040
I thought it was "Irma."

09:20.380 --> 09:23.420
You want to make
a tape of me

09:23.420 --> 09:25.170
For the TV show.

09:25.170 --> 09:28.250
Stupendously embarrassing
home videos.

09:28.250 --> 09:30.750
Yeah, they're paying big bucks

09:30.750 --> 09:32.830
for tapes of animals
doing stunts.

09:32.830 --> 09:35.790
What, you think I'm gonna
do something stupid

09:35.790 --> 09:36.710
just 'cause you ask?

09:36.710 --> 09:38.620
I'm not a clown.

09:38.620 --> 09:40.710
I have my dignity.

09:40.710 --> 09:42.000
Ah...

10:15.670 --> 10:17.580
Lucky:
Another concept was to focus

10:17.580 --> 10:21.580
on our whole entire
extended family.

10:21.580 --> 10:22.960
All of us.

10:22.960 --> 10:27.880
Each and every
101 dalmatian.

10:31.920 --> 10:34.620
Man: Each and every
101 dalmatians,

10:34.620 --> 10:36.670
act one, scene one.

10:38.290 --> 10:39.880
Dinnertime!

10:39.880 --> 10:43.460
Rolly, Lucky, Cadpig, Patch,

10:43.460 --> 10:45.920
Jewel, Whizzer, Dipstick,

10:45.920 --> 10:48.380
Two-Tone, Hoover, Kirby,

10:48.380 --> 10:49.960
Sa-Sa, Dingo, Boo,

10:49.960 --> 10:53.750
Dot, Lady, Ham, Lugnut,
Plato, Furball, Holly, Steve,

10:53.750 --> 10:55.750
Lumpy, Polly, Lipdip...

10:57.540 --> 11:01.080
That was impractical,
but we kept the settings:

11:01.080 --> 11:03.250
Dearly Farm...

11:03.250 --> 11:04.920
and Villa De Vil.

11:04.920 --> 11:08.080
Cadpig:
We cast Latisha Windermere
to play the villainess.

11:08.080 --> 11:10.380
Man:
And action!

11:11.460 --> 11:14.040
Oh, what a beautiful day!

11:14.040 --> 11:18.380
The sun is shining,
the birds are singing--

11:18.380 --> 11:19.380
Oh!

11:20.620 --> 11:22.580
We're already behind schedule.

11:22.580 --> 11:25.380
Where are we gonna find
a villain at this hour?

11:26.380 --> 11:28.330
Well, I think
I might be able

11:28.330 --> 11:30.580
to stumble through the part.

11:36.500 --> 11:38.120
Cadpig:
We were starting to wonder

11:38.120 --> 11:41.670
if including Cruella
was such a good idea.

11:42.750 --> 11:43.960
Hello, Jerry?

11:43.960 --> 11:46.580
I'm back in business, darling.

11:46.580 --> 11:50.330
Latisha's first scene came off
a bit, oh, how shall I put it?

11:50.330 --> 11:51.580
Flat.

11:54.750 --> 11:55.920
Oh! Ooh!

12:00.710 --> 12:03.580
Next, we tried a classic
cartoon chase approach.

12:38.580 --> 12:39.670
Bok-bok!

13:08.710 --> 13:10.040
Aah!

13:14.120 --> 13:15.120
Bok-bok!

13:18.330 --> 13:21.380
That version of the show
had some funny stuff in it,

13:21.380 --> 13:25.420
but it all seemed
a little familiar somehow.

13:25.420 --> 13:29.380
And Cruella was starting
to show her true colors.

13:29.380 --> 13:32.540
She manipulated Horace
and Jasper like putty.

13:33.880 --> 13:36.580
Jasper, darling...

13:36.580 --> 13:38.580
sugar tush,

13:38.580 --> 13:40.420
yes, well,
I was just wondering

13:40.420 --> 13:43.920
if we could make
this eensy-weensy little change.

13:57.120 --> 13:58.960
We tried a hi-tech approach.

14:00.420 --> 14:01.960
The Cruellanator.

14:03.710 --> 14:05.580
Hair:
Bulletproof.

14:05.580 --> 14:07.420
Breath: Bad.

14:09.620 --> 14:11.790
Brain:
Small.

14:11.790 --> 14:14.540
Small. Small. Small.

14:14.540 --> 14:17.460
Cadpig:
But Cruella didn't quite
grasp that angle.

14:17.460 --> 14:19.580
The Fashionator.

14:34.880 --> 14:37.330
About that time,
we showed some scenes

14:37.330 --> 14:38.960
from the show
to a test audience.

14:38.960 --> 14:41.170
I shall obliterate

14:41.170 --> 14:43.500
every last adorable little puppy

14:43.500 --> 14:45.380
from the face of the Earth!

14:47.290 --> 14:51.420
Spot:
We were a little bit surprised
at their reaction.

14:51.420 --> 14:52.580
Hey, you guys.

14:57.670 --> 14:59.420
Well, that was weird.

14:59.420 --> 15:02.120
And no wonder. Look.

15:03.710 --> 15:05.960
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you...

15:09.960 --> 15:12.040
Have some popcorn, Rolly.

15:14.830 --> 15:16.710
Hey, thanks for throwing

15:16.710 --> 15:19.000
a viewing party
for the first episode, Lucky.

15:21.960 --> 15:24.830
Rolly:
Yeah. You got anymore popcorn?

15:24.830 --> 15:25.830
Huh?

15:28.380 --> 15:31.420
Rolly: Hey, they changed
the credits!

15:33.750 --> 15:37.920
Oh! Where is my newspaper?

15:37.920 --> 15:40.290
Memo to myself:
fire the paperboy.

15:42.750 --> 15:46.420
Looks like they changed
the whole show.

15:46.420 --> 15:48.250
Lucky:
Here comes our first big scene.

15:49.290 --> 15:52.000
Ah, here it is.

15:53.540 --> 15:55.880
It's a show about Cruella!

15:57.620 --> 16:00.460
We're going to make
some changes around here.

16:00.460 --> 16:03.290
First of all, we're changing
the format of the show.

16:06.620 --> 16:09.210
Oh, gee, I'm sorry, Lucky,

16:09.210 --> 16:10.540
but I can't let you in.

16:10.540 --> 16:14.250
Direct orders
from the crazy lady
with the talk show.

16:14.250 --> 16:17.380
Once Cruella had us
thrown off the studio lot,

16:17.380 --> 16:20.380
there was nothing to stop her
and her mad lust for power.

16:21.500 --> 16:23.170
We're doomed!

16:23.170 --> 16:24.790
We'll never work again!

16:24.790 --> 16:27.170
I can't go back
to doing open mic night

16:27.170 --> 16:29.330
on the stand-up coop circuit.

16:29.330 --> 16:31.290
I just talked to our agent.

16:31.290 --> 16:34.380
Cruella's made sure that no one
in Hollywood will hire us.

16:34.380 --> 16:37.500
We can't just let
Cruella ruin our careers.

16:37.500 --> 16:39.790
We gotta get inside somehow.

16:39.790 --> 16:41.500
-Rolly: You guys, look!

16:48.620 --> 16:49.960
Now what?

16:49.960 --> 16:53.960
We've gotta show Cruella's fans
what she's really like.

16:53.960 --> 16:56.750
Hurry! Rolly, we're gonna
need that camera.

16:59.210 --> 17:01.710
Announcer:
Here she is.
Don't adjust your sets,

17:01.710 --> 17:03.290
it's her hair
that's black and white:

17:03.290 --> 17:06.380
Cruella!

17:08.920 --> 17:11.170
Oh, thank you, Horace.

17:11.170 --> 17:13.250
Good evening, Jasper.

17:13.250 --> 17:15.460
Evening, Cruella.

17:17.330 --> 17:20.880
Louder! You people need
to adore me louder!

17:20.880 --> 17:23.380
Ha ha ha...

17:23.380 --> 17:25.080
ha ha ha ha...

17:25.080 --> 17:29.330
Okay, let's go to today's
Three Worst Things list.

17:33.460 --> 17:36.420
And the bartender says,

17:36.420 --> 17:38.580
"Idaho. Alaska."

17:53.250 --> 17:57.120
Oh! Our very first guest
will be on

17:57.120 --> 17:58.380
right after this message.

17:59.380 --> 18:01.040
We're doing good.

18:01.040 --> 18:04.000
"Good"?
I'm doing brilliantly!

18:04.000 --> 18:06.710
And I'm doing it
all by myself!

18:07.750 --> 18:10.120
Ugh. That sponge is too damp!

18:10.120 --> 18:12.170
You're fired!
Get out of here!

18:12.170 --> 18:14.790
You numbskull, what do
you think you're doing?

18:14.790 --> 18:17.500
You're crossing the shoelaces
left over right.

18:17.500 --> 18:20.040
I cross them right
over left. You're fired!

18:20.040 --> 18:22.790
Who hires these people anyway?
After the show,

18:22.790 --> 18:25.290
I want you to fire
the entire personnel department!

18:25.290 --> 18:27.540
Um...
Y-- yes, Cruella.

18:27.540 --> 18:29.710
And then fire yourself!

18:31.170 --> 18:33.080
Who is this
useless guest anyway?

18:33.080 --> 18:35.210
That pop singer Muldoona.

18:35.210 --> 18:36.960
Muldoona?

18:36.960 --> 18:39.080
Why, I have more talent
in my little finger

18:39.080 --> 18:41.250
than she has
in her whole body!

18:41.250 --> 18:43.080
Jasper:
Uh, but your
audience likes her.

18:43.080 --> 18:45.040
Cruella:
My audience?

18:45.040 --> 18:48.250
You mean those vulgar,
boring, lunch-bucket-toting,

18:48.250 --> 18:51.000
nincompoops who actually
come to watch my show?

18:51.000 --> 18:52.420
Are you gettin' all this?

18:52.420 --> 18:55.750
Yeah, just leave it
to the Rolly cam.

18:55.750 --> 18:58.380
But what are we gonna do
with the tape?

18:58.380 --> 18:59.790
Trust me.

19:01.120 --> 19:03.500
Oh, my chair is out of place.

19:03.500 --> 19:05.920
The set dresser is fired!

19:07.250 --> 19:09.250
Well, whoever is in charge
of cleaning the lipstick

19:09.250 --> 19:11.540
off my water glass is fired!

19:11.540 --> 19:14.710
Man:
Okay, we're back
in five, four...

19:14.710 --> 19:17.000
Hello. Welcome back.

19:17.000 --> 19:21.120
Oh, this is so much warm,
squishy fun, isn't it?

19:21.120 --> 19:24.710
Please welcome my first guest,
a fine human being

19:24.710 --> 19:28.250
and an even finer
actress, Muldoona!

19:32.460 --> 19:34.920
Muldoona, darling.

19:34.920 --> 19:37.250
So I hear you're doing a movie.

19:37.250 --> 19:39.330
Yeah, I got a clip.
You wanna see it?

19:39.330 --> 19:41.500
Well, of course.

19:41.500 --> 19:43.210
I just love your work.

19:43.210 --> 19:45.120
I'm your biggest fan.

19:45.120 --> 19:47.250
Muldoona?

19:47.250 --> 19:49.580
Why, I have more talent
in my little finger

19:49.580 --> 19:51.790
that she has
in her whole body.

19:54.330 --> 19:56.040
Oh!

19:56.040 --> 19:59.580
Oh, come on.
I was kidding.

19:59.580 --> 20:01.210
Cruella:
My audience?

20:01.210 --> 20:04.500
You mean those vulgar,
boring, lunch-bucket-toting,

20:04.500 --> 20:07.420
nincompoops who actually
come to watch my show?

20:09.750 --> 20:11.380
Cut to commercial!

20:11.380 --> 20:14.750
You're fired!
You're fired! Fired!

20:16.330 --> 20:19.830
The bad lady scares me.

20:21.380 --> 20:22.920
Cruella Show.

20:22.920 --> 20:24.460
Man:
I am never watching

20:24.460 --> 20:26.120
that show of yours again!

20:26.120 --> 20:29.120
That Cruella,
she ain't right. I tell ya!

20:30.880 --> 20:33.120
Fine. I don't need an audience.

20:33.120 --> 20:34.290
You're fired!

20:34.290 --> 20:38.380
And whoever is responsible
for putting that clip on the air

20:38.380 --> 20:39.620
is fired!

20:39.620 --> 20:41.170
You already fired me.

20:44.170 --> 20:46.250
You puppies!

20:46.250 --> 20:48.420
I might have known!

20:53.120 --> 20:55.040
-Ooh!

20:55.040 --> 20:56.920
Woman:
Now that's funny!

21:07.500 --> 21:08.750
Now!

21:18.000 --> 21:20.330
Dalmatians! Cute!

21:20.330 --> 21:22.250
I want more of 'em, Daddy.

21:23.750 --> 21:25.620
Cruella Show.

21:25.620 --> 21:27.580
Man:
Now that's entertainment!

21:27.580 --> 21:31.040
We want a show starring
those adorable dalmatians!

21:46.290 --> 21:48.920
That's how the show came about.

21:48.920 --> 21:50.960
The network took
Cruella's show away,

21:50.960 --> 21:53.750
but she was
so totally despicable,

21:53.750 --> 21:56.040
they let her play
the villain in our show.

21:56.040 --> 21:58.710
Cruella:
And I really learned my lesson.

21:58.710 --> 22:00.620
I learned cooperation,

22:00.620 --> 22:04.040
humility, teamwork.

22:04.040 --> 22:05.120
Look out!

22:07.920 --> 22:11.790
Memo to myself:
get a heat-seeking anvil.
