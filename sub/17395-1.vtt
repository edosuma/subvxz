00:49.581 --> 00:51.425
Okay, remember what we talked about?

00:51.550 --> 00:53.686
Use the product rule
to find the derivative.

00:53.811 --> 00:55.929
I can't do this.

00:56.955 --> 00:58.157
Hey, Corinne, not now.

00:58.282 --> 01:00.701
Yeah, you can, Simon.

01:00.826 --> 01:02.569
I've seen your scratch work.

01:02.694 --> 01:03.929
Just take your time.

01:04.054 --> 01:05.798
Focus on the equation.

01:08.934 --> 01:10.236
Okay, I can't learn this by tomorrow.

01:10.361 --> 01:11.961
I'm totally fried.

01:14.273 --> 01:16.709
Can't you just give 'em to me?

01:16.834 --> 01:17.543
Simon.

01:17.668 --> 01:19.268
Please.

01:33.892 --> 01:35.202
Thanks.

01:35.327 --> 01:37.763
You can't tell anyone about this.

01:37.888 --> 01:41.133
As soon as the test
is over, destroy it.

01:43.602 --> 01:46.447
You're lucky, that was my last one.

01:46.572 --> 01:47.273
Don't you need it?

01:47.398 --> 01:48.998
No.

01:50.008 --> 01:50.951
Hello?

01:51.076 --> 01:52.753
Laina, this is Dr. Perkash,

01:52.878 --> 01:55.948
your mother is asking to be
discharged from the hospital.

01:56.073 --> 01:57.090
What?

01:57.215 --> 02:02.344
She's not so much asking as signing
herself out of care against our advice.

02:04.656 --> 02:05.891
I'll be right there.

02:06.016 --> 02:08.669
Just please try to stall her.

02:08.794 --> 02:10.729
Okay, guys, time to go.

02:20.706 --> 02:22.608
Hi, there they are.

02:24.610 --> 02:26.553
This is perfect.

02:26.678 --> 02:28.822
Can you take that to the car for mommy?

02:28.947 --> 02:30.683
Mom, what are you doing?

02:30.808 --> 02:32.552
I am checking out.

02:34.353 --> 02:38.866
You know what, sweetheart, I
left your markers in my room.

02:38.991 --> 02:41.594
Wanna go to mommy's room
and go get your markers?

02:41.719 --> 02:43.937
Is mommy coming home?

02:44.062 --> 02:45.662
Yes, I am.

02:48.767 --> 02:52.338
Mom, you need to be here,
they can't treat you at home.

02:52.463 --> 02:54.063
I know.

02:56.241 --> 02:59.245
Laina, can I have a word?

03:00.646 --> 03:03.616
Here, I know it's not all
of it, but I can get more.

03:03.741 --> 03:06.894
Oh, um, no, we're past that.

03:07.019 --> 03:10.297
Her white blood cell count
is not doing her any favors.

03:10.422 --> 03:15.302
And this kind of aggressive depletion
doesn't give us a lot of options.

03:15.427 --> 03:17.162
But she can't come home, right?

03:17.287 --> 03:19.206
She's not gonna get any better there.

03:19.331 --> 03:24.236
I think the best thing any one can do
now is to just keep her comfortable.

03:25.671 --> 03:27.271
I'm sorry.

03:32.144 --> 03:34.213
Can you help me carry my suitcase?

03:34.338 --> 03:35.938
Uh huh.

03:43.722 --> 03:46.300
Hey, I'm gonna make a run to
the kitchen, want anything?

03:46.425 --> 03:47.693
No, I'm good Blake, thanks for asking.

03:47.818 --> 03:48.302
You go ahead.

03:48.427 --> 03:49.395
All right, thanks man.

03:49.520 --> 03:51.120
All right.

04:04.710 --> 04:06.310
Oh my.

04:07.446 --> 04:09.782
I honestly think I've done
that to you like 19 times.

04:09.907 --> 04:12.818
Yeah, well, that's the last time..

04:18.457 --> 04:20.426
I didn't mean it like that.

04:20.551 --> 04:23.337
I just, I don't want to talk about it.

04:23.462 --> 04:24.363
Ellie, no matter what happens, I'll...

04:24.488 --> 04:28.367
I didn't come here
to talk about the test.

04:30.368 --> 04:33.372
Come on, I wanna show you something.

04:34.873 --> 04:36.473
Okay.

04:38.210 --> 04:40.354
Sh! It's a secret.

04:40.479 --> 04:42.079
Come on, Ellie.

04:43.240 --> 04:44.691
Oh my god.

04:44.816 --> 04:46.660
Ellie we shouldn't be doing this.

04:46.785 --> 04:47.453
Calm down.

04:47.578 --> 04:49.178
Live a little.

04:52.991 --> 04:53.992
Ellie, did you bring your bathing suit?

04:54.117 --> 04:56.128
No.

05:05.837 --> 05:07.437
Go on.

05:25.323 --> 05:26.923
What's wrong?

05:29.895 --> 05:32.339
I'm scared, Blake.

05:32.464 --> 05:34.967
Hey, we're in this together.

05:37.502 --> 05:39.338
I'll take care of you.

05:42.107 --> 05:43.684
Hey, Blake.

05:43.809 --> 05:47.813
You know, I think I do want
something from the kitchen.

05:55.520 --> 05:58.231
I found him at the Bilski's pool.

05:58.356 --> 05:59.956
Bilskis?

06:07.165 --> 06:08.834
You want a Pop-Tart?

06:11.036 --> 06:12.636
No thanks.

06:19.311 --> 06:20.913
Some people like to toast these.

06:21.038 --> 06:24.550
But I never have the
patience, you know.

06:24.675 --> 06:26.275
Love 'em.

06:31.923 --> 06:34.735
Did you have fun tonight?

06:34.860 --> 06:37.396
You got anything going on tomorrow?

06:37.521 --> 06:40.273
Oh wait, my god, you have a test.

06:40.398 --> 06:41.567
It's test day tomorrow.

06:41.692 --> 06:43.043
I completely forgot myself,

06:43.168 --> 06:45.304
it's so easy to forget
something like that, isn't it?

06:45.429 --> 06:46.480
I get it.

06:46.605 --> 06:48.205
Hey, sorry.

06:49.541 --> 06:53.946
Look, there's nothing wrong with having
a little fun every once in a while,

06:54.071 --> 06:56.990
but you gotta pick your moments.

06:57.115 --> 07:01.620
The night before a life altering
test it's not the moment.

07:01.745 --> 07:03.230
Got it.

07:03.355 --> 07:04.464
Solid lecture.

07:04.589 --> 07:05.365
Almost done.

07:05.490 --> 07:09.962
Now, I know that you don't really
care what I think about this girl.

07:10.087 --> 07:11.071
Ellie.

07:11.196 --> 07:13.833
Ellie, but she's a distraction.

07:15.367 --> 07:19.412
Now you have tomorrow, and next year.

07:19.537 --> 07:24.109
And after that you have the whole
rest of your life to be distracted.

07:24.234 --> 07:25.834
Don't eff it up.

07:27.245 --> 07:28.413
You sure you don't want a Pop-Tart?

07:28.538 --> 07:30.138
Good night, Dad.

07:31.983 --> 07:33.583
Hey...come here.

08:34.746 --> 08:36.346
No, no, no.

08:38.616 --> 08:40.216
No!

08:44.723 --> 08:46.926
Move along.

08:51.396 --> 08:52.996
Shit!

09:18.523 --> 09:20.934
Hey, Lana, right?

09:21.059 --> 09:22.502
Yeah, Laina.

09:22.627 --> 09:23.428
- Laina.
- It's cool.

09:23.553 --> 09:24.604
Sorry, um.

09:24.729 --> 09:27.099
This is kind of an awkward question.

09:27.224 --> 09:31.303
I was hoping that I could
buy one of your study guides?

09:32.604 --> 09:34.281
I can't.

09:34.406 --> 09:37.117
What do you mean I can't.

09:37.242 --> 09:40.245
I just gave the last one away.

09:40.370 --> 09:41.970
Shit.

09:44.149 --> 09:46.051
Hey Laina, wait up.

09:47.185 --> 09:50.430
So, you and Blake Renning, huh?

09:50.555 --> 09:52.098
No, not really.

09:52.223 --> 09:53.458
He didn't even know my name.

09:53.583 --> 09:55.302
He didn't know your name?

09:55.427 --> 09:56.762
But we've been in school
with him since first grade

09:56.887 --> 09:59.464
and there's less and
less kids each year.

09:59.589 --> 10:01.274
I know, it's pretty tragic.

10:01.399 --> 10:04.803
Geez, well, it's almost as tragic as
being in love with your best friend

10:04.928 --> 10:07.072
who's in love with the guy that
doesn't even know her name.

10:07.197 --> 10:09.516
But that's just something
I saw in a movie once.

10:09.641 --> 10:10.442
Not today, Kellan.

10:10.567 --> 10:13.512
Yeah, you're right, tomorrow's
actually better for me anyway.

10:15.080 --> 10:18.083
No laptops, computer devices.

10:18.208 --> 10:20.193
Hey, what the.

10:22.212 --> 10:23.096
Get back here.

10:23.221 --> 10:25.057
All units converse at the south gate.

10:25.182 --> 10:26.191
We got a runner.

10:26.316 --> 10:27.916
Get that kid.

10:29.494 --> 10:30.829
Heading your way, now.

10:30.954 --> 10:36.068
Whoa, I've never seen a kid
make it past the guards before.

10:36.193 --> 10:37.344
Kellan.

10:37.469 --> 10:39.304
Are you hacking into
your dad's account again?

10:39.429 --> 10:41.029
Uh, yeah.

10:45.844 --> 10:47.446
Bring him down.

10:47.571 --> 10:48.747
You're surrounded.

10:48.872 --> 10:50.156
Move in.

10:50.281 --> 10:52.258
Come up now, on him.

10:52.383 --> 10:53.493
Move in, boys.

10:53.618 --> 10:56.154
So you're going to send the stolen
security footage to the news?

10:56.279 --> 10:57.589
You ever heard of Wendy Banks?

10:57.714 --> 10:58.665
No.

10:58.790 --> 11:00.425
Well, she's a very prominent
news reporter in Austin

11:00.550 --> 11:03.703
and I have her direct, personal,
general inquiries email address,

11:03.828 --> 11:07.374
so I'm sending her hot
tips all the time.

11:07.499 --> 11:09.009
Does she ever reply?

11:09.134 --> 11:10.302
Whoa, I think I have
more than enough questions

11:10.427 --> 11:13.505
to answer today, thank you, very much.

11:31.456 --> 11:34.734
You're gonna be okay, okay?

11:34.859 --> 11:36.695
You can do this, yeah?

11:59.584 --> 12:01.253
Commence lock down sequence.

12:01.378 --> 12:03.122
Yes sir.

12:10.595 --> 12:14.299
Warning, lock down is now in progress.

12:14.424 --> 12:16.502
30 seconds 'til lock down.

12:17.635 --> 12:20.205
Testing to begin in 15 minutes.

12:29.247 --> 12:30.916
Good morning, everyone.

12:31.041 --> 12:33.685
I hope you all had a good night sleep.

12:33.810 --> 12:35.621
I just want you to know

12:36.788 --> 12:40.192
that you've all had a great year,
and despite what happens today,

12:40.317 --> 12:43.395
I am proud of each
and every one of you.

12:44.929 --> 12:50.477
These questions are tough, but
they are not aimed to trick you.

12:50.602 --> 12:52.804
So, focus, take your time.

12:54.839 --> 12:58.277
And no matter how hard something looks,

12:59.310 --> 13:01.280
there's always a chance.

13:02.447 --> 13:04.282
You'll have two hours
to complete the test.

13:04.407 --> 13:05.658
No talking.

13:05.783 --> 13:07.852
Keep your eyes on your own tablet.

13:07.977 --> 13:13.258
This time is an accurate test that
will determine your aptitude.

13:13.383 --> 13:16.328
As you know, all grades are final.

13:16.453 --> 13:19.231
Pick up your tablets and begin.

14:14.052 --> 14:16.888
You have one minute remaining.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.337
Time's up, tablets down, test is over.

15:01.532 --> 15:03.935
Okay, here are the results.

15:13.578 --> 15:15.178
Donald Green.

15:18.483 --> 15:20.994
Come with me.

15:21.119 --> 15:22.719
Kellie Jeffries.

15:24.389 --> 15:26.532
This way.

15:26.657 --> 15:28.257
Marcus Langley.

15:29.861 --> 15:31.304
Don't touch me.

15:31.429 --> 15:32.464
- Come on.
- Don't touch me.

15:32.589 --> 15:34.132
- Hands out.
- Touch me.

15:34.257 --> 15:35.567
Lane Vic.

15:35.692 --> 15:38.011
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

15:38.136 --> 15:40.004
He's on the move, he's on the move.

15:40.129 --> 15:42.107
Hey, get him, back row.

15:42.232 --> 15:44.409
Give him the door.

15:53.451 --> 15:55.051
Carrie Billich.

15:58.156 --> 16:00.058
Come on, it's time to go.

16:00.183 --> 16:02.594
Please stop, please.

16:05.129 --> 16:06.729
And finally.

16:09.167 --> 16:10.767
Peter Strand.

16:15.940 --> 16:17.540
Ellie Harper.

16:20.611 --> 16:22.211
No, no!

16:26.684 --> 16:30.455
Congratulations, you've all passed.

16:32.757 --> 16:35.635
You can go to the rec room now.

16:35.760 --> 16:37.162
Governor, Blake's on the phone.

16:37.287 --> 16:38.871
Oh, good.

16:38.996 --> 16:41.733
Blake, I just heard the
good news, congratulations.

16:41.858 --> 16:45.904
Dad, they took Ellie, she's
going to the thinning.

16:46.029 --> 16:47.629
Oh god.

16:48.673 --> 16:49.849
I'm sorry son.

16:49.974 --> 16:51.109
We have to do something, Dad.

16:51.234 --> 16:53.353
Just make a phone call, you
can say it was a mistake.

16:53.478 --> 16:54.646
You know I can't do that.

16:54.771 --> 16:55.788
Dad.

16:55.913 --> 16:57.182
Son, we all have to obey the law.

16:57.307 --> 16:59.559
No matter how painful it is.

16:59.684 --> 17:03.730
I can't lose her, Dad, I love her.

17:03.855 --> 17:05.890
I'm sorry, son, my hands are tied.

17:09.861 --> 17:11.996
Stay in the line.

17:12.121 --> 17:13.873
Keep going.

17:13.998 --> 17:16.376
Single file.

17:16.501 --> 17:18.101
You, this way.

17:31.015 --> 17:32.016
What are you doing?

17:32.141 --> 17:33.393
Get back in line.

17:33.518 --> 17:35.161
Put that down.

17:38.856 --> 17:41.000
Run, Ellie!

17:41.125 --> 17:42.725
Go, now!

17:45.663 --> 17:46.865
She went down the hall.

17:46.990 --> 17:50.502
Help, help, no, no, no, please, no!

17:50.627 --> 17:52.227
No!

17:54.572 --> 17:55.607
There's nothing to see.

17:55.732 --> 17:56.449
No!

17:56.574 --> 17:58.243
Come on, hurry up, this way.

17:58.368 --> 17:59.968
No, no, no!

18:01.779 --> 18:03.189
Let her go!

18:03.314 --> 18:05.091
Let her go!

18:05.216 --> 18:06.751
No, let her go!

18:06.876 --> 18:08.494
Blake!

18:08.619 --> 18:10.489
Ellie! Ellie! Ellie!

18:28.806 --> 18:31.142
Hey Wade, come on in, boy.

19:09.647 --> 19:11.557
Mr. Glass?

19:11.682 --> 19:13.585
Do you have a minute?

19:29.700 --> 19:32.203
Corinne, watch your brother.

19:36.874 --> 19:38.784
Hi.

19:38.909 --> 19:40.345
I know you told me to stop,

19:40.470 --> 19:43.648
but I made way too much of
this casserole, so please.

19:43.773 --> 19:44.983
Joey, turn it off.

19:45.108 --> 19:46.618
Corinne has to study.

19:46.743 --> 19:49.595
I'm sorry, thank you so much.

19:49.720 --> 19:51.656
Listen, do you have someone
to watch Joey tomorrow?

19:51.781 --> 19:53.633
Because I know of a great day care.

19:53.758 --> 19:55.868
The Consores said they'd
watch him, thank you.

19:55.993 --> 19:57.362
I know it's Corinne's first test.

19:57.487 --> 19:59.664
We're going to be fine.

20:01.332 --> 20:04.235
You know I'm here if you need me.

20:05.369 --> 20:07.706
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

20:42.339 --> 20:44.409
So, as far as tomorrow?

20:45.743 --> 20:48.213
I wouldn't worry about a thing.

21:20.411 --> 21:25.817
If you're watching this video,
then I am no longer alive.

21:30.521 --> 21:32.090
How many sides does a pentagon have?

21:32.215 --> 21:33.299
Five.

21:33.424 --> 21:34.358
What causes disease?

21:34.483 --> 21:36.335
Bacteria.

21:36.460 --> 21:37.395
How many letters are in the alphabet?

21:37.520 --> 21:39.120
26.

21:41.432 --> 21:43.334
Who loves you?

21:43.459 --> 21:46.979
You do.

21:47.104 --> 21:48.940
You're going to do great.

21:49.065 --> 21:50.408
I love you so much.

21:50.533 --> 21:52.443
I love you, too.

21:57.915 --> 22:00.159
Hey, you ready to go?

22:00.284 --> 22:01.884
Uh huh.

22:05.556 --> 22:06.699
Name, please?

22:06.824 --> 22:08.126
Corinne Michaels.

22:08.251 --> 22:10.703
Okay, thanks.

22:10.828 --> 22:12.428
Good luck, Corinne.

22:14.532 --> 22:16.834
Name, please?

22:22.540 --> 22:24.717
You have a sit down with
Greet the Press at 1pm

22:24.842 --> 22:25.877
directly after the announcement.

22:26.002 --> 22:26.919
Great, what about the speech?

22:27.044 --> 22:28.513
We got the revisions this
morning, they're good.

22:28.638 --> 22:29.514
Did Georgina sign off?

22:29.639 --> 22:30.923
Yes, sir.

22:31.048 --> 22:34.319
You're car will be ready for you at 11.

22:39.089 --> 22:41.333
Hey, knock knock.

22:41.458 --> 22:43.102
What do you want, I'm running late.

22:43.227 --> 22:44.996
Not everything I do
has a grand intention.

22:45.121 --> 22:47.098
I just wanted to say hey.

22:48.833 --> 22:50.433
Hey.

22:52.970 --> 22:55.247
Blake.

22:55.372 --> 22:57.809
I wish there was something
I could have done.

22:57.934 --> 23:00.211
But none of us are above the law.

23:00.336 --> 23:02.547
Not me, not you, not Ellie.

23:02.672 --> 23:04.957
That's a good line.

23:05.082 --> 23:08.353
You should use it in your speech today.

23:10.187 --> 23:13.792
Is there anything else
you want to try out?

23:33.377 --> 23:34.278
Hey.

23:34.403 --> 23:36.489
Hey.

23:36.614 --> 23:39.792
I can't believe this is the last one.

23:39.917 --> 23:41.619
I don't know why I'm telling you this
right now but I'm sweating so much

23:41.744 --> 23:43.796
that my backpack is just wet.

23:43.921 --> 23:45.364
That's gross.

23:45.489 --> 23:46.624
I know you don't stress
out about this stuff

23:46.749 --> 23:51.504
because you're a genius or whatever,
but, you gotta be a little bit relieved.

23:51.629 --> 23:53.506
I mean, think about it,
this is the last time

23:53.631 --> 23:55.199
you have to worry about grades forever.

23:55.324 --> 23:56.924
Not exactly.

23:58.035 --> 24:00.479
You know you don't have to
hang out with me, it's okay.

24:00.604 --> 24:02.240
Oh, really, sweet.

24:05.476 --> 24:07.319
Did I get you?

24:07.444 --> 24:09.113
No, you do this everyday.

24:09.238 --> 24:12.358
Oh, well, do I do this everyday?

24:12.483 --> 24:14.560
'Ello, do I look British?

24:14.685 --> 24:16.285
Do I look like a British person?

24:17.688 --> 24:19.899
Out of the way, bitches.

24:20.024 --> 24:23.862
Wade Freeman, all star
quarterback, represent!

24:26.297 --> 24:28.374
How the hell is that guy still here?

24:28.499 --> 24:29.441
Maybe he's smart.

24:29.566 --> 24:30.601
Is this your phone?

24:30.726 --> 24:31.435
Here you go.

24:31.560 --> 24:33.813
Oh, dude, oh here you go, I'm sorry.

24:33.938 --> 24:35.273
Aw man, you're definitely
getting thinned.

24:35.398 --> 24:37.082
Go fetch, bitch.

24:37.207 --> 24:38.807
Closeted smart.

24:45.082 --> 24:47.652
- Commence lock down sequence,
- Yes sir.

24:49.987 --> 24:53.557
Warning, lock down is now in progress.

24:53.682 --> 24:56.569
30 seconds until lock down.

24:56.694 --> 24:59.464
Testing to begin in 15 minutes.

25:01.999 --> 25:05.169
Warning, lock down is now in progress.

25:09.707 --> 25:11.984
Excuse me, Governor Redding?

25:12.109 --> 25:13.945
Increased security
demonstrations in Moscow.

25:14.070 --> 25:16.147
Sir, I think you're gonna
want to take a look at this.

25:16.272 --> 25:17.872
It's your son.

25:30.427 --> 25:31.629
Good morning, class.

25:31.754 --> 25:34.006
Good morning, Miss Cole.

25:34.131 --> 25:36.667
Now, before we begin, I'm going to
show you a really special video

25:36.792 --> 25:40.038
before you take your first test, okay?

25:45.175 --> 25:48.713
This is planet Earth, our home.

25:48.838 --> 25:50.648
See how happy she is?

25:52.583 --> 25:55.186
Well, she wasn't always so happy.

25:55.311 --> 26:00.191
You see, not so long ago, the
Earth wasn't feeling so well.

26:01.625 --> 26:03.728
First, she got too hot.

26:06.330 --> 26:07.732
Then, the oceans started to rise,

26:07.857 --> 26:11.644
leaving less room on the
land for Earth's friends,

26:11.769 --> 26:15.080
and with less land and
more and more people,

26:15.205 --> 26:17.742
there was just not enough
room for everybody.

26:17.867 --> 26:20.953
Luckily, boys and girls
from all over the world

26:21.078 --> 26:24.382
got together and came up
with some very cool ways

26:24.507 --> 26:28.586
to eliminate five percent of
their population annually.

26:35.392 --> 26:37.228
You okay, Miss Cole?

26:38.796 --> 26:40.565
Everything all right?

26:41.832 --> 26:45.803
Because if you are not up for it, we
can have someone else come down here.

26:45.928 --> 26:48.047
No, I'm fine.

26:48.172 --> 26:49.774
Just need a minute.

27:01.618 --> 27:04.789
Some places
say goodbye to their oldest.

27:04.914 --> 27:08.400
Others only let mommies
and daddies have one baby.

27:08.525 --> 27:13.973
In America, what if only the smartest
boys and girls got to live here?

27:14.098 --> 27:17.009
That way, there's enough to go around.

27:17.134 --> 27:20.412
And America could be
the best country again.

27:20.537 --> 27:21.647
Isn't that neat?

27:21.772 --> 27:24.717
Now, all kids from 1st
grade til 12th grade

27:24.842 --> 27:29.047
get to take the 10-241 test to
help planet Earth feel great.

27:36.120 --> 27:39.765
'Kay, now, it's time for everyone
to pick up your tablets, okay?

27:39.890 --> 27:44.662
You have a very exciting test
today, just like we practiced.

27:44.787 --> 27:52.111
These questions are hard, but
if you take your time, and focus,

27:52.236 --> 27:55.139
remember there's always a chance.

27:57.174 --> 28:00.111
Okay, pick up your tablets and begin.

28:01.645 --> 28:03.245
Good luck.

28:05.315 --> 28:10.329
If you're watching this video,
then I am no longer alive.

28:10.454 --> 28:12.756
Today, I will be filling
in enough incorrect answers

28:12.881 --> 28:15.768
to definitely fail my 10-241 examine.

28:15.893 --> 28:18.771
My dad wants to stand by this system.

28:18.896 --> 28:23.234
He's gonna have to stand by a system
that put his own son to death.

28:28.372 --> 28:29.548
I want him home now.

28:29.673 --> 28:31.509
- Sir, we can't...
- I want my son home now!

28:31.634 --> 28:33.878
Testing's already begun, the
school's on complete lock down.

28:34.003 --> 28:35.779
God damnit, god damnit!

28:44.922 --> 28:47.391
Sir, they're ready for you.

28:50.894 --> 28:52.494
Take a walk.

29:19.957 --> 29:21.726
This is Mason King.

29:47.451 --> 29:48.352
Yes, Nathan.

29:48.477 --> 29:49.987
I don't know this one.

29:50.112 --> 29:51.712
Can you help me?

29:58.962 --> 30:01.340
Sorry, I can't.

30:01.465 --> 30:03.867
Just do your best, okay?

30:03.992 --> 30:05.878
Okay.

30:25.022 --> 30:28.349
Time's up, tablets down, test is over.

30:46.043 --> 30:49.947
If I call your name, I want you
to stand up and follow the leader.

30:50.072 --> 30:53.985
We're gonna play a song
while we grade the test.

31:14.797 --> 31:16.448
Nicole Chung.

31:19.101 --> 31:20.701
No, no!

31:23.972 --> 31:25.783
Get off me.

31:47.671 --> 31:49.271
Mark Salazar.

31:50.674 --> 31:52.910
Come with me.

31:56.472 --> 31:58.557
Sarah Foster.

31:58.682 --> 32:00.926
No, no, no!

32:01.051 --> 32:03.454
No, no, please no, don't, no!

32:06.690 --> 32:10.361
Congratulations, the
rest of you passed.

32:12.129 --> 32:13.729
And lastly.

32:20.937 --> 32:22.537
Laina Michaels.

32:26.410 --> 32:28.010
What?

32:30.147 --> 32:33.507
Come on, it's time to go.

32:36.620 --> 32:38.220
Class dismissed.

32:42.159 --> 32:43.435
Is he safe?

32:43.560 --> 32:44.628
The transfer is complete.

32:44.753 --> 32:46.738
Everything is in order, governor.

32:46.863 --> 32:48.974
Mason, I appreciate your discretion.

32:49.099 --> 32:51.743
As always, I need the word
from you to make it official.

32:51.868 --> 32:52.936
Are we approved to
commence the thinning.

32:53.061 --> 32:53.771
You are approved.

32:53.896 --> 32:55.740
Yes, sir.

32:57.107 --> 32:58.707
Good.

33:00.477 --> 33:02.045
Good, are you ready?

33:02.170 --> 33:03.947
Time to sell the dream.

33:27.671 --> 33:32.951
Officer, wait, I'm Kendra
Birch, I'm Laina's teacher.

33:33.076 --> 33:35.120
Laina's the best student I've ever had.

33:35.245 --> 33:38.682
I'm finding it very difficult to
believe that she failed the exam.

33:38.807 --> 33:41.652
Maybe there was a
problem with her tablet?

33:41.777 --> 33:43.829
Do something, please?

33:43.954 --> 33:46.398
Make it right.

33:48.158 --> 33:50.068
Chang, there's a
teacher in the west corridor

33:50.193 --> 33:51.962
who thinks there's a mistake
with a student's test.

33:52.087 --> 33:54.139
Please advise.

33:54.264 --> 33:55.499
What's the name of the student?

33:55.624 --> 33:57.109
Michaels, Laina Michaels.

33:57.234 --> 33:58.936
Look up, Michaels.

33:59.061 --> 34:00.661
First name, Laina.

34:01.838 --> 34:05.476
There's no mistake, proceed, and
don't hold up the line again.

34:05.601 --> 34:07.201
No, I can't.

34:09.279 --> 34:11.822
There's always a chance.

34:11.947 --> 34:14.018
Get the hell out of here.

34:16.953 --> 34:19.723
Let's go, move out.

34:37.306 --> 34:40.652
Hey, congratulations, you made it!

34:40.777 --> 34:42.487
Frank Halloran, EG Electric.

34:42.612 --> 34:44.681
Aren't you Governor Redding's son?

34:44.806 --> 34:48.219
I'd like to talk to
you about your future.

34:50.887 --> 34:52.487
Hey, Clare!

34:59.195 --> 35:00.795
Come on.

35:04.301 --> 35:05.177
Thata boy.

35:05.302 --> 35:06.902
Thata boy, Kellan.

35:40.370 --> 35:43.006
When my grandfather
started at Server Global,

35:43.131 --> 35:45.484
he only worked with
people he could trust.

35:45.609 --> 35:49.646
And I can tell you, today, that he
would trust no one more than my friend

35:49.771 --> 35:55.352
and the leader of the great state
of Texas, Governor Dean Redding!

35:55.477 --> 35:56.620
Thank you, Georgina.

35:56.745 --> 35:58.345
Thank you.

36:00.190 --> 36:01.859
Thank you, thank you.

36:03.026 --> 36:04.828
What a great day in Texas!

36:09.232 --> 36:13.545
Being governor of this great
state for the past six years,

36:13.670 --> 36:16.773
we've accomplished some
pretty incredible things.

36:16.898 --> 36:18.283
We balanced the budget.

36:18.408 --> 36:20.377
We even had a little bit
of change left to spare.

36:23.046 --> 36:30.887
We cracked down on crime by 26%, and
above all, we are number one in education

36:31.012 --> 36:33.624
in the entire United States of America.

36:42.399 --> 36:45.302
Move down the line.

36:48.938 --> 36:50.674
Move down the line.

36:53.943 --> 36:56.221
Our world is crowded.

36:56.346 --> 36:58.690
We had to look facts square in the eye.

36:58.815 --> 37:00.892
- You must be really proud.
- And make some hard decisions.

37:01.017 --> 37:05.389
We had to collectively decide, what
kind of world do we want to live in?

37:07.023 --> 37:10.094
25 years ago, America was in trouble.

37:26.476 --> 37:30.014
Prepare for decontamination.

37:31.347 --> 37:33.017
Remove all clothing.

37:53.203 --> 37:56.715
There are those that say
the thinning is barbaric.

37:56.840 --> 38:00.978
Well, I ask you, is it barbaric
to be leading in innovation?

38:08.318 --> 38:12.923
Is it barbaric to be the number one
most informed and educated population

38:13.048 --> 38:14.648
in 196 countries?

38:17.794 --> 38:19.496
Is it barbaric to be the best?

38:22.499 --> 38:28.380
If you don't work, if you don't
support our great society,

38:28.505 --> 38:31.241
then you are living off the system.

38:31.366 --> 38:32.966
That is a parasite.

38:34.344 --> 38:36.813
And do you know what
we do with parasites?

38:36.938 --> 38:38.849
We wash them out.

38:45.188 --> 38:47.124
Today's average student

38:48.291 --> 38:50.368
is yesterday's valedictorian.

38:50.493 --> 38:51.495
Tell that to Vermont.

38:51.620 --> 38:53.220
Tell that to Oregon.

38:55.899 --> 38:58.710
We introduced competition
in the classroom

38:58.835 --> 39:01.371
and the results speak for themselves.

39:05.575 --> 39:07.010
Put these on now.

39:07.135 --> 39:12.223
Our great country has many
challenges still ahead.

39:12.348 --> 39:13.948
And with your help,

39:15.285 --> 39:17.888
we can take the good
things we've done in Texas

39:18.013 --> 39:21.525
and lead the rest of America
into an even greater tomorrow.

39:29.132 --> 39:31.769
Sir, please, help me.

39:33.169 --> 39:34.938
You know, you
shouldn't be in the hallway.

40:47.644 --> 40:51.546
This hour, this minute,

40:52.582 --> 40:54.959
this moment.

41:09.065 --> 41:11.301
I have looked inside myself

41:12.702 --> 41:16.907
and in front of the people
of the great state of Texas.

41:27.283 --> 41:29.561
No, no!

41:29.686 --> 41:32.255
I came here to declare my candidacy

41:32.380 --> 41:35.692
for president of the
United States of America.

42:05.655 --> 42:08.066
Stay in your seat.

42:08.191 --> 42:09.225
Hey, back to the chair.

42:09.350 --> 42:10.869
Remain seated.

42:10.994 --> 42:12.262
Sit down!

42:12.387 --> 42:13.997
No!

42:14.122 --> 42:16.241
Get down!

42:16.366 --> 42:17.634
Hey you, sit down!

42:17.759 --> 42:19.544
Now!

42:19.669 --> 42:21.271
Get them in control!

42:38.788 --> 42:40.757
System is down,
commence containment mode.

42:40.882 --> 42:43.093
Send Victor Woods directly
to the control room.

42:43.218 --> 42:45.328
We need a full patch of
the electrical system.

42:45.453 --> 42:48.172
Copy that.

43:02.812 --> 43:05.423
Victor Woods,
report to the control room.

43:05.548 --> 43:07.617
Everybody stand back, stand back.

43:07.742 --> 43:09.627
Uh, Victor Woods, thanks.

43:09.752 --> 43:11.254
We've had a minor power outage.

43:11.379 --> 43:14.024
Nobody leave this room
until further notice.

43:22.065 --> 43:23.374
What are they doing out of the chairs?

43:23.499 --> 43:25.769
Some of the restraints shorted
during the power outage.

43:25.894 --> 43:27.737
But we got it under control.

43:27.862 --> 43:29.647
Have you done a head count?

43:29.772 --> 43:31.274
Sir, the door's locked.

43:31.399 --> 43:34.077
There's no way they could have.

43:34.202 --> 43:36.721
This isn't a discussion.

43:36.846 --> 43:38.348
When's the power back?

43:38.473 --> 43:40.150
Power's about 30 away.

43:40.275 --> 43:43.995
The cameras are gonna
need a separate patch.

43:44.120 --> 43:45.720
Just get it done.

43:54.397 --> 43:56.307
Hey!

43:56.432 --> 43:58.743
What are you doing down here?

43:58.868 --> 44:00.244
It's about time.

44:00.369 --> 44:01.738
I called for you 10 minutes ago.

44:01.863 --> 44:02.739
What?

44:02.864 --> 44:03.648
I'm Miss Birch.

44:03.773 --> 44:04.616
I teach 10th to 12th grade.

44:04.741 --> 44:05.675
Wait, why are you wearing...

44:05.800 --> 44:07.710
I just saw a student
go down that stairwell.

44:33.870 --> 44:34.771
What's the count?

44:34.896 --> 44:38.049
There's one unaccounted for.

44:38.174 --> 44:39.684
You lost a student.

44:39.809 --> 44:41.277
I don't know how she got out.

44:41.402 --> 44:42.687
She?

44:42.812 --> 44:46.457
Her name is Laina Michaels.

44:46.582 --> 44:48.182
And where is she?

44:52.221 --> 44:53.798
Blake?

44:53.923 --> 44:55.299
Lauren?

44:55.424 --> 44:57.535
You failed the test?

44:57.660 --> 44:59.704
It's Laina, and no.

44:59.829 --> 45:02.340
There's no way I failed that test.

45:02.465 --> 45:03.867
What are you doing here?

45:03.992 --> 45:05.543
Didn't you pass?

45:05.668 --> 45:07.170
I failed the test on purpose.

45:07.295 --> 45:08.813
You did what?

45:08.938 --> 45:12.609
I put my dad between a rock and a
hard place and he moved the rock.

45:13.676 --> 45:15.612
Something's not right.

45:15.737 --> 45:18.815
Come on, I think I know where to go.

45:27.657 --> 45:32.129
Level four breach, level four breach.

45:33.863 --> 45:35.807
Level four breach.

45:35.932 --> 45:39.410
- Come on.
- Level four breach.

45:39.535 --> 45:41.204
Level four breach.

45:42.238 --> 45:43.273
Hey, hey, come on.

45:43.398 --> 45:44.382
Stay back.

45:44.507 --> 45:45.583
Hey, what the hell's going on?

45:45.708 --> 45:46.809
Everybody stay where you are.

45:46.934 --> 45:49.720
This will all be over soon.

45:49.845 --> 45:52.757
Sir, it's past noon.

45:52.882 --> 45:55.585
We're still in lock
down until this is done.

45:55.710 --> 45:57.395
No one comes in or out.

45:57.520 --> 46:00.423
Parents are already asking
when they'll see their children.

46:00.548 --> 46:03.134
What's the status on
the missing student?

46:03.259 --> 46:04.627
All clear on level four.

46:04.752 --> 46:09.540
I want every teacher brought
to holding room A immediately.

46:09.665 --> 46:11.568
Yes, sir.

46:20.476 --> 46:22.720
Okay.

46:22.845 --> 46:24.848
Where do you want to go?

46:26.249 --> 46:28.860
We need to find where
they keep the tests.

46:28.985 --> 46:29.953
What are you gonna do?

46:30.078 --> 46:32.322
Steal the answers for next year?

46:32.447 --> 46:33.731
Excuse me?

46:33.856 --> 46:36.259
You know, for your
little side business.

46:36.384 --> 46:40.463
Where you sell the answers
to desperate kids for money.

46:43.032 --> 46:44.734
You don't know what
you're talking about.

46:44.859 --> 46:46.511
No, I do.

46:46.636 --> 46:49.973
Innocent kids are killed
to meet a bottom line.

46:50.098 --> 46:53.443
And you found a way to profit off them.

46:55.278 --> 47:00.016
Tell me, Laina, what did you
spend the money on first?

47:00.141 --> 47:02.193
Was it a car?

47:02.318 --> 47:03.987
A nice dress, maybe?

47:06.289 --> 47:07.889
My mom.

47:10.026 --> 47:14.030
We had to figure out a way
to pay for the treatments.

47:14.155 --> 47:19.502
We sold everything we could,
but, it still wasn't enough.

47:20.936 --> 47:23.881
I'm not proud of what I did.

47:24.006 --> 47:26.910
I just didn't know what else to do.

47:28.611 --> 47:31.348
In the end it didn't even matter.

47:34.083 --> 47:38.955
You know, it's funny, every day in school
they teach us how to solve problems.

47:39.080 --> 47:42.993
But none of those answers
are on the real world.

47:44.627 --> 47:46.296
I'm such a dick.

47:47.330 --> 47:48.639
I'm sorry.

47:48.764 --> 47:49.774
It's okay.

47:49.899 --> 47:53.270
Thank you for admitting you're a dick.

47:54.870 --> 47:56.981
I'm sorry, too.

47:57.106 --> 48:02.879
I just always liked you and I guess
I was kind of jealous of Ellie.

48:03.004 --> 48:04.755
You like me?

48:04.880 --> 48:06.549
Liked, past tense.

48:09.885 --> 48:11.655
Now, can you help me?

48:13.089 --> 48:15.499
Um, yeah, I can get
us to the control room

48:15.624 --> 48:17.794
but with the power out
there's not much we can do.

48:17.919 --> 48:19.519
Right.

48:23.099 --> 48:25.302
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

48:30.106 --> 48:32.675
We can follow the network cables,
which will lead to the server room

48:32.800 --> 48:34.318
which runs on reserve power.

48:34.443 --> 48:35.678
Yeah, but don't all computers require

48:35.803 --> 48:38.581
- administrator access...
- Access card?

48:38.706 --> 48:40.306
Come on.

48:43.652 --> 48:44.762
Yeah, we're doing it.

48:44.887 --> 48:47.090
I'm great, I'm glad we could
finally get this on the calendar.

48:47.215 --> 48:48.399
As am I.

48:48.524 --> 48:51.428
10 seconds, 10 seconds.

48:57.166 --> 48:58.868
Got it, thank you.

49:14.183 --> 49:15.952
Key cards and I.D.s

49:24.160 --> 49:25.703
Thank you for joining us, governor.

49:25.828 --> 49:28.431
Thank you for having me here,
Vince, it's a pleasure to be here.

49:28.556 --> 49:29.899
Governor, I apologize.

49:30.024 --> 49:32.343
We're getting breaking news right now.

49:32.468 --> 49:36.981
There is a story developing at Vista
Point High School, right here in Austin.

49:37.106 --> 49:40.610
We're getting word that the
school is still under lock down.

49:40.735 --> 49:43.087
Now, the test should
have ended hours ago.

49:43.212 --> 49:44.413
Parents are growing concerned

49:44.538 --> 49:48.092
as the school is said to be
holding students indefinitely

49:48.217 --> 49:51.587
with no word as to whether or
not their children are safe.

49:51.712 --> 49:56.734
Now, governor, what do say
to these concerned voters?

49:56.859 --> 50:02.421
Well, while, I don't have any
immediate details on the incident,

50:03.799 --> 50:08.079
I can say that we do have the
best team in the nation on site

50:08.204 --> 50:12.550
and that any problems or confusion
will be resolved shortly.

50:12.675 --> 50:16.846
Somebody tell me what the hell
is going on at that school.

50:19.782 --> 50:20.750
It's worse than we thought.

50:20.875 --> 50:22.093
Show me.

50:22.218 --> 50:23.286
Parents have been
waiting for over two hours

50:23.411 --> 50:26.055
with little to no information
on what has happened

50:26.180 --> 50:28.466
to their children at Vista Point High.

50:28.591 --> 50:32.570
We don't know if our son passed
the test or failed or anything.

50:32.695 --> 50:36.140
This day is hard enough for all
of us and we deserve answers.

50:36.265 --> 50:38.042
This community has been through enough.

50:38.167 --> 50:41.779
No parents of students at Vista
Point have been notified as of yet.

50:41.904 --> 50:44.207
We'll keep you updated
as this bizarre story.

50:44.332 --> 50:46.976
Get King on the emergency line.

50:56.652 --> 50:58.252
Key card and I.D.

51:03.559 --> 51:05.495
This is Mason King.

51:55.711 --> 51:58.214
I'm about to have a thousand
royally pissed off parents

51:58.339 --> 52:01.192
talking to news vans in front
of a school with no power.

52:01.317 --> 52:03.861
I need you to explain to me how
this is even remotely handled.

52:03.986 --> 52:05.187
The cables are nearly patched through.

52:05.312 --> 52:06.730
We'll have power back shortly.

52:06.855 --> 52:10.192
As soon as the power is on, the
thinning continues, you understand?

52:10.317 --> 52:11.769
The eyes of the nation are on us.

52:11.894 --> 52:13.329
We have zero room for failure.

52:13.454 --> 52:15.031
Understood, sir.

52:15.156 --> 52:16.507
We'll find her.

52:16.632 --> 52:17.600
We'll find her.

52:17.725 --> 52:19.325
Find who?

52:22.871 --> 52:23.839
Blake!

52:23.964 --> 52:25.564
Blake!

52:31.347 --> 52:32.957
Blake, breathe.

52:33.082 --> 52:34.682
Blake, breathe!

52:54.903 --> 52:57.281
So that happened.

52:57.406 --> 52:59.006
Go put these on.

53:04.913 --> 53:09.619
So, am I going to have to ask you
or are you going to be a gentleman?

53:10.853 --> 53:12.689
I'll be a gentleman.

53:27.436 --> 53:30.106
Do I need to ask you to be a lady?

53:30.231 --> 53:31.715
Sorry.

53:31.840 --> 53:33.042
It's all good.

53:33.167 --> 53:36.913
I got like a three quick
peeks, so we're even.

53:38.313 --> 53:40.724
Okay, are you decent?

53:40.849 --> 53:44.020
No, but I am wearing clothes.

53:49.792 --> 53:53.696
So I guess we're gonna have to figure out
a way to get back up there, somehow.

53:54.830 --> 53:58.301
You do that, I'm going
to go through here.

54:02.104 --> 54:03.314
What the hell is this?

54:03.439 --> 54:05.408
We passed the test, this is bullshit.

54:05.533 --> 54:07.318
I want to go home.

54:07.443 --> 54:08.944
No one has told us anything.

54:09.069 --> 54:11.322
Are we just supposed to
sit here, indefinitely?

54:11.447 --> 54:13.849
Nobody leaves this room
until we get the all clear.

54:13.974 --> 54:15.451
Don't tell me what to do.

54:15.576 --> 54:17.687
Do you have any idea
who my parents are?

54:17.812 --> 54:18.596
I'm leaving.

54:18.721 --> 54:20.321
Stay back!

55:00.229 --> 55:01.829
Shit.

55:31.527 --> 55:32.995
We can't go down there.

55:33.120 --> 55:35.464
There's too many of them.

55:35.589 --> 55:37.441
We need that card.

55:37.566 --> 55:39.502
I don't think we can get
to the computer without it.

55:39.627 --> 55:43.406
Okay, well, there's
got to be another way.

55:45.974 --> 55:47.810
Where are you going?

56:01.857 --> 56:03.559
This is the one.

56:03.684 --> 56:04.927
All right.

56:05.052 --> 56:06.652
You ready?

56:58.347 --> 56:59.947
Perfect.

57:13.495 --> 57:15.239
Blake, hurry.

57:16.323 --> 57:17.923
Go, go, go.

59:17.152 --> 59:18.528
Blake?

59:18.653 --> 59:19.755
You take care of that.

59:19.880 --> 59:21.991
I'm going to the thinning.

59:33.735 --> 59:36.246
Okay, the major networks
should be here within the hour.

59:36.371 --> 59:37.639
I still don't understand
what you'll say.

59:37.764 --> 59:38.916
The press are like sharks, Ted.

59:39.041 --> 59:40.342
They smell blood,
they'll come swimming.

59:40.467 --> 59:44.546
We just need to give
them some fresh meat.

59:47.783 --> 59:50.085
We found him beat up pretty bad.

59:50.210 --> 59:52.554
You got beat up by a girl.

59:52.679 --> 59:54.757
No, sir, well, yes sir.

59:54.882 --> 59:56.482
It was two of them.

59:59.194 --> 01:00:01.505
Two girls?

01:00:01.630 --> 01:00:03.173
No, it was a male student.

01:00:03.298 --> 01:00:04.466
They got the jump on me.

01:00:04.591 --> 01:00:07.136
The other said she was a teacher.

01:00:08.437 --> 01:00:11.107
What was the teacher's name?

01:00:21.416 --> 01:00:23.152
This is ridiculous.

01:00:24.753 --> 01:00:27.023
Yes, this whole thing is.

01:00:28.523 --> 01:00:33.503
I don't know about you, but I
could use a drink after this.

01:00:33.628 --> 01:00:35.228
Me too.

01:00:36.731 --> 01:00:39.568
You want to join me for one later?

01:00:40.702 --> 01:00:42.112
Sure.

01:00:42.237 --> 01:00:43.714
Good.

01:00:43.839 --> 01:00:45.775
I have to warn you,

01:00:46.875 --> 01:00:49.545
I get a little handsy when I drink.

01:00:51.613 --> 01:00:53.716
I can deal with handsy.

01:00:55.884 --> 01:00:58.187
So I'll see you after school?

01:00:58.312 --> 01:00:59.822
I'll see you then.

01:00:59.947 --> 01:01:01.547
'Kay.

01:01:54.176 --> 01:01:55.776
Shit.

01:02:01.683 --> 01:02:03.827
Kellan.

01:02:15.564 --> 01:02:17.164
Come on.

01:02:21.503 --> 01:02:23.172
Miss Birch, right?

01:02:24.306 --> 01:02:26.542
Let's continue where we left off.

01:02:26.667 --> 01:02:28.267
Key card and I.D.

01:02:38.954 --> 01:02:40.554
Very well.

01:02:45.594 --> 01:02:47.194
Key card and I.D.

01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:54.811
I must have dropped it.

01:02:54.936 --> 01:02:56.872
No, I don't think so.

01:02:57.939 --> 01:02:59.474
Excuse me, this is a mistake.

01:02:59.599 --> 01:03:01.199
Everybody out.

01:03:07.349 --> 01:03:09.618
I had it two seconds ago.

01:03:11.253 --> 01:03:12.788
Where is she?

01:03:12.913 --> 01:03:14.513
Who?

01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:19.860
I don't know who you're talking about.

01:03:23.123 --> 01:03:24.341
I'm broke.

01:03:24.466 --> 01:03:26.066
This is the last time
that I'll ask nicely.

01:03:27.127 --> 01:03:28.727
Where's Laina?

01:03:54.296 --> 01:03:55.896
Oh my god, Laina.

01:05:27.088 --> 01:05:30.826
All the information we have as of now
is this morning, approximately 11:45am,

01:05:30.951 --> 01:05:36.062
Laina Michaels, a student at Vista
Point High, failed an exam.

01:05:37.065 --> 01:05:39.634
She then proceeded to
attack several DPC officers,

01:05:39.759 --> 01:05:43.580
injuring two and tragically
killing two others.

01:05:43.705 --> 01:05:45.374
Since then, the
students have been moved

01:05:45.499 --> 01:05:49.578
to a safe place and are being protected
under the watchful eye of our teachers

01:05:49.703 --> 01:05:52.622
until Miss Michaels can be apprehended.

01:05:52.747 --> 01:05:54.383
Corinne, do you need a ride home?

01:05:54.508 --> 01:05:58.520
I would like
to speak to you as a father.

01:05:58.645 --> 01:05:59.429
Come on.

01:05:59.554 --> 01:06:01.564
I understand your pain.

01:06:01.689 --> 01:06:03.833
My son is in that school as well.

01:06:03.958 --> 01:06:08.697
And I will do everything in my power to
bring him and everyone else home safe.

01:06:09.864 --> 01:06:12.034
Blake, if you're watching,

01:06:13.868 --> 01:06:15.468
I love you son.

01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:20.850
This is a trying time for all of us.

01:06:20.975 --> 01:06:24.587
I ask for your patience and understanding
as we move to resolve this matter

01:06:24.712 --> 01:06:26.148
and bring Miss Michaels to justice.

01:06:26.273 --> 01:06:28.684
Wendy, you need to see this.

01:06:31.653 --> 01:06:33.455
This was taken from
inside the high school.

01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:36.892
Yeah, that's definitely a DPC
guard hitting a passing student.

01:06:37.017 --> 01:06:38.593
This doesn't add up.

01:06:38.718 --> 01:06:40.996
Who's the source on this?

01:06:50.505 --> 01:06:55.385
This footage was sent to us by a student
source inside Vista Point High.

01:06:55.510 --> 01:06:57.110
Kellan?

01:07:19.734 --> 01:07:20.877
Hello.

01:07:21.002 --> 01:07:22.637
All units converge to the server room.

01:07:22.762 --> 01:07:24.362
We have her.

01:07:45.727 --> 01:07:46.903
Attention.

01:07:47.028 --> 01:07:51.007
I was just told to move these students
to the recreation hall immediately.

01:07:51.132 --> 01:07:52.868
I didn't hear that.

01:07:52.993 --> 01:07:57.747
The students are staying until
Mason King says otherwise.

01:07:57.872 --> 01:08:02.185
I was just told to take everyone to the
recreation hall without any hold ups.

01:08:02.310 --> 01:08:03.578
So, let's get moving.

01:08:03.703 --> 01:08:05.303
Undo the restraints.

01:08:07.181 --> 01:08:11.253
No, we do don't do anything without
direct confirmation from Mason King.

01:08:11.378 --> 01:08:13.155
Identify yourself now.

01:08:14.322 --> 01:08:15.198
Of course.

01:08:15.323 --> 01:08:17.125
I'm sorry, let me show
you the confirmation.

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:20.160
He's not a guard!

01:08:38.712 --> 01:08:40.223
I have proof.

01:08:40.348 --> 01:08:41.750
I passed that test.

01:08:41.875 --> 01:08:43.952
Congratulations.

01:08:53.161 --> 01:08:55.264
Take her to the thinning.

01:09:24.359 --> 01:09:25.959
Holy shit.

01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:39.874
Good, get him down.

01:09:39.999 --> 01:09:41.984
Get his mask.

01:09:46.781 --> 01:09:49.259
I don't care where you pull the
graphics from, we're going live now.

01:09:49.384 --> 01:09:51.294
Wendy, this hasn't been
approved by the network.

01:09:51.419 --> 01:09:52.621
Karl, it's called
breaking news for a reason.

01:09:52.746 --> 01:09:54.890
We're going with this, now.

01:09:57.692 --> 01:09:59.802
Three, two.

01:10:18.279 --> 01:10:19.948
No, no, not Laina.

01:10:24.385 --> 01:10:27.389
Less than an hour ago, Governor
Redding announced a situation

01:10:27.514 --> 01:10:32.260
inside Vista Point High involving a
dangerous failed student, Laina Michaels,

01:10:32.385 --> 01:10:37.699
said to be wreaking havoc on campus
leaving behind her a trail of terror.

01:10:49.410 --> 01:10:51.746
Just moments ago, we received
official documentation

01:10:51.871 --> 01:10:56.326
from inside the high school
revealing falsified test scores,

01:10:56.451 --> 01:11:02.224
possibly to favor or target specific
students to evade or endure the thinning.

01:11:03.758 --> 01:11:06.235
Among those wrongfully
accused of failing the exam,

01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:09.872
Laina Michaels, received one of
the highest scores in the school.

01:11:09.997 --> 01:11:12.342
Blake Redding, son of
governor Dean Redding

01:11:12.467 --> 01:11:17.272
passed the exam, despite having the
lowest score at Vista Point High.

01:11:22.076 --> 01:11:23.186
Hi.

01:11:23.311 --> 01:11:25.221
I thought you said that you had
the situation under control.

01:11:25.346 --> 01:11:26.047
Well, the situation's changing.

01:11:26.172 --> 01:11:27.223
Yes it has.

01:11:27.348 --> 01:11:29.217
I'm starting to think I
backed the wrong horse.

01:11:29.342 --> 01:11:32.187
Congressman Sandoval doesn't come
with these kinds of problems.

01:11:32.312 --> 01:11:33.096
Georgina.

01:11:33.221 --> 01:11:34.330
Don't Georgina me.

01:11:34.455 --> 01:11:36.966
Fix it or you won't have enough
money to run for city comptroller.

01:11:37.091 --> 01:11:39.761
This explosive
development calls everything

01:11:39.886 --> 01:11:42.731
said today by the governor's
office into question

01:11:42.856 --> 01:11:45.834
and reveals a larger scandal at play.

01:11:49.403 --> 01:11:51.180
This is bad.

01:11:51.305 --> 01:11:52.215
This is bad.

01:11:52.340 --> 01:11:54.342
You got to shut it down.

01:11:55.510 --> 01:11:58.914
Dean, it's over, you
got to let the girl go.

01:12:00.081 --> 01:12:01.750
You need to shut this down, right now.

01:12:01.875 --> 01:12:04.886
Goddammit, Dean, are
you listening to me?

01:12:05.011 --> 01:12:06.996
It's over.

01:12:07.121 --> 01:12:08.957
There's no more moves.

01:12:11.826 --> 01:12:14.437
There's one more move.

01:12:14.562 --> 01:12:16.873
No, please.

01:12:16.998 --> 01:12:18.598
No, no!

01:12:26.007 --> 01:12:28.510
Sir, everything is in order.

01:12:29.911 --> 01:12:33.749
As always, I need the word
from you to make it official.

01:12:34.982 --> 01:12:38.386
Are we approved to
commence the thinning?

01:12:41.055 --> 01:12:45.193
Sir, are we approved to
commence the thinning?

01:12:45.318 --> 01:12:46.918
No.

01:12:48.963 --> 01:12:50.799
There's been a change.

01:12:52.133 --> 01:12:53.868
We need to revise the list.

01:12:53.993 --> 01:12:54.944
Sir?

01:12:55.069 --> 01:12:57.506
That's an order.

01:13:19.060 --> 01:13:23.565
All released students are free
to proceed to the recreation hall.

01:13:23.690 --> 01:13:27.035
Congratulations, you've passed.

01:13:41.983 --> 01:13:43.583
Round them up.

01:13:47.922 --> 01:13:48.890
What's going on?

01:13:49.015 --> 01:13:49.891
Let's go.

01:13:50.016 --> 01:13:50.800
Blake.

01:13:50.925 --> 01:13:51.893
Blake what's happening?

01:13:52.018 --> 01:13:52.802
It's okay.

01:13:52.927 --> 01:13:53.803
No, what's going on?

01:13:53.928 --> 01:13:54.596
It's okay, I did this.

01:13:54.721 --> 01:13:55.597
Get her out of here.

01:13:55.722 --> 01:13:56.506
Blake, no!

01:13:56.631 --> 01:13:57.599
Get her out of here!

01:13:57.724 --> 01:14:00.243
Put me down, no!

01:14:00.368 --> 01:14:01.369
Out of the way.

01:14:01.494 --> 01:14:03.379
Wade Freeman, time to go.

01:14:03.504 --> 01:14:04.547
Get off me, bro.

01:14:04.672 --> 01:14:06.407
Bro, that's my throwing arm, bro.

01:14:06.532 --> 01:14:08.042
Do you know who I am?

01:14:08.167 --> 01:14:10.478
Wade Freeman, you bitch.

01:15:55.016 --> 01:15:55.826
It's all over.

01:15:55.951 --> 01:15:57.927
The school-wide lock
down has been lifted

01:15:58.052 --> 01:15:59.721
and passing students have been reunited

01:15:59.846 --> 01:16:05.026
with their loved ones after what has
been a long, trying day, here in Austin.

01:16:17.438 --> 01:16:20.742
As always, our hearts go out to the
families of the failing students

01:16:20.867 --> 01:16:23.419
who scored in the lowest percentile.

01:16:23.544 --> 01:16:26.748
The head of the DPC, Mason King,
has been taken in for questioning

01:16:26.873 --> 01:16:29.625
in connection with the
altered test scores.

01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:33.429
I am appalled by the alleged
criminal action of Mr. King.

01:16:33.554 --> 01:16:35.924
As of tomorrow morning, I am
appointing a special committee

01:16:36.049 --> 01:16:39.702
to fully investigate what
really happened at Vista Point.

01:16:39.827 --> 01:16:43.406
If Mr. King is guilty, he will
dearly pay for his unlawful actions.

01:16:43.531 --> 01:16:45.633
Earlier reports indicating
a scandal involving

01:16:45.758 --> 01:16:47.977
Governor Redding
falsifying test information

01:16:48.102 --> 01:16:50.505
were discredited when the
presidential hopeful revealed

01:16:50.630 --> 01:16:54.776
his son Blake was among this
year's failing students.

01:16:54.901 --> 01:16:57.512
My son, as much as I love him,

01:16:59.313 --> 01:17:03.693
is no different than any
of your sons or daughters.

01:17:03.818 --> 01:17:05.520
I'm not a hypocrite.

01:17:06.620 --> 01:17:09.031
The laws apply to all of us.

01:17:09.156 --> 01:17:12.093
It just doesn't make it any easier.

01:17:14.595 --> 01:17:16.264
I lost my son today.

01:17:19.366 --> 01:17:23.538
But I know in my heart
that he died for a purpose.

01:17:25.106 --> 01:17:26.641
All of our fallen students have
made the ultimate sacrifice

01:17:26.766 --> 01:17:29.677
in the name of ensuring
a better tomorrow

01:17:29.802 --> 01:17:33.114
and in keeping America's future bright.

01:17:37.685 --> 01:17:42.057
I'd like to take a moment and
thank them for their courage.

01:17:57.872 --> 01:17:59.749
Hold it.

01:17:59.874 --> 01:18:01.474
Okay, they're all clear.
