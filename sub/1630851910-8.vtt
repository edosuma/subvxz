A NETFLIX SERIES

01:05.680 --> 01:08.640
-Everything's going to be fine.
-I can't feel the baby.

01:10.320 --> 01:11.560
It's for the best.

01:17.040 --> 01:18.560
There's a heartbeat.

01:20.560 --> 01:21.480
We have to go.

01:33.720 --> 01:34.920
He's sleeping.

01:36.080 --> 01:38.160
Probably tired after all of this.

01:43.320 --> 01:44.360
Let's go.

02:13.320 --> 02:14.880
Can you take off your shirt?

02:23.920 --> 02:25.720
How did you get that scar?

02:29.920 --> 02:31.920
Climbing one of the antennas.

02:37.200 --> 02:39.600
Nurse, you can go. I'll finish up in here.

02:44.600 --> 02:47.720
Were you treated
at the RARET medical facility?

02:48.560 --> 02:49.520
Yes.

02:50.800 --> 02:52.920
I've never seen
a cross-stitch seam before.

02:57.680 --> 02:59.800
It was an accident.

03:01.320 --> 03:04.800
It's not unusual in this area
to solve problems with guns.

03:06.040 --> 03:09.520
We all had a bit too much to drink,
and the gun went off.

03:10.840 --> 03:13.600
-But it wasn't on purpose.
-This is a small town.

03:13.680 --> 03:17.040
-Outsiders aren't always welcome.
-That wasn't it, Doctor.

03:19.400 --> 03:21.840
Please don't include it in my file.

03:25.320 --> 03:26.160
Okay.

03:29.040 --> 03:30.800
And those wounds?

03:32.800 --> 03:34.320
Were you in the colonies?

03:35.800 --> 03:36.840
Angola.

03:38.120 --> 03:40.880
I was stationed in Mozambique.

03:42.280 --> 03:43.400
In Mueda.

03:45.480 --> 03:48.360
How did you end up there?
Or were you just unlucky?

03:48.880 --> 03:50.600
I volunteered.

03:51.960 --> 03:53.160
Genuinely.

03:53.960 --> 03:55.840
I come from a military family.

03:56.960 --> 04:00.320
I thought it was my duty
to serve my country.

04:01.440 --> 04:03.080
You deserve a medal.

04:03.160 --> 04:05.880
And they gave me one.
It's in a drawer somewhere.

04:09.560 --> 04:11.320
I saw many of these there.

04:12.280 --> 04:13.360
A mortar?

04:14.200 --> 04:15.760
I was the only one who made it.

04:16.280 --> 04:19.520
One died immediately,
and the other had his leg amputated.

04:21.520 --> 04:23.360
I spent many nights operating

04:24.000 --> 04:25.840
with basically no equipment.

04:27.080 --> 04:28.160
No light.

04:29.320 --> 04:33.200
I felt more like a butcher
with a saw in his hands than a doctor.

04:33.720 --> 04:35.880
After a while, you get used to everything.

04:36.400 --> 04:37.960
That's the problem.

04:40.120 --> 04:41.840
We get used to it too quickly.

04:48.960 --> 04:50.600
Can I count on your discretion?

05:28.520 --> 05:30.160
You can see her now.

05:30.960 --> 05:34.480
I want her to stay here for the night,
just so we can keep an eye on her.

05:34.560 --> 05:36.080
She can go home tomorrow.

05:36.160 --> 05:37.760
Are you sure the baby is fine?

05:37.840 --> 05:40.040
As far as we can tell, yes.

05:40.120 --> 05:41.320
But the smoke…

06:30.920 --> 06:32.280
I hear a ringing.

06:33.640 --> 06:35.000
It's from the explosion.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.840
How did the fire start?

06:38.880 --> 06:40.120
We don't know.

06:40.200 --> 06:43.840
Probably from a cigarette
that was left in an ashtray.

06:45.760 --> 06:47.920
Why wasn't it you, Ramiro?

06:49.080 --> 06:51.200
Me? Why wasn't what me?

06:52.680 --> 06:53.800
Who saved me.

06:54.880 --> 06:56.960
I tried to go upstairs,
but the guys grabbed me.

07:05.400 --> 07:07.200
Would you prefer it if I had died?

07:07.720 --> 07:09.600
How can you think that?

07:10.320 --> 07:12.120
What if I wasn't pregnant?

07:16.760 --> 07:19.920
Anne is out there.
She would also like to see you.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.120
Tell her that I fell asleep.

07:24.040 --> 07:25.640
-Don't you want her to come in?
-No.

07:31.520 --> 07:32.960
We'll be okay.

07:34.360 --> 07:35.360
Won't we?

07:39.000 --> 07:40.680
We have nothing left.

07:46.680 --> 07:49.480
I'll call you
when we have the results of the X-ray.

07:50.080 --> 07:52.880
And if everything looks fine,
you can go home.

07:52.960 --> 07:54.080
Thank you, Doctor.

08:43.320 --> 08:44.960
Does your family know you're alive?

08:46.240 --> 08:49.360
I heard a request came from above
to try and get your body back.

08:51.480 --> 08:53.160
The lieutenants were gonna send news.

08:54.320 --> 08:55.680
And I sent an aerogram.

08:59.480 --> 09:01.200
GLÓRIA BULLETIN
THE GUARDIAN OF GLÓRIA

09:01.280 --> 09:03.440
I don't usually vouch for anyone,

09:03.960 --> 09:07.160
but people here aren't the type
to get mixed up in things, or politics.

09:08.120 --> 09:09.520
And Carolina?

09:10.840 --> 09:12.640
Why are you asking these questions?

09:13.160 --> 09:14.720
Do you suspect her of something?

09:15.240 --> 09:17.160
She works at the director's house.

09:17.680 --> 09:21.440
We want to make sure
that we can trust her, that's all.

09:21.520 --> 09:24.360
I can keep an eye on her
if that's what you want.

09:24.440 --> 09:28.360
Do you know if she was ever seen
with someone from RARET? A man.

09:28.440 --> 09:30.440
-She's married.
-She's a widow.

09:32.680 --> 09:35.920
Mr. Ramiro tried,
but he didn't get very far.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.160
And João Vidal
is always very nice to her too.

09:40.760 --> 09:42.240
What do you think of that?

09:43.840 --> 09:45.080
Nothing.

09:45.960 --> 09:48.080
Only PIDE should have an opinion.

09:48.160 --> 09:51.400
I only check them
when they arrive and when they leave.

09:54.880 --> 09:56.920
You look good in the photo.

10:14.160 --> 10:15.000
Well?

10:16.640 --> 10:18.240
They found Fernando.

10:20.360 --> 10:22.000
They found him in the jungle.

10:22.800 --> 10:24.560
Fernando's alive.

10:26.160 --> 10:27.320
He's alive.

10:27.400 --> 10:29.720
-Are you sure?
-This is from the ministry.

10:42.160 --> 10:43.360
He's…

10:44.360 --> 10:45.760
he's alive!

10:51.080 --> 10:52.880
What happened was a miracle.

10:52.960 --> 10:55.520
Your mother thinks
everything is a miracle.

10:56.040 --> 10:58.560
I think it was just bad luck.

10:59.080 --> 11:01.120
The important thing
is that nobody got hurt.

11:01.200 --> 11:03.280
But there could have been a tragedy.

11:03.800 --> 11:08.080
Do you think
it might have been an attack on them?

11:09.360 --> 11:10.280
I don't think so.

11:10.800 --> 11:14.880
I talked to James about it.
I tried to get more details.

11:14.960 --> 11:18.000
Either way, I brought Jaime Ramos
up to speed about all of this.

11:18.080 --> 11:20.400
I trust him completely.

11:20.480 --> 11:25.840
If you suspect any of your colleagues,
you can ask him for their file.

11:26.360 --> 11:28.760
-Very well.
-How long is your medical leave?

11:28.840 --> 11:29.880
I'm fine, Mom.

11:29.960 --> 11:33.080
I only came to show you that I'm fine
so you can stop worrying.

11:33.840 --> 11:35.480
You should come back to Lisbon.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.800
I don't like that place at all.

11:39.520 --> 11:40.480
Not at all.

11:42.560 --> 11:44.120
Was your father home?

11:45.040 --> 11:45.960
Yes, he was.

11:47.160 --> 11:48.000
Why?

11:48.840 --> 11:50.680
No reason. Just that he usually isn't.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
Was it really the doctor?

11:57.840 --> 12:00.080
We know he had an argument with Mia.

12:01.320 --> 12:03.000
That's reason enough to suspect him,

12:03.080 --> 12:05.240
especially given the way
that he left RARET.

12:09.080 --> 12:11.120
Mia really liked you.

12:13.320 --> 12:16.040
She used to say you were enigmatic.

12:20.360 --> 12:22.280
Was there anything between the two of you?

12:24.280 --> 12:25.120
No.

12:27.360 --> 12:29.240
I'm not sure I believe you, but okay.

12:29.840 --> 12:32.840
Women will be the death of you
if you're not careful.

12:37.320 --> 12:39.120
There's a Russian legend.

12:39.920 --> 12:41.440
Koschei, do you know it?

12:42.200 --> 12:43.040
I don't.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.560
I read it in a book of fairy tales
when I was a kid.

12:46.640 --> 12:50.960
It's about a guy
who kidnaps the brides of knights.

12:51.480 --> 12:53.440
Kind of like you did with Carolina.

12:57.200 --> 12:58.600
Leave that woman.

12:59.360 --> 13:01.400
I hope I don't need to say that again.

13:01.480 --> 13:03.520
-I don't see the--
-João!

13:04.240 --> 13:06.040
Relationships make us weaker.

13:06.960 --> 13:09.320
They cloud our judgment.

13:09.840 --> 13:12.280
It's dangerous for you and for her.

13:13.680 --> 13:16.240
A man's discipline
is measured by things like this.

13:16.320 --> 13:18.720
By his ability to resist temptation.

13:20.680 --> 13:22.960
Unlike your father, for example.

13:23.040 --> 13:24.600
What do you mean?

13:26.520 --> 13:28.080
What do you know about my father?

13:28.840 --> 13:30.440
I know a lot of things.

13:31.360 --> 13:33.680
And you could know them, too,
if you wanted to.

13:46.600 --> 13:49.520
-Easy.
-I don't have anything on me! What's this?

13:49.600 --> 13:51.320
I haven't done anything.

13:51.400 --> 13:53.160
-Shut up!
-Please.

13:53.240 --> 13:54.080
Get in!

13:54.160 --> 13:56.600
-No!
-Go on. Get in!

14:10.080 --> 14:11.000
Let's go.

14:26.960 --> 14:28.240
Stay still, damn it!

14:48.400 --> 14:49.480
Listen to me.

14:50.160 --> 14:52.000
I'll tell you what you want to hear.

14:53.880 --> 14:54.880
All of it.

15:01.480 --> 15:03.840
No, I don't want you to tell me
what I want to hear.

15:04.840 --> 15:05.920
I want the truth.

15:07.720 --> 15:09.040
Mia Orlov.

15:11.680 --> 15:14.000
In the report,
you wrote that it was an accident.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.920
That's what they told me to write.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.800
But that was not what happened, was it?

15:21.280 --> 15:24.920
-Did you kill her?
-No. No, it wasn't me.

15:26.600 --> 15:29.360
-So how did she die?
-I don't know.

15:30.120 --> 15:33.240
But there was no water in her lungs. None.

15:33.760 --> 15:37.280
So she was thrown
in the reservoir after she died?

15:37.800 --> 15:39.160
I had more tests to run,

15:39.240 --> 15:41.160
but the Americans
wanted to close the case.

15:41.240 --> 15:43.120
Who wanted to close the case?

15:44.640 --> 15:45.760
The director of RARET.

15:51.280 --> 15:53.160
Do you think they were having an affair?

15:54.200 --> 15:55.280
I don't know.

15:55.960 --> 15:58.280
I don't think so, no. I…

16:07.760 --> 16:10.680
What other tests did you want to do?

16:10.760 --> 16:12.560
Several. Blood tests, for example.

16:12.640 --> 16:15.480
She could have been mixing antidepressants
and alcohol or…

16:15.560 --> 16:17.760
You prescribed her antidepressants?

16:17.840 --> 16:20.840
No. She asked me for the name
of a psychiatrist. I recommended one.

16:22.760 --> 16:24.640
What was the name of the psychiatrist?

16:25.160 --> 16:26.280
Silveira.

16:26.800 --> 16:29.320
Dr. Carlos Silveira.
He works at Santarém Hospital.

16:33.520 --> 16:36.320
-And what was Mia's problem?
-I don't know.

16:36.400 --> 16:38.960
Do you think
she could have committed suicide?

16:39.040 --> 16:40.200
It's possible, but I…

16:40.280 --> 16:43.160
If it were suicide,
why would the Americans want to hide it?

16:43.240 --> 16:46.720
They didn't want the Portuguese police
to investigate things at RARET.

16:48.560 --> 16:52.760
We know you had an argument
with her at the 4th of July party.

16:56.360 --> 16:59.320
Mia found out that I…

17:01.360 --> 17:02.280
Go on.

17:15.160 --> 17:16.840
Are you a homosexual?

17:16.920 --> 17:20.320
-No. No, I'm definitely not gay.
-Why did you leave RARET?

17:28.600 --> 17:29.440
No…

17:49.440 --> 17:51.120
Why did you leave RARET?

17:51.640 --> 17:53.080
They found out…

17:55.080 --> 17:59.480
that I took pictures of women
while they were under anesthesia.

18:00.360 --> 18:02.840
And that's what Mia found out?

18:02.920 --> 18:05.720
She promised me
that she would keep it to herself.

18:06.560 --> 18:09.000
She wanted me
to help her kill the director of RARET.

18:09.080 --> 18:13.000
I think she was with the Soviets
or the Portuguese Communist Party.

18:13.080 --> 18:14.960
But I would never do such a thing.

18:15.520 --> 18:17.320
Do you know what I think happened?

18:18.560 --> 18:20.440
-Either you killed her…
-No!

18:20.520 --> 18:24.040
…or you told James that Mia asked you
to help her kill them all.

18:24.120 --> 18:27.000
-I didn't.
-And that's why Mia died.

18:28.200 --> 18:29.080
Give me the gun.

18:31.640 --> 18:34.000
I don't know anything else.

18:34.080 --> 18:36.640
-I didn't say anything. I don't know.
-Well?

18:59.920 --> 19:01.320
Do you believe him?

19:02.160 --> 19:04.200
He doesn't seem
to have been trained to lie.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.760
Did you see the marks on his neck?

19:10.720 --> 19:11.680
The Americans?

19:12.200 --> 19:14.440
If it was the PIDE,
he wouldn't be here now.

19:18.040 --> 19:20.160
I'll pay a visit to the psychiatrist.

19:20.240 --> 19:23.560
A trained agent wouldn't discuss
her private life with a psychiatrist.

19:25.320 --> 19:26.200
A cigarette…

19:26.720 --> 19:28.400
Can I have a cigarette, please?

19:30.200 --> 19:31.600
Just a cigarette.

19:48.320 --> 19:49.320
Thank you.

20:17.640 --> 20:18.480
João?

20:20.440 --> 20:22.080
What's going on?

20:28.480 --> 20:29.520
João!

20:30.800 --> 20:31.880
João!

22:08.480 --> 22:09.720
Enough.

22:12.200 --> 22:13.240
João!

22:14.400 --> 22:15.720
João!

22:35.000 --> 22:36.560
LISBON

23:39.520 --> 23:41.440
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

23:41.520 --> 23:43.840
I need to speak to Dr. Silveira.

23:45.560 --> 23:48.400
-Dr. Silveira. Do you have an appointment?
-No.

23:48.480 --> 23:50.920
Let me check his schedule.

23:52.480 --> 23:53.320
No.

23:53.840 --> 23:56.760
It won't be possible today,
but he will be available in two days.

23:56.840 --> 23:58.880
I just need two minutes with him.

23:59.800 --> 24:02.520
My friend died, and I know
she was here a few months ago.

24:07.040 --> 24:08.600
I don't remember seeing her.

24:14.360 --> 24:15.600
Have a nice day.

24:19.760 --> 24:20.680
Just a second.

24:27.320 --> 24:28.240
Doctor?

24:29.760 --> 24:31.560
A man here would like to talk to you.

24:31.640 --> 24:33.440
He says he won't take up
much of your time.

24:33.520 --> 24:35.280
-Who is it? Do I know him?
-No.

24:39.800 --> 24:42.080
It seems that one of your patients died.

24:44.240 --> 24:46.120
Okay, send him in.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.360
This way.

24:54.000 --> 24:57.680
Doctor, thank you so much for seeing me.
I won't take up much of your time.

24:57.760 --> 25:01.480
The nurse just told me. My condolences.

25:02.200 --> 25:03.560
Was it an accident or…

25:03.640 --> 25:06.320
We don't know.
The autopsy was inconclusive.

25:06.920 --> 25:09.080
Right. And what was her name?

25:09.960 --> 25:11.760
Mia Orlov.

25:13.360 --> 25:16.680
No. No, she wasn't a patient of mine.

25:18.600 --> 25:21.760
I would love to help, but I don't see how.

25:23.280 --> 25:24.360
Right.

25:25.240 --> 25:27.080
Thank you for your time.

25:28.400 --> 25:30.160
You didn't even tell me your name.

25:45.080 --> 25:46.000
Thank you.

25:46.760 --> 25:48.160
Did you get what you needed?

25:48.960 --> 25:49.920
No.

25:52.040 --> 25:53.880
Have you been working here for long?

25:54.760 --> 25:55.840
For a while, yes.

25:56.960 --> 25:59.600
At what time do appointments usually end?

26:00.120 --> 26:01.440
Around 6:00.

26:01.960 --> 26:03.000
Sometimes later.

26:04.240 --> 26:05.880
Can I ask you out for a coffee?

26:09.320 --> 26:10.440
I don't think so.

26:12.320 --> 26:15.000
I'll take my chances, Lourdes.

26:17.200 --> 26:19.360
I'll be waiting for you outside.

26:41.680 --> 26:43.520
MIA

26:43.600 --> 26:46.440
ARMY MINISTRY
AWARDS AND DECORATIONS BRANCH

26:52.040 --> 26:53.080
When will he be back?

26:53.160 --> 26:55.040
Read the letter. It doesn't really say.

26:55.120 --> 26:57.320
But the important thing
is he's alive and well!

26:57.840 --> 27:01.680
This war needs to end.
And Fernando needs to come back soon.

27:01.760 --> 27:02.920
Yes.

27:03.000 --> 27:06.040
Maybe they'll let him come back
before he finishes his tour.

27:06.760 --> 27:08.120
Let's hope so.

27:12.800 --> 27:14.160
I'm going to church.

30:47.200 --> 30:49.240
You seem more cheerful today.

30:49.320 --> 30:50.560
I am.

30:50.640 --> 30:54.720
For the first time in my life,
I felt really loved.

30:55.360 --> 30:57.080
Was that locket a gift?

30:57.640 --> 30:59.520
-Yes.
-Can I see it?

31:00.360 --> 31:02.280
Are you placing
your husband's photo there?

31:02.360 --> 31:04.280
I know that's what I should--

33:08.840 --> 33:11.640
Please. Leave.

33:12.480 --> 33:15.480
I already told you. Please don't insist.

33:15.560 --> 33:19.800
Ma'am, this is important.
Otherwise, I wouldn't have come here.

33:20.440 --> 33:22.280
Go inside and tell him that I'm here.

33:22.800 --> 33:24.320
I'm sure he'll see me.

33:25.080 --> 33:27.440
I already told you to leave.

33:27.520 --> 33:29.920
-Good morning.
-Good morning, master.

33:30.480 --> 33:32.840
Is there a problem? Can I help you?

33:33.520 --> 33:36.120
This lady wants to talk to the minister.

33:37.240 --> 33:38.520
What about?

33:39.480 --> 33:41.280
I am not authorized to say.

33:42.080 --> 33:43.400
I’m from the ministry.

33:44.720 --> 33:45.920
What is your name?

33:46.720 --> 33:47.680
Rosa.

33:49.040 --> 33:51.640
-Good morning, Mom.
-Good morning, Son.

33:53.520 --> 33:55.920
Wait there. Come on, Alcina.

33:59.280 --> 34:01.200
I didn't know you were in Lisbon.

34:03.760 --> 34:04.840
Henrique.

34:05.600 --> 34:08.320
There is a woman outside

34:08.400 --> 34:11.200
who says she has something
to discuss with you.

34:11.720 --> 34:13.000
What woman?

34:14.040 --> 34:15.320
Her name is Rosa.

34:38.360 --> 34:40.440
Can I get you something, ma'am?

34:42.600 --> 34:43.800
Ma'am?

34:45.840 --> 34:47.600
Thank you, Alcina. No.

35:03.080 --> 35:06.480
If people had any idea
of the problems we have to deal with,

35:07.000 --> 35:09.600
everyone would pity politicians,
not envy them.

35:09.680 --> 35:11.320
Politicians and their families.

35:11.400 --> 35:13.960
Because everything else
takes priority, doesn't it?

35:14.720 --> 35:17.960
I left my cigarettes in the car.
I'll be right back.

35:24.120 --> 35:26.520
Why are you looking at me like that?

35:27.760 --> 35:32.440
Henrique, she looked… vulgar.

35:33.280 --> 35:38.000
I strongly advise
that you tell the people in your office

35:38.080 --> 35:41.560
to be more careful
with who they hire in the ministry.

35:41.640 --> 35:43.600
Madalena, what do you want me to say?

35:47.840 --> 35:48.760
Nothing.

35:49.720 --> 35:51.200
I'm just always amazed.

35:52.400 --> 35:53.720
I shouldn't be anymore.

35:54.440 --> 35:55.280
But I am.

36:30.760 --> 36:33.600
I knew Mia
wouldn't discuss her private life.

36:34.120 --> 36:37.720
She'd only go to a psychiatrist
to have access to his files.

36:38.720 --> 36:42.280
I found several tapes
from sessions with Ramiro's wife.

36:42.880 --> 36:44.840
The doctor records the appointments?

36:45.440 --> 36:46.600
It seems so.

36:49.400 --> 36:52.280
Did you know someone threw eggs
at your father yesterday

36:52.360 --> 36:53.640
outside the ministry?

36:54.160 --> 36:55.000
Students?

36:56.280 --> 36:57.520
Maoist brats.

36:58.120 --> 37:00.680
Here's the information you asked for.

37:06.200 --> 37:08.760
Are you sure you want to do this?

37:09.440 --> 37:10.400
I am.

37:23.680 --> 37:24.800
I need to talk to you.

37:25.840 --> 37:26.720
Open the door!

37:28.400 --> 37:29.400
Please leave.

37:31.800 --> 37:32.880
Are you my dad's lover?

37:32.960 --> 37:35.240
-I've asked you to leave.
-Answer me.

37:36.200 --> 37:37.360
What's going on?

37:40.560 --> 37:42.000
What are you doing here?

37:43.960 --> 37:46.640
Leave, João. We'll discuss this later.

37:50.320 --> 37:51.200
Dad?

37:51.880 --> 37:53.640
Go back to your bedroom, Clara.

37:56.560 --> 37:57.680
Is she your daughter?

37:58.920 --> 37:59.880
Who is this?

38:00.400 --> 38:02.240
Rosa, take her to her room.

38:03.200 --> 38:05.480
Come on. Clara.

38:08.640 --> 38:10.040
You shouldn't have come.

38:10.120 --> 38:13.280
-How old is she?
-That's none of your business.

38:15.840 --> 38:16.720
João?

38:19.280 --> 38:21.840
None of my business?
And Mom, is it none of her business?

38:30.120 --> 38:31.120
João.

38:32.760 --> 38:33.760
João!

39:49.480 --> 39:50.520
Fernando?

39:51.440 --> 39:52.320
Fernando!

39:53.400 --> 39:54.560
Hold on!

39:58.960 --> 40:01.400
Fernando? Let's go!
