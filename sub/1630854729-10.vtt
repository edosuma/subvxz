y'all can hook up and vape.

19:29.836 --> 19:33.715
Fine, here's $10
for some coffee, you prudes.

19:34.966 --> 19:36.426
Well, uh, okay.

19:36.426 --> 19:39.429
What do you say to a bench?
Um...

19:39.429 --> 19:41.514
You were always stable.
You were solid.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.350
Most of all, you were silent.
You never once said,

19:43.350 --> 19:45.477
"Hey, what did you get into
this weekend?"

19:45.477 --> 19:47.729
No, I always knew
that I could come here,

19:47.729 --> 19:51.649
sit down comfortably,
and read my paper,

19:51.649 --> 19:55.987
no matter how much things
changed around here.

19:55.987 --> 19:58.281
And for that, thank you.

19:58.281 --> 20:00.784
- Can I be done now?
- No.

20:00.784 --> 20:02.285
Go sit over there
and keep watch.

20:02.285 --> 20:03.703
I'm taking the Dan Fielding leg.

20:03.703 --> 20:06.122
We'll say it got damaged
in transit.

20:06.122 --> 20:08.708
You know what, Gurgs?
No, no, wait, wait.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.418
Do the other one, too,
because, you know,

20:10.418 --> 20:11.503
I didn't carve anything
on there,

20:11.503 --> 20:15.173
but now I'm thinking bookends!

20:17.592 --> 20:19.260
Oh, that's--
I can't believe

20:19.260 --> 20:22.055
we didn't even make it past
the first mile marker.

20:22.055 --> 20:23.473
Well, that's not true.

20:23.473 --> 20:27.185
When you fell,
your shoe went right over it.

20:27.185 --> 20:29.604
If any part of my spine
was in the right place,

20:29.604 --> 20:31.815
I would hurt you right now.

20:31.815 --> 20:33.775
It was nice that Nina
waited with us

20:33.775 --> 20:35.318
until the medic got there.

20:35.318 --> 20:37.737
Yeah.
Totally ruined her time.

20:37.737 --> 20:40.573
Couldn't have done it
without you.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.409
Can you take your hand
off my shoulder, please?

20:42.409 --> 20:44.285
I can't.

20:44.285 --> 20:45.912
What's all this?

20:45.912 --> 20:48.498
Well, I really wanted you
to at least have the experience

20:48.498 --> 20:49.749
of breaking through the tape.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.001
So I called these guys.

20:51.001 --> 20:54.337
It was too last-minute
to get horses.

20:54.337 --> 20:55.380
Shall we?

20:55.380 --> 20:57.340
Let's do it.

20:57.340 --> 20:59.342
3, 2, 1!
