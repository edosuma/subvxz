WEBVTT

00:02.085 --> 00:04.462
Previously, on
"Below Deck Med"...

00:05.755 --> 00:06.589
I'm taking Storm and my
relationship day by day.

00:08.758 --> 00:11.386
I think everything worth
doing is worth overdoing,

00:11.428 --> 00:13.054
with my work, with my love,
with everything.

00:13.096 --> 00:15.557
I'm excited to see where
this goes--cheers.

00:15.598 --> 00:16.725
Oh, my God, okay.

00:18.601 --> 00:21.521
Well, it wasn't done well.

00:21.563 --> 00:23.565
I think Jason enjoys
upsetting people.

00:23.606 --> 00:24.774
You guys have been
----ing messing up

00:24.816 --> 00:26.192
the bimini for a while.

00:26.234 --> 00:28.778
I just wanna be like oh,
you [bleep]

00:28.820 --> 00:30.071
do your ----ing job.

00:32.574 --> 00:34.534
Yeah, that's why I'm having
a conversation with him.

00:34.576 --> 00:36.411
One, two, three--

00:36.453 --> 00:37.871
I think we might actually
have a late one.

00:37.912 --> 00:41.708
Can we possibly request
some, like, pizza bites?

00:42.709 --> 00:44.753
You are testing me.

00:48.423 --> 00:49.674
Oh, my God [bleep] me.

00:51.509 --> 00:53.261
I wake up, there's not one
thing pulled for breakfast,

00:53.303 --> 00:54.554
the pantry's a mess,

00:54.596 --> 00:56.222
all the décor from
the night is still out.

00:56.264 --> 00:57.682
And I... so, I'm just
getting overwhelmed.

00:57.724 --> 00:59.893
-That's not okay.
-Yeah, I'm a snitch.

00:59.934 --> 01:02.312
That stain has been
there for two days,

01:02.354 --> 01:04.481
and I wanna vomit in
my mouth when I see it.

01:04.522 --> 01:05.857
And the one that's always
in the laundry

01:05.899 --> 01:07.567
is the one that's
always cleaning up.

01:07.609 --> 01:09.527
What the [bleep] is happening?

01:09.569 --> 01:13.198
They're saying how Natalya is
always the one cleaning here.

01:13.239 --> 01:16.451
If Natalya told on us,
I'm gonna be upset.

01:16.493 --> 01:18.912
There's no reason
to betray me like that.

01:18.953 --> 01:21.247
Natasha, can I see you
on the bridge?

01:21.289 --> 01:22.749
Sure thing.

01:37.305 --> 01:38.682
-Hey.
-Hi.

01:42.435 --> 01:44.396
I don't wanna crush your spirit.

01:44.437 --> 01:47.190
You're frigging
awesome at service,

01:47.232 --> 01:49.442
-so that's not what it is.
-Yeah.

01:49.484 --> 01:51.653
It's the filth
that's downstairs.

01:51.695 --> 01:54.614
So, my question is,
at night, when you were...

01:54.656 --> 01:58.535
guests are winding down,
you have two people on service.

01:58.576 --> 01:59.744
-Yeah.
-Is that really necessary?

01:59.786 --> 02:01.663
-Yeah.
-Okay.

02:01.705 --> 02:04.290
We spend time with the guests,
they're requesting drinks.

02:04.332 --> 02:05.709
Like, last night,
I made them some food...

02:05.750 --> 02:07.919
Since you have two,
can't that one person

02:07.961 --> 02:12.298
clean the floor in the pantry
and clean it?

02:12.340 --> 02:14.300
Can't that happen before
you go to bed,

02:14.342 --> 02:17.262
so when I wake up I don't
walk down to a sh---show?

02:17.303 --> 02:19.347
Because that's basically
how it's left.

02:20.974 --> 02:23.184
We just physically
don't have enough hours

02:23.226 --> 02:25.353
to organize and
make things right.

02:25.395 --> 02:26.813
So, last night...
so, for example,

02:26.855 --> 02:28.982
if they were up till 5:00,
within that moment,

02:29.024 --> 02:31.317
it isn't like you're
with them 24/7.

02:31.359 --> 02:34.320
I think it's about
time management, really.

02:34.362 --> 02:36.948
Before you go down,
the floors have to get cleaned,

02:36.990 --> 02:38.575
and that stew area
has to be cleaned.

02:38.616 --> 02:40.326
Yeah.

02:40.368 --> 02:41.411
I don't want you to think that
I don't think

02:41.453 --> 02:42.787
you're doing a good job.

02:42.829 --> 02:44.205
-Your drinks are incredible...
-Thank you.

02:44.247 --> 02:46.666
-Your costumes, your ideas.
-Yeah.

02:46.708 --> 02:49.419
It's just when I walk
down there, it's dirty.

02:49.461 --> 02:51.004
Yeah. All good.

02:51.046 --> 02:52.339
Good, okay.

02:52.380 --> 02:54.257
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

02:54.299 --> 02:55.925
Ooh.

02:55.967 --> 02:59.304
That's really, like,
a kick in the stomach.

02:59.346 --> 03:03.558
But it's my job to
take criticisms like this,

03:03.600 --> 03:06.853
so I'm gonna try my best
and do all I can to fix it,

03:06.895 --> 03:08.772
because I care about my job.

03:08.813 --> 03:10.732
You good?

03:10.774 --> 03:12.233
No, it's just disheartening,

03:12.275 --> 03:13.985
because, like, you work so hard,

03:14.027 --> 03:15.737
and the guests are
obviously really happy.

03:19.324 --> 03:22.452
We're not just cleaners.
So, anyway...

03:27.540 --> 03:30.710
All crew, all crew, we
are going back to the dock.

03:30.752 --> 03:31.920
<i>We can start hauling anchor.</i>

03:37.926 --> 03:39.761
The anchor is home,
the anchor is home.

03:39.803 --> 03:42.013
Okay, great.
I'm gonna get underway.

03:52.857 --> 03:55.568
We're windy, windy today,
so we've gotta lock it in ASAP.

03:55.610 --> 03:57.320
Yeah.

03:57.362 --> 03:58.655
I just hope Jason pulls it
off on the bow, brü.

03:58.697 --> 04:02.492
Let's get in before the storm.

04:02.534 --> 04:05.995
Thirty-five meters,
35 meters starboard midships,

04:06.037 --> 04:07.872
35 meters starboard midship.

04:07.914 --> 04:11.793
Your stern is clear from V3.
Your stern is clear from V3.

04:13.712 --> 04:15.588
The wind, man.

04:15.630 --> 04:19.426
<i>Kick to port so we can get</i>
<i>a line with the bollards.</i>

04:19.467 --> 04:20.927
Four meters to V3.

04:23.471 --> 04:26.433
Mzi, put it down, put it down.

04:26.474 --> 04:29.644
Stop, keep it there.

04:29.686 --> 04:31.855
No, she's good, she's good,
she's good.

04:31.896 --> 04:35.400
V3 is midship, V3 is midship
starboard side.

04:35.442 --> 04:36.985
Stay there.

04:39.487 --> 04:41.906
Clear V3 midship starboard.

04:41.948 --> 04:43.950
All righty, good job, Mzi.

04:43.992 --> 04:45.952
I feel like the deck team's
definitely

04:45.994 --> 04:49.372
made a lot of progress and
we're getting into a rhythm.

04:49.414 --> 04:50.707
Storm is becoming
a really good bosun.

04:50.749 --> 04:52.500
I believe in him.

04:52.542 --> 04:55.628
I think I trust Storm
more than Storm trusts Storm.

04:55.670 --> 04:56.671
Throw.

05:00.342 --> 05:02.469
-Okay, lock that off.
-Yep, will do.

05:02.510 --> 05:03.970
We are square on the dock.

05:04.012 --> 05:05.805
I just need to pull the boat
in with the line.

05:05.847 --> 05:11.019
You did a good job, because that
wind was blowing that bow over.

05:12.562 --> 05:14.147
<i>Storm, the hull</i>
<i>needs to be washed.</i>

05:14.189 --> 05:15.148
Copy that.

05:15.190 --> 05:16.399
Thank you.

05:16.441 --> 05:17.442
[bleep] dude, I'm so over this.

05:20.779 --> 05:23.823
All crew, all crew, meet in the
main salon for a tip meeting.

05:23.865 --> 05:26.451
Copy that, Captain Sandy.

05:30.038 --> 05:31.581
Oh, [bleep], meeting.

05:33.500 --> 05:36.127
All right, everyone, charter
number five down, awesome job.

05:36.169 --> 05:37.962
Yeah.

05:38.004 --> 05:40.507
From the interior to the deck,
when it comes to service,

05:40.548 --> 05:42.842
have we had one complaint?

05:42.884 --> 05:44.678
Not one.
That's unusual.

05:44.719 --> 05:48.515
But at the same time,
we gotta maintain our vessel.

05:48.556 --> 05:51.017
This is $20,000.

05:51.059 --> 05:52.727
Woo!

05:52.769 --> 05:54.604
Eighteen hundred per person.

05:54.646 --> 05:56.022
So nice.

05:56.064 --> 05:57.899
There's another surprise
I have for you.

05:57.941 --> 06:00.819
Because you're doing
such an amazing job,

06:00.860 --> 06:02.570
the owners decided to give
you a day off tomorrow.

06:02.612 --> 06:05.573
Woo-hoo!

06:05.615 --> 06:08.868
Dinner tonight on the owner,
beach club tomorrow, all day.

06:08.910 --> 06:10.495
-What?
-Woo!

06:10.537 --> 06:11.496
Yeah.

06:11.538 --> 06:14.791
Yes! I love it!

06:16.584 --> 06:19.045
Mzi, I personally wanna
wish you a happy birthday.

06:19.087 --> 06:21.131
-Oh!
-Cheers!

06:21.172 --> 06:23.091
-Happy birthday, Mzi!
-Thank you, thank you.

06:23.133 --> 06:25.051
Don't forget,
turn the boat around.

06:29.097 --> 06:30.807
Oh, my God!

06:30.849 --> 06:34.477
I just found the
perfect salter for Steven.

06:34.519 --> 06:35.979
Keep it!

06:41.985 --> 06:43.445
Do you wanna take a break?

06:43.486 --> 06:44.529
Oh [bleep] yes.

06:49.617 --> 06:52.203
I hope we get some
really fun guests next.

07:01.129 --> 07:04.215
This is why we don't
get things done.

07:04.257 --> 07:07.927
You're taking another
two hours in the cabin.

07:12.557 --> 07:13.808
Let's get moving.

07:14.768 --> 07:15.810
Hm.

07:17.854 --> 07:19.814
-I'm out.
-On that note.

07:25.987 --> 07:27.530
How bad is the hull, is it bad?

07:31.910 --> 07:33.078
All right.

07:33.119 --> 07:34.537
Yeah, you keep going, mate.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.046
Storm, can't here.

07:43.088 --> 07:44.964
Two meters to V4.
[garbled radio]

07:45.006 --> 07:46.800
Press your mic and then talk.

07:46.841 --> 07:48.093
Ugh, we're gonna hit.

07:52.931 --> 07:55.725
The minute the sun goes down,
they need to be back.

07:55.767 --> 07:57.143
Sure.

07:57.185 --> 07:58.687
I want Sandy to see that

07:58.728 --> 08:00.772
I'm really committed
to my job, dude.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.232
If I have to sit here the whole
night in this sh--ty water,

08:02.273 --> 08:04.901
that's what I'll ----ing do.

08:04.943 --> 08:06.695
Captain wants the whole thing,

08:06.736 --> 08:08.238
you'll ----ing see what
we can do for you, babes.

08:08.279 --> 08:09.614
Oh.

08:09.656 --> 08:12.242
Jason, Mzi, Court, Storm,
go down.

08:12.283 --> 08:14.160
We have to shower.
We all need to get ready.

08:14.202 --> 08:15.704
[bleep] me.

08:15.745 --> 08:17.956
This is a process.

08:17.997 --> 08:19.541
Really, this grinds my tits.

08:21.209 --> 08:22.836
No, really, I'm over this.

08:22.877 --> 08:25.005
I would never want to be
on anyone's sh-- list,

08:25.046 --> 08:27.007
but I kind of am.

08:27.048 --> 08:30.051
The only way to catch up
with this pantry mess

08:30.093 --> 08:32.804
is not to go on the night out.

08:32.846 --> 08:35.849
I actually don't mind
not going out tonight

08:35.890 --> 08:37.892
and staying and doing
the pantry.

08:37.934 --> 08:39.769
I'm so with you.
I'm dead-ass.

08:39.811 --> 08:41.730
I'd rather make the pantry
clean and tidy.

08:41.771 --> 08:44.733
I care about my job.

08:44.774 --> 08:47.944
We're gonna so late,
it's gonna be so bad.

08:47.986 --> 08:50.613
Nat, Tash and I are staying.

08:50.655 --> 08:51.823
Why?

08:51.865 --> 08:54.034
Because she has
to clear the pantry.

08:54.075 --> 08:56.077
Kyle, stop being stupid.

08:56.119 --> 08:57.704
I'm not, I'm actually
dead-ass serious right now.

08:57.746 --> 08:58.830
That's bullsh--,
it's the crew night out.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.582
Yeah, it's Mzi's birthday.

09:00.623 --> 09:02.334
-Babe...
-That's ridiculous.

09:02.375 --> 09:05.128
It's Mzi's birthday, and
I feel they're being selfish,

09:05.170 --> 09:06.963
trying to act like martyrs.

09:07.005 --> 09:08.840
This is something they
could have sorted out

09:08.882 --> 09:10.342
in the five hours
that they just had.

09:10.383 --> 09:12.218
It's not my fault.

09:14.804 --> 09:17.015
That's absolutely
rubbish, sorry.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.017
I feel like she would understand
if we're going out tonight.

09:19.059 --> 09:21.603
We can do it tomorrow morning.

09:21.644 --> 09:23.688
Well, it's not my fault.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.398
I mean, obviously,

09:25.440 --> 09:28.109
something's really annoyed her
about the pantry today, so.

09:48.129 --> 09:49.214
Coming up...

09:49.255 --> 09:51.383
That is absolutely incredible.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.301
We've got eight yachties,

09:53.343 --> 09:56.763
two of which whose
relationship is just toxic,

09:56.805 --> 09:59.432
four yachties who hate my guts.

09:59.474 --> 10:03.186
What that equates to is
one day that ----ing sucks.

10:09.943 --> 10:12.195
Let's all get started
now while we can,

10:13.154 --> 10:13.947
because then we can at
least go

10:15.115 --> 10:15.448
and make it all better
with a shot later.

10:16.157 --> 10:17.158
Hey, Tash, are you...

10:17.200 --> 10:18.868
do you need help
clearing the pantry?

10:18.910 --> 10:20.203
I mean...

10:20.245 --> 10:21.788
It'll be done quicker
with more hands.

10:21.830 --> 10:23.081
You are such a sweetheart.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.835
It's a bit rubbish.

10:26.876 --> 10:28.169
It's a crew night out,
it's Mzi's birthday,

10:28.211 --> 10:29.212
and you're telling Kyle
so he can't go.

10:29.254 --> 10:30.880
No.

10:30.922 --> 10:31.881
I know chief stew, but,
like, that's a bit...

10:31.923 --> 10:33.508
We have to do it.

10:33.550 --> 10:36.553
Natalya should be thankful,
because at the end of the day,

10:36.594 --> 10:38.805
we're doing
the interior team a favor

10:38.847 --> 10:44.185
by using our fun time
to organize the pantry.

10:44.227 --> 10:48.398
But if she wants to then moan
about it, then I just can't win.

10:50.442 --> 10:52.402
That machine can go,
this black one.

10:52.444 --> 10:53.778
Okay.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.155
-With the lid.
-Yep.

10:55.196 --> 10:57.282
Bye, Storm.

10:57.323 --> 10:58.908
-Hurry up!
-I'm gonna miss dinner.

10:58.950 --> 11:01.119
I'll see you at the bar, though.

11:01.161 --> 11:02.328
All right, text me.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.422
Hello, I'm so sorry, it's just
the four of us tonight now.

11:12.464 --> 11:14.174
How are you?
No problem at all.

11:14.215 --> 11:15.508
The others might
join in a little bit.

11:15.550 --> 11:17.594
-No problem.
-Wow, this is so cool.

11:17.635 --> 11:20.221
Oh, wow.

11:20.263 --> 11:22.015
Ah, lovely.

11:22.057 --> 11:23.892
Shall I start with
some water, then some wine?

11:23.933 --> 11:25.393
-Yeah.
-And tequila, please.

11:25.435 --> 11:27.103
Oh, wow...

11:27.145 --> 11:29.064
whatever he says, goes,
because it's his birthday.

11:31.524 --> 11:34.235
My mom used to make me
do this every summer holiday.

11:34.277 --> 11:36.279
This feels so normal.

11:36.321 --> 11:38.156
Oh, my God,
this is amazing.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.324
This is so cool.

11:40.283 --> 11:41.951
I know.

11:41.993 --> 11:44.037
-I'm sorry, Mzi.
-Oh, my God.

11:50.168 --> 11:51.836
It looks like
it's getting somewhere.

11:53.630 --> 11:55.465
It feels so quiet out here.

11:57.926 --> 11:59.469
You know, it's so sad...

11:59.511 --> 12:00.470
I've spent more time
on my knees scrubbing floors

12:00.512 --> 12:01.513
than sucking dick.

12:03.890 --> 12:05.850
Ah.

12:05.892 --> 12:06.893
It's looking good now.

12:06.935 --> 12:08.353
Pack your bag.

12:09.979 --> 12:11.439
-Cheers, guys.
-Cheers, guys.

12:11.481 --> 12:13.983
-Happy birthday, Mzi.
-Happy birthday, Mzi-dawg.

12:14.025 --> 12:15.902
-All about you, bro?
-Happy b-day.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.532
Get off the boat, let's go.

12:22.283 --> 12:24.285
Guys, it's in a museum.

12:24.327 --> 12:25.328
At this place now?

12:26.287 --> 12:27.372
Is everyone here single?

12:27.414 --> 12:28.998
Yeah.

12:29.040 --> 12:30.375
Yeah, every time I try,
it just doesn't work.

12:30.417 --> 12:31.376
You and Tash are
just friends, right?

12:31.418 --> 12:33.294
Yeah, just friends.

12:33.336 --> 12:35.213
You've gotta remember, I came
in just, like, halfway through.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.214
Yeah, we're just friends.
She's back with her boyfriend.

12:36.256 --> 12:37.507
Right.

12:37.549 --> 12:38.508
I tried a few
different techniques,

12:38.550 --> 12:39.509
I tried to be, like...

12:39.551 --> 12:41.011
Missionary, sideways...

12:41.052 --> 12:42.637
I tried the whole, like,
not being helpful,

12:42.679 --> 12:44.973
like, why the [bleep] should
I help, that didn't work.

12:45.015 --> 12:46.933
It was just sh--
for me too, so.

12:46.975 --> 12:48.309
But still, there's right
and there's wrong...

12:48.351 --> 12:49.394
Yeah.

12:49.436 --> 12:50.895
And to mess someone's feelings

12:50.937 --> 12:52.105
while you've got
a partner back home...

12:52.147 --> 12:53.523
-Mm-hmm.
-...first of all, that is wrong.

12:53.565 --> 12:54.607
Yeah, I've been in
your situation before.

12:54.649 --> 12:56.359
-Yeah.
-Like, and it does suck.

12:56.401 --> 12:58.278
You've gotta realize that
you're worth something,

12:58.319 --> 12:59.362
and that someone can't go around
playing head games with you.

12:59.404 --> 13:00.488
No, exactly.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.199
not gonna be all caring.

13:03.241 --> 13:05.035
Oh, you're upset about
your relationship

13:05.076 --> 13:06.661
with your boyfriend and your
other boyfriend on board...

13:06.703 --> 13:09.205
oh, okay.
No, I'm done with it.

13:11.207 --> 13:14.669
Welcome to Greek paradise!

13:14.711 --> 13:16.921
-Hello!
-Hey!

13:16.963 --> 13:18.214
Hi!

13:18.256 --> 13:19.424
Glad you can join.

13:19.466 --> 13:20.425
This isn't a restaurant, is it?

13:20.467 --> 13:22.052
No, it's a museum.

13:22.093 --> 13:23.094
No, it's just a museum,
they set it up for us.

13:23.136 --> 13:24.512
This place is amazing!

13:24.554 --> 13:26.639
It is so beautiful.

13:30.268 --> 13:31.978
No, but it's just ridiculous.

13:32.020 --> 13:34.022
-Cheers, guys.
-Cheers, everybody.

13:34.064 --> 13:35.690
Happy birthday, Mzi-dawg.

13:35.732 --> 13:39.361
Hey, Mzi, relatively, your
birthday's quite mellow, hey?

13:39.402 --> 13:41.029
I've been with you on
birthday's before

13:41.071 --> 13:42.572
-where you've been not mellow.
-Wait, yeah.

13:42.614 --> 13:44.491
I mean, we are in a museum,
so it's hard to get lit.

13:44.532 --> 13:45.950
[laughing]

13:52.290 --> 13:53.541
Solid, yeah.

13:53.583 --> 13:55.043
Sorry, Mzi, you're, like...

13:55.085 --> 13:56.544
Yeah, you...

13:56.586 --> 13:58.046
You're in-between
in our trifecta.

14:02.384 --> 14:04.135
-Are you drunk?
-No.

14:07.639 --> 14:09.307
You two are gonna
have wild sex.

14:12.769 --> 14:14.729
Appreciate it.

14:14.771 --> 14:16.606
Gimme everyone's white wine
glasses, I'll just drink it.

14:16.648 --> 14:18.983
Here, you can have mine.

14:20.735 --> 14:23.613
You don't have herpes
or anything, do you?

14:23.655 --> 14:25.490
I just know
too many dirty sailors.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.242
I have no idea what
you're saying to us.

14:27.283 --> 14:28.576
Yeah, let's go.

14:28.618 --> 14:30.745
It was gnarly.

14:30.787 --> 14:32.455
I can't say sh--
around here, you guys.

14:32.497 --> 14:34.124
Everyone gets offended.

14:34.165 --> 14:36.126
It's just a very different...

14:36.167 --> 14:38.628
Speak freely, I'm not
gonna take offense.

14:38.670 --> 14:41.506
You're one of the few
I have not had to apologize to.

14:44.050 --> 14:45.135
Yeah.

14:46.302 --> 14:48.221
Thank you.

14:48.263 --> 14:50.181
That's my whole thing, is,
like, the whole team.

14:50.223 --> 14:51.474
It's like there's
no ----ing team,

14:51.516 --> 14:53.560
just a bunch of selfish
mother----ers.

14:53.601 --> 14:55.270
Personal opinion.

14:57.272 --> 14:58.648
Okay, let's go.
Let's pop, let's bounce.

14:58.690 --> 15:00.316
Take your lighter.

15:00.358 --> 15:02.235
My relationships with the
deck crew are just...

15:02.277 --> 15:04.070
they are coworkers.

15:04.112 --> 15:05.613
It kinda reminds me of back
when I was working at a desk.

15:05.655 --> 15:07.532
I would avoid every
corporate event,

15:07.574 --> 15:10.076
and yet I had better
friendships with them

15:10.118 --> 15:11.453
than I do these mother----ers.

15:14.456 --> 15:16.041
Woo-hoo!

15:25.633 --> 15:26.676
There we are.

15:45.487 --> 15:47.655
For me, pick-up lines
don't work.

15:47.697 --> 15:50.408
Try to make, like...
make the eyes.

15:52.577 --> 15:53.620
It's like...

15:58.249 --> 16:00.335
Show intent with eye contact.

16:00.377 --> 16:01.795
You can sort of gauge a vibe,

16:01.836 --> 16:04.297
and then from there,
like, we're engaged.

16:04.339 --> 16:06.299
Like, this is working.

16:13.723 --> 16:15.433
Mzi, happy birthday.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.225
Head in the car, mate!

17:02.439 --> 17:03.648
No, I'm sad.

17:04.607 --> 17:07.152
Okay.

17:07.193 --> 17:09.612
* You keep
pushing me aside *

17:09.654 --> 17:11.364
Keep going, keep going.

17:15.660 --> 17:16.661
Oh, that's my balls.

17:16.703 --> 17:18.747
Is Jason all right?

17:18.788 --> 17:19.831
He seems a bit, like...

17:24.502 --> 17:26.504
Who am I, on a day off,

17:26.546 --> 17:28.298
to pull him aside
in front of the crew,

17:28.340 --> 17:29.591
whilst everyone's
having a good time?

17:29.632 --> 17:30.800
Because I think
Jason's personality,

17:30.842 --> 17:32.802
that would ruin his day
and cause drama.

17:32.844 --> 17:34.637
Like, let him have his day off.

17:34.679 --> 17:36.973
Let him have a good time, and
then come back to the boat,

17:37.015 --> 17:38.641
we're back in a work setting.

17:38.683 --> 17:40.769
I'm gonna do it then.

17:40.810 --> 17:42.979
Your vagina is sticking out,
are you kidding me right now?

17:43.021 --> 17:44.522
No, it's not.

17:44.564 --> 17:45.732
Go, stop flashing me, ah!

17:45.774 --> 17:46.733
I was not flashing you.

17:46.775 --> 17:48.651
[laughing]

17:51.363 --> 17:52.947
I'm proud of this pantry.

17:52.989 --> 17:54.824
Actually, this is the cleanest
that has ever been,

17:54.866 --> 17:56.326
and it's still a mess.

17:56.368 --> 17:57.744
Are you guys dating?

17:57.786 --> 17:59.245
-Yes.
-No.

17:59.287 --> 18:00.372
-Yes, we are.
-Yeah, we're dating.

18:00.413 --> 18:01.915
For a couple of weeks now.

18:01.956 --> 18:03.416
We're... yeah... There was
a bad period, you know?

18:03.458 --> 18:05.251
Well, you know, as
I say to my friend,

18:05.293 --> 18:07.337
I'm a very ugly person, and...

18:07.379 --> 18:08.838
No, I love that.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.715
You know, I'm married,
I'm not dead.

18:13.343 --> 18:16.262
What is going on here?

18:16.304 --> 18:18.556
-All right, so...
-Oh, you are.

18:21.434 --> 18:22.727
Right.

18:23.895 --> 18:26.731
Mariana, bye forever.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.483
Like, when did you get
a husband all of a sudden?

18:28.525 --> 18:30.735
Just a bit shocked
at the moment.

18:33.738 --> 18:35.365
Love you, bye!

18:38.785 --> 18:40.537
-Mzi!
-First of all...

18:42.622 --> 18:44.541
-Always.
-Honey.

18:44.582 --> 18:45.583
No, you are!

18:47.502 --> 18:50.255
Break it up.

18:50.296 --> 18:51.673
Okay.

18:53.883 --> 18:56.386
Because I was about to open up.

18:56.428 --> 18:58.263
There's a hand signal for,
like [grunts].

19:00.056 --> 19:01.266
Dave?

19:02.684 --> 19:04.019
-Dave?
-Dave?

19:04.060 --> 19:05.478
-Yeah?
-Come on, we're at the boat.

19:05.520 --> 19:07.731
Come on, geezer.

19:07.772 --> 19:08.982
Where's the ladies?

19:09.024 --> 19:10.400
They've gone to
change in pajamas.

19:10.442 --> 19:11.401
I thought you guys had gone.

19:11.443 --> 19:12.402
I bought her a present.

19:12.444 --> 19:13.403
-What'd you buy?
-Oh!

19:13.445 --> 19:14.821
Mm.

19:14.863 --> 19:16.072
I got her a watch.

19:16.114 --> 19:17.782
-No.
-Are you joking?

19:17.824 --> 19:19.325
I'm serious.

19:19.367 --> 19:21.286
No way, when did you
get that, and where?

19:22.662 --> 19:24.789
I'm very sneaky.

19:24.831 --> 19:27.792
Storm! Stop it!

19:27.834 --> 19:30.628
[gasps]

19:30.670 --> 19:32.464
Whoa...

19:32.505 --> 19:35.425
This is actually something he
invested time and money in,

19:35.467 --> 19:36.718
and some thought in the process.

19:36.760 --> 19:38.720
But I personally wouldn't

19:38.762 --> 19:43.350
purchase anybody a material item
until I really get to know them,

19:43.391 --> 19:45.435
but not my monkey,
not my circus, honey.

19:45.477 --> 19:47.312
[laughing]

19:48.063 --> 19:49.981
Ah, God.

19:50.023 --> 19:51.441
-You are too much.
-I wanna see it.

19:51.483 --> 19:52.692
I wanna be a witness
to all of this.

19:52.734 --> 19:54.778
Storm?

19:54.819 --> 19:56.738
Yes, darling?

19:56.780 --> 19:57.906
I'm gonna give you
a present now.

20:01.034 --> 20:02.535
What is that?

20:05.497 --> 20:06.956
Coming up...

20:06.998 --> 20:07.957
Jason, can we have a quick chat?

20:07.999 --> 20:09.834
Yep.

20:09.876 --> 20:12.629
Hopefully he just takes it well
and doesn't be Jason, I guess.

20:12.671 --> 20:14.130
There's a lot of tension
between you and I

20:14.172 --> 20:15.674
and between you and the crew.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.801
I need you to show me
that you wanna be here.

20:17.842 --> 20:19.511
-Replace me.
-No, that's...

20:27.852 --> 20:29.104
I've brought your
present for you.

20:30.772 --> 20:32.190
Oh sh--.

20:32.232 --> 20:33.191
What is that?

20:33.233 --> 20:34.192
This is your prezzie.

20:34.234 --> 20:35.568
Why are you buying me presents?

20:35.610 --> 20:37.862
Open it up!
Stop it.

20:37.904 --> 20:39.489
-Take it back.
-No, no...

20:39.531 --> 20:41.741
Look, my hands are
behind my back.

20:43.535 --> 20:47.080
Why did you buy me a present?

20:47.122 --> 20:48.915
You're honestly
an ungrateful ho.

20:48.957 --> 20:50.166
Like asking so many questions
instead of saying "thank you."

20:50.208 --> 20:52.752
Bitch.

20:52.794 --> 20:54.462
Woo!

20:54.504 --> 20:55.714
You've gotta start
facing your feelings

20:55.755 --> 20:56.881
and realize this is
what you need.

20:56.923 --> 20:58.800
Stop rejecting the heart.

20:58.842 --> 21:01.011
Why'd you buy me a watch?

21:01.052 --> 21:04.597
It's just my version
of giving you some love.

21:04.639 --> 21:07.934
I'm gonna go, "Hey, guys,
it's 2:00 in the afternoon."

21:07.976 --> 21:10.061
"Time to hydrate, everyone!"

21:11.563 --> 21:13.189
Oh!

21:14.858 --> 21:16.818
Don't you look like
a piece of cake?

21:21.823 --> 21:23.616
What are you even talking about?

21:23.658 --> 21:25.201
Oh, yeah, she was married.

21:25.243 --> 21:27.037
-No, you're not, mate.
-These people are so weird.

21:29.956 --> 21:32.667
[bleep] I don't wanna
expose anybody.

21:35.962 --> 21:37.922
Okay, you're insane.

21:45.764 --> 21:47.265
Like, the exact same...

21:54.898 --> 21:56.691
Come back, Kyle!

21:56.733 --> 22:00.195
With Storm, I think
it's getting intense too soon.

22:00.236 --> 22:02.655
Like, honestly, I don't
think relationships last,

22:02.697 --> 22:04.240
because I don't...

22:04.282 --> 22:05.950
I've never been around
relationships that have lasted.

22:05.992 --> 22:08.620
My parents divorced when I was,
I think, I guess, six.

22:08.661 --> 22:10.663
One day, Mum just moved out,
and she's like,

22:10.705 --> 22:13.124
"Oh, I've moved out because
your dad's snoring."

22:13.166 --> 22:15.251
And then one week later,
my older brother was like,

22:15.293 --> 22:17.337
"Yeah, they're divorced,
are you an idiot?"

22:17.379 --> 22:18.963
"Like, they're breaking up."

22:19.005 --> 22:20.882
So, I just see it as, like,
you meet someone,

22:20.924 --> 22:23.843
you might love them then and
there, but to me, it's just...

22:23.885 --> 22:26.012
I just think it's a short
and sweet thing, always.

22:31.309 --> 22:32.936
I'm gonna carry you to bed.

22:32.977 --> 22:35.605
Bedtime, sleep?

22:36.690 --> 22:38.316
Oh!

22:38.358 --> 22:39.567
Ha.

22:41.611 --> 22:43.029
Whoa.

22:43.071 --> 22:44.656
Thanks so much.

22:49.077 --> 22:51.162
Ooh, God.

22:51.204 --> 22:54.874
Wait till you see this message,
you're gonna die.

22:54.916 --> 22:57.210
I hate you.
I hate you.

22:57.252 --> 23:00.171
It's from Frank,
in capital letters.

23:00.213 --> 23:04.259
Okay, wait.

23:04.300 --> 23:06.302
Pics, let's send him one back.

23:06.344 --> 23:09.597
Miss you so much, I'm actually
texting you back now.

23:09.639 --> 23:13.059
We can't wait to see you
and have your babies.

23:13.101 --> 23:15.103
You just want babies.

23:20.150 --> 23:22.110
[bleep]

23:26.990 --> 23:28.033
Ooh...

23:39.127 --> 23:41.296
I gave Nat a watch last night.

23:41.338 --> 23:43.631
-Eh?
-Yeah.

23:45.091 --> 23:46.843
Ugh!

23:55.352 --> 23:57.395
Oh, Storm.

23:57.437 --> 24:00.106
Nat is beautiful and
wonderful in every aspect.

24:00.148 --> 24:01.816
Like, she's so full of attitude,

24:01.858 --> 24:05.028
and she's ----ing crazy,
but I like it.

24:05.070 --> 24:07.322
I feel crazy
that he bought me this watch.

24:07.364 --> 24:09.032
It's not a cheap watch.

24:09.074 --> 24:10.950
She's just been someone
who's just grounded me

24:10.992 --> 24:13.119
whilst everything's been,
like, so intense.

24:13.161 --> 24:14.662
It's still very early
in the relationship,

24:14.704 --> 24:17.290
but it's just how I am, dude.

24:19.167 --> 24:20.794
Mimosa breakfast?

24:20.835 --> 24:24.756
Woo!

24:32.389 --> 24:35.141
We're gonna dance, day-drink,
go out, and have fun.

24:35.183 --> 24:37.143
Yay, yay, yay!
Oh, look at you!

24:37.185 --> 24:38.311
Rawr.

24:38.353 --> 24:40.897
-Throw pennies.
-Let's go.

24:40.939 --> 24:41.981
Sexy!

24:42.023 --> 24:43.858
Oh, you're looking great.

24:43.900 --> 24:45.026
Thanks.

24:45.068 --> 24:46.236
Do I shut the door?

24:46.277 --> 24:48.321
I'll shut it for you.

24:48.363 --> 24:49.322
It's all right, I'm capable,
thank you.

24:49.364 --> 24:50.824
I know you are.

24:50.865 --> 24:53.284
-Whoa, someone's drinking.
-Damn!

24:53.326 --> 24:55.829
I'm going to go to Mexico.

24:55.870 --> 24:57.330
You're going to Mexico as well.

24:57.372 --> 24:59.499
Come to stop off
in...

24:59.541 --> 25:02.836
I'll take you on the best trip
of your life, promise you.

25:02.877 --> 25:04.379
I was thinking about asking you.

25:04.421 --> 25:06.256
Possibly.

25:06.297 --> 25:08.049
You're thinking about asking
me to come to South Africa?

25:08.091 --> 25:10.093
Hey, guys, we haven't
had any complaints yet.

25:10.135 --> 25:11.720
That's lekka.

25:11.761 --> 25:13.471
Honestly, I felt like
exterior, you guys

25:13.513 --> 25:14.472
were everything this last trip.

25:14.514 --> 25:16.141
Yeah.

25:16.182 --> 25:18.018
Because I was giving
two percent the entire time.

25:18.059 --> 25:19.269
[laughing]

25:19.310 --> 25:21.271
Dad, are we there yet?

25:22.897 --> 25:25.108
That is absolutely incredible.

25:25.150 --> 25:26.401
-Yeah, I think it's this way.
-Yeah.

25:26.443 --> 25:27.861
Ooh-hoo!

25:27.902 --> 25:29.821
Mm, I love the smell
of the ocean.

25:29.863 --> 25:31.406
-Hi, how are you?
-Hi!

25:31.448 --> 25:33.825
-Oh, my God.
-Oh!

25:33.867 --> 25:35.368
It has, like, the built-in
hot tub looking things.

25:35.410 --> 25:37.162
This is vibey.

25:37.203 --> 25:38.997
Honestly, it's like heaven.

25:39.039 --> 25:41.082
I literally can't wait
to be hungover tomorrow.

25:43.793 --> 25:45.837
This is so ----ing comfy.

25:45.879 --> 25:47.964
Like, everybody's
gonna be drinking,

25:48.006 --> 25:49.215
I'm just gonna be sleeping.

25:49.257 --> 25:50.383
I'm not even joking.

25:50.425 --> 25:52.969
"Sex and the City,"
hot girl summer.

25:53.011 --> 25:54.220
Let's go, let's go.

25:54.262 --> 25:55.221
Where are they going?

25:55.263 --> 25:56.222
They're going swimming.

25:56.264 --> 25:57.390
Oh, nice.

26:01.102 --> 26:03.063
Dave, be careful!

26:03.104 --> 26:06.191
He's gonna be serving dinner
with a broken arm tomorrow.

26:06.232 --> 26:07.776
You must be careful.

26:11.821 --> 26:13.782
Guys, what are you starting
on drinking first?

26:13.823 --> 26:17.077
I was thinking of, like, an
espresso martini to kick me in.

26:17.118 --> 26:18.119
What do you recommend?

26:18.161 --> 26:19.913
I like the sour.

26:19.954 --> 26:22.415
Ooh, yeah, I'll do that,
then, thank you.

26:22.457 --> 26:24.959
What is Dave doing right now?

26:25.001 --> 26:26.127
Oh, my God!

26:26.169 --> 26:28.296
A casual butterfly
in the open sea.

26:28.338 --> 26:31.132
I mean Dave came
to Malta to do the Olympics.

26:32.592 --> 26:34.928
I love it.
I'm, like, I'm moving here.

26:34.969 --> 26:36.304
I might just stay here.

26:36.346 --> 26:37.430
I'm just getting on
with my day, thanks.

26:37.472 --> 26:39.099
Mm.

26:39.140 --> 26:40.600
What Sandy said to me last night
did really upset me.

26:40.642 --> 26:44.896
That really...
that, like, hurt my heart.

26:44.938 --> 26:46.523
Even though we're
given a day off,

26:46.564 --> 26:49.109
I can't get out of thinking
about work.

26:49.150 --> 26:52.904
Between that and my boyfriend's
horrible messages,

26:52.946 --> 26:54.114
I'm just in a bad head space.

26:54.155 --> 26:55.281
It's so unhealthy.

26:55.323 --> 26:56.825
Like, I must be honest...

26:56.866 --> 26:58.201
like, you're handling
it very well.

26:58.243 --> 27:00.870
It's been a bit of
a roller coaster.

27:00.912 --> 27:02.205
Thank you very much.

27:02.247 --> 27:03.957
-You're welcome.
-You all right, J?

27:03.998 --> 27:05.959
-What's that?
-You good?

27:06.001 --> 27:07.544
Are you eating?

27:07.585 --> 27:11.589
Are you eating? Oi!

27:11.631 --> 27:13.299
I was trying to figure out
what you were doing, mate.

27:13.341 --> 27:15.468
-Here.
-There you are.

27:16.886 --> 27:18.430
Hey, where'd you get that from?

27:18.471 --> 27:20.056
-Where'd you get it?
-I ordered it.

27:20.098 --> 27:22.475
The best way to describe
this day off

27:22.517 --> 27:24.185
is to probably break it
down in math terms.

27:24.227 --> 27:25.562
You've got eight yachties,

27:25.603 --> 27:29.274
two of which whose
relationship is toxic.

27:29.315 --> 27:33.028
We have four yachties
who hate my guts.

27:33.069 --> 27:37.282
So, what that equates to is
one day that ----ing sucks.

27:40.326 --> 27:41.327
We're good, buddy.

27:41.369 --> 27:42.537
Sorry?

27:44.039 --> 27:45.999
Coming up...

27:46.041 --> 27:47.292
I didn't ask for anyone to come
to me, I'm separating myself.

27:47.334 --> 27:49.002
You want me to care,

27:49.044 --> 27:50.628
but then you're like if
I come and check in on you,

27:50.670 --> 27:51.921
you're like, "Why are you here,
I don't want sympathy."

27:51.963 --> 27:53.506
-No!
-[bleep]

27:53.548 --> 27:55.300
I just wanna, like, realize
that we need to take it slower.

27:55.342 --> 27:57.135
I don't understand what
I've done to make it fast.

28:12.192 --> 28:13.735
It's the red dragon pipe!

28:16.571 --> 28:18.239
This is not your first rodeo.

28:18.281 --> 28:19.491
Wait, wait, wait...

28:19.532 --> 28:21.159
Babe.

28:25.497 --> 28:27.374
I am, like, freaking out.

28:29.084 --> 28:30.460
Storm.

28:30.502 --> 28:32.170
Like, that's why last night
I was, like,

28:32.212 --> 28:33.463
"Don't give me the gift,
don't give me the gift."

28:33.505 --> 28:35.048
Like, it's too soon,
too quickly.

28:35.090 --> 28:36.299
I was like, "Just don't give
it to me,

28:36.341 --> 28:37.634
because I don't
wanna accept it,"

28:37.676 --> 28:39.302
And then he was like,
"Have it, have it."

28:39.344 --> 28:40.720
So, it's like, give it to me,
and I loved it.

28:40.762 --> 28:42.263
But now, like, even in the car,
like, he's like,

28:42.305 --> 28:44.182
"Oh, just cancel your
plans in Mexico,"

28:44.224 --> 28:45.642
and he goes, "We'll just go to
South Africa for two weeks."

28:45.684 --> 28:47.811
It's just getting
a bit intense too quickly.

28:47.852 --> 28:50.271
He's a very emotional person.

28:50.313 --> 28:52.023
Yeah, and that's
what's freaking me out.

28:52.065 --> 28:53.441
I have my moments
where I'm like,

28:53.483 --> 28:55.151
oh, this could go somewhere,

28:55.193 --> 28:56.695
and then two minutes later
I'm like, how is he

28:56.736 --> 28:58.321
that emotional after only
knowing me for, like, two days.

29:00.782 --> 29:02.325
Is there?

29:02.367 --> 29:04.452
And you nearly slipped
about five times.

29:04.494 --> 29:05.662
It's so slippy!

29:05.704 --> 29:07.330
Oh, my God.

29:07.372 --> 29:08.748
-Do you feel like yours and...
-I have a big one.

29:08.790 --> 29:10.709
Because I feel like mine
and Natalya's dynamic

29:10.750 --> 29:11.710
has changed completely
since yesterday.

29:11.751 --> 29:13.378
Why?

29:13.420 --> 29:15.046
I feel like she feels
guilty for shouting at us.

29:15.088 --> 29:16.756
Well, she feels guilty about
the whole situation,

29:16.798 --> 29:19.426
but you can't just say what
you want without consequences.

29:25.598 --> 29:28.059
-She can clap it, eh?
-Yeah.

29:28.101 --> 29:29.269
She can do it left and right.

29:29.310 --> 29:32.230
I need to put my blanket
over my crotch.

29:32.272 --> 29:33.857
Mzi, drop us a beat.
Mzi, Mzi, drop us a beat.

29:33.898 --> 29:35.734
Mzi's the beatboxer,
I'm the video camera.

29:35.775 --> 29:37.193
[beatboxing]

29:45.660 --> 29:47.203
That's enough.

29:47.245 --> 29:48.747
Nat is a ticking time bomb.

29:48.788 --> 29:51.124
She's always on fuse,
like this,

29:51.166 --> 29:52.667
because she doesn't
face her emotions.

29:52.709 --> 29:54.252
No, no.

29:54.294 --> 29:55.462
Is it still annoying you?

29:55.503 --> 29:58.214
Yeah, I really got upset
by that comment.

29:58.256 --> 30:00.383
You need to let it go, because
it's not true, you know?

30:00.425 --> 30:02.802
No, I just...
I don't know.

30:04.763 --> 30:07.390
No, because I have a lot
of respect for Sandy,

30:07.432 --> 30:09.225
and, like,
I love working for her.

30:09.267 --> 30:10.727
Like, she's such a great person.

30:10.769 --> 30:13.438
And then obviously, I was
upset that I let her down.

30:13.480 --> 30:16.441
I know, well,
we definitely don't agree.

30:16.483 --> 30:18.443
I think you're ----ing
incredible, so...

30:22.864 --> 30:26.326
As much as I didn't
like the person he was

30:26.368 --> 30:29.120
when we were going
through this drama,

30:29.162 --> 30:31.664
he does know how
to make me feel better.

30:31.706 --> 30:33.583
That's very sweet,
and I thank you for that.

30:36.753 --> 30:38.171
What?

30:38.213 --> 30:39.381
That's too much.

30:42.300 --> 30:43.718
You're getting my name
tattooed on you?

30:44.803 --> 30:46.805
No.

30:49.140 --> 30:51.601
I was worried about the watch.
You don't like the watch.

30:51.643 --> 30:52.686
I love the watch.

30:52.727 --> 30:54.479
Sure?

30:54.521 --> 30:56.272
But the meaning behind it
is what I'm scared about.

30:56.314 --> 30:58.608
What's the meaning behind?
It was a gift to you.

30:58.650 --> 31:00.568
There's no meaning,
there's no hidden agenda.

31:00.610 --> 31:02.278
Don't read too much into it.

31:17.794 --> 31:19.838
Let's just see day by day.

31:19.879 --> 31:21.756
Yeah.

31:21.798 --> 31:23.299
Oh, my God!

31:23.341 --> 31:24.801
Oh, God, can I
just go for a piercing

31:24.843 --> 31:26.720
after all of this drama.

31:26.761 --> 31:30.640
Kyle, all I'm saying is that
all I've been doing

31:30.682 --> 31:33.643
is being respectful and
I haven't said anything.

31:33.685 --> 31:35.437
Dude, I would die for a watch.

31:35.478 --> 31:37.522
I would die for a man
like you, you have no idea.

31:37.564 --> 31:39.816
Are you gonna get changed,
are you going for a swim?

31:39.858 --> 31:41.317
Yeah, I've gotta get changed.

31:45.321 --> 31:47.282
I'm sweating balls already.

31:49.367 --> 31:51.745
I think we need to go by,
like, half 6:00.

31:51.786 --> 31:53.288
You getting hungry?

31:53.329 --> 31:54.289
Right now?

31:54.330 --> 31:55.874
Yeah.

31:58.001 --> 31:59.878
I would in a heartbeat.

32:05.842 --> 32:08.386
Why the [bleep] is he crying?
Why the [bleep] is he crying?

32:08.428 --> 32:09.888
It's his dramatic air.

32:09.929 --> 32:12.265
He may as well start singing
to the sky, ah.

32:13.224 --> 32:14.684
Drama, drama, drama.

32:14.726 --> 32:16.561
I'm so hungry.

32:16.603 --> 32:18.480
Excuse me!

32:18.521 --> 32:19.939
Hello.

32:19.981 --> 32:21.775
Hey, what are you gonna do,
jump off the side here?

32:21.816 --> 32:23.526
I'm having just a
bit of a moment.

32:23.568 --> 32:24.778
Yeah, but you're having
a bit of a

32:24.819 --> 32:25.820
too big of a moment, all right?

32:25.862 --> 32:27.364
No, I just went off by myself.

32:27.405 --> 32:28.698
Are we waiting for...

32:28.740 --> 32:31.242
Oh, my God, they make me
sick, [bleep] me.

32:31.284 --> 32:32.911
You've just got to that point?

32:32.952 --> 32:34.412
Am I on a yacht or
am I on "Love Island?"

32:34.454 --> 32:35.705
I didn't ask for anyone
to come to me.

32:35.747 --> 32:36.706
I was doing my own thing.

32:36.748 --> 32:38.333
Yeah, I didn't know,

32:38.375 --> 32:39.417
because I was checking on
you because I care.

32:39.459 --> 32:40.710
Like, obviously I'm gonna be,

32:40.752 --> 32:42.295
like, "I'm gonna
go check on him."

32:42.337 --> 32:43.797
I'm not gonna be like,
"Oh, yeah, sure."

32:43.838 --> 32:44.798
Would you prefer that,
that no one checks in on you

32:44.839 --> 32:45.965
and that you left?

32:46.007 --> 32:48.885
I... no, because that's what...

32:48.927 --> 32:50.512
I'm separating myself.

32:50.553 --> 32:51.930
But you want me to care,
but then you're like

32:51.971 --> 32:53.515
if I come and check in on you,
you're like,

32:53.556 --> 32:54.557
"Why are you here,
I don't want sympathy."

32:54.599 --> 32:55.975
No!

32:56.017 --> 32:57.894
Obviously, I'm gonna
check in on how you are.

33:02.482 --> 33:03.900
Well, right now,
there's everyone...

33:03.942 --> 33:05.360
this is a drama, because
right now the crew's

33:05.402 --> 33:06.986
supposed to be going
out for dinner.

33:07.028 --> 33:17.080
Do you know what?

33:23.211 --> 33:25.046
Do you know what?

33:26.256 --> 33:26.589
Deal with your own temper
tantrum, then...

33:27.465 --> 33:29.426
temper tantrum, I can't speak.

33:29.467 --> 33:30.844
Honestly, what do
you want from this?

33:30.885 --> 33:32.721
I'm saying you're
doing a great job,

33:32.762 --> 33:33.847
then you're saying I don't
need you to tell me that.

33:33.888 --> 33:35.390
I don't need you
to feel like

33:35.432 --> 33:37.017
you have to come to me
and to be, like...

33:37.058 --> 33:38.810
But then you want me to care
for you and make plans, when...

33:38.852 --> 33:40.186
I'm don't... I'm not asking you
to do anything

33:40.228 --> 33:41.604
that you don't wanna do.

33:41.646 --> 33:43.023
You can do whatever
you wanna do.

33:43.064 --> 33:44.607
Oh, my God,
you're literally that confusing.

33:44.649 --> 33:45.775
I thought we were leaving,
like, an hour ago.

33:45.817 --> 33:47.527
Down there, they're still...

33:47.569 --> 33:49.154
I'm not saying I don't
want this at all.

33:49.195 --> 33:51.197
I want this, I'm trying,
I'm doing this day by day.

33:51.239 --> 33:52.782
I just wanna, like,
realize that we need

33:52.824 --> 33:54.534
to take it slower a little bit.

33:54.576 --> 33:56.536
I don't understand what
I've done to make it fast.

33:56.578 --> 33:59.164
I'm just saying I want
you to realize that,

33:59.205 --> 34:01.082
like, I'm very slow.

34:01.124 --> 34:02.709
I've never had
a relationship, so...

34:02.751 --> 34:04.544
It's not a relationship.

34:04.586 --> 34:06.671
Okay, cool, then you said it...
it's not a relationship.

34:06.713 --> 34:09.507
That's chill, then,
as long as you said it.

34:09.549 --> 34:11.718
If she thinks that we're moving
too fast, then all right.

34:11.760 --> 34:13.553
I have a different mindset,

34:13.595 --> 34:15.096
but for me right now
what I wanna do is

34:15.138 --> 34:16.723
I don't wanna ruin
whatever we have.

34:16.765 --> 34:19.059
I think I'm just gonna
slow it down a bit,

34:19.100 --> 34:20.727
because I don't wanna get hurt

34:20.769 --> 34:22.437
as much as she
doesn't wanna get hurt.

34:22.479 --> 34:26.066
Let's have a glass of water
and eat some salad.

34:26.107 --> 34:27.192
-Sure.
-Okay?

34:27.233 --> 34:28.902
Should we...

34:28.943 --> 34:30.737
should we rip the Band-Aid off,
new fresh start again?

34:30.779 --> 34:32.489
Yeah.

34:32.530 --> 34:34.783
Oh, here they are...
guys, ready.

34:34.824 --> 34:37.243
Ugh!

34:37.285 --> 34:38.787
We're off.

34:38.828 --> 34:39.913
Are you hos ready to go
and have some dinner?

34:39.954 --> 34:41.039
-Yes!
-Let's go.

34:43.958 --> 34:45.919
-I'll go this one.
-Oh, God.

34:45.960 --> 34:47.921
Oh, my God,
the beach stuff was so fun.

34:47.962 --> 34:49.464
It was so good!

34:49.506 --> 34:51.216
Yeah, that was actually
really fun, good day.

34:51.257 --> 34:52.842
It was one time when
I just wanted to chill.

34:52.884 --> 34:53.843
Like, I mean, Jason
is really keeping himself

34:53.885 --> 34:55.095
away from the group.

34:55.136 --> 34:56.763
I'm just gonna put
that out there.

34:56.805 --> 34:58.014
If you're part of a
social group, then sorry,

34:58.056 --> 34:59.683
can you put in a
little bit of effort?

34:59.724 --> 35:01.017
I'm having a conversation
with him tomorrow.

35:01.059 --> 35:02.560
That's, like,
a wild card, you know?

35:02.602 --> 35:04.646
It could get, like,
Jason times 10.

35:06.147 --> 35:08.233
No, he speaks quite a bit
when he's on deck.

35:10.068 --> 35:12.696
Oh, my gosh, look at this!

35:12.737 --> 35:14.906
This is so cute.

35:14.948 --> 35:16.533
Wowsa.

35:16.574 --> 35:17.742
You brought your whole bag with?

35:17.784 --> 35:19.494
-Uh-huh.
-Can I have some shots, no?

35:19.536 --> 35:20.745
No shots.

35:20.787 --> 35:22.122
Wow, this is beautiful.

35:22.163 --> 35:23.581
What a pretty city.

35:23.623 --> 35:26.501
What's everyone thinking?

35:26.543 --> 35:28.128
Anal.

35:32.257 --> 35:34.968
It's so quiet, you
guys get so serious.

35:35.010 --> 35:37.137
You know what,
besides all the drama,

35:37.178 --> 35:39.055
all the hate,
all the exclusions,

35:39.097 --> 35:41.558
all the inclusions,
I absolutely am

35:41.599 --> 35:43.935
having the world's
most fantastic time

35:43.977 --> 35:45.979
with each and every
single one of you.

35:46.021 --> 35:47.689
I just wanna say something.

35:47.731 --> 35:49.274
Always wanna top it, always.

35:49.315 --> 35:51.526
Everyone's been really great,
besides Kyle, obviously,

35:51.568 --> 35:54.112
and I'm really glad
that you're here for it.

35:57.198 --> 35:58.700
I'm gonna get you a little
badge made up and everything,

35:58.742 --> 35:59.993
a little medal.

36:00.035 --> 36:01.745
I just want to be the only one

36:01.786 --> 36:03.788
that hasn't kicked off
with one crewmember.

36:03.830 --> 36:05.165
You get kicked off
with everybody.

36:05.206 --> 36:07.208
-Not... name one.
-Behind their backs.

36:07.250 --> 36:08.752
Name one.

36:08.793 --> 36:10.670
Natalya is a Tasmanian Devil...

36:10.712 --> 36:15.175
very cute to look at,
but hella annoying.

36:15.216 --> 36:16.760
The drinks are ready.

36:16.801 --> 36:17.969
Thank you, man.

36:18.011 --> 36:19.054
...for you.

36:19.095 --> 36:20.347
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

36:20.388 --> 36:21.681
To a great day off.

36:21.723 --> 36:23.058
Cheers to a great day off.

36:23.099 --> 36:24.142
Cheers, cheers.

36:24.184 --> 36:25.602
Who do you think's the fittest?

36:25.643 --> 36:27.312
Okay, we obviously
know it's you.

36:27.354 --> 36:30.565
But other than Dave, who's
the next fittest in the crew?

36:30.607 --> 36:32.067
-Probably J, maybe.
-Yeah.

36:32.108 --> 36:33.568
Are you, like, exercise guy?

36:34.652 --> 36:35.862
Yeah, do you wanna go?

36:35.904 --> 36:37.030
-Yeah, I'll go with you.
-Yeah.

36:37.072 --> 36:38.656
-You gonna have a ciggie?
-Yeah.

36:38.698 --> 36:39.824
All right, so club after this?

36:39.866 --> 36:41.618
You love the club life.

36:41.659 --> 36:43.328
What, so you can leave us
for your married woman again?

36:43.370 --> 36:45.288
-No.
-She was actually stunning.

36:45.330 --> 36:48.083
Probably why her husband
married her.

36:48.124 --> 36:49.125
Are you the pizza?

36:49.167 --> 36:50.293
Ooh!

36:50.335 --> 36:52.170
Rib-eye steak, medium.

36:52.212 --> 36:55.131
Thank you.

36:55.173 --> 36:57.884
Ah.

36:57.926 --> 36:58.885
It's so nice here.

36:58.927 --> 37:00.679
It is honestly lovely.

37:01.680 --> 37:02.889
I'm sorry, babes.

37:02.931 --> 37:04.641
It's fine.

37:06.351 --> 37:08.603
Oh sh-- like,
is it something that's...

37:09.979 --> 37:11.731
[bleep]

37:11.773 --> 37:13.108
So, like, he'd gone
in the home and, like

37:13.149 --> 37:14.734
[bleep] I've been so busy
until now

37:14.776 --> 37:15.819
that I haven't really
thought about it.

37:15.860 --> 37:17.737
It was so hard when I left,

37:17.779 --> 37:18.738
because I'd only seen him once
since he's gone in there,

37:18.780 --> 37:21.366
and, like...

37:21.408 --> 37:23.618
anyway, I'm fine, obviously.

37:25.995 --> 37:28.832
Last season, my dad,
he was always there for me

37:28.873 --> 37:30.750
-and things when I needed him.
-Hi, Dad, you okay?

37:30.792 --> 37:31.751
I'm all right, how are you?

37:31.793 --> 37:33.378
Yeah, I'm just working.

37:33.420 --> 37:35.797
Sixteen and a half hour day,
like, every day on charter.

37:35.839 --> 37:38.925
Last year, like, it was just a
really bad year for me, I feel.

37:38.967 --> 37:41.219
Whew, okay.

37:41.261 --> 37:43.680
My dad went into
home and stuff...

37:44.723 --> 37:45.890
oh, sorry.

37:48.727 --> 37:50.979
So, now he's just, like,

37:51.021 --> 37:53.440
can't talk, can't walk,
can't do anything.

37:53.481 --> 37:54.649
He's just lying in a bed.

37:54.691 --> 37:56.109
When I was scrubbing toilets,

37:56.151 --> 37:58.069
I was like, what the [bleep]
am I doing with my life?

37:58.111 --> 38:00.989
That was kind of the start of,
like, my deck crew journey.

38:01.031 --> 38:02.824
Even though it's so hard
to be away from home,

38:02.866 --> 38:05.118
I love working on deck,
I love being active.

38:05.160 --> 38:07.245
So, to know that I'm kind of
going in the right direction,

38:07.287 --> 38:10.665
it just makes it a lot
easier to be here.

38:15.003 --> 38:16.463
Yeah, wild.

38:16.504 --> 38:19.049
So, you've just gotta
live life, you know?

38:19.090 --> 38:21.134
-YOLO.
-Thank you.

38:21.176 --> 38:22.385
Thank you so much, guys.

38:22.427 --> 38:23.470
Let's all go.

38:23.511 --> 38:26.973
-Home, home.
-Yeah.

38:27.015 --> 38:28.016
Hop on in.

38:31.686 --> 38:37.067
I can't wait to just lay down.

38:37.108 --> 38:38.234
Oh, my God.

38:40.862 --> 38:42.030
[glass clinks]

38:43.865 --> 38:45.075
Me, too.

38:45.116 --> 38:46.701
Is your seatbelt on?

38:46.743 --> 38:48.078
I'm going to bed.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.419
"What time are
we starting tomorrow?"

38:56.461 --> 38:58.129
Whenever you ----ing
want, Jason.

38:58.171 --> 38:59.214
He can message.

38:59.255 --> 39:02.300
Say 8:30 on deck.

39:06.429 --> 39:07.889
And I said "please."

39:07.931 --> 39:10.725
Oh, you even made it "pls."

39:10.767 --> 39:12.977
I hate a "pls," brü.

39:14.104 --> 39:15.355
Why?

39:19.484 --> 39:22.946
The last couple charters,
Jason has been insubordinate.

39:22.987 --> 39:24.030
He's told me to [bleep] off.

39:24.072 --> 39:25.448
That's not a bowline, dude.

39:25.490 --> 39:27.033
I did a ----ing bowline,
learn your knots.

39:27.075 --> 39:29.369
Then you must do
a proper bowline.

39:29.411 --> 39:30.829
Now he's doing the
same to Courtney.

39:30.870 --> 39:32.038
You guys have been ----ing

39:32.080 --> 39:33.289
messing up the bimini
for a while.

39:33.331 --> 39:35.041
What are you mumbling?

39:35.083 --> 39:36.459
It's already been on the wrong
side of the bimini

39:36.501 --> 39:38.878
since you guys brought it
in the first time.

39:38.920 --> 39:39.963
This is the first time
I've ever had to do something

39:40.005 --> 39:41.756
like this in my life...

39:41.798 --> 39:44.050
you know, have a conversation
with someone about the way

39:44.092 --> 39:46.803
that they are, their work ethic,
their personality.

39:46.845 --> 39:48.054
I'm nervous, I don't really
know what to expect,

39:48.096 --> 39:49.764
but I just have to fix this.

39:49.806 --> 39:51.016
This is an issue.

39:54.060 --> 39:56.354
Jason's attitude,
that stops tomorrow.

40:14.497 --> 40:15.540
Hi!

40:24.924 --> 40:26.551
Oh [bleep].

40:35.352 --> 40:36.895
What's up, dawgs?

40:42.108 --> 40:44.027
Listen, if that's how you
wanna start today,

40:44.069 --> 40:45.695
then start today like that,

40:45.737 --> 40:48.281
because I'll give it
right back to you, sis.

40:48.323 --> 40:50.325
Did you wake up on
the wrong side of the bed?

40:50.367 --> 40:52.243
I did, I woke up
to your stinky laundry.

40:54.954 --> 40:56.915
I feel like I'm putting my job,

40:56.956 --> 40:58.291
the job that
I've taken responsibility

40:58.333 --> 41:00.001
-for the two of us.
-Yeah.

41:00.043 --> 41:01.711
I guess just start
top to bottom, yeah?

41:01.753 --> 41:03.463
-Yep.
-Thanks, guys.

41:08.093 --> 41:09.344
I'm gonna do the twin now.

41:09.386 --> 41:11.304
Nice work on the pantry.

41:11.346 --> 41:13.098
Oh, did you see the cupboards?

41:13.139 --> 41:15.225
Yeah, they look good,
so let's keep them that way.

41:15.266 --> 41:16.309
Mm-hmm.

41:22.732 --> 41:23.983
J...

41:26.319 --> 41:28.029
-Yeah.

41:29.447 --> 41:30.990
All right.

41:31.032 --> 41:32.409
All crew, all crew,
provisions have arrived.

41:32.450 --> 41:34.119
Copy, coming.

41:35.453 --> 41:37.247
-Eggs.
-Yeah, eggies are good.

41:37.288 --> 41:39.332
Yeah, mate.

41:39.374 --> 41:42.085
* I'm there in the galley and
I'm chillin' with daddy *

41:42.127 --> 41:43.253
Is that it?

41:51.219 --> 41:54.264
You know my helping you and
sh--,

41:54.305 --> 41:55.598
I just wanna make sure
that I'm not

41:55.640 --> 41:58.518
overstepping my boundaries,
you know?

41:58.560 --> 41:59.644
-No, I appreciate...
-Because obviously...

41:59.686 --> 42:01.396
I appreciate that you care.

42:01.438 --> 42:03.398
All right, sweet,
I'm glad that's over with.

42:08.486 --> 42:12.115
I'm gonna have my conversation
with Jason now.

42:12.157 --> 42:13.616
It's gonna be fun.

42:13.658 --> 42:15.243
Good luck.

42:15.285 --> 42:17.620
Ugh, I hate this sh--.

42:17.662 --> 42:19.205
Managing people
and understanding people

42:19.247 --> 42:20.999
is all new to me.

42:21.041 --> 42:24.169
I'm just trying to, like,
learn in my new position,

42:24.210 --> 42:26.671
and understand that this is
the responsibility as you do,

42:26.713 --> 42:28.423
and try and make him feel
a part of the team.

42:30.091 --> 42:32.302
Jason, can I have a quick chat?

42:32.344 --> 42:33.553
Yep.

42:33.595 --> 42:35.764
And hopefully,
he just takes it well

42:35.805 --> 42:37.599
and doesn't be Jason, I guess.

42:37.640 --> 42:40.018
How's the washdown going?

42:40.060 --> 42:41.269
Good.

42:45.357 --> 42:47.567
I just wanted to
have a quick chat

42:47.609 --> 42:48.610
so we could be on
the same page, dude.

42:48.651 --> 42:50.445
Cool.

42:50.487 --> 42:54.115
I feel like there's a lot
of tension between you and I

42:54.157 --> 42:55.658
and between you and the crew,

42:55.700 --> 42:57.744
and I wanna know, like,
where your head's at.

42:57.786 --> 43:00.163
Because I've got some things
that I would like to say

43:00.205 --> 43:02.499
but I wanna hear
from your side first.

43:02.540 --> 43:07.170
Just trying not to stepping on
toes, and just grinding it out.

43:07.212 --> 43:10.423
Yeah, man, I feel like,
I don't know, dude,

43:10.465 --> 43:14.469
you get into, like, this mood,
and we can all feel it.

43:14.511 --> 43:20.225
Then you become, like, snappy,
or how do I say this...

43:20.266 --> 43:22.519
like, it becomes
very difficult

43:22.560 --> 43:24.104
to work in an environment
when we...

43:24.145 --> 43:25.647
when you're like that.

43:25.689 --> 43:27.816
So, what I wanna challenge
you for this next charter

43:27.857 --> 43:29.359
is to be proactive.

43:29.401 --> 43:32.070
Like, I need you to show me,
to show Sandy,

43:32.112 --> 43:34.322
and to show our team
that you wanna be here.

43:34.364 --> 43:36.366
So, what's baffling to me
is, like,

43:36.408 --> 43:38.410
when you say
"be more proactive,"

43:38.451 --> 43:40.662
I'm like, dude, I'm...

43:40.704 --> 43:44.124
I feel like I'm carrying more
than my load, to be very fair.

43:44.165 --> 43:46.459
-That's how you honestly feel?
-Yes.

43:46.501 --> 43:48.294
I feel that it's the
other way around

43:48.336 --> 43:50.130
I couldn't feel more different,
and that's the issue.

43:50.171 --> 43:52.215
That's what I'm saying...

43:52.257 --> 43:53.800
I don't wanna leave anyone
high and dry, but replace me.

43:53.842 --> 43:55.552
No, that's...

43:55.593 --> 43:56.594
I'm telling you right now,
bring someone else in.

43:56.636 --> 43:58.304
If that's what it is, because...

43:58.346 --> 43:59.556
That's not... well, you
don't want to be here

43:59.597 --> 44:00.807
if you're saying things
like that.

44:00.849 --> 44:02.392
That's literally
what I'm saying.

44:02.434 --> 44:03.685
I'm trying to change
my personality...

44:03.727 --> 44:05.103
No, don't change your
personality.

44:05.145 --> 44:06.855
I'm not here to
make you a victim.

44:06.896 --> 44:07.856
Well, that's the problem,
it's already been brought up.

44:07.897 --> 44:09.274
I want you to stay, mate.
