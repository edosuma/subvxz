00:01.367 --> 00:03.567
Kal Penn:
 Ladies and gentlemen,

00:03.567 --> 00:06.000
you will witness
outrageously tough challenges.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.567
There are 20 pairs
of doctors and nurses.

00:08.567 --> 00:10.133
Your job is to put

00:10.133 --> 00:11.667
the original couples
back together correct.

00:11.667 --> 00:13.000
- You. You. You.
- Penn: Correct.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.100
- Amazing. 
- Wow!

00:16.100 --> 00:18.300
Study the maze and figure out
the correct route...

00:18.300 --> 00:20.266
Turn left
and take two steps,

00:20.266 --> 00:22.667
turn right
and take one step
and a left.

00:22.667 --> 00:25.834
They didn't make it
easy for him.

00:25.834 --> 00:27.400
52 cards to memorize,

00:27.400 --> 00:29.500
recall the exact order...

00:29.500 --> 00:31.433
Queen of clubs,
ace of hearts,

00:31.433 --> 00:34.834
ace of spades--
uh, no.

00:34.834 --> 00:36.900
- Which country? 
- Djibouti.

00:36.900 --> 00:39.000
Djibouti.
I've been to Djibouti,

00:39.000 --> 00:40.800
and I bought a T-shirt
that said I was

00:40.800 --> 00:43.767
"all up in Djibouti."

00:43.767 --> 00:47.200
The winner
of the $50,000

00:47.200 --> 00:48.767
and the title
of SuperHuman

00:48.767 --> 00:50.166
is...

00:50.166 --> 00:51.300
That was amazing!

00:51.300 --> 00:53.533
- You are such a rock star.
- You got it!

00:53.533 --> 00:55.967
Wow! Good job.

01:01.834 --> 01:05.233
â™ª

01:05.233 --> 01:06.934
All right!

01:06.934 --> 01:11.800
( cheers, whistles )

01:11.800 --> 01:14.834
( whistles, applause )

01:14.834 --> 01:18.433
Welcome to "SuperHuman"!

01:18.433 --> 01:19.433
I'm Kal Penn.

01:19.433 --> 01:20.900
And over the next
60 minutes,

01:20.900 --> 01:23.633
our contestants
are going to compete

01:23.633 --> 01:25.200
in outrageously
tough challenges,

01:25.200 --> 01:29.934
and one of them
will walk away with $50,000,

01:29.934 --> 01:33.300
and the title
of SuperHuman!

01:33.300 --> 01:36.300
But first, they have
to make it into the top three

01:36.300 --> 01:39.100
and that will be chosen
by our panel.

01:39.100 --> 01:41.100
He was the first boxer
in history

01:41.100 --> 01:43.667
to hold all three
heavy weight titles

01:43.667 --> 01:45.734
simultaneously.

01:45.734 --> 01:46.834
It's Mike Tyson.

01:46.834 --> 01:49.033
( cheering )

01:52.133 --> 01:55.266
Next, someone who
has to juggle her life

01:55.266 --> 01:57.367
between being
a sensational singer

01:57.367 --> 01:59.667
an amazing actress,
and a mom.

01:59.667 --> 02:01.233
It's Christina Milian.

02:05.400 --> 02:08.567
And bringing some
true brain power
to the panel--

02:08.567 --> 02:10.066
no offense
to the rest of us--

02:10.066 --> 02:12.734
it's top neuroscientist
and brain surgeon,

02:12.734 --> 02:13.800
Dr. Rahul Jandial.

02:19.934 --> 02:22.266
Okay, lock the door,
grab a seat,

02:22.266 --> 02:23.767
and pay very close
attention

02:23.767 --> 02:26.266
because it's time to witness
some amazing things.

02:26.266 --> 02:27.467
Let's get to it.

02:27.467 --> 02:30.133
This superhuman
has a built-in GPS system

02:30.133 --> 02:31.433
the always steers him
in the right direction.

02:31.433 --> 02:33.333
It's amazing David Millar.

02:36.767 --> 02:38.600
My name is David Millar,

02:38.600 --> 02:40.900
and my superhuman ability
is mazes.

02:40.900 --> 02:43.266
Mazes always gave me
an opportunity

02:43.266 --> 02:44.300
to be sort of like

02:44.300 --> 02:46.066
an adventurer
or an explorer.

02:46.066 --> 02:48.000
You can drop me
in the middle of any city

02:48.000 --> 02:49.467
as long as
I've seen a map

02:49.467 --> 02:51.533
I can find
any destination
you give me.

02:51.533 --> 02:53.700
I'm literally
the perfect co-pilot.

02:53.700 --> 02:55.166
I can always determine

02:55.166 --> 02:57.000
what's going to be
the best route.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.900
Being able to do this
is something

02:58.900 --> 03:02.300
that I want to show off
to everyone.

03:02.300 --> 03:05.033
From Fort Worth, Texas,
here's David Millar.

03:09.300 --> 03:11.734
Hey, man,
how are you?

03:11.734 --> 03:13.266
I'm good.
How are you?

03:13.266 --> 03:15.300
- Welcome to "SuperHuman."
- Thank you for having me.

03:15.300 --> 03:17.967
I love
the bandana/shirt
matching combo.

03:17.967 --> 03:19.467
- Awesome.
- Thank you.

03:19.467 --> 03:21.300
Your challenge,
David,

03:21.300 --> 03:24.300
is called
Follow My Steps.

03:24.300 --> 03:27.333
On the stage behind us
we've got a giant maze.

03:27.333 --> 03:29.500
Your challenge
will be to study the maze

03:29.500 --> 03:31.667
and figure out
the correct route
from start to finish,

03:31.667 --> 03:33.166
- and there's only one way.
- All right.

03:33.166 --> 03:35.333
Then with your back
to the maze,

03:35.333 --> 03:37.900
you'll have to direct me
through it

03:37.900 --> 03:40.233
from memory alone,
is that clear?

03:40.233 --> 03:42.867
- That's 100% clear.
- All right,

03:42.867 --> 03:44.800
please take your position
in the SuperHuman chair.

03:44.800 --> 03:46.000
All right.

03:49.066 --> 03:51.400
Woo!

03:51.400 --> 03:52.800
Penn: Okay, David,
whenever you're ready

03:52.800 --> 03:55.266
we'll turn
the chair around

03:55.266 --> 03:56.500
so you can
study the maze

03:56.500 --> 03:58.800
and memorize
every step and turn.

03:58.800 --> 04:01.133
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready.

04:01.133 --> 04:03.033
- Let's do this.
- Please turn
the chair around.

04:12.133 --> 04:16.800
David, each box on the maze
will represent one step.

04:16.800 --> 04:18.166
Please study it
carefully.

04:18.166 --> 04:20.800
Every step
will be critical.

04:41.467 --> 04:42.700
All right,
I think I'm ready.

04:42.700 --> 04:44.400
All right, Dave,
let's do this.

04:46.133 --> 04:48.200
All right,
David!

04:51.433 --> 04:53.467
Dave, I'm at
the start position,

04:53.467 --> 04:55.967
but I'm counting on you
to get me to the end.

04:55.967 --> 04:57.166
If this goes wrong,

04:57.166 --> 04:59.266
people may never
see me again.

05:00.767 --> 05:03.667
Okay,
your challenge
starts now.

05:06.800 --> 05:08.133
All right, Kal,

05:08.133 --> 05:10.400
go ahead
and take your first step
into the maze,

05:10.400 --> 05:13.233
and we're gonna start
by going forward three steps.

05:14.967 --> 05:17.333
Go ahead and turn left
and take two steps.

05:19.066 --> 05:20.967
Okay,
I've done that.

05:20.967 --> 05:23.567
Go ahead and turn right
and take one step

05:23.567 --> 05:26.900
and a left and two steps,

05:26.900 --> 05:28.800
then take a right
and take one step.

05:28.800 --> 05:32.500
Take a right here
and take one more step.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.066
Okay.

05:39.467 --> 05:42.166
Now take a left
and go five steps forward.

05:46.367 --> 05:48.633
- Okay.
- All right,
now take a right

05:48.633 --> 05:50.867
and take
five more steps
forward.

05:53.967 --> 05:55.233
And take
another right

05:55.233 --> 05:57.800
and take
one step forward.

06:03.967 --> 06:08.100
Now turn left
and take two steps forward,

06:08.100 --> 06:12.266
followed by a right
and one step forward,

06:12.266 --> 06:15.667
a left
one step forward

06:15.667 --> 06:18.166
and then another left
and two steps forward.

06:18.166 --> 06:19.600
Okay.

06:29.300 --> 06:30.767
And now another left

06:30.767 --> 06:33.834
and two more steps forward.

06:33.834 --> 06:37.133
- They didn't make it
easy for him.
- No.

06:37.133 --> 06:39.133
Now we're gonna take
a few quick small steps,

06:39.133 --> 06:42.133
take a right
and take one step,

06:42.133 --> 06:45.133
a left one step

06:45.133 --> 06:47.133
and a right
one more step.

06:47.133 --> 06:50.033
Now take a right
and take two steps forward,

06:50.033 --> 06:52.533
another right

06:52.533 --> 06:54.600
and one step forward,

06:54.600 --> 06:57.600
and then a left
and one step forward.

06:57.600 --> 07:01.500
Turn left again,
take three steps forward,

07:01.500 --> 07:04.333
followed by another left

07:04.333 --> 07:06.266
and one step forward.

07:06.266 --> 07:08.767
One more left
and one more step forward.

07:08.767 --> 07:11.300
Now take a right--

07:11.300 --> 07:12.367
just take one step forward...

07:18.633 --> 07:21.467
and then take a right.

07:21.467 --> 07:25.266
Take one more step forward
and then a left.

07:25.266 --> 07:29.200
Take two more steps forward
and then take a right.

07:32.300 --> 07:34.934
And now
lift your hands up
and yell, "Wee!"

07:34.934 --> 07:36.600
when you jump out
of the maze.

07:36.600 --> 07:39.266
Wee!
Nice job, man!

07:39.266 --> 07:40.500
Wow!

07:43.200 --> 07:45.500
I need a hug.

07:51.767 --> 07:56.000
- That's crazy.
- Woo!

07:56.000 --> 07:58.400
The most
obviously question
I can ask you

07:58.400 --> 08:02.266
is what technique
do you use to recall
that route?

08:02.266 --> 08:05.100
Um, when I picture
the route in my head,

08:05.100 --> 08:08.266
I sort of see
this almost cursive
handwriting.

08:08.266 --> 08:09.934
Like I'm taking
a big red marker

08:09.934 --> 08:13.533
and writing the solution
and it flows through my head

08:13.533 --> 08:15.433
as I'm going through the maze
and walking through it.

08:15.433 --> 08:16.734
Whoa.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.700
So, Dr. Jandial,
is David's ability

08:21.700 --> 08:22.700
something that
we could all develop--

08:22.700 --> 08:24.367
kind of an internal GPS?

08:24.367 --> 08:26.700
Or is there
something unique
that he's just got?

08:26.700 --> 08:29.033
We absolutely
do have an internal GPS,

08:29.033 --> 08:30.533
and it's got a cool name.

08:30.533 --> 08:32.200
It's called
entorhinal cortex.

08:32.200 --> 08:34.567
And what happens, just like
a construction worker

08:34.567 --> 08:36.734
lays down cement,
if you practice,

08:36.734 --> 08:37.900
your brain will
lay down tissue

08:37.900 --> 08:39.232
to cement your memory.

08:39.232 --> 08:42.033
So you can
bulk up your memory zone
if you practice.

08:42.033 --> 08:43.633
But what
you showed us today,

08:43.633 --> 08:45.300
- I think is superhuman.
- Thank you.

08:45.300 --> 08:47.633
You are like such a rock star.
You're a rock star.

08:47.633 --> 08:50.867
You came out here
with all the beautiful energy

08:50.867 --> 08:52.467
and then
you memorized that.

08:52.467 --> 08:54.533
- Amazing.
- Mike: It's too amazing.

08:54.533 --> 08:56.700
I mean, you're very--
you're a blessed individual.

08:56.700 --> 08:59.100
- You really are awesome.
- Thank you.

08:59.100 --> 09:01.467
So will his
incredible recall

09:01.467 --> 09:04.367
win David $50,000?

09:04.367 --> 09:05.700
It's all up to the panelists
and the audience.

09:05.700 --> 09:08.200
Right now, one more time
for David Millar.

09:08.200 --> 09:09.867
Thanks, man.
Really nicely done.

09:09.867 --> 09:11.000
We'll see you
at the end of the show.

09:12.166 --> 09:15.967
Awesome.

09:15.967 --> 09:18.100
We're gonna give you
complex equations.

09:18.100 --> 09:19.500
You're going
head-to-head

09:19.500 --> 09:21.934
with a calculator.

09:21.934 --> 09:24.133
And that calculator
will be operated by

09:24.133 --> 09:27.533
Internationally
renowned neuroscientist
Dr. Rahul Jandial.

09:29.367 --> 09:30.667
Don't let him win, doc.

09:30.667 --> 09:32.066
( bell dinging )

09:39.200 --> 09:41.266
Penn:
Hey, welcome back
to "SuperHuman"!

09:41.266 --> 09:44.166
This superhuman
contestant

09:44.166 --> 09:47.533
is a superfast
mental math master.

09:47.533 --> 09:48.667
He's Andrew Body.

09:52.300 --> 09:55.367
My name is Andrew Body,
and my superhuman ability
is mental math.

09:55.367 --> 09:57.033
Effectively, doing math

09:57.033 --> 09:59.100
with the way
people would do math
with pen and paper,

09:59.100 --> 10:00.266
except I can do it
all in my head,

10:00.266 --> 10:01.633
and I can do it
generally much quicker.

10:01.633 --> 10:03.734
My childhood was perfect.
The all-American lifestyle.

10:03.734 --> 10:06.567
Baseball over the summers,
basketball in the winters.

10:06.567 --> 10:08.333
Playing baseball
my coach would ask me

10:08.333 --> 10:09.867
to tabulate
the batting averages.

10:09.867 --> 10:12.467
And he'd say,
"Body, so-and-so's
five for 14."

10:12.467 --> 10:14.033
And I'd say,
"He's hitting 357, coach.

10:14.033 --> 10:16.033
He's doing well.
Keep him in the lineup."

10:16.033 --> 10:18.333
There are always these numbers
running through my head.

10:18.333 --> 10:19.867
As a kid I fought it,

10:19.867 --> 10:21.300
then eventually
I just embraced it.

10:21.300 --> 10:23.533
It's a part of who I am,
and it's not going to change.

10:27.200 --> 10:29.033
From Zanesville, Ohio,

10:29.033 --> 10:30.734
please welcome
Andrew Body!

10:33.533 --> 10:35.166
- Hey, buddy.
- Andrew: Hey, Kal,
how are you?

10:35.166 --> 10:36.333
- Welcome to the show.
- Thank you.

10:36.333 --> 10:37.600
- How are you, Andrew?
- It's good to be here.

10:37.600 --> 10:40.166
Your challenge, Andrew,

10:40.166 --> 10:43.166
is called
Number Cruncher.

10:43.166 --> 10:45.467
We're gonna give you
some complex equations

10:45.467 --> 10:47.166
which you'll
have to answer
as fast as you can,

10:47.166 --> 10:48.834
and you have
to answer fast

10:48.834 --> 10:53.100
because you're
going head-to-head
with a calculator.

10:53.100 --> 10:55.166
- Oh, wow.
- And that calculator

10:55.166 --> 10:58.266
will be operated
by internationally
renowned neuroscientist

10:58.266 --> 10:59.934
and professor
of brain surgery

10:59.934 --> 11:01.367
with the fastest hands
of the operating room

11:01.367 --> 11:02.800
Dr. Rahul Jandial.

11:05.133 --> 11:08.467
Gentlemen, please both take
your positions back-to-back.

11:08.467 --> 11:10.333
Come on, doc.

11:10.333 --> 11:12.900
Good luck to you.

11:15.400 --> 11:17.600
Andrew,
you'll see the equation
in front of you.

11:17.600 --> 11:20.800
As soon as
you figure out the answer
shout it out.

11:20.800 --> 11:23.166
Dr. Jandial,
we'll see the equation

11:23.166 --> 11:25.233
come up
on the screen
above...

11:25.233 --> 11:26.900
three equations
and the ultimate test

11:26.900 --> 11:28.567
between man
versus machine.

11:28.567 --> 11:30.266
- ( chuckles )
- Are you both ready?

11:30.266 --> 11:31.667
- Yes, sir.
- Let's do it.

11:31.667 --> 11:34.667
Andrew,
your challenge starts...

11:34.667 --> 11:36.567
- now.
- ( bell dings )

11:37.867 --> 11:39.433
Here comes
the first equation.

11:44.500 --> 11:46.166
104.

11:46.166 --> 11:48.066
And stop,
Dr. Jandial,

11:48.066 --> 11:52.567
because you were still typing
when Andrew gave his answer.

11:52.567 --> 11:54.667
Andrew said 104.
Let's see if he's right.

11:57.233 --> 11:58.133
104.

12:00.900 --> 12:02.367
Wanna move to Vegas?

12:04.400 --> 12:05.834
You're getting
job offers

12:05.834 --> 12:08.066
and you're
not even done with
the challenge yet.

12:08.066 --> 12:09.934
Okay.

12:09.934 --> 12:11.433
Here comes
the next equation.

12:23.700 --> 12:24.700
Four.

12:24.700 --> 12:26.100
- Stop, Dr. Jandial.
- Woo.

12:27.633 --> 12:30.100
Andrew, you think
the answer is four.

12:31.633 --> 12:32.800
First-- ah hah.
I didn't--

12:32.800 --> 12:35.133
I thought it was
a division sign there.

12:35.133 --> 12:37.867
Instead of
the addition sign,

12:37.867 --> 12:39.200
I read that as
a division sign.

12:39.200 --> 12:40.900
I got ahead
of myself.

12:42.367 --> 12:44.467
Okay.
What would
it be then?

12:44.467 --> 12:47.400
So I'd be seven, six, plus 19.
It should've been 95.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.333
Penn: Unfortunately,

12:49.333 --> 12:52.834
we can only accept
your first answer of four,
which is incorrect.

12:52.834 --> 12:55.834
Let's see if
you got the correct answer
the second time around.

12:55.834 --> 12:57.834
- 95.
- I wasn't finished,

12:57.834 --> 13:01.333
but all these
parenthesis and plus signs,
that a lot to digest.

13:01.333 --> 13:04.166
But I was just on
the left two numbers

13:04.166 --> 13:05.500
and I'm about
to hit plus,

13:05.500 --> 13:09.600
then 361, square root,
equals...

13:09.600 --> 13:13.133
95.
Wow.

13:15.066 --> 13:16.633
All right, gentlemen,
here comes

13:16.633 --> 13:18.834
your last
mathematical face-off.

13:21.100 --> 13:22.066
Whoa.

13:37.567 --> 13:42.433
12.94117647058823529.

13:43.633 --> 13:47.066
- Okay, stop.
- What?

13:48.934 --> 13:50.633
Okay, Andrew,
you said,

13:50.633 --> 13:54.533
12.941176
and a whole bunch
of other numbers.

13:54.533 --> 13:57.734
Are you right?
Let's take a look.

14:00.834 --> 14:02.900
That's amazing!

14:02.900 --> 14:03.800
Wow!

14:06.200 --> 14:07.600
That's incredible!

14:07.600 --> 14:10.967
- Dr. Jandial: That was awesome.
- That was awesome.

14:10.967 --> 14:12.600
Dude,
congratulations.

14:18.467 --> 14:20.100
Dr. Jandial, you know
more about the brain

14:20.100 --> 14:21.533
than pretty much
anyone on the planet.

14:21.533 --> 14:23.200
What's your reaction
to what you've just seen?

14:23.200 --> 14:24.934
Well, I got to give
the young man a lot
of credit, first of all.

14:24.934 --> 14:26.633
So I think
we should give him

14:26.633 --> 14:27.934
- a round of applause.
- Thank you.

14:30.300 --> 14:33.700
The place where
all of this raw calculation
happens in our brain

14:33.700 --> 14:35.066
is shaped
like a triangle.

14:35.066 --> 14:36.233
And what he's doing

14:36.233 --> 14:37.400
is seeing
with a occipital lobe,

14:37.400 --> 14:39.166
remembering with
the temporal lobe,

14:39.166 --> 14:41.000
and then processing it all
with the parietal lobe.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.400
Harnessing the power
of that link,

14:43.400 --> 14:45.433
that's where he's getting
his superhuman ability.

14:45.433 --> 14:48.333
Wow.

14:48.333 --> 14:50.000
Mike, you're obviously
great with your hands,

14:50.000 --> 14:51.266
you think
you could've done better

14:51.266 --> 14:53.700
- than Dr. Jandial?
- Oh, no way, Jose.

14:55.333 --> 14:58.166
What do you do for a living?
What do you do?

14:58.166 --> 14:59.834
I'm moving out to Vegas.

14:59.834 --> 15:01.333
I'm gonna gamble
with you, Iron Mike.

15:01.333 --> 15:03.033
- Yes, yes.
- Penn: There you go.

15:06.300 --> 15:07.500
Christina, do you believe
what you just saw?

15:07.500 --> 15:08.867
No, that was unbelievable.

15:08.867 --> 15:10.133
It was just
incredible to see

15:10.133 --> 15:11.467
how you
did that so quickly.

15:11.467 --> 15:13.967
I will say I was 14
when "Dip It Low" came out.

15:13.967 --> 15:15.100
I had a huge
crush on you.

15:15.100 --> 15:17.300
- You got me.
- Dip it low.

15:17.300 --> 15:21.100
Dip it, dip it, uh.
Dip it, ah.

15:21.100 --> 15:23.667
You get dip
for that.

15:23.667 --> 15:25.934
Congratulations, Andrew.

15:25.934 --> 15:27.200
At the end of the show,

15:27.200 --> 15:29.266
we'll see if Andrew
makes it to the top three

15:29.266 --> 15:33.266
and maybe wins $50,000
and the title of SuperHuman.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.600
Right now,
let's hear it for
Andrew Body.

15:35.600 --> 15:37.033
- Thanks, buddy.
Congratulations.
- Thank you, thank you.

15:37.033 --> 15:38.200
We'll see you
at the end of the show.

15:42.367 --> 15:44.900
There are 20 pairs
of doctors and nurses.

15:44.900 --> 15:47.266
Your job is to put
the original couples

15:47.266 --> 15:49.266
- back together again.
- That looks hard.

15:49.266 --> 15:50.900
My heart's pounding.

16:02.033 --> 16:04.033
Hey! Welcome back
to "SuperHuman"!

16:05.934 --> 16:08.000
Here's a contestant
who works in a hospital

16:08.000 --> 16:10.400
where she sees thousands
of faces every day.

16:10.400 --> 16:11.800
And do you know what?

16:11.800 --> 16:14.367
She can probably
recall every one.
Here's Amy Rice.

16:17.767 --> 16:19.800
I'm Amy Rice
and my superhuman ability

16:19.800 --> 16:21.533
is I am a
super recognizer.

16:21.533 --> 16:23.533
It's rare
that I forget a face.

16:23.533 --> 16:25.533
When I see someone
I recognize,

16:25.533 --> 16:27.867
I flip through
this sort of mental rolodex

16:27.867 --> 16:30.200
and I'll see someone
at the grocery store and say,

16:30.200 --> 16:33.367
"I know that person."
( flipping sounds )

16:33.367 --> 16:35.834
Ah, yes,
they were at the park
five years ago

16:35.834 --> 16:37.066
when my kid was two.

16:37.066 --> 16:39.367
I'm here
because of my kids.

16:39.367 --> 16:42.266
I think it's
extremely important

16:42.266 --> 16:44.567
to show my children
that I can do something

16:44.567 --> 16:46.333
that's genuinely
out of my comfort zone,

16:46.333 --> 16:48.567
but that I'm willing
to try my best at.

16:50.500 --> 16:53.266
From Boulder, Colorado,
please welcome Amy Rice.

17:00.166 --> 17:03.567
- Hi, Amy.
Welcome to "SuperHuman."
- Thank you.

17:03.567 --> 17:05.233
Amy, your kids are
in the audience today.

17:05.233 --> 17:06.900
- Yes.
- Where are they?

17:06.900 --> 17:08.400
Hi, guys.

17:08.400 --> 17:09.834
Welcome to
"SuperHuman."

17:09.834 --> 17:12.400
Amy, your challenge
is called

17:12.400 --> 17:13.900
Doctor's Orders.

17:13.900 --> 17:15.133
You're about to meet

17:15.133 --> 17:17.099
20 pairs
of doctors and nurses.

17:17.099 --> 17:18.599
As you're introduced
to each pair,

17:18.599 --> 17:21.733
take time to study
all their facial
characteristics.

17:21.733 --> 17:23.233
When you've seen
all 20 pairs,

17:23.233 --> 17:24.900
they'll split
and we'll mix them up.

17:24.900 --> 17:27.733
Your job will be
to recall all those
characteristics

17:27.733 --> 17:30.000
and place
the original pairings
back together.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.467
- Got it?
- Mm-hmm, yes.

17:31.467 --> 17:33.834
Okay. Amy, your challenge
starts...

17:33.834 --> 17:35.934
- now.
- ( bell dings )

17:38.834 --> 17:40.133
Okay,
send them in.

17:45.266 --> 17:46.266
Okay.

18:38.533 --> 18:39.500
Okay.

18:40.667 --> 18:42.333
Penn: Okay.

18:42.333 --> 18:45.200
Amy, you've seen
all 20 pairs

18:45.200 --> 18:46.734
of doctors and nurses.

18:46.734 --> 18:48.600
Now it's time for them
to split,

18:48.600 --> 18:50.100
and we'll mix them up.

18:50.100 --> 18:51.266
Doctors to the left,

18:51.266 --> 18:53.200
nurses to the right.

18:54.734 --> 18:56.266
My heart's pounding.

18:57.533 --> 19:00.300
Mm.
That looks hard.

19:01.734 --> 19:03.500
Amy, are you ready
to pair up

19:03.500 --> 19:04.734
the doctors
and nurses again?

19:04.734 --> 19:06.333
- I am.
- Okay.

19:06.333 --> 19:09.066
As you pair them up,
bring them front and center.

19:09.066 --> 19:11.266
If it's a match,
you'll hear this sound.

19:11.266 --> 19:12.800
( bell dings )

19:12.800 --> 19:14.533
Your goal
is to successfully pair

19:14.533 --> 19:17.633
all 20 doctors and nurses
back together.

19:17.633 --> 19:20.834
Okay.

19:20.834 --> 19:22.834
Okay.

19:22.834 --> 19:24.200
Come on.

19:28.233 --> 19:29.133
You.

19:31.934 --> 19:32.934
( ding )

19:34.767 --> 19:36.834
- Wow!
- Woo!

19:38.266 --> 19:39.467
You can come on out.

19:42.734 --> 19:43.967
Oh, here she is.

19:45.567 --> 19:47.567
- ( ding ) 
- Would you come on out?

19:51.033 --> 19:52.967
- Come on out. 
- ( ding )

19:52.967 --> 19:54.367
Come on out.

20:09.166 --> 20:10.200
You.

20:12.233 --> 20:13.200
( ding )

20:17.667 --> 20:18.967
You come on out.

20:18.967 --> 20:20.900
- You.
- ( ding )

20:20.900 --> 20:23.734
- You. You.
- ( ding )

20:23.734 --> 20:26.133
- You.
- ( ding )

20:26.133 --> 20:28.633
- She's doing it fast.
- You.

20:28.633 --> 20:29.867
She's moving like
it's no doubt in her mind.

20:29.867 --> 20:31.033
( ding )

20:31.033 --> 20:32.867
- You.
- ( ding )

20:32.867 --> 20:35.533
- You.
- ( ding )

20:36.734 --> 20:39.300
- You.
- ( ding )

20:40.600 --> 20:41.800
( ding )

20:43.000 --> 20:44.533
( ding )

20:44.533 --> 20:45.834
Wow.

20:45.834 --> 20:46.834
I love this.

20:46.834 --> 20:49.066
- You.
- ( ding )

20:50.934 --> 20:52.066
( ding )

20:52.066 --> 20:53.500
She's kicking butt.

20:53.500 --> 20:56.166
- You. You.
- ( ding )

20:58.200 --> 21:00.266
- You.
- ( ding )

21:00.266 --> 21:03.333
- SuperHuman.
- Yeah, I think so.

21:03.333 --> 21:04.767
You.

21:04.767 --> 21:06.133
( ding )

21:06.133 --> 21:09.333
- Thank you.
- Two more.

21:09.333 --> 21:10.667
( ding )

21:10.667 --> 21:12.166
I'm not sure about
these ones though.

21:12.166 --> 21:13.867
- ( Kal chuckles ) 
- ( ding )

21:13.867 --> 21:15.867
Right on!

21:19.467 --> 21:21.600
Congratulations.

21:21.600 --> 21:24.567
- Perfect score.
- Good job.

21:24.567 --> 21:25.767
What a huge
undertaking.

21:29.633 --> 21:31.500
That's incredible.

21:31.500 --> 21:34.000
Dr. Jandial,
does the recognition function

21:34.000 --> 21:35.667
reside in one area
of the brain?

21:35.667 --> 21:37.200
It does.
I love this one.

21:37.200 --> 21:38.300
I think
what she was doing

21:38.300 --> 21:39.867
was she was
covering up the faces.

21:39.867 --> 21:41.367
I think
she was taking
measurements.

21:41.367 --> 21:43.200
Like, the distance
between the eyes

21:43.200 --> 21:45.400
or one eye to the angle
of the mouth,

21:45.400 --> 21:47.433
and that mental toolbox
that she used for this,

21:47.433 --> 21:48.633
she put all
that information

21:48.633 --> 21:50.633
in this endless
photo album in her mind.

21:50.633 --> 21:52.967
That's called
the facial recognition area.

21:52.967 --> 21:55.500
- That was an epic display.
- Thank you.

21:58.767 --> 22:00.700
Penn: Mike, could you
have done

22:00.700 --> 22:02.767
- what Amy just did?
- Mike: Man, listen,
I'm in the house.

22:02.767 --> 22:04.166
I forget my kids
sometimes.

22:04.166 --> 22:05.767
I'm like, "Hey, uh..."

22:05.767 --> 22:07.700
I'm like,
"Hey, who the hell are you?
What're you doing here?"

22:07.700 --> 22:10.200
"Dad, I live here."
I don't know.

22:10.200 --> 22:13.300
All right, will Amy's
matchmaking skills

22:13.300 --> 22:15.734
win her $50,000?

22:15.734 --> 22:19.333
The panelists
will pick our top three
at the end of the show.

22:19.333 --> 22:20.400
One more time
for Amy Rice.

22:20.400 --> 22:22.400
Thank you, Amy.

22:22.400 --> 22:23.800
- Amy: Thank you so much.
- I appreciate it.
Really well done.

22:23.800 --> 22:24.700
- Thank you.
- That was amazing.

22:26.567 --> 22:28.533
Only two are real countries.

22:28.533 --> 22:31.967
The real countries
are 31 and 43.

22:31.967 --> 22:33.500
Are you sure about that?

22:41.967 --> 22:44.533
Penn: Welcome back
to "SuperHuman"!

22:44.533 --> 22:46.667
There are about
195 countries in the world,

22:46.667 --> 22:48.166
and this contestant

22:48.166 --> 22:50.233
has been to just about
all of them.

22:50.233 --> 22:51.967
She's Courtney McCullough.

22:54.800 --> 22:56.133
My name
is Courtney McCullough,

22:56.133 --> 22:58.800
and my superhuman ability
is geography.

22:58.800 --> 23:02.567
I first became interested
in geography and traveling
when I was a child.

23:02.567 --> 23:04.533
I saw a picture
of the Eiffel Tower

23:04.533 --> 23:07.433
and I knew
it was somewhere faraway,
I didn't know where--

23:07.433 --> 23:10.934
that was the door opener
to everything.

23:10.934 --> 23:13.600
I feel like
I am a citizen
of the world.

23:13.600 --> 23:15.600
I'm half Chinese,
I'm half Mexican,

23:15.600 --> 23:17.066
but I don't speak Chinese,

23:17.066 --> 23:18.400
I don't speak Spanish.

23:18.400 --> 23:20.233
I speak Hebrew,
but I'm not Jewish.

23:20.233 --> 23:21.533
And my last name
is McCullough

23:21.533 --> 23:23.867
which is an Irish last name
of my step-father

23:23.867 --> 23:26.033
who wasn't Irish.

23:26.033 --> 23:27.433
I feel like
all these elements
of who I am

23:27.433 --> 23:30.000
make me a well-rounded
cultured individual.

23:32.033 --> 23:34.667
From Los Angeles, California,
please welcome

23:34.667 --> 23:36.133
Courtney McCullough.

23:40.166 --> 23:41.533
Hello.

23:41.533 --> 23:42.967
- Nice to meet you, Courtney.
- Nice meeting you.

23:42.967 --> 23:44.700
- Welcome to "SuperHuman."
- Thank you.

23:46.266 --> 23:48.333
All right,
we've got the perfect

23:48.333 --> 23:50.133
globe-trotting
challenge for you.

23:50.133 --> 23:52.066
It's called
All Over the Map.

23:52.066 --> 23:54.233
Courtney,
up on the screen
behind us,

23:54.233 --> 23:55.734
you're going to see
a number of shapes

23:55.734 --> 23:57.166
that look like countries,

23:57.166 --> 23:59.767
but most of them
are fake.

23:59.767 --> 24:01.367
You'll have
to identify
the countries

24:01.367 --> 24:02.667
that are real.

24:02.667 --> 24:04.867
Of the 195 countries
in the world,

24:04.867 --> 24:06.934
100 of them have either
changed their names

24:06.934 --> 24:08.767
or adjusted their borders

24:08.767 --> 24:10.433
in the last 35 years.

24:10.433 --> 24:11.934
So, not only
do you need to be

24:11.934 --> 24:13.300
an expert
in world geography,

24:13.300 --> 24:16.100
you must also be
completely up-to-date.

24:16.100 --> 24:19.266
- Wow.
- Dr. Jandial,

24:19.266 --> 24:21.266
how detailed
does Courtney's knowledge

24:21.266 --> 24:23.166
need to be
in order to do this?

24:23.166 --> 24:24.500
Well, it's gotta
be phenomenal.

24:24.500 --> 24:26.066
I'll give you
a casual example
about it.

24:26.066 --> 24:30.400
Imagine somebody
gave you a jigsaw puzzle
with 195 pieces

24:30.400 --> 24:31.734
and then
Christina and Mike
came by

24:31.734 --> 24:34.734
and threw 5,000 fake pieces
on top of that table

24:34.734 --> 24:37.166
and then said, "Hey, tell us
which ones are real."

24:37.166 --> 24:39.233
That's how complicated
her challenge is gonna be.

24:39.233 --> 24:40.467
Wow.
All right.

24:41.800 --> 24:43.467
Courtney, would you
please take your position

24:43.467 --> 24:45.200
- in the SuperHuman chair.
- All right, Court.

24:47.600 --> 24:48.834
Okay.

24:51.800 --> 24:53.066
Your challenge starts...

24:53.066 --> 24:54.967
- now.
- ( ding )

24:59.266 --> 25:01.867
For round one,
there are ten shapes.

25:01.867 --> 25:04.600
Only two of them
are real countries.

25:10.867 --> 25:13.934
Okay, the real countries
are number

25:13.934 --> 25:16.967
three and eight.

25:16.967 --> 25:19.100
Penn:
Number three and eight?

25:19.100 --> 25:21.400
Okay, please
bring up the two shapes
that Courtney picked.

25:21.400 --> 25:23.233
First,
let's talk about three.

25:23.233 --> 25:24.567
You think
that this shape

25:24.567 --> 25:26.533
is the outline
of which country?

25:26.533 --> 25:29.066
This is Guyana.

25:29.066 --> 25:31.767
Penn:
Is shape number three
a real country?

25:31.767 --> 25:33.367
And is it Guyana?

25:33.367 --> 25:35.734
- ( ding ) 
- Guyana, it is.
 All right.

25:39.467 --> 25:40.633
Cool.

25:40.633 --> 25:42.066
What country
do you think shape

25:42.066 --> 25:43.867
- number eight is.
- Number eight

25:43.867 --> 25:47.200
is our favorite country
in the world...

25:47.200 --> 25:49.867
- Djibouti.
- Ooh, Djibouti.
Let's see if you're right.

25:49.867 --> 25:51.533
Is number eight Djibouti?

25:51.533 --> 25:53.900
- ( ding ) 
- Djibouti.

25:55.567 --> 25:56.900
Have you
been to Djibouti?

25:56.900 --> 25:58.667
I have not been
to Djibouti.

25:58.667 --> 26:01.233
- You been to Djibouti?
- I have. I have been
to Djibouti.

26:01.233 --> 26:03.967
And I bought
a T-shirt that said that
I was "all up in Djibouti."

26:05.800 --> 26:07.667
All up in there, dawg.

26:07.667 --> 26:09.533
Dr. Jandial:
 Oh!

26:12.667 --> 26:14.166
Penn:
Now we're gonna
move onto round two.

26:14.166 --> 26:15.500
It's gonna get
a little tougher.

26:15.500 --> 26:18.567
This time
you're going to see 25
countries outlines,

26:18.567 --> 26:20.100
23 of them are fake.

26:24.767 --> 26:28.100
Ooh, there's a lot
of good ones here.

26:31.100 --> 26:33.400
See, like number 12
is kinda throwing me off

26:33.400 --> 26:34.734
a little bit.

26:34.734 --> 26:36.900
Uh, it almost looks like
it could be France.

26:38.900 --> 26:41.233
I think I've spotted it.
Oh, this one's a lot of fun.

26:41.233 --> 26:44.066
Yes, okay.
So the real countries

26:44.066 --> 26:46.367
are number nine and 21.

26:46.367 --> 26:48.467
Let's pull up
nine and 21 please.

26:49.867 --> 26:51.433
First let's
talk about nine.

26:51.433 --> 26:53.266
So you think
this shape is actually

26:53.266 --> 26:54.567
the outline
of which country?

26:54.567 --> 26:56.900
Number nine
is the outline of Oman.

26:56.900 --> 26:59.100
All right, let's see
if number nine is Oman.

27:02.934 --> 27:04.200
- ( ding ) 
- You are correct.

27:04.200 --> 27:06.100
All right.

27:09.266 --> 27:10.433
Let's move onto
number 21.

27:10.433 --> 27:12.734
Number 21...

27:15.700 --> 27:17.900
is Laos.

27:17.900 --> 27:21.200
Let's see if,
uh, 21 is Laos.

27:21.200 --> 27:22.633
- ( ding ) 
- Laos.

27:27.400 --> 27:29.734
Courtney, here's
your ultimate test.

27:29.734 --> 27:33.400
We are now
going to show you
50 shapes...

27:33.400 --> 27:35.834
but only two of them

27:35.834 --> 27:37.667
- are real countries.
- Okay.

27:40.200 --> 27:41.533
Okay, there are a lot
of shapes here.

27:41.533 --> 27:43.567
Wow.

27:43.567 --> 27:44.967
Let's see.

27:48.133 --> 27:49.300
This is really challenging,

27:49.300 --> 27:51.300
and, uh,
as I go through the list,

27:51.300 --> 27:52.867
and I'm not
really finding a country,

27:52.867 --> 27:54.367
I start
to worry a little.

27:54.367 --> 27:57.300
Like,
surely I passed it
by now.

27:57.300 --> 27:59.967
Uh...

27:59.967 --> 28:01.467
Wow.

28:01.467 --> 28:03.133
Let's see.

28:03.133 --> 28:07.800
The real countries
are number 31...

28:07.800 --> 28:09.800
and 43.

28:09.800 --> 28:11.133
Let's isolate those
two countries please,

28:11.133 --> 28:13.734
31 and 43.

28:13.734 --> 28:15.400
First let's
talk about 31.

28:15.400 --> 28:18.667
Uh, which country
do you think this
is the shape of?

28:22.400 --> 28:24.033
Number 31 is Namibia.

28:24.033 --> 28:25.333
Let's see
if you're correct.

28:26.667 --> 28:28.166
- ( ding ) 
- It is Namibia.

28:28.166 --> 28:29.567
Oh, my God.

28:33.367 --> 28:35.000
Let's move onto
the right.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.767
Country 43.

28:36.767 --> 28:38.100
This is it.

28:38.100 --> 28:39.633
If you get this right,

28:39.633 --> 28:41.133
you'll be
a perfect six for six.

28:41.133 --> 28:44.800
Number 43 is Uzbekistan.

28:44.800 --> 28:48.000
Is it Uzbekistan?

28:51.066 --> 28:52.233
- ( ding ) 
- Nice.

28:52.233 --> 28:55.166
Oh, man!
Let's turn you
back around.

28:57.266 --> 28:59.400
That was awesome.

28:59.400 --> 29:01.800
That's amazing.

29:01.800 --> 29:05.500
Well, Thank you.
Thank you.

29:05.500 --> 29:08.000
That is really,
really incredible.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.266
Dr. Jandial, what's
the neurological process

29:10.266 --> 29:13.000
associated with
what Courtney just did?

29:13.000 --> 29:16.233
You know, let's go back
to caveman-- cavewomen days,

29:16.233 --> 29:18.967
before there were any lights
that we have now

29:18.967 --> 29:20.266
and people were living
with campfires,

29:20.266 --> 29:22.166
you had to be really good
at noticing silhouettes.

29:22.166 --> 29:24.500
Member of the tribe,
dangerous animal,

29:24.500 --> 29:26.333
that was our first
instinctive sort of thing

29:26.333 --> 29:27.667
that we needed to get done.

29:27.667 --> 29:28.834
The part of the brain
that does that

29:28.834 --> 29:30.400
is the parietal lobe.

29:30.400 --> 29:32.934
It's up here by the crown,
it's at the top of your head.

29:32.934 --> 29:36.000
It's used anytime
you rotate any image around.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.734
If you memorize the contours
and creases of any image,

29:38.734 --> 29:41.567
that's the part of the brain
that's really activated

29:41.567 --> 29:44.900
and that's where
her genius lays.

29:44.900 --> 29:46.367
Was that enough
for Courtney to win?

29:46.367 --> 29:49.533
The panelists
will choose our top three
and then our audience

29:49.533 --> 29:53.767
will determine who deserves
to walk away with the $50,000

29:53.767 --> 29:56.166
and the title of SuperHuman
at the end of the show.

29:56.166 --> 29:58.133
Right now,
let's hear it for
Courtney McCullough.

29:58.133 --> 29:59.834
- Courtney,
Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

29:59.834 --> 30:01.333
That was awesome.
I love that.

30:05.467 --> 30:09.734
52 cards to memorize.
Recall the exact order...

30:09.734 --> 30:12.233
- Come on.
- Ace of Spade-- ah, no.

30:12.233 --> 30:15.633
I wanna say...

30:24.467 --> 30:26.266
This superhuman contestant

30:26.266 --> 30:28.266
has a phenomenal
world-beating ability

30:28.266 --> 30:30.133
to store information.

30:30.133 --> 30:33.166
Unfortunately, I do not,
and I've forgotten his name.

30:33.166 --> 30:35.000
- ( laughter ) 
- Oh, yes.
 He's Alex Mullen.

30:39.567 --> 30:41.567
Hi, my name is Alex Mullen,
and my superhuman ability

30:41.567 --> 30:42.967
is memorization.

30:42.967 --> 30:46.834
I read a book that introduced me
to the techniques of memory

30:46.834 --> 30:48.500
and just started practicing
and getting better.

30:48.500 --> 30:49.967
And at that point,
it was kind of cool

30:49.967 --> 30:51.633
to be able to, you know,
do these things

30:51.633 --> 30:52.767
that not very many
people can do.

30:52.767 --> 30:54.233
My wife and I,
we are in med school,

30:54.233 --> 30:55.633
so we do have
to study a lot.

30:55.633 --> 30:56.967
So the way I use
the techniques,

30:56.967 --> 30:58.367
I'll turn those things
into images

30:58.367 --> 31:00.367
and that helps me remember
those details better.

31:00.367 --> 31:02.533
So Kathy and I first met
when we were in pre-school.

31:02.533 --> 31:03.834
We're definitely
high school sweethearts.

31:03.834 --> 31:05.066
Shortly thereafter,

31:05.066 --> 31:06.233
I figured she was
the love of my life.

31:06.233 --> 31:08.066
So we got married
last August.

31:08.066 --> 31:11.734
If my wife is at my side,
I'm definitely a happy person.

31:11.734 --> 31:15.233
From Jackson, Mississippi,
please welcome Alex Mullen.

31:18.667 --> 31:20.133
Hey, man.
Welcome to "SuperHuman."

31:20.133 --> 31:21.400
- Thank you.
- How're you doing?

31:21.400 --> 31:24.433
- I'm doing good.
- Your wife Kathy is here.

31:24.433 --> 31:25.600
- Right.
- Yes she is, yeah.

31:25.600 --> 31:27.967
Uh, Kathy, welcome
to "SuperHuman."

31:31.900 --> 31:35.200
All right, Alex,
we've got a superhuman
challenge for you.

31:35.200 --> 31:37.533
It's called
In the Cards.

31:37.533 --> 31:39.233
We're gonna show you
an entire deck

31:39.233 --> 31:40.233
of 52 playing cards

31:40.233 --> 31:41.734
two at a time.

31:41.734 --> 31:45.066
Each pair of cards
will only be onscreen
for a moment.

31:45.066 --> 31:47.066
Your job
is to memorize
the order,

31:47.066 --> 31:48.800
because you'll
have to recall it

31:48.800 --> 31:51.800
in exactly
the same sequence
it was revealed.

31:51.800 --> 31:53.400
- Got it?
- I got it.

31:53.400 --> 31:55.233
Dr. Jandial,
in scientific terms,

31:55.233 --> 31:57.133
what makes
this a particularly
difficult challenge?

31:57.133 --> 31:59.533
Well, it's not
just gonna be numbers,
the cards have symbols,

31:59.533 --> 32:01.100
they have letters,

32:01.100 --> 32:03.266
and he's gonna have to do it
lightning quick,

32:03.266 --> 32:05.300
that's what's
gonna make him special
if he gets it done.

32:05.300 --> 32:06.800
Here we go.

32:06.800 --> 32:08.300
Alex, please
take your position

32:08.300 --> 32:09.800
in the SuperHuman chair.

32:12.166 --> 32:15.333
Now remember,
you'll have to recall
the exact order

32:15.333 --> 32:17.300
as it was revealed.

32:17.300 --> 32:19.000
- You ready to play cards?
- Let's do it.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.533
52 cards to memorize.

32:21.533 --> 32:23.166
Alex,
your challenge starts...

32:23.166 --> 32:24.600
- now.
- ( ding )

32:40.467 --> 32:41.867
Come on.

33:25.166 --> 33:27.500
Okay. I think I--
I think I have it.

33:27.500 --> 33:29.000
Let's--
let's give it a shot.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.700
Penn:
All right, let's get you
turned around.

33:37.700 --> 33:40.433
Alex, please recite
the exact order

33:40.433 --> 33:42.200
of all 52 cards.

33:42.200 --> 33:43.867
All right.

33:43.867 --> 33:46.300
That was--
that was a little fast.

33:46.300 --> 33:48.100
Um, let's get

Whoa!

37:07.934 --> 37:09.967

37:09.967 --> 37:11.633
I'm-- I want to check

I'm like, "Are you a robot?"
You are superhuman.

37:14.033 --> 37:15.333
- For sure.

Thank you very much.

37:15.333 --> 37:17.433
Dr. Jandial,
How much brain activity

37:17.433 --> 37:18.834
was going on
in Alex's brain
during that time?

37:18.834 --> 37:20.500
Well, I'm gonna
give it to you technical.

37:20.500 --> 37:22.633
He's in medical school,
so what he was doing

37:22.633 --> 37:24.967
was transferring numerical
and visual information

37:24.967 --> 37:26.667
from his occipital
and frontal lobes

37:26.667 --> 37:29.100
to his hippocampi
and mammillary bodies.

37:29.100 --> 37:30.500
Translation,

37:30.500 --> 37:32.834
he's the heavyweight champion
of the memory world.

37:32.834 --> 37:34.767
Wow.

37:36.400 --> 37:38.633
So, is that
superhuman skill

37:38.633 --> 37:39.900
enough for Alex to win?

37:39.900 --> 37:42.300
Our panel
and our audience

37:42.300 --> 37:44.133
will determine that
after the break.

37:44.133 --> 37:47.400
Right now,
one more time
for Alex Mullen.

37:47.400 --> 37:48.567
Thanks, man.

38:02.100 --> 38:03.233
Tonight,

38:03.233 --> 38:05.867
we've seen five
ordinary people do some

38:05.867 --> 38:08.033
truly spectacular things.

38:08.033 --> 38:10.667
And now it's all gonna
pay off for one of them.

38:10.667 --> 38:13.667
As $50,000

38:13.667 --> 38:18.367
and the title of SuperHuman
is on the line.

38:18.367 --> 38:19.900
First, the panel

38:19.900 --> 38:22.834
is going to pick their
top three contestants.

38:22.834 --> 38:24.233
So, guys,
please talk it over.

38:24.233 --> 38:26.400
While they
makeup their minds,

38:26.400 --> 38:27.834
here's a look back
at the five

38:27.834 --> 38:29.734
amazing people
we've seen tonight.

38:32.667 --> 38:34.000
Turn right,
take one step,

38:34.000 --> 38:36.066
two steps forward
and take a right,

38:36.066 --> 38:37.600
- jump out of the maze.
- Wee!

38:40.633 --> 38:41.834
Here comes
the equation.

38:41.834 --> 38:43.033
104.

38:43.033 --> 38:44.200
It should've been 95.

38:44.200 --> 38:46.633
- 12.941...
- That is correct.

38:50.900 --> 38:52.066
- You.
- Penn: That is correct.

38:52.066 --> 38:54.900
- You.

Perfect score.

38:58.233 --> 39:00.834
Number 31 is Namibia.

39:00.834 --> 39:03.066

39:03.066 --> 39:04.400
Laos.
Oman.

39:04.400 --> 39:06.400
- Guyana.
- Nice!

39:08.000 --> 39:09.367
And...

39:09.367 --> 39:11.800
Ace of Spades.
Two of Spades.

39:11.800 --> 39:14.100
- Ten of Clubs.
- You got 'em!

39:17.266 --> 39:19.567
Okay, panel,
this is it.

39:23.834 --> 39:25.700
Mike,

39:25.700 --> 39:29.100
who is the first contestant
in our top three?

39:29.100 --> 39:31.500
When you combine them
with the three of us...

39:38.834 --> 39:40.834
I decided to pick
Alex Mullen.

39:47.867 --> 39:49.734
Mike, why did
you choose Alex?

39:49.734 --> 39:51.333
Because what he did
was amazing.

39:51.333 --> 39:53.133
And remembering
the cards

39:53.133 --> 39:55.633
and I'm just thinking about
bringing these guys to Vegas

39:55.633 --> 39:57.467
and we can make a killing.

39:57.467 --> 39:59.233
This is really
good stuff.

39:59.233 --> 40:01.266
Now you see me,
now you don't.

40:01.266 --> 40:03.100
Three.

40:03.100 --> 40:05.533
Christina, who's next
in your top three?

40:05.533 --> 40:06.967
So our next pick

40:06.967 --> 40:08.300
was somebody I think

40:08.300 --> 40:09.767
we were all really
excited about.

40:09.767 --> 40:10.967
I think we were excited
about everybody.

40:10.967 --> 40:12.400
But we just
loved his energy

40:12.400 --> 40:14.400
when he jumped in here

40:14.400 --> 40:15.500
with-- yes--

40:15.500 --> 40:16.834
you know who
I'm talking about.

40:16.834 --> 40:19.834
David.
David, you are amazing.

40:19.834 --> 40:21.800
Thank you.

40:23.834 --> 40:25.900
Dr. Jandial,
there is one spot left
in the top three.

40:25.900 --> 40:27.934
Who's taking it?

40:27.934 --> 40:29.166
Everybody should
feel like a winner,

40:29.166 --> 40:30.934
but we can
only pick three.

40:30.934 --> 40:31.867
The last person is...

40:34.567 --> 40:36.967
Courtney McCullough,
geography.

40:42.633 --> 40:44.633
You know,
we talked about it.

40:44.633 --> 40:46.333
This stuff
was really hard.

40:46.333 --> 40:48.100
Dr. Jandial:
Yeah, it was a difficult,
difficult, difficult thing.

40:48.100 --> 40:50.433
They all should be here.
It's just tough.

40:50.433 --> 40:52.433
You know, it's not just
memorizing the countries,

40:52.433 --> 40:54.667
she had to memorize
every corner, every bend,

40:54.667 --> 40:57.066
and every crease
of every country.

40:57.066 --> 40:58.400
We thought
that was very special.

40:58.400 --> 40:59.734
It's a big world.

40:59.734 --> 41:01.400
- Penn: All right.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.667
Now, the power passes
to the audience.

41:13.667 --> 41:15.300

for our winner.

41:15.300 --> 41:20.000
