01:42.402 --> 01:44.927
What do you hear? What do you say?

01:48.108 --> 01:49.575
Welcome home.

01:49.909 --> 01:53.436
Youngstown, my ass. Look at this guy.
You look like you were in Miami.

01:53.546 --> 01:56.845
- Yeah, you look like you were in Miami.
- Good to be home, skip.

01:56.916 --> 01:58.713
What can I get you, Paulie?

01:58.785 --> 02:01.310
After four months inside? How about laid?

02:05.358 --> 02:07.826
- It's Papillon.
- Hello, Sil, how are you?

02:07.894 --> 02:10.020
I heard you were getting laid all the time.

02:10.096 --> 02:12.587
- Come here, you little prick.
- Hello, Chrissy.

02:12.665 --> 02:15.896
Let's have a drink.
Come on, pass them back.

02:17.470 --> 02:19.700
- Hey, over here.
- There you go.

02:21.074 --> 02:22.541
All you guys!

02:22.609 --> 02:23.906
<i>Salute.</i>

02:25.845 --> 02:27.335
Just a second.

02:49.702 --> 02:50.896
My song.

02:53.306 --> 02:54.773
Welcome home.

02:57.177 --> 02:58.405
Come on.

02:59.846 --> 03:01.143
What the fuck?

03:01.214 --> 03:03.079
Why is this his song?

03:03.149 --> 03:06.414
Paulie, say hello to Brian Cammarata,
Carm's cousin.

03:06.486 --> 03:07.851
He's a financial guy.

03:07.921 --> 03:09.286
How you doing, kid?

03:09.756 --> 03:11.587
So, just back from college?

03:13.893 --> 03:16.361
Let me talk to Paulie for a sec, all right?

03:16.429 --> 03:18.090
Nice meeting you.

03:18.765 --> 03:20.198
Have a seat.

03:22.769 --> 03:24.168
How you doing? You okay?

03:24.237 --> 03:28.003
Just thank God that piece of shit from
Youngstown finally copped to that gun.

03:28.074 --> 03:31.532
I could've been wearing
an orange jumpsuit till I'm 90.

03:32.579 --> 03:35.742
Well, you're home now,
that's the important thing.

03:35.815 --> 03:37.942
Here, get back on your feet.

03:38.418 --> 03:39.749
Thanks, T.

03:41.054 --> 03:43.454
Not that I don't appreciate it...

03:43.523 --> 03:46.185
but I could've used a boost
when I was gone, too.

03:46.259 --> 03:47.624
Fucking bills.

03:48.294 --> 03:50.626
Then there's Ma with the private home care.

03:50.697 --> 03:53.188
You know she almost lost her spot
at Green Grove?

03:53.266 --> 03:56.565
An extra $5,000 it cost me
just to hold her place.

03:56.636 --> 03:59.434
You're here 30 seconds,
you already got a fistful of cash...

03:59.505 --> 04:02.497
not to mention the no-show jobs
I got for you.

04:02.909 --> 04:05.844
- You're right, Ton'. I know.
- Enjoy the party.

04:05.912 --> 04:07.106
I will.

04:21.194 --> 04:23.492
<i>Were you having dinner at Citris last year...</i>

04:23.563 --> 04:26.657
<i>when a man threw a drink
in Richard Cross' face?</i>

04:27.533 --> 04:28.591
<i>Yes.</i>

04:28.668 --> 04:30.533
<i>Subsequent to that incident...</i>

04:30.603 --> 04:33.197
<i>did Mr. Cross telephone Rusty Arnold?</i>

04:33.706 --> 04:34.764
<i>Yes.</i>

04:35.375 --> 04:36.808
<i>And the folowing day...</i>

04:36.876 --> 04:39.538
<i>were you informed
that the man in question...</i>

04:39.612 --> 04:41.910
<i>had suffered a fractured skul?</i>

04:42.048 --> 04:43.777
<i>Your honor, objection.</i>

04:43.850 --> 04:46.148
<i>This whole line of questioning is irrelevant.</i>

04:46.219 --> 04:48.949
<i>Overruled. You may answer, Miss Costelo.</i>

04:50.223 --> 04:52.418
<i>l don't think l'm supposed to, Judge.</i>

04:52.492 --> 04:55.689
<i>l just made my ruling,
you are required to answer.</i>

04:56.596 --> 05:00.498
<i>But isn't there some law about testifying
against your husband?</i>

05:00.667 --> 05:01.998
<i>Excuse me?</i>

05:03.069 --> 05:06.630
<i>Richard and l were married
the night before last in Reno.</i>

05:07.840 --> 05:09.171
<i>Your honor...</i>

05:09.242 --> 05:12.268
<i>the defense requests
a conference in chambers.</i>

05:13.913 --> 05:15.938
<i>We'l stand in recess for 15 minutes...</i>

05:16.015 --> 05:18.984
<i>while the court confers
with counsel in chambers.</i>

05:19.052 --> 05:21.020
<i>Bailiff, wil you escort the jury out?</i>

05:21.087 --> 05:23.783
<i>Did she say anything to you about this?</i>

05:28.061 --> 05:31.553
<i>What we saw in that courtroom
is a transparent attempt by Richard Cross...</i>

05:31.631 --> 05:34.725
<i>to subvert the intent of the marital privilege.</i>

05:34.801 --> 05:36.564
<i>Hey, she's his wife.</i>

06:06.065 --> 06:07.794
Where are my pants?

06:09.435 --> 06:11.596
There's some mouthwash
and shit in the back.

06:11.671 --> 06:13.195
We'll go get breakfast.

06:13.272 --> 06:15.297
<i>Oh, aspetta, I'll go with you.</i>

06:16.476 --> 06:20.469
Any investment advice for
an ambitious young man such as myself?

06:20.546 --> 06:23.515
Buy land, I guess.
God ain't making any more of it.

06:23.583 --> 06:25.744
That's what Will Rogers said.

06:25.818 --> 06:28.548
It's true, my house is worth
nearly triple what I paid.

06:28.621 --> 06:32.421
Location's the key, right?
Otherwise you get stuck with shit.

06:32.558 --> 06:34.890
Sometimes there's money in shit.

06:35.361 --> 06:37.022
How do you mean?

06:38.131 --> 06:41.396
- Nothing, I don't know.
- We're just talking here, come on.

06:41.901 --> 06:45.598
I don't know. Some guy
I went to school with, this black guy...

06:45.671 --> 06:49.368
we worked one summer for this
not-for-profit housing group.

06:49.442 --> 06:53.310
Told me about some scam his minister
was involved with up in Harlem.

06:53.379 --> 06:55.040
I read about this.

06:55.648 --> 06:57.843
Forgazee Mortgage Loans
or something, right?

06:57.917 --> 07:00.943
- Actually, you ever hear of HUD?
- Housing development, yeah.

07:01.020 --> 07:04.979
HUD was set up to help minorities
and low-income families to be homeowners.

07:05.057 --> 07:08.117
There are more programs
for these deadbeats, I swear to Christ.

07:08.194 --> 07:11.357
If the feds guarantee the home mortgage,
the banks figure, why not?

07:11.431 --> 07:12.898
They'll loan the money.

07:12.965 --> 07:15.832
You get a front man to buy houses
in some crummy neighborhood.

07:15.902 --> 07:19.804
Talking about some real shitboxes.
Maybe they're worth $100,000 apiece.

07:20.940 --> 07:24.876
Next, you tie up with some
non-profit organization who goes to HUD...

07:24.944 --> 07:27.606
and says they intend
to buy these houses from your stooge.

07:27.680 --> 07:31.480
They're gonna convert them to homes
for working-class blacks, blah-blah-blah.

07:31.751 --> 07:33.378
Thing is, though...

07:44.530 --> 07:46.521
All right, sit tight. I'm gonna be a while.

07:46.599 --> 07:48.260
I'll be over here.

08:18.498 --> 08:22.400
Maurice and I met in college.
All the way to the University of Michigan...

08:22.468 --> 08:25.266
to make friends with a guy
who lived 20 blocks away from me.

08:25.338 --> 08:28.899
You should've seen the Jew-fro
on this guy. Out to here.

08:29.041 --> 08:33.000
So, Maurice, Ron tells me
you're from down Roseville Street.

08:33.546 --> 08:35.912
<i>My father was a typesetter
for the Star-Ledger.</i>

08:35.982 --> 08:37.210
No shit?

08:37.717 --> 08:40.777
- Sixth and Orange.
- Then we were practically neighbors.

08:40.852 --> 08:42.912
Yeah, that's why he moved.

08:59.438 --> 09:02.407
- Hello.
- Carmela, it's me, Furio.

09:02.542 --> 09:05.705
I guess I missed you this morning,
I was in the bathtub.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.370
The reason I call...

09:08.447 --> 09:11.473
I leave my sunglasses
in some place, I don't know.

09:11.551 --> 09:14.384
You're kidding. Let me have a look around.

09:16.556 --> 09:19.150
So how is everything? How's your dad?

09:20.326 --> 09:21.725
Not so good.

09:22.562 --> 09:25.156
But I get the pictures
from the housewarm finally.

09:25.231 --> 09:27.358
Good, bring them next time.

09:27.433 --> 09:28.661
<i>l wil.</i>

09:29.001 --> 09:31.663
There's a pretty one of you.

09:33.205 --> 09:34.672
That's sweet.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.604
<i>l don't see the glasses, Fur'.</i>

09:41.480 --> 09:43.778
That's okay, I probably leave them home.

09:43.849 --> 09:44.873
<i>Al right.</i>

09:44.951 --> 09:46.919
If I find them, I'll give you a call.

09:46.986 --> 09:48.112
Okay.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.113
I see you soon.

09:58.130 --> 10:00.963
The summer of '67,
we're both home on break.

10:01.033 --> 10:05.197
I'm interning at the state legislature
and he... What were you doing?

10:07.306 --> 10:09.638
- East Newark Food Co-op.
- Right.

10:10.076 --> 10:12.306
But come July...

10:12.378 --> 10:14.471
The Newark riots.

10:14.947 --> 10:17.074
What a fucking summer that was.

10:17.149 --> 10:21.142
Later that year, Maurice and I helped
organize one of the first black voting drives.

10:21.220 --> 10:24.280
Maurice, were you around
for Anthony Imperiale?

10:24.423 --> 10:26.653
- The White Knight?
- Around?

10:27.126 --> 10:31.392
- Who do you think he was fighting against?
- "Italian pride, keep Newark white. "

10:31.931 --> 10:34.161
Aspiring Klansmen, some of those boys.

10:34.233 --> 10:36.895
So this group you got now,
the Urban Housing League.

10:36.969 --> 10:38.402
What's the story there?

10:38.471 --> 10:40.462
Like many non-profits...

10:41.474 --> 10:43.442
we've fallen on hard times.

10:43.709 --> 10:46.439
Republican administration,
plus a proliferation...

10:46.512 --> 10:48.241
of new charities post 9l11.

10:48.314 --> 10:51.545
Sounds like you got a lot to talk about.
I'm gonna hit the showers.

10:51.617 --> 10:53.642
Maurice, nice meeting you.

10:54.220 --> 10:55.551
Same here.

10:57.990 --> 11:00.925
I took the liberty of filling Maurice in
on the broad strokes.

11:00.993 --> 11:04.292
Okay, we got a guy,
Dr. Fried, he's a urologist.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.465
We'll give him $500,000 of our money.

11:06.532 --> 11:09.194
Have him grab up these four houses
on Garside Street...

11:09.268 --> 11:10.860
for $125,000 apiece.

11:10.936 --> 11:12.062
The old First Ward.

11:12.138 --> 11:14.971
Once we own the houses,
we got an appraiser who'll play ball.

11:15.041 --> 11:18.238
He's gonna re-appraise them
in the $300,000 range.

11:18.811 --> 11:21.712
What you do, Maurice,
is take the phony appraisals to HUD.

11:21.781 --> 11:24.978
Tell them your urban housing thing wants
to buy up these shitholes.

11:25.051 --> 11:27.986
Convert them to low-cost housing
for working families.

11:28.054 --> 11:31.217
Once HUD guarantees the mortgage app,
you take it to the bank.

11:31.290 --> 11:34.088
They cut a check, and we work it up nice.

11:35.428 --> 11:39.262
At which point, I assume my organization
fails to make the mortgage payment.

11:39.331 --> 11:42.357
Unforeseen construction delays
and repeated vandalism...

11:42.435 --> 11:44.596
force the project into dissolution.

11:44.670 --> 11:46.501
We all walk away from the houses.

11:46.572 --> 11:49.200
Your cut'll be in the 10 percent
of the profit range.

11:49.275 --> 11:53.336
My office'll write a letter in strong support
of your application.

11:53.412 --> 11:55.141
Sounds about right.

12:02.088 --> 12:03.487
Tony, good.

12:04.056 --> 12:05.717
You're still here.

12:07.126 --> 12:10.459
- Is there a problem?
- No problem, I just wanna talk to you.

12:12.264 --> 12:14.732
You remember that time in Atlantic City?

12:14.800 --> 12:16.825
You brought Irina, your old girlfriend?

12:16.902 --> 12:20.065
Yeah, the cystic fibrosis thing,
the fundraiser.

12:21.874 --> 12:22.932
God.

12:23.809 --> 12:25.401
This is awkward.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.736
Irina and I are seeing each other.

12:27.813 --> 12:28.871
What?

12:29.648 --> 12:31.172
You're fucking kidding me.

12:31.250 --> 12:34.185
I met her that night at the fundraiser.
I gave her my card.

12:34.253 --> 12:36.278
She was having some problem
with her landlord.

12:36.355 --> 12:39.290
She called me months later,
after you two broke it off...

12:39.358 --> 12:42.350
- one thing led to another...
- All right, take it easy.

12:42.428 --> 12:44.225
It's ancient history.

12:46.732 --> 12:49.565
I wanted to tell you.
I feel like I owe you an explanation.

12:49.635 --> 12:52.468
What am I, her father? You're both adults.

12:52.605 --> 12:53.902
Enjoy yourself.

12:53.973 --> 12:56.498
It's more than that. I care for her.

12:57.009 --> 12:59.603
Very deeply. Roz and I are separated.

13:00.446 --> 13:03.244
The heart wants
what the heart wants, I guess.

13:03.315 --> 13:06.113
The heart also wants what the dick wants.

13:06.585 --> 13:08.917
Okay, who's gonna scrub my back?

13:10.489 --> 13:12.514
Ralph, you steal my water?

13:12.591 --> 13:14.582
<i>Oh, girl</i>

13:15.795 --> 13:18.923
<i>l'd be in trouble if you left me now</i>

13:22.134 --> 13:24.068
Man, I love this song.

13:24.370 --> 13:25.860
The Chi-Lites.

13:26.372 --> 13:27.634
The best.

13:28.974 --> 13:32.239
Believe it or not, The Chi-Lites
were signed to the same label...

13:32.311 --> 13:34.506
as Tommy James and them damn Shondells.

13:34.580 --> 13:37.515
See, a lot of people think that,
but they're wrong.

13:37.583 --> 13:39.710
Chi-Lites were on Brunswick.

13:42.288 --> 13:43.755
See you soon.

13:45.891 --> 13:47.518
So, Tony, anyway...

13:47.927 --> 13:49.918
Look, she's a great girl.

13:50.095 --> 13:52.393
Beautiful girl, a little needy.

13:53.299 --> 13:56.291
Frankly, I'm glad to have her off my payroll.

13:56.735 --> 13:58.464
Thanks for understanding.

13:58.537 --> 14:01.062
Wish you nothing but the best, bro.

14:09.114 --> 14:11.810
Dr. Fried, you are now the legal owner.

14:11.917 --> 14:13.817
Eat my dust, Donald Trump.

14:23.462 --> 14:25.953
- Hey, Adriana.
- Jesus Christ!

14:26.398 --> 14:28.457
Why don't you go
haunt a house or something?

14:28.534 --> 14:30.502
It's been a while, figured I'd check in.

14:30.569 --> 14:32.469
So you crawl up my ass?

14:35.741 --> 14:37.709
What do you want, Robyn?

14:38.143 --> 14:40.839
I heard Paulie Gualtieri's out of jail.

14:41.213 --> 14:44.046
- What do I know?
- How does Christopher feel about that?

14:44.116 --> 14:46.949
Christopher likes Paulie, they're friends.

14:47.086 --> 14:49.077
Is that a crime now, too?

14:51.924 --> 14:55.018
How is Christopher anyway?
He looked tired last time I saw him.

14:55.094 --> 14:57.255
If you're gonna turn me into a traitor, fine...

14:57.329 --> 15:01.060
but do me a favor and stop asking
about him like you give a shit how he is.

15:01.133 --> 15:03.761
How is he doing with his drug problem?

15:04.670 --> 15:06.968
He doesn't have a drug problem.

15:07.806 --> 15:09.706
How are you doing, Ade?

15:12.044 --> 15:13.238
Really.

15:13.779 --> 15:16.339
I'm fine. We're both fine.

15:18.584 --> 15:22.486
As a matter of fact,
we're thinking of finally getting married.

15:26.392 --> 15:28.485
You have a good time today?

15:28.794 --> 15:31.319
Yeah, it was cool. I love the ocean.

15:37.236 --> 15:39.204
Feel like taking a ride?

15:42.207 --> 15:43.799
See that church?

15:45.210 --> 15:48.907
Your great grandfather helped
build that almost 80 years ago.

15:48.981 --> 15:50.505
He was a stonemason, the old man.

15:50.582 --> 15:53.813
Came over from Avellino
with $4 in his pocket.

15:53.886 --> 15:56.855
Yeah, but I saw in a book
where you could get a hotel room...

15:56.922 --> 15:58.913
for, like, 10 cents a week then.

15:58.991 --> 16:02.188
Room service must've been,
like, one or two cents a meal.

16:02.261 --> 16:03.728
Room service?

16:03.862 --> 16:05.853
We're talking about history here, A.J.

16:05.931 --> 16:08.491
Your family's history. Newark's history.

16:08.567 --> 16:11.866
- Who gives a shit about Newark?
- I'm making a point.

16:12.972 --> 16:15.031
This neighborhood used to be beautiful.

16:15.107 --> 16:17.041
Hundred percent Italian.

16:17.109 --> 16:19.509
The 1920s, most of them right off the boat.

16:19.578 --> 16:23.070
Most Italians couldn't even
find a church that wanted them.

16:23.148 --> 16:24.979
So what did they do, did they cry?

16:25.050 --> 16:28.042
Did they go to the government
with their hand out? No.

16:28.921 --> 16:30.548
They took care of their own problems.

16:30.622 --> 16:34.649
They said, "You don't want us here? Fine.
We'll build our own, a better one. "

16:34.727 --> 16:36.820
Look at all these buildings around here.

16:36.895 --> 16:39.295
Most of them are falling down
into the ground.

16:39.365 --> 16:41.526
But that church is still standing.

16:41.600 --> 16:43.067
You know why?

16:43.736 --> 16:45.101
The bricks?

16:47.339 --> 16:50.172
'Cause our people give a shit, that's why.

16:50.509 --> 16:53.603
Every Sunday, Italians from
the old neighborhood drive miles...

16:53.679 --> 16:55.510
to come here to pray.

16:55.714 --> 16:57.477
They keep this place alive.

16:57.549 --> 16:59.744
So how come we never do?

17:02.688 --> 17:06.055
Buy land, A.J.,
'cause God ain't making any more of it.

17:08.961 --> 17:12.192
This is advice I'm imparting to you
as your father.

17:34.987 --> 17:36.249
Now what?

17:39.525 --> 17:41.049
Are you afraid?

17:41.927 --> 17:45.192
Right, like I haven't seen places
like this before.

17:49.435 --> 17:51.562
See those houses over there?

17:55.040 --> 17:56.632
I'm buying them.

17:56.708 --> 17:59.040
Those crappy ones? What for?

17:59.478 --> 18:01.139
For an investment.

18:01.280 --> 18:03.248
What have I been saying?

18:03.315 --> 18:04.612
I don't know.

18:04.683 --> 18:06.878
Real estate. Buy real estate.

18:11.523 --> 18:13.957
Dad, the black dude's coming over.

18:16.795 --> 18:18.660
- Hey, what's up?
- What's up?

18:19.264 --> 18:20.356
Five-O?

18:20.432 --> 18:22.923
Yeah, I'm Starsky and this is Hutch.

18:23.302 --> 18:24.894
Smoke, crack, or crank?

18:24.970 --> 18:27.302
No, thank you,
we're just having a look around.

18:27.372 --> 18:30.705
- No eyeing if you ain't buying, man.
- Thought this was a free country.

18:30.776 --> 18:34.337
Unless you want something, motherfucker,
get the fuck off our street.

18:34.413 --> 18:36.210
The language on you.

18:36.281 --> 18:39.842
- You blow your father with that mouth?
- What the fuck you say to my sister?

18:39.918 --> 18:43.251
Relax, I don't want trouble.
I'm showing my son the old neighborhood.

18:43.322 --> 18:46.519
This is our neighborhood now.
Guinea motherfucker.

18:48.660 --> 18:50.457
Yeah, I can see that.

18:56.535 --> 18:58.469
So that's a crack ho.

18:59.238 --> 19:02.571
Keep your fucking cracker ass off
my motherfucking block!

19:02.641 --> 19:03.938
Come on, ease up.

19:04.676 --> 19:06.871
She's really gonna marry him?

19:07.079 --> 19:09.741
- What is wrong with this girl?
- Come on.

19:09.815 --> 19:11.680
Moltisanti's a great catch.

19:11.750 --> 19:13.843
Tall, dark, and sociopathic.

19:15.988 --> 19:19.981
From a strategic standpoint,
do the nuptials help us or hurt us?

19:21.760 --> 19:23.250
If they do get married...

19:23.328 --> 19:25.319
brings them closer, obviously.

19:25.898 --> 19:28.662
And by extension, gets her closer to Tony.

19:28.734 --> 19:31.430
It could cause her to stop cooperating.

19:31.503 --> 19:33.562
The guilt becomes overwhelming.

19:33.639 --> 19:35.163
Remember Angel Diletto?

19:35.240 --> 19:37.800
I think it's more likely
to have the opposite effect.

19:37.876 --> 19:40.606
His problems really become her problems.

19:41.580 --> 19:44.572
If they have kids, that's even more pressure.

19:44.950 --> 19:46.508
The Dilettos never had kids.

19:46.585 --> 19:48.553
I wouldn't count on children.

19:48.620 --> 19:51.248
She's had some issues. Female trouble.

19:52.624 --> 19:54.353
Maybe Darwin was right.

19:54.426 --> 19:56.656
Nature really does weed out the nimrods.

19:56.728 --> 19:58.787
So what do we do, people? Yay or nay?

19:58.864 --> 20:00.832
Supportive or discouraging?

20:00.899 --> 20:04.426
If anyone objects to this marriage,
speak now or forever hold your peace.

20:04.503 --> 20:06.232
I say neutral or supportive.

20:06.305 --> 20:09.274
Even if we discourage it,
she'll go through with it anyway.

20:09.341 --> 20:11.866
Agreed then. They have our blessing.

20:12.444 --> 20:14.207
To the happy couple.

20:23.455 --> 20:25.946
These doctors own so much property.

20:28.360 --> 20:31.557
You're going to buy four houses
on Garside Street?

20:32.631 --> 20:35.395
You've certainly
got your work cut out for you.

20:35.467 --> 20:36.866
One day at a time.

20:36.935 --> 20:38.664
Keep on keeping on.

21:10.035 --> 21:11.900
Tony. Come on in.

21:15.641 --> 21:19.771
You know, it really would've been better
if we met over at Denny's.

21:20.979 --> 21:24.073
What are you worried about?
I was in the neighborhood.

21:24.149 --> 21:25.275
So, what's up?

21:25.350 --> 21:28.080
Can I get you something? Scotch, right?

21:31.556 --> 21:34.525
I sent some of my guys down there
to start gutting the place.

21:34.893 --> 21:37.088
Turned out one of the houses
was a crack den.

21:37.162 --> 21:38.754
- So?
- What, "so"?

21:39.298 --> 21:42.631
- We got to get them out of there.
- Why didn't your guys roust them?

21:42.701 --> 21:46.137
Oh, nice. Bunch of white guys
setting off caps in the ghetto.

21:46.204 --> 21:48.399
That won't attract any attention at all.

21:49.708 --> 21:53.200
- What do you want me to do?
- Exert some influence, make some calls.

21:53.278 --> 21:56.247
Get the donut squad to go down there
and roust the shitbags.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.306
Tony, it's not that easy...

21:59.751 --> 22:01.150
Hello, Tony.

22:04.623 --> 22:06.352
How you doing, hon?

22:06.425 --> 22:07.915
I'm very good.

22:09.961 --> 22:11.622
No, I'm very well.

22:11.963 --> 22:13.760
Thanks you very much.

22:13.832 --> 22:17.768
She's taking a class at the community
college, English as a Second Language.

22:22.407 --> 22:23.874
You sound great.

22:26.511 --> 22:29.571
Ronnie, I'll go make some lunch,
some egg salad?

22:29.648 --> 22:31.377
Great. You hungry?

22:31.450 --> 22:32.439
No.

22:33.352 --> 22:35.183
Go light on the mayo.

22:43.995 --> 22:46.486
Look, when you're dealing
with squatters' rights...

22:46.565 --> 22:49.363
or anything having
to do with the homeless...

22:49.434 --> 22:50.799
it can get very tricky.

22:50.869 --> 22:53.565
Homeless? They're a bunch
of fucking crackheads.

22:53.638 --> 22:55.799
I understand they're gumming up the works.

22:55.874 --> 22:58.934
But try to see the big picture.
The HUD approval came through.

22:59.010 --> 23:01.740
In two weeks, we're gonna
be looking at a huge windfall.

23:01.813 --> 23:05.749
See, that's why you're a politician
and not a businessman.

23:06.385 --> 23:08.785
Maximum value is the big picture.

23:09.721 --> 23:13.953
There must be $7,000 of copper pipe
in there, if they haven't taken it out already.

23:14.025 --> 23:16.619
I still don't know
what you expect me to do about it.

23:16.695 --> 23:18.560
Okay, all right.

23:20.098 --> 23:22.066
We'll take the $7,000 out of your end?

23:22.134 --> 23:24.329
- Well, no, but...
- Come on, Ronnie.

23:24.603 --> 23:26.503
University of Michigan.

23:26.838 --> 23:28.703
Fucking figure it out.

23:34.513 --> 23:36.174
Good dinner, baby.

23:43.221 --> 23:44.620
Christopher.

23:46.591 --> 23:48.582
- Let's get married.
- Whoa!

23:50.996 --> 23:52.361
Where'd this come from?

23:52.431 --> 23:53.830
I don't know.

23:53.899 --> 23:56.527
It's gonna be two years we're engaged.

23:56.802 --> 23:58.895
Let's just go down to City Hall.

23:58.970 --> 24:00.301
City Hall?

24:00.739 --> 24:02.604
<i>What are we, schwugs?</i>

24:02.707 --> 24:05.505
You said you wanted a big wedding anyway.

24:05.577 --> 24:07.772
I don't care about that shit.

24:08.447 --> 24:09.744
I just want you.

24:10.816 --> 24:13.808
It'll be cheaper anyway,
we could buy a house.

24:15.220 --> 24:17.950
Plus, a wife...

24:18.023 --> 24:20.491
can't testify against her husband.

24:26.231 --> 24:30.463
You can't have a club, stay out all night
getting high when you have a kid.

24:40.412 --> 24:41.936
What if we didn't have kids?

24:42.013 --> 24:44.072
Fuck that!
What's the point of being married?

24:44.149 --> 24:46.049
I mean, what if we can't?

24:46.117 --> 24:47.482
If I can't?

24:48.253 --> 24:50.244
Would you still love me?

24:51.790 --> 24:53.883
Of course I'd still love you.

24:55.994 --> 24:57.052
Why?

25:05.036 --> 25:07.470
There's something you should know.

25:10.942 --> 25:13.172
A long time ago, years ago...

25:13.678 --> 25:15.737
I had a medical procedure.

25:16.381 --> 25:18.178
It was before we met.

25:19.551 --> 25:21.416
My uterus got pierced.

25:22.521 --> 25:24.853
- Both of them?
- There's only one.

25:25.423 --> 25:26.549
That's ovaries.

25:26.625 --> 25:29.059
So what does that mean?
You can't get pregnant?

25:29.127 --> 25:31.288
My doctor said it might be hard.

25:31.363 --> 25:33.854
A friend gave me the name
of a specialist in Manhattan.

25:33.932 --> 25:37.766
You knew you were damaged goods
and you never fucking told me?

25:39.137 --> 25:40.604
How could you call me that?

25:40.672 --> 25:43.732
Jesus fucking Christ!
How could you lie to me like that?

25:43.808 --> 25:46.436
I tried to tell you once. I wanted to.

25:46.645 --> 25:49.045
I was afraid that you wouldn't propose.

25:49.114 --> 25:50.547
You don't get it, Adriana.

25:50.615 --> 25:54.449
I don't have a son,
the Moltisanti name ends! That's it!

25:54.519 --> 25:56.749
- We could adopt.
- Yeah, that's great!

25:56.821 --> 25:59.449
Some kid with chinky eyes called Moltisanti!

25:59.524 --> 26:01.389
He'd get his ass kicked every day!

26:01.459 --> 26:03.051
You said you'd still love me.

26:03.128 --> 26:05.926
That doesn't mean I'll fucking marry you!

26:19.578 --> 26:21.910
She's a great girl, Christopher.

26:22.080 --> 26:24.310
You don't want to lose this one.

26:25.917 --> 26:27.248
T's right.

26:27.619 --> 26:29.780
You could have more kids
than the Kennedys...

26:29.854 --> 26:32.118
if you're married to some twat,
what good is it?

26:32.190 --> 26:34.249
Gotta have balance in a relationship.

26:34.326 --> 26:35.691
I know all that.

26:35.860 --> 26:38.055
But what if the kid thing never happens?

26:38.129 --> 26:40.427
Come on, medicine today? Technology?

26:42.300 --> 26:44.029
You want my advice?

26:44.636 --> 26:47.628
And this is nothing
about Ade or anybody else.

26:48.006 --> 26:49.997
Stay single as long as you can.

26:50.342 --> 26:52.003
Come on, what are you saying?

26:52.077 --> 26:56.070
No offense, but ask me,
marriage and our thing don't jive.

26:56.681 --> 26:58.308
Everybody we know is married.

26:58.483 --> 26:59.745
Not everybody.

27:01.786 --> 27:03.549
You love her, right?

27:03.655 --> 27:05.247
Yeah. You know.

27:06.324 --> 27:08.019
Then do the right thing.

27:08.460 --> 27:11.623
When the shoe was on the other foot,
your spleen...

27:11.997 --> 27:13.726
she stood by you, right?

27:15.700 --> 27:17.895
Do you want to end up
like my uncle Junior?

27:17.969 --> 27:19.869
Or worse, like Paulie?

27:23.008 --> 27:23.997
Exactly.

27:30.782 --> 27:32.181
All right, thanks.

27:32.484 --> 27:34.145
I've got to think about it.

27:34.219 --> 27:35.379
All right.

28:44.723 --> 28:46.088
- Ron!
- Hi, Lenore.

28:46.424 --> 28:47.448
What a nice surprise.

28:47.525 --> 28:49.755
We're overdue for that dinner, the four of us.

28:49.828 --> 28:52.228
- We absolutely are.
- Here they come.

28:52.297 --> 28:54.492
We're late for practice. He's in the den.

28:54.566 --> 28:56.033
Okay, thanks.

29:02.407 --> 29:05.342
The fact is, Mo, these people are criminals.

29:05.543 --> 29:08.808
Drug addicts and dealers
who've been occupying that house illegally.

29:08.880 --> 29:12.839
What about the police? Get the seller,
the urologist, to make the call.

29:12.917 --> 29:15.977
They're crack addicts.
They'll be back there living in two hours.

29:16.054 --> 29:19.387
The deal was for me to effectuate
the purchase of these houses, period.

29:19.457 --> 29:20.515
I realize that.

29:20.592 --> 29:22.753
Nobody mentioned anything about violence.

29:22.827 --> 29:24.852
We renounced it, remember?

29:25.196 --> 29:27.562
Then Eldridge went
into the codpiece business.

29:27.632 --> 29:28.963
I'm in a bind here.

29:29.033 --> 29:30.762
What do you expect me to do?

29:31.002 --> 29:33.903
- Get some of your people to handle it.
- What people?

29:33.972 --> 29:36.167
Well, we can't send whites in there.

29:36.641 --> 29:37.733
People of color.

29:37.809 --> 29:40.539
You run a youth gang outreach program,
don't you?

29:41.346 --> 29:44.110
- I'm on the board, Ron.
- Fine, I understand.

29:44.215 --> 29:47.116
Take the $7,000 this is costing
out of your end then.

29:47.185 --> 29:48.345
Come on.

29:48.419 --> 29:51.013
You know what I pay in child support
to my first wife.

29:51.089 --> 29:54.991
The chances I'm taking with this.
I'm putting it all on the line if I get caught.

29:55.059 --> 29:58.859
Get some kids, gangbangers, whatever,
you throw them some money.

29:59.097 --> 30:01.622
When you think about it
from a policing standpoint...

30:01.699 --> 30:03.997
it's one group of recidivists
beating on another.

30:04.068 --> 30:05.797
Stop trying to justify it.

30:06.271 --> 30:08.034
It's about the $7,000.

30:14.412 --> 30:16.175
Let me tell you something else.

30:16.247 --> 30:19.774
Guys like Tony, you don't fool around
with these people.

30:30.595 --> 30:31.789
My son...

30:33.598 --> 30:35.498
I don't know what he understands.

30:35.567 --> 30:39.594
I'm trying to tell him about the immigrants.
He's talking about room service.

30:39.671 --> 30:42.606
We need to talk about
your recent behavior in here.

30:44.742 --> 30:48.007
- Your angry tirade?
- You want to talk about that now?

30:48.613 --> 30:49.910
That was weeks ago.

30:49.981 --> 30:54.645
It was my judgment that at the time
you were in crisis about Gloria's suicide.

30:58.323 --> 30:59.950
Didn't you get the flowers I sent?

31:00.024 --> 31:02.390
Your behavior was unacceptable, Anthony.

31:03.027 --> 31:07.225
You cannot have these outbursts
and expect to redeem yourself...

31:07.298 --> 31:08.959
with an FTD bouquet.

31:09.934 --> 31:11.424
I'm sorry, all right?

31:11.970 --> 31:15.235
It's good that you're sorry,
but no, it's not all right.

31:15.540 --> 31:17.633
We've been down this road before.

31:17.742 --> 31:19.004
I know.

31:19.444 --> 31:21.935
The fact that you're angry is fine.

31:22.547 --> 31:24.913
And it's okay to talk about your anger.

31:25.283 --> 31:28.411
But when it manifests itself in physicality...

31:28.786 --> 31:30.879
it becomes unacceptable.

31:31.089 --> 31:32.750
I never laid a finger on you.

31:32.857 --> 31:33.983
You loomed.

31:34.792 --> 31:38.353
- You threw my tissue holder.
- Then I picked it up.

31:42.867 --> 31:44.164
I was very upset.

31:44.235 --> 31:46.396
- You lied to me.
- I did not lie to you.

31:46.471 --> 31:49.998
You withheld information
about a very sensitive subject.

31:52.343 --> 31:53.935
All right, look.

31:54.646 --> 31:57.080
I know what I did was wrong. Okay?

31:59.083 --> 32:01.051
And you may not believe this...

32:01.119 --> 32:05.647
but I did exercise impulse control,
and I have been controlling my anger.

32:06.457 --> 32:09.688
This thing with my son,
I went to show him the old neighborhood...

32:09.761 --> 32:11.888
and we got accosted by these crackheads.

32:11.963 --> 32:15.126
One of them had a gun.
The other one threw a bottle at my car.

32:15.199 --> 32:19.033
Now it may not sound like much,
but I let it go. I drove away.

32:19.604 --> 32:22.971
Well, in the future,
I'll ask that you extend to me...

32:23.241 --> 32:25.903
the same courtesy you would a crack addict.

32:35.687 --> 32:39.919
All right, as long as we're
being truthful here, you know, opening up?

32:40.558 --> 32:44.824
I've been holding a grudge against you
for recommending that Wendi Kobler...

32:45.163 --> 32:47.131
that half-assed adolescent shrink.

32:47.198 --> 32:50.361
That stupid bitch
almost sent my daughter to Barcelona.

32:55.606 --> 32:57.870
You're right, it's no excuse.

33:00.979 --> 33:04.346
<i>l knew l hit something last night
when l turned off the road.</i>

33:06.584 --> 33:08.313
<i>Up and at them, Lieutenant.</i>

33:08.386 --> 33:09.785
<i>How was your ride?</i>

33:10.054 --> 33:11.487
<i>Busted brake line.</i>

33:11.990 --> 33:15.255
<i>- Yeah, what's it look like?
- Like a busted brake line, man.</i>

33:15.994 --> 33:17.359
<i>Good morning, honey.</i>

33:17.428 --> 33:20.488
<i>- Can you fix it, B.A.?
- Gonna try. Thanks, Hannibal.</i>

33:21.065 --> 33:22.123
<i>l need those.</i>

33:22.200 --> 33:24.134
<i>What do you need my tools for?</i>

33:24.736 --> 33:28.797
<i>Going to get my hands on the tape
that'l prove Calvin Cutter's a murderer.</i>

33:28.940 --> 33:30.931
<i>l won't leave the county without proof.</i>

33:31.009 --> 33:34.240
<i>The tape won't do us good
if we can't get out of the county with it.</i>

33:44.922 --> 33:47.288
Listen, I've been doing some thinking...

33:47.525 --> 33:49.117
the kid thing and all.

33:49.894 --> 33:52.089
I'm not happy that you lied to me.

33:52.830 --> 33:55.993
But I think I want to try and deal with it.

33:58.669 --> 33:59.658
Really?

34:01.606 --> 34:03.096
I love you, Adriana.

34:03.808 --> 34:05.400
I want you in my life.

34:06.010 --> 34:08.205
I love you, too, Christopher.

34:19.157 --> 34:20.487
Are you high?

34:20.925 --> 34:23.155
You gotta start with that now?

34:23.527 --> 34:26.224
- I just want to be sure it's real.
- It is real.

34:27.098 --> 34:28.463
I love you.

34:35.473 --> 34:37.338
When can we get married?

34:37.608 --> 34:40.634
I was thinking maybe our anniversary,
we could go to Vegas.

34:51.422 --> 34:54.721
Vegas? Want to get married
by some Elvis impersonator?

34:55.226 --> 34:58.354
- We would save money at least.
- No, it's a sacrament, Ade.

34:58.429 --> 35:01.125
Why don't we have it here?
All your friends could come.

35:01.432 --> 35:05.334
We'll have it in the great room,
or in the yard even, if it's nice out.

35:05.403 --> 35:06.961
We can have Artie cater it.

35:07.038 --> 35:09.472
I think Christopher will ask Tony
to be his best man.

35:09.540 --> 35:11.474
I am sure he will be honored.

35:11.542 --> 35:14.477
- Does your mother know?
- You're the first person I've told.

35:14.545 --> 35:17.013
We'll decorate the whole house with mums.

35:17.115 --> 35:19.310
Believe me, you will
not save any money in Vegas.

35:19.383 --> 35:22.819
My cousin Jackie and her husband Tommy,
$60,000 at blackjack.

35:25.323 --> 35:27.416
- I'm getting married!
- I know!

35:37.935 --> 35:39.425
Give me some of that.

35:53.217 --> 35:56.345
Remember, just shoot the ceiling and shit.
No 187 s.

36:35.560 --> 36:37.824
Get the fuck out my house, motherfuckers!

36:41.199 --> 36:42.723
Get out and stay out!

36:48.306 --> 36:49.967
Hey, mister.

36:50.675 --> 36:52.973
I'll kill you if you come around here, bitch.

36:53.144 --> 36:54.736
Don't come back here no more.

36:54.812 --> 36:57.337
Get the fuck out before we kill your asses!

37:10.861 --> 37:12.385
Fucker's got a. 9 mm!

37:21.072 --> 37:22.164
All right.

37:28.246 --> 37:30.407
Don't come around here no more.

37:39.991 --> 37:41.390
That's my brother.

37:47.999 --> 37:50.433
Get out of here, you filthy bitch!

37:58.376 --> 37:59.502
Go!

38:05.650 --> 38:09.984
I told you young people
that crack is some bad shit.

38:23.801 --> 38:25.894
Dr. Fried, $1,300,000.

38:26.370 --> 38:29.032
Mr. Tiffen, you take possession as of today.

38:30.608 --> 38:33.372
Good luck now, and congratulations.

38:33.511 --> 38:35.172
Thank you, Doctor.

38:52.730 --> 38:53.719
For you.

38:53.831 --> 38:56.356
- What's this?
- It's a music box.

39:00.137 --> 39:01.468
Holy shit.

39:02.139 --> 39:03.197
A Patek?

39:03.507 --> 39:06.874
Yeah, me and Ralph got lucky
on a new real estate investment.

39:07.511 --> 39:09.001
You actually did it?

39:09.480 --> 39:12.108
- I was just speculating. I never...
- Relax.

39:12.216 --> 39:15.413
- Your name will never come up.
- It's not that, it's just...

39:15.486 --> 39:16.919
The American taxpayers...

39:16.987 --> 39:20.423
They pay for airport security,
look how well that's going.

39:20.491 --> 39:22.186
Give me a fucking break.

39:24.495 --> 39:28.431
This is like a $15,000 watch, Tony.
I can't take this.

39:28.499 --> 39:30.967
It's just a little thank you, that's all.

39:31.135 --> 39:33.501
A.J., what are you doing down there?

39:33.604 --> 39:36.368
It's me, Carm! Down here with Bri'.

39:37.108 --> 39:39.599
- I'm just borrowing some tools.
- All right.

39:42.747 --> 39:44.544
Thank you for this, really.

39:45.116 --> 39:46.879
I gotta get dressed.

40:05.736 --> 40:08.534
- Furio, hi, good morning.
- Good morning.

40:09.673 --> 40:11.698
Come in.
What are you doing out in the cold?

40:11.776 --> 40:13.801
Today I'll wait in the car, I think.

40:14.812 --> 40:16.609
Why? Don't you want some coffee?

40:16.680 --> 40:19.046
The motor is acting funny.

40:20.084 --> 40:22.882
I need to keep my foot on the gas pedal.

40:23.888 --> 40:25.014
Well, okay.

40:25.256 --> 40:27.952
I was looking forward
to seeing those pictures.

40:30.895 --> 40:32.886
I'll let Tony know you're here.

40:46.944 --> 40:48.172
Furio's here.

40:49.413 --> 40:51.404
You doing some work on the house?

40:52.950 --> 40:56.545
Yeah, you know.
Sinking some anchors for a wall mirror.

41:10.935 --> 41:12.129
Thank you.

41:13.838 --> 41:15.203
How's the mousse?

41:15.706 --> 41:17.071
Fucking great.

41:18.175 --> 41:19.403
I tell you...

41:20.778 --> 41:23.110
the shit you miss when you're inside?

41:23.180 --> 41:26.877
There was a week where I would've killed
for some Good & Plentys.

41:27.751 --> 41:29.412
Should've told me.

41:29.753 --> 41:31.482
I would've sent you some.

41:32.089 --> 41:33.852
I know you would've.

41:34.558 --> 41:38.016
See, that's the thing though.
What I need's not your problem.

41:39.897 --> 41:41.956
- What do you mean?
- Fucking Tony.

41:42.800 --> 41:45.735
Four months I'm up there,
like the Man in the Iron Mask.

41:45.803 --> 41:48.567
Not one visit. Not even a fucking phone call.

41:49.173 --> 41:52.870
- The guy didn't reach out at all?
- When do I ever complain?

41:54.144 --> 41:56.942
Paulie, look, the guy's the boss.

41:58.649 --> 42:01.049
You visit a guy in the can these days...

42:01.519 --> 42:02.986
You know the feds.

42:03.654 --> 42:07.215
You give someone the time of day,
it's a criminal conspiracy.

42:07.458 --> 42:09.688
So he can't phone? You fucking did.

42:11.862 --> 42:15.798
Even before I left, he was treating me
like the ugly girl at the dance.

42:16.333 --> 42:20.292
I'm sucking wind, and he's rolling in it
with that fucking Christ killer.

42:20.404 --> 42:21.393
Hesh?

42:21.472 --> 42:23.872
Fucking Zellman, fucking real estate scam.

42:24.975 --> 42:27.068
The Frelinghuysen Avenue thing.

42:28.312 --> 42:29.939
We had some words.

42:30.714 --> 42:33.649
- Tony made it right.
- It's a different one now.

42:34.118 --> 42:36.086
I'm not sure what it is.

42:36.153 --> 42:40.681
All I know is fucking Ralphie's going around
bragging about how much they're making.

42:50.501 --> 42:53.436
Listen, John, I know we talk sometimes.

42:53.904 --> 42:56.873
I tell you my problems, you tell me yours.

42:57.041 --> 42:59.407
I have the highest regards for Carmine.

42:59.476 --> 43:01.535
He thinks the world of you, also.

43:01.612 --> 43:04.877
Even still, this shit
don't leave the table, right?

43:05.849 --> 43:08.010
I'm hurt that you even have to ask.

43:15.659 --> 43:18.890
As far as we know,
those transformers are perfectly safe...

43:18.963 --> 43:21.454
but I'll propose an ad-hoc study.

43:21.532 --> 43:23.898
- Thank you, assemblyman.
- Okay, bye-bye.

43:26.937 --> 43:31.397
Mr. Olmstead called regarding lunch,
and you've got the zoning hearing at 4:00.

43:35.846 --> 43:38.212
I'll call him later, I'm going to make a stop.

43:38.282 --> 43:42.616
I'll see you back at the office and make sure
that she's on the list for the fundraiser.

43:48.626 --> 43:52.585
- Does this go your cousins?
- No, Verrazano Salvage, ask for Gene.

43:52.997 --> 43:55.795
Don't forget the fireplace mantles
and the wall sconces.

43:55.866 --> 43:57.959
Downtown, the yuppies pay top dollar.

43:58.035 --> 43:59.969
We're on it, Ton', don't worry.

44:03.574 --> 44:07.066
Assemblyman. What brings you
to beautiful downtown Newark?

44:07.144 --> 44:09.237
Meeting with one of my constituents.

44:09.313 --> 44:12.544
- You going to be at the Bing tomorrow?
- I don't know yet.

44:13.217 --> 44:15.378
Maybe I'll see you over there then.

44:15.653 --> 44:17.177
Maybe you will.

44:25.696 --> 44:28.096
Is it going to be a nice house here now?

44:43.547 --> 44:44.673
I'm taking it.

44:44.748 --> 44:47.114
I'll put it on my card, okay?
It's with my clothes.

44:47.184 --> 44:48.879
I'll get the seamstress.

44:49.687 --> 44:53.316
I can't believe you're finally doing this.
So sudden, too.

44:53.524 --> 44:57.051
The best part is going to be seeing
how much people give us.

44:57.227 --> 45:01.220
Lisa told me at her and Ricky's wedding,
Bobby Canzoneri didn't cover his plate.

45:01.298 --> 45:02.424
Shut up.

45:02.499 --> 45:05.332
$40 in an envelope, not even a card.

45:05.969 --> 45:08.938
I'll tell you, though,
the main thing about getting married?

45:09.006 --> 45:11.099
I can never be called to testify.

45:11.175 --> 45:12.301
What do you mean?

45:12.376 --> 45:15.209
- A wife can't testify against her husband?
- Right.

45:16.146 --> 45:19.240
Actually, though,
I don't think that's actually true.

45:19.550 --> 45:20.574
What do you mean?

45:20.651 --> 45:23.017
<i>They did a whole Murder, She Wrote
about that.</i>

45:23.087 --> 45:26.386
This butler thought his wife
couldn't testify against her husband...

45:26.457 --> 45:29.255
but it turns out, legally she actually could.

45:36.233 --> 45:39.168
To claim marital privilege,
three conditions must be met.

45:39.236 --> 45:42.296
The communication must be made
during the course of the marriage.

45:42.372 --> 45:45.034
Anything said before you were married
is fair game.

45:45.109 --> 45:48.010
Two, the communication
must involve only the spouses.

45:48.078 --> 45:50.478
The presence of a third party
destroys the privilege.

45:50.547 --> 45:53.380
Three, communication can't be made
in furtherance of a crime.

45:53.450 --> 45:57.318
Oh, my God, it's a simple question.
Can they make me testify or not?

45:57.521 --> 45:59.148
The short answer?

45:59.957 --> 46:00.946
Probably.

46:01.291 --> 46:05.421
In organized crime, a RICO, the feds
will spend a fortune putting on their case.

46:05.496 --> 46:09.193
Believe me, if they want you to testify,
they're going to find a way.

46:11.235 --> 46:13.965
Here you go, 10 percent apiece.

46:14.772 --> 46:16.967
Technically, it's a little less...

46:17.040 --> 46:20.168
but our friend rounded you up
to an even $60,000.

46:23.080 --> 46:25.207
There's plenty more where that came from.

46:25.282 --> 46:28.615
A lot of poor families
need affordable housing in Newark.

46:40.130 --> 46:41.893
Ronnie, listen...

46:43.100 --> 46:45.091
I didn't want to say this.

46:45.936 --> 46:48.496
- No hard feelings?
- Of course not.

46:50.207 --> 46:52.505
- You sure you're all right?
- I'm fine.

46:52.576 --> 46:54.373
You're just being...

46:55.279 --> 46:58.476
- You're being awfully quiet.
- I don't know, tired.

47:02.486 --> 47:05.580
- You ever feel bad about any of this?
- What do you mean?

47:05.656 --> 47:08.056
When I think about where we started out...

47:09.326 --> 47:11.760
I used to think what I did made a difference.

47:11.829 --> 47:15.026
The anti-drug programs, the voter drives.

47:15.632 --> 47:17.156
But over the years...

47:17.234 --> 47:19.998
it's like shoveling shit
against the tide, you know that.

47:20.070 --> 47:21.298
I guess.

47:24.341 --> 47:28.209
You cut corners, but you help out.
Do the best you can.

47:29.046 --> 47:32.948
If it ain't us, it's going to be somebody else.
Really, I mean...

47:33.183 --> 47:35.947
What are we supposed to be,
the only honest men?

47:36.453 --> 47:38.444
We were going to lead a revolution.

47:39.056 --> 47:40.250
Revolution.

47:41.158 --> 47:43.490
The revolution got sold, Ronnie.

47:44.127 --> 47:46.322
You heard the Beatles for H&R Block?

47:46.496 --> 47:49.329
Sometimes I feel like I should be punished.

47:50.100 --> 47:52.625
Come on, let's get something to eat.

47:55.806 --> 47:58.707
Here's something I never thought I'd say:

47:58.876 --> 48:00.901
To the federal government.

48:02.246 --> 48:04.373
Depends on which department.

48:15.459 --> 48:17.654
A cappuccino maker, this is great.

48:18.128 --> 48:20.596
Is that the Capresso? You'll love that, Ade.

48:20.898 --> 48:23.594
Cappuccino now. He used to drink Bosco.

48:23.834 --> 48:26.564
I got it at Fortunoff's
if you want to exchange it.

48:34.811 --> 48:37.245
No scissors, bad luck!

48:49.259 --> 48:50.248
That's from me.

48:50.327 --> 48:53.763
I can't count how many cheese melts
I've made for Silvio in that thing.

48:59.036 --> 49:00.765
Here, open this one, Ade.

49:35.839 --> 49:38.672
<i>Oh, girl</i>

49:39.343 --> 49:42.904
<i>l'd be in trouble if you left me now</i>

49:43.413 --> 49:47.076
<i>'Cause l don't know where to look for love</i>

49:50.153 --> 49:52.713
<i>Oh, girl</i>

50:36.566 --> 50:38.397
You got anything to drink?

50:52.482 --> 50:53.847
What's going on?

50:55.952 --> 50:57.044
What's up?

51:02.592 --> 51:05.561
Look, why don't you just calm down and...

51:05.729 --> 51:06.821
I'm perfectly calm.

51:06.897 --> 51:09.161
We can talk about whatever's bothering you.

51:09.232 --> 51:10.722
Tony, this is crazy.

51:15.505 --> 51:17.063
Come on, fuck!

51:17.207 --> 51:18.367
Tony, no!

51:29.486 --> 51:32.512
All the girls in New Jersey,
you had to fuck this one?

51:34.624 --> 51:36.717
Go ahead, cry like a bitch.

52:00.350 --> 52:01.339
Ronnie.

52:02.305 --> 52:08.841
