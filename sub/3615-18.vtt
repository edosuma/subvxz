WEBVTT

00:26.709 --> 00:29.484
All right, it should be
around here somewhere.

00:29.584 --> 00:32.317
And you can't be more precise
about what it is?

00:32.417 --> 00:34.401
Okay, I told you,
it's some sort
of evilly thing.

00:34.501 --> 00:37.067
(<i>sighs</i>):
Why did I let you
talk me into this thing?

00:37.167 --> 00:38.567
I should be at home
procrastinating

00:38.667 --> 00:41.067
my delinquent ethics paper,
not chasing

00:41.167 --> 00:41.983
some wild goose.

00:42.083 --> 00:42.899
Wild demon, okay,

00:42.999 --> 00:44.983
and I was scrying for
unnatural activity,

00:45.083 --> 00:47.899
and this place came
up loud and clear.

00:47.999 --> 00:48.983
Wait a minute.

00:49.083 --> 00:51.359
Are you telling me
you're actually looking

00:51.459 --> 00:52.484
for trouble now?

00:52.584 --> 00:53.275
Prue, what happened

00:53.375 --> 00:55.484
to putting more balance
in your life?

00:55.584 --> 00:57.692
You know, less Wicca wonder,
more Prue?

00:57.792 --> 01:00.526
Listen, I shot a magazine
cover yesterday,

01:00.626 --> 01:01.329
I had a date last night,

01:01.339 --> 01:03.234
and then this morning,
I'm searching for evil.

01:03.334 --> 01:04.245
You can't get more
balanced than that.

01:04.254 --> 01:06.899
Right, just your typical,
everyday Cosmo girl.

01:06.999 --> 01:08.609
Well, you and Piper
don't need me anymore,

01:08.709 --> 01:11.192
so that leaves me
plenty of time to
help those who do.

01:11.292 --> 01:14.818
Is that what you think,
that we don't need you anymore?

01:14.918 --> 01:15.899
Well, I-I mean,

01:15.999 --> 01:17.818
it's just that ever
since Piper got married

01:17.918 --> 01:18.899
and you hooked
up with Cole,

01:18.999 --> 01:20.275
I feel like I don't
have to watch out

01:20.375 --> 01:21.567
for you guys
as much anymore.

01:21.667 --> 01:23.983
Prue, this is
a good thing.

01:24.083 --> 01:26.542
Yeah.

01:27.709 --> 01:29.734
I think that's it.

01:29.834 --> 01:30.204
Good.

01:30.214 --> 01:32.192
PRUE:
All right, on the
count of three.

01:32.292 --> 01:34.150
One, two...

01:34.250 --> 01:36.818
PHOEBE:
Oh, my God!

01:36.918 --> 01:39.025
It's the coffee maker
I wanted.

01:39.125 --> 01:41.275
Phoebe, it's
just a carton.

01:41.375 --> 01:43.899
Oh. Right.

01:43.999 --> 01:44.899
Of course.
See, I need you.

01:44.999 --> 01:45.818
You just protected me

01:45.918 --> 01:47.401
from making a fool
out of myself.

01:47.501 --> 01:50.859
Now, there's a
full-time job.

01:50.959 --> 01:52.734
Thank you very much.

01:52.834 --> 01:53.567
Hey, so, how's Cole?

01:53.667 --> 01:54.526
I haven't seen him
in a while.

01:54.626 --> 01:57.899
Oh, he's been dodging
demonic bounty hunters,

01:57.999 --> 01:58.859
you know,
but he still manages

01:58.959 --> 02:01.692
to shimmer into the bedroom
when he has a chance.

02:01.792 --> 02:04.317
Pops in and then pops
right back out,

02:04.417 --> 02:05.692
if you know
what I'm talking about.

02:05.792 --> 02:06.942
(<i>laughs</i>):
I vaguely remember.

02:07.042 --> 02:09.442
And even though
I'm really happy to see him,

02:09.542 --> 02:12.317
it's starting to raise
old issues for me,

02:12.417 --> 02:14.859
like does he really love me,

02:14.959 --> 02:18.899
or is he just interested
in my... charms?

02:18.999 --> 02:19.899
Oh, Phoebe, come on.

02:19.999 --> 02:21.192
You know for
a magical fact

02:21.292 --> 02:23.359
that he loves you,
all right?

02:23.459 --> 02:24.359
And think about
how many times

02:24.459 --> 02:25.651
he risked his life
to save you.

02:25.751 --> 02:26.899
I don't think
that's just sex.

02:26.999 --> 02:30.899
Yeah, but what if it was
really, really great sex?

02:30.999 --> 02:31.899
Well...

02:31.999 --> 02:33.459
(<i>man shouting</i>)

02:34.167 --> 02:35.900
Seek and ye
shall find.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.899
Please, just one
more, all right?

02:37.999 --> 02:38.859
I told you!

02:38.959 --> 02:41.275
What you want
is no longer in this box.

02:41.375 --> 02:42.567
I need more.

02:42.667 --> 02:43.899
Don't you understand?

02:43.999 --> 02:44.900
I got to have more!

02:45.000 --> 02:46.900
You can never get enough greed,

02:47.000 --> 02:48.334
can you?

02:49.083 --> 02:51.042
PRUE:
Hey!

02:56.792 --> 02:57.834
The box!

02:58.626 --> 02:59.876
Uh...

03:06.999 --> 03:09.651
The box belongs to Lukas!

03:09.751 --> 03:10.692
Yeah, well, tell Lukas

03:10.792 --> 03:12.292
it's been impounded.

03:12.792 --> 03:14.899
Hey, it's okay. It's over.

03:14.999 --> 03:17.899
Oh. I got to have more.

03:17.999 --> 03:18.899
Don't you understand?!

03:18.999 --> 03:21.083
I got to have more!

03:22.999 --> 03:24.292
(<i>horn honking</i>)
No!

04:21.999 --> 04:23.692
This guy just came
out of nowhere?

04:23.792 --> 04:24.899
I have no idea
where he was.

04:24.999 --> 04:27.609
His ID shows him
as a Robert Pike.

04:27.709 --> 04:28.567
Robert Pike?

04:28.667 --> 04:30.025
Yeah.
Okay.

04:30.125 --> 04:30.899
Hey, I-I couldn't stop.

04:30.999 --> 04:33.918
Did you see
any other witnesses?

04:39.501 --> 04:40.401
Hey.

04:40.501 --> 04:41.192
DARRYL:
Hey.

04:41.292 --> 04:42.442
Did you find out
anything?

04:42.542 --> 04:44.109
(<i>sighs</i>):
Nothing unusual.

04:44.209 --> 04:45.526
Unfortunately,
we get these kind

04:45.626 --> 04:47.167
of suicides
all the time.

04:47.501 --> 04:48.899
Darryl, this was not
a suicide, okay?

04:48.999 --> 04:51.526
He was driven into the street,
demonically driven.

04:51.626 --> 04:54.192
I think that I can recognize
the signs by now.

04:54.292 --> 04:55.899
All right.

04:55.999 --> 04:56.983
It's Robert Pike.

04:57.083 --> 04:58.359
He was married
with two kids,

04:58.459 --> 04:59.899
worked for Bregson
Investments

04:59.999 --> 05:01.776
as a stockbroker.

05:01.876 --> 05:02.692
Very successful.

05:02.792 --> 05:04.899
The demon accused him
of being greedy.

05:04.999 --> 05:06.567
I wonder if there's
a connection.

05:06.667 --> 05:07.287
That's hard to believe.

05:07.297 --> 05:10.192
It seems like Mr. Pike
wasn't your typical
stockbroker.

05:10.292 --> 05:12.983
From all accounts,
he was more of a
philanthropist.

05:13.083 --> 05:14.067
He even hosted
a fund-raiser

05:14.167 --> 05:16.734
for the American Cancer
Society just last night.

05:16.834 --> 05:17.899
Something must've changed
in a hurry,

05:17.999 --> 05:22.025
because when we saw him,
all he cared about was the box.

05:22.125 --> 05:23.317
What box?

05:23.417 --> 05:25.501
This one.

05:28.292 --> 05:29.484
What's in it?

05:29.584 --> 05:31.609
I don't know,
but whatever it is,

05:31.709 --> 05:34.125
apparently, it's worth
dying for.

05:35.125 --> 05:36.692
In your opinion,
was there anything

05:36.792 --> 05:39.067
that the bus driver
could've done to avoid him?

05:39.167 --> 05:40.401
Um, no, it happened
too fast.

05:40.501 --> 05:41.899
He didn't have
time to react.

05:41.999 --> 05:44.401
All right.
I think that's it.

05:44.501 --> 05:46.526
If I could just have
your home phone number

05:46.626 --> 05:48.484
in case I have
any other questions...

05:48.584 --> 05:49.859
It's the same
as my sister's.

05:49.959 --> 05:50.899
We live together.

05:50.999 --> 05:52.651
Really?

05:52.751 --> 05:54.899
Just out of curiosity,
what would you say

05:54.999 --> 05:56.899
if one of my
other questions was...

05:56.999 --> 05:59.292
can I take you
out to dinner?

06:02.459 --> 06:04.983
Whoo, you caught me
off guard with that one.

06:05.083 --> 06:06.025
That's my job.

06:06.125 --> 06:07.899
Uh, well, you're-you're
very good at it,

06:07.999 --> 06:12.692
um, but I-I... I think
that it would be best

06:12.792 --> 06:13.859
if those numbers stayed

06:13.959 --> 06:16.083
in your report.

06:16.792 --> 06:18.192
I'm seeing someone.

06:18.292 --> 06:19.818
I'm not surprised.

06:19.918 --> 06:22.192
Officer.

06:22.292 --> 06:24.709
Excuse me.

06:30.999 --> 06:32.317
Are you okay?

06:32.417 --> 06:33.484
Um, I don't know.

06:33.584 --> 06:33.994
I-I keep on thinking

06:34.004 --> 06:36.899
about what we could've done
differently to try and save him,

06:36.999 --> 06:38.899
but he ran into the street
so fast and...

06:38.999 --> 06:40.999
We couldn't have
saved him, Prue.

06:41.999 --> 06:42.899
Not without
knowing more

06:42.999 --> 06:46.042
about the demon
who did this to him.

06:47.667 --> 06:48.999
Lukas.

06:49.417 --> 06:50.567
To find him
we have to find out

06:50.667 --> 06:52.234
what's so special
about this box.

06:52.334 --> 06:54.401
<i>Do you have any idea</i>

06:54.501 --> 06:57.818
how important that box is?!

06:57.918 --> 06:58.818
I thought you
were working

06:58.918 --> 07:00.192
on controlling
your anger.

07:00.292 --> 07:04.334
I am controlling my anger!

07:07.999 --> 07:11.234
At least we got
the businessman's soul, Lukas.

07:11.334 --> 07:12.899
Yes, but I need

07:12.999 --> 07:13.484
to deliver

07:13.584 --> 07:16.067
seven souls for seven sins!

07:16.167 --> 07:18.609
Can't you just
locate the box?

07:18.709 --> 07:21.651
Yes... but I have
to figure out a way

07:21.751 --> 07:24.067
to get around the witches first,

07:24.167 --> 07:25.999
thanks to you.

07:26.751 --> 07:28.776
You know,
my own self-destruction

07:28.876 --> 07:30.818
was supposed
to bring me peace from sin.

07:30.918 --> 07:35.442
Instead, I am damned to spend
eternity inflicting others!

07:35.542 --> 07:38.417
Got to know the product
to move it.

07:38.999 --> 07:41.609
I know the product.

07:41.709 --> 07:43.025
I know how sin

07:43.125 --> 07:45.792
warps human desire.

07:46.918 --> 07:50.734
Which might be exactly the way
to get to the witches.

07:50.834 --> 07:51.776
Yeah.

07:51.876 --> 07:52.567
Sure. Why not?

07:52.667 --> 07:55.025
Witches have human desires,
too, right?

07:55.125 --> 07:58.401
(<i>chuckling</i>)

07:58.501 --> 08:00.025
You know, there's
only one thing

08:00.125 --> 08:02.942
that I can't
quite figure out.

08:03.042 --> 08:05.999
Why do I need you?

08:07.876 --> 08:09.292
No!

08:13.709 --> 08:15.484
Whew.

08:15.584 --> 08:18.334
I needed to vent.

08:24.667 --> 08:25.442
Don't open that.

08:25.542 --> 08:27.401
Let me go get
Piper first.

08:27.501 --> 08:27.899
Why?

08:27.999 --> 08:28.787
Well, gee, Prue,
I don't know.

08:28.797 --> 08:30.651
Maybe so you don't go
running in the street

08:30.751 --> 08:33.918
and get hit
by a bus, too?

08:35.375 --> 08:37.708
Piper, we need...

08:38.542 --> 08:39.317
Wow.

08:39.417 --> 08:40.400
Expecting company?

08:40.501 --> 08:42.734
Uh, no, I was
just making Leo

08:42.833 --> 08:44.526
a little something
to eat, you know,

08:44.626 --> 08:45.401
break up his day.

08:45.501 --> 08:47.692
And something to
take up all of yours?

08:47.792 --> 08:49.109
Well, sushi don't roll
itself.

08:49.209 --> 08:50.942
Besides, I like
taking care of him,

08:51.042 --> 08:53.526
and cooking for him,
and dressing up for him.

08:53.626 --> 08:54.899
I was actually thinking
of going out

08:54.999 --> 08:56.150
and buying him
a whole new wardrobe--

08:56.250 --> 08:57.899
you know, de-flannel him
a little.

08:57.999 --> 09:01.709
What, you're afraid
you're going to lose him?

09:02.999 --> 09:03.454
Wait, are you?

09:03.464 --> 09:04.899
Well, I'm certainly not going
to give the Elders

09:04.999 --> 09:07.983
any excuse to take him away
again, that's for sure.

09:08.083 --> 09:10.025
Oh, Piper,
they wouldn't do that.

09:10.125 --> 09:10.900
You guys are
married now.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.150
So? There is nothing
in those wedding vows

09:13.250 --> 09:15.818
that said they still can't
break us apart.

09:15.918 --> 09:16.983
Besides,
I don't want to be

09:17.083 --> 09:18.526
complacent about my marriage.

09:18.626 --> 09:21.818
Neither he nor They are going
to find any fault in me.

09:21.918 --> 09:24.900
Well, They might
find fault in us.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
Prue and I lost an innocent
this morning.

09:28.918 --> 09:31.959
So we need you.

09:33.083 --> 09:34.899
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!

09:34.999 --> 09:36.484
What are you doing?

09:36.584 --> 09:37.899
Uh, opening the box.

09:37.999 --> 09:39.204
You were supposed to be waiting
for me and Piper.

09:39.214 --> 09:41.899
Okay, so you're here.
I'm going to open it.

09:41.999 --> 09:43.025
Uh!
What if you unleash

09:43.125 --> 09:45.109
some huge abomination?

09:45.209 --> 09:47.025
Whatever it is,
I'm sure that we can handle it.

09:47.125 --> 09:47.899
But at least I think

09:47.999 --> 09:49.109
we should call my husband

09:49.209 --> 09:50.150
and ask his opinion first.

09:50.250 --> 09:52.651
Okay, but we didn't need
his opinion before

09:52.751 --> 09:55.542
when he was just Leo.

09:56.834 --> 09:57.899
You called?

09:57.999 --> 09:58.609
No.

09:58.709 --> 09:59.818
But as long as you're here...

09:59.918 --> 10:01.899
Box intercepted from a demon.

10:01.999 --> 10:03.192
Open it: yea or nay?

10:03.292 --> 10:04.412
Uh, have you checked
<i>The Book of Shadows?</i>

10:04.422 --> 10:07.859
No, but that's a great idea.
Leo, you're a genius.

10:07.959 --> 10:09.109
What would we do without him?

10:09.209 --> 10:10.609
PRUE:
Oh, I don't know,
I guess our lives

10:10.709 --> 10:13.401
wouldn't be the smooth-running,
carefree existence

10:13.501 --> 10:14.192
that they are today.

10:14.292 --> 10:16.899
Oh, uh... Phoebe,
your ethics professor called

10:16.999 --> 10:18.442
about your meeting
today at 2:00?

10:18.542 --> 10:20.734
Well, obviously I
can't make it now.

10:20.834 --> 10:21.776
No, no, no,
you should go.

10:21.876 --> 10:23.818
I mean, you're
too close to graduating

10:23.918 --> 10:25.609
to mess up now.
The three of us

10:25.709 --> 10:26.899
can handle the box.

10:26.999 --> 10:27.899
Are you sure?

10:27.999 --> 10:28.818
Prue:
Yes.

10:28.918 --> 10:30.899
Go! A-although you...

10:30.999 --> 10:31.983
you might want
to change into,

10:32.083 --> 10:36.317
oh, I don't know... clothes.
A-an actual shirt?

10:36.417 --> 10:38.234
Okay.

10:38.334 --> 10:39.651
"Okay."

10:39.751 --> 10:42.501
That's very... Let's go.

10:43.959 --> 10:47.899
"Bottled at the Source,
by the Source."

10:47.999 --> 10:49.234
So, what, it's
a box of sin?

10:49.334 --> 10:50.899
Good thing you
didn't open it.

10:50.999 --> 10:53.109
It would have been
Pandora all over again.

10:53.209 --> 10:56.734
Not quite, but this may be
how the myth got started.

10:56.834 --> 10:59.818
Only it's a much more
specific type of attack.

10:59.918 --> 11:00.537
According to
this, the box

11:00.547 --> 11:05.484
contains seven balls of sin used
to corrupt paragons of good.

11:05.584 --> 11:08.899
If you're a paragon of good,
how do you get corrupted?

11:08.999 --> 11:10.692
Because no one
is immune to sin...

11:10.792 --> 11:11.442
whether it be pride,

11:11.542 --> 11:14.899
envy, gluttony, lust,
anger, greed or sloth,

11:14.999 --> 11:18.484
whichever one you're predisposed
to,<i>is</i> the one that attacks you.

11:18.584 --> 11:19.692
Well, the
businessman must

11:19.792 --> 11:20.579
have been attacked by greed.

11:20.589 --> 11:21.651
That's why he kept on
wanting more.

11:21.751 --> 11:24.651
Only his greed was magnified
a thousand times.

11:24.751 --> 11:25.899
And it explains
why my scrying worked.

11:25.999 --> 11:29.109
I thought the unnatural activity
was a demon courier, but...

11:29.209 --> 11:29.859
it must have been

11:29.959 --> 11:32.983
the sin working against
the businessman's good nature.

11:33.083 --> 11:34.609
Okay, so what do we do now?

11:34.709 --> 11:36.234
Well, the infector appears
to be the link.

11:36.334 --> 11:38.150
Destroy Lukas,
and the sins lose their power.

11:38.250 --> 11:40.734
Do we know anything
about these infectors?

11:40.834 --> 11:41.942
Only that they were humans

11:42.042 --> 11:44.899
consumed by sin
during life and in death.

11:44.999 --> 11:45.899
PIPER:
So what we need

11:45.999 --> 11:47.651
to do now is find
a spell to remove

11:47.751 --> 11:50.192
the sin from the infected
human, in case Lukas

11:50.292 --> 11:51.192
strikes again, right?

11:51.292 --> 11:52.150
You can't
remove sin,

11:52.250 --> 11:53.192
magically
or otherwise.

11:53.292 --> 11:55.834
It's part of all of us.

11:56.751 --> 11:57.999
Even you?

11:58.709 --> 12:02.899
Yes, even me.
Just a tiny, teeny little bit.

12:02.999 --> 12:03.899
Nothing
that anyone

12:03.999 --> 12:06.083
would notice but me.

12:11.375 --> 12:15.292
Okay, you guys! Wish me luck!

12:16.999 --> 12:17.899
Hey.

12:17.999 --> 12:18.859
It's okay.

12:18.959 --> 12:22.292
I think you're
gonna like... this one!

12:26.584 --> 12:27.918
Oh.

12:33.834 --> 12:34.526
What?

12:34.626 --> 12:36.401
What was that?
What just happened?

12:36.501 --> 12:37.526
Oh, no, don't tell me

12:37.626 --> 12:40.484
we got infected with
those sin thingies!

12:40.584 --> 12:41.526
What do you mean?

12:41.626 --> 12:42.401
What is she talking about?

12:42.501 --> 12:45.025
Okay, nobody panic.
Does anybody feel different?

12:45.125 --> 12:46.818
No.
Me neither.

12:46.918 --> 12:47.734
Uh-uh.
All right,

12:47.834 --> 12:50.442
so maybe we're immune
because we're magical.

12:50.542 --> 12:51.359
LEO:
I don't know.

12:51.459 --> 12:52.442
I better orb up and ask.

12:52.542 --> 12:53.776
You do that. Piper and I will

12:53.876 --> 12:54.899
go recheck the book, and <i>you,</i>

12:54.999 --> 12:56.234
missy, you get your butt
to that meeting

12:56.334 --> 12:57.983
and charm the pants off
of your professor.

12:58.083 --> 12:59.818
Go, and get home
as soon as possible.

12:59.918 --> 13:02.334
Ah... no, I'm sure. Go!

13:02.999 --> 13:03.818
PROFESSOR:
<i>The problem is</i>

13:03.918 --> 13:05.734
it's an ethics course;
it's about the dialectic.

13:05.834 --> 13:08.899
So when someone misses
as many classes as you have,

13:08.999 --> 13:10.692
it's hard to catch up.

13:10.792 --> 13:11.734
(<i>sighs</i>)

13:11.834 --> 13:12.899
Are you okay?

13:12.999 --> 13:15.484
I don't know.

13:15.584 --> 13:18.484
Plus you owe me
a major paper.

13:18.584 --> 13:19.899
And if I don't
get it soon...

13:19.999 --> 13:21.942
What are you gonna do to me?

13:22.042 --> 13:24.109
I'll have to give
you an incomplete.

13:24.209 --> 13:25.567
I'll have no
other choice.

13:25.667 --> 13:28.025
Now, do you have anything
to say for yourself?

13:28.125 --> 13:31.317
I'm not wearing any underwear.

13:31.417 --> 13:32.899
Excuse me?

13:32.999 --> 13:37.025
Yeah, I find it too, uh...
constricting.

13:37.125 --> 13:38.692
Are you making
some kind of a joke?

13:38.792 --> 13:43.150
No, I'm serious.
Dead serious.

13:43.250 --> 13:45.317
I've been a bad girl.

13:45.417 --> 13:47.150
A very bad girl.

13:47.250 --> 13:49.150
And I'll do anything
to make it up to you.

13:49.250 --> 13:53.999
I'll do anything to pass.
Anything.

14:00.167 --> 14:01.275
Uh, no, that'll be it.

14:01.375 --> 14:03.734
Just the two Armani suits,
size 42.

14:03.834 --> 14:04.609
The Donna Karan dress...

14:04.709 --> 14:07.150
the three pairs
of Stuart Weitzman shoes,

14:07.250 --> 14:11.025
the one Gucci jacket
and the Prada bag.

14:11.125 --> 14:11.983
What's the total?

14:12.083 --> 14:13.818
All right, we don't
have much time...

14:13.918 --> 14:17.818
Shh! I'm on the phone
with Bloomingdale's.

14:17.918 --> 14:19.776
Oh... okay.

14:19.876 --> 14:21.150
Um... well, then
I'm gonna have

14:21.250 --> 14:23.317
to split that on
two credit cards.

14:23.417 --> 14:23.983
You can put $5,000

14:24.083 --> 14:26.167
on the card that's
on file and...

14:27.626 --> 14:28.275
What are you doing?

14:28.375 --> 14:29.025
Uh, saving your life,

14:29.125 --> 14:32.983
or at least your credit rating,
which is your life.

14:33.083 --> 14:34.776
Excuse me!

14:34.876 --> 14:36.734
Leo needs suits.

14:36.834 --> 14:38.692
Leo doesn't wear suits.

14:38.792 --> 14:40.999
Yet.

14:41.334 --> 14:45.150
Are... are you drinking
in the middle of the day?

14:45.250 --> 14:48.317
I was a little bummed
about this sin thing,

14:48.417 --> 14:50.484
so I thought I deserved
a little indulgence.

14:50.584 --> 14:51.818
Would you like a bit of bubbly?

14:51.918 --> 14:53.359
No, I would like
a little bit of help.

14:53.459 --> 14:55.859
We are supposed to be
tracking down Lukas.

14:55.959 --> 14:57.234
Sorry.
Catch me up.

14:57.334 --> 14:59.859
All right, so it turns out
that those sin balls

14:59.959 --> 15:01.818
work a lot faster
than we thought.

15:01.918 --> 15:02.899
Once infected,
the victim only has

15:02.999 --> 15:06.899
a few hours before it drives him
to total self-destruction.

15:06.999 --> 15:09.067
Well, it's a good thing
we weren't infected then, huh?

15:09.167 --> 15:12.359
Right, but now
that Lukas has the box,

15:12.459 --> 15:13.401
the question is: Who will be?

15:13.501 --> 15:15.567
I mean, I tried scrying
for unnatural activity,

15:15.667 --> 15:18.150
but it just kept on pointing
back to the manor.

15:18.250 --> 15:19.999
Go figure.

15:23.250 --> 15:24.776
Guess what?

15:24.876 --> 15:27.401
My ethics professor
kicked me out of class.

15:27.501 --> 15:28.899
What?
Why, what happened?

15:28.999 --> 15:29.899
I don't know.
I don't know.

15:29.999 --> 15:30.899
One minute I was telling him

15:30.999 --> 15:32.484
why my paper was late,

15:32.584 --> 15:35.651
and the next thing I knew,
I was...

15:35.751 --> 15:39.999
unzipping his pants
with my teeth.

15:41.209 --> 15:41.900
Oh...

15:42.000 --> 15:42.900
Oh, Phoebe, you do know

15:43.000 --> 15:44.899
that charming the pants
off someone

15:44.999 --> 15:46.899
is just a figure of speech,
don't you?

15:46.999 --> 15:49.109
I don't know
what came over me, Prue.

15:49.209 --> 15:51.692
I'm just glad
that I realized
what was happening

15:51.792 --> 15:55.292
before I... Ew!

15:56.167 --> 15:57.651
All right.

15:57.751 --> 16:01.567
Unfortunately, what got
into you was Lust.

16:01.667 --> 16:02.776
As in the sin of.

16:02.876 --> 16:03.317
Wait a minute!

16:03.417 --> 16:05.692
Now you think
we were infected?

16:05.792 --> 16:08.292
Hello, Gluttony,
table for one!

16:09.125 --> 16:10.067
Leo!

16:10.167 --> 16:11.900
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.442
Leo's not up there.

16:13.542 --> 16:14.899
He's in the living room

16:14.999 --> 16:16.292
watching TV.

16:24.792 --> 16:26.942
What are you doing?

16:27.042 --> 16:27.899
Just kickin' back.

16:27.999 --> 16:31.876
Something is wrong
with this picture.

16:32.042 --> 16:34.983
You need chips.
I'll go get some.

16:35.083 --> 16:36.025
Oh, turn on MTV.

16:36.125 --> 16:38.234
I want to see Carson Daly.

16:38.334 --> 16:39.401
He is so hot.

16:39.501 --> 16:41.359
Uh...

16:41.459 --> 16:42.359
Excuse me!

16:42.459 --> 16:43.818
Sins in a box?

16:43.918 --> 16:44.567
Demon hunt, real life?

16:44.667 --> 16:46.484
Can we please focus here?

16:46.584 --> 16:47.899
Now what did They say

16:47.999 --> 16:49.609
about Lukas' sneak attack?

16:49.709 --> 16:50.567
I don't know.

16:50.667 --> 16:51.359
I didn't make it
up there.

16:51.459 --> 16:54.317
I orbed halfway up
and I got tired.

16:54.417 --> 16:54.734
What?

16:54.834 --> 16:55.442
Hey, after 60 years

16:55.542 --> 16:57.859
of constant vigilance,
I think I deserve

16:57.959 --> 16:59.025
a little down time.

16:59.125 --> 17:00.359
Pursuant to orders,

17:00.459 --> 17:02.818
I halted on our side
of the river.

17:02.918 --> 17:04.150
Here you go, honey.

17:04.250 --> 17:05.401
Oh, thanks, sweetie.

17:05.501 --> 17:06.983
I'm gonna be thirsty soon.

17:07.083 --> 17:08.858
Oh, I'm gonna
be ill soon.

17:08.959 --> 17:09.900
(<i>doorbell rings</i>)

17:10.000 --> 17:11.375
I'll get it.

17:14.334 --> 17:16.776
Oh, how gorgeous!

17:16.876 --> 17:17.119
Hi.

17:17.130 --> 17:18.983
Boy, there's
a lot of flowers.

17:19.083 --> 17:19.898
I'll say.

17:19.999 --> 17:22.733
I love a man in a uniform.

17:22.834 --> 17:23.898
Hey, who sent the flowers?

17:23.999 --> 17:25.483
I did... for myself.

17:25.584 --> 17:27.818
Oh, this is just too much.

17:27.917 --> 17:30.667
I bet you're too much.

17:31.292 --> 17:32.859
All right, that's it!

17:32.959 --> 17:33.818
That's enough!

17:33.918 --> 17:35.900
Nothing to see here,
nothing to respond to.

17:36.000 --> 17:36.859
Get out. You!

17:36.959 --> 17:39.292
Whatcha smiling at, buddy?!

17:39.501 --> 17:40.359
Why did you do that?

17:40.459 --> 17:43.899
Because, unless you guys want
those flowers at your funeral,

17:43.999 --> 17:45.776
you had better
get a grip, okay?

17:45.876 --> 17:46.651
You've been infected.

17:46.751 --> 17:49.609
Gluttony, Lust
and that in there...

17:49.709 --> 17:51.359
(<i>burps loudly</i>)

17:51.459 --> 17:52.567
is Sloth.

17:52.667 --> 17:54.317
How did I get gluttony?

17:54.417 --> 17:55.317
I don't overeat.

17:55.417 --> 17:56.192
No, but you overdo.

17:56.292 --> 17:59.234
The sins are drawn
to our predispositions.

17:59.334 --> 18:01.317
And lately, yours
has been excess.

18:01.417 --> 18:02.900
What sin did you get hit with?

18:03.000 --> 18:04.275
Well, I didn't get hit.

18:04.375 --> 18:05.317
Oh, I saw you get hit.

18:05.417 --> 18:07.609
Well, I must be strong enough
to fight it off.

18:07.709 --> 18:09.442
I'm not showing any symptoms,
am I?

18:09.542 --> 18:10.442
And thank
goodness, right?

18:10.542 --> 18:12.983
One of us has to keep
our wits about us.

18:13.083 --> 18:15.192
Hey, turn that up, lazy.

18:15.292 --> 18:19.334
...and now we'll go live
to Bay City Motor Cars.

18:20.999 --> 18:24.818
The SWAT team just arrived
outside Bay City Motor Cars,

18:24.918 --> 18:25.818
a further signal that police

18:25.918 --> 18:28.401
are taking seriously
Pastor Roger Tremble's threat

18:28.501 --> 18:32.275
to shoot and kill his hostage
if his demands are not met.

18:32.375 --> 18:33.609
Do you have any idea

18:33.709 --> 18:36.899
what exactly
the Pastor's demands are?

18:36.999 --> 18:37.579
Well, actually, yeah.

18:37.589 --> 18:40.401
It's a little bizarre,
but he claims he wants a Jag.

18:40.501 --> 18:45.859
Specifically an XKA convertible,
in British racing green.

18:45.959 --> 18:47.067
That's a new one.

18:47.167 --> 18:49.859
That newscaster's
kinda cute.

18:49.959 --> 18:51.317
All right, what do you
want to bet

18:51.417 --> 18:53.150
the demon infected the pastor
with Envy?

18:53.250 --> 18:56.067
Prue, out of all the people
in San Francisco...

18:56.167 --> 18:57.442
Still, he does fit the profile.

18:57.542 --> 19:00.776
Paragon of good, driven to
an act of self destruction.

19:00.876 --> 19:03.899
Yeah, especially
with a SWAT team outside.

19:03.999 --> 19:04.662
All right, we cannot let

19:04.672 --> 19:07.651
this demon steal any more
of our innocents' souls.

19:07.751 --> 19:08.204
Piper, are you coming?

19:08.214 --> 19:12.859
Uh, I was gonna stay here with
Leo and hold down the fort.

19:12.959 --> 19:14.526
More like hold
down the couch.

19:14.626 --> 19:15.359
I'll come if you what me to.

19:15.459 --> 19:19.734
No, it's fine, I'll just do all
of it myself if I have to.

19:19.834 --> 19:21.250
Come on, Phoebe.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.942
Do you think she's mad?

19:24.042 --> 19:26.209
Probably.

Wait.

19:43.250 --> 19:44.567
Coming up after this break,

Make sure you keep 'em back.

20:01.999 --> 20:04.899
Look Darryl,
just let me
handle this.

20:04.999 --> 20:06.899
Look, Prue, it's
a highly charged,

20:06.999 --> 20:07.734
highly public situation.

20:07.834 --> 20:09.899
I can't just ask SWAT
to let you handle it!

20:09.999 --> 20:11.651
I get enough flak
from these guys as it is.

20:11.751 --> 20:14.859
All right, would you rather me
astral-project myself in there?

20:14.959 --> 20:16.275
Come on, Prue, you're not
being reasonable.

20:16.375 --> 20:18.792
I have something to say.

20:18.999 --> 20:20.150
I see that cute officer

20:20.250 --> 20:21.792
from this morning!

20:22.792 --> 20:24.651
Hey, stay on point!

20:24.751 --> 20:25.983
We still have
an innocent to save.

20:26.083 --> 20:27.484
DARRYL:
You're right,
we all do.

20:27.584 --> 20:28.818
Cops included.

20:28.918 --> 20:30.484
Look, just let the hostage
negotiators handle it,

20:30.584 --> 20:31.359
will you please?

20:31.459 --> 20:32.442
Fine. What's their plan?

20:32.542 --> 20:36.442
Their plan is to talk
the pastor down,
wait him out.

20:36.542 --> 20:36.942
Oh, okay.

20:37.042 --> 20:38.567
It works in most cases,
trust me.

20:38.667 --> 20:39.942
Okay, well, if he's
been infected,

20:40.042 --> 20:41.899
it will not work in this case,
trust <i>me,</i>

20:41.999 --> 20:44.275
all right? The pastor's
only gonna get worse.

20:44.375 --> 20:45.609
What would you do to resolve it?

20:45.709 --> 20:47.899
There's only one thing to do.

20:47.999 --> 20:49.109
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, wait!

20:49.209 --> 20:51.709
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

20:53.000 --> 20:55.776
What the hell?!

20:55.876 --> 20:57.526
Her sister...

20:57.626 --> 20:59.584
Phoebe?

21:01.417 --> 21:02.776
They'd better hurry.

21:02.876 --> 21:04.734
I can't wait much longer!

21:04.834 --> 21:05.818
Pastor Tremble...

21:05.918 --> 21:07.918
Who are you?

21:10.459 --> 21:11.234
Okay, hold on.

21:11.334 --> 21:12.150
I'm, I'm here to help.

21:12.250 --> 21:14.776
But I cannot do that
unless you put the gun down.

21:14.876 --> 21:15.899
Get out of here!

21:15.999 --> 21:17.442
I just want to talk.

21:17.542 --> 21:19.025
I just want my Jag.

21:19.125 --> 21:20.526
Do you want me

21:20.626 --> 21:21.999
to shoot you, too?

21:22.292 --> 21:23.192
I swear I will!

21:23.292 --> 21:23.899
Okay, no, no, no, wait.

21:23.999 --> 21:26.150
I... I know
what's happened to you, okay?

21:26.250 --> 21:27.899
You've been infected with sin.

21:27.999 --> 21:29.150
I warned you!

21:29.250 --> 21:30.250
No... ooh.

(<i>crowd shrieks</i>)

21:37.999 --> 21:40.859
Prue, you all right?

21:40.959 --> 21:43.834
Talk to me, Prue.

21:58.626 --> 22:02.109
All right, everybody,
everything's under control.

22:02.209 --> 22:03.067
Don't worry about a thing.

22:03.167 --> 22:04.776
I got it all under control.

22:04.876 --> 22:05.859
Hi. He needs
medical attention.

22:05.959 --> 22:07.567
The pastor's inside.
I kicked his ass.

22:07.667 --> 22:08.651
He needs attention, too.

22:08.751 --> 22:10.542
He's knocked out.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.899
Hi. If I could just
ask a few questions?

22:14.999 --> 22:16.567
The name's Halliwell,
Prue Halliwell.

22:16.667 --> 22:17.329
What made you run
in there?

22:17.339 --> 22:18.899
Well, it is my job
to protect the innocents.

22:18.999 --> 22:20.818
Do you work
for the police?
No, actually, I don't...

22:20.918 --> 22:23.651
No, she's a good Samaritan,
a very good Samaritan.

22:23.751 --> 22:25.125
No further questions.

22:25.876 --> 22:26.609
Why did you do that?

22:26.709 --> 22:27.204
I was just getting started.

22:27.214 --> 22:28.651
Because you were
about to hang yourself.

22:28.751 --> 22:30.567
You shouldn't be talking
to the press.

22:30.667 --> 22:30.983
Why not?

22:31.083 --> 22:32.025
Because they'll destroy you.

22:32.125 --> 22:32.983
What's the matter with you?

22:33.083 --> 22:37.250
Nothing can destroy me, Darryl.

22:38.501 --> 22:39.651
Prue, are you bleeding?

22:39.751 --> 22:41.275
Whoo! I am. Oh, my.

22:41.375 --> 22:45.317
Wow, that bullet
must have grazed me.

22:45.417 --> 22:46.275
And you didn't even feel it?

22:46.375 --> 22:47.899
No, no, you know,
the adrenaline.

22:47.999 --> 22:49.025
It's no big deal.

22:49.125 --> 22:49.859
No big deal?

22:49.959 --> 22:51.776
You almost got
yourself killed!

22:51.876 --> 22:53.734
I've never seen you
run away from danger before,

22:53.834 --> 22:55.609
but I've never seen you
run toward it either.

22:55.709 --> 22:57.150
What have you got,
a death wish or something?

22:57.250 --> 23:01.359
It does sound kind
of self-destructive, doesn't it?

23:01.459 --> 23:02.150
Oh.

23:02.250 --> 23:04.401
Oh, that means
I've been infected.

23:04.501 --> 23:05.359
That must be why

23:05.459 --> 23:07.067
I can't control my powers.

23:07.167 --> 23:07.899
Prue, what's going on?

23:07.999 --> 23:09.317
Darryl, I don't
have time to explain.

23:09.417 --> 23:11.109
Can you get Pastor Tremble
to a safe place?

23:11.209 --> 23:12.942
Some place where he
won't hurt himself,

23:13.042 --> 23:13.899
like a psychiatric
hospital?

23:13.999 --> 23:16.067
Yeah, sure, it shouldn't
be a problem, I guess.

23:16.167 --> 23:19.442
Okay, good,
but nobody can know
that he's there, okay?

23:19.542 --> 23:19.995
Because if so,

23:20.005 --> 23:21.359
the demon will find him
and kill him.

23:21.459 --> 23:23.692
Okay, I don't know how long
I can keep it a secret though.

23:23.792 --> 23:24.818
Well, I don't really
need that long.

23:24.918 --> 23:26.150
Just long enough for me
to find the demon

23:26.250 --> 23:26.899
and vanquish him, okay?

23:26.999 --> 23:31.542
Okay, now where
is my sister? Phoebe?!

23:45.709 --> 23:48.042

I came prepared.

Are you out of your mind?!

24:06.542 --> 24:07.900
Um... yeah, I think so.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.899
But if you're
gonna go crazy...

24:09.999 --> 24:13.609
Yeah, well my sin's not nearly
as much fun as yours.

24:13.709 --> 24:14.401
Wait. Your sin?

24:14.501 --> 24:16.567
I thought
you didn't get hit.

24:16.667 --> 24:17.899
Well, that was
the Pride talking.

24:17.999 --> 24:20.150
And it almost got me
killed already!

You don't seem
all that different.

24:22.584 --> 24:23.245
Oh, really?
Well, back at ya!

24:23.255 --> 24:26.983
We need to get home
and try and track down
this demon, okay?

24:27.083 --> 24:27.692
No, I don't think so.

24:27.792 --> 24:30.899
I'm having too much fun,
so... I'll just see you later.

24:30.999 --> 24:34.651
If I don't get you home,
there won't be a later!

What the hell
is the matter with you?

24:36.999 --> 24:38.567
Not only in the middle
of the day...

24:38.667 --> 24:39.899
but in the middle
of a crisis!

24:39.999 --> 24:42.484
Look, she attacked me.
I swear.

24:42.584 --> 24:44.359
I didn't have a choice!

24:44.459 --> 24:45.899
Well, not much of one.

24:45.999 --> 24:47.317
That's a pathetic excuse.

to do? Shoot her?

24:58.542 --> 25:01.442
You can't suspend me!

25:01.542 --> 25:03.899
It was her fault.

25:03.999 --> 25:04.567
Damn it!

Yes, he did, but Envy is only
the sixth sin,

27:38.959 --> 27:39.526
Leo!

27:39.626 --> 27:40.899
You get up there right now.

27:40.999 --> 27:42.317
You are a whitelighter.

27:42.417 --> 27:42.899
That's your job!

27:42.999 --> 27:46.484
Why? You never
listen to me anyway.

27:46.584 --> 27:48.859
LEO:
I think I'm gonna
orb upstairs

27:48.959 --> 27:49.899
and take a nap.

27:49.999 --> 27:51.834
(<i>yawns</i>)

27:53.417 --> 27:54.359
PRUE:
Fine.

27:54.459 --> 27:55.317
Fine, fine, orb.

27:55.417 --> 27:56.401
Who needs you anyway?

27:56.501 --> 27:59.125
We still have
the Power of Three.

28:22.459 --> 28:25.609
Did you find out
where they're hiding the pastor?

28:25.709 --> 28:26.651
Where'd you come from?

28:26.751 --> 28:27.899
Answer my question.

28:27.999 --> 28:28.942
No one's talking,

28:29.042 --> 28:30.192
at least not to me.

28:30.292 --> 28:31.150
That's not good enough.

28:31.250 --> 28:33.651
Look, I don't know
who you think you are!

28:33.751 --> 28:36.792
(<i>grunting</i>)

28:37.125 --> 28:39.234
Anger's the worst, isn't it?

28:39.334 --> 28:40.899
Especially when
the burning rage

28:40.999 --> 28:43.067
saps you of all
your strength and reason,

28:43.167 --> 28:46.484
and the relentless scream
blots out all hope.

28:46.584 --> 28:48.792
Use it against the Halliwells.

28:48.999 --> 28:53.626
Make them tell you
where the pastor is.

28:56.000 --> 28:56.899
Trust me.

28:56.999 --> 29:01.375
Anger always feels better
when it has a target.

29:06.375 --> 29:08.067
PRUE:
<i>There is nothing.</i>

29:08.167 --> 29:09.401
There is nothing in <i>The Book.</i>

29:09.501 --> 29:10.942
Why did only
lame witches precede us?

29:11.042 --> 29:13.818
Because nobody is
as good as you, Prue.

29:13.918 --> 29:16.150
You know, at least
I am trying, Piper.

29:16.250 --> 29:17.899
Instead of getting
a foot massage

29:17.999 --> 29:20.192
or instead of sleeping.

29:20.292 --> 29:21.609
I'm not sleeping.

29:21.709 --> 29:24.899
I'm just having the best
premonitions of my life.

29:24.999 --> 29:25.329
Of what?

29:25.339 --> 29:28.983
It's a button off
Officer Cutie's shirt.

29:29.083 --> 29:29.818
And let me tell you,

29:29.918 --> 29:32.025
if the movie's anything
like the previews...

29:32.125 --> 29:33.818
Whoa.

29:33.918 --> 29:37.542
All right, is that
all that you care about?

29:38.000 --> 29:39.317
Fine.

29:39.417 --> 29:40.651
I'll save the innocents,

29:40.751 --> 29:41.899
I'll vanquish the demon,

29:41.999 --> 29:43.109
and if I feel like it,

29:43.209 --> 29:44.526
maybe when I'm done,

29:44.626 --> 29:45.442
I'll save you guys.

29:45.542 --> 29:46.818
Oh, don't do us any favors.

29:46.918 --> 29:49.375
Yeah, Prue,
worry about yourself.

29:50.417 --> 29:51.899
(<i>screams</i>)

29:51.999 --> 29:52.918
Piper!

29:54.334 --> 29:56.275
You all right?

29:56.375 --> 29:58.859
Oh, what happened?
Uh, you were shocked.

29:58.959 --> 30:00.192
I feel strange.

30:00.292 --> 30:01.526
PRUE:
Yes, well,
if you had

30:01.626 --> 30:02.776
had both feet
in the water,

30:02.876 --> 30:04.192
you wouldn't feel
anything... Oh!

30:04.292 --> 30:07.067
(<i>both grunt</i>)
(<i>doorbell rings</i>)

30:07.167 --> 30:08.751
Who's that?

30:10.542 --> 30:11.025
Oh!

30:11.125 --> 30:14.442
Oh! It's Officer Cutie
from this morning.

30:14.542 --> 30:14.899
Hey!

30:14.999 --> 30:15.899
Hey, up here.

30:15.999 --> 30:18.442
Hey, I'm gonna
come down, okay?
Phoebe, watch out.

30:18.542 --> 30:19.401
Whoo!

30:19.501 --> 30:20.899
Oh!
Oh!

30:20.999 --> 30:22.025
PRUE:
For the love of sin,
do you

30:22.125 --> 30:25.899
see what's
happening?
Oh, that was close.

30:25.999 --> 30:27.125
Oh.

30:28.083 --> 30:31.942
Prue, we just have different
priorities than you do.

30:32.042 --> 30:33.359
You need a
little pick-me-up.

30:33.459 --> 30:36.792
How about I buy you some shoes?

30:38.999 --> 30:40.609
I knew you'd come back for me.

30:40.709 --> 30:44.818
This isn't a social call.

30:44.918 --> 30:45.609
Whoo!

30:45.709 --> 30:46.526
(<i>laughs</i>)

30:46.626 --> 30:47.526
Are we role playing?

30:47.626 --> 30:49.442
Did you bring
your handcuffs?

30:49.542 --> 30:51.651
Where's the pastor?

30:51.751 --> 30:53.818
I don't know, I swear.

30:53.918 --> 30:54.859
You're lying!

30:57.417 --> 31:00.417
You're something else,
you know that?

31:01.501 --> 31:04.459
I got suspended because of you!

31:04.999 --> 31:06.734
You think you can ruin
somebody's life

31:06.834 --> 31:08.651
and not pay for it?!

31:08.751 --> 31:10.234
Well, you're gonna pay.

31:10.334 --> 31:11.275
No.
You're gonna pay

31:11.375 --> 31:12.109
right now.

Please, don't shoot.

Piper.

33:27.125 --> 33:29.000

You glowed.

Doesn't matter.

33:32.209 --> 33:33.567
Where are you hurt?
No.

33:33.667 --> 33:35.899
You got to go downstairs
and heal Phoebe first

33:35.999 --> 33:40.192
and then go find Prue
because the demon took her.

33:40.292 --> 33:41.899
You glowed, too.

33:41.999 --> 33:44.192
I did?

33:44.292 --> 33:45.859
Did you heal me?

No, not yet.

33:48.999 --> 33:50.899
(<i>panting</i>)

33:50.999 --> 33:52.899
It's the sins.

33:52.999 --> 33:53.899
We-we must've

33:53.999 --> 33:54.899
gotten rid of 'em.

33:54.999 --> 33:55.454
Wait a minute.

33:55.464 --> 33:58.025
You said there was no
magical way to do that.

33:58.125 --> 33:58.899
There isn't.

33:58.999 --> 34:00.899
Maybe there's a human way.

34:00.999 --> 34:02.275
Maybe by...

34:02.375 --> 34:03.818
being selfless,

34:03.918 --> 34:05.899
by you caring more
about your sisters

34:05.999 --> 34:07.859
and me caring more about you,

34:07.959 --> 34:09.583
we overcame it.

34:09.998 --> 34:10.899
Well, that means Phoebe

34:10.998 --> 34:12.859
must have gotten rid
of her sin, too,

34:12.958 --> 34:15.150
because she risked
her life to save me.

What are you doing up?

Fixing you.

34:36.667 --> 34:37.899
Where's Prue?

34:37.998 --> 34:39.692
Uh, we don't know,
but we need to find her.

34:39.792 --> 34:42.751
She won't admit it,
but she's in big trouble.

34:48.042 --> 34:51.899
You think you can break free,
but you can't.

34:51.998 --> 34:55.317
See, that's what makes pride
the deadliest of all the sins.

34:55.417 --> 34:58.317
It makes you think
that you're invincible,

34:58.417 --> 34:59.275
above it all.

34:59.375 --> 34:59.900
My powers are...

35:00.000 --> 35:01.734
Useless now.

35:01.834 --> 35:02.899
Corrupted.

35:02.999 --> 35:03.983
You have only a small

35:04.083 --> 35:04.942
window of opportunity

35:05.042 --> 35:07.899
to save your life
before it's too late.

35:07.999 --> 35:09.275
No demon has defeated me,

35:09.375 --> 35:10.900
and you won't be the first.

35:11.000 --> 35:14.900
You see, but I don't
have to defeat you.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.109
You're gonna
defeat yourself.

35:17.209 --> 35:18.025
In mere minutes,

35:18.125 --> 35:20.899
you'll be so far gone,
you will self-destruct

35:20.999 --> 35:22.359
just like all the rest.

35:22.459 --> 35:25.192
However, I am willing
to make you a deal.

35:25.292 --> 35:26.899
I don't make deals with demons.

35:26.999 --> 35:28.899
Do you listen to them?

35:28.999 --> 35:29.609
Hmm?

35:29.709 --> 35:32.275
Look, we both know that
you safeguarded the pastor,

35:32.375 --> 35:35.442
which means that I
can't deliver his soul.

35:35.542 --> 35:38.983
But this late in the game,
I am willing to pay for it.

35:39.083 --> 35:40.609
Tell me where
the pastor is,

35:40.709 --> 35:42.484
and I'll remove your sin.

35:42.584 --> 35:43.025
Go to hell.

35:43.125 --> 35:44.025
This is my hell,

35:44.125 --> 35:45.317
every rotten day of it.

35:45.417 --> 35:47.150
Listen, I am giving you

35:47.250 --> 35:50.192
a chance to save
your life, Prue,

35:50.292 --> 35:52.025
to end <i>your</i> hell.

35:52.125 --> 35:53.234
If you remove my sin,

35:53.334 --> 35:55.983
you'll still be one soul short.

35:56.083 --> 35:57.899
That's true.

35:57.999 --> 36:00.484
But... once expunged,

36:00.584 --> 36:02.651
I can use the sin again.

36:02.751 --> 36:03.275
(<i>grunts</i>)

36:03.375 --> 36:07.609
You see, it'll just...
pop right back into my box.

36:07.709 --> 36:09.818
And let you infect
another innocent?

36:09.918 --> 36:11.109
I don't think so.

Pride goeth before

36:23.999 --> 36:24.983
a very long fall, Prue,

36:25.083 --> 36:26.067
so what's your decision?

36:26.167 --> 36:28.834
Remember, if I lose, you lose.

36:29.542 --> 36:31.109
All right.

36:31.209 --> 36:31.900
All right, untie me.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.942
Tell me where
the pastor is first.

36:34.042 --> 36:35.734
Oh, untie me first.

36:35.834 --> 36:37.275
If I self-destruct,

36:37.375 --> 36:39.417
you'll never get his soul.

36:43.999 --> 36:45.692
All right, now, where is he?

36:45.792 --> 36:46.899
Ha.

36:46.999 --> 36:48.542
You lose, I win! Ha!

No!

36:56.501 --> 36:57.776
Why did she have
to have pride?

Pride is the one sin
you can't beat.

I was saving you!

Saving me?

37:23.339 --> 37:25.942
I had it under control,
and I didn't need your help.

37:26.042 --> 37:27.317
Right.

37:27.417 --> 37:28.317
Uh-oh.

It looks like the only way

No!

37:47.209 --> 37:49.734
No! No!

37:49.834 --> 37:50.983
Oh!

37:51.083 --> 37:52.899
PRUE:
Okay, whoa.

37:52.999 --> 37:54.776
What just happened?

37:54.876 --> 37:55.359
(<i>sighs</i>)

37:55.459 --> 37:56.900
I think you just
lost your pride.

37:57.000 --> 38:00.317
And these must be
envy and anger.

38:00.417 --> 38:02.109
Which must mean
the pastor and cop

38:02.209 --> 38:03.792
are okay now.

38:06.042 --> 38:09.042
Oh, oh.

38:10.999 --> 38:12.667
Okay.

38:13.501 --> 38:14.567
Oh.

38:14.667 --> 38:16.692
Wait a minute.
Is this another?

38:16.792 --> 38:18.709
I don't think so.

38:18.999 --> 38:21.692
Maybe it's the
businessman's soul?

38:21.792 --> 38:22.192
PIPER:
Oh.

38:22.292 --> 38:26.375
Well, then you should
release it someplace nice.

38:26.959 --> 38:28.999
I know the perfect place.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.734
PRUE:
Wow, we sure

38:33.834 --> 38:34.983
showed that demon.

38:35.083 --> 38:36.275
(<i>chuckles</i>)

38:36.375 --> 38:39.567
Okay, you guys
sure showed that demon.

38:39.667 --> 38:39.994
Thank you.

38:40.004 --> 38:43.067
So I guess I needed you guys
a lot more than you needed me.

38:43.167 --> 38:44.859
No, we all needed
each other.

38:44.959 --> 38:46.692
You got me back
to the house,

38:46.792 --> 38:47.651
you saved the innocents...

38:47.751 --> 38:48.899
Yeah, but...
PIPER:
Oh, stop it.

38:48.999 --> 38:49.942
I don't like this humble Prue.

38:50.042 --> 38:52.484
I want my real sister back.
Me, too.

38:52.584 --> 38:53.983
Well, I-I mean,
I did save that cop

38:54.083 --> 38:54.899
from killing himself,

38:54.999 --> 38:55.899
and I was smart enough
to tell...

38:55.999 --> 38:58.899
She's back.
...Darryl to hide
the pastor away,

38:58.999 --> 39:00.167
and, um...

39:00.999 --> 39:03.567

39:03.667 --> 39:05.209

39:44.083 --> 39:44.900
Ooh.

39:45.000 --> 39:45.609
Here you go.

39:45.709 --> 39:48.317
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm abstaining.

39:48.417 --> 39:49.899
Piper, it's okay to indulge.

39:49.999 --> 39:51.109
Just don't overindulge.

39:51.209 --> 39:51.704
I guess we can

39:51.714 --> 39:55.150
thank Lukas for teaching us
anything in moderation.

39:55.250 --> 39:55.899
Hey, there was

39:55.999 --> 39:57.859
nothing that Lukas
could teach me.

39:57.959 --> 40:00.042
Oh, really?

40:01.501 --> 40:02.983
I'm doing it again, aren't I?

40:03.083 --> 40:03.859
That whole pride thing.

40:03.959 --> 40:06.734
I swear,
I'm working on it.
It's a constant struggle.

40:06.834 --> 40:08.859
Here's one thing
that I'm willing to admit

40:08.959 --> 40:09.567
I don't understand.

40:09.667 --> 40:10.899
You, Phoebe, and Leo
were all able

40:10.999 --> 40:13.359
to get rid of your sins
with a selfless act.

40:13.459 --> 40:16.359
I committed
many selfless acts, yet...

40:16.459 --> 40:18.983
why did I have to wait
for Lukas to be vanquished

40:19.083 --> 40:20.317
to get rid of my pride?

40:20.417 --> 40:20.942
Well, Lukas said

40:21.042 --> 40:24.651
that pride was the
one sin you can't beat.

40:24.751 --> 40:25.567
I think what he meant was

40:25.667 --> 40:28.899
that there's no such thing
as a selfless act to pride.

40:28.999 --> 40:32.899
I threw myself into the pit
for the pastor.

40:32.999 --> 40:35.109
Yeah, but you
did that to win,

40:35.209 --> 40:36.192
so any good you did

40:36.292 --> 40:37.899
during your prideful state

40:37.999 --> 40:40.609
was for the greater
glory of Prue.

40:40.709 --> 40:41.526
All right, fine.

40:41.626 --> 40:42.526
Then here's to Leo...

40:42.626 --> 40:44.651
for saving me
from eternal torment.

40:44.751 --> 40:45.776
Mm-hmm.

40:45.876 --> 40:47.609
And to me for
not trying to be

40:47.709 --> 40:48.567
the perfect couple.

40:48.667 --> 40:50.150
If it isn't good
enough for them,

40:50.250 --> 40:51.150
then screw 'em.

40:51.250 --> 40:53.899
I'll drink to that.

40:53.999 --> 40:55.359
PHOEBE:
Excuse me.

40:55.459 --> 40:56.484
Oh!

40:56.584 --> 40:57.609
Hi. I'm so excited.

40:57.709 --> 41:00.067
And not in any sexual
kind of way.

41:00.167 --> 41:01.484
Uh, recent events

41:01.584 --> 41:03.442
inspired me to write a paper

41:03.542 --> 41:04.162
on sexual politics,

41:04.172 --> 41:07.067
claiming that my indiscretion
with Professor Kass

41:07.167 --> 41:09.109
was an ethical experiment.

41:09.209 --> 41:11.317
So I hand the paper in
yesterday,

41:11.417 --> 41:15.417
and...
pause for dramatic effect.

41:16.999 --> 41:17.983
So, did he buy it?

41:18.083 --> 41:19.526
I got a B.

41:19.626 --> 41:19.995
Yay!

41:20.005 --> 41:22.109
Minus, but I got it
fair and square,

41:22.209 --> 41:23.359
which means
I will be able

41:23.459 --> 41:27.109
to graduate, and no man,
not even Cole,

41:27.209 --> 41:28.899
is gonna stand in my way.

41:28.999 --> 41:29.942
Congratulations.

41:30.042 --> 41:31.526
I am very proud of you.

41:31.626 --> 41:32.899
Oh, and coming from you...

41:32.999 --> 41:34.192
Hey, be nice.

41:34.292 --> 41:35.692
I don't even
want to think

41:35.792 --> 41:36.776
about sin tonight.

41:36.876 --> 41:37.442
Me, neither.

41:37.542 --> 41:40.275
So, this is
a pretty interesting band.

41:40.375 --> 41:41.526
What's their name?

41:41.626 --> 41:43.025
Orgy.
