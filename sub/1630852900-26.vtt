WEBVTT

00:32.365 --> 00:32.899
WELCOME TO LAST WEEK

00:32.966 --> 00:33.366
TONIGHT.

00:33.433 --> 00:34.067
I'M JOHN OLIVER, THANKS SO MUCH

00:34.134 --> 00:35.135
FOR JOINING US.

00:35.201 --> 00:36.936
IT'S BEEN A BUSY WEEK.

00:37.003 --> 00:38.605
THE JANUARY 6TH PANEL VOTED TO

00:38.671 --> 00:40.106
SUBPOENA DONALD TRUMP, ALEX

00:40.173 --> 00:41.408
JONES CONTINUED HIS LOSING

00:41.474 --> 00:43.376
RECORD IN THE LEGAL INFO WARS,

00:43.443 --> 00:44.477
AND A VIRTUAL MARK ZUCKERBERG

00:44.544 --> 00:45.945
ANNOUNCED THAT "LEGS ARE COMING

00:46.012 --> 00:46.646
SOON!

00:46.713 --> 00:48.515
ARE YOU EXCITED?"

00:48.581 --> 00:49.983
WHICH SOUNDS LESS LIKE AN UPDATE

00:50.049 --> 00:50.950
TO A MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR

00:51.017 --> 00:51.718
METAVERSE AND MORE LIKE A NEW

00:51.785 --> 00:54.354
SECTION ON WIKIFEET.

00:54.421 --> 00:56.022
BUT WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN WITH

00:56.089 --> 00:57.223
THE WAR IN UKRAINE, WHICH HAS

00:57.290 --> 00:58.858
SEEN A SIGNIFICANT ESCALATION.

00:58.925 --> 01:00.226
RUSSIA'S PUNISHING MISSILE

01:00.293 --> 01:02.729
BARRAGE THIS WEEK CAPTURED ON

01:02.796 --> 01:04.497
DASH CAMS AND OTHER CAMERAS

01:04.564 --> 01:06.399
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

01:06.466 --> 01:09.436
THE BRUTAL RETALIATION FOR THE

01:09.502 --> 01:11.771
BLAST ON THE BRIDGE CONNECTING

01:11.838 --> 01:13.373
RUSSIA TO CRIMEA DIRECTED BY

01:13.440 --> 01:14.207
HARD-LINE COMMANDER SERGEI

01:14.274 --> 01:15.809
SUROVIKIN.

01:15.875 --> 01:17.310
IT'S TRUE: SUROVIKIN'S

01:17.377 --> 01:18.611
APPOINTMENT WAS ANNOUNCED JUST

01:18.678 --> 01:19.712
HOURS AFTER THE BRIDGE

01:19.779 --> 01:20.980
EXPLOSION, WHICH SENDS A REAL

01:21.047 --> 01:21.915
MESSAGE.

01:21.981 --> 01:23.349
BECAUSE HE'S NOT ONLY KNOWN FOR

01:23.416 --> 01:25.118
HIS BRUTAL TACTICS IN SYRIA,

01:25.185 --> 01:25.752
HE'S BEEN NICKNAMED "GENERAL

01:25.819 --> 01:27.487
ARMAGEDDON."

01:27.554 --> 01:29.088
AND NO ONE BRINGS IN A GUY NAMED

01:29.155 --> 01:31.124
"GENERAL ARMAGEDDON' TO DO

01:31.191 --> 01:32.692
"FEWER" WAR CRIMES.

01:32.759 --> 01:34.060
LOOK AT HIM!

01:34.127 --> 01:35.128
HE'S SOMEHOW TERRIFYING, WHILE

01:35.195 --> 01:36.329
ALSO LOOKING LIKE AN ANGRY BABY

01:36.396 --> 01:38.832
FORCED INTO A FUN OUTFIT.

01:38.898 --> 01:40.433
NOW, THE SCALE OF THE

01:40.500 --> 01:46.339
RETALIATION THIS WEEK MAY SEEM

01:46.406 --> 01:46.906
EXTREME, BUT

01:46.973 --> 01:47.507
THAT BRIDGE WAS A BIG DEAL TO

01:47.574 --> 01:48.408
PUTIN.

01:48.475 --> 01:49.242
RUSSIA BEGAN BUILDING IT RIGHT

01:49.309 --> 01:50.109
AFTER ANNEXING CRIMEA IN 2014,

01:50.176 --> 01:51.010
AND PUTIN CELEBRATED ITS OPENING

01:51.077 --> 01:52.078
BY PROUDLY DRIVING ACROSS IT

01:52.145 --> 01:53.413
HIMSELF.

01:53.480 --> 01:55.515
THE RUSSIAN STATE EVEN FUNDED A

01:55.582 --> 01:57.450
ROM-COM SET DURING THE BRIDGE'S

01:57.517 --> 01:58.785
CONSTRUCTION, CALLED "THE

01:58.852 --> 02:01.020
MADE WITH LOVE!"

02:01.087 --> 02:02.121
IT'S BASICALLY A BRIDGE-BASED

02:02.188 --> 02:06.292
"LOVE ACTUALLY."

02:06.359 --> 02:09.262
JUST TO TAKE A QUICK LOOK AT THE

02:09.329 --> 02:09.496
TRAILER.

02:25.378 --> 02:26.713
WELCOME TO THE KRYMSKIY

02:26.779 --> 02:27.413
BRIDGE, THE BIGGEST BRIDGE IN

02:27.480 --> 02:29.315
RUSSIA!

02:29.382 --> 02:30.483
LISTEN TO ME: THIS

02:30.550 --> 02:31.951
MOVIE IS ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT.

02:32.018 --> 02:33.152
DID I WATCH ALL 100 MINUTES OF

02:33.219 --> 02:33.887
IT ON YOUTUBE?

02:33.953 --> 02:35.054
YES.

02:35.121 --> 02:35.922
AM I GOING TO TELL YOU ALL ABOUT

02:35.989 --> 02:37.390
IT?

02:37.457 --> 02:38.892
I AM.

02:38.958 --> 02:40.059
BASICALLY, A BUNCH OF CHARACTERS

02:40.126 --> 02:41.261
MEET AND FALL IN LOVE SOMEWHERE

02:41.327 --> 02:41.861
NEAR THE CONSTRUCTION SITE OF

02:41.928 --> 02:43.329
THE CRIMEAN BRIDGE.

02:43.396 --> 02:44.364
THIS IS VARYA, A YOUNG

02:44.430 --> 02:45.365
ARCHAEOLOGIST WHO IS DOING

02:45.431 --> 02:46.432
ARCHEOLOGY AT THE BEACH ALL THE

02:46.499 --> 02:48.401
TIME.

02:48.468 --> 02:49.402
SHE'S ROMANTICALLY PURSUED BY

02:49.469 --> 02:50.637
VIKTOR, THE SLICK P-R MAN, AND

02:50.703 --> 02:51.971
DIMA, THE YOUNG, BEEFY

02:52.038 --> 02:54.073
CONSTRUCTION WORKER.

02:54.140 --> 02:55.375
DURING THE MOVIE, DIMA IS, A,

02:55.441 --> 02:56.409
ACCUSED OF ARSON NEAR THE

02:56.476 --> 02:57.544
CRIMEAN BRIDGE, B, SAVES A

02:57.610 --> 02:58.678
FELLOW CONSTRUCTION WORKER WHO

02:58.745 --> 03:00.179
FALLS OFF THE CRIMEAN BRIDGE,

03:00.246 --> 03:01.681
AND C, TAKES CONTROL OF A

03:01.748 --> 03:02.815
CRASHING PLANE AND LANDS IT

03:02.882 --> 03:03.816
SAFELY ON-- YOU GUESSED IT-- THE

03:03.883 --> 03:08.388
CRIMEAN BRIDGE.

03:08.454 --> 03:09.055
MEANWHILE, A

03:09.122 --> 03:09.822
JOURNALIST NAMED TIKHON ARRIVES

03:09.889 --> 03:10.757
TO WRITE AN ARTICLE ABOUT THE

03:10.823 --> 03:11.424
BRIDGE'S HISTORY, AND FALLS IN

03:11.491 --> 03:12.458
LOVE WITH ALYA, WHO'S THE

03:12.525 --> 03:14.093
CLASSIC ROMCOM ARCHETYPE OF

03:14.160 --> 03:15.995
"BEAUTIFUL, SHY FISHMONGER."

03:16.062 --> 03:17.697
ALYA, WE LEARN, WAS ACTUALLY

03:17.764 --> 03:18.798
ORPHANED WHEN HER DAD DOZED OFF

03:18.865 --> 03:20.300
BEHIND THE WHEEL AFTER SPENDING

03:20.366 --> 03:21.401
HOURS IN TRAFFIC THAT WOULDN'T

03:21.467 --> 03:24.337
HAVE EXISTED IF THERE HAD ONLY

03:24.404 --> 03:25.338
BEEN A-- SAY IT WITH ME--

03:25.405 --> 03:27.607
CRIMEAN BRIDGE.

03:27.674 --> 03:28.441
THE MOVIE ENDS WITH THE NEW

03:28.508 --> 03:29.742
BRIDGE COMPLETED, THE CHARACTERS

03:29.809 --> 03:30.743
PAIRING OFF, AND EVERYONE

03:30.810 --> 03:33.079
MARCHING ACROSS IT INTO

03:33.146 --> 03:34.113
ILLEGALLY ANNEXED TERRITORY.

03:34.180 --> 03:36.115
THIS MOVIE IS MY WHOLE BRAIN

03:36.182 --> 03:37.183
NOW.

03:37.250 --> 03:37.951
DO NOT WATCH IT OR IT WILL TAKE

03:38.017 --> 03:40.086
OVER YOUR LIFE.

03:40.153 --> 03:41.187
THE POINT IS, PUTIN'S CLEARLY

03:41.254 --> 03:42.288
VERY ANGRY HIS BRIDGE GOT BLOWN

03:42.355 --> 03:43.323
UP.

03:43.389 --> 03:44.090
BUT HIS WAR EFFORT IS NOTABLY

03:44.157 --> 03:45.258
STRUGGLING.

03:45.325 --> 03:46.059
THERE'VE BEEN REPORTS OF

03:46.125 --> 03:47.060
THOUSANDS OF RUSSIAN MEN LEAVING

03:47.126 --> 03:49.429
THE COUNTRY TO ESCAPE THE DRAFT,

03:49.495 --> 03:50.663
AND STORIES LIKE THIS ONE, ABOUT

03:50.730 --> 03:52.231
A MAN SHELTERING IN GEORGIA.

03:52.298 --> 03:53.499
ALEKSEI TAKES US TO

03:53.566 --> 03:54.734
THESHELTER HE NOW CALLS HOME

03:54.801 --> 03:56.235
AFTERDRIVING SEVEN DAYS FROM

03:56.302 --> 04:02.375
MOSCOW, WITH LITTLE MORE THAN

04:02.442 --> 04:04.611
HIS GUITAR.

04:04.677 --> 04:05.144
GHOSTBUSTERS!

04:05.211 --> 04:05.912
GHOSTBUSTERS?

04:05.979 --> 04:09.248
GHOSTBUSTERS.

04:10.416 --> 04:10.984
BETTER THAT THAN A RIFLE, HE

04:11.050 --> 04:12.118
SAYS.

04:12.185 --> 04:13.152
WHO YOU GONNA CALL?

04:13.219 --> 04:17.056
GHOSTBUSTERS!

04:17.390 --> 04:18.257
NOW LOOK, IF YOU TOLD

04:18.324 --> 04:19.425
ME "A RUSSIAN MAN TRAVELED SEVEN

04:19.492 --> 04:20.793
STRAIGHT DAYS TO CROSS THE

04:20.860 --> 04:21.494
BORDER WITH ALMOST NOTHING BUT

04:21.561 --> 04:22.462
HIS GUITAR AND NOW HE'S GOING TO

04:22.528 --> 04:23.396
PLAY YOU A LITTLE SOMETHING" MY

04:23.463 --> 04:25.732
GUESS AS TO WHAT THAT SOMETHING

04:25.798 --> 04:27.233
WAS WOULD HAVE BEEN, IN ORDER:

04:27.300 --> 04:28.835
SAD RUSSIAN FOLK SONG HIS MOTHER

04:28.901 --> 04:29.936
USED TO PLAY AT NIGHT; SAD

04:30.003 --> 04:30.837
RUSSIAN FOLK SONG HIS MOTHER

04:30.903 --> 04:31.537
USED TO PLAY IN THE MORNING; AND

04:31.604 --> 04:34.641
WONDERWALL.

04:34.974 --> 04:35.775
BUT IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN ME

04:35.842 --> 04:36.509
INFINITY GUESSES TO GET TO

04:36.576 --> 04:39.545
"ACOUSTIC GHOSTBUSTERS."

04:39.612 --> 04:40.713
THE WORRY IS THAT, IN PUTIN'S

04:40.780 --> 04:42.081
DESPERATION, HE MAY RESORT TO

04:42.148 --> 04:43.249
NUCLEAR WEAPONS-- A WORRY NOT

04:43.316 --> 04:44.784
ASSUAGED BY SIGHTS LIKE THIS

04:44.851 --> 04:46.019
PARADE OF PRO-KREMLIN SUPPORTERS

04:46.085 --> 04:47.153
IN MOSCOW, FEATURING A NUCLEAR

04:47.220 --> 04:48.688
MISSILE MASCOT WALKING DOWN THE

04:48.755 --> 04:50.356
STREET.

04:50.423 --> 04:52.025
SO IT'S NO WONDER UKRAINE IS

04:52.091 --> 04:53.059
STEPPING UP ITS CALLS FOR

04:53.126 --> 04:54.460
OUTSIDE HELP.

04:54.527 --> 04:55.862
ZELENSKY ADDRESSED THE G-7 THIS

04:55.928 --> 04:57.130
WEEK, AND UKRAINE'S DEFENSE

04:57.196 --> 04:58.931
MINISTRY'S TWITTER ACCOUNT

04:58.998 --> 05:00.099
POSTED THIS VIDEO, THANKING

05:00.166 --> 05:01.434
FRANCE FOR SUPPLYING IT WITH

05:01.501 --> 05:02.168
ARTILLERY-- AND ASKING FOR

05:02.235 --> 05:05.038
MORE.

05:34.400 --> 05:35.034
WHAT A WEIRD TIME TO BE

05:35.101 --> 05:37.170
ALIVE.

05:37.236 --> 05:38.638
THAT'S AN APPEAL FOR MILITARY

05:38.705 --> 05:40.339
AID, SET TO SERGE GAINSBOURG'S

05:40.406 --> 05:42.041
"JE T'AIME", AND FEATURING THE

05:42.108 --> 05:42.842
VISUALS OF AN E-CARD FROM

05:42.909 --> 05:44.110
JIBJAB.

05:44.177 --> 05:46.446
AND THE FACT THAT CAME FROM THE

05:46.512 --> 05:47.647
DEFENSE MINISTRY MEANS SOMEONE

05:47.714 --> 05:48.781
IN UKRAINE GOT A MILITARY ORDER

05:48.848 --> 05:50.850
OF "GO BE HORNY ON TWITTER" AND

05:50.917 --> 05:53.720
THEY ANSWERED THAT CALL.

05:53.786 --> 05:55.021
EIGHT MONTHS IN, THINGS IN

05:55.088 --> 05:56.355
UKRAINE ARE STILL EXTREMELY

05:56.422 --> 05:59.292
SERIOUS, AND THE ONLY THING WE

05:59.358 --> 06:00.226
CAN SAY WITH RELATIVE CERTAINTY

06:00.293 --> 06:01.728
RIGHT NOW IS THAT WHATEVER PUTIN

06:01.794 --> 06:03.730
DOES NEXT WILL BE MUCH LIKE "THE

06:03.796 --> 06:05.298
MADE WITH

06:05.364 --> 06:07.300
LOVE!": ILL-ADVISED, MESSY, AND

06:07.366 --> 06:10.036
SOMETHING ABSOLUTELY NOBODY BUT

06:10.103 --> 06:11.304
HIM WANTED.

06:11.370 --> 06:17.777
AND NOW, THIS.

06:17.844 --> 06:20.246
AND NOW, MORE ELECTRIFYING

06:20.313 --> 06:23.616
SMALL TALK FROM SAN ANTONIO'S

06:23.683 --> 06:25.118
DAYTIME WITH KIMBERLY AND ESTHER

06:25.184 --> 06:25.318
BAN.

06:25.384 --> 06:27.954
DAYTIME WITH KIMBERLY AND

06:28.020 --> 06:28.488
ESTHER BOND STARTS NOW.

06:28.554 --> 06:32.158
HAPPY THURSDAY.

WE ARE HAPPY YOU ARE CHOOSING

06:46.339 --> 06:48.241

06:48.307 --> 06:50.376
IT'S A WONDERFUL WEDNESDAY.

06:50.443 --> 06:55.348
TRUE STORY.

06:55.414 --> 06:56.616
TRUE STORY.

06:56.682 --> 06:58.918
SPRING BREAK IS STILL GOING

06:58.985 --> 07:00.052
ON.

07:00.119 --> 07:01.220
TRUE STORY.

07:01.287 --> 07:03.055
IT'S A GOOD DAY.

07:03.122 --> 07:05.525
YOU ALWAYS PUT A LITTLE FLAIR

07:05.591 --> 07:06.159
ON IT.

07:06.225 --> 07:12.098
TEXAS IS MY HOME COUNTRY >>

07:12.165 --> 07:12.899
TRUE STORY.

07:12.965 --> 07:14.667
WELCOME TO DAYTIME, HAPPY

07:14.734 --> 07:19.138
FRIDAY WE ARE SO HAPPY YOU ARE

07:19.205 --> 07:19.539
HANGING WITH US.

07:19.605 --> 07:23.509
TRUE STORY.

07:23.576 --> 07:24.443
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT

07:24.510 --> 07:25.077
CONCERNS LGBTQ RIGHTS, SOMETHING

07:25.144 --> 07:25.845
WE'VE ACTUALLY GOTTEN BETTER AT

07:25.912 --> 07:26.813
DISCUSSING, GIVEN THAT THIS IS

07:26.879 --> 07:28.381
HOW CBS NEWS COVERED THE

07:28.447 --> 07:32.151
EXISTENCE OF GAY PEOPLE IN 1967.

07:32.218 --> 07:33.719
THE HOMOSEXUALS, WITH CBS

07:33.786 --> 07:35.354
NEWS CORRESPONDENT MIKE WALLACE.

07:35.421 --> 07:36.756
THERE IS A GROWING CONCERN

07:36.823 --> 07:38.057
ABOUT HOMOSEXUALS IN SOCIETY,

07:38.124 --> 07:38.958
ABOUT THEIR INCREASING

07:39.025 --> 07:41.227
VISIBILITY.

07:41.294 --> 07:42.628
THIS MAN IS 27, COLLEGE

07:42.695 --> 07:43.796
EDUCATED.

07:43.863 --> 07:45.031
HE WAS UNABLE TO HOLD A JOB

07:45.097 --> 07:45.765
BECAUSE OF HIS INABILITY TO

07:45.832 --> 07:46.632
CONTAIN HIS HOMOSEXUAL

07:46.699 --> 07:50.770
INCLINATIONS.

07:50.837 --> 07:51.737
OKAY, THAT'S A BIG

07:51.804 --> 07:52.305
"YIKES" FROM ME-- FROM THE

07:52.371 --> 07:53.072
WILDLY HOMOPHOBIC LANGUAGE; TO

07:53.139 --> 07:54.707
THE FACT THIS MAN'S IDENTITY WAS

07:54.774 --> 07:55.975
CONCEALED BY PLACING HIM BEHIND

07:56.042 --> 07:58.411
A PLANT, TO THE TITLE "THE

07:58.477 --> 08:01.314
HOMOSEXUALS" WHICH SOUNDS LESS

08:01.380 --> 08:03.115
LIKE THE NAME OF A NEWS REPORT

08:03.182 --> 08:04.016
AND MORE LIKE HOW YOUR GRANDPA

08:04.083 --> 08:06.452
REFERS TO THE FAB FIVE.

08:06.519 --> 08:07.386
SPECIFICALLY, WE'RE GOING TO

08:07.453 --> 08:09.288
TALK ABOUT TRANSGENDER RIGHTS.

08:09.355 --> 08:10.189
WE ACTUALLY FIRST TALKED ABOUT

08:10.256 --> 08:12.225
THIS SEVEN YEARS AGO, AND THE

08:12.291 --> 08:13.492
GOOD NEWS IS, SINCE THEN, MORE

08:13.559 --> 08:14.493
PEOPLE DO SEEM COMFORTABLE

08:14.560 --> 08:15.394
COMING OUT AS TRANS AND GENDER

08:15.461 --> 08:16.429
NONCONFORMING.

08:16.495 --> 08:17.430
WHICH IS GREAT!

08:17.496 --> 08:19.599
BUT AS YOU'VE UNDOUBTEDLY

08:19.665 --> 08:21.033
NOTICED, IN THE PAST FEW YEARS

08:21.100 --> 08:22.034
SOME ON THE RIGHT HAVE TRULY

08:22.101 --> 08:23.469
LOST THEIR MINDS ABOUT TRANS

08:23.536 --> 08:25.137
RIGHTS, PERHAPS BEST

08:25.204 --> 08:27.106
ENCAPSULATED BY THEIR NEW

08:27.173 --> 08:28.574
FAVORITE JOKE.

08:28.641 --> 08:30.376
MY NAME IS J.R.

08:30.443 --> 08:31.711
MAJEWSKI, AND MY PRONOUNS ARE

08:31.777 --> 08:34.380
PATRIOT AND ASS KICKER.

08:34.447 --> 08:35.348
MY PRONOUNS?

08:35.414 --> 08:38.317
CONSERVATIVE.

08:38.384 --> 08:41.020
PATRIOT.

08:41.087 --> 08:42.054
I'D LIKE TO DECLARE SOMETHING

08:42.121 --> 08:42.455
RIGHT NOW.

08:42.521 --> 08:46.192
MY PRONOUNS ARE U-S-A.

08:46.259 --> 08:47.360
HOW BOUT IT.

08:47.426 --> 08:53.065
I'M TED CRUZ, AND MY PRONOUN

08:53.132 --> 08:53.633
IS "KISS MY ASS."

08:53.699 --> 08:54.533
I DO NOT LIKE THAT MAN

08:54.600 --> 08:54.800
TED CRUZ.

08:54.867 --> 08:55.568
I DO NOT LIKE HIS SHITTY VIEWS.

08:55.635 --> 08:56.769
I DO NOT LIKE HIM SAYING "ASS,"

08:56.836 --> 08:58.971
DO NOT LIKE HIM SERVING SASS.

08:59.038 --> 09:00.339
I DO NOT LIKE HIM IN A SEAT, DO

09:00.406 --> 09:01.274
NOT LIKE HIM HOLDING MEAT.

09:01.340 --> 09:02.842
I DO NOT LIKE HIM WHEN HE'S

09:02.909 --> 09:03.709
SMOOCHIN', I DO NOT LIKE HIM

09:03.776 --> 09:05.778
WITH MNUCHIN.

09:05.845 --> 09:07.046
HATE HIS STUPID PRONOUN BIT.

09:07.113 --> 09:08.681
THAT MAN TED CRUZ IS FULL OF

09:08.748 --> 09:11.350
SHIT.

09:11.417 --> 09:12.585
BUT IT'S CLEARLY MORE THAN JUST

09:12.652 --> 09:14.186
BAD JOKES-- THIS YEAR ALONE,

09:14.253 --> 09:15.721
OVER 100 ANTI TRANS BILLS HAVE

09:15.788 --> 09:17.089
BEEN INTRODUCED IN STATE HOUSES,

09:17.156 --> 09:18.391
AND 12 STATES HAVE SIGNED OR

09:18.457 --> 09:19.659
ENACTED THEM, WITH ALL OF THIS

09:19.725 --> 09:21.594
HAPPENING AGAINST A BACKDROP OF

09:21.661 --> 09:23.029
VIOLENCE AND THREATS, INCLUDING

09:23.095 --> 09:24.497
ATTACKS AND HARASSMENT AIMED AT

09:24.563 --> 09:25.731
HOSPITALS PROVIDING GENDER

09:25.798 --> 09:28.267
AFFIRMING CARE TO YOUTH.

09:28.334 --> 09:29.635
AND FRUSTRATINGLY, THERE ARE

09:29.702 --> 09:30.636
MANY ON THE LEFT WHO SEEM AT

09:30.703 --> 09:32.204
BEST RELUCTANT TO ENGAGE ON THIS

09:32.271 --> 09:37.243
ISSUE, AND AT WORST OUTRIGHT

09:37.310 --> 09:38.210
HOSTILE TO IT, EITHER

09:38.277 --> 09:39.078
COMPLAINING ABOUT "PRONOUN

09:39.145 --> 09:39.946
POLICE", OR ARGUING THAT THIS

09:40.012 --> 09:40.579
ISSUE WILL COST DEMOCRATS

09:40.646 --> 09:41.681
ELECTIONS.

09:41.747 --> 09:44.483
IF YOU GO TO THE MIDDLE OF

09:44.550 --> 09:46.018
THE COUNTY, PEOPLE WOULD SAY IF

09:46.085 --> 09:47.553
YOUR CONVERSATION DURING A

09:47.620 --> 09:48.754
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IS ABOUT

09:48.821 --> 09:50.389
SOME GUY WEARING A DRESS AND

09:50.456 --> 09:52.658
WHETHER HE, SHE, OR IT CAN GO

09:52.725 --> 09:54.260
TO-AND-AND GO TO THE LOCKER ROOM

09:54.327 --> 09:55.294
WITH THEIR DAUGHTER, THAT'S NOT

09:55.361 --> 09:57.430
A WINNING FORMULA FOR MOST

09:57.496 --> 09:57.997
PEOPLE.

09:58.064 --> 09:59.031
WOW.

09:59.098 --> 10:00.166
"IT"?

10:00.232 --> 10:01.434
MICHAEL BLOOMBERG CAN FUCK ALL

10:01.500 --> 10:05.371
THE WAY OFF.

10:05.438 --> 10:06.138
ALSO WHILE THIS FUN-SIZED

10:06.205 --> 10:07.506
BILLIONAIRE IS CLEARLY GOOD AT A

10:07.573 --> 10:09.175
LOT OF THINGS-- LIKE MAKING

10:09.241 --> 10:10.076
MONEY, AND END OF LIST-- MAYBE

10:10.142 --> 10:11.143
DON'T TAKE ADVICE ON A "WINNING

10:11.210 --> 10:12.345
FORMULA" FOR ELECTIONS FROM A

10:12.411 --> 10:13.813
MAN WHO SPENT OVER OVER A

10:13.879 --> 10:14.947
BILLION DOLLARS OF HIS OWN MONEY

10:15.014 --> 10:16.515
TO LOSE A PRESIDENTIAL BID IN

10:16.582 --> 10:19.318
JUST 14 WEEKS.

10:19.385 --> 10:20.753
BUT SET ASIDE THE NOTION THAT

10:20.820 --> 10:22.288
IT'S WORTH SACRIFICING

10:22.355 --> 10:23.556
PROTECTIONS FOR A VULNERABLE

10:23.622 --> 10:24.390
GROUP, TO CHASE A "WINNING

10:24.457 --> 10:25.825
FORMULA."

10:25.891 --> 10:27.326
LET'S ALSO REMEMBER THAT IT'S

10:27.393 --> 10:28.661
NOT ACTUALLY "THE LEFT" TALKING

10:28.728 --> 10:30.563
ABOUT TRANS RIGHTS NON-STOP--

10:30.629 --> 10:31.764
IT'S REPUBLICANS, WHO SEE AN

10:31.831 --> 10:37.903
ADVANTAGE IN DEMAGOGUING THIS

10:37.970 --> 10:38.971
ISSUE.

10:39.038 --> 10:39.839
AND TO IGNORE THAT IS TO ALLOW

10:39.905 --> 10:40.639
THEM TO HAVE REAL, CALAMITOUS

10:40.706 --> 10:41.841
IMPACTS ON PEOPLE'S LIVES.

10:41.907 --> 10:44.010
A FEW YEARS AGO, VICE PROFILED A

10:44.076 --> 10:44.977
GIRL NAMED KAI SHAPPLEY.

10:45.044 --> 10:46.178
AND JUST WATCH HOW HAPPY SHE IS,

10:46.245 --> 10:47.013
TALKING ABOUT HER HOPES FOR HER

10:47.079 --> 10:48.080
FUTURE, UNTIL SHE REMEMBERS

10:48.147 --> 10:51.150
SOMETHING THAT CHANGES HER MOOD.

10:51.217 --> 10:51.951
MAMA SAYS I MIGHT GROW UP TO

10:52.018 --> 10:54.220
BE PRESIDENT."

10:54.286 --> 10:54.954
YEAH?

10:55.021 --> 10:55.554
MM-HM.

10:55.621 --> 10:56.288
WHAT WOULD YOU CHANGE ABOUT

10:56.355 --> 10:58.657
THE WORLD IF YOU WERE PRESIDENT?

10:58.724 --> 11:01.327
LET TRANS PEOPLE BE FREE AND

11:01.394 --> 11:02.228
GO TO THE BATHROOM THEY WANT TO

11:02.294 --> 11:04.497
GO TO.

11:04.563 --> 11:05.297
ARE YOU ABLE TO USE THE

11:05.364 --> 11:08.834
GIRLS' BATHROOM AT SCHOOL?

11:08.901 --> 11:10.036
NO, AND NOW THEY JUST PUT

11:10.102 --> 11:13.339
SECURITY GUARDS UP FOR THE

11:13.406 --> 11:17.643
BATHROOM SECURITY OR WHATEVER.

11:17.710 --> 11:19.912
OH, I HATE THAT.

11:19.979 --> 11:21.480
THAT'S BRUTAL.

11:21.547 --> 11:22.114
IT'S SO DARK THAT IT'S GENUINELY

11:22.181 --> 11:23.049
HARD TO WATCH.

11:23.115 --> 11:24.617
WHICH WOULD ALSO COINCIDENTALLY,

11:24.683 --> 11:26.118
BE A PRETTY ACCURATE TAGLINE FOR

11:26.185 --> 11:28.587
"HOUSE OF THE DRAGON."

11:28.654 --> 11:30.456
BUT THE POINT IS, GIVEN WHAT'S

11:30.523 --> 11:31.991
AT STAKE HERE, TONIGHT, LET'S

11:32.058 --> 11:33.692
TALK ABOUT THIS LATEST ROUND OF

11:33.759 --> 11:34.427
ATTACKS ON TRANS RIGHTS, WHERE

11:34.493 --> 11:35.461
IT'S COMING FROM, AND WHAT IT'S

11:35.528 --> 11:36.796
DOING.

11:36.862 --> 11:37.797
WE'RE GOING

11:37.863 --> 11:39.098
TO BE TAKING THE ARGUMENTS

11:39.165 --> 11:40.099
BEHIND A LOT OF THESE ANTI-TRANS

11:40.166 --> 11:42.568
BILLS SERIOUSLY, BECAUSE OF WHAT

11:42.635 --> 11:43.169
THEY'RE DOING, BUT NOT

11:43.235 --> 11:45.004
SINCERELY, BECAUSE SO OFTEN,

11:45.071 --> 11:46.839
THEY SEEM TO BE BASED MORE ON

11:46.906 --> 11:48.040
POLITICAL CALCULATION THAN ON

11:48.107 --> 11:49.708
WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING.

11:49.775 --> 11:51.143
A GOOD EXAMPLE IS THAT IN RECENT

11:51.210 --> 11:52.144
YEARS, 18 STATES HAVE PASSED

11:52.211 --> 11:54.713
LAWS AIMED AT "PROTECTING YOUTH

11:54.780 --> 11:56.082
SPORTS", AND SOUTH DAKOTA

11:56.148 --> 11:57.316
GOVERNOR KRISTI NOEM EVEN MADE

11:57.383 --> 11:58.117
HER STATE'S BILL A CENTERPIECE

11:58.184 --> 12:00.486
OF A CAMPAIGN AD.

12:00.553 --> 12:01.687
IN SOUTH DAKOTA, ONLY GIRLS

12:01.754 --> 12:03.489
PLAY GIRLS' SPORTS.

12:03.556 --> 12:04.723
WHY?

12:04.790 --> 12:06.692
BECAUSE OF GOVERNOR KRISTI

12:06.759 --> 12:07.693
NOEM'S LEADERSHIP.

12:07.760 --> 12:08.861
NOEM HAS BEEN PROTECTING GIRLS'

12:08.928 --> 12:10.096
SPORTS FOR YEARS AND NEVER

12:10.162 --> 12:11.497
BACKED DOWN.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.332
NOW, GOVERNOR NOEM HAS A BILL

12:13.399 --> 12:14.567
THAT WILL GIVE SOUTH DAKOTA THE

12:14.633 --> 12:16.469
STRONGEST LAW IN THE NATION

12:16.535 --> 12:18.571
PROTECTING FEMALE SPORTS.

12:18.637 --> 12:19.338
DOING THE WORK, DELIVERING

12:19.405 --> 12:20.473
RESULTS.

12:20.539 --> 12:22.508
GOVERNOR KRISTI NOEM.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.777
IF YOU'D TIME TRAVELLED

12:24.844 --> 12:26.112
HERE FROM THE PAST AND THE FIRST

12:26.178 --> 12:27.046
THING YOU SAW WAS THIS AD, YOU'D

12:27.113 --> 12:28.347
THINK TWO THINGS.

12:28.414 --> 12:29.849
WOW, THE CAMPAIGN CENTERS

12:29.915 --> 12:31.717
AROUND YOUTH SPORTS, I GUESS

12:31.784 --> 12:33.285
LITERALLY EVERY OTHER PROBLEM IN

12:33.352 --> 12:34.453
AMERICA HAS BEEN SOLVED.

12:34.520 --> 12:35.588
SHE IS "NOT" PULLING

12:35.654 --> 12:37.556
OFF THAT COWBOY HAT.

12:37.623 --> 12:38.791
AND YOU'D BE RIGHT-- ABOUT THE

12:38.858 --> 12:40.192
HAT PART.

12:40.259 --> 12:42.695
PEOPLE LIKE NOEM LOVE STOKING

12:42.761 --> 12:43.629
FEAR OVER THE SPECTER OF TRANS

12:43.696 --> 12:44.830
ATHLETES-- GIRLS, SPECIFICALLY

12:44.897 --> 12:46.065
HAVING AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE,

12:46.132 --> 12:46.832
AND TAKING AWAY SCHOLARSHIP

12:46.899 --> 12:48.134
OPPORTUNITIES.

12:48.200 --> 12:49.568
BUT THERE ARE VANISHINGLY FEW

12:49.635 --> 12:51.270
EXAMPLES NATIONWIDE OF TRANS

12:51.337 --> 12:52.004
ATHLETES ATTEMPTING TO COMPETE

12:52.071 --> 12:58.878
AT ALL.

12:58.944 --> 12:59.612
IN NOEM'S STATE SPECIFICALLY,

12:59.678 --> 13:00.579
THE HEAD OF THEIR HIGH SCHOOL

13:00.646 --> 13:01.480
SPORTS ASSOCIATION COULD NAME

13:01.547 --> 13:02.448
EXACTLY ONE TRANSGENDER FEMALE

13:02.515 --> 13:03.282
ATHLETE WHO'D COMPETED, AND WHO

13:03.349 --> 13:04.350
GRADUATED SEVERAL YEARS AGO.

13:04.416 --> 13:06.418
SO THERE ARE MORE ATHLETES "IN

13:06.485 --> 13:08.954
THIS SHOT" FROM NOEM'S AD, THEN

13:09.021 --> 13:10.256
THERE ARE TRANS GIRLS KNOWN TO

13:10.322 --> 13:10.856
HAVE COMPETED IN SOUTH DAKOTA

13:10.923 --> 13:12.525
SCHOOLS.

13:12.591 --> 13:13.359
BUT EVEN IF THERE WERE MORE,

13:13.425 --> 13:14.360
DISCRIMINATING AGAINST THEM

13:14.426 --> 13:15.394
WOULD STILL, OBVIOUSLY, BE

13:15.461 --> 13:17.897
WRONG.

13:17.963 --> 13:18.731
AND IT'D STILL BE WEIRD THAT

13:18.797 --> 13:19.532
STATE LEGISLATURES WERE GETTING

13:19.598 --> 13:20.366
INVOLVED IN DECISIONS USUALLY

13:20.432 --> 13:21.333
MADE BY ORGANIZATIONS GOVERNING

13:21.400 --> 13:23.269
THE SPORTS IN QUESTION.

13:23.335 --> 13:25.704
AND IT'S WORTH KNOWING: EVEN AT

13:25.771 --> 13:26.839
THE ELITE LEVEL, CONVERSATIONS

13:26.906 --> 13:28.941
AROUND THIS AREN'T BEING HANDLED

13:29.008 --> 13:34.346
WITH FLAT-OUT BANS.

13:34.413 --> 13:35.114
THE I-O-C HAS ANNOUNCED IT'LL

13:35.181 --> 13:35.948
SET RULES ON A SPORT-BY-SPORT

13:36.015 --> 13:36.782
BASIS, BUT WORKING ON THE

13:36.849 --> 13:37.716
GENERAL PRINCIPLE THAT "NO

13:37.783 --> 13:38.918
ATHLETE SHOULD BE EXCLUDED FROM

13:38.984 --> 13:39.919
COMPETITION ON THE ASSUMPTION OF

13:39.985 --> 13:41.086
AN ADVANTAGE DUE TO THEIR

13:41.153 --> 13:42.321
GENDER."

13:42.388 --> 13:43.689
AND IT'S PRETTY REMARKABLE THAT

13:43.756 --> 13:44.924
A TRANS ATHLETE COULD

13:44.990 --> 13:46.725
THEORETICALLY COMPETE IN THE

13:46.792 --> 13:47.960
OLYMPICS, BUT NOT SOUTH DAKOTA

13:48.027 --> 13:50.930
UNDER-12 SOCCER.

13:50.996 --> 13:52.565
A SPORT THAT GENUINELY ONLY

13:52.631 --> 13:54.366
EXISTS TO OBLITERATE PARENTS'

13:54.433 --> 13:56.135
WEEKENDS.

13:56.202 --> 13:59.405
STATES' BLUNT-FORCE APPROACH HAS

13:59.471 --> 14:00.239
LED TO ABSURD SITUATIONS LIKE

14:00.306 --> 14:01.507
THAT OF MACK BEGGS, WHO AS A

14:01.574 --> 14:02.474
TEXAS HIGH SCHOOLER WANTED TO

14:02.541 --> 14:04.543
WRESTLE BOYS, BUT WAS FORCED BY

14:04.610 --> 14:06.278
STATE RULES TO WRESTLE GIRLS.

14:06.345 --> 14:07.413
WHEN HE WON A STATE

14:07.479 --> 14:09.181
CHAMPIONSHIP, LAWMAKERS TRIED TO

14:09.248 --> 14:10.182
PASS A LAW THAT WOULD'VE MADE IT

14:10.249 --> 14:11.383
IMPOSSIBLE FOR ATHLETES LIKE HIM

14:11.450 --> 14:14.286
TO COMPETE, PERIOD.

14:14.353 --> 14:15.454
WHICH IS ABSURD, BECAUSE AS ONE

14:15.521 --> 14:17.356
OF THE WRESTLERS MACK ACTUALLY

14:17.423 --> 14:18.824
DEFEATED POINTED OUT, NONE OF

14:18.891 --> 14:19.725
THESE PEOPLE SEEMED TO THINK

14:19.792 --> 14:20.593
THROUGH THE REALITY OF MACK'S

14:20.659 --> 14:21.961
SITUATION.

14:22.027 --> 14:24.129
DO YOU REALLY HONESTLY THINK

14:24.196 --> 14:25.564
SOMEONE WOULD CHANGE THEIR

14:25.631 --> 14:26.599
ENTIRE GENDER JUST SO THEY WOULD

14:26.665 --> 14:30.502
WIN STATE?

14:30.569 --> 14:33.272
NO, THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS.

14:33.339 --> 14:34.173
RIGHT, THIS OBVIOUSLY

14:34.240 --> 14:35.941
WASN'T AN EFFORT TO CHEAT.

14:36.008 --> 14:37.643
KIDS AREN'T PLOTTING BIG,

14:37.710 --> 14:39.078
DECEITFUL SCHOOL SPORTS-RELATED

14:39.144 --> 14:40.879
CHEATING SCHEMES JUST TO GET

14:40.946 --> 14:41.914
WHAT THEY WANT-- YOU'RE

14:41.981 --> 14:46.952
THINKING OF LORI LOUGHLIN.

14:47.019 --> 14:48.320
THAT'S WHO YOU'RE THINKING OF

14:48.387 --> 14:50.556
HERE, YOU ARE CONFUSED.

14:50.623 --> 14:51.290
SO MUCH OF THE CONVERSATION

14:51.357 --> 14:52.057
AROUND ANTI-TRANS LAWS INVOLVES

14:52.124 --> 14:52.858
MASSIVELY OVERHEATED RHETORIC

14:52.925 --> 14:53.726
THAT DOESN'T MATCH THE REALITY

14:53.792 --> 14:54.793
OF KIDS' ACTUAL SITUATIONS.

14:54.860 --> 14:55.961
AND INTERESTINGLY, A LOT OF IT'S

14:56.028 --> 14:57.863
BEEN FUELED BY SOME OF THE SAME

14:57.930 --> 14:59.932
PLAYERS BEHIND THE CRITICAL RACE

14:59.999 --> 15:01.233
THEORY PANIC, WHO, AS WE

15:01.300 --> 15:02.568
DISCUSSED IN FEBRUARY, WERE

15:02.635 --> 15:03.902
USING IT AS A WEDGE ISSUE TO

15:03.969 --> 15:05.070
PROMOTE SCHOOL CHOICE.

15:05.137 --> 15:06.939
IN FACT, ONE KEY ARCHITECT OF

15:07.006 --> 15:08.440
THE C-R-T PANIC, CHRISTOPHER

15:08.507 --> 15:14.046
RUFO, RECENTLY PIVOTED TO

15:14.113 --> 15:14.847
ATTACKING TRANS RIGHTS, AND HAS

15:14.913 --> 15:15.748
OPENLY DISCUSSED THE STRATEGY

15:15.814 --> 15:16.248
BEHIND THAT.

15:16.315 --> 15:17.383
WHAT I'M LOOKING AT AND IT'S

15:17.449 --> 15:19.051
JUST KIND OF AN ONGOING SERIES,

15:19.118 --> 15:21.320
I JUST STARTED IT, IS TO TAKE

15:21.387 --> 15:22.321
THAT SAME SYSTEM OF REPORTING,

15:22.388 --> 15:23.088
THAT SAME STYLE OF REPORTING AS

15:23.155 --> 15:25.324
I DID WITH CRITICAL RACE THEORY.

15:25.391 --> 15:25.958
BUT NOW TAKING A LOOK AT GENDER

15:26.025 --> 15:27.226
IDEOLOGY.

15:27.293 --> 15:28.594
WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IS,

15:28.661 --> 15:31.297
PARENTS ARE FEELING THAT,

15:31.363 --> 15:32.231
THEY'RE FEELING THE OOF THIS IS

15:32.298 --> 15:33.399
KIND OF WEIRD, I'M KIND OF

15:33.465 --> 15:34.166
UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THIS, BUT I'M

15:34.233 --> 15:35.734
SCARED TO SPEAK OUT.

15:35.801 --> 15:37.803
AND SO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS WE

15:37.870 --> 15:41.206
HAVE TO GIVE THEM THE KIND OF

15:41.273 --> 15:42.608
MEDIA NARRATIVE KIND OF A

15:42.675 --> 15:43.609
JUSTIFICATION OR VALIDATION OR

15:43.676 --> 15:45.544
SUBSTANTIATION OF THEIR CONCERNS

15:45.611 --> 15:46.245
TO SAY, "HEY, THIS IS THE KIND

15:46.312 --> 15:47.813
OF THING THEY'RE TEACHING IN

15:47.880 --> 15:48.881
SCHOOLS.' AND THEN WE HAVE TO

15:48.947 --> 15:50.282
GIVE THEM THE LANGUAGE WHERE

15:50.349 --> 15:54.086
THEY CAN SPEAK ABOUT IT WITH

15:54.153 --> 15:55.020
CONFIDENCE.

15:55.087 --> 15:56.822
THEY CAN SPEAK ABOUT IT DIRECTLY

15:56.889 --> 15:57.456
AND THEY CAN SPEAK ABOUT IT WITH

15:57.523 --> 15:59.391
THE REQUISITE LEVEL OF

15:59.458 --> 16:01.493
AGGRESSIVENESS THAT IT'S GOING

16:01.560 --> 16:03.862
TO TAKE TO SAY, "HEY, WAIT A

16:03.929 --> 16:06.432
MINUTE, WE HAVE TO STOP THIS.'

16:06.498 --> 16:07.032
YEAH, HE'S BASICALLY

16:07.099 --> 16:07.566
GIVING PEOPLE A SCRIPT TO

16:07.633 --> 16:08.367
REPEAT.

16:08.434 --> 16:09.101
SAY WHAT YOU WANT ABOUT CHRIS

16:09.168 --> 16:10.069
RUFO-- LIKE, FOR INSTANCE, THAT

16:10.135 --> 16:11.670
HE'S A FEAR-MONGERING TROLL WHO

16:11.737 --> 16:12.671
LOOKS LIKE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF

16:12.738 --> 16:13.472
SOMEONE MADE THE RECIPE FOR RYAN

16:13.539 --> 16:14.340
GOSLING, BUT FORGOT TO ADD THE

16:14.406 --> 16:17.343
HOTNESS-- HE IS VERY DELIBERATE

16:17.409 --> 16:19.778
IN HOW HE TRIES TO INFLUENCE

16:19.845 --> 16:20.612
PUBLIC OPINION.

16:20.679 --> 16:23.482
RUFO'S SUGGESTED BRANDING THE

16:23.549 --> 16:24.683
DISCUSSION OF TRANS ISSUES UNDER

16:24.750 --> 16:26.652
THE UMBRELLA OF "RADICAL GENDER

16:26.719 --> 16:28.721
THEORY", AND TWEETED OUT THAT

16:28.787 --> 16:32.124
"CONSERVATIVES SHOULD START

16:32.191 --> 16:33.258
USING THE PHRASE "TRANS

16:33.325 --> 16:34.026
STRIPPER" IN LIEU OF "DRAG

16:34.093 --> 16:34.993
QUEEN."

16:35.060 --> 16:36.929
IT HAS A MORE LURID SET OF

16:36.995 --> 16:37.496
CONNOTATIONS AND SHIFTS THE

16:37.563 --> 16:38.764
DEBATE TO SEXUALIZATION."

16:38.831 --> 16:39.398
AND SURE-- ANYTHING CAN HAVE A

16:39.465 --> 16:40.299
MORE LURID AND SEXUAL SET OF

16:40.366 --> 16:41.333
CONNOTATIONS IF YOU JUST RENAME

16:41.400 --> 16:42.368
IT.

16:42.434 --> 16:43.202
I'LL SHOW YOU: RAIN?

16:43.268 --> 16:44.903
"SKY JIZZ."

16:44.970 --> 16:45.337
MUCH WORSE.

16:45.404 --> 16:45.938
IMMERSION BLENDER?

16:46.004 --> 16:46.705
"SOUP VIBRATOR."

16:46.772 --> 16:47.339
SPAGHETTI SAUCE?

16:47.406 --> 16:48.374
"NOODLE LUBE."

16:48.440 --> 16:50.175
SEE, IT WORKS ON ANYTHING!

16:50.242 --> 16:54.146
BUT IN THE CONSERVATIVE

16:54.213 --> 16:54.813
PLAYBOOK, THAT TACTIC IS A BIG

16:54.880 --> 16:55.948
ONE-- -- LINKING DISCUSSION OF

16:56.014 --> 16:56.482
GENDER IDENTITY TO SEXUAL

16:56.548 --> 16:56.982
PREDATION AND TEACHERS

16:57.049 --> 16:58.584
"GROOMING" STUDENTS.

16:58.650 --> 16:59.852
A RELATED TACTIC IS ARGUING THAT

16:59.918 --> 17:01.220
THE RISE IN KIDS IDENTIFYING AS

17:01.286 --> 17:03.455
TRANS IS DUE TO A "SOCIAL

17:03.522 --> 17:04.390
CONTAGION"-- THAT IT'S JUST A

17:04.456 --> 17:05.591
MASS DELUSION, A TRENDY FAD

17:05.657 --> 17:07.025
THAT'S RAPIDLY SPREADING AMONG

17:07.092 --> 17:08.727
YOUNG PEOPLE.

17:08.794 --> 17:11.063
JUST LISTEN TO ABIGAIL SHRIER, A

17:11.130 --> 17:12.498
VOCAL PROPONENT OF THAT THEORY,

17:12.564 --> 17:14.466
LAYING IT ALL OUT.

17:14.533 --> 17:16.101
IF YOU WANT TO SEE BRAINWASH,

17:16.168 --> 17:17.569
CHECK OUT THESE YOUNG TEENAGERS

17:17.636 --> 17:18.837
WHO SUDDENLY DECIDE THEY'RE

17:18.904 --> 17:20.305
TRANSGENDER THEY IMMEDIATELY CUT

17:20.372 --> 17:21.407
OFF THEIR FAMILIES.

17:21.473 --> 17:22.107
THEY VERY OFTEN DROP OUT OF

17:22.174 --> 17:23.041
SCHOOL.

17:23.108 --> 17:24.376
THEY ARE VERY OFTEN START

17:24.443 --> 17:27.513
TATTOOING THEMSELVES AND USING

17:27.579 --> 17:28.747
DRUGS AND THEY ARE CREATING A-A

17:28.814 --> 17:30.115
WORLD FOR THEMSELVES THAT IS SO

17:30.182 --> 17:31.683
HEALTHY, SO BUILT AROUND

17:31.750 --> 17:33.085
SEXUALITY, AND THE-THEY LOSE ALL

17:33.152 --> 17:33.652
THEIR HOBBIES.

17:33.719 --> 17:34.253
THEIR ONLY HOBBY IS BEING

17:34.319 --> 17:37.122
TRANSGENDER.

17:37.189 --> 17:38.490
OKAY, SO THERE'S A LOT

17:38.557 --> 17:39.224
THERE, BUT LET ME JUST ADDRESS

17:39.291 --> 17:40.492
THE CLAIM THAT TRANS KIDS LOSE

17:40.559 --> 17:41.527
ALL THEIR HOBBIES.

17:41.593 --> 17:42.995
I'LL POINT OUT THAT WHEN THEY

17:43.061 --> 17:44.163
TRY TO HAVE SOME-- LIKE, I

17:44.229 --> 17:46.064
DUNNO, SCHOOL SPORTS, FOR

17:46.131 --> 17:47.366
EXAMPLE-- A BUNCH OF ASSHOLE

17:47.433 --> 17:49.868
ADULTS TRY TO KEEP THEM FROM IT.

17:49.935 --> 17:51.003
SHRIER SOMETIMES DRESSES HER

17:51.069 --> 17:52.204
ARGUMENT UP BY USING THE TERM

17:52.271 --> 17:54.640
"RAPID-ONSET GENDER DYSPHORIA",

17:54.706 --> 17:57.109
WHICH IS TOTAL HORSESHIT.

17:57.176 --> 17:58.377
IT COMES FROM A STUDY PUBLISHED

17:58.444 --> 18:01.013
BY A RESEARCHER IN 2018,

18:01.079 --> 18:01.680
HYPOTHESIZING THAT SOME KIDS

18:01.747 --> 18:02.648
IDENTIFY AS TRANS DUE TO PEER

18:02.714 --> 18:04.049
PRESSURE.

18:04.116 --> 18:05.784
THAT

18:05.851 --> 18:07.085
STUDY WAS BASED ON A SURVEY OF

18:07.152 --> 18:09.788
PARENTS, NOT ACTUAL TRANS KIDS,

18:09.855 --> 18:11.089
AND IT TARGETED PARENTS FROM

18:11.156 --> 18:13.725
ORGANIZATIONS DEDICATED TO

18:13.792 --> 18:16.695
OPPOSING TRANS IDEOLOGY.

18:16.762 --> 18:17.329
WHICH IS INSTANTLY

18:17.396 --> 18:18.230
DISQUALIFYING.

18:18.297 --> 18:19.164
IT'S LIKE CITING A STUDY

18:19.231 --> 18:20.732
CLAIMING THAT ALL POSTAL WORKERS

18:20.799 --> 18:21.834
ARE TERRIFYING HELL-DEMONS SENT

18:21.900 --> 18:23.168
TO ATTACK YOUR FAMILY, BUT THEN

18:23.235 --> 18:24.870
LEARNING THAT THE RESEARCHERS

18:24.937 --> 18:26.104
ONLY SURVEYED A COLLECTION OF

18:26.171 --> 18:28.073
ANXIOUS DOGS-- THAT'S SOME

18:28.140 --> 18:30.676
HEAVY SAMPLING BIAS THAT CLEARLY

18:30.742 --> 18:32.845
SKEWED YOUR RESULTS.

18:32.911 --> 18:36.582
AND TO BE VERY CLEAR, THERE'S

18:36.648 --> 18:37.483
AMPLE EVIDENCE OF GENDER

18:37.549 --> 18:38.317
VARIANCE THROUGHOUT HUMAN

18:38.383 --> 18:39.218
HISTORY, AND AS FAR BACK AS

18:39.284 --> 18:40.085
HISTORIANS HAVE FOUND EVIDENCE

18:40.152 --> 18:41.153
OF TRANS PEOPLE, THEY'VE FOUND

18:41.220 --> 18:43.455
TRANS CHILDREN.

18:43.522 --> 18:44.923
AS FOR THE "RAPID RISE" IN KIDS

18:44.990 --> 18:47.192
IDENTIFYING AS TRANS, AS THE

18:47.259 --> 18:48.760
WRITER JULIA SERANO HAS POINTED

18:48.827 --> 18:50.429
OUT, WHEN YOU LOOK AT A CHART OF

18:50.496 --> 18:52.397
LEFT-HANDEDNESS AMONG AMERICANS

18:52.464 --> 18:53.732
OVER THE 20TH CENTURY, YOU SEE A

18:53.799 --> 18:54.867
MASSIVE SPIKE WHEN WE STOPPED

18:54.933 --> 18:57.503
FORCING KIDS TO WRITE WITH THEIR

18:57.569 --> 18:59.271
RIGHT HAND, AND THEN A PLATEAU

18:59.338 --> 19:01.273
THAT DOESN'T MEAN EVERYONE

19:01.340 --> 19:03.775
BECAME LEFT-HANDED OR THERE WAS

19:03.842 --> 19:06.078
A "RAPID ONSET SOUTHPAW

19:06.144 --> 19:07.246
DYSPHORIA", IT MEANS PEOPLE WERE

19:07.312 --> 19:08.146
FREE TO BE WHO THEY FUCKING

19:08.213 --> 19:11.383
WERE.

19:11.450 --> 19:12.150
AND TO THE EXTENT THAT SOME

19:12.217 --> 19:13.018
YOUNG PEOPLE ARE JUST EXPLORING

19:13.085 --> 19:13.619
THEIR GENDER IDENTITY, HOW IS

19:13.685 --> 19:16.188
THAT A BAD THING?

19:16.255 --> 19:18.457
WHO THE FUCK ARE THEY HURTING?

19:18.524 --> 19:19.591
WATCHING THE CONVERSATION AROUND

19:19.658 --> 19:21.727
THIS, IT'S HARD NOT TO FEEL

19:21.793 --> 19:23.362
LIKE, TO THE EXTENT THERE IS ANY

19:23.428 --> 19:25.264
"SOCIAL CONTAGION" HERE, IT'S

19:25.330 --> 19:27.432
AMONG ADULTS, WHO'VE WHIPPED

19:27.499 --> 19:29.601
THEMSELVES INTO SUCH A FRENZY

19:29.668 --> 19:30.469
THAT THEY CAN FIND THEMSELVES

19:30.536 --> 19:31.103
REPEATING SOME HUMILIATING

19:31.169 --> 19:33.071
NONSENSE.

19:33.138 --> 19:34.306
PERHAPS THE STUPIDEST OF WHICH

19:34.373 --> 19:35.307
IS A NEW TALKING POINT ABOUT

19:35.374 --> 19:36.508
WHAT ACCOMMODATING CHILDREN'S

19:36.575 --> 19:38.577
GENDER IDENTITY HAS LED TO.

19:38.644 --> 19:41.146
I EVEN HEARD FROM ONE PERSON

19:41.213 --> 19:42.214
WHO RECENTLY SAID THAT A

19:42.281 --> 19:48.053
THAT-THAT A STUDENT IDENTIFIED

19:48.120 --> 19:51.490
AS A CAT AND WANTED A LITTER

19:51.557 --> 19:52.190
BOX.

19:52.257 --> 19:52.925
THEY THINK THEY'RE A CAT, A

19:52.991 --> 19:54.359
CAT.

19:54.426 --> 19:56.461
THEY PUT TAILS ON AND THEY

19:56.528 --> 19:57.462
DEMAND THAT THEY HAVE A LITTER

19:57.529 --> 19:58.997
BOX IN THE SCHOOL.

19:59.064 --> 20:00.532
WE'VE LITERALLY GOT KIDS WHO

20:00.599 --> 20:02.367
THINK THEY'RE CATS AND DOGS

20:02.434 --> 20:03.201
USING LITTER BOXES IN

20:03.268 --> 20:07.539
CLASSROOMS.

20:07.606 --> 20:08.173
I'M STILL HEARING FROM

20:08.240 --> 20:08.941
STUDENTS AND PARENTS.

20:09.007 --> 20:09.741
THEY BELIEVE THERE IS A LITTER

20:09.808 --> 20:11.109
BOX IN THAT SCHOOL.

20:11.176 --> 20:12.611
AND WHEN EVERYBODY WILL TURN THE

20:12.678 --> 20:14.379
OTHER CHEEK TO ALLEGATIONS.

20:14.446 --> 20:16.048
A RUMOR IS JUST A RUMOR UNTIL IT

20:16.114 --> 20:18.650
BECOMES TRUE.

20:18.717 --> 20:20.018
THE FACT YOU SEEM TO

20:20.085 --> 20:21.119
GENUINELY THINK THAT'S HAPPENING

20:21.186 --> 20:23.455
IS JUST HEARTBREAKINGLY STUPID.

20:23.522 --> 20:25.424
BECAUSE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT

20:25.490 --> 20:26.291
FOR LITERALLY TWO SECONDS, THE

20:26.358 --> 20:27.826
WHOLE THING FALLS APART.

20:27.893 --> 20:31.330
FOR ONE, IF KIDS WERE USING

20:31.396 --> 20:33.231
LITTER BOXES IN CLASS, A STATE

20:33.298 --> 20:34.399
REPRESENTATIVE FROM MINNESOTA

20:34.466 --> 20:35.534
WOULDN'T BE THE ONE BREAKING

20:35.601 --> 20:36.501
THAT NEWS TO YOU.

20:36.568 --> 20:37.302
YOU WOULD HAVE FUCKING HEARD

20:37.369 --> 20:38.670
ABOUT IT.

20:38.737 --> 20:41.139
IF A KID SHAT IN A LITTERBOX IN

20:41.206 --> 20:42.207
FIRST PERIOD, IT WOULD BE THE

20:42.274 --> 20:43.408
ONLY THING ANYONE IN THAT STATE

20:43.475 --> 20:45.677
WAS TALKING ABOUT BY LUNCH.

20:45.744 --> 20:48.347
MINNESOTA WOULD CHANGE ITS STATE

20:48.413 --> 20:49.948
MOTTO TO "MINNESOTA-- Y'KNOW,

20:50.015 --> 20:50.983
THE STATE WHERE THAT KID SHIT IN

20:51.049 --> 20:54.953
A LITTERBOX."

20:55.020 --> 20:56.021
AND NOTABLY, YOUNG PEOPLE ARE

20:56.088 --> 20:57.322
SHOWING UP IN PUBLIC FORUMS

20:57.389 --> 20:59.291
WHERE ADULTS ARE FEARMONGERING

20:59.358 --> 21:00.525
ABOUT LETTING TRANS KIDS INTO

21:00.592 --> 21:01.994
YOUTH SPORTS AND BATHROOMS, AND

21:02.060 --> 21:02.928
TRYING TO TALK SOME SENSE INTO

21:02.995 --> 21:04.630
THEM.

21:04.696 --> 21:06.565
I WILL NOT LET A BOARD FULL

21:06.632 --> 21:07.633
OF PEOPLE WHO BARELY REPRESENT

21:07.699 --> 21:09.234
ME TELL ME WHO I AM AND WHAT I

21:09.301 --> 21:11.336
CAN DO.

21:11.403 --> 21:13.572
GROW UP AND FIX YOUR BEHAVIOR.

21:13.639 --> 21:14.673
I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT A TRANS

21:14.740 --> 21:15.907
PERSON HARASSING ME, I'M WORRIED

21:15.974 --> 21:16.942
ABOUT IF I'M GONNA FAIL SPANISH

21:17.009 --> 21:18.210
IN MY NEXT CLASS.

21:18.276 --> 21:20.479
I HAVE USED THESE BATHROOMS

21:20.545 --> 21:21.647
REPEATEDLY ALONGSIDE TRANS

21:21.713 --> 21:22.981
PEOPLE AND HAVE NEVER ONCE FELT

21:23.048 --> 21:24.983
THREATENED.

21:25.050 --> 21:25.884
YOU KNOW WHO I HAVE FELT

21:25.951 --> 21:27.185
THREATENED BY?

21:27.252 --> 21:28.320
THE ACTIONS OF THIS SCHOOL

21:28.387 --> 21:29.755
BOARD.

21:29.821 --> 21:31.356
YOU'VE EMBARRASSED

21:31.423 --> 21:32.257
YOURSELVES, GARDNER, AND THE

21:32.324 --> 21:33.158
STATE OF KANSAS, FOR YOUR LACK

21:33.225 --> 21:33.992
OF KNOWLEDGE IN SEX AND GENDER

21:34.059 --> 21:35.160
STUDIES.

21:35.227 --> 21:36.795
YOU'VE ALSO HIGHLIGHTED THE

21:36.862 --> 21:37.896
SEVERELY INADEQUATE SEX

21:37.963 --> 21:40.132
EDUCATION WE GIVE OUR STUDENTS

21:40.198 --> 21:41.800
TODAY.

21:41.867 --> 21:42.934
YEAH, THE ADULTS IN

21:43.001 --> 21:45.103
THOSE ROOMS JUST GOT HUMILIATED

21:45.170 --> 21:46.371
BY TEENAGERS-- AS WE ALL KNOW,

21:46.438 --> 21:47.105
THE MOST BRUTAL FORM OF

21:47.172 --> 21:49.141
HUMILIATION THERE IS.

21:49.207 --> 21:50.509
AND CREDIT TO THOSE TEENAGERS

21:50.575 --> 21:51.810
FOR SHOWING UP, AND SKIPPING

21:51.877 --> 21:53.045
WHATEVER YOUNG PEOPLE ARE DOING

21:53.111 --> 21:54.713
THESE DAYS, LIKE HANGING OUT AT

21:54.780 --> 21:55.681
THE VAPE TOK STORE OR WHATEVER

21:55.747 --> 21:56.782
I DON'T KNOW, I'LL BE DEAD

21:56.848 --> 21:59.951
SOON.

22:00.018 --> 22:01.653
SO MUCH OF THE FEAR OF AND

22:01.720 --> 22:03.088
ARGUMENTS AGAINST TRANSGENDER

22:03.155 --> 22:04.089
PEOPLE SEEMS TO FLOW FROM

22:04.156 --> 22:04.690
MISINFORMATION AND

22:04.756 --> 22:05.824
MISUNDERSTANDING.

22:05.891 --> 22:06.925
AND MAYBE THE BIGGEST AND MOST

22:06.992 --> 22:08.427
DANGEROUS AREA OF IGNORANCE

22:08.493 --> 22:09.094
SURROUNDS THE CONCEPT OF

22:09.161 --> 22:11.196
"GENDER-AFFIRMING CARE."

22:11.263 --> 22:13.131
IN RECENT YEARS, FOUR STATES

22:13.198 --> 22:14.399
HAVE ENACTED BANS OR

22:14.466 --> 22:15.467
RESTRICTIONS ON YOUTH ACCESS TO

22:15.534 --> 22:16.468
IT, AND OVER A DOZEN MORE HAVE

22:16.535 --> 22:17.602
CONSIDERED SIMILAR LEGISLATION

22:17.669 --> 22:19.471
THIS YEAR ALONE.

22:19.538 --> 22:21.606
AND THEY'VE BEEN FUELED BY A

22:21.673 --> 22:23.141
LACK OF BASIC KNOWLEDGE AROUND

22:23.208 --> 22:24.342
WHAT GENDER AFFIRMING CARE

22:24.409 --> 22:26.712
ACTUALLY CONSISTS OF, SUMMED UP

22:28.880 --> 22:30.348
IF A CHILD WALKED INTO A

22:30.415 --> 22:30.982
DOCTOR'S OFFICE AND SAID, "DOC,

22:31.049 --> 22:32.718
I WANT YOU TO CUT MY FINGERS

22:32.784 --> 22:34.152
OFF.' THE DOC WOULD SAY, "YOU'VE

22:34.219 --> 22:34.920
GOT SOME PROBLEMS, KID.

22:34.986 --> 22:39.524
WE NEED TO REFER YOU TO A

22:39.591 --> 22:40.492
PSYCHIATRIST.'

22:40.559 --> 22:41.460
IF THE SAME CHILD WALKS INTO

22:41.526 --> 22:42.060
THAT DOCTOR'S OFFICE AND SAYS,

22:42.127 --> 22:42.861
"DOC, I WANT YOU TO CUT MY

22:42.928 --> 22:43.895
UTERUS OUT,' THE DOCTOR WOULD

22:43.962 --> 22:44.663
SAY-THAT DOCTOR WOULD SAY, "OH,

22:44.730 --> 22:45.831
WELL, YOU'RE A WONDERFUL, BRAVE

22:45.897 --> 22:47.566
PERSON.

22:47.632 --> 22:48.867
YOU'RE SO RIGHT.

22:48.934 --> 22:50.368
WE DO NEED TO CUT YOUR UTERUS

22:50.435 --> 22:51.703
OUT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

22:51.770 --> 22:53.038
LET'S GET THIS YOUNG LADY OVER

22:53.105 --> 22:59.711
TO THE OPERATING ROOM.

22:59.778 --> 23:02.914
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

23:02.981 --> 23:04.883
EVERY BIT OF THAT IS UNREALISTIC

23:04.950 --> 23:06.818
STARTING WITH NO ONE IN THIS

23:06.885 --> 23:12.057
COUNTRY HAS BEEN ABLE TO HAVE A

23:12.124 --> 23:14.126
CONVERSATION WITH THE DOCTOR

23:14.192 --> 23:14.860
WITHOUT FIRST DISCUSSING

23:14.926 --> 23:15.127
INSURANCE

23:15.193 --> 23:15.727
TO THE NOTION OF A YOUNG CHILD

23:15.794 --> 23:16.194
USING THE TERM "DOC."

23:16.261 --> 23:16.795
WHY IS THE FICTIONAL CHILD IN

23:16.862 --> 23:17.763
THIS BULLSHIT SCENARIO USING THE

23:17.829 --> 23:18.830
SAME VOCABULARY AS A CHAOTIC

23:18.897 --> 23:19.464
RABBIT FROM THE NINETEEN

23:19.531 --> 23:20.298
FORTIES?

23:20.365 --> 23:21.266
NONE OF THIS MAKES SENSE.

23:21.333 --> 23:22.167
BUT TO HEAR SOME TELL IT, AS

23:22.234 --> 23:23.001
SOON AS A CHILD DECLARES

23:23.068 --> 23:23.835
THEMSELVES TRANS, THERE IS AN

23:23.902 --> 23:24.836
IMMEDIATE, IRREVERSIBLE,

23:24.903 --> 23:31.443
SURGICAL DECISION UNDERTAKEN.

23:31.510 --> 23:32.277
AND THERE JUST ISN'T!

23:32.344 --> 23:33.078
SO LET'S BREAK DOWN EXACTLY WHAT

23:33.145 --> 23:33.712
"GENDER-AFFIRMING CARE" CONSISTS

23:33.779 --> 23:34.246
OF.

23:34.312 --> 23:35.080
BECAUSE, IN YOUNGER CHILDREN, IT

23:35.147 --> 23:35.814
CAN MEAN NOTHING MORE THAN A

23:35.881 --> 23:36.848
SOCIAL TRANSITION-- LIKE

23:36.915 --> 23:38.016
CALLING THEM BY A NEW NAME, OR

23:38.083 --> 23:39.017
GIVING THEM A NEW HAIRCUT OR

23:39.084 --> 23:40.118
CLOTHING-- OR PROVIDING THEM

23:40.185 --> 23:40.952
WITH PSYCHOLOGICAL OR BEHAVIORAL

23:41.019 --> 23:42.387
SUPPORTS.

23:42.454 --> 23:43.588
BECAUSE, TO BE CLEAR:

23:43.655 --> 23:44.623
PRE-PUBESCENT CHILDREN ARE NOT

23:44.689 --> 23:45.490
ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAL

23:45.557 --> 23:48.393
INTERVENTIONS.

23:48.460 --> 23:50.862
NOW, AT THE ONSET OF PUBERTY, AN

23:50.929 --> 23:51.530
ADOLESCENT AND THEIR FAMILY

23:51.596 --> 23:53.431
MIGHT CONSIDER PUBERTY BLOCKERS

23:53.498 --> 23:55.500
HORMONES THAT DELAY PUBERTY.

23:55.567 --> 23:57.435
AND IMPORTANTLY, IF THAT

23:57.502 --> 23:58.637
TREATMENT IS SUSPENDED, THEN

23:58.703 --> 23:59.871
PUBERTY WILL RESUME, MEANING

23:59.938 --> 24:01.406
THIS IS "REVERSIBLE."

24:01.473 --> 24:02.974
THINK OF IT LIKE A PAUSE BUTTON

24:03.041 --> 24:04.109
THE THING THAT YOU CAN'T DO

24:04.176 --> 24:07.746
EASILY ON THE H-B-O MAX APP.

24:07.813 --> 24:09.147
NOW, THE NEXT POTENTIAL MEDICAL

24:09.214 --> 24:10.315
INTERVENTION IS USUALLY HORMONE

24:10.382 --> 24:11.616
THERAPY, WHICH BOOSTS LEVELS OF

24:11.683 --> 24:13.618
TESTOSTERONE OR ESSSTROGEN.

24:13.685 --> 24:15.020
OPPONENTS OF GENDER-AFFIRMING

24:15.086 --> 24:16.254
CARE MAKE A LOT OF ALARMIST

24:16.321 --> 24:17.589
CLAIMS ABOUT HORMONE THERAPY--

24:17.656 --> 24:18.757
FROM SAYING IT'S EXPERIMENTAL,

24:18.824 --> 24:20.458
WHICH IT'S NOT, TO ARGUING THAT

24:20.525 --> 24:21.960
IT STERILIZES PEOPLE.

24:22.027 --> 24:23.995
FOR SOME, IN SPECIFIC

24:24.062 --> 24:25.230
SITUATIONS, THERE CAN BE RISKS

24:25.297 --> 24:26.832
TO FERTILITY.

24:26.898 --> 24:29.568
BUT FOR OTHERS, THE EFFECT IS

24:29.634 --> 24:30.435
ANTICIPATED TO BE REVERSIBLE, IF

24:30.502 --> 24:31.736
THE MEDICATION IS DISCONTINUED.

24:31.803 --> 24:32.771
BUT THERE IS DEFINITELY AN

24:32.838 --> 24:34.539
INFORMED DECISION TO BE MADE

24:34.606 --> 24:37.576
THERE.

24:37.642 --> 24:38.510
AND YOU'LL NOTICE THAT NONE OF

24:38.577 --> 24:39.711
WHAT I'VE MENTIONED SO FAR IS

24:39.778 --> 24:40.612
SURGERY.

24:40.679 --> 24:42.013
BUT WHEN IT DOES COME TO THAT,

24:42.080 --> 24:42.914
SOME TEENS MAY BE ELIGIBLE, FOR

24:42.981 --> 24:43.882
INSTANCE, FOR "TOP SURGERY", OR

24:43.949 --> 24:45.183
CHEST MASCULINIZATION.

24:45.250 --> 24:46.484
NOT ONLY IS

24:46.551 --> 24:48.253
THAT PRETTY RARE, IT-- LIKE ALL

24:48.320 --> 24:50.288
OF THIS-- WOULD ONLY HAPPEN

24:50.355 --> 24:52.691
AFTER A TEAM OF MEDICAL

24:52.757 --> 24:55.994
PROFESSIONALS DISCUSSED ALL ITS

24:56.061 --> 24:57.629
RISKS AND BENEFITS WITH THEIR

24:57.696 --> 24:58.430
PATIENT AND THEIR PATIENT'S

24:58.496 --> 24:59.831
PARENT OR GUARDIAN, ALL OF WHOM

24:59.898 --> 25:01.099
WOULD HAVE TO SIGN OFF.

25:01.166 --> 25:02.601
IT'S A LONG, INVOLVED PROCESS,

25:02.667 --> 25:04.936
EVEN BEFORE YOU GET TO THE FACT

25:05.003 --> 25:06.338
THAT IT'S INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE,

25:06.404 --> 25:07.339
WHICH IS WHY WORKING-CLASS

25:07.405 --> 25:08.273
FAMILIES, FAMILIES OF COLOR AND

25:08.340 --> 25:09.274
PEOPLE WITH LESS RESOURCES ARE

25:09.341 --> 25:11.176
WAY LESS ABLE TO ACCESS IT.

25:11.243 --> 25:12.244
BASICALLY, NO KID IS CASUALLY

25:12.310 --> 25:13.311
DROPPING INTO AN OPERATING ROOM

25:13.378 --> 25:14.312
BECAUSE THEY JUST DECIDED TO GET

25:14.379 --> 25:15.280
THEIR UTERUS REMOVED WITH THE

25:15.347 --> 25:17.883
IMPULSIVE RECKLESSNESS NORMALLY

25:17.949 --> 25:26.625
ASSOCIATED WITH GETTING BANGS.

25:26.691 --> 25:27.092
THAT HAS AN ABSOLUTELY

25:27.158 --> 25:27.359
RIDICULOUS

25:27.425 --> 25:27.959
AND THE NOTION THAT THE STATE

25:28.026 --> 25:28.293
THING TO SAY.

25:28.360 --> 25:29.127
WOULD SUDDENLY INTERFERE IN ANY

25:29.194 --> 25:29.928
OF THIS IS UNDERSTANDABLY

25:29.995 --> 25:30.829
INFURIATING FOR BOTH TRANS KIDS

25:30.896 --> 25:32.764
AND THEIR PARENTS.

25:32.831 --> 25:33.999
JUST WATCH THIS MOM, IN ARKANSAS

25:34.065 --> 25:35.033
WHERE LEGISLATORS WERE

25:35.100 --> 25:36.134
BANNING, AMONG OTHER THINGS,

25:36.201 --> 25:38.103
HORMONE THERAPY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE

25:38.169 --> 25:39.437
DESCRIBE WHAT IT DID FOR HER

25:39.504 --> 25:41.373
SON, WHO SUFFERED FROM SEVERE

25:41.439 --> 25:43.708
DEPRESSION BEFORE TRANSITIONING.

25:43.775 --> 25:45.810
I'D SAY LIKE A MONTH TO TWO

25:45.877 --> 25:46.611
MONTHS IN, I STARTED SEEING THAT

25:46.678 --> 25:47.913
KID COME BACK, COME OUT OF HIS

25:47.979 --> 25:50.382
SHELL, TALK TO US MORE, LAUGH.

25:50.448 --> 25:51.016
WHAT DID THAT FEEL LIKE AS A

25:51.082 --> 25:52.050
MOM?

25:52.117 --> 25:53.852
IT WAS LIKE, THAT'S IT.

25:53.919 --> 25:54.920
THIS HAS-THIS HAS BEEN THE

25:54.986 --> 25:57.355
ANSWER ALL ALONG.

25:57.422 --> 25:58.023
WHY WOULD ANYBODY WANT TO TAKE

25:58.089 --> 25:59.024
THAT AWAY FROM THEM?

25:59.090 --> 26:02.460
THERE'S NO REASON WHY YOU SHOULD

26:02.527 --> 26:04.562
BE BUTTING INTO MY CARE FOR MY

26:04.629 --> 26:06.431
CHILD.

26:06.498 --> 26:07.032
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SAY TO

26:07.098 --> 26:08.400
THESE LEGISLATORS?

26:08.466 --> 26:09.668
FUCK YOU.

26:09.734 --> 26:11.169
RIGHT.

26:11.236 --> 26:14.172
BECAUSE TRANSITIONING ISN'T

26:14.239 --> 26:15.473
TAKING YOUR KID AWAY FROM YOU--

26:15.540 --> 26:18.810
IN SOME CASES, IT CAN BE GIVING

26:18.877 --> 26:19.210
YOU YOUR KID BACK.

26:19.277 --> 26:20.478
THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE

26:20.545 --> 26:21.513
INSTANCES WHERE IT'S OKAY TO

26:21.579 --> 26:22.547
BUTT INTO SOMEONE'S CARE FOR

26:22.614 --> 26:23.548
THEIR CHILD.

26:23.615 --> 26:25.650
THIS ISN'T PIG-PEN.

26:25.717 --> 26:27.852
DO YOU NEED HELP, PIG-PEN?

26:27.919 --> 26:29.788
BLINK YOUR FILTHY EYES IF YOU

26:29.854 --> 26:33.425
NEED HELP, PIG-PEN.

26:33.491 --> 26:37.862
THE BENEFITS OF PROVIDING CARE

26:37.929 --> 26:38.463
ARE IMMENSE, AND THE RISKS OF

26:38.530 --> 26:39.431
WITHHOLDING IT ARE DIRE.

26:39.497 --> 26:40.332
A SURVEY OF AROUND 28,000 TRANS

26:40.398 --> 26:41.166
PEOPLE FOUND THAT, OF THOSE WHO

26:41.232 --> 26:42.567
WANTED HORMONE THERAPY AND

26:42.634 --> 26:44.436
DIDN'T RECEIVE IT 58% REPORTED

26:44.502 --> 26:45.470
SUICIDAL THOUGHTS IN A GIVEN

26:45.537 --> 26:46.938
YEAR.

26:47.005 --> 26:49.140
WHICH IS WHY THE THREE MAJOR

26:49.207 --> 26:50.375
PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS OF

26:50.442 --> 26:51.776
CHILD AND ADOLESCENT DOCTORS,

26:51.843 --> 26:53.445
PSYCHOLOGISTS, AND PSYCHIATRISTS

26:53.511 --> 26:55.547
HAVE ENDORSED GENDER-AFFIRMING

26:55.613 --> 26:56.815
CARE AND CONDEMNED EFFORTS TO

26:56.881 --> 26:59.150
DENY IT.

26:59.217 --> 27:00.652
AND YOU MAY'VE SEEN OR HEARD

27:00.719 --> 27:01.486
FROM A SMALL SUBSET OF PEOPLE

27:01.553 --> 27:02.620
WHO "DETRANSITIONED."

27:02.687 --> 27:03.922
BUT IT'S WORTH KNOWING, SUCH

27:03.989 --> 27:05.023
CASES ARE RARE AND HIGHLY

27:05.090 --> 27:07.058
INDIVIDUALIZED.

27:07.125 --> 27:08.159
STUDIES SHOW AN AVERAGE OF JUST

27:08.226 --> 27:10.595
TWO PERCENT OF PEOPLE WHO

27:10.662 --> 27:12.163
TRANSITION EXPRESS REGRET, AND

27:12.230 --> 27:13.565
THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE

27:13.631 --> 27:14.933
WHO HAVE OPTED TO DETRANSITION,

27:15.000 --> 27:16.634
DID SO NOT BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN

27:16.701 --> 27:18.770
THEIR GENDER IDENTITY, BUT DUE

27:18.837 --> 27:20.138
TO EXTERNAL FACTORS, SUCH AS

27:20.205 --> 27:21.139
STIGMA AND LACK OF SOCIAL

27:21.206 --> 27:22.874
SUPPORT.

27:22.941 --> 27:24.576
AND LOOK-- I COULD KEEP READING

27:24.642 --> 27:26.845
YOU STATS AND STUDIES-- I "DO"

27:26.911 --> 27:28.413
LOVE DOING THAT.

27:28.480 --> 27:29.547
OR I COULD JUST LET YOU WATCH

27:29.614 --> 27:31.049
THIS BOY TALK ABOUT WHAT IT FELT

27:31.116 --> 27:31.850
LIKE TO HAVE SOMEONE ACTUALLY

27:31.916 --> 27:33.885
SEE HIM FOR WHO HE WAS.

27:33.952 --> 27:34.853
DYLAN EXPLAINED HOW AS EARLY

27:34.919 --> 27:36.221
AS FOURTH GRADE, HE'D HAD

27:36.287 --> 27:37.655
CONFUSING FEELINGS THAT

27:37.722 --> 27:39.090
STRETCHED ON UNTIL HIS TEENAGE

27:39.157 --> 27:41.826
YEARS.

27:41.893 --> 27:43.128
I REALLY WANTED TO CUT MY

27:43.194 --> 27:44.329
HAIR, LIKE, REALLY BAD.

27:44.396 --> 27:45.597
AND SO WHEN I DID THAT, THAT

27:45.663 --> 27:47.899
FELT REALLY GOOD.

27:47.966 --> 27:48.767
AND THEN I HELD THE DOOR FOR

27:48.833 --> 27:50.101
SOMEBODY AND THEY SAID THANK

27:50.168 --> 27:52.203
YOU, SIR, AND I WAS, LIKE, "OH,

27:52.270 --> 27:56.341
YEAH.

27:56.408 --> 27:59.010
THAT-YEAH, THAT.'

27:59.077 --> 27:59.911
JUST LITTLE THINGS-

27:59.978 --> 28:00.378
LITTLE THINGS.

28:00.445 --> 28:01.212
THAT "SIR' PUT WORDS TO HOW I

28:01.279 --> 28:04.049
WAS FEELING.

28:04.115 --> 28:04.716
AND I WAS LIKE, "OH, YEAH,

28:04.783 --> 28:05.250
THAT-THAT FELT NICE.'

28:05.316 --> 28:06.017
YEAH, THAT'S

28:06.084 --> 28:06.618
INCREDIBLE.

28:06.684 --> 28:07.419
FOR SOME, A HAIRCUT IS JUST A

28:07.485 --> 28:08.119
ROUTINE ACTIVITY WHERE YOU GO TO

28:08.186 --> 28:09.254
YOUR BARBER, ASK FOR THE

28:09.320 --> 28:10.455
"BUSINESS IN THE FRONT, BUSINESS

28:10.522 --> 28:11.556
IN THE BACK," AND LEAVE.

28:11.623 --> 28:13.191
BUT FOR A TRANS KID, IT CAN BE A

28:13.258 --> 28:14.059
LIFE-CHANGING EXPERIENCE.

28:14.125 --> 28:15.660
THAT BOY IS CURRENTLY SUING HIS

28:15.727 --> 28:16.795
STATE'S A-G, IN A TRIAL THAT

28:16.861 --> 28:18.363
STARTS TOMORROW.

28:18.430 --> 28:20.131
AND HE'S NOT THE ONLY TRANS KID

28:20.198 --> 28:20.932
WHO'S FOUND HIMSELF FORCED TO

28:20.999 --> 28:23.001
BECOME AN ACTIVIST.

28:23.068 --> 28:24.869
KAI, FROM EARLIER?

28:24.936 --> 28:27.705
SHE'S NOW 11, AND WENT TO THE

28:27.772 --> 28:29.407
TEXAS STATE LEGISLATURE LAST

28:29.474 --> 28:30.442
YEAR, TO SPEAK OUT AGAINST BILLS

28:30.508 --> 28:31.376
THAT WOULD BAN DOCTORS AND

28:31.443 --> 28:32.377
PARENTS FROM PROVIDING GENDER

28:32.444 --> 28:33.778
AFFIRMING CARE TO YOUNG PEOPLE.

28:33.845 --> 28:36.214
AND SHE FUCKING CRUSHED IT.

28:36.281 --> 28:37.515
HELLO, MY NAME IS KAI

28:37.582 --> 28:39.150
SHAPPLEY.

28:39.217 --> 28:40.718
I LOVE BALLET, MATH, SCIENCE,

28:40.785 --> 28:42.921
AND GEOLOGY.

28:42.987 --> 28:44.656
I SPEND MY FREE TIME WITH MY

28:44.722 --> 28:46.191
CATS, CHICKENS, FACETIMING MY

28:46.257 --> 28:47.926
FRIENDS, AND DREAMING OF WHEN I

28:47.992 --> 28:51.896
WILL FINALLY MEET DOLLY PARTON.

28:51.963 --> 28:53.565
I DO NOT LIKE SPENDING MY FREE

28:53.631 --> 28:54.766
TIME ASKING ADULTS TO MAKE GOOD

28:54.833 --> 28:59.270
CHOICES.

28:59.337 --> 29:00.238
IT JUST-IT MAKES ME SAD THAT

29:00.305 --> 29:02.941
SOME POLITICIANS USE TRANS KIDS

29:03.007 --> 29:03.908
LIKE ME TO GET VOTES FROM PEOPLE

29:03.975 --> 29:06.544
WHO HATE ME JUST BECAUSE I

29:06.611 --> 29:08.546
EXIST.

29:08.613 --> 29:10.915
GOD MADE ME.

29:10.982 --> 29:12.016
GOD LOVES ME FOR WHO I AM AND

29:12.083 --> 29:13.885
GOD DOES NOT MAKE MISTAKES.

29:13.952 --> 29:20.425
SHE IS AWESOME.

29:20.492 --> 29:21.025
I WHOLE-HEARTEDLY AGREE WITH

29:21.092 --> 29:21.893
ALMOST EVERYTHING SHE SAYS

29:21.960 --> 29:22.393
THERE.

29:22.460 --> 29:23.228
THOUGH IN THE INTEREST OF

29:23.294 --> 29:24.162
FAIRNESS GOD "DOES" MAKE

29:24.229 --> 29:24.963
MISTAKES, IF HE DIDN'T, HOW

29:25.029 --> 29:25.897
WOULD YOU EXPLAIN GOBLIN SHARKS.

29:25.964 --> 29:26.898
LOOK AT THIS FUCKIN' GUY.

29:26.965 --> 29:27.799
HE LOOKS LIKE AN EEL WEARING A

29:27.866 --> 29:28.700
SHARK COSTUME THAT DOESN'T QUITE

29:28.766 --> 29:29.801
FIT.

29:29.868 --> 29:32.937
A "SICK" EEL.

29:33.004 --> 29:33.571
"ERRGH."

29:33.638 --> 29:34.405
LOOK AT THIS MESS, IT LOOKS LIKE

29:34.472 --> 29:35.840
HE'S GOIN' "ERRGH."

29:35.907 --> 29:36.808
IF GOD DOESN'T MAKE MISTAKES,

29:36.875 --> 29:38.276
HOW DO YOU JUSTIFY THE EXISTENCE

29:38.343 --> 29:39.711
OF THIS STUPID CREEP THAT LOOKS

29:39.777 --> 29:40.745
LIKE A CHILD TRIED TO DRAW A

29:40.812 --> 29:43.948
XENOMORPH FROM MEMORY?

29:44.015 --> 29:46.251
AGAIN, I SUPPORT KAI WITH MY

29:46.317 --> 29:47.185
WHOLE HEART, BUT TO SAY GOD

29:47.252 --> 29:48.119
DOESN'T MAKE MISTAKES IS JUST

29:48.186 --> 29:48.920
NOT TRUE.

29:48.987 --> 29:50.054
HE DOES, AND THEY LOOK LIKE

29:50.121 --> 29:53.258
THIS.

29:53.324 --> 29:54.292
I'M GLAD KAI'S

29:54.359 --> 29:57.495
ADVOCATING FOR HERSELF.

29:57.562 --> 29:58.763
BUT IF A CHILD HAS TO BE AN

29:58.830 --> 30:03.401
ACTIVIST, WE HAVE ALREADY FAILED

30:03.468 --> 30:03.701
THAT CHILD.

30:03.768 --> 30:04.469
BECAUSE SHE SHOULD JUST GET TO

30:04.536 --> 30:06.037
BE A KID AND ENJOY HER LIFE.

30:06.104 --> 30:07.372
AND I'M ACTUALLY GLAD YOU GOT TO

30:07.438 --> 30:09.073
HEAR HER TALK ABOUT BALLET AND

30:09.140 --> 30:10.175
FACETIME AND DOLLY PARTON,

30:10.241 --> 30:10.942
BECAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING THAT,

30:11.009 --> 30:11.976
TOO OFTEN, GETS LEFT OUT OF

30:12.043 --> 30:13.211
THESE STORIES, AND THAT'S JOY.

30:13.278 --> 30:16.047
WHILE OPPONENTS OF TRANS RIGHTS

30:16.114 --> 30:18.516
WILL SAY THESE KIDS ARE EITHER A

30:18.583 --> 30:19.551
MENACE OR BRAINWASHED, THEIR

30:19.617 --> 30:20.618
DEFENDERS WILL OFTEN GRAVITATE

30:20.685 --> 30:21.452
TOWARD THE SAME SAD STATISTICS

30:21.519 --> 30:24.088
I'VE SHOWN YOU TONIGHT, OF

30:24.155 --> 30:26.057
DEPRESSION AND SUICIDE.

30:26.124 --> 30:28.793
AND WHILE THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE

30:28.860 --> 30:32.597
ON ONE LEVEL-- IT'S THE MOST

30:32.664 --> 30:34.532
DEVASTATING HARM THAT CAN BE

30:34.599 --> 30:35.767
INFLICTED BY THESE BILLS--

30:35.833 --> 30:36.834
IT'S NOT THE WHOLE STORY, WHICH

30:36.901 --> 30:37.969
IS THAT, WHEN SUPPORTED, TRANS

30:38.036 --> 30:38.636
KIDS CAN EXPERIENCE FULL,

30:38.703 --> 30:39.971
VIBRANT LIVES.

30:40.038 --> 30:41.072
BECAUSE TRANS PEOPLE ARE NOT BY

30:41.139 --> 30:42.473
DEFAULT UNHAPPIER OR MORE PRONE

30:42.540 --> 30:44.342
TO SUFFERING THAN EVERYONE ELSE.

30:44.409 --> 30:45.610
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE

30:45.677 --> 30:48.546
PUTTING ON THEM.

30:48.613 --> 30:52.383
YOU JUST SAW, WHO'S SUING HIS

30:52.450 --> 30:54.285
STATE A-G, WILL POINT OUT--

30:54.352 --> 30:55.153
HE'S GOT OTHER, TEENAGE-BOY

30:55.220 --> 30:55.587
STUFF GOING ON, TOO.

30:55.653 --> 30:56.554
I'M 15.

30:56.621 --> 30:57.956
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO DO THIS.

30:58.022 --> 30:59.390
I HAVE-SHOULDN'T HAVE TO SUE THE

30:59.457 --> 31:01.292
STATE OF ARKANSAS BECAUSE THEY

31:01.359 --> 31:03.895
ARE TRYING TO TELL ME HOW I CAN

31:03.962 --> 31:05.096
AND CAN'T LIVE.

31:05.163 --> 31:06.497
AND MY COLLECTION OF HATS AND MY

31:06.564 --> 31:07.632
TRANS FLAG THAT I GOT FOR

31:07.699 --> 31:09.467
CHRISTMAS.

31:09.534 --> 31:12.403
THIS SOFT-SPOKEN TEENAGER IS

31:12.470 --> 31:16.874
MORE COMFORTABLE IN HIS

31:16.941 --> 31:17.408
HE'S A BEARDED DRAGON.

31:17.475 --> 31:18.610
COME HERE.

31:18.676 --> 31:19.310
SURROUNDED BY HIS FISH AND

31:19.377 --> 31:19.877
BEARDED DRAGON LIZARDS.

31:19.944 --> 31:20.612
AND SO HE'S GOT A MISSING

31:20.678 --> 31:21.546
FOOT AND A CROOKED TAIL.

31:21.613 --> 31:23.414
AND, YOU KNOW, HE'S JUST-HE

31:23.481 --> 31:25.850
NEEDED AN EXTRA BIT OF LOVE.

31:25.917 --> 31:29.621
YEAH, DYLAN SHOULD GET

31:29.687 --> 31:30.455
TO BE A KID.

31:30.521 --> 31:31.289
AND SPEND HIS TIME WITH HIS

31:31.356 --> 31:32.590
COLLECTION OF HATS AND FEEDING

31:32.657 --> 31:33.858
HIS BEARDED DRAGONS.

31:33.925 --> 31:34.993
WHATEVER IT IS THAT BEARDED

31:35.059 --> 31:35.994
DRAGONS EAT.

31:36.060 --> 31:36.961
I WOULDN'T KNOW.

31:37.028 --> 31:38.029
I'VE NEVER OWNED A BEARDED

31:38.096 --> 31:39.030
DRAGON.

31:39.097 --> 31:39.764
ALTHOUGH I'D PROBABLY GET ALONG

31:39.831 --> 31:40.798
GREAT WITH THAT ONE BECAUSE I,

31:40.865 --> 31:41.733
TOO, AM A LOVE-STARVED PALE

31:41.799 --> 31:44.535
CREATURE WITH A LOPSIDED ASS.

31:44.602 --> 31:46.571
ALL THE KIDS WE'VE SEEN TONIGHT

31:46.638 --> 31:47.639
SHOULDN'T NEED TO BE ACTIVISTS

31:47.705 --> 31:50.074
THEY SHOULD GET TO DRESS HOW

31:50.141 --> 31:51.709
THEY WANT, GO TO THE RIGHT

31:51.776 --> 31:52.910
BATHROOM FOR THEM AND PLAY THE

31:52.977 --> 31:59.884
SPORTS THEY WANT TO PLAY.

31:59.951 --> 32:00.451
REMEMBER MACK?

32:00.518 --> 32:01.152
WHEN HE GOT TO COLLEGE, HE WAS

32:01.219 --> 32:01.753
PLACED ON THE MEN'S WRESTLING

32:01.819 --> 32:02.654
TEAM, AND LOOK HOW HAPPY THAT

32:03.421 --> 32:04.789
ALL I EVER WANTED TO DO WAS

32:04.856 --> 32:08.793
WRESTLE MEN, AND NOW THAT I AM,

32:08.860 --> 32:11.562
IT'S FREAKIN' DOPE.

32:11.629 --> 32:13.498
IT'S FREAKIN' DOPE.

32:13.564 --> 32:14.565
YEAH.

32:14.632 --> 32:15.800
IT IS FREAKIN' DOPE.

32:15.867 --> 32:17.969
DO YOU SEE THAT JOY?

32:18.036 --> 32:18.903
HOLD IT IN YOUR MIND GOING

32:18.970 --> 32:20.505
FORWARD.

32:20.571 --> 32:21.939
NOT BECAUSE THE ROAD AHEAD ISN'T

32:22.006 --> 32:23.541
ROUGH, BUT BECAUSE, AS THE TRANS

32:23.608 --> 32:25.310
ACTRESS MICHAELA JAE RODRIGUEZ

32:25.376 --> 32:26.511
POINTS OUT, IT'S IMPORTANT NOT

32:26.577 --> 32:27.245
TO LOSE SIGHT OF WHAT'S AT THE

32:27.312 --> 32:28.613
END OF IT.

32:28.680 --> 32:30.682
WHEN IT COMES TO LEGISLATIVES

32:30.748 --> 32:32.850
AND-AND LAWS BEING PASSED, WE

32:32.917 --> 32:33.951
HAVE TO CONSTANTLY STAY DILIGENT

32:34.018 --> 32:35.253
AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY DON'T

32:35.320 --> 32:36.854
GET PASSED AND CALL UP AS MUCH

32:36.921 --> 32:38.890
AS WE CAN, BUT I THINK ALSO

32:38.956 --> 32:39.891
WHILE DOING SO WE HAVE TO LIVE

32:39.957 --> 32:40.992
OUR LIVES, AND SHOW PEOPLE HOW

32:41.059 --> 32:42.660
HAPPY WE ARE.

32:42.727 --> 32:44.329
WE CAN'T LIVE IN THE SORROW,

32:44.395 --> 32:44.962
THOUGH THERE'S MANY STRUGGLES

32:45.029 --> 32:47.465
WHEN IT COMES TO US.

32:47.532 --> 32:49.734
IN THE TIMES OF ADVERSITY AND IN

32:49.801 --> 32:51.102
THE TIMES OF DESPAIR, I CHOOSE

32:51.169 --> 32:53.204
HOPE AND JOY, AND I LET THOSE

32:53.271 --> 32:55.039
SHOWER ALL OVER THOSE HATERS AND

32:55.106 --> 32:56.140
PEOPLE WHO DON'T SEE IT FIT FOR

32:56.207 --> 32:57.508
US.

32:57.575 --> 32:59.110
AND IT USUALLY WINS.

32:59.177 --> 33:03.881
IT HAS WON.

33:03.948 --> 33:04.482
EXACTLY.

33:04.549 --> 33:05.283
HOPE AND JOY ARE CRUCIAL.

33:05.350 --> 33:06.551
THEY'RE THE FUEL THAT POWERS THE

33:06.617 --> 33:07.919
ONGOING FIGHT FOR EQUALITY.

33:07.985 --> 33:11.823
AND WHILE THERE'S A LOT OF FEAR

33:11.889 --> 33:13.191
AND UNCERTAINTY RIGHT NOW, IT'S

33:13.257 --> 33:14.058
WORTH REMEMBERING THAT PROGRESS

33:14.125 --> 33:15.093
WHILE NOT ALWAYS LINEAR-- IS

33:15.159 --> 33:16.027
ALWAYS POSSIBLE.

33:16.094 --> 33:17.595
BECAUSE WE'RE WORKING TOWARD THE

33:17.662 --> 33:18.763
GOAL OF EVERY TRANS KID KNOWING

33:18.830 --> 33:19.864
THEY ARE LOVED, VALUED, AND

33:19.931 --> 33:20.898
INDISPENSABLE, AS

33:20.965 --> 33:22.200
DOLLY-PARTON-LOVING,

33:22.266 --> 33:24.635
WEIRD-PET-OWNING, FREAKING DOPE

33:24.702 --> 33:26.904
INDIVIDUALS, AND NEVER GOING

33:26.971 --> 33:28.873
BACK TO A POINT WHERE ANYONE

33:28.940 --> 33:30.842
FEELS THAT, IF THEY APPEAR ON

33:30.908 --> 33:32.543
T-V, THEY HAVE TO HIDE BEHIND A

33:32.610 --> 33:34.445
FUCKING PLANT.

33:34.512 --> 33:35.813
THAT'S OUR SHOW.

33:35.880 --> 33:40.051
THANKS SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

33:40.118 --> 33:42.687
WE ARE OFF NEXT WEEK.

33:42.754 --> 33:44.756
BACK OCTOBER 30TH.

33:44.822 --> 33:45.156
GOOD NIGHT.
