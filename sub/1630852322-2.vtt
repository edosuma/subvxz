I think she has better things
to do than...

42:32.840 --> 42:33.760
GEORGE: Matilda.

42:34.720 --> 42:37.000
Sorry I'm late.

42:38.160 --> 42:40.320
We'll leave
you two lovebirds to it.

42:40.320 --> 42:41.720
Nice to meet you, Martha.

42:41.720 --> 42:43.000
Come along, darling.

42:43.000 --> 42:44.720
Have a nice evening.

42:44.720 --> 42:47.080
Your aunts,
they said you like pansies.

42:49.280 --> 42:50.280
Sorry?

42:52.880 --> 42:55.040
Yes! I do.

42:55.040 --> 42:57.560
Thank you.
Please, take a seat.

43:08.240 --> 43:11.080
Dr. Daniel Lynch
suddenly found himself

43:11.080 --> 43:13.880
feeling oddly out of place
at a table where,

43:13.880 --> 43:18.640
only moments before,
he'd felt perfectly at home.

43:18.640 --> 43:20.680
Daniel.

43:20.680 --> 43:22.880
Daniel!
Wake up.

43:22.880 --> 43:24.480
What's gotten into you
this evening?

43:24.480 --> 43:26.640
Sorry.
Where were we?

43:27.840 --> 43:31.040
As for Matilda,

43:31.040 --> 43:33.960
the evening may not have
worked out as planned,

43:33.960 --> 43:36.600
but she was
nevertheless content.

43:36.600 --> 43:39.160
She was home
in her treasured Wildemarsh,

43:39.160 --> 43:41.480
reunited with
her beloved aunts,

43:41.480 --> 43:44.440
living above her favorite place
in the world,

43:44.440 --> 43:47.000
and doing a job
she cherished.

43:49.160 --> 43:51.320
And unbeknown to her,

43:51.320 --> 43:57.120
a fraction over 316 yards,
two feet, and eight inches away

43:57.120 --> 44:00.680
works a man who might --
justmight --

44:00.680 --> 44:02.760
be able to shed light

44:02.760 --> 44:06.120
on the riddle
of her mother's disappearance.

44:09.000 --> 44:09.840
