00:02.001 --> 00:03.094
Inertial dampers have failed.

00:03.169 --> 00:04.727
I can't get any response
from the field coils.

00:04.804 --> 00:05.862
Did you verify
the control inputs?

00:05.939 --> 00:06.906
Stand by.

00:07.941 --> 00:08.908
The inputs are blocked.

00:08.975 --> 00:10.602
We've got to flush
the plasma injectors.

00:12.045 --> 00:15.776
Or maybe it's just a phase
synchronization adjustment.

00:16.883 --> 00:19.977
-Plasma injectors.
-Plasma injectors.

00:20.053 --> 00:21.714
Right.

00:22.722 --> 00:24.986
Field coils responding.

00:25.091 --> 00:27.423
Inertial dampers back on line.

00:29.996 --> 00:31.691
That was not fair!

00:31.765 --> 00:32.959
As your flight instructor,

00:33.033 --> 00:35.627
it's my duty to prepare you
for anything, fair or not.

00:35.702 --> 00:38.671
Clogging someone's plasma
injectors is a dirty trick.

00:38.738 --> 00:41.536
Yes, well, I'm famous
for my dirty tricks, you know?

00:45.045 --> 00:46.979
W-What was that?

00:47.047 --> 00:50.073
I never said the simulation
was finished.

00:55.755 --> 00:58.849
Computer, evasive maneuvers.

01:06.099 --> 01:07.498
I'll be ready
for anything next time.

01:07.567 --> 01:09.592
Oh, sounds like
a challenge to me.

01:18.445 --> 01:19.503
Come in.

01:20.880 --> 01:22.905
I hope you have good news,
Commander.

01:22.982 --> 01:25.075
Based on this inventory,
our food reserves

01:25.151 --> 01:27.278
look to be down
to 30 percent of capacity.

01:27.353 --> 01:28.547
Good news and bad.

01:28.621 --> 01:30.748
We have located
an M-Class planet

01:30.824 --> 01:33.588
and it shows high amino acid
and protein readings.

01:33.660 --> 01:35.127
That should indicate
a healthy plant life.

01:35.195 --> 01:36.162
What's bad about it?

01:36.229 --> 01:37.389
It's a full day out of our way.

01:37.464 --> 01:38.692
I don't think
we have any choice.

01:38.765 --> 01:39.925
It's the first chance we've had

01:39.999 --> 01:42.092
to replenish
our supplies in weeks.

01:42.168 --> 01:43.135
And our long-range sensors

01:43.203 --> 01:44.636
can't confirm any plant life
on the surface.

01:44.704 --> 01:46.171
Why not?

01:46.239 --> 01:48.639
It's one strange planet,
Captain.

01:51.978 --> 01:53.411
It's shrouded.

01:53.480 --> 01:55.710
Vapors cover it like a curtain.

01:55.782 --> 01:57.943
EM disturbances
all over the atmosphere.

01:58.017 --> 01:59.041
Some of these readings

01:59.119 --> 02:01.178
suggest a planet
early in its evolution...

02:01.254 --> 02:02.915
almost like a primeval Earth.

02:03.022 --> 02:04.455
The people
in stellar cartography

02:04.524 --> 02:06.253
have already nicknamed it
"Planet Hell."

02:06.326 --> 02:08.351
So it might be
a wild goose chase.

02:08.428 --> 02:10.089
Captain, I don't know
what we'll find

02:10.163 --> 02:13.428
when we get to the surface...
flora or fauna, friend or foe.

02:13.500 --> 02:14.762
If we knew we'd find

02:14.834 --> 02:16.802
another M-Class planet soon,
I'd...

02:19.939 --> 02:22.908
Set a course for Planet Hell,
Commander.

04:34.474 --> 04:35.702
That was you?

04:35.775 --> 04:36.969
That was me.

04:37.043 --> 04:39.443
I'm impressed.

04:39.512 --> 04:43.710
I keep hearing my mother say,
"Practice, Harry, practice."

04:43.783 --> 04:46.718
So I ate Neelix's food
for a week

04:46.786 --> 04:48.515
and used my replicator rations.

04:48.588 --> 04:50.556
Play something for me.

04:50.623 --> 04:53.615
Well, I've only had it for
a few days, and I don't think...

04:53.693 --> 04:55.285
Oh, come on!
Play something.

04:55.361 --> 04:56.692
Just pretend I'm not here.

05:06.706 --> 05:08.333
Play something different.

05:09.375 --> 05:10.501
Different?

05:10.576 --> 05:13.909
Something... not so cheerful.

05:13.980 --> 05:15.106
Why?

05:15.181 --> 05:16.648
What, you don't take requests?

05:16.716 --> 05:19.048
Something bothering you, Paris?

05:20.620 --> 05:23.418
Oh, Harry.

05:23.489 --> 05:24.922
I'm in trouble.

05:24.991 --> 05:26.618
What's new?

05:26.693 --> 05:28.126
I think I'm in love.

05:28.194 --> 05:29.183
What's new?

05:29.262 --> 05:30.194
With Kes.

05:30.263 --> 05:31.195
Kes?!

05:31.264 --> 05:32.356
I know, I know!

05:32.432 --> 05:33.694
I never even saw it coming.

05:33.766 --> 05:35.825
I thought we were
just good buddies.

05:35.902 --> 05:38.564
But there she was, in my arms.

05:38.638 --> 05:39.627
In your arms?

05:39.706 --> 05:41.640
Paris... you didn't.

05:41.708 --> 05:44.677
What? Oh! No.

05:44.744 --> 05:46.439
I didn't.

05:46.512 --> 05:48.503
I wouldn't!

05:48.581 --> 05:50.947
She stumbled
during a flight simulation.

05:51.017 --> 05:53.952
I caught her.

05:54.020 --> 05:56.784
I held her for an instant.

05:59.192 --> 06:00.682
Are you going to play or not?

06:02.695 --> 06:05.425
A whole crew full of women
and I have to fall

06:05.498 --> 06:07.261
for the one I can't have.

06:07.333 --> 06:09.198
Why do I do this to myself?

06:10.503 --> 06:14.030
If you ask me,
I say you enjoy it.

06:14.107 --> 06:15.404
Enjoy it?

06:15.475 --> 06:17.238
Only thing that makes sense.

06:17.310 --> 06:18.902
You've been doing
the same thing to yourself

06:19.011 --> 06:20.376
your whole life...

06:20.446 --> 06:24.109
setting yourself up
for rejection.

06:24.183 --> 06:26.674
You must enjoy playing the part.

06:28.621 --> 06:31.613
Hey, don't knock it
if you haven't tried it.

06:31.691 --> 06:34.660
I just have to be more careful.

06:34.727 --> 06:36.718
I can't let myself
be alone with her.

06:36.796 --> 06:39.287
There's an old
Chinese expression...

06:39.365 --> 06:42.095
"Stay out of harm's way."

06:43.970 --> 06:45.801
That's not a Chinese expression.

06:45.872 --> 06:47.931
If it works, use it.

06:49.709 --> 06:51.176
Of course, it would
help a little

06:51.244 --> 06:53.712
if Kes and I weren't going
to be stuck on the same ship

06:53.780 --> 06:55.145
for the rest of our lives.

06:55.214 --> 06:56.943
That's a pessimistic view.

06:57.016 --> 06:58.142
I'm in a pessimistic mood.

06:58.217 --> 07:00.549
Play something pessimistic.

07:00.620 --> 07:03.589
Practice, Harry, practice.

07:19.739 --> 07:21.707
And then suddenly, we fell
into a subspace anomaly.

07:21.774 --> 07:23.105
None of the readings
made any sense.

07:23.176 --> 07:24.609
I didn't know what to do.

07:24.677 --> 07:26.474
It must have been
terrible for you.

07:26.546 --> 07:28.605
Uh, pepper, sweeting?

07:28.681 --> 07:31.741
Oh. Anyway, it was quite
a learning experience.

07:33.286 --> 07:37.484
I'm sure Lieutenant Paris
is a fine teacher.

07:40.293 --> 07:43.660
Oh, I almost forgot,
the Palliantyne peas.

07:48.401 --> 07:49.891
Uh...

07:49.969 --> 07:52.733
Hmm. Ever so lightly spiced.

08:14.093 --> 08:15.617
Analysis.

08:15.695 --> 08:18.163
High levels of trigemic vapors,

08:18.231 --> 08:20.256
but it should still
support humanoid life.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.460
Sick Bay to Bridge.

08:22.535 --> 08:25.231
Please turn to your emergency
medical holographic channel.

08:27.440 --> 08:28.771
I hope you don't mind
that I've been

08:28.841 --> 08:30.570
eavesdropping,
but I have something important

08:30.643 --> 08:31.575
to contribute.

08:31.644 --> 08:32.770
What is it, Doctor?

08:32.845 --> 08:34.676
Of course, it wouldn't
be necessary for me

08:34.746 --> 08:36.339
to eavesdrop, if I were included

08:36.414 --> 08:38.440
in these discussions as a matter
of operating protocol.

08:38.518 --> 08:39.610
Doctor...

08:39.684 --> 08:41.083
You should be aware
that trigemic vapors

08:41.153 --> 08:42.085
at the recorded levels

08:42.154 --> 08:44.918
can cause severe humanoid
skin irritations.

08:44.991 --> 08:47.255
Could you provide some sort of
skin protection that might help?

08:47.326 --> 08:48.486
I am whipping up

08:48.561 --> 08:50.927
a batch of dermal osmotic
sealant as we speak.

08:50.997 --> 08:52.931
Nevertheless, skin exposure

08:53.032 --> 08:54.932
to the atmosphere
should be limited.

08:55.001 --> 08:57.026
Noted, Doctor.
Thank you.

08:57.103 --> 09:02.439
Tell me, just how often
do you... eavesdrop?

09:03.809 --> 09:07.370
I am simply
trying to monitor issues

09:07.446 --> 09:09.607
involving the health
of the crew, Captain.

09:09.682 --> 09:12.810
When activated,
the emergency medical program

09:12.885 --> 09:14.216
establishes com-links

09:14.287 --> 09:17.347
with all key areas
of the ship, and I have...

09:17.423 --> 09:18.549
on occasion...

09:20.526 --> 09:23.859
I am a doctor, not a voyeur.

09:23.930 --> 09:26.160
I am programmed to be discreet.

09:26.232 --> 09:27.722
I'm sure.

09:27.800 --> 09:30.633
Commander Chakotay will discuss
operating protocols with you

09:30.703 --> 09:32.694
at the earliest opportunity.

09:32.772 --> 09:35.866
In the meantime,
no more eavesdropping, Doctor.

09:35.942 --> 09:37.671
-But, Captain, I...
-That's an order.

09:40.313 --> 09:41.905
There's another problem,
Captain.

09:42.014 --> 09:44.346
We won't be able
to transport to the surface

09:44.417 --> 09:46.851
because of the EM disturbances
in the atmosphere.

09:46.919 --> 09:49.353
They'll interfere
with our com-links, too.

09:49.422 --> 09:50.980
I'll have Mr. Kim take a look.

09:53.326 --> 09:56.318
Listen, why don't we take in
a holodeck program later?

09:56.395 --> 09:58.488
A MoliÃ©re comedy...
that'll cheer you up.

10:02.001 --> 10:04.060
I think I'll just eat later.

10:08.574 --> 10:09.541
Damn.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.042
What do you want to do?

10:11.110 --> 10:13.135
Very simple.
We just won't sit with her.

10:13.212 --> 10:14.201
But that's rude.

10:14.280 --> 10:15.747
No, that's smart.

10:15.815 --> 10:17.077
We'll make it look like

10:17.149 --> 10:19.242
we have Bridge operations
to discuss.

10:19.318 --> 10:24.221
Gentlemen, may I recommend
the Alfarian hair pasta today?

10:24.290 --> 10:25.723
Hair pasta?

10:25.791 --> 10:27.452
That is just an expression,
isn't it?

10:29.395 --> 10:30.419
Not at all.

10:30.496 --> 10:32.430
It's actually made
from the follicles

10:32.498 --> 10:34.125
of the mature Alfarian.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.930
We harvest the hair
during shedding season

10:37.003 --> 10:38.527
in early fall.

10:38.604 --> 10:41.300
It's very high in protein.

10:41.374 --> 10:42.807
Whatever.

10:42.875 --> 10:44.502
We just have a lot

10:44.577 --> 10:47.512
of Bridge operations
business to discuss.

10:49.148 --> 10:50.137
Yeah.

10:53.219 --> 10:55.847
Mr. Kim, please report
to the Bridge.

10:57.556 --> 10:59.319
Have a nice lunch.

11:28.888 --> 11:31.356
You subclass genus.

11:31.424 --> 11:33.517
I beg your pardon.

11:33.592 --> 11:35.389
Sitting with your backs
to each other

11:35.461 --> 11:38.396
like two strangers
waiting for a transport.

11:38.464 --> 11:40.864
That's supposed to fool me?

11:40.933 --> 11:43.595
Oh. A guy just can't win.

11:43.669 --> 11:46.137
Look, there is nothing
to fool you about.

11:46.205 --> 11:47.672
Really. I swear.

11:47.740 --> 11:49.605
Liar.

11:52.244 --> 11:54.269
What the hell are you doing?!

11:59.452 --> 12:00.885
I'll kill you!

12:00.986 --> 12:02.044
It's too late!

12:02.088 --> 12:06.650
I'm betting your hair pasta
already did the trick!

12:06.726 --> 12:09.718
Janeway to Lieutenant Paris
and Mr. Neelix.

12:09.795 --> 12:11.729
Go ahead.

12:11.797 --> 12:12.729
Yes, Captain?

12:12.798 --> 12:14.197
Please report to my ready room
right away.

12:14.266 --> 12:16.063
I have something important
to discuss with you.

12:16.135 --> 12:19.161
Uh, Captain, did you say
"right away"?

12:19.238 --> 12:20.364
If we could have...

12:20.439 --> 12:21.599
That's what I said, Mr. Paris.

12:21.674 --> 12:23.005
Janeway out.

12:37.289 --> 12:39.951
Would anyone care to explain?

12:42.595 --> 12:46.031
It might be too long to go
into right now, Captain.

12:48.300 --> 12:49.733
Very well.

12:49.802 --> 12:53.329
I have a mission
for the two of you.

12:53.405 --> 12:54.394
We have reason to believe

12:54.473 --> 12:56.270
that there are food sources
on this planet,

12:56.342 --> 12:58.674
but we can't transport
to the surface.

12:58.744 --> 13:00.336
You're going to take
a shuttle down

13:00.412 --> 13:01.640
and do a little scouting.

13:01.714 --> 13:04.148
M-M-Me... and him?

13:04.216 --> 13:06.343
He's our best pilot

13:06.418 --> 13:07.407
and you're our expert

13:07.486 --> 13:09.647
on edible plant species
in this Quadrant.

13:09.722 --> 13:13.089
Uh, Captain, I'm not one
to pass up a mission,

13:13.159 --> 13:14.683
but in this circumstance,

13:14.760 --> 13:17.854
maybe Ensign Baytart,
who is a fine pilot...

13:17.930 --> 13:20.592
There are electromagnetic
anomalies in the atmosphere

13:20.666 --> 13:22.361
and I would rather have you
at the helm.

13:22.434 --> 13:25.369
Am I...

13:25.437 --> 13:28.634
discerning a personal problem
here, gentlemen?

13:31.677 --> 13:33.235
Frankly, yes, Captain.

13:37.016 --> 13:38.449
Solve it.

13:38.517 --> 13:41.042
You leave at 1400 hours.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.462
We're modifying the transporter

13:57.536 --> 13:59.128
to try and penetrate
the atmosphere.

13:59.205 --> 14:01.002
So far no luck.

14:01.073 --> 14:02.631
However, we have been running

14:02.708 --> 14:04.141
computer simulations
to determine

14:04.210 --> 14:06.906
if the EM disturbances
follow any specific pattern.

14:06.979 --> 14:08.708
Our data analysis suggests that

14:08.781 --> 14:11.011
there may be occasional
atmospheric windows

14:11.083 --> 14:12.482
that would allow us
to get through.

14:12.551 --> 14:14.416
How occasional
and how long will they last?

14:14.486 --> 14:16.784
We should see one
every 30 hours or so,

14:16.856 --> 14:19.620
but they may only last
for a matter of minutes.

14:19.692 --> 14:20.886
I can't be sure yet.

14:20.960 --> 14:23.190
At least long enough for us
to beam up food supplies.

14:23.262 --> 14:24.923
Mr. Paris, you
and Mr. Neelix will collect

14:24.997 --> 14:26.760
as many vegetables
and fruits as you can

14:26.832 --> 14:29.392
while we wait for this
atmospheric window to open.

14:29.468 --> 14:32.562
Mr. Kim, be sure your computer
simulations include...

14:45.150 --> 14:46.583
What happened?

14:46.652 --> 14:47.584
I heard that you...

14:47.653 --> 14:48.585
Nothing happened.

14:48.654 --> 14:51.384
They said that you
and Tom Paris...

14:51.457 --> 14:55.086
Kes, we'll talk when I get back.

14:55.160 --> 14:56.752
I want to know.

14:56.829 --> 14:59.161
Neelix, is it true
that you were fighting?

14:59.231 --> 15:01.529
When I get back.

15:01.634 --> 15:02.566
But...

15:02.601 --> 15:03.568
Shuttlebay.

15:08.173 --> 15:09.640
Good afternoon.

15:09.708 --> 15:12.438
When you have a chance,
could you run an analysis

15:12.511 --> 15:14.604
of the cytokinetic results
for...

15:14.680 --> 15:15.772
I did it during lunch.

15:21.720 --> 15:22.709
Are you all right?

15:22.788 --> 15:23.846
I'm fine.

15:23.923 --> 15:24.890
Are you sure?

15:24.957 --> 15:26.788
-You seem a little...
-I'm fine.

15:27.860 --> 15:30.055
You know, if you skipped
lunch, the result

15:30.129 --> 15:31.824
might be a lower blood
sugar level, which could...

15:32.831 --> 15:34.856
I'm sorry.
It's in my program.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.767
I see something wrong,
I must attempt to diagnose it.

15:37.836 --> 15:39.394
There are some things
you can't cure.

15:43.509 --> 15:49.880
Neelix and Tom Paris had
a physical... fight.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.610
Over me.

15:51.684 --> 15:53.151
How delightful.

15:54.153 --> 15:55.711
Delightful?!

15:55.788 --> 15:58.222
You should consider it
a high compliment.

15:58.290 --> 16:01.782
Throughout history, men have
fought over the love of a woman.

16:01.860 --> 16:04.021
Why, I can quote you
autopsy reports

16:04.096 --> 16:06.064
from duels as far back as 1538.

16:06.131 --> 16:07.291
That's not funny.

16:07.366 --> 16:08.993
It's not meant to be.

16:09.068 --> 16:11.502
You've always been interested
in autopsies.

16:11.570 --> 16:13.765
Are all Talaxians so jealous?

16:13.839 --> 16:14.863
I wouldn't know.

16:14.940 --> 16:16.407
I've only met one.

16:16.475 --> 16:17.669
I love Neelix.

16:17.743 --> 16:19.404
Why can't he just accept that?

16:19.478 --> 16:22.811
His suspicions about Tom
are completely unjustified.

16:22.881 --> 16:24.280
Are they?

16:24.350 --> 16:27.183
Lieutenant Paris' affection
for you is obvious.

16:27.252 --> 16:28.514
What do you mean?

16:28.587 --> 16:31.886
I mean he... desires you.

16:31.957 --> 16:33.424
That's not true.

16:33.492 --> 16:35.050
Tom and I enjoy
each other's company.

16:35.127 --> 16:36.094
We're friends.

16:37.229 --> 16:39.026
Whenever you walk into the room,

16:39.098 --> 16:41.430
his respiration increases,
his pupils dilate

16:41.500 --> 16:44.333
and the coloration of his ears
turns decidedly orange.

16:44.403 --> 16:45.631
Until I noticed the pattern,

16:45.704 --> 16:47.262
I thought he was suffering
from Tanzian flu.

16:47.339 --> 16:49.739
It's there for anyone to see.

16:49.808 --> 16:51.969
Maybe not in the same diagnostic
detail as I see it,

16:52.077 --> 16:52.975
yet...

16:53.078 --> 16:54.978
Are you saying
that I didn't want to see it?

16:59.585 --> 17:01.849
You're only two years old.

17:01.954 --> 17:05.048
There may be a few things...

17:05.089 --> 17:08.252
you don't know
to look for in a man.

17:08.327 --> 17:10.659
In time, you'll understand.

17:10.729 --> 17:13.323
On my homeworld,
it's so much simpler.

17:13.398 --> 17:14.559
You choose a mate for life.

17:14.633 --> 17:19.093
There is no distrust, no
jealously, no envy, no betrayal.

17:19.171 --> 17:23.039
Hmm, your world must have
very dry literature.

17:24.510 --> 17:27.104
I don't know how to handle
something like this.

17:27.179 --> 17:29.943
What am I going to do?

17:32.484 --> 17:33.473
You've done nothing

17:33.552 --> 17:35.520
to precipitate
this state of affairs.

17:35.587 --> 17:39.250
You may not be able to do
much to resolve it either.

17:39.324 --> 17:43.192
There are some things
you can't cure.

17:55.574 --> 17:59.908
Entry sequence at two minutes.
Mark.

17:59.978 --> 18:01.605
All systems normal.

18:01.713 --> 18:05.979
Trigemic density
at .041 and rising.

18:06.018 --> 18:10.819
We lost communication
with Voyager 30 seconds ago.

18:10.889 --> 18:14.381
You don't have to impress
me with your technobabble.

18:14.460 --> 18:17.258
I'm not trying
to impress anyone.

18:17.329 --> 18:19.695
I'm entering it
into the flight record.

18:21.133 --> 18:22.964
Look, can I make a suggestion?

18:23.035 --> 18:25.162
You're the commander
of this mission.

18:25.237 --> 18:27.034
You can make
any suggestion you want.

18:27.106 --> 18:29.370
And if you make it an order,
I'll even have to obey it.

18:30.576 --> 18:33.545
My suggestion is that we put
our personal problems aside

18:33.612 --> 18:36.308
until this mission is over,
okay?

18:36.381 --> 18:38.349
I left my personal problems
back on the ship.

18:38.417 --> 18:39.884
I can't speak for you.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.112
Fine. Let's get the job done.

18:41.186 --> 18:43.848
You get us down in one piece
and I'll take it from there.

18:49.161 --> 18:52.528
Entry sequence
at three minutes. Mark.

18:52.598 --> 18:53.997
All systems...

18:55.801 --> 18:56.825
Stand by.

18:56.902 --> 18:59.894
Have you been briefed
on shuttle operations?

18:59.972 --> 19:02.133
Ensign Baytart took me
through the basics.

19:02.241 --> 19:03.833
Of course, I, I didn't have

19:03.942 --> 19:06.410
the benefit
of your personal tutelage.

19:06.478 --> 19:07.706
Check your console.

19:07.779 --> 19:09.440
I'm reading
a power-output decline

19:09.515 --> 19:12.313
of... 15 percent.

19:12.384 --> 19:14.545
Confirmed.

19:14.620 --> 19:17.680
Warning. Vectored exhaust
controls malfunctioning.

19:18.824 --> 19:20.291
What does that mean?

19:20.359 --> 19:22.054
We're getting
some kind of reaction

19:22.127 --> 19:23.458
in our driver coil assembly

19:23.529 --> 19:25.554
from the EM anomalies
in the atmosphere.

19:27.566 --> 19:30.057
I'm going to abort the mission.
Hold on.

19:35.140 --> 19:36.869
We've lost our impulse drive!

19:36.942 --> 19:38.910
Shut off the deuterium flow.

19:38.977 --> 19:40.877
I'm dumping excess fuel.

19:40.946 --> 19:42.413
Deuterium flow sealed.

19:42.481 --> 19:45.075
Setting DCA pulse order
to neutral.

19:45.150 --> 19:47.448
Engaging thrusters.

19:47.519 --> 19:49.146
Can you regain control?

19:49.221 --> 19:50.381
I'm trying, Neelix.

19:50.455 --> 19:52.446
Prepare
for an emergency landing.

19:52.524 --> 19:54.492
Send out an EMS pulse.

19:54.560 --> 19:57.028
There's still a chance
Voyager will pick it up.

20:00.732 --> 20:01.756
Captain, we're picking up

20:01.833 --> 20:03.232
a locator signal
from the shuttle.

20:03.302 --> 20:04.496
Can you track it?

20:04.570 --> 20:07.562
Their last velocity vector
indicates a steep descent.

20:07.639 --> 20:10.107
We've lost contact.

20:10.175 --> 20:11.142
Bridge to Torres.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.199
Torres here.

20:12.277 --> 20:13.767
B'Elanna,
our shuttle's in trouble.

20:13.845 --> 20:15.642
Any progress
on modifying the transporter?

20:17.316 --> 20:18.408
Negative.

20:18.483 --> 20:20.451
It's an extremely complex
interference pattern

20:20.519 --> 20:22.111
and it keeps changing.

20:22.187 --> 20:23.654
Bring in as much
help as you need.

20:23.722 --> 20:25.417
This is now a search
and rescue operation.

20:25.490 --> 20:27.117
Acknowledged.
Torres out.

20:27.192 --> 20:28.124
Keep me informed.

20:28.193 --> 20:29.160
I'll be in my ready room.

20:39.538 --> 20:41.802
I said...

20:41.873 --> 20:43.397
in one piece.

20:43.475 --> 20:44.840
Sorry.

20:44.910 --> 20:46.844
I did the best I could.

20:46.912 --> 20:48.777
Any broken bones?

20:50.415 --> 20:52.212
Everything seems to be working.

20:53.585 --> 20:54.847
I'm itching.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.581
I feel it, too.

20:56.655 --> 21:00.091
We've got atmospheric
leakage in the hull.

21:00.158 --> 21:03.184
The trigemic vapors
really sting.

21:03.262 --> 21:04.229
Here.

21:06.164 --> 21:07.893
Doc said
this would help a little.

21:09.101 --> 21:12.764
If we have atmospheric leakage,
how can we fly out of here?

21:12.838 --> 21:15.033
We can't. We'll have to wait
for Voyager to find us.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.802
We're not even sure
they're looking for us yet.

21:16.875 --> 21:18.934
We don't know
if the EMS pulse got through.

21:19.011 --> 21:20.706
B'Elanna's working
on the transporter

21:20.779 --> 21:23.839
and one of those atmospheric
windows might open up.

21:23.915 --> 21:24.939
In the meantime, we're going

21:25.017 --> 21:26.507
to have to look
for some kind of cover.

21:26.585 --> 21:28.644
I say we stay right here.

21:28.720 --> 21:30.551
The trigemic vapors
are going to...

21:30.622 --> 21:32.419
You're the one who wants
to go out into those vapors!

21:32.491 --> 21:34.857
Staying here is our best chance
of being found.

21:34.926 --> 21:36.188
You heard what they said.

21:36.261 --> 21:38.525
Those windows may only be open
for a matter of minutes.

21:38.597 --> 21:40.258
And we may be waiting here
for days.

21:40.332 --> 21:42.095
Exposure to these vapors
is too dangerous.

21:42.167 --> 21:43.498
We're leaving.
Grab your gear.

21:43.568 --> 21:45.695
Is that an order
or a suggestion?

21:45.771 --> 21:46.669
An order!

21:47.739 --> 21:49.070
Yes, sir.

21:51.510 --> 21:53.671
I hope you're satisfied.

21:53.745 --> 21:55.679
We were a lot more comfortable
inside the shuttle.

21:55.747 --> 21:58.045
I have red welts
all over my hands now.

21:58.150 --> 21:59.515
You know, it might be
more constructive

21:59.584 --> 22:01.415
if you could find us
something safe to eat.

22:01.520 --> 22:02.953
I certainly don't know

22:02.988 --> 22:05.456
why the ship's sensors
indicated this planet

22:05.524 --> 22:07.719
might be rich in food supplies.

22:07.793 --> 22:09.351
It sure doesn't look it.

22:09.428 --> 22:11.794
Our emergency rations
won't last forever.

22:11.863 --> 22:14.559
I'll find something for us.

22:14.633 --> 22:16.225
Of course, it might not meet

22:16.301 --> 22:18.269
your personal
culinary standards.

22:18.337 --> 22:19.668
Oh, don't worry.

22:19.738 --> 22:21.205
I've learned
to lower my standards

22:21.273 --> 22:22.604
since you became cook.

22:24.509 --> 22:26.977
I'm picking up some caves
about a kilometer west of here.

22:27.045 --> 22:29.240
What good fortune.

22:33.151 --> 22:34.743
Come in.

22:34.820 --> 22:36.549
Harry.

22:36.621 --> 22:37.952
Any word yet?

22:39.758 --> 22:42.090
We're doing everything possible.

22:42.160 --> 22:44.390
The transporter just
doesn't want to work

22:44.463 --> 22:45.487
in that atmosphere.

22:45.564 --> 22:46.724
How are you doing?

22:46.798 --> 22:49.028
Oh, I'm all right.

22:52.270 --> 22:54.170
It's just, uh...

22:55.407 --> 22:58.774
I was very angry at them
a few hours ago.

22:58.844 --> 23:00.778
You had every right to be.

23:00.879 --> 23:03.313
And now they might both be dead.

23:05.951 --> 23:09.148
And I'm sitting here...

23:09.221 --> 23:11.849
and I'm feeling guilty
for some reason.

23:11.923 --> 23:13.220
Guilty? Why?

23:13.291 --> 23:14.918
I don't know.

23:17.429 --> 23:19.897
But I don't like it.

23:19.965 --> 23:23.162
And it's their fault

23:23.235 --> 23:25.760
and I can't even tell them
how angry I am at them

23:25.837 --> 23:28.465
and I may never be able to tell
them how angry I am at them!

23:28.540 --> 23:29.598
So it doesn't matter, does it?

23:29.674 --> 23:30.766
Look, you know

23:30.842 --> 23:32.810
if there was any way
to land that shuttle,

23:32.878 --> 23:34.675
Tom Paris got it down.

23:36.415 --> 23:39.612
And no one has stronger
survival skills than Neelix.

23:39.684 --> 23:41.618
I'm sure they'll both be fine.

23:41.686 --> 23:43.449
Unless they kill each other.

23:45.223 --> 23:47.623
They're professionals.

23:47.692 --> 23:48.989
They better be all right,

23:49.060 --> 23:51.858
because when I see them, I'm
personally going to tell them

23:51.930 --> 23:54.296
that I never intend to speak
to either one of them again.

23:57.602 --> 23:59.968
Chakotay to crew.
Battle stations.

24:09.581 --> 24:11.048
This is good.

24:11.116 --> 24:12.879
We can last a while in here.

24:25.797 --> 24:27.287
That should do it.

24:28.300 --> 24:29.892
Garnesite.

24:31.903 --> 24:34.963
This will give us
a little heat at least.

24:43.081 --> 24:46.016
We better conserve
our beacon cells.

25:08.807 --> 25:10.866
So...

25:12.377 --> 25:17.007
what is Starfleet protocol
for situations like this?

25:17.082 --> 25:18.777
Oh, there's a whole course

25:18.850 --> 25:22.479
at the Academy full of all sorts
of survival strategies.

25:22.554 --> 25:24.454
I hope you had a passing grade.

25:24.523 --> 25:26.150
B-minus.

25:26.224 --> 25:28.385
That's not very encouraging.

25:28.460 --> 25:31.918
My father was teaching
the class that year.

25:32.864 --> 25:35.594
And he gave you a B-minus?

25:35.667 --> 25:38.261
I guess he didn't
play favorites, huh?

25:42.974 --> 25:45.534
What about Talaxian protocols?

25:46.845 --> 25:49.211
I wrote my own book.

25:49.281 --> 25:52.773
My life before Voyager was
no bed of Felaran rose petals.

25:53.885 --> 25:55.580
No, more like a bed of...

25:55.654 --> 25:57.451
What?

25:59.758 --> 26:00.747
Nothing.

26:00.859 --> 26:02.827
You were going
to say "junk" perhaps?

26:02.861 --> 26:05.329
Go ahead, say it... junk.

26:05.397 --> 26:07.331
I was a dealer in junk.

26:07.399 --> 26:08.559
Perhaps not worthy

26:08.633 --> 26:10.601
of a woman like Kes
in your opinion.

26:10.669 --> 26:12.136
Neelix, I didn't say that.

26:12.203 --> 26:13.135
I never even...

26:17.309 --> 26:19.072
Tell me something.

26:19.144 --> 26:22.113
In that Starfleet
survival course,

26:22.180 --> 26:26.514
did your father teach you
to check for life signs

26:26.585 --> 26:28.576
before you seal yourself
inside a cave?

26:28.653 --> 26:31.053
I checked for life signs.

26:31.122 --> 26:32.555
There weren't any.

26:32.624 --> 26:35.184
There are now.

26:36.861 --> 26:38.089
Hail them.

26:38.163 --> 26:39.790
They do not respond, Captain.

26:49.441 --> 26:51.341
They're powering down
their weapon systems.

26:51.409 --> 26:53.809
The vessel has taken up
a position directly beneath us.

26:53.878 --> 26:55.345
What do you make of it,
Lieutenant?

26:55.413 --> 26:57.973
They would seem to have adopted
a defensive posture, Captain.

26:58.049 --> 27:00.882
I agree, but defending what?
The planet?

27:00.952 --> 27:02.510
Or something on it.

27:09.327 --> 27:11.386
Whatever this life-form is...

27:11.463 --> 27:14.193
its vital signs
are awfully faint.

27:15.634 --> 27:19.161
In this atmosphere,
it could be dying of exposure.

27:19.237 --> 27:21.432
No, I don't think so.

27:21.506 --> 27:23.167
They're faint...

27:23.241 --> 27:24.708
but steady.

27:42.127 --> 27:45.324
I'd say it's becoming
more and more evident

27:45.397 --> 27:47.365
that we chose the wrong cave.

28:10.555 --> 28:13.524
This is where the life
signs are coming from.

28:15.026 --> 28:17.551
They're embryonic life-forms.

28:18.697 --> 28:21.666
These two are half formed.

28:21.733 --> 28:24.566
This one almost seems to be...

28:50.995 --> 28:54.158
The EM disturbance patterns
match the computer simulations.

28:54.232 --> 28:56.291
I'd say we'll get a shot
at an atmospheric window

28:56.367 --> 28:57.732
in about 53 minutes.

28:57.802 --> 28:59.565
Where does that leave us
with the transporter?

28:59.637 --> 29:02.731
Our range will still be limited,
but the transporter should work

29:02.841 --> 29:03.830
as long as we stay in an area

29:03.908 --> 29:05.341
with reduced
electromagnetic activity.

29:05.410 --> 29:06.342
The problem is, we don't

29:06.411 --> 29:07.571
know where our shuttle
went down.

29:07.645 --> 29:09.613
So there's no way
to know how close they'll be

29:09.681 --> 29:10.648
to the window when it opens.

29:10.715 --> 29:12.182
Recommendations?

29:12.250 --> 29:14.650
Take the ship through the window
into the atmosphere.

29:14.719 --> 29:16.346
The closer you can get us
to the surface,

29:16.421 --> 29:18.514
the better our chances
for a successful beam-out.

29:18.590 --> 29:19.579
Get on it.

29:19.657 --> 29:21.386
Are you going to be
able to warn us

29:21.459 --> 29:23.017
before the window closes again?

29:23.094 --> 29:24.026
I think so.

29:24.095 --> 29:25.687
Mr. Kim, that's not an answer
I can live with.

29:25.764 --> 29:27.356
I'll try to get you
a better one, Captain.

29:27.432 --> 29:30.162
Mr. Tuvok, we need you to find
a way to get us by that ship.

29:30.235 --> 29:32.396
I have anticipated
your request, Captain.

29:32.470 --> 29:34.529
Am I correct in the assumption
that you will want to use

29:34.606 --> 29:35.595
minimal force?

29:35.673 --> 29:36.867
Assumption confirmed.

29:37.008 --> 29:38.669
I cannot guarantee success.

29:38.743 --> 29:40.506
My evaluation
of their weapon systems

29:40.578 --> 29:41.909
suggests a capacity
equal to our own.

29:41.980 --> 29:42.912
However...

29:42.981 --> 29:44.073
You've come up

29:44.149 --> 29:46.083
with an ingenious plan
to neutralize them.

29:46.151 --> 29:47.709
I have.

29:47.786 --> 29:50.050
In my analysis
of our first encounter,

29:50.121 --> 29:51.418
I have detected
what I believe to be

29:51.489 --> 29:54.049
a vulnerability
in their shield configuration.

29:54.125 --> 29:56.150
There appears to be
a slight phase retraction

29:56.227 --> 29:57.558
when auxiliary power
is transferred

29:57.629 --> 29:59.358
to their aft weapon systems.

29:59.430 --> 30:02.058
A covariant phaser pulse
into their aft control systems

30:02.133 --> 30:04.260
might disable
their entire weapons array.

30:04.335 --> 30:07.930
That was my ingenious plan,
Commander.

30:08.039 --> 30:09.233
You are correct.

30:09.307 --> 30:10.274
Very well.

30:10.341 --> 30:11.330
Red Alert.

30:11.409 --> 30:12.376
Mr. Kim, set coordinates.

30:12.443 --> 30:13.933
Torres, speed at 2,000 kph.

30:14.012 --> 30:14.979
Aye, Captain.

30:15.046 --> 30:16.308
Chakotay, take the helm.

30:16.381 --> 30:17.507
Coordinates entered.

30:17.582 --> 30:20.244
Engage.

30:22.020 --> 30:24.147
This creature's going
to have the ability

30:24.222 --> 30:25.154
to stand upright.

30:25.223 --> 30:27.691
It has the skeletal system
of a humanoid.

30:27.759 --> 30:31.195
It's cold-blooded,
has reptilian epidermis.

30:31.262 --> 30:33.253
Its brain
is significantly larger

30:33.331 --> 30:35.322
than most reptilian species.

30:35.400 --> 30:36.332
I'd say we're dealing

30:36.401 --> 30:38.130
with a sentient
life-form here, Neelix.

30:38.203 --> 30:40.000
If this species is sentient,

30:40.071 --> 30:42.164
wouldn't that suggest

30:42.240 --> 30:44.674
that its parents might
return to care for it?

30:44.742 --> 30:46.642
It's hard to say.

30:46.711 --> 30:48.611
Most common reptiles
lay their eggs

30:48.680 --> 30:50.614
and never return
to protect them.

30:50.682 --> 30:52.013
I think we've established

30:52.083 --> 30:53.710
we're not dealing
with a common reptile.

30:53.785 --> 30:54.774
True.

30:54.853 --> 30:56.047
And if this thing does
have a mother,

30:56.120 --> 30:58.588
I'd say we don't want
to be around when she gets back.

30:58.656 --> 30:59.623
Come on.

30:59.691 --> 31:01.283
We can't just leave it here.

31:01.392 --> 31:02.450
We're not leaving it here.

31:02.493 --> 31:03.926
Its mother left it here.

31:04.028 --> 31:05.518
We just happened to wander in.

31:05.597 --> 31:07.531
But we blocked off the cave.

31:07.599 --> 31:09.260
The mother might have been
trapped outside.

31:09.334 --> 31:12.701
We'll leave the door open
for her when we go, okay?

31:12.770 --> 31:14.704
Look, it's not that simple.

31:16.007 --> 31:18.100
What if she can sense
we were here?

31:18.176 --> 31:19.939
She... she might
be able to smell

31:20.044 --> 31:22.171
that faux lime
aftershave of yours.

31:22.247 --> 31:24.545
I'm sure you realize

31:24.616 --> 31:26.447
many species won't return
to a nest

31:26.517 --> 31:28.144
after it's been tampered with.

31:28.219 --> 31:31.677
Well, there's not much we can
do about that now, is there?

31:31.756 --> 31:33.986
We should just leave all this
the way we found it.

31:34.058 --> 31:34.990
No.

31:35.093 --> 31:35.991
Neelix!

31:36.094 --> 31:37.994
This creature is
our responsibility.

31:38.062 --> 31:39.324
Ours?

31:39.397 --> 31:41.524
The moment we came in here,
it became our responsibility.

31:41.599 --> 31:43.624
And you expect to take care
of this thing until what?

31:43.701 --> 31:46.226
It graduates
from high school, college?

31:46.304 --> 31:48.135
And what if Mom
doesn't come back?

31:48.206 --> 31:50.174
Are you planning to bring
this with us back on the ship?

31:50.241 --> 31:53.404
Look, if she does return
and accepts the hatchling,

31:53.478 --> 31:54.877
it'll solve everything.

31:54.946 --> 31:57.574
We just have to wait
and see what she does.

31:57.649 --> 31:59.310
I don't know how it is
in your Quadrant,

31:59.384 --> 32:02.012
but in mine we don't
abandon a newborn...

32:03.121 --> 32:04.520
thing.

32:08.126 --> 32:09.753
Fine.

32:09.827 --> 32:11.590
Fine, you made your point.

32:13.765 --> 32:17.201
I officially designate you
its godfather.

32:19.037 --> 32:20.664
It stopped crying.

32:20.738 --> 32:21.796
It's shivering.

32:21.873 --> 32:24.341
That's normal... isn't it?

32:24.409 --> 32:28.402
I mean, newborn life-forms
do shiver, don't they?

32:28.479 --> 32:32.415
To be honest, I haven't
been around many newborns.

32:33.985 --> 32:35.452
Me neither.

32:44.295 --> 32:48.163
Oh... look at this, Paris.

32:49.167 --> 32:50.498
It stopped shivering.

32:59.344 --> 33:00.333
It's asleep.

33:03.815 --> 33:06.113
Forget what I said, Neelix.

33:06.184 --> 33:07.811
You're not its godfather.

33:07.885 --> 33:09.147
You're its godmother.

33:17.662 --> 33:19.357
The atmospheric window
is forming, Captain.

33:19.430 --> 33:21.022
30 degrees
off the predicted coordinates.

33:21.099 --> 33:22.930
How soon will we have
maximum aperture, Mr. Kim?

33:23.034 --> 33:24.092
Nine minutes.

33:24.168 --> 33:25.760
All right, Commander,
let's try to draw some fire

33:25.837 --> 33:26.929
from their aft weapon systems.

33:27.038 --> 33:28.369
Bring us within ten kilometers.

33:34.278 --> 33:35.643
Shields at 80 percent.

33:35.713 --> 33:38.546
Minor damage
to our port nacelle.

33:38.616 --> 33:39.981
Rerouting power
to lateral thrusters.

33:40.084 --> 33:41.244
Tuvok?

33:41.319 --> 33:43.310
So far, I'm not detecting
the same vulnerability

33:43.388 --> 33:44.616
in their shields this time,
Captain.

33:44.689 --> 33:46.782
We may have to resort
to additional force.

33:46.858 --> 33:48.189
Arm photons.

33:48.259 --> 33:49.191
Ready.

33:49.260 --> 33:50.192
Prepare to...

33:50.261 --> 33:51.193
Stand by, Captain.

33:51.262 --> 33:53.230
I'm detecting an opening.

33:59.737 --> 34:01.864
Direct hit to their
aft control systems.

34:01.973 --> 34:03.668
Their weapons are disabled.

34:03.741 --> 34:05.766
Commander, proceed
to Mr. Kim's coordinates.

34:05.843 --> 34:07.435
One-half impulse.

34:10.214 --> 34:12.808
Oh, come on.
Come on.

34:12.884 --> 34:15.909
Doesn't seem to care
for Starfleet rations.

34:16.020 --> 34:18.351
If I were in my kitchen,

34:18.422 --> 34:22.518
I could cook you up some
delightful leola root broth.

34:22.592 --> 34:23.889
Are you serious?

34:23.960 --> 34:27.054
Ugh, I hope I never
see another leola root,

34:27.130 --> 34:28.393
and you are certainly
not feeding

34:28.466 --> 34:30.866
any of that hideous
broth to my niece...

34:30.935 --> 34:33.529
or nephew...

34:33.603 --> 34:35.161
whatever it is.

34:38.676 --> 34:40.940
Its heartbeat is getting weaker.

34:41.012 --> 34:43.275
I don't like it.

34:43.347 --> 34:45.178
Come on, kid.

34:45.248 --> 34:46.876
You've got to eat something.

34:46.951 --> 34:51.320
It seems far more interested
in my jacket than your food.

34:55.092 --> 34:58.426
Neelix, it's not your jacket.

34:58.496 --> 35:01.260
It's the residue of the trigemic
vapors we walked through.

35:01.365 --> 35:02.889
Think about it.

35:02.934 --> 35:04.367
Voyager's sensors

35:04.535 --> 35:06.867
picked up high levels
of proteins and amino acids,

35:06.938 --> 35:08.462
which we assumed meant
this was a planet

35:08.539 --> 35:11.099
filled with vast supplies
of edible plant life.

35:11.175 --> 35:12.540
We were certainly
wrong about that.

35:12.610 --> 35:16.376
The residue is a concentration
of proteins and amino acids.

35:16.447 --> 35:19.382
The perfect source of nutrition
for the hatchling.

35:19.450 --> 35:22.044
The source we cut off
when we blocked the cave.

35:22.120 --> 35:25.146
Come on, we've got
some rocks to move.

35:27.825 --> 35:29.816
The atmospheric window
is at full aperture, Captain.

35:29.894 --> 35:31.327
We should have
at least 17 minutes

35:31.395 --> 35:32.521
before it starts to close.

35:32.597 --> 35:34.462
Captain, the alien vessel
is in pursuit.

35:34.532 --> 35:36.432
Are their weapon systems
back on line already?

35:36.501 --> 35:38.526
Negative.
They are still disabled.

35:38.603 --> 35:39.934
They couldn't be preparing
to ram us, could they?

35:40.004 --> 35:40.936
Hold your course.

35:41.005 --> 35:42.233
We need to get
through that window,

35:42.306 --> 35:43.933
but prepare to take
evasive action if necessary.

35:44.075 --> 35:45.042
Understood.

35:45.109 --> 35:47.703
Alien vessel closing
to 1,000 kilometers.

35:47.778 --> 35:49.439
Five hundred.

35:49.514 --> 35:51.607
Three hundred.

35:51.682 --> 35:52.614
It has passed us

35:52.683 --> 35:54.173
and is proceeding
toward the surface.

35:54.252 --> 35:55.651
Take us down, Commander.

36:07.365 --> 36:08.957
It's not breathing!

36:09.033 --> 36:10.500
I don't think it's breathing!

36:10.568 --> 36:13.537
Come on, suck in some of those

36:13.604 --> 36:14.536
hearty vapors.

36:15.740 --> 36:17.298
It's just too weak.

36:20.411 --> 36:23.278
There must be something in here
we can use to resuscitate it.

36:23.347 --> 36:25.542
Neelix, we did
the best we could.

36:25.616 --> 36:26.708
No!

36:26.784 --> 36:28.149
It's our fault, it's our fault.

36:28.219 --> 36:29.777
If we hadn't come...

36:29.854 --> 36:32.914
Here. Cordrazine.

36:32.990 --> 36:34.014
This is a stimulant.

36:34.091 --> 36:35.558
You can't pump it full of drugs

36:35.626 --> 36:37.423
without knowing
its body chemistry.

36:37.495 --> 36:39.122
So we should just let it die?

36:44.902 --> 36:46.836
Give me that.

36:48.806 --> 36:52.435
When I was a kid,
a baby bird fell out of a nest

36:52.510 --> 36:54.876
and landed on the windowsill
next to my bed.

36:54.946 --> 36:56.641
We had to feed it water
with an eyedropper

36:56.714 --> 36:58.341
to keep it alive.

36:58.416 --> 37:00.179
What are you doing?

37:00.284 --> 37:02.650
Filling the eyedropper.

37:02.687 --> 37:04.848
Can you hold its mouth open?

37:10.895 --> 37:12.328
Do it again.

37:12.396 --> 37:13.693
Again.

37:17.602 --> 37:18.864
It's working.

37:18.936 --> 37:20.062
It's working!

37:21.439 --> 37:23.407
Life signs are getting stronger.

37:23.474 --> 37:24.873
You did it!

37:24.976 --> 37:26.603
We did it.

37:26.677 --> 37:30.044
You know, I never would have
thought of that hypospray, if...

37:30.114 --> 37:31.877
The vapors.

37:31.949 --> 37:34.076
Who cares?

37:49.200 --> 37:51.065
Sensors are operating
as well as can be expected

37:51.135 --> 37:52.568
under these conditions.

37:52.637 --> 37:55.265
Either we're just not close
enough to where they landed

37:55.339 --> 37:57.807
to pick up their com signals,
or they never landed.

37:57.875 --> 38:00.105
Their shuttle might have
burned up in the atmosphere.

38:00.211 --> 38:01.678
I'm not willing
to concede that yet.

38:01.712 --> 38:02.679
Any sign of the alien ship?

38:02.747 --> 38:03.805
No, Captain.
We've lost them.

38:03.914 --> 38:06.212
Mr. Kim, how much longer before
that window starts to close?

38:06.284 --> 38:07.478
Nine minutes, 20 seconds.

38:07.551 --> 38:08.848
Chakotay, extend our
surveillance pattern.

38:08.953 --> 38:10.250
If we don't find them
in five minutes,

38:10.321 --> 38:11.310
we'll head back to the window.

38:11.389 --> 38:12.686
Aye, Captain.

38:27.938 --> 38:29.462
I'm sorry.

38:29.540 --> 38:30.905
Hmm?

38:35.146 --> 38:37.410
I feel I owe you an apology.

38:40.284 --> 38:42.115
No, you don't.

38:43.487 --> 38:46.786
I had no right to push
that pasta in your lap.

38:46.857 --> 38:51.055
Well... think of it this way.

38:51.128 --> 38:52.720
It saved me
from having to eat it.

38:52.797 --> 38:54.094
Nothing personal,

38:54.165 --> 38:57.191
but I just don't have an
affinity for hair in my food.

38:57.268 --> 39:00.169
I haven't been fair to you.

39:02.273 --> 39:06.369
You know, I hear people talking
about you in the Mess Hall.

39:07.578 --> 39:10.012
No kidding.

39:10.081 --> 39:12.311
What do they say?

39:12.383 --> 39:15.250
Oh, that you used to be a coward

39:15.319 --> 39:17.253
and couldn't be trusted.

39:18.889 --> 39:20.618
It's typical of Kes
that she would

39:20.691 --> 39:23.387
befriend someone like you...

39:23.461 --> 39:26.487
someone who really
needs a friend.

39:26.564 --> 39:30.330
And I guess I...
just got a little jealous.

39:30.401 --> 39:33.165
I got more
than a little jealous.

39:34.839 --> 39:36.397
I realize now I was wrong.

39:48.786 --> 39:50.344
Neelix, I told you the truth

39:50.421 --> 39:53.390
when I said that nothing
happened between me and Kes.

39:54.959 --> 39:56.551
I know.

39:56.627 --> 39:59.357
And I promise you,
nothing ever will,

39:59.430 --> 40:01.295
but...

40:03.334 --> 40:05.427
you weren't wrong about me.

40:06.537 --> 40:07.526
What do you mean?

40:09.140 --> 40:10.107
I...

40:13.077 --> 40:16.911
Well, I guess the only way
to say it is to say it.

40:16.981 --> 40:19.449
I am attracted to Kes.

40:20.851 --> 40:21.818
Oh?

40:21.886 --> 40:23.877
To be honest,
if you weren't around,

40:23.954 --> 40:25.854
I'd be knocking at her door.

40:25.923 --> 40:28.289
But I respect you, Neelix.

40:28.359 --> 40:30.827
And that's that.

40:33.697 --> 40:36.393
Everything you heard
those guys saying about me...

40:36.467 --> 40:39.231
well, it was true.

40:39.303 --> 40:41.999
But it's not who I am anymore.

40:42.072 --> 40:44.506
At least not who I want to be.

40:44.575 --> 40:49.603
This upside-down mission
to the wrong side of the galaxy

40:49.680 --> 40:52.308
is giving me a second chance

40:52.383 --> 40:55.113
and I don't intend to blow it.

40:56.620 --> 40:58.588
I see.

40:58.656 --> 41:02.217
Well, in a way,
I can't say I blame you.

41:03.694 --> 41:06.060
She is very attractive.

41:09.467 --> 41:12.595
She's devoted to you, you know?

41:12.670 --> 41:15.036
Well, I did save her life.

41:15.105 --> 41:17.164
I'm sure she's grateful.

41:17.241 --> 41:19.607
Oh, she's a lot
more than grateful.

41:19.677 --> 41:22.475
She loves you, Neelix.

41:22.546 --> 41:24.173
I wouldn't stand a chance.

41:24.248 --> 41:25.442
Nobody would.

41:26.684 --> 41:27.981
There are others?

41:28.052 --> 41:32.614
If you ever doubt yourself,
just look into her eyes.

41:32.690 --> 41:35.090
See the way she looks at you.

41:35.159 --> 41:37.855
You'll never doubt
yourself again.

41:39.463 --> 41:44.196
And as far as I'm concerned,
I'll just be her friend.

41:44.268 --> 41:47.760
I mean, if you don't mind.

41:48.806 --> 41:51.798
I don't pick Kes' friends
for her.

41:53.544 --> 41:55.409
Just my own.

41:59.517 --> 42:01.917
Voyager, this is Lieutenant
Tom Paris and Mr. Neelix.

42:02.019 --> 42:02.951
Do you read?

42:02.987 --> 42:03.919
We do, Mr. Paris.

42:03.988 --> 42:04.920
Are you all right?

42:04.989 --> 42:06.217
Aside from a nasty rash, yes.

42:06.290 --> 42:07.757
Have you encountered life-forms?

42:07.825 --> 42:08.917
Actually, yes.

42:09.026 --> 42:10.550
Are they hostile?

42:10.628 --> 42:12.061
No.

42:12.129 --> 42:14.427
Just... young.

42:14.498 --> 42:15.692
Young?

42:15.766 --> 42:16.926
Yes, we found a nest,

42:17.034 --> 42:19.025
and one
of the creatures hatched.

42:19.103 --> 42:20.331
Be aware, we encountered

42:20.404 --> 42:22.099
a hostile ship
of unknown origin,

42:22.172 --> 42:23.537
and we're showing that ship
on the surface

42:23.607 --> 42:25.131
approximately one kilometer
from your position.

42:25.209 --> 42:27.439
We're attempting to lock on
to you for transport.

42:27.511 --> 42:28.478
Stand by.

42:28.546 --> 42:29.535
We can't leave yet.

42:29.613 --> 42:30.580
What? Why?

42:30.648 --> 42:32.616
What if the mother rejects it?

42:32.683 --> 42:34.514
Neelix, one thing's for sure...

42:34.585 --> 42:36.212
whether the mother
rejects it or not,

42:36.287 --> 42:37.720
she will reject you and me.

42:37.788 --> 42:40.279
We promised each other
we wouldn't abandon it until...

42:42.326 --> 42:44.191
Away team, we're showing
a life-form moving

42:44.261 --> 42:45.193
toward your position.

42:45.262 --> 42:46.194
Prepare to transport.

42:46.263 --> 42:47.696
Captain, this is Neelix.

42:47.765 --> 42:49.995
Are you in a particular
rush to leave?

42:50.067 --> 42:51.694
Did you hear what I just said,
Mr. Neelix?

42:51.769 --> 42:53.134
Yes, but, uh...

42:53.203 --> 42:54.727
we're not quite
finished here yet.

42:54.805 --> 42:55.737
Finished with what?

42:55.806 --> 42:56.898
We have an atmospheric window

42:56.974 --> 42:58.202
closing
in less than six minutes.

42:58.275 --> 42:59.867
And another one
will be coming in how long?

42:59.944 --> 43:00.842
Days.

43:00.945 --> 43:01.877
Is there a problem?

43:01.912 --> 43:03.573
The problem is, Captain,

43:03.647 --> 43:05.274
if we leave
our little hatchling here

43:05.349 --> 43:06.475
and the mother rejects it,

43:06.550 --> 43:08.814
it might die of exposure
before we get back.

43:08.886 --> 43:10.148
I appreciate your concern

43:10.220 --> 43:11.152
for its welfare...

43:11.221 --> 43:12.245
How long can you give us,
Captain?

43:14.191 --> 43:15.852
One minute, ten seconds, max.

43:15.926 --> 43:16.893
We'll take it!

43:16.961 --> 43:17.928
Lock on to us, Voyager.

43:17.995 --> 43:19.656
If you hear muffled screams,

43:19.730 --> 43:21.925
consider that a request
for a beam-out.

43:51.328 --> 43:53.159
There's nothing
like a family reunion.

43:54.665 --> 43:56.155
Voyager, two to beam out!

43:58.035 --> 43:59.468
As soon as you're ready.

44:06.076 --> 44:07.373
Kes!

44:07.444 --> 44:09.378
We didn't know if you
were dead or alive.

44:09.446 --> 44:10.413
What happened?

44:12.750 --> 44:14.217
I became an uncle.

44:14.284 --> 44:16.047
And I'm a godmother.

44:18.856 --> 44:21.916
I'd say this is
the special occasion

44:21.992 --> 44:24.620
I've been waiting for
to open up that bottle

44:24.695 --> 44:27.391
of Potak cold fowl
I've been saving.

44:27.464 --> 44:28.795
Cold fowl in a bottle?

44:28.866 --> 44:30.800
That's just an expression,
isn't it?

44:30.868 --> 44:33.234
No. It's actually made
from the glandular secretions

44:33.303 --> 44:36.397
of an adult dunghill bird
found only on Potak III.

44:36.473 --> 44:40.705
It's very rare, very exquisite.

44:40.778 --> 44:42.803
There are, I believe

44:42.880 --> 44:45.849
only 27 bottles
in existence at this time.

44:45.916 --> 44:47.816
It has a rather smoky flavor,

44:47.885 --> 44:50.683
uh... going well
with strong meaty dishes,

44:50.754 --> 44:53.279
but I prefer it for sipping...
