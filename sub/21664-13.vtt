00:05.922 --> 00:07.222
- Where are you going?

00:07.322 --> 00:08.755
Hang on a sec.

00:08.855 --> 00:10.255
Stop!

00:10.355 --> 00:11.822
Halt!

00:11.922 --> 00:12.822
I'm good at computers.

00:12.922 --> 00:14.155
Control alt delete!

00:14.255 --> 00:18.122
No. Button, but...

00:20.088 --> 00:22.455
- I can't believe I didn't
figure it out before.

00:22.555 --> 00:23.822
It all makes sense.

00:23.922 --> 00:26.822
Frankie's a robot.

00:26.922 --> 00:28.322
- I'll go get Ms. Hough.

00:28.422 --> 00:30.388
Tell her to bring
a cat, maybe two.

00:30.488 --> 00:32.922
Tammy's gone way over the edge
this time.

00:33.022 --> 00:34.888
- I have not!

00:38.788 --> 00:41.088
- Um, why do the Betas look like
they're playing rugby?

00:41.188 --> 00:42.922
- Ha, uh, rugby.

00:43.022 --> 00:44.222
Good one, Mr. K.

00:44.322 --> 00:46.122
- They're all trying to obey
the same command.

00:46.222 --> 00:49.155
To come to a precise point
in the center of this room.

00:49.255 --> 00:50.222
- Interesting.

00:50.322 --> 00:51.588
So when the stolen android
arrives...

00:51.688 --> 00:53.255
- It'll do the same thing.

00:53.355 --> 00:54.422
It's headed here now.

00:54.522 --> 00:55.888
- Good.

00:55.988 --> 00:56.922
- Yes, good.

00:57.022 --> 00:58.522
Great. Excellent.

00:58.622 --> 01:00.555
Should I contact Warpa
and schedule a pickup?

01:00.655 --> 01:02.855
Yes, do that.

01:02.955 --> 01:04.555
- Warpa.
- No, hold that call.

01:04.655 --> 01:05.988
- Putting you on hold.

01:06.088 --> 01:07.155
Is there a problem, sir?

01:07.255 --> 01:08.522
- Let's not schedule anything

01:08.622 --> 01:10.522
until we actually have
the android on the premises,

01:10.588 --> 01:11.922
and I've had a chance
to examine it.

01:12.022 --> 01:13.988
We may need to make
some modifications.

01:14.088 --> 01:15.255
- What should I tell Warpa?

01:15.355 --> 01:17.222
- I don't know,
just make something up.

01:17.322 --> 01:19.288
- Hello?
Sorry, butt dial.

01:19.388 --> 01:21.955
- Butt... you don't
even have a butt.

01:22.055 --> 01:23.222
Never mind.

01:23.322 --> 01:25.588
What is the current location
of the stolen android?

01:25.688 --> 01:26.988
- We don't know, sir.

01:27.088 --> 01:29.655
Dr. Gaines locked us out
of the android's GPS functions.

01:29.755 --> 01:31.722
- Do you have any idea
when it will get here?

01:31.822 --> 01:33.522
- Without its location
and rate of speed,

01:33.555 --> 01:35.988
we can't calculate an ETA.

01:37.822 --> 01:40.288
- Then you press B to get her
to jump and grab the gumdrops.

01:43.255 --> 01:44.922
- What if I
don't like gumdrops?

01:45.022 --> 01:46.922
Here, I'll just grab
this jellybean instead.

01:47.022 --> 01:49.188
Wait, no, that's...

01:49.288 --> 01:51.522
- Uh.
-... jellybean of doom.

01:51.622 --> 01:53.622
Let's play again.

01:53.722 --> 01:55.988
Wait, hang on.

01:56.088 --> 01:56.955
Hello?

01:57.055 --> 01:58.388
- Dr. Gaines,
it's Dayton Reyes.

01:58.522 --> 01:59.522
There's something wrong
with Frankie.

01:59.622 --> 02:00.588
She's just walking.

02:00.688 --> 02:02.122
- What do you mean?

02:02.222 --> 02:03.388
Just walking to where?

02:03.522 --> 02:05.422
- I don't know.
She won't talk to me.

02:05.522 --> 02:07.588
It's like she's being
controlled by somebody.

02:11.055 --> 02:12.922
- Uh, that's weird,
I can't call up her controller.

02:13.022 --> 02:13.922
Where are you?

02:14.022 --> 02:15.122
- The supermarket.

02:15.222 --> 02:16.222
Food Stuff and Such.

02:21.188 --> 02:22.288
- Sorry!

02:22.388 --> 02:24.822
It's not her fault.
She's sleepwalking.

02:24.922 --> 02:26.722
It's dangerous to wake her.

02:26.822 --> 02:28.188
You need to get down here.

02:28.288 --> 02:30.355
- On my way.

02:30.522 --> 02:31.522
I have to go.

02:31.555 --> 02:32.755
There's something wrong
with Frankie.

02:32.855 --> 02:34.922
- So what else is new?
- Serious.

02:35.022 --> 02:37.055
- Alright, then
I'm coming with you.

02:39.000 --> 02:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:57.088 --> 02:58.155
- Frankie!

02:58.255 --> 02:59.522
Sorry!

02:59.588 --> 03:02.155
Frankie!

03:02.255 --> 03:04.055
Bob, where you are?

03:04.155 --> 03:05.288
Here, Bob?

03:05.388 --> 03:06.288
Come here, boy?

03:06.388 --> 03:07.788
- Bob's not a dog, you know?

03:07.888 --> 03:10.555
He's one of the most
advanced robots you can build...

03:10.655 --> 03:12.622
for under $50.

03:12.722 --> 03:14.188
- Sorry, my head's
not in the game.

03:14.288 --> 03:15.522
- Thinking about Frankie?

03:15.622 --> 03:17.655
- I think I might have
come down a little hard

03:17.755 --> 03:19.355
on her about
the whole Andrew thing.

03:19.522 --> 03:20.955
- Right. I mean,
she obviously

03:21.055 --> 03:22.555
wants to go
to the dance with you.

03:22.655 --> 03:23.655
Why else would she have asked?

03:23.755 --> 03:26.822
- I should call her,
tell her I'm sorry.

03:30.522 --> 03:31.755
- Don't you wanna
see who that is?

03:31.855 --> 03:34.555
It could be your mom
or Cole

03:34.655 --> 03:38.755
or HOT 109.5 calling to say
you won a trip to Maui!

03:38.855 --> 03:40.522
No, no.

03:46.755 --> 03:49.822
- Come on, Frankie,
you gotta stop.

03:49.922 --> 03:50.955
I mean it!

03:51.055 --> 03:52.388
Got to stop!

03:52.522 --> 03:53.855
I mean it!

03:53.955 --> 03:55.088
Ah!

04:00.988 --> 04:04.388
- Uh, gross.

04:04.522 --> 04:06.288
At least it's strawberry.

04:09.588 --> 04:10.522
- Frankie!

04:10.555 --> 04:11.588
- Voicemail.

04:11.688 --> 04:12.855
Hello,
this is Frankie Gaines,

04:12.955 --> 04:14.155
please leave a message
after the tone.

04:14.255 --> 04:16.522
- Hey, me, it's Frankie.
Hey, Frankie, it's me, Cole.

04:16.588 --> 04:17.755
Cole Reyes, not coleslaw.

04:19.588 --> 04:22.055
Right, well, I'm really sorry.

04:22.155 --> 04:23.722
I shouldn't have given you
such a hard time.

04:23.822 --> 04:25.322
Uh, call me back.

04:25.422 --> 04:26.288
Oh, it's Cole.

04:26.388 --> 04:28.088
Cole Reyes.

04:28.188 --> 04:29.555
- Wow, smooth.

04:29.655 --> 04:32.322
- Oh, Byron, quick,
how do I do a do-over?

04:32.422 --> 04:34.022
- A what?
- A do-over. On voicemail.

04:34.122 --> 04:36.522
Isn't there a way I can delete
the message and record it again?

04:36.588 --> 04:37.588
- Oh, yeah, of course.

04:37.688 --> 04:39.055
- Well, what is it?
- That depends.

04:39.155 --> 04:40.188
Who's Frankie's
service provider?

04:40.288 --> 04:41.222
- How should I know?

04:41.322 --> 04:42.655
- Well, different
cellphone providers

04:42.755 --> 04:44.088
use different key combinations.

04:44.188 --> 04:45.655
You don't know
which one she uses,

04:45.755 --> 04:48.955
you might as well
just... hit random keys.

04:50.055 --> 04:52.522
- Oooh, oh, I think I did it.

04:52.622 --> 04:54.422
Your message
has been sent.

05:12.322 --> 05:13.522
- Frankie!

05:13.622 --> 05:15.322
Frankie, what's going on?
Talk to me.

05:15.422 --> 05:17.355
- What's wrong with her, Mom?
- I don't know.

05:17.522 --> 05:18.355
Did anything happen at school?

05:18.522 --> 05:19.688
- Not really.

05:19.788 --> 05:21.622
Could the E Stomach
have anything to do with this?

05:21.722 --> 05:24.788
- Could be, but we won't
find out until she stops.

05:28.255 --> 05:31.155
- She really wants
to go that way.

05:31.255 --> 05:32.788
Nothing will stop her.

05:35.022 --> 05:36.155
- Okay.

05:39.622 --> 05:41.522
This is your school.

05:41.555 --> 05:43.188
And this is our location.

05:43.288 --> 05:45.522
If Frankie keeps on walking
in that direction...

05:45.622 --> 05:46.822
- What's EGG?

05:46.922 --> 05:48.288
- Electronic Giga Genetics.

05:48.388 --> 05:49.755
I used to work there.

05:49.855 --> 05:52.522
It's where I made Frankie... they
must have cracked Droid Sync.

05:52.588 --> 05:53.922
Everybody in.

05:56.522 --> 05:57.922
- Okay, here you go.

06:01.288 --> 06:02.855
- There's only one way
to stop them.

06:02.955 --> 06:05.288
I need to get into EGG servicer
and disable Droid Sync.

06:05.388 --> 06:07.788
- We're too far away
to get access to their network.

06:07.888 --> 06:10.522
Go closer.
- EGG has cameras everywhere.

06:10.588 --> 06:11.822
They'll see us and shut us down.

06:11.922 --> 06:14.155
Open the glovebox.
There's a signal booster.

06:15.588 --> 06:17.555
- Okay.

06:17.655 --> 06:19.722
- We're running out of time.

06:19.822 --> 06:21.088
I can't connect.

06:21.188 --> 06:23.788
- What are we gonna do?
- We can't just give up!

06:25.788 --> 06:27.255
Look for some foil, quick!

06:27.355 --> 06:29.422
- If you're thinking
of wrapping that up for later,

06:29.522 --> 06:31.422
I wouldn't... ew!

06:31.522 --> 06:32.522
- Found some.

06:32.555 --> 06:33.822
- Double ew.

06:33.922 --> 06:36.522
- A parabola can extend
the range of your antennae

06:36.555 --> 06:40.555
by 400 to 800%.

06:40.655 --> 06:42.788
Here.

06:42.888 --> 06:45.788
Stick... the antennae
through there,

06:45.888 --> 06:47.088
and then hold it out the window.

06:47.188 --> 06:50.688
- Jenny... now this is all you.

06:50.788 --> 06:51.988
- You got this.

06:52.088 --> 06:53.888
- Point it at the middle
of that main building.

06:53.988 --> 06:55.388
It's the WIFI access point.

06:55.522 --> 06:56.822
Uh, a little to the right.

06:56.922 --> 06:58.755
A little more... uh, right there,
I'm connected.

06:58.855 --> 07:00.788
Dayton, you're a genius.
- Yah!

07:00.888 --> 07:02.655
- What are you gonna do?
- Disable Droid Sync.

07:02.755 --> 07:03.955
I built a backdoor
to the program

07:04.055 --> 07:05.522
in case something like this
ever happened again.

07:05.622 --> 07:07.322
- What do you mean
happened again?

07:11.822 --> 07:13.955
- Ow!
- Sorry, sir.

07:14.055 --> 07:17.422
- I am in no mood today, PEGS1.

07:17.522 --> 07:18.988
- Ow!

07:19.088 --> 07:22.722
- You are going in here.
I am in no mood.

07:22.822 --> 07:24.622
You know I don't like
confined spaces.

07:24.722 --> 07:26.388
It's bad for my complexion.

07:32.788 --> 07:34.655
- The android, I see it.

07:36.922 --> 07:38.722
♪ Oh, the android is mine

07:38.822 --> 07:40.088
♪ The android

07:40.188 --> 07:41.988
Congratulations, sir,
on both your success

07:42.088 --> 07:44.388
and your unparalleled
rhyming skills.

07:44.522 --> 07:45.522
Ow!

07:47.688 --> 07:48.822
- Uh-oh!

07:50.888 --> 07:52.055
- Someone's broken in
through a backdoor

07:52.155 --> 07:53.755
and is trying to disable
Droid Sync.

07:53.855 --> 07:55.355
- Gaines, it must be.

07:55.522 --> 07:56.522
Get rid of her!

08:00.522 --> 08:01.222
- Hurry, mom!

08:01.322 --> 08:02.855
- I'm going as fast as I can.

08:02.955 --> 08:05.355
No, they closed the door.

08:05.522 --> 08:06.288
They must be onto me.

08:06.388 --> 08:07.588
- No!

08:07.688 --> 08:10.255
- Don't worry, the old girl
still knows a few tricks.

08:12.922 --> 08:17.122
- Oh, you're good, Dr. Gaines,
but I'm better.

08:17.222 --> 08:19.655
- Come on, Anderson,
kick her out of Droid Sync.

08:19.755 --> 08:20.888
What's going on?

08:20.988 --> 08:22.688
Let me out!

08:22.788 --> 08:26.255
I've got FOMO,
and I've got it bad.

08:26.355 --> 08:28.188
- Ha!

08:28.288 --> 08:31.322
Checkmate!

08:31.422 --> 08:33.522
- Uh, no.

08:33.554 --> 08:35.121
Come on.

08:35.222 --> 08:37.054
Stand down, let her pass.

08:56.088 --> 08:56.988
- We're losing her!

08:57.088 --> 08:57.955
- I know, I know.

08:58.055 --> 08:59.221
I just need to...

09:00.821 --> 09:01.888
What was that?

09:01.988 --> 09:03.821
It sounds like
a wrestling match. I'm ready.

09:03.921 --> 09:06.321
Let me out, and tag me in, sir.

09:09.755 --> 09:10.655
- Yes!

09:10.755 --> 09:11.688
- Yeah!

09:11.788 --> 09:13.655
- Frankie, over here!

09:19.721 --> 09:20.855
- Get in!

09:20.955 --> 09:22.188
Quick! Everybody in?

09:22.288 --> 09:23.821
- Okay!
- Drive!

09:23.921 --> 09:26.555
- Oh, no, no, no,
the android is getting away.

09:26.655 --> 09:27.788
Do something.

09:27.888 --> 09:29.121
- The whole system is fried.

09:29.221 --> 09:31.021
- What?

09:31.121 --> 09:31.988
Security!

09:32.088 --> 09:34.888
Secur... perfect.

09:34.988 --> 09:38.555
You have got to be kidding me.

09:38.655 --> 09:40.888
- Will, that's the tenth time
you've hugged her.

09:40.988 --> 09:43.221
- I'm just so glad she's safe.

09:43.321 --> 09:44.488
One more extra strong.

09:44.655 --> 09:45.388
Ugh!

09:45.488 --> 09:46.555
I meant me, not you.

09:46.655 --> 09:50.388
- Okay, let's get Frankie
recharged.

09:50.488 --> 09:52.255
- Mom, why did EGG take me?

09:52.355 --> 09:54.155
- They think I stole you.

09:54.255 --> 09:55.588
They consider you
their property.

09:55.688 --> 09:57.088
- Do you think of me
as property?

09:57.188 --> 09:58.321
- Oh, no way.

09:58.421 --> 10:01.955
You are family,
just like Dad and Jenny.

10:02.055 --> 10:03.321
- I am not like Dad and Jenny.

10:03.421 --> 10:04.355
Dad is your husband.

10:04.455 --> 10:05.655
Jenny is an offspring.

10:05.755 --> 10:07.688
She shares your DNA.

10:07.788 --> 10:09.221
I don't even have DNA.

10:09.321 --> 10:12.621
- Frankie, families can mean
many different things.

10:12.721 --> 10:15.421
We don't need to be
bound together by our DNA.

10:15.521 --> 10:17.855
We are bound together by love.

10:17.955 --> 10:19.188
Do you understand?

10:19.288 --> 10:21.055
- I think I do, Mom.

10:21.155 --> 10:22.755
Do you think EGG
will try to take me again?

10:22.855 --> 10:25.121
- I don't know.
But I'm not going to let them.

10:25.221 --> 10:26.455
- They were controlling me.

10:26.555 --> 10:29.021
I had no ability to do anything
but what they commanded.

10:29.121 --> 10:30.488
I don't like that.

10:30.588 --> 10:31.788
- I can see why you wouldn't.

10:31.888 --> 10:33.755
- I must prevent anyone
from controlling me.

10:33.855 --> 10:36.088
I will control myself,
and do what I want to do.

10:36.188 --> 10:39.655
- That's my girl.

10:40.888 --> 10:43.521
- Now, relax, recharge.

10:43.621 --> 10:45.488
Mwah.
Good night, Frankie.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.221
- You didn't want
to tell her about Warpa?

10:57.321 --> 10:58.955
- I didn't want
to put that on her.

10:59.055 --> 11:00.688
She was upset enough about EGG.

11:00.788 --> 11:03.655
Imagine if she knew Kingston
planned to turn her over

11:03.721 --> 11:06.488
to a covert agency
who's going to weaponize her

11:06.655 --> 11:09.221
and use her
to overthrow the government.

11:09.321 --> 11:10.755
- You're right,
she wouldn't take that well.

11:10.855 --> 11:12.521
- This is serious, Will.

11:12.655 --> 11:14.655
We can't let them turn
our daughter into a weapon.

11:14.755 --> 11:17.355
We have to make sure
they never find her.

11:17.455 --> 11:20.555
That means her secret
needs to stay a secret.

11:24.488 --> 11:26.921
She is a robot.

11:27.021 --> 11:28.388
It all makes sense.

11:28.488 --> 11:31.755
How she talks, how she knows
everything about everything.

11:31.855 --> 11:35.121
How she walked out of school
today like... like a robot.

11:35.221 --> 11:36.488
Oh, excuse me, garçon.

11:36.655 --> 11:38.688
Another round of waters,
s'il vous plait.

11:38.788 --> 11:40.655
- We're closed.

11:43.121 --> 11:44.355
- Robots have gotten
pretty advanced,

11:44.455 --> 11:46.155
don't you think we'd know
if they made one

11:46.255 --> 11:47.721
that could pass
for a high school student?

11:47.821 --> 11:49.421
- We'd have definitely
read about it.

11:49.521 --> 11:50.688
- Read about it where?

11:50.788 --> 11:51.755
- Robot magazines.

11:51.855 --> 11:53.921
I subscribe
to "Robots Illustrated,"

11:54.021 --> 11:55.255
"Robot Digest"...

11:55.355 --> 11:56.988
- I get "Robopolitan," and
"Martha Stewart's Robots"...

11:57.088 --> 11:58.055
- You're being naïve.

11:58.155 --> 11:59.255
Don't you get it?

11:59.355 --> 12:01.755
She must be a prototype
they're testing out.

12:01.855 --> 12:04.088
And this Frankie bot
just flunked.

12:04.188 --> 12:07.121
Get it?

12:07.221 --> 12:10.188
Frankie flunked the test.

12:10.288 --> 12:11.721
- Why'd she repeat
what she just said?

12:11.821 --> 12:15.421
- Okay, the point is,
what to do about it?

12:15.521 --> 12:17.221
- Ooh, I know.

12:17.321 --> 12:19.255
We don't do anything.

12:19.355 --> 12:21.288
We mind our own business.

12:21.388 --> 12:23.355
- And by we, she means you.

12:23.455 --> 12:25.188
- Uuuh, wrong.

12:25.288 --> 12:26.721
We expose her.

12:26.821 --> 12:31.455
- Just for argument sake, say
you're right and she is a robot?

12:31.555 --> 12:32.855
- Which we don't believe.

12:32.955 --> 12:35.155
- That's why I said
"for argument sake."

12:35.255 --> 12:37.855
- I just wanted
to underscore the point.

12:37.955 --> 12:41.321
- What would exposing
Frankie accomplish?

12:41.421 --> 12:43.721
- Must I spell
everything out to you?

12:43.821 --> 12:48.088
If she's a robot, then I'm still
the smartest person in school.

12:54.655 --> 12:56.188
- She hasn't told Andrew yet?

12:56.288 --> 12:58.255
- Don't worry,
she's going with you.

12:58.355 --> 12:59.488
She asked you, didn't she?

12:59.655 --> 13:01.555
- Then what is she waiting for?

13:01.655 --> 13:04.021
- She's just... been busy.

13:04.121 --> 13:06.455
She's got a lot on her plate.

13:06.555 --> 13:08.221
- By the way,
where did you guys go

13:08.321 --> 13:10.421
when she blazed
out of school yesterday?

13:10.521 --> 13:13.921
- Um, we went,
um... sightseeing.

13:14.021 --> 13:15.321
Yeah.

13:15.421 --> 13:21.188
'Cause she's still new here,
so she dragged me all over town.

13:21.288 --> 13:23.155
Oh look, there's Byron!

13:25.121 --> 13:26.755
Bob still hasn't turned up?

13:26.855 --> 13:28.021
He will.

13:28.121 --> 13:31.288
And if he doesn't,
you made him from a kit, right?

13:31.388 --> 13:34.721
Couldn't you just...

13:34.821 --> 13:37.655
He'll turn up.
I know he will.

13:40.388 --> 13:41.688
- EGG was trying
to take me back

13:41.788 --> 13:43.421
because they think
I belong to them.

13:43.521 --> 13:45.655
Like I'm a phone or a backpack.

13:45.688 --> 13:49.655
- Wow, that EGG place
is only one town over.

13:49.721 --> 13:51.321
You're my best friend
and everything,

13:51.421 --> 13:53.521
but maybe it's too dangerous
for you here.

13:53.655 --> 13:55.421
- Mom says we're hiding
in plain sight.

13:55.521 --> 13:56.988
Avoiding detection
by being in a place

13:57.088 --> 13:59.155
your pursuer dismisses
as too obvious to consider.

13:59.255 --> 14:01.955
- But now this Kingston jerk
knows you're close

14:02.055 --> 14:05.421
and not like
in Tasmania or Siberia.

14:05.521 --> 14:07.455
We need a plan.
- I have a plan.

14:07.555 --> 14:08.688
To become a human girl.

14:08.788 --> 14:10.255
That way I'll be useless
to someone

14:10.355 --> 14:11.921
who wants a mindless robot.

14:12.021 --> 14:14.388
But I'd better hurry up.

14:23.188 --> 14:25.555
- You've got to tell him you're
going to the dance with Cole.

14:25.655 --> 14:27.088
- Andrew's downcast eyes
and mouth shape

14:27.188 --> 14:28.421
suggests that he's sad today.

14:28.521 --> 14:29.988
- Well, yeah,
because he knows you're gonna

14:30.088 --> 14:32.388
break your date with him.

14:32.488 --> 14:35.421
Come on, Frankie,
you asked Cole out,

14:35.521 --> 14:37.821
so obviously you want
to go with him.

14:37.921 --> 14:39.755
- It is strange,
but I do experience

14:39.855 --> 14:41.855
an unusual sensation
around Andrew,

14:41.955 --> 14:42.821
like a connection.

14:42.921 --> 14:43.921
- No!

14:44.021 --> 14:45.921
You like Cole, remember?

14:46.021 --> 14:47.921
You like like him.

14:48.021 --> 14:49.321
- I know.

14:49.421 --> 14:50.688
But I don't know what to do.

14:50.788 --> 14:52.455
Are you sure
I can't have two dates?

14:52.555 --> 14:55.455
- This isn't a TV sitcom,
you need to decide.

14:59.721 --> 15:01.321
- There is
no satisfactory solution.

15:01.421 --> 15:02.855
- It's part of being human.

15:02.955 --> 15:04.921
Sometimes you have
to make hard choices.

15:05.021 --> 15:07.521
- My circuits are designed
for binary decision-making.

15:07.655 --> 15:09.955
There must be
a right and wrong answer.

15:15.255 --> 15:16.988
- Frankie, are you okay?

15:24.055 --> 15:26.221
- What's wrong?
Is it Droid Sync?

15:30.265 --> 15:31.665
- That doesn't
look like Droid Sync.

15:31.765 --> 15:33.732
Are you paralyzed
by the decision?

15:33.832 --> 15:36.099
What if you flip a coin?

15:38.432 --> 15:40.499
Hello, Tammy Gilroy.

15:40.599 --> 15:44.265
- Hello, Frankie... whatever
your last name is.

15:46.981 --> 15:47.981
- Thank you, Dayton Reyes.

15:48.081 --> 15:49.681
- It's what I'm here for.

15:49.815 --> 15:50.848
Come on, it's lunchtime.

15:50.948 --> 15:52.381
- Yeah, lunch!

15:53.881 --> 15:54.981
- I just saw Frankie.

15:55.081 --> 15:56.481
I know I'm right about her.

15:56.581 --> 15:58.681
She was acting all...

15:58.815 --> 15:59.815
- Like a statue?

15:59.848 --> 16:01.348
A tree? A mime?

16:01.448 --> 16:02.481
- Roboty.

16:02.581 --> 16:04.815
- She looks okay to me.

16:04.848 --> 16:07.348
- Come on, who comes
to a lunchroom every day

16:07.448 --> 16:10.815
and never touches food?

16:10.848 --> 16:13.248
- You were saying?

16:13.348 --> 16:15.815
- So? It doesn't prove
she's human.

16:15.915 --> 16:17.815
- So what's the treatment
for delusional disorder?

16:17.881 --> 16:19.115
- There's been
growing literature

16:19.215 --> 16:21.848
on the effectiveness of
cognitive behavioral therapy.

16:21.948 --> 16:24.148
- Interesting.

16:24.248 --> 16:27.515
- Slow down there, girl, you're
still new at this eating thing.

16:27.615 --> 16:30.181
I don't know how much
your E Stomach can take.

16:30.281 --> 16:32.415
- A randomized decision maker
would be a truly fair way

16:32.515 --> 16:34.948
to decide who to go
to the dance with....

16:35.048 --> 16:37.215
- Whoa, you okay?

16:37.315 --> 16:39.048
- I should have
heeded your warning.

16:39.148 --> 16:41.648
I think I overloaded
my... ... E Stomach.

16:41.815 --> 16:42.948
- What should we do?

16:43.048 --> 16:44.681
- Activated charcoal
will neutralize the effects.

16:44.815 --> 16:46.148
Where are we gonna get that?

16:46.248 --> 16:48.215
- It's also used in case
of accidental poisoning.

16:48.315 --> 16:51.081
- The nurse's office. Let's go.

16:51.181 --> 16:52.881
- That's the most
extreme case of

16:52.981 --> 16:54.815
synchronous diaphragmatic
flutter I've ever heard.

16:54.915 --> 16:56.348
- She should drink
some water upside down.

16:56.448 --> 16:59.248
- Hey, Frankie, why don't you
drink some wa...

17:06.371 --> 17:09.904
- Whoa, that could've been bad.

17:10.003 --> 17:13.003
Because you have
aquagenic urticaria.

17:13.104 --> 17:15.003
A water allergy!

17:19.070 --> 17:21.171
- She's not allergic to water.

17:21.271 --> 17:24.538
She's a robot who can't
get her circuitry wet.

17:24.570 --> 17:27.238
You know, it's a good thing
you're such a klutz, Makayla.

17:27.338 --> 17:30.671
Now I know how to prove to
everyone what Frankie really is.

17:33.604 --> 17:36.104
- Looks like it's working.
Take more of it.

17:37.538 --> 17:39.138
I think you're okay.

17:39.238 --> 17:40.971
Here.

17:42.171 --> 17:43.738
- You are correct,
Dayton Reyes.

17:43.838 --> 17:46.671
I will eat slower from now on.
- Good.

17:48.104 --> 17:49.571
So, wanna flip that coin now?

17:49.671 --> 17:51.004
- No.
- Huh?

17:51.104 --> 17:53.071
You agreed that a randomized
decision maker

17:53.171 --> 17:55.204
was the way to choose
who to go to the dance with.

17:55.304 --> 17:56.838
- Yes, but a coin
isn't truly random.

17:56.938 --> 17:59.104
A coin has a 51% chance
of coming up on the side

17:59.204 --> 18:00.704
that was facing upward
when it's flipped.

18:00.804 --> 18:02.538
- Okay, okay.

18:02.604 --> 18:04.404
Well, what is truly random?

18:08.971 --> 18:12.938
- Alright, the official Cole
and Andrew spheres are ready.

18:17.871 --> 18:20.238
Okay, this is it.

18:27.800 --> 18:29.567
- Maybe we should have
used a bigger tube.

18:29.667 --> 18:31.933
- No, I used the specifications
I found

18:32.033 --> 18:33.500
on the state lottery commission
website.

18:33.600 --> 18:35.433
So it is fair.

18:36.767 --> 18:37.800
- Here we go.

18:37.900 --> 18:41.300
Your first ever date
is going to be with...

18:43.533 --> 18:46.900
- Oh, I knew there was an exact
50/50 chance of it being

18:47.000 --> 18:48.267
Andrew La Pierre,

18:48.367 --> 18:50.767
but somehow I thought
it would come out the other way.

18:50.867 --> 18:52.033
- It's called hoping.

18:52.133 --> 18:54.833
It's another human trait.

18:54.933 --> 18:56.133
- I need to let
Cole Reyes know.

18:56.233 --> 18:57.200
- Wait.

18:57.300 --> 18:59.667
You can't use
a sample size of one.

18:59.767 --> 19:02.933
To be statistically meaningful,
you need to repeat the test.

19:03.033 --> 19:04.800
- You mean...
- Best two out of three.

19:04.900 --> 19:06.867
- Nope, the decision is made.

19:06.967 --> 19:08.767
I have to tell Cole Reyes.

19:12.767 --> 19:13.800
- Who's there?

19:13.900 --> 19:14.900
Janitor.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.600
What are you doing in my closet?

19:16.767 --> 19:17.467
- Uh...

19:17.567 --> 19:19.367
Is that Tammy Gilroy?

19:19.467 --> 19:20.367
- No!

19:20.467 --> 19:21.267
I mean...

19:21.367 --> 19:22.367
No.

19:22.467 --> 19:24.033
Don't lie to me,
Gilroy.

19:24.133 --> 19:26.767
I've had it with you
kids and your disrespect.

19:26.867 --> 19:28.867
I'm telling Ms. Hough on you.

19:28.967 --> 19:31.767
I hope you weren't planning on
going to an Ivy League college,

19:31.867 --> 19:33.867
because you're toast.

19:33.967 --> 19:35.233
You hear me, Gilroy?

19:35.333 --> 19:39.933
Toast with butter
and grape jelly.

19:40.033 --> 19:41.333
- What is wrong with you?

19:41.433 --> 19:43.500
- Oh, come on,
you didn't know it was me?

19:43.600 --> 19:46.200
You texted us, "Meet you
at the janitor's closet."

19:46.300 --> 19:49.133
- I told you she
wouldn't think it was funny.

19:49.233 --> 19:51.300
Makayla said you had
a good sense of humor.

19:51.400 --> 19:53.067
But that would mean you could
laugh at yourself, so...

19:53.167 --> 19:54.700
- Just get in here.

19:59.967 --> 20:01.300
- Honestly,
sometimes I don't know

20:01.400 --> 20:02.567
why I'm friends with you two.

20:02.667 --> 20:04.233
Wait, yes, I do.

20:04.333 --> 20:05.833
I need you guys
to be my lookout.

20:05.933 --> 20:07.100
- Yeah, well good luck
with that.

20:07.200 --> 20:09.033
- What?
- You just insulted us.

20:09.133 --> 20:11.067
Now you want us
to do you a favor?

20:11.167 --> 20:12.000
- You're right.

20:12.100 --> 20:13.267
I was unkind.

20:13.367 --> 20:15.467
But you did just play a
pretty cruel prank on me.

20:15.567 --> 20:17.600
You don't mess with
a girl's college choice.

20:17.700 --> 20:18.800
- Alright, fine.

20:18.900 --> 20:20.400
What do you need us to look for?

20:20.500 --> 20:22.733
- Anyone who might catch me
filling this up.

20:24.033 --> 20:25.367
I'm gonna dump it
on Frankie,

20:25.467 --> 20:27.167
and she's gonna short out
like a busted hairdryer.

20:27.267 --> 20:29.033
And everyone
will know the truth.

20:29.133 --> 20:31.133
- But what if you're wrong?

20:31.233 --> 20:33.400
How will you explain
intentionally soaking a person

20:33.500 --> 20:35.833
who's suffering
from aquagenic urticaria?

20:35.933 --> 20:37.367
- I'm not wrong.
I'm never wrong.

20:37.467 --> 20:38.967
- Yesterday, you said
she was an alien.

20:39.067 --> 20:40.333
- Before that,

20:40.433 --> 20:42.367
you were convinced she had
a hidden radio in her ear.

20:42.467 --> 20:44.233
- And before that...
- Alright, alright.

20:44.333 --> 20:47.100
I suppose an alternate
hypothesis could explain things.

20:47.200 --> 20:48.467
And I could get
in serious trouble

20:48.567 --> 20:50.267
for triggering
a person's allergy.

20:50.367 --> 20:52.167
- I'm glad we've convinced you.
- You do it!

20:52.267 --> 20:53.967
- What? No!
- You never get in trouble.

20:54.067 --> 20:56.067
You've got political capital
to burn with Ms. Hough.

20:56.167 --> 20:57.967
- Make McKayla do it.
- I'm not doing it.

20:58.067 --> 20:59.600
- She can't do it.
- Thank you.

20:59.767 --> 21:01.833
- She's too much of a klutz.
- I am not.

21:01.933 --> 21:03.133
- You are too.
- Really?

21:03.233 --> 21:05.133
- There was that time
you spilled water on Frankie.

21:05.233 --> 21:06.533
- Thank you.
- But that doesn't count.

21:06.633 --> 21:08.967
- It does count.
- It was a pretty big mess.

21:13.467 --> 21:15.367
- Did you just have a spasm
in your ulnar nerve?

21:15.467 --> 21:16.767
Also known as your funny bone?

21:16.800 --> 21:18.033
- Cole's in the hizzy.

21:18.133 --> 21:19.200
- The hizzy?

21:19.300 --> 21:21.100
Is this some type of building?
A vehicle?

21:21.200 --> 21:22.067
A metaphorical state of being?

21:22.167 --> 21:23.533
- He's here.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.233
- Time to break my date
with him.

21:28.333 --> 21:30.767
- Ooh! Great idea alert.

21:30.800 --> 21:32.033
Ask him for raincheck.

21:32.133 --> 21:34.133
- A ticket to a baseball game
that's been rescheduled

21:34.233 --> 21:35.133
due to inclement weather?

21:35.233 --> 21:36.333
- No.

21:36.433 --> 21:38.433
Ask him to do something
on another night,

21:38.533 --> 21:40.167
like go to a movie or to dinner.

21:40.267 --> 21:41.833
- That is a great idea,
Dayton Reyes.

21:41.933 --> 21:43.567
I just need to get my books.

21:47.467 --> 21:48.767
- What's all this stuff?

21:48.800 --> 21:50.800
- I don't know.

21:50.900 --> 21:52.667
- Bob?

21:56.767 --> 21:59.367
Frankie, why?

21:59.467 --> 22:01.267
How could you?
