02:14.465 --> 02:15.998
<i>It all started three weeks ago</i>

02:16.000 --> 02:18.601
<i>when I flew in on
a red-eye from New York.</i>

02:20.805 --> 02:22.806
<i>Nobody in their right mind

the crisis is going</i>

02:25.844 --> 02:27.444
<i>to reach a conclusion,</i>

02:27.446 --> 02:29.813
<i>that everything's going
to fall into chaos.</i>

<i>I thought I would be able
to find something</i>

02:32.684 --> 02:33.849
<i>to write about.</i>

02:33.851 --> 02:37.621
<i>See, I write fiction,
but my novels, um...</i>

02:37.623 --> 02:38.858
<i>aren't really fiction.</i>

02:43.828 --> 02:46.599
You have arrived
at your destination.

02:47.599 --> 02:49.665
You know, uh,
not many people rushin' in

02:49.667 --> 02:52.034
to merry ol' London town
these days.

02:52.036 --> 02:53.670
<i>I answered
a personal ad</i>

02:53.672 --> 02:55.705
<i>in The New York Review
of Books.</i>

02:55.707 --> 02:57.741
<i>The celebrated writer
Mark Asprey</i>

02:57.743 --> 02:59.912
<i>was offering up his apartment
for a swap.</i>

03:02.013 --> 03:04.046
<i>He would have been
overwhelmed with responses</i>

03:04.048 --> 03:05.684
<i>if it weren't for the crisis.</i>

03:07.919 --> 03:09.653
<i>Instead, poor Mark ended up</i>

03:09.655 --> 03:11.791
<i>with my shithole
in Hell's Kitchen.</i>

03:13.625 --> 03:15.024
Well, fuck me.

03:15.026 --> 03:16.059
<i>And I got the keys</i>

03:16.061 --> 03:18.462
<i>to his inspiring
three-bedroom flat</i>

03:18.464 --> 03:20.163
<i>in the heart of London.</i>

03:20.165 --> 03:22.064
<i>Mr. Samson Young.</i>

<i>Mr. Mark Asprey here.</i>

<i>your plane trip, mate.</i>

<i>Make yourself at home.</i>

03:27.273 --> 03:30.940
<i>Do feel free, by the way,
to touch everything.</i>

03:30.942 --> 03:33.075
<i>Everything in that place
has inspired a book</i>

03:33.077 --> 03:36.011
<i>in some way,
or a million sales at least.</i>

03:36.013 --> 03:38.214
<i>And I hope it does that
for you. I really do.</i>

03:38.216 --> 03:40.217
<i>I-I'm sorry
it's not all finished.</i>

03:40.219 --> 03:42.252
<i>You know, I'm refurbishing
the building</i>

03:42.254 --> 03:44.587
<i>but this bloody
panic everywhere,</i>

03:44.589 --> 03:46.956
<i>you just can't get
all the stuff you need</i>

03:46.958 --> 03:48.860
<i>no matter how much money
you throw at the problem.</i>

03:50.262 --> 03:52.729
<i>I left a copy of my
third novel on the desk.</i>

03:52.731 --> 03:54.598
Crossbone Waters.

03:54.600 --> 03:57.766
<i>It never hurts
to reread the classics</i>

03:57.768 --> 03:59.204
<i>for a spot of inspiration.</i>

04:00.672 --> 04:04.477
<i>Your place is just phenomenal.</i>

04:05.177 --> 04:08.278
<i>I had no idea
this would be so...</i>

04:08.280 --> 04:10.046
<i>wonderfully diminished.</i>

04:10.048 --> 04:11.881
<i>As you know,
my latest character</i>

04:11.883 --> 04:13.050
<i>lives in Hell's Kitchen,</i>

04:13.052 --> 04:17.620
<i>and I think I might
make him even poorer.</i>

04:17.623 --> 04:18.954
<i>It's just going
to be delicious,</i>

04:18.957 --> 04:20.623
<i>and I can't thank you enough.</i>

04:20.625 --> 04:22.258
<i>Oh, I just hope
you enjoy yourself.</i>

04:22.260 --> 04:23.495
Hey, tiger.

04:24.630 --> 04:25.895
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

04:25.897 --> 04:29.000
<i>I do hope you get a chance
to enjoy the mirrors.</i>

04:32.303 --> 04:33.236
<i>I do.</i>

04:40.579 --> 04:42.611
<i>Anyway, see you, mate.</i>

04:55.092 --> 04:58.794
<i>If London is a pub
and you want the whole story,</i>

04:58.796 --> 05:00.830
<i>well, where do you go?</i>

05:00.832 --> 05:02.832
<i>You go to a London pub.</i>

05:02.834 --> 05:04.700
Oi!

05:04.702 --> 05:08.037
Here he is. Samson Young.

05:08.039 --> 05:11.007
My famous American friend.

05:11.009 --> 05:14.010
- Now, here we got my boy Thelonius, Dean...
- Yeah, man.

05:14.012 --> 05:17.580
...Zbig, Zbig 2,
Big Dred,

05:17.582 --> 05:20.049
- Shakespeare...
- Shakespeare.

05:20.051 --> 05:22.051
...Norvis, Fucker,

05:22.053 --> 05:25.087
Bogdan, Juniper...

05:25.089 --> 05:29.058
Yeah, that's Pepsi,
Pongo, and God.

05:29.060 --> 05:31.596
And my mate, Guy Clinch.

05:33.731 --> 05:35.164
Nobility, he is.

05:35.166 --> 05:36.700
Yeah, he's like cousin
to the King

05:36.702 --> 05:38.068
or Queen or something.

05:38.070 --> 05:39.702
He had a bit of trouble
when he first come

05:39.704 --> 05:40.936
into the Black Cross,

05:40.938 --> 05:42.938
but I introduced him
to some faces

05:42.940 --> 05:44.911
and now he's got
a face all on his own.

05:46.611 --> 05:49.712
Guy Clinch, Samson Young.

05:49.714 --> 05:51.847
- Pleasure to meet you, Samson.
- Sam's fine.

05:51.849 --> 05:53.849
You know, Sam here
is newly arrived.

05:53.851 --> 05:55.652
American. Writer.

05:55.654 --> 05:57.988
Huh?

05:57.990 --> 06:00.323
Well, fuck me.

06:00.325 --> 06:02.959
- You all right, mon?
- Yeah, loan sharks.

06:02.961 --> 06:04.327
Loan sharks?

06:04.329 --> 06:06.096
Keith, you really
shouldn't be doing that.

06:06.098 --> 06:08.298
What? Eh? Every time
I borrowed money

06:08.300 --> 06:09.798
from you, I paid you back,
didn't I?

06:09.800 --> 06:11.704
Well, no. You've never
actually paid me back.

06:15.740 --> 06:16.739
Pleasure to meet you, Sam.

06:16.741 --> 06:18.674
Yeah, you too.

06:18.676 --> 06:21.645
Yeah, listen. You don't
loan money, do you, Sam, huh?

06:21.647 --> 06:24.013
No, I'm just a broke writer.

06:24.015 --> 06:26.618
Huh. Why should
they own me, right?

06:27.885 --> 06:28.853
Yeah.

06:31.188 --> 06:33.423
But I'm behind on me rent.

06:33.425 --> 06:35.024
Two fucking weeks.

06:35.026 --> 06:37.327
Listen, I appreciate
your trustworthy instincts.

06:37.329 --> 06:38.661
Yeah, right.

06:38.663 --> 06:39.695
<i>I had to borrow a pinch</i>

06:39.697 --> 06:41.197
<i>from me old loan shark,</i>

06:41.199 --> 06:42.368
<i>Kirk Stockist.</i>

06:43.368 --> 06:45.168
<i>Trouble was,
I already owed a ton</i>

06:45.170 --> 06:48.671
<i>for me darts training
and other expenses.</i>

06:48.673 --> 06:51.106
I recognize the stench
but not the face.

06:51.108 --> 06:53.676
<i>So then I had to
borrow money from Ashley Royal</i>

06:53.678 --> 06:55.445
<i>to pay the vig
on Kirk's loan.</i>

06:55.447 --> 06:56.949
You've got a week.

06:58.082 --> 06:59.448
Then you suffer.

06:59.450 --> 07:00.950
<i>Woulda been fine
had it not have been</i>

07:00.952 --> 07:02.786
<i>for an unwise investment.</i>

07:02.788 --> 07:04.354
So now I gotta borrow money

07:04.356 --> 07:06.826
from me old mate
Chick Purchase.

07:08.926 --> 07:11.928
<i>Trouble was, there's a bit
of bad blood between us.</i>

07:11.930 --> 07:12.965
You know something?

07:14.265 --> 07:17.299
I'm actually
fucking ecstatic

07:17.301 --> 07:19.004
to loan you
as much as I can.

07:19.937 --> 07:22.972
So that I can fuck you up
as hard as I can

07:22.974 --> 07:24.306
when you don't pay.

07:24.308 --> 07:26.743
Don't tickle me with that.

07:26.745 --> 07:28.243
And, love...

07:28.245 --> 07:30.746
it will not be
over quickly.

07:30.748 --> 07:32.414
And I promise,

07:32.416 --> 07:33.952
you will not enjoy it.

07:38.423 --> 07:40.893
So, my advice to you...

07:41.926 --> 07:44.029
is to celebrate
while you can...

07:47.332 --> 07:50.366
go and drop a bit
on a bird, eh?

07:50.368 --> 07:52.835
Now, all three
require payment,

07:52.837 --> 07:55.006
immediate and in full.

08:00.245 --> 08:01.380
Take care, love.

08:08.753 --> 08:10.155
You don't play darts,
do you, sir?

08:11.957 --> 08:13.291
I'll give you lessons
if you like.

08:14.760 --> 08:16.859
Darts...

08:16.861 --> 08:18.096
is destiny.

08:22.334 --> 08:23.803
<i>My God.</i>

08:51.396 --> 08:53.395
Do you have any
Gauloises cigarettes?

08:53.397 --> 08:55.999
We don't sell
French fags here, darling.

08:56.001 --> 08:57.299
Carlyle!

08:57.301 --> 08:58.802
Come here.

08:58.804 --> 09:00.102
Right.

09:00.104 --> 09:01.037
Now.

09:01.039 --> 09:02.271
Go and get this lady

09:02.273 --> 09:03.573
her French snouts, will ya?

09:03.575 --> 09:05.975
Go on. Fuck off.

09:05.977 --> 09:09.345
Poor grieving girl, eh?

09:09.347 --> 09:11.280
Is the world
against everything?

09:11.282 --> 09:13.249
I've lived down the road
for over a year now,

09:13.251 --> 09:15.321
and this is the first time
I've been in here.

09:16.320 --> 09:17.922
Always wondered
what it was like.

09:19.424 --> 09:20.925
Just never had the courage.

09:22.426 --> 09:24.360
I suppose this is...

09:24.362 --> 09:25.995
by way of having been
at a wake?

09:25.997 --> 09:28.130
Yeah. Weren't family,
was he?

09:28.132 --> 09:29.899
Not anyone I knew very well.

09:29.901 --> 09:31.303
Still. Does you credit.

09:32.204 --> 09:34.270
No, shows respect,
don't it?

09:34.272 --> 09:36.239
<i>Here we are
at the event horizon</i>

09:36.241 --> 09:37.810
<i>of a black hole.</i>

09:41.445 --> 09:43.847
<i>Anything, including
matter and photons,</i>

09:43.849 --> 09:46.484
<i>that pass this boundary
are unable to escape.</i>

09:50.188 --> 09:51.855
A black veil.

09:51.857 --> 09:53.358
It's ironic
how becoming it is.

09:54.859 --> 09:57.195
One never gets enough
opportunity to wear one.

09:58.128 --> 10:00.362
People should die
more often.

10:00.364 --> 10:02.300
What's your name,
sweetheart?

10:04.301 --> 10:06.202
Nicola Six.

10:06.204 --> 10:08.170
What? Sex? Huh.

10:08.172 --> 10:10.475
It's S-I-X.

10:17.616 --> 10:18.884
Fuck off.

10:21.185 --> 10:22.418
Thank you.

10:22.420 --> 10:24.287
Now, huh.

10:27.959 --> 10:29.992
An honor...

10:29.994 --> 10:31.930
to service you.

10:48.512 --> 10:49.581
You all right?

10:52.383 --> 10:53.348
Sorry.

10:53.350 --> 10:54.419
Thank you.

10:55.586 --> 10:56.921
I must be leaving now.

10:59.023 --> 11:00.191
You've been very kind.

11:05.063 --> 11:06.395
Keith...

11:06.397 --> 11:08.597
You're...
You're not, are you?

11:08.599 --> 11:10.165
A girl like that?

11:10.167 --> 11:11.400
A girl like what?

11:11.402 --> 11:14.370
- Well...
- Mate, she's dreaming of it.

11:14.372 --> 11:16.172
Yeah, she's begging for it.

11:16.174 --> 11:18.106
She's just been
to a funeral, Keith.

11:18.108 --> 11:19.578
Well, then
she's praying for it.

11:21.713 --> 11:24.480
Life fucking goes on,
don't it, eh?

11:24.482 --> 11:25.581
<i>With Keith and Guy,</i>

11:25.583 --> 11:28.217
<i>I had two promising
story characters.</i>

11:28.219 --> 11:30.555
<i>Two men forming
a social contrast.</i>

11:34.325 --> 11:37.028
<i>But none of this would have
started without the girl.</i>

11:43.468 --> 11:45.237
<i>There was no book
without the girl.</i>

11:50.575 --> 11:52.342
You know, they say
the first thing that will go

11:52.344 --> 11:54.246
with the hot sun
will be the flowers.

11:56.547 --> 11:58.349
Won't be any more flowers.

12:03.287 --> 12:05.454
Now, I see
a girl like you.

12:05.456 --> 12:07.323
You know, bit of a beauty.

12:07.325 --> 12:09.424
Head in the clouds, as such.

12:09.426 --> 12:12.462
Now, me? I'm Handy Andy.

12:12.464 --> 12:14.065
You know, I'm Mr. Fixit.

12:18.069 --> 12:20.502
So what's your
phone number, Nick?

12:20.504 --> 12:22.607
Of all things, she lives
in my building.

12:24.342 --> 12:25.276
Remarkable.

12:27.478 --> 12:29.412
<i>The pain kit
from Dr. Slizzard</i>

12:29.414 --> 12:31.246
<i>arrived in good time.</i>

12:31.248 --> 12:33.118
<i>Like a box of candy.</i>

12:38.455 --> 12:39.991
<i>Why can't I do it?</i>

12:40.691 --> 12:42.293
<i>Why can't I just write?</i>

12:45.397 --> 12:48.467
<i>I write. I'm a writer.</i>

14:15.719 --> 14:17.720
<i>From the moment
Nicola's thoughts began</i>

14:17.722 --> 14:19.454
<i>to be consecutive,</i>

14:19.456 --> 14:21.491
<i>she knew two strange things.</i>

14:21.493 --> 14:24.159
<i>I've always known
what was going to happen next.</i>

14:24.161 --> 14:26.462
<i>The second was that
she must never tell anyone</i>

14:26.464 --> 14:27.663
<i>about the first.</i>

14:27.665 --> 14:30.165
<i>Hers was a specific kind
of fortune telling.</i>

14:30.167 --> 14:33.870
<i>Nicola saw the death
of many, many things.</i>

14:33.872 --> 14:35.737
<i>She knew her young friend
Dominique</i>

14:35.739 --> 14:37.073
<i>would fall to her death.</i>

14:37.075 --> 14:41.309
<i>How painful. I was
prepared for Mom and Dad.</i>

14:41.311 --> 14:43.813
<i>She knew her parents
would die in a plane crash.</i>

14:43.815 --> 14:46.582
<i>They both died,
together,</i>

14:46.584 --> 14:48.885
<i>as I always knew they would.</i>

14:48.887 --> 14:50.488
<i>So why love anyone?</i>

14:53.190 --> 14:55.560
<i>I met the surviving
pilot and slept with him.</i>

14:56.860 --> 14:59.430
<i>If the crash didn't
kill him, love would.</i>

15:00.297 --> 15:03.632
<i>She saw the circles
of concentric devastation</i>

15:03.634 --> 15:06.871
<i>with London like a bull's-eye
in the center of the board.</i>

15:09.474 --> 15:11.175
<i>She knew that was coming.</i>

15:12.243 --> 15:14.713
<i>Nicola knew when
her own story ended, too.</i>

15:15.780 --> 15:17.882
<i>Some minutes after midnight...</i>

15:18.849 --> 15:20.853
<i>on her 30th birthday.</i>

15:21.886 --> 15:23.454
<i>Guy Fawkes Day.</i>

15:24.789 --> 15:26.325
<i>Her final entry.</i>

15:27.658 --> 15:29.592
<i>"In the Black Cross Pub."</i>

15:29.594 --> 15:31.360
<i>I found my murderer.</i>

15:31.362 --> 15:32.595
<i>"I found my murderer."</i>

15:32.597 --> 15:33.665
<i>I met him.</i>

15:34.599 --> 15:35.566
"Today."

15:45.576 --> 15:46.909
- Yes?
- Oh, hello.

15:46.911 --> 15:48.778
Uh, my name
is Samson Young.

15:48.780 --> 15:50.612
I live downstairs.

15:50.614 --> 15:51.582
Um...

16:09.300 --> 16:10.301
Are you gonna sit down?

16:12.502 --> 16:13.638
Thank you.

16:18.810 --> 16:19.844
Okay.

16:21.945 --> 16:24.382
So I, uh,
I read everything.

16:25.950 --> 16:26.951
Look...

16:28.485 --> 16:29.420
I'm a writer.

16:30.854 --> 16:31.956
Anything I might know?

16:33.523 --> 16:34.959
I seriously doubt it.

16:37.695 --> 16:40.799
Listen. I believe
your premonitions.

16:44.401 --> 16:45.937
I believe you see
your death.

16:51.642 --> 16:53.311
So who's going to kill you?

16:56.781 --> 16:57.782
I don't know.

17:00.951 --> 17:02.954
I just know
he was there yesterday.

17:08.959 --> 17:11.893
I've always wanted to write
a murder novel, but I...

17:11.895 --> 17:14.632
was never close
enough to it. I...

17:15.666 --> 17:20.035
Um... I-I believe
I would have to be there,

17:20.037 --> 17:21.440
recording it.

17:22.873 --> 17:24.008
Would you let me do that?

17:25.476 --> 17:27.378
I think you could be
my masterpiece.

17:32.784 --> 17:33.752
Yes.

17:48.865 --> 17:50.368
I know what you're thinking.

17:51.102 --> 17:52.470
It's a gift.

17:53.603 --> 17:55.007
And I'm going to take it.

17:56.373 --> 17:57.608
Regardless.

17:59.009 --> 18:00.945
<i>She was a great character.</i>

18:01.912 --> 18:03.614
<i>A fascinating creature.</i>

18:07.517 --> 18:08.487
<i>Compelling.</i>

18:09.687 --> 18:10.889
<i>Self-destructive.</i>

18:14.892 --> 18:15.925
<i>I had the makings</i>

18:15.927 --> 18:17.963
<i>of a really snappy
little thriller.</i>

18:36.447 --> 18:38.050
<i>She entered the Black Cross.</i>

18:39.517 --> 18:42.150
<i>She entered the pub
and its murk.</i>

18:42.152 --> 18:45.420
<i>She lifted her veil
with both hands like a bride.</i>

18:45.422 --> 18:47.890
<i>Surveyed the main actors
of the scene,</i>

18:47.892 --> 18:50.692
<i>and immediately
she knew, with pain,</i>

18:50.694 --> 18:52.630
<i>within intense recognition,</i>

18:53.564 --> 18:56.564
<i>that she had found him,
her murderer.</i>

18:56.566 --> 18:58.002
I just had a deja vu.

19:01.905 --> 19:04.707
<i>Nicola awoke
and heard the rain</i>

19:04.709 --> 19:06.809
<i>and went back to sleep again.</i>

19:06.811 --> 19:07.976
<i>Or she tried.</i>

19:10.547 --> 19:11.714
<i>I want more</i>

19:11.716 --> 19:14.015
<i>of that Mark Asprey.</i>

19:14.017 --> 19:15.985
<i>That's what I want more of.</i>

19:15.987 --> 19:17.686
<i>Not to be greedy, my love,</i>

19:17.688 --> 19:19.822
<i>but you cannot expect
a girl to go gentle</i>

19:19.824 --> 19:22.591
<i>into that good night
after having received</i>

19:22.593 --> 19:24.563
<i>such an otherworldly fucking.</i>

20:02.200 --> 20:03.602
Come in.

20:05.135 --> 20:06.904
Mr. Handy Andy.

20:09.606 --> 20:11.073
Are you famous?

20:11.075 --> 20:13.044
Everyone has their dreams.

20:14.845 --> 20:16.512
You want a drink
or something?

20:16.514 --> 20:17.780
No, not for me, darling.

20:17.782 --> 20:19.881
Work before pleasure, innit?

20:19.883 --> 20:22.051
But you're already quite drunk,
aren't you, Keith?

20:22.053 --> 20:24.954
<i>Fuck me.</i>

20:24.956 --> 20:28.827
<i>Keith.
"Fuck me." Belches.</i>

20:33.797 --> 20:35.197
Ow!

20:35.199 --> 20:36.799
<i>Fuck it!</i>

20:36.801 --> 20:39.104
Me fucking darts thumb.

20:40.071 --> 20:41.269
Look.

20:41.271 --> 20:42.971
Look, I know the knockers
take the piss

20:42.973 --> 20:44.806
out of the sport
these days.

20:44.808 --> 20:46.809
But I happen to have
reached the last 32

20:46.811 --> 20:48.944
in the Duoshare Sparrow Masters.

20:48.946 --> 20:51.846
You know, one more win
and Keith Talent here

20:51.848 --> 20:54.082
will be televised.

20:54.084 --> 20:57.456
- You're dripping blood.
- Eh? Oh.

21:00.557 --> 21:01.792
Let me see.

21:05.997 --> 21:07.696
Are you married?

21:07.698 --> 21:08.967
No.

21:13.738 --> 21:17.206
Well, me wife thinks she is.

21:17.208 --> 21:18.207
How about children?

21:18.209 --> 21:19.307
Oh, no. No, no, no.

21:19.309 --> 21:20.578
God, no.

21:22.013 --> 21:24.112
Yeah, a little girl we got.

21:24.114 --> 21:26.617
Princess. Lovely, she is.

21:27.317 --> 21:29.017
<i>What about you, eh?</i>

21:29.019 --> 21:31.586
<i>You know what
babies do, Keith, don't you?</i>

21:31.588 --> 21:32.890
<i>They ruin your figure.</i>

21:34.758 --> 21:36.026
<i>And one other thing.</i>

21:37.128 --> 21:38.561
The man you
introduced me to

21:38.563 --> 21:39.930
the other day
at the Black Cross,

21:40.998 --> 21:42.297
the posh one?

21:42.299 --> 21:44.166
Oh, yeah.

21:44.168 --> 21:45.935
Guy Clinch?

21:45.937 --> 21:46.738
I'd like to meet him.

21:48.305 --> 21:50.171
You could arrange that,
couldn't you?

21:52.276 --> 21:54.109
<i>Have Guy call.</i>

21:54.111 --> 21:55.947
And do it now, please.

21:58.348 --> 21:59.750
Is it gonna be Keith?

22:01.117 --> 22:03.052
Well, he's kind of
an animal presence,

22:03.054 --> 22:04.186
wouldn't you say?

22:05.922 --> 22:07.526
I bet he's an animal in bed.

22:08.726 --> 22:10.128
But animals can be trained.

22:11.128 --> 22:12.130
Can't they?

22:13.163 --> 22:14.632
Yes, ma'am.

22:24.775 --> 22:26.976
You know, I went round that Nicky's house.
You know, Nicola.

22:26.978 --> 22:28.377
The one in the veil
in the Black Cross.

22:28.379 --> 22:29.777
Right.

22:29.779 --> 22:31.647
Now, I thought she
might want seeing to.

22:31.649 --> 22:33.716
What, you mean her flat?

22:33.718 --> 22:34.853
Don't be daft.

22:36.953 --> 22:37.886
Here.

22:39.957 --> 22:41.293
No, she's a funny one,
that one.

22:42.192 --> 22:44.793
One minute she's
coming on dead tasty.

22:44.795 --> 22:46.698
And then the next minute,
she's Lady Muck.

22:47.664 --> 22:49.297
So, did, uh...

22:49.299 --> 22:50.365
Did anything happen?

22:50.367 --> 22:52.102
Nah. Fuck all, really.

22:53.970 --> 22:56.775
I took my leave,
and she's asking about you.

22:58.709 --> 22:59.777
The...

23:00.678 --> 23:02.410
- About me?
- Yeah.

23:02.412 --> 23:03.914
Wants you to phone her.

23:05.850 --> 23:06.918
How, uh...

23:08.419 --> 23:10.354
How exactly does she
require my help?

23:11.255 --> 23:12.357
Don't ask me, mate.

23:13.257 --> 23:15.026
Maybe she likes her own sort.

23:17.961 --> 23:19.296
I'm going to take a nap.

23:20.163 --> 23:22.066
- Hello.
- Do you mind?

23:29.140 --> 23:31.242
Oh, yes.

23:32.308 --> 23:34.109
Smashing wife.

23:34.111 --> 23:36.311
Smashing wife.

23:36.313 --> 23:38.149
Find out
how much Keith owes...

23:39.150 --> 23:40.352
and take care of it.

23:43.453 --> 23:45.956
You know, I told Keith
to have Guy call me.

23:48.325 --> 23:49.661
I'm sure he will.

23:56.132 --> 23:59.703
Keith. I couldn't ask you
a favor, could I?

24:00.438 --> 24:03.805
To look after the child
for 20 minutes. It's my shift.

24:03.807 --> 24:06.441
Of course I can. Ah.

24:06.443 --> 24:08.944
Oh, no. I love
the little one.

24:08.946 --> 24:10.845
What you doing?

24:10.847 --> 24:13.050
You having a little war
on words, are you?

24:13.984 --> 24:16.084
I got a book here
you might like.

24:16.086 --> 24:18.887
Have a look at this book.

24:18.889 --> 24:20.889
Yeah, nice picture book.

24:20.891 --> 24:22.890
Kelly, that is.

24:22.892 --> 24:24.362
She's a vegetarian.

24:27.331 --> 24:30.001
Oh, you want some
of that? Here, go on.

24:31.235 --> 24:34.002
That's it.
Breathe it right down.

24:34.004 --> 24:35.273
Down like a man.

24:36.539 --> 24:39.810
<i>You know, Guy seemed
so sweet and gentle.</i>

24:41.077 --> 24:43.044
You know, he might be
capable of loving me.

24:44.748 --> 24:46.948
It's Guy Clinch.
Is Nicola Six there, please?

24:46.950 --> 24:48.217
<i>Speaking.</i>

24:48.219 --> 24:49.918
<i>I'm not disturbing you
at all, am I?</i>

24:49.920 --> 24:52.920
No, no, not at all.
I-I'd like your help.

24:52.922 --> 24:55.424
If it wouldn't be too much
out of... out of your way.

24:55.426 --> 24:56.859
Do you think we could meet?

24:56.861 --> 25:00.763
<i>She's setting up the
oldest conflict in the world.</i>

25:00.765 --> 25:03.064
<i>Two men. One woman.</i>

25:03.066 --> 25:04.268
<i>Someone dies.</i>

25:12.442 --> 25:13.911
<i>Guy Clinch.</i>

25:15.078 --> 25:17.345
<i>When he woke up in the morning,
there was no life.</i>

25:17.347 --> 25:20.050
<i>So life could loom up
on him at any moment.</i>

25:21.518 --> 25:24.986
So, just when things were
starting to finally open up

25:24.988 --> 25:26.257
between my parents and I...

25:27.490 --> 25:29.557
they died
in a plane crash.

25:29.559 --> 25:31.829
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry, Nicola.

25:32.930 --> 25:34.329
Thank you.

25:34.331 --> 25:36.234
That's when I joined
the convent.

25:37.535 --> 25:39.967
They sent me
to work in India

25:39.969 --> 25:42.905
where I, uh, worked
in an orphanage there.

25:42.907 --> 25:43.975
Wow.

25:48.245 --> 25:49.180
Mmm.

25:54.017 --> 25:55.085
Mmm.

25:56.853 --> 25:57.855
Hmm.

25:59.890 --> 26:01.126
I take it you're married?

26:03.494 --> 26:06.131
Yes. Yeah.
Nine years now.

26:07.030 --> 26:08.098
You must be a romantic.

26:08.998 --> 26:11.199
- Like me.
- Funny though...

26:11.201 --> 26:13.601
Romantic life never
quite matches up...

26:13.603 --> 26:14.805
somehow.

26:15.506 --> 26:18.877
Still, one must
never give up hope.

26:24.315 --> 26:26.881
There was something
I wanted to ask you.

26:26.883 --> 26:28.118
Yeah, of course.

26:29.219 --> 26:30.585
So when I was
in the orphanage,

26:30.587 --> 26:32.920
I was friends with
a little Burmese girl.

26:32.922 --> 26:34.526
She was a few years
younger than me.

26:36.559 --> 26:38.126
We were like sisters.

26:38.128 --> 26:40.896
And I promised her one day
we would live together.

26:40.898 --> 26:42.363
That I'd get her out.

26:42.365 --> 26:45.033
But when I returned, I found
out that she'd been adopted

26:45.035 --> 26:47.201
by a Saudi businessman.

26:47.203 --> 26:48.469
Right.

26:48.471 --> 26:50.104
She had his son.

26:50.106 --> 26:51.305
God.

26:51.307 --> 26:53.542
And when he washed
his hands of her,

26:53.544 --> 26:55.513
she was repatriated
back to Burma.

26:56.412 --> 26:58.348
Now she's not even
allowed back into England.

26:59.249 --> 27:00.882
It's just such a mess.

27:00.884 --> 27:01.853
Yeah.

27:02.786 --> 27:06.053
I just figured you were
the sort of person

27:06.055 --> 27:07.225
who might know someone.

27:09.058 --> 27:10.094
Higher up.

27:11.295 --> 27:14.062
Of course. Yeah, yeah.
I can... I can...

27:14.064 --> 27:15.300
I can definitely try.

27:17.367 --> 27:19.434
Her name is Enola Gay.

27:19.436 --> 27:21.136
And her son
is simply known as

27:21.138 --> 27:22.173
Little Boy.

27:24.173 --> 27:25.309
Right.

27:27.044 --> 27:28.643
Sorry, er...

27:28.645 --> 27:31.112
Eno-Enola Gay, is it?

27:31.114 --> 27:33.515
That's it. Nothing else.
Little Boy.

27:33.517 --> 27:34.585
Yeah.

27:47.363 --> 27:49.499
<i>All I know for sure
is the last scene.</i>

27:51.067 --> 27:54.201
<i>The car, the car tool,</i>

27:54.203 --> 27:56.106
<i>the murderer waiting
in his car.</i>

28:00.143 --> 28:02.247
<i>The murderee
walking towards him.</i>

28:04.981 --> 28:06.281
<i>But I don't know
how to get</i>

28:06.283 --> 28:07.651
<i>to the dead-end street.</i>

28:14.991 --> 28:16.094
Was that the car?

28:25.401 --> 28:27.171
Guy is just so sweet.

28:29.573 --> 28:31.109
So, it's gonna be Guy.

28:33.142 --> 28:34.743
Well, it's his car,

28:34.745 --> 28:37.079
and he's falling in love.

28:37.081 --> 28:39.517
It normally ends
very badly with me.

28:42.553 --> 28:45.019
<i>Guy Clinch was a good guy.</i>

28:45.021 --> 28:46.390
<i>Or a nice one, anyway.</i>

28:47.458 --> 28:48.690
<i>He worked
for the family business,</i>

28:48.692 --> 28:51.192
<i>trying to keep tabs
on the proliferating hydra</i>

28:51.194 --> 28:52.262
<i>of Clinch money.</i>

28:54.664 --> 28:57.466
<i>Guy wanted for nothing
and lacked everything.</i>

28:57.468 --> 29:00.401
<i>Guy had money, health,
handsomeness,</i>

29:00.403 --> 29:01.602
<i>and he was lifeless.</i>

29:01.604 --> 29:04.639
Nice joint
you got here. Yeah.

29:04.641 --> 29:06.440
<i>For years, he'd been trying
to have a child</i>

29:06.442 --> 29:07.945
<i>with his wife Hope.</i>

29:17.054 --> 29:18.022
Excuse me.

29:19.288 --> 29:20.354
<i>They used to worry
about the kind of world</i>

29:20.356 --> 29:22.392
<i>they were bringing
their child into.</i>

29:34.203 --> 29:35.704
<i>But when their prayers
were answered,</i>

29:35.706 --> 29:37.371
<i>they worried
about what kind of child</i>

29:37.373 --> 29:39.142
<i>they were bringing
into the world.</i>

29:42.478 --> 29:45.182
<i>Guy always thought it was
life he was looking for.</i>

29:47.383 --> 29:49.019
<i>But it must have been death.</i>

30:03.200 --> 30:05.667
Keith, I've been waiting
for you all morning.

30:05.669 --> 30:07.101
Would you take Kim
for a bit, please?

30:07.103 --> 30:08.637
Nah, love, fuck off.

30:08.639 --> 30:09.771
Look, I'm fucking busy,
all right?

30:09.773 --> 30:11.540
I got me darts class to teach.

30:11.542 --> 30:13.675
She's got the hiccups,
and I...

30:13.677 --> 30:15.146
I-I'm feeling a bit dizzy.

30:16.113 --> 30:17.446
Why, what's the matter
with you?

30:17.448 --> 30:18.716
- Eh?
- Please.

30:20.651 --> 30:22.249
Here, come here.

30:22.251 --> 30:23.620
Eh? Come here, you.

30:25.721 --> 30:27.656
I'm a dart.
What kind of dart am I?

30:27.658 --> 30:28.857
You're the finisher.

30:28.859 --> 30:30.225
Yeah, that's right.

30:30.227 --> 30:31.759
What does a finishing dart do?

30:31.761 --> 30:32.861
Bullseye.

30:32.863 --> 30:34.332
You're a little angel,
you are.

30:35.265 --> 30:36.334
Come on.

30:39.469 --> 30:41.372
Premium shot, Samson.

30:42.538 --> 30:44.538
Imagine the dart's
like a pen.

30:44.540 --> 30:46.643
Write a love letter
to treble 13.

30:47.878 --> 30:49.547
Sealed with a kiss.

30:51.481 --> 30:54.051
Guy Fawkes Day's
coming up, Keith.

30:57.754 --> 30:59.057
Here, darling.

31:03.727 --> 31:05.363
You know what happened
to him, right?

31:07.131 --> 31:08.266
No?

31:09.466 --> 31:10.468
Oh.

31:11.367 --> 31:13.236
Then today is your lucky day.

31:15.605 --> 31:18.573
'Cause I'm like
a fucking historian, ain't I?

31:18.575 --> 31:19.811
Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi.

31:22.278 --> 31:25.782
He was hanged,
drawn, and quartered.

31:27.450 --> 31:29.820
And I know this might
sound unpleasant.

31:31.587 --> 31:34.392
But I might just have
to fucking Guy Fawkes you.

31:35.792 --> 31:37.328
I thought he was burned.

31:38.362 --> 31:39.464
If they burned him...

31:40.430 --> 31:41.865
he was already dead,
weren't he?

31:43.400 --> 31:44.599
Know what I mean?

31:44.601 --> 31:46.704
Ashes to ashes, like,
dust to dust.

31:48.438 --> 31:49.838
What?

31:49.840 --> 31:51.709
It's fucking dirt
and worms, mate.

31:52.642 --> 31:54.845
It's fucking dirt
and worms.

31:58.815 --> 31:59.816
Ooh.

32:00.717 --> 32:02.186
One more thing.

32:03.286 --> 32:05.222
I bought out
all your debts.

32:06.289 --> 32:09.359
So, no-one left
to borrow from.

32:16.632 --> 32:17.634
She's lovely.

32:18.535 --> 32:19.737
The little girl.

32:25.842 --> 32:27.842
<i>I decided to send
the first three chapters</i>

32:27.844 --> 32:31.213
<i>to my long-time publisher,
Missy Harter.</i>

32:31.215 --> 32:34.352
<i>I knew Missy.
It was right up her alley.</i>

32:35.786 --> 32:37.622
<i>Callous and sensational.</i>

32:38.555 --> 32:40.423
<i>She wouldn't be able
to resist.</i>

32:51.434 --> 32:53.368
<i>The normal accepted laws
of writing</i>

32:53.370 --> 32:54.969
<i>are working backwards.</i>

32:54.971 --> 32:57.706
<i>What started out
as reality fiction</i>

32:57.708 --> 33:00.611
<i>is becoming more and more
unvarnished reality.</i>

33:01.612 --> 33:04.879
<i>I have to keep reminding
myself that this is a story.</i>

33:04.881 --> 33:06.814
<i>I'm writing a story.</i>

33:06.816 --> 33:08.752
<i>If I can just get
the balance right.</i>

33:11.888 --> 33:13.588
<i>501 up.</i>

33:13.590 --> 33:15.760
<i>It's the Texas
Hold'em of darts.</i>

33:16.860 --> 33:19.326
<i>The rules are pretty simple.</i>

33:19.328 --> 33:22.730
<i>You have to score
exactly 501 points.</i>

33:22.732 --> 33:24.332
<i>You go over, you bust.</i>

33:24.334 --> 33:25.766
Play the game!

33:25.768 --> 33:27.334
<i>That's about it.</i>

33:41.817 --> 33:43.820
Come on.

34:30.466 --> 34:34.871
The Black Cross Pub!
Tossing them out one by one!

34:50.087 --> 34:51.422
Excuse me.

34:54.357 --> 34:55.426
Not afraid?

34:56.759 --> 34:57.926
<i>Nicola used to think that</i>

34:57.928 --> 35:00.527
<i>she might be saved by love.</i>

35:00.529 --> 35:01.899
<i>But it never happened.</i>

35:02.933 --> 35:04.732
<i>She could make
a man feel he was,</i>

35:04.734 --> 35:06.437
<i>at last, really living.</i>

35:07.471 --> 35:09.737
<i>She could attract it.</i>

35:09.739 --> 35:11.038
<i>She could bring love in.</i>

35:11.040 --> 35:13.975
- Nicola.
- <i>Couldn't send love out.</i>

35:13.977 --> 35:15.578
Coming.

35:20.015 --> 35:26.587
<i>♪ She wore an itsy bitsy ♪</i>

35:26.589 --> 35:29.656
Do you know the origin
of the word "bikini," Keith?

35:29.658 --> 35:31.025
You what?

35:31.027 --> 35:33.728
Bikini, it's from the
Bikini Atoll in the Pacific,

35:33.730 --> 35:36.400
where the US conducted
atomic bomb tests.

35:39.902 --> 35:42.073
I know all about
your money trouble, Keith.

35:45.674 --> 35:47.010
And very soon...

35:48.444 --> 35:49.979
I'm gonna give you
a lot of money.

35:51.181 --> 35:53.818
Oh, I wanna believe
that you will.

35:59.556 --> 36:01.755
Guy is supporting
a foreigner and her son

36:01.757 --> 36:03.558
in their efforts
to escape Burma.

36:03.560 --> 36:06.161
Very oppressed people.

36:06.163 --> 36:08.565
Poor, unfortunate, really.

36:09.866 --> 36:14.935
And you, Keith, can get 30,000
just for setting things up.

36:16.705 --> 36:19.908
Nicola, I have some, er,
some rather bad news.

36:19.910 --> 36:21.879
I thought that... Hello?

36:27.783 --> 36:29.650
It's coming.

36:29.652 --> 36:31.388
This is just a little...

36:32.221 --> 36:33.690
to start you off.

36:39.495 --> 36:40.895
Oh, Nicky.

36:40.897 --> 36:43.130
Do you know
what that looks like?

36:43.132 --> 36:45.632
A gun barrel in a holster?

36:47.703 --> 36:49.006
Exactly.

36:54.743 --> 36:57.814
You can have the money
if you don't touch.

37:01.817 --> 37:05.022
The qualities
of patience and coolness

37:06.256 --> 37:09.192
that I imagine you apply
to your darts, Keith...

37:10.826 --> 37:12.495
apply to me.

37:18.868 --> 37:20.036
Nicola?

37:23.973 --> 37:25.575
You'll find with me...

37:27.743 --> 37:30.180
when it rains, it pours.

37:37.921 --> 37:39.156
And when it pours...

37:41.757 --> 37:43.160
I get rather wet.

37:55.839 --> 37:57.938
Take this.

37:57.940 --> 38:01.009
And this. You don't have
to do anything nasty

38:01.011 --> 38:02.676
with it, Keith. Just props.

38:02.678 --> 38:04.879
For Guy.

38:04.881 --> 38:07.084
Now, leave my flat.

38:09.986 --> 38:11.752
Hello, mate.

38:11.754 --> 38:12.756
Hello, Keith.

38:22.966 --> 38:24.031
Nicola?

38:24.033 --> 38:25.702
Sorry. I was just changing.

38:27.203 --> 38:28.272
Hello.

38:30.806 --> 38:32.142
It's lovely to see you.

38:33.643 --> 38:34.945
Look, er...

38:36.046 --> 38:39.149
Some bad news.
I made some calls. Um...

38:40.951 --> 38:42.820
But I didn't come up
with anything in Burma.

38:44.788 --> 38:45.756
I'm sorry.

38:46.689 --> 38:47.690
I...

38:50.694 --> 38:54.062
I'm not gonna stop trying.
I-I haven't given up.

38:54.064 --> 38:55.196
Well, yet.

38:58.602 --> 39:00.170
Seems a bit stupid now,
but I...

39:02.138 --> 39:04.038
I bought you a gift. Er...

39:04.040 --> 39:06.710
It's hardly a consolation prize,
but I thought it'd be...

39:07.611 --> 39:09.613
something to cheer you up.
It's a...

39:11.348 --> 39:12.879
It's a globe.

39:12.881 --> 39:13.917
Obviously.

39:15.151 --> 39:16.252
There's Burma.

39:17.921 --> 39:19.219
Would you do me a favor?

39:19.221 --> 39:20.623
Yes, of course.

39:21.690 --> 39:23.690
Would you please take these
to a jewelry store

39:23.692 --> 39:24.993
for me and sell them?

39:24.995 --> 39:26.627
I'm sure they'll
just take advantage of me

39:26.629 --> 39:28.064
if I try to do it myself.

39:29.232 --> 39:30.868
They were my grandmother's.

39:31.768 --> 39:33.167
I don't know
how much they're worth

39:33.169 --> 39:34.701
but I think
it should be enough

39:34.703 --> 39:36.073
to get me a plane ticket.

39:37.540 --> 39:39.774
It's just that I got a call from
my Foreign Office friend yesterday,

39:39.776 --> 39:41.978
and he's going to come
into London to talk to me.

39:43.245 --> 39:44.946
He's found Enola
and Little Boy,

39:44.948 --> 39:46.714
but there are warlords

39:46.716 --> 39:48.181
and all sorts
of complications,

39:48.183 --> 39:50.620
and they need to be paid
in order to get out and...

39:51.388 --> 39:52.786
I don't know what else to do.

39:52.788 --> 39:54.022
It's all right,
it's all right.

39:54.024 --> 39:55.757
I think I should come
with you, all right?

39:55.759 --> 39:56.961
It'll be safer.

40:00.363 --> 40:02.600
I promised my friend
I would be alone.

40:04.834 --> 40:06.433
Well, in that case,

40:06.435 --> 40:09.770
I'll come
but I'll keep at a distance.

40:09.772 --> 40:10.774
All right?

40:12.042 --> 40:13.110
Look.

40:14.210 --> 40:15.746
I'm gonna take care
of everything.

40:16.946 --> 40:18.882
Everything from here on in.

40:24.120 --> 40:25.987
You really are a good person.

40:25.989 --> 40:27.057
Yeah.

40:29.225 --> 40:31.225
Let's put these back
where they belong, shall we?

40:31.227 --> 40:36.330
Oh, I'm sorry.

40:36.332 --> 40:38.201
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

41:14.337 --> 41:15.902
Mi Mi's mother's very sick

41:15.904 --> 41:18.406
and we have to go
to Hong Kong.

41:18.408 --> 41:21.042
She would very much like
to clean for you

41:21.044 --> 41:22.145
when we get back.

41:23.747 --> 41:24.781
Don't worry.

41:25.915 --> 41:27.951
I understand completely.

41:28.852 --> 41:30.016
Here's a check.

41:30.018 --> 41:32.089
I'm sorry
the last one bounced.

41:44.234 --> 41:45.533
Looks trustworthy.

41:45.535 --> 41:48.439
What was his, er...
What was his estimate?

41:49.339 --> 41:50.841
60,000.

41:54.009 --> 41:55.111
60,000?

41:56.245 --> 41:57.346
Right.

41:59.082 --> 42:01.783
Can you find out whether
it's in pounds or dollars

42:01.785 --> 42:03.886
or kyat, I think.

42:09.526 --> 42:11.525
I'm so sorry to bring you
into all of this.

42:11.527 --> 42:13.296
No, no, it's...

42:14.531 --> 42:16.967
It's gratifying for me
to help, do you understand?

42:18.334 --> 42:19.435
We're gonna save them.

42:20.402 --> 42:22.105
Enola and her Little Boy.

42:25.073 --> 42:26.342
It's pounds.

42:28.944 --> 42:29.946
Right.

42:30.846 --> 42:31.848
Of course.

42:32.582 --> 42:33.917

Exactly. That's what

<i>to her dinner with Keith.</i>

44:16.986 --> 44:19.053
Akbar!

44:19.055 --> 44:20.687
Get her a fucking menu,
will you?

44:20.689 --> 44:22.925
Double gin and tonic, please.

44:23.625 --> 44:25.294
<i>"I'm on
a special diet."</i>

44:27.230 --> 44:28.298
No food.

44:29.498 --> 44:31.998
Is there a good reason
why you're late?

44:32.000 --> 44:33.536
Did you dress up for me?

44:36.105 --> 44:38.205
You look so handsome.

44:38.207 --> 44:41.609
You remind me of the king
of Saudi Arabia.

44:41.611 --> 44:44.245
<i>"I once slept,"
she said, "experimentally,</i>

44:44.247 --> 44:46.413
<i>with the king
of Saudi Arabia."</i>

44:46.415 --> 44:49.049
He had his men search
the entire world

44:49.051 --> 44:51.120
for the most beautiful
women alive.

44:53.388 --> 44:55.992
People do want value
for their money.

44:57.426 --> 44:58.725
Don't they, Keith?

44:58.727 --> 45:00.430
Yeah, absolutely.

45:01.431 --> 45:03.563
Absolutely they do.

45:03.565 --> 45:05.636
The thing
about the king was...

45:24.152 --> 45:25.652
<i>"The king never slept
with the same..."</i>

45:25.654 --> 45:27.187
...same woman twice.

45:27.189 --> 45:29.056
When I was brought
to his room,

45:29.058 --> 45:31.025
he laid out two lines

45:31.027 --> 45:33.060
of the finest cocaine.

45:35.732 --> 45:37.531
<i>When I was brought
to his room,</i>

45:37.533 --> 45:41.171
he laid out
the most miraculous panties.

45:42.605 --> 45:44.038
<i>"Knickers."</i>

45:44.040 --> 45:45.075
Knickers.

45:46.542 --> 45:47.607
<i>"Worth a fortune."</i>

45:47.609 --> 45:49.011
...fortune.

45:50.279 --> 45:52.516
They were
absolutely weightless.

46:00.089 --> 46:02.156
Six weeks later,
there was a revolution,

46:02.158 --> 46:04.025
and the king was dead
within a year.

46:04.027 --> 46:07.197
And soon, Keith,
you'll be king, too.

46:30.752 --> 46:32.622
If London is a spider web,

46:33.522 --> 46:35.388
maybe I'm the fly.

46:35.390 --> 46:36.559
Did you write that?

46:37.493 --> 46:38.491
In my book?

46:38.493 --> 46:39.528
Mmm-hmm.

46:40.462 --> 46:42.295
To tell you the truth,
I feel pretty good

46:42.297 --> 46:43.667
about my writing right now.

46:44.734 --> 46:46.737
I think I'm doing
the best work of my life.

46:47.669 --> 46:49.005
I picked up your book.

46:50.272 --> 46:51.672
<i>Memoirs of a Listener.</i>

46:51.674 --> 46:54.208
Yeah, let's change the subject.
How about that?

46:54.210 --> 46:56.747
I'm not one of your
one-dimensional characters, Sam.

46:57.747 --> 46:59.212
You've got to get that.

46:59.214 --> 47:00.480
I'm pretty worried
that the critics

47:00.482 --> 47:03.185
are gonna call you
a male fantasy figure.

47:04.719 --> 47:06.223
I know your secret.

47:08.290 --> 47:09.426
You do?

47:10.359 --> 47:11.395
And what is it?

47:27.477 --> 47:29.413
I'll race you
to the finish line.

47:31.147 --> 47:32.282
Correction.

47:33.315 --> 47:34.683
You go first, I go second.

47:38.553 --> 47:40.189
Remember, I have to write it.

47:43.558 --> 47:45.592
<i>I'm not in love with her.</i>

47:45.594 --> 47:48.265
<i>Something intertwines us,
but it isn't love.</i>

47:49.431 --> 47:51.368
<i>With Nicola,
it's the other thing.</i>

47:52.301 --> 47:53.303
<i>It's death.</i>

47:56.906 --> 47:59.272
<i>There's no language for pain</i>

47:59.274 --> 48:01.110
<i>except bad language.</i>

48:03.478 --> 48:06.179
<i>The single pill in the bottle.</i>

48:06.181 --> 48:08.317
<i>That's for when the living
will envy the dead.</i>

48:10.352 --> 48:12.688
<i>That's for the most
painful condition of all.</i>

48:13.756 --> 48:14.825
<i>Life.</i>

48:17.826 --> 48:19.627
<i>Hello, mate. Mark.</i>

48:19.629 --> 48:22.495
<i>Um... I finished
your book, and er,</i>

48:22.497 --> 48:26.500
<i>I've got to say
I so admire your nerve.</i>

48:26.502 --> 48:28.839
<i>The endless contortions
of your prose,</i>

48:29.739 --> 48:31.071
<i>so brave.</i>

48:31.073 --> 48:34.208
<i>You know, an autobiography
is, uh, most of the time,</i>

48:34.210 --> 48:35.408
<i>just success stories.</i>

48:35.410 --> 48:39.279
<i>For a man to take up his pen
and tell a story</i>

48:39.281 --> 48:43.419
<i>of continual failure.
Just so bloody brave.</i>

48:44.620 --> 48:47.721
<i>Sales, success, and money
and acclaim,</i>

48:47.723 --> 48:49.190
<i>they're not the measure
of an artist.</i>

48:49.192 --> 48:50.894
<i>No, really, well done, mate.</i>

48:53.629 --> 48:55.495
- <i>Hello?</i>
- <i>Guy?</i>

48:55.497 --> 48:57.864
I'm sorry
but I can't see you any more.

48:57.866 --> 48:59.632
<i>It's just too hard for me.</i>

48:59.634 --> 49:02.435
I just don't trust myself
when I'm with you.

49:02.437 --> 49:04.807
- <i>This has to be goodbye.</i>
- Nicola, you can't.

49:06.776 --> 49:07.908
You can't. It's not fair.

49:07.910 --> 49:09.976
I could never accept
your money.

49:09.978 --> 49:12.245
<i>And please, don't worry
about my friends in need.</i>

49:12.247 --> 49:13.948
Nicola, stop it.

49:13.950 --> 49:15.748
All right? Stop it. You have to...
you have to let me help you.

49:15.750 --> 49:17.520
- Sorry. Goodbye.
- <i>Nicola.</i>

49:32.902 --> 49:35.338
- <i>Keith.</i>
- <i>I'm desperate.</i>

49:36.439 --> 49:40.810
Where's the fucking money...

49:41.710 --> 49:43.245
in that?

49:49.352 --> 49:51.687
Are you doing me, young lady?

49:53.256 --> 49:54.424
Huh?

49:55.390 --> 49:58.694
Are you having me for a cunt?

50:00.029 --> 50:01.661
'Cause I'm not having that.

50:01.663 --> 50:03.700
- Keith.
- I'm not having that.

50:04.600 --> 50:07.671
<i>The money is coming.
Trust me.</i>

50:08.536 --> 50:10.506
I'm very good at this.

50:14.442 --> 50:16.009
Go and see Guy.

50:16.011 --> 50:17.810
Tell him this.

50:17.812 --> 50:20.614
Tell him I'm pale and drawn
and pining away.

50:20.616 --> 50:22.549
And that I sit, staring
at the beautiful globe,

50:22.551 --> 50:24.654
crying, and that
I'm selling off all my things.

50:25.654 --> 50:26.855
Get out.

50:35.064 --> 50:36.399
Hello, Keith.

50:38.366 --> 50:40.500
Now, listen, mate,
I just popped round Nicola's,

50:40.502 --> 50:42.969
and between you and me,
it don't look too shrewd, mate.

50:42.971 --> 50:45.071
Yeah, says to me,
"Don't fix this.

50:45.073 --> 50:46.674
"Don't fix that.
It's not important.

50:46.676 --> 50:48.011
What's the point?
There's no point."

50:49.411 --> 50:50.614
Says she's leaving London.

50:57.053 --> 50:58.986
Yeah. Goin' to some place
with poppies

50:58.988 --> 51:00.487
and drug lords or something.

51:00.489 --> 51:01.922
Y-Y-You don't think
she's gonna do that...

51:01.924 --> 51:04.391
All this, mate,
it's too much.

51:04.393 --> 51:05.792
I've never seen her so down.

51:05.794 --> 51:08.062
You know?
She just sits there,

51:08.064 --> 51:10.397
spinning that little
globe thing.

51:10.399 --> 51:12.368
As though she's been having
a bit of a cry.

51:13.069 --> 51:15.471
I'm worried she might
do herself an injury.

51:28.817 --> 51:30.919
I had a chill
run through me today.

51:35.457 --> 51:37.393
It's the feeling of life
leaving me.

51:38.828 --> 51:40.794
My breath was shallow,

51:40.796 --> 51:42.732
and my heartbeat
was really faint.

51:44.366 --> 51:46.803
I guess I'm quitting,
whether I like it or not.

51:47.669 --> 51:49.638
But goddammit, I can't go yet.

51:50.806 --> 51:52.909
I still don't know
who you are.

51:59.381 --> 52:00.649
But you know me.

52:06.788 --> 52:08.357
It's in my diaries.

52:09.058 --> 52:10.760
I know you're beautiful.

52:13.462 --> 52:15.864
And that the entire world
falls into you...

52:16.899 --> 52:18.902
and does anything you want.

52:20.969 --> 52:22.571
I mean, look at me.

52:23.506 --> 52:24.574
And look at you.

52:25.473 --> 52:27.643
I have no idea what it's like.

52:29.511 --> 52:30.979
I can't imagine it.

52:33.748 --> 52:35.417
You just don't understand.

52:37.685 --> 52:38.721
Look at me.

52:42.056 --> 52:43.125
Really?

52:46.928 --> 52:47.997
Look at me.

52:53.102 --> 52:54.370
No, it...

53:22.832 --> 53:24.565
As you don't have
any living family member

53:24.567 --> 53:27.003
to advise you,
I can't allow you to do this.

53:28.803 --> 53:30.170
- What's this?
- Nothing.

53:30.172 --> 53:32.172
You're leaving tomorrow?

53:32.174 --> 53:34.477
- I can't let you do that.
- I'm sorry, Guy.

53:36.212 --> 53:37.844
It's a bloody good thing
you did, all right,

53:37.846 --> 53:39.882
because I'm
absolutely furious.

53:41.783 --> 53:45.118
You have to take
this money, all right?

53:45.120 --> 53:46.219
You have to.

53:46.221 --> 53:48.187
- I couldn't.
- You have to.

53:48.189 --> 53:49.755
I couldn't.

53:49.757 --> 53:50.924
<i>As a little girl,
Nicola did have</i>

53:50.926 --> 53:53.092
<i>a best friend named Enola Gay.</i>

53:53.094 --> 53:54.531
<i>They were inseparable.</i>

53:55.665 --> 53:58.165
<i>Enola shared in all
of Nicola's schemes</i>

53:58.167 --> 54:00.067
<i>in domestic terrorism.</i>

54:00.069 --> 54:02.236
<i>But the thing about Enola was</i>

54:02.238 --> 54:05.205
<i>she came from inside the head
of Nicola Six.</i>

54:07.209 --> 54:09.208
It's too much for me.

54:09.210 --> 54:11.210
It's too much for me.

54:11.212 --> 54:15.051

Stop it.

Stop it.

56:23.779 --> 56:25.181
You know it has to.

56:26.314 --> 56:27.948
It has to happen

56:27.950 --> 56:29.185
at least once.

56:30.352 --> 56:32.355
You see, I can't.

56:37.091 --> 56:38.327
I can.

56:57.212 --> 56:59.015

57:27.875 --> 57:28.877
Truthfully.

57:33.948 --> 57:37.653
The truth is
you're a bad dream.

57:39.388 --> 57:42.422
I keep thinking I'll wake up
and you'll disappear.

57:42.424 --> 57:44.861
You're so alone, Sam.

57:51.299 --> 57:53.435
Why am I
the only person with you?

58:01.375 --> 58:04.113
People don't like
to see life fading away.

58:22.196 --> 58:24.232
<i>It's a once in a lifetime...</i>

58:45.386 --> 58:47.888
Yes?

58:47.890 --> 58:50.357
- Good afternoon. I'm your new social worker.
- Where's Mrs. Ovens?

58:50.359 --> 58:52.558
Is your husband
at home at the moment?

58:52.560 --> 58:55.060
Yes. He's not been
well though. He's...

58:55.062 --> 58:56.495
I'm sure you're aware

58:56.497 --> 58:58.265
of the dangers
of passive smoking?

58:58.267 --> 59:00.366
I've been passively
smoking for years

59:00.368 --> 59:02.301
and it hasn't
done me any harm.

59:02.303 --> 59:04.504
- I'm afraid I might have to seek an order.
- Order?

59:04.506 --> 59:06.205
What?

59:06.207 --> 59:08.975
I know we haven't got what
some do, but we are trying.

59:08.977 --> 59:10.576
Yeah, you tell her, Kath.

59:10.578 --> 59:12.978
- You come in here...
- You haven't got any money.

59:12.980 --> 59:14.948
Certainly not
enough for proper care.

59:14.950 --> 59:17.951
There is nothing I wouldn't do
for my daughter!

59:17.953 --> 59:20.219
My God.
Do you abuse your daughter?

59:20.221 --> 59:23.290
And I can't say I like the look of that dog.

59:23.292 --> 59:26.359
Oi! No-one talks
about my dog like that!

59:26.361 --> 59:28.929
You fuck off out of it!

59:28.931 --> 59:30.596
What kind of care
do you give people

59:30.598 --> 59:32.232
from an office?

59:32.234 --> 59:35.868
Get out, you evil witch!

59:35.870 --> 59:38.273
- Get the fuck out!
- Good day.

59:40.975 --> 59:42.844
You don't let her touch you.

59:44.413 --> 59:47.550
You are who you are.
All right?

59:57.491 --> 01:00:00.897
You know I'm gonna
fucking kill you, don't you?

01:00:01.596 --> 01:00:02.998
Shall we say 8:00?

01:00:11.172 --> 01:00:14.207
<i>This is London.
There are no fields,</i>

01:00:14.209 --> 01:00:17.547
<i>only fields of operation
and observation.</i>

01:00:24.285 --> 01:00:25.387
Sorry?

01:00:27.288 --> 01:00:28.924
I didn't say anything.

01:00:35.464 --> 01:00:37.029
<i>The human being
can formulate</i>

<i>a strategy for death.</i>

01:00:38.366 --> 01:00:40.333
<i>Gentle or defiant.</i>

01:00:40.335 --> 01:00:42.101
<i>But then death
moves in completely</i>

01:00:42.103 --> 01:00:43.303
<i>and decides
to run the show</i>

01:00:43.305 --> 01:00:44.973
<i>at some point
near the end.</i>

01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:48.641
<i>Nicola wasn't having
any of that.</i>

01:00:48.643 --> 01:00:50.377
<i>She would be
running things right up</i>

01:00:50.379 --> 01:00:52.081
<i>to the very last second.</i>

01:00:54.116 --> 01:00:55.348
You know,
I'm looking forward

01:00:55.350 --> 01:00:56.518
to the eclipse.

01:00:57.551 --> 01:00:58.618
It's on my birthday.

01:00:58.620 --> 01:01:02.058
No, no, no, no, no.

01:01:04.326 --> 01:01:07.226
You shouldn't have come
to my place.

01:01:07.228 --> 01:01:10.163
Never should have done that.

01:01:10.165 --> 01:01:11.901
Now I know why.

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:14.636
You didn't want me
to see how you live.

01:01:16.238 --> 01:01:17.937
You live like a pig.

01:01:17.939 --> 01:01:20.373
That is so fucking
out of order!

01:01:20.375 --> 01:01:23.212
Sixty thousand Pounds.

01:01:26.247 --> 01:01:28.547
That's more than you need

01:01:28.549 --> 01:01:31.150
so that you could take care
of all your other troubles

01:01:31.152 --> 01:01:32.551
and clear your mind,

01:01:32.553 --> 01:01:34.289
<i>for what's really important.</i>

01:01:36.457 --> 01:01:37.623
The big one.

01:01:37.625 --> 01:01:39.091
The big one.

01:01:39.093 --> 01:01:40.493
Yes.

01:01:40.495 --> 01:01:42.395
TV stardom.

01:01:42.397 --> 01:01:44.397
Televised?

01:01:44.399 --> 01:01:46.234
See, that's where you belong.

01:01:47.169 --> 01:01:51.007
That is where everything
that you want is.

01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:53.509
Including me.

01:01:54.977 --> 01:01:56.045
All right?

01:01:58.480 --> 01:01:59.949
You can have a taste now.

01:02:03.718 --> 01:02:07.522
I said... a taste.

01:02:08.522 --> 01:02:09.691
A taste.

01:02:12.727 --> 01:02:14.027

Not-so-nice things

01:03:45.821 --> 01:03:47.256
Hey, listen.

01:03:48.489 --> 01:03:51.091
There's no need for that. Look,
look, look, I got the money.

01:03:51.093 --> 01:03:53.426
Look. It's right there.
I even got extra for ya.

01:03:53.428 --> 01:03:56.562
- There's even extra in there.
- Go on, love. Have a look.

01:03:56.564 --> 01:03:58.565
- Extra?
- Yeah.

01:03:58.567 --> 01:04:01.266
- Count it.
- It's all there.

01:04:01.268 --> 01:04:02.337
What?

01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:08.875
You're a smart man.

01:04:08.877 --> 01:04:11.344
You're a smart fucking man
to bring extra.

01:04:11.346 --> 01:04:14.313
Read all about it.

01:04:14.315 --> 01:04:16.516
I'm fucking proud of you.

01:04:16.518 --> 01:04:18.551
Go on, son. Have it.

01:04:18.553 --> 01:04:21.656
Have a bang on that. Fuckin' take it!

01:04:24.493 --> 01:04:27.129
<i>I feel like
I owe you an apology.</i>

01:04:28.462 --> 01:04:30.496
I want to see a man

01:04:30.498 --> 01:04:32.531
that can handle
his fucking drugs.

01:04:32.533 --> 01:04:33.732
Don't disappoint.

01:04:33.734 --> 01:04:35.768
- I really need a hug.
- A hug?

01:04:38.473 --> 01:04:41.406
- 'Cause the fucking floor's...
- Want me to hold you or something?

01:04:41.408 --> 01:04:43.576
You looked
after me, didn't you?

01:04:43.578 --> 01:04:44.780
I'll tell you why.

01:04:46.747 --> 01:04:49.651
You're such a sweet,
sweet fucking boy.

01:04:51.386 --> 01:04:53.486
- Chick, Chick, Chick.
- Look, look, look at me.

01:04:53.488 --> 01:04:55.254
Look at me.

01:04:55.256 --> 01:04:57.190
- There's no one else here.
- What?

01:04:57.192 --> 01:04:58.790
It's just you and me, man.

01:04:58.792 --> 01:05:00.527
Go on, open your eyes.

01:05:00.529 --> 01:05:02.428
- I got the fucking money.
- Open your eyes.

01:05:02.430 --> 01:05:04.667
- Fucking God. I had a bag of money.
- Where you want it?

01:05:05.799 --> 01:05:07.400
- Cock?
- No, not the cock.

01:05:07.402 --> 01:05:10.670
Is his name Jesus?
Tell me now.

01:05:10.672 --> 01:05:12.804
- Is your cock's name Jesus?
- What?

01:05:12.806 --> 01:05:15.574
- Chick, it is now.
- It is now?

01:05:15.576 --> 01:05:16.909
Jesus fucking Christ.

01:05:16.911 --> 01:05:18.511
And he was nailed
to the fucking cross.

01:05:18.513 --> 01:05:20.312
- That's right.
- That's a nail.

01:05:20.314 --> 01:05:22.281
I did it all for you.
Everything I've done.

01:05:26.821 --> 01:05:29.254
On my face.

01:05:48.877 --> 01:05:49.875
<i>It's the sort of darts</i>

01:05:49.877 --> 01:05:51.978
<i>that Robin Hood
would be proud of.</i>

01:05:56.817 --> 01:05:58.451
I understand
that in years past

01:05:58.453 --> 01:05:59.986
you threw number three
for the pub, Keith.

01:05:59.988 --> 01:06:01.788
Then boof!
Here you are

01:06:01.790 --> 01:06:04.424
on a winning streak,
a contender for the throne.

01:06:04.426 --> 01:06:06.326
Yeah, that's right.
It's very sweet, Tony.

01:06:06.328 --> 01:06:08.460
You know, uh, the pub's
two top darters,

01:06:08.462 --> 01:06:10.529
uh, Duane Kensal
and Alex O'Boye,

01:06:10.531 --> 01:06:12.167
were defeated by me
very recently.

01:06:15.337 --> 01:06:16.868
<i>So the Duoshare comes round,</i>

01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:18.737
<i>and, you know, it's given
me game a spirit, like.</i>

01:06:18.739 --> 01:06:20.676
You see,
I'm oozing confidence.

01:06:23.611 --> 01:06:25.346
May Lady Luck
smile on you, Keith.

01:06:26.247 --> 01:06:27.282
Right.

01:06:35.489 --> 01:06:37.857
<i>There's something about
Keith when he's in this mood.</i>

01:06:37.859 --> 01:06:40.359
<i>He's so confident.
He's got talent, sure,</i>

01:06:40.361 --> 01:06:41.828
<i>but that swagger,</i>

01:06:41.830 --> 01:06:43.629
<i>how long can he keep it?</i>

01:06:43.631 --> 01:06:45.700
<i>And how far will it take him?</i>

01:06:54.042 --> 01:06:55.174
<i>Some say there's gonna be</i>

01:06:55.176 --> 01:06:58.379
<i>a Chick Purchase rendezvous
a la darts.</i>

01:07:00.948 --> 01:07:02.281
<i>Fuck him.</i>

01:07:02.283 --> 01:07:04.484
<i>Oh.</i>

01:07:04.486 --> 01:07:07.522
<i>Uh, we apologize sincerely
for the language.</i>

01:07:16.964 --> 01:07:18.297
<i>I can't believe</i>

01:07:18.299 --> 01:07:19.565
<i>it has taken me this long</i>

01:07:19.567 --> 01:07:22.567
<i>to realize why I felt
so strange in your place,</i>

01:07:22.569 --> 01:07:25.370
<i>and it's because
I've kind of done this.</i>

01:07:25.372 --> 01:07:26.906
<i>I could've been you before.</i>

01:07:26.908 --> 01:07:28.775
<i>It's a character
I wrote in my third novel,</i>

01:07:28.777 --> 01:07:30.009
Crossbone Waters.

01:07:30.011 --> 01:07:34.480
<i>And for all intents
and purposes, it was you.</i>

01:07:34.482 --> 01:07:35.948
<i>And I cut him in the end.</i>

01:07:35.950 --> 01:07:38.417
<i>The character was just too,
too depressing.</i>

01:07:38.419 --> 01:07:40.719
<i>Just couldn't find
any truth in him.</i>

01:07:40.721 --> 01:07:42.888
<i>You're not frightened to face
the truth, are you, Samson?</i>

01:07:42.890 --> 01:07:44.623
<i>Don't be.
It doesn't serve you.</i>

01:07:44.625 --> 01:07:45.991
<i>It won't help.</i>

01:07:45.993 --> 01:07:47.926
<i>Anyway, who am I
to give advice?</i>

01:07:47.928 --> 01:07:50.062
<i>Just 'cause I've
sold a few more books than you.</i>

01:07:50.064 --> 01:07:51.864
<i>What do I know
about life and art?</i>

01:08:04.346 --> 01:08:05.444
<i>Some say there's gonna be</i>

01:08:05.446 --> 01:08:07.013
<i>a Chick Purchase rendezvous...</i>

01:08:07.015 --> 01:08:09.614
I ain't playing the board,
know what I mean?

01:08:09.616 --> 01:08:10.750
Fuck him.

01:08:10.752 --> 01:08:11.951
<i>Oh.</i>

01:08:22.796 --> 01:08:23.929
<i>I'm innocent.</i>

01:08:23.930 --> 01:08:25.698
<i>That's not what I hear.</i>

01:08:25.700 --> 01:08:27.368
Oh, yeah.

01:08:34.742 --> 01:08:35.877
Keith.

01:08:36.979 --> 01:08:39.715
Do you remember what it feels
like to be punished?

01:08:44.986 --> 01:08:46.785
Come here.

01:08:46.787 --> 01:08:48.689
Oh, you know
Keith has another one now?

01:08:49.924 --> 01:08:51.694
- Really?
- Yeah, oh, yeah.

01:08:52.594 --> 01:08:54.627
Just around da corner.
The rich one.

01:08:54.629 --> 01:08:55.962
You know the one I mean.

01:08:55.964 --> 01:08:57.796
He be doing her arse off
every night.

01:08:57.799 --> 01:08:59.399
Dark personality bitch.

01:08:59.401 --> 01:09:00.868
What do you mean
I know the one?

01:09:08.475 --> 01:09:09.975
I'm innocent.

01:09:13.848 --> 01:09:16.915
See, I know you covet the bitch,
but she is his.

01:09:16.917 --> 01:09:18.019
Keith is a slayer.

01:09:19.420 --> 01:09:21.118
And one more thing,
she pays him for it.

01:09:21.121 --> 01:09:22.953
- What?
- Mmm.

01:09:22.956 --> 01:09:24.425
Keith is her toy boy.

01:09:26.094 --> 01:09:28.127
No, she has nothing
to do with Keith like that.

01:09:28.129 --> 01:09:31.567
Don't be a fool now, man.
You follow the darts?

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:36.404
<i>Nicola. It is the one.</i>

01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:47.683
"I was the only one
who ever mattered.

01:09:50.050 --> 01:09:52.120
"M.A."

01:10:14.709 --> 01:10:17.645
Nicola, you've killed me.

01:10:35.662 --> 01:10:37.433
Another writer.

01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:48.140
What happened
to your apartment?

01:10:48.142 --> 01:10:49.508
An accident.

01:10:49.510 --> 01:10:50.912
Do you want to sit down?

01:10:53.113 --> 01:10:54.683
What's wrong?

01:10:57.018 --> 01:10:58.950
Yeah,
I'll tell you what, Nicky.

01:10:58.952 --> 01:11:00.686
I'm not gonna wash that
for a month.

01:11:00.688 --> 01:11:01.987
Pure filth, that was.

01:11:01.989 --> 01:11:04.059
I'm sorry, I almost forgot
you were even here.

01:11:05.559 --> 01:11:07.192
Keith.

01:11:07.194 --> 01:11:09.561
Hey, I'll tell you what.
I'll let me self out, shall I?

01:11:09.563 --> 01:11:12.531
Thank you.
Goodnight, Keith.

01:11:12.533 --> 01:11:14.566
So, tell me...

01:11:14.568 --> 01:11:16.602
I'm so sorry, but...

01:11:16.604 --> 01:11:17.770
What were you saying?

01:11:17.772 --> 01:11:19.707
Is he... Is he here
all the time?

01:11:23.944 --> 01:11:24.947
I teach him.

01:11:25.846 --> 01:11:27.146
You...

01:11:27.148 --> 01:11:29.649
You... You teach him.
I don't understand.

01:11:29.651 --> 01:11:32.183
I mean, it's not
that he's illiterate, exactly.

01:11:32.185 --> 01:11:34.186
I mean, he's really
picking up on it.

01:11:34.188 --> 01:11:36.158
He's doing great
actually, but...

01:11:38.626 --> 01:11:39.991
You know, I gave him
his first copy

01:11:39.993 --> 01:11:41.259
of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>
the other day.

01:11:41.261 --> 01:11:43.228
- Just the other day.
- Hold on one second.

01:11:43.230 --> 01:11:44.599
Has he ever...

01:11:46.099 --> 01:11:48.102
Has he ever done
anything to you?

01:11:49.604 --> 01:11:50.936
What do you mean?

01:11:50.938 --> 01:11:52.573
Has he ever tried
to fuck you?

01:12:01.815 --> 01:12:03.785
How could you even
ask me that?

01:12:04.852 --> 01:12:08.588
I'm sorry, all right.
I'm so sorry. I just...

01:12:08.590 --> 01:12:11.691
I'm sorry. I don't know
what came over me.

01:12:11.693 --> 01:12:14.763
All right. I was just
being jealous. That's it.

01:12:20.902 --> 01:12:21.970
Nicola.

01:12:23.270 --> 01:12:24.238
Nicola.

01:12:27.041 --> 01:12:28.310
It's because I love you.

01:12:30.243 --> 01:12:31.212
That's why.

01:12:37.151 --> 01:12:38.185
I love you.

01:12:40.354 --> 01:12:41.622
I love you.

01:12:53.300 --> 01:12:56.604
<i>I just want
to protect you. I love you.</i>

01:12:57.639 --> 01:12:59.304
<i>I want you to have
the keys to my flat.</i>

01:12:59.306 --> 01:13:01.910
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:13:03.211 --> 01:13:04.746
I'll be right back.

01:13:26.867 --> 01:13:27.868
Hi.

01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:35.209
Hello.

01:13:47.455 --> 01:13:48.790
It's okay.

01:14:19.319 --> 01:14:20.788
May I touch?

01:14:21.922 --> 01:14:23.058
Yes, please.

01:14:30.497 --> 01:14:32.233
It's like a rock.

01:14:34.434 --> 01:14:35.437
Yes.

01:14:41.776 --> 01:14:43.111
<i>The kiss of death.</i>

01:14:45.078 --> 01:14:46.911
Wait, wait, wait, wait...

01:14:46.913 --> 01:14:49.749
<i>Poisons and paralyzes.</i>

01:14:49.751 --> 01:14:51.286
There's something
I haven't told you.

01:14:52.819 --> 01:14:53.822
What?

01:14:55.089 --> 01:14:56.725
I'm a virgin.

01:14:58.291 --> 01:15:01.761
Right. Okay.
Well, that's okay.

01:15:01.763 --> 01:15:04.096
Do you... Do you...
Do you want to stop?

01:15:04.098 --> 01:15:05.167
Do you think we should stop?

01:15:06.067 --> 01:15:08.804
No. No, it's okay.

01:15:16.978 --> 01:15:20.047
Oh, my God.

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:27.953
<i>Nicola often found
herself imagining</i>

01:15:27.955 --> 01:15:29.457
<i>that she was
going out with God.</i>

01:15:31.058 --> 01:15:33.325
<i>She had slept with him once.</i>

01:15:33.327 --> 01:15:36.031
<i>And once only.
Then never again.</i>

01:15:37.031 --> 01:15:39.734
<i>God cried in the street
outside her flat.</i>

01:15:41.301 --> 01:15:43.968
<i>God got Shakespeare
and Dante working</i>

01:15:43.970 --> 01:15:46.004
<i>as a team
to write her poems.</i>

01:15:46.006 --> 01:15:48.143
<i>Of course, there was
another man in Nicola's life.</i>

01:15:49.109 --> 01:15:50.277
<i>The Devil.</i>

01:15:52.846 --> 01:15:54.445
<i>Nicola gave herself
to the Devil</i>

01:15:54.447 --> 01:15:56.517
<i>because she wanted
to make God mad.</i>

01:15:57.551 --> 01:15:59.517
<i>A jealous God.</i>

01:15:59.519 --> 01:16:01.020
<i>He threatened
to wash his hands</i>

01:16:01.022 --> 01:16:02.290
<i>of the whole planet.</i>

01:16:03.825 --> 01:16:06.761
<i>He promised plague
and famine and terror.</i>

01:16:07.929 --> 01:16:11.132
<i>He threatened to make her old
and keep her that way forever.</i>

01:16:15.169 --> 01:16:17.104
<i>Nicola told him to get lost.</i>

01:16:23.144 --> 01:16:25.343
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- What, what?

01:16:25.345 --> 01:16:27.612
I just realized
something's terribly wrong.

01:16:27.614 --> 01:16:29.080
What, what, what, what?

01:16:29.082 --> 01:16:30.516
There's something
you have to do first.

01:16:30.518 --> 01:16:32.618
You want me to leave my wife?
I'll leave my wife.

01:16:32.620 --> 01:16:35.553
- I'll do it. I'll leave my wife. That's fine. That's fine.
- No, no, no, no.

01:16:35.555 --> 01:16:37.188
What, what, what?

01:16:37.190 --> 01:16:40.124
I don't want you to leave her.
I want you to tell her.

01:16:40.126 --> 01:16:42.293
It's bad enough
what we're doing.

01:16:42.295 --> 01:16:44.230
It could harm her more
if she doesn't know.

01:16:44.232 --> 01:16:45.500
You want me to...

01:16:46.466 --> 01:16:48.267
- Okay?
- You want me to...

01:16:48.269 --> 01:16:50.071
- You want me to tell my wife?
- Okay?

01:16:52.406 --> 01:16:55.076
Okay. Okay, that's fine.

01:16:55.977 --> 01:16:57.011
Okay, that's fine.

01:16:59.013 --> 01:17:00.215
Okay.

01:17:02.015 --> 01:17:03.515
Okay, that's fine.

01:17:03.517 --> 01:17:04.885
<i>It's okay.</i>

01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:29.044
<i>Samson, Mark.</i>

01:17:30.411 --> 01:17:32.477
<i>Talk to your neighbors.
Get in there.</i>

01:17:32.479 --> 01:17:34.482
<i>I would. Well, I did.</i>

01:17:51.431 --> 01:17:53.635
<i>This was
the fifth of November.</i>

01:17:55.403 --> 01:17:57.305
<i>This was horror day.</i>

01:18:02.410 --> 01:18:04.312
<i>I wasn't in love with Nicola.</i>

01:18:07.581 --> 01:18:10.115
<i>Something intertwined us...</i>

01:18:10.117 --> 01:18:11.085
<i>but it wasn't love.</i>

01:18:15.055 --> 01:18:17.125
<i>With Nicola,
it was the other thing.</i>

01:18:21.996 --> 01:18:23.064
<i>Death.</i>

01:18:40.046 --> 01:18:41.248
Happy birthday.

01:19:14.081 --> 01:19:15.317
Did he, uh...

01:19:18.219 --> 01:19:19.487
Did he love you?

01:19:28.261 --> 01:19:30.465
Did Mark write about you?

01:19:36.303 --> 01:19:37.604
He was afraid of me.

01:19:43.243 --> 01:19:44.746
He found a way to escape.

01:19:46.179 --> 01:19:47.715
Without the story.

01:19:48.648 --> 01:19:50.317
Without being in the story.

01:20:15.142 --> 01:20:17.144
This is the dress
of my dreams.

01:20:25.519 --> 01:20:27.820
<i>Unofficial
declaration of war.</i>

01:20:27.822 --> 01:20:29.253
<i>A nuclear...</i>

01:20:29.255 --> 01:20:32.758
<i>Where the undefeated
Chick Purchase</i>

01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:35.793
<i>will play the eighth seed
Keith Talent</i>

01:20:35.795 --> 01:20:37.329
<i>in the Black Cross Pub.</i>

01:20:37.331 --> 01:20:40.268
<i>Good luck, Keith.
You'll need it.</i>

01:20:41.234 --> 01:20:42.401
Probably sound
more dramatic

01:20:42.403 --> 01:20:43.772
than it really is
I expect but...

01:20:46.273 --> 01:20:47.409
There's someone else.

01:20:48.408 --> 01:20:49.807
It seems to me that
there's been a need

01:20:49.809 --> 01:20:52.177
to redefine our relationship.

01:21:09.529 --> 01:21:10.764
You should have lied about it.

01:21:16.769 --> 01:21:18.839
Would you like to know
how the story ends?

01:21:20.373 --> 01:21:23.875
Or you could always imagine
whatever you want to.

01:21:23.877 --> 01:21:25.843
No matter what's going on
in the world,

01:21:25.845 --> 01:21:28.614
you can always imagine
anything you like,

01:21:28.616 --> 01:21:29.850
and It'll make you happy.

01:21:31.184 --> 01:21:32.653
Okay?

01:21:56.743 --> 01:21:57.910
Package for you, sir.

01:21:57.912 --> 01:21:59.681
Oh. Thank you.

01:22:20.501 --> 01:22:22.601
Okay, so where's
the actual pub?

01:22:22.603 --> 01:22:23.668
Pub?

01:22:23.670 --> 01:22:24.770
You know,
where's the crowd

01:22:24.772 --> 01:22:26.737
and the birds and that?

01:22:26.739 --> 01:22:28.339
We use cutaways

01:22:28.341 --> 01:22:31.375
and just slug in fake audience
reaction shots later.

01:22:31.377 --> 01:22:33.678
There's never anybody here.

01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:36.617
What you see at home
is 100 percent TV magic.

01:22:39.853 --> 01:22:41.456
<i>Love is blind.</i>

01:22:45.225 --> 01:22:47.362
<i>But it makes you see
a blind man.</i>

01:22:53.267 --> 01:22:55.769
<i>It makes you search him out
with eyes of love.</i>

01:23:03.443 --> 01:23:05.444
<i>After years of war
and revolution,</i>

01:23:05.446 --> 01:23:07.215
<i>dreams and imagination,</i>

01:23:08.415 --> 01:23:10.285
<i>love is a big idea.</i>

01:23:11.484 --> 01:23:12.750
<i>It's thought police.</i>

01:23:12.752 --> 01:23:14.889
<i>It's a knock on the door
at 3 a.m.</i>

01:23:15.788 --> 01:23:17.655
<i>Love makes you
bring on World War Three</i>

01:23:17.657 --> 01:23:18.692
<i>for a piece of ass.</i>

01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:22.427
<i>Enola Gay was
the plane that flew</i>

01:23:22.429 --> 01:23:23.631
<i>the mission to Hiroshima.</i>

01:23:25.366 --> 01:23:28.469
<i>The pilot named the aircraft
after his mother.</i>

01:23:29.970 --> 01:23:31.806
<i>He was once her little boy.</i>

01:23:32.706 --> 01:23:35.243
<i>But Little Boy was the name
of the atom bomb.</i>

01:23:36.809 --> 01:23:39.645
<i>It killed 50,000 people</i>

01:23:39.647 --> 01:23:42.250
<i>in 120 seconds.</i>

01:24:17.050 --> 01:24:18.952
Ah, there's Chick.

01:24:21.621 --> 01:24:23.855
You certainly gotta
respect his style.

01:24:23.857 --> 01:24:26.928
Well, he's got some nick,
and he's got the pull.

01:24:27.827 --> 01:24:31.429
Yeah, who's that
with him?

01:24:31.431 --> 01:24:33.432
It's Julian Neat.

01:24:33.434 --> 01:24:35.503
Agent to the darting stars.

01:24:36.937 --> 01:24:40.504
As always,
looking fabulous, Chick!

01:24:40.506 --> 01:24:42.309
Thanks ever so much.

01:24:51.117 --> 01:24:54.522
Hey, baby girl, eh.

01:24:55.421 --> 01:24:58.589
Oh, Chick, mate.

01:24:58.591 --> 01:25:02.362
Listen, let's say we forget
any past unpleasantries, eh?

01:25:03.897 --> 01:25:05.963
What is a stunner
of this stature doing

01:25:05.965 --> 01:25:08.335
with a fucking trog like you?

01:25:09.068 --> 01:25:10.401
Eh?

01:25:10.403 --> 01:25:13.571
Seriously! The mind boggles.

01:25:13.573 --> 01:25:19.410
What is it, narcissistic
personality disorder or...

01:25:19.412 --> 01:25:21.413
Ah, got it.

01:25:21.415 --> 01:25:24.719
Likes to be watched. Eh?

01:25:26.553 --> 01:25:28.820
I love
to be watched.

01:25:28.822 --> 01:25:30.491
I would too,
if I was her.

01:25:31.392 --> 01:25:33.894
Innit, Keithy? Or is it not?

01:25:35.461 --> 01:25:36.927
Okay, you lot.

01:25:36.929 --> 01:25:38.700
Pre-match interview.

01:25:43.537 --> 01:25:47.004
In five, four, three,
two, one.

01:25:55.515 --> 01:25:58.482
A real treat in store
for you this evening.

01:25:58.484 --> 01:26:00.886
To my right,
the one and only

01:26:00.888 --> 01:26:03.789
Chick "Cock 'o
the Walk" Purchase.

01:26:05.992 --> 01:26:08.660
And to my left,
Keith Talent.

01:26:08.662 --> 01:26:09.895
- So...
- Tony, sir,

01:26:09.897 --> 01:26:11.998
I'm Keith Talent,
"The Finisher."

01:26:13.166 --> 01:26:15.534
Right. Chick?

01:26:15.536 --> 01:26:17.002
To be quite frank,

01:26:17.004 --> 01:26:19.838
I just hope it's not too
one-sided really, you know.

01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:23.010
For the sake of the sport,
for the sake of darts, like.

01:26:24.944 --> 01:26:26.714
For Queen
and country really.

01:26:28.715 --> 01:26:30.582
Got it. Brilliant.
Thanks, lads.

01:26:30.584 --> 01:26:31.885
Thirty seconds, yeah?

01:26:32.786 --> 01:26:34.489
Looking a bit
out of sorts, Keith.

01:26:46.132 --> 01:26:48.033
<i>Keith Talent,
the young upstart</i>

01:26:48.035 --> 01:26:50.904
<i>from the Black Cross
will throw first.</i>

01:27:04.251 --> 01:27:05.784
<i>That's a fine start
from Keith.</i>

01:27:05.786 --> 01:27:07.788
<i>He's come
in with a ton 40.</i>

01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:15.026
- All right, Chick.
- Come on, Chick.

01:27:15.028 --> 01:27:18.166
<i>But what does
the maestro have?</i>

01:27:19.899 --> 01:27:21.701
<i>What a star he is.</i>

01:27:22.635 --> 01:27:25.003
<i>Whoa! You can say
you don't believe it,</i>

01:27:25.005 --> 01:27:26.070
<i>but there we go.</i>

01:27:26.072 --> 01:27:27.774
<i>That's how to start
a game of darts.</i>

01:27:31.778 --> 01:27:33.147
Get on with it.

01:27:34.915 --> 01:27:37.214
<i>There's one.
There's two.</i>

01:27:37.216 --> 01:27:39.551
<i>And Chick is...
What's Chick doing?</i>

01:27:39.553 --> 01:27:40.988
<i>He's toying with him.</i>

01:27:42.755 --> 01:27:43.890
What a shock.

01:27:45.024 --> 01:27:47.995
<i>Oh! That is
a schoolboy error.</i>

01:27:51.697 --> 01:27:53.231
<i>This is man against boy.</i>

01:27:53.233 --> 01:27:55.901
<i>This is boy against man.</i>

01:27:55.903 --> 01:27:58.973
Whipline throw from Purchase.
Get your darts out.

01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:08.547
<i>Can he keep it together</i>

01:28:08.549 --> 01:28:10.785
<i>on the biggest stage
of his life?</i>

01:28:15.255 --> 01:28:17.588
<i>Well, he's getting
a bit finished off here.</i>

01:28:17.590 --> 01:28:19.758
<i>I'm not sure
he's really concentrating.</i>

01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:21.596
<i>I'm not sure his mind's here.</i>

01:28:24.797 --> 01:28:26.897
<i>He's responded
remarkably well</i>

01:28:26.899 --> 01:28:29.036
<i>with that treble 20
to start off the leg.</i>

01:28:30.037 --> 01:28:31.869
Nicola.

01:28:31.871 --> 01:28:33.204
- I have.
- Nicola.

01:28:33.206 --> 01:28:34.940
What?

01:28:34.942 --> 01:28:36.941
I think you should
come home with me now.

01:28:36.943 --> 01:28:38.310
Please.

01:28:39.746 --> 01:28:40.878
Nicola.

01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:43.013
I think you should
come home with me.

01:28:43.015 --> 01:28:44.585
Oh, don't be
ridiculous.

01:28:47.287 --> 01:28:48.719
Come with me!

01:28:51.925 --> 01:28:54.258
Hey, don't be a cunt!

01:28:54.260 --> 01:28:56.695
Hey, it's game over, mate.

01:28:56.697 --> 01:28:59.964
Yeah, yeah.
It's fucking game over.

01:28:59.966 --> 01:29:01.301
Please, all right?

01:29:02.269 --> 01:29:03.905
She's coming home with me.

01:29:06.139 --> 01:29:08.873
She's coming home with me.

01:29:08.875 --> 01:29:11.276
Yeah, for more of
what she got last night.

01:29:15.114 --> 01:29:16.216
Fuck off.

01:29:23.389 --> 01:29:27.625
Yeah. Ain't that right,
girl. Eh?

01:29:27.627 --> 01:29:28.763
Hardly.

01:29:56.355 --> 01:29:58.192
<i>Keith, are you with us?</i>

01:30:32.091 --> 01:30:34.828
<i>Of all the forces,
love is the strangest.</i>

01:30:35.862 --> 01:30:38.797
<i>Love can make a woman
pick up a bus,</i>

01:30:38.799 --> 01:30:41.636
<i>or can crush a man
under the weight of a feather.</i>

01:30:42.803 --> 01:30:44.369
<i>Or it just lets
everything go on</i>

01:30:44.371 --> 01:30:45.940
<i>as if it was yesterday...</i>

01:30:48.207 --> 01:30:49.809
<i>and will be tomorrow.</i>

01:30:53.345 --> 01:30:55.813
<i>Samson, Mark.</i>

01:30:55.815 --> 01:30:57.852
<i>Slightly in my cups,
so I'm gonna...</i>

01:30:59.019 --> 01:31:01.386
<i>say some
uncomfortable things, mate.</i>

01:31:01.388 --> 01:31:05.155
<i>I know you're envious
on some level of me.</i>

01:31:05.157 --> 01:31:08.128
<i>Many levels, probably.
And I can't blame you.</i>

01:31:09.295 --> 01:31:10.994
<i>But here's the thing.</i>

01:31:10.996 --> 01:31:13.798
<i>It doesn't matter.</i>

01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:16.868
<i>It doesn't matter
what anyone writes anymore.</i>

01:31:16.870 --> 01:31:20.038
<i>The time for it mattering
has passed.</i>

01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:23.173
<i>Truth doesn't matter anymore</i>

01:31:23.175 --> 01:31:26.080
<i>and is not wanted.</i>

01:31:27.514 --> 01:31:29.717
<i>Lower the flag, mate.</i>

01:31:31.283 --> 01:31:32.420
<i>Anyway.</i>

01:31:33.987 --> 01:31:36.357
<i>See ya.</i>

01:32:04.117 --> 01:32:05.119
Keith!

01:32:12.526 --> 01:32:13.493
I'm gonna do her.

01:32:16.429 --> 01:32:18.065
I'm gonna
fucking do her.

01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:21.566
Eh, look what
she's done to me!

01:32:21.568 --> 01:32:23.000
Look what
she's done to me!

01:32:23.002 --> 01:32:24.401
Oh, you want some?

01:32:24.403 --> 01:32:27.271
Oh, you fucking
want some, do ya?

01:32:27.273 --> 01:32:29.209
Come on. Eh?

01:32:30.277 --> 01:32:32.977
Come on then!
Fucking come on then!

01:33:34.174 --> 01:33:36.274
- I lost it.
- I know.

01:33:36.276 --> 01:33:39.246
I lost it.
I lost it.

01:33:40.313 --> 01:33:42.146
Could you take him
to Thatcher Tower,

01:33:42.148 --> 01:33:43.414
Golborne Road.

01:33:43.416 --> 01:33:44.915
If you could help him
upstairs, please,

01:33:44.917 --> 01:33:46.219
if you don't mind?

01:33:59.532 --> 01:34:01.168
Look what
she's done to me.

01:34:04.069 --> 01:34:05.872
Just get out
of the car, Guy.

01:34:07.239 --> 01:34:09.042
Look at what
she's done to me!

01:34:11.111 --> 01:34:12.576
I want you
to listen to me.

01:34:12.578 --> 01:34:14.247
Get out
of the car.

01:34:26.926 --> 01:34:30.130
Look what
she's done to me, Sam.

01:34:59.158 --> 01:35:01.258
<i>This is a true story,
but I can't believe</i>

01:35:01.260 --> 01:35:02.360
<i>it's really happening.</i>

01:35:02.362 --> 01:35:05.596
<i>♪ I go out walking ♪</i>

01:35:05.598 --> 01:35:07.401
<i>It's a murder story too.</i>

01:35:10.470 --> 01:35:12.206
<i>I can't believe my luck.</i>

01:35:14.273 --> 01:35:16.676
<i>It's a love story,
of all strange things.</i>

01:35:19.179 --> 01:35:20.480
<i>I know the murderer.</i>

01:35:23.515 --> 01:35:25.118
<i>I know the murderee.</i>

01:35:27.620 --> 01:35:29.156
<i>I know the time.</i>

01:35:30.055 --> 01:35:31.625
<i>I know the place.</i>

01:35:34.294 --> 01:35:35.528
<i>I know the motive...</i>

01:35:37.529 --> 01:35:39.332
<i>and I know the means.</i>

01:35:58.585 --> 01:35:59.553
You.

01:36:06.326 --> 01:36:07.493
Always you.

01:36:14.634 --> 01:36:16.433
<i>The equation
she was working on</i>

01:36:16.435 --> 01:36:18.205
<i>needed love in it somewhere.</i>

01:36:19.738 --> 01:36:21.407
<i>And love was dying.</i>

01:36:23.343 --> 01:36:24.674
<i>It was fixed</i>

01:36:24.676 --> 01:36:26.576
<i>from that first moment
in the Black Cross</i>

01:36:26.578 --> 01:36:29.382
<i>when she looked my way
with eyes of recognition.</i>

01:36:32.419 --> 01:36:33.420
Please.

01:36:37.090 --> 01:36:40.424
<i>I should have understood
that a cross has four points.</i>

01:36:40.426 --> 01:36:41.627
<i>Not three.</i>

01:37:12.125 --> 01:37:14.461
<i>You can't stop people
once they start.</i>

01:37:19.331 --> 01:37:22.802
<i>You can't stop people
once they start creating.</i>

01:38:23.496 --> 01:38:25.466
<i>There are two kinds of titles.</i>

01:38:26.565 --> 01:38:29.200
<i>The first kind of title
decides on a name</i>

01:38:29.202 --> 01:38:30.871
<i>or something
that is already there.</i>

01:38:33.273 --> 01:38:36.343
<i>The second kind of title
is present all along.</i>

01:38:38.912 --> 01:38:40.848
<i>It lives and breathes...</i>

01:38:41.947 --> 01:38:44.517
<i>or it tries, on every page.</i>

01:39:06.738 --> 01:39:09.673
<i>If love travels
at the speed of light,</i>

01:39:09.675 --> 01:39:11.209
<i>then it can have other powers</i>

01:39:11.211 --> 01:39:13.280
<i>just on the edge
of the possible.</i>

01:39:15.215 --> 01:39:18.385
<i>It can create impressions
on those left behind.</i>

01:39:20.519 --> 01:39:24.424
<i>Like a sun, trying to shine
right across the universe.</i>

01:39:25.757 --> 01:39:26.894
<i>It was me.</i>

01:39:27.794 --> 01:39:29.296
<i>Always me.</i>

01:39:30.596 --> 01:39:31.732

<i>Joining me now in the studio</i>

01:41:11.363 --> 01:41:13.698
<i>is award-winning
bestselling author,</i>

01:41:13.700 --> 01:41:14.633
<i>Mark Asprey,</i>

01:41:14.635 --> 01:41:16.933
<i>with his new novel,</i>
London Fields.

01:41:16.935 --> 01:41:19.369
<i>It's such an honor
to have you here today.</i>

01:41:19.371 --> 01:41:20.570
<i>Just for a treat
to our audience,</i>

01:41:20.572 --> 01:41:22.673
<i>could you read a little bit
from your novel?</i>

01:41:22.675 --> 01:41:23.744
<i>Certainly.</i>

01:41:25.444 --> 01:41:28.713
"After sex,
she'd whisper,

01:41:28.715 --> 01:41:29.815
"'That's what I am,

01:41:30.750 --> 01:41:32.650
"'a black hole.

01:41:32.652 --> 01:41:34.321
"Nothing can escape me.'

01:41:35.354 --> 01:41:37.687
"She had the power
of inspiring love

01:41:37.689 --> 01:41:39.123
"almost everywhere.

01:41:39.125 --> 01:41:40.691
"She received it,

01:41:40.693 --> 01:41:43.694
"was empowered by it,
and returned it,

01:41:43.696 --> 01:41:46.733
not merely negated,
but murdered."

01:41:47.767 --> 01:41:49.600
Thank you.
That was great.

01:41:49.602 --> 01:41:52.669
You know, I'm just
going through this,

01:41:52.671 --> 01:41:55.438
and i-it doesn't
sound like you.

01:41:55.440 --> 01:41:58.609
I-It... The kind of prose
it is written in,

01:41:58.611 --> 01:42:00.677
the immediacy
of the language,

01:42:00.679 --> 01:42:02.480
the whole style
of this,

01:42:02.482 --> 01:42:04.882
it feels like
a real tectonic shift

01:42:04.884 --> 01:42:06.883
that reads more
like a memoir really.

01:42:06.885 --> 01:42:08.718
This is not the voice

01:42:08.720 --> 01:42:11.054
of the Mark Asprey
that we all know.

01:42:11.056 --> 01:42:13.093
My audience, my readers...

01:42:14.093 --> 01:42:17.497
deserve this level
of authenticity.

01:42:18.797 --> 01:42:19.832
No matter what the...

01:42:20.832 --> 01:42:24.000
the cost
to me as an artist.

01:42:24.002 --> 01:42:26.003
And I'm prepared
to shoulder that.

01:42:26.005 --> 01:42:27.341
<i>Buy the book.</i>

01:42:29.474 --> 01:42:30.977
