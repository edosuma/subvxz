Don't make me come after you.

19:25.631 --> 19:28.534
{\an3}- Uh, honey, you wanna tell us
what's going on?

19:28.600 --> 19:31.203
- Yeah, why didn't you
pick up Charles' poop?

19:31.270 --> 19:32.804
That's the best part
of walking him.

19:32.871 --> 19:36.041
- I'm sorry. Being at the park
was such a nice break,

19:36.108 --> 19:38.110
I started getting tickets
on purpose.

19:38.176 --> 19:40.445
{\an3}- Aw, hon, if you needed a
break, you should've

19:40.512 --> 19:41.747
just said something.

19:41.813 --> 19:44.082
- Yeah, my teacher needs
a break all the time.

19:44.149 --> 19:45.784
He just goes in the hallway
and screams

19:45.851 --> 19:47.920
into an open locker,
then comes back.

19:47.986 --> 19:50.322
It's no big deal.
- You guys are right.

19:50.389 --> 19:52.190
I should've just
been honest with you.

19:52.257 --> 19:54.927
I'm sorry I'm gonna be spending
more time away from you.

19:54.993 --> 19:56.662
But don't worry,

19:56.728 --> 20:00.165
I'll still find a way
to be your mom.

with my homework?

before "too".

20:10.008 --> 20:11.376

the handcuffs!

20:11.443 --> 20:13.712
- I saw them first!
- Hey, you two!

20:13.779 --> 20:15.948
Knock it off!
- Hey, Mom!

20:16.014 --> 20:19.318
Why is the prisoner's favorite
punctuation mark a period?

20:19.384 --> 20:22.120
Because it marks
the end of a sentence.

Boom! Guaranteed homer.

It looks great, Lynn.

20:35.133 --> 20:37.269

my newest flea.

I call him Brad because he
lives in my pit. [laughs]
