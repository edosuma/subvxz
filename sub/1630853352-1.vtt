WEBVTT

01:22.082 --> 01:23.518
Hey, Nate, look.

01:23.561 --> 01:26.695
Look. Look to your left.
Your left.

01:26.738 --> 01:29.132
-- Other left.
-- Yeah, other left.

01:29.176 --> 01:30.960
Yeah, that's cornfields.

01:31.003 --> 01:34.659
And they go on for miles
and miles and miles.

01:39.621 --> 01:41.492
What is that voice?

03:23.420 --> 03:26.945
I'm so sorry for your loss.

03:26.989 --> 03:31.907
I have two kids myself.
Not twins, but...

03:31.950 --> 03:33.256
Thank you.

03:33.300 --> 03:35.911
Look, I know it's none
of my business,

03:35.954 --> 03:38.609
but this isn't a good deal
for you.

03:38.653 --> 03:42.047
I know Realtors that can get you
a much better price.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.617
I'm sorry.

03:46.661 --> 03:49.141
Are we going to do this or not?

03:49.185 --> 03:50.839
Or should we go somewhere else?

03:55.017 --> 03:56.279
Okay.

03:56.323 --> 03:58.281
Just sign here.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.812
Where was it that
you're moving again?

05:36.466 --> 05:38.207
Honey?

05:40.731 --> 05:42.777
We can still turn back.

05:44.822 --> 05:46.389
No.

05:51.786 --> 05:55.964
Hey, buddy, wake up.

05:57.008 --> 05:58.575
We're here.

06:00.272 --> 06:03.145
Whoa!

06:03.188 --> 06:04.755
Hey, you can look around,

06:04.799 --> 06:06.757
but I need you
to stay close, okay?

06:06.801 --> 06:08.411
-I need to be able to see you.
-Okay.

06:08.455 --> 06:09.499
All right.

06:11.632 --> 06:14.678
You know, you can watch him
too sometimes.

06:15.462 --> 06:17.202
Yeah.

06:17.246 --> 06:19.596
I never thought
I'd see this again.

06:25.820 --> 06:28.605
I have a good feeling
about this, Rach.

06:28.649 --> 06:31.347
It's going to be
a good year for us.

06:31.391 --> 06:34.263
I'm happy if you are.

06:34.306 --> 06:36.396
Don't say that.

06:36.439 --> 06:38.963
I want to make you happy.

06:39.007 --> 06:40.835
Well, that's easy.

06:40.878 --> 06:43.533
If Elliot's happy,
then I'm happy.

06:53.413 --> 06:54.762
Elliot?

06:57.982 --> 06:59.593
Elliot?

07:00.637 --> 07:02.204
Elliot.

07:02.247 --> 07:03.423
- Elliot?

07:05.294 --> 07:07.296
-- Elliot?!
-- Elliot!

07:10.386 --> 07:11.996
Mom!

07:14.042 --> 07:15.304
Elliot?

07:15.347 --> 07:17.524
You can't just run off
like that.

07:17.567 --> 07:19.134
Do you hear me?!

07:19.177 --> 07:20.614
Do you see the dangers around?

07:20.657 --> 07:22.659
Mom, you're hurting me.

07:27.708 --> 07:29.710
I'm sorry.

07:29.753 --> 07:31.233
I'm sorry, Mom.

07:32.539 --> 07:34.105
I swear.

07:35.106 --> 07:37.282
You scared me.

07:39.894 --> 07:41.983
What were you doing out here?

07:44.681 --> 07:46.596
I see.

07:46.640 --> 07:49.860
Okay. Well, we'll try
and get it fixed.

07:49.904 --> 07:51.862
I'm sorry, Mom.

08:08.792 --> 08:10.490
Oh, wait!

08:12.622 --> 08:14.058
Here. Here.

08:14.102 --> 08:17.148
- No, Mom, no.
Let's go find my room.

08:17.192 --> 08:19.455
- Okay.
I'll be there in a minute.

08:19.499 --> 08:22.806
- Yeah, kitchen.
Everything in the kitchen.

08:22.850 --> 08:24.547
It's written on the boxes.

08:24.591 --> 08:26.157
Yeah, up there.

08:26.201 --> 08:28.203
-No, no, back up.

08:28.246 --> 08:30.684
Everything up the stairs, yeah.
Thanks.

08:30.727 --> 08:32.381
I'll show you.

09:05.501 --> 09:07.851
- Rachel.

09:07.895 --> 09:09.461
What's wrong?

09:14.466 --> 09:18.427
This used to be some sort
of local rectory, so...

09:23.650 --> 09:25.477
Elliot?

09:25.521 --> 09:28.698
- Mom, come here.
I'm upstairs.

09:34.922 --> 09:35.966
Where?

09:37.272 --> 09:40.057
- Mom.

09:44.235 --> 09:45.280
Elliot?

09:50.677 --> 09:52.069
Elliot?

10:13.700 --> 10:15.223
Elliot?

10:56.090 --> 10:57.526
Elliot.

10:59.093 --> 11:00.703
You scared me.

11:00.747 --> 11:03.532
You want to give me
a heart attack?

11:03.575 --> 11:06.404
Mom, I want this to be my room.

11:08.624 --> 11:10.495
Oh. Really?

11:10.539 --> 11:11.714
Can I have it?

11:11.758 --> 11:13.585
Ah, okay.

11:13.629 --> 11:16.893
Well, why don't we talk to Dad?

11:16.937 --> 11:19.330
-- Yeah. Okay.
-- Yeah, yeah? Okay.

11:32.169 --> 11:34.476
Looks like we have guests.

11:37.522 --> 11:38.785
They left already?

11:38.828 --> 11:42.353
Yeah. Sorry.
It's a long walk home.

11:42.397 --> 11:44.834
But we got invited
to a welcome party.

11:44.878 --> 11:47.054
You'll meet them all there.

11:47.097 --> 11:48.316
Okay.

11:49.491 --> 11:50.971
All right.

11:51.014 --> 11:52.537
You know,
you can change your mind.

11:52.581 --> 11:54.714
You don't have to sleep here.

11:57.020 --> 12:01.416
Well, Dad and Mom are just
down those stairs.

12:01.459 --> 12:02.983
If you want to
come sleep with us.

12:03.026 --> 12:04.636
-Okay.
-- Okay.

12:06.029 --> 12:08.031
Big kiss.

12:08.075 --> 12:10.033
And one for Nathan too.

12:17.301 --> 12:19.608
I love you, little man.

12:21.218 --> 12:22.916
Sweet dreams.

12:24.091 --> 12:26.441
- Mom?

12:26.484 --> 12:32.360
You and Dad, do you love me
as much as you loved Nathan?

12:36.103 --> 12:38.235
Of course we do.

12:43.545 --> 12:47.157
You know that Dad and I,

12:47.201 --> 12:51.901
we really -- we really
just miss Nate right now.

12:51.945 --> 12:54.643
The same way you do.

12:56.079 --> 12:58.647
But you don't ever have to worry
about that.

13:00.127 --> 13:01.215
Okay.

13:06.611 --> 13:07.743
Hey.

13:10.267 --> 13:17.144
Do you know that you can tell me
absolutely anything?

13:17.187 --> 13:19.494
Okay.

13:19.537 --> 13:24.194
Why did we leave Nate there
in the ground?

13:24.238 --> 13:26.022
Oh, sweetheart.

13:27.719 --> 13:29.460
We didn't leave him.

13:30.505 --> 13:33.247
He is always with us.

13:33.290 --> 13:35.684
Always.

13:35.727 --> 13:37.381
Who'd we bury, then?

13:54.921 --> 13:56.226
Elliot.

13:58.054 --> 14:01.579
How do you have this?
Where did you find this?

14:07.977 --> 14:10.066
Can I keep it?

14:10.110 --> 14:12.503
Please?

14:13.635 --> 14:16.029
I'm sure he'd want you
to have it.

14:16.072 --> 14:18.509
You just take good care of it.
Okay?

14:19.859 --> 14:23.688
So now he wants a bed
for Nathan.

14:25.386 --> 14:28.432
And I may have
promised him that.

14:28.476 --> 14:31.740
Isn't that exactly what
we were not supposed to do?

14:32.523 --> 14:34.134
What's the point
of even being here

14:34.177 --> 14:35.744
if you're gonna give in to him
right away?

14:35.787 --> 14:38.573
I'm sorry.
What should I have done, then?

14:38.616 --> 14:40.923
Said, "Oh, Elliot, don't dwell
on your brother.

14:40.967 --> 14:43.273
-He's dead"?
-You know I didn't mean that.

14:45.710 --> 14:46.929
But it is what you want.

14:46.973 --> 14:48.713
- No.

14:48.757 --> 14:51.194
What I want is for us
to feel better.

14:51.238 --> 14:52.935
Good night.

16:04.572 --> 16:06.139
Hey.

16:08.489 --> 16:09.794
Hey.

16:11.057 --> 16:12.884
Come here.

16:12.928 --> 16:14.582
Come here.

16:14.625 --> 16:16.149
It's okay.

16:17.846 --> 16:19.152
It's okay.

16:21.806 --> 16:23.852
That dream again?

16:23.895 --> 16:24.984
Mm-hmm.

16:29.205 --> 16:31.033
Want to talk about it?

16:32.992 --> 16:35.342
There's nothing new to say.

16:39.737 --> 16:43.045
I'm the only one
who can hear him screaming.

16:45.656 --> 16:48.007
They all think I'm crazy.

16:49.834 --> 16:52.141
Then they try to hold me back.

16:56.667 --> 16:59.670
But I have to see him
for myself.

17:02.717 --> 17:06.199
And then when I finally
get the lid open...

17:07.678 --> 17:09.376
...and see him...

17:11.856 --> 17:13.510
Nathan?

17:17.775 --> 17:19.168
Elliot.

17:22.128 --> 17:24.130
...he's so pale...

17:26.088 --> 17:28.917
...so beautiful.

17:33.052 --> 17:36.968
I don't know what I'd do
if I lost him too.

17:50.547 --> 17:52.332
- Wait.

17:52.375 --> 17:53.898
This too.

18:49.302 --> 18:52.174
-- Hurry up!
-- Okay.

18:54.959 --> 18:56.700
-- Let's go!
-- All right.

18:56.744 --> 18:59.399
-- Mom! Dad!
-- I'm coming.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.231
Yeah, when I was a kid,

19:05.274 --> 19:07.537
my father used to take me
out here,

19:07.581 --> 19:10.714
and he said
that the red handprints

19:10.758 --> 19:15.066
were put there like thousands
and thousands of years ago

19:15.110 --> 19:16.807
by cavemen or something.

19:16.851 --> 19:20.071
And legend has it
that if you put your hand

19:20.115 --> 19:24.075
against one of the handprints
and make a wish,

19:24.119 --> 19:26.034
it'll come true.

20:15.170 --> 20:17.477
You said you wanted green.

20:17.520 --> 20:19.696
I've got the blue.

20:19.740 --> 20:20.958
Okay.

20:21.002 --> 20:23.787
Now are you ready for this?

20:23.831 --> 20:28.662
In three, two, one.

20:28.705 --> 20:31.055
Ka-splash!

20:32.840 --> 20:36.322
Oh, no!
All my cars got knocked down.

20:39.281 --> 20:40.804
I like you too.

20:40.848 --> 20:45.200
You are my best friend
in the whole entire world.

20:48.377 --> 20:49.509
-Okay.
-Hey.

20:49.552 --> 20:51.075
I crashed all your cars.

20:51.119 --> 20:54.253
I'll let you have some of them.

20:54.296 --> 20:56.037
Who are you talking to?

20:56.080 --> 20:58.126
Destruction!

20:58.169 --> 20:59.867
- Hey.

20:59.910 --> 21:01.651
Elliot?

21:02.652 --> 21:04.219
Hello?

21:04.263 --> 21:05.438
One sec.

21:32.160 --> 21:33.335
- Hey.

21:33.379 --> 21:35.642
Rach.

21:35.685 --> 21:40.168
This man is taking care of me
more than my mother, right?

21:40.211 --> 21:42.910
It's nice to meet you.

21:42.953 --> 21:45.652
-I'll be back in a minute, okay?
-Okay. Yeah.

21:57.098 --> 21:58.708
You don't like this.

22:02.364 --> 22:03.452
Excuse me?

22:03.496 --> 22:04.932
The party.

22:06.368 --> 22:07.804
I don't either.

22:07.848 --> 22:09.632
Just here to piss everyone off,
really.

22:12.069 --> 22:13.419
I'm Helen.

22:15.159 --> 22:17.074
Rachel.

22:17.118 --> 22:18.380
You speak English?

22:18.424 --> 22:20.295
Yeah.
Most folks around here do.

22:20.339 --> 22:22.993
They just don't want to.

22:23.037 --> 22:24.995
But I'm not from here.

22:26.954 --> 22:29.478
Your husband.
Wow.

22:29.522 --> 22:31.828
He's something else, isn't he?

22:31.872 --> 22:34.527
The pride of the town
with "Tip of the Spear."

22:35.354 --> 22:37.312
Oh, you think people
have read it here?

22:37.356 --> 22:41.055
Read it?
They're living it.

22:42.186 --> 22:44.101
Oh.

22:45.451 --> 22:48.105
They don't like me
talking to you.

22:50.499 --> 22:52.458
Have you seen the outside?

22:52.501 --> 22:55.286
It's quite beautiful.

22:55.330 --> 22:57.419
-No.
-Come on.

22:57.463 --> 22:59.247
I don't bite.

23:07.647 --> 23:10.214
My deepest condolences, Rachel.

23:12.347 --> 23:14.915
Such a horrible,
horrible accident.

23:15.959 --> 23:17.700
Yeah.

23:18.658 --> 23:21.443
I didn't want to stay
in that house.

23:21.487 --> 23:23.880
Everything reminded me of him.

23:25.795 --> 23:28.145
Then Anthony always wanted
to come back here

23:28.189 --> 23:32.193
and try to start writing again,
so...

23:32.236 --> 23:35.849
So it wasn't your idea
to move here.

23:37.807 --> 23:42.638
Yeah.
We made the decision together.

23:42.682 --> 23:45.989
And you're a photographer?

23:46.033 --> 23:48.949
Oh.
Well, I used to be.

23:48.992 --> 23:51.560
Oh. Well, maybe I could ask you
to take some.

23:51.604 --> 23:56.652
Oh, I, um -- I don't actually
photograph people.

23:56.696 --> 23:59.046
Uh, just architecture.

23:59.089 --> 24:02.005
Buildings, shapes,
that sort of thing.

24:02.049 --> 24:03.442
Shall we sit?

24:05.487 --> 24:09.709
You know, I-I should probably
get back to my son,

24:09.752 --> 24:10.884
but thank you.

24:10.927 --> 24:12.102
Listen.

24:14.453 --> 24:16.237
I'm not crazy.

24:16.280 --> 24:17.673
Okay?

24:19.153 --> 24:20.894
All the others are.

24:23.462 --> 24:24.767
Please.

24:28.467 --> 24:31.208
Okay.

24:34.821 --> 24:37.911
It doesn't matter.
As long as...

24:40.348 --> 24:42.350
Uh...

24:42.393 --> 24:44.570
Have you seen
where Rachel's gone?

25:01.587 --> 25:04.677
I dreamed about you, Rachel.

25:10.334 --> 25:11.858
About your son.

25:13.120 --> 25:14.513
Pardon me?

25:16.123 --> 25:18.168
He has made a wish.

25:23.130 --> 25:25.393
And it has been granted.

25:28.309 --> 25:29.919
- Rach?

25:32.313 --> 25:34.010
I must go.

25:34.054 --> 25:37.361
Please take my card.

25:37.405 --> 25:39.320
I hope to see you again.

25:41.409 --> 25:42.802
- Rach?

25:44.804 --> 25:47.110
Hey. There you are.

25:47.154 --> 25:48.329
- Hey.

25:48.372 --> 25:49.591
You were wanted.

25:49.635 --> 25:51.593
Oh, great.

26:03.126 --> 26:05.607
Because your wedding
wasn't held here...

26:06.782 --> 26:09.306
...we're celebrating it now.

26:09.350 --> 26:11.091
What does he mean by that?

26:12.092 --> 26:13.354
What?

26:13.397 --> 26:15.574
It's a ceremonial wedding swing.
Come on.

26:15.617 --> 26:17.532
- I'm not getting on that.
Absolutely not.

26:17.576 --> 26:18.925
No, I'll stay with Elliot.

26:18.968 --> 26:20.404
It's a wedding swing.

26:20.448 --> 26:22.189
Go on, Mom.

26:25.584 --> 26:28.108
Yay. All right.

26:28.151 --> 26:30.632
Okay.
When I say stop, you stop it.

26:30.676 --> 26:33.243
- Of course. They'll look
after Elliot. Don't worry.

26:52.741 --> 26:53.873
It's going too high.

26:53.916 --> 26:56.136
Please try and enjoy it.

26:56.179 --> 26:58.225
Just hold on.
It's okay.

27:06.320 --> 27:08.496
Anthony, I don't like this.

27:08.539 --> 27:11.238
It's fine!
It's okay!

27:26.166 --> 27:28.472
Nate.

27:31.737 --> 27:33.303
Elliot.

27:35.088 --> 27:36.611
-- It's fine.
-Elliot!

27:36.655 --> 27:38.482
Elliot's fine.

27:38.526 --> 27:40.093
Elliot!

27:40.136 --> 27:42.225
Where did he go?

27:42.269 --> 27:44.053
Elliot!

27:49.711 --> 27:51.060
Elliot!

27:55.064 --> 27:57.458
- Hey.

27:57.501 --> 27:59.895
Rach?

27:59.939 --> 28:02.028
Stop the swing!
Rach?

28:02.071 --> 28:03.159
It's okay.

28:03.203 --> 28:05.553
Stop the swing!
Hurry up!

28:33.929 --> 28:38.499
- Mom.
You found me.

28:38.542 --> 28:40.631
- Don't ever run off
like that again.

28:40.675 --> 28:43.243
Promise?

28:43.286 --> 28:46.899
I want to sleep in my own bed.

28:48.378 --> 28:51.120
This is your bed, silly.

28:52.818 --> 28:54.994
Okay.

28:55.037 --> 28:56.517
Good night.

29:04.438 --> 29:06.092
I should have warned you
something like that

29:06.135 --> 29:07.833
might have happened.

29:07.876 --> 29:11.488
These people have just been
waiting for us for so long.

29:11.532 --> 29:14.709
Waiting for you, not us.

29:14.753 --> 29:17.625
I get it.
You're still angry with me.

29:17.668 --> 29:21.237
I'm not angry at you.
I'm angry at us.

29:21.281 --> 29:24.327
I left Elliot
with complete strangers.

29:40.213 --> 29:46.132
Don't you think it's weird
that he won't say where he was?

29:47.829 --> 29:50.049
That's what kids do.

29:50.092 --> 29:52.355
No.

29:52.399 --> 29:55.358
Not Elliot.

29:55.402 --> 29:57.796
At least not before.

30:04.846 --> 30:06.500
What do you mean?

30:12.549 --> 30:16.597
Haven't you noticed anything odd
with his behavior

30:16.640 --> 30:18.817
since we've been here?

30:21.123 --> 30:23.734
That woman at the party.

30:23.778 --> 30:26.128
She said something weird
about Elliot.

30:26.172 --> 30:27.477
-Who?
-- The British lady.

30:27.521 --> 30:29.175
The eccentric.

30:29.218 --> 30:31.090
Helen?

30:31.133 --> 30:33.005
-She was there?
-Yeah.

30:34.397 --> 30:38.837
She's just the crackpot in town.
Don't pay any attention to her.

30:40.360 --> 30:44.930
Look, Elliot's just processing
a huge change.

30:44.973 --> 30:45.974
We all are.

30:46.975 --> 30:49.891
You and me
just need to stay calm

30:49.935 --> 30:52.198
and not get caught up
in any of his stuff.

30:55.331 --> 30:56.898
What do you mean, "his stuff"?

30:56.942 --> 31:00.119
You know, like Nathan's bed
and things.

31:00.162 --> 31:02.251
That's what makes him feel safe.

31:02.295 --> 31:05.211
Yeah. At some point,
that sort of thing has to end.

31:09.128 --> 31:12.044
Why don't you do something
with him, then?

31:12.087 --> 31:15.569
Take him out.
Do guy things.

31:15.612 --> 31:17.310
Guy things?

31:17.353 --> 31:19.660
Yeah.

31:19.703 --> 31:21.880
I don't know.

31:21.923 --> 31:24.621
He just wants you
to pay him attention.

31:26.014 --> 31:27.929
Okay.

31:27.973 --> 31:29.670
I'll talk to him.

31:32.064 --> 31:34.240
I'll do something with him.

31:37.243 --> 31:38.722
Thank you.

32:14.454 --> 32:16.064
- Stop!

32:28.729 --> 32:30.731
You're too fast!

32:30.774 --> 32:32.907
You're too fast.

32:33.516 --> 32:34.778
Oh!

32:36.693 --> 32:38.086
Mama's tired.

32:38.130 --> 32:39.870
Oh, come on, Mom.

32:39.914 --> 32:41.916
No, Mama's out.
Here.

32:41.960 --> 32:44.092
-One more time?
-Come here. Mnh-mnh.

32:44.136 --> 32:45.441
No, Mom.
Don't.

32:45.485 --> 32:47.835
I can't kiss you anymore?
Come here.

32:47.878 --> 32:49.228
Hey, come here.

32:51.665 --> 32:54.189
You're still my little guy.

33:14.862 --> 33:15.819
Hey, bud.

33:15.863 --> 33:19.388
Dinner is almost ready.

33:19.432 --> 33:21.521
Can you move that stuff?

33:27.266 --> 33:28.528
Elliot.

33:30.008 --> 33:31.879
I know you can hear me.

34:01.517 --> 34:03.432
Why would you draw this?

34:10.483 --> 34:14.095
You don't want to hurt Mommy,
do you?

34:25.411 --> 34:27.674
Don't draw this again.

34:28.631 --> 34:30.329
Okay.

37:18.671 --> 37:22.065
Elliot!
What are you doing?!

37:30.596 --> 37:33.381
Why'd you leave me there?

37:38.604 --> 37:41.128
This is just a dream.

38:17.077 --> 38:18.600
Shh, shh, shh.

38:19.297 --> 38:21.951
Mom, what are you doing?

38:21.995 --> 38:25.390
- I'm just putting you
in your own bed, sweetheart.

38:27.217 --> 38:29.002
Shh, shh, shh.

38:31.874 --> 38:33.006
Elliot.

38:34.834 --> 38:36.009
What's wrong?

38:36.052 --> 38:38.403
I'm not Elliot.

38:38.446 --> 38:40.361
I'm Nathan.

38:40.405 --> 38:42.798
Elliot's gone.

38:46.498 --> 38:49.675
- I didn't imagine it.
That is what he said.

38:49.718 --> 38:51.067
Rachel, don't.

38:51.111 --> 38:52.417
Listen to me.

38:52.460 --> 38:55.942
I know it sounds nuts.
I think so too.

38:55.985 --> 38:58.423
But Elliot's
in some kind of trouble.

38:58.466 --> 39:01.077
He wouldn't say
something like that otherwise.

39:02.688 --> 39:07.170
Ever since we moved here,
he has not been himself.

39:08.737 --> 39:11.261
And something happened to him
at that party.

39:11.305 --> 39:14.047
Look, none of us
are our normal selves.

39:14.090 --> 39:16.310
He says he's Nathan.

39:16.354 --> 39:18.573
Think about that.

39:19.966 --> 39:23.317
What kind of parents are we
if we do nothing?

39:27.060 --> 39:29.062
- Give them back.
They're mine.

39:29.105 --> 39:31.194
Give them back!

39:33.893 --> 39:35.373
No, they're mine!

39:35.416 --> 39:37.592
Elliot,
these are Nathan's toys.

39:37.636 --> 39:40.160
I'm not Elliot!

39:40.203 --> 39:42.641
Give them back!
They're mine!

39:42.684 --> 39:45.121
You're not Nathan!

39:47.733 --> 39:49.212
He's dead!

39:57.090 --> 39:58.526
Sweetie.

39:58.570 --> 40:00.572
Oh, sweetie.

40:07.056 --> 40:09.276
Hey.

40:09.319 --> 40:11.147
Mommy's sorry.

40:31.777 --> 40:33.866
-- Okay.
-What is he saying?

40:35.433 --> 40:37.130
Look, it's complicated.

40:37.173 --> 40:39.132
We need help.

40:39.175 --> 40:40.350
Do you understand me?

40:41.830 --> 40:43.789
Help.

40:47.923 --> 40:51.405
Your family has endured
a terrible tragedy,

40:51.449 --> 40:53.842
a massive change.

40:54.582 --> 40:59.544
The things you think happened,
they can sound crazy.

41:00.545 --> 41:02.460
But to me...

41:04.287 --> 41:07.508
...they are completely
understandable.

41:07.552 --> 41:12.121
They're a little boy's attempts
to understand what happened

41:12.165 --> 41:15.429
in his own limited way.

41:15.473 --> 41:17.213
No.

41:17.257 --> 41:19.781
No. I'm sorry.
There's something else to it.

41:19.825 --> 41:21.087
If you saw the way --

41:21.130 --> 41:23.959
Elliot is a mirror.

41:24.917 --> 41:28.094
He's a reflection
of your emotions and fears.

41:28.137 --> 41:31.532
Especially yours, Rachel.

41:31.576 --> 41:34.927
He's leaning on you
in this difficult time.

41:34.970 --> 41:38.713
That's why the best thing
you can do for him as a mother

41:38.757 --> 41:42.151
is to be calm.

41:44.458 --> 41:47.896
Do it for yourself,
not just for your son.

41:47.940 --> 41:49.550
No.

41:49.594 --> 41:51.900
No, no, no, no.

41:51.944 --> 41:53.815
This isn't about me.

41:55.425 --> 42:00.300
I brought Elliot to you because
he thinks he's his dead brother.

42:01.562 --> 42:06.132
And you're asking me to be calm.

42:10.484 --> 42:14.488
I can try to book you
an appointment in the city.

42:14.532 --> 42:18.231
But that can take time.

42:18.274 --> 42:19.754
We are not in New York.

42:19.798 --> 42:22.061
No shit.

42:25.020 --> 42:27.196
Come on, Elliot.

42:27.240 --> 42:28.720
We're going.

42:57.400 --> 42:59.054
What took you so long?

42:59.098 --> 43:00.490
Sorry.

43:00.534 --> 43:02.623
-I just wanted to talk to --
-Okay. Cool.

43:02.667 --> 43:04.582
Just leave.

43:57.286 --> 43:58.679
Excuse the mess.

43:58.723 --> 44:00.768
-I don't ever really get guests.
-- Oh, no.

44:00.812 --> 44:03.336
My husband was merciless
when it came to tidying,

44:03.379 --> 44:05.338
so I think this might be
my way of rebelling.

44:05.381 --> 44:08.036
Although I always thought I was
quite a neat person, really.

44:08.080 --> 44:11.257
But as my father always said,

44:11.300 --> 44:14.216
the only thing harder
than finding the truth

44:14.260 --> 44:15.914
is accepting it.

44:15.957 --> 44:18.003
Yes.

44:18.046 --> 44:19.657
Now...

44:21.093 --> 44:23.356
You came here for a reason.

44:24.400 --> 44:25.663
Um...

44:26.533 --> 44:30.972
You said something at the party
about my son.

44:31.016 --> 44:32.800
What did you mean?

44:43.289 --> 44:45.334
Are you religious, Rachel?

44:47.249 --> 44:49.730
I used to be.

44:49.774 --> 44:51.297
- Well, I don't know
if you've noticed,

44:51.340 --> 44:54.517
but there's no church here.

44:54.561 --> 44:57.738
People have lived here
since the dawn of time.

44:59.522 --> 45:03.657
That's what brought me
and my husband here too.

45:03.701 --> 45:06.529
A rich pagan culture.

45:07.443 --> 45:10.664
So rich that whenever anyone
tried to build a church here,

45:10.708 --> 45:12.622
it was burned to the ground.

45:12.666 --> 45:15.103
What does that have to do
with Elliot?

45:16.191 --> 45:19.020
It has everything
to do with Elliot.

45:22.023 --> 45:24.722
Everything here is connected.

45:26.462 --> 45:27.986
Haven't you noticed?

45:30.162 --> 45:34.427
Everything here is round,
circular.

45:34.470 --> 45:35.515
Look.

45:36.603 --> 45:38.779
It's exceptional, really.

45:38.823 --> 45:42.000
The fields, the farms,
and their yards.

45:42.043 --> 45:44.306
Even the waterways.

45:44.350 --> 45:48.789
They all have perfect
circular forms.

45:50.573 --> 45:53.794
And where do they all lead?

45:57.493 --> 45:59.931
To the sacrificial rock.

46:01.019 --> 46:03.325
You've been there, haven't you?

46:06.111 --> 46:08.504
I don't understand.

46:09.462 --> 46:11.856
Well, I thought you said
you studied architecture.

46:12.508 --> 46:14.815
Haven't you ever come across
old pagan beliefs

46:14.859 --> 46:16.338
about the meaning of circles?

46:16.382 --> 46:20.168
Human imperfection,
spiral of hate?

46:20.212 --> 46:22.170
Infinite swing of the pendulum?

46:22.823 --> 46:25.304
Sacrilege against
the Holy Trinity?

46:25.957 --> 46:27.262
No?

46:27.959 --> 46:32.615
When shapes were handed down
at the dawn of time,

46:32.659 --> 46:34.792
who got the circles?

46:39.318 --> 46:41.059
I meant what I said
at the party.

46:43.104 --> 46:48.544
Your son has made a wish,
and it's been granted.

46:48.588 --> 46:51.547
And that's why you're here.

46:53.854 --> 46:56.770
It's not his dead brother
that comes to him at night.

46:58.554 --> 47:00.513
That is something else
altogether.

47:11.524 --> 47:13.700
The eternal incubus.

47:13.743 --> 47:17.443
Destroyer of all virtues.

47:17.486 --> 47:19.706
We're on his land.

47:21.708 --> 47:24.058
This is where he dwells.

47:25.364 --> 47:27.540
And he wants your son.

47:28.976 --> 47:31.718
And he won't let go
till he's done.

47:35.765 --> 47:36.941
No.

47:36.984 --> 47:40.031
I'm sorry, Helen.

47:40.074 --> 47:42.381
Th-This is not your fault.
It's me.

47:42.424 --> 47:46.254
I sometimes imagine things,
and then they get out of hand.

47:46.298 --> 47:49.344
-I'll leave you now.
-But this is what he wants.

47:49.997 --> 47:52.478
This is what he wants --
disbelief.

47:52.521 --> 47:54.872
So he can spin
his twisted schemes.

47:54.915 --> 47:55.960
I should go now.

47:56.003 --> 47:58.788
We ignore him and he wins.

47:58.832 --> 48:00.747
Thank you, Helen.

48:02.183 --> 48:03.663
He'll come.

48:03.706 --> 48:04.925
He'll come.

48:04.969 --> 48:07.449
And they'll take
your other son too.

48:21.289 --> 48:22.682
Where have you been?

48:24.423 --> 48:26.077
I was lost.

48:26.120 --> 48:28.688
What do you mean, lost?

48:30.168 --> 48:32.910
- Do we need to talk
about this right now?

48:32.953 --> 48:34.215
- Rachel.

49:25.527 --> 49:27.442
Who's there?

51:25.691 --> 51:28.389
It wasn't just a bad dream.

51:31.740 --> 51:33.786
It was a warning.

51:41.010 --> 51:42.708
Helen.

51:43.839 --> 51:45.885
I understand that.

51:47.713 --> 51:49.715
But we're okay.

51:50.716 --> 51:52.109
Really.

52:02.075 --> 52:08.168
Has anyone ever told you
what happened to my husband?

52:10.953 --> 52:14.087
He was the first one

52:14.131 --> 52:19.223
to really understand
what was going on here.

52:20.746 --> 52:22.878
He tried to warn us.

52:24.793 --> 52:27.405
And of course
I didn't believe him.

52:30.190 --> 52:32.149
I couldn't.

52:33.498 --> 52:36.065
I just wasn't ready.

52:38.329 --> 52:40.244
And they made him pay.

52:55.563 --> 52:56.912
What happened to him?

53:24.940 --> 53:27.247
He died the following spring.

53:29.728 --> 53:31.208
What was left of him, anyway.

53:46.048 --> 53:48.834
You see strange dreams,
don't you?

53:51.750 --> 53:54.361
These dreams are trying to
tell you something.

53:54.405 --> 53:57.146
No, it's just my mind
playing tricks on me.

53:57.190 --> 53:58.235
- No.

53:59.018 --> 54:02.195
Don't let him confuse you.

54:02.239 --> 54:04.719
Trust your mother's instinct.

54:06.634 --> 54:09.855
I just don't know
what's real anymore.

54:11.160 --> 54:12.553
I know.

54:13.772 --> 54:16.122
It happened to me too.

54:19.821 --> 54:22.084
Please.

54:22.128 --> 54:23.347
I need to know.

54:25.784 --> 54:28.526
What does he want from my son?

54:31.790 --> 54:33.661
Everything.

54:33.705 --> 54:35.315
Rachel?

54:37.143 --> 54:39.232
Rachel, look at me.

54:39.276 --> 54:40.712
We'll get through this.

54:40.755 --> 54:43.105
Elliot won't end up
like my husband.

54:43.149 --> 54:44.368
We're not gonna let that happen.

54:44.411 --> 54:45.978
No.

54:46.021 --> 54:47.893
- Well, you'll just have to
trust me, all right?

54:47.936 --> 54:49.547
You do everything that I say.

54:49.590 --> 54:51.679
Rach, are you out here?

55:50.259 --> 55:52.261
- Hey.

55:52.305 --> 55:54.307
I've been looking for you.

55:55.874 --> 55:57.832
Why aren't you swinging?

55:59.573 --> 56:02.097
I need someone to push me.

56:02.141 --> 56:04.012
Okay.

56:04.056 --> 56:06.188
I'm gonna give you a push.

56:06.232 --> 56:08.452
Ready?
Hold on tight.

56:08.495 --> 56:10.758
-Thank you, Mommy.

56:11.803 --> 56:14.283
Mom, faster. Faster.

56:14.327 --> 56:15.676
- Okay.

56:18.940 --> 56:20.507
Hold on.

56:23.902 --> 56:26.774
No! Stop taking photos.

56:26.818 --> 56:29.386
Stop it.
I don't want to.

56:29.429 --> 56:30.952
Stop taking photos.

56:30.996 --> 56:32.911
-Okay!
-Stop.

56:32.954 --> 56:34.913
Okay.
Calm down.

56:34.956 --> 56:37.263
What's wrong with you?

56:37.306 --> 56:39.134
Stop it, Mommy.

56:39.178 --> 56:40.832
- Elliot.

57:01.809 --> 57:04.159
Don't say that.

57:04.203 --> 57:05.726
You're being a baby right now.

57:05.770 --> 57:07.119
Dad doesn't love me.

57:07.162 --> 57:09.469
I hate him.
He's stupid.

57:09.513 --> 57:10.818
Don't say that.

57:10.862 --> 57:13.212
Dad just has so much work to do.

57:13.255 --> 57:14.474
He doesn't mean anything by it.

57:14.518 --> 57:16.737
No.
He doesn't like me one bit.

57:16.781 --> 57:18.652
That is not true, Elliot.

57:18.696 --> 57:20.959
Dad loves you.
You know that.

57:21.002 --> 57:22.526
Come away from there.

57:22.569 --> 57:25.877
- No. He loves
Nathan more. I know it.

57:27.400 --> 57:32.057
Elliot, did Nathan say that
to you?

57:33.754 --> 57:35.277
Elliot.

57:39.064 --> 57:40.718
What is this?

57:42.415 --> 57:44.199
What's this dirt?

57:48.595 --> 57:50.858
Give it back!

57:51.990 --> 57:53.426
You dug this up?

57:53.948 --> 57:56.473
- Give me that!
It's mine!

58:24.196 --> 58:27.504
- Rach.
What's that smell?

58:33.727 --> 58:37.426
I was burning the milk cartons.
Sorry.

58:40.647 --> 58:42.257
Can we talk?

58:45.304 --> 58:47.349
Nathan would have liked it here.

58:53.225 --> 58:55.009
Sometimes...

58:56.010 --> 59:01.668
...I find myself thinking
maybe we were punished.

59:02.495 --> 59:04.236
What do you mean?

59:06.804 --> 59:08.283
Well...

59:09.807 --> 59:15.813
We were given such an --
such an easy,

59:15.856 --> 59:20.426
wonderful kid like Elliot

59:20.469 --> 59:23.472
that we had to have Nathan too.

59:27.955 --> 59:30.610
I know it's a terrible thought.

59:34.309 --> 59:36.181
But his issues.

59:36.224 --> 59:40.577
Rach, you were the best mother
a kid like him could have.

59:43.144 --> 59:45.538
There were times when I...

59:50.891 --> 59:56.462
...I wished
that he would be gone.

1:00:00.901 --> 1:00:03.164
That it'd all end.

1:00:10.345 --> 1:00:12.565
And then when it happened...

1:00:15.786 --> 1:00:18.179
...there was a part of me...

1:00:20.529 --> 1:00:23.576
There was a part of me
that felt relieved.

1:00:23.620 --> 1:00:24.621
Rachel, don't.

1:00:29.147 --> 1:00:31.715
I was just so exhausted.

1:00:36.502 --> 1:00:37.938
Maybe it was my fault.

1:00:37.982 --> 1:00:39.070
Hey.

1:00:39.113 --> 1:00:40.593
Hey.

1:00:45.685 --> 1:00:47.208
It's okay.

1:00:47.992 --> 1:00:49.515
Shh.

1:02:33.358 --> 1:02:35.403
- Mom.

1:02:37.623 --> 1:02:39.451
Sweetie.

1:03:03.431 --> 1:03:04.650
- Mom.

1:03:06.565 --> 1:03:08.045
- Elliot.

1:03:11.222 --> 1:03:13.050
Come over here.

1:03:20.361 --> 1:03:21.667
Elliot.

1:03:22.973 --> 1:03:24.191
What's wrong?

1:03:24.235 --> 1:03:26.280
Nathan wants to see you.

1:03:29.370 --> 1:03:31.459
He won't wake up.

1:03:33.113 --> 1:03:34.680
Come with me.

1:03:47.388 --> 1:03:51.044
- Don't go. No.
No, don't go.

1:03:52.524 --> 1:03:54.091
Don't go.

1:04:04.014 --> 1:04:05.493
- Don't.

1:04:06.886 --> 1:04:09.758
Elliot.

1:04:09.802 --> 1:04:11.151
What's going on?

1:04:11.195 --> 1:04:12.849
Nate's waiting.

1:04:29.474 --> 1:04:31.780
Just look into the flame.

1:04:31.824 --> 1:04:34.000
I'll help you.

1:04:34.827 --> 1:04:35.959
Elliot, what is this?

1:04:36.002 --> 1:04:37.177
Shh!

1:04:37.221 --> 1:04:40.398
Mom, concentrate.

1:04:46.273 --> 1:04:47.884
Nate?

1:04:49.189 --> 1:04:50.887
Nathan?

1:04:51.844 --> 1:04:53.585
Mom's here.

1:05:02.376 --> 1:05:04.291
He sees you.

1:05:07.164 --> 1:05:10.036
And says you're beautiful.

1:05:15.999 --> 1:05:17.522
Nathan.

1:05:19.872 --> 1:05:21.830
He sees me?

1:05:24.921 --> 1:05:27.053
Can I see him?

1:05:27.097 --> 1:05:29.012
Take the mirror.

1:05:30.491 --> 1:05:32.015
Take it.

1:05:45.854 --> 1:05:48.509
- No!

1:05:50.468 --> 1:05:55.908
Now look at me in the mirror.

1:05:59.259 --> 1:06:00.652
- Elliot.

1:06:02.175 --> 1:06:03.350
Shh.

1:06:04.221 --> 1:06:05.962
Look.

1:06:27.940 --> 1:06:31.030
Mom.

1:07:07.936 --> 1:07:09.764
They only want Elliot.

1:07:10.722 --> 1:07:14.726
We give him,
and we get Nathan back.

1:07:22.386 --> 1:07:24.866
An exchange.

1:07:26.738 --> 1:07:27.782
Look.

1:07:29.306 --> 1:07:31.351
It's already happened.

1:07:36.313 --> 1:07:38.097
He's gone.

1:07:38.141 --> 1:07:39.403
Where did he go?

1:07:39.446 --> 1:07:40.621
Elliot's gone.

1:07:41.405 --> 1:07:43.276
- Elliot.

1:07:43.320 --> 1:07:44.756
Elliot!

1:09:03.487 --> 1:09:05.141
-- Good morning.
-Mommy!

1:09:05.184 --> 1:09:07.143
- Hi.

1:09:07.708 --> 1:09:09.275
I made you some breakfast.

1:09:09.319 --> 1:09:11.712
You did, did you?

1:09:12.800 --> 1:09:14.585
Thank you.

1:09:14.628 --> 1:09:16.413
I'm sorry I slept so late.

1:09:16.456 --> 1:09:18.284
It's good.
You've earned it.

1:09:18.328 --> 1:09:20.068
I'm gonna help Dad
with the well.

1:09:20.112 --> 1:09:24.029
You are, are you?

1:09:24.072 --> 1:09:26.466
- What have I gone
and promised this time?

1:09:27.946 --> 1:09:29.295
Oh, yeah.

1:09:29.339 --> 1:09:31.515
I managed to break the vacuum.

1:09:31.558 --> 1:09:33.430
How about we all go into town
and get a new one?

1:09:33.473 --> 1:09:34.344
Yeah!

1:09:39.653 --> 1:09:42.134
Rach, are you coming?

1:09:43.918 --> 1:09:45.224
Yeah.

1:09:45.268 --> 1:09:46.834
Sounds good.

1:09:58.498 --> 1:10:01.240
I'll be right back.
I've just got to get something.

1:10:01.284 --> 1:10:03.503
Uh, okay.

1:10:23.131 --> 1:10:25.569
So, did you find anything?

1:10:27.223 --> 1:10:28.833
No.

1:10:30.791 --> 1:10:32.445
Everything okay?

1:10:35.448 --> 1:10:36.623
Yeah.

1:11:30.373 --> 1:11:32.288
- Mom?

1:11:34.246 --> 1:11:36.074
Are you there?

1:11:43.777 --> 1:11:45.475
Mom?

1:11:50.088 --> 1:11:52.482
Can I see the photos too?

1:12:14.808 --> 1:12:16.332
Mom?

1:12:17.202 --> 1:12:19.900
Can I see the photos too?

1:12:19.944 --> 1:12:21.206
No.

1:12:22.468 --> 1:12:26.037
No.
There was something wrong.

1:12:26.080 --> 1:12:29.388
With the processing.

1:12:34.350 --> 1:12:36.613
-I did it.

1:12:36.656 --> 1:12:39.398
I took pictures of Elliot to see
if he had the same shadow.

1:12:39.442 --> 1:12:41.487
-Look.
-What?

1:12:41.531 --> 1:12:43.402
- Here.
Nothing.

1:12:43.446 --> 1:12:45.404
Here and here and here.

1:12:45.448 --> 1:12:47.275
All of it.
Empty.

1:12:47.319 --> 1:12:49.495
-Rachel, there's nobody there.
-Exactly.

1:12:49.539 --> 1:12:51.932
That's what I'm trying to say.
You see it too, right?

1:12:52.498 --> 1:12:55.066
But you're sure that you --

1:12:55.109 --> 1:12:56.459
Yes!
Yes.

1:12:56.502 --> 1:12:59.070
He was right there.
I photographed him.

1:12:59.113 --> 1:13:01.246
He was right there,
and now he's gone.

1:13:01.289 --> 1:13:03.814
And this is how they came out.
See?

1:13:06.860 --> 1:13:09.428
And you know they're not fake.

1:13:09.472 --> 1:13:11.343
'Cause I thought about that,
too.

1:13:11.387 --> 1:13:12.953
Look at this.

1:13:13.824 --> 1:13:17.741
You can forge one, maybe,
in that time frame.

1:13:17.784 --> 1:13:19.525
But not all of them.

1:13:19.569 --> 1:13:20.831
Look.

1:13:20.874 --> 1:13:23.137
They're all the same.

1:13:28.012 --> 1:13:30.493
Helen, I'm not crazy.

1:13:31.624 --> 1:13:33.539
He was there.

1:13:35.802 --> 1:13:37.674
It's him.

1:13:38.414 --> 1:13:39.850
Isn't it?

1:13:40.807 --> 1:13:43.114
You believe me now, don't you?

1:13:45.986 --> 1:13:47.771
Yes.

1:13:47.814 --> 1:13:49.903
It's mockery.

1:13:50.469 --> 1:13:52.123
Nothing more.

1:13:53.733 --> 1:13:59.478
With these photos, he's saying,
"I already have your son.

1:13:59.522 --> 1:14:02.176
There's nothing you can do
about it."

1:14:02.916 --> 1:14:08.269
He wants you to give in
in the face of his power.

1:14:10.446 --> 1:14:12.273
But what do we do?

1:14:21.282 --> 1:14:23.676
Take me to your son.

1:14:41.346 --> 1:14:44.871
If we hurry, we can make it to
Father Vasily before dawn.

1:14:44.915 --> 1:14:47.526
He, if anyone,
will be able to help us

1:14:47.570 --> 1:14:51.399
so we can still stop him from
attaching himself to your son.

1:14:52.444 --> 1:14:55.969
Anthony said it
had already happened.

1:14:56.622 --> 1:14:58.058
In my dream.

1:14:58.102 --> 1:14:59.625
No.

1:14:59.669 --> 1:15:00.844
No.

1:15:00.887 --> 1:15:02.541
No.
That's impossible.

1:15:02.585 --> 1:15:03.977
Not this fast.

1:15:05.631 --> 1:15:08.808
With my husband, it took years
while the devil worked on him.

1:15:09.722 --> 1:15:12.551
Attachment is the very last
stage of possession.

1:15:12.595 --> 1:15:18.818
They said something else --
about an exchange.

1:15:18.862 --> 1:15:20.733
What could that mean?

1:15:24.476 --> 1:15:25.956
What?

1:15:26.957 --> 1:15:28.306
What?

1:15:29.699 --> 1:15:31.527
Oh, God.

1:15:36.532 --> 1:15:40.927
Oh, I have been
so fucking blind.

1:15:44.104 --> 1:15:46.106
The twins.

1:15:46.150 --> 1:15:47.499
The accident.

1:15:48.369 --> 1:15:50.546
Anthony's success.

1:15:51.982 --> 1:15:54.114
And the reason why
I haven't been able to feel

1:15:54.158 --> 1:15:55.551
your son's presence.

1:15:55.594 --> 1:15:58.118
What are you talking about?

1:15:59.555 --> 1:16:02.340
It's the resurrection
of the devil.

1:16:04.342 --> 1:16:06.953
That's why Nathan had to die.

1:16:07.432 --> 1:16:09.565
To become his flesh.

1:16:10.740 --> 1:16:15.309
But in order to bring him back,
they need the other twin too.

1:16:19.270 --> 1:16:23.056
He'll tempt you
to become his new mother.

1:16:25.972 --> 1:16:29.280
How do I know you haven't agreed
to that already?

1:16:31.543 --> 1:16:34.546
I would never hurt my children.

1:16:55.523 --> 1:16:57.090
Anthony?

1:17:21.201 --> 1:17:25.379
Elliot, I want you
to meet someone.

1:17:25.423 --> 1:17:27.381
Helen, come on in.

1:17:27.425 --> 1:17:31.037
Helen, this is Elliot.
Elliot, this is Helen.

1:17:37.478 --> 1:17:39.263
- No.

1:17:40.394 --> 1:17:41.874
What's the matter?

1:17:43.876 --> 1:17:45.748
You're sick.

1:17:48.315 --> 1:17:49.969
You're sick.

1:17:55.279 --> 1:17:56.715
Helen.

1:18:14.907 --> 1:18:16.648
What is this?

1:18:18.084 --> 1:18:19.738
It's okay.

1:18:19.782 --> 1:18:22.132
These people are here
to help you.

1:18:22.175 --> 1:18:24.003
What do you mean?

1:18:43.109 --> 1:18:44.458
Don't hurt her!

1:18:44.502 --> 1:18:46.199
Anthony!

1:18:46.243 --> 1:18:47.940
Anthony!

1:18:50.247 --> 1:18:53.032
Anthony!

1:19:00.387 --> 1:19:03.651
Anthony!

1:19:48.435 --> 1:19:50.524
Shh.

1:19:53.614 --> 1:19:56.400
Shh.

1:23:06.459 --> 1:23:08.070
Yes.

1:25:00.921 --> 1:25:02.749
- Mom.

1:25:04.055 --> 1:25:07.319
You have to wake up.

1:25:14.370 --> 1:25:16.415
Mom.

1:25:26.599 --> 1:25:28.123
Elliot?

1:25:32.562 --> 1:25:34.477
Where are you?

1:25:38.394 --> 1:25:40.657
- I don't know.
It's hot.

1:25:44.530 --> 1:25:46.315
-Elliot.
-- Help me.

1:25:47.925 --> 1:25:49.535
Where are you?

1:25:49.579 --> 1:25:51.363
Help me.

1:26:12.167 --> 1:26:13.907
- No.
Please.

1:26:13.951 --> 1:26:15.822
I can't do this.

1:26:16.606 --> 1:26:19.522
Anthony, listen to me.

1:26:20.262 --> 1:26:22.786
It's too late.

1:26:22.829 --> 1:26:25.267
It's been decided.

1:26:25.310 --> 1:26:26.398
Okay.

1:26:26.442 --> 1:26:28.879
She will be fine.

1:26:30.489 --> 1:26:32.187
- Elliot.

1:26:33.405 --> 1:26:35.059
Elliot.

1:26:41.108 --> 1:26:42.632
Elliot.

1:26:43.633 --> 1:26:44.851
Oh!

1:26:55.340 --> 1:26:57.473
-Elliot.
-Mommy!

1:26:57.516 --> 1:26:59.388
They hurt you.

1:27:00.693 --> 1:27:02.565
Here. No.
Wait.

1:27:05.524 --> 1:27:06.656
Oh, God.

1:27:06.699 --> 1:27:08.048
Are you okay?

1:27:08.092 --> 1:27:10.181
Okay.
So we have to go now.

1:27:10.225 --> 1:27:12.836
But we got to be really,
really quiet.

1:27:12.879 --> 1:27:15.360
Like a game of hide-and-seek.

1:27:15.404 --> 1:27:18.145
Nathan can help us.

1:27:18.189 --> 1:27:19.321
No.

1:27:19.364 --> 1:27:22.454
You don't listen to him.
Okay?

1:27:22.498 --> 1:27:24.456
Look at me.

1:27:24.500 --> 1:27:26.241
That is not Nathan.

1:27:45.912 --> 1:27:47.740
Okay. Okay.
Let's go.

1:27:47.784 --> 1:27:50.003
Let's go.
Go!

1:27:57.402 --> 1:27:58.360
Shit.

1:28:20.773 --> 1:28:22.775
Rachel!

1:28:24.777 --> 1:28:27.389
Rachel!

1:28:29.739 --> 1:28:32.307
Rachel!

1:28:34.265 --> 1:28:35.745
Elliot!

1:28:37.137 --> 1:28:38.835
Elliot!

1:28:39.401 --> 1:28:41.098
Where'd you go?

1:28:44.493 --> 1:28:45.972
Elliot!

1:28:48.671 --> 1:28:50.325
Rachel!

1:29:09.082 --> 1:29:10.170
Rachel!

1:29:10.214 --> 1:29:12.085
Dad!
Stop!

1:29:12.129 --> 1:29:14.044
-Rachel!
-Get off me!

1:29:14.087 --> 1:29:16.481
-Dad! Don't hurt her!
-Rachel, calm down!

1:29:17.221 --> 1:29:19.310
Rachel!

1:29:22.313 --> 1:29:23.532
- No!
Don't hurt her!

1:29:23.575 --> 1:29:26.361
Rachel, I don't want to do this!

1:29:26.404 --> 1:29:27.971
Do you hear me?

1:29:28.014 --> 1:29:30.277
Rachel, I don't want to do this!

1:29:49.340 --> 1:29:50.689
Just do it.

1:29:52.474 --> 1:29:54.780
I'm too tired
to go on with this.

1:29:55.520 --> 1:29:58.088
Just do it!

1:30:10.840 --> 1:30:11.971
Elliot.

1:30:17.760 --> 1:30:19.370
- Rachel.

1:30:24.723 --> 1:30:26.986
You just don't get it.

1:30:29.772 --> 1:30:31.774
You really don't.

1:30:38.694 --> 1:30:40.957
There is no twin.

1:30:43.960 --> 1:30:45.657
There's no Elliot!

1:30:46.484 --> 1:30:48.573
He's not real.

1:30:52.011 --> 1:30:54.579
We lost our only son that day.

1:30:58.975 --> 1:31:00.846
And you were right.

1:31:02.152 --> 1:31:04.197
I was drinking that night.

1:31:05.111 --> 1:31:08.114
Even though I said I wouldn't,
I did.

1:31:10.943 --> 1:31:13.032
But I didn't drive.

1:31:15.644 --> 1:31:17.254
You did.

1:31:21.824 --> 1:31:25.262
You got angry
and said you'd leave me.

1:31:25.305 --> 1:31:27.003
You'd had enough.

1:31:27.656 --> 1:31:30.876
But I didn't realize
that you took Nathan with you.

1:31:40.625 --> 1:31:43.062
You had the accident, Rach.

1:31:44.716 --> 1:31:47.632
Don't listen to him!
Let's go!

1:31:48.851 --> 1:31:51.244
We lost our only son that day.

1:31:53.116 --> 1:31:55.161
-Nathan.
-Shut up!

1:32:02.734 --> 1:32:06.738
- You closed yourself
off, denied it, blamed me.

1:32:07.565 --> 1:32:09.524
I lost you both.

1:32:10.916 --> 1:32:12.962
Don't listen to him!

1:32:13.005 --> 1:32:15.051
He's lying!

1:32:15.530 --> 1:32:17.270
And then, suddenly...

1:32:19.795 --> 1:32:21.884
...a miracle.

1:32:24.277 --> 1:32:25.452
Elliot.

1:32:36.507 --> 1:32:38.596
He just went down.

1:32:40.380 --> 1:32:42.600
You invented him, Rachel.

1:32:42.644 --> 1:32:46.212
And my only mistake
was to let you imagine him.

1:32:46.256 --> 1:32:50.565
But for the first time
in a long while, you were happy.

1:32:57.093 --> 1:32:58.485
- In the name
of the Father and the Son

1:32:58.529 --> 1:32:59.791
and the Holy Spirit.

1:33:00.879 --> 1:33:04.317
Dear Heavenly Father, thank you.

1:33:05.884 --> 1:33:08.844
- Elliot became
our reason to live.

1:33:08.887 --> 1:33:10.541
He made us a family again.

1:33:14.153 --> 1:33:16.329
But we couldn't live like that.

1:33:16.895 --> 1:33:20.986
It became harder and harder
to keep our secret.

1:33:34.130 --> 1:33:37.089
Everyone said it has to stop,

1:33:37.133 --> 1:33:40.092
but they hadn't seen
what I had seen.

1:33:40.876 --> 1:33:44.488
Without Elliot, you could have
just as well been dead.

1:33:46.229 --> 1:33:47.883
That's why I did it.

1:33:49.188 --> 1:33:51.190
You miss him, don't you?

1:33:58.067 --> 1:33:59.459
Elliot.

1:34:04.551 --> 1:34:06.728
They would've taken Elliot
from you.

1:34:06.771 --> 1:34:08.643
That's why we had
no other choice.

1:34:10.296 --> 1:34:14.910
Elliot, you can't just run off
like that.

1:34:14.953 --> 1:34:16.128
Do you hear me?!

1:34:16.781 --> 1:34:18.783
Do you see all the dangers
around here?

1:34:18.827 --> 1:34:22.918
What saved you would destroy us.

1:34:24.136 --> 1:34:26.617
I'm gonna get you!

1:34:26.661 --> 1:34:29.402
Day after day, you sank deeper.

1:34:29.446 --> 1:34:30.665
-Fuck!

1:34:37.149 --> 1:34:38.934
Rachel!

1:34:39.935 --> 1:34:42.067
I didn't know what to do
at that point.

1:34:42.111 --> 1:34:43.329
You're sick.

1:34:43.373 --> 1:34:44.853
I was losing you, Rachel.

1:34:45.941 --> 1:34:47.420
- Anthony!

1:34:47.943 --> 1:34:49.031
Anthony!

1:35:08.267 --> 1:35:11.140
I did it all out of love,
Rachel.

1:35:14.012 --> 1:35:17.755
Look. All of this will become
clear if you just accept it.

1:35:17.799 --> 1:35:20.279
-Don't listen to him!
-It's the only sensible answer.

1:35:20.323 --> 1:35:21.541
He's lying!

1:35:21.585 --> 1:35:23.108
You know the truth.

1:35:23.152 --> 1:35:24.849
I'm right here!

1:35:24.893 --> 1:35:27.417
No devil, no possession.

1:35:27.460 --> 1:35:29.375
Just clarity.

1:35:29.419 --> 1:35:30.855
Shut up!

1:35:35.555 --> 1:35:36.774
Mom!

1:35:42.780 --> 1:35:44.521
It's okay, honey.

1:35:46.697 --> 1:35:48.177
It's okay.
Let it come.

1:35:48.220 --> 1:35:49.700
Let it come.

1:35:50.745 --> 1:35:53.878
You can see it now.
I know you can see it.

1:35:54.618 --> 1:35:55.750
The truth.

1:36:28.826 --> 1:36:31.394
Mom, they're gonna kill me!

1:37:07.473 --> 1:37:09.127
Elliot!

1:37:48.514 --> 1:37:50.212
Elliot!

1:37:53.998 --> 1:37:56.522
Hey.
Sweetheart.

1:37:56.958 --> 1:37:59.438
You don't believe me anymore.

1:38:00.091 --> 1:38:01.919
Oh, darling.

1:38:01.963 --> 1:38:04.791
Come here.
Hey.

1:38:08.099 --> 1:38:10.362
Of course I believe you.

1:38:12.451 --> 1:38:14.105
Hey.
Look at me.

1:38:15.454 --> 1:38:17.500
You're my son.

1:38:18.370 --> 1:38:20.372
And I love you.

1:38:21.504 --> 1:38:23.898
I love you so much.

1:38:27.553 --> 1:38:28.815
Okay.

1:38:28.859 --> 1:38:30.295
Okay.
Go this way.

1:38:32.036 --> 1:38:33.342
No.

1:38:37.781 --> 1:38:39.087
- Rachel.

1:38:40.262 --> 1:38:42.177
Rachel, listen to me.

1:38:42.220 --> 1:38:45.006
Now, you're not well.

1:38:45.049 --> 1:38:47.486
Okay?
No one wants to hurt you.

1:38:47.530 --> 1:38:49.227
We want to help.

1:38:49.271 --> 1:38:50.663
I thought we could fix it all,

1:38:50.707 --> 1:38:52.535
that we could finally
be free of Elliot.

1:38:52.578 --> 1:38:54.232
-Shut up!
-- Rachel!

1:38:54.276 --> 1:38:56.321
He's not real.

1:38:56.365 --> 1:38:59.759
He's not fucking real!

1:38:59.803 --> 1:39:01.370
No!

1:39:03.415 --> 1:39:04.764
Elliot.

1:39:07.202 --> 1:39:08.159
Rachel.

1:39:08.203 --> 1:39:10.988
Elliot, I'm coming.

1:39:11.032 --> 1:39:12.207
Mama's coming.

1:39:16.254 --> 1:39:17.995
- No!
This ends now!

1:39:22.913 --> 1:39:25.394
He's not real.

1:39:25.437 --> 1:39:29.746
He's not fucking real!

1:39:33.054 --> 1:39:34.794
No!

1:40:04.389 --> 1:40:05.869
Elliot!

1:41:20.378 --> 1:41:21.771
Ah.

1:43:02.959 --> 1:43:04.526
You all right?

1:43:13.012 --> 1:43:14.492
Yeah.

1:43:16.015 --> 1:43:18.148
I'm just a little bit tired.

1:43:20.324 --> 1:43:22.196
It's done.

1:43:23.197 --> 1:43:24.763
I'm free.

1:43:29.028 --> 1:43:31.292
What about you guys?

1:43:50.311 --> 1:43:54.358
Rach, we good to go?

1:43:57.405 --> 1:44:00.799
Well, are we ready?

1:44:02.627 --> 1:44:04.107
- Yeah!

1:44:05.151 --> 1:44:06.762
Let's do this.

1:44:06.805 --> 1:44:08.198
- Let's do this.
