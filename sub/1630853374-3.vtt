[josh]
<i> barry is not happy at all.</i>

00:08.009 --> 00:09.641
I'm not going to let
the old man sweep that.

00:11.112 --> 00:13.712
I'm trying to fix this.

00:13.714 --> 00:17.950
If we can't get fish faster,
it's over.

00:18.019 --> 00:21.053
We're on the hook
for 3,000 pounds of fish
every week

00:21.122 --> 00:23.155
<i> For our clients</i>
<i> on the mainland.</i>

00:23.224 --> 00:25.524
So far, we've come up
like twice.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.526
<i> And last week,</i>
<i> we delivered late.</i>

00:28.496 --> 00:30.629
<i> Now barry wants a meeting.</i>

00:30.631 --> 00:31.964
Probably not good news.

00:33.634 --> 00:35.934
[barry] josh, I really
can't do this anymore.

00:36.036 --> 00:39.738
I'm running
this whole place over here,
and I'm depending on you guys

00:39.807 --> 00:43.008
And now you can't deliver
on time, man, that's...
That's important to me.

00:44.412 --> 00:46.211
[josh] all right.
Hey, barry, stop.

00:47.515 --> 00:49.748
I depended on you guys
for something.

00:49.817 --> 00:52.851
Restaurants are opening,
we're open.

00:52.920 --> 00:55.320
I'm doing 600 covers a night
and it's a [bleep] depending
on your quality

00:55.322 --> 00:57.523
And product coming
into my restaurant,
especially the time.

00:57.525 --> 00:59.124
If they're telling me
it's coming in on Friday,

00:59.126 --> 01:01.160
"oh, the plane didn't arrive."

01:01.228 --> 01:02.461
We [stammers] we're gonna do?

01:03.764 --> 01:04.963
I can't rely on you guys.

01:06.133 --> 01:07.533
Trying to get this
order completed.

01:07.634 --> 01:09.601
You know, we pushed
you guys over the top
to cover

01:09.603 --> 01:11.603
When nobody
else could deliver.

01:11.605 --> 01:12.805
We got this.

01:12.807 --> 01:14.406
We just need
a couple more days.

01:15.943 --> 01:17.309
Look, here's what's going
to happen.

01:17.311 --> 01:19.711
I'm going to let you finish
the current order,

01:19.713 --> 01:22.147
But I'm going to put
everything else on pause.

01:22.216 --> 01:24.349
Until you guys get
your [bleep] together.

01:24.451 --> 01:25.918
I just got to look elsewhere.

01:26.020 --> 01:28.420
-All right, man.
-All right, brother.

01:28.422 --> 01:29.521
Listen, I'm sorry, man.

01:29.523 --> 01:31.223
It's all good.
Sorry. I got you.

01:34.228 --> 01:36.028
Yeah!
Boom!

01:36.030 --> 01:37.996
I am captain, josh harris.

01:37.998 --> 01:39.398
I keep looking
at that picture

01:39.400 --> 01:40.999
<i> And he keeps looking back</i>
<i> at me.</i>

01:41.001 --> 01:45.604
<i> Phil harris was my father</i>
<i> and a legend</i>
<i> on the bering sea.</i>

01:45.606 --> 01:47.639
[phil] you can't get
any better than me.

01:47.708 --> 01:49.608
I'm just a smiling
[bleep] jack.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.810
[josh] <i> after a decade apart</i>

01:51.812 --> 01:54.813
<i> My older brother shane</i>
<i> is back by my side.</i>

01:54.815 --> 01:56.348
[shane] ...Fighting 'em still.

01:57.618 --> 02:00.052
[josh] <i> together, we're</i>
<i> fulfilling my dad's dream</i>

02:00.054 --> 02:01.920
<i> For an off-season</i>
<i> fishing business.</i>

02:01.922 --> 02:03.055
[shane grunts]

02:03.057 --> 02:04.756
[shane] that's for you phil.

02:04.758 --> 02:07.726
[josh] <i> but if we can't catc</i>
<i> what we need</i>
<i> in hawaiian waters...</i>

02:07.728 --> 02:10.896
If you're not gonna respect
our home then
don't come here.

02:10.898 --> 02:13.031
[josh] <i> we'll follow</i>
<i> the old man's footsteps.</i>

02:13.033 --> 02:14.433
[casey] we got tuna!

02:14.501 --> 02:16.902
Good. Client's alive.

02:16.904 --> 02:18.437
Wherever the trail leads...

02:19.807 --> 02:22.541
You put so much
into this here,

02:22.643 --> 02:24.109
And now you want to leave?

02:30.618 --> 02:32.351
[distant seagulls cawing]

02:38.425 --> 02:40.959
[josh] so what's this big plan
you got?

02:41.061 --> 02:43.395
[jeff] well, I want to show
you guys something.

02:43.397 --> 02:44.563
[josh] all right.

02:46.901 --> 02:48.500
All right, so check this out.

02:49.937 --> 02:54.606
So, we just came from kauai

02:54.608 --> 02:56.041
And we did that
because we know

02:56.043 --> 02:57.309
That the bite starts
usually in kauai,

02:57.311 --> 02:58.810
Because the fish arrive
here first.

02:58.812 --> 03:00.012
Oh, you know what,

03:00.014 --> 03:01.613
That didn't work out
very great.

03:01.615 --> 03:05.951
[jeff] yeah, but from here
they migrate south.

03:06.053 --> 03:08.253
They've migrated down to oahu,

03:08.322 --> 03:11.223
And the next stop
that they're going to hit
is this channel,

03:11.225 --> 03:12.524
Which is
the alenuihaha channel,

03:12.526 --> 03:14.426
-Above the kona coast.
-Okay.

03:14.428 --> 03:15.994
There's a big pinnacle
out here.

03:15.996 --> 03:17.629
They call it indianapolis.

03:17.631 --> 03:19.198
There's a really good chance
that the birds

03:19.200 --> 03:22.201
And the current
and everything are gonna
hold these fish here.

03:22.203 --> 03:26.104
A pinnacle or a seamount
is basically just
an underwater mountain,

03:26.106 --> 03:29.508
Which creates a perfect
ecosystem for hungry fish.

03:29.510 --> 03:31.710
<i> And the good thing</i>
<i> about indianapolis</i>

03:31.712 --> 03:33.645
<i> That it's just far enough</i>
<i> off the coast</i>

03:33.714 --> 03:36.048
To where we can avoid
the crowds of kona.

03:36.050 --> 03:38.617
If we can intercept this bite,

03:38.619 --> 03:41.820
There's a really good chance
that we can nail 'em
before they actually

03:41.822 --> 03:43.722
Move into the grounds
where it's crowded.

03:46.427 --> 03:48.594
I mean, the currents
and the winds are
all agreeing with it?

03:48.596 --> 03:50.262
[jeff] what do you think,
shane?

03:50.364 --> 03:52.064
I mean, we're putting
all the chips in one basket,

03:52.132 --> 03:53.465
So that's the only
concern I have.

03:54.602 --> 03:57.836
[jeff] yeah, well...
I think it's a gamble. But...

03:57.938 --> 03:59.705
-[shane speaking]
-your brother here
is a gambling man.

03:59.707 --> 04:01.239
That's how fishing is.

04:01.241 --> 04:04.543
-[shane speaking]
-[jeff] every day you go
out fishing, it's a gamble.

04:04.645 --> 04:07.212
[josh] right now,
we need a hail mary like
you wouldn't believe.

04:07.214 --> 04:08.847
Time is ticking.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.515
This hopefully this works out.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.219
All right, sounds good.

04:14.221 --> 04:15.420
[josh] what do you say? Cool.

04:15.422 --> 04:16.822
-[casey] is it a plan?
-It's a plan. Okay.

04:16.824 --> 04:18.056
Sounds good.

04:30.504 --> 04:31.937
[josh] <i> it's a big order, man</i>

04:32.006 --> 04:33.705
<i> Barry put everything on paus</i>

04:33.707 --> 04:39.011
Basically, what that means
is one more missed deadline
and we're fired.

04:39.013 --> 04:40.912
<i> Times like</i>
<i> this when I have no idea</i>

04:40.914 --> 04:43.115
<i> If my business</i>
<i> is going to survive,</i>

04:43.117 --> 04:47.119
That's when I realize
what the old man went
through day-in and day-out.

04:48.555 --> 04:50.255
Geez, you go through
a couple of marriages,

04:50.291 --> 04:53.158
You smoke cigarettes like
it's going out of style

04:53.227 --> 04:58.764
And now you wake up
in the middle of the night,

04:58.832 --> 05:01.033
Thinking about where you're
going to put the next pot,
yeah.

05:01.101 --> 05:03.135
It's a...
It's a great lifestyle.

05:08.042 --> 05:09.508
Come on, fish-fishy.

05:11.612 --> 05:14.413
[seagulls cawing]

05:14.415 --> 05:15.747
<i> You can see</i>
<i> how many boats are already</i>

05:15.816 --> 05:17.115
Kind of showing up
in the area.

05:17.117 --> 05:18.317
It's going to be really
crowded,

05:18.319 --> 05:19.618
So we're going to go
a little further,

05:19.620 --> 05:21.119
And a little bit farther out.

05:21.121 --> 05:22.321
If we can get out there,

05:22.323 --> 05:23.655
Intercept this pile
that's coming in,

05:23.757 --> 05:25.424
There's a really good chance
that we can get to 'em

05:25.426 --> 05:27.859
Before the rest
of the fleet does.

05:27.928 --> 05:29.928
I'm excited to fish with jeff,

05:29.930 --> 05:32.164
Because I want to see
how the real pros do it.
[chuckles]

05:32.232 --> 05:34.399
So, no offense
to my brother and casey,

05:34.401 --> 05:36.501
But I know they don't have
as much experience as jeff,

05:36.503 --> 05:39.404
So, I'm looking
forward to learning
from one of the best.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.842
[jeff] I got to say
that shirt looks really
good on you,

05:43.944 --> 05:45.744
Better than... A lot better
than the other one does.

05:45.813 --> 05:47.346
[both laugh]

05:47.414 --> 05:48.613
We got to make it a tie-dye.

05:48.615 --> 05:50.148
We got to get
some blood on it, all right?

05:50.150 --> 05:52.551
-Yeah, let's get
some blood on this thing.
-[jeff] all right, man.

05:56.724 --> 05:58.957
Yeah, we got some marks
coming through right now,
actually.

06:00.327 --> 06:01.960
There we have three.

06:02.062 --> 06:07.132
Our goal right now
is to try to intercept
the migratory fish.

06:08.702 --> 06:11.870
<i> They stopped in kauai,</i>
<i> then stopped in oahu.</i>

06:11.872 --> 06:13.171
They're touring
all the islands.

06:13.207 --> 06:16.041
Well, we want them to see
their last tour in kona here?

06:16.043 --> 06:17.342
[monitor beeping]

06:17.444 --> 06:20.612
[josh] there's a big one...
Right here.

06:20.614 --> 06:23.115
[casey] oh, look below that,
big fish below it.

06:23.117 --> 06:25.150
[laughs]

06:25.219 --> 06:26.718
It might be onto
something here.

06:31.325 --> 06:32.524
[casey] might be on.

06:33.927 --> 06:35.127
[josh] got one?

06:37.431 --> 06:38.663
[casey] we're on.

06:38.765 --> 06:41.299
[fishing rod reeling]

06:41.301 --> 06:42.601
[casey]
take the spool there.

06:42.603 --> 06:43.835
Try and pull it down a little.

06:43.904 --> 06:46.405
Keep one engine
in gear for me.

06:46.407 --> 06:47.639
Whoa!

06:47.741 --> 06:48.740
[josh] all right.

06:50.043 --> 06:51.843
Get him, buddy.

06:51.912 --> 06:53.145
[casey] hey put it on neutral?

06:53.213 --> 06:54.513
[josh] done.

06:54.515 --> 06:57.048
All right, we're on neutral.

06:57.050 --> 06:58.417
[casey] come on, baby.

07:00.154 --> 07:01.453
[josh] what is it?

07:01.522 --> 07:03.221
I don't know,
it took line pretty good.

07:03.223 --> 07:04.523
Very good.

07:04.525 --> 07:06.158
[fishing rod reeling]

07:06.259 --> 07:07.426
[josh] oh.

07:07.428 --> 07:09.161
A little bend in rod action.

07:11.331 --> 07:14.399
[casey] oh, well,
that's a tuna.

07:14.401 --> 07:16.401
-[josh] is it?
-[casey] oh, yeah.

07:16.403 --> 07:17.602
We got tuna!

07:21.775 --> 07:23.308
[fishing rod reeling back]

07:23.310 --> 07:24.810
[casey grunts]
[casey] it's a big fish.

07:24.812 --> 07:26.311
[josh] yeah.

07:26.313 --> 07:28.146
[casey] I got color.

07:28.215 --> 07:29.347
I might want a gaff
to pull him.

07:29.416 --> 07:31.216
Get me a gaff real quick.

07:31.218 --> 07:32.517
[josh] there you go.

07:33.921 --> 07:34.953
Nice.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.521
[bleep] beautiful.

07:40.060 --> 07:42.194
All right, dude.
[bleep] did it.

07:42.196 --> 07:43.361
Right of the gaff, pal.

07:43.430 --> 07:44.463
[casey] man, I caught a fish.

07:44.564 --> 07:45.530
-Yeah!
-[casey] whoo!

07:45.532 --> 07:47.332
-[josh] before jeff.
-[laughs]

07:47.401 --> 07:48.934
[casey] you see
why it's so hard to bring up.

07:48.936 --> 07:50.302
Nose hooked him.
Look at that.

07:50.304 --> 07:51.736
Right up to the nose.

07:51.805 --> 07:54.973
Oh,
it's probably 30-40 pounder,
30-pounder anyway.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.108
[josh] oh, man.

07:57.110 --> 07:59.344
[casey] it's one more
towards the order.

07:59.413 --> 08:03.715
Yeah, but damn,
we need a bigger fish.

08:03.717 --> 08:05.116
A 30-pounder ahi.

08:05.118 --> 08:07.252
It's a nice start for the day,
but if you think about it,

08:07.321 --> 08:10.555
That's one percent of our
3,000 pound order.

08:10.624 --> 08:13.458
<i> Smaller fish are definitely</i>
<i> not going to cut it,</i>

08:13.560 --> 08:16.628
But it may mean
that we're closing
in on the school.

08:18.432 --> 08:19.564
[casey] want some heart,
buddy?

08:19.633 --> 08:21.500
[josh] no.

08:21.502 --> 08:22.801
I already had breakfast?

08:27.674 --> 08:29.941
[josh] yeah, hopefully,
hopefully jeff's catching too.

08:33.814 --> 08:36.448
I think we're gonna... I think
we're gonna just keep
heading south.

08:42.122 --> 08:43.989
[shane] oh, wow,
look at all that birds
up there.

08:43.991 --> 08:45.223
You see 'em up here.

08:45.225 --> 08:46.825
Yeah, right up there.

08:48.295 --> 08:50.462
Ooh, there was a big splash
right there, too.

08:50.531 --> 08:51.763
[jeff] yeah, look at that.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.298
We definitely need to get
some lines in now.

08:53.300 --> 08:54.432
[seagulls cawing]

08:54.534 --> 08:56.234
Lot of birds.
So, it's good.

08:56.303 --> 08:58.637
At least
we got something to fish.

08:58.705 --> 09:00.005
[shane] all right, good job.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.908
[jeff] hook a bait, quick,
and we can throw it out.

09:02.910 --> 09:05.010
-[shane] all right.
-[jeff] ready.

09:05.012 --> 09:06.711
Go ahead
and throw it out that way.

09:09.449 --> 09:11.116
[shane] <i> those birds</i>
<i> are going nuts, man.</i>

09:11.118 --> 09:12.951
[jeff] <i> yeah, they're going.</i>
<i> Yeah.</i>

09:13.053 --> 09:14.819
<i> But it looks really good,</i>
<i> though, shane.</i>

09:14.821 --> 09:16.288
-[shane] oh, dude.
-[jeff] yeah, absolutely.

09:16.290 --> 09:17.455
[shane] looks really good.

09:17.524 --> 09:18.957
So at least we know
that we're in the spot.

09:18.959 --> 09:21.526
We got to bait out
right in the center
of all these birds. So...

09:23.130 --> 09:24.663
[cell phone chimes]

09:24.698 --> 09:26.364
It's gotta be some taker here.

09:26.433 --> 09:27.933
[jeff]
it's gotta be something...

09:32.506 --> 09:34.839
Oh, sounds like they got one.

09:34.941 --> 09:37.943
One fish,
says about 25-30 pounds.

09:37.945 --> 09:39.945
In casey's world
that's probably about 15, 10.

09:39.947 --> 09:42.414
[shane laughs]

09:42.416 --> 09:44.416
So, yeah.

09:44.418 --> 09:46.451
We need a... We need
a little bit bigger fish
than that.

09:46.553 --> 09:49.321
It's not even gonna buy him
a lucky sandwich to catch
another fish.

09:49.323 --> 09:51.222
[shane laughing]

10:05.439 --> 10:08.506
[fishing rod reeling]

10:08.508 --> 10:09.708
[shane] got something.

10:09.710 --> 10:11.309
That's a fish right there?

10:13.347 --> 10:15.213
[fishing rod reeling]

10:17.317 --> 10:18.550
This is a big fish, dude.

10:18.619 --> 10:20.719
This is a [bleep] monster,
it's a big yellow,

10:20.721 --> 10:21.953
Big ahi.

10:31.632 --> 10:33.031
[fishing rod reeling]

10:33.033 --> 10:35.834
[jeff] we're down
the middle [bleep] line, dude.

10:35.935 --> 10:37.035
[shane] [bleep] did you get?

10:37.137 --> 10:38.436
<i> As soon as</i>
<i> we hooked this monster,</i>

10:38.505 --> 10:41.039
<i> This thing just</i>
<i> took off running.</i>

10:42.909 --> 10:44.943
<i> So, picture yourself</i>
<i> flying a kite.</i>

10:45.045 --> 10:48.246
And if that kite takes off
and you can't control it,

10:48.348 --> 10:50.448
<i> All you're left</i>
<i> with is an empty spool.</i>

10:50.517 --> 10:53.151
<i> This fish is more than</i>
<i> strong enough</i>
<i> to break the line,</i>

10:53.220 --> 10:54.352
And it's spooked.

10:55.956 --> 10:57.422
I've never had a fish
take me down

10:57.424 --> 10:58.923
On the bottom of a reel
like that before.

11:01.962 --> 11:05.030
[bleep] spired my damn hand.

11:05.032 --> 11:07.399
Okay, so this is
what I want you to do.

11:07.401 --> 11:09.334
I'm going to need
the leader of this fish

11:09.436 --> 11:10.935
And I'm going to let
you gaff it.

11:12.239 --> 11:15.373
You're going to try to
put this hook right here.

11:15.375 --> 11:16.808
-In the back of his head?
-No.

11:16.810 --> 11:18.510
Right here in his head
somewhere in his gill plate.

11:18.512 --> 11:20.211
Oh, okay. That's what you're
going to need to do.

11:20.213 --> 11:21.813
-Right?
-[shane] right.

11:21.815 --> 11:24.949
-[jeff] he's coming up.
-[monitor beeping]

11:25.051 --> 11:26.284
[shane] oh, no.

11:26.319 --> 11:29.220
[jeff] <i> we got a shark,</i>
<i> bro, chasing our fish.</i>

11:43.003 --> 11:44.335
This is a big fish, dude.

11:46.006 --> 11:49.340
This is a[bleep] monster,
it's a big yellow,

11:49.409 --> 11:50.508
Big ahi.

11:52.546 --> 11:53.712
He's coming up.

11:55.949 --> 11:57.248
[shane] oh, no.

11:57.317 --> 12:00.118
[jeff] we got a shark,
bro, chasing our fish.

12:03.657 --> 12:05.657
<i> We have a huge ahi</i>
<i> on the line.</i>

12:06.693 --> 12:08.860
<i> Holy</i>  [bleep].

12:08.929 --> 12:11.629
Problem is we're not
the only ones hunting it.

12:14.501 --> 12:15.900
[jeff] <i> I don't like</i>
<i> this at all.</i>

12:17.037 --> 12:18.837
[jeff grunts] oh [bleep].

12:21.408 --> 12:23.808
[shane] that thing
just took off all of a sudden.

12:23.810 --> 12:26.644
[jeff] so, something
might have happened
to this guy.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.313
He might have got
whacked by a shark.

12:31.017 --> 12:32.517
[shane] <i> yeah,</i>
<i> he got whacked, man.</i>

12:34.521 --> 12:35.620
[jeff] wow.

12:36.957 --> 12:38.022
[shane] okay, get him.

12:39.326 --> 12:41.226
[jeff] nice, man.
Nice.

12:42.729 --> 12:44.062
This guy's ruined.

12:45.432 --> 12:46.831
He was running from the shark.

12:48.034 --> 12:49.100
[shane] damn!

12:51.204 --> 12:52.437
[jeff] let's get in the boat.

12:55.909 --> 12:57.809
[jeff grunts]
[bleep]

12:57.811 --> 13:00.445
[jeff]
oh, that fish is probably
about 130 pounds.

13:02.415 --> 13:04.014
[shane] what do you do
with this?

13:05.519 --> 13:09.053
[jeff] we'll still probably
get 40 pounds of fillet out
of this thing.

13:09.055 --> 13:11.723
The rest of it will probably
give it back to the ocean.

13:11.725 --> 13:13.057
-You know what I mean?
-[shane] mm-hmm.

13:13.126 --> 13:14.759
But that's life.

13:16.096 --> 13:17.729
You did everything perfect,
bud.

13:17.731 --> 13:19.330
That was awesome.
Here, you know what?

13:22.402 --> 13:23.701
[laughs]

13:25.739 --> 13:27.806
You can't say you
didn't catch a fish, bud.

13:27.808 --> 13:30.408
[both laughing]

13:30.410 --> 13:32.510
-That's great, man.
-All right.

13:32.512 --> 13:34.612
I told you, I get you bloody
before I took you home.

13:34.614 --> 13:36.214
[shane] yeah, you delivered.

13:37.417 --> 13:39.818
[jeff] hopefully,
we can get another bite.

13:39.820 --> 13:42.453
Get back to work
and try to complete
this order, man.

13:45.725 --> 13:46.825
[fishing rod reeling]

13:46.827 --> 13:48.960
[josh] all right.
Put this on.

13:50.864 --> 13:52.597
[casey] here
he's coming towards us.

13:52.599 --> 13:54.032
-[josh] all right, dude.
-[casey] gaff?

13:55.802 --> 13:57.802
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
Get ready? Get ready?

13:59.739 --> 14:01.806
Nice.
Good job.

14:01.808 --> 14:03.107
Straight to the box.

14:07.314 --> 14:08.646
Every pound counts.

14:10.851 --> 14:12.650
Indianapolis pinnacles
performing okay,

14:12.752 --> 14:14.719
But the fish
aren't that large, so,

14:14.721 --> 14:15.954
We need big fish.

14:17.190 --> 14:19.157
[casey speaking]

14:19.259 --> 14:21.893
[josh] I wonder
how shane's doing
over at jeff's boat?

14:21.895 --> 14:24.262
[seagulls cawing]

14:24.364 --> 14:26.631
[shane] there's some birds
flying around over here.

14:26.633 --> 14:28.032
It doesn't look bad,
it looks...

14:28.034 --> 14:29.500
-Right in front of us.
-[shane] yeah.

14:29.502 --> 14:30.702
[fishing rod reeling]

14:30.704 --> 14:32.203
-[shane] right there.
-[jeff] [indistinct]

14:34.741 --> 14:36.307
That was a big splash.

14:36.309 --> 14:37.709
We're on.

14:37.711 --> 14:39.310
That's a marlin.
Tuna is jumping.

14:39.312 --> 14:40.945
[shane] oh, [bleep].

14:42.616 --> 14:44.949
[jeff] this fish might not be
a valuable fish for barry,

14:45.051 --> 14:46.951
But this is a valuable fish
for us here in kona.

14:47.053 --> 14:49.420
A lot of people
want marlin right now,
all right.

14:50.523 --> 14:52.423
[shane] <i> phil always wanted</i>
<i> to catch a marlin.</i>

14:52.425 --> 14:55.026
<i> So, when josh caught a marli</i>
<i> it was a way to honor him.</i>

14:56.529 --> 14:57.962
<i> If I could land one,</i>

14:58.031 --> 15:00.131
That could be
something that me
and josh could share.

15:00.133 --> 15:01.699
[fishing rod reeling]

15:03.236 --> 15:04.702
[shane] oh, look at him go.

15:06.039 --> 15:07.305
[jeff] nice.
That's a big one.

15:07.307 --> 15:08.740
[shane] oh, he's a bad boy.
Look at him.

15:08.808 --> 15:10.708
[jeff] all right, shane.
We'll have you on this reel.
Okay?

15:10.710 --> 15:12.310
-[shane] all right.
-[jeff] start cranking now.

15:12.312 --> 15:13.444
-Okay?
-[shane] yeah.

15:13.513 --> 15:14.946
[jeff] crank hard,
crank hard, crank hard.

15:21.855 --> 15:23.488
[jeff] let me see something,
let me see something.

15:23.490 --> 15:24.856
Come off the reel.

15:27.227 --> 15:28.826
Yeah, it came off.

15:33.433 --> 15:36.200
Just in seconds, bam!

15:36.202 --> 15:39.037
Ooh, what?

15:39.105 --> 15:40.905
It's all right, man.

15:40.907 --> 15:42.106
That's all it goes, guy.

15:43.944 --> 15:45.710
That was a big fish.
See that fish jumping?

15:45.712 --> 15:47.045
-[shane] oh, hell, yeah.
-[jeff] yeah.

15:48.214 --> 15:49.714
[shane] how big do
you think he was?

15:49.716 --> 15:52.216
[jeff] he looks
about 300-350, maybe.

15:52.218 --> 15:53.518
Oh, no.

15:54.821 --> 15:57.155
Oh, that would have been nice.

15:57.256 --> 15:58.823
[jeff] it was easy.
Everybody would do it.

16:00.126 --> 16:01.859
Oh, man.

16:01.928 --> 16:03.394
Guess, I know how phil feels,

16:03.396 --> 16:06.030
And I wonder
how many he lost, you know.

16:06.032 --> 16:08.499
I don't know, man,
I just really want to get
one for him, you know?

16:10.003 --> 16:13.204
You know, we just keep
giving it everything we got.

16:13.206 --> 16:15.840
And, you know,
the time's right,

16:15.942 --> 16:17.508
Maybe phil will shine
some light down on you.

16:17.510 --> 16:19.744
Maybe we can get
one before you leave.

16:19.813 --> 16:21.512
[shane] <i> all the lines</i>
<i> that I have rigged right no</i>

16:21.514 --> 16:24.615
Are all set up
for catching ahi
for this vegas order.

16:24.617 --> 16:27.352
It's going to be tough
to reel in a marlin.

16:27.420 --> 16:30.021
But shane handled himself
well today, so who knows?

16:31.224 --> 16:32.590
[jeff] we're going home.

16:32.592 --> 16:34.959
As far as this order goes,
we're still at square one.

16:41.935 --> 16:45.136
[josh] jeff's idea was right,
I think.

16:45.171 --> 16:48.206
But we just didn't get
what we needed.

16:48.208 --> 16:49.340
[casey] all right,
let's head in.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.543
We're going home.

16:52.645 --> 16:54.212
[josh] <i> everyone</i>
<i> is definitely deflated.</i>

16:55.448 --> 16:57.615
<i> The indianapolis pinnacle</i>
<i> was a great idea,</i>

16:57.617 --> 16:59.317
<i> But we didn't find</i>
<i> school there.</i>

17:01.488 --> 17:04.055
Just seems like we're always
one step behind the fish.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.636
What we need to do
is tap into a network

17:18.705 --> 17:23.107
That's going to give us
information that happens
even on the hour,

17:23.109 --> 17:25.209
So that when it's biting,
we're there.

17:26.746 --> 17:30.114
[shane] <i> there's still</i>
<i> one card in my hand</i>
<i> that I haven't played.</i>

17:30.116 --> 17:32.450
But I knew there might be
a time when I need it.

17:34.287 --> 17:35.420
[josh] where are we headed?

17:36.623 --> 17:37.955
I got somebody down
at miloli'I.

17:38.024 --> 17:40.124
I want you to meet.

17:40.126 --> 17:42.093
Nelson kahele,

17:42.095 --> 17:44.028
He's a really good friend
of my dad,

17:44.030 --> 17:46.397
Friend of my family,
he's a friend to me.

17:46.399 --> 17:50.701
And he's fished out
of the south kona
his whole entire life.

17:53.206 --> 17:55.907
[shane] <i> milil's is located</i>
<i> in south kona.</i>

17:55.909 --> 17:58.943
<i> It's the last traditional</i>
<i> fishing village in hawaii.</i>

17:59.012 --> 18:00.411
They don't have power.

18:00.413 --> 18:02.413
They live
off of catchment water.

18:02.415 --> 18:03.648
They're self-sustaining.

18:05.752 --> 18:07.618
<i> And the fishermen,</i>

18:07.620 --> 18:10.221
They don't give out
information easy.

18:10.223 --> 18:11.823
[josh]
<i> and this is where I'm from,</i>
<i> man.</i>

18:11.825 --> 18:14.058
Born and raised on here.

18:14.060 --> 18:15.827
Why haven't we come here
before?

18:18.731 --> 18:20.364
I have a hard time
coming down here.

18:22.402 --> 18:25.236
I was 16 when I left miloli'I.

18:25.305 --> 18:26.403
[josh] what happened?

18:28.708 --> 18:32.844
For my dad, fishing just
wasn't going to cut it.

18:32.912 --> 18:35.513
Um...[bleep]

18:36.816 --> 18:40.118
Broke his heart, broke mine.

18:40.120 --> 18:42.420
[shane]
<i> it wasn't just my father</i>
<i> leaving miloli'I.</i>

18:43.623 --> 18:48.326
<i> It was leaving his entire</i>
<i> lifestyle that he grew up in</i>

18:49.429 --> 18:50.661
<i> It was about survival.</i>

18:52.966 --> 18:56.534
But everybody down
in miloli'I was family.

18:57.804 --> 19:00.505
<i> And when we left,</i>
<i> it created some hard feeling</i>

19:02.642 --> 19:04.408
I hope this works.

19:04.410 --> 19:05.510
Yeah, me too.

19:06.746 --> 19:08.112
See this almost right here.

19:10.450 --> 19:12.150
[josh] it's brilliant today.

19:12.251 --> 19:15.820
[jeff] no, I think
if he's approached
the right way,

19:15.822 --> 19:17.155
Maybe he'll help us out.

19:22.829 --> 19:24.862
Hey.
How are you?

19:24.931 --> 19:26.129
[nelson] good, good, good.

19:26.131 --> 19:27.765
[jeff]
thank you for having us.
I appreciate it.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.233
Yeah...

19:29.335 --> 19:30.501
This is josh.
Josh, this is nelson.

19:30.503 --> 19:31.636
[josh] how are you doing,
my man?

19:31.737 --> 19:33.337
-Nice to meet you, brother.
-Nice to meet you too.

19:33.406 --> 19:38.943
This is one of the last true
ohana's from the big island.

19:39.045 --> 19:40.344
Yeah, yeah.

19:40.413 --> 19:41.512
[laughs]

19:43.216 --> 19:46.050
I was kind of explaining
to josh that, you know,

19:46.152 --> 19:48.819
Success on the water comes
with having a good network.

19:50.223 --> 19:53.324
I don't really
give information
out to anybody.

19:53.326 --> 19:57.428
If I feel that I don't like
to help you,

19:57.430 --> 19:59.430
I will tell you straight.

19:59.432 --> 20:00.665
[dog barking]

20:02.602 --> 20:04.802
Let me take you down,
take you guys down

20:04.804 --> 20:11.209
And show you
where everything started
in our, our family here.

20:11.211 --> 20:12.610
[josh] okay.

20:14.647 --> 20:16.814
[nelson]
<i> my, my grandfather, my dad,</i>

20:16.816 --> 20:18.816
My great grandfather, then,

20:18.818 --> 20:20.851
They all used
to fish off of this.

20:20.953 --> 20:22.186
-[josh] really?
-[nelson] yeah.

20:22.255 --> 20:26.290
This was how we used to go out
and catch opelu and even ahi.

20:26.292 --> 20:28.159
We seal this.

20:28.228 --> 20:29.527
[josh] it's crazy.

20:29.529 --> 20:31.629
A lot of memories, yeah?

20:31.631 --> 20:34.098
-No.
-A lot of memories, you know?

20:34.100 --> 20:38.035
This place made me the person
that I am today,
and so has he.

20:38.037 --> 20:39.804
And that was why I wanted
you to meet him.

20:40.907 --> 20:42.039
You know where y'all?

20:44.043 --> 20:46.410
You know this is your home.

20:46.412 --> 20:47.645
Thank you.

20:47.714 --> 20:49.814
You know, you cannot forget
your roots, you know.

20:51.351 --> 20:53.651
We got to get out there
and do what we've got
to do

20:53.720 --> 20:56.320
To support our family, yeah?

20:56.322 --> 20:57.455
Yeah, I mean,

20:57.556 --> 21:00.258
And I've made
a lot of sacrifices too.

21:00.359 --> 21:03.060
You know, and I looked
at a lot of the stuff
my dad did.

21:04.130 --> 21:06.330
It didn't make
any sense until now.

21:06.332 --> 21:08.633
You know, you got
to provide for your family.

21:08.734 --> 21:11.602
You got to make decisions
for other people's families.

21:11.604 --> 21:14.605
You know, it's... It's hard.

21:14.607 --> 21:16.440
[nelson] but that was
your father's dream. Yeah?

21:16.509 --> 21:18.042
My father's dream, yeah.

21:20.013 --> 21:24.949
I appreciate this
and I've learned a lot
about your guys industry,

21:25.051 --> 21:26.817
Catch fish,
respect on the ocean.

21:26.819 --> 21:28.519
[nelson nodding head]

21:28.521 --> 21:29.954
So, what do you think,
you know?

21:29.956 --> 21:31.322
Can I call on you for help?

21:38.865 --> 21:42.300
If we ever needed help,
you know,
just for information.

21:43.603 --> 21:46.237
Now, do you think
you can help us?

21:46.339 --> 21:49.407
<i> Our weekly order's coming u</i>
<i> pretty quick.</i>

21:49.409 --> 21:51.509
<i> So, jeff brought me</i>
<i> to his hometown,</i>

21:51.511 --> 21:56.647
Thinking maybe they might
just let me into their
fishing network.

21:56.749 --> 21:57.782
So, what do you think?

21:57.784 --> 21:59.617
You know,
can I call on you for help?

22:02.855 --> 22:06.857
Honestly, it took me 55 years

22:08.361 --> 22:10.728
To realize what family
was all about, yeah.

22:11.931 --> 22:14.065
I follow your story.

22:14.100 --> 22:19.804
Your dad had on a history
of how he became
the person he is, you know.

22:19.806 --> 22:21.405
And he only was handing
it down to you.

22:21.407 --> 22:22.606
[josh] yeah.

22:22.608 --> 22:26.043
Same like for me,
same like for jeff.
You know?

22:27.847 --> 22:30.047
He knows
I'm always here for him.

22:30.116 --> 22:33.451
And it's the same way we do,
you know? So...

22:36.255 --> 22:38.356
[nelson speaking]

22:38.391 --> 22:39.623
Okay.

22:39.625 --> 22:41.425
I appreciate you,
man, very much.

22:41.427 --> 22:43.928
I appreciate your time.

22:43.930 --> 22:46.697
<i> Seeing where jeff came from</i>
<i> and how deep his roots</i>
<i> are here.</i>

22:46.699 --> 22:50.034
Just makes me understand
why this community means
so much to him

22:50.136 --> 22:53.104
<i> And why he doesn't want</i>
<i> to leave behind.</i>

22:53.106 --> 22:56.407
<i> Hopefully, nelson's network</i>
<i> will help keep our</i>
<i> operation alive.</i>

23:03.816 --> 23:05.149
[shane]
can we throw it out, right?

23:06.352 --> 23:07.618
[jeff] we gotta make
things happen.

23:14.660 --> 23:16.127
[josh] he seems to be
dancing pretty good.

23:16.129 --> 23:17.728
He's doing a little song
and dance down there,

23:17.730 --> 23:18.963
Flipping some tail.

23:22.301 --> 23:24.635
[casey] freakin' out.
Really freakin' out.

23:26.839 --> 23:28.239
<i> About to get hammered.</i>

23:29.842 --> 23:31.542
[josh] that pole
is shaking like a [bleep]

23:37.550 --> 23:40.050
[fishing rod reeling]

23:40.052 --> 23:41.519
[casey] oh, run.

23:41.521 --> 23:42.820
[josh] all right.

23:45.024 --> 23:46.524
[casey] clear the shot,
clear the shot.

23:46.526 --> 23:50.060
[josh] okay.
Run.

23:50.162 --> 23:51.762
Run big.

23:51.831 --> 23:53.764
All right, I got this one.

23:53.800 --> 23:54.998
[casey] saw some marks.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.701
We got bit quick there,
that was pretty impressive.

23:57.703 --> 23:59.537
[josh] yeah, baby!
We got some action.

23:59.638 --> 24:00.704
Thank god.

24:02.008 --> 24:03.207
We need it.

24:04.911 --> 24:06.710
Oh, there.
I see it back there.

24:09.048 --> 24:10.815
All right.
Here we go.

24:11.818 --> 24:13.017
Oh, he's pissed.

24:15.521 --> 24:19.623
[cell phone ringing]

24:19.625 --> 24:21.058
Hey, what's happening, nelson?

24:23.329 --> 24:25.129
Okay.

24:25.131 --> 24:27.364
This could be it, buddy.

24:27.433 --> 24:29.733
[josh] god, I hope so,
hopefully...

24:32.238 --> 24:33.537
We wore him out.

24:33.606 --> 24:35.206
[casey] no, no.
He's already on the surface.

24:35.208 --> 24:36.941
It's got to be "no, no."

24:36.943 --> 24:39.844
[josh] oh, yeah.
That's definitely a no, no.

24:39.945 --> 24:41.512
Well,
I'll tell casey and josh.

24:43.416 --> 24:45.249
All right, man, thank you.
I appreciate it.

24:45.318 --> 24:47.117
Good bye.

24:47.119 --> 24:48.219
[shane speaking]

24:48.221 --> 24:49.420
[josh] oh,
just give me that gaff.

24:49.422 --> 24:50.855
Where's that gaff?

24:54.560 --> 24:56.627
[josh grunts]

24:56.629 --> 24:58.295
[josh speaking]

24:58.297 --> 25:02.500
[bleep]
<i> well, that's a nice ono.</i>

25:02.502 --> 25:04.735
But it's another small fish.

25:04.804 --> 25:06.804
<i> I'm starting to feel like</i>
<i> it's too little, too late.</i>

25:06.806 --> 25:09.707
[seagulls cawing]

25:09.709 --> 25:13.344
Well,
back to the drawing board.

25:14.647 --> 25:15.946
[fishing rod reeling]

25:16.015 --> 25:17.214
[cell phone ringing]

25:17.216 --> 25:18.949
[casey] dude, somebody's
got to light a fire here.

25:18.951 --> 25:20.150
[bleep] it ain't happening.

25:21.587 --> 25:22.820
[josh] yo.

25:22.822 --> 25:24.722
[jeff over the phone] nelson
called me and it sounded like

25:24.724 --> 25:27.224
Down south actually
has a little bit of fish,
so...

25:27.226 --> 25:28.359
All right, cool.

25:28.427 --> 25:30.060
Where are you taking
down south, buoys?

25:30.162 --> 25:31.529
[jeff] <i> yeah,</i>
<i> a couple of the buoys.</i>

25:31.531 --> 25:33.063
<i> Maybe you guys</i>
<i> want to run outside</i>

25:33.065 --> 25:34.899
<i> And check you and see</i>
<i> if there's anything there.</i>

25:34.901 --> 25:37.401
[josh] all right, cool.
I'll see you down there.

25:37.403 --> 25:38.936
[jeff] <i> all right, buddy.</i>
<i> See you down there.</i>

25:38.938 --> 25:40.170
Later.

25:40.172 --> 25:43.641
Hey, jeff just said that buoys
got some action [bleep].

25:43.742 --> 25:45.543
-Hell, yeah.
-[josh] all right, cool.

25:45.644 --> 25:47.611
[casey] let's go find
some fishies. Hit it.

25:47.613 --> 25:50.447
Don't get 600 horsepower
for nothing.

25:50.516 --> 25:53.551
[josh] <i> when the bite gets up</i>
<i> word travels fast in kona.</i>

25:53.652 --> 25:56.220
One of us has got to beat
the rest of the boats
that spot.

26:03.429 --> 26:05.029
We go right
where those birds are.

26:07.333 --> 26:09.500
That's a big ass pile
of birds over here.

26:14.407 --> 26:15.439
[monitor beeping]

26:15.541 --> 26:16.607
[casey]
live baits in the water.

26:16.609 --> 26:19.510
Live bait is in the water.
We get some marks too.

26:19.512 --> 26:21.045
[fishing rod reeling]

26:21.146 --> 26:22.413
[josh] yeah dude,
that's a lot of 'em.

26:23.816 --> 26:25.516
Look at that [bleep]

26:25.518 --> 26:27.351
Oh, that is a lot of big fish.

26:29.822 --> 26:31.121
Ooh!

26:31.123 --> 26:33.223
Fresh info.

26:33.225 --> 26:36.193
[monitor beeping]

26:36.195 --> 26:37.328
Good.

26:37.330 --> 26:39.997
Dude,
signs of life right here.

26:39.999 --> 26:41.332
It's a lot of 'em.

26:43.502 --> 26:45.502
Now that hot tip
might pay off.

26:47.807 --> 26:49.807
[distant seagull cawing]

26:52.945 --> 26:55.512
I definitely think
we've got some good intel,

26:55.514 --> 26:56.747
At least where we know
the fish are,

26:56.816 --> 26:58.616
Which is helpful.

26:58.618 --> 27:00.150
We're in the right spot,

27:00.252 --> 27:02.720
But we are running out of time
for getting that order
for barry,

27:02.722 --> 27:04.955
So it needs to happen today.

27:05.024 --> 27:06.256
It really does.

27:20.706 --> 27:22.706
[fishing rod reeling]

27:24.243 --> 27:25.509
[jeff] we're on.

27:28.314 --> 27:30.614
[shane] the marlin
jumping out of the water.

27:30.616 --> 27:32.516
Yeah, it's a marlin.

27:32.518 --> 27:34.018
[jeff]
pull that line right now.

27:37.790 --> 27:40.224
[shane]
<i> I can't lose another marlin</i>

27:40.226 --> 27:42.526
I know this isn't a fish
you send to vegas.

27:42.528 --> 27:44.228
<i> But if I can land this one,</i>

27:44.230 --> 27:46.664
Me and josh could honor
phil together.

27:46.732 --> 27:49.199
[jeff] he looked like
he's at least a couple
of hundred.

27:49.201 --> 27:51.201
I'm going to turn this thing
over to you in a minute,

27:51.203 --> 27:53.604
'cause I'm going to drive
because you got
a lot of line out.

27:53.606 --> 27:55.039
[shane] okay? All right.

27:56.409 --> 27:57.808
[jeff]
got to keep this line tight.

27:57.810 --> 28:00.210
As soon as the loop goes in it
and they're slacking.

28:00.212 --> 28:03.347
The route this is
a hundred percent chance
this fish will come off.

28:03.416 --> 28:05.048
[shane] all right.

28:05.050 --> 28:06.950
You can't get carried away
and you can't get too
aggressive on the reel.

28:06.952 --> 28:08.952
If you get too aggressive
on the reel, you'll snap
the line.

28:08.954 --> 28:10.354
All right.
So let them take it, huh?

28:10.422 --> 28:11.822
Yeah.

28:11.824 --> 28:13.424
-You ready?
-[shane] all right.

28:15.227 --> 28:19.229
Right.
Easy, easy.

28:19.231 --> 28:21.198
Don't make the rod go back
and forth like that,

28:21.200 --> 28:22.399
Keep the rod straight.

28:22.401 --> 28:23.934
-[shane] okay.
-[jeff] okay?

28:29.642 --> 28:32.142
[jeff] when that line
stands up like that,

28:32.211 --> 28:34.111
He's pissed.

28:34.113 --> 28:37.614
Yeah. I can tell he's pissed,
he's been pulling a lot.

28:37.616 --> 28:39.750
He's taking line, that's fine.
Let him take line.

28:41.954 --> 28:43.187
You want to wear
this fish out,

28:43.189 --> 28:45.055
So that when we get him close.

28:45.157 --> 28:47.858
He's not a nightmare
by the boat because these
guys are dangerous.

28:53.232 --> 28:54.798
Pay attention.
Watch the rod.

28:54.800 --> 28:56.100
When they're slack, you reel.

28:56.102 --> 28:58.102
When you're tight,
like this, you breathe,

28:58.104 --> 28:59.803
You breathe, you breathe.

29:01.807 --> 29:03.107
Go, get him.

29:06.712 --> 29:09.747
[fish rod reeling back]
[bleep]

29:11.217 --> 29:13.150
[jeff] it's still there?

29:13.219 --> 29:15.052
I don't think so.

29:15.154 --> 29:16.420
Let me see.

29:22.228 --> 29:23.594
-It came off.
-No, he's there.

29:23.596 --> 29:25.362
You've got to keep
the rod tight.

29:25.464 --> 29:27.131
-Got to keep 'em tight, dude.
-[shane] all right.

29:27.133 --> 29:28.265
[jeff] come on, buddy.
Breathe.

29:28.333 --> 29:29.733
You can't go on here
like that, okay?

29:29.835 --> 29:31.301
-All right.
-We cannot lose this fish.

29:38.110 --> 29:40.711
[jeff] breathe,
breathe, you breathe.

29:42.915 --> 29:44.848
Still there?

29:44.917 --> 29:46.416
I don't think so.

29:46.418 --> 29:47.818
We'll see.

29:53.626 --> 29:55.292
-It came off.
-No, he's there.

29:55.294 --> 29:56.927
You've got to keep
the rod tight.

29:56.929 --> 29:58.729
-Got to keep 'em tight, dude.
-[shane] all right.

29:58.731 --> 29:59.897
[jeff] come on, buddy.
Breathe.

29:59.899 --> 30:01.365
You can't go on here
like that, okay?

30:01.433 --> 30:02.900
-We cannot lose this fish.
-[shane] all right.

30:08.607 --> 30:10.808
You know, phil always
wanted a marlin,

30:11.911 --> 30:13.043
<i> So I want to catch it for us</i>

30:13.112 --> 30:14.344
<i> And I want to catch it</i>
<i> for him.</i>

30:16.849 --> 30:18.515
[jeff]
don't even touch the line
when he's pulling.

30:18.517 --> 30:19.817
Let him go.

30:19.819 --> 30:21.318
When the rod comes up
like that,

30:21.320 --> 30:23.353
That's when you reel.
Perfect. Awesome.

30:23.455 --> 30:26.056
Timing is everything
on a big fish.

30:26.058 --> 30:27.424
Perfect.
Perfect.

30:29.728 --> 30:31.361
Okay.
He's settling down.

30:31.463 --> 30:33.263
This is where we want him.
We want him just like this.

30:33.365 --> 30:34.531
Okay, right?

30:38.704 --> 30:40.437
Stay smooth.
Stay smooth.

30:42.608 --> 30:44.308
Good.

30:44.310 --> 30:45.509
Perfect.

30:47.313 --> 30:48.412
[shane] I see him.

30:52.518 --> 30:54.017
[jeff screams]

31:11.303 --> 31:12.803
[jeff] okay, ready?
He's coming in.

31:12.805 --> 31:15.739
Ready? One, two, three.

31:18.410 --> 31:19.810
-[shane] nice fish.
-[jeff] ooh!

31:19.812 --> 31:24.248
This will be about 200.
That's 200? All right.

31:24.349 --> 31:25.749
-First marlin.
-[jeff] good job, buddy.

31:25.818 --> 31:27.918
First marlin.
Beautiful fish.

31:27.920 --> 31:29.353
[shane] that's awesome.

31:29.421 --> 31:31.221
So, this fish,
I'm not going to
have a problem.

31:31.223 --> 31:33.223
We're not going
to send it to vegas.

31:33.225 --> 31:34.858
We'll send this one.
We'll keep this one here.

31:34.927 --> 31:36.226
We'll make
a lot of people happy.

31:36.228 --> 31:38.195
A lot of business
will be stoked on this.

31:38.197 --> 31:39.863
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

31:39.965 --> 31:42.199
[shane] <i> I know this fish</i>
<i> is going to feed</i>
<i> some people,</i>

31:42.201 --> 31:44.301
But I can't wait to tell
my brother about it.

31:46.305 --> 31:50.374
[jeff] aumakua,
thank you so much for
blessing us with this fish.

31:50.376 --> 31:52.009
We definitely
worked hard for it.

31:55.114 --> 31:56.413
-[shane] hold on, buddy.
-[shane sighs]

31:56.415 --> 31:57.714
[jeff] good job, man.
That was awesome.

31:57.716 --> 32:00.350
-Thank you. Great coach.
-You did epic.

32:00.419 --> 32:02.252
You did great, man.

32:02.354 --> 32:03.453
Why don't you go tell
your brother?

32:03.555 --> 32:04.721
Tell him that you caught
a marlin.

32:04.723 --> 32:05.923
[shane laughs]

32:05.925 --> 32:08.058
[shane] oh,
yeah, that was great.

32:08.127 --> 32:11.628
-[jeff sighs]
-that was for you, phil.

32:11.630 --> 32:12.763
[jeff] that was phil's dream,

32:12.831 --> 32:14.865
That was your dad's dream
right there. You know?

32:14.933 --> 32:16.900
[shane] yeah. I think I made
him proud today too, man.

32:16.902 --> 32:18.936
-I do.
-He's probably
looking down on you.

32:18.938 --> 32:20.604
Your brother is going to be
blown away.

32:24.310 --> 32:27.711
[cell phone ringing]

32:29.949 --> 32:32.049
[shane over the phone]
<i> hey, what's going on, josh?</i>

32:32.150 --> 32:34.217
What's going on, bud?

32:34.219 --> 32:36.720
[shane over the phone]
well, it's just letting
you know that,

32:36.722 --> 32:39.823
I just reeled in a nice
looking marlin, bro.

32:39.825 --> 32:41.425
Finally, did it.

32:41.427 --> 32:44.261
-They got a marlin.
-[casey] you got a marlin?

32:44.330 --> 32:45.629
[shane over the phone]
<i> I got a marlin.</i>

32:45.631 --> 32:47.664
Nice.
Air high-five, man.

32:47.733 --> 32:50.600
[shane laughs]
it's about a 200-pounder.

32:50.602 --> 32:52.302
This thing was a fight, man.

32:52.304 --> 32:53.437
I'll tell you what.

32:53.505 --> 32:55.405
That's my first marlin, man.

32:55.407 --> 32:56.840
[casey] nice.
Right on, brother.

32:56.942 --> 32:58.041
Nice job, man.

32:58.043 --> 32:59.910
Well, I think... I think
the old man is proud of me.

32:59.912 --> 33:02.012
I think... I think he saw
this today, man.

33:02.014 --> 33:04.081
Congratulations, pal.

33:04.083 --> 33:05.248
All right, brother.

33:05.350 --> 33:08.452
Well, I'll see you at the dock
when we get done here.

33:08.553 --> 33:09.619
All right.

33:09.621 --> 33:10.954
Later. Bye.

33:12.057 --> 33:13.323
[casey] nice.

33:14.526 --> 33:17.327
Catching a marlin
was something my dad
always dreamed of.

33:17.329 --> 33:20.230
<i> Now, two of his sons</i>
<i> brought one on the boat</i>
<i> in his honor.</i>

33:21.500 --> 33:24.234
I'm sure he's looking down
and he's probably smiling.

33:25.904 --> 33:27.637
<i> Maybe it's time</i>
<i> for a cocktail.</i>

33:27.706 --> 33:29.406
<i> We need to do better.</i>

33:29.408 --> 33:32.542
<i> But even though</i>
<i> nelson's tip landed us</i>
<i> the biggest fish of the year</i>

33:33.946 --> 33:36.113
<i> Marlin does not go to vegas</i>

33:36.115 --> 33:37.614
Another day is gone,

33:37.616 --> 33:42.652
Which means
we are out of time, again.

33:42.754 --> 33:45.822
[barry on phone] <i> I got to d</i>
<i> what I got to do to make</i>
<i> this place run.</i>

33:45.824 --> 33:47.357
[josh] <i> mm-hmm.</i>

33:47.359 --> 33:49.693
[barry on phone]
<i> if I can't depend on you,</i>
<i> which I wanted to...</i>

33:49.695 --> 33:51.094
[josh] <i> yeah.</i>

33:51.096 --> 33:52.729
[barry on phone] <i> ...But I mu</i>
<i> tell you right now,</i>

33:52.731 --> 33:55.198
<i> -I'm going to put</i>
<i> this to rest.</i>
-[josh] come on.

33:55.200 --> 33:56.633
Well...
And it's fishing, barry.

33:57.936 --> 34:00.003
[barry on phone] <i> josh, I mea</i>
<i> I can't do this, no more, ma</i>

34:04.043 --> 34:05.208
Yeah. All right.

34:05.210 --> 34:06.743
[barry on phone]
<i> I just got to look elsewhere</i>

34:06.812 --> 34:08.111
Yeah, I got it.

34:08.113 --> 34:10.213
[barry on phone] <i> I got to go</i>
<i> I'll see you later.</i>

34:10.315 --> 34:12.549
All right.
Talk to you later.

34:16.221 --> 34:18.255
Well, that was barry

34:18.356 --> 34:22.759
And he is not excited
about the delays.

34:22.828 --> 34:26.196
So, you know,

34:26.198 --> 34:28.465
He's basically stopping
with the orders.

34:30.769 --> 34:32.936
Well, the good news is,
is that I mean,

34:32.938 --> 34:34.738
Our hawaii market is booming.

34:34.807 --> 34:36.840
So, I mean, to me,
it's a blessing in disguise.

34:36.942 --> 34:39.242
Let's just start working
with these guys locally and...

34:39.344 --> 34:41.044
The whole reason
that my dad came here

34:41.113 --> 34:43.346
Is because he had
all his eggs in one basket.

34:43.448 --> 34:45.415
And that fishery failed.

34:45.417 --> 34:47.651
And I don't want to do
the same thing.

34:47.752 --> 34:51.955
I need to figure out
how we can also serve
as low 48.

34:52.024 --> 34:53.723
There has to be another way.

34:53.725 --> 34:55.659
I got to head back
to seattle and regroup.

34:58.130 --> 35:00.330
I've made up my mind,
you know, I needed to do this.

35:06.004 --> 35:07.637
So you want to leave
hawaii right now?

35:07.739 --> 35:09.005
You want to leave
our business?

35:18.851 --> 35:21.952
This is where we all began
fishing out of this.

35:22.053 --> 35:26.123
My dad used to come in
with the canoe so filled
with opelu on top.

35:26.125 --> 35:28.225
The canoe used to swamp
right there.

35:28.227 --> 35:30.160
-[josh] really?
-Yeah.

35:30.229 --> 35:33.096
[josh] <i> you know all the thin</i>
<i> I learned about nelson,</i>

35:33.098 --> 35:37.200
<i> Including the fact he used</i>
<i> to catch opelu</i>
<i> and ahi from a canoe.</i>

35:37.202 --> 35:39.636
I used to... I used to love
watching your father,

35:39.705 --> 35:43.440
You know, watching
you guys catching crab.

35:43.542 --> 35:46.343
The coolest thing is not only
did he know about my dad,

35:46.411 --> 35:49.412
But he understood the bond
between me and my father.

35:49.414 --> 35:50.614
And your dad, you know,

35:50.616 --> 35:54.251
Your dad handing
it down to you, you know.

35:54.352 --> 36:00.056
That's your father's legacy
and I hope you carry them on.

36:02.294 --> 36:04.127
You get tired of fishing
for the tunas.

36:04.129 --> 36:05.395
You can always come up,

36:05.397 --> 36:08.131
Try the crabs
a little bit bigger than
the kona crab.

36:08.133 --> 36:10.534
That's all right, I rather you
bring the crab to me.

36:10.635 --> 36:12.102
-Yeah.
-[all laughing]

36:12.104 --> 36:13.803
[josh] hey, you got it bro.

36:13.805 --> 36:15.539
[nelson] in our case,
we go up there on that boat.

36:15.607 --> 36:17.107
[all laughing]

36:19.378 --> 36:23.613
I need to figure out
how we can also service
little 48.

36:23.682 --> 36:25.182
There has to be another way.

36:25.184 --> 36:27.117
I got to head back
to seattle and regroup.

36:28.320 --> 36:30.620
I've made up my mind,
you know, I needed to do this.

36:33.292 --> 36:34.958
So you want to leave
hawaii right now?

36:34.960 --> 36:36.393
You want to leave
our business?

36:38.230 --> 36:40.997
<i> I love jeff.</i>
<i> I love casey.</i>

36:40.999 --> 36:43.800
<i> God, we've been through</i>
[bleep] <i> together.</i>

36:43.802 --> 36:46.603
But at this point, if hawaii
isn't supplying what we need,

36:46.605 --> 36:49.005
Then I'm going to go find it
on my own.

36:49.007 --> 36:52.042
Even if you know,
I got to go alone.

36:52.044 --> 36:55.979
We have so many people
that are here willing to work
with us and help us out,

36:55.981 --> 36:59.082
And we've put so much
into this here now.

36:59.084 --> 37:00.517
And now you want to leave?

37:02.521 --> 37:05.322
The bottom line
is that my dad,

37:05.324 --> 37:07.090
He diversified things.

37:07.092 --> 37:08.525
There has to be
another avenue.

37:08.527 --> 37:09.726
There has to be another way.

37:10.996 --> 37:12.128
I have to do this.

37:13.799 --> 37:16.967
And, you know,
and maybe later on down
the road,

37:16.969 --> 37:18.301
This can save our asses.

37:19.705 --> 37:21.304
I don't know.
The way I look at it,

37:21.306 --> 37:22.772
One of the things your
dad always said too,

37:22.774 --> 37:24.507
Is stick and stay
and make it pay.

37:24.509 --> 37:26.309
You would rather start
from square one again,

37:26.311 --> 37:29.546
Somewhere else
with no network,
no connections,

37:29.615 --> 37:31.815
No customers, no shipping.

37:31.817 --> 37:33.049
No place to stay.

37:34.319 --> 37:35.619
Hmm.

37:37.022 --> 37:38.388
How do you think
we ended up here?

37:41.827 --> 37:43.793
So, you guys gonna let me?

37:47.399 --> 37:49.299
I understand and I respect
one hundred percent

37:49.368 --> 37:50.867
What you want to do
for your father.

37:50.869 --> 37:53.303
But I have
a lot of people that I...

37:53.372 --> 37:55.005
That I need to make
proud as well,

37:55.007 --> 37:57.674
And they're here.

37:57.676 --> 38:01.378
I've never gone anywhere else
in the world because there's
been no reason to.

38:01.380 --> 38:03.113
I know
I can make it work here.

38:03.214 --> 38:05.081
I support you
one hundred percent,

38:05.083 --> 38:07.384
But I'm not going.

38:09.988 --> 38:11.187
You gonna stick around here,

38:11.189 --> 38:12.822
Or are you going to go back
with your brother?

38:16.194 --> 38:19.029
We believe in what phil
was trying to do.

38:19.031 --> 38:20.530
[casey] so?

38:20.532 --> 38:23.066
We're not going to stop
until we... We've done
everything

38:23.068 --> 38:25.101
We can to see this through.

38:30.409 --> 38:31.708
[casey] so where are you
going to head?

38:34.379 --> 38:36.613
We'll head back to seattle,
just kind of regroup,

38:36.615 --> 38:38.315
And there was
a lot of different locations,

38:38.317 --> 38:41.384
My dad had thoughts of so...

38:41.386 --> 38:44.487
If you find something
that looks like it may
pan out very well,

38:44.489 --> 38:45.821
Give me a call.

38:46.958 --> 38:48.758
<i> Really breaks my heart</i>
<i> to leave these guys behind,</i>

38:48.760 --> 38:53.330
But we definitely
need another location
if we're going to expand

38:53.332 --> 38:55.332
And fulfill
the old man's dream.

38:55.400 --> 38:58.401
And the one thing
about phil is he didn't stop
until he found

38:58.403 --> 39:00.904
What he was looking for,
till he achieved his goal.

39:00.906 --> 39:02.772
And we're going to do
the same thing.

39:02.774 --> 39:04.007
Indeed.

39:05.110 --> 39:06.409
[man 1] really?

39:09.548 --> 39:11.314
We need a new start.

39:13.819 --> 39:16.219
We're going to have
to go to plan b.

39:16.221 --> 39:18.421
<i> I need to get</i>
<i> the bad juju off of me.</i>

39:20.225 --> 39:24.461
I agree, and I'll just pack up
our stuff tonight and I'll...

39:27.132 --> 39:28.965
Kind of figure this out.

39:31.169 --> 39:32.702
Let's get rolling.

39:48.286 --> 39:49.819
[josh] right now,

39:49.888 --> 39:52.222
There's just a lot more
out there,

39:52.224 --> 39:53.623
I gotta find it.

39:57.896 --> 40:00.430
If he wants to go follow
his dad's footsteps

40:00.432 --> 40:02.665
And go out and flip over
a bunch more of stones,

40:02.667 --> 40:04.000
That's fine with me.

40:04.002 --> 40:09.005
It's just I have a [bleep]
ton of money invested
over here.

40:09.007 --> 40:14.010
I'm not going to walk away
from that and let it sit idle
to go explore.

40:14.012 --> 40:17.680
[josh] <i> I know jeff</i>
<i> and casey think</i>
<i> that this is probably crazy</i>

40:17.682 --> 40:20.316
<i> And knowing me,</i>
<i> it probably is crazy.</i>

40:20.418 --> 40:23.052
But sometimes you just
got to follow your gut,

40:23.054 --> 40:25.088
Even if you don't know
where it's going to take you.

40:27.192 --> 40:29.726
You know, I wish him the best,
and, you know,

40:29.795 --> 40:30.993
I don't think it's goodbye.

40:30.995 --> 40:34.564
It's just I've got a family
that I need to support.

40:34.633 --> 40:36.299
<i> I hope he figures out</i>
<i> what he's looking for.</i>

40:40.405 --> 40:41.805
For me and casey,

40:41.807 --> 40:45.909
Our priority is rebuilding
this market over here
in hawaii.

40:45.911 --> 40:47.210
[casey] where's josh at?

40:47.212 --> 40:49.879
With these names,
at this time,

40:49.881 --> 40:51.146
This would only make sense.

40:51.216 --> 40:53.216
Your dad was looking
at some fisheries down
in mexico.

40:53.218 --> 40:54.317
I'll give you a hand.

40:54.386 --> 40:57.120
[man 2] three, two, one!

40:57.122 --> 40:58.721
Start fishing!
Start fishing!

40:58.790 --> 41:00.824
Go, go, go, go!

41:00.826 --> 41:04.427
[overlapping conversation]

41:04.429 --> 41:06.896
-Whoo!
-[man 3] ah-ha!

41:06.898 --> 41:08.498
[jeff] beautiful fish.

41:08.500 --> 41:10.700
That's ahi baby.

41:10.769 --> 41:12.502
-[shane speaking]
-[jeff] yeah.

41:12.504 --> 41:14.170
That's not good.
We've got a big fish.

41:14.172 --> 41:15.905
I don't want this guy
chasing our fish.

41:15.907 --> 41:17.207
[shane] right here
under the boat.

41:17.308 --> 41:18.374
Whoa!

41:18.376 --> 41:20.677
I really don't want to fish
right now.

41:20.679 --> 41:23.713
I don't know, man, I got
some thinking to do.

41:23.815 --> 41:26.115
You're the man that built
that...
