00:04.537 --> 00:07.005
- Hey, Dad.
- Hello, Randy.

00:07.073 --> 00:10.941
Wow. Nomad's looking great.
Never seen it look this shiny.

00:11.011 --> 00:13.138
After hours of deliberation,

00:13.213 --> 00:16.580
I have selected this car
for you to take your driver's test in.

00:16.649 --> 00:20.210
Over the Mustang and the Austin Healey?
How'd they take it?

00:20.320 --> 00:22.481
Well, the Mustang took it OK.

00:22.589 --> 00:26.218
But the Austin Healey's
in a bit of a snit.

00:26.292 --> 00:29.352
I wanted to talk to you
about my driver's appointment.

00:29.429 --> 00:30.396
OK.

00:30.497 --> 00:32.192
I called to make an appointment.

00:32.265 --> 00:35.393
They were all booked up
on Saturday, so I made it for tomorrow.

00:35.468 --> 00:37.902
- I can't go tomorrow.
- Mom'll take me.

00:37.971 --> 00:42.465
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. There are
certain first times in a boy's life

00:42.542 --> 00:46.000
you don't want your mom with you,
and this is the main one. Um...

00:48.114 --> 00:50.776
- A week from Saturday.
- I don't wanna wait a week.

00:50.850 --> 00:53.512
- Wait a week for me.
- I'll have Brad take me.

00:53.586 --> 00:57.283
A father's supposed to be there
for the great moments in his sors life.

00:57.357 --> 01:00.690
Dad, you werert there when I was born.

01:00.760 --> 01:02.728
But this is big.

01:05.432 --> 01:09.562
- I know how important this is to you.
- No, this is really a big deal for me.

01:09.636 --> 01:12.935
- There's gonna be other occasions.
- What other occasions?

01:13.006 --> 01:17.170
First dead battery,
license renewals, tickets.

01:17.243 --> 01:21.179
- You'll be right by my side for 'em.
- You're not just saying this?

01:22.515 --> 01:25.279
- I promise.
- God bless you, son.

01:27.000 --> 01:33.074

02:15.802 --> 02:17.770
<i>Welcome back to Tool Time.</i>

02:17.871 --> 02:21.830
For those of you who just joined us,
where the hell have you been?

02:23.309 --> 02:27.405
We've shown you how to run wire through
a frame wall before the drywall is up.

02:27.480 --> 02:30.779
Next, we'll show you how to run wire
through an existing wall.

02:30.850 --> 02:34.013
Which can be tough.
You'll find yourself in a very spot.

02:34.087 --> 02:36.578
Which Tim is very good
at getting us into.

02:38.124 --> 02:42.584
Al is good at getting into tight spots.
You wedged yourself into those trousers.

02:46.166 --> 02:49.260
Sometimes, you know, conduit,
water pipes, insulation,

02:49.335 --> 02:51.803
can make it very difficult to run wire.

02:51.871 --> 02:54.203
- Tim, give me a hand here.
- All right.

02:57.644 --> 02:59.771
As you can see from this cutout wall,

02:59.846 --> 03:02.747
running wire through here
would be very difficult.

03:02.815 --> 03:06.581
<i>Not for our next guest. A warm Tool
Time welcome for master electrician,</i>

03:06.686 --> 03:07.812
Judy McHale.

03:10.557 --> 03:13.025
- Hi, Al.
- Hi, Judy.

03:13.092 --> 03:14.252
Tim.

03:14.360 --> 03:16.487
- Judy, welcome to the show.
- Thank you.

03:16.563 --> 03:19.794
You have a unique way of running wire
through tight spaces.

03:19.866 --> 03:22.198
That's right, Tim. I call it Judy's way.

03:22.268 --> 03:25.704
Well, fascinating.
Do you have a unique tool that you use?

03:25.772 --> 03:28.741
You betcha.
Right here in Judy's tool box.

03:29.943 --> 03:33.709
OK. Why don't you open it
with Judy's hand?

03:33.780 --> 03:34.940
OK.

03:37.450 --> 03:39.543
- It's a rat.
- Yeah.

03:39.619 --> 03:42.383
- What do you call this?
- I call it Judy's rat.

03:43.523 --> 03:47.186
A welcome addition to any toolbox.
Does he come in metric?

03:53.199 --> 03:56.965
Um, Judy, tell the audience
what you've trained that rat to do?

03:57.036 --> 03:59.800
I've taught him to run
all kinds of wire through walls,

03:59.906 --> 04:01.999
including computer wire for schools.

04:02.075 --> 04:06.341
So, you need that rat
before you can use your mouse.

04:09.782 --> 04:13.240
Judy takes her work very seriously.

04:13.319 --> 04:15.287
Judy needs a man.

04:18.124 --> 04:20.957
Judy heard that.

04:21.027 --> 04:22.995
It's true, though.

04:26.299 --> 04:30.759
I've taught this little fella how to run
wire through walls filled with asbestos.

04:35.174 --> 04:38.337
Well, that would explain the cough,
then, wouldn't it?

04:38.411 --> 04:41.574
Why don't we put the little electrician
through his paces, OK?

04:41.681 --> 04:44.377
Judy'll put the rat
in the opening up here.

04:44.450 --> 04:47.749
Tim is going to reward him
with a piece of cheese at the bottom.

04:47.820 --> 04:51.654
You can see by the complexity of this
wall, it'd be hard to do this by hand.

04:51.724 --> 04:54.056
When the rat comes down to the bottom,

04:54.127 --> 04:57.187
we'll have a little
wine and cheese party to celebrate.

04:58.131 --> 05:01.396
- There we go.
- All right.

05:01.467 --> 05:03.435
- What's next?
- We need the cheese.

05:03.536 --> 05:06.767
- Heidi?
- I left it on the work... bench.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.909
Sorry.

05:14.981 --> 05:18.712
- It won't work without cheese, Tim.
- I can motivate a rat. Watch this.

05:18.785 --> 05:20.309
We'll get him out.

05:21.988 --> 05:24.422
OK, come on. Go on down there.

05:24.490 --> 05:26.822
Put your hand down there.
Come on. Ratty.

05:26.893 --> 05:29.225
Come on!

05:29.295 --> 05:31.058
Meow! Meow!

05:31.130 --> 05:32.654
Psst! Psst!

05:34.967 --> 05:39.529
- What's the matter, Tim?
- Judy's rat bit Tim's nose.

05:39.605 --> 05:41.766
Judy has a confession to make.

05:41.874 --> 05:45.810
Judy's rat doesn't know how to wire
this wall because it's not Judy's rat.

05:45.878 --> 05:48.540
- What?
- And I'm not really Judy.

05:48.614 --> 05:51.640
- Well, who are you?
- I'm Judy's sister Trudy.

05:51.718 --> 05:53.686
I just wanted to meet Al.

05:56.189 --> 05:58.054
Hey, guys. What's up?

05:58.124 --> 06:02.891
Well, the bass player in Ronny's band
quit, so I'm taking his place.

06:02.995 --> 06:06.658
Hey, that's wonderful.
Well, except you don't know how to play.

06:07.767 --> 06:09.735
Didrt stop the last guy.

06:11.471 --> 06:13.530
Besides, Ronny's teaching me.

06:13.606 --> 06:16.541
- What do you play in the band?
- Ronny's our singer.

06:16.609 --> 06:17.940
Yeah.

06:19.746 --> 06:21.714
You know, that makes a lot of sense.

06:21.814 --> 06:25.341
Because normally you're kind of
a quiet and private person.

06:25.418 --> 06:27.511
And I'll bet that when you're on stage,

06:27.587 --> 06:31.455
that allows you to open up emotionally
and connect with the audience.

06:31.524 --> 06:33.014
No.

06:34.227 --> 06:35.785
Come on, Ronny. Let's play.

06:35.862 --> 06:36.829
Later.

06:40.133 --> 06:43.899
- Hi. What happened to you?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

06:43.970 --> 06:46.200
Randy's not back from his driver's test.

06:46.272 --> 06:49.537
- Yeah, and I've been thinking...
- Oh, no.

06:49.609 --> 06:53.340
I still think that we shouldn't let him
drive at night for a while.

06:53.413 --> 06:56.849
You take away his night-driving
privileges, that's humiliating.

06:56.916 --> 07:00.283
You might as well just put him
in a dress and give him a bus pass.

07:00.386 --> 07:03.753
Look, a lot of states have passed
nighttime driving laws

07:03.856 --> 07:06.620
because teenagers
have more accidents after dark.

07:06.692 --> 07:09.456
I've driven with him at night
and he's a good driver.

07:09.529 --> 07:13.488
I just want him to have more experience
before we send him out in the dark.

07:14.267 --> 07:17.896
You know, night isn't as dark
as it was when we first started driving.

07:19.272 --> 07:22.833
- What?!
- El NiÃ±o.

07:26.245 --> 07:30.739
He's gonna be just fine. And we can't
have different rules for different kids.

07:30.817 --> 07:34.776
- We let Brad drive his first night.
- Yeah, and he rear-ended somebody.

07:34.887 --> 07:37.515
- Could happen to anybody.
- Then he lied about it.

07:37.590 --> 07:40.923
- He was scared.
- Then the guy he hit tried to sue us.

07:40.993 --> 07:44.053
Our insurance rates went
through the roof and so did you.

07:44.130 --> 07:46.098
- Yeah, I did, didn't I?
- Yes.

07:48.701 --> 07:50.669
I got bit by a rat today.

07:53.139 --> 07:55.300
- Hey.
- What happened to you?

07:55.374 --> 07:58.537
Forget about it, Brad. It's Chinatown.

08:00.146 --> 08:03.115
- Well, what happened?
- Well, I got some bad news.

08:03.216 --> 08:06.083
Oh, God. You failed the test.

08:06.152 --> 08:09.815
The bad news is you have
another teenage driver to insure.

08:09.889 --> 08:13.052
- You! Congratulations! Yeah!
- Congratulations, honey.

08:13.125 --> 08:15.355
- All right!
- Yeah, I'm glad I took him.

08:15.428 --> 08:20.889
It brought back a lot of old great
memories from when I started driving.

08:20.967 --> 08:24.528
- I'm proud of you, kid.
- Thanks, Pops.

08:24.637 --> 08:27.333
This is great.
I can't believe I have my license.

08:27.406 --> 08:30.307
Randy, your father and I
wanna talk to you about that.

08:30.376 --> 08:34.539
I know, I know. Buckle up, drive slow,
and always yield to a classic car.

08:35.881 --> 08:39.010
- Uh, actually, there's more.
- Well, could you make it quick?

08:39.085 --> 08:42.384
I'm taking Lauren out for dinner
and a drive up to Grosse Pointe.

08:42.455 --> 08:43.785
That's great.

08:43.856 --> 08:47.758
What might be an even greater idea
is you drive up there during the day.

08:47.827 --> 08:50.557
You check it out,
so if you ever got there at night,

08:50.630 --> 08:52.894
you'd know
night would be a little darker,

08:52.965 --> 08:55.525
darkness would be different
than the day...

08:55.601 --> 08:57.569
What are you talking about?

08:57.670 --> 09:02.039
Your father is trying to say we're
uncomfortable with you driving at night.

09:02.141 --> 09:05.269
Don't worry. I'll be fine.
The car's got headlights, Mom.

09:05.344 --> 09:08.279
No, honey, honey,
you don't understand, you see...

09:08.347 --> 09:11.111
...we are so uncomfortable

09:11.183 --> 09:13.674
that in order
to alleviate our discomfort,

09:13.753 --> 09:16.017
we're not gonna let you do it.

09:17.757 --> 09:18.883
What?! Dad!

09:18.958 --> 09:22.121
I'm in total agreement on this.
It's just for a short time.

09:22.194 --> 09:24.526
- Yeah, a month.
- A month?!

09:26.632 --> 09:28.793
I thought we were thinking about a week.

09:28.868 --> 09:31.336
What we meant was a month.

09:31.404 --> 09:34.771
- This is totally unfair.
- Nighttime driving is trickier.

09:34.874 --> 09:37.638
We just want you to master
daytime driving first.

09:37.710 --> 09:40.338
Brad drove at night
as soon as he got his license.

09:40.413 --> 09:44.247
- And he had an accident, didn't he?
- I have to pay for Brad's screw-ups?

09:44.317 --> 09:48.048
Well, that's kind of
how the system works, you know.

09:48.120 --> 09:51.487
You pay for Brad's mistakes
and Mark'll pay for your mistakes.

09:51.591 --> 09:55.687
- What mistakes have I made?
- Well, having Brad as a brother.

09:57.496 --> 10:00.727
This makes no sense. How could you
let Mom talk you into this?

10:01.667 --> 10:03.635
I got bit by a rat today.

10:08.140 --> 10:09.471
Hello?

10:10.509 --> 10:12.272
Yeah. Just a second.

10:12.345 --> 10:14.313
Mark, it's for you.

10:17.283 --> 10:21.447
Another call for Mark. You know, this
band thing is making him really popular.

10:21.554 --> 10:24.921
- His calls have doubled.
- Yeah, that's two this month.

10:27.994 --> 10:29.825
Well, I'm back safe and sound

10:29.895 --> 10:33.854
before the danger of nightfall
rears its ugly little head.

10:33.933 --> 10:35.901
Did you and Lauren have a good time?

10:36.002 --> 10:39.165
We had another lovely
wonderful afternoon date.

10:39.238 --> 10:41.206
We caught a 3:30 matinÃ©e

10:41.307 --> 10:44.674
filled with old people
explaining the movie to each other.

10:45.978 --> 10:49.539
Then we went to an early-bird dinner
filled with old people saying,

10:49.649 --> 10:52.550
"Does the salmon have bones?
I hate bones."

10:55.321 --> 10:58.688
Hey, Mom. Our band got
a rehearsal studio for the night.

10:58.758 --> 11:02.421
- Can I go? I'll be back by 11.
- No, honey. It's a school night.

11:02.495 --> 11:05.987
- Oh, come on, Mom. Just this once?
- I don't know. I...

11:06.065 --> 11:10.024
Mom, think about it.
Mark playing somewhere that's not here.

11:12.038 --> 11:14.506
Well, your grades
have been really good lately.

11:14.573 --> 11:17.804
Get your stuff. I'll drop you off
on the way to the PTA meeting.

11:17.877 --> 11:18.969
Thanks, Mom.

11:19.045 --> 11:20.706
I don't believe this.

11:20.780 --> 11:24.011
You never would have let me go out
this late on a school night.

11:24.083 --> 11:28.520
You never had trouble making friends.
This thing has been really good for him.

11:28.587 --> 11:30.418
Wait. Let me get this straight.

11:30.489 --> 11:33.356
Mark gets fewer rules
because he's a dork.

11:35.161 --> 11:37.925
And I get more rules
because Brad's a dork?

11:40.533 --> 11:43.058
That's night-driving dork to you.

11:45.037 --> 11:47.870
- Mom, I'm ready.
- Honey, I gotta go to this meeting.

11:47.940 --> 11:51.000
When I get back,
we're gonna talk about this some more.

11:51.077 --> 11:54.103
- Bye-bye, guys.
- Bye.

11:54.180 --> 11:57.308
Does this seem completely unfair to you?

11:57.383 --> 12:01.410
Why would you want my opinion?
I'm just a dork.

12:01.487 --> 12:02.954
Good point.

12:05.458 --> 12:06.789
Where are you going?

12:06.859 --> 12:09.692
I don't know,
but I'm driving there in the dark.

12:12.264 --> 12:14.596
Mark's gonna pay for this.

12:25.878 --> 12:28.779
- We're back.
- How was the PTA meeting?

12:28.848 --> 12:33.785
Great. Me and the metal-shop teacher
heckled the principal the entire time.

12:33.853 --> 12:37.414
Yeah. God, I was so proud.
Where is Randy?

12:37.490 --> 12:39.981
I really don't know. Maybe he's in bed.

12:43.295 --> 12:47.994
- It's 9:15.
- Well, you know, he ate dinner at four.

12:48.067 --> 12:51.525
- You drank all the root beer.
- There's some more in the garage.

12:51.604 --> 12:54.698
- Actually, I'll get it, Dad.
- I'm closer. I'll get it.

12:54.774 --> 12:58.642
- Mom, where are you going?
- If he's awake, I wanna talk to him.

12:58.711 --> 13:01.805
- I don't think you should go down.
- Why not?

13:01.881 --> 13:04.941
If he's sleeping, it'll be dark and...

13:05.017 --> 13:07.713
...you could trip
and fall and wake him up.

13:09.622 --> 13:13.353
I found the root beer. Odd thing,
though. I couldn't find the Nomad.

13:13.425 --> 13:16.553
- Oh, no!
- It's not in the driveway.

13:16.629 --> 13:20.087
It's not in the garage.
Where is the station wagon, Brad?

13:20.166 --> 13:24.466
Well, it is called a Nomad.
Maybe it wandered off?

13:27.339 --> 13:30.866
Enough with the jokes.
Where's the Nomad?

13:30.943 --> 13:34.174
Randy took off with it
after you guys left. He was really mad.

13:34.246 --> 13:35.941
- Where'd he go?
- I don't know.

13:36.015 --> 13:38.643
Your brother's out
driving alone in the dark

13:38.717 --> 13:40.844
and all you can say is you don't know?!

13:40.920 --> 13:44.185
Well, I saved you some pizza.

13:45.291 --> 13:47.623
- Where do you think he went?
- I don't know.

13:47.693 --> 13:52.630
- But he'll be back in maybe a month.
- What's that supposed to mean?

13:52.698 --> 13:55.531
You punished him for something Brad did.

13:55.601 --> 13:57.831
I'm not punishing him.
Besides, we agreed.

13:57.903 --> 14:00.872
We agreed that he shouldn't
be driving at night for a while.

14:00.973 --> 14:03.134
You came up
with this 30-day month thing.

14:03.242 --> 14:05.210
I'm just trying to protect Randy.

14:05.311 --> 14:08.474
Same way you protected him
by letting Mark stay out till 11:00

14:08.547 --> 14:11.380
on a school night, something
you've never let Randy do.

14:11.450 --> 14:15.216
Well, I let Randy do other stuff.
I don't want to argue about this now.

14:15.287 --> 14:17.949
- I gotta go find him.
- He's gonna be fine.

14:18.023 --> 14:21.584
He's doing what you psychiatrists
call acting out.

14:21.694 --> 14:24.993
- Yeah. He's acting out.
- Out, up, in, over, between.

14:25.064 --> 14:29.933
It's just psychodribble. He just feels
like he's being treated unfairly.

14:30.002 --> 14:33.369
- That's the problem.
- He said something about Grosse Pointe.

14:33.439 --> 14:35.339
Maybe I should just drive up there.

14:35.407 --> 14:38.865
Yeah! Find him and his girlfriend
making out, rap on the window,

14:38.944 --> 14:42.107
"I'm just here
to protect my little baby."

14:43.048 --> 14:44.811
OK. You're right. Bad idea.

14:44.917 --> 14:47.681
We'll just wait here,
give him a chance to come home.

14:47.786 --> 14:50.118
A little bit of pizza...

14:51.657 --> 14:53.625
There's no cheese.

14:58.464 --> 15:00.796
Hey, Brad! Has Al been over here?

15:03.335 --> 15:05.098
I'm kind of worried about Randy.

15:05.204 --> 15:08.367
After you pick up Mark,
will you drive around and look for him?

15:08.474 --> 15:10.965
Sure. Drive around a city
of six million going,

15:11.043 --> 15:14.809
"Randy! Randy! Randy!"

15:15.881 --> 15:17.849
Tim, take the cell phone with you.

15:17.950 --> 15:20.919
If you see him, call me.
If he comes home, I'll call you.

15:20.986 --> 15:23.216
- What's my number?
- It's your phone.

15:23.289 --> 15:25.655
- I never call myself.
- I never call you.

15:25.724 --> 15:28.955
- Why do we have this thing?
- I don't know. Just go.

15:29.028 --> 15:31.553
Randy! Randy!

15:32.965 --> 15:38.335
Hi, Wilson. What are you doing?

15:38.437 --> 15:40.735
I just came from a Cinco de Mayo party.

15:40.806 --> 15:44.765
<i>Might I serenade you
with a chorus of Cielito Lindo?</i>

15:44.877 --> 15:47.209
Some other time.
I'm worried about Randy.

15:47.279 --> 15:50.248
- Randito?
- He took off with one of our cars.

15:50.316 --> 15:54.082
Ooh! Randito bandito.

15:54.153 --> 15:56.519
Are you drunk?

16:00.359 --> 16:04.022
Randy's mad. I won't let him drive
at night the way I let his brother.

16:04.096 --> 16:08.931
- Was that because of Brad's accident?
- Yeah. Tim thinks I've been unfair.

16:09.001 --> 16:11.868
- I think he's right.
- Well, why is that?

16:11.937 --> 16:14.565
I make different rules
for different kids.

16:14.640 --> 16:18.098
I let Mark stay out late, which I never
would let the other guys do.

16:18.177 --> 16:20.941
- Right.
- I'm an inconsistent parent.

16:21.046 --> 16:24.072
Well...

16:30.289 --> 16:34.157
All employees must wash their hands
before returning to work?

16:37.162 --> 16:40.723
All right, maybe I had one margarita.

16:41.567 --> 16:45.298
But I do have something to say
about you being an inconsistent parent.

16:45.371 --> 16:49.535
- What's that?
- The essayist Ralph Waldo Emerson said,

16:49.608 --> 16:54.636
"A foolish consistency
is the hobgoblin of little minds."

16:54.713 --> 16:58.376
You know, Randy and Brad and Mark,
they're totally different kids.

16:58.450 --> 17:00.884
To give them one set of rules
would be folly.

17:00.953 --> 17:04.616
So you're saying that I was right
not to let Randy drive at night?

17:04.690 --> 17:07.181
No, I'm just saying
you should treat each child

17:07.259 --> 17:09.386
according to his individual needs.

17:09.461 --> 17:13.227
Maybe Randy didn't need for me
to be overprotective of him driving.

17:13.298 --> 17:15.561
I've driven with him.
He's a great driver.

17:18.804 --> 17:24.299
So when he comes home, I guess
I'll, you know, tell him I'm sorry.

17:24.376 --> 17:27.709
Wilson, can I give you some advice?

17:27.780 --> 17:28.747
<i>SÃ­</i>

17:28.847 --> 17:32.408
Lose the Spanish accent
but keep those toreador pants.

17:36.021 --> 17:39.320
Brad, how can you eat
such a huge sandwich so late at night?

17:39.391 --> 17:41.882
Well, Randy's gone. I'm eating for two.

17:44.997 --> 17:47.898
- I'm back. Let me have it.
- Randy, where have you been?

17:47.966 --> 17:52.994
I was just driving around. I realize
it was stupid for me to take the car.

17:53.072 --> 17:55.404
But I felt if I was being punished,

17:55.474 --> 17:57.942
I might as well do something
to deserve it.

17:58.010 --> 18:00.706
Oh, God. I have been a nervous wreck.

18:00.779 --> 18:03.942
I'm sorry, Mom. I just thought
that I was getting a raw deal.

18:04.016 --> 18:07.577
Well, you were.
I know you're a good driver.

18:07.653 --> 18:11.521
I shouldn't have let Brad's accident
affect the way that I treated you.

18:11.590 --> 18:15.082
- I was wrong.
- Wait. Let me get this straight.

18:15.160 --> 18:17.924
Did you just say you were wrong?

18:17.996 --> 18:23.059
- Sometimes parents make mistakes.
- Yeah, but they never admit it.

18:23.135 --> 18:25.899
I mean, this is huge.

18:25.971 --> 18:28.531
Yeah, especially since
you stole our car.

18:28.607 --> 18:32.475
Well, since this is your first offense,
I'll let you off with a warning,

18:32.544 --> 18:35.308
and I hope you do the same for me.

18:35.414 --> 18:38.042
Hope again.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.847
Would you stop playing that thing?!

18:40.919 --> 18:45.686
All the way in the car. Ding-ding-ding.
You're driving me crazy. Stop it.

18:45.791 --> 18:49.522
Oh, look who's back.
Mr. Grand Theft Auto.

18:52.231 --> 18:54.290
I wouldn't wanna be you right now.

18:54.366 --> 18:57.392
I wouldn't wanna be you ever.

18:57.469 --> 19:01.599
Mom, there's been a shake-up
in the band. I'm now lead tambourine.

19:01.673 --> 19:03.106
Oh.

19:03.175 --> 19:07.339
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man,
play your song somewhere else.

19:09.815 --> 19:14.377
You take the car, it's like stealing it.
She was worried. I need an explanation.

19:14.486 --> 19:16.716
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry doesn't cut it.

19:16.788 --> 19:20.519
- I went overboard and you were right.
- Yeah, well, I'm telling you...

19:22.961 --> 19:26.920
- She said I was right?
- She didn't use your name specifically.

19:26.999 --> 19:30.298
That doesn't matter. This is huge.

19:31.303 --> 19:34.830
Can we talk about the punishment
he's gonna get for taking the car?

19:34.907 --> 19:37.068
Thank God he's back.
The car is all right?

19:37.142 --> 19:40.805
It's fine, although it was pulling
to the left, so I put air in the tires.

19:40.879 --> 19:43.177
- Did you get the good air?
- Yeah. Dad, I...

19:43.248 --> 19:46.547
I went to Smitty's.
Hose across from pump number four.

19:46.618 --> 19:49.314
- Talk to Smitty?
- He's having marital problems.

19:49.388 --> 19:52.755
- His wife and him never get along.
- I know. I can't believe that.

19:52.858 --> 19:55.759
Guys, can we get back
to the punishment thing?

19:57.162 --> 19:59.426
You did take the car
when we told you not to.

19:59.498 --> 20:01.932
I say a week without any driving at all.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.959
One week? I couldn't drive for a month
after I got in my accident.

20:06.071 --> 20:08.596
- Completely different situation.
- Not to me.

20:08.674 --> 20:11.336
How can you give him
less punishment than me?

20:11.410 --> 20:16.541
We have to treat each one of you
differently according to your needs.

20:19.518 --> 20:21.486
And who decides what our needs are?

20:21.587 --> 20:23.020
We do.

20:24.623 --> 20:27.717
- Right, Tim?
- Huh?

20:28.327 --> 20:29.988
Tim, how come every time

20:30.062 --> 20:33.225
I try to have an important parenting
discussion, you tune out?

20:34.666 --> 20:37.191
I got bit by a rat this morning.

20:41.740 --> 20:45.176
What do you think of Mark's band?

20:45.244 --> 20:48.213
Sounds like they're playing
my bench grinder.

20:49.314 --> 20:53.080
I wanna make sure they're not fiddling
with my stuff out there.

21:02.794 --> 21:07.493
He's good. We can send him to Europe
to study with the Gypsies.

21:12.304 --> 21:15.637
<i>* Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

21:15.707 --> 21:20.440
<i>- Take it, Mark.
- * Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!</i>

21:20.512 --> 21:24.039
<i>* Yeah, yeah, yeah!</i>

21:24.116 --> 21:25.777
<i>* Yeah *</i>

21:27.219 --> 21:29.346
Wow, that was great, guys. Great.

21:29.421 --> 21:32.049
- Really great.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:33.692 --> 21:35.250
What do you call that?

21:35.894 --> 21:37.555
<i>The Happy Clown.</i>

21:45.804 --> 21:48.295
You're a very strange little man, Ronny.

21:52.110 --> 21:53.270
Where are you going?

21:53.345 --> 21:55.905
I don't know,
but I'm driving there in the dark.

22:02.421 --> 22:05.254
Why don't we look
at our pint-size electrician in...

22:08.427 --> 22:13.296
All sorts of things back here,
like asbestos and and, uh...
