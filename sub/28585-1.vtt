Oh.

00:27.592 --> 00:29.058
Lots of love letters.

00:31.159 --> 00:32.790
Wow.

00:39.592 --> 00:41.157
- What is that?
- It's a camera.

00:46.994 --> 00:49.061
Look. Your mom.

00:50.759 --> 00:52.557
I've never seen that one before.

00:52.559 --> 00:54.624
Looks like
just before she died.

00:54.626 --> 00:56.292
Maybe it's from the camera.

00:56.294 --> 00:58.594
- Where'd she get it?
- City auction.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.560
Ah, cool.

01:01.592 --> 01:02.857
She liked that kind of stuff.

01:05.626 --> 01:08.259
Um, Craig just liked my picture.

01:10.592 --> 01:13.524
Sorry, I told you to take one
of your own.

01:13.526 --> 01:14.991
It's only lingerie, Sarah.

01:14.993 --> 01:16.594
You show more on the beach.

01:17.727 --> 01:19.928
Well then, let's take one.

01:20.994 --> 01:22.060
For real?

01:23.193 --> 01:24.992
But I want it to be special.

01:24.994 --> 01:27.757
One of a kind. Something
only he'll have a copy of.

01:27.759 --> 01:29.860
Okay. What have you got in mind?

01:30.559 --> 01:32.494
We take it...

01:32.926 --> 01:34.060
with this.

01:38.527 --> 01:39.761
Are you ready?

02:02.093 --> 02:03.258
Is it broken?

02:03.260 --> 02:04.857
No, it just takes a while.

02:04.859 --> 02:05.861
Mm.

02:29.893 --> 02:31.460
Uh, I gotta jet.

02:33.927 --> 02:35.827
- You look good.
- Thanks.

02:52.827 --> 02:53.894

04:02.592 --> 04:03.960
Is anybody there?

04:38.126 --> 04:39.593
Hello?

05:12.259 --> 05:13.693
Linda?

05:14.993 --> 05:16.593
This isn't funny.

07:07.560 --> 07:08.992
Chin down a little. Smile.

07:19.226 --> 07:20.524
Hey.

07:20.526 --> 07:21.957
Name?

07:21.959 --> 07:24.724
Um, Bird. Bird Fitcher.

07:24.726 --> 07:26.190
You wanna take that off?

07:26.192 --> 07:28.056
Look, it's Scarf Girl.

07:30.193 --> 07:31.591
Um, no.

07:31.593 --> 07:34.627
No, I'm gonna, um,
keep it on, thanks.

07:35.193 --> 07:36.724

09:07.992 --> 09:10.590
And 'cause my uncle

09:10.592 --> 09:12.594

- You fix that yet?

09:13.193 --> 09:15.525
No, not yet.

09:15.527 --> 09:16.990
Well, anyway,
thanks for covering for me.

09:16.992 --> 09:18.557

Oh, my god.

09:33.226 --> 09:35.027
It's an SX-70.

09:37.159 --> 09:38.661
Holy shit.

09:41.992 --> 09:43.624
You like it?

09:43.626 --> 09:46.191
Tyler, where did you find this?

09:46.193 --> 09:49.223
Seriously, I've never seen one
of these before in real life.

09:49.225 --> 09:50.424
They don't even
make them anymore.

09:50.426 --> 09:54.056
They made them for, like,
a couple of years in the '70s.

09:54.058 --> 09:55.290
- Wow.
- This is the same camera

09:55.292 --> 09:57.557
Ansel Adams
and Walker Evans used.

09:57.559 --> 09:59.757
Whoa! They're...

09:59.759 --> 10:01.157
Photographers.

10:01.159 --> 10:03.257
Right. Oh, yeah, and...

10:03.259 --> 10:04.192
Anyway, it comes with the film,

10:04.194 --> 10:08.056
and there is a camera case
for it as well.

10:08.058 --> 10:09.824
This is so cool.

10:09.826 --> 10:11.860
If you wanna make sure it works,
there's still a photo in it.

10:12.192 --> 10:13.590
Oh, yeah.

10:13.592 --> 10:14.957
Want me to take your picture?

10:14.959 --> 10:16.023
No, thank you.

10:16.025 --> 10:17.960
Once was quite enough for today.

10:18.892 --> 10:21.590
Well, you can try it out
on me, then.

10:21.592 --> 10:22.525
- Okay. Yeah.
- All right.

10:22.527 --> 10:24.461
- Stand against that thing.
- Cool.

10:25.059 --> 10:26.891

10:57.192 --> 10:58.726

10:59.260 --> 11:00.891
No, no. You know what?

11:00.893 --> 11:03.761
No, it's fine, I...
I gotta get going anyway.

11:06.026 --> 11:09.657

13:48.626 --> 13:50.826
Look. It's just a camera.

13:56.860 --> 13:58.291
Hey, boy,

Hey, Ned. Ned.

14:23.192 --> 14:25.690

out of the house tonight?

14:25.692 --> 14:27.957

14:37.959 --> 14:39.594
So, how's your mom?

14:41.625 --> 14:43.957
She's still not talking to me.

14:43.959 --> 14:45.560
So that's awesome.

14:45.859 --> 14:47.823
Really?

14:47.825 --> 14:50.524
Yeah, she told my brother
she's praying on it,

14:50.526 --> 14:53.091
like that's gonna fix me.

14:53.093 --> 14:54.724
Oh, I'm sorry. That sucks.

Hey, at least
on the bright side,

14:56.226 --> 14:58.091

until college.

14:59.826 --> 15:01.891
Yeah.

15:01.893 --> 15:05.524
- You still going away for it?
- Yeah. Definitely.

15:05.526 --> 15:06.623
Have you changed your mind?

15:06.625 --> 15:09.859
Nope. Still doing Journalism
at county like my dad.

15:13.193 --> 15:14.824
So...

15:14.826 --> 15:16.859
Are you coming
to the party tonight or what?

15:17.758 --> 15:19.623
I don't know.

15:19.625 --> 15:21.290
Come on, it's a weeknight.

15:21.292 --> 15:23.024
And isn't it a costume thing?

15:23.026 --> 15:24.157

15:53.725 --> 15:54.823
Maybe?

15:54.825 --> 15:56.856
See, but that's why
you should come tonight.

anything to wear.

16:00.060 --> 16:02.659

- Oh, come on.

16:09.192 --> 16:10.724
Isn't she kind of lame?

16:10.726 --> 16:12.589
She gets catfished by a wolf,

16:12.591 --> 16:14.257
and has to be saved
by a woodcutter.

16:14.259 --> 16:15.624

21:20.758 --> 21:21.924
Avery.

21:21.926 --> 21:23.289
Meens.

21:23.291 --> 21:24.891
Hi.

21:24.893 --> 21:26.660
You guys look great.

21:29.025 --> 21:30.991
Um, everybody, get in.

21:30.993 --> 21:32.289
Pics or it didn't happen.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.124
- My gosh. Okay.
- Okay.

21:35.726 --> 21:37.290
Hey, girl,
what are you dressed as?

21:37.292 --> 21:38.860
A sexy fortune-teller.

21:39.192 --> 21:40.656
Come on.

21:40.658 --> 21:41.725
Oh.

21:42.059 --> 21:43.723
Move.

21:43.725 --> 21:46.857
Everyone who comes in,
gets a card.

21:46.859 --> 21:49.223
For you two, The Lovers.

21:49.225 --> 21:51.090
- Oh.
- Aw.

21:51.092 --> 21:53.492
Kasey, you get this one.

21:55.159 --> 21:56.256
The Fool?

21:56.258 --> 21:58.123
It's perfect, right?

21:58.125 --> 21:59.156
Yeah.

21:59.158 --> 22:01.592
And you, just pick one.

22:04.258 --> 22:05.625
Yeah.

22:08.859 --> 22:11.856
- Yeah, that's not good.
- Can I try again?

22:11.858 --> 22:13.289
Not really how it works.

22:13.291 --> 22:14.657
Hey, Becky J!

22:14.659 --> 22:15.860
Hey, girl.

22:19.926 --> 22:21.257
Oh, my god.

22:21.259 --> 22:23.756
Stop obsessing
and just get a drink.

22:23.758 --> 22:25.189
I'm not really in the mood.

22:25.191 --> 22:28.523
Whatever. Just promise me
you're not gonna hang out alone

22:28.525 --> 22:30.257
in a dark corner like a weirdo.

22:30.259 --> 22:31.656
Of course not.

22:51.126 --> 22:52.726
Oh, my god.

23:05.659 --> 23:07.991
<i>♪ I feel the love, yeah ♪</i>

23:07.993 --> 23:10.692
<i>♪ I feel alive ♪</i>

23:14.191 --> 23:16.257
<i>♪ I feel the heat, yeah ♪</i>

23:16.259 --> 23:18.856
<i>♪ I feel the fire ♪</i>

23:18.858 --> 23:19.859
Hey.

23:23.558 --> 23:25.692
So, how'd the photo turn out?

23:26.591 --> 23:28.656
- What?
- That was you, right?

23:28.658 --> 23:30.257
The one behind the camera,

23:30.259 --> 23:31.689
- taking my picture.
- Oh.

23:31.691 --> 23:34.122
Oh, no, I wasn't taking
your picture.

23:34.124 --> 23:37.690
I was just doing this, like,
uh, camera test thing.

23:37.692 --> 23:39.524
Oh, so you weren't
taking a picture?

23:39.526 --> 23:42.590
No, no. That would be weird.

23:42.592 --> 23:43.993
Yeah. A little bit.

23:47.526 --> 23:49.060
Hey, come on.
Take a seat.

23:52.926 --> 23:53.991
I'm Connor.

23:53.993 --> 23:55.589
I know.

23:55.591 --> 23:57.289
I mean, hi. I'm Bird.

23:57.291 --> 23:58.923
- Bird?
- Mm-hm.

23:58.925 --> 24:00.290
Nice name, Bird.

24:00.292 --> 24:02.024
Oh, thanks.

24:02.026 --> 24:03.557
Dad gets all the credit.

24:03.559 --> 24:05.089
Thought I looked like
a little Cornish game hen

24:05.091 --> 24:06.559
when I was born.

24:07.992 --> 24:09.891
What's that?

24:09.893 --> 24:12.189
- Oh, this?
- Mm-hm.

24:12.191 --> 24:16.123
- It's... It's called an SX-70.
- Whoa.

24:16.125 --> 24:17.257
It's a camera?

24:17.259 --> 24:19.556
Yeah, it's a little old.

24:19.558 --> 24:21.556
Oh, I'm not used
to seeing people

24:21.558 --> 24:23.156
carrying these things around.

24:23.158 --> 24:24.592
Where'd you get it?

24:25.091 --> 24:26.155
I...

24:26.157 --> 24:28.122
I work at this antique store.

24:28.124 --> 24:30.290
Really? Wow.

24:30.292 --> 24:32.523
Didn't know anyone
under 80 did that.

24:32.525 --> 24:33.991
Yeah, well...

24:33.993 --> 24:36.723
I'm actually 82.
I just look amazing for my age.

24:37.858 --> 24:39.790
There's something
kinda cool about it.

24:39.792 --> 24:40.724
Mm-hm.

24:40.726 --> 24:43.056
Like, you're the only person
in the world

24:43.058 --> 24:44.560
who gets to have those images.

24:48.526 --> 24:49.590
Hey!

24:49.592 --> 24:52.257
Oh, what is going on over here?

24:52.259 --> 24:53.589
You guys know what tonight is?

24:53.591 --> 24:54.891
- No.
- Do you?

24:54.893 --> 24:57.590
Tonight, marks
my one-year anniversary

24:57.592 --> 24:58.857
with this lovely lady.

24:58.859 --> 25:01.256
- Oh.
- Mmm.

25:01.258 --> 25:02.290
- Group photo. Come on.
- Yes.

25:02.292 --> 25:03.856
- Get in here.
- Yes, yes.

25:03.858 --> 25:04.725
Here you go.

25:07.991 --> 25:09.724
Come on, Red Riding Hood.
Don't be shy.

25:10.592 --> 25:11.857
- Wait, no, you have to...
- Here?

25:11.859 --> 25:13.089
- You're framing it weird.
- Here?

25:13.091 --> 25:14.156
- No, like, down.
- There.

25:14.158 --> 25:16.189
- This way?
- Babe, weird angle. No.

25:16.191 --> 25:17.290
Third wheeling it over here.

25:17.292 --> 25:18.556
No, no, no, not...

25:18.558 --> 25:19.924
- Wait, guys.
- No.

25:19.926 --> 25:21.257
I can take it.

25:21.259 --> 25:22.593
With this.

25:24.725 --> 25:26.590
Um, someone shops
at Urban Outfitters.

25:26.592 --> 25:27.823
There you go.

25:27.825 --> 25:29.724
Thanks.

25:29.726 --> 25:31.089
- Okay.
- Wait, don't you wanna

25:31.091 --> 25:32.789
get in it with us?

25:32.791 --> 25:33.690
Oh, no.

25:33.692 --> 25:35.891
I'm, uh, much better
behind the camera.

25:35.893 --> 25:37.122
Okay.

25:37.124 --> 25:38.623
- All right, howl on five. Ready?
- Okay.

25:38.625 --> 25:41.289
Five, four, three, two...

25:41.291 --> 25:42.624
- Photobomb!
- ...one.

26:03.125 --> 26:05.023
It's pretty good.

26:05.025 --> 26:07.590
Except for Kasey's big ass head
in the foreground.

26:07.592 --> 26:09.790
Shut up.

26:09.792 --> 26:11.089
Is that
what I look like?

26:11.091 --> 26:12.190
- Yeah.
- Pretty much.

26:12.192 --> 26:13.257
Yeah, pretty much.

26:13.259 --> 26:14.289
I'm gonna get another drink.

26:14.291 --> 26:15.724
- Let's do that.
- Let's go.

26:15.726 --> 26:18.156
You guys have fun together.

26:18.158 --> 26:20.257
We're alike.

26:20.259 --> 26:23.593
Hey, you should... you should
jump in the next one with us.

26:30.525 --> 26:32.989
So you guys taking
a photo without me?

26:32.991 --> 26:34.623
Oh, hey, Avery.

26:34.625 --> 26:35.756
How does this thing
even work?

26:35.758 --> 26:37.557
It's like a tiny ass accordion.

26:37.559 --> 26:39.289
Oh, yeah. There's like
a little red button

26:39.291 --> 26:41.460
you have to press.

26:44.726 --> 26:45.858
It's blank.

26:45.860 --> 26:48.289
Yeah, well, it takes a minute
for the film to develop.

26:48.291 --> 26:49.723
Oh, shit!
It's the police!

26:51.259 --> 26:53.026
You gotta be kidding me.

26:58.125 --> 27:00.824
Bird, get down here!

27:22.124 --> 27:24.256
I'm Sheriff Pembroke.

27:24.258 --> 27:25.823
Why am I here? Is my mom okay?

27:25.825 --> 27:27.725
No, your mom's fine.
She's on her way.

27:28.725 --> 27:30.659
Okay, well then,
what's going on?

27:31.625 --> 27:32.889
You worked with Tyler Drew

27:32.891 --> 27:35.525
at the antique shop
on Darby Street, right?

27:36.692 --> 27:38.723
Yeah, I work with him. Why?

27:38.725 --> 27:41.156
When's the
last time you saw him?

27:41.158 --> 27:43.626
Around six,
when I left the store.

27:45.725 --> 27:47.858
I'm sorry to have
to tell you this, but, uh...

27:49.791 --> 27:51.058
Tyler's dead.

27:53.758 --> 27:54.859
What?

27:57.626 --> 28:00.023
No, I was... I was just
with him. He was fine.

28:00.025 --> 28:01.623
Was he
having any problems with anyone?

28:01.625 --> 28:03.459
Anybody who might
wanna hurt him?

28:05.858 --> 28:06.925
No.

28:08.092 --> 28:09.590
No, was that what happened?

28:09.592 --> 28:11.059
What about the last time
you saw him?

28:12.225 --> 28:15.858
Did he seem... nervous?
Agitated?

28:17.591 --> 28:19.559
No, he seemed normal.

28:21.858 --> 28:22.926
Okay.

28:25.259 --> 28:26.959
If you remember anything...

28:28.857 --> 28:30.026
give me a call.

28:37.192 --> 28:38.593
Fitcher.

28:41.124 --> 28:42.891
You're Doug Fitcher's daughter?

28:44.992 --> 28:46.959
Um... yeah.

28:50.124 --> 28:52.592
I was at the scene
the night of the accident.

28:56.825 --> 28:59.459
You are a very brave girl.

29:06.259 --> 29:07.823
Birdie.

29:07.825 --> 29:09.955
Hey, it's freezing
out here, honey.

29:09.957 --> 29:11.958
- Thank you.
- You're gonna catch a cold.

29:13.157 --> 29:15.123
Oh.

29:16.192 --> 29:17.859
Do you wanna talk about it?

29:18.757 --> 29:19.758
No.

29:20.957 --> 29:22.659
Maybe... I don't know.

29:24.591 --> 29:26.122
It just doesn't seem fair.

29:27.225 --> 29:30.223
I know. I know.

29:32.024 --> 29:34.492
Why would someone do this?

30:51.857 --> 30:53.524
<i>Party's over.</i>

30:53.526 --> 30:55.755
Love you all,
but get the hell out.

30:55.757 --> 30:56.859
Go. Go.

31:17.224 --> 31:18.523
Animals.

33:07.892 --> 33:08.992
Hello.

33:10.658 --> 33:11.859
Hello?

34:29.591 --> 34:31.991
Are you sure you wanna go
to school today?

34:34.125 --> 34:35.822
I could stay home with you.

34:35.824 --> 34:37.255
No. No, it's fine.

34:37.257 --> 34:39.524
Okay. Well, you think about it,
all right?

34:48.123 --> 34:49.688
Hey, Kasey, what's up?

34:49.690 --> 34:51.788
<i>Yo, you're never
gonna believe this.</i>

34:51.790 --> 34:54.588
<i>Avery fell down
her basement stairs.</i>

34:54.590 --> 34:55.855
<i>She's dead.</i>

34:55.857 --> 34:57.189
What?

34:57.191 --> 34:59.223
<i>And they think
it was an accident.</i>

34:59.225 --> 35:01.889
<i>I mean,
how does this just happen?</i>

35:01.891 --> 35:03.058
I'll call you back.

36:18.558 --> 36:19.792
Bird.

36:20.857 --> 36:22.222
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:22.224 --> 36:24.189
Yo, this shit is crazy.

36:24.191 --> 36:25.289
I heard her parents came home

36:25.291 --> 36:27.222
and found her at the bottom
of the basement steps,

36:27.224 --> 36:29.122
like head completely
turned around,

36:29.124 --> 36:30.891
full-on <i>Exorcist style.</i>

36:33.958 --> 36:34.992
What?

36:45.025 --> 36:46.889
How is this even possible?

36:46.891 --> 36:48.958
I mean, two people we know
in one day?

36:50.724 --> 36:53.155
It doesn't make any sense.

36:53.157 --> 36:54.622
I mean, Avery wasn't even
that drunk.

36:54.624 --> 36:56.556
How would she fall like that?

36:56.558 --> 36:57.892
What if she didn't?

36:58.790 --> 37:00.591
What if something happened
to her?

37:03.858 --> 37:04.891
Look.

37:06.858 --> 37:09.792
See that thing
in the group photo?

37:11.124 --> 37:12.555
The smudge?

37:12.557 --> 37:13.722
It's not a smudge.
This exact same...

37:13.724 --> 37:15.558
It looks like a smudge to me.

37:16.591 --> 37:17.792
Guys.

37:25.558 --> 37:28.622
This shadow,
I saw the exact one last night,

37:28.624 --> 37:31.588
before the party,
in Tyler's photo.

37:31.590 --> 37:33.755
What are you talking about?

37:33.757 --> 37:35.658
I took a photo of him.

37:36.524 --> 37:38.155
With this.

37:38.157 --> 37:39.622
Right before he died.

37:39.624 --> 37:41.856
And that shadow
was in the picture?

37:41.858 --> 37:42.922
Wait. What?

37:42.924 --> 37:44.055
I don't see a shadow.

37:44.057 --> 37:45.522
No, that's exactly my point.

37:45.524 --> 37:46.588
After Tyler died,

37:46.590 --> 37:48.223
the shadow moved
to Avery's photo.

37:48.225 --> 37:50.758
And then when Avery died,
it moved again.

37:52.825 --> 37:55.022
I... I think
you're all in danger.

37:55.024 --> 37:55.990
Come on, Bird.

37:55.992 --> 37:58.288
You should submit that shit
to Creepypasta.

38:02.257 --> 38:04.858
I think if it takes your photo,
you die.

38:06.758 --> 38:10.689
- Huh?
- First, Tyler. Now, Avery?

38:10.691 --> 38:12.555
That means next
is one of you.

38:12.557 --> 38:14.689
I don't know, maybe all of you.

38:14.691 --> 38:16.122
It's not even a very good photo.

38:16.124 --> 38:18.688
It's not a magic camera, Bird.

38:18.690 --> 38:19.856
I mean, if it really
freaks you out,

38:19.858 --> 38:21.256
we can get rid
of the damn thing.

38:21.258 --> 38:22.688
- Devin.
- Wait, don't.

38:22.690 --> 38:24.491
- Devin.
- Stupid photo.

38:25.591 --> 38:27.592
Problem solved.

38:40.757 --> 38:42.858
Guys.

38:44.858 --> 38:45.859
Whoa.

38:48.258 --> 38:49.556
What the...

38:53.257 --> 38:55.458
Oh, my god, I'm burning!

39:09.091 --> 39:10.823
- It's not working!
- Keep going!

39:10.825 --> 39:12.658
It's...
It's not working!

39:13.157 --> 39:14.556
Help me!

39:24.125 --> 39:25.926
Holy shit!

39:44.191 --> 39:45.792
This is so messed up.

39:46.925 --> 39:48.723
I mean, how are we linked
to a picture?

39:48.725 --> 39:51.056
- How is it even possible?
- I don't know.

39:51.058 --> 39:52.288
What do you mean you don't know?

39:52.290 --> 39:53.555
This is your camera.

39:53.557 --> 39:57.288
Yeah, it's not like this is in
the instruction manual, Devin.

39:57.290 --> 39:59.556
Let me see this thing.

39:59.558 --> 40:01.589
- Wait.
- No, no, no. No one touches it

40:01.591 --> 40:02.856
until we figure out
what's going on.

40:02.858 --> 40:03.889
All right.

40:03.891 --> 40:04.756
Excuse me.

40:04.758 --> 40:06.221
Your girlfriend's out
of surgery now,

40:06.223 --> 40:07.856
- if you'd like to see her.
- Yeah.

40:07.858 --> 40:09.523
And, miss, don't go far.

40:09.525 --> 40:11.022
Someone's gonna come here
for you in a few,

40:11.024 --> 40:12.458
take a look at that scalp.

40:14.024 --> 40:15.723
Figure this out, Bird.

40:15.725 --> 40:16.825
Fix it.

40:23.123 --> 40:25.055
Where did you even get this?

40:25.057 --> 40:26.154
I don't know.

40:26.156 --> 40:28.154
Tyler brought it in yesterday
from some yard sale.

40:28.156 --> 40:29.789
Did it come in like a box
or anything?

40:29.791 --> 40:32.221
Nope, just the film
and the case.

40:32.223 --> 40:33.858
Well, where's the case?

40:48.258 --> 40:50.522
Are you sure you wanna do this?

40:50.524 --> 40:52.556
I mean, if you want, I can go.

40:52.558 --> 40:53.522
No, it's okay.

40:53.524 --> 40:54.456
You're in the photo,
you should stay here.

40:54.458 --> 40:56.791
Yeah, but who says the car
is any safer?

40:57.758 --> 40:59.889
Well, look, if the police come,

40:59.891 --> 41:02.089
it's better
that you're not in there.

41:02.091 --> 41:03.592
Okay? Just...

41:04.725 --> 41:06.288
Call me if you see
anything weird, all right?

41:06.290 --> 41:07.992
Oh, we're way past weird.

41:10.123 --> 41:11.588
Hey.

41:11.590 --> 41:13.856
Even though you're not
in the photo,

41:13.858 --> 41:15.024
be careful.

42:17.190 --> 42:19.491
Oh, my god. Tyler.

43:42.024 --> 43:43.525
Ah!

44:03.991 --> 44:05.591
I got you. Come on.

44:06.290 --> 44:08.121
Run!

44:08.123 --> 44:09.788
Okay, come on,
let's go!

44:09.790 --> 44:11.424
- Get in the car.
- Hurry!

44:18.057 --> 44:19.559
Are you okay?

44:20.725 --> 44:22.592
Connor, there was something
in there.

44:23.857 --> 44:25.256
What?

44:25.258 --> 44:26.857
I don't know.

44:28.590 --> 44:30.558
Why is it coming
after me?

44:32.057 --> 44:34.189
Because you're in it.

44:34.191 --> 44:36.725
- What?
- Look in the reflection.

44:40.123 --> 44:41.559
You're in it.

45:00.990 --> 45:02.058
Hey.

45:04.657 --> 45:06.255
I talked to your parents.

45:06.257 --> 45:08.255
They're gonna fly back tonight.

45:08.257 --> 45:10.021
Happy anniversary.

45:13.090 --> 45:14.958
I love you so much.

45:15.857 --> 45:16.988
I love you, too.

45:19.891 --> 45:21.559
I'll go get a nurse.

45:22.725 --> 45:24.922
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

45:27.990 --> 45:28.991
Mm-hm.

45:35.023 --> 45:39.523
<i>Dr. Andrew Athos,
please call extension 4401.</i>

45:39.525 --> 45:41.958
<i>Dr. Athos, 4401.</i>

45:56.091 --> 45:57.592
Hello?

46:14.891 --> 46:16.558
- Connor?
- Mina.

46:17.624 --> 46:19.689
Listen to me.
You guys are in danger, okay?

46:19.691 --> 46:21.689
<i>Something just attacked
me in the antique store,</i>

46:21.691 --> 46:22.754
<i>and it might come for you.</i>

46:22.756 --> 46:24.957
<i>Just don't be by yourself.</i>

46:39.857 --> 46:41.288
Hello?

46:41.290 --> 46:43.459
Shit!

46:53.857 --> 46:54.925
Hello!

47:02.525 --> 47:03.925
What are you doing over there?

47:09.190 --> 47:11.790
I just talked to the nurse,
she said she'll be back...

47:56.257 --> 47:58.754
I'm telling you,
she didn't kill herself.

47:58.756 --> 48:00.222
- Okay?
- Look...

48:00.224 --> 48:01.988
You're not listening
to me.

48:01.990 --> 48:02.855
Try to relax.

48:02.857 --> 48:04.189
- What?
- I'll see what I can find out.

48:04.191 --> 48:05.687
I'll be back in a couple
of minutes.

48:05.689 --> 48:06.690
Okay.

48:19.524 --> 48:21.121
- I'm so sorry.
- Save it.

48:21.123 --> 48:22.690
You did this.

48:23.724 --> 48:25.556
She's dead 'cause of you!

48:25.558 --> 48:28.854
Devin, stop. It's not her fault.

48:28.856 --> 48:30.121
Isn't it?

48:30.123 --> 48:31.989
Who got the camera?

48:31.991 --> 48:33.559
Who took the photo?

48:33.857 --> 48:34.858
Huh?

48:36.257 --> 48:37.958
Sorry.

48:57.258 --> 48:58.723
Are you okay?

49:02.124 --> 49:03.591
No.

49:07.224 --> 49:09.621
It was the heat of the moment.
He didn't mean any of it.

49:09.623 --> 49:11.723
No, he's right.

49:12.590 --> 49:14.458
He's right, it is my fault.

49:17.557 --> 49:19.492
It's always my fault.

49:21.290 --> 49:22.757
What do you mean?

49:31.124 --> 49:32.724
My dad.

49:38.057 --> 49:39.658
He was a reporter.

49:40.956 --> 49:42.657
Worked for the town paper.

49:44.590 --> 49:47.754
Anyway, this one night,
when I was 12, he was driving me

49:47.756 --> 49:49.857
to a friend's house
for a sleepover.

49:50.724 --> 49:52.255
And we get about halfway there,

49:52.257 --> 49:54.788
and he says he wants
to take a detour

49:54.790 --> 49:57.121
to show me something
he was working on.

49:57.123 --> 50:00.723
But I just wanted to get
to the party.

50:02.724 --> 50:04.624
I told him I didn't care.

50:07.291 --> 50:08.988
So, he...

50:08.990 --> 50:10.890
turned the car around, and...

50:14.589 --> 50:16.524
That's when we got hit.

50:20.924 --> 50:22.189
It's my fault.

50:22.191 --> 50:24.055
Oh.

50:24.057 --> 50:25.289
It's always my fault.

50:25.291 --> 50:26.921
I'm so sorry.

50:26.923 --> 50:28.188
No.

50:28.190 --> 50:30.791
No, I'm sorry.

50:32.123 --> 50:34.590
I'm sorry.

50:39.257 --> 50:40.223
I bet if he were here
right now,

50:40.225 --> 50:42.025
he'd tell you
that this wasn't your fault.

50:46.724 --> 50:47.824
No.

50:50.190 --> 50:51.554
No. If he were here right now,

50:51.556 --> 50:53.857
he'd be trying
to figure out the "why."

51:42.923 --> 51:46.988
Grab anything between
October through December 1974.

51:58.024 --> 51:59.458
Got it.

52:21.991 --> 52:23.256
Oh, my god.

52:23.258 --> 52:25.588
In 1974, three kids
were abducted,

52:25.590 --> 52:28.155
and murdered in Locust Harbor.

52:28.157 --> 52:29.688
"Roland Joseph Sable,

52:29.690 --> 52:32.688
the man responsible
for the abduction and slaughter

52:32.690 --> 52:35.723
of three teens
was a photography teacher...

52:37.957 --> 52:39.658
at Locust Harbor High."

52:42.223 --> 52:44.457
Roland Joseph Sable.

52:49.690 --> 52:50.857
RJS.

52:53.223 --> 52:54.924
This was his camera.

52:57.991 --> 52:59.991
And this is
what he used it for.

53:03.723 --> 53:05.757
He took their pictures.

53:08.524 --> 53:10.587
"The suspect,
Roland Joseph Sable,

53:10.589 --> 53:11.854
was shot and killed

53:11.856 --> 53:14.057
before he could be taken
into custody."

53:24.689 --> 53:26.587
This is so messed up.

53:26.589 --> 53:27.854
I mean, we shouldn't have to die

53:27.856 --> 53:29.724
because we took
a stupid picture.

53:32.456 --> 53:35.121
And I wanna know how you got
away from it, and Mina didn't.

53:35.123 --> 53:36.787
I don't know, Devin.

53:36.789 --> 53:38.990
Now, would you sit down,
so we can figure this out?

53:40.257 --> 53:42.255
Okay, so...

53:42.257 --> 53:43.322
When it was coming after me,

53:43.324 --> 53:45.854
it got near something hot,
and it did this, like,

53:45.856 --> 53:48.587
weird blurry thing.

53:48.589 --> 53:51.557
"Blurry thing"? What do you...
What do you mean?

53:53.290 --> 53:55.021
When you develop photos,
you have to be careful,

53:55.023 --> 53:58.521
because heat and light
can mess up the images.

53:58.523 --> 53:59.621
What does that even mean?

53:59.623 --> 54:02.254
Maybe this thing behaves
just like a photograph does.

54:02.256 --> 54:04.021
Maybe it only develops
in the dark.

54:04.023 --> 54:05.755
That's why it's not here now.

54:05.757 --> 54:07.121
Look, we can't just wait
for this thing

54:07.123 --> 54:09.555
to kill us off, okay?

54:09.557 --> 54:11.121
Any one of us could be next.

54:11.123 --> 54:13.024
Okay, look. I found this, guys.

54:14.191 --> 54:15.821
Haunted photos.

54:15.823 --> 54:17.989
Cameras capturing ghosts.
I mean, this stuff is real.

54:17.991 --> 54:20.787
Yeah, but how is a shadow
in a photo coming after us?

54:20.789 --> 54:21.855
Cursed objects.

54:21.857 --> 54:24.855
Sometimes, things absorb energy
from their owners,

54:24.857 --> 54:25.889
and with ghosts,

54:25.891 --> 54:27.254
it's always that they have
unfinished business.

54:27.256 --> 54:29.787
Look, this is his house.

54:29.789 --> 54:32.022
Maybe someone named Sable
still lives there.

54:32.024 --> 54:33.491
Yeah, let me check.

54:37.124 --> 54:40.988
It says the house is owned
by an Anne Faraday as of 1977.

54:40.990 --> 54:42.058
Shit.

54:46.290 --> 54:48.587
We're wasting time, okay?

54:48.589 --> 54:49.821
And if we don't figure
something out,

54:49.823 --> 54:50.822
that thing's gonna
come back for us.

54:50.824 --> 54:52.724
Hey, we don't even know
how this thing works.

54:54.257 --> 54:55.790
I say we find out.

54:56.724 --> 54:58.254
Devin, put the camera down.

54:58.256 --> 55:00.021
- Stop.
- Don't touch me!

55:00.023 --> 55:01.122
- Stop!
- Let go of me!

55:01.124 --> 55:02.989
Let go!

55:26.223 --> 55:27.858
It was an accident.

55:31.823 --> 55:33.254
- Guys?
- I'm sorry.

55:33.256 --> 55:34.723
It's moving.

55:42.589 --> 55:44.457
It changed the order.

55:46.790 --> 55:47.888
Hey, hey, hey.

55:47.890 --> 55:49.254
- Devin, don't.
- Come on, come on.

55:49.256 --> 55:50.554
- I'm not gonna be next.
- Come on.

55:50.556 --> 55:52.287
Devin, stop. Stop. Put it down.

55:52.289 --> 55:53.255
This is her fault.

55:53.257 --> 55:54.321
Devin, put the camera
on the table, okay?

55:54.323 --> 55:56.555
If it weren't for her,
Mina would still be here.

55:56.557 --> 55:57.688
- That's not true, Devin.
- Devin.

55:57.690 --> 55:58.821
- It's her fault Mina is dead!
- No, it's not!

55:58.823 --> 56:00.154
- Devin, please put...
- Put it down!

56:00.156 --> 56:01.220
This is your fault.

56:01.222 --> 56:02.621
- Devin.
- Let go!

56:02.623 --> 56:03.921
Devin, please, come on.

56:03.923 --> 56:06.188
Devin, just put it down!

56:08.791 --> 56:10.858
What the hell?

56:25.256 --> 56:26.822
- What did you do to me?
- I didn't...

56:26.824 --> 56:27.955
- What did you do?
- Hey, hey, hey, Devin!

56:27.957 --> 56:29.721
- What did you do to me?
- Hey, hey, calm down.

56:29.723 --> 56:31.121
- What did you do?
- Hey, son.

56:31.123 --> 56:32.754
Is everything all right?

56:32.756 --> 56:33.790
Oh.

56:45.589 --> 56:47.555
You don't understand.
He's in danger.

56:47.557 --> 56:49.621
He's in danger of
getting charged with a felony.

56:49.623 --> 56:51.922
Oh, come on, man.
His girlfriend just died.

56:51.924 --> 56:53.188
He's not exactly in his...

56:53.190 --> 56:55.621
That doesn't mean he can haul
off and smack one of my guys.

56:55.623 --> 56:58.288
Listen, we took a photo of him,
and now this...

56:58.290 --> 57:00.154
thing inside the camera
is gonna come here...

57:00.156 --> 57:02.055
"Thing inside the camera"?

57:02.057 --> 57:03.921
I know how it sounds.

57:03.923 --> 57:07.187
But this camera belonged
to a serial killer,

57:07.189 --> 57:09.523
and now it's killing
our friends.

57:15.123 --> 57:16.857
Okay, look,
I know this has been...

57:18.623 --> 57:20.889
I understand this
has been hard on you.

57:20.891 --> 57:22.855
Avery's accident,
Mina's suicide, Tyler...

57:22.857 --> 57:24.922
It wasn't an accident
or a suicide.

57:24.924 --> 57:26.255
And I get that sometimes,

57:26.257 --> 57:27.989
to deal
with tragedies like this,

57:27.991 --> 57:29.121
we make up stories.

57:29.123 --> 57:30.254
- Urban legends.
- Right.

57:30.256 --> 57:31.587
Except this wasn't
an urban legend.

57:31.589 --> 57:33.255
This guy was real.

57:33.257 --> 57:34.821
He lived in this town
40 years ago,

57:34.823 --> 57:36.989
and his name
was Roland Joseph Sable.

57:36.991 --> 57:37.923
Look, I want you
to listen to me.

57:37.925 --> 57:40.154
Now, he's come back,
we have his camera,

57:40.156 --> 57:43.654
and... somehow, it's helping him
continue this murder spree...

57:43.656 --> 57:45.989
- You gotta stop this, now.
- Look, this is his house, okay?

57:45.991 --> 57:47.120
If we could just go there...

57:47.122 --> 57:49.121
Listen to me!

57:49.123 --> 57:50.254
Okay, if I get one peep
about you

57:50.256 --> 57:52.988
going anywhere near
that house...

57:52.990 --> 57:55.056
your friend in there
is gonna have a new roommate.

57:59.923 --> 58:01.988
Now,
I'll give you a minute with him.

58:01.990 --> 58:03.622
But then, I want you to go home.

58:03.624 --> 58:05.825
Leave all this alone.
This is police business.

58:07.223 --> 58:08.858
This is such bullshit.

58:17.990 --> 58:19.287
How's your hand?

58:19.289 --> 58:20.723
It hurts.

58:22.023 --> 58:23.491
I'm sorry...

58:24.056 --> 58:26.521
about what I said.

58:26.523 --> 58:28.153
I know Mina
wasn't your fault.

58:28.155 --> 58:29.054
But maybe me being next,

58:29.056 --> 58:30.990
will buy you guys the time
you need...

58:31.857 --> 58:32.990
to stop it.

58:51.857 --> 58:53.458
Oh, it's Kasey.

58:55.989 --> 58:58.521
Please tell me you found
an old neighbor or something.

58:58.523 --> 58:59.854
<i>No, I did one better.</i>

58:59.856 --> 59:01.555
- Really?
- Yeah, well, it turns out

59:01.557 --> 59:04.655
Anne Faraday didn't buy
the house in '77.

59:04.657 --> 59:06.655
<i>She just changed
the name on the deed.</i>

59:06.657 --> 59:08.588
Her real name is Lena Sable.

59:08.590 --> 59:10.053
<i>She's Roland's wife.</i>

59:10.055 --> 59:11.722
<i>You guys should go check out
the house.</i>

59:11.724 --> 59:13.255
<i>I'll stay here and keep diggin.</i>

01:00:13.523 --> 01:00:14.923
Can I help you?

01:00:15.289 --> 01:00:16.889
Hey, yeah, um...

01:00:18.856 --> 01:00:20.755
Mrs. Sable?

01:00:20.757 --> 01:00:22.053
There is no one here
by that name.

01:00:22.055 --> 01:00:24.557
Wait, please.
I have your husband's camera.

01:00:35.724 --> 01:00:37.721
Look, I know you changed
your name, okay?

01:00:37.723 --> 01:00:40.724
But you were
Mrs. Roland Joseph Sable, right?

01:00:44.557 --> 01:00:46.457
And this was his camera?

01:00:47.657 --> 01:00:48.724
No.

01:00:49.989 --> 01:00:51.120
Well...

01:00:51.122 --> 01:00:53.153
I mean,
it has his initials on it.

01:00:53.155 --> 01:00:54.557
Look.

01:00:54.990 --> 01:00:56.458
RJS.

01:01:02.922 --> 01:01:05.657
Rebecca Jane.

01:01:07.989 --> 01:01:09.724
Our daughter.

01:01:30.257 --> 01:01:32.221
What's going on out there?

01:03:25.023 --> 01:03:26.524
This is her?

01:03:30.155 --> 01:03:31.591
She's pretty.

01:03:40.022 --> 01:03:41.689
She was.

01:03:43.123 --> 01:03:44.524
Oh.

01:03:45.889 --> 01:03:47.591
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:03:48.723 --> 01:03:52.188
Um, what happened to her?

01:03:52.190 --> 01:03:55.854
That is the part
of the story

01:03:55.856 --> 01:03:58.686
no one ever talks about.

01:03:58.688 --> 01:04:00.954
See, just because
she was pretty,

01:04:00.956 --> 01:04:03.953
didn't mean she was
without issues.

01:04:03.955 --> 01:04:07.522
<i>Rebecca, bless her soul,
was slow.</i>

01:04:07.524 --> 01:04:09.657
<i>Lived in her own world.</i>

01:04:12.023 --> 01:04:15.020
<i>The only thing that seemed
to bring her out of it</i>

01:04:15.022 --> 01:04:17.588
<i>was that camera.</i>

01:04:17.856 --> 01:04:19.588
<i>After we gave it to her,</i>

01:04:19.590 --> 01:04:21.687
<i>she became attached to it.</i>

01:04:21.689 --> 01:04:22.887
<i>Took it everywhere with her.</i>

01:04:22.889 --> 01:04:25.820
Hey, camera girl!
You wanna take some pictures?

01:04:25.822 --> 01:04:28.721
<i>The kids at school
started to tease her for it.</i>

01:04:28.723 --> 01:04:32.088
<i>But, what started
as harmless whispers,</i>

01:04:32.090 --> 01:04:34.887
<i>somehow got out of hand.</i>

01:04:34.889 --> 01:04:38.187
<i>One night, four kids
tricked her into coming out.</i>

01:04:38.189 --> 01:04:41.053
<i>Poor Rebecca had no idea.</i>

01:04:42.622 --> 01:04:44.587
<i>They took her most
prized possession,</i>

01:04:44.589 --> 01:04:45.753
<i>and turned it against her.</i>

01:04:45.755 --> 01:04:47.853
<i>They took horrible photos</i>

01:04:47.855 --> 01:04:50.054
<i>no parent should ever
have to see.</i>

01:04:52.989 --> 01:04:58.053
<i>The next day, they passed
the photos around the school.</i>

01:04:58.055 --> 01:04:59.856
<i>Humiliated her.</i>

01:05:02.990 --> 01:05:06.088
<i>The embarrassment
was too much to bear.</i>

01:05:06.090 --> 01:05:08.857
<i>She... She couldn't handle it.</i>

01:05:09.990 --> 01:05:12.953
<i>We were both devastated.</i>

01:05:12.955 --> 01:05:16.787
<i>And then, Roland saw the photo.</i>

01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:19.621
<i>He became obsessed
with that camera,</i>

01:05:19.623 --> 01:05:23.024
with punishing those four kids
for their cruelty.

01:05:24.990 --> 01:05:27.789
He wanted to make them suffer.

01:05:30.557 --> 01:05:32.757
And he did.

01:05:35.656 --> 01:05:38.887
<i>My husband sought
a father's vengeance.</i>

01:05:40.856 --> 01:05:43.690
<i>His anger turned him
into a killer.</i>

01:05:44.723 --> 01:05:46.654
<i>Then they caught up with him</i>

01:05:46.656 --> 01:05:49.121
<i>down at the dark room
at the school.</i>

01:06:01.723 --> 01:06:03.954
<i>He died...</i>

01:06:03.956 --> 01:06:05.856
<i>...holding that camera.</i>

01:06:08.656 --> 01:06:11.121
The police confiscated
all the pictures,

01:06:11.123 --> 01:06:15.987
but I held on to this one.

01:06:15.989 --> 01:06:20.590
Roland told me he wouldn't stop
until they were all punished.

01:06:28.688 --> 01:06:31.491
He never got to finish
what he started.

01:06:38.756 --> 01:06:39.890
Oh, my god.

01:06:51.223 --> 01:06:53.522
One of them got away.

01:06:58.190 --> 01:07:00.757
Bird, we have to go now.

01:07:02.823 --> 01:07:03.856
Bird.

01:07:05.022 --> 01:07:06.853
Come on. It's... It's Devin.

01:07:06.855 --> 01:07:08.153
We have to go now.

01:07:08.155 --> 01:07:09.221
Now.

01:07:15.090 --> 01:07:17.088
<i>So, if Devin's dead,
then we're next.</i>

01:07:17.090 --> 01:07:18.520
I know. Look, Kasey,

01:07:18.522 --> 01:07:19.521
you gotta come meet us
at school, all right?

01:07:19.523 --> 01:07:21.154
- <i>Yeah, heading over now.</i>
- Okay. Bye.

01:07:21.156 --> 01:07:23.187
Wait. Are you sure about this?

01:07:23.189 --> 01:07:24.656
Yeah.

01:07:25.588 --> 01:07:27.489
I think I know how to fix this.

01:07:54.856 --> 01:07:56.121
Got it.

01:08:05.789 --> 01:08:06.790
No.

01:08:17.921 --> 01:08:18.990
Hello.

01:08:19.856 --> 01:08:20.957
Bird?

01:08:21.823 --> 01:08:23.720
Connor?

01:08:23.723 --> 01:08:25.622
No! Come on.

01:08:38.689 --> 01:08:39.721
Guys?

01:08:54.189 --> 01:08:55.856
Holy shit.

01:08:57.256 --> 01:08:58.857
Sheriff Pembroke.

01:09:15.555 --> 01:09:16.654
What are you doing here?

01:09:16.656 --> 01:09:18.154
What am I doing here?

01:09:18.156 --> 01:09:19.790
I'm the police.

01:09:21.290 --> 01:09:23.589
And you're all breaking
and entering.

01:09:28.756 --> 01:09:30.187
You followed us.

01:09:30.189 --> 01:09:31.122
You know
that we're right about...

01:09:31.124 --> 01:09:32.853
I followed you
because you've been taking

01:09:32.854 --> 01:09:35.554
this haunted camera thing
too far.

01:09:35.555 --> 01:09:36.720
Bothering the Sable woman...

01:09:36.721 --> 01:09:38.220
Oh, you're really concerned
that we're bothering her?

01:09:38.221 --> 01:09:39.854
Or maybe...

01:09:39.856 --> 01:09:41.990
you're afraid
of what she told us.

01:09:43.189 --> 01:09:44.953
Did she tell you
that I bullied her daughter

01:09:44.955 --> 01:09:46.721
until she killed herself?

01:09:52.189 --> 01:09:54.121
You're the one that got away.

01:09:56.189 --> 01:09:57.520
Put that thing down.

01:09:57.522 --> 01:09:59.287
I said put it down.

01:09:59.289 --> 01:10:01.889
Bird, listen to me.
Put that thing away.

01:10:02.722 --> 01:10:04.987
Connor, I can't do it.

01:10:04.989 --> 01:10:05.855
Give it to me.

01:10:05.857 --> 01:10:07.055
- Put it down.
- The only way he'll stop

01:10:07.057 --> 01:10:09.286
- is if he gets the fourth.
- Put it away.

01:10:09.288 --> 01:10:10.854
Shut it off!

01:10:17.222 --> 01:10:18.756
I'm sorry.

01:10:19.589 --> 01:10:20.453
I really am.

01:10:20.455 --> 01:10:23.654
I know it was
a long time ago, but...

01:10:23.656 --> 01:10:25.988
our friends are all dying
because of what you did.

01:10:25.990 --> 01:10:28.057
Oh, Jesus, you got it all wrong.

01:10:29.722 --> 01:10:33.187
We tried to get her away
from him.

01:10:33.189 --> 01:10:35.823
<i>We didn't
take those photos of Rebecca.</i>

01:10:37.622 --> 01:10:39.457
<i>Her father did.</i>

01:10:40.123 --> 01:10:41.887
<i>We tried to get the pictures,</i>

01:10:41.889 --> 01:10:44.220
<i>so we could take them
to the police.</i>

01:10:44.222 --> 01:10:46.721
<i>But he found out and snapped.</i>

01:10:46.723 --> 01:10:48.521
<i>Went crazy,</i>

01:10:48.523 --> 01:10:50.521
<i>came after us,
killed us one by one,</i>

01:10:50.523 --> 01:10:53.254
<i>to make sure his secret
never came out.</i>

01:10:54.855 --> 01:10:57.687
<i>He took pleasure
in our suffering.</i>

01:10:57.689 --> 01:11:00.024
<i>Thank god the police got there
before he could kill me.</i>

01:11:02.588 --> 01:11:04.520
<i>But Rebecca...</i>

01:11:04.522 --> 01:11:06.987
<i>couldn't live with the guilt.</i>

01:11:06.989 --> 01:11:08.722
<i>That's why she hung herself.</i>

01:11:09.255 --> 01:11:10.621
Check the dates.

01:11:10.623 --> 01:11:12.990
Rebecca killed herself
after the murders.

01:11:15.190 --> 01:11:16.924
Rebecca was my friend.

01:11:17.856 --> 01:11:19.087
We were all her friends.

01:11:19.089 --> 01:11:20.054
Lena Sable told us...

01:11:20.056 --> 01:11:22.587
Lena Sable stood by
while all this happened.

01:11:22.589 --> 01:11:25.088
Of course, she's gonna
concoct some batshit story.

01:11:25.090 --> 01:11:28.054
She's been blaming me
and my friends ever since.

01:11:31.589 --> 01:11:33.057
He's coming.

01:11:45.055 --> 01:11:46.489
Behind you.

01:11:56.589 --> 01:11:59.121
Shoot him! Shoot him!

01:12:45.689 --> 01:12:46.723
Run!

01:12:47.255 --> 01:12:48.690
Come on.

01:13:19.588 --> 01:13:21.553
Bird,
he's getting closer. Go!

01:13:21.555 --> 01:13:23.287
It's stuck!

01:13:23.289 --> 01:13:25.853
- Get the door! Get the door!
- I am! Okay!

01:13:25.855 --> 01:13:26.990
Come on! Go!

01:13:39.023 --> 01:13:40.723
It's a dead end.

01:13:41.522 --> 01:13:42.586
We need heat.

01:14:52.222 --> 01:14:54.720
I have to go
find Connor. Okay?

01:14:54.722 --> 01:14:56.723
You'll be safe here
until I get back.

01:15:43.588 --> 01:15:44.988
We can't stop it.

01:15:46.889 --> 01:15:48.489
Look, he's still there.

01:15:49.989 --> 01:15:53.723
Once it takes your picture,
it uses it against you.

01:15:56.855 --> 01:15:58.052
Wait.

01:15:58.054 --> 01:15:59.887
What?

01:15:59.889 --> 01:16:01.953
Connor, we have to get
the camera.

01:16:01.955 --> 01:16:03.553
We have to take it some place
where that thing

01:16:03.555 --> 01:16:04.856
is gonna be fully formed.

01:16:12.789 --> 01:16:15.690
- Come on. Let's go.
- Okay. Go.

01:16:23.588 --> 01:16:25.656
Okay, okay. Quick.

01:16:44.989 --> 01:16:46.887
Connor!

01:16:46.889 --> 01:16:48.119
Bird!

01:17:07.588 --> 01:17:09.823
Bird, he's coming. Run!

01:17:10.922 --> 01:17:13.587
Run! Bird! Run!

01:17:13.589 --> 01:17:16.053
Run, Bird! He's coming for you!

01:17:16.055 --> 01:17:17.457
Run!

01:17:22.988 --> 01:17:23.989
Okay.

01:19:19.188 --> 01:19:20.722
Fuck you.

01:20:46.854 --> 01:20:47.856
Ah!

01:21:25.989 --> 01:21:28.253
- Hey.
- My god. You're okay.

01:21:28.255 --> 01:21:29.888
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:21:31.288 --> 01:21:32.955
We thought you were dead.

01:21:37.787 --> 01:21:38.989
Is it over?

01:21:49.889 --> 01:21:50.988
He's gone.

01:21:55.888 --> 01:21:58.053
- He's gone.
- Guys?

01:21:58.055 --> 01:21:59.789
We should sit down.

01:22:02.088 --> 01:22:04.588
Easy, easy.

01:22:05.588 --> 01:22:08.589
I'm never doing
another stupid photo bomb.

01:22:15.688 --> 01:22:17.722
You should take her
to the hospital.

01:22:20.787 --> 01:22:21.856
Hey.

01:22:23.855 --> 01:22:25.023
What about you?

01:22:27.554 --> 01:22:29.589
- You're hurt.
- I know.

01:22:31.255 --> 01:22:33.489
There's something
I have to do first.

01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:10.680
