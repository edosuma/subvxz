mankind has been the dominant species.

We've domesticated
animals, locked them up,

00:09.176 --> 00:10.644

events seem to suggest

00:13.764 --> 00:18.395
all across the globe animals
have decided "no more."

00:18.852 --> 00:20.195

happening with the animals,

00:37.955 --> 00:41.926
why it's happening,
and how to stop it.

- Watch yourself, scrawny.

01:06.817 --> 01:07.943

01:08.110 --> 01:11.990
The awakening of the
animals' cognitive acuity.

01:12.155 --> 01:15.329
The defiant pupil is a signifier

01:15.492 --> 01:18.416
that the way the animals see
the world is now changing.

- Yeah, I am.
- What'd they do to your hometown?

01:28.505 --> 01:29.677
They murdered it.

01:29.840 --> 01:32.935
But I need the truth, Mr. Hartley.
Did you kill my husband?
