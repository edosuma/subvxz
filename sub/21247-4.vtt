doing here, hawk?

03:14.278 --> 03:16.945
The Pride Lands aren't
your hunting grounds.

03:16.981 --> 03:20.182
But the Pride Lands

Mmm. It is good
to try new food...

03:30.327 --> 03:33.061
Uh, but you still
can't hunt here.

03:33.097 --> 03:34.463
That's right.

03:34.498 --> 03:37.299
The reason there are
so many different animals
in the Pride Lands

03:37.334 --> 03:40.302
is because we all respect
the Circle of Life.

03:40.337 --> 03:42.137
I hope you'll do the same,

03:42.172 --> 03:44.273

to your own territory.

03:44.308 --> 03:45.307
Fine.

03:45.342 --> 03:47.009
I'll go home.

05:00.250 --> 05:02.150
Any idea whose egg it is?

05:02.186 --> 05:05.253
Hmm... Judging by the speckles
and the size,

05:05.289 --> 05:07.122
I'd say it belongs
to a hammerkop.

05:07.157 --> 05:10.158
But why would a hammerkop
leave its egg in your nest?

05:10.194 --> 05:11.259
I don't know.

05:11.295 --> 05:13.996
Hammerkops are usually
excellent parents.

05:14.031 --> 05:16.098
Then there has to be
a good reason.

05:16.133 --> 05:18.266

05:37.121 --> 05:38.387
Does that mean
it's close to hatching?

05:38.422 --> 05:41.323
Yes. It will need someone
to sit on it to keep it warm

05:41.358 --> 05:43.291

ready to be born.

05:43.327 --> 05:44.359

21:19.295 --> 21:21.062
And that's why
I want to thank you

21:21.097 --> 21:22.296
with something special.

21:22.332 --> 21:25.132
I want to name
my baby after you.

21:25.168 --> 21:26.367
Two Onos?

21:26.402 --> 21:28.102
Won't that be confusing?

21:28.137 --> 21:29.203
No.

21:29.238 --> 21:33.140
The baby's a girl,
so I'm naming her "Ona."

21:34.010 --> 21:35.076
(CHIRPING)

21:35.111 --> 21:36.410
(CHUCKLES) Hey...

21:36.446 --> 21:37.979
She likes it!

21:38.014 --> 21:39.347
I'm gonna miss you, Ona.

21:39.382 --> 21:41.282
But I promise
I'll visit, okay?

21:41.317 --> 21:43.084
You're welcome anytime.

21:43.119 --> 21:44.986
But we consider you
family now,

21:45.021 --> 21:49.023
so when you do visit,
you know what you have to do.

21:49.058 --> 21:50.424
(SIGHS) Okay.

21:50.460 --> 21:52.360
I'll give it a try.

21:52.395 --> 21:54.095
(ALL CHIRPING)

21:54.130 --> 21:56.964
(ALL EXCLAIM)
Aw. That's nice.
