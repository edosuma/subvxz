[air traffic control chatter]

01:55.680 --> 02:00.163

03:07.404 --> 03:09.537

03:13.497 --> 03:14.324
Thanks.

03:17.762 --> 03:19.199
[coughing]

03:19.242 --> 03:21.940
- Made by a friend, burns
a little when you piss

03:21.984 --> 03:24.378
but hell of a fine drunk.

03:31.776 --> 03:34.562
[items rustling]

03:35.867 --> 03:36.694
Thanks, sweet pea.

03:39.175 --> 03:40.220
- You a regular here?

03:43.135 --> 03:44.049
- About that time.

03:45.181 --> 03:46.269
- You going to
Sportsman's Lodge too?

03:46.313 --> 03:50.230
- Sure, kid, I'm
flying you there.

03:51.361 --> 03:54.103
[dramatic music]

03:57.280 --> 03:59.282
So, you're the new watchman.

03:59.326 --> 04:02.764
- No, I'm just filling
in for couple of weeks.

04:02.807 --> 04:05.419
Photographer, photojournalist.

04:05.462 --> 04:09.684
- Fuck me, they must be
desperate. [chuckling]

04:09.727 --> 04:12.164
- Yeah, well, just trying
to get some quick cash,

04:12.208 --> 04:13.165
some good shots.

04:14.645 --> 04:16.038
- First time to Haida Gwaii?

04:16.081 --> 04:16.908
- Yeah.

04:19.171 --> 04:21.608
- Man, islands at
the end of the sky.

04:21.652 --> 04:23.001
Ice age missed 'em, you know?

04:23.872 --> 04:25.177
The legends are,

04:25.221 --> 04:27.484
some of the strangest
I ever fucking heard.

04:30.095 --> 04:35.013
Oh and watch yourself,
low salmon run this year.

05:29.241 --> 05:31.374
[men laughing]

05:31.418 --> 05:32.549
- Hey buddy!

05:32.593 --> 05:34.159
- You gotta watch
out for this guy.

05:34.203 --> 05:37.859
Last time he had a couple of
drinks he tried to fuck a deer.

05:39.034 --> 05:41.123
- That didn't happen,
Kohler, geeze.

05:42.733 --> 05:45.214
You must be Jacob.
- It's just Jake.

05:45.257 --> 05:46.346
- Call me Sparky.

05:48.086 --> 05:49.044
- Seriously?

05:49.087 --> 05:50.611
- [laughing] Yeah.

05:50.654 --> 05:52.439
There's some
goodies in the back.

05:52.482 --> 05:54.745
- Oh, great, okay.

05:56.225 --> 05:58.532
- You boys stay out
of each other's bunks.

05:59.533 --> 06:01.404
[man laughs]

06:01.448 --> 06:02.797

[tense music]
[engine humming]

06:11.066 --> 06:13.024
These the only shoes you got?

06:13.068 --> 06:13.982
- What?

06:15.549 --> 06:19.379
- What, are you a size
nine, nine and a half?

06:19.422 --> 06:20.684
- Yeah, nine and a half.

06:20.728 --> 06:22.425
- Let's see what we got.

06:22.469 --> 06:25.167

[dramatic music]

08:06.747 --> 08:09.445
[birds calling]

08:14.624 --> 08:16.278
- Haida Gwaii forms a
dagger-shaped archipelago

08:16.321 --> 08:18.585
of over 150 islands.

08:20.935 --> 08:23.503
Located 90 miles from the
west coast of British Columbia

08:23.546 --> 08:26.288
and just over 60 miles
to the Alaskan Panhandle.

08:32.642 --> 08:36.341
Haida Gwaii's first settlements
date back over 13,000 years.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.563
It's considered by some
scientists the Pacific route

08:41.607 --> 08:44.698
taken by the first humans
that migrated to the Americas.

08:54.359 --> 08:57.058
During the Ice Age, glaciers
receded from Haida Gwaii

08:57.101 --> 08:59.060
2000 years earlier
than the mainland.

09:03.891 --> 09:07.198
Nicknamed the Galapagos of
the North, the islands make up

09:07.242 --> 09:10.288
a unique biocultural zone
with many ancient plants

09:10.332 --> 09:13.509
and animals found nowhere
else in the world.

11:50.187 --> 11:52.146
- Jake, time to get going!

11:56.237 --> 11:57.064
- Fuck.

12:03.940 --> 12:05.289
Shit.

12:10.294 --> 12:11.165
[knocking]

12:11.208 --> 12:13.167
Yeah, fuck, I'm up, I'm up.

[soft music]

12:58.473 --> 13:01.955
[people speaking faintly]

13:20.408 --> 13:23.498
- Hang on there Sparks, I've
got him on the line right now.

13:23.541 --> 13:25.369
Oh sure, get back to me
on that count by tomorrow

13:25.413 --> 13:26.806
if you can darling, over.

13:27.894 --> 13:30.157
- Very good,
thanks, Donna, over.

13:30.200 --> 13:32.159
- Anything for you, honey buns.

13:32.202 --> 13:34.161
[kissing]
[Sparky laughing]

13:34.204 --> 13:36.206
I don't want you going
hungry down there.

13:36.250 --> 13:37.904
Especially with the
new kid joining you.

13:37.947 --> 13:38.818
- Oh baby.

13:40.123 --> 13:41.864
- Oh hey, you tried on
those PJs I sent you?

13:41.908 --> 13:43.823
You know they're not
real silk but they sure--

13:43.866 --> 13:47.261
- I got to get back to you
tomorrow, over and out.

13:49.306 --> 13:50.133
Hey.

13:54.485 --> 13:56.357
Boots and everything
fitting all right?

13:56.400 --> 13:57.619
- All a perfect fit.

13:58.620 --> 14:00.622
- Right, cool.

14:02.363 --> 14:03.973
I got a lot of work to do, so.

14:05.801 --> 14:09.849
- Welcome to Sportsman's
Lodge in Quinna Sound.

14:09.892 --> 14:14.549
Opened in 1911, originally
it was called Sporter's Lodge

14:14.592 --> 14:18.945
until she burnt to the
ground, was rebuilt in 1955.

14:18.988 --> 14:20.250
- What's with the dead trees?

14:21.382 --> 14:23.906
- We got some heavy
winds this time of year,

14:23.950 --> 14:27.083
bit of a dust up but
firewood is free.

14:28.650 --> 14:30.391
You take a shower?

14:30.434 --> 14:31.261
- Yeah, why?

14:32.523 --> 14:33.698
- With soap?

14:33.742 --> 14:35.091
- No, fucking gasoline.

14:36.745 --> 14:39.748
- You take a shower,
I recommend no soap,

14:39.791 --> 14:41.141
nothing with perfume.

14:42.577 --> 14:43.447
Bugs love it.

14:44.709 --> 14:47.756
No one to impress up
here anyway. [laughing]

14:48.670 --> 14:51.542
Mostly what we do this
time of year is repairs,

14:51.586 --> 14:54.023
groundskeeping,
winterizing, you know.

14:57.244 --> 14:58.593
What's this for?

14:59.768 --> 15:01.378
- I'm a photographer.

15:02.771 --> 15:06.253
- Oh, well, you should get some
real nice pictures up here.

15:09.169 --> 15:10.997
What you do there,
you cut yourself?

15:12.172 --> 15:15.175
- Heat rash jerking off.

15:15.218 --> 15:17.568
- [chuckling] Okay.

15:18.700 --> 15:20.528
This here's the water tank.

15:20.571 --> 15:22.095
We pump the water up
from the well through

15:22.138 --> 15:23.792
the chlorine system.

15:23.835 --> 15:25.750
But when the temperature
drops below zero

15:25.794 --> 15:27.187
the pipes'll freeze.

15:27.230 --> 15:29.841
One winter we went three
weeks without running water.

15:29.885 --> 15:32.801
And I'm not gonna let
that happen again.

15:34.846 --> 15:38.154
See?
[machine running]

15:38.198 --> 15:40.983
- Hey, hey, what's
that shed used for?

15:42.637 --> 15:44.247
- It had a leak,
I had to emptiy it out.

15:44.291 --> 15:46.032
- I've been looking for
a place to maybe store

15:46.075 --> 15:47.990
some darkroom equipment.

15:48.034 --> 15:51.254
- There's nothing pretty about
it, but you wanna fix it up,

15:51.298 --> 15:52.603
you can use it.

15:52.647 --> 15:54.170
- That'd be great.

15:54.214 --> 15:56.129
- It's real nice
to have you around.

15:57.521 --> 15:59.610
I'm not in as good a
shape as I used to be,

15:59.654 --> 16:03.701
so having a little help
this time of year is just real n

16:03.745 --> 16:04.572
- No problem.

16:06.791 --> 16:09.011
- This here's the
hardware store.

16:09.055 --> 16:10.839
Got a few projects on the go.

16:13.146 --> 16:16.671
Obviously we do our own building
and marine repairs here.

16:18.107 --> 16:20.936
Now, have you ever done any
repair work before, Jake?

16:23.156 --> 16:25.158
- Took a lawnmower
repair class in school.

16:25.201 --> 16:27.638
- Ah, good work with that.

16:28.639 --> 16:30.163
- Whatever you say, Zippy.

16:30.206 --> 16:33.731
- Oh, good one,
the name's Sparky.

16:35.472 --> 16:37.692
This is a genny, it's
water cooled and requires

16:37.735 --> 16:39.824
a constant top up with diesel.

16:39.868 --> 16:41.870
And these things
sometimes get loose

16:41.913 --> 16:43.915
so you gotta check 'em out.

16:43.959 --> 16:45.265
Oh yeah, this one's
loose right here.

16:45.308 --> 16:46.701
You wanna give it a whirl?

16:46.744 --> 16:50.357
Come on, give that a whirl,
come on, there you go.

16:54.056 --> 16:57.364
Now easy now, damn it,
you're stripping it now!

16:57.407 --> 16:59.366
Just take it easy there, okay.

17:00.628 --> 17:02.673
Aw damn it!

17:02.717 --> 17:05.198
[tense music]

17:27.089 --> 17:29.352
[knocking]

18:56.874 --> 18:59.138
[coughing]

19:08.277 --> 19:09.757
Jake, hey.

19:09.800 --> 19:12.020
You caught me having
a little puff here.

19:13.674 --> 19:16.285
My homegrown, it
helps with the hips.

19:16.329 --> 19:17.330
- Sure it does.

19:21.595 --> 19:22.857
- What do you have there?

19:24.119 --> 19:26.687
- A little tobacco and hash.

19:36.218 --> 19:39.134
Thanks.
- Yeah.

19:47.055 --> 19:48.926
- Been out here
for a while, huh?

19:48.970 --> 19:50.014
- 12 seasons.

19:51.929 --> 19:54.236
Been guiding and doing winters.

19:54.280 --> 19:56.630
Four straight, year around.

19:57.544 --> 19:58.371
- No shit.

20:00.416 --> 20:02.157
You ever miss the
real world then?

20:05.421 --> 20:06.248
- Real world?

20:10.209 --> 20:14.996
Come on, Jake, I have
everything I need up here.

20:17.085 --> 20:19.261
- It must get
lonely, doesn't it?

20:19.305 --> 20:20.306
- Sometimes.

20:22.133 --> 20:24.005
Had this cat that hung around.

20:25.311 --> 20:28.575
But I ain't seen him lately.

20:31.578 --> 20:34.407
- In that case, how often do
you and Donna see each other?

20:34.450 --> 20:36.670
You two are--
- Donna?

20:36.713 --> 20:38.541
No, no, no, Donna, she's
up in the headquarters

20:38.585 --> 20:39.455
up in Alaska.

20:42.023 --> 20:43.981
How about yourself, Jake?

20:44.025 --> 20:45.679
You have a special
girl back home?

20:50.379 --> 20:51.598
- Seriously, sounds like

20:51.641 --> 20:53.643
she was wet for you
though, Sprinkles.

20:53.687 --> 20:58.605
- Hold on now, Jake, Donna's
your superior and no.

21:00.476 --> 21:04.524
I'm telling you, never
even met face to face.

21:04.567 --> 21:06.090
- So you're telling me
you never busted through

21:06.134 --> 21:08.310
those cobwebs, that's
what you're telling me?

21:10.660 --> 21:11.879
- Come on, Jake.

21:13.794 --> 21:15.796
You're getting a bit
disrespectful here.

21:17.188 --> 21:20.017
- I'm just saying,
think about it.

21:24.152 --> 21:26.633
[owl hooting]

[deep rumbling]

24:45.614 --> 24:48.138
[tense music]

25:02.283 --> 25:03.110
Sparky!

25:04.111 --> 25:05.547
- Oh hey, Jake.

25:05.591 --> 25:07.114
- What the fuck, man?

25:07.157 --> 25:10.639
- Oh sorry, man, the
damn martens are chewing

25:10.683 --> 25:11.858
up my lawn again.

25:13.816 --> 25:14.991
Think I got 'em though.

25:20.301 --> 25:21.781
- Congratulations.

26:24.278 --> 26:26.933
[eerie humming]

26:35.289 --> 26:36.986
- Hey, hey.

26:37.030 --> 26:39.467
[soft music]

26:50.957 --> 26:52.785
- The islands' inhabitants
developed a culture made rich

26:52.828 --> 26:54.874
by the abundance
of land and sea.

26:56.310 --> 26:58.921
[gulls crying]

27:04.448 --> 27:07.582
Noted seafarers, they occupied
more than 100 villages

27:07.626 --> 27:08.670
throughout the islands.

27:14.981 --> 27:16.504
They were skilled traders.

27:17.810 --> 27:19.638
The islands played an important
role during the maritime

27:19.681 --> 27:23.642
fur trade era of the late
18 to early 19th centuries.

27:25.078 --> 27:27.776
Haida Gwaii is home to
an abundance of wildlife.

27:27.820 --> 27:32.041
There are nearly
7000 rare species.

27:32.085 --> 27:36.263
Most notable is the Queen
Charlotte black bear.

27:36.306 --> 27:38.961
A native subspecies known
for its exceptionally large

27:39.005 --> 27:40.267
jaws and teeth.

[soft music]

29:12.402 --> 29:14.753
[long sigh]

29:22.891 --> 29:25.241
[long sigh]

29:28.288 --> 29:30.551
[rustling]

30:29.392 --> 30:31.960
[wind blowing]

[rustling]

31:00.032 --> 31:01.685
[elk warbling]

31:01.729 --> 31:03.339
Fuck!

31:03.383 --> 31:08.388
[heavy breathing]
[dramatic music]

31:18.311 --> 31:22.576
[bear growling]
[Jake yelping]

31:22.619 --> 31:25.187
[Jake panting]

32:07.360 --> 32:09.710
[deep sigh]

32:16.021 --> 32:20.721
[rustling]
[eerie music]

32:46.877 --> 32:50.142
Well, think I know what
happened to your cat.

32:52.535 --> 32:53.667
- Little White Lightning?

33:01.066 --> 33:03.111
[coughing]

33:03.155 --> 33:08.160
- More, more.
[Sparky laughing]

33:09.509 --> 33:11.119
Should have read your
fucking horoscope today, kid.

33:21.173 --> 33:23.697
[tense music]

33:36.840 --> 33:39.582
[fire crackling]

33:50.506 --> 33:55.511
[birds cawing]
[water pouring]

33:56.947 --> 33:59.646
[metal rattling]

34:47.172 --> 34:49.087
[spitting]

34:49.130 --> 34:50.739
- Fuck's sake.

34:50.784 --> 34:53.003
- You ever fire one
of these before?

34:54.483 --> 34:55.310
- No.

34:56.442 --> 34:57.269
- Wanna learn?

35:00.794 --> 35:01.621
- Okay.

35:02.926 --> 35:05.277
[soft music]

35:29.388 --> 35:31.041
- Water level's
higher than normal,

35:31.085 --> 35:33.348
hike up your socks, Jake!

35:33.392 --> 35:35.742
Hey, watch those ones,
they're real slippery.

35:54.587 --> 35:55.414
Come on, Jake!

35:57.851 --> 35:59.983
[laughing]

36:00.027 --> 36:01.507
- Yeah, laugh it up.

36:05.163 --> 36:06.338
My foot's fucking freezing.

36:08.514 --> 36:10.516
- It's all part of
the adventure, buddy.

36:13.693 --> 36:15.956
[bird calling]

36:15.999 --> 36:18.698
Another watchman and I set
this up a few years back.

36:20.221 --> 36:22.180
It's a great place
to let off some steam

36:23.268 --> 36:25.966
and learn to protect yourself.

36:26.009 --> 36:29.926
Rule one, always the treat
the gun as if it were loaded.

36:29.970 --> 36:30.797
- All right.

36:31.667 --> 36:34.322
- Whoa! [laughing]

36:34.366 --> 36:36.846
Rule two, be careful where

36:36.890 --> 36:39.458
you point the damn
thing, all right?

36:40.981 --> 36:43.810
Rule three, keep your finger
off the trigger, all right?

36:45.812 --> 36:49.990
Aim down the sights,
square your feet up a bit.

36:50.033 --> 36:54.908
There you go, now you
aim, and then you squeeze.

36:56.344 --> 36:58.999
[clicking]
Just like that.

36:59.042 --> 37:01.393
- I think I got it.
- Okay.

37:07.050 --> 37:08.138
There you go.

37:12.795 --> 37:16.669
Okay, square your feet,
aim your front foot

37:16.712 --> 37:17.800
towards the target.

37:23.415 --> 37:25.460
[shot firing]

37:25.504 --> 37:26.331
- Fuck!

37:27.941 --> 37:29.377
You could have
warned me about that.

37:29.421 --> 37:30.248
- You all right?

37:32.424 --> 37:35.905
There you go, okay, same thing.

37:35.949 --> 37:38.081
This time old the butt
right against your shoulder

37:38.125 --> 37:40.997
like that, nice and tight
so you don't get a kick

37:41.041 --> 37:42.869
like that again, okay?

37:44.914 --> 37:46.742
All right, it's all you,
this time.

37:51.791 --> 37:53.271
[shot firing]

37:53.314 --> 37:56.012
- Yeah, you see that?

37:56.056 --> 37:58.450
- Oh my god, buddy.
- Whoo!

38:02.584 --> 38:04.847
- You've earned that, holy shit.

38:07.763 --> 38:10.636
[animals chirping]

38:21.386 --> 38:23.301
- Kohelr said something
about these islands.

38:24.476 --> 38:25.955
Said strange things happen here,

38:25.999 --> 38:27.783
you know what he
was talking about?

38:29.002 --> 38:31.657
- I've never been a
superstitious guy personally.

38:34.355 --> 38:37.315
Never seen anything to give
those old stories any credence.

38:38.403 --> 38:39.317
- What do you mean?

38:40.970 --> 38:43.886
What if you saw something
you couldn't explain?

38:43.930 --> 38:45.888
[tense music]

38:45.932 --> 38:47.934
- Think I'd keep that to myself.

38:47.977 --> 38:48.891
[shot firing]
[Sparky yelling]

38:48.935 --> 38:50.415
- Jesus, Sparky, what the fuck?

38:51.285 --> 38:53.896
[Sparky laughing]

38:53.940 --> 38:54.810
- Got him!

38:57.422 --> 39:02.383
One more down. [growling]

39:02.992 --> 39:05.343
[dramatic music]

39:27.539 --> 39:30.193
[Jake sighing]

39:51.563 --> 39:54.392
[liquid pouring]

41:01.937 --> 41:03.112
- Sparky.
- Hey.

41:04.244 --> 41:05.854
- Going to head out,
get some shots, thinking

41:05.898 --> 41:07.769
maybe I could borrow the rifle?

41:07.813 --> 41:10.729
- Tide's changing, I'm
dropping a couple rods.

41:12.078 --> 41:14.123
- I actually wouldn't
mind coming on the boat

41:14.167 --> 41:16.386
with you sometime, getting
some shots on the water.

41:16.430 --> 41:17.257
- Sure.

41:18.476 --> 41:19.302
Another time?

41:20.216 --> 41:21.261
- The rifle then.

41:25.047 --> 41:26.832
- Not sure that's
a good idea, Jake.

41:34.753 --> 41:37.451
[door creaking]

41:51.421 --> 41:54.076
[motor humming]

42:06.219 --> 42:09.004
[dramatic music]

42:13.705 --> 42:16.098
- The islands are home to
large forests with a wide

42:16.142 --> 42:19.928
variety of ancient trees,
including the spruce,

42:19.972 --> 42:23.018
western red cedar,
yellow cedar, shore pine,

42:23.062 --> 42:26.326
western hemlock, mountain
hemlock, and red alder.

42:29.459 --> 42:32.288
And then there's the rare and
magnificent golden spruce.

42:33.725 --> 42:36.728
A naturally occurring genetic
mutation causes the needles

42:36.771 --> 42:39.600
of some Haida Gwaii spruces
to have a golden hue.

42:41.297 --> 42:44.126
Lacking pigment to protect its
leaves from excess sunlight

42:44.170 --> 42:46.172
the golden spruces should
have withered and died

42:46.215 --> 42:47.913
but instead they
have flourished.

44:38.458 --> 44:40.678
[rustling]

44:42.375 --> 44:45.247
[glass shattering]

44:49.687 --> 44:52.690
[people chattering]

45:43.001 --> 45:45.220
[rustling]

46:26.653 --> 46:29.395
[child grunting]

46:34.661 --> 46:35.575
Anna.

46:38.491 --> 46:39.318
Anna!

46:54.072 --> 46:55.290
Anna!

47:04.169 --> 47:06.693
Anna, wait, Anna, wait please!

47:07.650 --> 47:09.478
Please don't leave me.

47:09.522 --> 47:14.527
[screeching]
[dramatic music]

47:17.399 --> 47:19.097
[Jake grunting]

47:19.140 --> 47:19.967
Fuck!

47:35.722 --> 47:38.377
[elk squealing]

48:25.467 --> 48:27.774
[rustling]

48:52.233 --> 48:54.453
[shouting]

49:21.480 --> 49:22.307
Ah!

49:45.678 --> 49:47.114
- Day off.

49:47.158 --> 49:48.681
Come on, we're going fishing.

49:59.039 --> 50:01.694
[reel creaking]

50:25.631 --> 50:29.374
You know why fish make
lousy hockey players?

50:31.985 --> 50:32.812
- What?

50:34.553 --> 50:38.035
- Because they're afraid
of the net. [chuckling]

50:41.125 --> 50:42.604
- You're a funny guy, Sparky.

50:48.219 --> 50:51.004
- Thought you were
just going for a walk.

50:51.048 --> 50:52.919
- Yeah, I passed out.

50:52.962 --> 50:54.703
- Well how the hell
far did you get?

50:57.097 --> 50:58.838
Because I looked
all over for you.

51:02.320 --> 51:06.411
What's wrong with you
there, you got a rash?

51:09.675 --> 51:10.502
- Just allergies.

51:13.331 --> 51:18.249
- You know it's just you and
me out here, no one else.

51:21.948 --> 51:23.819
So the next time
you go for a walk--

51:23.863 --> 51:25.995
- Why don't you just mind
your fucking business, friend?

51:26.039 --> 51:27.736
- Hey, hold it there, Jake.

51:29.173 --> 51:31.740
I need your friendship like
I need a kick in the teeth.

51:34.569 --> 51:35.831
Do your damn job.

51:38.791 --> 51:42.011
And I know you been sneaking
supplies from my shed.

51:42.055 --> 51:45.928
I see everything around here--
- I'm sick of your shit!

51:49.541 --> 51:52.761
[plane engine roaring]

52:00.160 --> 52:04.033
- Hey, you cocksuckers.
[chuckling]

52:04.077 --> 52:07.863
Sorry to interrupt you
there, nice glassy day.

52:07.907 --> 52:09.169
- How you doing, Kohler?

52:09.213 --> 52:11.606
- Oh, me?

52:11.650 --> 52:12.781
I need a drink.

52:14.435 --> 52:17.569
Holy hell, Sparky.

52:18.657 --> 52:21.442
You been working the
piss out of him or what?

52:21.486 --> 52:22.574
- He had a rough day.

52:23.923 --> 52:24.924
- No shit.

52:27.492 --> 52:30.016
[man panting]

52:32.758 --> 52:35.630
And got another one.
- Thank you sir.

52:35.674 --> 52:38.503
[Kohler laughing]

52:44.552 --> 52:49.557
[mellow music]
[liquid pouring]

52:55.215 --> 52:59.176
[rustling drowning out singing]

53:07.227 --> 53:10.187
- They tell you boys about
the storm?

53:10.230 --> 53:12.101
- Another blower?

53:12.145 --> 53:14.103
- Not another pussyfart.

53:14.147 --> 53:15.975
- They're calling
for category three.

53:18.456 --> 53:22.808
- God damn, how long?

53:23.852 --> 53:26.638
- Day after next, southwesterly.

53:28.030 --> 53:30.990
It's gonna be one dirty whore.

53:32.470 --> 53:33.384
- It's in the air.

53:34.733 --> 53:35.908
Only one thing to do.

53:39.085 --> 53:39.912
Get liquored.

53:44.046 --> 53:47.093
[glasses clinking]

53:47.136 --> 53:48.137
- How many you need?

53:49.356 --> 53:50.575
- [sighing] Two.
- Two.

53:54.535 --> 53:55.362
- One?
- Yeah.

53:56.320 --> 53:57.146
- Shit.

53:59.627 --> 54:01.020
[birds chirping]

54:01.063 --> 54:03.414
You sure you're
okay to fly, Kohler?

54:12.074 --> 54:14.773
[dramatic music]

55:15.703 --> 55:17.183
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

55:25.670 --> 55:28.629
[liquid trickling]

55:29.587 --> 55:31.850
[rustling]

55:38.378 --> 55:39.205
Fuck!

55:46.691 --> 55:47.866
Come on, baby.

55:48.823 --> 55:52.131
[blowing hard]

55:52.174 --> 55:54.351
[panting]

56:09.061 --> 56:12.020
[distorted speech]

57:07.989 --> 57:10.252
[shouting]

57:43.285 --> 57:46.158
[thunder crashing]

57:53.513 --> 57:56.429
[static crackling]

57:57.343 --> 58:01.826
- I'm on with him right now.
I can't tell if he can read
me or not.

58:01.869 --> 58:04.393
Sparks, are you reading me?

58:04.437 --> 58:06.265
Sparks, do you read me?

58:11.836 --> 58:13.968
- Can you read me, over?

58:14.012 --> 58:17.450
- [static crackling], over.

58:17.494 --> 58:18.843
- Say again Donna, over.

58:20.584 --> 58:22.629
- We've been tracking
it. The forecast...
[static crackling]

58:22.673 --> 58:26.459
- Can you please say that,
come again Donna, over.

58:26.503 --> 58:28.330
- The forecast is
saying that it is headed

58:28.374 --> 58:32.857
straight for you, hurricane
confirmed, category three.

58:32.900 --> 58:34.772
We've been tracking it
every hour and it's only

58:34.815 --> 58:36.338
getting nastier, over.

58:36.382 --> 58:37.514
- Copy that, Donna.

58:39.428 --> 58:41.474
Don't worry about
me, we'll talk to you

58:41.518 --> 58:42.780
in the morning, darling.

58:44.042 --> 58:46.044
- I'd better get a status
report in 24 hours.

58:46.087 --> 58:49.351
Or I'm going to worry, over
and out.

58:49.395 --> 58:52.354
[items clattering]

59:00.406 --> 59:01.407
- The fuck is this?

59:04.062 --> 59:05.933
- I'm sorry about this, Jake.

59:05.977 --> 59:07.848
- What's your
fucking problem, huh?

59:07.892 --> 59:09.415
- Did you forget already?

59:10.721 --> 59:15.464
I must have hit you harder
than I thought, huh?

59:16.944 --> 59:18.598
- Sparky, listen to me, I
don't know what you think

59:18.642 --> 59:20.078
you saw but you gotta let me go.

59:20.121 --> 59:23.908
- You came at me with a
goddamn knife, think I saw!

59:26.780 --> 59:27.912
- Jesus Christ.

59:31.437 --> 59:33.874
- You think I did
this to myself, huh?

59:39.445 --> 59:40.838
I am really trying to
give you the benefit

59:40.881 --> 59:41.969
of the doubt here Jake.

59:43.928 --> 59:45.886
- Can't believe you tied me up.

59:45.930 --> 59:47.540
- Like I said, I feel
real bad about it.

59:47.584 --> 59:48.889
- Do you?
- Yeah.

59:49.934 --> 59:51.109
It was for your own good.

59:52.763 --> 59:54.068
You're outta control, bud.

59:55.504 --> 01:00:00.466
I mean, you insult me, you
damage company property,

01:00:01.641 --> 01:00:05.297
you steal load supplies
and you lost the rifle.

01:00:08.953 --> 01:00:11.869
I don't know what you're
smoking or snorting

01:00:11.912 --> 01:00:14.567
but you are not gonna
jeopardize my home here.

01:00:16.438 --> 01:00:19.659
You wanna hurt
somebody or yourself?

01:00:19.703 --> 01:00:22.488
Not on my watch,
not at my lodge!

01:00:29.669 --> 01:00:32.977
Now, again, I'm real
sorry to say it.

01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:36.241
Because of right now,
you are suspended.

01:00:37.677 --> 01:00:40.375
Your place here in the future
is questionable at best.

01:00:41.376 --> 01:00:43.509
Understand, huh?

01:00:51.212 --> 01:00:52.039
Now.

01:00:56.087 --> 01:00:58.480
Nothing's flying in or
out 'til after the storm.

01:00:59.830 --> 01:01:03.529
Kohler was right, calling
for a category three.

01:01:04.704 --> 01:01:06.314
Now I have to batten
down the hatches.

01:01:07.359 --> 01:01:10.754
Unfortunately, I
could use your help.

01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:16.498
I just wanna know
that I can trust you.

01:01:23.767 --> 01:01:25.725
What does that mean?
- It means yes.

01:01:25.769 --> 01:01:26.683
- Yes what?

01:01:27.553 --> 01:01:28.685
- That you can trust me.

01:01:30.208 --> 01:01:32.471
I'll admit, maybe I was a
little bit out of it before

01:01:32.514 --> 01:01:33.559
but I'm okay now.

01:01:35.953 --> 01:01:38.042
I promise you, Sparky,
you can trust me.

01:01:42.829 --> 01:01:44.744
- Jesus Christ, man. Just get
me the fuck out of here.

01:01:44.788 --> 01:01:46.311
I just need a cigarette.

01:02:01.761 --> 01:02:03.197
- I'm gonna untie your hands.

01:02:04.895 --> 01:02:07.593
The rest you can do yourself.

01:02:10.422 --> 01:02:11.249
- Sure.

01:02:25.437 --> 01:02:26.264
- Easy.

01:02:48.852 --> 01:02:50.984
[sighing]

01:02:55.641 --> 01:02:56.468
[engine humming]

01:02:56.511 --> 01:02:57.599
Wanna top it up?

01:02:58.775 --> 01:03:00.124
Goes right down there.

01:03:10.656 --> 01:03:13.920
[soft music box music]

01:03:17.532 --> 01:03:19.143
- You got a bunker?

01:03:20.492 --> 01:03:22.320
- This place is
full of surprises.

01:03:25.279 --> 01:03:27.804
[tense music]

01:03:53.438 --> 01:03:55.832
Spent many a night down here.

01:03:57.050 --> 01:03:59.661
[gulls cawing]

01:04:10.324 --> 01:04:11.325
That's good.

01:04:18.376 --> 01:04:19.681
- Okay, got it.

01:04:24.991 --> 01:04:25.862
- That should do it.

01:04:35.654 --> 01:04:37.003
- You want me to take over?

01:04:39.963 --> 01:04:41.442
- No, I got this.

01:04:45.229 --> 01:04:47.318
- Whatever you say, boss.

01:04:56.066 --> 01:04:58.938
- Marine forecast, hurricane.

01:04:58.982 --> 01:05:02.899
Force wind warning in effect
through Tuesday afternoon.

01:05:02.942 --> 01:05:06.903
West winds 35 to 45 knots,
gusts up to 60 knots.

01:05:06.946 --> 01:05:11.385
After midnight, rain.
[thunder rumbling]

01:05:13.561 --> 01:05:15.694
- It's accelerating quickly.

01:05:15.737 --> 01:05:17.914
Landfall less than an hour.

01:05:17.957 --> 01:05:19.916
We should get underground.

01:05:19.959 --> 01:05:23.006
- Just need to grab something
from my room quickly.

01:05:23.049 --> 01:05:23.920
- Yeah, sure.

01:05:25.269 --> 01:05:29.229
Don't make me come get you.
[thunder rumbling]

01:05:37.542 --> 01:05:40.023
[tense music]

01:05:56.082 --> 01:05:58.693
- Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

01:05:59.651 --> 01:06:02.436
[glass shattering]

01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:04.656
[panting]

01:06:13.447 --> 01:06:16.189
[rain pattering]

01:06:22.282 --> 01:06:23.109
No!

01:06:25.372 --> 01:06:26.852
You can fix this.

01:06:27.984 --> 01:06:30.334
[clattering]

01:06:37.341 --> 01:06:39.647
[creaking]

01:06:52.530 --> 01:06:56.925
[shouting]
[thunder crashing]

01:06:56.969 --> 01:06:59.189
- What'd you do to
yourself now, Jake?

01:06:59.232 --> 01:07:00.059
- Nothing.

01:07:02.757 --> 01:07:05.543
- Those are supposed to
be the emergency supplies.

01:07:05.586 --> 01:07:08.241
- Well, they're being put to
good use then, aren't they?

01:07:10.896 --> 01:07:12.898
- You either have very bad luck

01:07:14.204 --> 01:07:16.641
or you're the stupidest
goddamn idiot I've ever met.

01:07:18.338 --> 01:07:19.557
- I need your opinion

01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:21.167
like I need another
needle in the cock.

01:07:31.047 --> 01:07:32.570
So you never leave here, huh?

01:07:39.142 --> 01:07:40.795
Never wash your fucking clothes?

01:07:42.058 --> 01:07:43.537
Never shower, it's the
same pair of underwear

01:07:43.581 --> 01:07:45.191
for the last four fucking years?

01:07:47.889 --> 01:07:50.283
- Better hygiene than
someone else at this table.

01:07:51.458 --> 01:07:55.375
- Ah, well, nobody to
impress up here, right?

01:07:58.422 --> 01:07:59.727
Is that what you told me?

01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:03.383
Anyway, you'll have to get
some aftershave at least

01:08:03.427 --> 01:08:04.906
when you finally
hook up with Donna.

01:08:04.950 --> 01:08:08.171
- Christ, don't start in on
Donna again.

01:08:09.781 --> 01:08:10.695
- She's a saint.

01:08:13.132 --> 01:08:13.959
- Sure she is.

01:08:19.312 --> 01:08:21.140
- You still wanna play?

01:08:21.184 --> 01:08:22.054
- Hm?

01:08:28.582 --> 01:08:29.930
- Thank for your help today.

01:08:38.505 --> 01:08:40.768
You were really helpful
and I appreciate it.

01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:53.477
[liquid trickling]
Oh.

01:09:08.492 --> 01:09:10.841
Wanna tell me
what's on your mind?

01:09:14.933 --> 01:09:17.240
I've heard it all and then some.

01:09:21.026 --> 01:09:23.028
Why don't you start with
here you found that knife?

01:09:25.899 --> 01:09:26.770
- I wish I could.

01:09:31.428 --> 01:09:33.952
- You know, living up here
puts things in perspective.

01:09:35.736 --> 01:09:38.174
Some people come up
here and the islands

01:09:38.216 --> 01:09:39.305
find the best of them.

01:09:43.395 --> 01:09:45.354
And some, they find the worst.

01:09:55.756 --> 01:09:58.498
Before I came here,

01:10:04.939 --> 01:10:06.550
I worked on big
fishing trawlers.

01:10:08.465 --> 01:10:12.164
We were on this run
in the Bering Strait.

01:10:15.298 --> 01:10:19.084
I was asleep in my
bunk, skeleton crew.

01:10:21.391 --> 01:10:24.481
We were working
double shifts and this

01:10:26.831 --> 01:10:28.920
young deckhand took over watch.

01:10:29.921 --> 01:10:31.314
He was barely into puberty.

01:10:40.061 --> 01:10:43.935
A rouge wave hit us
without warning, a monster.

01:10:47.808 --> 01:10:52.683
All the glass on the bridge
broke and the pressure

01:10:52.726 --> 01:10:56.469
from the water threw this
kid down onto the cabin deck.

01:10:58.428 --> 01:11:00.604
Broke his back and
one of his legs.

01:11:04.390 --> 01:11:05.565
I carried him out.

01:11:14.661 --> 01:11:16.837
[sighing]

01:11:17.882 --> 01:11:19.057
We drifted for 15 hours

01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:21.712
before I realized he'd
stopped breathing.

01:11:30.895 --> 01:11:32.549
Back home I couldn't shake it.

01:11:34.725 --> 01:11:36.944
People always had
something to say or they'd

01:11:37.902 --> 01:11:39.295
just stare at you.

01:11:46.780 --> 01:11:47.912
I needed to get away.

01:11:53.918 --> 01:11:56.224
This place is quiet, peaceful.

01:12:01.229 --> 01:12:02.666
I haven't driven a car in years.

01:12:02.709 --> 01:12:05.799
I can't remember the last
time I was stuck in traffic

01:12:05.843 --> 01:12:09.020
or carried a wallet
around, heard a phone ring.

01:12:16.157 --> 01:12:17.855
And I do not miss
any of that shit.

01:12:22.425 --> 01:12:25.341
[liquid trickling]

01:12:38.223 --> 01:12:40.356
[sighing]

01:12:44.447 --> 01:12:46.710
Devil always gets his due.

01:12:51.367 --> 01:12:53.107
[soft music]

01:12:53.151 --> 01:12:59.897
He may not have got me on
that boat, but when he does,

01:13:01.289 --> 01:13:07.383
I'm gonna be right
here on Haida Gwaii.

01:13:15.521 --> 01:13:17.741
[rustling]

01:13:26.750 --> 01:13:28.099
What you got here?

01:13:31.058 --> 01:13:32.408
Nudie pictures, huh?

01:13:45.116 --> 01:13:46.770
What are these
supposed to be, Jake?

01:13:50.251 --> 01:13:51.862
- You know I had
to get away too.

01:13:55.866 --> 01:13:57.128
Got nothing to go back to.

01:14:01.828 --> 01:14:03.308
Is that what you wanted
to hear, Sparky?

01:14:03.351 --> 01:14:05.876
That everyone I love is
either dead or fucked off

01:14:05.919 --> 01:14:06.920
a long time ago?

01:14:09.967 --> 01:14:11.882
That everything I own
I brought with me here

01:14:11.925 --> 01:14:12.926
on that plane?

01:14:20.543 --> 01:14:22.893
I think about ending it every
fucking goddamn day like it's

01:14:22.936 --> 01:14:23.763
a fucking hobby.

01:14:26.157 --> 01:14:28.072
But I tell myself to
keep going for the work,

01:14:28.115 --> 01:14:28.942
but guess what?

01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:34.600
No one gives a shit about
my work, it's firestarter.

01:14:38.604 --> 01:14:39.475
And now this.

01:14:42.652 --> 01:14:43.957
This is fucking different.

01:14:48.527 --> 01:14:51.443
I need you to listen
to me, Sparky.

01:14:53.663 --> 01:14:55.491
I could have kept this
to myself but I am being

01:14:55.534 --> 01:14:58.406
straight with you here, straight
as a goddamn arrow, okay?

01:15:02.672 --> 01:15:05.239
Shit man, it's like living
in a fucking nightmare.

01:15:09.026 --> 01:15:10.418
- What are you saying, Jake?

01:15:14.727 --> 01:15:18.644
- I'm saying I don't know
how, Sparky, but I know

01:15:18.688 --> 01:15:20.428
you are gonna die.

01:15:22.909 --> 01:15:27.566
[eerie humming]
[thunder crashing]

01:15:27.610 --> 01:15:29.089
What are you talking about--

01:15:29.133 --> 01:15:32.136
- Listen, you leave here,
you're a fucking dead man--

01:15:32.179 --> 01:15:33.659
[thunder crashing]

01:15:33.703 --> 01:15:35.008
- And what if I stay?

01:15:35.052 --> 01:15:36.227
Sparky, don't do this!

01:15:38.229 --> 01:15:39.143
Listen to me, Sparky--

01:15:39.186 --> 01:15:40.840
- Stay the fuck away from me!

01:15:40.884 --> 01:15:42.146
- Sparky, wait.

01:15:42.189 --> 01:15:44.061
- No more Jake, I'm
done with your shit.

01:15:46.019 --> 01:15:47.455
- Listen to me, Sparky!

01:15:47.499 --> 01:15:49.501
Please, okay, you're gonna
die if you go out there.

01:15:51.024 --> 01:15:51.851
Sparky!

01:15:53.070 --> 01:15:55.812
[dramatic music]

01:15:58.423 --> 01:15:59.859
Sparky, Sparky!

01:15:59.903 --> 01:16:01.731
Sparky!

01:16:07.737 --> 01:16:10.783
Sparky!

01:16:10.827 --> 01:16:11.915
Sparky, wait!

01:16:23.056 --> 01:16:23.883

[bear growling]

01:16:37.418 --> 01:16:39.769

01:18:37.756 --> 01:18:38.583
- Jake?

Jake?
