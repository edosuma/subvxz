00:03.503 --> 00:06.438
<i>My mother used</i>
<i>to say this about residency:</i>

00:07.273 --> 00:10.470
<i>It takes a year to learn how to cut.</i>

00:11.211 --> 00:14.612
<i>It takes a lifetime to learn not to.</i>

00:14.647 --> 00:17.343
I'm up. I'm here.
What's going on?

00:17.384 --> 00:21.343
Jackson's BP, it's a little down
from yesterday. No big deal.

00:21.388 --> 00:23.788
But if we make a few calls,
get pushy,

00:23.823 --> 00:27.224
we could get him bumped a few
spots up on the transplant list.

00:27.260 --> 00:31.959
Dr. Bailey, you paged me 911.
At 2:30 in the morning. To chat?

00:34.267 --> 00:38.033
- You like to chat. You're chatty.
- Not at 2:30 in the morning!

00:38.071 --> 00:41.404
Look, he's young,
he's near the top of the list.

00:41.441 --> 00:44.842
UNOS will find him organs when
they find him organs, and God knows,

00:44.878 --> 00:48.041
staying up all night chatting
about it is not gonna help.

00:48.081 --> 00:51.983
Now, I'm going to get some sleep.
I suggest you do the same.

00:52.018 --> 00:53.485
He's running out of time.

00:54.888 --> 00:58.688
They always are.
Welcome to Peds.

00:58.725 --> 01:02.388
<i>Of all of the tools on a surgical tray,</i>

01:02.429 --> 01:06.490
<i>sound judgment</i>
<i>is the trickiest one to master.</i>

01:06.533 --> 01:08.057
<i>And without it,</i>

01:08.101 --> 01:11.264
<i>we're all just toddlers</i>
<i>running around with ten blades.</i>

01:14.908 --> 01:19.538
Ohhh. I asked them not to wake you.
"Whatever it is can wait till morning.

01:19.579 --> 01:23.948
- Dr. Shepherd needs his sleep."
- Your latest head CT shows

01:23.983 --> 01:28.943
the brain contusions expanding. We
need to get you into OR right away.

01:29.722 --> 01:33.624
This... this brain thing,
it could kill me?

01:33.660 --> 01:36.823
If we don't treat it, yes.

01:36.863 --> 01:40.299
- You find that funny.
- I'm sorry, it's just they're gonna

01:40.333 --> 01:43.166
execute me in five days.

01:43.203 --> 01:45.467
Five days.

01:45.505 --> 01:48.997
Might as well take my chances
with this brain thing, right?

01:49.042 --> 01:51.010
- Mr. Dunn...
- You've got to admit,

01:51.044 --> 01:52.272
it's a nice way to go,

01:52.312 --> 01:56.214
plenty of attractive females.

01:57.050 --> 02:00.417
All the Jell-o I could want.
Have you tried the strawberry?

02:00.453 --> 02:04.480
- It'll change your life.
- You're refusing surgery?

02:04.524 --> 02:08.926
Either way, I'm going to die,
Dr. Shepherd.

02:08.961 --> 02:11.020
Might as well do it on your watch.

02:18.838 --> 02:21.272
Why do you have to live
in Meredith's attic?

02:21.307 --> 02:24.674
How am I supposed to sneak out
with that frat party going?

02:24.711 --> 02:27.874
- Don't you kids ever sleep?
- They're cleaning the house

02:27.914 --> 02:29.643
for Dr. Shepherd's mother.

02:33.386 --> 02:34.819
Mrs. Shepherd's coming?

02:36.055 --> 02:38.523
- To Seattle?
- So?

02:38.558 --> 02:41.857
That woman practically raised me,
taught me right from wrong.

02:41.895 --> 02:44.455
If she found out that I was...

02:44.497 --> 02:46.522
...with you, that we were...

02:46.566 --> 02:49.535
You're Meredith Grey's little sister,
forbidden fruit.

02:49.569 --> 02:53.335
You are 25. You're a fetus.

02:53.373 --> 02:55.898
Twenty-four. I skipped third grade.

02:56.709 --> 02:57.869
I feel dirty.

02:58.845 --> 03:01.507
Ten bucks says she tanks
in the first five minutes.

03:01.548 --> 03:03.914
I have faith in Death.

03:03.950 --> 03:07.181
She's holding that bottle of tequila
like it's a life vest.

03:07.220 --> 03:11.884
- Don't listen to them. She'll love you.
- No. Mothers don't love me.

03:11.925 --> 03:14.985
Mothers like bright
and bubbly and happy and...

03:15.028 --> 03:18.361
- Izzie. Mothers love Izzie.
- They do.

03:18.398 --> 03:21.390
- Mothers do love Izzie.
- My mother would've loved you.

03:21.434 --> 03:24.926
Uh, I stashed all the tequila, took
the condoms out of the cookie jar.

03:24.971 --> 03:29.999
I replaced all your trashy magazines
with issues of <i>Annals of Surgery.</i>

03:30.043 --> 03:31.408
- OK?
- OK.

03:31.444 --> 03:34.504
Does it smell musty in here?

03:34.547 --> 03:37.380
My mom's house smells like
peppermint. It's homey.

03:37.417 --> 03:39.510
- My house isn't homey?
- I feel at home.

03:39.552 --> 03:42.385
- This place is a palace.
- Why isn't my house homey?

03:42.422 --> 03:45.585
- It's just a feeling!
- Izzie can't fix a feeling!

03:45.625 --> 03:48.219
She's freaking out.
Tell her something I can fix.

03:48.261 --> 03:51.196
Rebecca peed on that couch cushion.

03:51.231 --> 03:55.292
- I've been sleeping there for weeks.
- Thanks, Alex. You're a good friend.

03:55.335 --> 03:57.826
You're welcome. Keep drinking.

04:05.812 --> 04:07.473
- Mark?
- Hey, there you are.

04:07.513 --> 04:09.242
- Wanna drink?
- It's 4:00 am.

04:09.282 --> 04:11.512
You're right.
I should've called first.

04:11.551 --> 04:15.043
Hey, I hear your mom's coming
into town. Good times.

04:16.422 --> 04:18.481
You'll be fine.

04:18.524 --> 04:22.051
Just keep the talking to a minimum.
Short nuggets of Meredith.

04:22.095 --> 04:25.553
That's all anyone really needs.
If you get stuck, just smile.

04:25.598 --> 04:28.032
You have a really great smile.

04:29.636 --> 04:32.104
That's just scary.

04:32.138 --> 04:35.471
Mer? Are you sure you want
to wear your hair like that?

04:54.427 --> 04:56.793
You're wearing
an alarmingly high ponytail.

04:56.829 --> 04:58.922
Your mother is coming.

05:02.635 --> 05:06.503
Mr. Dunn, the swelling
in your brain is increasing rapidly.

05:06.539 --> 05:10.031
- The longer we wait, the worse it gets.
- Excellent.

05:10.076 --> 05:13.136
- Go, team.
- I suggest you reconsider surgery.

05:13.179 --> 05:15.977
Have you seen the inside
of a maximum-security prison?

05:16.015 --> 05:21.180
Believe me, if you have to die,
this is the place to do it.

05:21.220 --> 05:22.847
In good company.

05:23.923 --> 05:27.484
You two vigilantly monitor
Mr. Dunn's elevating ICP's,

05:27.527 --> 05:31.486
you will do hourly exams. When
he goes unconscious, which he will,

05:31.531 --> 05:35.729
- we'll rush him to surgery.
- You can't do that. Can he do that?

05:35.768 --> 05:39.067
When you're unconscious and can
no longer make decisions,

05:39.105 --> 05:41.835
a two-doctor consent
is needed to treat you.

05:41.874 --> 05:45.105
I'm gonna be dead as a doornail
in five days! Dr. Grey...

05:45.144 --> 05:47.840
- We're done.
- Would you fix a broken television

05:47.880 --> 05:50.314
- before you throw it out?
- He's got a point.

05:50.350 --> 05:53.285
Trying to cheat the system.
We're not gonna let him do it.

05:55.722 --> 05:58.247
- What's the problem?
- I have an infection

05:58.291 --> 06:01.226
- from a little surgery I had done.
- In Hong Kong.

06:01.260 --> 06:06.459
My crazy-ass brother got crazy-ass
elective surgery in Hong Kong.

06:06.499 --> 06:08.933
- Who does that?
- Short people.

06:08.968 --> 06:11.334
Desperate short people!

06:11.371 --> 06:15.239
I had my legs lengthened. I couldn't
find a surgeon who would do it here.

06:15.274 --> 06:18.801
Look, it's barbaric.
They broke his legs,

06:18.845 --> 06:21.973
and they hooked him up
to some medieval torture device.

06:22.014 --> 06:25.973
Yeah, that's to pull the bones apart.
That's the lengthening process.

06:26.018 --> 06:28.782
It's controversial.
I don't perform it myself.

06:28.821 --> 06:30.686
Can I take a look?

06:37.797 --> 06:40.027
They said it'd give me
two whole inches.

06:42.568 --> 06:44.968
- Any word from UNOS?
- Not yet.

06:45.037 --> 06:47.471
Dr. Karev is
in constant contact with them.

06:47.507 --> 06:52.240
How much longer will we wait?
Are livers and intestines hard to find?

06:52.278 --> 06:55.975
Jackson's blood is O positive,
shouldn't be difficult to match.

06:57.550 --> 07:00.747
He's had blood transfusions,
which means there could be

07:00.787 --> 07:05.781
extra antibodies that are hard to
match, so we need patience, Melinda.

07:05.825 --> 07:11.559
In the meantime, I need to run some
tests on Jackson to check electrolytes.

07:11.597 --> 07:15.089
We're gonna do everything we can
to help your son, Mrs. Prescott.

07:15.134 --> 07:16.658
All of us.

07:18.538 --> 07:22.201
- You. You're squirrelly.
- I'm sorry?

07:22.241 --> 07:25.210
I don't trust you.
I don't trust you in this hospital,

07:25.244 --> 07:28.008
and I don't trust you with
my patient of three years

07:28.047 --> 07:29.810
who is extremely important.

07:29.849 --> 07:32.841
- I...
- If you want to stay on this case,

07:32.885 --> 07:36.184
you will stay out of my way,
you will do what I tell you,

07:36.222 --> 07:39.453
and if you have something to say
to or about my patient,

07:39.492 --> 07:43.292
you will raise your hand
and wait to be called on.

07:43.329 --> 07:45.160
You've got to be kidding me.

07:52.672 --> 07:56.108
- Yes?
- This is a joke, right?

07:56.142 --> 07:58.770
Do I look like I'm laughing?

08:02.482 --> 08:05.883
- You're upset.
- I don't get upset with patients.

08:05.918 --> 08:09.513
You're mad at me
for killing those women. I get that.

08:11.023 --> 08:15.289
Would you feel differently
if you knew I was beaten as a child?

08:15.328 --> 08:18.627
Every day.
It's how I learned to read.

08:18.664 --> 08:21.098
I used to hide under the sink

08:21.133 --> 08:24.466
and sound out the letters
on the detergent box.

08:27.840 --> 08:32.174
- Is that true?
- Did it make you feel better?

08:33.913 --> 08:36.677
Whatever helps you sleep
at night, Dr. Grey.

08:38.751 --> 08:40.013
Cool.

08:40.052 --> 08:42.145
Did you do something bad?

08:45.057 --> 08:47.855
Traffic violation.

08:54.100 --> 08:56.398
What's wrong with you, kid?

08:56.435 --> 08:58.562
I need a new liver and a new intestine.

09:00.506 --> 09:02.997
Yeah? You want mine?

09:11.384 --> 09:15.718
Are you in the north terminal?
That's where she's supposed to be.

09:15.755 --> 09:18.553
No. Don't go anywhere, just wait.

09:19.492 --> 09:22.723
I found her. There's a town car
waiting at the airport.

09:22.762 --> 09:26.095
I don't need a fancy car, I hopped
on the bus. Saved you money.

09:26.132 --> 09:29.465
So this cruise... you happened
to have a layover in Seattle?

09:29.502 --> 09:32.164
I've always wanted
to check out the Space Needle.

09:32.204 --> 09:34.934
I understand you can see
Mt. Rainier from the top.

09:34.974 --> 09:37.636
- Anything else?
- Are you gonna take me or not?

09:37.677 --> 09:40.407
I got back-to-back surgeries.
Got to give me notice.

09:40.446 --> 09:43.973
Yeah, I gave birth to five doctors.
I know the drill.

09:44.016 --> 09:49.113
I can wait, maybe meet your
colleagues. Is that Mark Sloan?

09:49.155 --> 09:52.318
- Mark Sloan!
- Mrs. Shepherd. You look great.

09:52.358 --> 09:55.589
Oh, damn. We'll catch up later?

09:55.628 --> 09:57.994
Perfect timing.

09:58.030 --> 10:01.397
- Mom, this is Meredith.
- Meredith! Finally.

10:03.402 --> 10:05.927
- Hi.
- My son's been acting like a dog

10:05.972 --> 10:09.373
with his favorite bone, hiding you.
I hope you're free for lunch.

10:09.408 --> 10:13.071
I can't wait to dive right in
and find out all about you.

10:13.112 --> 10:15.774
Mer looks weird.
Does she look weird to you?

10:15.815 --> 10:19.808
- Like she's gonna pee her pants.
- Crap. I made her hydrate.

10:19.852 --> 10:23.185
Meeting the family always blows.
I'd never make you do that.

10:23.222 --> 10:26.385
Me, either. One of the many perks
of dating a dead guy.

10:30.796 --> 10:34.596
- Who's that lady touching Meredith?
- Derek's mom.

10:34.634 --> 10:38.934
- Huh. That's why she looks so weird.
- She does not look weird.

10:38.971 --> 10:42.270
I've got it under control.
Mer is doing... great.

10:43.776 --> 10:45.971
Looks like she's gonna pee.

10:46.012 --> 10:49.175
Dr. Yang, you mind checking in
on some of my post-ops?

10:49.215 --> 10:52.707
ER's swamped with traumas.
Also, would you like to go on a date?

10:53.352 --> 10:57.152
- I'm sorry?
- A date.

10:57.189 --> 11:00.818
You said not to play hot and cold
with you, so...

11:00.860 --> 11:03.021
...I'll pick you up around eight.

11:04.363 --> 11:07.355
And make sure Mr. Kenner
in room 2212 gets that enema.

11:07.400 --> 11:10.130
He's been holding on to it for days.

11:10.970 --> 11:13.165
OK.

11:13.205 --> 11:15.298
'Cause that wasn't weird.

11:19.879 --> 11:23.474
no awkward dates.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.916
Two to one. But who's counting.

11:27.219 --> 11:31.713
Why can't I have that nice man's
organs? He offered.

11:31.757 --> 11:35.284
You know how in school
there are rules you have to follow?

11:35.327 --> 11:38.854
Same goes for here.
We have to follow the rules,

11:38.898 --> 11:41.264
or else we get in big trouble.

11:41.300 --> 11:45.236
And what that man offered you
is definitely against the rules.

11:46.872 --> 11:49.432
She's fighting with
the insurance people again.

11:49.475 --> 11:52.069
You're not supposed
to worry about stuff like that.

11:53.779 --> 11:56.145
Tell her something good today.

11:56.182 --> 12:01.415
Even if nothing good happens.
She needs good news.

12:02.154 --> 12:07.592
I've got a body full
of high-quality parts here.

12:07.626 --> 12:09.526
Three-day liquidation sale.

12:09.562 --> 12:12.030
Everything must go.

12:12.064 --> 12:14.931
Even if we could do it,
you have to be a match for him.

12:14.967 --> 12:17.765
Which means we have
to cross match your blood with his.

12:17.803 --> 12:20.101
Good thing we're both
in a hospital then.

12:23.576 --> 12:26.977
Let... let me save a life
before I go.

12:28.414 --> 12:31.144
It's the least I can do.

12:33.119 --> 12:37.419
So you really expect me to believe
you want to do this for a kid?

12:40.192 --> 12:43.423
Whatever helps you sleep
at night, Dr. Grey.

12:46.465 --> 12:49.366
The infection's made its way
deep into the bone.

12:49.401 --> 12:51.232
We're gonna take the rods out.

12:51.270 --> 12:53.534
Clean out the infected skin and bone.

12:53.572 --> 12:56.439
I won't get my two inches?
All that pain, for nothing?

12:56.475 --> 13:00.070
Mr. Ruben, at this point,
you're lucky to keep your legs at all.

13:00.112 --> 13:03.843
That's easy for you to say.
What are you, 5'10, 5'11?

13:03.883 --> 13:06.317
- Leave the doctors alone.
- Shut up, Gary.

13:06.352 --> 13:09.253
You are over six feet tall!

13:09.288 --> 13:12.416
Do you have any idea what it's like

13:12.458 --> 13:15.655
to have everybody you know
literally look down on you?

13:15.694 --> 13:19.289
Or how humiliating it is to have
to ask for help from a teenager

13:19.331 --> 13:22.596
at the grocery store
because you can't reach the top shelf?

13:22.635 --> 13:25.604
I've gone on two dates
in the last six months

13:25.638 --> 13:29.301
with women I met over the Internet.
No one wants to see me again.

13:29.341 --> 13:32.310
- No one wants to date the short guy.
- Chuck...

13:33.479 --> 13:37.677
I wanted those two inches, Gary.
I wanted them so bad.

13:37.716 --> 13:42.050
It's two inches. What's the difference
between 5'3"and 5'5"?

13:45.724 --> 13:47.749
5'5" you can say out loud.

13:53.532 --> 13:57.992
OK. I made a list of the best
pediatric Gl's in the country.

13:58.037 --> 14:02.030
We can get one of these guys to come
do a TIPS procedure on him.

14:02.074 --> 14:03.871
On a kid who needs a new liver?

14:03.909 --> 14:06.241
Like putting a Band-Aid
on a bullet wound.

14:06.278 --> 14:09.008
- You have a better idea?
- I do.

14:09.048 --> 14:12.313
Wait for UNOS. Trusting the process.
Why can't you do that?

14:12.351 --> 14:15.377
Because I'm tired of waiting
while this kid gets worse.

14:15.421 --> 14:18.948
Jackson's tired, his mother is.
The only one who's happy to sit

14:18.991 --> 14:20.925
and twiddle her thumbs is you!

14:20.960 --> 14:23.326
I've been patient with you,
I've been nice,

14:23.362 --> 14:27.093
but I am really over you constantly
telling me how to do my job.

14:27.132 --> 14:29.726
- Somebody's got to...
- I have 20 other kids...

14:30.269 --> 14:32.328
Shut up!

14:32.371 --> 14:35.568
Respectfully. Respectfully, shut up.

14:35.608 --> 14:37.235
Because we got organs.

14:43.349 --> 14:47.877
I wish you could get organs delivered
instead of having to go pick them up.

14:47.920 --> 14:52.220
I hate flying. I always feel much closer
to death on a plane than in the OR.

14:52.258 --> 14:55.489
- Don't you?
- I do now.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.788
I met Izzie the other day.

14:58.831 --> 15:00.958
She's very pretty.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.366
So do you think she's the one?

15:03.402 --> 15:04.835
I... I don't know.

15:04.870 --> 15:07.361
Well, we're at that age, right?

15:07.406 --> 15:10.102
Marriage, babies.

15:10.142 --> 15:12.110
- That the plan?
- I don't know!

15:13.245 --> 15:16.271
I'm sorry, I don't make plans, OK?

15:16.315 --> 15:19.443
If there's a future, great. If not,
I'll get over it. I always do.

15:19.485 --> 15:20.543
OK?

15:24.123 --> 15:26.091
OK.

15:26.125 --> 15:29.356
I think it's nice. Your date.

15:29.395 --> 15:31.920
You and the pig murderer
make a good couple.

15:31.964 --> 15:33.864
- OK.
- What are you gonna do?

15:33.899 --> 15:36.265
- What are you gonna talk about?
- You care?

15:36.302 --> 15:39.100
Yeah, why do you care?

15:39.138 --> 15:43.040
You only get to do a first date once.
It should be fun

15:43.075 --> 15:45.407
and sexy and...

15:45.444 --> 15:47.105
Ask really good questions.

15:47.146 --> 15:49.876
Ask him why he first decided
he wanted to save lives.

15:49.915 --> 15:53.009
- Ask him what his best surgery was.
- I know how to go on a date.

15:53.052 --> 15:56.488
Why is Meredith eating pot roast?

15:56.522 --> 15:58.854
It's a show lunch for the mommy.

15:58.891 --> 16:01.951
She's freaking out.
That ponytail is gonna blow.

16:04.196 --> 16:06.858
Derek tells me you
grew up here in Seattle.

16:06.899 --> 16:09.993
- Are your parents...?
- Dead.

16:10.069 --> 16:12.367
Meredith's mother died last year.

16:12.404 --> 16:13.894
Oh.

16:13.939 --> 16:17.534
I'm so sorry. And your father?

16:17.576 --> 16:20.010
Oh. You know,

16:20.045 --> 16:22.275
I should go check on the patient.

16:22.314 --> 16:25.010
Who's the serial killer...

16:25.050 --> 16:26.449
...who's here.

16:26.485 --> 16:28.544
Not killing people.

16:28.587 --> 16:30.214
So that's good.

16:30.255 --> 16:32.723
- I should go.
- Yeah.

16:32.758 --> 16:33.952
OK.

16:37.329 --> 16:40.594
Family isn't her favorite topic, OK?

16:40.632 --> 16:43.726
- She's had a rough time of it.
- I didn't say a word.

16:43.769 --> 16:45.964
I know what you're thinking.

16:48.107 --> 16:52.567
I was thinking...
it must be awful for you.

16:53.712 --> 16:54.906
Treating a murderer.

16:59.785 --> 17:01.912
Dad died a long time ago. I'm fine.

17:04.623 --> 17:08.582
- What are you doing?
- Sleep with me, you lunch with me.

17:08.627 --> 17:11.755
- New rule.
- You let interns sit with you?

17:11.797 --> 17:15.756
- That's so cool.
- Wanna go halfsies on that cookie?

17:15.800 --> 17:17.962
What are you gonna trade me for it?

17:18.002 --> 17:19.664
You guys, they have Tater Tots!

17:22.074 --> 17:24.133
I have to go.

17:27.613 --> 17:30.480
- Mark?
- Mrs. Shepherd.

17:30.516 --> 17:32.780
- You've been avoiding me.
- What? No.

17:32.818 --> 17:36.345
You have the same look on your face
as you did when you were ten

17:36.388 --> 17:39.084
and put Derek's favorite frog
in the microwave.

17:39.124 --> 17:43.493
- I never pressed start.
- What's going on?

17:45.964 --> 17:47.761
I'm sleeping with her.

17:49.501 --> 17:53.631
- Oh, Mark, not again! How could you?
- No... No.

17:53.672 --> 17:55.663
Not Meredith. God, no.

17:56.909 --> 17:59.400
Meredith's little sister.

18:00.679 --> 18:02.613
Which one is she?

18:02.648 --> 18:05.173
The... one with the juice box.

18:10.389 --> 18:12.983
- Are my new organs here yet?
- Not yet.

18:13.025 --> 18:15.516
But we're gonna get you
all prepped now

18:15.561 --> 18:18.052
so we can put them in
as soon as they get here.

18:18.097 --> 18:21.760
When you wake up, you'll be a
brand-new boy with brand-new parts.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.927
I can't believe this is it.

18:23.969 --> 18:28.429
The thought of us getting to live
our lives outside this hospital...

18:28.474 --> 18:32.706
- Don't get me wrong, I love our chats.
- But it'll be nice not to see my face.

18:32.744 --> 18:34.575
So freaking nice!

18:46.758 --> 18:50.353
- It's just a kid.
- Yep. Let's go get his organs.

18:56.001 --> 19:00.267
Am I hallucinating
or is that a really high ponytail?

19:01.140 --> 19:03.199
You're not hallucinating.

19:03.242 --> 19:06.905
But once your brain starts to herniate,
I can't promise anything.

19:06.945 --> 19:10.676
So I'm really circling the drain here?

19:10.716 --> 19:14.049
You should just take my organs
right now. Help that poor kid.

19:14.086 --> 19:17.180
They found him organs.
They're flying them over right now.

19:17.222 --> 19:18.780
He's going to be fine.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.163
Did you know
that they let you choose?

19:32.905 --> 19:37.672
Hanging or lethal.
You get to pick your poison.

19:37.709 --> 19:38.869
Literally.

19:41.480 --> 19:43.710
Which one would you choose?

19:45.918 --> 19:47.943
Medically speaking, which one's...

19:49.254 --> 19:50.619
...better?

19:54.860 --> 19:57.055
Well, with hanging,

19:57.095 --> 19:59.825
your neck breaks,
which severs your spinal cord,

19:59.865 --> 20:04.427
which causes blood pressure to drop,
and you lose consciousness.

20:04.469 --> 20:07.302
You don't actually die
for several minutes.

20:07.339 --> 20:09.500
And with lethal injection,

20:09.541 --> 20:13.875
they inject an anesthetic first
which puts you to sleep,

20:13.912 --> 20:17.746
and then a paralytic which
stops your diaphragm and lungs.

20:17.783 --> 20:20.843
And then potassium,
which stops your heart.

20:29.595 --> 20:34.259
Was... was I a match?

20:37.169 --> 20:38.761
Yes, you were.

21:03.228 --> 21:07.130
Can I help you with something?
Were you looking for Dr. Shep...?

21:07.165 --> 21:10.965
- Are you a good girl?
- I... What?

21:11.003 --> 21:15.235
A good girl. I don't mean perfect,
I mean... relatively speaking.

21:16.942 --> 21:18.500
- Are you?
- Yes.

21:20.112 --> 21:23.104
How many sexual partners
have you had? I won't judge.

21:23.148 --> 21:25.946
Um, six. No, s-seven.

21:25.984 --> 21:28.544
Kinda six, kinda seven.

21:28.587 --> 21:30.612
- Criminal record?
- Speeding ticket.

21:30.656 --> 21:32.283
- How fast?
- Twelve miles over.

21:32.324 --> 21:36.761
- That's fast.
- It isn't too... Way too fast.

21:36.795 --> 21:40.196
But it was downhill.
I was coasting, ma'am.

21:41.967 --> 21:43.764
I don't suppose you can tell me...

21:46.571 --> 21:48.539
...where the gift shop is?

21:49.875 --> 21:51.604
First floor, east wing.

21:59.985 --> 22:04.046
- It's like pudding in here.
- It's why I don't do this procedure.

22:04.089 --> 22:09.117
You're living with broken legs for
months, you're in excruciating pain.

22:09.161 --> 22:11.459
All for a few inches.

22:11.496 --> 22:15.364
Pain and agony for a little
bit of pleasure. I get it.

22:15.400 --> 22:18.369
If it's that bad,
why don't you just stop sleep...

22:20.505 --> 22:24.441
- ...doing what you're doing?
- It doesn't feel bad when I'm...

22:24.476 --> 22:27.968
...doing it. It's good. It's great.

22:28.013 --> 22:33.076
And maybe if you weren't so scared
of getting burned you'd feel the same.

22:35.387 --> 22:38.288
I used to walk tall around here.

22:38.323 --> 22:40.951
I used to walk tall.

22:40.992 --> 22:43.859
Then came George.

22:43.895 --> 22:46.887
He took off at least an inch.

22:46.932 --> 22:50.766
And Erica went and left me.
That shaved off a few more.

22:50.802 --> 22:52.497
I got shorter.

22:52.537 --> 22:56.906
All that humiliation makes you shorter.
So, yeah, I am scared of getting hurt.

22:56.942 --> 23:00.378
One more personal disaster right now
would cut me off at the knees.

23:08.086 --> 23:10.418
So Valentine's Day.

23:10.455 --> 23:13.390
Personally, I think you
can't go wrong with jewelry.

23:13.425 --> 23:17.122
- I could recommend some places.
- What is wrong with you?

23:17.162 --> 23:20.359
- What?
- We just took a liver and intestine

23:20.399 --> 23:22.731
from a little kid.
A dead little kid.

23:22.768 --> 23:24.429
And you don't even care.

23:24.469 --> 23:28.735
You're talking about rainbows
and relationships and crap.

23:28.774 --> 23:30.571
What the hell is wrong with you?

23:34.646 --> 23:39.049
You don't think I know they just
pulled the plug on a kid?

23:39.084 --> 23:41.712
You don't think I get that?

23:42.687 --> 23:47.522
You don't think I know about the tiny,
tiny coffin they're gonna stick him in?

23:47.559 --> 23:49.618
I know about the tiny coffins.

23:49.661 --> 23:53.654
I see them all the time.
In my sleep.

23:53.698 --> 23:56.792
So if you don't mind,
I'm gonna keep talking

23:56.835 --> 24:00.066
relationships and rainbows and crap,

24:00.105 --> 24:03.632
and I'm gonna make plans
for tomorrow.

24:03.675 --> 24:08.044
Because that's what you do, Karev.
You make plans.

24:09.114 --> 24:14.746
You have to. You turn your back
on the tiny coffins and face forward.

24:16.288 --> 24:17.687
To the next kid.

24:24.362 --> 24:26.922
- How's our death-row guy?
- Pissing me off.

24:26.965 --> 24:29.763
Blossoming brain contusions,
refusing surgery.

24:29.801 --> 24:33.635
- Thinks he'll get a stay of execution?
- No, he'd like to die here.

24:33.672 --> 24:36.004
He wants to control it.
He wants to choose.

24:36.041 --> 24:38.669
I went overboard buying bears
for your nieces.

24:38.710 --> 24:40.871
- Mom, this is Major Owen Hunt.
- Major?

24:40.912 --> 24:44.143
I was a Navy nurse for 25 years.
Where were you stationed?

24:44.182 --> 24:46.707
- In the thick of it. In Iraq.
- Welcome home.

24:46.751 --> 24:51.347
- You must have stories.
- Not any worth telling, ma'am.

24:55.560 --> 24:59.121
- I finished your post-ops.
- Thank you, Dr. Yang.

25:05.537 --> 25:08.836
- What was your best surgery ever?
- What?

25:08.874 --> 25:11.308
Nothing. Uh, stupid.

25:13.545 --> 25:16.412
- Finishing the vena cava.
- Anastomosis looks good.

25:16.448 --> 25:19.076
All that's left
is to release the clamps.

25:19.117 --> 25:23.383
You should do the honors, Miranda.
He's your patient.

25:26.458 --> 25:28.790
Thank you, Dr. Robbins.

25:41.873 --> 25:43.841
Call on me.

25:46.244 --> 25:47.438
Call on me.

25:48.547 --> 25:49.741
Call on me!

25:52.284 --> 25:54.752
There's a spot on the duodenum.

25:55.987 --> 25:58.421
What the hell is that?

25:58.456 --> 26:01.357
- I don't feel good.
- ICP is critical. We can't wait.

26:01.393 --> 26:04.362
- We have to get him down to the OR.
- No. No.

26:04.396 --> 26:08.298
- We have to get you to surgery.
- I'm not scared of dying.

26:08.333 --> 26:13.635
I just don't want to do it strapped
down on a table like some animal.

26:14.906 --> 26:17.306
Please... Please, Dr. Grey.

26:18.977 --> 26:20.308
Let me go.

26:28.353 --> 26:29.684
OK, start bagging him.

26:29.721 --> 26:32.349
- Intubate, get him into the OR.
- Yeah, right here.

26:32.390 --> 26:35.518
I need another doctor's signature,
consent to operate.

26:36.428 --> 26:37.554
Meredith, sign.

26:38.830 --> 26:39.888
Sign the form.

26:41.466 --> 26:42.933
Meredith, sign the form!

26:45.070 --> 26:46.662
Meredith, sign the form!

26:50.542 --> 26:52.908
Yang, you're scrubbing in.

27:01.052 --> 27:04.488
He's clotting and clotting and clotting.
Is there a source?

27:04.522 --> 27:08.117
This can't be happening.
Not to this little boy.

27:08.159 --> 27:11.026
- This is not happening...
- These organs are dead.

27:11.062 --> 27:14.122
They're making him sicker.
Keeping them in is doing harm.

27:14.165 --> 27:17.498
- He will die if you leave them in.
- He'll die if we take them out!

27:17.535 --> 27:19.025
Pressure's dropping.

27:20.705 --> 27:24.072
Try a portacaval shunt.
It'll bypass the liver.

27:24.109 --> 27:26.976
- That's a temporary fix.
- Got any better ideas?

27:28.546 --> 27:32.642
- I don't see what choice we have.
- How much time to find new organs?

27:32.684 --> 27:35.244
Twenty-four hours.

27:35.286 --> 27:37.880
Get some more laps in here too.

27:39.524 --> 27:43.585
We're going to put this piece of skull
in Mr. Dunn's abdomen. Why?

27:43.628 --> 27:46.222
To allow the swelling
in the brain to resolve.

27:46.264 --> 27:50.132
Circulation of abdomen preserves
the bone marrow in the skull piece.

27:50.168 --> 27:53.331
- Very good.
- Thanks for letting me scrub in.

27:53.371 --> 27:57.034
I guess we finally
see eye to eye on something.

28:01.413 --> 28:03.745
Are we ever gonna find out
why it clotted off?

28:03.782 --> 28:06.979
Sometimes the body,
the pieces just break.

28:08.053 --> 28:12.717
- I'm like that.
- Yeah? You dying for no reason?

28:14.559 --> 28:19.587
My life is in pieces, all of the time.

28:19.631 --> 28:23.931
And they keep breaking, and as soon
as I fix one, another one goes down.

28:24.602 --> 28:29.062
I'm not trying to piss you off.
I'm just trying to keep it together.

28:29.107 --> 28:30.768
Piece by piece.

28:57.702 --> 29:01.536
That ponytail... looks ridiculous.

29:16.855 --> 29:20.586
- She's a lovely girl.
- A lovely girl who's off-limits.

29:20.625 --> 29:23.822
Baloney.
She isn't the problem, you are.

29:23.862 --> 29:27.161
You have very low expectations
for yourself, Mark Sloan.

29:27.198 --> 29:30.793
Since you were a little boy.
And it's time to raise them.

29:30.835 --> 29:32.496
She's 24.

29:32.537 --> 29:37.406
You have the emotional maturity of
a horny 15 year old. You need young.

29:37.442 --> 29:39.467
Mm.

29:40.245 --> 29:44.841
We had to shave off a quarter inch
of leg bone in order to save the legs.

29:46.818 --> 29:48.217
You mean I'm shorter?

29:48.253 --> 29:50.153
I'm a quarter of an inch shorter?

29:50.188 --> 29:52.088
Quarter inch. It's not a big deal.

29:53.958 --> 29:58.019
Yeah. I'm under 5'3".

29:58.062 --> 30:00.963
I am 5'2" and three quarters.

30:00.999 --> 30:04.594
But maybe I can still just squeeze
over the height requirement

30:04.636 --> 30:07.298
- at the amusement park.
- Do you know

30:07.338 --> 30:09.431
why I never played varsity basketball?

30:11.442 --> 30:14.969
- You didn't make the team?
- No. I didn't try out for the team.

30:15.013 --> 30:19.040
I didn't want to make you feel bad
for being too short to play.

30:19.083 --> 30:22.246
Even now, if I have a bad day,
I can't talk to my brother

30:22.287 --> 30:25.188
because maybe you had a bad day
and you're short!

30:25.223 --> 30:28.989
I couldn't even be depressed
about Lori leaving me

30:29.027 --> 30:31.996
because you don't have a girlfriend
and you're short!

30:32.030 --> 30:34.760
By the way, the reason
you don't have a girlfriend

30:34.799 --> 30:37.700
isn't because you're short.
It's because all you do

30:37.735 --> 30:40.033
is talk about being short!

30:42.407 --> 30:45.535
No one knows how short you
are except for you, dude.

30:45.577 --> 30:47.374
No one cares.

30:54.452 --> 30:57.717
- I'm an ass, aren't I?
- Yeah.

30:59.324 --> 31:01.485
And you're short.

31:05.263 --> 31:07.527
Good night. Nice to meet you.

31:07.565 --> 31:10.500
Major Hunt?
How have you been sleeping?

31:10.535 --> 31:13.026
- I'm sorry?
- When I can't sleep,

31:13.071 --> 31:14.470
I use Valerian root.

31:14.505 --> 31:18.032
I know you doctors don't think much
of herbs, but I find it helps.

31:18.076 --> 31:21.705
Have you been sleeping?
Since you came back?

31:23.715 --> 31:27.776
I'm fine, ma'am. I... sleep just fine.

31:28.987 --> 31:31.012
Good night.

31:33.925 --> 31:38.419
- How's your head feel, Mr. Dunn?
- Why didn't you just let me go?

31:38.463 --> 31:42.160
- You're not dying here.
- What are you so scared of?

31:42.200 --> 31:45.966
- Losing control?
- ICP's stable. Continue neuro exams.

31:46.004 --> 31:49.701
Keep an eye on his blood pressure.
I don't want it dropping.

31:49.741 --> 31:53.802
Or maybe you know deep down,
you're no better than I am.

31:53.845 --> 31:56.541
You decide who lives
and dies all the time.

31:56.581 --> 32:00.483
For you, they call it medicine,
not a capital offense.

32:00.518 --> 32:05.751
Nobody gets to choose.
Not me, not a patient in this hospital

32:05.790 --> 32:08.384
and certainly not the women
you slaughtered.

32:08.426 --> 32:11.293
So when I say you're
not gonna die in this hospital,

32:11.329 --> 32:17.199
I mean there is no way in hell
I will let you die in this hospital.

32:19.504 --> 32:21.438
You don't get off that easy.

32:23.641 --> 32:25.438
I'm nothing like you.

32:34.052 --> 32:35.280
Meredith.

32:35.320 --> 32:38.949
I was just looking for Derek.
I thought you'd be with him.

32:42.493 --> 32:45.155
You seem like a very nice person.

32:45.196 --> 32:48.688
You've been kind
and you've given me a chance.

32:48.733 --> 32:51.668
It seems like you want to like me.

32:53.104 --> 32:56.767
So it's only fair you should know...

32:56.808 --> 33:00.505
...the pink and the ponytail
and the smiling with the teeth?

33:01.512 --> 33:03.707
I'm a fraud. It's fake.

33:03.748 --> 33:07.479
I'm not the kind of girl mothers like.
I'm not happy and bubbly.

33:07.518 --> 33:09.884
I'm dark and cloudy,

33:09.921 --> 33:13.448
because I'm the type
of crazy person who...

33:13.491 --> 33:16.460
...feels bad for serial killers.

33:20.932 --> 33:23.594
It was very nice to meet you, Meredith.

33:47.492 --> 33:48.754
What's wrong?

33:50.061 --> 33:53.087
- I want to meet your mother.
- Iz.

33:53.131 --> 33:57.363
I want to go on a date with you.
I want to eat dinner in a restaurant

33:57.402 --> 34:00.769
and not look like
a crazy person talking to myself.

34:00.805 --> 34:04.832
I want to walk down the street
with you and hold your hand.

34:04.876 --> 34:08.039
I want to tell my friends about you
and I want...

34:09.414 --> 34:11.210
I want...

34:12.350 --> 34:16.514
- What?
- I want you alive.

34:26.164 --> 34:29.327
Are you breaking up with me,
Izzie Stevens?

34:31.235 --> 34:32.793
I think I am.

34:40.277 --> 34:43.110
- So you wanna get a drink?
- I would, but I have plans.

34:44.081 --> 34:45.514
Right.

34:48.652 --> 34:51.952
- Walk tall.
- What?

34:54.358 --> 34:57.293
All you can do is be brave enough
to get out there.

34:57.328 --> 35:00.422
You fought. You loved.

35:00.465 --> 35:01.830
You lost.

35:03.334 --> 35:05.325
Walk tall, Torres.

35:13.344 --> 35:16.245
You're late. Really late.
They closed the kitchen.

35:16.280 --> 35:18.976
I didn't want you to think
I stood you up.

35:21.285 --> 35:23.446
Are you drunk?

35:26.791 --> 35:31.285
I haven't been on a date in five years,
since before I entered the military.

35:31.329 --> 35:34.230
- I wanted to take the edge off.
- You're late and drunk?

35:34.265 --> 35:37.860
I will make this up to you. I promise.
This is not what you deserve.

35:37.902 --> 35:41.702
This is not what you deserve.
I will make this up to you. I promise.

35:41.739 --> 35:44.833
Before you say anything else,
Dr. Goodtimes, shower.

35:44.876 --> 35:46.400
You smell like a distillery.

35:50.882 --> 35:52.816
No. Not here! I...

35:54.619 --> 35:59.647
Your father always wanted you
to have this for the right girl.

36:01.392 --> 36:03.587
Addy wasn't right, clearly.

36:08.432 --> 36:10.662
You spent less than an hour
with Meredith.

36:12.904 --> 36:17.034
- You barely even know her.
- I know enough.

36:17.074 --> 36:22.444
I know it's easier to have compassion
for a good person than a murderer.

36:23.447 --> 36:25.938
I know how angry
you still are about Dad.

36:25.983 --> 36:28.679
Of course I'm angry.

36:29.820 --> 36:31.685
Aren't you?

36:35.293 --> 36:38.490
I still can't sleep
on his side of the bed,

36:38.529 --> 36:42.693
the mattress is wearing unevenly,

36:42.733 --> 36:44.792
but no.

36:45.670 --> 36:48.002
No, not angry. Not anymore.

36:51.242 --> 36:53.210
Sweetheart...

36:55.313 --> 36:58.407
- You see things in black and white.
- Mm.

36:58.449 --> 37:00.747
Meredith doesn't.

37:00.785 --> 37:04.016
You need a spoonful of that.

37:04.055 --> 37:05.647
You need her.

37:09.327 --> 37:11.192
- She's the one.
- Yeah.

37:19.270 --> 37:21.898
Yang! Yang!

37:24.976 --> 37:29.242
- I thought of my best surgery.
- You're wearing shoes in my shower.

37:29.280 --> 37:32.443
First blast injury in the field.
Body was mangled.

37:32.483 --> 37:37.352
Homemade explosive device, wires
embedded five inches in the abdomen.

37:37.388 --> 37:41.347
Arms and legs hanging on by threads
of skin. Never seen anything like it.

37:41.392 --> 37:46.125
Not in a textbook, not in residency.
Incredible. Body full of holes.

37:46.163 --> 37:49.997
Trauma surgeon's dream.
I put tourniquets on where I could,

37:50.034 --> 37:53.993
started tying off arteries with my bare
hands, but bleeding was everywhere:

37:54.038 --> 37:56.268
stomach, chest...

37:56.307 --> 37:59.538
Best pressure
I could think of was my own body.

37:59.577 --> 38:03.172
I laid there for two hours
on top of him, not moving,

38:03.214 --> 38:08.777
trying to keep that dam from bursting
with my hands, knees, elbows.

38:10.221 --> 38:13.122
Body... full of holes,

38:13.157 --> 38:15.591
and... he never bled out.

38:15.626 --> 38:17.992
I wouldn't let him.

38:18.996 --> 38:23.160
He made it to the hospital, home.
A month later, he sent me a letter

38:23.200 --> 38:26.067
thanking me for saving his life.
Then he shot himself.

38:34.945 --> 38:37.243
That was my best surgery.

38:41.252 --> 38:43.743
And my worst.

38:46.424 --> 38:48.722
<i>We're human.</i>

38:48.759 --> 38:51.091
<i>We make mistakes.</i>

38:53.998 --> 38:56.262
We <i>misestimate.</i>

38:59.837 --> 39:01.828
<i>We call it wrong.</i>

39:16.587 --> 39:19.784
<i>But when a surgeon makes</i>
<i>a bad judgment call,</i>

39:19.824 --> 39:22.054
<i>it's not as simple.</i>

39:22.093 --> 39:25.995
So I checked and we have
a few vacation days coming up.

39:26.030 --> 39:30.797
Maybe we could take a road trip,
stop in Iowa, see some corn.

39:30.835 --> 39:33.201
- Doesn't your mom live in Iowa?
- Yeah.

39:33.237 --> 39:35.034
I think she'd like to meet you.

39:40.177 --> 39:44.477
Or not. Bad idea. Forget it.

39:51.355 --> 39:55.416
There's a bottle of tequila in the
laundry room that has our name on it.

39:55.459 --> 39:57.393
Don't move.

40:11.041 --> 40:12.406
Alex...

40:14.678 --> 40:16.373
We gotta talk.

40:21.585 --> 40:23.712
<i>People get hurt.</i>

40:23.754 --> 40:25.449
<i>They bleed.</i>

40:25.489 --> 40:28.549
I'm so sorry, I just heard.
What happens now?

40:28.592 --> 40:31.288
Now, we wait for a miracle.

40:35.833 --> 40:39.826
<i>So we struggle over every stitch,</i>

40:39.870 --> 40:42.134
<i>we agonize...</i>

40:45.009 --> 40:47.910
<i>...over every suture.</i>

40:52.950 --> 40:57.114
During surgery, Dr. Shepherd
removed a piece of your skull.

40:57.154 --> 41:00.123
Which means your brain is
only covered by dura mater.

41:00.157 --> 41:05.254
It's virtually exposed. If somehow
that area were to be damaged,

41:05.296 --> 41:09.596
it would cause intracranial bleeding,
which could cause your brain to swell

41:09.633 --> 41:13.660
worse than it did today,
which would result in brain death.

41:15.306 --> 41:20.107
So, as your doctor, I need you to be
very careful not to damage it.

41:21.345 --> 41:23.540
Do you understand what I'm saying?

41:33.357 --> 41:35.052
Dr. Grey?

41:37.261 --> 41:40.822
Are you doing this for the kid...

41:40.865 --> 41:42.332
...or for me?

41:42.366 --> 41:44.596
<i>Because the snap judgments,</i>

41:44.635 --> 41:48.867
<i>the ones that come to us quickly</i>
<i>and easily, without hesitation...</i>

41:48.906 --> 41:51.136
Whatever helps you sleep at night.

41:51.175 --> 41:54.269
<i>...they're the ones</i>
<i>that haunt us forever.</i>
