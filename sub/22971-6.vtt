01:01.895 --> 01:06.733
Boy, that stunk. That director's
gonna have a short career.

01:41.893 --> 01:44.062
My stupid alarm.

01:46.105 --> 01:48.858
Ah! My stupid alarm!

01:48.942 --> 01:50.693
I love you! I love you!

01:50.777 --> 01:52.153
Cold, cold, cold!

01:52.237 --> 01:54.405
I love cold water!

01:54.489 --> 01:57.784
I love hot water even more!

02:00.411 --> 02:01.454
Mom.

02:02.956 --> 02:05.834
Ugh. Did I put salt in instead of sugar?

02:07.460 --> 02:11.172
Well, good morning, kiddo.
Yeah, you may not want to eat that.

02:11.256 --> 02:13.341
Mm...

02:13.424 --> 02:14.926
Tastes like home.

02:15.510 --> 02:19.722
- Don't change a thing.
- You're chipper this morning.

02:19.806 --> 02:22.267
Yeah, well, better
chipper than dead, huh?

02:22.767 --> 02:25.270
That's true, I guess.

02:25.353 --> 02:28.731
- Everything okay?
- Are you kidding? Everything is great!

02:29.399 --> 02:33.403
It's back to normal.
It feels good to be back!

02:34.070 --> 02:36.364
Back? Back from where? Ooh!

02:36.531 --> 02:37.740
Definitely salt.

02:37.824 --> 02:40.285
Ah...

02:41.703 --> 02:45.248
- Have you talked to him about it?
- No, it has to come from you.

02:45.331 --> 02:48.501
- Why haven't you talked to him yet?
- He just got out of the Darklands.

02:48.585 --> 02:51.504
- He needs time to recover.
- Whoo!

02:51.588 --> 02:54.591
Check this ou...

02:54.674 --> 02:57.844
Seems fine to me.

02:59.095 --> 03:01.055
Come on, slowpokes,
let's take the old shortcut!

03:02.974 --> 03:05.977
Well, uh, since you've been gone,
Claire found a faster way.

03:06.060 --> 03:08.396
Pssh! Come on. Faster than the canals?

03:11.065 --> 03:12.734
Whoo-hoo!

03:15.111 --> 03:17.405
You're right.
You have gotten good at that.

03:17.488 --> 03:20.366
Good ol' Arcadia Oaks High!

03:20.450 --> 03:22.994
- I wonder what we'll learn today.
- He's clearly not fine.

03:23.077 --> 03:24.996
Who in their right mind
looks forward to school?

03:25.663 --> 03:28.333
I mean, have you seen
how tight Hank's jeans are?

03:31.169 --> 03:33.004
What the...?

03:33.087 --> 03:36.257
Jim! You're back! Oh! You're alive!

03:36.341 --> 03:37.967
"Back"? They know?

03:38.051 --> 03:40.303
They know you're the first person
to be officially cured

03:40.386 --> 03:42.472
from the incurable Jim Lake Disease.

03:42.555 --> 03:43.598
Oh...

03:43.681 --> 03:46.768
- Jim, you're a walking medical mystery.
- What?

03:46.851 --> 03:48.311
Uh...

03:48.394 --> 03:51.022
Yep, could still be contagious.
Move along, Eli.

03:51.105 --> 03:54.442
Bye, Jim! Gonna wash my hands now.

03:54.525 --> 03:57.362
T.P. covered for you
while you were gone, but...

03:57.445 --> 04:00.823
Oh, duh! Toby Pie.

04:00.907 --> 04:03.743
- Guess you missed that one, too.
- Mm... You missed a lot, dude!

04:03.826 --> 04:07.038
I had to pretend to be you. I had to eat
your mom's spaghetti carbonara.

04:07.121 --> 04:10.416
More like "cardboard-nara." You owe me!

04:11.376 --> 04:14.003
You also missed two weeks of homework.
Don't hate us.

04:14.087 --> 04:19.216
Hate you? Are you kidding?
I love homework!

04:19.300 --> 04:22.887
Hm, let's see.
I have Spanish, social studies...

04:22.971 --> 04:26.015
- Ugh, algebra.
- Look who's back!

04:26.432 --> 04:28.726
Did I hear you say you love homework?

04:29.310 --> 04:32.730
There's something fishy
going on in this lake.

04:33.231 --> 04:36.192
- Ahh!
- I even missed you.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.444
- The ol' Palchuk.
- What?

04:38.528 --> 04:40.863
...I'm the most popular,
but you didn't hear that from me.

04:40.947 --> 04:43.950
Fever of 104! I mean, do germs
not know how fabulous I am?

04:47.120 --> 04:51.541
- Ugh! Get your germs off of me!
- Uh, I'll let you two catch up.

04:51.624 --> 04:54.794
It's time for some unfinished business.

04:55.712 --> 04:58.089
Flowers for my flower.

04:58.172 --> 04:59.173
Oh...

04:59.257 --> 05:01.009
How... How sweet.

05:01.718 --> 05:03.678
Not as sweet as you, Queen Darci.

05:03.761 --> 05:06.514
I just wanted to let you know,
some things have calmed down in my life,

05:06.597 --> 05:08.850
and now you have my undivided attention.

05:08.933 --> 05:11.060
That's nice, but...

05:11.144 --> 05:13.646
- Oh, don't say "but." Please don't say...
- But...

05:13.730 --> 05:15.732
...you don't even know
anything about me.

05:18.109 --> 05:19.986
- I'm allergic to flowers.
- Oh.

05:20.069 --> 05:21.738
First, you really like me.

05:21.821 --> 05:23.948
Then, I hardly see you.

05:24.032 --> 05:26.451
- Can't we take it slow?
- How slow?

05:26.534 --> 05:28.619
Like... glacial?

05:31.039 --> 05:34.751
You're cute, T.P.,
but you gotta work on your timing.

05:39.130 --> 05:43.051
Things are all back to the way they
were. Ha! It's like I never left!

05:43.134 --> 05:46.971
Yep, back to square one.
How great for us.

05:48.306 --> 05:54.228
Home is the same, school is the same,
Trollmarket is the same.

05:55.480 --> 05:58.483
Except for that guy.
What's that guy doing here?

05:58.566 --> 06:00.068
Stinking, horrible traitor!

06:00.151 --> 06:01.235
Oh, no.

06:02.779 --> 06:05.281
Another one. Ugh! Away with you!

06:05.365 --> 06:06.491
- Blinky?
- What are you doing?

06:06.574 --> 06:09.452
You love your books!
This isn't like you!

06:09.535 --> 06:10.536
Not my books!

06:10.620 --> 06:13.331
I'm destroying any that bear
my traitorous brother's name.

06:13.831 --> 06:15.291
Full of lies!

06:15.374 --> 06:18.795
My Gumm-Gumm brother cannot be trusted
and neither can these!

06:18.878 --> 06:19.879
Blink!

06:20.713 --> 06:24.967
But they've been useful before,
so they can be useful again.

06:25.051 --> 06:28.012
Aren't you gonna stop him, wingman?

06:28.096 --> 06:30.932
- Uh, what's with Aaarrrgghh!!!?
- Leave him.

06:31.015 --> 06:32.308
Since he's returned from death,

06:32.391 --> 06:34.644
his sense of smell
has been curiously heightened.

06:34.727 --> 06:37.480
- He's been sniffing everything for hours.
- Mm...

06:37.563 --> 06:39.107
You had Italian.

06:39.190 --> 06:41.067
Carbonara.

06:41.859 --> 06:44.737
Yeah, like, three days ago.

06:44.821 --> 06:46.781
Meh, needed more garlic.

06:52.203 --> 06:53.454
Talk to Jim yet?

06:54.288 --> 06:57.041
He says he hasn't found the right time.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.418
It's not just me, right?

06:59.502 --> 07:02.880
Ever since he got back,
he's been acting super weird.

07:02.964 --> 07:05.633
Hey, guys, you know what we need?
A calling!

07:05.716 --> 07:07.468
I'm sure there's been
tons of stuff piling up

07:07.552 --> 07:09.262
for us to take care of
now that I'm back.

07:09.345 --> 07:11.097
- Uh, a cursed box?
- Away with you!

07:11.180 --> 07:13.349
Or a loose monster troll, huh?

07:13.433 --> 07:17.562
Actually, Claire and I kinda took care
of that stuff while you were gone.

07:17.645 --> 07:19.230
Oh, okay.

07:19.313 --> 07:22.817
What about some training? It'd be good
for us to get back in the Forge and...

07:22.900 --> 07:24.402
You know?

07:24.485 --> 07:26.863
I smell Usurna.

07:26.946 --> 07:28.698
Oh, dear.

07:34.579 --> 07:36.706
You... Oh!

07:38.416 --> 07:40.460
So... it's true.

07:41.461 --> 07:45.882
The human Trollhunter has returned
from his frolic in the Darklands.

07:46.632 --> 07:48.759
The human Trollhunter humbly apologizes

07:48.843 --> 07:51.512
and throws himself
at the mercy of the Troll Tribunal.

07:51.596 --> 07:52.638
Tribunal?

07:52.722 --> 07:55.516
The Tribunal has already voted
on your fate.

07:56.142 --> 07:59.812
And, by the barest of margins,
has ruled to drop all charges

07:59.896 --> 08:02.523
so long as you cooperate
from this moment forth.

08:03.983 --> 08:08.029
Your rash choice to save one child
put all of Trollmarket at risk.

08:08.112 --> 08:11.157
If any evil had been unleashed
unto this world,

08:11.240 --> 08:13.618
- the blood would have been on your hands.
- Uh...

08:15.995 --> 08:18.956
Are you sure nothing followed you
on your return?

08:19.040 --> 08:22.084
Draal never left his post
guarding the bridge.

08:25.004 --> 08:27.507
Hmmph. Very well, then.

08:29.258 --> 08:31.385
Are the Krubera really staying
permanently?

08:31.469 --> 08:37.183
Usurna feels their presence is required
in light of my questionable judgment.

08:40.602 --> 08:43.688
Speaking of such,
have you made any progress

08:43.773 --> 08:47.235
in tracking down the culprit
who stole my staff?

08:47.318 --> 08:50.279
We will not rest
until we bring them to justice.

08:50.363 --> 08:51.906
Yes, of course.

08:52.698 --> 08:58.246
I'm sure whoever took it had good reason
and will return it as soon as possible.

08:59.413 --> 09:02.250
I've put my neck out far enough
for you ungrateful fools.

09:02.333 --> 09:06.003
Any further, and she'll be sure
to lop my head right off.

09:06.087 --> 09:08.047
Thank you, Vendel.
It's good to see you, too.

09:08.130 --> 09:12.051
Yes, well, if you want to thank me,
go look into the goblin mess

09:12.134 --> 09:14.762
that one of our trolls discovered
on a salvage run.

09:14.845 --> 09:16.180
Goblin mess?

09:16.264 --> 09:21.394
There appears to be some droppings
in a dumpster behind the Arcadia Cinema.

09:21.477 --> 09:24.272
Goblins? We haven't seen
any of those in months.

09:24.355 --> 09:28.943
Oh, my gosh! Is this a call?
Like, a good ol' trollhunting mission?

09:30.444 --> 09:32.154
Just go.

09:43.207 --> 09:44.917
All right, coast is clear.

09:45.459 --> 09:48.671
Nothing like a simple mission
to get our mojo back, huh?

09:48.754 --> 09:50.590
Did you just say "mojo"?

09:50.673 --> 09:51.924
Um...

09:55.344 --> 09:57.221
Huh, smell poop.

09:57.305 --> 09:58.139
Ew!

10:02.727 --> 10:04.186
Blegh.

10:04.270 --> 10:05.229
Double "ew."

10:05.313 --> 10:07.315
Aaarrrgghh!!!, what is it?

10:07.982 --> 10:09.734
Mm, cat!

10:10.067 --> 10:11.777
No.

10:12.737 --> 10:14.155
Blood goblin.

10:14.238 --> 10:16.866
It cannot be.

10:16.949 --> 10:20.578
Blood goblins? Are those the
green ones or the blue ones?

10:20.661 --> 10:23.664
Contrary to their name,
blood goblins are white.

10:23.748 --> 10:24.915
But they can't be here!

10:24.999 --> 10:27.501
The only place you can find
white goblins is...

10:27.585 --> 10:28.586
The Darklands.

10:31.422 --> 10:32.965
No way! We destroyed the Bridge!

10:33.716 --> 10:37.887
Well, Draal left his post to save us.
You don't think, in that time...

10:37.970 --> 10:43.934
- If they got out, what if Gunmar got...
- No. No, no. We would know if he got out.

10:44.018 --> 10:47.271
Death would be on every doorstep,
Arcadia turned to ash.

10:47.355 --> 10:51.233
We would know.
These are just a few goblins.

10:51.317 --> 10:55.029
A few ferocious, insatiable,
bloodthirsty goblins.

10:56.197 --> 10:59.325
Jim, there's something
we've been meaning to ask you.

10:59.408 --> 11:00.368
Toby.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.913
If these little poopers are in Arcadia,
how do we find them?

11:03.996 --> 11:07.541
We don't find them, they find us.

11:08.334 --> 11:11.462
Once they're on your scent,
you can't shake 'em.

11:11.545 --> 11:12.880
They're gonna be after me.

11:12.963 --> 11:15.633
But you weren't the only one in there.
Nomura was with you.

11:15.716 --> 11:18.803
Nomura skipped town
as soon as we got out. She's long gone.

11:18.886 --> 11:20.179
Well, then why aren't they here?

11:20.888 --> 11:22.932
Because someone else was in there, too.

11:38.155 --> 11:39.240
Ah-tar!

11:39.990 --> 11:41.117
Uh-huh?

11:42.368 --> 11:43.536
Eh?

11:48.749 --> 11:50.418
Huh! Uh?

12:21.866 --> 12:23.576
Yee! Ya-hoo!

12:27.788 --> 12:28.706
Uh?

12:41.886 --> 12:44.847
Go, go, sushi! Happy fun time begin!

12:48.601 --> 12:51.020
Nice job! Celebrations!

12:59.570 --> 13:01.447
Yes!

13:09.038 --> 13:09.997
Shh!

13:10.664 --> 13:14.001
- Nana!
- Oh, Toby Pie!

13:14.084 --> 13:18.881
I thought you kids were upstairs playing.
There was an awful lot of noise.

13:18.964 --> 13:20.257
Uh...

13:20.341 --> 13:22.301
The goblins are here? Uh, I mean...

13:22.384 --> 13:24.803
I must have left my music on.

13:24.887 --> 13:26.013
"Goblins Are Here?"

13:26.096 --> 13:28.641
Oh, that's a horrible band name.

13:28.724 --> 13:32.686
I don't understand
what you kids listen to these days.

13:33.646 --> 13:36.273
Chompsky?

13:36.357 --> 13:38.067
No, not Chompsky!

13:40.194 --> 13:41.153
Oh...

13:41.237 --> 13:44.073
- Chompsky?
- Poor gnome.

13:44.156 --> 13:46.408
It was supposed to be a simple mission.

13:46.492 --> 13:48.953
There's no such thing
as a simple mission.

13:51.205 --> 13:54.416
The little guy survives the Darklands,
then goes out like this?

13:56.877 --> 13:58.379
Nothing's been right since...

13:59.338 --> 14:00.756
- since...
- Huh?

14:01.632 --> 14:03.801
Why did you go into the Darklands
without us?

14:03.884 --> 14:05.094
Wait, what?

14:05.177 --> 14:07.388
We found the amulet together,
we trained together,

14:07.471 --> 14:09.765
we killed Angor Rot together!

14:09.848 --> 14:13.978
- And then you just left us.
- Wait, is this how you all feel?

14:14.061 --> 14:16.438
You promised
we'd get my brother, together.

14:16.522 --> 14:18.357
After everything we'd been through,

14:18.440 --> 14:21.819
you said it was "Trollhunters,"
not "Trollhunter."

14:21.902 --> 14:22.903
Yeah.

14:22.987 --> 14:28.826
Gunmar wanted revenge for killing his
son. The amulet chose me to protect you.

14:28.909 --> 14:30.286
We protect each other!

14:32.246 --> 14:34.206
When I saw Aaarrrgghh!!! Die...

14:35.416 --> 14:37.793
I couldn't bear losing any more of you.

14:39.044 --> 14:43.507
I just wish everything could go back
to the way things were,

14:43.591 --> 14:46.218
when everything was... normal.

14:47.094 --> 14:52.016
Yeah, the Darklands was a failure.
I went in alone so you wouldn't have to.

14:52.099 --> 14:57.563
But classic Jim, you guys have
to rescue me anyway. Some hero I am.

14:58.856 --> 15:01.317
The amulet made you a Trollhunter.

15:02.359 --> 15:04.361
You made yourself a hero.

15:04.445 --> 15:06.405
But Chompsky didn't deserve this.

15:06.989 --> 15:09.658
He may have been small,
but he had a big...

15:11.452 --> 15:13.746
You mind? I was trying to give a eulogy.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.832
By Gorgus, he's picked up their scent!

15:16.916 --> 15:19.251
- The goblins?
- Gnome.

15:19.335 --> 15:20.377
Chompsky's alive?

15:21.086 --> 15:23.088
What are we waiting for?
Let's go find him!

15:28.844 --> 15:29.678
They're inside.

15:35.684 --> 15:38.354
Hush! We must be silent,
lest we alert them.

15:38.437 --> 15:39.688
Oh.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.106
Um...

15:41.190 --> 15:44.568
Let me guess. Shortcut?

16:03.045 --> 16:07.049
We're in a fireworks warehouse? So cool!

16:07.299 --> 16:08.634
Toby, focus.

16:08.717 --> 16:11.011
- We're here to save Chompsky.
- You're right.

16:11.470 --> 16:13.681
But we're coming back here later.

16:17.267 --> 16:20.437
Mmm... Nyum, nyum, nyum, nyum.

16:26.777 --> 16:30.572
Huh. Looks like there's two of 'em.
I'll flank right, you take left.

16:30.656 --> 16:32.408
There should be more, shouldn't there?

16:34.952 --> 16:36.996
Off me, you foul beast!

16:41.583 --> 16:44.294
- For the doom of Gunmar...
- Wrong one! Ahh!

16:44.878 --> 16:48.132
Little rusty. For the glory of Merlin,
Daylight is mine to command!

16:50.968 --> 16:52.386
Ahh!

16:54.680 --> 16:56.348
Foul, vile thing!

16:57.599 --> 16:58.434
Oh, no.

17:09.944 --> 17:12.948
Oh, boy! Fireworks fire! Do we put
it out? Or do we see what happens?

17:13.031 --> 17:16.743
Do we put it out? Do we put it out?
Or should we see what happens? Uh...

17:18.328 --> 17:21.040
Oh, hm...

17:21.123 --> 17:23.459
See what happens.

17:23.791 --> 17:25.752
Oh! Cool! Terrible, but cool.

17:27.253 --> 17:28.255
Stand back!

17:28.338 --> 17:30.758
Ugh! Useless!

17:32.342 --> 17:33.177
Or not.

17:45.355 --> 17:49.193
Behold! Our dreams
and nightmares are uniting!

17:52.738 --> 17:54.031
Get it off! Get it off!

17:54.114 --> 17:57.367
Poor little guy. You must be terrified.

17:59.286 --> 18:00.120
Oh...

18:01.497 --> 18:03.999
Ow! Hot! Let's go!

18:05.125 --> 18:07.961
Get it off! Get it off! Ahh! Get it off!

18:11.131 --> 18:15.219
- Ew! It died on me!
- Circle of life.

18:18.388 --> 18:19.890
We gotta get outta here!

18:21.058 --> 18:23.977
Hold still, will ya?

18:25.813 --> 18:28.148
You... You can understand me?

18:28.649 --> 18:29.817
Uh-huh.

18:29.900 --> 18:34.321
Master Jim, quickly! We saved the gnome!
We must get out of here!

18:35.405 --> 18:38.117
Did anything else escape the Darklands?

18:38.534 --> 18:39.701
Yes.

18:39.785 --> 18:41.787
Who else got out? Gunmar?

18:43.205 --> 18:44.289
Did Gunmar escape?

18:48.293 --> 18:51.296
Jim? Jim! Where are you?

18:54.800 --> 18:58.762
Master Jim!

19:00.681 --> 19:02.057
Come on!

19:03.517 --> 19:05.227
Aha! Avant!

19:12.901 --> 19:14.153
Fireworks.

19:14.236 --> 19:16.572
So much nicer from a distance, huh?

19:16.655 --> 19:17.656
Hey.

19:24.955 --> 19:26.206
Oh...

19:33.589 --> 19:34.548
Oh...

19:37.217 --> 19:38.677
Oh!

19:41.471 --> 19:44.600
I'm not sure it's official,
but it's sweet.

19:44.683 --> 19:47.603
Looks like some good came
out of the Darklands, after all.

19:47.686 --> 19:51.607
Yeah, you dingus!
My brother is back because of you.

19:51.690 --> 19:54.860
Some great came out of it.
We don't wanna go back and change that.

19:54.943 --> 19:57.905
That's true. We okay, T.P.?

19:57.988 --> 19:59.072
Whoo!

19:59.156 --> 20:00.240
We awesome-sauce.

20:00.324 --> 20:02.701
Although I hate that T.P.'s catching on.

20:02.784 --> 20:04.786
So, we shall not return to the past,

20:04.870 --> 20:07.915
but shall we return to Trollmarket?

20:07.998 --> 20:10.375
I feel uncomfortable
feeding the gnome's delusions.

20:10.459 --> 20:12.920
- Yeah, this is getting real awkward.
- Yeah.

20:13.003 --> 20:15.005
Oh, yeah! You know a shortcut.

20:16.506 --> 20:20.135
Actually, let's walk this time.
It's a nice night.

20:30.062 --> 20:32.064
Sounds of a battle?

20:33.190 --> 20:37.819
No. They try to make the night brighter.

20:37.903 --> 20:40.030
They fear the darkness.

20:46.620 --> 20:48.372
All that time...

20:48.956 --> 20:52.084
I had forgotten there were stars.

20:54.419 --> 20:57.673
If only my armies were here...

20:58.340 --> 21:03.387
We will build you another one, Lord.
We must get to the Janus Order.

21:06.139 --> 21:10.352
I hear a surface beast approach.
Slay it in the name of the Underlord!

21:21.989 --> 21:24.616
What manner of metal monster was that?

21:24.700 --> 21:26.326
Did he slay it?

21:28.412 --> 21:32.582
Aw, the poor thing thinks
he can still fight for you.

21:32.666 --> 21:35.585
I have no need for weakness.

21:36.086 --> 21:39.298
I will show you how destruction is done.

21:40.507 --> 21:43.010
Ugh!

21:54.604 --> 21:57.941
Oh, Dark Underlord,
we have been expecting you.

21:59.401 --> 22:03.155
We have the tools
to ensure your final victory.
