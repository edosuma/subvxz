happening more frequently.

then the cleaver incident in London.

of JFK,

02:05.858 --> 02:07.324

in Dallas.

10:52.581 --> 10:55.398
That's a lot of activity
for the White Supremacists.

10:55.400 --> 10:58.701
They may be waging
a new kind of war.

10:59.954 --> 11:01.638
Great view from up here.

11:01.640 --> 11:03.556
Nice sniper perch.

11:03.558 --> 11:07.343
Yeah. These aren't the kind of
windows that open at all, though.

11:07.345 --> 11:10.546
Uh, how long has this space
been under renovation?

11:10.548 --> 11:14.050
Building manager
said about 3 weeks.

11:14.052 --> 11:17.570
Hey, ladies.
Take a look at this.

11:19.273 --> 11:21.040
Ah. Huh.

11:22.059 --> 11:24.377
Smooth lines,
made by a glass cutter.

11:24.379 --> 11:26.880
The sniper could have
shot right through here.

11:26.882 --> 11:29.082
[Gunshots]

11:29.084 --> 11:30.335
It's the perfect location.

11:30.360 --> 11:32.336
He could have walked
in and out as a worker.

11:32.337 --> 11:35.088
And he carried his weapon
in a toolbox or a supply container.

11:36.774 --> 11:39.058
Other workers
would have seen him.

11:39.060 --> 11:42.362
Except it was 12:27 and they
would he been on their lunch break.

11:42.364 --> 11:45.098
Morgan: Which means he scoped out
this location beforehand.

11:45.100 --> 11:47.583
[Cell phone rings]

11:47.585 --> 11:48.751
Hey, Rossi, what's up?

11:48.753 --> 11:51.104
The analysis is back
on the bullets found in the Plaza.

11:51.106 --> 11:53.439
The lands and grooves
tell us they were fired

11:53.441 --> 11:55.108
from a .308 Nemesis.

11:55.110 --> 11:56.592
It's a semi-automatic
rifle.

11:56.594 --> 11:58.094
Same type of weapon
used in the murder

11:58.096 --> 11:59.978
of the black Texas
councilman 3 months ago.

11:59.979 --> 12:01.100
So maybe the Southern Aryans

12:01.125 --> 12:03.125
are waging a war against
the general population?

12:03.535 --> 12:04.984
It's more specific than that.
Victim number two,

12:04.986 --> 12:07.403
Daniel Bukowski, was prosecuting
the head of the Southern Aryans

12:07.405 --> 12:08.955
for the murder
of the councilman.

12:08.957 --> 12:11.774
So today's shooting could have
been a follower who wanted revenge.

12:11.776 --> 12:13.960
Or it was a hit
called by the leader,

12:13.962 --> 12:16.379
who, by the way, denies he's even
a member of the group.

12:16.381 --> 12:18.798
He claims to have quit
well before the councilman's murder,

12:18.800 --> 12:20.667
which is the basis
of his defense.

12:20.669 --> 12:24.053
Well, I think it's time to have
 a little talk with The General.

12:25.956 --> 12:28.408
Yeah, I admit I was once affiliated
with the Southern Aryans,

12:28.410 --> 12:31.561
but that was a mistake
and it was a long time ago.

12:31.563 --> 12:35.982
Look. I even had
my tattoos removed.

12:36.967 --> 12:39.102
Do you know why we're here?

12:39.104 --> 12:41.237
Well, I imagine
it's about the murder

12:41.239 --> 12:42.872
of that councilman
Adrian Clay,

12:42.874 --> 12:45.425
which I swear
I had no involvement in.

12:45.427 --> 12:47.543
Are you still in contact with
members of the Southern Aryans?

12:47.545 --> 12:48.945
Ma'am, I'm in prison.

12:48.947 --> 12:49.946
[Laughs]

12:49.948 --> 12:52.248
My opportunities to, uh,

12:52.250 --> 12:54.934
socialize
are somewhat limited.

12:54.936 --> 12:56.836
Well, that's not
what we heard.

12:56.838 --> 12:59.055
Rumor has it
you're in charge.

12:59.057 --> 13:00.990
In fact, you're still known
as The General.

13:00.992 --> 13:03.343
Some folks would
like to imbue me

13:03.345 --> 13:05.044
with a great deal of power,

13:05.046 --> 13:08.548
but it's a mantle
I choose not to accept.

13:08.550 --> 13:10.383
So you could
call the shots.

13:10.385 --> 13:13.152
You just choose not to?

13:13.154 --> 13:15.521
How can I lead
when I no longer believe?

13:17.291 --> 13:19.225
Huh.

13:22.279 --> 13:23.396
All right, Derek,

13:23.398 --> 13:27.433
well, we're wasting
our time here.

13:27.435 --> 13:28.951
I just have
a few more questions.

13:28.953 --> 13:30.236
No, really, let's just go.

13:30.238 --> 13:31.237
No, no, hey. Hey.

13:31.239 --> 13:32.338
Hold tight.

13:32.340 --> 13:34.073
It'll only take a second.

13:34.075 --> 13:36.342
What do you know
about today's events?

13:36.344 --> 13:37.293
Today's events?

13:37.295 --> 13:39.112
You must have heard
about the shooting?

13:42.916 --> 13:44.717
Enlighten me.

13:44.719 --> 13:46.452
The assistant D.A.
prosecuting you

13:46.454 --> 13:48.454
for the murder of the black
councilman was killed.

13:48.456 --> 13:51.074
Did you order that hit?

13:51.076 --> 13:53.109
I had nothing
to do with it.

13:57.147 --> 14:00.983
Because you're not
racist anymore?

14:00.985 --> 14:03.686
Mr. Dawson,
I can't tell you

14:03.688 --> 14:05.905
how impressed I am
with you.

14:07.891 --> 14:10.493
So I'd like
to shake your hand

14:10.495 --> 14:11.952
and congratulate you

14:11.977 --> 14:14.035
for making such a positive
change in your life.

14:17.451 --> 14:20.203
I'd be really careful,

14:20.205 --> 14:24.590
because somebody might think
you still believe.

14:32.415 --> 14:35.518
[Door buzzes]

14:41.358 --> 14:43.092
The guy had no idea.

14:43.094 --> 14:44.560
I mean, he's racist as hell,

14:44.562 --> 14:46.395
but he did not have
the assistant D.A. killed.

14:46.397 --> 14:48.064
He was way too surprised
when we broke the news.

14:48.066 --> 14:51.267
He was way too angry at us
to even be happy about it.

14:51.269 --> 14:53.653
This is the only case
the assistant D.A. was trying

14:53.655 --> 14:55.271
he has not other
know enemies,

14:55.273 --> 14:57.473
which means he wasn't
the specific target.

14:57.475 --> 15:01.160
Ok, well, who else uses
a .308 rifle?

15:01.162 --> 15:02.411
In Texas?

15:02.413 --> 15:05.114
Hunters, the minutemen,
housewives.

15:05.116 --> 15:07.333
Which unfortunately
doesn't narrow down the field.

15:07.335 --> 15:09.969
Well, the 6 bullets that didn't
hit people have all been found.

15:09.971 --> 15:12.839
They were in the cafe sign, planters,
and a couple of trees.

15:12.841 --> 15:14.891
It all points to him
not being a very good shot.

15:14.893 --> 15:16.175
Or maybe
he's a great shot.

15:16.177 --> 15:17.960
According to the doctors
at the hospital,

15:17.962 --> 15:19.679
all 6 victims
were hit with kill shots

15:19.681 --> 15:21.575
directly to the head,
base of neck, and heart.

15:21.576 --> 15:24.382
The sixth victim only survived
because of an anatomic anomaly.

15:24.383 --> 15:25.579
He had a reversed heart,

15:25.604 --> 15:26.985
but the bullet still
tore through major arteries

15:26.986 --> 15:28.252
and they couldn't save him.

15:28.254 --> 15:29.753
So what seems to be
disorganized shooting

15:29.755 --> 15:31.939
is actually organized
and intentional.

15:31.941 --> 15:33.374
A forensic countermeasure?

15:33.376 --> 15:34.892
Mm-hmm. To make law
enforcement believe

15:34.894 --> 15:36.627
the unsub's not
a specially-trained shooter.

15:36.629 --> 15:38.430
Which means the victims
weren't random at all.

15:38.431 --> 15:39.980
He knew exactly
who he wanted to kill.

15:39.982 --> 15:44.552
So if it wasn't the attorney,
who's the real target?

15:53.328 --> 15:56.063
[Line ringing]

15:56.065 --> 15:58.231

16:29.928 --> 16:31.790
There are 3 victims, but
a witness said that they

16:31.815 --> 16:33.513
heard more than 7 gunshots.

16:33.514 --> 16:35.097
No one ever saw the shooter.

16:35.099 --> 16:36.832
I don't think we're
dealing with a terrorist.

16:36.834 --> 16:39.268
We passed a mall
less than a half mile away.

16:39.270 --> 16:41.020
I--I'm not following you.

16:41.022 --> 16:44.190
Well, a mall presents a
target-rich environment for a terrorist

16:44.192 --> 16:46.008
who wants to incite
panic and fear,

16:46.010 --> 16:48.344
and if that was his aim,
he would have been more effective there.

16:48.346 --> 16:50.646
So choosing this gas station
instead means what?

16:50.648 --> 16:53.366
He must have been going after
a specific person or people.

16:53.368 --> 16:55.351
We should be trying
to make a connection

16:55.353 --> 16:57.336
between the victims here
and in the plaza.

16:57.338 --> 16:58.836
Considering the position
of the bodies

16:58.837 --> 17:00.019
and the fact
that no one saw him,

17:00.024 --> 17:02.208
he had to be shooting
from over there.

17:03.260 --> 17:05.877
[Horn honking]

17:08.749 --> 17:11.300
The easiest way to stay hidden would
have been from the back of a van

17:11.301 --> 17:12.952
or the trunk of a car
parked here.

17:12.954 --> 17:14.252
Like the D.C. snipers
in '02.

17:14.255 --> 17:15.755
A smart move
would have been

17:15.757 --> 17:17.573
to stay put for a while
after all the mayhem.

17:17.575 --> 17:20.541
Driving off right away would
have just drawn attention.

17:20.544 --> 17:22.828
How much variation
is there in the traffic pattern here?

17:22.829 --> 17:25.348
This is it. It's pretty much
the same all the time,

17:25.349 --> 17:27.733
except in the middle
of the night maybe.

17:28.802 --> 17:31.938
So the unsub had to time
his shot to the quarter second

17:31.940 --> 17:33.806
to shoot between traffic
and the gas pumps

17:33.808 --> 17:35.224
and hit all 3 victims.

17:35.226 --> 17:37.977
And he did it
from a concealed position.

17:37.979 --> 17:40.896
He's better than good.
He's a sharpshooter.

17:47.704 --> 17:48.955
Where are we?

17:48.957 --> 17:51.791
A safe place to hide
for now.

18:00.917 --> 18:03.135
Load the mag.

18:03.137 --> 18:04.637
Release the safety.

18:04.639 --> 18:07.890

18:07.892 --> 18:09.758
What are we doing here?

18:09.760 --> 18:12.528
Waiting for Mr. Doe.
He's gonna extract us.

18:12.530 --> 18:13.813
What's his first name?

18:13.815 --> 18:14.814
John.

18:14.816 --> 18:16.782
John as in John Doe?

18:16.784 --> 18:18.234
His name doesn't matter.

18:18.236 --> 18:19.368
Do you trust him?

18:19.370 --> 18:21.537
In my line of work,
I don't trust anyone.

18:21.539 --> 18:23.706
But he'll help us
in the situation.

18:27.661 --> 18:29.111
What are you doing?

18:29.113 --> 18:31.313
Locking the window.

18:31.315 --> 18:34.884
I don't regret
what I did, you know?

18:34.886 --> 18:36.669
I'm not here to judge.

18:36.671 --> 18:38.804
A month ago
I didn't even know you,

18:38.806 --> 18:40.973
and now look at us,
hiding out together.

18:40.975 --> 18:43.092
You must blame me
for dragging you into this.

18:43.094 --> 18:44.593
It was my choice
to take the job.

18:44.595 --> 18:49.565
It was all worth it, wasn't it,
for a chance at real happiness?

18:49.567 --> 18:51.650
It's not for me to say.

18:51.652 --> 18:54.353
But if you cross
powerful people,

18:54.355 --> 18:56.055
there are consequences.

18:56.057 --> 18:58.441
You don't have to
do this, you know.

18:58.443 --> 19:00.493
It's too late.
I'm tied to you now,

19:00.495 --> 19:02.178
which means they are
hunting me, too.

19:02.180 --> 19:03.229
What if there was something--

19:03.231 --> 19:05.281
[sounds outside door]

19:05.283 --> 19:07.483
I thought you said
this place was safe.

19:07.485 --> 19:09.118
It is.

19:09.120 --> 19:12.955
But the people coming
after us are the best.

19:15.642 --> 19:19.445
We're looking for an LDSK,
or a long distance serial killer.

19:19.447 --> 19:21.997
He's a very skilled marksman
with a God complex.

19:21.999 --> 19:24.300
Morgan: He derives pleasure
out of remaining unseen

19:24.302 --> 19:26.135
and determining the fates
of people from afar.

19:26.137 --> 19:27.970
He's criminally sophisticated
and methodical,

19:27.972 --> 19:30.272
concealing his method
of ingress and egress,

19:30.274 --> 19:32.341
leaving little evidence behind
in his sniper perches.

19:32.343 --> 19:34.843
Blake: This suggests
a great deal of experience,

19:34.845 --> 19:39.014
so this unsub has a military
or law enforcement background,

19:39.016 --> 19:40.783
possibly even Special Forces.

19:40.785 --> 19:43.069
His victims at first appear
to be targets of opportunity,

19:43.071 --> 19:45.988
but it now appears that one or
more of them are targets of choice.

19:45.990 --> 19:48.040
The remaining victims
are collateral damage

19:48.042 --> 19:50.543
to be used as a forensic
countermeasure,

19:50.545 --> 19:52.661
similar to what John Allen
Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo

19:52.663 --> 19:54.713
did with the D.C.
sniper case in 2002.

19:54.715 --> 19:56.799
This means there's
some unknown connection

19:56.801 --> 20:00.369
between one or more victims at the first
and second crime scenes.

20:00.371 --> 20:03.556
What about the Caucasian male
the eyewitness saw at the Plaza?

20:03.558 --> 20:05.541
It's something to consider, but
we can't rule out others.

20:05.543 --> 20:08.177
We know that the unsub
is likely in his late 30s to 40s

20:08.179 --> 20:09.478
in order to have
the means and patience

20:09.480 --> 20:11.514
to plan and execute
these attacks.

20:11.516 --> 20:13.432
Hotch: If he still has
specific targets,

20:13.434 --> 20:15.101
it's likely he won't
wait long to attack,

20:15.103 --> 20:17.736
so the public needs
to remain vigilant.

20:32.702 --> 20:35.471
You never told me why
you left South Africa.

20:38.258 --> 20:41.210
I was betrayed by people
I thought were my friends.

20:41.212 --> 20:45.131
I was labeled a traitor
and hung out to dry.

20:53.923 --> 20:56.842
Don't you get lonely
doing this work?

20:57.944 --> 20:59.278
I'm used to it.

20:59.280 --> 21:02.448
I have the network,
my business alliances.

21:02.450 --> 21:04.049
Like Mr. Doe.

21:04.051 --> 21:07.570
We'll take turns
keeping watch.

21:07.572 --> 21:08.904
Do you know how?

21:08.906 --> 21:10.406
Look out a window?

21:10.408 --> 21:11.773
It's not that easy.

21:11.775 --> 21:13.576
There's actually
a skill to it.

21:13.578 --> 21:15.611
You need to be able
to identify everything

21:15.613 --> 21:18.197
in your field of vision
in two seconds.

21:18.199 --> 21:20.065
What are you
looking for?

21:20.067 --> 21:21.217
Close your eyes.

21:21.219 --> 21:22.218
Why?

21:22.220 --> 21:23.285
Just do it.

21:23.287 --> 21:24.720
What's this about?

21:27.724 --> 21:30.392
Ok. Open them.

21:36.566 --> 21:40.019
Tell me exactly what you saw.

21:40.021 --> 21:42.538
Small objects.
Household things.

21:42.540 --> 21:43.656
Describe them.

21:43.658 --> 21:45.608
A button.
What color?

21:45.610 --> 21:47.476
Red.
What else?

21:47.478 --> 21:49.228
Describe the objects.

21:49.230 --> 21:50.896
Color and size.

21:50.898 --> 21:52.198
A paperclip.

21:52.200 --> 21:53.999
Color and size.

21:54.001 --> 21:55.584
Silver. One inch.

21:55.586 --> 21:58.671
There was also a blue rubber band,
maybe 4 inches long.

21:58.673 --> 21:59.838
What else?

22:02.042 --> 22:04.193
I can't remember
anything else.

22:04.195 --> 22:05.994
That's 3 out of 10.

22:05.996 --> 22:07.379
You need to do better
than that

22:07.381 --> 22:09.498
or you'll get us
both killed.

22:10.817 --> 22:15.721
Blake: We know the unsub
had a specific target, but who was it?

22:15.723 --> 22:17.172
Well, we checked out
Ricardo Hernandez.

22:17.174 --> 22:18.557
He was going through
a divorce.

22:18.559 --> 22:20.859
Melanie Chen, who's appealing
a custody decision.

22:20.861 --> 22:22.511
But nothing seems out of line.

22:22.513 --> 22:25.948
Beside the assistant D.A., no one
seems to have any clear enemies.

22:25.950 --> 22:27.366
All right, let's look
at this a different way.

22:27.368 --> 22:28.684
The Plaza was an open space.

22:28.686 --> 22:30.202
The unsub would want
to make sure

22:30.204 --> 22:32.354
that his target couldn't get away.
How would he ensure that?

22:32.356 --> 22:34.173
Kill his real target first.

22:34.175 --> 22:35.808
Too obvious. He would
know law enforcement

22:35.810 --> 22:38.026
would focus more
on his first victim than the others,

22:38.028 --> 22:39.712
which your office
definitely did.

22:39.714 --> 22:41.363
You know, the fact is,

22:41.365 --> 22:43.716
this is
an experienced sniper

22:43.718 --> 22:46.418
who can account for timing.

22:50.039 --> 22:52.558
After the first shot,
no one moves.

22:52.560 --> 22:54.042
People are puzzled.

22:54.044 --> 22:56.228
Everyone's reaction
is to look for a source of the sound.

22:56.230 --> 23:00.249
[Gunshot]

23:00.251 --> 23:01.800
[Muted shouting]

23:01.802 --> 23:03.152
[Gunshot]

23:03.154 --> 23:05.654
After the second shot,
it takes the average person

23:05.656 --> 23:08.107
one and a half seconds
to cognitively process

23:08.109 --> 23:11.443
that they're in a potentially
life-threatening situation.

23:11.445 --> 23:16.365
It takes another .7 seconds
for a physical response to kick in.

23:16.367 --> 23:17.866
[Muted shouting]

23:17.868 --> 23:19.451
[Gunshot]

23:19.453 --> 23:23.255
By which time the third shot
has already been fired.

23:28.745 --> 23:31.880
So the unsub wanted
victim number 3.

23:31.882 --> 23:34.016
Well, anyone after number 3
had a chance of getting away,

23:34.018 --> 23:36.518
and the unsub wouldn't
have taken that risk.

23:36.520 --> 23:39.355
Victim number 3--
Alice Emerson, 44,

23:39.357 --> 23:41.940
social worker, married
with a 12-year-old son.

23:41.942 --> 23:43.726
Husband's been
too distraught to talk.

23:43.728 --> 23:46.312
Well, Blake and I can see
if he's ready to talk now.

23:46.314 --> 23:49.231
The last 8 years she worked
at a women's shelter downtown.

23:49.233 --> 23:51.317
That can't be
the easiest of jobs.

23:51.319 --> 23:54.653
Let's see if her boss
can shed some light.

23:58.074 --> 24:00.609
Alice seemed anxious
this morning.

24:00.611 --> 24:02.878
I asked her about it
and she said her mother

24:02.880 --> 24:05.781
was having a medical
procedure done.

24:05.783 --> 24:09.001
So being stressed was out
of the ordinary for her?

24:09.003 --> 24:10.548
Well, I won't lie.

24:10.573 --> 24:12.678
Working here does take
an emotional toll.

24:13.090 --> 24:14.473
Escaping an abusive
situation

24:14.475 --> 24:15.891
can be incredibly
difficult.

24:15.893 --> 24:18.193
I imagine your job's
frustrating.

24:18.195 --> 24:20.346
The victims are a mess,

24:20.348 --> 24:22.481
physically, emotionally,

24:22.483 --> 24:26.318
and they often go back
to their abuser.

24:26.320 --> 24:28.904
The fact is
most employees burn out.

24:28.906 --> 24:31.223
They don't work here
more than a few years.

24:31.225 --> 24:32.825
It sounds like Alice
was the exception.

24:32.827 --> 24:35.561
What exactly
did her job entail?

24:35.563 --> 24:37.663
She was the point
of first contact.

24:37.665 --> 24:40.499
If a woman was committed
to leaving her abuser,

24:40.501 --> 24:43.535
Alice would funnel them
to a community angel.

24:43.537 --> 24:46.388
I take it that's somebody
who provides them a temporary home?

24:46.390 --> 24:47.823
That and more.

24:47.825 --> 24:51.009
They may help create
a new identity for the client.

24:51.011 --> 24:53.846
I'm assuming the secrecy
is to protect them from their abusers?

24:53.848 --> 24:57.383
The men that they're
escaping can be incredibly violent

24:57.385 --> 24:58.834
and vindictive.

24:58.836 --> 25:00.969
A whole network
has been created

25:00.971 --> 25:02.471
to help protect
these women.

25:02.473 --> 25:04.223
Sort of like
an underground railroad.

25:04.225 --> 25:05.474
Exactly.

25:05.476 --> 25:07.476
I just work
at the starting point.

25:07.478 --> 25:09.978
I don't even know
all the players in the network.

25:09.980 --> 25:13.031
The police have been through
her email and her cell phone

25:13.033 --> 25:15.684
and it seems they've been
completely wiped clean.

25:15.686 --> 25:18.120
Does that have anything
to do with this job?

25:18.122 --> 25:20.072
6 years ago,
an angry ex-boyfriend

25:20.074 --> 25:21.800
broke into our computers

25:21.825 --> 25:23.825
and found the location
of his girlfriend

25:23.861 --> 25:25.244
and he killed her

25:25.246 --> 25:27.963
and the community angel
she was staying with

25:27.965 --> 25:30.432
before committing suicide.

25:32.702 --> 25:34.002
Excuse me.

25:34.004 --> 25:36.088
Living with that type
of secrecy

25:36.090 --> 25:38.540
is a nightmare
for everyone involved.

25:38.542 --> 25:43.145
But I...get why
they have to do it.

25:43.147 --> 25:45.180
You ok?

25:45.182 --> 25:46.999
For a moment there
you looked kind of worried.

25:47.001 --> 25:48.550
Yeah, I'm all good.

25:48.552 --> 25:51.052
If you were worried
about something, you'd tell me, right?

25:51.054 --> 25:54.890
Spence, I'm not worried about
 anything except maybe solving this case.

25:56.409 --> 25:59.962
It's too bad all those emails
and texts are gone forever.

25:59.964 --> 26:04.333
Um, I'm sorry, have you
ever met Penelope Garcia?

26:12.175 --> 26:14.092
Alice Emerson's husband
said they live a quiet life.

26:14.094 --> 26:16.795
But this morning before the shooting,
she was acting preoccupied.

26:16.797 --> 26:18.297
When he asked her
what was bothering her,

26:18.299 --> 26:19.598
she said it was
something at work.

26:19.600 --> 26:21.133
Yet her boss claims
she was worried

26:21.135 --> 26:22.935
about a medical procedure
her mom was having.

26:22.937 --> 26:24.520
[Cell phone rings]

26:24.522 --> 26:25.771
Go ahead, Garcia.

26:25.773 --> 26:27.689
I am loathe to admit this,
but I'm having a hard time

26:27.691 --> 26:30.425
recovering all of Alice
Emerson's texts and emails.

26:30.427 --> 26:33.979
That company that runs chat alert
is damn good at scrambling their data.

26:33.981 --> 26:37.115
And although I am as fast as
hot lightning, my server is not

26:37.117 --> 26:39.818
because it needs updating,
so if someone with great hair and a tie

26:39.820 --> 26:41.820
could approve the funding
to update such server,

26:41.822 --> 26:43.739
we could get this show
on the road and I could--

26:43.741 --> 26:45.073
Put in a requisition,
Garcia.

26:45.075 --> 26:46.992
Thank you, sir.
Filing form 9093B now.

26:46.994 --> 26:50.496
I am familiar with it
and the void it disappears into.

26:50.498 --> 26:54.416
Ok. I did manage to piece
together Alice's last text.

26:54.418 --> 26:55.629
It was sent at 11:40,

26:55.654 --> 26:57.600
which is less than an hour
before the shooting.

26:57.755 --> 26:58.996
It's a doozy.

26:59.021 --> 27:01.021
It was sent to a prepaid
cell phone and it is this:

27:01.725 --> 27:02.925
"Rebecca Schroeder."

27:02.927 --> 27:06.812
You lost me.
We're talking about Alice Emerson.

27:06.814 --> 27:10.899
I know. And that's the text she sent,
that name, Rebecca Schroeder.

27:12.235 --> 27:14.336
She's the second shooting
victim at the gas station.

27:14.338 --> 27:17.322
Yeah. Rebecca is an Econ
professor at East Texas College.

27:17.324 --> 27:18.941
She's 50, never married
and no kids,

27:18.943 --> 27:21.827
although she does have a sister
who lives in Austin with 5 kids,

27:21.829 --> 27:23.812
that she's close to. She has
season tickets to the opera.

27:23.814 --> 27:25.531
Beside that,
she lives like a monk.

27:25.533 --> 27:28.133
According to her credit card record,
she doesn't even own a pet.

27:28.135 --> 27:30.352
Any idea where Alice and
Rebecca's paths might have crossed?

27:30.354 --> 27:33.321
No. I ran a cursory search
and I've come up with nada.

27:33.323 --> 27:36.525
What if Rebecca Schroeder
was a community angel?

27:36.527 --> 27:38.994
If she was part of the network
that shelters abused women,

27:38.996 --> 27:40.996
the unsub could be looking
for someone they both helped.

27:40.998 --> 27:42.965
Alice was the first contact
for an abused woman,

27:42.967 --> 27:45.350
but the unsub needed to know
who the woman was handed off to.

27:45.352 --> 27:46.718
In this case it was Rebecca.

27:46.720 --> 27:48.303
He may have threatened
to kill them or a loved one

27:48.305 --> 27:50.088
if they didn't give him
the information that he wanted.

27:50.090 --> 27:51.490
After they did,
he killed them anyway

27:51.492 --> 27:53.125
to bury the evidence
and cut off the trail.

27:53.127 --> 27:55.527
It's probably why
he shot at Rebecca's phone.

27:55.529 --> 27:56.519
If Alice gave up Rebecca's name,

27:56.544 --> 27:58.904
Rebecca may have also given up
something vital to the unsub.

Rebecca was a single woman
living in a 3-bedroom house,

29:48.609 --> 29:53.345
yet she converted this walk-in closet
into another bedroom.

29:53.347 --> 29:55.013
Well, JJ was right.

29:55.015 --> 29:56.748
She's most likely
a community angel.

29:56.750 --> 29:59.417
A woman on the run would want
to stay as hidden as possible.

29:59.419 --> 30:01.970
An interior room like this
would make someone feel safe,

30:01.972 --> 30:04.806
so they stayed here
until what?

30:06.392 --> 30:09.861
Huh. Probably until
they had a new identity.

30:09.863 --> 30:12.681
Look. They changed
their appearance here.

30:12.683 --> 30:15.651
So, where was the next stop?

30:18.437 --> 30:20.973
So I followed up with some of
the other social workers

30:20.975 --> 30:23.976
at the women's shelter, and it
turns out that Rebecca Schroeder

30:23.978 --> 30:25.610
was in fact
a community angel.

31:42.355 --> 31:44.206
and Rebecca never even
invited her inside.

her practically hiding fugitives?

she never had any visitors

31:48.979 --> 31:51.580

a speedy send courier.

31:51.582 --> 31:52.964
She thought the two of them
were sleeping together

31:52.966 --> 31:55.366
because the courier would back
the truck up to the garage

31:55.368 --> 31:56.868

I don't know, he knew
something about his wife.

34:48.083 --> 34:50.918
The way he smiled at me
before he died, he was smug.

He's smart enough
to distance himself.

35:05.235 --> 35:06.951
What else do we know
about him, Garcia?

35:06.953 --> 35:08.436
He grew up in Albania.

35:08.438 --> 35:10.938
He served in that country's

35:10.940 --> 35:13.407
He moved to the United States
for school when he was 23.

35:13.409 --> 35:15.793
And he's worked for Black Cross
ever since graduation.

35:15.795 --> 35:17.111

is make one phone call,

he farm this job out to?

while wouldn't he just bust down

Because he's a sniper,
and that means

36:28.032 --> 36:30.499
a comfortable kill zone
for him includes distance.

36:30.501 --> 36:32.868
He'll want to make her death
look like a random attack,

36:32.870 --> 36:34.704

other victims as well.

By using a mental exercise
called fantasy integration.

a scenario involving a target

that keeps that person
at the forefront of their mind.
