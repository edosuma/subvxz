00:22.690 --> 00:25.593
(phone buzzing)

00:30.898 --> 00:31.865
Oh...

00:31.899 --> 00:33.067
(coughing)

00:33.101 --> 00:34.034
Shit.

00:36.237 --> 00:37.571
(sighs)

00:47.715 --> 00:48.949
Are you coming back tonight?

00:51.385 --> 00:52.953
Um...

00:56.157 --> 00:57.891
No...

01:09.470 --> 01:11.305
Thanks.

01:12.573 --> 01:15.543
(piano music)

01:15.576 --> 01:22.483
*

01:27.688 --> 01:28.622
(dog barking in distance)

01:28.656 --> 01:30.624
(door opening)

01:44.138 --> 01:45.706
Are you high?

01:48.709 --> 01:50.711
Not really.

01:53.013 --> 01:54.848
Jesus.

02:05.526 --> 02:07.195
You have to put it up.
My hair.

02:25.213 --> 02:26.747
Leave it.

02:33.921 --> 02:36.557
This is really important, okay?

02:36.590 --> 02:37.791
-I got it.
-I'm being serious.

02:37.825 --> 02:39.260
I got it.

02:42.196 --> 02:45.499
Monique is really
good for me.

02:45.533 --> 02:47.701
She knows people,
and they're all gonna be there.

02:52.540 --> 02:54.375
I got it.

02:55.743 --> 02:58.312
It's also good for Lottie.

02:58.346 --> 03:00.714
Why else do you think
I'd be here?

03:03.584 --> 03:06.554
(jazzy music)

03:06.587 --> 03:13.527
*

03:21.435 --> 03:23.437
(engine turns over)

03:27.074 --> 03:29.843
(gasps)
Oh, happy Juneteenth!

03:29.877 --> 03:32.613
Oh, Vanessa.
You look amazing.

03:32.646 --> 03:35.082
Oh, thank you so much
for having us.

03:35.115 --> 03:37.351
And hello.
I'm Monique.

03:37.385 --> 03:39.086
You must be Mr. Hubby?

03:39.119 --> 03:40.087
This is Earnest.

03:40.120 --> 03:43.023
Yeah. Me.
Mr. Hubby.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.859
Oh, well, come inside,
come inside.

03:45.893 --> 03:48.762
-* I got a rope
all: * Huh!

03:48.796 --> 03:51.932
* Into thy kingdom

03:51.965 --> 03:54.935
all: * Huh!
-* Ain't that good news

03:54.968 --> 03:57.204
Are they up for auction
after the party, or--

03:57.237 --> 03:58.572
(laughter)

03:58.606 --> 04:00.140
Uh-uh-uh.

04:00.173 --> 04:03.210
So, to the left,
we have the bar.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.212
To the right,
we have the bathroom.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.047
Oh, we have bathrooms
upstairs, downstairs--

04:07.080 --> 04:08.982
many, many bathrooms.

04:09.016 --> 04:10.718
And where is Craig?

04:10.751 --> 04:12.753
Happy Freedom Day!

04:12.786 --> 04:14.388
(chuckles)

04:14.422 --> 04:15.423
Mm, mm, mm.

04:15.456 --> 04:17.224
Welcome.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.158
Craig, Monique's husband.

04:20.361 --> 04:22.129
You're familiar.

04:22.162 --> 04:23.631
Cherokee?

04:23.664 --> 04:25.333
Uh, no.
Just black.

04:25.366 --> 04:27.234
(laughter)

04:27.267 --> 04:29.737
No, Cherokee Town
and Country Club.

04:29.770 --> 04:30.838
You're a member, right?

04:30.871 --> 04:32.673
Uh, no, no, no.

04:32.706 --> 04:34.475
-You sure?
-Yes.

04:34.508 --> 04:37.144
You must be confusing me
with some other black guy.

04:37.177 --> 04:39.747
-* Ain't that good news
-Ah!

04:39.780 --> 04:41.181
You don't think I'm capable

04:41.214 --> 04:44.318
of telling African-Americans
apart?

04:44.352 --> 04:45.586
N--no.

04:45.619 --> 04:48.255
(laughing)
Just messing with you, man.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.957
Welcome.

04:49.990 --> 04:54.261
God, it is so great
to meet both of you.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.429
* I got a savior

04:55.463 --> 04:58.966
So, do you want
to get me a drink?

04:58.999 --> 05:01.969
Anything?
Like a vodka cranberry?

05:02.002 --> 05:04.304
Anything for you.

05:04.338 --> 05:06.474
(jazz music)

05:06.507 --> 05:08.442
-Hey, could I get a, uh--
-Sir.

05:08.476 --> 05:10.310
I'll be right with you
soon as you take your place

05:10.344 --> 05:12.880
in the queue--
the line?

05:12.913 --> 05:14.648
I know what a queue is.

05:14.682 --> 05:16.016
*

05:16.049 --> 05:18.719
Thank you.

05:18.752 --> 05:20.488
How can I help you, sir?

05:20.521 --> 05:22.856
Yeah, I'd like, uh,
a vodka cranberry.

05:22.890 --> 05:25.726
I'm sorry, sir, we aren't
equipped to make that drink.

05:25.759 --> 05:28.161
-A screwdriver, then.
-Sir.

05:28.195 --> 05:30.998
We have a fixed cocktail menu
for the evening.

05:31.031 --> 05:32.800
Please make a selection.

05:32.833 --> 05:35.135
*

05:35.168 --> 05:37.405
"Juneteenth Juice.
Frozen Freedom Margarita.

05:37.438 --> 05:39.740
Emancipation Eggnog."
It's June.

05:39.773 --> 05:43.377
Nigga, do I got to explain
alliteration? Hmm?

05:43.411 --> 05:45.813
I'll have the Plantation
Master Poison.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.648
(rattling)

05:47.681 --> 05:49.817
-So sorry about Earnest.
-Princeton--

05:49.850 --> 05:51.184
He just thinks he's so funny--

05:51.218 --> 05:52.686
Oh, don't be, girl.

05:52.720 --> 05:53.887
I like him.

05:53.921 --> 05:57.525
Ramon!
Mm!

05:57.558 --> 05:59.493
Smile.

05:59.527 --> 06:02.563
This is a celebration.
Not an orphanage.

06:02.596 --> 06:03.931
Hmm?

06:03.964 --> 06:05.566
*

06:05.599 --> 06:08.168
(sighs)

06:08.201 --> 06:10.738
I'm glad you came.
Mm-hmm.

06:10.771 --> 06:12.706
I know we haven't known
each other for a long time,

06:12.740 --> 06:16.176
but I mean it when I say...

06:16.209 --> 06:19.112
you remind me of me.

06:19.146 --> 06:22.883
And we're gonna make sure
you get everything you want.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.518
Still want to be a teacher?

06:24.552 --> 06:26.787
The principal of Pace University
is here.

06:26.820 --> 06:29.122
Easy--want to be a designer,
an event planner,

06:29.156 --> 06:31.425
-a real housewife?
-Girl, quit playing--

06:31.459 --> 06:32.693
Shh!

06:32.726 --> 06:35.463
You can have anything
that you want.

06:35.496 --> 06:37.097
You are a smart, beautiful,

06:37.130 --> 06:40.100
and determined lady
like me.

06:40.133 --> 06:42.970
And your fancy Ivy League
husband is here,

06:43.003 --> 06:45.773
so there's no problem there.

06:45.806 --> 06:47.074
Thanks, Mo.

06:47.107 --> 06:48.642
-Glad you came.
-(chuckles)

06:48.676 --> 06:51.378
*

06:51.411 --> 06:54.381
(traditional choral music)

06:54.414 --> 07:01.321
*

07:13.033 --> 07:15.936
(whispering)
What the fuck?

07:15.969 --> 07:17.771
Nobody can give you freedom.

07:17.805 --> 07:21.174
Nobody can give you equality,
or justice, or anything.

07:21.208 --> 07:23.977
If you're a man, you take it.

07:24.011 --> 07:25.979
Malcolm X quote
that inspired that painting.

07:26.013 --> 07:27.180
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to--

07:27.214 --> 07:29.082
Stop, stop.
You're fine.

07:29.116 --> 07:31.485
You--you want a real drink?

07:31.519 --> 07:33.120
-Sure.
-All right.

07:33.153 --> 07:37.625
*

07:37.658 --> 07:41.529
That's a...interesting
interpretation of that quote.

07:41.562 --> 07:43.597
*

07:43.631 --> 07:45.833
It's the only interpretation.

07:45.866 --> 07:49.537
It accurately depicts the plight
of the contemporary black man.

07:49.570 --> 07:52.039
That is why I painted it.

07:52.072 --> 07:53.674
Wow.

07:53.707 --> 07:55.375
So, Earn.

07:55.408 --> 07:57.945
What kind of business you in?

07:57.978 --> 08:00.514
Music management.

08:00.548 --> 08:02.683
-Yes.
-Yes?

08:02.716 --> 08:04.317
No, it's just--it's nice.

08:04.351 --> 08:06.386
A brother on the business side
of music.

08:06.419 --> 08:08.221
-What do you mean?
-Mm.

08:08.255 --> 08:09.623
Please.

08:09.657 --> 08:11.792
Well, music is
such an integral part

08:11.825 --> 08:13.527
of the African-American culture.

08:13.561 --> 08:16.630
It's expression.
And it's been stripped from you.

08:16.664 --> 08:18.498
Black music artists are products

08:18.532 --> 08:21.068
for white American consumption
and appropriation.

08:21.101 --> 08:23.804
Mm.
Is this Hennessy?

08:23.837 --> 08:26.540
Mm-hmm.

08:26.574 --> 08:29.176
Are you an archaeologist
in African studies?

08:29.209 --> 08:30.578
I'm an optometrist.

08:30.611 --> 08:33.013
I see a picture of you
in Africa over there.

08:33.046 --> 08:35.315
Oh, that.

08:35.348 --> 08:37.551
Yeah, that was--whew.

08:37.585 --> 08:39.687
That was a pilgrimage.

08:39.720 --> 08:43.190
Needed to pay my respects.

08:43.223 --> 08:46.393
Ask for forgiveness--
well, you know, right?

08:46.426 --> 08:48.762
I don't.
I really don't.

08:48.796 --> 08:52.700
What, you--you've never
been to Africa?

08:52.733 --> 08:54.167
No.

08:54.201 --> 08:55.836
You got to go!

08:55.869 --> 08:58.205
Man, it's your motherland.
What are you thinking?

08:58.238 --> 09:00.507
Missing--what are you?

09:00.540 --> 09:01.942
Huh?
What?

09:01.975 --> 09:03.376
Where are your ancestors from?

09:03.410 --> 09:06.880
Congo?
Ivory Coast?

09:06.914 --> 09:08.749
Southeastern Bantu region.

09:08.782 --> 09:12.019
I don't know--this spooky thing
called "slavery" happened,

09:12.052 --> 09:14.554
and my entire ethnic identity
was erased, so...

09:14.588 --> 09:18.225
(chuckling)

09:18.258 --> 09:20.327
Exactly.

09:24.732 --> 09:27.701
(light jazz music)

09:27.735 --> 09:34.642
*

09:37.510 --> 09:39.212
Where have you been?

09:39.246 --> 09:41.615
*

09:41.649 --> 09:43.550
You sure you want to...

09:43.583 --> 09:46.419
stay here the whole time?

09:46.453 --> 09:48.656
Yes.

09:48.689 --> 09:50.290
Are you sure, though?

09:50.323 --> 09:51.491
Earn.

09:51.524 --> 09:52.893
It doesn't feel like you're in

09:52.926 --> 09:53.994
a Spike Lee-directed

09:54.027 --> 09:55.929
"Eyes Wide Shut" right now?

09:55.963 --> 09:57.330
Hmm?

09:57.364 --> 09:59.900
*

09:59.933 --> 10:01.601
Are these slave ships?

10:01.635 --> 10:04.905
*

10:04.938 --> 10:06.473
Do you think
that I am happy here,

10:06.506 --> 10:09.609
having to prostitute myself
for an opportunity?

10:09.643 --> 10:11.478
Maybe.

10:11.511 --> 10:13.313
*

10:13.346 --> 10:15.248
Do you think that I'm happy
that I need you here

10:15.282 --> 10:17.317
in order to do that?

10:17.350 --> 10:19.519
Maybe.

10:19.552 --> 10:21.488
*

10:21.521 --> 10:23.356
Can we, for once,

10:23.390 --> 10:25.492
just pretend that we aren't
who we are?

10:25.525 --> 10:29.029
I mean, because we both know
that you're good at pretending.

10:29.062 --> 10:31.932
*

10:31.965 --> 10:33.166
Mm.

10:33.200 --> 10:37.637
*

10:37.671 --> 10:39.639
I prefer Craig Mack.
(laughing)

10:39.673 --> 10:42.375
If you--if you're gonna ask.

10:42.409 --> 10:44.277
I have to say this.

10:44.311 --> 10:47.114
You remind me of a character
in my new play.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.882
-Really?
-You do.

10:48.916 --> 10:50.884
-Oh. Mm.
-You really do.

10:50.918 --> 10:52.853
So comical.

10:52.886 --> 10:54.521
And handsome!

10:54.554 --> 10:56.056
-Oh!
-Ooh.

10:56.089 --> 10:58.892
Vanessa, you must be
in stitches every day,

10:58.926 --> 11:02.329
married to such a funny man.

11:02.362 --> 11:03.731
Mm.

11:03.764 --> 11:05.966
Well, as I always say,

11:05.999 --> 11:08.568
you have to laugh
to keep from crying.

11:08.601 --> 11:09.870
Yeah, she always says that.

11:09.903 --> 11:11.304
-Yes.
-You should slow down.

11:11.338 --> 11:13.974
We're going up at the Rialto
next month.

11:14.007 --> 11:15.976
My play,
"With Tail Between Legs."

11:16.009 --> 11:18.846
-Mm, good title.
-I wrote and directed it.

11:18.879 --> 11:20.848
It all takes place
at a strip club.

11:20.881 --> 11:24.251
Two gangbangers hold a pastor,
a drug dealer,

11:24.284 --> 11:26.586
and a pregnant teen hostage

11:26.619 --> 11:29.656
in the middle of
Hurricane Katrina.

11:29.689 --> 11:30.991
-That's a real situation.
-Mm! Sad.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.325
I'm glad
that story's being told.

11:32.359 --> 11:35.062
We've already adapted it
into a movie.

11:35.095 --> 11:37.865
-We would love to read that.
-Love.

11:37.898 --> 11:40.200
You know, and we were just
saying this the other day.

11:40.233 --> 11:41.201
(both stammering)

11:41.234 --> 11:42.936
both: The quality...

11:42.970 --> 11:45.105
-Of theater is just gone.
-Of theater is just not there.

11:45.138 --> 11:46.539
-It's just not there.
-Anymore.

11:46.573 --> 11:47.741
It's just not there.

11:47.775 --> 11:49.242
Well, let me
tell you something.

11:49.276 --> 11:53.046
Black Americans have to keep
fighting for good art.

11:53.080 --> 11:56.884
-A-men! Come--mm!
-We have to.

11:56.917 --> 11:58.351
both: Mm-hmm.

11:58.385 --> 11:59.552
-Hmm.
-(laughing)

11:59.586 --> 12:00.788
-We really do.
-Mm-hmm.

12:00.821 --> 12:02.422
(laughs)
Oh.

12:02.455 --> 12:04.057
Yeah, we really do.
Yep.

12:04.091 --> 12:06.259
-Ah.
-Is Vin Diesel black?

12:06.293 --> 12:07.260
*

12:07.294 --> 12:08.896
And all you got to do

12:08.929 --> 12:12.232
is give it up
to Jesus, playboy.

12:12.265 --> 12:14.367
Mm.

12:14.401 --> 12:16.103
I don't think
we really have the time

12:16.136 --> 12:18.205
to be church people.

12:18.238 --> 12:21.408
Yeah, between going to
Lottie's cello recitals

12:21.441 --> 12:24.144
and volunteering for at-risk
Filipino youth--

12:24.177 --> 12:25.712
See, there--
there you go again.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.881
Doubting!

12:27.915 --> 12:30.383
The devil has clouded

12:30.417 --> 12:33.653
your mind with doubt.

12:33.686 --> 12:35.823
Now, I'm not just a reverend
at some church.

12:35.856 --> 12:37.157
No.

12:37.190 --> 12:39.259
You see, I am a reverend

12:39.292 --> 12:41.128
at a mega-church.

12:41.161 --> 12:42.629
-Yeah, you said that--
-Yeah, you kind of say that--

12:42.662 --> 12:44.664
-Like twice already.
-Often.

12:44.697 --> 12:48.001
And I am gonna teach you both
about money management.

12:48.035 --> 12:50.470
And how to treat your woman.

12:50.503 --> 12:52.472
With respect.

12:52.505 --> 12:53.740
Hmm!

12:53.773 --> 12:57.845
Player, she wants a new you.

12:57.878 --> 13:00.814
She wants a saved man,
a man with a bangin' body

13:00.848 --> 13:04.184
and money in the bank.

13:04.217 --> 13:07.120
She's a pretty woman.

13:07.154 --> 13:09.589
Thank you.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.658
(laughing)

13:11.691 --> 13:15.162
-Yes.
-Yeah.

13:15.195 --> 13:17.697
What--what was your name?

13:17.730 --> 13:21.668
And what do you do, Earn?

13:21.701 --> 13:24.171
Nothing.

13:24.204 --> 13:27.140
(laughter)

13:29.176 --> 13:32.012
I mean that.
Van does everything.

13:32.045 --> 13:34.381
She works,
she raises our child,

13:34.414 --> 13:37.317
she's smarter than me,
better than me.

13:37.350 --> 13:39.286
I mean,
that's why I married her.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.288
She honestly doesn't get
the credit she deserves.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.956
I mean, ever.

13:42.990 --> 13:45.492
But that doesn't deter her
from being what she is,

13:45.525 --> 13:48.295
which is a mother,
a provider,

13:48.328 --> 13:51.231
and a partner.

13:51.264 --> 13:53.400
Gun to my head,

13:53.433 --> 13:55.802
I don't think I could even
look at another woman.

13:55.835 --> 13:58.805
(soft jazz music)

13:58.838 --> 14:01.141
*

14:01.174 --> 14:03.576
Vanessa, we're looking
for new members

14:03.610 --> 14:05.578
in our Jack and Jill
Atlanta chapter.

14:05.612 --> 14:07.414
You'd be a great fit.

14:07.447 --> 14:10.050
-We have a sickle cell--
-I'm so sorry, um...

14:10.083 --> 14:11.718
Will you excuse me?

14:11.751 --> 14:14.254
I...

14:14.287 --> 14:21.228
*

14:22.896 --> 14:25.232
She's fine.

14:28.601 --> 14:30.337
(sighs)

14:30.370 --> 14:32.372
(distant party chatter)

14:32.405 --> 14:34.207
(deep breath)

14:35.742 --> 14:37.377
What am I doing?

14:39.279 --> 14:42.215
(crying)

14:43.783 --> 14:45.618
What the fuck am I doing?

14:47.887 --> 14:50.590
*

14:50.623 --> 14:52.725
Hey.

14:52.759 --> 14:54.427
Hey.

14:54.461 --> 14:56.964
What's wrong?

14:56.997 --> 14:59.466
You're mean.

14:59.499 --> 15:00.900
I'm sorry.

15:02.669 --> 15:03.903
Don't be.

15:03.937 --> 15:06.106
I'm getting drunk.

15:06.139 --> 15:07.707
*

15:07.740 --> 15:11.744
Oh, people cannot stop talking
about you two.

15:11.778 --> 15:13.713
Hey, Earn.
Listen, I--

15:13.746 --> 15:15.482
I'm about to do
a poetry reading,

15:15.515 --> 15:17.117
and I tell you, I--

15:17.150 --> 15:18.986
I would love to have you
front and center

15:19.019 --> 15:21.254
and hear your thoughts.

15:21.288 --> 15:23.456
That sounds splendid.

15:26.126 --> 15:28.461
(lighter clicks)

15:28.495 --> 15:30.964
Seems like Earn and Craig
are hitting it off.

15:30.998 --> 15:34.167
(exhales)

15:34.201 --> 15:38.738
Craig, Craig, Craig, Craig.

15:38.771 --> 15:41.908
You don't think I know how crazy
my husband is?

15:41.941 --> 15:45.678
This whole "Black people
as a hobby" shit?

15:45.712 --> 15:49.849
Slam poetry?
"Martin" reruns?

15:49.882 --> 15:52.319
That nigga told
my 95-year-old grandmother

15:52.352 --> 15:54.621
that she was cooking
her collard greens wrong.

15:54.654 --> 15:57.557
(laughter)

15:58.791 --> 16:02.695
Well, girl, you married him.

16:02.729 --> 16:04.597
Yeah, I did.

16:04.631 --> 16:08.201
Can't eat if you don't
open your mouth.

16:08.235 --> 16:10.103
I get this big-ass house,
and he gets

16:10.137 --> 16:12.772
the black wife he always wanted.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.041
(chuckles)

16:14.074 --> 16:17.277
That's marriage.

16:17.310 --> 16:20.447
I like Craig.

16:20.480 --> 16:23.383
But I love my money.

16:25.185 --> 16:27.487
You did good.

16:27.520 --> 16:31.058
You married right, huh?

16:32.992 --> 16:34.694
Only way to stay fed
in this world

16:34.727 --> 16:36.329
is to keep the right company.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.834
Do you ever wish
that you actually

16:41.868 --> 16:45.038
had somebody to confide in?

16:45.072 --> 16:46.773
Hmm?

16:48.575 --> 16:49.676
Uh...

16:51.744 --> 16:53.580
It just seems really obvious

16:53.613 --> 16:57.016
that you don't think
Craig understands you.

16:57.050 --> 17:00.520
Are you sorry
that you can't have

17:00.553 --> 17:04.324
understanding and security?

17:04.357 --> 17:05.892
That reminds me of something.

17:05.925 --> 17:08.895
Something that Craig
actually made me read.

17:08.928 --> 17:11.064
It goes something like,

17:11.098 --> 17:14.901
"It's redundant to be both

17:14.934 --> 17:18.205
black and sorry
in the world."

17:18.238 --> 17:20.573
It's kind of like that.

17:20.607 --> 17:23.876
Hmm?

17:23.910 --> 17:27.547
That's from
"For Colored Girls."

17:27.580 --> 17:28.548
Oh.

17:28.581 --> 17:30.550
(laughter)

17:30.583 --> 17:33.753
Oh, ugh.

17:33.786 --> 17:34.887
Come on.

17:34.921 --> 17:37.357
Let's go back inside.

17:37.390 --> 17:40.860
Make sure our husbands
are behaving.

17:40.893 --> 17:44.231
(beatboxing)

17:44.264 --> 17:45.898
Jim Crow!

17:45.932 --> 17:48.901
Has the name of a man, but...

17:48.935 --> 17:51.138
is a ghost.

17:51.171 --> 17:52.739
I am a man.

17:52.772 --> 17:55.142
But Jim Crow

17:55.175 --> 17:57.944
is haunting me,

17:57.977 --> 18:01.248
like in that movie
"Poltergeist."

18:01.281 --> 18:03.883
And I am stuck

18:03.916 --> 18:06.553
in a television,

18:06.586 --> 18:08.988
like that little girl.

18:09.021 --> 18:11.424
Just get me out of here--

18:11.458 --> 18:13.226
I don't want to be

18:13.260 --> 18:15.995
in an electrical

18:16.028 --> 18:17.964
appliance.

18:17.997 --> 18:18.965
(scatting)

18:18.998 --> 18:20.400
(hollow echoing)

18:20.433 --> 18:22.802
Oh, but my point is moot.

18:22.835 --> 18:25.071
I have seen strange fruit

18:25.104 --> 18:27.574
loaded in this garden
of Eden...

18:27.607 --> 18:30.310
(whirring drowning out voices)

18:30.343 --> 18:31.611
-(slamming)
-Shit.

18:31.644 --> 18:33.012
-Oh, yes. They are here.
-Sorry.

18:33.045 --> 18:34.647
-It's okay.
-Sorry about that, man.

18:34.681 --> 18:37.584
-Feeding and feeding...
-Is that Red Bull and vodka?

18:37.617 --> 18:40.187
Well, yeah, but, uh, look,
don't tell my wife.

18:40.220 --> 18:41.521
I'm not supposed to have
too much caffeine.

18:41.554 --> 18:45.258
-Where did you get that?
-Bar.

18:45.292 --> 18:47.594
-I am a man, but...
-Bar.

18:47.627 --> 18:50.530
-Jim Crow is haunting me.
-Excuse me.

18:50.563 --> 18:52.199
Excuse me.

18:52.232 --> 18:53.666
Hey, you're Paper Boi's
dude, ain't you?

18:53.700 --> 18:56.503
-Can we get a picture?
-Uh...of--of me?

18:56.536 --> 18:59.306
I guess. You here.
He here?

18:59.339 --> 19:02.775
No, he's not--actually,
right now's not a good time.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.344
-(snorts)
-Hey.

19:04.377 --> 19:06.045
Well, can you pass Paper Boi
a message for me?

19:06.078 --> 19:07.514
Yeah, tell him
my sister likes him?

19:07.547 --> 19:08.881
-Okay.
-All right.

19:08.915 --> 19:10.149
-Here's a pair of her underwear.
-Whoa.

19:10.183 --> 19:11.551
-Give it to Paper Boi.
-Why? No.

19:11.584 --> 19:13.386
-Her name Tangela.
-Why are you--no.

19:13.420 --> 19:14.954
Why do you have
your sister's underwear?

19:14.987 --> 19:17.657
-(snorts) Never know, man.
-Never know what?

19:17.690 --> 19:20.327
No. Out. Out.
No, no. Go.

19:20.360 --> 19:21.794
If you want more food,

19:21.828 --> 19:24.030
Ramon will bring you
a to-go plate outside.

19:24.063 --> 19:25.332
-Earn.
-Okay, good-bye.

19:25.365 --> 19:26.799
Hey, man.
What'd you think?

19:26.833 --> 19:28.901
I would love any
honest criticism.

19:28.935 --> 19:30.637
-Uh-uh. No, no.
-Is everything okay?

19:30.670 --> 19:32.239
Yeah, we straight,
we were just

19:32.272 --> 19:34.140
saying "What's up"
to Paper Boi's boy.

19:34.173 --> 19:37.176
-(laughing)
-Paper Boi?

19:37.210 --> 19:39.746
(laughter)

19:39.779 --> 19:40.747
Oh, my...

19:40.780 --> 19:44.384
They must be confusing you.

19:44.417 --> 19:46.319
-That's funny.
-Paper Boi.

19:46.353 --> 19:48.755
-Confused with someone else.
-Someone else.

19:48.788 --> 19:51.023
Paper Boi!
I knew it!

19:51.057 --> 19:52.559
I knew
I knew you from somewhere.

19:52.592 --> 19:54.894
I had such a special feeling
about you, Earn.

19:54.927 --> 19:59.098
Honey--honey,
Earn is Paper Boi's manager.

19:59.131 --> 20:00.867
Oh, sorry.

20:00.900 --> 20:05.004
A very, very talented
young rapper.

20:05.037 --> 20:08.241
Oh, you manage rap?

20:08.275 --> 20:09.409
(clears throat)

20:09.442 --> 20:12.044
Yes.
I manage rap.

20:12.078 --> 20:15.214
There is nothing wrong
with earning money

20:15.248 --> 20:17.284
doing something with rap,
it's fine.

20:17.317 --> 20:19.852
Well, it's not just
about money.

20:19.886 --> 20:22.021
You know it's--you know,
he--he's my cousin.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.089
-He's family.
-Yeah.

20:23.122 --> 20:24.857
Honey, you're missing the point.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.726
It's not about money.
This is bigger than money.

20:26.759 --> 20:28.928
Paper Boi is underground.

20:28.961 --> 20:30.763
I've been following Paper Boi
since the start.

20:30.797 --> 20:32.098
That's how I knew you!

20:32.131 --> 20:33.766
I mean, since the shooting?

20:33.800 --> 20:36.303
Your pictures were everywhere.

20:36.336 --> 20:39.272
Shooting?

20:39.306 --> 20:41.908
Well, you aren't gonna
shoot up this party,

20:41.941 --> 20:44.043
are you, Earn?

20:44.076 --> 20:48.448
Mm...no,
I wasn't planning on it.

20:48.481 --> 20:50.550
(laughing)

20:50.583 --> 20:51.884
I'm kidding.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.453
I get it.

20:53.486 --> 20:55.121
Can't choose your family, huh?

20:55.154 --> 20:57.256
Every decent person has at least

20:57.290 --> 21:00.159
one trifling thug in the family.

21:00.192 --> 21:01.127
(chuckles)

21:06.265 --> 21:08.835
Oh, honey, let's go
say "hello" to--

21:08.868 --> 21:11.103
Eh, no.
I'm sorry.

21:11.137 --> 21:13.773
This is whack.
This is--this is whack.

21:13.806 --> 21:15.642
-Babe, please.
-No, no.

21:15.675 --> 21:17.777
Okay, like, this isn't
real life, okay?

21:17.810 --> 21:20.447
This--this party is dumb.
She's dumb.

21:20.480 --> 21:22.682
This is all dumb.
You know that, Van.

21:22.715 --> 21:24.351
-This is dumb.
-Okay. I'm sorry.

21:24.384 --> 21:26.252
-This is dumb.
-We're gonna head out, right?

21:26.285 --> 21:27.920
And you know what?

21:27.954 --> 21:30.590
Stop stunting on me
about my culture.

21:30.623 --> 21:32.792
Like, I'm not gonna
go back to Africa

21:32.825 --> 21:34.861
and find my roots,
because you know what?

21:34.894 --> 21:36.629
-I'm sorry.
-I'm fucking broke, dude.

21:36.663 --> 21:38.097
-I'm broke.
-It's my bad.

21:38.130 --> 21:39.699
-No, don't do that.
-Hey.

21:39.732 --> 21:42.101
Don't "my bad" it.
And stop being so likable.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.670
Stop being so likable,
like, I get--don't--

21:43.703 --> 21:45.705
and don't be like
"I understand"--

21:45.738 --> 21:47.173
-Earn, we're heading out now.
-Because you don't understand.

21:47.206 --> 21:48.475
-We're going now.
-Like, I'm--

21:48.508 --> 21:50.209
-Good night.
-For your hospitality.

21:50.242 --> 21:52.612
Okay, well, we--we'd love
to see you soon.

21:52.645 --> 21:54.146
Thank you very much for coming.

21:54.180 --> 21:55.548
-Mm-hmm.
-Good night.

21:55.582 --> 21:57.149
-Mm-hmm.
-Happy Juneteenth.

21:57.183 --> 21:58.818
-So weird.
-Great party. Let's go, babe.

21:58.851 --> 22:00.753
So weird.
This is a weird place.

22:05.892 --> 22:08.828
(engine rumbling)

22:15.034 --> 22:17.904
I'll call her in the morning
and apologize.

22:17.937 --> 22:18.871
I'm sorry.
