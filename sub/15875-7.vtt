00:04.037 --> 00:05.539
Hey, what are you doing?

00:05.539 --> 00:07.241
Looking at bridal magazines.

00:07.241 --> 00:08.709
Oh.

00:08.709 --> 00:11.078
I know.

00:11.078 --> 00:12.813
How exciting is all this?

00:12.813 --> 00:14.848
It's so exciting.

00:14.848 --> 00:16.517
I wonder why they don't
have men magazines.

00:16.517 --> 00:18.085
-You know why?
-Why?

00:18.085 --> 00:19.186
Because most guys don't care.

00:19.186 --> 00:19.987
That's sad.

00:19.987 --> 00:21.555
[LAUGHS]

00:21.555 --> 00:23.257
The wedding is a
couple months away.

00:23.257 --> 00:26.627
So I'm reading like all
the things to do, don't do.

00:26.627 --> 00:29.496
It is so much fun and I figured
this is a once in a lifetime

00:29.496 --> 00:32.232
thing so I'm going to
go full force into it.

00:32.232 --> 00:33.367
We have to decide
how we're going

00:33.367 --> 00:35.669
to kiss on our wedding day.

00:35.669 --> 00:39.139
I think it should be like this.

00:39.139 --> 00:40.073
Ew.

00:40.073 --> 00:42.342
No.

00:42.342 --> 00:43.744
Bryan.

00:43.744 --> 00:47.748
Like, I want it to be so people
go, oh, they're so in love.

[LOUD KISSING]

00:53.921 --> 00:55.222
Bryan.

00:55.222 --> 00:56.123
You have to be serious.

00:56.123 --> 00:57.324
This is a special moment.

00:57.324 --> 01:01.094
Or it could be like a
Nattie TJ kiss like a-- Ew.

01:01.094 --> 01:03.530
That seems like
we're not in love.

01:03.530 --> 01:07.367
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:15.676 --> 01:18.412
I love you and I'll call
and text you in a little bit.

01:18.412 --> 01:19.212
OK?

01:19.212 --> 01:20.113
MAN (ON PHONE): All right.

01:20.113 --> 01:20.914
I love you, beautiful.

01:20.914 --> 01:21.815
Bye.

01:21.815 --> 01:22.616
Hi.

01:22.616 --> 01:24.484
What's wrong?

01:24.484 --> 01:27.387
You look like gloom and doom.

01:27.387 --> 01:30.324
I was just getting ready
and a couple of my friends

01:30.324 --> 01:32.826
just texted me, like, oh my
gosh, have you seen the news?

01:32.826 --> 01:34.628
Have you heard?

01:34.628 --> 01:37.831
Another one of my
exes just got engaged.

01:37.831 --> 01:40.200
Oh my gosh.

01:40.200 --> 01:41.868
I'm sorry.

01:41.868 --> 01:45.238
And it's almost like every
time I'm out of a relationship,

01:45.238 --> 01:47.541
it's the next girl after me.

01:47.541 --> 01:51.278
And, like, I just had
my birthday and I'm 30.

01:53.880 --> 01:55.749
And, I don't know, I
shouldn't be annoyed.

01:55.749 --> 01:57.384
That's weird, right?

01:57.384 --> 01:59.886
Because I still don't have
feelings for any of them.

01:59.886 --> 02:03.757
It's just a reminder
that, like, I'm single.

02:03.757 --> 02:05.425
Yes.

02:05.425 --> 02:07.961
SUMMER: My ex and I we're
together for almost two years.

02:07.961 --> 02:08.762
I don't know.

02:08.762 --> 02:10.896
I'm just feeling
lonelier than ever.

02:10.896 --> 02:12.299
And, sure, I have a
great career and a lot

02:12.299 --> 02:13.233
of things going for me.

02:13.233 --> 02:15.769
But I have no one
to share it with.

02:15.769 --> 02:17.471
I don't even have
any prospects.

02:17.471 --> 02:20.774
Like, I don't even have anyone
on the radar, like, on the map

02:20.774 --> 02:21.575
at all.

02:21.575 --> 02:22.376
Well, you never know.

02:22.376 --> 02:25.379
Someone could just, like,
pop up out of nowhere.

02:25.379 --> 02:27.514
Or Jonathan can just
hook me up with someone.

02:27.514 --> 02:30.717

hook you up with someone.

Cuz.

Cuz why?

02:54.741 --> 02:56.610
You haven't been reminding
me to take my pills.

03:01.048 --> 03:03.316
Why I got to remind to
take your pills, Tri?

03:03.316 --> 03:07.087
Because I forget.

birth control pills,

03:08.889 --> 03:12.426
but, uh, it's just a hassle.

03:12.426 --> 03:14.995
Well, if you just use a
love sleeve, than we wouldn't

03:14.995 --> 03:15.862
have this problem either.

No, man.

It's too much to put on.

No, what's going
to be too much is

Don't say that.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.842

03:28.842 --> 03:29.643
Oh, I know.

03:29.643 --> 03:30.444
I already know.

03:30.444 --> 03:32.112
I know how it works.

03:32.112 --> 03:34.047
Yeah, I'm cool with
the two little Jonnies

03:34.047 --> 03:35.115
you have already.

03:35.115 --> 03:38.452
We can wait awhile for
our little Jonnies.

03:38.452 --> 03:40.587
NAOMI: Jon has two
beautiful kids.

03:40.587 --> 03:42.923
And he loves them to death.

03:42.923 --> 03:46.326
I know he'd be a great
dad for our kids, as well.

03:46.326 --> 03:47.794
But we just got married.

03:47.794 --> 03:50.897
I want me and Jon to
enjoy being newly weds.

03:50.897 --> 03:53.033
Not only that, we
both are almost

03:53.033 --> 03:54.234
at the heights of our career.

03:54.234 --> 03:57.137
And I just can't
risk getting pregnant

with these outfits?

04:15.889 --> 04:18.225

little early yesterday

04:18.225 --> 04:19.593
and I went to the thrift store.

04:19.593 --> 04:20.726

04:20.726 --> 04:21.528
Yes.

didn't get me one.

cute style though.

-Yeah.

like that dress, girl.

to you by a text message

decided to text me

of my ex-boyfriends is engaged.

I'm not trying to get pregnant

04:51.091 --> 04:52.325
or get married right away.

with my job and what I do.

04:57.964 --> 05:01.101
But I also think it's stopping
me from meeting someone.

05:01.101 --> 05:02.736
Being the only single
girl in the Diva's

05:02.736 --> 05:06.072

think, what's wrong with me?

05:06.072 --> 05:08.708
I feel like with this job, you
need to find the right person.

05:08.708 --> 05:09.643
You need to find that right.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.244

in front of her face.

05:11.244 --> 05:12.045

No.

05:12.846 --> 05:13.713

around with people at work.

to, I would want like you.

I have to be sure that
it could be something.

kiss him and I had to kiss him.

06:10.937 --> 06:11.738

on him and had to--

08:32.445 --> 08:34.047
We should hang out or
something this week.

08:34.047 --> 08:35.115
OK.
Yeah.

08:35.115 --> 08:36.383
Maybe like go to
dinner or something.

08:36.383 --> 08:36.816
Yeah.

08:36.816 --> 08:38.751
Come down to the beach and
there is a few restaurants

08:38.751 --> 08:40.086
off the main strip right there.

08:40.086 --> 08:40.886
Oh, my gosh.

08:40.886 --> 08:42.087
Your hair is like
dripping out here.

08:42.087 --> 08:42.989
I know. [INAUDIBLE] OK.

08:42.989 --> 08:44.624
Well, I'm going
to put a shirt on.

08:44.624 --> 08:47.427
No, you shouldn't
put a shirt on.

08:47.427 --> 08:49.596
We're good working
business partners

08:49.596 --> 08:50.497
maybe something's there.

08:50.497 --> 08:51.297
I don't know.

08:51.297 --> 08:52.999
You never know until
you try, right?

08:52.999 --> 08:53.800
OK, sounds good.

08:53.800 --> 08:54.567
Looking forward to it.

08:54.567 --> 08:55.368
Bye.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.310
Oh, my goodness.

09:04.310 --> 09:05.612
I feel like it's going to snow.

09:05.612 --> 09:06.946
Welcome to Serendipity Bridal.

09:06.946 --> 09:08.148
How can we help you today?

09:08.148 --> 09:10.383
Hi, I'm Brie and I
have an appointment.

09:10.383 --> 09:13.286
BRIE: The minute I got engaged
in Big Sur, I was like,

09:13.286 --> 09:14.954
I need to start dress shopping.

09:14.954 --> 09:15.755
Let me show you these.

09:15.755 --> 09:17.290
These are the ones that
we had pulled for you.

09:17.290 --> 09:18.558
These are some Katie May pieces.

09:18.558 --> 09:19.392
Oh, those are beautiful.

09:19.392 --> 09:20.360
These are really pretty.

09:20.360 --> 09:24.030
Just peek through and you'll
see satins, lace, bead work.

09:24.030 --> 09:25.698
Actually, I'll try this one.

09:25.698 --> 09:27.067
Well, should we start
with these and then

09:27.067 --> 09:28.501
we'll go into the next?
-Yes.

09:28.501 --> 09:29.969
My sister isn't here yet.

09:29.969 --> 09:31.771
And I'm a little bummed
out because her opinion

09:31.771 --> 09:33.206
means the most to me.

09:33.206 --> 09:36.176
And she's my sister, I want her
there when I put on the one.

09:39.879 --> 09:40.680
Oh.

09:40.680 --> 09:41.481
Oh.

09:41.481 --> 09:43.383
It is stunning.

09:43.383 --> 09:44.884
So pretty.

09:44.884 --> 09:46.619
This is, I said, very much
Nicole's wedding dress.

09:46.619 --> 09:47.387
Yes.

09:47.387 --> 09:48.421
So Nicole.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.090
It looks amazing on you.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.558
Oh, thank you.

09:51.558 --> 09:55.428
Well, we're just going to
have to make John to Nicole.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.597
Then she can wear that one.

09:57.597 --> 09:58.398
Amazing.

09:58.398 --> 10:00.600
Oh, my gosh.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.868
It is stunning.

10:01.868 --> 10:02.936
Ready?

10:02.936 --> 10:04.003
Yes.

10:04.003 --> 10:04.871
Oh, my goodness.

10:07.540 --> 10:10.043
It is beautiful.

10:10.043 --> 10:12.979
Oh, I wish Nicole was here.

10:12.979 --> 10:13.880
I know.

10:13.880 --> 10:14.747
She's missing out.

10:14.747 --> 10:17.650
Oh, Brie, I love it.

10:17.650 --> 10:18.585
Me, too.

10:18.585 --> 10:19.652
Do you have the feeling?

10:19.652 --> 10:21.121
I do.

10:21.121 --> 10:24.524
BRIE: This dress fits
my body like a glove.

10:24.524 --> 10:27.127
I just put it on and I
don't want to take it off.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.895
And I'm thinking to
myself, this can't happen.

10:28.895 --> 10:30.330
Nikki is not here yet.

10:30.330 --> 10:31.131
Wow.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.233
You'll put some
of the hair over.

10:33.233 --> 10:35.468
Kills me that
Nicole is not here.

10:35.468 --> 10:36.603
She's on her way, isn't she?

10:36.603 --> 10:37.537
I think.

10:37.537 --> 10:38.605
Her loss.

10:38.605 --> 10:39.405
All right.

10:39.405 --> 10:40.707
Well, should we do more dresses?

10:40.707 --> 10:41.508
I know.

10:41.508 --> 10:43.510
I honestly don't think
anything's going to compare.

10:43.510 --> 10:45.945
So if anything, it'll
solidify that this is it.

10:45.945 --> 10:46.746
That's true.

10:46.746 --> 10:47.547
Exactly.

10:47.547 --> 10:50.250
At least we can have
fun and do it up.

10:50.250 --> 10:51.851
Nicole!

10:51.851 --> 10:53.319
You need a mimosa?

10:53.319 --> 10:55.355
Yeah, I'll definitely
take a mimosa.

10:55.355 --> 10:58.191
So, gosh, we haven't
seen you in so long.

10:58.191 --> 10:58.992
I know.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.527
Congratulations
on the new house.

11:00.527 --> 11:01.327
I know.

11:01.327 --> 11:02.228
I'm so excited.

11:02.228 --> 11:03.029
Is it beautiful?

11:03.029 --> 11:04.864
It's gorgeous.

11:04.864 --> 11:08.635
So are you OK with all this?

11:08.635 --> 11:09.869
Oh, yeah.

11:09.869 --> 11:10.770
Yeah?

11:10.770 --> 11:11.571
Because the last--

11:11.571 --> 11:13.039
You guys ready for this one?

11:13.039 --> 11:13.907
It's a fun one.

11:13.907 --> 11:15.308
Yes.

11:15.308 --> 11:17.177
It is fun.

11:17.177 --> 11:18.978
It is fun.

11:18.978 --> 11:20.113
What were you
guys talking about?

11:20.113 --> 11:22.882
I could hear all these little--

11:22.882 --> 11:24.083
Brie, it's about you right now.

11:29.689 --> 11:32.358
I heard about this
birth control implant.

11:32.358 --> 11:33.526
Have you talked to Jon?

11:33.526 --> 11:37.330
It's my body, not Jon's.

11:37.330 --> 11:39.065
I think being my
Maid of Honor you

11:39.065 --> 11:40.466
need to be more respectable.

11:40.466 --> 11:41.234
Ew, no.

11:41.234 --> 11:42.802
I could look like me.

11:42.802 --> 11:44.671
But it's not your wedding.

11:53.613 --> 11:54.881
-Hi, guys.
-Hi.

11:54.881 --> 11:56.349
Can I get a picture
real quick, please?

11:56.349 --> 11:57.317
Yeah.

11:57.317 --> 11:58.785
Thank you so much.

11:58.785 --> 12:01.554
You're welcome.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.022
See you later, Ariane.

12:03.022 --> 12:05.959
Bye!

12:05.959 --> 12:07.627
I'm sure Nadia
will be nice and hot

12:07.627 --> 12:10.029
when she sees Lana today on TV.

12:10.029 --> 12:10.830
Who is Lana?

12:10.830 --> 12:11.764
She's a new girl from NXT.

12:11.764 --> 12:12.565
Why?

12:12.565 --> 12:13.433
Because she's blonde?

12:13.433 --> 12:14.234
Yeah.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.001
And you blonde.

12:15.001 --> 12:17.303
She might be hot with you, too.

12:17.303 --> 12:18.204
[LAUGHS]

12:18.204 --> 12:19.105
Girl, I'm black.

12:19.105 --> 12:23.743
--[INAUDIBLE] I forgot to
take my darn pills again.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.278
You need to stop doing
that because you're

12:25.278 --> 12:27.247
about to have a little baby.

12:27.247 --> 12:28.081
Hell no, I'm not.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.382
[INAUDIBLE]

12:29.382 --> 12:30.750
[INAUDIBLE] No.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.518
No little jardies yet.

12:32.518 --> 12:35.054
But I got to get this
together because--

12:35.054 --> 12:36.055
[SIGH]

12:36.055 --> 12:37.590
No, I feel you though
because I forget mine.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.325
Do you take yours on time?

12:39.325 --> 12:41.294
I'm not on it.

12:41.294 --> 12:42.395
What?

12:42.395 --> 12:44.097
Oh, my god.

12:44.097 --> 12:44.931
So what you going to do.

12:44.931 --> 12:47.033
One of those little
Jonathan's get up in there.

12:47.033 --> 12:47.834
I don't know.

12:47.834 --> 12:49.002
You got to do something, too.

12:49.002 --> 12:51.204
I heard about this implant.

12:51.204 --> 12:53.306
It goes like in your
arm under your skin

12:53.306 --> 12:55.508
but it lasts for
like three years.

12:55.508 --> 12:56.376
In your skin?

12:56.376 --> 12:57.176
What?

12:57.176 --> 12:58.678
NAOMI: I've done some
research on this newer

12:58.678 --> 12:59.746
birth control method.

12:59.746 --> 13:02.649
I don't know 100% how
this process works.

13:02.649 --> 13:05.585
All I know is it goes under
the arm and you cannot

13:05.585 --> 13:07.453
get pregnant for three years.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.722
I figure with that I don't
have to stress about it anymore.

13:09.722 --> 13:10.623
I don't have to worry.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.759
I'm not like freaking
out when I'm late.

13:12.759 --> 13:14.227
Because eventually
I'm going to get got.

13:14.227 --> 13:14.727
Yes.

13:14.727 --> 13:15.995
Like, that's just
a matter of time.

13:15.995 --> 13:17.130
Yeah.
You need to do something.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.164
Have you talked with Jon?

13:18.164 --> 13:18.965
What does he think?

13:18.965 --> 13:21.234
No, I haven't really--
I've been thinking

13:21.234 --> 13:22.535
about it just recently.

13:22.535 --> 13:24.203
I haven't really
discussed it with him.

13:24.203 --> 13:25.538
And I haven't made
my mind up about it.

13:25.538 --> 13:27.206
I think I need to do a
little more research on it.

13:27.206 --> 13:28.941
But I think you
should to him about it.

13:28.941 --> 13:29.742
You know what I mean?

13:29.742 --> 13:30.910
To see what he thinks, too.

13:30.910 --> 13:33.279
But my thing is,
if I get pregnant,

13:33.279 --> 13:36.616
that's going to turn my
world upside down, not Jon's.

13:36.616 --> 13:37.950
When the time is right, though.

13:37.950 --> 13:38.751
Yeah.

13:38.751 --> 13:40.720
I just feel like, it's not
like I'm getting my tubes tied

13:40.720 --> 13:44.023
or completely taking
the option away.

13:44.023 --> 13:45.725
I just don't want no
surprise right now.

13:45.725 --> 13:46.893
OK, then when you
don't tell him--

13:46.893 --> 13:48.494
I think you need to
have the convo, for sure.

13:48.494 --> 13:51.264
But how bad will it be if I
tell him, he tells me not to,

13:51.264 --> 13:52.231
and then I go do it anyway.

13:52.231 --> 13:55.401
I'd rather ask for
forgiveness than permission.

13:55.401 --> 13:56.302
Just get it done now.

13:56.302 --> 13:57.603
That way you don't
have to do it later.

13:57.603 --> 13:58.404
But I know Jon.

13:58.404 --> 14:00.306
He's so, like, whatever
happens happens.

14:00.306 --> 14:01.174
We'll deal with it.

14:01.174 --> 14:04.444
And he does want kids right now.

14:04.444 --> 14:07.847
I want kids eventually.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.115
A lot of them.

14:09.115 --> 14:10.116
Multiple.

14:10.116 --> 14:11.184
As many as I can have.

14:11.184 --> 14:13.219
But just not right now.

14:13.219 --> 14:16.122
I just look at it this
way-- it's my body

14:16.122 --> 14:20.626
and I just think it should be
my decision regardless of what

14:20.626 --> 14:23.262
we agree or don't agree upon.

14:23.262 --> 14:25.398
But if you guys
love each other.

14:25.398 --> 14:27.767
Girl, he will lick
your dirty [BLEEP], OK?

14:27.767 --> 14:29.135
Jon loves you.

14:29.135 --> 14:31.537
Girl, you looking
through our window?

14:31.537 --> 14:34.006
[LAUGHING]

14:35.007 --> 14:36.008
[CHEERING]

14:36.008 --> 14:37.677
ANNOUNCER: Welcome
back to main event.

14:37.677 --> 14:38.478
AJ!

14:38.478 --> 14:39.946
Oh!

14:39.946 --> 14:41.447
AJ blasting Natalia.

14:47.353 --> 14:48.354
But wait a minute.

14:48.354 --> 14:51.324
The Funkadactyls, Naomi and
Cameron, coming to the rescue.

14:51.324 --> 14:52.291
Oh, man.

14:52.291 --> 14:54.394
Wiping out Tamina Snuka.

14:54.394 --> 14:58.297
I have been working so hard
to get a shot at the title.

14:58.297 --> 15:00.700
Lately, my career
is on the rise and

15:00.700 --> 15:02.068
things are going great for me.

15:05.972 --> 15:08.608
I definitely think it's time
for someone other than AJ

15:08.608 --> 15:10.777
to be the Diva's champion.

15:10.777 --> 15:12.311
And that someone is me.

15:12.311 --> 15:13.780
ANNOUNCER: I tell
you you what, I think

15:13.780 --> 15:15.114
we're seeing somebody
that might finally

15:15.114 --> 15:17.917
unseat the WWE Diva's champion.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.685
And things are heating up.

15:25.625 --> 15:26.626
Hi, I'm Amber.

15:26.626 --> 15:27.427
Nice to meet you.

15:27.427 --> 15:28.861
HI, Nicole.

15:28.861 --> 15:30.463
Nice to meet you.

15:30.463 --> 15:32.365
So I'm the one who made the
appointment for us to try

15:32.365 --> 15:33.533
on some bridesmaid dresses.
-OK.

15:33.533 --> 15:34.333
Sounds good.

15:34.333 --> 15:36.903
I've got everything ready
in the back for you.

15:36.903 --> 15:38.971
I feel as if I'm
the Maid of Honor,

15:38.971 --> 15:41.774
so I deserve maybe something
red because I love red.

15:41.774 --> 15:42.575
It's my color.

15:42.575 --> 15:44.577
You know, maybe a
little bit of cleavage.

15:44.577 --> 15:46.078
You know, just so
people know, like, hey,

15:46.078 --> 15:46.879
I'm the Maid of Honor.

15:49.115 --> 15:50.183
Yeah.
-Nicole.

15:50.183 --> 15:50.983
Oh, my god.

15:50.983 --> 15:51.784
I love this.

15:51.784 --> 15:54.287
No, it's not what
I was thinking.

15:54.287 --> 15:56.823
This is what a
Maid of Honor wears.

15:56.823 --> 15:58.224
Let's try the next one on.

15:58.224 --> 16:00.927
I really want my Maid of
Honor and my bridesmaids

16:00.927 --> 16:03.463
to be just so elegant
and beautiful.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.331
Nikki is trying
on these dresses.

16:05.331 --> 16:06.566
They're tight fitting.

16:06.566 --> 16:07.867
Her boobs are everywhere.

16:07.867 --> 16:10.436
This is not the look I
wanted for my wedding.

16:10.436 --> 16:12.171
Similar to the
color you wanted.

16:12.171 --> 16:14.674
I still think
that's a lot of boob.

16:14.674 --> 16:16.242
What do you mean a lot of boob?

16:16.242 --> 16:17.877
I think being my Maid
of Honor I think you

16:17.877 --> 16:20.546
need to be more respectable.

16:20.546 --> 16:22.181
People will probably
be looking at you more

16:22.181 --> 16:23.883
and you should look a
little more conservative.

16:23.883 --> 16:24.684
Ew, no.

16:24.684 --> 16:26.652
I could look like me.

16:26.652 --> 16:28.488
But it's not your wedding.

16:28.488 --> 16:29.989
I've heard about
this about brides.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.858
Trying to cover up
the bridesmaids.

16:31.858 --> 16:34.227
Make them look frumpy and ugly.

16:34.227 --> 16:35.895
Like, what are you doing to me?

16:35.895 --> 16:36.729
No.

16:36.729 --> 16:37.530
OK.

16:40.266 --> 16:41.067
See?

16:41.067 --> 16:41.868
That's pretty.

16:45.404 --> 16:47.573
My day, right?

16:47.573 --> 16:48.374
Your day.

[SIRENS]

17:05.258 --> 17:08.560
I'm going to the OB/GYN
today with my mom to get

17:08.560 --> 17:10.195
this birth control implant.

17:10.195 --> 17:12.031
I have done all of my
research and I just

17:12.031 --> 17:15.667
think this is the best
option for me right now.

17:15.667 --> 17:18.637
Well, it's a pretty
normal procedure.

17:18.637 --> 17:20.039
Hopefully everything
will go well.

17:20.039 --> 17:22.241
We'll be in and out.

17:22.241 --> 17:24.911
But it'll be a lot
more convenient.

17:24.911 --> 17:27.547
Definitely for me.

17:27.547 --> 17:28.981
Yeah.

17:28.981 --> 17:33.953
I mean, I haven't told Jon
where I'm going this morning.

17:33.953 --> 17:37.356
So hopefully when he finds out,
he won't be too upset about it.

17:41.127 --> 17:42.295
He's not aware?

[BLOWS RASPBERRY]

17:47.233 --> 17:48.901
I need you to help me with
the bridesmaid dresses.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.403
Do you think I should
do a band or a DJ?

17:51.203 --> 17:52.038

Oh, Nicole.
Come here real quick.

New rule.

17:54.340 --> 17:56.208
No wedding talk.

17:56.208 --> 17:57.910
I like having you around.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.579
If you want to stay
longer, you can.

17:59.579 --> 18:02.415
I feel like we're
flirting back and forth.

18:02.415 --> 18:03.849
I have that butterfly feeling.

18:14.327 --> 18:15.895
Is this the entrance?

18:15.895 --> 18:16.696
Yes.

18:16.696 --> 18:17.930
I'm at the OB/GYN.

18:17.930 --> 18:20.299
And I'm a little nervous about
getting the procedure done.

18:20.299 --> 18:24.937
But I know 100% that
this is what I want.

18:24.937 --> 18:28.274
Jon just texted me
asking where I'm at.

18:28.274 --> 18:31.210
He's going to be upset.

18:31.210 --> 18:34.046
Ma, you're not
helping me right now.

18:34.046 --> 18:35.314
I'm just being truthful.

18:37.850 --> 18:40.219
I know how important it
is for Jon to have kids.

18:40.219 --> 18:42.121
I know he'd be a great dad.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.323
But I just want to
do a few more things

18:44.323 --> 18:46.258
before I start having babies.

18:46.258 --> 18:50.896
Because I truly believe I
will be the Diva's champion.

18:50.896 --> 18:53.199
I wish they'd hurry up so
I can get this over with.

it to be a rush job.

I think we're ready
to get started.

19:03.709 --> 19:04.510
OK.

19:04.510 --> 19:06.379
So she's opening
up the device now.

19:06.379 --> 19:08.080
It comes in an inserter.

19:08.080 --> 19:10.082
So we're going to put
this in your left arm.

19:10.082 --> 19:13.953
What you're going to feel
now is a little bee sting.

19:13.953 --> 19:17.723
But just that little rod is
going to stay in your arm.

19:17.723 --> 19:20.760
So I want you to tell
me if you feel that.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.194
-No.
-OK.

19:22.194 --> 19:23.029
Here we go.

Not bad.

little pressure here.

implant but you can feel it.

So I just hope Jon doesn't like
grab or try to feel on my arm.

So we're going to
keep some pressure

19:46.419 --> 19:48.688
on this just for 24 hours.

going to want to know

19:51.157 --> 19:53.125
why is your arm wrapped.

a discussion with him today.

I mean, you need to get
out more and do stuff.

20:13.546 --> 20:14.346
Yeah.

thought you a her girlfriend.

What do you mean?

20:26.726 --> 20:27.960
I didn't know you were single.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.261
I'm always single.

20:29.261 --> 20:30.463
I'll take whatever I can get.

you're such a good catch.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.500

that you're getting old

20:37.069 --> 20:37.870

only natural for every girl

No, I actually don't
even know what that is.

you got nice legs.

say is your five year plan?

understand your career

you go through.

23:56.635 --> 23:57.503
[BLEEP]
-All right.

23:57.503 --> 23:58.304
What?

24:02.474 --> 24:03.409
Let me do my front squat.

24:03.409 --> 24:04.209
I know.

24:04.209 --> 24:06.378
But I was thinking,
like, obviously you need

24:06.378 --> 24:07.913
to help me like who do I mix.

24:07.913 --> 24:10.449
Like maybe married couples with
married couples or something.

24:10.449 --> 24:11.250
I don't know.

24:11.250 --> 24:12.284
I'll think about it.

24:12.284 --> 24:13.385
I did my three.

24:13.385 --> 24:14.186
All right.

24:14.186 --> 24:15.654
Give me one second.

24:15.654 --> 24:16.455
Nicole.

24:16.455 --> 24:17.256
What?

24:17.256 --> 24:18.724
It better be about
a front squat.

24:18.724 --> 24:19.525
No.

Excuse me.

Any time we're in the
gym no wedding talk.

I just asked you
a simple question.

24:28.701 --> 24:32.104
You've asked me 10 and they
all deal with your wedding.

24:32.104 --> 24:33.605

a crazy schedule

24:33.605 --> 24:35.074
and we're always on the road.

24:35.074 --> 24:37.409
We never get to talk
about personal things.

24:37.409 --> 24:40.646
So I'm asking Nikki about the
wedding and wanting her advice

24:40.646 --> 24:42.581
and she snaps at me.

24:42.581 --> 24:43.415
Rude.

24:43.415 --> 24:45.451
What do you think the guys
want to just nonstop talk

24:45.451 --> 24:46.318
about wedding stuff?

24:46.318 --> 24:47.419
No.

24:47.419 --> 24:49.288
I was having a
conversation with Bryan

24:49.288 --> 24:53.025
about floral arrangements before
you guys ruined everything.

24:53.025 --> 24:54.893
Yeah.

24:54.893 --> 24:57.663
Oh, [BLEEP].

24:57.663 --> 24:58.831
Did she just die over there?

24:58.831 --> 25:00.065
I [BLEEP] up.

25:00.065 --> 25:02.334
Well, if you start focusing on
your snatch and not the wedding

25:02.334 --> 25:03.135
stuff.

25:03.135 --> 25:05.871
Did you just tell your
sister to focus on her snatch?

25:05.871 --> 25:06.672
Yeah.

25:11.977 --> 25:13.912
SUMMER: That was fun.

25:13.912 --> 25:16.115
I got to admit that
when I first pulled up

25:16.115 --> 25:17.383
I was going to kill you.

25:17.383 --> 25:19.985
I was impressed that you
drank the shots with all

25:19.985 --> 25:20.886
the random folks there.

25:20.886 --> 25:22.521
That was like a
double shot, too.

25:22.521 --> 25:23.622
And I didn't even flinch.

25:23.622 --> 25:24.990
I didn't even have a chaser.
-Yeah.

25:24.990 --> 25:25.791
Respect.

25:25.791 --> 25:27.860
That was pretty rugged.

25:27.860 --> 25:29.228
Your hair is getting long, huh?

25:29.228 --> 25:30.029
Yeah.

25:32.398 --> 25:33.866
You look good tonight.

25:33.866 --> 25:34.967
Thank you.

25:34.967 --> 25:38.504
So would you ever do
that again with me?

25:38.504 --> 25:39.405
Sure.

25:39.405 --> 25:41.507
That was a good time.

25:41.507 --> 25:43.542
Honestly, I knew you would have
a good time, but you didn't.

25:43.542 --> 25:44.443
I had fun.

25:44.443 --> 25:45.644
I don't have like
a stick up my ass.

25:45.644 --> 25:47.446
I was impressed.

25:47.446 --> 25:49.114
I mean, it's still
not that late.

25:49.114 --> 25:51.016
What time is your
pool open until.

25:51.016 --> 25:54.686
We can get in there
any time, I think.

25:54.686 --> 25:55.721
We?

25:55.721 --> 25:56.922
If you want to.

25:56.922 --> 25:57.823
[LAUGHING]

25:57.823 --> 25:58.624
Right?

26:02.861 --> 26:03.829
SUMMER: I want a drink.

26:03.829 --> 26:05.164
Come on.

26:05.164 --> 26:05.964
OK.

26:05.964 --> 26:07.099
So what do you have around here?

26:07.099 --> 26:07.900
Tequila.

26:07.900 --> 26:12.071
Do you want it just straight
or like, how do you want it?

26:12.071 --> 26:13.972
Do you want it straight
or how do you want it?

26:13.972 --> 26:15.240
Whatever you want.

26:15.240 --> 26:16.041
Whatever you're making.

26:16.041 --> 26:18.043
SUMMER: I feel like we're
flirting back and forth.

26:18.043 --> 26:19.578
I have that butterfly feeling.

26:19.578 --> 26:21.346
I like having you around.

26:21.346 --> 26:23.215
If you want to stay
longer, you can.

26:23.215 --> 26:26.885
I just feel like he's
looking at me differently.

26:26.885 --> 26:28.287
Here.

26:28.287 --> 26:29.688
What do we cheers to?

26:29.688 --> 26:30.722
All right.

26:30.722 --> 26:32.024
Come here.

26:32.024 --> 26:32.825
What?

26:32.825 --> 26:33.826
Do people even do this?

26:33.826 --> 26:34.626
I can't--

26:34.626 --> 26:38.163
Being single, drinking
double, and sleeping triple.

26:38.163 --> 26:38.964
OK.

26:45.871 --> 26:48.674
Yeah.

26:48.674 --> 26:51.743
Do you want to
go to the hot tub?

26:51.743 --> 26:53.745
No, I don't want to walk
all the way over there.

27:00.719 --> 27:01.887
What's up with that?

27:01.887 --> 27:02.688
This?

27:02.688 --> 27:05.124
I went and got the implant done.

27:05.124 --> 27:06.592
What?

27:06.592 --> 27:09.061
What are you doing?

27:09.061 --> 27:10.496
Here's our invitations.

27:10.496 --> 27:12.297
Why couldn't you hire
someone to do this?

27:12.297 --> 27:13.699
I'm doing all this on my own.

27:13.699 --> 27:15.968
So you could just [BLEEP] off
being my Maid of Honor, Nicole.

27:24.209 --> 27:29.581
SUMMER: This whole night
has led up to this one kiss

27:29.581 --> 27:32.117
and it isn't good.

27:34.753 --> 27:35.854
I feel weird.

27:35.854 --> 27:37.356
[LAUGHS]

27:37.356 --> 27:38.857
[GROWLS]

27:40.826 --> 27:43.028
There's just no chemistry.

27:43.028 --> 27:45.631
It's like I'm
kissing my brother.

27:45.631 --> 27:48.500
And I can't believe that
I don't feel anything.

27:48.500 --> 27:49.268
I'm sorry.

27:49.268 --> 27:52.704
I just feel like really weird.

27:52.704 --> 27:54.373
I need some water.

27:54.373 --> 27:55.974
Do you want a bottle of water?

27:55.974 --> 27:57.409
Yeah.

27:57.409 --> 27:58.877
You OK, though?
-Yeah.

27:58.877 --> 27:59.711
No, no, no.

27:59.711 --> 28:02.548
I'm sorry like I'm and idiot.

28:02.548 --> 28:03.682
I'm cool.

28:03.682 --> 28:04.716
Me, too.

28:04.716 --> 28:06.752
Kissing is an
instant connection

28:06.752 --> 28:07.719
that you have with someone.

28:07.719 --> 28:09.254
You can't fabricate it.

28:09.254 --> 28:12.124
So I don't understand, like,
we had such a good night.

28:12.124 --> 28:13.959
It was fun.

28:13.959 --> 28:14.760
It was flirty.

28:14.760 --> 28:16.161
It was sexy.

28:16.161 --> 28:18.764
Like, I don't know.

28:18.764 --> 28:19.565
We're good.

28:19.565 --> 28:20.432
OK.

28:20.432 --> 28:21.800
I like what we have going on.

28:21.800 --> 28:24.636
And, like, in no way, shape,
or form do I want to ruin that.

28:24.636 --> 28:26.305
So good night.

28:26.305 --> 28:27.105
Night.

28:37.082 --> 28:39.484
How does your body
feel after the workout?

28:39.484 --> 28:40.619
Oh, it feels OK.

28:40.619 --> 28:42.788
Nicole really got
on my nerves today.

28:42.788 --> 28:44.756
I'm at the point now
I'm about to tell her

28:44.756 --> 28:47.826
to [BLEEP] off from
being my Maid of Honor.

28:47.826 --> 28:48.927
Honestly.

28:48.927 --> 28:49.728
Really?

28:49.728 --> 28:50.762
That's a little much.

28:50.762 --> 28:52.231
I feel like that's
a little strong.

28:52.231 --> 28:53.031
Not a little much.

28:53.031 --> 28:54.566
Her attitude today
was a little much.

28:54.566 --> 28:55.000
Yes, it was.

28:55.000 --> 28:55.867
What are your boundaries?

28:55.867 --> 28:57.636
Like, go [BLEEP] yourself.

28:57.636 --> 29:01.340
I think Nikki was so out
of line for snapping at me.

29:01.340 --> 29:03.809
And it just bothers
me because this

29:03.809 --> 29:07.646
isn't the first time that she's
shut me down about the wedding.

29:07.646 --> 29:09.014
It's just nuts to me.

29:09.014 --> 29:12.351
Like, this is once in a
lifetime and Nicole is just

29:12.351 --> 29:14.886
really destroying it for me.

29:14.886 --> 29:15.687
Yeah.

29:24.596 --> 29:25.831
We're at the
performance center.

29:25.831 --> 29:29.568
And I've decided that I
don't need the whole locker

29:29.568 --> 29:31.937
room knowing what happened
with Fandango and I.

29:31.937 --> 29:34.206
And let's be honest, it's
a little embarrassing.

29:34.206 --> 29:36.408
So right now none
of the girls need

29:36.408 --> 29:39.645
to know any of my business.

29:39.645 --> 29:40.612
Hey, boo!

29:40.612 --> 29:41.413
Hey!

29:47.853 --> 29:49.955
What is this?

29:49.955 --> 29:51.223
It's my new arm decoration.

29:51.223 --> 29:52.224
Purple?

29:52.224 --> 29:54.226
Yeah.

29:54.226 --> 29:55.160
What do you mean?

29:55.160 --> 29:56.328
My new tattoo.

29:56.328 --> 29:57.629
You did it.

29:57.629 --> 29:59.698
Did what?

29:59.698 --> 30:01.433
Birth control implant.

30:01.433 --> 30:04.069
I am neutered for
the next three years.

30:04.069 --> 30:06.505
Mama, mama, [INAUDIBLE].

30:06.505 --> 30:07.272
No.

30:07.272 --> 30:08.073
Note yet.

30:08.073 --> 30:10.409
I'm surprised that Trin went
ahead and got the implant.

30:10.409 --> 30:12.277
Who doesn't know?

30:12.277 --> 30:13.078
Jon doesn't know?

30:13.078 --> 30:14.446
I haven't got around
to that part yet.

30:14.446 --> 30:15.247
Why?

30:15.247 --> 30:16.515
That's a big decision to make.

30:16.515 --> 30:19.217
And it's something that a
couple should make together.

30:19.217 --> 30:24.289
But, at the end of the
day, it it is her body.

30:24.289 --> 30:26.024
It looks like you're
going to touch her boobs.

30:26.024 --> 30:27.793
[KNOCKING]

30:27.793 --> 30:31.196
Hey, sunshine, come save me.

30:31.196 --> 30:34.166
Would you stop
breakdancing and come here.

30:34.166 --> 30:35.167
What up?

30:38.103 --> 30:39.137
See how she do me?
Help me.

30:39.137 --> 30:39.938
Help me, all.

30:39.938 --> 30:42.741
That's your woman.

30:42.741 --> 30:43.575
Well, let's do it, then.

30:43.575 --> 30:44.976
Oh!

30:44.976 --> 30:47.346
My butt?

30:47.346 --> 30:49.214
What's up with that?

30:49.214 --> 30:50.015
This?

30:50.015 --> 30:50.949
Oh, this old thing.

30:50.949 --> 30:52.684
I've been meaning to
tell you about this.

30:52.684 --> 30:53.485
Um.

30:57.622 --> 30:59.591
There's just this big
elephant in the room.

30:59.591 --> 31:02.728
And hopefully he's
willing to hear me out.

31:02.728 --> 31:06.198
I went and got the implant done.

31:06.198 --> 31:06.998
Really?

31:06.998 --> 31:08.100
What are you doing?

31:08.100 --> 31:08.900
Birth control.

31:12.504 --> 31:14.172
Nicole, she's my Maid of Honor.

31:14.172 --> 31:17.175
She should be supporting
me the most and she's not.

31:17.175 --> 31:22.447
So I told her to not come.

31:22.447 --> 31:23.448
What's going on?

31:23.448 --> 31:26.017
There's nothing here and
we've established that.

31:26.017 --> 31:26.818
Yeah.

31:26.818 --> 31:28.253
It's a little awkward.

31:28.253 --> 31:29.721
So I'm just a piece
of meat pretty much.

31:38.663 --> 31:40.298
Remember I told you I
was thinking about getting

31:40.298 --> 31:42.367
the birth control implant?

31:42.367 --> 31:45.637
No, I don't remember you
telling me you was going

31:45.637 --> 31:46.838
to get a birth control implant.

31:46.838 --> 31:48.907
With me missing my
pills all the time,

31:48.907 --> 31:53.412
I was very afraid that
I would pop up pregnant.

31:53.412 --> 31:58.850
To me, this is better than being
surprised with a pregnancy.

31:58.850 --> 32:00.051
We've been together this long.

32:00.051 --> 32:00.852
We ain't had no babies.

32:00.852 --> 32:02.521
We all right.

32:02.521 --> 32:04.723
It's going to happen
sooner or later.

32:04.723 --> 32:06.758
But for you to go and
do it without telling me.

32:06.758 --> 32:08.427
That [BLEEP] that shady to me.

32:08.427 --> 32:10.762
I can see if I went
and had a hysterectomy

32:10.762 --> 32:12.831
and didn't tell you about it
and now I can't have kids.

32:12.831 --> 32:13.865
I'm just saying, man.

32:13.865 --> 32:16.668
I could have been
there for that [BLEEP].

32:16.668 --> 32:20.472
NAOMI: I think Jon needs to
understand that this is my body

32:20.472 --> 32:25.076
and this is the best
option for me right now.

32:25.076 --> 32:27.813
I got the right to put
and do to it what I want.

32:27.813 --> 32:28.880
What I feel is the best for me.

32:28.880 --> 32:30.816
And I feel like this is
best for me right now.

32:30.816 --> 32:32.017
You should have hollered at me.

32:32.017 --> 32:35.554
Going to do that [BLEEP]
behind me, man, is shady.

32:45.130 --> 32:48.300
Django made this new bottle
of wine and it's amazing.

32:48.300 --> 32:49.734
You want me to pour you one?

32:49.734 --> 32:50.735
No, I'm good.

32:50.735 --> 32:52.237
Here's our invitations.

32:52.237 --> 32:53.905
-They're made out of wood.
-I know.

32:53.905 --> 32:54.940
Isn't that amazing?

32:54.940 --> 32:57.409
I thought you guys were like
against cutting down trees.

32:57.409 --> 32:58.910
Nicole have you ever
heard of recycling?

32:58.910 --> 33:01.813
So what I need you to
do is cut the yarn.

33:01.813 --> 33:03.915
Why couldn't you hire
someone to do this?

33:03.915 --> 33:05.851
Because I thought it
would be fun for sisters

33:05.851 --> 33:07.285
to get together and do this.

33:07.285 --> 33:08.487
This happens once in a lifetime.

33:08.487 --> 33:09.287
But, you know what?

33:09.287 --> 33:10.922
Yeah, and sisters don't
wrestle in the ring.

33:10.922 --> 33:11.723
OK, Nicole.

33:11.723 --> 33:13.158
You're being so rude.

33:13.158 --> 33:15.360
I came over here so you could
help me, not to have a glass

33:15.360 --> 33:16.995
and watch the [BLEEP] sunset.

33:16.995 --> 33:18.129
You're the one
that wanted to get

33:18.129 --> 33:19.097
married at the craziest time.

33:19.097 --> 33:22.501
But you're my Maid of Honor,
so you're supposed to help me.

33:22.501 --> 33:23.568
That's your job.

33:23.568 --> 33:26.137
I know, but, like, you just
don't think about at all

33:26.137 --> 33:27.639
like how my week's been.

33:27.639 --> 33:30.108
I have one second to myself and
you want me to do invitations.

33:32.644 --> 33:33.445
You know what?

33:33.445 --> 33:37.249
I am so sorry that I came
here and was an inconvenience.

33:37.249 --> 33:38.350
But I just thought--

33:38.350 --> 33:40.218
It's just been like too
much wedding stuff lately.

33:40.218 --> 33:41.019
Like, I don't even
get time to breath.

33:41.019 --> 33:42.387
What do you mean too
much wedding stuff?

33:42.387 --> 33:45.657
You're such a [BLEEP] bitch.

33:45.657 --> 33:47.125
Wow, you need to chill out.

33:47.125 --> 33:47.926
I need to chill out?

33:47.926 --> 33:49.928
You're acting crazy.

33:49.928 --> 33:52.864
No, I'll tell you
what's [BLEEP] crazy,

33:52.864 --> 33:54.366
I'm sure you'd love
that, is the fact

33:54.366 --> 33:55.834
that you won't even help me.

33:55.834 --> 33:58.103
Dude, I'm just exhausted.

33:58.103 --> 34:00.472
You're expecting a
lot from me right now.

34:00.472 --> 34:01.273
You're exhausted?

34:01.273 --> 34:02.240
I'm really [BLEEP] exhausted.

34:02.240 --> 34:03.675
But I'm doing all
this on my own.

34:03.675 --> 34:05.710
So you can just [BLEEP] off
being my Maid of Honor, Nicole.

34:10.482 --> 34:11.283
I'm a woman.

34:11.283 --> 34:14.185
I feel like I got a right
to do this to my body.

34:14.185 --> 34:15.186
Well, hell.

34:15.186 --> 34:16.353
I guess we ain't
having no babies.

34:19.391 --> 34:21.860
I'm not trying to
make you uncomfortable.

34:21.860 --> 34:23.661
You're not trying to make
me uncomfortable by jumping

34:23.661 --> 34:25.764
on my couch with me and sticking
your tongue down my throat?

34:25.764 --> 34:26.565
Oh, my gosh!

34:34.572 --> 34:38.043
So, mom, look for space 54.

34:38.043 --> 34:39.377
What kind of car
did you get us?

34:39.377 --> 34:40.844
Like some hot rod?

34:40.844 --> 34:41.913
I should have.

34:41.913 --> 34:43.514
Oh.

34:43.514 --> 34:45.283
We have so much catch up on.

34:45.283 --> 34:46.318
Oh, I know.

34:46.318 --> 34:48.286
It will be so
interesting to see what

34:48.286 --> 34:50.789
your children look like
because you're so dark

34:50.789 --> 34:51.590
and he's so light.

34:51.590 --> 34:52.389
Yeah.

34:52.389 --> 34:53.958
I'd like a boy to look like him.

34:53.958 --> 34:55.493
Be exactly like him.

34:55.493 --> 34:56.293
Aw.

34:56.293 --> 34:57.094
I can't wait.

34:57.094 --> 34:58.296
I can't wait.

34:58.296 --> 35:02.100
My kids, they need their dad
to teach them baseball and--

35:02.100 --> 35:03.101
Wrestling?

35:03.101 --> 35:03.902
Yeah.

35:03.902 --> 35:04.803
Wrestling.

35:04.803 --> 35:05.604
So cute.

35:05.604 --> 35:06.871
A little lumberjack.

35:06.871 --> 35:08.440
So everything is
good with your sister?

35:13.011 --> 35:13.812
What's up?

35:13.812 --> 35:16.815
Well, the thing is,
she's my Maid of Honor.

35:16.815 --> 35:18.650
She's supposed to
be helping me out.

35:18.650 --> 35:19.551
And she hasn't.

35:19.551 --> 35:23.355
And so I pretty much
told her to not come.

35:23.355 --> 35:26.157
And, to be honest, I don't even
feel like she wants to be here.

35:26.157 --> 35:27.525
Why do you say that?

35:27.525 --> 35:30.495
I just think that Nicole
should be putting more effort.

35:30.495 --> 35:31.296
Hello?

35:31.296 --> 35:32.397
It's my wedding time.

35:32.397 --> 35:33.498
So it's, like--

35:33.498 --> 35:34.633
It's all about you.

35:34.633 --> 35:35.433
Well, yeah.

35:35.433 --> 35:37.836
And pretty much she should
be my bitch right now.

35:37.836 --> 35:40.639
I just like as my
twin she should

35:40.639 --> 35:45.744
be supporting me the most
out of anyone and she's not.

35:45.744 --> 35:48.880
Well, it's just
very unlike her.

35:48.880 --> 35:51.449
Do you think she
doesn't even realize it

35:51.449 --> 35:53.918
but she's avoiding all this
because it's hard on her.

35:53.918 --> 35:57.489
Because in her mind
she might think this

35:57.489 --> 35:58.923
will never happen for me.

36:01.660 --> 36:05.430
I've been asking Nikki about
every opinion about my wedding

36:05.430 --> 36:09.200
and not once did I think maybe
I'm rubbing it in her face

36:09.200 --> 36:12.103
or maybe I'm not being
sensitive to her feelings

36:12.103 --> 36:14.606
about a wedding that
she may never get.

36:14.606 --> 36:16.408
I just wish she would
say something to me

36:16.408 --> 36:20.145
and just be like, I know
I haven't been there 110%,

36:20.145 --> 36:22.013
but it's because it's
really hard on me

36:22.013 --> 36:25.050
because it's something I want.

36:25.050 --> 36:26.051
[SIGH]

36:26.051 --> 36:27.052
Well, I'll talk to her.

36:37.062 --> 36:37.862
Hey, baby.

36:37.862 --> 36:39.030
Gosh, it's freezing.

36:39.030 --> 36:40.065
It's freezing, huh?

36:40.065 --> 36:42.834
Yeah, Tom said that when
they come out of the meeting,

36:42.834 --> 36:44.536
they'll figure out I
guess what's happening

36:44.536 --> 36:45.937
and they'll come up
and tell us, because I

36:45.937 --> 36:47.972
haven't heard anything at all.

36:47.972 --> 36:49.274
OK.

36:49.274 --> 36:51.976
So what happened
the other night?

36:51.976 --> 36:54.379
I feel like, I don't
know, I love what

36:54.379 --> 36:56.448
we have so much professionally.

36:56.448 --> 36:59.284
Like, you've helped me
so much in my career.

36:59.284 --> 37:00.719
I guess like
especially coming up

37:00.719 --> 37:03.488
to the main roster and
everything we've done together.

37:03.488 --> 37:05.056
So in that moment--

37:05.056 --> 37:07.092
So I'm just a piece
of meat, pretty much.

37:07.092 --> 37:07.892
No.

37:07.892 --> 37:11.896
I just feel like clearly
there's nothing here.

37:11.896 --> 37:12.897
And we've established that.

37:12.897 --> 37:13.698
Yeah.

37:13.698 --> 37:15.066
That's a little awkward.

37:15.066 --> 37:16.434
I'm not trying to
make you uncomfortable.

37:16.434 --> 37:18.236
You're not trying to make
me uncomfortable by jumping

37:18.236 --> 37:20.371
on my couch with me and sticking
your tongue down my throat?

37:20.371 --> 37:21.172
Oh, my gosh.

37:21.172 --> 37:22.807
Don't say that so loud.

37:22.807 --> 37:25.143
No one at work is supposed
to know that at all.

37:25.143 --> 37:27.746
As long as it doesn't affect
work, I'm not broken hearted.

37:27.746 --> 37:29.748
I think we both kind of
know what the situation is.

37:29.748 --> 37:30.515
Totally.

37:30.515 --> 37:33.118
I love we have and
I love our duo.

37:33.118 --> 37:35.253
If we get shipwrecked
one day on an island maybe

37:35.253 --> 37:36.888
we could try to figure
it out and make it work.

37:36.888 --> 37:39.657
But hopefully we're not
getting on any ships.

37:39.657 --> 37:41.392
Just stay away from
the Fireball shots.

37:41.392 --> 37:42.727
Oh, no more Fireball.

37:42.727 --> 37:43.528
You ready to do this?

37:43.528 --> 37:44.329
Yeah.

37:44.329 --> 37:45.163
Let's go.

37:45.163 --> 37:45.964
Let's go.

37:45.964 --> 37:47.332
Thanks for breaking my heart.

37:47.332 --> 37:48.333
I did not break your heart.

37:56.841 --> 37:57.776
Hey, babe.

37:57.776 --> 37:58.576
What's up?

38:01.546 --> 38:03.581
You been hiding
from me all day.

38:03.581 --> 38:06.217
I know you're still probably
upset from the whole birth

38:06.217 --> 38:09.087
control incident, right?

38:13.458 --> 38:16.161
I know I need this
in my arm so that we

38:16.161 --> 38:17.862
don't have kids right now.

38:17.862 --> 38:20.265
But what if I did get a
vasectomy without telling you?

38:20.265 --> 38:21.065
I'm a woman.

38:21.065 --> 38:23.701
I feel like I got the right
to do this to my body.

38:23.701 --> 38:24.502
Well, hell.

38:24.502 --> 38:26.337
I guess we ain't
having no babies.

38:36.080 --> 38:38.349
I know you're probably still
upset from the whole birth

38:38.349 --> 38:39.150
control incident.

38:41.820 --> 38:42.854
I'm a woman, babe.

38:42.854 --> 38:45.990
I feel like I got the right
to do this to my body.

38:45.990 --> 38:49.494
I know I need this so that
we don't have kids right now.

38:49.494 --> 38:50.328
I understand.

38:50.328 --> 38:51.996
You don't want kids right now.

38:51.996 --> 38:52.864
It's your body.

38:52.864 --> 38:56.034
But what if I did get a
vasectomy without telling you.

38:56.034 --> 38:57.302
I'd probably try and kill you.

38:57.302 --> 38:59.737
See?

38:59.737 --> 39:01.673
Just let me know next time.

39:01.673 --> 39:05.176
I just want to be there.

39:05.176 --> 39:07.045
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

39:07.045 --> 39:09.647
I'm sorry I did it
behind your back.

39:09.647 --> 39:13.685
I'm sorry I didn't have
that conversation with you.

39:13.685 --> 39:16.387
And I'm sorry I didn't
give you the opportunity

39:16.387 --> 39:19.791
to be there with me.

39:19.791 --> 39:23.161
This was a huge decision in
my life and in Jon's life.

39:23.161 --> 39:25.496
And I should have
talked to him about it.

39:25.496 --> 39:29.534
I'm so used to doing everything
my way and how I want it done.

39:29.534 --> 39:31.069
But me and Jon are married now.

39:31.069 --> 39:32.203
We're a team.

39:32.203 --> 39:33.605
And we have to make
decisions together.

39:37.342 --> 39:41.980
I'm still going to have babies,
just in a few more years.

39:41.980 --> 39:42.780
All right.

39:46.484 --> 39:50.054
So no more of that time of
the month and can't get none.

39:50.054 --> 39:52.056
365 you can get it now.

39:52.056 --> 39:53.258
That might have
been the best thing

39:53.258 --> 39:55.727
you did to yourself, girl?

39:55.727 --> 39:56.728
In love with me again?

39:56.728 --> 39:58.029
-I always love you.
-I love you.

39:58.029 --> 39:58.997
I love you, too.

40:03.401 --> 40:06.337
[CHEERING]

40:08.273 --> 40:09.774
RINK ANNOUNCER:
Introducing from the planet

40:09.774 --> 40:13.678
Funk-- Cameron, Naomi.

40:13.678 --> 40:17.115
The Funkadactyls!

40:17.115 --> 40:19.384
ANNOUNCER: And there is
the longest reigning Diva's

40:19.384 --> 40:22.053
champion in history-- AJ Lee.

40:22.053 --> 40:24.455
Here comes Naomi.

40:24.455 --> 40:25.890
Best athlete [INAUDIBLE].

40:25.890 --> 40:27.358
No doubt about that.

40:27.358 --> 40:29.294
I can't hear you!

40:29.294 --> 40:31.396
ANNOUNCER: Naomi
is so fun to watch.

40:31.396 --> 40:32.196
Charismatic.

40:32.196 --> 40:34.165
Look at that!

40:34.165 --> 40:35.767
This is what I'm talking about.

40:35.767 --> 40:38.636
Since day one, since I
stepped foot into the ring,

40:38.636 --> 40:44.776
my ultimate goal is to one day
be the next Diva's champion.

40:44.776 --> 40:46.678
ANNOUNCER: Naomi
having some fun.

40:46.678 --> 40:49.013
Yes, she is.

40:49.013 --> 40:51.482
AJ, I'm coming for that title.

40:51.482 --> 40:53.451
ANNOUNCER: Funk is on a roll!

40:53.451 --> 40:55.420
We love you and
good night everyone!

40:59.223 --> 41:00.224
Hey, I was looking for you.

41:00.224 --> 41:01.359
Can we have a
private conversation

41:01.359 --> 41:04.362
outside because I
don't wan to do it

41:04.362 --> 41:05.797
in front of all these people?

41:05.797 --> 41:08.132
It's true what they say
that every woman can

41:08.132 --> 41:09.567
get wrapped up in her wedding.

41:09.567 --> 41:10.835
I definitely have done that.

41:10.835 --> 41:12.603
And I realized that
I really want to make

41:12.603 --> 41:15.340
things right with Nikki.

41:15.340 --> 41:17.842
I just feel like I really need
to have a conversation with you

41:17.842 --> 41:21.346
because I'm getting married.

41:21.346 --> 41:25.183
I understand that
sometimes I might

41:25.183 --> 41:27.085
be a little crazy
because I want everything

41:27.085 --> 41:29.020
to go perfect that day.

41:29.020 --> 41:31.756
As a bride you do get
overwhelmed with everything.

41:31.756 --> 41:35.026
It is your wedding time and
I'm not a normal person where

41:35.026 --> 41:37.595
I just have all this free time
during the week and the weekend

41:37.595 --> 41:39.230
to plan all this stuff.

41:39.230 --> 41:40.932
So, like, when you
get a free moment,

41:40.932 --> 41:42.934
it is your wedding
to do invitations

41:42.934 --> 41:44.635
and I don't have
time for it, and I

41:44.635 --> 41:45.837
just don't have time for it.

41:45.837 --> 41:48.740
And I'm not trying to
be mean or be rude,

41:48.740 --> 41:52.410
but you have to think of how
busy my schedule is, too.

41:52.410 --> 41:53.544
And I realize that.

41:53.544 --> 41:54.345
I was.

41:54.345 --> 41:55.279
I talked to mom.

41:55.279 --> 41:57.181
I can only imagine
you sounded to mom.

41:57.181 --> 41:57.982
Oh, really?

41:57.982 --> 42:00.351
Mom, Nicole is
ruining my wedding.

42:00.351 --> 42:02.520
You like want me to like
sprinkle flowers everywhere

42:02.520 --> 42:03.321
you walk.

42:03.321 --> 42:04.655
That would be [BLEEP] awesome.

42:04.655 --> 42:05.656
That's what you wanted.

42:05.656 --> 42:07.325
Maybe I want to plan a wedding.

42:07.325 --> 42:09.293
Well, we could plan a
fake wedding for you.

42:09.293 --> 42:10.128
I'm just kidding.

42:10.128 --> 42:10.928
Kind of.

42:10.928 --> 42:11.796
Not really.

42:11.796 --> 42:13.631
Watching you do it
I wish it was me

42:13.631 --> 42:15.733
and I might not
ever get to do that.

42:15.733 --> 42:18.603
I am in my Brie
way apologizing.

42:18.603 --> 42:22.774
Well, in my Nikki way, fine.

42:22.774 --> 42:23.574
I forgive you.

42:23.574 --> 42:25.410
So in my Brie
way of apologizing

42:25.410 --> 42:31.682
you are accepting my
apology in your Nikki way.

42:31.682 --> 42:32.650
I'm just kidding.

42:32.650 --> 42:34.452
I was going to say, sick.

42:34.452 --> 42:37.321
Give me one of those
gross hugs you give.

42:37.321 --> 42:39.490
Why is it so weird when we hug?

42:39.490 --> 42:40.458
I don't know.

42:40.458 --> 42:41.259
I feel like perverts.

42:41.259 --> 42:42.660
Because your hands
are like molesty hands.

42:42.660 --> 42:43.461
Oh, really?

42:43.461 --> 42:44.862
They're like barely--
they're stiff.

42:44.862 --> 42:48.833
I really, really want to
just make it easier on her

42:48.833 --> 42:51.035
because having her
standing next to me

42:51.035 --> 42:52.870
while I'm marrying
the man of my dreams.

42:52.870 --> 42:55.907
Sharing that special moment.

42:55.907 --> 42:57.508
I couldn't ask for more.

42:57.508 --> 42:59.110
Imagine never
getting proposed to

42:59.110 --> 43:00.778
and having to watch
you all try on dresses.

43:00.778 --> 43:01.679
Yeah.
That does suck.

43:01.679 --> 43:04.449
Oh, my god, now you admit it.

43:04.449 --> 43:06.050
What else do you
want me to admit?

43:06.050 --> 43:07.251
That you have a [BLEEP].

43:07.251 --> 43:08.052
I do not have a penis.

43:08.052 --> 43:08.986
Yeah.
You do.

43:08.986 --> 43:09.787
No, I don't.

43:09.787 --> 43:11.889
You're my twin brother.

43:11.889 --> 43:13.424
NARRATOR: Next time,
on Total Divas.

43:13.424 --> 43:16.127
(SINGING) All you
got to do is watch me.

43:16.127 --> 43:17.295
I'm about that money.

43:17.295 --> 43:19.230
(NORMAL VOICE) I'm soon
going to be having my singles

43:19.230 --> 43:20.264
release party.

43:20.264 --> 43:21.966
I have to get some publicity.

43:21.966 --> 43:23.267
Babe, can I speak
to you for a moment?

43:23.267 --> 43:24.602
-What?
-What's with this?

43:24.602 --> 43:25.503
What do you mean,
"what's with that?"

43:25.503 --> 43:27.004
I need to chill out
because this is too much.

43:27.004 --> 43:28.973
We have an opportunity
making you guys a tag team.

43:28.973 --> 43:30.374
I don't want you to
think I'm nitpicking.

43:30.374 --> 43:31.309
I'm here trying.

43:31.309 --> 43:32.343
She just sucks.

43:32.343 --> 43:35.113
I was your only ally and now
you can go [BLEEP] yourself.

43:35.113 --> 43:37.482
Evil.
ANNOUNCER: Naomi versus Aksana.

43:37.482 --> 43:38.649
NAOMI: I hear a crack.

43:38.649 --> 43:41.886
Instantly I feel immediate pain.

43:42.305 --> 43:48.794
