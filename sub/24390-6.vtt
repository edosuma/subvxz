take on the boat.

11:48.333 --> 11:50.333
- This one's
quite well balanced.

11:50.333 --> 11:52.333

it gets a little cooler here,

11:52.333 --> 11:55.066

11:59.266 --> 12:01.200
- So now, what are
the next steps?

12:01.200 --> 12:03.600
- Typically what we do is,
we'll do a test batch.

12:03.600 --> 12:05.600
We normally have
a flat fee for that.

12:07.467 --> 12:10.133
- It's about 400 bucks.

12:10.133 --> 12:13.300
That will get you about
six 15 1/2 gallon kegs.

12:13.300 --> 12:14.734

I want to do it.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.467

something out there.

into fermentation.

- We had to leave the table.

40:21.367 --> 40:23.367
- Well, they're
talking sh-- on you.

40:25.300 --> 40:27.500
- So let's bring him out.
- Let's not.

40:27.500 --> 40:29.033
- Whitney, stop.

40:29.033 --> 40:30.233
Sit down.
- You-you brought this up--

40:30.233 --> 40:32.033
- Whitney, sit down.
Sit down.

40:32.033 --> 40:34.500
- No, no, no-no-no.
- Whitney. Whitney, come here.

40:34.500 --> 40:36.467
God damn it, Whitney.
- Austen. Austen, listen.

40:36.467 --> 40:39.500
We all have your back.

40:39.500 --> 40:42.600
- Shep, come here.
- All right.

40:42.600 --> 40:44.333
- Watch him walk
into the lion's den.

40:44.333 --> 40:46.433
- What--oh, my God.

40:49.200 --> 40:51.200
- His contention is that
you're misrepresenting--

40:51.200 --> 40:52.734
- Listen, listen.

40:52.734 --> 40:55.100
Speaking--
speaking with Chelsea today,

40:55.100 --> 40:58.000
and she kind of
recapped the conversation.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.266
She was like,
"Oh, you know, well Shep,

41:00.266 --> 41:02.533
you know, is saying that,
you know, that--"

41:02.533 --> 41:05.233
- I said that you're having a
lot of fun downtown these days.

41:05.233 --> 41:07.000
- Sure.
- And it reminds me of me.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.767
- I just thought that
it was being misrepresented.

41:08.767 --> 41:10.600
- No, no.
- And that it's like,

41:10.600 --> 41:12.233
"Oh, Austen's living my
lifestyle and hanging out..."

41:12.233 --> 41:14.467
- His contention
is that you're lying.

41:14.467 --> 41:17.266
up, Whitney.
It is not that.

41:17.266 --> 41:19.667
I just thought that
it was turning into, like,

41:19.667 --> 41:21.467
"I'm--I'm good,
and now he's bad."

41:21.467 --> 41:24.400
- No, no.
I don't think that it was--

41:24.400 --> 41:25.467
if that perceived to
be like that...

41:25.467 --> 41:27.066
- Maybe that's...

41:27.066 --> 41:28.767
- Then I--I apologize
for the miscommunication.

41:28.767 --> 41:31.367
- Okay.

41:31.367 --> 41:33.533
- Aww.
- Let's enjoy dessert.

41:33.533 --> 41:35.467
- I feel like I've been,

41:35.467 --> 41:38.133
you know, waiting
for Austen to man up

41:38.133 --> 41:40.400
and be like someone
that I could

41:40.400 --> 41:42.700
see myself with in the future.

41:42.700 --> 41:45.567
And it's just not happening.

41:45.567 --> 41:49.700
- So glad that's resolved.

41:49.700 --> 41:52.233
- Let's get the hell
out of here.

41:52.233 --> 41:54.300
- No.

41:54.300 --> 41:57.567
Stop.
- I'm sorry.

41:57.567 --> 41:59.400
- It's fine.
- Right.

42:01.266 --> 42:04.000
Okay.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.700
- On the next episode of
"Southern Charm"...

42:06.700 --> 42:08.700
Hey, Mom.

42:08.700 --> 42:10.700
- Well, I don't know,
I'm having like, cramping.

42:11.700 --> 42:13.767
- And just, like,
a lot of pressure.

42:19.133 --> 42:20.300
- You know, she was texting me,

42:20.300 --> 42:21.433
and she's like,
"Where are you?"

42:21.433 --> 42:23.066
Oh, Victoria?

42:23.066 --> 42:24.734
- And I was like,
"I'm just getting home."

42:24.734 --> 42:26.200
She's like, "All right,
I'm leaving, I'm coming over."

42:26.200 --> 42:28.734
- Uh-huh.

42:28.734 --> 42:31.433
- I definitely did not
move across the country

42:31.433 --> 42:33.600
to be with someone
that I didn't see a potential--

42:33.600 --> 42:35.300
- A future with.
- A future with.

42:35.300 --> 42:37.667
I said to him, like,
"Don't waste my time."

42:37.667 --> 42:42.333
- You know, if you have to
give an ultimatum, so be it.

42:42.333 --> 42:45.467
- I wish that
we could have just...

42:45.467 --> 42:48.200
I don't know how to
really say it but--

42:51.300 --> 42:53.734
- I'm sorry for my indecision.

42:53.734 --> 42:55.333
- I just want you.

42:55.333 --> 42:57.333
- Well, good.
- And I need you to want me.

42:57.333 --> 42:59.033
- Come here, come here,
come here.
