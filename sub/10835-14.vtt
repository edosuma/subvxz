WEBVTT

00:02.085 --> 00:04.672
Previously on 90210...
I'm pregnant.

00:04.713 --> 00:06.507
I just need some time
to think, all right?

00:06.548 --> 00:08.258
The doctor is gonna want
to know who the father is.

00:08.300 --> 00:10.260
Guess who?
Ty.

00:10.302 --> 00:11.846
Some things you say have

00:11.887 --> 00:13.054
the power to hurt people,
you know?

00:13.096 --> 00:14.306
Yeah, I think I do.

00:14.348 --> 00:15.516
So I'm gonna break up with you.

00:15.557 --> 00:17.225
You should audition, too!

00:17.267 --> 00:19.019
Nah.
Come on. Otherwise,

00:19.060 --> 00:20.729
we'll never
get to see each other.

00:20.771 --> 00:22.021
I'm really not

00:22.063 --> 00:24.149
up for the cast-and-crew dinner.

00:24.191 --> 00:25.693
The whole point of me
doing this play was

00:25.734 --> 00:27.027
so we could hang out together.
You go ahead.

00:27.068 --> 00:28.487
I changed my mind.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.656
All right. Be there in two.

00:30.698 --> 00:31.657
(horn blares, tires screech)

00:31.699 --> 00:32.658
(crashing)
Ethan?

00:32.700 --> 00:33.659
Ethan!

00:33.701 --> 00:34.785
We already go down this hallway?

00:34.827 --> 00:36.328
I think we already been down
this one.

00:36.370 --> 00:37.705
Slow down!
Slow down!

00:37.746 --> 00:39.665
Mom, I can't, okay?!
What if he's not okay?

00:39.707 --> 00:41.249
Hang on, hang on.
We are looking for Ethan Ward.

00:41.291 --> 00:42.835
He would have been admitted
about an hour ago.

00:42.877 --> 00:44.795
Annie.
Ethan, oh, my God,
you're okay!

00:44.837 --> 00:46.588
Are you okay?
You look okay.

00:46.630 --> 00:47.589
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:47.631 --> 00:49.842
I'm so, so glad.

00:49.884 --> 00:51.010
Are you in pain?

00:51.050 --> 00:52.678
Just when you squeeze
that tight.

00:52.720 --> 00:53.679
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:53.721 --> 00:54.930
You had us worried, buddy.

00:54.972 --> 00:56.515
I... yeah, I'm sorry.

00:56.557 --> 00:58.017
No, it's okay.
We're just happy
you're all right.

00:58.058 --> 00:59.184
I am.

00:59.226 --> 01:00.561
Just bruised
and shaken,

01:00.602 --> 01:03.271
but the woman in the other car,
Rhonda Kimball,

01:03.313 --> 01:05.649
I guess is her name,
she's in surgery.

01:05.691 --> 01:07.442
And if she doesn't make it...

01:07.484 --> 01:08.443
No, stop.

01:08.485 --> 01:10.571
I'm sure
she's gonna be okay, too.

01:11.822 --> 01:13.657
Do you mind if we just wait here

01:13.699 --> 01:14.783
until she's out of surgery?

01:14.825 --> 01:16.869
Yeah.
That's fine, yeah.

01:16.911 --> 01:18.037
Of course.

01:18.078 --> 01:21.081
It's gonna be okay.

01:23.250 --> 01:26.378
You have to tell Ty.
He's responsible, too, Ade.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.255
I'm just waiting
for the right moment.

01:28.296 --> 01:30.549
Yeah, well, the right moment
was about two hours ago.

01:30.591 --> 01:32.091
And two lamb
schwarmas ago.

01:32.133 --> 01:33.218
Stop eating
that crap.

01:33.260 --> 01:34.386
Hey, I'm eating for two.

01:34.428 --> 01:36.013
I'm aware of that.
Tell him.

01:42.352 --> 01:43.270
Hey, Ty.

01:43.311 --> 01:45.313
There's my leading lady.

01:45.355 --> 01:48.525
Hi. Um...

01:48.567 --> 01:50.402
do you have a sec?

01:50.444 --> 01:51.403
For my queen?

01:51.445 --> 01:52.029
Come on.

01:56.867 --> 01:58.243
So, what's going on?

01:58.285 --> 02:01.914
There's no easy way

02:01.956 --> 02:04.083
to say this.

02:04.124 --> 02:05.667
I'm pregnant.

02:08.086 --> 02:09.336
And it's your baby.

02:12.967 --> 02:14.175
What?

02:14.217 --> 02:15.677
Yeah.

02:15.719 --> 02:17.763
I thought you were,
you know, on the pill.

02:17.805 --> 02:20.557
Well, yeah, sometimes
I took those pills.

02:20.599 --> 02:21.976
Sometimes I took other pills.

02:22.017 --> 02:24.103
You'll just...

02:24.144 --> 02:25.437
get it taken care of.

02:26.688 --> 02:28.189
It's too late for that...

02:29.357 --> 02:31.110
...medically.

02:31.151 --> 02:32.152
Great.

02:34.529 --> 02:36.156
(sighs)

02:37.324 --> 02:38.617
Anyway,

02:38.659 --> 02:42.037
I thought you'd like to know.

02:44.247 --> 02:45.707
This can't be happening.

02:45.749 --> 02:47.417
I can't believe I didn't
see that stop sign.

02:47.459 --> 02:48.543
Hey, it happens.

02:48.585 --> 02:49.962
That's why they call
them "accidents."

02:50.004 --> 02:51.880
I-I wasn't paying attention,
and I was on the phone.

02:51.922 --> 02:53.298
With me.

02:53.340 --> 02:54.591
I shouldn't have called.

02:54.633 --> 02:55.801
Okay, stop it,
you two.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.302
This isn't helping anybody.

02:57.344 --> 03:00.014
I'm looking for the family
of Rhonda Kimball.

03:00.055 --> 03:01.222
COUPLE:
That's us.

03:02.724 --> 03:04.476
Your daughter has
a collapsed lung.

03:04.518 --> 03:05.727
She'll make
a full recovery.

03:05.769 --> 03:07.646
She's stabilizing now.

03:07.688 --> 03:10.398
Looks like she's
gonna be okay.

03:12.191 --> 03:13.318
You ready to head home?

03:13.360 --> 03:15.112
Uh, you guys go.
My mom's on her way,

03:15.154 --> 03:16.363
so I'll just wait
for her here.

03:16.404 --> 03:17.489
We'll wait
with you then.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.198
Actually, I wouldn't mind

03:19.240 --> 03:21.242
having a few minutes alone.

03:22.452 --> 03:25.539
I have to apologize to Rhonda.

03:25.580 --> 03:27.374
I gotta figure out
what to say.

03:27.415 --> 03:29.208
Okay. We'll see you later.

03:29.250 --> 03:32.087
Well, call me
after you talk to her, okay?
Yeah.

03:33.254 --> 03:34.506
Oh, I'm sorry.

03:34.548 --> 03:36.884
Sorry. Gentle.

03:47.769 --> 03:50.731
(door opens)

03:54.151 --> 03:56.236
Hey, uh, is he okay?

03:56.277 --> 03:57.237
Yeah.

03:57.278 --> 03:59.073
Spooked, but fine.

03:59.114 --> 04:01.408
Thank God.

04:01.449 --> 04:06.205
Guess there's, uh,
something in the air
tonight or something.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.414
What do you mean?

04:07.455 --> 04:10.291
Uh, just really
hasn't been a good night.

04:10.333 --> 04:11.585
You want to tell us

04:11.626 --> 04:12.586
what it is

04:12.627 --> 04:15.547
or should we play
charades?

04:15.589 --> 04:16.714
All right.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.050
Me and Silver broke up.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.718
What?
Why?

04:19.760 --> 04:21.053
I don't want to talk about it.

04:21.095 --> 04:22.053
Oh, honey,

04:22.096 --> 04:24.556
I'm sorry.
It's-it's cool.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.266
You know, I'm...

04:26.307 --> 04:28.936
really not into that whole
unrequited love thing.

04:28.977 --> 04:32.522
You know? So I had to get out
before one of us got hurt.

04:33.815 --> 04:35.442
Or more hurt.

04:36.610 --> 04:37.819
But, anyhow...

04:39.279 --> 04:41.406
I don't want to talk
about it, so that's it.

04:41.448 --> 04:42.741
I'm glad Ethan's okay.

04:42.783 --> 04:43.909
Yeah.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.244
And I'll see you guys tomorrow.

04:45.285 --> 04:46.745
All right, buddy.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.789
Good night.
Night.

04:48.830 --> 04:49.831
Good night.

04:54.377 --> 04:56.171
It's a proven fact
that male brains

04:56.213 --> 04:58.257
mature slower
than female brains.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.467
Trust me, Ty's, like,

05:00.508 --> 05:01.802
11 in girl years.

05:01.843 --> 05:04.846
I don't know
what I expected him to say...

05:04.888 --> 05:05.973
Ooh, are you gonna finish that?

05:06.014 --> 05:08.267
(Adrianna chuckles)

05:08.308 --> 05:10.269
Ade, you gotta tell your mom.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.437
Listen, if

05:12.479 --> 05:13.772
Perez Hilton has taught us
anything,

05:13.814 --> 05:15.107
it's that you can't hide
a baby bump forever.

05:15.149 --> 05:16.566
I'm not gonna hide it forever.

05:16.608 --> 05:18.526
Just until I figure out
what I'm gonna do.

05:18.568 --> 05:19.611
Well, maybe she could help you.

05:19.653 --> 05:20.988
My mom?

05:21.029 --> 05:22.656
Yeah, right.

05:22.697 --> 05:24.324
She could surprise you.

05:24.365 --> 05:26.910
She'll surprise me
if she doesn't kick me out.

05:26.952 --> 05:29.288
I'm practically
her personal ATM.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.580
And something tells me
I'm not gonna be

05:30.622 --> 05:32.707
booking a lot of parts
once I start to show.

05:34.835 --> 05:37.212
That's totally gonna suck.

05:37.254 --> 05:38.630
I don't know
what's gonna be worse,

05:38.672 --> 05:41.175
like, my mom finding out
or everyone at school.

05:41.216 --> 05:43.302
Oh, everyone at school.

05:43.342 --> 05:46.054
I mean, it'll be a constant
barrage of whispers and rumors,

05:46.096 --> 05:47.346
and this is not helping.
I'm sorry.

05:47.388 --> 05:48.640
No, it's true.

05:48.682 --> 05:51.977
It's... it's gonna be
totally humiliating.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.395
Like, I just, I just got
finished being rehab girl

05:54.437 --> 05:56.023
and now I have to be
pregnant girl.

05:56.064 --> 05:57.649
I'm just

05:57.691 --> 06:02.570
so sick of reading
about how screwed up I am

06:02.612 --> 06:04.531
on the bathroom walls, you know?

06:04.572 --> 06:07.326
(footsteps approaching
on stairs)

06:07.366 --> 06:08.327
WOMAN:
Adrianna?

06:08.367 --> 06:10.162
Mom, hi.

06:10.204 --> 06:12.247
I've spent all day picking up

06:12.289 --> 06:13.040
after people
at the restaurant.

06:13.081 --> 06:14.041
I hope you don't

06:14.082 --> 06:15.500
expect me
to clean up this mess.

06:15.542 --> 06:16.543
No, I'll clean it.

06:16.584 --> 06:18.586
Hello, Constance.

06:18.628 --> 06:20.172
Hi, Naomi.

06:20.214 --> 06:21.422
Don't you have a curfew?

06:21.464 --> 06:23.675
I'm staying at
the hotel, so, no.

06:23.717 --> 06:26.178
So, did you hear

06:26.220 --> 06:27.679
about the toothpaste
commercial?

06:27.721 --> 06:29.014
Yeah, I did.

06:29.056 --> 06:30.349
I didn't get it.

06:30.389 --> 06:31.350
But I got

06:31.390 --> 06:32.517
the lead at the school play.

06:32.559 --> 06:34.811
Damn.

06:34.853 --> 06:36.938
That was a national spot.

06:36.980 --> 06:40.234
Well, I-I know. I tried.

06:40.275 --> 06:41.526
Yeah.

06:41.568 --> 06:42.736
I can see all the effort.

06:42.777 --> 06:45.113
Laying around eating
mac and cheese.

06:45.155 --> 06:46.323
There's a recipe for success.

07:19.022 --> 07:20.148
Hey.

07:20.190 --> 07:21.566
Hi.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.235
Thanks for coming.

07:23.277 --> 07:27.155
I just wanted to apologize
for my reaction last night.

07:27.197 --> 07:28.782
I was in shock.

07:28.823 --> 07:30.075
And from what I remember,

07:30.117 --> 07:33.078
I didn't handle it very well.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.580
It's okay.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.457
I kind of blindsided you.

07:37.498 --> 07:39.000
No, Ade,
it's not okay.

07:39.042 --> 07:42.337
I should be more sensitive
to what you're going through

07:42.379 --> 07:43.797
and how you're feeling.

07:43.838 --> 07:45.173
How are you feeling?

07:45.215 --> 07:47.050
Emotional.

07:48.302 --> 07:49.636
Hungry all of the time.

07:49.677 --> 07:51.763
Well, look, I talked
to my parents last night.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.765
You did?

07:53.807 --> 07:56.601
Well, sure, I mean...

07:56.643 --> 07:58.812
we can't get through this
by ourselves, right?

07:58.853 --> 08:01.564
Right.

08:01.606 --> 08:03.524
What did they say?

08:03.566 --> 08:06.653
Well, they were shocked

08:06.694 --> 08:08.529
and mad,

08:08.571 --> 08:12.117
but after two very dry martinis,
they calmed down a bit

08:12.159 --> 08:14.953
and decided they'd
help us figure it out.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.496
What did your mom say?

08:16.537 --> 08:19.833
Um, pretty much the same thing.

08:19.874 --> 08:22.294
Oh.

08:22.336 --> 08:24.212
Well, my parents want to have
you guys over for dinner.

08:24.254 --> 08:25.297
Me and my mom?

08:26.173 --> 08:28.133
Yeah, I don't know

08:28.175 --> 08:30.051
if that's really a good idea.

08:30.093 --> 08:31.303
Well, they're very insistent.

08:31.345 --> 08:33.221
They want me to take
responsibility

08:33.263 --> 08:34.972
and so do I.

08:36.557 --> 08:38.018
We're in this together, Ade.

08:43.982 --> 08:45.608
All right.

08:46.985 --> 08:49.737
Now, if I order some
chili cheese fries,

08:49.779 --> 08:50.905
would you share 'em?

08:50.947 --> 08:53.200
Yeah.

08:53.241 --> 08:54.409
All right.

08:54.451 --> 08:56.077
I'm starved. (chuckles)

08:56.119 --> 08:58.497
♪ ♪

09:03.293 --> 09:04.336
You know what we got to do

09:04.378 --> 09:05.420
to get over Silver
and Adrianna, right?

09:05.462 --> 09:07.088
Yeah, I know exactly
what to do.

09:07.130 --> 09:08.840
Find a rogue scientist
who's willing to experiment

09:08.882 --> 09:10.550
with the whole eternal
sunshine thing?

09:10.591 --> 09:11.843
No.

09:11.885 --> 09:15.263
The only way to get over a girl
is to get a new girl.

09:15.305 --> 09:16.097
(laughs)

09:16.139 --> 09:18.683
Hell to the yes.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.977
Oh, man, who am I kidding?

09:21.019 --> 09:23.563
I'm never gonna get
another girl.

09:23.604 --> 09:25.940
Dude, dude, what is wrong
with you?

09:25.982 --> 09:27.608
I'm bad at the whole
dating thing, man.

09:27.650 --> 09:29.319
Nah, no, you're not.

09:29.361 --> 09:31.821
It took me 11 years
to get up the nerve

09:31.863 --> 09:32.947
to ask out Adrianna.

09:32.989 --> 09:34.533
Yeah, that is a little pathetic.

09:34.574 --> 09:35.658
You know,

09:35.700 --> 09:36.784
maybe the whole
mind-erasing thing

09:36.826 --> 09:38.619
isn't such a bad idea.

09:38.661 --> 09:41.122
Just, dude, I'm just saying,
you know?

09:41.164 --> 09:42.665
11 years?
Nice.

09:42.707 --> 09:44.292
Geez.

09:44.334 --> 09:46.794
Rhonda?

09:46.836 --> 09:48.796
Ethan Ward is here to see you.

09:48.838 --> 09:51.132
Um, hi.

09:51.174 --> 09:51.966
Hi.

09:53.134 --> 09:54.094
Look, I know this sounds weird

09:54.135 --> 09:56.054
to just come out and say it,

09:56.096 --> 09:59.349
but I'm the guy that hit you,
and I'm so sorry.

09:59.391 --> 10:01.518
And I know that
doesn't mean anything,

10:01.560 --> 10:04.312
but I just wanted to say it.

10:04.354 --> 10:05.980
We talked to the police.

10:06.022 --> 10:07.648
And we're not gonna pursue
any legal stuff,

10:07.690 --> 10:08.983
if that's why you're here.

10:09.025 --> 10:12.653
No, no, it's not,
but you could if you wanted to

10:12.695 --> 10:14.197
because it was totally my fault.

10:14.239 --> 10:16.157
I was on the phone
and I didn't see

10:16.199 --> 10:18.326
the stop sign, and...

10:18.368 --> 10:20.161
You know, the important thing
is that we're both all right.

10:20.203 --> 10:22.456
You have a punctured lung.

10:22.497 --> 10:25.500
(snickers)
Honestly, it sounds
a lot worse

10:25.542 --> 10:26.667
than it really is.

10:26.709 --> 10:28.086
I promise.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.337
Thanks.

10:29.379 --> 10:30.547
I should really be thanking you.

10:30.589 --> 10:31.672
I mean, you got me out

10:31.714 --> 10:33.007
of this killer math test
on Wednesday.

10:33.049 --> 10:34.008
Oh, yeah?

10:34.050 --> 10:35.676
What, what school do you go to?

10:36.844 --> 10:38.930
What?

10:38.972 --> 10:40.848
You're in high school, right?

10:40.890 --> 10:42.392
Yeah.

10:42.434 --> 10:44.519
I go to West Beverly.

10:46.354 --> 10:47.897
I'm in your French class.

10:47.939 --> 10:50.858
Oh, I'm...

10:50.900 --> 10:52.360
I'm really sorry.

10:52.402 --> 10:54.362
Sorry for what?

10:54.404 --> 10:56.531
Sorry for not knowing who I am?

10:56.573 --> 10:58.199
Why would you?

10:58.241 --> 10:59.534
I'm not cool.

10:59.576 --> 11:00.868
I'm not popular.

11:00.910 --> 11:02.203
You obviously
just live

11:02.245 --> 11:03.538
in your own little bubble,

11:03.580 --> 11:05.540
where people like me
don't even register.

11:05.582 --> 11:07.459
That's not true.

11:07.501 --> 11:09.127
When was the last time
you talked to somebody

11:09.169 --> 11:11.045
who wasn't running
for homecoming queen

11:11.087 --> 11:12.380
or didn't play varsity sport?

11:12.422 --> 11:14.382
We exist, Ethan.

11:14.424 --> 11:17.218
And some of us are
really interesting people.

11:17.260 --> 11:19.304
I'm not like that.

11:23.266 --> 11:24.725
I'm feeling really tired.

11:24.767 --> 11:26.269
You should probably go.

11:36.070 --> 11:37.531
Mom, Dad...

11:37.572 --> 11:39.616
this is Adrianna.
Louise Collins.

11:39.658 --> 11:41.242
It is so good to meet you.

11:41.284 --> 11:42.701
Nice to meet you,
Mrs. Collins.

11:42.743 --> 11:44.245
Please, call me Weezy.

11:44.287 --> 11:45.704
Mrs. Collins
is my mother-in-law,

11:45.746 --> 11:47.874
(half-whispers):
and between you and me,
she's a real pill.

11:47.915 --> 11:49.501
Mm, I heard that.

11:49.543 --> 11:51.252
William.
Thanks for coming by.

11:51.294 --> 11:52.546
Well, thanks
for having me.

11:52.587 --> 11:54.047
Where's
your mother, dear?

11:54.088 --> 11:56.257
Ah, she wanted to come,
but she couldn't get off work

11:56.299 --> 11:58.385
last minute.
We'll meet her
another time, I'm sure.

11:58.426 --> 11:59.718
WILLIAM:
Sit.

11:59.760 --> 12:01.638
Please.
Yes, make yourself
comfortable.

12:01.680 --> 12:04.307
We're still a few minutes
from dinner.

12:04.349 --> 12:06.725
WILLIAM:
So...

12:06.767 --> 12:08.895
(contented sigh)
what does your mother do?

12:08.936 --> 12:11.439
She's, uh...
in the restaurant business.

12:11.481 --> 12:13.441
WILLIAM:
Tough work.
Long hours.

12:13.483 --> 12:16.277
I used to bus tables
at the club in high school--

12:16.319 --> 12:17.736
hardest job I ever had.

12:17.778 --> 12:20.114
Y-Y-You were a busboy?

12:20.156 --> 12:21.740
Why is that so hard to believe?

12:21.782 --> 12:22.992
LOUISE:
Oh, because neither

12:23.034 --> 12:24.743
of us has ever seen you
pick up a damn thing

12:24.785 --> 12:26.413
in this house.

12:26.454 --> 12:28.331
(all laugh)

12:29.957 --> 12:31.418
LOUISE:
So...

12:31.459 --> 12:32.960
Shall we get down to it?

12:33.002 --> 12:34.504
Sure.

12:35.672 --> 12:37.090
How are you feeling, dear?

12:37.131 --> 12:40.759
Oh, um... I'm okay.

12:40.801 --> 12:42.596
Good, because that's
the most important thing:

12:42.637 --> 12:43.930
you have to take care
of yourself.

12:43.971 --> 12:44.931
Do you have a good doctor?

12:44.972 --> 12:46.140
ADRIANNA:
Not yet.

12:46.182 --> 12:47.808
But I went to a clinic,
and everything

12:47.850 --> 12:49.852
looks fine.
First thing, we'll have
to get you a doctor.

12:49.894 --> 12:51.312
WILLIAM:
And don't you worry.

12:51.354 --> 12:52.647
We'll take care of the cost.

12:52.689 --> 12:54.190
Oh...
Oh, don't argue

12:54.232 --> 12:56.109
with him, dear;
he's very stubborn.

12:56.150 --> 12:57.193
(Louise chuckles)

12:57.235 --> 12:59.778
LOUISE:
We want to help you,
Adrianna.

12:59.820 --> 13:02.823
You're only 16;
you shouldn't have
to deal with this alone.

13:02.865 --> 13:05.118
Dinner is ready.

13:05.159 --> 13:06.202
Oh, terrific.
Shall we?

13:06.244 --> 13:09.122
WILLIAM:
Hmm. Let's...

13:09.163 --> 13:11.332
(school bell rings)
TEACHER:
Tous ensemble, s'il vous plaît.

13:11.374 --> 13:12.667
Je vais.

13:12.709 --> 13:14.043
CLASS:
Je vais.

13:14.085 --> 13:15.086
Tu vas.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.296
CLASS:
Tu va.

13:16.337 --> 13:17.505
Il va.

13:17.547 --> 13:18.673
CLASS:
Il va.

13:18.715 --> 13:19.798
Elle va.

13:19.840 --> 13:20.799
CLASS:
Elle va.

13:20.841 --> 13:21.800
Nous allons.

13:21.842 --> 13:23.136
CLASS:
Nous allons.

13:23.177 --> 13:24.638
Vous allez.
CLASS:
Vous allez.

13:24.679 --> 13:26.139
DRAMA TEACHER:
Real insight into character

13:26.180 --> 13:27.641
isn't found onstage.

13:27.682 --> 13:29.976
It's found in rehearsal.

13:30.017 --> 13:33.772
Therefore, you will only
be allowed one absence. One.

13:35.231 --> 13:37.150
NAVID:
Oh, I'm sorry. Uh...

13:37.191 --> 13:38.735
You guys are using this room.

13:38.777 --> 13:41.112
I-I forgot.

13:42.781 --> 13:45.533
Sorry.

13:45.575 --> 13:46.534
(door closing)

13:46.576 --> 13:48.161
I'm passing out
schedules.

13:48.202 --> 13:52.540
Please commit them to your
brains and your Blackberries.

13:52.582 --> 13:55.502
Any conflicts, say them now
or forever hold your peace.

13:55.543 --> 13:57.504
So when are you
meeting my mom?

13:57.545 --> 13:59.046
In an hour.

13:59.088 --> 14:01.299
Will you call me after?

14:04.552 --> 14:05.844
(sighs)

14:05.886 --> 14:07.180
So...

14:07.221 --> 14:09.182
do you think I should
talk to her or no?

14:09.223 --> 14:12.185
Who?
Miss Casey.

14:12.226 --> 14:13.687
I-I want to ask her
what I did wrong

14:13.728 --> 14:15.480
in-in the audition,

14:15.522 --> 14:18.899
but I'm afraid that if I ask
her, she'll think that I thought

14:18.941 --> 14:22.529
that I should get the lead,
which, which I did not think,

14:22.570 --> 14:24.905
and I don't want her
to think that I thought...

14:24.947 --> 14:26.240
What do you think?

14:26.282 --> 14:27.784
I think
that you're overthinking it.

14:27.826 --> 14:28.785
Really?

14:31.287 --> 14:32.580
Should I send her balloons?

14:32.622 --> 14:33.914
Uh, Miss Casey?

14:33.956 --> 14:35.750
No, no. Rhonda.

14:35.792 --> 14:38.586
I mean, to apologize
for yesterday.

14:38.628 --> 14:40.547
Balloons?
What's wrong
with balloons?

14:40.588 --> 14:41.881
Nothing.

14:41.922 --> 14:44.091
Um, just kind of impersonal.

14:44.133 --> 14:46.093
Well, how am I supposed to
get her something personal?

14:46.135 --> 14:47.136
I don't know her.

14:54.435 --> 14:55.562
Hi, Adrianna.

14:55.603 --> 14:57.564
I'm Dr. Klein.

14:57.605 --> 14:59.065
Hi. Nice to meet you.

14:59.106 --> 15:00.400
And you must
be her mother?

15:00.441 --> 15:01.609
ADRIANNA:
Uh, no.

15:01.651 --> 15:04.320
My mom had to work,
so she couldn't make it.

15:04.362 --> 15:06.322
I'm a close friend.

15:06.364 --> 15:07.574
Gotcha.

15:07.615 --> 15:10.243
It says here, there's
a history of drug abuse.

15:10.284 --> 15:13.287
Um, yeah, but I'm clean now.

15:13.329 --> 15:15.289
Even so, I'd like her
to have an amnio.

15:15.331 --> 15:16.999
What's an amnio?

15:17.041 --> 15:18.167
Under local anesthesia,

15:18.209 --> 15:19.753
we run a thin needle
into the amniotic sac

15:19.794 --> 15:21.003
and extract a little fluid.

15:21.045 --> 15:22.505
And from that fluid,
we can test the fetus

15:22.547 --> 15:23.757
for abnormalities.

15:23.798 --> 15:25.341
Normally we don't do it
for a girl your age,

15:25.383 --> 15:26.760
but...
With your history,

15:26.801 --> 15:28.094
I really think
it's a good idea.

15:28.135 --> 15:29.679
I mean, God forbid

15:29.721 --> 15:30.805
anything's wrong, we'll know.

15:30.847 --> 15:32.640
Okay.

15:32.682 --> 15:35.393
Great.
First things first.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.604
You need an ultrasound.

15:37.645 --> 15:39.522
Lift up your shirt.

15:43.651 --> 15:45.194
(laughs)

15:45.236 --> 15:46.195
(both laughing)

15:46.237 --> 15:47.655
Huh.

15:47.697 --> 15:49.532
(gurgling)
Okay, Adrianna,

15:49.574 --> 15:50.700
there's your baby.

15:50.742 --> 15:52.619
Those are the legs...

15:52.660 --> 15:56.706
and the arms.

15:56.748 --> 15:58.124
That's the nose...

15:58.165 --> 15:59.542
and an ear.

16:02.879 --> 16:05.632
It just... it just...
didn't seem real before.

16:05.673 --> 16:07.508
I know.

16:09.093 --> 16:10.970
I know.
(laughs)

16:11.011 --> 16:12.305
(chuckles)

16:12.346 --> 16:14.098
Oh...

16:24.818 --> 16:26.653
ADRIANNA:
Thanks for all your help, Ty.
My pleasure.

16:26.694 --> 16:28.905
Thanks again
for all the maternity clothes

16:28.947 --> 16:30.072
You're welcome, honey.

16:30.114 --> 16:31.908
Before you go, I wanted
to give you this.

16:31.950 --> 16:33.242
"Peaceful Vista"?

16:33.284 --> 16:34.494
It's in New Mexico.

16:34.535 --> 16:35.995
Once you to start to show,
you can go there,

16:36.036 --> 16:38.372
and stay until you
deliver the baby.

16:38.414 --> 16:40.040
It's supposed to be gorgeous.

16:40.082 --> 16:41.375
A friend of a friend's went,

16:41.417 --> 16:42.877
and she said it was
like a spa vacation.

16:42.919 --> 16:44.044
It looks beautiful.

16:44.086 --> 16:45.505
Oh, and this is for
your mother, dear.

16:45.546 --> 16:46.798
It's a legal contract

16:46.840 --> 16:48.549
just laying out the terms
of our financial commitment.

16:48.591 --> 16:50.551
It says we'll pay for your stay,

16:50.593 --> 16:52.345
and after, we'll arrange
for the adoption of the child.

16:52.386 --> 16:54.388
The adoption?

16:54.430 --> 16:56.808
Well, there are a lot
of deserving people
who can't have kids,

16:56.850 --> 16:58.977
and what other choice
is there?

16:59.018 --> 17:01.061
I guess I hadn't really thought
about it.

17:01.103 --> 17:03.272
Well, I guess
it's time to start.

17:03.314 --> 17:05.023
Have your mother
look it over.

17:05.065 --> 17:07.527
And if the terms look agreeable,
which I'm sure they will,

17:07.568 --> 17:09.278
then that will be that. Okay?

17:09.319 --> 17:11.196
(laughs)
Okay.

17:13.449 --> 17:15.535
(sighs)

17:15.576 --> 17:17.494
(knocking "Shave and a Haircut")

17:18.746 --> 17:20.790
What are you doing here?

17:20.832 --> 17:23.459
Well, last time I was here,
you were watching TV,

17:23.501 --> 17:26.212
but there was nothing on, so...

17:26.252 --> 17:28.464
I'm loaning you my DVD player.

17:28.506 --> 17:30.466
But then I ran
into a problem

17:30.508 --> 17:31.843
when I was trying
to pick out movies

17:31.885 --> 17:34.053
because I didn't know
if you would like

17:34.094 --> 17:37.682
action-adventure
or... comedy,

17:37.724 --> 17:41.477
or romance, or horror...
or, uh, romantic horror,

17:41.519 --> 17:43.855
which isn't a popular genre,
but apparently,

17:43.897 --> 17:45.773
it does exist,
and apparently,

17:45.815 --> 17:47.233
the Swedes have mastered it.

17:47.274 --> 17:49.235
(chuckles)
And oh, I wanted
to get you snacks,

17:49.276 --> 17:50.528
because movies
without snacks suck,

17:50.570 --> 17:53.406
but I didn't know
if you like sweet or salty,

17:53.447 --> 17:57.660
so I got you pretzels
and... chocolate.

17:57.702 --> 18:00.246
I also got chocolate-
covered pretzels

18:00.287 --> 18:02.331
in case you like sweet
and salty together.

18:02.373 --> 18:03.249
Ethan...

18:04.291 --> 18:06.126
What is this about?

18:07.587 --> 18:10.882
I'm... I'm just trying
to get to know you.

18:12.926 --> 18:15.845
So, what's it going to be?

18:15.887 --> 18:18.264
Uh, Mission Impossible

18:18.305 --> 18:20.016
or The Wedding Planner?

18:20.058 --> 18:21.768
Uh, The Wedding Planner.

18:21.809 --> 18:24.437
And maybe some
chocolate-covered pretzels.

18:24.478 --> 18:25.438
All right.

18:25.479 --> 18:26.689
Want to stay and watch?

18:29.316 --> 18:31.444
Oh, you have
somewhere to be.

18:31.485 --> 18:32.779
Just play rehearsal.

18:32.820 --> 18:34.447
But we're... we're allowed
to blow one off,

18:34.488 --> 18:36.240
so yes, I'll stay.

18:36.282 --> 18:38.367
As long as you're okay
with the occasional

18:38.409 --> 18:40.703
"this-is-such-a-lame-
chick-flick" commentary.

18:40.745 --> 18:41.955
(laughs)

18:41.996 --> 18:43.581
Yeah.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.374
♪ Let me get
right to the point ♪

18:45.416 --> 18:48.628
♪ Girl, you're a dime piece,
you're so on point... ♪

18:48.669 --> 18:51.756
"When you meet a girl, you need
to passively insult her,

18:51.798 --> 18:54.801
"thus actively demonstrating
your disinterest,

18:54.842 --> 18:56.636
"which has the effect
of elevating

18:56.677 --> 18:58.387
said girl's interest in you."

18:58.429 --> 19:00.431
Are you kidding
me with this?

19:00.473 --> 19:02.600
That book worked
for my cousin, Avi.
He's swimming in chicks.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.060
And he is funky-looking.

19:04.102 --> 19:05.812
Uh, all right.

19:05.853 --> 19:08.648
Mm, I'm gonna give it a try.

19:08.689 --> 19:10.399
Do your thing, bro.

19:10.441 --> 19:11.943
Do my thing, bro.

19:11.985 --> 19:13.569
Hey, what's up?

19:13.611 --> 19:15.071
Not much.
You know,

19:15.113 --> 19:16.405
you'd be really
beautiful

19:16.447 --> 19:19.325
if you didn't have
that bad hairdo.

19:21.452 --> 19:22.996
Get lost, creep!

19:23.037 --> 19:25.247
Amazing.

19:25.289 --> 19:26.248
Amazing.

19:26.290 --> 19:27.667
I wish I had it on video,

19:27.708 --> 19:29.335
so I could put it on YouTube.
(Christina laughs)

19:29.376 --> 19:30.503
Shut up.
(laughs)

19:30.544 --> 19:31.629
What was that all about?

19:31.671 --> 19:34.132
Um, well, Navid has a book.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.009
Dude, don't sell me out.

19:36.050 --> 19:37.593
The Credo?
You do not read

19:37.635 --> 19:39.095
this disgusting,
insulting book.

19:39.137 --> 19:40.346
No.
Navid,

19:40.387 --> 19:41.514
have you met Christina?

19:41.555 --> 19:42.849
No.

19:42.890 --> 19:44.350
Hi.
Hi.

19:44.391 --> 19:45.810
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

19:45.852 --> 19:49.188
So you're trying
to meet a girl?

19:49.229 --> 19:52.358
Well, if you want to meet
a girl, don't trust that.

19:52.399 --> 19:54.068
You know, you should
trust someone

19:54.110 --> 19:55.653
who kind of knows
how a girl thinks.

19:57.905 --> 19:59.615
Me.

19:59.657 --> 20:01.534
Oh, you two are really clueless.

20:01.575 --> 20:03.786
You need to come to
my friend's party.
Hot band,

20:03.828 --> 20:05.245
hot girls--
I'll hook you up.

20:05.287 --> 20:06.706
No, mm-hmm.
Hold on. Wait a minute.

20:06.747 --> 20:07.874
No, just him.

20:07.915 --> 20:09.291
I don't need your
help with no ladies.

20:09.333 --> 20:10.626
'Cause believe me,

20:10.668 --> 20:14.213
if Dixon wants a girl,
Dixon gets a girl.

20:14.254 --> 20:17.633
And not if "Dixon" talks
in the third person like a tool.

20:17.675 --> 20:18.551
Yeah, right.

20:18.592 --> 20:20.302
(laughs)
Touché.

20:20.344 --> 20:21.554
Fair enough.

20:22.680 --> 20:24.223
Hot stone massages.

20:24.264 --> 20:26.059
They have hot stone massages.

20:26.100 --> 20:28.686
Have you looked
at this?
No, not yet.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.730
Ooh, they have, like, a ski
resort, like, half-hour away.

20:30.771 --> 20:32.857
I don't think you'd be doing
a lot of skiing

20:32.899 --> 20:34.233
during your third trimester.

20:34.274 --> 20:35.735
You might be right,

20:35.776 --> 20:38.738
but I'll be doing a lot
of seaweed mud masks, though.

20:38.779 --> 20:41.699
Sure, you just have to "sign
away all rights to said issue."

20:41.741 --> 20:43.659
There are a lot of deserving
people who can't have kids.

20:43.701 --> 20:44.660
Yeah, I know.

20:44.702 --> 20:45.912
I saw Juno, too.

20:45.953 --> 20:47.997
Look, this has a
nondisclosure agreement

20:48.039 --> 20:49.999
that says you can't talk about
the fact that Ty's the father.

20:50.041 --> 20:52.210
I guess that's okay.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.670
It also says
that you can't talk

20:54.712 --> 20:57.256
about the "events and
circumstances leading up to

20:57.297 --> 20:59.717
and including the pregnancy
and birth of said issue."

20:59.759 --> 21:01.635
Ever. Basically, what
we're doing right now--

21:01.677 --> 21:03.429
totally illegal.

21:03.470 --> 21:06.557
I'm sure that's just overzealous
lawyer talk or something.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.226
I don't know, Ade.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.394
This thing reads like
a friggin' gag order.

21:10.436 --> 21:12.772
I mean, it has serious damages
if you don't comply.

21:12.813 --> 21:13.856
What is your problem?!

21:13.898 --> 21:15.149
Okay, this is
a plan, finally.

21:15.191 --> 21:17.735
Why do you have
to be so negative?

21:17.777 --> 21:20.113
I'm not being negative.
I don't want you to be
taken advantage of.

21:20.154 --> 21:22.281
Yeah, well, the Collinses
aren't like that.

21:22.322 --> 21:23.657
(cell phone thuds on table)
Ugh!

21:23.699 --> 21:25.034
What are you doing?

21:25.076 --> 21:26.119
I'm gonna clear things up.

21:30.915 --> 21:34.961
Hey, Ty, it's Ade calling.

21:35.002 --> 21:37.421
You're probably
in a fierce game

21:37.463 --> 21:39.465
of Dragon Fury right now.

21:39.506 --> 21:41.801
But if you could tear yourself
away for just a minute,

21:41.842 --> 21:43.761
that would be great.

21:43.803 --> 21:45.387
Uh, there's just some things
in the contract

21:45.429 --> 21:47.431
that I find a little weird.

21:47.473 --> 21:48.933
Um, it's not a big deal.

21:48.975 --> 21:52.645
I just want to clarify them,
so, um, give me a call.

21:52.686 --> 21:53.729
And yeah.

21:53.771 --> 21:55.815
Oh, say hi to your
parents for me.

21:55.856 --> 21:57.399
Okay, bye.

21:57.441 --> 21:59.401
Happy?

22:05.324 --> 22:06.742
Don't-don't push
yourself, okay?

22:06.784 --> 22:07.994
Who are you, Usain Bolt?

22:08.035 --> 22:09.328
You just had surgery.

22:09.369 --> 22:10.913
I got to pass
the old guy.

22:10.955 --> 22:12.957
Ah, the competitor kicks in.
Okay.

22:12.999 --> 22:14.959
No, his gown keeps opening

22:15.001 --> 22:16.543
and I'm sick of seeing his ass.

22:16.585 --> 22:18.087
Oh, all right.
Yeah, no, you're right.

22:18.129 --> 22:19.880
All right, let's pass
him on the outside,

22:19.922 --> 22:21.507
and pretend it's like
the last minutes

22:21.548 --> 22:23.592
of the game, okay?
I should tell you

22:23.634 --> 22:25.678
that sports talk is
pretty much lost on me.

22:25.719 --> 22:26.971
I've never been to a game

22:27.013 --> 22:28.181
or a match

22:28.222 --> 22:29.640
or anything sports-related.

22:29.682 --> 22:32.476
So, uh, maybe I'm
not the only one

22:32.518 --> 22:33.853
living in
a bubble then?

22:33.894 --> 22:35.855
You're right,
but no more.

22:35.896 --> 22:37.523
What, all sports
all the time?

22:37.564 --> 22:38.858
All new experiences
all the time.

22:38.899 --> 22:40.358
You know how they say
your life

22:40.400 --> 22:42.444
flashes before your eyes
in an accident?

22:42.486 --> 22:44.030
Well, mine did, and all I saw

22:44.071 --> 22:46.157
was a bunch
of jazz band rehearsals.

22:46.199 --> 22:48.784
Yeah, all I saw was one long
SportsCenter reel.

22:48.826 --> 22:51.329
There's so much more out there.

22:51.369 --> 22:52.538
There's things
I haven't tried,

22:52.579 --> 22:53.789
things I haven't even

22:53.831 --> 22:55.415
thought about trying.

22:55.457 --> 22:57.335
Yeah, I always wanted to
learn to play the guitar.

22:57.375 --> 22:58.627
Then you should.

22:58.669 --> 23:00.254
And go skydiving?
Let's sign up.

23:00.296 --> 23:01.547
I've always wanted
to go camping.

23:01.588 --> 23:02.589
Oh, that's easy enough.

23:02.631 --> 23:04.175
I know, I just...

23:04.217 --> 23:06.468
I always assumed
there'd be time, you know?

23:06.510 --> 23:08.554
But I'm not going to live
like that anymore.

23:08.595 --> 23:10.806
I'm going to live like
there's no time

23:10.848 --> 23:12.766
and that every day
could be my last.

23:12.808 --> 23:14.894
Carpe diem.
Exactly.

23:17.730 --> 23:20.024
Miss Casey. Hi.
I just wanted to say

23:20.066 --> 23:21.817
that I'm sorry that Ethan

23:21.859 --> 23:23.027
wasn't at rehearsal today.

23:23.069 --> 23:25.154
He must have lost
track of time.

23:25.196 --> 23:26.239
Oh, it's fine.

23:26.280 --> 23:27.240
Everyone can miss one.

23:29.449 --> 23:30.659
Is that all?

23:30.701 --> 23:31.827
Yeah.

23:31.869 --> 23:33.746
No, no, um...

23:33.787 --> 23:34.914
It's not

23:34.955 --> 23:37.333
that I expected to get
the lead in the play,

23:37.375 --> 23:38.834
because I absolutely

23:38.876 --> 23:40.418
did not,

23:40.460 --> 23:43.172
but I love acting,
and I really want to get better

23:43.214 --> 23:45.007
because this is really

23:45.049 --> 23:46.550
what I've always wanted to do.

23:46.592 --> 23:48.552
Well, your passion

23:48.594 --> 23:50.470
will certainly work
in your favor,

23:50.512 --> 23:52.848
and an acting class

23:52.890 --> 23:53.933
will help as well.

23:53.974 --> 23:55.017
You have talent, Annie.

23:55.059 --> 23:56.685
It's just that
acting is craft.

23:56.727 --> 23:58.062
You know,
just like anything else,

23:58.104 --> 23:59.437
like blacksmithing.

23:59.479 --> 24:01.023
You know,
you're not born

24:01.065 --> 24:03.150
knowing how to be
a blacksmith, right?

24:03.192 --> 24:05.278
You have to study,
learn your craft.

24:05.319 --> 24:07.780
I'll make you a list of some
good acting classes, okay?

24:07.821 --> 24:09.489
Have a good night.

24:25.172 --> 24:27.133
Thank you.

24:27.174 --> 24:28.968
Weezy, hi.

24:29.009 --> 24:30.886
Adrianna, hello.

24:30.928 --> 24:31.971
What are you...

24:32.012 --> 24:33.055
doing here?

24:33.097 --> 24:34.556
Well, Ty said you called
with some concerns.

24:34.598 --> 24:36.434
So I thought it was time
I sit down with your mother.

24:36.474 --> 24:38.685
I was going to leave her
a note with my number,

24:38.727 --> 24:40.813
but I saw her car, and I
thought perhaps she was home.

24:40.854 --> 24:43.316
Oh, you know, it's just...
it's not really
a great time right now.

24:47.694 --> 24:50.239
You must be Constance.

24:57.371 --> 25:00.166
Sorry to just drop in on you
out of the blue,

25:00.207 --> 25:02.542
but I thought we should talk
about the situation

25:02.584 --> 25:04.044
the kids are in.

25:04.086 --> 25:06.504
Especially since it is rather
pressing, don't you agree?

25:06.546 --> 25:08.424
Certainly seems
that way.

25:10.592 --> 25:12.510
It is... it is pressing.

25:12.552 --> 25:13.679
Um...

25:13.720 --> 25:15.681
because, uh... well...

25:15.722 --> 25:16.765
um...

25:18.351 --> 25:19.352
because the baby

25:19.393 --> 25:21.854
is due in five months.

25:21.895 --> 25:24.231
Naturally, I was
a little surprised

25:24.273 --> 25:28.361
when Adrianna said
she had some concerns
about the contract.

25:28.402 --> 25:31.280
Remind me about your
specific concerns.

25:31.322 --> 25:34.574
Um, well, the Collinses
have been so nice.

25:34.616 --> 25:37.535
They've offered to pay
for the entire stay
at Peaceful Vista.

25:37.577 --> 25:39.246
And the place
looks great.

25:39.288 --> 25:40.373
And from
what I hear,

25:40.414 --> 25:41.748
New Mexico...

25:41.790 --> 25:42.958
seems nice.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.210
It's just

25:44.251 --> 25:47.545
not being able to talk
about what happened,

25:47.587 --> 25:49.048
that part
of the contract

25:49.089 --> 25:50.590
seems kind of severe.

25:50.632 --> 25:53.886
Adrianna, you and Ty have your
whole lives in front of you.

25:53.927 --> 25:55.762
This is not something
we want to follow you around.

25:55.804 --> 25:57.223
I mean,

25:57.264 --> 25:59.975
do you really want everyone
to know what you've done?

26:00.017 --> 26:00.976
Well, no.

26:01.018 --> 26:01.977
But I'm not

26:02.019 --> 26:03.896
exactly sure what "done"

26:03.937 --> 26:05.064
is going to be yet.

26:05.105 --> 26:06.482
I mean,

26:06.524 --> 26:08.942
I'll probably give it up
for adoption.

26:08.984 --> 26:10.610
Probably?

26:12.363 --> 26:13.447
You're a 16-year-old girl.

26:13.489 --> 26:14.572
What other choice
is there?

26:14.614 --> 26:15.782
Let's look
at the facts.

26:15.824 --> 26:17.243
You had a drug problem.

26:17.284 --> 26:18.744
You got yourself pregnant.

26:18.785 --> 26:20.454
Then you put us all
into a position

26:20.496 --> 26:22.248
where it was too late
to terminate.

26:22.289 --> 26:23.916
Do you really think
you're responsible enough

26:23.957 --> 26:26.252
to be a mother?
That's not fair.

26:26.293 --> 26:27.585
Yes,

26:27.627 --> 26:29.463
I did those things,

26:29.505 --> 26:31.924
but that's because I was using,

26:31.965 --> 26:33.551
not because
of who I am.

26:33.591 --> 26:34.968
I'm actually really responsible.

26:35.010 --> 26:36.303
Adrianna, stop talking.

26:39.848 --> 26:44.644
My daughter is someone who has
been bringing home a paycheck

26:44.686 --> 26:46.272
since she was
five years old.

26:46.313 --> 26:48.482
Someone who didn't know
how to ride a bicycle,

26:48.524 --> 26:51.485
but when the role demanded
that she ride one,

26:51.527 --> 26:52.819
she learned in an hour.

26:52.861 --> 26:54.780
And yes, she had
a drug problem,

26:54.821 --> 26:57.116
but she also kicked
that drug problem,

26:57.157 --> 26:59.076
and cleaned
herself up,

26:59.118 --> 27:01.245
and stayed in school
and got the lead in the play.

27:01.287 --> 27:02.204
So let's just be clear.

27:03.663 --> 27:06.083
She is very responsible.

27:06.125 --> 27:08.294
And listen to me:

27:08.335 --> 27:09.962
this is not your choice.

27:10.003 --> 27:11.422
It's hers.

27:11.464 --> 27:14.133
Please, spare me
the supportive mother act.

27:14.174 --> 27:16.469
You didn't even know she was
pregnant five minutes ago.

27:16.510 --> 27:18.262
Adrianna, sweetheart,
don't be foolish.

27:18.304 --> 27:19.637
Don't you want
your child

27:19.679 --> 27:22.057
to have a better life
than you have?

27:22.099 --> 27:23.058
That's it.

We're done.
