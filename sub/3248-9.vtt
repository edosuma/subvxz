00:00.360 --> 00:05.496
The Library! So big it doesn't
need a name. Someone's got in.
Someone's in my library.

00:05.580 --> 00:07.304
4,022 saved.

00:07.339 --> 00:09.900
No survivors. Others are coming.

00:09.935 --> 00:11.340
What...others?

00:16.940 --> 00:21.379
Professor River Song, archaeologist.
You've seen me before, then?

00:21.414 --> 00:25.860
The real world is a lie,
and your nightmares are real.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.944
What's CAL?! The Library is real.

00:28.979 --> 00:33.540
There are people trapped in there,
people who need to be saved.

00:33.575 --> 00:35.705
There's a neural relay
in the communicator.

00:35.740 --> 00:40.699
Sometimes it can hold an impression
of a living consciousness for
a short time after death.

00:40.734 --> 00:43.459
The shadows are moving again.
Only you can save them.

00:43.494 --> 00:46.539
The piranhas of the air,
the Vashta Nerada.

00:49.340 --> 00:51.559
Donna Noble has been saved.

00:51.594 --> 00:53.744
Donna Noble has been saved.

00:53.779 --> 00:56.385
Donna Noble has left the Library.

00:56.420 --> 00:59.999
Donna Noble has been saved.
Hey! Who turned out the lights?

01:00.034 --> 01:03.506
Donna Noble has left the Library.
Donna Noble has been saved.

01:03.541 --> 01:06.979
Hey! Who turned out the lights?
Donna Noble has left the Library.

01:07.014 --> 01:09.099
Donna Noble has been saved.

Hey! Who turned out the lights?

01:54.300 --> 01:57.304
This way, quickly, move!

01:57.339 --> 01:59.825
Hey! Who turned out the lights?

01:59.860 --> 02:03.340
Dad, the Library,
it's on television now.

02:03.659 --> 02:04.985
How many times, darling?

02:05.020 --> 02:07.740
The Library is just
your imagination.

02:39.620 --> 02:41.260
Donna?

02:53.620 --> 02:55.660
Hello, Donna.

02:55.695 --> 02:57.897
Who are you?

02:57.932 --> 03:00.065
I'm Dr Moon.

03:00.100 --> 03:03.739
I've been treating you since
you came here two years ago.

03:03.774 --> 03:07.900
Oh, God, Dr Moon, I'm so sorry!

03:07.935 --> 03:09.784
What's wrong with me?

03:09.819 --> 03:11.344
I didn't know you for a moment.

03:11.379 --> 03:15.625
And then you remembered.
Shall we go for a walk?

03:15.660 --> 03:21.099
No more dreams, then? The Doctor
and the blue box, time and space.

03:22.939 --> 03:25.265
How did we get here?

03:25.300 --> 03:28.660
We came down the stairs,
out the front door.

03:28.695 --> 03:31.940
We passed Mrs Ali on the way out.

03:31.975 --> 03:34.700
Yeah. Yeah, we did.

03:35.940 --> 03:38.380
I forgot that.
And then you remembered.

03:40.819 --> 03:43.585
Shall we go down to the river?

03:43.620 --> 03:47.699
You said "river" and suddenly
we're feeding ducks.

03:47.734 --> 03:49.060
Dr Moon!

03:50.099 --> 03:51.140
Morning.

03:51.819 --> 03:54.139
Donna Noble, Lee McAvoy.

03:55.300 --> 03:56.584
Hello, Lee.

03:56.619 --> 03:59.625
Hello, D-D... D...

03:59.660 --> 04:03.820
Ooh, you've got bit of a stammer
there... Bless!

04:03.855 --> 04:05.305
D... D...

04:05.340 --> 04:08.379
Oh, skip to a vowel, they're easy!

04:08.414 --> 04:11.384
How did we leave it, him and me?

04:11.419 --> 04:15.420
I got the impression he was
inviting you fishing tomorrow.

04:18.459 --> 04:20.540
So...

04:20.575 --> 04:22.620
Fishing!

04:26.379 --> 04:27.945
D... D...

04:27.980 --> 04:31.140
Gorgeous and can't speak a word.

04:32.700 --> 04:34.380
What am I going to do with you?

04:35.219 --> 04:39.020
Welcome home, M-Mrs McAvoy.

04:42.940 --> 04:45.980
Stop it!
Stop it now, we've got a visitor.

04:46.015 --> 04:48.985
You've done so much
in seven years, Donna.

04:49.020 --> 04:54.860
Sometimes it feels more like 70.
Mind you, sometimes it
feels like no time at all.

04:58.220 --> 05:01.780
is to see you fully integrated?

05:04.100 --> 05:09.900
No, the signal's definitely coming
from the moon. I'm blocking it,
but it's trying to break through.

05:09.935 --> 05:11.665
Donna!

05:11.700 --> 05:15.460
Oops, sorry.
Mrs Angelo's rhubarb surprise.

05:15.495 --> 05:16.780
Will I never learn?

05:18.380 --> 05:20.504
The Doctor!

05:20.539 --> 05:22.625
I saw the Doctor!

05:22.660 --> 05:26.660
Yes, you did, Donna,
and then...you forgot.

05:28.339 --> 05:30.944
Dr Moon! Oh, hello!

05:30.979 --> 05:33.099
Shall I make you a cup of tea?

05:52.219 --> 05:54.145
OK, we've got a clear spot.
In, in, in!

05:54.180 --> 05:57.100
Right in the centre, in the
middle of the light, quickly!

05:57.135 --> 05:59.940
Don't let your shadows cross.
Doctor...

05:59.975 --> 06:01.424
I'm doing it.

06:01.459 --> 06:06.100
There's no lights here.
Sunset's coming, we can't stay long.

06:07.859 --> 06:12.499
Have you found a live one?
Maybe, it's getting harder to tell.
What's wrong with you?

06:12.534 --> 06:15.539
We're going to need a chicken leg.
Who's got a chicken leg?

06:15.574 --> 06:17.500
Thanks, Dave.

06:22.020 --> 06:25.064
OK... OK, we've got a hot one.
Watch your feet.

06:25.099 --> 06:30.019
They won't attack until there's
enough of them, but they've got
our scent now, they're coming.

06:31.620 --> 06:33.344
Who is he?

06:33.379 --> 06:38.579
You haven't even told us.
You just expect us to trust him.

06:38.614 --> 06:40.025
And who is the Doctor?

06:40.060 --> 06:43.660
The only story you'll ever tell -
if you survive him.

06:45.339 --> 06:48.540
You say he's your friend, but he
doesn't even know who you are.

06:48.575 --> 06:50.585
Listen, all you need to know
is this...

06:50.620 --> 06:53.059
I'd trust that man to the end
of the universe,

06:53.094 --> 06:54.419
and actually we've been.

06:58.579 --> 07:00.540
He doesn't act like he trusts you.

07:00.575 --> 07:02.540
Yeah, there's a tiny problem.

07:02.575 --> 07:04.819
He hasn't met me yet.

07:09.060 --> 07:13.980
What's wrong with it?
There's a signal coming from
somewhere, interfering with it.

07:14.015 --> 07:16.780
Use the red settings.
It doesn't have a red setting.

07:16.815 --> 07:19.740
Well, use the dampers.
It doesn't have dampers.

07:19.775 --> 07:21.060
It will do one day.

07:24.819 --> 07:28.259
So some time in the future, I just
give you my screwdriver. Yeah.

07:28.294 --> 07:31.700
And why would I do that? I didn't
pluck it from your cold dead hands,

07:31.735 --> 07:34.579
if that's what you're worried about.
I know that because...?

07:34.614 --> 07:36.344
Listen to me.

07:36.379 --> 07:39.545
You've lost your friend,
you're angry, I understand.

07:39.580 --> 07:42.959
But you need to be less emotional,
Doctor. I'm not emotional.

07:42.994 --> 07:46.339
There are five people in this
room still alive, focus on that.

07:46.374 --> 07:49.579
Dear God, you're hard work young.
Young? Who are you?!

07:49.614 --> 07:52.064
Oh, for heaven's sake!
Look at the pair of you!

07:52.099 --> 07:56.860
We're all going to die right here,
and you're just squabbling
like an old married couple.

07:59.779 --> 08:01.060
Doctor...

08:02.739 --> 08:06.984
..one day I'm going to be someone
that you trust completely,

08:07.019 --> 08:11.580
but I can't wait for you to find that
out. So I'm going to prove it to you.

08:11.615 --> 08:13.740
And I'm sorry.

08:16.659 --> 08:19.340
I'm really very sorry.

08:31.459 --> 08:32.539
Are we good?

08:34.578 --> 08:37.619
Doctor...are we good?

08:40.019 --> 08:41.020
Yeah...

08:42.139 --> 08:43.140
Yeah, we're good.

08:47.140 --> 08:48.659
Good.

08:56.460 --> 08:58.984
Know what's interesting
about my screwdriver?

08:59.019 --> 09:01.620
Very hard to interfere with,
nothing's strong enough...

09:01.655 --> 09:03.944
Well, some hairdryers,
but I'm working on that.

09:03.979 --> 09:09.700
So there is a very strong signal
coming from somewhere, and it wasn't
there before, so what's changed?

09:09.735 --> 09:11.384
Come on! What's new?

09:11.419 --> 09:13.939
What's different? I dunno, nothing.

09:14.540 --> 09:18.820
It's getting dark. It's a
screwdriver, it works in the dark.

09:23.019 --> 09:28.900
Tell me about the moon.
What's there? It's not real, it was
built as part of the Library.

09:28.935 --> 09:31.945
It's just a doctor moon. What's
a doctor moon? A virus checker.

09:31.980 --> 09:35.580
It supports and maintains the main
computer at the core of the planet.

09:35.615 --> 09:39.425
Well, it's still active,
it's signalling, look.

09:39.460 --> 09:43.219
Someone somewhere in this Library
is alive and communicating with the

09:43.254 --> 09:46.737
moon, or possibly alive
and drying their hair.

09:46.772 --> 09:50.185
No, the signal's definitely
coming from the moon.

09:50.220 --> 09:53.739
I'm blocking it, but it's trying
to break through. Doctor! Donna!

09:53.774 --> 09:56.056
That was her, that was your friend.

09:56.091 --> 09:58.304
Can you get her back? What was that?

09:58.339 --> 10:02.299
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
I'm trying to find the wavelength.

10:02.334 --> 10:04.716
I'm being blocked. Professor?

10:04.751 --> 10:07.099
Just a moment. It's important.

10:07.134 --> 10:09.100
I have two shadows.

10:10.140 --> 10:12.419
OK. Helmets on, everyone.

10:12.454 --> 10:14.664
Anita, I'll get yours.

10:14.699 --> 10:18.899
It didn't do Proper Dave any good.
Just keep it together, OK?

10:18.934 --> 10:21.139
I'm keeping it together,

10:21.174 --> 10:23.184
I'm only crying.

10:23.219 --> 10:25.540
I'm about to die,
it's not an overreaction.

10:30.900 --> 10:31.980
Hang on.

10:32.940 --> 10:36.399
Oh, God, they've got inside. No, no,
no, I just tinted her visor.

10:36.434 --> 10:39.826
Maybe they'll think they're already
in there, leave her alone.

10:39.861 --> 10:43.219
Do you think they can be fooled
like that? Maybe. I don't know.

10:43.254 --> 10:45.837
It's a swarm, it's not like we chat.

10:45.872 --> 10:48.420
Can you still see in there?
Just about.

10:48.455 --> 10:50.384
Just... Just stay back.

10:50.419 --> 10:53.785
Professor, a quick word, please.
What? Down here. What is it?

10:53.820 --> 10:57.700
Like you said, there are five people
still alive in this room. Yeah, so?

10:57.735 --> 10:59.185
So...

10:59.220 --> 11:01.419
why are there six?

11:05.980 --> 11:09.019
Hey! Who turned out the lights? Run!

11:09.054 --> 11:11.620
Hey! Who turned out the lights?

11:15.780 --> 11:20.099
Hey! Who turned out the lights?
Hey! Who turned out the lights?

11:20.134 --> 11:21.997
Here we are, Dr Moon.

11:22.032 --> 11:23.825
Mummy, I made you!

11:23.860 --> 11:26.820
Ooh, that's nice, Ella.
Where's the face?

11:26.855 --> 11:29.024
I don't know.

11:29.059 --> 11:31.379
Did you see Dr Moon? Did he leave?

11:31.414 --> 11:32.384
Daddy!

11:32.419 --> 11:35.860
Hey! Hello, you two, come here!
Big hugs, big Daddy hugs!

11:35.895 --> 11:37.704
Look what I made!

11:37.739 --> 11:40.380
Oh, it's Mummy. It hasn't got a face.

11:40.415 --> 11:42.664
Did you see Dr Moon?

11:42.699 --> 11:45.060
No, why, was he here?
Yeah, just a second ago.

11:45.095 --> 11:47.180
You must have passed him.

11:50.099 --> 11:52.345
Are you all right?

11:52.380 --> 11:56.700
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine, it's just...
Just...

11:59.379 --> 12:00.659
Nothing.

12:03.500 --> 12:06.180
It's been a long day, that's all.

12:06.215 --> 12:07.740
I'm just tired.

12:10.380 --> 12:12.225
Are you OK?

12:12.260 --> 12:15.379
I said I was tired and...

12:16.980 --> 12:18.919
..and we put the kids to bed,

12:18.954 --> 12:20.859
and we watched television.

12:23.699 --> 12:27.179
Was that a letter? It's midnight.
Go and see what it is.

12:44.179 --> 12:46.579
"The world is wrong." What?

12:46.614 --> 12:48.944
For you. Weird, though.

12:48.979 --> 12:51.665
"Dear Donna, the world is wrong.

12:51.700 --> 12:54.699
"Meet me at your usual playpark,
two o'clock tomorrow."

13:06.900 --> 13:07.980
Nutter.

13:11.219 --> 13:13.260
Don't go. Please don't go.

13:20.499 --> 13:23.460
All right, you two,
off you go, no fighting.

13:44.900 --> 13:47.425
I got your note last night.

13:47.460 --> 13:49.540
The world is wrong,
what's that mean?

13:49.575 --> 13:51.917
No, you didn't. I'm sorry, what?

13:51.952 --> 13:54.259
You didn't get my note last night.

13:54.294 --> 13:55.820
You got it a few seconds ago.

13:56.940 --> 14:00.399
Having decided to come, you
suddenly found yourself arriving.

14:00.434 --> 14:04.227
That is how time progresses here,
in the manner of a dream.

14:04.262 --> 14:08.020
You've suspected that before,
haven't you, Donna Noble?

14:10.459 --> 14:15.140
How do you know me?
We met before, in the Library.

14:15.175 --> 14:16.944
You were kind to me.

14:16.979 --> 14:19.499
I hope now to return that kindness.

14:21.499 --> 14:23.419
Your voice...

14:24.459 --> 14:26.625
I recognise it. Yes, you do.

14:26.660 --> 14:30.220
I am what is
left of Miss Evangelista.

14:41.340 --> 14:43.745
Professor, go ahead,
find a safe spot.

14:43.780 --> 14:47.100
It's a carnivorous swarm in a suit,
you can't reason with it.
Five minutes.

14:47.135 --> 14:50.699
Other Dave, stay with him, pull him
out when he's too stupid to live.

14:50.734 --> 14:52.619
Two minutes, Doctor.

14:54.219 --> 14:55.904
Hey! Who turned out the lights?

14:55.939 --> 14:58.904
You hear that? Those words?
That is the very last thought

14:58.939 --> 15:03.199
of the man who wore that suit
before you climbed inside it
and stripped his flesh.

15:03.234 --> 15:07.459
That's a man's soul
trapped inside a neural relay,
going round and round forever.

15:07.494 --> 15:10.620
Now, if you don't have the decency
to let him go, how about this?

15:10.655 --> 15:12.585
Use him. Talk to me.

15:12.620 --> 15:15.824
It's easy, neural relay.
Just point and think.

15:15.859 --> 15:18.944
Use him, talk to me.
Hey! Who turned out the lights?

15:18.979 --> 15:23.419
The Vashta Nerada
live on all the worlds in this
system, but you hunt in forests.

15:23.454 --> 15:26.859
What are you doing in a library?
We should go. Doctor! In a minute.

15:26.894 --> 15:29.700
You came to a library to hunt, why?
Just tell me why?

15:35.260 --> 15:37.259
We...did not.

15:37.294 --> 15:39.259
Oh, hello.

15:40.100 --> 15:42.104
We did not.

15:42.139 --> 15:45.899
Take it easy, you'll get
the hang of it. Did not what?

15:45.934 --> 15:48.065
We...did not...come...here.

15:48.100 --> 15:51.780
Well, of course you
did, of course you came here.

15:51.815 --> 15:54.100
We come from here.

15:54.135 --> 15:55.785
From here?

15:55.820 --> 15:57.825
We hatched here.

15:57.860 --> 16:00.700
But you hatch from trees,
from spores in trees.

16:00.735 --> 16:03.580
These are our forests.

16:04.740 --> 16:07.379
You're nowhere near a forest,
look around you.

16:07.414 --> 16:10.465
These are our forests.

16:10.500 --> 16:13.060
You're not in a forest,
you're in a library.

16:13.095 --> 16:14.899
There are no trees in a...

16:16.019 --> 16:19.260
..library. We should go. Doctor!

16:19.295 --> 16:21.185
Books.

16:21.220 --> 16:22.700
You came in the books.

16:25.260 --> 16:30.459
Microspores in a million, million
books. We should go. Doctor!

16:30.494 --> 16:32.624
Oh, look at that.

16:32.659 --> 16:35.259
The forests of the Vashta Nerada,

16:35.294 --> 16:37.825
pulped and printed and bound.

16:37.860 --> 16:42.059
A million, million books,
hatching shadows.

16:42.094 --> 16:43.380
We should go. Doctor!

16:46.099 --> 16:48.065
Oh...

16:48.100 --> 16:50.140
Dave! Oh, Dave, I'm so sorry.

16:53.060 --> 16:55.664
Hey! Who turned out the lights?
We should go. Doctor!

16:55.699 --> 16:58.825
I'm stupid, I talk too much,
this gob doesn't stop for anything.

16:58.860 --> 17:03.580
Want to know the only reason
I'm still alive?
Always stay near the door.

17:23.980 --> 17:28.900
I suggested we meet here because
a playground is the easiest
place to see it, to see the lie.

17:28.935 --> 17:32.140
What lie?
The children, look at the children.

17:33.660 --> 17:35.944
Why do you wear that veil?

17:35.979 --> 17:38.659
If I had a face like yours,
I wouldn't hide it.

17:38.694 --> 17:40.219
You remember my face, then?

17:42.820 --> 17:47.140
The memories are all still there -
the Library, the Doctor, me.

17:47.175 --> 17:49.500
You've just been
programmed not to look.

17:52.299 --> 17:54.580
Sorry, but...you're dead.

17:55.140 --> 17:58.540
In a way, we're all
dead here, Donna.

17:58.575 --> 18:00.557
We are the dead of the Library.

18:00.592 --> 18:02.505
Well, what about the children?

18:02.540 --> 18:05.539
The children aren't dead.
My children aren't dead.

18:05.574 --> 18:07.465
Your children were never alive.

18:07.500 --> 18:10.780
Don't you say that. Don't you dare
say that about my children!

18:10.815 --> 18:12.425
Look at your children.

18:12.460 --> 18:16.180
Look at all of them, really look.
They're not real.

18:16.215 --> 18:18.300
Do you see it now?
They're all the same.

18:20.179 --> 18:24.939
All the children of this world,
the same boy and the same
girl, over and over again.

18:24.974 --> 18:26.744
Stop it.

18:26.779 --> 18:30.820
Just stop it! Why are you doing
this? Why are you wearing that veil?

18:53.659 --> 18:58.180
You know...it's funny, I keep
wishing the Doctor was here.

18:58.215 --> 19:00.620
The Doctor is here, isn't he?

19:00.655 --> 19:02.859
He's coming back, right?

19:06.380 --> 19:12.259
You know when you see a photograph
of someone you know, but it's
from years before you knew them?

19:12.294 --> 19:16.219
It's like they're not
quite...finished,
they're not done yet.

19:17.860 --> 19:20.584
Well...yes, the Doctor's here.

19:20.619 --> 19:24.300
He came when I called,
just like he always does.

19:25.700 --> 19:28.380
But not MY Doctor.

19:32.020 --> 19:33.859
Now my Doctor...

19:35.860 --> 19:39.699
I've seen whole armies
turn and run away.

19:40.940 --> 19:44.599
And he'd just swagger off
back to his TARDIS

19:44.634 --> 19:48.259
and open the doors with
a snap of his fingers.

19:50.060 --> 19:53.380
The Doctor...in the TARDIS...

19:54.579 --> 19:58.540
Next stop - everywhere. Spoilers!

20:01.020 --> 20:04.080
Nobody can open a TARDIS
by snapping their fingers.

20:04.115 --> 20:07.140
It doesn't work like that.
It does for the Doctor.

20:07.175 --> 20:09.117
I am the Doctor.

20:09.152 --> 20:11.059
Yeah. Some day.

20:13.660 --> 20:15.940
How are you doing?
Where's Other Dave?

20:15.975 --> 20:17.580
Not coming, sorry.

20:19.019 --> 20:23.740
Well, if they've taken him,
why haven't they gotten me yet?
I don't know.

20:23.775 --> 20:26.859
Maybe tinting your
visor's making a difference.

20:26.894 --> 20:28.944
It's making a difference all right.

20:28.979 --> 20:31.705
No-one's ever going
to see my face again.

20:31.740 --> 20:35.660
Can I get you anything?
An old age would be nice.

20:35.695 --> 20:37.184
Anything you can do?

20:37.219 --> 20:39.700
I'm all over it. Doctor...

20:41.700 --> 20:43.820
When we first met you...

20:44.860 --> 20:46.904
..you didn't trust Professor Song.

20:46.939 --> 20:50.299
And then she whispered a word
in your ear, and you did.

20:51.900 --> 20:54.184
My life so far...

20:54.219 --> 20:55.899
I could do with a word like that.

20:55.934 --> 20:58.299
What did she say?

21:01.580 --> 21:05.220
Give a dead girl a break.
Your secrets are safe with me.

21:05.255 --> 21:06.497
Safe.

21:06.532 --> 21:07.740
What?

21:09.420 --> 21:14.899
Safe. You don't say saved,
nobody says saved, you say safe.
The data fragment! What did it say?

21:14.934 --> 21:18.899
"4,022 people saved. No survivors."
Doctor?

21:20.139 --> 21:23.465
Nobody says saved,
nutters say saved, you say safe.

21:23.500 --> 21:30.619
But you see, it didn't mean safe, it
meant...it literally meant...saved!

21:30.654 --> 21:32.700
What happened to your face?

21:32.735 --> 21:34.824
Transcription errors.

21:34.859 --> 21:38.340
It destroyed my face, did
wonders for my intellect.

21:38.375 --> 21:40.339
I'm a very poor copy of myself.

21:40.374 --> 21:42.025
'Where are we?'

21:42.060 --> 21:44.904
Why are the children all the same?

21:44.939 --> 21:48.979
The same pattern over and over.
It saves an awful lot of space.

21:49.014 --> 21:50.740
Space?

21:52.019 --> 21:53.185
Cyberspace.

21:53.220 --> 21:55.585
No! Don't tell, you mustn't tell!

21:55.620 --> 21:59.464
See, there it is, right there!
A hundred years ago,
massive power surge,

21:59.499 --> 22:04.104
all the teleports going at once.
Soon as the Vashta Nerada hit
their hatching cycle, they attack.

22:04.139 --> 22:08.539
Someone hits the alarm, the computer
tries to teleport everyone out.
It tried to teleport 4,022 people?

22:08.574 --> 22:12.620
It succeeded, pulled 'em all out,
but nowhere to send them,
nowhere safe in the Library.

22:12.655 --> 22:17.185
Vashta Nerada growing
all beamed up and nowhere to go.

22:17.220 --> 22:21.340
They're stuck in the system,
waiting to be sent, like emails.

22:21.375 --> 22:23.137
So what's a computer to do?

22:23.172 --> 22:24.900
What does a computer always do?

22:24.935 --> 22:27.340
It saved them.

22:28.740 --> 22:33.859
The Library, a whole world of books,
and right at the core, the
biggest hard drive in history.

22:33.894 --> 22:37.740
The index to everything
ever written, backup copies
of every single book.

22:37.775 --> 22:42.580
The computer saved 4,022 people
the only way a computer can.

22:42.615 --> 22:45.584
It saved them to the hard drive.

22:45.619 --> 22:49.539
Your physical self is stored in
the library as an energy signature.

22:49.574 --> 22:53.459
It can be actualised again whenever
you or the Library requires.

22:53.494 --> 22:54.899
The Library?

22:56.220 --> 23:00.700
If my face ends up on one of those
statues... You remember the statues?

23:02.940 --> 23:05.659
Wait, no, just...hang on.

23:06.619 --> 23:09.299
So...this isn't the real me?

23:09.334 --> 23:11.837
This isn't my real body.

23:11.872 --> 23:14.305
But I've been dieting!

23:14.340 --> 23:17.140
What you see around you,
this entire world

23:17.175 --> 23:19.699
is nothing more
than virtual reality.

23:22.660 --> 23:24.580
So why do you look like that?

23:25.380 --> 23:27.065
I had no choice.

23:27.100 --> 23:31.144
You teleported.
You're a perfect reproduction.

23:31.179 --> 23:35.580
I was just a data ghost
caught in the Wi-Fi and
automatically uploaded.

23:35.615 --> 23:39.340
And it made you clever? We're
only strings of numbers in here.

23:39.375 --> 23:42.860
I think a decimal point
may have shifted in my IQ.

23:42.895 --> 23:45.905
But my face has been
the bigger advantage.

23:45.940 --> 23:49.380
I have the two qualities you
require to see absolute truth.

23:49.415 --> 23:52.140
I am brilliant...and unloved.

23:55.260 --> 23:56.900
If this is all a dream...

23:59.339 --> 24:00.744
..whose dream is it?

24:00.779 --> 24:05.340
It's hard to see everything in
the data core, even for me,
but there is a word.

24:05.375 --> 24:07.260
Just one word.

24:08.940 --> 24:10.059
CAL.

24:14.699 --> 24:16.145
Mummy! My knee!

24:16.180 --> 24:18.825
Oh, look at that knee!

24:18.860 --> 24:21.780
Oh, look at that silly old knee!

24:21.815 --> 24:24.665
She's not real. They're fictions.

24:24.700 --> 24:29.179
I'm sorry, but now that
you understand that,
you won't be able to keep a hold.

24:29.214 --> 24:31.265
They are sustained
only by your belief.

24:31.300 --> 24:34.860
You don't know, you don't
have children. Neither do you.

24:36.580 --> 24:39.704
Donna, for your own sake,
let them go!

24:39.739 --> 24:44.300
Stop it! You'll spoil everything!
I hate you, you're going to ruin
everything! Stop it!

24:44.335 --> 24:45.700
Sweetie, what's wrong?

24:46.980 --> 24:48.499
Shut up!

24:51.100 --> 24:53.659
Daddy! No! Daddy!

24:57.740 --> 25:01.339
What is it? What's wrong?

25:02.340 --> 25:06.139
'Autodestruct enabled in 20 minutes.'

25:07.699 --> 25:11.940
Mummy, what did the lady mean?
Are we not real?

25:11.975 --> 25:15.025
Where are we going? Home!

25:15.060 --> 25:17.539
That was quick, wasn't it, Mummy?

25:18.860 --> 25:22.180
Mummy, what's wrong with the sky?

25:26.060 --> 25:29.340
What's maximum erasure? 20 minutes,
this planet'll crack like an egg.

25:29.375 --> 25:32.659
No! No, it's all right,
the Doctor Moon will stop it.

25:32.694 --> 25:34.544
It's programmed to protect CAL.

25:34.579 --> 25:36.705
Now, you really must stop this,
you know.

25:36.740 --> 25:41.020
You've forgotten again it was you
who saved all those people,
haven't you?

25:41.055 --> 25:43.260
And then you remembered.

25:43.340 --> 25:45.660
No! No, no, no, no, no, no!

25:51.259 --> 25:57.060
'All Library systems
are permanently offline,
sorry for any inconvenience.

25:57.095 --> 26:05.060
'Shortly...' We need to stop
this, we've got to save CAL.

26:05.095 --> 26:07.020
It's at the core of the planet.

26:07.055 --> 26:09.780
Well, then...let's go.

26:17.499 --> 26:18.979
Gravity platform!

26:20.820 --> 26:22.740
I bet I like you.

26:22.775 --> 26:24.220
Oh, you do!

26:33.499 --> 26:35.499
Mummy, you're hurting my hand.

26:37.060 --> 26:41.220
You just...
You just stay where I can see you.

26:41.255 --> 26:43.539
You don't get out of my sight.

26:43.574 --> 26:45.820
Is it bedtime?

26:55.420 --> 26:57.025
OK.

26:57.060 --> 26:59.220
That was lovely, wasn't it?

26:59.255 --> 27:01.345
That was a lovely bedtime.

27:01.380 --> 27:07.339
We had warm milk, and we watched
cartoons, and then Mummy read
you a lovely bedtime story.

27:08.740 --> 27:12.859
Mummy, Joshua and me,
we're not real, are we?

27:12.894 --> 27:14.824
Of course you're real.

27:14.859 --> 27:18.984
You're as real as anything.
Why do you say that?

27:19.019 --> 27:23.779
But, Mummy, sometimes, when you're
not here, it's like we're not here.

27:23.814 --> 27:25.819
Even when you close your eyes.

27:25.854 --> 27:28.019
We just stop.

27:45.859 --> 27:47.639
No! Please!

27:47.674 --> 27:49.420
No, PLEASE!

27:50.299 --> 27:51.259
No!

27:52.299 --> 27:54.279
No, no!

27:54.314 --> 27:56.260
NO!

28:02.500 --> 28:04.979
'Autodestruct in 15 minutes.'

28:05.420 --> 28:08.744
The Data Core! Over 4,000
living minds, trapped inside it.

28:08.779 --> 28:12.859
Yeah, well they won't be living much
longer, we're running out of time.

28:14.220 --> 28:16.500
Help me. Please help me.

28:16.535 --> 28:18.780
Please, please help me!

28:25.060 --> 28:28.264
Help me. Please, help me.

28:28.299 --> 28:31.699
What's that? Was that a child?
Computer's in sleep mode.

28:31.734 --> 28:34.660
I can't wake it up. I'm trying.

28:43.380 --> 28:45.460
Doctor, these readings!

28:47.219 --> 28:49.939
I know, you'd think
it was...dreaming.

28:49.974 --> 28:52.584
It is dreaming...of a normal life,

28:52.619 --> 28:56.179
and a lovely Dad,
and of every book ever written.

28:56.700 --> 28:58.800
Computers don't dream.

28:58.835 --> 29:00.907
'Help me. Please help me.'

29:00.942 --> 29:02.980
No. But little girls do.

29:15.140 --> 29:17.579
Please help me. Please help me.

29:17.614 --> 29:19.225
Oh, my God!

29:19.260 --> 29:21.544
It's the little girl.

29:21.579 --> 29:24.700
The girl we saw in the computer.

29:24.735 --> 29:26.260
She's not in the computer.

29:27.780 --> 29:29.500
In a way, she is the computer.

29:30.619 --> 29:32.100
The main command node.

29:32.135 --> 29:34.697
This is CAL.

29:34.732 --> 29:37.225
CAL is a child!

29:37.260 --> 29:41.420
A child hooked up to a mainframe??
Why didn't you tell me this!
I needed to know this!

29:41.455 --> 29:42.900
Because she's family!

29:45.779 --> 29:46.819
CAL...

29:48.019 --> 29:49.860
..Charlotte Abigail Lux.

29:51.020 --> 29:53.340
My grandfather's youngest daughter.

29:55.420 --> 30:01.380
She was dying,
so he built her a Library,
and put her living mind inside,

30:01.415 --> 30:03.984
with a moon to watch over her,

30:04.019 --> 30:08.580
and all of human history
to pass the time, any era to
live in, any book to read.

30:10.140 --> 30:12.939
She loved books more than anything.

30:12.974 --> 30:15.145
He gave her them all.

30:15.180 --> 30:19.620
He asked only that she be
left in peace. A secret,

30:19.655 --> 30:22.585
not a freak show.

30:22.620 --> 30:26.820
So you weren't protecting a patent,
you were protecting her.

30:30.340 --> 30:32.340
This is only half a life, of course.

30:33.379 --> 30:35.305
But it's for ever.

30:35.340 --> 30:37.220
And then the shadows came.

30:37.255 --> 30:40.139
Shadows. I have to...

30:40.174 --> 30:42.060
I have to save.

30:43.620 --> 30:45.099
Have to save...

30:45.134 --> 30:46.579
And she saved them.

30:47.539 --> 30:50.425
She saved everyone in the Library,

30:50.460 --> 30:54.584
folded them into her dreams
and kept them safe.

30:54.619 --> 30:58.185
Then why didn't she tell us?
Because she's forgotten.

30:58.220 --> 31:04.059
She's got over 4,000 living minds
chatting away inside her head,
it must be like...

31:04.094 --> 31:06.544
being...well, me.

31:06.579 --> 31:10.304
So what do we do? Easy!
'Autodestruct in ten minutes.'

31:10.339 --> 31:13.419
We beam all the people out of the
data core, the computer will
reset and stop the countdown.

31:13.454 --> 31:17.345
Difficult, Charlotte doesn't
have enough memory space left
to make the transfer. Easy!

31:17.380 --> 31:21.579
I'll hook myself up to the computer
and she can borrow my memory space!
It'll kill you stone dead.

31:21.614 --> 31:24.597
Yeah, it's easy to criticise.
It'll burn out both your hearts.

31:24.632 --> 31:27.545
I'll try my hardest not to die.
It's my main thing. Doctor!

31:27.580 --> 31:31.740
You and Luxy-boy, back up to the
main Library. Prime any data cells
you can find for maximum download,

31:31.775 --> 31:35.580
and before you say anything else,
Professor, can I just mention,
shut up!

31:35.615 --> 31:37.837
Ha! I hate you sometimes!

31:37.872 --> 31:40.025
I know! Mr Lux, with me!

31:40.060 --> 31:42.219
Anita, if he dies, I'll kill him!

31:43.260 --> 31:45.104
What about the Vashta Nerada?

31:45.139 --> 31:49.020
These are their forests. I'll seal
Charlotte inside her little world,
take everybody else away.

31:49.055 --> 31:51.625
The shadows can swarm
to their hearts' content.

31:51.660 --> 31:56.659
So you think they're just gonna let
us go? Best offer they're gonna get.
You're gonna make 'em an offer?

31:56.694 --> 32:02.060
They'd better take it, cos right
now, I'm finding it very hard to
make any kind of offer at all.

32:02.095 --> 32:03.584
I really liked Anita.

32:03.619 --> 32:07.620
She was brave, even when she was
crying, and she never gave in.
And you ate her.

32:10.419 --> 32:12.424
But I'm gonna let that pass.

32:12.459 --> 32:15.545
Just as long as you let them pass.

32:15.580 --> 32:19.740
How long have you known?
I counted the shadows.

32:19.775 --> 32:21.340
You only have one now.

32:23.499 --> 32:26.340
She's nearly gone. Be kind.

32:26.375 --> 32:28.339
These are our forests.

32:28.374 --> 32:29.904
We are not kind.

32:29.939 --> 32:33.460
I'm giving you back your forests,
but you are giving me them.

32:33.495 --> 32:35.585
You are letting them go.

32:35.620 --> 32:38.379
These are our forests.
They are our meat.

32:42.540 --> 32:44.140
Don't play games with me.

32:45.419 --> 32:53.100
You just killed someone I like,
that is not a safe place to stand.

32:54.899 --> 32:56.460
Look me up.

33:08.860 --> 33:10.500
You have one day.

33:14.779 --> 33:18.660
Anita! I'm sorry. She's been dead
a while now. I told you to go.

33:18.695 --> 33:21.299
Lux can manage without me.

33:22.660 --> 33:23.899
But you can't.

33:29.299 --> 33:32.299
'Autodestruct in two minutes.'

33:35.340 --> 33:38.419
Oh, no, no, no, no, come on,
what are you doing? That's my job.

33:38.454 --> 33:41.465
Oh, and I'm not allowed to
have a career, I suppose?

33:41.500 --> 33:45.064
Why am I handcuffed? Why do you
even have handcuffs? Spoilers!

33:45.099 --> 33:48.820
Stop this now, this is gonna
kill you! I'd have a chance,
you don't have any.

33:48.855 --> 33:51.625
You wouldn't have a chance,
and neither do I.

33:51.660 --> 33:55.740
I'm timing it for the end
of the countdown, there'll be
a blip in the command flow.

33:55.775 --> 33:59.580
That way it should improve our
chances of a clean download.
River! Please! No!

33:59.615 --> 34:03.339
Funny thing is, this means you've
always known how I was going to die.

34:03.374 --> 34:06.500
All the time we've been together,
you knew I was coming here.

34:07.780 --> 34:14.060
The last time I saw you, the real
you, the future you, I mean -
you turned up on my doorstep,

34:14.094 --> 34:16.139
with a new haircut and a suit.

34:17.539 --> 34:21.420
You took me to Darillium
to see the singing towers.

34:22.458 --> 34:24.498
What a night that was!

34:24.534 --> 34:26.817
The towers sang

34:26.851 --> 34:29.065
and you cried.

34:29.100 --> 34:33.820
You wouldn't tell me why,
but I suppose you knew it was time.

34:33.855 --> 34:36.498
My time. Time to come to the Library.

34:37.620 --> 34:41.458
You even gave me your screwdriver -
that should've been a clue.

34:41.494 --> 34:44.065
There's nothing you can do.

34:44.100 --> 34:48.539
You can let me do this! If you die
here, it'll mean I've never met you.

34:48.574 --> 34:52.978
Time can be rewritten. Not those
times. Not one line! Don't you dare!

34:54.540 --> 34:56.225
It's OK.

34:56.260 --> 34:59.299
It's OK, it's not over for you.
You'll see me again.

35:00.379 --> 35:02.819
You've got all of that to come.

35:02.854 --> 35:05.259
You and me, time and space.

35:06.060 --> 35:09.060
You watch us run!

35:10.740 --> 35:13.664
River, you know my name!
'Autodestruct in...'

35:13.699 --> 35:18.019
You whispered my name in my ear.
'..nine, eight, seven...

35:18.054 --> 35:22.339
There's only one reason I
would ever tell anyone my name.

35:22.374 --> 35:23.980
There's only one time I could...

35:24.015 --> 35:25.259
Shh, now!

35:27.379 --> 35:30.379
Spoilers!
'..three, two, one...'

35:36.620 --> 35:37.580
Donna?

35:38.659 --> 35:40.544
What's happening?

35:40.579 --> 35:44.139
I don't know, but it's not real.
Nothing here's real.

35:44.174 --> 35:46.459
The whole world, everything,
none of it's real.

35:47.779 --> 35:49.100
Am I real?

35:50.899 --> 35:54.340
Course you're real,
I know you're real.

35:55.659 --> 35:59.260
Oh, God, oh, God,
I hope you're real.

36:04.819 --> 36:06.704
I'll find you!

36:06.739 --> 36:08.940
I promise you, I'll find you!

36:17.459 --> 36:19.399
Excuse me.

36:19.434 --> 36:21.305
What happened?

36:21.340 --> 36:23.340
How did we get here?

36:24.900 --> 36:26.744
Look at you.

36:26.779 --> 36:31.579
You're back. You're all back.
He did it!

36:33.139 --> 36:35.379
You're all back. Look at you!

36:35.414 --> 36:37.099
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

36:46.500 --> 36:48.299
Look at that!

36:50.219 --> 36:51.940
Look at that. He did it.

36:53.700 --> 36:56.020
4,022 people!

36:56.055 --> 36:57.499
Saved!

37:20.100 --> 37:23.144
Please be patient. Only three
can teleport at a time.

37:23.179 --> 37:27.539
Do not state your intended
destination until you arrive in...

37:27.574 --> 37:29.020
Any luck?

37:30.619 --> 37:33.704
There wasn't even anyone called
Lee in the Library that day.

37:33.739 --> 37:40.060
Suppose he could have had
a different name out here,
but let's be honest,

37:40.095 --> 37:41.700
he wasn't real, was he?

37:42.540 --> 37:43.980
Maybe not.

37:45.099 --> 37:46.980
I made up the perfect man.

37:47.739 --> 37:51.339
Gorgeous, adores me,
and hardly able to speak a word.

37:52.060 --> 37:53.505
What does that say about me?

37:53.540 --> 37:57.740
Everything.
Sorry, did I say everything?
I meant to say "nothing".

37:57.775 --> 38:01.060
I was aiming for "nothing",
I accidentally said "everything".

38:01.095 --> 38:04.219
'Stand right in the middle of
the teleport, please...'

38:04.254 --> 38:06.425
What about you?

38:06.460 --> 38:10.780
Are you all right?
I'm always all right.

38:12.379 --> 38:16.540
Is "all right"
special Time Lord code for...

38:16.575 --> 38:19.500
"really not all right at all"? Why?

38:21.060 --> 38:22.700
Cos I'm all right, too.

38:27.339 --> 38:29.340
Come on.

38:55.140 --> 38:57.020
Your friend...

38:57.055 --> 38:58.900
Professor Song...

39:00.939 --> 39:03.619
She knew you in the future,
but she didn't know me.

39:03.654 --> 39:05.024
What happens to me?

39:05.059 --> 39:09.099
Because when she heard my name,
the way she looked at me... Donna...

39:09.134 --> 39:11.299
This is her diary.

39:13.980 --> 39:15.420
My future.

39:19.059 --> 39:20.539
I could look you up.

39:22.459 --> 39:24.379
What do you think?

39:26.020 --> 39:27.580
Shall we peek at the end?

39:35.580 --> 39:37.619
Spoilers, right?

39:37.654 --> 39:39.059
Right.

39:53.500 --> 39:55.385
Come on.

39:55.420 --> 39:56.899
The next chapter's this way.

39:59.059 --> 40:03.220
When you run with The Doctor,
it feels like it will never end.

40:03.255 --> 40:07.260
But however hard you try,
you can't run for ever.

40:08.859 --> 40:14.664
Everybody knows that everybody dies,
and nobody knows it like The Doctor.

40:14.699 --> 40:21.580
But I do think
that all the skies of all the worlds
might just turn dark, if he ever,

40:21.615 --> 40:24.224
for one moment accepts it.

40:24.259 --> 40:27.745
Why? Why would I give her
my screwdriver? Why would I do that?

40:27.780 --> 40:32.019
Thing is, future me had years
to think about it, to think
of a way to save her,

40:32.054 --> 40:35.940
and what he did was give her
a screwdriver! Why would I do that?

40:35.975 --> 40:40.260
Oh! Oh! Oh, look at that!

40:41.540 --> 40:43.184
I'm very good!

40:43.219 --> 40:46.060
What have you done? Saved her.

40:51.979 --> 40:54.104
Stay with me!

40:54.139 --> 40:57.979
You can do it, stay with me!
Come on, you and me, one last run!

41:02.379 --> 41:04.660
Sorry, River, shortcut!

41:17.020 --> 41:19.620
Everybody knows that everybody dies.

41:22.979 --> 41:24.979
But not every day.

41:26.940 --> 41:28.380
Not today.

41:52.940 --> 41:55.105
It's OK. You're safe.

41:55.140 --> 41:57.665
You'll always be safe here.

41:57.700 --> 42:02.779
The Doctor fixed the data core.
This is a good place now. But I
was worried you might be lonely.

42:02.814 --> 42:05.340
So I brought you some friends.

42:05.375 --> 42:07.419
Aren't I a clever girl?

42:07.454 --> 42:09.260
Aren't we all?

42:13.500 --> 42:15.185
Oh, for heaven's sake!

42:15.220 --> 42:17.420
He just can't do it, can he?

42:18.259 --> 42:20.939
That man, that impossible man!

42:23.340 --> 42:25.660
He just can't give in.

42:43.219 --> 42:45.825
'Some days are special.

42:45.860 --> 42:49.019
'Some days are so, so blessed.

42:49.054 --> 42:52.179
'Some days, nobody dies at all.

43:19.579 --> 43:22.420
'Now and then, every once
in a very long while,

43:22.455 --> 43:24.264
'every day in a million days,

43:24.299 --> 43:29.340
'when the wind stands fair,
and The Doctor comes to call...

43:34.259 --> 43:35.779
'..everybody lives.'

44:05.700 --> 44:07.820
Sweet dreams, everyone.

44:15.580 --> 44:16.545
You be careful.

44:16.580 --> 44:20.020
Taking a big space truck with
a bunch of strangers across a
diamond planet called Midnight?

44:20.055 --> 44:21.597
What could possibly go wrong?!

44:21.632 --> 44:23.105
Enjoy your trip. Oh, I can't wait.

44:23.140 --> 44:26.500
What the hell is making that noise?

44:26.535 --> 44:29.537
It's trying the door.
There is no "it".

44:29.572 --> 44:32.504
Just tell me what the hell it is!
Down!

44:32.539 --> 44:35.299
If we're gonna get out of this,
then you need me!

44:35.334 --> 44:36.424
Like you're so special.

44:36.459 --> 44:40.079
Two people are dead.
Don't make it a third!

44:40.114 --> 44:43.699
It's coming for me, it's coming
for me. Oh!

44:43.734 --> 44:45.699
Aaaargh! Get out of there!
