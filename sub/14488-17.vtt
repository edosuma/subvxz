I got to go
drop a big one.

11:44.830 --> 11:46.957
Wow.
I can't believe it.

11:47.124 --> 11:49.877
One more promotion,
and I'll be a real detective,

11:49.960 --> 11:52.671
like Sherlock Holmes
or Speed Buggy.

Ain't you
heading home, Phil?

12:05.476 --> 12:08.229

finish this paperless work.

12:08.312 --> 12:09.897
Don't stay up too late.

remained unchanged
this fiscal year.

13:00.197 --> 13:01.365
That's not funny.

13:01.448 --> 13:03.951
It's not supposed to be funny.
It's a business meeting.

13:04.034 --> 13:06.036
Things used to be funny
around here.

13:06.120 --> 13:08.914

pants fell down.

13:08.998 --> 13:10.291
So, what changed?

13:10.374 --> 13:13.252
Only Fry could say,
and he's gone.

13:14.378 --> 13:16.964
Hey. Bender and Leela
are back from Pandora.

13:17.047 --> 13:18.299
How was it?
Awful.

13:18.382 --> 13:20.217
We had nothing to say
to each other,

13:20.301 --> 13:23.387
so we had to listen to Bender's
Eagles album for 27 hours.

13:23.554 --> 13:25.848
Beats talking to you,

Good afternoon,

13:33.939 --> 13:35.816
Sir, would you mind
stepping out of the building?

13:35.899 --> 13:37.943
Normally, when a cop
asks me that,

13:38.027 --> 13:40.321
I spray whip cream
in his eyes and run away,

13:40.404 --> 13:42.614
but to ditch
these losers, gladly.

13:44.533 --> 13:45.993
Benden
be honest with me.

13:46.076 --> 13:47.536
Are you planning
a big heist?

13:47.619 --> 13:49.413
Usually, but not
at the moment.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.999
I only ask 'cause the Oracle
thinks you're going to pull off

13:52.082 --> 13:53.792

next Thursday.

13:54.126 --> 13:56.086

you say?

Pray, continue.

13:58.005 --> 14:01.133
Are you familiar with
this particular location?

14:01.216 --> 14:03.844
I may have a burgling
familiarity with it.

14:03.927 --> 14:06.764
Does the word "Maltese"
mean anything to you?

14:06.847 --> 14:08.349
The Maltese Liquor,

14:08.432 --> 14:11.435
the strongest and most valuable

Bender, I'm only
telling you this

14:18.901 --> 14:20.611
so you can avoid
committing the crime.

14:20.944 --> 14:24.198

Maybe something
in the Oracle's prediction

14:36.919 --> 14:39.129
that I missed before,
due to incompetence.

I couldn't put my finger on it.
