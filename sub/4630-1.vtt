01:29.685 --> 01:32.653
Come on, let's go!
It's getting cold.

01:32.687 --> 01:34.287
Just a few more minutes.

01:45.830 --> 01:47.930
Did you guys hear that?

02:08.144 --> 02:10.078
No, no, no, no, no, no!

02:13.115 --> 02:14.314
( gasps )

02:49.005 --> 02:50.940
Falling behind there, sweetie?

02:50.974 --> 02:52.807
Worried about me,
are you, Bridget?

02:52.842 --> 02:54.241
( chuckles )

02:54.275 --> 02:56.877
No way, just leaves
more tips for me.

02:57.911 --> 02:58.911
Order up!

03:00.780 --> 03:01.780
Sophie!

03:03.949 --> 03:04.949
I was coming!

03:07.184 --> 03:09.486
All right, guys. Here you go.

03:12.655 --> 03:14.956
Amber, relax.
It's her first week.

03:14.990 --> 03:16.790
She's doing fine.

03:16.824 --> 03:18.492
- Yeah.
- Stop stressing.

03:20.026 --> 03:21.460
- Sorry about the wait.
- Mmm.

03:21.495 --> 03:23.495
Oh! Watch the merchandise,
fellas.

03:23.529 --> 03:25.128
I'm saving it
for my wedding night.

03:25.163 --> 03:26.730
That's OK.
I don't wanna buy it.

03:26.764 --> 03:29.031
I just wanna lease it
for tonight. ( chuckles )

03:29.066 --> 03:31.533
Sorry, but you and I both know
you can't afford it.

03:31.567 --> 03:33.068
Oh!

03:33.102 --> 03:34.902
So, you're new here or what?

03:34.936 --> 03:37.171
I'm Sophie. I just moved
to the city a couple months ago.

03:37.205 --> 03:38.571
I'm staying with my sister.

03:38.606 --> 03:40.240
OK. You should come
stay with me.

03:40.274 --> 03:41.340
( chuckles )

03:41.374 --> 03:42.641
Yeah, come on, baby.

03:42.675 --> 03:44.509
Bridget, can you cover for me?

03:48.513 --> 03:49.513
Is there a problem, here?

03:49.547 --> 03:51.547
Nothing I can't handle!

03:51.581 --> 03:53.882
OK. Well, you've had enough,
so I'm gonna cut you off.

03:53.916 --> 03:55.884
Amber, it's fine,
they're just joking around.

03:55.917 --> 03:58.252
No! He knows the rules!
It's hands off!

03:58.286 --> 03:59.552
- Aw!
- Amber!

04:03.956 --> 04:05.923
( shouting )

04:09.093 --> 04:10.727
Come on, big boy.

04:10.761 --> 04:12.394
Oh! OK.

04:20.733 --> 04:21.934
( choking )

04:25.204 --> 04:26.837
Bridget! Do something!

04:28.506 --> 04:30.072
Set up some shots.

04:30.107 --> 04:31.674
All right, boys!
That's enough of that!

04:31.708 --> 04:34.676
The action's over here.
Bring it in.

04:34.710 --> 04:37.211
We're gonna have some free
drinks on the house, right now.

04:37.245 --> 04:39.412
( cheering )

04:42.582 --> 04:46.617
That's right! That's what I'm
talking about! Yeah!

04:50.321 --> 04:52.054
Shots?

04:52.088 --> 04:53.656
( thumping on counter )

04:54.957 --> 04:57.592
Woman: Shots, shots, shots...!

05:00.161 --> 05:01.394
Woman: Yeah!

05:01.428 --> 05:02.762
( cheering continues )

05:14.971 --> 05:16.470
Oh!

05:17.906 --> 05:19.073
Hi, babe!

05:19.107 --> 05:20.307
It's quiet in here.

05:22.209 --> 05:24.176
Amber started a fight.

05:24.210 --> 05:26.411
Amber started a fight...

05:26.445 --> 05:27.545
and I missed it.

05:28.546 --> 05:30.347
Did anybody film it?

05:30.381 --> 05:31.515
Yeah.

05:31.548 --> 05:32.748
Sweet!

05:34.917 --> 05:36.785
Oh, nice!

05:36.819 --> 05:38.485
Babe!
( chuckling )

05:40.121 --> 05:41.120
Hey, Soph!

05:44.424 --> 05:45.757
OK.

05:45.792 --> 05:47.592
What happened this time?

05:47.626 --> 05:48.960
Ask the warden.

05:51.128 --> 05:52.128
This warden?

05:53.430 --> 05:54.597
I messed up tonight.

05:54.631 --> 05:56.098
Hmm, I'm sorry!

05:56.132 --> 05:57.799
I had it covered.

05:57.833 --> 06:00.601
You know, I'm not a kid anymore.

06:00.635 --> 06:03.603
Both: Yes, you are.

06:03.637 --> 06:07.472
If I wanted my every move
watched, I would've stayed
back home with mom and dad.

06:10.809 --> 06:12.709
Hmm!
So, what's up?

06:12.743 --> 06:15.410
Well, I am happy to announce...

06:15.445 --> 06:17.112
that the legendary...

06:17.146 --> 06:19.981
Jenner Branton's streak
of bad luck is officially kaput.

06:20.015 --> 06:22.749
I got us
a super sweet online deal...

06:22.783 --> 06:26.585
for a romantic, weekend,
getaway.

06:26.620 --> 06:28.052
- Really!
- Uh-huh...

06:28.087 --> 06:29.988
Where to?

06:30.022 --> 06:31.888
There's some new vacation spot
on some island off the coast.

06:31.923 --> 06:33.923
- Red Plum Island. Heard of it?
- No.

06:33.957 --> 06:37.092
It's supposed to be
beautiful there, though.
Clear skies...

06:37.126 --> 06:38.126
clear waters...

06:39.328 --> 06:41.328
there's a campsite...

06:41.363 --> 06:42.562
a marina...

06:42.596 --> 06:43.830
you and me, under the stars...

06:43.864 --> 06:46.531
snuggling by the fire, mmm...

06:46.566 --> 06:48.467
- Me like!
- Uh-huh.

06:48.501 --> 06:50.935
- But what's the catch?
- No catch.

06:50.969 --> 06:54.170
I... I just thought

06:54.205 --> 06:57.006
that we could bring
Sophie along.

06:57.040 --> 06:59.173
Jenner: Look.

06:59.208 --> 07:01.775
I know that things have been
really tense...

07:01.809 --> 07:03.644
since she moved in with you...

07:03.678 --> 07:05.645
and I just...

07:05.679 --> 07:07.412
I don't know, I just thought...

07:07.446 --> 07:08.913
you know? It'd be a good...

07:08.948 --> 07:11.115
a good opportunity to have
some fun...

07:11.149 --> 07:12.349
for a change.

07:14.118 --> 07:16.319
Thank you.

07:16.353 --> 07:19.221
Plus it was a lot cheaper
when I signed us up
for a group rate.

07:19.255 --> 07:21.489
Ah! OK, yeah.

07:22.556 --> 07:24.290
Soph!

07:24.325 --> 07:26.191
What do you say?
The three of us?

07:26.226 --> 07:27.593
Great outdoors...

07:27.627 --> 07:30.128
Sure, sounds like fun.

07:31.829 --> 07:34.765
And I don't work again
till Monday. ( slaps )

07:34.799 --> 07:36.265
Perfect!

07:36.299 --> 07:38.366
Well, looks like you've got
yourself a date.

07:38.401 --> 07:40.201
Two dates.

07:40.236 --> 07:42.302
Actually...

07:42.337 --> 07:44.303
we need four...

07:44.338 --> 07:45.838
to get the discount.

07:52.411 --> 07:53.643
What?

08:06.453 --> 08:10.455
( sighing )

08:10.489 --> 08:13.424
- How is it looking, Roger?
- ( chuckles )

08:13.458 --> 08:18.027
Ah, well, it looks like it
took a few stray rounds from
last night's little episode.

08:20.163 --> 08:21.662
It's totally busted.

08:21.697 --> 08:24.698
- Can you fix it?
-( sighs )

08:24.732 --> 08:28.033
Yeah, I can fix it.
There's a lot of delicate
equipment.

08:28.068 --> 08:30.568
I'm gonna swap parts out for
though, but I should get
it back online.

08:30.602 --> 08:32.503
It's gonna take a while, though.

08:32.538 --> 08:33.537
( sighs )

08:33.571 --> 08:35.871
Just get it done.

08:35.907 --> 08:38.340
It may be
the only shot we've got
at finding the damn thing.

08:38.375 --> 08:40.075
Or solar sonar?

08:47.181 --> 08:48.247
No.

08:48.282 --> 08:49.681
Where the hell is Cage?

08:49.716 --> 08:51.416
Here, ma'am.

08:51.451 --> 08:53.851
Did you find the test subject?

08:53.885 --> 08:55.585
My men have been out all night,
combing the waters.

08:55.619 --> 08:57.887
So far, we've come up
with nothing.

08:57.922 --> 08:59.388
I'm pretty sure it's dead,
ma'am.

08:59.422 --> 09:01.856
I don't wanna hear
about pretty sure.

09:01.890 --> 09:04.558
I need the thing dead!

09:04.592 --> 09:07.993
Do you understand the magnitude
of what it is we're dealing
with here?

09:08.028 --> 09:10.495
When Congress gets wind of this!

09:12.531 --> 09:15.966
We need to minimize the damage.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.835
With all due respect,
Dr. Palmer, I was brought on
as Chief of Security.

09:19.869 --> 09:22.738
I wasn't aware that
I was going to be chasing
monsters.

09:25.574 --> 09:29.174
You're here, Sergeant Cage,
because I was told
you were the best.

09:29.209 --> 09:30.676
Are you or are you not?

09:30.710 --> 09:31.877
Yes, ma'am.

09:34.279 --> 09:35.412
Find the shark.

09:35.446 --> 09:37.647
Before something worse happens.

10:12.038 --> 10:15.806
Hello! This is Jenner Branton.

10:15.840 --> 10:19.142
Yeah, I was just checking
about our reservations
for this weekend. Just--

10:21.211 --> 10:22.277
Great!

10:22.311 --> 10:25.112
You're a lifesaver.

10:25.147 --> 10:26.914
Jenner: I couldn't find
reservations anywhere!

10:26.948 --> 10:28.782
<i> It's James here, on The Tiger.</i>

10:28.816 --> 10:31.116
<i> This just coming in from
 the National Weather Service.</i>

10:31.151 --> 10:34.418
<i> Looks like we've got a severe
 storm advisory for tomorrow.
 Strom clouds are expected to
 move in</i>

10:34.453 --> 10:36.154
And I'm happy, she'll be happy.

10:36.188 --> 10:38.622
<i> ... by mid-morning,
 with high winds,
 and heavy rain...</i>

10:38.656 --> 10:41.824
<i>hitting the Coast before moving
 west along the Gulf Coast,
 later tonight.</i>

10:41.858 --> 10:43.491
<i> That is, if the current
 weather pattern holds.</i>

10:43.526 --> 10:45.293
<i> Everyone is advised
 to stay inside.</i>

10:45.327 --> 10:49.362
I'm just finishing
loading up the boat right now...

10:49.396 --> 10:51.697
so, we'll see you guys
pretty soon.

10:51.732 --> 10:54.366
<i>...while we wait out the storm.</i>

10:54.400 --> 10:57.201
All right.
Well, we'll see you then.

10:57.235 --> 10:59.369
All right. Thanks again. Bye.

11:00.838 --> 11:02.037
( sighs )

11:06.542 --> 11:07.675
( phone rings )

11:12.679 --> 11:14.045
( birds chirping )

11:15.981 --> 11:18.115
Hey, Mrs. Steele!
What's going on?

11:18.149 --> 11:20.216
What's this Sophie tells me
about you taking our girls...

11:20.250 --> 11:22.451
to some deserted island
for the weekend?

11:22.486 --> 11:24.152
Ah... It's Red Plum Island...

11:24.187 --> 11:26.854
and it's not deserted,
there's people there.

11:26.888 --> 11:29.123
Mmm, sound suspicious to me!

11:29.157 --> 11:31.157
Tell him I know where he lives.

11:31.192 --> 11:34.493
Ross has issued the first
of many death threats.

11:34.527 --> 11:38.595
Don't worry. Your girls are
in good hands. Scout's honor.

11:39.664 --> 11:41.198
We missed you and Amber...

11:41.232 --> 11:43.666
at Memo's birthday party
last week.

11:43.700 --> 11:45.900
Yeah, I know. Um...

11:45.935 --> 11:47.502
You know, we tried, um...

11:47.536 --> 11:49.903
but Amber had to fill in
for a friend at work--

11:49.938 --> 11:52.839
You don't have to make
excuses for her.

11:52.873 --> 11:55.173
I'm working on her.
Don't you worry.

11:55.208 --> 11:57.942
- I know you are.
- I gotta go to the shop.

11:57.976 --> 11:59.777
- I'll be back in a bit.
- Bye.

12:01.445 --> 12:03.712
You take care of my girls.

12:03.746 --> 12:06.014
Mrs. Steele: The next time
you decide to whisk
my only daughters...

12:06.049 --> 12:07.949
off to some deserted island--

12:07.983 --> 12:09.816
It's not deserted.

12:09.851 --> 12:12.319
Just... give me
a little more warning.

12:12.353 --> 12:14.153
OK. Well, how about...

12:14.187 --> 12:16.321
we just call you when we get
settled into the cabin, OK?

12:17.523 --> 12:19.056
OK.

12:19.090 --> 12:20.891
- Be careful!
- All right, bye, Mrs. Steele.

12:43.040 --> 12:44.707
This is nice, babe.

12:46.243 --> 12:49.576
- I get boyfriend points, huh?
- Definitely.

12:49.611 --> 12:50.611
All right!

12:50.645 --> 12:52.712
( Amber chuckles )

12:52.746 --> 12:54.814
Hey, what is that place?

12:55.848 --> 12:57.482
Um...

12:57.516 --> 12:58.583
Creepy?

12:58.618 --> 12:59.917
Looks abandoned.

13:24.902 --> 13:26.568
Hey, is that where we're going?

13:28.437 --> 13:31.341
Yeah, they said
we each get to pick out
one to stay in.

13:32.574 --> 13:35.373
I'm joking, Bridget.
That's not camping.

13:35.408 --> 13:37.157
That's the north side
of the island.

13:37.192 --> 13:39.182
That's where all the rich people
build their summer homes.

13:39.217 --> 13:40.544
See, now that it's
getting colder,

13:40.579 --> 13:43.546
most of them have already headed
back to the mainland.

13:43.581 --> 13:44.781
See up here?

13:52.921 --> 13:54.954
We're headed
to the south side.

14:20.139 --> 14:23.407
Wow! Very nice, babe!

14:25.943 --> 14:27.710
I'm impressed!

14:27.744 --> 14:29.210
What did I tell you, right?

14:29.245 --> 14:32.413
Mmm, I guess
the bad luck streak is over.

14:32.447 --> 14:34.148
Mmm...

14:36.817 --> 14:37.983
( Amber chuckles )

14:38.017 --> 14:39.217
Jenner: Let's go!

14:42.688 --> 14:43.887
Uh!

14:54.295 --> 14:55.995
What is this?

14:56.029 --> 14:58.597
Thought y'all said
we were staying at a resort.

14:58.632 --> 15:00.298
Did I say resort?

15:00.333 --> 15:02.466
I am... um...
I don't think I said resort.

15:02.500 --> 15:04.435
What did you expect?

15:04.469 --> 15:06.636
Um... How about...?

15:06.670 --> 15:09.604
full body massages, spas...

15:09.639 --> 15:13.441
little cabana boys,
running around, waiting on me
hand and foot.

15:13.475 --> 15:16.843
I can't afford that
on my salary.

15:16.877 --> 15:19.178
Well, I think it looks awesome.

15:19.212 --> 15:22.513
We can do a little fishing,
walk along the beach...

15:22.548 --> 15:23.648
It'll be perfect.

15:23.681 --> 15:24.881
Good.

16:13.815 --> 16:15.149
How are you?

16:15.183 --> 16:17.150
Hi! I'm Jenner Branton.

16:17.184 --> 16:19.184
You must be... Santa Claus.

16:22.888 --> 16:24.956
Jenner: Psst!
Hello?

16:24.990 --> 16:27.324
There's your cabana boy,
Bridget.

16:27.358 --> 16:31.526
Jenner: Um, a party... of four.

16:33.496 --> 16:36.897
Sophie: Reminds me of dad,
I think he'd like it here.

16:36.931 --> 16:40.666
Hey, you are the one
with all the good memories
of mom and dad.

16:40.701 --> 16:44.201
There's still time, you know?
They just don't know you
anymore.

16:44.236 --> 16:46.570
Reality check, Soph.
They never knew me.

16:46.605 --> 16:48.405
Besides, they have you.

16:48.439 --> 16:50.906
You are a much better daughter
than I ever was.

16:50.940 --> 16:53.608
( Jenner whistles ) Hello?

16:53.642 --> 16:57.344
Hello? Okie-dokie,
I think he's broken.
Are you there?

16:57.378 --> 17:00.446
- Anything?
- Um, we're checking in.

17:00.480 --> 17:04.782
I don't know if they told you
guys that we have four people
coming in for Jenner Branton.

17:04.817 --> 17:06.215
Oh, crap!

17:06.251 --> 17:08.385
Don't, don't; get out of here!

17:08.420 --> 17:10.987
How many times have I told
you to stay away from
behind the counter.

17:11.021 --> 17:13.521
And if it happens again,
I'm calling the sheriff.

17:13.556 --> 17:14.789
( laughing )

17:14.823 --> 17:16.190
Sorry about that!

17:16.223 --> 17:18.691
Homeless man,
always coming in here.

17:18.726 --> 17:21.093
Hey, look, I wanna apologize
for keeping you all waiting.

17:21.127 --> 17:22.828
I had breakfast burritos
this morning.

17:22.862 --> 17:25.663
And I'll tell one thing,
they gave me the squirts.

17:25.696 --> 17:27.030
( laughs )

17:27.065 --> 17:29.699
Anyway!
What can I do for you kids?

17:29.734 --> 17:31.901
Um, I'm Jenner Branton.

17:31.935 --> 17:34.936
Oh! Mr. Branton! Of course.

17:34.970 --> 17:37.237
Um...
( clearing his throat )

17:37.272 --> 17:40.606
Welcome to Red Plum Island
where all your dreams
come true. ( solemn )

17:40.641 --> 17:43.241
My name is Lester and I'm here
to attend to your every need.

17:43.276 --> 17:47.945
( chuckles ) If you could just
get your signature, here.
I'll get your keys.

17:47.979 --> 17:49.012
Thank you so much.

17:49.046 --> 17:50.413
We saw your cabins.

17:50.448 --> 17:52.548
Well, there'll be more cabins
soon.

17:52.582 --> 17:55.383
Still working on expanding
the guest accommodation.

17:55.417 --> 17:57.051
What did you say
your name was?

17:57.086 --> 17:58.885
- Lester.
- Lester, nice to meet you.

17:58.920 --> 18:02.421
Hey, so...  like, what is there
to do around here?

18:02.456 --> 18:04.956
Oh, well, um...
We have swimming...

18:04.990 --> 18:09.026
boating, fishing, parasailing,
but only on Saturdays.

18:09.060 --> 18:11.094
There are trails that go deep
into the woods...

18:11.128 --> 18:12.595
that are perfect for hiking.

18:12.629 --> 18:14.596
And we have
a brand new Redbox kiosk...

18:14.630 --> 18:17.064
outside of here,
if you want to watch a movie.

18:17.099 --> 18:19.732
And it's the only one
on the island.

18:19.767 --> 18:21.167
I'm pretty proud of that.

18:21.202 --> 18:23.202
And of course,
after the sun goes down,

18:23.236 --> 18:25.870
I do a little dinner show
over in our rec room.

18:25.904 --> 18:28.705
Well, I grill, make cocktails...

18:28.739 --> 18:31.308
I tell you, it gets
pretty wild up in there.

18:31.342 --> 18:33.476
Cocktails? Do you have a bar?

18:35.077 --> 18:36.578
Do we have a bar?

18:36.612 --> 18:37.612
( laughing )

18:39.013 --> 18:40.247
The bar!

18:42.683 --> 18:43.916
Jenner: Cool!

18:46.452 --> 18:49.320
Um... Where's the bartender?

18:53.857 --> 18:55.057
At your service!

18:55.091 --> 18:57.592
( laughing )

18:57.626 --> 19:01.495
This is perfect, Lester.
Thank you.

19:01.529 --> 19:05.231
OK. Well, I'm gonna head
to the beach.

19:09.667 --> 19:12.802
It's a little cold outside
to be tanning.

19:12.836 --> 19:15.137
If the sun's out,
I'm out!

19:15.171 --> 19:17.806
This body wasn't meant
for covering, anyway.

19:17.840 --> 19:19.940
She does have two points.

19:19.975 --> 19:24.110
So... I'll see you guys later.

19:24.145 --> 19:25.777
Sophie: Hey, Lester...

19:25.812 --> 19:27.045
What's that little boat
at the pier down the beach?

19:27.080 --> 19:28.880
We saw it when we came in.

19:28.914 --> 19:31.035
Oh! You must be talking
about the base.

19:31.070 --> 19:33.548
You know, it's not sure
what went on over there...

19:33.583 --> 19:35.851
but rumor has it they were doing
lots of testing...

19:35.885 --> 19:37.500
developing chemical warfare...

19:37.519 --> 19:39.786
new kind of mustard gas
or something, I don't know.

19:39.821 --> 19:42.022
They closed down in the 70s.

19:42.056 --> 19:44.657
You know,
there are old stories...

19:44.691 --> 19:47.392
about how the south would
fight off the sharks that
the current would bring down.

19:47.426 --> 19:49.827
Wait... Sharks?

19:49.861 --> 19:54.264
Well, sure!
In some of those old stories
we were nicknamed Shark Island.

19:54.298 --> 19:57.099
Wow! That doesn't sound
ominous, at all.

19:57.133 --> 20:00.434
Look, I've lived here my whole
life, and I've never seen
a shark.

20:00.469 --> 20:04.004
So trust me, you have nothing
to worry about.

20:31.390 --> 20:33.723
Man:
Check that out.

20:33.758 --> 20:35.125
Should we go over?

20:37.194 --> 20:38.693
What do you think?

20:38.727 --> 20:40.395
Man 2:
We should call Danny.

20:40.429 --> 20:43.764
Guys, seriously? Take a picture,
it lasts longer.

20:47.167 --> 20:49.201
Man 1: That's what I think
it is, right?

20:49.235 --> 20:51.101
It must've washed up last night.

20:58.274 --> 21:00.241
Whoa!

21:00.275 --> 21:02.810
People used to talk about
how this marina was
the place to be.

21:02.844 --> 21:04.978
But they closed down the base...

21:05.012 --> 21:07.913
and eventually
built another marina
over on the north island.

21:07.948 --> 21:12.150
So all of the wealthy people
build their luxurious homes over
there now.

21:12.183 --> 21:13.584
We saw that.

21:13.618 --> 21:15.351
But I have hopes
of growing this resort...

21:15.385 --> 21:17.687
and putting the south island
back on the map.

21:17.721 --> 21:18.787
( chuckles )

21:18.821 --> 21:20.789
Hey, guys!

21:20.823 --> 21:22.423
You've got to come see this!

21:30.163 --> 21:31.896
Do you believe it!

21:31.930 --> 21:33.564
Bridget: Isn't it awesome?

21:34.799 --> 21:37.967
Jenner: Wow!
This is so awesome!

21:38.001 --> 21:39.435
Sophie: It's a little gross.

21:39.469 --> 21:41.603
I wonder what happened to it.

21:41.637 --> 21:43.303
Amber: Jenner, don't touch it!

21:43.338 --> 21:45.172
I'm just looking at it.

21:47.274 --> 21:49.207
Jenner: Look at this hole!

21:51.944 --> 21:54.812
Jenner: Looks like
it's been bitten by something.

21:54.846 --> 21:56.412
Like what?

21:56.447 --> 21:58.081
Probably another shark.

21:58.115 --> 21:59.615
Jenner: No!

21:59.649 --> 22:02.350
I don't think sharks bite
other sharks.

22:02.384 --> 22:03.417
Do they?

22:03.452 --> 22:05.018
I don't think so.

22:05.052 --> 22:07.254
But I know one thing,
this is going on Instagram.

22:09.256 --> 22:12.090
Bridget, could you just...
don't?

22:12.124 --> 22:13.857
Baby.

22:13.891 --> 22:15.392
Take it easy.

22:15.426 --> 22:17.326
It's dead.
It's not gonna bite her.

22:18.562 --> 22:19.962
No...

22:19.997 --> 22:21.796
This is a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

22:21.831 --> 22:22.931
We should document it.

22:22.965 --> 22:24.331
No.

22:24.366 --> 22:26.266
She is right.
That's a good idea.

22:26.300 --> 22:28.968
I'm gonna take a picture
for Lester's website.

22:29.003 --> 22:30.636
Maybe that'll bring
some customers in.

22:30.670 --> 22:31.670
( laughs )

22:42.311 --> 22:44.646
Get away
from there!

22:44.679 --> 22:46.813
My bad, man.
Sorry about that, sheriff.

22:46.848 --> 22:48.781
We were just...ah...
taking some pictures

22:48.815 --> 22:51.016
for Lester's website.
We didn't mean anything.

22:51.050 --> 22:54.318
( screaming )

23:10.997 --> 23:13.131
Amber! Run!

23:29.109 --> 23:30.410
Mayday! Mayday!

23:32.445 --> 23:33.945
Ah!

23:33.980 --> 23:35.946
Please, please, please!
Get me out of here!

23:35.981 --> 23:37.747
We've got to go!

23:42.319 --> 23:45.119
( crying )

23:45.154 --> 23:46.586
Bridget, untie us!

23:48.623 --> 23:50.456
Keys! Keys!
Where are the keys!?

23:52.792 --> 23:53.825
Oh, my God.

23:55.494 --> 23:58.128
Jenner had them in his pocket.

23:58.163 --> 23:59.762
What does that mean?

23:59.797 --> 24:03.432
It means this boat
isn't going anywhere.

24:03.466 --> 24:04.733
No.

24:04.767 --> 24:06.233
No!

24:06.268 --> 24:08.635
Someone call the sheriff.

24:08.669 --> 24:09.736
No, no, no!

24:09.770 --> 24:11.770
No, don't come!
No!

24:11.805 --> 24:13.005
No!

24:30.517 --> 24:33.085
The storm's starting up
out there.

24:33.119 --> 24:35.287
It's all over the news.

24:35.321 --> 24:39.122
Straight-line winds.
Rain.

24:39.156 --> 24:41.257
They're telling everyone
to stay inside.

24:41.292 --> 24:43.625
Yeah. They'd be right.

24:43.660 --> 24:46.494
I had no idea there'd be
a storm this weekend.

24:48.863 --> 24:50.797
You think the girls are okay?

24:50.832 --> 24:52.732
They'll be fine.

24:55.234 --> 24:57.801
Jenner still hasn't called.

24:57.836 --> 24:59.937
Shouldn't they be
on the island by now?

24:59.971 --> 25:01.304
Will you leave them alone?

25:01.338 --> 25:03.306
You can't shelter them forever,
Davina.

25:06.275 --> 25:09.610
<i> You've reached Jenner.
 I am a little tied up
 at the moment.</i>

25:09.643 --> 25:13.345
<i> But if you leave a message,
 I will call you back
 as soon as I can.</i>

25:13.380 --> 25:14.446
<i> Thank you much.</i>

25:16.348 --> 25:18.249
No answer.

25:18.283 --> 25:20.283
Sophie is not answering either.

25:20.318 --> 25:21.752
Or Amber.

25:21.786 --> 25:24.520
That's typical.

25:24.554 --> 25:26.688
What if something happened
to the boat?

25:28.790 --> 25:32.291
Are you listening?!
They're not answering
their phones!

25:32.326 --> 25:35.994
Well, maybe they are
on the boat, and they can't
hear you over the motor.

25:36.028 --> 25:38.295
Maybe there's no reception
where they are.

25:38.330 --> 25:40.331
Sky's not always falling,
Davina.

25:40.365 --> 25:42.832
I knew something
like this would happened.

25:42.867 --> 25:44.533
Enough, okay?

25:46.269 --> 25:49.237
We raised two strong girls.

25:49.271 --> 25:50.604
They'll be fine.

26:34.334 --> 26:36.968
That shark was dead.

26:37.003 --> 26:38.336
We all saw it, right?

26:38.371 --> 26:39.703
It couldn't have been.

26:40.939 --> 26:42.539
It doesn't make any sense.

26:42.573 --> 26:44.908
We need to call the coastguard,
or something.

26:49.778 --> 26:50.878
Hey...

26:52.613 --> 26:54.613
I'm sorry about Jenner.

27:16.563 --> 27:18.197
Amber: Bridget, call for help!

27:18.231 --> 27:19.363
Bridget: Call who?

27:19.398 --> 27:21.466
I've one bar and no Internet.

27:23.701 --> 27:24.768
Ouch!

27:26.303 --> 27:28.570
Amber: We're drifting away
from the dock!

27:32.207 --> 27:34.241
What do we do?!

27:34.275 --> 27:36.375
We gotta get
off the boat!

27:36.410 --> 27:39.211
Wait, wait!
Stop, stop!

27:39.245 --> 27:40.445
We're trapped!

27:42.981 --> 27:44.247
Guys...

27:44.281 --> 27:46.216
The motor is destroyed.

27:46.250 --> 27:47.616
Bridget: We're screwed!

27:47.650 --> 27:49.518
Sophie: Amber, what do we do?

27:51.653 --> 27:53.787
The radio.

27:58.225 --> 27:59.191
( screams )

27:59.226 --> 28:00.425
Hello?! Hello?!

28:00.459 --> 28:02.493
Is anybody there?

28:02.527 --> 28:05.229
Mayday! Mayday! We need help!
We're in Red Plum Island

28:06.230 --> 28:07.597
<i>Amber: Mayday! Mayday!</i>

28:07.631 --> 28:09.197
<i> Can anyone hear me?!</i>

28:09.232 --> 28:11.533
This is a restricted access
military channel.

28:11.567 --> 28:14.767
- You need to contact the local
authorities on the island.
- They're dead!

28:14.802 --> 28:18.737
There's a shark washed up
on shore and it's eating
people and it's after us.

28:20.106 --> 28:21.272
<i> Can you hear me?</i>

28:24.442 --> 28:25.509
Hello?

28:26.577 --> 28:28.544
It's him, Sergeant Cage.

28:28.578 --> 28:31.079
Copy that. Hang on.
We're coming to get you.

28:31.113 --> 28:32.614
Hello? Can you hear me?

28:34.115 --> 28:35.349
Come in.

28:36.517 --> 28:37.783
Come in.

28:40.453 --> 28:42.720
Damn it, damn it.
I think the radio is dead.

28:42.754 --> 28:46.055
Come on! We need to go now!
Come on!

28:46.090 --> 28:49.491
Sophie: He's still there.
How are we going to get through?

28:49.526 --> 28:51.260
Okay, I'll create a distraction
and you guys run.

28:51.294 --> 28:52.960
No!

28:52.995 --> 28:55.662
Don't argue with me right now!
Just be ready.

28:55.696 --> 28:57.831
Hey! Hey!

29:00.433 --> 29:01.466
Over here!

29:03.769 --> 29:05.302
- Go! Go! Come on!
- No!

29:08.805 --> 29:10.139
Come on!

29:10.173 --> 29:11.439
Amber, come on!

29:52.068 --> 29:54.201
Oh, yeah. Okay.

29:54.236 --> 29:55.436
Cheers!

29:58.339 --> 29:59.939
We were there...
okay?

29:59.973 --> 30:03.908
And... we're flying
at 10,000 feet.

30:03.943 --> 30:06.910
And what did she do?

30:06.945 --> 30:10.012
- Totally freeze.
- Totally freeze.

30:12.582 --> 30:15.549
The pilot had to take us down.

30:15.584 --> 30:18.251
But to my defense,
we got a full refund.

30:18.285 --> 30:20.653
Besides, I said I was sorry.

30:20.688 --> 30:22.321
It's okay.

30:22.355 --> 30:24.488
Except the fact
that you're boring.

30:24.523 --> 30:26.290
- What?
- I love you anyway.

30:26.325 --> 30:28.425
What? I can be crazy!

30:28.459 --> 30:32.528
I defy you to name one crazy
thing that you've ever done.

30:35.064 --> 30:36.497
How about skinny-dipping?

30:40.467 --> 30:45.136
That water is ice cold.
No way you would
ever get in there.

30:45.171 --> 30:46.403
Yeah?

31:01.214 --> 31:02.815
( laughing )

31:05.517 --> 31:06.651
No way.

31:09.220 --> 31:10.786
( laughing )

31:12.322 --> 31:15.790
I take it all back!
You're a crazy girl!

31:38.439 --> 31:39.640
Steph?

31:39.674 --> 31:43.009
Stephanie! Stephanie! Steph!

31:43.043 --> 31:44.409
Steph!

31:49.981 --> 31:51.781
( screaming )

31:55.852 --> 31:58.119
Whoa! What happened?

31:58.153 --> 32:00.920
I heard screaming down on
the beach and I tried
calling the sheriff--

32:00.955 --> 32:02.155
He's dead.

32:03.690 --> 32:05.324
Amber, it's fine. I'm okay.

32:05.358 --> 32:06.958
What happened?

32:06.992 --> 32:09.159
There was a shark attack.

32:09.193 --> 32:10.694
Where's Mr. Branton?

32:12.863 --> 32:14.196
He's gone too.

32:15.331 --> 32:16.831
Crap.

32:16.866 --> 32:19.033
I dropped my cell phone,
somebody call 911.

32:19.067 --> 32:22.468
We don't have 911 on the island.
The most we have is the sheriff,

32:22.503 --> 32:24.670
and volunteer fire and EMTs.

32:24.704 --> 32:27.005
If you want anything else,
you've got to wait
for the mainland.

32:27.040 --> 32:28.706
But I don't think they're gonna
come out with this storm coming.

32:28.740 --> 32:30.807
There's a storm?

32:30.841 --> 32:34.143
Yeah, a big one.
It's been on TV all day.
You didn't hear?

32:34.177 --> 32:37.178
No. I talked to someone
from the military
over the boat's radio.

32:37.212 --> 32:39.414
I feel like they are the only
ones who can help us
at this point.

32:39.448 --> 32:43.349
We need to try to get back
in contact with them. Do
you have a a CB or...?

32:43.383 --> 32:45.284
- Maybe one in the back.
- Okay, okay.

32:45.318 --> 32:47.919
What good is that gonna do?
You said there's no one to call!

32:47.953 --> 32:49.653
It's just worth a try.
Can you please go help him.

32:49.688 --> 32:52.089
- Why me?
- Bridget.

32:54.525 --> 32:56.224
What is your problem?

32:56.259 --> 32:57.859
I can take care
of myself, you know?

32:57.894 --> 32:59.527
Yeah, so you keep telling me.

32:59.561 --> 33:02.195
On the dock, you should have
left me. I was fine.

33:02.229 --> 33:04.230
But instead, you came back
and it could have gotten you.

33:04.265 --> 33:05.230
But it didn't.

33:05.265 --> 33:06.565
But it could've!

33:06.599 --> 33:09.367
We already lost Jenner,
we can't...

33:09.401 --> 33:10.801
I can't lose you.

33:12.303 --> 33:15.037
It's better me than you.

33:15.072 --> 33:19.374
Eventually, you're going to have
to stop living in the past
and forgive yourself.

33:20.709 --> 33:22.376
Look what we found.

33:22.410 --> 33:24.777
Oh, my God. Great.

33:26.412 --> 33:28.280
- Try that.
- Okay.

33:33.484 --> 33:36.452
Hello? Hello?
Can anyone hear me?

33:38.455 --> 33:41.822
There's a shark on the shoreline
and it's killing people.

33:43.791 --> 33:44.957
Who is this?

33:46.293 --> 33:48.526
Are you with the military?

33:48.561 --> 33:50.428
My name is Dr. Diane Palmer.

33:50.463 --> 33:51.929
What is your name?

33:51.963 --> 33:53.297
Amber Steel.

33:54.398 --> 33:55.531
Where are you, Miss Steel?

33:55.566 --> 33:58.266
We are on the marina.

33:58.301 --> 34:01.402
Where is the shark now,
Miss Steel?

34:01.436 --> 34:03.269
I don't know, it...

34:03.304 --> 34:06.438
It attacked our boat
and then it swam away.

34:06.473 --> 34:08.540
Listen to me carefully.

34:08.574 --> 34:10.041
Is the shark dead?

34:10.074 --> 34:11.542
Did you kill it?

34:11.577 --> 34:14.377
Are you kidding?
No, we didn't kill it.

34:14.411 --> 34:18.980
It ate my boyfriend,
and it killed the sheriff.
Its face was...

34:19.014 --> 34:22.483
It looked like it had been dead
for days, but it was
still moving.

34:22.516 --> 34:26.819
Sit tight, Miss Steel.
I'm sending a professional
to deal with the situation.

34:28.621 --> 34:30.054
Everything is gonna be okay.

34:30.089 --> 34:31.621
<i>- Over and out.
- Amber: No, no, no!</i>

34:31.656 --> 34:35.091
Hello? Hello?
Wait? Oh, my... Hello?

34:35.126 --> 34:36.559
So, we just wait here then,
right?

34:36.594 --> 34:38.827
She said help is on the way.

34:38.862 --> 34:41.395
I mean, it's not like the
shark's gonna come on land.

34:41.429 --> 34:43.563
We just stay away
from the water,
and we'll be fine.

34:43.598 --> 34:45.799
No, I don't know.

34:45.833 --> 34:49.434
You saw that shark that got
Jenner, it seemed to move
just fine on land.

34:49.467 --> 34:52.536
If that thing is actually dead,

34:52.570 --> 34:54.737
then maybe it doesn't even need
to breathe.

34:54.773 --> 34:57.907
I mean, it could kill just as
easily on land as in water.

34:57.941 --> 35:01.076
Amber, it couldn't have been
dead. It just must've been
stunned or something.

35:01.110 --> 35:04.378
No, the hole in the side...
and that big... No!

35:04.412 --> 35:05.445
It was dead!

35:05.479 --> 35:07.247
And it just keeps killing!

35:08.748 --> 35:10.983
Okay. So like a zombie shark?

35:11.017 --> 35:12.283
What?

35:12.317 --> 35:13.951
( man screams )

35:18.088 --> 35:20.455
What are those people
doing in the water?

35:21.457 --> 35:23.357
( man screams )

35:23.391 --> 35:25.325
( screaming )

35:29.396 --> 35:31.530
Get away! Go, go, go!

35:33.532 --> 35:34.799
Woman: Help me!

35:36.700 --> 35:38.301
You have any guns
in the back?

35:38.335 --> 35:39.368
Yes, I have shot guns
for skeet shooting!

35:39.402 --> 35:40.836
- Get them now.
- Okay.

35:40.870 --> 35:43.271
Okay, I'm gonna go,
and you stay here.

35:43.305 --> 35:45.872
- No, I'm going with you.
- You don't even know
how to shoot a gun.

35:45.907 --> 35:50.075
Please, you think you are the
only one that dad taught how
to use a gun?

35:50.110 --> 35:51.409
Locked and loaded, ready to go!

35:51.443 --> 35:52.577
Okay.

35:52.611 --> 35:55.179
All right. Bridget, let's go.

35:55.213 --> 35:58.614
No way. I'm not dying
for those people.

35:58.649 --> 36:00.415
Damn it, Bridget.

36:00.449 --> 36:02.951
Can you think of someone other
than yourself for just once?

36:02.985 --> 36:04.585
Okay, y'all go.
I'll stay here with the CB

36:04.619 --> 36:06.986
and try to get
in touch with the coast guard.

36:07.021 --> 36:08.221
Okay?

36:11.024 --> 36:13.357
Hey! Hey!

36:16.561 --> 36:18.028
Move!

36:18.062 --> 36:22.197
- Help, help! Help us!
- Stop, get away!

36:22.231 --> 36:23.665
Help!

36:27.836 --> 36:30.336
- These bullets aren't
doing anything.
- Get it away!

36:33.673 --> 36:35.039
( gasping )

36:38.075 --> 36:39.275
What is that?

36:42.378 --> 36:43.945
( grunting )

36:45.214 --> 36:46.581
Get inside! Get inside!

36:55.487 --> 36:58.121
Amber! Amber!

36:58.156 --> 36:59.388
Amber!

37:07.495 --> 37:09.028
Hurry, come on, it's coming!

37:12.899 --> 37:15.032
Amber, come on,
get out of the water!

37:19.370 --> 37:20.669
( Amber moans )

37:32.112 --> 37:34.412
s more than one now.

37:34.447 --> 37:35.647
Thank you.

37:35.681 --> 37:36.747
Who are you?

37:36.781 --> 37:38.148
Sergeant Maxwell Cage.

37:38.183 --> 37:40.116
I'm Amber,
this is my sister Sophie.

37:40.150 --> 37:41.851
It was you
on the radio, right?

37:41.886 --> 37:43.252
We need to
get you inside, okay?

37:43.286 --> 37:45.786
No. Inside? We need
to get off this island.

37:45.821 --> 37:48.622
We're from the mainland.
We need to get back,
it took our boat.

37:48.656 --> 37:51.590
I understand that, but right now
we have to contain
the situation.

37:51.625 --> 37:53.125
What is the situation?

37:53.159 --> 37:54.525
That's classified
for now, ma'am.

37:54.560 --> 37:56.394
Classified?

37:56.428 --> 37:58.762
Those things ate my boyfriend!

37:58.796 --> 38:00.796
It was dead, and it just...

38:02.299 --> 38:03.332
Wait.

38:03.367 --> 38:05.300
Are you from the base?

38:05.334 --> 38:08.402
Lester said it was shut
down, but is still open?

38:08.436 --> 38:11.504
It would have to be. How else
did you get here so fast?

38:11.538 --> 38:13.505
What's going on?

38:13.539 --> 38:16.073
I heard there was chemical
warfare testing? Is that
what this is?

38:16.108 --> 38:18.409
Did you do something
to those sharks?

38:18.443 --> 38:20.510
Look, I'm not at liberty
to discuss anything until
we know what's going on.

38:20.544 --> 38:21.745
We need to get you inside, okay?

38:21.779 --> 38:23.879
No, that's not good enough!

38:25.681 --> 38:27.482
Bravo team, this is Alpha 1.

38:27.516 --> 38:28.982
What's you status, over?

38:30.952 --> 38:32.485
- What is it?
- Repeat, Bravo team.

38:32.519 --> 38:33.819
Give me a sit rep, over.

38:33.854 --> 38:35.487
What's going on?

38:35.521 --> 38:36.888
It's another attack.
It's my men.

38:36.923 --> 38:39.123
I need to get you inside.

38:39.157 --> 38:42.058
All right? You need to stay
somewhere safe until someone
comes to get you.

38:42.092 --> 38:43.459
Take us with you. We can help.

38:43.494 --> 38:45.928
No, you need to be safe.
Just stay there.

38:45.962 --> 38:49.563
No, I don't know if you realize,
Sergeant Cage, but nowhere
on this island is safe

38:49.598 --> 38:51.097
as long as they have us trapped.

38:51.132 --> 38:52.799
Unless you have more rockets.

38:52.833 --> 38:54.967
No, I only expected one
of the sharks.

38:55.001 --> 38:58.603
Then you're gonna need
our help if you want
to rescue your men.

39:00.672 --> 39:02.505
My vehicle's this way...

39:02.539 --> 39:04.941
Wait, what about Bridget?

39:04.975 --> 39:07.542
We can count on Bridget
to take care of herself.

39:07.576 --> 39:10.144
That's what she's best at.

39:10.178 --> 39:13.346
Mayday! Mayday!
This is Red Plum Island,
do you read? Over.

39:15.848 --> 39:19.216
Mayday! Mayday!
This is an emergency!
Do you read? Over.

39:22.586 --> 39:25.354
Amber: Stay here!
We'll be right back with help!

39:28.023 --> 39:29.490
What just happened?

39:29.525 --> 39:31.591
Did that dude just have
a rocket launcher?

40:09.652 --> 40:11.085
Oh, no.

40:13.954 --> 40:16.455
Bravo team,
this is Alpha 1 come in. Over.

40:17.790 --> 40:19.024
Bravo team.

40:25.496 --> 40:26.628
Bravo team.

40:26.663 --> 40:28.430
This is Alpha 1 come in. Over.

40:28.465 --> 40:30.031
Sergeant...

40:32.934 --> 40:34.401
They spent every shell.

40:34.435 --> 40:35.801
Still didn't stand a chance.

40:40.239 --> 40:42.039
Damn it.

40:42.073 --> 40:43.407
They are all dead?

41:03.187 --> 41:04.955
How is that possible?

41:11.127 --> 41:12.426
What happened to them?

41:14.629 --> 41:15.661
Over there.

41:23.068 --> 41:24.801
Is the blood drawing them in?

41:24.835 --> 41:27.003
What's wrong with them, though?
They're going nuts.

41:32.341 --> 41:33.974
Bruce.

41:34.008 --> 41:36.809
<i>Diane: Cage,
 what's the situation?</i>

41:36.843 --> 41:39.111
<i>Cage: The whole team is gone,
 ma'am.</i>

41:40.513 --> 41:42.414
And the shark?

41:42.448 --> 41:44.615
<i> He's still here,
 but we've got worse problems.</i>

41:44.649 --> 41:46.949
Subject Bruce has friends.

41:46.984 --> 41:48.584
More sharks?

41:48.619 --> 41:49.985
Affirmative.

41:50.019 --> 41:51.686
And they seem
to be infected, too.

41:52.988 --> 41:54.221
Oh, my God.

41:55.456 --> 41:57.791
How?

41:57.825 --> 42:01.292
<i> As far as I can tell,
 the infected sharks are
 killing the islanders.</i>

42:01.326 --> 42:04.128
The other sharks are swimming
in, they're eating what's left.

42:04.163 --> 42:06.530
It's like they're
being poisoned.

42:06.564 --> 42:09.999
They die when they
ingest the body parts

42:10.033 --> 42:11.800
and then they come back.

42:12.968 --> 42:14.701
And Bruce is just watching them.

42:14.736 --> 42:16.370
If I didn't know any better,

42:16.404 --> 42:18.171
<i> I would think that he's trying
 to turn them.</i>

42:18.205 --> 42:20.138
<i> I think he is trying
 to make more like him.</i>

42:20.173 --> 42:22.307
If they're turning
after eating the remains,

42:22.341 --> 42:26.242
that must mean that the
infection can spread to humans.

42:26.277 --> 42:28.211
To what extent,
I don't know.

42:29.879 --> 42:31.647
How is that possible?

42:31.681 --> 42:33.381
<i> I don't know that either.</i>

42:36.617 --> 42:37.617
( sobs )

42:42.655 --> 42:45.589
Ma'am. Please advise.

42:45.623 --> 42:47.957
<i> Contain the situation,
 Sergeant. However you can.</i>

42:47.991 --> 42:51.993
In the meantime,
I've gotta figure out
how to reverse this mess.

42:53.662 --> 42:55.629
Acknowledged. Over.

43:02.669 --> 43:04.735
( sighs )

43:04.770 --> 43:06.103
What'd she say?

43:22.915 --> 43:24.582
They totally left me here.

43:24.616 --> 43:26.350
What the hell?

43:26.384 --> 43:27.750
Yeah.

43:27.785 --> 43:29.652
That army guy don't need
their help.

43:29.687 --> 43:31.820
This is so like Amber.

43:31.855 --> 43:33.388
So like both of them.

43:33.423 --> 43:35.056
They are all
goody two-shoes.

43:35.090 --> 43:37.891
And wanna save
and help everybody.

43:37.925 --> 43:40.025
Actually, I think that's
a noble characteristic.

43:40.060 --> 43:43.128
- Shut up.
- OK.

43:43.162 --> 43:45.396
So sue me if
I don't wanna die.

43:45.431 --> 43:47.831
Does that
make me a bad person?

43:50.267 --> 43:54.069
I mean, it's all
meaningless anyway.

43:54.103 --> 43:56.737
This world
is going to crap.

43:56.771 --> 44:01.407
We're all
just directionless.

44:01.442 --> 44:06.444
Hiding behind
social media from each other.

44:06.478 --> 44:08.445
Simply just to be reassured

44:08.479 --> 44:11.547
that this all means anything.

44:11.581 --> 44:13.882
That we even exist.

44:13.916 --> 44:17.117
Or anybody even cares.

44:17.152 --> 44:20.887
Bridget, I didn't
know you felt that way.

44:20.921 --> 44:24.089
Yeah,
guess I feel a lot of ways.

44:24.123 --> 44:27.091
Just nobody can
ever see past my boobs.

44:27.125 --> 44:29.559
Long enough to listen I guess.

44:30.761 --> 44:34.163
Well, I listen.

44:35.764 --> 44:38.565
You are a good guy, Lester.

44:38.599 --> 44:42.067
Thank you, my mother
always said so.

44:42.102 --> 44:43.636
I'm still not having sex
with you, though.

44:46.272 --> 44:50.073
Yeah, thank you.
I'm painfully aware of that.

44:59.648 --> 45:02.215
Why do those people keep
coming to the water?

45:02.249 --> 45:04.716
They're setting up
a zombie shark buffet.

45:04.751 --> 45:07.585
Should, should we warn them?

45:26.132 --> 45:28.132
- Bridget: Get out of there!
- Lester: Get away from
the water.

45:28.166 --> 45:31.935
- Get away from
the water.
- Get out! come on!

45:46.979 --> 45:48.279
Bridget!

46:01.423 --> 46:07.159
Noooo!

46:08.594 --> 46:10.161
<i> As the strom
 continues to bombard the
 coastline</i>

46:10.195 --> 46:11.962
<i> while we're seeing
 a rather bizarre report</i>

46:11.996 --> 46:14.363
<i> from our affiliate station
 on Red Plum Island</i>

46:14.397 --> 46:16.031
<i> about a series 
 of shark attacks.</i>

46:16.066 --> 46:18.466
<i> Corresponding journalist
 Cat Ward is recovering</i>

46:18.500 --> 46:20.367
<i> from her own close
 call on the island.</i>

46:20.401 --> 46:22.135
<i> Captured here.</i>

46:22.170 --> 46:23.836
<i> And I warn you, this
 footage is shocking</i>

46:23.870 --> 46:25.871
<i> and may be difficult
 for some viewers.</i>

46:26.906 --> 46:30.541
( water splashing)

46:32.843 --> 46:34.811
Son of a...

46:36.779 --> 46:38.146
It's Sophie.

46:38.181 --> 46:39.647
Put her on speaker.

46:39.681 --> 46:42.015
Sophie, baby!

46:42.049 --> 46:44.718
<i> - Sophie: Mom are you there?
- Sophie I'm here!
Dad's here too.</i>

46:44.752 --> 46:46.619
<i> Sophie:
 Mom, you're breaking up!</i>

46:46.653 --> 46:49.320
We saw the news, some
kind of shark is attacking?

46:49.355 --> 46:52.055
Are you OK, baby?
How is your sister?

46:52.090 --> 46:53.624
<i> Sophie: Yeah, we're fine.</i>

46:53.658 --> 46:55.958
We tried calling
Jenner and --

46:55.993 --> 46:58.260
<i> Sophie: Jenner is dead, mom.</i>

47:00.595 --> 47:02.663
Hello?

47:02.697 --> 47:06.065
Hello, this is Red Plum Island
trying to reach the coastguard.

47:06.100 --> 47:07.599
Is anyone there?

47:13.037 --> 47:15.672
Mom, can you hear me?

47:15.706 --> 47:19.107
No, no, we're OK. I'm OK, Mom.

47:19.141 --> 47:20.541
Where is Amber?

47:20.576 --> 47:22.542
I wanna talk to her right now.

47:22.577 --> 47:26.612
<i> Sophie: Ugh, mom, this is
 not the time to argue.</i>

47:26.647 --> 47:29.714
<i> Look, Jenner had
 the keys to the boat.</i>

47:29.749 --> 47:31.949
<i> We're stuck here until we can
 radio the coastguard.</i>

47:31.983 --> 47:35.785
I'm not waiting on them.
I'm coming to get you, baby.

47:35.819 --> 47:37.719
<i> Sophie: Dad, no,
 don't, by the time you</i>

47:37.754 --> 47:39.488
<i> get here help will have
 already arrived.</i>

47:39.522 --> 47:42.723
<i> You'll just be putting
 yourself in danger too.</i>

47:42.758 --> 47:46.393
<i>- We'll be OK until
 the coastguard gets here.  
- Hey, Bill. It's Ross.</i>

47:46.427 --> 47:48.994
Sophie, listen, stay inside.

47:49.029 --> 47:52.030
Dad will find a way
to come and get you.
Stay where you are.

47:52.064 --> 47:54.364
<i> Sophie: Mom, don't!</i>

47:54.399 --> 47:58.200
I don't give a damn
how bad the storms are, Bill.
My girls are out there!

47:58.235 --> 48:01.903
<i> Sophie: Mom, really, we're
 fine, tell dad to stop.</i>

48:01.937 --> 48:04.938
<i> Don't worry about us. Amber
 is taking good care of me.</i>

48:04.973 --> 48:06.673
The storm is too heavy.

48:06.707 --> 48:10.275
Ain't nobody getting out
there until it lightens up.

48:10.310 --> 48:13.344
Amber had no business
dragging you off there.

48:13.378 --> 48:16.413
With the storm
and everything and now this?

48:16.447 --> 48:18.714
No, no, no, no,
it's not like that.

48:18.748 --> 48:23.084
Oh, my parents must
be worried sick right now.

48:24.519 --> 48:25.819
It took me
forever to convince

48:25.853 --> 48:28.788
them to let her
move to the city.

48:28.822 --> 48:31.723
And I promised I would
take care of her for them.

48:31.757 --> 48:35.326
They're not worried
about you too?

48:35.360 --> 48:36.693
No.

48:50.870 --> 48:54.571
This is my daughter, Marie.

49:01.610 --> 49:03.977
She's beautiful.

49:04.012 --> 49:08.247
It's the only picture I
have of her. She's 10 now.

49:08.282 --> 49:11.083
I had her when I was 15.

49:11.117 --> 49:14.051
Pretty wild back then.

49:14.086 --> 49:18.988
So I gave her up for
adoption and haven't
seen her since.

49:19.023 --> 49:20.622
I'm sorry.

49:20.657 --> 49:23.491
It's for the best, you know,

49:23.525 --> 49:27.894
and she has a great
life, so I hear.

49:27.929 --> 49:31.430
The truth is, though,

49:31.465 --> 49:35.499
Marie was the absolute last
straw with my parents.

49:35.533 --> 49:38.835
I was always
a disappointment for them.

49:38.869 --> 49:42.471
<i> Sophie: What? no,
 I can't hear you.</i>

49:42.505 --> 49:46.140
Sophie though, Sophie, I mean.

49:46.174 --> 49:47.941
Straight A's all
through high school.

49:47.975 --> 49:52.277
And she played basketball
and she volunteered at church.

49:52.312 --> 49:54.245
Jenner always said that...

49:59.649 --> 50:02.684
Do you have any family?

50:02.718 --> 50:06.186
Ex-wife, two kids,
a boy and a girl.

50:06.221 --> 50:09.922
I get to see them a lot more now
that I'm a private contractor.

50:09.957 --> 50:12.891
It takes a special kind

50:12.925 --> 50:15.526
to raise a family
in the service.

50:15.560 --> 50:18.027
And I was not that special.

50:18.062 --> 50:19.796
Barely got through.

50:21.364 --> 50:25.032
Sorry. What did mom say?

50:27.535 --> 50:29.870
She blames me for
this, doesn't she?

50:31.304 --> 50:33.038
How bad is it?

50:33.073 --> 50:35.306
Dad is trying to charter
a boat out here to come get us.

50:35.341 --> 50:39.176
But with the storm on
the mainland no one
would go out.

50:39.210 --> 50:41.911
I told them we're
OK but you know dad.

50:41.945 --> 50:44.579
I can meet you
there in 20 minutes.

50:47.215 --> 50:50.517
Oh come on, Charlie. I just
need to borrow your boat!

50:50.551 --> 50:53.419
I'll go by myself,
you don't even need to go.

50:55.087 --> 50:57.555
Damn it, Charlie!
I'm talking about my girls!

50:59.257 --> 51:01.624
( sighs )

51:06.929 --> 51:10.563
I turned off the TV,
I couldn't take it anymore.

51:13.299 --> 51:15.434
I blamed Amber.

51:19.904 --> 51:23.772
What if something
happens to Amber.

51:23.807 --> 51:27.442
And last thing she thinks

51:27.476 --> 51:29.743
is that I blamed her.

51:29.777 --> 51:32.211
It was so easy raising Sophie.

51:33.780 --> 51:37.816
She was always quiet

51:37.850 --> 51:40.417
and reflective.

51:40.452 --> 51:42.618
Never got upset about anything.

51:44.220 --> 51:48.022
Oh, but Amber,
she was defiant.

51:48.056 --> 51:51.624
And angry and always

51:51.659 --> 51:54.927
had to have the last word.

51:54.961 --> 51:58.095
- And she --
- She's just like you.

52:01.399 --> 52:04.266
That's why the two of
you can never get along.

52:04.301 --> 52:06.234
But she knows we love her.

52:06.268 --> 52:09.369
Oh, does she?

52:09.404 --> 52:11.971
We can tell her next
time we see her.

52:12.005 --> 52:15.574
- But what if --
- No, Davina.

52:15.608 --> 52:17.409
She's strong.

52:17.443 --> 52:19.009
She'll be all right.

52:20.345 --> 52:21.611
Have faith.

52:26.316 --> 52:27.882
I guess that's all we have.

52:44.061 --> 52:48.463
Hello. Hello. This is Red Plum
Island, can you hear me? Over.

52:50.966 --> 52:54.767
Hello, we're trying to
reach the coastguard,
can you hear me? Over.

52:54.802 --> 52:57.102
It's the storm,
even if you do get a signal

52:57.136 --> 53:01.404
out there, there's no way
they're gonna send a boat.

53:01.439 --> 53:04.007
We're just gonna have to
batten down and ride it out.

53:07.776 --> 53:10.044
Lester, are you OK?

53:11.279 --> 53:15.114
What did you do to those sharks?

53:15.148 --> 53:16.948
I'm not at the liberty
to talk about it.

53:16.983 --> 53:19.451
No matter how much I want to.

53:24.555 --> 53:28.190
You better start talking.
Right now.

53:28.224 --> 53:31.759
Lester, put the gun down.

53:31.793 --> 53:33.593
Not until
we get some answers.

53:33.628 --> 53:35.828
Look, do you even know how
to use that thing?

53:35.862 --> 53:37.930
Of course I do.

53:37.964 --> 53:40.999
I'm an apex predator.

53:41.033 --> 53:45.501
I'm a heartbreaker!
I'm a widow-maker!

53:47.337 --> 53:50.638
I just, just lost a friend.

53:59.145 --> 54:01.879
Listen, man, I'm no scientist.

54:01.914 --> 54:04.948
I was just brought
on for personal security.

54:04.982 --> 54:06.649
I do know the base
was closed down

54:06.683 --> 54:08.484
a long time ago
and recently reopened.

54:08.518 --> 54:11.819
A Dr. Diane Palmer was put
in charge of a special project

54:11.854 --> 54:13.687
that was contracted
by the government.

54:13.721 --> 54:17.356
A special killer
zombie shark project?

54:17.391 --> 54:21.059
No, that was an accident.

54:21.093 --> 54:25.962
Dr. Palmer was
trying to develop a way
of regenerating dead tissue.

54:25.996 --> 54:29.798
Organs, for soldiers
in the battlefield.

54:29.832 --> 54:32.033
Sharks were used as test
subjects because their basic

54:32.067 --> 54:35.302
internal structure is almost
identical to human beings.

54:35.336 --> 54:37.870
They're good analogs.

54:37.904 --> 54:41.172
They picked this island
because of the shark traffic.

54:41.206 --> 54:44.708
But something went wrong
with one of our sharks Bruce.

54:46.977 --> 54:51.947
He got out, he killed several of
the researchers and he escaped.

54:51.981 --> 54:55.348
Bruce, he is the one
with the harpoon on his back?

54:55.382 --> 54:56.916
The ringleader?

54:58.818 --> 55:02.219
Palmer put a beacon out in the
water that sent out a pulse that

55:02.254 --> 55:04.388
somehow it triggered
the electroreceptors

55:04.423 --> 55:06.990
in sharks and attracted them.

55:07.024 --> 55:09.858
Cage: That's how we brought them
in for capture and study.

55:09.893 --> 55:14.528
So can we use that to
capture it? to kill it?

55:14.562 --> 55:18.497
It was damaged in the firefight
when Bruce escaped.

55:18.532 --> 55:20.432
We have our tech Roger
working on in but until

55:20.466 --> 55:24.034
he gets it fixed, Bruce
is off his leash.

55:24.069 --> 55:26.736
And apparently he's
making more like him.

55:26.770 --> 55:28.738
Although they're not
as smart as him it seems.

55:28.772 --> 55:32.174
-  They're more like.
- Zombies.

55:33.642 --> 55:35.642
For a lack of a
better word, yeah.

55:35.676 --> 55:37.844
He is a carrier
of some kind of plague.

55:37.878 --> 55:40.813
Whatever he bites, it turns.

55:40.847 --> 55:45.215
Wait, whatever he bites?
Like people too?

55:45.249 --> 55:47.551
( growls )

55:47.585 --> 55:50.419
I said I've had about enough
of you!

55:50.454 --> 55:53.888
Come on, get out of here! go!
Shoo!

55:56.625 --> 55:59.559
- Freak.
- Who was that guy?

55:59.593 --> 56:01.827
Some idiot that
I need to get rid of.

56:01.861 --> 56:04.695
He always wants something free.

56:04.730 --> 56:06.230
Gives me the creeps.

56:20.273 --> 56:21.273
No!

56:26.578 --> 56:28.611
Sophie: How do we kill it?

56:28.646 --> 56:30.046
Clear!

56:37.685 --> 56:40.753
What? In all the zombie movies
do you have to ask?

56:40.787 --> 56:43.122
Palmer's regen agent,
it's activated by the nervous

56:43.156 --> 56:45.423
system you can cut off a limb,
but it still moves.

56:45.457 --> 56:47.024
Like the shark we
found on the beach.

56:47.058 --> 56:48.558
Makes sense
to take out the source.

56:48.593 --> 56:49.792
Aim for the brain.

56:49.826 --> 56:51.594
So what now?

56:51.628 --> 56:53.728
We destroy the infected and
keep the virus from spreading.

56:53.763 --> 56:56.430
That may not be enough,
we need to find a cure.

56:56.464 --> 56:58.132
Dr. Palmer is our only hope.

56:58.166 --> 56:59.899
We need to get back
to her right now.

56:59.933 --> 57:02.234
But if the islanders
are turning into zombies too,

57:02.268 --> 57:04.469
how are we gonna do that?
We need an army to fight
all of them.

57:04.504 --> 57:07.104
Leave it to me.
You get to the facility,

57:07.139 --> 57:09.305
I'll rally the troops,
we'll hold the infected
off here.

57:09.340 --> 57:10.607
Let's go.

57:19.847 --> 57:21.480
Yeah, it's me.

57:21.515 --> 57:24.249
It's time to awaken
the dogs of war.

57:24.283 --> 57:28.185
I mean get your weapons
and meet me over at the shop,
Danny.

57:28.219 --> 57:31.621
No, I don't have any gas money!
I just gave you money!

57:58.473 --> 58:01.474
( sighs )

58:09.114 --> 58:11.147
Oh, damn.

58:15.285 --> 58:17.885
Wasn't supposed to be like this.

58:19.353 --> 58:20.887
<i> Roger: Doctor!</i>

58:25.424 --> 58:28.792
<i> I think I got
 the beacon working.</i>

58:28.827 --> 58:31.928
That's the first good
news I've had all day.

58:31.962 --> 58:34.396
With it we can lure Bruce
and the other infected sharks

58:34.430 --> 58:36.431
back to the facility
for containment

58:36.466 --> 58:40.434
and immediate
extermination.

58:40.468 --> 58:45.204
And after we do that,
we're gonna start over
again, right?

58:47.506 --> 58:50.474
I don't know.

58:50.508 --> 58:53.409
I don't know if I have
the stomach for this anymore.

58:53.443 --> 58:57.312
This was supposed about saving
lives, not destroying them.

58:57.346 --> 59:00.047
I'm just more
concerned right now

59:00.081 --> 59:03.015
with trying to
clean up our mess.

59:06.085 --> 59:07.252
My mess.

59:10.422 --> 59:14.224
Diane, I need you
to listen to me.

59:14.258 --> 59:16.158
<i> You cannot
 give up on this work.</i>

59:16.192 --> 59:18.326
We are virtually
on the edge of giving

59:18.360 --> 59:20.961
the world something
truly phenomenal.

59:20.995 --> 59:24.130
We are about to cure
physical disabilities forever.

59:24.164 --> 59:26.398
And if you give up now,
you're gonna be giving up

59:26.433 --> 59:30.033
on every single
person on this Earth.

59:31.569 --> 59:35.538
Yes, we've had a pretty
significant setback.

59:35.572 --> 59:36.772
But we can do this.

59:38.241 --> 59:39.940
Roger!

59:39.975 --> 59:43.610
( screaming )

59:48.881 --> 59:51.249
( gasping )

01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:09.561
Lester:
OK, here's the score.

01:00:09.595 --> 01:00:12.830
We have a bit of a zombie shark
problem on the island.

01:00:12.864 --> 01:00:14.564
- What?
- Huh?

01:00:14.598 --> 01:00:17.499
Yeah, zombie shark.

01:00:17.534 --> 01:00:20.868
They bite you,
you turn into a zombie.

01:00:22.370 --> 01:00:24.004
Let this sink in a minute.

01:00:26.907 --> 01:00:31.875
Anyway, what we
do here on this beach...

01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:34.844
could shape all human history.

01:00:34.878 --> 01:00:38.513
This island has been
ignored for too long.

01:00:38.548 --> 01:00:40.081
But we will show the world that

01:00:40.116 --> 01:00:42.483
we are made of stronger stuff.

01:00:42.517 --> 01:00:44.851
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

01:00:44.885 --> 01:00:46.919
So get everything ready.

01:00:46.953 --> 01:00:49.987
Because what we
do on this beach today

01:00:50.022 --> 01:00:52.590
will bridge the gap
between all humanity.

01:00:54.192 --> 01:00:56.392
- Are you ready?
- Yeah!

01:00:59.228 --> 01:01:01.729
OK, here they come.

01:01:01.764 --> 01:01:06.432
Whatever you do,
don't let them bite you.

01:01:06.466 --> 01:01:11.136
Let them remember the time that
they came to Red Plum Island.

01:01:11.170 --> 01:01:15.271
- Come on!
- Yeah!

01:01:18.675 --> 01:01:21.375
Yeah! Let's get them!

01:01:21.410 --> 01:01:25.212
( growling )

01:01:57.068 --> 01:02:00.636
<i> Cage: Dr. Palmer, you read me?
 Over.</i>

01:02:00.670 --> 01:02:03.204
Sergeant, you're alive!

01:02:03.239 --> 01:02:05.572
Yeah, for now.

01:02:05.607 --> 01:02:09.242
We got a development, all
the shark's bite victims
are turning into zombies.

01:02:09.276 --> 01:02:12.110
Roger's fixed the beacon,
if we can activate it

01:02:12.144 --> 01:02:15.312
we can bring them all
right back to this facility.

01:02:15.347 --> 01:02:17.013
If we can get them
all in one place.

01:02:17.047 --> 01:02:19.349
Then we can kill
them all at once.

01:02:19.383 --> 01:02:22.717
I've got enough C-4 to do
the job. We're coming to you.

01:02:22.751 --> 01:02:24.418
Wait!

01:02:24.453 --> 01:02:27.287
Wait, I've been
working on a vaccine

01:02:27.321 --> 01:02:30.389
for the virus,
but in order to finalize it.

01:02:30.423 --> 01:02:34.392
I need to test it on
one of the infected.

01:02:34.426 --> 01:02:39.362
I need an infected brain.
Intact.

01:02:39.396 --> 01:02:41.463
Doctor, I don't
think that that's
a good idea you haven't seen

01:02:41.497 --> 01:02:44.431
what this things can do,
they don't exactly stay still
for you.

01:02:45.834 --> 01:02:47.300
One of them does.

01:03:03.545 --> 01:03:04.779
Oh!

01:03:06.681 --> 01:03:10.116
Come on! come on!
I'm ready for you!

01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:19.155
Come on! We'll have
a fish sandwich.

01:03:19.189 --> 01:03:24.092
Oh! He's strong!
Wait, okay, I got him, yeah!

01:03:24.127 --> 01:03:26.961
Yeah!

01:03:29.597 --> 01:03:32.932
( shouting )

01:03:32.966 --> 01:03:34.799
Hey! Hey!
Watch out, watch out!

01:03:38.136 --> 01:03:42.104
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
Oh, my God he took
his arm away! I'm sorry!

01:03:42.139 --> 01:03:43.371
( screams )

01:03:55.414 --> 01:03:59.950
No, no, no, wait,
it was right here.

01:03:59.984 --> 01:04:02.418
Fan out, we got to
find this thing.

01:04:18.163 --> 01:04:20.530
Amber:
Sophie, don't get too far!

01:04:20.564 --> 01:04:22.831
Relax, warden.

01:05:03.860 --> 01:05:06.260
Guys, I found it!

01:05:06.295 --> 01:05:08.162
Amber: Soph, where are you?

01:05:08.197 --> 01:05:11.665
Sophie: I'm on the other
side of the grass.

01:05:11.699 --> 01:05:15.867
( grunting )

01:05:30.745 --> 01:05:32.412
Okay, get back!
Get back!

01:05:32.446 --> 01:05:35.047
How are we going to carry it
to the facility?

01:05:37.850 --> 01:05:39.250
Get that coat.

01:05:42.754 --> 01:05:43.953
Ew!

01:05:47.857 --> 01:05:49.090
Stay back!

01:05:54.361 --> 01:05:55.360
Okay!

01:05:57.230 --> 01:05:58.863
We need to get to Palmer.

01:06:07.636 --> 01:06:09.437
Hold on.

01:06:09.471 --> 01:06:11.571
What is it?

01:06:11.606 --> 01:06:13.240
Hold this.

01:06:13.274 --> 01:06:14.440
Careful.

01:06:16.643 --> 01:06:18.109
Something's not right.

01:06:19.278 --> 01:06:22.513
I don't see anything.

01:06:22.547 --> 01:06:26.348
Things are too quiet.
Feels like we're walking
into an ambush.

01:06:26.382 --> 01:06:29.884
What, do you think they're
hiding? Are they smart
enough for that?

01:06:32.386 --> 01:06:34.521
I don't know. Bruce could be.

01:06:34.555 --> 01:06:35.888
They're here!

01:06:38.724 --> 01:06:39.924
Here!

01:06:45.929 --> 01:06:47.263
Watch out!

01:07:05.509 --> 01:07:07.576
Argh! Argh!

01:07:07.610 --> 01:07:08.610
( gasps )

01:07:11.980 --> 01:07:14.214
- Argh!
- Hold on, you'll be OK.

01:07:20.553 --> 01:07:21.852
( zombie grunts )

01:07:21.886 --> 01:07:23.287
I got it!

01:07:26.156 --> 01:07:28.090
( zombie grunts )

01:07:35.930 --> 01:07:37.896
Let's go! Get the guns!
Let's go!

01:07:39.065 --> 01:07:40.264
Come on!

01:07:48.672 --> 01:07:49.804
Sergeant Cage!

01:07:49.839 --> 01:07:50.972
He was stabbed.

01:07:51.006 --> 01:07:53.340
Thank God he wasn't bitten!

01:08:01.047 --> 01:08:02.646
( Max grunts )

01:08:02.681 --> 01:08:06.850
It looks like it missed
any major arteries.

01:08:06.884 --> 01:08:08.250
I can stitch these up for you.

01:08:08.284 --> 01:08:09.818
Not right now,
we don't have the time.

01:08:09.853 --> 01:08:11.319
Sophie! Can you help me out.

01:08:11.353 --> 01:08:12.420
Is that--

01:08:12.454 --> 01:08:13.821
We got you a gift, doctor.

01:08:16.290 --> 01:08:18.823
I can't believe you managed
to get one.

01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:21.826
Just tell us it was worth it.

01:08:21.861 --> 01:08:24.161
That's what were are going
to find out.

01:08:27.464 --> 01:08:28.831
Careful, it bites.

01:08:32.667 --> 01:08:34.001
Incredible.

01:08:35.703 --> 01:08:37.537
The regen agent worked.

01:08:37.571 --> 01:08:39.404
Yeah, really well.

01:08:41.508 --> 01:08:43.407
You must be Amber Steel.

01:08:43.442 --> 01:08:45.841
I'm Dr. Diane Palmer
from the radio.

01:08:47.745 --> 01:08:50.345
I... I'm so sorry.

01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:52.479
For all of this.

01:08:52.515 --> 01:08:56.350
Well, let's just figure out
a way to fix it.

01:08:56.384 --> 01:09:00.685
Bruce escaped before we
had a chance to study
his condition.

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:04.087
It appears as though once
the virus takes hold,

01:09:04.122 --> 01:09:06.823
the host is reanimated
by an electrical response

01:09:06.857 --> 01:09:09.691
in the nervous system.

01:09:09.725 --> 01:09:12.960
Like when you take a dead frog

01:09:12.995 --> 01:09:15.129
and attach it to a battery
and it twitches.

01:09:15.163 --> 01:09:18.064
The dead tissue
is rebuilt to some extent.

01:09:18.099 --> 01:09:20.032
But based on your descriptions,

01:09:20.066 --> 01:09:23.401
the reanimated have
no thought processes

01:09:23.435 --> 01:09:26.069
besides the simple instincts to

01:09:26.104 --> 01:09:30.206
move, eat and make more
of its own.

01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:32.908
It's not much different
than a regular shark, really.

01:09:32.942 --> 01:09:35.776
No, Bruce is different.
He's smarter than the others.

01:09:35.810 --> 01:09:37.577
He seems to be planning.

01:09:37.611 --> 01:09:39.444
Well, he is the alpha.

01:09:39.479 --> 01:09:42.447
He's the only one that
was directly injected.

01:09:42.482 --> 01:09:45.616
But without him here to study
there's really no way to know

01:09:45.651 --> 01:09:49.852
why Bruce reacted
to the regen agent
the way he did.

01:09:49.886 --> 01:09:51.953
Have you found
a cure yet?

01:09:51.988 --> 01:09:53.555
That's what we are
about to test.

01:09:58.159 --> 01:09:59.525
Where's Roger?

01:10:05.664 --> 01:10:09.132
I've been able to develop
a rudimentary vaccine

01:10:09.166 --> 01:10:11.234
against the initial serum.

01:10:11.267 --> 01:10:13.135
Once injected
into the bloodstream

01:10:13.169 --> 01:10:16.704
of a healthy subject,
it should be able to neutralize

01:10:16.738 --> 01:10:19.940
the effects of the serum before
the infection ever takes root.

01:10:19.974 --> 01:10:22.441
Though we do have a lot
of tests to run.

01:10:22.475 --> 01:10:26.110
This may be our only opportunity
to gather data

01:10:26.145 --> 01:10:29.346
without running the risk
of creating another Bruce.

01:10:30.981 --> 01:10:33.181
Could you secure the patient?

01:10:36.484 --> 01:10:40.320
A shark's brain is smaller
than a human's.

01:10:40.354 --> 01:10:42.654
It's much more difficult
to find.

01:10:44.157 --> 01:10:46.457
Got to get in there
and penetrate without...

01:10:47.993 --> 01:10:49.993
damaging it.

01:10:51.162 --> 01:10:52.161
There!

01:10:55.664 --> 01:10:56.698
Did it work?

01:11:05.671 --> 01:11:07.037
No.

01:11:08.873 --> 01:11:11.341
So, what does that mean?

01:11:11.375 --> 01:11:13.642
It means that it only works
on the living.

01:11:15.612 --> 01:11:18.913
The infected are already
too far gone.

01:11:18.947 --> 01:11:21.314
But there's got to be a way.

01:11:21.349 --> 01:11:23.782
What about those people
that got bit on the island?

01:11:23.817 --> 01:11:25.450
You're saying there's no hope
for them?

01:11:26.852 --> 01:11:29.152
I'm sorry.

01:11:29.187 --> 01:11:31.321
If we had more time, but...

01:11:31.356 --> 01:11:33.022
No, this much will have to do.

01:11:33.056 --> 01:11:34.990
Cage: She's right.

01:11:35.024 --> 01:11:37.825
We've got to stop the virus
before it gets off the island.

01:11:37.859 --> 01:11:40.327
That's our priority.
We must stick to the plan.

01:11:40.362 --> 01:11:43.663
Activate the beacon, bring in
the sharks

01:11:43.697 --> 01:11:46.198
and blow this place
to hell and back,

01:11:47.366 --> 01:11:50.200
( screaming )

01:11:56.372 --> 01:11:57.572
( screams )

01:12:02.743 --> 01:12:05.111
( whirring )

01:12:13.317 --> 01:12:15.183
Here goes nothing.

01:12:20.821 --> 01:12:22.055
( sighs )

01:12:22.089 --> 01:12:23.323
It's on.

01:12:25.659 --> 01:12:27.492
Way to go, Roger.

01:12:32.797 --> 01:12:34.597
( pants )

01:12:34.631 --> 01:12:36.032
Stay down!

01:12:46.205 --> 01:12:47.406
Look!

01:12:53.244 --> 01:12:54.743
They're... they're leaving!

01:12:56.112 --> 01:12:58.079
Hey, they're leaving!

01:12:58.113 --> 01:12:59.280
( laughing )

01:12:59.315 --> 01:13:01.081
And don't come back!

01:13:04.618 --> 01:13:08.086
Wait...
Where are you all going?

01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:10.287
Oh, man! They're going
to the facility!

01:13:11.589 --> 01:13:14.557
C-4's been planted.
Ready to go.

01:13:19.561 --> 01:13:20.561
Ahm...

01:13:21.596 --> 01:13:22.595
Sergeant--

01:13:22.630 --> 01:13:23.630
Call me Max.

01:13:24.666 --> 01:13:26.332
Max.

01:13:26.866 --> 01:13:29.000
I never got a chance
to thank you for everything

01:13:29.034 --> 01:13:31.469
you've done for Sophie and me.

01:13:32.104 --> 01:13:33.604
I just...

01:13:35.506 --> 01:13:37.085
If anything goes wrong,

01:13:37.974 --> 01:13:39.708
could you just...

01:13:39.742 --> 01:13:42.510
make sure Sophie gets home okay?

01:13:42.544 --> 01:13:43.837
You have my word.

01:13:44.679 --> 01:13:48.090
But I'm not planning on letting
anything happen to you either.

01:14:05.459 --> 01:14:07.360
Sophie: What is that?

01:14:07.794 --> 01:14:10.128
It's my brother, Ethan.

01:14:15.132 --> 01:14:18.266
He was a lot like
Sergeant Cage.

01:14:18.301 --> 01:14:20.902
Always the first one
into the hot zone.

01:14:20.937 --> 01:14:22.770
He was very brave.

01:14:24.972 --> 01:14:27.973
And he loved this country.

01:14:28.007 --> 01:14:31.542
He died for this country.

01:14:31.577 --> 01:14:35.212
He died on foreign soil
of a wound that was

01:14:35.246 --> 01:14:37.813
easily treatable.

01:14:37.848 --> 01:14:40.248
His unit was too far away
from the hospital

01:14:40.282 --> 01:14:42.250
and first aid
wasn't adequate.

01:14:42.284 --> 01:14:43.684
And...

01:14:47.855 --> 01:14:51.323
He died and there wasn't
anything I could do about it.

01:14:54.493 --> 01:14:56.259
( sighs )

01:14:56.293 --> 01:15:00.329
I decided then that I was never
gonna be that helpless again.

01:15:01.964 --> 01:15:04.364
That's why I developed
the regen agent.

01:15:04.399 --> 01:15:08.167
To give soldiers like Ethan
more endurance

01:15:08.201 --> 01:15:10.602
and better healing capabilities,
you know?

01:15:10.636 --> 01:15:12.570
To give them another chance.

01:15:15.073 --> 01:15:19.108
But I... never thought this...

01:15:19.143 --> 01:15:20.809
I can make it right.

01:15:23.211 --> 01:15:26.112
I will make it right.

01:15:32.284 --> 01:15:33.551
It's working.

01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:37.554
They're coming.

01:15:41.891 --> 01:15:43.024
Oh, they're inside.

01:15:43.058 --> 01:15:45.426
- Inside?
- Yeah.

01:15:45.460 --> 01:15:46.960
There's a pool down below that
has a gate that leads out
to the ocean.

01:15:46.995 --> 01:15:49.362
Yeah, that's how we bring
the sharks in.

01:15:49.396 --> 01:15:51.897
That's how Bruce got out
after he killed almost all
of my team.

01:15:51.931 --> 01:15:53.165
Let's go. Come on.

01:16:04.506 --> 01:16:05.740
Wait!

01:16:07.942 --> 01:16:10.309
The vaccine's still inside.

01:16:10.343 --> 01:16:12.177
If this doesn't work
that vaccination

01:16:12.211 --> 01:16:15.279
is the last hope any of us have.

01:16:15.313 --> 01:16:17.281
I'll be right back.

01:16:19.850 --> 01:16:20.950
I'm coming with you!

01:16:20.984 --> 01:16:21.983
Sophie, wait!

01:16:22.018 --> 01:16:23.118
Get to the shore!

01:16:23.152 --> 01:16:24.618
Let her go.

01:16:27.155 --> 01:16:30.689
I don't know if you noticed,
but your sister is
kind of a badass.

01:16:32.025 --> 01:16:33.425
Yeah, she is.

01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:35.760
Okay.

01:16:38.863 --> 01:16:40.196
Where is it?

01:16:51.238 --> 01:16:53.004
Got it.

01:16:53.039 --> 01:16:56.207
( screams )

01:16:59.610 --> 01:17:00.577
Take it!

01:17:00.611 --> 01:17:01.677
- But...
- I'm bit.

01:17:01.711 --> 01:17:04.079
Just go!

01:17:04.113 --> 01:17:06.180
Go!

01:17:06.215 --> 01:17:07.215
I'm sorry.

01:17:07.249 --> 01:17:08.715
Go!

01:17:22.259 --> 01:17:24.159
I need to blow it
before they get out.

01:17:51.612 --> 01:17:54.246
Sophie! Sophie, hurry!

01:17:57.315 --> 01:17:58.282
Do it!

01:17:58.316 --> 01:17:59.283
Max: Three...

01:17:59.317 --> 01:18:01.551
two... one!

01:18:12.559 --> 01:18:14.560
Sophie!

01:18:35.775 --> 01:18:36.775
Sophie...

01:18:37.976 --> 01:18:40.544
It wasn't supposed to be you!

01:18:50.351 --> 01:18:53.319
Amber, it's Bruce.

01:18:59.891 --> 01:19:01.659
He must...

01:19:01.693 --> 01:19:03.993
He must have let the others go
in first to test it out.

01:19:04.028 --> 01:19:05.861
I told you he was smart.

01:19:16.269 --> 01:19:17.502
Amber!

01:19:19.872 --> 01:19:22.839
Come on! Come on!

01:19:22.874 --> 01:19:24.206
Amber, stop it!

01:19:24.241 --> 01:19:26.441
Come on, if you want me,
come on!

01:19:27.777 --> 01:19:31.512
Come on! Come on!

01:19:34.214 --> 01:19:35.781
Amber, stop!

01:19:45.755 --> 01:19:48.122
Amber, get out of the way!
I got a shot!

01:19:55.262 --> 01:19:57.462
( panting )

01:20:18.211 --> 01:20:19.444
Amber, move!

01:20:20.746 --> 01:20:21.779
( cries )

01:20:24.415 --> 01:20:25.615
Max: Watch out!

01:20:27.050 --> 01:20:29.417
( screaming )

01:20:48.131 --> 01:20:49.797
Amber!

01:21:02.307 --> 01:21:03.741
Don't miss!

01:21:35.296 --> 01:21:36.863
( panting )

01:21:55.410 --> 01:21:56.710
Is he dead?

01:21:58.211 --> 01:21:59.812
He better be.

01:22:01.047 --> 01:22:02.180
Sophie?

01:22:05.950 --> 01:22:07.517
Sorry about Sophie.

01:22:13.622 --> 01:22:15.256
( moaning )

01:22:15.290 --> 01:22:18.124
Sophie? Sophie!

01:22:18.159 --> 01:22:19.458
Sophie!

01:22:19.492 --> 01:22:21.627
Give me something
to cut her out!

01:22:23.062 --> 01:22:24.462
( moaning )

01:22:30.133 --> 01:22:31.466
( Amber grunts )

01:22:32.535 --> 01:22:33.835
( Amber pants )

01:22:37.205 --> 01:22:39.672
Sophie! Sophie!

01:22:43.342 --> 01:22:46.677
( gasping )

01:22:48.012 --> 01:22:49.012
Lester: Sophie?

01:22:50.046 --> 01:22:51.246
Amber!

01:22:55.451 --> 01:22:57.617
( Sophie grunts )

01:23:28.206 --> 01:23:29.172
Let's go.

01:23:29.207 --> 01:23:30.940
( Amber cries )

01:23:48.053 --> 01:23:49.686
What's that?

01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:52.387
Is the vaccine that's
going to save humankind.

01:23:52.422 --> 01:23:55.690
I need to get it into
the right hands as soon
as possible.

01:24:01.762 --> 01:24:02.762
Come on.

01:24:04.897 --> 01:24:05.897
Let's go.

01:24:05.931 --> 01:24:07.498
Come on.

01:24:10.001 --> 01:24:11.200
It's over.

01:24:17.839 --> 01:24:19.873
The coast guard should
be here soon.
