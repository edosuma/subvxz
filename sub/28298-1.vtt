03:06.978 --> 03:08.094
Anyone here?

03:16.279 --> 03:17.986
My name is Erwin Griswold.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.364
I am the dean
of this place.

03:21.284 --> 03:23.571
Welcome to Harvard Law School.

03:25.247 --> 03:27.239
Take a moment
to look around you.

03:27.791 --> 03:32.001
In this room, there are Rhodes
and Fulbright scholars,

03:32.087 --> 03:33.703
Phi Beta Kappa members,

03:33.797 --> 03:35.754
student body presidents,

03:35.841 --> 03:38.083
and a Harvard football
team captain.

03:39.845 --> 03:40.845
Together,

03:41.847 --> 03:44.009
you will become lawyers.

03:44.850 --> 03:47.217
This is a privilege
you share.

03:48.186 --> 03:52.351
It is also a responsibility
you accept.

03:54.776 --> 03:55.776
Consider.

03:56.987 --> 04:00.480
What does it mean
to be a Harvard man?

04:01.992 --> 04:05.076
A Harvard man is intelligent,
of course,

04:05.162 --> 04:07.905
but he is also tenacious.

04:07.998 --> 04:11.833
He is a leader devoted
to the rule of law.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.665
He is mindful of his country

04:14.755 --> 04:16.747
loyal to tradition,

04:16.839 --> 04:22.052
and he is respectful
and protective of our institutions.

04:26.850 --> 04:30.434
...shall be computed as of subsection A
of this section applied...

04:30.520 --> 04:32.978
Which one makes me
look more like a Harvard man?

04:36.902 --> 04:40.066
I'm thrilled to report that you look
nothing like a Harvard man.

04:40.155 --> 04:41.755
Seriously?
It's the dean's dinner, Marty.

04:41.782 --> 04:44.343
You know how I am at these things.
I need to make a good impression.

04:44.367 --> 04:47.781
And you will, Kiki. But you've got it wrong.
It's not the dress, it's you.

04:49.206 --> 04:51.368
You haven't touched
your tuna casserole.

04:52.417 --> 04:53.828
Come here, sweetie.

04:53.919 --> 04:55.785
Come on. Here we go.

04:57.172 --> 04:58.879
I've put onions in.
They help, right?

04:59.382 --> 05:00.382
Definitely.

05:02.636 --> 05:04.298
I don't like
either of these.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.642
Okay. Where were we?

05:19.528 --> 05:20.528
Thank you.

05:37.879 --> 05:41.714
Ladies and gentlemen, please join us
in the dining room as dinner is served.

05:41.800 --> 05:44.588
And professors,
please escort the ladies in.

05:46.638 --> 05:47.638
May I?

06:04.030 --> 06:06.613
He said, "Professor,
have you corrected our papers?"

06:06.700 --> 06:08.942
And I said, "Correcting them
will take a lifetime.

06:09.035 --> 06:10.151
"I'm merely grading them."

06:14.457 --> 06:16.494
Esteemed colleagues, ladies,

06:17.377 --> 06:20.211
this is only the sixth year
women have had

06:20.297 --> 06:22.789
the privilege to earn
a Harvard law degree.

06:22.883 --> 06:26.376
This little soiree
is our way of saying welcome.

06:26.469 --> 06:28.677
My wife Harriet and I

06:28.763 --> 06:32.302
are very glad all nine
of you have joined us.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.179
Let us go around the table,

06:38.273 --> 06:42.483
and each of you ladies report
who you are, where you're from

06:42.569 --> 06:47.610
and why you're occupying a place at
Harvard that could have gone to a man.

06:53.038 --> 06:54.119
Yeah.

06:54.205 --> 06:55.205
Well...

06:55.957 --> 06:57.573
Why don't you
get us started, dear?

07:01.546 --> 07:04.914
I'm Hennie Callaghan.
Father's a lawyer back in Minneapolis.

07:05.008 --> 07:07.796
He used to give me drafts of
contracts to use for drawing paper,

07:07.886 --> 07:10.173
but at some point,
I got more interested

07:10.263 --> 07:11.925
in reading them
than drawing on them.

07:13.183 --> 07:17.177
In a few years, it's gonna be
Callaghan and Callaghan.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.852
That was fine.

07:20.065 --> 07:21.065
Next.

07:24.486 --> 07:26.523
Emily Hicks. Hello.

07:26.613 --> 07:27.613
Connecticut.

07:27.697 --> 07:30.986
When I finished Mount Holyoke,
my mother wanted me to get married.

07:31.618 --> 07:32.734
But I didn't wanna do that.

07:32.827 --> 07:35.365
And I didn't wanna be
a teacher or a nurse.

07:35.455 --> 07:36.571
- So...
- Ah!

07:37.332 --> 07:39.289
That's not
a very good reason.

07:40.502 --> 07:41.502
Next.

07:46.299 --> 07:47.415
Oh.

07:47.509 --> 07:49.171
- Watch it.
- Sorry.

07:56.393 --> 07:57.393
Uh...

07:57.894 --> 08:01.979
I'm Ruth Ginsburg
from Brooklyn.

08:04.067 --> 08:05.979
And why are you here,
Miss Ginsburg?

08:06.569 --> 08:09.562
Uh, Mrs. Ginsburg, actually.

08:10.407 --> 08:12.615
My husband Marty
is in the second-year class.

08:14.244 --> 08:17.032
I'm at Harvard to learn
more about his work,

08:17.122 --> 08:20.160
so I can be a more patient
and understanding wife.

08:25.005 --> 08:29.124
Come to dinner. The beans will be boiled,
the chicken will be stewed

08:29.217 --> 08:30.549
and you will be grilled.

08:30.635 --> 08:33.342
We came to Harvard
to be lawyers. Why else?

08:33.429 --> 08:34.671
It's truly
an asinine question.

08:34.764 --> 08:36.255
He's never gonna
take me seriously.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.841
No, that's not true.
You're the smartest person here.

08:38.934 --> 08:40.597
And you're gonna be
the most prepared.

08:40.687 --> 08:42.303
So just stand up
and say what you know.

08:42.397 --> 08:44.041
At a place like this,
that's all that matters.

08:44.065 --> 08:48.105
In my experience, even small mistakes
are glaring when you stick out.

08:49.487 --> 08:51.604
Well, then you're very lucky.

08:53.450 --> 08:54.450
Because you

08:56.828 --> 08:59.195
are very short.

09:11.134 --> 09:12.134
Oh, yeah?

09:18.349 --> 09:19.385
Yeah.

09:21.478 --> 09:27.725
Well, why don't you come down
here and say that to my face?

09:53.051 --> 09:54.758
Mrs. Ginsburg.

09:54.844 --> 09:55.844
Hmm.

10:12.904 --> 10:17.740
I am Professor Brown.
This is Introduction to Contracts.

10:17.992 --> 10:20.200
<i>Hawkins v. McGee.</i>

10:21.329 --> 10:23.787
State the case, please.

10:33.508 --> 10:34.508
Mr. Pruitt.

10:37.053 --> 10:39.716
Uh, good morning. I'm Donald Pruitt.
I'm really honored to be here.

10:39.806 --> 10:41.297
<i>Hawkins v. McGee.</i>

10:41.391 --> 10:42.882
Uh, yeah,
<i>Hawkins v. McGee,</i>

10:42.976 --> 10:45.764
it's a fascinating breach
of contract case where...

10:46.896 --> 10:48.888
Charles Hawkins hurt
his hand and McGee...

10:48.982 --> 10:50.564
Can someone help him please?

10:59.450 --> 11:00.782
Mr. Fitzpatrick.

11:03.413 --> 11:06.121
It was Charles' son who hurt his hand.
Electrocution burn.

11:06.207 --> 11:08.870
And at what point does the case turn,
Mr. Fitzpatrick?

11:09.627 --> 11:12.995
McGee promised to fix the hand
by performing a skin graft.

11:13.089 --> 11:15.126
But McGee wasn't very familiar
with the procedure

11:15.216 --> 11:17.208
and the results weren't
quite what he planned.

11:20.263 --> 11:23.552
Question already?
Mrs. Ginsburg.

11:23.641 --> 11:24.927
Correction, Professor Brown.

11:25.018 --> 11:28.261
McGee did not simply promise
to fix George Hawkins' hand,

11:28.354 --> 11:29.686
he promised, quote,

11:30.398 --> 11:32.481
"a 100% good hand."

11:32.567 --> 11:33.728
That's the same thing.

11:33.818 --> 11:34.818
Is it?

11:35.153 --> 11:36.735
What say you, Mrs. Ginsburg?

11:36.905 --> 11:37.986
It is not.

11:38.740 --> 11:40.026
Words matter.

11:40.658 --> 11:43.150
McGee grafted skin
from Hawkins' chest.

11:43.244 --> 11:45.236
Not only did this fail
to fix the scarring,

11:45.330 --> 11:47.367
he had chest hair
growing on his palm.

11:47.457 --> 11:49.824
Proving that a hand
with a burn is worth two with a bush.

11:52.962 --> 11:54.749
The court denied
Hawkins damages.

11:54.839 --> 11:56.150
Hawkins did get damages.
The court said...

11:56.174 --> 11:57.506
If I may finish?

11:58.843 --> 12:01.836
Hawkins was denied damages
for pain and suffering.

12:02.096 --> 12:05.089
The New Hampshire Supreme Court
ruled he was entitled to damages

12:05.183 --> 12:07.891
only based on the contract
being fulfilled.

12:09.812 --> 12:12.179
So if Dr. McGee had set
realistic expectations

12:12.273 --> 12:14.014
instead of making
grand promises,

12:14.108 --> 12:16.350
Hawkins' award
likely would have been less.

12:20.657 --> 12:23.946
Was that an answer,
Mrs. Ginsburg, or a filibuster?

12:30.041 --> 12:31.041
Hmm.

12:36.422 --> 12:37.503
Movie.

12:38.007 --> 12:39.007
Four words.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.171
- Second word.
- Seven?

12:41.261 --> 12:42.297
- Seven.
- Uh-oh.

12:42.387 --> 12:43.387
Fourth word.

12:45.390 --> 12:46.756
- Monkey.
- Oh, gorilla.

12:46.849 --> 12:48.340
Monkey business! Ape!

12:48.434 --> 12:50.300
- Monkey, monkey.
- Ape!

12:51.354 --> 12:52.936
Monkey on my back?

12:55.358 --> 12:56.769
Second word, "seven."

12:56.859 --> 12:58.816
- Seven...
<i>- Seven Brides for Seven Brothers?</i>

12:58.903 --> 13:00.863
- What does that have to do with monkeys?
- And...

13:00.947 --> 13:02.813
- Oh, oh! <i>The Seven Year Itch.</i>
- Time!

13:02.907 --> 13:04.739
Oh! Oh!

13:07.370 --> 13:09.532
Ruthless Ruthy
strikes again.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.534
Okay. Next round's
riding on you.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.491
Don't worry,
he's very good.

13:13.584 --> 13:15.604
Thank God, because she
actually broke up with someone

13:15.628 --> 13:16.668
for being bad at Charades.

13:16.713 --> 13:19.626
- You didn't really?
- It was a manifestation

13:19.716 --> 13:20.877
of his being an idiot.

13:20.967 --> 13:22.048
See?

13:22.135 --> 13:23.862
Don't worry, I'm comfortable
being smarter than you.

13:23.886 --> 13:24.886
Oh, thank you.

13:24.971 --> 13:26.291
All right, everybody ready?

13:27.098 --> 13:28.305
Uh, song.

13:30.560 --> 13:32.426
- Buddy Holly?
- Bill Haley.

13:32.854 --> 13:33.890
By Elvis.

13:34.689 --> 13:35.896
Three words.

13:36.274 --> 13:37.714
- First word.
- First word.

13:38.401 --> 13:39.437
Uh...

13:39.527 --> 13:41.063
- Uh, table.
- A glass?

13:41.154 --> 13:42.235
A book.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.154
- Reading!
- Uh, blue!

13:44.240 --> 13:46.698
- Uh, <i>Blueberry Hill.</i>
- No, that's Fats Domino.

13:46.784 --> 13:47.991
- Third word.
- Third word.

13:48.077 --> 13:49.193
- Floor.
- Carpet.

13:49.287 --> 13:51.279
- Dancing?
- Nice moves.

13:53.082 --> 13:54.414
Oh, no sound effects.

13:54.959 --> 13:56.166
Oh, <i>Blue Suede Shoes!</i>

13:56.252 --> 13:58.209
Come on, Marty,
you're a lightweight.

13:58.296 --> 13:59.832
Marty?

13:59.922 --> 14:01.914
Marty?

14:02.008 --> 14:03.749
- Help! Help!
- Is he all right?

14:03.843 --> 14:04.924
Someone get some help!

14:13.061 --> 14:14.597
The doctor's ready
to see you.

14:45.051 --> 14:46.212
Excuse me.

14:46.677 --> 14:47.838
Just a moment please.

14:51.682 --> 14:54.140
- Excuse me, I just...
- Just a moment, I need to make a call.

14:56.354 --> 14:59.062
Yes. Can we have
the results today?

14:59.399 --> 15:00.685
Excuse me?

15:01.234 --> 15:04.102
Doctor. You examined
my husband.

15:04.195 --> 15:06.215
I'm wondering when you think
he'll be able to leave.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.777
- I need to call the sitter...
- What's the patient's name?

15:09.575 --> 15:11.441
Martin Ginsburg.

15:11.536 --> 15:13.323
Right. Ginsburg.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.575
Hmm.

15:15.665 --> 15:16.906
Yeah, he's not
going home today.

15:16.999 --> 15:19.241
- Excuse me?
- We have more tests to run.

15:21.379 --> 15:22.460
What kind of tests?

15:22.547 --> 15:24.191
Various kinds.
He's gonna be with us a while.

15:24.215 --> 15:25.922
What tests?
I need to see him.

15:26.008 --> 15:29.968
Go home, get some rest.
We'll know more in a few days.

15:30.054 --> 15:31.465
Now, if you'll excuse me.

15:36.686 --> 15:37.686
<i>How is he?</i>

15:39.021 --> 15:40.137
Fine.

15:50.032 --> 15:51.739
Call any time, okay?

15:56.122 --> 15:57.158
Bye.

16:48.758 --> 16:50.590
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:57.058 --> 16:59.345
At least you got
a break from my cooking.

17:04.397 --> 17:05.638
Afternoon.

17:05.733 --> 17:07.690
- Hey, Doc.
- Dr. Leadbetter.

17:11.656 --> 17:12.692
It's as we feared.

17:14.742 --> 17:17.108
Marty, you're young,
and we caught it early.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.404
We've pioneered
a new treatment here.

17:20.498 --> 17:25.084
It entails numerous surgeries,
each followed by a course of radiation.

17:25.586 --> 17:29.045
There's a chance you can go on
to a healthy, happy life.

17:29.131 --> 17:30.497
As if none of this
had happened.

17:30.591 --> 17:33.379
Well, what kind of a chance?

17:34.053 --> 17:36.545
Dr. Leadbetter, we'd rather
know what we're facing.

17:39.392 --> 17:42.601
Survival rate for testicular
cancer has been about 5%.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.351
Thanks for the honesty.

17:48.442 --> 17:49.442
I think.

17:49.527 --> 17:50.893
I'll let you two talk.

18:31.986 --> 18:33.397
We're never giving up.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.321
You keep working.

18:38.242 --> 18:39.449
Keep studying.

18:40.077 --> 18:41.909
Jane will have her father.

18:43.748 --> 18:45.239
You will be a lawyer.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.873
I'm spending my life with you,
Martin Ginsburg.

19:13.736 --> 19:15.693
<i>Judicial consistency.</i>

19:16.280 --> 19:21.241
<i>The doctrine of stare decisis
comes from English common law,</i>

19:21.327 --> 19:23.785
which also provides
the first examples

19:23.871 --> 19:27.285
of circumstances where
precedence may be overturned.

19:27.375 --> 19:28.491
Excuse me.

19:29.293 --> 19:31.660
- Judges are bound...
- Thank you.

19:31.754 --> 19:32.961
Excuse me.

19:33.047 --> 19:34.583
May I help you?

19:34.924 --> 19:38.042
Um...
I'm Martin Ginsburg's wife.

19:38.135 --> 19:40.718
I'll be attending
his classes for him.

19:41.764 --> 19:43.471
In addition to your own?

19:44.141 --> 19:46.849
Yes, Professor Freund.

19:53.109 --> 19:57.149
Judges are bound
by precedence,

19:57.238 --> 19:59.400
but they cannot ignore
cultural change.

20:00.241 --> 20:03.780
A court ought not be affected
by the weather of the day,

20:03.869 --> 20:06.987
but will be by
the climate of the era.

20:10.042 --> 20:12.785
<i>Wait, wait, wait.
Say that last part again?</i>

20:13.087 --> 20:17.502
"A court ought not be affected
by the weather of the day,

20:17.591 --> 20:20.584
"but will be by
the climate of the era."

20:24.473 --> 20:25.714
You're sure he said that?

20:29.186 --> 20:30.267
Of course.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.346
Of course.

20:36.902 --> 20:38.814
The law is never finished.

20:40.281 --> 20:42.364
It is a work in progress,

20:45.619 --> 20:47.531
and ever will be.

20:47.621 --> 20:50.113
<i>Brown v. the Board of Education,</i>

20:50.958 --> 20:53.120
parentheses, 1954,

20:53.419 --> 20:55.331
was the most revolutionary

20:56.672 --> 20:58.254
Supreme Court case

20:59.717 --> 21:01.128
in the last century.

21:04.388 --> 21:06.505
Representing Oliver Brown

21:07.850 --> 21:08.850
et al.,

21:09.810 --> 21:11.051
Thurgood Marshall...

21:11.145 --> 21:13.558
- I'm not listening.
- ...educated the court...

21:27.620 --> 21:28.827
Come on, Jane.

21:28.913 --> 21:30.825
That's it, come on, sweetie.

21:46.680 --> 21:47.761
Okay...

23:04.216 --> 23:05.832
<i>One, two, three...</i>

23:06.010 --> 23:07.592
Whoo!

23:07.678 --> 23:09.761
- One, two, three...
- One, two, three...

23:09.847 --> 23:11.032
Whoo!

23:11.056 --> 23:12.467
Should we give
Daddy a rest?

23:13.893 --> 23:16.306
Some day, this little angel's
gonna slam the door in our face

23:16.395 --> 23:18.352
and tell us that
we're ruining her life.

23:21.150 --> 23:22.812
I should've never
taken the job.

23:23.402 --> 23:24.768
It's a great firm.

23:25.112 --> 23:27.900
And New York is the center
of the legal universe.

23:28.741 --> 23:29.902
You earned it.

23:30.784 --> 23:32.150
You earned it.

23:32.244 --> 23:33.985
I barely survived it.

23:35.706 --> 23:37.914
I just don't wanna be away
from you and Jane.

23:38.375 --> 23:39.491
You won't be.

23:40.669 --> 23:41.830
I won't allow it.

23:42.880 --> 23:44.121
I'll convince him.

23:47.092 --> 23:49.254
- Say, "Good luck, Mommy."
- Good luck, Mommy.

23:50.137 --> 23:52.254
<i>You want
a Harvard law degree,</i>

23:52.348 --> 23:55.591
<i>though you plan to finish
your coursework at Columbia?</i>

23:56.977 --> 23:59.515
You would do well,
Mrs. Ginsburg,

23:59.605 --> 24:02.268
to remember how fortunate
you are to be here.

24:02.942 --> 24:04.228
Dean Griswold,

24:04.318 --> 24:07.186
between the first
and third year of law school,

24:07.488 --> 24:10.231
which is the more substantive,
the more critical?

24:10.407 --> 24:11.818
The first, of course.

24:11.909 --> 24:14.777
Yet when someone transfers in
as a second year student

24:14.870 --> 24:18.284
having taken those more important classes
elsewhere, he's allowed a degree.

24:18.415 --> 24:20.577
- That's irrelevant.
- I've been here two years.

24:20.751 --> 24:22.242
I'm first in my class.

24:22.419 --> 24:25.912
There is no reason your
husband cannot provide for you

24:26.006 --> 24:28.623
while you and the child
remain in Cambridge.

24:29.218 --> 24:32.962
Last year, John Sumner was allowed to
finish his course work at Baltimore.

24:33.389 --> 24:35.005
Three years ago,
Roy Paxton...

24:35.099 --> 24:37.056
- Very different cases.
- How are they different?

24:37.142 --> 24:40.431
Mrs. Ginsburg, you have no
compelling need to transfer.

24:44.650 --> 24:46.016
Marty could relapse.

24:48.237 --> 24:49.478
He beat the odds,

24:49.822 --> 24:52.235
but the doctors say
it could happen at any time.

24:56.996 --> 24:58.328
Dean Griswold,

25:00.124 --> 25:01.706
this is my family.

25:04.503 --> 25:05.835
Nonetheless,

25:06.922 --> 25:09.335
we each have
our responsibilities,

25:09.800 --> 25:13.714
and mine is to protect the
distinction of a Harvard law degree.

25:14.471 --> 25:16.463
I can't force you to stay,

25:18.392 --> 25:21.100
but I won't reward you
for leaving, either.

26:35.302 --> 26:37.089
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

26:37.971 --> 26:40.554
Graduating top of your class,
law review at Harvard

26:40.849 --> 26:42.090
and Columbia.

26:42.726 --> 26:44.217
I didn't even know
that was possible.

26:44.311 --> 26:45.893
Thank you, Mr. Greene.

26:46.271 --> 26:47.478
I've worked hard.

26:47.731 --> 26:49.688
Well, you'd want some
white-shoe firm.

26:49.775 --> 26:52.267
Big money cases,
complex legal maneuvers...

26:52.361 --> 26:55.354
No, I think Bibler and Greene
is the perfect fit.

26:55.906 --> 26:58.114
You handled the Mercer
bankruptcy last year...

26:58.200 --> 27:00.112
Come on. How many
have you been to?

27:00.702 --> 27:02.694
They all turned you down,
right? How many?

27:03.997 --> 27:05.158
Like 10?

27:07.167 --> 27:08.499
Twelve.

27:08.585 --> 27:11.043
A woman, a mother
and a Jew to boot.

27:12.256 --> 27:14.543
I'm surprised that many
let you through the door.

27:14.633 --> 27:16.966
One sent me to interview
for the secretarial pool.

27:18.137 --> 27:21.380
Another told me I'd be too busy
at bake sales to be effective.

27:21.807 --> 27:24.424
One partner closes clients
in the locker room at his club,

27:24.518 --> 27:26.555
so he said I'd be
out of the loop.

27:27.146 --> 27:30.264
Last week, I was told women are
too emotional to be lawyers.

27:30.357 --> 27:31.768
Then that same afternoon,

27:31.859 --> 27:35.023
that a woman graduating top of
her class must be a real ball buster

27:35.112 --> 27:36.819
and wouldn't make
a good colleague.

27:36.905 --> 27:39.318
I was asked when
I'd have my next baby,

27:39.658 --> 27:41.115
and whether I keep Shabbat.

27:42.411 --> 27:45.449
One interviewer told me
I had a sterling résumé,

27:45.539 --> 27:46.724
but they hired
a woman last year,

27:46.748 --> 27:48.476
and what in the world would
they want with two of us?

27:48.500 --> 27:49.707
You must be livid.

27:52.337 --> 27:54.750
My mother taught me
not to give way to emotions.

27:54.840 --> 27:56.172
Bullshit.

27:56.884 --> 27:59.422
You're angry. Good. Use it.

28:00.012 --> 28:02.049
I have to say, Mrs. Ginsburg,

28:02.389 --> 28:03.880
I'm very impressed.

28:03.974 --> 28:05.135
Mr. Greene,

28:05.893 --> 28:07.475
I wanna be a lawyer.

28:07.769 --> 28:09.852
I wanna represent clients
before the court

28:09.938 --> 28:11.474
in pursuit of justice.

28:11.565 --> 28:14.478
You can see, I...
I worked hard through school, I...

28:15.110 --> 28:17.602
I did everything I was
supposed to and I excelled.

28:17.696 --> 28:19.813
I swear it, I'll do
the same for you.

28:30.709 --> 28:33.372
The fact is that,
you know, we're a...

28:34.046 --> 28:35.753
A close-knit firm.

28:35.839 --> 28:38.582
Almost like family,
and, uh...

28:41.595 --> 28:42.881
But the wives,

28:44.556 --> 28:45.797
they get jealous.

29:17.214 --> 29:20.457
<i>"The prince
would marry her</i>

29:20.550 --> 29:23.509
<i>"whose foot would fit
the little slipper."</i>

29:25.722 --> 29:26.838
Kiki?

29:27.349 --> 29:30.137
- "First, he tried it on the..."
- Kik? Kik!

29:30.227 --> 29:32.219
- Where is everybody?
- "...princess."

29:32.312 --> 29:33.928
Oh, hi.

29:34.231 --> 29:36.143
Hello, sweet pea.
Come here.

29:36.233 --> 29:37.974
How was your day, hmm?

29:38.151 --> 29:39.767
I missed you.

29:39.861 --> 29:41.272
Did you have a nice day?

29:44.074 --> 29:45.190
Did you get the job?

29:45.909 --> 29:48.196
You got the job.
That's wonderful!

29:48.287 --> 29:49.368
Oh!

29:49.746 --> 29:51.453
So they're gonna give you
a corner office

29:51.540 --> 29:53.101
or you still gonna have to
jump through some hoops?

29:53.125 --> 29:54.957
It's not at Bibler and Greene.

29:55.168 --> 29:56.875
I wasn't what
they were looking for.

29:58.297 --> 29:59.413
That's okay.

29:59.506 --> 30:02.294
I told you one of the other firms
would come back. Which one was it?

30:04.469 --> 30:07.177
Clyde Ferguson left
his professorship at Rutgers.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.285
- Kiki.
- They haven't found another black man

30:10.309 --> 30:11.345
to replace him,

30:11.435 --> 30:14.178
so someone thought a woman
would be the next best thing.

30:22.362 --> 30:24.069
- Good news.
- You can't quit.

30:25.157 --> 30:27.343
There are more firms out there.
This is the biggest city

30:27.367 --> 30:29.554
and the most litigious country
in the history of the planet.

30:29.578 --> 30:31.535
- You can still...
- Marty, I got a job.

30:32.414 --> 30:34.121
Just open the champagne.

30:39.796 --> 30:40.832
Okay.

30:42.049 --> 30:43.335
Okay.

30:43.425 --> 30:44.666
Then let's celebrate.

30:52.684 --> 30:54.721
<i>Marriage of Figaro.</i>

31:00.609 --> 31:01.690
You know what I think?

31:01.943 --> 31:03.354
I think this is good.

31:03.612 --> 31:04.693
I think it's better.

31:05.489 --> 31:07.300
You won't be beholden to any firm.

31:07.324 --> 31:09.611
You won't have a partner
breathing down your neck.

31:09.701 --> 31:13.866
And also, a professor is free to
represent any client she chooses.

31:15.082 --> 31:18.746
As long as they don't mind a lawyer
who's never actually practiced law.

31:18.835 --> 31:19.835
Well,

31:20.170 --> 31:22.583
all I have to say is,

31:23.215 --> 31:25.457
hooray for Mommy.

31:27.219 --> 31:28.881
Cheers.

31:31.139 --> 31:32.346
Hooray for Mommy.

31:35.936 --> 31:37.302
Hooray for Mommy.

31:53.870 --> 31:55.515
<i>Hell no, we won't go!</i>

31:55.539 --> 31:57.155
<i>Hell no, we won't go!</i>

31:57.249 --> 31:58.785
Hell no, we won't go!

31:58.875 --> 32:00.662
Hell no, we won't go!

32:06.591 --> 32:07.672
No!

32:11.972 --> 32:13.634
<i>And now they're telling us</i>

32:13.723 --> 32:15.885
<i>there's gonna be
no prosecution.</i>

32:16.476 --> 32:18.763
<i>- Are we gonna stand for that?</i>
- No!

32:18.854 --> 32:21.722
<i>- Are we gonna die in Vietnam?</i>
- No!

32:21.815 --> 32:24.523
<i>- No! Hell no, we won't go!</i>
- Hell no, we won't go!

32:24.609 --> 32:26.271
Hell no, we won't go!

32:26.361 --> 32:28.068
Hell no, we won't go!

32:42.752 --> 32:44.368
I'm Professor Ginsburg.

32:44.963 --> 32:48.297
This is Sex Discrimination
and the Law.

32:49.426 --> 32:51.292
Some of my colleagues
will tell you

32:51.386 --> 32:53.594
that sex discrimination
doesn't exist.

32:53.680 --> 32:57.674
That I may as well be teaching the
legal rights of gnomes and fairies.

32:58.977 --> 33:00.593
We'll see if they're right.

33:02.481 --> 33:04.438
<i>Hoyt v. Florida.</i>

33:04.858 --> 33:06.975
State the facts
please, Miss...

33:07.486 --> 33:08.727
Valentin.

33:09.154 --> 33:10.986
Gwendolyn Hoyt was a housewife

33:11.072 --> 33:12.984
and her husband
was this asshole.

33:13.366 --> 33:15.779
Can you recall the specifics?

33:15.994 --> 33:18.202
He cheated on her.
He choked her.

33:18.455 --> 33:20.538
He'd rip off her clothes
and threaten to kill her.

33:20.707 --> 33:22.790
So, in statutory terms,

33:22.876 --> 33:24.083
he was a real asshole.

33:26.129 --> 33:29.839
On the night in question,
Clarence told his wife

33:29.925 --> 33:32.668
that he'd met another woman
and he was leaving her.

33:32.886 --> 33:36.129
How did Hoyt respond,
Miss Burton?

33:36.556 --> 33:38.889
She smashed in his skull
with a baseball bat.

33:39.184 --> 33:42.018
Then called an ambulance
while he was dying.

33:42.938 --> 33:46.648
The jury convicted Hoyt
for second-degree murder.

33:47.442 --> 33:49.308
And that's where
our story begins.

33:49.986 --> 33:51.727
A great civil rights lawyer

33:51.821 --> 33:54.108
took up Hoyt's appeal.

33:54.407 --> 33:55.773
Dorothy...

33:57.410 --> 33:58.617
Kenyon.

34:00.914 --> 34:03.281
On what grounds, Miss Roemer?

34:03.792 --> 34:06.751
That Florida's juries
violated the U.S. Constitution

34:06.836 --> 34:08.196
'cause there were
only men on them.

34:08.463 --> 34:11.251
Kenyon said that
if there were women on it,

34:11.341 --> 34:14.300
Hoyt may have been convicted of a
lesser crime, like manslaughter.

34:14.386 --> 34:16.172
But that law
makes sense, though.

34:17.138 --> 34:19.972
Women can't take care of their kids
if they're on some sequestered jury.

34:20.058 --> 34:21.969
- Oh, is that so?
- What?

34:22.060 --> 34:24.222
- Men are the mammoth hunters.
- Oh, my God.

34:24.312 --> 34:25.456
You're never
getting laid again.

34:25.480 --> 34:27.080
What about women
who don't have children?

34:27.107 --> 34:28.226
Or they're out of the house?

34:28.275 --> 34:30.891
Let the man stay home
and take care of his children.

34:31.235 --> 34:34.070
Hey, don't take it out on me.
I'm not holding my fiancée back.

34:34.155 --> 34:35.440
She's got two jobs.

34:35.532 --> 34:39.196
Which she can be fired from
just for marrying you.

34:40.078 --> 34:41.489
The law allows it.

34:42.414 --> 34:45.748
There are laws that say
women can't work overtime.

34:46.710 --> 34:49.668
And that a woman's
Social Security benefits,

34:49.754 --> 34:51.335
unlike her husband's,

34:51.547 --> 34:53.710
don't provide for
a family after death.

34:53.800 --> 34:54.840
- What?
- Excuse me?

34:54.884 --> 34:56.320
- That's bullshit.
- That's crazy.

34:56.344 --> 34:59.428
Ten years ago,
Dorothy Kenyon asked a question.

35:00.390 --> 35:02.848
"If the law differentiates
on the basis of sex,

35:02.934 --> 35:05.472
"then how will women and men
ever become equals?"

35:06.104 --> 35:07.766
And the Supreme Court
answered,

35:08.356 --> 35:09.597
"They won't."

35:10.066 --> 35:11.728
Hoyt lost her appeal.

35:12.193 --> 35:14.276
The decision was unanimous.

35:14.654 --> 35:17.362
Discrimination on
the basis of sex

35:17.449 --> 35:18.690
is legal.

35:33.381 --> 35:34.667
Here, stir that in.

35:34.758 --> 35:37.375
Hmm. Daddy, that's not
how you do it.

35:37.594 --> 35:38.594
Oh, really?

35:38.678 --> 35:41.546
If you put the herbs in too early,
they lose all their punch.

35:41.640 --> 35:43.326
Well, they're not supposed
to pummel each other, Jane,

35:43.350 --> 35:45.453
they're supposed to complement
each other, and that is why it's called

35:45.477 --> 35:46.996
- "marrying the flavors."
- We're home!

35:47.020 --> 35:49.137
- Hi!
- Daddy!

35:49.230 --> 35:50.641
Buddy!

35:51.107 --> 35:52.439
- How was your day?
- Good.

35:52.567 --> 35:54.003
- You have a good day at school?
- Uh-huh.

35:54.027 --> 35:55.768
What'd you learn?
Anything exciting?

35:56.404 --> 35:57.770
- Not really.
- Hi.

35:57.864 --> 35:59.321
- Hi.
- Hi.

36:00.533 --> 36:02.195
- Jane.
- Hey, Mom.

36:02.285 --> 36:03.617
How's this year's class?

36:04.954 --> 36:07.617
Oh, these kids
are so passionate.

36:08.041 --> 36:12.001
To them it's about more than
precedents and dissents.

36:12.087 --> 36:14.170
- They wanna forge a movement.
- That's great.

36:14.255 --> 36:15.917
Mmm!
This is delicious.

36:16.091 --> 36:18.083
- Don't act so surprised.
- Jane?

36:19.344 --> 36:21.552
I got a call from
your school today.

36:22.681 --> 36:25.298
Apparently,
I misdated a note

36:25.642 --> 36:27.884
excusing you from classes
last week.

36:28.019 --> 36:30.762
I- t's not a big deal.
- Oh, well, problem solved then, right?

36:30.855 --> 36:32.266
You skipped school, it's...

36:32.357 --> 36:35.521
It's the first week.
Is this what this year's gonna be like?

36:35.652 --> 36:37.004
- And you lied to the school...
- I never lied.

36:37.028 --> 36:39.111
No, forging a note
is lying, Jane.

36:39.531 --> 36:41.113
You're smart enough
to know that.

36:41.908 --> 36:43.524
Well, apparently
I'm not, Mom.

36:47.122 --> 36:49.042
Don't forget we have
that party tonight. Not you.

36:49.124 --> 36:51.411
- Jane!
- I apologized, okay?

36:51.501 --> 36:53.117
I wanna know
where you were.

36:53.378 --> 36:56.166
Denise and I went to a rally
to hear Gloria Steinem speak.

36:57.090 --> 36:58.126
What?

36:58.550 --> 36:59.791
Gloria Steinem.

37:00.009 --> 37:02.376
She's a writer.
She just started her own magazine.

37:02.512 --> 37:05.721
- She testified in the Senate...
- Yeah, I know who Gloria Steinem is.

37:06.182 --> 37:07.969
What if you got hurt
or arrested?

37:08.059 --> 37:10.096
Mom, it's a rally,
not a riot.

37:10.228 --> 37:12.790
- Jane, these things can get out of hand.
- Okay, well, I'm 15 years old

37:12.814 --> 37:14.542
and you don't need to control
every minute of my life.

37:14.566 --> 37:17.559
Yes, I do. That is my job.
And your job is to go to school and learn.

37:17.652 --> 37:20.486
Well, Gloria says we need to
unlearn the status quo.

37:20.572 --> 37:22.780
Oh. So you're on
a first-name basis now?

37:22.866 --> 37:24.152
You know what, Mom?

37:24.325 --> 37:27.489
If you wanna sit around with your students
and talk about how shitty it is

37:27.579 --> 37:28.681
- to be a girl...
- Hey! Language.

37:28.705 --> 37:30.367
But don't pretend
it's a movement, okay?

37:30.457 --> 37:32.870
It's not a movement
if everyone's just sitting.

37:33.460 --> 37:35.952
- That's a support group.
- Jane. That's enough.

37:40.008 --> 37:41.215
We should get going.

37:41.301 --> 37:43.384
Yeah, go make yourself pretty
for Daddy's party.

37:46.139 --> 37:48.051
- You know what? Go to your room.
- Fine.

37:51.561 --> 37:52.927
No, no, it's well-known.

37:53.021 --> 37:55.980
Tax is the only genuinely
funny area of the law.

37:56.065 --> 37:59.185
And I think most of us just want
careers that have a little more, uh...

37:59.360 --> 38:00.942
- ...impact.
- Hmm.

38:02.155 --> 38:04.175
You know, young people in Sweden
these days aren't getting married?

38:04.199 --> 38:05.406
Really?

38:05.492 --> 38:07.825
- It's true. They're getting engaged.
- Hmm.

38:08.578 --> 38:10.114
They're still
living together.

38:10.747 --> 38:12.488
Still having kids,
raising a family,

38:12.582 --> 38:14.539
but they're not getting married.
You know why?

38:14.626 --> 38:16.066
They can
have sex without it.

38:18.922 --> 38:20.379
It's because of taxes.

38:22.258 --> 38:24.170
It's true. After the war,
Sweden passed a law

38:24.260 --> 38:27.549
that said married couples will
now file joint income tax returns.

38:27.639 --> 38:29.221
However, unlike
the United States,

38:29.307 --> 38:31.147
they weren't given
any of the benefits from it.

38:31.392 --> 38:35.056
So, married Swedes were finding
themselves in the uncomfortable position

38:35.146 --> 38:37.183
of now being in
a higher tax bracket.

38:37.357 --> 38:39.557
- Really?
- So they got divorced.

38:39.984 --> 38:41.664
Of course, they were
still living together.

38:41.694 --> 38:44.186
So the Swedish government
then passes a new law that says,

38:44.280 --> 38:46.146
"All right. Married couples
who get divorced

38:46.241 --> 38:48.699
"but continue to live together
for tax purposes

38:48.785 --> 38:50.617
"will be considered
still married."

38:50.703 --> 38:51.983
So they did what
anyone would do.

38:52.038 --> 38:53.620
They add a second entrance
to their home

38:53.706 --> 38:56.289
with a nice wall that goes
right down the middle

38:56.376 --> 38:58.083
with doors for
easy access.

38:58.211 --> 39:02.330
"All right, fine," says the Swedish government, "new law.

39:02.799 --> 39:06.964
"Once married, now divorced
couples living in a two-income household

39:07.053 --> 39:11.047
"that is subdivided would,"
again, for tax purposes,

39:11.808 --> 39:13.577
"be considered living together,
and therefore..."

39:13.601 --> 39:15.058
Therefore, still married.

39:15.144 --> 39:19.013
Now he's got it.
And this went on for decades.

39:19.107 --> 39:20.894
All the while,
a whole generation of Swedes

39:20.984 --> 39:23.692
simply skirted the issue by never
getting married in the first place.

39:24.654 --> 39:26.771
Speaking of, have you all met
my lovely wife, Ruth?

39:26.948 --> 39:30.783
The moral of his story is that in
their attempt to raise revenue,

39:30.869 --> 39:33.031
the Swedish government
ruined all those young men's

39:33.121 --> 39:34.282
best hope at happiness.

39:34.706 --> 39:35.742
Exactly.

39:36.249 --> 39:39.083
Because how a government
taxes its citizens

39:39.168 --> 39:42.127
is a direct declaration
of a country's values.

39:42.380 --> 39:44.872
So tell me, what could have
more impact than that?

39:47.010 --> 39:48.501
You'd be wise
to listen, boys.

39:48.595 --> 39:50.427
I swear to Christ,

39:50.513 --> 39:53.301
Martin Ginsburg will be signing
all of our checks someday.

39:55.476 --> 39:57.718
You're a smart girl, Ruthy,
you married a star.

40:01.065 --> 40:03.022
Tom Maller's barely evolved.

40:03.109 --> 40:05.226
He started walking
upright last week.

40:05.612 --> 40:07.604
- You always do that.
- What?

40:07.780 --> 40:10.147
- You act like it doesn't matter.
- No.

40:10.241 --> 40:12.073
But all the little
brush-offs,

40:12.160 --> 40:15.653
the dismissive pats on the head, it...
It matters, Marty.

40:15.747 --> 40:19.286
Why? You know what you're doing is important.
So who cares?

40:20.835 --> 40:23.623
Okay, fine. Next time my boss
gives me a clumsy compliment,

40:23.713 --> 40:25.079
I'll challenge him to a duel.

40:25.173 --> 40:26.289
Will that make you happy?

40:26.382 --> 40:28.624
I wouldn't wanna hurt
your stellar reputation.

40:28.718 --> 40:31.586
- Just tell me what you want.
- Nothing!

40:32.055 --> 40:34.172
I want nothing.
I want you to go to work

40:34.265 --> 40:35.676
and wow your
bosses and clients,

40:35.767 --> 40:37.008
and be the youngest partner

40:37.101 --> 40:38.329
- in the history of the firm.
- That's not fair.

40:38.353 --> 40:39.872
- That's not fair and you know it.
- Then I want you to walk

40:39.896 --> 40:42.333
me home, Marty, so I can sit in my corner
and write a lesson plan to inspire

40:42.357 --> 40:44.001
- the next generation of students...
- No one's pushing you

40:44.025 --> 40:45.586
- in the corner.
- ...to go forth and fight for equality.

40:45.610 --> 40:48.774
I don't understand why you're acting
like that's such a bad thing.

40:49.197 --> 40:51.484
You're out there training
the next generation of lawyers

40:51.574 --> 40:52.574
to change the world.

40:52.659 --> 40:54.696
Because that's what
I wanted to do!

41:02.168 --> 41:03.659
Kiki. Kiki.

41:15.306 --> 41:16.547
Page 21.

41:18.518 --> 41:20.601
I don't read tax court cases.

41:20.687 --> 41:21.848
Read this one.

41:22.146 --> 41:24.354
The IRS denied a petitioner
a tax deduction

41:24.440 --> 41:26.853
to hire a nurse to take care
of an invalid mother.

41:28.111 --> 41:30.478
- Sounds like a real page turner.
- Hmm.

41:30.738 --> 41:33.276
- Ask me why.
- Marty, I have a lecture to write.

41:33.700 --> 41:35.441
Hmm. Okay.

41:38.496 --> 41:41.159
It's because the petitioner
is a man.

41:46.337 --> 41:47.623
Marty.

41:48.965 --> 41:51.628
Section 214 of the Tax Code

41:51.718 --> 41:54.802
assumes a caregiver
has to be a woman.

41:56.806 --> 42:01.346
This is sex-based
discrimination against a man.

42:03.229 --> 42:04.891
Poor guy.

42:05.523 --> 42:07.230
If a federal court

42:08.151 --> 42:09.938
ruled that this law

42:10.445 --> 42:12.732
is unconstitutional,

42:12.822 --> 42:14.438
then it could become
the precedent

42:14.532 --> 42:16.865
others refer to
and build on.

42:17.493 --> 42:19.075
Men and women both.

42:20.955 --> 42:24.790
It could topple the whole damn
system of discrimination.

42:28.004 --> 42:29.211
What?

42:29.297 --> 42:30.504
Nothing.

42:30.757 --> 42:33.921
I'm just thrilled at your newfound
enthusiasm for tax law.

42:34.385 --> 42:35.546
Marty.

42:35.636 --> 42:36.672
Oh.

42:37.680 --> 42:38.921
And Marty,

42:40.349 --> 42:42.136
we need to take this case.

42:55.865 --> 42:57.857
Of course he says he's against
bombing Cambodia.

42:57.950 --> 42:59.691
I wanna know,
where's the bill to defund it?

42:59.786 --> 43:01.666
It's derogatory,
it's taunting, but it's speech.

43:02.163 --> 43:04.075
Mel Wulf is expecting me.

43:04.165 --> 43:06.435
He wants to get his hands on Nixon,
or he hopes the Viet Cong do?

43:06.459 --> 43:07.791
Well, why?
What's the difference?

43:08.169 --> 43:10.331
Five years in prison. Go.

43:13.841 --> 43:16.299
<i>Oh</i>

43:16.385 --> 43:20.504
<i>I'm an acorn, short and round
Lying on the dusty ground</i>

43:20.598 --> 43:23.807
<i>Everybody steps on me
That is why I'm cracked You see</i>

43:23.893 --> 43:26.351
<i>I'm a nut, I'm a nut
I'm a nut</i>

43:26.437 --> 43:27.437
Come on.

43:27.522 --> 43:30.356
<i>I'm a nut, I'm a nut
I'm a nut</i>

43:30.942 --> 43:33.685
<i>I'm a nut, I'm a nut
I'm a nut</i>

43:33.778 --> 43:34.778
Wow.

43:34.862 --> 43:36.569
<i>Oh, I'm a nut
But that's no sin</i>

43:36.656 --> 43:39.023
<i>'Cause at Camp Che-Na-Wah
I fit right in</i>

43:40.535 --> 43:41.867
Ladies and gentlemen,

43:41.953 --> 43:46.573
three-time Camp Che-Na-Wah
All-Around Camper, Ruth "Kiki" Bader.

43:49.585 --> 43:51.793
Oh, and for all you
who think this job is hard,

43:51.879 --> 43:54.917
I judged the 13-and-unders
with a color war trophy on the line.

43:55.007 --> 43:57.374
Back to work.

43:58.845 --> 44:00.552
Hey, Kiki.
What do you say?

44:03.057 --> 44:04.798
Hi, Mel.

44:05.476 --> 44:06.592
Sorry about that.

44:09.522 --> 44:10.933
You said you had a case.

44:11.482 --> 44:12.689
This is not a case.

44:12.775 --> 44:15.734
This is the opening salvo on a 50-year
war for a new class of civil rights.

44:15.820 --> 44:17.231
Yes! Exactly!

44:17.989 --> 44:19.855
I can't do this.
It's beyond my mandate.

44:19.949 --> 44:22.191
American Civil
Liberties Union?

44:23.035 --> 44:24.367
Women's rights
are civil rights.

44:24.453 --> 44:26.661
I'm still getting flak for
defending draft card burners.

44:26.998 --> 44:28.955
And the right to protest
actually exists.

44:29.250 --> 44:30.457
After you.

44:30.543 --> 44:31.624
Here.

44:34.547 --> 44:35.913
Lois, can I get a...

44:45.766 --> 44:46.847
How's Marty?

44:49.061 --> 44:50.142
He's fine.

44:51.022 --> 44:54.186
Still protecting the rich against
the predations of the poor?

44:56.736 --> 44:58.352
If we're gonna appeal,

44:58.613 --> 45:01.697
the court needs to agree there's
a constitutional handle in here.

45:01.782 --> 45:04.195
How did you even convince this
guy to let you represent him?

45:04.285 --> 45:05.776
I... I'll take care of that.

45:05.953 --> 45:07.073
- He doesn't know?
- Alone...

45:07.163 --> 45:08.404
- Are you kidding me?
- Alone,

45:08.497 --> 45:10.454
the judges may not
give Marty and I

45:10.541 --> 45:11.768
- the benefit of the doubt.
- Oh.

45:11.792 --> 45:14.580
But with your name
alongside ours on the brief...

45:15.338 --> 45:16.419
Yeah.

45:17.256 --> 45:21.250
Mel, you must see the opportunity
this case represents.

45:21.844 --> 45:23.280
You think the judges
are gonna be sympathetic

45:23.304 --> 45:24.704
just 'cause they
all have prostates?

45:25.389 --> 45:27.201
Men and women all eat
at the same lunch counters,

45:27.225 --> 45:29.203
they drink at the same water fountains,
they go to the same schools...

45:29.227 --> 45:31.330
- Women can't attend Dartmouth.
- Men can't go to Smith.

45:31.354 --> 45:34.847
Women police officers can't
patrol New York City streets.

45:35.191 --> 45:36.272
We have to get...

45:39.195 --> 45:42.404
We have to get credit cards
in our husband's names.

45:42.490 --> 45:43.981
You're not a minority.

45:44.116 --> 45:46.153
You're 51% of the population!

45:46.577 --> 45:48.785
It's been tried.
Muller, Goesaert, uh...

45:48.871 --> 45:51.266
What's the other one?
The one with the woman with the baseball bat.

45:51.290 --> 45:53.202
- Gwendolyn Hoyt.
- Gwendolyn Hoyt, exactly.

45:53.292 --> 45:55.579
- And morally, they were right.
- Yet they lost.

45:56.671 --> 45:59.459
Ruth, morality
does not win the day.

45:59.548 --> 46:00.709
Look around you.

46:01.175 --> 46:03.667
Dorothy Kenyon
could not get women equality

46:03.761 --> 46:06.720
by arguing a case with sex, murder
and prison time on the line.

46:06.889 --> 46:10.178
You and Marty think you're gonna
do it with this guy and his taxes?

46:48.472 --> 46:49.804
Operator.

46:50.808 --> 46:52.640
I... I need a number.

46:54.020 --> 46:56.057
Denver, Colorado.

46:56.939 --> 46:58.375
<i>Come on,
you're gonna miss your flight!</i>

46:58.399 --> 47:00.719
Now, you have to get James
from school while I'm in Denver.

47:00.776 --> 47:01.776
Mom, I told you,

47:01.861 --> 47:04.194
Denise and I are starting
our consciousness raising group.

47:04.280 --> 47:05.737
Take James with you.

47:07.283 --> 47:09.320
- You'll be all right?
- Yeah.

47:09.577 --> 47:11.068
We'll survive somehow.

47:11.787 --> 47:13.323
Bye. Bye.

47:14.707 --> 47:15.868
Go kick ass.

47:16.042 --> 47:17.158
Meter's running.

47:18.169 --> 47:19.330
Bye, Mom.

47:20.129 --> 47:21.995
- Bye.
- Bye, Mom.

47:39.148 --> 47:40.184
Thank you.

47:53.704 --> 47:57.163
- Mr. Moritz.
- Mrs. Ginsburg. You're early.

47:59.460 --> 48:01.873
I can come back
in 10 minutes if you prefer.

48:01.962 --> 48:03.043
No, you might...

48:03.798 --> 48:05.915
Might as well come in now
and have your say.

48:07.843 --> 48:09.004
Shoes off, please.

48:11.972 --> 48:13.008
Just come on in.

48:13.766 --> 48:14.847
Excuse me.

48:16.685 --> 48:19.519
- You done, Mom?
- No. Not yet.

48:20.898 --> 48:22.751
- I'm done, thank you.
- You want your crossword?

48:22.775 --> 48:24.294
- Yeah, please.
- Okay.

48:27.279 --> 48:28.315
Here you go.

48:30.574 --> 48:32.236
- Mom...
- Uh-huh?

48:32.326 --> 48:33.487
This is Mrs. Ginsburg.

48:33.577 --> 48:35.614
She's the New York lawyer
I told you about.

48:35.704 --> 48:37.696
Mrs. Moritz, hello.

48:37.790 --> 48:39.702
I thought she would be bigger.

48:43.337 --> 48:44.498
You can have a seat.

48:45.506 --> 48:46.506
Here you go.

48:46.590 --> 48:48.350
- Do you want your magnifier?
- Yeah, please.

48:48.426 --> 48:50.292
Okay.
Here you go. All right?

48:51.220 --> 48:52.780
- You want a drink?
- Uh-huh.

48:57.226 --> 49:00.594
I see you were a drum major.
I was a twirler.

49:01.105 --> 49:02.516
It was a thousand years ago.

49:08.612 --> 49:11.946
- Mr. Moritz, about your case...
- I don't have a case.

49:13.117 --> 49:15.029
Four lawyers told me so.

49:15.870 --> 49:17.736
And that judge, Tietjens,

49:18.414 --> 49:21.122
- he basically called me a tax cheat.
- Are you?

49:22.835 --> 49:25.293
I never cheated
at anything in my life.

49:25.379 --> 49:27.211
Tasmanian egg layer.

49:27.298 --> 49:28.334
Eight letters.

49:28.591 --> 49:29.877
Not now, Mom.

49:32.344 --> 49:36.463
Tell me in your own words,
why did you hire a nurse?

49:37.057 --> 49:39.094
If you've never cared
for an ailing parent...

49:39.185 --> 49:40.185
I have.

49:41.312 --> 49:42.393
Then you know.

49:42.480 --> 49:44.847
Between the dressing
and the bathing and the toilet,

49:45.566 --> 49:49.150
it's not a task for one person,
especially if you have a day job.

49:49.236 --> 49:52.604
If it wasn't for Cleeta,
I'd have to put Mom in a home.

49:52.698 --> 49:55.315
So you deducted Cleeta's
salary on your taxes.

49:55.409 --> 49:57.947
The judge said
the tax code was clear.

49:58.454 --> 50:00.912
Caretaker's deduction was
available to all women,

50:00.998 --> 50:04.787
but only to men who had wives
who were incapacitated

50:04.877 --> 50:06.789
or dead or were divorced.

50:06.921 --> 50:08.708
- And you've never been married.
- No.

50:08.797 --> 50:11.790
The men who wrote that law
couldn't even fathom that a bachelor

50:12.426 --> 50:15.043
choosing to take care
of a parent at home might exist.

50:15.137 --> 50:18.926
Tasmanian egg layer,
second letter "L."

50:19.058 --> 50:22.051
- Mom, I'll help you in a little bit.
- How about "platypus"?

50:24.939 --> 50:25.975
Ah!

50:30.069 --> 50:32.026
I'm a salesman,
Mrs. Ginsburg.

50:33.405 --> 50:35.317
And I know
when I'm being sold.

50:38.202 --> 50:39.568
With due respect,

50:40.454 --> 50:44.243
you have $296 at issue.
I'm not here for the money.

50:45.167 --> 50:48.626
We'd represent your appeal
pro bono, if you'll let us.

50:48.712 --> 50:51.079
So, the judge was wrong?

50:51.173 --> 50:55.463
Mr. Moritz,
the law is wrong.

51:00.766 --> 51:02.177
Thank you. I was hungry.

51:05.229 --> 51:06.845
If it's not for the money,

51:08.399 --> 51:09.560
why are you here?

51:14.113 --> 51:16.981
The 14th Amendment to the
United States Constitution says

51:17.074 --> 51:19.612
all people must be treated
equally under the law.

51:20.369 --> 51:23.157
Yet there are I don't know
how many laws

51:23.247 --> 51:26.115
like the caregiver deduction
that say in effect,

51:26.208 --> 51:29.872
women stay home, men go to work,
and that it should stay that way forever.

51:30.796 --> 51:32.537
I want to convince
the federal courts

51:32.631 --> 51:36.341
that those laws
are unconstitutional.

51:36.760 --> 51:37.876
How do you do that?

51:39.972 --> 51:43.340
One case at a time,
starting with yours.

51:44.476 --> 51:45.762
So I'm a guinea pig?

51:47.354 --> 51:48.390
No, sir.

51:50.065 --> 51:52.728
You're the man marching out
ahead of the band leading the way.

51:54.153 --> 51:56.566
Just like that drum major
you used to be.

51:58.407 --> 52:02.321
I've invested a lot of my own
reputation building up your career

52:02.411 --> 52:03.743
and now you're
on track to be

52:03.829 --> 52:06.537
the youngest partner
in the history of the firm.

52:06.624 --> 52:10.038
And you want to risk that
for some cockamamie case?

52:10.628 --> 52:15.339
Tom, I'm contractually obligated to ask
to take outside work, and I'm asking.

52:15.424 --> 52:18.212
For God's sakes, you're
traipsing into this for what?

52:18.552 --> 52:20.509
So your wife can feel
like a real lawyer?

52:21.555 --> 52:23.547
She is a real lawyer, Tom.

52:23.641 --> 52:25.849
You wanna support Ruth,
tell her the truth.

52:26.101 --> 52:28.184
- Which is?
- The case is unwinnable.

52:28.771 --> 52:30.854
Congress can write
whatever taxes it wants,

52:30.939 --> 52:33.022
that's not open to
constitutional attack.

52:33.108 --> 52:34.474
Yes, but maybe
you just say that

52:34.568 --> 52:36.768
because no one's been able
to successfully do it before.

52:37.321 --> 52:38.321
Oh, Marty.

52:39.448 --> 52:40.984
Fine. Try it, but...

52:41.950 --> 52:45.034
When you lose
and you embarrass our firm,

52:45.120 --> 52:47.515
just be ready for your career
to come crashing back to earth.

52:47.539 --> 52:49.371
Okay. Noted. Noted.
And thank you, Tom.

52:49.500 --> 52:51.583
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

52:51.669 --> 52:55.288
No! Murder can never be condoned,
least of all by a lawyer.

52:55.381 --> 52:56.622
It's called justice.

52:56.715 --> 52:59.628
Yeah, what's just to you may not be
just to me or to someone else.

52:59.718 --> 53:01.988
- You know what I'm talking about.
- Hello, family unit.

53:02.012 --> 53:05.756
And would it kill you to admit that maybe
I actually did something right?

53:05.849 --> 53:07.556
This is an A paper.

53:07.643 --> 53:09.885
Yeah, of course it is.
You're a beautiful writer.

53:09.978 --> 53:11.185
It just needs more work.

53:11.855 --> 53:15.064
Please tell me you aren't going 15 rounds
over <i>To Kill a Mockingbird.</i>

53:15.150 --> 53:18.518
Daddy, can you please tell Mom
that Atticus Finch can be a role model.

53:18.612 --> 53:21.320
He covers up Bob Ewell's murder.
He is a terrible lawyer.

53:21.407 --> 53:23.569
- Why? 'Cause you say so?
- No. Not me.

53:23.659 --> 53:25.992
Canon one of
the American Bar Association's

53:26.078 --> 53:27.614
Model Code of Responsibility.

53:27.705 --> 53:28.991
What are you
talking about?

53:29.081 --> 53:30.947
It's called legal ethics.

53:31.291 --> 53:34.125
Well, you'd do exactly the same
thing if you actually had a heart.

53:40.718 --> 53:42.478
I don't know where
she gets her stubbornness.

53:42.970 --> 53:44.177
Can't imagine.

53:45.931 --> 53:47.012
So, how was your day?

53:54.106 --> 53:58.020
"History discloses that woman has
always been dependent upon man.

53:58.694 --> 54:01.528
"Like children,
she needs special care.

54:01.613 --> 54:03.775
"This justifies a difference
in legislation."

54:03.866 --> 54:05.573
<i>Muller v. Oregon.</i>
The law of the land.

54:05.993 --> 54:08.030
Or <i>Bradwell v. Illinois.</i>

54:09.121 --> 54:12.990
"The destiny of a woman is the
benign offices of wife and mother.

54:13.333 --> 54:14.824
"This is the law
of the Creator."

54:15.586 --> 54:18.329
I'm writing this brief
and citing the same cases

54:18.422 --> 54:22.132
with the exact same precedents
as everyone before us.

54:22.968 --> 54:25.676
Marty, if this is what we go in with,
we're gonna lose.

54:28.390 --> 54:29.990
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

54:30.017 --> 54:31.349
I got it. I got it.

54:32.603 --> 54:34.720
At least she's not listening
to The Monkees.

54:39.276 --> 54:40.858
I'm busy.

55:01.089 --> 55:02.830
Come here.
Come here.

55:12.226 --> 55:13.433
I'm fine.

55:15.813 --> 55:17.349
I can be
as tough as she is.

55:18.774 --> 55:19.981
She's a bully.

55:21.443 --> 55:24.060
And she needs everyone
to know how smart she is.

55:26.949 --> 55:29.282
Do you want Mom
to stop being smart?

55:30.536 --> 55:33.825
I want her to stop rubbing it in
everyone's face all the time.

55:40.754 --> 55:44.873
Grandma Celia died
when Mom was about your age.

55:46.134 --> 55:47.921
But up until her dying breath,

55:48.428 --> 55:52.138
they would read together,
debate ideas together.

55:53.851 --> 55:57.390
And she taught your mom
to question everything.

55:58.522 --> 56:01.139
She's not trying
to bully you, Jane.

56:01.483 --> 56:03.975
She just doesn't want you
to feel small.

56:05.028 --> 56:09.193
She wants to give you
what her mom taught her.

56:11.535 --> 56:12.821
That's how she

56:14.621 --> 56:15.953
shows her heart.

56:16.832 --> 56:17.913
Hmm?

56:37.436 --> 56:38.517
Is she okay?

56:40.105 --> 56:41.141
She'll be fine.

56:52.492 --> 56:55.485
This is stupid. You're the one who said
I'm supposed to be in school.

56:55.829 --> 56:58.162
If you're gonna write about
great American lawyers,

56:58.248 --> 56:59.489
you may as well meet one.

57:14.181 --> 57:15.467
You ladies look lost.

57:18.560 --> 57:19.676
Well, spit it out.

57:20.687 --> 57:22.849
Miss Kenyon,
we're here to see you.

57:23.607 --> 57:24.893
I tried to make
an appointment...

57:24.983 --> 57:26.975
Well, here I am.
I don't have all day.

57:27.903 --> 57:30.190
It's about Gwendolyn Hoyt.

57:30.989 --> 57:32.446
In that case,
I've no interest

57:32.532 --> 57:33.772
in talking to either
one of you.

57:33.825 --> 57:35.691
I'm arguing a case.

57:35.786 --> 57:38.494
Sex discrimination violates the
equal protection principle.

57:38.580 --> 57:42.119
Equal protection was coined to
grant equality to the negro.

57:42.334 --> 57:44.792
A task at which it has
dismally failed.

57:44.878 --> 57:46.870
What makes you think
women would fare any better?

57:46.964 --> 57:48.125
Please, if we could
just talk.

57:48.215 --> 57:50.673
You wanna know
how I blew it. Is that it?

57:51.051 --> 57:52.337
What I'd do differently?

57:52.594 --> 57:54.586
Why? You think you can
change the country?

57:55.472 --> 57:57.088
You should look
to her generation.

57:57.391 --> 57:58.723
They're taking
to the streets.

57:58.809 --> 58:02.098
Demanding change. Like we did
when we fought for the vote.

58:02.437 --> 58:04.349
Our mistake was thinking
we had won.

58:04.856 --> 58:06.313
We started asking please,

58:06.817 --> 58:10.231
as if civil rights were sweets
to be handed out by judges.

58:10.320 --> 58:11.606
Protests are important.

58:11.697 --> 58:14.735
But changing the culture means
nothing if the law doesn't change.

58:15.409 --> 58:17.196
As a lawyer, you must
believe that.

58:18.036 --> 58:19.072
Let me guess.

58:20.414 --> 58:22.121
You're a professor,
aren't you?

58:22.833 --> 58:23.949
Yeah.

58:24.042 --> 58:26.034
Ton of knowledge
and no smarts.

58:26.128 --> 58:28.415
- Mom, we should go.
- You want advice?

58:28.630 --> 58:29.791
Here it is.

58:29.881 --> 58:32.749
Tell your client she won't
find equality in a courtroom.

58:32.843 --> 58:35.256
My client's name
is Charles Moritz.

58:35.429 --> 58:36.510
That's cute.

58:37.055 --> 58:40.423
He hired a nurse to
take care of his mother, but

58:41.059 --> 58:43.893
he was denied a caregiver
deduction on his taxes.

58:44.521 --> 58:45.853
He's never been married.

58:46.898 --> 58:49.857
You found a bachelor taking
care of his mother at home.

58:53.238 --> 58:54.854
The judges will be
repulsed by him.

58:55.657 --> 58:57.319
Feeling anything is a start.

58:59.995 --> 59:01.486
What did you say
your name was?

59:02.539 --> 59:04.246
Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

59:06.001 --> 59:09.119
Well, sorry,
Professor Ginsburg.

59:09.921 --> 59:11.503
Maybe someday.

59:11.590 --> 59:13.126
But the country isn't ready.

59:14.134 --> 59:16.421
Change minds first,

59:16.511 --> 59:17.752
then change the law.

59:18.930 --> 59:22.014
If you'll excuse me, the mayor has
decided to rename the neighborhood.

59:22.100 --> 59:25.093
So now a developer is kicking
30 families out of a building

59:25.187 --> 59:27.053
he abandoned 10 years ago.

59:28.356 --> 59:31.394
SoHo. Who ever heard
of such a ridiculous thing.

59:33.278 --> 59:36.567
I know she's your personal hero
and all, but she's kind of a bitch.

59:36.656 --> 59:38.272
No, she's formidable.

59:38.366 --> 59:40.483
Dorothy Kenyon has been
fighting for women's rights

59:40.577 --> 59:43.820
and civil rights and labor rights
her entire career.

59:44.122 --> 59:47.957
She didn't always win, but she made
damn sure she was taken seriously.

59:48.085 --> 59:51.005
She didn't help you. What are you going to do now?

59:51.046 --> 59:53.834
It's the right cause.
It's the right client.

59:54.466 --> 59:57.254
But women have been losing this
same argument for over a century.

59:58.553 --> 01:00:02.092
Well, just because you lost
100 years before you started

01:00:02.182 --> 01:00:03.764
is no reason
not to try to win.

01:00:06.561 --> 01:00:08.177
Jane, that was very wise.

01:00:09.898 --> 01:00:11.264
You know who said it first?

01:00:13.568 --> 01:00:14.729
Atticus Finch.

01:00:20.158 --> 01:00:21.158
Quick!

01:00:22.953 --> 01:00:24.694
Hey, looking good, ladies!

01:00:24.830 --> 01:00:26.366
Just ignore them.

01:00:26.748 --> 01:00:28.785
Hey, we'll keep you warm
if you're getting wet!

01:00:30.127 --> 01:00:31.584
Oh, yeah? Real nice!

01:00:32.170 --> 01:00:34.412
You kiss your mother
with that mouth, asshole?

01:00:34.506 --> 01:00:35.997
Whoa, whoa!

01:00:36.091 --> 01:00:38.128
Mom, you can't let boys
talk to you like that.

01:00:38.969 --> 01:00:40.085
Taxi!

01:00:46.101 --> 01:00:47.262
Mom, come on!

01:00:47.811 --> 01:00:48.927
You're getting soaked.

01:00:49.604 --> 01:00:50.720
Look at you, Jane.

01:00:51.773 --> 01:00:55.016
You're a liberated,
fearless young woman.

01:00:55.485 --> 01:00:57.805
Twenty years ago, you couldn't
have been who you are today.

01:00:58.488 --> 01:01:00.150
Dorothy Kenyon's wrong.

01:01:00.991 --> 01:01:03.074
The times have already changed.

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:05.400
- You coming or what?
- Yeah, yeah, we're coming.

01:01:08.081 --> 01:01:10.001
<i>It's what
Professor Freund said at Harvard.</i>

01:01:10.542 --> 01:01:13.455
"A court ought not be affected
by the weather of the day,

01:01:13.545 --> 01:01:15.377
"but will be by
the climate of the era."

01:01:15.839 --> 01:01:18.377
Okay, so we're not going back
and re-fighting old cases?

01:01:18.466 --> 01:01:21.959
No, we're arguing that the
precedents should no longer apply.

01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:24.907
Right. But Ruth, Freund was talking
about <i>Brown v. the Board of Education.</i>

01:01:24.931 --> 01:01:26.342
That's a once
in a generation case.

01:01:26.433 --> 01:01:27.924
Yeah, and we're
the next generation.

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:40.687
Equal protection
applies to all persons.

01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:43.648
A class in which men and women
share full membership.

01:01:43.742 --> 01:01:46.450
A divorced man counts
the same as a widower.

01:01:46.536 --> 01:01:48.869
You're saying that this guy
could have married his nurse,

01:01:48.955 --> 01:01:50.162
got divorced the next day,

01:01:50.248 --> 01:01:52.101
and then he'd be eligible
for the tax deduction?

01:01:52.125 --> 01:01:53.332
That's totally nuts.

01:01:53.627 --> 01:01:57.120
All right. Our client is a man.
We cannot lose sight of that,

01:01:57.214 --> 01:02:00.423
because men are also harmed
by the stereotype.

01:02:00.508 --> 01:02:03.000
That little boys are told
they can't be nurses.

01:02:03.094 --> 01:02:04.255
They can't be teachers.

01:02:04.346 --> 01:02:06.906
- They can't be secretaries.
- Or cook dinner for their families.

01:02:07.182 --> 01:02:09.048
Exactly. We're counting
on you, too.

01:02:09.142 --> 01:02:13.762
Wholly irrational distinction
between single sons and daughters.

01:02:15.315 --> 01:02:17.432
<i>Any taxpayer
may have an invalid parent...</i>

01:02:17.525 --> 01:02:19.587
...<i>may have an ailing parent.
Even an unmarried man.</i>

01:02:19.611 --> 01:02:22.024
...<i>unalterable
biological traits of birth</i>

01:02:22.113 --> 01:02:23.174
<i>over which the
individual has no...</i>

01:02:23.198 --> 01:02:24.759
<i>The principle
of American democracy</i>

01:02:24.783 --> 01:02:26.052
<i>should apply to
men and women equally.</i>

01:02:26.076 --> 01:02:29.820
...<i>arbitrary and unequal treatment
described by the Constitution.</i>

01:02:29.913 --> 01:02:32.633
<i>The law shouldn't reward
or penalize taxpayers for their sex.</i>

01:02:44.886 --> 01:02:49.677
Section 214 draws a line
solely on the basis of sex.

01:03:02.779 --> 01:03:05.692
Professor Ginsburg,
I finished typing the brief.

01:03:07.117 --> 01:03:08.904
You're a saint, Millicent.

01:03:10.787 --> 01:03:12.369
May I make
an observation?

01:03:13.415 --> 01:03:14.415
It's just...

01:03:15.208 --> 01:03:19.043
When I was typing it up,
jumping out all over the brief was...

01:03:19.879 --> 01:03:20.915
Well...

01:03:21.798 --> 01:03:22.834
"Sex."

01:03:23.258 --> 01:03:26.217
- Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex.
- Oh!

01:03:26.636 --> 01:03:29.549
- Oh.
- It reeks of hormones and backseats.

01:03:29.639 --> 01:03:31.801
And you know how men are.

01:03:33.768 --> 01:03:35.680
Maybe you should try
a less distracting word.

01:03:36.521 --> 01:03:38.763
Maybe "gender."

01:03:42.444 --> 01:03:44.686
- You realize that means...
- That's no problem.

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:46.737
I'm happy to type it again.

01:03:47.699 --> 01:03:48.735
Thanks.

01:03:49.951 --> 01:03:51.533
<i>Guessing doesn't
do us any good.</i>

01:03:51.619 --> 01:03:54.099
I need to know how many people were
turned away from the polls.

01:03:54.164 --> 01:03:56.004
Yeah, the affiliate still
hasn't sent the list.

01:03:56.666 --> 01:04:00.205
Then call Brian Tanner.
Remind him that we're on the same team.

01:04:00.295 --> 01:04:01.772
Tell him if he doesn't
start acting like it,

01:04:01.796 --> 01:04:04.436
I'm gonna fly to Wisconsin and
personally rip his throat out myself.

01:04:06.051 --> 01:04:09.840
Melvin. Didn't your mother ever
teach you to clean your room?

01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:13.426
Miss Kenyon.

01:04:15.185 --> 01:04:17.142
Time for your annual
dusting off already?

01:04:19.522 --> 01:04:23.232
In 1776, Abigail Adams
wrote her husband a letter.

01:04:24.027 --> 01:04:26.861
"As you write this new
constitution," she said,

01:04:27.405 --> 01:04:28.612
"remember the ladies."

01:04:29.115 --> 01:04:31.027
You know what that bastard
went ahead and did?

01:04:31.117 --> 01:04:32.153
Well, I can guess.

01:04:40.377 --> 01:04:42.835
<i>Idaho Statesman.</i>
You need a hobby.

01:04:43.671 --> 01:04:47.585
These poor people.
Sally and Cecil Reed. Divorced.

01:04:48.093 --> 01:04:49.800
Their son committed suicide.

01:04:49.886 --> 01:04:52.048
Both parents want to
administer his estate.

01:04:52.764 --> 01:04:54.255
In Idaho, the law says

01:04:54.349 --> 01:04:58.263
in this situation males must be
preferred to females.

01:04:58.728 --> 01:05:01.846
Why? 'Cause men
are better at math.

01:05:02.774 --> 01:05:04.766
And the Idaho Supreme Court

01:05:04.859 --> 01:05:07.192
just said that
is perfectly legal.

01:05:07.278 --> 01:05:10.396
Dorothy, I got student
protesters in jail in California.

01:05:10.490 --> 01:05:12.927
I got schools in Mississippi
that still refuse to desegregate. I...

01:05:12.951 --> 01:05:14.032
You're a sissy.

01:05:14.411 --> 01:05:17.700
The Board threatened to can you because
you stood up for draft dodgers.

01:05:17.789 --> 01:05:19.767
And you've had your tail
between your legs ever since.

01:05:19.791 --> 01:05:20.872
That is not...

01:05:22.168 --> 01:05:24.581
We don't have the resources
to take this on.

01:05:24.671 --> 01:05:26.958
I've seen you stand up
to the might of government

01:05:27.048 --> 01:05:29.882
with sling and stone
for what you know to be right.

01:05:29.968 --> 01:05:31.584
And kid,
I loved you for it.

01:05:32.303 --> 01:05:33.885
They're not gonna
fire you, Mel.

01:05:34.264 --> 01:05:35.784
The Board's a bunch
of tired old fools.

01:05:35.849 --> 01:05:37.465
They don't have
the nerve to do it.

01:05:38.601 --> 01:05:40.593
I should know.
I'm one of 'em.

01:05:44.983 --> 01:05:47.066
John Adams forgot the ladies.

01:05:48.278 --> 01:05:51.021
And it's time the ACLU
got back in the fight.

01:05:54.325 --> 01:05:56.112
- Okay.
- Good.

01:05:56.202 --> 01:05:57.568
Now, here's where you start.

01:05:57.996 --> 01:05:59.953
It's a case headed
to the Tenth Circuit.

01:06:00.039 --> 01:06:01.405
It's a professor
out of Rutgers.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.161
Smart cookie.

01:06:06.045 --> 01:06:07.581
Ruth.

01:06:08.381 --> 01:06:10.839
But nowhere does
the Constitution say

01:06:10.925 --> 01:06:13.759
the federal government
must treat people equally.

01:06:15.138 --> 01:06:17.926
What do the courts say
about that, Mrs. Parker?

01:06:18.850 --> 01:06:21.308
That the due process
clause implies

01:06:21.394 --> 01:06:24.011
that equal protection applies to
the federal government as well.

01:06:24.355 --> 01:06:26.938
- Can you cite the case?
<i>- Bolling v. Sharpe.</i>

01:06:28.276 --> 01:06:29.983
347 U.S. 497.

01:06:30.653 --> 01:06:34.021
Decided in conjunction
with <i>Brown v. Board of Education,</i> 1954.

01:06:34.491 --> 01:06:37.108
Bolling desegregated
all Washington, D.C.'s public schools.

01:06:37.619 --> 01:06:40.077
Chief Justice Warren,
writing for the court.

01:06:42.665 --> 01:06:44.201
How about it, teach?
Do I get an A?

01:06:48.129 --> 01:06:50.746
Well played, sending that
newspaper and the brief to Kenyon.

01:06:52.592 --> 01:06:54.083
I thought she might
have advice.

01:06:55.345 --> 01:06:57.428
Cut the shit. Don't ever
do that to me again.

01:06:57.514 --> 01:06:58.714
What do you think
of the brief?

01:07:00.683 --> 01:07:03.926
It's a compelling argument.
Brilliantly reasoned.

01:07:04.103 --> 01:07:06.220
More women than
ever are working now. And why not?

01:07:06.314 --> 01:07:08.852
We have preschools.
We have washing machines.

01:07:08.942 --> 01:07:10.942
- Cheap contraceptives.
- Yeah, times have changed.

01:07:11.528 --> 01:07:12.985
There's a glaring
problem, though.

01:07:14.113 --> 01:07:16.355
In the unlikely event that
you actually win this thing,

01:07:17.033 --> 01:07:18.240
what's the remedy?

01:07:18.952 --> 01:07:21.444
The court takes away the caregiver
deduction for everybody,

01:07:21.538 --> 01:07:22.904
including working mothers?

01:07:22.997 --> 01:07:25.159
- Then you've done more harm than good.
- No.

01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:26.957
Do you remember
Justice Harlan's opinion

01:07:27.043 --> 01:07:29.285
last June in
<i>Welsh v. United States?</i>

01:07:30.421 --> 01:07:31.421
Yeah.

01:07:32.423 --> 01:07:34.068
He said laws could be
extended when doing so

01:07:34.092 --> 01:07:36.737
would be closer to the legislature's
intent than overturning would be.

01:07:36.761 --> 01:07:38.673
We're adding
one more section to the brief,

01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:41.467
urging the court
to extend the law

01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:44.717
to include Charlie
as well as everyone else.

01:07:47.188 --> 01:07:48.269
All right.

01:07:49.732 --> 01:07:52.224
The ACLU is prepared to
put their name on your brief.

01:07:53.695 --> 01:07:55.778
- We appreciate your support.
- Stop.

01:07:56.281 --> 01:07:58.842
I still say I'd rather be a woman
in this country than a black man,

01:07:58.866 --> 01:08:02.109
or a Socialist
or a religious minority.

01:08:03.788 --> 01:08:06.496
Now, let's talk about you
taking on <i>Reed v. Reed.</i>

01:08:06.583 --> 01:08:07.915
Oh, stop. No.

01:08:08.418 --> 01:08:11.286
All men in Idaho
are better at math?

01:08:11.379 --> 01:08:13.792
Ruth, I gave you one case.
That's all you get.

01:08:13.881 --> 01:08:17.045
The Moritz argument works just
as well for a female client.

01:08:18.094 --> 01:08:20.381
And <i>Reed's</i> a state
Supreme Court case

01:08:20.470 --> 01:08:23.464
which means the U.S. Supreme
Court must hear the appeal.

01:08:23.558 --> 01:08:25.890
I told you, I don't want
another 50-year battle.

01:08:27.185 --> 01:08:29.178
Call Sally Reed's lawyer, Mel.

01:08:29.272 --> 01:08:31.764
If I were you, I would
worry about my own case.

01:08:32.066 --> 01:08:35.087
And I expect to see your remedy arguments
before they go to the Tenth Circuit.

01:08:35.111 --> 01:08:37.569
And I want to be there when you
practice your oral arguments.

01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:39.981
We're doing a moot court.

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:43.613
No. It's non-negotiable.

01:08:45.162 --> 01:08:46.198
When?

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:48.960
As soon as we get the
government's response brief.

01:08:51.169 --> 01:08:53.089
Where did these
people go to law school?

01:08:54.671 --> 01:08:57.460
You can't make a constitutional
challenge to the tax laws, can you?

01:08:57.925 --> 01:09:00.042
And who's ever heard of
gender discrimination?

01:09:00.136 --> 01:09:01.136
It's a stretch.

01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:03.340
These folks are running at
hell with a bucket of water.

01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:05.013
Case law's filled
with challenges

01:09:05.099 --> 01:09:06.260
that could not be made

01:09:06.975 --> 01:09:08.183
till they were.

01:09:08.978 --> 01:09:11.140
I'm putting Murphy
on writing our response brief.

01:09:11.229 --> 01:09:14.268
- With due respect, Mr. Brown...
- It's not personal, Bozarth.

01:09:14.359 --> 01:09:17.443
But if we're not careful,
this appeal could cast

01:09:18.029 --> 01:09:20.863
a cloud of unconstitutionality
over every federal law

01:09:20.948 --> 01:09:22.859
that differentiates
between men and women.

01:09:23.910 --> 01:09:26.448
I need someone more
seasoned on this.

01:09:28.038 --> 01:09:29.879
Could you get me
the Solicitor General, please?

01:09:30.124 --> 01:09:32.241
I pulled the file.
I deserve the chance.

01:09:32.502 --> 01:09:33.912
Murphy's a weak sister.

01:09:34.629 --> 01:09:36.586
I know how to win
this case, sir.

01:09:37.423 --> 01:09:39.005
Better than Murphy.
Better than anyone.

01:09:40.218 --> 01:09:41.754
You need me on this appeal.

01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:43.631
This is Brown.

01:09:45.264 --> 01:09:46.380
I need to see him.

01:09:50.019 --> 01:09:51.975
Okay. Tell me.

01:09:53.022 --> 01:09:55.264
Gender equality
is a civil right?

01:09:55.358 --> 01:09:58.146
When everyone's aggrieved
and everyone's a victim.

01:09:58.236 --> 01:09:59.693
It's what the ACLU does.

01:09:59.779 --> 01:10:03.113
Divide the country into smaller
and smaller subgroups.

01:10:03.241 --> 01:10:06.154
- Ginsburg. Cancer, right?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:10:06.244 --> 01:10:09.032
- And the wife, very demanding.
- But smart.

01:10:10.206 --> 01:10:11.367
Ten years.

01:10:12.083 --> 01:10:15.326
Ten years I fought to enroll
women at Harvard Law.

01:10:16.796 --> 01:10:19.789
The faculty, the university,
my wife warned me against it.

01:10:20.133 --> 01:10:23.217
Now I'm Solicitor General,
it comes back to haunt me.

01:10:23.636 --> 01:10:25.798
Erwin, we could settle.

01:10:26.514 --> 01:10:28.847
Martin Ginsburg was
one of my best students.

01:10:28.933 --> 01:10:30.049
A practical young man.

01:10:30.143 --> 01:10:33.181
We can call him and tell him
we'll give the man his money.

01:10:33.271 --> 01:10:34.352
Go our separate ways.

01:10:34.439 --> 01:10:35.850
No. No.

01:10:36.399 --> 01:10:38.391
We settle now,
it's open season.

01:10:38.943 --> 01:10:42.983
Let's put this idea of gender discrimination
to bed once and for all.

01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:45.356
They handed us
a winnable case.

01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:46.816
And we'll win it.

01:10:48.703 --> 01:10:49.864
You think he's up to it?

01:10:50.496 --> 01:10:52.658
Oh, Mr. Bozarth
is a fine litigator.

01:10:52.749 --> 01:10:55.457
- Tell him your idea.
- We list the laws.

01:10:56.502 --> 01:10:58.243
- What laws?
- All of 'em.

01:11:00.173 --> 01:11:02.460
Every federal law that treats
men and women differently.

01:11:02.550 --> 01:11:03.666
We show the court exactly

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:05.680
what can of worms these
folks are trying to open.

01:11:05.762 --> 01:11:06.798
Son...

01:11:06.888 --> 01:11:11.508
The last anyone checked,
the U.S. Code was 20,000 pages long.

01:11:11.601 --> 01:11:14.685
- Who's gonna read it? You?
- I can get it done, sir.

01:11:15.772 --> 01:11:17.104
I just need an introduction.

01:11:18.483 --> 01:11:20.600
- To whom?
- The Secretary of Defense.

01:11:45.176 --> 01:11:47.776
These computers will
find what we're looking for?

01:11:47.804 --> 01:11:49.796
Yes, sir.
In just a few days.

01:11:50.223 --> 01:11:53.842
Without any human beings
actually reading the laws.

01:11:57.688 --> 01:11:59.475
What a horrifying age.

01:12:02.985 --> 01:12:04.192
Ruth Bader Ginsburg?

01:12:05.279 --> 01:12:06.895
Delivery from
the Department of Justice.

01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:08.821
Oh.

01:12:08.908 --> 01:12:10.774
Could someone
pass me Title 33?

01:12:11.536 --> 01:12:12.536
Get this.

01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:16.614
There's a law that we're not allowed
to fly military cargo planes.

01:12:17.333 --> 01:12:19.620
It says here that we're not
allowed to work in mines.

01:12:19.710 --> 01:12:21.042
Why would you want to?

01:12:21.128 --> 01:12:23.165
Well, that's not the point.
We should be allowed.

01:12:24.382 --> 01:12:26.294
You really think
you can change all those laws?

01:12:26.551 --> 01:12:29.589
- Kiki! Curtain's up in 45 minutes.
- That's the plan.

01:12:29.804 --> 01:12:32.604
Might be a novel experience to get
there before it starts for a change.

01:12:33.182 --> 01:12:36.516
Please tell me that
you are dressed.

01:12:37.311 --> 01:12:40.349
- Hi. What are you doing?
- The government's brief came.

01:12:41.691 --> 01:12:44.308
And look who else is on it.

01:12:47.738 --> 01:12:50.606
I knew Griswold was trying
to get Brown over to the DOJ.

01:12:51.325 --> 01:12:52.611
It looks like that worked.

01:12:52.785 --> 01:12:55.027
- How's it look?
- Check out Appendix E.

01:12:56.330 --> 01:12:59.289
It's every federal law
that discriminates on the basis of sex.

01:12:59.375 --> 01:13:02.209
We're looking them all up.
There must be hundreds.

01:13:04.505 --> 01:13:05.962
Good God!

01:13:06.048 --> 01:13:07.129
Hmm.

01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:10.088
You're convinced
Daugherty will see it our way?

01:13:11.137 --> 01:13:14.130
Well, based on reading
all of his opinions, yes.

01:13:14.223 --> 01:13:15.509
And so will Holloway.

01:13:17.310 --> 01:13:20.303
But the final judge, Doyle...

01:13:21.647 --> 01:13:23.559
Well, he's gonna be
a tougher nut to crack.

01:13:23.649 --> 01:13:24.810
That's unacceptable.

01:13:24.901 --> 01:13:27.985
We need a unanimous decision
out of the Tenth Circuit, James.

01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:30.733
We don't want so-called
gender discrimination

01:13:30.823 --> 01:13:32.564
finding its way
to the Supreme Court.

01:13:32.658 --> 01:13:34.069
Yes, sir.
I understand that.

01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:35.992
What makes this judge
so difficult?

01:13:36.245 --> 01:13:38.658
Well, ma'am,
he's a civil rights crusader.

01:13:39.165 --> 01:13:43.705
Two years ago, he ordered Denver to start
bussing black students to white schools.

01:13:43.794 --> 01:13:47.458
There were protests, arson,
demands for him to quit the bench.

01:13:47.548 --> 01:13:50.165
But even after someone
threw a bomb at his house,

01:13:50.676 --> 01:13:51.883
Doyle wouldn't budge.

01:13:51.969 --> 01:13:54.336
In that case,
he was enforcing the law.

01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:57.218
The Ginsburgs are
asking him to make law.

01:13:57.767 --> 01:13:59.679
We need to drive home
the difference.

01:13:59.769 --> 01:14:03.854
Paint the judges a picture
of the America that will exist

01:14:04.190 --> 01:14:05.726
if they rule the wrong way.

01:14:05.816 --> 01:14:09.526
Children running home from
school to find no one's there.

01:14:10.029 --> 01:14:11.486
Mommy's at the office

01:14:11.572 --> 01:14:12.983
or on a factory floor.

01:14:13.074 --> 01:14:16.909
A man and a woman vie for the same job,
she can work for less.

01:14:17.912 --> 01:14:21.201
What is a man without a paycheck
to take care of his family?

01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:22.935
What woman would want him?

01:14:22.959 --> 01:14:26.123
Wages would go down.
Divorce rates would soar.

01:14:26.212 --> 01:14:29.171
The very fabric of our society
would begin to unravel.

01:14:29.256 --> 01:14:31.122
Exactly. The other side
wants this to be

01:14:31.217 --> 01:14:34.005
about the equal
protection principle.

01:14:34.095 --> 01:14:36.257
The judges are deciding
what kind of country,

01:14:36.347 --> 01:14:37.838
what kind of society

01:14:37.932 --> 01:14:40.265
they want their children and
grandchildren to grow up in.

01:14:40.351 --> 01:14:43.059
You make sure the court sees

01:14:43.145 --> 01:14:44.511
what's at stake

01:14:44.605 --> 01:14:46.597
is the American family.

01:14:48.109 --> 01:14:49.941
Whoa! Cool!

01:14:53.656 --> 01:14:55.898
Mom, can I be on the jury?

01:14:55.992 --> 01:14:58.405
No, there is no jury
in federal appeals court.

01:14:58.494 --> 01:15:01.783
No witnesses, no evidence,
just you and the judges.

01:15:03.457 --> 01:15:04.914
- Gerry!
- Hello.

01:15:05.001 --> 01:15:06.492
- Hello.
- How are you?

01:15:06.585 --> 01:15:08.497
- You remember Jane?
- Hi.

01:15:08.587 --> 01:15:11.375
Jane, my old professor,
Gerald Gunther.

01:15:11.465 --> 01:15:12.626
Come on in.

01:15:13.718 --> 01:15:16.210
Look at you. All grown up!

01:15:18.014 --> 01:15:20.256
- Hello, James.
- Hi.

01:15:20.349 --> 01:15:22.136
What do you think
of our courtroom?

01:15:22.476 --> 01:15:25.765
Ah, well, all that's missing
is Justice holding her scales.

01:15:26.147 --> 01:15:29.811
So, who did Mel find
to be the third judge?

01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:31.107
Pauli Murray.

01:15:31.235 --> 01:15:33.714
- So he's not making it easy for you, huh?
- Who's Pauli Murray?

01:15:33.738 --> 01:15:36.321
Thurgood Marshall himself
called Pauli's writings

01:15:36.407 --> 01:15:38.364
the Bible of
the civil rights movement.

01:15:38.451 --> 01:15:40.488
Gerry, I come
bearing your gavel.

01:15:45.332 --> 01:15:48.325
Counsel for the appellant,
you may proceed.

01:15:49.587 --> 01:15:50.873
Again.

01:15:51.630 --> 01:15:52.630
Your Honors,

01:15:52.715 --> 01:15:53.956
and may it please
the court.

01:15:54.341 --> 01:15:56.879
Section 214
of the Tax Code

01:15:56.969 --> 01:16:00.212
covers employed single women
who care for their dependents.

01:16:00.306 --> 01:16:05.222
But excludes Charles Moritz,
a bachelor providing the same care.

01:16:05.311 --> 01:16:08.645
My wife stays home
to raise our children.

01:16:08.773 --> 01:16:11.140
- Are you saying she's oppressed?
- No, Judge.

01:16:11.275 --> 01:16:13.983
- But as a man, you may not...
- No, no, no. Stop. Stop. Stop.

01:16:14.070 --> 01:16:15.436
Never make it about the judge.

01:16:15.613 --> 01:16:18.151
You don't think
the judge knows he's a man?

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:20.385
No. I don't want to put him
on the defensive about it, though.

01:16:20.409 --> 01:16:22.321
In <i>Brown,</i> we put it out
there without apology.

01:16:22.411 --> 01:16:23.947
This is wrong.

01:16:24.038 --> 01:16:27.452
Yeah, no offense. But Ruth doesn't
exactly have Thurgood Marshall's, uh...

01:16:29.668 --> 01:16:31.751
- Balls?
- Gravitas.

01:16:32.088 --> 01:16:33.624
Should I...
Should I start again?

01:16:33.714 --> 01:16:35.376
Unless you think you won
the case already.

01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:38.070
Whenever you're ready.

01:16:38.094 --> 01:16:39.694
Your Honors,
and may it please the court.

01:16:39.762 --> 01:16:41.424
Section 214 of the Tax Code

01:16:41.597 --> 01:16:44.180
covers employed single women
who care for their dependents.

01:16:44.266 --> 01:16:48.681
But excludes Charles Moritz,
a bachelor providing the same care.

01:16:48.979 --> 01:16:51.642
There is no rational basis...

01:16:51.732 --> 01:16:53.189
Why is it not rational?

01:16:53.484 --> 01:16:55.942
Men go out. Women stay home.

01:16:56.028 --> 01:16:58.028
It's been the way of things
for thousands of years.

01:16:58.072 --> 01:17:00.155
Historical justification
was also used

01:17:00.241 --> 01:17:03.279
to legitimize
the separation of the races.

01:17:03.369 --> 01:17:05.281
- Now, classification can be...
- Are you saying

01:17:05.371 --> 01:17:07.033
race and gender
are the same?

01:17:10.626 --> 01:17:15.246
Both are unalterable
biological traits.

01:17:15.339 --> 01:17:19.583
This nation struggles to give
blacks fair representation throughout society.

01:17:20.094 --> 01:17:23.963
And you're saying tha
if we decide in your client's favor,

01:17:24.056 --> 01:17:27.174
we're committing ourselves
to moving towards half of our, I don't know,

01:17:27.268 --> 01:17:30.887
firemen being women?
Half our nurses being men?

01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:32.437
But why shouldn't men
be nurses?

01:17:32.565 --> 01:17:35.273
- And if women want to fight fires...
- What about pilots?

01:17:35.359 --> 01:17:36.691
Yeah, again, if women choose

01:17:36.777 --> 01:17:38.234
- to take on these roles...
- Judges?

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:40.403
- Why not?
- CEOs? Generals?

01:17:40.573 --> 01:17:42.384
What about garbage men?
You want to be a garbage man?

01:17:42.408 --> 01:17:44.491
And if men
want to be teachers

01:17:44.577 --> 01:17:45.971
- or raise children...
- Oh, come on.

01:17:45.995 --> 01:17:47.281
Percentages aren't the point.

01:17:47.371 --> 01:17:48.515
- Wrong.
- People should be able to

01:17:48.539 --> 01:17:49.850
- pursue their passions.
- Wrong! Wrong!

01:17:49.874 --> 01:17:50.955
You're screwing
it up, Ruth!

01:17:51.041 --> 01:17:52.407
Have you read the appendix

01:17:52.501 --> 01:17:54.104
- attached to their brief?
- You're making the wrong case!

01:17:54.128 --> 01:17:57.292
These are laws written by men
who think we are privileged

01:17:57.381 --> 01:18:00.624
to be excused from men's obligations,
but it is not a privilege.

01:18:00.718 --> 01:18:03.836
It is a cage and these laws
are the bars!

01:18:11.145 --> 01:18:12.556
So that's it?

01:18:13.689 --> 01:18:15.976
You're gonna take them all on
at the same time?

01:18:21.739 --> 01:18:23.025
You asked the questions.

01:18:23.115 --> 01:18:25.435
Well, it doesn't mean you have
to fucking answer them, Ruth.

01:18:26.202 --> 01:18:28.239
You're making the
government's case for them!

01:18:28.329 --> 01:18:31.697
Look, you either make this case
about one man, or you lose!

01:18:32.374 --> 01:18:34.769
Because to the judges, you're not
talking about women in the abstract.

01:18:34.793 --> 01:18:37.786
You're talking about
their wives at home,

01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:39.542
you know, baking briskets.

01:18:39.632 --> 01:18:41.624
You braise a brisket.
You don't bake it.

01:18:42.801 --> 01:18:44.838
- Perhaps that's enough, Mel.
- No!

01:18:45.262 --> 01:18:47.049
I don't think it is, Gerry.

01:18:49.058 --> 01:18:50.924
Look, when you were a kid,

01:18:51.018 --> 01:18:53.510
you were pretty
and you were smart as a whip,

01:18:53.604 --> 01:18:55.804
but you're coming across
as this bitter, unlikable shrew

01:18:55.856 --> 01:18:56.976
that I don't even recognize.

01:18:57.066 --> 01:18:59.649
And if that's who shows up
in Denver, you will blow it.

01:19:00.027 --> 01:19:02.144
And would it kill you
to smile?

01:19:03.447 --> 01:19:05.029
That's your advice?

01:19:06.158 --> 01:19:09.026
Just ignore the judges
and smile.

01:19:10.412 --> 01:19:12.199
Pâté's the best
I've ever tasted.

01:19:15.251 --> 01:19:16.617
You could evade.

01:19:16.710 --> 01:19:18.372
Should women
be firefighters?

01:19:18.462 --> 01:19:20.357
"With all due respect,
Your Honor, I haven't considered it

01:19:20.381 --> 01:19:22.418
"because my client
isn't a firefighter."

01:19:22.633 --> 01:19:24.169
Or you can redirect.

01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:27.344
"With respect, Judge, this case
is not about firefighters.

01:19:27.429 --> 01:19:28.510
"It's about taxpayers

01:19:28.597 --> 01:19:31.840
"and there's nothing inherently masculine
about paying taxes."

01:19:32.226 --> 01:19:33.387
Crack a joke.

01:19:33.477 --> 01:19:35.264
"Your Honor, anyone
who's raised a child

01:19:35.354 --> 01:19:36.634
"couldn't possibly
be intimidated

01:19:36.689 --> 01:19:37.930
"by a burning building."

01:19:38.065 --> 01:19:40.145
And then bring them back to your case.

01:19:40.192 --> 01:19:41.979
Marty, you should do
the oral arguments.

01:19:43.279 --> 01:19:45.862
No, no, no.
Ruth is the expert on gender law.

01:19:45.948 --> 01:19:47.735
At least half this case
is tax.

01:19:47.825 --> 01:19:50.533
The most important thing
is that Charles Moritz wins.

01:19:50.619 --> 01:19:52.576
I said no, Mel. Drop it.

01:19:56.250 --> 01:19:57.582
They could split the time.

01:19:58.085 --> 01:20:00.919
Martin goes first,
focuses the argument on tax.

01:20:01.005 --> 01:20:03.588
Then Ruth steps in,
talks about gender.

01:20:09.388 --> 01:20:10.948
- Pauli, here you go.
- Thank you.

01:20:11.432 --> 01:20:13.048
- Gerry, this is yours.
- Mel. Mel.

01:20:13.726 --> 01:20:15.217
There is no aspect of law

01:20:15.311 --> 01:20:17.394
at which Ruth Ginsburg
can be bested.

01:20:17.479 --> 01:20:19.311
I don't know
how things work at the ACLU,

01:20:19.398 --> 01:20:21.793
but if anyone at my firm couldn't see that,
they would be fired.

01:20:21.817 --> 01:20:24.355
Objection noted, Counselor.
She's still arguing half.

01:20:24.570 --> 01:20:25.686
- This is her...
- Listen,

01:20:25.779 --> 01:20:27.215
she's written
a revolutionary argument,

01:20:27.239 --> 01:20:29.777
but brief writing
is an academic's job. Okay?

01:20:30.492 --> 01:20:34.076
Oral arguments require a lawyer
who can command a judge's respect.

01:20:34.163 --> 01:20:36.155
A real appellate lawyer.

01:20:37.458 --> 01:20:38.949
What a team
you're gonna be.

01:20:39.043 --> 01:20:40.579
It was a good experience.

01:20:40.794 --> 01:20:42.660
I think that was
a very productive exercise.

01:20:42.755 --> 01:20:43.962
I have to go to a fundraiser.

01:20:44.048 --> 01:20:45.859
Pauli, Gerry, you want to split
a cab downtown?

01:20:45.883 --> 01:20:47.499
- Sure.
- Sure.

01:20:50.512 --> 01:20:51.512
Good team.

01:20:51.597 --> 01:20:53.283
Good to see you, Gerry.
Thank you for coming.

01:20:53.307 --> 01:20:55.515
- Bye-bye. Good seeing you.
- Great to see you.

01:21:01.857 --> 01:21:03.018
Bye.

01:21:12.159 --> 01:21:14.492
You have such
a light touch. It...

01:21:15.329 --> 01:21:17.446
It's just effortless
for you, isn't it?

01:21:18.415 --> 01:21:20.623
Mel was goading you.

01:21:20.918 --> 01:21:22.598
He was trying
to make you feel overwhelmed.

01:21:22.669 --> 01:21:25.377
Of course he was.
He's a relentless prick.

01:21:26.090 --> 01:21:27.984
But it doesn't change the fact
that I'm not ready.

01:21:28.008 --> 01:21:29.903
It's not your fault.
You've never done this before.

01:21:29.927 --> 01:21:32.590
Is that what I'm supposed
to tell Charlie when I blow it in court?

01:21:37.476 --> 01:21:40.594
Do you want <i>Theories
in Public Taxation</i> with you in Denver?

01:21:40.687 --> 01:21:43.100
Who needs a tax reference when you have Marty?

01:21:44.316 --> 01:21:47.024
Did you pack the, uh,
<i>Kirk v. Commissioner</i> brief?

01:21:47.111 --> 01:21:48.352
Yes.

01:21:48.904 --> 01:21:50.270
Rutgers Law.

01:21:51.073 --> 01:21:52.439
It's Mel Wulf for you.

01:21:54.118 --> 01:21:55.654
Just tell him I'm not here.

01:21:56.161 --> 01:21:57.493
I'm sorry, Mr...

01:21:58.622 --> 01:22:00.158
He says it's urgent.

01:22:09.383 --> 01:22:11.215
- Yeah...
- What was so important?

01:22:11.927 --> 01:22:13.884
I'm excited to work with you.

01:22:14.346 --> 01:22:15.346
Yeah.

01:22:15.431 --> 01:22:16.763
I understand.

01:22:17.391 --> 01:22:18.632
She just walked in.

01:22:19.977 --> 01:22:21.138
And to you too.

01:22:22.479 --> 01:22:23.640
Okay.

01:22:23.981 --> 01:22:25.722
Ruth Ginsburg.
Allen Derr.

01:22:25.816 --> 01:22:27.023
How do you do?

01:22:27.860 --> 01:22:29.963
The Supreme Court just announced
they're gonna hear <i>Reed v. Reed</i>

01:22:29.987 --> 01:22:32.070
on appeal from
the Idaho Supreme Court.

01:22:32.739 --> 01:22:34.321
That's fantastic.

01:22:34.408 --> 01:22:36.650
Mrs. Reed is very excited
for the opportunity.

01:22:36.743 --> 01:22:38.575
Allen is
Sally Reed's lawyer.

01:22:39.413 --> 01:22:42.247
So, is the ACLU gonna help?

01:22:42.332 --> 01:22:44.212
You told me it was
the right thing to do, right?

01:22:44.293 --> 01:22:47.081
Mel says that no one knows this
area of the law better than you.

01:22:47.171 --> 01:22:48.628
You're our
secret weapon, Ruth.

01:22:48.881 --> 01:22:49.917
So...

01:22:50.966 --> 01:22:54.209
You want me
in the Supreme Court?

01:22:55.679 --> 01:22:56.886
I, uh...

01:22:57.306 --> 01:22:58.306
Uh...

01:22:58.849 --> 01:23:01.592
I told Allen you'd be eager
to help him write his brief.

01:23:06.273 --> 01:23:07.514
Oh.

01:23:08.108 --> 01:23:09.586
Well, you'd basically take
the Moritz brief

01:23:09.610 --> 01:23:11.567
and swap around the pronouns.
Isn't that right?

01:23:11.653 --> 01:23:13.610
It's a little more
involved than that.

01:23:13.697 --> 01:23:14.938
Joking.

01:23:15.032 --> 01:23:16.819
All right, let's start
right away.

01:23:17.326 --> 01:23:20.285
Allen, uh, enjoy the city.
You should catch a show while you're here.

01:23:20.370 --> 01:23:22.532
- Ah, well, thank you.
- Yeah.

01:23:22.706 --> 01:23:23.787
Yeah.

01:23:24.833 --> 01:23:27.325
Oh, uh, Kiki and I
have some stuff to discuss.

01:23:28.962 --> 01:23:31.204
Yes, of course,
I'll get out of your way.

01:23:31.423 --> 01:23:34.086
It was a pleasure meeting you,
Ruth or Kiki.

01:23:34.176 --> 01:23:35.176
Uh...

01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:36.421
Mel.

01:23:36.929 --> 01:23:38.136
Oh! Oh.

01:23:38.722 --> 01:23:41.510
- Ah. Don't forget that.
- Mustn't forget that, yeah.

01:23:43.602 --> 01:23:44.763
What a schmuck.

01:23:44.853 --> 01:23:48.062
- Let me argue <i>Reed</i> in court.
- Oh, give me a break.

01:23:48.148 --> 01:23:50.515
I am no less experienced
than Allen Derr in federal court.

01:23:50.651 --> 01:23:52.629
- You have zero experience.
- If you're gonna use my argument...

01:23:52.653 --> 01:23:54.453
He's been Sally Reed's lawyer
for three years.

01:23:54.530 --> 01:23:55.530
She trusts him.

01:23:55.864 --> 01:23:57.424
She wouldn't even
let me argue the case.

01:23:57.491 --> 01:24:00.011
Now, listen to me for a second.
We have someone else to discuss.

01:24:00.369 --> 01:24:02.110
Ernie Brown called
this morning.

01:24:02.538 --> 01:24:04.182
In light of <i>Reed</i> going
to the Supreme Court,

01:24:04.206 --> 01:24:06.566
the government wants to settle
the Moritz case for a dollar.

01:24:07.334 --> 01:24:10.668
<i>Reed</i> ups the profile of our case.
They're getting nervous.

01:24:10.879 --> 01:24:13.371
I told them you'd be in D.C.
on Monday to sign the paperwork.

01:24:16.343 --> 01:24:17.754
Why would you say that?

01:24:18.178 --> 01:24:20.886
- Charlie won't want to settle.
- No, convince him.

01:24:21.765 --> 01:24:23.427
I will not.

01:24:23.850 --> 01:24:26.558
First you took half the argument
away from me...

01:24:26.645 --> 01:24:29.479
Nobody took anything
away from you, Ruth.

01:24:29.565 --> 01:24:31.584
You weren't robbed
in the middle of the night. All right?

01:24:31.608 --> 01:24:33.920
I was giving you this opportunity
for the good of the cause.

01:24:33.944 --> 01:24:35.901
- You gave this to me?
- In fact, I did.

01:24:36.029 --> 01:24:38.316
- And get your emotions in check.
- You first.

01:24:40.617 --> 01:24:43.109
Allen is going to be arguing
in the Supreme Court

01:24:43.203 --> 01:24:44.614
that times have changed.

01:24:45.330 --> 01:24:47.743
We can't afford the Tenth Circuit
saying that they haven't.

01:24:47.833 --> 01:24:49.825
Nothing would strengthen
the argument more

01:24:49.918 --> 01:24:52.001
than the appeals court
deciding for Charlie.

01:24:52.087 --> 01:24:54.023
Yes, that would be very nice,
but here in the real world,

01:24:54.047 --> 01:24:55.900
- with working lawyers...
- You think I can't be persuasive?

01:24:55.924 --> 01:24:58.444
Oh, I've never been more certain
about anything in my life, Ruth.

01:24:59.386 --> 01:25:01.002
You don't get to tell me
when to quit.

01:25:01.096 --> 01:25:02.837
You couldn't even make it
through moot court

01:25:02.931 --> 01:25:04.422
without embarrassing yourself.

01:25:05.642 --> 01:25:07.679
You will lose, Ruth.

01:25:07.769 --> 01:25:10.512
And when you do, you will set the
women's movement back 10 years.

01:25:10.606 --> 01:25:13.269
More! We are dodging
a bullet here.

01:25:14.401 --> 01:25:16.313
Are you the only one
that can't see that?

01:25:28.582 --> 01:25:30.582
These are Allen's briefs
from the previous appeals.

01:25:31.084 --> 01:25:33.292
Tie them into the framework
of the Moritz brief.

01:25:33.879 --> 01:25:35.370
I'll review it
when you're done.

01:25:38.592 --> 01:25:40.709
It's a Supreme Court brief.

01:25:42.638 --> 01:25:45.221
I can assign it to someone else
if that's what you'd prefer.

01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:02.397
Oh, and... And Ruth, uh,

01:26:02.491 --> 01:26:04.153
sooner you call Charlie,
the better.

01:26:16.421 --> 01:26:17.753
<i>I had this idea.</i>

01:26:18.382 --> 01:26:19.498
What's that?

01:26:20.175 --> 01:26:21.632
Well, it doesn't matter now.

01:26:22.469 --> 01:26:23.505
Tell me.

01:26:25.764 --> 01:26:28.552
We could have taken Appendix E
from the government's brief,

01:26:28.642 --> 01:26:32.261
that entire
comprehensive list of laws

01:26:32.813 --> 01:26:37.353
that differentiates between the sexes,
and... and turn it into our own hit list.

01:26:38.068 --> 01:26:40.856
We could have started
a special project at the ACLU

01:26:40.946 --> 01:26:44.360
to go after those laws one by one
in the legislature, in the courts,

01:26:44.449 --> 01:26:48.159
until women and men were
genuinely equal under the law.

01:26:50.914 --> 01:26:53.702
And I've been running around
claiming things have changed.

01:27:38.211 --> 01:27:39.793
Daddy told me
about the case.

01:27:43.467 --> 01:27:45.550
Why is Mel Wulf
being such a dick?

01:27:49.389 --> 01:27:52.973
- He thinks I'm going to lose.
- No way, Jose. Not in my experience.

01:28:01.401 --> 01:28:03.688
As Mr. Moritz's lawyer, I'm...

01:28:05.363 --> 01:28:07.776
I'm ethically bound
to convey him the offer.

01:28:11.953 --> 01:28:16.072
So, would you like help taking
apart your life's work or

01:28:17.626 --> 01:28:19.663
is that something
you'd rather do by yourself?

01:28:21.922 --> 01:28:23.083
I...

01:28:23.799 --> 01:28:25.791
I know that this case...

01:28:30.931 --> 01:28:33.548
That I disrupted
our lives and...

01:28:37.312 --> 01:28:38.598
I'm sorry.

01:28:39.064 --> 01:28:41.932
Sorry for what? For...
For doing your job?

01:28:48.281 --> 01:28:49.442
Who's it for,

01:28:51.409 --> 01:28:52.570
if not for me?

01:28:58.041 --> 01:28:59.310
<i>And they'll say it, right?</i>

01:28:59.334 --> 01:29:01.542
<i>That I'm not a cheater,
that the law's unfair?</i>

01:29:01.628 --> 01:29:02.869
No, Charlie,

01:29:03.004 --> 01:29:05.496
the government
won't say that on its own.

01:29:05.590 --> 01:29:07.877
<i>But if they don't say it,
how will I have won?</i>

01:29:10.136 --> 01:29:11.593
You... You haven't.

01:29:13.348 --> 01:29:14.964
But you... you get the money.

01:29:18.144 --> 01:29:19.851
What about everyone else?

01:29:20.522 --> 01:29:22.138
When you came to see me,

01:29:22.399 --> 01:29:24.982
- you said...
<i>- Charlie, the settlement is only for you.</i>

01:29:26.027 --> 01:29:27.563
<i>No one else can benefit.</i>

01:29:29.531 --> 01:29:30.817
But could we win?

01:29:31.199 --> 01:29:33.486
Well, we could, and...

01:29:34.870 --> 01:29:37.112
and the impact
would last generations.

01:29:39.624 --> 01:29:41.786
But the ACLU feels

01:29:42.294 --> 01:29:45.082
it's best
if you take the offer.

01:29:47.340 --> 01:29:48.797
But you're my lawyer, Ruth.

01:29:50.260 --> 01:29:51.626
<i>What do you think?</i>

01:29:59.728 --> 01:30:00.844
Ah, Ruth!

01:30:00.937 --> 01:30:02.803
- Professor Brown.
- Please, come in.

01:30:06.192 --> 01:30:07.478
Dean Griswold.

01:30:08.028 --> 01:30:09.439
Mrs. Ginsburg.

01:30:10.822 --> 01:30:13.815
I'm pleased you found a use
for your Harvard education.

01:30:14.618 --> 01:30:17.611
Actually, what I'm doing now,
I learned at Columbia.

01:30:19.873 --> 01:30:23.742
Ah, Ruth was always my most
thoroughly prepared student.

01:30:24.210 --> 01:30:25.746
So much to prove.

01:30:27.005 --> 01:30:29.998
These days the girls
are as hopeless as the men.

01:30:31.509 --> 01:30:32.920
How's little Jane?

01:30:33.470 --> 01:30:36.588
Not so little. And we have
another, James.

01:30:37.182 --> 01:30:39.765
- Mmm. I'm sure they keep you busy.
- Yes.

01:30:40.894 --> 01:30:42.010
Both of us.

01:30:43.980 --> 01:30:46.017
Ernie has
your paperwork ready.

01:30:49.945 --> 01:30:52.858
My client was very excited
about your offer.

01:30:53.073 --> 01:30:54.359
Good.

01:30:54.699 --> 01:30:55.780
Good.

01:30:55.867 --> 01:30:57.859
He did, however,
have some conditions.

01:30:58.244 --> 01:30:59.485
Conditions?

01:30:59.704 --> 01:31:01.240
What kind of conditions?

01:31:01.790 --> 01:31:05.409
First of all, he'd like you
to forgive 100% of the money.

01:31:05.502 --> 01:31:07.789
- None of this one dollar business.
- Yes, well...

01:31:07.879 --> 01:31:09.711
I'm sure we can manage
to arrange that.

01:31:10.048 --> 01:31:12.916
And he'd like the government
to concede that he did nothing wrong.

01:31:14.719 --> 01:31:16.756
And enter
into the court record

01:31:16.846 --> 01:31:18.963
that Section 214
of the Tax Code

01:31:19.057 --> 01:31:22.596
discriminates on the basis of sex
and is therefore unconstitutional.

01:31:24.479 --> 01:31:27.688
I can't agree to that.
And you know it.

01:31:28.024 --> 01:31:29.731
Does Mel Wulf
know about this?

01:31:33.655 --> 01:31:35.817
Mmm. Then we'll
see you in court.

01:31:46.918 --> 01:31:48.204
Thank you, gentlemen.

01:31:49.462 --> 01:31:50.703
It was a pleasure.

01:32:00.598 --> 01:32:03.636
Your Honors,
and may it please the court.

01:32:06.730 --> 01:32:09.598
Your Honors,
and may it please the court.

01:32:09.816 --> 01:32:11.603
Your Honors, and may it...

01:32:12.318 --> 01:32:14.150
Section 214
of the Tax Code...

01:32:14.904 --> 01:32:17.191
Section 214 of the Tax Code...

01:32:26.708 --> 01:32:30.452
Your Honors,
and may it please the court.

01:32:57.947 --> 01:32:59.188
Good morning.

01:33:06.164 --> 01:33:07.621
You're ready for this.

01:33:07.999 --> 01:33:10.207
You've been ready for this
your whole life.

01:33:10.376 --> 01:33:14.165
So go in there and let the judges see
the Ruth Ginsburg I know.

01:33:20.762 --> 01:33:23.300
- Professor Brown.
- Marty. Good to see you.

01:34:06.516 --> 01:34:08.724
- Charlie.
- Good morning.

01:34:09.394 --> 01:34:12.057
- You must be Jane.
- Nice to meet you, Mr. Moritz.

01:34:16.276 --> 01:34:18.984
- Mr. Ginsburg.
- No. Uh, Mel Wulf.

01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:20.561
- ACLU.
- That's me.

01:34:20.655 --> 01:34:22.049
I'm Mr. Ginsburg.
Nice to meet you, Charles.

01:34:22.073 --> 01:34:23.109
A pleasure.

01:34:30.290 --> 01:34:32.623
Well, here we are.

01:34:39.841 --> 01:34:41.207
All rise.

01:34:42.802 --> 01:34:46.011
The United States Court of Appeals for
the Tenth Circuit is now in session.

01:34:46.347 --> 01:34:49.010
Judges Doyle, Holloway
and Daugherty presiding.

01:34:50.977 --> 01:34:52.017
Be seated.

01:34:56.524 --> 01:34:58.891
You have a century
of case law on your side.

01:34:58.985 --> 01:35:00.692
Just do your job.

01:35:03.406 --> 01:35:07.525
The first case
is docket number 71-1127.

01:35:07.619 --> 01:35:10.236
<i>Charles Moritz v. Commissioner
of Internal Revenue.</i>

01:35:10.705 --> 01:35:12.947
Each side will have 30 minutes
to present.

01:35:13.208 --> 01:35:15.621
When two minutes remain,
the court clerk will rise

01:35:15.710 --> 01:35:16.710
to give warning.

01:35:16.794 --> 01:35:18.911
When your time is up,
he will sit.

01:35:19.839 --> 01:35:20.955
Counsel for the appellant.

01:35:21.049 --> 01:35:23.382
Mr. Ginsburg, you may proceed.

01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:30.468
Good morning, Your Honors,
and may it please the court.

01:35:30.558 --> 01:35:32.971
Today we are going
to demonstrate that Section 214

01:35:33.061 --> 01:35:35.644
of the U.S. Tax Code
unfairly discriminates

01:35:35.730 --> 01:35:38.222
against our client,
Mr. Charles Moritz,

01:35:38.316 --> 01:35:39.773
because he is a man.

01:35:42.070 --> 01:35:45.063
Congress assumed that
a caregiver is most likely a woman.

01:35:45.573 --> 01:35:47.064
Is that so unreasonable?

01:35:47.951 --> 01:35:50.944
If the law says all caregivers
are entitled to a deduction,

01:35:51.329 --> 01:35:53.742
and if the writers in the back
of their mind thought,

01:35:53.831 --> 01:35:55.142
"Well, this will only
apply to women,"

01:35:55.166 --> 01:35:56.446
then that would be
an assumption.

01:35:56.626 --> 01:35:58.062
But they went
farther than that, Judge.

01:35:58.086 --> 01:36:01.420
They explicitly list
who qualifies as a caregiver.

01:36:01.506 --> 01:36:02.792
As is their prerogative.

01:36:03.549 --> 01:36:06.007
Yes. But Judge, I doubt that you would
turn the same blind eye

01:36:06.135 --> 01:36:08.969
- if it said only white caregivers.
- That's hardly the same thing.

01:36:09.430 --> 01:36:11.467
Respectfully, we disagree.

01:36:12.058 --> 01:36:13.535
I'm going to turn it over
to my co-counsel

01:36:13.559 --> 01:36:14.954
who will discuss
the constitutional questions.

01:36:14.978 --> 01:36:18.016
You're telling us that race
and gender are the same?

01:36:21.484 --> 01:36:22.484
My co-counsel...

01:36:22.568 --> 01:36:24.400
Yes, yes, we'll get to her
in a minute.

01:36:24.487 --> 01:36:26.695
But I'd appreciate
an answer to my question.

01:36:27.991 --> 01:36:29.573
In order for a law
to discriminate,

01:36:29.659 --> 01:36:32.242
it must distinguish
between groups arbitrarily.

01:36:32.328 --> 01:36:33.364
Is that correct?

01:36:34.664 --> 01:36:36.496
- My co-counsel will...
- Mr. Ginsburg.

01:36:36.916 --> 01:36:38.282
I have asked you.

01:36:44.507 --> 01:36:46.499
It must be arbitrary, yes.

01:36:46.718 --> 01:36:49.711
And in this case,
we believe the law is.

01:36:49.887 --> 01:36:52.220
Mr. Moritz is a man
who never married.

01:36:52.307 --> 01:36:55.471
That may make him less likely to
have childcare responsibilities,

01:36:55.560 --> 01:36:58.177
but not parent care
responsibilities.

01:36:58.271 --> 01:36:59.707
- And had he been a woman...
- And to your mind,

01:36:59.731 --> 01:37:02.519
classifications of this kind
must always be discriminatory?

01:37:02.608 --> 01:37:03.608
There's some help.

01:37:03.693 --> 01:37:05.776
He's asking him to make
a broad categorical claim.

01:37:05.862 --> 01:37:07.353
I can't speak
to always, Judge.

01:37:07.447 --> 01:37:10.235
I can only speak
to this case and this man.

01:37:12.285 --> 01:37:13.992
- Very well.
- Thank you.

01:37:14.287 --> 01:37:15.619
Then speak of him.

01:37:22.462 --> 01:37:25.955
Again, the only distinction
between our client Mr. Moritz

01:37:26.049 --> 01:37:27.756
and any other caregiver,

01:37:27.842 --> 01:37:30.630
in Judge Daugherty's words,
is arbitrary.

01:37:31.804 --> 01:37:35.138
Thank you. And I cede the remainder
of my time to my co-counsel.

01:38:02.377 --> 01:38:03.618
Your Honors...

01:38:06.756 --> 01:38:08.713
Whenever you're ready,
Mrs. Ginsburg.

01:38:12.095 --> 01:38:14.303
Your Honors,
and may it please the court.

01:38:15.014 --> 01:38:20.351
Section 214 denies Mr. Moritz
a caregiver tax deduction

01:38:20.436 --> 01:38:22.928
available to
similarly situated women...

01:38:23.022 --> 01:38:26.015
Yes. Yes. We've been
through all that.

01:38:26.109 --> 01:38:27.225
Uh,

01:38:27.318 --> 01:38:29.776
Mrs. Ginsburg, you are aware
that the government has

01:38:29.862 --> 01:38:32.024
three co-equal branches.

01:38:35.827 --> 01:38:38.194
- Mrs. Ginsburg?
- Yes, of course, Your Honor.

01:38:38.287 --> 01:38:41.871
And that it is
the Congress' role to write law.

01:38:44.669 --> 01:38:47.082
Your Honor, I understand
how government works.

01:38:49.048 --> 01:38:50.209
Take it easy, Ruth.

01:38:52.677 --> 01:38:55.420
Well, uh, sometimes a law,
even a good law,

01:38:55.513 --> 01:38:57.880
even a law that is legal
under the Constitution,

01:38:57.974 --> 01:39:00.011
may not be good for every
individual it affects.

01:39:00.101 --> 01:39:01.717
I have a question.

01:39:02.395 --> 01:39:04.057
If I understand correctly,

01:39:04.313 --> 01:39:05.313
you're concerned

01:39:05.398 --> 01:39:07.230
about men and women
being pigeonholed

01:39:07.316 --> 01:39:09.399
into certain roles
based on gender.

01:39:09.485 --> 01:39:10.726
Yes, that's correct.

01:39:11.362 --> 01:39:14.230
- Because...
- Excuse me. That wasn't my question.

01:39:14.323 --> 01:39:17.487
It strikes me that the caregiver
deduction does the opposite.

01:39:18.077 --> 01:39:21.036
It helps women be able
to work outside the home.

01:39:21.622 --> 01:39:22.738
Isn't that a good thing?

01:39:24.584 --> 01:39:26.871
But the law assumes
it must be the woman

01:39:26.961 --> 01:39:28.918
who is supposed to be at home
in the first place.

01:39:29.005 --> 01:39:31.668
Well, that is the case
in every family I know.

01:39:31.757 --> 01:39:33.437
So, it's the assumption
that's the problem.

01:39:33.468 --> 01:39:38.213
Then when can a law differentiate
on the basis of sex? Never?

01:39:40.057 --> 01:39:43.175
When the classification
rationally relates to the law.

01:39:44.103 --> 01:39:46.220
Keeping women out of combat,
for example.

01:39:46.314 --> 01:39:48.397
I'm not sure whether
I agree with that example.

01:39:48.483 --> 01:39:51.191
No. So, you think women belong
on the front lines now, too?

01:39:51.277 --> 01:39:52.813
No, that's not what...

01:39:53.988 --> 01:39:57.572
Gender, like race, is a biological,
unalterable trait.

01:39:57.658 --> 01:40:01.117
There is nothing that women are inherently
better at than men, nor vice versa.

01:40:01.871 --> 01:40:04.033
- Growing a beard.
- That's...

01:40:04.123 --> 01:40:05.705
Lactation.

01:40:05.791 --> 01:40:08.033
No thinking person
could possibly imagine that

01:40:08.169 --> 01:40:11.583
Charles Moritz's gender relates to his ability...

01:40:15.968 --> 01:40:17.925
Why can't we, Mrs. Ginsburg?

01:40:18.471 --> 01:40:21.464
In most households, aren't women
the primary caregivers?

01:40:22.058 --> 01:40:25.893
Aren't men the breadwinners?
Aren't they?

01:40:32.527 --> 01:40:34.769
In most households,
yes, Your Honor.

01:40:35.154 --> 01:40:37.020
Doesn't that reality suggest

01:40:37.114 --> 01:40:39.731
that that's the natural
order of things?

01:40:46.624 --> 01:40:48.616
Respectfully, Your Honors,
I'd like to reserve

01:40:48.709 --> 01:40:50.541
the remainder of my time
for rebuttal.

01:40:56.342 --> 01:40:59.005
Not sure I followed that.
How... How are we doing?

01:41:04.225 --> 01:41:06.217
It's okay.
It's not over yet.

01:41:20.992 --> 01:41:24.736
Mr. Bozarth,
for the appellee. You may proceed.

01:41:24.829 --> 01:41:28.743
Don't let them forget what
this case is really about. You'll be fine.

01:41:30.418 --> 01:41:33.877
Ah, Bozarth.
The, uh, master of citations.

01:41:34.589 --> 01:41:36.817
That's what my family calls me too, Judge.

01:41:40.136 --> 01:41:42.378
Your Honors,
and may it please the court.

01:41:43.014 --> 01:41:47.133
Congress created this tax deduction
to help caregivers go out and work.

01:41:48.185 --> 01:41:49.392
Caregivers.

01:41:50.521 --> 01:41:53.480
Folks that, if they weren't
working, would stay home.

01:41:55.234 --> 01:41:57.942
Now, are we meant
to believe that this man

01:41:58.529 --> 01:42:03.115
would have the skill or even the
caregiver's instinct to do that?

01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:04.720
Why can't we believe that?

01:42:05.077 --> 01:42:08.616
Why does an unwed woman have that instinct,
but not an unwed man?

01:42:08.706 --> 01:42:10.322
Or a widower,
for that matter?

01:42:10.541 --> 01:42:11.810
Well, respectfully,
Judge Doyle,

01:42:11.834 --> 01:42:15.453
a widower doesn't choose to be a caregiver.
It's thrust upon them.

01:42:16.505 --> 01:42:20.624
And as for women,
it doesn't take a legal treatise to prove

01:42:20.718 --> 01:42:24.302
what 100,000 years of human
history has made indelibly clear.

01:42:25.723 --> 01:42:29.592
And Congress can write the tax
code to enforce this natural law?

01:42:29.685 --> 01:42:31.722
Congress can write
whatever tax code it wants.

01:42:32.855 --> 01:42:37.020
All I'm saying, Judge,
is that given the natural order of things,

01:42:38.402 --> 01:42:42.362
this man, Mr. Moritz,
hasn't suffered as a result.

01:42:42.448 --> 01:42:46.567
But the country will suffer if the
court doesn't find for the appellee.

01:42:50.206 --> 01:42:52.267
Your Honors,
I am certain that there isn't a man among us

01:42:52.291 --> 01:42:54.783
who wouldn't try
to ease his wife's burdens.

01:42:54.960 --> 01:42:56.872
So I don't see
how we can judge negatively

01:42:56.962 --> 01:42:58.762
the members of Congress
who would do the same.

01:42:59.674 --> 01:43:01.210
And I'm not alone in that.

01:43:01.425 --> 01:43:03.132
There is a long
and honorable tradition

01:43:03.219 --> 01:43:05.632
in the courts of upholding
laws like this one.

01:43:07.515 --> 01:43:11.179
I for one would rather see my government
err on the side of caring too much,

01:43:12.978 --> 01:43:16.813
of trying too hard to help
the ladies of this country,

01:43:17.608 --> 01:43:20.942
rather than to be indifferent
to their unique burdens.

01:43:21.028 --> 01:43:22.769
Now, maybe
Mr. Moritz disagrees.

01:43:24.448 --> 01:43:26.360
Or maybe he just
doesn't like paying taxes.

01:43:28.661 --> 01:43:31.661
Personally, I don't believe that.
I believe that Charles Moritz is a victim.

01:43:32.915 --> 01:43:36.829
Not of his government,
but of the lawyers

01:43:36.919 --> 01:43:39.332
who have used his case
to achieve their own ends.

01:43:40.798 --> 01:43:44.633
Radical social change.

01:43:49.849 --> 01:43:52.307
We rest our case
on our briefs and argument,

01:43:52.768 --> 01:43:57.138
and ask that the court uphold the
Tax Court's decision. Thank you.

01:44:11.203 --> 01:44:15.538
Counsel for the appellant,
you have four minutes for rebuttal.

01:44:26.552 --> 01:44:28.259
Counsel for the appellant.

01:44:38.647 --> 01:44:39.728
Counselor.

01:44:53.746 --> 01:44:57.490
"Radical social change."

01:45:05.174 --> 01:45:08.258
When I was in law school,
there was no women's bathroom.

01:45:14.141 --> 01:45:16.349
It's amazing to me now
that we never complained.

01:45:17.102 --> 01:45:18.183
Not because we were timid.

01:45:18.270 --> 01:45:21.183
We were just astounded
to be in law school at all.

01:45:22.733 --> 01:45:25.817
A hundred years ago,
Myra Bradwell wanted to be a lawyer.

01:45:26.612 --> 01:45:29.821
She had fulfilled the requirements
for the Illinois Bar,

01:45:30.241 --> 01:45:33.450
but she wasn't allowed to
practice because she was a woman.

01:45:34.245 --> 01:45:37.955
An injustice she asked
the Supreme Court to correct.

01:45:39.875 --> 01:45:42.413
Illinois was so confident
of victory,

01:45:43.087 --> 01:45:46.125
they didn't even send a lawyer
to argue their side.

01:45:47.299 --> 01:45:49.541
They were right. She lost.

01:45:51.846 --> 01:45:55.510
That was the first time
someone went to court

01:45:55.599 --> 01:45:59.764
to challenge his or her
prescribed gender role.

01:46:00.688 --> 01:46:02.429
A hundred years ago.

01:46:06.193 --> 01:46:10.187
Radical social change.

01:46:14.326 --> 01:46:17.444
Sixty-five years ago,
when women in Oregon

01:46:17.538 --> 01:46:20.497
wanted to work overtime and
make more money as men could,

01:46:20.583 --> 01:46:23.872
the court looked to the precedent
in <i>Bradwell</i> and said no.

01:46:25.337 --> 01:46:27.078
So then there were
two precedents.

01:46:27.548 --> 01:46:30.882
Then three, then four,
and on and on,

01:46:30.968 --> 01:46:35.383
and you can draw a direct line from
Myra Bradwell to Gwendolyn Hoyt,

01:46:35.472 --> 01:46:40.058
told ten years ago she was not
entitled to a jury of her peers.

01:46:42.229 --> 01:46:46.519
That is the legacy the government
asks you to uphold today.

01:46:46.942 --> 01:46:51.437
You are being urged to protect
the culture and traditions

01:46:51.530 --> 01:46:54.773
and morality of an America
that no longer exists.

01:46:58.078 --> 01:47:02.573
A generation ago, my students would
have been arrested for indecency

01:47:03.042 --> 01:47:05.082
for wearing the clothes that they do.

01:47:05.711 --> 01:47:08.875
Sixty-five years ago,
it would have been unimaginable

01:47:08.964 --> 01:47:11.081
that my daughter
would aspire to a career.

01:47:13.928 --> 01:47:15.715
And a hundred years ago,

01:47:17.264 --> 01:47:20.257
I would not have the right
to stand before you.

01:47:30.945 --> 01:47:36.566
There are 178 laws that differentiate
on the basis of sex. Count them.

01:47:36.659 --> 01:47:39.572
The government did the favor
of compiling them for you.

01:47:40.079 --> 01:47:41.320
And while you're at it,

01:47:42.957 --> 01:47:44.414
I urge you to read them.

01:47:45.709 --> 01:47:48.998
They're obstacles
to our children's aspirations.

01:47:49.088 --> 01:47:52.581
You're asking us to overturn
nearly a century of precedent.

01:47:53.092 --> 01:47:55.129
I'm asking you
to set a new precedent,

01:47:55.844 --> 01:47:58.757
as courts have done before
when the law is outdated.

01:47:58.847 --> 01:48:01.806
But in those cases, the courts had
a clear constitutional handle.

01:48:03.852 --> 01:48:09.849
The word "woman" does not appear
even once in the U.S. Constitution.

01:48:11.402 --> 01:48:15.362
Nor does the word "freedom",
Your Honor.

01:48:30.921 --> 01:48:34.540
Go on, Professor Ginsburg.

01:48:41.056 --> 01:48:44.015
The principal purpose
of Section 214

01:48:44.685 --> 01:48:46.301
is not to protect women,

01:48:46.395 --> 01:48:48.057
nor to discriminate
against men.

01:48:48.147 --> 01:48:49.558
It is to provide caregivers

01:48:49.648 --> 01:48:52.607
the opportunity
to work outside the home.

01:48:52.693 --> 01:48:55.982
Therefore, as the Supreme Court
did in <i>Levy v. Louisiana,</i>

01:48:56.613 --> 01:48:58.445
this court should
fix the law

01:48:58.532 --> 01:49:01.115
most in line
with the legislative intent.

01:49:02.077 --> 01:49:04.194
Extend the deduction
to never-married men.

01:49:05.539 --> 01:49:08.077
Help all caregivers equally.

01:49:12.838 --> 01:49:16.206
Charles Moritz was well-raised
to be the sort of man

01:49:16.300 --> 01:49:18.508
we should all hope
our sons will become.

01:49:19.428 --> 01:49:22.842
Charlie deserves
our admiration.

01:49:23.348 --> 01:49:25.214
Not only has he taken
on the burden

01:49:25.434 --> 01:49:28.552
of caring for
his very strong-willed mother

01:49:28.645 --> 01:49:30.853
when no one
would expect it of him,

01:49:31.440 --> 01:49:35.275
but in doing so,
he has surpassed the limitations

01:49:35.652 --> 01:49:40.147
the rest of us, and our laws,
seek to force upon him.

01:49:41.575 --> 01:49:44.192
We're not asking you
to change the country.

01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:48.238
That's already happened
without any court's permission.

01:49:49.124 --> 01:49:53.459
We're asking you to protect
the right of the country to change.

01:49:57.591 --> 01:50:00.800
Our sons and daughters
are barred by law

01:50:01.428 --> 01:50:02.964
from opportunities
based on assumptions

01:50:03.055 --> 01:50:04.387
about their abilities.

01:50:04.473 --> 01:50:06.430
How will they ever
disprove these assumptions

01:50:06.517 --> 01:50:10.477
if laws like Section 214
are allowed to stand?

01:50:11.772 --> 01:50:15.061
We all must take
these laws on, one by one,

01:50:15.150 --> 01:50:17.392
for as long as it takes,
for their sakes.

01:50:19.363 --> 01:50:21.150
And you have the power
to set the precedent

01:50:21.240 --> 01:50:22.947
that will get us started.

01:50:24.618 --> 01:50:28.282
You can right this wrong.

01:50:39.174 --> 01:50:42.087
We rest our case
on our briefs and argument

01:50:42.177 --> 01:50:47.844
and ask that you reverse
the Tax Court's decision.

01:51:11.999 --> 01:51:13.490
Kiki!

01:51:13.584 --> 01:51:15.041
That was perfect.

01:51:15.711 --> 01:51:16.771
That was perfect.

01:51:16.795 --> 01:51:18.252
We don't even know who won.

01:51:18.338 --> 01:51:20.455
Doesn't matter.
It was right.

01:51:21.842 --> 01:51:23.925
This is just the beginning.

01:51:25.262 --> 01:51:26.628
I'm going to go gloat.

01:51:29.600 --> 01:51:31.842
- Martin. Thank you.
- Of course, Charles.

01:51:31.935 --> 01:51:33.301
Jane.

01:51:34.146 --> 01:51:35.512
Ruth, I...

01:51:36.565 --> 01:51:37.772
I'll be in touch.

01:51:53.582 --> 01:51:54.582
You did it.

01:51:56.043 --> 01:51:57.909
We did it.

01:52:01.924 --> 01:52:04.382
Oh, I say we celebrate.

01:52:04.468 --> 01:52:07.131
We go pick up James
and get some pizza.

01:52:19.441 --> 01:52:21.478
<i>We'll hear arguments
next in number four,</i>

01:52:21.568 --> 01:52:22.684
Reed against Reed.

01:52:22.778 --> 01:52:27.773
...<i>next in 71-1694,</i>
Frontiero against Laird.

01:52:27.866 --> 01:52:29.903
Weinberger against Wiesenfeld.

01:52:36.875 --> 01:52:38.411
<i>Mrs. Ginsburg.</i>

01:52:38.502 --> 01:52:40.664
<i>Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the court.</i>

01:52:40.754 --> 01:52:45.340
<i>Amicus views this case
as kin to</i> Reed v. Reed...

01:52:45.425 --> 01:52:47.917
<i>The sex criterion stigmatizes</i>

01:52:48.011 --> 01:52:50.879
<i>when it is used to limit
hours of work for women only.</i>

01:52:50.973 --> 01:52:55.013
<i>It assumes that all women are
preoccupied with home and children.</i>

01:52:55.102 --> 01:52:57.469
<i>These distinctions
have a common effect.</i>

01:52:58.021 --> 01:53:00.934
<i>They help keep woman
in her place,</i>

01:53:01.024 --> 01:53:03.732
<i>a place inferior
to that occupied by men.</i>

01:53:03.819 --> 01:53:07.859
<i>The law must stop using sex
as a shorthand for functions which...</i>

01:53:07.948 --> 01:53:10.406
<i>The judgment enjoins
enforcement of the statute</i>

01:53:10.492 --> 01:53:14.076
<i>insofar as it discriminates
on the basis of sex.</i>

01:53:14.162 --> 01:53:19.783
<i>Laws of this quality help
to keep women not on a pedestal, but in a cage.</i>

01:53:19.876 --> 01:53:24.541
<i>Sarah Grimké said,
"I ask no favor for my sex.</i>

01:53:24.631 --> 01:53:26.497
<i>"All I ask of our brethren</i>

01:53:26.967 --> 01:53:30.631
<i>"is that they take their feet
off our necks."</i>
