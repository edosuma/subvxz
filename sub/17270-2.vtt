23:59.717 --> 24:00.916
Okay.

24:02.653 --> 24:04.219
Your father...

24:04.221 --> 24:06.188
was out of control.

24:06.190 --> 24:08.056
I never knew where he
was or what he was doing.

24:09.259 --> 24:11.026
But he was in trouble.

24:11.028 --> 24:12.927
I mean so much so that...

24:12.929 --> 24:15.864
one night he packed us up
and said, "We're moving."

24:15.866 --> 24:17.766
Do you remember that?

24:17.768 --> 24:20.168
Said we were going to see
the country, or something.

24:20.170 --> 24:22.270
No, we were on the run.

24:22.272 --> 24:25.906
We moved from city to city until
we ended up here, and then...

24:25.908 --> 24:27.941
then I thought we were done running.

24:27.943 --> 24:30.678
But it turns out your
dad was just done with me.

24:33.014 --> 24:34.815
(SIGHS) It didn't matter.

24:34.817 --> 24:36.783
I was already on my own anyway.

24:36.785 --> 24:38.737
That's why when you started
acting like him, I didn't...

24:38.738 --> 24:39.738
Mom...

24:41.722 --> 24:43.823
You will never go through that again.

24:45.025 --> 24:46.359
Okay? I promise.

24:51.332 --> 24:53.031
<i>- Would you hold still?
- TIM: Forgive me,</i>

24:53.033 --> 24:56.015
my exhaust system triggers
automatically, every six minutes.

24:56.135 --> 24:58.885
I built your exhaust system,
pal, spare me the lecture.

25:00.107 --> 25:02.074
Stephen's right. We should bring in Kurt.

25:03.076 --> 25:04.577
Here we go.

25:04.579 --> 25:06.512
Bank robber boy's a reckless jackass,

25:06.514 --> 25:09.113
but so was I. And I
turned out totally awesome.

25:09.115 --> 25:12.283
Look. I'm not judging this
kid, but we have rules.

25:12.285 --> 25:13.651
What about me?

25:14.986 --> 25:16.987
You had no business bringing me in.

25:16.989 --> 25:18.656
You risked your life.

25:18.658 --> 25:20.592
That was a long time ago, I was dumb.

25:22.994 --> 25:25.195
Not that I regret it.

25:25.197 --> 25:28.332
Well I don't want to regret sitting
on our hands doing nothing this time.

25:28.334 --> 25:29.933
Kurt needs us.

25:29.935 --> 25:32.836
Look, we get that you're
looking out for us, but...

25:32.838 --> 25:34.048
but Stephen called it.

25:34.049 --> 25:35.802
At some point we have got
to stop playing defense,

25:35.807 --> 25:38.141
and fight back.

25:38.143 --> 25:40.076
I mean we've hiding out
down here for two years.

25:40.078 --> 25:43.713
Which is two years longer than any
of us would have survived up top.

25:43.715 --> 25:45.781
We are all for survival.

25:45.783 --> 25:48.951
But if we're not going to stand up for
our own, what's the point of surviving?

25:54.791 --> 25:56.391
Any news on Kurt?

25:56.393 --> 25:58.826
- My guess is he's laying low.
- (COMPUTER BEEPING)

25:58.828 --> 26:00.862
This kid can teleport anywhere he wants,

26:00.864 --> 26:02.964
and we find him hiding
out in a crawl space?

26:02.966 --> 26:04.733
Is that kind of thing normal?

26:04.735 --> 26:06.334
Where did you go when you
discovered you had powers?

26:08.036 --> 26:09.871
- Nowhere.
- Exactly.

26:09.873 --> 26:13.974
The crazier life gets, the more we
want to hold on to what's familiar.

26:24.986 --> 26:26.787
(GASPS)

26:26.789 --> 26:28.388
It's where I would have come.

26:28.390 --> 26:31.591
- How the hell did you...
- Empty building, good view of your house.

26:31.593 --> 26:33.726
I got a family too, okay?
I'm not going to hurt you.

26:33.728 --> 26:35.795
You're the dick who ratted me out.

26:35.797 --> 26:38.130
I had no idea they were going to
send in a SWAT team, all right?

26:38.132 --> 26:39.865
You're lying or you're an idiot.

26:39.867 --> 26:42.001
Either way, I'll pass.

26:42.003 --> 26:45.937
Look, there's a group of us,
okay? Not the guys in the suits.

26:45.939 --> 26:49.174
A kind of paranormal underground.

26:49.176 --> 26:51.910
Okay? Where people like us are safe.

26:51.912 --> 26:53.945
You got to trust me. We've all
been through the same thing.

26:53.947 --> 26:57.683
- You're just trying to get in my head.
- I don't have to.

26:57.685 --> 27:00.051
Okay, I was you Kurt.

27:00.053 --> 27:01.719
Let me take a wild guess.

27:01.721 --> 27:02.486
You're robbing banks,

27:02.487 --> 27:04.969
because your Mom can't
afford to pay for your pills.

27:05.792 --> 27:07.024
And you feel responsible.

27:09.093 --> 27:11.662
How do you think I found you here?

27:11.664 --> 27:14.765
But I'm not the only one who can find you.

27:19.269 --> 27:21.638
So this paranormal underground...

27:21.640 --> 27:23.640
they're not going to try to kill me too?

27:23.642 --> 27:25.308
No, the opposite, okay?

27:25.310 --> 27:26.909
Just let me show you. Come with me.

27:26.911 --> 27:28.144
(PULSATING)

27:31.114 --> 27:33.749
VAUGHN: Thanks, kid.
I'll take it from here.

27:35.117 --> 27:36.685
Okay now, son...

27:36.687 --> 27:39.154
Take it easy. Okay. I
just want to talk to you.

27:41.825 --> 27:42.825
Ah!

27:45.695 --> 27:46.928
Don't hurt him.

27:46.930 --> 27:48.296
I'm just going to put
him asleep for a while.

27:52.601 --> 27:54.068
(THUDDING)

27:54.070 --> 27:55.936
(GRUNTING) Son of a...

27:55.938 --> 27:57.238
(BREATHING RAPIDLY)

27:59.708 --> 28:00.941
STEPHEN: Kurt! Stop!

28:05.112 --> 28:06.145
Kurt!

28:15.022 --> 28:16.022
Kurt! Stop!

28:21.595 --> 28:22.595
(GRUNTS)

28:24.030 --> 28:26.031
Kurt. (SIGHING) Kurt.

28:30.670 --> 28:33.739
Stop! Stop, you don't understand!

28:33.741 --> 28:35.974
Just listen to me.

28:35.976 --> 28:39.744
Listen to me, okay? You
and me, we're the same.

28:39.746 --> 28:41.178
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes.

28:43.883 --> 28:44.916
Prove it!

29:06.101 --> 29:07.268
(GASPING)

29:13.776 --> 29:14.776
Where's Kurt?

29:17.245 --> 29:19.179
Kurt?

29:19.181 --> 29:21.514
Kurt, I know you're up here.

29:21.516 --> 29:22.783
Kurt, I was like you.

29:25.186 --> 29:28.554
I was alone. Terrified.

29:30.258 --> 29:34.126
Every meal I ate was stolen
or fished out of a dumpster.

29:36.196 --> 29:37.616
But then somebody helped me.

29:38.417 --> 29:39.857
The way I want to help you.

29:40.668 --> 29:41.733
Just...

29:43.403 --> 29:45.237
tell me you're listening.

29:45.239 --> 29:48.473
No... it's gone too far.

29:48.475 --> 29:51.676
KURT: I pushed that guy
off the roof. He's fine.

29:52.678 --> 29:54.779
KURT: That's not possible.

29:54.781 --> 29:58.316
Come out, Kurt. You're not sick.

29:58.318 --> 30:00.551
You're one of us.

30:00.553 --> 30:03.554
I thought I told you...
(YELLING) to leave me alone!

30:08.193 --> 30:11.228
I'm just trying to help you!

30:14.165 --> 30:16.233
When you wake up.

30:16.235 --> 30:20.938
JEDIKIAH: Okay, let me just see if
I can get this straight here, uh...

30:20.940 --> 30:23.906
You could've captured
the breakout, but instead,

30:23.908 --> 30:27.003
you bulldozed your supervising
agent and let the target go free.

30:27.059 --> 30:28.324
He's green, I should've...

30:28.325 --> 30:30.345
There will be ample time to
explain yourself, Mr. Vaughn,

30:30.616 --> 30:32.963
right now we're focused on Stephen. Okay?

30:33.319 --> 30:35.886
I'm not helping you execute a kid.

30:35.888 --> 30:37.620
You know what? Maybe I don't belong here.

30:37.622 --> 30:39.489
I'm not offering you a choice.

30:39.491 --> 30:43.593
With powers like yours, I'm afraid
we can't let you just walk away.

30:43.595 --> 30:45.595
No. No.

30:45.597 --> 30:47.029
You know, what I'd like to believe

30:47.031 --> 30:50.500
is that this is just the
isolated act of a naive mind.

30:50.502 --> 30:54.570
If, however, it was something else...

30:54.572 --> 30:57.038
If it's a, uh... I don't know...

30:57.040 --> 31:02.878
a conspiracy to hand over a deviant
breakout to the Tomorrow People...

31:02.880 --> 31:06.214
Now, I have to say that that
would be quite unforgivable.

31:13.088 --> 31:15.590
- Anything you want to tell me, Stephen?
- No.

31:16.859 --> 31:18.926
Good. Good.

31:18.928 --> 31:22.094
Well, then your debrief
should be a piece of cake.

31:22.095 --> 31:23.095
Isn't this the debrief?

31:23.199 --> 31:25.060
Oh, no. That's done by a senior telepath.

31:25.061 --> 31:26.061
 She's very thorough. That's new.

31:29.136 --> 31:32.439
- Uh, pretty old, actually...
- May I?

31:36.143 --> 31:37.176
It was your dad's.

31:39.647 --> 31:40.880
Beautiful watch.

31:44.117 --> 31:47.386
One would never suspect. D chip.

31:49.222 --> 31:50.322
Deflects telepathy.

31:52.125 --> 31:55.327
Clever. Always the tinkerer, your dad.

31:55.329 --> 31:56.861
I am gonna keep this.

31:56.863 --> 32:00.231
I really don't want anything
compromising your first debriefing.

32:10.876 --> 32:13.176
(ALL LAUGHING)

32:13.178 --> 32:15.369
What do you think those
two are conspiring about?

32:16.170 --> 32:17.110
You don't want to know.

32:19.451 --> 32:22.118
- You did the right thing.
- Saving Stephen?

32:23.321 --> 32:25.522
Bringing Kurt in.

32:25.524 --> 32:27.524
But, yes. Saving Stephen.

32:30.126 --> 32:32.127
You can trust him, John.

32:32.129 --> 32:33.195
I know.

32:35.065 --> 32:37.633
You trust him. And I trust you.

32:39.937 --> 32:42.204
What do you say we swing by the hotel?

32:43.507 --> 32:45.273
Tim says our suite's empty.

32:47.409 --> 32:49.590
I'll teleport to that sushi bar of yours.

32:49.591 --> 32:51.234
Grab us some room service.

32:51.414 --> 32:52.681
(PULSATING)

32:52.683 --> 32:54.148
<i>STEPHEN: Cara, I'm in trouble.</i>

32:54.150 --> 32:56.084
It's him. It's Stephen.

32:57.620 --> 32:59.020
I may trust him.

33:00.089 --> 33:01.455
But I really hate his timing.

33:03.191 --> 33:04.925
What is it, Stephen?

33:04.927 --> 33:06.894
<i>STEPHEN: He took the watch,
and some bionic telepath</i>

33:06.896 --> 33:09.162
<i>is about to go postal inside my brain.</i>

33:14.302 --> 33:17.103
<i>- Get out of there.
- Not an option. What do I do?</i>

33:18.939 --> 33:22.041
<i>CARA: Stephen, if she gets in
your head, she'll know everything.</i>

33:22.043 --> 33:24.076
<i>You need to fill your
mind with something else.</i>

33:25.445 --> 33:28.481
An idea, an emotion, a memory.

33:28.483 --> 33:31.215
Something so overwhelming, so powerful,

33:31.216 --> 33:33.216
it eclipses everything else in your mind.

33:36.589 --> 33:38.189
Are you ready?

33:38.191 --> 33:40.125
Ready.

33:40.127 --> 33:41.960
What's your name?

33:41.962 --> 33:44.229
<i>STEPHEN: (THINKING) Stephen Jameson.</i>

33:44.231 --> 33:45.964
Is the sky blue?

33:45.966 --> 33:48.533
<i>Yeah, depending on the day.</i>

33:48.535 --> 33:52.102
<i>WOMAN: Did the Tomorrow People
assist today's breakout in his escape?</i>

33:54.072 --> 33:56.007
<i>STEPHEN: Not that I know of.</i>

33:56.009 --> 33:58.308
<i>WOMAN: Where's the breakout right now?</i>

33:58.310 --> 33:59.476
<i>STEPHEN: I don't know.</i>

34:01.580 --> 34:05.849
<i>WOMAN: Did the Tomorrow People
assist today's breakout in his escape?</i>

34:05.851 --> 34:07.617
<i>STEPHEN: No.</i>

34:07.619 --> 34:10.887
<i>WOMAN: Did the Tomorrow People
assist today's breakout in his escape?</i>

34:10.889 --> 34:13.822
<i>STEPHEN: I said no!</i>

34:38.324 --> 34:40.592
You really should keep
this at home, you know.

34:43.295 --> 34:46.197
Wouldn't want to scratch a family heirloom.

34:47.600 --> 34:48.833
Good idea.

34:54.806 --> 34:56.257
Congratulations.

34:56.259 --> 35:00.000
It appears you passed your debriefing
with flying colors. Good work.

35:00.247 --> 35:04.682
- Thank you.
- No, thank you for being a straight shooter.

35:04.684 --> 35:07.504
I have to admit, I was a tad
concerned we had a problem,

35:07.554 --> 35:09.603
but this seems to be nothing
more than a senior agent

35:09.604 --> 35:11.875
who failed to keep his trainee in check.

35:12.124 --> 35:15.458
- This wasn't Vaughn's fault.
- Oh, fault has nothing to do with it, Stephen.

35:15.516 --> 35:17.450
This is about accountability.

35:17.452 --> 35:21.253
If I cannot hold my agents
responsible for their subordinates,

35:21.255 --> 35:23.789
the efficacy of the
entire program breaks down.

35:23.791 --> 35:25.758
I'm accountable.

35:25.760 --> 35:27.893
Yes, there are people above me, Stephen.

35:29.396 --> 35:31.664
- Who?
- Another day.

35:31.666 --> 35:34.499
Look, I think the lesson today is clear.

35:34.501 --> 35:36.501
Failure will not be tolerated.

35:39.372 --> 35:40.805
So what happens to Vaughn?

35:42.641 --> 35:45.510
He's being put on a desk. Not your concern.

35:46.512 --> 35:47.679
Have a good night.

35:56.888 --> 35:58.321
(RINGING)

36:04.362 --> 36:05.863
(RINGING ECHOING)

36:29.719 --> 36:31.887
Hey, we gotta talk.

36:31.889 --> 36:34.155
If you wanna thank me for
saving your life, now we're even.

36:34.157 --> 36:36.591
No. I mean, yes, thank
you. But that's not...

36:36.593 --> 36:38.026
You wanna give me my watch back?

36:38.028 --> 36:41.395
It's my dad's watch and you can
tell me how you got it later.

36:41.397 --> 36:44.480
I came here to tell you that
you were right about Ultra.

36:44.481 --> 36:45.688
 I can't work there anymore.

36:45.868 --> 36:50.170
Hey, they killed my partner because of me.

36:50.172 --> 36:52.268
Now I thought I could find my dad

36:52.269 --> 36:54.149
without getting caught
up in my uncle's world.

36:54.443 --> 36:55.508
I was wrong.

36:57.144 --> 36:58.745
No, you weren't.

36:58.747 --> 37:00.880
I was.

37:00.882 --> 37:04.451
You said we can't keep running,
that we have to stand and fight back.

37:04.453 --> 37:05.885
You're right.

37:05.886 --> 37:08.250
But we need you on the
inside to do it, Stephen.

37:08.276 --> 37:10.522
Can't you see? This is
perfect, you working for Ultra.

37:10.589 --> 37:13.724
- The only way we can take it down is from...
- No, I'm not going back, okay?

37:13.726 --> 37:15.291
It's way too dangerous.

37:15.293 --> 37:17.594
Jedikiah already had
one of his evil telepaths

37:17.596 --> 37:20.531
try and figure out where
you guys were hiding.

37:20.533 --> 37:22.866
If he finds out, it's my fault.

37:24.301 --> 37:25.903
I can't do it.

37:25.905 --> 37:27.169
Okay? I'm...

37:32.843 --> 37:36.278
I won't put the people
I care about in danger.

37:36.280 --> 37:39.649
I didn't realize you had
such strong feelings for us.

37:39.651 --> 37:44.519
Look, if Ultra could get inside
your head, they'd be here right now.

37:44.521 --> 37:46.555
Look, you had that watch.

37:46.557 --> 37:49.558
Your father gave me that when he left.

37:49.560 --> 37:53.261
Not just to protect me, he told
me it was to remind me to be brave.

37:56.331 --> 37:58.566
I guess somehow I must've forgotten that.

37:59.868 --> 38:01.669
Thanks for reminding me, Stephen.

38:02.871 --> 38:04.337
It's yours now.

38:11.846 --> 38:13.513
STEPHEN: Thanks for coming.

38:14.848 --> 38:17.083
Are you sure we're safe here?

38:17.085 --> 38:18.751
Ultra can't pick up on us.

38:18.752 --> 38:20.930
There's a few safe spots
like this in the city.

38:21.355 --> 38:24.290
Whoever built this place was one of us.

38:24.292 --> 38:26.859
They also happen to have amazing dumplings.

38:26.861 --> 38:29.428
I meant safe from your boyfriend.

38:29.430 --> 38:31.429
My what?

38:31.431 --> 38:32.798
John?

38:32.800 --> 38:35.667
It's a... it's not like that.

38:35.669 --> 38:38.870
What's it like then? Oh,
wait. Okay, let me guess.

38:38.872 --> 38:41.406
It's a new species of
relationship. In the future,

38:41.408 --> 38:43.603
people won't have to use outdated terms

38:43.604 --> 38:44.604
like "boyfriend" and "girlfriend."

38:44.878 --> 38:47.578
Did you really bring me here
to talk about my personal life?

38:47.580 --> 38:49.446
No. (LAUGHING)

38:50.649 --> 38:52.617
(SIGHING) I just wanted to thank you.

38:54.653 --> 38:57.521
For talking me through a bad situation.

38:59.858 --> 39:01.258
How'd you do it?

39:02.260 --> 39:04.193
How'd you keep 'em out of your head?

39:05.262 --> 39:06.562
I did what you told me.

39:07.832 --> 39:11.367
I thought of something that
could fill my whole mind.

39:11.369 --> 39:13.903
I focused on the most painful
thing I could think of.

39:17.474 --> 39:18.674
I'll show you.

39:27.684 --> 39:29.484
What are you doin' up?

39:29.486 --> 39:31.687
I heard you and Mom fighting.

39:31.689 --> 39:33.656
Are you going somewhere?

39:33.658 --> 39:35.657
Yes.

39:35.659 --> 39:37.191
But I'll be back.

39:41.296 --> 39:43.097
I need you to do me a favor.

39:43.099 --> 39:45.366
- I need you to look after your mom. Can you...
- I don't want you to go.

39:45.368 --> 39:48.302
I know, honey. I don't either.

39:52.339 --> 39:55.676
Be brave for me, Stephen. Be brave.

40:10.857 --> 40:12.925
That's why I have to find him.

40:12.927 --> 40:15.928
I can't let that be my
last memory of my dad.

40:16.997 --> 40:19.198
What are you gonna do?

40:19.200 --> 40:21.767
I'm gonna do what he asked me to do.

40:21.769 --> 40:23.735
<i>STEPHEN: I'm gonna take care of my family.</i>

40:28.507 --> 40:30.374
<i>I'm going to be a better brother.</i>

40:36.749 --> 40:38.549
<i>A better son.</i>

40:42.553 --> 40:44.421
<i>And a better friend.</i>

40:50.461 --> 40:52.896
<i>To both of our species.</i>

40:52.898 --> 40:56.532
<i>Because what I've realized is that I
can't turn my back on either of them.</i>

40:56.534 --> 40:58.434
(YELLING) You cheater!

41:01.504 --> 41:05.608
(INDISTINCT TALKING)

41:05.610 --> 41:08.006
<i>But the only way I can do all this</i>

41:08.007 --> 41:10.682
is by pretending to be a good soldier.

41:10.783 --> 41:13.216
<i>By working for my uncle.</i>

41:13.218 --> 41:15.718
<i>Staying one step ahead of him.</i>

41:19.089 --> 41:21.891
<i>And that is what I'm going to do.</i>

41:24.027 --> 41:28.297
Keep an eye on him. His
former partner was negligent.

41:28.299 --> 41:30.365
But his debrief was clean.

41:30.367 --> 41:32.133
Too clean.

41:32.135 --> 41:35.837
- You think he's still in touch with them?
- Oh, I do.

41:35.839 --> 41:39.641
And when the time comes, Stephen
will lead us to the Tomorrow People.

41:39.643 --> 41:41.243
And we'll kill them.
