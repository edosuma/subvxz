00:05.314 --> 00:07.719
Previosuly on Mystery Incorporated...

00:07.839 --> 00:09.308
Where did this come from?

00:09.588 --> 00:10.908
Cuarto llave!

00:11.028 --> 00:13.904
The fourth key. To what and why,
I don't know.

00:14.024 --> 00:15.573
Must have something to do with the treasure

00:15.693 --> 00:17.112
buried under Crystal Cove.

00:18.008 --> 00:21.115
What's with the crazy music score?

00:21.235 --> 00:22.844
Those dots weren't there before!

00:22.964 --> 00:24.014
That means

00:24.134 --> 00:26.577
the planispheric disc has changed.

00:33.600 --> 00:36.224
For the first time in our history
of mystery solvers,

00:36.344 --> 00:39.064
we have to consider that something truly
supernatural

00:39.184 --> 00:40.759
is happening here.

00:47.851 --> 00:50.024
Sorry to bother you so early, kids.

00:50.144 --> 00:52.801
But he neighbors have been calling in
constantly

00:52.921 --> 00:56.890
with reports of unearthly moaning,
inhuman howling, blood curling screams...

00:57.010 --> 00:59.314
In other words, same old same old.

00:59.434 --> 01:01.217
You can count on us, Mayor Nettles.

01:01.337 --> 01:03.845
We'll see if there's anything mysterious
going on here.

01:03.965 --> 01:04.958
Thanks, kids.

01:05.541 --> 01:07.038
Come on, come on, let's go!

01:07.158 --> 01:08.158
Let's get this over with.

01:08.271 --> 01:09.181
After we're finished here,

01:09.301 --> 01:11.618
we need to relocate the planispheric disc.

01:11.641 --> 01:13.887
- We'll do it.
- Good idea, Scoob.

01:14.007 --> 01:18.254
Yeah, you and I will re-hide the disc while
you guys check out the scary howls.

01:18.374 --> 01:20.152
You're out of luck, Shaggy. Remember?

01:20.272 --> 01:21.998
Fred hid the disc last time.

01:22.118 --> 01:23.679
He's the only one who knows where it is.

01:23.765 --> 01:25.647
Oy, can we hurry? Please?

01:25.767 --> 01:27.195
Okay, let's get started.

01:27.315 --> 01:28.826
But, first, well, gang...

01:28.946 --> 01:31.288
- it looks like we got another...
- Mystery on our hands!

01:31.408 --> 01:32.497
Oh, Fred...

01:32.617 --> 01:35.443
we're such soul mates...
We're finishing each other's sentences...

01:35.563 --> 01:38.249
- Come on, let's...
- Split up and look for clues?

01:38.966 --> 01:42.282
Like, I guess that means
we're all soul mates, haha.

01:48.846 --> 01:49.860
Ugh.

01:50.094 --> 01:52.382
Look at those creepy eyes!

01:52.502 --> 01:55.488
And that disgusting yellow hair!

01:55.813 --> 01:58.348
And the horrible tentacle around its neck!

01:58.468 --> 02:00.429
Makes me wanna hork.

02:00.871 --> 02:01.716
Oh.

02:04.181 --> 02:07.197
It's me! Phew, that was close.

Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

03:03.600 --> 03:05.201
That's right, Mayor Nettles.

03:05.269 --> 03:06.803
The place wasn't haunted.

03:06.870 --> 03:08.870
Daphne found the neighbor's cat
locked up in there.

03:08.938 --> 03:11.273
Poor thing had
irritable bowel syndrome.

03:11.340 --> 03:14.043
Huh? Ugh.

03:14.111 --> 03:17.681
Yes. That's why it was making
all those terrible noises.

03:17.749 --> 03:19.684
No, you're more than welcome.

03:19.751 --> 03:22.654
It's 20 minutes past rendezvous
time and still no Fred.

03:22.722 --> 03:25.090
I'm virtually assured
of my first tardy ever.

03:25.158 --> 03:27.660
What if he's hurt? Let's
go back in and find him.

03:27.728 --> 03:30.563
Like, I'm sure
Freddie's fine, Daph.

03:30.631 --> 03:32.132
We were all over that house.

03:32.200 --> 03:33.701
And the only scary things
we found

03:33.768 --> 03:35.102
were an unhappy cat

03:35.170 --> 03:37.205
and Scooby-Doo doing
an impression of my mom

03:37.273 --> 03:39.007
using an old hat
from the attic.

03:39.075 --> 03:40.976
Oh, Norville.

03:41.043 --> 03:44.046
Eat all that broccoli
or no television.

03:46.850 --> 03:48.284
It's all in the hat.

03:48.352 --> 03:49.418
Hello, friends.

03:49.486 --> 03:52.322
Oh, Freddie.
Thank goodness.

03:52.389 --> 03:53.823
This place was a total bust.

03:53.891 --> 03:55.125
Nothing scary here.

03:55.192 --> 03:56.960
So let's get to school
before we're late.

03:57.028 --> 03:59.562
Punctuality is an important
facet of learning.

03:59.630 --> 04:00.730
Right, Daphne?

04:00.798 --> 04:02.799
Um, right, Fred.

04:02.867 --> 04:07.971
If you step on it, Fred, we can
still make it to school on time.

04:09.407 --> 04:10.574
Careful or you'll
flood the engine.

04:10.642 --> 04:12.744
- Huh?
- Tricky carburetor, remember?

04:12.811 --> 04:14.078
Righty-o.

04:14.146 --> 04:17.149
Ok, let's roll-io.

04:22.422 --> 04:24.590
Hey, what do you two
think you're doing?

04:24.657 --> 04:26.426
Having a little snack.

04:26.493 --> 04:27.861
No eating in the van.

04:27.928 --> 04:29.429
Eating leads to crumbs.

04:29.497 --> 04:30.830
Crumbs lead to germs.

04:30.898 --> 04:32.766
Germs lead to sick days
from work,

04:32.834 --> 04:35.869
secretly crippling
the nation's economy.

04:41.910 --> 04:42.943
Huh?

04:47.282 --> 04:50.083
What happened?

04:54.889 --> 04:56.389
Gang?

04:56.457 --> 04:57.857
Gang!

04:57.925 --> 05:00.961
Daphne!

05:02.897 --> 05:05.565
"No signal anywhere."

05:07.268 --> 05:09.736
Anybody! Hello!

05:10.605 --> 05:12.740
Hello!

05:17.546 --> 05:18.746
Huh?

05:28.090 --> 05:29.357
No. No!

05:29.425 --> 05:30.591
This is all wrong.

05:30.659 --> 05:32.694
Crystal Cove has
much greener lawns

05:32.761 --> 05:33.828
and fewer skeletons.

05:33.896 --> 05:36.598
Velma! Shaggy!

05:36.666 --> 05:40.102
Scooby-Doo, where are you?

05:41.805 --> 05:44.340
- What are you doing?
- Making a stop.

05:50.481 --> 05:53.183
Ugh, Fred is acting funny.

05:53.251 --> 05:54.718
And not like ha-ha funny,

05:54.786 --> 05:56.019
not funny at all.

05:56.087 --> 05:57.655
Yeah, freaky funny.

05:57.723 --> 05:58.923
I'm sure it's just a phase.

06:01.127 --> 06:02.428
Norbert, catch.

06:02.495 --> 06:04.463
- You drive.
- Me drive?

06:04.531 --> 06:05.965
Norbert?

06:08.468 --> 06:11.203
Freddie, is there
anything bothering you?

06:11.271 --> 06:12.972
Bothering me?

06:13.039 --> 06:14.240
Not at all, dear girlfriend.

06:14.307 --> 06:16.308
I'm just listening
to the baseball game.

06:16.376 --> 06:19.211
I love sports.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.727
Does the dog need walking?

06:34.795 --> 06:37.130
I walk myself, Fred.

06:37.198 --> 06:39.833
Perhaps you would enjoy
a canine crumpet.

06:39.901 --> 06:40.967
Hmm.

06:41.035 --> 06:43.570
That is not
a Scooby snack, Fred.

06:43.638 --> 06:44.738
Humph!

06:44.806 --> 06:45.872
What difference does it make?

06:45.940 --> 06:47.507
I'm sure they all
taste the same.

06:49.243 --> 06:50.577
You eat them, then.

06:50.644 --> 06:52.678
What was that, Scoobert?

06:52.746 --> 06:55.215
Uh, nothing.
Nothing.

07:02.757 --> 07:05.959
There! Ahh!

07:06.027 --> 07:08.428
There she is!

07:11.966 --> 07:13.633
I don't understand any of this.

07:13.701 --> 07:15.135
What happened to Crystal Cove?

07:15.202 --> 07:16.803
What happened to the people?

07:16.871 --> 07:19.272
What happened to
your groovy paintjob?

07:24.912 --> 07:26.613
Mr. Traples.

07:26.681 --> 07:27.748
What happened here?

07:27.815 --> 07:30.283
Please, tell me
what's going on.

07:32.186 --> 07:35.756
Velma. Shaggy. Scooby.

07:35.823 --> 07:36.890
They're...

07:36.958 --> 07:38.792
They're...Oh, no.

07:38.860 --> 07:40.527
No. It's impossible.

07:40.595 --> 07:42.429
How could it get any worse?

07:47.034 --> 07:48.568
Daphne's scarf.

07:48.636 --> 07:50.603
No. It can't be.

07:50.671 --> 07:52.338
It can't be true.

07:52.406 --> 07:54.174
Daphne!

07:54.242 --> 07:58.412
No!

08:11.365 --> 08:12.476
Daphne.

08:12.596 --> 08:13.445
Fred?

08:13.565 --> 08:15.334
Cut it out,
Mr. Traples.

08:15.402 --> 08:17.538
It's not funny you
imitating Daphne like that.

08:17.658 --> 08:20.273
Freddie, is that really you?

08:20.341 --> 08:21.808
Daphne?

08:21.875 --> 08:25.345
Fred, where have you been?

08:25.413 --> 08:26.446
Aah!

08:26.514 --> 08:28.581
Oh, Freddie, don't look at me.

08:28.648 --> 08:29.658
I'm hideous.

08:29.778 --> 08:32.951
Daphne, is that really you?

08:33.019 --> 08:34.595
Of course it's me, silly.

08:34.715 --> 08:37.322
And jeepies,
you found my scarf.

08:37.390 --> 08:41.360
I've been looking
all over for this.

08:46.399 --> 08:48.701
I still don't understand.

08:48.768 --> 08:51.337
I came out of that mirror
and everything had changed.

08:51.404 --> 08:53.806
Why is everyone a skeleton
and why are you...

08:53.874 --> 08:55.411
Do I really look
so awful, Freddie?

08:55.590 --> 08:57.358
Uh, no.

08:57.426 --> 08:58.860
When you didn't come back,

08:58.927 --> 09:01.062
something went crazy
with the planispheric disk.

09:01.129 --> 09:03.764
Velma said it created
a vortex around Crystal Cove

09:03.832 --> 09:05.032
and sped up time here.

09:05.100 --> 09:06.767
We searched everywhere for it.

09:06.835 --> 09:08.202
You hid it too well.

09:08.270 --> 09:10.204
Decades whirred by in weeks.

09:10.272 --> 09:12.106
Everyone aged quickly

09:12.173 --> 09:14.275
and one by one, turned to dust

09:14.342 --> 09:16.010
until only I was left.

09:16.077 --> 09:18.045
I didn't mean for
any of this to happen.

09:18.113 --> 09:21.214
I...I'm just
a really good hider.

09:21.282 --> 09:23.216
You've got to change it back.

09:23.284 --> 09:26.019
Right up till the end,
Velma said the planispheric disk

09:26.087 --> 09:27.520
could reverse the process.

09:27.588 --> 09:28.955
Where did you hide it, Freddie?

09:29.023 --> 09:31.424
We have to get that disk.

09:31.492 --> 09:33.259
Then that's what we'll do.

09:33.327 --> 09:35.761
Daphne, Mr. Traples,
load up.

09:35.829 --> 09:38.865
We've got a future to change.

09:40.834 --> 09:43.369
The F-F-Fearatorium
Food Emporium.

09:43.436 --> 09:45.104
Shaggy and Scooby
loved this place.

09:45.172 --> 09:47.106
It was hidden here
the whole time?

09:47.174 --> 09:48.341
Yep. Come on.

09:51.345 --> 09:52.546
Everybody out.

09:52.613 --> 09:54.280
Like, this is more like it.
Ha ha ha!

09:54.348 --> 09:57.250
The F-F-Fearatorium
Food Emporium

09:57.318 --> 09:59.252
makes me, like, f-f-famished.

09:59.320 --> 10:01.621
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:01.689 --> 10:02.989
What's wrong with you two?

10:03.056 --> 10:04.490
You're like bottomless pits.

10:04.558 --> 10:06.158
We're not here
to indulge your munchies.

10:06.226 --> 10:07.994
We're here for that
planispheric disk.

10:08.061 --> 10:10.096
Freddie, you're the one
who hid it here.

10:10.163 --> 10:12.331
I don't understand why
you don't know where it is.

10:12.399 --> 10:14.533
Oh, you don't understand?

10:14.601 --> 10:16.936
Intellect isn't
your strong suit, huh?

10:17.004 --> 10:19.138
What about you?
Got any smarts in there

10:19.206 --> 10:21.107
behind those eye goggles?

10:21.175 --> 10:23.509
Hmmph.

10:25.112 --> 10:27.013
Freddie, we've
looked everywhere.

10:27.081 --> 10:28.280
It's not here.

10:28.348 --> 10:30.549
Hey, wait a minute.
You're right.

10:30.617 --> 10:33.185
This wasn't the last place
I hid the disk.

10:33.253 --> 10:35.954
The trip through the mirror
must have jangled my memory.

10:36.022 --> 10:37.356
Now I remember.

10:37.423 --> 10:39.325
Never mind, change of plans.

10:39.393 --> 10:41.394
This isn't where
I left it after all.

10:42.496 --> 10:45.031
The Arcane-A-Rama
Movieplex?

10:45.099 --> 10:46.299
You hid the disk here?

10:46.367 --> 10:48.601
Sure. I would think
you of all people

10:48.669 --> 10:51.804
would realize why this place would be
so important to me, don't you, Daph?

10:51.872 --> 10:54.140
Because we had our
first date here, Freddie.

10:54.208 --> 10:56.776
I can always count on you
to remember stuff like that.

10:56.844 --> 10:58.210
Come on.

10:58.278 --> 11:00.413
It's got to be here somewhere.

11:00.480 --> 11:02.815
- Keep searching.
- What's the score?

11:02.883 --> 11:05.985
The score, Norbert, is that we're
gonna find that disk tonight.

11:06.053 --> 11:07.720
I meant the score
to the baseball game.

11:07.788 --> 11:09.188
That you're listening to.

11:09.256 --> 11:10.656
On that thingymabob.

11:10.724 --> 11:11.958
Heh. I knew that.

11:12.025 --> 11:14.193
It's not Norbert.
It's Norville.

11:14.261 --> 11:15.495
And nobody calls him that.

11:15.563 --> 11:17.297
It's always Shaggy.

11:17.364 --> 11:20.133
I suggest less nitpicking
and more searching.

11:20.200 --> 11:22.135
Wait. What?
It's not here.

11:22.203 --> 11:24.137
Get back in the van.

11:25.906 --> 11:28.207
The kennel of
the horrible hounds?

11:28.275 --> 11:29.742
Shaggy used to board
Scooby here

11:29.810 --> 11:31.411
when he and his folks
went on vacations.

11:31.478 --> 11:34.046
I'm pretty sure I put
the planispheric disk here.

11:36.650 --> 11:38.418
Fred, this is all very bizarre.

11:38.485 --> 11:41.487
You don't know the meaning
of the word, child.

11:41.555 --> 11:44.691
I just remembered
where I actually hid the disk.

11:47.461 --> 11:51.364
Here we are.
This time for sure.

11:51.432 --> 11:53.767
The education board
of Crystal Cove?

11:53.834 --> 11:55.969
Why? That's so random.

11:56.037 --> 11:58.038
I'm surprised at you, Daphne.

11:58.106 --> 11:59.673
Education is
very important to me.

11:59.741 --> 12:01.842
Isn't it, Mr. Traples?

12:05.180 --> 12:06.380
I don't know.

12:06.448 --> 12:08.015
Look in all the desks, I guess.

12:08.083 --> 12:11.386
I'll check out
the superintendent's office.

12:11.453 --> 12:14.188
Gang, something is
definitely wrong here.

12:14.256 --> 12:17.291
I mean, is it me or is Fred
acting even stranger than usual?

12:17.359 --> 12:18.760
It's not you.

12:18.827 --> 12:20.495
Maybe if we can
retrace our steps,

12:20.562 --> 12:21.796
we'll see a pattern.

12:21.863 --> 12:25.399
F-F-Fearatorium
Food Emporium.

12:25.467 --> 12:28.403
Arcane-A-Rama Movieplex.

12:28.470 --> 12:31.305
Kennel of the horrible hounds.

12:31.373 --> 12:33.941
Education board
of Crystal Cove.

12:36.679 --> 12:38.313
Fake Fred?

12:38.380 --> 12:39.947
I knew it.

12:40.015 --> 12:41.415
Then who is he?

12:41.483 --> 12:43.384
And who sent the message?

12:43.452 --> 12:45.319
My guess?
The real Fred.

12:45.387 --> 12:48.256
Wherever he is, he's probably
in life-threatening peril.

12:48.324 --> 12:51.159
And in the clutches
of some hideous creature.

12:51.227 --> 12:53.161
Where is it, Fred?
Where is it?

12:53.229 --> 12:54.329
Take it easy, Daph.

12:54.397 --> 12:56.331
At least we now know
it's not here.

12:56.399 --> 12:57.566
You don't understand, Fred.

12:57.634 --> 12:59.134
We have to find that disk now.

12:59.202 --> 13:02.171
It's almost midnight.
They'll be waking up soon.

13:02.239 --> 13:03.305
What? Who?

13:08.579 --> 13:12.248
The skeletons. The skeletons
walk after midnight.

13:12.315 --> 13:13.415
Run!

13:20.423 --> 13:21.757
Come on.

13:26.327 --> 13:29.995
Hurry, Daph!

13:32.098 --> 13:33.463
Aah!

13:36.431 --> 13:37.497
Come on, baby, come on.

13:37.565 --> 13:38.699
Start.

13:38.766 --> 13:41.034
Freddie! Freddie,
they're coming.

13:43.403 --> 13:45.337
Ahh!

13:56.409 --> 13:59.045
Fred Jones, you remember
every trap you ever built.

13:59.112 --> 14:00.512
Why can't you remember
where you hid

14:00.514 --> 14:02.515
the most important relic
in the universe?

14:02.583 --> 14:04.450
Trap. That's it.

14:04.518 --> 14:05.617
Now I remember.

14:09.389 --> 14:11.722
It's at the old
abandoned factory.

14:14.660 --> 14:17.228
Ha ha!
Now that's more like it.

14:17.295 --> 14:19.363
Should I just keep driving
around in circles,

14:19.431 --> 14:21.798
Mr. Fred, sir?

14:25.303 --> 14:27.337
No, the old abandoned
factory, hippie.

14:27.405 --> 14:28.338
And floor it.

14:33.811 --> 14:35.412
This isn't the way
to the factory.

14:35.480 --> 14:37.748
I'm willing to bet
it's the way to the factory.

14:37.815 --> 14:39.583
The real factory.

14:40.785 --> 14:43.453
Fred, we're headed
straight for that wall.

14:43.521 --> 14:44.854
It's solid brick.

14:44.922 --> 14:47.657
Is it, or is it?

14:49.593 --> 14:50.760
Aah!

14:53.129 --> 14:57.733
Fake. As fake as everything else in the
old abandoned Crystal Cove movie studio.

14:57.800 --> 15:00.835
And as fake as you, Daphne.

15:00.903 --> 15:02.770
How...How did you know?

15:02.838 --> 15:03.905
Two big ones.

15:03.972 --> 15:05.339
The real Daphne would
never forget

15:05.407 --> 15:08.343
that our first date
was at the Trap Expo 3000.

15:08.410 --> 15:11.779
But the biggest mistake
was right at the start.

15:11.847 --> 15:13.882
- What?
- You said jeepies.

15:13.949 --> 15:15.383
Daphne says jeepers.

15:15.451 --> 15:16.785
Velma says jinkies.

15:16.852 --> 15:18.286
Nobody says jeepies.

15:18.354 --> 15:20.555
I mean, that's just
plain silly.

15:20.623 --> 15:22.557
Once I knew you were fake,

15:22.625 --> 15:24.726
I figured Crystal Cove
must be phony, too.

15:24.794 --> 15:26.528
It could only be
the old movie studio

15:26.596 --> 15:28.563
made to look like
a ruined town,

15:28.631 --> 15:30.665
complete with
animatronics skeletons.

15:33.970 --> 15:37.639
Obviously this was all about the
location of the planispheric disk.

15:37.707 --> 15:39.775
Convincing me that I needed
to save my friends

15:39.842 --> 15:41.776
from a post-apocalyptic
future

15:41.844 --> 15:44.646
was the most obvious way to get
me to tell you where I hid it.

15:44.714 --> 15:47.282
It's exactly what
I would have done.

15:48.985 --> 15:51.386
Fan out. Search every
inch of this place

15:51.454 --> 15:53.088
until we find that disk.

15:53.156 --> 15:54.990
Well, like, if you
remember hiding it here,

15:55.058 --> 15:56.959
like, dude, where is it?

15:57.026 --> 16:00.963
Well, the exact location
slipped my mind.

16:03.967 --> 16:05.601
We can't let that fake Fred

16:05.669 --> 16:07.503
get his hands on
the planispheric disk.

16:07.571 --> 16:09.138
What do we do?

16:10.574 --> 16:13.175
Like, we do what
the real Fred would do.

16:13.243 --> 16:15.377
- We trap him.
- Agreed.

16:15.445 --> 16:17.780
But it's got to be
before he gets his hands on...

16:17.847 --> 16:19.315
The planispheric disk.

16:19.383 --> 16:20.783
I found it!
I found it!

16:20.851 --> 16:21.918
Ok, never mind.

16:21.985 --> 16:23.419
Now that you've got it,

16:23.487 --> 16:24.487
what are you going
to do with it?

16:24.555 --> 16:25.788
Fake Fred.

16:25.856 --> 16:27.390
Ahh, well done.

16:27.457 --> 16:29.725
You finally figured out
I'm an imposter.

16:29.793 --> 16:32.595
So what? I'm taking
the planispheric disk,

16:32.662 --> 16:34.430
and who's going to stop me?

16:34.497 --> 16:35.831
You? You?

16:35.899 --> 16:38.834
No!

16:38.902 --> 16:40.702
Me.

16:40.770 --> 16:43.137
I mean you. Me.
I mean me.

16:43.205 --> 16:45.273
You me.
Aw, heck.

16:45.341 --> 16:47.442
You get the idea.

17:00.223 --> 17:02.057
Don't just stand there, Shaggy.

17:02.125 --> 17:03.459
Get in there and help Fred.

17:03.526 --> 17:04.460
Which one?

17:04.528 --> 17:06.429
Uh, the good one.

17:06.496 --> 17:08.064
Be careful, Fred.
Don't hurt him.

17:08.131 --> 17:10.500
Aah!

17:10.568 --> 17:12.903
Daphne, you look terrible.

17:12.970 --> 17:14.671
You should get more sleep.

17:16.906 --> 17:18.508
Aah!

17:25.483 --> 17:27.784
Hyah!

18:03.089 --> 18:05.591
Aah!

18:11.466 --> 18:12.733
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

18:27.349 --> 18:28.984
Huh?

18:32.622 --> 18:34.990
Ahh!

18:35.058 --> 18:36.024
Ahh!

18:36.092 --> 18:38.594
I'll never give up this disk.

18:38.661 --> 18:40.630
You'll never beat me.

18:44.501 --> 18:46.236
I don't need to beat you.

18:46.303 --> 18:49.339
I just need you to stay put.

18:52.311 --> 18:54.078
Whoa!

18:54.146 --> 18:55.847
Ahh! Ahh!

19:02.055 --> 19:04.623
Get me out of this.
He's the fake.

19:04.691 --> 19:06.458
They're, like, identical,

19:06.526 --> 19:08.060
right down to the ascot.

19:08.128 --> 19:09.795
Which one's the real Fred?

19:09.863 --> 19:10.929
Allow me.

19:10.997 --> 19:12.965
Freddie, how do you feel
about me?

19:13.032 --> 19:15.467
What do you mean?
You're my love, Daphne.

19:15.535 --> 19:17.937
- I'm crazy about you.
- And you?

19:18.004 --> 19:20.706
Uh, gosh.
Gee, Daph,

19:20.774 --> 19:23.809
you know, I...
well, I guess aside from traps

19:23.877 --> 19:25.511
and solving mysteries, um...

19:25.579 --> 19:28.247
er, my stomach's getting hurty.

19:28.315 --> 19:31.517
Oh, Freddie.
It's you!

19:31.585 --> 19:32.518
Mwah!

19:32.586 --> 19:35.121
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

19:35.188 --> 19:38.725
Well, if you're so smart,
then who am I really?

19:38.792 --> 19:42.628
You're one of the most heartless
criminals Mystery Inc. has ever faced.

19:42.696 --> 19:44.730
Aren't you, dad?

19:44.798 --> 19:45.798
Ow!

19:45.865 --> 19:47.633
It's not a mask, you imbecile.

19:47.701 --> 19:50.302
I had plastic surgery
to look like you.

19:50.370 --> 19:52.604
You would have spotted
a mask too quickly.

19:52.672 --> 19:54.573
I don't know what you think
you were doing.

19:54.640 --> 19:56.808
You're supposed to be
my father.

19:56.876 --> 19:58.844
But how could you try
to impersonate me

19:58.911 --> 20:01.747
when you know absolutely
nothing about me?

20:01.814 --> 20:06.251
If he's Brad, that makes you
Fred's sneaky criminal mom,

20:06.319 --> 20:07.252
Judy.

20:07.320 --> 20:08.686
Ouch! Watch it.

20:08.754 --> 20:10.822
I had plastic surgery, too.

20:10.890 --> 20:12.157
I know.

20:12.225 --> 20:13.726
Brad Chiles and Judy Reeves?

20:13.793 --> 20:15.828
Heh heh.
But, like, why?

20:15.896 --> 20:17.230
Yeah. Why?

20:17.297 --> 20:19.498
For the treasure.
What else?

20:19.566 --> 20:22.335
It was the genius mind
of Professor Pericles

20:22.402 --> 20:24.070
that thought up the whole plan.

20:24.137 --> 20:25.204
Wasn't it, Judy?

20:25.272 --> 20:26.606
That's right, Brad.

20:26.673 --> 20:28.274
While we went under the knife,

20:28.342 --> 20:30.242
Professor Pericles
had Mr. E arrange

20:30.310 --> 20:32.678
for the Crystal Cove studio
to be changed

20:32.746 --> 20:34.881
into an exact replica
of the town.

20:34.948 --> 20:37.751
Except more end of
the world-ish, obviously.

20:37.818 --> 20:39.419
I hate to be the one
to point this out,

20:39.420 --> 20:41.788
but that's just crazy.

20:41.856 --> 20:43.289
Is it, Velma?

20:43.357 --> 20:45.191
Or is it so brilliant

20:45.259 --> 20:47.794
you cannot begin to fathom
its true genius?

20:47.861 --> 20:49.896
Professor Pericles?

20:49.964 --> 20:51.364
You failed, Professor.

20:51.432 --> 20:53.866
You'll never get your
filthy talons on this disk.

20:53.934 --> 20:56.736
On the contrary, Frederick.

20:56.804 --> 20:58.938
You are going to
hand it over to me,

20:59.006 --> 21:02.175
along with my associates,
your dear parents,

21:02.243 --> 21:07.080
or else I will destroy the one
thing you care about most.

21:07.148 --> 21:08.115
Zoinks!

21:08.183 --> 21:10.150
Freddie!

21:10.218 --> 21:11.952
Fine. You win.

21:12.020 --> 21:13.554
Take it.

21:13.621 --> 21:16.123
Excellent.

21:16.958 --> 21:18.892
Auf Wiedersehen,

21:18.960 --> 21:21.295
you beautiful kinder.

21:21.363 --> 21:24.999
Aah!

21:27.235 --> 21:29.469
Freddie, I'm so sorry.

21:29.537 --> 21:30.904
Pericles got away with the disk

21:30.972 --> 21:33.206
because I got grabbed
by robots.

21:33.274 --> 21:34.841
Don't worry, Daph.

21:34.908 --> 21:37.810
The important thing is
that you're back safe and sound.

21:37.878 --> 21:40.679
And you look good again.

21:40.747 --> 21:45.217
Only now Pericles
has the planispheric disk.

21:45.284 --> 21:48.320
I'm coming for you, master.

21:56.463 --> 22:00.032
I'm coming to set you free.
