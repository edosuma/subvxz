WEBVTT

00:15.980 --> 00:18.255
All I'm saying is that you're
way behind with little Wyatt.

00:18.524 --> 00:21.482
- You should have applied before this.
- Yeah, well, you know,

00:21.777 --> 00:23.256
he's not even a year old yet.

00:23.488 --> 00:26.207
So? I had my Jake signed up
for Mommy and Me

00:26.491 --> 00:29.483
- when I was still pregnant with him.
- Really, you can do that?

00:29.783 --> 00:33.219
Oh, absolutely. In fact, I'm surprised
that they let you sign up this late.

00:33.538 --> 00:35.768
Everybody wants to get in here
because it gets you

00:36.041 --> 00:38.919
into Elderberry Preschool, which is
a feeder for Hoskins Elementary

00:39.212 --> 00:41.328
and Bentley Middle School.

00:44.676 --> 00:46.075
Doesn't have any siblings, does he?

00:47.595 --> 00:49.506
No. How did you know?

00:49.764 --> 00:51.914
Because he doesn't play well
with others.

00:52.183 --> 00:55.300
Oh, don't worry about it. It's a common
problem among only children.

00:55.601 --> 00:58.513
All the more reason to start developing
their social skills early.

00:58.812 --> 01:00.450
First things preschools look for,
you know.

01:00.690 --> 01:04.285
Yeah, well, that's why we're here.

01:08.990 --> 01:09.979
Excuse me.

01:10.617 --> 01:13.256
- Hi, thanks for coming.
- Oh, of course, you know,

01:13.536 --> 01:17.609
anything for our little nephew.
What exactly are we doing

01:17.958 --> 01:19.710
- for our nephew?
- Showing family support.

01:19.958 --> 01:22.426
They look for it. Especially
when the father's not around a lot.

01:22.711 --> 01:23.746
What are you talking about?

01:23.962 --> 01:26.522
- Leo's around all the time.
- Yeah, for Wyatt. But he won't be

01:26.799 --> 01:28.676
for the school. He can't be.

01:28.925 --> 01:31.644
What are you doing?
Put that thing down.

01:32.221 --> 01:33.973
I'm trying to reach Richard.
I can't find him.

01:34.222 --> 01:36.611
You've been trying to call Richard
for the last couple days.

01:36.893 --> 01:40.488
- Maybe you should give it a rest.
- But I'm just afraid he's off on some

01:40.814 --> 01:42.964
magical freak-out or something,
you know.

01:43.233 --> 01:45.906
And I just want to be able
to help him.

01:46.192 --> 01:47.750
Maybe he just needs
a little time alone.

01:47.985 --> 01:50.545
It makes me question whether or not
I can even save an innocent

01:50.822 --> 01:53.382
if I can't save my boyfriend.

01:53.742 --> 01:57.735
- No offence.
- No, don't worry about it. I'm over it.

01:58.204 --> 02:00.240
- Jason?
- Yeah, when you get to be my age,

02:00.498 --> 02:03.456
you can't spend the time
crying over spilled milk, you know.

02:03.752 --> 02:06.266
- Your age?
- Yeah, the whole biological clock thing,

02:06.547 --> 02:08.424
it's very real and it's echoing:

02:09.800 --> 02:13.510
Okay, neurotic people, can we get
back to my neurosis right now, please?

02:13.844 --> 02:15.641
Sure, which one
were we talking about?

02:15.888 --> 02:20.245
The one where I'm a rotten mother
who's raising an antisocial child.

02:20.643 --> 02:23.157
Oh, that is ridiculous. And not true.

02:23.437 --> 02:27.146
Is it? He doesn't have any friends,
Phoebe. You and I had each other

02:27.484 --> 02:30.282
when we were growing up. But he
doesn't have anybody, he's all alone.

02:30.778 --> 02:32.575
Hey, I was all alone.

02:32.822 --> 02:36.531
But you didn't know you had power,
so it was safe for you to have friends.

02:36.865 --> 02:39.459
Your mother didn't have to worry about
if you were gonna orb out

02:39.743 --> 02:43.053
- during a play date or something.
- You think you're overreacting a little?

02:46.878 --> 02:48.277
No.

02:58.723 --> 03:01.681
You cannot keep doing this,
sweetie, really.

03:01.977 --> 03:03.695
Oh, guys...

03:05.686 --> 03:07.358
What the...?

03:11.608 --> 03:13.360
Oh, this is not good.

03:14.738 --> 03:15.853
Help!

03:16.115 --> 03:18.265
Orb him out of here. Go.

03:22.705 --> 03:25.014
Oh, thank God you're home.

03:33.673 --> 03:35.629
What the hell was that?

03:35.884 --> 03:37.636
That...

03:37.885 --> 03:39.603
...was the Headless Horseman.

05:13.102 --> 05:14.501
- Okay.
- You're very kind.

05:14.728 --> 05:19.119
Yeah, can I ask you just one question?
How are you still talking?

05:19.483 --> 05:20.882
Yes, well, fair question.

05:21.111 --> 05:24.865
Fortunately, the rest of me is still
at Magic School, otherwise I'd be...

05:25.199 --> 05:27.554
I'm sorry, Magic School?

05:27.825 --> 05:31.022
Yes, that's right... Anyway,
as I was saying, as long as my body

05:31.330 --> 05:35.289
remains on grounds, I can't...
Well, you know, die.

05:35.626 --> 05:37.423
It's all part of the magic, thankfully.

05:37.668 --> 05:40.057
Like the doorway
in the middle of my stairway.

05:40.337 --> 05:43.454
Sorry, I didn't know where to put it.
It's the only way in or out of the school.

05:43.759 --> 05:45.477
- I had to reach you.
- Do you have a name?

05:45.718 --> 05:48.278
Sigmund. But I'm afraid we don't have
much time for pleasantries.

05:48.554 --> 05:50.465
I need to get you back
before he strikes again.

05:50.723 --> 05:51.951
- The Headless Horseman.
- Right.

05:52.185 --> 05:53.743
Fabulous.

05:55.062 --> 05:57.098
- Where's Wyatt?
- He's upstairs in his room.

05:57.481 --> 06:00.314
I thought I should bring Leo...

06:00.609 --> 06:03.567
Oh, my God,
and apparently I was right.

06:04.528 --> 06:07.167
Leo! Oh, it's so good
to see you again!

06:07.447 --> 06:08.516
Sigmund, what happened?

06:09.200 --> 06:12.158
- Wait, you guys know each other?
- Gideon sent me for your help.

06:12.453 --> 06:14.762
- All your help.
- Gideon? Who's Gideon?

06:15.039 --> 06:18.031
- And who are you?
- All right, all you people with legs,

06:18.333 --> 06:19.891
follow me.

06:20.169 --> 06:22.046
You wait here.

06:22.547 --> 06:23.900
Hurry.

06:24.133 --> 06:27.523
Leo, just so you know,
this is what's keeping your son

06:27.842 --> 06:30.754
- from developing social skills.
- And me from helping Richard.

06:31.053 --> 06:33.567
And me from helping me.

06:33.849 --> 06:35.441
- What?
- I'm talking about our lives.

06:35.684 --> 06:38.244
We can't just drop what we're doing
every time somebody's head

06:38.519 --> 06:39.838
comes rolling down the stairs.

06:40.481 --> 06:42.392
I don't believe you're saying this.

06:42.649 --> 06:45.846
You don't understand,
this isn't supposed to happen.

06:46.152 --> 06:48.347
Magic School is supposed
to be protected from evil.

06:48.613 --> 06:51.173
It's the only way Gideon can teach
magic to the next generation...

06:51.450 --> 06:52.678
Wyatt's generation.

06:52.907 --> 06:55.421
I think Wyatt is more concerned
with nursery school right now

06:55.703 --> 06:57.500
- than Magic School.
- Are you sure?

06:58.122 --> 07:00.431
Paige said he orbed back
in front of the door.

07:00.709 --> 07:02.427
He was drawn to it.

07:03.253 --> 07:05.926
Okay, you know what, I think we
should help the Magic School.

07:06.215 --> 07:09.287
Because we can't just keep that head
on our foyer table, you know.

07:09.591 --> 07:11.866
What is it, a centrepiece?

07:12.137 --> 07:14.287
Okay, fine,
but we can't take Wyatt, sorry.

07:14.556 --> 07:16.831
All right. I'll get Chris to watch him.

07:17.100 --> 07:20.331
What? After everything he's done?
No, I don't think so.

07:20.643 --> 07:22.759
- He was just trying to protect Wyatt.
- Oh, please.

07:23.020 --> 07:26.296
I think his intentions are good.
He deserves another chance.

07:43.791 --> 07:45.827
Are you sure
you can breathe in there all right?

07:46.085 --> 07:47.916
Yes, l...

07:48.170 --> 07:49.239
We must move quickly.

07:49.464 --> 07:50.977
- All right.
- Just step around it.

07:51.216 --> 07:53.810
Someone will be along for it shortly.

07:55.636 --> 07:58.025
Wow, impressive.

07:58.306 --> 07:59.705
How long is this hallway?

07:59.934 --> 08:02.209
No one really knows.
It's endless.

08:02.477 --> 08:05.071
- Great.
- So how are we gonna find

08:05.356 --> 08:06.835
this dude Gideon anyway?

08:07.066 --> 08:10.183
He's not a dude, he's an Elder...
My old mentor, actually.

08:10.483 --> 08:12.201
Really?
You've never mentioned him before.

08:12.444 --> 08:14.833
We met a long time ago
when I first became a whitelighter.

08:15.113 --> 08:17.866
He helped me out, took me under
his wing. He actually fought for us

08:18.157 --> 08:21.308
- to get married... To break the rules.
- Really?

08:26.249 --> 08:28.717
I don't want to freak you out,
but there's a wolf following us.

08:29.003 --> 08:30.038
What?

08:31.130 --> 08:33.563
There was a wolf following us,
I swear.

08:33.842 --> 08:35.754
Not everyone sees
the same things here, Phoebe.

08:36.009 --> 08:37.283
Only what they're meant to see.

08:37.510 --> 08:39.386
Who you got in there, Confucius?

08:46.686 --> 08:48.039
Okay, you all saw that, right?

08:48.272 --> 08:50.945
Eleventh-grade levitation. She's late.

08:51.233 --> 08:53.224
We should keep moving,
the great hall is just ahead.

09:22.723 --> 09:25.157
Leo, good. Thanks for coming.

09:25.434 --> 09:28.107
Although I do wish it was under
better circumstances.

09:28.393 --> 09:31.703
- Gideon...
- And the Charmed Ones.

09:32.022 --> 09:36.220
Lovely to see you again. Although you
probably don't remember meeting me.

09:36.569 --> 09:38.844
You were just little girls.

09:39.280 --> 09:40.679
Leo.

09:40.906 --> 09:43.784
Gideon, I believe
your invisibility shield is still up.

09:44.827 --> 09:47.546
I'm sorry, I'm just a little distracted
with everything

09:47.830 --> 09:50.549
- that's been going on around here.
- Yes, we heard.

09:53.167 --> 09:57.399
- Sigmund, oh, I'm so sorry.
- It's all right, sir.

09:57.756 --> 09:59.872
Didn't stop me from delivering
the message now, did it?

10:00.133 --> 10:02.601
Okay, would somebody
please tell me what's going on here?

10:03.094 --> 10:05.403
Always were the restless one.

10:05.680 --> 10:07.318
Just like your Grams.

10:09.100 --> 10:13.776
Well, it all started
innocently enough, actually.

10:14.148 --> 10:18.664
Pranks, really. Setting the rats
loose from the Pied Piper.

10:19.025 --> 10:22.461
Turning the north dorm
into a gingerbread house.

10:22.780 --> 10:24.452
Kids.

10:25.116 --> 10:27.676
- And then?
- And then someone cast a spell

10:27.952 --> 10:29.863
that brought forth the darkness.

10:30.120 --> 10:34.557
And days became nights,
nights became terror,

10:35.000 --> 10:37.753
and the Headless Horseman
has roamed the campus ever since,

10:38.046 --> 10:40.321
targeting teachers.

10:41.884 --> 10:45.035
Forgive me, sir, perhaps you'd like
to orb me over to the other heads?

10:45.344 --> 10:46.663
Right.

10:46.886 --> 10:48.365
- Good thinking.
- Nice to meet you.

10:48.848 --> 10:50.167
You too, dude.

10:53.018 --> 10:56.647
So, what you're saying is somebody's
trying to shut down the school

10:56.980 --> 10:59.653
by cutting off teachers' heads?

10:59.941 --> 11:04.059
What else could it be? What better
way for evil to gain an upper hand,

11:04.404 --> 11:05.883
than to thwart the next generation?

11:06.115 --> 11:08.151
Isn't it as simple
as finding who conjured

11:08.406 --> 11:09.964
the Horseman
and reversing the magic?

11:10.199 --> 11:14.238
Yes, except no student possesses
that level of magic.

11:14.581 --> 11:15.934
At least they're not supposed to.

11:16.166 --> 11:19.078
That's why I believe that a demon from
the outside has somehow corrupted

11:19.378 --> 11:20.970
one of them into doing his bidding.

11:21.213 --> 11:24.410
So you find the student,
you find the evil, right?

11:24.717 --> 11:25.866
True.

11:26.092 --> 11:28.208
Except that you find much more
than that here, Paige.

11:30.764 --> 11:34.996
The answers you each seek
can be found within these grounds.

11:35.349 --> 11:37.260
You merely have to be open to them.

11:38.269 --> 11:41.784
Teaching will help you find
the student in question.

11:42.108 --> 11:45.817
But it will also remind you
of what you fear you have lost.

11:48.322 --> 11:52.759
Investigating our nursery school will
help you with your worries over Wyatt.

11:54.537 --> 11:58.371
And if you follow the wolf,
she will lead you where you want to go.

11:58.708 --> 11:59.936
But be careful.

12:00.166 --> 12:02.885
The deeper you look,
the more you will discover.

12:03.377 --> 12:06.494
And the better chance
you will have of saving...

12:06.799 --> 12:07.993
...all this.

12:19.813 --> 12:22.247
Who does he think he is?
Obi-Wan Kenobi?

12:22.524 --> 12:24.242
How can I be afraid
of losing something

12:24.484 --> 12:26.281
if I don't know what I've lost?

12:26.524 --> 12:28.833
Maybe that's why he wants you
to take over Sigmund's class.

12:29.110 --> 12:30.225
So you can remember.

12:30.446 --> 12:31.845
Remember what?

12:32.073 --> 12:33.950
Your gift, perhaps.

12:34.199 --> 12:37.350
Now, whatever you do, be strong.
Don't let them intimidate you.

12:37.661 --> 12:40.971
This may be advanced magic,
but they're still just kids.

12:42.458 --> 12:44.335
Help! Stop it!

12:46.046 --> 12:47.957
Oh, my God.

12:50.591 --> 12:52.627
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

12:53.302 --> 12:55.896
Telepathy isn't the coolest
power now, is it, Zach?

12:56.180 --> 12:57.977
- No.
- Did you do that?

12:59.183 --> 13:02.061
Excuse me, I'm talking to you.
Did you do that?

13:02.603 --> 13:04.833
- Yeah, so what if I did?
- What's your name?

13:05.523 --> 13:07.161
Quinton.

13:10.653 --> 13:12.325
What's so funny?

13:17.324 --> 13:19.076
What?

13:19.536 --> 13:23.245
Thanks a lot, Slick.
Get me in trouble, why don't you?

13:26.585 --> 13:29.975
What's the matter, teach?
You seem a little out of sorts.

13:30.297 --> 13:33.414
Me? No, I'm perfectly fine.

13:37.888 --> 13:40.243
Thank you. You're a conjurer.

13:40.933 --> 13:42.605
Yeah.

13:42.850 --> 13:45.318
And I'd watch your
pretty little neck if I was you.

13:51.651 --> 13:55.280
Here, wolfie, wolfie, wolfie.

13:56.489 --> 13:58.161
Come on.

13:58.407 --> 14:00.716
I know you're here somewhere.

14:01.160 --> 14:04.197
Here, wolfie, wolfie, wolfie...

14:08.875 --> 14:11.787
Oh, hi. Hi, sweet wolfie.

14:12.087 --> 14:15.477
Okay, you don't have to attack me,
because Gideon sent me...

14:17.384 --> 14:20.456
Where are you going? Come on.

14:40.365 --> 14:41.718
Neat trick.

14:42.199 --> 14:43.314
Can you shape-shift

14:43.534 --> 14:46.253
- into the Headless Horseman as well?
- I'm a shaman,

14:46.538 --> 14:48.449
not a shape-shifter.

14:48.706 --> 14:52.619
The wolf is merely a projection
of your quest. A symbol.

14:53.963 --> 14:56.397
Fascinating.
You didn't answer my question.

14:57.133 --> 14:59.727
Do you really think I lured you out here
just to kill you, Phoebe?

15:01.552 --> 15:03.827
You have the power of premonition.

15:04.096 --> 15:07.054
But it's unreliable. Especially lately.

15:07.349 --> 15:10.625
I can help you
see your future more clearly.

15:10.936 --> 15:14.087
If you're willing to take the risk.

15:16.650 --> 15:18.720
I don't know what the hell
Gideon was talking about,

15:18.987 --> 15:21.547
because this is certainly not
what I'm looking for.

15:21.823 --> 15:24.018
Still, Wyatt doesn't have to
hide his powers. Plus he's

15:24.281 --> 15:26.511
- not gonna be all alone.
- No, he'll be surrounded

15:26.783 --> 15:29.058
- by all the other freaks.
- They're not freaks.

15:29.329 --> 15:32.924
You know what I mean. I just want
Wyatt to have a normal upbringing.

15:33.250 --> 15:36.048
At least as normal as possible.
Is that too much to ask for?

15:37.213 --> 15:38.532
I don't know. Maybe.

15:39.382 --> 15:41.373
Well, we're not shopping
for preschools,

15:41.633 --> 15:44.750
we're shopping for headhunters.
So where is...?

15:45.514 --> 15:48.665
Sorry, had a little emergency.
Go ahead.

15:48.975 --> 15:51.694
- Now, where were we?
- You were telling us about

15:51.975 --> 15:53.886
your near miss with the Headless...

15:54.311 --> 15:57.269
I don't want to scare the little ones.
They may have powers

15:57.565 --> 15:59.715
- but they're still innocent.
- How did you get away?

15:59.985 --> 16:03.580
I astral projected. Confused him,
I guess, by creating two of me.

16:03.905 --> 16:06.658
- Thank God.
- Are you suggesting that

16:06.949 --> 16:11.227
- one of these kids might be in...?
- Involved? Oh, dear, no. No. Never.

16:11.579 --> 16:14.013
- Why would you be a target?
- These children are the cradle

16:14.291 --> 16:16.964
of good magic. Its entire future.

16:17.250 --> 16:21.482
Without proper guidance, nurturing,
they could easily be turned...

16:21.839 --> 16:23.272
Evil?

16:24.132 --> 16:25.929
Yeah.

16:27.970 --> 16:29.608
What's that?

16:33.100 --> 16:34.419
- Anybody hurt?
- Not yet.

16:35.437 --> 16:37.997
- You guys okay?
- You're a teacher now. Be careful.

16:38.273 --> 16:40.912
- Come on, I'll take you back.
- Wait, don't leave...

16:41.190 --> 16:42.464
Piper!

16:53.578 --> 16:54.806
Great.

16:55.037 --> 16:56.868
Just great.

17:06.549 --> 17:07.664
Easy.

17:07.883 --> 17:09.396
Easy.

17:10.344 --> 17:12.493
- Easy, watch the hair.
- Sorry.

17:12.763 --> 17:15.800
- You doing okay up there, honey?
- Actually, I feel a little woozy.

17:16.099 --> 17:17.532
Maybe because
we have you up too high.

17:17.769 --> 17:20.488
- Want me to move you down lower?
- No, I don't want Wyatt to see me

17:20.771 --> 17:23.410
- like this. He will freak out.
- Well, you know, on the plus side,

17:23.690 --> 17:26.250
this is a great way
for Wyatt to get out and socialise.

17:26.778 --> 17:28.973
If I had legs, I would kick you.

17:31.449 --> 17:33.087
Could you move this for me, please?

17:34.241 --> 17:35.674
Yeah.

17:38.330 --> 17:40.764
<i>You know, maybe I should just go
upstairs and check the Book</i>

17:41.041 --> 17:43.032
and see of there's a spell
that can fix this.

17:43.295 --> 17:47.686
Or we can find the child that conjured
the Horseman and vanquish it.

17:48.049 --> 17:49.721
You think that would
reverse the spell?

17:49.967 --> 17:52.037
- I'm hoping.
- You know, I keep getting this weird

17:52.303 --> 17:54.863
feeling that it's one
of the students in my class.

17:55.140 --> 17:57.415
- Why?
- Because who better to turn

17:57.681 --> 17:59.990
than one of the most
powerful kids there?

18:00.267 --> 18:02.576
- What do you suggest?
- I think we should bring them here.

18:02.853 --> 18:04.605
- What?
- Yeah, if we get them away

18:04.856 --> 18:06.812
from school, they can't conjure
the Horseman.

18:07.067 --> 18:09.501
That way we keep them here
long enough to figure out who it is.

18:09.778 --> 18:12.656
Actually, it's not a bad idea,
since you're targets now.

18:14.074 --> 18:15.063
Phoebe.

18:15.283 --> 18:17.513
- I'll go get her.
- No. I do not want Wyatt

18:17.786 --> 18:20.823
to have two headless parents.
Send Chris.

18:32.174 --> 18:33.926
- What the hell is going on?
- I can explain.

18:34.177 --> 18:35.690
- You okay, buddy?
- What was he doing?

18:35.928 --> 18:38.522
Nothing! I mean, nothing bad.

18:38.806 --> 18:40.603
- I swear.
- Nothing bad? He's a demon.

18:40.850 --> 18:43.842
But he wasn't hurting him. I promise.
Wyatt's shield wasn't even up.

18:44.146 --> 18:46.865
I trusted you. I vouched for you.

18:47.649 --> 18:49.526
Look, just let me explain.

18:49.774 --> 18:51.685
Get out of here.

18:51.943 --> 18:53.217
Paige, please?

18:55.322 --> 18:56.755
Now!

19:00.743 --> 19:03.211
- Is he okay?
- Yeah, I think so.

19:03.538 --> 19:06.132
Listen, I'm gonna take him up there
where it's safe. Do you mind...?

19:06.416 --> 19:10.807
Getting Phoebe? No, not at all.
I just hope there's all of her to get.

19:19.470 --> 19:21.381
So if you're so innocent,
why are you hiding out?

19:21.640 --> 19:23.995
- I'm protecting myself.
- From what? You're a student.

19:24.267 --> 19:26.337
The bad guy's only
after the teachers, right?

19:26.603 --> 19:29.720
I'm not protecting my body.
I'm protecting my powers.

19:30.482 --> 19:34.270
I sense someone trying to invade
mine. To use them for themselves.

19:34.945 --> 19:36.503
How do I know
you're telling the truth?

19:36.738 --> 19:39.730
You're an empath. You tell me.

19:41.114 --> 19:42.263
I can't tell.

19:44.411 --> 19:47.483
It's because you're conflicted.
Questioning your own magic.

19:47.791 --> 19:50.749
Your very future.
It's affecting your powers.

19:51.044 --> 19:52.875
I'm not questioning my future.

19:54.339 --> 19:57.490
Okay, maybe just a little bit.
But how do you know that?

19:57.800 --> 20:00.314
The wolf is a pack animal.

20:00.595 --> 20:03.029
But constantly searching

20:03.307 --> 20:05.775
for something she craves...

20:06.349 --> 20:08.340
...but cannot find.

20:08.893 --> 20:12.772
Seeing it means
you're searching too.

20:13.940 --> 20:16.738
Drink this.
Take the vision quest.

20:17.027 --> 20:19.257
There you will find
the answers we both seek.

20:20.447 --> 20:22.915
- I'm not drinking that.
- No?

20:25.578 --> 20:28.092
Tick, tick, tick...

21:16.085 --> 21:19.555
You didn't tell me
I could get hurt on this vision quest.

21:19.882 --> 21:23.079
You didn't ask.
The vision is of your future, Phoebe.

21:23.382 --> 21:26.658
- It's no less real than anything else.
- And no less dangerous.

21:26.970 --> 21:30.440
Great. More demons in my future.
It's exactly what I wanted.

21:30.766 --> 21:32.916
But are there any more
beyond the light?

21:33.851 --> 21:36.240
That's what you
really want to see, isn't it?

21:38.482 --> 21:41.394
There you are, I've been looking
all over for you, Pheebs.

21:41.693 --> 21:44.207
Are you okay?
What happened, the Horseman?

21:45.698 --> 21:47.290
No...

21:48.114 --> 21:50.787
My inner demons, apparently.

21:51.368 --> 21:54.360
Well, it's good to see at least
you have your head, unlike Piper.

21:54.664 --> 21:56.541
- What?
- Yeah, the Horseman got her.

21:56.791 --> 21:59.510
But, you know, she's doing pretty
good, considering the circumstances.

21:59.794 --> 22:01.591
A little grumpier
than normal, but hey...

22:01.838 --> 22:04.147
Anyway, you really should
get out of here before, you know,

22:04.424 --> 22:05.618
you get chopped.

22:08.637 --> 22:10.867
- I think I should stay here.
- Why?

22:11.140 --> 22:14.576
Because Gideon put me
on this path for a reason.

22:14.890 --> 22:16.528
And I believe that
there are answers here.

22:18.436 --> 22:22.315
I'll be okay. And you know where
to find me if you need me.

22:24.026 --> 22:29.054
Okay, but remember
that she's a suspect too.

22:35.913 --> 22:37.790
Ready to try again?

22:41.208 --> 22:44.723
- What's that? Who is that?
- Don't worry, it's just me,

22:45.046 --> 22:47.116
and some of the more
unusual suspects.

22:47.798 --> 22:50.392
Wait, you think one of us
is responsible?

22:50.676 --> 22:52.314
What, you didn't know
she thought that?

22:52.554 --> 22:54.670
What kind of telepath
are you anyway?

22:54.932 --> 22:57.969
- Stop picking on me!
- Yeah, or what?

22:58.268 --> 23:00.987
All right, guys, knock it off.
You're in my house.

23:01.272 --> 23:05.060
The Halliwell manor. I don't believe it.
It's just like in the text.

23:05.399 --> 23:06.593
Yeah.

23:06.816 --> 23:08.534
It looks like my grandma's house.

23:08.776 --> 23:10.607
All right, all right,
move it along, people.

23:10.863 --> 23:12.182
Let's go, other room.

23:20.247 --> 23:23.717
- All right, is everybody here?
- Yes, ma'am.

23:24.043 --> 23:26.955
- Kiss-ass!
- Hey, watch your mouth.

23:27.256 --> 23:30.885
- Whoa, it's Piper Halliwell.
- Yeah, but only part of her.

23:31.591 --> 23:33.946
- And not the good part either.
- Slick.

23:34.218 --> 23:38.336
- Can it!
- Okay, here's the deal, people.

23:38.973 --> 23:42.329
We know that one of you
is behind this.

23:42.644 --> 23:48.321
So nobody is gonna leave here
until we figure out who it is.

23:50.903 --> 23:55.055
- So far, nobody has gotten killed...
- Not yet anyway.

23:55.407 --> 24:00.037
And so far, this has just been
a really stupid prank.

24:00.411 --> 24:04.120
So please, let's not let it go
any further than that.

24:04.458 --> 24:06.176
Is Gideon gonna shut down
the school?

24:07.419 --> 24:08.818
Not unless he's forced to.

24:09.046 --> 24:10.877
Why don't you start
with the conjurer?

24:11.131 --> 24:13.008
Me? What about you, Quinton?

24:13.257 --> 24:16.010
- You're the Sleepy Hollow buff.
- But Slick's the shape-shifter.

24:16.303 --> 24:18.737
- Hey, screw you, Zachary.
- Wait, just stop it...

24:19.015 --> 24:21.654
- Why not just admit that you did it?
- I would never do anything

24:21.931 --> 24:23.125
to harm a Charmed One.

24:23.349 --> 24:26.341
- I'll be right back.
- Where are you going?

24:26.644 --> 24:28.794
- I wasn't talking to you!
- Paige!

24:33.444 --> 24:36.083
- What are you doing here?
- I need your help.

24:36.364 --> 24:38.002
My help?
That's rich, with what you pulled.

24:38.239 --> 24:40.912
Listen, I have enough juvenile
delinquents to take care of. Thanks.

24:41.202 --> 24:44.239
Please, just hear me out.
I'm running out of time.

24:44.539 --> 24:46.530
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Exactly that.

24:46.789 --> 24:49.303
Don't you see? That's the only reason
why I went to the demon.

24:49.918 --> 24:53.274
He can scan for evil. And maybe
figure out who's gonna turn Wyatt,

24:53.589 --> 24:56.626
- since we haven't been able to.
- Okay, you're not making any sense.

24:57.133 --> 25:00.205
Paige, listen to me.
I need you to trust me.

25:00.512 --> 25:02.946
And I need you to get
Piper and Leo to trust me too.

25:04.724 --> 25:06.476
Before it's too late.

25:07.103 --> 25:08.980
- The Headless Horseman!
- Paige!

25:09.230 --> 25:10.868
What happened?

25:15.400 --> 25:17.277
Are you okay?

25:26.369 --> 25:28.200
Everyone all right?

25:28.539 --> 25:30.257
I think so.

25:30.708 --> 25:32.266
Head count.

25:32.502 --> 25:35.938
No jokes, just do it.
What are you doing here?

25:36.757 --> 25:39.396
- Just trying to help.
- They're all here.

25:40.634 --> 25:43.626
I heard the alarm.
What's this doing open?

25:43.929 --> 25:45.999
A student must have
opened it without my seeing it.

25:46.266 --> 25:49.099
- And the Horseman?
- Gone, out those doors.

25:51.729 --> 25:54.197
- You have to stop him.
- Okay, well, we have to figure out...

25:54.481 --> 25:55.994
No, you don't understand.

25:56.232 --> 25:59.861
People on the outside aren't protected
like we are at school.

26:00.321 --> 26:01.310
They'll die.

26:02.322 --> 26:04.756
- Then we need Phoebe.
- I'll get her.

26:06.366 --> 26:08.084
But you can't wait for her.

26:08.327 --> 26:09.919
You have to go after
the Horseman now.

26:10.998 --> 26:13.432
By myself?
No, I can't vanquish him.

26:13.750 --> 26:15.149
You don't have to.

26:15.377 --> 26:17.413
All you have to do is lead him
back to the school

26:17.671 --> 26:19.627
so that at least nobody
will be killed.

26:21.424 --> 26:26.373
Don't let your concerns about Richard
make you question yourself.

26:26.764 --> 26:29.278
You can do this. I'll help you.

26:37.190 --> 26:39.146
Where are you going?

26:39.609 --> 26:41.247
Don't give me that look.

26:41.485 --> 26:44.841
I still got a mouth,
I could turn you into a toad.

27:22.983 --> 27:26.134
- Well, at least we got him back.
- Not soon enough, I'm afraid.

27:26.445 --> 27:32.554
The death of an innocent
means the death of Magic School.

27:38.499 --> 27:41.650
I just don't understand why
the Horseman targeted him.

27:41.962 --> 27:44.840
I mean, and why did he pass up
so many others along the way?

27:45.133 --> 27:48.250
Granted, it could have been a lot worse
but it doesn't change my mind.

27:48.550 --> 27:50.780
The police said he was a killer,
Gideon.

27:51.053 --> 27:52.725
- Doesn't make it right.
- No, it doesn't,

27:52.972 --> 27:55.042
but you shouldn't close
the school because of it.

27:55.307 --> 27:57.821
We have the Horseman contained.
We just need to find...

27:58.102 --> 28:00.616
It's too late. The damage
has already been done.

28:00.896 --> 28:04.252
When I started this school, I made
a promise, that the magic within

28:04.566 --> 28:06.761
would never harm a soul.

28:07.028 --> 28:08.746
Otherwise...

28:14.826 --> 28:17.260
- Piper, you okay?
- Hunky-dory.

28:19.707 --> 28:21.538
You, come with me.

28:25.462 --> 28:27.373
Anybody else want to try me?

28:29.341 --> 28:31.935
- Leo!
- What do you want him for?

28:32.220 --> 28:35.576
- Reinforcements.
- What's going on?

28:35.890 --> 28:37.642
Talk him out of closing
down the Magic School.

28:37.889 --> 28:40.198
Someone let the Horseman out, Leo.
He killed a man.

28:40.476 --> 28:41.545
But why?

28:41.768 --> 28:43.998
Why else? To force my hand.

28:44.272 --> 28:48.060
If you let whoever is behind this win,
all those kids are gonna lose.

28:48.401 --> 28:50.835
- Is that what you want?
- Of course not.

28:51.112 --> 28:52.306
- But...
- But what?

28:52.530 --> 28:54.680
Big deal, you have one bad apple.

28:54.949 --> 28:58.305
Just give us the time to flush him out,
to save the next generations of magic.

28:58.619 --> 29:01.929
- I know, but the rules...
- Screw the rules! Listen,

29:02.249 --> 29:05.446
you are the one who talked me into
doing this, you are the one who said

29:05.751 --> 29:08.060
I could do it.
So don't give up on me now, please.

29:10.381 --> 29:13.293
Just let us finish the job
that we started.

29:15.636 --> 29:17.035
Tell him, Leo.

29:18.515 --> 29:20.107
I think you just did.

29:28.397 --> 29:30.752
Next time, I give you warts.

29:33.194 --> 29:36.152
Hey, who did that?

29:37.781 --> 29:40.056
Where did you come from?

29:40.326 --> 29:43.124
Hey. Hey, wait... Hey!

29:48.252 --> 29:51.449
Piper? Oh, my God, Piper!

29:51.965 --> 29:54.638
- The door is still closed.
- The kids are frozen.

29:54.923 --> 29:57.357
- Piper must have done that.
- Without hands? I don't think so.

29:57.634 --> 30:00.785
- Someone from the outside?
- Impossible, we got here too fast.

30:01.348 --> 30:03.578
- It has to be one of them.
- The students? No,

30:03.849 --> 30:06.921
they don't possess that kind
of power. Besides, they're frozen.

30:07.228 --> 30:08.866
Then one of them is faking it.

30:15.528 --> 30:18.565
Okay, you know what?
Enough already.

30:18.865 --> 30:20.457
Every journey requires a sacrifice.

30:20.697 --> 30:23.609
My whole life is about sacrifice.
If that's all that my future holds,

30:23.910 --> 30:26.344
- then I don't want to see it.
- You're fighting it.

30:26.622 --> 30:28.260
Don't.

30:29.792 --> 30:32.226
Don't use your powers
to get through.

30:32.503 --> 30:35.063
They're not working
very well anyway.

30:35.715 --> 30:39.344
Just let it come to you.
Want it more than anything.

31:42.320 --> 31:45.153
Wyatt, let your little brother play
with the game too, please.

31:45.448 --> 31:46.483
Little brother?

31:47.033 --> 31:49.866
Hey, Piper, can you take Phoebe
to the doctor instead?

31:50.161 --> 31:52.914
I have so many papers to grade.
Thank you.

31:53.206 --> 31:55.356
- The doctor?
- Yeah, we need to make sure

31:55.626 --> 31:57.696
our little niece is doing okay.

32:01.714 --> 32:04.751
Aunt Phoebe, we need your help.

32:10.223 --> 32:11.372
Phoebe, can you hear me?

32:13.434 --> 32:14.628
We need your help.

32:18.481 --> 32:20.199
You okay?

32:22.945 --> 32:24.742
I don't know.

32:25.447 --> 32:27.722
- Am I?
- You tell me.

32:27.988 --> 32:29.626
What did you see?

32:31.659 --> 32:35.652
I saw children and my child.

32:37.500 --> 32:40.378
And a life without demons...
Is that even possible?

32:40.670 --> 32:44.902
With your powers, you know
by now what is truth and what is not.

32:45.257 --> 32:47.373
Embrace those powers again.

32:47.635 --> 32:50.308
Embrace your path,
and it will lead you there.

32:53.222 --> 32:55.577
You don't know how much
you've given me.

32:56.434 --> 32:57.947
You should go.

32:58.185 --> 33:00.460
So you can use your powers
to help us save our school.

33:06.570 --> 33:09.960
Oh, Phoebe, so glad to see you.
I was worried.

33:10.281 --> 33:11.680
What's the matter? Didn't trust me?

33:11.908 --> 33:13.546
- Separate subject.
- How's Piper?

33:13.994 --> 33:16.189
- You're not gonna like it.
- She's been kidnapped.

33:16.455 --> 33:18.047
- What?
- That's the bad news.

33:18.288 --> 33:20.518
The good news is that she's here...

33:20.791 --> 33:22.110
Somewhere.

33:22.334 --> 33:25.770
Well, if one of the students took her,
I can't sense which one it is.

33:26.923 --> 33:28.879
Maybe I can.

33:29.133 --> 33:30.930
Thanks to your wolf.

33:40.228 --> 33:45.222
I can sense pain and anger...
A lot of anger.

33:46.148 --> 33:48.708
Wants revenge...
Do any of them hate the high school?

33:48.985 --> 33:52.182
Honey, they're teenagers,
they all hate the school.

33:52.489 --> 33:54.764
But he's a conjurer.

34:01.372 --> 34:04.170
No. It's not him.

34:04.460 --> 34:07.179
- But who's this guy?
- A telepath.

34:08.172 --> 34:12.007
Yeah, he's telepathing
a whole lot of rage right now.

34:12.801 --> 34:14.632
Well, look who just solved the case.

34:14.886 --> 34:16.558
- Zachary?
- Surprise.

34:18.723 --> 34:20.953
- What happened? Where did he go?
- That wasn't Zachary,

34:21.225 --> 34:24.262
- that was an astral projection.
- He doesn't have that power.

34:24.562 --> 34:26.757
No, but a teacher here does.

34:27.022 --> 34:29.172
And Herman's a conjurer,
and Piper can freeze.

34:29.442 --> 34:32.002
He's using his telepathy
to tap into other people's powers.

34:32.279 --> 34:34.031
Where's the real Zachary?

34:34.281 --> 34:36.078
He's at school, with Piper.

34:36.321 --> 34:38.437
But why?
What does he want with her?

34:41.911 --> 34:43.425
You don't think he'll kill her, do you?

34:43.665 --> 34:45.337
You know what, I have no idea.

34:46.168 --> 34:50.081
He's a smart kid.
I just hope he's not luring us here.

35:05.559 --> 35:09.837
You made me do this, you know.
I didn't have a choice.

35:13.694 --> 35:16.447
So now what are you guys
gonna do?

35:22.870 --> 35:25.748
So whose bright idea
was this anyway?

35:26.040 --> 35:27.632
We were trying to save you.

35:27.873 --> 35:30.103
Yeah. Good job on that one.

35:30.375 --> 35:32.491
And who went
and got her head stolen?

35:32.754 --> 35:36.383
While you were off contemplating
your navel. While you still had one.

35:36.716 --> 35:38.832
Guys, we are not getting
anywhere arguing.

35:39.093 --> 35:42.290
Actually, we're not "getting anywhere"
because we don't have any bodies.

35:42.598 --> 35:44.190
Okay, look, we said we were sorry.

35:44.432 --> 35:46.821
Can we try looking on the bright side?
I mean, you know,

35:47.103 --> 35:49.014
- we're still alive.
- Only because Zachary...

35:49.271 --> 35:51.831
...can't kill us in here.
- I don't think he would if he could.

35:52.105 --> 35:53.743
I mean, he practically
apologised to us.

35:53.981 --> 35:56.541
I think she's right, actually.
I didn't sense any anger from him,

35:56.818 --> 35:59.810
- just a lot of sorrow.
- So, what,

36:00.114 --> 36:03.106
he did this to us just to get us
out of the way? To do what?

36:03.408 --> 36:06.798
- To get revenge on the school.
- And Gideon.

36:10.499 --> 36:12.455
How could I not have seen this?

36:12.711 --> 36:14.702
How could I not
have sensed his pain?

36:14.964 --> 36:16.397
After all these years with him.

36:16.632 --> 36:19.430
It's not your fault, Gideon.
Even you can't see everything.

36:19.716 --> 36:21.593
I should have seen this.

36:21.843 --> 36:26.712
I should have focused more
on the boy than on his magic.

36:28.642 --> 36:31.031
- Get the kids out of here now.
- Why, what's the matter?

36:31.310 --> 36:34.029
It's Zachary, he's lost it.

36:34.313 --> 36:37.464
Orb them out, up there.
I'll try talking to him.

36:39.069 --> 36:41.060
Just go.

36:46.325 --> 36:47.997
You should leave too.

36:48.494 --> 36:52.043
Why? After all, I came here for you.

36:57.337 --> 36:59.168
Do you think this spell's gonna work?

36:59.423 --> 37:02.176
Well, now that we know
who conjured the Horseman, it should.

37:02.467 --> 37:06.221
We won't know until we summon him,
so let's just put our heads together...

37:07.931 --> 37:09.250
You know what I mean, right?

37:23.779 --> 37:24.814
Okay, now, now, now!

37:25.030 --> 37:28.306
<i>Power of three, unite!
End this grizzly fright</i>

37:28.617 --> 37:31.051
<i>Reverse the roles
And make us whole</i>

37:43.172 --> 37:45.561
Thank God, it worked.

37:49.137 --> 37:51.651
You want me to get you a room?

37:52.223 --> 37:53.576
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

37:58.898 --> 38:02.811
Why take it out on others, Zachary?
Why not just come after me?

38:03.150 --> 38:04.788
Because I want you to suffer,
Gideon.

38:05.026 --> 38:06.823
Like you made me suffer
ever since I got here.

38:07.071 --> 38:10.859
I want you to see your precious
school destroyed. Bit by bit.

38:11.199 --> 38:13.793
But that doesn't give you the right
to kill an innocent.

38:14.077 --> 38:16.386
You scolding me now?
You're gonna give me a demerit?

38:18.040 --> 38:21.999
That wasn't supposed to happen.
I just wanted the sisters out of the way.

38:22.338 --> 38:24.010
The Horseman's only
supposed to hurt evil.

38:24.256 --> 38:25.769
Evil?

38:27.966 --> 38:30.355
You think teachers are evil?

38:30.635 --> 38:32.751
They are when they keep me here
against my wishes!

38:33.014 --> 38:35.323
And they take me away
from my family, my home!

38:35.599 --> 38:37.555
Without even thinking
about what I want!

38:37.809 --> 38:40.607
- Why didn't you come to me?
- I did, damn it!

38:40.896 --> 38:41.885
Every time I snuck out.

38:42.105 --> 38:44.744
Every time I got in trouble.
But you didn't care.

38:45.025 --> 38:47.016
- You wouldn't listen!
- We're listening.

38:48.446 --> 38:50.038
It's okay, we're not gonna hurt you.

38:51.237 --> 38:52.875
- We're here to help.
- How'd you get out?

38:53.114 --> 38:54.308
Magic.

38:55.075 --> 38:57.987
See, sometimes it takes us away
from our lives as well.

38:58.288 --> 39:00.119
A lot more than we like it to.

39:00.373 --> 39:02.170
But it's who we are
whether we like it or not.

39:02.417 --> 39:05.489
We can't change that
and neither can you.

39:05.796 --> 39:07.593
You have to accept it.

39:09.466 --> 39:13.345
You have to realise this is not
worth throwing your life away for.

39:15.806 --> 39:17.444
Just let it go.

39:20.474 --> 39:22.988
That's it. Easy...

39:32.280 --> 39:35.113
- You okay?
- Yes.

39:35.449 --> 39:40.398
I just guess I've been more invisible
than I realised over the years.

40:59.279 --> 41:00.314
Hey, guys.

41:00.530 --> 41:01.565
Wasn't Ziggy Marley

41:01.781 --> 41:05.012
- supposed to play here before?
- Yeah, he had to reschedule.

41:05.328 --> 41:06.681
So how's Zachary?

41:06.914 --> 41:09.348
He's good.
He's at home with his family now.

41:09.625 --> 41:13.254
But I wouldn't be surprised to see him
back at Magic School someday.

41:13.587 --> 41:17.705
I think he heard us, you know,
about accepting himself.

41:18.050 --> 41:21.440
- So you're not gonna bind his powers?
- No, he didn't want me to.

41:21.762 --> 41:26.392
But he gave me a good idea about
maybe doing that for somebody else.

41:27.474 --> 41:28.827
- Richard?
- Yeah.

41:29.058 --> 41:31.618
You know, if he can't handle it,
why should he have to?

41:32.397 --> 41:35.548
Maybe I can finally help him
accept that.

41:35.858 --> 41:38.930
You're gonna make a really good
teacher one day, Paige.

41:39.612 --> 41:41.807
- Teacher?
- Yes, in Magic School.

41:42.406 --> 41:45.478
I saw it with my very own...

41:45.786 --> 41:46.821
...vision.

41:47.913 --> 41:51.667
Yeah, well, I don't think she's gonna be
teaching Wyatt any time soon.

41:51.998 --> 41:55.877
Suddenly I'm more concerned about
separating him from his family

41:56.211 --> 41:57.724
than raising him as an only child.

41:57.964 --> 42:02.640
Actually, there might be a day that you
don't have to be concerned about that.

42:03.010 --> 42:04.489
What do you mean?

42:07.848 --> 42:09.076
I'm just saying.

42:09.934 --> 42:11.526
What are you just saying?

42:11.769 --> 42:12.963
Excuse me!

42:17.898 --> 42:19.172
Hey.

42:20.776 --> 42:22.050
Hey.

42:23.405 --> 42:24.758
So did you come here
to kick me out?

42:24.988 --> 42:27.661
No, actually, I came here
to ask you a question.

42:27.950 --> 42:28.939
What?

42:29.952 --> 42:32.068
I need you to be honest with me.

42:32.329 --> 42:35.446
No games, no running away.

42:35.751 --> 42:37.867
Just the truth.

42:39.630 --> 42:40.745
Okay.

42:43.340 --> 42:45.695
Are you Wyatt's little brother?

42:53.684 --> 42:56.198
Only if I can get Piper and Leo
back together in time.
