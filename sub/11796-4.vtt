<i>* When I wake up in the</i>

<i>gives out a warning</i>

00:06.373 --> 00:09.209
   <i>* I don't think</i>
   <i>I'll ever make it on time</i>

00:09.242 --> 00:12.178

00:21.354 --> 00:24.691

  Zack's voice:
 <i>I am in love, really in love.</i>

01:22.315 --> 01:25.151
<i>Check out those lines,</i>
<i>those curves.</i>

01:25.185 --> 01:29.155
   <i>Have you ever seen anything</i>
   <i>as beautiful as this</i>

01:29.189 --> 01:31.825
 <i>'66 Mustang?</i>

01:39.566 --> 01:42.469
 Lisa, get off the phone,
 it's for business calls only.

01:42.502 --> 01:45.205
 Boys are my business, honey.

01:47.340 --> 01:48.675
  ( scoffs )

01:48.708 --> 01:52.312
Don't forget who got you
this job, Miss Snippy.

01:52.345 --> 01:56.182
 Good morning,
 beautiful women of the '90s.

01:56.216 --> 01:58.251
- What's with him?
- He's in love.

01:58.284 --> 02:00.253
 But I think
 she's a hunk of junk.

02:00.286 --> 02:02.655
 Screech, that's an awfully
 piggish thing to say.

02:02.689 --> 02:05.358
   It's true, even with
   her top down I
   wasn't thrilled.

02:05.392 --> 02:07.360
 What?

02:07.394 --> 02:09.395
   You guys are disgusting.

02:09.429 --> 02:11.931
   Relax, Curly,
   he's talking about a car.

02:11.965 --> 02:15.935
  Not just any car...
  a '66 Mustang convertible.

02:15.969 --> 02:19.305
  Good luck,
  Preppie, I've gotta work.
  The lifeguard tower calls.

02:19.339 --> 02:23.309
l've got lives to save.
Hopefully pretty ones.

02:23.343 --> 02:26.413
And l've gotta make a deal
on a '66 dream machine.

02:26.446 --> 02:28.515
 Touch this phone
 and you die.

02:28.548 --> 02:31.217
Okay, l'll use my own.

02:31.251 --> 02:34.087
  Zack, you're late for work,
  my father's looking for you

02:34.087 --> 02:36.690
  - and he's hungry.
  - What else is new?

02:41.761 --> 02:45.098
   Good morning,
   Mr. Greasy, sir.

02:45.098 --> 02:47.567
   It's Carosi with a C
   and you better
   have my breakfast

02:47.600 --> 02:49.803
  or you're fired with an F.

02:49.836 --> 02:52.005
 Okay.

02:56.776 --> 03:00.814
<i>Bon appetit,</i> my leader.

03:00.847 --> 03:04.250
 Those eggs were overdone,
 l'll get you some better ones.

03:10.357 --> 03:12.659
 ( cell phone rings )

03:12.692 --> 03:14.661
   - Hello?
   - Hello,

03:14.694 --> 03:17.697
l'm calling about
the Mustang for sale.
How much is it?

03:17.731 --> 03:21.468
   A steal at $2006.52,
   not a penny less.

03:21.501 --> 03:23.703
That's a lot of money
for an old car.

03:23.737 --> 03:25.839
  I know. I'll take cash
  or certified check.

03:25.872 --> 03:30.110
  l'd like to test drive it
  first, but my jerk of a boss
  won't let me off early.

03:30.143 --> 03:33.713
  I know how those guys can be.
  Why don't you
  stop by after work?

03:33.747 --> 03:35.849
 The name's Carosi,
 Leon Carosi.

03:35.882 --> 03:37.784
   - Carosi?
   - Morris?

03:37.817 --> 03:40.520
 Morris, is that you?

03:43.890 --> 03:46.526
Oo-ooh, would you like
a refill, sir?

03:46.559 --> 03:48.962
- Nice day. Nice shirt.
- Nice try.

03:48.995 --> 03:53.199
 This jerk of a boss is not
 gonna lower the price of that
 car one red cent.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.735
  1500 is all I can afford.
  Please, sir?

03:55.769 --> 03:57.537
Pretty please?

03:57.570 --> 03:59.472
  No.

03:59.506 --> 04:01.808
 But keep begging, I enjoy it.

04:11.885 --> 04:13.887
 Look what the tide dragged in.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.555
 Why don't you stay
 at your own beach club, Monty?

04:16.589 --> 04:19.726
  l'm here to make
  our annual volleyball bet.

04:19.759 --> 04:23.697
  Unless you're afraid
  North Beach will
  wipe you out again?

04:23.730 --> 04:26.633
  Your club was just lucky
  the last 10 years.

04:27.801 --> 04:31.671
   Well then,
   we'll bet the usual $500.

04:31.705 --> 04:34.574
 No bets,
 we're not playing this year.

04:34.607 --> 04:36.876
  ls chicken on today's menu?

04:37.911 --> 04:40.547
 Excuse me, sir?
 May I speak to you privately?

04:40.580 --> 04:43.616
I told you I'm not lowering
the price of
that car, get lost.

04:43.650 --> 04:46.619
It's about
the volleyball match.
You could win.

04:46.653 --> 04:49.656
   What? Are you dizzy
   as well as dopey?

04:49.689 --> 04:51.958
 - We don't have a decent team.
 - You do this year.

04:51.991 --> 04:55.829
  Kelly is captain of the
  volleyball team and Slater's
  All City in four sports.

04:55.862 --> 04:59.866
 And Jessie and I
 are really good
 and we're undefeated.

04:59.899 --> 05:01.801
 Are you sure?

05:03.737 --> 05:06.673
   The bet's on, big mouth.

05:08.641 --> 05:12.345
Slater: Zack, how could you
tell Carosi that
we're undefeated?

05:12.379 --> 05:14.681
  Well...
  we haven't lost to anyone.

05:14.714 --> 05:16.950
- We haven't played anyone.
- See?

05:17.050 --> 05:20.620
   Guys, this is the perfect
   opportunity to make Carosi
   treat us better.

05:20.653 --> 05:24.591
   We've got him over a barrel,
   just let me handle this.

05:25.625 --> 05:26.926
How's my team?

05:26.960 --> 05:31.698
 - Ready to beat
 North Beach on Sunday?
 - Well, that depends.

05:31.731 --> 05:34.067
   Depends? On what?

05:34.067 --> 05:36.169
 On what you might do for us.

05:36.202 --> 05:38.471
   We scratch your back,
   you scratch ours.

05:38.505 --> 05:41.875
  Would someone scratch mine?
  l've got a mosquito bite
  that's driving me nutty.

05:41.908 --> 05:43.910
   - Ooh, ooh.
   - Better?

05:43.943 --> 05:48.181
 Morris, I bet North Beach $500
 'cause you said
 your team could win.

05:48.214 --> 05:49.849
I know.

05:49.883 --> 05:52.152
Okay, I see your game.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.921
 You can have
 afternoons off for practice.

05:54.954 --> 05:58.091
   All right!
   I mean that's important.

05:58.091 --> 06:00.226
  - Now win.
  - Nah, nah, nah...

06:00.260 --> 06:04.064
  not so fast, Mr. Crotchety.

06:04.097 --> 06:09.069
   lf you win your bet, you can
   sell me your
   car for $500 less.

06:09.102 --> 06:11.938
- No way.
- Then you lose again.

06:12.038 --> 06:15.508
 - What is it,
 11 years in a row?
 - This is blackmail.

06:15.542 --> 06:18.244
 All right, 1800
 and not a penny less.

06:18.278 --> 06:20.480
 1 200 and a full tank of gas.

06:20.513 --> 06:22.549
  1650 and buy your own gas.

06:22.582 --> 06:26.286
 1500, Leon,
 and not a penny more.

06:26.319 --> 06:27.887
 Deal.

06:27.921 --> 06:30.190
  And you have to be nice
  to us from now on.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.826
A little change
in your
attitude wouldn't hurt,

06:32.859 --> 06:36.296
 Mr.
 Fancy-Pants-Big-Shot-Boss-Man.

06:36.329 --> 06:40.066
 Okay, everybody
 get back to work now.

06:40.066 --> 06:42.802
I haven't heard
the magic word.

06:43.803 --> 06:45.939
Please.

06:53.279 --> 06:57.384
   So this is the great team
   l've been hearing about.

06:57.417 --> 07:00.653
 Screech: Yeah, we're gonna
 win by 10 touchdowns.

07:00.687 --> 07:03.156
   Oh, that makes me
   feel much better.

07:03.189 --> 07:06.593
   Stacy,
   Stacy, don't worry about it.
   We have it under control.

07:06.626 --> 07:10.030
 I pity the team
 that has to play us.

07:11.331 --> 07:14.334
  Oh, no,
  the bozo brothers are back.

07:14.367 --> 07:16.236
   Stacy,
   what are you doing here?

07:16.269 --> 07:19.372
You told me you were moving
to Africa to be
with your dying aunt.

07:19.406 --> 07:22.242
   She recovered.
   It was a miracle.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.244
  Okay? Bye.

07:24.277 --> 07:27.681
Stacy, aren't you gonna
introduce us to
your boyfriend?

07:27.714 --> 07:30.950
   - He's not my boyfriend.
   - ( guy scoffs )

07:31.051 --> 07:32.152
 Yet.

07:32.185 --> 07:36.356
These amoebas
are Tad and Ted Pogue.

07:36.389 --> 07:40.193
  They're so California.
  They play for North Beach.

07:40.226 --> 07:43.196
 Screech: Meet the team
 that's gonna cream you guys.

07:43.229 --> 07:45.231
  Really? Do you wanna
  hit a few or what?

07:45.265 --> 07:47.300
   - Us against you guys.
   - You're kidding.

07:47.334 --> 07:50.437
  Okay, give you a little taste
  of what you're up against.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.972
 Okay, remember
 our strategy... win!

07:53.073 --> 07:55.275
 - Zack: Yeah!
 - Slater: Let's do it!
 Let's do it!

07:58.445 --> 08:01.381
   Zack: Kelly!
   Yeah, all right!

08:06.052 --> 08:08.355
  Screech:
  I got it! I got it!

08:09.389 --> 08:11.725
  Hey, Screech, are you okay?

08:11.758 --> 08:15.261
   l'm fine, Kelly.
   Football's a tough game.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.331
   Screech!

08:24.137 --> 08:27.073
I knew my father was crazy
to believe in you guys.

08:27.107 --> 08:29.776
  I should warn him so he could
  try to get out of this bet.

08:29.809 --> 08:33.145
 The game isn't till next week.
 We'll win, I promise.

08:33.179 --> 08:36.049
You're crazy,
you're never
gonna beat those guys.

08:36.049 --> 08:40.553
   Stacy, give us a chance.
   Zack's pulled off crazier
   things than this.

08:40.587 --> 08:43.556
  Okay, l'll give you one day
  to come up with something,

08:43.590 --> 08:45.859
or l'll have to
tell my father.

08:45.892 --> 08:48.194
( Zack sighs )

08:52.565 --> 08:55.602
  - ( sighs )
  - Oh, man.

08:55.635 --> 08:58.905
So, Preppie,
you got any ideas yet?

08:58.938 --> 09:02.475
  Yeah, just one...
  pray for a miracle.

09:02.509 --> 09:04.511
 Hey.

09:04.544 --> 09:07.881
   Excuse me, l'm looking for
   this hot-looking
   lifeguard that works here.

09:07.914 --> 09:09.616
  You mean the great-looking,

09:09.649 --> 09:12.318
   unattached,
   dying-for-a-boyfriend
   brunette.

09:12.352 --> 09:14.554
 Yeah, do you know
 where she is?

09:14.587 --> 09:16.856
   - Uh...
   - Maybe.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.426
   - How tall are you?
   - 6'10".

09:21.094 --> 09:23.530
  Somebody up there loves me.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.265
Can you get me
a date with her?

09:25.298 --> 09:28.535
  It depends...
  you play volleyball?

09:28.568 --> 09:30.537
   Screech!

09:30.570 --> 09:32.339
  You barked?

09:32.372 --> 09:35.208
  This coffee's cold
  and these rolls are stale.

09:35.241 --> 09:38.211
- You told me to
serve them anyway.
- Not to me, you twit.

09:38.244 --> 09:42.349
  - To the employees.
  - You work here,
  you're an employee.

09:42.382 --> 09:45.318
  I own the place,
  that makes me an employer.

09:45.352 --> 09:47.687
   Well, smell you!

09:47.721 --> 09:50.557
Didn't your mother
teach you any manners?

09:50.590 --> 09:53.593
 - ( growls )
 - Uh, uh, uh...
 remember volleyball.

09:53.626 --> 09:57.263
  I remember and
  stop touching me...
  get back, get away!

09:57.297 --> 10:01.001
   Didn't you hear
   that fat people
   are supposed to be jolly?

10:03.603 --> 10:06.806
  What's up, Screech?

10:06.840 --> 10:09.175
 - Excuse me, Mr. Caloocci.
 - It's Carosi.

10:09.209 --> 10:11.311
  I have a small,
  but important favor to ask.

10:11.344 --> 10:12.679
  Forget it.

10:12.712 --> 10:14.748
  You'll change your mind
  once you meet him.

10:14.781 --> 10:16.783
 - Meet who?
 - Gary Lucas.

10:16.816 --> 10:19.686
I hired him,
I thought
the club could use him.

10:19.719 --> 10:22.255
You have no authority
to hire anyone.

10:22.288 --> 10:24.691
  Oh, that's too bad.

10:24.724 --> 10:28.161
 I guess we're
 gonna have to kick
 Gary off the volleyball team.

10:28.194 --> 10:31.264
   What a shame,
   you should see
   him spike a ball.

10:31.297 --> 10:32.832
  Look, I...

10:34.100 --> 10:36.436
  You sure are tall, kid...
  Gary.

10:36.469 --> 10:39.305
   Welcome to the Malibu Sands.
   Have a seat, son.

10:39.339 --> 10:41.875
- Have a roll?
- Thanks, I love rolls.

10:41.908 --> 10:43.343
 Have a dozen.

10:44.811 --> 10:47.180
 I was thinking, sir. Maybe you
 ought to double that bet
 with North Beach.

10:47.213 --> 10:52.452
 l'm gonna triple it. It looks
 like you might get
 my Mustang after all.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.854
   - Hi, Zack.
   - Hey,
   Gary, Gary this is Kelly,

10:54.888 --> 10:56.956
 Kelly, this is Gary.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.926
- Hi.
- Yes, you are.

10:59.959 --> 11:02.429
 Being tall has its advantages.

11:02.462 --> 11:04.330
 The air's much better up here

11:04.364 --> 11:06.533
and l'm the first one
to know when it rains.

11:06.566 --> 11:08.335
 - Cute.
 - So are you.

11:08.368 --> 11:10.904
  Matter of fact,
  you're the prettiest
  girl on the beach.

11:10.937 --> 11:13.206
I can see all the way
from here to San Diego.

11:13.239 --> 11:15.875
  - Gary,
  I bet you're a great net man.
  - The best.

11:15.909 --> 11:19.546
 - Let's practice volleyball!
   Let's go!
 - Slater: Let's do it, do it!

11:19.579 --> 11:21.581
   That includes you, Spano.

11:21.614 --> 11:24.384
 Put that sissy water down
 and get on the court.

11:24.417 --> 11:26.886
Now, now, now!

11:29.289 --> 11:31.925
 Kelly:
 All right, let's go.

11:38.298 --> 11:39.532
  Zack:
  Here you go, Gary.

11:39.566 --> 11:41.601
   ( Zack cheering )

11:47.007 --> 11:51.611
   Slater: All right, Gary,
   that was a nice job,
   good serve.

11:51.644 --> 11:54.614
  - Stacy: Who is this guy?
  - It's our newest
  member of our team.

11:54.647 --> 11:57.484
   I told you I had a plan.

11:57.517 --> 12:00.053
  How are you two kids doing?

12:00.053 --> 12:02.389
  Zack, I am so glad
  you introduced me to Gary.

12:02.422 --> 12:05.458
 l'm getting
 a stiff neck looking
 at him, but he's real sweet.

12:05.492 --> 12:07.927
Enough,
when is the first date?

12:07.961 --> 12:09.963
We're going
to the movies tonight.

12:10.063 --> 12:14.067
  Gary, you sly dog.
  Yes, buddy!

12:15.402 --> 12:17.370
 How's my man stretch?

12:17.404 --> 12:20.373
 I can't wait to watch him bury
 North Beach's volleyball team.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.509
   ln a few days, sir,
   we'll both have our wish.

12:22.542 --> 12:24.678
   I just hope mine's
   waxed and gassed.

12:24.711 --> 12:26.713
   No problem, son.

12:26.746 --> 12:29.516
 Thanks to you, I suckered
 Monty into tripling the bet.

12:29.549 --> 12:32.185
Remember,
don't just beat 'em...

12:32.218 --> 12:34.521
  crush 'em!

12:37.757 --> 12:40.126
  I hate to admit it, Zack,
  but you're good.

12:40.160 --> 12:42.829
  I haven't seen my
  father this happy
  since Mom remarried

12:42.862 --> 12:44.698
 and he stopped paying alimony.

12:44.731 --> 12:47.734
- Good,
can I have the day off?
- You're not that good.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.669
 Now get back to work.

12:49.703 --> 12:52.772
   Out of my way!
   Lady with a baby.

12:52.806 --> 12:54.207
  - Ow!
  - All: Oh!

12:54.240 --> 12:57.811
   - Oh, his foot!
   - Someone call a doctor.

13:03.049 --> 13:05.885
 Boy, Zack,
 you are one
 roller coaster ride.

13:05.919 --> 13:07.921
  First we can't win,
  then we can't lose,

13:07.954 --> 13:10.757
 and now with Gary injured,
 who even knows if we can play?

13:10.790 --> 13:13.893
 Okay, let's not panic.
 l'm sure it's nothing serious.

13:13.927 --> 13:18.098
  Lisa's mother is
  looking at Gary's foot
  and she is a great doctor.

13:18.131 --> 13:21.968
 She must be great,
 look how well his cast fits.

13:22.068 --> 13:24.471
 Jessie:
 Now is a good time to panic.

13:24.504 --> 13:27.173
- Stacy: Oh, no.
- Zack: Sit right here.

13:30.110 --> 13:32.479
   Well, guys, it's broken.

13:32.512 --> 13:35.081
  - ln two places.
  - Does this
  mean he can't play?

13:35.081 --> 13:39.953
- I can barely walk.
- Answer the question,
will you? Jeez.

13:39.986 --> 13:43.923
   Mr. Carosi...
   quick, hide Gary's foot.

13:43.957 --> 13:46.559
   Hurry up, hurry up,
   here he comes.
   Hide it, hide it.

13:46.593 --> 13:49.896
 ( Carosi whistling )

13:49.929 --> 13:52.966
- What's going on?
- Nothing,
we're just practicing.

13:52.999 --> 13:55.101
  It's called
  "lnner Volleyball."

13:55.101 --> 13:58.104
 We play the whole game
 in our minds.

13:58.104 --> 14:01.608
 - Okay, someone set me up.
 - I will, aim high.

14:01.641 --> 14:05.045
Okay, go for it. Spike!
All right!

14:05.045 --> 14:08.048
  - ( all cheering )
  - Our point. Good teamwork.

14:08.048 --> 14:09.482
 What are you doing down there?

14:09.516 --> 14:11.418
Nothing,
just hiding Gary's foot.

14:11.451 --> 14:13.253
 Oops.

14:13.286 --> 14:16.523
  - Why? What's wrong with it?
  - Nothing, it's just fine.

14:16.556 --> 14:20.193
  Ow!

14:20.226 --> 14:22.128
 Mr. Carosi...

14:22.162 --> 14:25.065
 - Gary is injured,
 he can't play.
 - I see that.

14:25.098 --> 14:28.068
   But we still
   have a great team,
   don't we? Stacy?

14:28.068 --> 14:30.170
 Uh...

14:30.203 --> 14:32.072
   maybe...

14:32.072 --> 14:33.340
   maybe...

14:33.373 --> 14:37.177
Maybe I overstated a bit
about how good we are,

14:37.210 --> 14:41.081
  like we're not... great,
  but we're definitely okay.

14:41.114 --> 14:44.150
  I bet a lot of money on you
  kids, 'cause you said
  you couldn't lose.

14:44.184 --> 14:46.986
   lf you don't win that match,
   you're all fired.

14:47.087 --> 14:50.790
  Okay, bub, this time
  you're way over
  the attitude line.

14:50.824 --> 14:54.394
   - ( growls )
   - Nice, boss, nice, nice.

15:01.034 --> 15:03.069
   Whose clothes are these?

15:03.103 --> 15:07.340
  Jessie's, who else?
  Around here she's the pig.

15:07.374 --> 15:10.043
   I'll pick everything up
   this weekend, I promise.

15:10.043 --> 15:12.379
Oh, no, no, no.
l'll get them.

15:12.412 --> 15:15.815
   Lisa... l'm so impressed
   that while we're
   living together

15:15.849 --> 15:18.318
 you're so accepting
 of my faults,

15:18.351 --> 15:21.354
   like leaving
   my clothes around and...

15:23.323 --> 15:27.627
 - What are you doing?
 - I just wanted to
 air them out for you.

15:28.695 --> 15:30.797
 Strong wind outside.

15:32.265 --> 15:35.402
  - Anyone need a blouse?
  - l'll take those.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.437
   Girls, we brought pizzas.

15:37.470 --> 15:41.141
  We might as well worry about
  the game with extra
  cheese and pepperoni.

15:41.174 --> 15:45.412
  We still have to figure out
  a way to win or we can
  kiss our jobs goodbye.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.714
  ( doorbell rings )

15:47.747 --> 15:49.816
 l'll get it.

15:49.849 --> 15:52.752
 Oh, it's me.

15:52.786 --> 15:55.422
 Great news, fellow
 and fell-ette volleyballers.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.691
I found these great
replacements for Gary.

15:57.724 --> 16:00.326
  You guys pick...
  first we have Eva.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.328
She's the best athlete
in her school.

16:02.362 --> 16:04.764
- Great, where does she go?
- UCLA?

16:04.798 --> 16:07.167
 - USC?
 - Near there.

16:09.235 --> 16:12.439
   Smiley Face Preschool.
   She's the tallest
   one in her class.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.808
Do I get my candy now?

16:14.841 --> 16:15.875
 Here.

16:16.743 --> 16:21.214
Screech,
we need a real athlete.

16:21.247 --> 16:23.883
  Yeah,
  and someone a little older.

16:23.917 --> 16:26.920
  I anticipated that.
  Meet lda May Ross.

16:26.953 --> 16:29.789
   She was on the US
   volleyball team.

16:30.857 --> 16:32.826
   When do I serve?

16:32.859 --> 16:35.228
Uh, Screech...

16:35.261 --> 16:37.397
I thought you said
she was on the US team.

16:37.430 --> 16:41.334
   She was in 1936.

16:41.368 --> 16:42.936
   And this is the
   best you could do?

16:42.969 --> 16:45.071
   Nope,
   I saved the best for last.

16:45.071 --> 16:47.474
Come on down, Big Pete.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.509
Zack: Big Pete.

16:50.877 --> 16:54.080
 Big... Pete?
 ( laughing )

16:54.080 --> 16:57.450
 Big Pete. All right, Big Pete,
 you play volleyball?

16:57.484 --> 17:01.888
  Just hand me a racket
  and point me to the court.

17:01.921 --> 17:05.825
   Screech, is Eva, lda
   and Big Pete it?

17:05.858 --> 17:10.063
   - There's nobody else.
   - Well, Big Pete,

17:10.096 --> 17:12.298
 I guess you're in.
 Welcome to the team.

17:12.332 --> 17:14.901
   Ow! l'm telling.

17:19.839 --> 17:23.910
  This is hopeless,
  there's no way we can win.

17:34.054 --> 17:37.390
  Ooh,
  here's a good job, Jessie.

17:37.424 --> 17:39.526
  Cleaning freeway graffiti?

17:39.559 --> 17:44.531
- You call that a good job?
- lf you stay away
from the cars, it is.

17:44.564 --> 17:47.100
   Here's one for you, Screech.
   Food taster.

17:47.133 --> 17:50.770
- Where?
- Happy Kitty Cat Food.

17:50.804 --> 17:53.206
I worked there last summer,
the food's great,

17:53.239 --> 17:55.842
 if you don't mind
 eating on your knees.

17:55.875 --> 17:59.612
 - What are you guys doing?
 - We're all looking
 for new summer jobs.

17:59.646 --> 18:02.082
 After tomorrow's
 volleyball game,
 we're gonna need 'em.

18:02.115 --> 18:05.652
Come on, I don't believe
you're giving up before
the game starts.

18:05.685 --> 18:07.120
 When should we give up, Kelly?

18:07.153 --> 18:09.723
 We're not giving up...
 hear me... ever.

18:09.756 --> 18:12.058
  You guys are not
  gonna believe this telegram

18:12.092 --> 18:14.094
  we got from
  those jerks at North Beach.

18:14.127 --> 18:15.729
   North Beach, huh?

18:15.762 --> 18:19.099
  - Maybe we can
  get a job there.
  - Listen to this...

18:19.132 --> 18:22.502
 "Dear Losers, We hope
 you can breathe underground,

18:22.535 --> 18:25.205
   because we're gonna bury you
   in the game tomorrow.

18:25.238 --> 18:27.640
 You stink.
 Your friends at North Beach."

18:27.674 --> 18:30.176
 Who do these guys
 think they're calling losers?

18:30.210 --> 18:32.579
  Are we gonna let them
  get away with that?

18:32.612 --> 18:35.115
Yes! I mean no.

18:35.148 --> 18:37.817
   Let's show them what
   we're made of, Big Pete.

18:39.719 --> 18:41.921
  That sounds like a team
  l'm proud to coach.

18:41.955 --> 18:44.691
  Let's go out there
 and practice,
  practice, practice.

18:44.724 --> 18:47.127
   - All: Yeah!
   - Kelly: Whoo, all right.

18:48.862 --> 18:52.732
 I'm really glad
 I sent this telegram.

19:12.686 --> 19:15.755
 I hope
 you're a good loser, Carosi.

19:25.331 --> 19:28.268
 Listen up, everyone.

19:28.301 --> 19:32.038
   Remember, when you're out
   there it's not how
   you play the game,

19:32.038 --> 19:35.108
   it's whether you work here
   next week or not.

19:35.141 --> 19:38.411
   Oh, yeah,
   thanks for the pep talk.

19:38.445 --> 19:41.448
  Referee:
  Teams take your positions.

19:41.481 --> 19:44.451
  Malibu Sands
  Club serves first.

19:44.484 --> 19:47.354
   ( whistle blows )

19:47.387 --> 19:50.256
  - Zack: ls everybody ready?!
  - Slater: Ready! Let's go!

19:50.290 --> 19:52.792
Not me.
My feet are killing me.

19:52.826 --> 19:56.262
 - All that
 practice gave me blisters.
 - Ooh, what...

19:56.296 --> 19:58.732
- Pete...
- We don't have
enough people to play.

19:58.765 --> 20:02.769
  - Great,
  we're gonna have to forfeit.
  - No, you won't. l'll play.

20:02.802 --> 20:05.438
   - Stacy? All right!
   - Stacy!

20:05.472 --> 20:08.441
  All right, let's do it.
  We've worked
  hard for this guys.

20:08.475 --> 20:09.843
   ( all cheering )

20:09.876 --> 20:13.079
 One, two, three, win!

20:18.184 --> 20:22.122
  Hey, babe.
  Wanna do yourself a favor
  and go out with me tonight?

20:22.155 --> 20:23.490
l'd love to...

20:23.523 --> 20:27.360
 but l'm relacing
 all my tennis shoes tonight.

20:32.465 --> 20:35.568
  ( crowd cheering )

20:35.602 --> 20:38.571
 Zack:
 Set it up,
 set it up, set it up.

20:38.605 --> 20:41.274
   ( crowd groans )

20:42.642 --> 20:45.211
   Got it, got it, got it...

20:45.245 --> 20:47.547
  Come on, teamwork!

20:51.584 --> 20:55.188
   - Kelly: Get it, get it!
   - I don't want it,
   I don't want it!

20:55.221 --> 20:57.924
   ( all cheering )

20:59.459 --> 21:02.429
It's all in the wrist.

21:10.203 --> 21:12.972
   ( all cheering )

21:14.574 --> 21:16.643
 Zack: Got it!

21:29.589 --> 21:31.091
 ( groaning )

21:36.396 --> 21:39.099
  ( crowd cheering )

21:51.478 --> 21:54.581
( cheering continues,
whistle blows )

22:01.087 --> 22:03.490
 Hey, Tad, I changed my mind.

22:03.523 --> 22:05.792
   l'd love to go out with
   a handsome guy
   like you tonight.

22:05.825 --> 22:07.293
 - Really?
 - ( grunts )

22:09.062 --> 22:12.265
 Nah, forget it.
 I don't date dweebs.

22:15.702 --> 22:17.570
 It's match point.
 Let's do it.

22:17.604 --> 22:19.806
- Here we go.
- Whoo!

22:19.839 --> 22:21.474
  Yeah! Let's do it.

22:21.508 --> 22:25.378
Come on, Zack,
this one's for the car.

22:45.465 --> 22:48.268
 ( cheering )

22:54.641 --> 22:56.409
  All right!

23:03.350 --> 23:07.153
  ( Instrumental music plays )
