01:25.353 --> 01:28.656
Hello, Mrs. J.
Do you have any
maraschino cherries?

01:28.722 --> 01:30.458
I think so, Mister Bentley.

01:30.524 --> 01:32.526
Oh, good. You see,
Valerie's coming over
for dinner tonight,

01:32.593 --> 01:34.262
and I'm mixing
her favorite drink.

01:34.328 --> 01:36.597
I call it After Five.

01:36.664 --> 01:38.732
What's After Five?

01:38.799 --> 01:42.436
I don't know. I've never
been able to get her
to drink more than four.

01:42.503 --> 01:44.205
Oh, I say,
what a stunning dress.

01:44.272 --> 01:46.106
I'm sure Mister J
will love it.

01:46.174 --> 01:48.209
Oh, do you think
it'll fit him?

01:48.276 --> 01:50.911
Well, I suppose if he takes
the hem up a little bit.

01:50.978 --> 01:52.313
Oh, did I say that? Oh my.

01:52.380 --> 01:54.382
I'm going to ask Florence
for the cherries.

01:54.448 --> 01:57.618
Oh, Florence isn't here.
She's visiting her aunt
for a few days.

Hello.

Oh, hello, Mister Wentworth.

02:08.929 --> 02:10.664
What?

02:10.731 --> 02:13.901
You want me to be in the play
at the Help Center?

02:14.802 --> 02:16.837
To replace Melinda?

02:16.904 --> 02:21.675
Oh, I couldn't.
She's a very beautiful
woman, and I...

02:23.411 --> 02:27.448
Oh, well. Thank you.

02:27.515 --> 02:31.252
Oh, well, um, how much
rehearsing time will there be?

02:31.319 --> 02:33.053
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:33.120 --> 02:37.491
But I just wouldn't feel right
leaving my husband alone
that many nights.

02:37.558 --> 02:39.993

for asking anyway.

02:43.564 --> 02:46.700
Oh, the Help Center's putting
on a play to raise money.

That was the director,
Mister Wentworth.

02:48.636 --> 02:50.070
He wanted me to play a part.

02:50.137 --> 02:51.639
Oh. What did you tell him?

02:51.705 --> 02:54.908
I said, no. I'd rather spend
my evenings with you.

02:54.975 --> 02:57.878
Of course you would.
He should have known that
in the first place.

the cherries, Mrs. J.

Hey, Bentley,
with all those cherries,

03:06.920 --> 03:08.256
you could make
a perfect gift pack.

Valerie has fun unwrapping me.

different about me?

the dress, didn't you?

-Nothing.

it would be fun

Look, Weezy, I can't go out.

go out on the town?

about this anymore.

Good, Weez, because I like
peace and quiet when I work.

04:31.805 --> 04:36.377
Well, I'm not going to be
quiet unless you take me out
to dinner and then dancing.

-But, Weezy, look...
-Oh, come on, George.
It'll be healthy for you.

don't take me out,

what I just saw.

he comes home,
woofs down his dinner,

08:46.760 --> 08:52.332
and changes from
a conservative businessman
into a disco duck.

08:52.399 --> 08:55.168
Who was the idiot who gave him
the idea to start discoing?

08:59.506 --> 09:00.841
Me.

Oh, I'm sorry, Louise.
I didn't mean that you're.

09:02.810 --> 09:05.746
Oh, that's okay, Tom.
It's my own fault.

09:05.813 --> 09:09.817
I told him
to stop working so much,
and get out and live.

09:09.883 --> 09:12.986
Hey, but maybe if we
went down there with you,

09:13.053 --> 09:14.788
we could try to talk him
out of it.

09:14.855 --> 09:16.423
Oh, Helen, would you?

09:16.489 --> 09:18.992
Hmm. You think he'd pay
any attention to us?

09:19.059 --> 09:21.528
Good point.
He never has before.

09:21.595 --> 09:25.065

you are my only hope.

to stop calling me "honky"

Hey.

14:11.618 --> 14:13.220
George, I wanna talk to you.

14:13.286 --> 14:15.055
Later, Weezy.
I gotta get a glass of milk.

14:15.122 --> 14:16.924
This discoing
makes me thirsty.

14:16.990 --> 14:18.625
But, George...

14:18.691 --> 14:22.963
-Helen, there's something
I want to say to you.
-Yes?

14:23.030 --> 14:24.131
Um...

14:25.765 --> 14:27.968
Can I get you
something to drink, too?

14:28.035 --> 14:30.603
-Tom.
-Huh? Oh, uh, uh, right.

14:30.670 --> 14:33.907
Helen, it's uh,
it's uh, just that,
it's just that I'm...

14:33.974 --> 14:35.642
Tired of sitting home alone?

14:35.708 --> 14:38.111
-Well, yes.
-And you want me
to quit dancing?

14:38.178 --> 14:40.413
-As a matter of fact, I do.
-Okay, I will.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.549
No, Helen, I've given this
a lot of thought and...

14:42.615 --> 14:43.616
You will?

14:43.683 --> 14:45.618
Do you really mean it, Helen?

14:45.685 --> 14:48.788
Louise, you're looking at
a lady who's discoed out.

14:48.855 --> 14:51.791
Honey, I ain't got
another hustle
left in my bustle.

14:53.293 --> 14:54.727
Tom, let's go.

14:54.794 --> 14:57.197
-Goodnight, Louise.
-Goodnight.

14:57.264 --> 15:00.968
You see, Louise,
just don't let yourself
get bossed around.

15:01.034 --> 15:03.870
HELEN: Tom, let's go!

15:03.937 --> 15:05.805
Oh, coming, sweetheart.

15:10.643 --> 15:13.013
George, I've got
a surprise for you.

15:13.080 --> 15:15.248
Good. I hope
it's a new disco shirt.

15:15.315 --> 15:17.084
No, you've lost your partner.

15:17.150 --> 15:18.952
Helen's given up disco.

15:19.019 --> 15:20.520
Why'd she wanna do
a dumb thing like that?

15:20.587 --> 15:22.622
She's rather
stay home with Tom.

15:22.689 --> 15:24.157
Now that is dumb.

15:24.224 --> 15:25.292
(LAUGHS)

15:25.358 --> 15:27.560
I thought that would
shake you up.

15:27.627 --> 15:30.197
-Well, I'll just have to find
another partner.
-What?

15:30.263 --> 15:31.764
Look, don't worry
about it, Weez.

15:31.831 --> 15:34.601
All the girls
down at Dirty Betty's
are standing in line

15:34.667 --> 15:36.803
to dance with Motor Hips.

15:41.074 --> 15:42.809
Motor Hips?

15:44.077 --> 15:45.612
That's me.

15:45.678 --> 15:48.848
George, I'm tired of sitting
home alone every night.

15:48.915 --> 15:50.483
Well, Weezy,
find something to do.

15:50.550 --> 15:51.951
Like what?

15:52.019 --> 15:54.954
Whatever you want.
Just do your own thing.

15:55.022 --> 15:56.456
My own thing?

15:56.523 --> 15:59.159
Like me. Disco is my thing,
and I'm doing it to death.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.296
George, is that all
you have to say?

16:03.363 --> 16:04.364
I'm afraid so, Weezy.

16:04.431 --> 16:05.865
I wish could stay up and talk,

16:05.932 --> 16:07.500
but I have to get some
rest for tomorrow night,

16:07.567 --> 16:09.969
because Dirty Betty's
is in for a treat

16:10.037 --> 16:12.739
when old Motor Hips
moves his magic feet.

16:30.523 --> 16:34.727
I'm so glad you decided
to act in the play after all,
Mrs. Jefferson.

16:34.794 --> 16:37.197
Do you really think
I can do it?

16:37.264 --> 16:40.667
Under my direction,
you can do anything.

16:40.733 --> 16:43.103
Now let's go over
that scene again.

16:49.709 --> 16:52.645
LOUISE: Gary, we can't
go on like this.

16:52.712 --> 16:55.882
I've got to tell my husband.

16:55.948 --> 17:00.087
Darling, my private plane is
waiting at the airport.

17:00.153 --> 17:02.021
We'll send him
a telegram from Rio.

17:06.459 --> 17:07.960
A telegram?

17:08.027 --> 17:11.564
But that's such a cold way
to end a marriage.

17:11.631 --> 17:13.966
Okay, we'll send him
a candygram.

17:16.569 --> 17:18.505
Gary, this is serious.

17:20.407 --> 17:22.475
All right,
so what's going on here?

17:22.542 --> 17:25.578
George, I didn't expect you
home so early.

17:25.645 --> 17:27.013
I can see that.

17:27.080 --> 17:28.681
What the hell is
going on around here?

17:28.748 --> 17:31.151
George, this is
Clifford Wentworth,

17:31.218 --> 17:33.586
the director of the play
at the Help Center.

17:33.653 --> 17:36.756
What is this?
You're not in the cast.

17:36.823 --> 17:41.060
Oh, yeah? If you don't keep
your hands off my wife,
you're gonna be in a cast.

17:42.495 --> 17:44.964
-This is my husband, George.
-Hmm.

17:46.366 --> 17:49.636
You know, I could get you
a part in The Wiz...

17:51.037 --> 17:52.572
As a munchkin.

17:54.641 --> 17:55.842
Oh yeah?
And what do you play?

17:55.908 --> 17:57.910
The wicked witch of the west?

17:57.977 --> 18:02.115
George, Mister Wentworth
is one of the finest directors
in New York.

18:02.182 --> 18:06.085
Ha! I bet you he can't direct
traffic on a one way street.

18:06.153 --> 18:10.490
Louise, I refuse to create
under these conditions.

18:10.557 --> 18:14.361
Oh, Mister Wentworth, please,
I can assure you
he won't bother us again.

18:14.427 --> 18:15.895
Weezy, where is my lunch?

18:15.962 --> 18:18.398
You'll have to get it
yourself! I'm busy now!

18:18.465 --> 18:21.334
-But I've gotta...
-George, I said I'm busy!

18:25.872 --> 18:27.974
There'll be no more
interruptions.

18:28.040 --> 18:29.642
Well, let's hope not.

18:29.709 --> 18:33.480
Now, shall we take it from
the top of the second act?

18:33.546 --> 18:36.115
Louise,
this is the critical scene.

18:36.183 --> 18:38.318
I want you to do
exactly as I say.

18:38.385 --> 18:42.622
You'll play it without words,
using your body as
a dramatic instrument.

18:42.689 --> 18:44.291
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

18:44.357 --> 18:46.559
Okay, all right.

18:46.626 --> 18:49.061
Now you're alone
in your hotel room.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.198
It's late.
You haven't heard
from your lover.

18:51.264 --> 18:52.699
You're angry.

18:54.534 --> 18:55.568
Angrier.

18:58.171 --> 19:00.873
You think you hear
a knock at the door.

19:00.940 --> 19:02.275
Could it be him?

19:02.342 --> 19:03.776
You're frightened.

19:03.843 --> 19:06.145
You run to the door, quickly!

19:07.647 --> 19:09.649
But it was only the wind.

19:12.385 --> 19:15.655
You close the door.
You're depressed.

19:17.890 --> 19:20.427
What's the matter, Louise,
did you slam your finger?

19:22.295 --> 19:23.630
No. Why?

19:23.696 --> 19:26.899
Well, that look of pain
on your face.

19:26.966 --> 19:29.702
Oh, that was
my depressed look.

19:29.769 --> 19:31.103
Oh. I see.

19:32.138 --> 19:33.806
Well, let's proceed.

19:33.873 --> 19:34.874
You need a drink.

19:36.476 --> 19:38.411
But no,
that's the easy way out.

19:38.478 --> 19:40.980
Instead,
you decide to call him.

19:42.882 --> 19:45.151
No, you won't give him
the satisfaction.

19:45.218 --> 19:47.820
You really need that drink.

19:47.887 --> 19:51.324
No, you must call him
and tell him
how you really feel.

19:52.559 --> 19:54.060
But the line's dead.

19:54.126 --> 19:56.696
A look of horror
comes over your face.

19:59.999 --> 20:02.602
The secret police
have cut the line.

20:02.669 --> 20:05.004
That's it.
They know where you are.

20:05.071 --> 20:06.439
You're terrified.

20:06.506 --> 20:08.841
Suddenly, you hear
a horrible scream!

20:08.908 --> 20:10.142
Baloney!

20:14.046 --> 20:15.348
George!

20:15.415 --> 20:17.784
I can't even find
a piece of baloney in here.

20:17.850 --> 20:20.086
I believe his trough is empty.

20:22.789 --> 20:25.992
George, if you
want some baloney,
go look in a mirror.

20:28.461 --> 20:29.996
Please let's go on.

20:30.062 --> 20:33.600
Okay, Louise.
But this time,
play it bigger.

20:33.666 --> 20:36.035
-Bigger?
-Bigger.

20:36.102 --> 20:38.271
What did you call me, honky?

20:46.279 --> 20:48.581
George, do you have
to stay in here?

20:48.648 --> 20:51.284
Yeah, this is my apartment.
I can stay wherever I want.

20:51.351 --> 20:55.154
If I found you
in my apartment,
I'd spray you with Raid.

20:56.956 --> 20:58.391
Say what?

20:58.458 --> 21:01.961
Louise, we've got three weeks
to get this play ready.

21:02.028 --> 21:05.732
You'll have to solve
your personal problems
on your own time.

21:05.798 --> 21:08.200
I'm going back
to the Help Center.

21:10.269 --> 21:11.604
-Peasant!
-Turkey!

21:16.108 --> 21:17.777
Thanks a lot, George!

21:17.844 --> 21:20.413
Don't mention it, Weezy.
Sounded like a dumb play
anyway.

21:20.480 --> 21:21.648
It's a good play,

21:21.714 --> 21:24.517
-with a very fine,
talented director!
-Oh.

21:24.584 --> 21:27.520
And I'm gonna be rehearsing
afternoons and evenings.

21:27.587 --> 21:29.589
Hey, wait a minute,
ain't you forgetting
something?

21:29.656 --> 21:30.890
-What?
-Me.

21:30.957 --> 21:32.525
What happens when I
come home for lunch?

21:32.592 --> 21:34.961
I don't know, George.
I won't be here.

21:35.027 --> 21:37.797
-But, Weezy...
-I'm just following your
advice, George.

21:37.864 --> 21:40.032
I'm doing my own thing.

21:48.708 --> 21:53.245
It's over, Sara.
I'm leaving for Switzerland
in the morning alone.

21:53.312 --> 21:54.581
(GASPS)

22:00.019 --> 22:02.955
Bravo, Mrs. J. That's perfect.

22:03.022 --> 22:08.361
Oh, thanks. But I'm still
a little nervous about getting
up in front of an audience.

22:08.428 --> 22:09.996
Oh yes, stage fright.

22:10.062 --> 22:11.798
You know,
I had a great, great uncle

22:11.864 --> 22:13.566
who once had to appear
in a public square

22:13.633 --> 22:15.602
in front of
a large crowd of people.

22:15.668 --> 22:17.003
Was he nervous?

22:17.069 --> 22:19.972
Uh, yes. But after a moment,
his nervousness disappeared.

22:20.039 --> 22:21.307
What happened?

22:21.374 --> 22:22.975
They hanged him.

22:26.946 --> 22:28.014
Hi, Weez.

22:28.080 --> 22:31.317
Oh, George, you're not
in your disco clothes.

22:31.384 --> 22:33.586
-I know.
-But you'll be late.

22:33.653 --> 22:36.188
-I'm not going.
-What?

22:36.255 --> 22:38.057
Well, I gave it
a lot of thought,

22:38.124 --> 22:42.562
and I decided that
I'd rather stay home with my
sweet, loving, wonderful wife.

22:42.629 --> 22:45.197
You are giving up
discoing for me?

22:45.264 --> 22:46.499
That's right.

22:46.566 --> 22:49.235
Oh, George, thanks.

22:49.301 --> 22:52.839
I'll call Mister Wentworth
and tell him I won't be
at rehearsal tonight.

22:52.905 --> 22:54.674
You're giving up the play?

22:54.741 --> 22:56.308
Absolutely.

22:56.375 --> 22:58.445
I'd rather spend
all my evenings

22:58.511 --> 23:01.481
with my wonderful,
considerate husband.

23:01.548 --> 23:03.583
Oh shoot, Weezy,
I ain't that great.

23:03.650 --> 23:06.052
Oh yes, you are.

23:06.118 --> 23:11.057
Now you just sit right here
and make yourself comfortable
while I fix dinner.

23:11.123 --> 23:12.992
-Oh!
-What's the matter?

23:13.059 --> 23:14.293
Nothing.

23:15.595 --> 23:18.831
Take it easy, Weez.
My back hurts.

23:18.898 --> 23:22.368
How did you hurt it?
Too much disco dancing, eh?

23:22.435 --> 23:23.870
Quiet, Bentley.

23:23.936 --> 23:26.739
So that's it!

23:26.806 --> 23:30.810
The only reason
you're staying home with me
is because you can't dance!

23:30.877 --> 23:32.679
Now wait a minute, Weezy.

23:32.745 --> 23:35.548
(MIMICS GEORGE)
I decided to stay home with my
sweet, loving, wonderful wife.

23:38.350 --> 23:39.952
Well, what's that look for?

23:40.019 --> 23:42.221
That's a look of anger.

23:42.288 --> 23:43.490
Where are you going?

23:43.556 --> 23:45.625
To the play!
I'm late for rehearsal.

23:45.692 --> 23:48.227
Uh, Weezy,
but I need you here tonight.
What about my back?

23:48.294 --> 23:52.164
I'm sure Mister Bentley
will be glad
to help you out with it.

23:52.231 --> 23:54.934
Oh, of course.
Please lie down.

23:56.569 --> 23:58.671
But, Weezy,
what about my dinner?

23:58.738 --> 24:00.039
Oh, let's see.

24:00.106 --> 24:03.142
There's three weeks rehearsal.
One week performance.

24:03.209 --> 24:06.412
If you're lucky,
you should get dinner
in about four weeks.

24:06.479 --> 24:07.747
Four weeks?

24:09.616 --> 24:13.152
* Shake, shake, shake,
shake your booty

24:13.219 --> 24:17.389
* Shake your booty
Shake your booty

24:17.456 --> 24:20.459
* Shake, shake, shake,
shake your booty *

24:47.053 --> 24:51.991
LOUISE: The Jeffersons was
videotaped in front of
a studio audience.

24:52.058 --> 24:54.360
* Movin', movin' on up
