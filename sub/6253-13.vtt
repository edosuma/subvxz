10:13.697 --> 10:18.908
So I scanned through
the security footage
from the loony bin and—

10:18.994 --> 10:20.609
[Angela Sighs]

10:20.704 --> 10:23.741
That’s the front door
of the psychiatric facility
where Ethan escaped from.

10:23.832 --> 10:26.949
That’s me. I’m carrying
the book that he gave me.

10:27.044 --> 10:29.330
Yeah, this-this is—
This is time-stamped...

10:29.421 --> 10:31.377
the night before
Ethan Sawyer disappeared.

10:32.257 --> 10:33.793
No, that’s incorrect.

10:33.884 --> 10:36.296
This footage was taken
two weeks before that,

10:36.386 --> 10:38.297
which is when
he gave me the book.

10:38.388 --> 10:40.674
Sweetie, this—
This is time-stamped.

10:43.811 --> 10:48.430
Pelant must’ve hacked into
the institute’s security system.

10:48.524 --> 10:51.561
I don’t know how
he could’ve altered
this footage.

10:51.652 --> 10:54.985
Look, I’m gonna break
this thing down to the pixels
to figure it out.

10:55.072 --> 10:56.653
But—
[Sighs]

10:56.740 --> 10:59.106
In the meantime,
you’re gonna need
an alibi for this night.

10:59.243 --> 11:01.780
I don’t have one.
Yeah, you do.

11:01.870 --> 11:03.531
You were at
the Founding Fathers,

11:03.622 --> 11:05.658
drinking a Bitter Canadian
with me.

11:05.749 --> 11:08.240
We were talking about
Christine’s christening.

11:09.253 --> 11:12.040
- You’re trying to help me.
- Yeah.

11:12.130 --> 11:14.041
I mean,
you wouldn’t kill anybody.

11:14.132 --> 11:17.670
lbeHeve,
under certain circumstances,
I most certainly would kill.

11:17.761 --> 11:23.051
Like someone thinking
your daughter is a demon
and threatening to kill her?

11:28.605 --> 11:30.345
Oh, my God.

11:36.864 --> 11:39.901
This is bad.
This is very bad.
I wasn’t there, Booth.

11:39.992 --> 11:41.857
The security footage says 7:14.

11:41.952 --> 11:44.318
That’s four hours
unaccounted for
before you got home.

11:44.413 --> 11:46.699
That’s plenty of time to
abduct and murder Ethan...

11:46.790 --> 11:48.781
and then make it back
before 11:00.

11:48.876 --> 11:50.912
- Don’t say it like that.
- Like what?

11:51.044 --> 11:53.706
Like it’s not you
that were talkin’ about.
I didn’t do it, Booth.

11:53.797 --> 11:57.039
It doesn’t matter.
It doesn’t matter, Bones.
You’re on that video.

11:57.175 --> 11:59.211
I’ll be fine, Booth.
Christine is asleep.

11:59.303 --> 12:01.339
Angela will be able
to tell that the video
has been altered.

12:01.430 --> 12:02.966
Is everything okay?
Well, she hasn’t so far.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.557
And since Ethan
threatened Christine,

12:04.641 --> 12:06.552
that gives you motive
and opportunity.

12:06.643 --> 12:08.850
Can you ignore evidence like that?
’Cause I sure as hell can’t.

12:08.937 --> 12:10.973
This— This guy Pelant,
he’s framing you.

12:11.064 --> 12:13.350
- It would seem so.
- [ Booth ]
Yes. He is.

12:13.442 --> 12:16.184
All the evidence
is now pointing to her
as the killer.

12:16.278 --> 12:19.395
- Weren’t you getting close
to nailing this guy?
- Yes. And Ethan was helping.

12:19.489 --> 12:22.526
Yeah. Ethan was helping.
Look what happened to him.

12:22.618 --> 12:25.030
- Honey, you need a plan.
- We can handle this, Max.

12:25.120 --> 12:28.658
- Well, you haven’t so far.
- Everyone at the Jeffersonian
is working on this, Dad.

12:28.749 --> 12:31.456
We will find evidence that
links all of this to Pelant.

12:31.543 --> 12:33.408
Right. And if you don’t?

12:33.503 --> 12:36.370
Max, please. Thank you so much
for putting Christine to bed.

12:36.465 --> 12:38.046

13:01.657 --> 13:03.864
Dr. Brennan didn’t see this
when she went over the X—rays?

13:03.951 --> 13:05.407
No. l was surprised too.

13:05.494 --> 13:07.735
It’s pretty obvious
when you compare the films
to the actual bone.

13:07.829 --> 13:10.536
Maybe she thought
it was another bite mark
from the wolves.

13:10.624 --> 13:13.957
Look at the enlarged image.
I think it’s the tip of a needle.

13:14.086 --> 13:17.704

it was another bite mark.

It’s definitely
a hypodermic needle.

13:49.871 --> 13:52.908
- Could there be traces of
the drug inside the tip?
- Maybe.

13:56.169 --> 13:57.545
Okay.

13:57.629 --> 13:59.369

14:13.353 --> 14:15.935
I wouldn’t blame you.
It’s a reasonable assumption.

14:17.441 --> 14:19.523
Can you stop
being like that? Okay?

14:19.609 --> 14:21.770
It’s not reasonable.
Not for me.

14:25.073 --> 14:27.450
Do you want me to come
to Christine’s christening?

14:28.618 --> 14:30.609
You don’t have
to worry about that now.

14:32.622 --> 14:35.329
I don’t want Pelant
to change our lives.

14:35.417 --> 14:37.408
That would be the worst.

you missed it?

16:47.048 --> 16:48.959
I don’t know.

16:49.050 --> 16:53.419
Perhaps because
the victim was someone

No.

[ Hodgins ] There was a trace

It’s a neuromuscular

asked me if she could have one.
What?

She said she was
studying some-some tribe

Oh, one last thing.
A little advice.

22:18.838 --> 22:22.422
With a guy like Pelant,
nothing is the way it seems.

22:22.509 --> 22:24.921
Great.
l’ll remember that.

22:32.977 --> 22:37.562
So, this is the last thing
that Brennan looked at before
she was removed from the case.

22:37.690 --> 22:39.942
All the victim’s
wounds?
Yes.

22:40.026 --> 22:42.733
Can you remove
the damage done
by the wolves?

22:42.820 --> 22:44.151
[Angela ]
Sure.

22:46.574 --> 22:48.690
- That’s weird.
- There’s a pattern.

22:48.785 --> 22:50.241
Does it mean anything?

22:50.328 --> 22:51.989
[Angela ]
Well, if Pelant did this,

22:52.080 --> 22:53.695
then it could be
one of his weird codes.

22:53.831 --> 22:56.288
Like introducing
a virus into the program?
You think so?

22:56.376 --> 22:57.957
It’s what he does.
Turn it off.

22:58.044 --> 23:01.582
Wait. No. I know this pattern.
This has nothing to do
with computer viruses.

23:01.673 --> 23:03.789
Superimpose
the arterial system.

23:05.510 --> 23:06.920
Remove the veins.

23:07.011 --> 23:10.629
Can you enlarge the areas
where the nicks were found?

23:11.724 --> 23:14.636
Whoa. All those marks
cross minor arteries.

23:14.727 --> 23:17.514
Pelant cut them.
The wolves were drawn
by the scent of blood.

23:17.605 --> 23:19.516
This proves murder,
right?

23:19.607 --> 23:21.563
I mean, this guy
didn’t just wander
into the woods...

23:21.651 --> 23:23.516
and drink some poison
and wait to be
eaten by wolves.

23:23.611 --> 23:25.772
They certainly
weren’t self—inflicted.

23:26.864 --> 23:29.776
Dr. Saroyan?
What are you gonna do?

23:29.867 --> 23:32.449
I am gonna report this
to Special Agent Flynn.

23:32.537 --> 23:34.368
They’re gonna think
that Brennan did this.

23:34.455 --> 23:36.366
Because Pelant has
no background or training...

23:36.457 --> 23:38.493
in anatomy
or the circulatory system.

23:38.626 --> 23:40.162
I know.
Do you have to?

23:41.129 --> 23:42.710
Yes. It is my job.

23:42.797 --> 23:44.662
So, what?
So Pelant wins?

23:44.757 --> 23:46.258
Yes.

23:46.342 --> 23:49.004
Today, Pelant wins.

23:53.933 --> 23:56.845
I thought Cam told you
not to contact me.

23:56.936 --> 24:00.428
I don’t care much
about what Cam says
these days, okay?

24:00.523 --> 24:03.105
Listen, I’m looking into
the e-mail exchange
between you and Ethan...

24:03.192 --> 24:04.693
to see how Pelant
accessed them.

24:04.777 --> 24:06.938
- How? You said
they were all encrypted.
- Yeah, I don’t know.

24:07.030 --> 24:10.943
That’s why I’m looking
into every computer trail
that leads back to Pelant.

24:11.075 --> 24:13.282
Thanks, Angela.
Yeah.

24:13.369 --> 24:14.905
I’m just being selfish.

24:14.996 --> 24:17.908
If you go to jail,
I don’t have anybody
to go to baby group with.

24:17.999 --> 24:21.366
Now, I need all the passwords
that you’ve used
within the past year.

24:25.298 --> 24:29.712
Your profile says
the killer is hyperrational,
deliberate and exacting.

24:29.802 --> 24:31.463
That’s correct.
When I read Pelant’s
transcripts—

24:31.554 --> 24:32.919
Would you describe
Dr. Brennan...

24:33.014 --> 24:35.130
as hyperrational,
deliberate and exacting?

24:35.224 --> 24:37.010
My profile fits Pelant.

24:37.101 --> 24:39.137
Yeah, I understand
that’s what you’d like.

24:39.228 --> 24:40.764
But please
answer the question.

24:40.855 --> 24:42.720
You have to answer, cher.

24:45.568 --> 24:48.810
That description could be
applied to Dr. Brennan.

24:48.946 --> 24:50.902
Thank you.
In certain situations.

24:50.990 --> 24:53.982
You also posit that the killer
had a compromised childhood
because of abandonment.

24:54.077 --> 24:56.568
Yes. Pelant’s parents
divorced when he was young.

24:56.663 --> 24:58.995
He was close with his father,
which he rarely saw after—

24:59.082 --> 25:01.289
Wasn’t Dr. Brennan actually
abandoned by her father?

25:01.376 --> 25:03.207
It’s not that simple.
He returned.

25:03.294 --> 25:05.000
Eighteen years later.

25:05.088 --> 25:07.795
The other psychologist
who reviewed your report said
that would actually be worse.

25:07.882 --> 25:12.000
Look, I know Dr. Brennan.
She’s a good person.

25:12.095 --> 25:15.178
She’s compassionate
and empathetic
and a wonderful mother.

25:15.264 --> 25:17.346
And how far
would that wonderful,
hyperrational mother go...

25:17.433 --> 25:19.014
to protect her child,
Dr. Sweets?

25:19.102 --> 25:20.888
No, I know her.
She didn’t kill him.

25:23.189 --> 25:26.522
The Bureau will be using
an outside consultant for all
future profiling on this case.

25:26.651 --> 25:29.643
I’m sure you understand.
So I’m off the case.

25:38.037 --> 25:39.948
Come on.
You gotta be kidding me.

25:40.039 --> 25:42.371
Can’t Caroline appeal this?

25:42.458 --> 25:44.164
I mean, come on,
S-Sweets.

25:44.252 --> 25:47.710
I mean, you, of all people,
know more about this case
than anyone.

25:47.797 --> 25:49.503
Okay. Great.
[Beeps]

25:49.590 --> 25:53.082
Sweets got kicked off the case.
Agent Flynn accused him
of being too close to you.

25:53.177 --> 25:55.919
That seems like
a reasonable decision
from their perspective.

25:56.013 --> 25:58.140
Can we just stop being
so reasonable, please?
[Angela] Hey, hey!

25:58.224 --> 25:59.725
I think
I got something here.

25:59.809 --> 26:02.391
Look at this.
What is it?

26:02.478 --> 26:05.936
| hacked into his credit card bill,
his phone bill and his library card.

26:06.023 --> 26:08.685
- You’re hacking the hacker?
- Yeah. There’s something kind
of poetic about it, right?

26:08.776 --> 26:12.234
So, according to
his library records,
Pelant reads a lot.

26:12.321 --> 26:13.572
That makes sense.

26:13.656 --> 26:15.897
He was confined,
and the library
delivers to shut-ins.

26:15.992 --> 26:17.778
No, I mean,
he reads a lot a lot.

26:17.869 --> 26:21.361
They delivered
and picked up over 80 books
within the past three months.

26:21.456 --> 26:22.696
Wow. No one reads
that much.

26:22.832 --> 26:24.697
I do.
No one is you, Bones.

26:24.792 --> 26:26.498
Do me a favor.
Pull up his cable bill.

26:26.586 --> 26:28.827
I wanna see how many
pay-per—view movies
he’s ordered.

26:28.921 --> 26:31.583
[Angela Scoffs ]
Wow. A lot.

26:31.674 --> 26:34.757
Even you couldn’t watch
all these movies and read
all those books, sweetie.

26:34.844 --> 26:37.381
We have to get the books
that were delivered.

26:37.472 --> 26:39.178
[ Doorbell Rings]

26:40.683 --> 26:43.345
[Whispering ]
Pack that up.
Just get over there.

26:50.485 --> 26:51.895
Sorry
for the interruption.

26:51.986 --> 26:54.102
I have a warrant to
search Dr. Brennan’s
home and vehicle.

26:54.197 --> 26:57.189
[ Chuckles ]
Of course you do, right?
Oh, not so fast.

26:57.283 --> 27:01.196
This says, uh, 914. We’re 941.
This warrant’s not for us.

27:01.287 --> 27:02.743
It’s a technicality.

27:02.830 --> 27:04.536
Of course. They operate
on technicalities.

27:04.624 --> 27:06.785
Come on, Flynn.
You know that.

27:06.876 --> 27:10.334
I mean, you find something—
which you won’t—
it won’t be admissible.

27:10.421 --> 27:13.003
I can be back in two hours
with another warrant
for the house.

27:13.090 --> 27:14.591
But her Prius
is parked on the street,

27:14.675 --> 27:16.961
and the license plate
matches the one
on the warrant.

27:17.094 --> 27:19.380
Give me the keys.
Um—

27:20.640 --> 27:22.596
We lost them.
[ Chuckles ]
We’ll tow it.

27:23.684 --> 27:26.266
Fine. Knock yourself out.
And I mean that.

27:28.189 --> 27:30.680
Thanks for stoppin’ by, Flynn.

27:32.652 --> 27:36.270
Pack up all the stuff
that we have on Pelant.
Angela, get to the library.

27:36.405 --> 27:38.316
Yeah. Okay.
Get to the library.

27:38.407 --> 27:40.318
Check out all the books
that he checked out.

27:40.409 --> 27:42.900
There’s gotta be a reason
why he picked out those books.

27:52.463 --> 27:55.205
Hey.
So, I found these—

27:56.884 --> 27:58.875
What is wrong?
Are you okay?

28:00.221 --> 28:01.586
Well—
[Clears Throat]

28:01.681 --> 28:03.888
the FBI.
sent over hair samples...

28:03.975 --> 28:07.308
from Dr. Brennan’s trunk.

28:07.395 --> 28:09.727
[ Exhales ]
God.

28:09.814 --> 28:12.351
I looked at it
a hundred times.

28:13.609 --> 28:15.816
I want a different result,
but it—

28:15.903 --> 28:17.439
[ Sniffles ]

28:17.530 --> 28:20.488
it’s a match
for the victim.

28:20.575 --> 28:22.782
The hair belongs
to Ethan Sawyer.

28:22.869 --> 28:25.656
Cam, wha—

28:26.956 --> 28:28.617
What are you gonna do?

28:28.708 --> 28:31.290
Well, I am gonna
get myself together,

28:31.377 --> 28:33.584
and I’m gonna
do the right thing.

28:33.671 --> 28:35.081
Which is?

28:36.799 --> 28:38.630
I’m sorry.

28:38.718 --> 28:40.458
[ Sniffles ]

28:40.553 --> 28:44.421
I’m sorry, but either
you believe in the system
or you don’t.

28:45.683 --> 28:47.173
And I do.

28:47.268 --> 28:49.179
I’m not supposed
to be here.

28:49.270 --> 28:51.352
[ Sighs ]
This doesn’t sound good.

28:51.439 --> 28:52.849
It’s not good, cher.

28:52.982 --> 28:56.315
There’s too much
evidence piling up.
Well, you know she didn’t do it.

28:56.402 --> 28:58.734
OthenNise you wouldn’t
have put that wrong address
on the search warrant.

28:58.821 --> 29:01.938
- I don’t know what
you’re talking about, cher.
- She doesn’t have a choice.

29:02.074 --> 29:04.451
It doesn’t matter
what she believes.
I’m sorry.

29:04.535 --> 29:09.279
I’m sure this will work out,
but, for now, l have got
to get an arrest warrant.

29:10.917 --> 29:12.703
This is a nightmare.

29:12.793 --> 29:15.921
It’ll take me a few hours,
if! drag my heels. Right?

29:16.005 --> 29:18.917
So you’ll have time to
get your affairs in order
and say good-bye.

29:19.008 --> 29:20.748
- Thank you.
- [Christine Crying]

29:20.843 --> 29:23.550
- You’re thanking her?
- The baby’s crying.

29:25.932 --> 29:27.797
[Crying Continues]

29:29.685 --> 29:33.553
You don’t think I wouldn’t
give anything to have this
turn out differently?

29:34.941 --> 29:36.272
I’ll call when I
get the warrant...

29:36.359 --> 29:38.896
so Dr. Brennan
can turn herself in.

29:38.986 --> 29:40.977
It’ll go better that way.

29:41.739 --> 29:44.526
Cher, I’m sorry.

29:56.963 --> 29:58.794
Hey. Anything?
Hey.

29:58.881 --> 30:03.420
Uh, look, I know you’re—
you’re trying to be helpful
and concerned, but—

30:03.511 --> 30:06.093
No, I’m not trying
to be helpful
and concerned.

30:06.180 --> 30:09.718
I just wanna know how Pelant
communicates with Skynet
before he comes after me.

30:10.893 --> 30:13.009
It’s got something to do
with these books.

30:13.104 --> 30:14.685
Well—

30:14.772 --> 30:16.888
Angie, some of these
aren’t even in English.

30:16.983 --> 30:20.100
I know. I-I’m—
I’m trying to search
for some kind of pattern.

30:20.194 --> 30:23.686
Titles, publication dates,
subjects, binding methods.

30:23.781 --> 30:26.238
Nobody’s gonna
believe Brennan but us.

30:26.325 --> 30:28.407
When we stop looking,
it’s over.

30:28.494 --> 30:29.859
I know.

30:31.372 --> 30:33.158
Hey, what if you arrange
the titles...

30:33.249 --> 30:35.490
in the order in which
he checked them out?

30:35.584 --> 30:38.326
Then you can—
You-You did that already?

30:38.421 --> 30:39.752
Of course.

30:39.880 --> 30:41.871
I love you.
I love you.

30:59.775 --> 31:01.606
Hey, you two.

31:01.694 --> 31:03.025
Dad.

31:03.112 --> 31:05.979
We’re both home today.
You don’t have to watch Christine.

31:06.073 --> 31:08.155
I’m not here
about Christine.

31:14.999 --> 31:18.287
How much time
does Tempe have?
What, before they arrest her?

31:18.377 --> 31:20.868
No, before her first gray hair.
We gotta figure out
what our moves are.

31:20.963 --> 31:22.874
Caroline says that
I should turn myself in...

31:22.965 --> 31:24.751
before the arrest warrant
can be executed.

31:24.842 --> 31:26.924
You gotta make
a run for it, honey. Now.

31:27.011 --> 31:29.718
- Slow down, Max.
- You’ve been thinking
about this for days.

31:29.805 --> 31:31.466
What? Me being a fugitive?

31:31.557 --> 31:33.468
Look, I have been
thinking about it. All right?

31:33.559 --> 31:35.675
The only problem is,
that’s gonna make us
look more guilty.

31:35.770 --> 31:38.352
- You want to work
inside the system.
- I am the system, Max.

31:38.439 --> 31:40.100
No, computers
are the system.

31:40.191 --> 31:42.182
And this son of a bitch
runs computers.

31:42.276 --> 31:46.315
And the minute
they have Tempe in custody,
she is part of the system.

31:46.405 --> 31:48.566
Your only chance
is to get off the grid.

31:48.657 --> 31:51.319
Honey— Honey,
think about it
logically. Okay?

31:51.410 --> 31:53.901
The minute he has you,
he will never let you go.

31:53.996 --> 31:56.328
Look what he did
to that crazy,
smart friend of yours.

31:56.415 --> 31:58.451
We will be fine, Max.
No, you won’t.

31:58.542 --> 32:02.285
You two don’t understand
what happens when the system
turns on you.

32:02.379 --> 32:04.370
I do.

32:17.728 --> 32:19.969
Great. You okay?

32:21.315 --> 32:23.897
We should have
Christine christened
before I’m arrested.

32:23.984 --> 32:26.111
We? You-You mean
both of us?

32:26.237 --> 32:28.148
You’re gonna come?
Yes.

32:30.449 --> 32:32.189
What?
What’s goin’ on?

32:32.284 --> 32:36.573
Ethan was tracking
Pelant’s thought process
mathematically.

32:36.664 --> 32:39.076
Ethan was trying to send me
a mathematical message.

32:39.166 --> 32:42.329
See? He inscribed it
with a quotation
from Alexander Pope.

32:42.419 --> 32:45.001
“Nature and nature’s laws
lay hid in night;

32:45.089 --> 32:48.081
God said, ‘Let Newton be!’
and all was light.”

32:48.175 --> 32:50.416
So, what,
that’s the message?

32:50.553 --> 32:53.420
Definitely.
Okay, what?
About math and light?

32:53.514 --> 32:56.756
Can we get into Ethan’s room
at the psychiatric institute?

32:56.851 --> 32:58.341
No, we can’t.

32:58.435 --> 33:00.687
[Sighs]
Oh, but Hodgins can.

33:05.943 --> 33:07.729
[ Sighs ]
What are we looking for?

33:07.820 --> 33:10.562
Brennan said
it would have to be a message
written within a triangle.

33:10.656 --> 33:12.317
Something about Newton.

33:12.408 --> 33:16.742
First thing we do
is we find three things
that form a triangle.

33:16.829 --> 33:18.911
Three things
always form a triangle.

33:18.998 --> 33:21.410
You, me, the desk—
that’s a triangle.

33:21.500 --> 33:24.537
