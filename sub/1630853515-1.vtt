Hello, Mrs. Harberg.
Welcome to Paris.

01:46.564 --> 01:48.149
-Hi.
-Would you please follow me?

02:07.794 --> 02:11.422
(speaking French)

02:11.506 --> 02:13.216
Mira, this is yours.

02:13.299 --> 02:15.510
-Sorry we kept you waiting.
-No worries.

02:16.553 --> 02:18.680
(lively guitar continues)

02:39.826 --> 02:43.788
Oh, wow, thank God
this is our last stop.

02:43.872 --> 02:47.125
I am so sick
of discussing "Doomsday,"

02:47.208 --> 02:49.794
and why Nausicaa sliced her
superhero husband's throat

02:49.878 --> 02:51.254
and cut off his testicles.

02:51.337 --> 02:52.881
It's the strongest
scene in the film.

02:52.964 --> 02:54.924
-Creepy as fuck, though.
-Yeah, but point is,

02:55.008 --> 02:56.843
it feels good when he dies.

02:56.926 --> 02:59.137
I mean, it's shocking.
No one expects it.

02:59.220 --> 03:03.224
And he's the lead.
How often does a lead die
halfway through the movie?

03:03.308 --> 03:06.519
-Driver:
Are you okay with the AC?
-Yeah, it's fine. Thanks.

03:06.603 --> 03:09.355
I mean, honestly,
that's why the film's
a hit in the U.S.

03:09.439 --> 03:11.900
-And it will be in France, too.
-Yeah. Good for Herman.

03:11.983 --> 03:15.069
And good for you.
You needed a hit.

03:15.153 --> 03:17.822
Regina, I don't need a hit.
I need a good movie.

03:17.906 --> 03:20.033
Yeah, but blockbusters let
you make the movies you love.

03:20.116 --> 03:22.911
And spend the next
two months in Paris

03:22.994 --> 03:26.039
-shooting "The Vampires."
-Yeah, with René Vidal.

03:26.122 --> 03:27.582
I worshipped him in film school.

03:27.665 --> 03:29.751
You should tell him.
He'll be thrilled.

03:29.834 --> 03:32.420
-I wouldn't dare.
-Then I'll tell him for you.

03:32.503 --> 03:35.465
I can't believe I finally get
to meet René in person tomorrow.

03:35.548 --> 03:37.717
I'm so sick of Zoom.

03:39.177 --> 03:40.011
Hey.

03:40.094 --> 03:41.930
-(speaking French)
-Hello, hello.

03:42.013 --> 03:43.806
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.141
-Ah, this is Mira.
-Hi.

03:45.224 --> 03:47.769
-Welcome to the Plaza Athénée.
-Mira: Thank you.

03:47.852 --> 03:49.145
May I show you to your suite?

03:49.228 --> 03:50.480
-Mira: Ah, y--
-Oh, is it possible to look

03:50.563 --> 03:52.690
at the schedule
before you rest?

03:53.858 --> 03:55.777
Uh, yeah, sure.

03:55.860 --> 03:58.488
Shall we go to the lounge?

03:58.571 --> 04:00.365
-Yeah.
-Bellman: This is your key.

04:00.448 --> 04:02.575
-Thank you very much.
-Bellman: Pleasure.

04:02.659 --> 04:04.577
Have a nice day.
See you later.

04:04.661 --> 04:06.371
So...

04:06.454 --> 04:08.665
we start with
the "Vogue" photoshoot.

04:08.748 --> 04:12.835
Remember? They want you
in your "Doomsday" spacesuit.

04:12.919 --> 04:15.797
I asked you.
You said it was fine.

04:15.880 --> 04:19.008
-Did I?
-You did, but, I mean,
we can still tell them

04:19.092 --> 04:21.344
-you're not comfortable with it.
-No. It's fine, it's fine.

04:21.427 --> 04:23.972
Then, as agreed,
we do TV.

04:24.764 --> 04:28.226
Simple network spots.

04:29.811 --> 04:31.646
Here's the list.

04:33.648 --> 04:34.732
Thank you.

04:38.903 --> 04:41.072
Wait, what's the second one?
Did we agree on that?

04:41.155 --> 04:43.241
Yes, we discussed it.
It's a real big deal.

04:43.324 --> 04:45.910
Two and a half
to 3 million viewers
a night.

04:45.994 --> 04:47.286
We give them 15 minutes.

04:47.370 --> 04:48.621
Then, uh, we come
back to the hotel,

04:48.705 --> 04:50.748
and you have one hour
to prepare for the premiere.

04:50.832 --> 04:52.500
You'll introduce
the film on stage.

04:52.583 --> 04:54.544
Herman will be
there as well.

04:54.627 --> 04:57.338
-Ooh, Herman.
-Michelle: Yes.

04:57.422 --> 04:59.632
The director's in town
with his new wife.

05:01.426 --> 05:03.594
Laurie?

05:03.678 --> 05:07.765
So, uh... no one was gonna
tell me Laurie is here?

05:07.849 --> 05:09.767
It's our last
European premiere date,

05:09.851 --> 05:12.770
and Herman thought that you'd
like to celebrate together.

05:12.854 --> 05:13.980
-Oh.
-I only heard

05:14.063 --> 05:16.649
Laurie was comin'
an hour ago. I'm sorry.

05:16.733 --> 05:18.067
Michelle:
He brought Laurie
because they wanted

05:18.151 --> 05:22.530
a romantic weekend in Paris
before going back to LA.

05:22.613 --> 05:24.073
Regina, did you know about this?

05:24.157 --> 05:26.200
No, absolutely not.

05:27.243 --> 05:28.286
I swear.

05:28.369 --> 05:30.163
Laurie used to be
Mira's assistant

05:30.246 --> 05:32.081
for three years.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.958
I had no idea.

05:34.042 --> 05:35.376
-Yeah.
-She and Herman met on set,

05:35.460 --> 05:38.004
-and they married
a week after wrap.
-Excuse me?

05:38.087 --> 05:39.922
Is there something you
want me to do about it?

05:40.006 --> 05:42.925
-No... Yeah, it's fine.
-No, okay.

05:43.009 --> 05:45.344
Regina:
At least Herman
made it this time.

05:45.428 --> 05:48.097
Well, he skipped most
of the premiere dates.

05:48.181 --> 05:52.935
He promised to come
to Stockholm and Rome...
but he bailed.

05:53.019 --> 05:56.105
Well, he's working
on a new project.
Marvel.

05:56.189 --> 05:58.107
-Oh, of course.
-A sequel.

05:58.191 --> 05:59.734
A sequel to what?

05:59.817 --> 06:01.319
I don't know.
I lost track.

06:01.402 --> 06:03.362
Sequel to a whole
bunch of them.

06:03.446 --> 06:05.740
-Saw it in the trades.
-Okay, the set is ready.

06:05.823 --> 06:06.741
You can come with me.

06:06.824 --> 06:09.952

06:12.663 --> 06:14.832
-Photographer: Hello.
-Hi.

06:14.916 --> 06:19.128
So, production sent me a few,
and I brought a few, so, okay.

06:19.212 --> 06:21.631
-Mira: Double guns?
-Photographer: Yeah, whatever
you feel comfortable with.

06:21.714 --> 06:24.050

Open a little bit more the feet.

06:34.560 --> 06:37.146
And, yeah, good.

06:37.230 --> 06:40.358
-(laughter)
-No, uh, when we were
shooting "Doomsday," uh,

06:40.441 --> 06:43.694
none of us imagined
it would be so big.

06:43.778 --> 06:45.738
Maybe Herman had
another perspective.

06:45.822 --> 06:47.448
-(laughter)
-No, I-I-- We were just,

06:47.532 --> 06:49.867
you know, trying to make it
as good as we could,

06:49.951 --> 06:52.829
as believable as possible,

06:52.912 --> 06:55.998
which is a challenge when
it's about superheroes.

06:56.082 --> 06:57.500
Don't you think
it struck a nerve

06:57.583 --> 07:00.002
because of present-day
politics in Europe?

07:00.086 --> 07:01.462
What kind of politics?

07:01.546 --> 07:03.089
The rise of populism.

07:03.172 --> 07:04.882
-Gender equality.
-Gender equality?

07:04.966 --> 07:09.178
Um... feels ever-present to me.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.681
Cutting off
Ragnar's testicles

07:11.764 --> 07:13.641
was a pretty radical act.

07:13.724 --> 07:16.811
-It was in the screenplay.
-(laughter)

07:16.894 --> 07:19.438
-But you sold it.
-Yeah, but I try my best

07:19.522 --> 07:22.525
to be as, as honest as possible,

07:22.608 --> 07:24.902
and try to channel
the woman I play.

07:24.986 --> 07:27.572
But yeah, this...
was a tough one.

07:27.655 --> 07:30.575
-Especially for Ragnar.
-(laughter)

07:30.658 --> 07:31.742
In an interview you said

07:31.826 --> 07:34.162
you were concerned
with the future of Europe,

07:34.245 --> 07:36.873
and the unraveling
of democracy in Hungary.

07:36.956 --> 07:40.710

Um, but European politics?

07:42.670 --> 07:47.175
I, I, I can't say I--
I don't know much about that.

07:47.258 --> 07:48.718
Maybe Herman
said something.

07:48.801 --> 07:50.678
Yeah, but, uh,
you approved.

07:50.761 --> 07:52.555
Maybe I nodded, uh.

07:52.638 --> 07:56.601
I-I-- No, but honestly,
I don't have a clue.

07:56.684 --> 07:59.187
The only thing
I can say is that, um,

07:59.270 --> 08:02.023
Herman's set
is not exactly a democracy.

08:02.106 --> 08:04.650
-(laughter)
-What do you mean by that?

08:04.734 --> 08:08.613
I was joking.
Don't make me say

12:13.441 --> 12:15.734
Great, um, listen,
you know what?

12:15.818 --> 12:18.946
I have a hunch that we'll
probably pick up a few noms,

12:19.029 --> 12:21.615
so be around.

12:21.699 --> 12:25.202
Great! Well, um,
fingers crossed.

12:25.286 --> 12:26.620
Fingers crossed!

12:32.084 --> 12:34.503
-Mira: Laurie.
-Hi.

12:37.590 --> 12:40.301
-We need to catch up.
-We do.

12:40.384 --> 12:42.428
I haven't heard much
from you since the shoot.

12:42.511 --> 12:45.473
Well, you were
invited to the wedding,
but you didn't RSVP.

12:45.556 --> 12:46.849
I texted.

12:48.058 --> 12:50.394
-Want a smoke?
-Sure.

13:00.070 --> 13:01.238
Mm...

13:03.240 --> 13:05.367
Let's be clear.
(chuckles)

13:05.451 --> 13:09.497
I had... no idea
about you and Herman.

13:09.580 --> 13:12.625
-Oh, I thought it was obvious.
-Not at all.

13:12.708 --> 13:15.878
Fine, I guess
I was just waiting
for the right moment.

13:15.961 --> 13:20.049
-But it never came.
-No... No, not really, no.

13:20.132 --> 13:23.636
I must've been, like,
the last person to find out.

13:23.719 --> 13:27.264
-I didn't want to hurt you.
-Be honest.

13:27.348 --> 13:28.557
You were scared.

13:28.641 --> 13:31.435
Yes, I was scared.
You ever wonder
why I was scared?

13:31.519 --> 13:34.939
-Yeah, because you
felt like a cheater.
-No, because you're scary.

13:35.022 --> 13:36.524
And you scared me.

13:36.607 --> 13:38.859
-You think you're easy, huh?
-No.

13:38.943 --> 13:42.029
-And I never pretended to be.
-Especially when you're drunk.

13:42.112 --> 13:44.698
-Now I'm sober.
-Good for you.

13:47.576 --> 13:50.162
You weren't exactly
faithful either.

13:50.246 --> 13:53.415
Who said I was monogamous?

13:53.499 --> 13:55.709
And you never thought
that might hurt me?

14:01.173 --> 14:02.341
No...

14:03.926 --> 14:05.970
Honestly, no, I didn't.

14:08.806 --> 14:10.140
I have a question.

14:11.058 --> 14:12.351
Doesn't an open relationship

14:12.434 --> 14:13.852
go both ways?

14:13.936 --> 14:16.438
No... it doesn't.

14:16.522 --> 14:19.233
God, you're fucking controlling.

14:22.069 --> 14:24.863
I'm just not used
to getting dumped.

14:24.947 --> 14:28.242
-I think you're overstating
that a little bit.
-And for Herman?

14:28.325 --> 14:33.163
I mean... come on, he's,
he's, he's such a bore.

14:33.247 --> 14:36.083
-He's a good person.
-He's a good person?

14:36.166 --> 14:39.962
-He's nice.
-He's a dime-a-dozen
douche from LA.

14:40.045 --> 14:41.922
Ugh!

14:42.006 --> 14:44.383
What do you wanna hear?
That you're a better fuck
than Herman?

14:44.466 --> 14:47.344
You know I'm a better
fuck than Herman!

14:50.431 --> 14:51.557
So...

14:53.058 --> 14:55.394
what's the plan, huh?

14:56.854 --> 15:00.858
Two kids... and a little
white picket fence?

15:02.610 --> 15:04.069
He already has a family.

15:04.153 --> 15:05.237
(groans)

15:06.196 --> 15:07.281
Not anymore.

15:07.364 --> 15:10.409
-Who are you to judge me?
-I'm not judging you.

15:10.492 --> 15:12.244
If you want a more...

15:13.787 --> 15:16.540
-boring life?
-You mean a more
boring hetero life?

15:16.624 --> 15:18.417
A boring hetero life.

15:18.500 --> 15:21.170
Like when you got off
on being this glamorous

15:21.253 --> 15:22.755
Hollywood couple with Eamonn?

15:22.838 --> 15:24.840
-Yeah, sure.
-Wait, wait, wait, wait.

15:24.923 --> 15:27.551
If I remember correctly,

15:27.635 --> 15:31.180
I... I wasn't only

15:31.263 --> 15:32.848
dating Eamonn.

15:32.931 --> 15:35.184
No...
You were fucking me too

15:35.267 --> 15:37.853
in between errands
I was running for you.

15:40.397 --> 15:43.859
I can see you have
a better life...
with Herman.

15:45.486 --> 15:46.570
I do.

15:47.905 --> 15:52.951
You, um...
use his credit card.

15:53.035 --> 15:55.871
-I do.
-You have a villa in the Canyon,

15:55.954 --> 15:57.498
and a convertible.

15:57.581 --> 16:00.167
-I do.
-And you get a bit
of the spotlight.

16:00.250 --> 16:02.378
I get a lot
of the spotlight,

16:02.461 --> 16:04.880
if you haven't been
reading the news lately.

16:04.963 --> 16:06.924
Because his wife
is suing him.

16:07.007 --> 16:08.592
They've settled.

16:08.676 --> 16:12.388
I'm so relieved.

16:12.471 --> 16:15.474
You know what?
Seeing it for the second time--

16:15.557 --> 16:16.892
the third, in fact,

16:16.975 --> 16:19.561
I thought it was
kind of okay.

16:19.645 --> 16:22.648
-Was it?
-Yeah, actually,
I was surprised.

16:27.695 --> 16:29.029
Is something wrong?

16:31.031 --> 16:33.867
No. No. Nothing's wrong.

16:33.951 --> 16:37.371
Honestly,
it wasn't that bad
for that kind of film.

16:37.454 --> 16:40.249
But I definitely don't buy
Edward as Emperor of the Galaxy.

16:40.332 --> 16:42.918
Who can pull off
Emperor of the Galaxy?

16:43.001 --> 16:46.755
-Who's the guy that plays
Gandalf in "Lord of the Rings"?
-Ian McKellen.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.215
I thought it was Michael Gambon.

16:48.298 --> 16:50.551
Michael Gambon plays Dumbledore

16:50.634 --> 16:51.969
in the "Harry Potter" movies.

16:52.052 --> 16:53.595
Ooh, it's not the same actor?

16:53.679 --> 16:57.683
No, Ian McKellen
and Michael Gambon
are not the same actor.

16:57.766 --> 17:00.310
Ooh... okay.
(laughs)

17:00.394 --> 17:02.521
(both laughing)

17:05.482 --> 17:09.236
-When, when is pick-up?
-Six.

17:09.319 --> 17:12.114
That's not happening again.
You have to change that.

17:12.197 --> 17:14.450
I can't.
It's a really
long drive,

17:14.533 --> 17:16.577
and they're shooting
God knows where.

17:16.660 --> 17:19.079
-(elevator dings)
-All right.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.248
You're not coming up?

17:21.331 --> 17:23.584
No, I wanna check if
the pool is still open.

17:23.667 --> 17:27.588
-Regina, it's 2 A.M.
-And?

17:27.671 --> 17:31.300
Uh... forget it.
Nothing. Go ahead.

17:31.383 --> 17:33.135
-Good night.
-Have fun.

17:35.846 --> 17:37.973
(ambient street noise)

17:41.059 --> 17:42.102
-Hello.
-Hi.

17:42.186 --> 17:45.564
Could you please call
Ms. Harberg, room 567?

17:55.574 --> 17:57.159
I was having them
call your room.

17:57.242 --> 17:59.119
We need to go.
We're late.

17:59.203 --> 18:04.124
I couldn't sleep,
so I took some pills.
Then I couldn't wake up.

18:04.208 --> 18:05.375
Well, you can
sleep in the car.

18:05.459 --> 18:08.962
-It's like a three-hour drive.
-I need coffee.

18:25.813 --> 18:28.982
-(light music playing)
-(ambient nature sounds)

18:54.258 --> 18:56.885
This is the body
of Chief Inspector Durtal.

18:58.345 --> 18:59.930
(speaking French)

19:11.191 --> 19:14.236
(speaking French)

20:02.784 --> 20:05.495
(speaking French)

20:14.880 --> 20:15.964
-Hi.
-Hi.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.467
-(both chuckling)
-Finally.

20:18.550 --> 20:23.180
Sorry, uh, I know how, uh,
it can be uncomfortable
as a newcomer on a set.

20:23.263 --> 20:26.058
-Especially since we
just started shooting.
-It's fine.

20:26.141 --> 20:28.727
No, it just takes
a moment to settle in.

20:28.810 --> 20:29.978
Actors are used to it.

20:30.062 --> 20:32.522
I probably should have
given you a warmer welcome,

20:32.606 --> 20:33.607
but you know how it is.

20:33.690 --> 20:36.234
I was trying to get
this shot right--

20:36.318 --> 20:37.903
I know.

20:37.986 --> 20:39.321
It's always a bit awkward

20:39.404 --> 20:40.906
to meet in person
when, uh...

20:40.989 --> 20:43.283
-Totally.
-...y-y-you've only Skyped.

20:43.367 --> 20:45.327
Yeah, and the Wi-Fi
kept cutting in and out.

20:45.410 --> 20:48.622
No, no, but I will
get around to fixing
my Wi-Fi... sometime.

20:48.705 --> 20:51.166
-Mine too. (laughs)
-M-Maybe, maybe.

20:51.250 --> 20:54.127
So. (sighs)

20:54.211 --> 20:57.297
And, uh, I'm sorry
because my, my English
is not so great,

20:57.381 --> 21:02.511
-and, uh... it, uh, it
limits the conversation.
-It's perfect.

21:02.594 --> 21:07.683
I, I did-- I didn't
think you, you, you
would take me seriously.

21:07.766 --> 21:11.228
You didn't need
to convince me.
Um, I'm a fan.

21:11.311 --> 21:12.354
Oh...

21:13.313 --> 21:15.524
As am I.

21:15.607 --> 21:17.818
I was surprised
you knew my films.

21:17.901 --> 21:20.487
Um, you know, I don't
really care about movies.

21:20.570 --> 21:22.656
Um, I used to,
but not anymore.

21:22.739 --> 21:27.077
Uh, maybe it will
come back, but, um...

21:27.160 --> 21:29.913
you, y-you have
a magnetic presence.

21:29.997 --> 21:33.375
Oh. (chuckles)
Even as Nausicaa?

21:33.458 --> 21:34.292
Yeah, totally.

21:34.376 --> 21:35.627
-You glow.
-I, I glow?

21:35.711 --> 21:37.921
-Yeah, you glow. You--
-I-I'm, I'm not

21:38.005 --> 21:39.840
so sure about that...

21:39.923 --> 21:42.718
but I'll take
your word for it.

21:42.801 --> 21:47.055
So, uh, how's it
been goin' so far?
Are you happy?

21:47.139 --> 21:50.767
Oh, Mira, I have
some bad news for you.

21:51.643 --> 21:52.894
I'm never happy.

21:52.978 --> 21:57.733
I, I tried happiness,
but, uh, it's,
it's just not for me.

21:57.816 --> 22:01.445
Okay, so, uh,
let me put it this way.

22:01.528 --> 22:03.697
Is everything going
according to plan?

22:03.780 --> 22:04.990
There is no plan.

22:05.073 --> 22:06.700
-No plan.
-No plan, no.

22:06.783 --> 22:07.784
I hate when
there is a plan.

22:07.868 --> 22:10.203
Uh, my, my, my job
is to screw the plan.

22:10.287 --> 22:12.539
Maybe I can help
you with that.

22:12.622 --> 22:14.332
-Okay.
-Okay. (laughs)

22:14.416 --> 22:17.753
Um, are, are you
familiar with, uh,
Feuillade's first episode?

22:17.836 --> 22:20.547
Uh... yes...

22:20.630 --> 22:22.257
but I haven't
watched it in a while.

22:22.340 --> 22:23.842
I, um, I was in Hawaii,

22:23.925 --> 22:25.343
and I wrapped two weeks ago.

22:25.427 --> 22:28.764
And then I had to go
and promote "Doomsday,"
and--

22:28.847 --> 22:30.015
I'll catch up.

22:30.098 --> 22:30.932
I promise.

22:31.016 --> 22:32.309
It's only about
e-establishing

22:32.392 --> 22:35.145
how ruthless Vampires
can be, um.

22:35.228 --> 22:38.482
They're ruled by an elusive
criminal mastermind,

22:38.565 --> 22:42.360
uh, only known as...
the Grand Vampire,

22:42.444 --> 22:45.655
but he operates under
various aliases.

22:47.157 --> 22:50.660
Yeah, right.
He usually disguises himself
as the Count of Noir--

22:51.870 --> 22:54.456
How do you pronounce it?
Count, Count Noir--

22:54.539 --> 22:57.084
-Nwar-moot-yeah.
-Nwar-moot-yeah.

22:57.167 --> 23:00.003
-Nwar-moot-yeah.
-Count Nwar-moot-yeah.

23:00.087 --> 23:01.254
Le comte.

23:01.338 --> 23:02.631
-Comte. (laughs)
-Noirmoutier.

23:02.714 --> 23:05.133
-Le Comte Noirmoutier.
-Voilà. C'est ça.

23:05.217 --> 23:07.135
-(video plays)
-And, uh, this is
Philippe Guérande,

23:07.219 --> 23:08.637
the journalist.

23:08.720 --> 23:11.598
Um, he's
the Vampires' foe, okay?

23:11.681 --> 23:18.021
And, um...
he exposes the crimes
of the Vampires in the press.

23:18.105 --> 23:23.276
Furious,
the Grand Vampire wants
revenge and threatens him

23:23.360 --> 23:26.613
with the same fate
as Inspector Durtal.

23:29.157 --> 23:32.285
(tense music plays)

23:37.707 --> 23:40.627
(dark organ sting)

23:54.015 --> 23:56.309
Sorry.

23:56.393 --> 23:59.312
-Today is a very busy day.
-No worries.

23:59.396 --> 24:03.150
Especially because
of the severed head scene.

24:03.233 --> 24:08.155
So, um...
Yeah, I, I guess I...

24:08.238 --> 24:12.576
I just need to understand
your approach, you know?

24:12.659 --> 24:15.120
Irma Vep can be seen
from so many angles.

24:15.203 --> 24:16.955
Is she the Grand Vampire's
moll, or--

24:17.038 --> 24:19.332
Oh, but she's
a lot more than that.

24:19.416 --> 24:23.545
Y-Yes, or is she
the... embodiment

24:23.628 --> 24:26.131
of the Vampires'
evil spirit?

24:26.214 --> 24:28.175
You know, it, it
was the first time

24:28.258 --> 24:30.927
a villainess was
the star of a serial.

24:31.011 --> 24:34.598
Uh, we, we are,
uh, in, uh, 1916.

24:34.681 --> 24:36.558
Um, do, d-do, do you know

24:36.641 --> 24:39.477
what was all the rage
in the States then?

24:41.104 --> 24:42.856
"Perils of Pauline."

24:42.939 --> 24:45.025
Ever heard of,
uh, Pearl White?

24:45.108 --> 24:48.820
-No... not really.
-Uh, let me show you something.

24:48.904 --> 24:49.988
Um...

24:54.242 --> 24:55.202
Um...

24:55.285 --> 24:58.747
Look. You see?

24:58.830 --> 25:02.834
Pauline was the ultimate
damsel in distress.

25:02.918 --> 25:08.089
And so, Irma Vep was
Pauline's polar opposite.

25:08.173 --> 25:12.928
She's fascinating
because she's pure evil,

25:13.011 --> 25:15.430
but, uh, in a sexy
kind of way.

25:15.513 --> 25:17.933
-Do you know what I mean?
-I guess so.

25:18.016 --> 25:21.019
Yes, because
villainesses are sexy

25:21.102 --> 25:23.146
in ways good girls are not.

25:23.230 --> 25:25.398
Uh, they don't teach
you that at school.

25:25.482 --> 25:27.275
Don't worry.
Girls just know.

25:27.359 --> 25:30.737
The actress Musidora,
not, not her real name,

25:30.820 --> 25:33.281
was a, a fetish
for a whole generation

25:33.365 --> 25:35.825
cause, uh, Surrealists
worshipped her.

25:35.909 --> 25:38.203
She was a much
more complex figure.

25:38.286 --> 25:42.040
-What do you mean?
-She was an artist,
in her own right.

25:42.123 --> 25:44.334
One of the first
female directors.

25:44.417 --> 25:47.921
True. In France,
we had Alice Guy,

25:48.004 --> 25:50.131
Germaine Dulac, and her.

25:50.215 --> 25:51.466
So, in the '70s,

25:51.549 --> 25:55.845
the first radical, uh,
women's filmmaker collective

25:55.929 --> 26:00.809
was named after her.
Musidora. Musidora.

26:00.892 --> 26:02.644
-Uh-huh.
-Never knew that.

26:02.727 --> 26:04.187
I didn't go
to film school.

26:04.271 --> 26:06.147
Oh, no, it's, it's
local French culture.

26:06.231 --> 26:08.108
You're not supposed
to know, but, uh.

26:08.191 --> 26:11.528
Well, I do know that
she was a novelist

26:11.611 --> 26:12.654
and even a film critic.

26:12.737 --> 26:15.573
She, uh, fell in love
with a bullfighter,

26:15.657 --> 26:18.827
she... shot some
of her movies in Spain.

26:18.910 --> 26:20.495
She was an adventurer.

26:20.578 --> 26:22.455
I've done my research.

26:22.539 --> 26:24.291
Irma Vep was only
one side of her.

26:24.374 --> 26:28.920
Yes, but, um, I also think
everything is in Irma Vep.

26:29.004 --> 26:30.588
Yeah, that's the way
I see it, too.

26:30.672 --> 26:34.634
She's a strong woman,
very sensual... free.

26:36.386 --> 26:38.305
And she's bad.
(chuckles)

26:38.388 --> 26:40.307
-Yes, she is.
-Yeah, she's an outlaw.

26:40.390 --> 26:42.267
-Yeah.
-How can I resist
the opportunity

26:42.350 --> 26:44.144
to pay tribute to an outlaw?

26:44.227 --> 26:45.729
Because, uh, deep down,

26:45.812 --> 26:48.523
you are an outlaw yourself.

26:49.357 --> 26:51.359
It's what we share.

26:52.652 --> 26:54.195
Thanks for the compliment.

26:56.072 --> 26:57.490
But I'm nowhere near her league.

26:57.574 --> 26:59.492
-(bell ringing)
-Man: What happened,
Mr. Guérande?

26:59.576 --> 27:01.661
The Vampires have
a secret passage to my room,

27:01.745 --> 27:04.998
b-but last night,
I discovered their trick.

27:07.917 --> 27:09.794
I'll show you.
It's pretty cunning.

27:09.878 --> 27:13.006

27:26.186 --> 27:27.729

31:13.746 --> 31:16.416
This one is my
favorite photo.
I love this one.

31:16.499 --> 31:19.669
The one with Musidora.

31:19.752 --> 31:22.505
Paul Poiret,
the great fashion
designer back then,

31:22.589 --> 31:24.382
fitted Musidora himself.

31:24.465 --> 31:25.383
Look.

31:26.509 --> 31:28.219
Ah, wow.

31:33.808 --> 31:35.435
Eriberto:
We have to do
as well as he did.

31:35.518 --> 31:39.897
Yep... the line is
perfect, seamless.

31:39.981 --> 31:42.233
Now it's all, leather,
leather, leather.

31:42.317 --> 31:44.110
You take any
of the American actresses,

31:44.193 --> 31:46.112
Scarlett Johansson
in "The Avengers,"

31:46.195 --> 31:48.531
Michelle Pfeiffer,
Halle Berry in "Catwoman,"

31:48.615 --> 31:50.825
and so on, and so on,
and so boring.

31:50.908 --> 31:55.955
That's exactly...
why I chose silver velvet.

31:56.039 --> 31:58.124
It's more sensual.

31:58.207 --> 32:01.544
-Pierre, can you bring
us a sample, please?
-Of course.

32:02.879 --> 32:05.506
Yeah, Irma Vep is
not a, not a superhero.

32:05.590 --> 32:07.759
She doesn't
need body armor.

32:09.594 --> 32:11.679
And, I mean, look...

32:11.763 --> 32:14.974
she's not afraid
of her femininity.

32:15.058 --> 32:18.478
Her femininity is
what scares her foes.

32:22.398 --> 32:24.525
That is stunning.

32:28.404 --> 32:31.157
You'll have to be
careful because it's
extremely fragile.

32:31.240 --> 32:35.328
Uh, y-you do know that
I'm gonna climb roofs

32:35.411 --> 32:37.580
in this costume, right?

32:39.290 --> 32:42.835
It's very different
from what you usually
see in movies.

32:42.919 --> 32:45.380
This is, like,
comfortable.

32:45.463 --> 32:47.256
See how it plays
with the light?

32:47.340 --> 32:49.092
Yeah, stunning.

32:49.801 --> 32:50.760
We have a prototype.

32:50.843 --> 32:53.221
-You want to try it?
-Of course.

32:55.181 --> 32:56.974
(Zoe gasps)

32:57.058 --> 32:59.686
She's the original
movie villainess...

32:59.769 --> 33:02.605
and it's also about
female empowerment.

33:04.023 --> 33:06.776
It's not bad for a first try.

33:06.859 --> 33:09.195
It is a little tight.

33:10.822 --> 33:13.241
-Yeah, we'll fix that.
-Yeah, right here.

33:17.245 --> 33:18.996
Zoe:
Love it.

33:19.080 --> 33:20.998
She seems vulnerable,

33:21.082 --> 33:23.334
and that makes her
all the more dangerous.

33:23.418 --> 33:25.962
Sure.
She was wicked.

33:26.045 --> 33:28.798
Eriberto:
She unleashed
Feuillade's fantasies.

33:28.881 --> 33:31.300
Individually,
they had their limits,

33:31.384 --> 33:33.511
but together,
they made film history.

33:33.594 --> 33:38.099
The ghost of Irma Vep
has been haunting
cinema ever since.

53:24.117 --> 53:26.661
-Wow.
-Oh, thank you.

53:26.745 --> 53:28.997
Now I understand why
it took some time.

53:29.080 --> 53:31.374
Well, I did
say 6:30-ish.

53:31.458 --> 53:33.919
Well, the "-ish" ended
about 40 minutes ago.

53:34.002 --> 53:35.962
I had dresses that
needed alterations,

53:36.046 --> 53:37.714
and they just kept me
waiting and waiting,

53:37.797 --> 53:39.841
but...
I'm used to that.

53:39.925 --> 53:41.468
I often waited
for your dresses.

53:41.551 --> 53:43.678
-True.
-Waiter: Would you
like to order, Madam?

53:43.762 --> 53:46.806
Um, no, actually,
I'm, I'm fine.

53:46.890 --> 53:50.560
I... I should be
going actually.

53:52.562 --> 53:55.732
Are you fucking
kidding me?

53:55.815 --> 53:57.484
I have dinner
with Herman.

53:57.567 --> 54:00.946
It's our last night in Paris.
We go back to LA tomorrow.

54:01.029 --> 54:05.075
He booked this amazing
reservation somewhere,
but he won't tell me where.

54:05.158 --> 54:08.203
He wants it
to be a surprise.
How cute is that?

54:08.286 --> 54:11.706
-Yeah, how kind of him.
-He's a kind man.

54:11.790 --> 54:14.626
Well... I have to go,

54:14.709 --> 54:18.713
but we'll have
more time in LA.

54:18.797 --> 54:24.094
-Will we?
-Yeah, I think we're in a more
balanced relationship now,

54:24.177 --> 54:26.680
so we could spend
more time together.

54:26.763 --> 54:28.056
Fuck you, Laurie.

54:28.139 --> 54:29.432
Not yet.
