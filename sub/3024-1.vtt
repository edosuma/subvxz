01:02.980 --> 01:05.272
There he is! Let's get him.

01:05.649 --> 01:06.941
Come on.

03:08.018 --> 03:09.978
Verifying materialization sequence.

03:10.563 --> 03:12.564
Bring up resolution on radar unit 12.

03:14.483 --> 03:16.818
- Area 7 to Command.
- Go ahead.

03:16.902 --> 03:18.902
We could use another survey team
out here, sir.

03:18.987 --> 03:21.738
Base to Ensign McCauley
and Ensign Gilles.

03:21.823 --> 03:25.117
Please report to Area 7
and assist the edaphology team.

03:25.201 --> 03:26.702
Acknowledged.

03:27.161 --> 03:30.205
Transferring anthropometric data files
to secondary processor.

03:30.290 --> 03:34.209
- Ethnographic studies indicate 97%...
- The ecological analysis...

03:38.047 --> 03:40.966
Still working on correlating
that unidentified...

03:41.050 --> 03:43.510
The comparative linguistic analysis
is complete, sir.

03:47.974 --> 03:51.143
Admiral Dougherty is waiting for this.
Transmit it to the ship.

03:51.227 --> 03:52.936
Alert! Area 12!

04:01.820 --> 04:05.281
- The android, he's out of control.
- Report.

04:05.574 --> 04:09.452
He's headed toward the village.
We're trying to stop him.

04:09.995 --> 04:11.412
Over there!

04:13.707 --> 04:14.999
Magnify.

04:22.716 --> 04:23.841
Hold your fire.

04:26.094 --> 04:28.387
What is it? What's happening?

04:33.310 --> 04:35.144
Base to Commander Data.

04:35.228 --> 04:38.897
Rerouting micro-hydraulic
power distribution.

04:40.358 --> 04:44.235
- Regulating thermal overload.
- Data, report to Base immediately!

04:44.362 --> 04:48.990
Transferring positronic matrix functions.
Engaging secondary protocol.

04:49.075 --> 04:51.701
He's trying to remove the headpiece.

04:52.078 --> 04:54.913
All field units, intercept the android.

05:02.046 --> 05:03.588
Artim, Artim, it's all right.

05:09.887 --> 05:11.554
Get inside. Now.

05:22.899 --> 05:27.569
Find shelter. Everyone, get inside. Now.
Back to your homes! Move it!

05:28.780 --> 05:30.155
Now! Move!

05:30.573 --> 05:32.491
Secondary protocol is active.

05:32.575 --> 05:35.077
- They can see him.
- Stop him! Now!

05:45.255 --> 05:50.801
Commander Data, stand down.
That's an order! I repeat, stand down!

06:24.835 --> 06:26.335
Who are they?

06:49.400 --> 06:52.861
It's an M-Class planet.
Population, 300 million.

06:52.945 --> 06:55.572
- Say the greeting again.
- Yew-cheen chef-faw.

06:55.656 --> 06:57.949
Emphasis on the "cheen" and the "faw."

06:58.034 --> 06:59.993
You either need a new uniform
or a new neck.

07:01.579 --> 07:04.539
My collar size is exactly as it was
at the Academy.

07:04.624 --> 07:06.291
Of course it is.

07:06.834 --> 07:07.876
Our guests have arrived.

07:07.960 --> 07:10.419
They are eating the floral arrangements
on the banquet tables.

07:10.504 --> 07:12.671
I guess they don't believe in cocktails
before dinner.

07:12.756 --> 07:15.299
Oh, my God! Are they vegetarian?
That's not in there.

07:15.383 --> 07:18.719
Perhaps we should have the chef
whip up a light balsamic vinaigrette,

07:18.804 --> 07:21.889
something that goes well
with chrysanthemums.

07:25.977 --> 07:28.229
- Bridge to Captain Picard.
- Go ahead, Ensign.

07:28.313 --> 07:30.439
Command wants to know our ETA
at the Goren system.

07:30.524 --> 07:31.607
The Goren system?

07:31.691 --> 07:33.651
They need us to mediate
some territorial dispute.

07:33.735 --> 07:34.819
No, no.

07:34.903 --> 07:37.321
We can't delay the archeological
expedition to Hanoran II.

07:37.405 --> 07:39.365
That'll put us right in the middle
of the monsoon season.

07:39.449 --> 07:41.242
- Captain.
- Thank you.

07:41.326 --> 07:43.702
The diplomatic corps is busy
with Dominion negotiations.

07:43.787 --> 07:47.456
Yes. So they need us
to put out one more brush fire.

07:48.333 --> 07:51.626
Can anyone remember
when we used to be explorers?

07:53.129 --> 07:55.588
- Deck 10.
- Yew-cheen chef-faw.

07:55.673 --> 07:59.134
Remember, they have a significantly
less advanced technology than ours.

07:59.218 --> 08:01.386
They only achieved warp drive last year.

08:01.470 --> 08:04.722
And the Federation Council decided
to make them a protectorate so quickly.

08:04.807 --> 08:06.641
In view of our losses
to the Borg and the Dominion,

08:06.725 --> 08:10.812
the Council feels we need all the allies
we can get these days.

08:11.605 --> 08:13.273
Captain on deck.

08:19.113 --> 08:22.115
You'll be expected to dance
with the Regent Cuzar.

08:22.199 --> 08:25.034
- Can she mambo?
- Very funny.

08:25.119 --> 08:26.661
The Captain used to cut quite a rug.

08:26.745 --> 08:27.870
La Forge to Picard.

08:27.954 --> 08:30.164
Captain, I need to talk to you
before the reception.

08:30.248 --> 08:31.999
- Captain. Doctor.
- Mr. Worf!

08:32.082 --> 08:34.293
- Worf.
- What the hell are you doing here?

08:34.376 --> 08:36.253
- I was at the Manzar colony...
- He's a little late, Geordi.

08:36.337 --> 08:37.504
- Can it wait?
- I don't think so.

08:37.589 --> 08:39.631
Excuse me.
Tell him that I'm already here,

08:39.716 --> 08:41.924
and I'll talk to him when he arrives.
Mr. Worf, I have...

08:42.010 --> 08:43.594
Geordi, the Captain would like you
to come up here.

08:43.678 --> 08:48.557
Tell him we've received a communiqué
from Admiral Dougherty. It's about Data.

08:58.985 --> 09:02.821
Yew-cheen chef-faw, Regent Cuzar.
Welcome aboard the Enterprise.

09:02.906 --> 09:04.156
Captain Picard,

09:04.240 --> 09:08.242
may I welcome you in the time-honored
tradition of my people?

09:16.877 --> 09:21.297
We are so honored to be accepted
within the great Federation family.

09:21.548 --> 09:25.301
- We have a dance later, I believe.
- I look forward to it.

09:33.435 --> 09:36.145
- Counselor.
- Nice bead work.

09:36.230 --> 09:38.481
Captain. Excuse me. Captain.

09:40.067 --> 09:43.236
Captain, Admiral Dougherty
is aboard a Son'a ship in Sector 441.

09:43.320 --> 09:46.238
- He's requesting Data's schematics.
- Is something wrong?

09:46.322 --> 09:47.489
The message doesn't say.

09:47.573 --> 09:49.115
Data should have been back by now.

09:49.200 --> 09:52.244
They were only scheduled to observe
the Ba'ku village for one week.

09:52.328 --> 09:54.246
Geordi, would you set up
a secure comm link

09:54.330 --> 09:56.665
- with the Admiral in the anteroom?
- Aye, sir.

09:57.208 --> 09:59.042
Captain, Hars Adislo.

09:59.126 --> 10:01.670
We met
at the Nel Bato Conference last year.

10:01.754 --> 10:03.463
Did you ever have a chance
to read my paper

10:03.547 --> 10:05.924
on thermionic transconductance?

10:06.300 --> 10:08.134
Would you excuse me?

10:13.516 --> 10:15.725
He's not acknowledging
any Starfleet protocols,

10:15.810 --> 10:18.144
not responding to any of our hails.

10:18.229 --> 10:20.563
Have you any idea
what precipitated this behavior?

10:20.648 --> 10:24.149
None. Now he's holding our people
hostage down there.

10:24.985 --> 10:27.653
Well, the Enterprise could be
at your position in two days, Admiral.

10:27.737 --> 10:29.697
That's probably not a good idea.

10:29.781 --> 10:31.740
Your ship hasn't been fitted
for this region.

10:31.825 --> 10:34.493
There are environmental concerns.

10:34.828 --> 10:36.120
What kind of concerns?

10:36.204 --> 10:38.330
We haven't fully identified
the anomalies yet.

10:38.415 --> 10:41.041
They're calling this whole area
the Briar Patch.

10:41.126 --> 10:42.626
Took us a day to reach a location

10:42.711 --> 10:45.004
where we could even get a signal
to you.

10:45.088 --> 10:49.675
Just get me Data's schematics.
I'll keep you informed. Dougherty out.

10:56.558 --> 10:59.727
- His emotion chip?
- He didn't take it with him.

11:00.228 --> 11:03.271
- Send the Admiral Data's schematics.
- Aye, sir.

11:06.483 --> 11:08.401
- Yes, sir?
- Ensign, would you report to the galley

11:08.485 --> 11:10.653
and tell the chef to skip the fish course?

11:10.738 --> 11:11.863
Aye, sir.

11:11.947 --> 11:15.366
I would like our guests to depart
as soon as etiquette allows.

11:15.451 --> 11:19.245
I'm going to ask Worf to delay his return
to DS9 so that he can join us.

11:19.330 --> 11:22.623
We're gonna stop by Sector 441
on our way to the Goren system.

11:22.708 --> 11:26.002
- They are in opposite directions, sir.
- Are they?

11:46.064 --> 11:50.776
I never should have let you talk me
into that duck blind in the first place.

11:50.985 --> 11:53.195
Your Federation procedures
have made this mission

11:53.279 --> 11:55.614
ten times as difficult as it needed to be.

11:55.698 --> 11:58.992
Our procedures were in place
to protect the planet's population

11:59.077 --> 12:00.994
from unnecessary risk.

12:01.079 --> 12:03.830
Planet's population, 600 people.

12:06.292 --> 12:11.296
If you want to avoid unnecessary risks,
next time, leave your android at home.

12:11.381 --> 12:14.508
Bridge to Ahdar Ru'afo.
We are approaching the planet.

12:14.592 --> 12:16.635
Take us into a high orbit.

12:16.969 --> 12:21.305
Lie down, Admiral.
The girls'll take 20 years off your face.

12:21.598 --> 12:26.685
- Another time, perhaps.
- Your self-restraint puzzles me, Admiral.

12:26.978 --> 12:31.649
You continue to deny yourself
every benefit this mission has to offer.

12:32.109 --> 12:34.860
I prefer to wait
until we can share the benefits

12:34.945 --> 12:37.696
with all the people of the Federation.

12:41.243 --> 12:43.911
- Report.
- Phaser blast. Unknown origin.

12:43.995 --> 12:45.538
Raise shields.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.837
- Take us out of orbit.
- Photon torpedoes. Brace for impact.

12:56.967 --> 13:00.051
- The vessel has broken off pursuit, sir.
- Visual contact.

13:04.140 --> 13:05.807
That's our ship.

13:26.078 --> 13:28.955
Captain, we're about to lose
all communications with Starfleet.

13:29.039 --> 13:30.457
Do you have everything you need
from Command?

13:30.541 --> 13:33.168
I've downloaded all the files
on the duck blind mission

13:33.252 --> 13:36.753
- and the Son'a.
- You have two days to become experts.

13:39.716 --> 13:43.677
Mr. Worf, our job is to come up
with a plan to safely capture Data.

13:43.761 --> 13:46.889
I've already had Commander La Forge
modify this tricorder

13:46.973 --> 13:49.266
with one of Data's actuation servos.

13:49.392 --> 13:53.770
Its operational range is only 4 meters,
but it will shut him down.

13:55.398 --> 13:57.774
Good to have you back, Mr. Worf.

13:59.235 --> 14:01.904
Slow to one-third. Take us in.

14:15.083 --> 14:18.211
Half a century ago,
they conquered two primitive races,

14:18.295 --> 14:20.671
the Tarlac and the Ellora,

14:20.756 --> 14:24.759
and then integrated them
into their culture as a labor class.

14:26.303 --> 14:27.386
Look at this.

14:27.471 --> 14:29.222
The Son'a are known to have produced

14:29.306 --> 14:32.767
mass quantities
of the narcotic ketracel-white.

14:35.687 --> 14:37.188
Their ships are rumored
to be equipped

14:37.272 --> 14:38.814
with isolytic subspace weapons

14:38.941 --> 14:41.025
outlawed by
the Second Khitomer Accord.

14:41.109 --> 14:43.027
Why would we be involved
with these people?

14:43.111 --> 14:44.779
Good question.

14:48.951 --> 14:51.619
- You haven't done that in a long time.
- What?

14:51.954 --> 14:54.454
- What you're doing to my neck.
- Was I doing something to your neck?

15:01.295 --> 15:03.338
Bridge to Commander Worf.

15:05.800 --> 15:07.259
- Worf!
- Captain.

15:07.510 --> 15:09.719
I don't know how they do it
on Deep Space Nine,

15:09.804 --> 15:13.473
but on the Enterprise,
we still report for duty on time.

15:16.811 --> 15:21.147
- Sorry, sir. I'm on my way.
- We'll skip the court-martial this time.

15:21.482 --> 15:22.816
Picard out.

15:26.195 --> 15:29.489
When was the last time
we aligned the torque sensors?

15:29.574 --> 15:32.700
- Two months ago, sir.
- They don't sound right.

15:33.660 --> 15:37.329
The torque sensors
are out of alignment by 12 microns.

15:38.081 --> 15:39.415
You could hear that?

15:39.499 --> 15:43.544
When I was an ensign, I could detect
a three-micron misalignment.

15:43.670 --> 15:46.130
Excuse me, sir. The Son'a ship
with Admiral Dougherty aboard

15:46.214 --> 15:48.382
has entered tracking range.

15:50.343 --> 15:53.512
Straighten your baldric, Commander.
On screen.

15:54.222 --> 15:56.849
Captain, I wasn't expecting you.

15:57.517 --> 16:00.853
This is too important for the Enterprise
to be on the sidelines, Admiral.

16:00.937 --> 16:02.980
I wish I had better news.

16:03.064 --> 16:06.317
Commander Data attacked us
in a mission scout ship yesterday.

16:06.401 --> 16:09.403
Ru'afo and I have decided
to send in an assault team.

16:11.030 --> 16:14.073
Commander Worf and I are working
on several tactical plans to see...

16:14.199 --> 16:17.660
Your android has turned
dangerously violent, Captain.

16:17.745 --> 16:21.372
Considerable damage was done
to my ship. He must be destroyed.

16:21.874 --> 16:24.208
I know what Data means to Starfleet,
Jean-Luc,

16:24.293 --> 16:27.295
but our crew is at the mercy
of those people on the planet.

16:28.547 --> 16:31.549
If our first attempt to capture Data fails,

16:33.218 --> 16:35.053
I will terminate him.

16:35.596 --> 16:39.599
I should be the one to do it.
I'm his captain and his friend.

16:42.603 --> 16:47.899
All right, you have 12 hours, Captain.
Then I want you out of the Briar Patch.

16:47.983 --> 16:49.941
In the meantime,
we'll head out to the perimeter

16:50.068 --> 16:53.278
to call for Son'a reinforcements
in case you fail.

16:53.404 --> 16:57.991
- Understood.
- Good luck, Captain. Dougherty out.

17:08.836 --> 17:11.213
Sensors are not picking up any ships
coming from the surface.

17:11.297 --> 17:15.800
Transmit a wideband covariant signal.
That ought to get his attention.

17:15.926 --> 17:18.345
He must be using the planet's rings
to mask his approach.

17:18.429 --> 17:21.723
The metaphasic radiation from the rings
is in a state of extreme flux.

17:21.808 --> 17:23.266
We'll steer clear of those.

17:26.771 --> 17:30.773
Come out, come out, wherever you are

17:31.108 --> 17:32.274
Sir?

17:33.110 --> 17:35.653
That's something that my mother...

17:37.280 --> 17:38.572
Hold on.

17:44.996 --> 17:47.289
Open all hailing frequencies.

17:48.458 --> 17:50.418
Data, this is Captain Picard.

17:51.128 --> 17:53.003
Data, please respond.

17:59.344 --> 18:00.428
If we fire tachyon bursts,

18:00.512 --> 18:02.513
it might force him
to reset his shield harmonics.

18:02.639 --> 18:06.808
- When he does, we can beam him out.
- Make it so.

18:11.856 --> 18:14.482
Direct hit.
He's resetting his shield harmonics.

18:14.608 --> 18:16.109
Beam him out.

18:21.866 --> 18:25.827
- He has activated a transport inhibitor.
- Prepare to enter the atmosphere.

18:25.953 --> 18:27.829
We'll use the ionospheric boundary
to shake him.

18:34.712 --> 18:36.045
Scanners are off-line.

18:36.338 --> 18:39.841
Evasive maneuvers,
heading 1-4-0 mark 3-1.

19:01.029 --> 19:05.282
He can fly a ship.
He can anticipate tactical strategies.

19:05.366 --> 19:07.117
Clearly his brain is functioning.

19:07.202 --> 19:11.705
We've seen how he responds to threats.
I wonder how he would respond...

19:14.918 --> 19:17.628
Mr. Worf,
do you know Gilbert and Sullivan?

19:17.712 --> 19:20.255
No, sir, I have not had a chance
to meet all the new crew members

19:20.381 --> 19:22.382
since I have been back.

19:24.760 --> 19:28.179
They're composers, Worf,
from the 19th century.

19:33.936 --> 19:37.563
Data was rehearsing a production
of H.M.S. Pinafore just before he left.

19:37.940 --> 19:41.400
A British tar is a soaring soul

19:41.527 --> 19:43.903
As free as a mountain bird

19:44.446 --> 19:47.824
His energetic fist
should be ready to resist

19:47.908 --> 19:50.117
A dictatorial word

19:50.244 --> 19:51.327
Sing, Worf, sing.

19:51.411 --> 19:52.829
His nose should pant

19:52.913 --> 19:54.330
And his lip should curl

19:54.414 --> 19:55.957
His cheeks should flame

19:56.083 --> 19:57.583
And his brow should furl

19:57.918 --> 19:59.418
His bosom should heave

19:59.545 --> 20:01.170
And his heart should glow

20:01.255 --> 20:05.215
And his fist be ever ready
for a knockdown blow

20:05.299 --> 20:08.760
His nose should pant
And his lip should curl

20:08.970 --> 20:11.388
His cheeks should flame
and his brow should furl

20:11.472 --> 20:13.932
His bosom should heave
and his heart should glow

20:14.058 --> 20:17.269
And his fist be ever ready
for a knockdown blow

20:17.603 --> 20:19.563
Prepare the docking clamps.

20:19.647 --> 20:22.899
His eyes should flash with an inborn fire

20:22.984 --> 20:25.902
His brow with scorn be wrung

20:25.987 --> 20:29.072
He never should bow down
to a domineering frown

20:29.156 --> 20:32.492
- Or the tang of a tyrant tongue
- Or the tang of a tyrant tongue

20:32.618 --> 20:33.952
His heart should stamp

20:34.161 --> 20:35.829
And his throat should growl

20:35.955 --> 20:37.372
His hair should curl

20:37.623 --> 20:39.207
And his face should scowl

20:39.292 --> 20:40.792
His eyes should flash

20:40.918 --> 20:42.376
And his breast protrude

20:42.627 --> 20:46.422
And this should be
his customary attitude

20:47.132 --> 20:50.968
His foot should stamp
And his throat should growl

20:51.094 --> 20:53.804
His hair should curl and his face...

20:55.849 --> 20:57.975
Inertial coupling is exceeding tolerance.

20:58.101 --> 21:00.769
If we do not release him,
he may destroy both vessels.

21:00.854 --> 21:02.146
I'm not letting go of him.

21:07.485 --> 21:11.822
- We must stabilize the damping field.
- Reroute emergency power

21:11.948 --> 21:13.407
to inertial dampers.

21:13.491 --> 21:15.993
The auto-sequencer was damaged
by phaser fire.

21:16.077 --> 21:17.828
Transferring controls to manual.

21:25.002 --> 21:27.837
Power sequence realigned.
Engaging stabilizers.

21:28.005 --> 21:31.507
- Damping field established.
- Maximum power.

21:42.102 --> 21:43.603
Now, Mr. Worf.

21:57.952 --> 21:59.409
Captain, Commander Data is safely
in custody.

22:34.696 --> 22:38.072
Captain, Subahdar Gallatin,
Son'a Command.

22:38.156 --> 22:40.574
Lieutenant Curtis,
attaché to Admiral Dougherty.

22:40.701 --> 22:44.328
- Are you all right?
- We've been treated extremely well.

22:45.998 --> 22:50.376
They have incredible mental discipline,
clarity of perception.

22:50.585 --> 22:53.754
- My name is Sojef.
- Jean-Luc Picard.

22:53.839 --> 22:56.841
These are my officers,
Dr. Crusher, Counselor Troi.

22:56.925 --> 23:01.595
- Would you like something to eat?
- No, we're here to rescue them.

23:03.932 --> 23:07.727
As you wish, but I would ask you
to disarm yourselves.

23:08.270 --> 23:10.896
This village is a sanctuary of life.

23:15.068 --> 23:17.360
Prepare the hostages for transport
to the ship.

23:17.445 --> 23:21.573
They should be quarantined
before joining the ship's population.

23:25.870 --> 23:29.289
We were under the impression
they were being held against their will.

23:29.415 --> 23:31.791
It's not our custom
to have guests here at all,

23:31.876 --> 23:33.793
let alone hold anyone against their will.

23:33.919 --> 23:36.880
The artificial life-form
would not allow them to leave.

23:36.964 --> 23:40.633
In fact, he told us they were our enemies
and that more would follow.

23:40.718 --> 23:43.053
- Are you our enemy?
- Anij.

23:43.137 --> 23:46.639
My people have a strict policy
of non-interference in other cultures.

23:46.724 --> 23:48.558
It's our Prime Directive.

23:48.642 --> 23:52.979
Your directive apparently
doesn't include spying on other cultures.

23:55.648 --> 23:58.400
The artificial life-form
is a member of my crew.

23:58.485 --> 24:00.569
Apparently, he was taken ill.

24:00.653 --> 24:03.238
There was a phase variance
in his positronic matrix

24:03.323 --> 24:05.657
which we were unable to repair.

24:05.784 --> 24:07.659
I think the Captain
finds it hard to believe

24:07.786 --> 24:11.080
that we'd have any skills
repairing a positronic device.

24:11.164 --> 24:13.332
Our technological abilities
are not apparent

24:13.416 --> 24:16.502
because we have chosen
not to employ them in our daily lives.

24:16.628 --> 24:19.838
We believe that when you create
a machine to do the work of a man,

24:19.964 --> 24:21.840
you take something away from the man.

24:21.925 --> 24:25.594
But at one time, we explored the galaxy,
just as you do.

24:26.262 --> 24:29.681
- You have warp capability?
- Capability, yes.

24:30.683 --> 24:34.352
But where can warp drive take us
except away from here?

24:44.863 --> 24:47.198
I apologize for our intrusion.

24:56.708 --> 24:59.127
And because they have warp capability,

24:59.211 --> 25:01.754
the consequences
to their society will be minimal.

25:01.839 --> 25:03.923
You've done a terrific job, Jean-Luc.

25:04.007 --> 25:07.552
Now pack your bags
and get the hell out of there.

25:07.636 --> 25:08.970
How's Data?

25:09.054 --> 25:12.430
In stasis.
La Forge is completing the diagnostic.

25:12.515 --> 25:15.517
I'll need all your paperwork tomorrow.
We're heading back your way.

25:15.601 --> 25:16.852
Set a course to rendezvous with us,

25:16.936 --> 25:20.355
so you can transfer the crew
and equipment on your way out.

25:20.439 --> 25:22.232
You're not finished here?

25:22.316 --> 25:26.236
Just a few loose ends to tie up.
Dougherty out.

25:54.723 --> 25:56.015
Come in.

25:59.019 --> 26:00.895
- Hi.
- You got a minute?

26:02.230 --> 26:03.397
Sure.

26:05.442 --> 26:06.901
I need a little counseling.

26:07.444 --> 26:09.695
Well, there's a first time for everything.

26:10.530 --> 26:12.156
So, do I lie down or what?

26:12.949 --> 26:15.159
Well, whatever makes you comfortable,

26:15.243 --> 26:18.871
but this isn't one of the usual
therapeutic postures.

26:19.039 --> 26:22.708
- But it is comfortable.
- Why don't you try sitting up?

26:23.752 --> 26:25.461
Why don't you try lying down?

26:26.671 --> 26:28.838
Well, you're in quite a mood today.

26:29.548 --> 26:32.592
Do you really need counseling
or did you come down here to play?

26:32.676 --> 26:35.595
- I think I'm having a midlife crisis.
- I believe you.

26:35.721 --> 26:36.846
I'm not sleeping well.

26:36.931 --> 26:39.140
Dr. Crusher has something
that can take care of that.

26:39.225 --> 26:41.643
What I need,
I can't get from Dr. Crusher.

26:42.853 --> 26:46.648
Counselor, do you think it's possible
for two people to go back in time,

26:47.316 --> 26:48.775
fix a mistake they've made?

26:49.151 --> 26:51.694
On this ship, anything's possible.

26:55.366 --> 26:57.325
- Yuck!
- Yuck?

26:57.826 --> 27:02.205
- I never kissed you with a beard before.
- I kiss you and you say "yuck"?

27:09.712 --> 27:12.881
I had to reconstruct Data's neural net
and replace these.

27:12.966 --> 27:14.341
They contain memory engrams.

27:14.425 --> 27:16.677
- How were they damaged?
- By a Son'a weapon.

27:16.761 --> 27:20.347
There's no doubt about it, Captain.
That's what caused Data to malfunction.

27:20.431 --> 27:22.474
But the Son'a report claims
that they didn't fire

27:22.558 --> 27:23.809
until after he malfunctioned.

27:23.893 --> 27:26.270
Well, I don't believe
it happened that way.

27:27.897 --> 27:30.148
Why would they fire on him
without provocation?

27:30.233 --> 27:32.901
All I know is that he was
functioning normally until he was shot.

27:32.986 --> 27:34.444
Then his fail-safe system was activated.

27:34.529 --> 27:35.612
Fail-safe?

27:35.697 --> 27:38.699
His ethical and moral subroutines
took over all of his basic functions.

27:38.783 --> 27:40.492
But you're saying
that he still knew the difference

27:40.576 --> 27:41.702
between right and wrong.

27:41.786 --> 27:43.370
In a sense, that's all he knew.

27:43.454 --> 27:44.913
The system is designed to protect Data

27:44.998 --> 27:47.498
against anyone who might try
to take advantage of his memory loss.

27:47.582 --> 27:50.584
And yet he attacked us, and
he told the Ba'ku that we were a threat.

27:51.628 --> 27:55.423
- Are the implants bothering you?
- I'm all right. I think I'm just tired.

28:06.268 --> 28:10.479
- Geordi? Captain?
- You're on the Enterprise, Data.

28:12.232 --> 28:15.067
I seem to be missing
several memory engrams.

28:16.278 --> 28:17.570
There they are.

28:23.243 --> 28:25.827
Data, what's the last thing
that you remember?

28:26.537 --> 28:29.497
His nose should pant
and his lips should curl

28:30.041 --> 28:31.416
From the mission.

28:32.084 --> 28:33.418
I was in an isolation suit

28:33.502 --> 28:35.754
gathering physiometric data
on the Ba'ku.

28:36.339 --> 28:39.049
My last memory is going into the hills
following some children.

28:45.723 --> 28:49.351
Artim, do you remember where
you were on the day of lightning

28:49.435 --> 28:51.644
when the artificial life-form
appeared to us?

28:51.729 --> 28:54.814
- In the hills by the dam.
- Can you show us?

29:13.249 --> 29:15.125
There is no reason to fear me.

29:15.460 --> 29:17.878
I am now operating
within normal parameters.

29:17.962 --> 29:19.630
- What?
- They fixed me.

29:24.469 --> 29:29.056
- Captain, the boy is afraid of me.
- It's nothing personal, Data.

29:29.182 --> 29:32.351
You have to remember,
these people have rejected technology.

29:32.727 --> 29:35.521
I am the personification of everything
they have rejected.

29:35.605 --> 29:38.732
Until this week, that young man
probably never saw a machine,

29:38.817 --> 29:40.859
let alone one that walks and talks.

29:48.742 --> 29:50.034
Bridge to Riker.

29:51.870 --> 29:53.454
Can I get back to you, Mr. Worf?

29:53.539 --> 29:55.832
Admiral Dougherty
is on the comm link, sir.

29:56.583 --> 29:59.794
Patch him through. Yes, Admiral?

29:59.878 --> 30:01.671
Why haven't you left orbit?

30:01.755 --> 30:03.631
Captain Picard
is still on the surface, sir.

30:03.715 --> 30:04.882
Doing what?

30:04.967 --> 30:06.926
He didn't want to leave
until we could adequately explain

30:07.010 --> 30:08.302
why Data malfunctioned.

30:08.637 --> 30:10.221
His future in Starfleet
could depend on it.

30:13.892 --> 30:16.477
Remind the Captain his 12 hours are up.

30:17.146 --> 30:19.605
- Yes, sir.
- Dougherty out.

30:24.318 --> 30:26.528
Your body is producing
far too many toxins.

30:27.697 --> 30:29.865
We've reached the limit
of genetic manipulation.

30:31.617 --> 30:34.161
I won't need anymore
genetic manipulation

30:34.745 --> 30:38.832
if our Federation friends will allow us
to complete this mission.

30:48.718 --> 30:49.968
Tricorder functions are limited

30:50.052 --> 30:53.180
due to heavy deposits of kelbonite
in these hills.

30:53.973 --> 30:56.558
How about a passive radiation scan?

30:59.311 --> 31:00.352
Curious.

31:00.729 --> 31:04.148
There appear to be strong neutrino
emissions coming from the lake.

31:21.500 --> 31:25.836
- Can he breathe underwater?
- Data doesn't breathe.

31:28.548 --> 31:32.259
- Won't he rust?
- No.

31:56.700 --> 31:58.952
Captain! Captain!

31:59.370 --> 32:02.330
I believe I know what is causing
the neutrino emissions.

32:41.411 --> 32:44.371
The vessel is clearly Federation
in origin, Captain.

32:45.665 --> 32:47.749
"Just a few loose ends to tie up."

32:50.336 --> 32:53.255
- We're not interested in such things.
- I am.

32:57.092 --> 33:00.511
- I think it would be wiser if you didn't...
- I'm going with you.

33:49.894 --> 33:51.895
It is a holographic projection.

33:57.777 --> 33:59.819
Incomplete, I might add.

34:00.571 --> 34:02.739
What you're seeing
is a computer-driven image

34:02.823 --> 34:04.741
created by photons and force fields.

34:04.825 --> 34:06.951
I know what a hologram is, Captain.

34:08.579 --> 34:11.998
The question is, why would anyone
want to create one of our village?

34:12.666 --> 34:16.752
Data, if you were following the children
and discovered this ship...

34:18.588 --> 34:22.091
It is conceivable, I was shot to protect
the secret of its existence.

34:22.175 --> 34:27.179
Why would they duplicate this village
except to deceive the Ba'ku?

34:28.264 --> 34:31.016
- Deceive us?
- To move you off this planet.

34:31.851 --> 34:34.268
You go to sleep one night in the village,

34:35.105 --> 34:38.107
wake up the next morning
on this flying holodeck,

34:39.275 --> 34:42.695
transported en masse.
Within a few days,

34:43.029 --> 34:46.824
they're relocated on a similar planet
without ever realizing it.

34:47.826 --> 34:51.119
Why would the Federation
or the Son'a wish to move the Ba'ku?

34:52.955 --> 34:54.455
I don't know.

35:32.243 --> 35:35.829
Computer, end program.
Decloak the vessel.

35:38.541 --> 35:41.668
Help! I can't swim!

35:50.094 --> 35:51.511
Don't panic.

35:52.680 --> 35:54.347
I've been shot at,

35:54.432 --> 35:57.267
thrown into the lake out of a ship
that's come to abduct us.

35:57.351 --> 35:59.019
What's there to panic about?

36:01.022 --> 36:02.230
In the event of a water landing,

36:02.356 --> 36:04.858
I have been designed to serve
as a floatation device.

36:12.032 --> 36:15.075
Mr. Worf, did the hostages
mention anything about a cloaked ship

36:15.202 --> 36:16.827
during their debriefing?

36:16.912 --> 36:18.788
- No, sir.
- Debrief them again.

36:19.372 --> 36:23.417
- Have you been in a fight, Mr. Worf?
- No, sir. It is a gorch.

36:23.919 --> 36:25.085
A gorch?

36:27.088 --> 36:28.547
A pimple, sir.

36:32.093 --> 36:35.221
Well, it's hardly noticeable.

36:51.195 --> 36:53.196
Smooth as an android's bottom,
eh, Data?

36:53.280 --> 36:54.531
I beg your pardon, sir?

36:54.615 --> 36:56.449
Admiral Dougherty wants to know
why we haven't left yet.

36:56.575 --> 36:57.909
We're not going anywhere.

36:59.245 --> 37:00.537
Deck 5.

37:04.917 --> 37:07.252
You Klingons never do anything small,
do you?

37:08.921 --> 37:11.548
Dr. Crusher asked to speak to you
when you returned.

37:13.551 --> 37:15.385
- Picard to Crusher.
- Captain.

37:15.469 --> 37:18.346
The Son'a hostages
declined to be examined.

37:18.430 --> 37:20.098
I had them confined to quarters.

37:20.224 --> 37:21.808
- And our people?
- They're fine.

37:21.934 --> 37:23.476
In fact, they're better than fine.

37:23.602 --> 37:26.562
Increased metabolism,
improved muscle tone, high energy.

37:26.771 --> 37:28.105
We should all be so lucky.

37:28.940 --> 37:30.774
Very well, Doctor. Picard out.

37:31.734 --> 37:34.862
Worf, don't release the Son'a officers
till I've talked to Ahdar Ru'afo.

37:34.946 --> 37:36.113
Aye, sir.

37:36.781 --> 37:39.283
Commander, may I...

37:47.417 --> 37:48.458
Computer, music.

37:49.502 --> 37:53.171
- No. Not that, something Latin.
- Specify.

37:53.464 --> 37:54.798
The mambo.

37:59.470 --> 38:00.929
That's more like it.

38:23.160 --> 38:24.535
How old are you?

38:27.372 --> 38:31.000
We came here from a solar system
on the verge of self-annihilation,

38:31.543 --> 38:35.838
where technology had created weapons
that threatened to destroy all life.

38:37.674 --> 38:40.176
A small group of us
set off to find a new home,

38:41.178 --> 38:44.679
a home that would be isolated
from the threats of other worlds.

38:46.891 --> 38:49.225
That was 309 years ago.

38:49.810 --> 38:52.062
And you haven't aged a day since then.

38:52.313 --> 38:54.522
Actually, I was a good deal older
when we arrived,

38:54.649 --> 38:56.399
in terms of my physical condition.

38:57.193 --> 38:59.444
There's an unusual
metaphasic radiation

38:59.528 --> 39:01.196
coming from the planet's rings.

39:01.405 --> 39:04.032
It continuously regenerates
our genetic structure.

39:04.909 --> 39:08.328
- You must've noticed the effects by now.
- We've just begun to.

39:11.707 --> 39:15.085
- I suppose you're 75.
- No, I'm 12.

39:16.253 --> 39:18.880
The metaphasic radiation
won't begin to affect him

39:19.006 --> 39:20.423
until he reaches maturity.

39:22.008 --> 39:25.386
To most off-landers, what you have here
is more valuable than

39:26.388 --> 39:28.055
gold-pressed latinum.

39:29.599 --> 39:31.141
I'm afraid that's the reason
that someone

39:31.226 --> 39:33.811
may be trying to take your world
away from you.

39:33.895 --> 39:35.854
The artificial life-form was right.

39:37.232 --> 39:42.403
If it were not for Data, it's probable
that you would be relocated by now.

39:43.029 --> 39:44.571
How can we possibly defend ourselves?

39:44.698 --> 39:47.616
The moment we pick up a weapon,
we become one of them.

39:48.076 --> 39:51.412
- We lose everything we are.
- It may not come to that.

39:52.872 --> 39:56.250
Clearly, the architects of this conspiracy
want to keep it a secret,

39:56.376 --> 39:59.545
not only from you,
but from my people, as well.

40:04.425 --> 40:06.134
I don't intend to let them.

40:11.849 --> 40:15.101
We've always known that to survive,
we had to remain apart.

40:15.936 --> 40:17.228
It hasn't been easy.

40:18.772 --> 40:22.025
Many of the young people
want to know more about the offland.

40:23.193 --> 40:26.779
They're attracted to stories
of a faster pace of life.

40:28.115 --> 40:30.700
Most of my people
who live that fast a life

40:30.784 --> 40:33.119
would sell their souls to slow it down.

40:34.455 --> 40:35.747
But not you?

40:37.624 --> 40:39.207
There are days.

40:42.754 --> 40:45.964
You don't live up to your reputation
as an offlander, Picard.

40:46.090 --> 40:50.802
Well, in defense of offlanders,
there are many more people like me.

40:52.055 --> 40:55.140
Who wouldn't be tempted
by the promise of perpetual youth?

40:55.933 --> 40:57.434
I don't think so.

40:59.312 --> 41:01.813
You give me more credit than I deserve.

41:02.648 --> 41:05.067
Well, of course I'm tempted.
Who wouldn't be?

41:05.985 --> 41:09.571
But some of the darkest chapters
in the history of my world

41:09.655 --> 41:13.825
involve the forced relocation
of a small group of people

41:14.494 --> 41:17.495
to satisfy the demands of a large one.

41:19.664 --> 41:23.501
I'd hoped that we had learned
from our mistakes but

41:25.128 --> 41:27.004
it seems that some of us haven't.

41:35.597 --> 41:37.515
This is extraordinary craftsmanship.

41:38.809 --> 41:40.434
It's the work of students.

41:43.021 --> 41:45.272
They're almost ready
to become apprentices.

41:46.108 --> 41:47.191
In 30 or 40 years,

41:47.275 --> 41:50.027
some of them will take their place
among the artisans.

41:52.030 --> 41:53.864
Apprenticing for 30 years.

41:57.201 --> 42:00.120
Did your people's mental discipline
develop here?

42:01.705 --> 42:05.375
More questions. Always the explorer.

42:08.879 --> 42:12.215
- If you stay long enough, that'll change.
- Will it?

42:13.551 --> 42:16.052
You stop reviewing
what happened yesterday,

42:16.679 --> 42:18.513
stop planning for tomorrow.

42:21.392 --> 42:22.976
Let me ask you a question.

42:24.061 --> 42:27.522
Have you ever experienced
a perfect moment in time?

42:28.065 --> 42:29.315
A perfect moment?

42:29.733 --> 42:31.901
When time seemed to stop

42:31.986 --> 42:35.070
and you could almost
live in that moment?

42:39.409 --> 42:43.745
Seeing my home planet from space
for the first time.

42:44.873 --> 42:47.082
Yes, exactly.

42:48.585 --> 42:51.003
Nothing more complicated
than perception.

42:54.924 --> 42:56.717
You explore the universe.

42:58.511 --> 43:01.388
We've discovered
that a single moment in time

43:01.681 --> 43:03.348
can be a universe in itself,

43:05.101 --> 43:07.102
full of powerful forces.

43:08.771 --> 43:12.608
Most people aren't aware enough
of the now to even notice.

43:14.359 --> 43:17.028
I wish I could spare
a few centuries to learn.

43:18.947 --> 43:22.950
It took us centuries to learn that
it doesn't have to take centuries to learn.

43:24.870 --> 43:26.871
There's one thing I don't understand.

43:27.956 --> 43:31.125
In 300 years,
you never learned to swim?

43:33.754 --> 43:35.796
I just haven't got around to it yet.

43:42.387 --> 43:46.390
I wonder if you're aware of the trust
you engender, Jean-Luc Picard.

43:47.809 --> 43:51.145
- In my experience, it's unusual for...
- For an offlander?

43:52.063 --> 43:53.939
For someone so young.

44:30.267 --> 44:33.227
- Geordi?
- Captain.

44:36.231 --> 44:38.607
As it turns out, there wasn't anything
wrong with my implants at all.

44:38.692 --> 44:41.652
There was something right
with my eyes.

44:46.992 --> 44:50.327
When Dr. Crusher removed
the ocular connection,

44:50.412 --> 44:53.289
she found that the cells
around my optic nerve had...

44:53.623 --> 44:55.582
Started to regenerate.

44:59.879 --> 45:04.675
It may not last, and if it doesn't, I just...

45:05.260 --> 45:07.219
I just wanted, before we go...

45:10.848 --> 45:12.849
You know, I've never seen a sunrise,

45:13.892 --> 45:16.644
at least, not the way you see them.

45:47.092 --> 45:48.258
Come.

45:52.096 --> 45:55.640
Am I to understand that
you're not releasing my men, Captain?

45:57.310 --> 45:58.852
We found the holoship.

46:00.980 --> 46:02.939
Ru'afo, why don't you
let the Captain and me...

46:03.024 --> 46:04.441
No!

46:13.242 --> 46:17.454
This entire mission has been
one Federation blunder after another.

46:20.249 --> 46:21.666
You will return my men

46:22.377 --> 46:25.670
or this alliance will end
with the destruction of your ship.

46:36.515 --> 46:39.225
You're looking well, Jean-Luc. Rested.

46:39.935 --> 46:44.063
I won't let you move them, Admiral.
I will take this to the Federation Council.

46:44.147 --> 46:46.690
I'm acting on orders
from the Federation Council.

46:47.526 --> 46:50.319
How can there be an order
to abandon the Prime Directive?

46:50.404 --> 46:52.238
The Prime Directive doesn't apply.

46:52.322 --> 46:54.573
These people are not indigenous
to this planet.

46:54.658 --> 46:56.867
They were never meant to be immortal.

46:57.285 --> 47:00.746
We'll simply be restoring them
to their natural evolution.

47:00.831 --> 47:01.914
Who the hell are we

47:01.998 --> 47:04.457
to determine the next course
of evolution for this people?

47:04.542 --> 47:07.794
Jean-Luc,
there are 600 people down there.

47:08.337 --> 47:10.547
We'll be able to use
the regenerative properties

47:10.631 --> 47:12.799
of this radiation to help billions.

47:14.552 --> 47:16.010
The Son'a have developed a procedure

47:16.095 --> 47:19.389
to collect the metaphasic particles
from the planet's rings.

47:19.473 --> 47:22.559
- A planet in Federation space.
- That's right.

47:23.018 --> 47:25.353
We have the planet.
They have the technology,

47:25.813 --> 47:28.690
a technology we can't duplicate.
You know what that makes us?

47:31.861 --> 47:33.027
Partners.

47:35.197 --> 47:39.617
Our partners are nothing more
than petty thugs.

47:39.702 --> 47:44.246
On Earth, petroleum once turned
petty thugs into world leaders.

47:44.372 --> 47:45.622
Warp drive transformed

47:45.707 --> 47:47.958
a bunch of Romulan thugs
into an empire.

47:48.042 --> 47:51.670
We can handle the Son'a.
I'm not worried about that.

47:51.880 --> 47:55.757
Someone probably said the same thing
about the Romulans a century ago.

47:55.842 --> 47:58.927
With metaphasics,
lifespans will be doubled.

47:59.179 --> 48:01.930
An entire new medical science
will evolve.

48:02.599 --> 48:05.017
I understand your chief engineer
has the use of his eyes

48:05.101 --> 48:06.852
for the first time in his life.

48:07.520 --> 48:09.354
Will you take that away from him?

48:10.273 --> 48:12.566
There are metaphasic particles
all over the Briar Patch.

48:12.650 --> 48:14.485
Why does it have to be this one planet?

48:14.569 --> 48:17.613
It's the concentration in the rings
that makes the whole damn thing work.

48:17.697 --> 48:18.947
Don't ask me to explain it.

48:19.032 --> 48:20.908
I only know they inject something
into the rings

48:20.992 --> 48:23.034
that starts a thermolytic reaction.

48:23.452 --> 48:26.787
When it's over, the planet
will be uninhabitable for generations.

48:26.872 --> 48:31.042
Admiral, delay the procedure.
Let my people look at the technology.

48:31.126 --> 48:36.672
Our best scientific minds already have.
We can't find any other way to do this.

48:37.007 --> 48:39.175
Then the Son'a can establish
a separate colony

48:39.259 --> 48:40.551
on the planet until we do.

48:40.636 --> 48:42.970
It would take 10 years
of normal exposure

48:43.055 --> 48:45.139
to begin to reverse their condition.

48:45.224 --> 48:47.183
Some of them won't survive that long.

48:47.601 --> 48:51.020
Besides, they don't want to live
in the middle of the Briar Patch.

48:51.146 --> 48:54.690
- Who would?
- The Ba'ku.

49:00.947 --> 49:04.908
We are betraying the principles
upon which the Federation was founded.

49:06.327 --> 49:08.370
It's an attack upon its very soul.

49:17.755 --> 49:20.090
And it will destroy the Ba'ku,

49:23.761 --> 49:25.512
just as cultures have been destroyed

49:25.596 --> 49:29.266
in every other forced relocation
throughout history.

49:30.184 --> 49:34.896
Jean-Luc,
we're only moving 600 people.

49:36.691 --> 49:40.651
How many people does it take, Admiral,
before it becomes wrong?

49:42.279 --> 49:47.032
A thousand? Fifty thousand? A million?

49:47.826 --> 49:50.703
How many people does it take, Admiral?

49:50.787 --> 49:52.997
I'm ordering you to the Goren system.

49:53.331 --> 49:56.750
I'm also ordering the release
of the Son'a officers.

49:56.918 --> 49:59.587
File whatever protests
you wish to, Captain.

50:04.342 --> 50:07.428
By the time you do, this will all be done.

50:59.103 --> 51:00.437
Gallatin.

51:01.230 --> 51:05.859
So, the righteous Starfleet captain
finally released you.

51:06.277 --> 51:07.402
Yes.

51:07.695 --> 51:10.238
Did you encounter any problems
on the surface?

51:10.573 --> 51:11.615
No, sir.

51:13.785 --> 51:15.702
But it wasn't easy being among them.

51:16.120 --> 51:20.207
I'm sure.
Just don't forget what they did to us.

51:24.170 --> 51:26.463
We'll have them rounded up
in a day or two.

51:27.215 --> 51:30.384
We needn't bother
with a Federation holoship anymore.

51:30.677 --> 51:33.261
- Just get the holding cells ready.
- Yes, sir.

51:35.681 --> 51:37.807
I'm going to miss
these little flesh-stretching sessions

51:37.891 --> 51:39.392
of ours, my dear.

52:03.834 --> 52:07.336
Re-routing the transport grid
to avoid detection was wise, sir.

52:07.546 --> 52:11.173
However, the transporter is rarely used
after 0200 hours.

52:12.175 --> 52:14.426
Taking the Captain's yacht out
for a spin?

52:14.510 --> 52:16.970
Seven metric tons
of ultritium explosives,

52:17.054 --> 52:18.555
eight tetryon pulse launchers

52:18.639 --> 52:20.682
and 10 isomagnetic disintegrators.

52:20.766 --> 52:22.475
Looks like you're planning
on doing some hunting.

52:22.560 --> 52:24.602
Return to your quarters.

52:27.398 --> 52:31.025
- That's an order.
- No uniform, no orders.

52:31.110 --> 52:34.112
Captain, how could I look
at another sunrise

52:34.196 --> 52:36.156
knowing what my sight cost
these people?

52:36.240 --> 52:39.075
I feel obliged to point out
that the environmental anomalies

52:39.160 --> 52:42.704
may have stimulated certain
rebellious instincts common to youth,

52:42.830 --> 52:45.498
which could affect
everyone's judgment.

52:45.583 --> 52:46.791
Except mine, of course.

52:46.876 --> 52:49.836
Okay, Data,
what do you think we should do?

52:51.881 --> 52:56.091
Saddle up. Lock and load.

53:01.347 --> 53:04.308
They won't begin the procedure
while the planet is still inhabited,

53:04.392 --> 53:07.561
so our job
is to keep the planet inhabited.

53:07.687 --> 53:10.898
Will, Geordi, go back and put a face
on what's happening here.

53:11.024 --> 53:13.358
Make the Council see the Ba'ku.

53:13.860 --> 53:15.652
It's too easy to turn a blind eye

53:15.737 --> 53:18.781
to the suffering of a people
you don't know.

53:19.532 --> 53:24.286
- I'll be back before you know it.
- We'll hold out as long as we can.

53:46.892 --> 53:50.311
The injector performs perfectly
in every simulation.

53:50.646 --> 53:53.064
Sir, as the Enterprise left orbit,

53:53.148 --> 53:55.149
one of their support craft
went down to the surface.

53:55.234 --> 53:56.442
What?

53:56.568 --> 53:59.987
Appeared to be the Captain's yacht.
Five persons onboard.

54:00.072 --> 54:01.989
We're not waiting until morning.

54:02.074 --> 54:05.910
Take the shuttles
and get everyone off the surface tonight.

54:07.246 --> 54:08.579
Gallatin.

54:09.747 --> 54:14.584
If Picard or any of his people interfere,
eliminate them.

54:19.924 --> 54:24.094
We're leaving the village!
Take only what you need!

54:25.179 --> 54:28.682
Bring food!
We may not be back for days!

54:42.113 --> 54:44.406
It is a transport inhibitor.

54:44.490 --> 54:48.826
It will help prevent spaceships
from beaming anyone off the surface.

54:50.495 --> 54:52.580
These veins of kelbonite
running through the hills

54:52.664 --> 54:54.623
will interfere with their transporters,

54:54.708 --> 54:57.543
and when the terrain forces us
away from the deposits,

54:57.627 --> 55:00.713
then we'll use transport inhibitors
as a compensation.

55:00.797 --> 55:03.632
The mountains have the heaviest
concentration of kelbonite.

55:03.717 --> 55:06.343
Once there,
it'll make transport virtually impossible.

55:06.469 --> 55:07.720
There are caves in those mountains.

55:07.804 --> 55:10.681
Then we should be able to hold out
for a long time once we're there,

55:10.807 --> 55:13.934
but they're not gonna make it easy
for us to get there.

55:14.019 --> 55:15.394
Captain!

55:15.478 --> 55:18.147
We've activated the transport inhibitors
around the village.

55:18.231 --> 55:19.398
Good.

55:24.487 --> 55:26.030
Let's move these people out!

55:32.703 --> 55:34.746
Transporters are not functioning.

55:34.830 --> 55:37.123
They're blocking the beams
with some kind of inhibitors.

55:37.207 --> 55:39.876
We'll have to locate and destroy them.

55:50.346 --> 55:54.933
No, no. Son, you're carrying too much.
We have a long climb ahead of us.

56:06.319 --> 56:09.154
We've lost three transport inhibitors.
There's a gap in the field.

56:44.481 --> 56:45.648
Artim!

56:47.109 --> 56:48.359
Father!

56:59.955 --> 57:01.831
They're following the kelbonite deposits,

57:01.915 --> 57:04.291
using the interference
to block our transporters.

57:04.376 --> 57:07.503
- Recommendations?
- Take me down. Let me talk to Picard.

57:07.796 --> 57:09.046
Talk!

57:09.381 --> 57:11.882
We should send down an assault team
and take them by force.

57:11.967 --> 57:14.635
That is not an acceptable option.

57:14.720 --> 57:17.513
If people get hurt, all the support
we have in the Federation...

57:17.597 --> 57:19.181
Federation support,

57:19.266 --> 57:22.642
Federation procedures,
Federation rules.

57:23.519 --> 57:27.105
Look in the mirror, Admiral.
The Federation is old.

57:27.857 --> 57:29.524
In the past 24 months,

57:29.608 --> 57:32.152
they've been challenged
by every major power in the quadrant.

57:32.236 --> 57:35.155
The Borg,
the Cardassians, the Dominion,

57:35.239 --> 57:38.700
they all smell the scent of death
on the Federation.

57:39.076 --> 57:41.077
That's why you've embraced our offer,

57:41.162 --> 57:44.497
because it will give
your dear Federation new life.

57:45.041 --> 57:47.042
Well, how badly do you want it,
Admiral?

57:47.126 --> 57:50.253
Because there are hard choices
to be made now.

57:50.963 --> 57:52.922
If the Enterprise gets through with news

57:53.007 --> 57:55.550
about their brave Captain's
valiant struggle

57:55.634 --> 58:00.263
on behalf of the defenseless Ba'ku,
your Federation politicians will waver.

58:00.347 --> 58:04.391
Your Federation opinion polls
will open a public debate.

58:04.476 --> 58:09.396
Your Federation allies
will want their say. Need I go on?

58:09.814 --> 58:12.399
There's an alternative
to an all-out assault.

58:12.484 --> 58:15.277
Isolinear tags would allow
our transporters to lock onto them.

58:15.361 --> 58:16.695
We'd have to tag every one of them.

58:16.780 --> 58:19.323
That would take time,
and we don't have it.

58:19.407 --> 58:21.575
The Enterprise is only 19 hours

58:21.659 --> 58:23.869
from communications range
with the Federation.

58:23.953 --> 58:28.082
- I'll order Riker to turn around.
- Picard's first officer.

58:29.125 --> 58:31.543
You really believe he'll listen?

58:32.962 --> 58:35.881
My ships are capable
of intercepting the Enterprise

58:35.965 --> 58:38.050
before it reaches the perimeter.

58:38.134 --> 58:40.384
I could send them to...

58:41.345 --> 58:43.096
To escort it back.

58:44.890 --> 58:47.850
But Commander Riker
might not want to come.

58:52.731 --> 58:54.398
Send your ships.

59:17.881 --> 59:22.467
- Do you like being a machine?
- I aspire to be more than I am.

59:23.052 --> 59:27.013
I know why. So people like us
won't be afraid of you anymore.

59:28.349 --> 59:29.641
Perhaps.

59:31.435 --> 59:33.520
Don't you ever get tired?

59:34.438 --> 59:37.607
My power cells
continually recharge themselves.

59:41.487 --> 59:45.115
I can't imagine
what it's like to be a machine.

59:45.199 --> 59:46.449
Perhaps it would surprise you to know

59:46.534 --> 59:49.619
that I have often tried to imagine
what it is like to be a child.

59:49.704 --> 59:51.663
- Really?
- Really.

59:51.914 --> 59:54.749
For one thing, your legs are shorter
than everyone else's.

59:54.834 --> 59:57.793
But they are in a constant state
of growth.

59:57.878 --> 01:00:00.963
- Do you find it difficult to adapt?
- Adapt?

01:00:01.798 --> 01:00:03.924
A child's specifications
are never the same

01:00:04.009 --> 01:00:06.302
from one moment to the next.

01:00:06.386 --> 01:00:10.264
It is a wonder
you do not trip over your own feet.

01:00:10.348 --> 01:00:12.141
Sometimes I do.

01:00:12.434 --> 01:00:16.979
My legs are exactly 87.2 centimeters
in length.

01:00:17.522 --> 01:00:21.025
They were 87.2 centimeters
the day I was created.

01:00:21.109 --> 01:00:24.403
They will be 87.2 centimeters
the day I go off-line.

01:00:24.487 --> 01:00:28.490
My operation depends on specifications
that do not change.

01:00:28.950 --> 01:00:32.328
I will never know the experience
of growing up

01:00:32.412 --> 01:00:35.705
or tripping over my own feet.

01:00:35.789 --> 01:00:38.583
But you've never had adults
telling you what to do all the time

01:00:38.667 --> 01:00:42.337
or bedtimes
or having to eat food you don't like.

01:00:42.421 --> 01:00:44.839
I would gladly accept the requirement
of a bedtime

01:00:44.924 --> 01:00:48.509
in exchange for knowing
what it is like to be a child.

01:00:49.553 --> 01:00:53.765
- Do machines ever play?
- Yes. I play the violin,

01:00:53.849 --> 01:00:55.683
and my chess routines
are quite advanced.

01:00:55.768 --> 01:00:59.145
No, I mean,
haven't you ever just played for fun?

01:01:01.357 --> 01:01:04.484
Androids do not have fun.

01:01:04.860 --> 01:01:08.196
Look, if you wanna know
what it's like to be a child,

01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:10.406
you need to learn to play.

01:01:23.086 --> 01:01:24.378
Captain.

01:01:26.464 --> 01:01:28.257
Mr. Worf, you need a haircut.

01:01:28.341 --> 01:01:30.884
Accelerated hair growth
is often experienced by Klingons

01:01:30.969 --> 01:01:32.636
during jak'tahla.

01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:36.014
- Jak'tahla?
- Roughly translated, puberty,

01:01:36.099 --> 01:01:39.268
although for a Klingon,
that scarcely does it justice.

01:01:39.352 --> 01:01:42.813
Any severe mood swings,
unusual aggressive tendencies,

01:01:42.897 --> 01:01:45.816
- you let me know at once.
- Yes, sir.

01:01:46.776 --> 01:01:50.070
The Ba'ku need some rest, sir.
According to the geo-scan,

01:01:50.154 --> 01:01:53.114
this is the safest area
within the next few kilometers.

01:01:54.283 --> 01:01:55.324
Very well. We'll take an hour.

01:01:55.409 --> 01:01:56.867
- Have them break out some rations.
- Aye, sir.

01:02:00.539 --> 01:02:03.833
Right beyond that ridge
is where the caves begin.

01:02:03.917 --> 01:02:05.584
We can hide there for days.

01:02:05.669 --> 01:02:07.670
By now,
the Son'a will have scanned this area.

01:02:07.754 --> 01:02:10.339
They'll know that as well as we do.

01:02:15.178 --> 01:02:18.347
It's been 300 years
since I've seen a bald man.

01:02:23.228 --> 01:02:25.646
How is it that you never married?

01:02:26.064 --> 01:02:30.484
And don't tell me it's just because
you haven't got around to it yet.

01:02:31.111 --> 01:02:34.112
- What's the rush?
- I should warn you,

01:02:34.196 --> 01:02:37.115
I've always been attracted
to older women.

01:03:01.515 --> 01:03:05.435
- How are you doing this?
- No more questions.

01:03:20.950 --> 01:03:24.036
Commander, I'm showing
two Son'a ships on an intercept course.

01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:25.829
- How long till they reach us?
- Eighteen minutes.

01:03:25.914 --> 01:03:28.749
We won't be able to get a transmission
out of here for at least another hour.

01:03:28.833 --> 01:03:30.167
They're hailing us.

01:03:30.251 --> 01:03:32.086
Tell them our transceiver assembly
is down,

01:03:32.170 --> 01:03:35.381
that we can send messages
but not receive them.

01:03:35.590 --> 01:03:38.467
- I don't think they believe us.
- Why not?

01:03:40.428 --> 01:03:42.054
Photon torpedo.

01:03:42.138 --> 01:03:44.139
Isn't that the universal greeting
when communications are down?

01:03:44.224 --> 01:03:47.643
I think it's the universal greeting
when you don't like someone.

01:03:47.727 --> 01:03:49.018
Full impulse.

01:03:49.103 --> 01:03:51.896
Manifolds can't handle full impulse
in the Patch, Commander.

01:03:51.980 --> 01:03:55.650
If we don't outrun them, the manifolds'll
be the only thing left on the ship.

01:03:55.734 --> 01:03:59.862
- I'll be in Engineering.
- Red alert! All hands, battle stations!

01:04:00.906 --> 01:04:04.367
And have you noticed
how your boobs have started to firm up?

01:04:04.451 --> 01:04:08.079
Not that we care about such things
in this day and age.

01:04:08.872 --> 01:04:10.540
Thank you, Data.

01:04:19.842 --> 01:04:23.302
I've an odd craving
for the blood of a live Kolar beast.

01:04:23.846 --> 01:04:26.848
This environment
must be affecting me again.

01:04:27.515 --> 01:04:31.184
And have you noticed
how your boobs have started to firm up?

01:04:31.269 --> 01:04:33.395
Not that we care about...

01:04:34.188 --> 01:04:35.397
Take cover!

01:05:23.069 --> 01:05:25.488
Isolinear tags.
The transporters can lock onto them.

01:05:25.572 --> 01:05:27.114
We have to find shelter.

01:05:27.199 --> 01:05:28.699
There's a cavern
at the base of the next hill.

01:05:28.783 --> 01:05:30.117
This way!

01:06:03.150 --> 01:06:06.319
- Shields at 60%.
- Engineering to Bridge.

01:06:06.779 --> 01:06:08.863
We're burning deuterium down here.

01:06:08.948 --> 01:06:12.158
We're gonna blow ourselves up.
We won't need any help from the Son'a!

01:06:13.536 --> 01:06:15.119
What's inside that nebula cluster?

01:06:15.204 --> 01:06:18.540
Cometary debris,
pockets of unstable metreon gas.

01:06:18.624 --> 01:06:19.707
We don't want to go in there, sir.

01:06:19.792 --> 01:06:22.752
Yes, we do.
I'll take it from here, Ensign.

01:06:23.253 --> 01:06:26.713
Time to use the Briar Patch
the way Brer Rabbit did.

01:06:41.854 --> 01:06:46.149
Inside the caves, quickly! Everyone!
This way!

01:06:46.359 --> 01:06:47.568
Inside.

01:06:58.913 --> 01:07:00.747
Definitely feeling
aggressive tendencies, sir.

01:07:05.419 --> 01:07:09.547
They've detonated an isolytic burst.
A subspace tear is forming.

01:07:10.382 --> 01:07:11.716
On screen.

01:07:13.051 --> 01:07:16.887
I thought subspace weapons
were banned by the Khitomer Accord.

01:07:16.972 --> 01:07:18.431
Remind me to lodge a protest.

01:07:18.515 --> 01:07:21.642
Our warp core
is acting like a magnet to the tear.

01:07:22.686 --> 01:07:24.937
We're pulling it like a zipper
across space.

01:07:25.022 --> 01:07:26.272
Options?

01:07:27.190 --> 01:07:29.984
- We could eject the core.
- Will that stop the tear?

01:07:30.068 --> 01:07:31.360
You got me, Commander.

01:07:31.945 --> 01:07:33.362
That's your expert opinion?

01:07:33.655 --> 01:07:36.198
Detonating the warp core
might neutralize the cascade.

01:07:36.283 --> 01:07:38.034
Then again, it might not.

01:07:38.118 --> 01:07:41.161
Subspace weapons are unpredictable.
That's why they were banned.

01:07:41.954 --> 01:07:44.080
The tear is closing on us.

01:07:45.207 --> 01:07:48.710
- Impact in 15 seconds.
- Eject the core.

01:07:49.629 --> 01:07:50.712
I just did.

01:07:51.797 --> 01:07:54.049
Impact in 10 seconds.

01:07:57.011 --> 01:07:58.136
Detonate!

01:08:12.818 --> 01:08:14.361
Get me a medic over here!

01:08:25.287 --> 01:08:28.415
It worked, Commander.
The tear has been sealed.

01:08:28.667 --> 01:08:31.292
Yeah, but there's nothing to stop them
from doing it again,

01:08:31.377 --> 01:08:33.170
and we're fresh out of warp cores.

01:08:33.587 --> 01:08:36.006
We're still 36 minutes
from transmission range, sir.

01:08:36.508 --> 01:08:39.093
We're through running
from these bastards.

01:08:58.153 --> 01:09:00.529
Another 43 reported taken, sir.

01:09:12.209 --> 01:09:15.420
Captain, they're trying to drive us out
so their drones can tag us.

01:09:15.504 --> 01:09:17.630
With all the hydrothermal vents
in the substrata,

01:09:17.715 --> 01:09:20.633
the structural integrity of this cavern
is not going to hold for long.

01:09:20.718 --> 01:09:22.676
- Is there another way out of here?
- I don't know.

01:09:22.761 --> 01:09:25.763
Captain, tracking the water's course
may reveal another exit.

01:09:25.848 --> 01:09:27.765
Mr. Worf, come with us.

01:09:38.901 --> 01:09:42.738
I'm reading a nitrogen-oxygen flow
behind that calcite formation, Captain.

01:09:42.822 --> 01:09:46.158
Will this structure hold
if we were to blast through?

01:09:46.701 --> 01:09:48.827
I believe it is safe, sir.

01:09:50.705 --> 01:09:51.872
Fire.

01:10:10.767 --> 01:10:12.851
Get everybody into those caves,

01:10:13.603 --> 01:10:15.394
and set up force fields
once they're inside.

01:10:16.021 --> 01:10:17.021
Aye, sir.

01:10:23.445 --> 01:10:26.071
Geordi, are those pockets
of metreon gas?

01:10:26.656 --> 01:10:29.950
Yes, Commander. Highly volatile.
I'd recommend we keep our distance.

01:10:30.035 --> 01:10:33.537
Negative. I want to use the ramscoop
to collect as much of it as we can.

01:10:33.663 --> 01:10:34.705
The purpose being?

01:10:34.998 --> 01:10:36.415
The purpose being,

01:10:37.083 --> 01:10:40.169
I intend to shove it down
the Son'a's throat.

01:10:40.921 --> 01:10:43.214
Commander, if one of their weapons
hits that gas...

01:10:43.298 --> 01:10:45.466
It's our only way out of here,
Mr. Daniels.

01:10:45.759 --> 01:10:47.176
I wouldn't be surprised
if history remembers this

01:10:47.260 --> 01:10:48.344
as the Riker Maneuver.

01:10:48.512 --> 01:10:49.970
If it works.

01:10:53.433 --> 01:10:55.683
Computer,
access manual steering column.

01:10:58.020 --> 01:11:00.355
Transfer helm controls to manual.

01:11:00.439 --> 01:11:03.274
Bridge, storage cells are
at maximum capacity.

01:11:03.359 --> 01:11:05.860
They're powering
their forward weapons array, sir.

01:11:06.737 --> 01:11:09.906
Blow out the ramscoop.
Stand by. Full thrusters.

01:11:09.990 --> 01:11:11.783
Ramscoop released.

01:11:29.426 --> 01:11:30.718
Captain.

01:11:32.136 --> 01:11:34.596
Data, Troi, keep these people moving.

01:11:34.681 --> 01:11:36.265
Bring them out.

01:11:45.191 --> 01:11:48.318
I suspect it won't be long
before the drones get here.

01:11:49.612 --> 01:11:52.489
Keep moving! Keep moving!

01:11:53.908 --> 01:11:58.662
They found caves on higher ground.
We'll be safe there.

01:12:03.918 --> 01:12:08.922
Captain, take a look at this med-scan,
his DNA profile.

01:12:11.592 --> 01:12:15.428
- How can that be possible?
- Maybe we should ask them.

01:12:29.318 --> 01:12:31.694
Artim, what are you doing? Come.

01:12:40.996 --> 01:12:43.497
- Is this the last group?
- Yes, sir.

01:12:43.582 --> 01:12:46.667
Get them ready to move out.
We need to hurry.

01:12:46.752 --> 01:12:48.753
Anij went to find Artim.

01:13:14.278 --> 01:13:16.863
- Go with Tournel!
- No, I wanna stay with you!

01:13:16.948 --> 01:13:18.114
It is safer there. Go!

01:13:32.545 --> 01:13:33.754
Worf to Picard!

01:13:33.838 --> 01:13:36.799
Two life-signs,
one of them extremely faint.

01:13:36.883 --> 01:13:40.719
There are almost 4 metric tons of rock
blocking our way.

01:13:41.346 --> 01:13:44.056
No. That might cause another cave-in.

01:14:04.327 --> 01:14:05.494
Anij?

01:14:08.580 --> 01:14:09.747
Anij?

01:14:12.418 --> 01:14:16.421
- Worf to Picard.
- Yes? Yes, I can hear you.

01:14:16.755 --> 01:14:19.215
We are trying to get to you, sir.

01:14:21.427 --> 01:14:22.593
Anij.

01:14:30.227 --> 01:14:32.020
Help is on the way.

01:14:33.772 --> 01:14:38.026
- Worf, hurry. Anij is hurt.
- How bad is she, Captain?

01:14:41.572 --> 01:14:44.866
- I'm losing her.
- We're coming as fast as we can.

01:14:54.625 --> 01:14:58.378
Anij, stay with me.

01:15:02.967 --> 01:15:05.552
Help me find the power
to keep you in this moment.

01:15:06.971 --> 01:15:08.305
Stay with me.

01:15:09.307 --> 01:15:11.391
Don't let go of this moment.

01:15:29.743 --> 01:15:30.993
She's stabilizing.

01:15:31.411 --> 01:15:34.914
- Is it safe to move her?
- Safer than leaving her here.

01:15:40.837 --> 01:15:43.339
And you thought
it would take centuries to learn.

01:17:17.432 --> 01:17:21.350
Order them to surrender and
I promise you won't be court-martialed.

01:17:21.518 --> 01:17:25.104
If a court-martial is the only way
to let the people of the Federation know

01:17:25.189 --> 01:17:27.523
what is happening here, I welcome it.

01:17:27.900 --> 01:17:30.693
The Enterprise has destroyed
one of my ships!

01:17:30.944 --> 01:17:32.778
The other is on fire,
requesting assistance.

01:17:32.863 --> 01:17:35.281
The Enterprise would only fire
to defend itself.

01:17:35.699 --> 01:17:37.116
Ru'afo must have ordered the attack.

01:17:37.242 --> 01:17:39.202
I can't believe
he would have given that order

01:17:39.286 --> 01:17:41.037
without your consent, Admiral.

01:17:42.748 --> 01:17:45.791
I wonder which of us will be facing
that court-martial.

01:17:47.961 --> 01:17:50.796
There's nothing further
to be gained from this.

01:17:50.964 --> 01:17:54.467
You're right. This is going to end now.

01:17:54.551 --> 01:17:56.802
The Ba'ku want to stay on the planet.
Let them.

01:17:56.970 --> 01:17:59.721
- I'm going to launch the injector.
- You're not going to launch anything...

01:17:59.805 --> 01:18:02.390
In six hours,
every living thing in this system

01:18:02.475 --> 01:18:04.392
will be dead or dying.

01:18:04.810 --> 01:18:07.103
You would kill your own people, Ru'afo?

01:18:08.439 --> 01:18:11.399
Your own parents, brothers, sisters?

01:18:13.986 --> 01:18:15.612
Didn't you know, Admiral?

01:18:16.405 --> 01:18:18.990
The Son'a and the Ba'ku
are the same race.

01:18:22.662 --> 01:18:24.287
Picard just told us.

01:18:25.915 --> 01:18:27.832
Our DNA is identical.

01:18:31.087 --> 01:18:35.674
Which one were you? Gal'na? Ro'tin?

01:18:35.841 --> 01:18:39.176
Those names,
those children are gone forever.

01:18:39.302 --> 01:18:41.011
What's he talking about?

01:18:41.137 --> 01:18:43.180
A century ago,
a group of our young people

01:18:43.306 --> 01:18:45.641
wanted to follow
the ways of the offlanders.

01:18:46.518 --> 01:18:49.186
They tried to take over the colony,
and when they failed...

01:18:49.271 --> 01:18:52.189
When we failed,
you exiled us to die slowly.

01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:54.149
You're Ro'tin, aren't you?

01:18:55.944 --> 01:18:57.695
There's something in the voice.

01:19:00.782 --> 01:19:02.533
Would you be his friend, Gal'na?

01:19:04.202 --> 01:19:06.954
I helped your mother bathe you
when you were a child.

01:19:07.789 --> 01:19:09.206
She still speaks of you.

01:19:10.166 --> 01:19:14.044
You've brought the Federation
into the middle of a blood feud, Admiral.

01:19:14.838 --> 01:19:17.463
The children have returned
to expel their elders,

01:19:17.548 --> 01:19:19.716
just as they were once expelled,

01:19:19.883 --> 01:19:24.053
except that Ru'afo's need for revenge
has now escalated into parricide.

01:19:28.058 --> 01:19:30.560
It was for the Federation.

01:19:31.729 --> 01:19:34.063
It was all for the Federation.

01:19:48.037 --> 01:19:52.165
We're taking this ship out of here.
This mission is over.

01:19:52.583 --> 01:19:55.667
- It is not over.
- It is over!

01:20:02.091 --> 01:20:04.343
I do not take orders from you!

01:20:17.357 --> 01:20:21.443
If you launch the injector
while the planet's still populated,

01:20:21.569 --> 01:20:23.445
the Federation will pursue you until...

01:20:23.571 --> 01:20:29.618
The Federation will never know
what happened here.

01:20:57.312 --> 01:21:00.231
Admiral Dougherty
will not be joining us for dinner.

01:21:01.316 --> 01:21:02.983
Deploy the collector.

01:21:06.988 --> 01:21:10.741
- Do you have a problem with that order?
- May I talk to you alone?

01:21:12.159 --> 01:21:14.077
- Deploy the collector.
- Yes, sir.

01:21:19.583 --> 01:21:21.418
Moving them is one thing.
Killing them all...

01:21:21.502 --> 01:21:24.337
No one hated them
more than you, Gal'na.

01:21:25.464 --> 01:21:27.924
We've come a long way together.

01:21:28.008 --> 01:21:31.636
This is the moment we've planned
for so many years.

01:21:35.266 --> 01:21:39.269
Separate the Starfleet personnel
and secure them in the aft cargo hold.

01:21:39.353 --> 01:21:41.312
See that Picard joins them.

01:21:43.149 --> 01:21:44.190
The shields in that section

01:21:44.275 --> 01:21:46.860
won't protect them
against the thermolytic reaction.

01:21:48.195 --> 01:21:50.028
Thank you for reminding me.

01:22:36.742 --> 01:22:37.909
Jean-Luc.

01:22:47.753 --> 01:22:49.253
Come with me.

01:23:05.771 --> 01:23:08.355
It must have been strange for you
when you were a hostage,

01:23:09.065 --> 01:23:12.609
surrounded by all the friends
and family you knew all those years ago,

01:23:12.735 --> 01:23:15.946
each one looking exactly
as they did then.

01:23:17.031 --> 01:23:20.700
Like looking through the eyes
of childhood again.

01:23:22.870 --> 01:23:26.122
And here you are, closing those eyes,

01:23:27.375 --> 01:23:30.460
trying not to see what bitterness
has done to the Son'a,

01:23:30.545 --> 01:23:33.797
how it's turned Ru'afo into a madman.

01:23:33.881 --> 01:23:37.926
And you, turned you into a coward,

01:23:38.970 --> 01:23:41.304
a man who denies his own conscience.

01:23:43.641 --> 01:23:44.808
Get in.

01:23:51.314 --> 01:23:54.817
A coward without the moral courage
to prevent an atrocity.

01:23:56.152 --> 01:23:57.319
You offend me!

01:23:57.654 --> 01:24:00.322
Is this how a Federation officer
pleads for his life?

01:24:00.574 --> 01:24:02.491
I'm not pleading for my life.

01:24:06.663 --> 01:24:08.455
I'm pleading for yours.

01:24:09.583 --> 01:24:12.501
You can still go home, Gal'na.

01:24:23.346 --> 01:24:26.014
Computer, close turbolift doors.

01:24:30.352 --> 01:24:32.937
What you're asking me to do
is impossible.

01:24:33.022 --> 01:24:34.939
Do you know
how to disable the injector?

01:24:35.024 --> 01:24:36.816
I would need to be on the Bridge.

01:24:37.109 --> 01:24:39.611
The crew is loyal to Ru'afo.
An assault would fail.

01:24:39.695 --> 01:24:41.529
Perhaps we can lure him away.

01:24:41.780 --> 01:24:42.947
It doesn't matter where he is.

01:24:43.032 --> 01:24:45.116
As soon as he realizes
something's happening,

01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:47.452
he'll override my commands
with one word to his comm link.

01:24:47.536 --> 01:24:50.204
If he doesn't realize
something's happening...

01:24:53.042 --> 01:24:54.626
Can you get me to a transmitter?

01:24:54.710 --> 01:24:57.295
I need to speak with Data and Worf
down on the planet.

01:24:57.379 --> 01:24:58.671
We'll need their help.

01:25:01.216 --> 01:25:02.383
Deck 12.

01:25:03.010 --> 01:25:04.718
Initiate separation protocols.

01:25:05.053 --> 01:25:06.720
Activating injector assembly.

01:25:07.347 --> 01:25:08.847
Separation in three minutes.

01:25:11.893 --> 01:25:13.727
A small craft is coming up
from the surface.

01:25:13.853 --> 01:25:15.479
It's powering up its weapons.

01:25:16.022 --> 01:25:19.524
- On screen.
- One person aboard. It's the android.

01:25:21.402 --> 01:25:22.569
He's no threat.

01:25:27.575 --> 01:25:29.910
- Data to Picard.
- Go ahead, Data.

01:25:29.994 --> 01:25:31.411
Captain, they're ignoring my attack.

01:25:31.996 --> 01:25:34.706
Keep firing tachyon bursts
into the shield grid.

01:25:34.832 --> 01:25:36.333
- Is Worf in position?
- Yes, sir.

01:25:36.417 --> 01:25:38.585
He is ready for simultaneous transport.

01:25:38.711 --> 01:25:40.754
We're approaching the Bridge.
Picard out.

01:25:45.676 --> 01:25:46.842
Separation in one minute.

01:25:46.927 --> 01:25:49.845
Sir, the Federation ship
is creating a disruption in our shield.

01:25:49.930 --> 01:25:51.013
If they go out of phase,

01:25:51.098 --> 01:25:53.599
it'll increase our exposure
to the thermolytic reaction.

01:25:54.768 --> 01:25:58.562
Very well. Destroy that ship.
Reset our shield harmonics.

01:25:58.939 --> 01:26:00.773
Do not delay the countdown.

01:26:07.531 --> 01:26:11.117
Data to Picard.
They are rotating their shield harmonics.

01:26:12.202 --> 01:26:14.578
I am attempting
to return to the surface, sir.

01:26:15.247 --> 01:26:17.289
The Federation ship has been disabled.

01:26:18.125 --> 01:26:19.709
Separation in 20 seconds.

01:26:21.544 --> 01:26:23.586
- What is that?
- I don't know.

01:26:24.130 --> 01:26:27.465
- The systems don't seem affected.
- Separation in 10 seconds.

01:26:31.804 --> 01:26:32.929
Five seconds.

01:26:35.474 --> 01:26:37.475
Injector assembly has separated.

01:26:56.328 --> 01:26:59.163
Exactly as the simulations predicted.

01:27:05.128 --> 01:27:07.838
I'm not showing any change
in metaphasic flux levels.

01:27:08.256 --> 01:27:10.340
Your scanners must be malfunctioning.

01:27:11.176 --> 01:27:13.343
All ship functions are off-line.

01:27:15.305 --> 01:27:19.433
How can there be no ship functions
if the viewscreen is working?

01:27:19.517 --> 01:27:23.687
Artificial gravity is stable.
Life support is...

01:27:36.868 --> 01:27:38.284
A holodeck.

01:28:09.066 --> 01:28:13.069
We were transported to the holoship
when we reset our shields.

01:28:14.404 --> 01:28:16.863
Everything we saw was an illusion.

01:28:18.366 --> 01:28:20.158
Ru'afo, authorization Delta 2-1.

01:28:20.243 --> 01:28:23.537
Override all interlinked commands
to injector assembly one.

01:28:23.704 --> 01:28:25.330
Unable to comply.

01:28:25.414 --> 01:28:28.083
Injector assembly one
has been deactivated.

01:28:38.761 --> 01:28:42.222
All injector subsystems aboard
the collector are confirmed off-line.

01:28:43.099 --> 01:28:45.100
Decloak the holoship
and engage a tractor beam.

01:28:45.268 --> 01:28:46.393
Aye, sir.

01:28:55.443 --> 01:28:57.278
The crew knows something's happened.

01:28:59.531 --> 01:29:00.573
I've secured the Bridge.

01:29:03.910 --> 01:29:07.454
This ship is equipped
with 14 long-range transporters.

01:29:07.539 --> 01:29:09.039
Are they all useless?

01:29:09.124 --> 01:29:10.457
They must have been locked
and secured

01:29:10.584 --> 01:29:12.126
after we were beamed here.

01:29:13.211 --> 01:29:14.378
Isolate one

01:29:14.462 --> 01:29:17.214
and re-route its command sequence
through the auxiliary processor.

01:29:17.299 --> 01:29:20.926
Sir, there's nothing we can do.
They already have control of our ship.

01:29:22.304 --> 01:29:24.388
I don't plan on going back to our ship.

01:29:25.765 --> 01:29:29.768
- Mr. Worf, destroy that thing.
- Aye, sir.

01:29:32.397 --> 01:29:34.480
Weapons systems
have been taken off-line.

01:29:34.607 --> 01:29:36.608
The crew is re-routing Bridge controls.

01:29:39.945 --> 01:29:42.488
Captain, there is a problem
aboard the collector.

01:29:42.656 --> 01:29:44.741
The launch sequence has resumed.

01:29:44.992 --> 01:29:48.912
Collector shields have been raised.
Someone's onboard.

01:29:49.455 --> 01:29:50.747
It's Ru'afo.

01:29:50.831 --> 01:29:52.582
Can you override the launch sequence
from here?

01:29:52.666 --> 01:29:54.083
Not without his access codes.

01:29:54.168 --> 01:29:55.835
Is there a self-destruct?

01:29:55.961 --> 01:29:57.670
Yes, but without the codes,
it would have to be activated

01:29:57.796 --> 01:30:00.006
at the upper control matrix
on the collector.

01:30:00.090 --> 01:30:02.258
Mr. Worf, try and find some way
to beam through those shields.

01:30:02.343 --> 01:30:05.678
You'd have to detonate it manually.
There'd only be a two-second delay.

01:30:07.181 --> 01:30:09.182
We may be able to transport
between the shield generators

01:30:09.308 --> 01:30:11.267
if we are within 100 meters.

01:30:11.352 --> 01:30:12.684
Take us into position.

01:30:14.687 --> 01:30:18.440
Remain at your post, Commander.
I'll need you to beam me back.

01:30:18.524 --> 01:30:20.359
We're approaching the collector.

01:30:20.860 --> 01:30:24.029
One minute before separation,
you'll see the cryogenic tanks venting.

01:30:24.113 --> 01:30:26.198
Weapons fire could ignite the exhaust.

01:30:35.708 --> 01:30:38.502
Separation in 2 minutes
and 15 seconds.

01:30:48.888 --> 01:30:51.889
Intruder alert. Intruder alert.

01:31:26.508 --> 01:31:27.591
Captain!

01:31:29.261 --> 01:31:30.427
Worf?

01:31:37.601 --> 01:31:41.104
I'm picking up Captain Picard's
bio-signature onboard the collector.

01:31:42.106 --> 01:31:44.024
- Enterprise to Picard!
- Number One.

01:31:44.108 --> 01:31:46.276
We're approaching your position.
Do you need assistance?

01:31:48.446 --> 01:31:50.030
I may need a lift in a minute or so.

01:31:50.614 --> 01:31:51.781
We're on our way.

01:31:53.284 --> 01:31:55.285
Separation in one minute.

01:32:22.312 --> 01:32:24.646
- Report.
- It's Ru'afo's ship!

01:32:24.981 --> 01:32:26.106
On screen.

01:32:28.902 --> 01:32:32.988
Sensors are reading over
100 Ba'ku onboard and one Klingon.

01:32:33.656 --> 01:32:35.991
Target their ventral engines
and life support.

01:32:36.826 --> 01:32:38.327
Set a collision course.

01:32:41.664 --> 01:32:42.915
Stop!

01:32:47.169 --> 01:32:49.170
Ru'afo, we're getting too old for this.

01:32:49.296 --> 01:32:53.758
After today,
that won't be a problem for either of us.

01:32:53.842 --> 01:32:55.760
Separation in 30 seconds.

01:32:55.969 --> 01:32:58.513
You're really going to risk
igniting the exhaust?

01:33:00.599 --> 01:33:02.433
All right, I will!

01:33:13.028 --> 01:33:16.280
- Shields at 60%.
- Hold your course.

01:33:18.867 --> 01:33:21.828
- He wouldn't.
- Yes, he would.

01:33:24.373 --> 01:33:25.705
Now!

01:33:37.218 --> 01:33:39.719
Stand by, Captain.
We're right around the corner.

01:33:40.388 --> 01:33:43.181
Sorry, time's up.

01:34:22.888 --> 01:34:24.263
What kept you, Number One?

01:34:24.598 --> 01:34:26.265
The Federation Council
has asked me to inform you

01:34:26.391 --> 01:34:30.728
that the Ba'ku relocation will be halted
while they conduct a top-level review.

01:34:31.188 --> 01:34:33.439
Sir, Ru'afo's ship is hailing us.

01:34:34.065 --> 01:34:35.107
- On screen.
- On screen.

01:34:36.526 --> 01:34:39.862
Captain, the Son'a crew
would like to negotiate a cease-fire.

01:34:39.946 --> 01:34:41.530
It may have something to do
with the fact

01:34:41.615 --> 01:34:43.239
that we have three minutes of air left.

01:34:44.325 --> 01:34:46.784
We have plenty over here, Mr. Worf.
Prepare to beam aboard.

01:34:54.376 --> 01:34:56.961
You think when we get away
from this metaphasic radiation,

01:34:57.046 --> 01:34:58.546
it'll change the way we feel?

01:34:58.631 --> 01:35:00.215
Your feelings about her
have not changed

01:35:00.299 --> 01:35:01.799
since the day I met you, Commander.

01:35:01.884 --> 01:35:04.719
This place just let them out
for a little fresh air.

01:35:08.974 --> 01:35:11.309
I wish there were a way
to bring them back home.

01:35:11.393 --> 01:35:12.644
Ask them.

01:35:13.646 --> 01:35:16.814
I'm afraid there's too much bitterness
on both sides.

01:35:22.737 --> 01:35:23.987
Mother and son.

01:35:25.990 --> 01:35:27.157
You arranged this?

01:35:27.283 --> 01:35:29.660
I thought it might begin
the healing process.

01:35:41.005 --> 01:35:43.006
What am I going to do without you?

01:35:44.676 --> 01:35:46.426
I wish I could stay,

01:35:47.637 --> 01:35:51.682
but these are perilous times
for the Federation.

01:35:52.976 --> 01:35:55.269
I can't abandon it to people
who would threaten

01:35:55.478 --> 01:35:58.647
everything that I've spent
a lifetime defending.

01:35:59.649 --> 01:36:00.940
I have to go back,

01:36:01.525 --> 01:36:06.821
if only to slow things down
at the Federation Council.

01:36:09.658 --> 01:36:14.495
But I have 318 days
of shore leave coming and

01:36:18.041 --> 01:36:19.625
I intend to use them.

01:36:30.679 --> 01:36:31.846
Data?

01:36:32.514 --> 01:36:33.889
It's time to go.

01:36:35.559 --> 01:36:37.059
I have to go home now.

01:36:39.061 --> 01:36:41.229
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:36:55.578 --> 01:36:58.580
Mr. Data, I hope we'll see you again.

01:37:06.005 --> 01:37:12.010
Data! Don't forget.
You have to have a little fun every day.

01:37:13.262 --> 01:37:14.554
Good advice.

01:37:27.359 --> 01:37:29.693
Picard to Enterprise. Seven to beam up.

01:37:36.242 --> 01:37:37.409
Energize.

01:37:38.305 --> 01:37:44.755
