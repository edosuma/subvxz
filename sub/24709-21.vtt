14:03.801 --> 14:06.512
HAVE SOME DIFFICULT NEWS
FOR YOU, MRS. WIGGINS.

14:06.595 --> 14:08.514
I HAVE NO MONEY
FOR BAIL.

14:08.597 --> 14:12.351
YOUR HUSBAND WAS FOUND
SHOT THIS MORNING, MA'AM.

14:15.813 --> 14:17.690
DEAD?

14:19.733 --> 14:22.111
I'M SORRY. YES.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.199
MUTILATED?

14:28.826 --> 14:30.411
NO.

14:32.288 --> 14:34.957
SOME OF THE PEOPLE
WHO THREATENED HUGH'S LIFE

14:35.040 --> 14:37.001
THREATENED
TO MUTILATE HIM, TOO.

14:39.503 --> 14:41.338
WELL, OBVIOUSLY,
WE'D BE INTERESTED

14:41.380 --> 14:42.715
IN THE SPECIFICS
ON THOSE.

14:42.798 --> 14:44.800
CASTRATION...

14:44.884 --> 14:47.553
THROWING HIM
OFF BUILDINGS.

14:47.595 --> 14:50.055
SPECIFICS IN TERMS
OF HOW THE THREATS
CAME ABOUT.

14:50.139 --> 14:53.058
TO DO WITH HIS
BUSINESS DEALINGS.

14:54.268 --> 14:56.896
DIFFERENT
DISSATISFACTIONS--

14:56.937 --> 15:00.232
HIS, UH, HIS REALTY,

15:00.274 --> 15:03.235
COIN SALES,
AND SPORTS MEMORABILIA.

15:03.277 --> 15:06.030
ANYTHING SPECIFICALLY
INVOLVING HIS CAR SALES?

15:06.071 --> 15:10.284
OH, YES. MANY.

15:10.367 --> 15:12.494
WHAT WOULD
BE LIKE, UH...

15:12.578 --> 15:14.663
THE 3 MOST RECENT?

15:17.583 --> 15:19.752
WELL, YOU KNOW...

15:19.835 --> 15:22.254
ONCE THE SHOUTING STARTS,

15:22.296 --> 15:27.259
I, UH, ACTUALLY TRY
TO SCREEN OUT THE DETAILS.

15:30.137 --> 15:32.431
SOME ARE
IN FOREIGN LANGUAGES.

15:55.287 --> 15:56.705
WHAT THIS IS,

15:56.789 --> 15:58.040
CELINE AND THEM OTHERS IS
LOOKIN' TO MIDDLE ME OUT.

15:58.123 --> 16:00.209
OVER WHAT, MARVA?

16:00.292 --> 16:01.919
OVER KNOWIN' RICKY J'S
COMING OUT OF THE JOINT

16:01.961 --> 16:04.588
KICKIN' ASS AND TAKING
THEIR SORRY PIMPS' NAMES,

16:04.630 --> 16:06.340
BACK RUNNIN' THE STREETS

16:06.423 --> 16:07.508
WITH ME AS HIS BOTTOM HO.

16:07.591 --> 16:09.009
SO IT'S OFF ALL
THIS JEALOUSY,
MARVA,

16:09.093 --> 16:10.761
THE GIRLS TOLD US

16:10.803 --> 16:12.221
THAT YOU'RE INVOLVED
WITH A FREAK
NAMED CALVIN.

16:12.304 --> 16:14.306
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
I'M TELLIN' Y'ALL.

16:14.348 --> 16:15.683
THEY MAKIN' THAT UP
ABOUT ME AND CALVIN

16:15.766 --> 16:18.519
TO MIDDLE ME
OFF THE STREET.

16:18.602 --> 16:20.312
MARVA, HOW DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THE OTHER GIRLS
ARE TELLING US

16:20.354 --> 16:21.814
BEFORE WE EVEN SAY?

16:21.897 --> 16:24.149
WELL, WHAT THE HELL ELSE
YOU BROUGHT ME IN HERE FOR?

16:24.233 --> 16:25.693
YOU NEED TO BREATHE
DEEP HERE, MARVA,

16:25.776 --> 16:26.860
BEFORE YOU SCREW
YOURSELF--

16:26.944 --> 16:28.362
HELL IF I DO.

16:28.445 --> 16:30.906
YOU ALL NEED TO
STOP LISTENING
TO VICIOUS-MINDED HOS

16:30.990 --> 16:32.658
AFRAID MY PIMP'S GONNA
COME OUT KICKIN' ASS.

16:32.741 --> 16:34.159
BE QUIET, MARVA,

16:34.243 --> 16:35.661
AND TAKE A COUPLE
DEEP BREATHS.

16:41.125 --> 16:43.961
NOW, YOU HAVE HAD
TO DO WITH CALVIN,

16:44.003 --> 16:45.379
YOU DIDN'T
KILL THAT GIRL,

16:45.462 --> 16:48.716
AND YOU'LL LOUSE
YOURSELF UP
LYING TO US.

16:53.262 --> 16:55.472
WHAT I DID, <i>I </i>DID.
YOU UNDERSTAND?

16:55.514 --> 16:57.016
I DIDN'T DO NOTHIN'
ABOUT WHAT HE DID.

16:57.057 --> 16:58.142
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THAT IS.

16:58.183 --> 16:59.685
LET'S HEAR IT, MARVA.

17:02.312 --> 17:03.522
SELL HIM CONDOMS.

17:04.690 --> 17:05.691
WHAT?

17:07.026 --> 17:08.569
SOLD HIM CONDOMS.

17:12.281 --> 17:14.742
CALVIN HAD YOU
SELL HIM CONDOMS?

17:14.825 --> 17:16.410
ALL RIGHT?

17:16.493 --> 17:18.245
IF YOU DON'T EXPLAIN WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT,

17:18.328 --> 17:19.705
YOU'RE GETTING LOCKED UP.

17:19.788 --> 17:22.166
TAKE MY TRICKS' CONDOMS
AND TRADE HIM
FOR NICKEL ROCK.

17:22.207 --> 17:24.543
YOU'D SELL CALVIN
YOUR CUSTOMERS' CONDOMS

17:24.585 --> 17:26.628
<i>AFTER </i>THEY'D USED THEM?

17:27.963 --> 17:29.048
ALL RIGHT?

17:32.718 --> 17:34.553
WHY DID CALVIN TELL YOU
HE WANTED THEM?

17:34.636 --> 17:36.013
HE DIDN'T SAY NOTHIN',

17:36.055 --> 17:37.639
AND I DIDN'T WANNA KNOW
IF HE TRIED.

17:37.723 --> 17:39.141
Jill: YOU'RE LYING.

17:39.224 --> 17:40.684
WHAT DO YOU THINK
HE USED THEM FOR, THEN?

17:40.726 --> 17:43.062
US THINKING WHAT CALVIN
WANTED THE CONDOMS FOR

17:43.145 --> 17:44.563
DOESN'T
MOVE THE CASE, MARVA.

17:44.646 --> 17:46.231
YOU HAVE TO SAY IT.

17:46.315 --> 17:47.691
NOW QUIT
SCREWING AROUND.

17:50.319 --> 17:52.071
HE WANTED TO USE
THE SPUNK INSIDE

17:52.112 --> 17:53.322
TO PUT ON THE GIRLS
HE'D DO.

17:53.405 --> 17:56.241
HE WAS HUNG UP OFF OF
BEING IN TROUBLE BEFORE.

17:56.283 --> 17:59.620
HE'D BEEN CONVICTED BEFORE
OFF DNA EVIDENCE.

17:59.703 --> 18:02.414
THIS WAY, EVEN IF
A GIRL TESTIFIED,

18:02.456 --> 18:05.000
HE SAID THEY COULDN'T
CONVICT HIM BEHIND
THE DIFFERENT GENES.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.752
BUT THAT WAS
ALL HIM NOW.

18:06.794 --> 18:09.254
ALL I DID WAS
SELL HIM THE RUBBERS.

18:09.338 --> 18:12.424
WHERE WE GONNA LOOK
FOR CALVIN, MARVA?

18:15.844 --> 18:18.013
HE GOT A DELIVERY JOB.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.682
COME UP ON THE STREET
AROUND 4:00...

18:22.476 --> 18:24.895
I'LL SHOW YOU HIS PLACES.

18:34.863 --> 18:36.073
HEY, GREG.

18:37.324 --> 18:38.700
JAMES.

18:38.784 --> 18:41.537
SO JAMES JR.
SAILED RIGHT THROUGH
HIS FIRST CHECKUP.

18:42.704 --> 18:44.123
YEAH. THAT'S GOOD.

18:44.206 --> 18:45.582
YEAH. PEDIATRICIAN SAYS,
AT HIS STAGE,

18:45.624 --> 18:48.252
HE'S GOT EXCELLENT-
DEVELOPED REFLEXES.

18:48.293 --> 18:50.546
GOOD. GOOD FOR HIM.

18:50.629 --> 18:51.505
HEY.

18:51.588 --> 18:53.507
YOU SEEM A LITTLE
AGITATED, GREG.

18:54.716 --> 18:56.593
WE'RE LOOKING
AT SOME OVERTIME.

18:56.635 --> 18:58.053
AMEN. THAT'LL MAKE UP

18:58.137 --> 19:00.597
FOR THE LOST TIME
I JUST HAD TO TAKE.

19:00.639 --> 19:03.183
WE GOT A GUY TO LIKE

19:03.267 --> 19:04.893
ON THIS D.O.A.
HOMELESS WOMAN.

19:04.977 --> 19:06.395
THIS WHORE SAYS

19:06.478 --> 19:09.439
WE CAN START LOOKING
TO GRAB HIM UP
AROUND 4:00.

19:09.481 --> 19:12.025
WHAT IS IT, GREG?

19:12.109 --> 19:13.986
THIS GUY'S M.O.,
JAMES,

19:14.069 --> 19:16.655
IS FILTHY,
SICKENING,

19:16.738 --> 19:18.198
AND DISGUSTING.

19:18.282 --> 19:19.741
WHAT'S HIS M.O.?

19:19.825 --> 19:21.326
WHAT'S HIS M.O.?!

19:21.410 --> 19:23.829
DID YOU LEAVE
BEFORE WE FOUND

19:23.912 --> 19:26.915
THAT INORDINATE
AMOUNT OF SEMEN
ON THE D.O.A.?

19:26.999 --> 19:28.750
YEAH. I HAD TO TAKE OFF
FOR THE PEDIATRICIAN.

19:28.834 --> 19:32.171
WELL, HIS M.O. ACCOUNTS
FOR THAT INORDINATE
AMOUNT OF SEMEN.

19:32.212 --> 19:33.714
YOU FOLLOW ME?

19:35.591 --> 19:37.593
DO I GOTTA DOT THE Is
FOR YOU, JAMES?

19:41.597 --> 19:45.434
THE GUY BOUGHT
MULTIPLE USED CONDOMS

19:45.517 --> 19:48.061
OFF OF THIS PROSTITUTE
MARVA,

19:48.145 --> 19:49.479
MIXED THE CONTENTS
TOGETHER

19:49.521 --> 19:52.107
TO FORM
AN INORDINATE AMOUNT,

19:52.191 --> 19:54.359
AND THEN PUT IT
ON THE VICTIM.

19:54.401 --> 19:56.403
SO THAT'S HIS M.O.

19:56.486 --> 19:58.530
DON'T MAKE ME PAINT YOU
A PICTURE, JAMES.

20:02.492 --> 20:04.786
ANYWAYS...

20:04.870 --> 20:07.706
I'M GLAD TO HEAR
ABOUT THE CHECKUP.

20:07.789 --> 20:09.374
YEAH.

20:09.458 --> 20:11.710
SORRY I WAS A LITTLE SLOW
ON THE UPTAKE.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.429
I'M BUYING THIS.

20:22.512 --> 20:24.681
MY STANDARD
CONSULTATION FEE.

20:24.723 --> 20:26.725
SO, UH, IF MY CONCERN'S
HYPERSENSITIVE,

20:26.808 --> 20:28.393
YOU JUST TELL ME
TO SHUT UP.

20:28.477 --> 20:29.519
GO AHEAD.

20:29.561 --> 20:32.689
DR. GARRICK GIVES ME
MY BLOOD SCORES,

20:32.731 --> 20:34.900
SAYS HE'S PLEASED
WITH MY COURSE
POST-SURGERY

20:34.983 --> 20:37.611
AND WANTS TO RETEST
MY BLOOD IN A MONTH.

20:37.694 --> 20:40.155
I MAKE A LIVING
LISTENING TO ANSWERS.

20:40.239 --> 20:43.242
AND I DON'T KNOW
IS MY CONCERN
HYPERSENSITIVE,

20:43.325 --> 20:46.745
BUT HE DON'T SAY
THAT HE WAS PLEASED
WITH MY BLOOD SCORE.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.628
YOU STILL SHOW A .9
ON YOUR PSA, ANDY.

20:54.711 --> 20:56.088
LESS THAN ONE.

20:56.171 --> 20:57.464
LESS THAN ONE,
RIGHT.

20:57.547 --> 20:59.466
WELL, SO, DOWN FROM 6,

20:59.549 --> 21:01.093
THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD
DECREASE.

21:01.176 --> 21:03.303
IT IS, BUT WITH
YOUR PROSTATE
BEING REMOVED,

21:03.387 --> 21:05.430
WE'D LIKE IT
TO REGISTER 0.

21:05.514 --> 21:07.766
THE WORRY IS THERE
MIGHT STILL BE
CANCER CELLS

21:07.808 --> 21:09.226
IN THE BED
OF THE PROSTATE

21:09.268 --> 21:12.020
OR THOSE TYPE CELLS
MIGHT HAVE MIGRATED.

21:12.104 --> 21:13.689
SPREAD IN MY BODY?

21:17.442 --> 21:19.611
SO WHAT THE HELL DON'T
HE TELL ME THAT FOR?

21:19.653 --> 21:21.113
'CAUSE
IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE

21:21.154 --> 21:22.614
YOU COULD BE
A SLOW CLEAR, ANDY.

21:22.656 --> 21:25.450
YOUR LEVEL MAY NOT
HAVE GONE DOWN
AS FAR IT'S GOING TO.

21:25.492 --> 21:27.869
THAT'S WHY HE WANTS
TO RETEST IN 30 DAYS.

21:27.953 --> 21:29.371
HE TOLD YOU ALL THIS?

21:29.454 --> 21:31.248
IF YOU'D ASKED,
HE'D HAVE TOLD YOU.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.624
SOMETIMES YOU'RE
SUPPOSED TO LET
YOUR DOCTORS

21:32.666 --> 21:33.875
DO YOUR WORRYING
FOR YOU.

21:33.959 --> 21:36.461
ARE YOU WORRIED?

21:36.545 --> 21:38.463
I WISH
YOUR SCORE WAS 0.

21:38.547 --> 21:39.965
SO IN OTHER WORDS,

21:40.048 --> 21:41.508
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON, HUH?

21:41.591 --> 21:44.219
RIGHT NOW,
WE'RE NOT SURE
WHAT'S GOING ON.

21:46.471 --> 21:47.639
OK.

21:49.558 --> 21:52.102
THANKS FOR NOT
DOUBLE-TALKING ME.

21:52.144 --> 21:55.147
I UNDERSTAND
YOU WANT TO KNOW.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.400
I THOUGHT I MIGHT BE
OUT OF THE WOODS.

22:36.605 --> 22:38.315
YOU'RE ALWAYS,
OF COURSE, REMORSEFUL

22:38.398 --> 22:41.360
WHEN A CASE DON'T LOOK
LIKE IT'LL CLEAR.

22:41.443 --> 22:42.903
YOU DON'T
FIGURE OUR D.O.A.

22:42.986 --> 22:44.404
TO BE A BIG LOSS
TO HUMANITY?

22:44.488 --> 22:45.572
PLUS THIS HUMP,

22:45.655 --> 22:47.074
I BET HIS CLERGYMAN

22:47.157 --> 22:48.742
COULDN'T SAY
NOTHING NICE FOR.

22:51.703 --> 22:52.662
HOW'S IT GOING,
SHANNON?

22:52.704 --> 22:53.997
Shannon:
HOW'S IT GOING?

22:54.039 --> 22:55.332
Sipowicz:
WHO'S THIS?

22:55.374 --> 22:57.250
WE GET
A "MAN WITH A GUN" CALL.

22:57.334 --> 22:59.336
GROCERY OWNER SAYS
THIS ONE MOPED IN HIS STORE

22:59.419 --> 23:01.129
FOR, LIKE, 10 MINUTES.

23:01.171 --> 23:02.547
WHEN HE'S WALKING OUT,

23:02.631 --> 23:04.007
HE THINK HE SEES A PIECE
IN THE GUY'S WAISTBAND.

23:04.049 --> 23:07.052
OWNER TAKES A RIDE WITH US,
PICKS HIM OUT 2 BLOCKS DOWN.

23:07.135 --> 23:08.470
WHAT'S THIS ONE
DOING?

23:08.512 --> 23:10.680
NOTHING.
HE'S SITTING PARKED
NEXT TO A HYDRANT.

23:10.764 --> 23:12.224
LICENSE PLATES ARE
OFF SOME JUNKER,

23:12.307 --> 23:14.351
BUT THE V.I.N. NUMBERS COME
BACK TO THE STOLEN CAR

23:14.434 --> 23:15.852
FROM YOUR GUYS' HOMICIDE.

23:15.936 --> 23:17.354
THIS ONE'S LUCKY
HE DIDN'T GET
HIS HEAD BLOWN OFF.

23:17.437 --> 23:19.356
HE PULLED A GUN WHEN WE
WERE COMING UP TO HIM.

23:19.439 --> 23:20.440
HE LOOKING TO USE IT?

23:20.524 --> 23:21.817
NAH. HE'S A MOPE THIS GUY.

23:21.858 --> 23:23.360
SAID HE'S LOOKING
TO HAND IT TO US.

23:23.443 --> 23:25.487
A .25--ONE EXPENDED ROUND.

23:25.529 --> 23:26.780
HE SAY ANYTHING
ON THE WAY IN?

23:26.863 --> 23:28.156
THE OPPOSITE.

23:28.198 --> 23:29.533
DOES THAT MEAN "NO"?

23:29.574 --> 23:31.535
RIGHT.

23:31.618 --> 23:33.161
NAME'S ROSS CHESWICK.

23:33.203 --> 23:34.871
HE'S CLEAN WITH BCI.

23:34.913 --> 23:36.289
Bobby: NICE JOB.

23:36.373 --> 23:38.291
APPRECIATE IT.

23:40.919 --> 23:42.879
I'M DETECTIVE SIMONE.

23:42.963 --> 23:44.381
THIS IS DETECTIVE SIPOWICZ.

23:44.464 --> 23:45.715
ROSS CHESWICK.

23:45.757 --> 23:46.758
YEAH. HOW DO YOU DO?

23:46.842 --> 23:48.051
WE'RE GONNA NEED
TO TALK TO YOU

23:48.093 --> 23:50.011
DOWN THE HALL HERE,
ROSS.

23:50.053 --> 23:52.055
YEAH. I UNDERSTAND
YOU NEED TO.

23:53.056 --> 23:55.058
REFRESHING ATTITUDE.

24:03.650 --> 24:05.026
SO, UH, IT LOOKS LIKE

24:05.068 --> 24:07.821
YOU'RE IN A BIT OF
A JACKPOT HERE,
HUH, ROSS?

24:07.904 --> 24:09.322
YEAH.

24:09.406 --> 24:12.075
ANY IDEAS HOW YOU'RE
GONNA HELP YOURSELF?

24:12.159 --> 24:14.661
COMING CLEAN,
I GUESS.

24:14.744 --> 24:17.330
THERE'S THAT
REFRESHING ATTITUDE AGAIN.

24:17.414 --> 24:19.124
LET'S START
WITH THE GUN.

24:20.959 --> 24:23.044
THE GUN IS NOT MINE.

24:23.086 --> 24:24.671
HOW'D YOU COME
TO HAVE IT?

24:24.754 --> 24:26.798
AFTER AN ALTERCATION.

24:26.882 --> 24:28.508
Bobby: ROSS...

24:28.592 --> 24:30.343
THIS SOUNDS LESS LIKE
COMING CLEAN

24:30.427 --> 24:32.471
THAN TELLING IT
IN DRIBS AND DRABS.

24:32.554 --> 24:35.307
I'VE NEVER BEEN GUILTY
OF A CRIME BEFORE.

24:35.390 --> 24:37.434
OK. UH...

24:37.476 --> 24:39.936
WHO WAS
THE ALTERCATION WITH?

24:39.978 --> 24:41.897
MAN OWNED THE GUN.

24:41.938 --> 24:46.067
YOU HAVE TOLD US SO FAR
EXACTLY NOTHING, ROSS.

24:48.236 --> 24:50.405
GUN BELONGED TO
THE CAR SALESMAN HUGH

24:50.447 --> 24:51.907
WHO TOOK ME TO DRIVE
THE '94 NISSAN,

24:51.948 --> 24:54.201
WHICH I TOLD HIM
I MIGHT WANNA BUY.

24:54.284 --> 24:57.245
WHEN I WAS TAKING OUT
A LUCKY HE ASKED
TO BORROW,

24:57.287 --> 24:58.747
HUGH GLANCED OVER

24:58.788 --> 25:01.458
AND SAW
MY LICENSE PLATES
I BROUGHT IN MY KNAPSACK

25:01.500 --> 25:05.045
FROM MY '71 BUG
THAT WAS ON BLOCKS.

25:05.128 --> 25:06.838
HE AT THAT POINT
TOLD ME

25:06.922 --> 25:08.632
HE KNEW MY PLAN WAS
TO STEAL THE NISSAN,

25:08.673 --> 25:10.175
TAKE OFF
THE DEALER PLATES,

25:10.258 --> 25:13.011
AND PUT ON THE PLATES
FROM MY BUG,

25:13.094 --> 25:15.013
WHICH HIS ANALYSIS
WAS CORRECT.

25:15.096 --> 25:19.017
WE'RE TEST-DRIVING
UNDER THE FDR,

25:19.100 --> 25:21.728
AND HE, AT THIS POINT,
PULLED OUT HIS GUN

25:21.811 --> 25:23.855
AND TOLD ME TO PULL
IN THIS SIDE ALLEY.

25:23.939 --> 25:25.398
HE TOLD ME
TO GIVE HIM 200 BUCKS,

25:25.482 --> 25:27.150
DROP HIM AT THE OTB,

25:27.234 --> 25:28.652
AND HE'D GIVE ME
A 3-HOUR START

25:28.693 --> 25:31.071
BEFORE HE CALLED
THE CAR IN STOLEN.

25:31.154 --> 25:33.365
I ONLY HAD
26 BUCKS ON ME,

25:33.448 --> 25:35.158
WHICH HE SAYS
TO GIVE UP TO HIM.

25:35.200 --> 25:36.826
I REFUSE,
AND HE GUN-BUTTS ME.

25:36.910 --> 25:39.371
I'M HALF PASSED OUT
FROM THE BLOW

25:39.454 --> 25:40.539
AND GET OUT
TO TRY AND RUN,

25:40.622 --> 25:41.706
HE COMES OUT AFTER ME.

25:41.790 --> 25:43.833
WE GRAPPLE,
AND THE GUN GOES OFF.

25:43.875 --> 25:45.335
I HALF PASS OUT
FROM DEAFNESS--

25:45.418 --> 25:47.837
AND STILL BEING
HALF PASSED OUT
FROM THE GUN-BUTT--

25:47.921 --> 25:50.590
WHEN I FOCUS,
I SEE HE'S DEAD.

25:58.932 --> 26:00.183
OW.

26:05.522 --> 26:07.482
SO, OF COURSE,
AT THAT POINT,

26:07.524 --> 26:08.984
YOU'RE TOO SMART
TO CALL THE COPS.

26:12.404 --> 26:14.906
YOU KNOW WHERE
THE TOWN OF PRIMM IS?

26:14.990 --> 26:16.783
NO.

26:16.866 --> 26:21.246
IT'S A SMALL BUT GROWING
INEXPENSIVE COMMUNITY
IN NEVADA.

26:21.329 --> 26:24.207
YOU KNOW,
IN MY WARPED THINKING,

26:24.291 --> 26:29.004
I IMAGINED PICKING
MY EX-WIFE KATHY UP--

26:29.045 --> 26:30.880
YOU KNOW, "LET'S GO
TO PRIMM, NEVADA."

26:30.922 --> 26:33.174
BEFORE I WENT
TO SEE KATHY,

26:33.216 --> 26:35.218
I WAS GONNA
ROB A GROCERY STORE

26:35.302 --> 26:37.846
TO GET FOOD AND MONEY
FOR THE TRIP.

26:37.887 --> 26:41.266
I TRIED ALL DAY
TO GET THE NERVE UP,

26:41.349 --> 26:44.728
BUT, YOU KNOW,
I JUST...

26:44.811 --> 26:46.688
I COULDN'T DO IT.

26:46.730 --> 26:49.733
I MUST HAVE BEEN
TO 15 DIFFERENT
GROCERY STORES,

26:49.774 --> 26:51.318
YOU KNOW?

26:51.401 --> 26:52.902
ANY SPECIAL REASON

26:52.944 --> 26:55.405
YOU DECIDED TO WRAP
HUGH UP IN THAT TARP

26:55.447 --> 26:58.408
AND THEN DRIVE HIM OVER
TO THAT VACANT LOT?

26:58.450 --> 27:02.370
LIKE, 4 YEARS AGO,
I DUMPED STUFF THERE,

27:02.412 --> 27:03.872
AND 7 MONTHS LATER,

27:03.913 --> 27:06.666
I HAD THE OCCASION TO
DUMP SOMETHING ELSE...

27:08.293 --> 27:10.337
THE FIRST STUFF
WAS STILL THERE.

27:10.420 --> 27:13.131
STILL IN ITS
ORIGINAL HEFTY BAG.

27:17.677 --> 27:19.346
EXCUSE US.

27:19.429 --> 27:21.306
OH. SURE, GO AHEAD.

27:29.606 --> 27:31.691
HEY, COULD YOU SIT
WITH THIS GUY
FOR A SECOND?

27:31.775 --> 27:32.859
SURE.

27:32.942 --> 27:34.361
DON'T SIT TOO CLOSE,

27:34.444 --> 27:35.945
OR YOU'LL CATCH
BEING A MORON.

27:41.826 --> 27:44.329
YOU THINK HE'D
HAVE GONE THROUGH
ROBBING THAT CAR?

27:44.412 --> 27:45.664
NO.

27:45.747 --> 27:47.374
BUT I THINK ROSS THERE
WAS A VERY BUSY BOY

27:47.457 --> 27:48.875
AFTER HUGH
THE CAR SALESMAN

27:48.958 --> 27:50.293
GOT WHAT
WAS COMING TO HIM--

27:50.335 --> 27:51.795
OBSTRUCTING,
DESTROYING THE EVIDENCE.

27:51.836 --> 27:54.756
HE'S WALKING AROUND
WITH THE MURDER WEAPON
IN HIS TROUSERS

27:54.798 --> 27:56.007
LOOKING TO STICK UP
THE A &amp; P.

27:56.091 --> 27:57.384
HE'D HAVE NEVER
ROBBED THAT CAR,

27:57.467 --> 27:59.094
AND THAT HUMP SALESMAN
PROMPTS HIM INTO MURDER.

27:59.135 --> 28:01.805
ANDY, THIS IS A LOT
OF CLEANING UP TO DO.

28:01.846 --> 28:03.598
SYLVIA'S RIDING.

28:03.640 --> 28:04.808
SHE'S NOT GONNA LOOK
TO HURT THIS GUY.

28:04.891 --> 28:06.142
WHY DON'T WE JUST
WALK HER THROUGH IT?

28:06.226 --> 28:07.477
NO. I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THAT.

28:07.560 --> 28:09.521
THIS IS NOT EINSTEIN
IN THERE, ANDY.

28:09.604 --> 28:10.980
I WOULD HATE US HAVING
TO COUNT ON HIM

28:11.064 --> 28:12.857
KEEPING
SOME STORY STRAIGHT.

28:12.941 --> 28:14.818
I'M RELUCTANT TO CONSULT
SYLVIA RIGHT NOW.

28:14.901 --> 28:16.820
AND I'M RELUCTANT
THAT THIS ROSS

28:16.861 --> 28:18.071
GETS IN FRONT
OF THE GRAND JURY

28:18.154 --> 28:19.864
AND STARTS TELLING THEM
ABOUT PRIMM, NEVADA,

28:19.948 --> 28:21.324
AND THE 2
NICE DETECTIVES

28:21.408 --> 28:22.826
THAT TRIED TO HELP HIM
GET THERE,

28:22.909 --> 28:24.160
AND THEN WE WIND UP
GETTING LOCKED UP.

28:29.040 --> 28:32.001
YOU CARRY THE PRIMARY
CONVERSATIONAL LOAD
WITH HER.

28:37.424 --> 28:40.969
CAN'T KEEP HARMING PEOPLE
OFF A PREVIOUS MISTAKE.

28:41.010 --> 28:42.512
SIT DOWN, CALVIN.

28:42.554 --> 28:44.097
ALL I'M GONNA SAY,

28:44.180 --> 28:46.725
PICK ME UP FOR A SIMILAR
PREVIOUS CRIME

28:46.808 --> 28:48.518
AIN'T ENOUGH MOTIVE
NO MORE.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.520
LET'S NOT GET AHEAD
OF OURSELVES.

28:50.562 --> 28:52.605
YEAH. LET'S ESTABLISH
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

28:52.689 --> 28:55.066
OH, WE KNOW WHAT
WE TALKIN' ABOUT--

28:55.150 --> 28:59.028
ME BEING A SUSPECT
BEHIND PREVIOUS
RAPIN' BEHAVIOR

28:59.112 --> 29:00.989
FOR THE RAPIN' DEATH
OF THIS COOKIE.

29:01.030 --> 29:04.033
LOTS OF GUYS ON THE STREET
WITH RECORDS FOR RAPE
AND SEXUAL ASSAULT.

29:04.075 --> 29:05.660
WHY ASSUME
WE'RE LOOKING FOR YOU?

29:05.702 --> 29:08.121
I TOLD PEOPLE YOU'D
COME LOOKING FOR ME.

29:08.204 --> 29:10.915
I KNEW IT WOULD
COME TO THAT.

29:10.999 --> 29:12.083
HOW'D YOU KNOW?

29:12.167 --> 29:15.170
SOME PEOPLE GOT
A SIXTH SENSE.

29:15.211 --> 29:17.672
YOU KNOW MARVA?

29:17.714 --> 29:19.215
I KNOW SHE A HO,

29:19.257 --> 29:22.010
THINKIN' HER PIMP
COMIN' OUT NEXT MONTH

29:22.051 --> 29:23.720
GONNA CHANGE HER LIFE.

29:23.762 --> 29:27.098
DID YOU BUY USED RUBBERS
FROM MARVA, CALVIN?

29:27.182 --> 29:29.684
I DECLINE TO SAY.

29:29.726 --> 29:32.395
DID YOU TELL HER
YOU WERE GONNA PUT SEMEN
FROM OTHER JOHNS' CONDOMS

29:32.479 --> 29:34.230
ON WOMEN YOU WERE
HAVING SEX WITH?

29:34.272 --> 29:35.648
I DENY SAYING THAT.

29:35.732 --> 29:37.859
THAT'S
"HE SAID/SHE SAID,"

29:37.901 --> 29:40.028
LIKE THE PRESIDENT
AND HIS SEX.

29:40.069 --> 29:43.239
YOU GOT
SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE
TO PUT ON ME

29:43.281 --> 29:45.366
OVER KILLING THIS,
UH, COOKIE?

29:46.493 --> 29:48.912
ACTUALLY, CALVIN, YEAH.

29:48.995 --> 29:50.914
WE GOT ALL
THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE
WE NEED.

29:50.955 --> 29:52.749
OH, YOU BETTER HAVE
DNA PROOF,

29:52.832 --> 29:54.417
'CAUSE O.J. PROVED THAT.

29:54.501 --> 29:56.920
IF YOU'D JUST USED
A CLEAN CONDOM ON YOURSELF

29:57.003 --> 29:58.421
LIKE A NORMAL PERSON,
CALVIN,

29:58.463 --> 30:00.590
RIGHT NOW,
YOU'D BE IN THE CLEAR.

30:00.673 --> 30:02.091
BUT YOU BUYING
USED CONDOMS

30:02.175 --> 30:04.177
OFF A BUNCH
OF DIFFERENT TRICKS
FROM MARVA,

30:04.260 --> 30:07.180
SMEARING
THE COMBINED SEMEN
HOW YOU DID,

30:07.263 --> 30:09.933
<i>THAT </i>HAS DONE YOU IN.

30:10.016 --> 30:12.602
WE'VE BEEN ABLE
TO GO AHEAD

30:12.685 --> 30:14.103
AND TRACE DNA
SEMEN SAMPLES

30:14.187 --> 30:15.605
FROM ALL OF MARVA'S TRICKS.

30:15.688 --> 30:16.856
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT.

30:16.940 --> 30:18.483
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU'D
GET THEM TO COOPERATE.

30:18.566 --> 30:19.943
OH, ARE YOU KIDDIN'?

30:19.984 --> 30:21.653
BETWEEN PROVIDING
A SEMEN SAMPLE

30:21.736 --> 30:23.196
OR HAVING THE COPS
TELL YOUR WIFE

30:23.279 --> 30:25.114
YOU'VE BEEN PICKING UP
STREET WHORES, CALVIN,

30:25.198 --> 30:27.450
WHAT ARE THE JOHNS
GONNA PICK?
THEY ALL GAVE UP SAMPLES.

30:27.534 --> 30:31.955
WE HAVE MATCHED
MARVA'S CLIENT SAMPLES
WITH WHAT WAS FOUND ON COOKIE.

30:31.996 --> 30:35.083
SO HOW YOU
RULE ONE OF THEM OUT
FOR THE CULPRIT?

30:35.124 --> 30:37.126
THE FACT THE SAMPLES
ARE MIXED TOGETHER, CALVIN,

30:37.210 --> 30:40.755
RULES OUT ANY OF
THE INDIVIDUAL JOHNS
AS THE POSSIBLE PERPETRATOR.

30:40.797 --> 30:43.174
THAT'S WHERE YOU
LOUSED YOURSELF UP.

30:43.258 --> 30:46.636
YOU ALONE HAD ACCESS
TO THAT SEMEN COLLECTIVELY.

30:46.719 --> 30:48.304
WHAT ABOUT MARVA?

30:48.388 --> 30:50.306
MARVA DOESN'T MAKE SEMEN!

30:50.348 --> 30:52.100
SHE'D HAVE NO MOTIVE.

30:54.310 --> 30:56.229
LOOK, I...

30:56.312 --> 30:58.106
I GOTTA THINK.

30:59.148 --> 31:01.234
DON'T TAKE TOO LONG.

31:03.820 --> 31:05.738
LET'S GO. COME ON.
IN THE CAGE.

31:11.703 --> 31:13.246
[EXHALES]

31:14.956 --> 31:16.875
WHOA, GREG.

31:16.958 --> 31:19.294
I THOUGHT
I'D TAKE A SHOT.

31:19.335 --> 31:21.504
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD
STUFF, GREG.

31:21.588 --> 31:23.882
I THINK HE'S GONNA
GIVE IT UP.

31:23.965 --> 31:25.466
WELL, LET'S HOPE SO.

31:41.566 --> 31:45.778
ASSUME HIS ACCOUNT
ABOUT THE STRUGGLE
FOR THE GUN IS TRUTHFUL.

31:45.862 --> 31:47.864
YOUR GUY'S
TRYING TO STEAL THE CAR

31:47.906 --> 31:49.991
ORIGINALLY ARGUABLY
STILL MAKES HIM
RESPONSIBLE

31:50.074 --> 31:51.451
FOR FELONIES
WHICH FOLLOWED,

31:51.534 --> 31:53.369
INCLUDING
THE SALESMAN'S DEATH.

31:53.411 --> 31:55.747
THE CLOSEST HE COME
TO TRYING TO STEAL
THE CAR

31:55.788 --> 31:57.540
WAS HAVING LICENSE PLATES
IN HIS BACKPACK.

31:57.582 --> 31:59.417
WHICH YOUR GUY ADMITS
THAT THE SALESMAN
CORRECTLY INFERRED

31:59.500 --> 32:02.211
THAT HE HAD INTENDED
TO PUT ON THE CAR THAT
THEY WERE TEST DRIVING

32:02.253 --> 32:04.172
ONCE HE'D STOLEN IT.

32:05.965 --> 32:08.092
I'M JUST
TRYING TO TELL YOU

32:08.134 --> 32:09.844
HOW MY OFFICE
COULD LOOK AT
WHAT HAPPENED, ANDY,

32:09.928 --> 32:12.597
THAT THAT'S THE POINT
AT WHICH ALL HELL
BROKE LOOSE.

32:12.639 --> 32:15.224
SO YOU THINK
THEY MIGHT WANT
TO GO TO BAT?

32:17.393 --> 32:19.938
YOUR MOPE HASN'T WRITTEN
ANYTHING DOWN YET?

32:19.979 --> 32:21.439
MM-MMM.

32:23.149 --> 32:26.569
I THINK IF HE WERE
TO LEAVE OUT THE PART
ABOUT THE SALESMAN

32:26.611 --> 32:29.280
SEEING
THE LICENSE PLATES
IN HIS BACKPACK,

32:29.322 --> 32:31.908
HE MIGHT HAVE
A MUCH ROSIER FUTURE.

32:33.076 --> 32:34.911
PUTTING THE PLATES ON
WAS AN AFTERTHOUGHT

32:34.953 --> 32:37.789
ONCE HE WAS...
IN EMOTIONAL SHOCK.

32:37.872 --> 32:40.792
HE'S OUT ON
A SIMPLE TEST DRIVE,

32:40.833 --> 32:43.795
THIS CROOK SALESMAN
PULLS A GUN TO ROB HIM.

32:43.836 --> 32:46.089
THE SALESMAN'S
A DOCUMENTED LOWLIFE.

32:46.130 --> 32:48.925
THEN AFTERWARDS
THIS MOPE IS TERRIFIED

32:48.967 --> 32:51.177
OVER THINKING
THE REST OF HIS DAYS,
HE'S A CRIMINAL,

32:51.260 --> 32:52.637
BEGINS BEHAVING ERRATIC.

32:52.720 --> 32:55.890
HASN'T REALLY GOT IT IN HIM
TO DO ANY ACTUAL CRIMES.

33:06.150 --> 33:09.654
WHAT I LIKE,
IT'S ONLY THE ONE FACT
HE'S GOT TO DEAL WITH.

33:09.696 --> 33:11.656
AND HE'S LEAVING IT OUT.

33:14.575 --> 33:16.828
HERE YOU ALL COME AGAIN.

33:16.911 --> 33:19.622
YEAH, HERE WE COME.

33:23.835 --> 33:27.338
YOU GOT A CAGEY
POLICE MIND.

33:27.380 --> 33:30.800
YOU ALMOST HAD ME COPPIN'
TO A INNOCENT CRIME.

33:30.842 --> 33:34.262
BUT I GOT A QUESTION
FOR <i>YOU.</i>

33:34.345 --> 33:37.932
HOW YOU GONNA PROVE
I WAS THE CULPRIT
OVER COOKIE?

33:38.016 --> 33:40.351
YOU GOT A SHORT
MEMORY, CALVIN.

33:40.393 --> 33:43.062
REMEMBER, MARVA TOLD US
IT WAS YOU BOUGHT
THE USED CONDOMS.

33:43.146 --> 33:45.565
MARVA SAID
I BOUGHT THEM CONDOMS,

33:45.648 --> 33:47.775
BUT SHE DIDN'T TELL YOU
WHO I SOLD THEM TO

33:47.859 --> 33:50.445
AND NOT KNOW WHAT THEY DID
WITH 'EM AFTERWARD.

33:50.528 --> 33:54.032
SO WHO WAS IT
YOU RESOLD
THE CONDOMS TO?

33:54.073 --> 33:55.158
I CAN'T TELL,

33:55.199 --> 33:58.369
'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW
THE PERSON'S NAME.

33:58.453 --> 34:00.705
BUT IT WAS THEM
MUST'VE DONE IN COOKIE.

34:00.747 --> 34:02.707
YOU DIDN'T RESELL
THOSE CONDOMS, CALVIN.

34:02.790 --> 34:06.961
PROVE THAT
WITH NO BACKUP DNA
OUT MY BODY.

34:07.045 --> 34:09.714
WE DON'T NEED
NO DNA PROOF, CALVIN,

34:09.797 --> 34:11.382
'CAUSE WE GOT
AN EYEWITNESS!

34:11.424 --> 34:14.677
SEE, THAT WAS A BUSY
VACANT LOT LAST NIGHT.

34:14.719 --> 34:16.721
ANOTHER HOMICIDE VICTIM
WAS DUMPED THERE,

34:16.804 --> 34:19.015
AND IT'S YOUR BAD LUCK
THAT CULPRIT

34:19.057 --> 34:21.017
IS PREPARED
TO TESTIFY ON YOU

34:21.059 --> 34:22.894
TO LESSEN
HIS OWN PREDICAMENT.

34:22.977 --> 34:24.395
OH, YOU SAYIN'
SOMEONE'S DUMPIN' A BODY,

34:24.479 --> 34:26.856
AND I DON'T TAKE NO NOTICE
OF NONE OF WHAT HE'S DOIN',

34:26.898 --> 34:28.566
BUT <i>HE </i>SAW <i>ME?</i>

34:28.608 --> 34:31.027
HE DIDN'T SEE YOU
WHILE HE WAS
DUMPING THE BODY.

34:31.069 --> 34:32.570
HE CAME BACK
IN HIS CAR

34:32.653 --> 34:34.072
TO HAVE A WHAT'S WHAT
LOOK SUBSEQUENT,

34:34.155 --> 34:36.074
AND SAW YOU
FROM ACROSS THE STREET.

34:36.115 --> 34:37.575
YOU WEAR A HAT?

34:37.617 --> 34:39.285
HE SAYS I WAS
WEARIN' A HAT,
HE'S A LIAR,

34:39.368 --> 34:40.787
'CAUSE I NEVER WEAR A HAT,

34:40.870 --> 34:43.372
AND I CAN BRING 45 PEOPLE OUT
THAT'LL TELL THAT.

34:43.414 --> 34:45.249
HE SAID YOU WEREN'T
WEARING A HAT!

34:45.333 --> 34:47.418
AND WHAT HE DESCRIBED
ESPECIALLY

34:47.502 --> 34:48.586
WAS YOUR CORNROWS,

34:48.628 --> 34:50.421
YOUR DISTINCTIVE
HAIRSTYLE THERE.

34:50.463 --> 34:51.881
THESE AIN'T NO CORNROWS.

34:51.923 --> 34:54.884
THESE ARE TWISTS,
THE BEGINNING
OF DREADLOCKS LOCKIN'!

34:54.926 --> 34:56.385
IT'S NOT IMPORTANT
THAT HE DIDN'T KNOW
THE NAME

34:56.427 --> 34:57.595
OF YOUR HAIRSTYLE,
CALVIN.

34:57.678 --> 35:00.598
THE POINT IS,
HE DESCRIBED YOUR HAIR.

35:00.640 --> 35:02.350
HE PICKED YOU OUT!

35:08.940 --> 35:13.319
SHE LIVIN' IN
A DAMP CARDBOARD BOX.

35:13.402 --> 35:16.614
THAT'S 'CAUSE SHE WASN'T
A PROSTITUTE, CALVIN.

35:16.656 --> 35:19.492
TRY PUSHIN' ME OUT.

35:19.575 --> 35:22.120
THE MORE SHE PUSH,

35:22.203 --> 35:24.789
THE MORE
I START WANTIN' HER.

35:26.290 --> 35:29.168
THEN SHE HIT <i>ME.</i>

35:29.252 --> 35:32.296
I LOSE IT, START BEATIN',

35:32.380 --> 35:34.757
BUT SHE STRONG.

35:34.799 --> 35:36.759
SHE AIN'T CRY OUT

35:36.801 --> 35:40.263
'CAUSE SHE THOUGHT
SHE GONNA STOP ME

35:40.304 --> 35:41.973
STICKIN' IT IN.

35:42.056 --> 35:44.851
ONCE I MAKE UP THE MIND

35:44.934 --> 35:48.479
THAT'S HOW
IT'S GONNA BE...

35:48.563 --> 35:52.483
THAT'S HOW IT'S GONNA BE.

35:54.819 --> 35:58.281
SHE FOUGHT LIKE A HO.

YOU READY
TO WRITE THIS UP?

36:03.786 --> 36:06.205
HOW YOU GONNA FIGURE...

36:06.289 --> 36:09.083
2 CULPRITS IN ONE LOT

36:09.167 --> 36:10.793
THE SAME NIGHT?

MY WHOLE LIFE.

[SIGHS]

36:41.324 --> 36:43.743
I CAN'T HELP FEELING
I'M IMPRISONED.

36:43.826 --> 36:45.745
THAT WOULD BE
'CAUSE YOU ARE.

36:45.828 --> 36:48.206

TO INTERPRET IT

36:48.247 --> 36:49.707

IN CUSTODY,"

36:49.749 --> 36:52.084

THE LICENSE PLATES,

BUT TELLING THEM
EVERYTHING ELSE.

37:12.688 --> 37:15.733
JUST LEAVE OUT MY HAVING
THOSE LICENSE PLATES WITH ME

37:15.816 --> 37:18.736
FROM MY OLD VW BUG
TO PUT ON THE NISSAN
AFTER I STOLE IT.

37:18.778 --> 37:20.738
WHAT WOULD BE
A GOOD IDEA, ROSS--

37:20.821 --> 37:23.366
NOT EVEN THINKING ABOUT
THOSE LICENSE PLATES
NO MORE.

37:23.407 --> 37:25.284

ON SOMETHING FLAMMABLE?

THOSE WERE
2 GREAT INTERVIEWS.

I WAS PLEASED
WITH THE OUTCOME.

WITH SOME NEWS.

WANTING A FOLLOW-UP
ON MY BLOOD?

40:42.857 --> 40:45.276
THAT .9 SCORE
THAT I GOT.

40:47.361 --> 40:51.615
BUT IT HAD GONE
ALL THE WAY DOWN
FROM 6.

40:51.657 --> 40:54.118

A LACK OF ENTHUSIASM

40:54.160 --> 40:57.037
WITH THIS GARRICK'S
VOICE...

40:57.121 --> 41:00.040

I COULD PURSUE IT
WITH HIM

41:00.124 --> 41:01.542
WITH NO EVIDENCE,

41:01.625 --> 41:04.545
SO I WENT
AND I PURSUED IT
WITH MONDZAC,

41:04.628 --> 41:06.547

CORRECT.

HAVE MOVED
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

41:29.403 --> 41:32.323
OTHERWISE, MY SCORE
SHOULD BE LOWER.

UNLESS MY SCORE
DON'T LOWER
QUICK AS MOST.

41:46.837 --> 41:49.715

THAT MAY BE POSSIBLE?

41:53.260 --> 41:57.348

THE TEST AGAIN.

41:59.350 --> 42:02.561

THE POSITIVE VIEW.

USE HELP WITH.

DURING TODAY'S SCENE
YOU'D ASK.

42:41.392 --> 42:45.062
DID HE GIVE YOU
ANY PERCENTAGES

42:45.104 --> 42:47.898
HOW LIKELY
THE ALTERNATIVES ARE?

42:55.406 --> 42:59.159
THE GOOD ALTERNATIVES
ARE LIKELY ENOUGH

42:59.243 --> 43:02.037
THAT THEY GOT
A NAME FOR IT.

WHAT'S THE NAME?

43:12.256 --> 43:14.466
I'M A SLOW CLEARER.

43:19.930 --> 43:22.266
SHOULD WE GO WITH THAT?

43:25.436 --> 43:28.105

43:33.360 --> 43:36.530
LOOK HOW MUCH GOOD
COME SO FAR.
