COME ON UP,
IT'S OKAY.

06:57.801 --> 06:59.434
ANOTHER INMATE
BUSTED OUT WITH ME.

06:59.436 --> 07:00.368
DON'T WORRY,
HE'S A GOOD GUY.

07:00.370 --> 07:04.272
OH, HI, BOYS,
I'M CHARLIE,
CHARLIE MANSON!

07:07.711 --> 07:09.277
I CAN'T WAIT TO GET
OUT AMONG THE PIGS

07:09.279 --> 07:10.044
AND RAISE
SOME HELL.

07:10.046 --> 07:12.647
ALRIGHT, CHUCK, BUT WE
GOTTA LAY LOW FOR A WHILE.

07:12.649 --> 07:14.449
WHEN I STAND ON
THE MOUNTAIN AND SAY DO IT.

07:14.451 --> 07:15.383
IT GETS DONE.

07:15.385 --> 07:16.718
AND IF IT DON'T GET DONE,
THEN I'LL MOVE ON IT.

07:16.720 --> 07:19.621
AND THAT'S THE LAST THING
IN THE WORLD YOU WANT ME TO DO.

07:19.623 --> 07:22.724
ALRIGHT CHUCK,
JUST WATCH SOME
TV OR SOMETHING.

07:22.726 --> 07:24.792
Now back to...

07:24.794 --> 07:27.061
You can't just buy
people, Mr. Potter,

07:27.063 --> 07:28.563
You know what
you are?

07:28.565 --> 07:30.131
You're a
little bitch.

07:30.133 --> 07:31.733
That's right
you're a bitch,

07:31.735 --> 07:33.101
and I bet you'd
like to suck it,
wouldn't you?

07:33.103 --> 07:35.136
WAKE UP CARTMAN,
WE GOTTA GET TO THE MALL.

07:35.138 --> 07:35.637
WHAT?

07:35.639 --> 07:37.205
WE HAVE TO GO SEE
MR. HANKEY AT THE MALL.

07:37.207 --> 07:38.539
ALRIGHT, KEEP
YOUR PANTS ON.

07:38.541 --> 07:40.575
HEY, BRING US DOWN
SOME FOOD, ALRIGHT?

07:40.577 --> 07:42.710
OKAY.

07:42.712 --> 07:43.344
COME ON, "D".

07:43.346 --> 07:45.146
CAN SOMEBODY DRIVE
US TO THE MALL?

07:45.148 --> 07:46.214
( cheering )
YEAH!

07:46.216 --> 07:48.049
HELLO, MR. HANKEY IS
APPEARING AT THE MALL.

07:48.051 --> 07:50.585
CAN SOMEBODY
PLEASE TAKE US?

07:50.587 --> 07:51.819
UNCLE STINKY,
CAN YOU DRIVE US
TO THE MALL?

07:51.821 --> 07:53.821
NOT NOW, ERIC, HOLDING,
HE HELD HIM,

07:53.823 --> 07:54.555
WHERE'S THE FLAG?

07:54.557 --> 07:57.158
UNCLE STINKY,
MY STUPID FRIENDS WANNA
SEE MR. HANKEY.

07:57.160 --> 07:58.092
YOU HAVE TO TAKE US.

07:58.094 --> 07:59.494
I SAID NO
AND I MEAN NO.

07:59.496 --> 08:01.462
RESPECT
MY AUTHORITY.

08:01.464 --> 08:03.064
( grumbling )

08:03.066 --> 08:04.932
With only 16 seconds left,
the Cornhusker--

08:04.934 --> 08:07.301
We interrupt this broadcast
for a news bulletin.

08:07.303 --> 08:07.769
WHAT!

08:07.771 --> 08:10.071
Mass murderer and
extremely nasty person,

08:10.073 --> 08:12.674
Charles Manson, has
escaped from prison.

08:12.676 --> 08:14.475
Manson was the man
responsible for

08:14.477 --> 08:16.210
seven murders in
the late 60s.

08:16.212 --> 08:18.713
Manson has never shown
any signs of remorse

08:18.715 --> 08:19.280
for his crime.

08:19.282 --> 08:21.249
If you see Manson,
please kick his ass

08:21.251 --> 08:23.584
and smash his fucking
face in for me.

08:23.586 --> 08:24.786
And then call
the police.

08:24.788 --> 08:25.887
And now back
to the game.

08:25.889 --> 08:26.688
And they've done it!

08:26.690 --> 08:30.058
They've scored 16 unanswered
points in 15 seconds.

08:30.060 --> 08:30.825
OH, WEAK!
OH, WEAK!

08:30.827 --> 08:34.395
ERIC, I NEED YOU TO TAKE
CARE OF YOUR COUSIN ELVIN

08:34.397 --> 08:35.029
FOR A WHILE.

08:35.031 --> 08:37.298
I DON'T WANT TO
TAKE CARE OF COUSIN ELVIN.

08:37.300 --> 08:39.500
WON'T YOU DO IT
FOR GRANDMA?

08:39.502 --> 08:43.905
ALRIGHT, GIVE ME
TEN DOLLARS.

08:44.140 --> 08:45.106
KICK ASS.

08:45.108 --> 08:46.708
CHUCK, CAN YOU TURN
THAT DAMN THING DOWN?

08:46.710 --> 08:49.610
Hello, movie house!
Hello, burger parlor!

08:49.612 --> 08:51.713
YOU KNOW WHAT THE
SPIRIT OF CHRISTMAS IS?

08:51.715 --> 08:52.814
IT'S ANOTHER LIE.

08:52.816 --> 08:54.816
FROM THE LYING PIGS
THAT CONSIDER ME
THE WITNESS--

08:54.818 --> 08:57.819
OKAY, CHUCK,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

08:57.821 --> 08:59.153
MY FAMILY
SUCKS ASS.

08:59.155 --> 09:00.154
YEAH, THEY DO.

09:00.156 --> 09:01.089
ALL FAMILIES
SUCK ASS.

09:01.091 --> 09:02.857
HERE, WE GOT YOU SOME
STICKY CINNAMON BUNS.

09:02.859 --> 09:04.525
WOW, SWEET.
HEY!

09:04.527 --> 09:06.260
DUDE, WE HAVE TO
GET TO THE MALL.

09:06.262 --> 09:07.495
YOU GUYS, SERIOUSLY.

09:07.497 --> 09:08.196
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

09:08.198 --> 09:09.230
MY STUPID FRIENDS WANT
TO GO TO THE MALL

09:09.232 --> 09:11.132
TO VISIT MR. HANKEY
BUT NOBODY WOULD DRIVE US.

09:11.134 --> 09:12.133
OH, BUMMER.

09:12.135 --> 09:13.935
I'LL TAKE YOU.

09:13.937 --> 09:14.669
THAT'S OKAY CHUCK,

09:14.671 --> 09:16.604
YOU JUST KEEP WATCHING
CHRISTMAS SPECIALS.

09:16.606 --> 09:17.839
HEY, I DIDN'T
BUST OUT OF PRISON

09:17.841 --> 09:19.440
TO BE LOCKED UP IN
SOMEBODY'S BASEMENT.

09:19.442 --> 09:20.475
I WANT SOME ACTION.

09:20.477 --> 09:21.342
GOOD FOR YOU,
CHARLIE.

09:21.344 --> 09:23.111
COME ON, I'LL HOT WIRE
YOUR GRANDPA'S CAR.

09:23.113 --> 09:24.912
DO YOU REALLY THINK WE
SHOULD GO WITH THIS GUY?

09:24.914 --> 09:26.114
STAN, DON'T BE
SUCH A DUMB ASS.

09:26.116 --> 09:27.081
YOU HAVE TO
TRUST PEOPLE.

09:27.083 --> 09:30.284
ALRIGHT BOYS,
KEEP YOUR HEADS DOWN.

09:32.989 --> 09:34.021
( engine starts )

09:34.023 --> 09:35.423
WE'RE GOING
TO THE MALL.

09:35.425 --> 09:36.324
HOORAY!

09:36.326 --> 09:37.992
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
HE WOULD GO

09:37.994 --> 09:39.193
WITHOUT OUR
PERMISSION.

09:39.195 --> 09:40.161
NOW SHARON,
DON'T OVERREACT.

09:40.163 --> 09:42.029
MAYBE STAN DIDN'T GO TO
CARTMAN'S GRANDMOTHER'S.

09:42.031 --> 09:44.632
MAYBE HE JUST RAN AWAY OR
GOT KIDNAPPED OR SOMETHING.

09:44.634 --> 09:47.168
WHY, I HOPE FOR HIS
SAKE YOU'RE RIGHT.

09:47.170 --> 09:47.668
HELLO.

09:47.670 --> 09:49.971
HELLO, MISS CARTMAN,
IT'S SHARON, STAN'S MOTHER.

09:49.973 --> 09:52.540
DID STANLEY GO UP THERE
TO NEBRASKA WITH YOU?

09:52.542 --> 09:53.574
OH, WHY YES, HE DID.

09:53.576 --> 09:55.143
I THOUGHT YOU
WERE DEAD, SHARON.

09:55.145 --> 09:56.010
WHAT?

09:56.012 --> 09:57.845
STANLEY TOLD ME
YOU HAD PASSED ON.

09:57.847 --> 09:59.213
I'M GLAD TO SEE
THAT YOU'RE BETTER.

09:59.215 --> 10:01.883
GET THE CAR, RANDY,
WE'RE GOING TO NEBRASKA.

10:01.885 --> 10:05.219
OOOH, STAN'S
IN TROUBLE.

10:08.958 --> 10:09.624
DO YOU SEE HIM?

10:09.626 --> 10:11.492
NOT YET, I THINK WE STILL
HAVE A WAYS TO GO.

10:11.494 --> 10:12.493
I CAN'T WAIT
TO SEE HIM.

10:12.495 --> 10:13.361
HE'S GONNA BE
SO GLAD WE CAME.

10:13.363 --> 10:16.664
I DROVE ALL THE WAY
FROM MONTANA TO
SEE MR. HANKEY.

10:16.666 --> 10:17.365
THAT'S NICE KID.

10:17.367 --> 10:18.833
I KNEW MR. HANKEY
BEFORE HE WAS
EVEN FAMOUS.

10:18.835 --> 10:20.935
HOW THE HELL DID
MR. HANKEY GET
SO POPULAR?

10:20.937 --> 10:22.970
LOOK AT ALL THIS
MR. HANKEY STUFF.

10:22.972 --> 10:24.539
MR. HANKEY
KICKS ASS.

10:24.541 --> 10:25.206
AND ANOTHER THING,

10:25.208 --> 10:26.607
IT SAYS MR. HANKEY
IS ALSO APPEARING AT

10:26.609 --> 10:27.842
THE CROSSROADS MALL.

10:27.844 --> 10:28.509
SO?

10:28.511 --> 10:30.077
SO HOW COULD
MR. HANKEY BE HERE

10:30.079 --> 10:31.979
AND AT ANOTHER MALL
AT THE SAME TIME?

10:31.981 --> 10:33.381
DUDE, MR. HANKEY
HAS MAGIC POWERS.

10:33.383 --> 10:35.616
HE CAN DO
WHATEVER HE WANTS.

10:38.054 --> 10:39.287
HOW WOULD YOU
LIKE TO COME WITH ME

10:39.289 --> 10:41.589
TO A MORE SECLUDED
PART OF THE MALL?

10:41.591 --> 10:42.557
OKAY.

10:42.559 --> 10:43.324
I REALLY
LIKE THAT GUY.

10:43.326 --> 10:46.727
LOOKS LIKE YOU FINISHED
YOUR FUDGESICLE, ELVIN.

10:48.998 --> 10:49.864
( crying )

10:49.866 --> 10:54.769
GOD DAMMIT, BE QUIET,
SHUT UP, ELVIN!

10:58.208 --> 11:00.508
NO, ELVIN, BAD, ELVIN.

11:05.081 --> 11:08.316
FOLKS NEED
TO UNDERSTAND
THAT I AM TERROR.

11:08.318 --> 11:10.017
I AM FEAR, I AM...

11:10.019 --> 11:11.419
OH, HEY LOOK, ANOTHER
HOLIDAY SPECIAL.

11:11.421 --> 11:13.955
And now back to
"The Grinchy Poo"!

11:13.957 --> 11:16.390
The Grinchy Poo
went up the chimney

11:16.392 --> 11:17.758
and stuffed
the tree up.

11:17.760 --> 11:20.862
But then he heard a coo
like the cry of a dove.

11:20.864 --> 11:22.964
It was little
Cindy Lou Poo.

11:22.966 --> 11:24.599
Who was no more
than two.

11:24.601 --> 11:25.766
Mr. Hankey, why?

11:25.768 --> 11:28.336
Why are you taking
our Christmas tree?

11:28.338 --> 11:29.437
Why?

11:29.439 --> 11:30.972
That old Grinchy Poo
thought up a lie

11:30.974 --> 11:32.673
and he thought
it up quick.

11:32.675 --> 11:33.641
ALRIGHT BOYS,
YOU'RE NEXT.

11:33.643 --> 11:36.310
WELCOME TO MR. HANKEY'S
HAPPY LOLLY LAND.

11:36.312 --> 11:37.812
OH BOY, HERE WE GO.

11:37.814 --> 11:39.780
HOWDY-HO, BOYS.

11:39.782 --> 11:40.915
MR. HANKEY?

11:40.917 --> 11:43.818
GOSH, YOU BOYS
SMELL LIKE FLOWERS.

11:43.820 --> 11:45.519
YOU'RE NOT
THE REAL, MR. HANKEY.

11:45.521 --> 11:47.121
SURE I AM,
HOWDY-HO.

11:47.123 --> 11:49.090
YOU LOOK A LOT BIGGER THAN
THE LAST TIME WE SAW YOU.

11:49.092 --> 11:51.959
WELL, MR. HANKEY HAS
TO GROW TOO, YOU KNOW.

11:51.961 --> 11:52.526
HOWDY-HO.

11:52.528 --> 11:54.695
YOU BOYS WANT YOUR
PICTURE WITH MR. HANKEY?

11:54.697 --> 11:57.098
THIS IS NOT MR. HANKEY,
THIS IS A FAKE!

11:57.100 --> 11:58.199
( all gasp )

11:58.201 --> 11:59.100
( crying )

11:59.102 --> 12:01.269
IT'S OKAY KIDS,
I'M REAL.

12:01.271 --> 12:02.870
HOWDY-HO.

12:02.872 --> 12:04.338
HOWDY-HO!
HOWDY-HO!

12:04.340 --> 12:05.573
WHY ARE YOU PEOPLE
DOING THIS?

12:05.575 --> 12:07.275
WHY WOULD YOU
LIE LIKE THIS?
TO CHILDREN?

12:07.277 --> 12:09.377
LOOK KID, THERE'S
MR. HANKEY'S LIKE ME

12:09.379 --> 12:10.378
IN EVERY SHOPPING MALL.

12:10.380 --> 12:11.746
THERE IS NO REAL
MR. HANKEY.

12:11.748 --> 12:13.147
WHAT, WHAT
DID YOU SAY?

12:13.149 --> 12:14.248
OH BOY, YOU'VE
DONE IT NOW.

12:14.250 --> 12:17.285
BEHOLD, HERE'S
YOUR FALSE PROPHET.

12:17.287 --> 12:18.552
( all gasping )

12:18.554 --> 12:20.855
BOO!

12:20.857 --> 12:21.822
OW!

12:21.824 --> 12:23.024
GET HIM!

12:23.026 --> 12:24.592
SON OF A BITCH!

12:24.594 --> 12:25.459
YOU LIED TO ME,
MOTHER.

12:25.461 --> 12:27.461
YOU SAID IT WAS
THE REAL MR. HANKEY.

12:27.463 --> 12:28.596
WELL, YES, BUT...

12:28.598 --> 12:29.897
I WILL NOT FORGET
THIS, MOTHER.

12:29.899 --> 12:31.632
I WILL NOT FORGET
THIS EVER.

12:31.634 --> 12:33.935
THIS IS REVOLUTION!

12:34.537 --> 12:35.403
( screaming )

12:35.405 --> 12:37.605
UH-OH, THEY'RE
RIOTING AGAIN.

12:39.275 --> 12:41.442
All the poos down
in Poo-Ville

12:41.444 --> 12:43.277
joined hands
and they sang.

12:43.279 --> 12:45.079
They sang
all the same.

12:45.081 --> 12:47.381
And he, himself,
the Grinchy Poo,

12:47.383 --> 12:49.216
carved the roast poo.

12:49.218 --> 12:51.018
WOW, MAN,
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

12:51.020 --> 12:54.388
HE WAS EVIL
BUT NOW HE'S GOOD.

12:55.224 --> 12:56.190
( grunting )

12:56.192 --> 12:57.024
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

12:57.026 --> 12:57.892
SOME KID
MUST HAVE SAID

12:57.894 --> 13:01.529
IT WASN'T THE REAL
MR. HANKEY AGAIN.

13:03.900 --> 13:05.633
USE THE TEAR GAS!

13:05.635 --> 13:08.536
( coughing )

13:08.538 --> 13:10.104
I TOLD YOU GUYS
THE HOLIDAY SEASON

13:10.106 --> 13:11.739
IS NOTHING BUT
LIES AND BULLCRAP.

13:11.741 --> 13:12.506
WELL, HOW WAS IT?

13:12.508 --> 13:14.208
IT WAS A FAKE.
OH, I'M SORRY.

13:14.210 --> 13:14.909
CARTMAN WAS RIGHT,

13:14.911 --> 13:16.043
THE HOLIDAY SEASON
IS FOR IDIOTS.

13:16.045 --> 13:16.978
WHERE DID YOU
GO, UNCLE CHARLIE?

13:16.980 --> 13:19.947
I WENT TO A BEAUTY PARLOR
AND HAD MY TATTOO RE-DONE.

13:19.949 --> 13:20.648
LOOK.

13:20.650 --> 13:22.116
OH, THAT'S PRETTY COOL.

13:22.118 --> 13:23.351
HEY, WHERE'S KENNY?

13:23.353 --> 13:25.252
OH, HE'S AROUND.

13:25.254 --> 13:26.253
( mumbling )

13:26.255 --> 13:26.821
OH, HEY KENNY.

13:26.823 --> 13:29.156
COME ON, I'LL BUY
YOU KIDS AN ORANGE SMOOTHIE.

13:29.158 --> 13:32.960
( cop )
HEY, THERE HE IS!
THAT'S CHARLIE MANSON!

13:32.962 --> 13:35.629
RUN FOR YOUR
LIVES, BOYS!

13:36.399 --> 13:39.300
( breathless )
WAIT... YOU GUYS... SERIOUSLY.

13:39.902 --> 13:41.936
COME BACK HERE,
GOD DAMN IT!

13:42.138 --> 13:43.771
( tires screech )

13:43.773 --> 13:45.773
OH, GETTING AWAY!

13:45.775 --> 13:48.743
( sirens )

13:49.212 --> 13:50.678
KEEP YOUR HEADS
DOWN, KIDS.

13:50.680 --> 13:51.312
( gunshots )

13:51.314 --> 13:53.447
HEY, WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG
WITH YOU PEOPLE?!

13:53.449 --> 13:54.715
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THEY WOULD PUT

13:54.717 --> 13:56.050
A FAKE MR. HANKEY
IN THE MALL.

13:56.052 --> 13:57.451
IF MR. HANKEY
EVER FOUND OUT,

13:57.453 --> 13:58.319
HE'D BE SO PISSED.

13:58.321 --> 13:59.787
We interrupt
this program

13:59.789 --> 14:00.688
for a breaking
news story.

14:00.690 --> 14:03.357
A high speed car chase
is happening right now

14:03.359 --> 14:04.091
on Interstate-3.

14:04.093 --> 14:06.594
We go now to our
live Sky-5 helicopter.

14:06.596 --> 14:07.728
Ron, it looks as
though the chase

14:07.730 --> 14:09.463
is proceeding west,
down the Interstate.

14:09.465 --> 14:11.532
OH, THAT LOOKS A LOT
LIKE YOUR CAR, HAROLD.

14:11.534 --> 14:13.901
We understand that
Charles Manson is inside the car

14:13.903 --> 14:17.071
with several hostages,
all of whom are children.

14:17.073 --> 14:19.206
My God, what is this
world coming to?!

14:19.208 --> 14:20.408
Well, we'd like to take
a moment to tell you

14:20.410 --> 14:22.576
that this car chase is
being brought to you by

14:22.578 --> 14:23.511
Snacky S'mores.

14:23.513 --> 14:24.678
The creamy
fun of s'mores

14:24.680 --> 14:26.814
in a delightful
cookie crunch.

14:27.417 --> 14:30.351
THEY'RE GAINING ON US.

14:31.487 --> 14:32.486
FUDGESICLE!

14:32.488 --> 14:34.588
( tires screeching )

14:35.091 --> 14:35.890
KICK ASS.

14:35.892 --> 14:38.192
GOD, I HATE THE
HOLIDAY SEASON.

14:38.194 --> 14:43.664
( gunshots )

14:43.666 --> 14:45.966
OH, HELLO KIDS,
HAVING FUN?

14:45.968 --> 14:47.134
GET IN THE HOUSE.

14:47.136 --> 14:48.769
ALRIGHTY THEN.

14:48.771 --> 14:49.403
LOCK THE DOOR.

14:49.405 --> 14:52.039
OH, MY GOD
IT'S CHARLIE MANSON, WOW!

14:52.041 --> 14:52.606
WHAT'S GOING ON?

14:52.608 --> 14:54.275
THERE'S A BUNCH OF
POLICEMEN CHASING AFTER US.

14:54.277 --> 14:56.110
QUITE DOWN, WE'RE
WATCHING TELEVISION.

14:56.112 --> 14:58.045
Oh Phillip, what
a festive season.

14:58.047 --> 14:58.946
That's right,
Terrance.

14:58.948 --> 15:00.614
This is the season
for sharing.

15:00.616 --> 15:01.882
( farts )

15:01.884 --> 15:03.084
THE COPS
ARE HERE.

15:03.086 --> 15:03.818
HOWARD?

15:03.820 --> 15:05.753
HOW DID YOU
GET OUT, SON?

15:05.755 --> 15:07.788
ALRIGHT MANSON,
WE KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE.

15:07.790 --> 15:09.790
COME OUT PEACEFULLY
AND WE'LL SHOOT YOU.

15:09.792 --> 15:10.858
TELL HIM WE WON'T
SHOOT HIM.

15:10.860 --> 15:11.992
OH, YEAH,
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

15:11.994 --> 15:14.762
COME OUT PEACEFULLY
AND WE<i> WON'T</i> SHOOT YOU.

15:14.764 --> 15:19.033
OH, LOOK,
POLICE CHIEF STEVENS
GOT A NEW HAIR CUT.

15:19.035 --> 15:19.633
GET DOWN, MA!

15:19.635 --> 15:21.569
HEY MAN, DON'T POINT
A GUN AT YOUR OWN MOTHER.

15:21.571 --> 15:23.504
WHAT THE HELL IS
WRONG WITH YOU, MANSON?

15:23.506 --> 15:24.405
YOU'RE ACTING
ALL FUNNY.

15:24.407 --> 15:26.140
EVERYBODY JUST
SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP.

15:26.142 --> 15:27.808
WE'RE NOT GOING BACK
TO THE BIG HOUSE.

15:27.810 --> 15:29.844
WELL HOWARD,
YOU'VE DONE IT AGAIN.

15:29.846 --> 15:31.045
YOU RUINED
CHRISTMAS.

15:31.047 --> 15:32.646
THIS IS ROBERT POONER
REPORTING LIVE

15:32.648 --> 15:35.049
FROM NEBRASKA WHERE ESCAPED
CONVICT CHARLIE MANSON

15:35.051 --> 15:36.617
HAS WALLED HIMSELF
UP IN A HOUSE.

15:36.619 --> 15:38.119
WE UNDERSTAND
THERE ARE HOSTAGES

15:38.121 --> 15:39.987
AND THAT
THE SITUATION
IS CRITICAL.

15:39.989 --> 15:41.222
SO WE WOULD LIKE
TO REMIND YOU ALL

15:41.224 --> 15:42.256
THAT THIS LIVE
HOSTAGE CRISIS

15:42.258 --> 15:44.225
IS BEING BROUGHT
TO YOU BY PALMORAL SUN BLOCK.

15:44.227 --> 15:47.294
REMEMBER, IF IT ISN'T PALMORAL
YOUR GONNA GET CANCER.

15:47.296 --> 15:48.996
WHAT'S GOING
ON HERE?

15:48.998 --> 15:50.030
WE'VE GOT A CRITICAL
SITUATION, MA'AM.

15:50.032 --> 15:52.666
CHARLIE MANSON IS HOLDING
EVERYBODY INSIDE HOSTAGE.

15:52.668 --> 15:53.868
IS THIS THE
CARTMAN RESIDENCE?

15:53.870 --> 15:55.536
YES, MA'AM.
GIVE ME THAT!

15:55.538 --> 15:58.172
STANLEY,
THIS IS YOUR MOTHER!

15:58.174 --> 15:59.240
UH-OH.

15:59.242 --> 16:00.708
WHAT'S YOUR MOM
DOING HERE, DUDE?

16:00.710 --> 16:01.775
YOUNG MAN,
I HAVE HAD IT.

16:01.777 --> 16:04.211
YOU HAVE DISOBEYED ME
FOR THE LAST TIME.

16:04.213 --> 16:05.513
WOW, SHE'S
REALLY PISSED.

16:05.515 --> 16:06.981
I'M GLAD I'M NOT
YOU RIGHT NOW, KID.

16:06.983 --> 16:10.251
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY
FOR YOURSELF, STANLEY?

16:11.053 --> 16:11.919
( Stan )
SORRY.

16:11.921 --> 16:14.588
STILL MORE DEVELOPMENTS IN
THE MANSON HOSTAGE CRISIS.

16:14.590 --> 16:17.291
IT APPEARS NOW THAT
EIGHT-YEAR-OLD STAN MARSH

16:17.293 --> 16:18.759
IS IN BIG,
BIG, TROUBLE.

16:18.761 --> 16:20.694
HE APPARENTLY
DISOBEYED HIS PARENTS,

16:20.696 --> 16:21.962
LEFT HOME WITHOUT
TELLING THEM.

16:21.964 --> 16:25.399
AND, TOM, HIS MOTHER
IS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH HIM.

16:25.401 --> 16:26.934
DAMMIT, WHAT
ARE WE GONNA DO?

16:26.936 --> 16:29.503
SSH, WE'RE WATCHING
TELEVISION.

16:29.505 --> 16:31.105
( laughing )

16:31.107 --> 16:32.072
( farts )

16:32.074 --> 16:33.207
Wait!
Wait!

16:33.209 --> 16:34.308
( farts )

16:34.310 --> 16:35.442
( laughing )

16:35.444 --> 16:36.410
Hold on.

16:36.412 --> 16:37.778
( farts )

16:37.780 --> 16:39.079
Over here,
over here.

16:39.081 --> 16:40.414
( farts )

16:40.416 --> 16:41.782
Here comes one...

16:41.784 --> 16:43.250
( farts )

16:43.252 --> 16:44.151
Hold on,
wait, wait.

16:44.153 --> 16:45.819
COME OUT WITH
YOUR HANDS UP.

16:45.821 --> 16:46.320
DAMN IT DAD,

16:46.322 --> 16:48.088
WHY DIDN'T YOU PUT
A BACK DOOR ON THIS HOUSE?

16:48.090 --> 16:50.991
WELL, THERE'S THAT
OLD WINDOW IN THE BATHROOM.

16:50.993 --> 16:52.993
YOU COULD PROBABLY
SQUEEZE THROUGH THERE.

16:52.995 --> 16:53.561
THAT'S IT.

16:53.563 --> 16:55.162
WE'RE GOING OUT
THE BATHROOM WINDOW,

16:55.164 --> 16:55.896
COME ON, MANSON.

16:55.898 --> 16:57.631
BUT I GOTTA
SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

16:57.633 --> 16:58.265
COME ON, DAMMIT.

16:58.267 --> 16:59.600
WELL, IT WAS GOOD
SEEING YOU ALL.

16:59.602 --> 17:01.936
DON'T MOVE 'TIL WE'RE GONE
OR I'LL SHOOT YOU DEAD.

17:01.938 --> 17:02.636
HAPPY HOLIDAYS.

17:02.638 --> 17:04.538
HAPPY HOLIDAYS!
HAPPY HOLIDAYS!

17:07.176 --> 17:08.309
DUDE, THEY'RE
GONNA KILL ME.

17:08.311 --> 17:09.877
ALRIGHT MANSON,
THIS IS IT.

17:09.879 --> 17:11.378
WE'RE COMING
IN AFTER YOU.

17:11.380 --> 17:13.180
THERE'S GONNA BE
A LOT OF BLOODSHED,

17:13.182 --> 17:15.449
AND A LOT OF INNOCENT
PEOPLE ARE GONNA DIE.

17:15.451 --> 17:19.286
YOU'VE GOT UNTIL
100 MARSHMALLOW
TO COME OUT.

17:19.288 --> 17:21.121
ONE MARSHMALLOW.

17:21.123 --> 17:22.456
TWO MARSHMALLOW.

17:22.458 --> 17:23.991
THREE MARSHMALLOW.

17:23.993 --> 17:25.960
ALRIGHT,
IT'S OPEN,
LET'S GO.

17:25.962 --> 17:27.261
EXCUSE ME, I WANT
TO GO WITH YOU.

17:27.263 --> 17:28.429
PLEASE, I DON'T WANT
TO GO BACK WITH THEM.

17:28.431 --> 17:31.432
BUT STAN, YOUR MOTHER
AND FATHER ARE OUT THERE.

17:31.434 --> 17:32.833
I KNOW, THEY'VE
COME TO PUNISH ME.

17:32.835 --> 17:34.201
ALL THEY WANT TO DO
IS MAKE ME PAY

17:34.203 --> 17:35.736
FOR COMING TO NEBRASKA
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

17:35.738 --> 17:37.304
ALRIGHT KID,
YOU CAN COME.

17:37.306 --> 17:38.305
NOW, LET'S GO.

17:38.307 --> 17:40.474
STAN, I WANT TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT FAMILY.

17:40.476 --> 17:41.242
WHAT?
WHAT?

17:41.244 --> 17:43.010
YOU SEE,
I HAD A FAMILY ONCE,

17:43.012 --> 17:45.112
AT LEAST I CALLED
THEM MY FAMILY.

17:45.114 --> 17:47.381
REALLY, THEY WERE NOTHING
BUT A GANG OF PEOPLE

17:47.383 --> 17:48.916
I THOUGHT
WERE MY FRIENDS.

17:48.918 --> 17:50.818
AFTER WE KILLED A BUNCH
OF PEOPLE TOGETHER,

17:50.820 --> 17:52.920
I REALIZED THAT
MY REAL FAMILY

17:52.922 --> 17:53.787
WAS WHO TOOK
CARE OF ME,

17:53.789 --> 17:56.156
AND WHO TOOK THE TIME
TO CARE ABOUT WHAT I DID.

17:56.158 --> 17:57.157
BUT THEY DON'T
CARE ABOUT ME,

17:57.159 --> 17:58.125
THEY JUST WANT
TO PUNISH ME.

17:58.127 --> 17:59.593
IF THEY DON'T
CARE ABOUT YOU,

17:59.595 --> 18:02.596
WOULD THEY HAVE DRIVEN
NINE HOURS TO NEBRASKA?

18:02.598 --> 18:06.400
I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT,
UNCLE CHARLIE, THANKS.

18:06.769 --> 18:08.235
NOW CAN WE GO?

18:08.237 --> 18:11.071
NO, HOWARD, YOU GO AHEAD,
I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO SAY.

18:11.073 --> 18:12.206
OH, WEAK!

18:12.208 --> 18:14.141
FOLKS, I APOLOGIZE
FOR THIS WHOLE MESS.

18:14.143 --> 18:15.476
I'M GOING
TO SURRENDER.

18:15.478 --> 18:17.011
SOMEBODY SHOW
THE POLICE A WHITE FLAG.

18:17.013 --> 18:20.748
90 MARSHMALLOW,
91 MARSHMALLOW...

18:20.750 --> 18:22.916
THIS MADE ME HUNGRY
FOR MARSHMALLOWS.

18:22.918 --> 18:25.519
92 MARSHMALLOW.

18:27.290 --> 18:29.256
LOOK OUT, HE'S GOT
A WHITE FLAG.

18:29.258 --> 18:31.692
( gunshots )

18:32.228 --> 18:32.793
OH, MY GOD!

18:32.795 --> 18:34.995
THEY KILLED THE LITTLE
ORANGE COAT KID.

18:34.997 --> 18:36.997
YOU BASTARDS!

18:39.669 --> 18:41.035
THEY'RE
SURRENDERING.

18:41.037 --> 18:43.604
YOU'RE UNDER
ARREST, BUDDY.

18:43.606 --> 18:45.906
ALRIGHT YOU,
SPREAD 'EM.

18:45.908 --> 18:48.642
YOU'RE GOING BACK
TO PRISON TO ROT, MANSON.

18:48.644 --> 18:49.843
GOOD, I DESERVE TO.
WHAT?

18:49.845 --> 18:53.013
I COULD NEVER MAKE IT UP TO
THE FAMILIES THAT I DESTROYED.

18:53.015 --> 18:54.114
BUT AT LEAST I'LL
MAKE AN EXAMPLE

18:54.116 --> 18:56.950
FOR ANYONE ELSE THINKING
THAT CRIME IS AN ANSWER.

18:56.952 --> 18:57.685
STOP THAT!

18:57.687 --> 18:59.320
YOU SEE,
I GET IT NOW.

18:59.322 --> 19:01.488
I FINALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT
THE HOLIDAYS ARE ALL ABOUT.

19:01.490 --> 19:02.356
BOYS, DON'T
YOU SEE?

19:02.358 --> 19:03.924
YOU CAN'T LET
THINGS GET YOU DOWN

19:03.926 --> 19:05.693
DURING THE HOLIDAYS,
BECAUSE BEING HAPPY

19:05.695 --> 19:07.928
IS WHAT THE HOLIDAYS
ARE ALL ABOUT.

19:07.930 --> 19:08.529
CHARLIE'S RIGHT.

19:08.531 --> 19:10.264
I'M NOT GONNA LET
SOME FAKE MR. HANKEY

19:10.266 --> 19:10.998
SPOIL MY HOLIDAYS.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.267
I'VE BEEN SUCH A BASTARD
ALL THESE YEARS

19:13.269 --> 19:14.635
AND I FINALLY
UNDERSTAND.

19:14.637 --> 19:16.270
AND IT FEELS GREAT.

19:16.272 --> 19:19.540
I FEEL LIKE I'M IN

CHIEF.

20:06.055 --> 20:07.821
COME ON MANSON,
YOU BELONG IN JAIL.

20:07.823 --> 20:08.889
YOU'RE DARN
RIGHT I DO.

20:08.891 --> 20:11.024
WELL, I GUESS I'LL BE
GOING, MOM AND DAD.

20:11.026 --> 20:12.292
I HOPE YOU CAN
FORGIVE ME.

20:12.294 --> 20:14.294
OF COURSE WE
FORGIVE YOU, SON.

20:14.296 --> 20:16.864
IT WAS NICE OF YOU TO
POP IN FOR THE HOLIDAYS.

20:16.866 --> 20:19.767
YES, NOW WATCH THAT
ASS IN PRISON, SON.

20:19.769 --> 20:21.068
I ALWAYS DO.

20:21.070 --> 20:22.469
SEE YOU ERIC,
THANKS FOR ALL
YOUR HELP.

20:22.471 --> 20:23.337
SEE YOU,
UNCLE HOWARD.

20:23.339 --> 20:24.938
THANKS FOR BEING SUCH
A GREAT ROLE MODEL FOR ME.

20:24.940 --> 20:25.806
...PIECE OF CRAP.

20:25.808 --> 20:28.375
I HOPE YOU CAN
FORGIVE ME TOO, MOM.

20:28.377 --> 20:29.276
OH STANLEY,

20:29.278 --> 20:30.444
LET'S JUST FORGET
THE WHOLE THING

20:30.446 --> 20:31.912
AND HAVE A NICE
HOLIDAY BACK HOME.

20:31.914 --> 20:32.546
REALLY?

20:32.548 --> 20:35.482
SURE, WE'LL PUNISH YOU
AFTER THE HOLIDAYS.

20:35.484 --> 20:36.450
HOORAY!

20:36.452 --> 20:37.785
WAIT, WHAT?

20:37.787 --> 20:40.120
AND SO MANSON IS HAULED
OFF TO JAIL TO ROT
IN HIS CELL.

20:40.122 --> 20:41.221
EVERYTHING IS
BACK TO NORMAL

20:41.223 --> 20:43.490
AND I GUESS THE ONLY
THING LEFT TO SAY IS,

20:43.492 --> 20:46.727
GOD BLESS US,
EVERYONE.

20:46.729 --> 20:49.229
AND I GUESS THAT'S
WHAT I'VE LEARNED.

20:49.231 --> 20:50.397
I'M SORRY
FOR WHAT I DID.

20:50.399 --> 20:52.199
BUT THAT DOESN'T
MAKE UP FOR IT.

20:52.201 --> 20:53.534
I DESERVE TO
BE IN JAIL.

20:53.536 --> 20:54.168
ALL I HOPE IS

20:54.170 --> 20:56.003
I DON'T MAKE MANKIND
LOSE FAITH IN ITSELF.

20:56.005 --> 20:57.438
YES, THERE'S MURDERS
IN THE WORLD,

20:57.440 --> 20:58.739
THERE'S RAPISTS
AND THIEVES.

20:58.741 --> 21:00.307
BUT THOSE ARE
THE VAST MINORITY.

21:00.309 --> 21:01.608
THE MAJORITY
OF MANKIND

21:01.610 --> 21:02.910
IS MADE UP OF
CARING PEOPLE.

21:02.912 --> 21:04.678
WHO TRY EVERY DAY TO DO
WHAT THEY THINK IS RIGHT.

21:04.680 --> 21:06.480
AND THAT'S THE SPIRIT
OF THE SEASON.

21:06.482 --> 21:08.749
WHAT DO YOU
THINK, GUYS?

21:08.751 --> 21:11.985
IT SUCKS, JUST LIKE
ALL YOUR OTHER BOOKS.

21:14.457 --> 21:16.490
WELL, GOODNIGHT
YOU GUYS.

21:16.492 --> 21:17.724
HAPPY HOLIDAYS.
