WEBVTT

00:19.937 --> 00:22.314
Man, we can't even get a goal
for an exhibition match.

00:22.314 --> 00:23.398
Friendly.

00:23.398 --> 00:25.234
Ain't nothing friendly
about what happened out here.

00:25.234 --> 00:27.069
They call exhibition matches friendlies.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.281
Man, this sport drives me nuts.

00:34.201 --> 00:37.246
Rebecca. My apologies.

00:37.246 --> 00:41.375
Now, you've come all the way to Amsterdam,
and we at Ajax have been such rude hosts.

00:42.543 --> 00:46.839
Marjolein, you've been more than gracious.
Especially given the circumstances.

00:51.760 --> 00:52.761
There we are.

01:02.771 --> 01:03.814
Till next time.

01:04.690 --> 01:05.649
Thank you.

01:06.650 --> 01:09.194
Truly was an honor to play here
at the Johan Croyff Arena.

01:09.194 --> 01:15.284
No. The honor is ours completely.
But it is pronounced Johan Cruijff.

01:16.451 --> 01:17.286
Still.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.627
God, this song's depressing.

01:28.881 --> 01:30.215
Would you agree that

01:30.215 --> 01:32.384
this has been
an extremely demoralizing result?

01:32.384 --> 01:34.887
But, luckily our spirits
were already broken.

01:34.887 --> 01:40.434
Yeah. And so, Roy Kent, don't you think
Richmond's objectively poor performance

01:40.434 --> 01:44.271
is due to the fact that you're nothing
without Zava?

01:44.271 --> 01:48.525
Who cares? It's a fucking friendly.
A friendly is a pretend match.

01:48.525 --> 01:50.402
This is a pretend conversation.

01:50.402 --> 01:52.696
You're a pretend person
with a pretend job.

01:52.696 --> 01:55.490
And I'm having a really hard time
pretending to give a shit.

01:55.490 --> 01:56.408
Wow.

01:57.159 --> 01:57.993
Right.

01:59.369 --> 02:00.370
Jan...

02:00.370 --> 02:02.122
- Hi. Thanks.
- Hi. Love the pink.

02:05.584 --> 02:08.669
Okay, a night out in Amsterdam it is.

02:08.669 --> 02:11.256
Let's make the best of it.
What's the plan?

02:11.256 --> 02:12.799
I'm spoken for, I'm afraid.

02:12.799 --> 02:14.676
It's my first time in Amsterdam,

02:14.676 --> 02:18.347
and I have a date with someone special
in the red-light district.

02:24.311 --> 02:25.395
Nah.

02:26.271 --> 02:29.233
- Just you and me then, kid.
- I'd love to--

02:29.733 --> 02:32.486
- That's a quick cancellation.
- How'd you know I was gonna cancel?

02:32.486 --> 02:34.696
Because there's a certain note
in your vocal range

02:34.696 --> 02:37.115
that you only ever hit
when you're being preemptively apologetic.

02:37.115 --> 02:39.451
- Come on. Out with it.
- All right.

02:39.451 --> 02:44.248
Apparently,
tonight is the best aurora borealis ever.

02:44.248 --> 02:47.835
Like, it's the aurora "boreal-iest."
In Norway.

02:48.752 --> 02:52.256
And Jack and her plane are waiting
for me at the airport right now.

02:52.965 --> 02:53.966
Subtle.

02:56.009 --> 02:56.844
And amazing.

02:57.803 --> 02:58.720
Go.

02:58.720 --> 03:00.931
- I promise I'll make it up to you.
- Yes, you will.

03:02.099 --> 03:03.100
Great job, Jan.

03:04.601 --> 03:07.271
And, Roy, thank you again for doing this.

03:07.271 --> 03:09.398
Yeah. Anytime.

03:11.066 --> 03:12.317
- I love you.
- I love you.

03:18.490 --> 03:21.451
- Where's she going?
- Somewhere that believes they deserve her.

03:48.520 --> 03:49.396
Hey, there he is.

03:54.276 --> 03:55.736
- Someone's in a mood.
- Yeah.

03:59.489 --> 04:00.616
- Wait.
- Actually...

04:12.711 --> 04:13.712
What do you think?

04:14.296 --> 04:17.673
Think only you can get these guys out
of their pineapple percussions.

04:19.968 --> 04:21.845
Doldrums. Nice.

04:23.055 --> 04:24.097
Yeah, I'm gonna say something.

04:25.849 --> 04:27.226
Hey, fellas.

04:27.226 --> 04:31.813
I'm about to say three words no coach
ever says unless he dang well means it.

04:31.813 --> 04:33.649
-"You're all shit."
- No.

04:33.649 --> 04:35.609
-"Knowledge is power"?
- True, but no.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.277
-"Live, laugh, love."
- No.

04:37.277 --> 04:40.155
Correct answer is: "No curfew tonight."

04:41.114 --> 04:42.533
- What?
- That's right.

04:42.533 --> 04:44.201
I don't wanna see your pretty faces

04:44.201 --> 04:46.245
until we get back on this bus
at what time, Coach?

04:46.245 --> 04:47.371
10:00 a.m., baby!

04:47.371 --> 04:49.164
You heard the man. 10:00 a.m.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.710
All right, let's be careful out there.
Hill Street Blues.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.297
Smart move, Coach.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.174
Yeah. Well, you know, they need it.

04:59.842 --> 05:01.093
Not as bad as you do.

05:05.055 --> 05:06.807
No curfew in Amsterdam, boys!

05:06.807 --> 05:08.892
Should we all take naps
so we can stay up later?

05:08.892 --> 05:10.727
No. We push through,

05:10.727 --> 05:12.521
and we all meet
in the lobby five o'clock sharp.

05:12.521 --> 05:13.814
Yeah!

05:14.857 --> 05:16.525
Tonight is gonna be mad, you know!

05:17.234 --> 05:18.652
Not for you, Tartt!

05:20.237 --> 05:21.071
Let's go.

05:22.072 --> 05:23.156
You serious?

05:23.156 --> 05:25.200
You're not on fucking holiday
from training.

05:26.827 --> 05:27.953
What about my stuff?

05:28.579 --> 05:29.663
Right.

05:31.790 --> 05:33.250
Throw this away, please.

05:35.294 --> 05:36.170
Let's go!

05:36.170 --> 05:38.755
Great. Sick. You have fun.

05:39.339 --> 05:42.134
Gonna see the sights. Training. Amsterdam.

05:42.134 --> 05:44.970
- Don't actually throw that away, yeah?
- Okay.

05:44.970 --> 05:46.555
Hey. Wait up, Coach!

05:46.555 --> 05:48.182
Getting off the coach, Coach.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.017
Run!

05:57.065 --> 05:58.150
This is gonna be so good.

05:58.150 --> 06:00.652
Hey. How about you roll with me tonight?

06:01.570 --> 06:03.030
That'd be wonderful. Thank you.

06:03.030 --> 06:08.660
Yeah. Great.
Our first stop: the red-light district.

06:40.275 --> 06:44.404
Did you know Amsterdam's origins
date back to the 13th century?

06:46.281 --> 06:47.491
That's mad, innit?

06:49.451 --> 06:50.577
Coach, this way.

06:55.582 --> 06:59.336
This is the world-famous Skinny Bridge!

07:00.170 --> 07:01.004
Yeah?

07:01.004 --> 07:05.425
As seen in major motion picture,
James Bond's Diamonds Are Forever.

07:05.425 --> 07:08.178
Stop with all the fucking
sightseeing shit, you twat.

07:08.178 --> 07:11.265
Right.
Next stop, Amsterdam's thinnest house.

07:11.265 --> 07:15.769
It's gonna blow your mind, lad.
Come on. Get moving, lad.

07:26.071 --> 07:27.072
Hello.

07:27.072 --> 07:28.490
<i>Stinky, what's wrong?</i>

07:28.490 --> 07:31.243
- Nothing. Why?
- Bullshit!

07:31.243 --> 07:34.538
<i>I felt warm in my belly,
so there must be a problem. Out with it.</i>

07:34.538 --> 07:37.082
Sass, you know,
you're actually wrong this time.

07:37.082 --> 07:38.292
<i>I am never wrong.</i>

07:39.168 --> 07:40.002
Jesus.

07:40.752 --> 07:42.087
<i>What are all those bells?</i>

07:42.087 --> 07:43.422
<i>Are you in a casino?</i>

07:43.422 --> 07:49.011
No. I'm actually just out
having a stroll in Amsterdam on my own.

07:52.681 --> 07:55.893
Completely unburdened.
I haven't even got my bag with me.

07:57.519 --> 08:01.064
<i>Oh, right. Amsterdam.
I forgot. Jealous.</i>

08:01.064 --> 08:03.400
<i>Well, eat a space cake for me
and call me when you freak out.</i>

08:03.400 --> 08:05.527
- I love you.
- Buh-buh-bye.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.535
- Yeah.
- Yes?

08:13.535 --> 08:15.495
I saw you walking just there,
and I thought,

08:15.495 --> 08:17.706
"I have to say something
to this beautiful woman."

08:19.249 --> 08:21.835
Right. What exactly were you--

08:22.419 --> 08:24.129
Oh, my God. Oh, my! Go--

08:26.089 --> 08:27.090
Shit.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.261
Oh, my God!

08:32.261 --> 08:33.347
Are you hurt?

08:33.347 --> 08:35.557
No. I'm okay.

08:36.767 --> 08:38.143
- It's just very cold.
- Come on.

08:38.143 --> 08:40.645
Sorry, did you see where my phone went?

08:41.230 --> 08:42.773
Who cares? You're alive. Come on.

08:42.773 --> 08:46.318
Yeah. Yes. Okay. It's my phone, so...

08:53.325 --> 08:54.159
Fair enough.

08:54.159 --> 08:56.245
Come. You need to get warm.

08:57.371 --> 08:59.498
What is it that you wanted to tell me?

09:01.333 --> 09:02.835
You're walking on the bike lane.

09:03.377 --> 09:06.088
I mean,
how the fuck am I supposed to know that?

09:06.088 --> 09:07.673
Stupid fucking place.

09:08.465 --> 09:09.299
Come on.

09:09.883 --> 09:12.845
Like, remember when Jordan
wouldn't wear Reebok in the '92 Olympics?

09:12.845 --> 09:13.804
Of course.

09:13.804 --> 09:16.515
'74 World Cup,
Cruyff refuses to wear Adidas,

09:16.515 --> 09:19.393
they gotta make him a special
two-striped shirt. He was a badass.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.812
But he was also a paragon of the '60s,

09:21.812 --> 09:23.981
so he was bigger than Jordan, really.

09:23.981 --> 09:26.275
He was like Jordan
and John Lennon combined.

09:26.775 --> 09:27.901
That's cool.

09:27.901 --> 09:30.571
- You pick a place to eat yet?
- Oh, shoot. No, I forgot.

09:31.154 --> 09:31.989
On it.

09:33.156 --> 09:33.991
Let's see.

09:36.869 --> 09:39.663
Hey! This could be good.
Yankee Doodle Burger Barn.

09:39.663 --> 09:44.626
"An authentic American dining experience
with American-sized portions."

09:44.626 --> 09:47.004
You know, I could definitely go
for a little taste of home.

09:47.004 --> 09:49.548
- How's that sound, Coach?
- What's it rated?

09:50.132 --> 09:51.133
2.7.

09:52.176 --> 09:53.260
Out of five.

09:53.844 --> 09:55.053
Think we can beat that.

09:56.054 --> 09:57.055
All right.

10:02.728 --> 10:04.730
I don't know what's going
on with me, Coach.

10:05.230 --> 10:08.400
It's like I'm feeling stuck
or something, you know?

10:09.359 --> 10:12.029
I need to do something
to help me get me out of my head.

10:12.613 --> 10:15.449
Like get punched in the face or

10:16.366 --> 10:19.244
drink a couple of bottles of red wine
and yell at my mom.

10:19.870 --> 10:22.664
You know, just--
I wanna try something new.

10:23.165 --> 10:24.541
Help me get inspired.

10:26.960 --> 10:30.088
I've been waiting for you
to say those words for a very long time.

10:43.519 --> 10:45.854
We should have took a train
to Paris a long time ago.

10:46.522 --> 10:48.273
Would any of you gentlemen care
for some drinks?

10:48.273 --> 10:49.358
Leffe Blond.

10:49.358 --> 10:51.401
- I'll have a beer and a shot of te--
- No!

10:52.069 --> 10:53.820
We're about to head out, but thank you.

10:53.820 --> 10:54.905
No worries.

10:55.697 --> 10:57.282
Okay. Yeah. That's everyone.

10:57.282 --> 11:00.202
So, what's the plan for the night then,
Captain?

11:00.202 --> 11:02.329
I'm taking all your suggestions.

11:02.329 --> 11:05.582
For me, the best option for a night
in Amsterdam is a train to Paris.

11:06.708 --> 11:09.545
I told you--
I'm gonna say it again. I am not kidding.

11:09.545 --> 11:12.589
You know, my father actually suggested
we take a boat tour through the canal.

11:12.589 --> 11:15.008
- Yeah. Great way to see the city.
- We're near The Hague.

11:15.008 --> 11:17.094
We can go
to the International Court of Justice.

11:17.094 --> 11:19.263
Poke around. Ask some questions.

11:20.389 --> 11:21.640
I would like to see a tulip.

11:21.640 --> 11:24.393
- You mean tulip fields?
- No. Just one tulip.

11:24.393 --> 11:26.854
An entire field
will be incredibly overwhelming.

11:26.854 --> 11:30.691
Wait. Y'all are joking, right?
We gotta go to a live sex show.

11:31.191 --> 11:32.609
Very cultural, Thierry.

11:33.610 --> 11:35.779
Yo, Trent! What should we do?

11:37.739 --> 11:40.200
Well,
the city has a wonderful museum culture.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.995
In fact, tonight is what's known
as Museumnacht,

11:42.995 --> 11:44.621
where they stay open till quite late.

11:46.915 --> 11:48.667
I didn't come to Amsterdam
to learn things.

11:48.667 --> 11:49.960
Yeah.

11:49.960 --> 11:51.670
- Sorry, Trent.
- Great shot though.

11:52.296 --> 11:54.006
I don't know. The city does seem lovely,

11:54.006 --> 11:56.466
but maybe it would just be easier
if all of us stayed in

11:56.466 --> 11:58.510
and enjoyed a nice team movie night.

12:01.597 --> 12:02.890
Sam, come on.

12:02.890 --> 12:04.808
Hey, boys. Have fun tonight.

12:04.808 --> 12:06.226
Higgins. Where you going?

12:06.810 --> 12:10.147
Tonight's the night young William here
becomes a man.

12:11.315 --> 12:12.316
Cheers.

12:16.987 --> 12:18.614
Nah.

12:19.239 --> 12:21.992
Jan Maas, we're on your home turf.
What you got for us?

12:21.992 --> 12:23.452
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Good point. Let's go.

12:23.452 --> 12:26.455
Okay, tourists, thank you for getting
all those terrible ideas out of the way.

12:27.372 --> 12:31.585
Now listen, my cousin, Martin Garrix,
is deejaying

12:31.585 --> 12:33.962
- at a private all-night party.
- I guess it's his cousin.

12:33.962 --> 12:37.049
We're talking drinking,
dancing and women into the morning,

12:37.049 --> 12:40.052
which is when they'll be serving
a hearty breakfast.

12:42.429 --> 12:45.766
Hey, guys, I'm sorry. Sorry.
I think I need to bow out.

12:45.766 --> 12:49.019
Yeah. I ate some pickled herring earlier,
and now my stomach's bothering me.

12:50.062 --> 12:53.232
- You're gonna miss the live sex show, bro.
- You mean the party.

12:53.232 --> 12:55.150
I cannot wait
to hear all the dirty details.

12:55.943 --> 12:56.944
Good luck, gents.

12:56.944 --> 12:57.986
- See you later.
- All right.

12:57.986 --> 12:58.987
All right, broski.

13:00.322 --> 13:01.240
Hydrate!

13:02.074 --> 13:04.910
Right. So it seems like
this private party is the obvious answer?

13:04.910 --> 13:06.411
- Yep.
- Okay, great.

13:06.411 --> 13:09.206
We just gotta take the bus to Groningen,
which is only a two-hour drive.

13:09.206 --> 13:10.123
Two hours?

13:10.123 --> 13:12.167
- It breezes over.
- Two.

13:12.167 --> 13:13.210
You will love it.

13:13.210 --> 13:15.629
Hey, amigos. Why don't we just split up?

13:16.547 --> 13:17.881
The tulips with me!

13:17.881 --> 13:20.133
No! Overruled.

13:20.717 --> 13:23.637
We pick one place, and we go as a team.

13:24.179 --> 13:27.558
Excuse me.
I think we're gonna order them drinks now.

13:27.558 --> 13:31.103
And can you bring me
a giant stack of napkins? Thanks.

13:32.521 --> 13:33.522
Voting time.

13:33.522 --> 13:35.899
- Dude, a sex show is funny.
- We're not going to a sex show.

13:35.899 --> 13:38.986
I really want the tulip experience
that everyone talks about.

13:41.446 --> 13:46.034
Actually surprisingly good water pressure
for a boat.

13:49.037 --> 13:50.038
Hello?

14:03.385 --> 14:05.220
Oh, shit.

14:11.768 --> 14:12.769
Hello?

14:35.542 --> 14:37.085
Hello?

15:30.597 --> 15:31.807
Fuck me.

15:33.225 --> 15:35.978
Right down there's the bench
from Fault in Our Stars!

15:39.398 --> 15:40.399
The movie!

15:43.110 --> 15:43.986
Tourist!

15:46.280 --> 15:47.322
So, red-light district.

15:47.906 --> 15:51.618
- That's right.
- Cool. Okay. Awesome.

15:53.871 --> 15:55.831
- Is everything all right at home or--
- Here we are.

15:58.709 --> 16:00.460
His name was Chet Baker.

16:00.460 --> 16:05.716
American, gifted trumpeter,
unique singer and a heroin addict.

16:06.717 --> 16:08.802
He was tortured by demons,

16:08.802 --> 16:11.847
but they didn't stop him
from making beautiful music.

16:13.849 --> 16:16.435
He's what got me into jazz
in the first place, you know.

16:17.186 --> 16:19.229
You hear his story and you think,

16:19.897 --> 16:21.857
"There's nothing more punk rock
than that."

16:22.774 --> 16:26.278
Then, on the 13th of May, 1988,

16:27.654 --> 16:29.156
he passed away on this very spot.

16:29.948 --> 16:31.909
Wow. How was it he died?

16:33.035 --> 16:36.455
He fell from that window up there.

16:37.664 --> 16:40.542
But was it an accident?
Did he jump, or was he pushed?

16:42.336 --> 16:44.296
And we're gonna solve
that mystery tonight.

16:44.880 --> 16:49.510
No. We're just here
to pay our respects to a legend.

16:50.052 --> 16:51.929
What led to his death?
We don't know, Will.

16:52.721 --> 16:56.183
- We only know this: drugs are bad.
- Yes.

16:56.183 --> 16:57.893
- No, they are.
- Yeah.

16:58.727 --> 17:01.980
My man, Kenneth the bus driver,
hooked me up a couple of weeks ago.

17:03.190 --> 17:04.191
Wait, so you travel with it?

17:04.191 --> 17:05.983
I thought they had plenty
of that stuff here.

17:05.983 --> 17:09.195
Well, I just don't like my medicine
to be taxed.

17:11.823 --> 17:12.824
I don't know, Coach.

17:12.824 --> 17:17.412
You know, I've always been more
of a beer man or Sour Patch Kids.

17:17.412 --> 17:21.583
Sour Patch Kids don't form literal
new pathways in your brain.

17:22.917 --> 17:26.421
Picture a sheet of fresh,
white snow covering all the footsteps

17:26.421 --> 17:28.257
of all the paths that you've trod before,

17:29.049 --> 17:34.346
forcing you--
nay, encouraging you-- to begin anew.

17:35.889 --> 17:37.182
And how's it taste?

17:37.182 --> 17:41.603
Disgusting, so most people put it
in peanut butter and jelly or yogurt.

17:41.603 --> 17:43.272
Uh-huh. And which one we doing?

17:43.272 --> 17:46.775
Neither. We're doing tea.

17:48.443 --> 17:50.362
Oh, come on, man. Are you kidding me?

17:50.362 --> 17:54.741
That's like hiding poop
inside a smoothie of barf.

17:57.494 --> 17:58.704
I don't say this often enough

17:58.704 --> 18:02.165
because I generally think it's implied,
but trust me.

18:08.714 --> 18:10.299
This is how you change your mind.

18:28.901 --> 18:30.444
I can't do it, Coach. I'm sorry.

18:33.614 --> 18:34.615
Oh, boy.

18:37.075 --> 18:38.118
Did you have any?

18:45.876 --> 18:48.253
- Where we at?
- We have nine votes for sex show.

18:50.631 --> 18:52.090
Nine votes for private party.

18:53.008 --> 18:55.010
And one vote for tulip.

18:59.598 --> 19:02.893
That leaves us with two.
Sex show versus private party.

19:02.893 --> 19:06.396
And I think someone picked tulip, yes?
But who?

19:06.897 --> 19:09.900
Dani, you wrote it in Spanish.

19:11.318 --> 19:14.738
Someone wrote it in Spanish, yes.

19:14.738 --> 19:20.410
Look, it doesn't matter what we choose.
This has to be unanimous. Discuss.

19:20.410 --> 19:22.204
Okay, the idea of seeing a sex show

19:22.204 --> 19:24.831
is one that makes me more uncomfortable
than aroused.

19:25.624 --> 19:26.750
Right? Right.

19:26.750 --> 19:29.795
Which is why I'm still in favor of,
you know, a nice, simple movie night.

19:30.879 --> 19:34.716
But as I said earlier,

19:34.716 --> 19:37.845
Jan's admittedly inconvenient plan
is an excellent second option.

19:37.845 --> 19:41.557
Yeah? Yes? Okay.
Great. All right. Let's go.

19:41.557 --> 19:43.725
Wh-- No. Guys. Stick with me.

19:43.725 --> 19:46.979
We're two hours away from that party.

19:47.604 --> 19:53.193
But we're only ten minutes away
from watching some sex. Come on.

19:55.028 --> 19:56.280
Things flying about...

19:56.280 --> 20:00.284
Can you please tell my friend
that he is being a boring tourist?

20:01.285 --> 20:04.162
- What is your name?
- Everybody calls me Van Damme.

20:07.749 --> 20:13.881
Okay, Van Damme, would you prefer to pay
to watch two tired people have sex

20:13.881 --> 20:18.051
or rather go to a party
where perhaps you could get some yourself?

20:19.303 --> 20:20.429
They're tired?

20:20.429 --> 20:22.014
Exhausted.

20:27.352 --> 20:30.606
We can finally start our night
in Amsterdam!

20:30.606 --> 20:32.149
In Groningen, yes!

20:32.149 --> 20:34.359
No, wait. We need to eat first, right?

20:34.943 --> 20:38.030
Yes. Definitely.
Okay. What do you want to eat?

20:38.030 --> 20:39.364
- Ramen.
- Shawarma!

20:39.364 --> 20:40.908
No way. We haven't eaten...

20:40.908 --> 20:42.743
Some brownies with marijuana.
Or maybe some Mexican?

21:02.095 --> 21:05.224
- Hello?
- It's me. Is it okay to come in?

21:06.517 --> 21:10.521
Yeah, of course. It's your house... boat.

21:11.230 --> 21:12.064
Hi.

21:14.483 --> 21:16.276
You really didn't need to leave.

21:16.276 --> 21:20.155
No, but taking a shower on a stranger's
boat is uncomfortable enough.

21:20.822 --> 21:24.952
And you shouldn't be worried that
he's watching you through some peephole.

21:26.078 --> 21:27.829
- Peephole?
- Yeah.

21:27.829 --> 21:29.706
Someone's dated themselves.

21:30.666 --> 21:35.420
Had you down as more of a webcam kind
of guy-- Anyway, thank you, nonetheless.

21:36.004 --> 21:37.047
You're bleeding.

21:37.047 --> 21:38.715
- I'm what?
- You're bleeding.

21:39.341 --> 21:40.342
What?

21:41.176 --> 21:44.012
- Oh, God.
- Yeah, don't worry. Take a seat.

21:46.098 --> 21:47.808
I don't even know how that happened.

21:49.935 --> 21:51.270
I was in the military.

21:51.979 --> 21:53.355
I trained for this.

21:54.773 --> 21:57.025
And I don't want blood on my floor.

21:58.026 --> 21:59.570
- Hey?
- Yep.

22:03.740 --> 22:04.992
You got strong ankles.

22:05.617 --> 22:09.162
Yes. I wear a lot of high heels for work.

22:09.955 --> 22:11.790
All right. There you go.

22:17.337 --> 22:19.214
Sorry. Force of habit.

22:19.715 --> 22:21.091
It's all that military training.

22:26.346 --> 22:29.433
And the tea was really lovely. Thank you.

22:30.434 --> 22:32.644
Would it perhaps be more lovely
if we added some brandy?

22:36.023 --> 22:40.611
No. I'm just going to wait
till my clothes have dried

22:40.611 --> 22:42.696
and then I'll pop off.

22:45.574 --> 22:48.285
In two hours and 40 minutes.

22:49.620 --> 22:50.454
Okay.

22:52.039 --> 22:55.167
If you don't wanna wait, I can call a cab
for you and your bag of wet clothes,

22:55.167 --> 22:56.627
or I can make dinner.

22:59.546 --> 23:02.174
Well, yes, I am quite hungry actually.

23:02.174 --> 23:08.514
And wet clothes are rather heavy
in a bag, so... yes.

23:08.514 --> 23:11.099
Fuck it. That'd be nice.

23:11.099 --> 23:14.436
- Good! Gezellig?
- Yep.

23:15.395 --> 23:16.396
Wait.

23:22.819 --> 23:24.488
Feel free to change into one of these.

23:34.623 --> 23:39.878
Should I be concerned that you've got
a giant Tupperware box of women's clothing

23:39.878 --> 23:42.339
in your floating house?

23:43.048 --> 23:44.800
These aren't trophies, are they?

23:44.800 --> 23:49.263
No. It's my former partner.
She was tall, like you.

23:50.430 --> 23:52.307
I'm sorry. Did she pass away?

23:53.976 --> 23:56.812
Unfortunately, no.

23:58.397 --> 23:59.481
Please help yourself.

24:00.566 --> 24:06.321
I-- Look, I don't really think I can
borrow your ex-- God, this is lovely.

24:06.321 --> 24:09.491
Please, change.
We'll eat, and then you'll go, all right?

24:10.909 --> 24:12.494
Yeah. Sure.

24:12.494 --> 24:15.080
And after dinner
I can give you a foot massage.

24:15.080 --> 24:17.165
Absolutely not.

24:17.165 --> 24:19.835
Are you sure? My technique is sound.

24:20.752 --> 24:23.255
I'm sure it is, but I will pass.

24:23.839 --> 24:29.511
Okay, then. Fine. Stand there
with tired feet, completely sober.

24:31.013 --> 24:32.723
It does not affect me at all.

24:38.395 --> 24:40.355
Fine. Come on, then. I'll have a bit.

24:49.072 --> 24:49.907
<i>Gezellig.</i>

24:51.241 --> 24:55.329
They put a dam on the river Amstel.
"Amsteldam."

24:55.829 --> 24:59.208
Amsterdam. It's good, innit?

24:59.208 --> 25:02.794
- Come on.
- Fucking stop for a fucking second!

25:03.754 --> 25:04.922
Please.

25:07.799 --> 25:08.967
God.

25:10.719 --> 25:13.805
How do you know so much about here?

25:14.431 --> 25:16.391
It's Amsterdam. How do you not?

25:16.391 --> 25:17.726
Never been here in my life.

25:17.726 --> 25:20.229
- What? Never?
- No.

25:20.812 --> 25:22.814
- Not one stag party?
- No.

25:22.814 --> 25:24.733
- Not one international match?
- No.

25:24.733 --> 25:27.152
Not one emergency flight diverted here

25:27.152 --> 25:28.904
because some EasyJet passenger
was being a prick?

25:28.904 --> 25:30.572
- That never happens.
- It does.

25:30.572 --> 25:34.826
It does happen, if you're being enough
of a prick. Which I was.

25:35.577 --> 25:37.788
It just looks like
a Disney version of an old city.

25:37.788 --> 25:39.414
It all looks so fucking fake.

25:39.414 --> 25:40.582
It's not fake.

25:41.083 --> 25:44.336
Come on. Windmills? Fake.

25:45.045 --> 25:47.422
I ain't even from here, and I'm offended.

25:48.298 --> 25:50.259
Windmills are real, man.
What are you talking about?

25:50.259 --> 25:51.718
Yeah, I'll believe it when I see it.

25:55.764 --> 25:56.974
We need bikes.

25:58.100 --> 25:59.852
What? No.

26:21.665 --> 26:24.042
- You know, Coach, if you wanna go--
- I'll see you in the morning.

26:56.742 --> 26:57.743
Hey.

26:58.285 --> 26:59.620
Hi. Can I help you?

26:59.620 --> 27:00.996
Have you got vanilla vodka?

27:01.705 --> 27:02.789
Dear God, no.

27:03.916 --> 27:05.542
A beer, please. Thank you.

27:12.633 --> 27:14.343
- There you go, sweetie.
- Thanks.

27:14.343 --> 27:17.679
Hey, can I ask, do you know who I am?

27:19.223 --> 27:20.557
Can I tell you a secret?

27:21.934 --> 27:24.478
Tonight, you're whoever you want to be.

27:25.646 --> 27:26.480
Yeah.

27:26.480 --> 27:28.899
You should stick around for the party
later on. Thunderdong.

27:28.899 --> 27:30.484
Good vibes, good place to make friends.

27:30.484 --> 27:31.652
Sounds fun, I'm in.

27:32.236 --> 27:33.529
Trent! Hey.

27:34.905 --> 27:37.658
Can I get a drink
for my work acquaintance, please?

27:38.575 --> 27:40.702
Sorry, did you say Thunderdong?

27:43.664 --> 27:47.084
I think I'm in the wrong place.
My mistake. Cheers.

27:49.169 --> 27:50.295
Happens all the time.

27:50.879 --> 27:51.713
Yeah.

27:55.175 --> 27:56.802
- Colin!
- Good to see you, Trent.

27:57.594 --> 28:00.430
Colin. I already knew.

28:03.767 --> 28:06.812
I've known for months.
I haven't said anything to anyone.

28:09.398 --> 28:12.276
I must have a good reason for that,
mustn't I?

28:14.319 --> 28:15.153
Right.

29:05.162 --> 29:06.747
Your ex has wonderful taste.

29:08.290 --> 29:09.833
Well, actually, she hated that one.

29:11.460 --> 29:13.712
Yeah, of course she did.
I bought it for her.

29:19.176 --> 29:22.054
Hey. Gezellig, right?

29:27.726 --> 29:28.852
That smells wonderful.

29:29.686 --> 29:30.687
It's almost ready.

29:35.025 --> 29:36.318
Would you like a drink?

29:37.653 --> 29:39.988
- I would love one.
- Please, help yourself.

29:45.244 --> 29:50.624
So, should I be worried about some
giant Dutch woman wandering on here

29:50.624 --> 29:52.251
and strangling me for wearing her clothes?

29:52.251 --> 29:53.293
No.

29:54.044 --> 29:57.798
Things are over between us, and have been
so for some time. So don't worry.

29:57.798 --> 29:59.591
It's all right. I didn't mean to--

30:00.092 --> 30:01.760
You don't need to tell me
any of the details.

30:01.760 --> 30:03.053
She was unfaithful.

30:03.637 --> 30:05.973
I loved her very much, so it wrecked me,

30:05.973 --> 30:09.768
and I came dangerously
close to destroying our family on it.

30:12.104 --> 30:14.064
But then, with time,

30:14.064 --> 30:19.278
I realized that this thing didn't happen
to me, it happened for me. You know?

30:27.035 --> 30:28.120
Cheers.

30:28.954 --> 30:29.788
<i>Proost.</i>

30:29.788 --> 30:32.082
- Proost. Prost.
- Proost.

30:32.082 --> 30:33.417
Proust.

30:38.922 --> 30:42.801
Wait, is this some Dutch bloke singing
"She Believes in Me" by Kenny Rogers?

30:42.801 --> 30:47.097
Whoa.
This Dutch bloke is the great André Hazes,

30:47.097 --> 30:49.516
and he's singing "Zij Gelooft in Mij,"
all right?

30:50.142 --> 30:51.143
Okay.

30:51.810 --> 30:54.479
And yes, the Gambling Man did it first.
But--

31:09.369 --> 31:14.499
<i>And who knows
Maybe on some special night</i>

31:14.499 --> 31:17.794
<i>If my song is right</i>

31:17.794 --> 31:22.382
<i>I will find a way</i>

31:39.107 --> 31:41.985
- The fuck are you doing?
- Just be patient.

31:43.195 --> 31:44.196
Bicycle?

31:44.947 --> 31:46.657
Thank you. Two, please.

31:46.657 --> 31:48.867
I love a challenge. Hold this.

31:51.245 --> 31:53.789
Mate. We've just made tonight amazing.

31:53.789 --> 31:55.666
I don't wanna ride around
on a fucking bike.

31:55.666 --> 31:57.251
Oh, come on. It'll be fun.

31:58.502 --> 32:01.547
- Voilà. Sixty euros.
- Have a hundred.

32:02.130 --> 32:03.131
Thank you.

32:03.131 --> 32:04.424
- Here.
- Get it away from me.

32:04.424 --> 32:06.009
- Oh, come on.
- No, I don't want it.

32:06.009 --> 32:07.803
Mate,
we take the bikes, we find a windmill.

32:07.803 --> 32:09.429
- No. I said no.
- Why the fuck not?

32:09.429 --> 32:11.181
I don't know how to ride a bike!

32:26.613 --> 32:27.614
No refunds.

32:29.950 --> 32:33.161
Fucking hell, Roy.
Do you know how to tie your own laces?

32:33.161 --> 32:34.580
Stop being a dick.

32:36.915 --> 32:38.417
When I went to Sunderland,

32:38.417 --> 32:41.336
my granddad told me he'd teach me how
to ride when I came back for Christmas,

32:41.336 --> 32:43.881
and then he fucking died,
and I haven't been on a bike since.

32:46.300 --> 32:47.467
And now I'm saying that out loud,

32:47.467 --> 32:50.262
I realize that never learning was actually
a great disrespect to his memory

32:50.262 --> 32:52.306
and now I feel ashamed.
So can we stop talking about it

32:52.306 --> 32:54.808
and go back to me just taking out
my negative emotions on you,

32:54.808 --> 32:56.435
even if you deserve it or not?

33:04.151 --> 33:07.196
Go on, Roy. For Granddad.

33:13.493 --> 33:14.703
Fuck.

33:17.539 --> 33:22.211
Okay,
you're gonna sit up, look up and pedal.

33:26.340 --> 33:28.133
Straight back up. Just straight back up.

33:28.133 --> 33:31.678
Put your feet on the pedals.
Put your feet on the pedals.

33:32.387 --> 33:34.431
That's it, good. Now pedal.

33:34.431 --> 33:36.225
Put your foot on the ped--

33:36.225 --> 33:38.810
All right. Okay. All right.

33:40.354 --> 33:42.773
On the bike. Okay. There you go.

33:42.773 --> 33:44.650
Pick it up but in an angry way, man.

33:44.650 --> 33:50.572
Good lad. Pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal.
That's it. Hey!

33:50.572 --> 33:53.116
Good lad, pedal it. You actually--
That's it, that's it!

33:53.116 --> 33:54.409
That's good! That's good.

33:54.409 --> 33:56.745
You did it for two seconds there, man.
That's an improvement.

33:56.745 --> 33:58.830
Steady on, mate. Steady on.

33:58.830 --> 34:01.792
Hey! What-- You're doing well, man.
Calm down.

34:03.043 --> 34:04.920
How's that gonna help anyone?

34:04.920 --> 34:07.339
In there. There you go. Good.

34:07.339 --> 34:09.757
- I can't turn the other way.
- Yes. All right. This way.

34:09.757 --> 34:11.385
- I can't turn the other way.
- It's right. Follow me.

34:11.385 --> 34:12.719
- Try and hit me!
- I can't turn.

34:12.719 --> 34:15.264
It's all about balance, man.
Just like dribbling.

34:15.264 --> 34:17.266
If you can dribble, you can balance.
That's it.

34:17.266 --> 34:18.600
Yeah, that's good. You do--

34:18.600 --> 34:20.435
- All right, mate. It's good--
- I'm gonna kill you.

34:20.435 --> 34:22.728
- You're doing it.
- I'm doing it.

34:22.728 --> 34:25.774
Let's go find a fucking windmill!

34:26.608 --> 34:29.945
For Granddad! All right, wait for me.

34:41.915 --> 34:42.916
We're sitting here?

34:43.542 --> 34:46.003
Well, yeah.
You know, you said pick good seats, so...

34:46.003 --> 34:50.047
Yeah, but these are so exposed.

34:51.632 --> 34:55.846
Oh, no. It's like the time I was
front and center at an improv comedy show.

34:56.429 --> 34:58.390
Are they gonna make a song
about how I look like an altar boy?

34:59.099 --> 35:00.726
It's okay. You did great.

35:00.726 --> 35:02.477
- Here's your drink.
- Thank you.

35:03.478 --> 35:04.521
Thank you for doing this, Will.

35:05.772 --> 35:07.357
One pilgrim alone is merely a zealot,

35:07.357 --> 35:10.777
but two pilgrims together,
that's a pilgrimage.

35:12.738 --> 35:13.572
Cheers.

35:14.448 --> 35:15.282
Here we go.

35:20.120 --> 35:25.792
Welcome to Jazz Café Alto. My name is
Dante Charles, and we are the Kartel.

35:31.298 --> 35:33.425
- Miles Davis once said that--
- Yeah.

35:34.176 --> 35:37.095
<i>Remember the night</i>

35:37.971 --> 35:40.641
And that was the second time
I came out to her.

35:41.808 --> 35:43.685
This time, however, she believed me.

35:45.312 --> 35:49.274
And now... we're closer than ever.

35:49.274 --> 35:50.359
And your daughter?

35:51.193 --> 35:52.903
Yeah. She's never been happier.

35:57.699 --> 35:58.700
My point is,

35:59.535 --> 36:02.037
it was really difficult
to hold on to that secret.

36:02.788 --> 36:04.456
But I'm not a professional athlete.

36:06.041 --> 36:07.042
How do you do it?

36:08.752 --> 36:15.342
Well... my whole life is two lives really.

36:17.344 --> 36:18.595
You got my work life.

36:19.596 --> 36:21.682
Like, no one at the club knows.

36:22.391 --> 36:27.479
I'd like to think they wouldn't care,
but it's just easier that way.

36:29.523 --> 36:30.816
Then you got my dating life.

36:32.276 --> 36:33.527
Some guys think it's hot.

36:35.112 --> 36:39.825
Others say they don't care, but eventually
they get tired and they move on.

36:41.076 --> 36:43.704
Then the club brought in Dr. Sharon...

36:45.998 --> 36:48.041
and she helped me realize that I have...

36:50.544 --> 36:51.545
an ache.

36:53.755 --> 36:59.011
An ache for both my lives
to be my only life.

37:02.347 --> 37:03.974
I don't want to be a spokesperson.

37:05.392 --> 37:07.352
I don't want a bunch of apologies.

37:11.648 --> 37:15.777
All I want is for when we win a match,

37:17.237 --> 37:22.868
to be able to kiss my fella the same way
the guys get to kiss their girls.

37:28.540 --> 37:31.001
And I know we can't fix
every ache inside of us.

37:34.004 --> 37:36.340
But I shouldn't have
to pretend it's not there either.

37:46.558 --> 37:48.810
How'd you know? About me?

37:50.062 --> 37:53.649
Well, I used my Holmesian
powers of journalistic deduction.

37:57.152 --> 37:59.321
Saw you kissing a guy
outside Sam's restaurant.

38:01.907 --> 38:02.991
Yeah.

38:05.452 --> 38:07.120
Those are the bells of the Westerkerk.

38:09.540 --> 38:13.293
Anne Frank heard
those same bells every night.

38:14.753 --> 38:15.754
She lived just there.

38:17.047 --> 38:18.924
Right by this big, pink triangle?

38:20.342 --> 38:21.969
Think that came a bit later.

38:23.470 --> 38:24.471
Oh, yeah.

39:07.848 --> 39:09.766
"One doesn't expect to get from life

39:09.766 --> 39:12.477
what one has already learned
it cannot give,

39:13.645 --> 39:19.067
rather, one begins to see
that life is a kind of sowing time...

39:21.195 --> 39:22.905
and the harvest is not yet here."

39:25.657 --> 39:27.618
He was just a humble preacher's son.

39:28.535 --> 39:34.458
And yes, he had his demons, but they never
stopped him from searching for beauty.

39:36.960 --> 39:41.632
Because when you find beauty,
you find inspiration.

39:43.550 --> 39:48.013
If, that is,
you stay as determined as Vincent.

39:49.681 --> 39:53.227
Never stop, no matter how many failures.

39:54.436 --> 39:59.107
When you know you're doing
what you're meant to do, you have to try.

40:04.905 --> 40:05.906
Where I'm from--

40:07.491 --> 40:12.788
Kansas, my home...
This here, this is our state flower.

40:16.500 --> 40:17.543
I want you to have this.

40:20.963 --> 40:22.339
We close in three minutes.

40:23.340 --> 40:24.341
Mercy buckets.

40:25.551 --> 40:26.552
Yep.

40:37.312 --> 40:41.900
We are in Holland!
We should try Dutch food!

40:41.900 --> 40:44.361
- As a Frenchman, I would rather die!
- No!

40:48.991 --> 40:50.742
Enough!

40:50.742 --> 40:54.496
We are riven by this crossroads!

40:57.082 --> 40:58.083
Is this it?

41:01.879 --> 41:04.715
Should we huddle around the laptop
for a movie night?

41:06.633 --> 41:08.635
How else do we proceed?

41:10.512 --> 41:13.432
How doth we channel
this lack of compromise?

41:14.308 --> 41:18.812
This dissension? This rage?

41:20.522 --> 41:21.607
Captain.

41:46.507 --> 41:50.177
Coach. I know that you have
my best interests at heart,

41:50.177 --> 41:52.012
or the club's anyway.

41:52.012 --> 41:53.847
Even though you're clearly upset
about something else

41:53.847 --> 41:55.098
and you're taking it out on me.

41:57.184 --> 41:59.686
What I'm trying to say is,
I'm sorry for being a dick earlier.

42:02.981 --> 42:04.566
I've been to Amsterdam twice.

42:05.317 --> 42:08.445
When I was 14, me dad
was trying to get back with me mum,

42:08.445 --> 42:12.157
and he was acting like some kind of
fucking super dad or some shit,

42:12.658 --> 42:15.410
and he brought me out here
for some father-son bonding time.

42:16.954 --> 42:19.540
Anyway, he said it was
to watch a football match.

42:19.540 --> 42:23.085
After the game, he took me to the
red-light district for my real present.

42:24.628 --> 42:30.467
He took me to lose my virginity
to those ladies behind the windows.

42:31.134 --> 42:34.179
Jesus. Must have been traumatizing.

42:34.930 --> 42:36.348
No. She loved it.

42:38.392 --> 42:39.852
For me-- Sorry, me, you mean.

42:41.478 --> 42:42.312
No.

42:42.896 --> 42:43.897
I don't know.

42:44.815 --> 42:45.816
I don't remember.

42:47.234 --> 42:51.405
Anyway, a couple of years later,
me mum brought me back here.

42:51.405 --> 42:55.242
And we went to museums
and did all the tours,

42:55.242 --> 42:59.621
and it's the first time I had stroopwafel.
Never forget that time.

43:00.914 --> 43:06.003
Even though my dad weren't here, he was
still kinda there with us. You know?

43:10.591 --> 43:12.926
I was a dick today too. I'm sorry.

43:17.389 --> 43:18.974
I think Keeley's got a girlfriend.

43:23.854 --> 43:25.814
Let's go find us some windmills, eh?

43:27.691 --> 43:28.692
Yeah.

43:42.456 --> 43:43.290
Bang.

43:48.712 --> 43:49.755
Howdy, partner.

43:50.339 --> 43:51.173
Hey there.

43:51.173 --> 43:53.509
Welcome to Yankee Doodle Burger Barn.
Table for one?

43:53.509 --> 43:56.428
Wh-- Yes, please. Yeah.
Hey, where in the States you from?

43:56.428 --> 43:57.554
Melbourne.

43:58.263 --> 44:00.265
Plenty of room tonight,
where would you like to sit?

44:00.265 --> 44:02.601
Windy City, Big Apple or Hollywood?

44:02.601 --> 44:06.730
Oh, well. Tell Mama that Roxie Hart
is coming home. Lipschitz.

44:10.234 --> 44:11.235
Chicago.

44:16.990 --> 44:18.158
Windy City.

44:18.158 --> 44:19.660
Great, mate. Giddyap.

44:28.710 --> 44:31.296
Here you are. Your fancy hot dog.

44:34.675 --> 44:35.676
Howdy.

44:35.676 --> 44:38.887
- Can I get some ranch dressing?
- Absolutely, ma'am.

44:39.555 --> 44:41.640
Hey, partner. Here all right?

44:42.474 --> 44:43.308
Yeah.

44:44.476 --> 44:46.395
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

44:49.064 --> 44:51.024
- Oh, no, you didn't.
- Yes.

44:52.651 --> 44:53.819
Well, it actually happened.

45:01.702 --> 45:02.828
Would you like some water?

45:04.580 --> 45:05.581
Wise.

45:09.334 --> 45:10.544
This is so cozy.

45:11.712 --> 45:15.340
The food and the music, the boat and--

45:17.593 --> 45:18.552
It really is--

45:19.052 --> 45:20.095
Gezellig?

45:20.929 --> 45:23.974
You keep saying that word.
Or are you just choking?

45:23.974 --> 45:27.895
- Gezellig. That one?
- That's the one.

45:28.770 --> 45:31.023
- Come on then. What does that mean?
- What--

45:33.025 --> 45:34.484
I don't know. Gezellig.

45:35.235 --> 45:37.779
There is no direct
English translation, I think.

45:38.530 --> 45:41.533
It can mean cozy. Like a warm fire.

45:41.533 --> 45:42.618
Gezellig.

45:43.535 --> 45:45.662
But you can also keep your mind gezellig.

45:46.788 --> 45:51.752
You know, your heart, your soul.
The people you're with. The places you go.

45:51.752 --> 45:52.753
You know?

45:54.296 --> 45:55.797
Even this, right now, here is--

45:55.797 --> 45:56.882
Gezellig.

45:58.634 --> 45:59.843
Exactly.

46:22.157 --> 46:23.492
They feel pretty dry.

46:42.261 --> 46:43.762
All right. Where were we?

46:45.305 --> 46:47.432
Wine.

46:56.817 --> 47:01.613
Here's your onion ring pyramid
and your freedom fries.

47:01.613 --> 47:02.698
Thank you.

47:04.366 --> 47:05.367
You enjoying the game?

47:06.368 --> 47:07.911
Oh, yeah. Hey, you know what?

47:07.911 --> 47:11.081
I bet you a thousand bucks
the Bulls will win 107 to 86.

47:12.249 --> 47:13.417
I'm just kidding.

47:14.918 --> 47:17.754
I remember watching this game
as a kid with my dad.

47:19.631 --> 47:22.134
Yeah. I used to love
watching basketball with him.

47:26.013 --> 47:27.306
Thank you for sharing.

47:28.182 --> 47:32.311
And please feel free to choose
from our menu of 50 Nifty United Sauces.

47:33.478 --> 47:35.314
And there's a lovely queso
from Puerto Rico.

47:36.523 --> 47:40.152
You know what?
How about you just surprise me?

47:40.152 --> 47:41.653
- Can do.
- Thanks.

47:44.531 --> 47:47.159
<i>And the Bulls drop
into their triangle offense,</i>

47:47.159 --> 47:50.078
<i>creating constant movement
between the players.</i>

47:50.078 --> 47:52.539
<i>It's been the key to their success
this season.</i>

47:53.207 --> 47:56.210
<i>It opens up for Jordan. He shoots. Yes!</i>

47:58.462 --> 48:00.172
Pyramid ain't nothing but a triangle.

48:02.508 --> 48:04.843
Actually, three triangles
all leaning on each other.

48:11.183 --> 48:12.184
Howdy, Ted.

48:19.024 --> 48:21.735
Hey. So, how does this one look?

48:25.614 --> 48:26.615
Why'd you bring me this one?

48:27.658 --> 48:29.034
It's the best one.

49:08.699 --> 49:10.033
Well, this is mighty strange.

49:11.118 --> 49:12.119
Hello?

49:14.329 --> 49:15.664
<i>Hello, Ted.</i>

49:15.664 --> 49:18.125
Hey, that's me. Who are you?

49:18.125 --> 49:21.461
<i>I am the True Spirit of Adventure.</i>

49:21.461 --> 49:24.590
I like that. Well, what's shaking, TSA?

49:25.090 --> 49:27.593
<i>Do you know where triangles come from,
Ted?</i>

49:28.135 --> 49:30.262
I don't know.
God dropped a square on the floor

49:30.262 --> 49:31.680
and it broke in half long-ways
or something?

49:31.680 --> 49:33.140
<i>- Whoopsie.
- No, Ted.</i>

49:33.140 --> 49:36.977
<i>It's debated that the triangle
was first defined by Pythagoras</i>

49:36.977 --> 49:40.480
<i>as any shape with three sides
and three corners.</i>

49:40.480 --> 49:41.565
That's a good theorem.

49:41.565 --> 49:45.652
<i>But throughout history, many believe
that triangles have held special powers.</i>

49:45.652 --> 49:46.570
Oh, yeah.

49:46.570 --> 49:50.032
<i>From the Holy Trinity of Christianity
to the trikaya of Buddhism.</i>

49:50.032 --> 49:52.743
<i>There's also that spooky eye thing
on the back of the one-dollar bill.</i>

49:52.743 --> 49:53.952
Oh, yeah.

49:54.620 --> 49:58.457
<i>In some Native American cultures,
the triangle symbolizes home.</i>

49:59.124 --> 50:02.044
I'm sorry Europeans kicked all
them folks out of their triangle.

50:02.044 --> 50:05.589
<i>But the concept of the triangle
reached its zenith in 1989</i>

50:05.589 --> 50:10.219
<i>when a man called Tex Winter,
an assistant coach for your Chicago Bulls,</i>

50:10.219 --> 50:13.222
<i>introduced his triangle offense.</i>

50:13.222 --> 50:14.848
<i>The central component of which was</i>

50:14.848 --> 50:19.269
<i>for a player to always have two available
teammates to whom he could pass the ball.</i>

50:19.978 --> 50:21.563
<i>These three players formed...</i>

50:21.563 --> 50:22.648
A triangle.

50:22.648 --> 50:23.815
<i>Bingo, Ringo.</i>

50:23.815 --> 50:26.610
<i>But that was never the only triangle
on the court.</i>

50:27.319 --> 50:32.407
<i>For when the players moved,
they created more and more triangles.</i>

50:32.407 --> 50:34.660
Hey, you're right.

50:34.660 --> 50:37.162
<i>Actually, Ted, you're right.</i>

50:37.162 --> 50:38.247
<i>Yes!</i>

50:38.247 --> 50:39.957
Howdy, partner.

50:43.210 --> 50:44.878
Hey. Can I borrow a pen?

50:44.878 --> 50:46.380
- Come on, boy!
- Thanks.

50:46.380 --> 50:49.383
<i>Yankee Doodle Burger Barn
Happy birthday</i>

50:49.383 --> 50:52.469
<i>Yankee Doodle Burger Barn
Happy birthday, Mel</i>

50:52.469 --> 50:55.514
<i>World War II was won by America</i>

50:55.514 --> 50:58.475
<i>But the West was liberated
Thanks to Canada</i>

50:58.475 --> 50:59.601
<i>Hey!</i>

51:14.950 --> 51:15.951
Do you play?

51:19.246 --> 51:21.665
Yes, he-- Yes, he does.

51:21.665 --> 51:25.878
He plays bass because Chet Baker--
Chet Ba-- Do you know who Chet Baker is?

51:27.129 --> 51:28.755
All right. Okay.

51:31.592 --> 51:32.676
Players in.

51:36.013 --> 51:37.097
Pillows ready.

51:39.558 --> 51:40.392
Begin!

51:52.905 --> 51:54.364
Let's get lost now.

52:46.875 --> 52:47.876
Vanilla vodka.

53:11.900 --> 53:16.738
- Oh, my God. He's still at it.
- Yeah. It's pretty amazing.

53:17.990 --> 53:19.324
What the hell is he doing?

53:19.992 --> 53:22.411
I don't know. But he's got my pen.

53:22.995 --> 53:25.122
Derek's gonna make you buy a new one.

53:25.122 --> 53:26.832
Fucking hate Derek.

53:27.332 --> 53:28.333
Yeah.

53:59.531 --> 54:00.532
Fuck!

54:03.785 --> 54:07.664
<i>Let's get lost</i>

54:42.950 --> 54:45.327
Good morning.

54:49.206 --> 54:50.040
So...

54:58.757 --> 54:59.758
Last night...

55:02.511 --> 55:03.512
Did we...

55:05.055 --> 55:06.056
Did we?

55:08.141 --> 55:08.976
Did we...

55:13.522 --> 55:14.356
No.

55:21.822 --> 55:22.656
Breakfast?

55:25.200 --> 55:26.952
No. I have to go.

55:29.371 --> 55:30.664
Of course.

55:30.664 --> 55:34.168
But... thank you...

55:38.213 --> 55:39.214
You're welcome...

56:01.486 --> 56:02.613
I won't forget you.

56:03.197 --> 56:04.364
Yeah, you might.

56:07.868 --> 56:09.036
People get Alzheimer's.

56:23.383 --> 56:24.384
Did we?

56:28.388 --> 56:29.640
Oh, yes, we did.

56:32.601 --> 56:36.063
I'm telling you, Amsterdam, amazing.
Like, yes, we lost the game,

56:36.063 --> 56:38.857
but my boss played in a jazz band
and then--

56:47.991 --> 56:51.828
Gerbrandt, Gijs, Gilles, Brechje and Paul...

57:00.754 --> 57:02.005
Okay, doei.

57:02.005 --> 57:03.507
Doei!

57:04.007 --> 57:05.551
- Hey, Will.
- You speak Dutch?

57:05.551 --> 57:07.010
Don't tell Jan. Where's Ted?

57:07.010 --> 57:09.012
- He's in the back.
- Thank you.

57:13.267 --> 57:16.478
Mum? Sorry. Yes, no-- What was I saying?

57:16.478 --> 57:19.231
And then I met the most lovely couple,
and they invited me for a threesome.

57:19.231 --> 57:20.607
Bonjour.

57:26.488 --> 57:27.489
Coach.

57:27.489 --> 57:28.574
Hey, Coach.

57:30.325 --> 57:33.495
Wait, let me guess, Piggy Stardust.

57:33.495 --> 57:36.456
- Rashers to rashers, oink to oinky.
- I love it.

57:40.419 --> 57:41.753
Hey, sorry about last night.

57:42.254 --> 57:43.881
No, that's okay. I'm sorry.

57:43.881 --> 57:46.341
You know, I shouldn't have let you
wander around out there all alone

57:46.341 --> 57:47.718
with a head full of tea, you know.

57:48.302 --> 57:49.720
Good thing it was a dud batch.

57:52.181 --> 57:53.182
What's that?

57:53.182 --> 57:56.059
I wasn't feeling anything.
So I called Kenneth, he tried it,

57:56.059 --> 57:58.395
couple hours later,
calls me up totally contrite.

57:58.395 --> 58:00.105
Confirmed, dud batch.

58:02.107 --> 58:03.150
It happens.

58:07.821 --> 58:08.906
Let me ask you a question here.

58:12.743 --> 58:13.744
Is this anything?

58:19.333 --> 58:22.002
The way I see it,
we've been playing too rigid, you know?

58:22.002 --> 58:23.462
Our guys need freedom.

58:24.505 --> 58:27.925
Go wherever they wanna go.
Follow their guts, their hearts.

58:28.509 --> 58:31.678
As long as they remember to fill
in the space that someone left behind.

58:31.678 --> 58:33.805
They gotta have one another's backs,
that's for sure.

58:35.182 --> 58:38.519
But, you know, it's just constant,
nonstop motion.

58:39.102 --> 58:42.356
Just going from position to position
until positions don't really

58:43.565 --> 58:44.900
even exist anymore.

58:45.734 --> 58:48.278
It's fast, fluid, free.

58:49.988 --> 58:51.156
With full support.

58:55.577 --> 58:57.120
You come up with this yourself?

58:58.038 --> 58:59.039
Yeah?

58:59.039 --> 59:02.501
Congrats.
You should call it Total Football.

59:03.585 --> 59:04.586
I like that.

59:05.295 --> 59:07.506
Which was invented right here
in Holland in the '70s.

59:15.097 --> 59:16.181
You think we should try it?

59:16.974 --> 59:17.975
Yes, I do.

59:19.268 --> 59:21.687
All right, cool. Total Football.

59:24.815 --> 59:25.941
Room for one more?

59:31.321 --> 59:32.573
Hey, boss.

59:36.201 --> 59:40.706
So, 12 unanswered texts,
three un-haha'ed GIFs.

59:42.165 --> 59:43.166
We good?

59:44.042 --> 59:49.756
I'm sorry, Ted.
My phone is at the bottom of a canal.

59:52.509 --> 59:53.510
Is that Keats?

59:54.678 --> 59:55.679
Nope.

1:00:03.061 --> 1:00:04.521
Yeah, okay.

1:00:04.521 --> 1:00:06.315
Hey, Will, how we looking?

1:00:07.191 --> 1:00:08.942
We're two short. Who's missing?

1:00:10.152 --> 1:00:12.321
You lovely people!

1:00:17.075 --> 1:00:18.452
Did you miss me?

1:00:18.452 --> 1:00:19.828
Don't fucking ask.

1:00:20.746 --> 1:00:21.747
Let's go.

1:00:21.747 --> 1:00:23.624
We saw a windmill!

1:00:23.624 --> 1:00:24.708
All right.

1:00:24.708 --> 1:00:25.834
Hell yeah.

1:00:27.669 --> 1:00:28.754
Come on!

1:00:29.338 --> 1:00:31.673
I bet you the sex show was dope though.

1:00:33.842 --> 1:00:35.761
- What?
- Leave it alone, man.

1:00:40.974 --> 1:00:42.476
Everything okay, boss?

1:00:44.061 --> 1:00:48.065
<i>Don't worry, about a thing</i>

1:00:50.317 --> 1:00:54.947
<i>'Cause every little thing's

1:00:55.948 --> 1:00:56.782
Well, I appreciate it.
