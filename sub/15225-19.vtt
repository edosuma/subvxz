that you've got your entire
account sewed up in one stock,

05:25.934 --> 05:29.234
but if you want to bounce up
and down the boards with AT&T,

05:29.267 --> 05:30.834
that's your business.

05:30.868 --> 05:34.934
I'm telling you, Tom,
they're a fly-by-night outfit.

05:34.968 --> 05:37.801
Hold on a second, something
just flashed on the big board.

you're going to say.

06:13.434 --> 06:15.367
I know, you got a
philosophical problem

06:15.400 --> 06:17.200
because there's
a possibility

06:17.234 --> 06:19.501
that something maybe
could go wrong.

Mr. Gray.

10:52.000 --> 10:56.067
I'm going to leave here

I'm sorry.

11:16.367 --> 11:18.601
Uh, Mr. De Palma,
I like to think

11:18.634 --> 11:22.334
that even the most fleeting
and shallow relationships

11:22.367 --> 11:24.567
in this life somehow enrich us.

11:24.601 --> 11:28.033
I think if you take a good look
at this situation

11:28.067 --> 11:30.434
you'll find
you've profited by it.

11:35.801 --> 11:38.100

So long, loser.

it's your turn.

12:06.868 --> 12:07.901
What job did you get?

12:07.934 --> 12:11.434
Um, I got something
in the entertainment field.

12:11.467 --> 12:12.434
All right, Bob!

interesting, Bob.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.100
Well, sort of.

12:15.133 --> 12:16.501
What do you mean sort of?

12:16.534 --> 12:19.033
Well, I had a real hard time
finding anything,

12:19.067 --> 12:21.434
so I took a job
in a department store

12:21.467 --> 12:22.634
doing parties.

12:22.667 --> 12:25.300
People would
have parties

12:25.334 --> 12:26.667
for their children

12:26.701 --> 12:29.567
and they'd hire me
to come to the party

12:29.601 --> 12:31.167
and I'd play a part.

12:31.200 --> 12:33.267
Oh, yeah?
What kind of part?

12:33.300 --> 12:35.200
Um... well,
nothing crazy.

12:35.234 --> 12:38.200
Something pretty
traditional, actually.

12:56.167 --> 12:57.534
that's a nice outfit.

12:57.567 --> 12:59.267
( <i>giggles:</i> )
Thanks a lot,

12:59.300 --> 13:00.801
but you got to understand,

13:00.834 --> 13:02.267
this is not what I do
for a living.

13:02.300 --> 13:03.701
You just do it for fun?

13:03.734 --> 13:05.968
No... not for fun.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.367
I'll get
the kids.

13:07.400 --> 13:08.801
Hey, listen, um...

13:08.834 --> 13:12.167
excuse me, aren't you Cynthia
Beck, the film director?

13:12.200 --> 13:14.300
That's right, I am.

13:14.334 --> 13:18.467
My name's Bobby Wheeler and...
and I just love your work.

13:18.501 --> 13:22.000
Well, I've always admired
your jelly beans.

13:22.033 --> 13:23.734
Hey, listen, actually,
I'm really an actor

13:23.767 --> 13:25.467
and I haven't
done very much,

13:25.501 --> 13:27.234
but I'm really,
really good.

13:27.267 --> 13:28.667
And I'd love to read
for you sometime,

13:28.701 --> 13:30.501
but you're really
hard to get in to see.

13:30.534 --> 13:32.801
Uh, the kids are
kind of restless.

13:32.834 --> 13:34.000
I'll send them
right in.

13:34.033 --> 13:35.000
Okay.

13:35.033 --> 13:36.501
Kids, come on,

13:36.534 --> 13:37.767
wants
to see you.

13:37.801 --> 13:38.868
( <i>all cheer</i> )

13:38.901 --> 13:41.534
( <i>high voice:</i> )
Hi, kids.

13:42.968 --> 13:45.133
Yeah! I'm the Easter bunny

13:45.167 --> 13:50.033
and I've come all the way
from the enchanted lettuce patch

13:50.067 --> 13:52.667
just to spend
Easter with you.

13:52.701 --> 13:54.667
Now, you want to sing a song?

13:54.701 --> 13:55.667
Hmm?
KIDS:
Okay.

13:55.701 --> 13:56.934
Okay, now you join in.

13:56.968 --> 13:59.367
I think you'll know
this one, okay? All right.
Okay.

14:05.234 --> 14:07.167
* Hippity-hoppity, Easter... 

14:07.200 --> 14:12.000
Oh! And now, kids, in keeping
with the Easter season

14:12.033 --> 14:16.467
the Easter bunny has
a special surprise for you.

14:16.501 --> 14:18.534
He's going
to perform a scene

14:18.567 --> 14:22.033
from the Broadway play
 <i>Whose Life Is It Anyway?</i>

14:24.334 --> 14:26.133
That's right, kids.

14:26.167 --> 14:30.033
The Easter bunny
is also a serious artist, too.

14:30.067 --> 14:32.100
Now, you have to pretend

14:32.133 --> 14:36.567
that the Easter bunny's
paralyzed from the neck down.

14:39.167 --> 14:40.133
And he's
talking

14:40.167 --> 14:41.133
to his
doctor, okay?

14:41.167 --> 14:42.901
You got that, right?

14:42.934 --> 14:44.534
Good.

14:44.567 --> 14:48.868
( <i>dramatically</i> ):
Can't you see that
is why I've decided

14:48.901 --> 14:51.167
that life is not
worth living?

14:51.200 --> 14:53.334
I'm not human!

14:54.601 --> 14:56.467
And I'm even more
convinced of that

14:56.501 --> 14:58.300
by your visit than I was before.

14:58.334 --> 14:59.901
Now, how does that grab you?

14:59.934 --> 15:02.100
The very
exercise

15:02.133 --> 15:04.400
of your so-called
"professionalism"

15:04.434 --> 15:05.934
makes me want to die.

15:09.467 --> 15:11.634
She was so impressed
by my performance

15:11.667 --> 15:13.234
that she offered
me a part.

15:13.267 --> 15:14.234
Really?
Yeah.

15:14.267 --> 15:15.367
What part?

15:15.400 --> 15:17.901
The clown at her
daughter's birthday party.

15:17.934 --> 15:20.167
All right, Bob!

15:20.200 --> 15:22.534
Well, um... that leaves, uh...

15:22.567 --> 15:25.334
the guy in the yellow sweater.

15:28.601 --> 15:29.801
What'd you do?

15:29.834 --> 15:31.033
What'd you do?
What'd you do?
Come on.

15:31.067 --> 15:32.767
Well, I, uh...
I took a job

15:32.801 --> 15:35.567
as a night watchman
in an office building.

15:35.601 --> 15:36.767
A night watchman?

15:36.801 --> 15:38.601
ALEX:
I thought I would,
you know,

15:38.634 --> 15:40.167
have a lot of
time to myself--

15:40.200 --> 15:41.968
you know, catch up
on a lot of reading

15:42.000 --> 15:43.767
I always wanted
to get done.

15:43.801 --> 15:45.767
Well, the first
couple of weeks

15:45.801 --> 15:47.267
it was kind of boring.

15:47.300 --> 15:48.467
But after that

15:48.501 --> 15:50.467
I started to go
a little nuts.

Oh, what the hell,
let's make it an even number.

16:19.033 --> 16:21.567

16:24.534 --> 16:27.467
Oh, what else is left
on the agenda?

16:29.200 --> 16:31.234
And I had dinner...

16:31.267 --> 16:33.934
Oh, next is my rounds, make
sure the building is secure.

16:33.968 --> 16:36.767
My rounds, my rounds.

16:36.801 --> 16:39.934

19:01.767 --> 19:03.968
With one leg.

19:06.434 --> 19:09.534
Now, for my greatest trick,
ladies and gentlemen,

19:09.567 --> 19:11.501
I must have complete silence.

19:11.534 --> 19:14.601
I am going to juggle
and eat at the same time.

Oh, sure, sure,
I'm fine, Henry.

20:23.534 --> 20:26.267
Well, I'll just be
going along now.

20:27.534 --> 20:29.634
Yeah, just take it easy, Rieger.

It's just the first

But once you've been at

to learn to handle it.

Thanks for
the tip, Henry.

is a stinky, lousy job

and no future,

would anyone
like to help me
