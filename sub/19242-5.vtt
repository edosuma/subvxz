00:53.928 --> 00:57.182
PREVIOUSLY

00:57.766 --> 00:59.809
<i>I first met Ma-rin in the future.</i>

01:00.560 --> 01:04.147
<i>She was destined to die</i>
<i>on the same day and time I was.</i>

01:04.856 --> 01:08.151
<i>Did she have any clues about my death?</i>

01:08.526 --> 01:10.278
<i>Why I do keep seeing him around?</i>

01:10.361 --> 01:13.448
<i>So, I returned to the present</i>
<i>and found her.</i>

01:14.657 --> 01:17.202
<i>She would be in a car accident</i>
<i>in a few days.</i>

01:17.285 --> 01:21.539
<i>She would live out</i>
<i>the rest of her three years disabled.</i>

01:22.707 --> 01:26.878
<i>I felt bad for her, so just I saved her.</i>

01:29.005 --> 01:31.049
<i>I changed Song Ma-rin's future.</i>

01:32.342 --> 01:33.259
<i>But, then...</i>

01:35.762 --> 01:36.763
<i>What is this?</i>

01:37.514 --> 01:39.057
<i>How could I marry this woman?</i>

01:39.808 --> 01:40.850
Realtor?

01:41.142 --> 01:43.645
<i>My future had changed too.</i>

01:43.853 --> 01:45.855
You're home already?

01:45.939 --> 01:49.526
<i>It isn't 30 years or three years later.</i>
<i>It's three months later!</i>

01:51.611 --> 01:53.238
<i>Does this make any sense?</i>

01:53.446 --> 01:55.824
<i>There was never any marriage in my fate.</i>

01:55.907 --> 01:58.868
<i>What marriage? I wasn't even dating.</i>

01:58.952 --> 02:00.912
<i>So why did you save her to begin with?</i>

02:00.995 --> 02:02.747
<i>So I...</i>

02:02.831 --> 02:04.958
I would like it
if we didn't contact each other.

02:06.167 --> 02:07.836
Or run into each other.

02:08.753 --> 02:11.506
Let's end it here.

02:11.840 --> 02:14.008
What's your name?

02:14.968 --> 02:18.179
Now that I think about it,
I never asked you your name.

02:20.640 --> 02:23.810
Our goodbye is very intense
considering that.

02:24.727 --> 02:26.688
<i>Things are back to normal.</i>

02:27.021 --> 02:33.570
<i>Just like that, I returned my future</i>
<i>back to normal with no marriage in it.</i>

02:33.736 --> 02:34.571
<i>However...</i>

02:36.030 --> 02:38.616
<i>my future self said to me,</i>

02:38.700 --> 02:40.952
Hey, Yu So-joon. Yu So-joon!

02:41.327 --> 02:47.208
How about trying to make things work
with her?

02:47.709 --> 02:52.172
<i>Would my future-self regret</i>
<i>that I didn't marry her?</i>

02:52.922 --> 02:53.756
<i>Why?</i>

02:53.840 --> 02:55.091
I'm scared.

02:56.134 --> 02:57.260
Don't leave.

02:58.845 --> 03:00.180
You may not know this.

03:01.556 --> 03:03.892
I saved you from becoming disabled.

03:05.393 --> 03:06.352
Don't worry.

03:06.728 --> 03:08.479
-I...
-Please move.

03:11.983 --> 03:16.988
I... will save you.

03:17.697 --> 03:20.658
<i>I will save you.</i>

03:22.619 --> 03:26.789
<i>Then we should live together.</i>

03:27.790 --> 03:29.751
You should leave.

03:31.377 --> 03:32.212
What?

03:33.046 --> 03:35.089
I should not leave?

03:40.345 --> 03:41.429
Are we dating now?

03:45.767 --> 03:50.146
<i>All I want is...</i>
<i>someone who likes me the way I am,</i>

03:50.855 --> 03:54.442
<i>someone who is comfortable</i>
<i>and fun to be with.</i>

03:54.984 --> 03:56.277
<i>Stay by my side.</i>

03:57.028 --> 04:00.365
<i>So that I can protect you.</i>

04:01.032 --> 04:04.744
<i>Put your future in my hands.</i>

04:05.995 --> 04:11.626
<i>Just like that, I married a person</i>
<i>that was not originally fated to be.</i>

04:12.585 --> 04:13.628
<i>Ma-rin.</i>

04:14.629 --> 04:17.173
<i>How will our future change now?</i>

06:04.322 --> 06:05.448
What are you doing?

06:05.531 --> 06:07.367
What? What are you doing?

06:07.450 --> 06:09.452
Oh, my! What a surprise!

06:09.786 --> 06:12.121
Stop pretending to be surprised
and close the door.

06:12.246 --> 06:13.206
Okay.

06:14.165 --> 06:16.084
I told you to close the door.

06:16.167 --> 06:17.543
I'm closing it.

06:18.002 --> 06:19.128
Why are you coming in?

06:19.253 --> 06:21.381
What? Oh!

06:21.923 --> 06:23.633
You were telling me to get out.

06:26.135 --> 06:29.597
You're embarrassing me
first thing in the morning.

06:30.723 --> 06:33.893
You said to close the door,
so I thought you meant to come in.

06:34.060 --> 06:36.354
Haven't you become too bold
since we got married?

06:36.479 --> 06:37.605
You're like an old lady.

06:37.688 --> 06:39.399
No. Go wash up.

06:39.690 --> 06:41.609
I just mixed up the signals.

06:44.529 --> 06:46.739
Was that a signal?

06:48.032 --> 06:51.369
Are you sending me a signal right now?

06:53.579 --> 06:54.580
What do you mean?

06:55.581 --> 06:56.916
Ah, well...

06:57.959 --> 07:01.170
I'll use the one upstairs. You can use it.

07:04.173 --> 07:05.925
Wash yourself thoroughly.

07:06.634 --> 07:08.344
I'll make a yummy breakfast.

07:15.268 --> 07:16.394
This will be good!

07:16.811 --> 07:17.645
Enjoy your food.

07:20.523 --> 07:22.191
Let me try these vegetables first.

07:27.822 --> 07:28.865
Is it that good?

07:31.451 --> 07:34.245
You're too much!
I didn't put in that much effort.

07:34.579 --> 07:37.415
You don't have to get emotional over this.

07:38.708 --> 07:40.251
I think the food has gone bad.

07:40.960 --> 07:41.794
What?

07:49.135 --> 07:49.969
It's fine.

07:50.344 --> 07:52.013
No, don't eat it. It's bad.

07:52.263 --> 07:53.097
You'll get sick.

07:53.973 --> 07:55.516
There's no way it went bad.

07:56.350 --> 07:57.685
I went shopping this morning.

08:00.646 --> 08:02.064
I guess you just don't like it.

08:02.940 --> 08:04.734
Don't eat it. It's garbage.

08:04.817 --> 08:06.277
I didn't mean it that way.

08:06.360 --> 08:08.029
I had no idea you were picky.

08:09.071 --> 08:11.699
If it's not good,
that's all you need to say.

08:11.949 --> 08:13.576
Why treat food like garbage?

08:14.118 --> 08:16.370
You were the one who used
the word "garbage".

08:17.455 --> 08:20.458
This is our first morning together
after our honeymoon.

08:21.334 --> 08:24.420
It was a special morning for us,
but I ruined it.

08:28.174 --> 08:29.800
You're giving an exasperated sigh.

08:31.219 --> 08:34.889
Did something bad happen
that I don't know about?

08:38.768 --> 08:40.645
My expectations must have been too high.

08:47.610 --> 08:49.153
This could be a problem.

08:49.987 --> 08:52.406
Naive girls are difficult for me.

08:55.076 --> 08:57.245
Gosh, it was only a joke.

08:57.787 --> 09:00.957
This is so delicious. How could it be bad?

09:01.874 --> 09:03.668
Are you pretending to be this naive?

09:03.876 --> 09:06.003
Stop. It doesn't suit you.

09:07.672 --> 09:09.131
Forget it. I know how you think.

09:09.257 --> 09:10.758
It's up to you if you believe me.

09:10.967 --> 09:14.345
But I didn't marry you to cook for me.

09:14.679 --> 09:16.013
You don't need to do this.

09:20.268 --> 09:21.185
Wow.

09:22.353 --> 09:23.980
How did you create this taste?

09:24.730 --> 09:25.815
Just as I thought,

09:26.607 --> 09:28.192
you're no average woman.

09:30.695 --> 09:33.281
After you make breakfast,
you have to make lunch.

09:33.698 --> 09:36.325
Then comes dinner.
Do you know what the problem is?

09:37.535 --> 09:40.329
Once you wake up,
you have to make breakfast again.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.457
Your life will be wasted
cooking all the time.

09:43.874 --> 09:47.420
I don't want to make you Bap-soon again.

09:51.757 --> 09:53.926
I was being a little sensitive, right?

09:57.138 --> 10:00.266
We can just eat bread or something.

10:00.474 --> 10:02.852
We can hire help, too.

10:03.352 --> 10:05.563
"Ah, this is what luxury is.

10:06.689 --> 10:09.358
How can life be so easy?"

10:10.776 --> 10:12.278
That is what you need.

10:12.570 --> 10:13.654
From now on,

10:14.780 --> 10:16.741
live like Flower too, okay?

10:18.326 --> 10:19.660
Oh, no.

10:20.536 --> 10:22.038
Cooking is fun for me.

10:23.497 --> 10:24.999
It's my specialty and hobby.

10:29.712 --> 10:32.882
That's why it's so good.

10:32.965 --> 10:34.175
It's good, right?

10:34.300 --> 10:35.384
That explains it.

10:36.510 --> 10:38.262
Please give me more rice.

10:38.971 --> 10:39.972
You want more?

10:40.431 --> 10:42.558
I made lots of rice,
I knew you'd want more.

10:43.059 --> 10:44.060
Hold on a bit.

10:55.363 --> 10:56.197
Here.

10:57.823 --> 10:58.741
What is it?

10:59.200 --> 11:01.118
You'll have living expenses and so on.

11:01.202 --> 11:02.495
Use this for now.

11:06.332 --> 11:07.583
I feel very strange.

11:10.211 --> 11:11.379
Don't do this.

11:11.921 --> 11:13.589
You seem too much like a husband.

11:14.173 --> 11:15.966
Why? Just use it.

11:17.134 --> 11:19.136
Calculate and give me
the living expenses.

11:19.887 --> 11:23.099
-Just accept it.
-Later, let's do it slowly.

11:23.766 --> 11:26.060
I don't feel ready for it yet.

11:26.936 --> 11:30.022
Put it back.

11:30.106 --> 11:31.148
Let's go.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.402
Why are you coming out? Go in.

11:34.735 --> 11:36.946
It's your first day at work
since we got married.

11:37.029 --> 11:39.073
I've always wanted to do this.

11:39.615 --> 11:41.033
What a strange thing to want.

11:41.242 --> 11:42.159
I'll be going now.

11:44.745 --> 11:45.746
Honey!

11:48.541 --> 11:49.709
Have a nice day.

11:51.127 --> 11:52.086
My husband.

11:54.338 --> 11:55.589
Come home soon!

12:01.137 --> 12:02.346
Go inside.

12:15.860 --> 12:16.902
Kang Ki-doong.

12:17.528 --> 12:19.947
Do you know what time it is?
Why aren't you at work...

12:20.030 --> 12:23.743
-Oh, ramen!
-No! Don't come in here!

12:23.826 --> 12:26.412
You didn't get breakfast
on your first day as a newlywed?

12:26.495 --> 12:29.248
It's not right for a married man
to steal ramen.

12:29.331 --> 12:32.251
It's not that I didn't get fed.
I got fed food that was inedible.

12:32.334 --> 12:34.462
-Just give me a little.
-No.

12:34.545 --> 12:36.297
-My stomach feels sick.
-No way.

12:36.714 --> 12:38.382
You are so petty.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.050
You're putting on a show there.

12:41.260 --> 12:42.094
Hey.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.430
Did you just eat this?

12:44.555 --> 12:47.183
-Do you know what this is?
-You said what's yours is mine.

12:47.266 --> 12:49.351
This is so good.

12:49.435 --> 12:53.147
I brought this from the other world.
You have to wait a year for this.

12:53.731 --> 12:56.400
No wonder. It tasted unreal.

12:56.484 --> 12:58.068
Is this going to be a hit in 2017?

12:58.360 --> 13:02.114
In the future, this will make history
in Korean ramen.

13:02.823 --> 13:05.117
You should be honored to eat it now.

13:06.869 --> 13:08.329
I'm skipping work today.

13:08.412 --> 13:10.623
You'll need to work for me.

13:10.706 --> 13:14.752
Don't people become responsible
and accountable once they marry?

13:14.835 --> 13:15.795
Not at all.

13:16.212 --> 13:18.631
If the company fails,
I'll just do the lottery.

13:18.714 --> 13:21.801
Ma-rin needs to know
you're living in two houses.

13:22.218 --> 13:24.094
You might not know this.

13:24.178 --> 13:27.097
People don't change overnight
just because they get married.

13:27.556 --> 13:29.767
People need time alone...

13:29.850 --> 13:32.102
Just tell me.
What is it like to be married?

13:36.190 --> 13:39.443
It's bewildering.
Try it yourself if you're so curious.

13:39.527 --> 13:43.239
Are you crazy?
I don't want to be called an old man.

13:45.491 --> 13:47.326
Are you saying that I'm a crazy old man?

13:51.664 --> 13:54.375
Gosh, maybe I should send her
to a cooking class.

13:55.626 --> 13:58.754
How can I eat that
for the rest of my life?

13:58.838 --> 14:00.047
COOKING CLASS

14:00.297 --> 14:02.800
Flower, who has no palate.

14:04.385 --> 14:05.886
From my point of view,

14:06.679 --> 14:09.849
rather than Chairman Yu meeting
the daughter of an influential family,

14:10.057 --> 14:15.396
it's much better he is with Bap-soon
who has no influence or backing.

14:16.647 --> 14:19.650
That's just your point of view.
You only think of yourself.

14:22.695 --> 14:25.114
You should stay friendly with Bap-soon.

14:25.781 --> 14:29.743
Why don't you dig around
and find some information on Chairman Yu?

14:30.202 --> 14:31.912
What? Find out what?

14:31.996 --> 14:34.248
What is his family like?
Who are his connections?

14:34.331 --> 14:36.792
Who are his politics
and business connections?

14:36.876 --> 14:39.420
Honestly, I'm so curious about that.

14:39.503 --> 14:41.505
But nothing is known about him.

14:42.256 --> 14:43.549
He's a complete mystery.

14:44.216 --> 14:45.426
Why do you need to know?

14:45.509 --> 14:49.430
Gosh, if your husband says something,
can't you just...

14:50.931 --> 14:53.684
Can't you use this opportunity
to be a helpful wife?

14:55.519 --> 14:57.354
What do you take me for?

14:57.897 --> 14:59.440
I'm Lee Gun-sook.

14:59.565 --> 15:02.443
You expect the great Lee Gun-sook
to be some doting wife?

15:02.526 --> 15:06.280
You want me to go to Bap-soon
and kneel to her?

15:06.947 --> 15:09.700
-Never mind. I get it.
-Nev--

15:12.202 --> 15:15.247
I can barely contain my anger these days.

15:15.581 --> 15:20.628
So don't tell me to chase after Bap-soon,
or be a helpful wife.

15:21.378 --> 15:22.630
I'm sorry, Madam.

15:22.713 --> 15:25.299
I was unable to understand you, Madam.

15:25.382 --> 15:27.885
I'm truly sorry,
and I will be canceling the card.

15:27.968 --> 15:29.428
What? What did you say?

15:30.012 --> 15:32.806
If you think my words are a joke,
my money must be a joke too.

15:32.890 --> 15:34.099
So don't use it.

15:35.643 --> 15:37.102
Did I say you were a joke?

15:37.436 --> 15:38.812
Why are you being so petty?

15:38.896 --> 15:39.772
Petty?

15:40.189 --> 15:41.398
Did you just say petty?

15:41.565 --> 15:44.652
Life is petty. Don't you know that?

15:44.735 --> 15:47.738
I go around getting treated like crap
to protect you from that.

15:48.530 --> 15:50.616
I do everything you ask for.

15:50.908 --> 15:53.285
What was that?
Those German kitchen products.

15:53.577 --> 15:56.205
That weird chandelier is
not my style at all.

15:56.288 --> 15:57.414
And that's not all.

15:57.498 --> 15:59.917
Who are you envying in front of me?

16:00.250 --> 16:01.293
Are you crazy?

16:02.378 --> 16:03.796
I'm canceling that card today.

16:06.048 --> 16:06.882
Hey!

16:08.008 --> 16:08.926
Lee Gun-sook.

16:10.427 --> 16:12.805
Don't raise your voice
so early in the morning, okay?

16:13.430 --> 16:15.933
Let's start with a fresh morning, quietly.

16:16.266 --> 16:17.810
A fresh morning!

16:18.644 --> 16:19.478
Please!

16:24.400 --> 16:26.276
How could he do that to me?

16:27.111 --> 16:27.987
How could he?

16:45.462 --> 16:46.672
Reporting a marriage.

16:50.175 --> 16:51.427
I'll fill it out with him.

16:51.510 --> 16:52.720
MARRIAGE REPORT

16:59.184 --> 17:01.520
Miss?

17:03.355 --> 17:04.314
Your phone.

17:04.398 --> 17:05.274
Me?

17:06.233 --> 17:07.317
Isn't this yours, Miss?

17:07.401 --> 17:09.028
Oh, I almost lost it.

17:09.111 --> 17:10.362
Thank you.

17:10.863 --> 17:12.072
Yeah, So-ri.

17:13.615 --> 17:16.035
Me? I'm at the district hall.

17:17.244 --> 17:18.996
I came to report my marriage.

17:20.873 --> 17:21.790
Now?

17:23.208 --> 17:24.460
Sounds good.

17:25.252 --> 17:27.046
I'm on my way now. Okay.

17:30.132 --> 17:31.258
Earlier...

17:32.676 --> 17:35.804
You called me "Miss,"
So I didn't know you were talking to me.

17:37.806 --> 17:39.224
I'm married.

17:48.317 --> 17:51.153
Didn't we decide
to cast Gun-sook out of our lives?

17:52.154 --> 17:56.658
She came to the piano academy
and asked me to help her see you!

17:57.618 --> 17:59.620
I do have a weak heart.

17:59.703 --> 18:01.330
That shameless girl.

18:02.247 --> 18:03.624
I said I was sorry.

18:03.707 --> 18:05.292
It really wasn't anything.

18:05.375 --> 18:08.003
You hold grudges a long time.
Are you abusing your power?

18:10.422 --> 18:11.924
Here. They have nice clothes.

18:13.842 --> 18:16.345
Wait. Just hold it in.

18:16.678 --> 18:18.972
She is trying to make up with you.

18:20.808 --> 18:23.102
Don't try to transfer
your weak heart to me.

18:24.561 --> 18:26.313
Looks like I already have.

18:36.824 --> 18:38.867
This, this, and this.

18:39.451 --> 18:40.661
In large please.

18:40.744 --> 18:41.578
Okay.

18:43.539 --> 18:47.251
<i>Why don't you dig around</i>
<i>and find some information on Chairman Yu?</i>

18:47.751 --> 18:51.964
Don't you get confused by men's clothing?
I don't have a feel for them at all.

18:52.548 --> 18:53.924
You're not choosing anything?

18:55.676 --> 19:00.055
I feel like I'm being nosy,
telling him what to wear.

19:00.556 --> 19:03.100
You really have no idea
what you're talking about.

19:03.350 --> 19:05.811
It's not being nosy.
You're taking care of him.

19:06.186 --> 19:09.022
"You look better now that you're married."

19:09.189 --> 19:11.358
Shouldn't you make sure he hears that?

19:12.442 --> 19:14.153
You have no concept
of a helpful wife.

19:16.405 --> 19:17.489
A helpful wife?

19:17.906 --> 19:19.658
Yes, a helpful wife.

19:21.076 --> 19:22.911
You need to do that with ambition, too.

19:24.079 --> 19:25.080
Let's stop looking.

19:26.039 --> 19:26.874
Hey.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.168
Are you two going to be boring like this?

19:29.877 --> 19:32.588
If we go down one floor,
it's full of clothes for us.

19:33.255 --> 19:35.924
Mind your own lives! Will you?

19:37.050 --> 19:39.636
You wouldn't know how fun this is
unless you get married.

19:41.138 --> 19:44.099
What do you think of this?
I think it would suit your husband.

19:44.766 --> 19:45.851
What's his size?

19:48.478 --> 19:49.646
You don't know his size?

19:51.940 --> 19:53.817
Just the right body.

19:54.735 --> 19:59.072
A body that makes other men feel inferior.

20:00.449 --> 20:02.743
How could you not know
your husband's size?

20:02.910 --> 20:04.369
It's boring to know everything.

20:04.870 --> 20:05.954
I can just ask him.

20:07.956 --> 20:09.082
Yeah, ask him.

20:14.504 --> 20:17.466
<i>The person you called is not available.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

20:19.092 --> 20:19.968
Is he busy?

20:27.351 --> 20:30.729
That's the newest line. Fall/Winter 2017.

20:32.439 --> 20:35.567
Of course. I need to wear the newest line.

20:36.526 --> 20:38.612
You two must be all charm to each other.

20:39.071 --> 20:41.281
You don't know each other that well yet.

20:58.257 --> 20:59.091
Nice!

20:59.174 --> 21:01.009
You don't know his shoe size either?

21:02.010 --> 21:03.595
Just buy your stuff.

21:04.429 --> 21:07.224
Do you know anything about each other?
Are you not very close?

21:08.725 --> 21:10.936
Are you only close
if you know each other's size?

21:12.104 --> 21:16.149
Our relationship is not just physical
like yours is.

21:17.734 --> 21:18.610
<i>I think...</i>

21:19.945 --> 21:23.615
<i>I know everything</i>
<i>about who he is as a person.</i>

21:25.117 --> 21:27.953
<i>Even if he doesn't say anything,</i>
<i>I can see everything inside.</i>

21:28.912 --> 21:30.998
<i>We should feel as if we're one.</i>

21:32.332 --> 21:33.792
<i>Isn't that the important thing?</i>

21:34.960 --> 21:37.546
<i>Still, there are things you ought to know.</i>

21:37.629 --> 21:39.589
His background, and how he grew up.

21:40.757 --> 21:43.218
There are so many strange people
when you look into it.

21:44.678 --> 21:46.430
We don't have secrets from each other.

21:47.180 --> 21:49.266
We may have married fast.

21:49.725 --> 21:52.728
But I've decided to be with him forever,
as I trust him.

21:53.937 --> 21:57.524
Do you meet often
with your husband's friends?

21:59.318 --> 22:00.444
Do I have to?

22:00.819 --> 22:02.404
We each have our own private lives.

22:06.533 --> 22:07.367
Why?

22:08.452 --> 22:11.955
I married Yong-jin very quickly too.

22:12.039 --> 22:13.498
But I wasn't as bad as you.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.625
What private life?

22:15.709 --> 22:17.836
Private lives are meant to be shared.

22:18.754 --> 22:21.548
Anyway, it sure isn't normal.

22:21.923 --> 22:23.759
Right? Isn't that true?

22:25.218 --> 22:28.055
It does seem a bit odd.

22:39.441 --> 22:41.568
I really don't like any of your friends.

22:41.651 --> 22:43.487
My friends don't like you either.

22:44.154 --> 22:45.989
-Thank goodness.
-Thank goodness.

22:46.531 --> 22:48.033
How many eggs do we have left?

22:48.116 --> 22:49.201
-Two?
-Two?

22:49.326 --> 22:50.494
-Let's buy eggs.
-Okay.

22:50.660 --> 22:51.703
Here they are.

22:52.287 --> 22:54.998
What are they? These are baked eggs!

22:55.082 --> 22:55.999
You're right.

22:57.125 --> 22:57.959
Okay.

22:58.835 --> 22:59.669
Let's go.

23:14.810 --> 23:15.811
Yeah, Realtor.

23:16.228 --> 23:18.647
You called me 22 times.
Is something wrong?

23:19.398 --> 23:22.984
No, I just went to buy you clothes,
but I didn't know your size.

23:23.151 --> 23:24.945
<i>Why would you buy me clothes?</i>

23:25.737 --> 23:27.364
You don't have to say it like that.

23:27.906 --> 23:28.865
Hold on.

23:29.157 --> 23:31.493
Can I get some pork for seaweed soup?

23:31.576 --> 23:33.787
You're supposed to use beef
for seaweed soup.

23:35.080 --> 23:37.165
-Are you grocery shopping?
-<i>Yes.</i>

23:37.249 --> 23:38.667
Look forward to dinner tonight.

23:39.126 --> 23:41.503
Just give me pork. I want to test it out.

23:41.795 --> 23:42.671
<i>Yes, okay.</i>

23:42.754 --> 23:45.674
-I want to eat out with you today.
-<i>Eat out?</i>

23:46.550 --> 23:48.218
Don't buy anything, come right away.

23:48.718 --> 23:50.762
I'll text you the location,
come right away.

23:50.929 --> 23:52.639
Hey, Realtor.

23:56.309 --> 23:57.352
A date?

24:00.063 --> 24:01.356
I won't be testing it today.

24:03.942 --> 24:06.361
Bap-soon doesn't know much either.

24:07.112 --> 24:09.448
She doesn't know anything
about her husband.

24:09.531 --> 24:12.075
Do you think that makes any sense?

24:12.200 --> 24:13.201
I'm so tired.

24:13.702 --> 24:15.620
She knows, but is pretending not to.

24:16.371 --> 24:18.707
Do you think she's the type
to scheme like that?

24:19.166 --> 24:20.500
She is such a talker.

24:20.876 --> 24:21.877
Lee Gun-sook,

24:21.960 --> 24:26.882
do you think everyone is naive like you?

24:27.674 --> 24:28.967
Am I naive?

24:30.010 --> 24:33.346
Anyway, you're not canceling
my card, are you?

24:33.430 --> 24:34.473
I'll see.

24:34.556 --> 24:37.142
You could actually do something helpful.

24:38.393 --> 24:40.353
Keep a good relationship with Bap-soon.

24:40.437 --> 24:41.688
Don't cause any problems.

24:42.564 --> 24:46.234
Why are you and Bap-soon
like cats and dogs anyway?

24:47.486 --> 24:48.820
It's difficult to explain.

24:50.572 --> 24:52.699
Gun-sook wronged me.

24:53.325 --> 24:54.826
I did something harsh to her.

24:55.410 --> 24:57.871
Then Gun-sook wronged me again.

24:58.663 --> 25:00.123
That's how we ended up here.

25:01.166 --> 25:03.168
You understand
where I'm coming from, right?

25:04.294 --> 25:05.128
No.

25:05.795 --> 25:07.881
It's good that you made up, though.

25:08.215 --> 25:09.549
Regardless, she was a friend.

25:09.633 --> 25:11.468
But, seeing Gun-sook today,

25:12.219 --> 25:13.803
I felt a little sorry to you.

25:14.304 --> 25:15.138
For what?

25:15.889 --> 25:19.601
You're just Realtor to me,
but you're a chairman, after all.

25:20.644 --> 25:23.438
I wondered if I wasn't prepared.

25:25.440 --> 25:26.650
Tell me the truth.

25:27.025 --> 25:29.736
Would you like it
if I was an ambitious and dutiful wife?

25:29.903 --> 25:30.862
Like Gun-sook?

25:32.197 --> 25:34.950
I'm a chairman that plays all day.
What would you need to do?

25:35.742 --> 25:37.953
Don't do things like that.
It's burdensome.

25:38.620 --> 25:40.080
You play all day and earn money?

25:40.830 --> 25:43.583
Didn't you say you play hard
and work hard?

25:44.042 --> 25:45.085
In a totally sexy way?

25:45.835 --> 25:47.337
Ki-doong does all the work.

25:48.421 --> 25:49.422
I just play.

25:49.506 --> 25:51.841
In a totally sexy way.

25:51.925 --> 25:53.134
That's nonsense.

25:53.552 --> 25:56.721
Fighting over power, conspiracy, betrayal,
ambition, and all that.

25:56.888 --> 25:59.724
-You don't have any of that?
-There's none of that.

26:04.187 --> 26:05.146
What now?

26:05.230 --> 26:07.482
You're just saying that,
but you work hard, right?

26:07.857 --> 26:08.775
I can see it all.

26:12.028 --> 26:12.862
Sure,

26:13.488 --> 26:14.990
thanks for noticing.

26:19.494 --> 26:20.704
And one of these days,

26:21.705 --> 26:23.957
can't you introduce me to your friends?

26:24.833 --> 26:26.585
I'm okay with a housewarming.

26:27.002 --> 26:30.672
I've only briefly met
Ki-doong and Se-young.

26:31.089 --> 26:32.424
Introduce me to your friends.

26:33.300 --> 26:34.217
All right.

26:35.635 --> 26:36.636
Eat all you want.

26:37.387 --> 26:40.557
You need to know
how to cook pork properly.

26:41.391 --> 26:42.309
What are you saying?

26:49.065 --> 26:50.108
-Mister!
-Oh my.

26:50.942 --> 26:52.861
You almost caused a big accident!

26:53.737 --> 26:56.615
Be careful if you're carrying around
that dangerous thing.

26:56.698 --> 26:58.033
-I'm sorry.
-Are you okay?

26:59.242 --> 27:00.118
Gosh!

27:00.827 --> 27:03.622
Imagine if that dangerous thing
had fallen on my wife.

27:03.705 --> 27:04.914
What would you have done?

27:05.915 --> 27:07.500
-I'm sorry.
-Be careful!

27:07.584 --> 27:09.002
It's really dangerous.

27:10.086 --> 27:13.173
Honey, are you okay? You're not hurt?

27:13.256 --> 27:15.050
It was just a little scary. I'm okay.

27:15.133 --> 27:16.176
What a relief.

27:18.261 --> 27:21.181
My heart dropped.
You're really not hurt?

27:21.681 --> 27:23.391
A little scared. I'm all right.

27:23.475 --> 27:27.228
I was so scared for you.

27:27.729 --> 27:29.147
We're ready to pay.

27:29.230 --> 27:30.482
Ma-rin! No.

27:30.565 --> 27:32.901
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I am.

27:34.319 --> 27:35.612
I said I would pay.

27:35.695 --> 27:38.323
No, it's not even much.
I'll buy it for you.

27:39.074 --> 27:39.949
Thank you.

27:40.283 --> 27:41.159
Thank you.

27:43.286 --> 27:45.121
You should just use my card.

27:45.205 --> 27:48.458
Aren't you dividing up yours and mine
too much? It's awkward.

27:49.376 --> 27:51.044
I'm going to start working again.

27:52.212 --> 27:55.674
If I start thinking what's yours
is all mine, I'll lose my drive.

28:01.054 --> 28:06.476
Until I start working again,
yours is yours and mine is mine, okay?

28:08.395 --> 28:09.688
I'm really cool, right?

28:10.105 --> 28:11.606
I don't know about cool.

28:11.690 --> 28:13.233
You're just being stubborn.

28:14.359 --> 28:16.986
You were really startled
in the restaurant.

28:17.070 --> 28:18.154
You got really angry.

28:19.072 --> 28:21.741
Angry? What do you mean angry?

28:22.158 --> 28:23.952
You got so pissed and mad at that guy.

28:24.869 --> 28:26.329
You were like my protector.

28:26.496 --> 28:30.500
That was just my reflex.

28:31.668 --> 28:34.838
Is it just your instinct
to want to protect me?

28:35.922 --> 28:38.425
I suppose there must be a man's blood
flowing in here.

28:40.468 --> 28:41.594
You smell like a man.

28:41.678 --> 28:46.933
You like to jump to conclusions freely
whenever you want to, Ma-rin.

28:47.434 --> 28:48.893
What? I know you like it.

28:51.187 --> 28:52.897
Should we buy some fruit over there?

28:53.022 --> 28:54.482
We have fruit at home.

28:57.068 --> 28:58.153
It's amazing.

28:58.987 --> 28:59.946
What?

29:00.321 --> 29:03.700
I said we should buy fruit,
and you said we have some at home.

29:04.409 --> 29:06.494
We really do seem married, right?

29:09.414 --> 29:10.707
You smell like a husband.

29:10.790 --> 29:12.125
I smell like meat.

29:13.960 --> 29:15.170
Which fruit do you want?

29:15.920 --> 29:16.838
Guava?

29:17.756 --> 29:18.673
Guava.

29:23.052 --> 29:25.597
If the peel breaks in the middle,
you grant me a wish.

29:26.014 --> 29:27.015
You promised.

29:27.432 --> 29:29.267
So, what is your wish?

29:30.852 --> 29:32.228
My name on your phone...

29:33.229 --> 29:35.190
Instead of boring Song Ma-rin,

29:36.024 --> 29:37.317
save it as Flower.

29:40.028 --> 29:41.821
I'll peel this in one piece to the end.

29:42.447 --> 29:44.282
What is that? It's so childish.

29:45.950 --> 29:48.578
I want to be childish. What can I do?

29:50.663 --> 29:51.498
Husband.

29:53.208 --> 29:55.293
You say that so easily.

29:58.505 --> 30:02.509
My mom and dad got married
because my mom got pregnant with me.

30:04.886 --> 30:06.221
I kind of knew it.

30:06.805 --> 30:08.431
You were born when she was 20.

30:10.391 --> 30:13.228
Two kids got married because of me.

30:16.523 --> 30:19.442
My dad ran off
when I was in the second grade.

30:19.984 --> 30:21.778
I don't even remember his face.

30:24.489 --> 30:25.406
Anyway...

30:27.200 --> 30:31.079
my parents were always just Mom and Dad.

30:32.664 --> 30:33.832
What do you mean by that?

30:35.708 --> 30:36.835
What does that mean?

30:39.170 --> 30:40.797
In my memories...

30:42.173 --> 30:44.592
"This is a man and a woman
who love each other."

30:45.593 --> 30:47.720
"This is a husband and wife
who are happy."

30:48.596 --> 30:49.889
They never looked that way.

30:51.933 --> 30:55.186
It looked like
they lived together because of me.

30:57.480 --> 30:59.649
I was aware of that even at a young age.

31:01.109 --> 31:04.237
Whenever they fought,
I wondered if it was because of me.

31:05.697 --> 31:08.992
When my mom cried alone,
I wondered if it was because of me.

31:10.535 --> 31:14.163
When we would eat together awkwardly,
I wondered if it was because of me.

31:14.622 --> 31:16.291
"Was it because of me?", I thought.

31:19.002 --> 31:21.462
I guess you've been overreacting
since you were young.

31:22.171 --> 31:25.174
They must have raised you together
because they loved each other.

31:29.470 --> 31:30.847
Am I a woman to you?

31:34.601 --> 31:35.476
Yes.

31:36.769 --> 31:39.939
Promise me that you'll let me
live as a woman forever.

31:45.028 --> 31:45.904
Okay.

31:48.031 --> 31:50.867
Do you know how much effort I put in
to live well with you?

31:51.743 --> 31:53.202
Before we got married,

31:53.369 --> 31:55.538
I even took pre-marriage classes.

31:56.164 --> 31:58.041
Come on. You're lying.

31:58.374 --> 31:59.375
It's true.

32:00.376 --> 32:01.336
Let me see.

32:05.006 --> 32:07.508
I got this book in the class.

32:09.218 --> 32:11.554
This part made a deep impression on me.

32:12.013 --> 32:12.931
Listen up.

32:13.806 --> 32:16.851
"Don't point out what your partner did,
but express yourself.

32:17.518 --> 32:20.104
Instead of saying, "Why were you so late?"

32:20.563 --> 32:23.149
"I was so apprehensive.

32:23.316 --> 32:28.821
Because you didn't tell me
you were going to be late."

32:28.905 --> 32:30.114
What is that?

32:31.240 --> 32:33.076
This is what we're supposed to do.

32:33.159 --> 32:34.327
That is so boring.

32:34.410 --> 32:36.871
-Why?
-It's so old.

32:36.955 --> 32:39.374
-Putting the apple down is not allowed.
-Okay.

32:39.457 --> 32:40.291
There's more.

32:41.084 --> 32:43.127
It's not like we're reading a book.

32:43.211 --> 32:44.879
I'm reading a book.

32:46.130 --> 32:48.007
Don't laugh. I'm serious.

32:48.091 --> 32:49.008
Okay.

32:49.592 --> 32:51.010
This is the second one.

32:52.303 --> 32:54.931
"Before you criticize,
try to understand your partner."

32:55.390 --> 32:59.477
This is one of the four things you need
to remember to communicate.

32:59.560 --> 33:00.436
Your partner--

33:08.319 --> 33:09.445
Let's go to the bedroom.

33:11.072 --> 33:13.449
Why so sudden? I'm reading.

33:13.866 --> 33:16.786
Since when do you learn about life
from books?

33:19.914 --> 33:20.915
Then seduce me.

33:27.422 --> 33:29.007
Never mind. That's enough.

33:39.183 --> 33:41.394
People say marriage is crazy,

33:41.978 --> 33:43.813
and it's the grave-site of life.

33:45.273 --> 33:47.025
Why do people say depressing things?

33:47.692 --> 33:50.445
How come no one told us
it's this much fun?

33:53.072 --> 33:54.699
They wanted it all for themselves.

33:58.036 --> 33:58.870
Realtor.

33:59.579 --> 34:00.413
Yeah?

34:01.247 --> 34:02.457
I'm happy.

34:05.585 --> 34:06.461
Me too.

34:18.389 --> 34:19.223
Ma-rin.

34:19.432 --> 34:20.266
Yeah?

34:20.933 --> 34:22.018
My arm is numb.

34:26.022 --> 34:27.023
Okay.

34:28.024 --> 34:29.317
I'll do it.

34:30.193 --> 34:31.110
You do it.

34:31.736 --> 34:32.737
It's comfortable.

34:33.613 --> 34:34.781
-It's comfortable?
-Yes.

34:34.947 --> 34:36.032
I'll do it forever.

34:36.115 --> 34:37.658
-Really?
-Arm pillow.

34:42.371 --> 34:43.956
When I see you up close,

34:44.791 --> 34:46.667
you're the prettiest woman
in the world.

34:47.043 --> 34:48.336
How about from afar?

34:50.379 --> 34:51.506
You look like Bap-soon.

35:02.558 --> 35:05.561
A MASTER TALKS ABOUT
PROFITABLE REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT

35:18.533 --> 35:20.743
It bothers me.

35:20.827 --> 35:26.082
That day at Director Kim's house,
I was going on about Bap-soon.

35:26.165 --> 35:28.501
I was almost matched up
with Bap-soon back then.

35:28.960 --> 35:31.003
Chairman sure is something.

35:31.087 --> 35:32.505
Why Bap-soon, of all people?

35:33.631 --> 35:35.049
We shouldn't laugh.

35:35.133 --> 35:37.885
I was like Bap-soon, Bap-soon that day.

35:37.969 --> 35:40.555
From Chairman Yu’s point of view--
Chairman!

35:41.013 --> 35:44.016
Why gossip so loudly
where everyone can hear you?

35:44.100 --> 35:45.226
How unprofessional.

35:45.434 --> 35:47.603
We weren't gossiping...

35:47.687 --> 35:49.147
I heard it all.

35:50.022 --> 35:51.941
Secretary Hwang, why did you say--

35:52.024 --> 35:53.192
Enough.

35:54.110 --> 35:54.944
Yes.

36:02.076 --> 36:03.703
-Why don't you get off?
-Yes.

36:15.882 --> 36:17.592
Let me make a request.

36:18.259 --> 36:19.427
Yes, Chairman.

36:19.969 --> 36:22.972
From now on, all of our company employees

36:23.681 --> 36:26.434
shoudn't ever say "Bap."

36:26.517 --> 36:27.393
Yes.

36:27.476 --> 36:30.605
Instead of saying, "Let's go eat Bap,"
say, "Let's go for a meal."

36:30.688 --> 36:33.357
Don't say, "I'll buy Bap",
say, "I'll treat you to a meal."

36:33.482 --> 36:36.861
There are many things
that can replace that word.

36:36.944 --> 36:40.656
So, you're saying you would like us
to stop using that word altogether?

36:40.740 --> 36:45.077
Yes, that word is banned at Myreits.

36:45.536 --> 36:47.997
People can curse,
but they cannot say that word.

36:49.957 --> 36:52.460
"The chairman is being so annoying,
but what can you do?

36:52.543 --> 36:53.878
Play along."

36:53.961 --> 36:56.923
Spread the word, would you?

36:57.006 --> 36:59.759
It's not as if
I can put up an official announcement.

36:59.884 --> 37:03.137
-I can't say it myself.
-Your pride would go down,

37:03.221 --> 37:04.680
and I could go down too.

37:04.764 --> 37:08.809
It doesn't look good. Does it make sense
to tell people not to use the word Bap?

37:10.645 --> 37:13.814
Don't use reason,
but your emotions in this matter.

37:13.898 --> 37:15.066
Yes, emotions.

37:15.149 --> 37:17.777
I think this is something you can do
on a humane level.

37:17.860 --> 37:18.903
-Yes.
-Right?

37:18.986 --> 37:20.029
I'll keep that in mind.

37:21.530 --> 37:23.532
There's a lot of fine dust
in the air today.

37:23.616 --> 37:26.327
You're right. The weather is nice, though.

37:26.452 --> 37:28.412
All right. Have a great day today.

37:28.663 --> 37:29.830
Go.

37:32.166 --> 37:33.334
It's good I bought it.

37:33.417 --> 37:34.252
Try this.

37:34.335 --> 37:35.628
How can I eat what you made?

37:35.711 --> 37:36.545
Oh my.

37:37.046 --> 37:39.548
You know it's amazing that I cook well.

37:39.632 --> 37:41.550
You're just looking down on your mom.

37:42.176 --> 37:44.720
You better not do that
in front of So-joon.

37:45.137 --> 37:46.722
Don't get too excited with him.

37:46.931 --> 37:48.224
He'll feel burdened by you.

37:48.432 --> 37:52.645
Other daughters bring
their husbands around to their moms,

37:53.104 --> 37:55.940
making them bow to their wooden posts
at their in-laws.

37:56.691 --> 37:57.900
That's ridiculous.

37:58.150 --> 37:59.402
Where is this wooden post?

37:59.652 --> 38:01.320
I've never even seen one.

38:01.487 --> 38:04.448
I've seen someone
bowing at something similar to one.

38:05.950 --> 38:07.618
I can't talk to you.

38:08.703 --> 38:10.121
You sure are a show-off.

38:10.371 --> 38:13.124
Did you find out the memorial day
of So-joon's parents?

38:15.251 --> 38:16.961
He doesn't like talking about them.

38:17.795 --> 38:19.380
He'll tell me when the time comes.

38:19.547 --> 38:22.591
You show off, but you're immature.

38:24.427 --> 38:27.555
You're that household's daughter-in-law,
you should know that.

38:27.680 --> 38:31.517
If you're happy with having no in-laws,
you're really thoughtless.

38:32.101 --> 38:34.103
Having a big family can be a pain,

38:34.186 --> 38:36.689
but having no family can be lonely, too.

38:37.273 --> 38:38.774
I know that.

38:38.983 --> 38:39.817
Oh, my!

38:39.942 --> 38:43.237
It's hard to bring it up
because he might get hurt.

38:44.363 --> 38:46.657
Why do you keep digging around?

38:46.741 --> 38:49.493
Close the door if you're done.
You're wasting electricity.

38:49.577 --> 38:50.453
That hurts!

38:51.370 --> 38:55.583
I just wanted to make some food,
but you have nothing at all.

38:55.666 --> 38:59.337
Shouldn't rich people's fridge
be full of abalone, sea bream and stuff?

38:59.420 --> 39:02.214
-I don't have those. Eat ramen.
-What's down here?

39:02.298 --> 39:03.132
Ramen?

39:03.257 --> 39:06.135
-Hold on. I saw some here.
-I'm hungry.

39:06.218 --> 39:07.595
Wait, Mom.

39:10.681 --> 39:11.974
Oh, this is a pretty plate.

39:12.350 --> 39:13.976
What is this?

39:15.227 --> 39:16.354
I've never seen this.

39:17.396 --> 39:18.689
The packaging is strange.

39:18.856 --> 39:20.358
Hold on, Mom.

40:08.364 --> 40:11.575
<i>I'm a newlywed</i>
<i>who is new at being a housewife.</i>

40:11.659 --> 40:12.952
<i>Hello to the members.</i>

40:14.036 --> 40:17.248
<i>I had lunch,</i>
<i>and now I'm resting with a cup of coffee.</i>

40:18.916 --> 40:20.334
<i>To all my seniors...</i>

40:20.918 --> 40:23.796
<i>have you tried Ohri Ramen?</i>

40:25.381 --> 40:28.426
<i>If you haven't tried it, you must.</i>

40:29.385 --> 40:34.223
<i>"These days, you can't beat competition</i>
<i>by just causing a little commotion.</i>

40:35.224 --> 40:40.020
<i>Ah, even ramen needs to be</i>
<i>of the best quality.</i>

40:41.021 --> 40:43.065
<i>The world is not an easy place."</i>

40:43.232 --> 40:46.986
<i>It's a ramen that made me</i>
<i>come to this realization.</i>

40:48.195 --> 40:52.741
<i>it's such a relief that I have someone</i>
<i>on my side in this fierce world.</i>

40:54.326 --> 40:58.914
<i>Today's snack is Ohri Ramen</i>
<i>with my loving husband.</i>

41:00.624 --> 41:03.085
What? He told you not to use the word Bap?

41:03.169 --> 41:06.839
Yes. He said it's now banned
from our company.

41:06.922 --> 41:08.507
What a freaking joke.

41:08.591 --> 41:09.717
What is this?

41:09.800 --> 41:13.929
We can avoid using the word
for food that we eat.

41:15.431 --> 41:18.809
-What if we need "Bap" for other words?
-Jeez

41:19.852 --> 41:24.648
And what about this? This lint?
What should I call it?

41:25.107 --> 41:28.569
What about Cowboy Bebop or Spongebob?

41:28.652 --> 41:33.449
Should we just say
Cowboy be... and Sponge...?

41:34.366 --> 41:37.036
What about Indian Bap?
It's so delicious with milk.

41:38.287 --> 41:39.455
This is a problem.

41:39.997 --> 41:42.583
-Doobie doo bop. Doobie doo bop.
-Stop it.

41:44.877 --> 41:45.961
Gosh.

41:47.588 --> 41:48.881
I thought of one more.

41:49.381 --> 41:50.674
This one is really big.

41:52.593 --> 41:55.012
-Bap bap Di bap...
-Enough!

41:55.095 --> 41:57.014
-Bap...
-Stop! Get out.

41:57.097 --> 41:59.099
-You're noisy.
-It's your generation's song.

41:59.558 --> 42:02.311
Stop doing that stuff.

42:02.561 --> 42:04.104
What's going on?

42:04.396 --> 42:07.358
Are you two fighting?
Should I come back later?

42:08.234 --> 42:09.610
You're here, Director Wang.

42:09.693 --> 42:10.986
Yes.

42:11.070 --> 42:13.948
Director Wang, he isn't even at the level
to fight with me.

42:14.031 --> 42:14.907
Okay.

42:14.990 --> 42:17.034
Hey, is the chairman okay?

42:19.286 --> 42:20.329
I'm glad you're here.

42:21.872 --> 42:23.874
I heard you got in trouble
with the chairman.

42:23.958 --> 42:25.209
Grow up, would you?

42:25.292 --> 42:27.086
What is with the air in this company?

42:27.169 --> 42:28.712
I may have gotten in trouble,

42:28.796 --> 42:31.632
but you got totally stomped on, Yong-jin.

42:31.715 --> 42:32.633
What do you mean?

42:32.967 --> 42:35.803
The chairman withdrew the Sobeol district
a long time ago.

42:35.886 --> 42:37.721
-Why are you still pushing that?
-What?

42:37.805 --> 42:39.181
-Sobeol?
-Yes.

42:39.390 --> 42:40.683
What are you talking about?

42:41.058 --> 42:42.851
You said that in the presentation...

42:42.935 --> 42:44.061
Wait, Sobeol!

42:44.144 --> 42:47.189
-What are you saying?
-The chairman said no!

42:47.356 --> 42:48.649
What is going on here!

42:50.609 --> 42:52.653
I'll just ask you straightforward.

42:52.861 --> 42:55.406
You're always rejecting my projects.

42:55.489 --> 42:57.866
Is there some other reason why?

42:59.535 --> 43:01.036
I don't think we'll make money.

43:01.745 --> 43:06.083
To be more precise,
it's obvious to me that we'll lose money.

43:06.208 --> 43:07.459
That's why I'm objecting.

43:08.085 --> 43:10.254
And LE's headquarters?
It's guaranteed to move!

43:10.337 --> 43:12.840
Almost guaranteed, but not sure.

43:12.923 --> 43:15.926
There will be a group of apartments
near the Sobeol district.

43:16.010 --> 43:17.177
How do you analyze that?

43:18.679 --> 43:19.888
Can you guarantee that?

43:19.972 --> 43:21.932
Have you been to the future?

43:22.016 --> 43:23.559
Chairman?

43:23.934 --> 43:25.519
I know how skilled you are.

43:25.603 --> 43:30.733
I admit you have great foresight.
Still, you can't see the future.

43:30.816 --> 43:32.026
Calm down, Director.

43:32.901 --> 43:35.779
I'm sorry, Chairman.
It's not your place, Manager Kang.

43:35.863 --> 43:38.157
-Why are you screaming?
-Seriously?

43:38.240 --> 43:40.242
You will thank me in the future.

43:40.451 --> 43:43.245
You will, and the investors will too.

43:45.456 --> 43:47.416
Chairman Yu?

43:47.499 --> 43:49.793
-Here he is.
-Who are you?

43:52.254 --> 43:55.841
-I don't have my business card...
-He's an important guest,

43:55.966 --> 43:59.094
so I'll talk to you later.

43:59.303 --> 44:02.264
-Let's go outside.
-Go where? I just got here.

44:02.348 --> 44:04.975
-Can I get a coffee?
-I will buy you one.

44:05.934 --> 44:06.769
Hurry, hurry.

44:09.104 --> 44:11.649
-Why is that man glaring at me?
-It's just his eyes.

44:13.108 --> 44:13.942
How old is he?

44:14.026 --> 44:16.528
What manners are these,
in the middle of a conversation?

44:16.612 --> 44:18.322
You should leave if you're done.

44:18.405 --> 44:19.239
Hey!

44:20.866 --> 44:22.785
Leaving? Where to?

44:23.410 --> 44:25.913
Somewhere abroad
where they have nice beaches.

44:26.789 --> 44:29.041
It's time for me to take a break.

44:30.167 --> 44:32.503
Wow, how shameful of you
to leave me alone.

44:33.671 --> 44:35.756
You must feel at ease all by yourself.

44:35.839 --> 44:36.674
Yes.

44:36.799 --> 44:40.052
I don't even know what will happen to me.

44:40.427 --> 44:42.513
Then go now and find out.

44:43.263 --> 44:46.100
How can I go now, in this state?

44:46.433 --> 44:48.727
My life is going through a sudden change.

44:49.144 --> 44:53.774
I'm not in the state of mind
to go to the future to see things.

44:54.483 --> 44:56.610
Am I someone that leads such a busy life?

44:57.111 --> 44:59.196
Then am I someone
that leads such a busy life?

44:59.697 --> 45:01.740
I don't know. I need a break.

45:02.408 --> 45:04.243
You can hang out with me.

45:04.326 --> 45:06.078
I'll hang with you, Mister.

45:06.161 --> 45:07.955
We can eat cold noodles in the winter.

45:08.038 --> 45:09.373
I'll make it fun.

45:09.456 --> 45:12.876
I want to see women in bikinis.

45:12.960 --> 45:14.712
There are lots in Korea.

45:14.795 --> 45:15.629
There aren't any.

45:16.463 --> 45:17.756
You know about rash guards?

45:17.923 --> 45:20.050
They ruined all the beaches in Korea.

45:20.592 --> 45:23.887
Why would you wear an undershirt
at a beach? It's not right.

45:24.179 --> 45:26.473
-Jeez.
-Koreans just aren't bold.

45:26.682 --> 45:28.726
You are so cheap...

45:30.352 --> 45:34.565
What will I do
if I have an emergency in my life?

45:35.190 --> 45:37.985
You know you're the only one
who can help me.

45:38.527 --> 45:41.905
Do you lose all loyalty and feelings
once you get older?

45:41.989 --> 45:42.865
I don't know.

45:42.948 --> 45:44.950
Why are you so clingy and burdensome?

45:45.325 --> 45:46.535
Don't stick to me.

45:46.660 --> 45:51.373
I'll come back sexy after tanning myself
super dark front and back.

45:52.040 --> 45:53.667
I'll be going. Good luck.

45:53.834 --> 45:55.878
How much more of a tan do you need?

45:56.420 --> 45:57.463
Bye!

45:58.046 --> 46:00.799
If you get any more tan,
you're going to look really bad.

46:04.887 --> 46:06.096
Gosh.

46:10.934 --> 46:12.770
I'm at work now. I'll call back...

46:12.853 --> 46:14.772
<i>You just left. How can you be at work?</i>

46:15.856 --> 46:16.732
What?

46:16.815 --> 46:18.609
You're acting weird today.

46:19.026 --> 46:21.361
You showed up suddenly
and left acting weird.

46:22.237 --> 46:23.071
<i>I did?</i>

46:23.906 --> 46:26.617
You were acting like a different person.

46:27.701 --> 46:30.287
<i>-I was wondering if something's wrong.</i>
-What do you mean?

46:32.956 --> 46:34.625
You came home already?

46:37.044 --> 46:38.086
Do it.

46:40.756 --> 46:41.673
<i>Hello?</i>

46:41.757 --> 46:42.674
Chairman.

46:43.592 --> 46:44.551
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

46:44.635 --> 46:48.889
So, I was home, right?

46:49.348 --> 46:52.142
Yeah, you came home
while I was in the shower.

46:54.895 --> 46:58.899
Right, well… I'll call you later.

46:59.066 --> 47:00.442
<i>Wait, Realtor.</i>

47:01.485 --> 47:03.821
<i>Can I ask you about something?</i>

47:05.656 --> 47:07.157
You know that Ohri Ramen.

47:07.407 --> 47:08.867
The one in the strange package.

47:10.244 --> 47:11.161
<i>You don't know it?</i>

47:11.537 --> 47:13.247
<i>They were  in the kitchen cabinet.</i>

47:13.747 --> 47:14.957
<i>Where did you buy it?</i>

47:15.123 --> 47:16.708
That? Why?

47:18.377 --> 47:21.547
It was so good
that I posted it on the Mom Café.

47:22.005 --> 47:23.882
I even took nice pictures.

47:24.424 --> 47:27.386
But people commented
that there's no such ramen.

47:27.469 --> 47:28.720
Mom Café?

47:28.804 --> 47:30.848
You're not even a mom. Why did you that?

47:33.141 --> 47:34.101
Never mind,

47:34.560 --> 47:36.061
I'll search online.

47:36.144 --> 47:37.938
No, no.

47:38.021 --> 47:39.314
The truth is...

47:41.024 --> 47:44.695
My friend is a researcher
at a ramen company.

47:45.195 --> 47:48.615
You can't put that up on the internet,
or anything.

47:48.699 --> 47:50.409
He gave it to me to try out.

47:50.492 --> 47:51.827
It's not on sale yet.

47:52.744 --> 47:54.955
You need to delete that now.

47:55.038 --> 47:57.875
It could cause trouble.
The company's fate is resting on that.

47:59.293 --> 48:00.419
What do I do?

48:01.420 --> 48:03.380
Did I leak a company's secrets?

48:03.964 --> 48:05.591
Am I a corporate spy now?

48:05.674 --> 48:07.467
<i>Just delete it quickly.</i>

48:08.218 --> 48:12.014
It's just that the package looked like
other ramen packages on the market.

48:13.307 --> 48:14.433
I just deleted it.

48:15.183 --> 48:17.936
But, it had 1,200 views.

48:18.020 --> 48:19.146
Will that be okay?

48:20.564 --> 48:22.649
I'm already so tired.

48:23.400 --> 48:24.693
Oh, Ma-rin.

48:25.569 --> 48:27.946
I have another incoming call.
Talk to you later.

48:28.030 --> 48:29.197
I'm sorry, Realtor.

48:29.781 --> 48:30.782
Realtor.

48:33.243 --> 48:34.286
He hung up.

48:35.495 --> 48:36.371
What do I do?

48:40.083 --> 48:42.002
Things don't quite make sense though.

48:54.264 --> 48:55.182
What's this?

48:56.016 --> 48:56.850
A bag?

49:05.651 --> 49:07.861
He buys clothes on his own just fine.

49:11.573 --> 49:14.368
What is this strange feeling that I have?

49:17.621 --> 49:19.164
<i>There's So-joon's wife.</i>

49:20.540 --> 49:21.750
She's not qualified.

49:22.501 --> 49:26.213
It's not up to me,
but it'd be better to find someone else.

49:26.838 --> 49:28.757
Still, Chairman Oh is recommending her.

49:28.840 --> 49:29.716
He isn't.

49:30.092 --> 49:31.301
He's just pushing her in.

49:31.385 --> 49:34.304
We have a photographer in our family.

49:34.388 --> 49:36.223
Why would we find someone else?

49:36.682 --> 49:39.101
The PR manager is okay with it.

49:39.184 --> 49:40.519
Yes, I am.

49:40.978 --> 49:43.146
You see? He's fine with it.

49:43.230 --> 49:45.357
How is Song Ma-rin our family?

49:45.774 --> 49:46.608
What?

49:47.442 --> 49:49.778
Let's discuss
the site selection of the library.

49:51.863 --> 49:53.115
My goodness.

49:54.116 --> 49:56.076
The Library of Love site will be...

49:56.660 --> 49:58.078
<i>Happiness.</i>

49:59.579 --> 50:02.791
No one takes part in it anymore
since your parents passed.

50:03.667 --> 50:06.962
I want to develop an NGO
that builds houses.

50:07.546 --> 50:08.839
I think it was on Monday.

50:08.922 --> 50:10.257
I spoke to your dad.

50:10.340 --> 50:11.216
My dad?

50:11.633 --> 50:13.885
He said he would think about it.

50:15.429 --> 50:17.597
Isn't it better than retiring
and doing nothing?

50:18.432 --> 50:19.641
I think he will do it.

50:19.725 --> 50:21.268
He wanted to do it before, anyway.

50:21.351 --> 50:22.936
I guess that's true.

50:25.814 --> 50:27.899
You want to carry out
your parents' dreams.

50:29.151 --> 50:30.402
You build the homes,

50:30.569 --> 50:33.071
your dad runs the operations,
and I provide the money.

50:33.655 --> 50:35.532
Wow. Aren't I cool?

50:36.158 --> 50:37.200
I have a good feeling.

50:37.284 --> 50:39.411
I understand what you're saying.

50:39.786 --> 50:42.706
But how can I do an NGO?
I never had any interest in that.

50:42.789 --> 50:44.458
How can I do that?

50:44.541 --> 50:45.500
Se-young.

50:46.334 --> 50:47.586
You are so talented.

50:47.669 --> 50:49.921
Who else would I work with if not you?

50:54.176 --> 50:56.845
If we do a cheers,
that means you will do it.

50:59.514 --> 51:04.061
Hey, how can you try to change
my life with just a beer?

51:04.144 --> 51:05.771
Come on, Se-young.

51:08.440 --> 51:09.649
Oh jeez.

51:09.816 --> 51:11.485
Okay. Cheers.

51:13.320 --> 51:15.238
You're the best.

51:19.242 --> 51:21.870
Don't let just anyone in here, okay?

51:22.412 --> 51:23.288
What?

51:23.705 --> 51:26.958
We will select the site
once we take a look at our site.

51:27.292 --> 51:28.251
What's next?

51:31.379 --> 51:33.006
You know you can't back out, right?

51:33.924 --> 51:36.635
Once you sign that,
you can't back out of this.

51:37.302 --> 51:40.472
Unless a judge gets involved,
we can't split up.

51:52.150 --> 51:54.945
If you're not up for it,
should we do it later?

51:55.445 --> 51:57.739
Everyone does it a few years later.
Give it to me.

51:58.323 --> 52:00.200
Give it to me. Who said I want that?

52:01.118 --> 52:02.869
It seemed like you were hesitating.

52:04.037 --> 52:06.581
Just stop reading that weird book.

52:06.665 --> 52:09.042
Think about whether you posted
anything online.

52:10.001 --> 52:11.044
I told you I didn't.

52:11.545 --> 52:15.507
Even if you see new things around here,
you can't put it up online.

52:16.007 --> 52:20.428
I have a lot of friends
who work in research.

52:22.556 --> 52:25.976
Then those running shoes
that wrapped around my feet were

52:26.268 --> 52:27.853
from a friend in research?

52:28.562 --> 52:29.396
Yes.

52:29.479 --> 52:32.649
Then how come none of them
came to the wedding?

52:33.650 --> 52:35.360
You never introduced them to me.

52:36.653 --> 52:38.780
When I think about it, you're shady.

52:40.198 --> 52:41.449
They did come.

52:41.533 --> 52:43.160
You just didn't see them.

52:45.829 --> 52:47.205
Maybe Gun-sook is right.

52:47.706 --> 52:49.541
Maybe I don't know you very well.

52:52.335 --> 52:55.297
We just need to submit the marriage report
and have a baby.

52:55.380 --> 52:56.798
All we need to do is live well.

52:57.632 --> 52:58.508
Baby?

52:59.176 --> 53:00.635
Yes, we should have one soon.

53:01.720 --> 53:04.139
Like a "wah, wah" baby?

53:04.472 --> 53:05.307
Yes.

53:06.224 --> 53:08.351
Oh, my, seriously?

53:09.227 --> 53:10.145
What?

53:10.562 --> 53:14.149
Didn't you join the Mom Café online
because you want to have a baby?

53:14.232 --> 53:15.734
Why pretend otherwise now?

53:15.817 --> 53:17.611
Don't say those things. It's creepy.

53:18.320 --> 53:19.946
I'm serious about it.

53:20.739 --> 53:23.575
You don't want a little Flower?

53:23.825 --> 53:24.826
She would be cute.

53:27.412 --> 53:29.831
Do you think we have the right
to be parents?

53:30.665 --> 53:31.625
Of course I do.

53:32.083 --> 53:36.004
I'm young and rich,
and my genes are of top-notch.

53:37.214 --> 53:40.091
I don't want to have kids thoughtlessly
like my mom and dad did.

53:41.551 --> 53:45.305
No baby until I can be certain
we will be good parents.

53:46.765 --> 53:47.849
Why is that?

53:48.433 --> 53:50.518
Do you not trust me?

53:53.146 --> 53:57.943
Just now, I wondered…
"Maybe I don't know you very well."

53:59.653 --> 54:03.156
Feeding and sheltering doesn't mean
you're a good parent.

54:03.907 --> 54:07.160
Well, we probably won't die too soon,

54:07.244 --> 54:09.496
but what if we do? The kids...

54:11.581 --> 54:12.540
I mean...

54:23.385 --> 54:24.302
You're right.

54:25.095 --> 54:27.639
What if we happen to die?

54:29.516 --> 54:30.892
It would be irresponsible.

54:34.813 --> 54:36.439
I didn't think that far ahead.

54:43.571 --> 54:45.448
I didn't mean that...

54:45.991 --> 54:48.493
I don't want to have a baby
without thinking it through.

55:07.762 --> 55:11.266
MARRIAGE REPORT

55:17.397 --> 55:18.690
I'm scared.

55:19.816 --> 55:21.234
Don't leave.

56:23.421 --> 56:24.381
Is he sleeping?

56:33.348 --> 56:34.599
Did he leave already?

56:42.732 --> 56:47.404
<i>Realtor, do you think you can get</i>
<i>more Ohri Ramen from your friend?</i>

56:47.529 --> 56:48.947
<i>I can't stop thinking about it.</i>

56:49.447 --> 56:50.698
<i>I'll eat it in secret.</i>

56:50.865 --> 56:53.618
<i>No. It's not so easy to get.</i>

56:54.786 --> 56:56.538
2018 BIG HIT OHRI RAMEN

56:56.704 --> 56:58.915
JANUARY 2018, FUTURE

57:00.542 --> 57:03.420
What if something happens
after I buy so much like this?

57:03.920 --> 57:05.630
No. Cancel that.

57:05.713 --> 57:07.132
I won't jinx it.

57:08.049 --> 57:09.717
-Hello.
-Oh, hi.

57:09.926 --> 57:12.137
-Wait, Manager Cheon.
-Yes?

57:12.720 --> 57:14.472
Did you find a photographer?

57:14.639 --> 57:17.142
It's next week, so no one can fit it
in their schedule.

57:17.267 --> 57:18.351
I'll keep looking.

57:18.435 --> 57:21.062
Then I'll look into it.

57:21.855 --> 57:24.691
-You can take care of your other work.
-I'd appreciate that.

57:25.233 --> 57:27.485
-Thank you.
-No problem.

57:29.279 --> 57:31.990
I hope I'm not taking up your time.

57:32.532 --> 57:35.410
I should be buying you a meal
at a nice place.

57:38.079 --> 57:39.789
I'll get straight to the point.

57:40.290 --> 57:42.375
I'll give you the chance
to do something good.

57:43.668 --> 57:46.212
I would like it if you would just say yes.

57:47.797 --> 57:51.926
We're doing a ceremony for the opening
of our thirtieth house.

57:52.343 --> 57:54.929
Can you come and take pictures?

57:57.223 --> 57:58.308
A donation of talent?

57:58.391 --> 58:02.479
Yes, we want to publish
a special publication of this event.

58:04.355 --> 58:08.610
Shouldn't you find
someone with skill for that?

58:08.693 --> 58:11.779
Oh, I got rejected.

58:11.863 --> 58:13.072
Oh, no.

58:14.073 --> 58:16.993
I'm just wondering if my talent is
at a level that can donate.

58:19.204 --> 58:22.540
Why don't I send you my portfolio?

58:22.624 --> 58:26.294
Examine it closely to see if I'm
good enough, and then contact me.

58:26.461 --> 58:30.298
Then, you mean you do want to do it?

58:31.758 --> 58:35.011
I would be so happy to do it.

58:35.428 --> 58:37.680
I do have to start working.

58:38.806 --> 58:40.808
But, this is charity.

58:41.392 --> 58:43.394
I won't receive a per diem, right?

58:44.145 --> 58:45.063
A what?

58:47.649 --> 58:48.650
It's nothing.

58:48.900 --> 58:51.444
-I don't expect anything.
-Okay.

58:51.736 --> 58:53.696
I'm just feeling a bit anxious.

58:54.531 --> 58:55.573
It's nothing.

58:55.907 --> 58:58.159
I'm okay whenever you need me.

58:59.744 --> 59:02.080
It's so nice to see.

59:03.289 --> 59:05.083
The son started Happiness

59:05.542 --> 59:07.502
The daughter-in-law is doing
charity there.

59:08.753 --> 59:12.882
So-joon's parents really should be
seeing this.

59:15.635 --> 59:18.304
He started Happiness?

59:24.561 --> 59:25.520
Mister!

59:28.815 --> 59:30.066
Hey, you...

59:35.196 --> 59:39.492
You're from now, right?

59:40.910 --> 59:43.371
I'm here from 2016.

59:46.541 --> 59:48.293
Why have you changed so much?

59:48.376 --> 59:49.877
Did you go through hard times?

59:49.961 --> 59:51.713
I don't want to talk to past you.

59:51.796 --> 59:53.172
Where are you going?

59:53.298 --> 59:55.425
I went to your place and no one was there.

59:56.175 --> 59:57.552
I mean in my time.

59:57.844 --> 1:00:00.096
I couldn't meet you, so I came here.

1:00:00.805 --> 1:00:03.224
How have I been living all that time?

1:00:04.058 --> 1:00:05.435
We can talk about that later.

1:00:05.810 --> 1:00:08.271
What's with your monk style?

1:00:08.354 --> 1:00:10.106
-Let's go inside and talk.
-I'm busy.

1:00:10.189 --> 1:00:11.566
Let's just go in for a moment.

1:00:11.649 --> 1:00:13.484
We just met. What would we talk about?

1:00:13.568 --> 1:00:15.403
Have you tried Ohri Ramen?

1:00:15.486 --> 1:00:16.654
It's really good.

1:00:16.738 --> 1:00:19.324
-No...
-You look like you haven't eaten.

1:00:19.407 --> 1:00:22.327
-You punk.
-I just have a lot I'm curious about.

1:00:23.328 --> 1:00:24.287
Just for a bit.

1:00:25.413 --> 1:00:26.748
It's our first time meeting.

1:00:27.665 --> 1:00:28.583
Come in.

1:00:35.548 --> 1:00:37.050
Should I cook you two ramens?

1:00:46.017 --> 1:00:48.519
Did I move out?

1:00:52.607 --> 1:00:54.567
Did something happen to me?

1:00:57.070 --> 1:00:58.154
I don't know either.

1:01:10.124 --> 1:01:11.084
What is this?

1:01:26.432 --> 1:01:27.392
Damn it.

1:01:28.685 --> 1:01:30.269
My journal is gone, too.

1:01:30.436 --> 1:01:32.438
Tell me. What happened?

1:01:33.690 --> 1:01:35.191
I couldn't get in touch with you.

1:01:37.193 --> 1:01:38.778
A long time since I've seen you.

1:01:40.321 --> 1:01:42.031
But why?

1:01:43.116 --> 1:01:44.659
What are you talking about?

1:01:44.742 --> 1:01:46.577
Why wouldn't we be in touch?

1:01:46.661 --> 1:01:48.037
Because you disappeared.

1:01:52.417 --> 1:01:54.544
You disappeared, So-joon.

1:01:56.796 --> 1:01:57.922
What are you saying?

1:01:59.924 --> 1:02:01.843
Why would I disappear?

1:02:04.178 --> 1:02:05.221
What about Ma-rin?

1:02:05.430 --> 1:02:07.807
-Where is Song Ma-rin?
-Don't ask me anything.

1:02:10.017 --> 1:02:12.353
I've come to regret having you by my side.

1:02:15.064 --> 1:02:19.193
It's hard... to see your face like this.

1:02:20.820 --> 1:02:21.696
I'm leaving.

1:02:23.156 --> 1:02:25.158
Explain it to me so that I understand.

1:02:25.491 --> 1:02:27.994
Mister, did I make a mistake or something?

1:02:28.953 --> 1:02:31.539
This isn't some sort of fun riddle!

1:03:02.361 --> 1:03:04.155
<i>He started Happiness?</i>

1:03:05.698 --> 1:03:06.574
<i>Yes.</i>

1:03:07.617 --> 1:03:11.829
<i>So, a long time ago,</i>
<i>when So-joon's parents were alive,</i>

1:03:12.872 --> 1:03:16.834
they operated a small charity
called Happiness.

1:03:20.213 --> 1:03:23.257
After they passed in the accident
at Namyeong...

1:03:25.927 --> 1:03:27.595
The accident at Namyeong Station?

1:03:29.555 --> 1:03:33.810
Didn't So-joon tell you about this?

1:03:36.604 --> 1:03:40.107
No... I heard about it, of course.

1:03:42.276 --> 1:03:43.945
Please, keep going.

1:03:44.445 --> 1:03:45.488
So,

1:03:45.988 --> 1:03:48.366
it had been about a year.

1:03:48.699 --> 1:03:52.411
He said to me that he wanted to make
Happiness again properly.

1:03:53.454 --> 1:03:55.164
So, I took over the operations.

1:03:55.706 --> 1:03:59.710
The Happiness that exists now is
what was created by So-joon.

1:04:00.211 --> 1:04:02.630
He is the largest financial supporter.

1:04:03.756 --> 1:04:07.593
But he doesn't let us even bring it up.

1:04:08.845 --> 1:04:12.098
It must bring up some bitter memories.

1:04:13.224 --> 1:04:15.560
Even so, that kid...

1:04:16.269 --> 1:04:21.649
How could he not tell the person
he married?

1:04:39.584 --> 1:04:43.796
Are So-joon's parents here?

1:05:37.350 --> 1:05:40.311
<i>Why did I leave Ma-rin and disappear?</i>

1:05:40.728 --> 1:05:41.896
<i>You went abroad.</i>

1:05:42.438 --> 1:05:43.856
<i>You broke up with Ma-rin.</i>

1:05:44.315 --> 1:05:47.610
<i>It seems like he's hiding many secrets.</i>

1:05:47.693 --> 1:05:49.820
If I happened to disappear one morning,

1:05:49.904 --> 1:05:51.072
what would you do?

1:05:51.405 --> 1:05:55.284
<i>Then is Realtor riding around</i>
<i>in a time machine or something?</i>

1:05:55.368 --> 1:05:58.454
<i>I'll have to search time</i>
<i>to find traces of myself.</i>

1:05:58.537 --> 1:06:00.247
<i>Why did he lie?</i>

1:06:00.665 --> 1:06:04.710
<i>I think my future has become</i>
<i>more twisted than before.</i>

1:06:08.047 --> 1:06:10.049
