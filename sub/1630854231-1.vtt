Happy hunting.

Good job, Hans.

02:17.159 --> 02:18.859

- Fire at will!

Flood one and two!

02:28.357 --> 02:29.691
Fire at will!

02:33.441 --> 02:34.875
45 seconds for impact.

02:42.184 --> 02:43.251
Sir, what is going on?

02:48.210 --> 02:50.838
The ship is coming directly towards us.

02:51.159 --> 02:51.859
Ram us?

02:56.531 --> 02:58.200
All power
towards the engines, hurry.

03:25.826 --> 03:27.761
Sir, we must

03:30.210 --> 03:31.295
Yes.

Hurry up.

03:35.132 --> 03:36.675

Yes, sir.

What are my orders, Commander?

13:47.982 --> 13:48.816
Why am I here?

13:49.851 --> 13:51.053
Straight to the point.

13:52.254 --> 13:55.656
It is no secret, the U-boats
have been performing poorly.

13:55.990 --> 13:57.458
The British and the Americans

13:57.558 --> 14:00.761
have made
it a priority to hunt us down.

14:00.862 --> 14:01.996
The Fuhrer has not been pleased.

14:03.731 --> 14:05.933
The Fuhrer needed more boats,

14:06.667 --> 14:07.501
ask to bring in the others.

14:08.836 --> 14:10.004
Let me show you something.

14:21.716 --> 14:22.550
You see this?

14:26.188 --> 14:27.855
It's the American coast.

14:27.955 --> 14:30.691
New York City, the heart
of the American war effort.

14:31.726 --> 14:32.660
Operation Sea Wolf.

14:35.730 --> 14:37.899
We tried these operations,
we have failed.

14:44.206 --> 14:48.076
V-1 rocket,
Hitler's wonder weapon.

14:49.710 --> 14:54.049
We shall equip these
rockets to our U-boats

14:54.149 --> 14:55.917
and attack the American coast.

14:57.919 --> 15:01.189
Our fleets will strike fear
into the heart of the enemy.

15:02.556 --> 15:03.958
You will lead the pack.

15:11.632 --> 15:13.501
At the beginning of the war,

15:13.601 --> 15:17.939
our pack ruled the waves,
steel, blood, fire, fear.

15:19.807 --> 15:21.642
These were our thoughts.

15:21.742 --> 15:24.779
Now we have our dreams
of one of our person,

15:24.879 --> 15:27.748
victory is out of our grasp.

15:31.819 --> 15:34.455
The Fuhrer has spared no
expense for this operation.

15:37.625 --> 15:38.226
No expense.

15:39.127 --> 15:39.961
None.

15:45.833 --> 15:47.001
A pack needs wolves.

15:50.771 --> 15:52.074
Let me show you some wolves.

16:01.249 --> 16:02.750
Attention.

16:10.891 --> 16:11.993
Your wolves.

16:26.141 --> 16:29.111
These are not wolves but boys.

16:31.645 --> 16:33.181
Young boys.

16:33.281 --> 16:35.283
Were you and
I much different from them?

16:35.384 --> 16:36.984
When the war started,

16:37.085 --> 16:40.188
I spent nine months with my
men before going into action.

16:42.957 --> 16:45.860
They have had the finest
training Germany has to offer.

16:47.362 --> 16:49.131
Do they know what the risks are?

16:50.032 --> 16:50.998
They know the risks.

16:52.034 --> 16:54.835
They are ready to die
for country and Fuhrer.

17:06.747 --> 17:08.050
These are not Kriegsmarine.

17:10.218 --> 17:12.186
Then teach them Kriegsmarine.

18:10.945 --> 18:12.247
I will do it.

18:24.126 --> 18:25.327
Operation Sea Wolf.

18:27.395 --> 18:30.831
You will leave with three ships.

18:30.931 --> 18:33.135
Seven more will join you
when you are out to sea.

18:36.404 --> 18:38.806
10 boats.

18:40.342 --> 18:42.977
You will be the spear
point for more to follow.

18:47.115 --> 18:50.418
And I'll see our targets?

18:50.519 --> 18:52.920
Allied shipping lanes,
north of New York.

18:53.020 --> 18:53.821
The missile attack?

18:54.289 --> 18:55.123
New York City.

18:58.260 --> 18:59.294
Departure?

19:00.162 --> 19:01.829

19:03.265 --> 19:06.434

19:06.535 --> 19:11.306
I like to meet my
officers and see the boat.

19:11.739 --> 19:13.108
I would expect nothing less.

19:20.148 --> 19:23.017
The officers of U-546.

19:27.988 --> 19:29.391
You, Lieutenant.

19:29.491 --> 19:31.092
Lieutenant Erich Reinhart, sir.

19:31.193 --> 19:33.128
Acting captain of U-546.

19:34.029 --> 19:34.828
Captain?

19:36.231 --> 19:38.832
Reinhart was
in line to be captain,

19:38.933 --> 19:41.835
but under your leadership
he was glad to step aside.

19:42.937 --> 19:45.073
Isn't that right, Lieutenant?

19:47.841 --> 19:50.078
I'm looking forward to
serving under your command.

19:51.546 --> 19:52.880

- Operational?
- Engines are ready, sir.

20:00.388 --> 20:01.722

20:04.059 --> 20:05.227
Good, good.

20:07.795 --> 20:13.201
Good. Let's go inspect
my boat and get some food.

20:28.882 --> 20:29.517

20:31.986 --> 20:33.221

20:33.321 --> 20:34.289
Yes, sir.

20:47.402 --> 20:48.436

20:49.070 --> 20:49.903

20:50.971 --> 20:52.474
Operation Sea Wolf is a go.

22:35.377 --> 22:37.512

the crew, and the mission.

22:38.646 --> 22:39.481
Are you prepared?

22:42.384 --> 22:46.421
If the crew is half as good
as the boats, I'm confident

22:50.258 --> 22:51.526
under the circumstances.

a bond forged out of the ocean.

24:11.372 --> 24:13.608
A U-boat's
crew is life, the blood.

24:15.443 --> 24:18.446

to surface of the sea.

24:21.616 --> 24:23.485

knots, starboard 108 degrees.

smoothly, batteries charged.

25:18.673 --> 25:19.707
Good. Take her down
to periscope depth.

25:20.575 --> 25:22.277
Want her under the surface.

25:23.344 --> 25:25.113
Yes, Captain.

25:25.213 --> 25:26.481
Periscope depth.

25:26.581 --> 25:27.549
Periscope depth.

25:42.263 --> 25:44.198
Intelligence has
indicated the U-boat pack

25:44.299 --> 25:45.600
has left their pens at Trondheim

25:45.700 --> 25:47.535
and are making for open ocean.

25:47.635 --> 25:49.671
They'll drop down into
the Northern fishing lanes.

25:49.771 --> 25:51.339
They'll hide in and out of them.

25:51.439 --> 25:53.608
They will be using snorkels,
it's hard to track.

25:53.708 --> 25:55.376
Yeah, they'll be going slow.

25:55.476 --> 25:57.278
Give us a chance to get
into position and intercept.

25:57.545 --> 25:59.847
The 10th fleet is ready with
escort carriers and destroyers.

25:59.948 --> 26:01.583

27:16.491 --> 27:18.693
Operation Teardrop is a go.

27:19.327 --> 27:21.262
They're really going
to let us hunt subs?

27:21.362 --> 27:22.363
Oh, we are in the hunt.

27:23.431 --> 27:24.265
Yes, sir.

27:25.667 --> 27:27.435
- Helmsman?
- Aye aye, sir.

27:34.530 --> 27:37.032
Don't be like that, you wimp.

27:37.115 --> 27:40.536
- Do you guys have anything for me?
- No, shut up.

27:41.620 --> 27:44.373
What I'd give for a good beer right now.

27:44.456 --> 27:46.625
Are you ready for battle,
my fellow soldiers?

27:46.667 --> 27:49.044
- Yes.
- We will defeat them.

27:49.127 --> 27:51.630
I have a bag of potatoes here.

27:52.714 --> 27:54.550
And I also have chocolate.

27:54.633 --> 27:56.468
- No, no.
- Great.

28:13.861 --> 28:15.612
- All right?
- Yes, well done.

28:15.696 --> 28:16.530
Yes.

28:31.066 --> 28:32.500
Apologies, Captain.

28:32.600 --> 28:34.569
I haven't had a chance
to finish cleaning out

28:34.669 --> 28:35.636
my personal belongings.

28:37.405 --> 28:38.239
Hitler youth.

28:41.409 --> 28:44.612
His blood, his honor.
It was my brother's.

28:45.780 --> 28:48.549
He was killed in
Normandy by Americans.

28:52.453 --> 28:54.522
I'm sorry to
hear that, Lieutenant.

28:58.426 --> 28:59.894
Now, I understand
I'm taking your command

28:59.994 --> 29:01.763
of this boat away.

29:01.863 --> 29:03.965
You are my second in command,

29:04.066 --> 29:06.601
you must obey all my
orders without question.

29:06.701 --> 29:07.468
Is that clear?

29:07.869 --> 29:08.903
Yes, Captain.

29:09.937 --> 29:12.340
On this boat, we all
have a duty to perform.

29:13.441 --> 29:16.044
Under my command, what matters
is the defeat of the enemy,

29:16.145 --> 29:19.047
the lives of the crew, and
the safety of this boat.

29:20.481 --> 29:21.315
Understood?

29:21.949 --> 29:23.551
Yes, sir.

29:23.651 --> 29:24.852
Good.

29:24.952 --> 29:25.820
Now what's your report?

29:27.588 --> 29:28.956
U-894 is falling behind.

29:30.792 --> 29:32.326
Why is he falling behind?

29:32.560 --> 29:33.594
Engine trouble.

29:36.931 --> 29:39.867
Radio U-578, let him know.

29:39.967 --> 29:41.069
Yes, sir.

29:41.170 --> 29:42.637
Keep her sturdy and on course.

29:44.005 --> 29:45.940
We have to make up for
any time we might lose.

29:47.109 --> 29:48.009
Yes, Captain.

30:25.980 --> 30:28.850
- Sleeping little boy?
- Sleeping.

31:01.183 --> 31:02.817
Do you plan on using that?

31:03.651 --> 31:04.986
What?

31:05.087 --> 31:05.920
I hope not on me.

31:07.055 --> 31:08.090
Don't tempt me.

31:08.522 --> 31:10.024
I never got my knife.

31:11.893 --> 31:13.561
My family couldn't afford it.

31:14.762 --> 31:15.863
Didn't have enough money.

31:18.599 --> 31:20.035
How is our new Captain?

31:21.869 --> 31:23.404
Settled into my quarters.

31:28.542 --> 31:30.045
The whole crew is on your side.

31:31.779 --> 31:32.747
Men like Kessler,

31:35.716 --> 31:36.617
their time has passed.

31:42.257 --> 31:44.059
Get the diesels up and running.

31:44.159 --> 31:45.593
Send reports every 20 minutes.

31:46.761 --> 31:48.462
Captain's orders.

31:48.896 --> 31:50.698
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

31:50.798 --> 31:51.732
Heil Hitler.

31:56.570 --> 31:57.672
Helmsman.

31:57.939 --> 31:59.573
Right rudder, 20 degrees.

31:59.674 --> 32:01.575
Maintaining current course.

32:01.676 --> 32:03.577
Sir, we have sonar contact.

32:03.678 --> 32:05.579
- Ships on the surface?
- I think so, sir.

32:06.681 --> 32:08.083
What is it?

32:08.183 --> 32:09.217
Contact with the enemy.

32:10.218 --> 32:11.086
Do you have the boats confirmed?

32:11.919 --> 32:13.554
Reinhart, check.

32:13.955 --> 32:15.589
Yes, sir.

32:15.690 --> 32:16.724
Should I get the captain?

32:17.625 --> 32:18.459
Not yet.

32:21.963 --> 32:23.564
Reinhart, report!

32:23.998 --> 32:26.567
Sir, multiple
ships coming in fast.

32:42.250 --> 32:44.785
The other U-boats
were reporting the same.

32:44.885 --> 32:45.953
I have visual contact.

32:47.055 --> 32:48.923
- Convoy?
- Yes.

32:50.158 --> 32:52.560
U-578 is asking to engage.

32:53.661 --> 32:54.628
What should we tell them?

32:56.964 --> 32:58.133
This could be our first kill.

32:59.201 --> 33:00.168
We can't give that order.

33:00.835 --> 33:02.037
We need the captain.

33:05.006 --> 33:06.174
Give the order to engage.

33:08.143 --> 33:08.976
Yes, sir.

33:12.913 --> 33:13.948
Now get the Captain.

33:16.884 --> 33:17.718
Yes, sir.

33:30.965 --> 33:32.633
Why have the diesels stopped?

33:32.733 --> 33:36.138
Captain, enemy contact,
convoy merchant vessels,

33:36.238 --> 33:38.005
U-578 has started to engage.

33:38.106 --> 33:39.174
Who gave that order?

33:40.175 --> 33:41.575
Torpedoes in the water!

33:41.675 --> 33:43.078
Captain, torpedoes in the water.

33:44.612 --> 33:45.946
Up periscope, move.

33:46.048 --> 33:47.548
Up periscope!

34:13.808 --> 34:14.842
It's a hit.

34:15.643 --> 34:16.643
It's a hit.

34:28.255 --> 34:30.991
Another hit. Another hit.

34:35.263 --> 34:36.597
Ready the torpedoes.

34:38.433 --> 34:40.900
I will call off the ranges.
Battle stations.

34:43.938 --> 34:45.072
Battle stations!

34:47.208 --> 34:48.342
Battle stations,
battle stations,

34:48.443 --> 34:50.344
battle stations,
battle stations!

35:06.961 --> 35:09.897
Sir, a convoy was just hit.
Looks like U-Boats.

35:09.997 --> 35:11.799
- Where?
- Grid section 473.

35:13.000 --> 35:16.404
That's our pack. Launch
all the birds from Greely.

35:16.505 --> 35:18.406
I want all
available forces on that spot.

35:18.507 --> 35:20.975
- I'll inform the 10th.
- I need all eyes out there.

35:21.076 --> 35:22.410
- Yes, sir.
- Go.

35:49.371 --> 35:50.838
The snorkel is
giving us trouble.

35:51.839 --> 35:53.441
It'd be better if
we get to the surface.

35:53.542 --> 35:54.775
Damaged?

35:55.776 --> 35:56.744
Hard to tell unless
we get to the surface.

35:57.811 --> 35:58.746
Call the engine room.

36:05.753 --> 36:08.056
- Yeah?
- The electric motor's charging?

36:08.156 --> 36:09.890
Not sufficiently.

36:09.990 --> 36:11.126
The diesels?

36:11.226 --> 36:12.460
Might be best to
do a surface check.

36:13.827 --> 36:14.462
Right.

36:18.832 --> 36:19.967
What's going on?

36:20.068 --> 36:21.835
Batteries are
not fully charging.

36:21.936 --> 36:24.239
We need to go to the surface
and check the snorkel.

36:24.339 --> 36:25.739
Take it to the surface.

36:26.208 --> 36:27.708
Radio?

36:28.008 --> 36:29.277
Inform the other
boats we are surfacing

36:29.377 --> 36:30.811
for a maintenance check.

36:30.911 --> 36:31.912
Yes, sir.

36:33.013 --> 36:34.249
Rouse the deck crew!

36:36.850 --> 36:37.885
Take us to the surface.

36:37.985 --> 36:38.953
Yes, sir.

37:18.126 --> 37:19.060
Where's the Captain?

37:20.995 --> 37:21.829
Passed out again.

37:23.831 --> 37:25.166
Keep her steady.

37:25.400 --> 37:27.235
I don't need
anybody going overboard.

37:37.145 --> 37:38.079
We have an issue.

37:41.182 --> 37:42.983
- What is it?
- See for yourself.

37:45.953 --> 37:46.787
What is going on?

37:49.457 --> 37:51.426
Get the machine guns
from the weapons rack.

37:54.095 --> 37:54.928
Weapons!

38:05.640 --> 38:06.474
Survivors?

38:08.410 --> 38:09.444
It's not clear.

38:11.212 --> 38:12.314
We can't take on survivors.

38:15.383 --> 38:16.418
Ready the deck guns,

38:17.285 --> 38:19.154
we can't take any chances.

38:19.254 --> 38:20.455
Won't the Captain notice?

38:22.490 --> 38:23.924
He will think he gave the order.

38:24.024 --> 38:24.992
Right.

38:35.136 --> 38:36.438
Is that a deck gun?

38:36.538 --> 38:38.273
- Yes, sir.
- Who are they shooting at?

38:38.373 --> 38:39.873
We spotted lifeboats.

38:39.973 --> 38:41.476
I thought it best
to leave no survivors.

38:41.576 --> 38:43.345
I did not give that order.

38:44.079 --> 38:46.047
Can't the survivors
give away our location?

38:46.147 --> 38:48.450
Idiot.
We could be spotted.

38:49.517 --> 38:50.851
Sir, who could see us out here?

38:50.951 --> 38:52.120
Aircraft.

38:52.220 --> 38:54.456
Get the men below. Now, go.

39:18.413 --> 39:20.215
All hands to battle stations.

39:20.315 --> 39:21.349
Prepare the ship to dive.

39:23.984 --> 39:26.388
Inform the other submarines
of evasive action.

39:30.058 --> 39:33.994
Engine room,
95% to both engines.

39:34.095 --> 39:34.662
Now.

39:45.673 --> 39:46.508
There!

39:48.543 --> 39:49.677
Quickly.

40:05.572 --> 40:07.574
They're coming!

40:11.599 --> 40:13.101
What is going on?

40:13.468 --> 40:14.469
We're under air attack.

40:17.209 --> 40:18.620
Fire at will!

40:22.510 --> 40:25.046
Get up, we don't have much time.

40:32.420 --> 40:33.455
Speer.

40:36.157 --> 40:36.990
Speer!

40:48.770 --> 40:52.073
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

40:57.278 --> 40:59.481
Pull the ballast.
We need to dive, now.

40:59.581 --> 41:01.716
Prepare to dive.
Close the ballast.

41:05.787 --> 41:07.322
They are coming in
for the another attack.

41:07.422 --> 41:08.423
Where's the others?

41:08.523 --> 41:09.624
They are dead.

41:11.159 --> 41:11.956
Sir, we can...

41:11.980 --> 41:14.395
You put the life of this
crew and this boat in danger.

41:15.196 --> 41:17.465
Lieutenant Lutz,
confine Lieutenant Reinhart

41:17.565 --> 41:19.133
to the mess
quarters under guard.

41:19.234 --> 41:22.002
- Sir.
- You must decide whose orders you follow.

41:25.373 --> 41:27.475
Dive. Dive!

41:52.100 --> 41:53.601
Sir, Navy planes
have engaged the sub.

41:55.837 --> 41:58.540
- What's the location?
- Grid section 9-47-4.

42:06.214 --> 42:09.150
Get the fleet to make
for grid section 1455.

42:10.752 --> 42:12.620
- This could be our break. Go ahead.
- Yes, sir.

42:33.675 --> 42:35.143
Left full rudder.

42:35.243 --> 42:36.644
- Left full rudder.
- Yes, sir.

42:37.745 --> 42:40.381
Sir, U-578 has
made sonar contact

42:40.481 --> 42:41.749
with ships on the surface.

42:43.718 --> 42:45.286
Up periscope.

42:45.620 --> 42:46.821
- Yes, sir.
- Up periscope.

43:01.903 --> 43:03.438
Periscope depth, sir.

43:33.801 --> 43:35.336
Take it down to 50 meters.

43:35.436 --> 43:36.404
Sir?

43:38.439 --> 43:40.408
American destroyers, carriers.

43:40.508 --> 43:41.476
50 meters, sir.

43:49.250 --> 43:50.618
Ollie.

43:50.718 --> 43:52.420
- Up five, down 10.
- Yes, sir.

43:59.794 --> 44:02.797
Now hear this,
this is the Captain.

44:05.233 --> 44:06.901
We made surface
contact with enemy ships.

44:08.803 --> 44:10.271
<font color="#32D838"> <i>We'll</i> </font>
<font color="#32D838"> <i>the ships head on.</i> </font>

44:11.939 --> 44:12.840
We're underneath them.

44:13.975 --> 44:16.844
<font color="#32D838"> <i>Close enough for
the sonar not to pick up.</i> </font>

44:18.880 --> 44:20.715
With any luck,

44:21.015 --> 44:22.316
we'll pass unnoticed.

44:38.466 --> 44:40.368
Keep on the present course.

44:40.468 --> 44:41.235
Yes, sir.

44:43.271 --> 44:46.474
We should be under the boats,
in the clear, seven minutes.

44:48.309 --> 44:48.943
Seven minutes?

44:51.345 --> 44:52.480
Set.

45:04.859 --> 45:06.894
Sir.

45:06.994 --> 45:07.895
Something on sonar.

45:09.797 --> 45:11.632
Have the jersey
bear 20 degrees port.

45:11.733 --> 45:13.568
Aye, sir.

45:13.668 --> 45:15.403
Wait for my orders and then
proceed to drop depth charges.

45:15.937 --> 45:18.372
Port 15 degrees, half speed.

45:18.473 --> 45:19.540
Right standard rudder.

45:19.640 --> 45:20.808
Aye aye, sir.

45:51.706 --> 45:52.740
Four minutes.

45:54.742 --> 45:55.643
There you go, sir.

45:55.877 --> 45:56.911
Thank you.

45:59.814 --> 46:02.884
Sir, contact bearing
two niner five port side.

46:02.984 --> 46:04.619
- Go for jersey.
- Yes, sir.

46:04.719 --> 46:05.987
- Drop depth charges.
- Aye, sir.

46:24.672 --> 46:25.673
Two minutes.

46:47.162 --> 46:49.864
Come on, come on.

46:56.971 --> 46:57.805
Launch hedgehogs!

47:49.490 --> 47:50.858
Sir?

47:51.159 --> 47:52.994
Oil slick on the water.

47:53.095 --> 47:56.697
We got 'em!

48:10.078 --> 48:12.880
The 10th is reporting contact
and taking men in a sub.

48:13.915 --> 48:15.050
- Just one?
- For now.

48:16.251 --> 48:17.085
It's a pack!

48:18.719 --> 48:20.855
- There's more than one.
- Right, sir.

48:20.955 --> 48:22.957
Tell them to keep hunting. Go.

48:38.739 --> 48:39.573
We are safe.

48:44.146 --> 48:47.049
Sir, we've lost
contact with U-578.

48:48.749 --> 48:49.650
Nothing but static.

48:55.589 --> 48:57.959
We continue.
We have our orders.

48:58.160 --> 48:59.760
Keep her steady, six knots.

49:00.828 --> 49:02.197
We surface at nightfall.

49:02.297 --> 49:03.664
Yes, sir.

49:24.685 --> 49:26.188
The captain needs small arms.

49:26.921 --> 49:28.656
Two machine pistols.

49:29.191 --> 49:30.524
I'm going to need to confirm.

49:51.079 --> 49:52.114
Sir.

49:52.947 --> 49:55.117
The 10th has lost sonar contact.

49:55.217 --> 49:58.552
They are sweeping the area, but
so far, no new developments.

49:58.652 --> 50:00.155
If there were more boats,
they got away.

50:04.292 --> 50:06.161
Keep 'em sweeping
back towards the coast.

50:06.761 --> 50:08.929
Contact the Coast Guard
and double their patrols.

50:09.031 --> 50:09.964
Keep their eyes open.

50:10.065 --> 50:11.033
Yes, sir.

50:27.349 --> 50:28.150
Sergeant.

50:29.683 --> 50:32.920
Let them know we have to
join the other U-boats.

50:33.020 --> 50:33.943
Yes, sir.

50:33.967 --> 50:36.291
Attack on the United
States coast is imminent.

50:36.391 --> 50:37.259
Yes, sir.

50:37.958 --> 50:39.094
Sir.

50:39.194 --> 50:40.861
We have a problem.

50:40.961 --> 50:42.330
What?

50:42.431 --> 50:43.831
It's Lieutenant Reinhart.

50:59.081 --> 51:00.614
Stay back.

51:14.829 --> 51:15.963
Reinhart.

51:34.182 --> 51:35.150
Stay back!

51:39.121 --> 51:41.289
Lieutenant,
hand that pistol over.

51:42.157 --> 51:43.657
We'll forget
about this incident.

51:47.695 --> 51:48.796
I got those men killed.

51:50.298 --> 51:51.799
They are dead because of me.

51:54.035 --> 51:55.070
I failed my ship.

51:55.970 --> 51:59.241
I failed the crew,
and I failed you.

52:00.875 --> 52:03.311
Your failure, with thanks
to my poor leadership.

52:04.212 --> 52:05.946
Hand the pistol over.

52:06.047 --> 52:07.415
I said stay back!

52:14.156 --> 52:15.257
During the Great War,

52:17.159 --> 52:21.096
a new branch of service,
U-boat, became available.

52:22.464 --> 52:24.199
Many of my peers volunteered.

52:25.400 --> 52:27.102
Few were chosen.

52:27.202 --> 52:28.303
I was one of the few.

52:34.909 --> 52:38.380
My first day at sea,
a man was washed overboard.

52:39.047 --> 52:43.051
I asked the captain to start
a rescue operation, he refused.

52:47.389 --> 52:50.392
On a U-boat, every man's
decided his own fate.

52:52.360 --> 52:54.296
Destiny takes control.

52:54.929 --> 52:55.896
We cannot look back.

52:57.065 --> 52:57.932
We must look forward.

53:03.938 --> 53:06.274
My duty is to use every man on
this ship to complete our mission.

53:06.374 --> 53:08.043
That includes you, Reinhart.

53:33.000 --> 53:37.372
Do not let the mistakes of your
past determine your future.

53:50.151 --> 53:53.121
Your watch starts
in five minutes. Go.

53:58.593 --> 53:59.793
Yes, Captain.

55:42.397 --> 55:43.498
We have contact.

55:45.400 --> 55:47.168
We are close to the coast.

55:47.268 --> 55:48.036
Yes, sir.

55:50.003 --> 55:52.474
Notify the engine room.
Cut power to the diesels.

55:53.375 --> 55:54.509
Yes, sir.

55:54.609 --> 55:56.144
Where's Lieutenant Reinhart?

55:56.378 --> 55:57.345
He's on watch.

55:59.314 --> 56:01.049
I'm going up top.

56:01.149 --> 56:02.217
Yes, sir.

56:21.202 --> 56:22.036
Cold night.

56:23.204 --> 56:24.239
Yes, sir.

56:32.280 --> 56:34.516
If we keep her on our
starboard, she won't notice us.

56:36.217 --> 56:37.252
How?

56:38.753 --> 56:40.388
At night,
the outline of our boat

56:40.488 --> 56:41.689
will line up with her stern.

56:44.159 --> 56:45.560
A blind spot?

56:45.660 --> 56:46.428
Yes.

56:48.296 --> 56:49.697
Make sure to keep
her on our starboard.

56:51.065 --> 56:51.699
Yes, sir.

56:55.537 --> 56:56.571
Wonderful one.

56:58.239 --> 56:59.274
Sir?

57:01.476 --> 57:04.279
I was part of the wonderful
youth when I was a boy.

57:07.282 --> 57:08.616
I've heard of them, sir.

57:09.484 --> 57:11.052
Good, carry on Lieutenant.

57:11.152 --> 57:11.719
Yes, sir.

57:15.323 --> 57:17.192
Word from
the 10th fleet in the south.

57:17.292 --> 57:18.560
They have just
sunk three U-boats.

57:19.594 --> 57:20.728
What about the north?

57:20.829 --> 57:22.664
- Nothing yet, sir.
- Nothing.

57:23.231 --> 57:24.065
Don't like it.

57:24.799 --> 57:26.067
One could sneak through.

57:27.202 --> 57:29.103
They'll be
closing in. We will find them.

57:45.320 --> 57:48.122
Sir,
engines are performing 100%.

57:48.223 --> 57:50.225
We should be upon
New York Harbor in a day.

57:50.325 --> 57:51.992
Have we heard
from the other U-boats?

57:52.093 --> 57:52.660
No, sir.

57:55.163 --> 57:58.366
How long would it take to
ready us to launch the attack?

57:58.666 --> 58:01.669
Should take five, six hours
to load the missile on deck.

58:03.838 --> 58:05.473
We don't have
time to make mistakes.

58:05.573 --> 58:07.175
We can't make mistakes, sir.

58:08.543 --> 58:10.044
Ships
on the horizon, captain.

58:11.346 --> 58:12.480
Merchant?

58:12.580 --> 58:13.681
They look like Navy ships.

58:15.216 --> 58:17.585
Sir, I have multiple
contacts on the sonar.

58:18.119 --> 58:19.053
They're coming in fast.

58:22.357 --> 58:23.258
Battle stations.

58:23.558 --> 58:25.126
Battle stations!

58:32.767 --> 58:35.370
Ships on our starboard and port.

58:42.377 --> 58:43.778
American warships.

58:43.878 --> 58:45.547
- Have they spotted us?
- Not yet.

58:46.481 --> 58:47.515
Could at any minute.

58:50.318 --> 58:54.255
Load the torpedoes, the
target is the merchant ship.

58:54.355 --> 58:57.158
- We are going to attack?
- Yes, Lieutenant, now go.

58:57.258 --> 58:57.825
Yes, sir.

59:40.902 --> 59:42.737
Torpedoes
await your command, sir.

59:43.771 --> 59:44.839
Port 90 degrees.

59:45.473 --> 59:47.175
Port 90 degrees.

59:47.275 --> 59:48.309
Port 90 degrees, sir.

59:53.881 --> 59:55.717
Loose torpedo number one.

59:57.431 --> 59:58.765
Fire at will!

01:00:03.291 --> 01:00:04.892
Loose torpedo number two.

01:00:04.993 --> 01:00:06.361
Loose torpedo number two.

01:00:06.461 --> 01:00:07.662
- Fire!
- Fire!

01:00:11.466 --> 01:00:12.734
Ready tubes three and four.

01:00:12.834 --> 01:00:13.901
Ready tubes three and four.

01:00:21.275 --> 01:00:22.677
1,000 meters.

01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:27.315
800 meters,

01:00:33.788 --> 01:00:34.622
400 meters,

01:00:38.359 --> 01:00:39.193
300 meters.

01:00:56.344 --> 01:00:57.378
200.

01:01:06.721 --> 01:01:07.755
100 meters.

01:01:20.702 --> 01:01:21.703
Impact, now.

01:01:26.874 --> 01:01:27.709
Hit on one.

01:01:34.549 --> 01:01:35.683
Hit on two.

01:01:41.856 --> 01:01:43.391
What are the Americans doing?

01:01:43.491 --> 01:01:45.493
The ships are heading
towards the merchant vessel.

01:01:46.928 --> 01:01:47.762
On our starboard.

01:01:53.701 --> 01:01:55.737
We can't let them spot us. Go.

01:02:02.077 --> 01:02:03.845
American destroyer
is still approaching.

01:02:09.051 --> 01:02:10.785
We will hit her.
Periscope depth.

01:02:12.587 --> 01:02:14.689
Yes, sir.
Periscope depth!

01:02:14.789 --> 01:02:16.691
Periscope depth.
Ollie, two degrees.

01:02:23.098 --> 01:02:25.533
Mark right,
two knots. Full rudder.

01:02:25.633 --> 01:02:26.567
Yes, sir.

01:02:27.735 --> 01:02:29.604
Mark right two knots,
full rudder.

01:02:33.041 --> 01:02:34.475
Loose torpedo number three.

01:02:35.710 --> 01:02:36.544
<font color="#32D838"> <i>Fire number three.</i> </font>

01:02:40.048 --> 01:02:41.449
Loose torpedo number four.

<font color="#32D838"> <i>Fire number four.</i> </font>

01:02:56.898 --> 01:02:57.832
It should have hit by now.

01:02:58.966 --> 01:02:59.967
We still have one more.

01:03:23.125 --> 01:03:26.327
- Ah, hit on four!
- Hit on four!

01:03:28.030 --> 01:03:29.997
Take it down to
150 meters, four knots.

01:03:30.731 --> 01:03:31.766
Now we run.

01:03:42.844 --> 01:03:45.012
Any news from the 10th?

01:03:45.113 --> 01:03:46.747
A merchant vessel
was in the vicinity when they arrived.

01:03:46.848 --> 01:03:48.482
What else?

01:03:48.583 --> 01:03:50.718
One of our destroyers,
The Cole, was hit and sunk.

01:03:51.419 --> 01:03:53.121
The 10th is
conducting rescue operations.

01:03:55.556 --> 01:03:58.126
Tomorrow morning, New York
may wake up to German rockets.

01:04:00.195 --> 01:04:02.930
I want you to move the entire
southern force to the New York Harbor.

01:04:03.031 --> 01:04:04.832
Can't take any chances.

01:04:04.932 --> 01:04:09.704
Haskell, I want the U-boat
found, no more mistakes.

01:04:10.872 --> 01:04:11.906
Yes, sir.

01:04:37.598 --> 01:04:38.733
Make sure this goes to command.

01:04:39.934 --> 01:04:40.968

It is a message from Kessler.

01:06:08.123 --> 01:06:09.757
He's almost upon New York.

01:06:10.825 --> 01:06:12.260
Does he know?

01:06:12.361 --> 01:06:14.129
If he doesn't,
he will soon enough.

01:06:16.831 --> 01:06:19.101
How did you choose a man
like Kessler for this mission?

01:06:21.002 --> 01:06:22.536
Kessler has lost everything.

01:06:25.207 --> 01:06:28.176
What better for
command than a man

01:06:28.276 --> 01:06:29.710
that does not
have anything to lose?

01:06:31.812 --> 01:06:32.646
Heil Hitler.

01:06:58.973 --> 01:07:00.941
Sir, we're here.

01:07:01.043 --> 01:07:02.009
New York.

01:07:03.245 --> 01:07:06.814
Lieutenant Lutz, you've done
a fine job on this mission.

01:07:06.914 --> 01:07:07.715
Fine job, indeed.

01:07:08.816 --> 01:07:11.153
Thank you, sir.

01:07:30.771 --> 01:07:31.872

quite a sight up there.

01:07:33.641 --> 01:07:34.276
New York City.

01:07:38.213 --> 01:07:39.214
Permission granted.

01:08:03.871 --> 01:08:06.174

The beginning of the war.

We follow our orders.

01:08:33.268 --> 01:08:35.303
Hey Reinhart, hang on to this.

Admiral Donitz, general
orders to stand down.

Await further instructions.

01:09:15.176 --> 01:09:17.279
- Does the crew know?
- Not yet.

01:09:18.113 --> 01:09:19.381
Is it true?

01:09:19.481 --> 01:09:21.049
- Hitler dead?
- Must be true.

01:09:22.350 --> 01:09:23.089
Propaganda.

01:09:23.113 --> 01:09:25.353
American propaganda
is not like our propaganda.

01:09:26.020 --> 01:09:27.189
What do we do?

01:09:34.162 --> 01:09:36.198
Have the men
assemble the rocket.

01:09:36.430 --> 01:09:37.932
But the Admiral, he said...

01:09:38.033 --> 01:09:40.068
Hold and await
further instructions.

01:09:40.167 --> 01:09:42.304
We may only get one
chance. I want to be ready.

01:09:43.837 --> 01:09:45.439
If we work the men in shifts,
we can assemble it faster.

01:09:46.041 --> 01:09:47.142
I will see it is done.

01:09:48.008 --> 01:09:50.045
This is our chance.
We will be ready.

01:09:50.145 --> 01:09:50.911
Yes, sir.

01:09:54.382 --> 01:09:56.084
This is the captain, hear this.

01:09:57.319 --> 01:09:59.054
We're at the gates of our enemy.

01:10:01.021 --> 01:10:02.224
We will prepare to attack.

01:10:09.030 --> 01:10:10.065
Oh, thanks.

01:10:11.799 --> 01:10:13.435
Nights like these,
we can all use a cup.

01:10:17.972 --> 01:10:18.806
What is it?

01:10:19.174 --> 01:10:20.175
Hitler is dead.

01:10:20.975 --> 01:10:21.875
Just announced.

01:10:29.050 --> 01:10:29.883
War is done.

01:10:31.519 --> 01:10:33.288
- Sir?
- Yeah?

01:10:33.555 --> 01:10:34.389
Kessler.

01:10:35.357 --> 01:10:37.325
What about him?

01:10:37.425 --> 01:10:40.128
His file indicates he lost his
family in the Dresden fire bombings.

01:10:40.228 --> 01:10:41.529
All of them?

01:10:42.063 --> 01:10:42.896
Yes.

01:10:44.566 --> 01:10:45.500
Got nothing to lose.

01:10:47.269 --> 01:10:49.304
He doesn't care about Hitler.
Put the 10th on high alert.

01:10:49.404 --> 01:10:50.372
Sir.

01:11:25.540 --> 01:11:26.441
I miss you.

01:11:37.385 --> 01:11:41.222
Sir, she is ready.

01:11:42.890 --> 01:11:44.559
See the fine work
you've done, Lieutenant.

01:12:00.007 --> 01:12:01.008
Attention!

01:12:03.977 --> 01:12:07.848
Men, each one of
you should be proud

01:12:09.184 --> 01:12:10.452
to call yourself German.

01:12:13.355 --> 01:12:15.223
You're all true Kriegsmarine.

01:12:17.392 --> 01:12:21.596
Sir, we have contact at 8573.

01:12:23.231 --> 01:12:25.567
- Merchant?
- American Navy.

01:12:25.667 --> 01:12:26.867
Sir, they found us.

01:12:33.108 --> 01:12:34.542
Can we fire
the rocket from here?

01:12:35.443 --> 01:12:38.079
We need to get closer to
the shore to fire the rocket.

01:12:38.179 --> 01:12:39.347
We're still too far away.

01:12:46.688 --> 01:12:48.523
Sir, your orders?

01:13:09.043 --> 01:13:11.011
Sir, we have contact.

01:13:11.112 --> 01:13:12.680
- Is it her?
- Yes, sir.

01:13:13.214 --> 01:13:14.582
Sound general quarters.

01:13:14.682 --> 01:13:17.285
General
quarters, general quarters.

01:13:24.024 --> 01:13:24.659
Men.

01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:26.960
Hitler is dead.

01:13:30.765 --> 01:13:32.467
We have two options.

01:13:33.535 --> 01:13:37.138
Surrender or fight.

01:13:47.715 --> 01:13:48.949
We are with you, sir.

01:13:57.325 --> 01:13:58.359
We fight.

01:14:14.075 --> 01:14:16.009
Helmsman,
take the boat 93 degrees,

01:14:16.444 --> 01:14:17.579
six knots.

01:14:17.679 --> 01:14:19.012
Yes, sir.

01:14:19.347 --> 01:14:21.282
- Battle stations.
- Battle stations!

01:14:21.382 --> 01:14:22.450
Battle stations!

01:14:35.797 --> 01:14:38.166
Sir,
they made contact.

01:14:38.666 --> 01:14:39.313
They found her?

01:14:39.337 --> 01:14:41.302
Latest reports had them
closing in on her position.

01:14:41.402 --> 01:14:42.170
Just a matter of time.

01:14:43.571 --> 01:14:46.107
Checkmate. Checkmate!

01:14:50.411 --> 01:14:52.313
Sir, the signal's
getting stronger.

01:14:53.548 --> 01:14:54.382
It's getting closer?

01:14:55.183 --> 01:14:56.484
Sir, it's coming straight at us.

01:15:05.660 --> 01:15:07.428
On this course, we are
going straight into warships.

01:15:07.795 --> 01:15:09.464
Prepare to dive.

01:15:09.564 --> 01:15:10.331
Prepare to dive!

01:15:12.166 --> 01:15:14.402
Keep on this course
through the shallows.

01:15:16.204 --> 01:15:18.339
Sir, on this course
we will split them.

01:15:21.609 --> 01:15:24.145
They cannot fire their depth
charges so close to their own boats.

01:15:25.647 --> 01:15:27.582
Increase speed, eight knots.

01:15:28.383 --> 01:15:30.118
Yes, sir.
Increase speed.

01:15:30.218 --> 01:15:31.653
Increase speed, eight knots.

01:15:37.692 --> 01:15:39.193
- You find her?
- No.

01:15:40.562 --> 01:15:41.796
It appears to be attacking.

01:15:42.864 --> 01:15:44.299
What? How?

01:15:58.813 --> 01:16:01.249
Captain, the U-boat's
coming up alongside us, sir.

01:16:03.451 --> 01:16:04.552
Get on the surface guns.

01:16:05.219 --> 01:16:06.521
Yes, sir.

01:16:06.621 --> 01:16:07.722
You heard him, get on the
surface guns, let's go.

01:16:26.641 --> 01:16:28.476
Captain,
the guns aren't long enough.

01:16:29.811 --> 01:16:32.146
Sir, she's going to get away.

01:16:33.448 --> 01:16:34.382
I don't think so.

01:16:38.953 --> 01:16:40.388
Sir, we are clear.

01:16:45.326 --> 01:16:48.262
Sir, there are
more ships on the sonar.

01:17:01.809 --> 01:17:03.611
Captain, the rest of
the 10th has arrived.

01:17:05.246 --> 01:17:05.880
Right on cue.

01:17:07.448 --> 01:17:08.249
How much closer?

01:17:08.850 --> 01:17:09.884
We should be in range.

01:17:10.485 --> 01:17:12.153
We take
our chances on the surface.

01:17:12.253 --> 01:17:13.321
Blow the ballast.

01:17:13.421 --> 01:17:14.756
Yes, sir.
Blow the ballast!

01:17:14.856 --> 01:17:15.623
Blow the ballast!

01:17:31.005 --> 01:17:34.342
Captain, the sub.
It has surfaced.

01:17:34.442 --> 01:17:36.244
What? Attacking?

01:17:36.344 --> 01:17:36.911
Come see.

01:17:43.551 --> 01:17:44.218
Is it attacking?

01:17:45.687 --> 01:17:47.288
I think it's about to fire.

01:17:47.388 --> 01:17:47.955
Fire what?

01:17:48.489 --> 01:17:49.524
It's a rocket.

01:17:51.526 --> 01:17:54.295
All due respect, sir, I wanna
see my mom again after this war.

01:17:55.863 --> 01:17:57.365
I'll get you home
to your mother.

01:18:15.450 --> 01:18:16.484
Sir.

01:18:28.796 --> 01:18:32.734
General orders to all
U-boats, cease operations.

01:18:33.901 --> 01:18:36.337
Stand down, stand down.

01:18:39.941 --> 01:18:40.775
We are too late.

01:18:48.883 --> 01:18:50.785
Sir, the sub has surfaced.

01:18:51.686 --> 01:18:52.787
The 10th is waiting
for your orders.

01:18:54.522 --> 01:18:55.590
What do you wanna do?

01:18:58.860 --> 01:18:59.927
Blow it out of the water.

01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:08.462
Sir. Sir,
we have to abandon ship.

01:20:08.663 --> 01:20:09.797
Get the men out.

01:20:11.599 --> 01:20:12.433
Captain.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:13.835
Come on, Captain.

01:20:17.772 --> 01:20:19.874
Captain goes down with his ship.

01:20:21.542 --> 01:20:22.510
It's my duty.

01:20:24.679 --> 01:20:27.548
Now go. Go!

01:20:32.787 --> 01:20:33.921
