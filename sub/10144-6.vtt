00:22.820 --> 00:24.210
Let's go.

00:38.110 --> 00:39.710
You're
not my target.

00:44.280 --> 00:45.840
Is there anyone
else with you?

00:47.960 --> 00:49.040
Answer me!

00:51.180 --> 00:52.230
No.

00:59.140 --> 01:00.670
I know what
you're doing.

01:01.720 --> 01:03.920
I was trying to
do the same thing--

01:03.920 --> 01:06.040
depersonalize
at all times.

01:06.620 --> 01:08.500
They're not
real people.

01:09.200 --> 01:12.090
Your target's name
is Peter Evans.

01:12.710 --> 01:14.350
He's a grandfather.

01:15.990 --> 01:17.720
He's here to save his
family, all right?

01:17.990 --> 01:19.560
Not threaten Israel.

01:22.500 --> 01:23.660
What do you know?

01:23.660 --> 01:26.160
I know that you don't
have to kill him to end it.

01:26.170 --> 01:28.440
Just need to rescue
some hostages.

01:30.010 --> 01:31.960
Will you do that
with me?

01:35.110 --> 01:36.200
No.

01:37.770 --> 01:39.780
It might help you
sleep better at night.

01:41.550 --> 01:44.720
I sleep fine.
Thank you.

02:09.979 --> 02:11.200
Fuck, no!

04:01.800 --> 04:04.050
- Stonebridge, are you all right?
- Yeah.

04:04.070 --> 04:06.700
Evans--where is he?
Is he safe?

04:06.700 --> 04:08.250
There was an ambush.

04:08.510 --> 04:09.970
Where's Evans?

04:11.550 --> 04:13.480
Jesus.
Get in the car.

04:17.880 --> 04:18.959
Go!

04:23.960 --> 04:24.960
Move.

04:29.900 --> 04:32.660
This is from a CCTV camera
near the exfil point.

04:33.300 --> 04:36.400
We tried tracking where they went,
but there was insufficient coverage.

04:37.120 --> 04:40.650
I mean, you should have just let
Mossad kill him rather than lose him like this.

04:42.120 --> 04:44.200
And how the hell did
they get a tracker on you?

04:44.700 --> 04:46.140
I don't know, ma'am.

04:46.630 --> 04:47.680
It must have been
at the airport,

04:47.690 --> 04:49.710
but they could have got
one on you, Michael...

04:49.710 --> 04:53.720
We sweep this place every day.
We are clean.

04:53.770 --> 04:55.280
- I'm fine.
- Michael, you need to rest.

04:55.280 --> 04:56.530
Yeah, but that's not
true, is it?

04:56.530 --> 04:58.620
We have to find Matlock and his
men and take them all out.

04:58.620 --> 05:02.020
I will decide who the target is and
when you are fit for duty.

05:03.270 --> 05:04.590
Yes, ma'am.

05:06.390 --> 05:09.330
Now, if Knox needs Evans,
it can only be to build a bomb.

05:11.260 --> 05:14.890
We need to find out exactly what
he is planning and shut it down fast.

05:15.540 --> 05:19.500
Coldfall Ridge research facility

05:51.450 --> 05:54.870
Mr. Evans.
Conrad Knox. Welcome.

05:55.440 --> 05:58.150
Your delayed arrival has
upset our schedule somewhat,

05:58.150 --> 06:00.340
but I'm sure
we'll catch up. Please.

06:00.340 --> 06:03.500
I'm not going anywhere until
I've seen my daughter and my grandson.

06:03.930 --> 06:05.510
I want to know
they're ok.

06:06.710 --> 06:08.340
Well, then follow me.

06:13.620 --> 06:16.050
Your son-in-law's
death was a tragedy.

06:16.180 --> 06:19.140
It was a terrible mistake that
should never have happened,

06:19.320 --> 06:23.280
but rest assured I'll do everything
in my power to make amends.

06:23.580 --> 06:25.600
New house,
the finest schools--

06:25.720 --> 06:28.110
Melissa and Harry will
want for nothing.

06:28.330 --> 06:30.760
Apart from a husband
and a father.

06:31.940 --> 06:34.570
All revolutions
have their martyrs.

06:35.410 --> 06:37.870
We need to look
forward, not back...

06:38.140 --> 06:40.700
Make David's sacrifice
worthwhile.

06:41.330 --> 06:43.530
You'll understand
soon enough.

06:43.530 --> 06:45.350
What we're about to
achieve is something

06:45.350 --> 06:47.692
you will be proud to
have been part of.

06:50.580 --> 06:52.640
- Harry!
- Granddad!

06:56.650 --> 06:58.570
- Dad.
- Oh, sweetheart.

07:00.380 --> 07:01.520
- 30 minutes.
- Yes.

07:16.500 --> 07:20.655
You, uh--you didn't get tagged
at the airport, did you?

07:22.170 --> 07:23.170
No.

07:25.160 --> 07:26.480
I fucked up, Mike.

07:30.300 --> 07:32.950
I ran into that Mossad
chick in a bar.

07:36.240 --> 07:37.580
I fucked up, too.

07:38.420 --> 07:39.450
How?

07:41.150 --> 07:42.680
I saw Hanson.

07:43.350 --> 07:45.970
I saw him, and I just left Evans
like he didn't even exist.

07:45.970 --> 07:47.710
I just fucking
left him there, mate.

07:52.540 --> 07:55.800
- About Hanson...
- Huh?

07:56.270 --> 07:57.700
I knew he was here.

07:58.600 --> 07:59.830
You what?

08:01.500 --> 08:04.750
Richmond flagged him
after some bar fight.

08:04.860 --> 08:08.280
Mike, she gave me
the heads-up.

08:08.280 --> 08:10.650
When were you fucking
gonna tell me this, huh?

08:12.560 --> 08:13.780
Don't know.

08:15.300 --> 08:16.700
I didn't know
how you'd react.

08:16.710 --> 08:19.130
Yeah, well, if I'd have known beforehand,
I'd have handled it better, Scott.

08:19.130 --> 08:21.920
What, "We're gonna find Matlock
and take care of his whole crew"?

08:22.330 --> 08:23.360
That's you
handling it?

08:23.360 --> 08:25.910
Who the fuck are you to tell me
what I can and can't know, huh?

08:27.910 --> 08:30.850
So what happens when
we go kicking down doors and you see him?

08:33.370 --> 08:34.630
I'm fine.

08:35.289 --> 08:37.299
The mission--
it always comes first.

08:37.559 --> 08:40.169
Hanson--he's just
a bonus, yeah?

08:40.169 --> 08:41.750
You've got to
trust me.

08:47.388 --> 08:51.037
- You need to get to a phone and tell someone
what's happening. - I will.

08:51.880 --> 08:54.580
I'm just playing
them along till then.

08:55.240 --> 08:57.130
What does he
want from you?

09:00.010 --> 09:01.900
How have they been
treating you?

09:03.130 --> 09:05.700
We get moved around
a lot, but yes,

09:05.780 --> 09:08.720
Harry has been given more
toys than he can play with.

09:13.370 --> 09:15.270
I haven't told
him...

09:16.270 --> 09:17.900
about David.

09:20.330 --> 09:22.060
I just said...

09:23.130 --> 09:26.910
that he's been hurt and he won't be
joining us yet.

09:28.630 --> 09:31.600
Time's up. Sorry.

09:35.370 --> 09:36.740
Mossad
on the phone.

09:37.110 --> 09:38.330
- I'll take it up there.
- Ok.

09:38.330 --> 09:41.050
- You two, go home
and get some rest - Yeah.

09:41.050 --> 09:42.390
Dalton.

09:44.420 --> 09:47.800
They serve themselves
and the corporate--

09:47.990 --> 09:50.470
Here's some more information
on the Conrad Knox Foundation.

09:50.470 --> 09:51.820
Cheers.

09:52.600 --> 09:55.250
Is this you proving how on
mission you are, Michael?

09:55.250 --> 09:59.120
Well, if I'm confined to desk duties,
might as well make the hours count.

09:59.520 --> 10:01.390
- You coming for a beer?
- No, thanks.

10:01.540 --> 10:02.570
You?

10:05.900 --> 10:08.080
Michael, is there
anything else you need?

10:10.390 --> 10:13.170
Just a heads-up on the man who
murdered my wife next time.

10:23.080 --> 10:26.790
Every weapon we destroy
sends a message.

10:27.390 --> 10:29.680
It says "Have faith."

10:29.740 --> 10:30.470
It says "We're winning"--

10:30.500 --> 10:34.480
not to the warlords
but to the people.

10:35.220 --> 10:37.280
It says "Believe."

10:51.470 --> 10:52.670
It's open.

11:04.400 --> 11:05.860
Trouble sleeping?

11:11.020 --> 11:12.610
You've lost Evans.

11:13.030 --> 11:16.530
Your boss has told mine Section 20
won't protect him anymore.

11:16.790 --> 11:18.550
He's an open target.

11:20.240 --> 11:22.060
So, what are you
doing here, then?

12:17.090 --> 12:21.205
Disease is the biggest factor inhibiting
the development of this continent.

12:22.300 --> 12:25.980
But with the vaccines
that these laboratories produce,

12:25.990 --> 12:29.940
we can start to put every
African nation back on its feet.

12:36.450 --> 12:40.650
<i>Conrad Knox, 15-12-53.</i>

12:40.650 --> 12:43.483
<i>Cleared for access
level -35.</i>

12:43.483 --> 12:45.500
You were let down,
Peter...

12:45.790 --> 12:49.460
By men who had neither your
vision nor your principles.

12:49.480 --> 12:53.145
And now you have
the opportunity to rewrite history..

12:53.145 --> 12:56.810
<i>Doors opening, level -35.</i>

12:56.810 --> 12:59.700
<i>You are entering
a restricted area.</i>

13:09.370 --> 13:11.270
Your life's work...

13:13.340 --> 13:16.950
Hidden away by a couple of
apartheid ministers...

13:17.610 --> 13:19.270
Now ready to atone for

13:19.270 --> 13:22.190
the sins
of that vile regime.

13:29.870 --> 13:33.730
Now... with this,

13:34.980 --> 13:40.220
and your help,
we can liberate this continent

13:40.820 --> 13:45.110
and raise Africa to a point where its
voice is not just heard,

13:45.130 --> 13:49.110
but listened to
all over the world.

14:04.690 --> 14:06.850
You still think
I'm using you.

14:08.050 --> 14:09.810
To get to Evans?

14:11.990 --> 14:13.940
I don't care if you are.

14:15.240 --> 14:16.970
We don't know
where he is.

14:18.320 --> 14:23.000
So the best way
to stop him is to rescue his family.

14:23.790 --> 14:26.080
Except you don't know
where they are, either.

14:27.520 --> 14:30.070
Yeah, you got me there.

14:33.010 --> 14:35.520
Why didn't they send you
after Knox?

14:36.340 --> 14:38.280
He's our key target.

14:38.690 --> 14:40.910
Maybe they will.

14:41.940 --> 14:44.390
There's always
one more person to kill.

14:48.730 --> 14:50.730
You could just walk away.

14:52.860 --> 14:54.200
Disappear.

14:55.250 --> 14:58.720
They can't hand you
that next file if they can't find you.

15:04.750 --> 15:05.810
What?

15:08.160 --> 15:10.860
Did you ever put your
gun in your own mouth?

15:16.820 --> 15:19.020
That's the day
you should quit.

15:19.500 --> 15:21.230
It's our mess.

15:21.960 --> 15:23.900
We helped build
those weapons.

15:23.900 --> 15:25.660
It's not your mess.

15:30.270 --> 15:33.890
- Walk away.
- To where?

15:36.360 --> 15:38.650
Promise me
you'll try.

15:53.310 --> 15:54.700
For Evans.

15:56.210 --> 15:58.480
He needs to examine
one to make sure

15:58.480 --> 16:00.312
the technology
is compatible,

16:00.312 --> 16:03.661
but I want them back, and
the other components

16:03.661 --> 16:05.942
transported out as
soon as he's ready.

16:10.136 --> 16:13.781
- Well, we've got a bird on standby
to start the evac. - Just be careful.

16:14.130 --> 16:16.710
The first load has been
moved from the vaults already.

16:19.790 --> 16:21.090
Sir...

16:22.400 --> 16:26.380
I strongly recommend you move
your own departure date forward as well.

16:26.960 --> 16:30.150
We're not just dealing
with 20 anymore.

16:30.150 --> 16:32.380
Mossad's a whole new ball game.

16:32.550 --> 16:36.970
We can't assume that they're
not aware of your involvement also.

16:41.180 --> 16:42.940
If that is the case,

16:43.600 --> 16:46.250
then their failure to kill Evans
only increases the chance

16:46.250 --> 16:49.220
that you or your daughter will
become their primary target.

16:50.990 --> 16:54.150
We need to shut down
and move on as soon as possible.

16:54.880 --> 16:57.550
Let Evans finish
the tests at the new location.

17:00.410 --> 17:04.606
I don't act according to other people's agendas.
They defer to mine.

17:07.829 --> 17:12.248
If there's a security  risk, it's your job
to neutralize that situation.

17:14.281 --> 17:16.030
Uh-uh.
Don't do it.

17:17.349 --> 17:18.710
Relax.

17:18.880 --> 17:20.869
I'm not here
to kill anyone.

17:24.740 --> 17:26.470
Craig Hanson,
Mr. Knox.

17:26.480 --> 17:27.770
Ex-SAS.

17:28.339 --> 17:31.300
I believe I've highlighted
a problem in your security.

17:32.250 --> 17:34.030
He's not
a team player.

17:34.030 --> 17:36.450
I'm not interested
in camaraderie.

17:36.450 --> 17:37.980
I want protection,

17:37.980 --> 17:41.280
especially when I'm holding
a case of nuclear triggers.

17:41.510 --> 17:43.980
We can't use him.
He's a known fugitive.

17:44.730 --> 17:46.720
He killed the wife
of a Section 20 operative

17:46.720 --> 17:48.840
who's now pathologically
gunning for him.

17:48.840 --> 17:51.620
Isn't that precisely
how you got Evans back?

17:51.770 --> 17:53.480
He's unbalanced.

17:53.480 --> 17:57.870
He took out the whole
of your security detail single-handedly.

17:58.410 --> 18:00.030
Hire him.

18:17.010 --> 18:19.570
Miss Knox. My name is
Michael Stonebridge--

18:19.570 --> 18:20.920
Victor, relax.

18:21.050 --> 18:22.450
May I have a word?

18:23.040 --> 18:24.100
I'm sorry.

18:24.200 --> 18:26.210
You'll have to contact my PA,
make an appointment.

18:26.210 --> 18:27.820
Yes, but that won't
benefit your fundraiser,

18:27.820 --> 18:30.160
which is why I thought
I'd talk to you direct.

18:31.660 --> 18:32.660
Sorry.

18:34.050 --> 18:36.160
I'm an active soldier
in the British Military.

18:36.160 --> 18:39.120
I fought in Sierra Leone,
Rwanda, Sudan.

18:39.120 --> 18:40.990
I've been injured
several times.

18:41.880 --> 18:45.090
Look, I think your
decommissioning program is

18:45.090 --> 18:48.950
the single biggest step towards peace
that this continent has ever witnessed.

18:49.480 --> 18:50.540
If you think it would be
helpful,

18:50.540 --> 18:53.650
it would be my honor to tell all of your
guests just that.

18:59.800 --> 19:02.580
Come on. Help me
find this fucking thing.

19:03.340 --> 19:06.230
Scott, a word.

19:27.380 --> 19:29.360
You missed the ones
of us fucking.

19:29.870 --> 19:32.840
She's a Mossad agent.
An assassin.

19:32.850 --> 19:35.700
Yeah, who wants
to quit.

19:35.700 --> 19:37.210
And if she does,
then Evans lives.

19:37.210 --> 19:39.860
Interesting, because you're the reason
we lost Evans in the first place.

19:39.870 --> 19:41.760
You are a liability,
Scott.

19:41.760 --> 19:44.700
I made a mistake,
all right? It happens.

19:44.700 --> 19:46.840
If you want to can my ass,
then go right ahead.

19:46.850 --> 19:48.190
Let's see how well you
do without me.

19:48.190 --> 19:49.670
Well, it could hardly
get any worse.

19:49.680 --> 19:52.510
No, it fucking couldn't, because
right now we got nothing.

19:52.580 --> 19:54.890
We got no leads,
no ideas.

19:54.890 --> 19:57.760
Knox is running rings around
you, and I'm the liability?

19:57.760 --> 19:58.830
Back up, soldier.

19:58.840 --> 20:01.440
Fuck that. I've given this unit
everything, including Curtis.

20:01.440 --> 20:02.340
You remember him?

20:02.340 --> 20:04.590
We chewed him up and just
spat him out, didn't we?

20:04.590 --> 20:05.930
And for what?

20:05.940 --> 20:07.830
For fucking nothing.

20:09.130 --> 20:11.610
Is that what we're all
worth to you, too?

20:12.910 --> 20:15.310
- It's all any of us are worth.
- Yeah.

20:15.610 --> 20:18.160
So don't kid yourself
that it's any different.

20:20.350 --> 20:24.020
Now let's cut the sob story, shall we,
and get on with the job at hand?

20:24.490 --> 20:27.040
And what job would that
be, exactly, ma'am?

20:28.920 --> 20:32.400
There's a new shipment of weapons
arriving from Sierra Leone.

20:32.710 --> 20:35.400
More decommissioned arms
for the Conrad Knox Foundation.

20:35.400 --> 20:38.630
I would like you, Richmond, and
Baxter to follow the trucks

20:38.630 --> 20:40.670
in case any get
diverted en route.

20:41.280 --> 20:43.290
- Fine.
- Thank you.

20:49.671 --> 20:52.650
- Great work.
- Thank you so much for coming.

20:53.480 --> 20:55.220
Thank you.
It's lovely to talk to you.

20:56.120 --> 20:57.850
Thank you. Cheers.

21:00.120 --> 21:03.330
- You're quite the hit for
a gate-crasher. - Yes, well...

21:04.330 --> 21:06.940
I've had 3 pledges
of support already.

21:07.150 --> 21:09.140
I may have to
use you again.

21:10.490 --> 21:13.110
- My wife would love it here.
- Oh, you're married?

21:14.180 --> 21:15.900
She was shot
and killed.

21:16.940 --> 21:20.050
It's just another reason why what
you're doing is so important to me,

21:20.130 --> 21:21.510
why I want to help.

21:21.510 --> 21:23.330
- Great speech.
- Thank you.

21:23.750 --> 21:25.720
You know, it's
ironic, isn't it?

21:26.460 --> 21:28.210
Here you are, trying to
make this country safe,

21:28.210 --> 21:30.290
and yet you need armed
guards to do it.

21:30.630 --> 21:33.890
- That's my father's choice,
not mine. - Really?

21:33.910 --> 21:36.350
And what makes him think
you're in such danger?

21:36.530 --> 21:38.350
It's just
a precaution.

21:45.340 --> 21:47.770
Whoa. Two trucks
just diverted.

21:47.770 --> 21:49.950
They're no longer headed to
the decommissioning site.

21:49.950 --> 21:52.620
That road leads
to the docks.

21:52.620 --> 21:54.940
- Bravo team in pursuit.
- Roger that.

21:55.390 --> 21:56.160
Text Stonebridge.

21:56.160 --> 21:59.110
I want him updated on all
details as soon as they happen.

22:01.190 --> 22:04.430
<i>The foundation has actually
been running for 8 years.</i>

22:04.490 --> 22:09.510
<i>My father's biggest
fundraising event to date--</i>

22:09.520 --> 22:12.970
Excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt.
Might I have a word?

22:13.100 --> 22:15.790
Uh, yes. Thank you.

22:18.500 --> 22:20.620
The convoy
of arms from Sierra Leone--

22:21.000 --> 22:23.380
are they all going to the same
depot to be decommissioned?

22:23.380 --> 22:25.200
Yes, of course.

22:25.260 --> 22:27.040
They should be
on their way now.

22:28.190 --> 22:29.820
How do you know that?

22:30.810 --> 22:33.800
I'm working with British
Military Intelligence.

22:33.900 --> 22:36.830
We have growing evidence that large
quantities of the foundation's weapons

22:36.831 --> 22:39.220
are in fact being
secretly stockpiled.

22:39.220 --> 22:40.390
What?

22:41.890 --> 22:45.730
The weapons from Rwanda
were never destroyed.

22:45.910 --> 22:47.350
This handgun was used
in a shootout

22:47.360 --> 22:48.970
at the Cape Town Airport
3 days ago.

22:48.970 --> 22:50.220
That's impossible.

22:50.220 --> 22:52.490
We think by this man--

22:52.490 --> 22:53.710
Karl Matlock.

22:53.710 --> 22:55.230
You ever seen him before?

22:56.410 --> 22:58.110
No, I haven't.

22:58.110 --> 23:01.670
What about your father?
Do you think he'd recognize him?

23:03.110 --> 23:04.720
You'd need to ask
him yourself.

23:04.720 --> 23:07.270
Miss Knox, I want to protect
what the foundation stands for,

23:07.270 --> 23:09.390
not just bring down
the people corrupting it.

23:10.360 --> 23:11.800
What people?

23:13.910 --> 23:18.080
Cape Town docks, South Africa

23:24.130 --> 23:28.750
At the port, Duncan
Dock, yard 3.

23:28.780 --> 23:30.830
I want you to
sit tight and observe.

23:30.830 --> 23:34.228
We'll contact the South African Police,
let them make the arrests.

23:34.230 --> 23:35.580
Copy that.

23:35.730 --> 23:39.600
There's the money shot.
Got that one, Baxter?

23:48.230 --> 23:49.910
Is there any sign
of Matlock?

23:50.450 --> 23:52.930
Negative.
He's not with the escort.

23:56.790 --> 24:00.410
The girl's there, though.
The sniper.

24:00.730 --> 24:03.190
These pictures are live from my unit's
location.

24:03.900 --> 24:06.380
Those are your weapons
getting ready for shipping.

24:08.440 --> 24:10.640
Well, then,
I'll contact the police.

24:10.640 --> 24:14.330
They're already on their way,
but they'll not catch their main target.

24:14.340 --> 24:17.650
- This Matlock?
- Or who he's working for.

24:19.430 --> 24:21.210
2 o'clock.

24:21.450 --> 24:23.310
That's Craig Hanson.

24:32.600 --> 24:35.320
Hanson match.
Stonebridge?

24:35.330 --> 24:37.100
Let's hold on that one.

24:37.530 --> 24:39.470
It's not relevant
to his task.

24:39.900 --> 24:42.360
Like I said, you should really ask your
father if he knows him.

24:42.370 --> 24:44.125
- Are you accusing my father--
- And why he's using

24:44.130 --> 24:46.890
your decommissioning program to build
his own private mercenary army.

24:46.891 --> 24:49.670
- Get out. - These aren't the only weapons
that your father is stockpiling.

24:49.680 --> 24:51.830
- Oh, really?
- He also has a set of nuclear triggers,

24:51.835 --> 24:55.539
and he's forcing an ex-nuclear scientist
by the name of Peter Evans to work for him.

24:55.540 --> 24:57.880
He's doing this by kidnapping
and murdering his family.

24:57.890 --> 25:00.620
I said get out.

25:16.660 --> 25:18.800
<i>Load the box.</i>

25:23.500 --> 25:25.230
<i>What's happening?</i>

25:25.260 --> 25:27.530
Looks like
something is going on.

25:27.560 --> 25:29.130
Hanson! Hart!

25:29.160 --> 25:30.100
Wrap it up!

25:30.130 --> 25:32.000
Let's go!

25:32.630 --> 25:34.600
Yeah.
They're leaving.

25:35.310 --> 25:37.880
- Come on! - Zero, where are
these fucking cops?

25:37.920 --> 25:40.830
Stop them leaving.
No bodies.

25:41.150 --> 25:45.020
Bravo 3, that gas tank on
your 1 o'clock-- light it up.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.560
Run!

26:01.600 --> 26:04.360
Run!

26:04.430 --> 26:05.860
<i>Get them!</i>

26:07.680 --> 26:08.900
Shit.

26:24.990 --> 26:26.330
Fuck.

26:34.850 --> 26:36.230
Around the back!
Over there.

26:37.030 --> 26:38.560
Move, move, move.

26:51.680 --> 26:54.020
- Don't move! Put your hands in the air!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no, no.

26:54.050 --> 26:56.590
- I'm the good guy. - Stop right there!
Put your hands in the air!

26:56.600 --> 26:59.130
- That's the bad guy, all right? That's the bad guy.
- You're under arrest.

26:59.160 --> 27:00.950
- That's the fugitive.
- You don't say a word.

27:00.951 --> 27:02.560
Do you understand?
I'm the one that called it in.

27:02.600 --> 27:05.360
- Scott, what's going on?
- All right, all right. You got it wrong.

27:07.060 --> 27:09.860
I'm the one that called it in.
For fuck's sake.

27:09.900 --> 27:12.460
Bravo 2, report. Over.

27:12.500 --> 27:14.530
Bravo 2, report!

27:17.600 --> 27:21.600
We're taking the first payload now.
Clean elements only.

27:21.630 --> 27:25.360
He's still doing tests on the uranium,
but he's finished with the triggers.

27:25.390 --> 27:27.460
- You want me to load them?
- No.

27:27.500 --> 27:30.140
I want them to hand,
just in case.

27:30.170 --> 27:32.600
And don't bring them
yourself.

27:32.630 --> 27:35.390
I need you and Hanson
to remain at the facility.

27:36.390 --> 27:38.360
Ava's been approached by 20,

27:38.880 --> 27:40.540
<i>{\an8}Park shoting kills 
British Soldier's wife</i>

27:38.400 --> 27:42.030
and he's asking some very
awkward questions.

27:44.520 --> 27:46.520
<i>{\an8}British Soldier's wife
slain in local park</i>

27:47.500 --> 27:51.140
And next time,
please ensure

27:51.140 --> 27:55.830
that her security detail
is as good at their job as this Stonebridge.

28:01.250 --> 28:02.870
Tungsten-
carbide bricks.

28:02.910 --> 28:06.470
Probably won't use them, but I'll need them
for backup for the beryllium reflectors.

28:06.510 --> 28:07.510
Just fucking load it.

28:09.910 --> 28:11.750
And keep the triggers.

28:28.470 --> 28:30.350
What the hell
is going on?

28:30.380 --> 28:34.000
I demand you to leave these premises
and release my men immediately.

28:34.230 --> 28:38.000
They will be returned
to your shortly,

28:38.050 --> 28:41.200
subject to you ceasing all operations
in this country with immediate effect.

28:41.230 --> 28:42.860
You want us to
leave?

28:42.880 --> 28:46.000
You have overstepped your
jurisdiction,

28:46.030 --> 28:51.030
interfering with and willfully damaging
a police investigation into arms smuggling.

28:51.100 --> 28:54.060
We were the ones who gave
the police that information.

28:54.100 --> 28:58.630
We have been aware for some time
of a corrupt ring of individuals

28:58.630 --> 29:03.460
within the decommissioning site, and we would
have been able to arrest all the criminals involved

29:03.500 --> 29:08.600
if your premature intervention hadn't alerted
them and given them time to escape.

29:08.630 --> 29:10.960
Where are
the weapons now?

29:11.000 --> 29:14.830
Returned to the Conrad
Knox Foundation, naturally,

29:14.860 --> 29:17.700
so they can be
disposed of as intended.

29:21.701 --> 29:23.701
<i>Man gunned down at home</i>

29:41.900 --> 29:44.000
If I fly off with them, they'll let
you and Harry go.

29:45.030 --> 29:48.900
There's a small fortune waiting for you
in your bank account. I've seen it.

29:48.990 --> 29:50.520
I don't want
his money.

29:51.540 --> 29:56.560
I want David back
and my father.

29:57.150 --> 29:58.740
I'm doing this
for you.

30:00.280 --> 30:02.960
- Are you?
- To keep you safe.

30:03.350 --> 30:05.590
Like the people
this bomb will kill?

30:06.130 --> 30:09.630
I won't make it
viable. I told you that.

30:09.660 --> 30:12.430
I haven't seen you
this alive in years.

30:12.460 --> 30:16.130
Because I'm doing what
I do best, finally.

30:16.160 --> 30:18.260
Have you any idea
what that's like?

30:18.300 --> 30:21.950
Starting again when everything
that you know and love

30:21.950 --> 30:26.200
and worked for has been
snatched away, forgotten?

30:26.230 --> 30:30.660
Yes. I know exactly
what that's like.

31:33.230 --> 31:35.110
So no
bodyguards, huh?

31:36.930 --> 31:38.650
You're here,
aren't you?

31:40.060 --> 31:42.460
I doubt I'd be safer
with anyone else.

31:47.130 --> 31:51.940
Tell me you meant it-- what
you said about the foundation

31:52.000 --> 31:53.960
being too important
to be undermined.

31:54.000 --> 31:58.200
Tell me you do
understand that.

31:58.230 --> 31:59.960
Are you offering me
a deal?

32:00.000 --> 32:03.500
I want to confront my father,

32:03.550 --> 32:06.460
but I won't betray him,

32:06.560 --> 32:09.480
won't destroy what we've
worked so hard to accomplish.

32:11.260 --> 32:14.590
The question is, what
do you want in return?

32:18.800 --> 32:21.060
The nuclear triggers
and Peter Evans.

32:22.630 --> 32:27.100
- We think they're somewhere together.
- Yeah, well, I have no idea where Peter Evans is.

32:27.130 --> 32:30.430
Does your father have any facilities near
here-- warehouses, anything like that?

32:30.460 --> 32:33.630
Um, Oakley, Little Down,
Mercer Street.

32:33.660 --> 32:35.380
Which one is
the most modern?

32:36.630 --> 32:40.500
Little Down or maybe
Coldfall Ridge.

32:40.530 --> 32:42.530
Coldfall Ridge?

32:42.560 --> 32:46.770
The Zulu name is
Imifula Emibidlana--

32:48.530 --> 32:52.440
The Two Rivers Under The Mountain.
Isn't that wonderful?

32:55.600 --> 32:57.050
What?

32:57.400 --> 32:59.051
"Imifula Emibidlana."

32:59.051 --> 33:01.213
That's where Evans said
the nuclear weapons were buried.

33:01.460 --> 33:03.360
Buried, not destroyed.

33:03.400 --> 33:05.900
It was originally the
site of an old military clinic.

33:05.930 --> 33:09.030
Knox bought it 15 years ago
and turned it into a vaccination center.

33:09.060 --> 33:11.620
So if Evans is
right and Knox knows it,

33:11.621 --> 33:13.360
he'd have the bombs
there already.

33:13.400 --> 33:15.360
All he really needed
was the triggers.

33:15.400 --> 33:17.560
And a nuclear scientist
to help rig them.

33:17.600 --> 33:22.230
Hmm. It's heavily fortified. It's guarded,
so yeah, it could very well be the place,

33:22.431 --> 33:24.181
- but how do we prove it?
- We can't.

33:24.480 --> 33:26.700
If we tell the police or any
of the other authorities here,

33:26.740 --> 33:28.960
we run the risk of someone
warning him beforehand.

33:28.961 --> 33:32.050
We could use other channels.
The UN, the IAEA.

33:32.060 --> 33:35.290
- Yeah. That could take months.
- Fuck that. Let's just go in ourselves.

33:36.460 --> 33:38.190
It's our only choice.

33:43.230 --> 33:44.950
That woman
who was here earlier...

33:46.400 --> 33:48.000
Who gave you
that case...

33:49.430 --> 33:54.660
She's wanted by the
police for murder and kidnapping.

34:01.730 --> 34:05.860
I'm assuming
the mother and child

34:06.600 --> 34:10.230
are still safe and will
be properly compensated.

34:10.260 --> 34:13.100
The money has been
transferred already.

34:13.130 --> 34:15.100
Then let them go.

34:16.600 --> 34:18.060
All of them.

34:19.730 --> 34:22.699
Including
Peter Evans.

34:23.530 --> 34:28.000
- Ava, what are you talking about?
- Enough bullshit, dad, ok?

34:29.159 --> 34:31.730
I don't know what the
hell you were planning,

34:33.060 --> 34:34.929
but it stops now.

34:37.199 --> 34:39.630
We give the triggers
back.

34:39.659 --> 34:42.850
We don't build ourselves
a bomb,

34:45.159 --> 34:47.670
and we stop employing
fucking murderers.

35:20.400 --> 35:22.160
Bravo Team, proceed.

35:31.930 --> 35:35.346
- Where are you going?
- Technical fault of some sort.

35:35.350 --> 35:37.500
<i>Repeat, systems overload.</i>

35:44.060 --> 35:45.800
TP, do you read me?
Over.

35:48.800 --> 35:50.900
Security to positions.

35:50.930 --> 35:52.190
TP, report.

35:55.100 --> 35:56.360
<i>System overload.</i>

35:56.361 --> 35:57.729
You two,
check it out.

35:57.730 --> 35:59.460
<i>Security to positions.</i>

35:59.500 --> 36:03.430
- Repeat, security to positions.
- Kohl, I think we may have a problem here.

36:10.060 --> 36:12.630
You know what the first
nuclear bomb was called?

36:15.060 --> 36:16.480
"Little Boy."

36:43.160 --> 36:44.640
Door's locked.

36:48.860 --> 36:51.580
Shit. All right, guess
we'll go around.

37:01.630 --> 37:04.700
The goal remains
a strong Africa,

37:04.730 --> 37:09.060
just as America is strong, and Russia
and China and every other nuclear power.

37:13.730 --> 37:16.160
We do what is necessary.

37:16.200 --> 37:19.600
You can't lead
a revolution by good deeds alone.

37:19.630 --> 37:23.670
I thought you understood.
That's how power works.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.665
<i>The facility will be locked down.</i>

37:26.665 --> 37:30.261
<i>Evacuate immediately.</i>

37:29.300 --> 37:32.060
All our aims
are still the same.

37:32.100 --> 37:35.860
We will still develop, we will still
vaccinate, we will still cure...

37:35.900 --> 37:38.900
And kill and kidnap
and what else--

37:38.930 --> 37:41.500
with our mercenary army
and our nuclear weapons?

37:41.530 --> 37:44.740
Why has the big picture
always eluded you?

37:44.960 --> 37:49.730
Just make that leap.
Embrace the possibilities.

37:50.730 --> 37:53.200
- Yes?
- Sir, we're under attack.

37:53.230 --> 37:57.200
We'll commence evac immediately.
I suggest you do the same.

37:59.260 --> 38:01.500
<i>RV as arranged.</i>

38:03.630 --> 38:05.030
What?

38:10.260 --> 38:11.930
<i>Evacuate immediately.</i>

38:11.970 --> 38:15.100
- Zero, which way is the vault?
- First corridor left, then second right.

38:15.130 --> 38:19.700
That'll take you to the lift area. Scott, watch out
for Stonebridge. He's ahead of you now.

38:19.710 --> 38:22.467
<i>All personnel
must evacuate immediately.</i>

38:22.500 --> 38:23.900
<i>Repeat,
evacuate immediately.</i>

38:24.036 --> 38:25.336
Careful!

38:25.790 --> 38:27.660
It's Stonebridge. Move!

38:36.660 --> 38:38.160
This is not...

38:38.200 --> 38:39.860
Michael!

38:41.560 --> 38:45.300
Michael!
How's the wife?

39:04.560 --> 39:05.930
Mike...

39:07.580 --> 39:10.060
- Which way did they go?
- This way.

39:15.460 --> 39:17.000
Dad, stop it.

39:17.030 --> 39:19.330
Stop this insanity.

39:21.530 --> 39:23.210
I've made a deal.

39:24.660 --> 39:26.570
You betrayed me.

39:27.100 --> 39:29.350
You're the one
who's betrayed me.

39:33.460 --> 39:36.160
Dad, they trust me.

39:36.200 --> 39:38.960
I can use them.
Make sure we survive.

39:39.000 --> 39:42.430
Dad, please don't
walk away.

39:45.060 --> 39:46.630
Please!

39:51.500 --> 39:54.430
I need to see my family.
Make sure they're safe.

39:54.460 --> 39:55.630
No time.

39:55.660 --> 39:58.030
<i>Proceed to safe zones.</i>

39:58.060 --> 40:00.360
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

40:00.400 --> 40:04.460
<i>All personnel proceed
to designated safe zones.</i>

40:17.330 --> 40:18.730
Shit.

40:31.060 --> 40:33.400
Move! Let's go!

40:34.630 --> 40:37.180
Get this
crate on board. Hurry!

40:44.160 --> 40:45.260
Shit.

40:46.530 --> 40:48.560
Hit them!

40:59.650 --> 41:05.630
<i>Repeat. This is not a drill.</i>

41:10.330 --> 41:11.960
<i>Evacuation.</i>

41:12.000 --> 41:16.160
<i>All personnel...</i>

41:17.500 --> 41:18.930
- Ah!
- Richmond!

41:21.930 --> 41:23.930
Now!

41:33.460 --> 41:34.960
Shit.

41:40.630 --> 41:42.060
Hanson!

41:43.330 --> 41:46.310
Right here.
Let's move!

41:46.630 --> 41:49.100
Go, go!

41:52.000 --> 41:53.360
Come on!

41:53.400 --> 41:54.760
Run!

41:54.800 --> 41:56.530
Hanson!

41:56.560 --> 41:57.770
It's Hanson!

41:58.130 --> 42:00.130
Take the shot, buddy!
It's your kill!

42:00.260 --> 42:01.860
Let's move!

42:03.000 --> 42:04.400
Come on!

42:08.160 --> 42:10.260
Come on. Let's move,
move, move!

42:10.300 --> 42:11.800
Take the shot, Michael!

42:11.830 --> 42:13.300
Moving!

42:24.460 --> 42:26.300
Move it up!

42:41.430 --> 42:44.060
He jumped!
Evans fucking jumped!

42:44.100 --> 42:45.430
Fuck.

42:51.560 --> 42:54.470
Zero, we've all got
a clear shot on the tail rotor.

42:56.600 --> 42:57.800
Hold fire.

42:57.830 --> 43:00.830
It's loaded with radioactive materials
and Christ knows what else.

43:00.860 --> 43:02.700
Let it go.

43:09.960 --> 43:13.620
They have nearly 50 kilos
of highly enriched uranium

43:13.630 --> 43:16.580
and enough reflectors
to triple that amount.

43:16.600 --> 43:19.550
Now, they haven't assembled it and
there are still some tests to be done,

43:19.590 --> 43:23.300
but if they still have the triggers,
they can make 4 warheads.

43:23.330 --> 43:25.330
Well, at the very
least, we've delayed him.

43:25.360 --> 43:28.700
I'm going to need a full
debrief of everything you saw.

43:40.200 --> 43:42.030
Come on.

43:42.660 --> 43:43.900
There.

43:51.080 --> 43:53.020
- Come on, mom.
- Up there.

43:59.560 --> 44:00.850
Get down!

44:02.650 --> 44:03.350
Scott!

44:03.380 --> 44:04.510
Got it!

44:04.910 --> 44:06.330
- Dad!
- Scott!

44:06.380 --> 44:07.650
I got it!

44:07.840 --> 44:09.610
In the house.
In the house.

44:11.740 --> 44:13.150
Goddamn it.

44:17.870 --> 44:20.730
Fuck. What the fuck
did you do that for?

44:22.610 --> 44:24.140
This is my way out.

44:24.550 --> 44:26.500
I needed you to kill me.

44:28.710 --> 44:30.630
Fuck, Rebecca.

44:31.540 --> 44:35.280
- You're not gonna die from those wounds.
All right? - Yeah.

44:35.880 --> 44:37.290
You have to
hang on.

44:38.310 --> 44:42.000
You got your out.
You take it.

44:42.030 --> 44:43.000
Ok?

44:44.030 --> 44:47.160
You promise me. Please.

44:47.700 --> 44:54.360
- I promise. - Look, just hold there.
Hold on tight.

44:56.100 --> 44:58.530
You got to get up.

44:58.560 --> 45:00.300
Get out of here.

45:06.660 --> 45:08.660
There's
still no lead on Knox.

45:08.700 --> 45:12.230
They slapped a "D" Notice on everything--
covered up any evidence

45:12.260 --> 45:15.530
that Coldfall Ridge was ever a nuclear
storage facility.

45:15.560 --> 45:16.834
Christ, we don't even know

45:16.834 --> 45:19.303
if that helicopter made it
out of South African airspace.

45:22.030 --> 45:25.400
It's possible the Israelis
have got a track on Knox.

45:25.430 --> 45:27.260
We could get Scott
to intercept.

45:27.300 --> 45:30.760
Mossad picked her up long
before Evans' body went cold.

45:30.800 --> 45:32.060
She's a ghost.

45:32.100 --> 45:35.193
Major, we are about to be deported

45:35.193 --> 45:37.809
for an illegal raid on
a civilian research facility.

45:38.600 --> 45:42.100
- We've got to move.
- Knox has gone dark.

45:44.600 --> 45:46.660
It's time we went dark, too.
