00:29.480 --> 00:30.920
You said you'd
be careful with it.

00:30.920 --> 00:32.840
I was. How was I
supposed to know

00:32.840 --> 00:34.880
my locker was gonna
get broken into?

00:34.880 --> 00:36.880
Are you sure
you locked it?

00:36.880 --> 00:38.560
Of course I locked it.

00:38.560 --> 00:39.920
What's with them?

00:39.920 --> 00:41.920
Kiki loaned Sam
her favorite sweater,

00:41.920 --> 00:43.600
but it got stolen
out of Sam's locker.

00:43.600 --> 00:44.800
I'm sorry, all right?

00:44.800 --> 00:46.480
Sorry doesn't get
my sweater back.

00:46.480 --> 00:49.240
Hey, what's going on?

00:49.960 --> 00:51.360
Oops.

00:51.360 --> 00:52.840
Nice work, graceful.

00:52.840 --> 00:54.200
It was an accident.

00:54.200 --> 00:55.800
Well, you should have looked.

00:55.800 --> 00:56.880
I didn't mean it.

[All arguing]

[Whistles]

01:03.080 --> 01:07.120
Thank you. How about
we all just settle down

01:07.120 --> 01:08.560
and start the meeting.

01:08.560 --> 01:12.000
OK, bucket boy. You're up.

01:13.280 --> 01:15.800
It might be kind of hard
to cool down,

01:15.800 --> 01:18.200
'cause my story
has to do with fire.

01:19.600 --> 01:22.200
Look at our fire. It's got
a life of its own.

01:22.200 --> 01:24.640
It gives off light and heat

01:24.640 --> 01:26.840
and makes
a nice warm crackling sound.

01:26.840 --> 01:28.200
But given the chance,

01:28.200 --> 01:31.360
it can cause
horrible destruction.

01:34.800 --> 01:36.720
I'm not talking
about the damage

01:36.720 --> 01:38.840
it can do
while it's burning.

01:38.840 --> 01:41.480
I'm talking
about the damage it can do

01:41.480 --> 01:44.400
after it's been put out.

01:44.400 --> 01:46.160
Submitted for the approval

01:46.160 --> 01:48.080

01:48.080 --> 01:50.280

<i>Tucker: Jimmy and roxie's
parents had split up,</i>

02:49.760 --> 02:51.760
<i> and even though
they stayed friends,</i>

02:51.760 --> 02:53.600
<i> it was still hard
to deal with,</i>

02:53.600 --> 02:55.240
<i> especially for Jimmy.</i>

02:55.240 --> 02:57.760
<i> He had a lot of anger inside,</i>

02:57.760 --> 03:00.760
<i> and pretty much blamed
his dad for the breakup.</i>

03:00.760 --> 03:04.200
Wow. From Linda,
Roxie, and Jimmy.

03:04.200 --> 03:06.520
Thanks, guys.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.440
Thanks, Jimmy.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.120
[Beeper]

03:16.760 --> 03:18.760
They need me
at the hospital.

03:18.760 --> 03:22.680
I'll be back as soon
as I can.

03:22.680 --> 03:25.200
And don't let them
fill up on cake.

03:25.200 --> 03:27.200
I don't want to deal
with sugar fiends.

03:27.200 --> 03:30.040
Who, the kids or the guys?

03:30.040 --> 03:31.800
Both.

03:33.800 --> 03:36.520
Um, I got you a little bonus.

03:36.520 --> 03:38.320
Thanks, Rox.

03:40.440 --> 03:41.720
Hey, it's a...

03:42.960 --> 03:44.360
It's a...

03:44.360 --> 03:46.760
It's a nose ring.

03:48.680 --> 03:49.960
Yeah, a nose ring.

03:49.960 --> 03:52.080
It's a nice one, too.

03:54.920 --> 03:58.800
Uh-uh, it looks like
our Fire Ghost is back.

03:58.800 --> 04:00.680
Fire Ghost?

04:00.680 --> 04:03.200
Don't listen to him.
There's no such thing.

04:03.200 --> 04:04.440
[Cries out]

04:04.440 --> 04:06.120
Jimmy.

04:07.440 --> 04:09.320
You OK?

04:09.320 --> 04:10.400
Yeah.

04:10.400 --> 04:11.760
Here, let me see.

04:13.200 --> 04:14.200
Oh, Jimmy.

04:15.520 --> 04:17.440
Come on.
I'll fix you up.

04:30.240 --> 04:31.720
I can do it.

04:36.880 --> 04:38.720
Thanks for
the present, Jimmy.

04:38.720 --> 04:40.800
Mom picked it out.

04:42.720 --> 04:45.560
Listen, I'm sorry I missed
your ball game last week,

04:45.560 --> 04:48.000
but I had to fill
in for someone.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.280
You could have gotten
someone else.

04:49.280 --> 04:52.280
You always have a reason
not to be around,

04:52.280 --> 04:54.680
even when you
lived with us.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.400
You're right, Jimmy,
and I'm sorry.

05:00.400 --> 05:03.080
We haven't spent much
time together lately,

05:03.080 --> 05:05.480
but that's going to
change, I promise.

05:07.600 --> 05:10.200
Listen. Why don't we
go get some cake?

05:10.200 --> 05:12.600
We'll sneak over
to rec room.

05:12.600 --> 05:15.400
We got a new video
game last week.

05:15.400 --> 05:17.040
Just you and me.

05:17.040 --> 05:19.600
That's my guy. Come on.

05:22.320 --> 05:23.960
[Alarm]

05:23.960 --> 05:25.960
The warehouse
on 36th and Arch.

05:25.960 --> 05:27.680
4-alarm, everyone goes.

05:30.320 --> 05:32.800
Roxie. Call the hospital--
tell Mom.

05:39.600 --> 05:43.000
Come on, birthday boy.
We got to roll.

05:46.360 --> 05:50.560
[Siren blares]

05:56.880 --> 05:58.720
We'll do something
next weekend.

06:11.400 --> 06:13.880
Guess the party's over.

06:21.120 --> 06:23.160
It's dead.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.440
What happened?

06:47.600 --> 06:49.360
I thought everybody left.

06:57.160 --> 07:00.160
The wind must have knocked
out the phone line.

07:00.160 --> 07:01.920
Who are you?

07:01.920 --> 07:04.520
Jake Griffin.
I watch the place

07:04.520 --> 07:05.960
when the others are gone.

07:05.960 --> 07:08.360
Looks like you're going
to be here for a while.

07:08.360 --> 07:10.760
Might as well make
yourselves at home.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.000
You, uh...

07:15.000 --> 07:17.800
You ever heard
of a Fire Ghost?

07:18.920 --> 07:21.400
I've been a fire fighter
a long time.

07:22.800 --> 07:25.800
If there's one thing I
learned early on, it's this:

07:25.800 --> 07:28.720
Fire is like
a wild animal.

07:28.720 --> 07:32.640
It lives, it dies,
and it thinks.

07:32.640 --> 07:34.320
It thinks?

07:34.320 --> 07:37.640
Fire will do anything
to survive and grow.

07:37.640 --> 07:40.320
Of course, it's our job
to stop it...

07:42.880 --> 07:44.880
But that doesn't
mean it's dead.

07:44.880 --> 07:47.440
The spirit
of the fire remains.

07:47.440 --> 07:51.360
The Fire Ghost--
it follows fire fighters

07:51.360 --> 07:53.720
back to the station,
looking for revenge.

07:56.960 --> 07:59.880
Don't get caught by a
fire ghost, my friends,

07:59.880 --> 08:03.240
or it'll pull you into its
world of eternal flames.

08:03.240 --> 08:04.880
I've never heard
of anybody

08:04.880 --> 08:07.880
being caught
by a fire ghost before.

08:07.880 --> 08:10.520
That's because the
only way a fire ghost

08:10.520 --> 08:12.160
can cross
into our world

08:12.160 --> 08:14.080
is if you look right
into the flame.

08:14.080 --> 08:18.320
The Fire Ghost
dances and jumps.

08:19.760 --> 08:22.400
It lures you to watch,

08:22.400 --> 08:23.720
and before you know it,

08:23.720 --> 08:26.720
it's too late,
and it's here.

08:26.720 --> 08:30.440
But then how come
it's never happened?

08:30.440 --> 08:33.440
Fire fighters face flames
every day.

08:33.440 --> 08:36.400
We know enough
not to be tricked.

08:36.400 --> 08:39.080
Dad says there's
no such thing.

08:39.080 --> 08:42.159
Oh, he believes, all right.

08:42.159 --> 08:46.640
Danny knows there's a fire ghost
haunting this very station.

08:46.640 --> 08:51.000
It's just not the sort of
thing we like to talk about.

08:52.840 --> 08:54.800
The Fire Ghost
hates fire fighters,

08:54.800 --> 08:57.800
and you're the children
of one of the best.

08:57.800 --> 09:00.400
Be very careful while
you're in the station.

09:03.320 --> 09:05.200
What do you think?

09:05.200 --> 09:08.440
I think Jake's been wearing
his helmet a little too tight.

09:25.040 --> 09:26.920
Roxie, if I ask you
something,

09:26.920 --> 09:28.880
would you promise
not to get mad?

09:28.880 --> 09:30.680
Sure.

09:32.320 --> 09:35.920
Whose fault do you think
it was that they split up?

09:35.920 --> 09:38.720
Not again, Jimmy.
It doesn't matter.

09:38.720 --> 09:41.840
But there's got to be
someone to blame.

09:41.840 --> 09:43.120
Would you stop?

09:43.120 --> 09:45.040
It just happened, OK?

09:45.040 --> 09:46.720
It doesn't matter
who's to blame.

09:46.720 --> 09:49.320
You promised
you wouldn't get mad.

09:49.320 --> 09:50.720
I lied.

09:55.680 --> 09:58.560
[Crackling]

10:39.800 --> 10:41.840
Jake?

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
Hey.

11:53.960 --> 11:55.480
Don't scare me like that.

11:55.480 --> 11:56.960
That ghost story really
got to you, huh?

11:56.960 --> 11:58.720
No, really,
there was a...

11:58.720 --> 12:00.240
[Telephone rings]

12:00.240 --> 12:01.840
All right.
The phones work.

12:09.720 --> 12:12.280
It's still dead.

12:12.280 --> 12:13.360
But it just rang.

12:13.360 --> 12:14.840
I don't...

12:14.840 --> 12:18.240
<i>Man: Jimmy, you're the son
of a murderer,</i>

12:18.240 --> 12:19.880
<i> and your time has come.</i>

12:19.880 --> 12:21.520
[Laughter]

12:21.520 --> 12:23.160
I don't think
we're alone.

12:23.160 --> 12:25.360
[Laughter]

12:32.080 --> 12:33.680
Jimmy!
Roxie!

12:33.680 --> 12:34.800
Help!

12:37.880 --> 12:39.320
Jimmy!

12:41.000 --> 12:43.240
Jimmy! Somebody help, please!

12:44.480 --> 12:46.040
Jimmy!

12:52.840 --> 12:53.600
Jimmy!

12:53.600 --> 12:55.760
Look out!

13:06.360 --> 13:09.640
Both: Jake, Jake!

13:09.640 --> 13:11.160
Help!

13:13.720 --> 13:15.160
Come on, let's go!

13:20.480 --> 13:21.640
Come on!

13:48.720 --> 13:49.840
Jake.

13:49.840 --> 13:51.880
I've been looking all over
for you 2.

13:51.880 --> 13:54.560
It's real, Jake.
The Fire Ghost is here.

13:54.560 --> 13:57.280
I know. I want you both out
of here as fast as you can.

13:57.280 --> 13:58.600
But--

13:58.600 --> 14:00.080
Don't stop,
don't look back.

14:00.080 --> 14:02.480
Just get outside
as fast as you can.

14:02.480 --> 14:05.000
But be careful.
It's full of tricks.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.720
How do you know so much
about ghosts?

14:07.720 --> 14:10.200
It takes one to know one.

14:22.080 --> 14:23.520
The window.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.560
Let's go!

14:38.920 --> 14:40.760
Easy, easy. I'm not
going to hurt you.

14:40.760 --> 14:42.800
Oh, man, are we glad
to see you.

14:42.800 --> 14:44.440
Oh, somehow I doubt that.

14:44.440 --> 14:45.640
What do you mean?

14:45.640 --> 14:47.640
I just heard you
smash that window.

14:47.640 --> 14:49.640
Oh, we're not making
trouble, officer.

14:49.640 --> 14:51.800
We're running
from the Fire Ghost.

14:51.800 --> 14:53.000
The what?

14:53.000 --> 14:56.040
The Fire Ghost.
It's after us.

14:56.040 --> 14:58.320
You want to run that
by me again?

14:58.320 --> 15:02.320
Look, I know it sounds crazy,
but our dad, he works here--

15:02.320 --> 15:04.360
he's a fire fighter.

15:04.360 --> 15:05.680
Oh, is that right?

15:05.680 --> 15:07.160
Well, we'll just see.

15:09.720 --> 15:11.480
Hey, the lights work.

15:12.680 --> 15:13.840
Anyone here?

15:14.920 --> 15:16.440
[Creaking]

15:16.440 --> 15:17.880
It's in there.

15:19.400 --> 15:23.480
Um, I think we better go.

15:28.440 --> 15:29.840
Hello.

15:31.080 --> 15:35.240
This is the police.
Come on out of there.

15:56.240 --> 15:57.680
It must be hiding.

15:57.680 --> 16:01.160
All right. Enough nonsense.

16:01.160 --> 16:03.040
Both of you in there now.

16:03.040 --> 16:04.320
Why?

16:04.320 --> 16:06.600
I'm going to take
a look around,

16:06.600 --> 16:08.920
and I don't want
to watch you--in!

16:08.920 --> 16:10.840
No way.

16:10.840 --> 16:12.800
You're in enough trouble
as it is. Now get in there.

16:12.800 --> 16:14.520
I can't.

16:16.080 --> 16:17.400
[Cries out]

16:17.400 --> 16:20.960
Welcome to my parlor.

16:23.360 --> 16:26.400
[Laughing]

16:31.240 --> 16:34.720
I told you it was
full of tricks.

16:34.720 --> 16:36.400
Please don't hurt us.

16:36.400 --> 16:38.960
Hurt you? I've been
watching out for you 2

16:38.960 --> 16:41.080
since the company left.

16:41.080 --> 16:44.360
I'm a little disappointed,
though.

16:44.360 --> 16:47.360
I told you not to look
at the flame.

16:47.360 --> 16:49.000
You looked
at the flame?

16:49.000 --> 16:50.320
Only for a second.

16:50.320 --> 16:51.640
That's all it takes.

16:51.640 --> 16:53.960
Well, you're the one
who released it,

16:53.960 --> 16:57.720
you're the one who's
gonna have to stop it.

16:57.720 --> 17:00.080
Me? How?

17:00.080 --> 17:02.520
Same way you
stop any fire.

17:06.839 --> 17:10.640
But it won't be easy.
This one's crafty.

17:10.640 --> 17:11.880
Yeah, we know.

17:14.920 --> 17:17.839
I've been keeping that Fire
Ghost away from here

17:17.839 --> 17:19.240
for too long.

17:19.240 --> 17:21.599
I'm glad it's nearly over.

17:21.599 --> 17:23.800
Who are you, really?

17:24.960 --> 17:29.400
I used to be a member
of this engine company.

17:29.400 --> 17:32.200
Then a few years back,
another fire fighter and I

17:32.200 --> 17:35.200
were rescuing an old woman
from a burning house.

17:35.200 --> 17:38.200
He carried her out,
and I went back inside

17:38.200 --> 17:40.720
looking for more people.

17:40.720 --> 17:44.000
The last thing I remember
was him yelling at me

17:44.000 --> 17:46.760
that the roof was gonna go--
and it did.

17:48.480 --> 17:50.600
I didn't make it.

17:50.600 --> 17:54.400
That was the fire this Fire
Ghost came from.

17:56.520 --> 18:00.360
That other fire fighter
was your father.

18:00.360 --> 18:02.440
He never told us that.

18:02.440 --> 18:04.080
He took it pretty hard.

18:04.080 --> 18:08.520
He thought it was his fault
I didn't make it,

18:08.520 --> 18:10.840
but there was no blame
to be had.

18:10.840 --> 18:14.360
Truth is, he saved
that woman's life.

18:14.360 --> 18:18.160
Sometimes, things just happen.

18:18.160 --> 18:22.680
You can't always be looking
for someone to blame.

18:22.680 --> 18:24.960
What are we gonna do?
It's gonna come after us.

18:24.960 --> 18:28.280
Worse than that
-- it's gonna come after the fire fighters.

18:28.280 --> 18:31.520
We've got to stop it
before they get back.

18:31.520 --> 18:33.440
How do we get it
to come out?

18:33.440 --> 18:37.680
All we need is a little bait.

19:03.120 --> 19:04.920
Hey, you.

19:06.360 --> 19:09.520
Are you gonna
come and get me?

19:09.520 --> 19:11.080
[Crackling]

19:11.080 --> 19:13.360
Or are you afraid?

19:25.600 --> 19:30.000
You are the son
of a murderer,

19:30.000 --> 19:33.840
and your time has come.

19:33.840 --> 19:36.960
My father's not a murderer.

19:36.960 --> 19:41.800
He and his kind
destroy the fire.

19:41.800 --> 19:47.680
First, you will pay,
and when they return,

19:47.680 --> 19:51.640
they will
join the flames.

19:53.040 --> 19:54.520
That's what you think.

20:03.440 --> 20:05.240
You got it.

20:09.720 --> 20:12.680
Fire fighting is in
your blood, young lady.

20:12.680 --> 20:16.160
I never saw anyone work
a fire extinguisher...

20:24.440 --> 20:26.440
Why didn't it work?

20:26.440 --> 20:29.560
I don't know.
Leave him alone.

20:29.560 --> 20:34.160
<i>You didn't leave me alone.</i>

20:34.160 --> 20:35.960
You got no beef
with them.

20:35.960 --> 20:39.160
You can't stop me
any longer.

20:41.320 --> 20:42.400
Please.

20:44.160 --> 20:46.240
I hate fire.

20:46.240 --> 20:49.160
Do anything,
but please don't use fire.

20:49.160 --> 20:50.360
<i>I am fire.</i>

20:52.400 --> 20:54.000
Yeah, but it's too horrible.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.600
Please do anything you want,

20:55.600 --> 20:58.800
but don't turn into fire.

21:00.880 --> 21:07.760
This is sweeter than
I could ever imagine.

21:11.200 --> 21:13.560
[Laughing]

21:19.440 --> 21:21.600
[Screaming]

21:27.200 --> 21:29.040
Adios, hotshot.

21:29.040 --> 21:30.520
Yes!

21:31.680 --> 21:33.440
He tricked me once,

21:33.440 --> 21:35.760
thought I'd repay
the favor.

21:48.240 --> 21:50.680
I guess I'm done here.

21:50.680 --> 21:52.440
Thanks
for helping us, Jake.

21:52.440 --> 21:54.680
Hey, that's my job.

21:54.680 --> 21:56.800
Fire fighters always
stick together.

21:56.800 --> 21:58.720
Remember me
to your father.

22:04.960 --> 22:06.880
[Rattling]

22:19.960 --> 22:21.280
Uh...

22:23.280 --> 22:26.600
Does somebody want
to tell me what happened here?

22:33.400 --> 22:35.600
Tucker: The Fire Ghost
was never seen

22:35.600 --> 22:37.000
at the station again,

22:37.000 --> 22:40.240
and Jimmy and Roxie started
spending a lot more time

22:40.240 --> 22:41.240
with their dad.

22:41.240 --> 22:42.640
The end.

22:42.640 --> 22:44.720
Nice job, bucket boy.

22:54.480 --> 22:56.760
I was gonna give you
this before,

22:56.760 --> 23:00.960
but we started yelling at each other, and
-- well, here.

23:02.520 --> 23:04.400
It was my fault that
your sweater got stolen,

23:04.400 --> 23:06.760
and I hope that's enough
to buy you a new one.

23:06.760 --> 23:10.320
It wasn't
all your fault.

23:11.600 --> 23:13.240
Let's split it.

23:14.280 --> 23:16.280
Friends?

23:16.280 --> 23:17.280
Friends.

23:17.280 --> 23:19.640
Aw, how cute.

23:19.640 --> 23:21.000
Get bent.

23:25.840 --> 23:27.320
Now what?

23:27.320 --> 23:30.200
We'll throw dirt on it--
no big deal.

23:35.240 --> 23:37.280
See, it's dead already.

23:37.280 --> 23:40.280
Yeah. Not a bad idea.
