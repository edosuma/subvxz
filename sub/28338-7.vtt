Your oatmeal, my Queen.

00:51.500 --> 00:54.710
Raw and soaked,
just how you like it.

00:54.710 --> 00:57.040
It's really cool
that you're having this, uh,

00:57.040 --> 00:58.880
Queen's monster breakfast.

00:58.880 --> 01:02.420
I want the monsters
to feel comfortable
at the Queen's table.

01:02.420 --> 01:05.710
Yeah! Just, uh,
where are the monsters?

01:06.830 --> 01:08.420
Huh.

01:08.420 --> 01:11.540
-Manfred! Come here!.
-Yes, M'lady?

01:11.540 --> 01:15.540
Manfred, did you forget
to invite the monsters?

01:15.540 --> 01:17.250
No, of course not, M'lady.

01:17.250 --> 01:19.380
The monsters are right here.

01:19.380 --> 01:21.540
[Manfred]
In their proper place.

01:21.540 --> 01:25.540
What?! Why are they eating
out of dog bowls?

01:25.540 --> 01:28.330
Oh. Do they not normally,
M'lady?

01:28.330 --> 01:29.880
Take their food
back to the kitchen,

01:29.880 --> 01:32.330
and put it on proper plates.

01:32.330 --> 01:34.000
Oh, and take mine,
while you're at it.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.500
I'll eat when everybody else
has their food.

01:36.500 --> 01:38.290
Yes, my Queen.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.710
Oh. I guess we'll wait, too.

01:44.710 --> 01:48.540
Ugh! Apparently, the Queen
would like the monsters

01:48.540 --> 01:51.380
to eat from the royal china.

01:51.380 --> 01:52.920
Yes, my lord.

01:52.920 --> 01:54.790
Well, wouldn't we all
like to eat

01:54.790 --> 01:57.250
from the royal china. Heh.

01:57.250 --> 02:00.040
[grunting]

02:01.460 --> 02:02.460
[Sous-Chef screams]

02:02.460 --> 02:03.540

-[Marco exclaims]
-[all gasp]

02:08.460 --> 02:10.460
[laughing]

02:10.460 --> 02:14.170
Oh, looks like someone
fed yada yada berries
to Manfred. [laughs]

02:14.170 --> 02:16.380
Wait. Yada yada berries,
what's that?

02:16.380 --> 02:18.040
Yada yada berries?
You know.

02:18.040 --> 02:19.830
You feed them to someone,
and... yada yada.

02:19.830 --> 02:21.380
They never bother you again.

02:21.380 --> 02:22.540
Funny thing
about them, though--

02:24.670 --> 02:26.620
They're actually
quite delicious,

02:26.620 --> 02:29.460
once you get past the whole
"turning to stone" part.

02:30.920 --> 02:32.500
So good!

02:32.500 --> 02:36.540
But Manfred was eating out
of Eclipsa's bowl.

02:36.540 --> 02:39.040
I don't understand.
Why would somebody want
to yada yada you?

02:39.040 --> 02:41.880
This kind of thing
comes with the territory
when you're queen.

02:41.880 --> 02:44.170
You can't let it
rule your life, you know.

02:44.170 --> 02:47.580
I don't know!
But you know what?
I plan to find out.

02:47.580 --> 02:49.670
Marco and I are about
to go on an adventure.

02:49.670 --> 02:52.000
We are going to search
every filthy back alley,

02:52.000 --> 02:54.250
confront every
underhanded assassin,

02:54.250 --> 02:56.040
and wade through every sewer

02:56.040 --> 02:58.750
until we find out who tried
to yada yada you.
Right, Marco?!

02:58.750 --> 03:00.670
-Uh... [yelps]
-[Star] That's right!

03:03.250 --> 03:05.710
I love these berries!

03:08.670 --> 03:10.880
OK, whoever wanted
to yada yada Eclipsa

03:10.880 --> 03:13.040
definitely went through here.

03:13.040 --> 03:15.120
[grunting]

03:15.120 --> 03:18.710
Well, looks like we got
a real mystery on our hands.

03:18.710 --> 03:22.750
-[door dings]
-And we're just crazy enough
to take the case.

03:22.750 --> 03:26.170
Hello. Welcome to
the Assassins Guild.

03:26.170 --> 03:28.380
Who would you like
to have bumped off today?

03:30.620 --> 03:32.880
Wait, Rasticore?

03:32.880 --> 03:34.620
[whispering] Don't come over.
Don't come over.
Don't come over.

03:34.620 --> 03:37.540
-Don't come--
-Rasticore, it is you!

03:37.540 --> 03:40.120
Aren't you lookin'...
small?

03:40.120 --> 03:45.880
[groans] Regenerating
from a single hand
has not been easy!

03:45.880 --> 03:47.620
[groans] What do you want?

03:47.620 --> 03:49.540
Some information.

03:49.540 --> 03:50.620
Do you know anything
about a plot

03:50.620 --> 03:52.460
to yada yada Eclipsa?

03:52.460 --> 03:54.460
Will you leave me alone
if I tell you?

03:54.460 --> 03:55.580
I might.

03:56.750 --> 03:58.080
OK, OK!

03:58.080 --> 04:00.250
All I know is this chick Babs

04:00.250 --> 04:02.080
didn't show up for work today.

04:02.080 --> 04:03.250
Now, get outta here.

04:03.250 --> 04:05.330
Babs, ya say?

04:05.330 --> 04:06.790
We got a lead!

04:06.790 --> 04:08.460
Thanks, little guy!

04:09.750 --> 04:10.620

[doorbell rings]

04:16.500 --> 04:18.330
[heavy breathing]

04:18.330 --> 04:21.710
[moans] What do you want?

04:21.710 --> 04:23.960
We're lookin' for Babs.

04:23.960 --> 04:25.380
Who's lookin'?

04:25.380 --> 04:27.330
Oh, just a friend
of the Queen.

04:27.330 --> 04:28.790
Lookin' for some answers.

04:28.790 --> 04:30.290
[gruffly]
And I'm gonna get 'em!

04:31.920 --> 04:33.710

[clears throat]

04:38.330 --> 04:41.920

[blows nose]

04:41.920 --> 04:44.210
Y'all want some tea?

04:45.670 --> 04:47.920
[sighs] Much better.

04:47.920 --> 04:50.750
-[cats meowing]
-You have a lot of cats.

04:50.750 --> 04:53.290
I mean, uh,
for an assassin.

04:53.290 --> 04:55.580
Don't worry.
They're all friendly.

04:55.580 --> 04:56.750
-[cat yowls]
-[Marco screams]

04:56.750 --> 04:58.580
'Cept Ol' One-Ear.

04:58.580 --> 04:59.580
Got it.

05:00.960 --> 05:05.500
Would ya like some tea?
[coughing]

05:05.500 --> 05:07.880
-No thank you.
-One, please!

05:07.880 --> 05:09.290
Marco, gross!

05:09.290 --> 05:11.790
-What?
-[groans] Guh.

05:11.790 --> 05:13.540
[sighs] OK, so, Babs--

05:13.540 --> 05:14.920
Were you or were you not hired

05:14.920 --> 05:16.880
to yada yada the Queen
this morning?

05:16.880 --> 05:20.500
Uh, yeah! Oh! Wasn't supposed
to tell you that.

05:20.500 --> 05:22.580
But I didn't do it!
I called in sick,

05:22.580 --> 05:24.830
'cause I woke up
with pink eye, pneumonia,

05:24.830 --> 05:27.790
-[sipping]
-[Babs] ...and a weird rash.

05:27.790 --> 05:28.750
Blech!

05:28.750 --> 05:30.460
So, who hired you, Babs?!

05:30.460 --> 05:31.830
It was an anonymous client!

05:31.830 --> 05:34.750
Just a note and some berries
from Apothecary Sherry.

05:34.750 --> 05:37.790
Ohh! I wasn't supposed
to tell you that.

05:37.790 --> 05:40.580
[Star]
Apothecary Sherry, huh?

05:40.580 --> 05:43.580
-Another lead.
-[Marco groaning]

05:43.580 --> 05:45.620
Get your stink bombs,
wart remover,

05:45.620 --> 05:47.710
hair growth potions,
itching powder.

05:47.710 --> 05:51.580
Schoolyard bully discount!
Anti-itch cream-- Huh?

05:51.580 --> 05:53.670
Oh, hey, Sherry, how ya doin'?
Let's skip the small talk.

05:53.670 --> 05:55.420
Got any yada yada berries?!

05:56.710 --> 05:57.960
You know, kid,
those things are dangerous.

05:57.960 --> 05:59.670
Shouldn't even be
on the market.

05:59.670 --> 06:02.170
So, you, uh, don't sell 'em?

06:02.170 --> 06:03.830
Hey, I never said that.

06:03.830 --> 06:07.250
We're not here to buy!
We need to know who did.

06:07.250 --> 06:10.880
You expect me to just
rat out my own patrons?
What are ya, crazy?

06:10.880 --> 06:13.080
I have a strict
confidentiality policy with--

06:13.080 --> 06:15.330
Ohh! [sniffs]

06:15.330 --> 06:18.460
--valued customers
such as yourselves.

06:18.460 --> 06:20.710
I only sold it to one guy.

06:20.710 --> 06:22.790
[Star]
"Ruben."

06:29.670 --> 06:31.670
[Marco whispering]
Looks like no one's home.

06:31.670 --> 06:33.920
[Star]
Looks that way, doesn't it?

06:33.920 --> 06:35.670
[Marco]
Oh, boy, I know what that means.

06:35.670 --> 06:36.710
[grunting]

06:36.710 --> 06:38.830
-Double Rainbow Fists!
-[yelps]

06:38.830 --> 06:41.830
[exclaiming]
Narwhal Blast!

06:43.710 --> 06:45.750
Aah! What are you doing?

06:45.750 --> 06:49.290
-Aah!
-I'm getting this rat
out of his hole.

06:49.290 --> 06:51.880
Blueberry Cupcake Bazooka!

06:51.880 --> 06:54.710
OK, OK!
Stop destroyin' my house!

06:54.710 --> 06:56.710
I knew you were hiding in here!

06:56.710 --> 07:00.380
Whoa! How'd you know
he was a chameleon monster?

07:00.380 --> 07:02.500
I saw the family portrait.

07:02.500 --> 07:04.210
All right, Ruben,
now tell me about

07:04.210 --> 07:06.420
your little visit
to Apothecary Sherry today!

07:06.420 --> 07:09.120
Yeah! I bought the berries
to yada yada Eclipsa.

07:09.120 --> 07:11.710
She made me eat out of
a dog bowl this mornin'!

07:11.710 --> 07:15.170
What? Eclipsa made sure
you were served
on the royal china.

07:15.170 --> 07:17.000
Too little, too late!

07:17.000 --> 07:20.250
I ate my breakfast,
then I went to Sherry
and bought them berries!

07:20.250 --> 07:23.170
Wait. You bought the berries
after breakfast?

07:23.170 --> 07:25.170
Yeah! And I wasn't
the only one!

07:25.170 --> 07:27.170
She got enemies left and right!

07:27.170 --> 07:28.790
Ugh. We got the wrong guy.

07:28.790 --> 07:30.250
Sorry, Ruben.
Victimless crime.

07:30.250 --> 07:32.960
What?! You destroyed my home!

07:32.960 --> 07:35.420
Come on, sounds like Sherry
was holding out on us.

07:35.420 --> 07:37.790
-[whistling]
-[footsteps approaching]

07:37.790 --> 07:41.000
[panting] So, you wanna
play games, huh?

07:41.000 --> 07:43.920
-Excuse me?
-You're playin' games, Sherry!

07:43.920 --> 07:44.920
And I don't like it.

07:44.920 --> 07:46.750
Hey, I told you
everything I know.

07:46.750 --> 07:48.790
Who bought the berries,
Sherry?!

07:48.790 --> 07:50.920
I'm tellin ya,
nobody else bought berries.

07:50.920 --> 07:52.830
You're playin' those games,
Sherry.

07:52.830 --> 07:53.960
And I'm done playing.

07:53.960 --> 07:55.540
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

07:55.540 --> 07:56.750
How 'bout you take a break?

07:56.750 --> 07:58.330
But I get results...

07:58.330 --> 08:01.000
Look, Sherry, we know
other people bought berries.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.500
Just make it easy on yourself
and give us their names.

08:03.500 --> 08:05.120
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

08:05.120 --> 08:07.500
Then I guess we'll just have
to take you back

08:07.500 --> 08:09.710
to the Monster Temple
for questioning.

08:09.710 --> 08:12.460
I'm sure Eclipsa will have
some dark spell
to jog your memory.

08:12.460 --> 08:15.000
-Ohh, I know she will.
-Oh, you know?

08:15.000 --> 08:17.880
I think I'm just gonna
stick around here, thanks.

08:17.880 --> 08:20.500
[gulping]

08:24.080 --> 08:25.920
Aah.

08:25.920 --> 08:30.290
You can tell Eclipsa
that she can yada yada my--

08:30.290 --> 08:31.710
[gasps]

08:31.710 --> 08:34.790
Wow. She just
self-yada yada'ed.

08:34.790 --> 08:36.000
Shameful.

08:37.790 --> 08:40.210
[Star]
Hrm, just the one receipt, huh?

08:40.210 --> 08:43.000
Maybe there's more, heh.
Aah! Ah!

08:43.000 --> 08:44.880
All the yada yada berry
receipts.

08:44.880 --> 08:47.830
Whoa, that's a lot of Mewmans.

08:51.210 --> 08:54.670
We can't lock 'em all up...
can we?

08:54.670 --> 08:56.040
-[all grumbling]
-[man] Let me outta here!

08:56.040 --> 08:57.250
[Star]
All right, listen up!

08:57.250 --> 08:59.380
Everybody in this room
bought yada yada berries

08:59.380 --> 09:01.830
from Apothecary Sherry,
but only one of you

09:01.830 --> 09:03.750
put them in Eclipsa's oatmeal
this morning.

09:03.750 --> 09:07.250
So we can do this the easy way
or the hard way.

09:07.250 --> 09:10.080
-[Star] Who was it?
-[man] Wasn't me.

09:10.080 --> 09:12.040
I expected better
of Mewmanity.

09:12.040 --> 09:13.790
Of all of you.

09:13.790 --> 09:16.250
I know, underneath it all,
you're good people.

09:16.250 --> 09:18.080
So one of ya made a mistake.

09:18.080 --> 09:20.750
Life's hard in Mewni
these days. I get it.

09:20.750 --> 09:22.960
[all murmuring in agreement]

09:22.960 --> 09:25.500
It is tough!
But you know what we do?

09:25.500 --> 09:27.960
As Mewmans? We survive!

09:27.960 --> 09:30.500
-[all cheering]
-[woman] I'm a survivor!

09:30.500 --> 09:33.960
-And we rebuild!
-[all] Yeah!

09:33.960 --> 09:37.380
And we turn in the criminal
who tried to poison Eclipsa!

09:38.580 --> 09:39.880
[man coughs]

09:39.880 --> 09:43.920
OK, you guys. Look, Eclipsa
is not a bad person.

09:43.920 --> 09:46.080
Yes, she is!
She stole me family's land!

09:46.080 --> 09:47.620
-[all talking]
-[man] She's a dirty--

09:47.620 --> 09:49.750
Don't even matter who tried
to yada yada her.

09:49.750 --> 09:51.420
She's gonna off us all, anyway!

09:51.420 --> 09:53.750
OK, enough! You people are--

09:53.750 --> 09:58.000
Star. It's OK.
I understand why
they feel this way.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.710
I've upended all their lives
quite thoroughly.

10:00.710 --> 10:04.920
I am asking you
to give me a chance
to earn your trust.

10:04.920 --> 10:08.040
But I know that takes time,
so for now--

10:08.040 --> 10:09.670
You're all free to go.

10:14.080 --> 10:16.000
-[Mewmans grumbling]
-Sorry about all of this.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.710
Man, I still don't
trust her.

10:17.710 --> 10:20.960
Yeah. She's only doin' this
to make herself look better.

10:20.960 --> 10:24.290
-[sighs]
-I cannot believe
you just did that!

10:24.290 --> 10:27.620
[grunts] Eclipsa,
people want to yada yada you,

10:27.620 --> 10:29.710
and you just let them go?

10:29.710 --> 10:32.500
And now, we'll never know
what secrets Sherry
took with her

10:32.500 --> 10:34.920
to the smooth,
berry-flavored beyond.

10:34.920 --> 10:37.040
There will always be people
who don't like you.

10:37.040 --> 10:39.120
If I'd locked up
everyone who hated me,

10:39.120 --> 10:40.620
there'd be no one left!

10:40.620 --> 10:44.040
[stammering] B-but I wanted
to crack the case!

10:44.040 --> 10:45.460
Don't worry about it.

10:45.460 --> 10:48.670
Manfred will be
back to normal. Eventually.

10:48.670 --> 10:52.000
-No harm, no foul.
-Uh, not quite.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.120
I think Babs gave me pink eye.

10:54.120 --> 10:55.290
Ew.

10:55.290 --> 10:58.290
Eclipsa, I-- I don't think
you realize

10:58.290 --> 11:00.290
how much the Mewmans hate you.

11:00.290 --> 11:04.290
Oh, I do. That's why I need
to earn their trust.

11:04.290 --> 11:07.120
-But how?
-I don't know.

11:07.120 --> 11:09.380
But we'll figure something out.
