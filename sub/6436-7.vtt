WEBVTT

00:06.966 --> 00:09.457
(theme music playing )

00:37.455 --> 00:39.741
(Sura moaning)

00:56.182 --> 00:58.138
That was...

00:58.309 --> 00:59.799
vigorous.

00:59.977 --> 01:02.309
( both laugh )

01:02.480 --> 01:04.892
You looked like the sort of man
who could handle it.

01:05.066 --> 01:07.057
I am rather rugged.

01:12.198 --> 01:13.608
I must go.

01:13.783 --> 01:15.364
Father will be worried.

01:15.534 --> 01:17.035
As well he should be.

01:17.203 --> 01:18.613
( laughs)

01:18.788 --> 01:20.824
l have to go.

01:20.998 --> 01:23.865
If you do, my heart will break.

01:26.754 --> 01:28.164
Ask me to stay.

01:28.339 --> 01:30.125
Stay.

01:31.884 --> 01:33.749
Ask me

01:33.928 --> 01:36.010
by my name.

01:38.266 --> 01:40.678
You don't even know it,
do you?

01:43.104 --> 01:45.470
Sura.

01:45.648 --> 01:47.809
My name is Sura.

01:47.984 --> 01:50.600
Sura--

01:50.778 --> 01:52.985
as beautiful
as the woman herself.

01:54.949 --> 01:56.189
My name--

01:56.367 --> 01:57.982
Every woman knows
who you are,

01:58.160 --> 01:59.616
and to avoid you.

02:01.622 --> 02:02.953
That bad am I?

02:03.124 --> 02:05.456
The worst.

02:08.462 --> 02:10.498
Then why lay with a man
of such ill reputation?

02:10.673 --> 02:12.584
The gods led me to your bed.

02:12.758 --> 02:14.965
( laughs)

02:15.136 --> 02:16.421
The gods?

02:16.595 --> 02:18.506
They come to me

02:18.681 --> 02:20.717
in my dreams.

02:20.891 --> 02:22.756
They showed me
the man you could become.

02:22.935 --> 02:24.766
Could?

02:24.937 --> 02:28.100
If set upon the right path.

02:28.274 --> 02:31.858
What else did the gods tell you
about my future?

02:33.404 --> 02:36.441
That you will never love
another woman.

04:52.918 --> 04:55.409
The heart weighs heavy--

04:55.588 --> 04:57.374
so much hope in reunion

04:57.548 --> 04:59.038
to come to such bitter end.

04:59.216 --> 05:01.172
How is it so?

05:01.343 --> 05:04.380
The fault is mine.

05:06.182 --> 05:08.594
The road from Neapolis
is known to be treacherous.

05:08.767 --> 05:10.849
I should have doubled the guard,
tripled it.

05:11.020 --> 05:12.851
I should have delayed
giving Barca his freedom

05:13.022 --> 05:15.058
and sent him along as well.

05:15.232 --> 05:17.564
(sighs)

05:17.735 --> 05:19.566
Pray the gods
forgive my error.

05:19.737 --> 05:21.193
No.

05:21.363 --> 05:23.274
You kept your word.

05:23.449 --> 05:26.236
The fault lies with the men
who took her life

05:26.410 --> 05:28.617
and with Claudius Glaber

05:28.787 --> 05:30.948
who condemned her to slavery.

05:33.417 --> 05:35.829
There is nothing to be done
to change what has passed.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.415
We must look to the future.

05:38.589 --> 05:41.331
You are the bringer of rain,

05:41.509 --> 05:43.670
the slayer of death.

05:43.844 --> 05:46.631
Together we will etch
the name Spartacus

05:46.805 --> 05:48.466
into the pillars of history.

05:53.103 --> 05:55.014
( quietly ) Spartacus.

05:55.189 --> 05:57.521
That is not what she called me.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.227
That is not my name.

06:00.277 --> 06:02.233
It is now.

06:11.330 --> 06:13.446
Nearly a year
you had me searching

06:13.624 --> 06:16.161
for that Thracian woman.

06:16.335 --> 06:19.247
Why have me take her life
short of the mark?

06:19.421 --> 06:21.036
An unfortunate necessity.

06:21.215 --> 06:23.501
I trust the sum sufficient?

06:23.676 --> 06:26.588
If other necessities arise,

06:26.762 --> 06:28.753
consider me your man.

06:34.186 --> 06:38.600
So great an expense,
to have her delivered all but dead.

06:38.774 --> 06:41.015
You could just as easily
have told Spartacus

06:41.193 --> 06:42.774
that she perished abroad.

06:42.945 --> 06:44.276
She was his life,

06:44.446 --> 06:46.357
the heart beating
beneath his chest.

06:46.532 --> 06:49.148
No, such a man would not believe
she was gone

06:49.326 --> 06:51.282
unless his own eyes
told him it was so.

06:51.453 --> 06:53.830
It was the only course.

06:53.998 --> 06:55.659
And one which you
could have told me

06:55.833 --> 06:58.245
you were undertaking.

06:58.419 --> 07:00.626
lwould keep such blood
from these hands,

07:00.796 --> 07:02.081
as l have said.

07:02.256 --> 07:04.372
They hold yours.

07:04.550 --> 07:06.882
Are they not stained
bythetouch?

07:07.052 --> 07:08.838
There has been
too much death of late.

07:09.013 --> 07:12.551
I would turn towards
more respectable ventures.

07:12.725 --> 07:15.137
With his wife
removed from thoughts,

07:15.311 --> 07:17.552
I will mold Spartacus
into a gladiator

07:17.730 --> 07:19.891
the likes of which
the world has never seen.

07:20.065 --> 07:22.898
He has already defeated Theokoles.
Imagine what he will accomplish

07:23.068 --> 07:25.605
once his mind has been focused
on nothing but victory.

07:25.779 --> 07:29.613
You will become the greatest lanista
in the republic.

07:29.783 --> 07:32.650
And on such a title we will climb
beyond our station,

07:32.828 --> 07:35.160
beyond Capua,

07:35.331 --> 07:40.121
perhaps to the very steps
of the senate itself.

07:55.100 --> 07:57.182
The fever still grips him?

07:59.355 --> 08:02.643
lwould know
if his condition changes.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.153
A word, Doctore.

08:17.331 --> 08:19.868
Pietros.

08:20.042 --> 08:22.033
The birds left in Barca's cell--

08:22.211 --> 08:23.701
what should I do with them?

08:23.879 --> 08:25.119
Whatever you wish.

08:25.297 --> 08:28.710
He said we would release them
once he gained our freedom.

08:28.884 --> 08:30.966
He intended yours as well?

08:31.136 --> 08:33.627
That was his purpose
in speaking with our dominus.

08:33.806 --> 08:36.639
Ashur said the price was
too steep for the both of us.

08:36.809 --> 08:37.969
Ashur?

08:38.143 --> 08:40.225
He helped negotiate the sum.

08:40.396 --> 08:42.557
Would it be okay
if I kept them--

08:42.731 --> 08:44.642
the birds?

08:45.984 --> 08:48.020
It would not cause notice.

08:49.405 --> 08:51.066
Thank you.

08:55.994 --> 08:58.030
(birds cooing)

09:42.875 --> 09:44.285
That is unwise.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.374
If the guards were
to see you with it...

09:51.675 --> 09:55.042
What could they do to me
that hasn't already been done?

09:56.054 --> 09:58.090
I never should have left her.

09:58.265 --> 09:59.880
You did not leave her.

10:00.058 --> 10:01.594
She was taken from you.

10:01.769 --> 10:04.602
Before I left for war,

10:04.772 --> 10:06.763
she asked me not to go.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.851
You did what you thought
was right

10:09.026 --> 10:11.187
to protect her.

10:12.654 --> 10:14.906
You should toss that
over the cliff.

10:16.074 --> 10:18.326
Best to be done
with such thoughts.

10:31.006 --> 10:33.622
Batiatus: Careful with that.
It cost more than you're worth.

10:33.801 --> 10:35.837
Lucretia: It won't be long
until our house

10:36.011 --> 10:37.842
is finally livable again.

10:38.013 --> 10:41.176
Batiatus: Tilt your bow higher.
We aim at the heavens--

10:41.350 --> 10:44.057
the palace of Batiatus
where dignitaries kneel

10:44.228 --> 10:46.264
to suck the cock
of my good fortune.

10:46.438 --> 10:48.770
Well, they'll have to
get in line.

10:51.944 --> 10:54.276
Crixus?

10:54.446 --> 10:56.732
(grunting)

11:05.165 --> 11:06.666
Lie still.

11:06.834 --> 11:08.119
Best heed the advice.

11:08.293 --> 11:10.204
For a while we thought you
for the afterlife.

11:10.379 --> 11:11.710
When will I fight again?

11:11.880 --> 11:14.622
"When will I fight again?"
he says.

11:14.800 --> 11:17.007
Worry of nothing but recovery.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.509
The crowd will once again
cheer the name Crixus.

11:19.680 --> 11:20.965
(snaps fingers)
A word.

11:26.562 --> 11:30.396
It would be improper for me
to visit you in the ludus,

11:30.566 --> 11:33.308
but know that my thoughts
are with you.

11:33.485 --> 11:37.069
I'll send my slave Naevia often
to attend your needs.

11:37.239 --> 11:39.321
Rest now

11:39.491 --> 11:41.732
and worry for nothing.

12:11.899 --> 12:14.185
Your swords for practice,
champion.

12:23.285 --> 12:26.823
( cracks whip )
The day's training begins.

12:26.997 --> 12:28.783
Pair up.

12:28.957 --> 12:31.073
Sword and shield.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.162
Spartacus,

12:33.337 --> 12:35.874
you face me.

12:47.643 --> 12:51.227
Your wife's passing--
that was an unfortunate thing,

12:51.396 --> 12:53.808
as was your plan for escape.

12:54.983 --> 12:57.395
l have not tasted wine
for many years,

12:57.569 --> 13:00.276
yet a single cup would not
rob me of my senses.

13:00.447 --> 13:02.403
The choice was
to see you sleep

13:02.574 --> 13:04.565
or never awaken.

13:18.715 --> 13:22.003
Your victory over Theokoles
is the only reason

13:22.177 --> 13:23.792
Batiatus does not know
of your treachery.

13:23.971 --> 13:27.429
Champion or no,
you would be crucified.

13:27.599 --> 13:30.261
Then part your lips
and see it done.

13:35.565 --> 13:38.147
Next time you seek escape,

13:38.318 --> 13:40.274
you'd best kill me.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.783
Make it half and half, yeah?

13:56.962 --> 14:00.045
Good Mercato,
you must excuse the chaos.

14:00.215 --> 14:02.797
I had hoped to see such affairs
completed before your arrival.

14:02.968 --> 14:04.583
Fortune favors you.

14:04.761 --> 14:07.423
As it does all of Capua,
since the rains.

14:07.597 --> 14:09.508
My time is pressed.
Come, let us to business.

14:09.683 --> 14:11.389
To the matter then.

14:11.560 --> 14:13.471
l secured six of your men
for my games

14:13.645 --> 14:15.510
honoring the storied history
of my family--

14:15.689 --> 14:18.647
arrangements made
before the vulcanalia, if you recall.

14:18.817 --> 14:20.102
As if it were yesterday.

14:20.277 --> 14:21.892
Well, I've decided as highlight

14:22.070 --> 14:24.152
to reenact Rome's victory
over the Maedi,

14:24.322 --> 14:26.483
the Thracian tribe
who dared invade Macedonia.

14:26.658 --> 14:28.489
They were slaughtered
for their insolence

14:28.660 --> 14:31.037
by my grandfather
Marcus Minucius Rufus.

14:31.204 --> 14:34.617
A name that carries weight
long after its passing.

14:34.791 --> 14:37.749
l'd planned for Crixus
to play the very man himself,

14:37.919 --> 14:39.500
- leading the charge.
- Apologies.

14:39.671 --> 14:41.912
Crixus is yet recovering
from his battle with Theokoles.

14:42.090 --> 14:43.705
Ah, as I suspected.

14:43.884 --> 14:45.465
Perhaps Gnaeus then?

14:45.635 --> 14:48.627
I turn thought
towards Spartacus.

14:48.805 --> 14:51.182
( chuckles )
He is much in demand.

14:51.349 --> 14:53.840
- The cost of such a thing?
- An additional 40%.

14:54.019 --> 14:55.850
Prisoners to play the Thracians
included?

14:56.021 --> 14:57.477
Consider it done.

14:57.647 --> 14:59.899
I will see it announced
all over Capua--

15:00.067 --> 15:03.025
Spartacus,
slayer of Theokoles,

15:03.195 --> 15:06.358
to assume the mantle
of my grandfather--

15:06.531 --> 15:08.613
a great day.

15:14.873 --> 15:17.865
Pietros, bring more water.

15:20.629 --> 15:22.165
Now.

15:24.591 --> 15:28.004
Fucking pig--
the way he paws at the boy.

15:28.178 --> 15:31.545
The fault lies with Barca
for leaving him.

15:33.225 --> 15:34.465
Is it delivered?

15:34.643 --> 15:36.224
As promised.

15:37.896 --> 15:41.229
A letter to my wife.

15:42.734 --> 15:44.395
Long overdue.

15:46.238 --> 15:47.478
Did you bring a reply?

15:47.656 --> 15:49.897
She did not favor me
with one.

15:50.075 --> 15:53.567
She insisted on bringing you
the message herself.

16:22.274 --> 16:24.105
How did you gain entry?

16:24.276 --> 16:26.767
Your man Ashur spoke to Batiatus
on my behalf.

16:26.945 --> 16:29.561
Did he ask coin
for the service?

16:29.739 --> 16:31.991
He said he would
take the matter up with you.

16:33.827 --> 16:37.115
Who cares of coin
on such a day, eh?

16:40.208 --> 16:42.620
The boy has grown monstrous.

16:46.214 --> 16:48.455
And his mother
ever more beautiful.

16:53.138 --> 16:55.470
I miss the taste of your lips.

16:59.811 --> 17:02.473
The letter came as a surprise.

17:02.647 --> 17:05.138
Every day I prayed for word

17:05.317 --> 17:07.558
and that it would not be news
of your death in the arena.

17:07.736 --> 17:09.897
We agreed--
no letters, Aurelia,

17:10.071 --> 17:13.279
to keep you and the boy
far from this

17:13.450 --> 17:15.031
and my mind on the task.

17:15.202 --> 17:17.818
And what has changed?

17:17.996 --> 17:19.736
A friend.

17:19.915 --> 17:21.155
His loss.

17:22.959 --> 17:24.824
A friend.

17:25.003 --> 17:26.664
You are moved by a friend?

17:26.838 --> 17:30.877
I am moved by the need
to see my wife,

17:31.051 --> 17:32.757
to know she is still real

17:32.928 --> 17:34.839
and not the dream
of a desperate man.

17:37.265 --> 17:39.642
After one more year
my debts will be paid.

17:39.809 --> 17:42.516
We can start again,
all of us together.

17:42.687 --> 17:44.939
We should have just left

17:45.106 --> 17:46.846
to Pompeii or Sicilia.

17:47.025 --> 17:48.515
It would not have been
honorable.

17:48.693 --> 17:50.558
Honor?

17:50.737 --> 17:53.729
Where is the honor in debts
of gambling and chance?

17:53.907 --> 17:57.195
Where is the honor in leaving
your wife and child?

17:58.495 --> 18:02.329
Every mistake I have made
I will set right.

18:02.499 --> 18:05.616
I will be the man you deserve.

18:05.794 --> 18:09.207
From this moment on
my life is yours and yours alone.

18:13.343 --> 18:15.083
lam with child.

18:15.262 --> 18:18.004
Child?

18:23.061 --> 18:24.676
What is your meaning?

18:24.854 --> 18:26.890
- Varro.
- Your meaning.

18:27.065 --> 18:29.932
Your absence
has been difficult,

18:30.110 --> 18:33.853
the money you send barely enough
to keep us fed and sheltered.

18:34.030 --> 18:35.611
Titus offered assistance.

18:36.658 --> 18:38.068
Titus?

18:38.243 --> 18:40.905
An acquaintance
from the marketplace.

18:41.079 --> 18:43.695
And you repay him
by spreading your fucking legs?

18:43.873 --> 18:46.410
No. I thought of him
only as a friend.

18:46.584 --> 18:49.417
- He forced himself upon me.
- Why didn't you stop him?

18:49.587 --> 18:51.578
You think I wanted this?

18:51.756 --> 18:54.919
Where were you, Varro?

18:55.093 --> 18:57.254
Where the fuck were you?

18:59.139 --> 19:01.801
Fighting

19:01.975 --> 19:03.966
for us,

19:04.144 --> 19:05.600
as you should have been.

19:22.412 --> 19:25.495
The House of Batiatus
is filled with champions--

19:25.665 --> 19:27.451
my father's,

19:27.625 --> 19:29.161
my grandfather's.

19:29.336 --> 19:31.702
Soon you will stand among them.
I have commissioned you

19:31.880 --> 19:33.996
to be immortalized in stone
at great expense.

19:34.174 --> 19:35.755
You honor me, Dominus.

19:35.925 --> 19:37.506
Well, the laurels
do not cease there.

19:37.677 --> 19:39.542
Good Mercato has insisted

19:39.721 --> 19:42.178
that Spartacus be moved
to the forefront of his games.

19:42.349 --> 19:44.761
You will take on the guise
of his storied grandfather

19:44.934 --> 19:46.390
Marcus Minucius Rufus.

19:46.561 --> 19:48.176
Rufus?

19:48.355 --> 19:49.811
You know of him?

19:49.981 --> 19:51.767
l have heard his name

19:51.941 --> 19:54.728
spoken by my father
when l was a boy.

19:54.903 --> 19:56.643
You will be dressed
in his very armor,

19:56.821 --> 19:59.654
four of our gladiators
bedecked as Roman legion.

19:59.824 --> 20:01.075
Our enemy?

20:01.242 --> 20:03.324
Six prisoners
sentenced to execution,

20:03.495 --> 20:06.828
clad in the barbaric fashion
of the Thracian hordes of the Maedi.

20:06.998 --> 20:10.661
It will be a grand spectacle,
with you its shining helm.

20:12.545 --> 20:13.705
I will not fight.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.211
You misunderstand.

20:15.382 --> 20:17.418
I do not ask.

20:17.592 --> 20:18.877
I command.

20:19.052 --> 20:20.667
I will not dress as a Roman

20:20.845 --> 20:23.712
and pretend to slaughter
my own people.

20:23.890 --> 20:26.006
It is time for you to release
your hold upon the past.

20:26.184 --> 20:29.301
You are no longer of Thrace.

20:29.479 --> 20:33.848
You are destined for great
and wonderful things, Spartacus.

20:34.859 --> 20:37.942
Embrace the path
the gods have set you upon.

20:38.113 --> 20:40.775
Your mind is clouded by grief.

20:40.949 --> 20:43.691
Pause to clear it.

20:54.587 --> 20:57.203
You bathe me as if a child.

20:57.382 --> 20:59.919
You must rest.

21:00.093 --> 21:01.958
Lie still.

21:02.137 --> 21:04.719
You'll reopen your wounds.

21:07.350 --> 21:09.056
I can't even rise.

21:09.227 --> 21:11.559
In time.

21:12.564 --> 21:14.395
Always the enemy of a gladiator.

21:14.566 --> 21:17.649
Yet a friend to us now.

21:17.819 --> 21:20.652
Domina has given excuse
for us to be together.

21:20.822 --> 21:24.406
Let us pluck blessing
from misfortune.

21:27.579 --> 21:31.913
Crixus, you live,

21:32.083 --> 21:33.994
my prayers answered.

21:34.169 --> 21:36.080
Crixus: lwould have
more prayers

21:36.254 --> 21:38.745
to return me to the sand
to be by the men.

21:38.923 --> 21:40.754
You shall rejoin your brothers
soon enough.

21:40.925 --> 21:42.756
Brothers?

21:42.927 --> 21:44.918
None have visited me,

21:45.096 --> 21:46.711
not even Barca.

21:48.433 --> 21:49.798
Have you not told him?

21:49.976 --> 21:51.841
The moment has not arisen.

21:52.020 --> 21:53.681
Has he fallen in the arena?

21:53.855 --> 21:55.766
Far the opposite.

21:55.940 --> 21:58.101
He has purchased his freedom.

21:59.569 --> 22:01.355
The Beast of Cartage?

22:01.529 --> 22:03.941
What is Barca if not a gladiator?

22:04.115 --> 22:07.733
A man free to roam
outside these walls.

22:07.911 --> 22:09.947
The thought is foreign--

22:10.121 --> 22:13.705
the giant fuck tending goats
and picking vegetables,

22:13.875 --> 22:16.833
with Pietros
his ever-doting wife.

22:17.003 --> 22:18.243
He left the boy.

22:19.255 --> 22:21.507
He'd sooner part
with his own cock.

22:21.674 --> 22:23.505
The news found me
surprised also.

22:23.676 --> 22:26.133
He did not wish it

22:26.304 --> 22:28.966
but had no choice.

22:29.140 --> 22:31.301
You shared words with him?

22:32.310 --> 22:34.016
No,

22:34.187 --> 22:35.848
but I saw it in his eyes

22:36.022 --> 22:38.934
as he was escorted
through the gates.

22:40.610 --> 22:42.271
You were there?

22:47.742 --> 22:49.698
Regain your strength.

22:49.869 --> 22:52.576
I would see you
with a sword in hand soon.

22:58.670 --> 23:00.661
Barca gone,

23:00.838 --> 23:04.581
Spartacus champion--

23:04.759 --> 23:08.468
l have awoken to a world of shit.

23:18.690 --> 23:21.432
You are a fool
to refuse Batiatus.

23:21.609 --> 23:24.225
The man makes
unreasonable demands.

23:24.404 --> 23:27.362
He is your master,

23:27.532 --> 23:29.898
his demands your duty,
unreasonable or otherwise.

23:30.076 --> 23:32.032
I will not be forced
to slaughter my countrymen.

23:32.203 --> 23:33.534
Countrymen in dress only.

23:33.705 --> 23:35.696
You share no kinship
with these prisoners.

23:35.873 --> 23:39.081
They are murderers, rapists,
their death well deserved.

23:39.252 --> 23:41.538
Then let another man's blade
grant it.

23:41.713 --> 23:43.874
You act as if you have
free will in the matter.

23:44.048 --> 23:45.208
You are a gladiator.

23:45.383 --> 23:46.543
I am a Thracian.

23:46.718 --> 23:48.583
You are a slave.

23:48.761 --> 23:51.298
To cling to a life
beyond these walls

23:51.472 --> 23:53.428
is to see your heart
parted from your chest.

23:53.600 --> 23:56.182
You above all others
should know this.

24:02.734 --> 24:05.020
I do not think before I speak.

24:07.572 --> 24:11.235
I will remove myself
to less deserving company.

24:29.636 --> 24:31.172
Pietros.

24:38.019 --> 24:39.304
Gnaeus's hand?

24:41.314 --> 24:42.770
I shall have a word.

24:42.940 --> 24:44.271
To what end?

24:44.442 --> 24:46.398
Will it see Barca return?

24:46.569 --> 24:51.108
Will it see us reunited,
or free as he promised?

24:51.282 --> 24:54.774
Fate often takes a man
far from his heart,

24:54.952 --> 24:56.613
to his regret.

24:56.788 --> 24:59.370
Felt more keenly
by the one left behind.

25:02.960 --> 25:05.702
Rome is positively aflutter
with news of Theokoles's defeat.

25:05.880 --> 25:07.791
No one could believe
such a thing was possible,

25:07.965 --> 25:10.092
especially at the hands
of a Thracian.

25:10.259 --> 25:13.843
The gods truly bless
the House of Batiatus.

25:14.013 --> 25:16.174
We're even entertaining
thoughts of a patron

25:16.349 --> 25:18.431
to share in our good fortune.

25:18.601 --> 25:22.719
Hmm. And does your good fortune
extend downward?

25:22.897 --> 25:24.808
I don't follow.

25:24.982 --> 25:28.315
The priestess--
has her fertility rite born any seed?

25:30.613 --> 25:33.229
l was unable to conclude the rite
in the allotted time.

25:33.408 --> 25:34.693
No.

25:34.867 --> 25:36.653
Well, my husband was
sadly absent.

25:36.828 --> 25:38.113
What of the other man?

25:38.287 --> 25:40.744
You still have not told me
anything about him.

25:40.915 --> 25:42.121
Is it Solonius?

25:42.291 --> 25:44.122
I would rather fuck an eel.

25:46.087 --> 25:47.372
No no.

25:47.547 --> 25:50.960
A woman as beautiful as you are
deserves a man,

25:51.134 --> 25:53.671
someone of position maybe.

25:53.845 --> 25:57.008
- He's no one of note.
- No one of note.

25:57.181 --> 26:00.514
Someone more physical perhaps--
a slave.

26:00.685 --> 26:02.516
Oh, your cup's empty.
Naevia.

26:02.687 --> 26:04.143
It is, isn't it?

26:04.313 --> 26:06.224
But notjust any slave.
No, not for you.

26:06.399 --> 26:09.607
He would have to be forged
by Jupiter himself.

26:09.777 --> 26:11.608
Let us move on
from the subject.

26:11.779 --> 26:15.237
Of course.
To other matters.

26:17.410 --> 26:18.900
How fares Crixus?

26:21.664 --> 26:22.904
Crixus?

26:23.082 --> 26:25.915
His injuries
suffered against Theokoles--

26:26.085 --> 26:27.541
is he expected to live?

26:27.712 --> 26:29.998
His strength returns.

26:30.173 --> 26:31.834
Joyous news.

26:32.008 --> 26:34.715
It would be a great tragedy
to see such a man

26:34.886 --> 26:38.049
pass from this world,
would it not?

26:38.222 --> 26:40.213
It would.

26:40.391 --> 26:43.383
A pity he will not take the sand
in good Mercato's games.

26:43.561 --> 26:47.179
I long to see his sword
thrust home.

26:52.695 --> 26:55.027
How did you fare?

26:55.198 --> 26:57.689
The game of dice and bones.

26:59.202 --> 27:02.535
Poorly, as I often have.

27:02.705 --> 27:05.242
I will balance the loss
at the next chance.

27:05.416 --> 27:07.953
(birds cooing)

27:09.045 --> 27:12.208
It would seem Pietros
has lost control of his flock.

27:23.851 --> 27:25.512
Pietros.

27:32.944 --> 27:35.151
The boy has freed himself.

27:53.798 --> 27:55.413
Gnaeus!

28:04.350 --> 28:06.261
Enough.

28:10.565 --> 28:12.351
What is this foolishness?

28:15.444 --> 28:18.277
Pietros.

28:18.447 --> 28:20.233
The boy took his own life.

28:26.163 --> 28:29.200
He will be missed,

28:29.375 --> 28:31.832
especially his lips
around my cock.

28:57.778 --> 29:01.487
This morning | boasted
the top retiarius in all of Capua.

29:01.657 --> 29:03.568
Now I possess
nothing more

29:03.743 --> 29:06.325
than bones and brains
scattered upon the rocks.

29:06.495 --> 29:07.655
Apologies.

29:07.830 --> 29:09.866
Fuck your apologies!

29:11.792 --> 29:14.044
I will have return
of the value lost.

29:14.211 --> 29:16.748
The price of the man will be
subtracted from your winnings

29:16.923 --> 29:19.881
- until the remainder is balanced.
- As you see fit, Dominus.

29:20.051 --> 29:21.962
All of this for what?

29:22.136 --> 29:23.842
Pietros?

29:24.013 --> 29:26.004
He was nothing,
shit from a whore.

29:26.182 --> 29:28.548
He was a man.
His life had worth.

29:28.726 --> 29:30.136
Half a coin at most.

29:30.311 --> 29:32.518
Gnaeus was a gladiator.

29:32.688 --> 29:37.148
Years of training,
each mounting to exorbitant cost--

29:37.318 --> 29:39.354
that is true worth.

29:39.528 --> 29:41.234
He did not deserve to live.

29:43.866 --> 29:45.948
I alone decide who lives,

29:46.118 --> 29:47.983
not you, not a fucking slave!

29:49.747 --> 29:51.408
( groans )

29:54.961 --> 29:57.247
My generosity
has been boundless,

29:57.421 --> 30:00.083
yet you defy me still.

30:01.092 --> 30:04.334
Mercato's games are upon us.

30:04.512 --> 30:08.300
I expect you to fight
as a loyal Roman

30:08.474 --> 30:12.058
or die as a Thracian.

30:15.314 --> 30:17.691
See him to the medicus.

30:32.790 --> 30:35.031
You shed tears for the boy?

30:35.209 --> 30:37.120
His passing saddens me.

30:37.294 --> 30:40.661
He was too weak
for this place

30:40.840 --> 30:43.047
without Barca
to protect him.

30:43.217 --> 30:45.458
Not all of us can be strong.

31:00.985 --> 31:03.397
Have you been
making friends again?

31:03.571 --> 31:05.482
Gnaeus.

31:05.656 --> 31:07.442
A disagreement.

31:07.616 --> 31:10.028
And you emerged
the battered cunt.

31:10.202 --> 31:13.160
What, did his tiny net prove
too fierce an opponent

31:13.330 --> 31:15.457
for the slayer of Theokoles?

31:15.624 --> 31:17.125
Ask the man himself,

31:17.293 --> 31:20.000
if you can scrape enough of him
off the cliff for reply.

31:20.171 --> 31:22.412
Gnaeus is dead?

31:22.590 --> 31:24.956
What reason did you have
to take his life?

31:27.053 --> 31:29.920
My reasoning lies
forever silent.

31:30.097 --> 31:33.555
Your actions betray us all.

31:33.726 --> 31:36.342
Gnaeus was a gladiator,
a brother.

31:36.520 --> 31:38.101
He was no brother of mine.

31:38.272 --> 31:39.557
When you swore the oath,

31:39.732 --> 31:41.814
every man in here
became your brother

31:41.984 --> 31:44.350
deserved of an honorable death
in the arena.

31:44.528 --> 31:49.022
Your actions shame
my fighting beside you.

31:49.200 --> 31:51.236
You speak as if you had choice
in the matter.

31:51.410 --> 31:53.025
ldid.

31:53.204 --> 31:56.571
And I chose
not to end your life in the arena--

31:56.749 --> 31:59.536
a decision
I presently regret.

32:02.379 --> 32:04.370
As do |.

32:04.548 --> 32:06.709
(birds cooing)

32:16.894 --> 32:19.431
You knew Pietros well?

32:19.605 --> 32:21.516
Only in passing.

32:21.690 --> 32:24.853
Yet you tend to his pets--
a duty not required.

32:25.027 --> 32:26.608
A foolish gesture.

32:26.779 --> 32:29.111
Born of a kind heart.

32:30.407 --> 32:32.784
lt surprises

32:32.952 --> 32:35.318
that Barca would claim
his freedom,

32:35.496 --> 32:38.112
yet leave the things he loved
in captivity.

32:41.585 --> 32:44.668
Did he speak to you of his plans
for life outside the ludus?

32:44.839 --> 32:47.080
No.

32:49.093 --> 32:52.130
Did he exchange words
with Ashur?

32:53.764 --> 32:55.379
Ashur?

32:55.558 --> 32:57.014
He was there, was he not?

32:57.184 --> 32:59.345
I do not recall.

33:00.938 --> 33:04.681
Surely, if you set your mind
to the task.

33:04.859 --> 33:07.692
Apologies, but I must return
to the villa.

33:07.862 --> 33:09.318
Domina awaits.

33:09.488 --> 33:12.275
The fear in your eyes

33:12.449 --> 33:14.360
betrays the lie on your tongue.

33:14.535 --> 33:17.777
Your questions
put me in harm's way.

33:17.955 --> 33:20.947
Please let me pass.

33:26.755 --> 33:27.084
(groaning)

33:27.089 --> 33:28.829
(groaning)

33:30.301 --> 33:33.885
The day approaches
when I'm finally free of this.

33:34.054 --> 33:37.137
Perhaps you can fashion
a proper cock from it.

33:37.308 --> 33:38.468
( men laugh )

33:38.642 --> 33:40.633
Remove yourselves.

33:41.687 --> 33:44.019
Remain.

33:48.527 --> 33:50.768
I seek information.

33:50.946 --> 33:53.062
- On what subject?
- Barca.

33:53.240 --> 33:56.528
I understand he made wager
upon the Theokoles fight.

33:56.702 --> 34:00.661
Yeah, and won a small fortune
applied towards his freedom.

34:00.831 --> 34:02.492
With no thought to Pietros?

34:03.542 --> 34:05.578
Not enough coin remained
to liberate him.

34:05.753 --> 34:06.993
Hmm.

34:07.171 --> 34:08.661
Barca's eyes filled with tears,

34:08.839 --> 34:12.206
though spurred by regret
or impending freedom,

34:12.384 --> 34:15.000
I know not.

34:16.013 --> 34:19.255
It is a stirring sight
to see the bonds of servitude lifted.

34:19.433 --> 34:22.175
Mm, I confess
my eyes swimming

34:22.353 --> 34:24.389
as Barca took leave
of the villa.

34:26.857 --> 34:29.018
Who else offered farewells?

34:29.193 --> 34:31.935
Only our master and myself.

34:35.532 --> 34:39.400
Naevia claims to have
escorted Barca to the gates.

34:41.497 --> 34:43.362
She made no mention
of your presence.

34:43.540 --> 34:44.916
( chuckles )

34:45.084 --> 34:46.790
Why, she's a simple thing.
Her mind--

34:46.961 --> 34:51.079
Stories in conflict
give me concern.

34:51.257 --> 34:54.841
If I find there is more to the matter
of Barca's departure...

34:57.763 --> 34:59.845
we shall have words.

35:08.899 --> 35:11.231
(Sura laughing)

35:21.453 --> 35:23.569
You still believe in them--

35:23.747 --> 35:25.738
the gods?

35:27.501 --> 35:29.492
Yes.

35:29.670 --> 35:31.331
Why?

35:35.092 --> 35:38.584
Our entire village is gone,

35:38.762 --> 35:41.424
everyone we knew dead.

35:42.766 --> 35:45.508
If there are no gods,

35:45.686 --> 35:49.770
there is nothing to shape
what happens in our lives

35:49.940 --> 35:52.522
and there is no meaning
to any of it.

36:00.284 --> 36:03.697
I cannot believe the gods
would lead me to you,

36:03.871 --> 36:07.784
to bless me with such love,

36:07.958 --> 36:10.870
only to make me bear witness
to your suffering.

36:11.920 --> 36:13.501
No.

36:13.672 --> 36:15.537
There is a deeper purpose

36:15.716 --> 36:17.672
to the path
you've been set upon,

36:17.843 --> 36:19.834
one that has yet
to reveal itself.

36:22.014 --> 36:25.472
I would never see you
from my side again.

36:25.642 --> 36:29.134
Without you
there is no reason for breath.

36:29.313 --> 36:31.144
There is always
a reason to live.

36:31.315 --> 36:32.646
I would be lost.

36:32.816 --> 36:34.647
No.

36:36.737 --> 36:39.353
The gods would set you
on the proper path.

36:41.533 --> 36:45.196
All you have to do
is close your eyes

36:45.371 --> 36:48.579
and place yourself
in their hands.

37:02.221 --> 37:04.337
We leave for the games.

37:04.515 --> 37:06.631
Is your decision made?

37:07.976 --> 37:09.807
It is.

37:13.857 --> 37:15.848
What sort of answer is this?

37:18.278 --> 37:20.269
A gesture.

37:24.368 --> 37:26.199
I care not
for its means of delivery.

37:26.370 --> 37:29.203
Perhaps its meaning
will be more agreeable.

37:29.373 --> 37:31.364
Out with it then.

37:35.212 --> 37:39.296
Sura spoke often to me
of the gods.

37:39.466 --> 37:41.127
She believed in them.

37:41.301 --> 37:43.553
I never truly have.

37:43.720 --> 37:45.585
( harrumphs)

37:45.764 --> 37:47.675
The cock on you,

37:47.850 --> 37:49.966
daring to doubt the gods.

37:50.144 --> 37:53.181
And l have
suffered much for it.

37:53.355 --> 37:54.811
But no longer.

37:54.982 --> 37:58.224
From this point forward

37:58.402 --> 38:01.735
I give myself over
to her beliefs

38:01.905 --> 38:04.396
and embrace my fate.

38:05.409 --> 38:09.402
Your words give my heart
greatjoy,

38:09.580 --> 38:11.320
enough even
to erase questions

38:11.498 --> 38:13.489
of how a blade belonging
to the magistrate's son

38:13.667 --> 38:16.283
came to your possession.

38:18.255 --> 38:21.964
Let us put the past
truly behind us.

38:22.134 --> 38:25.001
Come.
The games await you.

38:25.179 --> 38:27.886
l have but one condition.

38:28.056 --> 38:29.921
Condition?

38:30.100 --> 38:32.762
You kiss my cheek
only to finger my ass?

38:32.936 --> 38:34.767
Speak

38:34.938 --> 38:38.101
before I carve out
your fucking tongue.

38:38.275 --> 38:42.359
I will take to the sands
against the specter of my countrymen,

38:42.529 --> 38:43.939
but I will face them alone.

38:44.114 --> 38:46.947
Six to your one?

38:47.117 --> 38:49.779
I will not risk the champion of Capua
to such absurdity.

38:49.953 --> 38:52.285
If this is my fate,

38:52.456 --> 38:56.244
if this is the path the gods
have truly set me upon,

38:56.418 --> 38:57.919
then they will not
see me fall.

38:58.086 --> 38:59.792
And if you are wrong?

39:01.798 --> 39:06.292
Then I will give your city
a great spectacle of blood

39:06.470 --> 39:08.711
before joining my wife.

39:14.853 --> 39:18.266
The gods have brought you
this far.

39:20.108 --> 39:22.485
I believe they are not done
with you yet.

39:22.653 --> 39:25.486
But I have a condition
of my own.

39:25.656 --> 39:27.897
When you have killed
the last of these shits

39:28.075 --> 39:29.656
garbed as your countrymen,

39:29.826 --> 39:33.694
what's left of the Thracian inside you
dies with them

39:33.872 --> 39:36.488
and you will embrace this fate

39:36.667 --> 39:39.329
and your destiny as Spartacus,

39:39.503 --> 39:42.040
the champion of Capua.

39:42.214 --> 39:44.500
( crowd cheering )

39:58.397 --> 40:00.854
( booing )

40:19.960 --> 40:22.076
Citizens of Capua...

40:24.256 --> 40:26.918
today we honor

40:27.092 --> 40:31.426
the noble
Marcus Minucius Rufus,

40:31.597 --> 40:33.713
a Roman consul
and commander

40:33.890 --> 40:37.348
unmatched in glory.

40:37.519 --> 40:39.680
As tribute,

40:39.855 --> 40:41.595
good Mercato has seen fit
to reenact

40:41.773 --> 40:44.981
his grandfather's
most famous victory

40:45.152 --> 40:48.064
against the Thracian hordes.

40:48.238 --> 40:51.230
( cheering )

40:57.247 --> 40:59.488
Gaze at the prisoners
standing before you

40:59.666 --> 41:03.534
and imagine the Thracian Maedi
that invaded Macedonia,

41:03.712 --> 41:06.374
raping and pillaging
its noble people,

41:06.548 --> 41:08.755
murdering all in their path,

41:08.925 --> 41:11.302
even a Roman governor.

41:11.470 --> 41:14.086
( booing )

41:18.769 --> 41:23.103
Violence and madness
swept the land,

41:23.273 --> 41:25.855
echoing into the heavens

41:26.026 --> 41:28.984
where the gods themselves
turned their backs.

41:29.154 --> 41:31.065
All seemed lost

41:31.239 --> 41:36.108
until Rome dispatched
its favored son.

41:36.286 --> 41:39.870
Enter Marcus Minucius Rufus!

41:40.040 --> 41:43.703
( crowd clapping rhythmically )

41:44.711 --> 41:46.793
For the honorable role
of Rufus,

41:46.963 --> 41:49.454
there was but one choice--

41:49.633 --> 41:52.466
the bringer of rain,

41:52.636 --> 41:55.503
the slayer of Theokoles,

41:55.681 --> 41:57.967
the champion of Capua!

41:58.141 --> 41:59.472
Man: Stand up!

41:59.643 --> 42:03.135
Batiatus: I present to you

42:03.313 --> 42:04.644
Spartacus!

42:09.069 --> 42:13.984
( chanting )
Spartacus! Spartacus! Spartacus!

42:25.210 --> 42:27.667
I thought it was your grandfather
we honor.

42:27.838 --> 42:31.877
Yet the crowd chants
"Spartacus."

42:32.050 --> 42:34.427
Worry not of details,
good Mercato.

42:34.594 --> 42:37.722
The glory is
your grandfather's alone.

42:37.889 --> 42:39.675
Come,

42:39.850 --> 42:43.092
give the signal to begin
the glorious victory.

42:43.270 --> 42:46.808
In honor of
Marcus Minucius Rufus,

42:46.982 --> 42:48.938
let blood be shed.

43:11.381 --> 43:13.838
Sura's voice: All you have to do
is close your eyes

43:14.009 --> 43:16.000
and place yourself
in their hands.

43:41.912 --> 43:43.493
(grunts)

44:10.273 --> 44:12.104
(yelling)

44:44.140 --> 44:45.801
Yeah!

45:07.831 --> 45:10.868
You do realize
my grandfather won this battle?

45:11.042 --> 45:14.330
Perhaps this day
history will not repeat itself.

45:41.865 --> 45:44.572
Sura's voice: There is always
a reason to live.

45:44.743 --> 45:47.359
The gods would set you
on the proper path.

46:32.082 --> 46:34.744
He fights
like a man possessed.

46:34.918 --> 46:37.159
By the gods themselves.

47:05.824 --> 47:08.361
Kill! Kill!

47:16.626 --> 47:20.164
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

47:36.062 --> 47:37.927
Don't.

47:47.532 --> 47:50.820
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

48:29.741 --> 48:31.823
A marvelous show.

48:33.119 --> 48:34.825
An honor to be of service.

48:34.996 --> 48:38.580
( crowd chanting )
Spartacus! Spartacus! Spartacus!

48:51.846 --> 48:56.089
I am Spartacus!

49:02.398 --> 49:04.980
(theme music playing )
