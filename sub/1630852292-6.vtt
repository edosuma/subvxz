middle of the road,

this point, thinking to myself,

"All right, Tyler, you gotta
play to win from now on."

And, listen, I'm not mad
at either of the people

03:43.875 --> 03:46.312

understand the circumstances.

03:46.442 --> 03:50.621
So, hopefully,
not when, not if,

03:50.752 --> 03:53.581

I can operate similarly.

is called Deep Dive.

08:40.649 --> 08:43.740
[applause and whooping]

08:43.870 --> 08:47.875
Down in this cenote
there are four buoys,

08:48.004 --> 08:51.008
and underneath each buoy
there are treasure chests,

08:51.139 --> 08:52.923
15 feet below the water.

08:53.053 --> 08:57.231
Inside the chest
there is a bag of puzzle pieces.

08:57.361 --> 09:00.888
Your goal is to dive down,
open the treasure chest,

09:01.018 --> 09:04.020
retrieve the puzzle pieces,
bring them to shore

09:04.152 --> 09:07.110
and solve the puzzle
as fast as possible.

09:07.241 --> 09:10.158
Now, this is a timed event,

09:10.288 --> 09:13.116
and there are two ways
you can go about doing this.

09:13.248 --> 09:17.251
To begin, you're gonna start
on a 30-foot platform.

09:17.381 --> 09:20.254
When I say go, you can either
jump into the water

09:20.384 --> 09:24.346
or you can climb down a ladder
to the 15-foot platform,

09:24.475 --> 09:25.520
then jump in.

09:25.652 --> 09:27.130
But time is of the essence.

09:27.261 --> 09:29.133
The team to get it done
the fastest

09:29.264 --> 09:32.048
will win today's challenge,
be safe from elimination,

09:32.179 --> 09:35.792
and also be nominating
four players to be on that list

09:35.923 --> 09:38.142
for possible elimination,
all right?

09:38.273 --> 09:40.841
The slowest team is gonna be
our losers for today.

09:40.971 --> 09:43.191
They're going
straight into the Arena with me.

- On land.
- On...

10:10.653 --> 10:12.567
Stop giving the caveats--
we're fine...

10:12.698 --> 10:13.874
- I'm just saying
we're really good on land.
- We're fine.

10:14.004 --> 10:16.005
I'm saying
we're really good, period.

10:16.136 --> 10:17.833
- Orange, orange...
- Can we have a check?

10:17.965 --> 10:19.530
- [bell dings]
- We're good?

10:19.662 --> 10:21.229
- Awesome.
- Yeah, Kendal!

10:21.359 --> 10:23.491
KENDAL: Going underwater,
it's a fear that I have.

10:23.623 --> 10:26.755
I'm able to hold my breath down
to the end of the pool and back,

10:26.886 --> 10:28.322
so I know I can do that part.

10:28.452 --> 10:31.107
It's just gonna be
mind over matter.

10:31.239 --> 10:32.587
I'm the one that sucks
at swimming, chill out.

10:32.719 --> 10:35.155
- That doesn't make me
feel better.
- [laughs]

10:35.286 --> 10:36.940
All right, Laterrian, Kendal,
you ready?

10:37.071 --> 10:38.201
- Yeah.
- Go! [blows horn]

10:38.332 --> 10:41.902
[cheering and applause]

10:46.514 --> 10:49.256
MAN: Ooh, Kendal...

10:49.386 --> 10:50.692
WOMAN:
Go! Go, Kendal!

10:50.823 --> 10:53.477
- [Kendal groaning]
- MAN: You got it?

10:53.609 --> 10:55.610
JODI: When Kendal jumps off,
I can tell right away

10:55.741 --> 10:58.352
that she does not feel good.

10:58.482 --> 11:01.878
[mouthing]

11:02.009 --> 11:04.272
She's injured something,
I can't tell what.

11:04.402 --> 11:06.403
You all right?

11:06.534 --> 11:07.710
[groaning]

11:12.759 --> 11:14.673
LATERRIAN: You all right?
[groaning]
- MAN: Go, LT!

11:20.157 --> 11:22.376
- [groaning]
- All the way, Laterrian!

11:22.506 --> 11:24.292
KENDAL: I'm in so much pain.

11:24.422 --> 11:26.729
My ribs are sore,
I can't catch a breath,

11:26.860 --> 11:29.863
and I'm panicking,
but I need to keep moving.

11:37.173 --> 11:38.784
MAN: Good job, LT!

11:42.745 --> 11:44.312
WOMAN: Come on, Kendal.
You got it, girl.

11:44.442 --> 11:45.966
KENDAL: I'm really trying

11:46.096 --> 11:47.793
to take a deep breath
and I just can't,

11:47.923 --> 11:51.318
and then I hear little Cooper's
voice in my head saying,

11:51.448 --> 11:53.321
"Mom, you just try it,
and you just keep trying it

11:53.451 --> 11:55.715
until you aren't
scared anymore,"

11:55.845 --> 11:57.412
and, like, okay,
it's now or never.

12:05.419 --> 12:07.160
[cheering and applause]

12:22.480 --> 12:25.134
- Kendal!
- [cheering and applause]

12:27.049 --> 12:28.355
That'll toughen you up!

12:29.923 --> 12:32.620
- [panting]
- Almost there.

12:32.751 --> 12:34.187
- Got it?
- Okay.

12:34.317 --> 12:35.928
Why are these so big?

12:36.058 --> 12:37.147
That's what she said.

12:37.278 --> 12:38.888
[Kendal laughs]

12:39.019 --> 12:40.368
[pieces clattering]

12:40.498 --> 12:41.716
There's something
with a little... This guy.

12:41.847 --> 12:43.674
- Yep, right there.
- Okay.

12:43.806 --> 12:45.764
LATERRIAN: Okay...

12:45.894 --> 12:48.071
Kendal and I work together well
when it comes to puzzles.

12:48.201 --> 12:50.421
- That way.
- She's super smart,

12:50.552 --> 12:52.596
and we're putting it together...

12:52.727 --> 12:54.556
KENDAL: I think it's the top,
that's why.

12:54.686 --> 12:57.951
She went from being stressed
and afraid of going underwater

12:58.081 --> 13:01.345
to bossing up,
like I knew that she would.

13:01.475 --> 13:02.738
Yup.

13:02.869 --> 13:03.956
[blows horn]

13:04.086 --> 13:08.351
Holy shit! Aah!
Yeah! Yeah! Huh!

13:09.658 --> 13:11.225
TYLER: My girl's doing great.

13:11.355 --> 13:12.616
I'm fine, it'll be fine.

13:12.748 --> 13:14.227
- Yeah.
- It'll be fine.

13:14.357 --> 13:16.056
- I have a great partner, so...
- Yes, you do.

13:16.186 --> 13:17.708
...I'm not worried about it.
He's a great swimmer.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.232
TYLER: Listen, she's not
the only one nervous.

13:19.363 --> 13:21.669
This is a very tall jump.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.715
My body took a beating
on the last one,

13:23.846 --> 13:26.109
and I just don't wanna chance it
by jumping 30 feet

13:26.240 --> 13:27.719
and hurting myself even more

13:27.850 --> 13:29.198
to where I can't even swim
and complete this, so...

13:29.330 --> 13:31.679
15 feet is where I go--
don't judge me.

13:31.811 --> 13:32.636
- Yeah.
- [chuckles]

13:32.768 --> 13:34.248
[horn blows]

13:34.378 --> 13:36.163
Whoa...!

13:36.293 --> 13:39.774
In my head, I feel like I'm
a beautiful little gazelle

13:39.905 --> 13:41.298
prancing across the Serengeti...

13:41.428 --> 13:44.039
Aah...!

13:44.171 --> 13:45.302
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, dang, Tyler.

13:45.432 --> 13:47.303
...but within reality,

13:47.434 --> 13:50.133
I'm that big, sweaty musk ox
near the pond.

13:50.264 --> 13:52.614
MAN: Oh, she's going down...

13:52.744 --> 13:55.138
WOMAN: Just do it!
You got it, jump out!

13:55.269 --> 13:58.533
- MAN: Nice!
- [woman whoops]

13:58.663 --> 14:00.056
Nice job, Jasmine!

14:07.716 --> 14:08.847
MAN: Nice job, Tyler.

14:10.674 --> 14:12.416
One down!

14:12.547 --> 14:15.375
Tyler is an absolute fish.

14:16.985 --> 14:18.509
I checked behind his ears

14:18.639 --> 14:20.250
to see if he had
those little gill slit things,

14:20.380 --> 14:23.514
little Waterworldthings
behind his ears.

14:23.644 --> 14:26.952
He doesn't, but he can make wake
in the lake.

14:27.082 --> 14:29.042
Good job.

14:29.172 --> 14:31.130
MAN: You got this!

14:41.663 --> 14:44.317
Hey, take, take one more look.

14:44.447 --> 14:46.145
I think Jasmine is
a little rattled at this point,

14:46.275 --> 14:48.495
but I am playing for my life
in this game.

14:48.625 --> 14:50.672
I have to win,
because if I don't,

14:50.802 --> 14:52.892
I can guarantee you my name
is gonna be up for nomination,

14:53.022 --> 14:54.067
so move it, girl!

14:54.197 --> 14:55.459
You got this.

15:01.465 --> 15:04.206
Yeah!
That's a girl!

15:06.470 --> 15:08.298
Yup, good.
Whoo!

15:16.219 --> 15:18.091
Might be upside down.

15:18.221 --> 15:20.135
JASMINE:
Where the fuck do you go?

15:20.267 --> 15:21.355
This isn't-- this isn't right.

15:21.485 --> 15:23.530
JONNA: They are taking forever.

15:23.661 --> 15:25.140
I don't even know
if Jasmine and Tyler

15:25.272 --> 15:26.969
are gonna be able
to finish this,

15:27.100 --> 15:28.710
so I'm a little worried
about her and Tyler.

15:28.840 --> 15:30.407
- And flip it?
- [pieces clattering]

15:30.538 --> 15:32.801
Here we go. Good, good, good.
I'm holding it together.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.150
And then this would go here.

15:35.282 --> 15:38.284
[whistling]

15:38.414 --> 15:40.504
Any time you guys
wanna complete this puzzle,

15:40.634 --> 15:44.029
we're just up here, don't worry
about us, taking in the sights.

15:44.159 --> 15:45.422
- That looks better.
- Okay, now we got...

15:45.552 --> 15:47.684
let's get these guys together.

15:47.816 --> 15:49.121
- Check.
- Check.

15:49.251 --> 15:50.993
- We're good.
- [horn blows]

15:51.124 --> 15:52.341
- [cheering and applause]
- WOMAN: Finally.

15:52.472 --> 15:54.039
It isn't over yet.
It's not over yet.

15:54.169 --> 15:55.432
Not over yet. We did great.
Tried our hardest.

15:55.562 --> 15:57.390
Fuck!

15:57.520 --> 15:58.870
All right, Nehemiah and Melinda,
are you ready?

15:59.000 --> 16:00.480
- Let's go.
- [blows horn]

16:07.313 --> 16:08.836
WOMAN: Go, Melinda!

16:08.967 --> 16:12.667
Working with Nehemiah is
a definite advantage to me.

16:12.797 --> 16:15.408
Nehemiah was on my season
ofReal World: Austin with me,

16:15.538 --> 16:17.149
and we've always had
a closeness.

16:17.279 --> 16:18.759
We will definitely be
the team to beat.

16:21.806 --> 16:24.287
NEHEMIAH: Melinda is
not only keeping pace,

16:24.418 --> 16:26.375
but she might even be swimming
faster than me.

16:31.076 --> 16:33.948
I could not be happier for
how well Melinda's performing

16:34.080 --> 16:35.690
and how well we're doing
as a team.

16:38.213 --> 16:40.346
- [pieces clattering]
- This, this...

16:41.739 --> 16:43.653
I think we have it upside-down.

16:43.784 --> 16:46.091
Right here... yup.

16:48.094 --> 16:50.096
- Check.
- Check!
- [blows horn]

16:50.225 --> 16:51.619
- [applause]
- WOMAN: Nice work.

16:53.403 --> 16:55.100
Whoo!

16:55.230 --> 16:56.927
You know what? This is our first
chance really working together,

16:57.058 --> 16:59.365
and I couldn't be any happier.

16:59.495 --> 17:00.932
I feel like we both
pulled our own weight,

17:01.062 --> 17:02.977
and I have the life shield, um,

17:03.109 --> 17:04.761
so today I knew
I was safe regardless,

17:04.893 --> 17:06.286
but I wanted to bust my ass

17:06.415 --> 17:08.505
to make sure
that he gets to be safe.

17:08.635 --> 17:10.681
We can just put in who we want
and get it...

17:10.811 --> 17:12.291
ourselves even further
in this game.

17:13.641 --> 17:15.295
JODI: He's gonna jump first,
I'm gonna jump second,

17:15.424 --> 17:16.991
and we're just gonna go
as fast as we possibly can

17:17.123 --> 17:18.471
with the swimming
and the puzzle.

17:18.602 --> 17:20.125
I mean, that's all we can do.

17:20.256 --> 17:21.648
BRAD: Yeah.
That and great communication

17:21.778 --> 17:22.779
should take us to the win,
hopefully.

17:22.911 --> 17:24.086
- Let's get it.
- Yeah.

17:24.217 --> 17:26.000
All right, Brad and Jodi,
you ready?

17:26.132 --> 17:27.523
[horn blows]

17:27.654 --> 17:28.699
[grunts]

17:33.095 --> 17:34.227
Let's go, Brad!

17:52.288 --> 17:53.375
[grunts]

17:53.507 --> 17:55.074
MEN: Nice!

17:55.203 --> 17:56.814
Good job!

17:56.944 --> 18:01.776
Brad and Jodi
are absolutely smoking it.

18:01.905 --> 18:03.994
Brad... I don't know
how he's doing it.

18:04.125 --> 18:07.041
His beard alone should sink him
to the bottom of the cenote.

18:07.173 --> 18:09.479
When that thing gets water in
it, it's like swimming around

18:09.609 --> 18:11.394
with a damn bowling bowl
on his chin.

18:11.525 --> 18:13.830
- MJ: Jodi's beating
the boys again, huh?
- WOMAN: Uh-huh.

18:13.961 --> 18:17.965

18:38.421 --> 18:39.727
going faster
than we're going right now,

18:39.856 --> 18:41.510
but I just wanna keep
a good pace

18:41.642 --> 18:43.644
so that nobody has a chance

18:53.261 --> 18:54.349
I don't think
we've ever been partners.

18:54.480 --> 18:56.656
- You're gonna find out.
- [laughs]

18:56.787 --> 18:58.746
I will not let
Cohutta down today.

18:58.875 --> 19:01.749
I got a lot of faith
in my Casey Cooper right here,

19:01.878 --> 19:03.924
her ability to jump
and puzzle...

19:04.055 --> 19:05.926
- so I think
we're gonna do great.
- Yeah.

19:06.057 --> 19:08.146
All right, Casey, Cohutta,
you ready?

19:08.277 --> 19:10.410
[horn blows]

19:12.238 --> 19:16.023
I am not good at height things,

19:16.154 --> 19:18.026
but I know
that a 15-foot platform

19:18.156 --> 19:21.334
is basically the middle dive
when I go to the swimming pool,

19:21.463 --> 19:23.727
and I've done that dive
a million times.

19:23.857 --> 19:25.729
COHUTTA: Come on, babe!

19:25.859 --> 19:28.863
Whoo!

19:28.992 --> 19:30.430
[cheering and applause]

19:40.308 --> 19:42.136
I feel great
with this partnership with Casey

19:42.268 --> 19:44.530
because I think
that she needs somebody

19:44.661 --> 19:46.271
to keep her
confidence levels up,

19:46.402 --> 19:48.273
and that's exactly
what I'm gonna try to do.

19:49.797 --> 19:52.538
- Good job, girl.
- Good job, Casey.

19:58.587 --> 20:00.547
Pull it!

20:01.765 --> 20:03.201
There it is.

20:03.332 --> 20:05.682
I don't think Cohutta
gets enough credit

20:05.813 --> 20:09.772
for how smart he is and
how good he is under pressure.

20:09.903 --> 20:11.818
Right here.

20:11.949 --> 20:13.864
Hold that together.

20:13.994 --> 20:17.085
He is an excellent partner,
and if he can do this puzzle,

20:17.215 --> 20:19.608
all the better,
because I am fatigued.

20:19.740 --> 20:21.349
Yeah.

20:21.480 --> 20:23.003
- Check!
- [horn blows]

20:23.134 --> 20:25.093
- Yeah!
- [laughs]

20:25.223 --> 20:26.747
[cheering and applause]

20:26.876 --> 20:29.183
- Well done, girl! [laughs]
- Way to go.

20:30.532 --> 20:32.317
TECK:
It's always important to win,

20:32.448 --> 20:33.927
it's always important to be on
top, so we're going for the win.

20:34.057 --> 20:35.669
Got a life shield,
but I'm still nervous.

20:35.798 --> 20:37.626
I'm nervous for my girl, so...
you know what I mean?

20:37.758 --> 20:39.193
Anything to keep her out,
we're gonna be doing it, so...

20:39.325 --> 20:40.194
Let's do this.

20:40.326 --> 20:42.153
Ayanna, Teck, you ready?

first challenge as a team,

20:54.077 --> 20:56.124
and I'm already
almost killing my partner.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.344
I mean, I didn't mean to jump
on your head, I'm sorry.

20:58.473 --> 21:00.040
I, I tried to jump
in the water but...

21:00.171 --> 21:01.346
you just happened to be
in the way.

21:01.477 --> 21:02.695
My bad.

- Good job, Ayanna.
- Good job, girl!

is definitely Teck and Ayanna.

21:23.717 --> 21:25.066
I threw Teck in last week,

21:25.195 --> 21:26.633
so he gonna throw me
right back in there.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.157
TECK: We got 'em!

trying to figure out

21:48.959 --> 21:51.092
how to put it all together,
but Teck is a whiz.

21:51.221 --> 21:52.484

I don't like to talk too much.

the most nervous about jumping,

22:05.976 --> 22:07.673
so let's just get
that part over with

22:07.804 --> 22:09.936

so we can finish this thing.

That's what it is.

24:25.071 --> 24:26.160
It was inevitable
that I was gonna get Ayanna.

24:26.289 --> 24:27.814
I've known her
for over 20 years,

24:27.943 --> 24:29.945
and I have to say
that I'm happy I did.

24:30.076 --> 24:32.383
The only thing with Ayanna
is that she's a wild card.

24:32.513 --> 24:34.603
You don't know if you're
gonna get Ayanna or Tayanna,

24:34.733 --> 24:36.386

I can be like Michael Jordan

I'm frustrated, to be honest,

24:55.667 --> 24:57.712
because I showed up,
I've worked hard,

24:57.844 --> 24:59.846
but, listen,
it's never over till it's over.

24:59.976 --> 25:01.978

and encourage me to swim.

a little bit bad about Tyler,

25:32.051 --> 25:35.403
but I wish Tyler would have been
a little bit more aggressive

about choosing someone who could
potentially be at his level.

25:39.972 --> 25:40.973

that this is not something

25:41.104 --> 25:43.366

to the end of the game,

26:00.863 --> 26:02.385
and the important thing
right now

26:02.517 --> 26:03.997
is not just keeping yourself
safe from elimination,

26:04.126 --> 26:06.086

from elimination,

is gonna be between us.

26:40.294 --> 26:42.164

26:42.296 --> 26:46.386
So, Brad, Jodi, you are now
safe from elimination.

26:46.517 --> 26:49.259
Now I need you to go back
to the villa, deliberate

26:49.390 --> 26:53.175
and nominate two teams
to send into the Arena.

26:53.307 --> 26:56.527
We won, we're safe,
we get to nominate names,

26:56.657 --> 27:00.096
but also watch and learn the way
that all of this plays out,

27:00.227 --> 27:02.142
so Jodi and I are definitely
off to a good start.

27:02.271 --> 27:04.317
Now, what that means
for our life shield holders--

27:04.448 --> 27:08.496
Teck, Melinda--
that you can still save someone,

27:08.626 --> 27:12.239
but by saving them, you're also
saving their new teammate.

27:12.368 --> 27:13.848

the life shield?

27:35.435 --> 27:38.656
Okay, so, because there's
two life shields in play,

27:38.787 --> 27:41.963
now that we're partnered
with people,

27:42.095 --> 27:44.575
say Melinda and Nehemiah's name
goes on the board,

27:44.705 --> 27:45.837
they're both safe.

27:45.968 --> 27:48.188
So, say Nehemiah
and Melinda's name

27:48.317 --> 27:49.231
- go on the board along with...
- She saves the team.

27:49.363 --> 27:50.972
Hold on, hold...
Teck and Ayanna's.

27:51.104 --> 27:53.061
Mm-hmm. They both
can save themselves...

27:53.192 --> 27:55.281
- So they save theirselves...
- ...and they can throw in
whoever they want.

27:55.412 --> 27:57.153
- ...and then he puts in
two new names.
- Yes. Two new teams.

27:57.284 --> 27:58.285
- Yeah, two new teams.
- Both teams are safe.

27:58.414 --> 27:59.939
Both teams are safe.

28:00.068 --> 28:01.417
DARRELL: This game has
changed a lot now,

28:01.548 --> 28:03.246
because we're not just
throwing in individuals,

28:03.376 --> 28:04.943
we are throwing in pairs.

28:05.074 --> 28:07.119
So therefore there's only
five teams to pick from.

28:07.250 --> 28:08.817
So now we're getting down
to the nitty-gritty.

28:08.948 --> 28:10.210
Then burn them shits.

28:10.339 --> 28:12.080
But then if you burn
the life shields,

28:12.211 --> 28:13.778
there's only gonna be, like,
two people voting.

28:13.909 --> 28:15.388
Think about it:

28:15.519 --> 28:16.738
the winners can't vote,
the losers can't vote.

28:16.868 --> 28:18.260
MJ: So we have the numbers.

28:18.392 --> 28:20.001
In that case, yes.

28:20.133 --> 28:22.482
JONNA: I'm starting to get
a little bit nervous,

28:22.613 --> 28:25.877
because now that four people
from the other alliance

28:26.008 --> 28:27.662
have life shields,
they're now safe.

28:27.792 --> 28:29.316
What are Brad and Jodi gonna do?

28:29.445 --> 28:31.273
There's not very many teams
to choose from.

28:31.404 --> 28:34.146
One of us is gonna
definitely have to go in.

28:34.277 --> 28:36.497
[dramatic music]

28:40.021 --> 28:42.459
So, the first thing
that we have discussed

28:42.589 --> 28:45.070
and we already need to do
is to burn up the life shields.

28:45.201 --> 28:47.115
- Right.
- There's not
a lot of names left.

28:47.247 --> 28:48.682
It's nothing personal
at this point.

28:48.814 --> 28:50.292
So how do we burn these things,
we just light 'em on fire?

28:50.423 --> 28:51.730
Mm-hmm.
Hang Teck and his partner

28:51.859 --> 28:53.557
and then Melinda
and her partner.

28:53.688 --> 28:55.603
BRAD: It's very important
to flush the life shields,

28:55.733 --> 28:58.258
because if you don't, those
individuals will get a vote

28:58.387 --> 29:00.739
and can ultimately determine
the outcome of the decision,

29:00.868 --> 29:03.262
so by tying up Teck and Ayanna

29:03.393 --> 29:04.742
and then Melinda
and Nehemiah's votes,

29:04.873 --> 29:05.655
we should be able to make sure

29:05.787 --> 29:07.180
that Laterrian and Kendal go in.

29:07.309 --> 29:08.921
Laterrian and Kendal
are the people

29:09.050 --> 29:10.226
I have the least amount
of rapport with,

29:10.356 --> 29:12.445
so it's nothing personal
at this point.

29:12.576 --> 29:14.273
- JODI: Hey, guys.
- TECK: What's up, what's up?

29:14.403 --> 29:16.363
So, I mean,
you guys probably already...

29:16.492 --> 29:18.191
- I'm assuming
you expected this.
- We did, so...

29:18.320 --> 29:20.540
JODI:
And when you save yourself,
you save your partner, so...

29:20.671 --> 29:22.891
- TECK: Yeah.
- I mean, obviously
we're gonna save ourselves.

29:23.021 --> 29:24.109
- Yes, of course, of course.
- So... uh...

29:24.240 --> 29:26.199
we're getting
too close to the final here

29:26.328 --> 29:28.548
to have it any other way, but...
we wanna be here.

29:28.679 --> 29:30.463
- TECK: Yup.
- So...

29:30.594 --> 29:32.465
There's nothing that I can do
at this point

29:32.596 --> 29:34.423
to be able to save
Kendal and Laterrian.

29:34.555 --> 29:36.077
Cheers.

29:36.209 --> 29:37.471
MELINDA: Puts us
in a really crappy position,

29:37.601 --> 29:40.343
because we're going to
probably be losing numbers.

29:40.473 --> 29:42.432
You got this, Brad.

29:42.563 --> 29:44.130
Brad feels very strongly

29:44.259 --> 29:46.348
about Laterrian and Kendal
being up for selection,

29:46.480 --> 29:49.788
and then we're gonna put MJ and
Jonna up just as a burn vote.

29:49.917 --> 29:51.746
They will not get voted for,

29:51.876 --> 29:53.748
we've already run the numbers
to make sure that they're safe.

29:55.315 --> 29:57.796
- Hi-yo...!
- Surprise, surprise.

29:57.925 --> 30:01.582
This is the first time
in my Challengecareer

30:01.711 --> 30:05.586
to be thrown in
and kind of feel okay about it.

30:05.715 --> 30:06.760
Something could go wrong.

30:06.892 --> 30:08.327
MJ:
I truly feel like,

30:08.458 --> 30:09.938
with the numbers being
what they are,

30:10.068 --> 30:11.461
Jonna and I will be safe

30:11.592 --> 30:13.681
and make it through
this nomination process.

30:13.811 --> 30:16.509
But all it takes
is one or two of our people

30:16.640 --> 30:17.816
to stab us in the back.

30:19.861 --> 30:22.167
- Yeah, big dog on there.
- What, what, what? Damn...

30:22.298 --> 30:23.865
One... I knew
it was gonna be one of 'em,

30:23.996 --> 30:25.387
but I thought it would be, uh...

30:25.519 --> 30:28.217
- Yeah, big dog on there.
- I wonder why.

30:28.347 --> 30:30.872
NEHEMIAH: Laterrian and Kendal,
MJ and Jonna.

30:31.002 --> 30:33.308
TECK: Your buddies. [laughs]

30:33.440 --> 30:34.615
-This is chess.
- JASMINE: This is chess
right here.

30:34.744 --> 30:37.400
It ain't no checkers.
[laughs]

30:37.530 --> 30:39.184
Let's go.

30:39.315 --> 30:41.796
These are not people
that I wanna go against.

30:41.926 --> 30:45.104
Like, Kendal's strong
and I love Jonna. This sucks!

30:49.107 --> 30:52.938
- Hey, hey, hey...
- What's wrong?
What's wrong, doll?

30:53.067 --> 30:53.852
- Grr...
- Oh, careful, careful.

30:53.981 --> 30:55.983
What's wrong?

30:56.115 --> 30:57.898
Um... I don't know if you saw

30:58.029 --> 31:00.292
when I hit the water,
like, sideways.

31:00.423 --> 31:02.034
I could feel, like,
this whole thing,

31:02.163 --> 31:03.557
like, just, you know,
push in like that,

31:03.686 --> 31:05.689
and now, like,

31:05.819 --> 31:09.867
you can see this rib is out
and this one is not,

31:09.998 --> 31:12.434
and it just is, like...
it doesn't hurt,

31:12.566 --> 31:14.915
but it, it's hard to take
deep breaths.

31:15.047 --> 31:16.787
As the day is progressing,

31:16.917 --> 31:20.400
I realize that I'm hurt a little
bit more than I thought I was.

31:20.529 --> 31:22.663
I have a connective
tissue disorder,

31:22.792 --> 31:26.579
I dislocate joints frequently,
and my ribs get displaced,

31:26.710 --> 31:30.845
which makes me concerned that
maybe there's a bigger issue.

31:30.976 --> 31:34.413
Anyway, they said they could...

31:34.544 --> 31:35.849
take me to the hospital,

31:35.980 --> 31:38.156
which I do not want to do.

31:38.287 --> 31:40.462
- It could be nothing...
- Right. Right.

31:40.594 --> 31:42.290
...and if it's nothing,
it's fine,

31:42.422 --> 31:44.163
you continue to play the game.

31:44.292 --> 31:46.556
If it's something,
you get it taken care of.

31:46.686 --> 31:47.949
Yeah.

31:58.046 --> 32:00.048
LATERRIAN: Knowing that Kendal
was going to the hospital,

32:00.179 --> 32:01.396
I start to worry about her,

32:01.528 --> 32:03.398
not as part of this game--
fuck the game.

32:03.529 --> 32:05.575
I'm just thinking
about her health.

32:05.705 --> 32:07.837
And I know that it's
something serious because...

32:07.969 --> 32:09.752
she's a tough son of a gun.

32:21.113 --> 32:23.244
[intense, driving music]

32:33.733 --> 32:35.083
I think the moves we made
are pretty standard.

32:35.213 --> 32:36.519
We did borrow
one from you, Casey,

32:36.650 --> 32:38.391
with tying up the life shields.

32:38.520 --> 32:40.261
Other than that, we did the best
we could with just, you know,

32:40.393 --> 32:42.089
the options we had
in front of us.

32:42.221 --> 32:44.179
JONNA: I'm getting
a little worried,

32:44.309 --> 32:46.573
because the plan is to put
in Laterrian and Kendal,

32:46.702 --> 32:49.228
but Kendal is not even here
to plead her case,

32:49.357 --> 32:50.750
so are they still gonna
follow through

32:50.881 --> 32:52.273
with the plan that we discussed?

32:52.404 --> 32:54.406
I do know that Tyler
is a giant-slayer,

32:54.537 --> 32:55.885
he's proved it over and over,

32:56.017 --> 32:58.498
but I'm not ready to go in there
against him yet.

32:58.627 --> 32:59.890
[laughter]

33:00.020 --> 33:02.849
Don't vote for me, guys.
That's all I got.

33:02.980 --> 33:04.721
I've never shied away from going
against the biggest, baddest,

33:04.852 --> 33:07.420
because my heart
don't pump Kool-Aid.

33:07.549 --> 33:11.641
LATERRIAN: MJ and Jonna
had zero chance of going in,

33:11.771 --> 33:13.817
because not only
did Brad and Jodi

33:13.948 --> 33:16.732
take away Melinda's and Teck's
life shields,

33:16.864 --> 33:19.823
they can't vote either,
so it only leaves

33:19.953 --> 33:22.478
a certain amount of people
that are gonna be able to vote.

33:22.608 --> 33:24.175
It is nothing personal,
Laterrian,

33:24.306 --> 33:26.178
I absolutely adore you.

33:26.307 --> 33:28.048
I will be voting
for you and Kendal

33:28.180 --> 33:30.311
pending that she does return.

33:30.442 --> 33:32.357
It sucks. I mean,
I admire the way you play,

33:32.488 --> 33:35.622
but my vote'll be for you
and Kendal, Laterrian.

33:35.751 --> 33:37.405
Got it.

33:37.537 --> 33:38.580
- I'm sorry, Laterrian.
- Don't apologize...

33:38.711 --> 33:40.539
- You and Kendal.
- ...don't apologize.

33:40.670 --> 33:42.193
Well... [sighs]

33:42.324 --> 33:44.847
Looks like we're a dying breed,
us Road Rulers,

33:44.979 --> 33:49.417
so I have to vote
for MJ and Jonna.

33:49.548 --> 33:51.420
My vote
don't even really matter,

33:51.550 --> 33:52.813
LT and Kendal got
most of the votes already,

33:52.942 --> 33:54.249
but I just can't vote for them.

33:54.380 --> 33:57.035
- Cool.
- [applause]

34:00.472 --> 34:01.821
I can't wait till tonight.

34:01.951 --> 34:03.824
Lord God, I can't wait
till tonight.

34:03.953 --> 34:06.869
I have a feeling I'm gonna be
very sore after this.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.481
[laughs]
Geez...

34:19.753 --> 34:21.623
JASMINE:
Don't give me that look.

34:21.755 --> 34:23.061
This is hard.

34:23.190 --> 34:24.800
Girl... you got this.

34:24.931 --> 34:27.934
[tearfully]
I fucking hate elimination.

34:29.806 --> 34:32.112
Kendal's no joke, she's a beast.

34:32.244 --> 34:33.679
Yeah.

34:33.809 --> 34:36.422
I've been in a million
David-and-Goliath moments

34:36.552 --> 34:38.684
in my Challengehistory.

34:40.469 --> 34:41.469
[bleep]

34:42.775 --> 34:44.038
- [horn blows]
- Yeah!

34:44.168 --> 34:45.126
Whoo!

34:45.257 --> 34:46.518
[grunting and panting]

34:46.648 --> 34:48.737
Not giving up yet.
I'm not giving up.

34:48.869 --> 34:53.742
To finally pull a win out
and just have that happen...

34:53.873 --> 34:56.311
would feel so good.

34:56.442 --> 34:57.965
I always say,
"Oh, I'm closing this chapter

34:58.096 --> 34:59.313
of my Challengelife."

34:59.445 --> 35:01.141
I want to end the book...

35:01.273 --> 35:03.797
- [laughs]
- ...with just going
to the damn final.

35:03.927 --> 35:06.581
[sighs]

35:10.717 --> 35:12.719
LATERRIAN: The thing
about the Kings' Palace

35:12.849 --> 35:17.202
and the love that I get from
Melinda and Teck and Nehemiah

35:17.331 --> 35:19.726
is unmatched in this house.

35:19.856 --> 35:21.902
Keeping this experience going
is amazing...

35:22.032 --> 35:24.338
but I didn't come here
to have a good time.

35:24.469 --> 35:28.213
I came to bust people's ass,
win this money, go home.

35:30.128 --> 35:33.173
I am not afraid
to go up against anyone.

35:33.304 --> 35:35.088
People know
myChallenge history

35:35.219 --> 35:38.135
of going against some of
the bigger hitters in the game.

35:38.266 --> 35:40.398
[people shouting]

35:40.528 --> 35:41.617
[horn blows]

[horn blows]

35:45.664 --> 35:47.231
[people cheering and whistling]

35:47.362 --> 35:50.409
Congratulations, Johnny
and Tyler, pulling it out.

35:50.539 --> 35:53.411
I'm thinking to myself,
you know, anything's possible.

35:53.541 --> 35:55.327
[dramatic music]

36:07.382 --> 36:10.820
All right, everyone,
welcome back to the Arena.

36:10.951 --> 36:14.128
[applause]

36:14.259 --> 36:16.826
First things first.
We gotta get some players.

36:16.956 --> 36:19.438
So we'll start off with the
losers from the last challenge.

36:19.568 --> 36:20.786
Tyler, come on out.

36:26.445 --> 36:28.097
And Jasmine.

36:33.713 --> 36:35.889
Now we gotta get 'em
some opponents,

36:36.018 --> 36:38.456
so players that you selected
go against our losers.

36:38.586 --> 36:40.023
Laterrian, come on out.

36:45.768 --> 36:47.943
And you selected Kendal.

36:48.074 --> 36:50.643
MAN: Oh, shit.

36:50.773 --> 36:54.690
Unfortunately, she is
medically unable to continue...

36:54.820 --> 36:57.215
so she is out
for the rest of the season.

36:57.344 --> 36:58.911
MAN: Whoa.

36:59.041 --> 37:01.523
My heart just drops.

37:01.653 --> 37:03.132
You know what it's like?

37:03.264 --> 37:04.960
Just before the game
is about to start,

37:05.092 --> 37:06.614
they announce your starting
quarterback's gonna be out.

37:06.746 --> 37:10.052
Now, what that means for you,
Jasmine...

37:11.228 --> 37:12.795
...you're off the hook.

37:12.925 --> 37:16.190
[cheering and applause]

37:16.320 --> 37:18.496
We're still gonna have an
elimination tonight, gentlemen.

37:18.626 --> 37:20.934
You're not off the hook.

37:21.063 --> 37:23.065
So, Jasmine, why don't you
go ahead and stand over there?

37:23.197 --> 37:24.329
Wait and see
if you're gonna have

37:24.458 --> 37:26.025
the same partner you came with

37:26.155 --> 37:27.983
or if you're gonna get
a new one. Go ahead.

37:28.114 --> 37:29.420
[applause]

37:29.550 --> 37:31.030
JASMINE:
Oh, my God, I'm so happy

37:31.161 --> 37:32.250
I don't have to do this.

37:32.380 --> 37:34.251
Kendal, I'm so sorry

37:34.382 --> 37:35.643
that you're medically,
like, outta the game.

37:35.775 --> 37:37.255
I love you.

37:37.385 --> 37:39.081
If I win this Challenge,
like, I swear to God,

37:39.213 --> 37:41.389
I'm taking you somewhere
really freaking nice

37:41.519 --> 37:43.739
or I'm gonna name my third child
after you-- something.

37:45.393 --> 37:47.221
TYLER: This is tough,

37:47.351 --> 37:50.485
and this is no shade meant
towards Jasmine or anything,

37:50.615 --> 37:53.619
but we lost as a pair,

37:53.748 --> 37:57.710
and I definitely held up my end
of the bargain, but it's on me.

37:57.840 --> 37:59.581
I should have been
more proactive

37:59.711 --> 38:02.541
and started
curating partners day one

38:02.670 --> 38:04.193
like everyone else did
in this game.

38:04.324 --> 38:07.110
All right, gentlemen,
tonight you are playing a staple

38:07.240 --> 38:10.592
in All Star elimination.

38:10.722 --> 38:13.507
This is
the original head-banger...

38:13.639 --> 38:16.336
- Pole Wrestle.
- [exclaiming]

38:16.467 --> 38:19.514
To begin, you're both gonna
take your place on that pole.

38:19.644 --> 38:22.211
When I say go,
you will push, pull,

38:22.342 --> 38:25.085
or pry that pole
out of your opponent's hands.

38:25.215 --> 38:27.391
The first one to win
two out of three rounds

38:27.521 --> 38:30.264
will win tonight's elimination
round and stay in the game.

38:30.394 --> 38:32.744
Losers go home empty-handed.

38:32.875 --> 38:35.487
You came a long way, you don't
want to go home now, guys.

38:35.617 --> 38:38.228
- Let's get it done. Good luck.
- [applause]

38:40.927 --> 38:43.059
I did not expect this one, um,
but I'm excited.

38:43.190 --> 38:45.931
Uh, I like to wrestle,
I've had really good results

38:46.061 --> 38:47.802
when I use body weight
against opponents,

38:47.934 --> 38:50.023
so I'm gonna try, you know,
a little stutter step.

38:50.152 --> 38:51.677
You can almost taste
that finish line.

38:51.806 --> 38:53.418
I... it's, like,
right in front of me.

38:53.547 --> 38:57.596
I was not expecting
another pole wrestle ever again

38:57.726 --> 38:59.467
Go!

39:07.257 --> 39:09.434
I'm not gonna
underestimate my opponent.

39:09.563 --> 39:11.914
If I can go out here and win and
make an example out of Tyler,

39:12.045 --> 39:13.306
then I'm going to fucking do it.

39:13.438 --> 39:15.831
TJ:
All right, boys, you ready?
