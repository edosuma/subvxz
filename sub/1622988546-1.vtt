00:58.591 --> 00:59.422
Yes, yes.

00:59.424 --> 01:03.341
You're listening to
Atlanta station's, IYF 89.5

01:04.435 --> 01:05.266
I got one at home that I know loves me.

01:07.709 --> 01:09.430
You know that's right.

01:09.432 --> 01:11.711
My time's almost up, folks.

01:11.713 --> 01:13.862
And we'll be letting DJ Hershey take over.

01:13.864 --> 01:16.492
He'll be waking you up
with everything you need

01:16.494 --> 01:17.844
and a little bit more.

01:17.846 --> 01:20.352
I'm gonna wrap this thing
out with my theme song,

01:20.354 --> 01:23.340
"Last Night a D.J. Saved my Life".

01:23.342 --> 01:26.612
Watch out for those energy vampires.

01:26.614 --> 01:29.062
You know hurt people, hurt people.

01:29.064 --> 01:32.981
It's your lover boy, Tony
Sinclair signing out.

01:34.195 --> 01:36.612
You're listening to IYF 89.5.

01:45.265 --> 01:47.825
I listened to you on the way in.

01:47.827 --> 01:48.658
Hot.

01:48.660 --> 01:49.729
Oh, thanks man.

01:49.731 --> 01:50.839
Glad you liked it.

01:50.841 --> 01:51.672
Liked it?

01:51.674 --> 01:52.591
I loved it.

01:53.753 --> 01:55.268
Tony, you really got a hang of this.

01:55.270 --> 01:58.024
I wish my paycheck reflect that.

01:58.026 --> 02:02.568
I want that stupid bread,
like G Smooth over at BBX 105.

02:02.570 --> 02:04.272
Your time will come.

02:04.274 --> 02:06.637
Just keep doin' what you're doin'.

02:06.639 --> 02:09.887
He didn't get to where he was overnight.

02:09.889 --> 02:10.721
I know.

02:10.723 --> 02:15.203
Hell, been at this hole in
the wall station for 10 years,

02:15.205 --> 02:17.907
and I still ain't got my big break.

02:17.909 --> 02:18.740
10 years.

02:19.575 --> 02:20.408
Yeah.

02:23.509 --> 02:24.339
Well, you have a good show, man.

02:29.491 --> 02:31.658
All right, got everything.

02:32.981 --> 02:33.814
Stay up.

03:35.936 --> 03:36.936
Hey, baby.

03:37.866 --> 03:38.843
You're late.

03:38.845 --> 03:39.676
Late?

03:39.678 --> 03:40.808
What are you talking about?

03:40.810 --> 03:44.745
I came straight home after the station.

03:44.747 --> 03:45.832
Can I get a kiss now that you got rid

03:45.834 --> 03:47.751
of that morning breath?

03:50.848 --> 03:54.763
Apparently you didn't get
rid of that late night breath.

03:54.765 --> 03:57.416
Look, I need to talk
to you about something.

03:57.418 --> 03:58.455
What?

03:58.457 --> 03:59.624
This shift of yours.

03:59.626 --> 04:01.352
Like, the only time I
get a chance to see you

04:01.354 --> 04:02.468
is when I'm leaving from work,

04:02.470 --> 04:04.251
and when your ass is
getting home from work.

04:04.253 --> 04:05.084
So you know what?

04:05.086 --> 04:06.980
I don't think this is going to work.

04:06.982 --> 04:08.507
Plus, I need you to
start bringing more money

04:08.509 --> 04:09.581
into this crib.

04:09.583 --> 04:12.051
Look, Christine don't start.

04:12.053 --> 04:13.634
I just got in, damn.

04:13.636 --> 04:14.467
Oh really?

04:14.469 --> 04:16.517
Well, these didn't.

04:16.519 --> 04:17.353
What?

04:18.540 --> 04:19.495
What's this?

04:19.498 --> 04:22.182
Let's see, we have the electric bill.

04:22.184 --> 04:23.530
We have the cable bill.

04:23.532 --> 04:25.615
And we have the gas bill.

04:27.199 --> 04:28.038
Gas bill?

04:28.040 --> 04:30.515
This is a totally electric apartment.

04:30.517 --> 04:31.574
You get my point.

04:31.576 --> 04:33.754
Look, I don't know why you tripping.

04:33.756 --> 04:35.530
I'm out here hustling.

04:35.532 --> 04:36.537
I got a job interview tomorrow.

04:36.539 --> 04:37.484
Where?

04:37.486 --> 04:38.884
BBX 105.

04:39.719 --> 04:40.865
Yeah, that's right.

04:40.867 --> 04:44.103
We gonna be trading that
hooptie for a Benz real soon.

04:44.105 --> 04:46.257
So I don't know why, what's your problem?

04:46.259 --> 04:50.743
If I have to tell you,
then don't worry about it.

04:50.745 --> 04:51.578
What?

04:56.310 --> 04:57.143
Really?

05:56.275 --> 05:58.744

Hey man, listen.

06:14.377 --> 06:16.651
Let me hold somethin'.

06:16.653 --> 06:18.919
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.

06:18.921 --> 06:21.421
That's what I'm talkin' about.

06:22.739 --> 06:23.989
Oh, 20 square!

06:26.118 --> 06:26.976
Man, you want the rest of my orange?

06:26.978 --> 06:27.816

You hear me?

06:35.539 --> 06:36.462

06:36.464 --> 06:39.147
Don't ever forget that.

All right.

06:41.328 --> 06:42.161
Hey, man.

06:43.165 --> 06:44.998
Get your damn head up.

07:14.222 --> 07:15.819
Oh, damn.

Okay, cool, cool.

07:25.611 --> 07:26.554
That's what's up.

07:26.556 --> 07:27.479
Yeah.

07:27.481 --> 07:32.231
I just dropped off my air
check to your program director.

07:33.343 --> 07:34.965
Good luck with that, man.

07:34.967 --> 07:37.565
I would love it, if you
check it out, you know.

07:38.400 --> 07:40.578
I'd love to work here.

07:40.580 --> 07:43.185
You said you dropped it off to my PD?

07:44.020 --> 07:44.851
Yeah, yeah yeah.

07:44.853 --> 07:46.680
Greg Harris.

07:46.682 --> 07:47.513
Okay, man.

07:47.515 --> 07:49.182
Good luck with that.

08:32.287 --> 08:34.576
What are you doing?

08:34.578 --> 08:36.600
Come on, I'm about to go to work.

08:36.602 --> 08:38.102
Man, get off me.

08:47.141 --> 08:49.513
Come on, baby.

08:49.515 --> 08:51.903
Tony, I am trying to sleep.

08:51.905 --> 08:52.738
Move.

08:55.191 --> 08:56.024
Damn.

09:28.086 --> 09:30.919
Turn that light out.

09:33.892 --> 09:35.399
You're listening to the quiet storm.

09:35.401 --> 09:37.730
I'm your main man, Tony Sinclair.

09:37.732 --> 09:40.101
Let's take another call.

09:40.103 --> 09:41.381
Yo, finally I got through.

09:41.383 --> 09:43.290
Tony, I'm trying to get
tickets to the concert, man.

09:43.292 --> 09:44.123
What's up?

09:44.125 --> 09:45.542
What's happening?

09:46.579 --> 09:47.890
Not yet.

09:47.892 --> 09:49.142
Try back later.

09:52.206 --> 09:53.336
Next caller, you're on the air.

09:53.338 --> 09:54.255
Talk to me.

09:55.462 --> 09:57.327
Hey, Tony. Yeah.

09:57.329 --> 09:58.802
All them slow jams is cool.

09:58.804 --> 10:01.202
But how about some Li'l Boostie, baby?

10:01.204 --> 10:02.035
Yeah.

10:02.037 --> 10:03.120
You heard me?

10:04.349 --> 10:06.940
This ain't the trap hour, baby.

10:06.942 --> 10:08.569
You're listening to the quiet storm.

10:08.571 --> 10:09.861
You heard me?

10:13.586 --> 10:15.119
Next caller.

10:15.121 --> 10:16.959
What's on your mind?

10:16.961 --> 10:18.104
Hi Tony.

10:18.106 --> 10:19.247
Am I on the air?

10:19.249 --> 10:20.080
Yes, love.

10:20.082 --> 10:21.832
What's your question?

10:23.809 --> 10:25.294
Well, I've been in a relationship

10:25.296 --> 10:28.129
with this guy for quite some time.

10:30.052 --> 10:34.322
And it just doesn't
seem to be working out.

10:34.324 --> 10:35.673
What do you mean?

10:35.675 --> 10:40.425
Well, it just doesn't seem
like we're on the same page.

10:42.238 --> 10:44.738
Sometimes he really scares me.

10:45.829 --> 10:49.954
Should I stay in this
relationship or move on?

10:49.956 --> 10:52.863
When he touches me, I don't feel safe.

10:52.865 --> 10:55.487
Love should make you feel safe.

10:55.489 --> 10:59.499
If you feel that way, then
maybe it's time to move on.

10:59.501 --> 11:00.687
You think so?

11:00.689 --> 11:01.689
I know so.

11:02.823 --> 11:04.404
Thank you, Tony.

11:04.406 --> 11:08.323
Just hang in there,
love. It'll be all right.

11:13.258 --> 11:16.063
You're on the air with Tony Sinclair.

11:16.065 --> 11:18.418
What can I do for you?

11:18.420 --> 11:21.788
Tony, it's Christine.

11:21.790 --> 11:23.790
You mean my Christine?

11:24.964 --> 11:26.588
Yes.

11:26.590 --> 11:29.403
Oh. Hey y'all, it's the love of my life.

11:29.405 --> 11:32.508
My baby Christine, calling
to give me a shout out.

11:32.510 --> 11:33.477
What's up, baby?

11:33.479 --> 11:35.048
Well you know,
you told that last caller

11:35.050 --> 11:36.251
that she needs to move on?

11:36.253 --> 11:37.084
Yeah.

11:37.086 --> 11:37.917
Well, I'm getting ready

11:37.919 --> 11:40.235
to do the very same thing, boo boo.

11:40.237 --> 11:41.873
It's done.

11:41.875 --> 11:42.708
What?

11:43.952 --> 11:45.630
Baby, stop playing.

11:45.632 --> 11:47.049
Look, I'm gone.

12:37.221 --> 12:41.437
♪ Tell me the truth ♪

12:41.439 --> 12:46.439
♪ Before I give my barbecue to you ♪

12:46.972 --> 12:51.972
♪ Oh tell me the truth ♪

12:52.924 --> 12:57.482
♪ Before I give my barbecue to you ♪

12:57.484 --> 12:59.376
That's not how the song goes, pop.

12:59.378 --> 13:00.240
You want some meat?

13:00.242 --> 13:01.948
No, I'm good.

13:01.950 --> 13:04.208
Man, it's your favorite.

13:04.210 --> 13:05.623
You want any?

13:05.625 --> 13:06.458
Nah.

13:07.410 --> 13:08.496
I know you ain't all in your feelin' bad

13:08.498 --> 13:11.748
with girl on the radio last night, huh?

13:15.500 --> 13:17.568
All the barbecue in Atlanta,

13:17.570 --> 13:20.312
and you in a love zone
about that little girl?

13:20.314 --> 13:22.922
I ain't never like her, no.

13:22.924 --> 13:24.174
Man, look here.

13:27.340 --> 13:30.704
Don't you realize you Louis
Eugene Sinclair's grandson.

13:30.706 --> 13:31.683
Huh?

13:31.685 --> 13:32.661
Well then say it.

13:32.663 --> 13:34.995
I'm Louis Eugene Sinclair's grandson.

13:34.997 --> 13:36.528
Act like it, then, huh?

13:36.530 --> 13:37.363
Okay?

13:43.745 --> 13:45.084
Y'all light skin people something else.

13:45.086 --> 13:45.917
Man, cut that out.

13:45.919 --> 13:47.136
Quit babying the boy.

13:47.138 --> 13:48.471
James, please.

13:49.346 --> 13:51.549
I knew I should've sent
your butt to Southern.

13:51.551 --> 13:53.546
- You want some toast?
- Instead of Morehouse.

13:53.548 --> 13:54.643
No.

13:54.645 --> 13:55.476
You sure?

13:55.478 --> 13:56.728
No. I'm good.

13:58.395 --> 13:59.226
Let me get something for you.

14:02.798 --> 14:03.629
Wait a minute.

14:03.631 --> 14:04.462
What's on the phone?

14:04.464 --> 14:06.870
What's on the phone?

14:06.872 --> 14:08.083
I know that isn't your little girl.

14:08.085 --> 14:09.350
Nah, I just have stuff to do.

14:09.352 --> 14:10.400
Look here, I need to talk to you.

14:10.402 --> 14:11.233
I need-

14:11.235 --> 14:12.402
- Okay, honey.

14:13.818 --> 14:14.649
Love you.

14:14.651 --> 14:15.482
Love you too.

14:15.484 --> 14:17.134
Be good, okay?

14:17.136 --> 14:19.321
I need to talk to you, man.

14:19.323 --> 14:20.528
I need to talk to you, come on.

14:20.530 --> 14:23.613
- What is it?
- I need to talk to you.

14:24.460 --> 14:25.414
Look it, man.

14:25.416 --> 14:26.619
Before you leave, let me talk to you.

14:26.621 --> 14:27.452
Let me talk to you.

14:27.454 --> 14:28.736
What's up, pop?

14:28.738 --> 14:30.738
I need some gas money.

14:32.323 --> 14:33.323
I got you.

14:37.461 --> 14:39.715
That's all you got?

14:39.717 --> 14:40.548
Come on, man.

14:42.994 --> 14:43.825
What?

14:43.827 --> 14:45.410
What are you doing?

14:46.296 --> 14:49.410
You do this every time
I come over here, pop.

14:49.412 --> 14:50.243
Don't worry about it, son.

14:50.245 --> 14:52.093
That's all right.

14:52.095 --> 14:52.928
Love you.

14:53.928 --> 14:55.345
Man, you crazy.

14:56.242 --> 14:57.385
Cool crazy.

14:57.387 --> 14:58.218
I'll see you later, man.

18:49.842 --> 18:51.606
No, that's that classic Armani.

18:51.608 --> 18:53.004
Ooh, nice.

18:53.006 --> 18:55.638
Man, I remember when you

Wow, congratulations.

You're my little girl.

Do I know you?

21:03.837 --> 21:06.975
I mean, you trying to get with me?

21:06.977 --> 21:10.316
You really don't know who I am, do you?

21:10.318 --> 21:11.568
I wish I did.

21:12.683 --> 21:16.183
About six months ago, you saved my life.

21:17.329 --> 21:18.412
I did what?

21:19.278 --> 21:20.278
I'm Robin.

21:24.080 --> 21:25.052
Robin?

21:25.054 --> 21:26.557
I don't know any Robins.

21:26.559 --> 21:28.448
Okay, you remember the
night your girlfriend

21:28.450 --> 21:31.795
dumped you live on the air
for the whole world to hear?

21:31.797 --> 21:34.467
On the radio station, you remember that?

21:34.469 --> 21:35.427
Yeah.

21:35.429 --> 21:38.515
I'm the one who called
in right before her.

21:38.517 --> 21:40.131
I was in an abusive relationship,

21:40.133 --> 21:42.332
and I was really struggling
with getting out.

21:42.334 --> 21:46.592
And you gave me the advice,
and courage, to leave.

21:54.315 --> 21:55.664
Damn.

21:55.666 --> 21:57.369
I did that?

21:57.371 --> 21:58.621
Yes, you did.

22:00.981 --> 22:02.192
I don't know what to say.

22:02.194 --> 22:03.388
Well, I want you to say you'll let me

22:03.390 --> 22:05.760
take you out for dinner,
or lunch, or something.

22:05.762 --> 22:07.862
I mean, like, I really have to show you

22:07.864 --> 22:11.577
how much I appreciate what you did for me.

22:11.579 --> 22:13.011
You don't have to do that.

22:13.013 --> 22:15.235
Give me your phone.

22:15.237 --> 22:16.443
Give me.

22:16.445 --> 22:18.028
Give me your phone.

22:25.390 --> 22:27.057
You just don't know.

22:28.194 --> 22:29.027
Here.

22:32.983 --> 22:33.816
Thank you.

22:35.984 --> 22:37.484
Have a good night.

22:42.850 --> 22:44.342
Neighbor.

22:44.344 --> 22:46.080
What's going on?

22:46.082 --> 22:47.082
Hey, Sade.

22:48.683 --> 22:50.601
Look, I'm telling you and everybody.

22:50.603 --> 22:52.028
I am not Sade.

22:52.030 --> 22:54.025
She's the singer.

22:54.027 --> 22:55.232
I'm from Alabama.

22:55.234 --> 22:56.651
My name is Sadie.

22:58.004 --> 22:59.728
Want something to drink?

22:59.730 --> 23:00.980
No, I'm good.

23:02.939 --> 23:03.856
Oh, well.

23:05.085 --> 23:07.085
You want something else?

23:08.360 --> 23:10.688
Girl, you better stop playing.

23:10.690 --> 23:12.856
I'm not playing.

23:12.858 --> 23:13.775
I'm good.

23:16.917 --> 23:18.167
You sure are.

23:53.678 --> 23:56.128
You liked that, Princess, don't you?

23:56.130 --> 23:56.961
Yeah, girl.

23:56.963 --> 23:59.312
Yo, what's up player?

23:59.314 --> 24:02.013
That's old girl with that

24:02.015 --> 24:02.846
What?

24:02.848 --> 24:03.679
Nah, man.

24:03.681 --> 24:05.600
That's just the dog.

24:05.602 --> 24:06.433
Oh yeah.

24:06.435 --> 24:07.695
I forgot that's the only
bitch you got in your life

24:07.697 --> 24:09.552
since Christine left your ass.

24:09.554 --> 24:10.756
Yo, what you want, D?

24:12.783 --> 24:13.614
Oh, hey.

24:13.616 --> 24:14.447
Let me hit you back.

24:14.449 --> 24:15.280
Hey, hey man.

24:15.282 --> 24:16.432
I just dropped off Keisha, man.

24:16.434 --> 24:17.547
I got them up to freeze.

24:17.549 --> 24:18.380
About to come over your house.

24:18.382 --> 24:20.044
That's cool man, right?

24:20.046 --> 24:21.123
Why not your crib?

24:21.125 --> 24:22.275
Hell, nah.

24:37.551 --> 24:39.262
This is Robin from tonight.

24:39.264 --> 24:41.514
I hope it's not a bad time.

24:42.861 --> 24:43.778
Nah, nah.

24:45.004 --> 24:45.835
Nah, I'm cool.

24:45.837 --> 24:47.260
What's goin' on?

24:47.262 --> 24:48.406
I just wanted to tell you,

24:48.408 --> 24:51.353
thank you once again for all you've done.

24:51.355 --> 24:54.508
And I really do wanna
take you out for lunch.

24:54.510 --> 24:56.323
I still don't feel
like I've done anything.

24:56.325 --> 24:57.156
Oh my gosh.

24:57.158 --> 24:59.177
You just don't know.

24:59.179 --> 25:02.933
Listen, do you like the Surf
Bar and Grill on Monroe?

25:02.935 --> 25:03.766
Yeah.

25:03.768 --> 25:04.599
Yeah, sure.

25:04.601 --> 25:05.557
Okay, well.

25:05.559 --> 25:09.059
How about I meet you there Friday at noon?

25:10.629 --> 25:11.460
You know what?

25:11.462 --> 25:13.545
Let me check my schedule.

25:18.108 --> 25:20.368
What do you think?

25:22.419 --> 25:23.702
Yeah.

25:23.704 --> 25:24.969
Yeah I'll see you there.

25:24.971 --> 25:25.940
Great.

25:25.942 --> 25:27.834
Okay, I guess I will.

25:27.836 --> 25:29.369
Bye.

25:29.371 --> 25:30.204
Right.

25:48.472 --> 25:50.545
I'm old school, brah.

25:50.547 --> 25:52.121
Learn from your elders.

25:52.123 --> 25:53.471
You missed me with that, man.

25:53.473 --> 25:56.322
You're only one minute older than me.

25:56.324 --> 25:58.646
You better chop with all
those blunts, though.

25:58.648 --> 26:00.230
Smoking up more product than you sellin'.

26:00.232 --> 26:01.935
Are you guys twins?

26:01.937 --> 26:02.768
Yes.

26:02.770 --> 26:03.601
How you doin'?

26:03.603 --> 26:04.836
My name's 2P.

26:04.838 --> 26:07.292
This is my brother, Ice.

26:07.294 --> 26:08.828
That the hivs old girl right there?

26:08.830 --> 26:09.661
Robin?

26:09.663 --> 26:11.103
Yeah.

26:11.105 --> 26:14.235
And that's the old boy
from the radio station.

26:14.237 --> 26:15.068
Tony Sinclair?

26:15.070 --> 26:15.987
Yep, yep.

26:16.845 --> 26:18.264
That was hella funny when his girl

26:18.266 --> 26:19.097
dumped him on air, though.

26:19.932 --> 26:20.763
Yeah.

26:20.765 --> 26:22.675
But he came up since then.

26:22.677 --> 26:24.896
So, what old girl now?

26:24.898 --> 26:26.481
She looks like...

26:28.098 --> 26:29.043
I love your polka dots.

26:29.045 --> 26:30.640
Reminds me of Qualmaine.

26:31.475 --> 26:32.306
I'm just playing.

26:32.308 --> 26:33.250
You're gorgeous.

26:33.252 --> 26:34.198
You're gorgeous.

26:34.200 --> 26:35.900
Oh, thank you.

26:35.902 --> 26:38.678
Thank you.

26:38.680 --> 26:40.729
Mr. Sinclair.

26:40.731 --> 26:42.304
Hey.

26:42.306 --> 26:45.986
Well, am I interrupting something?

26:45.988 --> 26:47.071
Not at all.

26:48.373 --> 26:50.873
So, this must be your new...

26:51.768 --> 26:52.601
Whatever.

26:53.830 --> 26:54.661
Intern.

26:54.663 --> 26:57.120
Robin, this is Christine.

26:57.122 --> 26:58.419
Christine.

26:58.421 --> 27:00.002
This is Robin.

27:00.004 --> 27:02.081
Is nice meeting you.

27:02.083 --> 27:02.914
Yes. I'm sure.

27:02.916 --> 27:04.583
Christine.

27:05.749 --> 27:06.582
Christine.

27:07.713 --> 27:08.756
It looks like your friends need you.

27:08.758 --> 27:10.399
Christine.

27:10.401 --> 27:12.401
Get your ass over here.

27:15.042 --> 27:16.875
Have a good evening.

27:18.602 --> 27:20.185
Good night, Tony.

27:27.716 --> 27:29.514
What was that?

27:29.516 --> 27:30.623
I mean, was that real?

27:30.625 --> 27:31.776
I mean, are we being punked?

27:31.778 --> 27:34.226
I mean, like, what's goin' on?

27:34.228 --> 27:38.236
She's just an old friend
from college, that's all.

27:39.364 --> 27:42.110
So, what college did you go to?

27:42.112 --> 27:42.943
Morehouse.

27:42.945 --> 27:43.836
Really?

27:43.838 --> 27:44.901
I went to Spellman.

27:44.903 --> 27:45.734
Really?

27:45.736 --> 27:46.567
Yeah.

27:47.402 --> 27:48.349
What did you major in?

27:48.351 --> 27:49.351
Mass Comm.

27:51.024 --> 27:52.449
Yeah, I can see that.

27:52.451 --> 27:54.282
You're in radio.

27:54.284 --> 27:57.609
Well, I used to have
other plans before that.

27:57.611 --> 27:58.924
Like what?

27:58.926 --> 28:01.436
You know, I wanted
to get into production,

28:01.438 --> 28:03.386
film, make movies.

28:03.388 --> 28:04.248
But.

28:04.250 --> 28:05.946
I got stuck behind a mic.

28:05.948 --> 28:08.561
Well, you know you can
still make that happen.

28:08.563 --> 28:09.896
Nah, I'm good.

28:10.899 --> 28:13.109
You know, I love what I do.

28:13.111 --> 28:15.711
And, not to toot my own horn, but.

28:15.713 --> 28:17.149
I'm pretty good at it.

28:17.151 --> 28:18.401
Yes, you are.

28:20.413 --> 28:22.899
You have no idea how you saved my life.

28:23.999 --> 28:28.082
You keep sayin' that,
but, I just don't get it.

28:30.845 --> 28:33.551
I was about to take my
life that night I called in.

28:33.553 --> 28:34.862
What?

28:34.864 --> 28:38.500
I mean, I know you were in
a bad relationship, but,

28:38.502 --> 28:40.208
there's nothin' worth suicide.

28:40.210 --> 28:41.597
You never know what
you'll do until you're

28:41.599 --> 28:43.340
in that situation.

28:43.342 --> 28:44.259
Believe me.

28:45.654 --> 28:49.259
Things got really crazy
in my relationship.

28:49.261 --> 28:53.420
That night that I called in,
I was about to end it all.

28:53.422 --> 28:58.134
But what you said to me, it
gave me the strength to leave.

28:58.136 --> 29:00.986
Love should make you feel safe.

29:00.988 --> 29:03.197
If you feel that way,

29:03.199 --> 29:05.559
then maybe it's time to move on.

29:05.561 --> 29:08.450
Maybe it's time to move on.

29:08.452 --> 29:10.702
Maybe it's time to move on.

29:11.677 --> 29:13.927
Maybe it's time to move on.

29:15.210 --> 29:18.460
I can never thank you enough.

29:19.470 --> 29:20.303
Wow.

29:25.013 --> 29:27.401
Oh my goodness.

29:27.403 --> 29:30.986
I can't believe that
was such a nice place.

29:31.865 --> 29:32.696
Yeah.

29:32.698 --> 29:33.529
It was cool.

29:33.531 --> 29:35.992
Yes, really cool.

29:36.827 --> 29:39.024
I had a really nice time with you tonight.

29:39.026 --> 29:40.051
And thank you for dropping me off.

29:40.053 --> 29:40.884
You saved me an Uber.

29:41.844 --> 29:44.471
Well, come on, it wasn't a problem.

29:44.473 --> 29:46.665
You know, we should do this again.

29:46.667 --> 29:48.662
I'd like that.

29:48.664 --> 29:51.128
You know, the station's
havin' a meet and greet

29:51.130 --> 29:52.950
at Oceaner's.

29:52.952 --> 29:55.323
Would you like to go?

29:55.325 --> 29:56.599
I don't know.

29:56.601 --> 29:59.288
I need to check my schedule
and then I'll get back to you,

29:59.290 --> 30:00.444
okay?

30:00.446 --> 30:01.279
Yeah.

30:03.337 --> 30:04.168
Gotcha.

30:05.003 --> 30:06.586
What time we goin'?

30:08.422 --> 30:10.172
I'll give you the details tomorrow.

30:11.007 --> 30:12.169
Okay, sounds good.

30:24.458 --> 30:25.522
Good night.

30:25.524 --> 30:26.607
Good night.

30:58.030 --> 30:58.995
Hey, Atlanta.

30:58.997 --> 31:00.469
You know, let me tell you people.

31:00.471 --> 31:02.641
I am feelin' great today.

31:02.643 --> 31:05.455
There's somethin' about
bein' around positive energy,

31:05.457 --> 31:07.720
good vibes and just beautiful people

31:07.722 --> 31:09.536
that makes the world look different.

31:10.371 --> 31:11.327
You know what?

31:11.329 --> 31:12.804
Let's keep this positive energy goin'

31:12.806 --> 31:16.968
and fall way back to "Sweet
Thing" by Chaka Khan.

31:16.970 --> 31:19.451
This goes out to all
my sweet things in ATL.

31:19.453 --> 31:20.921
Especailly one.

31:20.923 --> 31:22.666
She knows who she is.

31:33.628 --> 31:34.706
How you doin'?

31:35.935 --> 31:38.997
Was that shout out for me?

31:38.999 --> 31:42.112
You know that's right.

31:42.114 --> 31:42.947
What's up?

31:44.752 --> 31:45.583
Nothin' much.

31:45.585 --> 31:47.447
You know, just tryin'
to wrap up a few things

31:47.449 --> 31:50.016
so I can leave a little early.

31:50.018 --> 31:50.849
Mm.

31:50.851 --> 31:51.986
We still on for tonight?

31:51.988 --> 31:53.390
Yeah.

31:53.392 --> 31:54.886
I got my nails done.

31:54.888 --> 31:57.909
And now all I need to do
is get my pedicure, honey.

31:58.744 --> 32:00.221
Oo.

32:00.223 --> 32:03.581
You gettin' the hands and
feet ready for a brother?

32:04.462 --> 32:07.100
You go ahead, Spellman
Jaguar, you might fool around

32:07.102 --> 32:08.038
and get bit.

32:08.040 --> 32:10.383
Is that right?

32:13.843 --> 32:14.674
Oh.

32:14.676 --> 32:16.757
Hey, I gotta get back to work.

32:16.759 --> 32:17.590
Okay.

32:17.592 --> 32:19.045
Enjoy the rest of your day.

32:19.047 --> 32:20.947
I look forward to seeing you later.

32:20.949 --> 32:22.231
All right, baby.

32:22.233 --> 32:23.400
Bye.

33:13.438 --> 33:14.626
Robin.

33:14.628 --> 33:16.376
How you doin', baby?

33:16.378 --> 33:18.045
Damn, you look good.

33:19.230 --> 33:20.969
What are you doing here?

33:20.971 --> 33:23.684
I see you just had lunch.

33:23.686 --> 33:25.376
Why don't you come inside and
have a couple drinks with me?

33:25.378 --> 33:27.344
And then we can do dinner later.

33:27.346 --> 33:28.402
I don't think so.

33:28.404 --> 33:29.315
What?

33:29.317 --> 33:31.282
Look, no disrespect, but I
don't think the young lady-

33:31.284 --> 33:34.561
- Ain't nobody talkin' to you.

33:34.563 --> 33:35.519
I said come on.

33:35.521 --> 33:37.373
And I said no.

33:38.232 --> 33:39.063
Get her.

33:55.273 --> 33:57.682
What was that all about?

33:57.684 --> 33:59.289
That was my old boyfriend.

33:59.291 --> 34:00.403
The guy I left.

34:00.405 --> 34:01.788
What?

34:01.790 --> 34:03.146
Do you know who that is?

34:03.148 --> 34:04.207
That's disrespect.

34:04.209 --> 34:05.226
Hendrix.

34:05.228 --> 34:07.728
He's only the biggest
dope dealer in Atlanta.

34:07.730 --> 34:09.746
That's your ex?

34:09.748 --> 34:11.132
Man, what did I get myself into?

34:11.135 --> 34:13.500
It's going to be okay.

34:13.502 --> 34:15.931
Yeah, right.

34:32.876 --> 34:34.532
You want a drink?

34:34.534 --> 34:35.451
I'm good.

34:41.918 --> 34:42.835
Nice place.

34:45.618 --> 34:46.951
You have a maid?

34:48.010 --> 34:50.808
Nah, just a good mama.

34:54.034 --> 34:55.784
Oh, you have a dog?

34:56.974 --> 34:57.805
Yeah, that's-

34:57.807 --> 34:59.071
That's Princess.

34:59.073 --> 35:00.316
She's the lady of the house.

35:05.395 --> 35:06.228
So cute.

35:09.910 --> 35:10.743
Hey, baby.

35:11.650 --> 35:12.483
Aw.

35:15.102 --> 35:16.533
Little different.

35:16.535 --> 35:19.303
You know, most of you guys
have some big ass dogs.

35:20.963 --> 35:23.463
It was for my ex-girlfriend.

35:24.602 --> 35:25.769
Interesting.

35:31.527 --> 35:35.923
Look, you can have my bed
and I'll just chill out here.

35:35.925 --> 35:37.843
No, I don't.

35:37.845 --> 35:40.580
I don't need to sleep in your bed.

35:40.582 --> 35:42.316
I'm fine on the couch.

35:42.318 --> 35:43.149
No.

35:43.151 --> 35:43.991
It's not a problem at all.

35:43.993 --> 35:44.990
No, it's fine.

35:44.992 --> 35:46.196
You sure?

35:46.198 --> 35:47.365
I'm positive.

35:47.367 --> 35:49.548
I'll be just fine right
here on your couch.

35:49.550 --> 35:50.448
You take your bed.

35:50.450 --> 35:51.617
But thank you.

35:52.702 --> 35:53.533
Okay.

35:53.535 --> 35:55.908
Do you have a t-shirt I can borrow?

35:55.910 --> 35:56.911
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:56.913 --> 35:57.746
I gotchu.

36:11.919 --> 36:13.419
I hope this works.

36:14.436 --> 36:16.047
Yeah, that'll work.

36:16.997 --> 36:18.161
I appreciate it.

36:18.163 --> 36:19.320
You just go around the corner.

36:19.322 --> 36:20.153
First door on the left.

36:20.155 --> 36:21.655
Okay, thank you.

36:39.333 --> 36:40.164
What up?

36:40.166 --> 36:41.849
Yo, what's up, freak?

36:41.851 --> 36:43.829
Yo, D, what's goin' on?

36:43.831 --> 36:45.489
I'm tryin' to get up under this brown.

36:45.491 --> 36:47.559
You two following me faster.

36:47.561 --> 36:48.392
For real?

36:48.394 --> 36:49.225
Yeah, man.

36:49.227 --> 36:50.058
Hey, man.

36:50.060 --> 36:51.814
They really wild, man.

36:51.816 --> 36:53.316
Suckin' titties all weekend.

36:53.318 --> 36:55.063
You know what's up, man.

36:55.065 --> 36:58.079
Hey, is that Tony Sinclair from BBX 105?

36:58.081 --> 36:58.912
Hi, Tony.

36:58.914 --> 36:59.745
Hey.

36:59.747 --> 37:00.830
Yeah, that's enough.

37:00.832 --> 37:02.188
Yeah, I told him I know you.

37:02.190 --> 37:04.476
Trying to go through with somethin', boy.

37:04.478 --> 37:06.478
Nah, nah, not tonight.

37:07.470 --> 37:08.308
What you mean "nah, nah"?

37:08.310 --> 37:09.836
They tryin' to get their booty ate.

37:09.838 --> 37:11.200
Didn't you hear that?

37:11.202 --> 37:12.910
Look, man, I've had a crazy night.

37:12.912 --> 37:14.968
That's what we tryin' to have, man.

37:14.970 --> 37:16.053
Come on, dog.

37:19.178 --> 37:20.751
Hey, I'll call you back.

37:20.753 --> 37:23.368
Hey, call me back, dog.

37:23.370 --> 37:24.453
Call me back.

37:25.645 --> 37:26.788
He gonna call me back.

37:26.790 --> 37:28.499
Just had to go take care of some shit.

37:28.501 --> 37:31.519
Make yourself comfortable.

37:31.521 --> 37:32.354
Thanks.

37:33.990 --> 37:35.323
Get some rest.

37:36.733 --> 37:37.566
You too.

39:17.453 --> 39:21.286
I just wanted to give
you a kiss good night.

40:21.882 --> 40:22.713
Hello?

40:22.715 --> 40:24.797
Are you awake?

40:24.799 --> 40:25.757
Yeah.

40:25.759 --> 40:27.509
What happened to you?

40:30.010 --> 40:31.923
I caught a Uber.

40:31.925 --> 40:33.174
I'm home now.

40:33.176 --> 40:35.251
I could've taken you.

40:35.253 --> 40:36.563
You were sleepin' so good,

40:36.565 --> 40:38.565
I didn't wanna wake you.

40:40.927 --> 40:45.240
I had a really nice time
with you last night.

40:45.242 --> 40:47.141
I started thinkin' it was all a dream.

40:48.907 --> 40:50.982
No, it wasn't a dream.

40:50.984 --> 40:51.817
I am real.

40:54.878 --> 40:58.468
In spite of the drama with hendrix.

40:58.470 --> 40:59.458
You sure?

40:59.460 --> 41:00.293
Yeah.

41:01.656 --> 41:04.596
Look, I gotta get ready for work.

41:04.598 --> 41:06.982
I really hope to see you again soon.

41:06.984 --> 41:07.819
Yeah.

41:07.821 --> 41:08.654
Bye.

41:24.117 --> 41:26.105
Hey, Atlanta, you're listenin'
to the midday craziness

41:26.107 --> 41:28.300
of the Tony Sinclair Show.

41:28.302 --> 41:31.618
Today, we're talkin' about
freaky relationships.

41:33.582 --> 41:38.206
In studio today, I have
with me love specialist,

41:38.208 --> 41:39.945
Dr. Jennifer Love.

41:39.947 --> 41:41.283
How you doin', Dr. Love?

41:42.228 --> 41:43.228
Hey, Tony.

41:45.942 --> 41:49.469
We just got finished playin'
"Don't Fight That Feelin'."

41:49.471 --> 41:53.335
What's the importance of being
freaky in a relationship?

41:53.337 --> 41:56.128
Oh, it's super important, Tony.

41:56.130 --> 41:58.663
You see, it's that spice
that keeps a relationship

41:58.665 --> 41:59.832
fresh and new.

42:00.814 --> 42:04.048
No matter how long a
couple's been together.

42:04.050 --> 42:04.926
Oh really?

42:04.928 --> 42:06.210
Oh yes.

42:06.212 --> 42:10.372
See, the worst thing is for
someone to become, you know,

42:10.374 --> 42:11.291
complacent.

42:12.402 --> 42:15.211
Just get stuck in the same, dull, routine.

42:15.213 --> 42:16.260
You think so?

42:18.849 --> 42:19.849
I know so.

42:22.174 --> 42:24.565
You see, what you wanna do, Tony.

42:24.567 --> 42:27.907
You wanna add a little bit of spice.

42:27.909 --> 42:30.159
And a little bit of freaky.

42:32.563 --> 42:34.586
And just see how happy you'll be.

42:34.588 --> 42:38.330
It looks like we got
a caller on the air.

42:38.332 --> 42:39.932
Uh, caller.

42:39.934 --> 42:42.026
Hi, my name is Heather.

42:42.028 --> 42:44.145
Hey, Heather, what's your question?

42:44.147 --> 42:45.871
I'm white and my boyfriend is a black

42:45.873 --> 42:47.540
and upcoming rapper.

42:48.634 --> 42:49.466
Okay?

42:49.468 --> 42:51.245
So what's your question?

42:51.247 --> 42:52.958
He likes me
to call him the N word

42:52.960 --> 42:54.869
when we're making love.

42:54.871 --> 42:56.487
Is that okay?

42:56.489 --> 42:57.739
Well, listen.

42:58.660 --> 43:01.712
As long as you keep it in the bedroom

43:01.714 --> 43:03.214
and within reason,

43:04.565 --> 43:06.873
and if he likes it, then
it's perfectly fine.

43:06.875 --> 43:07.706
See?

43:07.708 --> 43:08.539
That's what's up.

43:08.541 --> 43:09.713
I told you, my nigger.

43:09.715 --> 43:10.548
Okay.

43:11.402 --> 43:13.235
Movin' on to the next caller.

43:13.237 --> 43:14.676
Yeah, I wanna talk about dudes

43:14.678 --> 43:17.375
that get in your relationship business.

43:17.377 --> 43:19.522
Who's all up in your business, man?

43:19.524 --> 43:20.398
I mean.

43:20.400 --> 43:23.093
Dude's that wanna tell a
lady what to do, you know?

43:23.095 --> 43:23.926
Get in a relationship.

43:23.928 --> 43:26.094
Mess things up for a real boss.

43:26.096 --> 43:28.745
What would you do about that?

43:28.747 --> 43:31.058
I guess I'd have to see about that dude.

43:31.060 --> 43:33.671
What about a
DJ that gives bad advice?

43:33.673 --> 43:35.880
And makes a man's girl leave him?

43:35.882 --> 43:37.523
What you think about that?

43:40.172 --> 43:42.032
Well, I guess if he
was lovin' her right,

43:42.034 --> 43:43.085
that woulda never happened.

43:43.087 --> 43:44.946
I guess that's
why your girl dumped your ass

43:44.948 --> 43:45.948
live on air.

43:47.998 --> 43:49.649
We're gonna go to the next caller.

43:49.651 --> 43:50.660
I bet you do, mother-

43:50.662 --> 43:51.493
- You know what?

43:51.495 --> 43:53.656
Why don't we take a break
and when we come back,

43:53.658 --> 43:56.711
we'll get more from Dr. Jennifer Love.

43:56.713 --> 44:01.380
On this Relationship Thursday
on the Tony Sinclair show.

44:03.677 --> 44:04.862
Sorry about that.

44:04.864 --> 44:06.346
Oh, it's no problem, Tony.

44:06.348 --> 44:08.351
See, about that little
problem that you have.

44:08.353 --> 44:12.212
You know, we can always
work some things out.

44:12.214 --> 44:14.631
Let me take good care of you.

44:15.515 --> 44:16.346
Thanks.

44:16.348 --> 44:17.179
Remember.

44:17.181 --> 44:18.012
A little spice.

44:21.808 --> 44:24.858
Let's all go
down and stretch our arms.

44:24.860 --> 44:26.706
All the way down.

44:26.708 --> 44:27.708
And hold it.

44:31.460 --> 44:33.696
And come back up.

44:33.698 --> 44:34.698
And breathe.

44:36.285 --> 44:37.992
Let's do it one more time.

44:37.994 --> 44:39.411
All the way down.

44:41.534 --> 44:42.745
Yo, T.

44:42.747 --> 44:45.642
What's wrong with you man?

44:45.644 --> 44:46.477
T.

44:48.034 --> 44:50.784
Man, my mind is somewhere else.

44:51.868 --> 44:54.426
Yo, what's up, Tony?

44:54.428 --> 44:57.830
Man, these past few days
have been literally insane.

44:57.832 --> 44:59.165
What happened?

45:00.705 --> 45:02.124
Remember that pretty
young thing that came

45:02.126 --> 45:03.271
to the club the other night?

45:03.273 --> 45:04.104
Yeah.

45:04.106 --> 45:05.313
You know that one I ran up to VIP?

45:05.315 --> 45:06.970
Yeah, she was bad as hell.

45:06.972 --> 45:07.803
Should've asked, dude.

45:07.805 --> 45:09.565
What's up with her?

45:09.567 --> 45:12.603
She's more than I want
and more than I need.

45:12.605 --> 45:14.450
Remember that night me
and Christine broke up?

45:14.452 --> 45:16.388
Yeah, she dumped your
ass over the radio man.

45:16.390 --> 45:17.937
The whole city heard you got fried, man.

45:17.939 --> 45:19.606
Yo, can you chill?

45:21.610 --> 45:22.443
Anyway.

45:23.708 --> 45:26.319
She was the girl that called
in right before Christine.

45:26.321 --> 45:27.152
No shit.

45:27.154 --> 45:28.125
Yeah.

45:28.127 --> 45:28.958
Oh, man.

45:28.960 --> 45:30.146
That's crazy.

45:30.148 --> 45:32.085
Yeah, it gets even more crazy.

45:32.087 --> 45:33.915
She was all over you
at the club, though.

45:33.917 --> 45:35.308
Seemed like she wanted to get with you.

45:35.310 --> 45:36.227
She does.

45:37.315 --> 45:41.654
But the dude she broke
up with is Hendricks.

45:41.656 --> 45:42.558
From the Ghetto Boys.

45:42.560 --> 45:43.391
The Ghetto Boys?

45:43.393 --> 45:45.078
Man, they sling all the
dope in Atlanta, man.

45:45.080 --> 45:45.936
What's wrong with you, man?

45:45.938 --> 45:46.769
Dude.

45:46.771 --> 45:48.527
What're you tryin' to tell everybody?

45:48.529 --> 45:49.745
You know, I still can't believe

45:49.747 --> 45:51.937
that girl came the same night.

45:51.939 --> 45:54.327
Christine fired your ass, man.

45:54.329 --> 45:56.348
That shit crazy.

45:56.350 --> 45:57.181
Look.

45:57.183 --> 45:58.350
It gets worse.

45:59.411 --> 46:00.982
One of his goons called the station today

46:00.984 --> 46:03.021
talkin' reckless.

46:03.023 --> 46:04.870
You know this is serious.

46:04.872 --> 46:06.450
I think you need to call the Po Po.

46:06.452 --> 46:07.283
Call the Po Po.

46:07.285 --> 46:08.116
For real.

46:08.118 --> 46:08.949
Nah.

46:08.951 --> 46:09.782
Nah, it's cool.

46:09.784 --> 46:10.865
No, it's not cool.

46:10.867 --> 46:12.698
You're a public figure.

46:12.700 --> 46:14.284
And you're verified on the 'gram.

46:14.286 --> 46:15.571
The 'gram.

46:15.573 --> 46:17.426
And you know everybody.

46:17.428 --> 46:19.134
You know, anything could happen.

46:19.136 --> 46:20.560
Seriously.

46:20.562 --> 46:21.501
That's crazy, man.

46:21.503 --> 46:23.003
So you're telling me
that all this happened

46:23.005 --> 46:25.577
because she called the
station and you told her

46:25.579 --> 46:27.352
to get rid of old boy?

46:27.354 --> 46:29.608
You know what, man?

46:29.610 --> 46:32.494
I think you need to protect yourself.

46:32.496 --> 46:33.595
What you mean?

46:33.597 --> 46:34.992
What do you mean what do you mean?

46:34.994 --> 46:36.336
I think you should start packin'.

46:36.338 --> 46:37.767
Pew pew, nigga.

46:37.769 --> 46:39.350
Nah.

46:39.352 --> 46:40.683
It's not like that.

46:40.685 --> 46:41.774
It's Hendricks.

46:41.776 --> 46:43.879
It's like that, bro.

46:43.881 --> 46:46.601
For once, I agree with him.

46:46.603 --> 46:47.915
What you talkin'
about you agree with me?

46:50.264 --> 46:53.383
Like a mermaid or some shit.

46:53.385 --> 46:55.898
I don't damn know, but
just look at the booty.

46:55.900 --> 46:56.733
The booty.

47:05.009 --> 47:07.602
Now what you gonna do?

47:07.604 --> 47:09.424
Come on, I ain't got beef with y'all.

47:09.426 --> 47:10.539
Wrong.

47:10.541 --> 47:12.352
My mans, Hendricks, wanna see you.

47:12.354 --> 47:13.718
About what?

47:13.720 --> 47:14.930
About what?

47:14.932 --> 47:15.791
Listen to him.

47:15.793 --> 47:16.712
Sound like a little bitch.

47:16.714 --> 47:17.545
Little bitch.

47:17.547 --> 47:18.429
Hey ladies.

47:18.431 --> 47:19.506
Oh my God, that's Tony Sinclair.

47:20.610 --> 47:21.566
Yeah.

47:21.568 --> 47:22.483
Can we get a picture?

47:22.485 --> 47:23.934
Yeah, let's do it for the 'gram.

47:37.553 --> 47:38.386
Man.

47:42.884 --> 47:43.715
Hello?

47:43.717 --> 47:44.548
Hi, Tony.

47:44.550 --> 47:45.381
You busy?

47:45.383 --> 47:47.325
Ah, yeah, just a little bit.

47:47.327 --> 47:49.090
Oh, you sound out of breath.

47:49.092 --> 47:51.582
Yeah, well, you know,
two of Hendricks's goons

47:51.584 --> 47:53.183
just tried to kill me.

47:53.185 --> 47:54.164
Other than that, I'm fine.

47:54.166 --> 47:54.997
Just great.

47:54.999 --> 47:55.830
Just great.

47:55.832 --> 47:57.179
Oh my gosh, are you okay?

47:57.181 --> 47:58.467
Hell nah.

47:58.469 --> 48:00.886
Tony, I'm so sorry.

48:01.738 --> 48:05.203
Robin, dealin' with you
has put my life in jeopardy.

48:06.618 --> 48:08.785
I wanna see you.

48:09.847 --> 48:11.685
Robin, I'm done with this situation.

48:11.687 --> 48:14.520
I wanna make this right.

48:15.688 --> 48:16.519
You know what?

48:16.521 --> 48:18.451
I just need to clear my mind

48:18.453 --> 48:19.959
and I'm gonna go meet up with my boys.

48:19.961 --> 48:20.984
If that's okay with you.

48:20.986 --> 48:21.817
Okay.

48:21.819 --> 48:22.650
Well, yeah.

48:22.652 --> 48:24.868
Go on and do your thing.

48:24.870 --> 48:26.907
Yeah, I'll call you later.

48:26.909 --> 48:28.508
Be careful.

48:28.510 --> 48:29.341
Bye.

48:29.343 --> 48:30.174
Yeah, bye.

48:30.176 --> 48:31.009
Thanks.

48:32.884 --> 48:33.717
This is.

48:35.355 --> 48:36.522
This is crazy.

48:41.270 --> 48:42.353
Mm, mm, mm.

48:43.712 --> 48:45.212
You smell so good.

48:46.797 --> 48:48.714
And you look good, too.

48:49.900 --> 48:51.864
Thanks, Sadie.

48:51.866 --> 48:52.699
Ah, hey.

48:54.015 --> 48:57.227
You wanna have a glass of
wine before you head out?

48:57.229 --> 49:00.229
I'd love to, but I'm runnin' late.

49:02.675 --> 49:03.782
Well go on.

49:04.617 --> 49:05.897
With your bad ass.

49:05.899 --> 49:07.712
Don't hurt nobody.

49:10.187 --> 49:11.104
Bye, Sadie.

49:14.893 --> 49:16.454
♪ It's your birthday ♪

49:16.456 --> 49:18.082
♪ It's an earthquake ♪

49:18.084 --> 49:21.993
♪ It's your birthday ♪

49:21.995 --> 49:23.627
Whoa, look at that ass, boy.

49:23.629 --> 49:26.211
Workin' with a monster over there.

49:26.213 --> 49:27.604
Yes, you can.

49:27.606 --> 49:30.411
We're gonna be loch ness
monsters together, girl,

49:30.413 --> 49:31.246
let's go.

49:34.496 --> 49:35.329
Jesus.

49:36.178 --> 49:38.205
She about to take off.

49:38.207 --> 49:40.442
Lookin' like a cinnamon swirl.

49:40.444 --> 49:41.285
Look at you.

49:42.596 --> 49:43.946
Sup?

49:43.948 --> 49:45.187
What's up, man?

49:45.189 --> 49:47.974
Boy, you made it just
in time, my brother.

49:47.976 --> 49:51.205
Have a seat, have a seat, man.

49:57.837 --> 49:59.684
Yo, why you sittin' in
the corner with your back

49:59.686 --> 50:00.642
against the wall?

50:00.644 --> 50:01.659
This air lickin'.

50:03.550 --> 50:05.360
Yo, T, what's goin on, dog?

50:05.362 --> 50:06.889
You don't look too good.

50:06.891 --> 50:08.119
Oh, I don't feel too good.

50:08.121 --> 50:09.371
What's wrong?

50:10.396 --> 50:11.630
Them boys are still on my nuts?

50:11.632 --> 50:12.463
Who, Hendricks?

50:12.465 --> 50:13.311
Is he here?

50:13.313 --> 50:14.160
Come on, man.

50:14.162 --> 50:14.993
Ouch.

50:14.995 --> 50:16.823
You got one more time to be loud.

50:16.825 --> 50:17.656
Damn.

50:17.658 --> 50:18.614
What's you gonna do?

50:18.616 --> 50:19.447
I'll knock your ass off that seat.

50:19.449 --> 50:20.280
What's up?

50:20.282 --> 50:21.395
Just sayin', man.

50:21.397 --> 50:23.867
You need to call the
police like I told you to.

50:23.869 --> 50:25.011
You're damn skippy.

50:25.013 --> 50:25.844
See?

50:25.846 --> 50:29.252
I gotta be right if
Darren actually agrees.

50:29.254 --> 50:32.136
Oh you just called
me stupid, didn't you?

50:32.138 --> 50:33.228
I'm just sayin'.

50:33.230 --> 50:34.648
You need to get yourself some security.

50:34.650 --> 50:36.003
Or a trap or somethin', man.

50:36.005 --> 50:36.836
Yeah.

50:36.838 --> 50:37.862
You're too important
to be walkin' around here

50:37.864 --> 50:39.218
like somethin' happened to your dog, man.

50:39.220 --> 50:40.715
For real.

50:40.717 --> 50:41.658
You know what?

50:41.660 --> 50:42.491
Hey.

50:42.493 --> 50:44.146
Come here, you.

50:44.148 --> 50:46.080
Bring your little self over here.

50:46.082 --> 50:47.628
This will make you feel better, guy.

50:47.630 --> 50:49.986
Go ahead and do your thing.

50:49.988 --> 50:51.155
Do your thang.

50:52.400 --> 50:54.436
Yeah, you like that, don't you?

50:54.438 --> 50:56.107
Yeah.

50:56.109 --> 50:57.378
You like that don't ya?

50:57.380 --> 50:58.211
Yeah, it's nice.

50:58.213 --> 50:59.044
Look at that ass.

50:59.046 --> 51:00.751
Jigglin' like a mother.

51:00.753 --> 51:01.712
Go ahead.

51:01.714 --> 51:02.552
Go ahead.

51:02.554 --> 51:03.387
Go ahead.

51:05.249 --> 51:06.080
Smell it.

51:06.082 --> 51:06.913
Smell it.

51:08.496 --> 51:10.830
Oh, you banged before you came in.

51:10.832 --> 51:12.403
Yes you did.

51:12.405 --> 51:14.077
What kind of love are you?

51:14.079 --> 51:15.846
What kind of love are you?

51:15.848 --> 51:16.883
What kind of love you using?

51:18.586 --> 51:19.417
What are you doin', man?

51:19.419 --> 51:20.554
Get your dumb ass off.

51:20.556 --> 51:21.972
You're in this club to get some ass.

51:21.974 --> 51:23.057
You trippin'.

51:24.163 --> 51:24.994
It's a dollar.

51:24.996 --> 51:26.262
I was gettin' a dollar.

51:26.264 --> 51:28.381
Give me that damn dollar, man.

51:28.383 --> 51:29.214
I'm sorry.

51:29.216 --> 51:30.047
He's retarded.

51:30.049 --> 51:30.880
Didn't take his medicine.

51:30.882 --> 51:31.713
Gonna eat some booty today, boy.

51:31.715 --> 51:32.546
Woo.

51:41.946 --> 51:44.902
I take it you were in the area.

51:44.904 --> 51:45.826
Tony.

51:45.828 --> 51:46.911
Are you okay?

51:48.993 --> 51:50.616
Yeah.

51:50.618 --> 51:53.396
I know I forgot to hit
you back, but I've had

51:53.398 --> 51:54.921
a lot on my mind.

51:54.923 --> 51:56.421
Tony.

51:56.423 --> 52:00.673
I am so sorry about the
way things have been going.

52:01.646 --> 52:02.479
Baby.

52:04.249 --> 52:05.082
Baby.

52:09.192 --> 52:14.025
Why won't you let me help you
relieve some of this stress?

52:17.852 --> 52:20.019
After the week I've had,

52:21.991 --> 52:25.241
I'm one hundred percent down with that.

53:31.543 --> 53:33.043
This is so nice.

53:35.777 --> 53:36.939
Yes.

53:36.941 --> 53:37.858
Yes, it is.

53:40.015 --> 53:42.983
I can't believe we're like this.

53:42.985 --> 53:44.560
Can you?

53:44.562 --> 53:46.145
What do you mean?

53:47.682 --> 53:50.599
Why did you wanna go out with me?

53:51.451 --> 53:52.284
Hm.

53:53.388 --> 53:54.582
Your booty.

53:56.411 --> 53:58.411
No, I'm being serious.

54:02.299 --> 54:03.388
Besides the fact that you're

54:03.390 --> 54:06.667
the most gorgeous woman I've ever seen?

54:10.573 --> 54:14.788
I just feel like the
universe brought us together.

54:14.790 --> 54:16.040
It's like fate.

54:18.184 --> 54:20.176
What made you pick me?

54:20.178 --> 54:21.763
Are you kidding me?

54:21.765 --> 54:26.036
What woman wouldn't wanna go out with you?

54:26.038 --> 54:27.371
You're so sweet.

54:28.336 --> 54:29.292
Yeah, right.

54:29.294 --> 54:31.153
No, I mean it.

54:31.155 --> 54:34.322
I knew the first time I talked to you.

54:35.485 --> 54:37.808
Do we have to talk about that?

54:37.810 --> 54:40.042
Still a sore spot?

54:40.044 --> 54:43.142
Yeah, a little bit.

54:43.144 --> 54:45.644
I was going through so much.

54:47.047 --> 54:49.214
You mean with Hendricks?

54:50.514 --> 54:53.659
What made you get with a dude like that?

54:53.661 --> 54:56.153
You got down on this food.

54:56.155 --> 55:00.905
He was so laid-back and sweet
when we first got together.

55:02.279 --> 55:03.861
Oh.

55:03.863 --> 55:05.882
To wash the palette.

55:05.884 --> 55:06.715
Okay.

55:06.717 --> 55:08.235
I like fruit.

55:08.237 --> 55:09.497
You're beautiful.

55:09.499 --> 55:11.254
Thank you.

55:13.123 --> 55:15.400
I'm not normally shy, but
there's somethin' about you

55:15.402 --> 55:16.569
that has me...

55:17.702 --> 55:20.209
Just, I don't know what to
say when I'm around you.

55:20.211 --> 55:24.885
And then when I
moved in, everything changed.

55:24.887 --> 55:27.137
He just got so controlling.

55:28.790 --> 55:30.507
I mean, I couldn't even go to the bathroom

55:30.509 --> 55:33.162
without him wanting to know where I was

55:33.164 --> 55:34.914
and what I was doing.

55:36.779 --> 55:39.852
I couldn't even drive
myself to work anymore.

55:39.854 --> 55:42.248
He'd drop me off and pick me up.

55:42.250 --> 55:43.750
Are you serious?

55:48.502 --> 55:52.129
And then he started
putting his hands on me.

55:52.131 --> 55:53.355
What?

55:53.357 --> 55:54.420
You think this is a fucking game?

55:56.092 --> 55:59.308
He was pinning me down
and grabbing me mostly.

55:59.310 --> 56:00.560
He used to say,

56:02.377 --> 56:04.313
"It doesn't make any
sense to bruise up a peach

56:04.315 --> 56:06.315
and then try to eat it."

56:10.879 --> 56:13.753
You deserve so much better.

56:13.755 --> 56:14.687
Yeah, I know.

56:14.689 --> 56:15.522
I know.

56:17.836 --> 56:19.467
But that's what I was
going through the night

56:19.469 --> 56:22.552
that I called into the radio station.

56:25.767 --> 56:28.934
That night I got the courage to leave.

56:31.696 --> 56:36.370
And ever since that night,
I've really been able to

56:36.372 --> 56:37.872
just live my life.

56:38.932 --> 56:40.099
Enjoy my life.

56:45.439 --> 56:48.189
I feel so safe when I'm with you.

56:50.649 --> 56:53.399
Love should make you feel safe.

56:54.327 --> 56:58.779
If you feel that way, then
maybe it's time to move on.

57:01.059 --> 57:03.140
Christine, what are you doin' here?

57:03.142 --> 57:04.875
Well, hello to you, too.

57:04.877 --> 57:06.658
Darren told me about your new place,

57:06.660 --> 57:09.026
so I figured I'd stop by.

57:09.028 --> 57:10.846
I just came here to get my dog.

57:10.848 --> 57:13.597
I know my Princess misses me.

57:15.089 --> 57:17.672
I guess it's about that time.

57:21.613 --> 57:22.747
Oh.

57:22.749 --> 57:23.832
This is nice.

57:24.752 --> 57:28.192
I guess our breakup really paid off.

57:28.194 --> 57:30.689
And I see you haven't
changed a bit, Christine.

57:31.557 --> 57:33.140
Neither have you.

57:34.013 --> 57:35.678
Princess.

57:35.680 --> 57:36.862
Princess.

57:38.748 --> 57:39.927
Princess.

57:41.430 --> 57:43.085
So, am I interrupting something?

57:43.087 --> 57:45.337
Actually, you are.

57:55.908 --> 57:56.741
Mm.

58:01.275 --> 58:03.194
Damn, you been workin' out?

58:03.196 --> 58:04.446
A little bit.

58:06.992 --> 58:09.106
I can tell.

58:09.108 --> 58:10.525
Oh yeah?

58:12.378 --> 58:13.211
Yeah.

58:19.564 --> 58:21.484
Christine, what are you doin'?

58:21.486 --> 58:23.236
I missed you, baby.

58:25.990 --> 58:27.299
Hey, ba-

58:27.301 --> 58:29.114
What the fuck?

58:29.116 --> 58:29.968
Robin, for real.

58:29.970 --> 58:30.914
It's not what you think.

58:30.916 --> 58:32.768
Is this the girl from the restaurant?

58:32.770 --> 58:33.677
Yeah, that's right.

58:33.679 --> 58:35.480
I'm his lady.

58:35.482 --> 58:36.438
Oh really?

58:36.440 --> 58:37.504
No.

58:37.506 --> 58:38.825
That's my ex.

58:38.827 --> 58:39.658
Christine.

58:40.998 --> 58:42.052
Christine.

58:42.054 --> 58:44.008
The girl that dumped
you on the air the night

58:44.010 --> 58:46.689
that I called into the radio station?

58:46.691 --> 58:48.582
You have got to be kidding me.

58:48.584 --> 58:49.415
For re-

58:49.417 --> 58:50.927
- Wait, wait, wait.

58:50.929 --> 58:52.601
That was you?

58:52.603 --> 58:53.921
Oh.

58:53.923 --> 58:54.756
Come on.

58:55.712 --> 58:56.710
Look, look.

58:56.712 --> 58:57.635
Robin.

58:57.637 --> 58:58.955
You've gotta let me explain.

58:58.957 --> 59:01.383
No, it seems like you've
done enough explaingin.

59:03.139 --> 59:04.276
Robin.

59:04.278 --> 59:05.945
Don't worry, baby.

59:06.914 --> 59:07.745
It's gonna be okay.

59:07.747 --> 59:08.578
You need to go.

59:10.074 --> 59:10.978
Wait

59:10.980 --> 59:11.811
Baby.

59:12.646 --> 59:13.479
Robin.

59:15.098 --> 59:15.931
Robin.

59:21.747 --> 59:22.578
Robin.

59:22.580 --> 59:23.413
Robin.

59:26.470 --> 59:27.887
Mm.

59:32.992 --> 59:34.073
Go.

59:34.075 --> 59:34.908
Home.

59:37.634 --> 59:39.217
Tony.

59:48.946 --> 59:50.779
What's up, stranger.

59:56.456 --> 59:57.489
Come inside.

59:57.491 --> 59:58.324
Jesus.

59:59.336 --> 01:00:00.917
Next thing you know, Christine shows up

01:00:00.919 --> 01:00:03.499
because bigmouth Darren
gave her my address.

01:00:03.501 --> 01:00:04.593
Next thing you know,
she's kissin' all over me,

01:00:04.595 --> 01:00:05.426
talkin' about,

01:00:05.428 --> 01:00:06.259
"Oh I miss you."

01:00:06.261 --> 01:00:08.595
And Robin walks in and
all Hell breaks loose.

01:00:08.597 --> 01:00:09.557
You know what?

01:00:09.559 --> 01:00:12.809
Tony, baby, you have got to just relax.

01:00:13.991 --> 01:00:15.084
Now, look.

01:00:15.086 --> 01:00:18.276
You need to take some
quality time by yourself

01:00:18.278 --> 01:00:20.356
to think things through.

01:00:20.358 --> 01:00:24.093
And the main thing is,
you've got to give it to God.

01:00:24.095 --> 01:00:25.012
Pray on it.

01:00:26.729 --> 01:00:28.532
Trust me, it works.

01:00:28.534 --> 01:00:29.940
That's what I need to do?

01:00:29.942 --> 01:00:31.192
You heard me.

01:00:33.242 --> 01:00:35.454
God has never failed me, yet.

01:00:39.415 --> 01:00:40.248
Mm.

01:00:43.212 --> 01:00:44.045
Love.

01:00:46.293 --> 01:00:48.043
It's a powerful drug.

01:00:51.837 --> 01:00:52.668
Get.

01:00:52.670 --> 01:00:53.501
Get.

01:00:53.503 --> 01:00:54.334
Get out.

01:00:54.336 --> 01:00:55.167
Get out.

01:00:55.169 --> 01:00:56.447
Get your behind out.

01:00:56.449 --> 01:00:57.280
Now.

01:00:57.282 --> 01:00:58.532
Thanks, Sade.

01:00:59.596 --> 01:01:01.067
I mean Sadie.

01:01:01.069 --> 01:01:03.082
Boy, you heard me.

01:01:03.084 --> 01:01:04.623
Get to steppin'.

01:01:04.625 --> 01:01:06.250
I'll see you in the stairwell.

01:01:06.252 --> 01:01:08.664
Bye.

01:01:09.624 --> 01:01:11.569
Thank you, Jesus.

01:01:11.571 --> 01:01:12.404
Mm.

01:01:15.359 --> 01:01:16.192
Was close.

01:01:17.887 --> 01:01:22.603
You have reached
the voicemail box of...

01:01:53.815 --> 01:01:54.690
Robin?

01:01:54.692 --> 01:01:56.113
Listen, here you little
rice and bean eatin'.

01:01:56.115 --> 01:01:57.750
You little niglet.

01:01:57.752 --> 01:02:00.362
We have some unfinished
business that we neeed to handle

01:02:00.364 --> 01:02:01.447
face-to-face.

01:02:02.762 --> 01:02:04.378
Yo, who the hell do you
thnik you are tellin' my girl

01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:05.842
to leave me?

01:02:05.844 --> 01:02:07.662
Don't nobody leave Hendricks.

01:02:07.664 --> 01:02:08.495
Yo, look.

01:02:08.497 --> 01:02:09.328
Look, man.

01:02:09.330 --> 01:02:10.985
I don't want any trouble.

01:02:10.987 --> 01:02:12.687
I don't care what you want.

01:02:12.689 --> 01:02:15.759
Meet me at Wilson's Brothers
Lumberyard on Baycat

01:02:15.761 --> 01:02:16.594
in a hour.

01:02:17.609 --> 01:02:19.680
And you better be by yourself.

01:02:19.682 --> 01:02:22.689
Or the next time you see
this pretty little face,

01:02:22.691 --> 01:02:25.259
it's gonna be in some dog food.

01:02:25.261 --> 01:02:26.860
You understand me?

01:02:26.862 --> 01:02:29.073
Yeah, man, I understand.

01:02:35.874 --> 01:02:36.707
Shit.

01:03:04.489 --> 01:03:06.130
How's your nuts?

01:03:06.132 --> 01:03:07.443
It wasn't my nuts.

01:03:07.445 --> 01:03:08.644
It was his nuts.

01:03:08.646 --> 01:03:10.436
It looked like the same nuts to me.

01:03:10.438 --> 01:03:12.205
Think you'll be able
to shoot both of us?

01:03:12.207 --> 01:03:14.231
Before one of us shoots you.

01:03:14.233 --> 01:03:15.554
You spin records.

01:03:15.556 --> 01:03:18.025
You don't know nothin'
about this gangster life.

01:03:18.027 --> 01:03:18.944
Oh, word?

01:03:22.371 --> 01:03:23.202
Oh, shit.

01:03:35.950 --> 01:03:36.783
Tony?

01:03:38.656 --> 01:03:40.671
Oh my God, Tony, what did they do?

01:03:40.673 --> 01:03:42.439
What did you do to him?

01:03:42.441 --> 01:03:44.000
Tony.

01:03:45.216 --> 01:03:47.543
It's not what you thought
about me and Christine.

01:03:47.545 --> 01:03:48.855
Shut your cornball ass up.

01:03:49.690 --> 01:03:50.521
No, stop.

01:03:50.523 --> 01:03:51.354
Tony.

01:03:51.356 --> 01:03:52.187
And I felt it.

01:03:52.189 --> 01:03:53.053
Stop it.

01:03:57.880 --> 01:03:59.713
Oh, that's so sweet.

01:04:01.617 --> 01:04:03.700
So sweet it's killin' me.

01:04:06.616 --> 01:04:08.699
But it's killin' you too.

01:04:10.515 --> 01:04:13.265
Because of you, my woman left me.

01:04:14.548 --> 01:04:16.298
I'm not your woman.

01:04:18.184 --> 01:04:20.948
You know what they say.

01:04:20.950 --> 01:04:23.948
Choke a bitch and she'll love you.

01:04:23.950 --> 01:04:28.135
Let that hoe breathe, that
bitch will wanna leave.

01:04:29.009 --> 01:04:30.123
I should have kept choking your ass.

01:04:30.125 --> 01:04:31.770
You wouldn't be so damn disrespectful.

01:04:31.772 --> 01:04:33.336
You're a real
tough guy, Hendricks.

01:04:33.338 --> 01:04:34.169
What you say?

01:04:34.171 --> 01:04:35.002
You talkin' to me?

01:04:35.004 --> 01:04:36.011
Huh?

01:04:36.013 --> 01:04:36.844
You judgin' me?

01:04:36.846 --> 01:04:37.677
Huh?

01:04:40.072 --> 01:04:41.248
I'll beat your ass, too.

01:04:41.250 --> 01:04:42.417
Up in my shit.

01:04:45.814 --> 01:04:49.897
I will blow your FM radio
talkin' mouth out the back

01:04:49.899 --> 01:04:50.766
of your neck.

01:04:50.768 --> 01:04:51.923
No, no, no.

01:04:51.925 --> 01:04:52.756
Baby, baby.

01:04:52.758 --> 01:04:53.589
Baby, baby.

01:04:53.591 --> 01:04:54.422
Baby.

01:04:54.424 --> 01:04:55.255
Baby.

01:04:55.257 --> 01:04:57.713
Please don't hurt him.

01:04:57.715 --> 01:04:59.352
Don't hurt him.

01:04:59.354 --> 01:05:00.185
All right.

01:05:00.187 --> 01:05:01.228
I'll let him live.

01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:02.455
But you better straighten up, you hear me?

01:05:02.457 --> 01:05:03.288
Yes.

01:05:03.290 --> 01:05:04.297
I love you, baby.

01:05:04.299 --> 01:05:05.780
And I wanna work this out.

01:05:05.782 --> 01:05:08.032
I will do anything for you.

01:05:11.622 --> 01:05:13.492
I'm gonna let you live.

01:05:13.494 --> 01:05:15.124
Because my girl begged for your life.

01:05:15.126 --> 01:05:16.954
I will never.

01:05:16.956 --> 01:05:19.373
I will never leave you again.

01:05:21.657 --> 01:05:23.276
Go get dressed.

01:05:23.278 --> 01:05:25.386
We'll go get some ice cream
or some Lemon Lockey wings,

01:05:25.388 --> 01:05:26.221
all right?

01:05:27.118 --> 01:05:28.763
Just you and me, baby.

01:05:28.765 --> 01:05:30.015
Like old times.

01:05:33.918 --> 01:05:34.835
Hurry up.

01:05:35.818 --> 01:05:36.651
Come on.

01:05:46.658 --> 01:05:47.489
Get rid of him.

01:05:47.491 --> 01:05:49.698
But make it look a suicide.

01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:50.533
Got it?

01:06:05.536 --> 01:06:06.948
Yeah.

01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:09.288
You spend a lot of time
with your personal life

01:06:09.290 --> 01:06:11.561
and not our business, Hendricks.

01:06:11.563 --> 01:06:12.828
Shit.

01:06:12.830 --> 01:06:13.663
Damn.

01:06:20.457 --> 01:06:21.538
Be cool.

01:06:21.540 --> 01:06:22.371
We gonna follow him.

01:06:22.373 --> 01:06:23.971
Get your big
ass hand out of my face.

01:06:23.973 --> 01:06:24.804
My bad.

01:06:24.806 --> 01:06:25.637
Hey.

01:06:25.639 --> 01:06:27.226
It ain't worth this no more.

01:06:27.228 --> 01:06:28.059
Aw, man.

01:06:28.061 --> 01:06:29.638
They got guns.

01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:30.968
We got guns, too.

01:06:30.970 --> 01:06:32.497
I forgot.

01:06:32.499 --> 01:06:33.744
Just shut up and drive.

01:06:33.746 --> 01:06:36.128
What, you wanna follow 'em now?

01:06:36.130 --> 01:06:38.420
Shit, let's follow 'em.

01:06:38.422 --> 01:06:40.730
I ain't got time for this
man that you're talkin' about.

01:06:40.732 --> 01:06:42.248
No, you work for me.

01:06:42.250 --> 01:06:43.496
So, you have time for
anything I have to say.

01:06:44.456 --> 01:06:46.789
Man, fuck you.

01:06:49.489 --> 01:06:50.437
Where's my money?

01:06:50.439 --> 01:06:52.060
Look, I got your fuckin' money.

01:06:58.198 --> 01:06:59.198
Very good.

01:07:04.114 --> 01:07:05.523
Want a good time dish?

01:07:09.898 --> 01:07:11.835
What we talkin' about?

01:07:11.837 --> 01:07:13.867
He said he got my money.

01:07:13.869 --> 01:07:15.702
And you believe him.

01:07:16.912 --> 01:07:20.488
Only thing a man has
in this world is his word

01:07:20.490 --> 01:07:22.323
and his book of deeds.

01:07:26.124 --> 01:07:27.469
Oh, come on, Mellow man.

01:07:27.471 --> 01:07:28.588
Come on, man.

01:07:28.590 --> 01:07:29.797
Nah, don't do that.

01:07:32.343 --> 01:07:33.929
What should I do that?

01:07:33.931 --> 01:07:34.968
You want another line?

01:07:34.970 --> 01:07:37.132
Look at this piece of nothin'.

01:07:37.134 --> 01:07:38.646
You saw somethin' that
didn't belong to you

01:07:38.648 --> 01:07:40.643
and you took it anyway.

01:07:40.645 --> 01:07:43.681
And now that goes into your book of deeds.

01:07:43.683 --> 01:07:45.034
No, I didn't take nothin'.

01:07:55.714 --> 01:07:57.524
Eye for an eye.

01:07:59.259 --> 01:08:01.009
Oh, he took my eye.

01:08:02.124 --> 01:08:03.463
You still got one left.

01:08:03.465 --> 01:08:04.988
You'll be all right.

01:08:11.990 --> 01:08:13.152
Yeah, that's them right there.

01:08:13.154 --> 01:08:14.364
Oh, that's them.

01:08:14.366 --> 01:08:16.247
Boy, I'm about to do
surgery with this one.

01:08:16.249 --> 01:08:17.098
Darren, get back here.

01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:17.930
What?

01:08:17.933 --> 01:08:18.763
What?

01:08:18.765 --> 01:08:19.596
What are you doin'?

01:08:19.599 --> 01:08:20.886
What are you doin'?

01:08:20.889 --> 01:08:21.720
I wanna go take care of
my business for my nigga.

01:08:21.723 --> 01:08:22.957
This ain't trainin' day.

01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:24.404
All right, Lanzo?

01:08:24.406 --> 01:08:25.236
So, be cool.

01:08:25.238 --> 01:08:26.082
All right I'm cool.

01:08:26.084 --> 01:08:26.913
- All right.
- I'm cool.

01:08:26.916 --> 01:08:28.432
Don't be in a rush to get out there

01:08:28.434 --> 01:08:29.265
and get your ass shot.

01:08:29.268 --> 01:08:30.099
I don't wanna get shot.

01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:30.932
- All right?
- Okay.

01:08:30.934 --> 01:08:31.765
- Now, look.
- What?

01:08:31.767 --> 01:08:33.285
I'm gonna go out here

01:08:33.287 --> 01:08:34.118
and then we're gonna
handle this, all right?

01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:34.950
All right, you go piss.

01:08:34.952 --> 01:08:36.444
You sit in the car and
I want you to wait for me.

01:08:36.446 --> 01:08:37.921
All right, I'm gonna wait for you.

01:08:37.923 --> 01:08:38.779
All right.

01:08:38.782 --> 01:08:39.613
Wait, wait.

01:08:39.616 --> 01:08:40.447
How long?

01:08:40.448 --> 01:08:41.886
I don't know.
Just give me five.

01:08:41.888 --> 01:08:42.718
Five what?

01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:43.551
Five, five, bro, what?

01:08:43.554 --> 01:08:44.385
Five minutes?

01:08:44.386 --> 01:08:45.216
Five seconds?

01:08:45.219 --> 01:08:46.285
Five milliseconds?

01:08:46.287 --> 01:08:47.118
Five, five-

01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:47.950
- Dam nit, I don't know.
- Ultrasec-

01:08:47.952 --> 01:08:48.783
- All right.

01:08:48.786 --> 01:08:50.117
Just whenever you feel the time is right.

01:08:50.118 --> 01:08:51.198
The time is right?

01:08:51.201 --> 01:08:52.115
- Yeah.
- The time is right.

01:08:52.117 --> 01:08:54.788
- Yeah.
- Time is right.

01:08:54.791 --> 01:08:55.625
Okay.

01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:16.408
Didn't I tell you to give me five?

01:09:16.410 --> 01:09:18.734
You ain't specify.

01:09:18.737 --> 01:09:19.740
Point the gun that way.

01:09:19.742 --> 01:09:21.042
Oh.

01:09:21.044 --> 01:09:21.877
Yeah.

01:09:22.725 --> 01:09:24.673
Pointin' the gun at you.

01:09:24.675 --> 01:09:26.176
Stay right there.

01:09:26.179 --> 01:09:28.560
That's the third damn time.

01:09:28.562 --> 01:09:29.520
Tony, you all right?

01:09:29.523 --> 01:09:30.357
You good?

01:09:31.407 --> 01:09:34.104
Boy, somebody fucked you up.

01:09:34.106 --> 01:09:34.939
Boy, damn.

01:09:43.077 --> 01:09:43.938
No, no, no.

01:09:43.939 --> 01:09:45.796
I don't wanna get too fucked up.

01:09:45.798 --> 01:09:47.663
Got a flight to catch in four hours.

01:09:47.666 --> 01:09:50.578
Go upstairs and pack your shit, baby.

01:09:50.581 --> 01:09:52.451
I'm not going anywhere with you.

01:09:52.453 --> 01:09:53.703
Yes, you are.

01:09:57.409 --> 01:09:58.240
What's up?

01:10:09.124 --> 01:10:10.282
I'll follow them.

01:10:10.284 --> 01:10:11.890
You guys go get the police.

01:10:11.892 --> 01:10:12.725
What?

01:10:13.781 --> 01:10:15.534
Yeah, you heard what I said.

01:10:15.536 --> 01:10:16.369
Go.

01:10:20.964 --> 01:10:22.600
We're his kid niggas, bro.

01:10:22.602 --> 01:10:23.830
Let me out of this car.

01:10:23.832 --> 01:10:24.663
I don't-

01:10:24.665 --> 01:10:26.333
Stop this car.

01:10:26.335 --> 01:10:27.318
Let me out.

01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:29.342
I don't wanna go with you nowhere.

01:10:29.344 --> 01:10:30.869
You're never gonna leave me.

01:10:30.871 --> 01:10:32.126
I said I'm not goin' with you nowhere.

01:10:32.128 --> 01:10:33.446
I wanna get out of this car.

01:10:33.448 --> 01:10:36.068
Robin, you love me, right?

01:10:36.070 --> 01:10:37.101
I don't love you.

01:10:37.103 --> 01:10:38.242
I don't wanna be with you.

01:10:38.244 --> 01:10:39.075
Wow.

01:10:39.077 --> 01:10:40.365
I told you that.

01:10:40.367 --> 01:10:41.608
Let me out of this car, please.

01:10:41.610 --> 01:10:42.441
All right, I got somethin' for you.

01:10:42.443 --> 01:10:43.399
Please.

01:10:43.401 --> 01:10:45.812
Shut up, I'm on the phone.

01:10:45.814 --> 01:10:48.050
Yo, how y'all bring them
clowns up in my house?

01:10:48.052 --> 01:10:51.043
Man, Hendricks, they
got the drop on us, man.

01:10:51.045 --> 01:10:52.376
Really?

01:10:52.378 --> 01:10:53.208
Look, man.

01:10:53.210 --> 01:10:54.331
You guys got the product?

01:10:54.333 --> 01:10:55.164
We got it all.

01:10:55.166 --> 01:10:56.124
We got it all.

01:10:56.126 --> 01:10:57.712
All right, nevermind that other stuff.

01:10:57.714 --> 01:10:59.980
We've got a flight to catch.

01:10:59.982 --> 01:11:01.946
And I got Robin.

01:11:01.948 --> 01:11:03.714
I said let me out of this car.

01:11:03.716 --> 01:11:04.547
All right, peace.

01:11:04.549 --> 01:11:05.380
Please.

01:11:05.382 --> 01:11:06.213
- Jump out.
- Please.

01:11:06.215 --> 01:11:07.083
Get out, then.

01:11:07.085 --> 01:11:07.989
- Please.
- Get out.

01:11:07.991 --> 01:11:08.822
I'll get out this damn thing.

01:11:08.824 --> 01:11:09.655
Well, go ahead. Go ahead.

01:11:09.657 --> 01:11:10.840
- Hurt yourself.
- Unlock the door.

01:11:10.842 --> 01:11:11.717
Let me out.

01:11:14.807 --> 01:11:16.458
After everything I done for you.

01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:17.851
I always treat you good

01:11:17.853 --> 01:11:20.144
I've always been there for you.

01:11:20.146 --> 01:11:22.985
Is this how you treat me?

01:11:22.987 --> 01:11:23.823
Please.

01:11:23.825 --> 01:11:24.917
You said forever.

01:11:24.919 --> 01:11:26.583
Please, let me out.

01:11:26.585 --> 01:11:28.446
You said forever.

01:11:28.448 --> 01:11:30.441
I don't care about anything
else in this world,

01:11:30.443 --> 01:11:32.837
but you and my money.

01:11:32.839 --> 01:11:35.109
You know how much I love my money.

01:11:35.111 --> 01:11:36.943
You should be honored.

01:12:00.193 --> 01:12:02.489
Y'all ready to be some millionaires?

01:12:02.491 --> 01:12:06.991
You already know.

01:12:20.023 --> 01:12:23.060
So, you're tellin' me
you got a hundred pounds

01:12:23.062 --> 01:12:26.478
of yaya and five hundred pounds of hydro?

01:12:27.799 --> 01:12:31.132
We stand to make 10, 15 million dollars.

01:12:34.483 --> 01:12:37.316
Hell, we could buy our own island.

01:12:38.315 --> 01:12:39.148
What?

01:12:41.636 --> 01:12:44.387
You got somethin' you wanna say?

01:12:49.255 --> 01:12:50.922
What you lookin' at?

01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:54.769
Nothin'.

01:12:54.771 --> 01:12:59.079
Shoulda killed your ass a long time ago.

01:12:59.081 --> 01:13:01.248
'Cause you're a liability.

01:13:02.434 --> 01:13:06.649
I can't be out here in the
streets lackin' over no broad.

01:13:06.651 --> 01:13:08.818
You coulda had everything.

01:13:10.148 --> 01:13:11.066
The houses.

01:13:12.277 --> 01:13:13.110
The cars.

01:13:14.587 --> 01:13:15.587
The jewelry.

01:13:17.670 --> 01:13:18.503
The money.

01:13:21.084 --> 01:13:23.642
But you threw it all away because.

01:13:23.644 --> 01:13:26.571
Because some dumbass DJ told you to.

01:13:26.573 --> 01:13:29.345
And, on top of all that,
his girlfriend called in

01:13:29.347 --> 01:13:30.930
after you.

01:13:30.932 --> 01:13:33.327
And broke up with his punk ass on the air.

01:13:36.128 --> 01:13:37.878
You leave me for him?

01:13:42.084 --> 01:13:45.241
Hurry and wrap that shit up.

01:13:45.243 --> 01:13:47.160
We to a plane to catch.

01:13:52.032 --> 01:13:53.032
I loved you.

01:13:56.264 --> 01:13:57.682
I still love you.

01:14:02.209 --> 01:14:04.437
But you a dumb bitch.

01:14:04.439 --> 01:14:05.419
But you're my dumb bitch.

01:14:08.121 --> 01:14:09.871
You call this love?

01:14:13.058 --> 01:14:14.663
Sometimes love hurts, bitch.

01:14:14.665 --> 01:14:16.082
Hold up.

01:14:17.217 --> 01:14:19.880
Look who it, Captain Save A Hoe, huh?

01:14:19.882 --> 01:14:22.080
Whose a dumb bitch now?

01:14:22.082 --> 01:14:22.917
Drop it.

01:14:22.919 --> 01:14:23.752
Right now.

01:14:24.930 --> 01:14:26.847
Ain't no safety on now.

01:14:29.550 --> 01:14:31.143
They're comin'.

01:14:31.145 --> 01:14:31.978
You okay?

01:14:34.001 --> 01:14:36.132
Robin, I'm so sorry.

01:14:36.134 --> 01:14:38.337
Me too.

01:14:38.339 --> 01:14:39.685
I should have told you
about Christine that day

01:14:39.687 --> 01:14:41.187
at the restaurant.

01:14:42.639 --> 01:14:44.639
She means nothin' to me.

01:14:45.474 --> 01:14:46.557
She's my past.

01:14:48.591 --> 01:14:50.930
Oh, so I'm a part of your past, huh?

01:15:01.614 --> 01:15:03.031
Good job, baby.

01:15:04.459 --> 01:15:07.742
The worst thing you could ever do

01:15:07.744 --> 01:15:10.744
is think somebody's dumber than you.

01:15:12.052 --> 01:15:14.607
You up in the bar and grill
tryin' to put the move

01:15:14.609 --> 01:15:15.526
on my girl.

01:15:16.912 --> 01:15:18.162
And guess what?

01:15:19.044 --> 01:15:21.710
I did the same thing with yours.

01:15:22.852 --> 01:15:25.934
I knew that night you weren't shit.

01:15:26.822 --> 01:15:27.896
You forget.

01:15:27.898 --> 01:15:31.344
I stuck by you when you had nothing.

01:15:31.346 --> 01:15:32.179
Nothing.

01:15:33.485 --> 01:15:35.109
I paid your bills.

01:15:35.111 --> 01:15:37.193
I made sure rent was met.

01:15:39.665 --> 01:15:42.748
I was a damn good woman to you, baby.

01:15:44.326 --> 01:15:45.157
And what do you do?

01:15:45.159 --> 01:15:45.992
Work.

01:15:47.227 --> 01:15:48.894
I worked, Christine.

01:15:50.124 --> 01:15:53.092
How do you think I got
to where I am today?

01:15:53.094 --> 01:15:54.594
I put in the work.

01:15:56.684 --> 01:15:59.841
You couldn't wait for
a brother to come up.

01:15:59.843 --> 01:16:02.093
You were too self-absorbed.

01:16:04.545 --> 01:16:06.712
A good woman hangs around.

01:16:07.857 --> 01:16:11.773
She does what it takes
to help her man make it.

01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:14.870
It was all about you.

01:16:16.353 --> 01:16:18.603
What you did was heartless.

01:16:19.559 --> 01:16:22.309
There's no comin' back from that.

01:16:24.255 --> 01:16:27.346
You dumped me on my own show.

01:16:27.348 --> 01:16:28.681
Live on the air.

01:16:37.452 --> 01:16:38.283
Very touching.

01:16:38.285 --> 01:16:39.368
Almost cried.

01:16:41.199 --> 01:16:42.208
Going somewhere?

01:16:42.210 --> 01:16:43.954
Hey, Romelo.

01:16:43.956 --> 01:16:45.061
Your stuff is right here.

01:16:45.063 --> 01:16:46.788
I was just about to call you.

01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:47.789
I was born at night.

01:16:47.791 --> 01:16:49.261
But not last night.

01:16:49.263 --> 01:16:50.699
Police.

01:16:56.022 --> 01:16:57.420
Christine, don't.

01:16:57.422 --> 01:16:58.618
No.

01:16:58.620 --> 01:17:00.119
No.

01:17:00.121 --> 01:17:00.955
Christine.

01:17:24.850 --> 01:17:25.998
Oh, God, Darren.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Hey, baby.

01:17:28.633 --> 01:17:29.716
Is he okay?

01:17:31.335 --> 01:17:32.503
No, he just.

01:17:33.415 --> 01:17:35.196
He's not lookin' good.

01:17:35.198 --> 01:17:36.235
Can we go in?

01:17:36.237 --> 01:17:37.154
We can't.

01:17:38.100 --> 01:17:38.933
Sit down.

01:17:45.456 --> 01:17:46.541
How does he look?

01:17:46.543 --> 01:17:48.458
I need to be straight.

01:17:48.460 --> 01:17:50.570
He's in critical condition.

01:17:50.572 --> 01:17:54.687
And, he has a bullet lodged
very close to his heart,

01:17:54.689 --> 01:17:55.606
I'm afraid.

01:17:57.374 --> 01:17:59.207
What does that mean?

01:18:00.603 --> 01:18:03.282
It's too early
to say at this moment.

01:18:03.284 --> 01:18:06.201
It's more touch and go, I'm afraid.

01:18:07.802 --> 01:18:08.898
Yeah.

01:18:08.900 --> 01:18:09.733
I'm sorry.

01:18:24.514 --> 01:18:26.512
Love should make you feel safe.

01:18:26.514 --> 01:18:29.041
Can I speak to you in private?

01:18:29.043 --> 01:18:33.710
If you feel that way, then
maybe it's time to move on.

01:18:35.648 --> 01:18:38.622
I was about to take my
life that night I called in.

01:18:38.624 --> 01:18:40.342
Just hang in there, love.

01:18:40.344 --> 01:18:41.927
It'll be all right.

01:18:51.936 --> 01:18:54.018
It's all your fault, man.

01:18:54.020 --> 01:18:55.380
You knew you was mixed
up with that dope boy

01:18:55.382 --> 01:18:56.767
when you called into that station.

01:18:56.769 --> 01:18:58.445
You knew it when you brought
your ass over to that table

01:18:58.447 --> 01:18:59.771
in the club, man.

01:18:59.773 --> 01:19:00.604
Darren.

01:19:00.606 --> 01:19:02.214
We've been friends
since high school, man.

01:19:02.216 --> 01:19:03.412
We was little boys.

01:19:03.414 --> 01:19:05.081
It's not the time.

01:19:06.193 --> 01:19:07.193
I'm sorry.

01:19:12.682 --> 01:19:13.677
I'm sorry.

01:19:13.679 --> 01:19:14.510
You know what?

01:19:14.512 --> 01:19:15.342
I can't.

01:19:15.344 --> 01:19:16.178
I can't.

01:19:17.576 --> 01:19:18.532
I'm sorry.

01:19:18.534 --> 01:19:19.633
I'm sorry.

01:19:19.635 --> 01:19:21.610
What you gonna
fuck her and leave her?

01:19:21.612 --> 01:19:22.625
What's you mean?

01:19:22.627 --> 01:19:24.503
You're gonna put a ring on it.

01:19:24.505 --> 01:19:26.619
She dope, man.

01:19:26.621 --> 01:19:29.954
Oh my God.

01:20:33.002 --> 01:20:34.556
Come on, Mattie.

01:20:34.558 --> 01:20:35.526
Oh, touchdown.

01:20:35.528 --> 01:20:37.234
Let's go, boy.

01:20:37.236 --> 01:20:38.353
Woo!

01:20:38.355 --> 01:20:39.186
Hey guys.

01:20:39.188 --> 01:20:40.993
I know you guys are havin'
fun, but visitin' time

01:20:40.995 --> 01:20:44.745
is almost over, so, once
again, tone it down.

01:20:46.055 --> 01:20:47.135
Sorry.

01:20:47.137 --> 01:20:48.967
_ Yes, nurse Jackie.

01:20:55.466 --> 01:20:56.299
Shut up.

01:20:59.478 --> 01:21:03.676
Y'all don't keep down
that damn noise, man.

01:21:03.678 --> 01:21:04.694
Oh.

01:21:04.696 --> 01:21:06.446
What's goin' on, man?

01:21:09.335 --> 01:21:10.167
Jesus.

01:21:10.169 --> 01:21:11.170
Can't believe you're awake.

01:21:11.172 --> 01:21:12.675
Me either, man.

01:21:12.677 --> 01:21:14.687
All right, if you don't
quit all that damn cryin'

01:21:14.689 --> 01:21:17.039
and soundin' like a little bitch.

01:21:17.041 --> 01:21:19.123
Ever since I got here.

01:21:20.471 --> 01:21:23.819
I've been tryin' to wake
up just to slap your ass.

01:21:23.821 --> 01:21:24.652
Wasn't cryin'.

01:21:24.654 --> 01:21:25.987
He was cryin'.

01:21:26.941 --> 01:21:28.921
I could hear it all.

01:21:28.923 --> 01:21:30.090
Talkin' about,

01:21:31.088 --> 01:21:33.916
"We've been friends since high school."

01:21:33.918 --> 01:21:35.164
High school.

01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:39.411
Relax now.

01:21:39.413 --> 01:21:40.859
Man, it's good to see you awake.

01:21:40.861 --> 01:21:41.856
Man, how you feel?

01:21:41.858 --> 01:21:43.003
Yeah, man.

01:21:43.005 --> 01:21:45.020
Man, I'm alive.

01:21:45.022 --> 01:21:48.563
Wakin' up to you two knuckleheads.

01:21:48.565 --> 01:21:49.705
But God is good.

01:21:49.707 --> 01:21:51.971
Yeah He is, man.

01:21:51.973 --> 01:21:54.391
It's just so good to see you awake, man.

01:21:54.393 --> 01:21:56.018
Now, where you get off
scarin' Darren like that?

01:21:56.020 --> 01:21:56.963
No, I wasn't.

01:21:56.965 --> 01:21:57.796
I wasn't scared, man.

01:21:57.798 --> 01:21:59.537
Last night was crazy, okay?

01:21:59.539 --> 01:22:00.907
I wasn't scared.

01:22:00.909 --> 01:22:01.740
Yeah.

01:22:01.742 --> 01:22:02.573
Yeah.

01:22:02.575 --> 01:22:03.405
You were scared.

01:22:03.407 --> 01:22:04.239
You were scared.

01:22:04.241 --> 01:22:06.072
But, other than that,
I don't remember much.

01:22:06.074 --> 01:22:07.313
Wait, wait.

01:22:07.315 --> 01:22:08.894
You don't remember how
we had your boy held up,

01:22:08.896 --> 01:22:10.946
you know in the meat-packin' plant?

01:22:10.948 --> 01:22:11.779
Yeah.

01:22:11.781 --> 01:22:12.612
Remember that?

01:22:12.614 --> 01:22:14.803
You know, he used it for his stash spot.

01:22:14.805 --> 01:22:15.636
Right.

01:22:15.638 --> 01:22:16.524
You know,
Chris rolled up on you.

01:22:16.526 --> 01:22:17.394
You know, you find out
them two workin' together.

01:22:17.396 --> 01:22:19.455
You don't remember none of that?

01:22:19.457 --> 01:22:21.545
That's when everything became fuzzy.

01:22:21.547 --> 01:22:23.164
Yeah, well that's when you got shot.

01:22:23.166 --> 01:22:24.856
Yeah, Christine capped your ass, bro.

01:22:24.858 --> 01:22:26.429
Christine shot-

01:22:26.431 --> 01:22:28.170
Christine shot me?

01:22:28.172 --> 01:22:29.482
Police came in, "Freeze."

01:22:29.484 --> 01:22:32.233
You know, Hendricks disappeared and stuff.

01:22:32.235 --> 01:22:33.703
And Christine is in there
fightin' for her virginity

01:22:33.705 --> 01:22:35.057
in there right now.

01:22:35.059 --> 01:22:37.938
Man, I guess hurt people,
they just hurt people.

01:22:37.940 --> 01:22:40.359
Yeah, can't think about it.

01:22:40.361 --> 01:22:41.958
Yeah, she tried to shoot Robin.

01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:42.794
Yeah.

01:22:44.632 --> 01:22:45.965
Where's Robin?

01:22:47.987 --> 01:22:49.071
Oh, uh, we.

01:22:50.620 --> 01:22:51.630
Lot has changed, man.

01:22:51.632 --> 01:22:52.588
I don't know, she-

01:22:52.590 --> 01:22:53.458
- She bounced, man.

01:22:53.460 --> 01:22:54.292
Oh, uh.

01:22:54.294 --> 01:22:55.127
Maybe.

01:22:56.687 --> 01:23:00.206
I said some things I shouldn't
have and she, you know.

01:23:00.208 --> 01:23:02.474
All right, gentleman.

01:23:02.476 --> 01:23:04.682
I'm gonna have to have you leave.

01:23:04.684 --> 01:23:06.643
Tony's parents are here
and they'd like to spend

01:23:06.645 --> 01:23:07.733
a little time with him

01:23:07.735 --> 01:23:08.753
My bad, bro.

01:23:08.755 --> 01:23:10.439
See what you did, man?

01:23:10.441 --> 01:23:12.341
Thank you.

01:23:23.809 --> 01:23:25.166
Hey, son.

01:23:25.168 --> 01:23:26.551
You okay?

01:23:26.553 --> 01:23:28.122
Hi.

01:23:28.124 --> 01:23:29.691
Oh my baby.

01:24:15.978 --> 01:24:17.518
The number
you dialed has been changed,

01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:20.802
disconnected, or is no longer in service.

01:24:20.804 --> 01:24:23.384
If you feel you have reached
this recording in error,

01:24:23.386 --> 01:24:25.786
please check the number
and try your call again.

01:25:09.455 --> 01:25:11.296
I Salaam-Alaikum, my brother.

01:25:11.298 --> 01:25:14.071
Welcome to the religion of Islam.

01:25:14.073 --> 01:25:16.178
Islam means peace.

01:25:16.180 --> 01:25:18.550
And that's what we wished all the brothers

01:25:18.552 --> 01:25:21.301
and the sisters and all
the human beings on earth.

01:25:21.303 --> 01:25:22.329
Peace.

01:25:22.331 --> 01:25:23.686
As-salamu alaykum.

01:25:23.688 --> 01:25:25.551
Alaykum as-salam.

01:25:25.553 --> 01:25:26.384
Thank you.

01:25:26.386 --> 01:25:27.996
As-salaumu alaykum, my brother.

01:25:27.998 --> 01:25:29.234
Alaykum as-salamu.

01:25:29.236 --> 01:25:30.219
So good to see you.

01:25:30.221 --> 01:25:31.094
Wow, look at you.

01:25:31.929 --> 01:25:32.802
You look amazing.

01:25:32.804 --> 01:25:33.892
You too, my brother.

01:25:33.894 --> 01:25:35.389
Hey, you want the rest of my orange?

01:25:35.391 --> 01:25:36.347
Hey, this is my wife.

01:25:37.540 --> 01:25:38.371
How are you?

01:25:39.206 --> 01:25:40.037
Good to meet you.

01:25:40.039 --> 01:25:40.869
She's beautiful, ain't she?

01:25:40.871 --> 01:25:42.725
Yes, she is.

01:25:42.727 --> 01:25:44.109
Wow.

01:25:44.111 --> 01:25:46.003
Keep goin' okay.

01:25:47.218 --> 01:25:48.124
My brother.

01:25:48.126 --> 01:25:48.959
Let's go.

01:25:51.888 --> 01:25:52.721
Wow.

01:25:55.103 --> 01:25:55.978
You somebody, man.

01:25:55.980 --> 01:25:56.811
I can see it.

01:25:56.813 --> 01:25:58.039
Okay?

01:25:58.041 --> 01:26:00.291
Don't you ever forget that.

01:26:01.803 --> 01:26:02.636
Hey.

01:26:03.550 --> 01:26:06.278
And get your damn head up.

01:26:06.280 --> 01:26:08.485
BBX 105 Radio.

01:26:08.487 --> 01:26:11.818
You are live in the G Smooth Experience.

01:26:11.820 --> 01:26:13.848
And that was the brand
new record from my man,

01:26:13.850 --> 01:26:14.806
Malachi.

01:26:14.808 --> 01:26:16.014
Yo, Malachi.

01:26:16.016 --> 01:26:17.659
Thank you for comin' by
and droppin' that new music

01:26:17.661 --> 01:26:18.757
on us, man.

01:26:18.759 --> 01:26:20.494
You are welcome here anytime.

01:26:20.496 --> 01:26:21.327
Preciate you.

01:26:21.329 --> 01:26:22.253
'Ppreciate you havin' me too.

01:26:22.255 --> 01:26:23.087
Awesome.

01:26:23.089 --> 01:26:24.089
All right.

01:26:25.316 --> 01:26:27.066
All right, Atlanta.

01:26:28.501 --> 01:26:31.751
As you all know, my man, Tony Sinclair,

01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:36.427
who is a integral part
of the BBX 105 family

01:26:38.540 --> 01:26:41.234
was shot several months ago.

01:26:41.236 --> 01:26:44.390
And, you know, we almost lost him.

01:26:44.392 --> 01:26:45.548
But.

01:26:45.550 --> 01:26:50.178
I am happy to say that my
man is back in the buildin'.

01:26:50.180 --> 01:26:52.082
He's getting ready to take over.

01:26:52.084 --> 01:26:53.839
Gettin' ready for the return.

01:26:53.841 --> 01:26:54.672
Of my man.

01:26:54.674 --> 01:26:55.841
Tony Sinclair.

01:26:56.780 --> 01:26:58.213
It's all yours, man.

01:26:58.215 --> 01:26:59.473
You're the man, G Smooth.

01:26:59.475 --> 01:27:00.403
Let's get it.

01:27:02.485 --> 01:27:03.585
Wow.

01:27:03.587 --> 01:27:04.420
Right.

01:27:07.061 --> 01:27:10.573
Get nice and comfortable up in here.

01:27:23.974 --> 01:27:25.990
Hello, Atlanta.

01:27:25.992 --> 01:27:28.687
You're on the air with Tony Sinclair.

01:27:28.689 --> 01:27:32.071
And I just wanna say, from
the bottom of my heart,

01:27:32.073 --> 01:27:34.740
I humbly am so happy to be back.

01:27:36.091 --> 01:27:38.158
And I wanna hear from my callers.

01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:40.083
I wanna hear from my people.

01:27:40.085 --> 01:27:40.918
Atlanta.

01:27:42.312 --> 01:27:44.493
You're on the air with Tony Sinclair.

01:27:44.495 --> 01:27:45.517
What's on your mind?

01:27:45.519 --> 01:27:47.188
Hi, Tony.

01:27:47.190 --> 01:27:48.919
Hey, how you doin'?

01:27:48.921 --> 01:27:50.321
This is Carmen.

01:27:50.323 --> 01:27:52.092
I wanna let you know we missed you

01:27:52.094 --> 01:27:54.367
and so glad to have you back.

01:27:54.369 --> 01:27:57.126
It is so good to be back.

01:27:57.128 --> 01:27:58.210
What's goin' on, brother?

01:27:58.212 --> 01:27:59.222
It's DJ Taurus.

01:27:59.224 --> 01:28:00.055
Hey, brother.

01:28:00.057 --> 01:28:01.266
Good to hear from you.

01:28:01.268 --> 01:28:02.418
Man, we thought we lost you.

01:28:02.420 --> 01:28:03.251
Man.

01:28:03.253 --> 01:28:04.644
I'm glad we didn't lose you, brother.

01:28:04.646 --> 01:28:05.542
Welcome back.

01:28:05.544 --> 01:28:06.375
Thanks, brother.

01:28:06.377 --> 01:28:08.252
I appreciate that.

01:28:08.254 --> 01:28:09.335
Next caller.

01:28:09.337 --> 01:28:11.555
Hey, Tony, this is Marcus.

01:28:11.557 --> 01:28:12.694
Hey, Marcus.

01:28:12.696 --> 01:28:14.570
I just want
you to give a shout out

01:28:14.572 --> 01:28:17.413
to all my friends in town for
the black gay pride weekend.

01:28:17.415 --> 01:28:19.335
That's what's up.

01:28:19.337 --> 01:28:20.703
Next caller.

01:28:20.705 --> 01:28:22.305
Hi, Tony.

01:28:22.307 --> 01:28:25.253
I'm so glad you're feeling better.

01:28:25.255 --> 01:28:26.880
Oh, thank you, thank you.

01:28:26.882 --> 01:28:29.328
I wanna ask your advice.

01:28:29.330 --> 01:28:30.225
Go ahead.

01:28:30.227 --> 01:28:32.026
What should a woman
do when she's messed up

01:28:32.028 --> 01:28:34.780
getting to know the best
man she's ever known

01:28:34.782 --> 01:28:36.043
in her life?

01:28:36.045 --> 01:28:37.123
I don't know.

01:28:37.125 --> 01:28:38.021
What do you mean?

01:28:38.023 --> 01:28:41.025
I mean, what if she put
not only herself into danger,

01:28:41.027 --> 01:28:43.110
but, him and his friends?

01:28:50.344 --> 01:28:53.677
Why does your voice sound so familiar?

01:28:54.582 --> 01:28:55.664
It should.

01:28:55.666 --> 01:28:57.639
When I heard your voice on the radio,

01:28:57.641 --> 01:28:59.474
I just had to call in.

01:29:00.525 --> 01:29:02.485
Look, I was wrong for how I did things

01:29:02.487 --> 01:29:03.493
and what I did to you.

01:29:03.495 --> 01:29:05.730
I should have never got you
caught up in a situation

01:29:05.732 --> 01:29:06.563
like that.

01:29:06.565 --> 01:29:08.297
It could've cost you and
your friends your life.

01:29:08.299 --> 01:29:09.466
I am so sorry.

01:29:12.077 --> 01:29:14.450
I just want another chance.

01:29:14.452 --> 01:29:19.216
No one has ever treated me as
good as you treated me, Tony.

01:29:19.218 --> 01:29:21.200
I don't know.

01:29:21.202 --> 01:29:22.947
Tony, I'm sorry.

01:29:22.949 --> 01:29:23.782
I'm sorry.

01:29:30.723 --> 01:29:31.973
I don't know.

01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:35.112
I just don't know.

01:29:41.885 --> 01:29:44.802
If you can tell me no to my face,

01:29:45.721 --> 01:29:48.544
I will never bother you again.

01:29:48.546 --> 01:29:49.624
Go.

01:29:49.626 --> 01:29:50.459
Go.

01:30:02.422 --> 01:30:03.255
Robin.

01:30:29.416 --> 01:30:30.250
Oh.

01:30:33.777 --> 01:30:36.360
Oh.

01:30:38.639 --> 01:30:39.473
Uh.

01:30:41.480 --> 01:30:42.563
Hey, Atlanta.

01:30:45.464 --> 01:30:47.026
I don't know what to say.

01:30:49.728 --> 01:30:53.119
I was not expectin' a comeback like this.

01:30:53.121 --> 01:30:57.038
The woman that got this
all started a while ago

01:30:58.607 --> 01:31:01.523
and has my heart pumpin' every day,

01:31:02.779 --> 01:31:05.362
is here in the station with me.

01:31:06.742 --> 01:31:09.913
I just don't know what to say.

01:31:09.915 --> 01:31:11.748
Shut up and kiss me.

01:31:18.478 --> 01:31:20.362
Go get it, boy.

01:31:20.364 --> 01:31:23.614
I ain't about to sit your kids, though.

01:31:38.225 --> 01:31:40.732
Oo, this is gonna be good.

01:31:40.734 --> 01:31:42.151
What's up, pop?

01:31:43.156 --> 01:31:44.423
I didn't know you was here.

01:31:44.425 --> 01:31:45.425
What's up?

01:31:47.174 --> 01:31:49.757
Nigger, that's gonna be good.

01:31:51.081 --> 01:31:52.259
You happy, son?

01:31:52.261 --> 01:31:53.610
Yeah.

01:31:53.612 --> 01:31:54.966
I'm proud of you.

01:31:54.968 --> 01:31:56.135
Thanks, pop.

01:31:57.341 --> 01:31:59.860
I still need some gas money, though.

01:31:59.862 --> 01:32:00.976
You know what?

01:32:00.978 --> 01:32:01.812
I got you.

01:32:02.657 --> 01:32:03.732
Come on.

01:32:03.734 --> 01:32:04.567
What?

01:32:05.663 --> 01:32:07.615
Just come on.

01:32:07.617 --> 01:32:09.034
Watch my grill.

01:32:16.834 --> 01:32:18.166
Is food ready?

01:32:21.889 --> 01:32:22.889
Is it ready?

01:32:27.832 --> 01:32:29.023
That's not done yet.

01:32:29.025 --> 01:32:30.108
Try that one.

01:32:34.237 --> 01:32:35.237
All right.

01:32:47.302 --> 01:32:48.850
You did good, boy.
