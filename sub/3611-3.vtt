00:02.253 --> 00:03.459
Previously on Lost:

00:03.546 --> 00:06.162
Whatever Ben Linus did
down at the Orchid station...

00:06.257 --> 00:09.795
- ...it may have dislodged us.
- The island is moving through time?

00:09.886 --> 00:12.423
Either the island is, or we are.

00:15.766 --> 00:19.224
I need you to go back
to Oxford University.

00:19.312 --> 00:23.055
Back to where we met. I need you to go
and find my mother. Her name is...

00:24.108 --> 00:26.941
- Are you all right?
- I was on the island.

00:27.028 --> 00:31.818
You've been off the island three years.
You're safe now. It was just a dream.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.034
It wasn't a dream, Penny.

00:35.203 --> 00:37.239
It was a memory.

00:51.594 --> 00:53.130
Efren Salonga!

00:53.763 --> 00:56.971
Efren Salonga? Efren Salonga?

01:00.436 --> 01:01.516
Efren Salonga?

01:02.980 --> 01:04.231
Efren Salonga!

01:07.818 --> 01:09.479
Efren Salonga?

01:11.489 --> 01:12.649
Efren Salonga?

01:14.492 --> 01:16.824
- Who are you?
- Are you the doctor?

01:18.204 --> 01:21.287
Yes. What's the matter with you?

01:26.128 --> 01:28.289
- Sure you know what you're doing?
- Yes!

01:28.381 --> 01:30.918
- 'Cause there's a lot of blood.
- How much blood?

01:31.008 --> 01:32.748
I'm coming, Penny!

01:34.971 --> 01:38.964
- It's OK, I've got a doctor.
- Where have you been?

01:40.643 --> 01:42.099
There you are.

01:42.186 --> 01:45.269
OK, just breathe, baby. Just breathe.

01:46.274 --> 01:48.265
- Breathe.
- I can't breathe.

01:48.359 --> 01:50.566
- You're doing great.
- I can't breathe.

01:51.279 --> 01:53.816
OK, just be strong now.

01:53.906 --> 01:56.648
Make it come out!

01:57.827 --> 02:00.284
Hold it, hold it.

02:00.371 --> 02:02.908
- I can't!
- Yes, you can, Penny.

02:02.999 --> 02:07.163
- Push, push.
- OK, big push now. Push!

02:07.253 --> 02:08.959
- Now!
- Come on, Penny.

02:09.046 --> 02:10.547
That's it. It's comin'.

02:10.631 --> 02:11.666
Come on, Penny.

02:11.757 --> 02:15.625
- Push! Harder!
- I can see the head!

02:15.720 --> 02:16.835
One more time, push!

02:16.929 --> 02:20.467
I can see it, it's coming!
You've got it!

02:20.558 --> 02:22.549
Oh, my God, Penny.

02:27.440 --> 02:28.600
You got it.

02:29.442 --> 02:32.434
You did it! Oh, my God, Penny.

02:33.738 --> 02:35.228
It's a boy.

02:37.116 --> 02:39.107
You did it. You did it.

02:43.914 --> 02:45.825
I love you, Penny. I love you.

02:46.792 --> 02:48.623
Oh, he's beautiful.

02:50.963 --> 02:53.340
Oh, my God, he's so beautiful.

02:53.424 --> 02:55.130
Oh, my God.

02:58.137 --> 03:00.719
- I love you.
- I love you.

03:03.267 --> 03:04.598
I love you.

03:24.580 --> 03:27.447
Look. Right out there.

03:30.211 --> 03:32.827
Beyond where you can see,
there is an island.

03:32.922 --> 03:35.504
And it's a very special island.

03:37.468 --> 03:39.709
I left it a longtime ago.

03:39.887 --> 03:41.878
I never thought I'd see it again.

03:44.100 --> 03:46.182
It's called Great Britain.

03:46.268 --> 03:49.852
And the most beautiful part
of the island is Scotland.

03:49.939 --> 03:51.725
That's where your daddy's from.

03:51.816 --> 03:55.980
There's mountains, glens,
and monsters in deep lochs.

03:59.824 --> 04:02.110
And that's where
your mommy and daddy...

04:03.119 --> 04:06.907
- ...fell in love.
- It's also where he broke her heart.

04:13.421 --> 04:16.584
Yeah, well, I thought
I'd leave that bit out of it.

04:18.717 --> 04:21.675
You also left out the bit
about his grandfather...

04:21.762 --> 04:25.254
The man who sent a boat to the island
to kill all of daddy's friends.

04:25.349 --> 04:28.182
We'll be in and out.
He'll never know we're here.

04:29.687 --> 04:31.848
Don't underestimate him, Desmond.

04:33.816 --> 04:36.102
If he finds out,
I don't know what he'll do.

04:36.193 --> 04:38.570
This has nothing to do with your father.

04:40.197 --> 04:42.654
We are here because of Daniel Faraday.

04:45.327 --> 04:46.942
He told me...

04:47.580 --> 04:51.118
...that everyone on that island
is in danger.

04:51.208 --> 04:54.200
And I am the only one
that can help them.

04:58.716 --> 05:00.627
l have to do this, Penny.

05:04.805 --> 05:09.094
- Are you sure that's what he said?
- Yeah. Sawyer said meet at the creek.

05:09.185 --> 05:12.052
So unless he got torched
by a flaming arrow,

05:12.146 --> 05:14.683
that's where he
and everyone else should be.

05:18.235 --> 05:19.645
How's your headache?

05:19.737 --> 05:23.480
Worse, actually, but considering
we're running for our lives,

05:23.574 --> 05:27.237
- I'm not going to complain.
- Any dizziness or double vision?

05:28.454 --> 05:30.570
Both, actually.

05:35.085 --> 05:36.950
Why do you look so worried?

05:42.426 --> 05:47.841
Nothing is going to happen to you,
nothing. lwon't let it.

05:49.892 --> 05:51.382
We're here.

05:56.565 --> 05:58.556
Some rendezvous. It's just us.

05:59.944 --> 06:03.528
We should wait, see if they show up,
they could be right behind us.

06:03.614 --> 06:06.606
- Yeah, or they came and left.
- Or they're dead.

06:06.700 --> 06:10.363
Miles, that right there,
that kind of attitude...

06:10.454 --> 06:14.413
...not exactly what we need right now.
People are scared enough as it is.

06:14.500 --> 06:15.785
Miles...

06:19.797 --> 06:21.458
Miles?

06:28.347 --> 06:29.462
Wait, don't move!

07:03.882 --> 07:07.374
- Who's in charge here?
- He is.

07:16.812 --> 07:19.019
You just couldn't stay away, could you?

07:46.550 --> 07:49.383
- Did he finish his breakfast?
- Yeah.

07:49.470 --> 07:52.212
Gave me a bit of a fight,
but he listens in the end.

07:52.973 --> 07:54.884
Unlike his father.

07:58.062 --> 08:02.897
Look, honey,
all l have to do is find his mother,

08:02.983 --> 08:06.646
tell her he is still on the island,
then I'm done with this for good.

08:06.737 --> 08:11.401
Why now? If he told you this on
the island, why didn't you remember it

08:11.492 --> 08:13.653
- until two days ago?
- I don't know.

08:15.037 --> 08:18.029
I don't understand how this works
any more than you do.

08:19.375 --> 08:21.411
Look, I know it happened.

08:23.796 --> 08:26.162
Daniel Faraday
knocked on the hatch door.

08:27.633 --> 08:30.045
Told me to go to Oxford.

08:30.135 --> 08:33.878
That everyone was in danger and
l was the only one that could save them.

08:37.017 --> 08:39.008
I know how insane it sounds.

08:45.943 --> 08:48.434
I'll be back by dark, and then I'm done.

08:49.446 --> 08:50.856
Forever.

08:52.116 --> 08:53.606
I promise.

09:03.627 --> 09:05.583
If you're gonna promise something,

09:05.671 --> 09:08.128
promise you'll never go back
to that island.

09:09.216 --> 09:11.707
Why in God's name
would I ever go back there?

09:27.651 --> 09:30.484
There were 20 of you at the beach,
but only five here.

09:30.571 --> 09:32.562
Where are the rest of your people?

09:32.656 --> 09:35.068
Maybe they got blown up
by your land mines.

09:35.159 --> 09:37.366
We didn't put them here, you did.

09:41.832 --> 09:46.041
Once we leave here, I will be
out of control of what happens to you.

09:46.128 --> 09:50.212
But if you cooperate now?
Things will go much easier for you.

09:50.299 --> 09:53.336
So where are the rest of your people?

09:56.638 --> 09:58.094
I don't know.

10:10.194 --> 10:11.354
Who are these people?

10:11.445 --> 10:14.482
I didn't have time to ask that
with Frogurt on fire and all.

10:14.573 --> 10:16.484
They attacked us on the beach.

10:16.575 --> 10:19.692
This is a .30 Caliber M-1 Garand rifle.

10:19.787 --> 10:22.278
- Looks new...
- Who cares? Where have you been?

10:22.372 --> 10:24.954
If you've been going through
what I have, James,

10:25.042 --> 10:29.081
maybe the more appropriate question
would be "When the hell have I been?"

10:32.216 --> 10:34.798
- What happened to your leg?
- I got shot.

10:34.885 --> 10:37.217
- By who?
- We can swap stories later.

10:37.304 --> 10:41.798
We told the rest we'd meet at the creek.
To reconnect, we'd better get moving.

10:41.892 --> 10:45.726
Fine. Seeing as we have no rope to make
sure these two don't try to kill us,

10:45.813 --> 10:47.724
guess we're gonna have to shoot 'em.

10:50.359 --> 10:51.348
What?

10:59.034 --> 11:02.117
- What language is that?
- They're speaking Latin.

11:02.204 --> 11:06.038
That one asked why we aren't in uniform,
this one told him to shut up.

11:06.792 --> 11:10.501
And how is it that they know
how to speak Latin, Juliet?

11:10.587 --> 11:12.248
The same reason I do.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.085
Because they're Others.

11:44.621 --> 11:46.122
- Hey.
- Yeah?

11:46.206 --> 11:48.367
We just walked over a fresh grave.

11:49.293 --> 11:51.534
- What?
- Four US soldiers.

11:53.255 --> 11:55.246
Dead just under a month.

11:55.340 --> 11:57.501
Three of them were shot.

11:57.593 --> 12:00.050
One died of radiation poisoning.

12:02.097 --> 12:06.261
Miles, hey... Hey. Did any of them
happen to mention what year it is?

12:06.351 --> 12:07.761
We're here.

12:20.991 --> 12:23.448
Richard? We're back!

12:38.926 --> 12:40.837
We caught these three by the creek.

12:41.803 --> 12:43.668
This one's their leader.

12:51.188 --> 12:53.429
- What's your name?
- What's your name?

12:56.151 --> 12:58.392
My name is Richard Alpert.

13:00.447 --> 13:02.688
I assume you've come back
for your bomb?

13:17.714 --> 13:20.672
No, I'm sorry. I'm not
finding a record of any Faraday.

13:20.759 --> 13:22.795
That's impossible.

13:22.886 --> 13:26.344
I know her son was a professor here,
his name is Daniel Faraday.

13:26.431 --> 13:29.047
- He's in your database.
- No record of any Faraday

13:29.142 --> 13:32.134
- ever having been employed at Oxford.
- I visited him!

13:34.022 --> 13:38.766
I went to his lab. It was in an attic...
It was... above the Physics department.

13:38.860 --> 13:42.478
The archives go back quite far,
perhaps there was a clerical error.

13:42.572 --> 13:44.824
You don't recall
the year when you visited?

13:44.908 --> 13:46.694
The year?

13:49.913 --> 13:51.619
No, I'm...

13:52.499 --> 13:56.333
- I'm not exactly sure...
- Why are you seeking this information?

14:03.218 --> 14:05.129
Sorry I wasted your time.

15:52.702 --> 15:54.317
Yeah, I wouldn't touch that.

15:58.708 --> 16:02.621
I wondered when someone'd figure out
we weren't just fumigating here.

16:06.133 --> 16:08.624
- You a professor?
- No.

16:09.219 --> 16:10.925
Not exactly.

16:11.429 --> 16:14.557
Well... At least you're honest.

16:17.227 --> 16:20.469
- Why did you tell me not to touch it?
- I had to take the rats

16:20.564 --> 16:23.647
he made run through this thing
down to the incinerator

16:23.733 --> 16:25.724
so no one'd find out what he was up to.

16:25.819 --> 16:28.982
- You mean Daniel Faraday.
- You're not the first to poke around

16:29.072 --> 16:30.903
asking about him and his work.

16:31.867 --> 16:36.486
Rumor had it, he was trying
to send rats' brains back in time.

16:36.580 --> 16:38.241
Ridiculous, isn't it?

16:41.418 --> 16:42.578
Aye.

16:42.878 --> 16:45.585
Look, l'll forget you broke my lock

16:45.672 --> 16:48.505
if you tell your mates
that all you found was rubbish

16:48.592 --> 16:50.753
left behind by a madman.

16:59.060 --> 17:00.596
Fair enough.

17:04.191 --> 17:08.525
Faraday. The university says
there's no record of him.

17:08.612 --> 17:11.194
Can you blame them?

17:11.281 --> 17:14.318
I mean, after what he done
to that poor girl?

17:16.494 --> 17:17.995
What girl?

17:26.630 --> 17:28.416
Take it easy!

17:28.965 --> 17:31.422
It's all right, Daniel. I'm fine.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.544
We are so dead.

17:35.639 --> 17:39.257
Hey... No. We are not so dead.
We're gonna be fine.

17:39.351 --> 17:42.468
We need to keep it together
until there's another flash.

17:42.562 --> 17:45.725
- Then all this disappears.
- And when's that gonna happen?

17:45.815 --> 17:47.225
Could be five minutes...

17:47.943 --> 17:51.527
- Could also be 5,000 years.
- That's just awesome.

17:51.613 --> 17:53.729
What is going on, Dan?

17:53.823 --> 17:56.565
- Why are they doing this to us?
- I'm not sure.

17:56.660 --> 17:59.993
But they must think
that we're with the American military.

18:00.080 --> 18:03.288
If that's the case,
our best chance of staying alive

18:03.375 --> 18:06.208
is to let them
keep thinking it, all right?

18:10.048 --> 18:11.959
Sorry, am | interrupting?

18:12.384 --> 18:15.922
Ellie tells me you're not willing
to reveal where your squad is.

18:16.012 --> 18:18.048
Why would I do that?

18:18.139 --> 18:20.596
- So you can kill them?
- We didn't start this.

18:20.684 --> 18:22.390
Your people attacked us.

18:23.687 --> 18:26.144
You come to our island
to run your tests,

18:26.231 --> 18:28.893
fire on us and expect us
not to defend ourselves?

18:28.984 --> 18:32.397
I don't know anything about that.
We are scientists.

18:37.325 --> 18:41.864
- So they sent you to recover it?
- You mean our hydrogen bomb? Yes.

18:43.164 --> 18:47.908
And I'm guessing by this man's radiation
burns the housing's been compromised...

18:48.003 --> 18:49.743
Is that right?

18:50.922 --> 18:53.959
You need to listen to me.
You have an unstable device

18:54.050 --> 18:58.714
that's capable of destroying
this entire island, and it is broken.

18:59.097 --> 19:03.761
If you don't allow me render it inert,
all of us are gonna die. All of us.

19:03.852 --> 19:06.889
How do I know you weren't sent here
on some suicide mission?

19:06.980 --> 19:10.268
That I'll take you out to the bomb
and you'll just detonate it?

19:16.072 --> 19:17.573
Because”.

19:18.241 --> 19:21.404
...l'm in love with the woman
sitting next to me.

19:26.875 --> 19:28.615
And I would never...

19:30.837 --> 19:32.919
I would never do anything to hurt her.

19:38.762 --> 19:40.252
All right.

19:41.222 --> 19:45.090
Take care of your bomb. But if you
try anything else, you will hurt her.

19:58.239 --> 20:01.367
- So who taught you Latin?
- Others 101.

20:01.451 --> 20:05.160
You gotta learn Latin,
it's the language of the enlightened.

20:05.246 --> 20:07.407
Enlightened my ass.

20:07.957 --> 20:10.790
I would suggest you talk to us.

20:10.877 --> 20:13.664
Once we get to the creek
and meet up with our people,

20:13.755 --> 20:16.963
there's going to be anger
directed at you for attacking them.

20:17.050 --> 20:20.008
The rest of your people
are either captured or dead.

20:20.095 --> 20:21.130
What?

20:23.056 --> 20:24.796
What makes you say that?

20:27.811 --> 20:30.052
That idiot shouted, "Meet at the creek."

20:33.525 --> 20:37.143
We knew exactly where they were headed.
Sent a group after them.

20:37.237 --> 20:39.694
Maybe I should've said it
in my secret language.

20:39.781 --> 20:41.021
James, wait.

20:47.163 --> 20:49.154
What the hell are you saying?

21:04.013 --> 21:07.380
- Did you just say Richard Alpert?
- John, please...

21:29.247 --> 21:30.783
All right.

21:32.208 --> 21:36.577
We need to head east another couple
kilometers until we hit the ridge...

21:39.215 --> 21:40.500
Shoot him!

21:43.595 --> 21:45.051
Shoot, damn it!

21:50.685 --> 21:52.926
Are you crazy?
What were you thinking?

21:53.021 --> 21:54.557
Why didn't you shoot him?

21:57.192 --> 21:58.853
Because”.

21:59.694 --> 22:01.355
...he's one of my people.

22:32.101 --> 22:34.717
- And who might you be?
- My name's Desmond Hume.

22:34.812 --> 22:38.179
- I'm looking for Theresa Spencer?
- l'm Abigail Spencer.

22:38.274 --> 22:40.765
- Theresa's my sister.
- Oh, right...

22:40.860 --> 22:42.316
Can I have a word with her?

22:42.403 --> 22:44.439
- You want to speak to Theresa?
- Yeah.

22:44.531 --> 22:47.489
I got her name from a gentleman
at Oxford University.

22:48.952 --> 22:51.113
- Daniel Faraday...
- Daniel Faraday?

22:52.789 --> 22:57.453
Well, why didn't you say so?
Please, you must come in!

23:02.799 --> 23:04.414
Thanks.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.686
He didn't tell you, did he?

23:24.362 --> 23:26.603
No... No, he didn't.

23:27.991 --> 23:30.778
- Can she hear us?
- No.

23:30.868 --> 23:33.826
- Theresa's away right now.
- Away? What do you mean?

23:33.913 --> 23:38.247
Sometimes she wakes up, thinks she's
three, wants to know where her dolly is.

23:38.334 --> 23:43.249
Yesterday, she was talking to our dad.
He died five years ago.

23:43.339 --> 23:44.590
I'm sorry.

23:45.425 --> 23:48.007
This was a mistake.
I shouldn't have come.

23:49.262 --> 23:52.550
Of course. Why would you want to stay?

23:53.266 --> 23:55.177
Daniel certainly didn't.

23:58.730 --> 23:59.936
He left her like this?

24:00.023 --> 24:04.687
Went running off to the States, never to
be heard from again. He abandoned her.

24:06.529 --> 24:08.235
What kind of man does that?

24:11.618 --> 24:15.657
I don't know what we would have done
if it hadn't been for Mr. Widmore.

24:16.289 --> 24:20.077
- I'm sorry, who?
- Daniel's benefactor.

24:20.168 --> 24:24.457
He funded his research and took
responsibility for the result of it.

24:24.547 --> 24:27.914
He's been taking care of Theresa
ever since this happened to her.

24:29.052 --> 24:32.294
Everything here is due
to Mr. Widmore, God bless him.

24:36.684 --> 24:40.597
A hydrogen bomb? Seriously?

24:42.482 --> 24:47.442
Back in the 50s, the US government
tested H-bombs in the South Pacific.

24:51.032 --> 24:52.522
Lucky us.

24:58.456 --> 25:01.163
- You didn't have to say that.
- Say what?

25:02.001 --> 25:03.662
That you loved me.

25:05.213 --> 25:07.169
There are other ways you could've

25:07.256 --> 25:10.419
convinced him you weren't
going to blow up the island.

25:12.762 --> 25:14.627
I said what I said...

25:16.557 --> 25:18.764
...because I meant it, Charlotte.

25:24.148 --> 25:25.763
All right, then.

25:27.735 --> 25:29.236
Let's go.

25:31.948 --> 25:33.529
Back soon, I promise.

25:53.136 --> 25:58.472
Whatever your superiors told you...
I want you to know the truth.

25:59.976 --> 26:03.059
A month ago we found 18 members
of an army battalion,

26:03.146 --> 26:05.808
right here, in ourjungle,
setting up this camp.

26:05.898 --> 26:09.140
We gave them the opportunity
to leave the island peacefully.

26:09.235 --> 26:12.352
They weren't willing to do that.
l was forced to kill them.

26:12.447 --> 26:14.062
All of them.

26:15.283 --> 26:16.898
- Forced?
- Yeah.

26:17.827 --> 26:19.363
By whom?

26:20.955 --> 26:24.243
You answer to someone don't you?
You follow a chain of command?

26:24.333 --> 26:26.949
- Right? Well, so do |.
-Yeah...

26:27.670 --> 26:30.002
Richard! Richard!

26:32.759 --> 26:35.216
- What happened to you?
- Cunningham and l...

26:35.303 --> 26:38.761
A group of them surprised us.
We were outnumbered, but I escaped.

26:38.848 --> 26:41.715
- Outnumbered?
- Shut up, Ellie.

26:42.518 --> 26:43.849
Who's this?

26:43.936 --> 26:46.222
He's going to help our problem.
Get going.

26:46.314 --> 26:50.227
- He's one of them! You can't trust him.
- You heard me, Ellie. Go.

26:50.318 --> 26:52.934
- How did you escape?
- I ran.

26:53.029 --> 26:55.441
- Never occurred they might follow?
- Follow me?

26:55.531 --> 26:58.022
Their leader is some sodding old man.

26:58.701 --> 27:03.240
You think he can track me? You think
he knows this island better than I do?

27:12.632 --> 27:15.044
How did you know
Richard would be here?

27:15.134 --> 27:17.591
Richard's always been here.

27:19.388 --> 27:23.051
- How old is he?
- Old.

27:23.267 --> 27:25.758
Why are you so interested
in Richard, John?

27:25.853 --> 27:30.768
I'm interested in him because he was
about to tell me how I could save us.

27:31.234 --> 27:33.316
- Save us?
- Yeah.

27:33.402 --> 27:38.442
But, before he could finish, we were
interrupted by that flash of light.

27:38.533 --> 27:40.865
I'm hoping we can pick up
where we left off.

27:41.077 --> 27:45.161
I hate to bust up the l'm-an-Other
you're-an-Other reunion, but Faraday?

27:45.248 --> 27:49.116
The guy that's gonna save us
is being death-marched into the jungle.

27:49.210 --> 27:50.825
Good luck with that.

27:52.255 --> 27:54.997
- You're not gonna help me save him?
- No.

27:55.091 --> 27:58.333
I'm gonna go down and
finish my conversation with Richard.

27:58.427 --> 28:02.340
That's gonna get us killed. You go in,
they're gonna know we're here.

28:02.431 --> 28:05.218
Fair enough. I'll give you
ten minutes head start.

28:09.772 --> 28:12.184
What about you?

28:12.275 --> 28:15.108
Wanna stay in Crazytown,
or help me rescue the geek?

28:17.405 --> 28:20.522
- Why do you keep looking at me?
- I'm not.

28:20.616 --> 28:22.277
You are.

28:23.953 --> 28:26.365
You know what? You're right. I'm sorry.

28:26.455 --> 28:28.741
It's just...

28:28.833 --> 28:31.449
...you look so much like...

28:32.962 --> 28:34.543
...someone I used to know.

28:34.630 --> 28:37.997
Someone other than the girl
you just professed your love for?

28:38.092 --> 28:41.255
- Well, aren't you the Romeo?
- Far from it. Believe me.

28:43.848 --> 28:45.964
I don't believe you, by the way.

28:46.934 --> 28:50.392
You may have Richard fooled,
but you can't expect me to believe

28:50.479 --> 28:54.893
that you, a British woman and Chinese
man are members of the US military.

29:07.288 --> 29:09.495
You want to know who I am?

29:11.751 --> 29:15.619
I am your best chance
at disarming that bomb.

29:18.341 --> 29:20.252
All right, then.

29:20.343 --> 29:22.049
Disarm it.

30:01.884 --> 30:04.296
What are you doing up there?

30:07.014 --> 30:09.221
l'm examining it.

30:31.038 --> 30:33.700
- Back up. Get back, get back.
- What?

30:33.791 --> 30:35.952
lt's unsafe, we need to move.

30:37.670 --> 30:41.208
- I swear, if you try anything...
- If I try anything?

30:41.298 --> 30:43.505
You're gonna shoot me, is that right?

30:43.592 --> 30:47.255
Yeah, that would be perfect
because rifle fire

30:47.346 --> 30:50.964
right next to... what would you call
this... hydrogen bomb...

30:51.058 --> 30:54.425
Yes, fantastic idea. Really inspired.

30:55.855 --> 30:57.186
OK, listen to me.

30:57.273 --> 31:00.561
Do you people have any access
to lead or concrete?

31:00.651 --> 31:03.028
- For what?
- There's a crack in the casing.

31:03.112 --> 31:04.852
It needs to be filled with lead,

31:04.947 --> 31:08.610
and you need to take it off
this platform, carefully, and bury it.

31:08.701 --> 31:11.158
You brought me here
to tell us we have to bury it?

31:11.245 --> 31:13.201
You told Alpert you could disarm it.

31:13.289 --> 31:16.031
You don't need to worry,
if you do what I say, bury it,

31:16.125 --> 31:19.288
- it won't go off.
- How do you know that?

31:19.378 --> 31:21.710
- I need you to trust me.
- I don't trust you.

31:21.797 --> 31:25.210
Just bury it.
Bury it and everything will be fine.

31:25.301 --> 31:27.337
- Your superiors...
- How can you be sure?

31:27.428 --> 31:29.760
- To take care of this bomb, bury it!
- How do you know?

31:29.847 --> 31:34.341
Because 50 years from now
this island is still here!

31:37.271 --> 31:38.807
What did you just say?

31:40.191 --> 31:43.729
Take it easy.
I can explain myself a little better.

31:43.819 --> 31:45.730
I know how this sounds, believe me.

31:45.821 --> 31:48.073
It's hard to explain...

31:48.157 --> 31:51.490
Fifty years from now me and my...

31:52.286 --> 31:55.949
...me and my friends...
that's where we're from, OK?

31:56.040 --> 32:00.750
And, here's the key,
everything is fine, not perfectly fine,

32:00.836 --> 32:05.705
but there hasn't been
any atomic blast...

32:05.800 --> 32:07.210
Drop the gun, Blondie!

32:10.346 --> 32:14.214
It's OK. She's OK.
You can put your gun down.

32:14.308 --> 32:16.139
She puts hers down first.

32:19.063 --> 32:21.270
Why don't we all put our guns down?

32:23.651 --> 32:25.187
I said drop it!

32:36.330 --> 32:38.446
Son of a bitch.

32:40.292 --> 32:42.408
Are they from the future, too?

32:45.005 --> 32:46.506
You told her?

32:53.389 --> 32:55.926
Sir... Sir, you can't...

32:59.228 --> 33:02.140
Mr. Widmore, I'm so sorry.

33:02.231 --> 33:05.189
- He charged right past me.
- That's all right, Melanie.

33:05.276 --> 33:09.235
Mr. Hume is a... colleague of mine.

33:15.161 --> 33:16.947
Please, leave us.

33:29.216 --> 33:31.832
I know you have questions for me.

33:31.927 --> 33:35.511
I'm not gonna answer them.
I've come here to ask you something.

33:35.598 --> 33:39.807
Once you've told me everything I need
to know, you'll never see me again.

33:41.604 --> 33:42.844
Understand?

33:45.107 --> 33:46.187
All right.

33:46.275 --> 33:48.982
I need to know where I can find
Daniel Faraday's mother.

33:52.865 --> 33:55.527
What makes you think
I know the answer to that?

33:55.618 --> 34:00.237
Because before you put Faraday on your
little boat and sent him to the island,

34:00.331 --> 34:02.913
you'd spent ten years
funding his research.

34:05.461 --> 34:08.077
So I figured you must know something...

34:08.172 --> 34:10.413
...regarding his next of kin.

34:12.051 --> 34:17.296
Desmond, I haven't seen or heard
from my daughter for three years.

34:17.389 --> 34:19.129
Just answer me this...

34:20.184 --> 34:21.924
Is she safe?

34:23.979 --> 34:25.765
Where's Faraday's mother?

34:38.452 --> 34:40.613
She's in Los Angeles.

34:44.124 --> 34:46.160
This is an address for her.

34:49.213 --> 34:52.376
I suspect she won't
be pleased to see you.

34:52.466 --> 34:54.627
She's a very private person.

35:08.857 --> 35:10.813
Wait, Desmond.

35:17.491 --> 35:22.451
Deliver your message,
and then get out of this mess.

35:22.538 --> 35:26.781
- Don't put Penny's life in danger.
- Danger?

35:26.875 --> 35:30.333
You're getting involved in something
that goes back many years.

35:30.421 --> 35:32.833
It has nothing to do
with you or my daughter.

35:33.716 --> 35:35.456
Wherever you were hiding...

35:36.552 --> 35:38.088
...go back there.

35:40.472 --> 35:42.258
Thanks for the advice.

35:54.236 --> 35:56.067
Richard Alpert!

35:56.822 --> 35:58.733
Hey. Hey!

35:58.824 --> 36:01.440
- I'm looking for Richard.
- Don't move.

36:01.535 --> 36:03.992
- Richard Alpert!
- On the ground, now!

36:04.079 --> 36:06.491
- I need to talk to you!
- Shut your mouth!

36:06.582 --> 36:08.118
That's enough.

36:24.892 --> 36:26.757
My name is John Locke.

36:28.687 --> 36:30.928
Is that supposed to mean
something to me?

36:37.237 --> 36:38.488
Jacob sent me.

36:48.707 --> 36:50.698
- Put the gun down.
- What?

36:52.044 --> 36:54.126
You can't seriously trust him.

36:56.215 --> 36:59.628
I said put the gun down, Widmore.

37:04.390 --> 37:06.426
Your name is Widmore?

37:08.811 --> 37:12.474
- Charles Widmore?
- What's it to you?

37:15.692 --> 37:18.229
Nothing. It's nice to meet you.

37:28.539 --> 37:30.120
Where?

37:46.598 --> 37:48.589
- Good day?
- Yeah.

37:49.393 --> 37:52.430
He wanted to go fishing in the Thames.

37:52.521 --> 37:54.933
We were unsuccessful.

37:55.023 --> 37:57.935
And you? Did you find Faraday's mum?

37:59.069 --> 38:01.481
There's no one to find.

38:01.572 --> 38:02.778
She...

38:05.784 --> 38:07.615
She died a few years ago.

38:13.208 --> 38:15.164
Why are you lying to me?

38:16.503 --> 38:19.461
- What? I'm not...
- Where is she?

38:27.055 --> 38:28.716
She's in Los Angeles.

38:31.393 --> 38:33.634
Look, you've got nothing to worry about.

38:33.729 --> 38:35.811
This was a mistake.

38:35.898 --> 38:39.891
I made a promise that this would
be done in a day, and now it's done.

38:40.319 --> 38:42.184
It's not our problem anymore.

38:43.155 --> 38:46.238
- What if you remember something else?
- l'll forget it.

38:46.325 --> 38:50.159
- And the next day?
- l'll forget it! It doesn't matter.

38:50.245 --> 38:52.236
You're my life now. You and Charlie.

38:57.878 --> 38:59.789
I won't leave you again.

39:02.216 --> 39:03.922
Not for this...

39:05.594 --> 39:07.380
...not for anything.

39:23.487 --> 39:25.273
You'll never forget it.

39:27.908 --> 39:29.899
So I guess we're going with you.

39:47.803 --> 39:49.293
I gave you this?

39:50.556 --> 39:52.922
- Yes.
- After you were shot in the leg

39:53.016 --> 39:55.598
and I wandered out of the jungle
to patch you up?

39:55.686 --> 39:58.974
- That's right.
- And why don't I remember...

39:59.856 --> 40:02.393
- ...any of this?
- It hasn't happened yet.

40:05.654 --> 40:08.111
I'm not sure what
you're expecting me to say.

40:08.198 --> 40:10.439
I expect you to tell me
how to get off the island.

40:10.534 --> 40:12.820
That's privileged. Why would I share it?

40:12.911 --> 40:17.575
You told me I had something
very important to do once I get there.

40:20.794 --> 40:22.409
And because I'm your leader.

40:23.380 --> 40:26.372
- You're my leader?
- That's what you told me.

40:26.466 --> 40:29.299
I certainly don't want to
contradict myself,

40:29.386 --> 40:33.379
but we have a very specific process
for selecting our leadership.

40:33.473 --> 40:36.180
It starts at a very, very young age.

40:36.268 --> 40:38.850
All right... all right.

40:40.772 --> 40:42.979
What year is it right now?

40:43.066 --> 40:45.398
It's 1954.

40:47.362 --> 40:52.277
All right. May 30, 1956. Two years
from now. That's the day I'm born.

40:52.367 --> 40:57.202
Tustin, California. If you don't
believe me, | suggest you come visit me.

41:00.959 --> 41:02.995
- Oh, no...
- What's wrong?

41:03.962 --> 41:05.873
It's about to happen again.

41:07.549 --> 41:10.256
You need to tell me now.
How do | get off the island?

41:10.844 --> 41:12.004
Please, tell me!

41:35.077 --> 41:39.320
- You all right?
- Yeah... I think so.

41:40.624 --> 41:42.410
Charlotte!

41:47.005 --> 41:49.212
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

41:50.676 --> 41:53.418
Yeah, me, too. I'm great, too.

42:07.109 --> 42:09.100
Charlotte! Charlotte!

42:10.278 --> 42:14.487
Charlotte. No, no, look at me. It's OK.

42:15.450 --> 42:16.951
Charlotte!
