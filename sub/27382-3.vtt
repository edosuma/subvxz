WEBVTT

00:02.523 --> 00:06.712
This programme contains some scenes
which some viewers may find
upsetting and some strong language.

00:06.712 --> 00:08.539
Madame Ascher was
wearing new stockings.

00:08.539 --> 00:10.971
Betty Barnard was strangled
with the same make of stockings.

00:10.971 --> 00:13.851
Come on, just a short stroll.

00:13.851 --> 00:15.643
There must be a code.

00:15.643 --> 00:18.075
There is a code. The code is me.

00:18.075 --> 00:20.315
Oh, Mr Cust, you're the killer.

00:20.315 --> 00:22.363
I'm a travelling salesman.
I sell stockings.

00:22.363 --> 02:02.075
We must prepare
for the wrath of God.

02:02.075 --> 03:01.595
HE SIGHS

03:01.595 --> 03:04.672
There he is!Are you making
any progress, Inspector?

03:04.672 --> 03:12.859
THEY SHOUT OVER EACH OTHER

03:12.859 --> 03:22.011
Is the killer even English?

03:22.011 --> 04:18.352
CLOCK TICKS GENTLY

04:18.352 --> 04:20.891
No, leave my clothes.

04:20.891 --> 04:27.832
I'll put them away myself.

04:27.832 --> 05:01.915
DOOR CLOSES

05:01.915 --> 05:33.915
Franklin.

05:33.915 --> 06:14.299
Good morning.

06:14.299 --> 06:17.051
Seem rather poorly, Mr Cust.

06:17.051 --> 06:38.235
You seem very poorly in your head.

06:38.235 --> 06:43.867
I don't want to be a monster.

06:43.867 --> 06:46.363
Why isn't he writing?

06:46.363 --> 06:49.115
Because this wasn't
part of the plan.

06:49.115 --> 06:51.112
This wasn't prepared.

06:51.112 --> 06:55.579
The mistake at Doncaster
has changed everything.

06:55.579 --> 07:00.712
We will not receive
any more letters.

07:00.712 --> 07:03.323
You'd think he'd know
what I said by now.

07:03.323 --> 07:05.179
I know what they say to me.

07:05.179 --> 07:08.955
It's what they say about the killer
that I'm looking for.

07:08.955 --> 07:11.032
They say he's mad.
More than that.

07:11.032 --> 07:16.507
Words speak us
more than we speak them.

07:16.507 --> 07:18.363
Words speak us.

07:18.363 --> 07:20.155
Clear as mud.

07:20.155 --> 07:23.632
Sir, you should remember
what they did to Japp,

07:23.632 --> 07:26.875
because...

07:26.875 --> 07:29.512
And you're sneaking him in
up the back stairs!

07:29.512 --> 07:31.163
Getting me to sneak him in.

07:31.163 --> 07:35.195
Go and make me a cup of tea.

07:35.195 --> 07:37.243
That's not really my job, sir.
It is now.

07:37.243 --> 07:40.443
Happy days, you got promoted.
Two sugars.

07:40.443 --> 07:44.923
"I will be a faceless beast."

07:44.923 --> 07:47.995
"Faceless beast."

07:47.995 --> 07:50.235
Why faceless?

07:50.235 --> 07:52.731
Because it's more frightening.

07:52.731 --> 07:57.352
Because we don't know who he is.
Or because I do.

07:57.352 --> 08:03.832
They know me, they dress like me,
so, somehow, I must know them, too.

08:03.832 --> 08:07.515
I must know their face.

08:07.515 --> 08:11.931
I must.
Why ARE they dressing like you?

08:11.931 --> 08:16.859
What did you do to make them
hate you so much?

08:16.859 --> 08:21.723
I do not know.

08:21.723 --> 08:24.539
You said the killer had details
about your life

08:24.539 --> 08:27.611
from the moment you got here.

08:27.611 --> 08:32.632
What about before 1914?

08:32.632 --> 08:37.147
Could someone have followed you
here, someone who hates you?

08:37.147 --> 08:41.435
Or a son of someone who hates you?

08:41.435 --> 08:44.392
What about before...

08:44.392 --> 08:46.683
..in Belgium?

08:46.683 --> 08:52.379
It is not relevant.

08:52.379 --> 08:57.627
Where's my bloody tea?

08:57.627 --> 09:09.403
DOOR CLOSES

09:09.403 --> 09:10.683
GUNSHOT

09:10.683 --> 09:38.523
THEY SCREAM

09:38.523 --> 09:42.363
STEAM TRAIN POWERS ALONG

09:42.363 --> 09:50.107
TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS

09:50.107 --> 09:59.003
Embsay, next station.

09:59.003 --> 10:16.603
Next station is Embsay.

10:16.603 --> 10:20.955
RADIO:Police sources say the murder
of comedian Benny Groom in Doncaster

10:20.955 --> 10:28.072
two days ago by the killer known
as ABC was likely to be an error.

10:28.072 --> 10:31.963
But would neither confirm nor deny
if this meant that the previous

10:31.963 --> 10:34.779
pattern of killings,
based on the victim's name,

10:34.779 --> 10:37.432
was still applicable.

10:37.432 --> 10:41.632
Nonetheless, towns and villages
across the country beginning

10:41.632 --> 10:46.363
with the letter E
are paralysed with fear.

10:46.363 --> 10:51.483
Meanwhile, the murders of Alice
Ascher, Elizabeth "Betty" Barnard

10:51.483 --> 10:55.131
and Sir Carmichael Clarke
remain unsolved,

10:55.131 --> 12:33.371
and the perpetrator
remains at large.

12:33.371 --> 13:08.443
HE WHISTLES

13:08.443 --> 13:10.363
You all right in there, sir?

13:10.363 --> 13:12.731
HE KNOCKS ON DOOR

13:12.731 --> 13:14.523
You all right in there?

13:14.523 --> 13:16.315
HE BANGS ON DOOR

13:16.315 --> 13:21.563
HE OPENS DOOR

13:21.563 --> 13:24.251
Jesus...

13:24.251 --> 13:26.171
Call the police!

13:26.171 --> 13:41.595
Call the police! Help!

13:41.595 --> 14:13.552
Help!

14:13.552 --> 14:15.352
The killer is at large.

14:15.352 --> 14:17.179
He could still be
in the Embsay area.

14:17.179 --> 14:20.699
I want every inch of ground covered,
every morsel of evidence gathered.

14:20.699 --> 14:22.491
Let's get this bastard.

14:22.491 --> 14:34.651
You heard the inspector. Come on!

14:34.651 --> 14:44.699
Found it, sir, the knife!

14:44.699 --> 14:51.291
Edwards, Ernie Edwards -
a gent, always very polite.

14:51.291 --> 14:54.747
We've got the knife.
And his hat and coat.

14:54.747 --> 15:03.323
There's nothing in the pockets,
but we've got them.

15:03.323 --> 15:05.115
Was he married?

15:05.115 --> 15:06.907
A widower.

15:06.907 --> 15:21.051
But word is he had a lady friend.

15:21.051 --> 16:11.611
Men buy lady friends gifts.

16:11.611 --> 16:13.339
Shops will fleece you
every which way.

16:13.339 --> 16:15.387
They're a bastard, shops.

16:15.387 --> 16:18.843
But door-to-door, now that's gold.

16:18.843 --> 16:20.891
No overheads, see? Salesmen.

16:20.891 --> 16:22.939
Salesmen - they buy the stock,

16:22.939 --> 16:26.779
they're responsible for the stock,
they sell, they earn.

16:26.779 --> 16:29.787
It's got sod all to do with me.

16:29.787 --> 16:31.672
Sound simple? I wish.

16:31.672 --> 16:35.739
Got ulcers eating me alive.

16:35.739 --> 16:40.923
WHISPERS:I've got haemorrhoids.
Oh, God's curse.

16:40.923 --> 16:44.187
Now, Mr Poirot,
what is it that you wanted?

16:44.187 --> 16:47.451
A list of your salespeople.

16:47.451 --> 16:49.192
Yvonne! Did you hear that?

16:49.192 --> 16:51.419
In London, Monsieur Prynne.

16:51.419 --> 16:52.912
London?

16:52.912 --> 16:55.899
We don't do London.
Twinkle Toes is strictly north -

16:55.899 --> 16:58.267
Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool,
Newcastle.

16:58.267 --> 17:00.472
Never London - I hate cockneys.

17:00.472 --> 17:02.752
They're villains,
every single last one of them.

17:02.752 --> 17:04.731
Had a bulk buy.

17:04.731 --> 17:07.611
London, PO Box in Fulham,
did it meself.

17:07.611 --> 17:09.979
Yvonne! You know how I feel!

17:09.979 --> 17:11.771
It was a bulk buy, Sydney.

17:11.771 --> 17:13.115
HE SIGHS

17:13.115 --> 17:14.971
The name of the person ordering?

17:14.971 --> 17:18.491
No name, just the request
and cash in an envelope.

17:18.491 --> 17:21.819
We did get a letter
from a fruitcake in London, though.

17:21.819 --> 17:25.083
Well, you get habituated to funny
letters when you're in ladies' hose.

17:25.083 --> 17:28.552
Some of the things they write,
they make your hair stand on end!

17:28.552 --> 17:32.187
Do you still have that letter,
Madame?

17:32.187 --> 17:34.811
Er...

17:34.811 --> 17:39.739
That young lady that was
strangled with a stocking,

17:39.739 --> 17:43.579
by ABC in that beach hut...

17:43.579 --> 17:45.371
..her stocking, wasn't it...

17:45.371 --> 17:47.483
..wasn't a Twinkle Toes, was it?

17:47.483 --> 17:49.467
It was.

17:49.467 --> 17:50.875
Oh. Poor kid.

17:50.875 --> 17:52.731
This is it.

17:52.731 --> 17:56.251
"Dear sirs, I followed
your instructions to the letter,

17:56.251 --> 17:59.195
"and am now in residence and ready
to begin my venture

17:59.195 --> 18:01.051
"with Twinkle Toes.

18:01.051 --> 18:04.315
"The coat is the best quality
that I have ever owned

18:04.315 --> 18:07.963
"and I will take very good care
of it, and only wear it when engaged

18:07.963 --> 18:09.371
"upon your business."

18:09.371 --> 18:12.123
Coat? Coat? What's he talking about?

18:12.123 --> 18:14.619
"I promise that I will be
a most loyal

18:14.619 --> 18:17.691
"and dedicated
representative of your product.

18:17.691 --> 18:24.795
"Yours faithfully,
Alexander Beakles..."

18:24.795 --> 18:37.019
May I?

18:37.019 --> 18:42.651
"I followed your instructions
to the letter."

18:42.651 --> 18:45.531
I need to make a telephone call.

18:45.531 --> 18:47.963
SIREN FLARES

18:47.963 --> 18:51.232
BRAKES SQUEAL

18:51.232 --> 18:52.635
What did I tell you, eh?

18:52.635 --> 18:54.427
Always the quiet ones, always.

18:54.427 --> 18:56.667
There, you see, I was right.

18:56.667 --> 18:59.675
That's why you should listen
to me. I know things.

18:59.675 --> 19:19.003
SHE SIGHS

19:19.003 --> 19:27.579
We've got him.

19:27.579 --> 19:31.227
Why don't you come
in the house, miss?

19:31.227 --> 19:54.592
Sit quietly with your mother
till this is done.

19:54.592 --> 20:07.579
HE PANTS

20:07.579 --> 20:10.715
Ellie?
Don't go back to the house.

20:10.715 --> 20:13.467
What?
Police are here for you.

20:13.467 --> 20:16.312
Don't go back.

20:16.312 --> 20:19.099
Go somewhere else, Mr Cust.

20:19.099 --> 20:23.032
Go quick.

20:23.032 --> 20:25.691
Alexander Bonaparte Cust...

20:25.691 --> 20:28.443
..ABC.
Run!

20:28.443 --> 20:34.843
Run!

20:34.843 --> 20:43.931
TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS

20:43.931 --> 21:29.499
Go! Go! Go!

21:29.499 --> 21:33.112
HE SCREAMS

21:33.112 --> 21:36.352
HE STRUGGLES

21:36.352 --> 22:09.051
TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS

22:09.051 --> 22:10.843
I want him alive!

22:10.843 --> 22:23.451
Don't you dare let him die,
I want him alive!

22:23.451 --> 22:27.419
You dusted the typewriter
for fingerprints?

22:27.419 --> 22:31.131
All his, except for a few.

22:31.131 --> 22:33.179
He planned it all in here.

22:33.179 --> 22:35.547
It's a real shithole.

22:35.547 --> 22:37.083
Appropriate, really.

22:37.083 --> 22:39.771
Will he live?
Long enough.

22:39.771 --> 22:41.947
Some sort of brain growth,
apparently.

22:41.947 --> 22:44.763
He's a strange one, no mistake.

22:44.763 --> 22:46.939
When they stripped him off
at the hospital,

22:46.939 --> 22:48.859
they found all these holes
in his back,

22:48.859 --> 22:51.112
like he'd been hammering nails
into himself.

22:51.112 --> 22:53.752
Religious fanatic, maybe.

22:53.752 --> 22:55.963
Makes no odds. He'll face trial.

22:55.963 --> 22:58.651
Tumour won't kill him,
the law will do that.

22:58.651 --> 23:00.472
I wish to see him.

23:00.472 --> 23:04.731
And please telephone your colleagues
in Andover

23:04.731 --> 23:08.512
and ensure that Peter Ascher
is released from prison.

23:08.512 --> 23:11.579
He is innocent.

23:11.579 --> 23:23.099
Forgot about him.

23:23.099 --> 23:27.963
He said I was a...good man.

23:27.963 --> 23:31.355
Japp told you I was a...

23:31.355 --> 23:32.891
..good man.

23:32.891 --> 23:36.731
He did.

23:36.731 --> 23:40.827
Well, he'd be pleased with this.

23:40.827 --> 23:42.712
The result.

23:42.712 --> 23:45.627
He'd be pleased.

23:45.627 --> 23:49.403
That was a good hunch
on the stockings.

23:49.403 --> 24:11.355
You were right about them.

24:11.355 --> 24:13.552
I was listening.

24:13.552 --> 24:17.499
Are you going to see him?

24:17.499 --> 24:22.875
I am.

24:22.875 --> 24:25.371
Will you tell him I've got
his backgammon case?

24:25.371 --> 24:26.779
I sneaked it away.

24:26.779 --> 24:28.379
Got it hidden.

24:28.379 --> 24:31.643
He might want it.

24:31.643 --> 24:34.523
He's very sick, Mademoiselle.

24:34.523 --> 24:37.339
I thought he was poorly.

24:37.339 --> 24:39.003
Tell me, Mademoiselle...

24:39.003 --> 24:42.843
Lily, just Lily.

24:42.843 --> 24:47.835
Mr Cust received no visitors,
but did he receive letters?

24:47.835 --> 24:50.139
He got parcels that came
before he arrived,

24:50.139 --> 24:53.211
and then a letter and parcels
came later.

24:53.211 --> 24:58.203
And they would have arrived
after the Doncaster murder?

24:58.203 --> 25:02.939
Yeah. They did.

25:02.939 --> 25:07.803
You warned him because you thought
he could not have done it. Why?

25:07.803 --> 25:10.299
Tell me how Mr Cust could
have killed that man

25:10.299 --> 25:13.312
in Doncaster during the four o'clock
   race, and be home by seven.

25:13.312 --> 25:15.739
I know he was home
by seven because...

25:15.739 --> 25:21.592
You were walking on his back,
and you'd broken a sharp heel.

25:21.592 --> 25:24.699
The pain of that would
have been a distraction

25:24.699 --> 25:29.947
from the agony in his skull.

25:29.947 --> 25:32.187
Those floors want mopping.

25:32.187 --> 25:35.032
You're on borrowed time
with me, girl.

25:35.032 --> 25:37.499
I wish I'd used a knitting
needle on you.

25:37.499 --> 25:41.083
Get out of my sight!

25:41.083 --> 25:54.139
You abuse your daughter, Madame?

25:54.139 --> 25:56.059
How long are you going to be?

25:56.059 --> 26:07.912
As long as I want.

26:07.912 --> 26:11.803
Hanging's too good for him,
what he did to our darling Betty.

26:11.803 --> 26:13.851
I'd put the rope around
his neck myself,

26:13.851 --> 26:49.563
and there's not a man in England
who'd judge me for it.

26:49.563 --> 26:56.283
SHE CRIES

26:56.283 --> 27:13.947
Lady...Thora...Clarke.

27:13.947 --> 27:19.707
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

27:19.707 --> 27:25.723
POIROT: Do you know me?

27:25.723 --> 27:27.579
I know of you.

27:27.579 --> 27:35.451
But you wrote me this intimate
letter, and many others.

27:35.451 --> 27:38.779
"I followed you the other day.

27:38.779 --> 27:41.992
"You looked old and tired.

27:41.992 --> 27:44.032
"You looked sad.

27:44.032 --> 27:47.675
"I was rather concerned for you."

27:47.675 --> 27:51.387
I don't remember writing this.

27:51.387 --> 27:54.971
I must have done.

27:54.971 --> 27:56.635
I say that.

27:56.635 --> 28:00.923
"Chin-chin."

28:00.923 --> 28:03.232
And I went to all of those places.

28:03.232 --> 28:08.283
They were all on the list
that Twinkle Toes gave me.

28:08.283 --> 28:11.547
The list?

28:11.547 --> 28:16.219
They said it was easier for
new salesmen to work alphabetically.

28:16.219 --> 28:17.691
They sent a list.

28:17.691 --> 28:20.763
It was so helpful.

28:20.763 --> 28:23.899
I wasn't very good
at selling stockings, though.

28:23.899 --> 28:31.771
Mr Cust, the manager of Twinkle Toes
has never heard of you.

28:31.771 --> 28:35.419
How did you acquire the typewriter?

28:35.419 --> 28:37.659
It was given to me.

28:37.659 --> 28:41.563
And was the idea to sell
stockings door-to-door

28:41.563 --> 28:45.147
given to you as well...

28:45.147 --> 28:50.651
..by someone whom you had
once played backgammon with?

28:50.651 --> 28:52.891
You lost to them but they were kind,

28:52.891 --> 28:56.091
suggested a way in which
you could make a living,

28:56.091 --> 28:59.291
suggested a place
where you could find a room,

28:59.291 --> 29:02.427
and then the packages of stockings
arrived,

29:02.427 --> 29:07.099
and the ABC railway guides, and the
clothes, so you could be smart,

29:07.099 --> 29:09.339
make a good impression.

29:09.339 --> 29:12.411
The hat, coat.

29:12.411 --> 29:17.152
Yes.And you got instructions,
where to go, what date,

29:17.152 --> 29:21.712
a list of names and addresses
where you might sell the stockings

29:21.712 --> 29:27.323
in alphabetical order,
very methodical, practical?

29:27.323 --> 29:29.632
Yes.

29:29.632 --> 29:32.059
I like order.

29:32.059 --> 29:35.515
Without it, without instruction,
I...

29:35.515 --> 29:37.563
..get rather lost.

29:37.563 --> 29:41.211
Would you remember this person?

29:41.211 --> 29:42.299
I don't know.

29:42.299 --> 29:45.883
I have such terrible blanknesses.

29:45.883 --> 29:48.571
Sometimes faces go,

29:48.571 --> 29:54.715
I wake up in places, and I
can't remember how I got there.

29:54.715 --> 29:58.363
Sometimes there is blood...

29:58.363 --> 30:02.779
..on me.

30:02.779 --> 30:07.259
There was the knife...

30:07.259 --> 30:13.723
..and all those dead people.

30:13.723 --> 30:16.539
I don't want to be a monster.

30:16.539 --> 30:28.763
You're not, Monsieur.

30:28.763 --> 30:31.792
I'm going back on the last train
to be with Hermione.

30:31.792 --> 30:34.792
She's so weak,
but she wanted me to thank you.

30:34.792 --> 30:39.712
I'm sure she does.

30:39.712 --> 30:41.755
She always used to say to Carmichael

30:41.755 --> 30:46.619
that you were the best birthday
present he ever gave her. True.

30:46.619 --> 30:51.232
After that party, if there was
a treat or even if she just wanted

30:51.232 --> 30:54.619
to get someone's attention,
she would use your phrase.

30:54.619 --> 30:59.419
"Mes enfants," she'd say,
and clap her hands.

30:59.419 --> 31:01.851
Where did that come from,
that phrase, "Mes enfants"?

31:01.851 --> 31:03.643
"My children," why that?

31:03.643 --> 31:08.152
Merely a verbal flourish.

31:08.152 --> 31:10.363
People found it entertaining,

31:10.363 --> 31:13.499
and when you are a stranger
in a strange land,

31:13.499 --> 31:15.291
it helps to be entertaining.

31:15.291 --> 31:21.179
Yes, I can only imagine.

31:21.179 --> 31:23.803
You're looking better.

31:23.803 --> 31:25.432
I hope you don't mind me saying

31:25.432 --> 31:30.232
but I was rather concerned
for you before.

31:30.232 --> 31:32.763
Yes, I'm feeling well.

31:32.763 --> 31:34.043
Good.

31:34.043 --> 31:39.099
My brother always said that
every man needs a purpose.

31:39.099 --> 31:40.251
GLASSES CLINK LOUDLY

31:40.251 --> 31:43.963
You have yours, and I...

31:43.963 --> 31:46.331
Well, I think I've just found mine.

31:46.331 --> 31:49.723
I'm going to be a husband.

31:49.723 --> 31:53.499
Miss Grey?
Yes.

31:53.499 --> 31:56.891
I'm very much in love with her.
Well, more than in love.

31:56.891 --> 32:00.155
I'm utterly enthralled.

32:00.155 --> 32:03.163
When this is all over,
I'm going to pop the question.

32:03.163 --> 32:05.467
Of course, she might not say yes.

32:05.467 --> 32:07.072
I am certain she will.

32:07.072 --> 32:08.872
I do hope you're right.

32:08.872 --> 32:20.699
I'll be a broken man if she doesn't.

32:20.699 --> 32:22.312
Thank you so much for enabling me

32:22.312 --> 32:25.691
to tell Hermione that ABC
has been caught.

32:25.691 --> 32:28.123
That Carmichael and the others
would have justice.

32:28.123 --> 32:30.235
I had no choice.

32:30.235 --> 32:32.219
I was bound.

32:32.219 --> 32:45.472
I gave my word to the dead.

32:45.472 --> 32:47.272
DOORS CLICK

32:47.272 --> 32:54.555
LIFT DESCENDS

32:54.555 --> 33:04.552
ETHEREAL VOICE:I was rather
concerned for you.

33:04.552 --> 33:20.539
TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS

33:20.539 --> 33:41.083
SHE SETS KEYS DOWN

33:41.083 --> 33:49.851
I found it in your wardrobe.

33:49.851 --> 34:01.819
What do you want?

34:01.819 --> 34:29.467
CARRIAGE DOOR OPENS

34:29.467 --> 34:32.155
Prove that I knew.

34:32.155 --> 34:41.179
Prove that I covered for Franklin.

34:41.179 --> 34:48.475
You can't.

34:48.475 --> 34:50.395
Well, then...

34:50.395 --> 34:53.211
..kindly leave.

34:53.211 --> 35:03.387
I'm an innocent woman,
and I wish to get changed.

35:03.387 --> 35:05.307
Where are my clothes?!

35:05.307 --> 35:08.272
Your hotel bill
has not been settled.

35:08.272 --> 35:11.579
None of the bills for your dresses,
your hats,

35:11.579 --> 35:13.755
your shoes, have been settled.

35:13.755 --> 35:16.955
Franklin has no money
until Lady Hermione dies.

35:16.955 --> 35:22.672
She is still living. Just.

35:22.672 --> 35:39.611
My furs, my furs, no, no, no,
that's mine! That's mine!

35:39.611 --> 35:41.659
He would have killed you as well.

35:41.659 --> 35:51.387
You know that really.

35:51.387 --> 36:02.459
Don't you pity me.

36:02.459 --> 36:04.315
SHE OPENS DOOR

36:04.315 --> 36:30.299
DOOR SLAMS SHUT

36:30.299 --> 36:34.971
Franklin's fingerprints match
the unknown ones on the typewriter.

36:34.971 --> 36:41.499
The artifice in the letters
was ventriloquism.

36:41.499 --> 36:46.171
Monsieur Cust was being worked.

36:46.171 --> 36:54.491
Words put into his mouth.

36:54.491 --> 36:56.923
I used to make a living at this.

36:56.923 --> 36:59.355
Well, then, you need
a new living, my friend.

36:59.355 --> 37:01.019
It's hard.

37:01.019 --> 37:04.603
You need someone to recommend you,
and I don't know anyone.

37:04.603 --> 37:06.651
Well, you know me now.

37:06.651 --> 37:12.539
Got some friends in sales, and I'm
going to do you a favour, Mr Cust.

37:12.539 --> 37:14.843
Sometimes the stars align.

37:14.843 --> 37:39.803
Chin-chin.

37:39.803 --> 37:42.619
I'm sick of these hazards
in my vestibule.

37:42.619 --> 37:46.715
Let me carry them up
for you, madam.

37:46.715 --> 38:01.499
This way, is it?

38:01.499 --> 38:07.003
Franklin?

38:07.003 --> 38:25.072
SHE GASPS

38:25.072 --> 38:29.152
If you want to stay alive...

38:29.152 --> 38:37.403
..sh.

38:37.403 --> 38:39.835
TELEPHONE RINGS

38:39.835 --> 38:43.419
Churston, 9-6-6.

38:43.419 --> 38:47.032
Darling, can you ask Car
to come to the telephone?

38:47.032 --> 38:50.032
I was in the bath.
Is there something wrong?

38:50.032 --> 38:52.912
WOMAN CRIES

38:52.912 --> 38:55.131
Come on now, I'm sorry, don't cry.

38:55.131 --> 38:56.872
I shouldn't have shouted at you.

38:56.872 --> 38:58.587
I'm sorry.

38:58.587 --> 38:59.803
Come here.

38:59.803 --> 39:02.683
Come on, now, don't cry.

39:02.683 --> 39:04.923
Keep going.
He's still out there listening.

39:04.923 --> 39:06.523
Keep going.

39:06.523 --> 39:10.619
SHE CRIES

39:10.619 --> 39:13.435
Why aren't you on the train,
you fucking idiot?

39:13.435 --> 39:18.619
Someone there.
Can you help me, please?

39:18.619 --> 39:27.259
Please. Help me.

39:27.259 --> 39:29.512
Sometimes, Alexander Bonaparte Cust,

39:29.512 --> 39:33.403
the stars align.

39:33.403 --> 39:36.411
And you are outliving your
usefulness.

39:36.411 --> 39:39.675
CUST CONTINUES CONVULSING ON FLOOR

39:39.675 --> 39:54.352
Chin-chin.

39:54.352 --> 39:56.635
What were you?

39:56.635 --> 39:58.491
Before?

39:58.491 --> 40:10.331
If not a policeman, then what?

40:10.331 --> 40:12.955
HE SIGHS

40:12.955 --> 40:15.195
That's a foolish headline.

40:15.195 --> 40:18.011
"Of a new and cruel age."

40:18.011 --> 40:23.131
Such vapid nostalgia
for the gentle past.

40:23.131 --> 40:49.755
Cruelty is not new.

40:49.755 --> 40:52.251
Well, we were going to get married
anyway, weren't we?

40:52.251 --> 40:53.787
I know you're still keen.

40:53.787 --> 40:56.859
We've both talked it over,
and it's the best idea,

40:56.859 --> 41:01.147
and then I get to keep
Donald in the family.

41:01.147 --> 41:05.632
You're stood there like a goldfish.
You're going to be Mrs Fraser!

41:05.632 --> 41:18.171
I'll get the sherry!

41:18.171 --> 41:21.179
I did you a favour.

41:21.179 --> 42:02.459
One day, you'll work that out.

42:02.459 --> 42:18.651
Excuse me, could I trouble you
for a light?

42:18.651 --> 42:20.763
Thank you very much.

42:20.763 --> 42:22.555
You're very welcome.

42:22.555 --> 42:28.123
It's awful cold this evening,
isn't it?Yes.

42:28.123 --> 42:32.283
Lily.

42:32.283 --> 42:37.403
Lily!

42:37.403 --> 42:40.219
Lily!

42:40.219 --> 42:43.312
Lily!

42:43.312 --> 42:52.379
SHE CRIES

42:52.379 --> 42:56.603
LILY!

42:56.603 --> 43:00.123
He might not wake up, you know.

43:00.123 --> 43:01.672
But, then again, he might.

43:01.672 --> 43:04.027
And then he'll want
to see a face he knows.

43:04.027 --> 43:41.152
So, I'll wait here,
if it's all the same to you.

43:41.152 --> 43:44.219
REPORTERS SHOUT OVER EACH OTHER

43:44.219 --> 43:48.059
Shame on yourself!
How do you sleep at night?

43:48.059 --> 43:49.275
Hang him!

43:49.275 --> 43:58.043
SHOUTING CONTINUES

43:58.043 --> 44:15.592
All right, that's enough! All right!

44:15.592 --> 44:17.435
GUNSHOT

44:17.435 --> 44:52.251
THEY SCREAM

44:52.251 --> 45:03.963
THEY GASP

45:03.963 --> 45:43.387
DOOR CLOSES

45:43.387 --> 46:08.411
GUNSHOT

46:08.411 --> 46:15.579
WHITE NOISE

46:15.579 --> 46:17.819
WHITE NOISE BECOMES SOUND OF FIRE

46:17.819 --> 46:21.851
GLASS BREAKS

46:21.851 --> 47:22.651
HE SIGHS

47:22.651 --> 47:35.323
INTERNAL VOICE: Assassin.

47:35.323 --> 47:37.371
KEYS TURN HEAVY LOCK

47:37.371 --> 48:06.875
PRISON DOOR OPENS

48:06.875 --> 48:09.243
What a treat.

48:09.243 --> 48:13.979
You've gone to so much trouble.

48:13.979 --> 48:20.571
Thank you.

48:20.571 --> 48:28.251
CLARKE CHUCKLES

48:28.251 --> 48:33.179
That bloody brandy glass, eh?

48:33.179 --> 48:34.843
That's what did it for me, isn't it?

48:34.843 --> 48:41.883
My fingerprints,
on the brandy glass.

48:41.883 --> 48:44.891
The moral of the story being...

48:44.891 --> 48:47.643
..never have a drink
with Hercule Poirot.

48:47.643 --> 48:51.675
You're having one now.

48:51.675 --> 48:56.923
Yes.

48:56.923 --> 49:00.891
Chin-chin.

49:00.891 --> 49:04.731
HE SLURPS GENTLY

49:04.731 --> 49:09.275
All that time you were looking for
enemies, for someone who hated you,

49:09.275 --> 49:12.731
you never thought to look
for a friend,

49:12.731 --> 49:16.699
for someone who loved you.

49:16.699 --> 49:19.131
I doubt you know
the meaning of the word...

49:19.131 --> 49:22.651
No, that's not true.

49:22.651 --> 49:25.979
I adored Hermione.

49:25.979 --> 49:28.155
And Carmichael.

49:28.155 --> 49:31.355
You killed him for his title
and his money.

49:31.355 --> 49:33.403
Well, yes, there is that.

49:33.403 --> 49:37.435
And you killed Alice Ascher
and Betty Barnard

49:37.435 --> 49:39.112
to distract from his murder.

49:39.112 --> 49:40.912
Doncaster was another distraction.

49:40.912 --> 49:44.283
Doncaster, what a cock-up.

49:44.283 --> 49:46.203
If that had gone right,
I could have stopped.

49:46.203 --> 49:52.091
No, you couldn't.

49:52.091 --> 49:57.723
No, I couldn't. You're right.

49:57.723 --> 50:02.139
I got such a taste for it by then.

50:02.139 --> 50:05.083
So bloody exciting.

50:05.083 --> 50:08.219
Not the murders so much, no,
they were appallingly messy.

50:08.219 --> 50:10.971
No, it was you.

50:10.971 --> 50:16.552
I never felt so completely alive...

50:16.552 --> 50:21.979
..than when you were chasing me.

50:21.979 --> 50:23.707
Knowing I was restoring you.

50:23.707 --> 50:25.627
I did not need to be restored.

50:25.627 --> 50:28.251
Oh, come on. You were ruined.

50:28.251 --> 50:30.939
You were disgraced,

50:30.939 --> 50:35.547
derided and reviled,
and I thought...

50:35.547 --> 50:39.131
..not on my watch.

50:39.131 --> 50:41.819
And the moment I saw
Cust's initials,

50:41.819 --> 50:47.963
the whole adventure came together,
and I thought how you'd love it.

50:47.963 --> 50:50.523
Of course, it took a lot
of organisation and detective work,

50:50.523 --> 50:52.571
but it was worth it.

50:52.571 --> 50:55.963
Because look at you now, Hercule.

50:55.963 --> 51:00.763
Bright eyed and bushy tailed,
revived and...

51:00.763 --> 51:02.235
..restored.

51:02.235 --> 51:04.859
Franklin, five people are dead.

51:04.859 --> 51:07.163
Well, people die all the time,
don't they?

51:07.163 --> 51:12.283
And, really, it's your fault.

51:12.283 --> 51:13.947
How is it my fault?

51:13.947 --> 51:20.091
Hermione's birthday party.

51:20.091 --> 51:24.251
Those strange, little games.

51:24.251 --> 51:27.323
How to get away with murder...

51:27.323 --> 51:30.971
..the myriad ways to end a life.

51:30.971 --> 51:36.603
I was spellbound.

51:36.603 --> 51:40.123
I felt such kinship with you.

51:40.123 --> 51:42.555
That's why I chose the costume,
you see.

51:42.555 --> 51:45.627
The dark, the light,
the hunter, the hunted.

51:45.627 --> 51:51.899
Two hearts beating
the same hot blood.

51:51.899 --> 51:58.363
You and your strange enchantments,
Hercule.

51:58.363 --> 52:00.859
You didn't know the knife
you were sharpening.

52:00.859 --> 52:03.675
HE SLURPS GENTLY

52:03.675 --> 52:07.323
Franklin, I didn't
cast a spell on you.

52:07.323 --> 52:13.019
You were kindling,
lying in wait for a spark.

52:13.019 --> 52:16.091
I fear your soul is a charnel house.

52:16.091 --> 52:25.243
I grieve for you.

52:25.243 --> 52:30.619
I wanted so much
for you to admire me.

52:30.619 --> 52:35.803
To be a worthy adversary, someone
you could share your secrets with.

52:35.803 --> 52:43.483
I do not have secrets.
You lie!

52:43.483 --> 52:49.192
We're friends.

52:49.192 --> 52:51.611
What compels you, Hercule?

52:51.611 --> 52:53.723
Tell me.

52:53.723 --> 52:55.707
What drives you?

52:55.707 --> 52:57.179
Were you always like this?

52:57.179 --> 53:00.832
Is there another Hercule
that got left behind?

53:00.832 --> 53:06.651
What dead did you give your word to?

53:06.651 --> 53:10.619
That scar looks deep.
It must have hurt.

53:10.619 --> 53:14.779
How did you get it?

53:14.779 --> 53:21.499
Did it make you like this?

53:21.499 --> 53:24.379
Tell me.

53:24.379 --> 53:27.131
Tell me your secrets.

53:27.131 --> 53:32.443
I won't breathe a word.

53:32.443 --> 53:37.192
I won't be breathing at all.

53:37.192 --> 53:41.211
I gave you the breakfast
you requested.

53:41.211 --> 54:06.363
You get nothing else.

54:06.363 --> 54:31.515
As if prayers are going to make
the slightest difference.

54:31.515 --> 55:05.499
WHISPERS:You're going to miss me,
Hercule.

55:05.499 --> 55:07.552
KEY TURNS HEAVY LOCK

55:07.552 --> 55:14.587
PRISON DOOR OPENS

55:14.587 --> 55:27.963
DOOR OPENS

55:27.963 --> 55:29.883
TRAP DOOR OPENS
