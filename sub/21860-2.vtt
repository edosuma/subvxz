WEBVTT

00:21.438 --> 00:24.006
(Rodney and Sam grunting)

00:24.007 --> 00:26.242
(laughs)

00:26.243 --> 00:28.577
(both breathing heavily)

00:28.578 --> 00:31.547
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

00:31.548 --> 00:33.716
Oh, wow. Oh.

00:33.717 --> 00:37.253
Holy shit!
Whoo-hoo!

00:37.254 --> 00:39.155
(panting)

00:43.193 --> 00:44.927
Did you?

00:44.928 --> 00:46.195
What?

00:46.196 --> 00:49.531
Did you?
Did you... have an orgasm?

00:49.532 --> 00:51.300
Oh. Oh.

00:51.301 --> 00:54.403
Oh, that...
doesn't matter.

00:54.404 --> 00:57.373
Well, it matters to me.

00:57.374 --> 00:58.440
What?

00:58.441 --> 01:01.076
I'd like to know
that I satisfied you.

01:01.077 --> 01:02.244
Oh.

01:02.245 --> 01:05.381
(sighs)
That's okay.

01:05.382 --> 01:07.116
It's important to me.

01:07.117 --> 01:09.151
Well, here's a little way
you can look at it.

01:09.152 --> 01:12.821
If you ask a woman,
"Did you come?"

01:12.822 --> 01:15.424
and her answer is,
"It doesn't matter,"

01:15.425 --> 01:17.159
what do you think?

01:17.160 --> 01:18.327
Oh.

01:18.328 --> 01:20.930
Come on.

01:20.931 --> 01:22.564
We got to go to the thing.

01:22.565 --> 01:24.300
(grunts)

01:24.301 --> 01:25.969
Get dressed.

01:27.904 --> 01:29.939
Oh, I'm so hungry.

01:29.940 --> 01:30.940
Hungry.

01:32.809 --> 01:35.344
♪ Mother ♪

01:35.345 --> 01:39.114
♪ You had me ♪

01:39.115 --> 01:42.752
♪ But I never had you ♪

01:46.957 --> 01:50.727
♪ I wanted you ♪

01:52.462 --> 01:57.334
♪ You didn't want me. ♪

02:00.270 --> 02:03.940
Does this plug in,
so I can play mine?

02:09.279 --> 02:11.213
Why do you always do that?

02:11.214 --> 02:13.282
What?

02:13.283 --> 02:14.783
I like music.

02:14.784 --> 02:16.218
(scoffs)

02:16.219 --> 02:19.521
I like yours, too,
but I'm not...

02:19.522 --> 02:20.789
I don't.

02:20.790 --> 02:24.026
I mean you always
want to have sex

02:24.027 --> 02:26.363
before we go out.

02:28.465 --> 02:30.799
(scoffs)
You didn't want to?

02:30.800 --> 02:32.134
It's not that.

02:32.135 --> 02:34.636
We had to hurry.

02:34.637 --> 02:36.705
The thing starts soon.

02:36.706 --> 02:38.007
It's not...
you just...

02:38.008 --> 02:39.408
It's that you always do that.

02:39.409 --> 02:42.378
You always say,
"Let's have sex,"

02:42.379 --> 02:45.514
before we go places.

02:45.515 --> 02:47.916
What...

02:47.917 --> 02:50.386
What's the question?

02:50.387 --> 02:52.488
Why do you always do that?

02:52.489 --> 02:54.157
Ugh.

02:56.860 --> 02:59.862
Because...

02:59.863 --> 03:01.497
You know what happens?

03:01.498 --> 03:04.566
I just... I want to
get it out of the way.

03:04.567 --> 03:06.335
(quietly):
Yeah.

03:06.336 --> 03:07.770
Out of the way?

03:07.771 --> 03:10.506
Yeah. Yeah, I figure if we...

03:10.507 --> 03:13.643
if we do it, then we can
just go out after.

03:14.944 --> 03:17.013
Why, though?

03:19.215 --> 03:23.452
Because, after, I just
want to go home and...

03:23.453 --> 03:26.188
and I figure if I fuck you now,

03:26.189 --> 03:27.956
then you're not gonna
want me to come over

03:27.957 --> 03:30.092
and do a whole thing,
or you're not gonna want

03:30.093 --> 03:31.393
to come in my house.

03:31.394 --> 03:33.595
And this just gets it
out of the way,

03:33.596 --> 03:38.301
and then everybody can
just go home.

03:43.773 --> 03:49.045
So sex with me is
like a chore to you?

03:53.550 --> 03:56.418
Do you enjoy having sex with me?

03:56.419 --> 03:58.153
Oh, my God.

03:58.154 --> 04:00.122
Please don't ask
questions like that.

04:00.123 --> 04:02.124
Why do you ask
questions like that?

04:02.125 --> 04:03.659
There are no good answers.

04:03.660 --> 04:05.761
The only answers
to questions like that

04:05.762 --> 04:07.730
are lies and bad news.

04:10.333 --> 04:12.035
Oh.

04:13.670 --> 04:15.971
And Bing Crosby's
in his living room,

04:15.972 --> 04:17.406
and David Bowie walks in,

04:17.407 --> 04:19.141
and they start singing
"Little Drummer Boy."

04:19.142 --> 04:20.844
- Do you remember that?
- Yes, amazing.

04:20.847 --> 04:21.977
I love it.

04:21.978 --> 04:23.512
I-I never saw that.

04:23.513 --> 04:25.814
David Bowie and Bill Cosby?

04:25.815 --> 04:27.616
Bing Crosby.

04:27.617 --> 04:28.951
(laughs):
What? No...

04:28.952 --> 04:30.185
(laughter)

04:30.186 --> 04:31.453
I am so sorry.

04:31.454 --> 04:33.689
That's okay.

04:33.690 --> 04:35.525
- That would have been very different...
- You're young.

04:35.528 --> 04:38.260
If Bill Cosby sang
with David Bowie.

04:38.261 --> 04:40.496
(chuckles)

04:40.497 --> 04:42.831
So, do you guys have kids?

04:42.832 --> 04:43.999
No, no.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.435
Yeah. No, don't do that.

04:46.436 --> 04:48.537
Yeah, well, this is
a strange time

04:48.538 --> 04:51.273
to be bringing a child
into the world, isn't it?

04:51.274 --> 04:53.108
Well, we-we like
to travel.

04:53.109 --> 04:54.944
- That's our thing, so kids...
- Yeah.

04:54.947 --> 04:56.378
They put a damper on that.

04:56.379 --> 04:58.013
Where do you guys
like to travel?

04:58.014 --> 04:59.848
Oh, well, this weekend,
we're shooting up to Mammoth.

04:59.849 --> 05:01.283
You guys should
totally come with us.

05:01.284 --> 05:02.618
We're renting a
sweet little house.

05:02.619 --> 05:04.153
Oh, us?

05:04.154 --> 05:07.389
Oh, no, we're not together.

05:07.390 --> 05:09.625
You're not?

05:09.626 --> 05:10.894
Nope.

05:12.962 --> 05:14.797
We're not a thing.

05:16.966 --> 05:19.401
But that's so cool.
Is that your wedding ring?

05:19.402 --> 05:20.836
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:20.837 --> 05:22.471
Hey.

05:22.472 --> 05:24.540
Hey.

05:24.541 --> 05:26.141
Good night.

05:26.142 --> 05:27.843
Good night?

05:27.844 --> 05:29.678
What do you mean "good night"?
You're my ride home.

05:29.679 --> 05:30.914
No.

05:32.482 --> 05:34.750
We're not together, remember?

05:34.751 --> 05:36.218
We're not a thing.

05:36.219 --> 05:38.921
Oh, wait, are you mad?

05:38.922 --> 05:41.857
Why would I drive you home?

05:41.858 --> 05:44.860
Why would I spend
one more second with you

05:44.861 --> 05:46.328
the way you've acted towards me?

05:46.329 --> 05:48.830
The way you talk to me,

05:48.831 --> 05:50.432
the lack of respect,

05:50.433 --> 05:52.034
or ever

05:52.035 --> 05:54.069
trying to be nice to me...

05:54.070 --> 05:55.737
Like, I can't even remember

05:55.738 --> 05:59.074
even you saying
something nice to me.

05:59.075 --> 06:00.676
Uh, "It doesn't matter."

06:00.677 --> 06:02.744
"We're not a thing."

06:02.745 --> 06:04.680
"I didn't not like
having sex with you."

06:04.681 --> 06:07.015
I didn't say that last one.

06:07.016 --> 06:08.684
All you do is hurt people.

06:08.685 --> 06:10.786
Oh, wow.

06:10.787 --> 06:13.121
I... Look, I'm...

06:13.122 --> 06:15.891
sorry, but it's just...

06:15.892 --> 06:18.026
I feel like you keep testing me.

06:18.027 --> 06:22.464
Like you demand a certain level
of thing from me.

06:22.465 --> 06:26.468
All I ask for is
basic consideration.

06:26.469 --> 06:31.073
Like just common courtesy
would be nice.

06:31.074 --> 06:34.476
No, I don't think
that's accurate at all.

06:34.477 --> 06:37.546
I feel like
you demand a whole lot...

06:37.547 --> 06:38.580
Too much, frankly,

06:38.581 --> 06:41.283
considering
what you bring to the table.

06:41.284 --> 06:42.985
(chuckles):
Oh, really?

06:42.986 --> 06:45.387
Yeah. If you want
to know the truth,

06:45.388 --> 06:48.590
you need a lot,
and you give little.

06:48.591 --> 06:51.560
That is so insulting.

06:51.561 --> 06:52.961
Well, that may be true,

06:52.962 --> 06:55.897
but I think
you kind of have it coming.

06:55.898 --> 06:57.566
(scoffs)
You are so mean.

06:57.567 --> 06:59.268
Oh, my God, fine.

06:59.269 --> 07:01.570
Okay, I'm mean.

07:01.571 --> 07:03.972
Jesus Christ,
why does everybody have to be

07:03.973 --> 07:06.575
so careful all the time
with a man's feelings?

07:06.576 --> 07:08.310
"Ooh, don't hurt the man.

07:08.311 --> 07:10.679
His feelings are so important."

07:10.680 --> 07:12.848
You guys are
supposed to be tough.

07:12.849 --> 07:14.416
You're such pussies.

07:14.417 --> 07:16.852
The second a woman

07:16.853 --> 07:19.021
is a tiny bit mean to a man

07:19.022 --> 07:23.358
or even just a tiny bit honest,
she's a bitch.

07:23.359 --> 07:25.761
I don't use that word. Come on.

07:25.762 --> 07:26.795
Well, you should start.

07:26.796 --> 07:28.263
If you curse once in a while,

07:28.264 --> 07:30.365
it might make you
a little bit sexy.

07:30.366 --> 07:34.469
You talk like you play fucking
first violin at the choir thing.

07:34.470 --> 07:35.971
(laughs)

07:35.972 --> 07:40.008
I'm sorry if I'm not
the Marlboro Man.

07:40.009 --> 07:41.376
No, you're really not.

07:41.377 --> 07:45.447
And yet, you demand to know,
"Did I make you come?

07:45.448 --> 07:47.115
"Do you like me?

07:47.116 --> 07:48.884
Do you like
having sex with me?"

07:48.885 --> 07:52.054
Jesus Christ, she is
so high maintenance, this one.

07:52.055 --> 07:54.323
I mean, don't ask things

07:54.324 --> 07:56.291
if you don't want to know
the real answers.

07:56.292 --> 07:58.293
All I want to know is

07:58.294 --> 07:59.995
what you feel about me.

07:59.996 --> 08:02.898
You want to know
how I feel about you?

08:02.899 --> 08:05.634
Boo. Boo on you.

08:05.635 --> 08:07.235
Bad job.

08:07.236 --> 08:08.537
Bad job.

08:08.538 --> 08:11.640
You're no fun.
You're no fun.

08:11.641 --> 08:14.042
Oh, God!

08:14.043 --> 08:17.512
I've hated you since the first
minute of our first date.

08:17.513 --> 08:21.183
And I've been dating you
for three weeks.

08:21.184 --> 08:22.984
That is how nice I am!

08:22.985 --> 08:24.486
If I had been

08:24.487 --> 08:26.922
really honest,
I would've said, "Nope,"

08:26.923 --> 08:29.691
the second I met your face.

08:29.692 --> 08:31.226
Look at that.

08:31.227 --> 08:34.396
And yet, how many times
have I had sex with you?

08:34.397 --> 08:36.365
Like, ten times!

08:36.366 --> 08:37.999
That is how nice I am!

08:38.000 --> 08:39.568
Do you want to know why?

08:39.569 --> 08:42.070
Because I'm nice!

08:42.071 --> 08:44.272
Because you suck.

08:44.273 --> 08:46.074
And I hang out with you.

08:46.075 --> 08:48.243
(groans)

08:48.244 --> 08:50.078
We had sex before we came here,

08:50.079 --> 08:52.514
and now she's like,
"Did I satisfy you?

08:52.515 --> 08:53.915
Did I make you come?"

08:53.916 --> 08:55.250
Oh, my God.

08:55.251 --> 08:58.754
Like, how many ways do I have to
take care of this woman?

08:58.755 --> 09:01.390
And now, she's not
driving me home.

09:01.391 --> 09:02.591
And...

09:02.592 --> 09:04.025
I sucked her dick.

09:04.026 --> 09:05.794
Because I wasn't wet, at all.

09:05.795 --> 09:07.696
Otherwise, it wouldn't have
gotten in there.

09:07.697 --> 09:11.434
I mean, that's how nice I am.

09:14.437 --> 09:16.138
Thank you.

09:16.139 --> 09:18.940
Oh... well.

09:18.941 --> 09:20.909
(voice breaking):
Thanks so much.

09:20.910 --> 09:23.145
Oh. You're welcome.

09:23.146 --> 09:25.881
I seriously, I should
get the Nobel Prize.

09:25.882 --> 09:27.183
Yeah. You...

09:27.184 --> 09:28.483
Because you are a bummer.

09:28.484 --> 09:30.386
- Thank you. Okay.
- Boo.

09:30.389 --> 09:32.121
- Thank you. - Boo on you.
- (engine starts)

09:32.124 --> 09:33.588
Thank you.

09:33.589 --> 09:34.823
All right.

09:34.824 --> 09:36.324
Bye-bye.

09:36.325 --> 09:37.559
Good night.

09:37.560 --> 09:38.727
That's cool.

09:38.728 --> 09:40.562
I'll get an Uber.

09:40.563 --> 09:42.798
Thank God for Uber.

09:42.799 --> 09:46.568
This breakup brought to you
by Uber!

09:46.569 --> 09:48.069
Good night!

09:48.070 --> 09:50.505
Good night, baby doll!

09:50.506 --> 09:52.041
(groaning)

09:56.179 --> 09:57.345
(exhales)

09:57.346 --> 09:58.681
Dick.

10:02.560 --> 10:04.899
How come we don't have an English
accent like Nan?

10:05.520 --> 10:07.989
Well, because we didn't
grow up in England, honey.

10:07.990 --> 10:11.993
You get an accent from
years of living in a place.

10:11.994 --> 10:13.661
Yeah, but Nan's lived here

10:13.662 --> 10:15.363
way longer than
she's lived in England,

10:15.364 --> 10:16.998
so how come she has an accent?

10:16.999 --> 10:20.134
(chuckles) Well,
that's true, honey,

10:20.135 --> 10:23.304
but Nan doesn't always
notice where she is.

10:23.305 --> 10:25.473
You mean because she's elderly?

10:25.474 --> 10:28.075
Yeah, that's part of it.

10:28.076 --> 10:29.744
But, you know, Phil is very...

10:29.745 --> 10:32.346
Do you think
she's gonna die soon?

10:32.347 --> 10:33.347
What?

10:33.348 --> 10:36.817
Is she...
gonna die soon?

10:36.818 --> 10:39.587
Honey, why are you
thinking about that?

10:39.588 --> 10:41.822
You don't have to
worry about that.

10:41.823 --> 10:44.091
Because she talks
about it all the time.

10:44.092 --> 10:46.861
Yesterday, she told me I have to
promise I'm gonna miss her.

10:46.862 --> 10:50.064
Jesus, Duke, I'm telling you,

10:50.065 --> 10:52.400
that lady is gonna bury us all.

10:52.401 --> 10:53.567
Really?

10:53.568 --> 10:54.769
Yes.

10:54.770 --> 10:56.103
I'm telling you right now,

10:56.104 --> 11:00.107
your grandmother will never die.

11:00.108 --> 11:01.610
(sighs)

11:05.847 --> 11:07.948
When do you come back?

11:07.949 --> 11:10.418
I told you, honey,
it's just two nights.

11:10.419 --> 11:12.386
So Monday after school?

11:12.387 --> 11:15.022
Yeah, on Monday,
Unky Jeff is gonna

11:15.023 --> 11:16.724
take you and Sorrow to school,

11:16.725 --> 11:18.726
and then I'm gonna
pick you up after.

11:18.727 --> 11:20.628
Okay?

11:20.629 --> 11:21.629
(kisses)

11:21.630 --> 11:22.930
Gonna be fun.

11:22.931 --> 11:24.866
- Knock, knock.
- (Duke gasps)

11:24.869 --> 11:26.067
SORROW:
Come out back!

11:26.068 --> 11:27.134
We got a trampoline!

11:27.135 --> 11:28.202
Oh...

11:28.203 --> 11:30.105
- Duke!
- (giggling)

11:34.476 --> 11:35.876
Uh...

11:35.877 --> 11:37.244
Are you good? Come here.

11:37.245 --> 11:39.213
Thanks.

11:39.214 --> 11:42.917
Thanks.
Thanks.

11:42.918 --> 11:43.951
(sighs)

11:43.952 --> 11:45.753
So, you okay?

11:45.754 --> 11:47.421
Yeah. I mean,
everything's kind of weird

11:47.422 --> 11:48.989
right now, you know.

11:48.990 --> 11:52.993
I'm sitting for my kid
in Sunny's house,

11:52.994 --> 11:54.829
while she goes off
to Santa Barbara

11:54.830 --> 11:56.230
with her new rich boyfriend.

11:56.231 --> 11:59.433
That's kind of a kick
in the left nut.

11:59.434 --> 12:00.469
Yeah.

12:00.470 --> 12:01.502
Yeah.

12:01.503 --> 12:02.636
Well, you kind of...

12:02.637 --> 12:04.004
Made my bed? Yeah.

12:04.005 --> 12:05.439
I did. I built it.

12:05.440 --> 12:07.274
And then I made it,
and then I pissed in it,

12:07.275 --> 12:10.344
then I took a big,
tasty shit in it,

12:10.345 --> 12:13.280
and... now it's mine
to sleep in.

12:13.281 --> 12:14.583
- So...
- Yep.

12:14.586 --> 12:15.784
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

12:15.785 --> 12:16.785
You know what would help?

12:16.786 --> 12:17.918
If everyone didn't
hate me so much.

12:17.919 --> 12:18.919
(clears throat)

12:18.920 --> 12:20.354
I don't hate you.

12:20.355 --> 12:22.590
No, I hated you
when you were married to Sunny

12:22.591 --> 12:24.325
because you were hurting her.

12:24.326 --> 12:27.529
And now you're not,
so now I just wish you well.

12:28.663 --> 12:30.598
You mean that?

12:30.599 --> 12:32.600
Yeah. Yeah, I mean it.

12:32.601 --> 12:34.602
And I'm trusting you
with my daughter

12:34.603 --> 12:36.837
so I could go visit your ex-wife

12:36.838 --> 12:39.540
at her new rich boyfriend's
house in Santa Barbara.

12:39.541 --> 12:40.941
Yeah, yeah.

12:40.942 --> 12:43.477
(clears throat)

12:43.478 --> 12:46.547
Seriously, though, buddy,
I think this is good.

12:46.548 --> 12:48.215
You can get your shit together.

12:48.216 --> 12:50.050
You got some great in you
somewhere.

12:50.051 --> 12:52.187
I... feel like.

12:53.555 --> 12:56.023
Mm, yeah.

12:56.024 --> 12:58.292
Yeah...

12:58.293 --> 13:01.228
I doubt it.

13:01.229 --> 13:04.832
But I understand what you mean.

13:04.833 --> 13:07.668
Rock bottom.

13:07.669 --> 13:09.904
(groans)

13:09.905 --> 13:11.572
Feels pretty sweet.

13:11.573 --> 13:14.442
Pretty sweet.

13:16.845 --> 13:18.979
Okay.

13:18.980 --> 13:20.381
Sammy, have fun.

13:20.382 --> 13:21.383
Okay. See you.

13:21.384 --> 13:22.384
All right.

13:22.385 --> 13:25.886
Okay, guys. (claps)
Let's do this! Here we go.

13:25.887 --> 13:27.154
Bye, Mama!
I love you!

13:27.155 --> 13:28.355
Bye!

13:28.356 --> 13:30.090
Bye, guys.

13:30.091 --> 13:31.325
All right.

13:31.326 --> 13:33.360
Let's do a little bit of that!

13:33.361 --> 13:34.563
- All right.
- Okay.

13:34.566 --> 13:36.764
DUKE:
Okay, can you do this?

13:36.765 --> 13:38.567
JEFF:
Oh, goodness, no.

13:43.888 --> 13:45.422
SAM:
Frankie,

13:45.423 --> 13:48.325
I just need you to stay
with Bottle for two days.

13:48.326 --> 13:50.594
Bottle's parents don't allow
Internet in the house.

13:50.595 --> 13:52.396
So? That's good.

13:52.397 --> 13:54.765
No, Mom, I need the Internet
to do my homework.

13:54.766 --> 13:55.833
Frankie,

13:55.834 --> 13:57.735
I hate when you use homework

13:57.736 --> 13:59.670
as an excuse
to not do something.

13:59.671 --> 14:01.205
Can't I just stay in our house?

14:01.206 --> 14:02.272
No, miss.

14:02.273 --> 14:04.341
You and your sister gave that up
with the party

14:04.342 --> 14:06.677
and the damage you've done
to my home.

14:06.678 --> 14:09.279
Thank you so much, Samuel.
Love you so much, too.

14:09.280 --> 14:10.948
Oh, you're welcome.

14:10.949 --> 14:12.116
Hi!

14:12.117 --> 14:13.217
WOMEN:
Hi!

14:13.218 --> 14:14.952
Why, thank you.

14:14.953 --> 14:16.387
(whoops)

14:16.388 --> 14:18.056
- Yes, it's so fun.
- Welcome aboard.

14:18.059 --> 14:19.390
It's gonna be good.

14:19.391 --> 14:21.292
(quiet chatter)

14:23.628 --> 14:25.295
Ladies, welcome aboard.

14:25.296 --> 14:26.864
Here we go.

14:26.865 --> 14:28.767
(quiet chatter continues)

14:30.702 --> 14:32.103
- Welcome aboard.
- Hello, Captain, my captain!

14:32.106 --> 14:34.938
How's everything going today?

14:34.939 --> 14:36.473
Oh, my God.

14:36.474 --> 14:38.709
I feel like I was
meant to be here.

14:38.710 --> 14:40.377
To all my friends!

14:40.378 --> 14:41.879
Thank you, Captain.

14:41.880 --> 14:43.147
We need you, too, right?

14:43.148 --> 14:44.416
- You're coming?
- PILOT: Yes, ma'am.

14:44.419 --> 14:46.284
- SAM: Okay, thank God.
- Yeah, but he can't drink.

14:46.287 --> 14:47.751
This is so hot!

14:47.752 --> 14:49.254
- So excited.
- (laughs)

14:49.257 --> 14:50.320
Yes.

14:50.321 --> 14:51.889
Poppin' botties.

14:51.890 --> 14:53.991
Look at you on a plane.

14:53.992 --> 14:55.325
(singsongy):
Weekend away.

14:55.326 --> 14:58.062
You know,
I could get used to this.

14:58.063 --> 14:59.231
Mace, drink something.

14:59.232 --> 15:00.397
Mace, come on.

15:00.398 --> 15:02.800
(phone vibrating)

15:02.801 --> 15:04.601
(Sam sighs)

15:04.602 --> 15:06.270
Hello? What?

15:06.271 --> 15:09.006
Mom, Bottle just told me
they're fasting this weekend.

15:09.007 --> 15:11.475
They're not even
going to feed me.

15:11.476 --> 15:14.445
Please, just let me stay
in my own house.

15:14.446 --> 15:15.779
Frankie, give me a break.

15:15.780 --> 15:17.247
I had to find someplace

15:17.248 --> 15:19.116
to put all you guys
for the weekend, okay?

15:19.117 --> 15:21.085
I'm on the plane.
I'll call you when we land.

15:21.086 --> 15:22.520
- Is that Frankie?
- Yes. Sorry.

15:22.523 --> 15:24.322
- Give me the phone. Gimme, gimme, gimme.
- Oh, boy.

15:24.325 --> 15:25.957
- Okay. All right.
- Yes.

15:25.960 --> 15:28.425
Hey, Frankie.
It's Aunt Sun.

15:28.426 --> 15:31.495
Listen, your mom's
on a trip now, okay?

15:31.496 --> 15:33.330
She is officially on a trip,

15:33.331 --> 15:35.165
so you can't talk
to her anymore.

15:35.166 --> 15:37.868
So just be a big girl,

15:37.869 --> 15:39.837
and put your big boy pants on,

15:39.838 --> 15:41.907
and figure your stuff out, okay?

15:41.908 --> 15:43.974
(chuckling)

15:43.975 --> 15:46.376
Okay. Love you. Thank you.

15:46.377 --> 15:47.978
(chuckling):
Oh, my God.

15:47.979 --> 15:49.380
- Nice.
- Well done.

15:49.383 --> 15:51.048
Two days without kids.

15:51.049 --> 15:52.883
ALL:
Yes!

15:52.884 --> 15:54.118
(engine whirring)

15:54.119 --> 15:55.486
SAM:
Drinks and champagne...

15:55.487 --> 15:56.488
(plane rumbles)

15:56.489 --> 15:57.489
Okay, I can't!

15:57.490 --> 15:59.823
Okay, guys, this guy... this
isn't gonna go up in the air.

15:59.824 --> 16:01.959
I swear to God, if it is,
I'm going with it.

16:01.960 --> 16:03.393
Mace! No, no, no,
look at me.

16:03.394 --> 16:04.462
No, seriously. I'm not...

16:04.463 --> 16:05.529
Calm your tits.

16:05.530 --> 16:06.748
I really don't want to do it!

16:06.749 --> 16:07.965
Calm your tits. Mace, Mace!

16:07.966 --> 16:09.967
(all talking over each other)

16:09.968 --> 16:11.668
PILOT:
Everything okay back there?

16:11.669 --> 16:13.070
We're fine.
We're fine.

16:13.071 --> 16:14.872
Open the door and let her out.

16:14.873 --> 16:16.306
Open the freaking door
and let her out.

16:16.307 --> 16:17.808
I'm gonna actually drive there.

16:17.809 --> 16:19.910
PILOT:
Should we head back?

16:19.911 --> 16:21.378
MACY: You know
what would be really nice?

16:21.379 --> 16:23.480
Is if everyone actually
stopped pacifying me.

16:23.481 --> 16:26.350
SAM:
Wait, Macy. Seriously?

16:26.351 --> 16:28.352
SUNNY: Mace, honey,
honey, come on.

16:28.353 --> 16:30.021
- SAM: Oh, are you okay?
- Yeah.

16:30.024 --> 16:31.823
- Don't hit your head.
- I'll see you there.

16:31.826 --> 16:34.025
- I... Okay.
- SUNNY: More champagne for us.

16:34.028 --> 16:36.093
I'll see you there.

16:36.094 --> 16:38.495
(Macy panting)

16:38.496 --> 16:40.398
- SAM: I love you.
- (coughing)

16:46.070 --> 16:47.737
When you get to name your home.

16:47.738 --> 16:50.707
Sunny, your boyfriend
is stupid rich.

16:50.708 --> 16:55.211
My home is called "House Full
of Tiny Assholes with Vaginas."

16:55.212 --> 16:56.681
- (laughs)
- Hey, guys, seriously, though,

16:56.682 --> 16:58.581
Don't make bitchy comments
about how rich he is

16:58.582 --> 16:59.916
every two seconds.

16:59.917 --> 17:02.052
Oh, no, he brought
us here on a jet

17:02.053 --> 17:03.753
because he's really
very down-to-earth.

17:03.754 --> 17:05.221
I don't want him to feel weird.

17:05.222 --> 17:07.424
Honey, he's weird.
Look at this place.

17:07.425 --> 17:09.326
(playing mariachi music)

17:15.099 --> 17:17.059
(men singing in Spanish,
women chattering quietly)

17:20.438 --> 17:22.405
MARK:
Welcome!

17:22.406 --> 17:26.543
Welcome, welcome.
The long wait is over!

17:26.544 --> 17:28.079
- My sunshine.
- Hi. Okay, um...

17:28.082 --> 17:29.913
(both moaning)

17:29.914 --> 17:31.182
MARK: Wow. That was worth it.

17:31.183 --> 17:32.449
(Sunny giggles)

17:32.450 --> 17:34.084
Mm. (kisses)

17:34.085 --> 17:35.886
- I love it.
- SUNNY: Tressa, are you taking a picture?

17:35.889 --> 17:37.320
Sounds so good.

17:37.321 --> 17:38.823
- SUNNY: You're hilarious.
- Yes.

17:38.826 --> 17:40.157
- Of course I am.
- MARK: Oh, that's funny.

17:40.160 --> 17:41.492
- SUNNY: Oh, my God. - Hello. Hi.
- MARK: Hi.

17:41.495 --> 17:43.294
- This is Tressa.
- It's a real pleasure.

17:43.297 --> 17:44.995
- And Fancy. - Hi.
- Hi. Fancy.

17:44.998 --> 17:46.563
Fancy.
Thank you for coming.

17:46.564 --> 17:48.099
- Thanks so much.
- Oh, sure, yeah.

17:48.102 --> 17:49.500
- Sam.
- Hi, Mark.

17:49.503 --> 17:50.585
Okay. Yeah.

17:50.586 --> 17:51.668
Oh. All right.

17:51.669 --> 17:53.503
Well, let's work our way in.
Please. Please.

17:53.504 --> 17:55.439
- TRESSA: Of course.
- There is so much to do this weekend.

17:55.442 --> 17:57.141
- Ooh, are these new flowers?
- Food and drink to eat.

17:57.144 --> 18:00.344
- I love those.
- And I just, I recently renamed the house to Casa Sunny.

18:00.347 --> 18:01.979
- Just, let me...
- Oh. Wow.

18:01.982 --> 18:04.147
Make some introductions
here quickly.

18:04.148 --> 18:06.349
All right.
Not much better looking than me,

18:06.350 --> 18:08.852
my brother Charles
and his lovely wife Elize.

18:08.853 --> 18:10.086
ELIZE:
Hi.

18:10.087 --> 18:11.488
MARK:
These two gentlemen back here,

18:11.489 --> 18:12.856
they tutor me in math.

18:12.857 --> 18:14.290
(laughter)

18:14.291 --> 18:17.026
You, I would like you
to meet somebody.

18:17.027 --> 18:19.630
- Okay.
- Just for a second, just meet a friend of mine.

18:19.633 --> 18:20.898
O... kay.

18:20.899 --> 18:22.166
Sam, this is Dalton.

18:24.268 --> 18:25.269
Uh...

18:27.371 --> 18:28.705
Oh, you know what?

18:28.706 --> 18:32.175
Actually,
I have to be right back.

18:32.176 --> 18:33.209
Right back.

18:33.210 --> 18:34.811
SUNNY:
Sam, honey, what...?

18:34.812 --> 18:37.547
One sec, Sun, because I think
I forgot something

18:37.548 --> 18:38.949
- in the-the golf cart thing.
- Wait, Sammy...

18:38.952 --> 18:40.517
Hi.
