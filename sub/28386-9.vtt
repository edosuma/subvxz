00:00.100 --> 00:01.535
<i>Previously, on "The Bold Type"...</i>

00:01.619 --> 00:03.316
<i>I'm rolling out my spring line soon.</i>

00:03.321 --> 00:05.283
Now, as part of that fashion show,
this class

00:05.323 --> 00:07.839
is gonna do a little pre-show.
Want to jumpstart your career?

00:07.857 --> 00:09.890
- That's where you can do it.
- Adena, hi.

00:09.926 --> 00:11.391
- Kat, hi.
- This is Tia,

00:11.427 --> 00:13.227
- my campaign manager.
- Nice to meet you.

00:13.262 --> 00:15.896
Adena talked to Jane.
She said that what happened

00:15.932 --> 00:17.397
in Paris was a mistake.

00:17.433 --> 00:18.899
I don't think she's over you, Kat.

00:18.935 --> 00:20.734
- We're doing it.
- The Pamela Dolan story?

00:20.769 --> 00:22.769
Doing this piece is gonna
put Jacqueline back on top

00:22.804 --> 00:24.671
- where she belongs.
- We are gonna bring Pamela

00:24.707 --> 00:26.973
- in here and get a statement.
- Here we go.

00:27.008 --> 00:29.142
Yes, here we go.

00:41.957 --> 00:44.458
- Hi.
<i>- Hey, babe.</i>

00:45.182 --> 00:46.460
What a nice surprise.

00:46.495 --> 00:48.128
- What are you doing?
<i>- I just finished this, uh,</i>

00:48.163 --> 00:49.829
<i>reading, and I thought I would check in</i>

00:49.865 --> 00:51.965
<i>with you before my book party tonight.</i>

00:52.000 --> 00:54.534
I am just going over my notes

00:54.570 --> 00:56.936
for this Pamela Dolan interview.

00:56.972 --> 00:58.972
<i>- Whoa, wait, is that...</i>
- Tomorrow.

00:59.007 --> 01:02.276
She's coming into the office
to meet with me and Jacqueline.

01:02.311 --> 01:04.510
- It all comes down to this.
<i>- Did I ever tell you</i>

01:04.545 --> 01:06.479
<i>that Pamela once stole
my cab outside this</i>

01:06.514 --> 01:08.081
<i>perfume launch party?</i>

01:08.116 --> 01:09.489
<i>Yeah, when I tried to say something,</i>

01:09.518 --> 01:11.651
<i>she, like, went ballistic.
Nearly ripped my head off.</i>

01:11.686 --> 01:13.820
<i>It was genuinely frightening.</i>

01:13.855 --> 01:15.454
Is this anecdote supposed
to be helping right now?

01:15.490 --> 01:17.425
<i>Uh, sorry.</i>

01:17.825 --> 01:20.459
- Just make sure you're ready.
- We are ready

01:20.495 --> 01:22.962
for personal threats, legal threats...

01:22.998 --> 01:24.363
Bomb threats.

01:24.399 --> 01:26.199
<i>Sorry, I, uh...</i>

01:26.234 --> 01:28.567
<i>I just found out I'm
gonna be on NPR tomorrow.</i>

01:28.603 --> 01:31.304
- What? Seriously?
<i>- Yeah. Apparently their booker</i>

01:31.339 --> 01:33.807
<i>thinks that I'm the next Jay McInerney.</i>

01:33.842 --> 01:35.474
And you did it without the coke.

01:35.510 --> 01:37.010
- Cheers.
<i>- Thank you.</i>

01:38.834 --> 01:39.645
That's amazing.

01:39.681 --> 01:42.115
- I'm really happy for you.
<i>- And here come</i>

01:42.150 --> 01:44.383
<i>my talking points from my publicist.</i>

01:44.419 --> 01:46.219
<i>Uh, I should prep for this.</i>

01:46.254 --> 01:47.920
<i>I don't want to sound like an idiot</i>

01:47.955 --> 01:50.222
<i>in front of the National
Tote Bag Brigade.</i>

01:50.257 --> 01:51.357
Go.

01:51.392 --> 01:53.326
I have to go over this anyway.

01:53.361 --> 01:55.994
<i>You want to, uh,
give me a little send-off</i>

01:56.030 --> 01:57.697
<i>- before I go?</i>
- Goodbye.

01:57.732 --> 01:59.231
<i>Come on, give me something to work with.</i>

01:59.266 --> 02:00.719
<i>I'm all alone out here.</i>

02:02.937 --> 02:04.903
How about a dance?

02:04.939 --> 02:06.672
<i>That sounds amazing.</i>

02:06.708 --> 02:08.874
I will need music.

02:08.908 --> 02:10.876
<i>I'm on it.</i>

02:12.880 --> 02:14.980
<i>- Good work, Charlie.
- ♪ All the bad bitches ♪</i>

02:15.015 --> 02:17.450
<i>Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.</i>

02:21.789 --> 02:23.723
How about this?

02:25.259 --> 02:26.792
<i>Drop it, drop it.</i>

02:26.828 --> 02:28.361
<i>Drop it.</i>

02:30.720 --> 02:31.847
Hi.

02:40.908 --> 02:42.707
- So...
- Um...

02:42.743 --> 02:45.911
- Sorry.
- No, you... you go.

02:45.946 --> 02:48.713
I owe you an apology, Kat.

02:51.018 --> 02:53.252
You know...

02:53.287 --> 02:57.089
waiting for my visa
to come through was...

02:57.124 --> 03:00.225
a really tough time for me.

03:00.261 --> 03:04.062
I was starting over again,
I wasn't making any money

03:04.098 --> 03:06.765
on my own, I couldn't leave

03:06.800 --> 03:10.903
the country or... or see my family.

03:10.938 --> 03:14.105
And I felt trapped and scared

03:14.140 --> 03:16.941
and confused.

03:16.976 --> 03:20.811
I mean, of course I couldn't produce.

03:20.846 --> 03:25.316
And when you called me out in Paris...

03:25.351 --> 03:29.586
I was so in it that
I couldn't see any of that.

03:29.622 --> 03:31.622
You didn't want to do things halfway,

03:31.657 --> 03:34.825
and I panicked and I ran.

03:34.860 --> 03:38.229
- I'm really sorry, Kat.
- It's not all on you.

03:38.264 --> 03:40.097
I...

03:40.133 --> 03:43.034
I made a lot of mistakes.

03:44.938 --> 03:46.904
The whole "open relationship"
thing and...

03:46.940 --> 03:49.240
I just...
I didn't know what I was doing,

03:49.275 --> 03:52.176
and I'm sorry for that, too.

03:53.513 --> 03:54.878
We didn't make things easy

03:54.914 --> 03:56.348
for each other, did we?

03:56.848 --> 03:57.891
No.

03:58.883 --> 04:01.451
Not really.

04:01.486 --> 04:03.954
You know, looking back,
there are a lot of things

04:03.989 --> 04:06.522
I would have done differently.

04:06.558 --> 04:09.525
- What?
- I wouldn't have ran.

04:13.298 --> 04:15.165
Uh, s-sorry.

04:15.200 --> 04:18.801
Um, election's in 48 hours,
so I'm on the clock right now.

04:24.109 --> 04:26.476
I should probably get going.

04:26.511 --> 04:29.879
- I gotta be up really early.
- It's understandable.

04:31.549 --> 04:34.384
If you want to come
by the studio or just hang out,

04:34.419 --> 04:36.142
be nice to see you again.

04:36.921 --> 04:40.155
I'm really busy right now,
but maybe after the election.

04:40.191 --> 04:42.224
Yeah.

04:43.895 --> 04:46.362
I will see you around.

04:46.397 --> 04:48.664
- Bye.
- Okay.

04:58.242 --> 05:00.376
So, everyone,
by now you should have all received

05:00.411 --> 05:02.745
model contacts for your show, yes?

05:02.780 --> 05:04.680
Yes? Good.

05:04.716 --> 05:07.049
Now, of course, you're free
to use this space for fittings.

05:07.084 --> 05:10.419
And, um, finally...
and not that you need reminding,

05:10.454 --> 05:12.722
but many of New York's biggest buyers

05:12.757 --> 05:14.323
will be in attendance.

05:14.358 --> 05:16.225
Numerous designers
have gone through sitting

05:16.260 --> 05:18.694
right where you are to having
their very own clothing lines,

05:18.730 --> 05:22.231
so I would strongly suggest
you spend the next few days

05:22.266 --> 05:25.934
making sure that you are truly,
truly ready.

05:31.008 --> 05:33.808
- We better get to work.
- Yeah, but I have to get

05:33.844 --> 05:35.710
to work first. See ya.

05:35.746 --> 05:39.296
- Bye.
- Then we said goodnight

05:39.331 --> 05:41.232
and I buried my feelings
in a pint of fro-yo.

05:41.267 --> 05:42.784
- Mm.
- Wow, that's a lot.

05:42.819 --> 05:44.453
- I know.
- Thank you.

05:44.488 --> 05:45.854
But it had dark chocolate
chips in it and I just...

05:45.889 --> 05:47.622
No, I wasn't talking about the fro-yo.

05:47.658 --> 05:49.091
- I was talking about Adena.
- Oh.

05:49.126 --> 05:51.093
She basically said that
she wants you back.

05:51.352 --> 05:52.180
Hey, does she even have

05:52.229 --> 05:54.263
a gallery opening,
or is this just part of a ruse

05:54.298 --> 05:56.065
for her to be in the same city as you?

05:56.100 --> 05:57.632
Ugh, I don't know. I'm so confused.

05:57.668 --> 05:59.467
That was literally
the opposite of closure.

05:59.502 --> 06:01.436
- Yeah, it was "open-sure."
- Yes.

06:01.471 --> 06:03.804
Adena nudged the door wide open and...

06:04.025 --> 06:06.574
Now things are different.

06:06.609 --> 06:08.676
Yes, things are different and I...
I just...

06:08.711 --> 06:11.312
I can't focus on this
right now because I have

06:11.347 --> 06:13.081
an election to win.
Which reminds me, uh,

06:13.116 --> 06:14.982
did Ryan mail in his absentee vote?

06:15.017 --> 06:17.585
Oh, hey, I saw he's doing
an interview with NPR.

06:17.620 --> 06:19.087
- Oh, yeah.
- How does it feel to be dating

06:19.122 --> 06:21.122
New York City's hottest new writer?

06:21.157 --> 06:23.391
Uh, well, when we actually talk,
it feels great.

06:23.426 --> 06:25.893
- But, yeah, I'll remind him.
- Great, 'cause, you know...

06:25.928 --> 06:27.161
- Every vote counts.
- Yeah, we know.

06:27.197 --> 06:28.862
- Guess what?
- What?

06:28.898 --> 06:31.548
NY14 is sending a crew to
our polling station tomorrow.

06:31.634 --> 06:32.702
You know what that means, right?

06:32.769 --> 06:36.537
- I'm gonna be on NY14 again?
- Yes, but the race is close.

06:36.573 --> 06:37.938
They wouldn't do that if it wasn't.

06:37.974 --> 06:39.640
- Oh, wow.
- Final push.

06:39.675 --> 06:41.308
It's been the "final push"
since we started, though.

06:41.343 --> 06:43.243
Push it hard, ladies, and give birth

06:43.278 --> 06:46.313
- to a beautiful electoral child.
- Okay.

06:49.451 --> 06:51.118
Hey, Casey, it's Sutton Brady.

06:51.153 --> 06:52.820
I got your number from Julian Grant.

06:52.855 --> 06:55.589
He said you were gonna be
modeling in the show.

06:55.625 --> 06:57.290
Yes, I am at "Scarlet Magazine."

06:57.326 --> 06:58.826
It's in Midtown.

06:58.861 --> 07:01.294
2:00 p.m. is, uh, great.

07:01.330 --> 07:03.030
Okay, see you then.

07:03.065 --> 07:05.065
Red, I apologize in advance but I am

07:05.101 --> 07:07.534
- in desperate need of your help.
- That is literally my job.

07:07.569 --> 07:10.070
This isn't your job...

07:10.106 --> 07:12.305
but Carly's not feeling well
and I couldn't find a sitter.

07:12.341 --> 07:14.541
I... I know how busy show prep is,
but if you could

07:14.576 --> 07:16.110
just keep an eye on her
for a couple of hours

07:16.145 --> 07:17.552
while I run to some meetings...

07:18.347 --> 07:21.114
She's not contagious, I don't think.

07:21.150 --> 07:23.883
Of course.

07:33.061 --> 07:34.472
Sorry.

07:41.203 --> 07:43.570
Pamela Dolan is here.

07:43.605 --> 07:46.506
- Hello.
- Jacqueline Carlyle.

07:46.542 --> 07:48.208
It's lovely to finally meet you.

07:48.243 --> 07:50.076
I'm surprised it's taken this long.

07:50.111 --> 07:52.045
This is my colleague, Jane Sloan.

07:52.080 --> 07:55.515
I enjoyed your article on egg freezing.

07:55.551 --> 07:58.184
Don't keep them on ice too long.

08:00.755 --> 08:03.489
- I'm just gonna...
- By all means.

08:05.293 --> 08:09.095
Well, I think we should just,
uh, dive right in.

08:09.130 --> 08:11.964
We are doing a feature
on your relationship

08:12.000 --> 08:14.033
with some of the models
that you've worked with over the years,

08:14.069 --> 08:15.702
and we just had
a few questions to ask you.

08:15.737 --> 08:17.427
Oh, is that why I'm here?

08:19.574 --> 08:21.540
Over the course of our reporting
we have spoken

08:21.576 --> 08:24.110
to five women who have
accused you of physical

08:24.145 --> 08:26.545
and psychological abuse on set.

08:26.581 --> 08:29.015
The first, Eden Verbrugge...

08:29.050 --> 08:31.951
Ah, yes, Eden.

08:31.986 --> 08:35.486
Great cheekbones, no work ethic.

08:35.523 --> 08:37.623
I have no comment on that.

08:37.658 --> 08:39.424
You haven't even heard
the allegation yet.

08:39.460 --> 08:41.327
I don't need to.

08:43.163 --> 08:46.732
Okay, um, we have another woman,

08:46.767 --> 08:48.767
Ingrid Halvorson.

08:48.802 --> 08:51.403
She said that during a shoot
in which she was suspended

08:51.439 --> 08:54.673
- in mid-air...
- Again, no comment.

08:56.210 --> 08:58.110
So...

08:58.145 --> 09:01.580
in regards to the other
three women's allegations,

09:01.616 --> 09:04.582
- no comment?
- Now you're getting the hang of it.

09:04.618 --> 09:06.451
You used to be a big-time
war reporter, weren't you?

09:06.486 --> 09:10.087
- I was.
- And now, what?

09:10.123 --> 09:12.123
You do takedowns of other women

09:12.158 --> 09:14.825
- to sell a few more magazines?
- I don't do takedowns.

09:14.861 --> 09:17.295
- I just tell the truth.
- How do you sleep at night?

09:17.330 --> 09:18.563
We could ask you the same question.

09:18.598 --> 09:21.266
I'm sleeping very well, thank you.

09:25.872 --> 09:28.005
Good luck with your reporting.

09:28.040 --> 09:30.941
I look forward to reading
the story when it hits

09:30.977 --> 09:34.479
- the newsstands in...
- Three weeks.

09:38.184 --> 09:40.318
Well, she's lovely.

09:40.353 --> 09:42.887
She definitely has another play.

09:49.128 --> 09:50.342
You got this, Kat.

09:51.263 --> 09:53.463
Hey, Councilwoman.

09:53.499 --> 09:56.399
- Hi, thank you.
- Big election tomorrow.

09:56.435 --> 09:58.135
We're voting for you.

10:00.006 --> 10:01.326
There she is.

10:01.373 --> 10:02.772
You rock, girl!

10:10.650 --> 10:12.349
Thank you.

10:12.384 --> 10:13.884
Aww.

10:13.919 --> 10:15.986
- Well, there she is.
- "New York Post"

10:16.022 --> 10:18.054
- election primer?
- Yes, they say you've mounted

10:18.089 --> 10:21.124
a spirited upstart campaign
that will come down

10:21.160 --> 10:23.293
- to the wire.
- Oh.

10:23.328 --> 10:25.028
Nice to agree with the "Post" for once.

10:25.063 --> 10:26.996
- Proud of you, Kat.
- Thanks.

10:27.032 --> 10:28.798
Even though I will never,
ever forgive you

10:28.833 --> 10:30.967
for leaving "Scarlet"
to do whatever it is

10:31.002 --> 10:33.036
- a City Councilwoman does.
- Well, that wouldn't be

10:33.071 --> 10:35.872
- for another couple months, so...
- Kat.

10:35.907 --> 10:38.441
I was just talking to
Patrick about potential

10:38.477 --> 10:40.177
new social media heads.

10:40.212 --> 10:42.379
- I will have him loop you in.
- Oh, well, I wouldn't

10:42.414 --> 10:44.381
take office for another few months.

10:44.416 --> 10:46.416
Well, it might take that long
to find someone.

10:46.451 --> 10:48.718
It's not easy to replace family, Kat.

10:50.989 --> 10:53.255
You get to pick the new you.

10:53.291 --> 10:55.291
- Whoop-whoop.
- Yeah.

10:55.326 --> 10:57.147
_

10:57.551 --> 11:01.177
_

11:10.140 --> 11:13.742
So we'll just take this
in a bit on the sides.

11:13.777 --> 11:16.412
Um, sorry, do you actually
mind just putting that down

11:16.447 --> 11:17.546
- while I...
- Oh, sorry.

11:17.582 --> 11:20.782
That's okay. Thanks.

11:20.818 --> 11:23.118
Okay, and then...

11:23.153 --> 11:24.853
would you mind slipping
on the other dress?

11:24.888 --> 11:26.554
- Mm-hmm.
- Great.

11:26.590 --> 11:29.724
- How you doing, Carly?
- Head still hurts.

11:29.759 --> 11:31.926
Let me know if I can do anything, okay?

11:41.122 --> 11:43.471
All right. This is still a sample size.

11:43.506 --> 11:45.906
- How is this too big?
- I'm on a cleanse.

11:45.942 --> 11:47.141
Gotcha.

11:47.176 --> 11:49.410
Oh, oh, no, no, no. Sorry.

11:49.446 --> 11:51.812
Carly, uh, this is
for a really important shoot.

11:51.848 --> 11:53.481
I just wanted to see how it looked.

11:53.516 --> 11:54.782
I can come back another
time if that's easier.

11:54.817 --> 11:56.751
No, it's totally fine.

11:56.786 --> 11:58.819
Carly, would you mind just sitting here

11:58.855 --> 12:01.756
and trying not to touch anything?

12:02.892 --> 12:05.092
Okay, let's see.

12:07.130 --> 12:09.063
Eden, hi. Uh, it's Jane.

12:09.098 --> 12:11.065
I was just about to call you.

12:11.100 --> 12:12.933
I got this weird email from a reporter

12:12.969 --> 12:14.568
at the "New York Star."

12:14.603 --> 12:16.170
<i>He wanted to interview me for a story</i>

12:16.205 --> 12:18.438
<i>on bad model behavior.</i>

12:18.474 --> 12:20.607
I mean, I'm barely on anyone's radar.

12:20.643 --> 12:23.010
- Why would he reach out?
- When was this?

12:23.045 --> 12:25.746
<i>Yesterday.</i>

12:25.782 --> 12:28.949
Okay, um, just let me know
if they reach out again.

12:28.985 --> 12:30.918
<i>- Okay.</i>
- Thanks, Eden.

12:30.953 --> 12:32.486
Bye.

12:32.521 --> 12:34.954
- Jacqueline, got a sec?
- Yeah.

12:34.990 --> 12:36.856
I think we're getting scooped.

12:36.892 --> 12:39.325
- By who?
- By the "New York Star."

12:39.360 --> 12:42.395
I'm guessing Pamela
tipped them off herself.

12:42.430 --> 12:44.363
She knew that she couldn't
stop us from publishing

12:44.399 --> 12:47.500
so she wanted to get ahead of it.

12:47.535 --> 12:49.368
That's why she wasn't worried.

12:49.404 --> 12:51.237
Hold tight.

12:56.744 --> 12:58.711
Okay, while we have a second,
let's go over tomorrow's, uh,

12:58.746 --> 13:01.247
election-day schedule,
which is jam-packed.

13:01.283 --> 13:03.016
- Yep.
- Uh, so, polls open at 6:00,

13:03.051 --> 13:04.583
- we are up at 6:00 a.m.
- Got it.

13:04.619 --> 13:07.786
NY14 interview is at 8:00 a.m.

13:10.457 --> 13:14.860
- You not feeling these, or...
- Uh, no. Not really.

13:14.895 --> 13:16.895
Kat, you know, um, this interview

13:16.931 --> 13:20.632
is our last chance to
reach undecided voters.

13:20.667 --> 13:23.702
I guess I'm just hoping
you're saving your enthusiasm

13:23.737 --> 13:25.470
- for the camera, or...
- Yeah.

13:25.505 --> 13:27.806
Yeah, sorry, I...

13:27.842 --> 13:30.642
I just... I had this conversation
with Jacqueline this morning.

13:30.677 --> 13:32.845
She was talking about
finding my replacement.

13:32.880 --> 13:35.981
I'm just kind of freaking out
a little bit.

13:36.016 --> 13:38.516
Okay, well, save the freak-out

13:38.552 --> 13:40.152
for when you win
this thing and you're in

13:40.187 --> 13:42.086
- your brand-new office.
- Oh.

13:42.121 --> 13:45.089
Whatever fear or anxiety you have...

13:45.124 --> 13:46.757
nip it in the butt.

13:46.792 --> 13:48.359
You know, this is the last
vibe you want to give off

13:48.394 --> 13:50.461
when you're on TV and
you're asking people

13:50.496 --> 13:52.296
- to vote for you.
- Yeah, yeah.

13:52.332 --> 13:53.764
Understood.

13:53.799 --> 13:55.233
- Game face on.
- Cool.

13:55.523 --> 13:57.401
Okay, I'll see you later.

14:07.604 --> 14:10.005
_

14:11.084 --> 14:13.117
<i>I should start by asking:
How much of this</i>

14:13.152 --> 14:16.052
<i>- is autobiographical?
- You know, I dated a lot,</i>

14:16.088 --> 14:19.089
<i>- had a lot of fun.
- Sounds like too much fun.</i>

14:19.124 --> 14:20.971
<i>- Gross.
- Look, I... I think there's</i>

14:21.026 --> 14:23.526
<i>something gravitational about the allure</i>

14:23.561 --> 14:25.598
<i>of being single in New York.</i>

14:26.268 --> 14:28.265
<i>You know, the feeling of
leaving your apartment and having</i>

14:28.300 --> 14:29.933
<i>no idea where the night'll take you.</i>

14:29.968 --> 14:32.568
<i>It's a high that's hard to stop chasing.</i>

14:32.604 --> 14:34.737
<i>Have you stopped?</i>

14:34.773 --> 14:38.366
<i>W-well, I'm in a relationship,
so by definition, I have.</i>

14:38.401 --> 14:40.911
<i>- A very clinical answer.</i>
- Hmm.

14:40.946 --> 14:42.545
<i>Hey, everything's a trade-off, right?</i>

14:42.580 --> 14:44.480
<i>I... I'd be lying if I said a part of me</i>

14:44.516 --> 14:47.317
<i>wasn't still attracted to that life.</i>

14:47.352 --> 14:49.286
Yeah, that's not helping my stress.

14:49.321 --> 14:50.408
Here you go.

14:51.023 --> 14:52.187
You guys?

14:52.223 --> 14:54.990
Carly is killing me.

14:55.026 --> 14:57.660
I am trying so hard to
get ready for this show

14:57.695 --> 14:59.662
and she is not helping,
and I'm not even sure

14:59.697 --> 15:02.097
- that she's actually sick.
- Didn't she used to fake sick

15:02.133 --> 15:03.666
when she first moved in with Oliver?

15:03.701 --> 15:06.001
She did,
but she's in a much better place now.

15:06.037 --> 15:09.271
I can't imagine what it could be.

15:09.307 --> 15:11.340
- Food coma.
- What?

15:11.375 --> 15:13.643
Give her a big lunch
and then she'll pass out

15:13.678 --> 15:16.111
in the conference room.
I've done it many, many times.

15:16.147 --> 15:18.948
I thought that those were power naps.

15:18.983 --> 15:20.516
Maybe they were, maybe they weren't.

15:20.552 --> 15:22.318
- I see.
- Poisoning children.

15:22.353 --> 15:24.253
Truly a new low. I love it.

15:24.638 --> 15:25.854
Oh, my God.

15:25.889 --> 15:28.122
Is this our last fashion
closet before you become

15:28.158 --> 15:29.326
a public official?

15:30.060 --> 15:32.861
Okay, I'm having
a mild case of the "anxiet,"

15:32.896 --> 15:35.797
so I would love it if
we could just calm down.

15:35.833 --> 15:38.199
- Don't jinx it.
- It's not even about that.

15:38.234 --> 15:40.368
- It's more "if I do win."
- You're gonna win.

15:40.403 --> 15:42.503
- Oh, my God, stop.
- Okay, I have

15:42.538 --> 15:44.172
to excuse myself. I'm getting emotional.

15:44.207 --> 15:45.373
Yeah, I gotta go too.

15:45.408 --> 15:47.475
But, hey, you're gonna kill it.

15:47.510 --> 15:49.177
Thanks.

15:53.516 --> 15:55.583
Oh, really? With the slow turn?

15:55.618 --> 15:57.018
I-it's weird.

15:57.053 --> 15:59.153
Leave, please.

16:07.563 --> 16:09.263
Bye.

16:30.847 --> 16:32.883
Hi. Okay, so,

16:32.918 --> 16:36.020
how does a burger
and fries and a shake sound?

16:36.055 --> 16:37.387
- Filling.
- But good, right?

16:37.422 --> 16:38.921
Come on, my treat. Let's go.

16:39.024 --> 16:41.391
- I'm actually not hungry.
- You have to eat something.

16:41.426 --> 16:43.426
- What about a juice?
- No, juice is not food.

16:43.462 --> 16:46.296
- It was for that model.
- Okay.

16:50.870 --> 16:52.770
Carly, is everything okay?

16:52.805 --> 16:56.506
- Told you, my stomach hurts.
- I thought it was your head.

16:56.542 --> 16:58.676
Carly.

17:00.312 --> 17:01.611
It's picture day.

17:01.647 --> 17:03.147
That's why I didn't
want to go to school.

17:03.182 --> 17:05.082
I don't understand.

17:05.117 --> 17:08.851
It's picture day, and I feel ugly, okay?

17:10.722 --> 17:12.821
Oh, Carly, hey.

17:14.492 --> 17:16.291
Let's go for a walk.

17:16.327 --> 17:18.359
We'll talk about it.

17:18.396 --> 17:20.096
Come on.

17:20.131 --> 17:22.765
You were right. "The Star" is publishing

17:22.800 --> 17:24.567
their own Dolan story next week.

17:24.602 --> 17:27.136
It's about how hard it
was for her to make it

17:27.172 --> 17:29.972
in the male-dominated world
of fashion photography.

17:30.008 --> 17:31.974
That isn't an excuse for what she did.

17:32.010 --> 17:35.277
- I mean, the abuse, the NDAs...
- My guess is she'll downplay

17:35.313 --> 17:38.114
the rumors and say that it
was just part of her process.

17:38.149 --> 17:39.916
Shame our sources for bad behavior.

17:39.951 --> 17:42.251
She knew that a defensive PR
campaign would never work,

17:42.286 --> 17:43.686
so she attacked.

17:43.721 --> 17:46.088
Just not the way we thought she would.

17:47.368 --> 17:48.990
This doesn't negate our story.

17:49.026 --> 17:51.993
- We could still get traction.
- Maybe, but if we wait

17:52.029 --> 17:54.396
three weeks, we could miss
the news cycle completely.

17:54.432 --> 17:57.533
- So what do we do?
- We beat her to it.

17:58.402 --> 18:00.502
We publish immediately.

18:03.207 --> 18:05.574
Jacqueline,
if we give this to Patrick...

18:05.610 --> 18:08.076
It'll generate tons of
clicks on the dot-com,

18:08.112 --> 18:10.011
and it'll give the board
another reason to go all-in

18:10.047 --> 18:11.847
- with digital.
- So what does this mean

18:11.882 --> 18:13.649
for the fall issue?

18:13.684 --> 18:16.618
That is a tomorrow problem.

18:19.222 --> 18:21.356
Patrick, call me
as soon as you get this.

18:21.391 --> 18:23.958
It's urgent.

18:23.993 --> 18:25.627
<i>Hey, it's Ryan. Leave me a message</i>

18:25.662 --> 18:28.663
<i>- and I'll hit you back.</i>
- Hey, babe, it's me.

18:28.698 --> 18:30.465
Kind of a weird day at the office

18:30.500 --> 18:32.500
so I would love to talk.

18:32.535 --> 18:34.636
Also, I heard your interview.

18:34.671 --> 18:37.305
Cool story, bro.

18:37.340 --> 18:41.041
Anyways, uh,
just call me when you get this.

18:41.077 --> 18:42.710
Bye.

18:54.055 --> 18:56.757
Between bodies being weird and hormones

18:56.792 --> 18:59.359
and mean kids, I mean,

18:59.395 --> 19:01.094
seventh grade is not easy.

19:01.129 --> 19:02.596
I get it.

19:02.631 --> 19:05.231
No offense, but do you get it?

19:05.267 --> 19:07.967
- What do you mean?
- I mean, you're nice and all,

19:08.003 --> 19:11.271
but you're tall and thin,
and your boyfriend looks

19:11.307 --> 19:13.473
like a Ken doll,
just like everyone else on Instagram.

19:13.509 --> 19:15.074
Okay.

19:15.110 --> 19:17.811
Here's the thing about Instagram:

19:17.846 --> 19:19.478
It's not real life.

19:19.514 --> 19:21.814
And I know it can be hard
to remember when you see

19:21.849 --> 19:25.083
all these beautiful faces
and insane bodies.

19:25.119 --> 19:26.585
But, I mean,

19:26.621 --> 19:28.387
even your friends post
versions of their lives

19:28.423 --> 19:30.589
that aren't real sometimes.

19:30.625 --> 19:33.058
You can't compare yourself to that.

19:33.093 --> 19:35.394
And you're right: I was thin.

19:35.430 --> 19:38.197
But, like, in a super clumsy way.

19:38.232 --> 19:40.966
I also had, like, a lot of acne.

19:41.001 --> 19:42.030
It was...

19:42.102 --> 19:43.143
It was bad.

19:43.771 --> 19:46.639
But here's the thing:
I wouldn't change anything

19:46.674 --> 19:48.207
about that girl.

19:48.242 --> 19:50.108
She made me who I am.

19:50.144 --> 19:51.711
I like who I am.

19:51.746 --> 19:53.779
But then I look at everyone else...

19:53.815 --> 19:55.947
I promise you,
everyone else is just as self-conscious

19:55.982 --> 19:59.016
as you are. There are no exceptions.

19:59.052 --> 20:01.118
Believe me when I tell you
that half the battle

20:01.154 --> 20:04.356
in middle school is showing up,
and then remembering

20:04.391 --> 20:06.658
that it gets better.

20:06.693 --> 20:08.926
And that you can talk
to your Aunt Sutton

20:08.962 --> 20:11.095
about anything.

20:11.130 --> 20:13.264
So what time is this photo being taken?

20:13.299 --> 20:14.866
In an hour.

20:14.901 --> 20:16.267
But don't you have a lot of work to do?

20:16.302 --> 20:19.437
Oh, my God, I have so much work to do.

20:19.473 --> 20:21.473
But I think I can spare a few minutes

20:21.508 --> 20:23.508
to be your wingwoman.

20:23.543 --> 20:25.443
- What do you say?
- Okay.

20:25.479 --> 20:27.545
- Let's do this.
- Yeah!

20:28.013 --> 20:30.647
Come on. Taxi!

20:36.221 --> 20:38.121
<i>Well, it's a concern for me as well.</i>

20:38.156 --> 20:40.457
<i>And when reelected,
I promise to help reign in</i>

20:40.493 --> 20:42.693
<i>all of the luxury and
corporate development</i>

20:42.728 --> 20:44.094
<i>that has made this neighborhood</i>

20:44.129 --> 20:46.296
<i>- so unaffordable.</i>
- I-is he serious?

20:46.331 --> 20:47.865
"Affordable housing"?
That's part of the reason

20:47.900 --> 20:49.800
- why I ran against him.
- That's a great sign.

20:49.835 --> 20:51.301
Stealing our platform is a great sign?

20:51.336 --> 20:52.969
That means our platform's working.

20:53.005 --> 20:54.971
He's panicking.
We're pushing him on the issues

20:55.007 --> 20:57.508
- that matter to voters.
- Hmm.

20:57.543 --> 20:59.976
So, tonight we double down.

21:00.012 --> 21:02.579
Reynolds is reactive, Kat is proactive.

21:02.615 --> 21:04.414
Now let's knock on some damn doors.

21:04.449 --> 21:06.909
Earn that champagne tomorrow.
Or two-buck Chuck,

21:06.944 --> 21:08.418
based on the amount
of money we have left.

21:08.453 --> 21:10.253
Yeah. Thank you, Tia.

21:10.289 --> 21:11.588
Thank you, everybody.

21:13.025 --> 21:14.257
Last chance to knock on doors.

21:14.293 --> 21:15.858
- Let's make it count.
- Right.

21:15.894 --> 21:18.028
And then I'll see you tonight?

21:18.063 --> 21:19.595
Yeah.

21:37.379 --> 21:39.678
_

21:39.813 --> 21:44.336
_

21:52.796 --> 21:54.230
Hi.

21:54.365 --> 21:56.365
Hi.

22:01.925 --> 22:05.106
Wow, this is, uh...
this is a pretty cool spot.

22:06.356 --> 22:08.991
Yeah, it, um, belongs

22:09.026 --> 22:10.993
to the gallery owner.

22:11.028 --> 22:13.862
She actually owns the entire building.

22:13.898 --> 22:16.265
Cool.

22:16.300 --> 22:18.834
- Can I get you anything?
- Uh, yeah, I could do

22:18.869 --> 22:22.370
a glass of wi... er, some...
some tea, please.

22:32.049 --> 22:33.782
So?

22:34.785 --> 22:37.752
- What's going on?
- Uh, look, I know

22:37.788 --> 22:40.422
there's still a lot to, uh...

22:40.457 --> 22:43.792
unpack between us,
and now is not the time to do it,

22:43.827 --> 22:47.362
but I just really feel
like I need to talk to you

22:47.397 --> 22:50.432
as a friend who's really good

22:50.467 --> 22:51.966
at helping me see things clearly.

22:52.001 --> 22:54.636
Okay, of course.

22:54.671 --> 22:57.939
Okay, um...

22:57.974 --> 23:01.275
So, I am kind of

23:01.311 --> 23:02.777
freaking out right now.

23:02.813 --> 23:05.347
Uh, in case that wasn't really obvious.

23:05.382 --> 23:07.915
Well, the election is tomorrow,

23:07.951 --> 23:09.584
so it makes sense.

23:09.619 --> 23:12.086
Yeah, see, that's what I thought.

23:12.121 --> 23:15.021
But apparently, uh, showing weakness

23:15.057 --> 23:16.590
and getting elected don't go together,

23:16.625 --> 23:19.360
and I mean of course I... I want to help

23:19.395 --> 23:22.062
small businesses and I want
to help women get access

23:22.097 --> 23:25.766
to health care and I want
to change the world, but...

23:25.801 --> 23:27.568
what if I can't?

23:27.603 --> 23:30.738
I mean, I'm just a 26-year-old
social media director.

23:30.773 --> 23:33.507
What do I really know
about being a politician?

23:33.896 --> 23:35.376
And then, you know,

23:35.411 --> 23:38.479
today I was with Jacqueline
and... and Jane

23:38.514 --> 23:41.682
and Sutton, and it hit me:

23:41.717 --> 23:45.352
This is what I lose if I win.

23:45.388 --> 23:47.755
And of course, you know, I do...

23:47.790 --> 23:51.023
I do want to win, but...

23:51.058 --> 23:53.659
do I really want to give that up?

23:53.695 --> 23:56.863
I don't think you would have
gotten this far if you didn't.

23:56.898 --> 23:59.532
It's still a terrible feeling, though.

24:01.603 --> 24:04.036
Oh, wow, I am a terrible person.

24:04.071 --> 24:06.606
So many people busted
their asses to get me here

24:06.641 --> 24:09.609
and I... I can't talk

24:09.644 --> 24:12.077
to Tia about it, and...

24:12.113 --> 24:14.914
and Jane and Sutton have been
so busy, and they still

24:14.949 --> 24:16.549
find time to help me go canvassing,

24:16.584 --> 24:18.384
and I can't just be like,
"Oh, yeah, hey,

24:18.420 --> 24:20.453
"by the way, guys,

24:20.488 --> 24:21.692
I changed my mind."

24:23.758 --> 24:26.325
So, yeah.

24:26.360 --> 24:29.161
- Hi.
- Come.

24:29.196 --> 24:32.164
I want to show you something.

24:32.199 --> 24:34.199
Okay.

24:53.988 --> 24:56.088
Oh, wow.

24:57.191 --> 24:59.925
- When did you take that?
- It was on the same roll

24:59.961 --> 25:02.194
I took in Paris.

25:03.197 --> 25:04.729
I didn't have the heart to develop it

25:04.765 --> 25:06.965
for a long time.

25:09.069 --> 25:11.702
But when I saw this picture,

25:11.737 --> 25:13.471
it... it clicked.

25:13.506 --> 25:16.240
You did inspire me, Kat.

25:17.810 --> 25:20.278
With your grace, your fire,

25:20.313 --> 25:22.046
your spirit.

25:22.082 --> 25:24.115
And I know...

25:24.150 --> 25:27.818
that you'll do the same
for everyone else

25:27.854 --> 25:30.021
when you're elected.

25:31.691 --> 25:34.993
Only you can decide
what's best for you right now,

25:35.028 --> 25:37.495
but that Kat Edison I know,

25:37.530 --> 25:40.297
she is all about growth.

25:40.332 --> 25:41.932
I mean, you were only into boys

25:41.968 --> 25:45.102
when, uh, I first met you,
and look at you now.

25:49.742 --> 25:51.675
And since we have been apart,

25:51.711 --> 25:55.145
you have continued to grow.

25:55.180 --> 25:57.948
And you kept using your voice
to fight for the things

25:57.984 --> 26:00.851
that matter to you.

26:00.887 --> 26:03.621
And, yeah, if you continue
with that, you may have

26:03.656 --> 26:05.723
to leave "Scarlet"...

26:05.758 --> 26:07.691
which is scary.

26:07.727 --> 26:10.494
But I know you can handle it.

26:10.530 --> 26:13.262
If that's what you want.

26:16.635 --> 26:19.736
Yeah, I don't...
I don't want to run from this.

26:20.972 --> 26:23.305
Good.

26:37.656 --> 26:40.389
Uh, so, I...
I didn't realize it was so late.

26:40.425 --> 26:42.224
- I should probably head out.
- Yeah, you have

26:42.260 --> 26:44.794
- a big day tomorrow.
- Yeah.

26:49.067 --> 26:52.601
There...
there's an election party tomorrow.

26:52.636 --> 26:56.405
If you want to come it could be fun.

26:56.441 --> 26:59.841
- Could be terrible.
- Yeah, I'll be there.

27:04.782 --> 27:06.048
Okay.

27:06.084 --> 27:08.050
- Bye.
- Bye.

27:15.093 --> 27:17.259
So this is what you've been
working on instead of losing

27:17.295 --> 27:19.395
- to me in Forza?
- Uh, I think

27:19.430 --> 27:21.329
you might be confused.

27:21.364 --> 27:24.165
- What do you think?
- I think...

27:24.201 --> 27:26.067
you're about to blow up.

27:26.103 --> 27:27.696
It's a classic J and J joint.

27:28.037 --> 27:29.904
I just made that up. Not bad, right?

27:30.619 --> 27:33.074
- It's okay.
- Oh.

27:33.110 --> 27:34.409
Ryan.

27:34.444 --> 27:36.177
- Should I take this?
- No.

27:36.213 --> 27:38.246
- You sure?
- Hand it over.

27:39.983 --> 27:42.917
- Hi.
- Hey, Jane, hi.

27:42.952 --> 27:46.387
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah, it's a little loud.

27:46.423 --> 27:49.757
Yeah, um, what's up?

27:49.792 --> 27:51.892
How's it going? How are you?

27:51.928 --> 27:53.994
I'm okay. How are you?

27:54.029 --> 27:55.662
Also okay, yeah.

27:55.697 --> 27:58.632
Um, I miss you.

27:58.667 --> 28:01.635
Really? 'Cause I couldn't tell
from that radio interview

28:01.670 --> 28:04.138
- you did.
- Oh, come on, Jane.

28:04.173 --> 28:06.240
Don't do that. I'm...
You know what I'm doing?

28:06.275 --> 28:08.108
I'm out there just trying to sell books.

28:08.144 --> 28:09.943
<i>I'm not being real.</i>

28:09.978 --> 28:12.479
You know I feel about you, right?

28:12.515 --> 28:15.682
- Are you drunk?
- I've, uh... I've had a couple.

28:15.717 --> 28:18.652
Um, but I was calling

28:18.687 --> 28:21.121
'cause I just wanted

28:21.156 --> 28:23.489
to hear your voice, I guess.

28:23.525 --> 28:24.785
That's sweet.

28:27.362 --> 28:29.162
<i>- Is everything okay?</i>
- Yeah, yeah.

28:29.197 --> 28:30.396
Everything is great.

28:30.431 --> 28:32.532
Um...

28:32.567 --> 28:35.568
I'll call you tomorrow, okay?

28:35.603 --> 28:38.571
- I miss you.
- You mentioned that.

28:38.606 --> 28:40.674
Right.

28:40.709 --> 28:42.742
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

28:42.778 --> 28:44.844
Bye.

28:52.720 --> 28:54.453
Hey, babe.

28:54.489 --> 28:55.580
Hey.

28:56.857 --> 28:58.691
Mm.

28:58.726 --> 29:01.126
- You gonna be here a while?
- Yeah, it's looking like it.

29:01.162 --> 29:02.562
- You headed home?
- Nope.

29:02.597 --> 29:04.330
Nope, I'm gonna meet Dev for drinks.

29:04.365 --> 29:06.299
He's got something top
secret to talk to me about.

29:06.334 --> 29:08.467
Ah, well, as long as it has
nothing to do with Connecticut.

29:10.538 --> 29:12.305
- I'll see you at home.
- Okay.

29:12.340 --> 29:14.674
Actually, whatever happened

29:14.709 --> 29:17.909
- with adventures in babysitting?
- Get this: Carly was not sick.

29:17.944 --> 29:19.578
She just didn't want to go
to school because she didn't

29:19.613 --> 29:21.779
- want to get her picture taken.
- Mm.

29:21.815 --> 29:23.348
She also called you a Ken doll.

29:23.383 --> 29:24.616
Well, that's ridiculous.
He doesn't have a penis.

29:26.486 --> 29:28.587
God, she really broke my heart.

29:28.622 --> 29:31.456
But I gave her a pep-talk,
and I convinced her

29:31.491 --> 29:33.891
- to go back to school.
- That's really sweet.

29:33.927 --> 29:36.194
- I know how busy you are.
- I just can't imagine

29:36.230 --> 29:38.129
what it's like for her,
scrolling through Instagram

29:38.164 --> 29:41.600
and seeing all those models
drinking detox tea.

29:45.772 --> 29:48.039
- What?
- I just got an idea.

29:58.384 --> 29:59.951
- Hello.
- Hey, how are you?

29:59.986 --> 30:01.418
- I'm good, how are you?
- Good.

30:01.454 --> 30:02.720
Very good. We're just gonna finish

30:02.756 --> 30:04.088
setting up. We'll be with you soon.

30:04.124 --> 30:05.189
- Okay.
- See you in a bit.

30:05.225 --> 30:06.190
Bye.

30:06.226 --> 30:07.892
- Hello.
- Hi.

30:07.927 --> 30:09.761
- So I have something for you.
- Oh.

30:09.796 --> 30:11.929
- Hold out your wrist.
- Okay.

30:11.965 --> 30:13.058
Bam!

30:13.499 --> 30:15.633
- Whoa!
- I handed out those bad boys

30:15.668 --> 30:17.635
when I ran for Class
Treasurer senior year.

30:17.670 --> 30:19.535
- Oh.
- It was a landslide victory.

30:19.571 --> 30:21.571
- I thought I'd pass it on.
- It's very retro.

30:21.606 --> 30:23.640
- Yes.
- Still smells like Hollister.

30:24.227 --> 30:25.608
That was my signature scent.

30:25.644 --> 30:27.677
Hey, um, I'm just confused,
though, 'cause I'm wondering

30:27.712 --> 30:29.479
where the ballot measure
is for Beyoncé's birthday

30:29.514 --> 30:31.514
- being a national holiday.
- Oh, that comes after I win.

30:31.549 --> 30:33.449
- You've got my vote.
- Mm-hmm.

30:33.485 --> 30:36.419
Also, um, how was last night with Adena?

30:36.454 --> 30:38.288
It's probably not the best time.

30:38.323 --> 30:39.823
Right, right, right.

30:39.858 --> 30:41.792
- But do you think that...
- Ready?

30:41.827 --> 30:43.193
- Yeah.
- Let's do it.

30:43.228 --> 30:44.427
Okay, I'll see you guys at the party.

30:44.462 --> 30:46.830
Mm-hmm.
- Okay, bye.

30:46.865 --> 30:48.965
Hey, Cole.

30:51.770 --> 30:53.336
Why are you giving this to me?

30:53.371 --> 30:55.938
- We were scooped.
- Oh.

30:55.973 --> 30:57.973
Dolan has a competing story
running on Monday,

30:58.009 --> 30:59.742
so we need this out there immediately.

30:59.778 --> 31:02.144
It's already been fact-checked
and vetted by legal.

31:02.180 --> 31:05.147
I will have art send over the
images from our photo shoot

31:05.183 --> 31:07.750
ASAP, and loop in social to make sure

31:07.786 --> 31:10.320
- that the rollout is wide.
- Okay, I'll, uh, get PR

31:10.355 --> 31:14.023
to coordinate media and TV requests.

31:14.058 --> 31:16.626
You guys did truly amazing work.

31:16.661 --> 31:19.995
I am honored to be publishing this.

31:22.200 --> 31:24.233
- Wow.
- He's gonna take this

31:24.268 --> 31:25.835
and run with it, isn't he?

31:25.870 --> 31:28.137
We're doing the right thing, Jane.

31:32.443 --> 31:33.542
I know.

31:40.696 --> 31:42.095
You guys look great.
I'm gonna be right back.

31:42.130 --> 31:44.498
- Okay.
- Sounds good.

31:44.533 --> 31:47.433
- Hey, have you seen Jane?
- Uh, I think

31:47.468 --> 31:50.803
- she's at the bar.
- All right, thanks.

31:50.838 --> 31:52.605
- Hey.
- Hey.

31:52.640 --> 31:55.240
- Any word from Ryan?
- Actually, I was just checking

31:55.276 --> 31:58.076
to see if the Dolan story
was up, but no.

31:58.112 --> 32:00.145
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

32:00.181 --> 32:02.915
Oh, well if it isn't
the Councilwoman Elect.

32:02.950 --> 32:05.117
- It me.
- How you feeling?

32:05.152 --> 32:06.752
I feel good, you know?

32:06.788 --> 32:09.221
Polls closed 20 minutes ago,
I did everything I could,

32:09.256 --> 32:12.325
so I need a drink.

32:12.360 --> 32:13.826
- Or two.
- Well, maybe save

32:13.861 --> 32:15.761
the second one for after the speech.

32:15.797 --> 32:17.496
Actually, you can have as many
as you want after the speech.

32:17.532 --> 32:19.616
You've definitely earned it.

32:19.867 --> 32:22.000
- Oh, sorry, be right back.
- Okay.

32:23.537 --> 32:26.805
- Okay, spill it.
- I don't... I don't know.

32:26.840 --> 32:29.307
Tia's amazing. I mean, look around.

32:29.343 --> 32:31.609
I'm here because of her.

32:31.645 --> 32:34.512
But I am also here because of Adena.

32:34.548 --> 32:37.716
I just can't get her out of my head.

32:37.751 --> 32:41.386
- And she might swing by later.
- Does Tia know?

32:41.421 --> 32:43.988
- Yeah, it's not a big deal.
- Oh.

32:44.023 --> 32:45.623
You guys, it's posted.

32:45.659 --> 32:48.192
- The story is up.
- So proud of you.

32:48.228 --> 32:50.194
Yeah.

32:50.230 --> 32:52.731
- Oh.
- Yeah, it's...

32:52.766 --> 32:55.032
it's still a little weird
to not see it in "Scarlet,"

32:55.068 --> 32:57.369
but I'm just really happy
that it's out there.

32:57.404 --> 32:59.337
Well, I know
it's not the way you imagined it

32:59.372 --> 33:01.272
- but it's still pretty amazing.
- Yeah.

33:01.307 --> 33:03.107
- Yeah.
- Anyways, tonight

33:03.142 --> 33:05.176
- is your night.
- Ugh, no.

33:05.211 --> 33:06.795
It's our night.

33:07.046 --> 33:10.181
And before my life maybe changes forever

33:10.216 --> 33:12.016
I just want to say thank you.

33:12.051 --> 33:15.786
Well, your life may change,
but this won't.

33:15.821 --> 33:17.788
Your clothing will continue
to get worse, though.

33:17.823 --> 33:19.250
Occupational hazard.

33:19.692 --> 33:21.558
- Hey, speaking of clothing...
- Yeah?

33:21.594 --> 33:24.061
How do you guys feel about
walking in my fashion show?

33:24.097 --> 33:25.897
I thought you were getting
professional models?

33:25.932 --> 33:27.365
That was the plan,
but then after everything

33:27.400 --> 33:29.767
with Carly, I... I don't know.

33:29.802 --> 33:32.003
It just didn't feel right.
I don't want to make clothing

33:32.038 --> 33:33.837
that only fits models.
I want to make clothing

33:33.873 --> 33:36.940
- that fits everybody.
- Well, in that case, I'm down.

33:36.975 --> 33:39.075
- Yeah, I'm also down.
- Yay!

33:39.111 --> 33:40.777
- Should we get that one drink?
- Mm-hmm.

33:40.812 --> 33:42.545
Let's do it.

33:44.283 --> 33:45.848
Oh, my God.

33:45.884 --> 33:47.015
Ryan's here.

33:48.420 --> 33:51.955
That's why he was MIA.
He wanted to surprise you.

33:51.990 --> 33:53.390
I'll take it.

33:55.294 --> 33:58.161
- Oh, my God, hi.
- Hi.

34:01.066 --> 34:03.165
I can't believe this. What a surprise.

34:03.200 --> 34:05.568
Yeah, well,
Princeton's not that far away.

34:09.741 --> 34:11.706
I saw that your article was up.

34:11.743 --> 34:14.208
- I'm really proud of you.
- Thanks.

34:14.245 --> 34:16.110
But come on, we'll talk work later.

34:16.147 --> 34:18.347
Tonight we're celebrating Kat.

34:18.382 --> 34:20.750
I'm really happy you're here.

34:22.821 --> 34:25.286
Well, if it isn't my two favorite men

34:25.322 --> 34:26.856
- side-by-side.
- Oh.

34:26.891 --> 34:28.612
Well, I won't make you rank us.

34:28.993 --> 34:30.292
I was just telling your boyfriend

34:30.328 --> 34:31.788
what a lifesaver you are.

34:32.697 --> 34:35.331
Oh, she's amazing.

34:35.366 --> 34:37.733
Okay, I'm not a woman...
even though gender

34:37.768 --> 34:40.068
is a social construct and I can rock

34:40.103 --> 34:42.070
a fresh beat in a high pump
at a moment's notice...

34:42.943 --> 34:45.806
I am not a woman,

34:45.842 --> 34:49.143
and Carly needs strong
women in her life.

34:49.179 --> 34:50.411
Thank you for being there for her.

34:50.447 --> 34:53.014
It was my pleasure.

34:53.049 --> 34:54.239
Oh.

34:54.384 --> 34:55.617
Oh, gotta take this.

34:55.652 --> 34:57.085
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

34:57.120 --> 34:58.587
- Can I see it again?
- Of course.

35:00.524 --> 35:03.057
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

35:03.093 --> 35:05.293
So we have a very special

35:05.328 --> 35:07.729
literary guest here for one night only.

35:07.764 --> 35:09.230
Jane, you don't have to do that.

35:09.265 --> 35:10.966
So when am I gonna get my signed copy?

35:11.001 --> 35:12.901
- Oh, he charges for that now.
- You know, I haven't read it yet,

35:12.936 --> 35:14.335
but I did give it
a five-star rating on Amazon,

35:14.371 --> 35:17.004
so hoping for, you know, a discount.

35:17.039 --> 35:19.766
I read it, loved it,
and will totally pay for a signature.

35:21.811 --> 35:23.541
Oh, my God, guys, look.

35:25.214 --> 35:28.181
- Oh, we have to find Kat.
- Uh, yeah, we do.

35:28.217 --> 35:29.984
Uh, Jane.

35:30.019 --> 35:31.785
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah.

35:31.821 --> 35:33.453
Okay.

35:37.660 --> 35:39.960
- What's going on?
- I have to tell you

35:39.996 --> 35:42.730
about something.

35:42.765 --> 35:44.309
Okay.

35:45.267 --> 35:48.235
Something happened on tour.

35:49.704 --> 35:51.838
What do you mean?

35:51.873 --> 35:53.406
I screwed up.

35:53.441 --> 35:54.874
Last night, I was drunk.

35:54.910 --> 35:57.343
Uh, I was actually really, really drunk,

35:57.378 --> 35:59.979
and I kissed somebody else.

36:06.265 --> 36:08.557
- Last night?
- It didn't mean anything.

36:08.647 --> 36:10.346
I swear.

36:11.983 --> 36:13.716
So that's why you missed me
so much, huh?

36:13.752 --> 36:15.551
I know how bad it looks...

36:15.586 --> 36:17.720
or sounds.

36:17.756 --> 36:19.555
Yeah.

36:19.590 --> 36:21.457
You haven't even been gone that long.

36:21.492 --> 36:22.792
I know. I don't have any excuse

36:22.827 --> 36:25.194
other than the fact that I was drunk,

36:25.229 --> 36:27.730
but I... you have to know
that as soon as it happened

36:27.766 --> 36:29.832
I... I knew it was a mistake
and I stopped it.

36:29.868 --> 36:31.835
It didn't mean anything.

36:33.171 --> 36:35.237
Jane, I'm so, so sorry.

36:38.810 --> 36:40.777
Wow, I wish that I heard
that interview sooner.

36:40.812 --> 36:42.244
Would have saved us a lot of time.

36:42.280 --> 36:44.112
- Hey, can we just talk?
- I can't...

36:44.148 --> 36:45.280
I can't do this right now.

36:45.315 --> 36:47.115
Don't.

36:47.151 --> 36:48.917
- Don't touch me.
- Please...

36:48.952 --> 36:51.119
And don't follow me, either.

37:02.800 --> 37:04.132
Is this a good time
to go to the bathroom?

37:04.168 --> 37:05.901
- Mom.
- I don't want

37:05.936 --> 37:07.368
- to miss anything.
- Yeah, okay. Yes,

37:07.404 --> 37:09.004
I think you're okay. Just hurry.

37:09.039 --> 37:11.439
- Yeah.
- All right.

37:11.474 --> 37:13.575
- Hey.
- Oh, I already had my one.

37:13.610 --> 37:16.411
Eh, nurse it.

37:16.446 --> 37:17.878
Hey, Kat fans.

37:17.914 --> 37:19.880
Here I am with Kat Edison
just moments before

37:19.916 --> 37:21.616
the results come in. Say hi, Kat.

37:21.651 --> 37:23.184
- Hello.
- Incredible.

37:23.220 --> 37:25.587
- Posting that.
- Thank you, Patrick.

37:25.622 --> 37:27.755
- Tagging you!
- Thank you!

37:27.790 --> 37:30.592
- Oh, this waiting is killing me.
- Yeah, any minute now

37:30.627 --> 37:32.293
it'll all be over.

37:32.329 --> 37:33.628
Unless it's a recount, which...
let's pray

37:33.663 --> 37:35.530
that doesn't happen.

37:35.565 --> 37:38.132
Win or lose, Kat, I am so proud of you.

37:38.167 --> 37:41.001
- You kicked ass.
- Oh... we kicked ass.

37:41.037 --> 37:43.304
- Yeah, we're a good team.
- Mm-hmm.

37:44.267 --> 37:46.807
It'll be kind of nice when this is over.

37:46.843 --> 37:49.744
We can, um, figure this out.

38:05.661 --> 38:07.461
- Hey, everything okay?
- Yeah.

38:07.496 --> 38:10.964
- Yeah, it's just Dev again.
- Oh, my God, she's winning.

38:13.469 --> 38:15.969
Wow, that'll be really crazy.

38:16.004 --> 38:17.738
Are you sure everything's okay?

38:17.773 --> 38:19.973
Yeah, yeah, definitely.

38:21.543 --> 38:23.777
Out with it.

38:23.812 --> 38:25.345
Fine.

38:25.381 --> 38:27.280
You remember how Dev's
been trying to get me

38:27.315 --> 38:28.648
to talk about this work
thing he's got going?

38:28.683 --> 38:32.084
- Mm-hmm.
- Turns out he got a bunch

38:32.119 --> 38:34.620
of seed money to start
a V.C. shop that invests

38:34.656 --> 38:37.079
in clean energy, and he wants me
to help him run it.

38:37.325 --> 38:39.392
Oh, my God. Richard, that's amazing.

38:39.427 --> 38:41.727
You've wanted to do
something like that forever.

38:41.763 --> 38:43.362
Mm-hmm.

38:43.398 --> 38:45.665
It is incredible.

38:45.700 --> 38:48.567
It's in San Francisco.

38:48.603 --> 38:50.836
Oh.

38:50.871 --> 38:52.672
Well, uh, what... what did you tell him?

38:52.707 --> 38:55.240
Obviously I told him I couldn't do it.

38:56.487 --> 38:57.976
That'd be insane.

38:58.012 --> 39:00.879
- Hey, um, I need to talk to you.
- Oh, okay.

39:11.558 --> 39:13.391
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey.

39:14.201 --> 39:15.527
98% of the votes are in.

39:15.562 --> 39:17.629
- Still too close to call.
- Oh, my God.

39:17.664 --> 39:20.632
- Refresh it again.
- Uh-huh.

39:20.667 --> 39:22.834
- Yeah, and again.
- Uh-huh.

39:25.238 --> 39:27.372
Okay, hold tight.

39:32.245 --> 39:33.811
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:33.846 --> 39:35.879
- Hi, thank you for coming.
- Of course.

39:35.914 --> 39:37.748
- Oh, my God.
- Ms. Councilwoman.

39:37.783 --> 39:40.351
Now, you know,
I am not one to miss a party.

39:40.842 --> 39:42.052
Hi.

39:42.087 --> 39:44.333
Hi. Uh, they're about to announce it.

39:44.590 --> 39:46.256
- All right, come on.
- Okay.

39:47.893 --> 39:49.460
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

39:49.495 --> 39:52.363
- No, we'll talk later.
- Okay.

39:52.398 --> 39:53.897
- Oh, my God.
- Everyone,

39:53.932 --> 39:56.066
could I have your attention?

39:56.101 --> 39:57.701
It's time.

40:17.756 --> 40:19.389
<i>And he'll be reporting from Conley's</i>

40:19.424 --> 40:21.224
