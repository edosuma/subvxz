00:00.000 --> 00:02.920
Previously on Evermoor Chronicles...

00:03.040 --> 00:06.200
We need three fated villagers to inhabit.

00:06.400 --> 00:10.000
You're releasing the founders?
They brought the world to chaos.

00:10.160 --> 00:11.440
No!
(LANTERN BREAKS)

00:11.560 --> 00:14.320
Where is the third? Where is our sister?

00:14.480 --> 00:17.320
You must find the other half
to get our sister back.

00:17.480 --> 00:20.560
We will,
and Bridget will bind us back together.

00:20.760 --> 00:22.880
Noooo!

00:23.000 --> 00:26.680
So nice to see you again, Bridget.

00:28.960 --> 00:32.520
# I left my friends for my new life

00:32.680 --> 00:35.880
# How will I know it's gonna be alright?

00:36.000 --> 00:42.440
# I gotta take control
And write my destiny

00:42.560 --> 00:45.360
# The future's still untold

00:45.480 --> 00:47.840
# Nobody else can see

00:48.000 --> 00:53.600
# If this will be for Evermoor #

01:05.920 --> 01:07.600
Cameron!

01:09.600 --> 01:12.800
Hey! Walk you to school?

01:12.960 --> 01:18.320
Okay, but don’t do anything too cute.
Or too funny.

01:18.480 --> 01:20.320
Or too you.

01:22.200 --> 01:23.480
Cut the smiling.

01:24.960 --> 01:27.320
So, I have a story problem for you.

01:27.480 --> 01:29.800
OK.
"The mystery of the brilliant student

01:29.960 --> 01:31.440
and her terrible grades".

01:31.560 --> 01:34.840
Your school report arrived this morning.
A word?

01:36.640 --> 01:40.280
OK. I can explain.
Explain a “C” in Chemistry, Tara!

01:40.440 --> 01:43.040
Chemistry is completely different here!

01:43.200 --> 01:46.160
The first element on the periodic table
isn't hydrogen.

01:46.360 --> 01:48.280
It’s destiny.

01:48.440 --> 01:52.480
You need to turn this around,
or you can kiss your boyfriend goodbye.

01:54.640 --> 01:58.440
So, my mom wants me to see less of you.

01:58.560 --> 02:02.280
Wow.
I’ve never been a bad influence before.

02:02.440 --> 02:05.200
You’re not. Sorry to disappoint you.

02:05.400 --> 02:09.200
Would she like me more or less
if she knew I had a magical spider?

02:10.200 --> 02:14.600
I think you’d go from "bad influence"
to "crazy guy who talks to bugs"...

02:16.480 --> 02:19.000
You know, I’ve been thinking.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.960
Of everything magic’s done to me. To us.

02:23.080 --> 02:26.120
Flynn’s like
the last piece of the magical puzzle.

02:26.320 --> 02:28.920
He is?
(SPRITELY MUSIC)

02:29.040 --> 02:31.640
Maybe it’s time to let the little guy go.

02:31.840 --> 02:36.000
I take care of Flynn,
that’s just the way it is.

02:36.120 --> 02:39.800
Well, Bridget dear?

02:39.960 --> 02:42.000
How is it coming along?

02:43.320 --> 02:45.440
I’d get yourself a flashlight.

02:45.560 --> 02:47.120
(METAL CRASHING)

02:47.320 --> 02:50.000
You can’t fix it?

02:50.120 --> 02:52.200
But you’re the Supreme.

02:52.400 --> 02:56.280
Without golden thread,
there’s nothing I can do.

02:56.440 --> 03:01.680
Then thread you shall have.
Tell me where to find the spider.

03:03.520 --> 03:05.400
I would tell you if I knew.

03:05.520 --> 03:10.000
Remember we have your essence, Bridget.

03:14.560 --> 03:17.160
Where is the spider?

03:19.480 --> 03:22.400
Cameron.

03:23.400 --> 03:25.800
It belongs to Cameron.

03:29.440 --> 03:31.200
This should be fun.

03:34.960 --> 03:36.840
Flynn’s your friend. I get it.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.480
No, it’s more than that.

03:40.640 --> 03:43.800
We’re connected. I can’t just cut him off.

03:45.480 --> 03:48.960
Though, it was magic
that took my mother away.

03:49.080 --> 03:51.640
And magic that destroyed Bridget.

03:51.840 --> 03:54.040
And if you’re always connected...

03:55.400 --> 03:59.960
What if you set him free,
where no one could find him. Except you.

04:00.080 --> 04:01.760
Sorry!

04:06.480 --> 04:09.800
You alright, buddy?
He’s okay.

04:09.960 --> 04:12.920
You know, maybe he can look after himself.

04:14.360 --> 04:15.760
Alright.

04:16.760 --> 04:20.320
Let’s do it.
Now? It’s almost time for Doyle.

04:20.480 --> 04:23.080
Come on. No more magic.

04:25.560 --> 04:27.400
No more magic.

04:39.120 --> 04:43.320
(SIGHS)
So that’s it.

04:55.280 --> 04:59.160
There you go, buddy. You’ll be safe here.

04:59.360 --> 05:03.200
Now go on. Scoot.

05:05.880 --> 05:09.840
What was that?

05:10.000 --> 05:12.920
He bit me. It’s just Flynn’s high five.

05:13.040 --> 05:17.640
It’s his way of saying goodbye.
Isn’t it, boy?

05:32.800 --> 05:35.680
Got you!
Yeah, you got me.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.560
You were looking for this, weren’t you?

05:44.120 --> 05:45.800
One perfect pearlwort.

05:45.960 --> 05:47.840
You beat me to it.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.840
"The pearlwort flowers just once a year,

05:51.000 --> 05:52.880
and makes a person disappear."

05:53.000 --> 05:57.040
You see?
You and me can be indivisible, Jakey-boy.

05:57.200 --> 05:59.480
You mean invisible.

05:59.640 --> 06:02.960
All we need now is some goatnip,
and one hair of a winkstoat

06:03.080 --> 06:05.400
and we can be completely invisible.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.640
Better luck next year.

06:09.960 --> 06:12.320
What even is a winkstoat?

06:26.080 --> 06:29.400
Morning, everyone!
(ALL) Morning.

06:29.520 --> 06:33.920
I’m sure you all realize that
it’s that magical time of year again.

06:34.040 --> 06:37.880
Time for Spellbound,

06:38.000 --> 06:40.200
our annual spelling bee.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.400
As usual, please enter in teams of two,

06:43.520 --> 06:46.120
if you want a chance
to win our fantastic prize:

06:46.320 --> 06:52.120
the Spellbound Trophy,
and a feast for two at the village store.

06:52.320 --> 06:53.440
(ALL IN AWE)

06:53.560 --> 06:58.600
Hey. Do you think we’d be good together?
As a team. For the bee.

06:58.800 --> 07:02.760
What do you say? Please?
Sure, yeah, why not?

07:03.760 --> 07:06.000
Hey, Cam, you wanna team up?

07:06.160 --> 07:11.800
Oh, I --
Cameron and I are entering together.

07:11.960 --> 07:16.000
If that’s okay with you?
Right. Sure!

07:16.120 --> 07:19.040
That sounds ideal.
Hey...

07:20.640 --> 07:23.160
Otto! What are you doing here?

07:23.360 --> 07:25.160
Team up with me?

07:25.360 --> 07:26.920
I don’t want to brag,
but...

07:27.040 --> 07:30.320
I’ve got a thousand years
more experience than you lot. So?

07:30.480 --> 07:33.160
I wouldn’t bother.
Sorsh and I will ace it.

07:33.360 --> 07:37.080
Since winning the Bee also guarantees
an A in English,

07:37.280 --> 07:41.680
I’d strongly advise you enter,
if you need an extra credit.

07:41.880 --> 07:46.200
Okay. I’m in.
I could really do with that A grade.

07:46.400 --> 07:49.920
Really?
Yeah, yeah.

07:50.040 --> 07:52.600
Let’s win this thing.

07:56.320 --> 07:58.760
You’re not actually going to drink that?

07:59.760 --> 08:02.440
Of course you are.

08:02.560 --> 08:05.640
Delicious! Your turn.

08:05.840 --> 08:08.880
I don’t think so.
If you’re too scared to taste a drink

08:09.000 --> 08:11.440
Evermoorian babies
have had for centuries...

08:11.560 --> 08:13.400
Oh, go on, then!

08:17.440 --> 08:21.440
You can really taste the goat
in the goatnip.

08:22.600 --> 08:25.760
It’s working! I can feel it.

08:26.800 --> 08:28.200
I’m invisible!

08:28.360 --> 08:30.920
You look pretty visible to me.

08:31.040 --> 08:34.000
Only because you’re invisible, too!
Don’t you see?

08:34.120 --> 08:36.080
The world is our lobster!

08:36.240 --> 08:38.960
That’s really not a phrase.

08:39.080 --> 08:41.320
Watch this...

08:44.800 --> 08:50.520
Floating dog biscuits!
Floating dog biscuits!

08:50.680 --> 08:55.960
Yeah, I’m not sure you’re making the most
out of invisibility.

08:57.640 --> 09:03.120
You’re right! Come on,
this'll be the heist of the century.

09:06.920 --> 09:09.360
Spin for your mistress.

09:09.560 --> 09:12.440
Your thread
will make our lantern whole again.

09:12.640 --> 09:15.960
And our sister can finally be free
to join us.

09:16.080 --> 09:20.040
Go on, little one, don’t be shy.

09:20.200 --> 09:22.200
What’s wrong with it?

09:22.360 --> 09:25.400
He only spins for his master.

09:25.600 --> 09:29.360
Then we have no further use for it.
Don’t!

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
The boy and spider are linked!
Hurt one, hurt the other.

09:34.160 --> 09:35.720
So?

09:37.000 --> 09:41.680
Remember, Bridget, with your essence
we can force it out of you.

09:44.560 --> 09:47.880
You can still use the spider...
Go on.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.080
There’s an old spell.

09:50.240 --> 09:53.680
You can use its venom
to create a second spider,

09:53.840 --> 09:56.800
with its own magical thread.
(GRIM MUSIC)

09:56.960 --> 10:01.880
It would spin for you,
and you would be its mistress.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.520
And it could mend our lantern?

10:06.360 --> 10:08.800
Lead the way.

10:08.960 --> 10:15.680
Welcome to Spellbound, where six teams
pit their wits for the best trophy,

10:15.840 --> 10:21.760
the best grades, and the best night out
in Evermoor you could imagine.

10:21.920 --> 10:26.560
And for the runners up,
this modest hamper of local delicacies.

10:26.720 --> 10:31.720
Naturally, only traditional Evermoorian
spellings will be allowed.

10:31.880 --> 10:35.720
So if anyone wants to leave now...

10:37.120 --> 10:42.960
Then without further ado, let’s begin
with our first contestant, Sorsha Doyle.

10:48.800 --> 10:52.080
Your first word, Sorsha, is candle.

10:52.240 --> 10:57.360
Candle. K.A.N.D.E.L.

10:57.560 --> 10:58.960
Candle.

10:59.080 --> 11:01.880
Correct! That’s how it’s done.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.800
Traditional spellings only, folks.

11:04.960 --> 11:08.400
Next up, Cameron of the Bee-lievers.

11:13.440 --> 11:18.080
Cameron, your first word is ‘frog’.

11:19.520 --> 11:22.120

11:25.680 --> 11:28.320
From this drop of spider venom...

11:28.520 --> 11:31.520
A new creature will be born.

11:31.680 --> 11:37.000

This is it.
We’re invisible, we’re invincible.

That hamper will be ours!

13:31.720 --> 13:34.840
I dunno what you see in him.
Did you see him up there?

13:35.000 --> 13:36.600
If you don’t know, admit it.

13:36.760 --> 13:39.080
And he picked Bella to be his partner.

13:39.240 --> 13:40.880
Mom!
I’m sorry, honey.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.600
Ever since you met him,
you've been different.

13:43.760 --> 13:46.320
And without him,
you’re doing pretty well.

It’s my life. I can choose my own friends
Of course you can.

13:50.240 --> 13:53.320

out of the drain.

17:02.280 --> 17:04.880
He’s in here. But I can’t move!

17:06.920 --> 17:08.600
Sew something, Tara!

17:10.360 --> 17:13.000
I gave it all away! My powers..

17:13.160 --> 17:15.160
The thread...
Tara. Hurry.

17:18.200 --> 17:21.200
(DISTORTED SPELL NOISE)
I did it!

17:23.240 --> 17:27.920
Flynn! It’s alright, buddy. I’m here now.

17:33.240 --> 17:36.600
How did you do that?
It just happened.

17:38.680 --> 17:42.600
I thought I’d lost you.
Never. Promise.

17:49.880 --> 17:51.160
(DOOR OPENS)

17:54.520 --> 17:58.960
Run along, Tara.
Nothing to see here...

18:02.280 --> 18:08.840
It worked. We have our own spider...
Now spin, my dark creation.

18:10.440 --> 18:14.120
Your thread is so precious.

18:15.960 --> 18:19.760
Congratulations, Champion.

18:19.920 --> 18:22.000
Thank you, father.

18:22.120 --> 18:25.680
But we only won
because everyone else was disqualified.

18:25.840 --> 18:27.840
And it wasn’t just me.

18:28.000 --> 18:31.680
So, the grand prize.

18:31.840 --> 18:34.120
The feast will begin tomorrow, 8am.

18:34.280 --> 18:37.600
Y-you mean, in the evening.
No, no, no, no, in the morning.

18:37.760 --> 18:41.200
First you will pick the harvest fruits,
on the edge of the bog.

18:41.360 --> 18:47.440
That should keep you busy until evening,
when I shall welcome you to the store.

18:47.640 --> 18:49.800
Hang on, you’re welcoming us?

18:49.960 --> 18:53.400
But of course!
Every feast needs its feast master!

18:53.600 --> 18:57.280
And talking of feasts...

19:01.280 --> 19:03.000
Unbelievable...

19:03.120 --> 19:05.880
"Now you see me."

19:06.880 --> 19:09.360
Now you don’t!
Enjoying yourselves?

19:09.560 --> 19:12.720
There’s no-one here.

19:12.880 --> 19:15.320
You two may not have earned this prize.

19:15.520 --> 19:19.800
But since you’re enjoying it so much,
you should keep it.

19:19.960 --> 19:22.000
Thanks, Mr. Doyle.

19:22.120 --> 19:23.760
Bring your haul to the store,

19:23.920 --> 19:27.400
and you shall eat your way
through the entire hamper.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.960
You shall not leave until you’re finished.

19:34.640 --> 19:36.040
So, got the grand prize?

19:36.200 --> 19:39.000
That’s one way of describing it.
Are you alright?

19:39.120 --> 19:40.880
Thanks to Tara.

19:47.240 --> 19:51.040
I’m sorry. I’m going to make up for it,
and study so hard --

19:51.200 --> 19:55.400
Yes, you are. Because from now on,
there’ll be no more Cameron.

19:55.600 --> 19:57.720
But --
That’s final, kiddo.

20:04.400 --> 20:06.880
Well done, my creature.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.840
Now we will see the power of your thread.

20:12.800 --> 20:14.640
(LANTERN CLANKING)

20:16.440 --> 20:20.800
(SPARKS)

20:20.960 --> 20:25.280
(THUNDER RUMBLES)

20:25.440 --> 20:30.000
For a thousand years,
this lantern gave out light.

20:30.160 --> 20:34.120
But it is changed.
(SINISTER MUSIC)

20:34.280 --> 20:38.120
Changed how?
It is full of darkness.

20:40.440 --> 20:45.800
If the fated one touches the lantern,
your sister will be freed.

20:47.320 --> 20:49.600
But be warned.

20:49.760 --> 20:55.760
Anyone else who touches it will die.

20:57.880 --> 21:00.680
Next time on Evermoor Chronicles...

21:00.840 --> 21:04.160
Looks like spider magic.
I should call her Mary.

21:04.320 --> 21:06.920
This web,
it's done something to my watch.

21:07.040 --> 21:09.560
I'd do anything to wind back the clock

21:09.720 --> 21:12.880
Passing notes in class?
Would you like to share it with us?

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
What's with the poetry
about Cameron?

21:15.160 --> 21:17.360
Did you rip any sheets? Then we predict.

21:17.560 --> 21:19.920
What have I done?
