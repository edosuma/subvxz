00:02.336 --> 00:05.955
<i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

00:06.465 --> 00:09.128
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

00:09.510 --> 00:12.378
<i>but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R Labs,</i>

00:12.596 --> 00:14.929
<i>I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.</i>

00:15.599 --> 00:17.181
<i>But I became lost in time.</i>

00:17.518 --> 00:20.056
<i>It took everything in my friends'
power to bring me back.</i>

00:20.437 --> 00:23.350
<i>And in doing so, our world
was opened up to new threats.</i>

00:23.565 --> 00:25.852
<i>And I'm the only one fast enough
to stop them.</i>

00:26.151 --> 00:28.143
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

00:29.571 --> 00:30.857
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

00:31.323 --> 00:32.905
I didn't kill Clifford DeVoe.

00:33.325 --> 00:34.315
Tricked ya.

00:34.409 --> 00:35.399
<i>Barry, they took a hostage.</i>

00:35.786 --> 00:37.027
<i>- Who did he take?
- Your dad.</i>

00:37.120 --> 00:38.281
I'm ready for my super-suit.

00:38.580 --> 00:40.492
This "tarp" is your super-suit.

00:40.916 --> 00:42.782
What is this? A puppy's raincoat?

00:44.336 --> 00:45.577
Nice job, rookie.

00:46.171 --> 00:47.161
I won't be a fugitive.

00:47.256 --> 00:48.542
If I'm convicted, I'm not gonna run.

00:49.132 --> 00:50.794
<i>We find the defendant guilty.</i>

01:10.571 --> 01:12.403
We're losing control!
Deploy smoke grenades!

01:12.864 --> 01:14.025
<i>Deploy smoke grenades!</i>

01:16.243 --> 01:17.450
<i>We need backup!</i>

01:32.801 --> 01:34.793
They're back in! Lock it down!

01:38.682 --> 01:39.763
Let's move. Move out.

02:05.334 --> 02:07.701
Fine. Just tell us what you want.

02:08.711 --> 02:11.830
<i>I want you to back off
or I will detonate this thing!</i>

02:11.923 --> 02:14.461
Okay, calm down.
Nobody needs to get hurt today.

02:14.885 --> 02:16.296
<i>You just follow instructions</i>

02:16.386 --> 02:19.550
and everybody here gets to live to
see the sunshine tomorrow, all right?

02:20.098 --> 02:22.010
And I better not
see the Flash either.

02:22.434 --> 02:23.595
All right!

02:23.685 --> 02:25.551
First, I want a car!

02:25.812 --> 02:27.269
Something eco-friendly.

02:27.356 --> 02:28.972
Like a... Like a Prius.

02:29.775 --> 02:31.892
- Okay, we can do that.
- Good.

02:34.488 --> 02:35.569
<i>Right.</i>

02:35.822 --> 02:36.812
<i>Now, second...</i>

02:37.741 --> 02:40.449
I want a plane, okay?
A private plane.

02:41.203 --> 02:42.239
<i>Okay?</i>

02:42.829 --> 02:44.320
And a salad, all right?

02:44.414 --> 02:46.155
- I'm counting calories.
- Okay.

02:46.625 --> 02:48.116
It's gonna take us
an hour to arrange that.

02:48.210 --> 02:49.246
You better hurry up,

02:49.586 --> 02:51.578
'cause these hostages
don't have much time.

03:00.305 --> 03:02.012
Should've gone with a steak, pal.

03:03.850 --> 03:05.637
'Cause it's the last
decent meal you're getting

03:05.727 --> 03:07.593
for the next five to 10 years.

03:10.482 --> 03:11.689
Who the hell are you?

03:12.067 --> 03:13.774
Your friendly
neighborhood superhero.

03:14.361 --> 03:15.943
You can call me...

03:17.572 --> 03:18.779
Mr...

03:20.492 --> 03:22.028
One second.

03:22.119 --> 03:24.736
Guys, this is a huge moment for me.
What's my name?

03:28.083 --> 03:30.291
I was wondering where
you were going with that.

03:30.877 --> 03:32.914
Hey, hey, where are my hostages?

03:33.296 --> 03:36.255
Ah... Bathroom break.
They just couldn't hold it anymore.

03:36.341 --> 03:38.003
Don't worry, though.
They're totally safe.

03:38.093 --> 03:39.880
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Get back, freak!

03:40.095 --> 03:41.085
"Freak"?

03:41.179 --> 03:44.638
Oh, sticks and stones
may break my bones, buddy.

03:44.850 --> 03:46.762
Well, they used to. Not anymore.

03:46.852 --> 03:48.138
I'll blow this whole city block.

03:48.228 --> 03:51.187
Ah... You do realize
you're a part of that block, right?

03:51.648 --> 03:53.230
Come on, man, it's a weekday.

03:53.316 --> 03:56.309
People just wanna get off work,
go home, watch the boob tube.

03:56.403 --> 03:57.644
So why don't you
take off that vest and...

03:57.904 --> 03:58.894
Don't touch me!

04:10.250 --> 04:11.536
Ralph, are you okay?

04:17.298 --> 04:20.291
Yeah, just wicked heartburn.

04:24.973 --> 04:27.761
<i>Let this be a lesson to all of you
would-be criminals out there.</i>

04:27.851 --> 04:30.969
<i>Catching you won't be
too much of a stretch.</i>

04:33.857 --> 04:35.814
<i>And so, our streets are safe again,</i>

04:35.901 --> 04:39.861
<i>thanks to Central City's
funniest new hero, the Stretchy Man.</i>

04:41.239 --> 04:42.229
<i>Okay.</i>

04:42.657 --> 04:43.647
Embarrassing.

04:43.909 --> 04:45.821
Cisco, next time
you're going with him.

04:46.203 --> 04:48.820
Iris, a chicken needs to
leave its roost sooner or later,

04:48.914 --> 04:51.873
especially when that chicken insists
on doing his own solo mission.

04:51.958 --> 04:53.915
- This is bad.
- This is really bad.

04:54.169 --> 04:55.785
"Stretchy Man."
That's a terrible name.

04:55.962 --> 04:57.874
Also, now that
I'm gonna be on TV all the time,

04:57.964 --> 04:59.796
this gray suit gotta go.

04:59.883 --> 05:01.294
Hey. Easy, chickadee.

05:01.676 --> 05:03.713
<i>No, Ralph, I meant you, okay?</i>

05:03.804 --> 05:05.261
That bomb could've
torn you to shreds.

05:05.347 --> 05:07.555
Or Joe, or any of the police outside.

05:07.682 --> 05:11.221
Relax, ladies,
my cells are completely polygamized.

05:12.437 --> 05:14.019
- Polymerized?
- Yeah, that.

05:14.606 --> 05:16.689
Which means they can stretch
and take a bomb blast.

05:16.775 --> 05:20.610
- Oh, my God.
- Dibny is in-dib-structible.

05:20.946 --> 05:22.778
Okay, Ralph,
you are missing the point.

05:22.864 --> 05:24.275
You need to be more cautious.

05:24.407 --> 05:26.148
No, no, no.
You are missing the point.

05:26.243 --> 05:28.781
What I really need, guys,
is a new superhero name.

05:29.204 --> 05:31.821
Ramon, you've had all this time.
You can't come up with anything?

05:31.915 --> 05:34.248
Patience, okay? I'm getting to you.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.541
I've just been a little preoccupied,

05:35.627 --> 05:37.584
what with Barry being in prison
and all!

05:44.427 --> 05:47.340
You find anything that might prove
DeVoe framed Barry yet?

05:49.140 --> 05:50.472
My dad and Cecile are meeting

05:50.559 --> 05:52.425
with Judge Hankerson tomorrow
to go over his appeal.

05:52.519 --> 05:55.853
We've been poring through the
evidence piece-by-piece, but...

05:56.398 --> 05:57.639
Don't worry, Iris,
we're gonna get him out.

05:59.651 --> 06:00.812
<i>Hey, has Barry joined a gang yet?</i>

06:01.069 --> 06:03.311
I got some friends on the inside,
I can make some calls.

06:04.281 --> 06:05.317
Shut up, Ralph.

06:08.952 --> 06:09.942
Okay.

06:10.996 --> 06:12.703
I will stop helping now.

06:25.594 --> 06:28.587
You can watch the clock all you want,
but it won't go any faster.

06:29.472 --> 06:30.883
You're Barry Allen, right?

06:30.974 --> 06:32.135
Henry Allen's kid?

06:32.392 --> 06:33.974
- I'm...
- Axel Walker.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.890
You and your dad
kidnapped my dad once.

06:37.063 --> 06:38.224
Yeah. Right.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.107
Pudding?

06:41.192 --> 06:43.434
Lunch lady gave me extra.
I think she has a crush on me.

06:45.822 --> 06:48.815
Hey, word on the block is
you carved up some professor.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.616
He give you a bad grade or something?

06:51.995 --> 06:53.236
I didn't kill anybody.

06:53.788 --> 06:54.824
Yeah, sure.

06:55.081 --> 06:56.071
Everyone's innocent in here.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.741
Especially that guy.

06:59.294 --> 07:00.660
Yeah, Big Sir.

07:01.212 --> 07:02.293
He's really innocent.

07:04.716 --> 07:06.958
This is grosser than usual.
Does pudding go bad?

07:07.802 --> 07:09.293
Axel, what do you want from me?

07:12.557 --> 07:13.798
To be murder buds.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.096
You know,
we could share trade secrets.

07:16.728 --> 07:19.095
I'd love to hear how you
carved up that college quack.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.433
I don't need any friends in here.

07:21.858 --> 07:23.440
Man, I do not feel good.

07:36.247 --> 07:37.283
Get him up.

07:40.210 --> 07:42.998
You got mud on my bright whites.

07:43.213 --> 07:44.749
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

07:44.923 --> 07:46.334
"Sorry" is right.

07:54.099 --> 07:56.637
First week in Iron Heights
is often the hardest, Mr. Allen.

07:57.811 --> 08:00.474
You've already seen what happens
when a few inmates try to revolt.

08:01.064 --> 08:03.056
<i>Acclimating to your new life
will take time.</i>

08:03.483 --> 08:04.644
<i>Always does.</i>

08:05.110 --> 08:06.396
<i>In the meantime,</i>

08:07.278 --> 08:09.110
do your best to stay clean in here.

08:11.658 --> 08:12.774
Oh, and Mr. Allen?

08:13.201 --> 08:14.658
Your 1:30 is waiting for you.

08:29.718 --> 08:30.708
Hey.

08:30.885 --> 08:32.876
- I'm so glad to see you.
- Me, too.

08:35.181 --> 08:36.217
How's it going?

08:36.890 --> 08:38.506
It's not as bad as
I thought it would be.

08:38.934 --> 08:40.801
And, hey, you're talking to
the newest member

08:40.895 --> 08:42.135
of the Iron Heights janitorial staff.

08:42.230 --> 08:43.471
I'm the fastest mop alive.

08:46.735 --> 08:49.853
Well, we've been
surveilling the DeVoes 24/7.

08:49.946 --> 08:52.154
I mean, they must have
made a mistake somewhere, right?

08:52.240 --> 08:55.074
And I've been poring over
all of the evidence with Dad.

08:55.493 --> 08:56.609
We are gonna get you
out of there, Barry.

08:56.786 --> 08:57.947
I know you will.

08:58.747 --> 09:01.205
How's the rest of the team?
I saw Ralph on TV.

09:02.459 --> 09:03.700
Ralph is...

09:04.836 --> 09:05.826
Getting a little cocky.

09:06.379 --> 09:09.042
Yeah. I was when I started, too.
It happens.

09:10.216 --> 09:11.297
Yeah.

09:12.844 --> 09:13.960
Iris, it's okay.

09:15.889 --> 09:18.256
I just can't believe
this is our new normal, Barry.

09:20.685 --> 09:21.846
I don't want this to be our lives.

09:22.979 --> 09:25.062
You're gonna find something.
I know it.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.308
Closing time!

09:28.401 --> 09:29.391
Wrap 'em up!

09:30.361 --> 09:31.977
I just wish
I could touch your hand again.

09:38.411 --> 09:39.447
You will.

09:41.956 --> 09:42.946
I promise.

09:44.501 --> 09:45.537
I'll see you tomorrow?

09:45.752 --> 09:46.833
Every tomorrow.

10:08.858 --> 10:11.521
Walker here
spewed all over his cellmate.

10:11.736 --> 10:13.398
Says he's got cramps.

10:15.782 --> 10:17.239
Who are you? Where's Nurse Hill?

10:17.325 --> 10:19.988
Out sick.
Looks like he ate the pudding.

10:21.079 --> 10:22.320
Yeah. How do you know that?

10:27.836 --> 10:29.247
Because I'm the one who sent it.

10:31.089 --> 10:33.456
Come on, Axel. Let's go.

10:34.467 --> 10:35.548
Mom?

10:43.977 --> 10:45.559
Walker and the nurse
used tranquilizers

10:45.645 --> 10:47.136
on two more guards on their way out.

10:47.230 --> 10:49.847
And nothing tipped you off
that this nurse might be a criminal?

10:49.941 --> 10:51.273
Her background check was clean.

10:51.359 --> 10:52.691
She said her name
was Lindsay Fineheart.

10:52.777 --> 10:54.518
<i>She was sent over
by our staffing company.</i>

10:54.612 --> 10:58.151
I'm gonna need the hard drive
of the surveillance footage

10:58.241 --> 11:00.278
from the security cameras
in the infirmary.

11:00.368 --> 11:02.610
Well, unfortunately,
we're still analog here in gen pop.

11:02.704 --> 11:03.740
It'll take a while to dub the tapes.

11:04.122 --> 11:05.112
In the meantime,

11:05.206 --> 11:06.822
I'm having Fineheart's file
brought down for you.

11:10.837 --> 11:12.248
How's Barry doing?

11:13.423 --> 11:15.710
He's a model inmate.
Just like his dad.

11:16.467 --> 11:17.708
- Do you mind if I...
- No.

11:17.802 --> 11:19.009
Let me check on that file.

11:22.932 --> 11:23.922
<i>Barr.</i>

11:25.935 --> 11:27.972
Joe. Hey!

11:30.231 --> 11:31.392
What are you doing here?

11:31.482 --> 11:34.600
Axel Walker escaped.
Some new nurse helped him get out.

11:36.321 --> 11:37.732
He was in here
because of the pudding.

11:37.822 --> 11:40.986
- How do you know that?
- He was complaining about the taste.

11:41.075 --> 11:42.611
Hey, let me help with this,
all right?

11:42.702 --> 11:43.783
- Barry.
- No...

11:43.870 --> 11:46.533
Is Cisco having any luck figuring out
how to bypass the system?

11:46.623 --> 11:48.910
Once he does that I can phase out
of here. I can help you track him.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.662
Barry, you need to stay put for now.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.667
Trickster is just
a messed-up kid.

11:52.754 --> 11:53.744
We can handle him.

11:53.838 --> 11:55.875
No, I know, of course. I just...

11:56.507 --> 11:58.339
I'm already tired of feeling useless,
you know?

11:58.426 --> 12:00.759
The only thing you should focus on
in here is watching your back.

12:03.264 --> 12:06.257
Pretty sure
cops can't touch inmates, so...

12:06.351 --> 12:07.592
Otherwise, I'd give you a hug.

12:09.270 --> 12:10.260
Stay strong, Barr.

12:10.480 --> 12:11.766
Mmm-hmm.

12:11.856 --> 12:13.768
- Detective.
- Sir.

12:14.567 --> 12:17.025
Well, this is her.

12:19.614 --> 12:21.480
This woman's name
isn't Lindsay Fineheart.

12:21.783 --> 12:23.570
Her name is Zoey Clark.

12:23.993 --> 12:25.734
James Jesse had a girlfriend?

12:25.828 --> 12:27.660
Yeah. She called herself "Prank."

12:27.747 --> 12:31.411
Back in the day,
she was Bonnie to Jesse's Clyde.

12:31.501 --> 12:33.959
No matter what,
whether it was attempted murder,

12:34.045 --> 12:36.833
arson, robbery,
she was always by his side.

12:39.050 --> 12:41.758
Man! What were people wearing
back then?

12:41.844 --> 12:45.087
Zoey Clark was the beneficiary
to Clarx Toys' empire.

12:45.181 --> 12:47.798
Not much of an empire.
All those stores closed 20 years ago.

12:47.892 --> 12:50.259
Looks like she has Bachelor's degrees
in Arts and Applied Sciences

12:50.353 --> 12:51.889
as well as a Masters in Chemistry.

12:52.730 --> 12:55.347
"Trickster and Prank were responsible
for a series of terrorist attacks

12:55.441 --> 12:57.307
"across Central City,
including the destruction of...

12:58.319 --> 13:00.902
"The Gadzooka Bubblegum Company."

13:01.656 --> 13:04.444
I always wondered why my favorite gum
suddenly disappeared in the '90s.

13:04.617 --> 13:05.858
I have it on my Earth.

13:06.035 --> 13:08.118
- You do not.
- I just said we did.

13:08.204 --> 13:09.411
- You do not.
- We do.

13:09.497 --> 13:11.955
Anyway, after Jesse was arrested,
she disappeared.

13:12.041 --> 13:13.452
She's been a fugitive ever since.

13:13.543 --> 13:16.001
Looks like Axel was born nine months
after Zoey was last seen.

13:16.087 --> 13:17.794
I bet she left town
to take care of her son.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.212
And she came back
to bust him out of prison

13:19.299 --> 13:20.540
and pick up where she left off.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.465
Well, I'm digging into C.C.P.D. files

13:22.552 --> 13:24.384
to see if she had
any other known associates.

13:24.470 --> 13:26.587
I'll set the satellite
to do a search grid. Ramon.

13:26.681 --> 13:28.513
Hey, how about you hook me up
with some of that gum?

13:28.599 --> 13:30.716
- Why don't you breach yourself?
- Sounds like an insult.

13:30.810 --> 13:31.800
Kind of was.

13:31.894 --> 13:34.682
Hey, Ralph,
do you wanna go to your usual spots,

13:34.772 --> 13:36.308
see if any of your contacts
have seen her?

13:36.399 --> 13:38.766
Sure. Need a chaperone.
Caitlin, you're up.

13:38.860 --> 13:40.146
It's happy hour. You're buying.

13:40.236 --> 13:41.898
Come on.
Use Killer Frost's credit card.

13:41.988 --> 13:43.729
- No way, Jose.
- You think Ralphy's made of money?

13:48.244 --> 13:50.327
Where are you two hiding?

13:52.498 --> 13:53.579
<i>Wow!</i>

13:55.376 --> 13:56.742
What is this place?

13:57.086 --> 13:59.669
- It's all that remains of Clarx Toys.
- Oh!

13:59.964 --> 14:01.546
It's cold in here.

14:04.344 --> 14:05.880
Oh, awesome!

14:07.430 --> 14:08.420
<i>I made the news!</i>

14:09.140 --> 14:11.928
Not "awesome."
Now the police are looking for you.

14:12.018 --> 14:14.726
As soon as night falls,
we're out of Central City.

14:14.812 --> 14:16.223
And then
we'll go meet up with Dad, right?

14:17.565 --> 14:18.806
That's why you broke me out.

14:18.900 --> 14:20.107
Because Dad wanted to see me, right?

14:20.193 --> 14:21.775
Not exactly.

14:22.278 --> 14:24.019
Axel, I wanted you back in my life.

14:24.405 --> 14:26.613
Right, but what about Dad?

14:27.325 --> 14:30.238
Well, he broke out a year ago,
and he hasn't come looking for you...

14:31.037 --> 14:32.323
He doesn't care.

14:33.456 --> 14:34.617
Of course he does.

14:35.833 --> 14:37.495
Axel, your dad's a deadbeat.

14:37.668 --> 14:40.376
He doesn't want to be a part
of this family and he never did.

14:44.050 --> 14:45.086
Don't talk about him like that.

14:47.261 --> 14:49.674
Honey, I'm sorry, it's just that...

14:49.764 --> 14:51.721
You just don't know him like I do.

14:53.684 --> 14:56.176
Do you know what it was like for me
when you were growing up?

14:57.522 --> 14:59.980
While you were idolizing your dad,

15:00.691 --> 15:02.648
I was the one making your dinner.

15:03.653 --> 15:06.737
While you were watching him
terrorize the city on TV,

15:07.448 --> 15:09.656
I was the one driving you to school.

15:09.742 --> 15:12.280
I was the one making sure
you got your homework done.

15:12.370 --> 15:14.407
I was the one packing
the lunches in the morning.

15:14.497 --> 15:16.409
- I was there for you.
- I know. I know, Mom!

15:16.999 --> 15:18.581
Okay? Now we can get him back.

15:18.876 --> 15:20.208
I don't want him back.

15:20.878 --> 15:23.245
I want us to go be free together.

15:25.633 --> 15:28.250
I never wanted you
to end up like your father.

15:28.803 --> 15:30.886
Well, it's too late for that, Mom.

15:33.683 --> 15:35.549
I just need to get Dad's attention.

15:36.352 --> 15:38.685
I'll show him that someone in
this family still has a funny bone,

15:39.105 --> 15:40.141
Mom.

15:48.239 --> 15:49.650
<i>...everyone walks away safe.</i>

15:49.740 --> 15:53.734
<i>And so, Central City has a new,
sexier model of superhero.</i>

15:55.371 --> 15:56.703
<i>Me, kids.</i>

15:57.081 --> 15:58.663
And I know just how I'm gonna do it.

16:00.042 --> 16:01.032
I'm the sexy model.

16:01.669 --> 16:03.661
<i>Anyone want an autograph?
Autograph, anyone?</i>

16:04.755 --> 16:06.792
No, Axel. Axel!

16:07.258 --> 16:08.669
Axel!

16:14.640 --> 16:17.758
Heard you had a little one-on-one
time with a badge this morning.

16:17.852 --> 16:19.218
Oh, God.

16:22.148 --> 16:24.891
First, you dirty up my shoes.

16:26.402 --> 16:28.860
Now, you're snitching to the cops?

16:28.946 --> 16:30.562
<i>You've had quite the first week,
haven't you?</i>

16:31.073 --> 16:32.314
I don't want any trouble.

16:32.658 --> 16:33.819
Too late.

16:50.301 --> 16:51.587
This isn't over!

16:56.349 --> 16:57.590
Thanks.

17:02.396 --> 17:04.137
Hey, how's the search coming?

17:04.232 --> 17:06.565
Harry and I
already set all the parameters.

17:06.651 --> 17:09.189
Just got 300 square miles
to comb through. So...

17:09.278 --> 17:10.268
Yeah.

17:11.821 --> 17:14.609
- That's not good.
<i>- Hello, Central City!</i>

17:14.700 --> 17:19.694
It's been far, far too long since my
beautiful face graced your screens.

17:21.915 --> 17:23.452
This kid's got a face for radio.

17:23.542 --> 17:25.579
Trickster's hijacking
the city's broadcasting signals.

17:25.670 --> 17:28.583
Today, we're going to play
a little game I like to call,

17:28.673 --> 17:31.381
"What does this do?"

17:32.343 --> 17:34.130
<i>Looks like a regular old bouncy ball.</i>

17:34.220 --> 17:35.882
But what does this do?

17:35.972 --> 17:37.383
- Cisco.
- Tracing.

17:37.473 --> 17:38.805
<i>Let's find out!</i>

17:38.891 --> 17:41.599
If and when
you throw it hard enough...

17:54.448 --> 17:56.360
<i>Kaboom!</i>

17:57.743 --> 17:59.655
He's downtown.
Corner of Demeo and Bilson.

17:59.870 --> 18:03.864
Bring me the Stretchy Man.
Or else you're gonna go "boom-boom."

18:04.083 --> 18:06.996
My first supervillain
Thunderdome challenge.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.702
This is awesome!

18:08.796 --> 18:10.913
Ralph, you do not know this guy.
He's dangerous.

18:11.257 --> 18:14.500
He's throwing bouncy balls
and wearing a bedazzled peacoat.

18:14.594 --> 18:15.880
I got this.

18:18.973 --> 18:20.589
Still haven't taken that off, huh?

18:20.975 --> 18:22.216
I sleep in this.

18:23.769 --> 18:25.886
You mind breaching me there?
It's a lot faster.

18:29.317 --> 18:31.183
Where are you, Stretchy Man?

18:31.360 --> 18:33.773
I've got plenty more
where that came from.

18:34.196 --> 18:35.778
Nice suit, Fall Out Boy.

18:36.490 --> 18:37.697
Yuck.

18:38.075 --> 18:39.532
Yours could use some work.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.906
Oh, look at that cutting wit.

18:42.163 --> 18:44.029
You wanted me, here I am.

18:44.123 --> 18:47.707
Great. Do want to play, uh, catch?

18:54.592 --> 18:56.584
You're really blowing this
supervillain fight.

18:56.761 --> 18:58.468
Well, it's my Central City
return party.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.220
And your death will make me a star.

19:06.270 --> 19:07.260
Child's play.

19:08.064 --> 19:09.430
Okay. All right.

19:09.607 --> 19:12.600
This is what I call
the "Hurty-Squirty Gun."

19:19.867 --> 19:21.108
Tricked ya!

19:21.827 --> 19:24.945
It's acid,
with a little ingredient X.

19:25.039 --> 19:26.996
I call it "axid."

19:28.584 --> 19:30.576
He's panicking.
His heart rate is off the charts.

19:30.670 --> 19:31.751
Ralph, are you okay?

19:31.837 --> 19:34.124
Help!

19:34.423 --> 19:36.836
Burn, Stretchy Man. Burn!

19:44.392 --> 19:45.553
Not today, Satan.

19:50.147 --> 19:51.979
What the hell did he do to me?

20:04.161 --> 20:05.402
What the hell was that stuff?

20:05.496 --> 20:07.078
Looks like Axel
created some sort of super acid.

20:07.164 --> 20:09.076
Yeah, it's got a pH level
in the negative 50s,

20:09.166 --> 20:10.657
and all it did
was burn through your skin?

20:11.252 --> 20:12.368
If it were anybody else, it would

20:12.586 --> 20:14.452
melt right through them
like Xenomorph blood.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.504
- Like in... <i>Aliens.
- Aliens.</i>

20:16.716 --> 20:18.503
But you said my cells
were polymerized.

20:18.592 --> 20:20.584
- No.
- You said nothing could hurt them.

20:20.678 --> 20:21.794
Dibny, I didn't say that.

20:21.887 --> 20:23.879
I said your cells were bonded unlike
anything I've ever seen.

20:23.973 --> 20:25.805
I've never seen acid like this,
and so,

20:25.891 --> 20:27.757
cannot be responsible for things
I have never seen.

20:28.018 --> 20:29.600
- It definitely hurts.
- Mmm-hmm. Of course.

20:29.687 --> 20:31.098
Well, now we know
what your Kryptonite is.

20:32.106 --> 20:33.096
What the hell is Kryptonite?

20:33.357 --> 20:34.564
- What?
- Aw, come on.

20:34.900 --> 20:35.890
Think I'm gonna heal?

20:36.110 --> 20:37.100
- Eventually.
- Probably.

20:37.194 --> 20:38.184
"Probably"?

20:38.821 --> 20:39.937
Well, you know...

20:40.364 --> 20:41.980
I thought I was indestructible.

20:42.366 --> 20:43.356
So did we.

20:44.076 --> 20:45.066
- Get out.
- All right.

20:46.996 --> 20:49.613
Okay, well, Caitlin, you can treat
the wound and manage the pain. Right?

20:49.790 --> 20:50.906
- As needed.
- Okay. Well,

20:51.000 --> 20:51.990
the most important thing is
that you're safe.

20:52.084 --> 20:53.620
Ralph... Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

20:53.961 --> 20:56.999
Um... Axel's still out there.
We should track him down.

20:58.174 --> 20:59.255
Oh, my God.

21:00.259 --> 21:01.249
This might sting a little.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.641
Excuse me. My wife was supposed
to be here a half-hour ago.

21:17.735 --> 21:19.021
Could you see if...

21:20.821 --> 21:21.811
Cool.

21:29.455 --> 21:30.571
Hey.

21:33.667 --> 21:35.249
I was just wondering
why you helped me.

21:38.839 --> 21:40.455
Because your dad helped me.

21:54.271 --> 21:56.979
- Oh, are you okay?
- No, Mom. I'm not.

21:57.358 --> 21:58.690
Stretchy Man's still alive.

21:58.984 --> 22:00.520
All Dad's gonna see is that I failed.

22:00.611 --> 22:01.601
He won't want to see me.

22:03.906 --> 22:05.738
Who am I kidding?
I'll never be like him.

22:06.158 --> 22:08.491
I think you can be
even better than him.

22:09.787 --> 22:11.949
You don't see it, but I do.

22:12.873 --> 22:15.536
You're the real Trickster, Boo-Boo.

22:16.418 --> 22:17.625
What's gotten into you?

22:18.504 --> 22:19.620
Okay, I didn't take my meds.

22:20.631 --> 22:21.621
Mom!

22:22.007 --> 22:22.997
You did that for me?

22:23.092 --> 22:24.754
I would do anything for you, Boo-Boo.

22:26.345 --> 22:27.381
Would you kill with me?

22:27.471 --> 22:29.929
It's like riding a tricycle.
You never forget.

22:30.516 --> 22:32.007
Let's paint the town red.

22:32.977 --> 22:34.263
I know whose blood we should use.

22:34.353 --> 22:37.562
We just need a new trick
to strong-arm Stretch Armstrong.

22:37.731 --> 22:38.721
- No.
- No?

22:38.816 --> 22:40.148
What we need is something better.

22:41.819 --> 22:43.105
Because if there is one thing
I've realized,

22:43.404 --> 22:45.191
it's behind every great trick

22:47.116 --> 22:48.903
is an even better Prank.

22:52.496 --> 22:53.657
Hey, guys.

22:53.914 --> 22:55.075
Any luck finding Trickster?

22:55.165 --> 22:56.952
Joe, geo-tracking is an art form.

22:57.042 --> 23:00.251
It takes precision, it takes finesse,
it takes grace.

23:00.337 --> 23:01.873
It requires none of those things.

23:01.964 --> 23:03.330
Simply the fact that
he's not a meta-human.

23:03.424 --> 23:04.915
Regular humans are harder to track.

23:05.009 --> 23:06.841
Is there anything
you can't suck the fun out of?

23:07.094 --> 23:08.084
Leaf peeping.

23:10.264 --> 23:11.254
Trickster.

23:12.099 --> 23:14.682
<i>Hello again, Central City.</i>

23:15.436 --> 23:18.349
It's time for
the exciting new game show,

23:18.439 --> 23:20.101
"Wheel of Misfortune."

23:20.316 --> 23:23.935
<i>With prizes so amazing,
you'll think you died.</i>

23:24.028 --> 23:25.394
<i>And if you play your cards right,</i>

23:25.487 --> 23:26.898
<i>you just might.</i>

23:26.989 --> 23:27.979
<i>Here's your host,</i>

23:28.073 --> 23:29.609
<i>the murderous matriarch,</i>

23:29.909 --> 23:31.445
Prank.

23:35.372 --> 23:37.739
What do we have in store for tonight?

23:38.125 --> 23:40.458
<i>Well, we have chills, thrills</i>

23:40.544 --> 23:42.160
<i>and plenty of kills.</i>

23:42.254 --> 23:43.916
<i>These guys are
absolutely nuts.</i>

23:44.006 --> 23:47.499
So, why don't
we meet our first contestants?

23:48.385 --> 23:49.421
Ta-da!

23:49.511 --> 23:50.922
Ha-la!

23:51.931 --> 23:53.263
They've got hostages.

23:53.349 --> 23:55.557
<i>Shocking prizes are in store.</i>

23:56.018 --> 23:59.807
But, Prank,
what about the grand prize?

24:00.064 --> 24:02.272
Well, I'm so glad you asked.

24:03.859 --> 24:06.977
Because we have an axid shower.

24:11.617 --> 24:13.700
<i>Oh, no.</i>

24:14.787 --> 24:16.198
Sorry, Mr. Beebo.

24:16.372 --> 24:17.579
Oh...

24:18.123 --> 24:19.659
<i>Beebo loves getting clean.</i>

24:25.673 --> 24:28.711
<i>Beebo has an owie...</i>

24:35.474 --> 24:37.466
- Cisco.
- Triangulating their signal.

24:38.102 --> 24:41.846
We need a special VIP to come down

24:41.939 --> 24:43.726
<i>for our special show.</i>

24:44.274 --> 24:46.186
<i>So, if you're watching,
Stretchy Man,</i>

24:46.276 --> 24:48.643
why don't you come on down
and spin the wheel?

24:48.737 --> 24:50.399
<i>You have one hour</i>

24:50.489 --> 24:52.481
or these nice people die.

24:55.452 --> 24:56.442
There you are.

24:56.537 --> 24:58.574
They're at the old Clarx Toys factory
in Lawrence Hills.

24:59.206 --> 25:01.698
<i>Tick tock, Stretchy Man.
Time's a-wasting.</i>

25:01.792 --> 25:02.873
<i>So let's</i>

25:02.960 --> 25:06.044
spin that wheel!

25:10.175 --> 25:12.667
I'm gonna have
C.C.P.D. create a perimeter

25:12.761 --> 25:14.377
a few blocks away,
so they can't escape.

25:14.471 --> 25:16.758
Harry, how are you coming with
the solvent for Trickster's axid?

25:16.849 --> 25:19.307
Well, slowly. Very difficult
to neutralize a solvent

25:19.393 --> 25:21.635
that hasn't existed until today.

25:22.730 --> 25:24.687
- You got 59 minutes.
- All I need is 58.

25:25.065 --> 25:26.931
Ralph, suit up.

25:30.195 --> 25:31.527
Well, you wanted a new suit,
didn't you?

25:31.739 --> 25:33.071
I even made it pocket-sized.

25:34.491 --> 25:35.481
Is it axid-proof?

25:38.954 --> 25:40.035
I can't do it, guys.

25:43.208 --> 25:44.289
These people need our help.

25:44.376 --> 25:47.460
Yeah. Sorry, but me getting melted,
that is a deal-breaker.

25:47.546 --> 25:48.536
Were you only doing this

25:48.630 --> 25:49.746
because you thought
you couldn't get hurt?

25:50.090 --> 25:52.298
Yeah. Why the hell else
would I do this?

25:52.551 --> 25:55.385
Ralph, last year, I thought
I was gonna die too.

25:55.763 --> 25:57.095
But that didn't stop me.

25:57.723 --> 26:00.136
Okay. Well, that's
the difference between us, then.

26:01.226 --> 26:03.468
I'm not that strong
in the face of danger.

26:04.646 --> 26:05.636
I'm out.

26:25.959 --> 26:27.325
<i>Psst, Barry.</i>

26:31.799 --> 26:32.915
Ralph, what are you doing here?

26:33.133 --> 26:34.544
I'm breaking you out.

26:42.059 --> 26:43.971
I mean, come on. You're a hero.

26:44.520 --> 26:46.182
Slap on some tights, go be heroic.

26:46.271 --> 26:48.854
Ralph, there are
cameras everywhere. Okay?

26:48.941 --> 26:51.354
They would know within minutes
that I'd vanished.

26:51.443 --> 26:54.060
So? A minute to us
is like hours to you.

26:54.154 --> 26:56.737
Just vibrate through the walls,
go slap Trickster around

26:56.824 --> 26:58.156
and you'll be back before

26:58.242 --> 26:59.824
whatever passes
for dinner in this place.

26:59.910 --> 27:01.446
- Trickster attacked again?
- Yeah.

27:01.537 --> 27:02.994
He and his mommy want
to tussle with me,

27:03.080 --> 27:04.787
but I have a rule
against fighting terrorists

27:04.873 --> 27:05.989
with an Oedipus complex.

27:06.083 --> 27:09.747
So, this looks like a job
for the F-L-A-S-H.

27:09.837 --> 27:11.703
Sorry, why is this different?

27:12.214 --> 27:14.706
You've done a good job
handling bad guys so far.

27:22.099 --> 27:23.215
I got hurt.

27:24.351 --> 27:27.059
Axel created some kind of acid that,

27:27.146 --> 27:28.136
we're guessing,

27:29.314 --> 27:30.680
can probably kill me.

27:32.025 --> 27:33.391
I'm not ready to die.

27:37.281 --> 27:39.614
Look, this job,

27:41.076 --> 27:43.284
it has a way
of making you feel invincible.

27:44.621 --> 27:48.035
But, every once in a while,
a little mortality check shows up.

27:50.502 --> 27:54.542
I've been trying so hard
to ignore this feeling, but...

27:56.341 --> 27:58.378
I'm not fearless like you are.

27:59.219 --> 28:00.926
Ralph, I'm not fearless.

28:01.305 --> 28:03.217
I mean, I wake up every day
in this cell

28:03.307 --> 28:05.469
and feel like there's nothing
I can do to help anyone.

28:05.559 --> 28:07.642
And, I mean, that terrifies me.

28:07.936 --> 28:11.304
I used to be somebody who saved
and now I'm just Barry Allen,

28:11.398 --> 28:13.230
inmate number 3562.

28:14.234 --> 28:16.100
- So let me spring you.
- That's not my point.

28:16.987 --> 28:20.947
Having the ability to help someone
but do nothing,

28:21.575 --> 28:22.941
that is a far worse death

28:23.035 --> 28:25.072
than anything
that Trickster has for you.

28:26.413 --> 28:29.451
But rising above that fear
and saving those lives,

28:29.541 --> 28:31.203
that's a greater life.

28:31.919 --> 28:33.285
All right? So rise up.

28:34.254 --> 28:36.086
I don't think it's a stretch for you.

28:39.343 --> 28:41.505
- You really believe I can do that?
- Yes.

28:42.262 --> 28:43.924
You just need to believe it yourself.

28:52.397 --> 28:54.263
Hey, you know your way
out of here, right?

28:54.358 --> 28:55.348
Yeah.

28:55.442 --> 28:56.432
You got one hour.

29:08.830 --> 29:11.493
Scans are reading some kind of
container on the roof. It looks new.

29:12.793 --> 29:14.876
Galvanized steel. That's where
they're keeping the axid.

29:14.962 --> 29:17.875
All right, I will neutralize it,
and you two guys,

29:18.799 --> 29:20.006
you get the hostages out.
Oh...

29:20.717 --> 29:22.003
We're gonna need the ice queen.

29:22.219 --> 29:23.801
That's not how it works.
I can't just...

29:23.887 --> 29:25.298
- Lexi LaRoche!
- Lexi LaRoche!

29:26.390 --> 29:27.380
It's her childhood bully.

29:28.433 --> 29:29.890
There's a lot of repressed anger
in there.

29:30.060 --> 29:31.050
Let's go!

29:35.274 --> 29:36.264
Oh, boy.

29:37.192 --> 29:38.182
Here we go.

29:39.278 --> 29:40.985
Thank you. Big Sir.

29:42.781 --> 29:44.898
My dad saved your life in here,
didn't he?

29:44.992 --> 29:46.358
That's why you helped me out.

29:47.035 --> 29:48.025
How?

29:55.419 --> 29:56.785
I had stomach pains for days.

29:58.171 --> 29:59.628
<i>Your dad found me,</i>

30:00.048 --> 30:02.131
figured my appendix
was about to burst.

30:02.551 --> 30:03.962
Prison doctors are gone
for the night.

30:04.052 --> 30:06.260
There's no way
they could've made it back in time.

30:07.180 --> 30:10.924
But Doc Henry convinced Warden Wolfe
to do the surgery.

30:13.770 --> 30:15.511
He operated and saved my life.

30:15.856 --> 30:17.267
That's why you owed him.

30:17.733 --> 30:19.099
Now we're even.

30:34.750 --> 30:35.740
Big Sir.

30:47.054 --> 30:48.215
Okay.

30:48.305 --> 30:52.675
Remember, anything in here
that looks fun is probably lethal.

30:52.851 --> 30:55.685
- Just like me.
- Nice. Okay.

30:55.771 --> 30:57.979
<i>Let's deliver these delivery people
to safety.</i>

30:58.899 --> 31:02.233
Or we could just leave them
and kill Trickster and Prank.

31:02.527 --> 31:03.768
Remember that talk

31:03.862 --> 31:05.478
about murdering your way
out of problems?

31:05.572 --> 31:07.564
- Yeah, we don't do that.
- Yet.

31:09.868 --> 31:11.109
I'm gonna get you out of here.

31:12.204 --> 31:14.161
<i>Beebo hungry.</i>

31:16.792 --> 31:18.954
<i>Beebo likes to play.</i>

31:19.044 --> 31:20.330
<i>Beebo.</i>

31:31.348 --> 31:32.714
Tricked ya.

31:33.141 --> 31:34.803
I'm guessing the plan didn't work.

31:35.852 --> 31:36.842
Help!

31:37.979 --> 31:40.687
Harry, it's a trap.
They've got Caitlin and Cisco.

31:41.066 --> 31:42.557
- I'm on my way.
- No, you're not.

31:43.777 --> 31:44.767
I am.

31:46.947 --> 31:48.313
Then you're gonna need this.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.495
Groovy.

32:12.097 --> 32:13.338
Hey!

32:16.476 --> 32:17.637
Leave him alone.

32:24.276 --> 32:25.733
I told you you'd be sorry.

32:47.048 --> 32:48.380
You won't get lucky twice.

33:02.814 --> 33:04.601
Like father, like son, eh?

33:10.697 --> 33:11.687
<i>Harry,
are you on the roof yet?</i>

33:12.449 --> 33:13.940
Yes. And so is the axid.

33:14.367 --> 33:15.357
All right.

33:19.164 --> 33:21.156
You need to neutralize the axid.
We're running out of time.

33:21.249 --> 33:22.581
<i>Yeah. Thank you. I'm aware of that.</i>

33:27.589 --> 33:28.625
Oh-oh!

33:28.715 --> 33:31.128
<i>Well, we asked for one hero.</i>

33:31.468 --> 33:34.336
But now, we've got two.

33:35.305 --> 33:37.046
<i>It's time
for our showcase showdown.</i>

33:37.140 --> 33:38.130
<i>So let's spin that wheel</i>

33:38.225 --> 33:40.763
<i>and see what fun prize
awaits our new friends.</i>

33:43.939 --> 33:44.929
Harry?

33:45.190 --> 33:46.522
<i>Tell me you got it.</i>

33:48.360 --> 33:49.350
Don't got it.

33:51.029 --> 33:52.236
Hurry up.

33:52.322 --> 33:53.938
I haven't killed anyone in years.

33:56.701 --> 33:58.067
<i>A tie?</i>

33:58.161 --> 34:00.494
Hmm, I guess they die together.

34:19.516 --> 34:20.848
Nice outfit.

34:22.351 --> 34:23.717
Thanks. I've got a great tailor.

34:24.312 --> 34:26.895
Now let everyone go, pranksters,
and no one gets hurt.

34:27.190 --> 34:28.976
We thought you chickened out,
Stretchy Man.

34:29.525 --> 34:30.983
Actually, I did.

34:31.069 --> 34:32.856
See, I thought
I was pretty much invincible

34:32.946 --> 34:34.562
until you
and your oversized water pistol

34:34.656 --> 34:36.989
- put the fear of God in me.
- You're welcome.

34:37.367 --> 34:39.233
And I was ready
to throw in the towel.

34:39.327 --> 34:40.784
But then I visited a friend of mine.

34:41.246 --> 34:44.114
And he helped me remember
that no one is fearless.

34:44.331 --> 34:45.539
But real heroes,

34:45.792 --> 34:47.829
they find a way
to rise above that fear

34:47.918 --> 34:49.159
and make a difference anyway,

34:49.754 --> 34:51.710
<i>even if it kills them in the process.</i>

34:52.299 --> 34:53.585
<i>So, this is me,</i>

34:54.342 --> 34:55.378
rising up,

34:55.885 --> 34:57.842
hopefully without the dying part.

34:59.139 --> 35:02.007
Now, let my friends go.

35:05.228 --> 35:07.515
First of all, great speech.

35:07.689 --> 35:10.682
So inspired. It melted my heart.

35:10.775 --> 35:12.641
Thank you.
I worked on it on the way over.

35:12.986 --> 35:14.102
Now let's melt yours.

35:15.572 --> 35:16.562
<i>Shoot him.</i>

35:30.462 --> 35:31.873
Oh! Boo-Boo!

35:33.006 --> 35:34.213
I'd give up if I were you.

35:36.593 --> 35:38.550
How about I melt
your friends instead?

35:40.639 --> 35:41.629
<i>Harry, now.</i>

35:41.723 --> 35:42.713
I don't got it.

35:42.807 --> 35:43.797
<i>Harry?</i>

35:47.646 --> 35:48.636
No!

35:52.067 --> 35:53.774
Say goodbye to your little friends.

35:55.654 --> 35:56.644
<i>Harry!</i>

36:07.082 --> 36:08.072
It doesn't hurt.

36:09.834 --> 36:11.200
It doesn't hurt!

36:12.545 --> 36:13.911
I'm not dying.

36:15.298 --> 36:16.789
Why am I not dying?

36:18.134 --> 36:19.716
Because I got it.

36:20.679 --> 36:22.341
Yes! Nice work, guys.

36:25.392 --> 36:27.258
I'm gonna live! Whoo!

36:28.853 --> 36:30.139
Don't even think about running.

36:32.774 --> 36:33.764
- Anytime.
- Oh, yeah.

36:34.526 --> 36:36.233
You got scissors anywhere?

36:40.281 --> 36:41.772
You know what they say, Detective?

36:42.367 --> 36:44.734
The family that slays together,
stays together.

36:44.828 --> 36:46.069
- Yeah. In prison.
- Hey, come on.

36:46.162 --> 36:47.903
You can't keep a Trickster
behind bars for long.

36:47.997 --> 36:48.987
We'll see about that.

36:49.082 --> 36:50.243
You were amazing.

36:50.333 --> 36:51.995
Can we do it again in 10 to 15 years?

36:52.085 --> 36:54.828
Boo-Boo, I'm gonna break us
out of here in two.

36:54.921 --> 36:57.083
Get in the damn car.

37:02.637 --> 37:06.301
Is it true that you took down
Trickster and Prank single-handedly?

37:06.391 --> 37:08.007
<i>How long
have you been a superhero?</i>

37:08.101 --> 37:09.433
<i>Are you single?</i>

37:09.519 --> 37:12.102
Yes. About an hour. Oh, hell, yes.

37:12.480 --> 37:13.596
Do you like shrimp?

37:13.898 --> 37:17.767
No. But I'm sure the people
of Central City would love

37:17.861 --> 37:19.397
to thank you, Stretchy Man.

37:19.988 --> 37:21.354
That's not my name.

37:21.448 --> 37:24.111
Then what should we call you?
I mean, you do stretch.

37:24.284 --> 37:26.992
No, I don't stretch. I...

37:27.078 --> 37:28.489
I contort.

37:28.580 --> 37:30.788
I elasticize. I...

37:31.040 --> 37:32.997
I elongate, man.

37:36.671 --> 37:37.752
<i>"The Elongated Man"?</i>

37:38.673 --> 37:39.834
<i>It was just an expression.</i>

37:40.467 --> 37:42.424
It has a certain, <i>je ne sais quoi</i> to it.

37:42.510 --> 37:43.967
I don't know.

37:44.179 --> 37:46.045
- I like it, too.
- Well, I hate it.

37:47.265 --> 37:48.631
Oh, maybe you should've let me
do the naming.

37:48.725 --> 37:49.715
Exactly.

37:49.809 --> 37:52.847
Don't worry. You'll get your chance.
There's no way this is gonna stick.

37:53.229 --> 37:55.016
Probably gonna stick.

37:55.106 --> 37:56.597
The Elongated Man?

37:56.691 --> 37:58.933
Please. It's so literal.

37:59.027 --> 38:01.189
You think Prince would have settled
for "Shorty Guitar Man"?

38:01.279 --> 38:03.737
- Hey.
- No way. And like the Purple One,

38:03.823 --> 38:07.692
I too need something that hints
at the true depth of my sexy nature.

38:07.786 --> 38:09.698
- Like "The Flash"?
- Exactly.

38:09.788 --> 38:12.496
He's a fast operator.
Gets the job done in seconds.

38:12.582 --> 38:13.789
Or "Killer Frost."

38:13.875 --> 38:15.832
What can I say?
When you got it, you got it.

38:16.211 --> 38:17.201
You got it.

38:19.422 --> 38:20.412
Hey, Joe.

38:20.590 --> 38:21.626
Hmm?

38:21.883 --> 38:22.873
What should I do?

38:25.053 --> 38:28.512
Man, do whatever it takes
to keep this city safe.

38:30.099 --> 38:31.635
Just like the rest of us.

38:34.729 --> 38:36.345
I can live with that.

38:37.690 --> 38:40.057
Guess I'll be looking out for you
a bit longer.

38:40.568 --> 38:42.525
I didn't get involved
because I wanted a favor.

38:42.612 --> 38:43.648
I just wanted to help.

38:46.825 --> 38:50.193
Piece of advice. You want
to survive in here, find a friend.

38:51.621 --> 38:53.783
Your father would be
very proud of you.

38:54.874 --> 38:55.864
Thanks.

38:57.043 --> 38:58.705
Did my dad call you Big Sir?

38:59.295 --> 39:00.331
No.

39:00.421 --> 39:01.582
He called me Dave.

39:02.382 --> 39:03.964
Allen, you've got a visitor.

39:06.970 --> 39:09.257
Well, whatever you said
to Ralph must've landed.

39:09.347 --> 39:11.930
He risked his life to save Caitlin
and Cisco, thanks to you.

39:12.350 --> 39:14.216
I just brought out
what was already inside him.

39:14.394 --> 39:16.977
You seem to have that effect
on a lot of people.

39:19.691 --> 39:20.727
What?

39:21.818 --> 39:24.185
Just turns out being in here
isn't so different

39:24.279 --> 39:25.395
from being out there.

39:27.532 --> 39:28.864
Except we're not together.

39:31.452 --> 39:33.239
And I can't touch you anymore.

40:11.743 --> 40:14.235
Coffee? That's all I get
for being a hero?

40:14.329 --> 40:16.321
What do you want, a cookie?

40:16.706 --> 40:17.696
Don't mind if I do.

40:18.958 --> 40:20.574
Come on, man.

40:22.962 --> 40:25.750
The thing about wearing a mask is
no one even knows you're a good guy.

40:26.382 --> 40:27.918
Them's the breaks, kid.

40:28.593 --> 40:31.631
Aha! Yes. There's the delicious nectar.

40:31.721 --> 40:33.587
Hey, thanks for getting this coffee,
by the way.

40:34.057 --> 40:35.844
Who, me? I'm broke.

40:36.225 --> 40:38.217
I didn't even bring my wallet
with me.

40:38.686 --> 40:40.222
I don't even own a wallet.

40:40.313 --> 40:42.020
- Are you serious?
- Allen always pays.

40:42.106 --> 40:43.096
Oh, my God.

40:43.983 --> 40:45.315
No worries.

40:46.819 --> 40:49.357
The... Always pay it forward.

40:49.447 --> 40:51.279
That's my motto, you know?

40:51.783 --> 40:54.821
'Cause at any given moment, one of us
could need a helping hand.

40:54.911 --> 40:58.700
Like now. You two total strangers,
you know, were short on cash

40:58.790 --> 41:00.497
and then someone
just steps out of the blue

41:00.583 --> 41:01.949
and helps out
in a totally random way. Am I right?

41:02.794 --> 41:04.001
Uh-huh.

41:04.295 --> 41:07.129
And, you know,
it's more than just karma.

41:07.215 --> 41:09.457
It's the principle
of infinite consequence at work

41:09.550 --> 41:11.041
in our lives.

41:11.135 --> 41:13.092
And it's always expanding.

41:14.097 --> 41:17.215
Creating positive sums
on an infinite basis.

41:17.308 --> 41:18.640
Isn't that amazing?

41:20.770 --> 41:21.760
Yes?

41:22.146 --> 41:23.307
You know what's amazing?

41:23.773 --> 41:25.355
- That shirt's pretty amazing.
- Yeah.

41:25.858 --> 41:28.817
Thanks. Yeah. It's a classic.
<i>Oregon Trail.</i> I love this game.

41:29.028 --> 41:30.314
Have a great day.

41:31.781 --> 41:32.771
Okay.

41:34.659 --> 41:36.901
A nice, beautiful girl
and Ralph Dibny doesn't offer her

41:36.995 --> 41:38.361
a delicious crustacean buffet?

41:38.871 --> 41:40.157
Mmm, I think she's too smart for me.

41:40.957 --> 41:44.041
Self-awareness from Ralph Dibny?
I think there's hope for you yet.

41:44.210 --> 41:45.291
That's a stretch.

41:45.378 --> 41:46.835
Is that
where we freeze-frame?
