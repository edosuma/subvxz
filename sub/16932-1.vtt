02:07.461 --> 02:09.363
Coming through
angels 19!

02:09.363 --> 02:12.700
Take it easy, viper one.
Don't push it too far.

02:12.700 --> 02:13.701
Throttling back.

02:13.701 --> 02:15.536
18-5.

02:15.536 --> 02:16.670
Rpm 2,500.

02:18.572 --> 02:21.342
Airspeed--airspeed
needle stuck...

02:21.342 --> 02:23.544
But we're still
in the green.

02:23.544 --> 02:24.845
17-5.

02:24.845 --> 02:27.114
Aw, heck.

02:27.114 --> 02:28.682
15-5.

02:28.682 --> 02:30.818
Vsi pegged.

02:30.818 --> 02:31.819
Negative buffet.

02:34.488 --> 02:38.091
Sir, sir, I know what
you're going to say,

02:38.091 --> 02:41.229
but remember what happened
with the b-39.

02:41.229 --> 02:42.963
danny here?

02:42.963 --> 02:44.232
[Danny]
It's sticking!

02:44.232 --> 02:46.200
We're pretty much
in a dive up here.

02:46.200 --> 02:48.402
It's 12-5...

02:48.402 --> 02:50.003
And she's purring,
all right.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.605
Bring it back,
viper one.

02:51.605 --> 02:52.940
roger! Oh!

02:53.974 --> 02:55.609
Serious fluttering!

02:55.609 --> 02:56.410
It's hard.

02:56.410 --> 02:58.246
Controls are resisting.

02:58.246 --> 03:00.113
I have full nose-up trim.

03:00.113 --> 03:01.715
Slip it in, viper one.

03:01.715 --> 03:02.516
Come on, slip it in!

03:02.516 --> 03:03.717
[Danny]
This isn't good!

03:03.717 --> 03:05.152
Aah!

03:05.152 --> 03:06.654
Aah!

03:07.821 --> 03:10.090
It's...Too much!

03:10.090 --> 03:11.392
[Grunting]

03:11.392 --> 03:12.993
christ.
Pull her back!

03:12.993 --> 03:15.195
[Siren]

03:16.997 --> 03:18.266
Oh, brother.

03:22.870 --> 03:23.871
Oh, brother!

03:41.154 --> 03:42.490
Look out!

03:49.830 --> 03:50.831
Whew!

03:52.800 --> 03:55.836
If she comes
with a warranty,
i'll take her!

03:55.836 --> 03:57.505
[Laughter and applause]

03:57.505 --> 03:59.307
She doesn't seem
to need that.

03:59.307 --> 04:02.510
dave, hope you're not
married to these
pratt and whitneys.

04:02.510 --> 04:04.111
This plane needs
classic engines.

04:04.111 --> 04:05.513
Have it ready by tonight.

04:05.513 --> 04:07.114
harry!
Did you see that?

04:07.114 --> 04:08.316
What, danny?
See what?

04:08.316 --> 04:09.517
Captain!

04:09.517 --> 04:10.484
Oh.

04:11.385 --> 04:12.953
Mccormick--three cs.
You figure it out.

04:12.953 --> 04:15.155
harry, the damnedest
thing happened up there.

04:15.155 --> 04:16.156
Any
dizziness?

04:16.156 --> 04:17.458
Huh? What? No.

04:17.458 --> 04:19.459
Excuse me, i'm still
having a heart attack.

04:19.459 --> 04:21.060
It looked good,
didn't it?

04:21.060 --> 04:22.062
Queasiness?

04:22.062 --> 04:23.196
No queasiness.

04:23.196 --> 04:24.565
I thought
you weren't
surfacing

04:24.565 --> 04:26.166
until you
finished
your thing.

04:26.166 --> 04:27.167
Blackout?

04:27.167 --> 04:28.168
No blackouts.

04:28.168 --> 04:29.570
Don't work
for the airline.

04:29.570 --> 04:31.572
I bet you thought
i wouldn't pull up.

04:31.572 --> 04:33.173
The thought
crossed my mind.

04:33.173 --> 04:34.308
Mine, too.

04:34.308 --> 04:35.543
Blindness?
Headache?
Chest pain?

04:35.543 --> 04:36.677
No.

04:36.677 --> 04:38.746
I was close enough
to see your
license plate,

04:38.746 --> 04:41.214
and all of a sudden
i saw helen.

04:41.214 --> 04:42.383
You had a vision?

04:42.383 --> 04:43.384
Huh? Agh!

04:43.384 --> 04:44.785
Did you vomit?

04:44.785 --> 04:46.787
tyler, no. There
was no vomit.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.389
i'm talking now.
Later, huh?

04:48.389 --> 04:49.790
Anything you say,
captain.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.124
Nice soft landing.

04:51.124 --> 04:54.061
I thought, "she's
coming home tonight.
I better pull up."

04:54.061 --> 04:55.463
Wham!
I hit the ground.

04:55.463 --> 04:56.630
Boy, am I hungry.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.632
I could go for
some ribs.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.834
danny, i'm here
because it worked.

05:00.834 --> 05:02.002
It worked?

05:02.002 --> 05:04.705
A little rough
around the edges,
but it worked.

05:04.705 --> 05:05.973
What?

05:05.973 --> 05:07.307
harry.

05:10.644 --> 05:12.112
That's incredible,
harry!

05:12.112 --> 05:13.280
Shh! Listen, listen!

05:13.280 --> 05:14.682
No one can know, o.K.?

05:14.682 --> 05:16.684
Of course.
No one can know.

05:16.684 --> 05:18.285
Uh, helen can know,
right?

05:18.285 --> 05:19.687
All right,
but nobody else.

05:19.687 --> 05:21.655
It really is
sort of incredible.

05:21.655 --> 05:22.856
harry.
That's incredible.

05:22.856 --> 05:24.024
Where is he?

05:24.024 --> 05:25.258
Back at the lab.

05:25.258 --> 05:26.259
harry! Oh!

05:26.259 --> 05:27.428
i'll get
cleaned up.

05:27.428 --> 05:28.429
We'll celebrate!

05:28.429 --> 05:30.431
Oh, my god.
Ha ha! harry!

05:30.431 --> 05:32.332
Hey, i'm driving!

05:32.332 --> 05:34.502
Ha ha ha.
Sure, o.K.

05:34.502 --> 05:37.471
Yeah...
Better be o.K.

05:51.218 --> 05:56.156
[billie holiday]

05:56.156 --> 06:00.561

ordinary things *

ought to do *

though it may seem *

06:24.718 --> 06:29.189
* to me that's everything *

* your eyes
in the stars above... **

06:55.082 --> 06:56.550
who is that?

06:58.619 --> 07:01.088
i'm sorry
i'm so late.

07:01.088 --> 07:02.490
What time is it?

07:02.490 --> 07:03.891
Almost 2:00.

07:03.891 --> 07:06.293
I was going to go
to my place,

07:06.293 --> 07:08.295
but I decided
i wanted to see you.

07:08.295 --> 07:09.897
I hope
you don't mind.

07:09.897 --> 07:11.298
I kind of do.

07:11.298 --> 07:13.467
Would you leave, please?

07:28.649 --> 07:30.518
You taste like
champagne.

07:30.518 --> 07:32.520
Well, harry and i
got a little drunk.

07:32.520 --> 07:33.521
Oh, yeah?

07:33.521 --> 07:34.522
Yeah.

07:34.522 --> 07:35.523
A celebration?

07:35.523 --> 07:37.190
Well, kind of.

07:44.264 --> 07:46.399
You're hungry.

07:46.399 --> 07:47.467
I know.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.402
So...

07:49.402 --> 07:52.072
What were you
celebrating?

07:52.072 --> 07:53.473
Wait, let me guess.

07:53.473 --> 07:54.875
harry's 400th
consecutive hour

07:54.875 --> 07:56.476
in the laboratory,
right?

07:56.476 --> 07:58.812
Close,
but no cigar.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.549
How is it?

08:01.549 --> 08:04.752
danny, i've been
eating dust
for four days.

08:06.554 --> 08:08.155
So...

08:09.422 --> 08:10.824
What were you
celebrating?

08:10.824 --> 08:12.826
The key question
here is,

08:12.826 --> 08:14.427
why wasn't I invited?

08:14.427 --> 08:17.430
Well, we would've
if you were here.

08:17.430 --> 08:19.700
harry froze
a chicken.

08:19.700 --> 08:22.202
Big deal.
My butcher's done that.

08:22.202 --> 08:23.436
Yeah? Well...

08:23.436 --> 08:25.438
i'll bet
your butcher's
never brought

08:25.438 --> 08:28.308
the chicken back
to life again.

08:28.308 --> 08:30.043
He what?

08:30.043 --> 08:31.044
I swear!

08:31.044 --> 08:33.313
I saw the chicken.
It was walking around!

08:33.313 --> 08:34.582
harry's a genius,

08:34.582 --> 08:35.982
which he was
proclaiming himself

08:35.982 --> 08:37.851
after the second
bottle of champagne.

08:37.851 --> 08:41.955
So, what, this is
some big government
chicken conspiracy?

08:41.955 --> 08:42.756
What?

08:42.756 --> 08:43.991
Don't take this
lightly.

08:43.991 --> 08:46.560
You can't
tell anybody,
all right?

08:46.560 --> 08:47.595
Just my mother.

08:47.595 --> 08:49.597
Oh, helen, no.
Y-you can't.

08:49.597 --> 08:50.864
[Laughing]

08:50.864 --> 08:52.465
i'm sorry.
I was kidding.

08:52.465 --> 08:53.967
Promise me
you won't tell.

08:53.967 --> 08:54.968
I promise.

08:54.968 --> 08:55.769
I promise.

08:55.769 --> 08:57.204
Not even under torture.

08:57.204 --> 08:58.572
Not even
under torture.

08:58.572 --> 09:02.209
Not even under the
most incredibly painful
kind of torture.

09:02.209 --> 09:03.877
danny, don't.

09:03.877 --> 09:06.479
helen, this is a matter
of national security.

09:06.479 --> 09:08.616
i'm going to have
to tickle you.

09:08.616 --> 09:10.050
No. i'm not kidding.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.018
I need to know.

09:11.018 --> 09:13.754
No. i'll scream.
i'll really scream!

09:13.754 --> 09:15.355
It's for
your own good.

09:15.355 --> 09:17.190
danny, no! No!

09:17.190 --> 09:18.491
Oh, not the knees!

09:18.491 --> 09:20.828
Oh, stop!

then he's out.

10:07.975 --> 10:09.977
Yeah, but why
is he running?

11:38.598 --> 11:41.468
Look, it's 1939 already,

11:41.468 --> 11:43.804
and we...

11:43.804 --> 11:46.206
Gosh, you usually
get my thoughts
before I do,

11:46.206 --> 11:49.609
so you probably
know what i'm
going to say.

11:49.609 --> 11:50.944

11:53.346 --> 11:55.315
Will you marry me?

Uh...No.

12:01.889 --> 12:04.357
You know, helen,
i been thinking--

12:04.357 --> 12:05.592
danny, guess what.

12:05.592 --> 12:07.160
What?

12:07.160 --> 12:08.896
collier's wants
the pictures
for november.

12:08.896 --> 12:10.163
No kidding?
Oh, that's great.

12:10.163 --> 12:13.166
But they say
it's kind of
a rush thing.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.168
They need
the pictures
bu thursday,

12:15.168 --> 12:18.171
which means I have
to have them ready
tomorrow afternoon,

12:18.171 --> 12:20.373
which means I have
to get to work.

12:20.373 --> 12:21.574
I have to go.

12:21.574 --> 12:22.575
Wait.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.377
What?

12:24.377 --> 12:25.913
Want some pie?

12:25.913 --> 12:27.815
We just had pie.

12:27.815 --> 12:28.982
Not the blueberry.

12:28.982 --> 12:31.051
How could you
still be hungry?

12:31.051 --> 12:32.652
Isn't that
the darnedest thing?

12:32.652 --> 12:35.555
I just--frank?
Some blueberry pie.

12:35.555 --> 12:37.157
Sure you don't
want some?

You're going to test
some crazy rocket?

13:06.119 --> 13:08.121

this stuff up?

Hi, harry.

18:08.121 --> 18:10.123
After the first
two weeks,

18:10.123 --> 18:11.991
they said she
wouldn't wake up.

18:11.991 --> 18:13.993
That was nearly
six months ago.

18:13.993 --> 18:15.262
Doctors
can be wrong.

18:15.262 --> 18:17.730

to dr. morrison...

the same thing.

18:22.135 --> 18:24.537

see you later."

18:24.537 --> 18:26.739
That was
the last thing
she said--

18:26.739 --> 18:28.308
"i'll see you
later."

18:28.308 --> 18:33.246

18:35.114 --> 18:37.450
It's a better place,
i think.

18:38.785 --> 18:42.655
The doctors all agree
there's nothing
that can be done.

18:42.655 --> 18:46.859
We used to play out
by the lighthouse
when we were kids...

18:49.128 --> 18:53.132

grow old together...

just down the road.

one single memory
without her.

until she knew.

19:14.287 --> 19:16.623
charlie was canned
from my project?

19:16.623 --> 19:17.724
No.

19:17.724 --> 19:20.427
They found two
bottles of gin
in his locker.

19:20.427 --> 19:22.028
He tried to deny it,

19:22.028 --> 19:23.430
but he was
so sozzled,

19:23.430 --> 19:25.432
he fell on his ass
and passed out.

before the test,

28:40.719 --> 28:43.322
It's cold.

28:43.322 --> 28:44.723
Yeesh.

29:06.312 --> 29:08.347
Aah!

29:17.756 --> 29:19.358
Look at him.

29:21.660 --> 29:23.062
He's cold, too.

29:23.062 --> 29:25.264
Do you think he's dead?

29:25.264 --> 29:26.765
Aah!
Aah!

29:26.765 --> 29:27.666
Help me!

29:27.666 --> 29:30.169
Get me out of this thing!

29:30.169 --> 29:31.170
Help!

29:31.170 --> 29:32.171
Help!

29:32.171 --> 29:34.273
Aah! Aah!

29:50.222 --> 29:51.824
steven,
we went inside there!

29:51.824 --> 29:53.225
There was this
big metal thing!

29:53.225 --> 29:55.427
There's a dead
guy inside!

29:55.427 --> 29:56.829
Just shut up!

29:56.829 --> 29:58.297
steven, I swear!

29:58.297 --> 30:01.233
He was really cold.
He grabbed my jacket
and took it!

30:01.233 --> 30:04.436
If I was cold,
i'd take your
jacket also.

30:04.436 --> 30:05.838
No, but he didn't--

30:05.838 --> 30:07.840
shut up! You're
pathetic, both of you!

30:07.840 --> 30:10.442
Look, I am the boss
in this car!

30:10.442 --> 30:11.844
Me! I am!

30:11.844 --> 30:13.445
And the boss says...

30:13.445 --> 30:15.147
Shut up!

30:15.147 --> 30:17.249
Are you sure this isn't
the finest excuse

30:17.249 --> 30:20.853
you've ever come up with
for losing a jacket?

30:20.853 --> 30:22.254
It'd be
a great excuse,

30:22.254 --> 30:24.256
but no, mom,
it's the truth.

30:24.256 --> 30:26.258
This frozen guy
was there!

30:26.258 --> 30:29.461
I was there,
and I saw him, too!

30:31.263 --> 30:34.466
i'm sure he's in there
for a reason.

30:34.466 --> 30:36.068
Finish your peas.

30:48.580 --> 30:50.616
[Grunting]

30:56.855 --> 30:58.257
[Grunting]

31:54.746 --> 31:57.549
I...

31:57.549 --> 31:58.951
Would like...

Excuse me?

32:13.532 --> 32:14.967

32:14.967 --> 32:15.968
Yes!

32:15.968 --> 32:17.970
Please. i'd like...

32:17.970 --> 32:20.872
To speak to...

32:20.872 --> 32:22.975
harry f-finley.

32:22.975 --> 32:26.378
harry--
harry finley,
please.

32:26.378 --> 32:27.980
Sir, you're missing
two digits.

32:27.980 --> 32:29.982
You need seven digits,
sir.

32:29.982 --> 32:31.984
You only gave me five.
You need seven.

32:31.984 --> 32:32.985
Wha--

32:32.985 --> 32:35.187
[dial tone]

32:36.989 --> 32:39.191
[Helicopter approaches]

33:00.012 --> 33:01.713
Oh, brother.

33:02.881 --> 33:05.217
[Counting cadence]

33:21.533 --> 33:22.634
Sir, i'm sorry.

33:22.634 --> 33:24.970
There's no one
stationed here
by that name.

33:24.970 --> 33:26.838
Aw, heck.

33:26.838 --> 33:30.576
Well, then I need to talk
to someone else in charge.

33:30.576 --> 33:34.980
i'm sorry, but
there's no way I can
let you in here.

33:34.980 --> 33:37.849
I know how I must
look to you, o.K.?

33:37.849 --> 33:42.054
And believe me, I wouldn't
let me in here, either.

33:42.054 --> 33:43.522
Sir?

33:43.522 --> 33:48.060
i'm sorry, but
i'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

33:48.060 --> 33:51.463
My name is captain
daniel mccormick.

33:51.463 --> 33:56.668
Serial number
241988539.

33:56.668 --> 33:58.470
I know your name, too.

33:58.470 --> 34:01.473
Now, you sure look
like a nice kid.

34:01.473 --> 34:05.477
But if you don't get
your supervisor
out here now,

34:05.477 --> 34:07.479
I will personally
make sure

34:07.479 --> 34:12.083
that you pull guard duty
for the rest of
your military career!

34:12.083 --> 34:14.420
Have you got that?

34:22.328 --> 34:25.496
And you say it
was registered
as project b,

34:25.496 --> 34:27.132
which stands
for buford?

34:27.132 --> 34:28.134
Yes, sir.

34:28.134 --> 34:30.702
That was the name
of the...

34:30.702 --> 34:31.570
Chicken.

34:31.570 --> 34:33.705
That harry finley
first tested?

34:33.705 --> 34:35.107
That's correct.

34:35.107 --> 34:37.443
And you say you
woke up last night

34:37.443 --> 34:39.511
in the warehouse
that we're
tearing down.

34:39.511 --> 34:42.148
I know that
it sounds crazy,
but, uh--

34:42.148 --> 34:43.482
just a little.

34:45.083 --> 34:48.786
Who was your
supervising officer?

34:48.786 --> 34:49.788
Boyle.

34:49.788 --> 34:51.989
Major david e. Boyle.

34:51.989 --> 34:54.126
Boyle.

34:54.126 --> 34:57.129
I went to the place
where harry used to live.

34:57.129 --> 35:00.732
Now there's a place
called ralph's there.

35:00.732 --> 35:01.967
I see.

35:01.967 --> 35:05.537
Well, we don't
keep records that
far back on base.

35:05.537 --> 35:07.939
But there is a team
of scientists

35:07.939 --> 35:12.144
that would be
fascinated to hear
what you have to say.

35:12.144 --> 35:13.745
This is all highly
classified information?

35:13.745 --> 35:14.713
That's right.

35:14.713 --> 35:16.548
harry didn't tell
anybody about this.

35:16.548 --> 35:18.950
Not even the people
that worked for him knew.

35:18.950 --> 35:22.754
Just harry and I,
and I told one
other person, but...

35:22.754 --> 35:23.755
Who's that?

35:23.755 --> 35:24.756
She's dead.

35:24.756 --> 35:27.025
Uh-huh.

35:27.025 --> 35:29.161
i'm going to
call security.

35:29.161 --> 35:30.396
That'd be swell.

35:30.396 --> 35:32.598
Can I have a cigarette?

35:32.598 --> 35:34.166
Oh, yeah. Sure.

35:37.703 --> 35:40.339
sam? Yeah. Me.

35:40.339 --> 35:41.740
i've got
something here

35:41.740 --> 35:44.276
I think you should
do something about.

35:44.276 --> 35:48.247
Yeah. Yeah, so I think
you should probably meet.

35:48.247 --> 35:50.148
He says he was
in a metal capsule

35:50.148 --> 35:52.284
in our warehouse
for a number of years.

35:52.284 --> 35:55.120
You might want to come
over with some men.

35:55.120 --> 35:56.988
Because I think,
you know,

35:56.988 --> 35:59.491
it's really
going to be a...

35:59.491 --> 36:01.993
It's going to be a...

36:01.993 --> 36:04.596
sam, hold on
one sec, sam.

36:12.003 --> 36:14.240
You can cancel it, sam.

36:15.040 --> 36:16.408
i'm not lying.

36:17.243 --> 36:18.510
You're lying.

36:18.510 --> 36:20.412
He said
he'd never seen
so many cavities

36:20.412 --> 36:22.414
in one mouth
at the same time.

36:22.414 --> 36:25.016
He wanted to send a
sample of my saliva

36:25.016 --> 36:27.018
to the university
of wisconsin.

36:27.018 --> 36:28.019
Your saliva.

36:28.019 --> 36:29.020
Yeah.

36:29.020 --> 36:30.021

36:30.021 --> 36:31.623

Give it to me.

36:35.026 --> 36:36.228
Yes?

36:37.796 --> 36:39.298

36:40.266 --> 36:42.268
It's the dead guy!

36:42.268 --> 36:45.837

36:45.837 --> 36:47.038
Aah!

help me!

to kill you, o.K.?

i'm not going
to kill you, o.K.?

Jeez.

37:17.068 --> 37:18.470
I just want to know

37:18.470 --> 37:20.439
how I got this jacket.

37:20.439 --> 37:22.674
[Both talking at once]

37:25.677 --> 37:26.745
All right.

37:26.745 --> 37:27.879
All right.

37:27.879 --> 37:29.281
All right!

37:30.081 --> 37:31.082
Just you.

37:31.082 --> 37:32.484
We went to the warehouse

37:32.484 --> 37:34.152
with felix' brother steven.

37:34.152 --> 37:38.089
And we were playing
in there even though
we weren't supposed to.

37:38.089 --> 37:40.492
And we saw that
big metal thing.

37:40.492 --> 37:42.494
We thought it was
a submarine.

37:42.494 --> 37:44.496
We opened it up somehow,

37:44.496 --> 37:46.097
and you were inside.

37:46.097 --> 37:47.699
That's all, right?

37:47.699 --> 37:49.034
Right.

37:53.104 --> 37:55.507
There were
no guards there?

37:55.507 --> 37:57.443
No doctors? No one?

37:58.710 --> 37:59.645
No, sir.

37:59.645 --> 38:01.847
Just a bunch
of junk.

38:04.115 --> 38:05.551
Hello, ma'am.

38:05.551 --> 38:08.286
I was looking
for a gentleman
named harry finley.

38:08.286 --> 38:11.089
He used to live
around this area.

38:11.089 --> 38:15.293

you might be
related to him.

38:15.293 --> 38:17.128
No?

Thanks anyway,
ma'am.

experiments?

just asked me to
leave a message,

in my ear.

good wallpaper.

huge bike accident.

Thrashed.

40:55.987 --> 40:57.789
Totally thrashed.

40:57.789 --> 41:00.626
Look. I got
a big cut, too.

41:00.626 --> 41:02.761
Yep. It's going
to be a big scab.

But I won't
pick at it.

You'll want to write
to the national personnel
records center.

They deal with all
military records.

41:29.821 --> 41:33.424
They got a form.
It takes,
like, six weeks.

41:33.424 --> 41:36.027
Six weeks
is too long, miss.

41:37.228 --> 41:41.700
This is urgent.
I need to find
this man today.

41:41.700 --> 41:44.235
It's a matter
of life and death.

41:44.235 --> 41:45.236
For me.

41:47.038 --> 41:48.640
Please?

41:50.041 --> 41:51.176
Um...

41:53.444 --> 41:55.046
What did--who?

41:55.046 --> 41:56.214
harry who?

41:56.214 --> 41:58.249
finley. harry finley.

41:58.249 --> 42:00.051
1939?

42:00.051 --> 42:01.452
Yeah.

42:01.452 --> 42:03.722
That'd make him
pretty damn old, huh?

42:03.722 --> 42:07.158
Yeah,
i guess it would.

42:07.158 --> 42:08.560
Um, all right.

42:08.560 --> 42:10.261
I have a friend.

42:10.261 --> 42:14.332
He works at a locator
service in san antonio.

42:14.332 --> 42:16.267
Let me see
what he can do.

42:16.267 --> 42:19.671
It might take a couple days.
They get pretty busy.

42:19.671 --> 42:20.906
It's o.K.

42:20.906 --> 42:23.474
If you call me here
tomorrow after 12:00,

42:23.474 --> 42:26.044
that's when I get in.

42:26.044 --> 42:30.616
And if susan answers,
ask for me--debbie.

42:30.616 --> 42:33.484
I put my home number
on there, too,

42:33.484 --> 42:35.086
just in case.

42:43.161 --> 42:46.497
You can stay here
more than one night.

42:46.497 --> 42:47.565
Thanks.

42:47.565 --> 42:49.367
Peanut butter,
jelly, and banana.

42:49.367 --> 42:50.669
It's just
what I wanted.

42:50.669 --> 42:51.870
Told ya.

42:51.870 --> 42:53.371
Good.

42:53.371 --> 42:54.372
Ah.

42:54.372 --> 42:55.373
Drink?

42:55.373 --> 42:56.374
Yeah.

42:56.374 --> 42:57.709
Thanks.

42:58.509 --> 42:59.711
Dessert.

43:01.046 --> 43:04.850
And this is so you
can catch up on
history and stuff.

43:04.850 --> 43:06.517
I got it
for my birthday.

43:06.517 --> 43:08.519
No, you're going
to break it open.

43:08.519 --> 43:09.921
Don't do that.

43:09.921 --> 43:11.823
See, pull it off
like that.

43:11.823 --> 43:15.026
Put the straw
in that hole like that.

43:15.026 --> 43:16.027
See?

43:16.027 --> 43:17.062
Drink box.

43:17.062 --> 43:18.529
Thanks.

43:18.529 --> 43:20.131
So sweat.

43:20.131 --> 43:21.132
[Claire]
Guys?

43:22.133 --> 43:23.468
mrs. watson's here.

43:23.468 --> 43:25.603
O.K.!

43:30.141 --> 43:31.176
My mom.

43:31.176 --> 43:32.644
I figured.

43:32.644 --> 43:34.913
Hey, you like
my tree house?

43:36.547 --> 43:37.716
Sure. Swell.

43:37.716 --> 43:40.151
Cool. O.K. See ya.

43:55.533 --> 43:57.769
[Car pulls up]

44:00.405 --> 44:02.640
[Car door opens
and closes]

44:04.175 --> 44:06.111
[Claire]
fred.

44:06.111 --> 44:09.214
[Fred]
I hear you
been entertaining.

44:09.214 --> 44:10.015
Hmm?

44:10.015 --> 44:11.616
It's the mercedes guys.

44:11.616 --> 44:12.818
What are you doing?

44:12.818 --> 44:15.420
Well,
i thought i'd come by

44:15.420 --> 44:17.422
and see how you're doing.

44:17.422 --> 44:19.791
[Indistinct talking
continues]

44:25.596 --> 44:28.199
Stop it, fred!
No. Come on.

44:28.199 --> 44:29.600
fred, stop it.

44:29.600 --> 44:32.070
No, fred.
Stop it!

44:32.070 --> 44:32.871
Stop it!

44:32.871 --> 44:34.472
I just want to talk!

44:34.472 --> 44:35.673
Stop it!

44:37.108 --> 44:38.609
Stop it, fred!

44:38.609 --> 44:40.245
Hey!

44:40.245 --> 44:41.446
Stop it!

44:41.446 --> 44:42.447
Say, fella.

44:43.614 --> 44:44.983
O.K., all right!

44:44.983 --> 44:48.787
I think you ought
to take a walk
and cool off.

44:48.787 --> 44:49.988
Get out.

44:56.227 --> 44:58.329
Huh! Ha ha!

45:03.401 --> 45:06.738
Come on, now.
Come on.

45:55.253 --> 45:56.988
I was just
walking past, ma'am,

45:56.988 --> 45:59.324
and I heard you scream.
Uh...

46:01.860 --> 46:03.862
You o.K.?

46:04.996 --> 46:07.598
Are you--
are you o.K.?

46:07.598 --> 46:08.599
Here.

46:08.599 --> 46:10.601
You're shaking
like a leaf.

46:10.601 --> 46:12.203
Here. Sit down.

46:12.203 --> 46:13.604
Oh, so am I.

46:13.604 --> 46:14.605
You o.K.?

46:14.605 --> 46:15.606
Yes.

46:15.606 --> 46:16.607
Yeah?

46:16.607 --> 46:17.608
Good.

46:17.608 --> 46:18.609
Good.

46:18.609 --> 46:19.610
Yeah?

46:19.610 --> 46:20.611
Oh, dear...

46:20.611 --> 46:22.613
Uh...This yours?

46:22.613 --> 46:23.614
No.

46:23.614 --> 46:25.616
It must
have been his.

46:25.616 --> 46:28.019
i'm sure he'd want
you to have it.

46:28.019 --> 46:29.620
Oh, look,
you're bleeding.

46:29.620 --> 46:31.622
That's nothing.
That's just blood.

46:31.622 --> 46:33.624
No, no. Let me
clean it up.

46:33.624 --> 46:35.026
That's just a scratch.

46:35.026 --> 46:36.627
No, it's a gash.

46:36.627 --> 46:38.029
i'm a nurse.

46:38.029 --> 46:41.232
I know a gash
when I see one.
Sit down.

46:44.035 --> 46:46.237
[Car engine starts]

46:46.237 --> 46:48.039
[Tires squeal]

46:48.039 --> 46:51.242
You may have just
saved my life.

46:51.242 --> 46:52.243
Oh, no.

46:52.243 --> 46:53.845
Well, maybe.

46:55.213 --> 46:56.114
That prick!

46:56.114 --> 46:58.416
i've known
assholes
in my time,

46:58.416 --> 47:02.720
but this guy--
this guy could
give lessons.

47:02.720 --> 47:04.923
This is
going to sting.

47:06.657 --> 47:09.060
You see,
fred is a drunk.

47:09.060 --> 47:10.661
Which, by the way,

47:10.661 --> 47:12.663
is the least
of his problems.

47:12.663 --> 47:15.333
He's got no spine
and no decency.

47:15.333 --> 47:16.734
He's a punk.

47:16.734 --> 47:20.271
And I knew it
the day I met him.

47:22.673 --> 47:24.475
I know what
you're thinking.

47:24.475 --> 47:28.279
I haven't gone
out with him
in...Two years.

47:28.279 --> 47:29.480
Over that.

47:29.480 --> 47:32.683
Every once
in a while
he comes back

47:32.683 --> 47:35.753
like those storms
over in japan.

47:35.753 --> 47:40.091
You know, those
violent ones that
destroy the villages?

47:40.091 --> 47:42.027
Well, that's fred.

47:44.695 --> 47:46.831
Did you tell me
your name?

47:46.831 --> 47:47.832
daniel.

47:47.832 --> 47:48.833
daniel.

47:48.833 --> 47:50.701
I knew a danny once.

47:50.701 --> 47:52.703
Worse than fred.

47:52.703 --> 47:54.906
Well, maybe not.

47:56.707 --> 47:58.109
Ooh.

47:58.109 --> 48:02.480
So, daniel,
what do you do...

48:03.714 --> 48:05.116
Besides patrol
neighborhoods

48:05.116 --> 48:09.387
looking for signs of
domestic problems?

48:09.387 --> 48:11.689
i'm an air corps
test pilot.

48:11.689 --> 48:13.124
Oh.

48:13.124 --> 48:15.726
And in your off-time

48:15.726 --> 48:19.364
you go around
saving lives?

48:20.731 --> 48:21.933
That's it.

48:25.136 --> 48:28.739
Well...
My name's claire.

48:28.739 --> 48:31.009
In case
you were curious.

48:32.543 --> 48:36.347
"A scout never
shirks or grumbles
at hardship."

48:38.149 --> 48:40.351
What the hell
is "shirks"?

48:40.351 --> 48:43.754
For one thing,
they're both
mammals.

48:43.754 --> 48:44.755
Hey, guys.

48:44.755 --> 48:45.957
Hey, mom.

48:50.161 --> 48:52.163
i'd like you
to meet someone.

48:52.163 --> 48:55.400
This is my son
nat and his
friend felix.

48:55.400 --> 48:56.634
This is daniel.

48:56.634 --> 48:57.668
Hi, fellas.

48:57.668 --> 48:59.370
Hello.

48:59.370 --> 49:00.771
You guys o.K.?

49:00.771 --> 49:02.073
Yeah.

49:04.509 --> 49:06.244
daniel's a pilot.

49:06.244 --> 49:07.245
Wow.

49:07.245 --> 49:08.046
Cool.

49:08.046 --> 49:09.780
You're kidding.

49:09.780 --> 49:13.151
Hey, I see you
found your jacket.

49:13.151 --> 49:14.919
Still think you saw
a frozen guy?

49:14.919 --> 49:16.587
No.

49:16.587 --> 49:18.889
[Telephone rings]

49:18.889 --> 49:20.258
Excuse me.

49:22.693 --> 49:23.794
[Ring]

49:23.794 --> 49:25.530
What are you
doing here?

49:25.530 --> 49:26.797
Some jerk showed up.

49:26.797 --> 49:28.199
I got rid of him.

49:28.199 --> 49:29.934
Don't worry,
i'm leaving.

49:29.934 --> 49:31.902
Wait. The couch
is totally comfy.

49:31.902 --> 49:33.904
Or you could
have my room.

49:33.904 --> 49:35.706
I got a glow-in-the-dark
universe.

49:35.706 --> 49:39.410
Your mother's not going
to let a stranger
stay in the house.

49:39.410 --> 49:40.745
Want to bet?

49:41.546 --> 49:43.214
The toothpaste
is in the mirror.

49:43.214 --> 49:45.816
I think there's a new
toothbrush there, too.

49:45.816 --> 49:47.818
The towels
are under the sink.

49:47.818 --> 49:49.820
Nat, get him
a pillow, please.

49:49.820 --> 49:51.222
If you want hot water,

49:51.222 --> 49:52.623
turn the faucet to 4:00.

49:52.623 --> 49:56.827
When it gets warm, turn it
to 9, then back to 11.

49:56.827 --> 49:58.629
It's sort of like a safe.

49:58.629 --> 50:01.232
It's awfully kind
to let me stay here.

50:01.232 --> 50:03.234
I figured if you
wanted to kill me,

50:03.234 --> 50:05.636
you would've
let fred do it.

50:05.636 --> 50:09.040
Besides, you've got
an honest smile.

50:11.242 --> 50:13.644
Some people were born
with great legs.

50:13.644 --> 50:16.247
The rest of us
have to work at it.

50:16.247 --> 50:17.848
I did aerobics
till I dropped.

50:17.848 --> 50:18.983
Then I found thighmaster.

50:18.983 --> 50:19.984
Great legs.

50:19.984 --> 50:21.219
Thank you.

50:21.219 --> 50:22.687
Every time you
squeeze thighmaster,

50:22.687 --> 50:25.656
you strengthen and tone
right where you need it.

50:25.656 --> 50:28.859
So it's easy to squeeze,
squeeze your way

50:28.859 --> 50:30.961
to shapely hips and thighs.

50:30.961 --> 50:33.264
When these
muscle groups
get out of shape,

50:33.264 --> 50:34.865
the result
is flabby thighs.

50:34.865 --> 50:36.000
It's called television.

50:36.000 --> 50:37.402
Yeah, I know.

50:37.402 --> 50:40.805
I saw it at
the world's fair
in '39.

50:40.805 --> 50:44.041
That's why I recommend it
and use it myself.

50:44.041 --> 50:47.478
My problem with exercise
is finding time to do it.

50:47.478 --> 50:48.513
Night.

50:48.513 --> 50:49.880
Night.

50:49.880 --> 50:51.149
Thanks, thighmaster.

50:55.486 --> 50:56.887
daniel?

50:56.887 --> 50:58.289
daniel, get up.

50:58.289 --> 50:59.890
That guy
called back.

50:59.890 --> 51:01.292
He knows
a harry finley.

51:01.292 --> 51:04.095
Lives about an
hour from here.

51:09.900 --> 51:12.170
I got to go.
What time is it?

51:12.170 --> 51:13.171
It's 7:30.

51:13.171 --> 51:14.572
Wait. Before you go,

51:14.572 --> 51:17.242
we're going to
the wings of freedom.

51:17.242 --> 51:20.411
The air show--
it's near where
your friend lives.

51:20.411 --> 51:21.212
Morning.

51:21.212 --> 51:22.313
Morning, mom.

51:22.313 --> 51:23.714
Well, how was it?

51:23.714 --> 51:26.984
claire, you're one
of the kindest
people i've met.

51:26.984 --> 51:29.053
You haven't
seen my temper.

51:29.053 --> 51:30.921
Yeah. You haven't
seen that.

51:30.921 --> 51:32.123
Hey.

51:32.123 --> 51:34.091
How about breakfast?

51:34.091 --> 51:36.694
I got to meet
an old friend.

51:36.694 --> 51:37.728
I got to run.

51:37.728 --> 51:40.398
You sure? i'm a hell
of a defroster.

51:40.398 --> 51:42.733
No.
i'm late as it is.

51:42.733 --> 51:45.803
daniel, come
to the air show.
It's so cool.

51:45.803 --> 51:48.539
Nat, he said
he had to go.

51:50.541 --> 51:51.942
Well, goodbye.

51:51.942 --> 51:55.213
And thank you.
Thanks again.

51:55.213 --> 51:56.947
And good luck.

51:56.947 --> 51:58.316
You, too.

51:59.917 --> 52:01.152
Bye.

52:03.954 --> 52:06.191
Well, I guess
that's that.

52:22.573 --> 52:24.175
Thanks a lot.

52:26.311 --> 52:28.179
Thanks again.

52:31.982 --> 52:34.319
Yes?
May I help you?

52:36.854 --> 52:37.955
harry?

52:37.955 --> 52:39.457
Yes.
May I help you?

52:39.457 --> 52:42.393
Yes. i'm sorry, sir.

52:42.393 --> 52:44.595
Uh, you're not the...

52:46.864 --> 52:48.899
Are you o.K.?

53:12.022 --> 53:13.023
Sir?

53:13.023 --> 53:14.425
You got a ticket?

53:14.425 --> 53:18.396
You got to buy
a ticket over there. $12.

53:44.655 --> 53:47.258
Is it o.K.
To look inside?

53:47.258 --> 53:49.460
Sure, go right ahead.

54:03.841 --> 54:06.844
Hi, debbie.
This is, uh, daniel
from yesterday.

54:06.844 --> 54:10.881
Yeah. Well, I was hoping
maybe you heard something.

54:13.183 --> 54:15.185
Well, couldn't you
rush it?

54:15.185 --> 54:17.755
Uh, it's just that i--

54:18.923 --> 54:20.558
yeah. Sure.

54:20.558 --> 54:24.929
Yeah. Well, i'll--sure,
i'll try again later.

54:28.098 --> 54:30.601
[Crying]

54:37.775 --> 54:38.909
Hey.

54:39.977 --> 54:41.946
Quit following me, o.K.?

54:41.946 --> 54:43.481
Hi, claire.

54:43.481 --> 54:45.716
You find anybody
to rescue?

54:49.086 --> 54:52.590
You know,
i've been told...

54:53.524 --> 54:55.526
That I listen
exceptionally well...

54:55.526 --> 54:58.729
If you wanted
to tell me anything.

55:00.030 --> 55:01.666
You ever feel lost?

55:01.666 --> 55:04.502
I invented it.
It's mine.

55:04.502 --> 55:07.505
My buddy was supposed
to be here

55:07.505 --> 55:09.106
when I woke up.

55:09.106 --> 55:11.509
He used to live
around here,

55:11.509 --> 55:13.511
and I can't find him.

55:13.511 --> 55:15.513
I know that sounds
desperate,

55:15.513 --> 55:18.449
but he really is
all I have left.

55:18.449 --> 55:21.886
You could always
go home, right?

55:21.886 --> 55:24.889
I lost someone
close to me.
That's why I left.

55:24.889 --> 55:27.492
That's why I haven't
got any money
or clothes

55:27.492 --> 55:29.494
or a place
to stay.

55:29.494 --> 55:31.095
I just left and...

55:31.095 --> 55:33.097
And where i'd end up

55:33.097 --> 55:36.367
was the last thing
on my mind.

55:36.367 --> 55:38.703
Everything o.K.?

55:39.837 --> 55:41.406
john.

55:41.406 --> 55:43.641
Uh, yeah. i'm sorry.

55:43.641 --> 55:45.242
daniel, this is john,

55:45.242 --> 55:46.844
and john, this is daniel.

55:46.844 --> 55:47.878
Hi, john.

55:47.878 --> 55:49.914
Pleased to meet you.

55:49.914 --> 55:52.517
daniel is going
to be staying with us

55:52.517 --> 55:54.519
for a couple of days.

55:54.519 --> 55:56.421
Till he finds
his friend.

55:56.421 --> 55:59.424
Well...It's good
to know you,
daniel,

55:59.424 --> 56:01.659
good
to know you.

56:04.294 --> 56:05.696
Hi, this is debbie...

56:05.696 --> 56:08.298
Hi, debbie,
this is daniel mccormick.

56:08.298 --> 56:10.701
Leave a message.
i'll call back.

56:10.701 --> 56:13.303
Hi, debbie,
this is daniel mccormick.

56:13.303 --> 56:17.274
i'm staying
at 555-2368.

56:17.274 --> 56:20.645
Um, i'd
really appreciate it,

56:20.645 --> 56:22.246
if you hear anything,

56:22.246 --> 56:24.649
if you could
call me here.

56:24.649 --> 56:26.250
Thanks again
for everything.

56:26.250 --> 56:27.452
Uh, bye.

56:31.121 --> 56:32.122
Oh!

56:40.197 --> 56:41.599
Making dinner?

56:41.599 --> 56:44.201
Yeah. I got to do
something.

56:44.201 --> 56:45.402
Yeah.

56:47.538 --> 56:49.540
Hey, listen, I thought
maybe tomorrow,

56:49.540 --> 56:51.542
if you don't find
your friend,

56:51.542 --> 56:54.645
that maybe you could
teach me to fly.

56:54.645 --> 56:56.246
That might be tough.

56:56.246 --> 56:57.247
How come?

56:57.247 --> 56:58.949
Well, to begin with...

57:00.217 --> 57:02.620
I don't have
a flight jacket.

57:02.620 --> 57:04.188
And secondly...

57:04.188 --> 57:07.124
I don't have
a plane.

57:16.233 --> 57:19.470
My father left
when I was 1.

57:19.470 --> 57:21.872
Thought you might
want to know that.

57:21.872 --> 57:26.010
Well, I really don't
think that's any
of my business.

57:26.010 --> 57:28.412
He left when I was 1.

57:28.412 --> 57:31.048
He hasn't talked
to us since.

57:32.850 --> 57:33.851
Thanks.

57:39.089 --> 57:41.125
Can I help out?

57:44.795 --> 57:45.796
Yeah.

57:46.731 --> 57:48.533
Chop up this onion.

57:52.937 --> 57:55.673
Just the onion,
not the fingers, o.K.?

57:55.673 --> 57:57.875
I know. O.K.
Don't worry.

58:06.050 --> 58:07.518
Boy.

58:15.459 --> 58:16.927
Heh heh.

58:38.248 --> 58:41.852
Anyway, this guy
is covered in blood.
Covered, right?

58:41.852 --> 58:44.154
His heart has stopped.

58:44.154 --> 58:46.757
They have to open him up
right there,

58:46.757 --> 58:48.358
no time for procedure.

58:48.358 --> 58:49.760
So they open him up.

58:49.760 --> 58:51.762
I had to massage
his heart.

58:51.762 --> 58:54.765
I actually held his heart
and pumped it for him.

58:54.765 --> 58:57.367
There was this horrible
accident on the 5.

58:57.367 --> 58:58.769
There were other injuries.

58:58.769 --> 59:02.339
Anyway, this guy
whose heart i'm pumping,

59:02.339 --> 59:04.341
his eyes open.

59:04.341 --> 59:06.076
He looks at me,

59:06.076 --> 59:09.279
and he looks at his heart
and says,

59:09.279 --> 59:11.849
"you're holding my heart."

59:13.784 --> 59:15.519
What did you say?

59:15.519 --> 59:17.554
"Yes, I am."

59:18.589 --> 59:20.791
The anesthesiologist
almost passed out.

59:20.791 --> 59:23.127
Anyway, that was...

59:23.127 --> 59:24.528
Couple of weeks ago.

59:24.528 --> 59:26.563
Today, when I got
into work,

59:26.563 --> 59:29.566
he sent me a box
of chocolates

59:29.566 --> 59:31.268
shaped like a heart.

59:31.268 --> 59:33.303
Isn't that a good story?

59:33.303 --> 59:34.304
Great.

59:34.304 --> 59:36.106
No, this is great.

59:36.106 --> 59:37.374
[Doorbell rings]

59:37.374 --> 59:38.776
The scary thing is...

59:38.776 --> 59:42.179
That all of this
was in my cupboard,
lurking.

59:42.179 --> 59:45.549
Thank you
very much for taking
the boys to that.

59:45.549 --> 59:47.251
That was way above...

59:51.421 --> 59:53.390
We have a date...

59:53.390 --> 59:55.092
Tonight.

59:55.092 --> 59:56.493
Am I early?

59:56.493 --> 59:57.995
No.

59:58.763 --> 01:00:01.365
I was just trying out
daniel's cooking.

01:00:01.365 --> 01:00:02.967
It's good.
It's not bad.

01:00:02.967 --> 01:00:04.101
Want some?

01:00:04.101 --> 01:00:04.902
No.

01:00:04.902 --> 01:00:07.872
Um, i'll just be
a sec.

01:00:17.314 --> 01:00:18.315
Guys.

01:00:18.315 --> 01:00:19.316
Hey.

01:00:32.763 --> 01:00:34.932
So, you're a doctor?

01:00:34.932 --> 01:00:38.268
Yeah. Yeah.
That's right.

01:00:39.804 --> 01:00:41.806
I understand
you're a pilot?

01:00:41.806 --> 01:00:44.241
Yeah. Yeah.
That's right.

01:00:44.241 --> 01:00:45.642
Doctor, pilot.

01:00:45.642 --> 01:00:48.245
Yeah.

01:00:48.245 --> 01:00:49.246
Shit!

01:00:50.447 --> 01:00:51.448
Mom?

01:00:51.448 --> 01:00:54.218
claire,
are you all right?

01:00:54.218 --> 01:00:55.019
Yeah...

01:00:55.019 --> 01:00:57.221
i've just got
a waterfall

01:00:57.221 --> 01:00:58.622
in my closet.

01:00:58.622 --> 01:01:00.490
Get the spaghetti pot.

01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:01.491
Whoa!

01:01:01.491 --> 01:01:03.493
Aw, heck,
that's a leak.

01:01:03.493 --> 01:01:06.096
It's just a hole
in the roof.

01:01:06.096 --> 01:01:07.097
Just?

01:01:07.097 --> 01:01:09.299
We could do this
another night.

01:01:09.299 --> 01:01:10.267
No, john.

01:01:10.267 --> 01:01:12.737
Have you got hammers,
nails, shingles?

01:01:12.737 --> 01:01:14.739
Is there anything
i can do?

01:01:14.739 --> 01:01:16.006
Oh, wait.

01:01:16.006 --> 01:01:18.242
I can go
to the hardware store
tomorrow,

01:01:18.242 --> 01:01:21.245
get some things,
fix this in a jiffy.

01:01:21.245 --> 01:01:25.482
Go to dinner, you two.
Get out of here.

01:01:25.482 --> 01:01:27.718
Uh, o.K.

01:01:27.718 --> 01:01:29.720
Wait, um...

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:31.722
The roof will be
on fred.

01:01:31.722 --> 01:01:32.723
fred?

01:01:32.723 --> 01:01:34.024
fred. 9:00.

01:01:35.392 --> 01:01:36.593
i'm starving.

01:01:36.593 --> 01:01:37.728
Have fun.

01:01:37.728 --> 01:01:40.865
Yes, sir.
I understand, sir.

01:01:40.865 --> 01:01:44.869
I did. Yeah. It was just
a bad judgment call.

01:01:44.869 --> 01:01:46.904
The media
circus here...

01:01:46.904 --> 01:01:48.305
I understand, sir.

01:01:48.305 --> 01:01:51.909
i'm sure it will not
come to that. No.

01:01:51.909 --> 01:01:54.511
I am right on top
of it, sir.

01:01:54.511 --> 01:01:56.113
You'd better be.

01:02:45.562 --> 01:02:47.164
Can I help you?

01:02:49.934 --> 01:02:52.937
i'd like to sit here
for a moment,

01:02:52.937 --> 01:02:54.538
if that's all right.

01:02:54.538 --> 01:02:55.539
Sure.

01:02:55.539 --> 01:02:56.540
Thanks.

01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:04.141
Hi.

01:04:04.141 --> 01:04:05.142
Hi.

01:04:16.153 --> 01:04:18.355
Can I ask you
something?

01:04:18.355 --> 01:04:19.389
Shoot.

01:04:19.389 --> 01:04:22.192
Remember that girl
in the library?

01:04:22.192 --> 01:04:22.993
What?

01:04:22.993 --> 01:04:26.530
That girl
in the lib--alice?

01:04:26.530 --> 01:04:28.632
Yeah. Yeah?

01:04:28.632 --> 01:04:31.201
She's really cool.

01:04:36.306 --> 01:04:38.242
Plus she's
really pretty.

01:04:42.046 --> 01:04:44.348
So what was
your question?

01:04:45.249 --> 01:04:49.053
Well, felix says
i should make her
jealous.

01:04:49.053 --> 01:04:52.056
Says that's what
his brother does
with girls.

01:04:52.056 --> 01:04:55.192
Don't you think
you're a little young
to be...

01:04:55.192 --> 01:04:58.428
You ought to be thinking
about other stuff.

01:04:58.428 --> 01:04:59.663
i'm 10.

01:05:01.898 --> 01:05:03.600
I really like her.

01:05:08.005 --> 01:05:10.407
If I were you, um...

01:05:12.076 --> 01:05:15.079
i'd put her out
of my mind.

01:05:15.079 --> 01:05:16.680
Just forget about her.

01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:18.182
Trust me.

01:05:20.284 --> 01:05:21.351
Ohh!

01:05:21.351 --> 01:05:22.452
Ooh!

01:05:22.452 --> 01:05:24.021
Uhh!

01:05:24.989 --> 01:05:26.690
daniel!

01:05:26.690 --> 01:05:28.592
daniel...

01:05:28.592 --> 01:05:29.593
You o.K.?

01:05:29.593 --> 01:05:32.997
Yeah, yeah.

01:05:38.702 --> 01:05:39.869
Hey.

01:05:39.869 --> 01:05:41.305
Hey.

01:05:41.305 --> 01:05:44.241
Thanks for risking
your life to save
my underwear.

01:05:44.241 --> 01:05:47.244
I just lost my balance
up there today.

01:05:47.244 --> 01:05:49.846
You sure you don't
want to talk to john?

01:05:49.846 --> 01:05:51.848
He's a really good
doctor.

01:05:51.848 --> 01:05:53.850
Seems like a nice guy.

01:05:53.850 --> 01:05:56.453
Yeah, he's
a nice guy,

01:05:56.453 --> 01:05:58.055
nicest guy I know.

01:05:59.156 --> 01:06:01.992
Oh, this one's great.

01:06:01.992 --> 01:06:03.393
You like her?

01:06:03.393 --> 01:06:06.196
Yeah. Who doesn't like
billie holiday?

01:06:07.998 --> 01:06:10.867
You don't have
to put that on.

01:06:10.867 --> 01:06:12.269
It's o.K.
Nat's asleep.

01:06:12.269 --> 01:06:14.871
I just got
this cd player
for my birthday.

01:06:14.871 --> 01:06:17.274
Girls at work
gave it to me.

01:06:17.274 --> 01:06:20.277
I just think that
the old records

01:06:20.277 --> 01:06:22.479
sound better
somehow, don't you?

01:06:24.881 --> 01:06:27.284
I know there's
an e.Q. Thingy here,

01:06:27.284 --> 01:06:31.221
but I can never
figure out
what button to push.

01:06:31.221 --> 01:06:35.492
* the very thought of you *

01:06:35.492 --> 01:06:37.161
* and i'll forget... *

01:06:37.161 --> 01:06:39.129
she's incredible,
isn't she?

01:06:40.164 --> 01:06:44.701
* those little
ordinary things *

01:06:44.701 --> 01:06:49.406
* that everyone
ought to do *

01:06:49.406 --> 01:06:55.312
* i'm living in a kind
of daydream *

01:06:55.312 --> 01:06:59.216
* i'm happy as a queen *

01:06:59.216 --> 01:07:04.088
* and foolish
though it may seem *

01:07:04.088 --> 01:07:06.056
* to me *

01:07:06.056 --> 01:07:08.392
* that's everything *

01:07:08.392 --> 01:07:13.163
* the mere idea
of you *

01:07:13.163 --> 01:07:17.834
* the longing here
for you *

01:07:17.834 --> 01:07:23.207
* you'll never know
how slow the moments go *

01:07:23.207 --> 01:07:27.377
* till i'm near to you *

01:07:27.377 --> 01:07:29.879
* I see your face *

01:07:29.879 --> 01:07:32.682

I was wrong.

Before, about alice,
when I told you
to forget about it,

01:09:20.857 --> 01:09:22.292
that's all wrong.

01:09:22.292 --> 01:09:23.693
What about her?

01:09:23.693 --> 01:09:26.296
Well, you know how
you wanted to know

01:09:26.296 --> 01:09:28.031

to tell her.

01:09:30.899 --> 01:09:32.035

you see her,

It's hard, but you got
to do it. Let go.

01:09:53.790 --> 01:09:54.891
How?

01:09:54.891 --> 01:09:57.494
How? You know
that stuff

Do it for
a couple seconds.

You want to make sure fuel
gets to the engines.

01:14:01.370 --> 01:14:02.972

01:14:02.972 --> 01:14:03.807
Right.

Feather the props
and cut the mixture.

of these flaps.

01:15:30.393 --> 01:15:32.261

01:15:34.297 --> 01:15:36.265

Pull back. Not too much.
You'll flare up. Go easy.

01:15:46.175 --> 01:15:48.978
Just watch the horizon.
Watch the horizon.

Look at those indices.

some good news.

for a guy my age, right?

01:18:43.719 --> 01:18:45.121
It's not possible.

01:18:45.121 --> 01:18:48.457

left a message
on the machine,

01:18:57.100 --> 01:18:59.702
but I thought
it was a wrong number.

01:18:59.702 --> 01:19:01.537
It's still
on the machine.

01:19:01.537 --> 01:19:04.140
Maybe he was exposed
to some form of radiation.

01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:07.143
He's got what looks like
a mutated form of progeria.

01:19:07.143 --> 01:19:09.745
i've never seen
anything like this.
claire, he's aging.

01:19:09.745 --> 01:19:11.347
Is he going to live?

01:19:11.347 --> 01:19:12.882
I don't know.

01:19:12.882 --> 01:19:15.284
We have to get him
out of here.

01:19:15.284 --> 01:19:17.486
The fbi's coming.
Something's going on.

01:19:17.486 --> 01:19:18.621
I know.

01:19:18.621 --> 01:19:19.622
Stall them.

01:19:19.622 --> 01:19:20.623
What?

01:19:20.623 --> 01:19:21.958
Please?

01:19:22.859 --> 01:19:24.828
john, trust me.

01:19:30.199 --> 01:19:31.267
All right.

01:19:35.738 --> 01:19:37.206
Ahem. Yeah.

01:19:40.343 --> 01:19:42.445
Jump in.

01:19:42.445 --> 01:19:43.512
O.K.

01:19:43.512 --> 01:19:44.513
Thanks.

01:19:47.616 --> 01:19:48.617
Nat.

01:19:48.617 --> 01:19:50.219
Who are those guys?

01:19:50.219 --> 01:19:51.354
fbi.

01:19:51.354 --> 01:19:52.755
I think I can walk.

01:19:52.755 --> 01:19:55.191
Just shut up
and look sick.

01:20:02.331 --> 01:20:04.934
Oh, i'm dr. holby.
There's something
you should know.

01:20:04.934 --> 01:20:06.535
What is it,
doctor?

01:20:06.535 --> 01:20:08.337
Mccormick
has been moved.

01:20:08.337 --> 01:20:10.339
Nat, open the door.

01:20:10.339 --> 01:20:12.942
Yes, reception should have
told you. i'm sorry.

01:20:12.942 --> 01:20:15.211
He's now in the east wing.

01:20:15.211 --> 01:20:18.414
Make your first right.
East wing, icu.

01:20:18.414 --> 01:20:20.116
Room 144.

01:20:29.292 --> 01:20:31.494
i'm o.K., claire.
i'm all right.

01:20:31.494 --> 01:20:32.495
Sure?

01:20:32.495 --> 01:20:33.829
Yeah.

01:20:43.706 --> 01:20:44.840
Excuse me.

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:48.211
What the hell
is going on here?

01:21:09.232 --> 01:21:10.033
Yes?

01:21:10.033 --> 01:21:11.334
Hello, ma'am.

01:21:11.334 --> 01:21:13.536
i'm looking
for a man
named harry finley.

01:21:13.536 --> 01:21:16.906
He was a scientist.
His wife's name
was blanche.

01:21:16.906 --> 01:21:18.908
Uh, he was
from chicago.

01:21:18.908 --> 01:21:20.843
Do you know
this man?

01:21:20.843 --> 01:21:22.878
That's my father.

01:21:22.878 --> 01:21:24.280
Is he home?

01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:27.516
i'm--i'm sorry,
but my father is dead.

01:21:28.417 --> 01:21:32.021
He lived here once
for a couple of months,

01:21:32.021 --> 01:21:35.891
but he died
before I was born.

01:21:35.891 --> 01:21:38.995
You must be looking
for another man.

01:21:40.596 --> 01:21:42.598
I was his best friend.

01:21:44.333 --> 01:21:45.468
daniel?

01:21:45.468 --> 01:21:47.636
susan finley's
address is
14 cyprus pond road.

01:21:47.636 --> 01:21:50.239
Blue file says
her father first
found the problem

01:21:50.239 --> 01:21:51.840
two months
after mccormick
volunteered.

01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:53.842
finley died
in a chemical fire

01:21:53.842 --> 01:21:55.244
trying to save
his friend.

01:21:55.244 --> 01:21:57.846
Operations
claimed mccormick
was killed as well.

01:21:57.846 --> 01:21:59.248
They dropped
the file.

01:21:59.248 --> 01:22:00.749
There was
no investigation.

01:22:00.749 --> 01:22:03.652
The project slipped
through the cracks
during the war.

01:22:03.652 --> 01:22:05.054
So what
you're telling me

01:22:05.054 --> 01:22:06.455
is that he was lost.

01:22:06.455 --> 01:22:08.924
Mccormick was misplaced
for 50 years.

01:22:08.924 --> 01:22:10.726
That seems
to be the case.

01:22:10.726 --> 01:22:14.530
Inventory says
the capsule was
a water heater, sir.

01:22:14.530 --> 01:22:15.564
My god.

01:22:48.231 --> 01:22:50.966
Oh. Here they are.

01:22:51.967 --> 01:22:53.969
That's them, all right.

01:22:53.969 --> 01:22:55.038
"august...

01:22:55.038 --> 01:22:58.274
"september,
october, november...

01:22:58.274 --> 01:22:59.475
'39."

01:23:15.991 --> 01:23:17.460
"Irreversible."

01:23:19.762 --> 01:23:21.197
daniel...

01:23:50.759 --> 01:23:53.362
Here. These
might help.

01:23:57.666 --> 01:23:58.667
daniel.

01:23:58.667 --> 01:23:59.702
Hmm?

01:23:59.702 --> 01:24:03.106
I think we should
go back to the hospital.

01:24:03.106 --> 01:24:06.309
i'm sure there's
something they can do.

01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:13.682
That's her, isn't it?

01:24:16.385 --> 01:24:17.520
helen.

01:24:19.855 --> 01:24:21.624
Is that your child?

01:24:21.624 --> 01:24:23.058
No.

01:24:23.058 --> 01:24:25.361
We were never married.

01:24:29.698 --> 01:24:33.102
That's me
in the picture.
I was 2.

01:24:35.671 --> 01:24:37.873
That's impossible.

01:24:37.873 --> 01:24:40.909
She died
before you were born.

01:24:40.909 --> 01:24:42.778
daniel...

01:24:42.778 --> 01:24:44.580
helen's alive.

01:24:48.151 --> 01:24:49.752
That's where
we grew up.

01:24:49.752 --> 01:24:50.753
I know.

01:24:50.753 --> 01:24:52.155
When did she
move back?

01:24:52.155 --> 01:24:55.358
About seven years ago,
after her husband died.

01:24:56.892 --> 01:24:58.561
She was married?

01:25:01.730 --> 01:25:03.332
daniel, come on!

01:25:03.332 --> 01:25:05.468
I can't thank you enough.
Goodbye.

01:25:05.468 --> 01:25:08.971
Mom, maybe you should put
the car in drive.

01:25:08.971 --> 01:25:10.439
claire.

01:25:13.909 --> 01:25:15.110
Whoa!

01:25:36.131 --> 01:25:38.734
Mom, are we going
as fast as we can?

01:25:38.734 --> 01:25:40.102
i'm trying, nat.

01:25:40.102 --> 01:25:41.637
claire, claire.

01:25:41.637 --> 01:25:45.808
I don't think we're going
to make it in this car.

01:25:45.808 --> 01:25:48.311
I need an airplane.

01:25:48.311 --> 01:25:51.280
Oh, boy.
Nat, hold on.

01:25:54.850 --> 01:25:56.018
Whoa!

01:25:56.018 --> 01:25:57.320
Whoa!

01:25:59.288 --> 01:26:00.323
All right!

01:26:00.323 --> 01:26:02.758
Holy cow!
You drive like me.

01:26:08.096 --> 01:26:09.965
Hold on.

01:26:09.965 --> 01:26:12.635
Just dropping off
a pilot.

01:26:12.635 --> 01:26:14.169
Hey!

01:26:19.542 --> 01:26:20.776
Stay here.

01:26:24.780 --> 01:26:26.382
Nat...

01:26:40.729 --> 01:26:42.298
Goodbye.

01:26:46.935 --> 01:26:48.937
claire...

01:26:48.937 --> 01:26:50.339
Remove
the wheel blocks.

01:26:50.339 --> 01:26:53.676
i'll never ask you
another favor.

01:27:02.351 --> 01:27:04.553
You're holding
my heart.

01:27:05.954 --> 01:27:07.423
Bye.

01:27:09.358 --> 01:27:10.359
[Horn honks]

01:27:10.359 --> 01:27:12.328
Get out of the way!

01:27:14.963 --> 01:27:16.365
Excuse me. Watch it.

01:27:16.365 --> 01:27:17.966
Excuse me. Excuse me!

01:27:31.380 --> 01:27:33.248
Hey! Hey, hey!

01:27:36.819 --> 01:27:38.421
Cut him off!

01:27:39.254 --> 01:27:41.490
Hey, stop!

01:28:04.413 --> 01:28:06.815
Look, he hasn't
seen this woman
in 50 years.

01:28:06.815 --> 01:28:08.417
Hasn't he
been through enough?

01:28:08.417 --> 01:28:09.818
You'll get
your plane back.

01:28:09.818 --> 01:28:12.421
Why can't you just
leave him alone?

01:28:12.421 --> 01:28:14.823
We are not here
to hurt captain mccormick.

01:28:14.823 --> 01:28:17.426
Well, what
do you want him
for, then?

01:28:17.426 --> 01:28:19.828
A cup of coffee?
A little chat?

01:28:19.828 --> 01:28:23.031
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Walk this way, please.

01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:27.302
You know
how long it takes

01:28:27.302 --> 01:28:29.705
to get to the next
star system? 100 years.

01:28:29.705 --> 01:28:31.106
And that's
the closest one.

01:28:31.106 --> 01:28:33.842
You can't make that trip
without this technology,

01:28:33.842 --> 01:28:36.044
and right now
we're decades behind

01:28:36.044 --> 01:28:37.846
where finley got
in 1939.

01:28:37.846 --> 01:28:40.449
And daniel--
daniel is the only link

01:28:40.449 --> 01:28:43.051
between finley's work
and my own.

01:28:43.051 --> 01:28:45.454
That's not true.

01:28:48.290 --> 01:28:52.094
Everything you ever
wanted to know about
freezing someone.

01:29:00.202 --> 01:29:01.804
Oh, my god.

01:29:15.818 --> 01:29:18.421
What the heck
are you doing here?

01:29:18.421 --> 01:29:20.756
You forgot your jacket.

01:29:25.193 --> 01:29:26.795
Put your belt on.

01:29:26.795 --> 01:29:28.096
O.K.

01:29:39.975 --> 01:29:41.544
Ah...

01:30:00.563 --> 01:30:03.999
Can we at least
talk to them?
On the radio?

01:30:06.669 --> 01:30:08.871
We have
the craft on radar.

01:30:08.871 --> 01:30:10.873
i'm going
to see the capsule.

01:30:10.873 --> 01:30:12.875
Tell dr. reese
to get here.

01:30:12.875 --> 01:30:15.478
I also want the serial
ekg, cardiac enzymes,

01:30:15.478 --> 01:30:17.646
everything the hospital
did on mccormick.

01:30:17.646 --> 01:30:19.281
What about the plane?

01:30:19.281 --> 01:30:20.683
As soon as it lands,

01:30:20.683 --> 01:30:23.886
have an escort
take mrs. cooper
to get her son.

01:30:23.886 --> 01:30:24.987
Thank you.

01:30:24.987 --> 01:30:26.154
Thank you.

01:30:41.436 --> 01:30:43.972

* and foolish
though it may seem *

01:38:50.925 --> 01:38:55.197
* to me that's everything *

01:38:55.197 --> 01:38:59.867
* the mere idea of you *

01:38:59.867 --> 01:39:04.572
* the longing here for you *

01:39:04.572 --> 01:39:09.978
* you'll never know
how slow the moments go *

01:39:09.978 --> 01:39:14.149
* till i'm near to you *

01:39:14.149 --> 01:39:19.387
* I see your face
in every flower *

01:39:19.387 --> 01:39:23.625
* your eyes in stars above *

01:39:23.625 --> 01:39:26.628
* it's just
the thought of you *

01:39:26.628 --> 01:39:31.566
* the very thought of you,
my love *

01:40:31.393 --> 01:40:36.964
* I see your face
in every flower *

01:40:36.964 --> 01:40:41.169
* your eyes
in stars above *

01:40:41.169 --> 01:40:44.272
* it's just the thought
of you *

01:40:44.272 --> 01:40:49.211
* the very thought of you,
my love *

01:41:10.198 --> 01:41:15.570
* I see your face
in every flower *

01:41:15.570 --> 01:41:19.574
* your eyes
in stars above *

01:41:19.574 --> 01:41:22.777
* it's just
the thought of you *

01:41:22.777 --> 01:41:27.482
* the very thought of you,
my love **
