00:49.215 --> 00:51.885
EPISODE 9
ONE LUCKY DAY

00:51.968 --> 00:55.430
Player 218 and Player 456,

00:55.513 --> 00:58.099
welcome to the final game.

00:59.100 --> 01:03.897
Before we begin, we'll flip a coin
to decide who plays offense or defense.

01:04.856 --> 01:07.317
Please choose a shape. Triangle or square.

01:08.902 --> 01:09.944
Triangle.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.288
It's triangle.

01:20.872 --> 01:23.333
Please choose either offense or defense.

01:28.880 --> 01:30.048
Offense.

01:30.632 --> 01:32.675
Player 456 will play offense.

01:32.759 --> 01:34.761
Player 218 will defend.

01:47.357 --> 01:51.152
For the final game,
you'll both be playing Squid Game.

01:53.446 --> 01:54.906
Squid Game.

01:56.324 --> 01:57.867
What an odd name.

01:59.410 --> 02:01.496
It was originally
a children's game

02:01.996 --> 02:05.542
-that was played in Korea many years ago.
-Hmm.

02:05.625 --> 02:08.670
Let me explain
the rules of Squid Game.

02:08.753 --> 02:11.965
One, the attacker must enter
the squid shape court,

02:12.048 --> 02:15.635
run past the defense, and then tap
the area inside the squid's head

02:15.718 --> 02:17.303
with his foot to secure the win.

02:17.387 --> 02:20.807
Two, the defender must block
the attacker's advance

02:20.890 --> 02:23.852
and force them outside
of the court's bounds in order to win.

02:23.935 --> 02:26.229
Three, if a situation arises,

02:26.312 --> 02:29.816
in which either player is unable
to continue playing the game,

02:29.899 --> 02:32.026
the last one standing will be the winner.

02:39.159 --> 02:41.286
A player's unable to continue.

02:43.204 --> 02:44.622
Could you explain that?

02:45.623 --> 02:48.334
That would be
referring to the player's death.

02:50.253 --> 02:53.464
And now, with that, let the game begin.

02:58.428 --> 03:01.514
Among all the games
that kids played back then,

03:01.598 --> 03:04.017
it was the most physical and violent.

03:04.100 --> 03:05.852
So any kind of violence is allowed?

03:05.935 --> 03:07.896
Sure. There are no restrictions.

03:38.343 --> 03:40.428
Why is he hopping on one foot?

03:41.888 --> 03:43.973
The attacker
is given a handicap.

03:44.807 --> 03:48.561
He can only hop on one foot
until he crosses the squid's neck.

03:49.062 --> 03:51.105
Oh, so the defender tries to block him.

03:51.189 --> 03:52.273
Yes.

03:52.357 --> 03:54.651
That's the first challenge of this game.

03:58.738 --> 04:00.740
We always used to play this as kids.

04:02.158 --> 04:03.534
When we cross…

04:04.744 --> 04:06.704
do you remember what we used to call it?

04:06.788 --> 04:07.872
Shut up. Who cares about all that?

04:20.760 --> 04:22.220
Inspector royal.

04:25.390 --> 04:27.433
"Inspector royal," we called it.

04:52.583 --> 04:54.919
Mm. It sounds so romantic.

04:55.628 --> 04:56.629
What's it mean?

04:57.213 --> 05:01.217
"Good rain
knows the best time to fall."

05:01.301 --> 05:02.468
Du Fu.

05:09.809 --> 05:11.519
I put an end to her suffering.

05:12.270 --> 05:14.230
You know she would have died anyway.

05:14.981 --> 05:16.733
That's bullshit. Stop lying.

05:17.608 --> 05:19.110
She could've survived.

05:19.986 --> 05:21.446
They would've treated her.

05:22.447 --> 05:23.990
I know what you're like, okay?

05:24.574 --> 05:26.451
You're the reason that I had to kill her.

05:27.118 --> 05:30.955
I knew you two would stop all this,
so she didn't die in there.

05:32.582 --> 05:33.750
Was that it?

05:35.752 --> 05:37.420
You killed someone because this might end?

05:37.503 --> 05:38.421
Yeah!

05:39.213 --> 05:42.091
You and that girl would have been
the majority you needed to get out!

05:42.175 --> 05:44.552
Going home without a single cent.
I couldn't do that!

05:47.138 --> 05:48.639
She's the one who stopped me.

05:50.892 --> 05:52.977
'Cause I was gonna kill you with this.

05:59.067 --> 05:59.984
It's over.

06:02.528 --> 06:04.530
I won't let you leave here
with that money.

06:56.833 --> 06:58.042
You bastard!

07:36.247 --> 07:37.790
Die!

07:40.126 --> 07:41.127
Die!

07:41.794 --> 07:44.881
Get up! Get up! Get up!

08:39.810 --> 08:41.020
You recognized it?

08:42.230 --> 08:44.857
It's the damn place where they made us
play Red Light, Green Light.

08:45.566 --> 08:48.277
So many people played with us,
but now they're dead.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.321
Everyone except for us, Gi-hun.

08:54.158 --> 08:55.076
We…

08:56.035 --> 08:58.287
we've already come too far
to end this now.

09:34.991 --> 09:37.118
So it was you that killed them.

09:37.952 --> 09:40.121
You… you killed everyone!

09:41.497 --> 09:42.832
You killed them.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.793
You're the one who killed them.

10:42.850 --> 10:44.518
This game is over.

10:44.602 --> 10:46.604
Yep, that about wraps it up.

11:20.346 --> 11:21.347
I can't.

11:29.397 --> 11:30.856
I wanna end here.

11:40.074 --> 11:41.158
What is he doing?

11:41.242 --> 11:42.993
-What the hell?
-What's going on?

11:43.077 --> 11:44.745
Clause Three of the agreement.

11:45.955 --> 11:48.040
The players are able to end the game when…

11:48.666 --> 11:50.167
the majority agrees.

11:53.796 --> 11:55.589
So if we both give up now,

11:57.133 --> 11:58.676
you have to end it, right?

12:01.971 --> 12:05.599
Player 456 wants to stop the game.

12:06.600 --> 12:08.978
He's giving up the prize money

12:09.770 --> 12:12.773
right… right here
at the very edge of victory?

12:12.857 --> 12:14.859
No fucking way.

12:22.950 --> 12:24.076
Sang-woo.

12:26.203 --> 12:27.538
I just thought…

12:29.540 --> 12:31.542
how they used to call our names when…

12:33.502 --> 12:35.880
our moms had made supper for us.

12:39.216 --> 12:40.760
That won't happen again.

12:46.265 --> 12:47.391
Let's go.

12:53.689 --> 12:55.149
Let's go together.

13:11.832 --> 13:12.708
Gi-hun.

13:14.335 --> 13:15.920
I'm sorry.

13:26.722 --> 13:27.807
Sang-woo!

13:28.474 --> 13:31.143
Sang-woo…

13:32.645 --> 13:33.729
Gi-hun.

13:36.315 --> 13:38.192
No, Sang-woo. Don't talk.

13:38.275 --> 13:40.861
-My mother, go help her.
-Don't talk, Sang-woo.

13:43.572 --> 13:45.783
You have to help her.

13:46.617 --> 13:48.160
Ah… No. Don't…

13:48.661 --> 13:50.329
Sang-woo, don't…

13:50.412 --> 13:53.332
Oh, no!

14:00.798 --> 14:04.176
No! Sang-woo, no…

14:49.346 --> 14:50.639
You should celebrate.

14:51.599 --> 14:53.267
That was quite the game there.

14:54.685 --> 14:55.644
Why?

14:59.690 --> 15:02.484
Why did you do it? How can you?

15:04.069 --> 15:05.321
You bet on horses.

15:08.365 --> 15:10.034
It's the same here but…

15:10.868 --> 15:12.244
we bet on humans.

15:14.705 --> 15:16.081
You're our horses.

15:17.583 --> 15:19.335
I did not expect you to finish your race.

15:22.755 --> 15:23.756
Who are you?

15:25.633 --> 15:27.676
It was a dream. Just think of it that way.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.014
And it really wasn't a bad one
for you, either.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.016
Who are you?

15:40.522 --> 15:41.815
Who are you?

15:45.402 --> 15:46.737
Who are you?

15:50.783 --> 15:51.909
Who are you?

15:53.619 --> 15:55.204
Who are…

15:58.832 --> 16:01.794
Believe in Jesus or burn in Hell!

16:01.877 --> 16:04.838
You fool who deny the Lord's existence,

16:04.922 --> 16:06.090
repent now!

16:06.715 --> 16:09.009
The day of judgment is upon us!

16:09.093 --> 16:12.179
Followers go to Heaven,
non-believers burn in Hell!

16:12.262 --> 16:16.642
The only thing waiting for you
in the afterlife will be fire and pain!

16:16.725 --> 16:19.478
Let us repent
and kneel down before the Lord!

16:19.561 --> 16:23.732
Save yourself from Hell
by making Jesus your lord!

16:35.452 --> 16:38.455
BELIEVE IN JESUS

16:54.471 --> 16:57.641
Jesus. Praise the Lord.

17:18.203 --> 17:21.040

BALANCE: 45,599,990,000 WON

18:42.079 --> 18:43.080
Gi-hun!

18:50.712 --> 18:52.005
Are you…

18:52.089 --> 18:53.841
What happened? What's going on?

18:56.927 --> 18:59.263
Did you get into another fight
while drinking?

19:03.475 --> 19:04.768
Hold on. Wait right here.

19:16.864 --> 19:20.033
Here's some mackerel.
I know your mother may want it.

19:24.913 --> 19:28.792
She came down with something, I think.
She hasn't come out to work.

19:28.876 --> 19:31.545
And it's been a few days
since she's answered her phone.

19:31.628 --> 19:33.672
I should've stopped by to check on her.

19:34.214 --> 19:37.009
I just don't know what's wrong with me.
I mean, I, uh…

19:42.931 --> 19:44.183
It's all right.

19:44.808 --> 19:47.644
Give your mom any cash you got.
She needs it more than I do.

19:56.695 --> 19:57.863
Gi-hun.

20:01.325 --> 20:02.659
By any chance…

20:03.785 --> 20:06.705
have you heard anything recently

20:07.789 --> 20:08.916
from Sang-woo?

20:14.504 --> 20:15.631
Never mind.

20:16.924 --> 20:18.091
You should go.

21:22.739 --> 21:23.824
Hey, Ma.

21:24.825 --> 21:25.867
I'm home.

21:39.172 --> 21:40.257
Hey, Ma.

21:48.557 --> 21:49.850
Mom, are you asleep?

21:52.144 --> 21:53.145
Hey, Ma.

21:57.441 --> 21:58.859
Mom, I'm home.

22:02.863 --> 22:03.864
Come on.

22:09.286 --> 22:10.787
I came home, Ma.

22:16.585 --> 22:17.502
Hey, Ma.

22:19.671 --> 22:22.716
Just, just open your eyes.

22:26.094 --> 22:26.928
Come on.

22:38.607 --> 22:40.025
I'm home now, Mom.

22:43.487 --> 22:45.155
I got some money for us now.

23:44.756 --> 23:49.094
1 YEAR LATER

24:35.182 --> 24:37.934
We've got a real barista
working for us here,

24:38.018 --> 24:39.644
and he can make you a cup as well.

24:40.187 --> 24:42.147
I'm not sure if you'd like it that much.

24:42.230 --> 24:44.691
Why am I here to see you?

24:45.942 --> 24:48.612
Uh, sorry, you had to take the trip here.

24:49.362 --> 24:51.406
I wanted to have a car
sent out to you, but…

24:51.490 --> 24:52.908
Why am I here? What's wrong?

24:54.743 --> 24:56.036
Uh, well…

24:58.830 --> 25:02.918
So you see, you created your account here
quite a while ago and…

25:03.835 --> 25:06.713
and you haven't made that much effort
to contact us since.

25:10.300 --> 25:11.426
What do you mean?

25:14.054 --> 25:15.639
Did I do something wrong?

25:16.264 --> 25:17.265
Huh?

25:18.683 --> 25:22.229
Uh, uh, no. It's nothing like that, sir.

25:24.064 --> 25:28.360
Uh, you've got all your money set up
in a normal savings account.

25:29.236 --> 25:31.655
You weren't earning
all that much interest on it.

25:32.656 --> 25:37.536
And recently, our bank began offering
these consultations for VIPs

25:37.619 --> 25:39.871
looking to expand their financial assets.

25:39.955 --> 25:42.290
I wanted to let you know
that we're here to help.

25:43.333 --> 25:45.627
I'm sure you're keeping busy.
I just wanted to say…

25:46.169 --> 25:49.214
Oh. I'm sorry. Did I offend you?

25:51.466 --> 25:53.718
Could you help me out with something else?

25:53.802 --> 25:55.971
Okay, what can we do?

25:59.307 --> 26:01.560
Please spare me just 10,000 won?

26:03.186 --> 26:04.104
What?

26:04.980 --> 26:06.022
Uh…

26:06.815 --> 26:09.234
All right, yeah. Here, let me just…

26:12.946 --> 26:14.030
Um…

26:47.939 --> 26:49.274
Excuse me.

26:52.360 --> 26:54.154
Would you buy some flowers?

26:55.947 --> 26:57.240
Please, mister.

26:58.408 --> 27:02.162
I need to get rid of them tonight
or they'll end up wilting away.

27:09.711 --> 27:11.046
Thank you, mister.

27:12.547 --> 27:13.882
I appreciate it.

27:13.965 --> 27:15.842
Uh, here.

27:17.177 --> 27:18.470
Have a good night.

27:59.386 --> 28:02.138
DECEMBER 24, 11:30 P.M.
SKY BUILDING, 7TH FLOOR

28:02.222 --> 28:03.973
FROM YOUR GGANBU

29:55.251 --> 29:57.337
Pour some water in there.

30:05.220 --> 30:06.513
Please, Gi-hun.

30:29.035 --> 30:30.245
Who are you?

30:33.581 --> 30:34.958
You explain this.

30:45.969 --> 30:47.220
You see him?

30:48.012 --> 30:49.430
That man down there?

30:51.850 --> 30:53.560
He must be drunk…

30:54.853 --> 30:58.273
because he's been sitting there for hours.

31:00.024 --> 31:01.651
He looks homeless too

31:02.569 --> 31:04.362
if I had to guess.

31:04.946 --> 31:05.905
You…

31:08.741 --> 31:10.827
Were you the one who's behind it?

31:10.910 --> 31:14.831
He's going to freeze to death
if he stays out there any longer.

31:16.249 --> 31:19.002
And no one is going over
to help or anything.

31:19.085 --> 31:21.045
Why the hell did you do it?

31:24.424 --> 31:25.967
Would you help out that guy?

31:26.050 --> 31:27.260
Answer me!

31:28.595 --> 31:30.597
Why did you do that to us?

31:32.223 --> 31:34.642
You think that you will stop walking

31:34.726 --> 31:41.608
and help that disgusting, stinking drunk,
little piece of trash, huh?

31:41.691 --> 31:43.109
Show me who you are!

31:44.444 --> 31:46.195
Why did I get to live and no one else?

31:46.779 --> 31:47.780
Listen.

31:48.656 --> 31:50.533
Let's play something tonight.

31:53.077 --> 31:54.621
That man out there…

31:55.747 --> 31:58.291
if he remains out there until midnight,

31:58.958 --> 31:59.959
I win.

32:01.502 --> 32:02.670
If anyone…

32:04.797 --> 32:06.799
goes to help the drunk before then,

32:07.926 --> 32:09.761
in that case, you win.

32:11.971 --> 32:13.389
Cut the crap, okay?

32:15.767 --> 32:17.769
I could easily snap your neck right here.

32:17.852 --> 32:20.521
If you do that,

32:20.605 --> 32:24.192
then you won't get to hear
my explanation for all this.

32:24.692 --> 32:28.029
Play this game with me and…

32:28.821 --> 32:30.156
I'll give you the…

32:30.907 --> 32:32.867
answer to your question.

33:04.524 --> 33:05.984
And if I win…

33:08.069 --> 33:10.488
…then I'll kill you
without a second thought.

33:10.571 --> 33:15.618
What will you… bet on it with then?

33:16.202 --> 33:17.078
Anything.

33:20.164 --> 33:22.917
It doesn't matter.
You might as well take everything I have.

33:35.847 --> 33:36.931
So then…

33:38.266 --> 33:39.517
who are you?

33:39.600 --> 33:40.935
I earn…

33:42.395 --> 33:44.564
a living, lending out money.

33:45.064 --> 33:47.191
You give money to people for a living…

33:50.278 --> 33:51.821
…and you get rich doing it?

33:52.447 --> 33:53.906
Money.

33:54.824 --> 33:56.909
You know what making money is like.

33:58.202 --> 34:00.997
It's not simple to do.

34:02.665 --> 34:03.666
So then…

34:05.752 --> 34:07.795
was any of what you said true

34:08.963 --> 34:10.631
or was it all just a lie?

34:13.426 --> 34:14.469
Oh Il-nam.

34:16.054 --> 34:18.014
Is that even your real name, huh?

34:18.514 --> 34:19.599
It is.

34:20.308 --> 34:21.768
Yes, that's real.

34:22.477 --> 34:25.063
Oh Il-nam.

34:25.813 --> 34:27.565
That tumor's also real.

34:28.357 --> 34:31.986
And it also had gotten larger too.
That's true.

34:33.738 --> 34:34.906
And the house

34:35.907 --> 34:38.743
I used to live with my family in

34:39.786 --> 34:44.248
was almost exactly like that one
in the alley. That's all true.

35:13.027 --> 35:15.780
Can you still…

35:16.781 --> 35:20.034
trust anybody to be good

35:20.618 --> 35:23.329
even after everything you've been through?

35:24.122 --> 35:25.873
Why did you send a card?

35:26.874 --> 35:28.292
I heard that

35:29.460 --> 35:32.338
all the money you won
is just sitting there

35:33.339 --> 35:36.092
and that you are still living
like you used to.

35:40.012 --> 35:42.390
Is it all just because you feel guilty?

35:48.521 --> 35:49.814
Guilt? Shut up.

35:52.984 --> 35:55.695
You don't feel any guilt
for what you did, do you?

35:55.778 --> 35:57.321
It's yours now.

35:58.114 --> 36:00.158
That cash is your reward

36:00.950 --> 36:03.202
for your hard work and luck.

36:03.786 --> 36:07.540
And you have every right to use it now.

36:08.666 --> 36:10.251
Life goes by quick.

36:12.795 --> 36:14.255
In one minute…

36:16.507 --> 36:17.592
gone in a blink.

36:29.437 --> 36:31.439
Why did you do
something like this?

36:34.192 --> 36:35.359
Do you know

36:36.527 --> 36:39.488
what someone who doesn't have any money

36:41.157 --> 36:44.994
has in common with someone
with too much money

36:45.077 --> 36:47.163
to know what to do with?

36:51.876 --> 36:53.002
Living is…

36:54.045 --> 36:56.005
no fun for either of them.

36:59.050 --> 37:01.552
If you have too much money, then it…

37:02.511 --> 37:07.683
doesn't matter what you buy,
or eat, or drink, or whatever.

37:08.935 --> 37:13.439
Everything, well, it all gets boring.

37:16.359 --> 37:17.860
All of my clients,

37:18.361 --> 37:23.658
started to eventually say
the exact same things whenever we talked.

37:24.617 --> 37:26.035
Everybody felt…

37:26.619 --> 37:31.290
that there was no joy
in their lives anymore.

37:33.251 --> 37:37.004
And so, we decided to get together.

37:38.214 --> 37:40.549
We did a little bit of thinking.

37:42.051 --> 37:44.720
What could we all do to…

37:45.513 --> 37:48.266
finally have some fun?

37:48.349 --> 37:49.475
Some fun?

37:53.854 --> 37:55.815
You put us through all of that

37:57.525 --> 37:58.776
so you can have fun?

37:59.277 --> 38:00.403
It seems…

38:00.987 --> 38:05.533
that you forgot how… no one had to play,

38:05.616 --> 38:09.996
and you… all put your signatures
on the agreement.

38:11.622 --> 38:17.628
And that you all made your decision
to come back on your own.

38:29.640 --> 38:31.600
Well, he's still out there.

38:32.310 --> 38:34.895
It looks like you've run out of luck.

38:38.107 --> 38:39.358
Tell me…

38:40.443 --> 38:46.198
you still trust… in humanity being good?

38:47.867 --> 38:49.201
I wanna know…

38:50.453 --> 38:52.413
I wanna know why you joined us?

38:54.415 --> 38:56.751
Oh, well, in my childhood

38:59.003 --> 39:00.629
I always had

39:01.464 --> 39:05.426
so much fun out doing things
with all of my friends.

39:06.719 --> 39:10.056
We'd lose track of time for hours.

39:11.807 --> 39:13.309
I wanted to just…

39:14.393 --> 39:16.520
feel something

39:17.313 --> 39:20.608
just one last time before I die.

39:22.068 --> 39:26.947
And you are not going to get that feeling
if you are just going to spectate.

39:27.531 --> 39:30.368
And I desperately wanted that.

39:31.118 --> 39:32.244
And so…

39:34.914 --> 39:36.624
did playing do that then?

39:37.708 --> 39:38.834
Hell yeah.

39:40.336 --> 39:42.963
You asked why I let you live.

39:43.714 --> 39:45.341
By joining…

39:48.052 --> 39:49.970
and playing with you…

39:50.888 --> 39:52.890
I got that chance to…

39:53.849 --> 39:55.684
feel again.

39:56.644 --> 39:57.937
Thanks to you…

39:59.772 --> 40:02.233
I got to remember

40:03.317 --> 40:06.112
all these things that I had…

40:07.321 --> 40:09.615
forgotten long ago.

40:11.659 --> 40:14.703
It had been such a long time…

40:17.331 --> 40:18.707
since I…

40:20.584 --> 40:23.629
was able to have that much fun.

40:45.109 --> 40:46.444
Look at that.

40:48.154 --> 40:49.822
There's someone who cares.

41:33.115 --> 41:34.867
You saw that, didn't you?

41:38.537 --> 41:40.122
You saw that you lost.

42:13.864 --> 42:17.409
And our guests,
greet them for me, all right?

42:17.493 --> 42:20.371
Of course, sir,
but why not do it yourself?

42:21.705 --> 42:28.629
Because I know that I'm not going to have
as much fun watching as playing.

42:50.693 --> 42:52.236
INCREASE IN AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD DEBT
RANKING KOREA 2ND GLOBALLY

42:52.319 --> 42:55.906
The country's reported
household debt is rapidly on the rise,

42:55.990 --> 42:57.741
topping the current global average.

42:58.367 --> 43:01.829
Last third quarter, the Bank of Korea and
the Bank for International Settlements…

43:01.912 --> 43:02.746
Hmm.

43:02.830 --> 43:04.164
…reported that the GDP…

43:04.248 --> 43:06.500
Holy moly! Your hair, sir, grew out.

43:06.584 --> 43:08.210
Uh, what you're getting done today?

43:08.294 --> 43:10.170
Did you want a shorter cut?

43:10.254 --> 43:13.215
Or keep it longer
so we can perm it like that, huh?

43:13.299 --> 43:15.342
…Bank for international Settlements.

43:15.426 --> 43:18.220
The biggest increase in the world
besides China.

43:18.304 --> 43:21.390
The reason for the steep rise
in Korea's reported household debt

43:21.473 --> 43:23.058
is due, at least in part,

43:23.142 --> 43:25.978
to the lifted government restrictions
on financial loans.

43:34.486 --> 43:37.489
MINJI HAIR SALON

43:56.550 --> 43:58.010
You must be Cheol.

44:04.642 --> 44:06.268
The family resemblance is there.

44:11.106 --> 44:12.524
Sir, do you know…

44:14.151 --> 44:15.986
my sister very well?

44:19.531 --> 44:20.824
I know her.

44:23.869 --> 44:25.287
We're good friends.

44:25.788 --> 44:28.707
Does that mean you know
where she is right now?

44:41.512 --> 44:43.055
Is this the boy?

44:44.932 --> 44:45.974
Yeah.

44:48.435 --> 44:50.104
Tell me your name, sweetie.

44:51.438 --> 44:52.481
It's Cheol.

44:53.524 --> 44:54.858
Kang Cheol.

44:54.942 --> 44:56.819
Kang Cheol?

44:56.902 --> 44:59.029
How cool!
That's a manly name you have there.

45:00.114 --> 45:02.533
And you look so tough and strong.

45:03.867 --> 45:04.952
Take care of him, please.

45:05.536 --> 45:06.412
Okay.

45:07.204 --> 45:10.374
It'll be nice to have
a little extra company around

45:10.457 --> 45:11.875
for dinner for a change.

45:11.959 --> 45:14.253
Don't worry about me. Have a good trip.

45:14.795 --> 45:15.754
Thanks.

45:28.142 --> 45:30.144
Cheol, have you had dinner yet?

45:31.395 --> 45:33.814
Here, come. Come and take a seat.
Come on now.

45:33.897 --> 45:34.898
Have a fish bun.

45:36.316 --> 45:37.568
Here you go.

45:39.486 --> 45:42.865
Oh, goodness! That jacket
is way too light for this cold.

45:42.948 --> 45:44.575
Wait, don't you have a warmer jacket?

46:06.930 --> 46:08.891
IT'S THE MONEY I OWE SANG-WOO

46:15.522 --> 46:16.648
Gi-hun!

46:21.528 --> 46:22.738
Gi-hun!

46:24.239 --> 46:27.701
You have arrived
at Incheon Airport Terminal One.

46:27.785 --> 46:30.537
This is Incheon Airport Terminal One.

46:47.763 --> 46:50.098
Hey,
daddy's almost at the airport now.

46:50.891 --> 46:52.476
I'll be boarding the flight soon.

46:55.187 --> 46:57.606
Of course, of course, I got you a present.

46:58.774 --> 47:01.151
No way. It's a secret.

47:02.027 --> 47:03.946
I'll show it to you in person.

47:08.867 --> 47:10.202
Hold on, Ga-yeong.

47:11.620 --> 47:14.289
Ga-yeong, I'm gonna call you back
once I get there, okay?

47:16.124 --> 47:17.751
I'll be there soon, honey.

47:27.302 --> 47:29.805
Let's play again. Right now!

48:18.061 --> 48:20.522
What the hell are you doing?

48:21.815 --> 48:23.191
Give me back that card!

48:23.275 --> 48:25.569
-Oh!
-No. You don't.

48:25.652 --> 48:27.613
You don't go!

48:30.449 --> 48:34.244
This is the final
boarding call for U-Way Airlines.

48:34.328 --> 48:40.918
Boarding for U-Way Flight 202
to Los Angeles will close shortly.

48:41.001 --> 48:43.295
All passengers bound for Los Angeles,

48:43.378 --> 48:47.049
please make your way
to Gate 22 immediately.

48:47.132 --> 48:48.717
Ladies and gentlemen…

48:48.800 --> 48:50.510
…this is the final boarding call.

49:32.469 --> 49:34.513
Do you wish to participate in the game?

49:35.305 --> 49:38.892
If you wish to play,
please state your name and date of birth.

49:40.352 --> 49:41.603
Seong Gi-hun.

49:43.188 --> 49:45.732
October 31, 1974.

49:49.945 --> 49:51.238
Listen carefully.

49:53.240 --> 49:54.658
I'm not a horse.

49:56.201 --> 49:57.452
I'm a person.

49:59.663 --> 50:01.206
That's why I wanna know…

50:03.417 --> 50:05.002
…who you people are,

50:08.255 --> 50:11.008
and how you can do
these horrible things to people.

50:11.550 --> 50:13.010
Player 456.

50:13.719 --> 50:15.470
Don't get any absurd ideas.

50:15.971 --> 50:17.180
It wasn't a dream.

50:18.974 --> 50:20.475
I can't forgive you…

50:22.227 --> 50:23.895
for everything you're doing.

50:24.563 --> 50:27.858
Just get on that plane.
It's for your own good.
