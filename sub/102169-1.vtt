1:56:06.375 --> 1:56:08.667
We need to talk about these papers, honey.

1:56:39.542 --> 1:56:41.292
‐ My friend's a nurse here.

1:56:43.167 --> 1:56:44.792
Jimmy, they're going
to take her off Methadone

1:56:44.792 --> 1:56:46.375
and she's in withdrawal.

1:56:47.958 --> 1:56:49.750
[crying] If they do it,
they're going to kill her.

1:56:49.750 --> 1:56:51.792
So you have to do something, Jimmy,

She hasn't been well, but she's sorry

1:57:36.875 --> 1:57:38.208
and she's ready to help.

1:57:40.750 --> 1:57:44.333

1:58:02.500 --> 1:58:03.625
We know that.

1:58:06.875 --> 1:58:08.583

1:58:09.917 --> 1:58:12.625
‐ Go ahead and tell 'em
what you need to tell 'em, baby.

1:58:14.458 --> 1:58:17.458
‐ Ms. Holiday,
you want to clear your name, right?

1:58:20.583 --> 1:58:24.000
Get us off your case
and you'll never see us again.

1:58:34.000 --> 1:58:35.958
‐ You think I'm going
to stop singing that song?

1:58:45.375 --> 1:58:47.625
Your grandkids
will be singing <i>Strange Fruit.</i>

1:58:54.375 --> 1:58:57.625
