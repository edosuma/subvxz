WEBVTT

01:05.316 --> 01:07.151
- Watch your step, sir.
- Thank you.

01:15.243 --> 01:16.452
Go ahead, sir

02:01.789 --> 02:03.541
<i>how about some gold plastic?</i>

02:08.086 --> 02:10.298
<i>Told her that?
She's her boss.</i>

02:27.106 --> 02:29.775
<i>You asshole!
What do you take me for?</i>

02:29.984 --> 02:31.861
About a hundred bucks.

02:36.907 --> 02:37.908
Excuse me, sir.

02:38.117 --> 02:40.077
Hey, fucker, get the
fuck away from him.

02:40.286 --> 02:41.370
Fuck you, man.

02:44.123 --> 02:46.334
Let go, dammit!
Let me fucking go!

02:46.917 --> 02:49.670
<i>Fuck, get off of me!
You fucker, get off of me!</i>

02:51.505 --> 02:54.008
I think it's time for
you gentlemen to leave.

02:54.216 --> 02:55.968
It's all right.

02:56.177 --> 02:58.220
We were just having
a little fun.

02:58.429 --> 03:00.097
<i>It's okay.
I'm sorry.</i>

03:06.729 --> 03:10.441
[ Crowd gasps 1

03:10.650 --> 03:13.235
<i>back up, fuckhead.</i>

03:13.444 --> 03:17.239
Okay, Dalton, I've
always wanted to try you.

03:17.448 --> 03:19.867
I think I can take you.

03:20.076 --> 03:21.410
Outside.

03:25.539 --> 03:26.791
Ok.

03:27.041 --> 03:28.918
So here we are, let's go.

03:29.085 --> 03:31.921
- Come on, hotshot.
- Come on! Come on, let's do it.

03:32.129 --> 03:33.547
Dirtball, where you going?

03:33.756 --> 03:35.925
- Hey, moose-lips, get back here!
- Dickhead!

03:36.133 --> 03:38.052
What are you guys, the
seven dwarfs or something?

04:16.632 --> 04:18.509
Can I talk to
you for a minute?

04:19.593 --> 04:21.178
Name's Dalton, right?

04:22.179 --> 04:24.140
I don't know you.

04:24.348 --> 04:26.142
My name is tilghman.

04:26.350 --> 04:27.977
Frank tilghman.

04:29.311 --> 04:31.188
I have a little club
outside of Kansas City

04:31.397 --> 04:33.232
called the double deuce.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.822
It used to be a sweet deal.

04:41.031 --> 04:45.161
Now it's the kind of place where they
sweep up the eyeballs after closing.

04:46.412 --> 04:49.081
Anyway, I've come into
a little bit of money.

04:50.791 --> 04:53.294
I'd like to make a
better life for myself.

04:54.336 --> 04:57.214
I need somebody to help
me clean the place up.

04:58.257 --> 04:59.925
I need the best.

05:00.468 --> 05:04.305
- Wade Garrett's the best.
- Wade Garrett's getting old.

05:04.513 --> 05:06.390
He's still the best.

05:06.599 --> 05:08.142
I want you.

05:14.774 --> 05:17.318
$5,000 up front.
$500 a night, cash.

05:17.526 --> 05:19.779
You pay all medical expenses.

05:21.113 --> 05:22.990
I can live with that.

05:24.784 --> 05:27.369
I run the show. Completely.

05:28.746 --> 05:30.456
When the job's done, I walk.

05:30.664 --> 05:33.000
I've got your plane
ticket right here.

05:34.001 --> 05:35.336
I don't fly.

05:37.505 --> 05:38.839
Too dangerous.

05:40.216 --> 05:44.136
- Well, when do I expect you-
- don't. I'll get there.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.933
Dalton, you all right?

05:49.141 --> 05:50.893
It's just a scratch.

05:51.101 --> 05:53.938
By the way, Oscar,
bandstand's all yours.

05:54.146 --> 05:55.564
What's that supposed to mean?

05:55.773 --> 05:57.066
I'm outta here.

05:58.067 --> 05:59.360
Great.

06:02.780 --> 06:06.116
You know, I thought you'd be...

06:06.325 --> 06:07.576
Bigger.

06:34.728 --> 06:35.813
Yo.

06:38.732 --> 06:41.485
- What do I look like, a valet?
- Keep it. It's yours.

06:41.694 --> 06:42.611
Hm?

07:39.793 --> 07:42.004
Oh, a Mercedes!

07:46.133 --> 07:50.596
Hey, hotshot,
what's wrong with Detroit cars?

07:57.311 --> 07:58.687
Come on!

08:00.397 --> 08:02.608
Don't come back, peckerhead.

08:14.286 --> 08:16.747
Bring on the real band!

08:30.594 --> 08:31.971
Son of a bitch!

08:36.850 --> 08:38.394
Yo, Steve.

08:39.561 --> 08:41.647
Fuck 'em. They're brothers.

08:41.855 --> 08:44.232
Goddamnit, you're ripping my
best fuckin' shirt.

08:44.441 --> 08:46.568
You know, I get off at two,

08:46.777 --> 08:49.363
and I'd just love to get you off

08:49.571 --> 08:52.116
about a half an hour
after that.

08:53.158 --> 08:55.327
By god, you're a
put-together woman.

08:57.121 --> 08:59.289
Ladies first, asshole.

09:00.165 --> 09:01.917
Come over here, baby. Hey!

09:02.126 --> 09:04.712
Hey, baby, come and have
fun with us a little while.

09:04.920 --> 09:07.256
Damn it. Mongrel!

09:10.300 --> 09:12.511
Making a damn mess.

09:19.018 --> 09:22.187
Oh, Jesus, not here.
Follow me to the bathroom.

09:38.620 --> 09:39.997
I need a drink.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.333
One, two, three, four.

09:51.759 --> 09:54.178
- Vodka rocks.
- You got it, baby.

09:55.971 --> 09:57.806
Hey, vodka rocks.

09:58.849 --> 10:02.853
What do you say you and
me get nipple to nipple?

10:04.605 --> 10:06.899
I can do that without you.

10:17.534 --> 10:19.495
Get him out of here, now.

10:19.703 --> 10:21.955
Come on, man, get
your hands off me.

10:24.750 --> 10:27.044
You're not drinking.
You're outta here.

10:31.757 --> 10:34.426
Hey! Don't let him bother you.

10:34.635 --> 10:37.346
Morgan was born an asshole
and just grew bigger.

10:39.264 --> 10:40.724
I'm Carrie Ann.

10:41.600 --> 10:43.268
If you need anything,

10:44.436 --> 10:46.939
anything, you just let me know.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.195
You got a name?

10:54.196 --> 10:55.322
Yeah.

10:57.449 --> 10:59.201
Well, what is it?

11:01.995 --> 11:03.122
Dalton.

11:04.748 --> 11:06.166
Oh, my god.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.128
Shit. I heard of you.

11:09.336 --> 11:10.754
Carrie Ann!

11:10.963 --> 11:12.506
What are you waiting for?
Christmas?

11:13.465 --> 11:15.926
- Move!
- Oh, shut up. I'm goin'.

11:16.135 --> 11:17.469
Jesus Christ.

11:22.015 --> 11:24.977
<i>R well, you can't
pull the wool over me,</i>

11:44.955 --> 11:48.959
- get him out of here.
- Let's go, sleeping beauty.

11:50.836 --> 11:52.588
Come on, move it.

11:52.796 --> 11:53.922
Come on.

11:54.131 --> 11:56.091
What do you think
this is, a rest home?

12:04.892 --> 12:08.228
All right, y'all, we'll be back in ten.
We gotta drain the main vein.

12:08.437 --> 12:11.773
- Stick around.
- Hey, you're paid to play. Play.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.151
Fuck!

12:42.888 --> 12:44.264
Thanks, man.

12:44.473 --> 12:47.142
Thought you played pretty
good for a blind, white boy.

12:47.351 --> 12:49.311
Yeah, and I thought
you'd be bigger.

12:51.146 --> 12:53.649
Dalton, how ya doin'?
It's good to see ya.

12:53.815 --> 12:55.025
Same here, man.

12:55.234 --> 12:57.986
The boys and I heard you
were coming into town.

12:58.195 --> 13:00.155
Man, this toilet is
worse than the one that

13:00.364 --> 13:01.657
we worked in Dayton.

13:01.865 --> 13:03.992
- Really?
'Oh! Maâ€œ!

13:04.201 --> 13:07.537
It's a mean scene
around here, man.

13:07.746 --> 13:10.540
There's blood on the floor
in this joint every night.

13:10.749 --> 13:12.125
Hey Hank, you
know who that is?

13:12.334 --> 13:14.336
- Who?
- Dalton.

13:14.544 --> 13:17.047
<i>R gonna tell aunt
Mary about uncle John</i>

13:27.391 --> 13:29.935
that guy at the end of the
bar is fucking Dalton, man.

13:32.980 --> 13:34.856
He killed a guy once.

13:35.816 --> 13:38.235
Ripped his throat right out.

13:39.278 --> 13:40.529
Bullshit.

13:41.947 --> 13:44.783
- What ya need, buddy?
- Coffee, black.

13:49.871 --> 13:52.207
Ever seen a better
pair of attitudes?

13:53.375 --> 13:55.043
Fine, ain't they?

13:55.252 --> 13:59.881
I'll tell you what, for 20 bucks,
you can kiss 'em.

14:00.090 --> 14:01.591
Are you kidding?

14:01.800 --> 14:03.760
$10 a kiss. Here and now.

14:04.803 --> 14:08.390
Go ahead. Do it, go on.
Go on.

14:08.598 --> 14:10.642
Come on. Come on.

14:13.395 --> 14:15.397
$10 a kiss. Go ahead.

14:23.030 --> 14:24.281
Yeah!

14:26.491 --> 14:29.077
Hey, buddy, what are you doin'?
Are you gonna kiss 'em or not?

14:30.746 --> 14:31.872
I can't.

14:32.497 --> 14:36.460
- What do you mean, you can't?
- I ain't got 20 bucks.

14:38.128 --> 14:39.254
What? You...

14:44.468 --> 14:45.844
Oh, shit.

14:46.053 --> 14:47.179
Fight!

14:53.060 --> 14:54.603
Break it up!

15:22.005 --> 15:23.590
You son of a bitch!

15:32.766 --> 15:33.975
Bastard!

16:20.730 --> 16:23.233
Fuck.
Anybody got a mirror?

16:25.861 --> 16:27.237
Aw, shit.

16:31.408 --> 16:34.911
Hey, how'd you like to tell us
what the fuck's goin' on?

16:35.120 --> 16:36.872
You gonna help us out or not?

16:37.080 --> 16:38.540
I'll let you know.

16:38.748 --> 16:40.333
You know, I heard you
had balls big enough

16:40.542 --> 16:42.377
to come in a dump truck, but...

16:42.586 --> 16:45.046
You don't look like much to me.

16:47.215 --> 16:48.675
Opinions vary.

16:54.139 --> 16:56.099
- Cody. Later.
- Dalton.

16:56.558 --> 16:59.436
- All right, man. You take care.
- See you guys.

17:03.273 --> 17:05.608
This Dalton character,
what's his story?

17:05.817 --> 17:09.237
The story is you fuck with
him and he'll seal your fate.

17:09.445 --> 17:10.446
Yeah?

17:10.655 --> 17:13.116
So far he hasn't shown me shit.

17:36.348 --> 17:37.724
She's a runner.

17:44.231 --> 17:46.566
- These work?
- Sure do.

17:47.567 --> 17:50.487
<i>Jimmy, you have a customer
waiting for you on the lot.</i>

17:51.738 --> 17:53.782
<i>Jimmy, you have a
customer on the lot.</i>

17:55.575 --> 17:56.993
I'll take it.

18:57.012 --> 18:58.346
Morning.

18:59.347 --> 19:01.349
You the one who's
got a room to rent?

19:04.311 --> 19:05.729
Come on.

19:13.194 --> 19:14.738
You honest?

19:14.946 --> 19:16.364
Yes, sir.

19:16.865 --> 19:18.575
You expect me to believe that?

19:19.409 --> 19:20.910
No, sir.

19:47.354 --> 19:48.813
Goddammit!

20:17.676 --> 20:21.388
I swear he does that
just to piss me off.

20:21.596 --> 20:23.682
- Who does?
- Brad Wesley.

20:31.564 --> 20:34.275
- Hello, baby.
- Like horses, do you?

20:35.235 --> 20:36.778
If they like me.

20:36.986 --> 20:38.530
You wouldn't steal
'em, would you?

20:38.738 --> 20:39.823
No, sir.

20:41.116 --> 20:42.534
Calling me sir is like

20:42.742 --> 20:45.995
putting an elevator in an
outhouse, don't belong.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.206
I'm Emmet.

20:48.415 --> 20:49.958
I'm Dalton.

21:03.138 --> 21:05.140
So what do you think?

21:05.348 --> 21:07.517
Well, I'll take it.

21:11.354 --> 21:14.274
Must've been 20 people look
at that room this past year.

21:14.482 --> 21:17.110
No phone, no television,
no conditioned air,

21:17.318 --> 21:19.529
no tolerance for the
fragrance of nature.

21:20.655 --> 21:23.408
Nobody wanted it.
How come you do?

21:24.784 --> 21:27.036
You're just too
persuasive for me, I guess.

21:28.246 --> 21:30.665
It ain't the money, you understand,
but if I don't charge you something,

21:30.874 --> 21:34.169
the presbyterians around here
are likely to pray for my ruination.

21:34.961 --> 21:37.005
How does a hundred dollars
a month strike you?

21:37.922 --> 21:39.257
Fine.

21:39.758 --> 21:41.426
You can afford that much?

21:42.635 --> 21:45.096
If it keeps you in the
good graces of the church.

21:45.305 --> 21:48.725
Ain't it peculiar how money
seems to do that very thing?

21:50.518 --> 21:53.938
Now, this.
This is a new double deuce.

21:55.148 --> 21:57.442
I've put a lot of money
and time into this.

21:57.650 --> 21:58.735
And to protect my investment,

21:58.943 --> 22:01.946
I've hired the best damn
cooler in the business.

22:02.906 --> 22:05.033
From now on he's in charge
of all the bar business.

22:05.241 --> 22:07.160
What he says goes.

22:08.995 --> 22:10.288
Dalton?

22:18.546 --> 22:20.882
Morgan, you're out of here.

22:21.090 --> 22:22.383
What the fuck
you talking about?

22:22.592 --> 22:24.677
You don't have the right
temperament for the trade.

22:25.595 --> 22:26.721
You asshole!

22:26.930 --> 22:29.808
- What am I supposed to do?
- There's always barber college.

22:35.230 --> 22:36.856
You're a dead man.

22:48.535 --> 22:52.121
You're out, too.
We're selling booze here, not drugs.

22:55.166 --> 22:56.543
Thank you.

23:01.172 --> 23:03.466
Anybody else here dealing?

23:04.884 --> 23:07.637
I'm telling you straight.

23:07.846 --> 23:09.973
It's my way or the highway.

23:11.391 --> 23:14.352
So anybody wants
to walk, do it now.

23:24.070 --> 23:25.321
All right.

23:28.658 --> 23:29.784
People who really wanna have

23:29.993 --> 23:32.412
a good time won't come
to a slaughterhouse.

23:32.620 --> 23:35.915
And we've got entirely too
many troublemakers here.

23:36.124 --> 23:41.170
Too many 40-year-old
adolescents, felons, power drinkers,

23:41.421 --> 23:43.631
and trustees of
modern chemistry.

23:44.382 --> 23:46.175
It's going to change.

23:46.384 --> 23:48.720
Man, that sure sounds good.

23:48.928 --> 23:50.722
But a lot of the guys
who come in here,

23:50.930 --> 23:53.057
we can't handle one-on-one.

23:53.266 --> 23:54.684
Even two-on-one.

23:54.893 --> 23:56.519
Don't worry about it.

23:56.728 --> 23:59.063
All you have to do is
follow three simple rules.

23:59.272 --> 24:02.817
One: Never underestimate
your opponent.

24:03.026 --> 24:05.028
Expect the unexpected.

24:05.945 --> 24:08.281
Two: Take it outside.

24:08.489 --> 24:10.450
Never start anything
inside the bar

24:10.658 --> 24:13.912
unless it's absolutely necessary.

24:14.120 --> 24:16.831
And three: Be nice.

24:17.790 --> 24:19.000
Come on.

24:19.667 --> 24:22.503
If somebody gets in your face
and calls you a cocksucker,

24:22.712 --> 24:24.464
I want you to be nice.

24:25.340 --> 24:26.507
Okay-

24:27.967 --> 24:31.012
ask him to walk, be nice.

24:31.304 --> 24:32.972
If he won't walk, walk him.

24:33.181 --> 24:34.474
But be nice.

24:34.682 --> 24:37.226
If you can't walk him, one
of the others will help you.

24:37.435 --> 24:39.312
And you'll both be nice.

24:41.564 --> 24:45.109
I want you to remember
that it's a job.

24:45.944 --> 24:47.737
It's nothing personal.

24:47.946 --> 24:51.616
Uh-huh, being called a
cocksucker isn't personal?

24:52.533 --> 24:53.910
No.

24:54.118 --> 24:58.164
It's two nouns combined to
elicit a prescribed response.

24:59.666 --> 25:02.168
I wonder what if somebody
calls my mama a whore?

25:03.127 --> 25:04.212
Is she?

25:08.341 --> 25:10.134
I want you to be nice,

25:11.511 --> 25:14.639
until it's time to not be nice.

25:15.682 --> 25:19.519
Well, how're we supposed
to know when that is?

25:19.727 --> 25:22.563
You won't.
I'll let you know.

25:22.772 --> 25:25.233
You are the bouncers.
I am the cooler.

25:25.441 --> 25:28.528
All you have to do is watch
my back and each others'.

25:29.737 --> 25:31.197
Take out the trash.

25:49.966 --> 25:51.342
This is a sears credit card.

25:51.551 --> 25:54.095
- Beverly, Agnes.
- Hi, Steve.

25:54.303 --> 25:55.847
It's okay, bear.
They're friends of mine.

25:56.055 --> 25:57.432
- Hey, but Dalton said-
- it's okay. Trust me.

25:57.640 --> 25:59.308
Right this way, girls.

26:04.147 --> 26:06.107
- Leaded or unleaded?
- Leaded.

26:15.575 --> 26:17.618
Hey!

26:21.998 --> 26:23.541
Hank.Hank!

26:28.004 --> 26:29.505
Come on, darlin'!

26:29.714 --> 26:31.466
Hey, fella, do me a favor
and get her down off there.

26:31.674 --> 26:33.301
What d'you say?

26:33.509 --> 26:35.178
I say let her dance.

26:35.386 --> 26:36.387
Whoo!

26:38.431 --> 26:39.515
Whoo!

26:40.850 --> 26:42.310
Whoo-hoo!

26:42.852 --> 26:44.562
<i>Come on, ham!'-
[ Whoops 1</i>

26:44.771 --> 26:46.439
hey, look, pal,
we don't want any-

26:48.357 --> 26:49.817
- come on, motherfucker.
- Stay back!

26:50.026 --> 26:51.903
Come on, motherfucker.

27:00.203 --> 27:02.413
Escort this
gentleman to the door.

27:04.791 --> 27:06.167
- Did you see that shit?
- Yeah.

27:06.375 --> 27:08.461
- That's Dalton.
- He sure is cool.

27:16.844 --> 27:18.971
Who is that guy?

27:20.807 --> 27:22.225
He is good.

27:22.433 --> 27:24.227
He's real good.

27:25.853 --> 27:27.855
The name is Dalton.

27:34.987 --> 27:36.405
Oh, yeah!

27:36.614 --> 27:39.200
You're gonna be my regular
Saturday-night thing, baby.

27:39.408 --> 27:42.036
Oh, yeah.
I've been thinkin' about you.

27:42.245 --> 27:43.454
Steve!

27:45.665 --> 27:47.625
- Steve.
- Yo, Steve.

27:50.878 --> 27:52.171
You're history.

27:53.047 --> 27:54.841
But I'm on my break.

27:55.758 --> 27:57.135
Stay on it.

27:58.678 --> 27:59.887
Shit!

28:03.391 --> 28:05.852
You got quite a little
enterprise going here.

28:07.270 --> 28:08.354
What?

28:09.397 --> 28:10.982
You're going through a
bottle every 30 minutes,

28:11.190 --> 28:13.359
you're skimming the till
for six shots a bottle.

28:13.568 --> 28:15.486
On drafts, one every ten.

28:17.905 --> 28:21.534
I figure he's costing
you about 150 a night.

28:23.119 --> 28:24.245
Sq?

28:25.329 --> 28:28.666
So consider it severance pay.
Take the train.

28:31.377 --> 28:33.254
I didn't hear you say that.

28:34.589 --> 28:36.924
Well, I'm sayin' it now.

28:37.133 --> 28:38.467
You sure?

28:40.386 --> 28:41.721
Get out.

28:53.232 --> 28:56.402
Well, it was a good night.
Nobody died.

28:58.779 --> 29:00.865
It'll get worse
before it gets better.

30:21.237 --> 30:24.865
- I love this guy. Isn't he cute?
- Darling.

30:33.291 --> 30:34.750
Dalton!

30:37.378 --> 30:38.671
Hey, Dalton.

30:40.923 --> 30:42.300
Oh no.

30:44.510 --> 30:45.678
Dalton!

30:53.686 --> 30:56.856
Morning, I brought you
some breakfast.

30:58.566 --> 30:59.775
Oh, shit.

31:13.164 --> 31:14.874
So, how'd you find me?

31:15.750 --> 31:20.254
Oh, I... it wasn't too hard.
I mean, you know what I... mean.

31:24.050 --> 31:26.761
What did you do
there last night?

31:28.220 --> 31:29.847
What do you mean?

31:30.056 --> 31:33.017
Well, you fired
the bartender, pat.

31:33.225 --> 31:34.727
He was skimming.

31:35.770 --> 31:37.897
You should not have
done that, Dalton.

31:39.857 --> 31:42.026
Yeah? Why's that?

31:42.234 --> 31:44.945
Just shouldn't
have, that's all.

31:46.781 --> 31:48.157
Here you go.

31:49.241 --> 31:50.368
Breakfast.

31:51.869 --> 31:53.162
Oh, thank you.

31:55.414 --> 31:57.208
Oh, my god!

31:59.085 --> 32:00.586
What is the joke?

32:00.795 --> 32:02.671
Well, there's no joke.

32:02.880 --> 32:05.174
I just think I'm lookin'
at a dead man, though.

32:06.842 --> 32:09.637
It seems everywhere i
go I hear that same joke.

32:09.845 --> 32:12.973
Yeah? Well, something tells
me you bring it on yourself.

32:19.605 --> 32:21.649
"Oh,

than that old beater's worth.

33:21.876 --> 33:25.087
Well, I like her, so
order me one, would you?

33:25.296 --> 33:26.797
It'll take a few clays.

- Aerial, I can get you now.
- Great.

the double deuce?

Yes, sir.

33:37.141 --> 33:38.100

33:38.309 --> 33:40.936
Well, I kinda
figured you'd be by.

standing order now?

33:44.106 --> 33:48.402
- No, I'll pay as I go. Dalton.
- Red Webster.

33:48.611 --> 33:51.864
- How long you gonna be in town?
- Not very long.

33:52.072 --> 33:53.991
That's what i
said 25 years ago.

33:54.200 --> 33:55.743
Really?
What happened?

33:55.951 --> 33:58.078
I got married,
to an ugly woman.

33:58.287 --> 33:59.246
Don't ever do that.

33:59.455 --> 34:01.499
It just takes the
energy right out of you.

34:02.166 --> 34:04.126
She left me, though.

34:04.335 --> 34:07.087
Found somebody even
uglier than she was.

- Red.

34:38.827 --> 34:40.454
Hope you're gonna
clean that place up.

can do for you...

34:46.918 --> 34:48.337
Thanks, red.

34:57.680 --> 34:58.639
Well, red.

Beautiful day, isn't it?

35:02.560 --> 35:03.894
Was.

36:51.877 --> 36:54.505
- Problem?
- There's no problem.

36:54.713 --> 36:56.757
Just a little
mistake, that's all.

36:56.965 --> 36:58.342
What's that?

36:59.176 --> 37:00.427
My job.

37:02.096 --> 37:04.473
You don't get it, do you?

37:04.682 --> 37:06.767
Why don't you
explain it to me?

37:06.975 --> 37:09.937
- I'll explain it to you!
- Hey, shut up, shithead.

37:10.145 --> 37:13.065
Mr. tilghman has
changed his mind.

37:13.273 --> 37:15.818
And that's all you
need to know, son.

37:16.026 --> 37:18.737
No, I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to know a little bit more than that.

37:18.946 --> 37:20.447
Mr. tilghman may own this bar,

37:20.656 --> 37:25.119
but the liquor he serves is
supplied to him by Brad Wesley.

37:25.327 --> 37:27.579
Now, pat mcgurn is in
the employ of Mr. Wesley,

and you're goin'!

What are you afraid of?
Me?

37:49.393 --> 37:51.937
Is that it, Dalton?
You scared to fight me?

37:52.146 --> 37:53.689
You big, bad Dalton.

How'd this happen?

39:24.071 --> 39:25.781
Natural causes.

39:25.989 --> 39:28.242
Looks like a knife wound.

39:28.450 --> 39:29.493
Like I said.

You're a bouncer.

Mm-hmm. Double deuce.

39:37.459 --> 39:38.460
Nice place.

39:38.669 --> 39:41.171
They send a lot of
business my way.

39:41.380 --> 39:43.507
I'm hoping to change that.

39:43.715 --> 39:45.092
All by yourself?

39:49.471 --> 39:50.806
Well, Mr. Dalton,

39:51.014 --> 39:54.977
you may add nine staples to
your dossier of 31 broken bones,

39:55.185 --> 39:57.104
two bullet wounds,
nine puncture wounds,

39:57.312 --> 39:58.647
and four stainless steel screws.

39:58.856 --> 40:00.774
That's an estimate, of course.

40:00.983 --> 40:01.775
I'll give you a local.

40:01.984 --> 40:03.151
No, thank you.

40:04.278 --> 40:06.029
Do you enjoy pain?

40:06.238 --> 40:07.614
Pain don't hurt.

40:08.824 --> 40:11.785
Most of my patients
would disagree with you.

40:11.994 --> 40:12.911
Okay-

40:18.625 --> 40:21.837
d'you always carry your
medical records around with you?

40:24.590 --> 40:25.674
Saves time.

Any particular discipline?

No, not really.

That sort of shit.

Come up with any answers?

40:46.737 --> 40:48.906
Not too many.

you end up a bouncer?

the double deuce sometime,

of coffee if you...

neighborhood, huh?

that line of work,

41:50.467 --> 41:52.511

41:53.971 --> 41:56.223
Gee, I've never
heard that before.

42:48.233 --> 42:50.444

Is that it?

42:51.486 --> 42:52.821
No, boss, you didn't.

have me, who's he got?

And if I'm not
there, you're there.

43:06.626 --> 43:09.379

Well, one of you boys
owes me an apology.

to you to decide

43:13.800 --> 43:17.137
which one of you wants
to say "I'm sorry."

43:19.097 --> 43:20.182
I'm sorry, boss.

43:20.390 --> 43:21.600
I'm sorry, boss.

43:21.808 --> 43:23.685
I believe you, tinker.

43:25.103 --> 43:27.939
But you, o'Connor, somehow
i don't believe you.

43:28.148 --> 43:29.483
Now you'd better try it again.

43:29.691 --> 43:30.984
Because if there's one
thing I can't stand,

43:31.193 --> 43:32.360
it's a man who's untruthful.

43:32.569 --> 43:33.612
I'm sorry, boss.

43:33.820 --> 43:34.863
And if there's one
thing that disgusts me

43:35.072 --> 43:36.114
is a man who can't
admit he's wrong.

43:36.323 --> 43:37.491
I swear to god,
boss, I'm sorry.

43:37.699 --> 43:38.700
You disgust me, o'Connor.

43:38.909 --> 43:39.743
You wanna know why
you disgust me?

43:39.951 --> 43:41.036
No, why, boss?

43:44.790 --> 43:46.374
Cause you're a bleeder.

43:46.583 --> 43:48.668
You bleed too much.

43:48.877 --> 43:50.253
You are a messy bleeder.

43:53.006 --> 43:54.341
You're weak.

43:54.549 --> 43:56.301
You got no endurance for pain.

43:59.554 --> 44:00.972
Now, come on.

44:01.181 --> 44:02.015
Get up.

44:02.224 --> 44:03.642
Hey, you'll be fine. Come on.

44:06.269 --> 44:07.771
Well, help him up!

44:12.651 --> 44:14.694
You're gonna be fine.

44:14.903 --> 44:16.530
And you know why?

44:16.738 --> 44:18.156
Because I like you.

44:23.078 --> 44:24.955
Get this piece-of-shit
coward out of here.

44:34.005 --> 44:36.174
Work ain't work when
you're havin' fun.

44:36.383 --> 44:37.467
Life is good.

44:59.906 --> 45:00.615
Jesus.

45:04.286 --> 45:05.078
Red?

45:06.788 --> 45:07.497
Red!

45:07.706 --> 45:08.415
Yeah?

45:09.666 --> 45:10.375
What happened?

45:10.584 --> 45:11.668
Did you get robbed?

45:11.877 --> 45:12.794
Every week.

45:23.930 --> 45:26.141
So what does he take?

45:26.349 --> 45:26.975
Who?

45:27.184 --> 45:28.226
Brad Wesley.

45:32.689 --> 45:34.399
10%, to start.

45:35.525 --> 45:37.277
Oh, it's all legal like.

45:37.485 --> 45:40.530
He formed the Jasper
improvement society.

45:40.739 --> 45:43.992
All the businesses
in town belong to it.

45:44.910 --> 45:46.203
Everybody pay?

45:48.955 --> 45:51.625
Does a hobbyhorse
have a wooden dick?

45:53.919 --> 45:55.128
Squirt em!

45:55.337 --> 45:56.254
Squirt em!

45:56.463 --> 45:57.172
Woohoo!

45:58.089 --> 45:59.174
Do it again.

46:08.475 --> 46:10.977
Charge!

46:11.186 --> 46:12.520
Come back here.

46:13.647 --> 46:15.065
Take it easy, Rambo.

46:15.273 --> 46:16.942
I know you wanna save the
world from the commies,

46:17.150 --> 46:20.904
but you're gonna have to
do it from down here, man.

46:21.112 --> 46:22.572
Squirt him, squirt him.

46:22.781 --> 46:23.490
Hose him down.

46:23.698 --> 46:25.867
Cool him off, cool him off.

46:27.202 --> 46:28.370
Garrett!

46:28.578 --> 46:29.329
Yo!

46:29.537 --> 46:31.539
Some guy name of Dalton.

46:34.584 --> 46:36.086
What's going on, miho?

46:36.294 --> 46:37.003
Hey, hey.

46:37.212 --> 46:38.630
How you doin', buddy?

46:38.838 --> 46:39.547
Oh shit!

46:39.756 --> 46:41.049
Hell, kid, I'm in hog heaven.

46:41.258 --> 46:43.343
If I was doin' any better i
couldn't live with myself.

46:43.551 --> 46:44.970
How bout you?

46:45.178 --> 46:46.137
I'm all right.

46:46.346 --> 46:47.389
Good, by god, you oughta be,

46:47.597 --> 46:49.766
all that money
you're making, right?

46:49.975 --> 46:52.018
What's going on down in Jasper?

46:52.227 --> 46:53.270
Oh, you know.

46:53.478 --> 46:55.063
New town, same story.

46:58.149 --> 46:58.900
Listen.

47:00.360 --> 47:02.821
You ever heard of a
guy named Brad Wesley?

47:03.029 --> 47:04.698
No, I can't say that I have.

47:04.906 --> 47:06.408
You having trouble?

47:07.284 --> 47:07.993
Oh, you know.

47:08.201 --> 47:09.869
Nothing I'm not used to.

47:10.078 --> 47:12.664
But it's amazing what
you can get used to, huh?

47:12.872 --> 47:14.582
Yeah, tell me about it.

47:14.791 --> 47:17.043
This place has a sign hanging
over the urinal that says,

47:17.252 --> 47:19.754
"don't eat the big, white mint."

47:23.925 --> 47:25.593
Stay cool, kid.

47:25.802 --> 47:26.553
Right.

47:26.761 --> 47:27.470
Gotta go.

47:27.679 --> 47:28.888
I'll see ya.

47:29.097 --> 47:29.806
Later.

48:04.132 --> 48:06.468
Why won't you look
me in the eye, Dalton?

48:06.676 --> 48:08.094
I'm shy.

48:08.303 --> 48:10.013
Would you be
shocked if I said,

48:10.221 --> 48:12.766
"let's go to my place and fuck?"

48:15.769 --> 48:17.562
Ain't gonna kill you.

48:18.772 --> 48:21.566
You know, you
might even like it.

48:22.901 --> 48:24.986
Say good night, Denise.

48:35.914 --> 48:36.623
Bastard!

48:36.831 --> 48:37.457
Let go!

49:03.608 --> 49:04.776
I didn't know she could sing.

49:12.409 --> 49:13.410
Right boot.

49:17.247 --> 49:18.039
Got it.

49:23.586 --> 49:25.380
Sorry, we're closed.

49:25.588 --> 49:28.216
Well, then what are all
these people doin' here?

49:28.425 --> 49:30.552
Drinking and
having a good time.

49:31.719 --> 49:33.680
Well, that's why we're here.

49:34.889 --> 49:38.101
You're too stupid
to have a good time.

49:47.735 --> 49:51.865
[Yelling 1

50:00.081 --> 50:00.874
go on, Dalton.

50:01.040 --> 50:02.000
Kick his ass!

50:19.225 --> 50:21.227
All right! Yeah!

50:26.399 --> 50:27.775
Son of a bitch!

50:29.569 --> 50:30.945
Give me the biggest
guy in the world,

50:31.154 --> 50:33.740
you smash his knee,
he'll drop like a stone.

50:41.206 --> 50:42.248
Damn good fight.

50:46.753 --> 50:47.879
Hi.
Hi.

50:49.797 --> 50:51.174
So, you looking for somebody?

50:51.382 --> 50:52.091
You.

51:16.741 --> 51:19.869
Are you always
better than they are?

51:20.828 --> 51:22.121
Pretty much.

51:22.330 --> 51:24.415
Never been put down?

51:24.624 --> 51:27.752
No, not really.

51:28.419 --> 51:30.547
How do you explain that?

51:32.757 --> 51:34.175
The ones who go
looking for trouble

51:34.384 --> 51:37.428
are not much of a problem to
someone who's ready for them.

51:37.637 --> 51:40.515
I suspect it's
always been that way.

51:46.271 --> 51:48.356
Somebody has to do it.

51:48.565 --> 51:50.650
Somebody's gotta
pay somebody to do it.

51:52.902 --> 51:54.737
Might as well be you.

51:58.908 --> 52:00.326
I'd better take you home.

52:01.619 --> 52:02.620
If I keep talking,

52:02.829 --> 52:04.789
you're gonna go off
thinking I'm a nice guy.

52:05.915 --> 52:08.376
I know you're not a nice guy.

52:10.628 --> 52:11.671
Pretty soon I'm
gonna have to start

52:11.879 --> 52:13.339
charging that bum rent.

52:17.927 --> 52:19.304
Tonight's rent.

52:42.702 --> 52:43.786
Your fan club?

52:43.995 --> 52:45.455
They are devoted.

52:53.463 --> 52:56.507
You live some kind
of life, Dalton.

52:58.217 --> 52:59.761
Too ugly for you.

53:01.679 --> 53:03.264
I didn't say that.

53:27.038 --> 53:27.789
See ya.

53:27.997 --> 53:28.665
Bye.

54:07.704 --> 54:10.832
We've been looking
all over for you.

54:15.628 --> 54:18.339
Mr. Wesley wants to see you.

54:18.548 --> 54:19.257
Let's go.

54:27.724 --> 54:28.683
After you.

55:01.799 --> 55:03.468
Hey, Dalton.

55:03.676 --> 55:05.094
Have a bloody Mary?

55:06.220 --> 55:07.221
Some breakfast?

55:07.430 --> 55:08.681
No, thank you.

55:08.890 --> 55:10.057
Suit yourself.

55:12.143 --> 55:14.520
Will you shut that shit off?

55:18.733 --> 55:19.650
I can't listen to that crap.

55:19.859 --> 55:21.235
It's got no heart.

55:29.660 --> 55:31.370
My grandfather.

55:31.579 --> 55:33.206
Looks like an important man.

55:34.040 --> 55:35.583
He was an asshole.

55:37.752 --> 55:42.089
But you, you're a smart
boy, aren't you, Dalton?

55:42.298 --> 55:45.009
You're just not too realistic.

55:45.218 --> 55:46.677
Christ, I'm just like you.

55:46.886 --> 55:50.807
I came up the hard way,
from the streets of Chicago.

55:51.015 --> 55:52.058
You know, when i
came to this town

55:52.266 --> 55:54.060
after Korea there was nothing.

55:54.310 --> 55:55.895
I brought the mall here.

55:56.103 --> 55:57.438
I got the 7-Eleven.

55:57.647 --> 55:59.273
I got the photomat here.

55:59.482 --> 56:02.109
Christ, j.C. Penney is
coming here because of me.

56:02.318 --> 56:05.029
You ask anybody,
they'll tell you.

56:06.948 --> 56:09.158
You've gotten rich off
of the people in this town.

56:11.285 --> 56:12.912
You bet your ass I have.

56:13.120 --> 56:15.122
And I'm gonna get richer.

56:17.458 --> 56:20.753
I believe we all have a
purpose on this earth.

56:20.962 --> 56:21.629
A destiny.

56:22.880 --> 56:24.382
I have a faith in that destiny.

56:24.590 --> 56:28.761
It tells me to gather
unto me what is mine.

56:29.554 --> 56:32.473
But, Christ, you get paid
for beating people up.

56:32.682 --> 56:33.975
Tell me you don't love it.

56:34.183 --> 56:35.268
Of course you do.

56:35.476 --> 56:37.270
You wouldn't be
human if you didn't.

56:43.234 --> 56:44.026
Dalton.

56:46.028 --> 56:47.822
I have a cousin in Memphis.

56:48.447 --> 56:50.408
Tells me you killed
a man down there.

56:51.409 --> 56:53.828
Tells me you said it was
self-defense at the trial.

56:54.662 --> 56:57.206
But you and I know that
isn't so, don't we?

56:59.917 --> 57:01.043
Relax.

57:01.210 --> 57:02.503
Relax.

57:07.049 --> 57:08.426
Tell me,

57:08.634 --> 57:12.680
if I owned a bar and
wanted to clean it up,

57:12.889 --> 57:15.641
how much would it take to
get you to come work for me?

57:24.525 --> 57:26.861
There's no amount of money.

57:51.093 --> 57:53.512
All right, we're here!

58:42.853 --> 58:43.646
Thanks.

58:56.117 --> 58:57.451
Good to see you.

58:57.660 --> 58:58.369
Hi.

59:04.166 --> 59:06.168
Ernie, what's the story?

59:06.377 --> 59:08.170
Whiskey's running low.

59:10.464 --> 59:12.550
I finally get this place
just the way I want it,

59:12.758 --> 59:14.635
and now we're
running out of booze.

59:15.553 --> 59:17.513
I've called every
supplier I know.

59:19.098 --> 59:20.683
Why won't they deliver?

59:22.059 --> 59:23.060
Wesley.

59:23.269 --> 59:25.187
Ernie, give me the phone.

59:27.732 --> 59:29.525
I'll take care of it.

59:41.412 --> 59:42.204
Hi.

59:47.918 --> 59:50.463
Hear you're the new
marshal in town.

59:50.671 --> 59:51.630
You heard wrong.

59:51.839 --> 59:52.506
Uh-oh.

59:55.217 --> 59:58.345
Dig a hole.

01:00:09.482 --> 01:00:10.858
This is your place?

01:00:11.942 --> 01:00:12.735
Up there.

01:00:14.236 --> 01:00:15.154
Come on.

01:00:32.963 --> 01:00:34.715
It's quiet and the
horses let me know

01:00:34.924 --> 01:00:36.217
if anybody comes around.

01:00:37.468 --> 01:00:38.344
I love it.

01:01:34.358 --> 01:01:36.443
So I saw your picture
in red Webster's place.

01:01:36.652 --> 01:01:37.820
He's my uncle.

01:01:38.988 --> 01:01:40.948
Nice old guy.

01:01:41.157 --> 01:01:42.158
Yeah.

01:01:42.366 --> 01:01:44.076
He raised me after
my parents died.

01:01:44.285 --> 01:01:46.120
That's why I came back here.

01:01:46.328 --> 01:01:47.955
Now we take care of each other.

01:01:50.291 --> 01:01:52.793
So how come you
never got married?

01:01:53.002 --> 01:01:53.711
I did.

01:01:55.296 --> 01:01:56.130
What happened?

01:01:56.297 --> 01:01:57.506
It didn't work.

01:01:58.424 --> 01:01:59.133
Why?

01:02:00.217 --> 01:02:02.178
Guess I picked the wrong guy.

01:04:58.062 --> 01:04:59.188
Little rock.

01:05:00.689 --> 01:05:02.983
You're gonna have a lot of
pain when you get older, Dalton.

01:05:03.192 --> 01:05:06.236
You could be crippled
if you don't slow down.

01:05:06.445 --> 01:05:08.447
Yeah, that's what they say.

01:05:08.655 --> 01:05:10.115
You already know that?

01:05:10.282 --> 01:05:13.410
No, I just said,
"that's what they say."

01:05:20.042 --> 01:05:22.878
Where are you
gonna go from here?

01:05:27.091 --> 01:05:28.300
I don't know.

01:05:29.802 --> 01:05:31.637
You could stay, Dalton.

01:05:31.845 --> 01:05:33.138
If you wanted to.

01:05:38.602 --> 01:05:40.187
I don't think so.

01:06:27.401 --> 01:06:28.193
Hang on.

01:06:35.534 --> 01:06:37.411
You got a woman
up there with you?

01:06:37.619 --> 01:06:38.537
That's right.

01:06:38.704 --> 01:06:40.497
Don't give me no lip, lord.

01:06:40.706 --> 01:06:41.957
Where did she get to?

01:06:42.166 --> 01:06:43.208
She'll be back.

01:06:43.417 --> 01:06:45.210
If you're smart,
you'd pitch your tent.

01:06:45.419 --> 01:06:49.006
Sometimes I'm just not
as smart as I'd like to be.

01:06:49.214 --> 01:06:50.215
You never know, son.

01:06:50.424 --> 01:06:54.094
Maybe she'll be smart
enough for both of you.

01:06:56.138 --> 01:06:57.431
Thanks, Ernie.

01:06:59.808 --> 01:07:00.559
Hiya, dal.

01:07:00.767 --> 01:07:01.393
Hi, honey.

01:07:01.602 --> 01:07:02.227
Hey, there he is.

01:07:02.436 --> 01:07:03.687
Hey, what's up.

01:07:08.025 --> 01:07:09.276
Hey, Cody-

01:07:09.485 --> 01:07:10.110
hey, bro.

01:07:10.319 --> 01:07:11.236
What's going down?

01:07:11.445 --> 01:07:13.280
Not too much.

01:07:13.489 --> 01:07:15.866
That's not what I hear.

01:07:16.074 --> 01:07:17.534
The word is that you've been

01:07:17.743 --> 01:07:20.454
spending time with
Elizabeth Clay.

01:07:21.371 --> 01:07:22.414
Sq?

01:07:22.623 --> 01:07:25.709
Know who had a thing
for Elizabeth Clay?

01:07:25.918 --> 01:07:26.877
Brad Wesley.

01:07:29.004 --> 01:07:33.133
Now, as I hear it, she
left town and he went nuts.

01:07:36.386 --> 01:07:38.639
It's a small town, Dalton.

01:07:38.847 --> 01:07:39.556
Dalton!

01:07:40.933 --> 01:07:42.392
The truck's here.

01:07:44.061 --> 01:07:44.811
Okay-

01:07:46.188 --> 01:07:48.690
of course, that's
just the word.

01:07:48.899 --> 01:07:50.025
Thanks.

01:07:50.234 --> 01:07:51.193
No problem.

01:08:15.259 --> 01:08:16.801
The double deuce.

01:08:32.109 --> 01:08:32.984
Hey, hey!

01:08:35.069 --> 01:08:36.238
Put 'em back.

01:08:36.446 --> 01:08:39.241
This bar is closed for business.

01:08:39.448 --> 01:08:40.075
It's okay, Jim.

01:08:40.283 --> 01:08:41.243
Take a break.

01:08:50.252 --> 01:08:52.421
Can I buy you guys a drink?

01:08:54.089 --> 01:08:54.881
Guess not.

01:09:13.483 --> 01:09:17.613
You got a skinny little runt
named Dalton working here?

01:09:18.779 --> 01:09:20.782
Yeah, he's out the back.

01:09:20.991 --> 01:09:21.950
I know you.

01:09:24.036 --> 01:09:24.870
Pour me a beer, will you?

01:09:25.078 --> 01:09:25.996
I'll be back.

01:09:28.624 --> 01:09:31.251
How d'you like that, kung fu?

01:09:32.669 --> 01:09:34.504
How's it going, miho?

01:09:35.881 --> 01:09:38.341
Mind your own business, dad.

01:09:43.721 --> 01:09:46.058
Do you wanna fight, dickless?

01:09:46.265 --> 01:09:49.227
I sure ain't gonna
show you my dick.

01:09:52.397 --> 01:09:53.273
Oh, shit!

01:09:54.566 --> 01:09:56.318
Goddamn, that
hurts, doesn't it?

01:10:11.667 --> 01:10:13.418
Hey, there's a fight out back!

01:10:26.223 --> 01:10:27.933
Hey, I had it under control.

01:10:28.141 --> 01:10:29.643
Yeah, I knew that.

01:10:30.811 --> 01:10:31.812
Glad to see you.

01:10:32.020 --> 01:10:32.771
Good to see you.

01:10:32.979 --> 01:10:35.065
Who is that guy?

01:10:35.273 --> 01:10:37.317
Gentlemen, Wade Garrett.

01:10:38.485 --> 01:10:39.444
Holy shit.

01:10:40.362 --> 01:10:41.655
Exactly right.

01:10:43.907 --> 01:10:45.992
Morgan, nice to see ya.

01:10:50.330 --> 01:10:52.833
Where in the fuck
are we going now?

01:10:53.041 --> 01:10:56.420
I got somebody i
want you to meet.

01:10:56.628 --> 01:10:57.337
Uh-oh.

01:11:09.015 --> 01:11:10.517
I thought you said
you were all right.

01:11:10.726 --> 01:11:11.518
I'm fine.

01:11:16.523 --> 01:11:17.858
I fucking knew it.

01:11:20.068 --> 01:11:21.278
Hi.

01:11:21.486 --> 01:11:22.195
<i>Hey '</i>

01:11:27.492 --> 01:11:30.412
1975, Albuquerque.

01:11:31.329 --> 01:11:34.666
Got blindsided by a
bottle of Jack Daniel's.

01:11:34.875 --> 01:11:37.878
Fucking around somewhere i
shouldn't have been at the time.

01:11:38.086 --> 01:11:39.379
I was very drunk.

01:11:40.505 --> 01:11:42.257
Kid here got his head cracked.

01:11:43.508 --> 01:11:45.010
You got the scar.

01:11:45.844 --> 01:11:47.679
Oh, I'll show you a scar.

01:11:47.888 --> 01:11:51.057
I'll show you one I'm real
sentimental about, doc.

01:11:57.063 --> 01:11:58.482
A woman?

01:11:58.690 --> 01:11:59.775
Boy, was she!

01:12:01.026 --> 01:12:02.110
God, I feel like dancing.

01:12:02.319 --> 01:12:04.029
Would you like to dance, doc?

01:12:04.237 --> 01:12:04.946
Yeah.

01:12:05.155 --> 01:12:06.782
What time is it?

01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:07.616
Daytime.

01:12:07.824 --> 01:12:08.825
Well, good.

01:12:09.034 --> 01:12:09.868
Then some other place
has gotta be open.

01:12:10.076 --> 01:12:11.369
Let's get out of here.

01:12:11.578 --> 01:12:14.748
Take this lady someplace where
it's a little more romantic.

01:12:14.956 --> 01:12:15.582
Let's go.

01:12:15.791 --> 01:12:16.750
He's serious.

01:12:16.958 --> 01:12:17.584
Come on.

01:12:17.793 --> 01:12:19.586
Well, we'd better go.

01:12:23.507 --> 01:12:24.216
There you are.

01:12:24.424 --> 01:12:26.426
I hope y'all enjoy it.

01:12:37.813 --> 01:12:41.066
"Ex's live in Texas."

01:12:41.274 --> 01:12:41.983
<i>'Lee-ha.</i>

01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:48.448
God, he's great coming
out of the gate,

01:12:48.657 --> 01:12:50.659
but not much for stamina.

01:13:03.296 --> 01:13:04.923
This the part where you
tell me what a great guy

01:13:05.090 --> 01:13:05.924
your friend is?

01:13:06.132 --> 01:13:06.800
Hardly.

01:13:09.052 --> 01:13:11.513
This is the part where I tell
you I want you for myself.

01:13:13.932 --> 01:13:15.183
Uh, yo!

01:13:15.392 --> 01:13:19.312
Whatever he's saying, you can
be fairly sure it's a lie.

01:13:28.572 --> 01:13:29.990
Don't bet on it.

01:13:31.575 --> 01:13:32.492
Thanks, doc.

01:13:34.578 --> 01:13:36.496
Excuse me, gentlemen.

01:13:43.503 --> 01:13:45.839
That gal's got
entirely too many brains

01:13:46.047 --> 01:13:47.966
to have an ass like that.

01:13:50.385 --> 01:13:52.721
You got your hands full, kid.

01:13:56.349 --> 01:13:57.809
What's the matter?

01:14:01.897 --> 01:14:04.941
Still living in the
past, aren't you?

01:14:05.901 --> 01:14:08.361
We're a long way from Memphis.

01:14:10.363 --> 01:14:12.157
Memphis has nothing
to do with it.

01:14:12.365 --> 01:14:13.575
Bullshit!

01:14:13.783 --> 01:14:15.327
That dog won't hunt.

01:14:16.536 --> 01:14:17.662
I can't believe you're still

01:14:17.871 --> 01:14:20.332
dragging that shit
around with you.

01:14:21.541 --> 01:14:24.544
It seems to me you'd
be a little more

01:14:24.753 --> 01:14:26.504
philosophical about it.

01:14:28.089 --> 01:14:30.216
And cut it the fuck loose.

01:14:32.761 --> 01:14:34.971
You know that fucking cu...

01:14:36.139 --> 01:14:37.057
That girl...

01:14:38.475 --> 01:14:40.977
Never told you she was married.

01:14:42.187 --> 01:14:42.979
Did she?

01:14:46.024 --> 01:14:48.568
And when a man sticks
a gun in your face

01:14:48.777 --> 01:14:50.987
you got two choices.

01:14:51.196 --> 01:14:54.115
You can die or you can
kill the motherfucker.

01:15:02.582 --> 01:15:04.709
Don't mean to bust up
the party or anything,

01:15:04.918 --> 01:15:06.795
but my shift starts
in a couple of hours.

01:15:07.003 --> 01:15:08.046
Oh, yeah.

01:15:08.213 --> 01:15:10.006
Thought I'd go home
and get a little sleep.

01:15:11.466 --> 01:15:13.051
Aren't you guys tired?

01:15:13.259 --> 01:15:16.721
I'll get all the
sleep I need when I'm dead.

01:15:16.930 --> 01:15:18.556
Thanks for the dance.

01:15:23.895 --> 01:15:24.688
Bye.

01:16:19.576 --> 01:16:22.287
Dalton, red's
place is on fire!

01:16:43.099 --> 01:16:44.476
Oh, my god.

01:17:15.799 --> 01:17:16.591
Well, with a fire like that,

01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:18.051
nothing they could do.

01:17:18.259 --> 01:17:19.177
Nothing.

01:17:19.385 --> 01:17:20.428
Jack Daniel's.

01:17:31.147 --> 01:17:31.898
Thank you.

01:17:33.942 --> 01:17:35.026
It's like a morgue in here.

01:17:35.235 --> 01:17:36.820
Play something, Elvis.

01:17:37.028 --> 01:17:37.821
Get those firemen in here.

01:17:38.029 --> 01:17:39.906
I wanna buy them a drink.

01:17:40.115 --> 01:17:41.157
They risked their lives to save

01:17:41.366 --> 01:17:44.202
a no-good faggot draft
dodger like red Webster.

01:17:44.369 --> 01:17:46.621
Ask for a little contribution
to improve the town,

01:17:46.830 --> 01:17:49.332
everybody digs deep, except for him.

01:17:51.167 --> 01:17:53.586
Of course you can dance, honey.

01:17:53.795 --> 01:17:56.381
Elvis, play
something with balls.

01:20:16.813 --> 01:20:19.148
If you're gonna have a
pet, keep it on a leash.

01:20:21.025 --> 01:20:22.110
You're right.

01:20:22.318 --> 01:20:23.319
Jimmy!

01:21:42.940 --> 01:21:44.609
Can somebody get
a drink around here?

01:22:07.048 --> 01:22:07.840
You!

01:22:36.619 --> 01:22:37.995
Come on, old man.

01:22:56.097 --> 01:22:57.640
All right, that's enough.

01:23:03.104 --> 01:23:04.730
This isn't working out, Dalton.

01:23:11.404 --> 01:23:12.572
Let's 90, doys-

01:23:16.492 --> 01:23:18.411
your ass is mine, boy.

01:23:26.669 --> 01:23:29.380
Same town, new
story, huh, pal?

01:23:32.425 --> 01:23:33.801
Let's get a beer.

01:23:37.722 --> 01:23:40.308
I've talked till I'm blue
in the face, goddammit.

01:23:40.516 --> 01:23:42.268
We could salvage
the place, red.

01:23:42.477 --> 01:23:43.311
We could build it back up.

01:23:43.519 --> 01:23:44.312
I'll help ya out.

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:45.688
Nope.

01:23:45.897 --> 01:23:47.607
But you got
insurance, don't you?

01:23:47.815 --> 01:23:49.317
Twenty years I've watched
Wesley get richer

01:23:49.525 --> 01:23:51.819
while everybody else
around him got poorer.

01:23:52.028 --> 01:23:53.529
Can you prove he
started the fire?

01:23:54.739 --> 01:23:55.990
Who you gonna prove it to?

01:23:56.616 --> 01:23:57.867
He's got the sheriff

01:23:58.075 --> 01:23:59.994
and the whole police force
in his pocket for chrissakes.

01:24:00.203 --> 01:24:02.580
I can call a friend in Springfield
who works with the FBI.

01:24:04.165 --> 01:24:06.167
Are you gonna take
the stand against him?

01:24:12.298 --> 01:24:15.551
There's only one person around here
you gotta prove anything to.

01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:17.470
That's Wesley himself.

01:24:23.059 --> 01:24:25.478
You scared him last night.

01:24:25.686 --> 01:24:28.439
Brad Wesley, he's not
afraid of anything, right?

01:24:28.648 --> 01:24:32.318
Well, last night that son
of a bitch was afraid.

01:24:33.236 --> 01:24:34.445
No, he wasn't.

01:24:50.753 --> 01:24:51.921
Dalton, you oughta
check this out.

01:24:52.129 --> 01:24:52.922
Looks like Wesley wants to put

01:24:53.130 --> 01:24:54.840
a little something
down on a new car.

01:25:00.137 --> 01:25:02.557
You lost your
faith, stroudenmire.

01:25:02.765 --> 01:25:04.767
That's what it is.

01:25:04.976 --> 01:25:06.852
It's made you an abuser.

01:25:08.563 --> 01:25:10.314
Well, what are you
waiting for, Gary?

01:25:10.523 --> 01:25:12.775
Drive through there!

01:25:14.819 --> 01:25:16.279
No! No! No!

01:25:17.947 --> 01:25:20.157
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

01:25:44.807 --> 01:25:46.183
Oh, my god!

01:25:47.727 --> 01:25:48.728
Oh, my god!

01:26:00.156 --> 01:26:02.658
What the hell is
wrong with you, Brad?

01:26:02.867 --> 01:26:04.744
Have you lost your mind?

01:26:05.661 --> 01:26:06.996
He's a drifter, you know.

01:26:07.204 --> 01:26:10.666
To see you wind up with someone
like that, it's a shame.

01:26:10.875 --> 01:26:12.877
This has nothing
to do with him.

01:26:13.085 --> 01:26:17.214
Well, you get him
out of here, Elizabeth,

01:26:17.423 --> 01:26:19.425
'cause if you don't,

01:26:19.634 --> 01:26:21.552
he's going down.

01:26:21.761 --> 01:26:24.555
And I'm not gonna lose a
second's sleep about it.

01:26:35.358 --> 01:26:36.359
Stroudenmire.

01:26:40.863 --> 01:26:43.324
I never thought you'd
turn on me, too.

01:26:45.201 --> 01:26:46.452
This is my town.

01:26:49.789 --> 01:26:51.415
Don't you forget it.

01:26:52.958 --> 01:26:54.251
Let's go, Jimmy-

01:26:58.047 --> 01:26:59.924
you got insurance, don't you?

01:27:21.946 --> 01:27:23.072
Well, amigo.

01:27:24.573 --> 01:27:26.659
You're all fucked
up, aren't you?

01:27:31.664 --> 01:27:34.250
Let's crank that thing up
and head down the road.

01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:39.046
We can be gone by dawn,
never see this place again.

01:27:39.672 --> 01:27:41.716
You can leave any
time you want to.

01:27:42.550 --> 01:27:43.968
Oh, shit, kid.

01:27:50.391 --> 01:27:51.350
Oh, fuck.

01:28:08.826 --> 01:28:10.119
You don't need this.

01:28:10.327 --> 01:28:11.746
Don't tell me what I need!

01:28:11.954 --> 01:28:12.913
If you want to go, go.

01:28:13.122 --> 01:28:15.124
Get the fuck out of
here and leave me alone.

01:28:17.334 --> 01:28:18.544
Yeah, you're right.

01:28:19.545 --> 01:28:21.714
I ought to stop
telling you what to do.

01:28:22.882 --> 01:28:25.050
Maybe I ought to kick your ass.

01:28:28.804 --> 01:28:30.723
No, we don't wanna do this.

01:28:33.893 --> 01:28:35.603
I wanna tell you something else.

01:28:38.272 --> 01:28:41.108
You taught me as much
as I ever taught you.

01:28:47.823 --> 01:28:49.200
I love you, miho.

01:28:52.495 --> 01:28:53.496
I'll see you.

01:29:26.570 --> 01:29:27.363
Dalton?

01:29:30.157 --> 01:29:31.951
It's a little late for a
house call, don't you think?

01:29:32.159 --> 01:29:33.744
I came to talk to you.

01:29:33.953 --> 01:29:34.662
No.

01:29:35.621 --> 01:29:37.164
You came to tell me to leave.

01:29:38.165 --> 01:29:40.042
I care about you, Dalton.

01:29:40.251 --> 01:29:41.669
You don't know him.

01:29:41.877 --> 01:29:42.628
Bullshit!

01:29:45.548 --> 01:29:47.716
I know exactly who
Brad Wesley is.

01:29:47.925 --> 01:29:50.511
I have seen his kind many times.

01:29:50.719 --> 01:29:54.807
He keeps taking and taking
until somebody takes him.

01:29:55.015 --> 01:29:57.601
It's obvious nobody in this
town can stand up to him.

01:29:57.810 --> 01:29:58.936
But you can stop him?

01:29:59.144 --> 01:30:01.105
Brad Wesley picked me.

01:30:01.313 --> 01:30:03.566
And when he did he fucked up.

01:30:04.817 --> 01:30:06.694
I am only good at
one thing, doc.

01:30:06.902 --> 01:30:08.153
I never lose.

01:30:08.362 --> 01:30:09.738
But what are you gonna win?

01:30:09.947 --> 01:30:10.698
Who's this for anyway?

01:30:10.906 --> 01:30:12.074
Are you doing it for them?

01:30:13.784 --> 01:30:15.077
I don't think so.

01:30:18.289 --> 01:30:21.166
You think you're gonna save
these people from Brad Wesley?

01:30:21.375 --> 01:30:22.918
Well, who's gonna
save 'em from you?

01:30:35.097 --> 01:30:36.056
Emmet!

01:30:42.771 --> 01:30:43.564
Emmet?

01:31:20.434 --> 01:31:22.144
Emmet, talk to me.

01:31:22.353 --> 01:31:23.270
Are you all right?

01:31:24.063 --> 01:31:26.690
I'd be fine if
you'd get off of me.

01:31:59.473 --> 01:32:00.808
Prepare to die.

01:32:01.475 --> 01:32:03.519
You are such an asshole.

01:33:24.641 --> 01:33:27.561
I used to fuck guys
like you in prison.

01:33:43.410 --> 01:33:44.953
Damn, boy.

01:33:45.162 --> 01:33:46.872
I thought you were good.

01:33:47.081 --> 01:33:48.540
Go fuck yourself.

01:34:18.112 --> 01:34:20.572
I'm gonna kill you
the old-fashioned way.

01:35:03.323 --> 01:35:04.658
Wesley!

01:35:09.037 --> 01:35:10.706
Wesley!

01:35:13.625 --> 01:35:15.627
Wesley!

01:35:18.505 --> 01:35:20.382
Fuck you!

01:36:07.471 --> 01:36:08.305
Hello.

01:36:08.513 --> 01:36:09.890
Top of the morning to you.

01:36:10.390 --> 01:36:12.309
Well, here's what's
on for today.

01:36:13.018 --> 01:36:14.311
Wade...

01:36:14.519 --> 01:36:15.479
Or Elizabeth?

01:36:16.730 --> 01:36:17.522
What?

01:36:18.607 --> 01:36:20.025
One of 'em dies.

01:36:21.777 --> 01:36:23.362
Now, who will it be?

01:36:28.617 --> 01:36:30.285
You are a sick man.

01:36:31.453 --> 01:36:34.081
Well, I just have
to flip a coin.

01:36:34.289 --> 01:36:35.582
Hold on a second.

01:36:37.376 --> 01:36:38.168
Wesley!

01:36:47.052 --> 01:36:47.844
Dalton,

01:36:49.054 --> 01:36:51.431
I'd sure like to tell
you how it turned out.

01:36:55.477 --> 01:36:56.895
Wesley!

01:37:11.535 --> 01:37:12.244
Garrett.

01:37:12.452 --> 01:37:13.745
Oh, my god.

01:37:15.497 --> 01:37:16.206
Over here.

01:37:21.003 --> 01:37:21.712
Are you all right?

01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:22.587
Mmm-hm.

01:37:23.547 --> 01:37:25.841
There was only three of 'em.

01:37:27.884 --> 01:37:29.678
They said I was lucky.

01:37:33.265 --> 01:37:34.808
I gotta find doc.

01:37:36.268 --> 01:37:37.102
Let's go.

01:37:38.186 --> 01:37:39.771
Sit the fuck down.

01:37:39.980 --> 01:37:40.564
Have a beer.

01:37:40.772 --> 01:37:41.398
I'll be back.

01:37:41.606 --> 01:37:42.274
<i>Hey '</i>

01:37:46.194 --> 01:37:47.904
Wesley wins, man.

01:37:48.113 --> 01:37:49.364
We're out of here.

01:37:50.282 --> 01:37:51.491
Attaboy, miho.

01:38:03.003 --> 01:38:04.087
Where's Dr. Clay?

01:38:04.296 --> 01:38:05.589
She's in X-ray.

01:38:14.348 --> 01:38:15.849
Get your things.
We're out of here.

01:38:16.016 --> 01:38:17.934
I'm not going
anywhere with you.

01:38:20.062 --> 01:38:21.313
Oh, yes, you are.

01:38:21.521 --> 01:38:23.065
Let's go.
Now!

01:38:24.232 --> 01:38:25.150
Forget it.

01:38:31.531 --> 01:38:34.910
Doc, the man is crazy.

01:38:37.204 --> 01:38:38.622
And you're not?

01:38:42.709 --> 01:38:44.586
Now, get out of here.

01:39:20.330 --> 01:39:21.665
Yo.

01:39:21.873 --> 01:39:23.667
Wake the fuck up.

01:39:23.875 --> 01:39:25.252
We're out of here.

01:39:27.295 --> 01:39:29.172
I said one beer, sefior.

01:40:34.237 --> 01:40:35.322
Remember that blonde?

01:40:35.530 --> 01:40:37.699
Whew! She could
suck-start a Harley.

01:40:40.619 --> 01:40:41.745
There he is.

01:41:00.305 --> 01:41:01.640
Get outta here!

01:41:38.885 --> 01:41:40.345
Find that prick.

01:42:00.323 --> 01:42:01.074
Carter!

01:42:08.665 --> 01:42:09.499
Shit!

01:42:55.545 --> 01:42:56.671
Tails again.

01:43:37.962 --> 01:43:39.589
I hate this place.

01:44:08.618 --> 01:44:10.453
Mr. Wesley!

01:44:14.708 --> 01:44:16.167
You're made for each other.

01:44:27.595 --> 01:44:30.932
I see you found my
trophy room, Dalton.

01:44:31.975 --> 01:44:33.351
The only thing that's missing

01:44:34.561 --> 01:44:35.395
is your ass.

01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:40.400
What's this all about anyway?

01:44:41.234 --> 01:44:42.610
Your friend Wade?

01:44:43.236 --> 01:44:44.112
One old man?

01:44:45.321 --> 01:44:47.073
That's what I call
a mercy killing.

01:44:47.282 --> 01:44:48.867
I took him out of his misery.

01:44:49.993 --> 01:44:52.370
Now, you're not mad at
me about that, are you?

01:44:53.830 --> 01:44:55.665
Hell, you took Jimmy.

01:44:55.874 --> 01:44:57.709
He was in better shape.

01:45:02.088 --> 01:45:04.257
Hell, you took all my boys.

01:45:20.148 --> 01:45:22.192
Now, come on out, Dalton.

01:45:24.527 --> 01:45:27.781
This town is big
enough for both of us.

01:45:27.989 --> 01:45:29.699
Let's talk about this.

01:46:37.976 --> 01:46:40.019
I thought it would be
fun to fight you, Dalton.

01:46:40.895 --> 01:46:41.813
I really did.

01:46:44.357 --> 01:46:47.193
But now I just
don't have the time.

01:47:22.437 --> 01:47:23.229
No!

01:47:25.106 --> 01:47:26.065
It's over!

01:47:44.584 --> 01:47:48.129
This is our town, and
don't you forget it.

01:48:26.501 --> 01:48:27.585
Brad, where are you?

01:48:27.752 --> 01:48:29.253
They're in here, sheriff.

01:48:37.845 --> 01:48:38.972
All right.

01:48:39.180 --> 01:48:41.683
Who's gonna tell me what
the hell happened here?

01:48:42.475 --> 01:48:44.268
I didn't see nothing.

01:48:45.687 --> 01:48:47.522
You see anything, Pete?

01:48:47.730 --> 01:48:49.565
No, I didn't see anything.

01:48:49.774 --> 01:48:51.442
You see anything, red?

01:48:52.402 --> 01:48:53.111
I didn't see nothing.

01:48:53.319 --> 01:48:54.195
Not a thing.

01:48:55.363 --> 01:48:57.407
You see anything, tinker?

01:49:06.791 --> 01:49:09.043
A polar bear fell on me.

01:50:49.685 --> 01:50:53.731
<i>A' sorrow covers
you up like a cape</i>
