WEBVTT

00:05.739 --> 00:09.243
Man:
PREVIOUSLY ON
"IN TREATMENT"...

00:09.343 --> 00:11.512
- CHARMED, I'M SURE.
- ( chuckles )

00:11.612 --> 00:14.382
Sophie: SO YESTERDAY
I MARCHED INTO THE GYM
AND I GOT UP ON THE BEAM.

00:14.482 --> 00:16.217
AND WHEN I LOOKED BACK
AT MY FEET,

00:16.317 --> 00:17.851
THEY WERE
RIGHT ON THE BEAM.

00:17.951 --> 00:20.020
SOPHIE, LOOK AT ME.

00:20.121 --> 00:22.156
WHAT GOES ON IN THERE?

00:22.256 --> 00:24.792
THE NEW GUY
WITH THE TEQUILA.

00:24.892 --> 00:26.160
WE HAD SEX AND...

00:26.260 --> 00:28.062
AFTERWARDS HE SAID
THAT I FUCKED

00:28.162 --> 00:30.064
LIKE SOMEONE WHO'S
BEEN SEXUALLY ABUSED.

00:30.164 --> 00:32.400
- ( inhaling deeply )
- ( sobbing )

00:34.135 --> 00:35.536
THAT PRICK.

00:37.505 --> 00:40.641
I'M TRYING
TO KILL MYSELF.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.218
( water sloshing )

00:51.352 --> 00:53.454
( whispering )
SOPHIE.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.055
OH, GOD.

01:04.565 --> 01:07.401
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT LIPSTICK COLOR
REMINDS ME OF?

01:08.669 --> 01:10.338
DOG SHIT.

01:10.438 --> 01:12.506
THAT'S RIGHT, SOPHIE.
KEEP IT UP.

01:12.606 --> 01:15.476
THAT'S RIGHT, OLIVIA.
KEEP FEELING SORRY
FOR YOURSELF.

01:15.576 --> 01:17.145
( clicking )

01:23.617 --> 01:25.686
DO WE HAVE TO WAIT
UNTIL EXACTLY 4:00?

01:25.786 --> 01:28.456
IF YOU AND YOUR
SURGICAL ENHANCEMENTS
STEP INTO THAT ROOM,

01:28.556 --> 01:30.858
I'M NEVER COMING
BACK HERE... EVER.

01:30.958 --> 01:32.793
HE ASKED ME TO COME.

01:32.893 --> 01:35.095
AND YOU PROMISED
YOU WOULDN'T GO
BACK TO THE GYM

01:35.196 --> 01:37.131
UNLESS HE SAID
IT WAS OKAY.
YOU PROMISED.

01:37.231 --> 01:38.999
( chuckles )

01:39.099 --> 01:42.203
YOU MAKE IT SEEM LIKE
I'M GOING TO CONTAMINATE
THE PLACE OR SOMETHING.

01:42.303 --> 01:45.239
- I'M SURE YOU WILL.
- OH, SOPHIE, BACK OFF.

01:45.339 --> 01:46.640
WHY COULDN'T YOU
JUST CALL HIM?

01:46.740 --> 01:48.909
THEY HAVE THIS THING NOW,
IT'S CALLED A TELEPHONE.

01:49.009 --> 01:51.379
IF I WOULD'VE CALLED HIM
AND HE SAID YOU
SHOULDN'T TRAIN,

01:51.479 --> 01:53.481
YOU WOULD'VE SAID
I WAS LYING.

01:53.581 --> 01:57.851
I JU-- I JUST WANT TO BE
IN THE ROOM WITH YOU
WHEN HE ANSWERS US.

01:57.951 --> 02:00.888
THERE IS NO US.
I'M LEAVING.

02:00.988 --> 02:02.890
SOPHIE.

02:02.990 --> 02:05.025
PLEASE?

02:05.125 --> 02:07.628
YOU PROMISED.

02:18.539 --> 02:21.141
( theme music playing )

02:39.193 --> 02:40.994
AH. HELLO, OLIVIA.

02:41.094 --> 02:43.063
- NICE TO MEET YOU, FINALLY.
- YOU TOO.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.798
COME ON IN. SOPHIE.

02:46.800 --> 02:49.303
I-I-- THAT'S OKAY,
I'M JUST GONNA BE A MINUTE.

02:49.403 --> 02:51.239
WELL, WHY DON'T WE TAKE
THAT MINUTE INSIDE?

02:51.339 --> 02:55.008
- I DON'T WANT TO INTRUDE.
- YOU'RE NOT INTRUDING.
I CALLED YOU.

02:55.108 --> 02:56.677
BUT I DON'T WANT
TO BE IN THE WAY.

02:56.777 --> 02:59.480
I PROMISE YOU
NOTHING TERRIBLE WILL
HAPPEN IF YOU COME INSIDE.

02:59.580 --> 03:02.516
DON'T BET
THE FARM ON THAT.

03:08.222 --> 03:11.225
( whispering )
SHE SAYS SHE WON'T COME BACK
TO THERAPY IF I GO IN.

03:11.325 --> 03:13.594
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
- I THINK IT'LL BE FINE.

03:13.694 --> 03:14.862
COME ON.

03:25.773 --> 03:28.909
SOPHIE, CAN YOU
TAKE YOUR BAG OFF
THE COUCH, PLEASE?

03:33.314 --> 03:34.648
THANK YOU.

03:34.748 --> 03:36.284
PLEASE.

03:47.728 --> 03:50.464
I, UH-- I ASKED YOU
BOTH HERE TODAY, BECAUSE--

03:50.564 --> 03:53.033
JUST TELL HER THAT
I CAN KEEP TRAINING.

03:53.133 --> 03:55.636
OTHERWISE I'M STUCK
AT HOME WITH HER.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.705
SHE PROMISED
THAT SHE WOULDN'T
GO BACK TO TRAINING

03:57.805 --> 03:59.907
- UNLESS YOU SAID IT WAS OKAY.
- I NEVER SAID THAT.

04:00.007 --> 04:02.175
20 MINUTES AGO
IN THE CAR, YOU SAID
YOU WOULDN'T GO BACK

04:02.276 --> 04:04.945
- UNLESS PAUL SAID--
- I SAID I'D LISTEN TO
WHAT PAUL HAS TO SAY,

04:05.045 --> 04:08.549
NOT DO WHAT HE SAYS.
GOD, YOU'RE LIKE THE QUEEN
OF SELECTIVE HEARING.

04:08.649 --> 04:11.118
IT JUST SEEMS
CRAZY TO ME, AFTER ALL
THAT SHE'S BEEN THROUGH,

04:11.218 --> 04:13.220
FOR HER TO JUST
WALTZ BACK INTO THE GYM.

04:13.321 --> 04:15.623
I MEAN, IT'S NOT
LIKE SHE'S INJURED.

04:15.723 --> 04:17.558
- THAT'S NOT THE PROBLEM.
- YOU'RE THE PROBLEM.

04:17.658 --> 04:19.259
I'M THE PROBLEM.
THAT'S RIGHT. ALWAYS.

04:19.360 --> 04:22.763
YES, ALWAYS. YOU'RE ONE
GARGANTUAN PROBLEM.

04:25.366 --> 04:27.335
LET ME ASK YOU
SOMETHING, SOPHIE.

04:27.435 --> 04:29.970
DO YOU-- DO YOU FEEL
THAT YOU ARE READY
TO GO BACK

04:30.070 --> 04:31.672
- TO TRAINING?
- YES.

04:31.772 --> 04:34.642
BUT YOU CAN ALSO
UNDERSTAND HOW
YOUR MOM IS

04:34.742 --> 04:36.510
A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED
ABOUT THAT.

04:36.610 --> 04:39.246
SHE'S A CRAZY BITCH.
NOBODY UNDERSTANDS HER.

04:39.347 --> 04:41.515
I THINK
I UNDERSTAND HER.

04:49.222 --> 04:50.891
IF I STAY
AT HOME WITH HER,

04:50.991 --> 04:53.260
I WILL EITHER
SLIT MY WRISTS
OR I'LL GO POSTAL,

04:53.361 --> 04:54.862
AND THEY'LL SHUT ME
IN THE LOONY BIN.

04:54.962 --> 04:58.298
AND YOU WON'T BE THERE
TO GET ME OUT NEXT TIME.

05:00.233 --> 05:01.602
I THINK--

05:01.702 --> 05:03.671
I THINK YOUR MOM
IS CONCERNED

05:03.771 --> 05:06.740
ABOUT WHETHER
YOU'RE READY MENTALLY

05:06.840 --> 05:09.142
FOR THE STRESS
YOU'LL BE UNDER
WHEN YOU GO BACK.

05:09.242 --> 05:11.278
I CAN DEAL
WITH STRESS.

05:11.379 --> 05:12.713
IF YOU CAN'T,
YOU DON'T BELONG THERE.

05:12.813 --> 05:14.482
- IT'S NOT FOR SISSIES.
- ( sighs )

05:14.582 --> 05:15.949
- WHY ARE YOU SIGHING?
- I'M NOT SIGHING.

05:16.049 --> 05:17.918
- I JUST HEARD YOU.
- I-- I WAS JUST BREATHING.

05:18.018 --> 05:19.720
- I'M NOT ALLOWED
TO BREATHE ANYMORE?
- YOU WERE SIGHING.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.955
Paul: SOPHIE.

05:24.291 --> 05:26.694
IF I DON'T TRY OUT
FOR THE OLYMPICS,

05:26.794 --> 05:29.363
- I'LL KILL MYSELF FOR REAL.
- Paul: SOPHIE, ENOUGH.

05:29.463 --> 05:30.964
NO MORE THREATS.

05:31.064 --> 05:33.100
NO MORE.

05:39.407 --> 05:41.475
- THANK YOU, DOCTOR.
- SHUT UP.

05:41.575 --> 05:43.577
WHAT ARE YOU
EVEN DOING HERE?

05:43.677 --> 05:45.813
WHY CAN'T YOU
GET YOUR OWN LIFE
AND BUTT OUT OF MINE?

05:45.913 --> 05:47.948
THAT'S RIGHT,
BECAUSE MY VERY PRESENCE
MAKES ANY SPACE I ENTER

05:48.048 --> 05:50.083
- AUTOMATICALLY TOXIC TO YOU.
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.119
- WELL, I HOPE
MY MONEY ISN'T TOXIC TOO.
- I DON'T NEED YOUR MONEY.

05:52.219 --> 05:54.688
RIGHT, BECAUSE YOU
CAN ALWAYS FALL BACK
ON YOUR FATHER'S MONEY.

06:03.997 --> 06:07.601
SO WHAT IS IT, PAUL?
TO TRAIN OR NOT TO TRAIN?

06:11.872 --> 06:15.175
OLIVIA, I UNDERSTAND
YOUR CONCERNS

06:15.275 --> 06:19.847
AND WHY YOU
WOULDN'T WANT SOPHIE
TO GO BACK TO THE GYM.

06:19.947 --> 06:23.717
BUT-- AND I HAVE GIVEN THIS
A GREAT DEAL OF THOUGHT--

06:25.686 --> 06:30.591
I DO THINK THAT
SOPHIE SHOULD CONTINUE
HER PROGRAM OF TRAINING.

06:32.359 --> 06:34.027
WHAT?

06:35.095 --> 06:38.031
- ARE YOU SURE?
- YES.

06:38.131 --> 06:41.401
- I THINK THAT
THE GYM IS A PLACE--
- Olivia: OKAY, BUT--

06:41.502 --> 06:43.871
UMM, I DON'T KNOW.

06:43.971 --> 06:46.339
SEE, I JUST THOUGHT
AFTER EVERYTHING--

06:46.440 --> 06:48.742
- ARE YOU DEAF?
- NO, SOPHIE, I'M NOT DEAF.

06:48.842 --> 06:51.144
- SO YOU HEARD HIM?
- YES, I HEARD HIM.

06:51.244 --> 06:52.913
SO WHY ARE YOU
STILL TALKING?

06:54.982 --> 06:57.985
- ( sobs )
- HERE COME
THE WATERWORKS.

07:01.021 --> 07:03.657
- ( softly ) I'M GONNA
WAIT IN THE CAR.
- HALLELUJAH.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.092
I WOULD PREFER
IF YOU STAYED.

07:05.192 --> 07:07.060
- IF SHE STAYS, I'M SO OU--
- SOPHIE, PLEASE.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.096
I CAN SEE MYSELF OUT.

07:11.098 --> 07:13.033
- DR. WESTON--
- PAUL.

07:13.133 --> 07:16.937
PAUL, I NEVER GOT
A CHANCE TO THANK YOU

07:17.037 --> 07:19.573
FOR ALL THE STRINGS
THAT YOU PULLED
AT THE HOSPITAL.

07:19.673 --> 07:23.010
IF IT WASN'T FOR YOU,
THEY WOULD HAVE COMMITTED HER
FOR GOD KNOWS HOW LONG.

07:23.110 --> 07:24.912
ACTUALLY, IT DOESN'T
QUITE WORK LIKE THAT.

07:25.012 --> 07:29.617
SHE WOULD HAVE HAD
AN UNCOMFORTABLE NIGHT
OR TWO, BUT...

07:29.717 --> 07:33.386
WELL, IN ANY CASE,
THANK YOU.

07:33.487 --> 07:35.523
( softly )
YOU'RE WELCOME.

07:47.901 --> 07:49.637
MAKE SURE
SHE WALKED AWAY.

07:49.737 --> 07:51.505
SHE COULD STILL BE THERE,
LISTENING THROUGH THE DOOR.

07:51.605 --> 07:53.140
SOPHIE, SHE'S NOT
LISTENING AT THE DOOR.

07:53.240 --> 07:56.143
- ( footsteps fading )
- SHE'S-- SHE'S GONE.

08:04.451 --> 08:07.020
YOU'RE PRETTY
CONFIDENT TODAY.

08:07.120 --> 08:09.690
CONFIDENT HOW?

08:09.790 --> 08:12.225
SENDING ME BACK
TO THE GYM LIKE
NOTHING HAPPENED.

08:12.325 --> 08:15.262
HMM, SO WHERE DO YOU THINK
MY CONFIDENCE COMES FROM?

08:15.362 --> 08:18.398
SPECIAL DELIVERY
FROM OLD PEOPLE LAND.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.868
( chuckles )

08:20.968 --> 08:24.638
I'M CONFIDENT
BECAUSE I THINK
I'VE FIGURED OUT WHY--

08:24.738 --> 08:28.108
WHY YOU TOOK THOSE PILLS
IN MY BATHROOM LAST WEEK.

08:31.845 --> 08:35.015
I THINK YOU WERE
TESTING ME, SOPHIE.

08:35.115 --> 08:37.017
AND I PASSED THE TEST.

08:37.117 --> 08:38.385
BARELY...

08:38.485 --> 08:40.287
BUT I DID PASS IT.

08:40.387 --> 08:43.190
SO MAYBE
YOU CAN TRUST ME NOW,

08:43.290 --> 08:45.626
'CAUSE I TRUST YOU.

08:49.429 --> 08:51.699
ONE THING
THAT BOTHERS ME, THOUGH:

08:51.799 --> 08:55.435
WHAT IF YOU DECIDED
TO TEST SOMEBODY ELSE,

08:55.535 --> 08:58.305
AND THEY DIDN'T KNOW
IT WAS A TEST?

08:58.405 --> 09:00.674
DOESN'T MATTER TO ME.
I'D BE DEAD.

09:00.774 --> 09:03.744
I THINK ONE
OF THE THINGS THAT
WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT IS

09:03.844 --> 09:06.179
WHAT YOU FIND
SO ATTRACTIVE ABOUT--

09:06.279 --> 09:08.616
ABOUT DYING.

09:08.716 --> 09:11.551
WHAT DOES DYING
MEAN TO YOU?

09:13.453 --> 09:15.488
- FREEDOM.
- FREEDOM FROM WHAT?

09:15.589 --> 09:18.225
YOU AND YOUR
STUPID QUESTIONS.

09:19.226 --> 09:21.128
AND WHAT ELSE?

09:23.230 --> 09:24.798
MY MOTHER.

09:24.898 --> 09:27.701
SO YOU THINK DEATH IS
THE ONLY WAY TO ESCAPE
YOUR MOTHER?

09:27.801 --> 09:29.569
I'M PRETTY SURE
EVEN DEATH WON'T DO.

09:29.670 --> 09:30.804
WELL, LET ME
ASK YOU THIS:

09:30.904 --> 09:33.273
IF YOUR MOM
WASN'T AROUND...

09:33.373 --> 09:35.943
WOULD YOU
STILL WANT TO DIE?

09:37.444 --> 09:39.379
I HAVE NO IDEA,
DIPSHIT.

09:39.479 --> 09:41.815
OH, I'M IRRITATING
YOU NOW.

09:42.616 --> 09:44.051
MMM.

09:50.390 --> 09:52.192
SOPHIE.

09:55.929 --> 09:59.432
SEE, WHAT YOU'RE DOING NOW
IS YOU'RE SHUTTING ME OUT.

09:59.532 --> 10:01.301
IS THAT WHAT YOU DO
TO YOUR MOM?

10:04.872 --> 10:09.276
WHAT ELSE DOES DEATH
MEAN TO YOU?

10:15.015 --> 10:16.449
SLEEPING WELL.

10:16.549 --> 10:18.919
AH. AND WHAT DOES
SLEEPING WELL MEAN?

10:19.019 --> 10:22.923
- NOT FEELING.
- NOT FEELING WHAT?

10:23.023 --> 10:24.958
ANYTHING.

10:25.058 --> 10:26.593
MMM.

10:26.694 --> 10:28.829
WHEN YOU SAY
"NOT FEELING ANYTHING"

10:28.929 --> 10:31.631
DO YOU MEAN FEELING...

10:31.732 --> 10:34.802
( exhales )
LIKE, CALM?

10:43.376 --> 10:47.414
IS THERE ANYPLACE
IN YOUR LIFE WHERE YOU--
WHERE YOU FEEL CALM?

10:48.882 --> 10:50.984
NOT HERE,
THAT'S FOR SURE.

10:51.084 --> 10:54.154
OKAY, TELL ME
WHAT YOU FEEL
WHEN YOU'RE HERE.

10:59.192 --> 11:00.694
SOPHIE.

11:02.395 --> 11:03.964
SOPHIE.

11:07.534 --> 11:11.104
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO TALK ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED LAST WEEK?

11:15.308 --> 11:18.912
WE WENT TO A--
A PRETTY PAINFUL PLACE.

11:19.646 --> 11:21.715
IT WAS A PLACE OF...

11:22.615 --> 11:24.284
GREAT FEELING.

11:24.384 --> 11:26.486
AND THEN SUDDENLY YOU...

11:26.586 --> 11:30.123
YOU WENT TO THE BATHROOM
AND YOU PUT YOURSELF TO SLEEP.

11:30.223 --> 11:32.059
I...

11:33.526 --> 11:35.028
GO ON.

11:37.464 --> 11:39.266
I CAN'T DESCRIBE IT.

11:40.934 --> 11:42.569
WHAT CAN'T YOU DESCRIBE?

11:42.669 --> 11:44.037
WHAT I FELT, PAUL.

11:44.137 --> 11:47.007
GOD. DOES EVERYTHING
HAVE TO BE TALKED ABOUT?

11:47.107 --> 11:50.510
- IT'S TOO FUCKING HARD.
- I NEED YOU TO TRY, SOPHIE.

11:50.610 --> 11:52.679
- YOU TRY.
- YOU WANT ME TO TRY

11:52.780 --> 11:55.382
TO EXPRESS
WHAT YOU FEEL?

12:06.059 --> 12:08.762
I TRIED TO MAKE
MYSELF THROW UP
BUT NOTHING CAME OUT.

12:11.664 --> 12:12.933
HMM.

12:16.770 --> 12:19.973
DO YOU REMEMBER
AFTER THE ACCIDENT
YOU SAID,

12:21.074 --> 12:24.144
"I FINALLY KILLED HER"?

12:25.078 --> 12:27.214
WHAT DID
YOU MEAN BY THAT?

12:28.248 --> 12:29.917
I DON'T KNOW.

12:32.052 --> 12:35.355
YOU KNOW,
WE HAVE THESE TWO SIDES
TO OUR PERSONALITIES--

12:35.455 --> 12:38.058
YOU KNOW, THE WEAK SIDE
AND THE STRONG SIDE--

12:38.158 --> 12:40.393
AND THEY'RE CONSTANTLY
IN CONFLICT WITH EACH OTHER.

12:40.493 --> 12:44.364
SOMETIMES THE WEAKER SIDE
IS SNEAKY AND IT'S CRAFTY,

12:44.464 --> 12:45.933
AND IT WINS.

12:46.033 --> 12:48.035
WELL, FOR EXAMPLE,
WHEN YOU LET SOMEBODY

12:48.135 --> 12:50.570
BUY YOU SHOES THAT
YOU DON'T REALLY WANT

12:50.670 --> 12:52.940
OR WHEN YOU HAVE SEX
WITH SOMEBODY

12:53.040 --> 12:56.944
THAT YOU DON'T REALLY WANT
TO HAVE SEX WITH.

12:58.745 --> 13:00.313
SEE, WHEN IT COMES
TO SPORTS,

13:00.413 --> 13:03.350
YOU ARE COMPLETELY
CONFIDENT ON THE BEAM.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.218
YOU ARE REALLY POWERFUL.

13:05.318 --> 13:08.321
BUT OFF THE BEAM,
WHEN YOU'RE NOT A GYMNAST,

13:08.421 --> 13:10.090
WHEN YOU'RE JUST A GIRL,
WHEN YOU'RE A YOUNG WOMAN,

13:10.190 --> 13:13.460
THAT PART OF YOU
IS LESS SECURE.

13:13.560 --> 13:16.396
AND YOU SEEM MORE--

13:16.496 --> 13:19.199
WHAT'S THE WORD I'M
LOOKING FOR? MORE...

13:19.299 --> 13:22.970
- SUSCEPTIBLE. DO YOU--
- I KNOW WHAT
SUSCEPTIBLE MEANS.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.477
I HATE THAT PART OF ME.

13:30.577 --> 13:32.980
BUT THEY'RE
BOTH YOU, SOPHIE.

13:45.558 --> 13:48.595
SO DO YOU REALLY THINK
IT'S OKAY IF I GO BACK
TO TRAINING?

13:48.695 --> 13:50.697
MM-HMM.

13:50.797 --> 13:54.001
YES, I DO.
BUT HERE'S THE THING:

13:55.768 --> 13:59.139
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I'M GOING TO
BE HERE FOR YOU,

13:59.239 --> 14:03.310
ANYTIME.
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS JUST CALL ME--

14:03.410 --> 14:04.811
BUT ON ONE CONDITION:

14:04.912 --> 14:08.048
I WANT YOU TO KNOW THIS
AND UNDERSTAND IT
REALLY CLEARLY.

14:08.148 --> 14:10.083
I WILL NOT TREAT YOU
UNDER THE THREAT OF SUICIDE.

14:10.183 --> 14:11.851
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

14:16.123 --> 14:18.725
AND IF I DON'T AGREE,
THEN I CAN'T GO
BACK TO THE GYM.

14:18.825 --> 14:21.995
THEN YOU CANNOT
COME BACK HERE, EVER.

14:29.302 --> 14:30.503
SO,

14:32.805 --> 14:34.541
DO WE HAVE A DEAL?

14:45.118 --> 14:47.154
YOU SAID BEFORE
THAT I WAS TESTING YOU.

14:47.254 --> 14:49.957
YOU SAID THAT
YOU BARELY PASSED.

14:50.057 --> 14:52.392
THE FACT THAT
YOU WERE TESTING ME
AT ALL, SOPHIE,

14:52.492 --> 14:54.261
THAT'S A KIND
OF A FAILURE FOR ME,

14:54.361 --> 14:58.031
THAT YOU SHOULD FEEL
THAT YOU HAD TO TEST
MY LOVE FOR YOU.

14:59.299 --> 15:00.700
YOUR LOVE?

15:00.800 --> 15:02.102
YEAH.

15:02.202 --> 15:04.637
I CAN'T TREAT SOMEBODY
THAT I DON'T LOVE.

15:06.839 --> 15:10.877
I HAVE TO FIND SOMETHING
IN EACH OF MY PATIENTS
THAT I LOVE,

15:10.978 --> 15:13.413
OTHERWISE I WON'T
BE ABLE TO TREAT THEM.

15:14.982 --> 15:16.883
I BET YOU HAD TO SEARCH ME
WITH A MAGNIFYING GLASS

15:16.984 --> 15:18.952
TO FIND
SOMETHING TO LOVE.

15:23.456 --> 15:25.325
I REMEMBER THE FIRST DAY
THAT YOU CAME HERE

15:25.425 --> 15:27.995
AND YOU WERE WALKING AROUND
THE OFFICE AND YOU--

15:28.095 --> 15:32.165
AND YOU ASKED ME
ABOUT THESE BOATS.
YOU SAID TO ME,

15:32.265 --> 15:36.036
"ARE THESE HERE
BECAUSE YOU DON'T
REALLY SAIL?"

15:36.136 --> 15:37.937
AND I SAID, "YEAH."

15:38.038 --> 15:42.442
AND YOU SAID, "WELL,
MAYBE YOU SHOULD MAKE
ONE OF THOSE GLASS WINDOWS

15:42.542 --> 15:45.445
LIKE THEY HAVE
ON BOATS SO THAT
YOU CAN SEE THE WORLD."

15:45.545 --> 15:47.814
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?

15:47.914 --> 15:49.616
WHEN YOU SAID THAT...

15:51.218 --> 15:53.886
I-- I THINK THAT'S
WHEN I STARTED TO--

15:53.987 --> 15:56.189
TO LOVE WHO YOU ARE.

16:06.699 --> 16:08.635
YOU SAY IT
LIKE IT'S EASY.

16:08.735 --> 16:12.039
YOU'RE NOT USED TO
PEOPLE SAYING
"I LOVE YOU"?

16:13.740 --> 16:16.276
MY DAD.

16:16.376 --> 16:18.978
- HE TELLS YOU THAT?
- HE DOESN'T HAVE TO.

16:21.148 --> 16:24.017
MMM. I WAS SURPRISED
I DIDN'T SEE HIM

16:24.117 --> 16:26.919
IN THE HOSPITAL
WHEN I WENT TO VISIT YOU.

16:27.020 --> 16:28.455
YOU JUST MISSED HIM.

16:29.656 --> 16:30.857
UH-HUH.

16:30.957 --> 16:33.026
WHAT-- WHAT DOES HE DO,
DO YOU THINK,

16:33.126 --> 16:36.296
TO-- TO EARN YOUR LOVE?

16:36.396 --> 16:39.666
- WHY?
- MAYBE I CAN
STEAL HIS SECRETS

16:39.766 --> 16:41.568
AND GIVE THEM
TO YOUR MOM.

16:43.036 --> 16:45.572
- HILARIOUS.
- MMM.

16:48.975 --> 16:51.778
BUT HOW DO YOU
KNOW HE DOES LOVE YOU
IF HE DOESN'T SAY IT?

16:51.878 --> 16:53.880
I DON'T NEED
TO HEAR HIM SAY IT.

16:53.980 --> 16:56.516
WORDS ARE BULLSHIT.
EVERYBODY LIES.

17:02.222 --> 17:04.924
I FEEL HIS LOVE.

17:05.024 --> 17:07.727
AND HE FEELS ME,
EVEN WHEN I'M FAR AWAY.

17:16.769 --> 17:18.071
WANT TO KNOW
A SECRET?

17:18.171 --> 17:21.007
I HAVE TO WEAR GLASSES
ALL THE TIME.

17:21.108 --> 17:25.044
MOST OF THE TIME
I WALK AROUND HALF-BLIND.
DO YOU KNOW WHY?

17:25.145 --> 17:28.715
- WHY?
- 'CAUSE I PREFER IT
THAT WAY.

17:28.815 --> 17:31.017
WITH MY GLASSES ON,
EVERYTHING IS TOO SHARP.

17:31.118 --> 17:33.853
WITHOUT THEM,
EVERYONE LOOKS--

17:33.953 --> 17:36.156
LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE GOT
PERFECT SKIN.

17:36.256 --> 17:38.758
SO MY MOTHER MUST LOOK
LIKE A SUPERMODEL TO YOU.

17:43.463 --> 17:45.064
WHY ARE YOU
TELLING ME THIS?

17:45.165 --> 17:47.500
I THINK YOUR FATHER LOOKS
BETTER IN THE DISTANCE,

17:47.600 --> 17:52.472
FAR AWAY, BLURRY.
BUT YOUR MOTHER IS
RIGHT UP CLOSE,

17:52.572 --> 17:56.176
AND SHE'S KIND OF
PAINFULLY CLEAR.

17:57.510 --> 18:00.547
I'M REALLY OVER
THIS CONVERSATION.

18:01.848 --> 18:03.516
YOU KNOW, BEFORE YOU
PASSED OUT LAST WEEK

18:03.616 --> 18:06.419
YOU SAID SOMETHING
ABOUT MODELS,

18:06.519 --> 18:08.988
SOMETHING ABOUT
A PHOTO SHOOT NOT
BEGINNING ON TIME.

18:09.088 --> 18:12.659
AND I REMEMBER THAT
YOU TOLD ME THAT YOUR DAD
WAS A PHOTOGRAPHER.

18:14.194 --> 18:16.929
DID YOUR DAD WORK WITH--
WITH MODELS?

18:17.029 --> 18:18.998
WHY ARE YOU
PICKING ON HIM?

18:19.098 --> 18:22.202
MY DAD IS THE ONLY PERSON
IN THIS WORLD WHO
REALLY LOVES ME.

18:22.302 --> 18:26.873
- WHY IS THAT SO HARD FOR YOU
TO GET YOUR HEAD AROUND?
- ( knocks on door )

18:26.973 --> 18:29.609
- OH.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:29.709 --> 18:32.279
I... FORGOT TO GIVE YOU
THE MONEY TO PAY PAUL.

18:32.379 --> 18:34.647
- ARE YOU LISTENING
THROUGH THE DOOR?
- OF COURSE NOT.

18:34.747 --> 18:36.416
I WAS IN THE CAR.

18:36.516 --> 18:38.485
I'M NOT GONNA LET HER
GO BACK TO THE GYM.

18:38.585 --> 18:40.987
THAT PLACE
IS KILLING HER.

18:41.087 --> 18:42.922
WHO ARE YOU
TO TAKE THE RISK?

18:43.022 --> 18:45.692
SHE ALMOST DIED HERE
ON YOUR SOFA

18:45.792 --> 18:48.661
AND YOU'RE JUST
DUSTING HER OFF
AND SENDING HER BACK.

18:50.297 --> 18:52.098
- NO.
- IF YOU DON'T
GET AWAY FROM HIM,

18:52.199 --> 18:54.534
I'M LEAVING HERE
AND I'M NEVER COMING BACK.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.669
- I'LL GO TO DAD.
- YOU'LL GO TO DAD'S?

18:56.769 --> 18:58.104
I WILL.

18:58.205 --> 18:59.806
GOOD. GO AHEAD.

18:59.906 --> 19:01.608
- Sophie: I WILL.
- GO AHEAD.

19:01.708 --> 19:04.611
CRY A LITTLE HARDER, MOM.
THAT'S GREAT.

19:04.711 --> 19:06.078
IF I BROUGHT HOME
THE OLYMPIC MEDAL,

19:06.179 --> 19:07.447
YOU'D PROBABLY DROWN
IN YOUR OWN TEARS.

19:07.547 --> 19:09.416
IF YOU BROUGHT HOME
AN OLYMPIC--

19:09.516 --> 19:12.919
STOP MAKING ME
LOOK LIKE A MONSTER
IN FRONT OF THE SHRINK!

19:18.425 --> 19:20.260
YES.

19:20.360 --> 19:23.129
YES, I THINK THAT
THE COMPETITION IS INSANE

19:23.230 --> 19:26.766
AND YOU'RE PUTTING
UNBELIEVABLE STRESS
ON YOUR YOUNG BODY.

19:26.866 --> 19:29.836
BUT I AM SO PROUD
OF YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS.

19:32.572 --> 19:35.408
ISN'T EVERY MOTHER
PROUD OF THEIR DAUGHTER?

19:35.508 --> 19:38.611
DON'T ASK HIM!
YOU WANT TO GO TO THERAPY,
GET YOUR OWN GUY.

19:38.711 --> 19:40.613
NOBODY WANTS YOU HERE.
NOW GET THE FUCK OUT!

19:40.713 --> 19:43.483
NOT UNTIL HE TELLS ME
HOW HE CAN SIT THERE

19:43.583 --> 19:45.151
- AND LET YOU GO BACK
TO SOMEPLACE--
- LET ME?

19:45.252 --> 19:46.986
YOU THINK I'M LIKE YOU?

19:47.086 --> 19:50.957
I'M SOME SORT OF CHILD
WHO NEEDS PERMISSION
TO DO ANYTHING?

19:51.057 --> 19:53.426
IF I WANT TO TRAIN,
I'LL TRAIN.

19:53.526 --> 19:56.062
IF I WANT TO KILL MYSELF,
I'LL KILL MYSELF.

19:56.162 --> 19:58.365
IF I WANT TO FUCK CY
IN MY HOSPITAL ROOM

19:58.465 --> 20:00.267
WHILE YOU'RE OUTSIDE
BANGING ON THE DOOR,

20:00.367 --> 20:03.403
THEN THAT'S WHAT
I'LL FUCKING DO.

20:05.137 --> 20:06.573
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

20:06.673 --> 20:08.541
YOU HEARD ME.

20:10.577 --> 20:14.747
YOU ARE NOT
GOING BACK TO THAT GYM.

20:14.847 --> 20:17.850
FINE. START LOOKING
FOR MY BURIAL PLOT.

20:17.950 --> 20:19.786
SOPHIE.

20:19.886 --> 20:22.689
I'M GOING BACK TO TRAINING
NEXT WEEK FOR THE OLYMPICS,

20:22.789 --> 20:25.725
AND IF YOU TRY
TO STOP ME, YOU WILL
NEVER SEE ME AGAIN.

20:25.825 --> 20:28.795
RIGHT, I HEARD YOU.
YOU'LL GO TO YOUR FATHER'S.

20:28.895 --> 20:32.465
ONLY HE'S IN MIAMI
PHOTOGRAPHING SUPERMODELS

20:32.565 --> 20:33.933
AND NO ONE CAN
GET AHOLD OF HIM.

20:34.033 --> 20:35.768
HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
SHE WAS IN THE HOSPITAL.

20:35.868 --> 20:38.004
- SHUT UP.
- HE HASN'T EVEN
CALLED HER

20:38.104 --> 20:41.274
IN OVER A MONTH.
HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

20:41.374 --> 20:42.875
BUT-- BUT OF COURSE
SHE'LL GO TO HIM,

20:42.975 --> 20:45.278
TO NEW YORK,
TO MIAMI,

20:45.378 --> 20:47.079
TO FUCKING TIMBUKTU.

20:47.179 --> 20:50.283
HE'S NOT HERE
AND IT'S MY FAULT!

20:50.383 --> 20:53.386
IT'S MY FAULT
BECAUSE I AM HERE.

20:53.486 --> 20:57.490
YOU KNOW,
MAYBE I'LL LEAVE YOU
ALONE FOR A FEW MONTHS

20:57.590 --> 20:59.426
AND THEN MAYBE YOU CAN
LOVE ME JUST A LITTLE.

20:59.526 --> 21:01.294
YES, JUST FUCK OFF!

21:21.047 --> 21:22.449
( lock clicks )

21:36.629 --> 21:39.432
IF SHE CAME
TO THERAPY, YOU'D NEED
A TISSUE PLANT NEXT DOOR.

21:39.532 --> 21:41.968
DID YOU HAVE SEX WITH CY
AT THE HOSPITAL?

21:44.236 --> 21:46.539
NO. THAT WAS JUST--

21:46.639 --> 21:48.941
SOPHIE, YOU'RE 16 YEARS
OF AGE. YOU'RE A MINOR,

21:49.041 --> 21:51.611
AND I'VE THOUGHT
LONG AND HARD ABOUT
WHETHER I SHOULD

21:51.711 --> 21:54.814
BRING LEGAL ACTION
AGAINST THIS GUY.

21:54.914 --> 21:57.617
YOU TOLD ME THERE
WAS NO SEXUAL CONTACT
BETWEEN YOU AND HIM

21:57.717 --> 21:59.719
AFTER THE FIRST TIME.
IS THAT TRUE?

21:59.819 --> 22:00.920
YES.

22:02.254 --> 22:04.090
NOTHING ELSE
HAS HAPPENED.

22:10.497 --> 22:12.064
DO YOU WANT IT
TO HAPPEN AGAIN?

22:12.164 --> 22:13.900
NO.

22:15.034 --> 22:17.169
SHOULD I STILL BE WORRIED
ABOUT YOU AND CY?

22:17.269 --> 22:19.005
NO!

22:31.484 --> 22:33.252
WHY IS MY MOM
SO PATHETIC?

22:33.352 --> 22:35.388
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T THINK
SHE IS PATHETIC.

22:35.488 --> 22:36.956
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I THINK SHE'S PRETTY STRONG.

22:37.056 --> 22:39.426
SHE SWALLOWS ALL THE CRAP
THAT YOU GIVE HER,

22:39.526 --> 22:40.893
AND SHE STILL
COMES BACK FOR MORE.

22:40.993 --> 22:43.129
SHE'S MAKING
EVERY MISTAKE IN THE BOOK,

22:43.229 --> 22:45.632
BUT DO YOU KNOW SOMETHING?
YOU PUNISH HER IN A MILLION
DIFFERENT WAYS

22:45.732 --> 22:47.667
AND SHE'S NEVER
GIVEN UP ON YOU.

22:47.767 --> 22:49.669
AND I KNOW
YOU DON'T WANT
TO HEAR THIS,

22:49.769 --> 22:52.505
BUT I DON'T THINK
YOU'VE GIVEN UP
ON HER EITHER.

23:02.449 --> 23:04.383
( sighs )
WE'RE OUT OF TIME,
AREN'T WE?

23:04.484 --> 23:07.987
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
THAT YOUR FATHER DIDN'T KNOW
YOU TRIED TO KILL YOURSELF?

23:09.288 --> 23:11.323
WHY WAS THAT
SUCH A BIG SECRET?

23:11.424 --> 23:13.526
IT'S NOT.
I HAVE TO GO.

23:17.163 --> 23:19.198
WHAT ABOUT
OUR AGREEMENT?

23:19.298 --> 23:20.967
LET'S TALK
ABOUT IT NEXT WEEK.

23:21.067 --> 23:23.069
NO, WE WON'T TALK
ABOUT IT NEXT WEEK.

23:23.169 --> 23:25.004
WHAT ABOUT
OUR AGREEMENT?

23:31.410 --> 23:33.345
I WON'T TRY
AND KILL MYSELF

23:33.446 --> 23:35.081
AS LONG AS I'M
IN THERAPY, ALL RIGHT?

23:35.181 --> 23:37.049
SAY IT AGAIN.

23:38.585 --> 23:40.487
I WON'T TRY
AND KILL MYSELF

23:40.587 --> 23:42.722
AS LONG
AS I'M IN THERAPY.

23:47.293 --> 23:48.861
OKAY.

23:50.697 --> 23:54.000
( somber piano music
playing )
