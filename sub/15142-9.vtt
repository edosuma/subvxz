ANNOUNCER: <i>Previously</i>
<i>on</i> East Los High...

00:01.904 --> 00:04.443
I just lost my dancers.
No, look, I got you.

00:04.443 --> 00:06.146
We got a paying gig.

00:06.146 --> 00:07.883
Yeah, and it’s gonna pay
for our trip to Yuma.

00:07.883 --> 00:09.286
Shoot me the address.
On my way.

00:09.286 --> 00:11.491
On the ground!
GINA: Are you guys okay?

00:11.491 --> 00:12.893
FILI: Were you guys
in an accident?

00:12.893 --> 00:14.330
Yeah, we accidentally
met some cops.

00:14.330 --> 00:15.899
All right, come on, guys,
you’re already late.

00:15.899 --> 00:18.271
Hey, you guys killed it.

00:18.271 --> 00:20.175
You know what that means.
Yuma, I’m coming home!

00:20.175 --> 00:22.079
Hey, what are you doing here?

00:22.079 --> 00:24.284
I gotta talk to you.
I gotta lay low for a while.

00:24.284 --> 00:25.387
Where are you going?
I’ll call you.

00:29.228 --> 00:31.198
( gunshots )

00:31.198 --> 00:33.504
Don’t worry. I’m gonna take you
to the hospital.

00:33.504 --> 00:35.073
I said no hospitals!

00:35.073 --> 00:36.443
But you need
to see a doctor.

00:36.443 --> 00:38.047
No, they’re gonna call
the cops.

00:38.047 --> 00:39.215
But you could die!

00:39.215 --> 00:41.219
I said no hospitals!

00:42.990 --> 00:44.894
Oh, no.

00:44.894 --> 00:47.099
Oh, my God. What?
What happened?

00:47.099 --> 00:49.270
You’re gonna take Whittier?

00:49.270 --> 00:50.272
What?

00:55.316 --> 00:57.220
( door opens )

00:59.157 --> 01:01.663
Yo, you guys did a video shoot
without asking me

01:01.663 --> 01:03.199
and you almost got shot?

01:03.199 --> 01:05.304
What the hell
were you thinking?

01:05.304 --> 01:07.641
We were just trying
to raise money for Yuma.

01:07.641 --> 01:08.945
And we did.

01:08.945 --> 01:10.682
You did?

01:14.456 --> 01:16.527
Yo, what are we
standing around for?

01:16.527 --> 01:18.131
Let’s start rehearsing.

01:18.131 --> 01:21.370
We’re going to Yuma, bitches!

01:21.370 --> 01:23.709
OMAR: Yo, shit, man.
Those cops are goin’ down.

01:23.709 --> 01:26.046
After we sue their asses,

01:26.046 --> 01:28.185
I’m getting myself a silver
Maserati with alloyed rims.

01:28.185 --> 01:29.387
Slam.

01:29.387 --> 01:30.991
Guys, this isn’t about a car.

01:30.991 --> 01:32.728
It’s about standing up
for yourselves.

01:32.728 --> 01:34.297
Like anybody’s
gonna give a shit.

01:34.297 --> 01:36.001
We’ll go to
the Youth Justice Coalition.

01:36.001 --> 01:37.604
They’ll know how
to handle this.

01:37.604 --> 01:39.441
You don’t speak up,
it’s gonna keep happening.

01:39.441 --> 01:40.644
( phone vibrates )

01:40.644 --> 01:42.314
Guys, it’s Ceci.
She’s waiting. Let’s go.

01:42.314 --> 01:44.051
We’re gonna be late.
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

01:44.051 --> 01:46.356
You know what happened the last
time you took off running.

01:46.356 --> 01:47.559
Slow down.

01:47.559 --> 01:48.694
Gotcha.
All right.

But they’re crazy good.

02:40.636 --> 02:44.210
You gonna just kill their dreams

All right, fine.
They can go.

02:45.313 --> 02:47.584
Great!

02:47.584 --> 02:50.223
And I need a chaperone
for the boys.

Chap-chaperone?

I got the taqueria, okay?

say anything,

to look kind of old.

03:02.515 --> 03:03.652

03:03.652 --> 03:07.493
Ceci, I can’t, okay?
I can’t.

03:09.397 --> 03:11.301
Please, just say yes.

03:11.301 --> 03:13.305
We’re gonna be stuck
with Mr. Blankenship.

03:13.305 --> 03:15.309

( telephone ringing )

03:15.309 --> 03:17.614
There’s a rumor that he’s got
somebody living in his basement

03:17.614 --> 03:19.485
that doesn’t wanna be there.

03:19.485 --> 03:20.820
Come on, Jacob. Please?

03:20.820 --> 03:22.324
Tio Pepe’s.
How can I help you?

03:22.324 --> 03:23.559
Yeah.

03:23.559 --> 03:25.531
Hey, I gotta take this,
okay?

03:25.531 --> 03:27.300

Shit. Stupid <i>pendejo</i>
couldn’t shoot for shit.

03:49.514 --> 03:52.487
And thank God.
Let me see.

03:52.487 --> 03:53.824
( groans )

03:53.824 --> 03:56.395
Missed your heart
by like this much.

03:56.395 --> 03:59.201
See, I told you I got heart.

04:03.176 --> 04:05.347
It looks really bad.

04:05.347 --> 04:07.351
It can get infected.
Let me just take you...

04:07.351 --> 04:09.690
No, no, no, no, no. No, no.

04:09.690 --> 04:13.231
No hospitals.
They’re gonna call the cops.

04:13.231 --> 04:15.669
But you’re the victim here.
I ain’t no victim.

04:21.681 --> 04:24.420
Look, the less you know,
the better.

04:24.420 --> 04:27.159
Somebody out there
wants you dead.

04:27.159 --> 04:28.262
Who is it?

04:30.433 --> 04:33.540
It’s gonna leave
a nasty-ass scar.

04:33.540 --> 04:36.847
Guess who’s gonna win
Scar Wars.

04:36.847 --> 04:39.619
I ain’t playin’ that game
no more.

04:46.266 --> 04:48.505
Get ready for some East Los
Bomb Squad, Yuma!

Is that all you got?

04:53.748 --> 04:55.452
See, okay, now.

04:55.452 --> 04:56.655
I’m gonna take it back.

04:56.655 --> 05:00.496
ALL: Hey! Hey!

05:00.496 --> 05:02.834
CECI: Guys, save it
for the competition.

05:02.834 --> 05:04.404
Come on, let’s go.

05:04.404 --> 05:06.943
I made some sandwiches
for the road.

05:06.943 --> 05:09.181
You didn’t have to, Ma.

05:09.181 --> 05:11.519
Come on, it’s your big day.

05:11.519 --> 05:15.194

Wait.

Condoms?
Oh, my gosh, Ma.

05:26.952 --> 05:31.695
What? Dancing,
pool parties, hotels, come on.

05:31.695 --> 05:33.899

Hi, babe.

05:43.219 --> 05:44.955
What was that
all about?

05:44.955 --> 05:47.261
Can never be too safe
in Mom’s eyes, huh?

05:47.261 --> 05:48.764
Did you tell your mom
about...?

05:48.764 --> 05:51.235
No, that’s just how she rolls.

05:51.235 --> 05:52.338
She’s cool like that.

05:52.338 --> 05:55.411
You didn’t tell him, did you?

05:55.411 --> 05:57.817
How could I?

05:57.817 --> 06:01.023
I mean, he’s going
to a dance competition.

06:01.023 --> 06:03.395
He needs to focus.

06:03.395 --> 06:07.403
<i>Tu</i> diabetes is getting worse.
Your heart is failing.

06:07.403 --> 06:09.975
Please, Rosie. Not now.

06:09.975 --> 06:12.447
He deserves
to know how sick you are.

06:12.447 --> 06:15.487
I just want him
to follow his dreams, you know?

06:15.487 --> 06:17.624
And not worry about me.

06:19.328 --> 06:21.767
I just don’t know how
to tell him.

07:00.047 --> 07:02.652
No, we’re not lost.
I’m trusting you.

It says we are not lost.

07:05.425 --> 07:06.694

Vanessa.

07:16.815 --> 07:20.389
Vanessa? You let Vanessa
take care of Isela?

07:20.389 --> 07:22.628
Okay, so she’s actually turned
out to be a real good <i>tia.</i>

07:22.628 --> 07:24.899
I mean, I gave her
a $1000 bracelet, so.

07:24.899 --> 07:26.936
You gave her $1000 for one night
to babysit Isela?

07:26.936 --> 07:30.543
Yo, Isela better be
potty-trained by the time
I get back.

07:30.543 --> 07:32.447
She’s gotta be more
than potty-trained.

hooking up?

08:05.651 --> 08:07.822
Yeah, but don’t tell anyone.

My mouth was open.

08:27.663 --> 08:30.136
I had just left
the video shoot, so.

08:30.136 --> 08:33.542
Who was there

08:33.542 --> 08:35.046
Uh, I’m sorry.
Who’s this?

just warming up.

09:11.021 --> 09:13.025
Man, we’re gonna kick
some ass.

Oh, so I guess I’ll call
Detective Santos

09:59.856 --> 10:02.596
and tell him
that I have a witness.

10:02.596 --> 10:04.233

that Jesus and his brother,

10:06.605 --> 10:08.040
they used to work here.

10:08.040 --> 10:09.142
He has a brother?

10:09.142 --> 10:10.946
Had.

10:10.946 --> 10:13.051
He was killed last year
in Pomona.

10:13.051 --> 10:15.623
Oh, I guess he forgot
to tell you that, huh?

10:15.623 --> 10:17.728
I’m pretty sure
he was just protecting me.

10:17.728 --> 10:20.700
Camila, if you keep messing
with Jesus,

10:20.700 --> 10:23.941
you’re still in the game
and you’re in danger.

10:23.941 --> 10:25.644
You need to get out.

10:25.644 --> 10:28.617
Why do you care?

10:28.617 --> 10:33.661
Because getting killed is not
on my vision board.

10:33.661 --> 10:35.932
And it shouldn’t be
on yours either.

10:45.585 --> 10:48.158
All right, you guys
got everything you need?

10:48.158 --> 10:50.262
What about you?

10:50.262 --> 10:53.001
What is that
supposed to mean?

10:53.001 --> 10:54.906
So is your room
next to Jacob’s?

10:54.906 --> 10:57.177
With a door in between?

10:57.177 --> 10:59.716
Oh, romantic.

10:59.716 --> 11:01.319
Cut it out, you guys.
TIFFANY: What?

11:01.319 --> 11:03.323
We saw you all into each other
in the van.

11:03.323 --> 11:07.799
Looked like a little
something-something
was goin’ on.

11:07.799 --> 11:09.970
I don’t know what you guys
are talking about.

11:09.970 --> 11:12.776
We’re talking about
how Jacob is so into you.

11:12.776 --> 11:15.115
Look, there is nothing going on
with me and Jacob.

11:15.115 --> 11:17.119
Just because we’re friends
and he’s hot.

11:17.119 --> 11:19.758
Oh, so he’s hot?
Okay, I gotta go. I gotta go.

11:22.730 --> 11:25.937
Yeah, I just want to tell
you guys how proud I am of you.

11:25.937 --> 11:28.843
I know you don’t get it now,
but one day you’ll remember

11:28.843 --> 11:31.816
how special it was for all of us
to be here tonight together.

11:31.816 --> 11:33.119
TIFFANY: Aww.

11:33.119 --> 11:36.860
Group hug.
Hell, no. I just showered.

11:36.860 --> 11:40.066
Look, just make sure you get
some rest and go to bed--alone.

11:40.066 --> 11:41.269
That goes
for you too, Coach.

11:41.269 --> 11:43.641
Shut up, Fili.

11:43.641 --> 11:46.113
Time to break out
the jungle juice.

11:46.113 --> 11:47.148
Ohh.

11:52.359 --> 11:54.630
Hey.

11:54.630 --> 11:56.768
I got pain.

11:56.768 --> 12:00.777
Right there.

12:00.777 --> 12:02.380
What’s wrong?

12:02.380 --> 12:05.386
Think I’m falling
in love with you.

12:06.923 --> 12:09.696
So, what’s wrong with that?

12:09.696 --> 12:12.267
I don’t know
if I can be with you, though.

12:16.076 --> 12:18.781
So, what, the minute
there’s a problem, you’re out?

12:18.781 --> 12:20.785
What kind of love is that?

12:20.785 --> 12:22.990
I almost lost you.

12:22.990 --> 12:26.097
How can you live
like this?

12:26.097 --> 12:28.101
You want Mateo
to end up like you?

12:28.101 --> 12:29.804
Don’t bring Mateo into this.

12:29.804 --> 12:32.777
I provide for him.
I provide for my family.

12:32.777 --> 12:36.084
Yeah, but for how long until
you end up like your brother?

12:36.084 --> 12:39.057
Who told you about my brother?

12:39.057 --> 12:41.228
So it’s true?

12:47.174 --> 12:48.945
So, what, you don’t want
to be with me no more?

12:48.945 --> 12:52.284
I do wanna be with you.

12:52.284 --> 12:53.253
But not like this.

12:53.253 --> 12:55.158
Like this?

12:55.158 --> 12:58.364
This is how you met me.

12:58.364 --> 13:01.170
Well, you can’t change me.
You wanna change me now.

13:01.170 --> 13:04.042
I can’t change you, Jesus.
That’s right.
You can’t change me.

13:04.042 --> 13:05.846
You wanna go, go.

13:14.263 --> 13:17.137
( hip-hop playing )

13:21.178 --> 13:24.151
So who’s next?

13:24.151 --> 13:25.955
Never have I ever had sex
with someone

13:25.955 --> 13:28.327
without knowing their name.

13:28.327 --> 13:29.864
Done that.

13:29.864 --> 13:32.770
Dude, you’re a virgin.

13:32.770 --> 13:34.039
No, I’m not.

13:34.039 --> 13:36.944
Your hand don’t count,
fool.
( laughter )

13:40.118 --> 13:42.489
Okay.
Yeah.

13:42.489 --> 13:44.160
Never have I ever had sex

13:44.160 --> 13:45.530
in a motel room.

13:47.200 --> 13:48.502
Don’t get any ideas, virgin.

13:48.502 --> 13:51.008
( laughter )

13:51.008 --> 13:53.847
SANTI: Okay, my turn.

13:53.847 --> 13:57.888
Um, never have I ever had
a threesome with two hot chicks.

13:57.888 --> 14:01.229
And never
will you ever again.

14:01.229 --> 14:02.833
Ooh.

14:02.833 --> 14:03.868
Bye, Felipe.

14:03.868 --> 14:06.072
Ohh!

14:06.072 --> 14:08.311
Hey, Fili,
come get ice with me?

14:08.311 --> 14:10.348
I’m having fun. You go.
Please.

14:23.142 --> 14:24.912
What’s going on?

14:24.912 --> 14:27.217
Did Eddie get the room?

14:27.217 --> 14:29.021
Are you gonna go
meet up with him?

14:29.021 --> 14:31.459
I don’t know
if I want to do it now.

14:31.459 --> 14:33.864
Just because he’s flirting
and he spent some money

14:33.864 --> 14:35.868
doesn’t mean
you need to put out.

14:35.868 --> 14:38.474
Yeah, but, Fili,
I cock-teased him
the whole way here.

14:38.474 --> 14:41.180
Well, if he’s pissed,
that’s his problem.

14:41.180 --> 14:44.520
I really like him.
And I even got on the pill.

14:44.520 --> 14:46.324
Gina...

14:46.324 --> 14:49.463
you know how much I regret
that three-way, right?

14:49.463 --> 14:51.000
Yeah.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.570
Well, if you do this,

14:52.570 --> 14:56.211
is it something you’re gonna
regret it later?

14:56.211 --> 14:58.616
I’m just gonna go talk
to him.

14:58.616 --> 15:00.320
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

15:00.320 --> 15:02.524
Take this.
It’ll cool him down.

15:02.524 --> 15:04.127
( laughs )

15:04.127 --> 15:06.466
Good luck.

15:06.466 --> 15:09.372
( hip-hop playing )

15:11.543 --> 15:13.882
What took you so long?

15:21.999 --> 15:23.903
( knock on door )

15:30.216 --> 15:31.920
What do you want?

15:39.468 --> 15:43.376
I don’t like
the way our talk ended.

15:43.376 --> 15:46.884
I’m not changing my mind.

15:46.884 --> 15:49.289
I’m not about that life.

15:49.289 --> 15:53.397
I wanna be with you.

15:53.397 --> 15:57.272
I’ll do anything.

15:57.272 --> 15:58.475
I’ll even get out of the game.

16:05.456 --> 16:06.993
Come on.

16:06.993 --> 16:09.163
Come lay down in my room.

16:12.905 --> 16:15.176
Oh, see,

16:15.176 --> 16:17.648
now you’re just tryin’
to take advantage of me.

16:28.237 --> 16:30.976
Okay, I’m too weak.
I can’t resist you.

16:30.976 --> 16:31.978
( laughs )

16:35.652 --> 16:37.657
But we were sexting.

16:37.657 --> 16:39.528
I mean, was this
not the plan?

16:39.528 --> 16:42.100
I know, bae.
I’m sorry.

16:42.100 --> 16:43.369
I’m so into you.

16:43.369 --> 16:46.375
I just don’t think
I’m ready yet.

16:46.375 --> 16:48.513
Well, this sucks, Gina.

16:48.513 --> 16:50.617
Being with you is the only thing
I’ve been thinking about.

16:50.617 --> 16:53.023
It’s all I’ve been thinking
about too.

16:53.023 --> 16:55.294
I don’t know
what’s wrong with me.

16:55.294 --> 16:57.198
There’s nothing wrong
with you.

16:57.198 --> 17:02.041
You’re awesome, but I know
you been screwed over before.

17:02.041 --> 17:03.277
You can trust me.

17:03.277 --> 17:05.215
I’m not like
those other guys.

17:05.215 --> 17:07.419
I know you’re not.

17:07.419 --> 17:09.424
And we don’t gotta rush.

17:09.424 --> 17:11.428
You and me,
we got lots of time.

17:11.428 --> 17:13.332
Yeah?
Yeah.

17:13.332 --> 17:14.701
I’m not going anywhere.

17:14.701 --> 17:18.342
Except right now
to go take this cold shower.

17:18.342 --> 17:20.146
Let’s go in the pool.

17:20.146 --> 17:22.184
How about the Jacuzzi?

17:22.184 --> 17:26.492
How about we keep it
to the ice cold pool?

17:26.492 --> 17:28.096
( both laugh )

17:28.096 --> 17:30.701
Sure. My balls
are blue enough.

17:49.040 --> 17:51.478
Man, it’s like that?

17:51.478 --> 17:54.551
That’s with me being shot.

17:54.551 --> 17:57.023
Imagine if I’m at a hundred.

17:57.023 --> 17:59.762
Damn.

17:59.762 --> 18:01.566
I don’t wanna imagine.

18:01.566 --> 18:03.337
I wanna know.

18:07.712 --> 18:10.217
So did you mean
what you said?

18:11.754 --> 18:14.293
Of course.

18:14.293 --> 18:17.767
It’s all about you and Mateo
from now on.

18:30.226 --> 18:34.201
So you my girl now?

18:34.201 --> 18:36.072
I don’t know.

18:36.072 --> 18:39.178
I don’t really date
<i>Vatos Locos.</i>

18:42.552 --> 18:45.725
I think I still need
a little more convincing.

18:58.518 --> 19:00.089
JACOB:
It’s a nice view, huh?

19:01.525 --> 19:03.329
Yeah, it is.

19:09.341 --> 19:10.678
You ready for tomorrow?

19:10.678 --> 19:15.187
Kinda. I’m super nervous.

19:15.187 --> 19:19.295
Listen, don’t let Adrian
get to you.

19:19.295 --> 19:21.701
You got great moves.

19:24.139 --> 19:26.144
He’s such a douchebag,

19:26.144 --> 19:29.383
but he’s a great coach.

19:29.383 --> 19:31.354
Yeah, well,
you’re better.

19:34.126 --> 19:36.331
Hey, I’m really glad
that I came.

19:38.202 --> 19:41.341
Well, I told you
you’d have fun.

19:43.513 --> 19:45.517
I always have fun
when I’m with you.

19:45.517 --> 19:49.860
How come we never hang out
back home?

19:49.860 --> 19:52.364
Well, you know
I was with Pedro,

19:52.364 --> 19:56.373
and you were always busy
with school, work, and Maya.

19:56.373 --> 19:59.313
Busy with school and work
for sure.

19:59.313 --> 20:02.620
What about Maya?

20:02.620 --> 20:04.757
We’re done.

20:04.757 --> 20:06.361
I’m single.

20:08.532 --> 20:11.271
You?

20:11.271 --> 20:12.941
I’m a single mom.

20:14.478 --> 20:17.184
You’re a beautiful single mom.

20:22.795 --> 20:25.300
( shouts )

20:31.346 --> 20:33.818
Up for a midnight swim,
Coach Ceci?

20:33.818 --> 20:36.791
Hell, yeah, Coach Jacob.

20:36.791 --> 20:38.762
Let’s do it.

20:38.762 --> 20:41.734
( Bomb Squad playing
"Marco Cholo" )

20:53.694 --> 20:57.468
I gotta lay low
for a while.

20:57.468 --> 20:59.606
I’ll text you
the location.

20:59.606 --> 21:01.376
Okay.

21:14.236 --> 21:16.475
Get out of here.

21:21.919 --> 21:25.727
Ohh!

21:25.727 --> 21:29.602
What are you doing?

21:29.602 --> 21:32.054
Marco!
Cholo!

21:32.054 --> 21:34.022
Cholo!

21:34.022 --> 21:35.691
( laughter )

21:52.908 --> 21:54.876
( knock on door )

21:54.876 --> 21:57.045
Why d--

21:59.381 --> 22:02.284
Surprised?

22:02.284 --> 22:04.953
( Spanish song playing )
