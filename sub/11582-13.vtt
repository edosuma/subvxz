00:06.807 --> 00:08.576
(male narrator)
In the criminal justice system,

00:08.609 --> 00:12.313
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:12.346 --> 00:13.514
In New York City,

00:13.547 --> 00:15.416
the dedicated detectives
who investigate

00:15.449 --> 00:17.785
these vicious felonies
are members of an elite squad

00:17.818 --> 00:20.254
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:20.288 --> 00:21.422
These are their stories.

00:23.124 --> 00:24.292
Good night.

00:24.325 --> 00:25.359
(Cragen)
Good night.

00:25.393 --> 00:26.494
Good morning.

00:26.527 --> 00:29.063
You get your confession?

00:29.097 --> 00:31.699
Nine hours,
guy held out for nine hours.

00:31.732 --> 00:34.468
Well, the desk sergeant
asked me to bring this up.

00:34.502 --> 00:36.070
You want a cup of coffee?

00:36.104 --> 00:38.172
Yeah, and two eggs over easy,
some hash browns

00:38.206 --> 00:40.208
and toast.

00:40.241 --> 00:41.809
Coffee's fine.

00:43.811 --> 00:46.147
"Have you seen this child?

00:46.180 --> 00:49.183
"Missing, March 22nd, 1980.

00:49.217 --> 00:50.251
Jeffrey Ronsen."

00:52.520 --> 00:54.522
Jeffrey Ronsen?

00:54.555 --> 00:56.424
Yeah,
an old missing child flyer

00:56.457 --> 00:59.193
and a photo
of Yankee Clipper Park.

00:59.227 --> 01:01.595
Somebody wrote an "X"
in the right field corner.

01:01.629 --> 01:03.497
Look at this.

01:03.531 --> 01:05.699
"He is here."

01:10.438 --> 01:12.873
(Cragen)
Jeffrey Ronsen was seven
when he disappeared in 1980.

01:12.906 --> 01:15.309
We spent the entire spring
trying to find him.

01:15.343 --> 01:17.211
(Benson)
Wasn't there a guy
you liked for this?

01:17.245 --> 01:19.813
Yeah, Lucas Biggs.

01:19.847 --> 01:21.549
He played ball
in the Independent League.

01:21.582 --> 01:22.750
Liked to pick up little boys

01:22.783 --> 01:25.319
and take 'em home
for extra innings.

01:25.353 --> 01:26.554
The day Jeffrey disappeared,

01:26.587 --> 01:28.589
a dozen witnesses saw him
talking to Biggs.

01:28.622 --> 01:30.591
We just didn't have enough
to make a collar.

01:30.624 --> 01:32.226
I remember Biggs.

01:32.260 --> 01:33.861
He got popped for a
kidnap-murder down in Virginia.

01:33.894 --> 01:35.229
He's on death row, right?

01:35.263 --> 01:36.597
Not for long.

01:36.630 --> 01:38.399
He's slated for
execution next week.

01:38.432 --> 01:41.202
Captain, we have something.

01:41.235 --> 01:43.237
Got a hit off the ground
penetrating radar,

01:43.271 --> 01:45.306
started digging,
found this...

01:45.339 --> 01:47.241
Child's skull,
buried face down.

01:47.275 --> 01:49.577
(Benson)
He's still got on
his baseball jersey.

01:49.610 --> 01:50.711
(Cragen)
It's gotta be Jeffrey.

01:50.744 --> 01:53.614
This is his neighborhood.

01:53.647 --> 01:56.717
He played ball here.

01:56.750 --> 01:59.420
Maybe leading us to the body
was Biggs' way of getting

01:59.453 --> 02:00.921
a stay of execution.

02:00.954 --> 02:03.857
Virginia won't fry him
if our case is active again.

02:03.891 --> 02:06.860
If Biggs is behind this,
he's got help on the outside.

02:06.894 --> 02:09.397
Somebody hand-delivered
that flyer and photo.

02:09.430 --> 02:11.332
Which he coulda sent
to anybody.

02:11.365 --> 02:12.700
Why did he pick you?

03:03.851 --> 03:06.720
These are Jeffrey Ronsen's
dental records.

03:06.754 --> 03:08.589
The two cavities
and the missing baby tooth

03:08.622 --> 03:09.790
match the remains.

03:09.823 --> 03:11.425
How'd he die?

03:11.459 --> 03:12.826
Probably a broken neck.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.428
See the breaks here
in C3 and C4.

03:14.462 --> 03:15.663
[cell phone ringing]

03:15.696 --> 03:17.498
Biggs suffocated
the one boy he killed.

03:17.531 --> 03:18.999
What's up?

03:19.032 --> 03:21.001
Kid started screaming.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.736
He held a hand
over his mouth.

03:22.770 --> 03:24.738
Breaking Jeffrey's neck
doesn't fit his M.O.

03:24.772 --> 03:26.340
I did say probably.

03:26.374 --> 03:27.708
Jeffrey coulda been suffocated

03:27.741 --> 03:29.377
and the vertebrae could've
been broken postmortem

03:29.410 --> 03:30.678
when the body was dumped.

03:30.711 --> 03:32.280
I'll call the Ronsens,
let them know

03:32.313 --> 03:33.481
they'll have the remains
first thing tomorrow.

03:33.514 --> 03:34.615
(Stabler)
Captain, that was Kathy.

03:34.648 --> 03:36.384
She's at the hospital
with Dickie.

03:36.417 --> 03:37.285
They think it's appendicitis.

03:37.318 --> 03:38.619
Go.

03:38.652 --> 03:39.853
(Stabler)
I'll check in with you later.

03:39.887 --> 03:42.790
I'll set up surveillance
at the funeral,

03:42.823 --> 03:44.658
in case our tipster
decides to show.

03:44.692 --> 03:45.959
I'll call the family,

03:45.993 --> 03:48.228
make sure they don't mind
you crashing their wake.

03:50.998 --> 03:53.000
(Benson)
Mr. and Mrs. Ronsen,
I'm so sorry for your loss.

03:53.033 --> 03:54.502
Thank you, Detective.

03:54.535 --> 03:55.569
The guestbook's right here.

03:55.603 --> 03:57.037
Please sign in
before the service.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.607
Thank you.

03:59.640 --> 04:02.009
(man)
She writes her name
and the pen transmits

04:02.042 --> 04:03.711
everything she wrote
to our wireless receiver.

04:03.744 --> 04:06.280
The magic of digital pens.

04:06.314 --> 04:08.616
We just cross-reference the name
with the original case files.

04:12.686 --> 04:13.521
(Morales)
"Ronald Hooper."

04:16.857 --> 04:18.058
(Munch)
Jeffrey's maternal uncle.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.394
Lived in Seattle in 1980.

04:20.428 --> 04:23.397
Tag him "low priority."

04:23.431 --> 04:24.865
(Morales)
"Deacon Brinn."

04:24.898 --> 04:27.901
(Munch)
Lived across the street
from the Ronsens.

04:27.935 --> 04:30.371
Was babysitting Jeffrey
the night he disappeared.

04:30.404 --> 04:31.905
Let him walk home by himself.

04:31.939 --> 04:34.308
Deacon was the last person
to see Jeffrey alive.

04:34.342 --> 04:35.776
(Munch on radio)
Liv, we're gonna
have to interview Deacon

04:35.809 --> 04:36.944
as soon as the service is over.

04:36.977 --> 04:38.846
Copy that.

04:38.879 --> 04:40.681
(Morales)
I got another one.
"Avery Shaw."

04:43.684 --> 04:45.986
Played on
Jeffrey's baseball team.

04:46.019 --> 04:49.457
Week after Jeffrey disappeared,
Avery remembered seeing

04:49.490 --> 04:50.824
Biggs talking to Jeffrey.

04:50.858 --> 04:53.361
(Morales)
Hang on, what's he doing?

04:53.394 --> 04:54.428
He's leaving.

04:54.462 --> 04:56.029
I'll go talk to him.

04:58.065 --> 04:59.533
'Scuse me.

04:59.567 --> 05:01.969
Avery?

05:02.002 --> 05:03.036
Are you all right?

05:03.070 --> 05:04.938
I'm fine.

05:04.972 --> 05:06.974
Do I know you?

05:07.007 --> 05:10.043
I'm Detective Benson.
You left pretty quick.

05:10.077 --> 05:13.781
I couldn't handle
seeing all those people again.

05:13.814 --> 05:17.084
I just wanted to say
good-bye to my best friend.

05:17.117 --> 05:19.953
You played baseball
with Jeffrey Ronsen?

05:19.987 --> 05:22.890
He played short,
I played second.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.925
We got a trophy once
for turning

05:24.958 --> 05:26.794
the most double plays
in the season.

05:26.827 --> 05:29.497
I can remember
when we took that.

05:29.530 --> 05:32.065
Jeffrey yelled at Deacon for
getting his finger in the photo.

05:32.099 --> 05:33.767
Deacon Brinn?

05:33.801 --> 05:35.102
He was like our guardian.

05:35.135 --> 05:37.137
He was older,
so he'd walk us home.

05:37.170 --> 05:41.942
Made sure we looked both ways
before crossing.

05:41.975 --> 05:43.777
Do you think finding
Jeffrey's body will prove

05:43.811 --> 05:45.579
who killed him?

05:45.613 --> 05:48.882
We're looking for evidence.
We're re-interviewing everyone.

05:48.916 --> 05:50.551
Tell me about Lucas Biggs.

05:50.584 --> 05:56.457
He had this huge stash
of baseball cards.

05:56.490 --> 06:00.894
Everybody from Reggie
to Goose to Tekulve and...

06:00.928 --> 06:03.864
He didn't look like a pervert.
He was cool.

06:03.897 --> 06:05.966
So you didn't think
that he'd hurt Jeffrey?

06:05.999 --> 06:09.069
Is that why it took you
so long to go to the police

06:09.102 --> 06:13.407
and tell 'em that you
saw them together that day?

06:13.441 --> 06:15.576
Everybody was blaming
Deacon

06:15.609 --> 06:18.579
for Jeffrey's disappearance.

06:18.612 --> 06:20.981
I didn't want them to blame me.

06:21.014 --> 06:22.983
(Deacon)
Even my parents yelled at me

06:23.016 --> 06:26.554
because I was the last person
to see Jeffrey alive.

06:26.587 --> 06:28.021
I thought it was my fault.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.657
Why were you with
Jeffrey that night?

06:29.690 --> 06:31.659
I had to stay home
and babysit him,

06:31.692 --> 06:33.193
so our folks could
go out to dinner,

06:33.226 --> 06:34.762
like they did every Saturday.

06:34.795 --> 06:37.898
I was 13.
I wanted to go to parties.

06:37.931 --> 06:40.668
I was sick of missing
all the fun.

06:40.701 --> 06:43.971
So I kicked him out of our house
and told him to go home.

06:44.004 --> 06:46.106
That doesn't make what
happened to Jeffrey your fault.

06:46.139 --> 06:47.475
Tell that to the Ronsens.

06:47.508 --> 06:48.476
They haven't spoken to me

06:48.509 --> 06:49.610
or my parents since 1980.

06:49.643 --> 06:50.644
Even though
they were the ones

06:50.678 --> 06:52.946
that let that child molester
Biggs into their home.

06:52.980 --> 06:54.648
How did that happen?

06:54.682 --> 06:57.951
Biggs' girlfriend was
the Ronsens' housekeeper.

06:57.985 --> 07:00.053
That's gotta be how
he found out about Jeffrey.

07:00.087 --> 07:01.689
(Benson)
We got nothing
from the funeral.

07:01.722 --> 07:04.725
No unexpected guests.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.460
No changes
in anyone's statement.

07:06.494 --> 07:08.729
Just a lotta people
pointing the finger at Biggs.

07:08.762 --> 07:11.031
I guess it's time
to talk to the man himself.

07:11.064 --> 07:13.501
I want you on the next flight
to Virginia.

07:13.534 --> 07:15.803
You really think he's gonna talk
after all these years?

07:15.836 --> 07:16.670
Maybe to you.

07:16.704 --> 07:19.139
If he sent the map,
it's an invitation.

07:22.976 --> 07:24.678
(Biggs)
Last time a cop came here,

07:24.712 --> 07:27.080
he tried to pin the death of
a boy from Louisville on me.

07:27.114 --> 07:28.181
Where you from?

07:28.215 --> 07:31.151
New York City.

07:31.184 --> 07:35.122
You're a long way from home.

07:35.155 --> 07:38.859
You must've heard
they're gonna kill me next week.

07:38.892 --> 07:41.895
Nothing like waiting
till the last minute.

07:41.929 --> 07:45.132
You know how many
of your colleagues

07:45.165 --> 07:47.801
tried to get me to admit
that I killed Jeffrey Ronsen?

07:47.835 --> 07:50.203
Twelve.

07:50.237 --> 07:51.271
That'd make you 13.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.106
Could be your lucky number.

07:53.140 --> 07:58.045
Your girlfriend, Vivian...

07:58.078 --> 08:00.113
she used to work
for the Ronsens.

08:00.147 --> 08:05.052
Now tell me, Lucas,
is that a coincidence?

08:05.085 --> 08:07.888
It was the first time I saw him.

08:07.921 --> 08:10.824
I went to pick Viv up from work.

08:10.858 --> 08:12.993
Jeffrey was running
around naked.

08:13.026 --> 08:17.865
Screaming about having
to get in the bathtub.

08:17.898 --> 08:19.567
His hair smelled like
Mr. Bubbles.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.602
Is that why you went
to the ballpark

08:21.635 --> 08:22.736
to lure him away with you?

08:22.770 --> 08:23.604
I never lured him
anywhere.

08:23.637 --> 08:24.972
He wasn't my type.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.674
You sure?

08:26.707 --> 08:31.612
'Cause I think you went back to
the ballpark that night, Lucas.

08:31.645 --> 08:34.782
I think that you kidnapped
Jeffrey Ronsen.

08:34.815 --> 08:36.884
You molested him,
and then you murdered him.

08:41.689 --> 08:44.925
Listen to me carefully.

08:44.958 --> 08:46.894
I never touched
Jeffrey Ronsen.

08:46.927 --> 08:48.896
Then how did you know
where he was buried?

08:48.929 --> 08:50.664
What are you talking about?

08:50.698 --> 08:52.800
Why'd you send me these?

08:58.271 --> 08:59.239
[chuckling]

08:59.272 --> 09:01.341
You think it's funny?

09:01.374 --> 09:04.745
Next Friday, they're gonna
fry me like a piece of bacon.

09:04.778 --> 09:06.714
Why would I send you these now?

09:06.747 --> 09:08.148
So we'd find Jeffrey,
the case stays alive

09:08.181 --> 09:09.116
and so do you.

09:11.018 --> 09:13.320
What you don't understand,
Detective Benson,

09:13.353 --> 09:15.756
is I'm ready to die.

09:15.789 --> 09:18.225
I've made peace with my Lord.

09:18.258 --> 09:19.827
He's forgiven me my sins.

09:22.930 --> 09:26.133
And Jeffrey Ronsen
isn't one of 'em.

09:29.302 --> 09:31.271
Any luck?

09:31.304 --> 09:32.973
Biggs wouldn't give it up.

09:33.006 --> 09:35.308
So I guess he's gonna
take it to his grave.

09:35.342 --> 09:37.110
Jeffrey was seven.

09:37.144 --> 09:39.179
The boy Biggs killed
was older, right?

09:39.212 --> 09:40.347
Yeah, he was 12.

09:40.380 --> 09:42.282
So were the other kids
that Biggs molested.

09:42.315 --> 09:44.618
He likes pubescent boys
not little kids.

09:44.652 --> 09:46.987
Well, maybe Biggs never got
caught with the smaller ones.

09:47.020 --> 09:49.723
Younger the victim,
less likely they are to talk.

09:49.757 --> 09:51.725
Guess who's been drawing
on Biggs' baseball pension

09:51.759 --> 09:52.860
since he's been locked up.

09:52.893 --> 09:54.027
One Vivian Tate.

09:54.061 --> 09:55.763
Jeffrey Ronsen's
old housekeeper.

09:55.796 --> 09:57.197
Biggs' old girlfriend.

09:57.230 --> 09:59.199
She's been living off
of Biggs gravy train

09:59.232 --> 10:00.367
for the last nine years.

10:00.400 --> 10:01.769
The minute he kicks,

10:01.802 --> 10:03.236
she's back
to paying her own way.

10:03.270 --> 10:05.338
That's a good reason
to keep the ex-boyfriend alive.

10:05.372 --> 10:07.340
If Vivian knew where Biggs
buried Jeffrey,

10:07.374 --> 10:09.910
she coulda led you to the body
and Biggs woulda never known.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.812
He stays alive,
the cash keeps coming.

10:11.845 --> 10:13.180
I'll go have a chat with her.

10:17.017 --> 10:18.686
(Vivian)
Biggs can't cash
his pension check,

10:18.719 --> 10:20.320
so I do it for him

10:20.353 --> 10:23.056
and put a little spending money
in his inmate account.

10:23.090 --> 10:25.225
And then you keep
the rest for yourself.

10:25.258 --> 10:27.227
I didn't do nothing wrong.
He owes me.

10:27.260 --> 10:29.697
I lost a good job
on account of him.

10:29.730 --> 10:31.031
No one will hire me.

10:31.064 --> 10:33.100
Because your boyfriend
killed your boss' son.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.367
He didn't kill Jeffrey.

10:34.401 --> 10:35.769
Sure he did.

10:35.803 --> 10:38.338
Just like he killed
that boy in Virginia.

10:38.371 --> 10:40.908
We couldn't prove it until
you led us to Jeffrey's body.

10:40.941 --> 10:42.175
I didn't lead you anywhere.

10:42.209 --> 10:44.044
You sent me this map
to his grave.

10:44.077 --> 10:46.113
Tell me.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.647
What happened?
Guilty conscience get to you?

10:49.449 --> 10:50.918
Have it your way.

10:50.951 --> 10:52.920
Vivian Tate--
What the hell?

10:52.953 --> 10:55.188
You're under arrest
for grand larceny.

10:55.222 --> 10:57.891
I didn't steal anything.

10:57.925 --> 11:00.193
Look, most of that money
went to pay his bills.

11:00.227 --> 11:02.029
He's been in jail
for nine years.

11:02.062 --> 11:03.330
What bills could he have?

11:03.363 --> 11:06.834
Lawyers for his appeal,
his storage locker.

11:06.867 --> 11:08.035
What storage locker?

11:22.249 --> 11:25.118
(Benson)
Oh, my God.

11:25.152 --> 11:26.987
There's gotta be
100 baseball caps in here.

11:27.020 --> 11:27.955
Trophies.

11:29.823 --> 11:31.725
Each one from
a different victim.

11:46.306 --> 11:48.241
(Biggs)
You had no right
to touch those.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.146
They gave 'em to me.

11:53.180 --> 11:55.048
To remember them by.

11:55.082 --> 11:56.750
And I remember them.

11:56.784 --> 11:59.486
Their necks, their shoulders...

11:59.519 --> 12:00.854
their bellies.

12:00.888 --> 12:03.924
Always changing.

12:03.957 --> 12:05.525
Turning from boys into men

12:05.558 --> 12:07.060
right before my eyes.

12:09.462 --> 12:12.265
Shelf six, cap number three,

12:12.299 --> 12:14.367
that little kid
with the cowlick.

12:14.401 --> 12:18.839
From St. Louis.

12:18.872 --> 12:20.540
Shelf two,

12:20.573 --> 12:22.342
cap number four.

12:22.375 --> 12:25.078
Little Mexican boy
from El Paso.

12:26.413 --> 12:28.315
Huh.

12:28.348 --> 12:31.218
They were always there
waiting for me in my room.

12:33.921 --> 12:36.423
Waiting for me...

12:36.456 --> 12:37.825
till I need 'em.

12:39.326 --> 12:40.928
Tell me their names.

12:40.961 --> 12:43.196
Only if I can touch them.

12:43.230 --> 12:45.132
Take him back to his cell.

12:47.868 --> 12:49.803
You know what we do
with old evidence?

12:52.840 --> 12:53.874
We burn it.

12:53.907 --> 12:56.910
Big old incinerator.

12:56.944 --> 12:58.979
Turns all this junk
into ash in a heartbeat.

12:59.012 --> 13:00.180
That--

13:01.614 --> 13:04.818
That hat belongs
to Randy Morgan.

13:04.852 --> 13:07.020
October 17th, 1979.

13:07.054 --> 13:11.859
Macon, Georgia.

13:11.892 --> 13:13.526
I went three for four
that afternoon.

13:13.560 --> 13:16.930
Drove in two runs.

13:16.964 --> 13:19.867
This could be fun.

13:19.900 --> 13:22.802
Do you wanna go on?

13:41.922 --> 13:44.958
Shelf two, cap number three.

13:47.995 --> 13:49.329
Benny Giles.

13:49.362 --> 13:52.866
July 31st, 1984.

13:52.900 --> 13:56.436
Bethesda, Maryland.

13:56.469 --> 14:01.942
I hit a walk-off double
down the left field line.

14:06.213 --> 14:07.180
Shelf six,

14:07.214 --> 14:08.581
cap number three.

14:11.952 --> 14:13.253
Freddy Rule.

14:13.286 --> 14:16.589
June 1st, 1977.
Tampa, Florida.

14:19.592 --> 14:23.363
Larry Jones.
July 12th. Charlotte.

14:23.396 --> 14:28.268
Scott Blevins, September 29th,
Providence.

14:30.570 --> 14:36.143
Charlie Thomas.
January 10th, 1982.

14:36.176 --> 14:38.045
Marcus...

14:38.078 --> 14:39.179
Johnny...

14:39.212 --> 14:41.014
Drew...

14:41.048 --> 14:42.349
Kenny...

14:42.382 --> 14:43.350
Eli...

14:43.383 --> 14:44.351
Bobby...

14:44.384 --> 14:46.186
Jeremy...Johnny...Pete...

14:46.219 --> 14:48.555
Floyd...Joey...Neil...

14:48.588 --> 14:51.324
Patrick...Ethan...Effram...
Zeke...

14:51.358 --> 14:54.361
Alex...Daniel...Lance...
Jeremy...

14:54.394 --> 14:55.395
Eddie.

15:01.401 --> 15:04.371
Riverside Eagles.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.539
Jeffrey Ronsen.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.408
I told you,
I never touched Jeffrey.

15:08.441 --> 15:10.377
Well, then whose hat is it?

15:20.320 --> 15:23.390
March 2nd, 1980.

15:26.493 --> 15:31.598
New York City.

15:31.631 --> 15:33.000
Deacon Brinn.

15:35.768 --> 15:37.704
Deacon Brinn
was interviewed five times

15:37.737 --> 15:39.406
after Jeffrey's disappearance.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.408
He never said a word
about being molested.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.977
Not even after Richmond PD
arrested Biggs.

15:44.011 --> 15:45.745
You think Biggs
is messing with us?

15:45.778 --> 15:48.548
He had no way of knowing
that we'd already ID'd 13 hats.

15:48.581 --> 15:51.018
He gave us right names
on all of them.

15:51.051 --> 15:52.319
So where's Jeffrey's hat?

15:52.352 --> 15:54.054
Maybe he wasn't wearing one.

15:54.087 --> 15:55.688
Then tell me this, Doc.

15:55.722 --> 15:58.725
Why didn't Deacon admit to
Olivia that Biggs molested him?

15:58.758 --> 16:00.760
When you've been lying
to everyone for 25 years,

16:00.793 --> 16:02.529
the lie becomes like a cancer.

16:02.562 --> 16:04.297
It just keeps spreading
until it's outta control.

16:04.331 --> 16:05.765
By now it's bigger than he is.

16:05.798 --> 16:08.001
He lied to his friends.
He lied to his family.

16:08.035 --> 16:09.569
He's been editing himself
his whole life

16:09.602 --> 16:11.138
just to keep up the lie.

16:11.171 --> 16:12.372
That's incredibly isolating.

16:12.405 --> 16:15.008
The secret always stands between
you and the rest of the world.

16:15.042 --> 16:17.110
Seems like giving it up
would set him free.

16:17.144 --> 16:18.245
He doesn't know how.

16:18.278 --> 16:22.082
After 25 years, it's who he is.

16:22.115 --> 16:24.017
Maybe it's not.

16:24.051 --> 16:26.553
Deacon has to be the one
who sent us this photo.

16:26.586 --> 16:27.687
He and Jeffrey were friends.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.289
They were both molested
by Biggs.

16:29.322 --> 16:30.290
I mean, it just makes sense.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.758
(Cragen)
The execution is next week.

16:31.791 --> 16:35.062
Deacon can't stand
the thought of Biggs dying

16:35.095 --> 16:37.164
without confessing
to Jeffrey's murder.

16:37.197 --> 16:39.332
Deacon's been carrying
this secret for 25 years.

16:39.366 --> 16:41.101
How am I gonna get him to talk?

16:41.134 --> 16:43.670
Tell him you already know.

16:43.703 --> 16:45.172
(Benson)
You recognize this hat?

16:45.205 --> 16:46.206
(Deacon)
That's the Riverside Eagles.

16:46.239 --> 16:49.176
That was my baseball team.

16:49.209 --> 16:51.311
Where'd you get that?

16:51.344 --> 16:55.115
We found it
in Biggs' storage locker.

16:55.148 --> 17:00.187
He kept souvenirs of all
the boys that he molested.

17:00.220 --> 17:04.023
You were one of them.

17:09.096 --> 17:12.065
He gave me tips, taught me
how to hit a curveball.

17:12.099 --> 17:14.634
I couldn't believe it
when he invited me to his place.

17:14.667 --> 17:18.271
He treated me
like a grown-up.

17:18.305 --> 17:20.240
We drank beers,

17:20.273 --> 17:23.810
we watched dirty movies.

17:23.843 --> 17:28.815
Then one day he did...

17:28.848 --> 17:30.483
things to me.

17:33.820 --> 17:36.089
He kept telling me that
we weren't doing anything wrong,

17:36.123 --> 17:38.358
but I knew we were.

17:38.391 --> 17:41.794
That's why you sent me
this photo.

17:44.864 --> 17:48.535
How'd you know I sent it?

17:48.568 --> 17:51.138
You just told me.

17:54.441 --> 17:56.376
I should have told
25 years ago.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.111
So do it now.

17:58.145 --> 18:00.880
You're the victim here.

18:00.913 --> 18:04.551
Deacon, you've been swallowing
the truth all these years.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.553
It's time to stop.

18:13.193 --> 18:14.427
I went to Biggs' apartment

18:14.461 --> 18:18.431
the night that
Jeffrey disappeared.

18:18.465 --> 18:22.402
I just needed
somebody to talk to.

18:22.435 --> 18:25.172
I saw him leaving, so
I followed him to the ballpark.

18:25.205 --> 18:26.739
He was carrying a big bag.

18:31.544 --> 18:35.315
I saw him drop
Jeffrey's body in the hole.

18:35.348 --> 18:37.417
Then he saw me.

18:37.450 --> 18:40.487
And he said he'd kill me
if I told.

18:48.195 --> 18:49.162
(Mrs. Ronsen)
So you're convinced

18:49.196 --> 18:51.264
Biggs did it?

18:51.298 --> 18:53.300
(Novak)
Mr. Ronsen, we have a witness
who can help convict

18:53.333 --> 18:54.367
Lucas Biggs
of killing your son.

18:54.401 --> 18:56.403
How long would a trial take?

18:56.436 --> 18:57.804
Well, could take a year,
maybe two.

18:57.837 --> 18:59.306
That's years
of going to court,

18:59.339 --> 19:01.441
talking about what happened,
answering questions.

19:01.474 --> 19:02.609
Years Biggs gets

19:02.642 --> 19:05.778
to spend eating,
breathing, watching TV.

19:05.812 --> 19:09.716
But in the end, at least
you'll have the peace of mind

19:09.749 --> 19:12.419
that comes with knowing that
the man who killed your son

19:12.452 --> 19:14.954
will pay for what he did.

19:14.987 --> 19:18.958
We were out having a nice dinner
while that man murdered our son.

19:18.991 --> 19:21.594
Peace of mind won't be
coming anytime soon.

19:21.628 --> 19:24.831
(Mrs. Ronsen)
We just want this to be over.

19:24.864 --> 19:27.434
Don't stop the execution.

19:27.467 --> 19:28.501
[door opens]

19:28.535 --> 19:29.636
Olivia.

19:32.339 --> 19:33.540
Get your coat.

19:36.476 --> 19:37.810
Engineer called it in.

19:37.844 --> 19:39.379
He thought he saw
something go under the train.

19:39.412 --> 19:40.713
The body was cut in two.

19:47.987 --> 19:49.289
Deacon Brinn.

19:49.322 --> 19:50.590
(Munch)
That's his car over there.

19:50.623 --> 19:51.724
Drove out to middle
of nowhere
[cell phone ringing]

19:51.758 --> 19:53.493
and jumped in front
of the train.
[cell phone ringing]

19:56.629 --> 19:59.399
He wasn't ready to deal
with what Biggs did to him.

19:59.432 --> 20:01.968
He's been burying it
for so long.

20:02.001 --> 20:05.305
He sent you that note because
he wanted the truth to come out.

20:05.338 --> 20:07.874
The truth about Jeffrey.

20:07.907 --> 20:09.576
Not himself.

20:09.609 --> 20:10.910
(Munch)
That was O'Halloran.

20:10.943 --> 20:12.912
He wants us at the lab.

20:16.416 --> 20:18.285
(O'Halloran)
Warner sent over
everything she dug up

20:18.318 --> 20:19.619
with Jeffrey Ronsen's bones.

20:19.652 --> 20:21.288
The cotton clothing's
long gone,

20:21.321 --> 20:23.356
but his baseball jersey
was acrylic.

20:23.390 --> 20:24.457
It's pretty much intact.

20:24.491 --> 20:25.892
The wonders of biodegradation.

20:25.925 --> 20:28.728
But that can't be the reason
why you called us down here.

20:28.761 --> 20:30.663
This is. Found it stuck
on Jeffrey Ronsen's shirt.

20:30.697 --> 20:31.664
(Munch)
What is it?

20:31.698 --> 20:32.799
Bubble gum.

20:32.832 --> 20:34.801
So Jeffrey was chewing
gum when he died.

20:34.834 --> 20:35.968
What's the significance?

20:36.002 --> 20:39.606
Jeffrey wasn't chewing gum.
His killer was.

20:39.639 --> 20:43.376
Jeffrey was found
face down.

20:43.410 --> 20:46.446
Gum's right there on the front
of Jeffrey's shirt.

20:46.479 --> 20:47.647
So the killer spit out his gum

20:47.680 --> 20:48.981
and tossed Jeffrey's body
on top of it.

20:49.015 --> 20:50.650
Not exactly.

20:50.683 --> 20:53.052
Ever notice how kids love
to play with their gum?

20:53.085 --> 20:55.988
My ten-year-old nephew
rolls it between his fingers

20:56.022 --> 20:58.325
and smushes it
before he throws it away.

20:58.358 --> 20:59.659
So did our killer.

20:59.692 --> 21:02.429
Now run that print
through AFIS,

21:02.462 --> 21:04.931
my name would come up
in five seconds flat.

21:04.964 --> 21:06.499
So whose print
is on this gum?

21:06.533 --> 21:08.601
Deacon Brinn.

21:08.635 --> 21:10.570
Deacon killed Jeffrey Ronsen?

21:10.603 --> 21:13.740
It wasn't shame
that drove him to suicide.

21:13.773 --> 21:15.475
It was guilt.

21:15.508 --> 21:17.043
My victim is my perp.

21:23.616 --> 21:27.654
Deacon killed Jeffrey Ronsen,
and he got away with it.

21:27.687 --> 21:30.357
He had a good life,
a wife, and a kid.

21:30.390 --> 21:32.592
There's no way he sent you
a photo of Jeffrey's grave.

21:32.625 --> 21:35.362
I screwed up. I showed him
the photo and the map.

21:35.395 --> 21:37.764
He knew he had to lie about 'em,
so I wouldn't suspect

21:37.797 --> 21:38.831
he'd killed Jeffrey.

21:38.865 --> 21:40.333
But why kill his friend?

21:40.367 --> 21:41.901
He was probably
pretty close to the edge

21:41.934 --> 21:43.670
after Biggs molested him.

21:43.703 --> 21:45.772
Deacon was angry at Biggs,
but he redirected that anger

21:45.805 --> 21:48.007
towards Jeffrey,
the younger version of himself.

21:48.040 --> 21:50.109
It's called identification
with the oppressor.

21:50.142 --> 21:52.879
Did he simply kill Jeffrey
or did he molest him too?

21:52.912 --> 21:54.414
(Munch)
I'll bet he molested him.

21:54.447 --> 21:56.048
The kind of trauma
Deacon suffered

21:56.082 --> 21:58.017
can warp a victim's sexuality.

21:58.050 --> 22:00.620
So Deacon doesn't want
to be the victim anymore.

22:00.653 --> 22:01.988
He becomes the victimizer.

22:02.021 --> 22:03.723
Until someone put
a bullet in him.

22:03.756 --> 22:05.625
I thought he was killed
by a train.

22:05.658 --> 22:08.428
So did I
till I X-rayed the body.

22:08.461 --> 22:09.362
Nine millimeter slug
in his heart.

22:09.396 --> 22:10.397
I put time of death

22:10.430 --> 22:12.064
around 10:00 last night,

22:12.098 --> 22:13.733
two hours before the train
hit him.

22:15.402 --> 22:16.503
Could Deacon have
shot himself?

22:16.536 --> 22:17.770
(Warner)
No residue on his hands.

22:17.804 --> 22:19.772
Whoever killed him,
put him on the tracks

22:19.806 --> 22:21.641
to make it look like a suicide.

22:21.674 --> 22:23.910
Maybe the same person
that led me to Jeffrey's body.

22:23.943 --> 22:25.144
Talk to Deacon's wife.

22:25.177 --> 22:27.580
Find out
where he was last night.

22:27.614 --> 22:28.748
Deacon wasn't home.

22:28.781 --> 22:29.882
(Benson)
Where was he?

22:29.916 --> 22:31.017
I don't know.

22:31.050 --> 22:32.985
Zeke and I went out for pizza.

22:33.019 --> 22:36.423
And I let him play video games
until the place closed.

22:36.456 --> 22:40.126
And what time
did you get home?

22:40.159 --> 22:44.897
It was, um...
just after 10:00.

22:44.931 --> 22:48.935
Did you hear from Deacon
at all that night?

22:48.968 --> 22:51.404
I called his cell phone

22:51.438 --> 22:56.776
when we got back
from the pizza place.

22:56.809 --> 22:59.679
Zeke wouldn't go to bed without
saying good night to his dad.

22:59.712 --> 23:03.983
Was it unusual for Deacon
to be out so late?

23:04.016 --> 23:07.820
We were having problems.

23:12.492 --> 23:16.095
Julia, it's important
that you tell me.

23:18.865 --> 23:20.900
I thought
he was having an affair.

23:20.933 --> 23:22.935
Did you confront him about this?

23:22.969 --> 23:24.003
Six months ago.

23:24.036 --> 23:28.207
He said that nothing
was going on.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.877
He just had some things
he needed to figure out.

23:30.910 --> 23:33.212
He said he needed some space,
so he moved out.

23:33.245 --> 23:34.781
Where to?

23:34.814 --> 23:38.017
His old apartment.

23:38.050 --> 23:41.220
He sublet it
after we got married.

23:41.253 --> 23:44.190
When things got bad
he moved back in.

23:46.993 --> 23:48.194
(Munch)
No picture, no books.

23:48.227 --> 23:49.662
Looks like Deacon
used this place

23:49.696 --> 23:52.198
as nothing but a crash pad.

23:52.231 --> 23:55.902
Then why'd he keep
his desk locked?

23:55.935 --> 23:57.504
A bunch of mail.

23:57.537 --> 24:00.206
Some addressed here.

24:00.239 --> 24:02.041
Some addressed
to the other house.

24:02.074 --> 24:03.109
Love letters?

24:05.177 --> 24:07.046
Hate mail.

24:07.079 --> 24:10.483
"You're gonna pay
for what you did."

24:10.517 --> 24:11.651
Postmarked a month ago.

24:11.684 --> 24:13.953
"Truth time."

24:13.986 --> 24:16.022
Photo of Deacon
and his family.

24:16.055 --> 24:19.258
There's writing on the back.

24:19.291 --> 24:21.494
"Before:
the perfect American family.

24:21.528 --> 24:23.596
The after version
won't be as pretty."

24:23.630 --> 24:25.865
Deacon's stalker knew
about Jeffrey.

24:25.898 --> 24:27.867
Probably sent me
the flyer and the photo,

24:27.900 --> 24:29.569
hoping that we'd collar Deacon.

24:29.602 --> 24:30.803
Stalker knew about Biggs too.

24:30.837 --> 24:32.004
Here's a clipping
about Biggs' execution.

24:32.038 --> 24:33.039
The stalker wrote on it.

24:33.072 --> 24:35.975
"He owned you then,
I own you now."

24:36.008 --> 24:39.979
Deacon said he never told anyone
about the abuse.

24:40.012 --> 24:41.514
So who knew?

24:41.548 --> 24:43.750
Pedophiles like to share
their exploits.

24:43.783 --> 24:46.118
Maybe Biggs bragged to our
stalker about molesting Deacon.

24:48.287 --> 24:50.256
(Benson)
Somebody murdered Deacon Brinn.

24:50.289 --> 24:52.759
Somebody who knew
that you abused him.

24:52.792 --> 24:54.961
I never abused Deacon
or any of the boys.

24:54.994 --> 24:56.162
I loved them.

24:56.195 --> 24:59.699
Your love ruined their lives.

24:59.732 --> 25:00.967
I didn't do anything wrong.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.835
Come on, Lucas,
you know that's not true.

25:02.869 --> 25:04.604
What did I do wrong?

25:04.637 --> 25:06.606
I was born with these feelings.

25:06.639 --> 25:08.240
I don't know why I have them.

25:08.274 --> 25:10.109
They were always there.

25:10.142 --> 25:12.044
It wasn't exactly like
I had a choice.

25:12.078 --> 25:14.581
Neither did the 117 boys
you molested.

25:14.614 --> 25:15.615
I never hurt them.

25:18.117 --> 25:19.418
It never hurt me.

25:23.289 --> 25:25.825
You were abused.

25:42.208 --> 25:44.844
My father left
when I was a baby.

25:49.749 --> 25:51.217
And when I was about nine,

25:51.250 --> 25:53.653
this man moved across
the street.

25:58.725 --> 26:03.295
He was the only one
I could talk to.

26:03.329 --> 26:05.131
He loved me, he cared for me.

26:08.367 --> 26:10.169
And touching me
was how he showed it.

26:14.941 --> 26:15.875
I'm sorry.

26:24.751 --> 26:26.819
[crying]

26:30.990 --> 26:32.959
[crash]

26:38.731 --> 26:41.067
I never meant to hurt the boys.

26:44.103 --> 26:45.805
Lucas.

26:48.675 --> 26:51.010
Deacon Brinn is dead.

26:51.043 --> 26:53.780
And the killer knew
what you did to him.

26:53.813 --> 26:56.048
Just tell me who you told.

26:56.082 --> 26:57.183
No one.

26:57.216 --> 26:58.985
There has to be somebody.

26:59.018 --> 27:00.987
In jail, somebody
who knew you back then.

27:01.020 --> 27:03.756
Somebody who knew
about you and Deacon.

27:10.129 --> 27:11.263
There was a little boy.

27:13.766 --> 27:18.705
He used to follow
Deacon and Jeffrey around.

27:18.738 --> 27:22.208
And Deacon used
to look at him...

27:22.241 --> 27:23.843
the way I looked at boys.

27:29.816 --> 27:30.883
What was his name?

27:35.154 --> 27:36.689
Avery.

27:39.859 --> 27:40.693
His name was Avery.

27:44.964 --> 27:47.166
Go, go, go, go!

27:47.199 --> 27:48.801
Police.

27:48.835 --> 27:49.736
Avery Shaw.

27:51.804 --> 27:52.905
Bedroom's clear.

27:55.775 --> 27:56.876
(Benson)
John, in here.

28:00.346 --> 28:02.181
Photos of Deacon's prom.

28:02.214 --> 28:04.183
His college graduation.

28:04.216 --> 28:07.854
Avery's been obsessed
with Deacon for years.

28:09.388 --> 28:11.958
Look at this.

28:11.991 --> 28:13.025
Deacon's wedding announcement.

28:13.059 --> 28:14.026
(Munch)
Check this out.

28:14.060 --> 28:15.728
A map of Queens

28:15.762 --> 28:17.296
with all these
different routes marked

28:17.329 --> 28:18.765
leading to Deacon's house.

28:18.798 --> 28:21.433
Copies of Jeffrey Ronsen's
missing poster.

28:21.467 --> 28:23.202
Just like the one
he sent me.

28:23.235 --> 28:27.339
Deacon's not the only one
he's obsessed with.

28:27.373 --> 28:30.376
"Special Victim, Special Cop."

28:31.978 --> 28:34.180
(Munch)
Avery's been stalking you too.

28:39.151 --> 28:41.821
Liv, look at this.

28:41.854 --> 28:42.955
Avery's childhood diaries
from 1983

28:42.989 --> 28:44.523
when he was ten.

28:44.556 --> 28:46.893
"I wish I had superpowers
hidden inside me.

28:46.926 --> 28:49.495
"The kind that'd come out
when I need them.

28:49.528 --> 28:50.529
"Like the Hulk.

28:50.562 --> 28:53.099
"I couldn't stop Deacon.

28:53.132 --> 28:54.366
If I was the Hulk..."

28:54.400 --> 28:56.803
"I could have smashed Deacon,
pounded his head

28:56.836 --> 28:59.772
"until blood came out
and he was dead.

28:59.806 --> 29:02.408
"But I'm just me,
and I couldn't do anything

29:02.441 --> 29:04.877
for me or for Jeffrey."

29:04.911 --> 29:07.179
So Avery was there
the night Jeffrey died.

29:07.213 --> 29:10.783
According to Avery's diary,
Jeffrey and Avery

29:10.817 --> 29:12.785
were both at Deacon's house.

29:12.819 --> 29:14.854
Deacon made the boys drink
until they passed out.

29:14.887 --> 29:16.355
Then Deacon raped Avery.

29:16.388 --> 29:18.457
Jeffrey fought back
and Deacon broke his neck.

29:18.490 --> 29:20.226
Avery knew
where Jeffrey was buried

29:20.259 --> 29:21.994
because he saw it happen.

29:22.028 --> 29:24.030
Worse. He made Avery
help him dump the body

29:24.063 --> 29:25.564
and told him that
he was going to jail too

29:25.597 --> 29:27.099
because he was there.

29:27.133 --> 29:28.567
Avery's diaries end at 14.

29:28.600 --> 29:30.402
But until then,
it is all about Deacon.

29:30.436 --> 29:31.570
"I shoulda stopped him.

29:31.603 --> 29:33.405
"I can't wait till
I'm bigger than him.

29:33.439 --> 29:34.573
I wish he were dead."

29:34.606 --> 29:35.942
(Cragen)
Deacon ever rape him again?

29:35.975 --> 29:37.543
Avery avoided Deacon
in any way he could.

29:37.576 --> 29:39.311
Even talks about
killing himself.

29:39.345 --> 29:41.280
Now he's gonna spend the rest
of his life in jail for murder.

29:41.313 --> 29:42.581
If we can find him.

29:42.614 --> 29:43.950
No trace of him
since Deacon's death.

29:43.983 --> 29:45.451
Financials came in.

29:45.484 --> 29:47.419
There's no activity
on his credit cards or ATM.

29:47.453 --> 29:48.921
Well, any flights,
gas receipts, hotels?

29:48.955 --> 29:50.189
Nothing.

29:50.222 --> 29:52.591
But his bank records show
a bunch of big checks

29:52.624 --> 29:54.126
written to a woman
in Manhattan.

29:54.160 --> 29:57.897
$1000 made out to Kimber Faulk,
cashed last week.

29:57.930 --> 30:00.366
Same last month,
same the month before.

30:00.399 --> 30:01.400
Goes back at least a year.

30:01.433 --> 30:02.434
He was paying her off.

30:02.468 --> 30:04.503
Let's find out why.

30:07.874 --> 30:09.275
(Kimber)
This is Theo.

30:09.308 --> 30:11.177
Avery's son.

30:11.210 --> 30:14.280
Is that why
he's sending you money?

30:14.313 --> 30:15.381
Avery started supporting me

30:15.414 --> 30:17.349
the day I found out
I was pregnant.

30:17.383 --> 30:18.617
Same day he left.

30:18.650 --> 30:20.319
Said he couldn't handle
being a dad.

30:20.352 --> 30:22.254
Nice guy.

30:22.288 --> 30:24.456
You don't know Avery.

30:24.490 --> 30:26.592
He's the sweetest man
I've ever known.

30:26.625 --> 30:28.294
We were together for two years.

30:28.327 --> 30:30.562
And the only thing we ever
fought about was having kids.

30:30.596 --> 30:32.198
You wanted them, he didn't.

30:32.231 --> 30:35.201
At least he was honest
about it.

30:35.234 --> 30:37.569
When it came to having children,
Avery didn't just have issues.

30:37.603 --> 30:39.972
He had a subscription.

30:40.006 --> 30:42.274
Someone really screwed
him up when he was a kid.

30:42.308 --> 30:43.642
How often do you talk
to Avery?

30:43.675 --> 30:45.311
We don't talk.
He just sends money.

30:45.344 --> 30:46.378
Avery try to and borrow any?

30:46.412 --> 30:48.881
No.

30:48.915 --> 30:50.582
So this $400 you took
out of the ATM this morning,

30:50.616 --> 30:51.951
that still in your wallet?

30:51.984 --> 30:54.553
I spent it on groceries.

30:54.586 --> 30:56.288
Nothing but formula.

30:56.322 --> 30:58.224
Try again.

30:58.257 --> 31:00.092
(Benson)
You said that you never
talked to Avery.

31:00.126 --> 31:02.895
Why does your phone
show four incoming calls

31:02.929 --> 31:04.363
in the last two days?

31:04.396 --> 31:06.999
(Benson)
All from Avery.

31:07.033 --> 31:08.034
Where's he, Kimber?

31:08.067 --> 31:09.035
I don't know.

31:09.068 --> 31:10.536
Tell us where to find him,

31:10.569 --> 31:12.571
or I'll arrest you
for aiding a fugitive.

31:12.604 --> 31:14.540
What's gonna happen to Theo?

31:14.573 --> 31:16.308
Social Services
will take care of him.

31:16.342 --> 31:17.443
Detectives, let her go.
Please.

31:17.476 --> 31:19.178
She doesn't have anything
to do with this.

31:19.211 --> 31:20.279
Stay back, stand back.

31:20.312 --> 31:22.114
Don't hurt him.

31:22.148 --> 31:24.250
Put your hands on your head.

31:24.283 --> 31:27.920
Now!

31:27.954 --> 31:29.989
I never meant
for this to happen.

31:30.022 --> 31:32.424
(Benson)
Avery Shaw, you're under arrest
for the murder of Deacon Brinn.

31:32.458 --> 31:34.426
You have the right
to remain silent.

31:34.460 --> 31:36.595
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

31:36.628 --> 31:38.197
in a court of law.
I'm sorry.

31:38.230 --> 31:39.298
You have the right
to an attorney...

31:45.972 --> 31:47.974
I killed Deacon.

31:48.007 --> 31:51.610
(Benson)
Because he raped you
when you were seven.

31:51.643 --> 31:52.678
Yeah.

31:54.680 --> 31:56.983
How did you know?

31:57.016 --> 32:01.087
We searched your apartment.

32:01.120 --> 32:02.388
And I read your diaries.

32:02.421 --> 32:05.124
But, Avery, what I don't know

32:05.157 --> 32:10.129
is why you sent these to me.

32:10.162 --> 32:13.465
I thought you'd figure it out.

32:13.499 --> 32:17.036
Arrest Deacon without
involving me.

32:17.069 --> 32:18.604
And then,
you went after Biggs instead.

32:18.637 --> 32:20.672
I couldn't let Deacon
get away with it.

32:20.706 --> 32:22.308
So you shot him?

32:22.341 --> 32:25.177
Yes.

32:27.346 --> 32:29.081
You coulda gone to anybody
in this precinct

32:29.115 --> 32:31.483
with what you knew.

32:31.517 --> 32:32.584
Why me?

32:36.022 --> 32:39.158
I read about you in the papers.

32:39.191 --> 32:42.628
About how you never sleep
when you're on a case.

32:42.661 --> 32:45.531
About how your whole life
is about helping kids.

32:45.564 --> 32:50.069
Same with my partner,
same with any of my colleagues.

32:50.102 --> 32:53.672
You singled me out.

32:53.705 --> 32:56.508
You stalked me for weeks.

32:57.676 --> 32:59.345
Why?

32:59.378 --> 33:00.646
There was just something
about you.

33:00.679 --> 33:03.715
I knew you would understand.

33:03.749 --> 33:06.218
You and me,
we're so alike--
No, we're not alike.

33:06.252 --> 33:08.654
You killed a man.

33:08.687 --> 33:10.422
So have you.

33:16.062 --> 33:17.096
I didn't have a choice.

33:17.129 --> 33:18.364
Neither did I.

33:20.366 --> 33:23.802
I had to stop him
from hurting any more kids.

33:23.835 --> 33:26.338
You did it as payback
for 25 years ago.

33:26.372 --> 33:27.673
No.

33:27.706 --> 33:29.675
I went to Deacon's apartment
to confront him.

33:29.708 --> 33:32.178
And he said he was sorry
for what he did.

33:32.211 --> 33:34.246
But he was lying.

33:34.280 --> 33:35.347
He was still hurting children.

33:35.381 --> 33:36.615
How do you know that?

33:36.648 --> 33:38.050
When I went in there,

33:38.084 --> 33:41.687
he was watching a tape.

33:41.720 --> 33:44.390
And what was on the tape?

33:44.423 --> 33:45.691
Deacon.

33:45.724 --> 33:47.226
With a little boy.

33:47.259 --> 33:49.595
John, call Crime Scene.

33:49.628 --> 33:52.464
Have him meet you and Olivia
at Deacon's, find that tape.

33:52.498 --> 33:53.532
Okay.

33:53.565 --> 33:55.101
If there is one.

33:55.134 --> 33:57.369
Can you arraign Avery tonight?

33:57.403 --> 33:59.438
Why do you care?
He's a murderer.

33:59.471 --> 34:01.607
Because he's also a victim.

34:01.640 --> 34:06.445
Lights and siren,
we might make it.

34:10.149 --> 34:11.817
(woman)
Ms. Conrad,
how does your client plead?

34:11.850 --> 34:13.452
Not guilty.

34:13.485 --> 34:15.587
Guilty, Your Honor.
I did it.

34:15.621 --> 34:18.257
Mr. Shaw, please confer
with your counsel.

34:18.290 --> 34:20.126
I-I know what I'm doing.

34:20.159 --> 34:21.260
I want to plead guilty.

34:22.694 --> 34:24.130
We shoulda checked the VCR.

34:24.163 --> 34:25.564
We're looking for leads
on Deacon's murder,

34:25.597 --> 34:27.699
not America's Skankiest
Home Videos.

34:27.733 --> 34:29.301
(Benson)
Son of a bitch.

34:29.335 --> 34:31.170
Not yet, okay.

34:31.203 --> 34:34.373
Hey, why don't you come up and
sit up on the couch. Come on.

34:34.406 --> 34:35.707
It's more comfortable.
There you go.

34:35.741 --> 34:37.276
(Munch)
He filmed it right here.

34:37.309 --> 34:38.677
Where the hell's the camera?

34:38.710 --> 34:41.280
From the angle of the tape,
it's gotta be right there.

34:41.313 --> 34:42.781
The air vent.

34:42.814 --> 34:44.750
(Deacon)
What do they call it?
Dog fights.

34:44.783 --> 34:46.885
Airplane goes--[whirling noise].

34:46.918 --> 34:50.322
[Deacon laughing]

34:50.356 --> 34:52.124
(Deacon)
Yeah, I think this one...

34:52.158 --> 34:56.295
Okay, we got
a fiber optic camera here.

34:56.328 --> 34:58.564
Connected to a DV recorder

34:58.597 --> 35:00.532
and a motion detector.

35:00.566 --> 35:03.502
Starts recording
whenever the sensor's tripped.

35:03.535 --> 35:06.405
I'd say when someone
walks past the sofa.

35:06.438 --> 35:07.806
And the recorder's wired
to the TV.

35:07.839 --> 35:10.209
Is there a tape in there?
Yup.

35:10.242 --> 35:12.278
Let's see who's Deacon's
last victim was.

35:15.381 --> 35:16.648
What the hell are you doing?

35:16.682 --> 35:18.584
Something I shoulda done
a long time ago.

35:18.617 --> 35:19.818
Don't, don't, don't,
please!

35:19.851 --> 35:23.755
I went to Deacon Brinn's
apartment last week

35:23.789 --> 35:26.192
to see if he was still
the monster I remembered.

35:26.225 --> 35:26.925
(Avery)
You molest your son

35:26.958 --> 35:28.727
like that little boy?

35:28.760 --> 35:30.662
No. No, no.

35:30.696 --> 35:33.165
I would never do that
to my son. I love him.

35:33.199 --> 35:33.999
Like you loved me?

35:34.032 --> 35:36.835
Wait, wait, please,
just hear me out.

35:36.868 --> 35:37.903
All right?

35:37.936 --> 35:41.407
Avery, I never meant
to hurt you.

35:41.440 --> 35:43.675
You gotta believe me.
Look, I did love you.

35:43.709 --> 35:49.515
He kept lying, pretending
like he gave a damn about me.

35:49.548 --> 35:51.650
Just like he did 25 years ago.

35:51.683 --> 35:52.851
Shut up!

35:52.884 --> 35:55.187
I don't want to hear that!

35:55.221 --> 35:56.922
Just tell me why you did it.

35:56.955 --> 35:58.690
'Cause I was so pissed off
at the world

35:58.724 --> 35:59.625
after what Biggs did to me.

35:59.658 --> 36:05.464
He said he raped me
because he was confused,

36:05.497 --> 36:07.633
messed up by the pervert
who molested him.

36:07.666 --> 36:09.435
(Deacon)
Avery, I was drinking
all the time,

36:09.468 --> 36:11.837
I couldn't--
I couldn't tell my parents.

36:11.870 --> 36:14.506
I hurt so bad.

36:14.540 --> 36:17.909
And I just wanted someone else
to hurt as bad as I did.

36:17.943 --> 36:19.645
Why'd you choose me?

36:19.678 --> 36:21.513
You needed a friend.

36:21.547 --> 36:24.350
And I knew you'd never
tell anyone.

36:24.383 --> 36:27.486
And I ask him
how many other boys

36:27.519 --> 36:31.957
he'd abused over the years.

36:31.990 --> 36:34.893
And he said dozens,
maybe hundreds.

36:34.926 --> 36:39.465
Look. You wanna kill me now,
I understand.

36:39.498 --> 36:43.302
But it's just not in you.

36:43.335 --> 36:45.971
It's not who you are.
You can't hurt anybody.

36:46.004 --> 36:47.639
You just can't do it.

36:47.673 --> 36:50.809
And I wanted to kill him
right then and there.

36:50.842 --> 36:53.779
But I knew I couldn't do it
in the apartment,

36:53.812 --> 36:58.784
so I forced him downstairs
into his car.

36:58.817 --> 37:02.688
And I made him drive
to the train tracks.

37:02.721 --> 37:03.722
And I shot him.

37:12.464 --> 37:14.966
Avery didn't shoot Deacon.

37:15.000 --> 37:18.870
[sobbing]

37:18.904 --> 37:20.672
Fast-forward it.

37:23.008 --> 37:24.476
(Benson)
Hold on, stop, stop, stop.

37:24.510 --> 37:26.445
[cell phone ringing]

37:26.478 --> 37:27.879
Hello?

37:27.913 --> 37:30.282
Don't do anything.
I'll be right there.

37:33.852 --> 37:35.053
(Munch)
Where's he going
with that gun?

37:35.086 --> 37:36.455
(O'Halloran)
We dumped the phones.

37:36.488 --> 37:37.789
Only call Deacon
got that night--

37:37.823 --> 37:38.757
(Benson)
Was from his wife.

37:38.790 --> 37:41.660
Julia.

37:44.330 --> 37:45.931
I thought you already
arrested Deacon's killer.

37:45.964 --> 37:48.334
We arrested Avery Shaw.

37:48.367 --> 37:49.668
But he didn't kill
your husband.

37:49.701 --> 37:51.403
Then why did he confess?

37:51.437 --> 37:54.473
He felt guilty for not stopping
Deacon when he had the chance.

37:54.506 --> 37:57.443
All those years of Avery
keeping silent,

37:57.476 --> 37:58.777
Deacon was molesting
other boys.

37:58.810 --> 38:00.912
We found tapes that
he made in his apartment.

38:00.946 --> 38:02.781
Dozens of victims.

38:02.814 --> 38:05.451
I had no idea.

38:08.420 --> 38:09.388
Yes, you did.

38:09.421 --> 38:10.722
This is one of the tapes

38:10.756 --> 38:12.424
that we found.

38:15.827 --> 38:17.062
It's of your son.

38:25.404 --> 38:28.540
I thought there was something
wrong with me.

38:28.574 --> 38:30.476
Deacon wouldn't touch me.

38:34.446 --> 38:36.448
When I found out
that Biggs had molested him,

38:36.482 --> 38:38.484
suddenly it made sense.

38:38.517 --> 38:41.019
And you thought about Zeke.

38:41.052 --> 38:43.755
Zeke loves his dad so much.

38:43.789 --> 38:46.392
And Deacon loved him.

38:46.425 --> 38:48.960
I didn't want to ask,
but I knew that I had to.

38:48.994 --> 38:51.397
When?

38:51.430 --> 38:54.132
At the pizza parlor.

38:54.165 --> 39:01.507
I asked Zeke if daddy
had ever touched him.

39:01.540 --> 39:04.743
He started to cry.
He said he promised not to tell.

39:04.776 --> 39:07.713
So you went home.

39:07.746 --> 39:09.114
You called Deacon.

39:09.147 --> 39:11.450
I told him I was going
to the police.

39:11.483 --> 39:12.551
He said to wait,

39:12.584 --> 39:14.653
that he was coming over.

39:14.686 --> 39:16.655
When he came in, he had a gun.

39:16.688 --> 39:19.425
He threatened to kill me.

39:19.458 --> 39:21.793
Zeke woke up, started crying.

39:21.827 --> 39:25.531
Deacon got distracted.
I grabbed the gun.

39:25.564 --> 39:29.668
I told him I would shoot him
if he came near Zeke.

39:29.701 --> 39:32.137
He said that he was going
to move away.

39:32.170 --> 39:35.674
That he wouldn't bother us
anymore.

39:35.707 --> 39:38.143
He walked out.

39:38.176 --> 39:42.013
I followed him to his car.

39:42.047 --> 39:45.050
I was thinking about
what he did to Zeke.

39:45.083 --> 39:48.720
And I couldn't help myself.

39:48.754 --> 39:51.923
I forced him to drive
to the train tracks.

39:51.957 --> 39:52.991
Then I shot him.

39:56.194 --> 39:58.196
(Avery)
She doesn't deserve
to go to jail.

39:58.229 --> 40:02.200
I should have killed Deacon.

40:02.233 --> 40:04.803
I started all this.
I should have finished it.

40:04.836 --> 40:06.004
Why now?

40:06.037 --> 40:07.839
After all these years,

40:07.873 --> 40:10.676
what made you want
to end it now?

40:10.709 --> 40:14.880
Kimber got pregnant,
and I got scared.

40:18.517 --> 40:20.051
I didn't want to hurt the baby.

40:20.085 --> 40:23.221
Hurt the baby how?

40:23.254 --> 40:27.693
Have you ever been afraid
of what might be inside you?

40:31.129 --> 40:33.098
What do you mean?

40:33.131 --> 40:34.966
I can't help thinking

40:35.000 --> 40:40.739
there's like a switch
inside of me,

40:40.772 --> 40:42.974
waiting to be flipped.

40:43.008 --> 40:46.144
Just like it did in Deacon.

40:46.177 --> 40:48.580
And I'd start hurting kids.

40:48.614 --> 40:51.249
And that's why I left
my son.

40:51.282 --> 40:53.619
You're not a monster, Avery.

40:53.652 --> 40:55.854
How do you know?

40:55.887 --> 40:57.923
Because you didn't shoot Deacon.

41:01.026 --> 41:02.828
Because you love
your son so much

41:02.861 --> 41:05.063
that you were willing
to give him up to protect him.

41:05.096 --> 41:07.999
And the truth is...

41:08.033 --> 41:09.200
you didn't have to.

41:32.057 --> 41:33.659
Go to Daddy.

41:33.692 --> 41:35.961
There you go.

41:35.994 --> 41:36.862
Go to Daddy.

41:47.706 --> 41:49.708
You hear about Biggs?

41:49.741 --> 41:52.010
Prison doc declared him dead
12:01 A.M.

41:52.043 --> 41:53.612
No last words.

41:53.645 --> 41:55.213
I guess he'd left
enough of a legacy.

41:55.246 --> 41:56.281
Yeah.

41:56.314 --> 41:57.315
How's Dickie?

41:57.348 --> 41:58.717
A handful.

41:58.750 --> 42:00.251
He's demanding
cookie dough ice cream

42:00.285 --> 42:02.988
and Jacka 24/7.

42:03.021 --> 42:05.156
Reminds me so much of me,
it's scary.

42:05.190 --> 42:07.325
Didn't know
you were a Jackass fan.

42:07.358 --> 42:09.895
I meant, getting what I want.

42:09.928 --> 42:11.597
According to Kathy,

42:11.630 --> 42:13.298
it's not one of my more
endearing qualities.

42:18.737 --> 42:22.908
Before you had kids, you ever
worry what they'd be like?

42:22.941 --> 42:24.843
All the time, I still do.

42:24.876 --> 42:26.177
At least you and Kathy

42:26.211 --> 42:28.714
know what you're passing on.

42:28.747 --> 42:30.015
Half my genes are drunk

42:30.048 --> 42:32.818
and the other half
are violent and cruel.

42:32.851 --> 42:35.621
Look how great
you turned out.

42:35.654 --> 42:37.022
It's not all
about the genes, Liv.

42:40.125 --> 42:41.927
All you can do
is love your kids.

42:48.734 --> 42:49.968
Good night.

43:18.396 --> 43:21.032
[wolf howling]
