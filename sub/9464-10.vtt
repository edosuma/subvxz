-You don't get it.
I was born to fence.

I was an outsider.

that feels like.

I just left.

to feel that way.

[Lisa coughing]: Help, Robert.
-[Robert]: You son of a bitch!

That's my sandwich! This is
the fourth time this week.

20:28.208 --> 20:30.250
I put it on the second shelf.
You know it's mine.

20:30.291 --> 20:33.417
Bobbi, I would have expected.
I had no idea that you
would do such a thing, Paul.

20:33.458 --> 20:35.667
-It's just a sandwich!
It's a sandwich.

20:35.709 --> 20:37.875
-What do you mean?
It's just a sandwich.

20:37.917 --> 20:40.083
You know what this represents?
-What?

I worked really hard on this
last night and this is the

20:42.041 --> 20:44.625
fourth time this week you've
done this. I thought you were
my friend.

20:44.667 --> 20:47.417
-But, how's this gonna taste
though? What did you put
on this one?

20:47.458 --> 20:49.792
-[Lisa coughs]
-It's watercress with the crusts
cut off.

20:49.834 --> 20:52.375
Now I can't eat it with your
DNA all over it.
It's watercress.

-Look what he did!

20:55.834 --> 20:58.458
