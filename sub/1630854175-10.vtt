WEBVTT

00:01.088 --> 00:03.307
<i>Previously on "The Rookie: Feds"...</i>

00:03.307 --> 00:05.614
This stays between us,
do you understand?

00:05.614 --> 00:07.529
I had a stent put in my heart
last month.

00:07.529 --> 00:09.835
Doctors want me to have
a double bypass at some point.

00:09.835 --> 00:10.880
I've got it under control.

00:10.880 --> 00:12.534
You doing okay, boss?

00:12.534 --> 00:13.622
Yeah.

00:13.622 --> 00:14.623
I'm just tired.

00:22.326 --> 00:24.111
Pulse rate is bradycardic.

00:24.111 --> 00:27.331
I want a CBC PT/PTT
and an ultrasound.

00:29.246 --> 00:30.769
We're losing him.

00:35.948 --> 00:37.341
<i>How's he doing?</i>

00:37.341 --> 00:39.039
They just rushed him in
for an emergency surgery.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.301
I thought he was stable.

00:40.301 --> 00:41.824
They replaced the collapsed
stent in his heart,

00:41.824 --> 00:43.652
and everything was fine.

00:43.739 --> 00:45.219
Yeah. Then this morning,
his blood pressure bottomed out,

00:45.306 --> 00:46.655
and they found a clot
in his lung.

00:46.655 --> 00:48.309
Okay.
I'm gonna head your way.

00:48.309 --> 00:49.962
No.
No, no, no, no.

00:49.962 --> 00:51.703
I'm already juggling
15 emotional cousins,

00:51.703 --> 00:53.923
four worried aunts,
and my hysterical mother.

00:54.010 --> 00:55.577
Do not need more company.

00:55.577 --> 00:58.058
Hey.
He's gonna be fine.

00:58.058 --> 01:01.496
Yeah. I gotta go.

01:04.368 --> 01:07.154
Garza's going back
into surgery.

01:07.154 --> 01:08.590
W-- Oh, my God.
What happened?

01:08.590 --> 01:11.158
I think it's complications
from removing the old stent.

01:11.158 --> 01:13.247
I didn't know
about the first stent.

01:13.247 --> 01:15.379
That's not really something
he should have kept secret.

01:15.379 --> 01:16.815
I saw him the other day,
and he didn't look good,

01:16.815 --> 01:18.600
and I let it slide.

01:18.687 --> 01:20.254
You know, my son has
a heart condition

01:20.254 --> 01:22.995
he rarely
tells anyone about.

01:22.995 --> 01:25.215
He just doesn't like it
when they treat him
like he's breakable.

01:25.215 --> 01:27.783
Alright! With Garza
still in the hospital,

01:27.783 --> 01:29.654
Carter is acting agent
in charge

01:29.654 --> 01:32.004
of the Special Investigative
Unit and this task force.

01:32.004 --> 01:33.789
Some time in the past
three to six weeks--

01:33.789 --> 01:35.051
we're still not sure yet--

01:35.138 --> 01:37.271
there was a breach
of the FBI's mainframe,

01:37.271 --> 01:39.055
and a hacker got away
with a list

01:39.055 --> 01:41.188
of our undercover agents
currently in the field.

01:41.188 --> 01:43.407
Now, we're talking
cover identities,

01:43.407 --> 01:45.366
operations-- everything.

01:45.366 --> 01:47.933
Meet Amy Wright,
our target.

01:47.933 --> 01:49.674
She's part of a heist crew

01:49.674 --> 01:52.242
that was hired to break
into a safe-deposit box

01:52.242 --> 01:54.375
where the stolen undercover list
was hidden.

01:54.375 --> 01:56.028
Nolan, you have
further information?

01:56.028 --> 01:57.595
Just that Amy is
the only remaining member

01:57.595 --> 01:59.249
of the heist crew
that is still at large.

01:59.249 --> 02:00.555
She is the one
with the undercover list.

02:00.555 --> 02:01.860
So we gotta
find Miss Thing

02:01.860 --> 02:04.211
before she hands off that list
to whomever hired her.

02:04.211 --> 02:06.126
Right.
And a word of warning.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.649
This suspect has
already murdered

02:07.649 --> 02:09.433
one of her
robbery partners,

02:09.433 --> 02:11.653
so she should be considered
armed and extremely dangerous.

02:11.740 --> 02:13.394
Our UC list
is in the open, people.

02:13.394 --> 02:15.657
The lives of hundreds
of undercover agents

02:15.744 --> 02:17.049
are depending on us.

02:17.049 --> 02:19.269
Hey. Uh, we just intercepted
an encrypted DM

02:19.269 --> 02:20.618
from Amy's
ClipTalk account.

02:20.618 --> 02:22.054
The guy who's smuggling her
across the border

02:22.054 --> 02:23.795
said he's gonna pick her up
at a closed-down dry cleaner

02:23.795 --> 02:24.709

04:23.524 --> 04:25.003
I'm just waiting

04:25.003 --> 04:28.180
Hey! Hey. Some bank robber
was getting chased by the cops

04:28.180 --> 04:30.879
and got demolished by a pickup.
Cash everywhere.

04:30.879 --> 04:32.533

04:32.533 --> 04:34.361

04:39.017 --> 04:42.325
Hey, Antoinette.
Looking lovely, as always.

04:42.325 --> 04:44.153
Must be nice
to get out of the lab, huh?

04:44.240 --> 04:45.981
Not really.

04:45.981 --> 04:48.505
A person died.

04:48.505 --> 04:50.159
Yeah. No. I know.
I know.

04:50.159 --> 04:51.726
Antoinette, you good?

04:51.726 --> 04:53.510
My team's all set. Thanks.

04:54.903 --> 04:56.687
You got anything?

04:56.687 --> 04:58.036
Uh, her backpack.
Found it at the cleaner's.

04:58.036 --> 04:59.734
But there is no
undercover list inside.

04:59.734 --> 05:02.606
Which explains why Amy had
a duffel bag full of cash.

05:02.606 --> 05:04.521
She got paid for the list.

05:04.521 --> 05:06.175
You know,
one of her heist crew

05:06.175 --> 05:07.655
is still at
Saint Stephen's Hospital.

05:07.655 --> 05:09.004
He broke his arm,
has some nerve damage,

05:09.004 --> 05:10.310
so they're hanging on to him
for a few days.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.746
R-Roger Armistead.

05:11.746 --> 05:14.270
He gave up his accomplices
in exchange for a deal.

05:14.357 --> 05:15.402
It's possible
he knows more.

05:15.489 --> 05:17.055
Laura and Brendon,
see what you can find

05:17.055 --> 05:18.405
on who hired them,
where the hand-off

05:18.405 --> 05:19.710
was supposed to take place--
anything.

05:19.710 --> 05:21.843
- Yeah. We're on it.
- Got it. Thanks.

05:21.843 --> 05:23.279
Unless you need me
for anything else,

05:23.279 --> 05:24.411
I should be getting
back to patrol.

05:24.411 --> 05:26.282
- Great.
- Uh, walk me to my shop?

05:26.282 --> 05:27.283
Yeah.
Excellent.

05:29.851 --> 05:31.809
Told you.

05:31.809 --> 05:32.984
Told me what?

05:32.984 --> 05:35.857
That you would make
a great FBI agent.

05:35.857 --> 05:38.294
You always believed
in me.

05:38.294 --> 05:39.948
You might have been
the only one.

05:39.948 --> 05:42.124
I should make you dinner.
That is the least I could do.

05:43.517 --> 05:46.041
Oh, and I wanted to get
some advice from you.

05:46.041 --> 05:49.871
I'm going crazy
staying with my dad.

05:49.871 --> 05:51.525
Oh. Yeah. No.
I get it.

05:51.525 --> 05:53.527
My first six months
here in Los Angeles,

05:53.614 --> 05:56.443
I spent living in
my college roommate's pool house

05:56.443 --> 05:57.661
before I could buy
my own place.

05:57.748 --> 06:00.664
Buying is definitely not
an option right now,

06:00.664 --> 06:05.190
but my dad does have a garage
that he's not really using.

06:05.190 --> 06:07.279
I was wondering
if you knew someone

06:07.279 --> 06:09.020
who might be able
to convert it for me.

06:09.020 --> 06:10.761
I do. Me.

06:10.848 --> 06:12.589
If you want, I can come by,
give you a rough estimate.

06:12.589 --> 06:16.637
What?
Handsome <i>and</i> handy?

06:16.637 --> 06:20.292
If you were not dating
that cute little firefighter,

06:20.292 --> 06:21.903
I might let you date me.

06:21.990 --> 06:24.558
I might let you let me.

06:24.645 --> 06:27.909
Wait. Does that make sense?
If I let you...

06:27.909 --> 06:30.346
I'll see you later. Okay.

06:30.346 --> 06:32.261
I need your honest
opinion about something.

06:32.348 --> 06:34.785
About what?
Me and Antoinette.

06:34.872 --> 06:37.701
Ah. Well, that implies that
there <i>is</i> a you and Antoinette.

06:37.701 --> 06:39.137
Yeah. Well, we've been on
three coffee dates.

06:39.224 --> 06:40.922
But that's it-- coffee.

06:40.922 --> 06:42.793
Wait. Do you not know how to
ask someone out on a date?

06:42.880 --> 06:44.708
Of course I do. I just-- I've
been famous for a long time.

06:44.795 --> 06:46.406
Oh, here we go.
No. I just--

06:46.406 --> 06:47.581
Since I started dating,

06:47.581 --> 06:49.583
people always wanted to date me,
you know?

06:49.670 --> 06:51.280
Celebrity's
a real social lubricant.

06:51.280 --> 06:53.064
Okay.
Never say that again.

06:53.064 --> 06:54.588
The point is
Antoinette doesn't care about

06:54.588 --> 06:56.633
what TV shows
or movies I've done.

06:56.633 --> 06:58.592
And I kind of like her,
you know?

06:58.592 --> 06:59.897
Well, you're not
a celebrity now, so...

07:01.333 --> 07:03.248
So I should just act like
a normal person and ask her out.

07:03.248 --> 07:04.380
Yeah. It feels like
we didn't need

07:04.467 --> 07:05.642
a whole conversation
to get here.

07:07.296 --> 07:09.472
Hey, Elena.

07:09.472 --> 07:11.692
Is he out of surgery?

07:11.692 --> 07:14.129
We just got him back
from recovery.

07:14.129 --> 07:15.696
Doctor said it went well.

07:15.696 --> 07:18.655
But till he wakes up...

07:21.876 --> 07:23.965
Didn't I tell you not to come?

07:24.052 --> 07:27.359
Well, we have to interview
a subject down the hall, so...

07:27.359 --> 07:30.537
Well, do that,
because when <i>Tío</i> opens his eyes,

07:30.537 --> 07:32.495
we don't want him
thinking about work.

07:32.495 --> 07:34.671
Okay.
See ya.

07:34.758 --> 07:36.543
Hey.

07:39.154 --> 07:40.938
We're here to see
the prisoner.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.987
Mr. Armistead, FBI.

07:45.987 --> 07:48.424
I'm Special Agent Stensen.
This is Special Agent Acres.

07:48.511 --> 07:50.382
Hey.
I already talked to the cops.

07:50.382 --> 07:52.428
Oh. Well, now your crimes
are federal,

07:52.428 --> 07:53.908
so you get to talk
to us.

07:53.908 --> 07:54.952
Mm-hmm.

07:54.952 --> 07:56.780
Later.
Game just got good,

07:56.780 --> 07:58.129
and my pain meds
are about to kick in.

07:58.129 --> 08:00.958
Oh. Nice.

08:00.958 --> 08:02.482
Not cool, bro.

08:02.482 --> 08:05.354
Here's what we know... bro.

08:05.354 --> 08:07.878
You and your crew
broke into a bank

08:07.878 --> 08:10.141
and stole a list of
FBI undercover agents.

08:10.141 --> 08:12.187
And here's what
you don't know.

08:12.187 --> 08:14.755
Your partner, Amy,

08:14.755 --> 08:16.887
she straight-up murdered
your friend Todd,

08:16.887 --> 08:18.541
and she'd probably
do the same thing to you

08:18.541 --> 08:20.630
if you weren't stuck in here, so...

08:20.630 --> 08:22.806
- You're lying.
- No, he's not lying.

08:22.806 --> 08:24.678
If you want us
to plug the TV back in,

08:24.678 --> 08:26.462
we can show you
the news reports.

08:26.462 --> 08:27.681
Well, that's on Amy,
not me.

08:27.681 --> 08:30.031
Wrong. No.
You helped steal the list,

08:30.031 --> 08:32.207
so if anyone gets killed
because of its release,

08:32.207 --> 08:33.556
then you're an accessory
to murder.

08:33.556 --> 08:35.906
Wrong.
I got a deal already.

08:35.906 --> 08:37.255
Mm. With LAPD.

08:37.255 --> 08:38.692
LAPD. Right.

08:38.692 --> 08:39.780
Not us.

08:39.780 --> 08:41.346
And like I said
in my thesis statement,

08:41.346 --> 08:43.131
your crimes
are now federal.

08:43.131 --> 08:45.568
Wait. What?
How is that fair?

08:45.568 --> 08:46.787
I know. I know.

08:46.787 --> 08:48.353
It's just so hard
to be a criminal these days.

08:48.353 --> 08:50.399
Now, who hired you?
Who has the list?

08:50.486 --> 08:52.140
I don't know who he is.

08:52.140 --> 08:54.534
All Amy said is that he's
a do-not-pass-go kind of guy.

08:54.534 --> 08:55.839
Hmm?

08:55.926 --> 08:57.406
Meaning if you screw him,

08:57.406 --> 08:58.929
you end up dead,
not collecting.

08:58.929 --> 09:00.844
Yeah. See,
that's not gonna be enough

09:00.844 --> 09:03.281
for us to give you a deal, unfortunately.

09:05.370 --> 09:07.808
Amy said the list exchange was
supposed to happen last night.

09:07.808 --> 09:09.070
Where?

09:09.157 --> 09:11.289
Some warehouse downtown
by the train tracks.

09:11.376 --> 09:13.770
She was all nervous about it
being in an isolated location

09:13.770 --> 09:14.858
because she didn't know

09:14.945 --> 09:16.338
if she was gonna
get double-crossed or not.

09:17.513 --> 09:19.080
We know what kind
of car she was driving,

09:19.080 --> 09:20.734
so let's just scrub
the traffic cams

09:20.734 --> 09:22.126
and see if we can
narrow down our search.

09:22.126 --> 09:23.345
Mm.

09:23.345 --> 09:24.781
We'll be in touch.

09:26.522 --> 09:28.219
W-Will you plug the TV
back in?

09:34.530 --> 09:36.445
The people we're dealing with
are likely long gone,

09:36.445 --> 09:37.315
but still be vigilant.

09:37.315 --> 09:39.013
You just never know.

09:46.107 --> 09:47.325
Clear.

09:47.325 --> 09:49.240
There's nothing here.

09:52.026 --> 09:53.375
Except that.

09:55.116 --> 09:57.074
Someone's watching us.

09:57.074 --> 09:59.642
<i>You think any chance
we could trace the signal?</i>

09:59.642 --> 10:01.209
Chances are
it's encrypted.

10:11.741 --> 10:12.829
You think
I should answer it?

10:12.916 --> 10:15.179
Here.

10:17.573 --> 10:18.661
Hello?

10:18.661 --> 10:20.707
What took you so long?

10:20.707 --> 10:22.099
I was getting so bored
waiting for you

10:22.099 --> 10:24.101
to follow all of
my bread crumbs.

10:24.101 --> 10:25.886
<i>This is Special Agent
Simone Clark.</i>

10:25.886 --> 10:27.061
<i>Who are you?</i>

10:27.061 --> 10:30.934
Wrong question.
Who are <i>they?</i>

10:31.021 --> 10:33.284
The undercover agents
on the list.

10:33.371 --> 10:35.069
Not just their names.

10:35.069 --> 10:36.723
Their operations.

10:36.723 --> 10:38.376
The groups
they've infiltrated.

10:38.463 --> 10:41.510
One phone call from me,
and bodies start dropping.

10:41.510 --> 10:44.774
Okay.
You obviously have some demands.

10:44.774 --> 10:47.603
<i>No. Just one.
I'm not greedy.</i>

10:47.603 --> 10:50.562
Release
prisoner number 43602

10:50.562 --> 10:53.827
from your Federal Correctional
Institution in Terminal Island

10:53.914 --> 10:56.699
or I will release the real name
of one of your undercover agents

10:56.699 --> 10:58.919
every day at 10:00 a.m.
starting today.

10:58.919 --> 11:00.964
It's a little
after 10:00 now.

11:00.964 --> 11:04.620
Yes. But... as I said,
I was growing impatient,

11:04.620 --> 11:06.622
so I released one already.

11:06.622 --> 11:08.929
<i>Sent a text to someone
who wasn't too pleased to learn</i>

11:08.929 --> 11:11.279
that there's an FBI agent
in their midst.

11:11.279 --> 11:13.324
Give us the name.

11:13.324 --> 11:15.065
<i>Now where's the fun
in that?</i>

11:15.065 --> 11:16.850
Once you find their body,

11:16.850 --> 11:19.113
you'll understand
how serious I am.

11:19.113 --> 11:22.551
Alright. Uh,
we want to work with you,

11:22.551 --> 11:24.814
but you gotta
give to get.

11:24.814 --> 11:27.512
<i>Tell us the name of the
undercover agent you exposed,</i>

11:27.512 --> 11:29.863
<i>and... then let's talk.</i>

11:31.081 --> 11:33.823
Prisoner 43602.

11:33.823 --> 11:36.957
Release him or get used
to burying your dead.

11:49.099 --> 11:50.622
Who the hell is he?

11:50.622 --> 11:52.015
No idea.
Five weeks ago,

11:52.102 --> 11:54.931
prisoner 43602 walked
into a federal courthouse,

11:54.931 --> 11:56.977
punched out
a random bailiff,

11:56.977 --> 11:58.979
then he got on his knees
and put his hands over his head.

11:58.979 --> 12:01.024
Oh.
He wanted to get arrested.

12:01.024 --> 12:02.591
Yeah, but neither
his fingerprints

12:02.678 --> 12:04.767
nor his DNA
are in the system.

12:04.767 --> 12:06.682
He came in
as a John Doe.

12:06.682 --> 12:09.554
The only identifying thing
about him are those tattoos,

12:09.554 --> 12:12.035
which appear to be
of Colombian origin.

12:12.035 --> 12:13.254
What's he got to say
for himself?

12:13.254 --> 12:14.472
Not a damn thing.

12:14.472 --> 12:17.780
Hasn't spoken one word
since he's been in custody.

12:17.780 --> 12:18.955
Cyber Unit determined
which list

12:18.955 --> 12:21.044
the hackers initially stole
off our database.

12:21.044 --> 12:23.177
There are over 1,800
FBI undercovers

12:23.177 --> 12:25.135
operating nationwide,
but we got lucky.

12:25.135 --> 12:27.616
There's only 214 names
on the sub-list that was hacked.

12:27.616 --> 12:29.400
All in
the Western territory.

12:29.400 --> 12:30.837
We got to take those agents
out of the field.

12:30.837 --> 12:33.491
No. It's not that simple.
Undercovers aren't planets.

12:33.491 --> 12:34.492
They're suns.

12:34.579 --> 12:36.668
Any abrupt extraction
would endanger

12:36.668 --> 12:37.931
everyone in their orbit--

12:38.018 --> 12:40.890
who they vouched for,
whoever vouched for them.

12:40.890 --> 12:43.023
They're all as good as dead as
soon as an undercover is made.

12:43.023 --> 12:45.721
Well, the buffet's
open tomorrow night.

12:45.721 --> 12:47.592
We're bagging pills,
snort, and smoke.

12:47.592 --> 12:48.898
Just got the word
from my new source.

12:48.898 --> 12:51.031
What? You're gonna trust
a new source?

12:51.031 --> 12:52.859
Talk about dog-crap ideas.

12:52.946 --> 12:54.730
No one asked you!

12:54.730 --> 12:56.166
Hey.

12:56.166 --> 12:57.820
Back off.

12:57.820 --> 12:59.735
A Handler will send
a coded warning

12:59.822 --> 13:01.693
if there's a risk of exposure--
something benign

13:01.693 --> 13:03.521
that only the Handler
and an undercover knows.

13:08.875 --> 13:11.703
But undercovers
work cases for months,
sometimes years,

13:11.703 --> 13:13.967
investing countless hours,
building relationships,

13:13.967 --> 13:15.882
finding sources,
gaining trust.

13:15.882 --> 13:17.535
So it's gonna take
more than just one warning

13:17.622 --> 13:19.755
to convince an undercover
to end an op.

13:19.755 --> 13:22.236
They'll want confirmation that
everyone left behind is safe.

13:22.236 --> 13:23.672
So you're telling me
if you were undercover

13:23.672 --> 13:25.239
and you thought you were
exposed, you'd just ignore it?

13:25.239 --> 13:27.676
Until I got everyone
in my orbit out safe, yeah.

13:27.676 --> 13:30.548
And most undercovers will risk
their lives to do the same.

13:30.548 --> 13:33.725
And, Laura, Brendon, mobilize
agents to start alerting UCEs.

13:33.725 --> 13:36.990
Carter, Simone, find out who the
hell our mystery prisoner is.

13:37.077 --> 13:39.557
Hey, look.
I know you're the boss now.

13:39.644 --> 13:41.777
I know. You have more experience
with teens in crisis.

13:41.777 --> 13:42.909
You take point.

13:44.475 --> 13:47.217
I'm Simone.

13:47.217 --> 13:50.873
Who are you, sweetie?
Hmm?

13:50.873 --> 13:55.791
I see the scars and the tattoos, but...

13:55.791 --> 13:59.360
mostly I see pain.

13:59.360 --> 14:02.015
And I hate that for you.

14:02.015 --> 14:03.843
You deserve better.

14:07.803 --> 14:11.372
What is the red-and-yellow
fist tattoo?

14:11.372 --> 14:13.722
The symbol for MNF--

14:13.722 --> 14:16.159
<i>Movimiento por
una Nación Fuerte.</i>

14:16.246 --> 14:18.814
Colombian paramilitary group
fighting the government

14:18.901 --> 14:20.511
in the jungles of
the Darién Gap.

14:20.598 --> 14:24.211
Are you MNF?

14:24.211 --> 14:27.605
Hmm?

14:27.692 --> 14:30.870
You saw death and destruction
all around you, didn't you?

14:32.697 --> 14:34.917
You were a soldier?

14:36.179 --> 14:37.441
Yes.

14:39.748 --> 14:41.271
What's your name?

14:41.271 --> 14:43.970
No.

14:43.970 --> 14:48.409
It's okay, sweetie.
But listen.

14:48.496 --> 14:51.716
Someone is willing to kill
a lot of really good people

14:51.716 --> 14:53.414
if we don't let you go.

14:53.414 --> 14:55.851
Who would
do that for you?

14:55.851 --> 14:57.070
I don't want
to be free.

14:57.070 --> 14:58.462
You want to stay
in prison?

15:00.203 --> 15:02.205
I'm safe there.

15:07.428 --> 15:09.343
That kid
seems terrified.

15:09.343 --> 15:11.301
Yeah.
Chose to rot in prison

15:11.301 --> 15:13.086
rather than face
whoever's behind all this.

15:13.086 --> 15:15.218
What the hell
is all this about?

15:21.137 --> 15:23.400
Yeah. It's me-- Gideon.

15:23.400 --> 15:26.186
I wouldn't have called
if it wasn't important.

15:26.186 --> 15:27.883
Yeah. I need you to get
out of town, like now.

15:27.883 --> 15:30.016
Hey, Gideon...

15:30.016 --> 15:31.626
We need to have
a little talk.

15:31.626 --> 15:33.454
♪ How much are
you willing to take? ♪

15:33.454 --> 15:35.978

15:48.643 --> 15:50.471
Special Agent Acres. I'm calling
about your undercover, Natalie.

15:50.558 --> 15:52.647
You need to try and pull him.
We have a credible threat.

15:52.647 --> 15:55.606
Gideon Byers, AKA
Special Agent Jason Simmons--

15:55.606 --> 15:57.478
He just sent up a flare
for an urgent exfil.

15:57.478 --> 15:59.132
Did he give a location?

16:06.661 --> 16:07.923
We have an agent down!

16:07.923 --> 16:10.752
We need an R.A. at the corner
of Sierra and Flora!

16:10.752 --> 16:11.796
Jason?

16:11.796 --> 16:12.972
Who attacked you?

16:12.972 --> 16:14.190
Did they get far?

16:14.190 --> 16:15.235
They went that way.

16:15.235 --> 16:16.845
What?
David Eaton.

16:16.845 --> 16:19.674
His nickname's Fatback.
He's white, 5'9"...

16:19.674 --> 16:20.631
Okay.
Stay with him.

16:20.631 --> 16:21.981
Yeah.

16:22.982 --> 16:25.071
Hey, Jason.
How you doing?

16:25.071 --> 16:27.290
Hey. I haven't heard
that name in a while, man.

16:27.290 --> 16:29.597
I know. I'm-- I'm Brendon.
Brendon Acres.

16:29.597 --> 16:31.294
Hey. How you doing?

16:31.294 --> 16:33.383
So, it's-- it's a little deep,
but let's...

16:33.383 --> 16:34.689
I've been better, man.

16:34.689 --> 16:36.473
...put some pressure on it.
I know. I know.

16:36.473 --> 16:40.869
Hey. Where's--
Where's Rachel?

16:40.869 --> 16:44.177
Um... she's on her way.

16:44.177 --> 16:45.395
Okay.
No, no, no.

16:45.395 --> 16:46.875
Hang in there. Hang in there.
Hang in there.

16:46.875 --> 16:48.833
I just... It's okay.

16:48.833 --> 16:50.531
I want to...
I want to go home.

16:50.531 --> 16:51.706
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Hang in there.

16:51.706 --> 16:53.229
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

16:53.229 --> 16:54.491
Hang in there.
Hang in there.

16:54.491 --> 16:56.667
No, no. No. Oh.

17:17.514 --> 17:19.429
You know, you just murdered
an FBI agent.

17:19.516 --> 17:20.430
I don't
know what you're talking about.

17:20.430 --> 17:21.692
I didn't murder anybody.

17:21.692 --> 17:23.303
Yeah, well, I caught you
with the murder weapon.

17:23.303 --> 17:26.132
Self-defense weapon. Yeah.

17:26.132 --> 17:29.439
Some guy I barely know
came at me throwing fists.

17:29.439 --> 17:31.224
Self-defense.
I got witnesses.

17:31.224 --> 17:32.529
Yeah?
They'll testify.

17:32.529 --> 17:34.792
Well, then, can you explain this
mystery text, hmm,

17:34.879 --> 17:36.142
that you got
10 minutes ago?

17:36.142 --> 17:37.360
I never even saw
that text.

17:37.360 --> 17:38.709
I'm terrible at
checking my phone.

17:38.709 --> 17:40.102
Just ask my girlfriend.

17:40.102 --> 17:41.234
Now is not a great time
for jokes.

17:43.888 --> 17:45.890
Yeah. Not a great time
for questions either.

17:45.890 --> 17:47.240
I know my rights.
Go run and get me a lawyer.

17:47.240 --> 17:48.676
Yeah.
Let's get him out of here.

17:48.676 --> 17:49.807
- Hey.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:49.807 --> 17:50.895
- Are you laughing?!
- Whoa!

17:50.895 --> 17:52.462
Are you laughing?! Huh?!

17:52.462 --> 17:53.594
Alright.

17:53.594 --> 17:54.682
He's laughing.

17:54.682 --> 17:56.814
Yes. Yes. But putting
your hands on him

17:56.814 --> 17:59.382
is not gonna change anything,
so stand down!

18:11.742 --> 18:13.092
<i>Tío?</i>

18:15.616 --> 18:18.923
<i>Tío?</i>

18:18.923 --> 18:20.403
Huh.

18:23.624 --> 18:25.191
<i>Tío?</i>

18:25.278 --> 18:27.062
Elena.

18:27.149 --> 18:28.629
What the hell
are you doing here?

18:28.716 --> 18:30.718
You should be back
in the office.

18:30.718 --> 18:32.154
He's awake...

18:32.154 --> 18:34.809
and trying to
control everything.

18:34.809 --> 18:37.203
Well, that is very
on brand for Matt.

18:37.203 --> 18:39.422
Um, and what are
the doctors saying?

18:39.509 --> 18:41.163
That they don't foresee
any further complications

18:41.163 --> 18:43.339
and he should make
a full recovery.

18:43.339 --> 18:46.473
Thank God.
We needed some good news today.

18:46.473 --> 18:47.648
When do you think
they'll send him home?

18:47.735 --> 18:49.998
If all goes well, tomorrow.

18:49.998 --> 18:52.348
You should know he's already
asked me about the case.

18:52.348 --> 18:54.220
And he's
a master interrogator.

18:54.307 --> 18:55.786
I might crack.

18:55.786 --> 18:58.006
Just tell him I've got
everything under control.

18:58.006 --> 18:59.790
Yeah. And the most important
thing for now

18:59.790 --> 19:01.096
is to get some rest.

19:01.096 --> 19:03.838
Have you met the man?
I gotta go.

19:03.838 --> 19:06.362
Thanks, Elena.

19:06.362 --> 19:08.756
You okay, B?

19:11.672 --> 19:13.804
No.

19:13.804 --> 19:15.676
You know Jason
had a wife?

19:15.676 --> 19:17.199
Rachel.

19:17.199 --> 19:18.983
Hadn't seen her in months
because he's been on this op.

19:18.983 --> 19:20.507
But he's never
gonna see her again.

19:20.507 --> 19:23.249
I'm so sorry.
And I know you're angry and--

19:23.249 --> 19:25.164
No.
I was angry an hour ago.

19:25.164 --> 19:28.689
This is like, uh...

19:28.689 --> 19:30.299
I got rage.

19:30.299 --> 19:33.433
Okay. Well,
you can't let it control you.

19:33.433 --> 19:35.522
I mean, that's not gonna
help his family.

19:35.522 --> 19:37.611
It's not gonna help you
catch the person behind this.

19:37.611 --> 19:39.047
You got to--

19:39.047 --> 19:41.441
Simone,
he bled out in my hands.

19:41.441 --> 19:43.399
- Brendon, here's the thing.
- Carter!

19:45.096 --> 19:47.229
Carter, this--
this self-defense thing,

19:47.229 --> 19:48.578
it can't possibly work, right?

19:48.578 --> 19:50.232
A good defense lawyer
can make an argument

19:50.232 --> 19:51.407
that there's no
definitive proof

19:51.407 --> 19:53.714
that he knew Jason
was an undercover agent.

19:53.801 --> 19:55.019
- What?
- There's always one juror.

19:55.019 --> 19:56.891
- Oh, so he could walk.
- He might.

19:56.891 --> 19:58.632
Look.
It's been a long day.

19:58.632 --> 19:59.720
He's already lawyered up.

19:59.807 --> 20:02.157
Everybody go home
and get some rest.

20:02.244 --> 20:03.724
How are we
supposed to do that

20:03.811 --> 20:05.378
when another undercover's
name

20:05.465 --> 20:06.814
is gonna be released
at 10:00 a.m.?

20:06.814 --> 20:08.250
I know.
And the Cyber Crime Unit

20:08.250 --> 20:09.686
is trying to determine
who sent that text.

20:09.686 --> 20:12.385
But until they do,
there's nothing we can do.

20:12.385 --> 20:14.300
So... go home.

20:14.387 --> 20:15.823
No.

20:15.823 --> 20:19.348
Brendon... go home.

20:25.746 --> 20:27.530
B, uh--

20:36.539 --> 20:38.019
Hey.

20:38.019 --> 20:39.977
Hi.

20:39.977 --> 20:42.328
I, uh, I-I--
I don't know if you heard,

20:42.415 --> 20:45.113
but, uh, Garza is--
is gonna be okay.

20:45.113 --> 20:47.768
I heard.
Such a relief.

20:47.768 --> 20:50.336
Um, so, listen.
There's a...

20:50.336 --> 20:52.990
restaurant that's opening
in, um, NoHo.

20:53.077 --> 20:55.993
I-I thought maybe you would,
you know, like it.

20:56.080 --> 20:57.647
I'm sorry. What?

20:57.647 --> 20:59.736
Um...
Hey.
You going down?

20:59.736 --> 21:00.694
Yes.

21:03.784 --> 21:04.741
You coming?

21:04.741 --> 21:07.178
Uh, no.
I-I forgot something.

21:07.178 --> 21:09.137
Did you need to talk to me
about something?

21:11.008 --> 21:13.097
No.
Uh, tomorrow's fine.

21:14.882 --> 21:17.014
So, uh,
you were saying...

21:17.014 --> 21:19.408
Oh, I got that.

21:19.408 --> 21:21.802
You have to tell me-- How
did you do that with the ribs,

21:21.802 --> 21:23.760
where the meat falls
right off the bone like that?

21:23.760 --> 21:24.805
Delicious.

21:24.805 --> 21:26.328
Put my foot in it,
didn't I?

21:26.328 --> 21:27.547
Maybe an arm
and a leg, too.

21:27.547 --> 21:30.811
Who-- Oh. Whoops.

21:30.898 --> 21:33.161
Oh, Simone, I didn't know
you were having a date.

21:33.161 --> 21:34.771
Uh, I'll be in my room.

21:34.771 --> 21:37.470
Daddy, stop.
It's not a date.

21:37.557 --> 21:39.385
You remember John.
He's my friend.

21:39.385 --> 21:40.342
Nice to see you again, sir.

21:40.342 --> 21:43.998
Oh, yeah. John. Hello.

21:43.998 --> 21:45.826
I never know
with Simone.

21:45.826 --> 21:47.610
I mean,
she keeps me guessing.

21:47.697 --> 21:49.656
Yeah.
It's part of her charm.

21:49.656 --> 21:53.616
And may I say,
you have a fantastic house.

21:53.616 --> 21:55.966
I'm a huge fan
of mid-century modern as well.

21:55.966 --> 21:58.839
It's just--
It's so sleek yet functional.

21:58.839 --> 22:01.668
It's--
It's sophisticated but curvy.

22:01.668 --> 22:03.931
Are you talking about
the house or me?

22:03.931 --> 22:06.716
Well, it'll be an
honor to take on this project,

22:06.716 --> 22:08.501
add a little more value
to your home.

22:08.501 --> 22:11.939
Uh, uh, John is
an architecture nerd

22:11.939 --> 22:15.029
and just doesn't know
when to shut up about houses.

22:15.029 --> 22:17.858
No, no, no.
Please, John, keep talking.

22:17.858 --> 22:19.338
'Cause I'd just love
to hear all about

22:19.338 --> 22:22.515
this project
happening in <i>my</i> house.

22:22.515 --> 22:25.648
Well, uh, maybe, I could just,
uh, get out of here

22:25.648 --> 22:27.389
and-- and send it to you
in an e-mail.

22:27.389 --> 22:30.653
I was talking to John
about converting the garage

22:30.653 --> 22:33.177
into a unit
with a separate entrance--

22:33.177 --> 22:34.962
just out of curiosity.

22:34.962 --> 22:36.398
Curiosity, huh?

22:36.398 --> 22:38.400
Well, you're awfully
damn curious

22:38.400 --> 22:40.228
for someone who doesn't
own this place.

22:40.315 --> 22:41.969
Gonna let myself out.

22:42.056 --> 22:44.841
Mm, don't you know when a fellow
officer needs backup?

22:44.841 --> 22:48.758
Simone, you said that you were
staying here temporarily,

22:48.845 --> 22:53.415
and now you want to rebuild
my house to fit your lifestyle.

22:53.415 --> 22:55.417
Unbelievable!

22:55.417 --> 22:57.506
Daddy,
why are you tripping?

22:57.506 --> 23:02.076
I'm tripping? Huh? John,
w-who's tripping here? Hmm?

23:02.076 --> 23:05.688
Oh, I'm a-- I'm a terrible
judge of, uh, tripping, sir.

23:05.775 --> 23:06.820
It's always been a blind spot
for me.

23:06.820 --> 23:08.169
Okay.
Well, let me help you.

23:08.169 --> 23:10.780
I'm not. She is.

23:15.350 --> 23:17.352
Dessert?

23:22.183 --> 23:24.054
Uh, sure. Yeah.

23:24.054 --> 23:26.056
Just as quickly as you can,
if you don't mind.

23:26.056 --> 23:29.277
Yeah. Okay. Perfect.

23:29.277 --> 23:30.931
Thank you very much.

23:30.931 --> 23:33.673
Yeah. Thanks. Bye.

23:33.673 --> 23:36.066
What are you still doing here?
Carter told us to go home.

23:36.066 --> 23:37.677
You're still here.

23:37.677 --> 23:39.722
Hey. Do not talk back
to your training agent.

23:39.809 --> 23:42.464
I figured I'd hang back
while the Cyber Unit

23:42.464 --> 23:44.248
tracks the text
that got Jason killed.

23:44.248 --> 23:47.251
Turns out the burner phone
where the text originated from

23:47.251 --> 23:48.470
was never turned off.

23:48.470 --> 23:49.950
They were able
to track its location.

23:50.037 --> 23:51.734
Turns out
LAPD just picked it up

23:51.734 --> 23:53.562
in a trash can
at 6th and Normandie.

23:53.562 --> 23:54.824
Maybe one of the businesses has,
like, a--

23:54.824 --> 23:56.130
Security camera?
Yeah.

23:56.130 --> 23:57.174
That's who I was
just talking to.

23:57.174 --> 23:58.785
Zussman's Jewelers.

23:58.785 --> 24:00.743
They're sending me over
their footage from 9:47 a.m.,

24:00.743 --> 24:01.962
when the text was sent.

24:01.962 --> 24:03.267
Mm.

24:03.267 --> 24:04.878
Wait.

24:11.145 --> 24:12.712
Ooh. Hey.
Screen-grab that.

24:13.843 --> 24:15.932
Maybe facial recognition
can help I.D. him.

24:15.932 --> 24:17.325
It's got to be the guy who stole
the list of undercovers.

24:17.325 --> 24:18.761
Yeah. Could be.

24:18.848 --> 24:20.241
I'm gonna send out
a BOLO citywide.

24:26.116 --> 24:27.640
Hey, boss!

24:27.727 --> 24:29.772
Look who came to brighten up
your evening.

24:29.859 --> 24:32.427
Flowers, huh?
Was that in case I croaked?

24:32.427 --> 24:34.995
What? You would rather have
a teddy bear instead?

24:35.082 --> 24:36.518
Only if it's carrying
a pepperoni pizza.

24:36.518 --> 24:38.128
Simone,
the food here sucks.

24:40.217 --> 24:41.915
How you feeling?

24:41.915 --> 24:44.178
I should be
asking you that.

24:44.178 --> 24:47.007
Me?
I'm better than ever. You.

24:47.007 --> 24:48.356
I'm good.

24:48.356 --> 24:50.227
At lying.

24:50.227 --> 24:52.969
I'm a professional investigator,
too, Simone.

24:52.969 --> 24:55.015
I mean, why else would you
be visiting late at night?

24:55.015 --> 24:57.147
I mean, I know I'm irresistible.
I can't help it.

24:57.147 --> 25:00.673
But something's up.
Talk to me.

25:02.457 --> 25:04.764
I stepped in it
with my father.

25:04.764 --> 25:06.330
What'd you do this time?

25:06.330 --> 25:08.898
Nothing! It's him.

25:08.898 --> 25:11.684
He likes having me at home
and knows he needs me there.

25:11.684 --> 25:14.338
But he keeps
pushing me away.

25:14.338 --> 25:15.862
This is refreshing.

25:15.862 --> 25:18.081
You are always so on point
with other people's emotions.

25:18.081 --> 25:20.344
It's kinda nice to know
that you have a blind spot.

25:20.344 --> 25:23.043
I think not.
I know my father.

25:23.043 --> 25:25.698
Correction. You know how
he presents himself to you.

25:25.698 --> 25:28.483
He's a strong, stubborn man, Simone.

25:28.570 --> 25:31.225
He probably is afraid
to acknowledge the fact

25:31.225 --> 25:33.140
that he can't do everything
that he used to.

25:33.227 --> 25:37.057
And the hardest thing for a man
of a certain age to outgrow...

25:37.144 --> 25:38.449
is our pride.

25:38.449 --> 25:39.929
Our bodies start to wane.

25:39.929 --> 25:43.324
Our... vanity kicks us
in the <i>cojones.</i>

25:43.324 --> 25:46.022
Okay.

25:46.022 --> 25:47.937
You might
have a point there.

25:47.937 --> 25:49.809
Mm.

25:49.809 --> 25:51.201
You want me to get you
some more water?

25:51.288 --> 25:52.812
Yeah. Please.

25:52.812 --> 25:55.510
These poor overworked nurses
are quiet-quitting on me.

26:00.297 --> 26:01.995
Something
to do with the case?

26:01.995 --> 26:03.300
None of your business.

26:03.300 --> 26:06.042
Come on, Simone.
What's happening? Tell me.

26:06.042 --> 26:09.089
Uh, what's happening is
you're resting and I'll be back.

26:10.873 --> 26:14.573
Hello? Does anybody work
around here?

26:14.573 --> 26:16.618
Ooh! Excuse me.

26:16.618 --> 26:19.447
Doctor, I need, uh,
some water for a patient.

26:19.447 --> 26:20.796
Sorry.
They need me in the O.R.,

26:20.796 --> 26:22.885
but I will have them
send a nurse, okay?

26:37.857 --> 26:39.423
Oh, no.

26:50.739 --> 26:54.003
Sir, did you see anyone
come in this room?

26:59.705 --> 27:01.707
Help!
Somebody help! Please!

27:01.707 --> 27:03.709
Help! Somebody help!

27:07.713 --> 27:08.975
Help!

27:19.028 --> 27:20.639
My keen powers of deduction
are telling me

27:20.639 --> 27:23.163
this guy's not
a real doctor, huh?

27:23.163 --> 27:25.556
You just had to be a part of
the action, didn't you?

27:25.556 --> 27:27.167
I just wanted
a little more water.

27:28.690 --> 27:30.083
This is the worst
hospital ever.

27:38.744 --> 27:40.528
He came all this way
to kill Roger.

27:40.528 --> 27:42.138
He's gotta be the big bad, right?

27:42.138 --> 27:43.705
The guy with the list?

27:43.705 --> 27:45.533
We heard you were
back in action, boss.

27:45.533 --> 27:46.621
Simone did all
the heavy lifting.

27:46.621 --> 27:47.840
I just sealed the deal.

27:47.840 --> 27:49.842
Oh. Hey.
You guys, uh, came together?

27:49.842 --> 27:51.408
We were having coffee.

27:51.408 --> 27:53.759
We were kicking ass.

27:53.759 --> 27:56.283
Oh. It's a little late
for coffee, isn't it?

27:56.283 --> 27:57.806
Well, decaf.

27:57.806 --> 28:00.374
Okay. This guy is in custody,
but the danger's not over.

28:00.374 --> 28:02.071
It's possible he has
a fail-safe plan

28:02.071 --> 28:04.073
to release another name,
so we need to go r--Laura: Matt.

28:04.073 --> 28:05.509
Stop.

28:05.509 --> 28:08.208
Yeah. Stand down, boss.
Carter's got it.

28:08.208 --> 28:09.731
Sorry.

28:09.731 --> 28:11.864
No problem.
Take him back to bed, will you?

28:11.864 --> 28:13.213
Make sure he gets in it.

28:13.300 --> 28:14.997
Oh, you know what?
I'm not a child. You just--

28:15.084 --> 28:16.956
Oh, no.
Of course you're not.

28:19.828 --> 28:23.005
What is up with Carter
and Antoinette getting drinks?

28:23.092 --> 28:24.572
Not drinks.
Just coffee.

28:24.572 --> 28:26.313
Oh.
I smell hot goss.

28:26.313 --> 28:28.794
Are Carter and Antoinette, like,
a thing or what's going on?

28:28.794 --> 28:30.404
I-I don't know.
I'd like to know that, too.

28:30.404 --> 28:32.014
Look. E-Everyone gets coffee
with Carter.

28:32.101 --> 28:33.581
He's got
big-brother energy.

28:33.581 --> 28:36.105
I leave your side for one night
and you get into a street fight?

28:36.105 --> 28:37.716
Okay. Hey, first of all,
it wasn't a street fight.

28:37.716 --> 28:39.021
We were indoors.

28:39.108 --> 28:41.154
And Simone did all of
the dangerous stuff, so...

28:41.154 --> 28:43.243
<i>Tío,</i> from now on,
if you even think about

28:43.330 --> 28:44.810
getting out of bed
without permission,

28:44.897 --> 28:46.333
I am cuffing you
to the rail.

28:47.160 --> 28:49.249
Jorge Peña.

28:49.249 --> 28:50.816
It's nice to finally
meet you in person.

28:50.816 --> 28:52.339
How do you know
my name?

28:52.339 --> 28:54.254
You were fingerprinted
when you came to this country

28:54.254 --> 28:56.169
from Colombia
as a refugee.

28:56.169 --> 28:57.823
Now, where's the list
you stole from us?

28:57.823 --> 29:00.695
I stole nothing.
I'm innocent.

29:00.695 --> 29:03.132
You tried to kill me,
a deputy,

29:03.132 --> 29:05.482
and a man out there
with a broken arm.

29:05.482 --> 29:07.049
You're far from innocent.

29:07.049 --> 29:08.790
Now,
where's the damn list?

29:08.790 --> 29:11.140
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

29:11.140 --> 29:12.620
I swear.

29:17.016 --> 29:18.278
Are you hearing
what I'm hearing?

29:18.365 --> 29:19.932
That he doesn't
sound like the man on the phone?

29:19.932 --> 29:22.499
Yep.

29:22.499 --> 29:25.241
So you're not the man
with the list,

29:25.241 --> 29:27.722
but you work for him.
Hmm?

29:27.722 --> 29:31.247
He ordered you to give
an undercover agent's photo

29:31.247 --> 29:34.816
to Fatback
<i>and</i> to kill all the loose ends

29:34.816 --> 29:36.862
from the bank robbery, right?

29:36.949 --> 29:37.950
Yes.

29:37.950 --> 29:39.603
Why?

29:39.603 --> 29:42.868
I was a soldier...
in Colombia.

29:42.868 --> 29:46.523
I had very...
special skills.

29:46.610 --> 29:49.309
Make problems disappear.
You understand.

29:49.309 --> 29:51.137
And I come here.

29:51.137 --> 29:53.269
I live American life,
and I pay taxes.

29:53.269 --> 29:54.880
Go to baseball games.

29:54.880 --> 29:57.665
It's...
It's quite nice--

29:57.665 --> 30:01.451
until a man I knew back home
found me.

30:01.451 --> 30:04.280
He's the kind of man
you don't say no to.

30:04.280 --> 30:05.673
Tell us his name.

30:05.760 --> 30:08.110
I can't.
He's dangerous.

30:08.197 --> 30:10.547
So is the death penalty.

30:10.547 --> 30:14.464
And that's what you're gonna
be facing if you don't help us.

30:14.464 --> 30:16.466
What's his name?

30:17.685 --> 30:19.643
Good morning, Raul.

30:20.644 --> 30:22.255
That's right,
sweet thing.

30:22.255 --> 30:24.692
We know exactly
who you are.

30:24.692 --> 30:26.302
We're dope like that.

30:26.302 --> 30:28.304
More importantly,
we know who your brother is.

30:28.304 --> 30:29.653
Cesar Almunia,

30:29.653 --> 30:31.655
former officer
in Colombia's

30:31.655 --> 30:33.222
National Intelligence Directorate.

30:33.222 --> 30:34.745
He got fed up
with the government,

30:34.745 --> 30:37.792
switched sides, and founded
the MNF paramilitary group.

30:37.792 --> 30:42.057
Your brother is known
as the Butcher of Bogotá...

30:42.057 --> 30:44.016
but you looked up to him.

30:44.016 --> 30:47.062
And shortly after
he started the MNF, you joined.

30:47.062 --> 30:49.238
You know nothing.

30:49.238 --> 30:51.110
I know you wanted
to escape the violence.

30:51.110 --> 30:52.459
Didn't you?

30:52.459 --> 30:57.507
Raul, we filed an application
for emergency amnesty.

30:57.507 --> 30:59.770
We are going to
keep you safe.

30:59.770 --> 31:01.642
W-Why would you
help me?

31:01.642 --> 31:03.731
Because somebody has to.

31:03.731 --> 31:06.734
And just like we're helping you,
you can help people, too.

31:06.821 --> 31:08.954
Tell us
what this is all about.

31:11.434 --> 31:14.611
My brother.

31:14.698 --> 31:18.224
He-- He sent me here
to negotiate a weapons deal--

31:18.224 --> 31:22.489
$10 million for hundreds
of RPGs and small arms,

31:22.489 --> 31:24.621
enough to ensure
the conflict back home

31:24.708 --> 31:27.276
continues for a decade.

31:27.276 --> 31:29.104
I was the only one
he trusted.

31:29.104 --> 31:30.845
But you didn't
go through with it.

31:30.932 --> 31:33.848
More orphans will not
make our country stronger.

31:33.848 --> 31:37.069
The payment was going to be
through a cryptocurrency,

31:37.069 --> 31:39.898
so...
I made a new account.

31:39.898 --> 31:42.291
Only I know the password.

31:42.378 --> 31:45.773
So the only way your brother
can get that money...

31:45.773 --> 31:47.514
is to get to you.

31:47.601 --> 31:49.733
There was nowhere I could go
where he wouldn't find me.

31:49.733 --> 31:55.087
And if he did, torture,
pain beyond imagination.

31:55.087 --> 31:56.915
So you went to the safest place
you can think of.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.307
Federal prison.

31:58.307 --> 32:01.093
But he found me,
even here.

32:01.093 --> 32:04.096
I guess his contacts at the
intelligence services paid off.

32:04.096 --> 32:06.576
Carter,
I have a crazy idea.

32:06.663 --> 32:08.187
How crazy?

32:08.187 --> 32:10.537
You want to stop the violence,
the killing?

32:10.537 --> 32:12.191
Yeah.

32:12.191 --> 32:14.758
Raul,
I need you to trust us.

32:14.758 --> 32:16.630
Your plan is what now?

32:16.630 --> 32:19.894
Raul gave us the password
to his cryptocurrency account.

32:19.981 --> 32:21.983
This is what
Cesar really wants.

32:24.290 --> 32:26.205
That's Cesar calling to say
he's releasing

32:26.205 --> 32:28.207
the name of
another undercover agent.

32:28.207 --> 32:30.078
And you're telling me
you want me

32:30.078 --> 32:31.471
to let a known
war criminal walk

32:31.471 --> 32:33.429
with $10 million
in untraceable money?

32:33.429 --> 32:35.779
Tracy, it's either that
or another one of our own dies.

32:35.779 --> 32:37.999
And it's not really
walking away.

32:37.999 --> 32:39.435
He still has to
buy weapons.

32:39.435 --> 32:41.698
And Raul gave us the name
of the arms dealer

32:41.785 --> 32:43.135
he was gonna meet with.

32:43.135 --> 32:44.963
And Brendon and Laura
are working on tracing him.

32:44.963 --> 32:46.355
- And have they?
- Not yet, but--

32:46.355 --> 32:48.357
Great.

32:48.357 --> 32:50.577
Carter, this is quite
the position you've put me in.

32:52.796 --> 32:55.277
This is Special Agent in Charge
Tracy Chiles.

32:55.277 --> 32:58.150
You did not release
prisoner 43602.

32:59.499 --> 33:03.068
Uh, no, but we do have
a series of numbers

33:03.068 --> 33:05.635
<i>that he said
would be important to you.</i>

33:05.635 --> 33:10.205
We could give them to you if you
agree to stop releasing names.

33:10.205 --> 33:11.641
Agreed.

33:11.641 --> 33:13.252
Give me the numbers.

33:27.831 --> 33:30.834
Okay. So we're good.

33:41.410 --> 33:42.846
Are we happy?

33:49.636 --> 33:52.117
FBI! Don't do it!
Drop your weapons on the ground!

33:52.204 --> 33:53.727
Drop 'em!

33:56.295 --> 33:58.253
- FBI! You're surrounded!
- Hey! FBI! Hands up! Hands up.

33:58.253 --> 33:59.559
Hey. Okay.

34:05.347 --> 34:08.698
You remember talking to me
on the phone, Cesar?

34:08.785 --> 34:10.787
Oh, don't be like that.

34:10.874 --> 34:14.182
It's not my fault we're better
at our jobs than you are.

34:21.711 --> 34:24.801
So this is it?
Our list of undercover agents?

34:24.888 --> 34:26.586
With all 214 names,

34:26.673 --> 34:28.283
including
Special Agent Jason Simmons.

34:28.283 --> 34:30.024
May he rest in peace.

34:30.024 --> 34:32.505
We recovered it in
an apartment Cesar was using.

34:32.505 --> 34:34.028
No copies?

34:34.028 --> 34:35.377
None that we found.

34:35.464 --> 34:36.813
But Cesar is not talking,

34:36.813 --> 34:38.728
so there's no way
to know for sure.

34:38.728 --> 34:41.035
Hey.

34:41.122 --> 34:44.386
You did good today
in your first foray as boss.

34:44.386 --> 34:46.040
I know.

34:46.127 --> 34:47.563
But Matt's being released tonight,

34:47.563 --> 34:50.436
so this temporary assignment
is officially over.

34:51.828 --> 34:53.830
Carter?

34:53.917 --> 34:56.790
Your time for advancement
will come.

34:56.790 --> 34:59.271
Oh, it already has--
several times.

34:59.358 --> 35:01.838
They just always gave
the promotion to someone else.

35:04.493 --> 35:05.494
Night, Tracy.

35:05.494 --> 35:06.974
Night.

35:15.156 --> 35:17.158
You good, B?

35:17.158 --> 35:19.726
Yeah. I'm okay.

35:19.726 --> 35:20.857
You?

35:20.857 --> 35:22.381
Yeah, I'm good.

35:22.381 --> 35:25.862
But I also didn't have
an agent die in my arms.

35:25.949 --> 35:27.951
You want to talk
about it?

35:27.951 --> 35:29.127
Not yet.

35:29.127 --> 35:31.912
Okay.
Well, when you do...

35:31.912 --> 35:34.567
Oh, and earlier,

35:34.567 --> 35:37.396
when I was telling you
you needed to pull up?

35:37.396 --> 35:39.528
I don't want you to think
I was being cruel.

35:39.528 --> 35:42.314
I was just trying to keep you
focused on the task at hand.

35:42.314 --> 35:44.229
I needed a Simone-style boot
in the butt,

35:44.229 --> 35:45.882
so it's okay.

35:45.969 --> 35:48.798
These are for kicking ass
<i>and</i> looking fly.

35:48.798 --> 35:50.452
It's crazy, though.

35:50.539 --> 35:53.107
We've been feds
less than three months.

35:53.107 --> 35:56.719
And this is the second funeral
for a fallen agent.

35:56.719 --> 35:58.678
At least the Bureau does it
right, you know? Classy.

35:58.765 --> 36:00.419
But when them
bagpipes start?

36:00.419 --> 36:01.550
Oh, my God.

36:01.550 --> 36:03.335
The waterworks![ Laughing ] Yeah.

36:03.335 --> 36:06.338
Jason won't, uh,
have a formal funeral.

36:06.338 --> 36:07.730
It'll be small and quiet.

36:07.730 --> 36:09.210
Why?

36:09.210 --> 36:11.169
'Cause he was killed
while undercover.

36:11.169 --> 36:13.606
They don't have parades.
No fanfare.

36:13.606 --> 36:15.782
Secrecy of the op
comes first.

36:15.782 --> 36:17.218
Yeah, but his cover
was already blown.

36:17.218 --> 36:18.132
I mean,
it's-- it's out there.

36:18.132 --> 36:19.742
It doesn't matter.

36:19.742 --> 36:21.570
There's still plenty of assets
he came in contact with

36:21.570 --> 36:23.659
that need protecting,

36:23.659 --> 36:26.445
other ongoing operations
that he was connected to

36:26.445 --> 36:28.098
with principals who may not
know the truth.

36:28.098 --> 36:29.578
Yeah, but that
doesn't seem right.

36:29.578 --> 36:32.407
It's not.
But it's the job.

36:32.407 --> 36:34.670
Well, I'm still going.

36:34.670 --> 36:36.629
<i>We</i> are still going.

36:39.109 --> 36:40.023
- Alright.
- Call me later.

36:40.023 --> 36:41.024
Uh-huh.

36:41.024 --> 36:42.287
- Good night, y'all.
- See ya.

36:47.553 --> 36:50.295
If I've learned anything
these past few days,

36:50.295 --> 36:52.079
it's that life's too short
to play games.

36:52.166 --> 36:54.908
So...

36:54.908 --> 36:56.910
I'm gonna go
talk to Antoinette.

36:56.910 --> 36:58.085
I'm gonna tell her
how I feel.

36:58.172 --> 37:00.522
Ah. Finally.

37:00.609 --> 37:03.743
But, um, maybe
change your shirt first.

Well...

He's got
big-brother energy.

37:55.882 --> 37:57.405
Mm.

37:57.405 --> 37:59.364
Big brothers got to date, too, right?

38:01.931 --> 38:03.019
See ya.

38:14.466 --> 38:16.294
Hey.

38:19.166 --> 38:22.561
It was presumptuous of me
to try to convert the garage

38:22.561 --> 38:24.998
without talking to you
about it first.

38:24.998 --> 38:26.565
And I'm sorry.

38:28.349 --> 38:30.177
That was
all kinds of wrong.

38:30.264 --> 38:32.266
What the hell
were you thinking?

38:32.266 --> 38:37.315
Well, Daddy, I was thinking that
we both have busy schedules

38:37.315 --> 38:41.057
and active dating lives, and...

38:41.144 --> 38:43.538
it was just a bad attempt
at me trying

38:43.538 --> 38:45.671
to give you
some of your space back.

38:45.671 --> 38:49.631
Like you said, my being here was
only supposed to be temporary.

38:49.631 --> 38:51.285
Hm.

38:51.285 --> 38:53.722
You want me to leave,
Daddy?

38:53.722 --> 38:55.420
Course not.

38:55.420 --> 38:58.074
But hey,
l-let's keep it real.

38:58.074 --> 39:00.512
I <i>am</i> getting older.

39:00.512 --> 39:04.385
And this house will
belong to you

39:04.385 --> 39:06.648
and the twins eventually.

39:06.648 --> 39:10.304
So it wasn't a bad idea
to be thinking about the future.

39:10.304 --> 39:11.827
Wait. Hold on.

39:11.827 --> 39:14.743
I know you're not trying to get
out of here any time soon,

39:14.743 --> 39:16.310
are you?
No.

39:16.310 --> 39:18.834
I'm not going anywhere
anytime soon, baby girl.

39:18.834 --> 39:21.402
All I'm saying is that
your instinct

39:21.402 --> 39:25.058
to make it more comfortable
for yourself here was right.

39:25.058 --> 39:29.323
But where you went wrong was
not getting my blessing first.

39:31.325 --> 39:32.674
Daddy,
can I have your blessing?

39:34.763 --> 39:38.158
Would you get that?
It's for you.

39:42.249 --> 39:43.598
John?
Hello!

39:43.598 --> 39:44.904
What's up, cute thing?

39:44.991 --> 39:46.558
Hey.
Come on in, man.

39:46.558 --> 39:49.604
I invited him over.

39:49.604 --> 39:53.042
Look, it got a little heated
last night,

39:53.042 --> 39:55.915
and for my part in that,
I am sorry.

39:55.915 --> 39:57.569
Well, I did eat
all the short ribs.

39:57.569 --> 39:59.788
What do you say
we just call it even?

39:59.875 --> 40:03.139
This is a long way for him
to come for an apology, Daddy,

40:03.139 --> 40:04.489
that could have happened
over the phone.

40:04.576 --> 40:06.795
Well, that's not
the only reason.

40:06.795 --> 40:10.364
I, um, asked him if
he could walk us both

40:10.364 --> 40:13.280
through the feasibility
of converting the garage.

40:16.631 --> 40:17.850
Daddy!

40:17.937 --> 40:19.939
Oh, thank you!

40:19.939 --> 40:22.376
Now, take it easy. We haven't
even discussed a deposit.

40:22.376 --> 40:24.378
I mean, my rates
can get pretty steep.

40:24.378 --> 40:27.033
We should be getting
the friends-and-family discount.

40:27.033 --> 40:28.817
I might be
able to work that in

40:28.817 --> 40:31.167
if we could work in
a weekly delivery of cookies

40:31.167 --> 40:33.256
and pies
from Cutty's bakery.

40:33.256 --> 40:35.607
Deal.
Ooh!

40:35.607 --> 40:38.784
If I throw in some of my
fall-off-the-bone short ribs,

40:38.784 --> 40:40.960
could we talk about
maybe a plunge pool

40:41.047 --> 40:42.135
and a theater room?

40:42.135 --> 40:44.354
Simone,
the ribs are good.

40:44.354 --> 40:45.399
They're not <i>that</i> good.

40:45.399 --> 40:46.922
- Here it comes.
- Okay.

40:46.922 --> 40:48.707
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa,
- whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Here it comes.

40:48.707 --> 40:50.578
Let him
do the work first!

40:50.578 --> 40:53.146
- Do not...
-"And that's how he died."

40:53.146 --> 40:55.322
♪ White port and lemon juice
