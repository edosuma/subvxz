01:40.850 --> 01:41.518
- Sumimasen.
- Hai.

01:41.601 --> 01:43.853
- Hai.

01:47.941 --> 01:50.318
- Domo.
- Hai. Arigato.

01:50.401 --> 01:52.445
- Hai.

01:53.571 --> 01:55.615
- Please take us here.

01:56.407 --> 01:57.784
- Your Japanese is excellent.

01:59.577 --> 02:00.620
- Thank you.

02:00.995 --> 02:02.247
- First time in Japan?

02:04.040 --> 02:05.750
- First time anywhere.

02:06.835 --> 02:08.586
- Long flight. Must be tired.

02:08.920 --> 02:10.839
- I'm fine.

02:19.013 --> 02:20.306
I've never been better.

02:27.647 --> 02:31.234
- Our Heavenly
Father, thank You for this day

02:31.317 --> 02:34.654
and for this wonderful group
of people in Kitakyushu.

02:34.737 --> 02:36.489
Sister Porter

02:36.573 --> 02:37.448
Please help us
to share Your teachings...

02:37.532 --> 02:39.367
Good morning!

02:39.450 --> 02:40.827
Would you be interested
in free English lessons?

02:40.910 --> 02:43.037
- And love
to those who need it in Japan.

02:43.121 --> 02:44.163
- Excuse me.
Free English lessons?

02:44.247 --> 02:45.415
- In the name

02:45.498 --> 02:46.332
of Jesus Christ...
- Amen.

02:46.416 --> 02:48.710
- Amen.

02:48.793 --> 02:50.795
- Sumimasen. Konnichiwa.

02:50.879 --> 02:51.588
Would you be interested

02:51.671 --> 02:52.714
in free English
lessons?

02:52.797 --> 02:53.923
Let's start.

02:54.007 --> 02:57.719
What's your name?

02:57.802 --> 02:58.636
Free English lessons?

02:58.720 --> 02:59.721
How old are you?

02:59.804 --> 03:01.681
Arigato gozaimasu.

03:01.764 --> 03:06.144
I am 21 years old.

03:07.979 --> 03:10.899
Where are you from?

03:10.982 --> 03:13.693
I'm from Utah.

03:13.776 --> 03:15.570
Konnichiwa.

03:15.653 --> 03:16.738
Would you be interested

03:16.821 --> 03:18.281
in the teachings of the Lord?
- No thanks.

03:38.843 --> 03:40.595
- Hi.

03:40.678 --> 03:42.096
- Hi.

03:50.021 --> 03:50.939
Would you like to learn

03:51.022 --> 03:52.941
the teachings of the Lord?

04:02.367 --> 04:03.952
- What are you doing here?

04:04.035 --> 04:05.662
- Can I come in?
- Yeah.

04:05.745 --> 04:07.330
- Okay.

04:08.915 --> 04:11.334
I'm in trouble, Pol.

04:15.088 --> 04:19.008
- So...you were like a nun?

04:19.092 --> 04:21.469
- No, we don't have nuns.
I was a missionary.

04:21.552 --> 04:22.845
- For how long?

04:22.929 --> 04:24.764
- Eighteen months.

04:24.847 --> 04:26.140
Kitakyushu.

04:26.224 --> 04:28.643
- And you did not
kill yourself?

04:28.726 --> 04:30.645
- It's considered an honor.

04:30.728 --> 04:32.271
- Mm-hmm.

04:32.355 --> 04:32.730
- I loved it.

04:32.814 --> 04:35.316
Really.

04:35.400 --> 04:36.818
I just...

04:39.821 --> 04:41.990
I couldn't go home
when it was over.

04:42.073 --> 04:43.741
- Why?

04:48.121 --> 04:50.957
- I stole 4 million in cash
from the local mission fund.

04:51.040 --> 04:53.835
- You--you stole $4 million?
- Yen.

04:53.918 --> 04:55.253
- Okay.

04:55.336 --> 04:56.754
- Not dollars. Yen.

04:56.838 --> 04:57.672
- Because for a moment,
I thought, like--

04:57.755 --> 04:59.507
- No, like 40 grand.
- Yeah.

04:59.590 --> 05:01.009
- Just to get to Tokyo,
get myself set up,

05:01.092 --> 05:02.468
build a life.
- In Tokyo?

05:02.552 --> 05:03.845
You should have taken more.

05:03.928 --> 05:05.096
- It's not funny, Pol.

05:05.179 --> 05:07.181
It's not funny.

05:09.100 --> 05:10.685
This is bad, okay?

05:10.768 --> 05:16.399
If this guy, if he turns me in
and the church requests it,

05:16.482 --> 05:18.276
they could extradite me.

05:18.359 --> 05:19.819
Send me home.

05:19.902 --> 05:22.196
- I'm immigrant.
I know what extradite is.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.032
But just for 40 grand?

05:24.115 --> 05:25.450
You can pay that back
with interest.

05:25.533 --> 05:26.117
- It's a crime.

05:26.200 --> 05:29.162
I committed a crime.

05:29.245 --> 05:31.456
I would never be able
to come back here.

05:31.539 --> 05:34.375
- Mm, I get it.
- I love my life here.

05:34.459 --> 05:37.879
I don't wanna lose everything
that I made.

05:37.962 --> 05:39.839
I made this.

05:39.922 --> 05:41.966
This is me.

05:42.050 --> 05:44.093
I cannot go back there.

05:44.177 --> 05:46.512
- Okay. Okay.

05:46.596 --> 05:48.222
So this guy who found you,

05:48.306 --> 05:49.932
he didn't turn you in yet,
right?

05:50.016 --> 05:51.392
- Mm-mm.

05:51.476 --> 05:53.978
- So what's it gonna take
to make him go away?

06:09.869 --> 06:12.080
- Hello?

06:12.163 --> 06:14.207
- Seriously, Joshua,
how many messages

06:14.290 --> 06:16.584
do I need to leave
before you call me back?

06:16.667 --> 06:18.002
- Ma.

06:18.086 --> 06:19.754
- Should I make something up?

06:19.837 --> 06:22.924
Tell you someone's died?
Would that warrant a check-in?

06:23.007 --> 06:24.425
- Jesus. Really?

06:24.509 --> 06:26.594
Hey, so yeah.
Is everything all right?

06:26.677 --> 06:28.763
How's everything?
- Everything is not all right.

06:28.846 --> 06:31.265
Your sister's getting worse.

06:31.349 --> 06:33.601
She's slipping back.

06:33.684 --> 06:35.895
That's why I've been calling.
- Okay.

06:35.978 --> 06:37.105
Uh, I don't know
what she's telling you

06:37.188 --> 06:40.775
or not telling you,
but Jessica is fine, okay?

06:40.858 --> 06:43.069
She's not that fragile anymore.
Can you trust me on that?

06:43.152 --> 06:44.403
- Oh, why,
because that's what she says

06:44.487 --> 06:45.863
on the--on the tapes
that she sends you

06:45.947 --> 06:47.448
6,000 miles away,

06:47.532 --> 06:49.951
and you think you're getting
the whole picture?

06:50.034 --> 06:53.287
If you were here,
you would see.

06:53.371 --> 06:56.582
Just come home.

06:56.666 --> 06:58.751
A short visit, that's all.

06:58.835 --> 07:02.171
- I have...a job.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.382
- Well, you also have
a family, Joshua.

07:04.465 --> 07:06.467
- It's Jake.
Not Joshua.

07:06.551 --> 07:09.095
Jake.
- That's not your name.

07:09.178 --> 07:10.304
And if you don't wanna hear
about your sister from me,

07:10.388 --> 07:12.515
you can hear it
from your father.

07:12.598 --> 07:14.183
- No. Do not put him on.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.893
I do not wanna--
I do not wanna talk to him.

07:15.977 --> 07:17.812
- Hey, Eddie. Eddie!
- No, I--

07:17.895 --> 07:19.147
- Do not put him on.

07:19.230 --> 07:20.523
- You two need
to work this out.

07:20.606 --> 07:22.859
Eddie, it's Joshua.

07:22.942 --> 07:23.985
Pick up the phone.

07:24.068 --> 07:26.028
Pick it up.

07:33.578 --> 07:35.705
I will do my best!

07:48.676 --> 07:50.219
Ahh. Ah-ah--

07:52.013 --> 07:53.973
This is real Aikido, huh?

07:57.310 --> 07:59.937
- It's Aikijutsu.

08:00.771 --> 08:01.564
Get up.

08:09.780 --> 08:10.531
You okay, old man?

08:11.115 --> 08:12.992
I'm no old man!

08:28.507 --> 08:29.967
You're good.

08:31.677 --> 08:33.054
I saw you bring coffee

08:33.137 --> 08:35.056
the other day to Katagiri.

08:35.806 --> 08:36.557
Jealous?

08:37.642 --> 08:40.269
That lone wolf shit of his,

08:40.353 --> 08:42.897
it makes men enemies.

08:45.191 --> 08:49.028
- A man without
enemies is no man at all.

08:49.111 --> 08:50.321
- What the fuck is that

08:50.404 --> 08:52.031
supposed to mean?

08:53.866 --> 08:56.077
Listen to what I'm telling you.

08:57.828 --> 09:01.290
- Uh, what, he's got enemies?

09:01.374 --> 09:03.167
What, on the force?

09:03.251 --> 09:05.086
- Not just on the force.

09:05.169 --> 09:09.966
Cops like me, we bend the rules
so we can get the job done.

09:10.049 --> 09:13.761
But Katagiri,
he ignores the rules

09:13.844 --> 09:17.014
because everything he does
is for himself.

09:19.475 --> 09:21.644
Be careful
who you put your trust in.

09:38.035 --> 09:40.371
- Katagiri-san.

09:44.625 --> 09:48.129
- The information you requested
about the mole in Chihara-kai.

09:48.212 --> 09:50.798
- Thank you.

09:50.881 --> 09:51.507
That's great. Thank you.

09:57.388 --> 09:59.974
Why don't you
just give it to him?

10:00.057 --> 10:02.977
Um, don't you think
that would be...

10:03.060 --> 10:04.812
better or more appropriate?

10:04.895 --> 10:06.647
- No.

10:11.027 --> 10:14.322
- If you don't mind me
asking...

10:14.405 --> 10:16.699
What do you get out of this?

10:16.782 --> 10:19.160
How does this help you?

10:19.243 --> 10:20.328
- Who have you been talking to?

10:20.411 --> 10:23.247
- No one. I'm just curious

10:23.331 --> 10:26.334
why you would go through
all this trouble for Ishida.

10:27.001 --> 10:28.669
- For Ishida?

10:28.753 --> 10:29.920
- Yes.

10:31.339 --> 10:34.967
Ishida says the cops think
he is bribing one of them.

10:36.218 --> 10:38.971
Don't you think
it's our own interest

10:39.055 --> 10:39.722
to find out if that's true?

10:41.140 --> 10:42.350
- No, absolutely.

10:42.975 --> 10:48.731
- In fact, the mole inside
Chihara-kai works for Tozawa.

10:49.607 --> 10:51.901
Ishida has a traitor
in his house

10:51.984 --> 10:54.070
who's spreading rumors
on behalf of his enemy.

10:54.612 --> 10:56.364
Giving Ishida the name
of that traitor

10:56.447 --> 10:58.783
puts those rumors to rest.

10:59.909 --> 11:01.494
- Mm.

11:02.495 --> 11:05.790
- Have you made progress with
the information I provided?

11:05.873 --> 11:06.999
The loan sharks?

11:07.083 --> 11:09.251
- Yes.

11:09.335 --> 11:11.253
Then we hit
a bit of a dead end.

11:11.337 --> 11:14.590
But I'm not gonna stop.

11:14.673 --> 11:15.591
I'll keep pushing.

11:15.674 --> 11:17.343
I won't let you down.

11:17.426 --> 11:20.262
- If Ishida
will be grateful for that,

11:20.346 --> 11:22.181
he will offer
a favor in return.

11:22.264 --> 11:25.226
Do not take it.

11:25.976 --> 11:27.478
- Why?

11:27.561 --> 11:31.690
- When you accept favors
from the yakuza,

11:31.774 --> 11:33.401
you open a door.

11:33.484 --> 11:37.196
Once open,
it is very hard to close.

11:39.031 --> 11:41.450
Lie down
with dogs, rise up with fleas.

11:41.534 --> 11:42.743
Got it?

11:43.661 --> 11:45.246
- Wait, is this advice

11:45.329 --> 11:48.207
that you give
to all your reporters or...

11:49.792 --> 11:52.461
Why are you helping me?

11:54.839 --> 11:57.842
You are like the son
I never had.

11:59.176 --> 11:59.718
- Really?

13:30.935 --> 13:32.186
- I don't know

13:32.269 --> 13:33.687
what to do with him.

13:34.730 --> 13:36.023
My sister and her husband
threw him out

13:36.106 --> 13:37.942
because they were at
each other's throats.

13:38.442 --> 13:41.195
But everything I have him do
at my store, he fucks up.

13:41.278 --> 13:41.779
And I lose customers.

13:42.988 --> 13:44.615
I need someone to make a man
out of him.

13:44.698 --> 13:47.660
Before it's too late for him.

13:48.077 --> 13:49.286
- I understand.

13:50.329 --> 13:52.748
You talk to him.

14:03.342 --> 14:03.842
- Oi.

14:04.635 --> 14:07.012
Wanna be a loser all your life?

14:09.014 --> 14:10.140
I'm asking you a question.

14:11.392 --> 14:12.434
- No.

14:20.484 --> 14:22.611
I was just like you.

14:23.529 --> 14:24.530
But now...

14:25.155 --> 14:27.491
What we do? It's cool.
Cool clothes. Cool cars.

14:28.242 --> 14:29.785
And you make money.

14:29.868 --> 14:32.079
Money for you.
Money for your girlfriend.

14:32.496 --> 14:33.789
Money for your family.

14:45.134 --> 14:46.594
You can either be at
this address this afternoon...

14:46.677 --> 14:49.054
or stay a loser all your life.

14:53.392 --> 14:55.019
Choice is yours.

14:56.562 --> 14:58.063
- "Choice is yours."

14:58.814 --> 15:01.025
You wrapped that up nicely.

15:02.526 --> 15:04.028
- You told me to recruit him.

15:04.111 --> 15:05.904
- When I was recruiting you...

15:05.988 --> 15:08.616
I knew you'd be worth
the investment.

15:09.825 --> 15:09.867
- Thanks.

15:14.038 --> 15:15.873
- Whatever happened
with your gaijin girlfriend?

15:15.956 --> 15:17.416
You straighten the bitch out?

15:18.792 --> 15:18.834
- Yeah.

15:44.735 --> 15:48.030
- Your help is appreciated.

15:51.909 --> 15:55.120
Now, what can I do for you?

15:56.580 --> 15:58.791
- Nothing. Thank you.

15:58.874 --> 16:01.502
- Women, perhaps.

16:01.585 --> 16:04.755
- No.
- Money then?

16:04.838 --> 16:06.757
- I'm okay. Thank you.

16:06.840 --> 16:09.009
I'm off now.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.720
- Perhaps you could use

16:11.804 --> 16:14.014
another source of information,

16:14.098 --> 16:15.265
one that operates freely

16:15.349 --> 16:20.854
within a world that
is otherwise closed to you.

16:22.523 --> 16:25.526
Yours is
a competitive profession.

16:25.609 --> 16:30.364
Not everyone succeeds.

16:30.447 --> 16:35.411
One must find an advantage
wherever he can.

16:39.581 --> 16:41.917
- There is something
I want to ask you.

16:43.794 --> 16:47.548
Do you know this company?

16:51.635 --> 16:53.053
- I do.

16:54.805 --> 16:56.807
I know this company.

16:56.890 --> 16:58.559
- Is it...

16:58.642 --> 17:01.729
your organization?

17:01.812 --> 17:04.106
- This is not Chihara-kai.

17:09.319 --> 17:11.280
Yes...

17:11.363 --> 17:14.116
we are in the loan business.

17:14.199 --> 17:16.285
All major yakuza are.

17:16.368 --> 17:18.996
But this...

17:19.079 --> 17:23.709
driving customers to suicide
to collect insurance payouts,

17:23.792 --> 17:28.088
this is not the righteous path.

17:28.172 --> 17:32.134
- If I wanted to figure out
who they were,

17:32.217 --> 17:33.427
how would I do that?

17:33.510 --> 17:40.058
- Do not look for the people
who gave the loans.

17:42.853 --> 17:47.066
Look for the people who didn't.

17:55.574 --> 17:57.701
- We've been looking
in the wrong place.

17:57.785 --> 17:58.994
Come on.

18:02.039 --> 18:04.041
The people
we spoke to originally--

18:04.124 --> 18:06.668
I just called
some of them again.

18:06.752 --> 18:07.711
Each of those families,
before they ended up here,

18:07.795 --> 18:10.297
they went here first.

18:10.380 --> 18:11.423
- Suzuno?

18:11.507 --> 18:13.509
My parents
have a home loan with them.

18:13.592 --> 18:15.511
They're legitimate.
- That might be true.

18:15.594 --> 18:18.722
But all of our victims
went to Suzuno first,

18:18.806 --> 18:20.140
got turned down,

18:20.224 --> 18:20.849
and then were
specifically directed

18:20.933 --> 18:23.852
to these sketchy fucks.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.729
And then we know
what happened next.

18:31.860 --> 18:33.612
- Chase it.

18:41.912 --> 18:43.038
- This way please.

18:47.125 --> 18:48.210
- Hai.

18:49.419 --> 18:53.507
Excuse me, your appointment
has arrived.

19:06.436 --> 19:08.355
Go ahead.

19:08.438 --> 19:09.523
- Sugita-san.

19:09.898 --> 19:11.024
- Mr. Adelstein, yes?

19:11.108 --> 19:12.776
- Yes. Uh...

19:12.860 --> 19:15.863
Thank you so much
for taking the time

19:15.946 --> 19:21.410
at your work to meet with me.

19:21.493 --> 19:22.411
- No problem.

19:22.870 --> 19:23.704
- Um, I'm comfortable

19:23.787 --> 19:25.539
speaking English,
if you please.

19:25.622 --> 19:27.124
- Oh. Oh, wait.
You don't like my Japanese?

19:27.207 --> 19:28.709
- Oh, no, no. I loved it.
- Just joking.

19:30.335 --> 19:32.129
Well, the view here
is amazing, huh?

19:32.212 --> 19:36.550
- Yes, it is.
- Great office and--oh.

19:36.633 --> 19:39.803
- Please.
- Thank you. Thank you.

19:39.887 --> 19:43.807
- So you are
an American journalist.

19:43.891 --> 19:45.183
- I'm American
and a journalist. Yes.

19:45.267 --> 19:48.562
- You're with, uh,
"The Wall Street Journal"?

19:48.645 --> 19:50.564
- No. I wish.

19:50.647 --> 19:52.941
I'm--I'm just doing
some research today

19:53.025 --> 19:55.402
for a colleague of mine
who's doing a st--

19:55.485 --> 19:56.945
sorry, I forgot.

19:57.029 --> 20:00.490
Uh, do you mind if I, uh,
record our conversation?

20:00.574 --> 20:03.118
- Oh, not at all.
- Thank you.

20:03.201 --> 20:05.662
Uh, the story
is about the growing

20:05.746 --> 20:07.581
personal debt crisis in Tokyo.

20:07.664 --> 20:10.042
- Yes. It is truly a problem.

20:10.125 --> 20:11.543
- But the reason
why I wanted to

20:11.627 --> 20:13.503
speak to you specifically,
Mr. Sugita,

20:13.587 --> 20:16.798
is because Suzuno Financial's
profitability

20:16.882 --> 20:19.843
has remained admirably stable

20:19.927 --> 20:21.762
during this tough time,
has it not?

20:21.845 --> 20:24.139
- Yes, it has.
- And your record

20:24.222 --> 20:27.851
for avoiding customer
loan default is very low.

20:27.935 --> 20:29.436
- Correct.

20:29.519 --> 20:32.105
We are very discerning
in our client selection.

20:32.189 --> 20:34.107
- I see. I see.

20:34.191 --> 20:36.318
Oh, uh,
can I show you something?

20:36.401 --> 20:37.194
- Sure.

20:56.421 --> 20:57.923
Who are these people?

20:58.006 --> 20:59.841
- You should know.

20:59.925 --> 21:04.471
Your very discerning bank
turned them down for loans here

21:04.554 --> 21:05.847
and sent them elsewhere,

21:05.931 --> 21:08.183
to this place,

21:08.266 --> 21:11.144
where they were driven
to suicide

21:11.228 --> 21:13.647
to collect
on a life insurance policy.

21:13.730 --> 21:16.233
- I am not
responsible for this.

21:19.403 --> 21:21.613
- You have a lovely family.

21:24.282 --> 21:25.283
So did they.

21:35.752 --> 21:39.423
I know this wasn't your idea.

21:40.465 --> 21:42.134
I know you were forced into it.

21:45.095 --> 21:46.138
Right?

21:49.099 --> 21:50.267
I'm gonna write the story

21:50.350 --> 21:51.268
with or without your help.

21:53.854 --> 21:55.772
Give me Tozawa...

21:57.149 --> 21:59.860
And I'll leave you out of it.

22:11.163 --> 22:13.957
He confirmed everything--

22:14.041 --> 22:17.002
that he was the one funneling
clients to the predatory lender

22:17.085 --> 22:18.378
and that there was
yakuza involvement.

22:18.462 --> 22:20.172
- He went on record?

22:20.255 --> 22:21.923
- Well, not on the record
because he said

22:22.007 --> 22:23.967
he has wire transactions
incriminating Tozawa.

22:24.051 --> 22:26.094
He's gonna give them to me
as soon as he gets off work.

22:26.178 --> 22:28.055
- Where?
- At his house.

22:28.138 --> 22:29.598
- What's the address?

22:29.681 --> 22:32.350
I'm sending someone
with a document scanner.

22:32.434 --> 22:34.728
- I can do this myself.
- Obviously not.

22:34.811 --> 22:37.981
You shouldn't have let him
out of your sight, Jake.

22:38.065 --> 22:41.109
Let's hope
he hasn't changed his mind.

22:41.193 --> 22:43.361
Give me the address now.

22:47.908 --> 22:50.077
- You have to watch the heat.

22:50.160 --> 22:51.328
So the fabric doesn't burn.
See?

22:51.661 --> 22:52.079
Try it.

22:52.162 --> 22:53.705
- Okay.

23:10.388 --> 23:11.348
- Go away.

23:12.349 --> 23:13.892
- Didn't I tell you what would
happen if you lied to me again?

23:18.021 --> 23:20.398
I just talked to Duke.

23:21.066 --> 23:22.943
You never straightened out
that gaijin bitch,

23:23.026 --> 23:25.654
despite what you told me.

23:26.029 --> 23:29.491
The boss wants to see you.

23:29.574 --> 23:31.118
So you can answer
for your life failure.

23:44.005 --> 23:45.298
On your knees.

24:52.824 --> 24:56.786
- A man must take
responsibility for his actions.

25:05.587 --> 25:07.422
Did you really think
you could take...

25:10.175 --> 25:12.302
what was mine?

25:15.138 --> 25:16.223
Kume.

25:30.487 --> 25:32.364
- You're so desperate
to hold on to what's yours,

25:32.447 --> 25:33.615
you've lost sight
of the future.

25:36.034 --> 25:37.702
- What could Tozawa
have possibly offered you

25:37.786 --> 25:39.204
to make you betray me?

25:39.746 --> 25:41.206
- Hope!

25:42.374 --> 25:43.750
You cling to these worthless
traditions

25:43.833 --> 25:45.835
while Tozawa innovates!
Pushes boundaries!

25:46.586 --> 25:48.630
He's got plane routes
right now

25:48.713 --> 25:49.881
bringing in shabu
from North Korea!

25:51.132 --> 25:54.761
- He sells poison,
so we should sell poison?

25:55.303 --> 25:57.264
- Then how are we meant
to survive?

25:58.014 --> 25:59.099
I watched while you let others

25:59.182 --> 26:01.434
reach into your pocket
and take what's yours!

26:02.269 --> 26:04.437
And why?
For "the righteous path"?

26:04.521 --> 26:06.606
The "path"
will make us extinct!

26:08.525 --> 26:10.026
What am I supposed to do?

26:12.862 --> 26:13.780
- Jump.

26:13.863 --> 26:15.115
- Do it with your own hand!

26:24.249 --> 26:26.042
- No.

26:30.005 --> 26:32.382
He will.

26:36.845 --> 26:38.555
Kill him.

26:42.225 --> 26:43.310
Kill him.

27:41.618 --> 27:43.036
- It's all right,
little brother.

27:44.496 --> 27:46.956
You were never made for this.

28:13.775 --> 28:18.613
- Are you a part
of Chihara-kai... or not?

28:22.242 --> 28:23.660
Choice is yours.

29:13.334 --> 29:15.336
- With respect,

29:16.421 --> 29:18.173
I told you we should have
paused our arrangement!

29:18.965 --> 29:19.632
Now the press is involved!

29:24.804 --> 29:27.348
What are we supposed
to do now?!

29:27.974 --> 29:29.225
- There is no "we."

29:30.643 --> 29:31.853
This is your problem,

29:33.229 --> 29:34.314
Sugita.

29:36.149 --> 29:37.942
- Then...

29:38.818 --> 29:41.946
what do you expect me to do?

29:43.198 --> 29:46.075
- I expect you to do
what is necessary.

29:47.702 --> 29:48.870
And immediately.

30:10.016 --> 30:10.725
Mm.

30:12.852 --> 30:13.686
Excellent tea.

30:18.191 --> 30:19.526
Could you excuse us?

30:20.568 --> 30:22.111
- Of course.

30:24.531 --> 30:27.534
- Thank you for calling me
first.

30:28.451 --> 30:29.494
So...

30:30.620 --> 30:32.455
what do you plan to do
with Kume's body?

30:33.289 --> 30:38.127
- You know our policy
regarding traitors.

30:40.296 --> 30:42.382
- Dismemberment. Castration.

30:45.301 --> 30:47.178
You do that,
it won't look like a suicide.

30:48.137 --> 30:49.847
The police will be arriving
soon.

30:50.974 --> 30:51.683
If they find a body
that's been tampered with,

30:51.766 --> 30:54.352
they'll have to investigate.

30:54.811 --> 30:57.063
You don't want that.

30:58.314 --> 31:00.775
The traitor was exposed,
justice was exacted.

31:01.484 --> 31:03.194
An escalation of hostilities
would be bad for everyone.

31:03.861 --> 31:04.904
Especially you.

31:07.865 --> 31:08.783
- Especially me?

31:13.788 --> 31:18.876
- Perhaps Chihara-kai could've
crushed Tozawa ten years ago.

31:21.754 --> 31:25.341
Be smart about this.
Not reckless.

31:27.760 --> 31:29.470
Can I depend
on your cooperation?

31:50.325 --> 31:51.826
- No answer.

31:51.909 --> 31:53.703
- He said to meet him
at this time, so...

31:57.123 --> 31:58.458
- Hey, wait.

32:00.001 --> 32:02.378
- The door's open.

32:03.129 --> 32:04.589
Hello?

32:04.672 --> 32:07.008
Sugita-san? It's Adelstein
from the "Meicho."

32:08.092 --> 32:09.218
- Anyone home?

32:09.761 --> 32:11.596
- Excuse me.

32:12.221 --> 32:14.182
- Excuse me.

32:16.059 --> 32:17.935
- There's music playing.

32:20.063 --> 32:20.980
I'm coming in!

32:23.066 --> 32:25.568
- Sugita-san?

32:25.652 --> 32:26.861
Not here.

32:26.944 --> 32:27.945
- No, he's not here.

32:28.029 --> 32:29.280
- He's upstairs maybe.

32:29.364 --> 32:30.698
- No, you can't
just go up there.

32:30.782 --> 32:32.116
Excuse me. It's
Adelstein from the "Meicho!"

32:35.286 --> 32:36.621
- Sugita-san?

32:37.246 --> 32:38.831
There he is.

32:38.915 --> 32:40.875
Sorry,
I heard the music, so I--

32:49.092 --> 32:49.842
Sugita-san?

32:53.012 --> 32:54.931
Sugita-san--
- Don't.

32:55.390 --> 32:57.892
Danger. Don't Touch.

33:11.072 --> 33:13.658
We should call the police.

33:20.039 --> 33:21.082
- He left a note.

33:41.894 --> 33:43.896
Fuck. Fuck!

33:49.152 --> 33:53.114
- Are you my greeter?

33:53.656 --> 33:56.743
- I regret to tell you that
Tozawa-san cannot make time

33:56.826 --> 33:59.996
in his busy schedule
to speak with you today.

34:01.122 --> 34:03.499
- Then you will do me the
courtesy of relaying a message.

34:06.335 --> 34:09.672
An associate of yours, Kume,
is dead.

34:13.593 --> 34:16.053
There will be no war between
you and the Chihara-kai.

34:16.888 --> 34:20.183
- That may be a message
better delivered to Ishida.

34:20.516 --> 34:25.521
- I delivered it to him myself.
And he in is agreement.

34:28.691 --> 34:31.444
- I will convey this
information to Tozawa-san.

34:32.820 --> 34:36.365
We will consider your request
carefully.

34:38.576 --> 34:38.993
- You do that.

35:04.018 --> 35:04.185
- Would you like... this...

35:38.177 --> 35:39.011
- Forgive me.

35:39.804 --> 35:40.137
It is all my fault.

35:43.683 --> 35:49.647
Yesterday, you were so strong
and hard... it make me sore...

35:51.065 --> 35:53.067
so now I was timid
and cautious.

35:58.281 --> 36:00.908
Thank you for your patience.

36:05.037 --> 36:06.038
- You'll do better next time,
Misaki.

36:25.474 --> 36:27.643
- Fucking suicide note--

36:29.645 --> 36:32.648
he took responsibility
for everything.

36:32.732 --> 36:35.568
He let Tozawa completely
off the fuckin' hook!

36:35.651 --> 36:37.361
- Lower your voice.

36:39.238 --> 36:41.282
- Why?

36:41.365 --> 36:43.868
Why would he do that?
Why would he do that?

36:43.951 --> 36:46.370
- He killed himself
because of us.

36:46.454 --> 36:48.080
It's our fault.

36:49.790 --> 36:53.085
And you worry about your story?

36:53.169 --> 36:55.421
- Dude, this is our job.

36:56.672 --> 36:59.008
Job. Okay.

37:00.426 --> 37:03.512
You carry the stupid scanner
back to the press club.

37:17.443 --> 37:18.527
- Step back.

37:18.611 --> 37:20.279
- Excuse me. That's my house.

37:20.363 --> 37:21.239
- Are you a family member?

37:21.739 --> 37:23.532
- Yes.

37:23.616 --> 37:24.450
- Go ahead.

37:36.545 --> 37:37.004
- Ukai is here.

37:37.546 --> 37:40.591
- Fine.
I'll be there in a minute.

37:51.394 --> 37:53.813
- My Master!

38:02.279 --> 38:04.281
I have written
about your greatness.

38:08.577 --> 38:09.912
My latest article.

38:11.622 --> 38:12.957
I hope you will appreciate it.

38:24.719 --> 38:25.803
- Go.

38:26.929 --> 38:27.847
- Excuse me.

38:27.930 --> 38:28.180
- Hai.

38:33.644 --> 38:36.731
- So. What news from
the honorable detective?

38:37.398 --> 38:38.899
- Our friend
in the Chihara-kai...

38:38.983 --> 38:40.192
It appears he's been--

38:42.236 --> 38:43.279
- Discovered?

38:45.031 --> 38:46.198
Unfortunate.

38:47.116 --> 38:47.408
Should we expect a response?

38:47.867 --> 38:49.118
- No.

38:49.785 --> 38:54.707
If Katagiri is to be believed,
Ishida has agreed to a truce.

38:55.124 --> 38:56.375
- Without reprisal?

38:56.792 --> 38:57.835
- Yes.

39:00.963 --> 39:02.298
- He is weak.

39:07.928 --> 39:09.346
- A greedy banker runs
a loan sharking scheme,

39:09.430 --> 39:10.890
he gets found out,
and kills himself.

39:10.973 --> 39:11.849
That's the story.

39:11.932 --> 39:13.392
- Not the whole story.

39:13.476 --> 39:15.394
We know the yakuza
are behind this.

39:15.978 --> 39:19.106
I just need a little more time
to find the proof.

39:19.190 --> 39:22.068
- There is no time! What's news
today is shit tomorrow!

39:22.151 --> 39:24.278
- With respect, Jake is right,
Baku-san.

39:24.820 --> 39:27.615
If we go to print now,
we miss the greater conspiracy.

39:27.990 --> 39:29.366
- The only conspiracy
I see here is between

39:29.450 --> 39:31.160
the two of you imbeciles,
teaming up against me.

39:31.494 --> 39:32.411
We run with what we have!

39:34.705 --> 39:36.332
- Jake. Jake! Jake...

39:36.415 --> 39:38.834
if you go in there now,
you'll say something

39:38.918 --> 39:40.586
that gives him no choice
but to fire you.

39:40.669 --> 39:44.381
And from what I've seen today,
that would be a loss.

39:44.465 --> 39:46.258
For all of us.

39:49.678 --> 39:51.931
- The cops already raided
the lender and shut 'em down.

39:52.014 --> 39:53.557
- I know.

39:53.641 --> 39:56.769
- So another one'll pop up
and take its place.

39:56.852 --> 39:59.772
But it's a great start, right?

40:02.525 --> 40:04.151
- It's good.

40:04.235 --> 40:05.152
- Maybe.

40:05.236 --> 40:07.154
I mean, maybe it was good

40:07.238 --> 40:08.823
until they hacked
all the balls off of it.

40:08.906 --> 40:11.117
So everything
about Tozawa's gone.

40:11.200 --> 40:13.452
- And that surprises you?

40:19.041 --> 40:20.960
My father...

40:21.043 --> 40:26.173
He was...very Japanese.

40:27.842 --> 40:29.510
- "Very Japanese"?

40:31.178 --> 40:33.097
- There are degrees.

40:34.765 --> 40:36.851
He owned a little market.

40:37.518 --> 40:39.311
He stocked his shelves,
kept his books.

40:41.689 --> 40:43.440
Had a small wooden Buddha

40:43.524 --> 40:44.567
on the counter
where he met his customers.

40:44.900 --> 40:49.780
And on this figurine was carved:
"Not knowing... is Buddha."

40:52.908 --> 40:55.369
It means,
not knowing is peaceful.

40:58.289 --> 41:00.457
- So ignorance is bliss?

41:00.541 --> 41:04.336
- I did not say
it worked for me.

41:04.420 --> 41:08.174
- You know,
I don't think not knowing

41:08.257 --> 41:10.593
is really part
of our job description.

41:19.268 --> 41:22.855
- My father just wants me
to come home.

41:22.938 --> 41:27.026
- Is it wrong for a father to
want to be close to his child?

41:28.277 --> 41:30.529
- No. Of course not.

41:30.613 --> 41:35.326
It's just, you know,
I did my time there.

41:35.409 --> 41:37.203
I spent time with them,

41:37.286 --> 41:40.831
and I'm here now
doing my own thing.

41:40.915 --> 41:44.460
And the only thing
he says to me is, "Come home."

41:44.543 --> 41:45.711
Maybe he could just be
a little bit proud of me,

41:45.794 --> 41:47.504
you know?

41:50.966 --> 41:52.927
- Last time we spoke,

41:53.010 --> 41:54.929
you had come to a dead end
with the investigation.

41:55.012 --> 41:58.057
I'm curious.

41:58.140 --> 42:00.059
How did you crack it?

42:04.355 --> 42:10.069
- I guess it was just your
standard reporter's ingenuity.

42:26.502 --> 42:28.545
- You know...

42:31.590 --> 42:33.759
Sugita-san,

42:33.842 --> 42:36.220
the banker
who killed himself...

42:40.808 --> 42:42.977
I can't--
I really can't help but think

42:43.060 --> 42:45.062
that he wouldn't have done it

42:45.145 --> 42:47.815
if only
I hadn't confronted him.

42:49.567 --> 42:54.113
- The banker--
he dug his own grave.

42:55.531 --> 42:57.574
That kind of thinking
will drive you mad.

43:01.078 --> 43:04.248
Tonight, get yourself
good and drunk.

43:05.457 --> 43:08.127
You'll feel better tomorrow.

43:53.172 --> 43:55.007
- Oh, thanks.

43:55.090 --> 43:58.302
Rough day?

43:58.385 --> 44:00.095
Me too.

44:06.935 --> 44:10.314
That problem your
boss had, did you work it out?

44:13.609 --> 44:16.362
- Problem solved.

44:45.724 --> 44:48.143
- Thank you.

44:55.651 --> 44:57.236
Hi.

44:57.319 --> 44:58.779
Care for a bottle?
- Yeah. Yeah.

44:58.862 --> 45:01.323
Set the table, please?

45:01.407 --> 45:02.991
- Come on.

45:10.082 --> 45:11.834
- I can't believe I'm actually
defending America,

45:11.917 --> 45:14.336
but at least in America
they have a thing

45:14.420 --> 45:16.463
called fucking investigative
journalism, right?

45:16.547 --> 45:18.507
- Mm-hmm. Right.

45:20.676 --> 45:21.927
- You know, here, you can pay

45:22.010 --> 45:23.429
for someone
to diaper and spank you.

45:23.512 --> 45:24.596
- Mm-hmm.

45:24.680 --> 45:26.932
- But if you rock the boat...

45:27.015 --> 45:28.767
Don't fucking rock the boat.

45:29.852 --> 45:32.563
Nah, fuck it.
Let's rock this boat.

45:32.646 --> 45:33.814
Let's rock this boat.

45:33.897 --> 45:35.065
Let's see what falls out,
right?

45:35.149 --> 45:35.607
- Okay.

45:39.361 --> 45:40.821
- What?

45:42.322 --> 45:45.576
What? Am I boring you?
- No.

45:45.659 --> 45:47.119
- What is--I spent half

45:47.202 --> 45:48.787
a week's fucking salary
on this bottle.

45:48.871 --> 45:50.497
Do you realize that?

45:50.581 --> 45:52.249
Am I entitled to your
undivided attention or not?

45:52.332 --> 45:54.209
- You had a bad day.
- Yes, I did.

45:54.293 --> 45:55.919
- You wanna talk as friends?
- Yeah.

45:56.003 --> 45:57.629
- I--we can do that.
- Okay.

45:57.713 --> 46:00.048
- Sure. Not during work hours.

46:01.383 --> 46:03.385
Pay attention.
This is my job.

46:03.469 --> 46:06.346
Respect that or leave.

46:15.272 --> 46:17.858
- Got something for me?

46:20.819 --> 46:21.987
- What is it?

46:22.070 --> 46:23.155
- Nothing. A fan letter.

46:23.238 --> 46:24.823
- Ooh. Arigato.

46:24.907 --> 46:25.574
- And take care of table five.

46:25.657 --> 46:27.326
- Can I get some water?

46:27.409 --> 46:28.994
- Hai.

46:29.077 --> 46:31.622
- Hey. Come.

46:32.915 --> 46:34.833
- Oh, good.
You're pulling my arm now.

46:37.503 --> 46:39.838
You boys are so needy tonight.

46:39.922 --> 46:41.757
- You need to take me serious.

46:42.674 --> 46:44.218
There are rules!

46:44.301 --> 46:46.178
- What are the rules?

46:46.261 --> 46:47.554
I would love to know
the fuckin' rules.

46:47.638 --> 46:50.516
- Everybody pays.

46:51.850 --> 46:54.228
Everybody pays!

46:55.896 --> 46:57.022
Oi.

46:57.606 --> 46:59.399
Oi!

47:13.330 --> 47:16.583
- I paid. We good now?

47:32.015 --> 47:33.058
- I'm sorry. I don't--

47:54.162 --> 47:58.041
- Good evening, Jack.
- Josh. Jake.

47:58.125 --> 48:01.128
Jake. My name is Jake.
- Oh, okay.

48:01.211 --> 48:02.254
What's your name?

48:02.337 --> 48:04.631
- Polina.

48:05.549 --> 48:06.550
- Nice to meet you.

48:06.633 --> 48:07.134
- Nice
to meet you.

48:09.011 --> 48:11.805
You--you wait for Samantha?

48:12.973 --> 48:14.766
She left. Back door.
With the yak.

48:18.353 --> 48:19.896
- They left?
- Mm.

48:22.566 --> 48:26.278
I do not meet my boyfriend
for two hours or so.

48:26.361 --> 48:28.989
You want to see
my favorite place in all Tokyo?

48:29.948 --> 48:34.119
I'll change.
Meet me outside.

48:35.037 --> 48:36.455
Five minutes.

50:21.810 --> 50:23.437
- This is not fair.

50:35.073 --> 50:37.951
It's special, no?

50:38.034 --> 50:39.578
- Yeah.

50:41.747 --> 50:44.541
- Do you know these ones?

50:44.624 --> 50:47.836
- No.
- They're the best.

50:47.919 --> 50:51.173
They're little chocolate
biscuits shaped like mushroom.

50:51.256 --> 50:53.175
I hate real mushrooms.

50:53.258 --> 50:56.636
Back home, they put mushrooms
in everything.

50:56.720 --> 51:00.891
When Akira first give me these,
I said, "No way."

51:00.974 --> 51:04.895
But he had me taste,
and now they're my favorite.

51:07.105 --> 51:08.607
Have some.
- Mmm.

51:13.528 --> 51:14.529
- What's that mean?

51:14.613 --> 51:17.199
- "Love comes
through the stomach."

51:18.700 --> 51:22.662
What's your star sign?

51:22.746 --> 51:25.499
- Um...I don't know.

51:25.582 --> 51:29.461
- You don't know?

51:29.544 --> 51:31.338
Come on. You know.

51:31.421 --> 51:33.715
Well, when is your birthday?

51:33.799 --> 51:35.884
- December 8th.

51:40.555 --> 51:41.139
What?

51:42.724 --> 51:45.352
- Samantha is Taurus.

51:45.435 --> 51:48.146
Very practical, very stubborn.

51:48.230 --> 51:51.274
You are Sagittarius
with the big dreams,

51:51.358 --> 51:53.109
shooting your arrows.

51:53.193 --> 51:55.779
It will never work.

51:56.905 --> 51:59.241
It's not right time anyway.

51:59.324 --> 52:02.452
She has--she has lots of shit
to deal with.

52:03.912 --> 52:05.997
Wait. What is time?

52:06.081 --> 52:08.208
- It's30.
- Oh, shit.

52:08.291 --> 52:09.668
I must go. I'm sorry.

52:09.751 --> 52:12.045
- You have to go?

52:12.128 --> 52:15.507
Can--can we get something
to eat first?

52:15.590 --> 52:17.717
- Jake, we will not be fucking.

52:18.760 --> 52:21.429
You will find right woman.

52:21.513 --> 52:23.139
But she must be fire sign.

52:23.223 --> 52:25.892
Then you be happy, huh?

52:29.729 --> 52:31.606
You are very cute.

52:38.989 --> 52:41.867
- I can't figure you out.

52:41.950 --> 52:45.078
- What do you mean?

52:45.161 --> 52:46.162
- Okay.

52:46.246 --> 52:51.042
I grew up in a pretty
religious family.

52:51.126 --> 52:54.212
- Really?
- Mm.

52:54.296 --> 52:57.340
My dad...

52:57.424 --> 53:01.344
held a sort of high position
in our local parish.

53:01.428 --> 53:03.221
We never missed a service.

53:03.305 --> 53:07.851
We'd sit there, back straight,
eyes front.

53:09.144 --> 53:11.229
If we made a sound,
my dad would go crazy.

53:11.313 --> 53:15.650
But I actually
didn't mind going.

53:15.734 --> 53:18.236
Because there were these times

53:18.320 --> 53:25.118
that you felt this...
hum inside you.

53:27.495 --> 53:34.002
Every part of you just...
alive for a moment.

53:35.629 --> 53:39.716
A sense of connection.

53:39.799 --> 53:42.677
And I haven't felt that
in a while.

53:43.887 --> 53:46.932
And then you.

53:47.015 --> 53:50.352
You made me feel that.

53:52.228 --> 53:54.731
That sounds weird.

54:00.362 --> 54:04.866
- I feel connection
when I'm with you.

54:07.661 --> 54:09.663
- Thank you.

54:20.382 --> 54:22.133
- You okay?

54:29.432 --> 54:33.645
- A friend of mine...

54:33.728 --> 54:35.981
he died today.

54:40.735 --> 54:42.195
- Close friend?

54:42.278 --> 54:44.155
- More than that.

54:46.825 --> 54:48.243
He was my aniki.

54:50.745 --> 54:51.997
- Sorry.

54:52.080 --> 54:55.000
- I know I am not like him.

54:57.002 --> 55:00.380
But if I continue like this..

55:00.463 --> 55:06.261
I'm afraid I will...

55:06.344 --> 55:08.138
end like him.

55:09.431 --> 55:12.350
- If you wanna change
your life, change your life.

55:14.436 --> 55:16.896
It's really, really hard.

55:20.316 --> 55:22.235
But I did it.

55:22.318 --> 55:28.575
I made mistakes,
but I got out of my cage.

55:29.951 --> 55:31.953
You can too.

56:03.902 --> 56:05.820
- Come in.

56:12.494 --> 56:14.496
- What is that?

56:14.579 --> 56:15.914
- Money.

56:18.333 --> 56:22.087
Fair price for you to go away.

56:24.339 --> 56:26.216
- Look, you've been paid
to find me.

56:26.299 --> 56:28.176
I'm paying you
to say that you couldn't.

56:28.259 --> 56:29.886
Everybody wins.

56:29.969 --> 56:32.889
- I'm not interested
in your money.

56:32.972 --> 56:35.225
If you had not left
our dinner so abruptly--

56:35.308 --> 56:38.311
- Well, if it isn't money,
then what the fuck do you want?

56:38.394 --> 56:42.357
- I want
what you will not sell.

56:45.068 --> 56:46.778
- No fucking way.

56:46.861 --> 56:49.531
- Not now.

56:49.614 --> 56:52.283
You stink
like cigarettes and sweat.

56:52.367 --> 56:55.703
I want you showered and rested.

56:55.787 --> 56:58.289
So you'll meet here
tomorrow night

56:58.373 --> 57:01.292
for our first session.

57:01.376 --> 57:04.129
As long as I continue
to get what I want,

57:04.212 --> 57:06.923
you will get what you want.

57:07.006 --> 57:08.800
Everybody wins.

57:08.883 --> 57:11.136
- Fuck you, you fucking sicko.

57:11.219 --> 57:11.970
Fuckin' who comes up with--

57:12.053 --> 57:14.347
- Samantha!

57:15.723 --> 57:18.977
One call, and you'll be back
in the States

57:19.060 --> 57:21.855
before the week is over.

57:21.938 --> 57:27.360
You have an opportunity here
to make this all go away.
