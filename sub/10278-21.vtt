00:04.239 --> 00:05.786
E. R.

00:05.787 --> 00:07.087
Previously on E. R.

00:07.088 --> 00:10.172
You should know you're being
considered for chief resident next year.

00:10.173 --> 00:11.615
I'm pregnant.

00:11.616 --> 00:14.121
- Roger's out of town.
- Yeah, is he ever around?

00:14.122 --> 00:16.181
We haven't been getting along
too well lately.

00:16.181 --> 00:18.876
- What do you want, Kerry?
- I thought you might be hungry.

00:18.877 --> 00:22.536
No. No, I'm not, and I have
a ton of work to do. So...

00:23.139 --> 00:25.955
Your mother was just transported
to her commitment hearing.

00:25.956 --> 00:27.235
Aren't you supposed to testify?

00:27.236 --> 00:29.391
Mrs. Wyczenski is released
on her own recognizance.

00:29.592 --> 00:32.305
- She needs hospitalization!
- I'm not debating it with you, Miss.

00:32.305 --> 00:33.673
Why do you think I'm here?

00:33.674 --> 00:37.111
Because you know she needs your help,
even if she doesn't want it.

00:37.212 --> 00:39.800
I just hope you didn't order
from that Thai place again.

00:42.731 --> 00:45.305
E. R. 7x21 "WHERE THE HEART IS"

00:46.277 --> 00:50.322
Very good. My turn now? My turn?

00:50.490 --> 00:51.771
Did he finish his breakfast?

00:51.950 --> 00:53.943
No, but I got him
to eat some strawberries.

00:54.119 --> 00:57.405
Cleo, he's supposed to have hot cereal
before he gets treats.

00:57.581 --> 01:02.327
These are just as nutritious,
if not more so. And they' re yummy too.

01:02.545 --> 01:05.119
Tell the babysitter to make sure
he has a good lunch.

01:05.465 --> 01:07.873
- I cancelled the sitter.
- What?

01:08.218 --> 01:10.294
I'm off today.

01:10.470 --> 01:12.878
Cleo, Reece needs a lot of attention.

01:13.057 --> 01:15.630
Peter, I'm a pediatrician.

01:16.435 --> 01:18.262
All right.

01:18.438 --> 01:21.309
Hey, see you, man.

01:21.942 --> 01:25.311
Say, "See you at the game, Daddy. "

01:25.529 --> 01:27.818
What? I didn't say
I was gonna play tonight.

01:27.990 --> 01:30.777
You're not. You're going
to sit in the bleachers with Reece.

01:30.952 --> 01:33.194
Come on. It'll be fun.
I'm playing first base.

01:33.371 --> 01:36.574
- He doesn't have a jacket here.
- I'll go to Carla's and pick one up.

01:36.750 --> 01:39.751
- No. You know what? I'll do it.
- I can go.

01:39.920 --> 01:41.794
I said I'd go.

01:42.506 --> 01:44.333
- I'm on the cell.
- Okay.

01:44.508 --> 01:46.964
Want to play trains?

01:49.931 --> 01:53.217
God, I slept so great. And the dreams.

01:53.393 --> 01:56.762
It's so wonderful to be able
to dream again.

01:56.939 --> 02:00.106
Obviously, the therapy sessions
are helping, and these walks.

02:00.276 --> 02:02.185
Good.

02:02.361 --> 02:05.197
You know what? You don't
have to stay home all the time.

02:05.365 --> 02:09.693
- I'm sure Luka would love to see you.
- It's only been a couple of weeks.

02:09.870 --> 02:12.408
- He's a good man.
- Yeah.

02:12.790 --> 02:15.162
- So is your friend John.
- Yeah.

02:15.334 --> 02:17.541
Must be fun to have two men
interested in you.

02:17.712 --> 02:19.586
- Mom!
- I've had men interested in me...

02:19.756 --> 02:23.706
...all my life, you know.
Just not good ones.

02:23.885 --> 02:27.052
Actually, I think your father
was the best compared to all the rest.

02:27.222 --> 02:31.434
- But I certainly blew that.
- Think we should head home?

02:32.853 --> 02:37.350
- Why is it we can't talk?
- We're talking.

02:37.567 --> 02:40.237
No. I mean about important things.

02:40.404 --> 02:43.191
You know, Dr. Legaspi says
it might be easier...

02:43.407 --> 02:45.779
...for us to do it
in a therapy session.

02:45.951 --> 02:48.110
- Do what?
- Talk.

02:48.287 --> 02:50.660
She wants you to come
to one of the sessions.

02:50.832 --> 02:52.872
- I don't think so.
- I want you to come too.

02:53.043 --> 02:55.616
- You could come during lunch break.
- I'm gonna head back.

02:55.796 --> 02:58.750
- Abby, will you come?
- I'm gonna go to work.

02:58.924 --> 03:01.415
Come on. Just think about it.
All right?

03:03.000 --> 03:09.074

03:12.397 --> 03:15.102
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:15.276 --> 03:17.233
Can I help you?

03:18.112 --> 03:20.520
I was just dropping something off.

03:21.032 --> 03:24.282
For Kim? She's in the shower.

03:24.786 --> 03:27.277
I can give her that if you want.

03:28.207 --> 03:31.410
No, thanks. I'll pass it on later.

03:31.585 --> 03:35.251
- You're welcome to come in and wait.
- No. That won't be necessary. Thanks.

03:35.423 --> 03:37.629
Give me your name.
I can tell her you stopped by.

03:38.676 --> 03:40.550
E. R.

04:29.399 --> 04:33.148
Dr. Greene? Yeah, sorry.
I need to get some lab slips.

04:33.320 --> 04:35.646
Oh, sure. Sorry.

04:35.823 --> 04:37.982
- Baby keeping you up, huh?
- Not really.

04:38.159 --> 04:42.204
She slept for six hours last night,
ten minutes at a time.

04:42.914 --> 04:44.907
I've been in the hall for five minutes.

04:45.083 --> 04:47.539
- I can't find a doc to save my life.
- What do you got?

04:47.711 --> 04:51.840
Seven-year-old boy tried to put out a fire
in a can. Thickness burns on both hands.

04:52.008 --> 04:53.170
- Need some help?
- Sure.

04:53.343 --> 04:54.422
- BP, 110/60.
- Get it out!

04:54.594 --> 04:57.085
- Is that him? He sounds agitated.
- You could say that.

04:57.264 --> 04:59.719
I'm Dr. Mark Greene.
You want to tell me your name?

04:59.891 --> 05:00.923
- No!
- It's Ben.

05:01.101 --> 05:03.771
- I want this out of my nose!
- That's to help you breathe.

05:03.938 --> 05:06.061
- It's only for a little while.
- You his mother?

05:06.232 --> 05:09.352
- Neighbor. He's a friend of my son's.
- No answer at the kid's house.

05:09.527 --> 05:12.813
- Good air entry. Both lungs are clear.
- Any way to contact the parents?

05:12.989 --> 05:15.741
- He just has a father. I left a message.
- I want to go home!

05:15.909 --> 05:17.107
- Let's go.
- Get it out!

05:17.286 --> 05:19.907
What do you see me in?
A Beemer or a Porsche?

05:20.081 --> 05:24.161
- Most of the time I see you walking.
- Okay. You can forget about a ride.

05:24.335 --> 05:27.171
Carter, buy or lease?

05:27.339 --> 05:30.625
- Dr. Dave behind the wheel, huh?
- This is topaz-blue metallic.

05:30.801 --> 05:33.506
- What do you think?
- I think it's out of your price range.

05:33.679 --> 05:35.838
I'm moonlighting
at a doc in the box, my friend.

05:36.015 --> 05:39.052
- Three months, I got my down payment.
- Then what happens?

05:39.227 --> 05:40.425
Fake my own death.

05:40.603 --> 05:43.391
You playing ball tonight?
We'll kick Sanitation's ass.

05:43.565 --> 05:46.139
- Maybe.
- Neck pain in Curtain 1 is asking for you.

05:46.318 --> 05:48.311
I'll be right there.
Black or sand interior?

05:48.487 --> 05:51.607
I hope you're not keeping patients
waiting while you shop for a car.

05:51.782 --> 05:53.941
No, no, no.
I'm all over that board, chief.

05:54.118 --> 05:56.526
Don't worry. He still has
to pass his driver's test.

05:56.704 --> 06:00.288
- Dr. Carter, can I speak to you a minute?
- Sure.

06:03.462 --> 06:05.206
- Morning.
- Morning, Dr. Chen.

06:05.381 --> 06:07.670
- Hey.
- Deb.

06:08.718 --> 06:13.843
- Could you excuse us a minute?
- Sure.

06:15.934 --> 06:19.979
Your application was intercepted
by administration.

06:20.981 --> 06:22.855
Processing time has improved.

06:23.025 --> 06:26.525
You realize you're still
in a probationary period?

06:26.696 --> 06:30.564
Which will be completed by the time the
chief resident's slot needs to be filled.

06:30.742 --> 06:32.402
Why do you want to do this?

06:32.578 --> 06:37.074
It gets me closer to a junior faculty
position. Looks good on the CV.

06:37.249 --> 06:40.453
No. I mean why risk
compromising your recovery...

06:40.628 --> 06:43.879
...by taking on a new
and very demanding position?

06:44.049 --> 06:46.125
I guess I don't see it as a risk.

06:46.301 --> 06:48.971
Having teaching
and administrative responsibilities...

06:49.179 --> 06:51.753
- ... along with your clinical shifts?
- I'm in the program.

06:51.932 --> 06:55.468
I've been managing my stress.
I got myself back up to speed.

06:55.645 --> 06:58.350
Carter, you'd all but give up
nights and weekends.

06:58.523 --> 07:03.316
- It's a tremendous amount of work.
- I'm ready for it.

07:03.487 --> 07:05.729
We can't just gloss over
what happened last year.

07:05.906 --> 07:08.694
- Neither can the committee.
- You're returning my application?

07:08.868 --> 07:12.451
Did you honestly think
that you'd make the first cut?

07:14.582 --> 07:16.409
- Get your hands off me!
- He's all yours.

07:16.585 --> 07:19.123
- Here. Let me take a closer look.
- Don't touch me!

07:19.296 --> 07:22.665
- It'll feel better in a second. I promise.
- Mild erythema, no blistering.

07:22.842 --> 07:25.511
- It hurts! Stop!
- Let the doctor finish. Okay?

07:25.678 --> 07:27.470
- You want to tell me what happened?
- No!

07:27.639 --> 07:29.928
- I think he lit the fire himself.
- Shut up!

07:30.100 --> 07:32.425
- Why don't we get a burn tray for Ben?
- Sure.

07:32.602 --> 07:35.176
- He's home by himself a lot.
- I said shut up!

07:35.355 --> 07:38.357
I just wish he would stop
hanging around my son.

07:39.527 --> 07:42.943
Hey. Good news. Our second baseman
has the stomach flu.

07:43.114 --> 07:46.199
- Luka, I'm not playing softball.
- Well, you don't have to be great.

07:46.368 --> 07:49.037
- It's just for fun.
- Actually, I happen to play very well.

07:49.204 --> 07:51.577
- So go. It'll be good for you.
- I can't.

07:51.749 --> 07:55.498
One night away from your mother
isn't gonna do anything.

07:57.797 --> 07:59.706
I miss you.

08:04.221 --> 08:06.297
Have a good time tonight.

08:07.057 --> 08:09.596
Conni, can you dispense some
ketoconazole to Exam 1?

08:09.769 --> 08:11.180
- Sure.
- Thanks.

08:11.354 --> 08:13.512
- Emergency ringworm, huh?
- Pretty hard to avoid.

08:13.690 --> 08:17.604
- The guy has 40 cats.
- You might want to give him a flea bath.

08:19.321 --> 08:22.108
So, what was going on
between you and Weaver?

08:22.741 --> 08:24.366
Not much.

08:24.577 --> 08:28.242
Except for her denying my application
for chief resident.

08:28.414 --> 08:31.618
Apparently, I still have
a scarlet A on my chest.

08:31.793 --> 08:34.628
Wow. I'm really sorry, John.

08:34.922 --> 08:38.587
- Don't be. It makes you a shoo-in.
- There are other candidates.

08:38.759 --> 08:42.378
Not really. I guess
congratulations are in order.

08:42.554 --> 08:44.429
- Congratulations. You deserve it.
- Thanks.

08:44.599 --> 08:47.434
- Not as much as me, but...
- Yeah, right.

08:48.270 --> 08:51.022
- Hey.
- It's on the chair.

08:52.232 --> 08:54.902
- I put a cap in there too.
- Good.

08:56.821 --> 08:59.277
Just stay a while,
and have some coffee, maybe.

08:59.449 --> 09:02.616
You know what? I need to get back.

09:04.496 --> 09:07.830
- You all right?
- Yeah.

09:11.629 --> 09:16.790
Roger moved out a few days ago.

09:17.469 --> 09:19.462
I'll be okay.

09:20.055 --> 09:21.715
Are you sure?

09:25.936 --> 09:30.148
It would have saved us both a lot of
trouble if we had just stayed together.

09:30.316 --> 09:33.104
You know, Peter?

09:35.489 --> 09:40.032
Would have been better
for Reece, anyway.

09:44.874 --> 09:47.448
He said he never loved me.

09:49.880 --> 09:53.214
Carla, people say a lot of things
they don't mean when they're fighting.

09:53.550 --> 09:58.972
I don't know. I think it's true.

09:59.140 --> 10:02.058
Maybe we never had anything.

10:05.313 --> 10:07.472
It will work itself out.

10:10.861 --> 10:12.819
You and I...

10:16.367 --> 10:18.989
...we had something.

10:20.747 --> 10:22.870
Didn't we, Peter?

10:29.799 --> 10:34.545
- Sometimes I think we still do.
- I'm not doing this, Carla.

10:34.721 --> 10:36.714
Peter, don't go.

10:39.560 --> 10:41.932
- Yeah?
- That's a nice hello.

10:42.104 --> 10:43.183
Cleo.

10:43.356 --> 10:45.894
- Did you make it to Carla's yet?
- A few minutes ago.

10:46.067 --> 10:48.737
Hey, how about picking up deli
on the way home?

10:48.903 --> 10:51.858
- We can have a picnic on the field.
- Sure. Yeah. Whatever.

10:52.532 --> 10:54.572
- You all right?
- Yeah, why?

10:55.035 --> 10:56.613
I don't know. You sound funny.

10:56.787 --> 10:58.910
- Is she giving you a hard time again?
- Who?

10:59.081 --> 11:02.949
- Carla.
- You know, I'm sorry. I'm just in a rush.

11:03.837 --> 11:05.331
- Reece, wait!
- What's he doing?

11:05.505 --> 11:08.341
Hang on, Peter. Oh, my God!

11:08.508 --> 11:11.510
- Cleo, what happened?
- Is there something wrong?

11:11.679 --> 11:13.588
Read it and weep.

11:13.764 --> 11:16.302
No bleeding, no hydrocephalus,
no midline shift...

11:16.517 --> 11:18.759
...no subarachnoid hemorrhage.

11:19.187 --> 11:21.892
Okay. Do an LP.
You got a chronic neck pain patient.

11:22.065 --> 11:24.853
Wait. You want me to give
a Demerol junkie a spinal tap?

11:25.027 --> 11:27.020
CTs are only 95 percent
sensitive, Dave.

11:27.196 --> 11:31.360
What are you two? A tag team?
I know what I'm doing.

11:31.701 --> 11:34.868
- Oh, to be a junior resident again.
- Not.

11:35.038 --> 11:38.158
- Dr. Chen, can I see you?
- Sure.

11:38.750 --> 11:41.787
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

11:43.088 --> 11:46.090
Chief residency
is typically an extra year...

11:46.259 --> 11:48.797
...completing the emergency
medicine program.

11:48.970 --> 11:54.807
In rare cases, we make an exception
and allow a senior to be in the position.

11:54.977 --> 11:57.931
- Right.
- Unfortunately, your maternity leave...

11:58.105 --> 12:01.889
...put you three months behind
on shifts and procedures...

12:02.068 --> 12:05.022
...keeping you just shy
of senior status.

12:05.196 --> 12:07.818
But I'm in the process
of making that up.

12:07.991 --> 12:10.826
Yes, but the academic year
ends June 30.

12:10.994 --> 12:14.909
And I'm planning on working every
weekend and every holiday until then.

12:15.082 --> 12:19.661
Hospital policy actively discourages
work weeks in excess of 60 hours.

12:19.838 --> 12:22.293
And given that limitation,
it doesn't seem feasible...

12:22.465 --> 12:25.383
...that you'd succeed
in making the deadline.

12:27.972 --> 12:32.883
And as a result, I'm afraid you won't be
a candidate for chief resident this year.

12:38.859 --> 12:40.898
I'm sorry. I know it doesn't seem fair.

12:41.069 --> 12:45.198
Wait. This is completely sexist
and discriminatory!

12:45.366 --> 12:47.738
- Excuse me?
- You all but offered me this position...

12:47.910 --> 12:50.318
- ... prior to my pregnancy.
- Yes. And at that time...

12:50.497 --> 12:52.703
...I anticipated your completion
of the program.

12:52.874 --> 12:57.750
I had a baby. I think I made a choice
that was both legal and responsible.

12:57.963 --> 12:58.994
Of course you did.

12:59.173 --> 13:02.209
I made a sacrifice, largely
for the sake of my career...

13:02.385 --> 13:04.958
...and becoming chief resident
is a huge part of that.

13:05.179 --> 13:06.888
- Jing-Mei.
- I'm a good doctor.

13:07.057 --> 13:10.260
I've offered to make up for lost time.
And I didn't screw up.

13:10.435 --> 13:14.054
Under the circumstances,
I think I deserve a chance.

13:14.398 --> 13:17.352
I appreciate your thoughts.
And I'll take them under advisement.

13:17.568 --> 13:19.608
I'd hope you would.

13:25.744 --> 13:28.449
- What is that stuff?
- Thermazine cream.

13:28.622 --> 13:31.576
Make you feel better, and it helps
keep it from getting infected.

13:31.751 --> 13:34.076
- My fingers feel funny.
- How?

13:34.253 --> 13:36.579
- I can't feel the ends.
- No?

13:36.756 --> 13:40.256
- Maybe with this hand.
- Hey!

13:41.678 --> 13:44.300
- You know, that's not funny.
- Everything okay in here?

13:44.473 --> 13:47.474
Yeah. Little Ben here
just tried to grab me.

13:47.643 --> 13:50.313
- She was hurting my hand.
- Oh, yeah? Let me take a look.

13:50.480 --> 13:52.769
He says he can't feel his fingers.

13:54.693 --> 13:58.607
Here, let me see your hand.
What's wrong?

13:58.781 --> 14:01.023
It hurts there, huh? Did you fall?

14:01.200 --> 14:02.480
I don't know. Maybe.

14:02.952 --> 14:05.443
Let's get an x-ray
of this left hand just in case.

14:05.621 --> 14:07.282
Hey, hey, hey.

14:07.457 --> 14:09.450
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Settle down.

14:09.626 --> 14:10.657
- My head.
- Yeah.

14:10.836 --> 14:12.579
Okay, let me take a look at your head.

14:12.796 --> 14:15.168
Okay. Do you remember
when you hurt your ear?

14:15.466 --> 14:19.416
- Huh?
- You got a pretty bad bruise back here.

14:21.139 --> 14:24.804
Six-disk CD changer, tinted windows.
That's- Hello?

14:24.976 --> 14:28.346
- There's an ACL tear in Exam 2.
- Yeah. I was on my way, chief.

14:28.522 --> 14:32.354
Yeah? Dr. Malucci, you're a resident.
You can't afford a car!

14:32.526 --> 14:34.649
What was all that about?

14:35.446 --> 14:37.819
Misguided sense of job security.

14:37.991 --> 14:40.743
Lot of that going around.
I heard you came by the house.

14:40.911 --> 14:43.746
Yeah, I was in the area,
and on a whim, I thought I'd stop by.

14:43.914 --> 14:47.532
Lori said that you had a letter,
but that you didn't leave it.

14:49.045 --> 14:51.417
It just didn't seem like
the timing was very good.

14:51.589 --> 14:54.163
I can see how
you would feel that way.

14:54.843 --> 14:57.001
How long have you two
been seeing each other?

14:57.179 --> 14:58.887
Not long.

15:00.349 --> 15:02.472
I'm sorry. I know this
must be painful for you.

15:02.643 --> 15:04.968
- No, I'm fine. I mean, it's fine.
- Okay.

15:05.146 --> 15:06.688
Kerry?

15:07.941 --> 15:09.601
- You take care of yourself.
- You too.

15:09.776 --> 15:11.733
I've got an AMA form
I need you to cosign.

15:12.028 --> 15:15.195
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.
- You didn't.

15:16.075 --> 15:17.902
You two okay?

15:19.036 --> 15:20.828
- Dr. Legaspi.
- Hi.

15:20.997 --> 15:24.247
Hi. I was wondering if you could tell me
how it's going with my mother.

15:24.417 --> 15:27.205
I'm sorry, Abby. I really can't discuss
her therapy with you.

15:27.379 --> 15:31.163
Even if she said you said I should
attend one of her sessions?

15:31.341 --> 15:34.462
I think that it would be
mutually beneficial. Yeah.

15:34.637 --> 15:36.760
Okay.

15:36.931 --> 15:39.718
Could you give me a little bit
of an idea what to expect?

15:39.893 --> 15:42.348
Well, it's not an ambush.

15:42.521 --> 15:47.230
I'm sorry. It's just that she lies a lot.

15:47.610 --> 15:49.437
We meet at 1.

15:52.406 --> 15:54.945
You don't have to come
if you don't want to.

15:58.288 --> 16:01.574
Still hurt? I'm sorry.

16:01.750 --> 16:06.080
Oh, baby! Look at you.

16:08.091 --> 16:11.923
- It's all right. Your mommy's here.
- How bad is it?

16:12.095 --> 16:14.930
He's got a fracture
of the fifth metacarpal.

16:15.098 --> 16:17.720
- His hand is broken?
- He's gonna have to wear a cast.

16:17.893 --> 16:20.764
- How is he gonna sign?
- He's not.

16:20.938 --> 16:25.102
All right. It's okay. Mommy's here.

16:25.276 --> 16:29.191
I'm sorry. I just looked away
for a second, and he was at the piano.

16:29.364 --> 16:31.986
Listen, why don't you give us
a few minutes, okay?

16:32.159 --> 16:33.737
Of course.

16:36.622 --> 16:41.119
- Hey. This is your fault, you know.
- I am so sorry.

16:41.294 --> 16:43.453
- Reece is not like other children.
- I know.

16:43.630 --> 16:45.753
Then how come you didn't stay
in his eye line?

16:45.924 --> 16:48.594
It was an accident, Carla.
I don't know what else to say.

16:48.761 --> 16:51.133
I feel horrible about this.

16:51.305 --> 16:54.306
- I want you to stay away from my son.
- Carla, can we just-?

16:54.475 --> 16:56.801
What would have happened
if you turned away again?

16:56.978 --> 17:00.394
What would have happened if Reece
had run out into the street? He is deaf!

17:00.565 --> 17:02.642
You cannot just call him!
You have to be with-!

17:02.818 --> 17:05.226
- All right, Carla.
- I don't want to see this bitch...

17:05.404 --> 17:07.646
- I said back off!
- ... anywhere near Reece again!

17:07.823 --> 17:09.233
Go.

17:28.012 --> 17:29.293
- Hey.
- Hi.

17:29.472 --> 17:32.676
Hit and run. ETA's five minutes.

17:34.228 --> 17:39.139
Kind of like waiting for thunder
after the lightning strikes.

17:46.366 --> 17:50.067
Dr. Legaspi and I...

17:52.039 --> 17:53.996
It ended.

17:55.752 --> 17:57.626
I'm sorry.

18:01.007 --> 18:03.084
Something changed?

18:04.219 --> 18:05.762
Yes.

18:09.267 --> 18:11.306
Do you love her?

18:17.317 --> 18:20.271
Then you should go forward, not back.

18:29.330 --> 18:32.248
Fifty-year-old male changing
a blowout got sideswiped by a car.

18:32.417 --> 18:34.909
LOC at the scene, but started
coming around in the rig.

18:35.087 --> 18:37.839
- Obvious femur fracture. Vitals?
- Initially, 90 palp.

18:38.007 --> 18:41.341
BP's up to 115/70
after 1500 cc's of saline.

18:41.511 --> 18:44.927
- Sir, can you tell us your name?
- Jim Vogel. God! My legs!

18:45.098 --> 18:48.467
- Trauma 2. Go.
- Serial crits, type and cross times 4.

18:48.644 --> 18:51.135
We got one more, doc.
She won't come out.

18:51.313 --> 18:53.639
Restrained, but got a forehead lac
from the mirror.

18:53.816 --> 18:55.939
Brother says she's
developmentally challenged.

18:56.110 --> 18:57.818
- What's her name?
- Won't say.

18:58.071 --> 18:59.898
I'm not sure she understands
the question.

19:00.073 --> 19:03.323
Hi. I'm Dr. Weaver.
Can you tell me who you are?

19:03.493 --> 19:05.652
- Jim's sister.
- Okay.

19:05.829 --> 19:08.784
We need to make sure you're not
seriously hurt. Can you come out?

19:08.958 --> 19:10.417
- I want to go again.
- I'm sorry?

19:10.585 --> 19:13.123
- On a ride. It's fun.
- She's been smiling like this...

19:13.296 --> 19:15.585
...ever since I got her in the rig.

19:15.840 --> 19:16.920
Here we go.

19:18.301 --> 19:22.169
Crepitations on the right, with decreased
air entry. I need that chest tube.

19:22.348 --> 19:25.017
- Tachy at 110. I'll set it up.
- God, I can't stand it.

19:25.226 --> 19:28.144
- What do you got so far?
- Pneumo on the right, unstable pelvis...

19:28.312 --> 19:30.186
- ... fractured right hip.
- Where's Bonnie?

19:30.440 --> 19:32.065
- Is that your sister's name?
- Yeah.

19:32.234 --> 19:35.401
Another doctor's checking. She appears
to have only minor injuries.

19:35.571 --> 19:40.910
Does Bonnie have any medical conditions
other than her developmental delay?

19:41.077 --> 19:44.280
- No. She's always been healthy.
- Okay.

20:02.225 --> 20:06.804
- Sorry I'm late.
- It's fine. We're glad you could join us.

20:15.615 --> 20:17.109
- Hi.
- Hi.

20:17.951 --> 20:21.154
Please know that we both understand
how awkward it can be...

20:21.330 --> 20:25.162
- ... to step into someone else's therapy.
- It's okay. I'm fine.

20:26.460 --> 20:29.711
- Maggie, do you want to continue?
- Sure.

20:31.216 --> 20:36.886
So Dr. Legaspi and I
were talking about...

20:37.055 --> 20:42.014
We talked about a lot. But we were
talking about ways I could stay healthy.

20:42.186 --> 20:47.561
You know, how to position myself
to get it together, keep on track. And...

20:48.944 --> 20:54.921
...part of that is that
I've decided to go home.

20:57.036 --> 21:01.081
- Have you talked to Eric?
- No, not Florida.

21:01.249 --> 21:05.413
"Home" home.
I'm going back to Minnesota.

21:13.304 --> 21:16.389
You haven't been to Minneapolis
in 15 years, Mom.

21:16.557 --> 21:19.891
I know that. I know. I haven't.
But I grew up there.

21:20.061 --> 21:24.523
And I feel like I belong there. I've got
a little bit of family and some friends.

21:24.692 --> 21:27.859
- What friends?
- Gina.

21:28.029 --> 21:30.021
You remember Gina?

21:30.198 --> 21:32.903
Well, I'm gonna stay with her.
She has a spare room.

21:33.076 --> 21:36.694
She thinks she could get me a job in the
convalescent hospital where she works.

21:36.872 --> 21:39.908
Really? When did you arrange all this?

21:40.084 --> 21:43.667
Last week. I... She accepted
a collect phone call from me.

21:43.838 --> 21:48.500
She was glad to hear from me, Abby.
She was glad to talk to me.

21:50.887 --> 21:56.013
Anyway, I'll save enough money,
and I'll get a place of my own.

21:56.268 --> 22:00.218
- A place of your own?
- Yes. A place of my own...

22:00.398 --> 22:04.016
...with no roommates, no men.
Just me. Maybe a cat.

22:04.194 --> 22:08.940
- A cat? That would be a great pet. Cat.
- Are you reacting to your mother's plans?

22:09.116 --> 22:12.034
I'm not reacting.

22:13.704 --> 22:15.911
I'm just...

22:16.124 --> 22:20.371
- Just what?
- Nothing.

22:21.713 --> 22:26.755
Abby, I can't stay here in Chicago.
I don't want to go to Florida.

22:27.261 --> 22:30.464
It's just too easy for me
to be a drain on you and-

22:30.640 --> 22:33.760
You know, I think we're
way past that at this point.

22:34.185 --> 22:36.059
What is your objection
to your mother going home?

22:36.271 --> 22:39.474
Nothing.
It's very romantic.

22:39.650 --> 22:42.485
You're not happy about it?

22:43.779 --> 22:47.824
I don't know what you want me to say.
Yippee, she's going home?

22:47.992 --> 22:51.825
Fabulous, that solves
all the problems? What?

22:51.997 --> 22:54.914
- Then what is your solution?
- I don't have a solution.

22:55.083 --> 22:57.954
I don't... I don't think
there is a solution.

22:58.128 --> 23:01.462
To talk about this as if it were some
life-management problem...

23:01.632 --> 23:04.468
...that you can plan
your way out of, well, it's absurd.

23:04.636 --> 23:09.215
- Then what do you suggest?
- I don't know.

23:13.520 --> 23:18.147
You know what? I don't know.
I don't know.

23:18.317 --> 23:22.814
So I guess you're right. You have
to do something, Mom. Good luck.

23:23.406 --> 23:26.324
- So, what? You're leaving?
- You wanted to tell me. You told me.

23:26.493 --> 23:31.571
- Well, I'm not going for a week or so.
- Okay, great. See you later.

23:38.924 --> 23:41.166
- When did Ben Fossen's father arrive?
- While ago.

23:41.343 --> 23:43.252
Someone should have told me.

23:45.347 --> 23:48.183
- Hi. I'm Dr. Greene.
- Derek Fossen.

23:48.351 --> 23:51.767
- Thanks for taking care of him.
- Sure. Can we talk outside?

23:51.938 --> 23:54.856
Yeah. We'll be right outside, Ben.

23:57.361 --> 23:59.567
Mrs. Shayatovich told me
about the fire.

23:59.738 --> 24:02.859
- Your neighbor?
- Yeah. He's always getting into trouble.

24:03.034 --> 24:06.035
- Yeah?
- Yeah. His mom's out of the picture.

24:06.204 --> 24:09.407
- And I think it makes him act out.
- Well, those burns will heal.

24:09.583 --> 24:11.042
Good. Thanks.

24:11.209 --> 24:13.831
I'm just waiting on the psychiatrist
to come talk to Ben.

24:14.004 --> 24:15.712
Psychiatrist? Why?

24:15.881 --> 24:19.167
We found some unusual bruising
on your son, Mr. Fossen.

24:19.385 --> 24:20.714
Do you know about that?

24:20.887 --> 24:24.007
- No.
- You've never noticed the bruises?

24:24.182 --> 24:26.852
- Well, he gets into scrapes at school.
- Fights?

24:27.019 --> 24:29.724
- Yeah.
- Any serious injuries?

24:29.897 --> 24:32.020
No more than any kid.

24:32.400 --> 24:36.065
- I'm sure he'll tell that to the doctor.
- Look, he doesn't need a psychiatrist.

24:36.237 --> 24:40.318
- And I have to get back to work. So...
- I know. I know. This won't take long.

24:48.918 --> 24:51.623
We're supposed to be at the park.

24:51.796 --> 24:54.334
Is that where you were driving?

24:54.591 --> 24:57.082
Two to 4:00 we go to the park.

24:58.220 --> 25:00.509
But we had a crash.

25:02.016 --> 25:07.093
- I know.
- My parents had a crash.

25:09.107 --> 25:13.816
- When's Jimmy coming back?
- I don't know.

25:16.574 --> 25:20.441
Did they die in the crash?
Your parents?

25:22.831 --> 25:26.531
So, what do you do
in the park, Bonnie?

25:26.918 --> 25:28.828
The slide.

25:29.797 --> 25:31.077
Anything else?

25:31.257 --> 25:34.211
The swing. You know,
Jimmy pushes me.

25:34.385 --> 25:36.592
Not too high, though.

25:37.096 --> 25:38.804
Do you have
any other brothers or sisters?

25:39.015 --> 25:40.640
Nope.

25:42.602 --> 25:45.010
- C-spine is clear.
- No perihepatic fluid...

25:45.189 --> 25:47.395
- ... but I can't see the spleen.
- Where's Bonnie?

25:47.566 --> 25:50.140
- She's fine. She's getting some sutures.
- Thank God.

25:50.319 --> 25:52.989
Minimal blood in the Thora-Seal,
but his repeat crit is 34.

25:53.156 --> 25:55.279
- He's bleeding from somewhere.
- Probably here.

25:55.450 --> 25:57.324
- What's wrong?
- You shattered your pelvis.

25:57.494 --> 25:59.036
- That'll heal though, right?
- Yes.

25:59.204 --> 26:01.992
But the bone may be cutting
an artery. We need a CAT scan...

26:02.166 --> 26:04.159
...to see where the bleeding
is coming from.

26:04.335 --> 26:08.415
Lydia, call Radiology. Tell them we need
abdomen and pelvis with contrast.

26:08.590 --> 26:10.832
- Will I need surgery?
- We'll know after the scan.

26:11.009 --> 26:13.168
- I can't be laid up. My sister...
- Yes, I know.

26:13.345 --> 26:16.880
We'll try to stop the bleeding by injecting
a clotting agent into the artery.

26:17.057 --> 26:20.640
- BP's down to 95/60.
- Okay. Hang another two units.

26:20.811 --> 26:24.181
- And call for six type-specific.
- Okay. We need to go now.

26:25.525 --> 26:29.025
I'm gonna bring Carla home, and then
go by your place and pick up his stuff.

26:29.196 --> 26:30.774
Fine.

26:30.948 --> 26:33.521
Listen, I told you. Reece,
he needs special attention.

26:33.701 --> 26:37.319
- Peter, I know that. I made a mistake.
- All right.

26:37.497 --> 26:40.451
You know, but you're acting
like I deliberately let him get hurt.

26:40.625 --> 26:43.377
I'm sorry about what happened.
Carla gets upset.

26:43.545 --> 26:45.870
Well, I don't get called
a bitch by anyone.

26:46.048 --> 26:48.456
Bonnie, where are you
supposed to be?

26:48.634 --> 26:51.469
- Finding my brother.
- Okay.

26:51.721 --> 26:55.470
- Jing-Mei?
- You're supposed to stay in that room.

26:55.642 --> 26:57.884
I have to tell my brother
what I want for dinner.

26:58.061 --> 27:00.731
- Why is he back?
- He dropped his pressure upstairs.

27:00.898 --> 27:03.768
- There he is. Jimmy!
- BP's only 80 palp.

27:03.943 --> 27:07.312
Hang another two units on the infuser.
What did the scan show?

27:07.488 --> 27:09.611
He crashed before we even
got him on the table.

27:09.782 --> 27:12.238
- Dr. Weaver?
- Open a peritoneal lavage kit.

27:12.410 --> 27:14.569
We'll go supra-umbilical.
Lydia, drop an NG.

27:14.746 --> 27:17.582
- My sister has special needs.
- Let's worry about you right now.

27:17.791 --> 27:19.998
- HemoCue is ten.
- Okay, we need central access.

27:20.169 --> 27:22.956
- Somebody get Dr. Chen!
- There's no one else but me.

27:23.131 --> 27:25.752
Okay, Jim.
Dr. Chen, put in subclavian.

27:25.925 --> 27:28.084
- Got it.
- Pressure's down to 70.

27:28.261 --> 27:32.094
- Pulse ox dropped to 84.
- Jim? Jim?

27:32.266 --> 27:34.057
He's not breathing.
Give me a 9-0 tube.

27:34.226 --> 27:37.311
- Bag him on 100 percent.
- Get in that line!

27:38.397 --> 27:40.604
Luka, if the tap is positive,
he goes to the O.R.

27:40.775 --> 27:43.349
If not, maybe we can embolize
the pelvic bleeders.

27:43.528 --> 27:45.320
- I'm in.
- Squeeze all the blood you can.

27:45.489 --> 27:46.864
Call for eight more units.

27:47.032 --> 27:50.199
- Well, the hand's okay.
- Look at the wrist.

27:50.953 --> 27:53.954
- Is that a Colles' fracture?
- Ben says he never hurt his wrist.

27:54.123 --> 27:57.956
- Maybe he's too young to remember it.
- His dad doesn't remember, either.

27:58.128 --> 28:01.082
- How did your talk go with him?
- Well, he's a pretty hostile kid.

28:01.256 --> 28:04.293
- Clammed up when Dad showed up.
- Yeah. It was hard to talk to him.

28:04.468 --> 28:07.339
His dad was standing outside
the whole time, and Ben knew it.

28:07.513 --> 28:09.636
- He's terrified of him.
- I think he is.

28:09.807 --> 28:12.643
But he says there's no violence
in the home.

28:12.811 --> 28:15.598
You saw that bruising.
That's him getting pulled by his ear.

28:15.772 --> 28:17.812
He says he doesn't remember
how it happened.

28:17.983 --> 28:20.653
You don't forget a broken bone
or bruising like that.

28:20.819 --> 28:22.943
- Lost his pulse.
- He'll never make it to Angio.

28:23.114 --> 28:25.901
Pump in that blood.
Order two units of FFP. He's in V-fib!

28:26.075 --> 28:30.821
- Starting compressions.
- Okay, charge to 200. Clear.

28:32.708 --> 28:34.499
- V-fib.
- Thoracotomy tray.

28:34.668 --> 28:38.334
- It's blunt trauma.
- It's an isolated pelvic injury. Clear.

28:39.340 --> 28:42.045
- Lydia, close the blinds to Suture.
- Still in fib.

28:42.218 --> 28:45.837
Three-sixty. Clear.

28:50.144 --> 28:51.389
I'm starving.

28:51.562 --> 28:53.638
We could pick something up
from Doc Magoo's.

28:53.814 --> 28:55.938
If I were smart, I would
have gone to lunch...

28:56.109 --> 28:59.478
...instead of getting reamed
by my mother and Legaspi.

28:59.654 --> 29:02.027
I don't get it. A week ago
she wanted her committed.

29:02.199 --> 29:05.034
- And now she's completely on her side.
- It's not about sides.

29:05.202 --> 29:08.239
Well, it felt like it was.
All of a sudden it was all about me.

29:08.414 --> 29:12.911
What was my problem that I couldn't get
onboard with this plan she figured out?

29:13.086 --> 29:16.704
- Would any plan have made you happy?
- No.

29:16.882 --> 29:19.634
When was the last time
your mom was in therapy?

29:19.802 --> 29:23.052
- I don't know. Like ten years ago.
- That's different.

29:23.222 --> 29:25.131
- Yeah.
- So you got a choice.

29:25.308 --> 29:27.550
You can either hope
that she makes it this time...

29:27.727 --> 29:29.554
- ... or give up.
- Right.

29:29.729 --> 29:34.024
- Doesn't seem like you want to do that.
- I don't know what I want to do.

29:35.068 --> 29:37.524
- Weaver dropped a bomb this morning.
- What happened?

29:37.696 --> 29:40.982
- She bagged me for chief resident.
- Really?

29:41.159 --> 29:43.732
Apparently my rehab
has caught up to me.

29:43.912 --> 29:47.862
- Oh, no. I'm sorry.
- It's not your fault.

29:48.041 --> 29:49.584
Not exactly.

29:50.002 --> 29:54.913
I guess part of facing the problem is
accepting some people won't get over it.

29:55.091 --> 29:58.092
- I'm sorry, John.
- Me too.

29:59.345 --> 30:00.590
For you.

30:03.767 --> 30:05.392
Get a 10-pack of platelets.

30:05.561 --> 30:07.553
- Heart's not filling.
- Units 9 and 10 are in.

30:07.730 --> 30:09.769
- Hold compressions.
- Still in fib.

30:09.940 --> 30:11.221
- Vasopressin?
- Onboard.

30:11.400 --> 30:13.726
Another 100 of lido.
I'll take the internal paddles.

30:13.903 --> 30:15.563
- How long has he been down?
-35 minutes.

30:15.739 --> 30:18.111
- Charge to 20.
- Jimmy?

30:18.283 --> 30:21.118
- Bonnie, you have to go outside.
- Clear.

30:22.079 --> 30:24.653
- I don't like that.
- Charge again.

30:24.832 --> 30:26.741
- Lydia?
- I don't want you to do that.

30:27.335 --> 30:29.791
- We're trying to help him.
- But it hurts him.

30:29.963 --> 30:31.955
- Clear.
- It hurts him.

30:33.633 --> 30:34.879
Charge again.

30:35.177 --> 30:36.422
Clear!

30:39.932 --> 30:42.470
Heart's empty. Asystole.

30:42.643 --> 30:44.885
Should we try pacing him?

30:46.564 --> 30:49.269
Okay. That's it.

30:49.443 --> 30:52.942
Time of death 17: 10.

30:53.113 --> 30:55.236
- Can you close the chest up?
- Yeah.

30:55.408 --> 30:58.777
Clean him up but leave the tubes
in for the coroner.

30:58.953 --> 31:01.029
I'll tell the sister.

31:08.964 --> 31:11.752
- Want me to come with you?
- Yeah.

31:20.352 --> 31:24.017
I'm tired of it here. I think
Jimmy and me should go home.

31:24.189 --> 31:26.313
The doctors are going
to talk to you now.

31:26.484 --> 31:28.690
- Hi, Bonnie.
- Hi.

31:29.153 --> 31:32.523
Bonnie, this is your brother's doctor.

31:32.699 --> 31:34.277
Is he ready to go?

31:34.451 --> 31:36.527
Bonnie, Jim was very hurt.

31:36.703 --> 31:39.539
And he couldn't recover
from his injuries.

31:40.624 --> 31:43.542
- Cover?
- Get better.

31:44.921 --> 31:47.839
Your brother died, Bonnie.
I'm sorry.

31:48.800 --> 31:50.876
Do you understand?

31:51.720 --> 31:54.638
Like Ernie. He died.

31:55.808 --> 31:58.762
- Who's Ernie?
- My hamster.

31:58.936 --> 32:01.262
We put him in a box.

32:01.731 --> 32:03.356
Okay.

32:03.525 --> 32:06.609
Well, like your hamster,
Jim won't be with you anymore.

32:06.778 --> 32:10.563
I got a new hamster.
His name is Ernie too.

32:11.867 --> 32:13.860
You know how
your parents went away?

32:14.078 --> 32:15.323
In the crash?

32:17.207 --> 32:20.243
Jimmy went away like that too.

32:22.879 --> 32:26.664
- But it's library night.
- I know.

32:26.842 --> 32:28.965
And I get scared at night.

32:29.887 --> 32:33.221
Bonnie, you're gonna
have to be very brave.

32:35.435 --> 32:37.807
Where's Jimmy?

32:41.317 --> 32:42.645
There you are.

32:42.818 --> 32:45.274
- Hi.
- Do you have a minute?

32:45.446 --> 32:47.605
Sure. Am I in trouble or something?

32:47.782 --> 32:51.198
I don't usually do this.
But I think it's important.

32:51.369 --> 32:53.943
I think you need to give your mom
one more chance.

32:54.122 --> 32:57.658
- Didn't I do that today?
- You started to. And then you ran away.

32:57.835 --> 33:00.505
Maybe because I've heard it
about 100 times before.

33:00.671 --> 33:03.626
- I think this time's different.
- Do you? Why?

33:03.800 --> 33:06.837
Well, she hasn't been willing
to go to therapy for 10 years.

33:07.012 --> 33:10.132
- Now she's embracing it.
- I'd love to believe that meant something.

33:10.766 --> 33:13.684
Don't let your mom go away
without being able to talk to you.

33:13.853 --> 33:17.685
- That won't make either of you happy.
- I don't think "happy" is on the table.

33:18.274 --> 33:21.478
- Why not?
- Look, I'm not in therapy.

33:23.488 --> 33:25.066
Fair enough.

33:26.283 --> 33:28.490
But I'll consider it.

33:29.662 --> 33:33.197
- What you said.
- Okay.

33:34.209 --> 33:36.367
- She has the mind of a 7-year-old.
- And no other relatives?

33:36.544 --> 33:38.870
Her brother was her only family.

33:39.047 --> 33:41.835
I've tried ARC, Protection,
and Advocacy. No luck.

33:42.009 --> 33:45.176
The facilities are all full. She'll have
to take a place at a group home.

33:45.346 --> 33:47.505
No. I don't want her sent
to a place like that.

33:47.682 --> 33:49.425
They've got four or five people
in every room.

33:49.601 --> 33:51.807
Unless you take her home,
this is all I can offer.

33:51.978 --> 33:55.513
Okay. But I don't want her
sleeping on the couch or on the floor.

33:55.691 --> 33:57.565
Well, I'll pass that along.

33:57.735 --> 34:00.356
You'll have to get her there.
They're too backed up to pick her up.

34:00.529 --> 34:02.688
- Oh, come on!
- I'm just the messenger.

34:02.865 --> 34:05.273
- Look, in time she'll adjust.
- Adele, this stinks.

34:05.452 --> 34:08.702
They have got job-training programs.
Hopefully she'll learn a skill.

34:08.871 --> 34:10.995
- Adele, ready?
- Yeah.

34:11.166 --> 34:12.542
Sorry.

34:18.507 --> 34:21.543
It's about time.
Ben has not eaten since noon.

34:21.719 --> 34:23.344
- We'll get him something.
- We'd rather go.

34:23.513 --> 34:25.839
This is Adele Neuman.
She's a social worker.

34:26.016 --> 34:27.724
- Hi. Hi, Ben.
- Hi.

34:27.893 --> 34:30.847
My kid does not need
any more counseling or whatever.

34:31.063 --> 34:33.270
I'm afraid Ben's gonna
have to stay for a few days.

34:33.440 --> 34:35.931
- What?
- We're taking him into custody.

34:36.110 --> 34:37.569
What are you talking about?

34:37.737 --> 34:40.145
I'm not comfortable
with the bruising I found.

34:40.324 --> 34:42.233
God forbid you're not comfortable.

34:42.409 --> 34:45.409
I also found evidence of a broken wrist
which neither of you mentioned.

34:45.579 --> 34:47.406
I told you that he fights!

34:47.581 --> 34:49.242
- Would you tell them?
- I fight a lot.

34:49.417 --> 34:51.623
If that's true, then you'll get
to go home in three days.

34:51.795 --> 34:54.120
- But now I need you to come with me.
- I don't want to.

34:54.297 --> 34:56.456
You're not doing this to us!

34:56.632 --> 34:57.914
Security!

34:59.011 --> 35:02.096
- Get your hands off of me!
- You don't have a choice here.

35:02.264 --> 35:05.515
- If you think I hurt my kid, you're crazy.
- I suggest you contact a lawyer.

35:05.685 --> 35:07.974
- To sue your ass!
- It's for your protection.

35:08.146 --> 35:10.388
I don't want to!
Let me stay with him!

35:10.565 --> 35:11.846
- I'm sorry.
- Leave him alone!

35:12.025 --> 35:14.481
- No! Dad! Please!
- You bastard!

35:14.653 --> 35:17.109
- Please! Dad!
- Why are you doing this to us?

35:17.281 --> 35:19.155
Dad!

35:23.496 --> 35:25.205
- Hi.
- Hi.

35:25.373 --> 35:29.585
Guess what? The super finally fixed
the stove fan. So I cooked dinner.

35:29.753 --> 35:33.123
Cucumber soup, a little salmon.

35:33.299 --> 35:36.466
- Why don't you invite Luka to dinner?
- He's playing softball.

35:36.928 --> 35:40.796
- That sounds like fun. Are you gonna go?
- I don't want to play.

35:45.145 --> 35:49.475
The reason why I ran out today
like that is because it's just...

35:50.777 --> 35:53.612
It's scary to hope too much,
you know?

35:54.572 --> 35:57.657
Yeah, I know.

35:59.161 --> 36:01.368
I know I might not make it.

36:01.539 --> 36:03.033
But, Abby...

36:04.166 --> 36:07.185
...something happened to me in that
ICU room.

36:07.259 --> 36:10.750
I realized I don't want to die.

36:11.925 --> 36:13.752
And more than that...

36:13.927 --> 36:18.673
...I don't want my little girl to watch me
die. I can't do that to you. Not ever.

36:19.225 --> 36:22.309
That's what I wanted
to tell you today.

36:23.605 --> 36:28.896
I'm gonna handle my life.
And I want you to get on with yours.

36:33.365 --> 36:34.397
Okay.

36:36.494 --> 36:39.744
- You can't put your life on hold anymore.
- It's not on hold.

36:39.914 --> 36:42.240
You won't play softball
with your boyfriend.

36:42.417 --> 36:45.869
- So? I don't want to play.
- Stop sitting things out, Abby.

36:46.046 --> 36:47.956
I don't.

36:48.132 --> 36:49.377
Yes, you do.

36:49.550 --> 36:53.382
You can't use me as the reason
for not doing the things you want to do.

36:53.555 --> 36:55.594
- Go to medical school.
- That's not so easy.

36:55.765 --> 36:56.928
- Get married.
- I was married!

36:57.100 --> 36:59.770
- Get pregnant.
- I was pregnant!

37:00.854 --> 37:02.397
What happened?

37:05.026 --> 37:06.568
What happened?

37:13.368 --> 37:15.444
I had an abortion.

37:20.501 --> 37:22.957
Some people aren't meant
to be mothers.

37:26.591 --> 37:28.584
Abby...

37:28.760 --> 37:33.636
...I was a lot younger than you are now
when I had my first manic episode.

37:33.807 --> 37:37.259
I've watched you since you were
a little girl. You're not bipolar.

37:37.437 --> 37:39.180
No. But my kids could be.

37:39.355 --> 37:42.107
But they might not be.
They could be anything.

37:42.275 --> 37:45.276
And you will just love them.
That's all.

37:48.532 --> 37:51.284
You never even told Richard, did you?

37:52.411 --> 37:56.575
No, I think that was
the beginning of the end for us...

37:56.750 --> 37:59.585
...because we just stopped talking
about everything.

38:00.837 --> 38:02.877
I just was too scared.

38:04.374 --> 38:10.310
I couldn't risk it.
I just- I didn't want to...

38:12.475 --> 38:14.468
- Turn into me?
- Yeah.

38:15.020 --> 38:18.804
Or have to end up
taking care of another me?

38:19.817 --> 38:23.649
Oh, honey.
Oh, sweetie, sweetie, sweetie.

38:24.614 --> 38:26.488
That's all there is is risk.

38:27.409 --> 38:31.573
You just have to take a chance
and leap into life.

38:31.747 --> 38:35.911
Otherwise, sweetheart, you're gonna
miss out on all the great things.

38:37.169 --> 38:40.503
Abby, you deserve all the great things.

38:41.508 --> 38:43.417
Do you hear me?

38:47.681 --> 38:49.389
But I like my home.

38:49.558 --> 38:51.847
Someone there
will take good care of you.

38:52.019 --> 38:54.012
This man's gonna drive you, okay?

38:54.188 --> 38:56.228
Jimmy was gonna make me hot dogs.

38:56.399 --> 38:58.024
Take this woman to this address.

38:58.193 --> 39:01.194
Make sure she's met
by an adult before you leave.

39:01.363 --> 39:03.937
- Yeah, all right.
- Will they have hot dogs?

39:04.116 --> 39:07.817
I don't know. But I'm sure they'll have
something good. Here you go.

39:07.995 --> 39:09.905
I had better go to my home.

39:10.081 --> 39:12.038
I'm sorry. You can't.

39:12.208 --> 39:15.708
But I like my home.
I like my bed and my blanket.

39:16.630 --> 39:18.872
Bonnie, you can't live alone.

39:20.175 --> 39:22.417
But I need my blanket.

39:22.595 --> 39:26.213
- Jimmy always gives me my blanket.
- Someone there will give you one.

39:26.391 --> 39:29.178
And he gives me hot dogs
when I want.

39:30.520 --> 39:34.732
- I like my home. I don't want a new one.
- Bonnie...

39:37.778 --> 39:41.942
Zip your jacket, sweetie.
It's chilly.

40:02.097 --> 40:05.015
Hey, batter, batter.
No batter. No batter.

40:05.559 --> 40:07.053
Strike one!

40:07.228 --> 40:08.971
- That's good, right?
- That's good.

40:09.146 --> 40:11.768
- Put it right here, doc.
- You got it, big guy.

40:14.110 --> 40:16.317
- That's strike two.
- That's all right.

40:19.741 --> 40:21.284
Luka, look alive, man.

40:21.452 --> 40:23.908
Hey, batter, batter.
No batter. No batter.

40:30.587 --> 40:33.208
- You change your mind?
- I even brought my own glove.

40:33.382 --> 40:35.090
- Hey, Abby. You playing?
- Yeah.

40:35.259 --> 40:37.750
Pick your weapon
because you're up after Carter.

40:37.928 --> 40:40.217
All right. Keep your head
in the game.

40:40.723 --> 40:41.802
You brought your mom?

40:41.974 --> 40:44.430
- Go get them, John.
- Thank you, Maggie.

40:45.270 --> 40:47.263
All right, Carter. Get in there, man.

40:47.439 --> 40:51.022
- Luka, I didn't know you played softball.
- I don't. I'm last in the batting order.

40:51.193 --> 40:54.443
You should put Abby up. She was
an all-star on her Little League team.

40:54.613 --> 40:57.021
- How about you?
- I'm just gonna watch.

40:57.784 --> 40:59.243
All-star?

40:59.410 --> 41:01.035
I like you in that hat.

41:01.204 --> 41:04.122
- I almost look American, huh?
- Almost.

41:10.339 --> 41:12.297
Some vocabulary for a 7-year-old.

41:12.467 --> 41:16.299
Bone survey turned up bilateral
healed spiral fractures of the radius.

41:16.471 --> 41:19.258
- So you were right.
- Pin a rose on me.

41:20.601 --> 41:21.881
Kim?

41:22.311 --> 41:24.268
Hi, Kerry.

41:24.814 --> 41:27.387
- This is for you.
- What is it?

41:27.567 --> 41:32.395
It's how I feel about things, about you.
And I never really told you.

41:32.572 --> 41:36.107
And maybe it doesn't matter now.
But I wanted you to know.

41:38.287 --> 41:39.781
Okay.

41:45.670 --> 41:47.959
You broke both your arms, Ben.

41:48.548 --> 41:50.292
No, they're fine.

41:50.467 --> 41:54.631
These are your x-rays.
These lines are fractures.

41:55.765 --> 41:58.801
That was a long time ago.
I tripped at school.

41:58.976 --> 42:02.677
No. You don't get these
kinds of breaks from falling.

42:03.857 --> 42:06.526
After I tripped, I fell down the stairs.

42:06.693 --> 42:10.063
No, Ben. You know
what I think happened?

42:10.239 --> 42:14.023
I think somebody grabbed your arm
with two hands...

42:14.202 --> 42:18.330
...and then twisted it
like you do with a wet towel.

42:20.542 --> 42:21.953
I'm bad a lot.

42:22.836 --> 42:24.544
You are?

42:27.216 --> 42:31.428
I make too much noise playing.
I leave messes.

42:31.596 --> 42:34.087
And Dad punishes you?

42:38.103 --> 42:40.345
Well, how does he punish you?

42:42.608 --> 42:47.401
Sometimes like you said.
He calls them Indian burns.

42:47.572 --> 42:48.853
Yeah?

42:49.741 --> 42:52.778
It's my fault. He wouldn't do it
if I wasn't bad.

42:52.953 --> 42:55.029
No, Ben.

42:55.205 --> 42:57.282
Nobody should break your arm...

42:57.458 --> 43:00.910
...no matter how bad you are.
You understand?

43:01.087 --> 43:04.539
I don't care. I just want to go home.

43:05.801 --> 43:07.959
You can't go home right now, Ben.

43:08.929 --> 43:10.174
I'm sorry.

43:11.557 --> 43:13.846
Come on, Malik!
Show them where you live!

43:16.270 --> 43:20.185
Run, Abby! Run, Abby!

43:20.358 --> 43:22.932
Abby, go! Abby!

43:23.737 --> 43:26.311
- Way to go!
- Brought your cheering section, I see.

43:26.490 --> 43:28.981
That's my girl! That's great!

43:29.160 --> 43:31.069
Go get them.

43:31.579 --> 43:36.325
All right, Luka. Just meet the ball
like we talked about, all right?

43:36.585 --> 43:38.791
- Hey.
- Strike one!

43:38.962 --> 43:42.248
You were so great. You were great.
Did you hear me cheering?

43:42.424 --> 43:46.292
Yes. I think everybody
heard you cheering.

43:47.472 --> 43:50.556
- Strike two.
- Luka, don't crowd the plate!

43:50.725 --> 43:54.225
- What?
- The plate! Get back!

43:55.647 --> 43:58.898
- He's cute but he's no Mickey Mantle.
- No.

43:59.068 --> 44:00.479
Ball one.

44:01.696 --> 44:03.653
- Are you cold?
- No, no. I love it.

44:03.823 --> 44:06.112
Thank you for bringing me here.

44:06.409 --> 44:08.948
- You looked like you were having fun.
- I was.

44:09.329 --> 44:12.580
That's good. That's really good.

44:15.211 --> 44:16.491
Foul ball.

44:16.671 --> 44:18.829
That's a foul ball. That's a foul ball!

44:19.007 --> 44:22.341
- Where are you going?
- I don't think he knows that.

44:23.053 --> 44:25.509
Run, Luka! Run!

44:26.515 --> 44:27.844
Luka!
