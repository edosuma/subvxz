00:17.785 --> 00:19.284
Take a deep breath.

00:25.593 --> 00:28.093
Is that getting worse?

00:28.095 --> 00:30.095
I don't know about worse.

00:30.097 --> 00:32.531
It's certainly not
getting any better.

00:34.135 --> 00:36.035
You always wear your mask?

00:37.204 --> 00:39.738
You're around 'em a lot,
the more you breathe that in

00:39.740 --> 00:41.340
the worse it's gonna get.

00:45.312 --> 00:48.680
You can't keep breathing
the same air as them

00:48.682 --> 00:50.816
and not expect to be affected.

00:50.818 --> 00:52.184
Take a puff.

00:55.790 --> 00:59.491
It's been about three and a
half years since the Taking.

00:59.493 --> 01:03.128
I don't really remember
much before then.

01:05.599 --> 01:08.267
They say the amnesia
wears off eventually,

01:08.269 --> 01:11.170
but I don't feel it yet.

01:12.239 --> 01:16.475
Just some weird dreams
here and there.

01:16.477 --> 01:17.476
How's the head?

01:18.679 --> 01:19.678
Still nothing.

01:22.516 --> 01:24.349
I had this dream.

01:25.586 --> 01:31.223
You had giant eagle wings,
you were carrying me

01:32.293 --> 01:34.426
upside down by your talons.

01:35.496 --> 01:38.697
Which is a super weird
thing to say to your doctor.

01:38.699 --> 01:42.267
It's not even the weirdest
thing I've heard today.

01:42.269 --> 01:44.303
I know very few things for sure.

01:45.706 --> 01:50.509
I know my parents died in the
car crash that took my memory.

01:53.714 --> 01:57.416
I know our world is just
finally beginning to know peace.

01:58.452 --> 02:01.587
Our sovereign leader came to
us when we needed him most.

02:03.757 --> 02:07.126
I know my name is A51-317.

02:08.628 --> 02:10.229
It's in our best interest to try

02:10.231 --> 02:12.364
not to remember the old world.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.801
The hate is contagious.

02:15.803 --> 02:19.505
Well, keep your mask on
while you're working.

02:20.708 --> 02:22.474
We need you guys in the field.

02:26.614 --> 02:28.213
If he's for us?

02:30.317 --> 02:31.617
Who can be against us.

02:33.821 --> 02:37.289
I know we must protect
our new world at any cost.

02:38.325 --> 02:41.527
I know the Taking purged
much of the old world filth.

02:43.230 --> 02:45.430
But others rise up
in their place.

02:46.500 --> 02:50.335
Many are left that would
destroy our peace if they could.

02:50.337 --> 02:52.671
The forbidden book teaches
them to hate.

02:53.741 --> 02:55.440
That's why we do what we do.

02:56.377 --> 02:58.744
Someone has to keep the evil out.

02:58.746 --> 03:01.780
I know for sure I'm no different
than any other citizen.

03:01.782 --> 03:04.683
I trust our sovereign
leader when he says

03:04.685 --> 03:09.321
that if he is for us,
who can be against us?

03:30.978 --> 03:33.312
Do we make ourselves clear?

03:35.749 --> 03:36.748
That's right.

03:38.219 --> 03:39.651
You didn't even know.

03:39.653 --> 03:41.787
I fooled all of you.

03:41.789 --> 03:43.822
Red, shut up.

03:43.824 --> 03:45.224
Is that it?

03:45.859 --> 03:47.626
Anybody else with a weapon?

03:51.999 --> 03:54.233
I asked a question.

04:11.018 --> 04:13.252
I take it he's with you.

04:14.455 --> 04:17.422
Please don't. Please.

04:17.423 --> 04:18.957
He's her brother.
He's her brother.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.625
Red.

04:20.628 --> 04:21.692
Shut up.

04:23.998 --> 04:24.963
A brother?

04:24.965 --> 04:28.800
It's always nice to see
families sticking together.

04:29.637 --> 04:30.969
Uh-oh.

04:30.971 --> 04:32.771
What do we have here?

04:35.042 --> 04:37.542
Looks like somebody's
been naughty.

04:39.813 --> 04:41.680
It's okay, buddy.

04:41.682 --> 04:43.482
It's gonna be okay.

04:46.854 --> 04:48.287
Don't do that.

04:48.289 --> 04:49.554
Don't give him hope.

04:52.893 --> 04:54.660
You people don't deserve hope.

05:07.808 --> 05:08.807
Beg.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.076
Please.

05:11.078 --> 05:12.911
He's all I have left.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.446
Shh.

05:15.416 --> 05:17.616
He's not all you have left.

05:38.605 --> 05:42.507
You... have... nothing.

05:47.948 --> 05:49.715
Burn the books.

05:49.717 --> 05:52.351
I don't care what you do
with the women.

05:52.953 --> 05:54.586
But make the men watch.

05:55.389 --> 05:57.356
I demand execution.

05:59.360 --> 06:00.759
What did you just say?

06:01.695 --> 06:02.928
C55.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.965
I have nothing illegal
in my possession.

06:06.967 --> 06:09.768
The only thing I'm
guilty of, is association.

06:10.704 --> 06:15.674
I am entitled to
execution by him.

06:17.444 --> 06:18.777
We bring her.

06:20.114 --> 06:22.647
You think you're real
smart, don't ya?

06:23.584 --> 06:25.751
You know we're gonna
have to search you, right?

06:25.753 --> 06:28.720
To verify that you don't
have any contraband on you?

06:29.890 --> 06:32.391
And we're real thorough.

06:43.137 --> 06:44.669
Paul.

06:46.407 --> 06:48.106
You didn't have to
get me anything.

06:48.108 --> 06:49.808
You've hardly been gone.

06:55.416 --> 06:57.883
Kill them all before they talk.

06:57.885 --> 06:59.985
You will not regret this.

07:08.529 --> 07:10.495
What was that back there?

07:10.497 --> 07:12.631
She demanded execution.

07:12.633 --> 07:14.666
We do what he sees best.

07:16.036 --> 07:17.702
Is that understood?

07:26.980 --> 07:27.979
Hey.

07:28.682 --> 07:30.549
You know I love you, right?

07:31.118 --> 07:32.651
No matter what.

07:41.528 --> 07:43.595
<i>You didn't have to</i>
<i>get me anything.</i>

07:43.597 --> 07:44.663
<i>You know I love you?</i>

07:44.665 --> 07:45.497
<i>Hardly been gone.</i>

07:45.499 --> 07:46.698
<i>No matter what.</i>

07:50.070 --> 07:52.070
<i>No matter what.</i>

07:52.072 --> 07:53.538
I love you, Paulie.

07:53.540 --> 07:55.140
You're gonna be a messenger.

07:55.142 --> 07:57.509
You're gonna bring
people good news.

08:44.992 --> 08:45.991
Paul.

10:05.906 --> 10:08.340
Sacred father,
may our sovereign leader

10:08.342 --> 10:10.075
live forever.

10:10.077 --> 10:11.710
That he shall, my child.

10:19.052 --> 10:20.785
I can't believe it's you.

10:21.955 --> 10:24.756
How am I so privileged to
have you in my presence?

10:25.292 --> 10:28.159
Be encouraged, he is with you.

10:30.230 --> 10:31.196
Mighty warrior.

10:33.667 --> 10:35.767
I come with glad tidings.

10:42.643 --> 10:47.178
- I'm so sorry, sacred father.
- I see region housing hasn't lost any of its charm.

10:50.684 --> 10:52.951
Bit of a cooking mishap?

10:52.953 --> 10:56.721
Yeah, I was attempting
a new recipe.

10:58.358 --> 11:03.028
Be not ashamed, child.
We've all burned things we desired to try.

11:07.701 --> 11:12.270
You are A51-317, yes?

11:12.272 --> 11:14.039
Yes, your grace.

11:15.308 --> 11:16.908
And you live alone?

11:16.910 --> 11:19.811
Yes, sacred father,
most of our teams do,

11:19.813 --> 11:22.113
to help maintain focus
on our task.

11:23.750 --> 11:26.217
Which I'm sure you
already knew that.

11:27.154 --> 11:28.119
I'm sorry.

11:29.723 --> 11:31.990
Very wise, my son.

11:31.992 --> 11:34.225
Lust of this world
only distract us

11:34.227 --> 11:36.995
from our unadulterated
worship of him.

11:38.432 --> 11:40.699
Must take the kingdom first.

11:41.768 --> 11:44.969
All the rest will be
given to you as well.

11:47.741 --> 11:50.208
It's what we aim for,
your grace.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.310
I hope you don't think
we've fallen short.

11:54.247 --> 11:55.280
Of course not.

11:55.282 --> 11:58.917
We know you're a good
and faithful servant.

11:59.786 --> 12:02.954
As I said, we come
with glad tidings.

12:04.825 --> 12:06.157
Your time has come.

12:07.294 --> 12:09.127
He has requested your presence.

12:11.364 --> 12:12.731
Who?

12:13.800 --> 12:16.101
The king of kings
and Lord of Lords.

12:17.471 --> 12:19.871
The sovereign leader is here.

12:36.823 --> 12:39.224
A51-317, I presume.

12:46.366 --> 12:47.365
Come.

12:48.468 --> 12:49.801
Follow me.

12:58.345 --> 12:59.344
Do you thirst?

13:01.381 --> 13:02.514
I'm fine, your sovereignty.

13:02.516 --> 13:04.516
Thank you.

13:04.518 --> 13:06.317
Drink, son, you look parched.

13:19.299 --> 13:22.200
I have many great plans
for our new world.

13:23.136 --> 13:27.806
Plans that prosper us, to
give us a hope and a future.

13:28.909 --> 13:31.075
And the way I desire
for my plans to unfold

13:31.077 --> 13:33.845
is with the involvement
of my people.

13:34.414 --> 13:38.082
Only the people called
by my name will prosper.

13:38.084 --> 13:42.921
And my people must soon
be sealed in my name.

13:44.591 --> 13:46.858
You understand what I mean, A51?

13:49.162 --> 13:53.164
No, your sovereignty, I don't.

13:55.602 --> 13:56.968
You will.

13:58.138 --> 13:59.103
Soon.

14:04.611 --> 14:06.978
As you know, I'm a
very hands on man.

14:07.848 --> 14:10.582
I prefer to do
all the executions myself,

14:10.584 --> 14:14.219
but sadly it's not
a possibility.

14:15.055 --> 14:17.589
Which is why I need
the dedicated.

14:17.591 --> 14:19.357
It's why I need men like you.

14:20.093 --> 14:22.427
On this current execution
tour, I've been traveling

14:22.429 --> 14:25.330
throughout all of the regions
asking a few of my elect

14:25.332 --> 14:29.000
to step up into their rightful
roles in the coming days.

14:30.036 --> 14:31.970
We'll need to work together
more than ever

14:31.972 --> 14:34.205
in the next hours of our world.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.374
Anything, your sovereignty.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.109
Absolutely anything.

14:39.346 --> 14:40.278
Good.

14:40.280 --> 14:42.647
Perhaps I'm stepping
out on a limb here,

14:42.649 --> 14:45.383
but I summoned you
here to offer you

14:45.385 --> 14:47.418
a new position in my
administration.

14:48.221 --> 14:51.222
I'd like for you to take over
my world preservation

14:51.224 --> 14:53.324
operations in all the region.

14:54.060 --> 14:57.228
Everyone who is opposed to peace

14:57.230 --> 14:59.430
in the five surrounding cities

14:59.432 --> 15:03.902
will be dealt with by your
team, chosen and led by you,

15:03.904 --> 15:06.938
and as you succeed,
the opportunity

15:06.940 --> 15:09.440
for advancement is limitless.

15:10.610 --> 15:15.046
Your sovereignty,
I-- I am beyond honored.

15:16.216 --> 15:17.215
I'm no one.

15:17.217 --> 15:21.152
I don't deserve a place
in your leadership.

15:22.656 --> 15:25.356
I see so much potential
in you, A51.

15:26.693 --> 15:28.359
Do not doubt yourself.

15:30.130 --> 15:33.498
My power is made perfect
in your weakness.

15:34.534 --> 15:37.969
A power that has yet to
be displayed to the world.

15:39.339 --> 15:40.939
Do you believe that?

15:42.709 --> 15:44.509
Do you believe in my power?

15:54.487 --> 15:57.722
Don't feel like you have
to answer right away.

15:57.724 --> 15:59.324
We'll be in touch.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.067
Take heart, my son.

16:14.975 --> 16:16.274
I am for you.

17:00.387 --> 17:02.687
I wouldn't accept his
offer if I were you.

17:07.426 --> 17:09.060
Dr. A6?

17:09.061 --> 17:10.627
Put the gun down, Paul.

17:10.630 --> 17:12.163
What are you doing here?

17:12.766 --> 17:15.165
I'm glad to see my makeup
and fake cough

17:15.167 --> 17:17.201
has fooled you all these years.

17:18.338 --> 17:21.138
I guess you can call
me Harold now.

17:21.141 --> 17:22.440
You're defiant?

17:23.376 --> 17:24.442
Why?

17:25.811 --> 17:28.311
That question has
so many answers.

17:31.184 --> 17:33.251
But it boils down to
a true understanding

17:33.253 --> 17:35.520
of a few certain words.

17:36.389 --> 17:39.057
Peace, hate...

17:41.061 --> 17:42.393
love.

17:44.397 --> 17:47.398
To believe in a word
is not the same

17:47.400 --> 17:49.667
as knowing and believing
in its meaning.

17:50.603 --> 17:51.769
Don't move.

17:51.771 --> 17:54.205
I swear to God I'll kill you.

17:54.207 --> 17:55.606
I don't know what you're doing,

17:55.608 --> 17:57.675
but I am required to
kill you if you don't

17:57.677 --> 17:59.544
help me understand right now.

18:01.181 --> 18:04.082
The girl, Esther, that
you took this morning,

18:04.084 --> 18:07.218
is part of a special
group of defiants I lead.

18:09.422 --> 18:13.124
Her brother is the young
boy you watched die.

18:15.328 --> 18:17.462
I need you to help us
get her back.

18:18.665 --> 18:22.567
Your memories, they're
getting worse, aren't they?

18:22.569 --> 18:23.701
Shut up.

18:23.703 --> 18:25.703
Just shut up.

18:25.705 --> 18:28.139
So you were just spying
on me the whole time?

18:28.141 --> 18:29.740
Oh, it's much more than that.

18:30.577 --> 18:33.344
- We think it's time, Paul.
- Stop calling me that.

18:33.346 --> 18:37.548
Tell me, did you remember
the entire book all at once?

18:37.550 --> 18:40.118
Or is it coming back
to you in pieces?

18:44.891 --> 18:47.425
Not our first rodeo, kid.

18:47.427 --> 18:49.260
It's not our intention
to hurt you,

18:49.262 --> 18:51.162
despite what you might believe.

19:08.648 --> 19:10.181
You ready to talk?

19:11.885 --> 19:14.152
Got nothing to say to you.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.254
Traitor.

19:18.391 --> 19:21.926
Except I hope you thought
through every angle of this,

19:21.928 --> 19:23.561
'cause they're going
to come for me.

19:24.330 --> 19:26.197
They don't want you, Paul.

19:26.199 --> 19:28.766
You are in so over your head.

19:28.768 --> 19:33.938
The sovereign leader offered
me a promotion, personally,

19:33.940 --> 19:36.641
to kill all of you.

19:36.643 --> 19:37.608
I know.

19:38.778 --> 19:40.478
It's not for why you think.

19:41.915 --> 19:43.748
They found out things about you.

19:45.285 --> 19:47.285
They know who you really are.

19:48.421 --> 19:51.489
They know that your memory's
beginning to return.

19:53.393 --> 19:55.459
We want you to join us, Paul.

19:57.664 --> 20:00.398
That's what this is
about?

20:00.400 --> 20:03.668
Oh, oh, this is my
welcome party then, huh?

20:03.670 --> 20:06.304
Tell me, what would possess
you to believe

20:06.306 --> 20:08.206
that I would join you?

20:09.676 --> 20:10.875
You recognize her?

20:10.877 --> 20:15.346
I'm gonna kill you! Let me out,
you have no idea what you're doing.

20:15.348 --> 20:19.617
You're the one with the forbidden book and
the illegal old world photo in your house.

20:22.755 --> 20:24.822
Oh, I'm gonna kill you.

20:24.824 --> 20:27.892
I'm gonna kill you, and
I'm gonna make it slow.

20:27.894 --> 20:31.429
I'm gonna find your wife and kids,
I'm gonna make you watch.

20:31.431 --> 20:33.364
Did you ever have a dog?

20:35.935 --> 20:37.535
Did you ever have a dog?

20:37.537 --> 20:42.406
Do you know where you lived before they moved you to region housing?

20:44.711 --> 20:47.845
- What was your favorite color?
- Let me out.

20:47.847 --> 20:52.550
You know about you what
they tell you about you.

20:52.552 --> 20:54.952
So far that's been your
greatest asset.

20:54.954 --> 20:57.321
Your sovereign leader wanted you

20:57.323 --> 20:59.290
because you're a clean slate.

20:59.292 --> 21:02.827
You're the perfect follower because you have no idea who you are.

21:03.730 --> 21:06.397
But all that changed when
you began to remember.

21:06.399 --> 21:08.266
They're trying to contact him.

21:08.268 --> 21:09.634
We need to get him back.

21:09.636 --> 21:11.152
Oh, no.

21:11.153 --> 21:12.669
We were just getting
to the good part.

21:12.672 --> 21:16.674
Very soon, your sovereign
leader's gonna be murdered,

21:16.676 --> 21:19.277
through a fatal wound
to his head.

21:19.979 --> 21:21.545
Probably a gunshot.

21:22.482 --> 21:24.849
We believe he may even
arrange it himself.

21:25.618 --> 21:30.288
Three and a half days later,
he's gonna rise from the dead

21:30.290 --> 21:31.889
and claim to be God.

21:34.494 --> 21:35.860
We'll see you soon, Paul.

22:24.644 --> 22:28.045
This is A51-317, I lead
Peace Team Gallica 3

22:28.047 --> 22:29.714
in Region 5.

22:29.716 --> 22:31.982
Password you're about to
ask for is rainbow scepter.

22:31.984 --> 22:34.685
I have reason to believe
that there will be an attempt

22:34.687 --> 22:37.621
on the sovereign leader's life
in the very near future.

22:38.791 --> 22:39.757
What...

22:40.793 --> 22:41.992
Do you hear me?

22:41.994 --> 22:43.594
I believe the sovereign leader

22:43.596 --> 22:46.497
of the new world
is gonna be assassinated.

22:47.800 --> 22:48.966
Hello?

22:54.707 --> 22:56.640
<i>This will just be our secret.</i>

22:56.642 --> 22:58.776
<i>I promise not to tell</i>
<i>Dad if you don't.</i>

22:58.778 --> 23:01.612
And when you come and
dig this up someday,

23:01.614 --> 23:03.748
always remember,
it's for you first

23:03.750 --> 23:05.616
and then the rest of the world.

23:05.618 --> 23:07.551
It has to be in that order.

23:07.553 --> 23:09.820
You first and then the
rest of the world.

23:22.168 --> 23:24.668
You have got to be kidding me right now.

23:24.670 --> 23:27.805
Ma'am, I don't think you understand the
gravity of what you're doing right now.

23:27.807 --> 23:32.910
I work for the sovereign leader and have
reason to believe his life is in danger.

23:32.912 --> 23:34.712
Let me use your phone.

23:42.155 --> 23:44.622
I know who you are.

23:45.625 --> 23:50.161
A51-317.

23:50.163 --> 23:52.897
You're not using the phone.

23:52.899 --> 23:54.932
You're not going anywhere.

23:55.868 --> 24:01.472
To be honest,
I'm afraid if I move,

24:02.074 --> 24:05.509
I just might kill you myself.

24:06.045 --> 24:07.011
What?

24:09.048 --> 24:12.650
We're gonna wait right here
for the government men

24:12.652 --> 24:16.220
to show up and give me my reward

24:16.222 --> 24:20.658
and give you what you deserve.

24:20.660 --> 24:23.794
Ma'am, I don't know
who you think I am,

24:23.796 --> 24:25.963
but you are clearly confused.

24:26.833 --> 24:29.567
<i>People of the new world</i>

24:30.536 --> 24:31.769
<i>I'm back.</i>

24:31.771 --> 24:34.205
Ma'am?

24:34.941 --> 24:36.674
<i>- I hear a lot has happened the last three days.</i>
- Ma'am.

24:36.676 --> 24:40.144
- Quiet.
- <i>Sorry I've missed out.</i>

24:40.146 --> 24:43.080
<i>Obviously I don't mean to make</i>
<i>light of what has happened.</i>

24:43.082 --> 24:44.648
<i>I know it's been a very trying</i>

24:44.650 --> 24:47.551
<i>and burdensome time</i>
<i>for many of you.</i>

24:47.553 --> 24:50.888
<i>I'd like to tell you that one</i>
<i>of our own has betrayed us.</i>

24:52.859 --> 24:56.026
<i>But in reality we've been</i>
<i>infiltrated by impostors.</i>

24:57.763 --> 25:00.097
<i>As many of you know, three</i>
<i>days ago I was shot in the head</i>

25:00.099 --> 25:03.000
<i>and confirmed dead by</i>
<i>several physicians</i>

25:03.002 --> 25:07.738
<i>by the defiant terrorist</i>
<i>known as A51-317,</i>

25:07.740 --> 25:11.776
<i>assisted in the completion</i>
<i>of his treasonous act</i>

25:11.777 --> 25:15.813
<i>- by Dr. A6-RB19, a local peace team physician.</i>
- How'd that work out for you?

25:15.815 --> 25:20.017
<i>These men pretended to be like us
so that they become a part of our system,</i>

25:20.019 --> 25:22.620
<i>all the while plotting</i>
<i>against us.</i>

25:22.622 --> 25:25.823
<i>So many of these hateful groups have remained in our new world</i>

25:25.825 --> 25:27.858
<i>far longer than we should've</i>
<i>allowed them to.</i>

25:27.860 --> 25:30.094
<i>It was only a matter</i>
<i>of time before</i>

25:30.096 --> 25:32.062
<i>they did something drastic.</i>

25:32.064 --> 25:34.265
<i>So for the security</i>
<i>of our new world,</i>

25:34.267 --> 25:37.935
<i>it is in our best interest</i>
<i>that true citizens</i>

25:37.937 --> 25:39.770
<i>of the new world</i>
<i>from here on out</i>

25:39.772 --> 25:42.740
<i>be distinctly identifiable.</i>

25:42.742 --> 25:44.675
<i>No more of these</i>
<i>hateful murderers</i>

25:44.677 --> 25:47.278
<i>getting into our stores</i>
<i>and our hospitals,</i>

25:47.280 --> 25:50.214
<i>our schools, and our homes.</i>

25:50.216 --> 25:55.219
<i>From here on out, those</i>
<i>who choose to live by peace</i>

25:56.022 --> 26:01.058
<i>will receive my seal, on their</i>
<i>right hand or their forehead.</i>

26:01.060 --> 26:04.161
<i>In an effort to expedite the</i>
<i>process and ensure your safety,</i>

26:04.163 --> 26:07.131
<i>you will unfortunately</i>
<i>not be able to buy or sell</i>

26:07.133 --> 26:10.868
<i>without it, but region</i>
<i>peace teams and police</i>

26:10.870 --> 26:13.871
<i>will be available at</i>
<i>every major retailer,</i>

26:13.873 --> 26:16.941
<i>hospital, and world</i>
<i>preservation center,</i>

26:16.943 --> 26:20.644
<i>allowing for quick</i>
<i>and simple access</i>

26:20.646 --> 26:23.247
<i>so that those of you</i>
<i>who choose peace</i>

26:23.249 --> 26:26.984
<i>can get on with your everyday</i>
<i>lives as quickly as possible.</i>

26:29.689 --> 26:31.789
<i>And as some of you</i>
<i>have suspected,</i>

26:33.593 --> 26:36.293
<i>I am the God of all creation,</i>

26:36.295 --> 26:37.995
<i>the long awaited savior...</i>

26:37.997 --> 26:40.831
...will rise from the dead
and claim to be God.

26:40.833 --> 26:44.335
<i>And I have come up to my</i>
<i>people because I saw your pain.</i>

26:45.204 --> 26:49.340
<i>I have come so that you</i>
<i>might have abundant life.</i>

26:49.342 --> 26:54.678
<i>Let me release you from your</i>
<i>pain and your death, my people.</i>

26:55.848 --> 26:58.882
<i>Let the God of all comfort</i>
<i>comfort you.</i>

27:01.687 --> 27:03.787
<i>- For I so loved the world...</i>

27:03.789 --> 27:05.823
Region 5 Police, ma'am. Open up!

27:05.825 --> 27:08.859
<i>- ...whoever believes in me...</i>
- I hope they televise your execution.

27:08.861 --> 27:10.394
<i>...shall not perish...</i>

27:10.396 --> 27:12.162
I want to see you pay
for what you did.

27:12.164 --> 27:14.198
<i>...but have</i>
<i>everlasting life.</i>

27:15.668 --> 27:20.070
<i>I have brought you</i>
<i>everlasting life.</i>

27:20.072 --> 27:22.906
Thank you, ma'am we'll take it from here.

27:25.277 --> 27:26.844
Defiant scum.

27:31.350 --> 27:33.651
Hey, what about my reward?

27:33.653 --> 27:34.918
As soon as you receive your
seal, ma'am,

27:34.920 --> 27:37.054
it'll be deposited
into your account.

27:47.066 --> 27:48.432
I didn't do this.

27:48.434 --> 27:50.167
You're making a big mistake.

27:50.870 --> 27:52.069
It doesn't matter.

27:56.876 --> 27:58.275
You're defiant now.

27:59.412 --> 28:00.811
You?

28:00.813 --> 28:02.413
Why are you doing this to me?

28:02.415 --> 28:04.181
We didn't do anything.

28:04.183 --> 28:06.250
And you're welcome for
busting you out.

28:06.252 --> 28:09.019
You were minutes away from
a televised beheading.

28:09.021 --> 28:12.823
They know it wasn't me.
I'll just tell them it was you.

28:12.825 --> 28:15.759
It wasn't us, we took you
back to your house that night.

28:15.761 --> 28:17.027
Everybody wave.

28:17.730 --> 28:19.029
Just kidding.

28:19.031 --> 28:20.164
Please don't.

28:20.933 --> 28:23.967
Look, you don't have to do this.

28:25.004 --> 28:28.038
- Let me out and I promise not to pursue you.
- Paul.

28:28.040 --> 28:33.043
- I'm not gonna come after you.
- Paul. The whole world thinks you killed him.

28:33.045 --> 28:34.812
The only one who can
prove you didn't

28:34.814 --> 28:37.181
is the guy
you supposedly killed.

28:37.183 --> 28:40.317
If they ever find you,
he will execute you

28:40.319 --> 28:43.854
on live television, knowing
full well you're innocent.

28:43.856 --> 28:45.756
You don't make any sense.

28:45.758 --> 28:47.191
Why would he frame me?

28:47.193 --> 28:49.059
To make defiants look
like terrorists.

28:49.061 --> 28:51.361
To have a reason
to push the seal.

28:51.363 --> 28:53.297
Defiants already look that way.

28:53.299 --> 28:56.066
If that's all he needed, he
could've blamed any one of you,

28:56.068 --> 28:57.935
the whole world would've
believed it.

28:57.937 --> 28:59.803
But if it came from the inside,

28:59.805 --> 29:01.505
he could call it
a security breach.

29:01.507 --> 29:03.741
He could scare them
into thinking

29:03.743 --> 29:06.877
that everyone around them
might be defiant.

29:06.879 --> 29:09.847
It's all about the seal.

29:09.849 --> 29:11.749
You're a scapegoat, kid.

29:12.818 --> 29:14.184
Doesn't make any sense.

29:15.221 --> 29:18.088
Just identifying citizens
is not that important.

29:18.090 --> 29:21.058
Oh, it's much more important
than you realize right now.

29:21.060 --> 29:23.227
Do you all actually believe
this garbage?

29:23.229 --> 29:25.496
Or do you just not like
following rules?

29:25.498 --> 29:27.831
It's not about rules, kid.

29:27.833 --> 29:29.266
It's about history.

29:29.268 --> 29:32.336
It's about being on the
right side when it's written.

29:34.340 --> 29:36.173
What if you chose wrong?

29:38.444 --> 29:40.043
What if we're right?

29:41.881 --> 29:45.215
Either way, you'll just
have to trust us.

29:45.217 --> 29:47.417
You're in no position
to make demands.

29:47.419 --> 29:50.854
Not to mention you've been
off the grid for three days.

29:50.856 --> 29:53.257
Your Region 5 rifle
was used to kill him,

29:53.259 --> 29:56.093
and they found that book
in your house

29:56.095 --> 29:58.996
with the picture of your
defiant mother inside.

29:58.998 --> 30:00.297
Where?

30:00.299 --> 30:01.431
Where what?

30:01.433 --> 30:03.233
The book, where is it?

30:03.235 --> 30:06.270
Unless they burned it already
it's still at your house,

30:06.272 --> 30:07.938
where we left you and it.

30:07.940 --> 30:09.907
It's still there,
but there's a few guys

30:09.909 --> 30:11.875
camped out at the house.

30:11.877 --> 30:14.812
We may or may not have
bugged your house.

30:15.381 --> 30:17.347
Just being honest.

30:17.349 --> 30:19.183
We have to go back.

30:19.185 --> 30:22.052
Did you miss the part
about not making demands?

30:22.054 --> 30:25.956
Look, you hate me
and that's fine.

30:26.492 --> 30:28.158
But I have to have that book.

30:28.160 --> 30:31.295
We're not going back
there, that's a death wish.

30:31.297 --> 30:32.830
Please.

30:33.332 --> 30:34.965
The picture.

30:34.967 --> 30:36.200
I'll do anything.

30:37.169 --> 30:38.202
Please.

30:39.438 --> 30:40.437
Will you read it?

30:43.075 --> 30:46.343
If we get the picture,
will you read the book?

30:51.450 --> 30:52.416
Yeah.

31:05.564 --> 31:07.064
I don't hate you, kid.

31:07.066 --> 31:09.399
But you better have a good plan.

31:20.613 --> 31:22.613
Can you guys hear me?

31:22.615 --> 31:24.047
Yeah, we got you.

31:24.049 --> 31:25.349
It's just up here.

31:25.351 --> 31:27.217
Ok, I didn't bring
my full bag of tricks,

31:27.219 --> 31:29.019
because this kind of
got sprung on me,

31:29.021 --> 31:30.988
so I hope you're fine
with winging it.

31:30.990 --> 31:32.956
What are you doing?

31:32.958 --> 31:35.425
All region housing has
an electronics override

31:35.427 --> 31:38.195
outside the house, just in case.

31:39.231 --> 31:40.264
In case of what?

31:43.969 --> 31:45.969
In case we want someone
in the dark.

31:45.971 --> 31:48.672
See? If somebody would've told me ahead of time,
that this was the plan,

31:48.674 --> 31:51.275
I have a perfectly good
EMP back home.

31:51.277 --> 31:54.044
<i>- A lot less digging.</i>
- Caden, how do you use this thing?

31:54.046 --> 31:59.349
<i>Very carefully.</i>
Don't point it at anyone you don't want in serious pain.

31:59.351 --> 32:02.119
As soon as it's turned on,
their ears are toast,

32:02.121 --> 32:05.289
as well as their balance.
<i>Hopefully.</i>

32:05.291 --> 32:08.926
Okay, there's one in the
house and two parked outside.

32:29.481 --> 32:31.448
Here we go.

32:34.186 --> 32:36.520
That's far enough
right there, sir.

32:36.522 --> 32:38.121
Oh, absolutely.

32:38.123 --> 32:40.190
You can never be too
careful around here.

33:00.980 --> 33:02.112
Reggie.

33:02.648 --> 33:04.247
Don't, buddy.

33:04.249 --> 33:07.050
Come on, it's not worth it.

33:19.598 --> 33:20.564
Paul.

33:23.502 --> 33:25.502
I'm okay, I just tripped.

33:44.223 --> 33:46.356
Pretty impressive, right?

33:47.159 --> 33:49.793
It almost completely
disguises my thermal image

33:49.795 --> 33:51.561
from your stupid little drone.

33:52.531 --> 33:54.765
C55, I didn't do it.

33:54.767 --> 33:58.201
You know at first,
I'll be honest,

33:58.203 --> 34:00.337
it was really hard
for me to believe.

34:02.141 --> 34:03.640
Three years.

34:05.244 --> 34:08.277
Three years we raided together,

34:08.280 --> 34:11.047
and never once did I
question your loyalty.

34:12.717 --> 34:14.551
And then it hit me
the other day.

34:16.455 --> 34:21.525
Never do I remember
you ever pulling the trigger.

34:22.594 --> 34:24.527
Not once.

34:24.530 --> 34:28.532
You always found a way
to have one of us do it.

34:28.534 --> 34:29.498
C55...

34:29.501 --> 34:30.667
Shut up.

34:30.668 --> 34:33.469
I stood by you for three years,

34:33.472 --> 34:36.440
and the whole time you were
just plotting your betrayal.

34:36.442 --> 34:39.743
You were so quick to help them
when they demanded execution.

34:39.745 --> 34:41.143
You were trying to save them.

34:41.146 --> 34:42.478
Think about this.

34:43.315 --> 34:46.550
I didn't save any of 'em,
they were all executed.

34:46.552 --> 34:47.751
I don't know that.

34:47.753 --> 34:49.152
I didn't see that happen.

34:49.154 --> 34:51.288
I'll take the seal right now.

34:51.290 --> 34:53.723
Does that sound like
defiant to you?

34:53.725 --> 34:55.525
They think that's the end.

34:55.527 --> 34:58.462
I know he'll believe me
if I can just talk to him.

34:58.464 --> 35:00.497
He doesn't want to talk to you.

35:01.233 --> 35:03.433
Best case scenario,
you can say sorry

35:03.435 --> 35:06.303
when his machete touches
the back of your neck.

35:06.305 --> 35:09.506
C55, I'll do anything.

35:12.811 --> 35:14.211
How many?

35:17.749 --> 35:19.116
Two.

35:20.719 --> 35:22.119
Are they armed?

35:25.491 --> 35:26.656
Not lethally.

35:28.527 --> 35:29.526
Kill them.

35:29.528 --> 35:36.266
Kill them, and you get to spend
one more day in our world.

35:50.883 --> 35:53.150
Don't touch it, Reggie.

35:54.620 --> 35:56.186
Whoa, kid.

35:56.188 --> 35:57.554
What are you doing?

35:57.556 --> 35:59.356
Whatever I have to do
to clear my name.

35:59.358 --> 36:01.491
You know that won't work.

36:01.493 --> 36:03.360
You're dead as soon
as they take you in.

36:03.362 --> 36:05.428
What's it gonna be, A51?

36:05.430 --> 36:06.696
Paul.

36:06.698 --> 36:08.265
Don't do this.

36:12.204 --> 36:14.204
Hey, what did your dad say?

36:14.206 --> 36:15.272
Don't do that.

36:15.274 --> 36:16.740
We don't shoot people,

36:16.742 --> 36:18.508
even if we're pretending.

36:18.510 --> 36:20.177
A51?

36:22.214 --> 36:24.581
Paul, don't do this.

36:24.583 --> 36:27.250
Make up your mind quickly,
or else I'll kill

36:27.252 --> 36:29.920
all of you
with a smile on my face.

36:29.922 --> 36:32.455
Kid, you don't have to do this.

36:33.258 --> 36:34.658
Everyone just shut up.

36:36.929 --> 36:39.563
You don't have to
do this anymore.

37:18.670 --> 37:21.638
Sorry I'm late, I thought
you just needed

37:22.641 --> 37:25.275
a little extra time.

37:39.891 --> 37:42.993
Why'd you do that, Reggie?

37:42.995 --> 37:45.662
It was a stupid thing to do.

37:51.003 --> 37:53.737
We have to go,
they're almost here.

40:40.172 --> 40:44.040
<i>I saw the heaven open,</i>
<i>and behold, a white horse,</i>

40:44.042 --> 40:47.110
<i>and he who sat on it is</i>
<i>called faithful and true.</i>

40:47.846 --> 40:50.447
<i>In righteousness he judges</i>
<i>and makes war.</i>

40:51.049 --> 40:54.584
<i>His eyes are a flame of</i>
<i>fire, and on his head</i>

40:54.586 --> 40:56.085
<i>are many crowns.</i>

40:56.087 --> 40:58.521
<i>He has names written,</i>
<i>and the name written</i>

40:58.523 --> 41:00.523
<i>which no one knows</i>
<i>but he himself.</i>

41:01.092 --> 41:04.794
<i>He is clothed in a garment</i>
<i>sprinkled with blood.</i>

41:04.796 --> 41:07.597
<i>His name is called</i>
<i>The Word of God,</i>

41:07.599 --> 41:11.534
<i>the armies which are in heaven</i>
<i>follow him on a white horse,</i>

41:11.536 --> 41:14.737
<i>clothed in white,</i>
<i>pure, fine linen.</i>

41:15.507 --> 41:18.675
<i>Out of his mouth proceeds</i>
<i>a sharp double-edged sword,</i>

41:18.677 --> 41:21.110
<i>that with it he should</i>
<i>strike the nations.</i>

41:21.112 --> 41:23.880
<i>He will rule them</i>
<i>with an iron rod.</i>

41:24.549 --> 41:26.649
<i>He treads the wine press</i>
<i>of the fierceness</i>

41:26.651 --> 41:29.619
<i>of the wrath of God,</i>
<i>the almighty.</i>

41:29.621 --> 41:33.756
He has on his garment and
on his thigh a name written,

41:33.758 --> 41:37.527
King of Kings and Lord of Lords.

41:56.781 --> 41:59.048
We have plenty of firewood.

42:08.593 --> 42:10.059
Do you like ravioli?

42:15.834 --> 42:17.600
You've got to eat
something, Paul.

42:17.602 --> 42:18.935
It's been a long day.

42:20.138 --> 42:21.671
You know I killed him, right?

42:21.673 --> 42:23.306
Did you gather that
from all the holes

42:23.308 --> 42:24.707
in the story they fed you?

42:25.277 --> 42:27.744
Yes, I understand that.

42:30.715 --> 42:33.550
Harold has a hard time
telling a complete story

42:33.552 --> 42:34.951
at times like these.

42:34.953 --> 42:37.186
He tends to try to
protect the heart

42:37.188 --> 42:39.689
rather than tell the full truth.

42:41.760 --> 42:43.092
Do you like pasta?

42:44.629 --> 42:46.896
I've been trained to
recognize poison.

42:48.300 --> 42:49.699
Just eat.

43:01.780 --> 43:03.646
So what's with the tree?

43:03.648 --> 43:04.914
It's dying.

43:05.750 --> 43:07.817
Carpenter ants in the roots.

43:08.587 --> 43:09.819
How can you tell?

43:11.890 --> 43:14.724
They leave sawdust behind.

43:16.861 --> 43:17.860
Okay.

43:18.797 --> 43:20.630
I'll leave you to your tree.

43:23.935 --> 43:24.901
It's...

43:29.774 --> 43:32.041
How long were you and
Reggie married for?

43:34.346 --> 43:37.780
We were actually at our wedding reception during the Taking.

43:41.353 --> 43:43.052
Do you have children?

43:45.156 --> 43:49.125
I had a son, and Reggie
had two daughters.

43:50.862 --> 43:53.997
They were in the raid
with the boy and the girl.

44:09.714 --> 44:15.184
Reggie, for what it's worth,
died honorably.

44:16.821 --> 44:20.356
I was aiming for Harold and
he jumped in front of it,

44:20.358 --> 44:21.958
to try and protect him.

44:25.196 --> 44:26.929
I know my Reggie.

44:28.066 --> 44:30.800
And I don't think he was
trying to protect Harold.

45:39.204 --> 45:40.336
<i>Paul.</i>

45:40.338 --> 45:47.310
Caden. Oh, scared the crap
out of me. What do you want?

45:47.312 --> 45:49.378
Scared the crap out of me,
what do you want?

45:49.380 --> 45:51.380
Caden, go to bed.

45:51.382 --> 45:54.751
That was the plan till you
pumped me full of adrenaline.

45:56.788 --> 45:58.221
<i>Paul</i>.

45:59.224 --> 46:01.824
Caden, this is not funny.

46:01.826 --> 46:02.959
Not even close, bro.

46:02.961 --> 46:05.128
<i>Paul.</i>

46:06.831 --> 46:08.197
<i>Paul.</i>

46:11.236 --> 46:12.769
<i>Paul.</i>

46:21.980 --> 46:24.046
<i>I am for you, Paul.</i>

46:28.787 --> 46:30.086
<i>Paul.</i>

46:31.823 --> 46:33.189
Show yourself!

46:34.092 --> 46:36.225
<i>Not yet.</i>

46:36.227 --> 46:38.795
<i>But I'm not going</i>
<i>to hurt you, Paul.</i>

46:39.864 --> 46:41.397
<i>It's time.</i>

46:41.399 --> 46:43.299
Oh yeah?

46:43.301 --> 46:44.567
What's it time for?

46:44.569 --> 46:46.335
<i>To remember.</i>

46:47.505 --> 46:49.038
<i>Do you want to remember?</i>

46:49.040 --> 46:51.174
What do you want from me?!

46:52.010 --> 46:55.244
<i>I make all things new.</i>

46:57.282 --> 46:58.981
<i>Remember, Paul.</i>

46:59.918 --> 47:01.250
<i>Remember.</i>

47:03.154 --> 47:04.954
<i>What do you see?</i>

47:06.825 --> 47:08.291
My mother.

47:10.028 --> 47:12.161
She's getting us dressed
for something.

47:13.298 --> 47:17.567
I'm just a boy,
about six or seven.

47:18.269 --> 47:20.336
<i>Who was with you, Paul?</i>

47:21.573 --> 47:22.972
<i>A little girl.</i>

47:23.942 --> 47:25.441
About the same age as me.

47:27.545 --> 47:30.079
And a baby, boy.

47:30.081 --> 47:33.349
<i>Paul, only I am for you.</i>

47:34.185 --> 47:37.286
<i>Remember that I am for you.</i>

47:37.288 --> 47:42.124
Now we're driving, it's more
recent, like a few years ago.

47:42.126 --> 47:44.193
<i>I am for you, Paul.</i>

47:44.963 --> 47:48.865
They're arguing about
something in the front.

47:50.501 --> 47:52.034
We're about to crash.

47:53.037 --> 47:54.270
I reach over to help.

47:55.607 --> 47:58.074
The boy and girl.

47:58.076 --> 47:59.876
<i>It's okay, Paul.</i>

48:00.645 --> 48:03.946
<i>I am for you.</i>

48:04.482 --> 48:05.448
Who are you?

48:08.353 --> 48:10.887
<i>I am, Paul.</i>

48:10.889 --> 48:12.088
<i>I am.</i>

48:12.891 --> 48:15.291
<i>You're gonna bring good news.</i>

48:16.895 --> 48:19.028
<i>You're gonna bring good news.</i>

48:28.940 --> 48:31.173
<i>How could</i>
<i>you not tell me?</i>

48:31.175 --> 48:33.109
You got some serious
anger issues

48:33.111 --> 48:34.510
you need to take care of, kid.

48:34.512 --> 48:37.179
How could you not tell me?

48:37.181 --> 48:39.415
Oh, so you're actually
gonna shoot me this time?

48:39.417 --> 48:42.051
Harold, don't push him.

48:42.053 --> 48:45.421
Paul, you need to relax,
talk to us.

48:45.423 --> 48:49.091
I swear my nightmares are
better than real life lately.

48:49.928 --> 48:52.261
So what exactly
did I not tell you?

48:55.133 --> 48:58.334
The boy and girl from the raid.

48:59.070 --> 49:01.437
The last two people
I sentenced to death.

49:05.176 --> 49:07.209
They were my brother and sister.

49:08.179 --> 49:11.948
Well, look whose memory's
coming back.

49:11.950 --> 49:13.049
So you knew?

49:13.051 --> 49:14.283
Is that all you remember?

49:14.285 --> 49:16.152
Why, am I missing a few details?

49:16.154 --> 49:18.287
You're missing the fact
that you're pretending

49:18.289 --> 49:21.190
to all of a sudden care about
something you think you know.

49:23.962 --> 49:25.661
I saw them!

49:25.663 --> 49:27.296
I remember!

49:29.968 --> 49:31.534
Maybe they were at one time.

49:33.972 --> 49:35.271
But not anymore.

49:36.507 --> 49:42.578
Now they're defiants,
and you're A51-317,

49:42.580 --> 49:46.482
leader of Peace Team
Gallica 3 of Region 5,

49:46.484 --> 49:47.483
isn't that right?

49:49.220 --> 49:52.154
So why do their lives
matter to you?

49:52.156 --> 49:54.423
What makes now so different?

49:56.461 --> 49:57.593
Who are you, kid?

50:00.264 --> 50:04.066
Only you can make that decision,
but don't make it for them.

50:05.203 --> 50:08.771
You make that decision
because you know that I Am

50:08.773 --> 50:10.573
called you by name.

50:15.346 --> 50:16.612
I deserve to die.

50:19.484 --> 50:20.483
Harold.

50:23.154 --> 50:26.655
If that's what he said to you,
then pull the trigger.

50:27.759 --> 50:32.061
I know you don't think I'll
do it, but I have nothing.

50:32.697 --> 50:35.131
Everyone I have is gone.

50:35.133 --> 50:37.133
Then you should probably
pull the trigger.

50:37.135 --> 50:38.401
Harold.

50:44.509 --> 50:45.641
Would it ease your pain?

50:50.615 --> 50:52.048
No, Paul.

50:53.384 --> 50:56.052
He's always gonna
be gone in this life,

50:57.221 --> 50:59.455
and I'll always have
to face that.

51:00.525 --> 51:02.124
Please don't.

51:02.126 --> 51:03.292
<i>Paul.</i>

51:07.065 --> 51:09.165
What do you
believe in, Paul?

51:12.403 --> 51:14.603
I honestly believe
I deserve to die

51:14.605 --> 51:16.205
for the things I've done.

51:22.380 --> 51:23.579
You do.

51:27.251 --> 51:30.086
But you don't have to.

51:34.158 --> 51:36.158
That's the beauty of it.

51:41.466 --> 51:43.099
I'm so sorry.

51:45.169 --> 51:46.569
It's okay.

51:47.438 --> 51:50.106
You didn't know what
you were doing.

51:52.810 --> 51:55.244
I don't understand.

51:55.246 --> 51:57.246
You never will.

52:08.426 --> 52:11.127
Just please don't kill
any more of us.

52:25.209 --> 52:26.408
So what now?

52:29.547 --> 52:31.180
We get your sister back.

52:37.822 --> 52:39.688
Wake up, Esther.

52:40.691 --> 52:42.158
Bend your arms.

52:43.895 --> 52:45.427
Wake up, sweetheart.

52:46.764 --> 52:48.230
Bend your arms.

52:49.500 --> 52:51.400
I can't anymore.

52:51.402 --> 52:54.203
Yes, you can, come on,
don't give up on me.

52:55.673 --> 52:58.174
How can you still do this?

52:59.243 --> 53:00.643
I need water.

53:01.812 --> 53:04.313
When was the last time we ate?

53:04.315 --> 53:06.649
We just had those steaks
last night.

53:07.785 --> 53:09.251
That's not funny.

53:13.257 --> 53:15.691
Thank you, Lord,
for another day.

53:17.395 --> 53:20.296
Come on, Esther,
take a deep breath.

53:20.298 --> 53:22.765
Thank you, Lord,
for another day.

53:22.767 --> 53:24.967
Thank you, Lord,
for another day.

53:24.969 --> 53:27.269
Thank you, Lord,
for another day!

53:27.271 --> 53:28.804
Thank you, Lord,
for another day!

53:30.274 --> 53:31.707
<i>Shut up in there.</i>

53:32.944 --> 53:35.211
Thank you, Lord,
for another day.

53:36.547 --> 53:39.281
We are blessed to have
been counted worthy.

53:40.418 --> 53:43.319
I had an incredible dream
last night, Esther.

53:45.289 --> 53:46.488
They're coming.

53:48.359 --> 53:50.226
I believe they're here already.

53:52.697 --> 53:55.631
Finish strong, sweetheart,
finish strong.

53:56.701 --> 53:58.601
What, who?

53:59.337 --> 54:04.707
<i>¶ When peace like a river ¶</i>

54:05.977 --> 54:09.612
<i>¶ Attendeth my wake ¶</i>

54:09.614 --> 54:12.748
Rachel, who's here?

54:12.750 --> 54:17.653
<i>¶ When sun rose like</i>
<i>Sea billows ¶</i>

54:18.856 --> 54:19.922
I said shut up!

54:19.924 --> 54:23.325
<i>¶ But ever my light ¶</i>

54:23.327 --> 54:27.329
- Rachel.
<i>- ¶ Thou has thought me to say ¶</i>

54:27.331 --> 54:29.331
Rachel.

54:29.333 --> 54:31.300
<i>¶ It is... ¶</i>

54:34.438 --> 54:36.405
What did I say about singing?

54:36.407 --> 54:38.407
Another week without food.

54:38.409 --> 54:40.809
I had food to eat
you don't know about.

54:43.748 --> 54:44.880
Search the cell.

54:44.882 --> 54:45.981
What do I do with him?

54:45.983 --> 54:47.883
He can take her spot.

54:47.885 --> 54:49.385
She's not coming back.

54:49.387 --> 54:50.819
What are you doing?

54:50.821 --> 54:52.721
Sovereign leader isn't here yet.

54:52.723 --> 54:55.624
<i>¶ And Lord haste the... ¶</i>

54:55.626 --> 54:56.959
Rachel!

54:56.961 --> 54:59.295
You understand,
I'm not gonna have an uprising

54:59.297 --> 55:00.829
on the day we're understaffed.

55:02.466 --> 55:06.835
<i>¶ When the faith</i>
<i>Shall be sight ¶</i>

55:07.772 --> 55:08.804
Walk.

55:08.806 --> 55:10.639
Where is he taking her?

55:10.641 --> 55:11.874
Rachel!

55:45.576 --> 55:46.842
You.

55:46.844 --> 55:48.777
Here to finish what you started?

55:49.613 --> 55:52.348
What are you doing,
don't touch me.

55:52.350 --> 55:53.615
I'm so sorry.

55:53.617 --> 55:55.384
I know this doesn't
make any sense,

55:55.386 --> 55:57.519
but I need you to trust me
right now.

55:58.923 --> 56:00.723
Why would I ever trust you?

56:00.725 --> 56:03.692
'Cause you and I are
the only family we have left.

56:05.863 --> 56:09.365
You can join us or you can stay.

56:10.368 --> 56:11.800
The choice is yours.

56:11.802 --> 56:12.968
I'm in, what do you need?

56:12.970 --> 56:14.837
To leave, now.

56:19.677 --> 56:21.677
Come on.
Backup could show up anytime.

56:21.679 --> 56:23.846
We can't leave Rachel. They just
took her, we should get her.

56:23.848 --> 56:26.415
- There's no time.
- We can't leave her, they're gonna kill her!

56:26.417 --> 56:27.449
Keep your voice down.

56:27.451 --> 56:28.617
It's too late.

56:31.389 --> 56:34.556
<i>¶ It is well ¶</i>

56:34.558 --> 56:39.695
<i>¶ It is well ¶</i>

56:39.697 --> 56:43.999
<i>¶ With my soul ¶</i>

56:44.001 --> 56:46.935
<i>¶ With my soul ¶</i>

56:51.742 --> 56:53.475
<i>¶ It is well ¶</i>

56:53.477 --> 57:00.949
<i>¶ It is well with my soul ¶</i>

57:14.565 --> 57:16.031
Eat something.

57:22.072 --> 57:23.505
What's your name?

57:26.777 --> 57:29.111
Adam.

57:29.112 --> 57:31.446
I'm Paul,
that's Harold, Christina,

57:31.449 --> 57:33.515
that's my sister Esther
over there.

57:35.453 --> 57:36.952
Hi.

57:36.954 --> 57:38.921
Thanks for rescuing me.

57:38.923 --> 57:40.622
Not fully rescued yet.

57:40.624 --> 57:41.890
What's your story?

57:43.594 --> 57:45.594
My parents were survivalists.

57:45.596 --> 57:50.032
We've been hiding out,
living off whatever we could.

57:50.034 --> 57:51.066
Where are they now?

57:53.070 --> 57:54.036
Dead.

57:55.473 --> 57:58.474
We ran into
some old friends recently

57:58.476 --> 58:02.044
who had shifted their loyalties.

58:03.514 --> 58:05.013
Apparently that's legal now.

58:07.017 --> 58:08.517
They took me instead.

58:09.787 --> 58:11.653
Where do your loyalties lie?

58:12.857 --> 58:14.590
What do you mean?

58:14.592 --> 58:16.592
Why haven't you
become a citizen?

58:18.829 --> 58:22.097
My father never really
trusted him, I guess.

58:22.099 --> 58:23.098
The leader.

58:23.100 --> 58:27.503
I mean, you've heard some
of the stuff he says.

58:27.505 --> 58:28.704
Or does.

58:29.240 --> 58:31.507
Something's not right with that.

58:31.509 --> 58:32.641
Right?

58:33.611 --> 58:35.077
That's not normal behavior.

58:36.580 --> 58:37.980
Have you seen their eyes?

58:41.185 --> 58:42.952
And what's with their masks?

58:42.953 --> 58:44.720
Their leader tells them
that they're allergic to us.

58:44.722 --> 58:46.722
The serum in their mask
makes them cough,

58:46.724 --> 58:48.991
convincing them that
they're allergic to us.

58:49.727 --> 58:51.093
Their eyes are what
you look like

58:51.095 --> 58:53.695
when hope has been ripped
from your soul.

58:54.598 --> 58:55.664
It doesn't feel good.

58:55.666 --> 59:00.702
You still never answered his question, though.
Where do your loyalties lie?

59:02.640 --> 59:06.074
I guess with whoever
has answers.

59:08.312 --> 59:10.712
Like real answers.

59:13.751 --> 59:16.552
But until then, with you guys.

59:17.154 --> 59:20.556
I owe you my life,
and I have no one left.

59:21.625 --> 59:24.927
Look, this isn't
a survivalist group.

59:24.929 --> 59:29.097
We have a very specific mission that
we've been preparing for for a long time.

59:30.000 --> 59:32.868
We feel like you're better off
not being with us at this point.

59:32.870 --> 59:35.037
This is the safest
I've been in years.

59:36.774 --> 59:38.273
I'll do anything you guys want.

59:38.275 --> 59:40.175
Adam, trust me...

59:40.177 --> 59:40.776
Do you have any special skills?

59:45.783 --> 59:48.750
I'm not gonna throw an orphan
back on the street.

59:50.254 --> 59:52.020
Do you have any useful skills?

59:56.694 --> 59:58.126
I like to make stuff.

01:00:04.902 --> 01:00:05.901
Cool.

01:00:06.904 --> 01:00:08.270
Okay.

01:00:08.272 --> 01:00:09.705
Let's get started.

01:00:12.142 --> 01:00:13.141
Not you.

01:00:14.311 --> 01:00:15.711
Read this first.

01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:17.813
What is it?

01:00:20.217 --> 01:00:21.650
Answers.

01:00:26.690 --> 01:00:28.023
You want to be friends?

01:00:36.834 --> 01:00:38.967
I can't imagine how
you must feel.

01:00:43.741 --> 01:00:45.040
I feel angry.

01:00:49.179 --> 01:00:52.814
Annoyed that you expect me
to believe

01:00:52.816 --> 01:00:55.917
you couldn't recognize
your own family.

01:00:55.919 --> 01:00:57.853
I recognized you that day.

01:00:58.722 --> 01:01:01.223
As soon as you said my name,
I remembered.

01:01:02.259 --> 01:01:03.225
Something.

01:01:05.763 --> 01:01:07.029
Just not enough.

01:01:09.667 --> 01:01:11.867
Well, I suppose now
that you remember,

01:01:11.869 --> 01:01:13.902
we can just be one big
happy family again.

01:01:13.904 --> 01:01:16.838
- Es--
- Don't call me that.

01:01:33.991 --> 01:01:35.957
I don't know how to forgive you.

01:01:38.962 --> 01:01:39.961
I know.

01:01:42.433 --> 01:01:44.066
I'm not expecting you to.

01:01:48.739 --> 01:01:51.073
I've been beaten and tortured,

01:01:52.843 --> 01:01:54.943
more times
than I can even count.

01:01:58.048 --> 01:02:02.350
Today was the first time
in almost a week

01:02:02.352 --> 01:02:04.019
that I've eaten anything.

01:02:09.159 --> 01:02:13.862
And it doesn't even compare
to how it felt

01:02:15.199 --> 01:02:16.865
to watch Jacob die.

01:02:20.037 --> 01:02:22.003
I couldn't remember his name.

01:02:24.141 --> 01:02:25.173
What was he like?

01:02:30.247 --> 01:02:31.780
He was funny.

01:02:35.052 --> 01:02:36.284
Weird.

01:02:38.088 --> 01:02:40.789
The only one who ever
got your awful jokes.

01:02:46.096 --> 01:02:50.799
And he looked up to you
way more than he should've.

01:02:52.770 --> 01:02:55.070
You did a great job
looking out for him.

01:02:56.507 --> 01:02:59.841
All alone, I can't imagine.

01:03:01.245 --> 01:03:03.245
Just sucks, you know.

01:03:05.315 --> 01:03:06.915
Feels like they've won.

01:03:08.385 --> 01:03:11.253
Didn't Mom used to say
something about losing?

01:03:14.992 --> 01:03:19.027
If you pick the right team,
you'll never lose.

01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:21.062
Yeah.

01:03:21.064 --> 01:03:26.067
And then Dad would say,
"unless you picked the losers."

01:03:28.405 --> 01:03:29.871
Do you remember him?

01:03:31.408 --> 01:03:32.841
No, not at all.

01:03:35.245 --> 01:03:36.244
What was he like?

01:03:38.282 --> 01:03:39.948
You're not missing much.

01:03:44.221 --> 01:03:45.253
You're not so bad.

01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:51.092
For a little brother.

01:03:52.596 --> 01:03:54.429
Are you the oldest?

01:03:54.431 --> 01:03:56.031
I could probably convince you

01:03:56.033 --> 01:03:58.099
of anything at this
point, couldn't I?

01:04:00.571 --> 01:04:02.003
We have a problem.

01:04:03.307 --> 01:04:05.473
- Well, he's back in town.
- So what's the problem?

01:04:05.475 --> 01:04:09.845
All the authentication for the notification systems changed after the seal.

01:04:09.847 --> 01:04:12.147
We didn't account for them
switching the system that fast.

01:04:12.149 --> 01:04:15.116
- You didn't account for it.
- I'm sorry, again.

01:04:15.118 --> 01:04:17.352
- Meaning what?
- Meaning we have no way

01:04:17.354 --> 01:04:19.921
of notifying the public
when it's live anymore,

01:04:19.923 --> 01:04:21.923
and I have no idea
where to start hacking,

01:04:21.925 --> 01:04:23.391
because
none of us have the seal.

01:04:23.393 --> 01:04:25.927
So I don't even know what
technology they used.

01:04:25.929 --> 01:04:28.163
Caden, that's still not English.

01:04:28.165 --> 01:04:30.198
We can put it up, but
nobody'll know about it

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:32.868
- before they take it down again.
- So what are our options?

01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:35.470
Short of him stepping up
to the podium on live TV

01:04:35.472 --> 01:04:38.173
and telling the world he
changed his mind about us?

01:04:38.175 --> 01:04:40.175
We're pretty much up a creek.

01:04:41.545 --> 01:04:44.045
Caden, after it goes live,
how long do we have

01:04:44.047 --> 01:04:45.213
before they take it down?

01:04:45.215 --> 01:04:47.148
Maybe three minutes, five tops?

01:04:47.150 --> 01:04:49.251
So we just get to the
podium, would that work?

01:04:49.253 --> 01:04:53.388
Yeah, 'cause they rent
that out on the weekend.

01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:56.358
No, if he had me.

01:04:59.196 --> 01:05:01.963
You said yourself, if he had me,

01:05:01.965 --> 01:05:04.065
he would want to do it
on live television.

01:05:05.602 --> 01:05:06.935
Paul.

01:05:08.005 --> 01:05:09.938
Yes or no, would it work?

01:05:12.476 --> 01:05:14.109
Kid.

01:05:14.111 --> 01:05:15.944
Would he do it live?

01:05:16.947 --> 01:05:18.980
The world would demand it,
but you can't.

01:05:18.982 --> 01:05:20.448
Would it save lives?

01:05:21.251 --> 01:05:24.352
This is some kind of penance?

01:05:24.354 --> 01:05:27.088
That you can risk your life
and earn forgiveness?

01:05:27.090 --> 01:05:28.623
I'm not doing it to be forgiven.

01:05:28.625 --> 01:05:31.192
I'm not losing another m--

01:05:35.065 --> 01:05:39.067
Kid, I'm not losing another
member of this team.

01:05:42.506 --> 01:05:44.973
Maybe you all don't remember,

01:05:44.975 --> 01:05:47.442
but it's still
really fresh for me.

01:05:49.046 --> 01:05:53.515
I know what it's like
to live blinded by hate

01:05:54.551 --> 01:05:56.151
and think I know love.

01:05:57.220 --> 01:05:59.721
To kill and destroy
and think you're doing

01:05:59.723 --> 01:06:01.256
the work of a god.

01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:07.095
Don't they deserve a chance
to know the truth?

01:06:08.432 --> 01:06:10.632
Was this only the plan
if it didn't put

01:06:10.634 --> 01:06:12.334
any of us in any danger?

01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:17.172
Do we value our lives so much
that we're gonna stand here

01:06:18.041 --> 01:06:20.041
and watch them
walk off the cliff?

01:06:22.346 --> 01:06:23.411
Or do we jump?

01:06:25.382 --> 01:06:29.050
Do we jump and hope to God
we can fall fast enough

01:06:29.052 --> 01:06:31.987
to get there first
and soften the blow.

01:06:36.059 --> 01:06:41.463
Look, if everyone does
their job right,

01:06:41.465 --> 01:06:43.031
I'll be home for dinner.

01:06:45.135 --> 01:06:49.637
- Do we still have that watch Reggie used at my house?
- Yeah, I've got it.

01:06:49.639 --> 01:06:54.075
- Can you and Adam add more power to it?
- Oh, yeah, like a lot.

01:06:54.077 --> 01:06:57.445
As soon as I'm done giving my speech,
I need to get out of there.

01:06:57.447 --> 01:07:01.249
- Yeah, I got it.
- Caden, have you charged my phone since being back?

01:07:01.251 --> 01:07:04.452
Yeah, but as soon as you
turn it on, they'll swarm.

01:07:04.454 --> 01:07:05.687
I'm counting on it.

01:07:05.689 --> 01:07:08.690
I need you to get as far away
from here as you can.

01:07:08.692 --> 01:07:10.492
In the opposite direction.

01:07:10.494 --> 01:07:14.262
As soon as you have,
turn this on.

01:07:15.499 --> 01:07:17.365
We play our cards right,
it'll buy us

01:07:17.367 --> 01:07:19.634
a few extra minutes
before they get here.

01:07:22.239 --> 01:07:24.539
Everyone should start
packing now.

01:07:24.541 --> 01:07:29.144
Even if this works,
they'll find this place.

01:07:29.146 --> 01:07:31.046
Nobody's safe here anymore.

01:07:35.652 --> 01:07:38.653
Es, it's gonna be okay.

01:07:38.655 --> 01:07:40.388
I have to do this.

01:07:41.525 --> 01:07:42.657
I know.

01:07:45.062 --> 01:07:47.162
I hope you know
what you're doing.

01:07:51.668 --> 01:07:53.301
I'm proud of you.

01:07:54.638 --> 01:07:56.171
Jacob would be too.

01:07:58.208 --> 01:07:59.574
I'll see you soon.

01:08:00.811 --> 01:08:02.343
Hey.

01:08:03.246 --> 01:08:05.213
You know I love you, right?

01:08:05.849 --> 01:08:07.348
No matter what.

01:08:10.854 --> 01:08:12.654
Thanks for not giving up on me.

01:08:21.298 --> 01:08:23.363
I'll see you later.

01:08:31.341 --> 01:08:33.174
Thanks for everything, guys.

01:08:45.122 --> 01:08:47.287
Please don't let my brother
risk his life

01:08:47.791 --> 01:08:49.524
without telling him the truth.

01:09:16.153 --> 01:09:17.285
I'm sorry.

01:09:18.255 --> 01:09:20.188
For everything.

01:09:22.692 --> 01:09:23.725
Don't be.

01:09:44.381 --> 01:09:46.247
How close is it to
being uploaded?

01:09:46.249 --> 01:09:48.349
I'm not exactly working
with broadband out here.

01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:50.585
If we can't get this up
it was all for nothing.

01:09:50.587 --> 01:09:51.786
I understand the stakes.

01:09:51.787 --> 01:09:52.787
Guys.

01:09:55.859 --> 01:09:57.792
That's not our only problem.

01:10:06.770 --> 01:10:08.336
You have a visitor.

01:10:19.216 --> 01:10:20.348
Hello, Paul.

01:10:26.823 --> 01:10:28.623
It's immensely good to see you.

01:10:39.836 --> 01:10:41.736
Did you know this was his plan?

01:10:42.672 --> 01:10:43.771
No.

01:10:44.874 --> 01:10:46.708
I'm not surprised though.

01:10:49.312 --> 01:10:51.279
Let's get right to the point.

01:10:54.985 --> 01:10:58.386
I am nothing if not
a god of mercy.

01:11:00.857 --> 01:11:05.560
I'd like to offer you
your old life back, in full.

01:11:10.033 --> 01:11:12.400
We'll let the past be the past.

01:11:15.405 --> 01:11:17.272
What will you tell the world?

01:11:18.742 --> 01:11:19.741
The truth.

01:11:19.743 --> 01:11:23.811
That you were framed for my
death by my administration

01:11:23.813 --> 01:11:28.549
to create an opportunity to
explain my power to the world.

01:11:31.021 --> 01:11:32.654
And if I refuse?

01:11:36.626 --> 01:11:37.592
Don't.

01:11:38.361 --> 01:11:39.594
We have to help him.

01:11:39.596 --> 01:11:40.495
Esther.

01:11:40.497 --> 01:11:43.031
We can't leave him.

01:11:43.033 --> 01:11:44.599
He'll never make it out.

01:11:45.302 --> 01:11:47.468
There was a time not long ago

01:11:47.470 --> 01:11:49.604
where I would've done
anything for you.

01:11:50.907 --> 01:11:53.574
Would've given my life
without thinking twice.

01:11:55.712 --> 01:11:57.845
All I wanted was
my old life back.

01:12:01.318 --> 01:12:03.584
That was before I understood
who you are.

01:12:08.758 --> 01:12:09.857
And who am I?

01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:15.563
Do you know why
I chose you, A51?

01:12:17.667 --> 01:12:20.535
I didn't choose you because
your mother was taken.

01:12:21.037 --> 01:12:25.106
Or because you climbed the
ranks of the peace teams.

01:12:25.108 --> 01:12:28.476
I chose you to be
the face of my immortality

01:12:28.478 --> 01:12:32.447
because you have known
nothing but the new world.

01:12:33.650 --> 01:12:38.519
And that youthful naivety
is what I knew

01:12:38.521 --> 01:12:40.955
would keep you faithful
even when the whole world

01:12:40.957 --> 01:12:42.490
turned its back on you.

01:12:45.729 --> 01:12:48.129
You chose me because
I was broken.

01:12:48.131 --> 01:12:49.530
Yes.

01:12:50.567 --> 01:12:52.767
But only to display my power.

01:12:53.837 --> 01:12:56.604
To show the world
how I can fix you.

01:13:01.144 --> 01:13:03.811
I'm not broken anymore.

01:13:10.387 --> 01:13:11.953
We'll see about that.

01:13:13.723 --> 01:13:16.924
Before you make your decision,
can I show you something?

01:13:23.733 --> 01:13:25.566
We'll give you a few minutes.

01:13:32.909 --> 01:13:35.476
What are you doing here?

01:13:35.478 --> 01:13:36.811
Figured you'd miss me.

01:13:39.849 --> 01:13:42.417
I'm not making it out
of here alive, Harold.

01:13:42.952 --> 01:13:44.419
Never was.

01:13:45.522 --> 01:13:46.988
I know, Paul.

01:13:47.757 --> 01:13:50.591
Do you remember burying a
little wooden box with your mom

01:13:50.593 --> 01:13:51.759
when you were a boy?

01:13:51.761 --> 01:13:53.161
I don't have time for this.

01:13:53.163 --> 01:13:54.629
We can still get
you out of here.

01:13:54.631 --> 01:13:56.964
Paul William Wooden.

01:14:00.203 --> 01:14:01.803
Answer my question.

01:14:04.641 --> 01:14:05.640
Yeah.

01:14:07.043 --> 01:14:08.609
By a big oak tree.

01:14:09.746 --> 01:14:11.913
A soy bean field
behind the house.

01:14:13.917 --> 01:14:15.850
Do you remember what
you buried in the box?

01:14:15.852 --> 01:14:18.019
No, not everything's
come back to me.

01:14:18.021 --> 01:14:19.153
I need you to remember.

01:14:19.155 --> 01:14:20.621
I can't.

01:14:20.623 --> 01:14:21.956
Don't you think I've tried?

01:14:21.958 --> 01:14:23.524
Paul.

01:14:23.526 --> 01:14:25.993
Think.

01:14:38.741 --> 01:14:39.740
The key?

01:14:44.481 --> 01:14:47.682
To this day, I could
never understand

01:14:47.684 --> 01:14:51.886
why someone would bury the key
to a box inside the box.

01:14:53.490 --> 01:14:56.023
That woman would do
the weirdest things.

01:14:58.795 --> 01:15:00.094
Man, I miss her.

01:15:03.199 --> 01:15:05.533
You knew my mother?

01:15:06.703 --> 01:15:08.503
How could you not say anything?

01:15:09.138 --> 01:15:14.709
I tried to stay close to you,
to look after you. I did.

01:15:14.711 --> 01:15:18.579
I found any way I could to
insert myself into your life.

01:15:19.682 --> 01:15:22.783
I didn't think you were ever
gonna remember anything.

01:15:23.853 --> 01:15:25.920
Until you mentioned that dream.

01:15:27.724 --> 01:15:29.757
<i>I had this dream.</i>

01:15:29.759 --> 01:15:32.593
You had giant eagle wings.

01:15:33.630 --> 01:15:38.699
You were carrying me
upside down by your talons.

01:15:40.570 --> 01:15:42.937
Every time I wore that
eagle sweatshirt,

01:15:43.773 --> 01:15:46.641
you would ask me to pick you up
and spin you around

01:15:46.643 --> 01:15:50.578
upside down,
and screech like a bird.

01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:52.847
Every time I came to
your house for a checkup,

01:15:52.849 --> 01:15:55.883
I thought my heart was going
to leap out of my chest.

01:15:57.320 --> 01:16:01.889
To see you in so much pain,
to watch you

01:16:01.891 --> 01:16:04.091
being filled with so much hate.

01:16:07.330 --> 01:16:09.797
Just wasn't the boy
I remembered.

01:16:42.198 --> 01:16:43.798
Who are you?

01:16:46.669 --> 01:16:49.971
I'm the person who's
failed you the most, son.

01:16:50.974 --> 01:16:55.009
But I had to know that you were
defiant for yourself first,

01:16:55.878 --> 01:16:58.779
and not just to have
a family again.

01:17:02.652 --> 01:17:05.620
<i>You don't have to</i>
<i>do this anymore.</i>

01:17:14.330 --> 01:17:15.730
You're...

01:17:18.101 --> 01:17:19.834
I'm so sorry, Paul.

01:17:25.842 --> 01:17:28.809
Aren't family reunions
beautiful?

01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:33.314
I was gonna mention the connection between father and son

01:17:33.316 --> 01:17:37.985
after my assassination,
but the public tends to sympathize with family,

01:17:37.987 --> 01:17:40.988
and that wouldn't really
help me any.

01:17:42.025 --> 01:17:44.191
Have you made your
decision yet, A51?

01:17:49.699 --> 01:17:51.298
Eternity awaits.

01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:53.668
We have another problem.

01:17:55.371 --> 01:17:57.672
- We've got company.
- Do they know we're back here?

01:17:57.674 --> 01:17:59.974
I don't know, but if they keep coming,
they're gonna know really quick.

01:17:59.976 --> 01:18:02.276
- What can we do?
- Adam, they're jamming my signal.

01:18:02.278 --> 01:18:03.244
I'm almost done.

01:18:09.018 --> 01:18:13.120
See, Paul, I would never
treat you like that.

01:18:14.857 --> 01:18:16.891
I would treat you like a prince.

01:18:18.461 --> 01:18:20.928
Like a son deserves
to be treated.

01:18:22.732 --> 01:18:26.400
If I join you, what's
gonna happen to him?

01:18:26.402 --> 01:18:27.301
Paul.

01:18:27.303 --> 01:18:28.969
What happens to him?

01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:34.008
He would be given the option
to join us as well.

01:18:35.278 --> 01:18:36.310
All are welcome.

01:18:38.347 --> 01:18:40.715
We only want peace.

01:18:44.020 --> 01:18:45.853
Why do you even want me back?

01:18:46.456 --> 01:18:50.224
Because getting the rebel
who betrayed me to come back,

01:18:50.226 --> 01:18:53.728
it's the ultimate display
of my redemptive power.

01:18:55.064 --> 01:18:58.199
If you join us,
the whole world will see

01:18:58.201 --> 01:19:04.138
that I have the power to change
even the darkest of hearts.

01:19:07.110 --> 01:19:11.812
He couldn't get Judas
to come back, but I can.

01:19:14.817 --> 01:19:19.053
See, you don't want peace.

01:19:22.892 --> 01:19:24.525
You want submission.

01:19:24.527 --> 01:19:26.360
They're the same thing.

01:19:27.497 --> 01:19:29.897
Only if you choose
the right side.

01:19:29.899 --> 01:19:32.299
News flash, Paul, I win!

01:19:32.301 --> 01:19:36.303
To me, every knee will bow,
every tongue confess.

01:19:37.006 --> 01:19:39.306
So what's it gonna be, A51?

01:19:39.308 --> 01:19:41.041
Will you join us?

01:19:42.178 --> 01:19:43.878
Or does daddy die?

01:20:02.131 --> 01:20:06.534
The key inside the box,
she told me the way in

01:20:06.536 --> 01:20:08.936
is what needs to be protected.

01:20:12.408 --> 01:20:16.911
If you don't protect the key,
anything can get inside.

01:20:19.048 --> 01:20:22.817
It's for you first,
and then the rest of the world.

01:20:25.054 --> 01:20:26.954
You did what you had to, Dad.

01:20:32.261 --> 01:20:35.362
I'm so proud of you, son.

01:20:35.364 --> 01:20:37.097
You're gonna bring good news.

01:20:40.303 --> 01:20:41.902
You can do this.

01:20:43.039 --> 01:20:44.371
I'll see you soon.

01:20:45.241 --> 01:20:47.908
We need to get this as
close to them as possible,

01:20:47.910 --> 01:20:50.377
and them as far away
from us as possible.

01:20:59.455 --> 01:21:00.421
Is it on?

01:21:17.173 --> 01:21:21.876
Es, I love you like
you're my own.

01:21:23.913 --> 01:21:26.013
I'm so proud of you.

01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:14.461
If we live, we live to the Lord.

01:22:15.398 --> 01:22:19.066
Or if we die,
we die to the Lord.

01:22:19.068 --> 01:22:23.203
If therefore we live or die,
we are the Lord.

01:22:24.173 --> 01:22:27.441
If we live, we live to the Lord,

01:22:27.443 --> 01:22:30.477
or if we die,
we die to the Lord.

01:22:30.479 --> 01:22:35.582
If therefore we live or die,
we are the Lord.

01:22:35.584 --> 01:22:38.152
If we live, we live to the Lord,

01:22:38.154 --> 01:22:40.454
or if we die,
we die to the Lord.

01:22:40.456 --> 01:22:45.092
If therefore we live or die,
we are the Lord.

01:22:45.094 --> 01:22:47.962
If we live, we live to the Lord,

01:22:47.964 --> 01:22:51.065
or if we die,
we die to the Lord.

01:22:51.067 --> 01:22:55.035
If therefore we live or die,
we are the Lord.

01:22:55.705 --> 01:22:58.572
Caden, we have to go, now.

01:22:58.574 --> 01:22:59.974
Guys.

01:23:01.444 --> 01:23:02.543
I've got it.

01:23:15.224 --> 01:23:18.459
I figured I'd give you a second
to enjoy your defiance.

01:23:20.196 --> 01:23:24.098
Let you feel like
you might just win.

01:23:29.472 --> 01:23:35.509
For if we live, we live to
the Lord, or if we die...

01:23:41.017 --> 01:23:42.216
Why, Paul?

01:23:45.021 --> 01:23:46.487
I was so good to you.

01:23:49.458 --> 01:23:52.159
I offered you everything
you ever wanted.

01:23:55.097 --> 01:23:56.764
I can redirect the domain's IP.

01:23:56.766 --> 01:23:58.098
Explain quick.

01:23:58.100 --> 01:23:59.600
Okay, when this first started,

01:23:59.602 --> 01:24:01.668
we bought server space
all over the place

01:24:01.670 --> 01:24:03.771
not knowing what we'd need.

01:24:03.773 --> 01:24:05.639
Meaning I can change
the IP address

01:24:05.641 --> 01:24:08.242
to each of the servers
as they find them.

01:24:08.244 --> 01:24:10.611
Whatever site we send them to
will always be the same,

01:24:10.613 --> 01:24:14.381
- but behind the scenes it's constantly changing!
- Caden, that's brilliant.

01:24:14.383 --> 01:24:17.117
It's basic DNS, how did we
not think of this before?

01:24:17.119 --> 01:24:19.119
How much longer will that
keep the site up for?

01:24:19.121 --> 01:24:21.188
Minutes, maybe days.

01:24:25.261 --> 01:24:27.327
It's completely in his control.

01:24:28.431 --> 01:24:30.631
This is the last
thing we can do.

01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:36.603
Now, what he wants the world
to know, they'll know.

01:24:40.276 --> 01:24:41.642
<i>Paul.</i>

01:24:44.113 --> 01:24:45.612
<i>You've done well.</i>

01:24:47.716 --> 01:24:50.084
<i>I will hold them back.</i>

01:24:52.822 --> 01:24:56.256
<i>I am for you.</i>

01:24:57.860 --> 01:25:01.862
- Go.
- Caden.

01:25:01.864 --> 01:25:04.598
There's no use in them
getting all of us.

01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:06.200
Go.

01:25:06.202 --> 01:25:09.103
At the very least I have
to see if this works.

01:25:30.392 --> 01:25:33.127
Tell everyone you can find
how brave I was.

01:26:43.799 --> 01:26:46.200
My name's Paul Wooden.

01:26:46.936 --> 01:26:48.602
I'm not the killer
they say I am.

01:26:50.306 --> 01:26:51.738
That really doesn't matter.

01:26:53.475 --> 01:26:55.742
What matters is that
there's nothing to fear.

01:26:57.413 --> 01:26:59.546
What matters is that
there's still hope.

01:27:02.518 --> 01:27:04.284
The same hope that
was written about

01:27:04.286 --> 01:27:06.820
thousands of years ago
exists today.

01:27:08.224 --> 01:27:10.257
My friends and I have
risked our lives

01:27:10.259 --> 01:27:12.593
to try and give you hope.

01:27:12.595 --> 01:27:16.230
We've been working for a long time...

01:27:16.232 --> 01:27:17.698
...to put the forbidden book
online

01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:20.500
at iamdefiant.net
if you want it.

01:27:21.003 --> 01:27:22.669
God willing,
it's live right now.

01:27:23.839 --> 01:27:27.374
As long as the site's up, they
can't track your download,

01:27:28.277 --> 01:27:29.776
but it won't be up for long.

01:27:29.778 --> 01:27:33.914
They'll take it down because they don't want you to have hope.

01:27:34.717 --> 01:27:37.884
They'll take it down because
your leader quotes this book

01:27:37.886 --> 01:27:39.653
as though it's his own words.

01:27:42.858 --> 01:27:44.791
My name's Paul William Wooden.

01:27:46.962 --> 01:27:48.528
And I am defiant.

01:27:50.566 --> 01:27:51.732
Who are you?

01:28:55.097 --> 01:28:56.830
They don't have the seal.

01:29:09.044 --> 01:29:10.610
Who are all these people?

01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:13.814
What are you doing here?

01:29:13.816 --> 01:29:15.549
He told us to come here.

01:29:16.852 --> 01:29:17.884
Who?

01:29:19.088 --> 01:29:20.821
The man

01:29:20.823 --> 01:29:22.956
with holes in his hands.

01:29:22.958 --> 01:29:24.858
He told us you'd be here.

01:29:26.395 --> 01:29:28.562
You're the ones who
released the book.

01:29:35.037 --> 01:29:38.805
I was told to give you this,
when the time was right.

01:30:33.128 --> 01:30:35.695
I know very few things for sure.

01:30:42.471 --> 01:30:44.504
I know my name is Esther Wooden.

01:30:47.776 --> 01:30:51.044
I know the peace this world
claims to have is a lie.

01:30:54.450 --> 01:30:57.017
I know the man with
holes in his hands well,

01:30:58.520 --> 01:31:00.987
the one who came to many
of you in dreams,

01:31:02.658 --> 01:31:05.459
the one their leader
pretends to be.

01:31:07.896 --> 01:31:10.730
The one the forbidden book
is written about.

01:31:13.669 --> 01:31:17.537
If you're standing here,
I know you've been through

01:31:17.539 --> 01:31:19.539
a great deal.

01:31:19.541 --> 01:31:24.711
You've fought, you've lost much.

01:31:25.948 --> 01:31:27.981
You've barely scraped by.

01:31:31.820 --> 01:31:33.920
But your fight can
be for something.

01:31:33.922 --> 01:31:35.021
Can you teach us?

01:31:37.493 --> 01:31:38.625
How to fight.

01:31:39.962 --> 01:31:41.561
No more fighting.

01:31:42.898 --> 01:31:44.965
I can teach you
how to surrender.

01:31:47.102 --> 01:31:48.768
It's how you win the fight.

01:31:49.972 --> 01:31:54.508
Surrender to the one
my brothers died for,

01:31:55.244 --> 01:32:00.881
the one my father died for,
my friends fought and died for.

01:32:02.184 --> 01:32:03.917
His name is Jesus.

01:32:05.587 --> 01:32:10.090
And this book,
it's called The Bible.

01:32:12.694 --> 01:32:17.731
It's the true story of the
old world, and the new.

01:32:21.003 --> 01:32:25.038
I'm not gonna lie to you,
if you choose to live by it,

01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:27.107
you will lose a great deal more.

01:32:30.012 --> 01:32:33.613
Perhaps everything you have
will be taken from you.

01:32:35.083 --> 01:32:36.917
But you'll have everything.

01:32:37.653 --> 01:32:40.020
I don't know much,
but I know that.

01:32:41.623 --> 01:32:44.124
I know that I have everything.

01:32:50.098 --> 01:32:52.866
He who didn't spare his own son,

01:32:52.868 --> 01:32:55.168
but delivered him up for us all,

01:32:56.838 --> 01:33:01.741
how would he not also with him
freely give us all thanks?

01:33:05.113 --> 01:33:07.013
So who are you?

01:33:08.817 --> 01:33:11.952
You'll have to make
that decision at some point.

01:33:11.954 --> 01:33:15.956
Decide now for yourself,
but don't do it for anyone else.

01:33:17.793 --> 01:33:21.361
It's for you first,
then the rest of the world.

01:33:21.363 --> 01:33:23.663
It has to be in that order.

01:33:27.369 --> 01:33:29.002
I am defiant.

01:33:33.742 --> 01:33:35.008
So who are you?

01:33:43.251 --> 01:33:47.687
I am defiant!

01:33:48.690 --> 01:33:51.825
What then shall we say
about these things?

01:33:51.827 --> 01:33:55.762
If God is for us,
who can be against us?

01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:00.166
We are defiant.

01:34:01.269 --> 01:34:02.702
We are many.

01:34:10.979 --> 01:34:12.012
And we win.
