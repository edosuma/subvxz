WEBVTT

00:06.256 --> 00:09.801
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:17.600 --> 00:18.435
Which means...

00:19.310 --> 00:23.690
Third Class Hisone Amakasu will officially
participate in the flight training.

00:23.898 --> 00:26.151
-She has been promoted.
-Where's Nao?

00:26.609 --> 00:29.863
My name is Hisone Amakasu.
Looking forward to working with you.

00:30.280 --> 00:32.615
At least you have manners.

00:32.699 --> 00:34.242
Yes! I will give it my best!

00:34.451 --> 00:38.413
A rehearsal for the air show celebration
will be held this weekend,

00:38.705 --> 00:41.666
but joint training with the OTF
can be held at any time.

00:41.750 --> 00:43.376
Aww, seriously?

00:43.460 --> 00:46.671
Taking time away from ACM
will hurt us, won't it, Slope?

00:46.755 --> 00:49.632
That's 'cause Castle and I just got here.

00:50.467 --> 00:54.137
What do you think, Long?
Is she on your radar?

00:54.220 --> 00:55.972
Give me a break, Eel...

00:56.514 --> 00:59.350
<i>Castle? Long? Eel?</i>

00:59.601 --> 01:00.727
<i>Why English?</i>

01:01.061 --> 01:02.771
<i>Are they all returnees from abroad?</i>

01:02.896 --> 01:04.147
You know,

01:04.397 --> 01:07.567
my phased array is normally solid
as a rock.

01:08.026 --> 01:09.402
But for some reason...

01:10.153 --> 01:11.529
it doesn't make contact!

01:13.740 --> 01:17.285
Is that what they mean?
I should be initiated in as a newcomer,

01:17.368 --> 01:19.704
but it's just sexual harassment!

01:19.829 --> 01:21.581
Oh no! Was that sexual harassment?

01:21.664 --> 01:22.749
No, you're safe!

01:22.832 --> 01:25.585
Forest would always crack up
at those jokes.

01:25.668 --> 01:27.921
If Forest could handle it, then it's safe!

01:28.630 --> 01:30.965
-Forest?
-She was a beauty that was like us.

01:31.049 --> 01:34.928
That's the TAC name of your predecessor,
Former First Lieutenant Moriyama.

01:35.261 --> 01:38.848
-Predecessor?
-The Dragon Pilot, three years ago.

01:39.349 --> 01:41.226
Your <i>senpai.</i>

01:41.351 --> 01:42.393
Enough! Shut up!

01:42.477 --> 01:45.522
<i>Senpai </i>Dragon Pilot?

01:46.356 --> 01:50.944
DRAGON PILOT: Hisone & Masotan

03:38.676 --> 03:40.845
<i>Mambo Viking 01 FTCS.</i>

03:40.970 --> 03:42.847
<i>The rear serpent is lagging.</i>

03:42.972 --> 03:45.099
<i>Up the speed and catch up with the others.</i>

03:46.559 --> 03:47.936
<i>You're too slow, Amakasu!</i>

03:48.353 --> 03:50.563
Cutting 200 knots at 30,000 feet.

03:50.647 --> 03:51.856
You trying to stall us?!

03:52.023 --> 03:55.526
Maybe, if you praised my flying skills
when I fly well--

03:55.610 --> 03:56.778
<i>What'd you say?</i>

03:58.404 --> 04:00.490
Not that one!

04:12.794 --> 04:14.545
<i>Oh, no. Zetton! Longtail!</i>

04:14.837 --> 04:16.214
<i>Brakes! Hit the brakes!</i>

04:35.066 --> 04:37.068
-That was risky.
-What a close call.

04:37.151 --> 04:39.320
<i>Cancel the training! Cancel!</i>

04:39.404 --> 04:41.322
<i>What the hell was that, Amakasu?</i>
<i>You idiot!</i>

04:41.406 --> 04:42.824
<i>I-I'm sorry!</i>

04:42.907 --> 04:46.619
<i>But if you keep yelling,</i>
<i>I'll shrink and disappear--</i>

04:46.703 --> 04:47.829
<i>What'd you say?</i>

04:47.912 --> 04:49.497
<i>Oh... you heard that?</i>

04:49.580 --> 04:52.500
<i>Your mic is hot, dumbass!</i>

04:53.710 --> 04:54.877
The prospects are grim...

04:56.504 --> 04:57.380
Oh, boy.

04:57.714 --> 05:00.633
I wonder if we can even practice
for the air show.

05:01.092 --> 05:05.388
<i>-</i>Wanna just go do the ACM, ourselves?
<i>-I don't have enough fuel.</i>

05:05.763 --> 05:07.598
RTB immediately!

05:07.724 --> 05:09.726
Amakasu, you come after.

05:09.976 --> 05:11.144
<i>God dammit!</i>

05:11.519 --> 05:13.771
<i>Think of a TAC name, too!</i>

05:14.022 --> 05:15.606
TAC name?

05:15.815 --> 05:19.277
Oh yeah, Flight Leader Kakiyasu
mentioned that this morning.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.284
Masotan?

05:26.868 --> 05:28.369
Is there something wrong?

05:32.081 --> 05:34.250
Sorry, I don't understand you.

05:35.793 --> 05:40.757
I wonder if your old Dragon Pilot,
Moriyama, knows or did something.

05:42.884 --> 05:44.886
Ah! My suit!

06:06.366 --> 06:07.992
Wait a minute!

06:40.400 --> 06:42.735
Nao, what are you up to?

06:44.278 --> 06:45.571
GIFU AIR BASE AIR SHOW

06:45.696 --> 06:48.449
Flight Leader Kakiyasu
mentioned that, this morning.

06:48.825 --> 06:52.537
But what does sewing have to do
with the air show?

06:52.620 --> 06:54.622
Like, I'm gonna tell you.

06:54.831 --> 06:57.500
For OTF crew, who can't do anything
the day of the show,

06:57.583 --> 07:00.753
we're supposed to do something,
within our power, to contribute!

07:00.920 --> 07:01.963
Oh, I see.

07:02.171 --> 07:05.258
Unfortunately, I became
an established Dragon Pilot.

07:05.591 --> 07:08.094
But Nao has found a spectacular way
to fill my void.

07:08.219 --> 07:09.053
I respect you.

07:11.097 --> 07:13.474
You... you're definitely my enemy!

07:13.724 --> 07:14.725
Aww, why?

07:14.809 --> 07:17.478
I was just assessing your value,
in comparison to me!

07:17.562 --> 07:19.355
What? Shut the hell up!

07:19.605 --> 07:22.108
-What is this "standard value" crap?!
-Oh yeah, Nao,

07:22.191 --> 07:24.152
did you know the former Dragon Pilot?

07:24.277 --> 07:26.320
-From three years ago.
-I don't know!

07:26.404 --> 07:28.030
I don't give a damn about quitters!

07:28.614 --> 07:32.827
-What about you, Okonogi?
-I was assigned here only last year.

07:33.161 --> 07:34.537
I see.

07:35.246 --> 07:38.583
Apparently,
they called her Forest Moriyama.

07:40.626 --> 07:42.170
You scared me!

07:44.172 --> 07:45.006
Masotan?

07:45.548 --> 07:50.386
Oh, I see. The TAC name
of the person before was Forest.

07:52.638 --> 07:56.267
I heard something at the briefing,
this morning, that got my attention.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.478
What is a TAC name?

07:58.895 --> 08:03.232
It's something like an individual nickname
that each pilot has.

08:03.608 --> 08:04.609
A nickname.

08:04.692 --> 08:08.571
Usually, the higher-ups or your <i>senpai</i>
gives it to you, so you can't reject it.

08:08.696 --> 08:12.742
Oh, maybe Moriyama was called Forest
because it's part of her name.

08:18.498 --> 08:19.499
Moriyama.

08:22.001 --> 08:22.835
Forest.

08:26.047 --> 08:27.089
Amakasu!

08:29.342 --> 08:32.845
How sad. Should I give you a TAC name?

08:32.929 --> 08:35.723
Let's keep "kasu" from Amakasu,
so we can call you Crap!

08:35.932 --> 08:37.517
Oh yeah, Forest.

08:37.892 --> 08:40.478
She had both these and these.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.772
No, that's not what I wanna know.

08:42.855 --> 08:45.358
-Where is she now?
-Three, two, one, break!

08:45.525 --> 08:47.610
She quit at some point.

08:47.693 --> 08:49.278
-Huh?
-She didn't even say bye.

08:49.403 --> 08:53.282
When I was stationed at Tsuiki, I heard
a Gifu Dragon Pilot went on a flight

08:53.366 --> 08:55.701
and never came back.

08:55.826 --> 08:56.994
So, does that mean--

08:57.078 --> 08:58.579
High G Yo-Yo!

08:58.746 --> 09:00.456
You're not Komatsu!

09:00.540 --> 09:03.834
If you can't do this much,
the Gifu Air Show will be obsolete.

09:03.918 --> 09:04.835
Seriously?

09:04.961 --> 09:06.003
He's got the spirit!

09:06.087 --> 09:07.838
As should of the flight launch leader!

09:07.922 --> 09:10.508
Let's pull it off with one shot!

09:10.716 --> 09:11.676
Yeah!

09:13.219 --> 09:14.512
Bravissimo!

09:15.263 --> 09:16.931
It melted through impressively.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.392
I'll go ahead with the data collection.

09:19.517 --> 09:22.186
Feel free to let it dissolve
as much as you want.

09:25.273 --> 09:27.525
I see you're still at 14 inches.

09:27.733 --> 09:31.696
Do you know someone
by the nameÂ Moriyama?

09:31.821 --> 09:32.863
Moriyama?

09:32.947 --> 09:35.908
They say she was a Dragon Pilot, here,
three years ago.

09:38.119 --> 09:41.163
That was a terribly unfortunate event.

09:41.622 --> 09:44.500
She was a testee
for my special prototype suits,

09:44.584 --> 09:47.837
and I had made an especially
sensational design for her.

09:49.463 --> 09:52.049
It had cleanly and entirely melted off.

09:52.508 --> 09:53.843
You were referring to the--

09:54.844 --> 09:56.846
Mr. Ikushima, what do you think?

09:59.890 --> 10:02.393
I was hoping more than the arm
would move, too,

10:02.476 --> 10:04.478
-but it is what it is.
-Thanks!

10:04.645 --> 10:06.314
We'll line it with the battery...

10:06.397 --> 10:09.275
<i>No one's interested</i>
<i>in the old Dragon Pilot.</i>

10:09.358 --> 10:11.569
Just a single line! How impressive!

10:11.652 --> 10:15.072
GIFU AIR BASE AIR SHOW

10:16.449 --> 10:19.160
You don't have to push yourself to come.

10:19.493 --> 10:21.579
Another day is fine to meet her.

10:24.665 --> 10:25.750
All right.

10:25.875 --> 10:27.293
I'll see you on Sunday.

10:31.422 --> 10:34.258
Please, no personal calls in here.

10:34.383 --> 10:39.013
Constructing a harmonious relationship
with one's juniors is a justifiable act.

10:39.096 --> 10:40.848
She's a civilian now.

10:40.931 --> 10:44.226
Junior-senior relations last a lifetime.

10:46.437 --> 10:48.856
She didn't have to quit.

10:49.190 --> 10:51.275
There should've been a way
for her to return.

10:52.068 --> 10:55.029
Her handling of transport aircraft
stood out, above the rest.

10:55.738 --> 10:57.448
What a waste of talent.

11:05.122 --> 11:06.123
Amakasu.

11:11.212 --> 11:12.046
Forest.

11:18.094 --> 11:20.096
Just, who is that?

11:20.680 --> 11:21.889
Moriyama...

11:21.972 --> 11:26.477
<i>Hiso Maso.</i>

11:30.064 --> 11:33.192
<i>Please, turn your attention</i>
<i>to the left field.</i>

11:33.567 --> 11:35.778
<i>Now, the aircraft formation</i>
<i>of Gifu Air Base</i>

11:36.529 --> 11:40.950
<i>and the "Aviation Meteor Shower."</i>
<i>Please, enjoy!</i>

11:46.288 --> 11:49.792
<i>After their performance,</i>
<i>the formation will disperse</i>

11:49.875 --> 11:51.877
<i>in preparation for the next program.</i>

11:57.383 --> 11:58.300
What do you think?

11:58.634 --> 12:01.554
This is my personal contribution.

12:02.638 --> 12:04.557
You couldn't do this, could ya?

12:04.974 --> 12:09.603
Yeah. I'm jealous that you can
think of this as a contribution.

12:10.020 --> 12:11.439
Ouch!

12:12.189 --> 12:14.483
Look, it's waving!

12:15.526 --> 12:16.360
Pilot!

12:16.444 --> 12:17.945
Mm-hmm, very good!

12:22.032 --> 12:23.242
Oh my!

12:24.034 --> 12:26.370
He sounds a bit on edge...

12:29.415 --> 12:31.584
I wonder if she's related
to a crewman.

12:31.667 --> 12:32.585
Who?

12:32.668 --> 12:36.422
Technical Sergeant Amakasu!
I need you to come with me.

12:39.341 --> 12:42.428
Blue Impulse isn't coming
to this year's air show.

12:43.471 --> 12:46.432
And Misawa's F-16 isn't coming, either.

12:47.224 --> 12:50.853
Which means, all eyes will be on Gifu.

12:51.270 --> 12:52.104
And...

12:52.188 --> 12:55.274
The last air maneuver in the program,
that Onaga put together,

12:55.357 --> 12:59.570
was supposed to shock all the fans
from around the country, but--

12:59.779 --> 13:00.613
But?

13:01.030 --> 13:02.615
What Onaga hadn't expected,

13:03.240 --> 13:05.868
was the engine to go out!

13:06.744 --> 13:09.163
The other 15s aren't available,

13:09.371 --> 13:11.540
and there are no extra ones
in maintenance.

13:12.041 --> 13:14.043
We have to cancel it.

13:14.418 --> 13:16.462
No! We can't let that happen.

13:16.837 --> 13:17.671
Why's that?

13:17.922 --> 13:18.881
Because...

13:18.964 --> 13:25.596
the plane failed after getting caught
in the OTF's slipstream, the other day,

13:25.721 --> 13:26.639
or so we think.

13:27.056 --> 13:27.890
Huh?

13:27.973 --> 13:30.476
It's the same plane we used in training.

13:30.559 --> 13:31.393
What?!

13:31.644 --> 13:35.981
The OTF's slipstream is of a higher
temperature and pressure than normal,

13:36.106 --> 13:38.526
which, most likely, damaged
the interior shaft.

13:38.818 --> 13:41.946
It's nothing but a miracle
that it didn't kill the engine.

13:42.071 --> 13:43.405
Could it be...

13:44.615 --> 13:48.244
that's what Masotan
was trying to tell me?

13:51.872 --> 13:53.916
Um, in other words...

13:54.208 --> 13:56.502
You're taking responsibility.

13:56.627 --> 13:57.795
Commander Sosoda?

13:57.878 --> 13:58.712
No way!

13:59.004 --> 14:00.714
R-Responsibility?!

14:02.550 --> 14:03.968
Don't worry, Amakasu.

14:05.219 --> 14:06.136
You can fly it.

14:06.428 --> 14:07.680
-What?
-I'm sorry.

14:07.763 --> 14:09.723
-But--
-We're counting on you, Amakasu.

14:09.807 --> 14:11.934
-You can do it!
-Land those tricks!

14:13.060 --> 14:14.645
You're the face of Gifu!

14:16.021 --> 14:18.107
<i>I'm the face... of Gifu?</i>

14:21.902 --> 14:22.945
I understand.

14:23.487 --> 14:25.322
I'm just a mere Dragon Pilot,

14:25.698 --> 14:27.950
but I must rise to the occasion.

14:28.409 --> 14:30.077
I'll give you the best I've got!

14:30.744 --> 14:32.454
As Gifu's representative... No.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.415
As the face of Gifu!

14:41.297 --> 14:42.131
It's all over...

14:42.882 --> 14:44.466
Gifu's dignity...

14:44.967 --> 14:48.220
and the photo shoot with models,
after the flight...

14:48.304 --> 14:50.723
I'm gonna pretend like I didn't hear that.

14:51.307 --> 14:55.019
He usually comes out
when I wear this suit...

14:55.769 --> 14:56.604
This...

14:57.354 --> 14:58.898
This is how it ends.

15:00.232 --> 15:02.276
Mama'll be sad.

15:02.359 --> 15:03.819
Here comes that accent of his.

15:04.445 --> 15:07.323
Came 'ere all da way from Kyushu, ya know!

15:09.158 --> 15:10.618
She thunk I were gonna fly!

15:10.701 --> 15:14.204
Came all da way ter see me!

15:14.288 --> 15:17.499
Unleashing your accent
and rattling on won't--

15:17.583 --> 15:19.084
Oscar!

15:21.003 --> 15:22.254
Oscar!

15:22.630 --> 15:24.798
O-Oscar?

15:28.093 --> 15:29.219
Good to see you again!

15:29.678 --> 15:32.181
-Have you been well?
-Flight Leader Kakiyasu,

15:32.264 --> 15:33.390
should she be in here?

15:33.515 --> 15:35.726
It's fine. I called her.

15:38.562 --> 15:42.650
You were just trembling like a baby,
but now you're all better!

15:43.525 --> 15:46.904
He always gets moody when there are
crowds of people, like today.

15:47.363 --> 15:50.032
I could hear him crying from Hangar 8.

15:51.784 --> 15:54.411
<i>The woman I saw earlier?</i>

15:55.329 --> 15:57.539
Zaito, were you picking on him again?

15:57.706 --> 15:58.874
You shouldn't do that.

15:59.291 --> 16:01.710
Um, excuse me, but do I know you?

16:02.336 --> 16:03.629
Oh, you're so funny.

16:04.129 --> 16:05.714
It's me!

16:05.965 --> 16:07.591
Moriyama.

16:11.178 --> 16:13.180
What?!

16:14.348 --> 16:16.517
She was a former Dragon Pilot?

16:16.767 --> 16:19.103
-You're kidding.
-That doesn't even look like her!

16:19.395 --> 16:22.606
She's a mom through and through
to this little guy.

16:23.107 --> 16:26.026
Senpai, didn't you tell them?

16:26.235 --> 16:27.486
Senpai?

16:27.653 --> 16:29.822
She was my junior,
flying transport aircraft.

16:30.572 --> 16:33.617
I invited her because she wanted
to meet the new Dragon Pilot.

16:33.867 --> 16:35.619
So you're the Dragon Pilot, now?

16:35.786 --> 16:38.205
Oh my gosh, you're straw thin!

16:38.288 --> 16:39.289
S-So...

16:39.748 --> 16:42.584
-you quit being a Dragon Pilot because--
-Mama!

16:42.710 --> 16:44.294
I was pregnant.

16:45.879 --> 16:48.048
Pardon me, but it's about time...

16:49.883 --> 16:51.677
I'd ride if I could,

16:51.927 --> 16:53.429
but look at me!

16:54.054 --> 16:55.222
There's no way I could!

16:58.892 --> 17:00.894
-Please.
-Huh?

17:01.937 --> 17:03.939
If you know how to get him to swallow me,

17:04.106 --> 17:05.774
then, please, teach me!

17:06.400 --> 17:09.903
As my predecessor,
it is your duty to teach me!

17:11.030 --> 17:13.741
And what's with "Oscar?"
Sounds too simple.

17:14.199 --> 17:16.827
He's got a name and it's Masotan!

17:17.119 --> 17:19.288
And you, Masotan!

17:19.621 --> 17:22.666
How can you hate Otofu
and be okay with Oscar?!

17:23.292 --> 17:25.586
And about Onaga's aircraft,

17:26.170 --> 17:29.006
if only you had spelled things out for me,

17:29.089 --> 17:30.424
I would've known how to--

17:32.760 --> 17:33.677
Why?

17:33.886 --> 17:35.345
Why, indeed.

17:35.471 --> 17:37.347
I dun git what's happening,

17:37.431 --> 17:38.265
but he did it!

17:38.557 --> 17:40.601
Great! To the mobile control!

17:40.934 --> 17:41.977
There's no time!

17:42.311 --> 17:45.189
We'll taxi the OTF directly out!

17:45.689 --> 17:48.108
-Let's get going, too.
-<i>Mrs. Moriyama!</i>

17:48.734 --> 17:52.571
<i>Once this is over, will you create</i>
<i>a TAC name for me?</i>

17:53.030 --> 17:54.114
Okay!

17:55.449 --> 17:57.076
This may seem small,

17:58.535 --> 18:01.330
but doesn't it look odd
without a pilot in the dummy cockpit?

18:02.498 --> 18:04.083
<i>Thank you for your patience.</i>

18:04.792 --> 18:06.585
<i>The final adjustments have been made,</i>

18:07.127 --> 18:09.588
<i>and Gifu Air Base's F-15 Eagle</i>

18:10.255 --> 18:12.424
<i>will arrive on the runway, shortly.</i>

18:16.303 --> 18:17.471
Oh dear.

18:18.430 --> 18:22.226
<i>Our final program is presented</i>
<i>by the Air Development and Test Wing.</i>

18:22.768 --> 18:25.604
<i>A maneuver aviation performance</i>
<i>by the F-15J.</i>

18:26.230 --> 18:30.109
<i>We hope you'll enjoy</i>
<i>this stunning solo flight</i>

18:30.192 --> 18:31.777
<i>by an experienced pilot.</i>

18:45.499 --> 18:46.917
M-Masotan?

18:51.004 --> 18:52.047
Huh?

18:52.297 --> 18:53.882
The output is failing?

18:58.512 --> 19:01.223
We've come this far, so let's just fly.

19:01.306 --> 19:03.350
I'll reward you with lots of food after!

19:09.273 --> 19:11.984
Would you do it for Mrs. Moriyama?

19:12.067 --> 19:13.777
Only if it were Forest?!

19:14.403 --> 19:20.909
<i>If you think I could bear your attachment</i>
<i>to my predecessor, then you're mistaken!</i>

19:21.577 --> 19:26.665
Getting some blunt troublemaker to do this
was your choice!

19:26.748 --> 19:29.459
I said, I'd do it, so take responsibility!

19:30.878 --> 19:35.716
You might think, talking about
your responsibilities isn't important,

19:36.091 --> 19:37.718
but are you really okay with that?!

19:39.052 --> 19:40.429
The output!

19:40.721 --> 19:42.723
You might be fine with that,

19:43.307 --> 19:45.726
but try visualizing what'll happen to me!

19:45.809 --> 19:47.978
Looking dejected, in front of everyone.

19:48.061 --> 19:51.607
Just imagine the look I'd have on my face!

19:51.982 --> 19:52.858
That sucks, right?

19:53.442 --> 19:55.652
So please, Masotan,

19:56.195 --> 19:59.281
fly for me!

20:18.050 --> 20:19.009
Beautiful takeoff.

20:19.343 --> 20:21.970
Damn you!

20:25.849 --> 20:27.392
Did the gears rise?

20:27.684 --> 20:29.394
-They're in!
-And the flaps?

20:29.478 --> 20:31.396
-They're returning, as normal!
-Yes!

20:38.403 --> 20:40.030
Aren't they a little too into it?

20:40.113 --> 20:42.324
I've never seen moves like that before.

20:42.616 --> 20:44.743
Has Gifu been hiding this?

20:44.868 --> 20:47.120
Such mobility, to this degree...

21:08.433 --> 21:10.686
I lied about the reason why I quit.

21:11.770 --> 21:14.940
It was actually because
Oscar wouldn't let me ride him anymore.

21:15.315 --> 21:19.736
That's not a reason for giving up flying
and running off with a man.

21:19.820 --> 21:22.322
Don't say it like that.

21:23.490 --> 21:26.034
Are you still peeved at me
for stealing him?

21:26.201 --> 21:27.828
Don't be ridiculous.

21:29.162 --> 21:30.539
I let you have him.

21:33.083 --> 21:34.418
Sweet.

21:37.087 --> 21:41.633
Senpai, how would you say the "kasu"
from Amakasu in English?

21:44.511 --> 21:46.847
You really are simple.

21:50.851 --> 21:53.770
I don't like hearing that
from you, Persimmon.

22:01.278 --> 22:03.071
Cheers!

22:03.322 --> 22:06.867
I will now reveal Amakasu's TAC name!

22:06.950 --> 22:08.827
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

22:13.790 --> 22:14.624
Ta-da!

22:24.760 --> 22:27.346
Ma... so... ta... n!

22:33.477 --> 22:35.479
My TAC name is...

22:37.022 --> 22:38.273
Hisone!

22:38.440 --> 22:39.816
Hi... so... ne!

22:44.237 --> 22:46.031
Remember it, Masotan!

22:46.531 --> 22:49.910
TO BE CONTINUED

24:20.500 --> 24:22.377
<i>You gonna do it or not?</i>

24:22.461 --> 24:24.671
<i>Munch and gulp.</i>

24:24.754 --> 24:26.173
<i>-La la la.</i>
<i>-There it is.</i>

24:26.256 --> 24:28.133
<i>-Is it slippery?</i>
<i>-No, it's not.</i>

24:28.216 --> 24:31.511
<i>Sexy... jaguar!</i>

24:31.595 --> 24:33.597
<i>It's, really, not slippery!</i>

24:41.897 --> 24:44.900
