15:04.237 --> 15:05.904
- [laughs]

15:05.906 --> 15:09.407
"score some drugs."
wow.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.643
- Come one, help me out.

15:11.645 --> 15:14.045
You must hear things.

15:14.047 --> 15:16.414
- I have not
and never will have cause

15:16.416 --> 15:19.050
To answer that question, dad.

15:35.067 --> 15:36.467
- I'm taking the kids
to lunch.

15:36.469 --> 15:39.938
I was checking to see
if you wanted to come.

15:39.940 --> 15:41.539
- Where you going?

15:41.541 --> 15:45.610
- I don't know.
Lobster roll probably.

15:45.612 --> 15:48.046
- Um, no, thanks.

15:48.048 --> 15:50.114
I'm gonna work.

15:52.017 --> 15:53.685
- Okay.

16:04.096 --> 16:06.130
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

16:10.302 --> 16:12.704
Whitney wants her phone back.
- No.

16:12.706 --> 16:15.373
- Her therapist says it's okay.
- Then definitely not.

16:17.309 --> 16:19.444
- She wants us
to go in there with her.

16:19.446 --> 16:24.082
- Where, to therapy?
Do we have to?

16:24.084 --> 16:28.252
- I don't think
it's such a bad idea for us.

16:28.254 --> 16:29.654
- "for us"?

16:29.656 --> 16:33.591
- Yeah, you've been
kind of distant lately.

16:33.593 --> 16:35.593
- I'm sorry, helen.
It's just--it's just this book.

16:35.595 --> 16:38.396
- And you don't want
to fuck me anymore.

16:43.402 --> 16:47.105
- Of course I do.

16:47.107 --> 16:51.075
Is that what this
is about?

16:51.077 --> 16:54.145
Come here.
Come here.

16:59.284 --> 17:01.085
- I feel old.

17:01.087 --> 17:02.420
Do I look old?

17:02.422 --> 17:05.390
- No, you look incredible.

17:05.392 --> 17:08.493
I look old.

17:08.495 --> 17:11.295
- I'm still a great lay, right?
- Are you kidding?

17:11.297 --> 17:15.199
You're the best lay.
- [chuckles]

17:18.037 --> 17:21.572
[sniffles]
so why aren't we having sex?

17:24.243 --> 17:26.711
- Because we--we got four kids.

17:26.713 --> 17:29.247
We're--we're staying
with your parents.

17:29.249 --> 17:31.716
- Let's do it tonight.
- Tonight?

17:31.718 --> 17:34.552
- Yeah.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.454
I'll have my parents
take the kids out to dinner,

17:36.456 --> 17:40.124
And we can stay home, okay?

17:40.126 --> 17:42.326
- I'd love that.

17:42.328 --> 17:43.828
- Deal?
- Mm-hmm.

17:43.830 --> 17:47.131
- Okay.

17:47.133 --> 17:49.300
I'm gonna buy a candle.

17:49.302 --> 17:51.669
- Okay, but not sage.
- I like sage.

17:51.671 --> 17:53.604
- I know you like sage,
but you're allergic.

17:53.606 --> 17:55.606
- Just a little bit.

18:05.551 --> 18:08.419
- Yeah, then you should color
your lobster blue.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.421
- They aren't blue.
They're red!

18:10.423 --> 18:11.722
Mom, tell him
he's wrong!

18:11.724 --> 18:13.558
- I'm not wrong.
I'm more advanced!

18:13.560 --> 18:15.293
- Hey, guys, stop.

18:15.295 --> 18:16.761
You keep fighting,
I'll take away the crayons.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.729
- Hey, solloways.
Both: Uncle max!

18:18.731 --> 18:20.298
- I didn't know you
invited max.

18:20.300 --> 18:21.599
- Yeah, is that a problem?
- No.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.568
- Helen the felon.
- Hello.

18:23.570 --> 18:24.769
- Come here.

18:24.771 --> 18:27.605
- Mom, dad is right there.

18:27.607 --> 18:30.208
- Whitney, come on.
- Sorry.

18:30.210 --> 18:31.876
You missed a hell of a party
last night, by the way.

18:31.878 --> 18:33.444
- Yes, I heard.

18:33.446 --> 18:34.879
Noah didn't get home
until after 5:00.

18:34.881 --> 18:36.781
- 5:00?
Damn, solloway.

18:36.783 --> 18:39.350
Keeping the party up
without me?

18:39.352 --> 18:40.852
- Hello.
- Hi.

18:40.854 --> 18:43.454
- Welcome back,
my favorite family.

18:43.456 --> 18:45.223
Can I get you guys
something to drink?

18:45.225 --> 18:47.191
- Yes, I don't know
about these little hooligans,

18:47.193 --> 18:48.593
But me and that old man

18:48.595 --> 18:50.394
Are gonna have a couple
bloody marys, please.

18:50.396 --> 18:51.796
- No, no, I can't.
- No, go ahead, do it.

18:51.798 --> 18:53.364
I'll drive.
- May I have a bloody mary?

18:53.366 --> 18:56.200
- When I'm dead.
- I want to drink blood.

18:56.202 --> 19:00.404
Blah!
- Stop. Leave her alone.

19:00.406 --> 19:05.209
- Isn't that what's-her-name
from last night?

19:05.211 --> 19:07.211
She was all over me.
What is her name, again?

19:07.213 --> 19:10.248
- Alison.

19:10.250 --> 19:11.816
I'm good with names.

19:11.818 --> 19:14.619
- Hmm.
- You know what?

19:14.621 --> 19:16.654
I think I'm gonna ask
madam alison

19:16.656 --> 19:18.422
On a <i>rendezvous avec moi.</i>

19:18.424 --> 19:20.258
- Oh, come on, max,
you can do better than that.

19:20.260 --> 19:22.293
- Hey, helen, I'm not trying
to drive her off the lot.

19:22.295 --> 19:24.562
I'm just hoping for a little
spin around the neighborhood.

19:24.564 --> 19:27.265
- She's taken.
- What?

19:27.267 --> 19:29.700
- She's married, you idiot.
- She is?

19:29.702 --> 19:30.935
- She told me last night.

19:30.937 --> 19:33.371
- Huh.

19:33.373 --> 19:35.940
She wasn't acting
very married.

19:35.942 --> 19:38.676
- Maybe she's
in an open relationship.

19:38.678 --> 19:41.312
- Whitney.
- What?

19:41.314 --> 19:43.648
Grandma said when she was young
and grandpa was in vietnam--

19:43.650 --> 19:47.818
- Whitney, shh!
Stop talking right now.

19:47.820 --> 19:50.521
- Mommy, I need to go
to the bathroom.

19:50.523 --> 19:54.425
- Why don't you let
daddy take you?

19:54.427 --> 19:56.928
Daddy?

19:56.930 --> 19:59.230
- Sure, come on.

20:04.670 --> 20:05.736
- I'm gonna go too.

20:05.738 --> 20:07.605
Lock the door, okay?

20:16.949 --> 20:18.883
[knock at door]

20:18.885 --> 20:20.685
Done already?

20:25.224 --> 20:26.891
- Shh.

20:35.834 --> 20:37.602
- [mouthing words]

20:37.604 --> 20:38.970
- [chuckles]

20:47.846 --> 20:48.879
[knock at door]

20:48.881 --> 20:50.915
- Daddy, I'm done.

20:54.586 --> 20:57.588
- Hey, you ready
to go back?

20:57.590 --> 20:59.523
Let's go, come on.

21:11.470 --> 21:14.739
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I...

21:14.741 --> 21:17.608
[crying]

21:17.610 --> 21:19.010
God, I...

21:19.012 --> 21:20.778
I started talking
about val and the boys

21:20.780 --> 21:22.880
And just, um...

21:26.885 --> 21:28.386
Turned into sad max, huh?

21:28.388 --> 21:29.887
- It's okay.
- No, it's not.

21:29.889 --> 21:31.889
- It's okay.

21:31.891 --> 21:33.958
- Thanks, angel.
Thank you.

21:36.395 --> 21:38.896
You know, kids, um,
your parents

21:38.898 --> 21:40.765
Have been keeping
a very big secret from you.

21:40.767 --> 21:43.367
- What kind of secret?

21:43.369 --> 21:44.969
- Is it okay if I tell 'em?

21:49.775 --> 21:52.343
Your parents are, uh...

21:53.779 --> 21:55.513
Your parents are aliens.

21:55.515 --> 21:57.381
- Really?
- They are?

21:57.383 --> 21:59.050
- I'm sorry to tell you that,
but they're aliens,

21:59.052 --> 22:03.821
And they come from a planet
on the edge of the universe,

22:03.823 --> 22:06.791
Where the sky is green

22:06.793 --> 22:09.660
And, um...

22:12.564 --> 22:13.998
[laughs]

22:14.000 --> 22:15.633
Marriages work.

22:31.717 --> 22:33.718
- Thanks.
Lunch was great.

22:33.720 --> 22:35.886
- I'm glad
it was up to your standards.

22:35.888 --> 22:38.556
- Listen, man, I'm sorry about
what happened at the butlers'.

22:38.558 --> 22:42.360
You just caught us
at a lousy time, you know?

22:49.368 --> 22:51.702
- Max wants to take us
all mini-golfing.

22:51.704 --> 22:53.571
- What, now?
- Why not?

22:53.573 --> 22:56.107
- Well, I wanted to do some work
this afternoon.

22:56.109 --> 22:57.708
- Yeah, I figured.

22:57.710 --> 22:59.110
I told him
you wouldn't be interested,

22:59.112 --> 23:00.578
So we're gonna
take the minivan,

23:00.580 --> 23:01.779
And you can take his car.

23:04.483 --> 23:06.584
- Okay, if that's
what you want to do.

23:06.586 --> 23:08.819
- Mm-hmm.
See you later.

23:19.865 --> 23:21.499
- Hey, man,
what are you doing right now?

23:21.501 --> 23:23.067
You want to get that drink?

23:23.069 --> 23:25.035
I'd still like to pick
your brains about the town,

23:25.037 --> 23:27.538
Hear some stories.

23:27.540 --> 23:29.607
- All right, sure.

23:35.147 --> 23:38.082
She's cute, isn't she?
- Oh, um--

23:38.084 --> 23:40.885
- I used to bang her.
- Yeah?

23:40.887 --> 23:43.621
- It's true,
back in high school--

23:43.623 --> 23:47.191
Popped her cherry.

23:47.193 --> 23:50.928
[sighs] so tell me
about this book you're writing.

23:50.930 --> 23:52.930
- Um...

23:52.932 --> 23:56.066
It's a romance of sorts.

23:56.068 --> 23:57.635
- Romance?

23:57.637 --> 23:59.570
Not my genre of choice,
but okay.

23:59.572 --> 24:01.138
- Well, it's
a crime story too.

24:01.140 --> 24:02.840
- Now we're talking.

24:02.842 --> 24:05.910
So who's screwing who?

24:05.912 --> 24:08.446
- Well, the guy is a--
he's a broker from the city,

24:08.448 --> 24:09.647
And the woman is a--

24:09.649 --> 24:11.048
- Oh, fuck me.

24:11.050 --> 24:13.784
- Hey, oscar,
mr. Solloway.

24:13.786 --> 24:15.953
What a surprise.
I didn't know you two were pals.

24:15.955 --> 24:18.189
- Oscar's helping me
with a book I'm writing.

24:18.191 --> 24:21.225
- You sure do have a knack
for making new friends.

24:21.227 --> 24:23.527
Hey, do you mind
if we talk for a minute?

24:23.529 --> 24:24.862
- I would love to,
but as you can see,

24:24.864 --> 24:29.233
I'm already engaged
in a conversation.

24:29.235 --> 24:31.669
- You owe me money, hodges.
- Yeah.

24:31.671 --> 24:36.607
You owe me a permit,
asshole.

24:36.609 --> 24:38.809
- Okay.

24:41.213 --> 24:44.949
- Hey.

24:44.951 --> 24:46.951
Hey, hey.

24:46.953 --> 24:49.086
Scotty.

24:49.088 --> 24:51.889
What the fuck
are you doing, man?

24:57.562 --> 24:59.230
Excuse me.

24:59.232 --> 25:03.501
[door opens]

25:03.503 --> 25:05.669
[door closes]

25:06.705 --> 25:08.072
Hey!

25:14.846 --> 25:16.213
Hey!

25:27.526 --> 25:28.926
Excuse me, dora.

25:31.863 --> 25:33.230
Go, go!

25:35.534 --> 25:39.737
Yeah, I'd like to report
some suspicious activity.

25:39.739 --> 25:42.172
Blue water
taxi dispatch.

25:42.174 --> 25:45.309
Yeah. No, just, uh,
there's some shady characters

25:45.311 --> 25:47.044
Heading over there
from the fishing docks

25:47.046 --> 25:48.812
At some strange hours.

25:48.814 --> 25:51.749
Yeah, drugs most likely
coming off the fishing boats.

25:51.751 --> 25:53.284
Yeah, that's exactly
what I'm thinking.

25:53.286 --> 25:55.152
It's a plague
on our community, sir.

25:55.154 --> 25:56.720
Bye.

26:01.826 --> 26:03.761
Another round?
- No, thank you.

26:03.763 --> 26:07.231
- You sure?

26:07.233 --> 26:08.632
- What was all that about?

26:08.634 --> 26:10.935
- Fucking dealers, man.
- Who?

26:10.937 --> 26:12.636
- The lockharts.

26:12.638 --> 26:15.205
They own that ranch
out towards the lighthouse.

26:15.207 --> 26:18.075
It's a front.

26:18.077 --> 26:19.910
They're as dirty as dirt.

26:19.912 --> 26:22.046
Their great-grandfather
ran a bootleg operation.

26:22.048 --> 26:24.181
It's fucking hereditary.

26:24.183 --> 26:26.050
Put that in your book.

26:26.052 --> 26:28.252
Use their names.

27:02.120 --> 27:04.288
- Hey.

27:04.290 --> 27:07.825
Can I speak to you
for a second?

27:07.827 --> 27:09.293
- Yeah.

27:14.366 --> 27:16.233
What are you doing here?

27:16.235 --> 27:18.969
Anyone could see us.

27:18.971 --> 27:20.137
- Who are you?

27:20.139 --> 27:21.972
- What?

27:21.974 --> 27:23.240
- You been dealing drugs?

27:23.242 --> 27:26.110
- Excuse me?

27:26.112 --> 27:28.412
- I saw you bike
to the docks this morning.

27:28.414 --> 27:30.714
I saw you pick up the cooler
and drop it off at the taxi.

27:30.716 --> 27:34.118
- What, you were
following me?

27:34.120 --> 27:36.286
You need to go.
- Just tell me it's not true.

27:36.288 --> 27:37.888
Just tell me I'm crazy,
and I'll leave.

27:37.890 --> 27:39.723
I'll pretend
we never had this conversation.

27:39.725 --> 27:42.893
- You're crazy.

27:42.895 --> 27:45.863
- Oscar called the police.

27:45.865 --> 27:48.666
- How do you know?
- Because I was there.

27:48.668 --> 27:50.401
I saw him do it.

27:50.403 --> 27:53.203
- What'd he say?

27:53.205 --> 27:57.941
- Oh, what does it matter--
- tell me what he said.

27:57.943 --> 28:01.178
- You're a drug dealer?

28:01.180 --> 28:04.081
- I hate that word.

28:04.083 --> 28:06.216
- I trusted you.

28:06.218 --> 28:08.218
I put my whole life
into your hands.

28:08.220 --> 28:10.754
- Noah, you're tired.

28:10.756 --> 28:13.057
Go home.

28:13.059 --> 28:14.958
I'll call you later.

28:19.030 --> 28:21.899
Cole!
- Yeah?

28:21.901 --> 28:23.767
- Oscar told the police.
We have to go now.

28:23.769 --> 28:25.035
Right now!
- Got it!

28:25.037 --> 28:27.371
Hey, we got to go!

28:27.373 --> 28:29.073
Oscar narked us out.

28:29.075 --> 28:31.241
- I'll meet you
back here, okay?

28:31.243 --> 28:34.044
Back here.

28:34.046 --> 28:37.214
- Dad?

28:37.216 --> 28:39.183
What are you doing here?

28:50.361 --> 28:52.930
- Get a lot
of writing done today?

28:55.366 --> 28:58.135
- Come here.
Come here.

28:58.137 --> 28:59.803
- What's wrong?
- Come here.

28:59.805 --> 29:01.472
- What's the matter?
What?

29:12.484 --> 29:15.119
What are you doing?
Everybody's home.

29:15.121 --> 29:16.787
- Fuck that.
Let them hear it.

29:19.958 --> 29:23.060
Oh, god,
you smell so good.

29:27.899 --> 29:29.133
- I missed you.

29:29.135 --> 29:30.501
- I missed you.
- I really missed you.

29:30.503 --> 29:33.103
- I really missed you.

29:35.106 --> 29:37.107
[both moan]

30:28.560 --> 30:31.028
- [sighs]

30:46.377 --> 30:48.579
[urine splashing]

30:48.581 --> 30:52.549
Really?
- Too soon?

31:07.365 --> 31:09.266
- Noah?

31:17.242 --> 31:18.342
- Gotcha!
- Ah!

31:18.344 --> 31:20.944
[both laugh]

31:23.114 --> 31:24.514
- Gotcha.

31:24.516 --> 31:28.285
Were you worried?
- No.

31:28.287 --> 31:31.655
- Did I scare you?
- Oh, shit, I have to go.

31:31.657 --> 31:34.491
- What, you got somewhere
to be at 10 to 5:00?

31:36.961 --> 31:38.629
- Yeah.

31:49.374 --> 31:51.241
Will?

31:58.917 --> 32:01.451
Hey.
Where's will?

32:35.420 --> 32:38.288
Hey.

32:38.290 --> 32:40.424
Who's that?

32:40.426 --> 32:43.060
Caleb, who is that?

32:43.062 --> 32:44.728
- No idea.

32:44.730 --> 32:46.330
- Really?

32:46.332 --> 32:49.166
- Victoria, maybe?
Vanessa?

32:49.168 --> 32:52.636
- You fucked her?
- Of course not, no.

32:52.638 --> 32:54.604
I'm married.

32:54.606 --> 32:57.674
Relax, relax, relax.
She's comatose.

33:24.068 --> 33:27.070
- You know, uh,
will wasn't there this morning.

33:27.072 --> 33:28.605
- What do you mean?

33:28.607 --> 33:30.674
- On the boat.

33:30.676 --> 33:33.243
There was someone new.

33:33.245 --> 33:34.778
- It's will's boat.

33:34.780 --> 33:38.382
- I know, but I'm telling you,
he wasn't on it.

33:38.384 --> 33:41.218
- Oh.
That's weird.

33:41.220 --> 33:44.721
- Yeah, it is.

33:53.231 --> 33:56.233
[horse neighs]

34:00.638 --> 34:02.806
What's her name?
- Elizabeth taylor.

34:02.808 --> 34:05.709
- Oh, yeah,
I see the resemblance.

34:05.711 --> 34:07.377
- You know, I've been
married long enough to know

34:07.379 --> 34:08.645
It's not the greatest idea
in the world

34:08.647 --> 34:10.113
To compare your wife
to a horse,

34:10.115 --> 34:12.382
But she does remind me
of you.

34:12.384 --> 34:14.284
- Really?
- Yeah, absolutely.

34:14.286 --> 34:16.787
She's majestic,
she's stubborn,

34:16.789 --> 34:18.588
And she likes apples.

34:18.590 --> 34:20.424
[clicking tongue]
come on.

34:20.426 --> 34:22.626
- Come on, let's show the lady
to her room.

34:25.797 --> 34:29.066
Ready for occupancy,
my lady.

34:39.277 --> 34:42.279
[horse neighs]

34:44.849 --> 34:46.750
- Martin.

34:49.087 --> 34:50.353
Martin.

34:58.429 --> 35:00.630
- Ah, shit.

35:02.700 --> 35:06.603
I just wanted to help
with the new horse, I swear.

35:06.605 --> 35:09.306
Please don't tell
my parents.

35:16.214 --> 35:18.715
- Martin, I got
to ask you something,

35:18.717 --> 35:21.284
And it's important, so I need
you to be straight with me.

35:25.323 --> 35:28.291
Have you had breakfast yet?

35:34.465 --> 35:36.199
- You want some eggs?
- Yes, please.

35:36.201 --> 35:38.201
- Better eat up--we're gonna
put you to work today.

35:38.203 --> 35:39.469
- You can take my work,
little man.

35:39.471 --> 35:40.737
- More?
- Yeah.

35:40.739 --> 35:42.472
- Would you like
some more juice, sweetie?

35:42.474 --> 35:44.774
- Yeah.
- Martin, my man.

35:44.776 --> 35:46.643
- Oh, hey, buddy.
- Hi.

35:46.645 --> 35:49.546
- Now, martin, it is wonderful
to have you here this morning,

35:49.548 --> 35:53.483
But may I ask where your parents
think you are right now?

35:53.485 --> 35:55.385
- Like they care.

35:55.387 --> 35:56.686
- What?

35:56.688 --> 35:59.222
- That was a joke.
Um, I left them a note.

35:59.224 --> 36:00.624
- Good.

36:00.626 --> 36:02.359
Your dad, noah,
seems like an interesting guy.

36:02.361 --> 36:03.527
- What's he do?

36:03.529 --> 36:04.828
- He's a teacher.

36:04.830 --> 36:06.763
He's pretty lame.

36:06.765 --> 36:08.632
- Well, why is it lame
to be a teacher?

36:08.634 --> 36:10.300
- I don't know.

36:10.302 --> 36:12.235
It's just--
it's not like what you guys do.

36:12.237 --> 36:13.770
- I was a teacher
when I was young.

36:13.772 --> 36:15.438
- World's greatest teacher ever.

36:15.440 --> 36:17.574
- Thank you. First grade.
- Sorry.

36:17.576 --> 36:19.276
- That's all right.

36:19.278 --> 36:21.444
- Maybe he's not lame
because he's a teacher.

36:21.446 --> 36:23.547
Maybe he's just lame
because he's your dad.

36:23.549 --> 36:25.682
- Maybe.
- And speaking of teaching,

36:25.684 --> 36:27.450
You will never guess
who I ran into.

36:27.452 --> 36:29.186
That little redhead
who was in your class

36:29.188 --> 36:32.389
The year that dad died,
that had a crush on hal.

36:37.261 --> 36:40.263
[phone ringing]

36:45.603 --> 36:47.837
- Hello?

36:47.839 --> 36:50.874
Mrs. Solloway?

36:50.876 --> 36:55.312
Yes, martin's here.
He's fine.

36:55.314 --> 36:58.248
No, we just had breakfast.

37:00.284 --> 37:04.221
No, the boys wanted him early
to help with a new mare.

37:04.223 --> 37:06.823
I'm...

37:06.825 --> 37:09.259
I'm sorry
to concern you.

37:12.363 --> 37:14.297
You're very welcome.

37:14.299 --> 37:15.966
You too.

37:15.968 --> 37:18.835
Good-bye.

37:20.238 --> 37:22.706
- Is everything all right?

37:22.708 --> 37:26.309
- Yeah.
Fine.

37:26.311 --> 37:28.445
It was martin's mom.

37:28.447 --> 37:30.981
She didn't have a clue
he was here.

37:30.983 --> 37:33.450
She didn't even ask
to speak to him.

37:33.452 --> 37:35.318
She was barely even worried.

37:35.320 --> 37:37.921
- She called, alison.

37:37.923 --> 37:39.589
- Her son slept here
last night,

37:39.591 --> 37:41.925
And she's only
just noticed he's gone?

37:41.927 --> 37:45.662
- She has four children.

37:45.664 --> 37:48.398
- Yeah, well, so what?

37:48.400 --> 37:51.334
- So she might have a bit
on her mind.

37:51.336 --> 37:53.003
- No, she doesn't.

37:53.005 --> 37:55.405
She's rich.

37:59.644 --> 38:01.978
[horse neighs]

38:12.490 --> 38:15.825
[both speaking indistinctly]

38:18.029 --> 38:19.496
- All right, then.

38:19.498 --> 38:20.764
Got it?
- Yeah.

38:28.673 --> 38:30.974
- You're riding a horse.
- [chuckles]

38:33.911 --> 38:36.513
- You look good up there.

39:14.885 --> 39:16.720
- Oh, my god.

39:16.722 --> 39:19.622
[chuckles]

39:19.624 --> 39:21.624
What are you doing?

39:24.462 --> 39:27.464
- I followed you
this morning.

39:27.466 --> 39:28.965
- What?

39:28.967 --> 39:32.102
- After you left
the hotel.

39:32.104 --> 39:33.103
- Why?

39:33.105 --> 39:35.505
- You left so quickly,

39:35.507 --> 39:38.708
I thought you might be hiding
something from me.

39:38.710 --> 39:41.511
It turns out I was right.

39:41.513 --> 39:43.046
What was in that cooler?

39:47.118 --> 39:48.485
You want to tell me

39:48.487 --> 39:50.754
What the fuck you think
you were doing?

39:50.756 --> 39:54.057
- No.
- No?

39:54.059 --> 39:55.492
I trusted you.

39:55.494 --> 39:56.926
- Sorry.
- You should be fucking sorry.

39:56.928 --> 39:58.728
- Don't yell at me.

39:58.730 --> 40:00.597
- You deal fucking coke?

40:00.599 --> 40:04.467
Do you know how stupid that is?
- Yes.

40:04.469 --> 40:06.469
- Do you know what happens
to you if you get caught?

40:06.471 --> 40:07.670
- Yes.

40:07.672 --> 40:10.140
- Then what the hell
are you doing?

40:10.142 --> 40:13.009
- [scoffs]
you wouldn't understand.

40:13.011 --> 40:16.012
- Try to explain it to me.
- Well, I can't.

40:16.014 --> 40:18.014
- Try to explain to me
how knowing what can happen--

40:18.016 --> 40:19.783
- I don't fucking care
what happens to me.

40:19.785 --> 40:21.751
Don't you get it?

40:21.753 --> 40:25.088
I don't fucking care if I live
or die or go to jail or space.

40:25.090 --> 40:27.123
I don't give a sh--

40:34.165 --> 40:36.199
- You are going to jail
eventually.

40:36.201 --> 40:39.169
You must know that.

40:39.171 --> 40:41.805
- We don't have a choice.

40:41.807 --> 40:43.173
The ranch
doesn't sustain itself.

40:43.175 --> 40:44.974
- So sell it!
- We can't.

40:44.976 --> 40:47.844
- Of course you can.
- No.

40:50.181 --> 40:53.817
- Do you think me being here
with you is by accident?

40:53.819 --> 40:55.585
This is a choice.

40:55.587 --> 40:58.455
This is a choice.

41:09.133 --> 41:11.000
You should have told me.

41:11.002 --> 41:13.169
- Sorry.

41:15.539 --> 41:19.008
- Why didn't you?

41:19.010 --> 41:22.011
- I just didn't think
it mattered.

41:26.250 --> 41:28.952
- My son is there
every fucking day.

41:28.954 --> 41:32.088
Are they doing coke around him?
- No, of course not.

41:32.090 --> 41:34.224
We don't do it ourselves.
We don't bring it to the ranch.

41:34.226 --> 41:35.959
We don't sell to kids, ever.

41:35.961 --> 41:37.494
We have rules.

41:37.496 --> 41:39.229
- Oh, how principled of you.

41:47.571 --> 41:49.606
- Well, if you want to go,
just--just go.

41:49.608 --> 41:51.908
- Yeah, I will.

41:53.844 --> 41:56.045
First, there's something else
I've got to tell you.

42:03.254 --> 42:05.855
[horse neighs]

42:05.857 --> 42:07.924
- Cole?

42:09.293 --> 42:10.693
Cole.

42:12.863 --> 42:14.664
- Give me a minute.

42:25.276 --> 42:26.943
- You saw oscar
call the police?

42:26.945 --> 42:28.912
You actually saw him?
- Yes, I told you, yes.

42:28.914 --> 42:30.747
- Because I didn't see you
when I came by.

42:30.749 --> 42:32.815
- I was in the back.
- Hey, scotty, you got the keys?

42:32.817 --> 42:35.084
- Yep.
- All right, let's wrap it up.

42:35.086 --> 42:37.053
- Cole, we need to dump this
shit, throw it in the ocean.

42:37.055 --> 42:38.655
- Why don't you go back
to the ranch?

42:38.657 --> 42:40.223
Find someplace on the edge
of the property--

42:40.225 --> 42:41.958
Someplace discreet.
Make sure nobody's watching.

42:41.960 --> 42:43.293
Dig a hole.
I'll bring the chest.

42:43.295 --> 42:44.928
You take hal.
- I'm telling you, man--

42:44.930 --> 42:46.796
If you bury this shit,
someone's gonna find it.

42:46.798 --> 42:48.298
- Hal, please.
Shut the fuck up, okay?

42:48.300 --> 42:50.099
- Look, I'll drive you.
- No, I'll go by myself.

42:50.101 --> 42:51.935
If I'm gonna get caught
with half a key of coke,

42:51.937 --> 42:53.303
I'd rather be alone.

42:53.305 --> 42:55.038
You stay here with caleb.
It's safer.

42:55.040 --> 42:56.940
When the cops show,
just act like you're working

42:56.942 --> 42:59.042
At a taxi dispatch.

43:01.312 --> 43:02.845
- [sighs]

43:10.988 --> 43:13.590
[knock at door]

43:20.230 --> 43:22.799
[knock at door]

43:29.873 --> 43:32.709
[knock at door]

43:32.711 --> 43:34.811
- Hey, there.

43:37.348 --> 43:39.816
- [chuckles]

43:39.818 --> 43:42.018
[door closes]
- [snorting, spits]

43:42.020 --> 43:43.686
- Oh, you dropped
something.

43:43.688 --> 43:46.956
- What are you doing here?
- You fucking narc.

43:46.958 --> 43:48.091
- Narc.

43:48.093 --> 43:50.093
My man,
I'm an average j-o-e

43:50.095 --> 43:52.729
Looking to score
some d-r-u-gs.

43:52.731 --> 43:54.297
- You called the cops.

43:54.299 --> 43:56.866
- Uh, don't know
what you're talking about.

43:56.868 --> 43:59.736
- You have exactly
six seconds to leave,

43:59.738 --> 44:01.971
Or I'm gonna tear
your fucking head off!

44:01.973 --> 44:03.373
- Caleb!
Caleb!

44:03.375 --> 44:05.375
- Caleb, take it easy!
- Fuck this motherfucker!

44:05.377 --> 44:07.744
- No, someone's been spreading
some rumors about me, man.

44:07.746 --> 44:09.178
I didn't call anyone!
- Fuck you, dude!

44:09.180 --> 44:11.714
She heard you!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

44:11.716 --> 44:14.384
Really?
Really?

44:14.386 --> 44:16.252
- What, you didn't call--
- fascinating, no.

44:16.254 --> 44:18.855
- Get the fuck off her.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay.

44:18.857 --> 44:20.990
I might have given the
impression on calling the cops.

44:20.992 --> 44:22.425
Sometimes I like to pick up
the phone,

44:22.427 --> 44:24.260
Practice what I would say
to them if you ever--

44:24.262 --> 44:26.729
- Who the fuck do you think
you're fucking with?

44:26.731 --> 44:28.765
- It hasn't happened yet!
Hasn't happened yet, huh?

44:28.767 --> 44:29.932
- Look, go to cole.

44:29.934 --> 44:31.401
Tell him
it was all bullshit, okay?

44:31.403 --> 44:33.069
- What? Huh?
- You heard what he's saying.

44:33.071 --> 44:34.270
He's making
the whole thing up.

44:34.272 --> 44:35.905
- He's lying!

44:35.907 --> 44:37.774
- Yeah, what would I have
to gain from that, huh?

44:37.776 --> 44:38.875
You've clearly moved
the stash, right?

44:38.877 --> 44:40.410
- What the fuck
do you know?

44:40.412 --> 44:41.778
- The cops showed up now,
they'd find nothing,

44:41.780 --> 44:43.413
And I'd be
a fucking asshole.

44:43.415 --> 44:45.181
Come on, get out of here.
- Let me deal with this, okay?

44:45.183 --> 44:47.150
Go, go.

44:53.023 --> 44:55.291
- All this time,
I thought you were in mourning.

45:07.304 --> 45:11.107
If you wanted to fuck someone,
bailey, you could've fucked me.

45:14.311 --> 45:18.014
You didn't have to be some
married yuppie's summer slut.

45:19.216 --> 45:21.784
- Get away from--
- ah!

45:21.786 --> 45:23.786
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Come on.

45:23.788 --> 45:26.489
- Get the fuck out of here!
Now!

45:26.491 --> 45:28.891
- All right, all right,
I'm going.

45:32.262 --> 45:34.797
- Sh--

45:34.799 --> 45:37.133
Shit. Fuck!

45:43.207 --> 45:45.341
- Why do you always act
like such a fucking pussy?

45:45.343 --> 45:47.076
- Fuck you.

45:47.078 --> 45:49.345
- I don't like how this
went down much either, cole.

45:49.347 --> 45:51.814
- If all it's gonna take to get
oscar off our ass is the permit

45:51.816 --> 45:53.416
For that fucking bowling alley,
then so be it.

45:53.418 --> 45:55.351
We go down to the town council
tomorrow morning,

45:55.353 --> 45:56.986
We rescind our position,
and it's done.

45:56.988 --> 45:58.888
So far as I'm concerned,
we're back in business.

45:58.890 --> 46:01.224
- Thank god, common sense
finally fucking prevails.

46:01.226 --> 46:03.359
- What's gonna stop this guy
from pulling this shit again?

46:03.361 --> 46:04.894
What if he actually
calls the cops?

46:04.896 --> 46:06.763
- Hal, you need to fucking
lower your voice

46:06.765 --> 46:08.498
And calm the fuck down.

46:08.500 --> 46:12.301
- And you need to get that
finger out of my fucking face.

46:13.504 --> 46:15.905
- Hal?
Hal!

46:17.975 --> 46:21.511
[sighs]

46:21.513 --> 46:24.981
I thought you went home.

46:24.983 --> 46:26.282
- This needs to stop.

46:26.284 --> 46:28.284
- Ali, look,
he was just fucking with you

46:28.286 --> 46:30.286
Because he has
some twisted thing for you,

46:30.288 --> 46:31.888
And you fell for it

46:31.890 --> 46:33.422
Because you're a little
too trusting sometimes,

46:33.424 --> 46:35.258
But we're okay, all right?

46:35.260 --> 46:37.426
We still got eyes and ears
at the precinct--we're fine.

46:37.428 --> 46:39.028
- If it's not oscar,
it's gonna be someone else...

46:39.030 --> 46:40.863
- Ali, please.

46:40.865 --> 46:42.532
- Some banker from the city
who gets busted for possession.

46:42.534 --> 46:43.933
- Cole, we're not done
with this.

46:43.935 --> 46:45.468
- Not now.

46:45.470 --> 46:47.136
- Look, if the police
offer a guy like that a deal,

46:47.138 --> 46:48.404
What stops him
from turning us in?

46:48.406 --> 46:50.406
- What do you want me to do?

46:50.408 --> 46:52.008
We're 100k in the hole
right now.

46:52.010 --> 46:53.309
How am I gonna make
that money

46:53.311 --> 46:55.478
If I don't sell the rest
of that shit?

46:55.480 --> 46:56.813
- Sell the ranch.

46:59.416 --> 47:03.219
- What?
- Sell it.

47:03.221 --> 47:05.555
Let's be honest, cole.

47:05.557 --> 47:08.591
We're miserable here.

47:08.593 --> 47:10.593
- It's not just about us.

47:10.595 --> 47:13.596
Our entire family
depends upon this ranch.

47:13.598 --> 47:15.031
Where are they supposed to go?

47:15.033 --> 47:17.967
- They can go anywhere
they want.

47:17.969 --> 47:20.570
Think about it.

47:20.572 --> 47:22.438
We could start new lives.

47:22.440 --> 47:24.907
We could...

47:24.909 --> 47:27.276
We could finally move on.

47:29.379 --> 47:32.114
- We could move on
from what?

47:34.451 --> 47:36.385
Say it.
I want to hear you say it.

47:36.387 --> 47:39.455
We could move on
from what?

47:39.457 --> 47:42.058
- Cole, please don't.

47:42.060 --> 47:44.460
- There is no moving on.

47:44.462 --> 47:45.628
- Cole.

47:45.630 --> 47:47.330
- Not now.
- Cole!

47:47.332 --> 47:50.266
- What?

47:50.268 --> 47:53.336
Hey, buddy,
what are you still doing here?

47:53.338 --> 47:54.604
- Tell him.

47:54.606 --> 47:58.241
- The mare's gone.

47:58.243 --> 47:59.942
- What?

47:59.944 --> 48:02.111
- I opened up the stable.

48:02.113 --> 48:05.248
The horse ran away.

48:05.250 --> 48:07.083
- God damn it!
[glass shatters]

48:07.085 --> 48:09.085
You come with me.

48:11.955 --> 48:15.024
- [sighs]

48:25.102 --> 48:26.469
- Martin.

48:29.907 --> 48:32.074
I'll drive you home.

48:54.331 --> 48:57.066
So why'd you do it?

49:02.606 --> 49:06.475
- Do you ever do things and...

49:06.477 --> 49:09.979
You don't know why?

49:16.019 --> 49:18.688
- Yeah, sometimes I...

49:18.690 --> 49:22.124
[sighs] I don't know
why I do anything.

49:36.707 --> 49:38.407
- Thank you.

49:51.054 --> 49:53.022
- Come on, go inside.

50:08.605 --> 50:10.139
- Hi.

50:12.542 --> 50:15.077
Um...

50:15.079 --> 50:17.480
I-I thought
about what you said before,

50:17.482 --> 50:20.549
And...

50:20.551 --> 50:24.086
I'm sorry.

50:24.088 --> 50:27.289
I don't want that life
anymore.

50:30.360 --> 50:33.095
I want to start over...

50:33.097 --> 50:36.098
With you.

50:36.100 --> 50:38.734
- Yeah, I've been thinking
about it, too, and...

50:43.707 --> 50:45.374
After today,

50:45.376 --> 50:48.244
I'd have to be insane
to keep this going.

50:53.050 --> 50:56.185
We're leaving at the end
of next week anyway, so...

50:58.789 --> 51:01.757
Let's just end it now.

51:04.261 --> 51:08.130
[door opens]

51:08.132 --> 51:11.067
[door closes]
