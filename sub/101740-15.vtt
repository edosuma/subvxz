the arrest warrant,

06:45.927 --> 06:47.407
and Withers took a hostage.

06:47.450 --> 06:49.365
But the hostage was released
and Withers surrendered.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.062
Until 90 seconds later
when the bomb went boom.

06:51.106 --> 06:52.455

Question is why.

06:52.499 --> 06:54.718
Sure, this guy was
facing prison time.

06:54.762 --> 06:57.025
Yeah, but enough to blow himself
to kingdom come?

06:57.068 --> 06:59.506
Unless it wasn't about him.
When I was working undercover,

06:59.549 --> 07:02.247
I saw this guy
selling bootleg DVDs.

Then he jumped off a
ten-story building.

07:04.424 --> 07:05.729

But then we found heroin

07:07.992 --> 07:09.429
in the DVD cases.

You think our bomber
might be up to something bigger

07:11.082 --> 07:12.519

four miles away.

08:50.051 --> 08:52.880

in 20 minutes, on foot,

08:59.408 --> 09:03.804

methamphetamine in his system?

is still out there.

my childhood best friend.

09:43.626 --> 09:47.151
We lived four houses away
from each other.

09:47.195 --> 09:51.286
So, if you're wondering if this
is personal for me, it is.

09:51.329 --> 09:52.592
But I know

09:52.635 --> 09:55.856
that there is more
to this case.

And I'm pretty sure you do, too.

taking the time.

10:16.050 --> 10:17.442

to Knight yet?

10:23.623 --> 10:25.581
They're not allowing visitors
right now.

10:25.625 --> 10:28.105
They wouldn't let me
see her, either.

10:28.149 --> 10:29.977

10:30.020 --> 10:31.500
Straight out of FLETC.

10:31.543 --> 10:33.981
Promised her the job would
never get boring.

What can you tell us
about Petty Officer Withers?

10:36.113 --> 10:37.419
Real piece of work.

10:37.462 --> 10:39.116
The guy was bragging
to his bunkmates

10:39.160 --> 10:43.077
about stealing weapons for
some backwoods militia group.

10:43.120 --> 10:45.122
Aka white supremacists.Bingo.

10:45.166 --> 10:46.907
They encourage their members
to enlist

10:46.950 --> 10:50.258
in order to gain tactical skills
and experience.

10:50.301 --> 10:51.738
And stealing weapons.

10:51.781 --> 10:54.479
His CO confronted Withers,
he went totally off grid.

10:54.523 --> 10:56.307
Took us three weeks to find him.

10:56.351 --> 10:57.787
How did you find him?Got a tip

10:57.831 --> 11:00.485
on the NCIS hotline
saying he was shacked up

11:00.529 --> 11:02.183
with an old girlfriend.

11:02.226 --> 11:04.315
Does this tip have
a, have a name?

11:04.359 --> 11:05.490

11:05.534 --> 11:07.536
But agents surveilled the house

11:07.579 --> 11:09.538
and verified it was legit.

11:09.581 --> 11:12.628
Was there anything to suggest
that Withers or his group

11:12.672 --> 11:14.717
were maybe into something else?

11:14.761 --> 11:16.501
Yeah, like,
something bigger than guns?

11:16.545 --> 11:19.722
Meaning did we know he was
gonna set off a damn bomb?

11:20.810 --> 11:22.116
Of course
we didn't.

11:22.159 --> 11:24.684
'Cause if we did,
I never would've sent Knight,

11:24.727 --> 11:27.599
or any of my agents,
into that house.

11:32.735 --> 11:34.998
Hey, Kase, I got your text.
Why are we meeting down here?

11:35.042 --> 11:36.347
Bomb parts.

11:36.391 --> 11:37.914
Uh, wouldn't that
be in your lab?

11:37.958 --> 11:39.699
If only wishing made it so.

11:39.742 --> 11:41.831
This is our bomber,
Petty Officer Withers.

11:41.875 --> 11:44.660
And these are the bomb parts
melted to his flesh.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.183
Oof. Uh, okay.

11:46.227 --> 11:49.839
What happened? Was he wearing
the bomb when it went off?

11:49.883 --> 11:51.319
Mm, uh, no.

11:51.362 --> 11:54.409
If that were the case, his body
would be in tiny pieces.

11:54.452 --> 11:56.411
Instead of tiny pieces
being in his body.

11:56.454 --> 11:58.500
See, what happened
was the bomb went off

11:58.543 --> 12:00.023
and sent white-hot
bomb parts flying

12:00.067 --> 12:02.722
across the room and
when they hit his body,

12:02.765 --> 12:05.072
they instantly fused with
his dermis and his spine.

12:05.115 --> 12:06.638
So, how does it help our case?

12:06.682 --> 12:07.901
Well, it can help and hurt.

12:07.944 --> 12:09.250
Upon closer inspection--

12:09.293 --> 12:10.730
mostly done by Jimmy--

12:10.773 --> 12:13.733
I noticed the bomb parts
were made by a 3D printer.

12:13.776 --> 12:14.864
Clever.

12:14.908 --> 12:16.213
Ah, too clever.

12:16.257 --> 12:17.737
We're talking
about 3D printers

12:17.780 --> 12:20.217
on sale at Best Buy for $99.

12:20.261 --> 12:21.741
Anybody can make these parts.

12:21.784 --> 12:23.090
Mm, guessing
that's the "hurt" part.

12:23.133 --> 12:24.918
Yeah. There's no way
to track who made it.

12:24.961 --> 12:26.006
How was it detonated?

12:26.049 --> 12:27.485
That's the part that can help.

12:27.529 --> 12:31.054
This is what's left of a
long-range RFID receiver.

12:31.098 --> 12:34.318
This bomb was detonated
by a cell phone app.

12:34.362 --> 12:36.756
There is an app for everything.

12:40.716 --> 12:41.848
Hello?

12:45.155 --> 12:46.461
Where's Agent Knight?

12:46.504 --> 12:49.769
I don't know.
They said she was here.

12:51.814 --> 12:53.381
[knocks on door]Agent Knight?

12:53.424 --> 12:55.383
KNIGHT:
Need a little private time.
Come back later.

12:55.426 --> 12:57.428
Oh, okay, uh,
we'll just wait in the hall.

12:57.472 --> 12:58.995
Wait.

13:00.301 --> 13:01.650
NCIS?

13:01.693 --> 13:03.913
Uh, yeah, Agents
Bishop and Torres.

13:03.957 --> 13:05.349
Is everything all right?

13:06.350 --> 13:07.525
Thank God.

13:07.569 --> 13:10.398
I thought you
were the nurse.

13:11.442 --> 13:13.618
Have you been
cleared to go home?

13:13.662 --> 13:16.926
Not going home.
I'm going to NCIS.

13:16.970 --> 13:18.623
My team is dead
and I need to know why.

13:18.667 --> 13:19.973
That's actually
why we're here.

13:20.016 --> 13:21.278
We have a few questions
about what happened.

13:21.322 --> 13:22.932
Cool. We can talk in the car.

13:22.976 --> 13:25.369
Kind of in the middle
of a prison break here.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.938
H-- uh...

13:29.939 --> 13:31.288
Nurse Janeway.

13:31.332 --> 13:33.203
This is not what you think.

13:33.247 --> 13:34.291
Mm-hmm.

13:34.335 --> 13:35.292
This time.

13:35.336 --> 13:36.641
JANEWAY:
Get back in bed.

13:36.685 --> 13:38.295
Don't make me say it twice.

13:38.339 --> 13:39.688
[scoffs]

13:39.731 --> 13:41.472
And you two are on my list now.

13:41.516 --> 13:42.647
Great.

13:42.691 --> 13:44.171
[clears throat]

13:45.041 --> 13:46.956
The doctor said
you have five minutes.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.566
That's it.

13:50.351 --> 13:54.311
Well, Agents Bishop, Torres,

13:54.355 --> 13:56.444
looks like
we're talking in here.

13:56.487 --> 13:59.012
We think we know
how the explosive was detonated.

13:59.055 --> 14:00.840
Well, that was quick.

14:00.883 --> 14:03.277
Well, we need your confirmation.
We think Petty Officer Withers

14:03.320 --> 14:04.626
used a cell phone app.

14:04.669 --> 14:06.323
Did you see him
using a phone or...

14:06.367 --> 14:08.891
Wait. You think Toby set it off?

14:08.935 --> 14:10.371
Is that a problem?

14:10.414 --> 14:13.069
[grunts]
For a couple of reasons.

14:13.113 --> 14:15.506
First of all,
Toby hated cell phones.

14:15.550 --> 14:17.117
He kept going on about
how the government

14:17.160 --> 14:18.683
uses them to brainwash people.

14:18.727 --> 14:21.512
And second, he was handcuffed
by three REACT agents

14:21.556 --> 14:22.992
when the bomb detonated.

14:23.036 --> 14:24.037
Are you sure about that?

14:24.907 --> 14:26.126
Look, I know I hit my head

14:26.169 --> 14:28.215
and things are still
a little fuzzy.

14:28.258 --> 14:30.347
But I know what I saw.

14:30.391 --> 14:32.306
Toby didn't set off
a damn thing.

14:32.349 --> 14:36.614
Well, if he didn't detonate
that bomb, who did?

14:36.658 --> 14:37.877
I was hoping you'd tell me.

14:46.146 --> 14:48.365
So, Toby didn't
detonate the bomb?

14:48.409 --> 14:49.932
Not according to Knight.

14:49.976 --> 14:52.804
She said he didn't have a phone
or the opportunity to use one.

14:52.848 --> 14:54.415
I don't understand. Was
someone else in the house?

14:54.458 --> 14:57.418
No, which is why Knight thinks
it was triggered remotely.

14:57.461 --> 14:59.289
So if Toby wasn't the bomber...

14:59.333 --> 15:02.423
He was the target.So we're thinking the
killer called the tip line

15:02.466 --> 15:04.164
to have REACT do the dirty work.

15:04.207 --> 15:07.167
But when they found out
Toby was being taken alive,

15:07.210 --> 15:08.429
they went to plan B.

15:08.472 --> 15:10.561
Remote trigger,
the place goes up.

15:10.605 --> 15:12.563
McGEE:
Whoever wanted Toby dead
wanted it bad.

15:12.607 --> 15:14.957
Lot of work for one guy.

15:15.001 --> 15:16.176
Hey.

15:16.219 --> 15:17.438
Hi.

15:19.222 --> 15:20.223
How's it going?

15:20.267 --> 15:21.833
Mm...

15:22.573 --> 15:24.184
Give me the rundown.

15:25.837 --> 15:29.580
Oh, I got cleared
to leave the hospital.

15:31.278 --> 15:32.888
I swear.

15:35.412 --> 15:37.371
Can I use that desk?

15:37.414 --> 15:39.068
Ooh...
Uh...

15:39.112 --> 15:40.591
Sorry, Agent Knight?

15:40.635 --> 15:42.071
Uh, just call me Jessica.

15:42.115 --> 15:44.117
Or Jess. Or Knight.
Or whatever you want.

15:44.160 --> 15:46.858
Okay, I-I think
there's been a mistake here.

15:46.902 --> 15:48.643
Oof. You ever get that thing
where your sock

15:48.686 --> 15:50.514
is all weird
inside of your shoe?

15:50.558 --> 15:51.951
I got dressedso quick

15:51.994 --> 15:53.648
at the hospital.I just spoke
with the director.

15:53.691 --> 15:55.650
He said that you were
taking time off.

15:55.693 --> 15:56.825
See, that's what
he told me to do.

15:56.868 --> 15:58.348
That's not what I'm doing.

15:58.392 --> 15:59.959
Oh, come on.

16:00.002 --> 16:01.917
If any one of you
lost any one of you,

16:01.961 --> 16:04.050
would you just go home
and cry on your couch?

16:06.443 --> 16:07.488
I'm actually pretty good
at this.

16:07.531 --> 16:09.446
And you have a spare desk here.

16:09.490 --> 16:11.448
Oh, yeah,
so this is not a spare.

16:11.492 --> 16:13.711
This is, um...

16:16.149 --> 16:17.454
It's complicated.

16:17.498 --> 16:19.021
McGEE:
Yeah, we appreciate
the offer,

16:19.065 --> 16:22.503
but we really need to talk
to Director Vance first.

16:26.159 --> 16:27.029
BISHOP:
Uh,

16:27.073 --> 16:29.249
that bat, that's not for people.

16:29.292 --> 16:30.380
Uh, mm-mm.

16:30.424 --> 16:31.991
It's complicated.

16:35.472 --> 16:36.865
Okay.

16:39.302 --> 16:40.956
Give me 72 hours.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.698
If I don't help you
produce results,

16:43.741 --> 16:45.482
I'll go cry on my couch.

16:46.570 --> 16:49.051
Tell you what, I'll give you
24 hours, but that's it.

16:49.095 --> 16:53.360
72 hours, the use of this desk
and all your resources.

16:53.403 --> 16:54.665
McGEE:
24 hours,

16:54.709 --> 16:56.580
resources, no desk.

16:56.624 --> 16:58.539
48, resources, desk.

16:58.582 --> 17:00.454
48, resources, no desk.

17:00.497 --> 17:02.717
Done.

17:02.760 --> 17:04.284
[phone rings]

17:04.327 --> 17:05.807
Be right down, Kase.

17:05.850 --> 17:07.069
I will go with you,

17:07.113 --> 17:09.289
being how I have nowhere
to sit.

17:09.332 --> 17:11.073
Uh, hey, the bat?

17:11.117 --> 17:13.641
Oh.

17:13.684 --> 17:17.471
Oh. Oh, that's Gibbs's desk

17:17.514 --> 17:19.386
Mm.

17:19.429 --> 17:20.604
I'm so sorry.

17:20.648 --> 17:22.737
It's all good.

17:25.435 --> 17:29.091
50 bucks says she wasn't
cleared to leave the hospital.

17:30.005 --> 17:32.703
Hey, Kase.
You know Agent Knight here.

17:32.747 --> 17:36.881
Jess. Oh, thank God you're okay.

17:36.925 --> 17:39.754
And I am so sorry for your loss.

17:39.797 --> 17:40.885
Thanks, Kase.

17:40.929 --> 17:42.278
Knight is going to be joining us

17:42.322 --> 17:43.714
on our investigation.

17:43.758 --> 17:44.889
Of course she is.
What else would she do?

17:44.933 --> 17:46.804
Go home and cry on her couch?

17:46.848 --> 17:48.763
Yeah, uh, what-what
do we got here?

17:48.806 --> 17:50.808
Well, I'm trying to
figure out the cell app

17:50.852 --> 17:52.810
that set off the bomb.

17:52.854 --> 17:54.769
Using the REACT gear?

17:54.812 --> 17:57.337
Yep. REACT is part
of a pilot program.

17:57.380 --> 17:59.643
They're testing a
line of body armor.

17:59.687 --> 18:01.515
Using LED lights,

18:01.558 --> 18:03.560
an X-2R solar charger,

18:03.604 --> 18:05.214
CO2 detectors. Nice.

18:05.258 --> 18:06.911
And a built-in receiver
that detects

18:06.955 --> 18:08.565
nearby radio frequencies.

18:08.609 --> 18:10.089
McGEE:Any chance it can tell
us what cellular signals

18:10.132 --> 18:12.134
were in the room
when the bomb went off?

18:12.178 --> 18:14.702
It could,
if the data wasn't encoded

18:14.745 --> 18:16.747
in a propriety software

18:16.791 --> 18:18.793
only accessible
by the manufacturer.

18:18.836 --> 18:20.229
Kessler Gear Systems?

18:20.273 --> 18:21.970
Talk to them, get the tech
manual for the device,

18:22.013 --> 18:23.754
maybe that'll get us somewhere.

18:23.798 --> 18:26.017
Nice. Thanks, Kase.

18:26.061 --> 18:27.845
Knight, you coming?

18:27.889 --> 18:29.282
I only have 48 hours.

18:29.325 --> 18:31.153
Reading manuals
isn't my thing.

18:56.396 --> 18:58.528
Making new friends, huh?

18:58.572 --> 19:00.182
Old one.

19:00.226 --> 19:02.750
MPD, retired.Hmm.

19:02.793 --> 19:04.752
He brought you a present?

19:06.754 --> 19:08.190
So did you.

19:08.234 --> 19:11.759
Well, I thought you might
be missing it.

19:11.802 --> 19:13.891
The bat, that is.

19:17.286 --> 19:19.070
What?

19:19.114 --> 19:20.942
[chuckles]

19:20.985 --> 19:23.771
You tell me, Bishop.

19:23.814 --> 19:26.208
You called for a meet.

19:26.252 --> 19:27.731
What's on your mind?

19:27.775 --> 19:30.473
[exhales]
Um...

19:30.517 --> 19:31.996
you heard about the REACT team.

19:32.040 --> 19:33.868
Mm-hmm.So what do you think?

19:33.911 --> 19:36.218
I'm trying not to.You know, Agent Knight,

19:36.262 --> 19:38.525
she, uh, she lost everyone,
her whole team.

19:38.568 --> 19:39.700
Just like that, gone.

19:39.743 --> 19:42.093
Makes you think,

19:42.137 --> 19:43.791
was it worth it?

19:44.748 --> 19:46.272
Think you'd have to ask her.

19:47.621 --> 19:50.363
No, Gibbs, I'm...

19:50.406 --> 19:52.408
I'm asking you.

19:52.452 --> 19:55.063
Was it worth it?

19:55.846 --> 19:58.719
Doing what you did,

19:58.762 --> 20:01.330
getting suspended, was...

20:01.374 --> 20:03.376
was it worth it?

20:06.379 --> 20:10.296
Some things, Bishop,
they have a cost.

20:12.994 --> 20:15.910
You still got to get it done.

20:15.953 --> 20:21.307
Was it worth losing... us?

20:24.962 --> 20:26.877
I don't know.

20:30.316 --> 20:32.056
I don't know.

20:38.193 --> 20:40.500
I got to tell you, Mr. Kessler,
when your company

20:40.543 --> 20:42.980
offered to send someone over
to decode the smart armor,

20:43.024 --> 20:45.244
I was expecting one of
your techies, not the CEO.

20:45.287 --> 20:48.421
[chuckles] I'm still a techie
at heart, Agent McGee.

20:48.464 --> 20:53.469
I started Kessler Gear Systems
on a workbench in my basement.

20:53.513 --> 20:54.949
It's my baby.

20:54.992 --> 20:57.821
Plus, I owe NCIS a lot.

20:57.865 --> 20:59.345
Because of the pilot program?Thanks to feedback

20:59.388 --> 21:01.782
from REACT, we're about to close
a government contract

21:01.825 --> 21:04.175
on a whole new line of armor.

21:04.219 --> 21:05.264
Congrats.

21:05.307 --> 21:07.091
And you're welcome.[both chuckle]

21:07.135 --> 21:09.137
He, don't worry.
Part of the deal is making sure

21:09.180 --> 21:11.444
that, from here on out,
we provide NCIS

21:11.487 --> 21:14.577
with as much gear
and tech support as they need.

21:14.621 --> 21:15.883
Nice.

21:17.058 --> 21:20.191
It looks like
the data packet is intact.

21:23.064 --> 21:25.196
Yep. Our body armor
only picked up one RFID signal

21:25.240 --> 21:27.198
at the time of the explosion.

21:27.242 --> 21:30.071
Oh. Really?
One, that's it?

21:31.377 --> 21:32.987
What else do you need?

21:33.030 --> 21:35.337
Well, it's not like you can
tell me the device ID

21:35.381 --> 21:37.034
of the phone
that sent the signal.

21:37.078 --> 21:39.123
Want to bet?Wait, seriously?

21:41.387 --> 21:42.910
Well, this is fantastic.
Now we can now ping the phone

21:42.953 --> 21:44.390
to get the location.

21:46.435 --> 21:47.697
That's it?

21:47.741 --> 21:49.482
According to McGee's ping,

21:49.525 --> 21:52.876
the phone that set off
the bomb is inside that RV.

21:54.530 --> 21:56.619
I'm only getting heat
signatures from a microwave

21:56.663 --> 21:58.055
and mini-fridge.

21:58.099 --> 21:59.666
No explosive devices.

21:59.709 --> 22:01.668
What about people?

22:01.711 --> 22:04.758
Only one. Asleep on the couch.

22:04.801 --> 22:06.847
Yeah, well, backup
should be here soon.

22:09.632 --> 22:12.243
It's funny.

22:12.287 --> 22:13.767
Huh?

22:13.810 --> 22:16.465
Well, I just thought
that two trained agents

22:16.509 --> 22:20.208
against one sleeping RV owner
were pretty good odds.

22:22.297 --> 22:23.690
They are.

22:23.733 --> 22:26.257
So.... let's move in.

22:26.301 --> 22:28.303
See? That's why we
should never be partners.

22:28.347 --> 22:30.566
Why not?Because you can't have
two attack dogs.

22:30.610 --> 22:33.003
Someone's got to hold the leash.

22:36.006 --> 22:38.574
But we do have the
element of surprise.
Mm-hmm.

22:38.618 --> 22:41.925
And if we wait, I mean,
he could wake up and run.

22:41.969 --> 22:44.841
Or worse.Or worse.

22:48.802 --> 22:51.108
Oh, she's a bad influence.
[chuckles]

22:51.152 --> 22:53.807
All right, you take the
back, I'll take the front.

22:58.681 --> 23:00.944
Park ranger!

23:05.209 --> 23:07.429
We need you need
to move your vehicle!

23:11.651 --> 23:14.610
Back was all clear.What about the guy on the couch?

23:14.654 --> 23:16.917
He wasn't sleeping.

23:20.964 --> 23:22.270
Saw him through the window.

23:22.313 --> 23:23.837
Same window I crawled through.

23:24.881 --> 23:27.449
His body was still warm enough
to give us a thermal reading.

23:27.493 --> 23:28.972
Can't be dead long.

23:29.016 --> 23:31.018
Yeah, whoever did it
was in a hurry.

23:38.329 --> 23:40.680
Hey, did you know this dead guy?

23:40.723 --> 23:42.464
His face doesn't ring a bell.

23:42.508 --> 23:44.161
Why?

23:44.205 --> 23:46.207
TORRES:
Because he knew you.

23:47.991 --> 23:50.167
This guy wasn't trying
to blow Toby up.

23:50.211 --> 23:51.212
No.

23:51.255 --> 23:53.257
He was after your whole team.

24:02.092 --> 24:04.181
Petty Officer Withers'
murder was a head-fake.

24:04.225 --> 24:05.835
He was never the target.

24:05.879 --> 24:08.229
Somebody planted a bomb, then
called in an anonymous tip.

24:08.272 --> 24:10.187
You know
what happened next.

24:10.231 --> 24:12.494
My team was the real
target all along.

24:12.538 --> 24:14.453
Who did the aiming?We know who planted the bomb.

24:14.496 --> 24:16.455
Richie Soren,
ex-felon.

24:16.498 --> 24:18.413
Convicted for everything
from check forging

24:18.457 --> 24:20.415
to armed robbery. Lovely guy.

24:20.459 --> 24:22.504
We found a closet
full of bomb-making materials.

24:22.548 --> 24:24.071
Also a wire transfer
for 20 grand.

24:24.114 --> 24:25.464
Do the math.

24:25.507 --> 24:28.379
He was a gun-for-hire.KNIGHT: Hired, then fired.

24:28.423 --> 24:30.730
We're thinking the mad bomber's
boss was cleaning up loose ends.

24:30.773 --> 24:32.732
Any idea who that boss might be?

24:32.775 --> 24:34.298
Kasie is, uh, back-tracing
the transfer now.

24:34.342 --> 24:35.735
But it's gonna take some time.

24:35.778 --> 24:37.258
I've been racking my brain
trying to figure out

24:37.301 --> 24:39.347
who REACT pissed off enough
to want us dead.

24:39.390 --> 24:41.392
And?

24:41.436 --> 24:43.569
[exhales]
Long list.

24:43.612 --> 24:45.484
Agent Knight, I'm gonna
recommend protective custody.

24:45.527 --> 24:48.225
If the killer's goal was
to take out the REACT agents--

24:48.269 --> 24:49.618
I'm not going into hiding.

24:50.706 --> 24:52.186
Agent Knight...

24:52.229 --> 24:54.101
Let's not do this.

24:56.277 --> 24:58.801
I can take care of myself.

24:58.845 --> 25:01.848
And I need to know
what happened to my team.

25:09.246 --> 25:11.205
Or...

25:11.248 --> 25:14.208
we can argue about it
for the next ten minutes?

25:16.993 --> 25:18.560
Okay.

25:18.604 --> 25:20.344
Just watch your back.

25:24.218 --> 25:26.350
MARCIE:
I appreciate you coming
to my side of town.

25:26.394 --> 25:29.353
I rent this space from
the furniture store downstairs.

25:29.397 --> 25:31.965
But the best part is
there is the greatest

25:32.008 --> 25:34.533
little café next door,
and it's fantast--

25:34.576 --> 25:35.708
Oh! Oh, no, no, no.

25:35.751 --> 25:37.187
No. Shoes off.

25:37.231 --> 25:38.406
What?

25:38.449 --> 25:40.756
Shoes off! I'm serious.

25:41.975 --> 25:43.324
I'm...

25:43.367 --> 25:45.021
Oh, God.

25:45.065 --> 25:47.981
This board is where,
where I keep all

25:48.024 --> 25:50.244
of my information
on Hannah's murder.

25:50.287 --> 25:52.681
I wasn't expecting
to hear from you so soon

25:52.725 --> 25:55.292
after our conversation
in the basement.

25:55.336 --> 25:56.859
On the phone
you said

25:56.903 --> 25:58.992
you found something new?

26:01.081 --> 26:03.910
Red duct tape? What does
this have to do with...

26:03.953 --> 26:06.608
It was on her mouth,
her wrists and her ankles.

26:07.653 --> 26:09.350
She-she was bound?

26:12.701 --> 26:14.616
She was hog-tied.

26:14.660 --> 26:16.270
[gasps]

26:16.313 --> 26:18.925
Sorry.

26:20.361 --> 26:21.928
Where did you get this?

26:21.971 --> 26:24.060
I mean, I-I haven't seen this.

26:24.104 --> 26:26.889
The police.It wasn't in their files.

26:28.499 --> 26:30.719
They kept it out.

26:30.763 --> 26:33.287
Probably to throw
off the press and...

26:33.330 --> 26:35.942
eliminate copycats.

26:35.985 --> 26:38.553
Um, was this, um...

26:38.597 --> 26:40.947
hog-tying done before...

26:40.990 --> 26:43.427
Beaten to death
with a hammer?
Oh.

26:43.471 --> 26:45.125
And her body was dumped?

26:46.517 --> 26:48.737
Yeah.

26:49.520 --> 26:50.565
You okay?

26:50.609 --> 26:52.349
[exhales]

26:57.703 --> 26:59.922
Wait a minute.

26:59.966 --> 27:02.055
I've seen this before.

27:02.098 --> 27:04.144
But not about Hannah.

27:04.187 --> 27:06.320
I did an article

27:06.363 --> 27:07.887
quite a while ago

27:07.930 --> 27:09.715
on the rising crime

27:09.758 --> 27:11.325
in the suburbs.
I remember

27:11.368 --> 27:13.370
this red duct tape thing
from another case.

27:16.635 --> 27:18.288
Make yourself useful.

27:27.863 --> 27:29.865
Ah, here it is!

27:29.909 --> 27:32.694
Here it is. I knew
I was right about this tape.

27:33.477 --> 27:36.176
Brian Stafford.
Found dead seven months ago

27:36.219 --> 27:38.744
in a small town
in upstate New York.

27:38.787 --> 27:40.833
Bound with red duct tape

27:40.876 --> 27:43.444
and bludgeoned to death.

27:43.487 --> 27:45.228
With a hammer?
Yep.

27:46.752 --> 27:49.015
Huh.

27:51.800 --> 27:53.976
Would you maybe like a napkin?

27:55.543 --> 27:57.371
Uh...

27:57.414 --> 27:59.242
No.

27:59.286 --> 28:01.331
I'm good.

28:09.078 --> 28:12.908
So... we have
my friend, Hannah,

28:12.952 --> 28:14.867
in Virginia.

28:14.910 --> 28:16.956
Brian Stafford from New York.

28:16.999 --> 28:18.958
Both bound in red tape.

28:19.001 --> 28:21.787
And both bludgeoned
to death with a hammer.

28:21.830 --> 28:23.919
I don't think
this is a coincidence.

28:23.963 --> 28:25.312
No such thing.

28:25.355 --> 28:27.662
What, did you find
something else?

28:27.706 --> 28:29.446
Someoneelse.

28:29.490 --> 28:30.709
Laura Blankenship found

28:30.752 --> 28:32.275
dead in the Outer Banks.

28:32.319 --> 28:34.756
But this doesn't say
anything about red tape.

28:34.800 --> 28:36.366
Yeah, but look
at the wound pattern.

28:36.410 --> 28:37.411
That's a hammer.

28:37.454 --> 28:39.848
Yeah, would you
look at that?

28:39.892 --> 28:42.764
So now there are three.

28:42.808 --> 28:46.550
Unless I'm mistaken, this is
starting to look like a...

28:46.594 --> 28:49.771
Serial killer.Yeah.

28:57.823 --> 28:59.041
I'm sorry.

28:59.085 --> 29:00.782
I didn't realize.
I-I can come back later.

29:00.826 --> 29:02.044
No...

29:02.088 --> 29:03.959
I've had my fill.

29:05.395 --> 29:07.484
[sighs]

29:09.878 --> 29:12.011
Back in the box.

29:13.534 --> 29:15.797
I don't mean to pry.

29:15.841 --> 29:17.799
But, uh...

29:17.843 --> 29:19.758
"the box"?

29:19.801 --> 29:22.151
You know what I do, Jimmy.

29:22.195 --> 29:25.285
I do, yeah. I can't imagine
how difficult it must be.

29:25.328 --> 29:28.636
Having so many lives depend
on what you say next.

29:28.679 --> 29:30.507
Which is why you need
to find a way to manage it.

29:31.682 --> 29:33.293
How do you?

29:34.773 --> 29:37.993
I've walked into hell more times
than you can count.

29:39.255 --> 29:42.302
A bomber about
to blow up a preschool.

29:43.303 --> 29:46.306
A father threatening to slit
his own kid's throat.

29:46.349 --> 29:48.308
And it is my job

29:48.351 --> 29:51.746
to imagine a happy ending
and then to make it happen.

29:51.790 --> 29:54.488
And the only way that you
can do that is to take

29:54.531 --> 29:56.577
every fear...

29:56.620 --> 29:58.144
every pain and just...

29:58.187 --> 29:59.841
Just put it in the box.

29:59.885 --> 30:01.190
And then
when it's over,

30:01.234 --> 30:03.802
only then can you risk...

30:03.845 --> 30:05.760
feeling anything.

30:05.804 --> 30:08.763
I mean, that doesn't sound...

30:08.807 --> 30:10.678
healthy at all.

30:10.721 --> 30:12.027
[both laugh]

30:12.071 --> 30:13.594
Sorry, it-it doesn't.

30:13.637 --> 30:14.943
Never said it was healthy.

30:14.987 --> 30:17.380
Just... just necessary.

30:20.079 --> 30:21.863
And to be honest, I think that's

30:21.907 --> 30:24.039
why I'm still alive
and they're not.

30:24.083 --> 30:26.215
What happened in that house?

30:29.044 --> 30:31.525
I-I might not have

30:31.568 --> 30:34.658
a-a knife or...

30:34.702 --> 30:38.053
a bomb, but...

30:38.097 --> 30:40.926
you can talk to me.

30:45.931 --> 30:48.498
I left them.

30:50.457 --> 30:53.634
When Petty Officer
Withers surrendered

30:53.677 --> 30:56.028
and my team came in
to make the arrest,

30:56.071 --> 30:58.073
I needed to get out
of that room fast.

30:58.117 --> 31:01.511
You had to take a breath, right?

31:02.643 --> 31:04.558
And now...

31:04.601 --> 31:07.430
are you thinking
you should've died with them?

31:10.956 --> 31:12.914
[inhales]

31:12.958 --> 31:15.177
I left my team.

31:18.354 --> 31:21.140
I know a thing or two
about survivor's guilt.

31:21.183 --> 31:22.706
[low sobbing]

31:22.750 --> 31:23.925
[sniffles]

31:23.969 --> 31:27.494
And the question
that I've learned to ask?

31:27.537 --> 31:29.931
How would he feel

31:29.975 --> 31:32.151
about you surviving?

31:34.980 --> 31:37.983
Wherever Agent Madden
is right now,

31:38.026 --> 31:39.898
I think he'd be thrilled.

31:39.941 --> 31:42.117
[chuckles softly]

31:43.031 --> 31:44.424
[sniffles]

31:44.467 --> 31:46.948
He, of all people, knew
how short life could be.

31:48.341 --> 31:50.604
Why "of all people"?

31:51.953 --> 31:53.824
His advanced lung disease.

31:54.869 --> 31:57.176
Are you telling me
Eddie was sick?
Yes.

31:57.219 --> 31:58.873
Based on his current condition,

31:58.917 --> 32:01.093
he had less than a year to live.

32:03.747 --> 32:05.401
He never said anything.

32:05.445 --> 32:07.577
It would appear that you're not

32:07.621 --> 32:10.276
the only one who's good
at compartmentalizing.

32:12.974 --> 32:15.107
McGEE:
Think I got a lead.

32:15.150 --> 32:17.457
Just came from
Agent Madden's house,

32:17.500 --> 32:18.980
found something pretty
interesting in his garage.

32:19.024 --> 32:20.286
Look at this.

32:20.329 --> 32:22.723
BISHOP: Uh, that's
REACT's smart armor.

32:22.766 --> 32:23.724
That's not very interesting.

32:23.767 --> 32:24.986
How about now?

32:25.030 --> 32:26.814
A ton of it,
stashed at his house.

32:26.857 --> 32:28.816
Okay, so what do you think
he was doing with all that gear?

32:28.859 --> 32:30.339
Worth a ton of money.

32:30.383 --> 32:31.950
You think he was doing
some kind of side business?

32:31.993 --> 32:35.214
Like maybe selling, uh,
stolen equipment on the DL?

32:36.171 --> 32:37.781
No way Eddie was dirty.

32:38.869 --> 32:40.132
It's just a theory.

32:40.175 --> 32:42.308
Well, your theory's wrong.

32:43.352 --> 32:44.353
McGEE:
Equipment's supposed to stay

32:44.397 --> 32:45.833
in the NCIS armory.

32:45.876 --> 32:48.227
And Eddie had authorization
to take it out.

32:48.270 --> 32:50.316
He was the gear manager.

32:52.057 --> 32:55.190
I understand...

32:57.366 --> 33:00.152
Eddie was a good cop.

33:00.195 --> 33:01.501
I'd bet my life on it.

33:01.544 --> 33:04.591
In fact, I have, more than once.

33:06.506 --> 33:08.160
KASIE:
After you told me about

33:08.203 --> 33:10.466
all that missing gear,
I took the liberty

33:10.510 --> 33:13.165
of tracking Agent Madden's
movements in our building,

33:13.208 --> 33:15.994
to see if anything
flagged my weirdometer.

33:16.037 --> 33:18.344
And it got flagged.

33:18.387 --> 33:21.129
According to the system logs,
uh, Agent Madden swiped

33:21.173 --> 33:26.961
his REACT key card at the NCIS
training facility four days ago.

33:27.005 --> 33:28.136
So? He is a gym rat.

33:28.180 --> 33:30.008
11:00 p.m. at night?Night owl.

33:30.051 --> 33:33.272
Take a look at the security
footage from the gym

33:33.315 --> 33:35.143
at 11:00 p.m.

33:36.623 --> 33:37.711
He ain't there.

33:37.754 --> 33:40.061
Even though
his key card said he was.

33:40.105 --> 33:41.323
That's weird.[Knight sighs]

33:41.367 --> 33:42.846
Try mildly irregular.

33:42.890 --> 33:44.718
Those card readers
glitch all the time.

33:44.761 --> 33:46.067
Yeah, you're right.

33:46.111 --> 33:48.548
They glitch.
They're glitchers.

33:48.591 --> 33:52.726
So to be sure,
I checked the actual data logs

33:52.769 --> 33:55.076
to get secondary confirmation
of the swipe,

33:55.120 --> 33:57.209
and according to the data logs,

33:57.252 --> 33:59.733
Madden was someplace
else entirely

33:59.776 --> 34:02.083
when he swiped his card.

34:02.127 --> 34:04.129
Where was he?

34:04.172 --> 34:06.479
At the armory.

34:09.134 --> 34:11.136
McGEE:Walking out with a
quarter-million dollars'

34:11.179 --> 34:12.485
worth of equipment.

34:12.528 --> 34:15.618
Which he then tried to
cover up afterwards.

34:16.619 --> 34:18.186
Not a good look.

34:28.762 --> 34:30.633
She took that well.

34:38.511 --> 34:41.253
TORRES:
So if Madden was stealing
gear from NCIS,

34:41.296 --> 34:43.255
how did he end up dead?

34:43.298 --> 34:44.604
Maybe he had a falling out
with a buyer.

34:44.647 --> 34:46.214
Or a partner.

34:48.695 --> 34:51.393
Sorry about the lab.
Won't happen again.

34:52.525 --> 34:56.355
If Madden was dirty,
Madden was dirty.

34:57.791 --> 34:59.967
I'm sorry, what did I miss?I killed a stapler.

35:00.010 --> 35:01.621
Oh, you know,
I've been there.

35:01.664 --> 35:03.536
So what makes you think
that he had a partner?

35:03.579 --> 35:05.320
KNIGHT:
He'd been taking calls
on the job.

35:05.364 --> 35:06.974
Personal calls,
in the middle of the day.

35:07.017 --> 35:09.542
At first I didn't think
anything about it, but now...

35:09.585 --> 35:11.370
Maybe they were calls were to
a partner about the stolen gear?

35:11.413 --> 35:13.154
And maybe that partner
got tired of going halfsies

35:13.198 --> 35:14.373
and took Madden out.

35:14.416 --> 35:15.809
We got to find
this partner.

35:15.852 --> 35:17.289
BISHOP:
Yeah, which is why
I've been pulling up

35:17.332 --> 35:19.595
GPS history from Madden's car.

35:19.639 --> 35:22.468
So this is
from last week.

35:22.511 --> 35:24.339
Damn. He's been all
over the place.

35:24.383 --> 35:27.168
BISHOP:Yeah, Madden stopped
at three law offices

35:27.212 --> 35:29.823
and two chemical laboratories.

35:29.866 --> 35:32.434
It's not the kind of people who
usually buy stolen body armor.

35:32.478 --> 35:34.132
So what was he doing?

35:34.175 --> 35:36.960
He was trying to figure out
why the armor was killing him.

35:39.528 --> 35:41.313
Madden had
advanced lung disease.

35:41.356 --> 35:43.967
Turns out it was
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

35:44.011 --> 35:45.317
Is that unusual?

35:45.360 --> 35:46.970
Not if you're over 65
and you're a heavy smoker,

35:47.014 --> 35:48.842
or if you happen to work
around toxic fumes.

35:48.885 --> 35:52.324
I dove into his medical history.
Madden was a health nut.

35:52.367 --> 35:54.195
His only issue was a minor

35:54.239 --> 35:55.718
asthma condition
which he managed just fine

35:55.762 --> 35:58.199
up until about a year ago,
when it got way worse.

35:58.243 --> 36:00.288
Now, that coincides with...

36:00.332 --> 36:02.334
The gear pilot program,

36:02.377 --> 36:04.858
which started
exactly a year ago.

36:04.901 --> 36:07.513
So you're saying
the armor made him sick?

36:07.556 --> 36:09.079
I had Kasie run an analysis
on the materials.

36:09.123 --> 36:14.520
Turns out the outer materials
had high levels of PBDE.

36:17.392 --> 36:19.133
Pretend like
I'm not as smart as you.

36:19.177 --> 36:21.440
Sorry, right, uh, it-it's
used in flame retardants,

36:21.483 --> 36:23.746
or at least it was,
until 2004 when it was banned

36:23.790 --> 36:26.836
because the off-gassing
was found to be so highly toxic.

36:26.880 --> 36:29.491
But I wore the armor, too.
My entire team did.

36:29.535 --> 36:31.363
So how come Madden was
the only one who got sick?

36:31.406 --> 36:34.148
For you and for others,
it would take years

36:34.192 --> 36:36.019
of exposure to get sick.

36:36.063 --> 36:37.238
But for someone
like Madden,

36:37.282 --> 36:39.371
with a preexisting
asthma condition?

36:39.414 --> 36:43.853
Putting this armor on
was like a ticking time bomb.

36:43.897 --> 36:47.292
So Madden wasn't stealing
those boxes to sell them,

36:47.335 --> 36:48.902
he was gathering evidence.

36:48.945 --> 36:51.644
Which explains why he was
visiting labs and law offices.

36:51.687 --> 36:53.211
He was building a case.

36:53.254 --> 36:54.516
Against who?

36:54.560 --> 36:56.562
Mr. Kessler, we appreciate you
coming in again,

36:56.605 --> 36:59.086
We just have a, uh, few more
questions about your gear.

36:59.129 --> 37:02.089
Of course.
Like I said, anything you need.

37:02.132 --> 37:03.612
What do you want to know?

37:03.656 --> 37:06.485
Well, how long have you known
that it could make you sick?

37:11.707 --> 37:13.231
Wait a minute, I'm confused.

37:13.274 --> 37:14.362
Really?

37:14.406 --> 37:16.059
Seems pretty clear to me.

37:16.103 --> 37:17.931
Your company
manufactured body armor

37:17.974 --> 37:20.238
that contained
an illegal toxic chemical.

37:20.281 --> 37:21.587
TORRES:
Cheaper to make.

37:21.630 --> 37:23.110
But if it kills people,
so what, right?

37:23.153 --> 37:24.590
McGEE:Agent Madden found
out about it.

37:24.633 --> 37:26.113
And when he threatened
to expose you

37:26.156 --> 37:28.071
on the heels of your
big government contract...

37:28.115 --> 37:29.116
You killed him.

37:29.159 --> 37:30.596
Oh, I'm sorry,
no, you,

37:30.639 --> 37:32.902
you hired someone to kill him.

37:32.946 --> 37:34.687
And so that no one ever found
out about the tainted gear,

37:34.730 --> 37:37.429
you fixed the problem
in your new product line.

37:37.472 --> 37:38.778
No more icky stuff.

37:38.821 --> 37:41.650
[laughs] Is this supposed
to intimidate me?

37:41.694 --> 37:43.391
'Cause if you want
to see intimidation,

37:43.435 --> 37:45.524
wait until my lawyers get here.Well, we'd like
to meet them.

37:45.567 --> 37:46.829
We'll show them this.

37:46.873 --> 37:48.091
Am I supposed to know

37:48.135 --> 37:49.441
what that is?Well, you should.

37:49.484 --> 37:50.790
It's the wire transfer you paid

37:50.833 --> 37:52.444
to Richie Soren
to blow up the house.

37:52.487 --> 37:54.141
You remember him?
Ex-con,

37:54.184 --> 37:55.577
lived in an RV?

37:55.621 --> 37:56.926
It took us a little while,
but we traced the payment

37:56.970 --> 37:59.886
back to an offshore account
owned by you.

37:59.929 --> 38:03.150
See, you're not the only one
with cool gadgets.

38:05.021 --> 38:07.285
Okay, yes,

38:07.328 --> 38:09.983
Madden was going to expose me
and ruin everything,

38:10.026 --> 38:13.552
but hiring the bomber
wasn't my idea.

38:13.595 --> 38:15.684
Then whose idea was it?

38:22.212 --> 38:23.344
Kessler?

38:23.388 --> 38:25.346
He gave you up.

38:25.390 --> 38:26.869
Told us everything.

38:26.913 --> 38:29.655
Well, I suppose
if it had to end,

38:29.698 --> 38:32.179
better it be with...
with you.

38:32.222 --> 38:34.921
Tell me, when Madden first
came to you with his concerns

38:34.964 --> 38:37.358
about the gear,
did you even contemplate

38:37.402 --> 38:39.491
going to the higher-ups
and doing the right thing?

38:39.534 --> 38:41.971
Or did you just go straight
to Kessler and cut a deal?

38:42.015 --> 38:45.497
Keep Madden silent in exchange
for a nice, hefty paycheck.

38:45.540 --> 38:47.499
No, Jess...The anonymous tip

38:47.542 --> 38:49.109
that sent us to that house.

38:49.152 --> 38:50.415
That was you,
wasn't it?

38:50.458 --> 38:52.939
You sent us there to kill us.

38:52.982 --> 38:54.549
The bomb was only meant
for Madden.

38:54.593 --> 38:56.203
[exhales]
It-it was supposed

38:56.246 --> 38:58.031
to go off when he was
in the house alone

38:58.074 --> 38:59.380
going through final sweeps.

38:59.424 --> 39:01.382
It w-- it was Soren.

39:01.426 --> 39:03.341
Soren jumped the gun.

39:03.384 --> 39:05.081
I never intended

39:05.125 --> 39:07.867
to hurt you, ever,
or the others.

39:07.910 --> 39:10.043
And that makes it okay?I figured,

39:10.086 --> 39:13.525
since Madden was dying anyway...

39:13.568 --> 39:15.875
Tom, he was family.

39:15.918 --> 39:19.052
They all were. Are you seriously
trying to justify this?

39:19.095 --> 39:20.836
No.

39:25.014 --> 39:26.973
[exhales]
I'm just talking.

39:27.930 --> 39:29.323
[scoffs]

39:32.892 --> 39:35.111
Well, the time for that is over.

39:40.116 --> 39:41.248
Yeah.

39:41.291 --> 39:43.293
Let's go.

39:43.337 --> 39:44.904
Come on.

39:44.947 --> 39:48.603
I suppose you're right, Jess.

39:49.865 --> 39:50.910
What are you doing, Tom?

39:50.953 --> 39:52.564
I'm saving you from filling out

39:52.607 --> 39:54.566
a lot of paperwork.

39:54.609 --> 39:57.960
I remember how much
you always hated that.

39:59.484 --> 40:01.355
[traffic passing below]

40:01.399 --> 40:03.618
[ragged inhale]

40:06.578 --> 40:09.276
Aren't you gonna
try and stop me?

40:09.319 --> 40:13.802
Use your tricks
to talk me out of it?

40:15.630 --> 40:17.893
No.

40:19.329 --> 40:21.114
[scoffs]

40:21.157 --> 40:23.333
I've already
played my trick.

40:24.726 --> 40:25.945
What?

40:25.988 --> 40:28.600
Why do you think I'm
on this side of you?

40:28.643 --> 40:30.340
I wanted the sun at your back
so you wouldn't see

40:30.384 --> 40:32.821
the agent I have
coming up on your right.

40:36.738 --> 40:38.827
[exhales]

40:41.177 --> 40:43.223
[bell tolling]

40:47.270 --> 40:51.536
VANCE:
And just as Agents Madden,
Ono and Vargas

40:51.579 --> 40:56.018
have given their lives
in service to our country,

40:56.062 --> 40:58.673
they also serve as a reminder

40:58.717 --> 41:01.459
that wherever this life
takes us,

41:01.502 --> 41:04.287
whether here or beyond,

41:04.331 --> 41:08.944
we will forever be
brothers and sisters,

41:08.988 --> 41:13.383
bound by the duty and honor

41:13.427 --> 41:15.342
to which we are sworn.

41:24.177 --> 41:25.744
McGEE:
Agent Knight.

41:25.787 --> 41:28.790
McGee, I told you,
call me Jessica.

41:28.834 --> 41:31.010
Or Jess. Or Knight or...

41:31.053 --> 41:32.968
McGEE: Hey, um, listen,
I just wanted to,

41:33.012 --> 41:34.927
I wanted to say thank you
for your help on the case.

41:34.970 --> 41:37.016
KNIGHT: Oh, no,
I should be thanking you.

41:37.059 --> 41:41.455
And hey, we did it
in under 48 hours.

41:41.499 --> 41:43.762
Well, technically, it
was 49 and a half...

41:43.805 --> 41:45.590
Ugh.
but who's counting?

41:45.633 --> 41:48.375
You, apparently.[chuckles]

41:48.418 --> 41:50.551
[sighs] Well,

41:50.595 --> 41:52.814
maybe I'm losing my touch.

41:52.858 --> 41:54.903
May be a good time
to take a step back.

41:54.947 --> 41:57.166
You? Slow down?

41:57.210 --> 42:00.518
[laughs softly]
More like decompress.

42:00.561 --> 42:02.389
Besides, going back
to the office now,

42:02.432 --> 42:03.564
I'd feel like Annie.

42:03.608 --> 42:05.610
Or Harry Potter.

42:05.653 --> 42:07.089
How do you mean?

42:07.873 --> 42:09.744
An orphan.

42:14.270 --> 42:16.316
My family's gone.

42:18.927 --> 42:21.539
I'm not sure
where I belong right now.

42:24.716 --> 42:26.805
Well, Jess...

42:27.806 --> 42:30.069
...that's the thing
about families.

42:30.852 --> 42:32.985
Sometimes they grow.
