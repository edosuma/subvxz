It's supposed to be a surprise.

04:57.013 --> 04:58.514
Dude, Ton.

04:58.598 --> 05:00.891
You have been with Crystal
for six years.

05:00.975 --> 05:01.434
Yes.

05:01.517 --> 05:02.727
Yes.

05:02.810 --> 05:05.646
And in those six years,
how many times have I told you

05:05.730 --> 05:08.149
She does not like surprises.

05:08.232 --> 05:10.026
Exactly.

05:10.109 --> 05:11.193
You know, he's right, man.

05:12.612 --> 05:15.990
Kids like surprises. Not adults.

05:16.073 --> 05:18.409
Dude, what if she says, "No"?

05:18.492 --> 05:20.119
Uh, it could happen.

05:20.202 --> 05:23.372
And then if she says, "No,"
you're gonna be stuck,

05:23.456 --> 05:25.333
trapped in Tahiti.

05:25.416 --> 05:27.084
But it's Tahiti.

05:27.168 --> 05:28.419
It's paradise.

MASTER CHIEF:
Ain't that the truth?

05:35.301 --> 05:37.136
Just ask any of my ex-wives.

05:37.219 --> 05:38.721
[chuckles]

05:38.804 --> 05:41.599
TOC right now, gentlemen.
We have an immediate problem.

05:41.682 --> 05:46.228
(♪♪♪)

05:46.312 --> 05:48.272
MASTER CHIEF:
CDC contracted a lab

05:48.356 --> 05:51.609
in this little one-horse town
for vaccine development.

05:51.692 --> 05:54.070
Four weeks ago,
it was declared a D-Zone.

05:54.153 --> 05:55.946
Your mission
is to infil that lab

05:56.030 --> 05:58.491
and secure
that prototype vaccine.

05:58.574 --> 06:00.868
And then haul-ass
onto the extraction point.

06:00.951 --> 06:03.329
So, we suit up, grab and go. Where's the problem?

06:03.412 --> 06:04.413
MASTER CHIEF:
Well, the problem is

06:04.497 --> 06:07.124
that intel informs us
that some of the infected

06:07.208 --> 06:08.584
are surviving the blast.

06:09.710 --> 06:11.462
Yeah, that's right.

06:11.545 --> 06:12.463
MASTER CHIEF:
Apparently,

06:12.546 --> 06:15.800
these sons of bitches
are silent, faster,

06:15.883 --> 06:17.259
and more aggressive
than any runners

06:17.343 --> 06:19.553
that you've exterminated
in the past.

06:19.637 --> 06:21.430
So, this, uh...

06:21.514 --> 06:23.224
prototype vaccine
must be some kind

06:23.307 --> 06:25.101
of Messiah shot.

06:25.184 --> 06:27.311
Why aren't the brass
sending in a full battalion?

06:27.395 --> 06:28.688
To redirect
several hundred troops

06:28.771 --> 06:31.315
to extract an unproven vaccine
from a D-Zone

06:31.399 --> 06:34.402
that's swarming with infected
sup'ed-up assholes?

06:34.485 --> 06:35.945
No.

06:36.028 --> 06:38.489
That'd be more like genocide
than a game plan.

06:38.572 --> 06:42.034
What I need, a few canaries

06:42.118 --> 06:46.539
to slip in, sniff around,
and sneak out undetected.

06:46.622 --> 06:47.873
Canaries?

06:47.957 --> 06:49.917
No.
Maybe that was a bad example.

06:51.127 --> 06:52.253
What do you think?

06:53.671 --> 06:56.549
Yep, you'll HALO in
via this baby.

06:56.632 --> 06:58.426
Now, don't get excited.

06:58.509 --> 07:00.845
I know it's not the prettiest horse in the barn.

07:00.928 --> 07:01.887
Little long in the tooth,

07:01.971 --> 07:03.723
but it's got all the luck
where it's needed.

07:03.806 --> 07:07.143
Plus, it's the best I could do
on such short notice.

07:07.226 --> 07:08.602
Kinda like you guys.

07:09.729 --> 07:12.565
This mission far exceeds
any threat assessment

07:12.648 --> 07:14.567
of any mission
you've been on already.

07:14.650 --> 07:16.986
You're gonna be jumpin'
straight into hell.

07:17.069 --> 07:19.280
If you're lookin'
for a glory day, this is it.

07:21.532 --> 07:23.409
A lot of good lives
will be saved.

07:23.492 --> 07:24.702
You wanna be part
of the solution,

07:24.785 --> 07:27.496
you get your frog-man on,
you suit up, and you follow me.

07:33.043 --> 07:35.463
You each have to call it
for yourselves on this one.

07:35.546 --> 07:39.550
(♪♪♪)

07:41.927 --> 07:43.471
Man, fuck Tahiti.

07:43.554 --> 07:44.764
No surprises.

07:47.391 --> 07:49.560
MASTER CHIEF:
Most of this equipment,
you gentlemen are familiar with.

07:49.643 --> 07:51.520
You've used it in a previous tour of deployments.

07:51.604 --> 07:53.189
But if you look around,
you'll notice,

07:53.272 --> 07:55.733
I got you a few new extra toys.

07:55.816 --> 07:57.318
Pack a little extra punch

07:57.401 --> 07:59.278
in case you find yourselves
in a hot spot.

07:59.361 --> 08:01.781
TON:
Thermo, really?

08:01.864 --> 08:03.574
But I thought
they already nuked the town.

08:03.657 --> 08:04.700
Speakin' of which,

08:04.784 --> 08:06.202
how are we supposed
to breathe in that poison?

08:06.285 --> 08:07.286
AJAX:
With this.

08:08.954 --> 08:09.914
MASTER CHIEF:
The filters and batteries

08:09.997 --> 08:12.458
have been modified
from the SEAL rebreathers.

08:12.541 --> 08:15.920
By the way, the more you move,
the better they work.

08:16.003 --> 08:19.298
And if it gives you any trouble,
I'll be right there to fix it.

08:20.299 --> 08:23.302
Unless you desert me again.

08:27.681 --> 08:28.682
Deserter?

08:30.851 --> 08:32.937
Now, that's a new low
even for you.

08:33.020 --> 08:35.105
It is what it is...

08:35.189 --> 08:36.148
Boss.

08:36.232 --> 08:37.650
If memory serves,

08:37.733 --> 08:42.071
I had an easy choice,
stay with your sorry ass

08:42.154 --> 08:43.572
or go home
with the most beautiful woman

08:43.656 --> 08:45.491
I've ever been with in my life.

08:46.575 --> 08:47.576
All right.

08:48.577 --> 08:49.537
You win.

08:49.620 --> 08:50.746
I always win.

08:53.457 --> 08:54.750
Fellas,

08:54.834 --> 08:58.921
allow me to introduce
you to Chief Petty Officer Ajax.

08:59.004 --> 09:00.589
My BUDs classmate,
drinking buddy,

09:00.673 --> 09:03.134
and before he transferred
to an R&D desk job,

09:03.217 --> 09:06.053
was nearly my brother-in-law.

09:06.136 --> 09:07.680
Your sister broke my heart,
you know?

09:07.763 --> 09:08.722
Is she seein' anyone right now?

09:08.806 --> 09:10.057
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't get your ass kicked--

09:10.140 --> 09:10.933
Boss!

09:11.016 --> 09:12.101
That's enough. Knock it off.

09:12.184 --> 09:14.311
Ajax,
get him in his battle rattle.

09:15.521 --> 09:16.772
AJAX:
Helmets are new.

09:16.856 --> 09:19.191
-You'll be the first ones
to use 'em.
-Lucky us.

09:19.275 --> 09:20.943
So, you're tellin' me
this thin-ass fabric

09:21.026 --> 09:22.486
is gonna keep me from roastin'?

09:22.570 --> 09:23.612
That's the idea.

09:24.697 --> 09:26.282
MASTER CHIEF:
Now, this particular configuration

09:26.365 --> 09:27.533
is hot off the factory floor.

09:27.616 --> 09:29.869
So, unfortunately, well,
we haven't had a lot of time

09:29.952 --> 09:31.912
to test it
considering the situation.

09:31.996 --> 09:34.373
But it has been modified
for Dead Zone ops.

09:34.456 --> 09:36.375
Fully-suppressed firearms.

09:37.334 --> 09:38.794
Every effort to keep us concealed

09:38.878 --> 09:40.588
and your life has been made.

09:40.671 --> 09:41.797
MASTER CHIEF:
Lock and load, gentlemen.

09:41.881 --> 09:43.007
Masks on.

09:48.304 --> 09:49.138
Whoa!

09:49.221 --> 09:50.598
Gunnery Sergeant Sinclair.

09:50.681 --> 09:52.099
Sergeant first-class Ton.

09:52.182 --> 09:53.976
P.O.S.C Danner, check.

09:54.059 --> 09:54.977
Good coms.

09:55.060 --> 09:56.854
On your visors,
you got a basic HUD.

09:56.937 --> 09:58.480
On your ears,
you got an AMP system

09:58.564 --> 10:00.691
for suit-to-suit comms
and increased audibility.

10:00.774 --> 10:03.235
Soft sounds become loud,
loud becomes soft.

10:03.319 --> 10:05.613
Now, each helmet is completely soundproofed to the Zone.

10:05.696 --> 10:06.864
You could blow
your vocal cords,

10:06.947 --> 10:08.365
and we're the only ones
that'll hear it.

10:08.449 --> 10:09.533
That's comforting.

10:09.617 --> 10:12.620
And one more trick
up your sleeve is a last resort.

10:12.703 --> 10:14.955
500,000 lumens,
2K throw.

10:15.039 --> 10:16.916
Powerful enough
to permanently blind,

10:16.999 --> 10:19.543
hot enough to start a fire
at close range.

10:19.627 --> 10:20.711
Ten-second burst.

10:22.546 --> 10:25.049
I will emphasize, "last resort."

10:25.132 --> 10:27.009
What about a close-quarters
encounter?

10:27.092 --> 10:30.179
We still don't know how all this holds up in actual combat.

10:30.262 --> 10:31.889
Oh, you want a test run?

10:31.972 --> 10:33.223
Don't you?

10:33.307 --> 10:35.809
You've had this coming
for a long time.

All right.
That's enough fun for now.

11:28.862 --> 11:30.114
What do you say, Boss?

11:31.240 --> 11:33.242
I think we can use
all the help we can get.

11:34.243 --> 11:43.252

11:52.261 --> 12:01.270

12:08.777 --> 12:11.822
Danner and Master Chief
will be on three comms windows.

12:11.905 --> 12:14.408
On touchdown, pass Sitting Bull.

12:14.491 --> 12:18.454
When I verify and secure
the vaccines, pass Geronimo.

12:18.537 --> 12:22.249
Once we reach the EZ,
our final pass is Crazy Horse.

12:22.332 --> 12:23.959
Chief will send a taxi.

12:24.043 --> 12:26.462
And radiation
is a rough way to go.

12:26.545 --> 12:29.006
So, make sure you stay
covered up at all times.

12:29.089 --> 12:30.549
Got 90 seconds,
and that's it.

12:30.632 --> 12:31.717
That's all we got, huh?

12:31.800 --> 12:33.635
They said it's like drowning...

12:33.719 --> 12:34.970
in fire.

12:35.054 --> 12:35.971
You really haven't taken

12:36.055 --> 12:38.432
one of these
into a D-Zone before?

12:38.515 --> 12:41.101
But if they don't work,
the good news is

12:41.185 --> 12:43.312
you'll be dead
before you hit the ground.

12:48.317 --> 12:49.985
DANNER:
Well, it's a shame really.

12:50.986 --> 12:52.613
We straight up poison the world.

12:52.696 --> 12:54.907
That's why we gotta get
these shots.

12:54.990 --> 12:58.368
Until then,
we gotta keep droppin' bombs.

12:58.452 --> 13:00.829
Damned if we do,
damned if we don't.

13:00.913 --> 13:02.873
Kinda like us canaries.

13:07.086 --> 13:08.295
30 seconds to drop.

Do you copy? Over.

14:19.032 --> 14:23.537
Ironside Main, Ironside Main,
this is Archangel Actual.

14:23.620 --> 14:25.998
Pass Sitting Bull. Over.

14:31.086 --> 14:32.296
MASTER CHIEF:
Roger, Actual.

14:32.379 --> 14:35.716
This is Master Chief on Main.
Sitting Bull confirmed.

14:35.799 --> 14:39.386
Check in at your next waypoint.
Have a safe walk. Over.

14:40.512 --> 14:42.514
DANNER:

14:45.350 --> 14:47.394
Radiation's already messing
with the signal.

14:47.478 --> 14:48.562
AI is adjusting.

14:48.645 --> 14:50.147
You've set it.
Now, you can forget it.

14:50.230 --> 14:52.149

Sounds too good to be true.

14:54.610 --> 14:55.861

14:57.446 --> 15:01.283
SINCLAIR:
Yes, sir. We've got two clicks
at about one-eight-zero.

15:45.994 --> 15:47.663

Still fresh.

15:47.746 --> 15:49.915
I'd say one day, maybe less.

15:49.998 --> 15:53.585
Looks like they used a two-shot
on a one-time-rig.

15:57.589 --> 16:00.676
The M84s blew the windows
to alert the infected,

16:00.759 --> 16:02.970
