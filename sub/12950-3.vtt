00:01.371 --> 00:03.931
<i>Seven years ago, I was
recruited to work for SD-6,</i>

00:04.040 --> 00:06.475
<i>which I was told
was a covert branch of the CIA.</i>

00:06.476 --> 00:08.277
<i>I was trained as a spy,</i>

00:08.278 --> 00:10.778
<i>warned not to tell anyone
what I did.</i>

00:10.780 --> 00:12.781
<i>I thought I was working
for the good guys,</i>

00:12.782 --> 00:15.751
<i>until I told my fiancé
about SD-6</i>

00:15.818 --> 00:16.952
<i>and they had him killed.</i>

00:16.953 --> 00:18.554
<i>That's when I learned
the truth.</i>

00:18.555 --> 00:21.683
<i>That SD-6 is part of the very
enemy I thought I was fighting.</i>

00:21.758 --> 00:23.325
<i>Now I'm a double agent,</i>

00:23.326 --> 00:26.227
<i>working with the real CIA
to bring down SD-6,</i>

00:26.296 --> 00:28.297
<i>where my only ally
is another double agent,</i>

00:28.298 --> 00:30.065
<i>a man I hardly know.</i>

00:30.066 --> 00:32.566
<i>My father.</i>

00:33.770 --> 00:37.206
During the Cold War,
six fully armed nuclear weapons

00:37.307 --> 00:40.538
were smuggled into and buried
within the United States.

00:40.644 --> 00:42.545
When SD-6 picked up our nuke,

00:42.546 --> 00:44.747
they put it on a plane
bound for Egypt.

00:44.748 --> 00:46.649
They sold the thing
to Ineni Hassan.

00:46.650 --> 00:48.450
You're going to Cairo.
Devlin told me.

00:48.451 --> 00:50.286
Yeah. I need your help.

00:50.287 --> 00:52.881
SD-6 can't know
that's where I'm going.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:02.599 --> 01:05.099
I'm holding the core.

01:16.046 --> 01:18.380
I'm holding
enough plutonium here

01:18.381 --> 01:21.316
to liquefy our insides
in 48 hours.

01:21.384 --> 01:23.786
Put it down.

01:23.787 --> 01:25.221
I put it down, you'll kill me.

01:25.222 --> 01:26.755
Now.

01:26.756 --> 01:29.256
I'm going to count to one.

01:30.327 --> 01:32.827
Okay.

01:47.410 --> 01:49.910
You're falling behind, Sydney.

01:51.581 --> 01:54.081
And I don't accept late papers.

01:54.184 --> 01:56.518
Okay, you know what?
Good point.

01:56.519 --> 01:59.818
You shouldn't, but I do have
a really good excuse.

01:59.889 --> 02:03.882
Okay, I was on a business trip,
and my flight was delayed.

02:05.962 --> 02:08.657
I have the bomb,
and I'm ready for extraction!

02:08.732 --> 02:09.732
E.T.A., two minutes.

02:09.733 --> 02:11.500
I might not have two minutes.

02:11.501 --> 02:13.636
I made it clear in my syllabus

02:13.637 --> 02:16.401
that I was happy to receive
your papers via e-mail

02:16.473 --> 02:18.340
if you can't
get them to me directly.

02:18.341 --> 02:20.142
You do have e-mail, don't you?

02:20.143 --> 02:22.643
Yes. You're not
going to believe this,

02:22.679 --> 02:25.648
but there was a blackout
where I was staying.

02:26.082 --> 02:28.582
Honestly.

02:35.558 --> 02:36.859
Okay, stop.

02:36.860 --> 02:38.894
I can appreciate
the complexities

02:38.895 --> 02:41.796
of pursuing a graduate degree
with a full-time job,

02:41.865 --> 02:44.425
but it seems to me that
your work is taking precedence

02:44.501 --> 02:45.901
over your education.

02:45.902 --> 02:47.870
Now, admit it, Sydney.

02:47.871 --> 02:50.371
You're dropping the ball.

03:05.488 --> 03:08.719
My job is a means to an end.

03:08.792 --> 03:12.284
Your class makes me feel
like maybe someday

03:12.362 --> 03:15.126
I'll be able to do
something more with my life.

03:16.700 --> 03:19.200
The package is secure.

03:20.337 --> 03:22.404
Copy that.

03:22.405 --> 03:25.169
All right.

03:25.275 --> 03:26.742
Next paper's due Thursday.

03:26.743 --> 03:28.410
I assume
that won't be a problem.

03:28.411 --> 03:31.278
No, not at all.
Okay, thank you so much.

03:38.621 --> 03:41.121
Are you sure about that?

03:44.527 --> 03:47.027
How's Friday?

04:15.625 --> 04:17.593
What's confusing is that Charlie

04:17.594 --> 04:19.795
has this amazing offer
from Fleming Letterman.

04:19.796 --> 04:22.526
It's the most prestigious
law firm in L.A.

04:22.599 --> 04:23.866
But Charlie's not excited?

04:23.867 --> 04:25.000
He's just kind of weird.

04:25.001 --> 04:26.435
He never wants to talk about it.

04:26.436 --> 04:29.234
He doesn't brag.
Wouldn't you brag?

04:29.305 --> 04:31.540
I would be nonstop
talking about myself

04:31.541 --> 04:33.308
if a firm like that wanted me.

04:33.309 --> 04:36.005
You are coming from
very different places.

04:36.112 --> 04:39.548
In his whole family,
he's first-generation college.

04:39.616 --> 04:40.883
That's true.

04:40.884 --> 04:43.384
Not to mention law school.
He's probably nervous.

04:43.453 --> 04:45.854
He's probably terrified.

04:45.855 --> 04:47.322
That's what my dad said.

04:47.323 --> 04:48.991
I called him last night
to ask him what he thought.

04:48.992 --> 04:50.492
He said, "Missy, give it a rest.

04:50.493 --> 04:51.994
You're making something
out of nothing.

04:51.995 --> 04:53.796
Charlie is
one of the good ones."

04:53.797 --> 04:55.030
Your dad's right.

04:55.031 --> 04:56.632
It's just weird
having that feeling

04:56.633 --> 04:59.431
that someone you love
isn't telling you everything.

05:01.304 --> 05:03.804
I can't believe you can
call your dad for advice.

05:03.807 --> 05:05.974
I just can't imagine.

05:05.975 --> 05:08.671
The worst thing is having a dad
who's always right.

05:08.778 --> 05:12.009
No, it's not the worst thing.

05:14.083 --> 05:17.849
I ran into my father last week.

05:17.921 --> 05:19.188
Where?

05:19.189 --> 05:22.090
Just out shopping.

05:22.158 --> 05:24.526
It was so empty.

05:24.527 --> 05:26.161
It wasn't empty.
It was full, actually.

05:26.162 --> 05:28.662
Full of awkwardness
and these lame pauses.

05:28.665 --> 05:31.165
I don't know.

05:31.201 --> 05:33.701
Your dad's just...

05:35.638 --> 05:37.539
He's just your dad.

05:37.540 --> 05:40.475
I don't want it
to be like that anymore.

05:40.543 --> 05:42.978
I'm sick of it.

05:42.979 --> 05:44.480
I always had this feeling

05:44.481 --> 05:51.045
that maybe someday
my dad and I would connect,

05:51.120 --> 05:53.620
that things could start
to get better.

05:54.858 --> 05:57.358
You know my opinion
of your dad.

05:58.194 --> 05:59.661
I know.

05:59.662 --> 06:01.697
If you can find it
in your heart

06:01.698 --> 06:03.232
to forgive him
for being the kind of guy

06:03.233 --> 06:04.967
he's been all your life,

06:04.968 --> 06:07.630
which I would find impossible
and could never do,

06:07.704 --> 06:10.332
then you should make
a real effort.

06:10.406 --> 06:12.508
How do you start
something like that?

06:12.509 --> 06:14.776
I have so many questions.

06:14.777 --> 06:16.278
You can call the man.

06:16.279 --> 06:18.580
I'm not gonna reconnect
with my father over the phone.

06:18.581 --> 06:19.715
Fine, go to his work.

06:19.716 --> 06:23.083
Go to the airplane factory or
whatever and start talking.

06:24.521 --> 06:27.021
You're really good at talking.

06:35.865 --> 06:38.033
Dad.

06:38.034 --> 06:39.902
Sydney,
what are you doing here?

06:39.903 --> 06:42.170
I would have called.
I didn't know if that was...

06:42.171 --> 06:44.006
You shouldn't be here.

06:44.007 --> 06:46.874
I told you I have
a thousand questions.

06:46.943 --> 06:49.111
They're keeping me
awake at night.

06:49.112 --> 06:50.279
Then take something.

06:50.280 --> 06:53.408
Dad, did you know SD-6
was going to recruit me?

06:53.483 --> 06:54.950
Did you help?

06:54.951 --> 06:56.318
This isn't the time.

06:56.319 --> 06:57.853
I need to ask you about Mom.

06:57.854 --> 07:00.222
Was it just an accident

07:00.223 --> 07:03.021
or did you tell her
about what you were doing,

07:03.092 --> 07:04.593
like I told Danny?

07:04.594 --> 07:07.461
Look where you are.
You're exposed.

07:07.530 --> 07:08.931
Dad, please.

07:08.932 --> 07:11.432
Don't come here again.
Not again.

07:18.641 --> 07:21.610
The device that you
withdrew from Taipei last month

07:21.711 --> 07:23.312
remains in analysis.

07:23.313 --> 07:25.447
They're trying to figure out
what it does

07:25.448 --> 07:26.848
and how it does it.

07:26.849 --> 07:30.341
At the time, I told you that
Oskar Muller was the designer.

07:30.420 --> 07:33.685
In truth,
Muller was just an academic,

07:33.756 --> 07:36.520
a scientist who took
another man's sketches,

07:36.593 --> 07:39.391
translated them into
practical construction plans,

07:39.462 --> 07:40.629
and put it all together.

07:40.630 --> 07:41.863
Who designed it?

07:41.864 --> 07:44.166
A man named Milo Rambaldi.

07:44.167 --> 07:45.567
Never heard of him.

07:45.568 --> 07:47.603
That doesn't surprise me.

07:47.604 --> 07:49.838
He died in 1496.

07:49.839 --> 07:53.969
Rambaldi was Pope Alexander VI's
chief architect.

07:54.077 --> 07:55.243
Excommunicated for heresy.

07:55.244 --> 07:58.145
Sentenced to death
for suggesting that someday

07:58.214 --> 08:01.843
science would allow us
to know God.

08:02.919 --> 08:05.547
After Rambaldi's death,
his workshop was torn apart.

08:05.622 --> 08:08.352
His plans and sketches
were traded and sold

08:08.424 --> 08:10.092
for next to nothing.

08:10.093 --> 08:11.526
For the next five centuries,

08:11.527 --> 08:13.862
his work was scattered
throughout the world.

08:13.863 --> 08:17.424
No one is sure what's left,
which is unfortunate

08:17.500 --> 08:19.668
because, last March,
a Russian historian

08:19.669 --> 08:22.399
happened upon one
of Rambaldi's early designs.

08:22.472 --> 08:27.171
She recognized something
that looked a lot like...

08:27.276 --> 08:28.644
a transistor.

08:28.645 --> 08:31.705
I don't understand.
Do you understand?

08:31.814 --> 08:35.306
It seems that Rambaldi
was a prophet.

08:35.385 --> 08:40.448
We acquired one of his notebooks
from San Lazaro.

08:40.523 --> 08:43.023
This is the analysis report.

08:45.495 --> 08:47.496
"Rudimentary schematic

08:47.497 --> 08:49.997
for a transportable
vocal communicator."

08:49.999 --> 08:52.499
The guy was drawing up plans
for a cellphone

08:52.535 --> 08:53.969
around the time
of the Ottoman Empire.

08:53.970 --> 08:56.004
- Come on.
- Ridiculous, right?

08:56.005 --> 08:59.133
You know me.
I am not a New Age kind of guy.

08:59.242 --> 09:01.343
I don't believe in the power
of the pyramid.

09:01.344 --> 09:03.412
I'm not a big granola fan.

09:03.413 --> 09:05.747
This typically
makes me roll my eyes.

09:05.748 --> 09:07.816
Then my eyes came across this.

09:07.817 --> 09:11.014
Written in 1489.

09:11.087 --> 09:13.188
Rambaldi wrote machine code.

09:13.189 --> 09:16.590
Actually, if I could,
it's probably not machine code.

09:16.659 --> 09:19.184
I mean, the concept
of zero's been around...

09:19.262 --> 09:20.896
Well, it precedes Christ.

09:20.897 --> 09:22.931
The numeral one has been
around even longer than that.

09:22.932 --> 09:26.163
Actually, Ptolemy used zeroes
as punctuation marks.

09:26.235 --> 09:28.603
In Indian texts, zero is
more of a spiritual concept

09:28.604 --> 09:29.771
than an actual number.

09:29.772 --> 09:31.339
Of course,
when I say "Indian,"

09:31.340 --> 09:33.041
I don't mean the kind
with the bow and arrows...

09:33.042 --> 09:35.542
Thank you, Marshall.

09:36.212 --> 09:37.612
We don't know what it is.

09:37.613 --> 09:39.548
Rambaldi has become
a priority for us.

09:39.549 --> 09:42.143
We want to learn what it is
before anybody else does.

09:42.218 --> 09:44.119
Have you tried
running the sequence?

09:44.120 --> 09:45.654
It's incomplete.

09:45.655 --> 09:47.322
The entire sequence was written

09:47.323 --> 09:49.491
on the back
of two Rambaldi sketches.

09:49.492 --> 09:51.693
We possess one,
and the other one

09:51.694 --> 09:53.361
is in this man's
private collection.

09:53.362 --> 09:57.389
Eduardo Benegas.
Spanish, V.C., auto enthusiast.

09:57.467 --> 09:59.401
He also owns
the largest collection

09:59.402 --> 10:01.902
of pornographic art in Madrid.

10:02.305 --> 10:06.264
Which I thought was
an interesting fact. Sorry.

10:06.375 --> 10:08.577
We negotiated with him
to buy one of the sketches.

10:08.578 --> 10:10.912
Suddenly he withdrew the piece.

10:10.913 --> 10:13.575
We believe that somebody tipped
him off as to its real value.

10:13.649 --> 10:15.016
We think it's K-Directorate.

10:15.017 --> 10:17.747
Unfortunately,
they're onto Rambaldi, too.

10:17.820 --> 10:21.347
It's possible K-Directorate
stole a key from Benegas.

10:21.424 --> 10:23.725
Our data-reconnaissance
division thinks,

10:23.726 --> 10:25.727
although it hasn't
been confirmed yet,

10:25.728 --> 10:27.362
that he's surrounded
at all times

10:27.363 --> 10:29.197
by half a dozen bodyguards.

10:29.198 --> 10:30.565
We're talking about guys

10:30.566 --> 10:32.901
trained
under the UEl Special Forces.

10:32.902 --> 10:34.603
We also have reason to believe

10:34.604 --> 10:37.801
that Benegas keeps the key
on his person at all times.

10:37.907 --> 10:39.741
So the big question is,

10:39.742 --> 10:42.242
how did K-Directorate
swipe the key?

10:42.311 --> 10:44.811
Anna.

10:45.815 --> 10:48.315
It was Anna, wasn't it?

10:55.491 --> 10:58.085
<i>Eduardo Benegas has a sketch</i>

10:58.161 --> 11:00.661
<i>drawn by Milo Rambaldi.</i>

11:04.100 --> 11:06.600
<i>There's a code
written on the back.</i>

11:09.438 --> 11:11.938
<i>SD-6 wants that code.</i>

11:13.643 --> 11:16.143
<i>The sketch is in a case.</i>

11:17.880 --> 11:20.380
<i>The case is in a vault.</i>

11:20.983 --> 11:22.818
<i>The vault is on the top floor</i>

11:22.819 --> 11:25.515
<i>of a car museum
owned by Benegas.</i>

11:26.756 --> 11:29.452
<i>So I'm going to Madrid.</i>

11:29.525 --> 11:32.025
<i>What's my countermission?</i>

11:33.396 --> 11:37.230
So it's 2,000 words or less
on gene sequencing

11:37.300 --> 11:39.401
in virus-resistant cabbage,
right?

11:39.402 --> 11:41.236
And I'm realizing slowly

11:41.237 --> 11:44.468
that I might not have
a real handle on the situation.

11:44.574 --> 11:46.107
Which part?

11:46.108 --> 11:49.305
Just the part
about the gene sequencing

11:49.412 --> 11:51.379
in the virus-resistant cabbage.

11:51.380 --> 11:53.481
Doesn't your paper have
a science correspondent?

11:53.482 --> 11:55.650
Hello?

11:55.651 --> 11:58.586
Hi.

11:59.789 --> 12:03.054
Okay, uh, yeah.

12:03.125 --> 12:04.292
Hello?

12:04.293 --> 12:06.361
Okay, thanks.
I will come by.

12:06.362 --> 12:07.662
Sorry. Wrong number.

12:07.663 --> 12:08.997
- Thanks so much.
- Bye.

12:08.998 --> 12:10.832
- So you're busy.
- Who was...

12:10.833 --> 12:13.597
You okay? When you were
on the phone, it looked like...

12:13.669 --> 12:14.936
It was Danny's landlord.

12:14.937 --> 12:16.938
They found some of his stuff
in the garage.

12:16.939 --> 12:19.439
- You all right?
- Yeah.

12:19.542 --> 12:22.568
Do you want me to go?
I can get that stuff for you.

12:22.678 --> 12:24.012
Would you mind?

12:24.013 --> 12:26.513
I have to go to San Diego
for the bank tonight.

12:26.515 --> 12:27.749
Don't worry about it.

12:27.750 --> 12:30.250
- It's done.
- Thanks.

12:31.120 --> 12:32.787
So, who called?

12:32.788 --> 12:34.422
Oh, it was a wrong number.

12:34.423 --> 12:36.923
They were looking
for a pizza place.

12:39.228 --> 12:43.562
I think I'm gonna go for
a quick run before my cab comes.

12:48.004 --> 12:49.271
Hey.

12:49.272 --> 12:50.672
Hi.

12:50.673 --> 12:53.506
Devlin wants you to follow
through on Sloane's orders.

12:53.609 --> 12:56.237
Apparently, we're both after
the same piece of missing code.

12:56.345 --> 12:57.712
- You're kidding me.
- Nope.

12:57.713 --> 12:59.381
You already knew about Rambaldi?

12:59.382 --> 13:02.044
I didn't. The agency did.

13:02.118 --> 13:04.452
Da Vinci meets Nostradamus.
I don't buy it.

13:04.453 --> 13:06.655
Tell the CIA station chief
in Barcelona

13:06.656 --> 13:08.189
to prep for a dead drop.

13:08.190 --> 13:09.791
Worst case,
I'll encrypt the code

13:09.792 --> 13:11.927
on a Radiohead MP3
and leave it on Audiogalaxy.

13:11.928 --> 13:14.129
How did Russian underground
find out about Rambaldi?

13:14.130 --> 13:16.630
Hey, you're the intel guy.

13:17.934 --> 13:21.597
What can you tell me
about Anna Espinosa?

13:24.440 --> 13:26.940
She was born in Cuba,
raised in Russia.

13:26.976 --> 13:29.476
One of the last
of the Cold War babies.

13:29.478 --> 13:31.313
Go-to officer at K-Directorate

13:31.314 --> 13:33.942
for wet work
and active measures.

13:34.016 --> 13:35.283
About a year ago,

13:35.284 --> 13:37.218
I had a meeting with
an informant in Yugoslavia.

13:37.219 --> 13:40.382
Low-level. Just a guy with
intel who needed the money.

13:40.456 --> 13:42.324
Anna recorded
the entire conversation

13:42.325 --> 13:44.259
with a parabolic mike
from the building next door.

13:44.260 --> 13:45.694
How do you know?

13:45.695 --> 13:48.096
Because as I was
shaking his hand to leave,

13:48.097 --> 13:50.964
she blew out the back of his
skull with a sniper rifle,

13:51.033 --> 13:52.968
even though she got
what she came for.

13:52.969 --> 13:55.767
Her way of telling me
I was out of my league.

13:57.740 --> 13:59.741
Be careful out there.

13:59.742 --> 14:01.710
See you when I get back.

14:01.711 --> 14:03.278
No, actually, you won't.

14:03.279 --> 14:06.942
I'm being replaced
by a senior officer.

14:07.016 --> 14:10.417
It seems I wasn't experienced
enough to be your handler.

14:15.891 --> 14:18.985
It was really good to meet you.

14:19.061 --> 14:21.561
Good luck in Madrid.

14:24.066 --> 14:26.566
He's an idiot.
That's the problem.

14:26.569 --> 14:27.836
So is Davenport.

14:27.837 --> 14:29.804
They're so involved
in their own bureaucratic...

14:29.805 --> 14:31.039
Protocol.

14:31.040 --> 14:32.240
You know who's replacing me?

14:32.241 --> 14:33.742
- Yes. Lambert.
- Lambert.

14:33.743 --> 14:35.276
Can I say something?

14:35.277 --> 14:39.475
Not just as a fellow officer,
but as a very smart man.

14:39.548 --> 14:41.583
You're getting too emotional
about this.

14:41.584 --> 14:42.684
Not this again.

14:42.685 --> 14:44.386
You're attached to this woman.

14:44.387 --> 14:45.687
This is your answer
for everything.

14:45.688 --> 14:47.489
If you were paying me
to analyze you...

14:47.490 --> 14:49.090
Shut up. Stop it.

14:49.091 --> 14:51.159
I'd say that you're jealous.

14:51.160 --> 14:53.685
The guy may be senior,
but he's junior. Trust me.

14:53.763 --> 14:56.561
Now he gets to see Sydney every
week, and it's making you crazy.

14:56.632 --> 14:58.600
- This is not about me.
- Yes, it is.

14:58.601 --> 15:01.101
No, it's not.

15:10.880 --> 15:12.914
She's going to Madrid.

15:12.915 --> 15:14.616
There's this agent
with K-Directorate.

15:14.617 --> 15:16.584
She could not sound
more dangerous.

15:16.585 --> 15:19.679
I'm scared for Sydney.

15:19.755 --> 15:24.454
I know I'm off the case,
but I want her to come back.

15:28.197 --> 15:30.265
There's nothing
you can do about it.

15:30.266 --> 15:34.066
You don't know if this woman
will be in Madrid.

15:34.136 --> 15:36.636
So why worry?

16:05.201 --> 16:09.137
You sure wrote a hell of a lot
about this Bristow girl.

16:09.205 --> 16:12.140
Anything else
I need to know about her?

16:13.476 --> 16:15.343
I think you'll find
that Sydney's quite capable

16:15.344 --> 16:17.844
of speaking for herself.

16:18.080 --> 16:20.248
Look at her.

16:20.249 --> 16:22.945
Wouldn't kick that out of bed.

16:29.692 --> 16:31.426
Okay. You're going
to Madrid tonight.

16:31.427 --> 16:34.191
The fundraiser's gonna be
at this Vieta auto museum.

16:34.263 --> 16:36.788
You probably want
to dress nice, dress to thrill.

16:36.866 --> 16:40.859
Maybe you'd like to wear
this necklace, huh?

16:40.936 --> 16:42.570
The pearls are fiberglass.

16:42.571 --> 16:45.802
That's better to transmit
the vibrations from your larynx

16:45.908 --> 16:48.408
to the mike
right inside the pendant.

16:49.111 --> 16:52.171
Uh, you... maybe you want
to try it on.

16:52.281 --> 16:54.943
I could sample it.

16:55.017 --> 16:57.517
Probably wouldn't match my...

16:57.520 --> 16:59.721
Señora.

17:01.957 --> 17:04.457
Gracias.

17:05.161 --> 17:06.493
I'm in.

17:06.494 --> 17:08.163
Roger that.

17:08.164 --> 17:10.498
Last year,
Benegas lent some money

17:10.499 --> 17:13.366
to the paramilitary
down in Colombia.

17:13.435 --> 17:15.403
It didn't fly well
with the guerrillas.

17:15.404 --> 17:17.605
Everyone's gonna be
a bit jumpy tonight.

17:17.606 --> 17:19.273
That's okay.
We can use that.

17:19.275 --> 17:23.108
We've got a normal
Spanish peseta, right?

17:23.179 --> 17:25.679
Wrong. Sonic-wave emitter.

17:26.348 --> 17:28.942
Just make sure
you drop it near a window.

17:59.081 --> 18:01.581
Anna just crashed the party.

18:02.218 --> 18:04.718
Careful, Syd.

18:05.287 --> 18:07.288
I don't want to
tell you what to do

18:07.289 --> 18:09.591
when you're out in the field
or anything,

18:09.592 --> 18:11.259
but the unveiling
of the prototype

18:11.260 --> 18:14.525
would be a good time
to activate the coin.

18:14.597 --> 18:15.630
As hot as you look,

18:15.631 --> 18:17.899
they'd be looking at the car
and not at you.

18:17.900 --> 18:20.960
Benegas racing
is proud to present

18:21.036 --> 18:25.803
its new 627-110 prototype!

18:32.414 --> 18:34.249
You take this pen right here.

18:34.250 --> 18:36.618
Normal-looking pen
that you'd write with.

18:36.619 --> 18:40.077
Click that like that and boom.

18:51.934 --> 18:54.235
Now, the vault is
on the top floor.

18:54.236 --> 18:57.364
You're gonna have to bypass
all the security cameras.

18:57.439 --> 18:59.474
I got a remote modem.
Remote modem.

18:59.475 --> 19:02.308
What you do is
you wire it in the, uh,

19:02.378 --> 19:04.878
the central-junction box, which
is located on the first floor.

19:04.913 --> 19:06.481
Then Dixon can loop
the video signal.

19:06.482 --> 19:08.982
Central panel.
Junction box "A."

19:10.753 --> 19:11.753
Damn it.

19:11.754 --> 19:13.788
- What?
- Anna's already been here.

19:13.789 --> 19:15.657
She's tapped in
to the alarm system.

19:15.658 --> 19:16.658
Remote modem?

19:16.659 --> 19:19.159
Yes, which means
she's got backup.

19:19.228 --> 19:21.229
All right, Syd, leave it there.

19:21.230 --> 19:22.764
We'll piggyback
off their signal.

19:22.765 --> 19:25.393
We don't want to trigger
the central alarm.

19:25.467 --> 19:26.801
Do you see Anna
on any of the monitors?

19:26.802 --> 19:28.736
Not on any of the feeds.

19:37.613 --> 19:39.781
She's in the ducts.

19:39.782 --> 19:42.307
I'm heading for the elevators.
Did you rig the cameras?

19:42.384 --> 19:44.884
Looping the feed now.

20:00.869 --> 20:03.369
I'm running
the lock descrambler.

20:33.535 --> 20:36.035
Anna's in the vault.

20:39.475 --> 20:42.000
The vault will be
unlocked in five seconds.

20:43.412 --> 20:45.012
What's wrong
with the descrambler?

20:45.013 --> 20:47.982
They're jamming your frequency.
I'll try and find them.

21:15.010 --> 21:17.510
Dixon, the elevator's
locked down.

21:19.148 --> 21:20.481
The descrambler's still jammed.

21:20.482 --> 21:22.216
Hold on, Sydney.

21:22.217 --> 21:24.252
I see them.

21:31.527 --> 21:33.594
Hurry!

21:33.595 --> 21:36.095
Hurry. They're coming up.

21:42.971 --> 21:45.471
We're back on-line.

22:23.212 --> 22:24.545
I think she's taking
the north corridor.

22:24.546 --> 22:27.046
I'm gonna try to head her off.

22:40.796 --> 22:43.296
I'm headed
towards the chopper now.

23:47.062 --> 23:49.562
Dixon, she's going out back.

23:55.103 --> 23:57.603
Sydney!

23:57.973 --> 24:00.473
Syd, up there!

24:03.478 --> 24:05.212
- Give me your gun.
- Sydney.

24:05.213 --> 24:07.713
Give me the gun!

24:19.428 --> 24:21.729
Hi, I'm Will Tippin.
I'm a friend of Sydney's.

24:21.730 --> 24:23.798
She asked me to come
pick up some of her stuff.

24:23.799 --> 24:26.299
This is all of it.

24:27.836 --> 24:30.336
They arrest anyone yet?

24:30.806 --> 24:33.306
- Uh, for the murder?
- Mm-hmm.

24:33.375 --> 24:35.309
No, not yet.

24:35.310 --> 24:36.644
Do you have any idea

24:36.645 --> 24:38.546
how long that
traffic camera's been there?

24:38.547 --> 24:41.047
No, I don't.

24:46.521 --> 24:49.422
Do the traffic cameras take
a picture at every red light,

24:49.491 --> 24:51.626
or just when there's a car
in the intersection?

24:51.627 --> 24:53.260
Really?

24:53.261 --> 24:55.991
Can we get ahold of every photo
taken on June 8th

24:56.064 --> 24:57.465
between midnight and 6:00 A.M.

24:57.466 --> 24:59.734
At the corner
of Alavis and Sunset?

24:59.735 --> 25:02.260
Okay, great. Call me back.

25:02.337 --> 25:04.505
Fighting a traffic ticket?

25:04.506 --> 25:06.674
I swear to God
the genetics piece

25:06.675 --> 25:08.809
is practically arriving
on your desk as we speak.

25:08.810 --> 25:10.478
- Practically?
- Very nearly practically.

25:10.479 --> 25:12.580
Almost concurrent
with this conversation.

25:12.581 --> 25:16.517
Out of 2,000 words, how many
have you practically typed?

25:16.585 --> 25:17.818
Counting the headline?

25:17.819 --> 25:21.619
Will, don't make me regret
hiring people in their 20s.

25:27.362 --> 25:28.863
Yeah?

25:28.864 --> 25:31.364
Hi, um, I don't know

25:31.433 --> 25:32.933
if I'm talking
to the right person,

25:32.934 --> 25:35.459
but I need to borrow
a million bucks.

25:35.537 --> 25:38.199
The Olsen twins went public,
and I'm looking to invest.

25:38.306 --> 25:41.434
You'll need some collateral.
I don't think you've got any.

25:41.543 --> 25:43.377
Have you seen
my aqua-blue Chevy?

25:43.378 --> 25:44.712
With the hula girl on the dash?

25:44.713 --> 25:46.347
Yes, sadly, we've seen that.

25:46.348 --> 25:47.548
Welcome home.

25:47.549 --> 25:48.849
Thanks.

25:48.850 --> 25:50.518
How was San Diego?

25:50.519 --> 25:52.753
Boring.
How'd the article turn out?

25:52.754 --> 25:53.854
It's boring.

25:53.855 --> 25:55.890
You might be too wiped out,

25:55.891 --> 25:57.725
but some of us are gonna
have dinner tonight.

25:57.726 --> 26:00.094
Love to.
I could use some fun.

26:00.095 --> 26:02.229
You want to do it
at my place? I'll order in.

26:02.230 --> 26:03.831
Great. Um, 7:00?

26:03.832 --> 26:05.866
- How about 7:30?
- Okay.

26:05.867 --> 26:08.631
I better get going before I
get fired, which is inevitable.

26:08.704 --> 26:09.804
Will.

26:09.805 --> 26:11.972
Yeah?

26:11.973 --> 26:13.741
Nothing. It's just...

26:13.742 --> 26:16.242
It's nice to be home.

26:17.879 --> 26:20.379
Yeah, um...

26:20.382 --> 26:22.817
I'll see you tonight.

26:22.818 --> 26:25.318
Okay.

26:30.926 --> 26:33.227
You're gonna like
working with me.

26:33.228 --> 26:35.096
Really?

26:35.097 --> 26:37.431
Must have been, uh...

26:37.432 --> 26:40.196
oh, I almost don't know
how to say it, uh...

26:40.268 --> 26:42.964
devastating
when Kenny was killed,

26:43.038 --> 26:45.473
but I want you to know
you can trust me.

26:45.474 --> 26:48.238
I understand.
I empathize.

26:49.177 --> 26:51.677
His name was Danny.

26:51.780 --> 26:53.080
Danny?

26:53.081 --> 26:54.582
Yes, of course.

26:54.583 --> 26:58.542
Well, what happened to Danny
was a tragedy.

26:58.620 --> 27:02.818
Yet you didn't give up.

27:02.891 --> 27:04.825
Mr. Lambert,
I got your message.

27:04.826 --> 27:06.560
Is there a reason I'm here?

27:06.561 --> 27:10.691
I just wanted
to introduce myself.

27:10.766 --> 27:13.530
Grab a little face time
with my girl.

27:16.004 --> 27:17.338
I wanted to make sure

27:17.339 --> 27:19.839
you don't have any queries
I might be able to...

27:19.875 --> 27:20.941
I've got a query.

27:20.942 --> 27:22.843
Yeah? Shoot.

27:22.844 --> 27:24.178
Are you insane?

27:24.179 --> 27:26.013
Calling me in here
for a social event?

27:26.014 --> 27:28.983
SD-6 has a division whose
sole responsibility it is

27:29.050 --> 27:31.712
to track their agents and
report back suspect activity.

27:31.787 --> 27:35.348
"Your girl" is risking
her life, and you yours,

27:35.423 --> 27:36.891
every time we lay eyes
on each other.

27:36.892 --> 27:39.952
So do me a favor.
Don't be so friendly.

27:42.697 --> 27:46.292
I just love your spirit.

27:47.869 --> 27:49.770
That's heartening.

27:49.771 --> 27:50.771
Are we done here?

27:50.772 --> 27:53.174
Yeah, honey, we're all done.

27:53.175 --> 27:55.675
Okay.

28:02.050 --> 28:03.984
No, I am telling you.

28:03.985 --> 28:06.420
I'm legally blind
without my contacts in.

28:06.421 --> 28:08.823
First day I went
in my apartment, right?

28:08.824 --> 28:09.990
Give me two.

28:09.991 --> 28:11.625
I'm in the kitchen
eating cereal

28:11.626 --> 28:13.627
for literally five minutes.

28:13.628 --> 28:16.153
I hear someone coughing.
I put on my glasses.

28:16.231 --> 28:18.995
There's three men
painting my walls.

28:19.067 --> 28:20.668
I totally forgot
they were coming.

28:20.669 --> 28:21.902
Now, that's bad.

28:21.903 --> 28:23.804
No, the bad thing was
he was naked.

28:23.805 --> 28:25.706
- I was, yeah.
- Naked.

28:25.707 --> 28:28.801
I naked-clean.
It's cathartic.

28:28.910 --> 28:30.311
He loves to embarrass me.

28:30.312 --> 28:32.613
Wait, wait.
Define "naked-clean" for us.

28:32.614 --> 28:34.281
- I clean naked.
- Please, don't tell this story.

28:34.282 --> 28:37.410
I clean our apartment naked.
I like it. It's cathartic.

28:37.485 --> 28:39.320
He loves to embarrass me.

28:39.321 --> 28:41.222
I'm gonna see that
and raise it five.

28:41.223 --> 28:42.389
You're bluffing.

28:42.390 --> 28:44.592
You have the most obvious
tell on the planet.

28:44.593 --> 28:45.626
What? Whoa.

28:45.627 --> 28:48.994
Not even in the hardcorest
of ways do I bluff.

28:49.064 --> 28:51.564
You only raise
when you're bluffing.

28:52.801 --> 28:53.834
No, I don't.

28:53.835 --> 28:55.669
Full house.

28:57.839 --> 28:59.273
Damn it.

29:01.076 --> 29:02.543
When Will bluffs,
you can always tell.

29:02.544 --> 29:03.878
I'll be right back.

29:03.879 --> 29:06.379
How come I can never tell
with you?

29:07.415 --> 29:10.043
Okay. Wait, wait.

29:10.118 --> 29:11.285
What are you saying?

29:11.286 --> 29:13.786
All of the traffic cameras
were out that night.

29:13.822 --> 29:16.484
Okay, hold on.

29:16.558 --> 29:18.692
Within a mile
of Danny's apartment.

29:18.693 --> 29:19.960
Is that a normal thing?

29:19.961 --> 29:22.461
No. That doesn't sound
like a normal thing to me.

29:22.497 --> 29:24.298
I got Law Review at 6:00 A.M.

29:24.299 --> 29:26.927
Maybe we should go
while we're ahead?

29:27.002 --> 29:29.527
Oh, sure.
Thank you, Sydney.

29:31.172 --> 29:33.107
Good night.

29:33.108 --> 29:35.608
- Hey, see you later, Will.
- Bye, Will.

29:36.778 --> 29:39.146
Thank you, Jenny.
Thanks.

29:39.147 --> 29:41.348
That is weird, isn't it?

29:41.349 --> 29:43.849
Yeah. Okay.

29:45.186 --> 29:47.521
- What's weird?
- Huh?

29:47.522 --> 29:50.022
Oh, this stupid article
I got to write.

29:51.426 --> 29:54.088
- Look at this.
- Ooh.

29:54.162 --> 29:56.096
I don't know what it is
about tequila.

29:56.097 --> 29:57.665
- It's like a trigger.
- Yeah.

29:57.666 --> 29:59.667
I always get this craving.

29:59.668 --> 30:01.201
It's more than a craving.

30:01.202 --> 30:04.638
When I drink tequila,
ice cream becomes...

30:04.706 --> 30:06.006
Like a chaser?

30:06.007 --> 30:08.703
Like oxygen,
like a requirement.

30:08.810 --> 30:11.045
Freshman year, I didn't go
to many parties.

30:11.046 --> 30:13.776
Well, I could say any parties.
But I did go to this one.

30:13.848 --> 30:15.182
- Uh-huh.
- I remember.

30:15.183 --> 30:17.845
I had some punch.
It was mostly tequila.

30:17.919 --> 30:21.719
And, uh, I got so wasted.

30:21.790 --> 30:24.691
It was pathetic.

30:24.759 --> 30:27.259
I went to this 24-hour market.

30:27.295 --> 30:29.889
I bought 3 pints of chocolate
chocolate-chip ice cream.

30:29.965 --> 30:32.132
Oh, my God.
Is this story gonna end?

30:32.133 --> 30:34.633
Shut up.

30:36.271 --> 30:38.771
Oh.

30:39.207 --> 30:41.767
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

30:41.876 --> 30:43.510
Oh, my God.
This is excellent.

30:43.511 --> 30:44.778
Mmm, so much better.

30:44.779 --> 30:47.509
Shh, shh.
You got to try this.

30:47.582 --> 30:51.143
It's a super combination
of chocolate and chips,

30:51.219 --> 30:52.753
and it's genius.

30:52.754 --> 30:54.121
Hmm? Isn't it?

30:54.122 --> 30:55.556
Huh? Huh?

30:55.557 --> 30:58.057
Here.

31:02.397 --> 31:03.864
Thanks.

31:03.865 --> 31:04.932
I'm sorry.

31:04.933 --> 31:06.100
No, thank you.

31:06.101 --> 31:08.601
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

31:09.971 --> 31:12.496
- This is good.
- Oh, no.

31:12.607 --> 31:15.599
My shirt didn't have
enough ice cream on it.

31:15.710 --> 31:18.210
Oops.

31:27.489 --> 31:31.892
<i># I'll hold you close
in the back of my mind #</i>

31:34.662 --> 31:35.996
<i># Raise my glass #</i>

31:35.997 --> 31:37.398
I should...

31:37.399 --> 31:40.163
<i># 'Cause either way I'm dead #</i>

31:41.803 --> 31:42.936
<i># Neither of you #</i>

31:42.937 --> 31:44.671
Listen, I...

31:44.672 --> 31:47.766
<i># Really help me
to sleep anymore #</i>

31:51.112 --> 31:54.047
<i># One breaks my body #</i>

31:54.115 --> 31:56.845
<i># And the other
breaks my soul #</i>

31:57.986 --> 32:00.486
Will.

32:01.790 --> 32:04.290
I left that box in my car.

32:05.927 --> 32:08.427
It's Danny's.

32:10.932 --> 32:13.400
I'm gonna go get it
before I forget it.

32:13.401 --> 32:15.901
- Okay.
- Okay.

32:26.181 --> 32:27.981
Marshall couldn't open
the lockbox.

32:27.982 --> 32:30.849
In my defense, it was rigged
with a brand-new tech,

32:30.919 --> 32:33.419
an internal device that'll
destroy anything inside it

32:33.421 --> 32:34.822
if opened
without the actual key.

32:34.823 --> 32:36.156
Marshall, would you please
go back to work?

32:36.157 --> 32:38.225
Just to clarify,
I'm not being fired?

32:38.226 --> 32:39.793
"Back to work"
means "not fired."

32:39.794 --> 32:42.229
So we needed a contingency plan.

32:42.230 --> 32:44.892
So we called in
our best game theorist.

32:49.204 --> 32:51.704
Hello, Sydney.

32:53.374 --> 32:55.874
Have a seat.

32:56.177 --> 32:57.544
We mapped out a scenario

32:57.545 --> 32:59.913
where you would infiltrate
the K-Directorate lab

32:59.914 --> 33:01.982
where we believe
the key is being held.

33:01.983 --> 33:03.817
Jack thought that...

33:03.818 --> 33:07.515
Your father thought that
it could be too big of a risk.

33:07.589 --> 33:09.456
Why? It sounds like
the right move.

33:09.457 --> 33:11.158
Obviously, we need the key.

33:11.159 --> 33:13.659
Obviously, they need the box.

33:13.661 --> 33:16.130
Six hours ago,
I contacted K-Directorate.

33:16.131 --> 33:17.831
We settled on an arrangement.

33:17.832 --> 33:20.357
You and Anna will meet
at a neutral location

33:20.435 --> 33:22.935
under cover of both agencies'
security forces.

33:22.971 --> 33:25.531
Together
you'll open the lockbox.

33:25.640 --> 33:27.074
Is this a joke?

33:27.075 --> 33:28.942
As far as we know,
the Directorate doesn't know

33:28.943 --> 33:30.777
the code was divided
into two sketches.

33:30.778 --> 33:33.180
We have nothing to lose by
letting them see what's inside.

33:33.181 --> 33:34.748
This is a symmetric scenario.

33:34.749 --> 33:35.983
It compels both sides

33:35.984 --> 33:38.851
to adopt a mutually
reinforcing course of action.

33:38.920 --> 33:40.220
Close cooperation

33:40.221 --> 33:43.122
is one of the most stable
strategic paradigms.

33:43.191 --> 33:46.092
Assuming all the players
are rational.

33:46.161 --> 33:49.494
Plus, I'm just supposed to trust
Anna Espinosa?

33:50.532 --> 33:53.032
I need to brief
the advance team.

33:57.505 --> 33:59.139
The first plan was suicide.

33:59.140 --> 34:00.641
I could have handled myself.

34:00.642 --> 34:02.042
Then we disagree.

34:02.043 --> 34:04.077
At least my way,
you have a fighting chance.

34:04.078 --> 34:06.578
I guess I should thank you.

34:08.016 --> 34:10.516
Never crossed my mind.

34:11.152 --> 34:13.652
Dad?

34:16.024 --> 34:17.724
Before I go...

34:17.725 --> 34:21.525
just answer my question
about Mom.

34:27.302 --> 34:29.802
Your mother knew I was CIA.

34:30.772 --> 34:33.272
It was no secret between us.

34:35.944 --> 34:38.936
She died in the accident.

34:39.047 --> 34:41.547
I never lied about that.

35:02.370 --> 35:03.503
What is this?

35:03.504 --> 35:06.564
Two-way earpiece
and tracking chip.

35:06.674 --> 35:08.108
We want you to tag Anna.

35:08.109 --> 35:10.444
We've got a surveillance team
on alert in Berlin.

35:10.445 --> 35:12.112
Whose idea was this?

35:12.113 --> 35:14.548
This is my op,
Agent Bristow.

35:14.549 --> 35:17.382
This only works if everyone's
on their best behavior.

35:17.452 --> 35:20.046
I'm not gonna be
the one to break those rules,

35:20.121 --> 35:21.688
especially when there will be
a dozen snipers

35:21.689 --> 35:23.290
waiting for me
to look the wrong way.

35:23.291 --> 35:26.556
I hate to pull rank,
but time is a factor here.

35:26.628 --> 35:28.495
Time is a factor here.
You know how much time?

35:28.496 --> 35:31.465
Seven years. That's how long
I worked for SD-6

35:31.532 --> 35:34.092
before I found out who they
really are, and now that I know,

35:34.168 --> 35:36.693
my days of blindly
following orders are over.

35:36.771 --> 35:38.405
Who the hell do you think
you're talking to?

35:38.406 --> 35:40.040
I know exactly
who I'm talking to.

35:40.041 --> 35:41.842
Tell Devlin if Agent Vaughn

35:41.843 --> 35:44.869
isn't on the other end of this
earpiece when I turn it on,

35:44.979 --> 35:47.641
the CIA gets nothing.

35:47.715 --> 35:50.309
Vaughn is a junior officer.

35:51.319 --> 35:53.819
Then promote him.

35:57.959 --> 35:59.526
Daniel Hecht's apartment
was here.

35:59.527 --> 36:01.128
The cameras were off
from here to here.

36:01.129 --> 36:02.362
He was roughly in the center

36:02.363 --> 36:04.164
of a one-mile video blackout
the night he was killed.

36:04.165 --> 36:07.066
Unless this is a coincidence,
which seems doubtful,

36:07.135 --> 36:09.503
there's just no way
this is a straight B&E.

36:09.504 --> 36:12.064
Maybe, but Eisenberg
is on the crime desk.

36:12.140 --> 36:15.337
You are a staff reporter
who's way past deadline.

36:17.779 --> 36:21.237
Don't make me regret working
for people in their 50s.

36:21.349 --> 36:23.849
40s.

36:24.352 --> 36:26.852
One week.

36:36.664 --> 36:38.765
Francie, you're overreacting.

36:38.766 --> 36:41.266
Charlie's cheating
on me. I have proof.

36:41.369 --> 36:43.070
Found something in his pocket.

36:43.071 --> 36:45.767
It's a matchbook
with some girl's name

36:45.840 --> 36:47.407
and phone number written in it.

36:48.576 --> 36:50.243
Copy that.
We're five minutes out.

36:50.244 --> 36:52.179
You can't be paranoid.
That could mean anything.

36:52.180 --> 36:54.680
It says,
"I truly loved tonight. Rachel."

36:55.583 --> 36:57.651
The matchbook is from a hotel.

36:57.652 --> 36:58.885
Oh, Fran.

36:58.886 --> 37:00.454
Just don't assume the worst yet.

37:00.455 --> 37:02.122
You won't know
until you know.

37:02.123 --> 37:03.924
The truth isn't
always what it looks like.

37:05.493 --> 37:06.727
Syd, where are you?

37:06.728 --> 37:08.862
I'm with a German client.
Let me call you back.

37:13.735 --> 37:15.068
Everyone, listen up.

37:15.069 --> 37:16.536
Per agreement
with the Directorate,

37:16.537 --> 37:18.905
we're gonna divide the stadium
straight down the middle.

37:18.906 --> 37:20.974
They get the west side.
We get the east side.

37:20.975 --> 37:23.176
Alpha team, you're on
rear over watch

37:23.177 --> 37:24.911
just in case
they try to surprise us.

37:24.912 --> 37:27.779
Bravo and Charlie teams,
you're on countersniper.

37:27.849 --> 37:30.716
The rules of engagement are,
you're authorized to fire

37:30.785 --> 37:33.686
only if our assets
are fired upon.

37:33.755 --> 37:35.489
I'm tracking K-Directorate.

37:35.490 --> 37:37.990
They're taking position.

37:42.063 --> 37:43.630
Everyone, hold your positions.

37:43.631 --> 37:46.131
We're waiting for Bristow
to go hot-mike.

38:08.990 --> 38:10.390
Who am I talking to?

38:10.391 --> 38:12.759
Your invisible friend.

38:12.760 --> 38:14.828
Good. Where are you?

38:14.829 --> 38:16.897
Satellite relay station
back in L.A.,

38:16.898 --> 38:19.526
watching you
from a 200-mile orbit.

38:20.535 --> 38:23.035
My guardian angel.

38:23.337 --> 38:25.837
I was gonna say
the same thing to you.

38:26.808 --> 38:29.368
- Thanks for the promotion.
- You're welcome.

38:29.477 --> 38:31.977
Heads up.

38:38.019 --> 38:39.586
- Team leader, we're hot.
- Copy that.

38:39.587 --> 38:42.087
She's coming.

38:42.924 --> 38:46.018
Have you two spoken
about her mother?

38:47.862 --> 38:49.429
Yes.

38:49.430 --> 38:51.097
She asked me about her death.

38:51.098 --> 38:53.598
Did you tell her the truth?

39:54.595 --> 39:56.897
How's your Russian these days?

40:06.173 --> 40:08.375
I heard about your fiancé.

40:08.376 --> 40:10.876
Very sad.

40:10.878 --> 40:13.813
I thought perhaps it was
a security execution

40:13.881 --> 40:16.381
sanctioned by your employers.

40:17.351 --> 40:19.876
Maybe you said something
in your sleep

40:19.954 --> 40:22.454
you shouldn't have.

40:23.524 --> 40:26.925
But, then, why would
you be here in service

40:26.994 --> 40:30.430
of the men
that killed your true love?

40:39.907 --> 40:42.407
- I take it you brought the key.
- I take it you brought the box.

40:42.510 --> 40:45.502
Once we see what's inside,
we go our separate ways.

41:22.216 --> 41:24.716
Oh, my God.

41:25.305 --> 41:31.161
