00:02.502 --> 00:06.271
<i>[Lacey] There's no greater
pleasure in this world than eating food.</i>

00:06.273 --> 00:09.208
<i>It's a more pleasure button
for me than sex.</i>

00:16.383 --> 00:18.984
<i>[woman 1] Somewhere in
me is this little glimmer of hope.</i>

00:18.986 --> 00:21.620
<i>I just wanna be a normal person.</i>

00:21.622 --> 00:23.355
[exhales sharply]

00:32.766 --> 00:36.001
[man] You can't do it
and then I just get mad.

00:36.003 --> 00:40.005
<i>[woman 2] If I don't make a change
now, I'm scared it's gonna be too late.</i>

00:43.209 --> 00:46.779
[groaning] No, it hurts!

00:46.781 --> 00:51.183
<i>[woman 3] I refuse to stop fighting.
I have to do this for my children.</i>

00:57.090 --> 00:59.491
[woman 4] You are not ready
to lose weight.

00:59.493 --> 01:04.163
You did absolutely
mother [bleep] nothing.

01:36.896 --> 01:40.933
<i>[Lacey] I wake up every
morning feeling intense pain.</i>

01:41.801 --> 01:43.635
<i>It's constant now,</i>

01:43.637 --> 01:47.039
<i>and there's no part of my body
that doesn't hurt.</i>

01:47.373 --> 01:50.876
<i>Having crackling in my bones,</i>

01:50.878 --> 01:55.747
<i>heat rash in places that never
goes away, no matter how clean I am.</i>

01:55.749 --> 01:58.951
<i>I have stabbing pain in my feet</i>

01:58.953 --> 02:03.222
<i>and really dull, crushing pain
in my lower back.</i>

02:03.623 --> 02:05.424
It's not a fun time.

02:05.426 --> 02:11.063
<i>My right knee is the worst
pain I've ever had in my life.</i>

02:11.065 --> 02:15.667
<i>I struggle with diabetes, high
cholesterol, high blood pressure,</i>

02:15.669 --> 02:19.605
<i>and it's all because
of my weight.</i>

02:19.607 --> 02:22.407
<i>My body is crushing itself.</i>

02:22.409 --> 02:25.878
When I do get up,
I move like a T. rex

02:25.880 --> 02:28.780
because my steps...

02:28.782 --> 02:31.550
some of them are big,
but so slow.

02:31.552 --> 02:33.852
<i>I'm so big.</i>

02:33.854 --> 02:40.459
<i>And I'm very short of breath almost immediately
doing anything where I have to move.</i>

02:40.461 --> 02:44.630
My lungs just, they're
suffocating in this body.

02:44.632 --> 02:50.736
<i>But I do get up. I try to keep up
with my basic hygiene every day.</i>

02:50.738 --> 02:53.172
<i>I only shower
once or twice a week.</i>

02:53.174 --> 02:57.176
<i>I use wet wipes to clean
myself the other times.</i>

02:58.311 --> 02:59.578
<i>It's just hard.</i>

03:00.046 --> 03:03.916
<i>But I usually just stand for
as little time as possible,</i>

03:03.918 --> 03:06.652
<i>so I don't pass out
from losing my breath.</i>

03:06.654 --> 03:08.887
<i>And I do have to have help, now,</i>

03:08.889 --> 03:11.957
<i>especially with certain things.</i>

03:11.959 --> 03:15.894
I have not been able
to wipe myself in seven years

03:15.896 --> 03:20.132
<i>and sometimes that
responsibility falls to my boyfriend.</i>

03:20.833 --> 03:22.734
I do have a boyfriend.

03:22.736 --> 03:25.571
<i>I met him a month ago
on a dating site</i>

03:25.573 --> 03:28.874
<i>and since then, we've seen
each other every single day.</i>

03:28.876 --> 03:32.978
<i>I was up front with him
about my situation,</i>

03:32.980 --> 03:34.680
<i>so he understood
what he's getting into.</i>

03:34.682 --> 03:39.518
<i>But I still feel bad about
needing his help like I do.</i>

03:39.520 --> 03:42.054
<i>But we're really enjoying
each other's company</i>

03:42.056 --> 03:44.089
<i>and I feel very blessed
to have meet him.</i>

03:44.091 --> 03:45.924
[sighs]

03:45.926 --> 03:46.992
[knock on the door]

03:46.994 --> 03:48.360
Come in.

03:49.095 --> 03:50.128
[Ricky] Hey, babe.

03:50.130 --> 03:52.631
Hey, honey.

03:52.633 --> 03:56.368
<i>[Ricky] Lacey is that type of person
that'll give you the shirt off her back.</i>

03:57.203 --> 04:00.539
That loving, caring,
snuggle-bear kind of person.

04:00.541 --> 04:03.775
<i>So, Lacey asked me
to come to the bathroom.</i>

04:03.777 --> 04:06.078
<i>Sometimes I do help her
to wipe herself.</i>

04:06.080 --> 04:08.580
<i>And it doesn't bother me</i>

04:08.582 --> 04:10.849
<i>because I love her a lot.</i>

04:10.851 --> 04:14.152
<i>And I really like
to keep Lacey happy.</i>

04:15.955 --> 04:18.790
<i>[Lacey] My greatest love
in life is food.</i>

04:18.792 --> 04:22.127
<i>I absolutely love food.</i>

04:22.129 --> 04:25.864
Make sure you put butter
in the skillet for the bacon.

04:25.866 --> 04:26.732
That's fine.

04:26.734 --> 04:30.636
I consider myself a bad,
bad food addict.

04:30.638 --> 04:33.505
Like it's a IV pump into my arm.

04:33.507 --> 04:34.939
<i>And as far as I'm concerned,</i>

04:34.941 --> 04:38.977
<i>there's no greater pleasure
in this world than eating food.</i>

04:38.979 --> 04:41.780
It's a more pleasure button
for me than sex.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.548
It pleasures me.

04:43.550 --> 04:46.118
<i>Food. It's everything to me.</i>

04:46.120 --> 04:48.420
<i>From even my earliest memories,</i>

04:48.422 --> 04:51.323
<i>that's how it's
always been for me.</i>

04:57.530 --> 05:01.833
<i>Growing up in my family was
emotionally and physically exhausting.</i>

05:01.835 --> 05:05.003
<i>I had an older sister
and brother.</i>

05:07.040 --> 05:08.807
<i>My brother was
the favorite child.</i>

05:08.809 --> 05:12.778
<i>My sister was
so skinny and popular.</i>

05:12.780 --> 05:16.214
<i>I kind of felt like
I should have been adopted.</i>

05:16.649 --> 05:19.351
My dad had some anger issues,

05:20.820 --> 05:23.889
<i>and I didn't have much
of a relationship with him.</i>

05:23.891 --> 05:26.725
<i>But I had a worse relationship
with my mom</i>

05:26.727 --> 05:29.628
<i>because I never
felt like she wanted me.</i>

05:29.630 --> 05:31.763
Lacey was our surprise baby.

05:31.765 --> 05:35.867
<i>I had an IUD
but it got out of place.</i>

05:35.869 --> 05:40.839
<i>When I was writing Christmas
cards, I'd get real emotional.</i>

05:40.841 --> 05:44.543
That told me, "Oh, my gosh.
I think I'm pregnant."

05:44.610 --> 05:47.346
<i>Yep. [laughs]</i>

05:48.781 --> 05:54.386
<i>When I was very young, she told me
that I was an IUD baby, and an accident.</i>

05:54.388 --> 05:56.588
It made me feel like a disaster.

05:56.590 --> 06:01.426
<i>So, my self esteem was
disgustingly low as a child.</i>

06:01.428 --> 06:05.297
<i>Therefore, I ate because
it's what brought me comfort.</i>

06:05.299 --> 06:07.666
<i>So, I started gaining weight
from the very beginning.</i>

06:07.668 --> 06:12.704
<i>By the time I was six or
seven, I was around 120 pounds.</i>

06:12.706 --> 06:16.007
<i>[Eve] When Lacey was growing up,
sometimes we would try to limit her food.</i>

06:16.009 --> 06:19.878
But she was headstrong.
It didn't go over very well.

06:19.880 --> 06:23.382
<i>[Lacey] But my weight gain
got even worse as I got older</i>

06:23.384 --> 06:27.686
<i>and really started to soar
when I was ten years old.</i>

06:27.688 --> 06:32.290
<i>That was when I needed something
like food to help me escape.</i>

06:33.192 --> 06:35.961
- Hey, Ricky, can I have the butter?
- Yeah, baby.

06:35.963 --> 06:38.263
Please, I need, uh,
extra butter on my pancakes.

06:38.265 --> 06:39.998
Okay, babe.

06:40.000 --> 06:45.637
<i>The summer before third grade, I began
hanging out with a new kid on the block.</i>

06:45.639 --> 06:49.608
<i>And we were playing one day, and
he wanted me to go over to his house.</i>

06:49.610 --> 06:54.413
<i>And when I went over, his older
brother lived in the basement</i>

06:54.415 --> 06:58.884
<i>and I was dragged
to the basement by my friend</i>

06:58.886 --> 07:01.853
for his older brother
to have sex with me.

07:01.855 --> 07:04.656
It was a horrific experience.

07:04.658 --> 07:08.994
<i>I didn't know what to do and I
didn't think anyone would believe me.</i>

07:08.996 --> 07:12.564
So, I never told anyone about
this till I was in college.

07:12.566 --> 07:15.500
So, technically,
he got away with it.

07:15.502 --> 07:18.270
<i>So, after that, my weight
spiraled out of control</i>

07:18.272 --> 07:20.739
<i>because I was just
constantly eating.</i>

07:20.741 --> 07:25.911
<i>And that lead me to over 200
pounds by the time I was 11.</i>

07:25.913 --> 07:29.815
<i>And, of course,
I got bullied a lot in school.</i>

07:29.817 --> 07:35.554
<i>I didn't really have friends. I had food
and all I really wanted to do was eat.</i>

07:35.556 --> 07:38.924
<i>So, my weight just kept going
up all through high school.</i>

07:38.926 --> 07:44.162
<i>And when I graduated when I
was 18, I was around 420 pounds.</i>

07:44.164 --> 07:47.399
<i>And right around
when I started college,</i>

07:47.401 --> 07:51.336
I started having bleeding problems and
hormone problems with my menstrual cycle.

07:51.338 --> 07:54.873
<i>Then my mom
took me to the doctor</i>

07:54.875 --> 07:59.277
<i>because I kept having issues and
the doctors were trying to figure it out.</i>

07:59.279 --> 08:01.947
<i>They asked me some questions
to answer honestly,</i>

08:01.949 --> 08:05.550
<i>so I had to tell them that I
was raped in the third grade</i>

08:05.552 --> 08:07.752
<i>and that's when
my parents found out.</i>

08:07.754 --> 08:11.490
<i>My dad believed me,
but my mom never did.</i>

08:11.492 --> 08:14.526
<i>So, that became a roadblock
in our relationship</i>

08:14.528 --> 08:18.763
<i>that I don't think
we'll ever recover from.</i>

08:18.765 --> 08:23.435
<i>Right after that, I moved out of my parent's
house and into the dorms at college.</i>

08:23.437 --> 08:28.340
<i>Being on my own, allowed me to
take binge eating to a whole new level</i>

08:28.342 --> 08:31.977
<i>and I just ate my way
through college.</i>

08:31.979 --> 08:35.881
<i>So, by the time I was out of
college, I was over 500 pounds.</i>

08:35.883 --> 08:39.918
<i>I started working a customer
service job to take care of myself.</i>

08:39.920 --> 08:42.120
<i>But it was too much
for me and my body.</i>

08:42.122 --> 08:44.823
Here's two, babe,
I'll make you two more.

08:44.857 --> 08:46.458
Thanks.

08:46.460 --> 08:48.660
<i>[Eve] I think a little bit of it</i>

08:48.662 --> 08:51.963
<i>was being judged by others
and judged at school.</i>

08:52.365 --> 08:54.032
She had a nervous breakdown.

08:56.235 --> 08:57.168
[Lacey] Tastes
really good, honey.

08:57.170 --> 08:59.938
[Ricky] Thank you, baby.

08:59.940 --> 09:04.743
<i>[Lacey] So after that, I just stayed home
all the time and I got extremely lonely.</i>

09:04.745 --> 09:09.414
<i>But when I was 26, I found a
group of people on the internet</i>

09:09.416 --> 09:11.816
<i>who are a part of
what's called Feederism.</i>

09:11.818 --> 09:15.921
Feederism is when, on the
internet, girls make money

09:15.923 --> 09:18.189
<i>from getting men to give them
money for food</i>

09:18.191 --> 09:21.326
<i>and them eating it
on the camera.</i>

09:21.328 --> 09:25.730
<i>It wasn't hard for me to find men on the
internet who wanted to take care of me.</i>

09:25.732 --> 09:29.334
<i>And all I had to do was film
myself eating as part of the deal.</i>

09:29.336 --> 09:32.337
<i>And, I liked the attention,
to be honest.</i>

09:33.839 --> 09:37.742
<i>Technically, I've been in three
feeder relationships with men.</i>

09:37.744 --> 09:40.312
But, I haven't done that
in a long time.

09:41.914 --> 09:44.516
<i>Thankfully, I have Ricky now,</i>

09:44.518 --> 09:46.418
<i>who's not like those other guys</i>

09:46.420 --> 09:47.586
<i>because he wants
the best for me.</i>

09:47.588 --> 09:51.022
<i>So, we're together now,
and I'm thankful to heaven.</i>

09:51.024 --> 09:55.994
<i>Not just to have somebody to help
me, but because I know he loves me.</i>

09:57.997 --> 09:59.097
How are you doing?

09:59.999 --> 10:02.100
I'm doing good.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.269
I'm just, uh,
chatting with my sister.

10:04.271 --> 10:06.204
The girls say hi.

10:06.206 --> 10:07.305
Hi, girls.

10:08.140 --> 10:12.010
These sandwiches
are so finger sucking good.

10:12.012 --> 10:13.979
[Ricky] Thank you, babe.

10:14.847 --> 10:16.481
It's the first time
I feel loved.

10:16.483 --> 10:18.483
As, with a boy, really.

10:18.485 --> 10:22.220
<i>And that's motivating me,
even more now, to get healthy.</i>

10:22.222 --> 10:26.157
<i>Because I want to have a
better life and do things with him.</i>

10:26.159 --> 10:28.960
<i>But food it still
so important to me.</i>

10:28.962 --> 10:32.330
<i>So, how do I give up
what makes me happy?</i>

10:38.971 --> 10:40.371
I'll get the door, babe.

10:41.941 --> 10:45.610
[Lacey] I don't know if it's gonna
go through that. Move the couch.

10:45.612 --> 10:47.145
Can you move the couch, please?

10:47.147 --> 10:48.980
I can't get through.
I'm too big.

10:58.557 --> 11:01.826
<i>You know, if Ricky's going
grocery shopping,</i>

11:01.828 --> 11:07.098
<i>I'll push myself through the pain
so I can just be around all that food.</i>

11:07.633 --> 11:09.367
<i>You know, neither of us drive.</i>

11:09.369 --> 11:13.171
<i>But thankfully, now, we have
Ricky's sister, Sharon.</i>

11:13.173 --> 11:16.808
<i>She comes and takes us and
that's been a godsend to me.</i>

11:16.810 --> 11:18.009
Hi, Sharon.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.344
[Sharon] What's up with you?

11:20.746 --> 11:22.414
Come on, babe.

11:22.416 --> 11:25.016
I can't. It's hard
for my shoulder.

11:26.185 --> 11:29.354
Yeah, one second. One second.
I can't reach it yet.

11:29.989 --> 11:31.322
My knee.

11:33.693 --> 11:36.294
Okay, I'm in. Thank you.

11:42.835 --> 11:45.603
Get, like, three
packages of bacon.

11:45.605 --> 11:47.372
[Ricky] All right.
Three packages of bacon.

11:48.641 --> 11:51.376
Here's some chocolate
fudge cake, that'd be good.

11:51.378 --> 11:54.946
<i>Every bite I'm taking
is helping to kill me, now.</i>

11:54.948 --> 11:56.881
There's ice cream. You know
how much I like ice cream.

11:56.883 --> 11:57.949
[Ricky] Which one?

11:57.951 --> 11:59.851
How about, cookies and cream?

11:59.853 --> 12:01.886
[Ricky] Whoa, girl.

12:01.888 --> 12:04.055
<i>[Lacey] And I can feel it
in my body now.</i>

12:05.658 --> 12:07.325
[Ricky] Okay?

12:09.061 --> 12:10.528
- [Ricky] That one?
- [Lacy] Yeah. That's good for me.

12:10.530 --> 12:11.996
[Ricky] Okay.

12:13.866 --> 12:17.268
<i>I've had pain in my body
so many times.</i>

12:17.270 --> 12:20.805
<i>But not like it is now.
It's different now.</i>

12:20.807 --> 12:22.040
I've gotta
sit down again, sorry.

12:22.042 --> 12:23.908
[Ricky] Take your time, babe.
Take your time.

12:23.910 --> 12:25.243
[Lacey sighs]

12:25.644 --> 12:28.613
<i>Because the pain is worse.</i>

12:28.615 --> 12:31.049
<i>And I've started
to feel like I'm dying.</i>

12:31.550 --> 12:32.784
Just a minute,
I've got to breathe.

12:32.786 --> 12:35.620
<i>Especially in my heart and lungs</i>

12:35.622 --> 12:40.325
because my lungs are weak
and my heart's weak.

12:40.860 --> 12:43.361
<i>And it's just getting worse.</i>

12:47.500 --> 12:50.835
I do think Lacey has a weight
problem, but it doesn't bother me.

12:50.837 --> 12:53.938
<i>I'm used to it, I guess,
'cause I grew up</i>

12:53.940 --> 12:55.673
with my own weight problems.

12:55.675 --> 12:58.209
<i>It just means we both
could loose weight,</i>

12:58.211 --> 13:01.346
'cause I'm not myself skinny.

13:02.047 --> 13:03.248
[Sharon] Yes, you too.

13:06.185 --> 13:07.852
[Ricky] Okay. Slow down.

13:07.854 --> 13:12.957
<i>[Lacey] I know I'm not too far from
something really bad happening to me.</i>

13:12.959 --> 13:14.893
<i>And I'm scared about
what could happen now.</i>

13:14.895 --> 13:17.061
[Sharon] Think this is enough?

13:18.197 --> 13:21.199
Okay. Slow down.
Slow down, slow down, baby.

13:22.434 --> 13:24.102
Okay, slow down.

13:25.171 --> 13:26.905
- [Lacey] No.
- [Ricky] All right, ready? One, two...

13:26.907 --> 13:29.174
[Lacey] No, no.

13:29.176 --> 13:33.111
Let me do it. I gotta get...
[gasps for breath]

13:34.313 --> 13:35.413
Okay.

13:36.982 --> 13:38.116
Ow.

13:38.417 --> 13:39.584
All good?

13:39.586 --> 13:41.419
[Lacey] Yeah, okay.

13:43.422 --> 13:46.090
<i>The more I eat,
the worse it gets.</i>

13:47.927 --> 13:49.060
<i>I pray</i>

13:49.062 --> 13:50.995
<i>I'm not already passed</i>

13:51.363 --> 13:52.997
<i>a point of no return.</i>

13:56.435 --> 13:58.903
<i>I have simple dreams.</i>

13:58.905 --> 14:00.939
I just want to go to the mall
and be able to walk around

14:00.941 --> 14:02.106
and shop.

14:02.541 --> 14:03.441
<i>[Lacey] That's it.</i>

14:04.210 --> 14:05.977
- [Ricky] Yeah.
- [Lacey] Slower, slower...

14:06.846 --> 14:07.879
[Lacey groans]

14:07.913 --> 14:09.547
[Lacey] I'm gonna puke.

14:09.549 --> 14:10.949
[Ricky] Don't puke on it...
Don't puke on this.

14:10.951 --> 14:12.383
- Please don't puke on the...
- [Lacey] Ow, ow.

14:17.923 --> 14:19.023
[Ricky] Come on, baby.

14:19.025 --> 14:20.091
[Lacey] Don't pull me.

14:20.159 --> 14:21.059
Slower.

14:21.061 --> 14:22.660
<i>[Lacey] And now with Ricky
in my life,</i>

14:22.662 --> 14:24.863
<i>I want to have
a future with him.</i>

14:24.865 --> 14:27.098
<i>And when you're
as overweight as I am,</i>

14:27.766 --> 14:29.200
<i>that kind of life</i>

14:29.835 --> 14:31.002
<i>just isn't possible.</i>

14:31.004 --> 14:32.871
<i>And instead,</i>

14:32.873 --> 14:35.073
I'm just trapped in
all this fat.

14:35.608 --> 14:36.941
<i>It's my prison</i>

14:36.943 --> 14:39.410
<i>and it's a nightmare most days.</i>

14:39.412 --> 14:40.612
<i>So whatever it takes</i>

14:40.713 --> 14:43.848
<i>I have to try and get better
and lose the weight.</i>

14:43.850 --> 14:46.084
<i>I just hope it's not too late.</i>

14:49.788 --> 14:51.322
[piano music playing]

15:02.568 --> 15:04.135
[Lacey] Cheesy puffs?

15:04.137 --> 15:05.937
- [Ricky] Yep, got a-- Got it.
- [Lacey] Soda?

15:05.939 --> 15:07.171
[Lacey] Coffee?

15:07.173 --> 15:08.940
[Ricky] Yep, oh the coffees?
Yep, yep.

15:08.942 --> 15:09.974
[Lacey] Root beer?

15:09.976 --> 15:10.742
[Ricky] Okay.

15:10.744 --> 15:12.644
Don't forget my chocolate.

15:12.646 --> 15:15.013
[Ricky] Definitely, babe.
I won't forget chocolate.

15:15.848 --> 15:18.783
<i>[Lacey] I've decided to try
and go see Dr. Now</i>

15:18.785 --> 15:21.019
<i>in Houston
to see if he can help me.</i>

15:21.086 --> 15:23.021
<i>It's not going to be easy,</i>

15:23.555 --> 15:24.989
<i>but thankfully I have Ricky</i>

15:24.991 --> 15:26.758
<i>who is going to help me do this.</i>

15:26.760 --> 15:28.159
Hey, babe, you need this?

15:30.095 --> 15:31.729
- Yes.
- All right, all right.

15:31.731 --> 15:35.033
<i>Lacey deserves
the opportunity to change.</i>

15:35.035 --> 15:36.801
I'm pretty hopeful
she'll get accepted

15:36.803 --> 15:39.404
<i>into this program with Dr. Now</i>

15:39.406 --> 15:40.905
because I just want her
to definitely

15:40.907 --> 15:42.774
get the help she needs
to take care of her body

15:42.776 --> 15:44.976
and get herself back on track.

15:46.545 --> 15:49.781
<i>And so, I'm 100% committed.
I am going with her</i>

15:49.783 --> 15:51.416
to take care of my girlfriend
'cause she needs me.

15:53.018 --> 15:54.285
Getting my workout.

15:56.989 --> 15:59.123
<i>[Lacey] It's over 2,000-miles</i>

15:59.125 --> 16:00.992
<i>and more than
a full day's drive.</i>

16:01.059 --> 16:02.060
<i>So the plan is</i>

16:02.062 --> 16:03.628
<i>to try to split the travel load</i>

16:03.630 --> 16:05.229
<i>between today and tomorrow.</i>

16:07.032 --> 16:08.866
<i>That'll give me
a little time to rest up some</i>

16:08.868 --> 16:10.335
<i>before I have my appointment.</i>

16:13.906 --> 16:15.540
<i>Because this whole thing</i>

16:15.542 --> 16:18.076
<i>is gonna be extremely hard
on my body.</i>

16:19.311 --> 16:20.645
- [Lacey] Sorry, I'm tired.
- Oh, don't pull the...

16:20.647 --> 16:22.680
Why don't you go sit in the car?

16:22.682 --> 16:25.083
- And I'll get the rest of the stuff.
- Yeah, I'll go get in the car.

16:25.884 --> 16:27.986
<i>[Lacey] But neither of us
can drive.</i>

16:27.988 --> 16:30.154
<i>So Ricky asked
his sister, Sharon,</i>

16:30.156 --> 16:31.990
<i>to help drive us there.</i>

16:32.057 --> 16:33.958
<i>And she said she would.</i>

16:35.728 --> 16:36.728
[Lacey] Hi, Sharon.

16:36.730 --> 16:37.428
[Sharon] Sup with ya?

16:37.896 --> 16:39.831
[Lacey] Haven't seen you.

16:39.833 --> 16:41.165
[Sharon] Staying low, you know?

16:41.934 --> 16:42.633
<i>I'm the driver.</i>

16:42.635 --> 16:44.202
<i>I got volunteered.</i>

16:44.204 --> 16:46.137
<i>Then Mom was like, "Oh,
no. Ricky's going to Texas?</i>

16:46.139 --> 16:47.038
<i>So is Sharon."</i>

16:47.040 --> 16:47.972
<i>I was like, "[bleep]</i>

16:47.974 --> 16:49.707
<i>I don't want to go to Texas."</i>

16:49.709 --> 16:52.076
<i>Like, "Okay, let' go
make sure my brother Ricky</i>

16:52.078 --> 16:52.810
<i>is safe, you know."</i>

16:52.812 --> 16:54.045
<i>That's what I do.</i>

16:54.446 --> 16:56.180
[Ricky] You need help, babe?

16:56.182 --> 16:58.716
Can you lose the stuff
in the pouch and stuff?

16:58.718 --> 17:00.351
'Cause Ricky is
actually epileptic,

17:00.753 --> 17:02.420
<i>and he has seizures.</i>

17:02.422 --> 17:04.522
So I had to be there
because he stops breathing.

17:04.524 --> 17:06.591
- Sorry, just need the space.
- [Ricky] No, babe. No, nope.

17:06.593 --> 17:09.761
[Ricky] Gotta make it comfy. I want
you comfortable, baby. Comfortable.

17:09.763 --> 17:12.897
But also, he's sheltered.
He doesn't really know much.

17:12.899 --> 17:15.933
- Get in the other side and pull me in?
- Yeah, babe.

17:15.935 --> 17:17.835
<i>[Sharon] So with his girlfriends</i>

17:17.837 --> 17:20.905
I gotta step in
and put him through the ringer

17:20.907 --> 17:23.074
to see if they're gonna
actually be there for him,

17:23.076 --> 17:25.009
or if they're just using him.

17:25.577 --> 17:27.311
- Uh, no.
- [Ricky] I got ya.

17:27.313 --> 17:28.946
- Please.
- [Ricky] I'm not doing anything.

17:28.948 --> 17:31.816
- Don't make me fall.
- [Ricky] Oh, I won't. Just give me your arm.

17:31.818 --> 17:34.352
- [Lacey] Stop, please stop.
- [Ricky] I ain't... I'm just holding...

17:35.421 --> 17:37.388
[Lacey] Oh, put your hand
over here. No.

17:37.956 --> 17:39.157
Owie.

17:41.727 --> 17:42.994
[gasps] I can't do this.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.845
Hey, can we stop and get

18:00.847 --> 18:04.348
tacos, or burgers, or fries?

18:05.017 --> 18:06.417
Getting' kind of hungry.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.486
[Ricky] Yeah, that sounds good.

18:08.488 --> 18:09.921
<i>[Lacey] I'm already
feeling exhausted,</i>

18:09.923 --> 18:12.423
<i>and it's only been 30 minutes
since we left.</i>

18:14.426 --> 18:16.594
Ooh, babe,
mashed potatoes and gravy,

18:16.596 --> 18:18.096
cole slaw.

18:18.098 --> 18:19.864
[Sharon] Girl, why don't you
get the Famous Bowl?

18:19.866 --> 18:21.766
[Lacey] Yeah, I know
I like those.

18:21.768 --> 18:24.702
<i>But we have so much
distance to go.</i>

18:24.704 --> 18:26.270
<i>So I just need to get
enough food</i>

18:26.272 --> 18:28.039
<i>to last for a bit.</i>

18:31.210 --> 18:34.245
[Lacey] I'd like
eight extra crispy drumsticks,

18:34.247 --> 18:35.813
a large corndog,

18:35.815 --> 18:37.415
a large cheese curd,

18:37.417 --> 18:39.417
Papa burger with extra,
extra bacon,

18:39.419 --> 18:42.019
and I'll take a root beer.

18:42.021 --> 18:43.554
- [woman] Anything else?
- Mashed potatoes and gravy.

18:43.556 --> 18:44.889
[Sharon] I need a, uh...

18:44.891 --> 18:46.757
An order of mashed potatoes
and gravy please.

18:46.759 --> 18:47.625
[Sharon] Thank you.

19:11.350 --> 19:12.817
<i>[Lacey] So, this is
just scaring me</i>

19:12.819 --> 19:14.352
<i>to be on the road so long.</i>

19:15.821 --> 19:17.288
<i>Part of me wants to turn back.</i>

19:19.992 --> 19:21.325
<i>But I can't</i>

19:22.060 --> 19:24.095
<i>because my life depends on this.</i>

19:40.012 --> 19:41.078
I'm trying not to lose it.

19:41.880 --> 19:42.980
[Ricky] I'm sorry, baby.

19:43.882 --> 19:44.882
Take your time.

19:45.817 --> 19:48.219
<i>[Lacey] It's our second day
on the road.</i>

19:48.221 --> 19:51.122
<i>My legs hurt,
excruciating pain right now.</i>

19:51.990 --> 19:53.591
<i>Very swollen
and they're bigger than</i>

19:53.593 --> 19:56.160
<i>they've been in a long time.</i>

19:57.829 --> 19:59.730
<i>The thought that
we're not even halfway there</i>

19:59.732 --> 20:00.798
<i>is very hard on me,</i>

20:00.800 --> 20:02.934
<i>but gotta keep going.</i>

20:02.936 --> 20:05.069
- There.
- [Ricky] Okay, baby, closing.

20:05.071 --> 20:06.304
- [Sharon] You good?
- Yeah.

20:08.006 --> 20:09.307
[Ricky] Tell me to stop, babe.

20:10.909 --> 20:12.843
<i>[Lacey] I'm doing
the very best I can.</i>

20:12.845 --> 20:14.478
<i>I know we can get there.</i>

20:14.480 --> 20:16.881
<i>Just gonna take a little while</i>

20:16.883 --> 20:18.349
<i>and I gotta get there
by my appointment,</i>

20:19.017 --> 20:20.985
<i>or else I lost out.</i>

20:22.421 --> 20:23.921
<i>I'm desperate for his help.</i>

20:23.923 --> 20:25.990
<i>So as hard as it is</i>

20:26.892 --> 20:28.826
<i>I'm trying to push myself.</i>

20:28.828 --> 20:29.727
<i>But at least,</i>

20:29.729 --> 20:31.829
<i>I was able to get
a good breakfast.</i>

20:31.831 --> 20:34.098
<i>Before putting myself
through all this again.</i>

20:34.733 --> 20:35.833
Had a really

20:35.835 --> 20:38.402
nice breakfast Zebra Cakes,

20:38.404 --> 20:41.439
and cheese puffs,
and coffee, and...

20:41.441 --> 20:42.873
[Sharon] You need to worry
about losing the [bleep] weight,

20:42.875 --> 20:46.611
- and you gotta motivate your [bleep] self.
- Mm-hmm.

20:46.613 --> 20:49.647
[Sharon] And no one's gonna
[bleep] hand you [bleep].

20:49.649 --> 20:51.616
- [Sharon] 'Cause nothing in this
world's free-- - [Lacey] I never--

20:51.618 --> 20:53.751
- [Sharon] And people have
other-- - [Lacey] I never said that--

20:53.753 --> 20:54.852
[Sharon] People have
themselves to worry about

20:54.854 --> 20:56.754
before they worry
about other people.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.623
It's going to hard though,
I'm gonna let you know--

20:58.625 --> 21:00.691
- [Lacey] It's gonna be really hard.
- Which is,

21:00.693 --> 21:04.061
as long as you staying
dedicated to your [bleep]

21:04.063 --> 21:06.631
and motivated on what you
want to do, you'll get it done.

21:06.633 --> 21:08.132
Yeah.

21:11.870 --> 21:14.105
<i>[Sharon] I give everybody
the benefit of the doubt,</i>

21:14.107 --> 21:17.074
but I'm a good people's person

21:17.076 --> 21:18.943
and I can read people, like,

21:18.977 --> 21:20.778
really easily.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.647
<i>She's not showing any efforts</i>

21:22.649 --> 21:23.714
<i>to lose the weight,</i>

21:23.716 --> 21:25.016
<i>do you know what I'm saying?</i>

21:25.018 --> 21:26.884
Like, she's not gonna be able to

21:26.918 --> 21:29.053
<i>do Dr. Now.</i>

21:31.623 --> 21:34.091
We'll get you a shirt
that says Team Lacey.

21:34.093 --> 21:35.960
- [Ricky] Team Lacey.
- Team Lacey!

21:35.962 --> 21:37.128
[Ricky] Team Lacey.

21:48.507 --> 21:49.907
[Lacey] What a day.

21:49.909 --> 21:51.809
- [Ricky] What a day.
- [Lacey] What a day.

21:51.811 --> 21:53.077
[Ricky] Beautiful day, actually.

21:54.046 --> 21:55.179
[Lacey] Hi, Sis.

21:55.181 --> 21:56.147
[Sharon] Hi, hey.

21:57.082 --> 21:57.882
[Sharon] I got her.

21:57.884 --> 21:59.183
[Lacey] Yep.

22:01.820 --> 22:03.220
- [Lacey] I got it.
- [Ricky] I know.

22:03.222 --> 22:04.355
Make sure you don't fall out.

22:05.624 --> 22:08.759
Let's go, girls.
Get it going.

22:08.761 --> 22:11.128
- [Sharon] Get in the truck.
- [Ricky] Let's saddle up.

22:15.067 --> 22:16.600
<i>[Lacey] It's our third day
on the road.</i>

22:16.602 --> 22:17.702
<i>Houston,</i>

22:17.704 --> 22:19.804
<i>we were supposed to
be there by now.</i>

22:19.806 --> 22:22.239
<i>Because my appointment
was today.</i>

22:23.408 --> 22:25.409
<i>But we've only
made it till Utah.</i>

22:25.411 --> 22:27.011
<i>So we had to ask Dr. Now</i>

22:27.013 --> 22:28.379
<i>if we can move the appointment,</i>

22:28.747 --> 22:30.781
<i>and he did that.</i>

22:30.783 --> 22:32.983
<i>But we're still 19 hours
from Houston.</i>

22:33.752 --> 22:34.852
<i>So for today,</i>

22:34.854 --> 22:37.455
<i>we're gonna drive and drive
as much as we can.</i>

22:37.457 --> 22:41.792
<i>I know that I'm not as hungry
as I was yesterday.</i>

22:41.794 --> 22:44.328
<i>And so that hopefully
we not stop too much.</i>

22:48.934 --> 22:52.002
We are 18 hours and 44 minutes

22:52.537 --> 22:54.772
from Houston, Texas.

22:54.774 --> 22:56.941
[Sharon] [bleep] We are
so far behind.

23:02.414 --> 23:03.881
- [Ricky] We're driving--
- [Sharon] All day

23:03.883 --> 23:05.082
and we're still in Utah.

23:05.084 --> 23:06.417
[Lacey] Oh, my gosh, what?

23:07.519 --> 23:10.020
Do you know the Pueblo Indians

23:10.022 --> 23:13.491
would make their homes
inside the canyons?

23:13.493 --> 23:15.159
<i>[Sharon] Yes, they will.</i>

23:15.161 --> 23:17.995
<i>[Ricky] And then one day,
they just disappeared.</i>

23:19.064 --> 23:19.597
[Sharon speaking]

23:19.631 --> 23:21.031
Mm.

23:21.466 --> 23:23.167
[Sharon] How the [bleep] do you
guys know that you love each other

23:23.169 --> 23:26.170
when you've only been dating
for not even a full month?

23:26.972 --> 23:28.205
[Ricky speaking]

23:35.414 --> 23:37.148
[Lacey speaking]

23:40.018 --> 23:41.352
[Sharon speaking]

23:43.422 --> 23:44.622
[Lacey] He likes <i>Dragon Ball Z,</i>

23:44.624 --> 23:46.824
and I like anime.

23:46.826 --> 23:49.960
- And y'all telling each other y'all love each other?
- [Lacey] We do.

23:50.662 --> 23:52.696
[Sharon] You can't fully know
what love is yet.

23:52.698 --> 23:54.698
When you have
the connection, Sharon...

23:54.700 --> 23:55.966
When you got the connection,

23:55.968 --> 23:58.068
that's when you know it's real.

23:58.070 --> 23:59.203
But you can't have a love--

23:59.205 --> 24:02.039
[Lacey] Well, we're building
our love everyday of the--

24:02.041 --> 24:04.074
- Every day we work on living, building our love.
- [Ricky] Every day we have

24:04.076 --> 24:06.410
- something new.
- I have... That you know what,

24:06.412 --> 24:07.645
I'll give you that.

24:07.647 --> 24:08.913
But at the same time,

24:08.915 --> 24:12.817
I want you guys to be
aware of the fact that

24:12.819 --> 24:15.786
y'all don't really
even know each other.

24:15.788 --> 24:16.787
[Ricky] I just want,

24:16.789 --> 24:19.723
and this is the honest truth.

24:19.725 --> 24:20.858
I want to spend
the rest of my life with her.

24:20.860 --> 24:22.726
That's what I want.

24:22.728 --> 24:23.794
[Sharon] And you're
my little [bleep] brother.

24:23.796 --> 24:26.797
Who is [bleep] ignorant.

24:26.799 --> 24:29.033
- [Lacey] There's a--
- [Sharon] And very gullible

24:29.035 --> 24:31.268
to a lot of [bleep].

24:31.937 --> 24:33.404
So when I see something,

24:33.839 --> 24:35.039
I'm gonna [bleep] speak on it.

24:35.041 --> 24:36.574
And you already
[bleep] know how I am.

24:36.576 --> 24:38.876
I understand, I respect that.

24:38.878 --> 24:41.412
Thank you, Sharon, for
hanging with us and helping.

24:41.414 --> 24:42.413
I really appreciate it.

24:45.784 --> 24:47.585
I, I need to stop at a drug stop

24:47.587 --> 24:49.119
and get some things.

24:50.922 --> 24:52.223
Yeah the next stop,
I gotta stop.

24:52.624 --> 24:53.591
Oh, God.

24:53.658 --> 24:55.960
[Sharon] I think they have one
like right here.

24:55.962 --> 24:57.428
[Lacey] Yeah, there's
a gas station up there.

24:57.963 --> 24:59.330
Oh, man, I'm getting sick.

25:00.165 --> 25:01.665
[Lacey] I have to go number two.

25:01.667 --> 25:04.969
- [Lacey] Oh, shart...
- [Sharon] What in the [bleep] is wrong with you?

25:04.971 --> 25:07.805
[Lacey] Ooh, I gotta
get out fast, and new pants.

25:07.807 --> 25:08.839
[Ricky] [bleep] yourself.

25:08.841 --> 25:10.074
[Lacey] New pants, new pants.

25:10.076 --> 25:12.009
New pants? Oh, God, no.

25:16.715 --> 25:17.414
[bleep]

25:22.087 --> 25:24.922
She pooped herself and...

25:24.924 --> 25:26.123
she was just taking a fart,

25:26.125 --> 25:28.158
you know,
like anybody does and...

25:28.160 --> 25:29.660
Well, it wasn't a fart.

25:29.662 --> 25:30.961
[Sharon laughing]

25:32.697 --> 25:34.031
- Oh, my God.
- [Ricky] And so...

25:34.033 --> 25:36.000
I think she needs to get off

25:36.434 --> 25:38.102
the fast food
for a little while.

25:38.570 --> 25:40.938
Sharon, it's just, just,
you know, well, you know,

25:40.940 --> 25:43.407
it's a fart. You know, if you
take away the fart it happens.

25:44.676 --> 25:45.743
[Sharon] Really, though?

25:45.745 --> 25:47.778
I told her ass
to go to the bathroom.

25:47.780 --> 25:49.246
So we can get
on the [bleep] road.

25:51.416 --> 25:53.918
This is the most
adventurous trip

25:53.920 --> 25:55.853
that I have ever
gotten volunteered for

25:55.855 --> 25:57.888
in my entire [bleep] life.

25:57.890 --> 25:59.423
Do you think she's fast food...
Eating too much fast food?

25:59.425 --> 26:00.357
Go get Lacey.

26:00.959 --> 26:02.192
Okay.

26:02.194 --> 26:04.128
I'm... I'm trying to get his
[bleep] inside to get your--

26:04.130 --> 26:06.130
<i>[Lacey] I just need Ricky
to bring me a diaper.</i>

26:06.898 --> 26:07.431
Girl,

26:07.933 --> 26:09.166
ooh-wee.

26:10.068 --> 26:12.036
Ooh-[bleep]-wee, girl.

26:13.238 --> 26:14.939
<i>What [bleep]?</i>

26:14.941 --> 26:17.408
I'm not a judgmental person
I don't judge at first,

26:17.410 --> 26:18.742
you know, 'cause I feel

26:18.744 --> 26:19.977
everybody has
their own [bleep] thing.

26:19.979 --> 26:21.745
<i>But [bleep].</i>

26:21.747 --> 26:24.014
<i>Think they like
each other a lot.</i>

26:24.016 --> 26:25.983
You know, I think they do
like each other.

26:26.017 --> 26:27.117
But...

26:29.754 --> 26:30.554
[knocking at door]

26:30.556 --> 26:32.289
I think it's more like...

26:33.091 --> 26:35.359
She needs somebody
to take care of her.

26:35.660 --> 26:37.795
And my brother

26:37.797 --> 26:39.797
just automatically
just jumps in and does it

26:39.799 --> 26:41.131
'cause that's what he does.

26:41.900 --> 26:42.733
[Lacey] Can you help, please?

26:42.735 --> 26:43.667
[Lacey burps]

26:43.669 --> 26:44.935
- [Ricky] Okay?
- [Lacey] I threw up.

26:44.937 --> 26:46.870
[Ricky] Your body said,
"Hey, [bleep]

26:46.872 --> 26:48.205
Give me something healthy."

26:48.740 --> 26:51.709
But I'll stay out of it.
He'll learn.

26:51.711 --> 26:53.043
Everybody's gotta
learn sometime.

27:00.852 --> 27:02.286
[piano music playing]

27:08.560 --> 27:09.860
It's like a hippie store.

27:09.862 --> 27:11.996
- [Sharon] No, it's...
- [Ricky] It's a food store.

27:15.934 --> 27:17.267
[Sharon] Here you go,
you're here.

27:17.769 --> 27:20.204
[Ricky] Oh, my God, babe.

27:20.672 --> 27:23.107
- We did it.
- [Sharon] You're here, girl.

27:23.109 --> 27:25.042
- You know what's coming, baby, come on.
- [Sharon] I drove

27:25.044 --> 27:26.477
thousands of [bleep] miles

27:26.479 --> 27:28.012
to get here, but you're here.

27:28.014 --> 27:31.348
- [Lacey] I am so nervous about seeing Dr. Now.
- [Sharon] Mmm-hmm.

27:32.984 --> 27:34.718
I feel like I'm gonna puke.

27:34.720 --> 27:35.919
Yeah, I'm excited.

27:35.921 --> 27:37.788
Now scream happiness!

27:37.790 --> 27:40.190
- Yes!
- Oh, yeah!

27:40.192 --> 27:42.292
- Finally!
- Finally.

27:42.360 --> 27:46.397
Come on, let's go.

27:46.399 --> 27:51.135
<i>[Lacey] We finally made it to Houston
last night after five days on the road.</i>

27:53.038 --> 27:55.406
<i>Coming down here
is so incredibly hard,</i>

27:55.408 --> 27:59.009
<i>but I did it because I know
how bad I need help.</i>

27:59.011 --> 28:03.947
<i>And Dr. Now is one of the only
people that can do that for me.</i>

28:04.916 --> 28:06.083
Finally.

28:06.217 --> 28:07.084
We made it.

28:07.086 --> 28:08.419
[Ricky] Mmm-hmm.

28:08.421 --> 28:10.287
[Lacey] Oh, my goodness.

28:14.726 --> 28:16.960
Miss Buckingham?

28:19.030 --> 28:19.396
<i>[Lacey] Now that I'm here...</i>

28:19.398 --> 28:20.397
Hi.

28:20.399 --> 28:23.233
<i>I'm nervous about
finding out my weight.</i>

28:26.237 --> 28:30.007
<i>This is gonna be the first time
Ricky's ever seen my weight.</i>

28:31.409 --> 28:33.677
- We're gonna weigh you, okay?
- Okay.

28:33.679 --> 28:35.446
[nurse] Can you go
on the scale now, please?

28:35.448 --> 28:36.747
- [Lacey] Thank you.
- [Nurse] Step up.

28:36.749 --> 28:39.783
<i>[Lacey] If I'm heavier
than 600 pounds or so,</i>

28:39.785 --> 28:41.318
<i>that's gonna be
really upsetting.</i>

28:50.795 --> 28:52.029
I don't know what to say.

28:53.631 --> 28:55.199
You can step down.

28:55.934 --> 28:59.002
<i>[Lacey] That's about
what I expected,</i>

28:59.004 --> 29:01.371
<i>but it's still hard
to see that number.</i>

29:05.643 --> 29:08.312
<i>But I'm glad I wasn't
heavier than I thought.</i>

29:11.282 --> 29:13.417
<i>That's at least positive.</i>

29:13.419 --> 29:16.353
<i>And now, I just hope
I can get the help I need.</i>

29:24.929 --> 29:26.130
[knock at door]

29:29.734 --> 29:30.734
Hello, how you all doing?

29:30.736 --> 29:32.803
Good. How are you?

29:32.805 --> 29:35.939
I'm doing well, too.
Thank you for asking.

29:35.941 --> 29:37.775
- So, you must be Lacey.
- Yes.

29:37.777 --> 29:38.909
[Dr. Now] All right.

29:38.911 --> 29:41.145
So, who is the young man
that came with you?

29:41.147 --> 29:43.247
This is my boyfriend, Ricky.

29:44.048 --> 29:45.048
How nice to meet you.

29:45.050 --> 29:47.417
So, where you coming from?

29:47.419 --> 29:49.753
Southeastern Washington state.

29:49.755 --> 29:52.589
How long it took you to come
from Washington to here?

29:52.591 --> 29:53.924
[Lacey] Five days.

29:53.926 --> 29:56.727
- Five days to get here one way.
- [Lacey] Yeah.

29:56.729 --> 29:59.696
- And five days to go back.
- Yes.

29:59.698 --> 30:03.734
All right, so what seem to be
issue with your eating habit

30:03.736 --> 30:05.669
that you're not able
to lose weight?

30:05.671 --> 30:07.871
Too much carbohydrates.

30:07.873 --> 30:09.840
That's not the problem.
The problem is,

30:09.842 --> 30:12.176
if you know you're eating
too much carbohydrates,

30:12.178 --> 30:14.411
why aren't you doing
something about it?

30:17.649 --> 30:19.082
Um...

30:19.084 --> 30:21.485
I kind of gave up
on myself, I guess.

30:21.487 --> 30:22.686
- Lazy and--
- [Dr. Now] Okay.

30:22.688 --> 30:25.189
- Okay. Lacey, you're 36 years old.
- [Lacey] Yes.

30:25.191 --> 30:27.925
So, do you have
a goal in your life?

30:27.927 --> 30:29.092
Yes, I want to...

30:29.094 --> 30:31.395
Well, I want to lose weight,

30:31.397 --> 30:33.764
and have a happier lifestyle,

30:33.766 --> 30:37.067
and grow in my relationship
with Ricky,

30:37.069 --> 30:39.736
and have a life instead
of being at home, and...

30:39.738 --> 30:44.007
Okay, and so you got the goal
to have... Have productive life.

30:44.009 --> 30:45.409
- Yes.
- [Dr. Now] Okay.

30:45.411 --> 30:46.977
So, the question is

30:46.979 --> 30:48.946
what are you gonna do
to get there?

30:48.948 --> 30:50.380
[Lacey] Anything.

30:50.382 --> 30:53.784
[Dr. Now] Then why haven't you
already tried to do something

30:53.786 --> 30:57.087
if you want a productive life
and to change things?

30:57.089 --> 30:58.789
[Lacey] I've tried, I guess.

30:58.791 --> 31:00.457
I don't know. I just...

31:00.459 --> 31:02.392
[Dr. Now] All right.
Looking at your chart,

31:02.394 --> 31:06.864
- you are taking almost about 30 medications a day.
- [Lacey] Yes.

31:06.866 --> 31:12.736
And you have high blood pressure,
diabetes, asthma, thyroid problem,

31:12.738 --> 31:18.242
and reflux, neuropathy,
lymphedema, migraine,

31:18.244 --> 31:21.578
- and the list goes on and on--
- [Lacey] On and on and on.

31:21.580 --> 31:23.814
[Dr. Now] So, it's clear
that your body

31:23.816 --> 31:26.550
is at a breaking point
because of your weight.

31:26.552 --> 31:28.452
So, you got a lot
of health issue,

31:28.454 --> 31:32.055
and you need to take care
of yourself, right?

31:32.057 --> 31:33.891
- Yes.
- [Dr. Now] And you need to lose weight.

31:33.893 --> 31:34.625
Yes.

31:34.627 --> 31:35.792
All right.

31:35.794 --> 31:39.129
So, if I give you some
instruction about the eating habit,

31:39.131 --> 31:41.265
do you think
you can follow those?

31:41.267 --> 31:42.833
- Yes.
- [Dr. Now] Okay.

31:42.835 --> 31:45.636
So, I'm going to give you some
stuff I want you to read every night,

31:45.638 --> 31:50.407
that will break down at 1,200 calories
a day. Low-carb, high-protein diet,

31:50.409 --> 31:52.376
that you need
to follow completely.

31:52.378 --> 31:55.812
- Okay.
- [Dr. Now] And understand, to correct your eating habit.

31:55.814 --> 31:59.850
And I'm gonna give you some
exercises that you can do at home,

31:59.852 --> 32:02.786
and I want you to do
those twice a day,

32:02.788 --> 32:04.888
once in the morning,
and once in the evening.

32:04.890 --> 32:08.659
So, in two months,
you need to lose 50 pounds.

32:08.661 --> 32:11.161
- That won't be hard to do at all.
- Okay.

32:11.163 --> 32:13.397
But since you live so far,

32:13.399 --> 32:16.767
it'll take you five days to come
here and five days to go back.

32:16.769 --> 32:19.703
That's a ten-day round trip.

32:19.705 --> 32:21.605
- Yeah.
- [Dr. Now] That is a lot of strain on your body.

32:21.607 --> 32:25.776
So, I don't want you making that
trip again to come back down here

32:25.778 --> 32:28.712
before we know you made it
through that goal.

32:28.714 --> 32:30.814
So, we get you to
go see a doctor

32:30.816 --> 32:32.716
and check your weight
in Washington,

32:32.718 --> 32:34.851
and if you made it
through that goal,

32:34.853 --> 32:38.622
then the next step is you need
to move down here to Houston

32:38.624 --> 32:40.290
if you want to do the program.

32:40.292 --> 32:41.825
But if you're not losing weight,

32:41.827 --> 32:45.862
then there's no point in you
going through all that to come back,

32:45.864 --> 32:47.998
since you won't be
doing the program.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.066
You understand that?

32:49.068 --> 32:51.902
- Yes.
- So, this is gonna be all up to you.

32:51.904 --> 32:53.003
You understand that, right?

32:53.005 --> 32:54.738
- Yes, I understand.
- [Dr. Now] Okay.

32:54.740 --> 32:58.809
All right, so I'm gonna bring you some stuff
and I'm gonna explain to you what to do,

32:58.811 --> 33:02.379
and let's see if we can get
you going in the right direction.

33:03.648 --> 33:05.048
All right, I'll bring it to you.

33:05.050 --> 33:06.350
- [Lacey] Thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.

33:10.655 --> 33:13.156
[Ricky speaking]

33:17.028 --> 33:20.030
<i>[Dr. Now] My biggest concern
with Lacey is that she doesn't seem</i>

33:20.032 --> 33:24.835
like she's ready to take
responsibility for herself on any level.

33:24.837 --> 33:25.969
<i>And if that doesn't change,</i>

33:25.971 --> 33:29.106
<i>then she's likely not gonna
make much progress</i>

33:29.108 --> 33:31.341
to effectively turn
her life around.

33:33.344 --> 33:34.544
All right, Lacey.

33:34.546 --> 33:37.514
All right, I got
some stuff for you.

33:37.516 --> 33:41.852
Let me go over it, so we will have
a good idea of what's going on.

33:41.854 --> 33:46.523
I have no doubt that Lacey wants to
change her life and lose the weight.

33:46.525 --> 33:48.792
<i>But my concern is whether or not</i>

33:48.794 --> 33:51.895
<i>she's gonna put in the work
she needs to make that happen.</i>

33:51.897 --> 33:53.930
<i>Because it's not gonna
be easy for her.</i>

33:53.932 --> 33:56.967
She's going to have
to be committed.

33:56.969 --> 33:59.736
<i>But so far,
she hasn't told me anything</i>

33:59.738 --> 34:02.672
to really convince me she is.

34:02.674 --> 34:06.176
And this is the list
of food to avoid.

34:06.178 --> 34:07.110
- Avoid.
- [Dr. Now] Okay?

34:07.112 --> 34:09.413
Now, I'm gonna give you
a copy of my book.

34:09.415 --> 34:12.649
There's recipes in here
for healthy meal options.

34:12.651 --> 34:15.752
So, read that very carefully.

34:15.754 --> 34:21.091
But the important thing in here,
I put a bookmark for you there,

34:21.659 --> 34:24.094
is your exercise, okay?

34:24.762 --> 34:27.831
<i>Ultimately, if Lacey
wants to do this,</i>

34:27.833 --> 34:30.033
<i>she's going to have
to make a lot of changes,</i>

34:30.035 --> 34:32.202
including moving down here.

34:41.579 --> 34:43.747
<i>But all we can do
is give her the tools</i>

34:43.749 --> 34:46.216
<i>to start the process
at this point.</i>

34:48.186 --> 34:51.955
And makes the choices
she needs is up to her.

34:51.957 --> 34:52.989
All right.

34:54.692 --> 34:55.892
Yes.

34:55.894 --> 34:58.428
I'll give you two months and
see how's your weight doing.

34:58.430 --> 35:00.263
- Mmm-hmm.
- If you're able to lose 50 pounds,

35:03.534 --> 35:05.168
- Okay?
- [Lacey] Okay.

35:05.170 --> 35:08.371
All right, so if you need
anything, then give me a call.

35:08.373 --> 35:09.639
Okay.

35:09.641 --> 35:11.942
Otherwise, we'll see how
we're doing in a couple months.

35:11.944 --> 35:14.077
- Okay?
- [Lacey] It was nice to meet you, sir.

35:14.079 --> 35:16.613
Nice to meet you both.
Have a safe trip back.

35:16.615 --> 35:18.048
[Lacey] Thank you.

35:18.050 --> 35:20.417
- All right, I'll see you all later.
- [Lacey] See you later.

35:20.419 --> 35:23.019
- Okay. Bye now.
- [Lacey] Bye.

35:27.825 --> 35:29.926
- I'm optimistic about moving down here.
- Yep.

35:29.928 --> 35:32.696
With all the humidity
and everything.

35:32.698 --> 35:34.865
Well, and the big bugs.
Oh, my God.

35:34.867 --> 35:37.000
- Big bugs.
- And the big bugs!

35:37.869 --> 35:39.269
My big bug. [laughs]

35:40.538 --> 35:42.806
<i>I think that went well.</i>

35:42.808 --> 35:46.409
<i>That appointment was
extremely eye-opening for me.</i>

35:47.979 --> 35:50.847
<i>And I realize
how bad of a fool I am</i>

35:50.849 --> 35:53.283
<i>because of all that food
I was eating.</i>

35:54.585 --> 35:56.786
It's gonna be very hard.

35:56.788 --> 35:58.755
<i>It's gonna be a struggle,
but I'm ready.</i>

35:58.757 --> 35:59.890
<i>Each day's a new step.</i>

35:59.892 --> 36:02.159
<i>Each day's a new day.</i>

36:02.593 --> 36:05.862
<i>So I feel confident
and ready to do this.</i>

36:05.864 --> 36:09.833
<i>I have to change my life,
no matter how hard it will be,</i>

36:09.835 --> 36:13.036
<i>because I want
a life with Ricky,</i>

36:13.038 --> 36:15.038
<i>and I want to do so much,</i>

36:15.773 --> 36:17.874
<i>and I'm tired of waiting for it.</i>

36:17.876 --> 36:20.010
<i>I'm ready for change.</i>

36:20.845 --> 36:22.412
<i>I'm ready to do this.</i>

36:22.414 --> 36:23.880
- [Sharon] Hi!
- [Lacey and Ricky] Hi!

36:23.882 --> 36:25.949
[Sharon] How was
your doctor's appointment?

36:25.951 --> 36:27.784
- [Lacey] It was great.
- [Sharon] Was it?

36:27.786 --> 36:28.952
[Lacey] Fantastic.

36:52.210 --> 36:53.843
[Ricky] So... [sighs]

36:53.845 --> 36:57.647
Are you ready for your
adventure at the park?

36:57.649 --> 37:00.250
Well, we're gonna walk
at least about halfway.

37:02.453 --> 37:05.021
Do you want me
to kick you now, or...

37:05.023 --> 37:06.523
- Oh, come on, you can make--
- [Lacey] I'm gonna--

37:06.525 --> 37:08.091
I'm gonna kick you.

37:08.093 --> 37:09.626
- And it's gonna be fun for me.
- [Ricky] You'd be so beautiful,

37:09.628 --> 37:14.030
your body's like, "Ooh, girl, y'all
getting some physical out of me, huh."

37:14.032 --> 37:17.701
<i>[Lacey] We've been back up in
Washington from our Dr. Now appointment</i>

37:17.703 --> 37:19.436
<i>for about a month.</i>

37:21.405 --> 37:24.975
<i>I'm still eating some carbs,
but it's very exciting,</i>

37:24.977 --> 37:28.411
<i>because I'm engaged to Ricky.</i>

37:28.413 --> 37:31.181
Ricky just asked me to
marry him, and I said yes!

37:31.549 --> 37:33.950
<i>It happened really fast.
I was excited.</i>

37:34.919 --> 37:37.621
<i>Me and Ricky had been talking
about getting married,</i>

37:37.623 --> 37:40.290
and Ricky surprised me
with a ring,

37:42.627 --> 37:45.996
and I said yes, and I
surprised him with a ring back!

37:47.465 --> 37:49.933
<i>All my friends
like Ricky, and...</i>

37:49.935 --> 37:53.203
<i>Even my parents like him,
so that was a "bingo" for me!</i>

37:54.205 --> 37:56.706
I wanted her ring
to be personal.

37:56.708 --> 37:59.809
<i>I sneakily asked her, like,
questions about her ring, you know,</i>

37:59.811 --> 38:01.978
<i>what things she wanted,
you know,</i>

38:01.980 --> 38:03.813
<i>without her knowingly
knowing I was doing it,</i>

38:03.815 --> 38:06.082
so I was kind of being,
like, covert.

38:06.984 --> 38:10.020
<i>And I know it sounds stupid,
but I was like,</i>

38:10.022 --> 38:12.956
<i>"Are you flashy
or are you personal?"</i>

38:12.958 --> 38:16.293
<i>And of course she wanted
personal, so, "Boom!" I went and got it,</i>

38:16.295 --> 38:18.528
<i>and paid for it.</i>

38:18.530 --> 38:20.597
She didn't... You know, she was
thinking, "What are you buying?"

38:20.599 --> 38:23.833
And I'm like, "Nevermind,"
until we got to the mall.

38:23.835 --> 38:26.603
<i>And I was like, "Hey..."
I got on one knee,</i>

38:26.605 --> 38:27.637
<i>everybody started
looking around and all,</i>

38:27.639 --> 38:29.939
<i>and everybody's all, you know...</i>

38:29.941 --> 38:33.310
And I asked her to... "Would
you marry me?" She's like, "Yes!"

38:37.548 --> 38:38.381
[Lacey] Some water.

38:41.686 --> 38:42.786
[Ricky] I'm very proud
of you, baby.

38:42.788 --> 38:44.320
- [Lacey] Thank you, baby.
- You're doing a good job.

38:52.763 --> 38:55.999
Baby, will you please go sit down,
so you're not interfering in my kitchen?

38:56.901 --> 38:59.169
[Lacey] Just don't cut
your finger off.

38:59.171 --> 39:01.171
[Ricky] Oh, come on,
I've been cooking for years.

39:02.406 --> 39:05.108
<i>[Lacey] Every day,
I'm reading Dr. Now's book,</i>

39:05.110 --> 39:07.744
<i>trying to do what the diet says.</i>

39:07.746 --> 39:09.779
[Ricky] Hey, babe?

39:09.781 --> 39:13.783
I got these flour tortillas,
and they're low... They're, uh...

39:13.785 --> 39:17.220
Trans fat... Zero trans fat
and zero calorie.

39:17.222 --> 39:19.889
[Lacey] Well, how much carbs
is in one tortilla?

39:19.957 --> 39:21.624
33.

39:21.626 --> 39:22.792
[laughing] Oh, that's
a lot, honey!

39:22.794 --> 39:23.760
- [Ricky] Is it a lot? Oh.
- Yeah.

39:23.762 --> 39:24.761
[Ricky] I thought that was low.

39:24.763 --> 39:27.430
You can...
You can eat that, though.

39:27.432 --> 39:28.698
So, you just want...
You just want a plate of--

39:28.700 --> 39:30.734
A plate of the vegetables
and the meat part.

39:30.736 --> 39:33.303
Here you go. And then you
can just put it with your salad.

39:34.505 --> 39:37.374
- Okay, I'm doing the salad right now.
- [Ricky] Okay.

39:37.376 --> 39:41.611
<i>[Lacey] What's more satisfying
about the diet is that it is healthier.</i>

39:41.613 --> 39:46.716
<i>I'm going slowly, cutting
out certain carbs each day.</i>

39:46.718 --> 39:48.885
<i>I feel like I can eat
more vegetables with it,</i>

39:48.887 --> 39:52.655
<i>like lettuce
with lots of tomatoes.</i>

39:52.657 --> 39:54.124
<i>But it's still a process.</i>

39:54.126 --> 39:56.292
<i>This is a whole lifestyle,</i>

39:56.294 --> 40:00.029
<i>it's not just temporary, 'cause after
the surgery, it's a whole new life.</i>

40:00.664 --> 40:01.731
Well, the dinner was good,
thank you.

40:01.733 --> 40:03.967
[Ricky] You're welcome, babe.

40:03.969 --> 40:06.302
<i>[Lacey] Ricky's helping me
keep my spirits up.</i>

40:06.304 --> 40:07.871
<i>I'm very happy.</i>

40:07.938 --> 40:11.808
<i>And I know that there's an increase
with our love for each other, too.</i>

40:11.810 --> 40:15.779
<i>But the only thing that's
bothering me is Sharon.</i>

40:15.781 --> 40:19.416
<i>She's clearly against
me and Ricky being together.</i>

40:20.017 --> 40:22.452
[Ricky] So, babe,
let's talk about my sister.

40:22.454 --> 40:25.722
I know we...
I know she has issues.

40:25.724 --> 40:27.657
- The queen of drama, see what I'm saying?
- Yeah.

40:27.659 --> 40:31.828
She's my sister. I love her,
but I'm at your side 100%.

40:31.830 --> 40:35.865
And I know you're doing your
exercises, you're losing weight,

40:35.867 --> 40:39.269
so I'm pretty sure you're
doing what the doctor says.

40:39.271 --> 40:42.172
I want this to be
a easy transition.

40:42.406 --> 40:43.373
Yeah.

40:44.909 --> 40:47.277
Gotta set up the TV
to do the workout.

40:47.645 --> 40:49.078
Here, give me that.

40:51.415 --> 40:53.450
<i>Whether or not
Sharon supports us,</i>

40:55.152 --> 40:58.421
<i>we love each other and want
to spend our lives together.</i>

40:58.956 --> 41:00.123
Okay, ready?

41:00.558 --> 41:02.058
One. Oh, belly kick up.

41:02.060 --> 41:05.428
<i>[Lacey] And Ricky's been
helping me do my exercises.</i>

41:05.430 --> 41:07.397
<i>And I'm thankful
because I don't think</i>

41:07.399 --> 41:09.933
<i>I'd be able to do much on my own</i>

41:09.935 --> 41:10.867
<i>without his help.</i>

41:10.934 --> 41:13.570
<i>So it makes me feel very loved</i>

41:13.572 --> 41:17.474
<i>and cared for when he
supports me like this.</i>

41:17.476 --> 41:21.077
<i>So, it's been a big change for
both of us and our relationship,</i>

41:21.079 --> 41:24.080
<i>but we're doing it
because we both know</i>

41:24.082 --> 41:26.115
<i>how important it is for me.</i>

41:26.650 --> 41:28.384
<i>It's just hard.</i>

41:28.386 --> 41:32.155
<i>But I'm gonna stick to it
no matter how hard it is.</i>

41:40.064 --> 41:43.166
[breathlessly] I'm gonna take a
break. I'm gonna take a break.

41:43.801 --> 41:45.235
Good job, babe.

41:55.813 --> 41:57.313
[FaceTime dialing]

42:01.418 --> 42:03.486
<i>- Hi, Lacey, how you doing?
- I'm doing pretty good.</i>

42:03.488 --> 42:04.921
<i>Okay, good.</i>

42:04.923 --> 42:08.491
<i>Lacey, I was worried because,
you know, it's been three months</i>

42:08.493 --> 42:11.928
<i>since you were supposed to
follow up with us.</i>

42:11.930 --> 42:15.398
<i>And I haven't heard from you, so
checking to see what's going on.</i>

42:15.400 --> 42:16.966
Um...

42:16.968 --> 42:21.437
Well, definitely, I'm taking
way much better care

42:21.439 --> 42:23.006
of my health than I was before.

42:23.008 --> 42:25.141
<i>So how are you doing
with your eating habits?</i>

42:25.143 --> 42:26.709
<i>Do you think you lost
any weight?</i>

42:26.711 --> 42:28.845
Yes, I'm sure I have.

42:28.847 --> 42:34.217
<i>Okay, so why haven't you
contacted us if you're doing so well?</i>

42:34.652 --> 42:36.486
Well, there's been
a lot of changes.

42:36.488 --> 42:39.589
A lot of great stuff's
been happening. I got engaged.

42:39.591 --> 42:41.524
And me and Ricky have been
working on moving down to Houston.

42:41.526 --> 42:44.694
<i>Well, congratulations
on your engagement.</i>

42:44.696 --> 42:48.631
<i>- It sounds like a lot is going on in your life.
- Yes.</i>

42:48.633 --> 42:51.768
<i>But if you're not making
your health a priority,</i>

42:51.770 --> 42:54.704
<i>then nothing else is going
to matter for you, okay?</i>

42:54.706 --> 42:59.008
- Yes.
<i>- Then why taking you so long to get back with us?</i>

42:59.577 --> 43:02.545
Um, well, I have to...

43:02.547 --> 43:05.782
I do have some issues
to deal with.

43:05.784 --> 43:09.419
And I had to, like, prepare
mentally and physically

43:09.421 --> 43:12.388
to, like, move
before I move down there.

43:12.390 --> 43:15.625
<i>Well, Lacey, if you
haven't lost any weight</i>

43:15.627 --> 43:17.560
<i>then there's no point
to move to Houston</i>

43:17.562 --> 43:19.862
<i>because I'm not going
to go ahead with you.</i>

43:19.864 --> 43:24.033
<i>So we have to check your weight
to see that before you move here.</i>

43:24.035 --> 43:25.435
<i>Do you understand that?</i>

43:25.437 --> 43:26.569
I understand completely.

43:26.571 --> 43:29.505
<i>You should have easily lost
over 100 pounds.</i>

43:29.507 --> 43:33.843
<i>But I'm not sure about that
from how you look right now.</i>

43:33.845 --> 43:36.212
<i>- Well, check you're weight, and we'll go from here, okay?
- Okay.</i>

43:36.214 --> 43:37.914
Sounds great!

43:37.916 --> 43:41.050
<i>All right, and if you need anything
in the meantime, give me a call.</i>

43:41.052 --> 43:43.920
Okay, I will.
Thank you so much.

43:43.922 --> 43:46.889
<i>- All right, take care.
- Take care. Thank you.</i>

43:46.891 --> 43:49.359
<i>- All right, bye now.
- Bye.</i>

43:51.462 --> 43:52.662
[Lacey]
<i>I'm a little disappointed</i>

43:52.664 --> 43:55.531
<i>because Dr. Now
didn't react like I thought</i>

43:55.533 --> 43:58.401
<i>to how we're ready
and committed to move.</i>

43:58.403 --> 44:01.738
<i>Me and Ricky have put in a
lot of work to make that happen.</i>

44:01.740 --> 44:03.573
<i>And I think it shows the level
of commitment I have</i>

44:03.575 --> 44:08.578
<i>since I'm ready to just leave everything
behind here to start again there.</i>

44:08.580 --> 44:14.317
<i>And I think Dr. Now will understand
once I'm there and sees how far I've come.</i>

44:14.718 --> 44:19.822
<i>The plan is to move next week,
keep working just as hard,</i>

44:19.824 --> 44:23.159
<i>get weight loss surgery,
and start a new life with Ricky.</i>

44:25.529 --> 44:26.863
<i>Everything's ready.</i>

44:26.865 --> 44:29.365
<i>It's everything
I've ever dreamed of.</i>

44:30.401 --> 44:33.236
<i>And I can't wait for it,
so I'm not.</i>

44:41.879 --> 44:43.112
[piano music playing]

44:54.391 --> 44:56.259
The apartment emailed me back.

44:56.927 --> 44:58.127
Hmm.

45:00.030 --> 45:01.798
Approved! Approved!

45:01.800 --> 45:04.901
No, no, no. We don't know yet.

45:04.903 --> 45:07.637
<i>[Lacey] Me and Ricky have
been busy getting everything set</i>

45:07.639 --> 45:08.604
<i>for our move to Houston.</i>

45:08.606 --> 45:11.641
<i>And we're also planning
a small wedding.</i>

45:11.643 --> 45:14.844
<i>But we decided I need to be focused
on doing the program right now.</i>

45:14.846 --> 45:16.646
<i>So we've got everything
lined up,</i>

45:16.648 --> 45:20.550
<i>and we plan on moving
to Houston next week.</i>

45:20.552 --> 45:24.520
It says we've received the following
payment. But all of them say that.

45:24.522 --> 45:26.789
<i>So that should make
Dr. Now happy when I tell him</i>

45:26.791 --> 45:30.026
<i>because I'm 100% committed
to this new life</i>

45:30.028 --> 45:32.328
<i>in doing whatever it takes
to make it happen.</i>

45:37.367 --> 45:38.434
[sighs]

45:39.403 --> 45:45.074
We better go and walk
before I can take a break.

45:45.076 --> 45:47.844
<i>[Lacey] At the hospital the other
day I just went in there to get weighed.</i>

45:47.846 --> 45:50.947
<i>I weighed 577.</i>

45:50.949 --> 45:54.884
<i>I lost 16 pounds,
and he wanted me to lose 50.</i>

45:54.886 --> 45:56.552
<i>So I have a lot of progress
to make.</i>

45:56.554 --> 45:59.155
<i>I've had a bumpy ride
trying to lose weight.</i>

45:59.157 --> 46:02.191
<i>But me and Ricky
want to move to Houston.</i>

46:02.193 --> 46:04.193
<i>And I don't need
to wait any longer.</i>

46:06.096 --> 46:07.230
Ricky?

46:08.031 --> 46:09.165
[grunts]

46:14.538 --> 46:15.938
Let's go.

46:16.940 --> 46:19.642
<i>I think I can be
very successful.</i>

46:19.644 --> 46:21.544
I'm not eating
as much pizza as I did.

46:21.546 --> 46:24.514
<i>I have been exercising,
and I have been walking.</i>

46:24.516 --> 46:27.416
- Do you want to hold my arm?
- Thank you.

46:27.418 --> 46:31.921
<i>Ricky has been going with me,
so we can get exercising.</i>

46:31.923 --> 46:33.890
<i>I circled the complex twice,
not just once.</i>

46:33.892 --> 46:37.326
So making little baby progress.

46:37.328 --> 46:40.096
Oh, my gosh.
I'm so sick to my stomach.

46:40.098 --> 46:41.497
- Well, sit down, baby.
- I want to sit down in the shade.

46:41.499 --> 46:43.432
Sit right there.

46:43.434 --> 46:46.636
<i>[Lacey] It's been very
stressful this past month.</i>

46:46.638 --> 46:49.071
<i>A lot of stress trying to find
somewhere to live in Houston.</i>

46:49.073 --> 46:51.974
And I'm really gonna miss
Ricky's family.

46:51.976 --> 46:53.609
They accepted me so fast.

46:53.611 --> 46:57.780
And his mother
is very kind to me.

46:57.782 --> 47:00.416
<i>Uh, my relationship
with Sharon's gotten better.</i>

47:00.418 --> 47:01.918
<i>Things have been very good.</i>

47:01.920 --> 47:04.687
<i>And it feels
like she's accepted me</i>

47:04.689 --> 47:06.055
<i>a little bit better than before.</i>

47:06.057 --> 47:08.825
<i>And I really enjoy
spending time with her.</i>

47:08.827 --> 47:11.160
Okay, come on, babe.

47:12.029 --> 47:13.196
[Lacey] Team Lacey.

47:13.198 --> 47:16.432
[Ricky] Team Lacey!

47:16.434 --> 47:20.937
<i>[Lacey] So here soon, me and Ricky
will be married and living in Houston.</i>

47:20.939 --> 47:23.306
<i>And I'll hopefully be getting
weight loss surgery, too.</i>

47:23.308 --> 47:24.673
[Lacey breathing heavily]

47:24.675 --> 47:27.543
<i>I'm ready to leave the old
behind and start with the new.</i>

47:27.545 --> 47:29.612
[Ricky] Okay,
I'll get the door, babe.

47:29.614 --> 47:33.649
<i>[Lacey] So I have so many
things to look forward to right now.</i>

47:33.651 --> 47:35.985
<i>I just have to
keep working hard.</i>

47:35.987 --> 47:38.187
<i>And that's exactly
what I'm gonna do.</i>

47:41.291 --> 47:42.325
[Lacey grunts]

47:46.029 --> 47:48.197
See we made it.

47:48.565 --> 47:51.100
- Thanks, baby.
- Thanks, baby.

48:00.043 --> 48:02.645
One more box. Well, we
can put that box right there.

48:02.647 --> 48:04.914
Outside. Right there.

48:04.916 --> 48:09.085
<i>[Lacey] Me and Ricky are packing
everything up to move to Houston.</i>

48:09.087 --> 48:10.386
<i>He got his stuff loaded
in the trailer...</i>

48:10.388 --> 48:11.320
I got it.

48:11.322 --> 48:13.623
<i>And now, we're loading
all my stuff up</i>

48:13.625 --> 48:16.392
<i>with the help of some of
my friends from my church.</i>

48:16.394 --> 48:21.764
<i>A lot of them like Renee and
Gloria have been there for me</i>

48:21.766 --> 48:23.666
<i>even when it got to where
I couldn't go to church.</i>

48:23.668 --> 48:26.702
- Watch your feet.
- Yep.

48:26.704 --> 48:30.706
<i>Hopefully, having all this help
will get us on the road soon.</i>

48:30.708 --> 48:33.910
[Ricky] All right,
come the hard part.

48:33.912 --> 48:37.280
Let's get this going. I'm not trying
to have these do to us all day.

48:37.282 --> 48:38.881
[woman] I'll go with everybody.

48:38.883 --> 48:42.985
<i>[Lacey] I'm hoping we can finish
getting everything out of here</i>

48:42.987 --> 48:46.989
<i>and get on the road soon because
I don't want to be traveling too late.</i>

48:47.457 --> 48:48.925
[man] What else needs to go out?

48:48.927 --> 48:52.161
Um, this couch. Let me get
off. Let me get off the couch.

48:53.797 --> 48:55.464
I know. You don't
have time for hugs.

48:55.466 --> 48:56.832
Oh, we do, babe. Oh, we do.

48:56.834 --> 48:59.835
<i>[Lacey] What I don't take
the church is gonna donate.</i>

48:59.837 --> 49:03.873
<i>So all I have to do
is get my final stuff loaded,</i>

49:03.875 --> 49:06.075
<i>and then I'll officially
be moved out.</i>

49:06.410 --> 49:07.910
- [Sharon] Lacey!
- Yeah.

49:07.912 --> 49:09.045
She needs to get up and help.

49:09.047 --> 49:10.780
I've been helping.

49:10.782 --> 49:11.647
Okay, I'm glad.

49:11.649 --> 49:13.416
I helped pack all night.

49:13.418 --> 49:16.218
[Sharon] It was just more of a
question. It came out kinda wrong.

49:16.220 --> 49:19.088
[Sharon] I'm a mean [beep],
am I?

49:19.856 --> 49:20.790
[Lacey grunts]

49:20.792 --> 49:24.393
- Okay, hey, baby, right here.
- Thank you.

49:24.395 --> 49:25.895
- Take this.
- Team work. Team work, baby. Team work.

49:25.897 --> 49:27.163
Yep.

49:28.031 --> 49:29.799
[woman] I'm trying not to cry.

49:29.801 --> 49:30.666
Take care of each other, bro.

49:30.668 --> 49:33.202
- I will.
- Be good, girl.

49:33.204 --> 49:36.238
- [man] Yep, be safe.
- [Lacey] Yep.

49:37.407 --> 49:38.908
<i>[man] Hastas.</i>

49:38.910 --> 49:40.576
- Bye, Ricky.
- Bye.

49:40.578 --> 49:42.111
Oh, no!

49:42.113 --> 49:44.180
I can't believe
you're leaving, Lacey.

49:45.315 --> 49:48.651
Ah! Dang, you're strong.

49:48.653 --> 49:50.453
<i>[Lacey] I thought it'd be sad
to see this place emptied out.</i>

49:50.455 --> 49:53.255
<i>It's been my home for years.</i>

49:53.257 --> 49:58.961
<i>I'm actually excited to see it like this
because it means I'm leaving a life behind</i>

49:58.963 --> 50:03.599
<i>that I don't want any more, so I
can start the one that I do want.</i>

50:03.601 --> 50:05.768
- Tapped it out.
- Oh! [laughs]

50:05.770 --> 50:07.103
Broke it in, yeah.
We broke it in.

50:07.105 --> 50:09.638
Look at the area of the bed.

50:09.640 --> 50:11.207
Yeah, it's like imprinted.

50:11.209 --> 50:12.708
<i>[Lacey] So it's all exciting.</i>

50:12.710 --> 50:17.213
<i>And as hard as it is, I'm happy
to have the chance to do this</i>

50:17.215 --> 50:19.348
<i>and to be doing it with Ricky.</i>

50:21.284 --> 50:22.418
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

50:22.420 --> 50:25.388
<i>[Lacey] He's been my rock
through this.</i>

50:25.390 --> 50:30.292
<i>And I know I wouldn't even have this
chance without his support and love.</i>

50:30.294 --> 50:33.596
<i>So I'm very thankful for all
the people I have in my life</i>

50:33.598 --> 50:37.867
<i>who are here for me right now,
supporting me and helping me do this.</i>

50:37.869 --> 50:42.204
<i>It all means the world to me because
it's giving me a second chance at life.</i>

50:47.944 --> 50:50.546
[Sharon] I really didn't think
Idaho was this big,

50:50.548 --> 50:52.648
like, to get across
[bleep] like this.

50:52.650 --> 50:54.050
I didn't think it was supposed
get this long--

50:54.052 --> 50:54.850
[Ricky] Yeah, when we go across

50:54.852 --> 50:56.719
is the really small part of it.

50:56.721 --> 50:59.188
We never really
go through the big part.

50:59.856 --> 51:02.925
[Sharon] So are we closer
to Colorado?

51:02.927 --> 51:07.963
We're actually closer
to Wyoming than we are Utah.

51:07.965 --> 51:09.298
[Sharon] Okay.

51:12.469 --> 51:13.702
[phone ringing]

51:14.037 --> 51:16.806
- Who you calling, babe?
- I'm not calling nobody. It's you.

51:16.808 --> 51:17.973
Hello.

51:20.410 --> 51:22.845
Thank you. Sweet!

51:22.847 --> 51:24.880
- Huh?
- We got approved for an apartment.

51:24.882 --> 51:26.816
Yeah!

51:26.818 --> 51:28.250
All right!

51:28.985 --> 51:30.920
When are we going to be
in Houston?

51:30.922 --> 51:33.889
- The 12th.
- The 12th.

51:33.891 --> 51:36.959
We can, I mean the 13th, if we
have to spend a night in a hotel,

51:36.961 --> 51:37.827
I mean, that's, we'll get on it.

51:37.829 --> 51:39.562
[Ricky] Okay, bye.

51:39.596 --> 51:42.898
[Ricky] Congratulations!
We've got a place!

51:42.900 --> 51:44.667
- [Ricky] Told you.
- [Lacey] We did it! We did it!

51:44.669 --> 51:48.571
I have a meeting
with Dr. Now on the 13th.

51:48.573 --> 51:51.140
- [Ricky] 13th, 13th.
- [Lacey] After I sign the lease.

51:52.008 --> 51:53.509
[Sharon] And today's
the 9th, right?

51:53.511 --> 51:55.411
[Ricky] Is not.

51:55.413 --> 51:56.846
[Sharon] Okay, so we should,
we'll have no problem.

51:56.848 --> 52:00.850
[Ricky] 13th is...
That's in four days!

52:00.852 --> 52:02.518
[Sharon] You know,
I'll even be generous.

52:02.520 --> 52:04.720
We'll let it take three days
to get to Texas.

52:04.722 --> 52:08.190
And then, I'm dropping
that trailer, and...

52:08.192 --> 52:10.626
- [Ricky] Dipping.
- [Sharon] Dipping the [bleep] out.

52:10.628 --> 52:12.328
[Sharon laughs]

52:19.402 --> 52:20.936
[Sharon] They only give you
one [bleep] cracker?

52:20.938 --> 52:23.806
- [Ricky] They didn't have any chili Fritos?
- [bleeping]

52:23.808 --> 52:28.277
And they only gave her one
cracker to go in her [bleep] chili.

52:28.279 --> 52:30.813
- [sighing] It's okay.
- I'm really, really missing

52:30.815 --> 52:32.615
chili, with a lot of onions.

52:32.617 --> 52:34.283
I've loved chili since
I was little.

52:34.285 --> 52:36.685
[Sharon] Yeah, what are you
going to tell this doctor, man?

52:36.687 --> 52:39.922
What if this doctor says, "You
know what, I'm not [bleep] around.

52:39.924 --> 52:41.757
You're [bleep] going to taking
this [bleep] serious."

52:41.759 --> 52:43.559
What happens after that?

52:43.561 --> 52:44.693
Have you ever thought about
that [bleep]?

52:44.695 --> 52:46.896
- We talked about it.
- Talked about what?

52:46.898 --> 52:49.098
- I already talked about it.
- Oh, my [bleep].

52:49.100 --> 52:50.499
What the [bleep]
is wrong with you?

52:50.501 --> 52:52.835
Sometimes you just so ugly.

52:52.837 --> 52:57.673
Not personally. Just not looks-wise,
but your [bleep] personality.

52:57.675 --> 52:59.575
It's just ugly sometimes.

52:59.577 --> 53:01.043
- I don't get you.
- No comment.

53:01.045 --> 53:02.511
[Sharon] Good. Don't comment.
I don't even care.

53:02.513 --> 53:05.080
I need a little minute
to myself.

53:05.082 --> 53:07.850
Man, grow the [bleep] up. You're 36
years old and you're [bleep] just crazy.

53:07.852 --> 53:09.852
- Sharon, can you grow up and stop picking on me?
- I am [bleep] very grown.

53:09.854 --> 53:11.587
Stop picking on me all the time.

53:11.589 --> 53:13.689
- I ain't picking on you!
- But you're not perfect, either!

53:13.691 --> 53:15.891
[bleep] I ain't perfect!
I never said I was perfect!

53:15.893 --> 53:17.259
Not one time did I say
I was perfect!

53:17.261 --> 53:18.661
You call me fat.

53:18.663 --> 53:19.895
- You are! So am I!
- You are too!

53:19.897 --> 53:22.531
- I never said I wasn't!
- Oh, okay.

53:22.533 --> 53:24.900
[Sharon] I'm asking you
real questions.

53:24.902 --> 53:27.670
My brother is gonna be
down there with you.

53:27.672 --> 53:30.773
I am so tired, Sharon.

53:30.775 --> 53:32.641
You're tired? All you [bleep]
do is sit there!

53:32.643 --> 53:34.677
I've been doing all the work!

53:34.679 --> 53:36.178
You ain't done [bleep]
besides eat and cry.

53:36.180 --> 53:38.180
- Okay.
- Eat and cry. Eat and cry.

53:38.248 --> 53:39.648
Eat and cry.

53:39.683 --> 53:42.551
[bleeping]

53:42.553 --> 53:46.021
- Woman, I'm about to drop your [bleep] off.
- Sure ain't crying right now.

53:46.023 --> 53:48.357
And flip a [bleep] and go right
[bleep] home and I'd give two [bleep].

53:48.359 --> 53:51.126
Let's get [bleep] on the road.

53:53.997 --> 53:56.131
- I'm warning you. I'm not going to [bleep]...
- [Lacey] I didn't cry.

53:56.133 --> 53:58.434
- Deal with you much longer.
- [Lacey] Okay.

54:04.774 --> 54:06.275
[Sharon] Texas!

54:06.876 --> 54:09.945
My allergies do not
like New Mexico.

54:11.615 --> 54:14.416
<i>[Lacey] So, we almost
made it to Texas.</i>

54:14.418 --> 54:16.986
<i>We're still a good ways
from Houston.</i>

54:16.988 --> 54:18.887
<i>Like, about 11 hours.</i>

54:18.889 --> 54:22.291
<i>So we're definitely not
making it to Dr. Now on time.</i>

54:23.727 --> 54:26.028
We're not gonna make it.

54:26.896 --> 54:30.366
My appointment with Dr. Now
is scheduled for this evening.

54:30.368 --> 54:31.700
[Sharon] Well, then,
don't you think you should

54:31.702 --> 54:33.736
get on the phone and tell them
you ain't making it tonight?

54:33.738 --> 54:35.971
[Lacey] The first time I
missed an appointment,

54:35.973 --> 54:40.409
I called them right away
and told them what happened.

54:41.111 --> 54:42.911
He understood.

54:42.913 --> 54:45.281
[Sharon] This is your second
time missing this appointment?

54:45.749 --> 54:47.416
What was the first time?

54:47.418 --> 54:49.151
[Lacey] The first time was...

54:51.488 --> 54:52.754
June.

54:52.756 --> 54:56.191
[Sharon] Oh. Why did you miss
this first appointment in June?

55:02.132 --> 55:05.034
Missed the first appointment
in June because...

55:08.171 --> 55:11.940
We... Um, couldn't get,

55:11.942 --> 55:13.409
couldn't get, uh...

55:14.411 --> 55:15.911
You know, like...

55:15.913 --> 55:19.982
Couldn't get there on... I think it was
because we couldn't get there on a...

55:21.985 --> 55:24.320
Financially afford the
plane tickets or something.

55:24.554 --> 55:25.721
I don't remember.

55:25.788 --> 55:28.691
[Sharon] Plane tickets are
hella [bleep] cheap right now.

55:28.693 --> 55:32.394
You mean to tell me you were
supposed to go see the doctor then?

55:32.396 --> 55:35.497
You are just [bleep] around.
You know what? This is just...

55:35.499 --> 55:40.035
Every, all the information I
get, and everything that I hear

55:40.037 --> 55:43.305
just pisses me the [bleep] off,
Lacey. Because you are such...

55:44.974 --> 55:46.342
Ugh!

55:47.544 --> 55:49.478
<i>This [bleep] is lying!</i>

55:49.480 --> 55:52.748
This is the second appointment
she missed?

55:52.750 --> 55:55.651
<i>I just found this out.
I've been helping her out.</i>

55:55.653 --> 55:58.821
<i>Helping her sell old things.
Helping her get money.</i>

55:58.823 --> 56:01.423
Air tickets are [bleep] cheap
as [bleep] right now.

56:01.425 --> 56:03.559
<i>Cheap as [bleep].</i>

56:03.561 --> 56:06.562
<i>Every day this week, this [bleep] has
done [bleep] to piss me the [bleep] off.</i>

56:06.564 --> 56:09.732
<i>If she lies one more time, I swear
to God I'm going to karate chop her.</i>

56:09.734 --> 56:11.967
I don't even want to drive
y'all down there no more.

56:11.969 --> 56:15.838
Y'all could have been down
there a long time ago.

56:15.840 --> 56:18.607
"Oh, we can't do it
'cause of this."

56:18.609 --> 56:20.709
No, you know what?
You could have did it.

56:20.711 --> 56:21.844
You could have gotten off
your big [bleep]

56:21.846 --> 56:24.446
and you could have
[bleep] did it.

56:28.151 --> 56:29.752
[Ricky] Baby, [bleep] out
here. If you're lying,

56:29.754 --> 56:32.254
- y'all need to tell me where's you didn't have...
- [Sharon] Ricky!

56:32.256 --> 56:33.756
The money. You kept
telling me you didn't...

56:33.758 --> 56:35.758
[Sharon] She's lying! She's
lying! She had the money.

56:35.760 --> 56:36.658
[Lacey] I did not have
the money.

56:36.660 --> 56:37.926
You know how much
an air ticket would cost?

56:37.928 --> 56:40.429
- You know how much a [bleep] train ticket would cost?
- Babe.

56:40.431 --> 56:44.032
I know it's, I know is, it
sound like, like...

56:44.034 --> 56:46.769
- Why you telling that it's-- -
[Lacey] But I did not have the money...

56:46.771 --> 56:51.740
- [Sharon] You're lying!
- For a $1,600 air flights for us, round trip.

56:51.742 --> 56:54.576
[Sharon] All that money you
were spending on shopping,

56:54.578 --> 56:57.112
your [bleep] could have been
down in Houston.

56:57.981 --> 57:00.916
You are not ready
to lose weight.

57:00.918 --> 57:03.652
You have stopped my life

57:03.654 --> 57:06.789
and I have way more important
[bleep] things to worry about.

57:06.791 --> 57:09.958
And I'm taking my stupid,
pathetic [bleep] brother

57:09.960 --> 57:13.796
who [bleep] loves your [bleep]
for whatever [bleep] reason.

57:13.798 --> 57:15.664
'Cause all you do is use him.

57:15.666 --> 57:17.299
- No, I don't.
- [Sharon] Please tell me.

57:17.301 --> 57:19.201
What the [bleep]
do you do for my brother?

57:19.502 --> 57:22.571
[Lacey] Not only,
have loved your brother more

57:22.573 --> 57:25.741
- than any other woman.
- How do you love my brother if you [bleep] April?

57:25.743 --> 57:28.777
You've only been with that
mother-[bleep] since April.

57:28.779 --> 57:29.845
[Lacey] Okay. What do I need

57:29.847 --> 57:32.815
to do now, Sharon,
to approve, get your approval?

57:32.817 --> 57:34.383
[Sharon] I don't know.
You don't have my approval.

57:34.385 --> 57:35.784
Stab my heart out?
Get a knife?

57:35.786 --> 57:37.953
[Sharon] I'll guarantee you.
I'll [bleep] stand up and be like,

57:37.955 --> 57:40.856
"No, Ricky, don't do it."
Guaran-[bleep]-teed.

57:40.858 --> 57:42.691
Because I'll be [bleep]

57:42.693 --> 57:45.961
if my brother, moves down to
[bleep] Texas,

57:45.963 --> 57:50.065
with a [bleep] that can't do
[bleep] for herself!

57:50.067 --> 57:53.235
Dude, I need to pull, I need
to... We pulling [bleep] over.

57:54.604 --> 57:56.672
<i>[Sharon] Ricky is
my responsibility.</i>

57:56.674 --> 57:58.774
<i>And he's an
emotional apoplectic.</i>

57:58.776 --> 58:01.777
<i>So that means he has seizures.</i>

58:01.779 --> 58:03.712
And the severity of his
seizures depending

58:03.714 --> 58:05.414
on how emotionally charged
he is.

58:06.282 --> 58:08.484
<i>So, I gotta protect him,
you know.</i>

58:08.486 --> 58:10.052
<i>But she's just taking advantage.</i>

58:10.054 --> 58:11.653
<i>She don't give a [bleep]
about my brother.</i>

58:11.655 --> 58:14.890
<i>Which I always kind of knew.
It was just...</i>

58:14.892 --> 58:17.793
If I try to say some,
and try to tell people some,

58:17.795 --> 58:19.495
<i>they're not trying to hear it.</i>

58:19.497 --> 58:22.865
<i>So I had to kind of
let it unravel</i>

58:22.867 --> 58:26.935
<i>before I can be like, "Well,
see, I [bleep] told you."</i>

58:26.937 --> 58:28.804
She is... In reality,
she just needs someone

58:28.806 --> 58:31.173
to take care of her 'cause
she can't take care of herself.

58:32.008 --> 58:33.442
Have you ever
really been in love?

58:33.743 --> 58:35.110
Yes, I have.

58:35.112 --> 58:36.512
[Sharon] How do you know
you love him?

58:36.514 --> 58:37.980
What is your definition of love?

58:37.982 --> 58:39.815
[Lacey] Because if anything
happened to him,

58:39.817 --> 58:41.016
I would be there for him.

58:41.018 --> 58:41.884
- [Sharon] Really?
- By his side.

58:41.886 --> 58:43.619
I highly [bleep] doubt that.

58:43.621 --> 58:44.686
[Sharon] Get the [bleep] out
of my car.

58:44.688 --> 58:46.989
Don't [bleep] lie
to me, [bleep].

58:55.832 --> 58:58.867
Yeah, I know you love me.
And I love you.

58:58.869 --> 59:01.069
But you gotta
still gotta tell the truth.

59:02.405 --> 59:04.039
If you lie a little bit,
make sure

59:04.041 --> 59:05.541
if you lie,
it ain't gonna hurt nobody.

59:05.543 --> 59:07.876
That's what I do.

59:07.878 --> 59:10.445
When I lie to you, it's more just
to basically, start a conversation.

59:13.116 --> 59:15.217
I love you.
You know I do, baby.

59:21.925 --> 59:23.926
Come on, let's go.

59:23.928 --> 59:25.527
Hey, I really have to go
to the bathroom.

59:25.529 --> 59:26.728
[Ricky] Let's go.

59:28.565 --> 59:30.198
Do you want me to stand
outside the door so you can go?

59:30.200 --> 59:32.167
No, I'm going to go
talk to Sharon.

59:38.841 --> 59:40.709
[Sharon] RG.

59:40.711 --> 59:42.744
You need to make
a mother-[bleep] decision.

59:42.746 --> 59:44.746
I wanna give it a try!

59:44.748 --> 59:46.682
Why? What do you wanna
give a try about?

59:46.684 --> 59:49.685
She has not lost [bleep] weight.

59:49.687 --> 59:52.120
She has not tried
to lose weight.

59:52.122 --> 59:53.922
I have kept my mouth shut

59:53.924 --> 59:56.158
for the longest!

59:57.026 --> 59:57.759
I ain't doing it no more.

59:57.761 --> 59:59.995
She uses you.

59:59.997 --> 1:00:01.930
And she's a disgusting
[bleep] person.

1:00:01.932 --> 1:00:03.765
For doing it.

1:00:03.767 --> 1:00:06.969
You are not staying
in Texas. Okay?

1:00:07.136 --> 1:00:08.270
[Sharon] Good talk.

1:00:17.814 --> 1:00:19.181
Let's go.

1:00:41.838 --> 1:00:43.905
[Ricky] You know what, babe?
I'mma be, I'm a,

1:00:43.907 --> 1:00:46.108
sorry, but I'mma be honest
with you.

1:00:46.609 --> 1:00:47.843
I understand. I'm, yeah,

1:00:47.845 --> 1:00:49.945
I'm busting my [bleep]
and I'm trying to

1:00:49.947 --> 1:00:52.080
put a blind eye through
a lot of [bleep].

1:00:52.415 --> 1:00:54.883
Look, if this is
you lying to me,

1:00:54.885 --> 1:00:56.718
I have no problem taking this
ring back and giving it back,

1:00:56.720 --> 1:00:57.986
and saying, "[bleep] it."

1:00:57.988 --> 1:01:01.623
I ain't going to stay
in Texas, away from my family,

1:01:01.625 --> 1:01:02.624
if she ain't going to do the...

1:01:02.626 --> 1:01:04.226
What this program is meant for.

1:01:04.228 --> 1:01:06.595
What's the [bleep] point
of me being around?

1:01:06.597 --> 1:01:08.797
[Lacey] I did not give up
on you, Ricky. I have not.

1:01:08.799 --> 1:01:09.931
-[Sharon] You have not
brought him up -I have not.

1:01:09.933 --> 1:01:11.700
Good positive way.

1:01:11.702 --> 1:01:13.368
- Not one time!
- I love you, Ricky.

1:01:13.370 --> 1:01:15.337
- [Sharon] She's lying, Ricky.
- [Lacey] I have told you.

1:01:15.339 --> 1:01:17.906
- [Sharon] Ricky, when someone lied...
- And told you, and told you.

1:01:17.908 --> 1:01:19.841
- [Sharon] No, no.
- I would do anything for you, Ricky!

1:01:19.843 --> 1:01:21.710
And I told you I'd screw up.

1:01:21.712 --> 1:01:23.679
I don't know anymore.

1:01:23.681 --> 1:01:26.848
I don't know what's true
and what's not true.

1:01:26.850 --> 1:01:29.951
[Sharon] Deep down inside,
Rick, you know [bleep] well.

1:01:29.953 --> 1:01:31.753
I only make sure you're okay.

1:01:31.755 --> 1:01:35.023
And this [bleep]
can't even make real tears.

1:01:36.426 --> 1:01:37.826
She's trying to fake cry
right now, next to me.

1:01:37.828 --> 1:01:38.927
[Lacey] I'm not
trying to fake cry.

1:01:38.929 --> 1:01:40.395
[Sharon] You trying
to fake cry now.

1:01:40.397 --> 1:01:41.563
[Lacey] I'm overcome
with emotion.

1:01:41.565 --> 1:01:43.065
I don't want to lose
Ricky, okay?

1:01:43.067 --> 1:01:44.966
[Sharon] Yeah, well,
you're a [bleep] liar!

1:01:48.204 --> 1:01:50.238
And I don't... I'm done.

1:01:50.640 --> 1:01:51.740
[Sharon] Done.

1:01:51.742 --> 1:01:54.242
If there's a [bleep]
gas station, bro.

1:01:54.244 --> 1:01:55.711
You're getting left
at Temple, Texas.

1:02:02.618 --> 1:02:05.287
[GPS navigation speaking] <i>Turn
left on Martin Luther King Jr. Drive.</i>

1:02:10.593 --> 1:02:12.394
[Sharon] Just drop her
[bleep] here.

1:02:12.396 --> 1:02:13.862
Calling an emergency
phone number.

1:02:13.864 --> 1:02:15.831
[Sharon] Stupid [bleep].

1:02:15.833 --> 1:02:18.066
I'mma kill you.
In your [bleep] sleep

1:02:18.068 --> 1:02:20.202
every [bleep] which way around.

1:02:21.437 --> 1:02:23.972
<i>[Lacey] I don't even feel safe</i>

1:02:23.974 --> 1:02:25.974
<i>being around Sharon any longer.</i>

1:02:25.976 --> 1:02:27.442
<i>And I have to do something.</i>

1:02:27.444 --> 1:02:30.779
Hi, um... My name
is Lacey Buckingham.

1:02:30.781 --> 1:02:34.916
Um, I'm at this gas station.
And I'm from Washington state.

1:02:34.918 --> 1:02:38.453
And, um, the driver,
Sharon Gilmore,

1:02:38.455 --> 1:02:40.589
and my ex-fiance, Ricky,

1:02:40.591 --> 1:02:43.391
are driving me
to Pasadena, Texas.

1:02:43.393 --> 1:02:46.061
I'm scared 'cause I'm going to
be dropped off in this parking lot

1:02:46.063 --> 1:02:47.763
and I'm disabled.
I have, you know,

1:02:47.765 --> 1:02:49.464
a 6 by 12 trailer,

1:02:49.466 --> 1:02:53.034
and I'm just not sure
what I'm doing right now.

1:02:57.640 --> 1:03:00.776
- [officer] Just so I can get everything straight.
- [Lacey] Yes?

1:03:00.778 --> 1:03:03.011
[officer] We'll go back over
things. So he was your boyfriend.

1:03:03.045 --> 1:03:04.379
[Lacey] Yes.

1:03:04.446 --> 1:03:07.215
[officer] And he just broke up
with you, just a few minutes ago?

1:03:07.217 --> 1:03:11.219
- [Lacey] Yeah, basically, Sharon, his sister, you know.
- [officer] Prior to that call?

1:03:11.221 --> 1:03:13.021
- [officer] Is that Sharon that's in the car?
- [Lacey] Yeah, she's the...

1:03:13.023 --> 1:03:15.724
- [officer] So it's his sister?
- [Lacey] Yeah, she says she's power of attorney.

1:03:15.726 --> 1:03:16.892
[officer] Okay. Okay.

1:03:16.894 --> 1:03:19.694
- [Lacey] I'm in trouble, sir.
- [officer] Why?

1:03:19.696 --> 1:03:20.829
[Lacey] Because
they're gonna leave me here

1:03:20.831 --> 1:03:23.899
and I'll be homeless
in Pasadena with nothing.

1:03:23.901 --> 1:03:25.467
[officer] Why don't you
sit down and relax, okay?

1:03:25.469 --> 1:03:26.601
- Calm down.
- [Lacey] Okay.

1:03:26.603 --> 1:03:28.770
[officer] And let me go
over there and talk to them,

1:03:28.772 --> 1:03:31.206
- so we can figure out what's goin' on, okay?
- [Lacey] Okay.

1:03:32.542 --> 1:03:33.475
[melancholy music playing]

1:03:38.514 --> 1:03:40.649
[Ricky] Call cops
on my [bleep] for [bleep].

1:03:40.651 --> 1:03:42.651
- [Lacey] I didn't call the cops on you.
- [Ricky] You did.

1:03:42.653 --> 1:03:44.653
[Ricky] Don't, don't,
get your, go back over there.

1:03:44.655 --> 1:03:45.720
- Get over there.
- Well, I need my things out.

1:03:45.722 --> 1:03:47.923
[Sharon] Ricky,
get your clothes.

1:03:47.925 --> 1:03:51.126
Lacey, don't you ever in your
right mind speak to me again.

1:03:51.128 --> 1:03:53.862
Don't say nothing to me.
You lucky the police are here.

1:03:53.864 --> 1:03:54.629
[bleep]

1:03:54.631 --> 1:03:56.832
And I'm halfway across country.

1:03:56.834 --> 1:04:00.936
You just praise God that right
now I can control my composure.

1:04:00.938 --> 1:04:03.772
I made a promise to God
to take care of you.

1:04:03.774 --> 1:04:05.740
I never broke it.
Why would I hurt you?

1:04:05.742 --> 1:04:08.643
Now, you wouldn't hurt me.
Sharon!

1:04:08.645 --> 1:04:10.679
- You said them at me.
- No, I did not. I said Sharon.

1:04:10.681 --> 1:04:12.414
Well, however you wanna put it.

1:04:12.416 --> 1:04:13.815
- You know, I took care of you.
- Okay, well, I don't know...

1:04:13.817 --> 1:04:14.716
I even wiped your own [bleep].

1:04:14.718 --> 1:04:17.552
How's that for a debt?
I just...

1:04:17.554 --> 1:04:20.021
It's got a lock on it and I
don't know how to do that.

1:04:20.890 --> 1:04:22.424
I just want my oxygen,
my sleep machine.

1:04:22.758 --> 1:04:24.926
Thank you.

1:04:24.928 --> 1:04:26.528
- Thank you for wiping my butt.
- [Ricky] The lock is in my...

1:04:26.530 --> 1:04:29.231
- [stammers] It's not even my lock.
- Thank you for wiping my butt.

1:04:32.969 --> 1:04:34.436
<i>And she started to call
the police department</i>

1:04:34.438 --> 1:04:37.239
and said
we were all trying to hurt her

1:04:37.241 --> 1:04:40.141
or in my case, she's trying
to blame me for abusing her.

1:04:40.143 --> 1:04:43.378
[Sharon] Get whatever [bleep]
she needs off my U-Haul,

1:04:43.380 --> 1:04:45.580
and her [bleep] is gone.

1:04:45.582 --> 1:04:49.784
You watch [bleep] and we'll
be at the [bleep] U-Haul place.

1:04:49.786 --> 1:04:54.122
Woman, you don't even know
what the [bleep] you just did.

1:05:00.696 --> 1:05:02.430
<i>[Ricky] I'm not
an abusive person.</i>

1:05:02.432 --> 1:05:05.901
I'm a realest, nicest,
greatest person alive.

1:05:05.903 --> 1:05:10.538
I would go above and beyond
for my, for my woman.

1:05:10.540 --> 1:05:14.809
[stammers] <i>Are we still
together, she asked me.</i>

1:05:14.811 --> 1:05:18.980
Oh my Lord, God. I'm
like, "What? [bleep] you. No!

1:05:18.982 --> 1:05:20.382
We're done."

1:05:22.285 --> 1:05:26.588
Officer, can I...
please talk to you?

1:05:26.590 --> 1:05:29.024
Can I please be, bless
your soul, help me carry this?

1:05:29.026 --> 1:05:30.325
- Yeah, we can do--
- Please, just...

1:05:30.327 --> 1:05:31.893
Where are you gonna go?

1:05:31.895 --> 1:05:34.062
Just to the corner, so I can
get some water and call a taxi.

1:05:34.430 --> 1:05:35.430
Please.

1:05:35.432 --> 1:05:36.831
<i>I feel like
I'm hyperventilating.</i>

1:05:36.833 --> 1:05:38.667
<i>And the heat is getting to me,</i>

1:05:38.669 --> 1:05:40.468
<i>and then I'm gonna
to have a heart attack.</i>

1:05:40.470 --> 1:05:43.605
<i>I can feel I'm gonna have
a heart attack if I stay here.</i>

1:05:43.607 --> 1:05:45.874
<i>With the heat and the stress,
I can feel it,</i>

1:05:45.876 --> 1:05:48.777
<i>so I have to get
somewhere safe now</i>

1:05:48.779 --> 1:05:51.313
<i>before I pass out
or something bad happens.</i>

1:05:52.648 --> 1:05:54.316
- Thank you, sir.
- No problem.

1:05:59.956 --> 1:06:01.856
- [medic 1] How're you doing?
- So...

1:06:01.858 --> 1:06:03.291
- [medic 1] What's going on?
- Um...

1:06:05.995 --> 1:06:07.429
- Well...
- What's your name?

1:06:07.431 --> 1:06:08.596
- Lacey Buckingham.
- All right.

1:06:08.598 --> 1:06:10.298
- My name is Doug.
- [Lacey] Doug.

1:06:11.734 --> 1:06:14.436
Um, mentally, I'm very exhausted
and I need to be checked out.

1:06:14.438 --> 1:06:16.037
I have cellulitis
in my left leg.

1:06:16.039 --> 1:06:19.174
- I have lymphedema, and my oxygen is messed up.
- Okay.

1:06:19.176 --> 1:06:20.174
That's my oxygen.

1:06:20.176 --> 1:06:21.876
Um, can we take you
to St. Joseph in Bryan?

1:06:21.878 --> 1:06:22.944
- Yes, please.
- It's the closest hospital.

1:06:22.946 --> 1:06:24.646
- Yes, please.
- Is that okay?

1:06:24.648 --> 1:06:28.016
- Can I please bring just this?
- Yeah, we can make that happen.

1:06:28.018 --> 1:06:29.718
- Okay.
- Yeah, yeah. It's good.

1:06:29.720 --> 1:06:31.286
He'll hold this to make sure.

1:06:31.288 --> 1:06:32.754
- Can you hold this, please?
- Yes, ma'am, I got you.

1:06:32.756 --> 1:06:34.089
Yes.

1:06:34.091 --> 1:06:36.124
- Here, grab my hand if you need it.
- Yep.

1:06:37.760 --> 1:06:39.060
[medic 1] There you go.

1:06:40.029 --> 1:06:40.729
- [medic 2] Get you a little more centered, okay.
- Thank you.

1:06:40.731 --> 1:06:42.731
- [medic 1] There you go.
- Okay.

1:06:42.733 --> 1:06:44.199
- [medic 1] You wanna sit up a little bit more.
- There you go.

1:06:44.201 --> 1:06:46.034
<i>[Lacey] I'm exhausted.</i>

1:06:46.936 --> 1:06:48.937
<i>Having mental.</i>

1:06:48.939 --> 1:06:50.271
<i>Now I'm having mental problems.</i>

1:06:50.840 --> 1:06:52.340
One, two, three.

1:06:52.342 --> 1:06:53.975
[Lacey exhales]

1:07:09.959 --> 1:07:12.327
[melancholy music playing]

1:07:32.448 --> 1:07:36.751
<i>[Lacey] I was hoping they'd let
me stay the night at the hospital.</i>

1:07:36.753 --> 1:07:39.320
<i>But they said I couldn't stay
'cause nothing was wrong with me.</i>

1:07:39.922 --> 1:07:40.588
<i>But that's not accurate.</i>

1:07:40.590 --> 1:07:42.323
<i>But, whatever.</i>

1:07:44.593 --> 1:07:49.431
<i>I don't know where Ricky and
Sharon are, and where all my stuff is.</i>

1:07:52.234 --> 1:07:57.205
<i>But I haven't texted them because
I don't wanna to talk to either of 'em.</i>

1:07:59.075 --> 1:08:03.178
<i>And I'm not sure what's gonna
happen between me and Ricky.</i>

1:08:03.180 --> 1:08:08.883
<i>Because I feel like he really let me
down when I needed him the most.</i>

1:08:08.885 --> 1:08:13.154
<i>Sharon went verbally psycho
on me, and he didn't stop her.</i>

1:08:13.489 --> 1:08:14.755
Thank you.

1:08:14.757 --> 1:08:18.293
<i>So it feels like everything
in my life is falling apart.</i>

1:08:18.928 --> 1:08:20.095
Thank you so much.

1:08:20.097 --> 1:08:22.163
<i>I'm not sure what I'm gonna do.</i>

1:08:28.471 --> 1:08:30.305
[melancholy music playing]

1:08:47.990 --> 1:08:52.193
[Ricky] Look, we felt bad
for you, just abandoning you.

1:08:52.195 --> 1:08:56.564
So, we, uh, got your stuff
in the back of the truck.

1:08:56.566 --> 1:08:59.868
We can take you to Dr. Now
and drop you off

1:08:59.870 --> 1:09:04.405
wherever you want, and then I'm
headin' back, I'm done, we're done.

1:09:04.407 --> 1:09:06.474
There's no way I'm
getting back in that Tahoe.

1:09:06.476 --> 1:09:07.708
Sorry.

1:09:07.710 --> 1:09:10.478
First, not only a man that
won't stand up for me ever,

1:09:10.480 --> 1:09:15.950
but a sister that, your
sister that wants to kill me.

1:09:15.952 --> 1:09:18.386
So, no, there's no way
I'm going back in that Tahoe.

1:09:19.989 --> 1:09:22.257
I just want you to know

1:09:22.725 --> 1:09:25.093
I did love you,

1:09:25.095 --> 1:09:29.397
and I never meant harm.

1:09:29.399 --> 1:09:34.035
Last night, I did not sleep.
I feel cold.

1:09:35.738 --> 1:09:37.972
You were a very good man to me,

1:09:37.974 --> 1:09:41.309
and I tried to be a very,
very good woman for you.

1:09:41.977 --> 1:09:43.344
Sorry, it ended like this.

1:09:45.414 --> 1:09:46.347
[clicks tongue]

1:09:46.815 --> 1:09:49.717
Well, that's how
we wanna leave it,

1:09:49.719 --> 1:09:52.153
- we can, uh, leave it at there.
- Okay.

1:09:52.755 --> 1:09:54.355
- Um.
- [Lacey] Have a nice life.

1:09:56.859 --> 1:09:58.426
- And I wish you a nice life, too.
- Okay.

1:10:02.831 --> 1:10:03.998
I'm headin' out.

1:10:05.968 --> 1:10:07.268
[Ricky sighs]

1:10:08.604 --> 1:10:12.240
Worked so hard on that
relationship and crazy...

1:10:18.047 --> 1:10:19.981
- Okay.
- [Sharon] All right, let's go.

1:10:23.819 --> 1:10:25.019
[Ricky sniffles]

1:10:26.088 --> 1:10:27.355
It's okay, Ricky.

1:10:28.090 --> 1:10:29.991
It's okay. Look.

1:10:30.726 --> 1:10:32.393
RG, don't cry.

1:10:32.995 --> 1:10:35.163
[bleep] that [bleep].

1:10:35.165 --> 1:10:37.298
- This hurts.
- She is nasty.

1:10:37.766 --> 1:10:39.367
She look nasty.

1:10:39.369 --> 1:10:41.869
She didn't take care of herself.

1:10:41.871 --> 1:10:44.305
How could you even wanna be
seen in public with somebody like that?

1:10:44.573 --> 1:10:46.107
My Ricky.

1:11:23.412 --> 1:11:27.982
<i>The only option I have is
from a person I found online</i>

1:11:27.984 --> 1:11:30.018
<i>from my hometown to
help me since I'm stranded.</i>

1:11:30.020 --> 1:11:32.820
- [Michelle] Hi, Lacey.
- Hi.

1:11:32.822 --> 1:11:35.790
Thank you so much.
God bless you.

1:11:35.792 --> 1:11:38.159
- [Michelle] No problem.
- For comin', short notice.

1:11:38.161 --> 1:11:39.394
Yeah, give me a hug.

1:11:41.864 --> 1:11:43.164
[Lacey cries]

1:11:44.033 --> 1:11:45.800
[Michelle] It will be okay.

1:11:45.802 --> 1:11:47.669
- You're okay.
- You've known me a long time.

1:11:47.671 --> 1:11:49.136
Yes, you'll be fine.

1:11:50.572 --> 1:11:53.708
<i>[Lacey] Her name is Michelle,
and she said her and her family</i>

1:11:53.710 --> 1:11:57.011
<i>are planning to move
to Houston from Washington.</i>

1:11:57.680 --> 1:12:00.748
<i>And so that was perfect
for my situation.</i>

1:12:00.750 --> 1:12:02.750
<i>And after I told her
what happened to me,</i>

1:12:02.752 --> 1:12:06.220
<i>she said I might be able to
live with her and her family.</i>

1:12:07.222 --> 1:12:10.224
<i>So that was something
like a miracle for me.</i>

1:12:21.236 --> 1:12:26.207
<i>This has been one of the worst and
most miserable experience in my life.</i>

1:12:26.209 --> 1:12:31.579
<i>And I'm scared now, it's all gonna be
for nothing, if I don't get Dr. Now's help.</i>

1:12:31.581 --> 1:12:36.050
<i>Because I know if I don't get
some kind of big help like that soon,</i>

1:12:36.052 --> 1:12:38.252
<i>then I'm probably not going
to be around much longer.</i>

1:12:45.794 --> 1:12:46.627
Lacey.

1:12:46.629 --> 1:12:48.296
[suspenseful music playing]

1:12:50.699 --> 1:12:54.402
[Lacey] <i>At my last
appointment, I was 593,</i>

1:12:54.404 --> 1:12:58.106
<i>and the goal Dr. Now gave me
was to lose 50 pounds.</i>

1:12:58.140 --> 1:12:59.340
Thank you.

1:13:00.676 --> 1:13:04.112
<i>So that means I should have
gone down to 543.</i>

1:13:05.714 --> 1:13:08.349
<i>[Lacey] So that's what
I'm really hoping it is.</i>

1:13:15.090 --> 1:13:16.391
That's not good enough.

1:13:16.859 --> 1:13:19.026
[sighs]

1:13:20.662 --> 1:13:22.663
<i>That's a really big shock
to me, because...</i>

1:13:22.665 --> 1:13:25.299
<i>I really thought
I had lost more.</i>

1:13:28.003 --> 1:13:32.039
<i>So I'm confused and upset,
because I've worked so hard.</i>

1:13:32.341 --> 1:13:33.875
<i>You know, I'm a food addict,</i>

1:13:33.877 --> 1:13:36.778
<i>and I've been giving up
the food I want for a while,</i>

1:13:36.780 --> 1:13:39.414
<i>so I feel like I should have
a lot more of a result.</i>

1:13:41.083 --> 1:13:43.718
<i>And so, to have
such little progress</i>

1:13:43.720 --> 1:13:46.721
<i>is like a punch to my face.</i>

1:13:46.723 --> 1:13:48.623
<i>That's how much
of a shock it is to me.</i>

1:13:48.625 --> 1:13:50.057
<i>I'm very worried,</i>

1:13:50.059 --> 1:13:53.428
<i>because I know that weight
isn't gonna be enough</i>

1:13:53.430 --> 1:13:55.263
<i>for Dr. Now to approve me.</i>

1:13:55.265 --> 1:13:58.466
Yeah, it's not what I expected.

1:13:58.468 --> 1:14:00.568
<i>And that's what I've been
working so hard for,</i>

1:14:00.570 --> 1:14:02.837
<i>so I'm disappointed
and scared right now,</i>

1:14:02.839 --> 1:14:04.939
<i>because I don't know
what's gonna happen,</i>

1:14:04.941 --> 1:14:07.141
<i>and I don't know
what I'm gonna do</i>

1:14:07.143 --> 1:14:09.410
<i>if I'm not getting
weight-loss surgery.</i>

1:14:14.783 --> 1:14:15.950
- Hello.
- Hello.

1:14:15.952 --> 1:14:17.985
- How y'all doing?
- Good.

1:14:17.987 --> 1:14:20.455
It looked like you got
a new friend now.

1:14:20.457 --> 1:14:22.824
Yeah, this is
my friend, Michelle.

1:14:22.826 --> 1:14:25.927
She's from Tri-Cities
where I was born and raised.

1:14:25.929 --> 1:14:27.395
Where is Tri-City?

1:14:27.397 --> 1:14:28.930
Tri-Cities, Washington.

1:14:28.932 --> 1:14:30.598
Oh, okay.

1:14:30.600 --> 1:14:33.000
So you came all the way
down to Houston?

1:14:33.002 --> 1:14:36.337
Well, my family and I were
coming down to Texas anyway,

1:14:36.339 --> 1:14:38.706
and so, um, she called me

1:14:38.708 --> 1:14:40.141
and said that
she needed some help,

1:14:40.143 --> 1:14:42.844
so I drove down from Kilgore.

1:14:42.846 --> 1:14:44.912
- So you're the helper.
- [Michelle] Mmm-hmm.

1:14:44.914 --> 1:14:47.682
So what happened
to your boyfriend?

1:14:47.684 --> 1:14:50.051
A series of misfortunate events.

1:14:50.886 --> 1:14:52.787
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

1:14:52.789 --> 1:14:53.921
Thanks.

1:14:53.923 --> 1:14:57.925
So you said you're moving
down here a couple weeks ago,

1:14:57.927 --> 1:15:00.962
on a video call,
so did you do that?

1:15:00.964 --> 1:15:01.796
No.

1:15:01.798 --> 1:15:04.932
So you're still
living in Washington.

1:15:04.934 --> 1:15:06.767
[Lacey] No,
I'm not living there.

1:15:06.769 --> 1:15:09.170
So where do you live now?

1:15:09.172 --> 1:15:10.738
I don't live anywhere now,

1:15:10.740 --> 1:15:14.675
I was moving to Houston,

1:15:14.677 --> 1:15:17.011
and the apartment
that I was going to live in

1:15:17.013 --> 1:15:19.914
fell through, so that,
there's no apartment here.

1:15:19.916 --> 1:15:21.716
And I have no things,

1:15:21.718 --> 1:15:23.784
no furniture for the apartment.

1:15:23.786 --> 1:15:27.655
Just my pills, and my body
and some clothes.

1:15:27.657 --> 1:15:30.391
So looks like you got
too many issues

1:15:30.393 --> 1:15:32.693
to tackle in your life
right now.

1:15:32.695 --> 1:15:35.396
Yeah, lots of...

1:15:35.398 --> 1:15:38.666
So what seems to be your idea
about where you're gonna

1:15:38.668 --> 1:15:41.435
be staying, and where
you're gonna go?

1:15:41.437 --> 1:15:44.672
Well, I want to try to live,
to keep living in Texas.

1:15:44.674 --> 1:15:46.040
So Michelle said,

1:15:46.042 --> 1:15:48.409
maybe I could just live
with her family,

1:15:48.411 --> 1:15:50.344
so that would solve my problem.

1:15:50.346 --> 1:15:52.647
Where does Michelle live?
Where do you live?

1:15:52.649 --> 1:15:55.950
We're in-between right now,
but we do have some finances

1:15:55.952 --> 1:15:59.654
to try to work out getting
a place here in Houston.

1:15:59.656 --> 1:16:02.156
Uh, my husband
and my other children

1:16:02.158 --> 1:16:04.492
are still up in Kilgore,
so I'll go get them

1:16:04.494 --> 1:16:08.663
and bring them, and get moved
into a place, um, together with Lacey.

1:16:08.665 --> 1:16:11.866
I think we can afford
a home here somewhere.

1:16:11.868 --> 1:16:14.001
It's just a matter
of finding something.

1:16:14.003 --> 1:16:15.570
[Lacey] So hopefully,
I can do that,

1:16:15.572 --> 1:16:17.271
because I'm trying
to figure it out.

1:16:17.273 --> 1:16:20.007
So I can get back on track
on what I'm supposed to do.

1:16:20.009 --> 1:16:20.942
Okay.

1:16:20.944 --> 1:16:23.744
So I really, really, really...

1:16:23.746 --> 1:16:25.780
I don't know if I deserve
a second chance,

1:16:25.782 --> 1:16:29.016
but I want, I want
a second chance.

1:16:29.018 --> 1:16:31.085
[Dr. Now] Lacey,
you're gonna have to

1:16:31.087 --> 1:16:32.053
decide what you're gonna do now.

1:16:32.055 --> 1:16:34.956
Because it seems like
you got so many

1:16:34.958 --> 1:16:36.857
domestic problems to tackle

1:16:36.859 --> 1:16:40.161
before you even, uh,
start worrying about

1:16:40.163 --> 1:16:42.430
what are you gonna do,
where are you gonna be.

1:16:43.365 --> 1:16:44.965
So you need to work on

1:16:44.967 --> 1:16:50.504
bringing some stability to your life,
and figuring some things out, long term.

1:16:50.506 --> 1:16:53.741
So you have to make
some serious decisions

1:16:53.743 --> 1:16:55.943
about what you're gonna do,
and how you're gonna

1:16:55.945 --> 1:16:57.912
stick with your
healthy eating habit.

1:16:57.914 --> 1:16:59.046
- Mmm-hmm.
- [Dr. Now] That's not gonna

1:16:59.048 --> 1:17:01.716
come, uh, natural when you have

1:17:01.718 --> 1:17:03.851
no idea where you're going,
or where you're coming.

1:17:03.853 --> 1:17:05.586
- [Lacey] Mmm-hmm.
- Okay.

1:17:05.588 --> 1:17:07.955
Yeah, at this point
right now I'm homeless, so...

1:17:07.957 --> 1:17:12.059
Well, you still have a home
in, back in Washington, right?

1:17:12.061 --> 1:17:15.062
Yeah, it's just
an empty apartment right now.

1:17:15.064 --> 1:17:18.132
So you're gonna see which way
the wind is blowing,

1:17:18.134 --> 1:17:19.400
and you're going that way.

1:17:20.235 --> 1:17:21.602
[Lacey] Yep.

1:17:21.670 --> 1:17:24.739
[Dr. Now] Well, you have a lot
of your life to figure out right now.

1:17:24.741 --> 1:17:27.608
So I'm gonna let you
figure that out,

1:17:27.610 --> 1:17:29.410
where you're gonna live,
where you're gonna be.

1:17:29.412 --> 1:17:32.179
But if you want
to continue with the program,

1:17:32.181 --> 1:17:34.949
then you have to lose
at least fifty pounds

1:17:34.951 --> 1:17:36.684
to show me you're committed

1:17:36.686 --> 1:17:39.253
to take responsibility
for your life.

1:17:41.723 --> 1:17:46.127
If not, then it won't matter
if you're living down here.

1:17:57.406 --> 1:17:59.940
And if you don't follow that,
there's nothing we can do

1:17:59.942 --> 1:18:02.610
- to change that, okay?
- Yes.

1:18:02.612 --> 1:18:05.179
So stick with
healthy eating habit,

1:18:05.181 --> 1:18:06.814
read the stuff we gave you
every night,

1:18:06.816 --> 1:18:09.417
and check up and see
what you did wrong,

1:18:09.419 --> 1:18:11.552
and don't make
those mistakes tomorrow.

1:18:11.554 --> 1:18:12.820
- Okay?
- Yes, sir.

1:18:12.822 --> 1:18:15.022
- You think you can do that?
- Yes.

1:18:15.024 --> 1:18:17.258
I've got to, it's...

1:18:17.592 --> 1:18:19.960
not a game anymore.

1:18:19.962 --> 1:18:22.863
You know, it's not a game
to just eat fast food

1:18:22.865 --> 1:18:24.765
and think you're gonna
lose weight.

1:18:24.767 --> 1:18:27.868
All right, so, if you need
anything, give me a call.

1:18:27.870 --> 1:18:29.870
- [Lacey] Yes.
- And let me know

1:18:29.872 --> 1:18:31.706
- how things going, okay?
- Okay.

1:18:31.708 --> 1:18:33.974
- I wish you good luck.
- [Lacey] Okay, thank you.

1:18:33.976 --> 1:18:35.976
- And nice to meet you.
- [Michelle] You too.

1:18:35.978 --> 1:18:38.245
All right, we'll see
you all later.

1:18:42.584 --> 1:18:43.484
<i>[Dr. Now] Right now,</i>

1:18:43.585 --> 1:18:45.319
<i>things aren't
looking good for Lacey.</i>

1:18:46.988 --> 1:18:49.924
I'm not seeing anything
to convince me

1:18:49.926 --> 1:18:50.858
she means what she says,

1:18:50.860 --> 1:18:53.027
<i>or that she's going to take</i>

1:18:53.029 --> 1:18:55.629
<i>a level of responsibility
for her life.</i>

1:18:55.631 --> 1:18:58.032
So I am very concerned.

1:18:58.034 --> 1:19:00.901
<i>In five months, she hardly
lost any weight,</i>

1:19:00.903 --> 1:19:05.706
and she still has a list
of excuses for why that is.

1:19:05.708 --> 1:19:08.642
<i>So she's clearly not following
the instructions</i>

1:19:08.644 --> 1:19:11.045
<i>for her diet and exercise.</i>

1:19:11.480 --> 1:19:13.748
<i>So she decided
to move down here,</i>

1:19:13.750 --> 1:19:15.716
<i>despite what I told her
she needed to do.</i>

1:19:15.718 --> 1:19:17.818
And then on top of all that,

1:19:17.820 --> 1:19:21.889
<i>she seems to make rash
and impulsive life decisions</i>

1:19:21.891 --> 1:19:24.525
<i>to the point where her life
seems constantly</i>

1:19:24.527 --> 1:19:25.960
<i>in flux and chaotic.</i>

1:19:25.962 --> 1:19:30.131
And I think she orchestrates
that to some degree.

1:19:31.299 --> 1:19:33.768
<i>Because it is a constant excuse</i>

1:19:33.770 --> 1:19:35.736
for her unhealthy choices.

1:19:35.738 --> 1:19:38.939
<i>So right now, I'm not sure
she's going to be willing</i>

1:19:38.941 --> 1:19:40.808
to give up the way she's living.

1:19:40.810 --> 1:19:42.710
<i>I'm very concerned</i>

1:19:42.712 --> 1:19:44.779
<i>because if she
keeps going like this,</i>

1:19:44.781 --> 1:19:46.280
<i>then it won't take long</i>

1:19:46.282 --> 1:19:48.582
for her to get
to a breaking point.

1:19:48.584 --> 1:19:54.021
And once that happens, her situation
is gonna become far more dire.

1:19:54.023 --> 1:19:57.858
<i>So I'm hoping she wakes up
and takes the steps she needs</i>

1:19:57.860 --> 1:19:59.994
<i>to try and do this.</i>

1:19:59.996 --> 1:20:02.196
But right now,
it's not looking likely.

1:20:04.666 --> 1:20:06.634
<i>[Lacey] I'm disappointed
I didn't get approved,</i>

1:20:06.636 --> 1:20:08.435
<i>but I'm actually proud of myself</i>

1:20:08.437 --> 1:20:10.004
<i>for telling the truth.
I did what was right,</i>

1:20:10.006 --> 1:20:11.772
<i>and that should count
for something</i>

1:20:11.774 --> 1:20:13.574
<i>because I didn't make excuses.</i>

1:20:13.576 --> 1:20:16.577
<i>So I'm hopeful for the future,</i>

1:20:16.579 --> 1:20:18.612
<i>but I still have to figure out
my living situation.</i>

1:20:18.614 --> 1:20:20.848
<i>And I know I just
have to do better,</i>

1:20:20.850 --> 1:20:25.953
<i>and this time I'm not letting anyone
or anything mess that up for me.</i>

1:20:39.768 --> 1:20:42.937
<i>[Lacey] My whole world
is falling apart.</i>

1:20:43.705 --> 1:20:47.942
<i>Things didn't work out
with Michelle and her family.</i>

1:20:48.677 --> 1:20:49.910
<i>They tried and they helped me.</i>

1:20:49.912 --> 1:20:51.579
<i>But they basically decided,</i>

1:20:51.581 --> 1:20:55.182
<i>they aren't moving
to Houston for a while.</i>

1:20:58.420 --> 1:21:01.889
<i>So I just asked if they could
bring me back to Washington,</i>

1:21:01.891 --> 1:21:04.225
<i>because I had
nowhere else to go.</i>

1:21:06.461 --> 1:21:09.597
<i>And they did, but I don't
have anything,</i>

1:21:09.599 --> 1:21:12.433
<i>because Ricky and Sharon
took all my stuff</i>

1:21:12.435 --> 1:21:14.401
<i>and dropped it all
off somewhere.</i>

1:21:15.637 --> 1:21:17.404
<i>Like, pictures and stuff.</i>

1:21:18.907 --> 1:21:22.409
<i>Friends have helped me get
the material things I need.</i>

1:21:22.411 --> 1:21:26.780
<i>But it's the stuff I can't
ever replace that hurts.</i>

1:21:26.782 --> 1:21:29.350
This is all the stuff
that I was able to...

1:21:30.685 --> 1:21:34.054
get back from Texas.

1:21:34.823 --> 1:21:38.092
<i>I managed to get my lease back
on my place here,</i>

1:21:38.094 --> 1:21:40.594
<i>so I at least
figured out an option</i>

1:21:40.596 --> 1:21:43.063
<i>to avoid being homeless.</i>

1:21:43.065 --> 1:21:45.499
<i>I need to find a way
to be in Houston,</i>

1:21:45.501 --> 1:21:47.067
<i>place to live,</i>

1:21:47.069 --> 1:21:49.637
<i>I just don't know how
I'm gonna do that.</i>

1:21:49.639 --> 1:21:51.005
<i>Part of me is scared</i>

1:21:51.007 --> 1:21:54.241
<i>that I'm gonna lose
my chance to change my life.</i>

1:21:55.043 --> 1:21:57.278
<i>Not only did I lose my...</i>

1:21:58.747 --> 1:22:01.749
<i>valuable objects to me.</i>

1:22:01.751 --> 1:22:04.385
I just, I do miss Ricky.
I miss him.

1:22:10.425 --> 1:22:13.027
[crying] I lost a good friend.

1:22:26.675 --> 1:22:29.009
I let my church know I was back,

1:22:29.011 --> 1:22:31.946
and they were able to bring
back some of my furniture.

1:22:31.948 --> 1:22:34.648
<i>But now, I have to figure out</i>

1:22:34.650 --> 1:22:37.885
<i>getting my life
set back up here.</i>

1:22:37.887 --> 1:22:41.121
<i>I don't know
what my future holds now.</i>

1:22:41.756 --> 1:22:44.692
<i>I'm still trying to do
Dr. Now's program,</i>

1:22:44.694 --> 1:22:47.227
<i>because I need
weight loss surgery.</i>

1:22:47.929 --> 1:22:49.830
I am watching what I eat,

1:22:49.832 --> 1:22:51.999
I don't eat fast food
all the time.

1:22:52.001 --> 1:22:55.002
Um, salads are
a big thing for me.

1:22:55.036 --> 1:22:59.173
And I only eat until, like,

1:22:59.175 --> 1:23:02.142
right here says
"Hello, you're...

1:23:02.677 --> 1:23:03.577
you're full."

1:23:05.714 --> 1:23:07.381
<i>So I'm still
trying to get healthy,</i>

1:23:07.383 --> 1:23:08.949
<i>but I've honestly given up hope</i>

1:23:08.951 --> 1:23:12.653
<i>on being able to do his
program anytime soon,</i>

1:23:12.655 --> 1:23:14.555
<i>because I just don't have anyone</i>

1:23:14.557 --> 1:23:16.957
<i>who can help me move to Houston.</i>

1:23:20.495 --> 1:23:23.630
<i>Ricky was a godsend
who was helping me do that,</i>

1:23:23.632 --> 1:23:27.167
<i>and I can see how I took him
for granted in some ways.</i>

1:23:29.471 --> 1:23:33.207
<i>That doesn't mean
how he treated me was okay,</i>

1:23:33.209 --> 1:23:37.978
<i>and all I wanted was for him
to stick up for me,</i>

1:23:39.881 --> 1:23:41.315
<i>and he didn't.</i>

1:23:41.883 --> 1:23:43.984
<i>But my biggest regret</i>

1:23:43.986 --> 1:23:47.187
<i>is letting Sharon
take us to Houston.</i>

1:23:47.189 --> 1:23:48.689
<i>I think if it wasn't for her,</i>

1:23:48.691 --> 1:23:51.291
<i>me and Ricky
would still be together,</i>

1:23:51.293 --> 1:23:53.761
<i>and I'd be in Houston
doing the program,</i>

1:23:53.763 --> 1:23:55.662
<i>and getting my life back.</i>

1:23:55.664 --> 1:23:58.899
<i>Sharon's the one
that took that from me,</i>

1:23:58.901 --> 1:24:01.335
<i>and I never want to see
her again because of that.</i>

1:24:04.005 --> 1:24:05.406
Hello, come in!

1:24:05.974 --> 1:24:07.074
Hello!

1:24:07.076 --> 1:24:09.777
- [Lacey] Hey, Renee!
- Hello.

1:24:09.779 --> 1:24:11.745
You're right on time.

1:24:11.747 --> 1:24:13.147
Dinner's a' brewing.

1:24:14.015 --> 1:24:16.483
<i>[Lacey] Renee,
my best friend from church.</i>

1:24:16.485 --> 1:24:18.752
<i>She's been a big support,</i>

1:24:18.754 --> 1:24:20.888
and we're planning on getting
a new place together.

1:24:20.890 --> 1:24:22.423
How you doing?

1:24:22.425 --> 1:24:25.592
Well, I was very sad.

1:24:25.594 --> 1:24:28.695
But I've been praying a lot,
you know, and...

1:24:28.697 --> 1:24:31.832
going to church and talking
to the bishop and...

1:24:31.834 --> 1:24:33.901
Yeah, thank you so much
for coming over.

1:24:33.903 --> 1:24:36.336
[Renee] Anything
I can help you with.

1:24:36.338 --> 1:24:38.739
Yeah, so glad you live so close.

1:24:38.741 --> 1:24:41.475
<i>[Lacey] I don't know
what my future looks like.</i>

1:24:41.477 --> 1:24:44.411
<i>I just know, I'm gonna
keep fighting for it.</i>

1:24:44.413 --> 1:24:47.714
<i>Maybe me and Ricky
will get back together again,</i>

1:24:47.716 --> 1:24:49.683
<i>and we'll end up moving
to Houston together,</i>

1:24:49.685 --> 1:24:51.852
<i>like we planned.</i>

1:24:51.854 --> 1:24:52.753
I'm working on getting a bed.

1:24:52.755 --> 1:24:53.921
Oh, good.

1:24:53.923 --> 1:24:57.658
So if we, even if I get a one,
like, a one bedroom,

1:24:57.660 --> 1:25:00.194
you could,
I know it's stupid, but...

1:25:00.196 --> 1:25:02.930
No, no, no, we're gonna
have to get a two bedroom.

1:25:02.932 --> 1:25:03.931
Minimum.

1:25:03.933 --> 1:25:05.499
If I have to get a storage shed

1:25:05.501 --> 1:25:07.000
for all my stuff, then I will.

1:25:07.002 --> 1:25:10.571
