WEBVTT

00:01.160 --> 00:02.718
Previously on Elementary...

00:02.770 --> 00:05.091
The depravity and atrocity
numeration test.

00:05.130 --> 00:06.631
Someone is using
the DANTE survey

00:06.670 --> 00:08.558
to identify
and recruit psychopaths.

00:08.600 --> 00:10.204
Several years ago,

00:10.240 --> 00:11.537
I anticipated that,
without Moriarty,

00:11.570 --> 00:13.276
her group would fall apart.

00:13.310 --> 00:14.334
I was mistaken.

00:14.380 --> 00:16.109
Someone else has taken over.

00:16.150 --> 00:17.344
Who is Joshua Vikner?

00:17.380 --> 00:18.369
Economics professor.

00:18.410 --> 00:20.173
I'm quite certain
Professor Vi kner

00:20.220 --> 00:21.448
is the heir to
Jamie Moriarty's fetid throne.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.084
VIKNER:
You found me.

00:23.120 --> 00:25.338
But I want you to know
I bear you no ill will.

00:25.390 --> 00:26.789
Nor does anyone I oversee.

00:26.820 --> 00:27.809
You're untouchable.

00:27.860 --> 00:30.351
Jamie made it clear that you
were not to be harmed.

00:30.390 --> 00:32.096
Apologies for the subterfuge.

00:32.130 --> 00:33.688
I thought perhaps
we were being watched.

00:33.730 --> 00:35.288
There's a light on
in the McGuiness's apartment,

00:35.330 --> 00:36.194
across the way.

00:36.230 --> 00:37.219
They're out of town.

00:37.270 --> 00:40.433
Turns out I'm not paranoid.

00:42.840 --> 00:46.435
(rapid beeping)

00:53.250 --> 00:55.241
You're not breathing.

00:55.280 --> 00:57.419
That's because
I'm a little nervous.

00:57.450 --> 00:59.589
You needn't be.

00:59.620 --> 01:01.815
This device is
not on a timer.

01:01.860 --> 01:03.259
It's designed to be
detonated remotely,

01:03.290 --> 01:05.758
and since no one saw us enter,

01:05.790 --> 01:07.189
we're quite safe.

01:07.230 --> 01:09.323
That's funny,
I don't feel "quite safe."

01:14.400 --> 01:16.436
You know who's good with bombs?

01:16.470 --> 01:18.301
The bomb squad.
That's who we should call.

01:18.340 --> 01:20.137
We should not.
Beckoning the police

01:20.180 --> 01:22.239
would put the lives of our
neighbors at risk.

01:22.280 --> 01:24.202
Not to mention our
many belongings.

01:24.250 --> 01:27.139
We would also forfeit the
opportunity to gather any clues

01:27.180 --> 01:28.875
about the individual
who wants us dead.

01:28.920 --> 01:31.115
You say that like
we don't know who did this.

01:31.150 --> 01:32.412
Vikner did this obviously.

01:32.460 --> 01:34.257
He planted the same
kind of bomb

01:34.290 --> 01:35.655
that blew up
your father's office.

01:35.690 --> 01:38.454
Just a few hours ago,
he had a witness killed inside

01:38.490 --> 01:40.253
a police precinct.

01:40.300 --> 01:42.461
He did, but I think
we can rely on one thing,

01:42.500 --> 01:44.422
and that is that
he fears Moriarty.

01:44.470 --> 01:45.869
He has repeatedly implied

01:45.900 --> 01:48.198
that he runs her organization
through her good graces.

01:48.240 --> 01:49.207
So?

01:49.240 --> 01:50.639
So, she has but one rule:

01:50.670 --> 01:53.230
You and I are untouchable.

01:53.280 --> 01:54.269
(gasps)

01:56.450 --> 01:57.474
What just happened?

01:57.510 --> 01:59.319
I just disarmed the bomb.

01:59.350 --> 02:01.614
But you didn't pick a wire,
it was just...

02:01.650 --> 02:03.379
Despite the plots
of the many movies

02:03.420 --> 02:06.253
that you tell me are good,
which are in fact not good,

02:06.290 --> 02:08.212
bomb-makers don't build tests of
electrical engineering Skill,

02:08.260 --> 02:10.649
they build devices that go bang.

02:10.690 --> 02:12.157
The simpler the device,

02:12.200 --> 02:13.258
the more likely
it is to explode.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.291
This one would have had the
person across the street

02:15.330 --> 02:16.695
seen US enter.

02:16.730 --> 02:18.322
Speaking of
our would-be murderer,

02:18.370 --> 02:19.667
let's go introduce ourselves.

02:19.700 --> 02:20.689
*

02:37.490 --> 02:38.616
Did we just set off the alarm?

02:38.650 --> 02:41.551
It appears we did.

02:41.590 --> 02:44.479
So you're wrong.

02:44.530 --> 02:47.328
The person who planted the bomb
wasn't watching us from here.

02:47.360 --> 02:48.850
Someone was.

02:48.900 --> 02:50.697
I smell fresh cigarette smoke,

02:50.730 --> 02:51.958
and every shade is drawn
is except for that one.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.433
Can you imagine a better view

02:53.470 --> 02:55.233
of our front door
than from here?

02:55.270 --> 02:58.205
What kind of bomber turns
the alarm on before he leaves?

02:58.240 --> 02:59.275
You're assuming he has left.

02:59.310 --> 03:01.198
It's possible he found a way in

03:01.240 --> 03:02.571
that was not protected
by a sensor.

03:05.780 --> 03:08.442
There's no one here,
we should go.

03:08.480 --> 03:09.879
And we have about 15 seconds

03:09.920 --> 03:11.547
before that alarm goes
from beeping to blaring.

03:11.590 --> 03:13.410
(sighs)

03:13.460 --> 03:15.280
(keypad beeps, alarm stops)

03:17.390 --> 03:18.823
You just defused a bomb
two minutes ago,

03:18.860 --> 03:20.259
don't look so impressed.

03:20.300 --> 03:22.393
This is Joe and Colleen's place.

03:22.430 --> 03:24.398
I fed their fish last year
when they went on that cruise.

03:24.430 --> 03:25.988
Not the sort of _information
I retain.

03:26.030 --> 03:28.396
Yeah, well, one of us has to.

03:28.440 --> 03:29.668
We're here.

03:29.710 --> 03:30.836
We may as well
take a look around.

03:30.870 --> 03:33.873
(sighs)
You were right.

03:33.910 --> 03:36.549
Colleen and Joe have been out of
town for the last few days.

03:36.580 --> 03:37.842
He just texted me,

03:37.880 --> 03:39.518
and they did not hire
a house sitter.

03:39.550 --> 03:40.972
Yet someone sat right there,

03:41.020 --> 03:42.647
watching our home.

03:42.690 --> 03:43.884
Someone who smokes
clove Cigarettes.

03:43.920 --> 03:44.887
That's fresh?

03:44.920 --> 03:46.410
Mm-hmm.

03:46.460 --> 03:47.609
You want to tell _
me again why you think

03:47.660 --> 03:49.287
the person who just
tried to kill us

03:49.330 --> 03:50.683
does not work
for Joshua Vikner?

03:50.730 --> 03:51.628
Taking our lives

03:51.660 --> 03:52.752
would cost Vikner his own;
you know this.

03:52.800 --> 03:55.553
I mean, I get that there's
a rule against hurting us,

03:55.600 --> 03:57.261
but there are also rules
against extortion,

03:57.300 --> 03:58.528
war profiteering, and murder.

03:58.570 --> 03:59.730
I mean, if he's
willing to break those...

03:59.770 --> 04:01.328
If he crosses his predecessor,

04:01.370 --> 04:04.407
there is a 100% chance
he will be exsanguinated.

04:04.440 --> 04:06.374
The odds that we will
dig up proof against him

04:06.410 --> 04:09.868
are, in his estimation,
much less daunting.

04:09.910 --> 04:11.946
You think someone's
trying to frame him?

04:11.980 --> 04:13.743
Not just someone...

04:13.780 --> 04:15.418
someone inside his organization.

04:15.450 --> 04:17.338
The police know nothing
of Joshua Vikner,

04:17.390 --> 04:19.654
he's not a suspect in the
bombing of my father's office,

04:19.690 --> 04:21.908
and yet someone left
the exact same device

04:21.960 --> 04:23.587
in our home.

04:23.630 --> 04:25.655
Why?
For whose benefit?

04:25.690 --> 04:28.295
Moriarty's.

04:28.330 --> 04:31.766
Someone hopes to incite her
to Vikner's destruction.

04:31.800 --> 04:33.461
They failed.

04:33.500 --> 04:36.799
But we now know that there
is dissention in the ranks.

04:38.010 --> 04:39.409
We can use that
to our advantage.

04:39.440 --> 04:40.304
How?

04:40.340 --> 04:41.602
We find the dissenter.

04:41.640 --> 04:43.346
Propose an alliance.

04:43.380 --> 04:45.405
With the person who
just tried to blow us up?

04:45.450 --> 04:47.315
The enemy of my enemy, Watson.

04:47.350 --> 04:49.318
(phone rings)

04:52.360 --> 04:53.657
Marcus, hey.
It's late, what's up?

04:53.690 --> 04:54.918
Hey, is Sherlock with you?

04:54.960 --> 04:56.427
We're both here.

04:56.460 --> 04:57.620
You know a Christopher Gray,

04:57.660 --> 04:59.355
the head of
your dad's security detail?

04:59.400 --> 05:00.424
Yes.

05:00.460 --> 05:01.722
Did either of you
see him tonight?

05:01.760 --> 05:03.398
No, why?

05:03.430 --> 05:05.728
Couple of hours ago, he was
found unconscious on a sidewalk,

05:05.770 --> 05:07.431
just a few blocks
from your place.

05:07.470 --> 05:09.438
Someone busted him up
pretty good,

05:09.470 --> 05:10.300
so I called.

05:10.340 --> 05:12.399
You think he was mugged?
No, in addition

05:12.440 --> 05:13.407
to his wallet and watch,

05:13.440 --> 05:15.101
he had an unregistered
nine millimeter on him.

05:15.140 --> 05:16.471
Not sure how it ties

05:16.510 --> 05:17.875
to everything else
we've seen lately,

05:17.910 --> 05:18.979
but I'm gonna go
talk to the guy.

05:19.010 --> 05:21.808
He's at St. Bede's.
Thought you might want to join.

05:21.850 --> 05:23.408
We'll see you shortly.

05:25.150 --> 05:26.856
(monitor beeping)
TV WEATHERMAN:
Just out of the northwest,

05:26.890 --> 05:28.812
at seven miles per hour,
it's currently...

05:33.900 --> 05:35.390
I'm supposed to watch that.

05:35.430 --> 05:36.829
The concussion.

05:36.870 --> 05:38.622
They don't want me
falling asleep.

05:38.670 --> 05:40.661
Well, don't worry, Mr. Gray,
this conversation will be

05:40.700 --> 05:42.668
just as stimulating
as the weather report.

05:42.710 --> 05:44.439
What do you want?

05:44.470 --> 05:45.664
The man who put you here,

05:45.710 --> 05:46.870
he broke your clavicle,
your parietal bone,

05:46.910 --> 05:49.378
two of your ribs.
We want to find him.

05:49.410 --> 05:50.968
GRAY: I don't remember anything
since this morning.

05:51.010 --> 05:52.511
I can't help.

05:52.550 --> 05:54.108
WATSON:
Well, it says here that
you have suffered

05:54.150 --> 05:55.139
a significant head trauma,

05:55.180 --> 05:58.115
so that is possible,
but I doubt it.

05:58.150 --> 05:59.788
You were encamped in our
neighbor's apartment

05:59.820 --> 06:01.378
this evening;
you were spying on us.

06:01.420 --> 06:03.627
For a moment,
we thought you also

06:03.660 --> 06:05.150
put a bomb in our home,

06:05.190 --> 06:07.897
but then another more likely
scenario presented itself,

06:07.930 --> 06:09.693
one that would _account
for your many Injuries.

06:11.770 --> 06:13.692
I can't follow _
a word you're saying.

06:13.740 --> 06:14.889
I want you to leave.

06:14.940 --> 06:16.532
(call button beeps)

06:16.570 --> 06:19.573
You've been making eye contact
since we walked in.

06:19.610 --> 06:21.430
Your heart rate is going up;
you're lying.

06:21.480 --> 06:22.947
We're pretty sure
you don't need to.

06:22.980 --> 06:24.800
You've been spying on us
for Morland.

06:24.850 --> 06:26.545
He knows we've been keeping
things from him.

06:26.580 --> 06:28.468
The identity of his enemy,
for example.

06:28.520 --> 06:30.545
You found an empty
apartment, you set up shop.

06:30.590 --> 06:32.717
But tonight you saw a man
breaking into our house.

06:32.760 --> 06:34.716
When he left, you approached
him, there was a fight.

06:34.760 --> 06:36.182
He put you here.

06:36.220 --> 06:38.780
We came to thank you
for saving our lives.

06:38.830 --> 06:40.798
So just drop the charade...

06:40.830 --> 06:42.195
and tell us what
transpired tonight.

06:42.230 --> 06:44.767
I'm sorry...

06:44.800 --> 06:46.461
but I don't answer to you.

06:47.670 --> 06:49.865
I answer to your father.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.639
(door opens)

06:51.670 --> 06:53.171
Can I help you, Mr. Gray?

06:53.210 --> 06:55.030
I don't know who
these people are.

06:55.080 --> 06:56.479
They're bothering me.

06:56.510 --> 06:57.204
I'll call security.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.444
No, there's no need.

06:58.480 --> 07:00.141
Please, take good care of him.

07:00.180 --> 07:01.943
He's confused,
but he's a good man.

07:05.520 --> 07:06.145
You should stay here.

07:06.190 --> 07:07.680
Marcus will be here soon.

07:07.720 --> 07:08.982
It'll be conspicuous
if we're both absent.

07:09.020 --> 07:10.226
Where you going?

07:10.260 --> 07:11.557
There's a church
under renovation

07:11.590 --> 07:13.490
around the corner
from us on Quay.

07:13.530 --> 07:14.724
That's where they
picked him up.

07:14.760 --> 07:15.954
He had plaster dust

07:16.000 --> 07:17.490
on the shoulder of his coat.

07:17.530 --> 07:18.929
Perhaps that's where he
sustained the injuries

07:20.640 --> 07:22.130
I'll see if I can
pick up the trail there.

07:32.210 --> 07:33.211
(door shuts)

08:03.110 --> 08:05.476
*

08:14.620 --> 08:15.780
I didn't do it.

08:17.790 --> 08:19.929
I need to speak
to my son alone.

08:30.740 --> 08:32.605
Mr. Gray filled you in, did he?

08:32.640 --> 08:33.868
As I understand it,

08:33.910 --> 08:35.639
you should send him a gift.

08:37.810 --> 08:39.539
So I assume this is
the man who he stopped

08:39.580 --> 08:43.539
from detonating 15 gallons of
acetone peroxide solution

08:43.590 --> 08:47.788
inside your least valuable
real estate holding.

08:47.820 --> 08:49.583
The point, I believe,
was to kill you.

08:51.660 --> 08:53.196
There was a chase.

08:53.230 --> 08:56.597
The assassin tried to lose
Mr. Gray by ducking in here.

08:56.630 --> 08:58.097
Blows were exchanged.

08:58.130 --> 09:00.769
And then bullets.

09:00.800 --> 09:02.233
Why did you come here?

09:02.270 --> 09:03.305
It was on my way.

09:03.340 --> 09:04.136
Where?

09:04.170 --> 09:05.967
To you.

09:06.010 --> 09:07.329
I wanted to talk.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.177
If you're here
looking for identification,

09:09.210 --> 09:11.041
you won't find any.

09:11.080 --> 09:16.108
I just wanted to see his face
before my men dispose of him.

09:16.150 --> 09:18.618
Although, I confess I don't know
what I thought I could tell

09:18.650 --> 09:20.151
by looking at him.

09:20.190 --> 09:23.227
He's of Iranian descent,
between 37 and 42 years old.

09:23.260 --> 09:25.626
He's on blood pressure
medication and he enjoys

09:25.660 --> 09:26.695
racket sports.

09:26.730 --> 09:27.754
I could tell you
a lot about him,

09:27.800 --> 09:29.199
but the most important thing

09:29.230 --> 09:31.164
is that he did not work
for the same person

09:31.200 --> 09:32.758
who had your office bombed.

09:32.800 --> 09:35.189
You just said he planted
the same kind of device.

09:35.240 --> 09:37.128
And with very good reason.

09:37.170 --> 09:39.138
One I'm not inclined
to disclose at the moment.

09:42.140 --> 09:44.244
IfI had a white flag,
I would wave it.

09:44.280 --> 09:47.317
That's what I was
coming to tell you.

09:47.350 --> 09:49.011
I was wrong the other night.

09:49.050 --> 09:50.608
You were right.

09:50.650 --> 09:53.187
I didn't know what I was
up against; I do now.

09:53.220 --> 09:56.280
And I've decided not to waste
what remains of my life

09:56.320 --> 09:59.357
on some mad scramble
for vengeance.

09:59.390 --> 10:02.223
You expect me to believe
that your bloodlust has waned?

10:02.260 --> 10:06.094
I still want justice for Sabine.

10:06.130 --> 10:08.360
But there is a price
I am not willing to pay.

10:11.710 --> 10:14.873
I will not lose my son.

10:16.340 --> 10:19.309
I want to help you.

10:19.350 --> 10:22.808
You bested the head of this
organization once before.

10:22.850 --> 10:26.149
I will give anything in my power
to help you do it again.

10:26.190 --> 10:27.179
You have my word.

10:27.220 --> 10:29.051
We'll do it your way.

10:29.090 --> 10:30.955
Well, I know where to find you,

10:30.990 --> 10:32.890
should I decide
I need your help.

10:44.310 --> 10:45.231
Sherlock?

10:45.270 --> 10:47.636
In here.

10:49.140 --> 10:50.300
(sighs)

10:50.350 --> 10:51.146
You know what?

10:51.180 --> 10:53.171
I'd really like
to get rid of that.

10:53.220 --> 10:54.244
Promise I'll clean my room

10:54.280 --> 10:56.248
as soon as I've done
my homework.

10:56.280 --> 10:58.282
You found the bomber?

10:58.320 --> 11:00.185
Before and after his
meeting with Mr. Gray.

11:00.220 --> 11:02.313
As you can see,

11:02.360 --> 11:05.181
facial recognition sobeare
provided a match.

11:05.230 --> 11:07.721
He didn't maintain a_ social
media presence of hIs own.

11:07.760 --> 11:09.728
But according to his
bowling friends, his name

11:09.770 --> 11:11.226
is Nasim Behzadi.

11:11.270 --> 11:13.864
He was a driver
for Iran's U.N. Mission.

11:13.900 --> 11:16.266
Do you think he was taking
orders from someone in Tehran?

11:16.300 --> 11:17.904
I think they came
from someone more local.

11:17.940 --> 11:20.977
Iran has a woman working
at their U.N. Mission?

11:21.010 --> 11:22.272
Zoya Hashemi.

11:22.310 --> 11:24.005
She's the second
in command there.

11:24.050 --> 11:26.006
He was her personal driver.

11:26.050 --> 11:29.076
And she was responsible
for bringing him to the US.

11:29.120 --> 11:30.940
For her to get that job
in that government,

11:30.990 --> 11:33.049
she must be very smart
and very well-connected.

11:33.090 --> 11:34.887
It would make her
an ideal spoke in Vikner's

11:34.920 --> 11:38.083
wheels-within-wheels outfit,
don't you think?

11:38.130 --> 11:41.224
Why do you think she tired
to frame him for killing us?

11:41.260 --> 11:42.921
You think she wanted
to take over the group?

11:42.970 --> 11:44.267
Perhaps she grew tired
of participating

11:44.300 --> 11:46.268
in the cancerous web
of blackmail,

11:46.300 --> 11:50.236
market manipulation and homicide
that he maintains.

11:50.270 --> 11:52.204
The precise motive for
her attempt on our life

11:52.240 --> 11:54.174
can only be guessed
at, but I think

11:54.210 --> 11:56.906
she sent Mr. Behzadi
and his bomb.

11:56.950 --> 12:00.169
So, naturally,
we should befriend this lady.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.949
I'd like her to understand
there are other ways

12:01.980 --> 12:04.141
to deal with a problem
like Professor Vikner.

12:04.190 --> 12:06.215
Perhaps she can
provide the means.

12:06.250 --> 12:08.309
So how do we get to her?

12:08.360 --> 12:10.920
We can't just stroll into the
U.N. and introduce ourselves.

12:10.960 --> 12:12.257
My father offered
his assistance.

12:12.290 --> 12:14.497
I think we should accept.
You're kidding.

12:14.530 --> 12:17.328
He said he's willing to put his
quest for retribution on hold.

12:17.370 --> 12:19.019
You believed him?

12:19.070 --> 12:21.265
We're gonna need some help

12:21.300 --> 12:23.302
if we're to turn Ms. Hashemi.

12:25.170 --> 12:27.331
*

12:39.350 --> 12:41.159
This professor--

12:41.190 --> 12:43.249
what's he like in person?

12:43.290 --> 12:45.429
I'm sure you've been painting
a portrait of evil

12:45.460 --> 12:47.928
in your mind's eye
since Sabine's death,

12:47.960 --> 12:50.190
but it's really not like that.

12:50.230 --> 12:53.097
A closer approximate would be
Great Uncle Willard

12:53.140 --> 12:54.198
as a younger man.

12:57.870 --> 12:59.201
You haven't said
very much, Joan.

13:01.080 --> 13:02.570
You still don't trust me,
do you?

13:02.610 --> 13:04.146
No, I don't.

13:05.210 --> 13:06.404
So do you think your contacts

13:06.450 --> 13:07.940
in the region are sufficient

13:07.980 --> 13:09.345
to motivate Ms. Hashemi
to help us?

13:09.380 --> 13:12.884
This woman was
willing to kill you

13:12.920 --> 13:15.218
just to provoke
Vikner's removal.

13:15.260 --> 13:18.957
I don't think that motivation
will be the problem.

13:18.990 --> 13:22.255
The method
you're proposing...

13:22.300 --> 13:26.361
that's where we may
run into trouble.

13:45.320 --> 13:47.356
I was told Rixar Energy
was only sending

13:47.390 --> 13:49.381
two representatives today.

13:49.420 --> 13:51.422
Forgive us, Ms. Hashemi.

13:51.460 --> 13:53.951
My old friend George
may have given you

13:54.000 --> 13:55.399
some inacc_urate
Information

13:55.430 --> 13:58.024
about our party. Um...

13:58.070 --> 14:00.994
I do hope we can
still meet privately.

14:12.180 --> 14:14.341
(speaking native language)

14:17.420 --> 14:19.285
(door opens)

14:19.320 --> 14:20.958
(door closes)

14:20.990 --> 14:23.458
No reason for pretense,
I suppose.

14:23.490 --> 14:25.583
WATSON: We_ know
you're not religious.

14:25.630 --> 14:27.291
We've been
looking into you.

14:27.330 --> 14:29.355
What else have you learned?

14:29.400 --> 14:31.265
You're a murderous hag.

14:31.300 --> 14:32.324
Oh, good.

14:32.370 --> 14:34.998
We're going to be direct.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.439
In that case,
I suppose I should start

14:36.470 --> 14:37.960
by apologizing for having

14:38.010 --> 14:39.568
a bomb placed in your home.

14:39.610 --> 14:41.100
So you don't deny it?

14:41.140 --> 14:42.607
I don't have to, Ms. Watson.

14:42.640 --> 14:45.939
Such are the legal privileges
my position affords me.

14:45.980 --> 14:48.141
You came here
under false pretenses.

14:48.180 --> 14:50.182
There's no more need for lies.

14:50.220 --> 14:52.541
You want to talk about
Joshua Vikner, correct?

14:52.590 --> 14:54.251
So talk.

14:54.290 --> 14:56.212
SHERLOCK: We know why you tried
to kill us, Ms. Hashemi.

14:56.260 --> 14:59.582
The professor was a poor choice
to head up your cabal.

14:59.630 --> 15:01.598
He's reckless, undisciplined.

15:01.630 --> 15:04.098
We need a scalpel
in that position,

15:04.130 --> 15:06.189
not a hammer.

15:06.230 --> 15:08.994
And your skirmishes with him

15:09.040 --> 15:10.564
have drawn
too much attention.

15:10.610 --> 15:12.362
Are you tying to tell me you're
going to help me kill him?

15:12.410 --> 15:15.334
Murder's not on the table,
I'm afraid.

15:15.380 --> 15:17.405
We don't just want
the head of the snake.

15:17.450 --> 15:19.372
We _want the whole
slithering mass.

15:19.410 --> 15:21.344
We want to roll up
your entire organization.

15:21.380 --> 15:23.314
MORLAND:
Help us.

15:23.350 --> 15:25.045
Tell us everything you know,

15:25.090 --> 15:27.513
and I will personally
guarantee your safety.

15:27.560 --> 15:29.118
(wry, quiet laugh)

15:29.160 --> 15:30.684
You think you can just roll up

15:30.730 --> 15:33.358
what remains
of Moriarty's legacy?

15:33.400 --> 15:35.254
As I should've done long ago.

15:36.430 --> 15:39.024
If that's your plan, dear,

15:39.070 --> 15:42.289
there's something
you should see.

15:55.080 --> 15:56.377
Do you know what this is?

15:56.420 --> 15:57.546
Looks like you're tracking votes

15:57.590 --> 15:59.217
from U.N. members.

15:59.250 --> 16:02.048
Yes, but there's much
more to it than that.

16:02.090 --> 16:04.422
Everything in English
is for my staff's

16:04.460 --> 16:05.552
consumption.

16:05.590 --> 16:08.093
Everything in red is for me.

16:08.130 --> 16:09.324
The Persian script is in code.

16:09.360 --> 16:10.566
You won't crack it.

16:10.600 --> 16:12.295
The point is

16:12.330 --> 16:15.458
I want you to notice
the amount of red notations.

16:15.500 --> 16:18.060
They represent
recent activity

16:18.110 --> 16:20.271
of anothe global organization.

16:20.310 --> 16:23.245
You expect us to believe
that your group is active

16:23.280 --> 16:24.577
in almost half the countries
in the world?

16:24.610 --> 16:26.749
_ Sometimes it's
just an operative.

16:26.780 --> 16:28.748
_Sometimes it's a
mid-level bureaucrat

16:28.780 --> 16:30.486
being blackmailed,
or a financier.

16:30.520 --> 16:32.215
In certain domains,

16:32.250 --> 16:34.411
there's much more.

16:34.460 --> 16:36.314
The point is

16:36.360 --> 16:38.225
you can't just hope to roll up

16:38.260 --> 16:41.093
a network as large as this.

16:41.130 --> 16:42.449
Now, perhaps you see

16:42.500 --> 16:44.718
why I've acted
the way I have.

16:44.770 --> 16:47.295
Framing the professor with
your deaths was my only chance.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.296
I couldn't risk another.

16:49.340 --> 16:52.161
Who said you have a choice?

16:52.210 --> 16:54.531
We can expose you
to the Iranian government.

16:54.580 --> 16:56.730
Mr. Holmes,
there at least a dozen names

16:56.780 --> 16:59.271
on that board that I fear
more than my government.

16:59.310 --> 17:01.244
I have a family.

17:01.280 --> 17:03.214
And Joshua Vikner
will defend his position

17:03.250 --> 17:05.810
as furiously as he fought
to acquire it.

17:05.850 --> 17:08.182
We thought he just took over--
who'd he have to fight?

17:10.230 --> 17:12.323
If you won't help us,
maybe they will.

17:12.360 --> 17:14.191
You're assuming
they're still alive.

17:14.230 --> 17:17.119
As a matter of fact, he is.

17:18.430 --> 17:20.830
When Moriarty was captured...

17:20.870 --> 17:23.236
those with the most influence
in the group realized

17:23.270 --> 17:26.330
that we couldn't continue on
without a leader.

17:26.370 --> 17:28.179
We were, as you said,

17:28.210 --> 17:30.474
the snake, and we were
eating our own tail.

17:30.510 --> 17:32.501
Certain candidates emerged--
Vikner among them.

17:32.550 --> 17:34.643
But others, like myself,

17:34.680 --> 17:37.649
advocated for an individual
outside the group.

17:40.490 --> 17:42.481
A legend.

17:42.520 --> 17:44.454
He'd spent a lifetime
playing dice with the globe,

17:44.490 --> 17:45.718
and had profited

17:45.760 --> 17:47.193
immensely.

17:47.230 --> 17:49.551
He still does.

17:49.600 --> 17:52.489
She's talking about you.

17:52.530 --> 17:55.328
They wanted you to lead them.

17:55.370 --> 17:57.338
MS. HASHEMI:
Tell me you don't see

17:57.370 --> 17:58.530
art in what we do.

17:58.570 --> 17:59.798
Tell me

17:59.840 --> 18:01.535
you couldn't
have perfected it.

18:01.580 --> 18:03.639
WATSON: That's why Vikner
tried to have him killed

18:03.680 --> 18:05.375
back then--
because he was in the way?

18:05.410 --> 18:07.412
He had to go.
Only he didn't go.

18:07.450 --> 18:08.439
He was only wounded.

18:08.480 --> 18:10.414
He lost a lover as well.

18:10.450 --> 18:11.781
It gave Vikner
the time he needed

18:11.820 --> 18:14.584
to solidify his position.

18:14.620 --> 18:16.258
I'm sorry.

18:16.290 --> 18:18.281
You wish my help.

18:18.330 --> 18:20.218
But you're living proof
of what happens

18:20.260 --> 18:23.297
when he perceives
a threat to his power.

18:30.570 --> 18:32.299
Are you smiling?

18:32.340 --> 18:33.739
How often do you learn
so much so quickly?

18:33.780 --> 18:35.372
It's invigorating.

18:35.410 --> 18:37.344
Taken in total,
the situation is quite daunting.

18:37.380 --> 18:39.348
But we can crawl
before we must run.

18:39.380 --> 18:40.608
What does that mean?

18:40.650 --> 18:42.538
Ms. Hashemi,
she had the right idea.

18:42.580 --> 18:44.719
I object to her choice
of targets, obviously,

18:44.750 --> 18:46.342
but it makes sense.

18:46.390 --> 18:47.459
What does?

18:47.490 --> 18:48.912
We want to defeat
Joshua Vikner.

18:48.960 --> 18:50.723
A way to do so has just
been made quite plain.

18:50.760 --> 18:51.749
We're gonna frame him
for murder.

19:12.550 --> 19:14.916
I think I found something.

19:14.950 --> 19:16.872
Lance Chapel.

19:16.920 --> 19:18.683
Psycho Cinco.

19:18.720 --> 19:20.551
I've repeatedly asked
you not to call him that.

19:20.590 --> 19:21.488
It's late.

19:21.520 --> 19:23.681
I can call the crazy people
whatever I want.

19:23.730 --> 19:25.550
December 16 of 2012,

19:25.590 --> 19:27.592
there was a suspicious fire
in his apartment building.

19:27.630 --> 19:29.621
An old married couple
was killed.

19:29.660 --> 19:31.491
He was questioned because they
had gotten into an argument

19:31.530 --> 19:32.861
a few days before.

19:32.900 --> 19:34.697
Says here the Hofmanns
were difficult tenants--

19:34.740 --> 19:37.231
nosy, the keepers
of dozens of cats.

19:37.270 --> 19:38.931
Got into arguments
with lots of their neighbors.

19:38.970 --> 19:40.870
Right,
but how many of them

19:40.910 --> 19:42.832
do you suppose took
the DANTE survey in 2015,

19:42.880 --> 19:44.848
and got outed as a psychopath?

19:44.880 --> 19:46.700
Says here he was
in a conference in Tokyo

19:46.750 --> 19:47.910
on the night of the 16th.

19:47.950 --> 19:49.838
We made those calendars

19:49.880 --> 19:51.916
based on where the Internet
said Vikner had been.

19:51.950 --> 19:54.214
So?
_ So the Internet
is not always right.

19:54.260 --> 19:55.909
It says here
that photos were taken.

19:55.960 --> 19:57.518
This is your handwriting.

19:57.560 --> 20:00.222
You can't frame him
for the fire.

20:00.260 --> 20:02.524
Maybe if we were not
limiting ourselves to crimes

20:02.560 --> 20:04.562
we think were committed
by the DANTE psychos...

20:04.600 --> 20:06.727
Do you disagree with the notion
that they committed heinous acts

20:06.770 --> 20:09.238
before they were identified
by the survey?

20:09.270 --> 20:11.568
Of course not,
I just accused Chapel of arson.

20:11.610 --> 20:12.861
We now know that four
of these people are dead,

20:12.910 --> 20:14.434
and two of them are
already in prison.

20:14.480 --> 20:15.538
Their fates are sealed.

20:17.610 --> 20:19.976
We stick to the psychopaths.

20:25.620 --> 20:26.882
Do you think Morland
would've said yes

20:26.920 --> 20:28.717
to the offer
to take over the group?

20:31.630 --> 20:33.791
There's no denying that over
his long and storied career,

20:33.830 --> 20:35.718
my father has facilitated
business deals

20:35.760 --> 20:38.729
where death was a likely outcome
for someone, somewhere.

20:38.770 --> 20:40.431
But Vikner and his people,

20:40.470 --> 20:42.893
they pursue death
as a business deal.

20:42.940 --> 20:46.967
It's a difference of kind,
not of degree.

20:47.010 --> 20:49.774
It makes the murder of Sabine
Raoult all the more pointless.

20:49.810 --> 20:51.903
My father was
never a threat

20:51.950 --> 20:55.613
to Vikner's ascendency...

20:57.850 --> 20:59.681
Did you
find something?

20:59.720 --> 21:02.609
Where's the calendar for 2013?

21:02.660 --> 21:04.878
Kitchen-- I brought it down
there when I made my dinner.

21:11.030 --> 21:12.827
WATSON:
What is it?

21:12.870 --> 21:15.668
Arthur Tetch, one of our two
incarcerated psychopaths.

21:15.700 --> 21:17.509
On April 3, 2013,

21:17.540 --> 21:19.599
a young woman from his
neighborhood went missing--

21:19.640 --> 21:21.301
Autumn Dunbar.

21:21.340 --> 21:23.308
Two weeks later,
she was found,

21:23.350 --> 21:24.544
miles away, slashed to ribbons

21:24.580 --> 21:27.310
in a parking structure
in Harlem.

21:27.350 --> 21:29.818
It was obvious to the police
that she'd been held somewhere.

21:29.850 --> 21:31.784
Tortured.

21:31.820 --> 21:33.788
The theory was
that she had escaped,

21:33.820 --> 21:36.584
only to be pursued
and then killed by her captor.

21:36.620 --> 21:37.826
Note the bit about her clothes.

21:37.860 --> 21:41.057
CSU found traces
of sodium borate.

21:43.730 --> 21:45.766
So the police thought that
she'd been held in a room

21:45.800 --> 21:47.631
which contained
cleaning supplies.

21:47.670 --> 21:50.798
But borax is also_
a preservative used in...

21:50.840 --> 21:53.877
Taxidermy, which is how
Arthur Tetch made his living.

21:53.910 --> 21:55.707
He had a store in Harlem.

21:55.740 --> 21:58.709
Yeah, he moved not one month
after Autumn's murder.

21:58.750 --> 22:00.342
Perhaps to put some distance

22:00.380 --> 22:01.779
between himself
and the place that he held her.

22:01.820 --> 22:03.685
Some more good news.

22:03.720 --> 22:06.518
Joshua Vikner was in New York
the night she went missing

22:06.550 --> 22:08.086
and the night
her throat was slashed.

22:08.120 --> 22:10.520
Okay, so we have a murder
that we're pretty sure

22:10.560 --> 22:12.528
was committed by Arthur Tetch
and it fits our timetable.

22:12.560 --> 22:15.495
How are we gonna
pin that to Viktor?
Produce a murder weapon.

22:15.530 --> 22:17.896
You seriously think that Tetch
held onto that knife he used?

22:17.930 --> 22:19.488
No, you misunderstand.

22:19.530 --> 22:21.532
We literally produce
a murder weapon.

22:21.570 --> 22:24.539
The right kind of blade can be
procured at any hardware store.

22:24.570 --> 22:26.504
Samples of Autumn Dunbar's blood

22:26.540 --> 22:28.508
were preserved
at several crime labs.

22:28.540 --> 22:30.508
I'll find out which one has
the weakest security,

22:30.550 --> 22:32.370
and I'll pay them
a visit before morning.

22:32.410 --> 22:34.571
Then what? We just stash
the knife at Vikner's office

22:34.620 --> 22:36.576
and then call a tip in
to the police?

22:38.050 --> 22:40.018
I want the murder weapon
to speak for itself.

22:40.050 --> 22:42.018
As well as
Autumn Dunbar's blood,

22:42.060 --> 22:44.483
I want some evidence which
ties it directly to Vikner.

22:44.530 --> 22:45.883
Okay, so how are you
gonna get that?

22:45.930 --> 22:47.659
I'm not. You are.

22:49.560 --> 22:52.927
Our world only gets more
dangerous; it's a fact.

22:52.970 --> 22:55.564
But that danger
forces us to think,

22:58.710 --> 23:00.803
In the case of South Sudan,

23:00.840 --> 23:03.707
attacks on hospitals
and food banks

23:03.750 --> 23:05.149
have driven population groups

23:05.180 --> 23:07.148
(phone ringing)
out of city centers.

23:07.180 --> 23:09.148
I see that someone's
forgotten my rule

23:09.180 --> 23:11.978
about phones in the classroom.

23:12.020 --> 23:14.011
(ringing continues)

23:19.230 --> 23:21.596
(ringing continues)
I think you want to take this.

23:23.130 --> 23:25.098
Excuse me a moment, will you?

23:25.130 --> 23:27.121
I'll be right back.

23:29.540 --> 23:31.531
(ringing continues)

23:31.570 --> 23:33.037
(students murmuring)

23:35.080 --> 23:37.071
(ringing continues)

23:45.090 --> 23:46.887
Hello?

23:46.920 --> 23:49.912
MORLAND: Professor Vikner,
this is Morland Holmes.

23:51.730 --> 23:54.119
Mr. Holmes, this is an honor.

23:54.160 --> 23:56.526
I've followed your career
with great...

23:56.560 --> 24:00.963
This conversation is not being
recorded, if that's of concern.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.831
Why would you record
a conversation

24:02.870 --> 24:04.531
with a perfect stranger?

24:04.570 --> 24:06.538
You prefer we speak
in hypotheticals.

24:06.570 --> 24:08.538
Very well.

24:08.580 --> 24:12.846
Hypothetically, I've called
to take you up on your offer.

24:12.880 --> 24:14.677
What offer?

24:14.720 --> 24:17.541
The one you proposed
to my son the other day.

24:17.590 --> 24:20.957
You thought a peace could
be brokered between us.

24:20.990 --> 24:23.254
Your son_ said that
was qUIte imp055ible.

24:23.290 --> 24:25.679
He was mistaken.

24:25.730 --> 24:27.789
It's been known to happen.

24:27.830 --> 24:30.196
Well, not the way I've heard it.

24:30.230 --> 24:32.596
I'm afraid the offer
you're referring to

24:32.630 --> 24:34.234
is no longer on the table.

24:34.270 --> 24:36.067
And why is that?

24:36.100 --> 24:38.068
These past few months,
you've raised a ruckus,

24:38.110 --> 24:40.066
I've had to raise one in return.

24:40.110 --> 24:43.079
I've finally drawn the attention
of the people I oversee.

24:43.110 --> 24:44.907
Some want it to stop.

24:44.950 --> 24:47.544
More than a few think
I've gone too easy on you.

24:47.580 --> 24:51.539
Mm, they should visit
my New York office.

24:51.590 --> 24:54.184
At this point, I can think
of only one thing

24:54.220 --> 24:56.859
that will guarantee peace.

24:56.890 --> 24:59.256
Your head on a pike.

24:59.290 --> 25:01.258
Hypothetically speaking,
of course.

25:01.300 --> 25:03.188
Of course.

25:03.230 --> 25:05.664
If you're prepared to make
that kind of sacrifice

25:05.700 --> 25:08.669
for the sake of your business,
your family, your legacy,

25:08.700 --> 25:10.099
you let me know.

25:10.140 --> 25:12.062
I'll send a car.

25:12.110 --> 25:14.704
We'll work out the details
face-to-face.

25:21.020 --> 25:23.648
Are you sure you
don't want to stay?

25:25.820 --> 25:27.811
You may learn something.

25:45.370 --> 25:47.804
Gonna do Vikner's work
for him, and jump?

25:50.180 --> 25:52.148
Despite how you might feel,
that actually went quite well.

25:52.180 --> 25:54.114
We should have
what we need.

25:54.150 --> 25:56.118
Vikner's fingerprints.

25:56.150 --> 25:58.118
On the phone
Watson gave him.

25:58.150 --> 26:00.311
She coated it with a special
residue this morning--

26:00.350 --> 26:01.578
a concoction of my own design,

26:01.620 --> 26:03.349
to make sure that they stuck.

26:03.390 --> 26:05.620
We'll then transfer them
to the knife we procured,

26:05.660 --> 26:07.594
along with some
of Autumn Dunbar's blood.

26:07.630 --> 26:10.599
Then send it to your friends
at the police department.

26:10.630 --> 26:13.838
No, lying to the captain
is one thing.

26:13.870 --> 26:16.236
Making him complicit in
a frame-up is quite another.

26:16.270 --> 26:19.239
We'll be sending
the knife to the FBI.

26:19.270 --> 26:21.079
Wat_son has
an acquaintance there,

26:21.110 --> 26:22.702
an agent by the name
of Burke.

26:22.740 --> 26:25.743
He's a good man, but he's not
a bridge that we can't burn.

26:25.780 --> 26:28.374
And as luck would have it, at
the time of her disappearance,

26:28.420 --> 26:30.376
Autumn Dunbar was working
as a window clerk

26:30.420 --> 26:31.785
for the United States
Postal Service.

26:31.820 --> 26:34.209
That makes
her case federal.

26:34.260 --> 26:38.378
I'm sure the Bureau will be
quite happy with the new lead.

26:38.430 --> 26:40.625
I appreciate what
you're doing.

26:40.660 --> 26:42.696
I know how you work.

26:42.730 --> 26:44.891
Falsifying evidence
can't sit well with you.

26:44.930 --> 26:47.319
Desperate times.

26:47.370 --> 26:50.191
Sometimes you have to bite
the orange in order to peel it.

26:52.210 --> 26:54.201
Our plan's not what's
troubling you though, is it?

26:56.240 --> 26:59.038
It's really something,

26:59.080 --> 27:03.642
realizing that you are,
for all appearances,

27:03.690 --> 27:06.682
the kind of man who would accept
the leadership position

27:06.720 --> 27:08.711
in a group like that.

27:09.760 --> 27:10.749
I've always blamed myself

27:10.790 --> 27:12.189
for what happened to Sabine.

27:12.230 --> 27:15.427
I was sure I'd done something

27:15.460 --> 27:16.893
to upset a competitor

27:16.930 --> 27:19.990
or acted too aggressively
in a negotiation,

27:20.030 --> 27:23.830
angered the wrong
dictator or CEO.

27:23.870 --> 27:27.829
I'd stay up at night, struggling
to put a finger on it,

27:27.880 --> 27:30.849
to figure out exactly
what I'd done wrong.

27:30.880 --> 27:32.905
HOLMES: Right, 'cause it
wasn't one thing, was it?

27:32.950 --> 27:34.918
It was everything.

27:34.950 --> 27:36.349
Your life's work.

27:43.460 --> 27:46.452
You would have been a
spectacular failure, by the way.

27:46.490 --> 27:51.291
You don't have the stuff
to be an evil mastermind.

27:56.840 --> 27:58.398
WATSON: Hey.
HOLMES: Anything?

27:58.440 --> 27:59.998
I'm being taken
to Gary right now.

28:00.040 --> 28:01.439
HOLMES: I assumed he would
only contact you

28:01.480 --> 28:03.471
after a suspect was apprehended,

28:03.510 --> 28:05.171
but there's been no mention
of Vikner's arrest in the news.

28:05.210 --> 28:06.370
I don't think
they've arrested him yet.

28:06.410 --> 28:07.911
He just said there was
a new development

28:07.950 --> 28:09.372
he wanted to talk about.

28:09.420 --> 28:11.012
You're sure that he believed you
when you said

28:11.050 --> 28:13.018
we found the knife at the bottom
of an elevator shaft?

28:13.050 --> 28:14.449
In the parking structure where
Autumn Dunbar was killed.

28:14.490 --> 28:15.912
Yes, I'm sure.

28:15.960 --> 28:17.928
He said he'd put
a rush on it at the lab.

28:17.960 --> 28:19.382
I'll be in touch.

28:21.400 --> 28:23.766
Joan... sorry
for the wait.

28:23.800 --> 28:25.392
No problem.
What's up?

28:25.430 --> 28:26.397
Can we talk in my office?

28:26.430 --> 28:27.419
Sure.

28:30.970 --> 28:33.939
So, uh...

28:33.980 --> 28:36.369
the knife that you brought us--
you were right,

28:36.410 --> 28:38.844
the blood is a match
for Autumn Dunbar.

28:38.880 --> 28:42.247
And we were able _to lift
a clean set of prints

28:42.280 --> 28:45.488
that matches the suspect
you like, Joshua Vikner.

28:45.520 --> 28:46.919
That's great.

28:46.950 --> 28:48.759
You said your partner
took this case

28:48.790 --> 28:50.212
because he was bored?

28:50.260 --> 28:52.751
It happens sometimes.

28:52.790 --> 28:54.394
Did either one of you
tell anyone else

28:54.430 --> 28:55.397
about finding the knife?

28:55.430 --> 28:57.762
No. Why? What's going on?

28:57.800 --> 29:00.769
Well, a few hours ago,
we went to look for Vikner,

29:00.800 --> 29:02.267
and he's gone.

29:02.300 --> 29:05.167
He's not at his house,
not at his office.

29:05.210 --> 29:07.007
He hasn't shown up
for classes today.

29:07.040 --> 29:09.008
His friends, his colleagues,
they haven't heard from him.

29:09.040 --> 29:11.474
His phone's off, his credit
cards haven't been used.

29:11.510 --> 29:15.947
So we've got a three-year-old
cold case here,

29:15.980 --> 29:20.212
and this guy chooses this exact
moment to go off the grid?

29:20.250 --> 29:22.411
You think someone
tipped him off.

29:22.460 --> 29:24.428
Joan, if you didn't
tell anyone,

29:24.460 --> 29:27.952
I wonder if somebody inside
the Bureau tipped him off.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.390
Now, we'll take it
from here,

29:31.430 --> 29:33.569
but in the meantime,
do me a favor.

29:33.600 --> 29:37.161
Please be careful.

29:37.200 --> 29:38.201
I'm worried there's more
to this guy than meets the eye.

29:48.850 --> 29:50.818
Sir?

29:50.850 --> 29:52.818
Your son just called
on the secure line.

29:52.850 --> 29:54.818
He's coming over.

29:54.860 --> 29:56.987
Did he say why?
No, sir.

29:57.020 --> 29:58.988
But he did say we should
bring on more people

29:59.030 --> 30:01.351
for the next few hours.

30:01.400 --> 30:04.028
He also suggested
that we ready your plane.

30:05.300 --> 30:06.494
I see.

30:18.310 --> 30:22.872
IfI had raised an optimist,
you'd be here crowing.

30:22.920 --> 30:24.842
Vikner's on the run.

30:24.890 --> 30:26.039
I'm not an optimist.

30:26.090 --> 30:27.443
Neither are you.

30:27.490 --> 30:29.879
I see both sides.

30:31.890 --> 30:34.893
Clearly Vikner's FBI sources
have convinced him

30:34.930 --> 30:36.921
that the threat
you posed was serious--

30:36.960 --> 30:39.861
upending one's life,
becoming a fugitive--

30:39.900 --> 30:42.061
drastic steps
for a public figure.

30:42.100 --> 30:43.863
It was necessary.

30:43.910 --> 30:45.866
He won't easily shrug off
Autumn Dunbar's murder,

30:45.910 --> 30:48.879
and this will do little to quiet
the dissent in his ranks.

30:48.910 --> 30:50.434
And that's the end
of the good news.

30:50.480 --> 30:54.871
Now he's a wounded animal,
striking out from the shadows.

30:57.380 --> 31:00.986
He'll have to show strength,
make an example of you.

31:01.020 --> 31:03.989
Not me. Perhaps you should
return to London,

31:04.030 --> 31:05.588
where you're better protected.

31:05.630 --> 31:08.349
Isn't that what he'd expect?
Well, if you prefer,

31:08.400 --> 31:10.049
there's whatever Greek island
Mycroft is languishing on.

31:10.100 --> 31:12.967
I always imagined that
you had a secret lair

31:13.000 --> 31:14.365
beneath a volcano
for such an occa5ion.

31:14.400 --> 31:16.368
I'll be gone in the morning.

31:16.400 --> 31:17.560
This matter will be resolved.

31:17.600 --> 31:18.999
Watson and I will see to it.

31:19.040 --> 31:21.008
Of that I have no doubt.

31:21.040 --> 31:23.031
Thank you, son.

31:26.280 --> 31:28.271
*

31:34.960 --> 31:36.951
(phone clicks)

31:41.330 --> 31:44.299
It's Morland Holmes.

31:44.330 --> 31:47.026
The other day,
you made me an offer.

31:48.400 --> 31:50.960
I've decided to accept it.

31:53.170 --> 31:54.933
Here you are.

31:54.980 --> 31:57.198
You disappeared on me.

31:57.240 --> 31:59.299
Vanishing men.
It's an epidemic.

31:59.350 --> 32:00.703
I think I passed
out around 4:00.

32:00.750 --> 32:01.944
Last thing

32:01.980 --> 32:03.242
I remember, you were looking

32:03.280 --> 32:04.508
at Vikner's financials.

32:04.550 --> 32:06.108
A dry well.

32:06.150 --> 32:07.185
He must be using some heretofore

32:07.220 --> 32:08.619
unidentified slush fund

32:08.660 --> 32:10.355
to finance his
flight from justice.

32:10.390 --> 32:12.529
While you slept,
I discarded several other

32:12.560 --> 32:13.993
possible ways to locate him.

32:14.030 --> 32:16.590
No clues in his books
about where he'd go?

32:16.630 --> 32:18.268
His case studies
draw exten5ively

32:18.300 --> 32:19.995
from field research,
but he's too well-traveled

32:20.030 --> 32:22.339
to pin down, not
even to a favorite

32:22.370 --> 32:23.462
conﬁnent

32:23.500 --> 32:25.309
The next notion I entertained

32:25.340 --> 32:27.001
hinged on the hope
that he still

32:27.040 --> 32:28.007
maintains an interest

32:28.040 --> 32:29.007
in his biological daughter.

32:29.040 --> 32:30.530
Tell me you weren't thinking

32:30.580 --> 32:32.445
about kidnapping her
to lure him out of hiding.

32:32.480 --> 32:33.970
I didn't think
about it for very long.

32:34.020 --> 32:35.544
Look, Vikner is
a wanted man now.

32:35.580 --> 32:37.548
He can't operate
the way he used to.

32:37.580 --> 32:39.343
Maybe that has to
be enough this time.

32:39.390 --> 32:41.381
Do you think this group can't
be run from somewhere else?

32:41.420 --> 32:42.614
Do you think he's less

32:42.660 --> 32:43.979
dangerous now he's on the run?

32:44.030 --> 32:45.019
Of course not, I just don't want

32:45.060 --> 32:46.288
to keep lying to our friends.

32:46.330 --> 32:47.649
We can't afford to worry
about the authorities.

32:47.690 --> 32:50.124
You saw how big this network is.

32:50.160 --> 32:51.764
How do you really
think this ends?

32:51.800 --> 32:53.995
(doorbell rings)

32:57.400 --> 32:58.537
Mr. Gray.

32:58.570 --> 33:00.003
May I come in?

33:02.480 --> 33:04.004
What are you doing
out of the hospital?

33:04.050 --> 33:05.779
You should still be
under observation.

33:05.810 --> 33:07.607
Oh, I'm fine.
I'll be fine.

33:07.650 --> 33:08.776
I'm looking for your father.

33:08.820 --> 33:10.776
I haven't been able

33:10.820 --> 33:12.617
to track him down anywhere.

33:12.650 --> 33:13.742
HOLMES:
He's travelling today.

33:13.790 --> 33:15.553
GRAY:
I don't think so.

33:17.160 --> 33:20.379
I got this letter by courier,
just a little while ago,

33:20.430 --> 33:21.749
and the man who
delivered it to me

33:21.800 --> 33:23.597
said that he stood by

33:23.630 --> 33:25.427
and watched your
father write it.

33:25.470 --> 33:27.222
You seem upset.

33:27.270 --> 33:28.589
GRAY:
I've been the head

33:28.640 --> 33:30.164
of his security detail
for 20 years.

33:30.200 --> 33:32.703
He just terminated
my employment,

33:32.740 --> 33:34.571
and I don't understand why.

33:34.610 --> 33:36.601
If it's about
the other night, I-I

33:36.640 --> 33:37.800
was following orders.

33:37.840 --> 33:39.603
He told you to shoot that man?

33:39.650 --> 33:41.572
No, I-I-I had to defend myself.

33:41.620 --> 33:42.678
If it upset him...

33:42.720 --> 33:43.778
It doesn't appear that you did.

33:43.820 --> 33:45.344
10 million

33:45.390 --> 33:47.244
severance is quite generous,
isn't it?

33:47.290 --> 33:49.349
It was too generous.

33:49.390 --> 33:52.689
Your father has already been
very good to me, to my family.

33:52.730 --> 33:55.051
Whatever I did,
I want to apologize.

33:55.100 --> 33:57.523
I want to make a case for
keeping the other men on.

33:57.560 --> 33:59.096
The other men?

33:59.130 --> 34:01.462
GRAY:
He terminated his entire team

34:01.500 --> 34:03.058
this morning.

34:03.100 --> 34:05.466
He said he didn't
need us any longer.

34:05.510 --> 34:07.705
He said the
danger had passed.

34:13.350 --> 34:14.749
You asked how this ends.

34:14.780 --> 34:15.769
I think my father

34:15.820 --> 34:17.469
has a solution in mind.

34:17.520 --> 34:19.112
WATSON: He's giving himself
up to Vikner.

34:19.150 --> 34:21.482
(phone buzzing)

34:53.790 --> 34:56.509
Thank you for coming,
Mr. Holmes.

35:07.300 --> 35:08.289
HOLMES:
No, you're not listening to me!

35:08.340 --> 35:09.295
I...

35:09.340 --> 35:10.568
(grunts)

35:10.600 --> 35:12.363
No luck at Zoya
Hashemi's office?

35:12.410 --> 35:14.298
I'd hoped to use every
ounce of leverage we have

35:14.340 --> 35:16.171
to get her to look into
Vikner's possible whereabouts,

35:16.210 --> 35:17.529
but her people won't
even connect me.

35:17.580 --> 35:19.343
I tried to call
Morland's London office.

35:19.380 --> 35:20.642
They claim they can't reach him.

35:20.680 --> 35:22.238
We can't be sure
he's giving himself up.

35:22.280 --> 35:24.316
If there's another reason
for him severing ties

35:24.350 --> 35:26.318
with his entire security team,
I'd like to hear it.

35:29.290 --> 35:30.484
Gary?

35:30.520 --> 35:32.420
We got a hit on
Vikner's cell phone.

35:32.460 --> 35:33.882
You're kidding.

35:33.930 --> 35:36.398
Right now, it's pinging
three towers in Yonkers.

35:36.430 --> 35:38.591
Looks like he's holed up
in an abandoned power plant

35:38.630 --> 35:40.222
at Ravine and Glenwood.

35:40.270 --> 35:41.237
I've got a SWAT unit en route.

35:41.270 --> 35:42.259
We'll meet you there,

35:42.300 --> 35:43.562
just tell your
guys be careful.

35:43.600 --> 35:45.409
He could have
a hostage with him.

35:45.440 --> 35:47.431
(sirens wailing)

35:51.450 --> 35:53.179
This is an active scene,
you two got to stay back.

35:53.210 --> 35:54.313
Agent Burke!

35:54.350 --> 35:55.612
You can't be here.
Joan Watson.

35:55.650 --> 35:57.447
This is Sherlock Holmes,
we're with the NYPD.

35:57.480 --> 35:59.710
It's all right,
they're with me.

35:59.750 --> 36:01.308
We're just arriving.

36:01.360 --> 36:02.759
We're still sweeping
the facility.

36:02.790 --> 36:04.485
I don't see any vehicles.

36:04.530 --> 36:06.327
We think Vikner took off.

36:06.360 --> 36:07.782
His phone's still pinging.

36:07.830 --> 36:09.388
It's hard to get
an accurate read.

36:09.430 --> 36:10.624
This concrete,

36:10.660 --> 36:12.366
it's playing havoc
with all our signals.

36:13.700 --> 36:16.237
Why would this guy
drag us out here, Joan?

36:16.270 --> 36:17.294
You said you
thought he might have

36:17.340 --> 36:18.466
a hostage.

36:18.510 --> 36:20.307
Another girl or what?

36:20.340 --> 36:21.375
MAN: ...ody here.

36:21.410 --> 36:22.968
Say again, team leader.

36:23.010 --> 36:24.807
I said, we got a body here.

36:24.850 --> 36:26.408
Let's get inside.

36:41.900 --> 36:43.253
BURKE:
What do we got?

36:46.430 --> 36:47.692
Whoa.

36:49.300 --> 36:50.995
Is it self-inflicted?

36:51.040 --> 36:52.359
FBI AGENT:
I don't think so.

36:52.410 --> 36:53.900
There's no gun.

36:59.410 --> 37:01.412
(phone buzzes)

37:24.440 --> 37:27.705
They stay here even during
winter, do they not?

37:27.740 --> 37:28.900
Excuse me?

37:28.940 --> 37:30.908
The bees.

37:30.940 --> 37:32.942
This is their home...

37:32.980 --> 37:35.448
rain or shine.

37:35.480 --> 37:38.415
Yes, let's talk about bees,

37:38.450 --> 37:40.884
instead of the execution you
just carried out in Yonkers.

37:45.060 --> 37:47.927
I didn't lay a finger
on Professor Vikner.

37:47.960 --> 37:49.325
Who did?

37:49.360 --> 37:52.022
Associates of a new friend.

37:52.070 --> 37:54.891
Ms. Hashemi.

37:57.740 --> 38:00.766
After our meeting the other day,
she contacted me,

38:00.810 --> 38:05.349
and said she wanted to offer
her assistance, after all.

38:05.380 --> 38:07.701
We wanted her help in
putting Vikner in prison.

38:07.750 --> 38:10.014
She had a different plan.

38:10.050 --> 38:12.018
So she baited the trap,
she drew him out,

38:12.050 --> 38:14.314
and now she ascends
to his throne.

38:14.360 --> 38:17.682
Actually, Ms. Hashemi

38:17.720 --> 38:19.859
is not taking Vikner's place.

38:21.560 --> 38:22.595
Iam.

38:22.630 --> 38:24.359
What?

38:24.400 --> 38:25.389
Her idea.

38:25.430 --> 38:27.591
That Vikner goes away

38:27.630 --> 38:30.360
and she gets what she's
wanted for several years.

38:32.410 --> 38:34.799
A steadier hand
at the wheel of the group.

38:34.840 --> 38:36.330
You know, you haven't
told a joke

38:36.380 --> 38:38.371
in the four decades
I've known you.

38:38.410 --> 38:39.843
Better late than never,
I suppose.

38:39.880 --> 38:41.416
I did it for you, Sherlock.

38:42.720 --> 38:44.039
You and Joan.

38:45.890 --> 38:48.484
It was the only way to
guarantee they'd never harm you.

38:48.520 --> 38:49.782
Well, there's a rule in place

38:49.820 --> 38:50.787
established by
the group's founder.

38:50.820 --> 38:52.879
Didn't stop a bomb

38:52.930 --> 38:54.397
from appearing at your house

38:54.430 --> 38:55.419
the other night, did it?

38:55.460 --> 38:57.098
I told you.

38:57.130 --> 39:01.021
I will not lose my son.

39:01.070 --> 39:03.834
So, you're only recourse
was to become head

39:03.870 --> 39:05.906
of an organization
which murders for profit.

39:05.940 --> 39:08.374
How else would I dismantle it?

39:10.110 --> 39:13.102
Ms. Hashemi was right.

39:13.150 --> 39:15.448
The group is
virtually impervious

39:15.480 --> 39:17.471
to threats from the outside...

39:18.550 --> 39:20.415
but a threat from the inside,

39:20.450 --> 39:21.610
on the other hand...

39:21.660 --> 39:23.878
What you're describing
would be suicide.

39:23.920 --> 39:26.889
I should be returning
to London this evening.

39:28.660 --> 39:32.699
The group will no longer
have a presence in New York.

39:32.730 --> 39:35.369
You have my word.

39:39.070 --> 39:41.436
What is it
about you and I,

39:41.480 --> 39:46.747
that we do so much harm to the
ones we allege to care about?

39:46.780 --> 39:50.910
*

39:50.950 --> 39:53.089
I know about Irene Adler now.

39:54.490 --> 39:55.957
Ms. Hashemi explained.

39:55.990 --> 39:58.686
For years, you blamed
yourself for her death.

39:58.730 --> 40:01.699
You never questioned it...

40:01.730 --> 40:04.028
and the case could be
made that your brother

40:04.060 --> 40:06.119
is in banishment because of you.

40:06.170 --> 40:07.865
Do you have a point?

40:07.900 --> 40:12.906
Being loved by you is
a dangerous thing, Sherlock.

40:12.940 --> 40:15.932
Probably why
I'm still alive.

40:15.980 --> 40:18.801
Men like us...

40:18.850 --> 40:21.478
we're not meant_
to make such connections.

40:21.520 --> 40:22.873
I disagree.

40:22.920 --> 40:27.016
Ask yourself: who do you love

40:27.050 --> 40:29.109
more than any other
in the world?

40:30.960 --> 40:33.178
What do you think will happen
if you stay with her?

40:43.270 --> 40:45.807
WATSON: Hey.

40:46.840 --> 40:50.207
Got your message.

40:50.240 --> 40:52.606
Why are we at your
father's safe house?

40:52.650 --> 40:56.814
'Cause I_ was notified earlier
on that it is now my safe house.

40:56.850 --> 40:58.249
What are you talking about?

40:58.280 --> 41:00.043
Before my father
left New York,

41:00.090 --> 41:01.557
he gave up several
of his properties.

41:01.590 --> 41:02.955
Some to charity.

41:02.990 --> 41:06.118
This one... to me.

41:06.160 --> 41:08.924
Hmm, are we moving?

41:08.960 --> 41:10.222
I'm not.

41:10.260 --> 41:11.568
Thought you might like it.

41:13.970 --> 41:16.165
You're offering me my own place?

41:17.640 --> 41:20.165
Does this have anything
to do with all that junk

41:20.210 --> 41:22.030
that your father said
to you the other night?

41:22.080 --> 41:23.604
If by "junk" you mean his belief

41:23.640 --> 41:24.948
that I'm a cancer to
my friends and colleagues,

41:24.980 --> 41:26.538
then yes, that junk.

41:26.580 --> 41:28.104
What's next?

41:28.150 --> 41:29.845
Different precincts?

41:29.880 --> 41:32.041
Or are you thinking about
leaving New York entirely?

41:32.090 --> 41:33.978
Maybe we shouldn't even be
on the same continent.

41:34.020 --> 41:36.284
You jest, but there
is a case to be made.

41:36.320 --> 41:38.208
You are not your father;
you never will be.

41:38.260 --> 41:39.887
If he thinks he
needs to be alone

41:39.930 --> 41:42.490
for the rest of his life,
that is his problem.

41:44.770 --> 41:46.965
So, do you suppose your sister
will help us sell this place?

41:47.000 --> 41:48.968
That's a good question.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.490
We can ask her over dinner.

41:52.070 --> 41:53.537
We should ask
Marcus to jom, too.

41:53.570 --> 41:55.128
What does he know
about real estate?

41:55.180 --> 41:57.171
Probably nothing,

41:57.210 --> 42:00.202
but he's single and so is Lin.

42:01.920 --> 42:03.547
And to think that
my father thought that

42:03.580 --> 42:06.048
I was the greatest threat
to our circle of friends.

42:06.090 --> 42:07.079
Well, what's the worst
thing that could happen?
