Whew!

00:17.133 --> 00:18.600
Whoa!

00:23.367 --> 00:24.600
What'd you just erase?

00:24.600 --> 00:27.200
Nothing. I was just cleaning
the calendar.

00:28.467 --> 00:30.300
(<i>gasps </i>):
You just
cleaned off

00:30.300 --> 00:32.367
your dentist
appointment
for today.

00:32.367 --> 00:34.233
I don't have
a dentist appointment.

00:34.233 --> 00:35.867
Do you see it on the calendar?

00:35.867 --> 00:38.734
That's because
you just erased it.

00:38.734 --> 00:40.233
Please don't remind Dad!

00:40.233 --> 00:41.367
Please, Cory!

00:41.367 --> 00:43.233
I've got
better things to do

00:43.233 --> 00:45.000
than worry about your schedule.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.233
VICTOR:
Hmm-hmm!

00:46.233 --> 00:48.100
Good morning, everybody.

00:48.100 --> 00:49.200
Good morning, Dad.

00:49.200 --> 00:50.900
Cory has
a dentist appointment today.

00:52.033 --> 00:54.667
Really? There's nothing
on the calendar.

00:54.667 --> 00:57.100
Wait a minute.
There's nothing on the calendar!

00:57.100 --> 00:58.400
How am I supposed to know

00:58.400 --> 01:00.467
when your mom gets
back from Grandma's?

01:00.467 --> 01:01.934
Oh, oh, that's Cory's fault.

01:01.934 --> 01:04.100
He erased everything,
so you would forget

01:04.100 --> 01:06.467
that he had
a dentist appointment today.

01:08.867 --> 01:09.967
You know what, Dad?

01:09.967 --> 01:11.934
I'm not going to be able
to go today.

01:11.934 --> 01:14.667
You're shooting that commercial
at The Chill Grill,

01:14.667 --> 01:16.600
and I promised
to be there for you.

01:16.600 --> 01:18.767
And you will,
as soon as you get back

01:18.767 --> 01:20.500
from the dentist appointment.

01:20.500 --> 01:23.800
Can I go when Mom's back
from Grandma's?

01:23.800 --> 01:25.800
That would be nice,
but I don't know when your mom's

01:25.800 --> 01:27.867
getting back from Grandma's,
'cause you erased it.

01:27.867 --> 01:29.200
Smooth move!

01:29.200 --> 01:30.967
Look, Cory, don't you think
you're old enough

01:30.967 --> 01:32.233
not to have your mother
come down

01:32.233 --> 01:33.600
and hold your hand
at the dentist?

01:33.600 --> 01:34.934
No.

01:34.934 --> 01:36.867
Come on, son,
there's nothing to be afraid of.

01:36.867 --> 01:38.600
Yeah, except for...
(<i>imitates buzzing </i>)...

(<i>cackles </i>)

01:41.367 --> 01:43.600
Come on, Cory.
Stop freaking out.

01:43.600 --> 01:45.467
You haven't even had
a cavity before.

01:45.467 --> 01:46.500
And besides,

01:46.500 --> 01:49.233
us Baxters have
excellent teeth.

01:49.233 --> 01:50.934
(<i>xylophone tinkling </i>)

01:50.934 --> 01:52.000
I don't care.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.767
I just hate going
to the dentist.

01:56.667 --> 01:58.400
Good luck dragging him
down there today.

01:58.400 --> 02:00.667
Um... you know, Rae,
I got a few stops to make

02:00.667 --> 02:02.000
for this commercial shoot,

02:02.000 --> 02:03.834
so I was going to ask you
to drag him.

02:03.834 --> 02:04.400
Me?!

02:04.400 --> 02:05.300
Please?

02:05.300 --> 02:07.600
(<i>sighs </i>):
Fine.

02:07.600 --> 02:09.233
Thanks, Rae. And look...

02:09.233 --> 02:10.500
you know
he's a little nervous

02:10.500 --> 02:11.800
about going to the dentist,

02:11.800 --> 02:13.100
so please take it easy on him.

02:13.100 --> 02:14.934
And no...
(<i>imitates drill grinding </i>)

02:16.000 --> 02:19.200
Cory, Rae's taking you
to the dentist.

Someone's got
their first cavity.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.033
You're taking me to the dentist?

02:31.033 --> 02:32.367
Yes.

02:32.367 --> 02:33.967
And don't worry, little bro.

02:33.967 --> 02:35.834
Everything's
going to be okay.

02:37.600 --> 02:39.100
You're being nice.

your bubble,

but that is about

04:38.500 --> 04:39.934
that you could find.

04:39.934 --> 04:41.500
(<i>voice quivering </i>):
I know.

04:41.500 --> 04:43.200
It's the only one I've got.

04:53.200 --> 04:54.500
Hey, Mr. B.,

04:54.500 --> 04:55.400
why didn't you hire

04:55.400 --> 04:56.800
actors and a professional crew

04:56.800 --> 04:57.867
to do your commercial?

04:57.867 --> 04:59.767
Because those guys
are expensive,

04:59.767 --> 05:01.900
and you will work
for French fries.

05:01.900 --> 05:03.133
That's right.

05:03.133 --> 05:05.400
You know, if they weren't
so crispy and delicious,

05:05.400 --> 05:07.033
I'd be out of here.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.300
You know, to be honest with you,

05:09.300 --> 05:11.367
I only rented this equipment
for a couple of hours,

05:11.367 --> 05:13.600
so I need you guys to be
back on the set in five minutes.

05:13.600 --> 05:14.867
Costumes are in the kitchen.

05:14.867 --> 05:16.934
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, you didn't say

05:16.934 --> 05:18.400
anything about
costumes.
Mm-mm.

05:18.400 --> 05:21.600
No costumes, no French fries.

05:22.700 --> 05:24.867
Man!

05:28.300 --> 05:29.300
Mm-mm!

05:29.300 --> 05:31.867
Why you got to
be so stingy?

05:35.100 --> 05:37.600
What exactly are we
supposed to be, Mr. B.?

05:37.600 --> 05:39.100
Eddie, you're
an ice cube.

05:39.100 --> 05:40.767
That's the "Chill."

05:40.767 --> 05:41.967
And Chelsea,
you're the "Grill."

05:41.967 --> 05:43.033
And together,
the two of you

05:43.033 --> 05:44.133
are "The Chill Grill."

05:44.133 --> 05:46.767
Yeah, well, Mr. B.,

05:46.767 --> 05:48.000
I don't eat meat.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.500
And I don't really
wear it either.

05:50.500 --> 05:53.000
Mr. B., I'm not
really feeling this.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.900
Oh, come on, guys.
Don't be so negative.

05:54.900 --> 05:56.600
Look, let's just do
one rehearsal,

05:56.600 --> 05:58.100
and then it'll all make sense.

05:58.100 --> 06:00.066
Okay?

06:01.300 --> 06:03.300
And... action!

06:05.600 --> 06:08.400
Uh... "If you
like chillin'...

06:08.400 --> 06:11.200
"...and you
like grillin'...

06:11.200 --> 06:14.100
"...then come
to The Chill Grill,

06:14.100 --> 06:15.834
"where you chill...

06:15.834 --> 06:17.867
...while we grill"?!

06:17.867 --> 06:18.934
What?!

06:18.934 --> 06:20.300
This is lame.

06:20.300 --> 06:21.567
Oh, come on, guys!

06:21.567 --> 06:22.700
Don't you get it?

06:22.700 --> 06:25.400
It's a play on words--
"Chill/Grill."

06:25.400 --> 06:27.033
Actually, you're just
kind of saying

06:27.033 --> 06:28.300
"chill" and "grill" a lot.

06:28.300 --> 06:30.367
It's not really that playful.

06:30.367 --> 06:33.100
Man, you should really fire
the guy that wrote this.

06:33.100 --> 06:35.000
I am the guy that wrote this.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.734
Oh! Okay, well,
you are so fired.

06:37.734 --> 06:39.367
(<i>chuckles </i>)

06:39.367 --> 06:41.100
Like you can come up
with something better?

06:41.100 --> 06:43.700
Well, give me a second.

06:43.700 --> 06:45.600
Huh. Oh! I got it!

06:45.600 --> 06:47.800
I got it. Ah!

06:47.800 --> 06:50.400
Cory, will you please get
from underneath that table?

06:50.400 --> 06:53.400
You are setting a bad example
for all the other children.

06:55.500 --> 06:59.567
Cory Baxter... all aboard!

06:59.567 --> 07:01.233
(<i>imitates train whistle </i>)

07:01.233 --> 07:02.567
Ooh!

07:02.567 --> 07:05.300
Looks like we have
some unhappy passengers.

07:05.300 --> 07:06.500
Sorry, Dr. Horn.

07:06.500 --> 07:09.200
I think Cory's train got stuck
in a tunnel.

07:09.200 --> 07:11.467
Cory?

07:11.467 --> 07:13.700
I need to check your teeth,
to make sure they're healthy.

07:13.700 --> 07:15.500
No, you don't.

07:15.500 --> 07:18.500
We Baxters have excellent teeth.

07:18.500 --> 07:20.000
Oh, Cory...

07:20.000 --> 07:23.133
the station's
on a very tight schedule.

07:23.133 --> 07:25.233
Which means
you need to get your caboose

07:25.233 --> 07:26.700
from underneath that table.

07:26.700 --> 07:28.600
Come on, be
a good little engine, Cory.

07:28.600 --> 07:29.834
Say it with me:

07:29.834 --> 07:31.900
I think I can, I think I can...

07:31.900 --> 07:34.400
I don't think I can,
I don't think I can.

07:34.400 --> 07:36.000
I think
you'd better.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.567
Okay, okay!

07:37.567 --> 07:40.100
There you go.
Come on, Cory.

07:40.100 --> 07:42.200
Next stop, Examination Station!

07:42.200 --> 07:44.033
(<i>imitates train whistle </i>)

07:44.033 --> 07:46.734
(<i>imitates</i>
<i>train whistle </i>)

07:46.734 --> 07:48.600
See? There's nothing
to be afraid of.

07:48.600 --> 07:49.734
(<i>jackhammer pounding </i>)

07:49.734 --> 07:53.367
(<i>screams </i>)

07:53.367 --> 07:56.000
Cory, relax. They're just doing
some work on the street.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.133
This is the worst case of dental
phobia I've seen in a long time.

07:59.133 --> 08:00.300
Really? What do you do?

08:00.300 --> 08:01.667
Well, it usually helps

08:01.667 --> 08:03.834
if the patient can see
someone else being examined.

08:03.834 --> 08:05.300
Really?
Yeah, someone
close to them.

08:05.300 --> 08:06.300
Interesting.

08:06.300 --> 08:08.200
Mm-hmm. Often,
a blood relative.

08:08.200 --> 08:09.200
Hmm! Do tell.

08:09.200 --> 08:10.200
A sister.

08:10.200 --> 08:11.100
I see.

08:11.100 --> 08:12.800
Named Raven.

08:12.800 --> 08:15.000
You lost me...

08:16.100 --> 08:17.400
Get in the chair, Raven.

08:17.400 --> 08:18.500
Oh!
Come on!

08:18.500 --> 08:20.233
Show Cory
this is no big deal.

08:20.233 --> 08:21.300
Right.

08:21.300 --> 08:23.000
See, Cory?
It's like a ride.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.800
Whee...

08:27.033 --> 08:28.400
Okay, now, Cory,

08:28.400 --> 08:30.667
I'm going to tap Raven's teeth
with this little tool.

08:30.667 --> 08:31.967
Won't hurt a bit.

08:31.967 --> 08:35.133
Not at all, 'cause it's just
a teeth-tapping tool.

08:35.133 --> 08:36.200
That's right.

08:36.200 --> 08:37.467
Open wide.

08:39.300 --> 08:40.367
Good...

08:40.367 --> 08:41.834
good...

08:41.834 --> 08:44.200
Good...

08:44.200 --> 08:45.600
Ow!

08:45.600 --> 08:47.467
Was that a little sensitive?

08:47.467 --> 08:48.467
Just a little.

08:48.467 --> 08:49.600
Oh.

08:49.600 --> 08:51.734
But it's still fun.
See, Cory? Whee...

08:51.734 --> 08:54.200
(<i>whispers </i>):
Whee...

08:54.200 --> 08:56.800
Someone's got
their first cavity.

08:56.800 --> 08:58.500
Me?! No, wait.

08:58.500 --> 09:00.834
It was supposed to be Cory.

09:00.834 --> 09:03.500
I'll double check.

09:04.734 --> 09:05.734
Ow!

09:05.734 --> 09:06.500
Nope, it's you.

09:06.500 --> 09:07.500
(<i>yelps </i>)

09:07.500 --> 09:08.734
All right.

09:08.734 --> 09:10.800
Cory, do you mind
if I take Raven first?

09:10.800 --> 09:13.100
No. Go nuts.

09:13.100 --> 09:14.367
I'll be right back.

09:14.367 --> 09:16.900
I need to get
a bigger drill bit.

09:18.100 --> 09:19.300
Right!

09:19.300 --> 09:20.500
Bigger drill bit.

09:20.500 --> 09:23.600
Because the bigger,
the better, Doctor.

09:25.600 --> 09:27.734
What are you doing?
Dr. Horn can't get back in.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.900
Exactly. Nobody's going
to be drilling my grill...

09:29.900 --> 09:31.000
(<i>jackhammer pounding </i>)

09:31.000 --> 09:34.400
(<i>screaming </i>)

09:40.567 --> 09:42.767
Okay, we got to figure out
a way to get out of here.

09:42.767 --> 09:44.367
I thought you said
there was nothing

09:44.367 --> 09:45.600
to be afraid of.

09:45.600 --> 09:47.600
Oh, yeah, that's when
he was going to be

09:47.600 --> 09:48.900
drilling on your teeth.

09:48.900 --> 09:50.867
What do you mean
drilling my teeth?

09:50.867 --> 09:53.133
Listen, um, I had a vision

09:53.133 --> 09:54.934
that someone was going
to get a cavity.

09:54.934 --> 09:57.133
And I thought it was you.

09:57.133 --> 09:58.600
Why didn't you tell me?

09:58.600 --> 10:01.300
'Cause I didn't want you to go
crazy and freak out on me.

10:01.300 --> 10:03.100
Yeah, I know what you mean.

10:03.100 --> 10:05.667
Like lock the dentist
out of his office.

10:05.667 --> 10:07.233
Hey, I'll admit it.

10:07.233 --> 10:08.600
When it comes to the dentist,

10:08.600 --> 10:10.133
I'm just a big a wimp
as you are.

10:10.133 --> 10:12.734
Bigger.
Okay, bigger.

10:12.734 --> 10:14.800
Now will you
please be quiet

10:14.800 --> 10:16.967
and let me figure out a way
to get us out of here?

10:16.967 --> 10:20.500
Nurse, prepare
the Novocain
needle for Raven.

10:20.500 --> 10:22.667
That cavity of
hers is a doozy.

10:22.667 --> 10:25.300
(<i>squeals </i>)

10:25.300 --> 10:26.667
A doozy.

10:26.667 --> 10:28.400
(<i>squeaks </i>):
Cory...

10:28.400 --> 10:32.133
(<i>squeals </i>):
I got a doozy.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.000
(<i>rattling </i>)

10:35.000 --> 10:37.200
Who locked this door?

10:37.200 --> 10:39.567
Raven, Cory.

10:39.567 --> 10:40.967
Toot, toot!

10:40.967 --> 10:44.667
The conductor needs
to check your ticket.

10:44.667 --> 10:46.467
We got to get up
off this track.

10:46.467 --> 10:47.834
Out that way.
Where does it go?

10:47.834 --> 10:50.000
I don't care as long
as it's not here.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.100
GIRL:
Who are you?

10:55.100 --> 10:56.233
(<i>gasps </i>)

10:59.200 --> 11:01.400
Hey, how you doing?

11:01.400 --> 11:03.100
How am I doing?

11:03.100 --> 11:05.834
I've been sitting in this chair
for 20 minutes

11:05.834 --> 11:06.867
with my mouth open.

11:06.867 --> 11:08.834
How do you think I'm doing?

11:08.834 --> 11:11.467
Well, maybe you should
try closing it.

11:11.467 --> 11:13.033
Does Dr. Horn know you're here?

11:15.100 --> 11:16.467
Dr. Horn!
Shh...!

11:16.467 --> 11:18.967
Shh...!

11:20.133 --> 11:22.000
Shh... Jessie, shh.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.300
Girl, please.

11:23.300 --> 11:25.367
Now, um... listen,

11:25.367 --> 11:27.700
all right, Dr. Horn was busy

11:27.700 --> 11:29.233
so he sent us.

11:29.233 --> 11:31.500
You two are dentists?

11:31.500 --> 11:32.900
Yes, we are.

11:32.900 --> 11:35.867
In fact, I am

11:35.867 --> 11:36.900
Dr. Thinkingfast...

11:36.900 --> 11:38.233
(<i>chuckles </i>):
How you doing?

11:38.233 --> 11:41.000
And this is my associate,
Dr. Do-As-I-Say.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.233
(<i>quietly </i>):
Do as I say.

11:42.233 --> 11:44.600
He's a dentist?

11:44.600 --> 11:46.600
He's just a kid.

11:46.600 --> 11:48.033
Exactly, Jessie.

11:48.033 --> 11:49.400
And if you work hard
in school

11:49.400 --> 11:52.233
and brush and floss
your teeth every day,

11:52.233 --> 11:54.000
you could be one, too.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.300
Can I get my checkup,
please?

11:55.300 --> 11:56.600
I've got a soccer game.

11:56.600 --> 11:57.734
Okay, okay.

11:57.734 --> 11:58.834
Let's see what we got here.

11:58.834 --> 12:00.400
Now don't be scared,
don't be scared.

12:00.400 --> 12:01.500
I'm not scared.

12:01.500 --> 12:03.600
Only babies are afraid
of the dentist.

12:03.600 --> 12:05.367
Who you calling a baby?

12:05.367 --> 12:08.500
Yeah, 'cause
I'm a big boy.

12:08.500 --> 12:11.367
I mean, I'm a dentist.

12:11.367 --> 12:13.200
A big dentist.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.600
Okay. Just... just ignore him.

12:15.600 --> 12:16.900
Let's start, let's start.

12:16.900 --> 12:18.700
Are you ready?
Okay, open wide.

12:18.700 --> 12:19.934
Open wide, let's see.

12:19.934 --> 12:22.033
Ow!
Ow!

12:22.033 --> 12:24.734
Ow, let me look first, Doctor.
Let me...

12:27.400 --> 12:29.033
Let's see...

12:30.200 --> 12:31.867
Oh, nasty.

12:31.867 --> 12:33.567
Checkup's over.

12:33.567 --> 12:34.900
I want Dr. Horn.

12:34.900 --> 12:36.600
Dr. Ho...!
Shh!

12:36.600 --> 12:37.767
Shh...!

12:37.767 --> 12:40.600
Didn't we talk about this
before, Jessie?

12:40.600 --> 12:41.900
Dr. Horn is busy.

12:41.900 --> 12:43.800
That was just the first
part of the exam.

12:43.800 --> 12:45.367
Listen, the next part

12:45.367 --> 12:48.100
is where, um, you know,
we have to look at your teeth,

12:48.100 --> 12:52.500
examine and, you know, start...
doing stuff to them.

12:52.500 --> 12:54.000
Shouldn't you be
wearing gloves?

12:54.000 --> 12:55.200
(<i>grumbling </i>)

12:55.200 --> 12:56.600
Yes. We should.

12:56.600 --> 12:58.734
Thank you very much
for reminding me.

12:58.734 --> 12:59.734
Oh, yeah, gloves.

12:59.734 --> 13:01.667
Gloves are
very important.

13:01.667 --> 13:03.400
See, you will become
a dentist as well.

13:03.400 --> 13:04.734
Very good.

13:04.734 --> 13:06.100
You've been here before,

13:06.100 --> 13:08.100
haven't you?

13:08.100 --> 13:09.500
Calling Dr. Focus!

13:11.934 --> 13:13.734
All right,

13:13.734 --> 13:15.900
let's see
what we got here.

13:15.900 --> 13:18.400
Let's get started.
Let's see.

13:18.400 --> 13:20.000
Ooh, that's the air.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.467
I can use that for later.

13:22.600 --> 13:23.867
And that's the water.

13:23.867 --> 13:25.133
Okay.

13:26.400 --> 13:27.900
Oh, I know what this is.

13:27.900 --> 13:30.400
That's the thing that kind of
sucks the water off of you.

13:34.233 --> 13:35.600
Doctor, help me get it off.

13:35.600 --> 13:37.500
Turn it down or something.

13:38.500 --> 13:40.000
Oh!

13:41.567 --> 13:42.967
Help me!

13:42.967 --> 13:45.100
Can't get it...

13:46.200 --> 13:49.367
Ow!

13:49.367 --> 13:51.867
What is that?

13:58.967 --> 14:01.400
Novocain.

14:01.400 --> 14:03.700
That was supposed
to make my mouth numb.

14:06.367 --> 14:08.000
Uh, Dr. Thinkingfast,
are you okay?

14:08.000 --> 14:09.200
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I'm cool,

14:09.200 --> 14:11.500
I'm cool, I just can't...
can't feel my leg.

14:11.500 --> 14:13.000
But everything
is under control.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.033
What kind of dentist
pokes herself with a needle?

14:15.033 --> 14:16.233
(<i>grumbling </i>)

14:16.233 --> 14:17.567
Listen...

14:17.567 --> 14:22.600
Jessie, okay, I...

14:22.600 --> 14:26.000
graduated top of my class
at teeth fixing school.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.400
Thank you very much.

14:35.200 --> 14:36.934
Okay, now since we all agree

14:36.934 --> 14:39.133
that Mr. B's commercial
stunk on ice...

14:39.133 --> 14:41.000
Not all of us.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.834
Well, two out of three.

14:42.834 --> 14:44.700
Okay, here's the concept,
you guys.

14:44.700 --> 14:46.867
It's a soap opera
that takes place

14:46.867 --> 14:48.133
right here in the Chill Grill

14:48.133 --> 14:51.934
and it starts with
a beautiful woman in red.

14:54.600 --> 14:55.900
Oh...

14:55.900 --> 14:57.867
it is so good to be back at...

that they serve here at...

15:41.200 --> 15:43.800
I may have forgotten
a lot of things,

15:43.800 --> 15:46.900
but not how delicious
and wonderful the food
is here at...

It's a shame our
half father was lost at sea.

the patty melts here at...

Half father,
how did you survive?

16:11.734 --> 16:14.100
Well, half children, the only
thing that kept me alive

16:14.100 --> 16:17.000
was the thought of returning
for the delicious patty melts

16:17.000 --> 16:19.500
and the $1.99 side salads at...

Oh, but before you answer,
you should know

16:50.834 --> 16:54.133
that when faced with rejection,
I go to my sad place.

16:54.133 --> 16:56.400
Well, start packing
and take this with you.

16:56.400 --> 16:58.000
What?

16:58.000 --> 17:01.500
Come on, at least
it was better than
"Chillin' and Grillin'."

17:01.500 --> 17:02.867
What do you mean?

17:02.867 --> 17:04.867
Yours was ten times worse
than my idea.
What?

17:04.867 --> 17:05.867
No, it wasn't.

17:05.867 --> 17:07.133
Eddie, whose idea
was worse?

17:07.133 --> 17:08.934
Well, if it'd make you
feel any better,

well, I'm gonna need ten
dancers, a smoke machine

What does it have to do
with my teeth?

17:34.567 --> 17:36.300
Well, if your hair
looks cute,

no one will care about
your nasty little teeth.

17:39.133 --> 17:41.700

think it's time for us

to meet Dr.-Let's-

Listen, you're all finished.

17:47.767 --> 17:49.834
And we'll see you in six months.

17:49.834 --> 17:50.867
Is your leg still numb?

17:50.867 --> 17:52.600
No, I think it's o... oh!

17:55.000 --> 17:56.834
Doctor, help me up!

I thought you said
I was "Dr. Do-As-I-Say"?

Then do as I say and help me up!

18:22.834 --> 18:24.000
Hold it, you two!

18:24.000 --> 18:26.200
Oh. Snap.

18:26.200 --> 18:27.600
(<i>thuds </i>)

18:29.400 --> 18:31.000
Raven...
Yeah?

18:31.000 --> 18:33.734
There's nothing to be afraid of.

18:33.734 --> 18:35.767
Who's afraid?

18:35.767 --> 18:38.100
Raven, I know you came here
to calm Cory down

18:38.100 --> 18:40.500
and to set a good example.

18:40.500 --> 18:42.200
You can still do that.

18:48.300 --> 18:50.000
All done.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.100
Now was that so bad?

18:52.100 --> 18:54.500
(<i>garbled </i>):
I didn't feel a thing.

18:55.967 --> 18:58.033
Most people don't
feel a thing.

18:58.033 --> 19:00.300
There was nothing
to be afraid of.

19:01.767 --> 19:03.600
Of course there's nothing
to be afraid of.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.133
Most people don't
realize the fear

19:05.133 --> 19:06.767
is worse than
the actual treatment.

19:06.767 --> 19:08.500
You can go ahead
and rinse, Raven.

19:11.667 --> 19:14.667
(<i>slurps </i>)

19:17.400 --> 19:20.200
(<i>gargles </i>)

19:23.300 --> 19:25.133
My bad.

19:25.133 --> 19:27.033
Actually, it's my bad.

19:27.033 --> 19:29.200
I forgot to tell you
the numbness in your mouth

19:29.200 --> 19:31.600
will wear off
in a few hours.

19:33.467 --> 19:35.667
And the leg.

19:35.667 --> 19:36.834
Whoops.

19:36.834 --> 19:38.600
There you go, Raven.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.300
You ready?

19:43.300 --> 19:46.100
If Raven can do it,
then so can I.

19:46.100 --> 19:47.300
Okay.

19:53.867 --> 19:55.400
There you go.

20:03.300 --> 20:04.900
Open wide.

20:04.900 --> 20:06.200
That a boy.

20:13.233 --> 20:16.600
(<i>whirring </i>)

20:21.100 --> 20:22.734
What?

20:22.734 --> 20:25.567
Rae, the dentist said
to brush after every meal,

20:25.567 --> 20:27.200
not every bite.

20:27.200 --> 20:28.300
I just want to make sure

20:28.300 --> 20:29.900
that when I go in
for my next checkup,

20:29.900 --> 20:31.100
I don't have any cavities.

20:31.100 --> 20:32.900
Like me, Dad.

20:35.400 --> 20:38.300
Okay, I finished editing
my version of the commercial.

20:38.300 --> 20:39.934
Now it was a little bit long,

20:39.934 --> 20:41.400
so I had to cut
it down, y'all.

20:41.400 --> 20:42.967
But don't worry,

20:42.967 --> 20:44.367
I left in all the good stuff.

20:46.934 --> 20:49.300
I know what
you all are wondering.

20:49.300 --> 20:53.200
You're wondering "Where does
Eddie T. go out to eat?"

20:53.200 --> 20:55.834
Eddie T. goes to
his favorite restaurant

20:55.834 --> 20:59.400
where the chef is
a personal friend of mine.

20:59.400 --> 21:01.300
What's up with you, partner?

21:01.300 --> 21:03.600
Here I come, here I come.

21:05.200 --> 21:07.200
Where'd I go?
Where'd I go?

21:07.200 --> 21:11.734
And the waitresses here
are amazing.

21:11.734 --> 21:13.600
(<i>gasps </i>):
Here's my big song.

21:13.600 --> 21:15.000
Here's my big song.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.367
Mm.

21:16.367 --> 21:21.000
And the food is delicious.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.767
Well, I guess you cut out
my big dance number then, too.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.367
This is the place to be.

21:27.367 --> 21:30.300
(<i>chuckles </i>)

21:30.300 --> 21:31.500
(<i>laughs </i>)

21:33.600 --> 21:35.667
So what do you all think?
Y'all digging it?

21:35.667 --> 21:37.000
Eddie, we weren't
even in it.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
Yeah, you didn't even
mention the restaurant.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.867
It was all about you.
Yeah.

21:40.867 --> 21:43.300
Well, what do you
expect when you pay

21:43.300 --> 21:45.100
with French fries?

21:45.100 --> 21:47.200
Hey, people, why are we fighting

21:47.200 --> 21:50.000
when we could be flossing?
