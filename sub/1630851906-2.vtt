00:12.000 --> 00:14.640
Hello, there.
Paradise Court, please.

00:14.640 --> 00:16.880
Paradise Court, coming right up.

00:16.880 --> 00:18.400
Madam...

00:18.400 --> 00:19.840
Thank you.

00:47.880 --> 00:49.440
Del.

01:23.320 --> 01:25.760
HE REVS THE ENGINE

01:28.760 --> 01:31.360
HE REVS THE ENGINE

01:44.400 --> 01:46.680
Oi! What are you doing?!

02:46.240 --> 02:47.920
Thank you.
Enjoy your stay.

02:47.920 --> 02:48.960
Bye.

02:50.600 --> 02:53.600
Mr and Mrs Appleby, I presume.

02:53.600 --> 02:54.760
That's us.

02:54.760 --> 02:57.320
Welcome to paradise!
Oh, very nice.

02:57.320 --> 02:58.440
Thank you.

02:58.440 --> 02:59.760
Good, good, good.

02:59.760 --> 03:01.240
Come, come, follow me.

03:20.840 --> 03:22.200
Goodnight.

03:22.200 --> 03:24.720
Oh, yes. Goodnight.

03:24.720 --> 03:26.320
And, er, thank you.

SOMBRE CLASSICAL MUSIC
PLAYS LOUDLY

04:43.680 --> 04:45.920
KNOCKING ON THE DOOR

05:02.120 --> 05:03.680
There you are!

05:03.680 --> 05:05.880
It's a wonder you hear anything
with that racket.

05:05.880 --> 05:08.680
Well, don't just stand gawping,
fetch my bags in.

05:08.680 --> 05:10.360
And don't give him too much
of a tip.

05:10.360 --> 05:12.520
I'm sure he brought us
the long way round.

05:12.520 --> 05:15.120
And found every pothole
along the way!

05:18.080 --> 05:21.200
Clytemnestra's a friend of yours,
is she?

05:21.200 --> 05:23.760
A relative. My stepmother.

05:23.760 --> 05:26.680
My condolences.
Talk about a backseat driver.

05:26.680 --> 05:29.160
It was too fast. It was too slow.

05:29.160 --> 05:31.520
The cab was too hot.
Yeah, that sounds about right.

05:31.520 --> 05:33.440
I can take it from here.
How much do I, er...?

05:33.440 --> 05:34.480
Let me just check.

05:37.640 --> 05:39.440
With the excess, that'll be...

05:40.680 --> 05:43.040
..75 of your new English pence.
Here you go.

05:43.040 --> 05:45.160
Take 80.
Think of it as danger money.

05:45.160 --> 05:46.320
Ta very much.

05:59.960 --> 06:02.280
Did you get it all in?
Just about.

06:02.280 --> 06:04.160
Just make sure
you put it somewhere safe.

06:04.160 --> 06:06.640
The rest arrives tomorrow.
The rest?

06:07.760 --> 06:09.800
Well, didn't you get my letter?

06:09.800 --> 06:12.320
I've sold the house
and bought a place in Eynsham.

06:13.320 --> 06:14.800
Joyce has got herself engaged

06:14.800 --> 06:17.120
to some man she's living in sin with
at Witney.

06:17.120 --> 06:18.720
Oh, she never mentioned.

06:18.720 --> 06:21.040
Well, who's to blame for that
if you don't keep in touch?

06:22.000 --> 06:24.240
Keith Garrett, his name is.

06:25.720 --> 06:27.600
Couldn't you stay with them?

06:27.600 --> 06:29.400
Do you think I'd be here if I could?

06:30.880 --> 06:33.520
They're abroad until Wednesday.

06:33.520 --> 06:36.920
Unmarried and both in the same room.

06:36.920 --> 06:39.280
Hm!
It's not right.

06:39.280 --> 06:41.200
But what about a hotel?

06:41.200 --> 06:43.760
Well, you'll be all right on the
sofa for a couple of nights.

06:43.760 --> 06:46.520
I mean, I don't like it
any more than you do.

06:46.520 --> 06:49.120
It's only till I take possession.
When's that?

06:50.520 --> 06:53.280
There is no need to ask
in that tone.

06:53.280 --> 06:56.360
I am not one
of your interrogation suspects.

06:58.640 --> 06:59.920
Monday.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.040
But you don't have to worry about
me.

07:02.040 --> 07:04.040
I don't expect to be looked after.

07:04.040 --> 07:06.000
Ha! You won't even know I'm here.

07:15.040 --> 07:17.880
STRANGE: If you could give your
statement to my colleague over here.

07:21.800 --> 07:24.600
It looks to be robbery.
Wallet's empty.

07:24.600 --> 07:27.920
Dudley Lunn,
according to the Speedy Cabs office.

07:27.920 --> 07:29.320
42.

07:29.320 --> 07:32.360
Married.
Uniform's notifying his wife now.

07:32.360 --> 07:34.800
The paperboy came upon the car
just after 6:00.

07:36.120 --> 07:37.480
Doctor.

07:40.400 --> 07:43.120
CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS
Do we know how long he's been there?

07:43.120 --> 07:44.600
Rigor well established,

07:44.600 --> 07:47.840
which, as well as making my labours
more difficult...

07:49.320 --> 07:51.880
..suggests he's been dead
about 12 hours.

07:51.880 --> 07:54.800
Are we sure about that,
the time of death?

07:54.800 --> 07:59.760
The glass on his watch is cracked
and the hands are set to 6:50.

07:59.760 --> 08:04.120
Then the watch stopped ticking
several hours before Mr Lunn did.

08:05.200 --> 08:07.440
The body doesn't lie, Morse.

08:07.440 --> 08:09.800
Myself notwithstanding,

08:09.800 --> 08:13.920
it's the only impartial, reliable
witness to any suspicious death.

08:14.920 --> 08:16.800
So, ten-ish last night, then.

08:16.800 --> 08:19.440
Mm, by my reckoning, yes.

08:19.440 --> 08:21.600
Single shot to the back of the
skull.

08:21.600 --> 08:23.920
Point-blank range.

08:23.920 --> 08:27.360
Exit wound just above the left eye.

08:27.360 --> 08:29.800
As you can see...

08:29.800 --> 08:34.160
..the bullet strikes the windscreen,
drops onto the dash.

08:34.160 --> 08:36.800
Et voila

08:38.320 --> 08:41.640
Looks to be a .22,
but it has taken quite a battering.

08:41.640 --> 08:45.440
I'll be able to give you the def gen
after the postmortem.

08:45.440 --> 08:47.880
Shall we say 2:30?

08:47.880 --> 08:50.000
It's late for you, Doctor.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.320
Steak and kidney at The Eagle.

08:53.400 --> 08:55.680
I wouldn't want to rush that
dissection.

09:00.520 --> 09:02.680
A cabbie's about as easy a mark as
it gets.

09:03.760 --> 09:05.640
They have to go out
with a decent float,

09:05.640 --> 09:07.880
and it'll only get bigger
as the shift goes on.

09:09.040 --> 09:10.800
There was a driver a couple of weeks
ago,

09:10.800 --> 09:12.560
on our old ground,
got put in hospital.

09:12.560 --> 09:14.120
Pistol-whipped.

09:14.120 --> 09:17.440
From what he could remember, the
suspect was bearded, dark-haired.

09:17.440 --> 09:19.200
Speedy Cabs again?
No.

09:19.200 --> 09:20.720
A2B Cars out of Cowley.

09:21.680 --> 09:23.760
It's a long way to drive to kill
someone, isn't it?

09:23.760 --> 09:25.160
Yeah.

09:25.160 --> 09:27.280
Private, though. No witnesses.

09:27.280 --> 09:29.320
Well, that's fine,
as far as it goes.

09:29.320 --> 09:32.120
But if he kills his ride,
how's he gonna get back?

09:32.120 --> 09:34.080
Maybe he didn't have to.

09:34.080 --> 09:35.440
Carry on down the lane aways,

09:35.440 --> 09:37.360
there's a place called
Paradise Court.

09:38.320 --> 09:39.760
Some sort of naturist camp.

09:40.720 --> 09:41.960
For nudists.

09:43.120 --> 09:45.280
That's where the paperboy was for.

09:45.280 --> 09:46.760
What have you got there?

09:47.720 --> 09:50.600
A piece of old tissue?
All right, matey, don't rub it in.

09:50.600 --> 09:52.160
We haven't all got your eye.

09:52.160 --> 09:54.400
I just thought it might've been
something, is all.

09:54.400 --> 09:56.320
Best bag it in any case.

09:56.320 --> 09:58.960
We'll talk to the family
and have a word with his work.

09:58.960 --> 10:02.360
Do you want to see if anyone heard
anything up at that...

10:02.360 --> 10:03.840
..place?

10:19.760 --> 10:21.120
When he didn't come home,

10:21.120 --> 10:23.560
I thought maybe he'd had a long
fare, you know?

10:25.080 --> 10:27.120
Somebody might want him
to take them to Grimsby.

10:27.120 --> 10:28.760
or anywhere you care to think of.

10:30.040 --> 10:32.720
I did say that to the constables
who came by earlier.

10:33.840 --> 10:36.840
I thought they would have written it
down in their notebook or somewhere.

10:36.840 --> 10:38.080
But they didn't.

10:39.640 --> 10:41.680
I'm afraid that's our job, Mrs Lunn.

10:43.200 --> 10:45.320
I'm sorry to have to ask, but...

10:46.680 --> 10:48.560
..all was well at home, was it?

10:48.560 --> 10:49.840
Oh, yes.

10:51.240 --> 10:53.040
Ours was a very happy marriage.

10:55.880 --> 10:57.760
Fenella will be heartbroke.

10:57.760 --> 10:59.640
She's out playing right now, but...

11:00.640 --> 11:02.520
..she idolises her father.

11:05.400 --> 11:07.360
You will tell Pauline, will you?

11:07.360 --> 11:08.960
Or have I got to do that?

11:08.960 --> 11:10.320
Who's Pauline?

11:12.200 --> 11:14.160
He was married before.

11:14.160 --> 11:15.880
She lives in Headington.

11:15.880 --> 11:17.680
There's a kiddie, a boy.

11:19.040 --> 11:20.440
She'll have to be told.

11:20.440 --> 11:22.760
And she won't thank me for it,
will she?

11:25.640 --> 11:28.000
I think it's probably better
coming from you.

11:32.360 --> 11:34.040
Good afternoon, sir.

11:35.960 --> 11:37.840
Luggage in the car, is it?

11:37.840 --> 11:39.600
No, it's, er...

11:39.600 --> 11:43.080
First visit?
Well, there's no need to be nervous.

11:43.080 --> 11:44.320
No need at all.

11:45.400 --> 11:48.560
Now, I don't think we've any
reservation down for today.

11:48.560 --> 11:49.840
But we've plenty of vacancies.

11:49.840 --> 11:51.520
The season hasn't really got
going yet.

11:51.520 --> 11:52.920
I'm a policeman.

11:54.440 --> 11:57.760
And I'm a former major with the
Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders.

11:58.720 --> 12:02.840
But the naturist world
takes us as it finds us, Mr...?

12:02.840 --> 12:05.520
Detective Sergeant Strange,
Thames Valley.

12:06.520 --> 12:09.200
And I'm not here for a frolic
in the altogether, Major...?

12:10.480 --> 12:11.840
Jones.

12:25.080 --> 12:26.600
Ahem!

12:27.640 --> 12:30.440
If I could have everyone's attention
for a moment.

12:30.440 --> 12:34.120
This is, er... Detective Sergeant
Strange, Thames Valley.

12:34.120 --> 12:37.000
If you wouldn't mind putting
something on while I talk to you.

12:45.040 --> 12:46.480
Thank you.

12:46.480 --> 12:51.280
Now, I must ask if any of you saw or
heard anything unusual last night.

12:51.280 --> 12:54.480
I did say, Sergeant,
with the music from the luau...

12:54.480 --> 12:56.800
Like a gunshot, you mean?
Perhaps.

12:56.800 --> 12:59.040
Miss...?
Appleby.

12:59.040 --> 13:00.960
Alison Appleby, Mrs.

13:00.960 --> 13:02.520
I thought it was a car backfiring.

13:03.560 --> 13:04.720
Barry Appleby.

13:04.720 --> 13:05.840
Baz.

13:05.840 --> 13:07.440
What time would that have been?

13:07.440 --> 13:09.800
The guests all turn their watches in
upon arrival

13:09.800 --> 13:12.400
as part of the process
of getting back to nature.

13:12.400 --> 13:16.080
That's true, but I heard the church
clock chime ten shortly after.

13:16.080 --> 13:18.040
Right.

13:25.160 --> 13:28.520
No need to go to all that trouble,
Mrs Lunn. It's no trouble.

13:28.520 --> 13:30.720
And Pauline, please.

13:30.720 --> 13:32.440
I only get called Mrs Lunn

13:32.440 --> 13:35.880
by solicitors or the Social
or up at Mark's school.

13:35.880 --> 13:38.960
Cowley Secondary Modern?
I thought I recognised the uniform.

13:38.960 --> 13:40.960
My two went there.
Oh, yeah?

13:40.960 --> 13:43.280
When was that?
Oh, a long time past.

13:43.280 --> 13:45.880
The youngest, my boy,
is in the Army now out in Ireland.

13:45.880 --> 13:49.440
And my daughter, well, she's with
the Welfare looking after kids.

13:49.440 --> 13:51.240
I probably know her.

13:51.240 --> 13:53.240
Mark's got into trouble once or
twice.

13:53.240 --> 13:54.920
He's not a bad boy.

13:54.920 --> 13:56.440
He just misses his dad.

13:56.440 --> 13:58.960
God knows what this will do to him.

13:58.960 --> 14:01.040
I'm sorry for asking, but, er...

14:01.960 --> 14:04.600
..you are divorced, I take it?
Oh, yeah.

14:04.600 --> 14:06.560
Four years, last February.

14:06.560 --> 14:09.600
Ann is the official Mrs Lunn now.
I'm...

14:09.600 --> 14:12.200
Well, I don't know what you'd call
it. What would it be?

14:12.200 --> 14:14.240
The dowager Mrs Lunn?

14:15.240 --> 14:16.840
He gambled, did he?
Gambled?

14:16.840 --> 14:19.800
If it had four legs, he couldn't
throw money after it fast enough.

14:19.800 --> 14:22.480
That and...
Well, you've met her.

14:23.480 --> 14:25.560
How did he meet the second Mrs Lunn?

14:25.560 --> 14:29.000
Oh, didn't she say?
She worked in the cab office.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.160
On the radio, handing out the jobs.

14:31.160 --> 14:32.720
It started there.

14:32.720 --> 14:34.200
They usually fizzled out.

14:34.200 --> 14:37.760
Only, he got her in the family way
and, well...

14:37.760 --> 14:39.720
You said, they usually.

14:40.760 --> 14:44.600
With Dudley it was four legs, good,
two legs, better.

14:45.760 --> 14:47.720
I tried to keep it from Mark as best
I could,

14:47.720 --> 14:49.680
but children pick up on
things, don't they?

14:55.480 --> 14:57.000
GUNSHOT

15:00.200 --> 15:01.600
GUNSHOT

15:06.480 --> 15:08.280
GUNSHOT

15:30.040 --> 15:31.880
All right, then,
see you back at base.

15:32.840 --> 15:36.400
WELSH ACCENT:
45, 45, pick up 52 Festive Avenue

15:36.400 --> 15:39.040
going to Headington on account.

15:39.040 --> 15:40.760
A Mr Benn.

15:40.760 --> 15:42.720
No, it's just awful news.

15:42.720 --> 15:43.960
Awful.

15:43.960 --> 15:45.760
You heard about what happened

15:45.760 --> 15:48.200
to the driver from A2B Cars,
presumably?

15:48.200 --> 15:50.280
The fellas have been talking
about nothing else.

15:50.280 --> 15:52.560
You hope it's just a one-off.
But now this?

15:53.760 --> 15:55.600
Puts the fear of God in everyone.

15:55.600 --> 15:57.000
TELEPHONE RINGS

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
Oh, sorry about this.
Got to answer it.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.640
Usually, we've a girl,
but it's her afternoon off.

16:01.640 --> 16:03.480
Speedy Cabs, can I help you?

16:03.480 --> 16:05.400
Hello?
CALLER HANGS UP

16:07.560 --> 16:09.360
Oh, yeah, that's my Siwan.

16:10.880 --> 16:12.560
Joan, she'd be in English.

16:12.560 --> 16:15.320
Though most everybody calls her
Birdie.

16:15.320 --> 16:16.920
Fy nghyw bach.

16:16.920 --> 16:20.400
Always singing round the house,
she is. Like a cock linnet.

16:20.400 --> 16:21.880
Beautiful.

16:23.520 --> 16:25.440
Have you got kids?
Yeah, two, as it happens.

16:25.440 --> 16:28.520
TELEPHONE RINGS
Speedy Cabs, how can I help you?

16:28.520 --> 16:31.200
Erm, yeah.
What time would you like that for?

16:31.200 --> 16:33.320
Oh, our pleasure.

16:33.320 --> 16:34.840
Thank you, now.

16:34.840 --> 16:36.280
Goodbye.

16:36.280 --> 16:39.520
Did you give him a job
to Hovelle Wood last night?

16:39.520 --> 16:41.320
Paradise Court, perhaps.

16:41.320 --> 16:43.560
That's where it happened, is it?

16:45.280 --> 16:47.840
Er, no, erm,
well, the last dispatch I had for...

16:48.760 --> 16:51.120
..for Dudley was... Let me see now.
It's all in here, see?

16:51.120 --> 16:53.440
Oh, yeah, here it is, look.

16:53.440 --> 16:57.280
5:18 pick up.
Summertown for Beaufort.

16:57.280 --> 16:58.440
Dr Hu.

16:59.520 --> 17:00.960
Oriental studies.

17:00.960 --> 17:02.640
Old boy, one of our regulars.

17:03.880 --> 17:05.480
And there was nothing after that?

17:05.480 --> 17:07.520
Well, if there was,
it didn't come from me.

17:07.520 --> 17:10.160
Oh, I had a word with the boys.

17:10.160 --> 17:14.640
A couple of the lads said he was on
the rank at Cowley East last night.

17:19.320 --> 17:21.280
Do you want some tanning butter?

17:21.280 --> 17:23.520
No.
You don't want to burn.

17:27.320 --> 17:29.200
Where did you get to last night?

17:29.200 --> 17:31.080
I woke up and you weren't there.

17:31.080 --> 17:33.720
Call of nature.
You were ever such a long time.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.320
Yes, well, I couldn't find it.

17:35.320 --> 17:37.360
Maybe I should've said...

17:37.360 --> 17:39.080
..that we'd just come by taxi.

17:39.080 --> 17:40.880
You don't think it was our driver,
do you?

17:40.880 --> 17:42.560
No, why would it be?

17:42.560 --> 17:44.680
He dropped us off at 7:30.

17:44.680 --> 17:46.920
You said yourself,
you heard the gunshot around 10:00.

17:46.920 --> 17:48.280
If that's what you did hear.

17:48.280 --> 17:51.880
He's hardly likely to hang around at
the top of the lane all that time.

17:51.880 --> 17:53.960
Was it the top of the lane?

17:53.960 --> 17:56.080
Oh, I don't know, do I?
I'm just guessing.

17:56.080 --> 17:57.800
Anyway, you don't want to get
involved.

17:57.800 --> 18:00.800
I wish that man would go and clip
his privets elsewhere.

18:00.800 --> 18:02.280
He's staring!

18:05.240 --> 18:09.960
8:30, 8:45. Something like that is
about the last time we saw him.

18:09.960 --> 18:12.320
Wouldn't you say, Brian?
Yeah, that's right.

18:13.320 --> 18:17.200
Dudley was at the, er, top of the
rank waiting for a fare.

18:17.200 --> 18:19.120
Did you see who got into the cab?

18:19.120 --> 18:20.360
Er, no.

18:20.360 --> 18:23.080
Did either of you have a job
out to Hovelle Wood last night?

18:23.080 --> 18:25.280
Hovelle Wood?
Mm-hm.

18:25.280 --> 18:27.720
No, sir, no.
MAN: All right, fellas?

18:28.920 --> 18:31.640
What's all this?
The police, Joe.

18:31.640 --> 18:33.360
It's about Dudley.
Dudley?

18:33.360 --> 18:35.280
What about him?
You haven't heard?

18:35.280 --> 18:37.360
Oh, my!

18:37.360 --> 18:40.160
He's been murdered, Mr...?

18:40.160 --> 18:42.920
North. Joe North.

18:44.040 --> 18:45.080
Here, don't I...?

18:45.080 --> 18:47.520
Yeah, Mr North dropped a fare
at my house this morning, sir.

18:47.520 --> 18:50.200
Detective Sergeant Morse.
Detective Chief Inspector Thursday.

18:51.760 --> 18:53.920
So... ..what happened?

18:55.120 --> 18:57.280
Not another guy like this fella with
A2B?

18:57.280 --> 18:59.960
We're keeping an open mind,
but it looks that way.

18:59.960 --> 19:01.680
Here, Clarry, you're up, look.

19:01.680 --> 19:04.120
Oh!
If you'll excuse me, officers.

19:04.120 --> 19:05.760
Certainly, Mr Haynes.

19:05.760 --> 19:08.000
He was keen on the horses,
I understand.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.360
Oh, yes.

19:10.400 --> 19:11.760
He was always touching one of us up

19:11.760 --> 19:13.480
for a couple of quid to put on the
gee-gees.

19:14.440 --> 19:17.000
Right.
And he liked women, too, I hear.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.200
Well, crumpet in and out
the back of the cab all day.

19:21.200 --> 19:22.560
Can't blame him, can you?

19:24.360 --> 19:25.680
Well, if anything else

19:25.680 --> 19:27.680
should cross your mind, you know
where to find us.

19:39.480 --> 19:44.440
I can confirm that the bullet
which killed Mr Lunn was a .22.

19:45.520 --> 19:48.280
I've passed it to Ballistics
for a full analysis.

19:48.280 --> 19:49.840
Small calibre.

19:49.840 --> 19:51.520
A woman's gun, perhaps?

19:51.520 --> 19:53.840
Ruth Ellis fired a .38, of course.
She did.

19:53.840 --> 19:55.600
But it wasn't hers.

19:55.600 --> 19:58.680
You're not gonna want to keep
a Smith & Wesson in your handbag

19:58.680 --> 20:00.520
along with your compact, are you?

20:00.520 --> 20:01.720
Anything else?

20:01.720 --> 20:05.400
Nothing to suggest any kind of
struggle for the weapon.

20:05.400 --> 20:08.880
He very likely had no inkling
he was about to die.

20:09.840 --> 20:11.480
The Ostrich Fanciers' Club.

20:11.480 --> 20:13.160
Never heard of it.
No address.

20:13.160 --> 20:15.200
But there is a telephone number
on the back.

20:15.200 --> 20:17.640
I'll see if we can get a reverse
trace.

20:17.640 --> 20:19.760
What will he have had in his wallet,
£10, £15, £20?

20:19.760 --> 20:22.720
Would you kill someone for that?
I've seen people killed for less.

20:22.720 --> 20:25.160
What are you saying, that emptying
the wallet was a blind?

20:25.160 --> 20:28.120
Well, unless I'm much mistaken,
that's not just blood on his collar.

20:28.120 --> 20:29.640
That's lipstick.

20:29.640 --> 20:31.680
No. If you could keep Fenella
with you

20:31.680 --> 20:33.560
and I'll fetch her on the
way back.

20:35.640 --> 20:39.000
They're sending a car for me
to go and do the identifying.

20:40.080 --> 20:43.440
I know, I can't believe it myself.
SHE CHUCKLES

20:46.040 --> 20:49.000
I don't know what I'm going to do
for her tea.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.240
He was something of a womaniser,

20:51.240 --> 20:53.960
according to his mates
and the first Mrs Lunn.

20:53.960 --> 20:55.440
Indeed.

20:55.440 --> 20:59.080
Morse noted a smudge of bright,
red lipstick on his collar.

21:00.040 --> 21:02.520
Another woman, then?

21:02.520 --> 21:03.760
A jealous husband, perhaps?

21:05.000 --> 21:06.400
Or wife, sir.

21:06.400 --> 21:07.920
Or wife.

21:09.240 --> 21:10.920
WOMAN:
'We've 20,000 people on the site.

21:10.920 --> 21:13.840
'Without a name, I can't really
help you.' Right. Understood.

21:13.840 --> 21:16.240
Well, thank you very much.
Sorry to have troubled you.

21:19.560 --> 21:22.080
I've conducted some odd interviews
in my time, matey.

21:22.080 --> 21:24.800
But stone me, this morning's go
takes the Garibaldi.

21:24.800 --> 21:27.040
What's this?
Paradise Court.

21:27.040 --> 21:28.320
The nudie place.

21:28.320 --> 21:31.400
A couple there think they'd heard a
gunshot. A Mr and Mrs Appleby.

21:31.400 --> 21:34.400
Only, they took it to be a car
backfiring just before 10:00.

21:35.360 --> 21:39.360
Lunn picks his fare up outside the
station between 8:45 and 9:00,

21:39.360 --> 21:43.480
gets to the Hovelle Wood area
between 9:45, 10:00.

21:43.480 --> 21:44.600
That works, more or less.

21:44.600 --> 21:46.840
Must've been someone
who knows Paradise Court, then.

21:46.840 --> 21:49.320
Get anywhere with
The Ostrich Fanciers' Club?

21:49.320 --> 21:52.040
There's nothing on record in Oxford.
Nothing in the phonebook.

21:52.040 --> 21:54.960
And the number just gets you the
BLMC switchboard.

21:54.960 --> 21:56.200
But without a name...

22:04.640 --> 22:06.320
TELEVISION ON IN THE FOREGROUND

22:06.320 --> 22:08.240
Just going out.
You just got in.

22:08.240 --> 22:10.400
What about tea?

22:10.400 --> 22:11.760
Well, there's, er...

22:11.760 --> 22:13.920
There's cheese in the fridge
and bread in the bin.

22:14.960 --> 22:17.120
I take it I have to see for myself,
then.

22:17.120 --> 22:19.400
Well, you found your way
to the drinks cabinet all right.

22:19.400 --> 22:21.880
I can't imagine the pantry
will long prove terra incognita.

22:21.880 --> 22:24.400
Oh, yes, always the Latin!

22:25.440 --> 22:28.840
Must come in very handy consorting
with the criminal classes.

22:30.040 --> 22:32.040
I expect this is one of yours,
is it?

22:32.040 --> 22:35.400
Taxi drivers murdered
in nudist camps.

22:35.400 --> 22:37.880
People running around with no
clothes on.

22:37.880 --> 22:39.520
Urgh!

22:39.520 --> 22:41.000
It's squalid.

22:41.000 --> 22:44.080
And you grubbing around in it
by way of a living.

22:45.720 --> 22:48.080
I can't imagine what your dad
would say.

22:48.080 --> 22:51.000
Well, not much,
if he was running true to form.

22:51.000 --> 22:55.040
Still, being the son of a cabbie may
have its practical use, for once.

22:55.040 --> 22:56.640
A cabbie?!

22:56.640 --> 23:00.360
Your father was a
private hire chauffeur.

23:00.360 --> 23:02.480
He drove the Aga Khan!

23:02.480 --> 23:04.200
Once.

23:04.200 --> 23:05.680
He was a taxi driver.

23:05.680 --> 23:08.440
SHE SIGHS HEAVILY
Got to drag us down, haven't you?

23:08.440 --> 23:10.440
Belittle him.

23:10.440 --> 23:12.440
Make him look small.

23:12.440 --> 23:18.320
I can't imagine your father and this
dead man have a thing in common.

23:18.320 --> 23:20.800
Well, there's the horses.
Our dead man liked to gamble.

23:20.800 --> 23:22.560
Well, there's nothing wrong with
that.

23:22.560 --> 23:24.480
A lot of men like a flutter.

23:24.480 --> 23:28.080
Oh, and he left his wife and child
for another woman that he'd, erm...

23:28.080 --> 23:30.000
What's the polite phrase?

23:30.000 --> 23:31.520
..put in the family way.

23:31.520 --> 23:34.680
So, there's that, I suppose.

23:34.680 --> 23:36.120
Don't wait up.

23:40.400 --> 23:43.000
You haven't seen my husband,
have you, Major?

23:43.000 --> 23:45.200
I appear to have lost him.

23:45.200 --> 23:47.240
He asked me to call him a cab.

23:48.280 --> 23:49.680
About an hour ago.

23:49.680 --> 23:51.280
Did he say when he'd be back?

23:52.240 --> 23:53.640
I'm afraid not, Mrs Appleby.

23:55.360 --> 23:57.320
Thank you.
You're welcome.

24:02.160 --> 24:04.000
The body of Christ.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.400
Amen.

24:07.080 --> 24:08.600
The body of Christ.

24:09.560 --> 24:11.160
Amen.

24:25.120 --> 24:26.520
The body of Christ.

24:27.720 --> 24:29.040
Amen.

24:48.600 --> 24:50.040
Whoa! Whoa...

24:54.280 --> 24:55.720
It's Mark, isn't it?

24:56.800 --> 24:57.880
Mark Lunn.

24:59.120 --> 25:01.520
I'm Detective Sergeant Morse.

25:01.520 --> 25:03.880
I'm investigating
what happened to your father.

25:03.880 --> 25:06.200
You're lying.
No, I'm not. Let me...

25:06.200 --> 25:07.840
Let me show you my warrant card.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.800
Every police officer has to have a
warrant card,

25:09.800 --> 25:12.120
to prove he is who he says he is.
Look.

25:12.120 --> 25:13.680
Take a look.

25:14.880 --> 25:16.120
What are you doing here?

25:16.120 --> 25:18.240
They come back to the scene
of the crime.

25:18.240 --> 25:20.440
Murderers. I've read about it.
Yeah.

25:21.680 --> 25:24.240
Where did you get the gun?
My dad gave it to me.

25:24.240 --> 25:26.440
He gave it to me for rabbits.

25:26.440 --> 25:28.080
My dad gave me a gun once.

25:28.080 --> 25:29.600
For my birthday.

25:29.600 --> 25:31.080
That was for rabbits, too.

25:32.080 --> 25:33.320
Can I take a look?

25:35.920 --> 25:37.240
Swap?

25:40.600 --> 25:42.280
HE CLICKS OPEN THE GUN

25:42.280 --> 25:43.560
Hey!

25:43.560 --> 25:45.840
You're too young
to be in possession of a firearm.

25:45.840 --> 25:48.400
And it's not for you to find out
who killed your father.

25:48.400 --> 25:50.000
No matter how much you might
want to.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.280
I'm staking out the crime scene,
in case he comes back.

25:52.280 --> 25:54.120
No, you're going home.
And I'm taking you.

25:54.120 --> 25:56.160
I know you want to help,
but this isn't the way.

25:56.160 --> 25:57.600
Jump in the car.

26:50.120 --> 26:51.840
ENTRY SYSTEM BUZZES

26:58.040 --> 27:00.680
She won't be a minute,
if you want to come up.

27:00.680 --> 27:02.280
No, no, you're all right,
I'll, er...

27:02.280 --> 27:03.640
I'll wait here.

27:13.920 --> 27:15.600
Is it, erm...?

27:15.600 --> 27:17.440
Yeah.

27:17.440 --> 27:18.600
Oh, yeah.

27:19.760 --> 27:23.560
I'd forgot to say about gloves.
I asked someone who'd been to one.

27:23.560 --> 27:26.600
I didn't want to let the side
down. You couldn't.

27:34.840 --> 27:36.000
Should we...?

27:37.000 --> 27:38.360
Yeah, yeah, of course.

27:39.840 --> 27:41.280
I got you these.

27:42.240 --> 27:43.520
Thank you.

27:45.120 --> 27:46.240
Shall we...?

27:54.000 --> 27:55.840
Let me get you the door.
Thanks.

28:01.560 --> 28:03.480
Mind your dress.
SHE CHUCKLES

28:06.280 --> 28:08.160
Don't you look a picture.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.280
Shall we, squire?
Let's.

28:22.280 --> 28:24.040
TAXI ENGINE STARTS

28:39.720 --> 28:42.440
I thought, if I got a better report,
he might come back.

28:42.440 --> 28:43.840
How do you mean?

28:43.840 --> 28:45.240
From school.

28:45.240 --> 28:47.840
I got a bad report
and he was cross about it.

28:47.840 --> 28:49.960
Then he went and lived with his new
family.

28:51.760 --> 28:53.160
But...

28:53.160 --> 28:54.960
Well, that was just a coincidence.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.440
That wasn't your fault.

28:57.440 --> 28:59.400
Your mum and dad getting divorced

28:59.400 --> 29:02.400
had nothing to do with anything that
you said or did,

29:02.400 --> 29:05.000
or didn't do or say.
Do you understand?

29:06.520 --> 29:08.560
He was a good dad.

29:09.960 --> 29:12.080
Yeah, I'm sure. I'm sure.

29:12.080 --> 29:13.800
He'd let me help at the
garage sometimes

29:13.800 --> 29:16.480
when he was working on the cab.
Yeah?

29:16.480 --> 29:18.480
Did you enjoy that?

29:22.040 --> 29:24.320
Can I have my gun back?

29:24.320 --> 29:25.560
No.

29:25.560 --> 29:27.160
Er, you can't. It's...

29:27.160 --> 29:28.920
It's illegal, I'm afraid.

29:28.920 --> 29:31.760
You're just as likely to hurt
yourself with it as someone else.

29:31.760 --> 29:34.600
So, I'll keep hold of it
until you're old enough, all right?

29:36.360 --> 29:38.880
Now, go on.
Go in and give your mum a hug.

29:38.880 --> 29:40.120
Tell her you love her.

29:46.760 --> 29:49.240
DISTANT BELL TOLLS

30:12.600 --> 30:13.960

30:19.120 --> 30:20.400
DOOR CLOSES

30:23.040 --> 30:24.600
HE SIGHS WEARILY

30:28.920 --> 30:30.320
Goodnight.

30:33.040 --> 30:34.280
Can I see?

30:34.280 --> 30:36.000
Oh, certainly.

30:40.440 --> 30:41.760
It's amazing.

30:41.760 --> 30:43.520
You're very welcome to it.

30:43.520 --> 30:45.760
You mean it, I could keep it?

30:45.760 --> 30:47.400
By all means, if you'd like it.

30:48.920 --> 30:50.440
Could you sign it?

30:50.440 --> 30:51.840
Oh, now...

30:58.440 --> 31:00.120
How's that?
R Bright.

31:00.120 --> 31:01.480
What does the R stand for?

31:01.480 --> 31:02.920
Reginald.

31:02.920 --> 31:04.560
I'm Lynn.

31:04.560 --> 31:07.120
Lynn Parry.
Miss Parry, how do you do?

31:08.080 --> 31:09.480
Lynn.

31:16.400 --> 31:18.200
Mr and Mrs Denby.

31:23.320 --> 31:24.920
Mr and Mrs Cameron.

31:29.720 --> 31:32.000
Brother Strange and
Miss Joan Thursday.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.760
Worshipful Master.
Brother Strange.

31:35.720 --> 31:38.680
What a beautiful dress.
Oh, you're very kind.

31:38.680 --> 31:40.800
Not at all, it's really gorgeous.

31:40.800 --> 31:42.200
Thank you.

31:42.200 --> 31:43.840
I hope you have a lovely evening.

31:43.840 --> 31:45.160
We will, I'm sure.

31:48.560 --> 31:50.480
Mr and Mrs Stubbings.

32:21.480 --> 32:23.200
And the winner of two tickets

32:23.200 --> 32:25.800
to see The Carpenters
at the Royal Albert Hall is...

32:31.800 --> 32:33.960
..Mr James Strange
and Miss Joan Thursday!

32:33.960 --> 32:35.920
APPLAUSE

32:39.680 --> 32:40.840
Cheers!

ENTRY SYSTEM BUZZES

32:50.600 --> 32:53.320
Some of us are trying to sleep!
Oh, good evening.

32:53.320 --> 32:55.680
Never mind good evening.
What do you want?

32:56.760 --> 32:59.400
I'm looking for Miss Thursday.
Well, she's out.

33:00.600 --> 33:01.840
Out?

33:01.840 --> 33:05.160
Some bloke in an evening suit
and a private car.

33:06.600 --> 33:07.760
Oh...

33:07.760 --> 33:09.800
Was there a message?
No.

33:10.880 --> 33:12.240
No, no message.

33:17.280 --> 33:21.480
# Earth angel, Earth angel

33:21.480 --> 33:24.840
# Will you be mine?

33:24.840 --> 33:27.800
# My darling, dear

33:27.800 --> 33:31.520
# Love you all the time... #

33:31.520 --> 33:34.080
Here we go...
Thank you.

33:34.080 --> 33:37.320
All right?
So far, so good.

33:37.320 --> 33:39.560
I didn't say anything that was...?
Mm.

33:39.560 --> 33:41.640
No. No, not at all.
You were brilliant.

33:45.440 --> 33:46.480
So...

33:47.520 --> 33:49.080
..what's this all about, then, Jim?

33:50.320 --> 33:53.400
Well, it's kind of expected,
isn't it, in my line?

33:54.960 --> 33:57.720
Not many of us went to the right
kind of school, so...

33:57.720 --> 34:00.160
..this is the next best thing.
Old boy network.

34:00.160 --> 34:01.720
If you like.

34:01.720 --> 34:04.480
There's no harm in it.
The way people go on,

34:04.480 --> 34:07.320
you'd think it's all black magic and
sacrificing virgins.

34:08.440 --> 34:10.600
But somewhere in amongst all that,

34:10.600 --> 34:12.840
somehow, we manage to do
a lot of good work for charity.

34:19.400 --> 34:21.720
Did you want to, er...?

34:22.800 --> 34:24.200
Why not?

34:25.720 --> 34:27.200
Thank you.

34:29.120 --> 34:30.840
Allow me.

34:30.840 --> 34:34.640
# ..happiness

34:34.640 --> 34:38.760
# Earth angel, Earth angel

34:38.760 --> 34:42.240
# Please, be mine

34:42.240 --> 34:44.520
# My darling, dear

34:44.520 --> 34:48.440
# Love you for all time

34:48.440 --> 34:50.600
# I'm just a fool

34:52.400 --> 34:56.760
# A fool in love

34:56.760 --> 35:02.720
# With you. #

35:10.640 --> 35:12.360
LOUD THUMP,
TYRES SQUEAL

35:18.720 --> 35:20.880
Hey!

35:20.880 --> 35:23.240
Hey, what the hell
do you think you're doing?!

35:23.240 --> 35:24.560
I could've killed you!

35:24.560 --> 35:25.880
MORSE GROANS

35:25.880 --> 35:28.560
What...? Officer...

35:28.560 --> 35:30.360
..are you OK?
I'm sorry.

35:32.760 --> 35:34.400
Come on, sir.
Come on, let me help you.

35:34.400 --> 35:37.360
Who's this?
MORSE GROANS

35:39.120 --> 35:41.240
Are you OK?
Yeah, I just tripped and...

35:41.240 --> 35:43.200
..and missed my footing
a little bit.

35:44.560 --> 35:47.520
That could have happened to anyone.
Which way are you going?

35:48.760 --> 35:50.200
Erm, this way.

35:50.200 --> 35:52.280
Look, let Clarry take you home safe,
sir.

35:52.280 --> 35:54.720
Come on, the car's there, sir.
Come, come.

35:57.760 --> 35:59.400
You scared the life out of me,
man.

35:59.400 --> 36:01.160
MORSE GROANS

36:25.960 --> 36:27.200
Thank you.

36:32.720 --> 36:35.920
Well, listen,
thanks for helping me out tonight.

36:35.920 --> 36:36.960
You're welcome.

36:38.760 --> 36:41.000
Right, night, then.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.200
Night.

36:46.560 --> 36:47.960
Blimey.

36:47.960 --> 36:49.480
I won't wash my face for a week
now.

36:49.480 --> 36:52.040
SHE LAUGHS
What was that for?

36:52.040 --> 36:53.800
A lovely evening.

36:54.880 --> 36:57.160
Go on, in you go.

36:58.560 --> 37:00.000
Oh, listen, don't feel like

37:00.000 --> 37:02.880
you've got to come to The Carpenters
if it's not your...

37:02.880 --> 37:04.440
Excuse me, we won, didn't we?

37:04.440 --> 37:06.360
Yeah, but...
A night out in London?

37:06.360 --> 37:08.680
I'm not gonna turn that down.
HE CHUCKLES

37:08.680 --> 37:10.680
She does have a lovely voice.

37:10.680 --> 37:12.280
Yeah, she does.

37:15.440 --> 37:17.840
Right, then, goodnight.

37:17.840 --> 37:19.200
Goodnight.

37:35.320 --> 37:37.000
Phwoar!

37:37.000 --> 37:38.680
Nice bit of crumpet.

37:40.840 --> 37:42.920
She's not crumpet.

37:42.920 --> 37:46.240
She's a smart, bright,
independent, young woman.

37:47.240 --> 37:50.080
You'll remember it if you're looking
for a tip next time.

37:50.080 --> 37:51.560
Whatever you say, squire.

37:55.080 --> 37:56.800
TAXI ENGINE STARTS

38:20.800 --> 38:22.720
Are you all right, now?

38:22.720 --> 38:24.000
Yep.

38:31.960 --> 38:33.200
Thanks for the lift.

38:45.240 --> 38:46.680
Oh, it's all right, I've got them.

39:27.960 --> 39:29.640
Father Francis Mahoney.

39:29.640 --> 39:30.840
56.

39:31.880 --> 39:33.760
Who found him?
His housekeeper.

39:33.760 --> 39:35.040
A Mrs Walsh.

39:36.440 --> 39:38.640
She brought him a cup of tea
to his room at the rectory,

39:38.640 --> 39:40.400
only to find his bed hadn't been
slept in.

39:40.400 --> 39:43.520
So, she came in here to look for
him.

39:43.520 --> 39:45.240
She doesn't live in, then?

39:45.240 --> 39:47.160
Goes home of an evening
after he's had his tea.

39:47.160 --> 39:49.200
Then comes in first thing
to see to his breakfast.

39:52.800 --> 39:54.880
Looks to be another robbery,
in any event.

39:54.880 --> 39:57.520
Wallet's open and empty
on the floor of the confessional.

39:57.520 --> 39:59.240
THURSDAY: Anything, Doctor?

39:59.240 --> 40:00.720
I'm afraid Father Mahoney

40:00.720 --> 40:03.600
got rather more of an earful than he
was expecting.

40:04.640 --> 40:06.160
Shot through the screen.

40:06.160 --> 40:10.600
Body temperature and rigour suggests
he joined the choir invisible

40:10.600 --> 40:13.040
about 14 to 16 hours ago.

40:13.040 --> 40:16.400
That makes it sometime after last
night's seven o'clock mass.

40:16.400 --> 40:18.280
Doesn't confession happen
before mass,

40:18.280 --> 40:20.760
unless it's prearranged with
the priest?

40:20.760 --> 40:25.560
There's no exit wound this time, so
calibre will have to wait on the PM.

40:25.560 --> 40:27.240
Might we remove the body?

40:27.240 --> 40:29.360
Of course, Doctor. By any means.

40:29.360 --> 40:31.520
Very well, then.
Shall we say two o'clock?

40:36.840 --> 40:39.480
What would a taxi driver and a
priest have in common

40:39.480 --> 40:41.520
that would be of interest
to the same killer?

40:41.520 --> 40:44.120
Until we have forensics on the
bullet, we don't know they were.

40:44.120 --> 40:46.600
What, two shootings in two days
by two different killers?

40:46.600 --> 40:48.400
That hardly seems likely, does it?

40:48.400 --> 40:51.320
I went back to Cowley East to talk
to the station staff last night.

40:51.320 --> 40:52.600
The waitress at the cafe

40:52.600 --> 40:55.600
said a cleric had been in the night
that Lunn was killed.

40:55.600 --> 40:57.280
Hanging about over his coffee.

40:57.280 --> 41:00.320
Mahoney? One dog collar's much like
another.

41:00.320 --> 41:02.760
We'll see if there's any photos of
him up at the rectory

41:02.760 --> 41:04.520
and you can run it past her.
Right.

41:04.520 --> 41:06.720
She also said there was
a young woman.

41:06.720 --> 41:09.680
Blonde. Twenties.
Kept watching the cab rank.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.600
Get going with door to door.

41:12.600 --> 41:14.480
We'll brace the housekeeper.
Sir.

41:19.960 --> 41:21.680
What happened to you this morning?

41:21.680 --> 41:23.480
Oh, I'm sorry, I, er...
I missed the alarm.

41:24.480 --> 41:26.160
That shirt looks like you've slept
in it.

41:27.600 --> 41:29.160
I've got my stepmother staying
with me

41:29.160 --> 41:30.800
until she moves into a place
in Eynsham.

41:30.800 --> 41:32.280
I'm on the sofa. It's not ideal.

41:32.280 --> 41:34.200
Still no excuse for
a grubby shirt.

41:34.200 --> 41:36.440
Slovenly dress leads
to a slovenly mind.

41:36.440 --> 41:38.720
If more connects these cases than
robbery,

41:38.720 --> 41:40.680
then I'll need you to earn
your keep.

41:40.680 --> 41:42.480
Well, I wasn't completely idle
last night.

41:42.480 --> 41:43.920
I went back to where Lunn
was shot.

41:43.920 --> 41:45.560
I almost went the same way myself.

41:45.560 --> 41:48.200
His son was lying in wait in case
the killer returned to the scene.

41:49.240 --> 41:51.320
You mean, he was armed?
Yeah, a .22 pistol.

41:51.320 --> 41:53.160
Same as did for his old man.

41:53.160 --> 41:55.480
Don't worry, I took it off him,
and then drove him home.

41:55.480 --> 41:57.680
But while I was there,
I found part of a metal canister

41:57.680 --> 41:59.400
on the verge by where the taxi
was parked.

41:59.400 --> 42:01.280
What sort of canister?
I couldn't say.

42:01.280 --> 42:03.160
I'd intended to take it to this
naturist camp,

42:03.160 --> 42:04.360
but with the boy on board...

42:04.360 --> 42:06.080
Pass it to Forensics for prints,

42:06.080 --> 42:08.560
along with the pistol for
comparison testing.

42:19.080 --> 42:22.040
Do you want to come down?
No, you're all right.

42:22.040 --> 42:24.200
Mrs Walsh said it would be all right
to carry on.

42:24.200 --> 42:25.640
Well, I'm saying it's not.

42:25.640 --> 42:28.360
So, if you don't get down here and
give your details to my sergeant,

42:28.360 --> 42:29.960
you'll have my foot up your arse!

42:29.960 --> 42:32.160
Come on, Pops, don't be uptight.
I've got a rota.

42:32.160 --> 42:33.960
If I don't do them now,
it'll put me all out.

42:33.960 --> 42:36.480
I'll put you all out
if you don't get down that ladder!

42:36.480 --> 42:38.400
All right, all right,
keep your hat on.

42:42.400 --> 42:44.800
Blimey, what's the matter with him?
Ain't he getting any?

42:44.800 --> 42:47.480
Name, address and date of birth,
please. Lee Timothy.

42:47.480 --> 42:50.120
3 The Sidings, Jericho.

42:50.120 --> 42:52.480
12th October, 1950.

42:52.480 --> 42:54.800
When was the last time
you saw Father Mahoney?

42:54.800 --> 42:57.600
Six weeks.
The last time I did his windows.

42:57.600 --> 43:00.640
Did he ever mention any trouble
he was having?

43:00.640 --> 43:02.520
Any difficulties with his
parishioners?

43:02.520 --> 43:04.240
To his window cleaner?

43:04.240 --> 43:05.680
No.

43:06.880 --> 43:08.480
Right.

43:08.480 --> 43:10.720
Funny enough...

43:10.720 --> 43:13.240
..I did hear him have a bit of a
ding-dong last I was here.

43:13.240 --> 43:15.280
I was aloft doing the window.

43:15.280 --> 43:17.800
He was having a right old go at
someone in the front bedroom.

43:17.800 --> 43:18.880
The top bay.

43:19.960 --> 43:22.840
Did you hear what he was saying,
or see who he was talking to?

43:22.840 --> 43:25.200
No, not who was with him, but...

43:25.200 --> 43:27.720
..I saw a trilby on the hall table.

43:27.720 --> 43:30.680
Little orange feather in the band.
Too racy for the Father.

43:30.680 --> 43:33.360
What time was this?
Early doors.

43:33.360 --> 43:35.960
Right, I think that will be all for
now, Mr Timothy, thank you.

43:35.960 --> 43:37.800
If we need anything else,
we'll be in touch.

43:37.800 --> 43:39.640
WOMAN:
His ministry had taken him all over.

43:40.680 --> 43:42.880
He'd been a padre in the war,
I think.

43:42.880 --> 43:44.520
And a prison chaplain, too.

43:45.480 --> 43:47.880
Did he have any family
that you know of?

43:47.880 --> 43:50.680
He had a half-brother come by
from time to time.

43:50.680 --> 43:52.200
Donal.

43:53.400 --> 43:55.720
But things weren't all that good
between them.

43:56.880 --> 43:57.960
No?

43:57.960 --> 43:59.600
How's that?

43:59.600 --> 44:01.680
He turned up every few months...

44:02.720 --> 44:04.680
..like the proverbial bad penny.

44:04.680 --> 44:06.440
After money from the Father.

44:06.440 --> 44:09.080
I told him
I thought he was taking advantage.

44:10.040 --> 44:11.520
The Father said...

44:12.600 --> 44:15.520
.."Am I not my brother's keeper,
Roisin?"

44:17.520 --> 44:19.320
"Am I not my brother's keeper?"

44:29.360 --> 44:31.560
Afternoon, Mrs Appleby.
Afternoon.

44:36.880 --> 44:37.960
Baz!

44:37.960 --> 44:39.520
Where the hell have you been?

44:39.520 --> 44:42.000
I've been going out of my mind.
It's not a big deal.

44:42.000 --> 44:43.600
I just had to get away.

44:43.600 --> 44:45.960
From me?
No, from here.

44:45.960 --> 44:48.920
It was just for an hour or two.
Baz, you've been gone all night.

44:48.920 --> 44:50.520
Where did you go?

44:50.520 --> 44:52.240
A pub in town.

44:53.440 --> 44:55.280
An old haunt
from when I was an undergrad.

44:56.680 --> 44:59.880
I had too much to drink and
passed out on Christchurch Meadow.

45:03.840 --> 45:05.400
But I'm back now.

45:05.400 --> 45:07.760
I'll try and make a go of it.
You don't have to.

45:09.080 --> 45:11.240
You can just go.
No, I'd like to.

45:11.240 --> 45:12.880
Really.

45:12.880 --> 45:14.840
I'll get over my hang-ups and...

45:16.080 --> 45:17.640
..we've paid for the week.

45:17.640 --> 45:19.880
Let's just try and enjoy it.

45:19.880 --> 45:20.960
Yes?

45:53.800 --> 45:56.160
Anything from lippy?
No, nothing much.

45:56.160 --> 45:59.120
Oh, other than he overheard Mahoney
arguing with someone in his bedroom

45:59.120 --> 46:00.360
the last time he was here.

46:00.360 --> 46:03.040
Man or woman?
He couldn't say.

46:03.040 --> 46:06.360
Though he did see a trilby through
the window with an orange feather.

46:06.360 --> 46:08.280
Not Mahoney's.
So, presumably, a man.

46:08.280 --> 46:10.160
Could be his half-brother Donal.

46:12.360 --> 46:13.760
Well, there's a...

46:13.760 --> 46:16.720
There's a "call D" in his diary.

46:16.720 --> 46:18.480
And his last appointment is
confession.

46:18.480 --> 46:20.280
8:00pm.
Ringed and underlined.

46:20.280 --> 46:22.560
Kept by his killer, presumably.

46:22.560 --> 46:23.920
Mm.

46:25.080 --> 46:26.400
DOOR CLOSES

46:42.400 --> 46:44.600
The fruit of my labour.

46:44.600 --> 46:49.360
.22, the same calibre as did for
Mr Lunn.

46:49.360 --> 46:52.960
By your leave, I'll pass it to
Forensic Ballistics for comparison.

46:52.960 --> 46:54.360
See if we have a match.

46:54.360 --> 46:57.000
Well, I can't imagine we've too many
robbers going round Oxford

46:57.000 --> 46:58.960
knocking people off with a
.22 pistol.

47:03.720 --> 47:04.800
Three feathers.

47:04.800 --> 47:06.760
That was on Lunn's membership card,
wasn't it?

47:06.760 --> 47:08.600
Mm, The Ostrich Fanciers' Club.

47:08.600 --> 47:11.840
"From the boys on D wing,
Wandsworth."

47:11.840 --> 47:15.040
His housekeeper said
he was a prison chaplain.

47:15.040 --> 47:17.400
It's a funny robbery
that leaves a pocket watch.

47:17.400 --> 47:19.680
And it's smashed again.

47:19.680 --> 47:22.000
Two broken timepieces?

47:22.000 --> 47:24.040
The killer's motif, perhaps?

47:24.040 --> 47:26.160
Do you still think it was just
a robbery?

47:26.160 --> 47:27.720
3:50...

47:27.720 --> 47:29.120
So, what's he after?

47:29.120 --> 47:31.880
Trying to fix a false time
to give himself an alibi, maybe?

47:31.880 --> 47:34.040
Well, if that's his purpose,
it's pretty redundant.

47:35.720 --> 47:38.160
We know from Doctor DeBryn
and from his appointment book

47:38.160 --> 47:39.800
that Father Mahoney was shot
at 8:00.

47:39.800 --> 47:43.000
Well, whatever it means, I'd better
get back and brief Mr Bright.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.840
Two deaths in as many days isn't
gonna go down well at Division.

47:45.840 --> 47:47.440
You can bank on it.

47:47.440 --> 47:50.320
I'll get back to the rectory, see if
there's anything that this fits.

47:50.320 --> 47:52.480
There was a wardrobe
that I couldn't get into.

47:52.480 --> 47:54.640
Just to make sure
nothing's been overlooked.

49:06.960 --> 49:11.040
BRIGHT:
A taxi driver, and now a priest.

49:11.040 --> 49:12.800
Anything to connect them?

49:12.800 --> 49:17.160
We've no reason to believe the dead
men were known to each other, sir.

49:17.160 --> 49:20.120
Well, whoever's behind it, you need
to find them, Thursday, and fast.

49:20.120 --> 49:22.520
I've already had Division on.

49:22.520 --> 49:26.560
If this is some lunatic murdering
strangers at random for money...

49:27.800 --> 49:30.440
..he's got 130,000 potential victims
to choose from,

49:30.440 --> 49:32.520
and we've no way of knowing
who's going to be next.

50:25.800 --> 50:27.320
DOOR BANGS SHUT

50:31.960 --> 50:33.920
APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS

50:37.720 --> 50:39.680
Can't you wear a bell
around your neck?

50:39.680 --> 50:42.040
Sorry.
I've always been light of foot.

50:42.040 --> 50:44.560
What are you doing skulking
in there?

50:44.560 --> 50:47.320
Looking for absolution?
It's too late for me.

50:47.320 --> 50:48.400
I'm past saving.

50:48.400 --> 50:50.520
It's never too late for the
Almighty.

50:50.520 --> 50:52.520
"Though your sins be as scarlet..."

50:52.520 --> 50:54.640
Did you know him?
What was he like?

50:55.920 --> 50:57.840
Whisky priest.

50:57.840 --> 51:00.080
They get that look sometimes,
clergy. That...

51:00.080 --> 51:03.960
..over-the-shoulder
hunted cast to the eye,

51:03.960 --> 51:06.360
as if they'll be discovered in their
doubt.

51:06.360 --> 51:08.080
You mean, he lost his faith?

51:08.080 --> 51:09.720
Well, there's a lot of it about.

51:13.600 --> 51:15.760
Have you ever heard of
The Ostrich Fanciers' Club?

51:15.760 --> 51:17.520
No, that's new to me.

51:17.520 --> 51:19.280
Where is it?
I don't know.

51:19.280 --> 51:22.480
I'm not even sure what kind of
club it is. I can ask around.

51:25.120 --> 51:28.160
PROJECTOR WHIRS

51:31.200 --> 51:33.280
Aye-aye, what's this, then?

51:33.280 --> 51:34.920
A magic lantern show?

51:34.920 --> 51:36.480
In a manner of speaking.

51:38.120 --> 51:40.880
Oh! Blimey!

51:41.880 --> 51:44.920
Morse found a bunch of them
in a wardrobe up at the rectory.

51:44.920 --> 51:46.600
All right, Morse.

51:46.600 --> 51:48.640
We get the general idea.

51:48.640 --> 51:50.680
MORSE TURNS THE PROJECTOR OFF

51:50.680 --> 51:52.320
Pornography?

51:52.320 --> 51:54.640
That's not Oxford business.
That's London business.

51:54.640 --> 51:57.560
An hour's run up the A40
makes it everybody's business.

51:58.680 --> 52:00.600
I've got an old colleague in the
Dirty Squad.

52:00.600 --> 52:02.040
I'll see if he can shed any light.

52:03.280 --> 52:06.080
Well, it wasn't Father Mahoney
at the station cafe.

52:06.080 --> 52:08.880
I showed his photo to the waitress.
She said it was another fella.

52:08.880 --> 52:11.040
Hello, hello, that's, er...

52:11.040 --> 52:12.880
..a Masonic apron.
Yeah, we know.

52:12.880 --> 52:14.640
It was with the blue films
in the bag.

52:14.640 --> 52:17.320
Well, it couldn't have been Father
Mahoney's. The Pope stuck a ban

52:17.320 --> 52:19.680
on Romans joining the Brotherhood
nearly 200 years back.

52:19.680 --> 52:21.800
His brother Donal, maybe.

52:21.800 --> 52:24.200
He sounds like a wrong 'un.
Sir...

52:26.240 --> 52:27.560
These canisters...

52:28.600 --> 52:30.240
A tin can, you say?

52:31.560 --> 52:34.160
Well, you find all sorts
in hedgerows.

52:34.160 --> 52:36.280
No, it was half a canister.

52:36.280 --> 52:38.800
It may have contained
eight millimetre film stock.

52:38.800 --> 52:41.720
Well, we have a film show once a
week for the guests.

52:41.720 --> 52:45.320
We've a small library of them,
but they're all 16 mil.

52:46.560 --> 52:50.040
The couple that heard the shot,
Major, Mr and Mrs Appleby,

52:50.040 --> 52:52.520
when did they arrive?
Friday evening.

52:52.520 --> 52:55.200
We gave them their flower garlands
by way of a welcome.

52:55.200 --> 52:56.720
I asked if they wanted to dine,

52:56.720 --> 52:59.640
but they were very tired and wanted
to get straight to bed.

52:59.640 --> 53:01.560
We didn't see them again till
morning.

53:01.560 --> 53:04.520
We were going to drive up,
but then we thought,

53:04.520 --> 53:07.160
if we really are going to get back
to nature

53:07.160 --> 53:09.640
we ought to take the train
and get a cab.

53:09.640 --> 53:12.040
And can you describe the driver?

53:12.040 --> 53:13.640
The driver?
Mm-hm.

53:13.640 --> 53:15.280
Oh, yes.

53:15.280 --> 53:16.920
THURSDAY: You lied to us.

53:16.920 --> 53:18.120
Turns out you were the one

53:18.120 --> 53:20.160
who dropped the Applebys at Paradise
Court

53:20.160 --> 53:21.960
the same night as the murder.

53:23.040 --> 53:26.920
I can see I should have mentioned
it, but I've had a lot on my mind.

53:28.000 --> 53:29.960
My wife's been sick, sir.

53:29.960 --> 53:32.440
Back and forth to the doctor.
I'm sorry to hear it.

53:32.440 --> 53:34.040
And where were you last night?

53:35.160 --> 53:37.240
Well, now, sir,
you know where I was.

53:37.240 --> 53:39.240
I had a little accident with the
officer.

53:39.240 --> 53:42.480
But I made sure he was all right
and took him home.

53:43.800 --> 53:45.440
Before that.

53:46.480 --> 53:48.280
Oh...

53:48.280 --> 53:50.440
I had fares all over.

53:50.440 --> 53:51.880
Anything take you near St Agnes?

53:53.360 --> 53:55.360
No, sir, I don't believe it did.

53:56.720 --> 53:59.320
And was everything all right
between you and Mr Lunn?

53:59.320 --> 54:01.440
Me and Dudley?
Yeah.

54:01.440 --> 54:04.280
Yeah, sure,
we was good friends, you know.

54:05.880 --> 54:09.920
Ask any of the men on the rank.
No money worries or anything?

54:09.920 --> 54:13.240
It's just I found this marker
in the back of your cab last night.

54:13.240 --> 54:16.800
It's an IOU for £25
on the back of a Speedy Cabs card

54:16.800 --> 54:18.880
and signed by Mr Lunn.

54:18.880 --> 54:21.200
Oh, now, see, sir, that...

54:21.200 --> 54:23.880
That was just a little private
matter between us.

54:25.000 --> 54:27.720
Besides, Dudley paid all of that
back a long time ago.

54:27.720 --> 54:30.400
In my experience, Mr Haynes,
when a debt is paid,

54:30.400 --> 54:32.160
the marker's returned to the debtor.

54:32.160 --> 54:33.760
Else destroyed.

54:33.760 --> 54:35.480
Also, £25, what's that?

54:35.480 --> 54:37.360
A week's wages or more.

54:37.360 --> 54:38.920
Well, sir...

54:38.920 --> 54:42.120
..we all puts a little bit by for a
rainy day, don't we?

54:42.120 --> 54:45.920
But you can see why we're finding it
difficult to believe

54:45.920 --> 54:48.280
that you being out at Paradise Court

54:48.280 --> 54:51.480
on the same night that a man,
who owes you money, is shot dead

54:51.480 --> 54:53.480
is something that might
just slip your mind.

54:53.480 --> 54:54.680
Look...

54:54.680 --> 54:56.640
Maybe I should've said something.

54:57.640 --> 55:00.080
But I didn't want to get involved
in that kind of trouble.

55:00.080 --> 55:02.040
Murder trouble, you know.

55:03.320 --> 55:05.120
I'm just a taxi driver.

55:06.320 --> 55:08.680
I mind my business.

55:14.760 --> 55:16.520
Mr and Mrs Maynard?

55:16.520 --> 55:18.560
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.

55:18.560 --> 55:20.120
Thank you.

55:20.120 --> 55:21.720
Farewell, my dear.

55:21.720 --> 55:23.400
Have a lovely trip.
Thank you.

55:23.400 --> 55:26.080
See you in a few days, darling.
I'll get the door.

55:29.560 --> 55:30.960
And here's your coat.

55:34.400 --> 55:35.680
Thank you.

55:35.680 --> 55:37.240
Drive safely.
Will do.

55:40.720 --> 55:43.040
Right, to the station, then.

55:43.040 --> 55:44.360
TAXI ENGINE STARTS

56:03.640 --> 56:07.600
Well, if this is what you get up to
living here by yourself,

56:07.600 --> 56:11.000
no wonder you can't get a decent
girl to look at you.

56:11.000 --> 56:12.600
It's evidence.

56:12.600 --> 56:14.520
In a murder case.

56:18.320 --> 56:21.800
There's more to the world
than you find in Reveille, Gwen.

56:22.920 --> 56:25.600
And you'd know all about it,
I'm sure.

56:25.600 --> 56:27.520
Because you went to Oxford.

56:29.080 --> 56:31.600
But you didn't finish it, though,
did you?

56:31.600 --> 56:34.960
For all your books
and your poetry...

56:34.960 --> 56:37.080
..and your snooty music...

56:38.680 --> 56:40.600
..you failed.
Yep!

56:40.600 --> 56:41.680
Yep, I failed.

56:42.760 --> 56:45.360
I should have stayed at home and...

56:45.360 --> 56:47.120
..drove a taxi, like my father.

56:48.120 --> 56:50.320
And then got one of the local girls
knocked up.

56:50.320 --> 56:53.520
Then you could look down your nose
at me, and all would be well

56:53.520 --> 56:55.920
in your tiny, little world.

56:58.480 --> 57:01.440
You were always a strange one.

57:01.440 --> 57:03.760
Close and private.

57:03.760 --> 57:06.480
Filled with your sweaty,
little secrets.

57:07.720 --> 57:10.960
You were a disappointment to him.
So you said.

57:10.960 --> 57:13.360
A big disappointment.
So you said.

57:13.360 --> 57:15.240
I didn't kill her!

57:17.480 --> 57:18.840
What?

57:20.840 --> 57:22.600
I didn't give her cancer.

57:23.800 --> 57:27.200
And you can't blame me
all your life.

57:39.160 --> 57:40.560
I've got work to do.

57:41.920 --> 57:43.280
Goodnight, Gwen.

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
PROJECTOR WHIRS INTO LIFE

57:49.400 --> 57:51.240
We took you in.

58:19.080 --> 58:20.800
THURSDAY:
It's Lunn? You're sure?

58:20.800 --> 58:23.480
It's definitely him. He's in two or
three of the pictures.

58:23.480 --> 58:25.320
That's his connection
to Father Mahoney.

58:25.320 --> 58:27.760
Lunn's a performer in these blue
films, which...

58:29.200 --> 58:31.280
There's no need to clam up on my
account.

58:31.280 --> 58:33.480
TELEPHONE RINGS
Oh, I'll get it.

58:33.480 --> 58:37.600
I was in Blackpool with the ATS
for two years during the war.

58:38.520 --> 58:39.640
And there was this man

58:39.640 --> 58:42.200
and he kept asking me if he could
measure my feet.

58:42.200 --> 58:45.040
I know, it takes all sorts, but...

58:45.040 --> 58:46.400
..there we go.

58:48.280 --> 58:49.600
You're looking tired.

58:50.560 --> 58:52.040
It's work.

58:54.160 --> 58:55.920
You must look after yourself.

58:57.680 --> 58:59.560
We all think a lot of you, you know?

59:01.880 --> 59:04.040
I'm sorry you've had a bad go.

59:05.960 --> 59:07.920
Right.
Well...

59:09.080 --> 59:11.480
Come home safe, Dad.

59:11.480 --> 59:12.600
Morse.

59:13.840 --> 59:15.440
That was the factory.

59:45.360 --> 59:48.720
He's the Worshipful Master
at my lodge.

59:48.720 --> 59:51.000
Commodore Maynard.
Harry Maynard.

59:52.280 --> 59:55.240
I only saw him the night before last
at the, er...

59:55.240 --> 59:56.880
..the lodge.

59:56.880 --> 59:58.320
Who found him?

59:58.320 --> 59:59.800
A beat constable.

59:59.800 --> 1:00:01.360
Anonymous tip-off.

1:00:01.360 --> 1:00:03.240
Next door thought they heard a
pistol crack

1:00:03.240 --> 1:00:05.040
about nine o'clock last night.

1:00:05.040 --> 1:00:06.840
That would chime with the
grandfather.

1:00:08.680 --> 1:00:10.800
Morning, gentlemen.
Doctor.

1:00:10.800 --> 1:00:12.440
Oh, yes.

1:00:12.440 --> 1:00:14.040
That does look nasty.

1:00:14.040 --> 1:00:18.080
You seem to be making a habit of
collecting these, Chief Inspector.

1:00:18.080 --> 1:00:19.520
Shot?

1:00:19.520 --> 1:00:22.920
In the back of the head
at point-blank range

1:00:22.920 --> 1:00:25.240
would be my first impression.

1:00:25.240 --> 1:00:26.920
Three in as many days.

1:00:26.920 --> 1:00:28.120
Oh...

1:00:28.120 --> 1:00:31.400
And I think his wife has just
arrived by taxi.

1:00:42.400 --> 1:00:43.920
Good heavens, it's...

1:00:43.920 --> 1:00:45.960
Detective Sergeant Strange,
Mrs Maynard.

1:00:45.960 --> 1:00:47.920
If we could speak inside.

1:00:52.840 --> 1:00:55.680
Where have you come from?
The station.

1:00:55.680 --> 1:00:58.240
I picked her up from here
and dropped her there last night.

1:00:58.240 --> 1:01:00.880
What time was this?
Er, 5:45.

1:01:00.880 --> 1:01:02.600
Something like that.

1:01:02.600 --> 1:01:05.160
She'd booked a return
for 9:30 this morning.

1:01:06.720 --> 1:01:08.880
Look, can I go now?
I've got a pick up in Headington.

1:01:08.880 --> 1:01:10.920
Brian's not turned in
and Ifan's doing his nut.

1:01:10.920 --> 1:01:13.280
No, I'd like you to give this
officer a formal statement

1:01:13.280 --> 1:01:14.960
and then you can leave.

1:01:14.960 --> 1:01:17.080
Go on.

1:01:17.080 --> 1:01:18.800
Are you OK?

1:01:18.800 --> 1:01:20.840
Three shootings in a week?
Shh...

1:01:22.040 --> 1:01:24.320
Here...
What's this?

1:01:24.320 --> 1:01:25.840
It's your Ostrich Fanciers' Club.

1:01:25.840 --> 1:01:28.400
One of the classified ads boys
recognised the name.

1:01:28.400 --> 1:01:31.200
"The glamour of exotic rare
birds." Mm-hm.

1:01:31.200 --> 1:01:32.840
"Films £1.

1:01:32.840 --> 1:01:37.560
"Send a stamped address envelope
to The Ostrich Fanciers' Club,

1:01:37.560 --> 1:01:40.200
"The Rectory,
12 Cloister Walk, Oxon."

1:01:41.720 --> 1:01:43.280
Exotic rare birds?

1:01:44.440 --> 1:01:46.960
For the one-in-the-hand brigade,
I fancy,

1:01:46.960 --> 1:01:49.520
rather than the two-in-the-bush
contingent. Ah...!

1:01:49.520 --> 1:01:50.880
Right.

1:01:50.880 --> 1:01:52.560
Happy to be of personal service.

1:01:52.560 --> 1:01:53.960
Thank you.

1:02:38.520 --> 1:02:41.440
We understand he was involved in the
Masonic Order.

1:02:41.440 --> 1:02:43.240
Is that right?

1:02:43.240 --> 1:02:45.440
He was in charge of the lodge.

1:02:45.440 --> 1:02:48.360
TEARFULLY: We only had our ladies'
night this week.

1:02:48.360 --> 1:02:50.280
He was so proud.

1:02:50.280 --> 1:02:51.800
Mrs Maynard...

1:02:51.800 --> 1:02:54.880
..does The Ostrich Fanciers' Club
mean anything to you?

1:02:54.880 --> 1:02:56.560
No.

1:02:56.560 --> 1:02:58.400
Nothing at all. Should it?

1:03:01.200 --> 1:03:03.040
Oh, now, that's a shame.

1:03:03.040 --> 1:03:04.760
The clock's broken, sir.

1:03:05.840 --> 1:03:08.560
And it always kept such good time.

1:03:08.560 --> 1:03:11.040
Harry wouldn't have had it in the
house otherwise.

1:03:32.200 --> 1:03:33.880
Sir...

1:03:33.880 --> 1:03:36.800
There are two indentations
in the flower bed,

1:03:36.800 --> 1:03:38.560
spaced about a foot apart.

1:03:38.560 --> 1:03:40.600
I think I know who made the tip-off
call.

1:03:40.600 --> 1:03:42.200
A ladder, you mean?

1:03:42.200 --> 1:03:44.720
Well, if Acacia Avenue
is on Lee Timothy's round,

1:03:44.720 --> 1:03:46.720
I can understand why
he wouldn't want to be found

1:03:46.720 --> 1:03:48.240
at the scene of a murder two days
running.

1:03:48.240 --> 1:03:50.560
What's all that about
Maynard's carriage clock?

1:03:50.560 --> 1:03:53.400
Changing the time seems to be the
killer's calling card.

1:03:53.400 --> 1:03:54.920
Though, God knows why.

1:03:54.920 --> 1:03:56.800
What do you think, Morse?
I've...

1:03:58.280 --> 1:04:01.200
I've seen this room before.
What, been here, you mean?

1:04:01.200 --> 1:04:04.400
This is the room where
Dudley Lunn's blue film was shot.

1:04:09.480 --> 1:04:11.440
But you can see why
I didn't want to get involved.

1:04:11.440 --> 1:04:12.600
Two people dead on the round

1:04:12.600 --> 1:04:14.400
in two days could play havoc
on my goodwill.

1:04:14.400 --> 1:04:16.920
I'm Squeegee Lee, not Typhoid Mary!

1:04:16.920 --> 1:04:19.480
How well did you know the
Maynards? They're customers.

1:04:19.480 --> 1:04:22.240
I clean the windows, they pay me.
That's it.

1:04:25.960 --> 1:04:27.880
And where were you last night
at nine o'clock?

1:04:27.880 --> 1:04:30.040
Meeting my bird, wasn't I?

1:04:30.040 --> 1:04:31.760
She works of an evening part-time.

1:04:31.760 --> 1:04:34.000
Gets off about 10:00
and I walk her home.

1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:36.880
So, no-one can vouch for your
movements last night at 9:00?

1:04:38.440 --> 1:04:42.160
Not when you put it like that.
No.

1:04:43.720 --> 1:04:45.440
Right.

1:05:11.960 --> 1:05:13.840
TELEPHONE RINGS

1:05:18.040 --> 1:05:20.160
RINGING CONTINUES

1:05:25.200 --> 1:05:26.320
Morse.

1:05:26.320 --> 1:05:27.560
Ah, Morse.

1:05:27.560 --> 1:05:29.920
I was hoping for a few words
with DCI Thursday.

1:05:29.920 --> 1:05:31.920
He's gone to London, sir.

1:05:31.920 --> 1:05:34.320
Looking for a lead
on this Ostrich Fanciers' Club.

1:05:34.320 --> 1:05:36.800
We think Father Mahoney's
step-brother,

1:05:36.800 --> 1:05:38.400
Donal, might be involved.

1:05:38.400 --> 1:05:41.480
This smutty films case,
wretched business.

1:05:41.480 --> 1:05:44.040
Very well. Keep me apprised
of any developments.

1:05:44.040 --> 1:05:45.800
Carry on.
Sir.

1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:51.320
Ah, matey, glad I caught you.

1:05:51.320 --> 1:05:53.800
I've got this woman
being knocked about by her husband.

1:05:53.800 --> 1:05:56.280
Uniform would like us to take a
statement.

1:05:56.280 --> 1:05:57.760
Can you deal?

1:05:57.760 --> 1:06:00.000
Well, it's that or watching DeBryn

1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:02.400
rooting around Maynard's brain pan
at the postmortem.

1:06:02.400 --> 1:06:03.920
I thought you'd sooner the frail.

1:06:10.000 --> 1:06:11.480
WOMAN: I won't press charges.

1:06:11.480 --> 1:06:13.280
It's my fault. I provoked him.

1:06:13.280 --> 1:06:15.960
There's nothing you could have done
that would warrant this.

1:06:16.920 --> 1:06:17.960
I met somebody.

1:06:19.480 --> 1:06:21.000
I went with him.

1:06:22.560 --> 1:06:24.280
And your husband found out?

1:06:25.640 --> 1:06:28.200
And who was he, this other man?

1:06:28.200 --> 1:06:31.680
I don't want him getting in any
trouble. Please, Mrs Grady.

1:06:33.840 --> 1:06:35.240
It's Dudley.

1:06:35.240 --> 1:06:36.640
Dudley Lunn.

1:06:36.640 --> 1:06:38.160
SHE SNIFFLES

1:06:41.320 --> 1:06:43.560
Where can I find your husband?

1:06:45.360 --> 1:06:47.240
He's at a place called
Paradise Court.

1:06:47.240 --> 1:06:49.080
But I don't want to press
any charges.

1:06:49.080 --> 1:06:50.760
Mrs Grady?

1:06:50.760 --> 1:06:52.720
Joan Thursday, Welfare Officer.

1:06:52.720 --> 1:06:55.800
You don't have to talk to Detective
Sergeant Morse if you don't want to.

1:06:55.800 --> 1:06:57.640
I've told him
I don't want to press charges.

1:06:57.640 --> 1:06:58.840
Please...

1:06:58.840 --> 1:07:01.160
Well, then, that should be enough.

1:07:03.800 --> 1:07:05.160
Thank you, Officer.

1:07:06.680 --> 1:07:09.920
Well, if you change your mind,
you can find me at Castle Gate.

1:08:08.720 --> 1:08:10.720
Are you sure about Grady?
I'm not sure, no.

1:08:10.720 --> 1:08:12.880
But it's a bit of a coincidence
that his wife's lover

1:08:12.880 --> 1:08:16.080
is killed on a country lane
not far from where he works.

1:08:16.080 --> 1:08:18.800
Good evening. We're looking for
your groundsman, Del Grady.

1:08:18.800 --> 1:08:21.640
We've tried his home, to no avail.
WOMAN SCREAMS

1:08:21.640 --> 1:08:24.560
SCREAMING AND WAILING

1:08:31.200 --> 1:08:33.920
SHE SOBS AND WAILS

1:08:49.280 --> 1:08:51.240
STRANGE:
Some sort of Peeping Tom?

1:08:51.240 --> 1:08:53.800
MORSE:
A groundsman at a naturist camp,

1:08:53.800 --> 1:08:55.200
it's hard to imagine a position

1:08:55.200 --> 1:08:57.440
that affords greater opportunity
for voyeurism.

1:08:59.400 --> 1:09:01.600
Anything out of the ordinary, Doc?

1:09:01.600 --> 1:09:03.440
All too ordinary, I'm afraid.

1:09:03.440 --> 1:09:06.200
The postmortem may say otherwise.

1:09:06.200 --> 1:09:08.080
But at first glance,

1:09:08.080 --> 1:09:10.600
there's nothing to say
it's other than it looks.

1:09:10.600 --> 1:09:13.640
Suicide. For the Coroner to decide,
of course.

1:09:13.640 --> 1:09:17.480
But there's a strong smell of liquor
about the corpus.

1:09:17.480 --> 1:09:21.760
Alcohol taken to excess
is a notorious depressant,

1:09:21.760 --> 1:09:24.960
and we rarely make wise choices
when inebriated.

1:09:27.400 --> 1:09:29.640
Anyway, er, shall we say nine
of the clock?

1:09:29.640 --> 1:09:31.320
Mm-hm.
Doctor.

1:09:31.320 --> 1:09:32.600
Morse.

1:09:36.360 --> 1:09:37.680
So...

1:09:39.240 --> 1:09:41.720
..he puts his wife in hospital...

1:09:41.720 --> 1:09:43.880
..then does for himself
in a fit of remorse, then?

1:09:43.880 --> 1:09:45.280
Or it's what he did to Lunn

1:09:45.280 --> 1:09:48.040
and the others that just pushed him
over the edge.

1:09:49.400 --> 1:09:50.800
I can see Lunn,

1:09:50.800 --> 1:09:53.040
if he was carrying on with
Mrs Grady.

1:09:53.040 --> 1:09:56.120
But where's your motive for Father
Mahoney and Commodore Maynard?

1:09:56.120 --> 1:09:59.320
They can't have been seeing her,
too.

1:09:59.320 --> 1:10:00.960
I'll get on for a search warrant.

1:10:00.960 --> 1:10:03.080
But unless Grady has a .22 pistol
at home,

1:10:03.080 --> 1:10:05.400
we're gonna have to look elsewhere
for a killer.

1:10:54.280 --> 1:10:56.000
It was just a mistake.

1:10:57.760 --> 1:10:59.840
A silly, youthful indiscretion.

1:11:02.360 --> 1:11:03.840
Did you meet him...

1:11:04.920 --> 1:11:07.000
..the other night, down by the lane?

1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:08.880
Only, my colleague found a
paper flower

1:11:08.880 --> 1:11:10.600
out by where Lunn's taxi
was parked.

1:11:10.600 --> 1:11:12.040
And I know that you and your wife

1:11:12.040 --> 1:11:14.640
were given Hawaiian garlands
the evening you arrived.

1:11:16.880 --> 1:11:19.040
I just wanted to clear the air.

1:11:19.040 --> 1:11:23.000
To make plain that whatever youthful
indiscretion had taken place

1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:24.720
belonged in the past.

1:11:24.720 --> 1:11:26.520
I'm a married man now.

1:11:26.520 --> 1:11:28.360
And so was Del. Well, he was.

1:11:28.360 --> 1:11:29.560
But far less happy than you.

1:11:29.560 --> 1:11:32.240
How did he take that?

1:11:32.240 --> 1:11:33.480
Not well.

1:11:34.920 --> 1:11:39.080
He was trapped in a marriage
with someone he didn't care for.

1:11:40.560 --> 1:11:43.680
He'd only gone through with it
because it was expected of him,

1:11:43.680 --> 1:11:45.680
and to please his family.

1:11:45.680 --> 1:11:48.680
So, that's where you were
when you heard the gunshot.

1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:52.440
And rather than having to answer
any awkward questions

1:11:52.440 --> 1:11:54.000
about what you both were doing
there,

1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:55.480
you agreed to keep quiet about it.

1:11:57.600 --> 1:11:59.320
Del begged me to meet him in town

1:11:59.320 --> 1:12:02.000
the following evening to finish
our talk.

1:12:03.120 --> 1:12:05.920
I'm afraid I left
him with no illusions.

1:12:09.160 --> 1:12:10.440
Or hope.

1:12:17.840 --> 1:12:20.320
Does Mrs Appleby know about your,
erm...

1:12:20.320 --> 1:12:22.320
.."youthful indiscretion"?

1:12:22.320 --> 1:12:24.720
No, of course not.

1:12:24.720 --> 1:12:26.520
Right, well, thank you.

1:12:26.520 --> 1:12:29.160
We'll be in touch
if we need any more information.

1:12:42.520 --> 1:12:44.280
HE KNOCKS ON THE DOOR

1:13:00.840 --> 1:13:02.800
DOOR OPENS

1:13:19.440 --> 1:13:21.760
I'm after Dinner For Three.

1:13:28.080 --> 1:13:30.320
Outside, all of you!

1:13:34.960 --> 1:13:36.720
DOOR CLOSES

1:13:36.720 --> 1:13:38.800
I know you've been a long time
out of the Smoke, Fred,

1:13:38.800 --> 1:13:40.520
but it's still manners to
pay your respects

1:13:40.520 --> 1:13:42.120
when you come on somebody else's
patch.

1:13:42.120 --> 1:13:45.120
I didn't like to bother you, Len.
It's no bother.

1:13:45.120 --> 1:13:48.200
And it's Commander Dury these
days. Oh...

1:13:48.200 --> 1:13:49.520
For what it's worth.

1:13:50.680 --> 1:13:52.520
You've been talking to Ches Finch.

1:13:53.520 --> 1:13:55.800
Well, we were probationers together.

1:13:56.760 --> 1:13:58.000
At Cable Street.

1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:00.440
The Dirty Squad
falls under my eye these days.

1:14:00.440 --> 1:14:03.520
What's your interest?
A murder with a link to blue films

1:14:03.520 --> 1:14:07.440
sold by a firm called
The Ostrich Fanciers' Club.

1:14:08.920 --> 1:14:10.680
How it is, Fred.

1:14:11.880 --> 1:14:14.800
We've got it just how the upstairs
like it.

1:14:14.800 --> 1:14:16.640
Nice and quiet, no trouble.

1:14:16.640 --> 1:14:18.320
Sure.

1:14:18.320 --> 1:14:20.920
DI Nesbitt and DS Sneed
will put the word out.

1:14:20.920 --> 1:14:24.280
If it's some interloper,
you can have them.

1:14:24.280 --> 1:14:25.520
If not...?

1:14:25.520 --> 1:14:28.000
Tell them they're looking
for a shitehawk

1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:30.920
in a trilby with an orange
feather. About your size.

1:14:32.560 --> 1:14:34.320
When did you blackmail Mahoney?

1:14:34.320 --> 1:14:36.320
When he was prison chaplain
at Wandsworth?

1:14:36.320 --> 1:14:38.080
What do you have on him?
Boys, was it?

1:14:38.080 --> 1:14:39.680
The flesh is weak.

1:14:39.680 --> 1:14:41.440
So, you put the squeeze on,

1:14:41.440 --> 1:14:44.560
he fronts up your racket
beyond the Smoke.

1:14:45.920 --> 1:14:50.240
From time to time, you drop by,
posing as his half-brother Donal,

1:14:50.240 --> 1:14:52.600
to keep an eye on proceedings.

1:14:52.600 --> 1:14:53.960
Is there a real Donal?

1:14:53.960 --> 1:14:56.560
Or was that just for someone
who might ask questions?

1:14:56.560 --> 1:14:58.640
Like his housekeeper, for instance.

1:14:58.640 --> 1:15:01.000
I could hardly show her my warrant
card, could I?

1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:02.920
What happened, Len?

1:15:02.920 --> 1:15:05.240
You were a good thief-taker once.

1:15:05.240 --> 1:15:08.360
We're none of us as clean
as we'd like the world to think, eh?

1:15:11.240 --> 1:15:12.520
Well...

1:15:13.920 --> 1:15:16.800
..the priest is dead now,
whoever did for him.

1:15:17.960 --> 1:15:20.880
The way I read it,
I've got three men dead...

1:15:21.840 --> 1:15:24.600
..all connected
to your little caper.

1:15:24.600 --> 1:15:27.560
Maybe someone's decided
to put you out of business.

1:15:27.560 --> 1:15:29.160
I'll be seeing you.

1:15:29.160 --> 1:15:30.880
Fred...

1:15:33.320 --> 1:15:34.960
Your card's marked.

1:15:34.960 --> 1:15:36.600
For old times.

1:15:38.160 --> 1:15:39.640
Don't come back.

1:15:39.640 --> 1:15:42.280
What you do in your sewer
is your concern.

1:15:43.400 --> 1:15:46.040
You can be king of the shit heap
for all it means to me.

1:15:46.040 --> 1:15:48.640
But you set foot on my ground
again...

1:15:49.680 --> 1:15:51.160
..you'll all swing.

1:15:52.160 --> 1:15:54.600
I don't care whose coat
you're carrying.

1:16:03.200 --> 1:16:04.640
HE SIGHS

1:16:58.720 --> 1:17:00.760
KNOCK ON THE DOOR

1:17:00.760 --> 1:17:02.560
Ah, Morse.
Sir.

1:17:02.560 --> 1:17:05.120
Developments?
Some, sir.

1:17:05.120 --> 1:17:06.760
I think we can rule out the
passenger

1:17:06.760 --> 1:17:08.400
that Lunn picked up at the station.

1:17:08.400 --> 1:17:10.680
How so?
Oh, may I offer you...?

1:17:12.040 --> 1:17:14.760
Yes, sir. Whisky, if I may.

1:17:16.520 --> 1:17:19.720
What's this?
What?

1:17:19.720 --> 1:17:22.600
Oh, well, it's just a...
Just a hobby.

1:17:25.240 --> 1:17:28.000
These are very good, sir.
Oh, thank you.

1:17:28.000 --> 1:17:30.240
Clearing out my wife's clothes,

1:17:30.240 --> 1:17:32.800
I found my old watercolour box
at the back of the wardrobe.

1:17:32.800 --> 1:17:34.080
You were saying?

1:17:36.160 --> 1:17:38.720
Oh, yes, she appears to have been
his mistress.

1:17:38.720 --> 1:17:42.360
He dropped her at home at 9:20
to a beating from her husband.

1:17:45.560 --> 1:17:47.240
Who is she?

1:17:48.440 --> 1:17:50.040
Oh, yes, Miss Parry.

1:17:50.040 --> 1:17:51.640
Life model at the art school.

1:17:51.640 --> 1:17:53.840
Yes, she's quite striking,
isn't she?

1:17:53.840 --> 1:17:55.200
Cheers.

1:18:49.480 --> 1:18:51.240
Miss Parry?

1:18:51.240 --> 1:18:52.640
Yes.

1:18:55.040 --> 1:18:57.080
MORSE:
And what time would that have been?

1:18:57.080 --> 1:18:59.720
Oh, I finished about nine o'clock.

1:18:59.720 --> 1:19:01.360
Ah, good morning, sir.

1:19:01.360 --> 1:19:05.520
Sir, do you remember Mr Roberts,
the dispatcher from Speedy Cabs?

1:19:05.520 --> 1:19:07.040
He's very kindly offered to come in

1:19:07.040 --> 1:19:09.040
and help us out with a statement
this morning.

1:19:09.040 --> 1:19:12.440
A statement? Just a small matter
concerning timings.

1:19:12.440 --> 1:19:15.560
Mr Roberts,
can you tell us what time

1:19:15.560 --> 1:19:20.040
did you give Joe North the job to
pick up Mrs Maynard from her house?

1:19:20.040 --> 1:19:22.160
Mid-afternoon.
3:30, four o'clock.

1:19:22.160 --> 1:19:24.600
Right. And was that over the
telephone or...?

1:19:24.600 --> 1:19:25.840
No, he popped into the office.

1:19:25.840 --> 1:19:29.880
Most of the fellas do around that
time, you know, if they're slack.

1:19:29.880 --> 1:19:32.240
And Speedy Cabs,
they sponsor a table

1:19:32.240 --> 1:19:34.520
at Commodore Maynard's
lodge charity nights.

1:19:34.520 --> 1:19:36.240
Is that right?
Oh, yes.

1:19:37.360 --> 1:19:40.000
Now, would Joe North
have ever gone to those events?

1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:42.640
Oh, we've all been to one or two
of those.

1:19:42.640 --> 1:19:44.040
Joe included.

1:19:45.840 --> 1:19:48.840
You don't think he's involved,
do you? Not Joe!

1:19:48.840 --> 1:19:51.120
Why, I can't believe it.

1:19:51.120 --> 1:19:53.840
Sir, do you remember that we found
Commodore Maynard's body

1:19:53.840 --> 1:19:55.480
in front of the grandfather clock?

1:19:55.480 --> 1:19:57.640
The key was on the floor next to
him.

1:19:57.640 --> 1:20:00.360
The glass door was open
so he could wind it. Exactly.

1:20:00.360 --> 1:20:03.200
His wife told us
he always wound the clocks at 9:00.

1:20:03.200 --> 1:20:04.600
Right.
So, we've been lucky,

1:20:04.600 --> 1:20:06.520
insofar as we've been able to
establish

1:20:06.520 --> 1:20:08.640
at what time each of the
murders took place.

1:20:08.640 --> 1:20:09.680
GUNSHOT

1:20:10.760 --> 1:20:12.640
MORSE:
Dudley Lunn just before 10:00.

1:20:13.800 --> 1:20:15.040
Father Mahoney at 8:00.

1:20:16.360 --> 1:20:18.280
And Commodore Maynard at 9:00.

1:20:18.280 --> 1:20:19.640
Which tells us...

1:20:19.640 --> 1:20:22.840
..that the killer changed the time
on a watch or clock

1:20:22.840 --> 1:20:24.640
at each of the scene of crimes.

1:20:24.640 --> 1:20:26.920
So, at ten o'clock,

1:20:26.920 --> 1:20:30.560
he changed Dudley Lunn's watch
to 6:50.

1:20:30.560 --> 1:20:34.320
At eight o'clock, he changed Father
Mahoney's pocket watch to 3:50.

1:20:34.320 --> 1:20:36.360
And at nine o'clock,

1:20:36.360 --> 1:20:39.960
he changed Commodore Maynard's
carriage clock to 3:10.

1:20:39.960 --> 1:20:42.520
Now, we thought that he was trying
to just supply himself

1:20:42.520 --> 1:20:45.840
with a false alibi. But it's
actually far, far simpler than that.

1:20:45.840 --> 1:20:47.360
If you say so.

1:20:47.360 --> 1:20:49.560
The actual time is immaterial.

1:20:50.760 --> 1:20:54.160
It's the position of the hands on
the clock that's important.

1:20:55.240 --> 1:20:58.000
To use the terminology
that was drilled into us in Signals.

1:20:58.000 --> 1:21:00.800
6:50, left hand down,
right hand high.

1:21:00.800 --> 1:21:03.720
3:50, left hand out, right hand
high.

1:21:03.720 --> 1:21:06.840
3:10, left hand out,
right hand across high.

1:21:06.840 --> 1:21:08.480
Semaphore?
Exactly.

1:21:08.480 --> 1:21:10.840
Mine's a bit rusty, but C-Y-W?

1:21:10.840 --> 1:21:12.200
C-Y-W, yes.

1:21:12.200 --> 1:21:13.520
C-Y-W?

1:21:13.520 --> 1:21:15.080
It doesn't mean anything.

1:21:15.080 --> 1:21:17.520
No, well, it's a puzzle, isn't it?

1:21:18.480 --> 1:21:20.080
Ah, Miss Parry.

1:21:26.080 --> 1:21:28.360
Fy nghyw bach!

1:21:31.480 --> 1:21:32.760
Oh...!

1:21:40.240 --> 1:21:41.520
Cyw...

1:21:43.280 --> 1:21:45.040
Thank you, Miss Parry, for coming in

1:21:45.040 --> 1:21:47.200
to confirm what you confided in me
earlier.

1:21:47.200 --> 1:21:49.760
Constable, if you can escort her
to the canteen,

1:21:49.760 --> 1:21:51.000
I'll see you in a moment.

1:21:52.800 --> 1:21:55.640
Yes, of course, sir, you're right.
C-Y-W doesn't mean anything.

1:21:55.640 --> 1:21:57.160
In English.

1:21:57.160 --> 1:21:58.400
But in Welsh...

1:21:59.360 --> 1:22:02.840
..and perhaps you can help me
with my pronunciation here,

1:22:02.840 --> 1:22:05.440
cyw is a term of endearment.

1:22:06.480 --> 1:22:08.200
It means "chick".

1:22:08.200 --> 1:22:10.000
Now, you said to us...

1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:11.520
.."This is Siwan.

1:22:12.520 --> 1:22:14.720
"Joan, she'd be in English.

1:22:15.680 --> 1:22:18.240
"But most people call her Birdie."
Yes?

1:22:18.240 --> 1:22:20.200
So she was to everyone else.

1:22:21.200 --> 1:22:22.560
But to me...

1:22:23.520 --> 1:22:24.640
..fy nghyw bach.

1:22:25.960 --> 1:22:27.360
My little chick.

1:22:28.680 --> 1:22:29.760
Cyw.

1:22:29.760 --> 1:22:31.080
MORSE: I recognised her

1:22:31.080 --> 1:22:33.760
from Superintendent Bright's
sketchpad, sir.

1:22:33.760 --> 1:22:35.920
Although she now calls herself
Lynn Parry,

1:22:35.920 --> 1:22:37.560
after her mother's maiden name.

1:22:40.800 --> 1:22:43.960
She's also the blonde in the blue
films made with Dudley Lunn.

1:22:49.120 --> 1:22:52.960
Ifan Roberts, I'm arresting you
for the murder of Dudley Lunn,

1:22:52.960 --> 1:22:55.040
Father Mahoney
and Commodore Maynard.

1:22:57.720 --> 1:23:00.760
Presumably you watched Lunn
for a long time.

1:23:02.280 --> 1:23:04.200
Planning, waiting for your moment.

1:23:06.640 --> 1:23:08.600
You knew he was knocking off
Patty Grady.

1:23:09.520 --> 1:23:13.240
And you knew that Mr Grady
worked at Paradise Court.

1:23:15.520 --> 1:23:17.720
I watched them all for a month,
on and off.

1:23:19.960 --> 1:23:21.760
Nobody notices taxis.

1:23:23.080 --> 1:23:25.840
Get behind the wheel of a cab
and you might as well be invisible.

1:23:26.960 --> 1:23:28.640
But we see everything.

1:23:31.280 --> 1:23:32.960
The pathetic secrets.

1:23:32.960 --> 1:23:34.680
The carrying on.

1:23:35.760 --> 1:23:37.040
All of it.

1:23:38.480 --> 1:23:41.960
THURSDAY: As a dispatcher, you were
perfectly placed

1:23:41.960 --> 1:23:45.200
to send Lunn on a non-existent job
to Hovelle Wood,

1:23:45.200 --> 1:23:47.880
where you would be waiting for him.

1:23:47.880 --> 1:23:50.960
Ifan, what's...?
HE GASPS

1:23:50.960 --> 1:23:52.600
What's this about?

1:23:56.320 --> 1:23:59.640
See what you did, Dudley,
to my Siwan!

1:23:59.640 --> 1:24:02.280
Eh? Tell me who else is involved!
No-one.

1:24:02.280 --> 1:24:03.520
Tell me!

1:24:03.520 --> 1:24:07.840
THURSDAY: You probably told him he'd
live if he gave you what you wanted.

1:24:08.800 --> 1:24:09.840
GUNSHOT

1:24:16.840 --> 1:24:20.160
How did you discover
your daughter was involved?

1:24:23.840 --> 1:24:25.120
Oh...

1:24:25.120 --> 1:24:27.800
I see. Of course.

1:24:29.880 --> 1:24:33.280
You'd become a member of
The Ostrich Fanciers' Club.

1:24:35.120 --> 1:24:37.680
You'd ordered some of their films.

1:24:37.680 --> 1:24:40.000
You saw her.

1:24:44.440 --> 1:24:45.920
I knew her at once.

1:24:47.280 --> 1:24:49.200
TEARFULLY: She was my little girl.

1:24:50.840 --> 1:24:52.560
Fy nghyw bach!

1:24:59.840 --> 1:25:01.680
HE EXHALES HEAVILY

1:25:01.680 --> 1:25:04.080
He was just a name on a card
twice a year.

1:25:04.080 --> 1:25:05.560
"Love, Dad."

1:25:07.200 --> 1:25:09.480
Dad? What does that even mean?

1:25:09.480 --> 1:25:11.360
I barely remember him.

1:25:11.360 --> 1:25:13.720
Perhaps. But he never forgot you.

1:25:13.720 --> 1:25:16.240
Well, maybe it would have been
better for everyone if he had.

1:25:17.240 --> 1:25:20.680
Something far easier said than done
for any father.

1:25:21.720 --> 1:25:22.960
What can you think of me?

1:25:24.120 --> 1:25:27.040
I think you're an intelligent,
sensitive, young woman

1:25:27.040 --> 1:25:29.000
who fell amongst scoundrels.

1:25:30.200 --> 1:25:32.560
Any shame is on their side.

1:25:34.160 --> 1:25:35.680
Not yours.

1:25:44.560 --> 1:25:45.760
Thank you.

1:25:57.560 --> 1:25:59.920
DISTANT BELL TOLLS

1:26:05.480 --> 1:26:08.000
45, 45, pick up

1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:11.320
98B Chestnut Way, New Hinkley.

1:26:12.600 --> 1:26:13.760
Going to...

1:26:13.760 --> 1:26:16.120
..North Oxford Lawn Tennis Club.

1:26:16.120 --> 1:26:18.440
Passenger's a Miss Carlitt.

1:26:19.720 --> 1:26:22.280
Yeah, Roger, Clarry. On way.

1:26:22.280 --> 1:26:23.760
TAXI ENGINE STARTS

1:26:53.920 --> 1:26:55.480
I should've tumbled.

1:26:55.480 --> 1:26:57.280
Crossed flags on his arm.

1:26:57.280 --> 1:26:59.320
It's the badge of a Naval signalman.

1:26:59.320 --> 1:27:01.680
And what of the graffiti?

1:27:01.680 --> 1:27:04.320
Micah.5.15.

1:27:04.320 --> 1:27:09.000
"And I will execute vengeance
with anger and fury upon the heathen

1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:10.840
"such as they have not heard."

1:27:10.840 --> 1:27:13.200
He did it in her name.
I can't say I blame him.

1:27:13.200 --> 1:27:15.680
If it had been my daughter...
Ah, but it never would be.

1:27:15.680 --> 1:27:17.560
It could happen to anyone.

1:27:17.560 --> 1:27:19.160
Given the right circumstances.

1:27:19.160 --> 1:27:20.920
They're all somebody's daughter.

1:27:20.920 --> 1:27:22.840
Somebody's mother, sister.

1:27:22.840 --> 1:27:24.960
They all mean something to someone.

1:27:26.120 --> 1:27:27.480
Or did once.

1:27:28.640 --> 1:27:30.600
And now because of
The Ostrich Fanciers' Club,

1:27:30.600 --> 1:27:31.840
they mean nothing to anyone.

1:27:33.080 --> 1:27:34.160
Except to us.

1:27:35.600 --> 1:27:37.400
They mean something to us.

1:27:39.480 --> 1:27:40.800
To me, at least.

1:27:42.680 --> 1:27:45.280
I'd have said to you, too, once.

1:27:45.280 --> 1:27:47.040
Well, I'm not the fool I was.

1:27:49.840 --> 1:27:51.480
I quite liked that fool.

1:27:52.920 --> 1:27:54.560
He hoped for the best in people.

1:27:56.160 --> 1:27:59.960
Surely, it's better
to see things as they are.

1:28:02.400 --> 1:28:05.760
People make bad choices,
they have to pay the consequences.

1:28:05.760 --> 1:28:07.000
What about pity, understanding?

1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:08.840
Where does that fit into the
picture?

1:28:08.840 --> 1:28:10.920
I'm not here to...

1:28:10.920 --> 1:28:12.400
..kiss the wounded.

1:28:13.520 --> 1:28:15.360
I'm here to make sure justice
gets done.

1:28:16.800 --> 1:28:18.880
The rest I can leave to the likes of
Father Mahoney,

1:28:18.880 --> 1:28:20.000
for all the good it did him.

1:28:21.160 --> 1:28:22.560
Well...

1:28:24.280 --> 1:28:25.920
..I'm sure you know best.

1:28:31.560 --> 1:28:33.640
Another beer?
Or are you bitter enough?

1:28:33.640 --> 1:28:35.000
MORSE CHUCKLES

1:28:35.000 --> 1:28:37.320
No, I won't.
I've got something on tonight.

1:28:39.400 --> 1:28:41.040
We're who we are, Morse.

1:28:42.520 --> 1:28:44.480
Our nature...

1:28:45.840 --> 1:28:48.000
..we can try to escape it.

1:28:49.080 --> 1:28:50.880
But it'll find us out in the end.

1:28:52.640 --> 1:28:54.400
A man's what he is.

1:28:54.400 --> 1:28:56.120
Whether he likes it or not.

1:29:42.520 --> 1:29:44.360
