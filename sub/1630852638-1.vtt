WEBVTT

02:21.141 --> 02:23.404
It is not our responsibility

02:23.404 --> 02:27.190
to give the devil
a chance to repent.

02:27.190 --> 02:30.106
He must perish with her.

02:30.106 --> 02:32.021
-Fear is guiding your words.

02:32.021 --> 02:34.937
-God guides my words,

02:34.937 --> 02:36.678
and Lucifer
will be guiding hers.

02:36.678 --> 02:38.636
-We must listen to them
nevertheless.

02:42.379 --> 02:45.165
She is no devil.

02:45.165 --> 02:47.776
-Doubt clouds your mind,
my friend.

02:50.082 --> 02:53.608
-Her eyes...

02:53.608 --> 02:56.611
Cannot but think about them.

02:56.611 --> 02:58.874
-We must turn
to the Lord's Prayer.

03:19.373 --> 03:23.812
-Today is the 3rd of December,
the year 1843.

03:25.988 --> 03:31.254
We proceed in the interrogation
of Maiden Mary,

03:31.254 --> 03:36.999
in regards to the tragic events
that have occurred at the farm

03:36.999 --> 03:40.916
following her grandmother's
sudden departure.

03:40.916 --> 03:42.265
Do you understand the charges

03:42.265 --> 03:45.442
that have been
proffered against you?

03:45.442 --> 03:47.139
-Yes.

03:56.540 --> 03:58.629
-Could you recite
the Lord's Prayer for us?

04:07.072 --> 04:13.775
-Our father, which art
in heaven, hallowed be thy name.

04:13.775 --> 04:17.387
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done,

04:17.387 --> 04:19.259
in earth as it is in heaven.

04:21.435 --> 04:26.048
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses,

04:26.048 --> 04:28.920
as we forgive them
that trespass against us,

04:31.445 --> 04:36.798
and lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

04:47.722 --> 04:52.944
For thine is the kingdom and
the power and the glory forever.

05:38.338 --> 05:42.080
-What's a man of the law to do,

05:42.080 --> 05:45.170
when he finds himself
at a crossroad?

05:48.652 --> 05:53.962
Perform his duty,

05:53.962 --> 05:58.270
or lend an ear to curiosity?

06:01.578 --> 06:04.538
-Which path appeases you
the most, Constable?

06:44.969 --> 06:48.973
-Speak freely.

06:50.932 --> 06:52.237
-It's Mary.

06:54.762 --> 07:00.245
Our daughter's ears are deaf
to the Lord's preachings.

07:00.245 --> 07:10.255
She continues to engage
in acts with the housemaid.

07:10.255 --> 07:12.910
-They look at one another.

07:12.910 --> 07:15.913
They long for
one another's touch,

07:15.913 --> 07:18.786
and they do so
in bright sunlight,

07:18.786 --> 07:21.353
trying to make rule of it.

07:21.353 --> 07:22.659
-All she does is deny it.

07:22.659 --> 07:26.358
There's no reasoning with her.

07:26.358 --> 07:30.145
-The Lord does not excuse
such abominable behaviors.

07:30.145 --> 07:31.799
-Rightfully so.

07:31.799 --> 07:37.413
-Randolph and I ask
for your intervention, Mother,

07:37.413 --> 07:40.764
to teach the maid
and Mary a lesson.

07:44.899 --> 07:47.902
-Have your brother
come to the farm.

08:57.972 --> 09:00.801
-Please, Eustace.

09:00.801 --> 09:03.847
-You do realize
you're asking a lot of me?

09:03.847 --> 09:06.197
-Eleanor is a fine worker.

09:08.460 --> 09:10.201
I would not ask you
to take her word

09:10.201 --> 09:14.858
if not for the distraction
she causes to our daughter.

09:14.858 --> 09:17.208
-Why would we harbor such
a sinful presence

09:17.208 --> 09:18.906
in our household?

09:18.906 --> 09:22.692
-But taking her away
from temptation might heal her.

09:22.692 --> 09:24.999
-She knows how to read.

09:24.999 --> 09:27.218
She can provide good help.

09:32.006 --> 09:36.880
-We seek to eradicate the evil
flower by cutting the stem,

09:36.880 --> 09:38.882
but the roots are too deep.

09:38.882 --> 09:40.580
I'm afraid it would grow again.

09:47.804 --> 09:50.067
Correction is needed
before we move her.

09:56.900 --> 09:58.728
-Knees and prayers.

10:09.478 --> 10:12.481
-Set your affection on things
above,

10:12.481 --> 10:15.397
not on things on the earth,

10:15.397 --> 10:19.923
for you are dead and your life
is hid with Christ and God.

10:24.275 --> 10:29.890
When Christ, who is your life,
appears,

10:29.890 --> 10:32.327
then you shall also appear
with him and God.

10:36.723 --> 10:38.463
-You.

10:40.727 --> 10:47.124
Continue now.

10:47.124 --> 10:51.520
-I can't.

10:51.520 --> 10:56.481
I c-can't.
I-I do not know the verses.

10:56.481 --> 11:00.094
-Go ahead, Mary.

11:00.094 --> 11:01.965
-It --
It hurts too much.

11:09.233 --> 11:11.714
-Mortify --

11:11.714 --> 11:16.719
Mortify...
therefore...your members

11:16.719 --> 11:19.504
which are upon the earth --

11:19.504 --> 11:26.598
fornication, uncleanness,
inordinate affection,

11:26.598 --> 11:28.165
evil concupiscence,

11:31.299 --> 11:37.305
and covetousness,
which is idolatry.

12:05.159 --> 12:07.248
-It is time to rest now.

12:11.513 --> 12:13.384
-Ah, ah.

12:17.824 --> 12:21.392
We all convey that our
poorly-instructed friend

12:21.392 --> 12:26.876
should spend the night thinking
of the next words to say.

12:29.226 --> 12:31.402
Do we not?
-Yes.

12:31.402 --> 12:33.230
-You speak well, Mother.

12:36.320 --> 12:37.931
-Mary.

12:41.195 --> 12:42.762
-Ye--Yes.

13:00.431 --> 13:03.565
-Will you satisfy an inquiry
of mine, Constable?

13:06.437 --> 13:09.484
Will you share the words your
deputy whispered in your ear

13:09.484 --> 13:11.094
before he left the room?

13:13.880 --> 13:17.144
-For this purpose, the son
of God was manifested,

13:17.144 --> 13:19.407
that he might destroy
the works of the devil.

13:21.757 --> 13:23.846
-Lucifer was an angel
before we cast the name

13:23.846 --> 13:26.588
of the devil upon him.

13:26.588 --> 13:28.155
-What's that to say?

13:30.592 --> 13:34.161
-That God creates enemies
in order to perform his good.

13:46.913 --> 13:49.350
-Does your mind carry troubles?

13:51.874 --> 13:57.227
-I saw Eleanor and Sister Mary
being punished last night.

13:57.227 --> 13:58.838
What was the cause of it?

14:05.714 --> 14:08.021
-Do you ever wonder
what keeps the guard around?

14:11.154 --> 14:13.069
He attempted to escape once.

14:15.158 --> 14:18.161
He ran away in the middle
of the day

14:18.161 --> 14:21.295
toward the other side
of the river,

14:21.295 --> 14:26.691
where Father Eustace,
Mother Ann, and I live.

14:26.691 --> 14:30.870
My father caught him and made
sure he would never run again.

14:30.870 --> 14:34.351
-No! No!

14:34.351 --> 14:37.180
-After that, he forced him
to kneel on rice

14:37.180 --> 14:38.878
every night for one week.

14:41.881 --> 14:45.188
Cousin Mary and the maid
play a dangerous game

14:45.188 --> 14:47.843
and were punished accordingly.

14:52.369 --> 14:54.545
-I can't spend my days
without you.

14:58.071 --> 15:00.160
-It's a risk.
We can't be seen together.

15:02.466 --> 15:04.251
-Let a few days pass.

15:08.385 --> 15:10.213
-But they'll take...

15:10.213 --> 15:11.780
away from me.

15:21.311 --> 15:25.272
-I won't let them, my dear.

15:25.272 --> 15:28.144
I won't.

15:30.538 --> 15:31.887
-Ah!

15:35.760 --> 15:38.024
-You should go.
You should go.

15:52.516 --> 15:55.345
-What have I done
to deserve such fare?

16:07.096 --> 16:10.578
Food sharpens the senses.

16:10.578 --> 16:14.712
They say lack of it
makes mine sharper.

16:17.715 --> 16:21.284
That's the price they pay
for exceptional service.

16:26.637 --> 16:31.816
Fear and weakness keep us
here...

16:39.433 --> 16:41.000
not devotion.

16:45.656 --> 16:49.269
Feed it to the chickens,
if you wish.

18:19.576 --> 18:21.448
-We cannot trust him.

18:21.448 --> 18:23.014
-I think it could work.

18:23.014 --> 18:25.626
-But he answers to my family.

18:25.626 --> 18:28.933
-Let me speak with him.

18:28.933 --> 18:30.457
He is our only option.

18:46.516 --> 18:48.127
-Matthew.

18:50.868 --> 18:53.219
It's past bedtime.

18:53.219 --> 18:55.395
Why do you linger?

18:55.395 --> 18:58.311
-Did they ever let you wander
through the woods?

19:00.704 --> 19:02.445
Do you know what it looks like?

19:05.927 --> 19:07.537
-I never saw it.

19:13.064 --> 19:15.154
-Ah!

19:16.024 --> 19:18.113
-What bothers your foot?

19:18.113 --> 19:20.550
-Nothing.

19:33.433 --> 19:34.869
-You have a bad splinter.

19:37.132 --> 19:38.742
Don't move.

19:44.661 --> 19:46.272
Do you trust me?

20:15.823 --> 20:17.781
-You're not to leave the house
this late of an hour.

20:17.781 --> 20:19.348
-Make a deal with me.

20:22.699 --> 20:25.224
Allow us to hide in the coop
at night,

20:25.224 --> 20:27.574
and make no mention of it.

20:27.574 --> 20:29.315
I will feed you bread in return.

22:24.299 --> 22:26.954
-This kitchen has never been
so indulgent

22:26.954 --> 22:28.695
with the people it feeds.

22:31.524 --> 22:34.265
-I thought our guests had been
finding the food pleasant.

22:51.326 --> 22:54.198
-Perhaps --

22:54.198 --> 22:56.462
Perhaps another correction
is needed.

23:03.904 --> 23:07.864
-When Christ, who is your life,
shall appear, then --

23:07.864 --> 23:10.345
then you shall also appear
with him in glory.

23:14.523 --> 23:19.572
-Pleasantry is a dangerous road.

23:19.572 --> 23:21.748
You ought not celebrate
the ordinary days

23:21.748 --> 23:23.358
more than the holy ones.

23:26.709 --> 23:30.321
-My knees will break.

23:30.321 --> 23:32.367
-So be it.

24:04.660 --> 24:06.401
-I can't stand
another correction.

24:06.401 --> 24:08.751
-Then stand losing
your night walks.

24:13.800 --> 24:17.499
Enjoy the day,
while it is bright out.

24:20.197 --> 24:22.461
-I'll make more bread
next week.

24:35.386 --> 24:36.997
Please listen to reason.

24:36.997 --> 24:38.607
-Let us end this.

24:41.131 --> 24:43.264
Does the poison lack potency?

24:47.094 --> 24:49.226
Or does my hand lack courage?

24:54.797 --> 24:56.364
Make one more loaf.

24:58.497 --> 25:00.107
I'll instruct you.

25:09.072 --> 25:13.555
-Together in thy name,
thou will be around us.

25:14.687 --> 25:20.823
Fulfill now, O Lord, the desires
and petition of us servants,

25:20.823 --> 25:24.871
as may be most expedient
for them,

25:24.871 --> 25:30.180
granting us, in this world,
knowledge of thy truth,

25:30.180 --> 25:35.185
and in the worlds to come,
life everlasting.

25:35.185 --> 25:37.710
Amen.

25:37.710 --> 25:41.931
-Grace to our Lord,
Jesus Christ.

25:41.931 --> 25:48.198
The love of God and the
fellowship of the Holy Ghost

25:48.198 --> 25:54.074
be with you all evermore.

25:54.074 --> 25:57.164
-Amen.
-Amen.

25:57.164 --> 26:02.169
-She's learning, is she not?
-Mm.

26:02.169 --> 26:04.867
Mary?

26:04.867 --> 26:06.477
-Eleanor.

26:10.569 --> 26:15.138
She held the book of prayer
at the vesper.

26:19.752 --> 26:22.581
Do you think the corrections
are necessary?

26:24.974 --> 26:29.457
-You speak against
our course of action?

26:29.457 --> 26:34.418
-She recited the prayers
without fallacy.

26:34.418 --> 26:36.029
-So?

26:38.466 --> 26:40.990
-I fear the consequences,
Agnes.

26:43.558 --> 26:46.561
-What sort of consequences?

26:51.914 --> 26:53.481
What is the matter?

26:57.267 --> 26:59.095
-I cannot speak on this
with knowledge.

26:59.095 --> 27:00.706
I have but a percept.

27:20.203 --> 27:22.466
-Our fate rests on this.

27:25.469 --> 27:29.430
Test it, then come back
to the house.

27:31.519 --> 27:33.782
Do not indulge.

28:02.158 --> 28:05.814
-Wait.

28:05.814 --> 28:09.949
What happens when they see it?

28:09.949 --> 28:11.777
-We'll say the rats did it.

28:16.172 --> 28:18.784
-Stop.
-Mary!

28:18.784 --> 28:22.701
-Let's run away tonight
and avoid us all troubles.

28:27.706 --> 28:30.839
Uncle Eustace spends
his nights in the house.

28:30.839 --> 28:33.146
No one watches the other end
of the field.

28:44.897 --> 28:47.290
-What about Theodore?

28:47.290 --> 28:49.423
-Wh-- He will not see us
in the dark,

28:49.423 --> 28:50.729
and his legs
aren't strong enough to run --

28:50.729 --> 28:52.165
-He deserves to leave, too.

28:54.515 --> 28:57.213
-This is for us
and for us only.

29:01.087 --> 29:04.830
-I'm tired.

29:04.830 --> 29:06.266
-Me, too.

29:08.442 --> 29:10.574
-I'm tired of a life
spent hiding.

29:13.839 --> 29:18.060
They will not cease to
torment us until they find us.

29:18.060 --> 29:20.062
That is not a life I long for.

29:26.329 --> 29:27.896
I'm not afraid.

31:51.822 --> 31:54.521
-Yes?

31:54.521 --> 31:56.088
-Matthew's left the house.

32:36.258 --> 32:39.827
-"The Temple
of Earthly Desires".

32:39.827 --> 32:43.744
"Long ago, a starving peasant
stumbled upon a desolate temple

32:43.744 --> 32:47.313
on his way
to the town of Ephesus.

32:47.313 --> 32:51.143
He stepped inside to offer
his prayers by the altar,

32:51.143 --> 32:53.667
when his god spoke to him.

32:53.667 --> 32:57.279
He summoned him to guard
his temple day and night,

32:57.279 --> 32:58.977
for only this way,

32:58.977 --> 33:03.111
he could earn his place
in the new heavenly kingdom.

33:03.111 --> 33:05.984
Great provisions hid inside
the temple,

33:05.984 --> 33:08.682
of which the peasant
was instructed to eat none.

33:12.425 --> 33:15.645
Yet one night,
slave to his hunger,

33:15.645 --> 33:19.345
entrusting darkness to deceive
his god's attention,

33:19.345 --> 33:22.609
he came into the temple
and stole a loaf of bread,

33:22.609 --> 33:26.004
making a ravenous meal of it.

33:26.004 --> 33:30.921
The god, whose ever-watching eye
allowed no sin to go unnoticed,

33:30.921 --> 33:35.100
unleashed all his anger,
slaying the peasant,

33:35.100 --> 33:37.537
and proclaiming
that from that day on,

33:37.537 --> 33:40.844
whoever attempted to ever
satisfy his appetite

33:40.844 --> 33:42.498
would meet great punishment."

33:44.805 --> 33:47.155
-Read on.

33:47.155 --> 33:48.809
I like the sound of your voice.

33:56.034 --> 33:59.559
-I'm afraid of what I might
learn if I indulge my curiosity.

34:10.438 --> 34:12.527
Who is the Old Lady
of Bethabara?

35:00.272 --> 35:03.101
-"The Old Lady of Bethabara".

35:03.101 --> 35:05.059
"There was a time --"

35:09.237 --> 35:12.980
-Go back to the house.
Now.

35:15.765 --> 35:17.419
You must not speak of this.

35:27.081 --> 35:29.170
-Eleanor?

35:34.262 --> 35:36.221
Eleanor?

35:37.918 --> 35:39.572
-Mary?

36:43.940 --> 36:50.295
-Mortify therefore your members
which are upon the earth --

36:50.295 --> 36:56.126
fornication, uncleanliness,
inordinate affection,

36:56.126 --> 36:58.041
evil concupiscence,

36:58.041 --> 37:01.567
and covetousness,
which is idolatry.

37:08.704 --> 37:11.403
-You'll part this house soon.

39:15.962 --> 39:18.356
-I am sorry.

39:21.968 --> 39:24.492
I paid the price
of my curiosity.

39:28.670 --> 39:31.978
-Curiosity put a splinter
in your foot, did it not?

39:35.721 --> 39:37.636
You've been telling
Mother and Father.

39:37.636 --> 39:39.464
-I have not.
-You are the cause of this.

39:39.464 --> 39:41.074
-I am not.
-Stop it.

39:43.685 --> 39:45.557
Believe me.

39:45.557 --> 39:47.820
You pay no price.

40:00.441 --> 40:02.704
-Is the maid going to be moved?

40:06.273 --> 40:08.449
-One proper correction.

40:08.449 --> 40:10.059
Yes.

40:24.204 --> 40:27.163
What troubles you?

40:27.163 --> 40:36.956
-Something I dare not say,
but I can't hold any longer.

40:36.956 --> 40:40.481
-Then don't hold.

40:41.264 --> 40:44.354
-I...

40:44.354 --> 40:46.444
once had an old book.

40:48.924 --> 40:55.670
That book speaks of...

40:55.670 --> 41:01.981
things I never believed
to be true.

41:05.288 --> 41:09.641
Events that could bring death
upon this family.

41:11.991 --> 41:19.215
I brought that book into this
house, and someone took it.

41:24.917 --> 41:28.660
-What do you ask of me?

41:28.660 --> 41:30.662
-Don't linger.

41:30.662 --> 41:33.491
Move the maid now, today.

41:37.625 --> 41:41.673
Sinful affection must remain
the only evil...

41:43.805 --> 41:47.200
...that I inspired
my daughter to pursue.

43:34.394 --> 43:35.961
-Tell me about the funeral.

43:38.441 --> 43:41.662
-In our family, the relatives
of the dead

43:41.662 --> 43:44.143
make a vow of silence
for the entire day.

44:21.441 --> 44:23.312
-Go now. Go.

46:04.065 --> 46:05.806
-Are you a member
of the family?

46:09.244 --> 46:10.855
-I am here for business.

46:12.944 --> 46:17.513
-Today is a day of mourning,
not for business.

46:19.733 --> 46:21.779
-I only bring
what I was called for.

46:29.699 --> 46:31.310
May I lower my hands?

46:38.839 --> 46:40.449
What happened to your chickens?

46:43.583 --> 46:46.716
-The rats infested the coop.

46:49.632 --> 46:51.852
Walk up to the house,

46:51.852 --> 46:54.463
circle around to the left side.

46:54.463 --> 46:56.683
There, you'll see a door.

46:56.683 --> 47:00.905
The maid will open it to you.

47:00.905 --> 47:04.299
Her name is Eleanor.

47:04.299 --> 47:06.780
She can't talk.

47:06.780 --> 47:08.695
-I was informed of the rule.

47:08.695 --> 47:10.436
-No.

47:10.436 --> 47:14.266
She cannot talk.

47:25.581 --> 47:28.758
When you see her,
you give her this.

47:33.546 --> 47:37.855
I am no longer allowed
inside the house,

47:37.855 --> 47:40.161
and she needs this
to prepare the meal.

48:28.601 --> 48:30.211
-May I come in?

49:03.288 --> 49:05.116
You can't talk, right?

49:18.216 --> 49:19.869
My deepest condolences.

49:34.928 --> 49:38.236
Sure you don't mind if I help?

49:38.236 --> 49:41.108
This, it looks like
a lot of work.

50:04.479 --> 50:07.091
Mysterious, isn't it?

50:07.091 --> 50:08.657
The human body.

50:12.139 --> 50:13.706
Do you know what they call it?

50:16.839 --> 50:19.103
I gather you don't get
many books around here.

50:20.234 --> 50:22.802
Hmm.

50:27.067 --> 50:31.202
When I was born, my mother
brought me to a doctor.

50:33.552 --> 50:35.467
He looked at my face and said
that it was caused

50:35.467 --> 50:37.686
by an imperfection
in my brain --

50:37.686 --> 50:39.775
that I was going to look
like this forever.

50:53.572 --> 50:56.444
So she brought me
to another doctor,

50:56.444 --> 50:58.577
who told her he could
burn the mark off with --

50:58.577 --> 51:02.189
with a candle.

51:02.189 --> 51:04.409
He said that it would continue
to cause me great trouble

51:04.409 --> 51:07.412
and still look hideous
to the eye,

51:07.412 --> 51:09.718
but that it would ultimately
soften my demeanor.

51:12.243 --> 51:15.507
No.

51:15.507 --> 51:22.601
Then, a few years later,
we saw a third doctor,

51:22.601 --> 51:26.648
who mentioned an old little book
he saw my face on.

51:28.781 --> 51:31.784
He believed that a child
born out of wedlock

51:31.784 --> 51:34.613
would carry a physical mark
of the sin that was committed.

51:39.313 --> 51:41.185
Monstrous birth.

52:03.772 --> 52:07.254
The doctor made her promise
to dispose of me --

52:07.254 --> 52:08.864
said my disappearance
would signify

52:08.864 --> 52:11.345
that a new heavenly kingdom
was coming.

52:14.087 --> 52:18.178
And my mother believed that.

52:21.529 --> 52:24.228
I am very educated
in the art of survival.

52:26.534 --> 52:29.842
I stabbed my mother to death
that very day.

52:29.842 --> 52:31.452
Went back to the doctor,

52:31.452 --> 52:33.628
forced him to devolve
a large sum of money.

52:38.111 --> 52:39.721
He agreed.

52:43.421 --> 52:49.253
See, that is how trade works.

52:49.253 --> 52:50.906
I gave him freedom.

52:50.906 --> 52:52.517
He gave me money.

52:55.302 --> 52:58.914
I gave you my chickens.

52:58.914 --> 53:00.481
You gave me your pouch.

53:10.535 --> 53:17.716
It appears as though I came
with my own small pouch.

53:22.416 --> 53:27.726
And like that stupid doctor
had a desire for life,

53:27.726 --> 53:29.249
the guard outside told me

53:29.249 --> 53:31.686
that you show as great
a desire for this.

53:35.037 --> 53:39.477
Question is,
what can you offer now?

53:58.844 --> 54:00.193
-I know.

54:00.193 --> 54:03.022
-I know my face
is enemy of desire.

54:07.853 --> 54:12.988
But can the mute girl excuse
a sight for some time?

55:22.493 --> 55:24.233
-Eleanor.

55:43.122 --> 55:44.950
Can I take some bread with me?

56:17.722 --> 56:19.376
Which one?

56:25.382 --> 56:27.122
Is this one better?

56:45.489 --> 56:47.099
Oh, yeah.

56:49.275 --> 56:51.364
This one is soft.

57:00.547 --> 57:03.202
Why?!

57:03.202 --> 57:06.074
Why'd you do this?!

57:15.301 --> 57:17.564
Whore! Why did you --

01:09:42.569 --> 01:09:45.703
-This is what silence
did to our family.

01:09:48.053 --> 01:09:51.665
This is the real price
of correction.

01:09:54.886 --> 01:09:57.802
Speak, Father.

01:09:57.802 --> 01:09:59.673
No one is watching.

01:09:59.673 --> 01:10:03.068
Nobody cares!

01:10:03.068 --> 01:10:06.027
Speak! Speak, Father!
Speak!

01:10:38.408 --> 01:10:40.584
-No eyes watch
this household anymore.

01:10:49.897 --> 01:10:51.508
Is it worth a loaf of bread?

01:11:02.127 --> 01:11:03.737
Which one?

01:11:11.658 --> 01:11:13.225
You knew I would come back.

01:11:18.578 --> 01:11:21.059
-You don't have to do this.

01:11:21.059 --> 01:11:22.713
Please go home.

01:11:28.066 --> 01:11:30.634
-Had my face not caused you
enough distress...

01:11:33.506 --> 01:11:35.160
...what would this have done?

01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:36.770
Hmm?

01:11:43.124 --> 01:11:45.039
Mnh-mnh.

01:12:00.359 --> 01:12:03.493
I asked the guard why he would
not wave this pistol

01:12:03.493 --> 01:12:05.321
and demand the fare he deserves.

01:12:11.283 --> 01:12:13.503
He said he only had two bullets.

01:12:16.157 --> 01:12:18.508
-You can stay here.

01:12:18.508 --> 01:12:20.118
We will leave.

01:12:22.990 --> 01:12:25.993
They hide gold in this house.

01:12:25.993 --> 01:12:28.779
There's a lot of it. I --
I will tell you where it is.

01:12:31.782 --> 01:12:33.218
We will leave.

01:12:33.218 --> 01:12:34.828
Isn't that right, Eleanor?

01:12:41.139 --> 01:12:42.749
Eleanor?

01:12:49.190 --> 01:12:50.844
Eleanor?

01:13:31.929 --> 01:13:33.931
Who broke the silence?

01:13:37.064 --> 01:13:40.024
Who called you to bring business
to this house?

01:13:44.332 --> 01:13:46.422
Whose voice did you hear?

01:14:30.466 --> 01:14:34.121
-It is misguided to fight me.

01:14:37.864 --> 01:14:44.654
For our story, we must
draw inspiration

01:14:44.654 --> 01:14:48.527
from the book your father
brought into this house.

01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:17.121
-"There was a time
in Bethabara,

01:15:17.121 --> 01:15:22.256
a small town east of Jericho,
when a noblewoman loved

01:15:22.256 --> 01:15:25.216
one of her female servants
to great distraction."

01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:29.916
-Read on.

01:15:29.916 --> 01:15:33.137
I like the sound of your voice.

01:15:35.879 --> 01:15:40.318
-"One day, the twain wandered
by the west bank

01:15:40.318 --> 01:15:42.755
of the River Jordan.

01:15:42.755 --> 01:15:47.543
They undid their robes
and bathed together.

01:15:47.543 --> 01:15:50.241
Great quiet held
the noontime hour,

01:15:50.241 --> 01:15:54.419
until a passerby, an old lady,
came into the flowing river

01:15:54.419 --> 01:15:58.249
and saw the noblewoman
and her servant.

01:15:58.249 --> 01:16:01.992
Seeing the old lady, they jumped
at her and killed her

01:16:01.992 --> 01:16:05.909
to avoid any mention
of what she saw.

01:16:05.909 --> 01:16:08.912
The following day, they returned
upon the riverbank,

01:16:08.912 --> 01:16:11.218
wretched women,
and found the old lady

01:16:11.218 --> 01:16:14.918
standing alive
by means of divine intervention.

01:16:14.918 --> 01:16:17.094
'My God demanded that this
shall be the land

01:16:17.094 --> 01:16:21.664
upon which I build a house
in his praise,' she said,

01:16:21.664 --> 01:16:23.840
wrought and hard.

01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:25.885
'And whoever desecrates it,

01:16:25.885 --> 01:16:28.540
that a heavy price
shall they behold.'

01:16:30.934 --> 01:16:33.719
The old lady drowned
the servant to death

01:16:33.719 --> 01:16:36.635
and blinded the noblewoman,

01:16:36.635 --> 01:16:41.814
marking her with the third sign
of God's newly desired kingdom."

01:16:44.382 --> 01:16:47.167
-At last we stand,

01:16:47.167 --> 01:16:54.000
serving as examples
of His whole new heaven.

01:18:36.146 --> 01:18:39.410
-Raise your hands
and turn slowly.

01:18:41.455 --> 01:18:45.895
-I cannot escape you, O God.

01:18:45.895 --> 01:18:48.506
Here is for my eyes.

01:18:48.506 --> 01:18:51.683
Here is for my clothes.

01:18:51.683 --> 01:18:53.772
In you, I rest.

01:18:56.514 --> 01:19:04.696
All that was earthly, all that
was mortal, I embraced it.

01:19:04.696 --> 01:19:06.393
Earth is far gone.

01:19:09.570 --> 01:19:11.790
I fear by your light now.

01:19:24.281 --> 01:19:27.414
Let me mourn for a day.

01:19:27.414 --> 01:19:29.155
Only one day more.

01:19:31.505 --> 01:19:35.945
Let silence
facilitate my prayer.

01:19:35.945 --> 01:19:41.733
Place food to my feet,
and listen to my story.

01:19:46.433 --> 01:19:48.740
I see the doubts
that cloud your mind.

01:19:51.699 --> 01:19:54.267
I know the voice that called you
here.
