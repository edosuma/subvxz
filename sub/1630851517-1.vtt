10:08.303 --> 10:10.174
[clicks off radio]

10:10.218 --> 10:14.396
[chuckles] Could use
a little peace and quiet.

10:15.571 --> 10:17.747
ADULT SHELDON:
With my father home
from the hospital,

10:17.791 --> 10:19.923
my mother had instructed us
to let him relax.

10:19.967 --> 10:23.274
And what could be more relaxing
than a spirited discussion

10:23.318 --> 10:25.407
of societal rules and morality?

10:25.450 --> 10:27.496
SHELDON:
Dad.

10:28.279 --> 10:29.585
What's up?

10:29.629 --> 10:31.326
I'm struggling with
an ethical crisis.

10:31.369 --> 10:32.849
Be a kid. Quit struggling.

10:32.893 --> 10:34.982
Missy and I broke a lot
of rules the other night,

10:35.025 --> 10:36.636
and we've received
no punishment.

10:36.679 --> 10:38.681
[sighs]
Buddy, it's been a rough week.

10:38.725 --> 10:40.857
We're just glad
you're both safe.

10:40.901 --> 10:42.598
But in the absence
of a divine being,

10:42.642 --> 10:45.470
society's rules are what keeps
a person's morality in check.

10:45.514 --> 10:46.776
Well, there you go.

10:46.820 --> 10:49.083
No, y-you're not
following me.

10:49.126 --> 10:50.737
If actions have
no repercussions,

10:50.780 --> 10:53.696
society breaks down,
everything devolves into chaos.

10:53.740 --> 10:55.480
You might be overthinking this.

10:55.524 --> 10:58.179
I thought so, too.
Then I thought about
it, and I'm not.

10:58.222 --> 11:00.877
Sheldon, you had one bad night.

11:00.921 --> 11:02.662
Just let it go.

11:02.705 --> 11:05.490
But... I did something wrong
and I got away with it.

11:05.534 --> 11:07.623
That's not okay.

11:08.493 --> 11:11.322
Buddy...Socrates maintained
that the man

11:11.366 --> 11:14.891
who lies to himself has
an enemy living within.

11:14.935 --> 11:16.327
He's not even
a person.

11:16.371 --> 11:18.852
He's just a chaos
of selfish desires

11:18.895 --> 11:21.506
wrapped in an
animal hide.

11:21.898 --> 11:23.726
Hey. Pastor
Jeff is here.

11:23.770 --> 11:24.901
You up for some company?

11:24.945 --> 11:27.164
You bet!
Got to talk to the pastor. Git.

11:28.035 --> 11:30.298
Hey, George, Sheldon.

11:30.341 --> 11:32.169
Excuse me, I have to "git."

11:32.996 --> 11:35.172
Just wanted to bring by
some get-well cards

11:35.216 --> 11:37.218
from the kids at Sunday school.

11:37.261 --> 11:38.741
Well, isn't that sweet.

11:38.785 --> 11:40.351
Some interesting spellings
of the name "George."

11:40.395 --> 11:41.439
My favorites are

11:41.483 --> 11:43.703
"Gorge" and "Garage."

11:43.746 --> 11:45.879
[chuckles]:
Well, you tell the kids

11:45.922 --> 11:47.924
that Coach Gorge appreciates it.

11:47.968 --> 11:50.013
Will do.You want to sit?

11:50.057 --> 11:51.319
I'm not gonna
stay long.

11:51.362 --> 11:52.712
I just want to pray
over you a little

11:52.755 --> 11:53.756
and let you get some rest.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.715
Oh. Okay, yeah, sure.

11:56.498 --> 12:00.981
Lord, I thank you
for George Cooper

12:01.024 --> 12:02.634
and pray that
you heal him

12:02.678 --> 12:04.245
from the inside out.

12:04.288 --> 12:05.855
This is a good man,

12:05.899 --> 12:08.640
a family man,
a devoted father

12:08.684 --> 12:10.730
and a faithfulhusband.

12:10.773 --> 12:13.776
Bless him and
everything he does.

12:13.820 --> 12:15.691
Amen.

12:16.474 --> 12:18.259
Heck yes, amen!

12:19.086 --> 12:20.478
[knocking]

12:21.262 --> 12:22.219
Hello.

12:22.263 --> 12:23.873
Everything okay?

12:23.917 --> 12:26.571
I'm having a moral quandary, and
I could really use your help.

12:26.615 --> 12:29.096
Oh, moral quandaries.
I hate those.

12:29.139 --> 12:30.401
Shoot.

12:30.445 --> 12:32.229
You're the least moral person
I know--

12:32.273 --> 12:33.622
how do you live with yourself?

12:33.665 --> 12:36.843
I'm about to shut this door
in your face.

12:36.886 --> 12:39.236
See? Other people would be kind
to a child in need.

12:39.280 --> 12:41.543
That's why I came to you.

12:41.935 --> 12:43.240
Okay, fine. What do you want?

12:43.284 --> 12:45.677
I'm confused as to how
to go about my business

12:45.721 --> 12:47.810
after misbehaving
and not being punished.

12:47.854 --> 12:50.900
And where do I come in?You tell lies,

12:50.944 --> 12:52.467
you gamble,
you have quite the potty mouth,

12:52.510 --> 12:55.165
and yet you never seem to pay
a price for any of it.

12:55.209 --> 12:57.167
Well, when you're cute like me,

12:57.211 --> 12:59.213
rules are just
a little different.

12:59.256 --> 13:01.519
Hmm. That would also explain
the endless parade

13:01.563 --> 13:03.217
of romantic partners.

13:05.436 --> 13:07.656
Are you leaving
because you have a man in there?

13:07.699 --> 13:09.223
MEEMAW:
No!

13:09.266 --> 13:13.053
Hmm. Although she would lie
about it, so who knows?

13:13.880 --> 13:16.186
[knocking]Yeah?

13:17.013 --> 13:18.972
Can I talk to you?

13:19.015 --> 13:22.105
Of course. What's up?

13:23.890 --> 13:26.631
I feel really bad
about the other day.

13:26.675 --> 13:28.938
I was so mean to you.

13:29.765 --> 13:31.680
Don't worry about it.

13:31.723 --> 13:34.161
But you were just trying to help
and then I yelled at you

13:34.204 --> 13:35.989
and then you had a heart attack.

13:36.032 --> 13:39.688
[stammers]
That had nothing to do with you.

13:39.731 --> 13:41.864
[crying]:
We don't know that.

13:41.908 --> 13:43.170
Hey. Hey-hey.

13:43.213 --> 13:44.345
Come here.

13:44.388 --> 13:46.042
[sniffling]

13:48.349 --> 13:49.785
[chuckles]

13:49.829 --> 13:52.440
[sighs]I'm so sorry.

13:52.483 --> 13:53.615
Shh.

13:53.658 --> 13:55.008
[sniffles]

13:55.051 --> 13:58.533
How are you doing
with all that... stuff?

13:58.576 --> 14:00.361
You mean Marcus?

14:00.404 --> 14:03.277
You don't have to talk about it
if you don't want to.

14:03.320 --> 14:05.888
It's okay.

14:05.932 --> 14:08.630
[sniffles]So, what happened?

14:08.673 --> 14:11.111
You're not gonna
believe this,

14:11.154 --> 14:14.418
but he was hanging out with
another girl behind my back.

14:17.247 --> 14:18.727
Oh, well...

14:18.770 --> 14:20.816
may-maybe they're
just friends.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.079
Heather M. saw them holding
hands at the roller rink.

14:23.123 --> 14:24.820
Does that sound like
friends to you?

14:24.864 --> 14:26.735
Well... no.

14:26.778 --> 14:27.997
[swallows]

14:28.041 --> 14:29.738
Are all boys liars?

14:29.781 --> 14:31.740
Uh... no.

14:31.783 --> 14:33.916
I mean, how could
he do this to me?

14:33.960 --> 14:35.962
I thought I could trust him.

14:37.485 --> 14:39.530
Did he think
I wouldn't find out?

14:39.574 --> 14:43.273
You know what, kiddo?
I think it's time for Daddy
to take his heart pills.

14:44.666 --> 14:46.146
I'm glad we talked.

14:46.189 --> 14:48.757
[chuckles]:
Oh, me, too, me, too.

14:48.800 --> 14:49.932
Hey.

14:49.976 --> 14:51.368
Hmm?I just wanted
to let you know

14:51.412 --> 14:53.501
I invited Brenda over
for a big thank-you dinner.

14:53.544 --> 14:55.068
[spits]

14:56.896 --> 15:00.421

Oh. Terrific.

15:08.385 --> 15:09.909
[door opens]

15:11.736 --> 15:13.564
What are you doing?

15:13.608 --> 15:15.262
Trying to fix this radio.

15:15.305 --> 15:17.481
Should you be doing
that with a weak heart?

15:17.525 --> 15:19.396
I'm just sitting here.

15:19.440 --> 15:20.658
You look a little sweaty.

15:20.702 --> 15:22.008
What do you want?

15:22.051 --> 15:23.357
I'm gonna go hang
out with Jana.

15:23.400 --> 15:25.925
Just wanted to make sure
you're doing okay.

15:25.968 --> 15:27.274
Hold on.

15:27.317 --> 15:28.971
Are you worried
I'm gonna have a heart attack

15:29.015 --> 15:31.495
and interrupt "private time"
with your girlfriend?

15:31.539 --> 15:32.975
Yes.

15:33.019 --> 15:34.890
At least you're honest.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.065
Glad you think so.

15:36.109 --> 15:37.327
Bye.

15:37.371 --> 15:38.589
See you.

15:38.633 --> 15:41.723
BRENDA [whispers]:
Psst. George.

15:48.382 --> 15:49.600
What's up?

15:49.644 --> 15:51.341
How you doing?

15:51.385 --> 15:52.864
Hanging in.So...

15:52.908 --> 15:56.303
is it weird,
me coming over for dinner?

15:56.346 --> 15:58.000
What do you mean?

15:58.044 --> 16:00.481
You know exactly what I mean.

16:00.524 --> 16:02.962
Brenda,
I had a lot to drink that night.

16:03.005 --> 16:04.833
You know, I don't remember much.

16:05.573 --> 16:07.357
You don't?

16:07.401 --> 16:09.490
No, I do not.

16:10.317 --> 16:13.102
Oh. Okay.

16:13.146 --> 16:15.104
I guess I don't either.

16:15.148 --> 16:17.411
Great. See you at dinner.

16:17.454 --> 16:19.195
Yeah, mm-hmm.

16:22.155 --> 16:25.462
SHELDON:
I still don't understand
why you'd rather work here

16:25.506 --> 16:26.768
than be a physicist.

16:26.811 --> 16:28.726
I'm enjoying the change of pace.

16:28.770 --> 16:31.903
And they let me take home
all the expired food I want.

16:31.947 --> 16:35.168
So, what brings
you here?Well, I did something wrong,

16:35.211 --> 16:36.691
and yet I've received
no punishment.

16:36.734 --> 16:38.127
What's my incentive
to behave morally

16:38.171 --> 16:40.521
if the rules of society
aren't being enforced?

16:40.564 --> 16:44.046
Reminds me of the Ring of Gyges.

16:44.090 --> 16:46.396
I'm not familiar
with the Ring of Gyges.

16:46.440 --> 16:48.616
Oh, it's
a delightful brainteaser.

16:48.659 --> 16:50.792
Plato asked the question:

16:50.835 --> 16:54.056
If you could wear a ring
that made you invisible,

16:54.100 --> 16:56.885
what would prevent you
from committing

16:56.928 --> 16:59.757
the most horrendous crimes?

16:59.801 --> 17:01.716
Sounds an awful lot
like the Ring of Sauron

17:01.759 --> 17:03.283
in The Lord of the Rings.

17:03.326 --> 17:06.634
Oh. I'm not familiar
with The Lord of the Rings.

17:06.677 --> 17:08.462
Oh, it's a delightful series
of fantasy books

17:08.505 --> 17:10.768
in which there's a ring
that makes the wearer invisible

17:10.812 --> 17:12.770
but also leads
to moral corruption.

17:12.814 --> 17:15.904
Ooh. Perhaps you
should read Plato,

17:15.947 --> 17:18.733
and I should read
The Lord of the Rings.

17:18.776 --> 17:20.604
You should really start
with The Hobbit.

17:20.648 --> 17:22.128
What's a hobbit?

17:22.171 --> 17:24.304
It's a race of short humanoids
who live in burrows

17:24.347 --> 17:25.348
and have hairy feet.

17:25.392 --> 17:27.698
Oh. I've been called that.

17:27.742 --> 17:30.397
But I never knew what it was.

If you dare to discover
your destiny...

17:37.099 --> 17:38.579
Hello?

17:38.622 --> 17:40.407
Hey, Brenda.

17:40.450 --> 17:43.105
WOMAN:
Your mind holds
limitless powers...

17:43.149 --> 17:46.065
Oh, I'm so sorry
to hear that.

17:46.978 --> 17:50.330
Well, we'll have to pick
another day, then.

17:50.373 --> 17:51.766
Okay.

17:51.809 --> 17:53.855
Feel better. Bye.

17:55.422 --> 17:57.598
What's going on?

17:57.641 --> 17:59.426
Brenda can't make it to dinner.

17:59.469 --> 18:00.949
She's not feeling well.

18:00.992 --> 18:03.560
Oh, that's too bad.I'll make hera plate

18:03.604 --> 18:05.127
and run it over later.

18:05.171 --> 18:08.043
I can bring that if you want.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.349
You sure?

18:09.392 --> 18:11.525
Yeah. I was a little out of it
at the hospital.

18:11.568 --> 18:13.092
I really want to say thanks.

18:13.135 --> 18:14.919
[door closes in distance]That'd be nice.

18:14.963 --> 18:16.095
GEORGE JR.:
Ooh.

18:16.138 --> 18:18.793
I'm in time for dinner. Good.

18:18.836 --> 18:21.752
'Cause I have worked up
an appetite.

18:23.363 --> 18:25.016
[knocking]

18:29.673 --> 18:31.066
Hi.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.068
Mary wanted to send over
some food,

18:33.112 --> 18:35.157
since you weren't feeling well.

18:36.202 --> 18:37.420
Thank you.

18:39.727 --> 18:42.164
Can we talk a minute?

18:48.779 --> 18:50.999
Look, I'm-I'm sorry
about earlier.

18:51.042 --> 18:54.307
It's okay. I understand.

18:54.350 --> 18:56.744
I just don't want this
to be weird.

18:56.787 --> 18:59.486
We're neighbors.
You and my wife are friends.

18:59.529 --> 19:01.575
Your kids aren't here, right?

19:01.618 --> 19:03.054
No.

19:03.098 --> 19:05.144
S-So, we're-we're neighbors.

19:05.187 --> 19:06.928
You and my wife are friends.

19:06.971 --> 19:09.365
That's why it's weird, George.

19:09.409 --> 19:10.714
But nothing actually happened.

19:10.758 --> 19:13.108
There's no reason
to feel guilty.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.284
Okay.I mean,

19:15.328 --> 19:17.373
did we have too much
to drink? Sure.

19:17.417 --> 19:19.897
Did-did we talk about going home
from the bar together?

19:19.941 --> 19:23.988
Okay, I'm sorry about that.No need to apologize,
'cause we didn't go.

19:24.032 --> 19:28.210
All we did was have a nice time
in a public place. Mm?

19:28.254 --> 19:29.777
Is there anything wrong
with that?

19:29.820 --> 19:30.865
Kind of feels like it.

19:30.908 --> 19:32.258
It does feel like it.

19:32.301 --> 19:35.217
Why does it feel like it?[sighs]

19:35.261 --> 19:36.349
Maybe...

19:38.046 --> 19:43.051
...'cause it was nice to talk
to someone and feel special.
