00:02.330 --> 00:03.897
Tonight on Kitchen Nightmares...

00:03.897 --> 00:06.730
Gordon Ramsay
is in Southern California,

00:06.730 --> 00:09.663
where a sibling rivalry
threatens a legacy

00:09.663 --> 00:11.397
that spans four decades.

00:11.397 --> 00:12.797
It's a battle every day.

00:12.797 --> 00:15.163
They can't work together.
It's a fire.

00:15.163 --> 00:17.197
While sister Celine
may be too aggressive...

00:17.197 --> 00:18.797
Martin, you heard me, right?

00:18.797 --> 00:21.330
Her brother Alex seems to be
too laid back.

00:21.330 --> 00:22.697
You don't give a.

00:22.697 --> 00:24.330
As for the chef,

00:24.330 --> 00:26.163
he is completely fed up.

00:26.163 --> 00:27.763
I'm burning out.

00:27.763 --> 00:29.963
I'm burning, I'm burning,
I'm burning, I'm...

00:29.963 --> 00:30.000
And everyone in the family
is suffering.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.330
And everyone in the family
is suffering.

00:32.330 --> 00:35.497
Every day is a fight.
I can't keep going.

00:35.497 --> 00:38.463
Now, Chef Ramsay must break
through the jealousy...

00:38.463 --> 00:40.063
Are you pissed that she's come
to run the business?

00:40.063 --> 00:41.230
She shouldn't
even be here.

00:41.230 --> 00:42.397
The anger...

00:42.397 --> 00:43.863
This is gonna
up everything.

00:43.863 --> 00:44.863
And the resistance.

00:44.863 --> 00:45.797
You've just
sort of given up.

00:45.797 --> 00:47.463
Have you given up?

00:47.463 --> 00:49.363
So he can fix
this fractured restaurant...

00:49.363 --> 00:50.397
This...

00:50.397 --> 00:51.463
Is much, much worse

00:51.463 --> 00:53.097
than I could ever imagine.

00:53.097 --> 00:55.230
Before it tears
this family apart.

00:55.230 --> 00:56.530
This is destroying us.

00:56.530 --> 00:57.530
That's tonight...

00:59.730 --> 01:00.000
On a very emotional
Kitchen Nightmares.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.430
On a very emotional
Kitchen Nightmares.

01:02.430 --> 01:03.497
I don't even think
that anyone knows

01:03.497 --> 01:04.963
how much I care.

01:24.730 --> 01:26.997
Ventura boulevard,

01:26.997 --> 01:30.000
one of L.A.'s top destinations
for shopping and dining.

01:30.000 --> 01:30.963
one of L.A.'s top destinations
for shopping and dining.

01:30.963 --> 01:32.863
On this famed street
is a landmark restaurant

01:32.863 --> 01:34.664
called La Frite,

01:34.664 --> 01:37.331
a bistro owned by French
immigrant Andre ramillon.

01:37.331 --> 01:40.031
La Frite opened in 1972.

01:40.031 --> 01:42.664
We were the only French
restaurant on the boulevard.

01:42.664 --> 01:44.064
Right this way.

01:44.064 --> 01:45.597
It was always busy,

01:45.597 --> 01:48.297
Even at 12:00 at midnight,
we were packed.

01:48.297 --> 01:49.897
After years of success,

01:49.897 --> 01:54.031
Andre's son Alex was eager
to join his father at La Frite.

01:54.031 --> 01:56.197
I was looking forward
to my dad and myself

01:56.197 --> 01:57.631
making this restaurant work

01:57.631 --> 01:59.797
for the next 15, 20,
30 years.

01:59.797 --> 02:00.000
But two years ago,
Andre's daughter Celine

02:00.000 --> 02:02.397
But two years ago,
Andre's daughter Celine

02:02.397 --> 02:05.564
Decided she also wanted in
on the family business.

02:05.564 --> 02:08.164
Alex, you care this is going out
like this, this soupy?

02:08.164 --> 02:10.497
You're the boss.

02:10.497 --> 02:12.264
I know my brother is not
happy that I'm here.

02:12.264 --> 02:13.897
I know he wishes that

02:13.897 --> 02:15.897
he--it could just keep going
the way he was going.

02:17.564 --> 02:20.331
I think that this restaurant
has so much more potential

02:20.331 --> 02:21.931
than it's already had.

02:21.931 --> 02:24.631
And I really felt like I could
really make a difference here.

02:25.897 --> 02:27.231
I can make this at home.

02:27.231 --> 02:28.231
Not in a good way.

02:28.231 --> 02:30.000
The food is...

02:30.000 --> 02:30.731
The food is...

02:30.731 --> 02:31.864
Mediocre at best.

02:31.864 --> 02:32.964
What do you need?

02:32.964 --> 02:34.197
I've been cooking
at La Frite

02:34.197 --> 02:36.397
for about 19 years.

02:36.397 --> 02:40.131
I'm responsible 100%
for everything in the kitchen.

02:40.131 --> 02:43.731
I don't think the menu is, uh,
there is nothing wrong with it.

02:43.731 --> 02:45.264
Onion soup is bitter.

02:45.264 --> 02:46.697
Onion soup is bitter?

02:46.697 --> 02:48.597
Martin has a Napoleon complex.

02:48.597 --> 02:50.431
Just give me the number table!

02:50.431 --> 02:51.897
He's a little man
with a bit mouth.

02:51.897 --> 02:53.364
Agh!

02:53.364 --> 02:54.931
I've watched the food just
slowly kind of go down

02:54.931 --> 02:56.031
and down and down.

02:56.031 --> 02:58.064
Souffle's coming back.
Too eggy.

02:58.064 --> 03:00.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.031
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:01.031 --> 03:02.164
I've made my comments.

03:02.164 --> 03:03.864
I can't tell anybody
anything.

03:03.864 --> 03:04.931
Um, Alex...

03:04.931 --> 03:06.864
Just...

03:06.864 --> 03:09.531
I get argued with,
or I get told no.

03:09.531 --> 03:10.864
Ah, good ol' Celine.

03:12.297 --> 03:14.997
Well, Alex, he's a little
lackadaisical sometimes.

03:17.264 --> 03:18.764
He resents Celine.

03:18.764 --> 03:20.464
I'm not the manager
tonight.

03:20.464 --> 03:22.831
He feels slighted.
He feels shunned.

03:22.831 --> 03:25.197
My brother and I used to get
along really, really well.

03:25.197 --> 03:26.664
And we were very close.

03:26.664 --> 03:30.000
But the restaurant's hurt our
relationship pretty bad.

03:30.000 --> 03:30.031
But the restaurant's hurt our
relationship pretty bad.

03:30.031 --> 03:31.597
I don't hate Alex.

03:33.797 --> 03:35.264
I know he does.

03:35.264 --> 03:37.431
It's really difficult
for me because

03:37.431 --> 03:40.531
I'm the one who has to be
the buffer for both of them.

03:40.531 --> 03:43.697
I wish, sometimes, they can
understand each other.

03:43.697 --> 03:45.897
It's so quiet in here.

03:45.897 --> 03:48.164
The number's just cut
down to 1/3

03:48.164 --> 03:49.264
of what we were
doing before.

03:49.264 --> 03:53.231
Now, we are dead by 9:00.

03:53.231 --> 03:56.131
Hey, we only did about
20 covers tonight.

03:56.131 --> 03:57.864
It's gonna be tough.

03:57.864 --> 04:00.000
I need Chef Ramsay
to come in

04:00.000 --> 04:00.631
I need Chef Ramsay
to come in

04:00.631 --> 04:02.331
because someone
needs to say,

04:02.331 --> 04:05.197
"hey, look, this is what's
affecting your business."

04:05.197 --> 04:07.164
yeah, it's slowing down,

04:07.164 --> 04:08.931
but why do we need
to change things

04:08.931 --> 04:13.031
when it has been working for
such and such amount of years?

04:14.831 --> 04:16.997
Yeah, we're losing money,
and, uh,

04:16.997 --> 04:19.664
it's time for my kids
to take over.

04:19.664 --> 04:21.164
And if they can't
work together,

04:21.164 --> 04:23.264
just have to close the door.

04:27.731 --> 04:30.000
Before Chef Ramsay makes
the six-mile drive

04:30.000 --> 04:30.631
Before Chef Ramsay makes
the six-mile drive

04:30.631 --> 04:32.231
From his L.A. Restaurant
to La Frite,

04:32.231 --> 04:33.597
owner Andrea ramillon

04:33.597 --> 04:35.497
is anxious to meet with him
privately...

04:35.497 --> 04:36.731
How are you today?

04:36.731 --> 04:37.931
All right.
Welcome to
Gordon Ramsay.

04:37.931 --> 04:39.397
I'm here for Chef Ramsay.

04:39.397 --> 04:40.997
To give Chef Ramsay
a quick briefing

04:40.997 --> 04:43.197
Into the problems
of his restaurant.

04:43.197 --> 04:44.664
Excuse me two seconds.

04:44.664 --> 04:46.397
Hi.
Chef Ramsay.

04:46.397 --> 04:47.597
How are you?
Hi, my name is Andre.

04:47.597 --> 04:48.831
Andre, good to see you.

04:48.831 --> 04:50.664
I want to talk to you
about the problem I have

04:50.664 --> 04:52.597
with my business.
um, first of all,

04:52.597 --> 04:54.131
in terms of the business,

04:54.131 --> 04:55.331
it's been there
for how long?

04:55.331 --> 04:57.397
The business has been
over there for 38 years.

04:57.397 --> 04:59.464
Wow.
It's been good to me.

04:59.464 --> 05:00.000
Until recently,
I'm starting to back up,

05:00.000 --> 05:02.497
Until recently,
I'm starting to back up,

05:02.497 --> 05:05.364
and I want my daughter
and my son to take over.

05:05.364 --> 05:06.531
Oh, so you're
passing to them.

05:06.531 --> 05:07.564
I'm trying to.

05:07.564 --> 05:09.131
And who are they?

05:09.131 --> 05:10.397
Alex.
Alex.

05:10.397 --> 05:11.331
Is my boy.
Okay.

05:11.331 --> 05:12.331
He's the older one.

05:12.331 --> 05:14.097
And Celine is sister.

05:14.097 --> 05:16.664
So what is the number one
problem with the restaurant?

05:16.664 --> 05:18.697
I think it's mostly
the communication.

05:18.697 --> 05:20.797
Right.
Between my daughter
and my son.

05:20.797 --> 05:24.331
But they somehow--
it's a big clash.

05:24.331 --> 05:27.164
Celine went and tried
on her own business,

05:27.164 --> 05:29.531
and...didn't really
work out.

05:29.531 --> 05:30.000
So she came back
and worked for me.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.131
So she came back
and worked for me.

05:31.131 --> 05:35.164
When she came back, Alex
didn't want Celine to come back,

05:35.164 --> 05:37.964
though, because he thought
he owned the place.

05:37.964 --> 05:39.797
They--they never really
work together.

05:39.797 --> 05:43.197
And it's really difficult
to find a solution.

05:43.197 --> 05:45.797
It's getting to a point
where I can't really

05:45.797 --> 05:47.564
handle the conflict
of personality.

05:47.564 --> 05:49.664
And I hope Chef Ramsay
can help.

05:49.664 --> 05:50.597
Thank you
for coming over.

05:50.597 --> 05:51.664
It will be great.

05:51.664 --> 05:53.564
Nice to meet you.
See you shortly.

05:53.564 --> 05:55.364
Okay.

05:58.997 --> 06:00.000
Hello.

06:00.000 --> 06:00.397
Hello.

06:00.397 --> 06:02.064
How are you?
Hi, I'm great.
How are you?

06:02.064 --> 06:03.864
Nice to see you.
And first name is...

06:03.864 --> 06:05.264
Gayle.
I'm the manager.

06:05.264 --> 06:06.431
Okay, great.
How long have you been here?

06:06.431 --> 06:07.964
20 years.
20 years here.

06:07.964 --> 06:09.464
20 years.
Wow, wow, wow.

06:09.464 --> 06:11.664
What's that monstrosity
in the middle there?

06:11.664 --> 06:13.731
It's our dessert case.

06:13.731 --> 06:15.997
It's what?
Your dessert case?

06:15.997 --> 06:16.997
Is there a problem
in the kitchen,

06:16.997 --> 06:18.297
or does it
always stay here?

06:18.297 --> 06:20.997
It's been here for 20 years
that I know of.

06:23.564 --> 06:25.831
Wow. What is this?

06:25.831 --> 06:28.364
That's our dessert tray.
Holy crap.
Did someone drop it?

06:28.364 --> 06:29.664
They could have, heh.

06:29.664 --> 06:30.000
How long has that brick
been sat there?

06:30.000 --> 06:31.964
How long has that brick
been sat there?

06:31.964 --> 06:34.297
That's our homemade
bread pudding.

06:34.297 --> 06:35.797
That's been there,
I think,

06:35.797 --> 06:37.897
longer than you've
been here.

06:37.897 --> 06:39.464
Huh?

06:39.464 --> 06:40.964
Well, they--
yeah, you're right.

06:40.964 --> 06:42.764
Yeah, okay.

06:42.764 --> 06:44.064
Ugh.

06:44.064 --> 06:45.097
Chef Ramsey's right
about the dessert case.

06:45.097 --> 06:47.164
I think it should
be out of here.

06:47.164 --> 06:48.564
Right, where would
you like me to sit, here?
Yes, sir.

06:48.564 --> 06:49.631
I've been trying
to get it out

06:49.631 --> 06:51.097
ever since I've been here.

06:51.097 --> 06:53.131
Can you hear the noise
of that thing, the motor?

06:53.131 --> 06:54.697
Who wants to come out
to a restaurant

06:54.697 --> 06:55.997
and sit next to a fridge?

06:55.997 --> 06:57.697
Constant buzz.

06:57.697 --> 06:59.231
Um, is Andrea round?

06:59.231 --> 07:00.000
Would you like
to see Andre?
Yes, please, yeah.

07:00.000 --> 07:00.964
Would you like
to see Andre?
Yes, please, yeah.

07:00.964 --> 07:02.531
Okay.
Thank you.

07:02.531 --> 07:03.931
Nice meeting you.
Bye-bye.
It's good to see you too.

07:05.564 --> 07:08.997
Dessert fridge
is a disaster.

07:08.997 --> 07:11.064
Andre...
Yes?

07:11.064 --> 07:13.331
Chef Ramsey would
like to see you.
Yeah.

07:13.331 --> 07:15.397
The color's ghastly.

07:17.797 --> 07:19.531
Hello, Gordon.
How are you?

07:19.531 --> 07:20.564
How are you?
All right.

07:20.564 --> 07:21.764
Yeah, good
to see you again.

07:21.764 --> 07:23.397
My daughter.
How are you?
I'm Celine.

07:23.397 --> 07:25.064
Celine good to see you.
Likewise.

07:25.064 --> 07:26.664
She's gonna
take care of you.

07:26.664 --> 07:27.831
Thank you.
Brilliant.

07:27.831 --> 07:30.000
Gordon coming here
was pretty much my idea.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.131
Gordon coming here
was pretty much my idea.

07:31.131 --> 07:32.431
You're gonna look at
the menu for a minute?

07:32.431 --> 07:33.931
Absolute, definite.
I'll be right back.

07:33.931 --> 07:35.497
Thank you, Celine.

07:35.497 --> 07:37.497
Because it's really become
a big pointing-finger match

07:37.497 --> 07:38.497
of it's so-and-so's fault.

07:38.497 --> 07:39.931
Oh, it's so-and-so's fault.

07:39.931 --> 07:42.331
But nobody's taking
responsibility for the problem.

07:42.331 --> 07:44.431
I'm back. You have
any questions for right now?

07:44.431 --> 07:47.497
Um...What quiche
would you recommend?

07:47.497 --> 07:48.864
I prefer the Lorraine.

07:48.864 --> 07:49.997
That's something
we're known for.

07:49.997 --> 07:51.464
Let's do the Lorraine.
The Lorraine?

07:51.464 --> 07:54.497
And then I'll start
with La Frite salad,

07:54.497 --> 07:56.131
and then the seafood crepe.

07:56.131 --> 07:57.331
Not a problem.
Thank you.

07:59.797 --> 08:00.000
Guys, this table that's
coming in right now

08:00.000 --> 08:01.164
Guys, this table that's
coming in right now

08:01.164 --> 08:02.197
is for Gordon.

08:02.197 --> 08:04.297
Seafood crepe.

08:04.297 --> 08:05.964
Quiche Lorraine.

08:05.964 --> 08:08.031
I'll take
the La Frite salad to him.

08:08.031 --> 08:10.264
Chef Ramsey will like
the food because

08:10.264 --> 08:11.497
All my food is good.

08:12.964 --> 08:14.331
How much dressing
would you like?

08:14.331 --> 08:17.797
The usual amount.
About 3/4 to start.

08:17.797 --> 08:19.597
And inside the salad,
what do you got?

08:19.597 --> 08:20.897
Inside the salad
is the romaine,

08:20.897 --> 08:22.164
the, uh, the walnuts,

08:22.164 --> 08:24.231
and you've got
your bleu cheese as well.

08:24.231 --> 08:25.797
And that's one portion?
It's massive.

08:25.797 --> 08:27.231
The salads are large,

08:27.231 --> 08:28.864
and it's usually good
as an entree.

08:28.864 --> 08:29.897
Enjoy.
Thank you.

08:31.397 --> 08:32.497
Wow.

08:37.931 --> 08:39.131
Ah.

08:39.131 --> 08:40.831
It's bland.

08:40.831 --> 08:44.597
The vinaigrette dressing is so--
fridge.

08:44.597 --> 08:47.831
The, um, vinaigrette dressing
is so strong, it's overpowering.

08:47.831 --> 08:48.931
Are you through
with the salad?

08:48.931 --> 08:50.131
Yeah, I am.
May I clear it?

08:50.131 --> 08:52.397
It's so acidic.

08:52.397 --> 08:53.631
Yep.

08:53.631 --> 08:55.297
I already know.

08:55.297 --> 08:57.097
Did you mention it
to the chef?

08:57.097 --> 08:59.031
Yeah, no one
listens to me.

08:59.031 --> 09:00.000
You knew it was wrong,
you told them,

09:00.000 --> 09:00.631
You knew it was wrong,
you told them,

09:00.631 --> 09:01.564
but no one's
listening to you.

09:01.564 --> 09:02.631
Story of my life.

09:02.631 --> 09:04.197
But why is that?

09:04.197 --> 09:05.431
Martin doesn't
listen to me.

09:05.431 --> 09:07.231
And he has an issue taking
anything from a female.

09:07.231 --> 09:08.897
'cause of his
chauvinistic stance?

09:08.897 --> 09:10.464
Yes.
Yeah.
Some of it.

09:10.464 --> 09:11.697
That's absurd.

09:11.697 --> 09:13.031
I understand that.
And that is disgusting.

09:13.031 --> 09:14.131
I'll let him know.

09:14.131 --> 09:15.231
Thank you.

09:15.231 --> 09:16.531
I am embarrassed
by the food.

09:16.531 --> 09:18.931
I just think that it can
all be improved immensely.

09:20.564 --> 09:24.231
Martin, your vinaigrette
is too vinegary, okay?

09:24.231 --> 09:26.531
Wh--you know,
what is wrong with it?

09:26.531 --> 09:29.564
Because we were running
this food for many years.

09:29.564 --> 09:30.000
Martin, you heard me, right?

09:30.000 --> 09:32.631
Martin, you heard me, right?

09:32.631 --> 09:35.131
I'm just letting you guys
know what he's saying, okay?

09:37.464 --> 09:38.897
Thank you.
This is gonna be
the seafood crepe.

09:38.897 --> 09:40.631
I'm gonna set that
in front of you here.

09:40.631 --> 09:42.197
It looks like a pie.

09:42.197 --> 09:43.264
Basically,
they take the dish,

09:43.264 --> 09:44.797
they line it with the--
with the crepes.

09:44.797 --> 09:45.831
They fill it
with the items,

09:45.831 --> 09:47.297
fold it back,
and then they bake it.

09:47.297 --> 09:49.064
They're not like your
typical French crepe.

09:49.064 --> 09:50.031
But why would you
call it a crepe

09:50.031 --> 09:52.397
if it's not really
a crepe?

09:52.397 --> 09:54.331
I think when the seafood crepe
comes out,

09:54.331 --> 09:58.464
it just like a slurpy
mess of...blop.

10:00.031 --> 10:02.531
Can I have a word
with your big brother?

10:02.531 --> 10:04.131
Is he here or not?
He is on Thursday night.

10:04.131 --> 10:05.331
He will be here for dinner
service tonight.

10:05.331 --> 10:06.731
Okay.
All right, enjoy.

10:06.731 --> 10:08.964
Thank you.

10:08.964 --> 10:09.831
Okay.

10:11.131 --> 10:12.131
Oh!

10:14.331 --> 10:16.097
Bleh.
That is hideous.

10:16.097 --> 10:17.831
It's--it's hot in parts,

10:17.831 --> 10:19.097
like in the middle,

10:19.097 --> 10:21.097
but on the side,
they're stone cold.

10:22.797 --> 10:24.397
Want me to take it?

10:24.397 --> 10:25.631
Is the oven not working?

10:25.631 --> 10:27.164
No, the oven's working fine.

10:27.164 --> 10:28.631
You can't serve this

10:28.631 --> 10:30.000
and expect customers
to flow through the door.

10:30.000 --> 10:30.164
and expect customers
to flow through the door.

10:30.164 --> 10:31.697
I understand.
How long has
he been here?

10:31.697 --> 10:33.697
Martin?
Uh-huh.

10:33.697 --> 10:34.697
Too long.

10:34.697 --> 10:36.531
You're not wrong there.

10:36.531 --> 10:39.031
Martin lost his mojo
around here many years ago.

10:39.031 --> 10:40.331
If you've got someone
who doesn't care

10:40.331 --> 10:41.197
about the food
they're putting out,

10:41.197 --> 10:43.264
what do you have?

10:43.264 --> 10:45.431
Martin, he said it's hot
in the middle,

10:45.431 --> 10:46.497
it's cold on the side.

10:46.497 --> 10:48.331
He doesn't like it.

10:54.164 --> 10:55.397
Thank you.

10:56.697 --> 10:58.131
How long has that
been under the grill?

10:58.131 --> 10:59.197
'cause it looks like
it's been overcooked.

10:59.197 --> 11:00.000
It's piping hot.

11:00.000 --> 11:00.231
It's piping hot.

11:00.231 --> 11:01.764
Is he microwaving that?

11:01.764 --> 11:02.831
I don't know.
Gayle...

11:02.831 --> 11:04.364
Yes?

11:04.364 --> 11:05.664
Normally, something's
that piping hot like that

11:05.664 --> 11:07.364
it always tells you
that it's been microwaved.

11:07.364 --> 11:08.664
Can you just check
with the chef?

11:08.664 --> 11:09.797
Okay, I'll check.

11:09.797 --> 11:10.697
Excellent.
Thank you.

11:10.697 --> 11:13.097
Okay, Martin...

11:13.097 --> 11:14.831
The quiche is warmed
in the oven?

11:14.831 --> 11:15.897
Yeah.

11:15.897 --> 11:17.597
Hasn't seen
the microwave?

11:17.597 --> 11:18.764
No.

11:22.164 --> 11:24.031
No. Okay.

11:27.397 --> 11:29.097
Chef...

11:29.097 --> 11:30.000
Um, quiche?

11:30.000 --> 11:30.131
Um, quiche?

11:30.131 --> 11:31.931
No microwave.

11:31.931 --> 11:33.664
I asked him if he
put it in; he said no.

11:33.664 --> 11:35.197
Ah, hold on a minute.

11:35.197 --> 11:37.497
I'm convinced
this has been microwaved.

11:37.497 --> 11:39.064
Look at it.
It's congealed.

11:39.064 --> 11:40.831
It's just like
a rubber puck.

11:40.831 --> 11:43.064
Sometimes, if he
gets a little backed up,

11:43.064 --> 11:44.131
I-I've seen him
do it before.

11:44.131 --> 11:46.097
Backed up?

11:46.097 --> 11:47.164
This is ridiculous.

11:48.264 --> 11:50.131
Uh, let's go and
meet this Martin.

11:50.131 --> 11:51.297
Please.

11:51.297 --> 11:52.597
It's a food issue right now.

11:52.597 --> 11:54.064
And it starts
from the kitchen.

11:54.064 --> 11:55.731
If we had somebody in here
who cared about the food,

11:55.731 --> 11:58.464
we'd be so much better
than we are now.

11:58.464 --> 11:59.797
Martin.
Yes?

11:59.797 --> 12:00.000
Want you to meet
Chef Ramsay.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.297
Want you to meet
Chef Ramsay.

12:01.297 --> 12:03.431
Come round, please.

12:03.431 --> 12:05.031
You're the head chef?

12:05.031 --> 12:06.197
And everything I...

12:06.197 --> 12:08.364
Ate for lunch, you cooked?

12:08.364 --> 12:09.364
Yes, sir.

12:09.364 --> 12:10.664
Lunch was a disaster.

12:13.231 --> 12:15.764
The quiche Lorraine
was rancid.

12:15.764 --> 12:16.964
Where did you
heat that up?

12:16.964 --> 12:18.364
Was that
in the microwave?

12:18.364 --> 12:20.364
Oven.
No, I disagree.

12:20.364 --> 12:21.431
Okay.

12:23.797 --> 12:25.497
We start it
on the microwave

12:25.497 --> 12:26.764
and then we cook it
in the oven, yes.

12:26.764 --> 12:28.131
So it did go
in the microwave?

12:28.131 --> 12:29.764
That is right, yes.

12:29.764 --> 12:30.000
But you just told me
it wasn't in the microwave.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.464
But you just told me
it wasn't in the microwave.

12:33.464 --> 12:34.464
Why do you want
to lie to me?

12:34.464 --> 12:35.531
Do you want me
to lie to you?

12:35.531 --> 12:36.697
I'm not lying to you.

12:36.697 --> 12:37.931
I'm just telling you
how I do it.

12:37.931 --> 12:40.197
I'm so amazed that you're
so laid back

12:40.197 --> 12:41.531
and, like, you don't
give a.

12:42.631 --> 12:43.831
Talk to me.

12:43.831 --> 12:45.331
What do you want me to say?

12:45.331 --> 12:46.431
Why don't you care?

12:46.431 --> 12:48.731
Is it because
you hate Celine?

12:48.731 --> 12:50.797
What does that have to do
with cooking, sir?

12:50.797 --> 12:52.064
'cause she said to me
in the dining room,

12:52.064 --> 12:53.264
every time she tries
to tell you something,

12:53.264 --> 12:55.231
bang!
you jump down her.

12:55.231 --> 12:56.897
She will come
and attack me.

12:56.897 --> 12:58.264
Attack you?
Yes, sir.

12:58.264 --> 13:00.000
Like saying that
I'm in here for too long.

13:00.000 --> 13:00.664
Like saying that
I'm in here for too long.

13:00.664 --> 13:01.897
It's time for me to go.

13:01.897 --> 13:03.297
If you're not prepared
to change,

13:03.297 --> 13:04.464
yeah, I think
she's right.

13:07.364 --> 13:10.964
Okay, if it is time
for me to go, I go.

13:10.964 --> 13:12.631
That was easy.

13:12.631 --> 13:13.697
Martin...

13:23.802 --> 13:26.102
After Chef Ramsay's
miserable lunch...

13:26.102 --> 13:28.102
Bleh. That is hideous.

13:28.102 --> 13:29.535
Lunch was a disaster.

13:29.535 --> 13:31.635
Chef Martinez not interested

13:31.635 --> 13:32.735
in hearing any criticism.

13:32.735 --> 13:34.702
If it is time
for me to go, I go.

13:34.702 --> 13:37.535
And is ready to say good-bye
to La Frite.

13:37.535 --> 13:38.735
Martin!

13:42.935 --> 13:45.435
That's why I feel like
I've been attacked.

13:45.435 --> 13:46.869
Martin...

13:46.869 --> 13:48.102
Talk to me.

13:48.102 --> 13:49.202
She just don't understand

13:49.202 --> 13:50.202
how much of the stress

13:50.202 --> 13:50.566
and pressure I've been under!

13:50.566 --> 13:51.602
and pressure I've been under!

13:51.602 --> 13:53.035
I'm burning out.

13:53.035 --> 13:56.135
I'm burning, I'm burning,
I'm burning, I'm...

13:56.135 --> 13:57.269
Well, tell me.

13:57.269 --> 13:58.835
Do you know how much
the stress is

13:58.835 --> 14:01.602
when I know that I
have to work with her?

14:01.602 --> 14:03.535
And I cannot
work like that.

14:03.535 --> 14:04.802
I feel burned out.

14:04.802 --> 14:07.969
Celine, you know,
is over power her,

14:07.969 --> 14:09.602
you know, authority
as a boss.

14:09.602 --> 14:10.969
And there's nothing
I can do.

14:10.969 --> 14:13.735
Even the own brother
runs away from her.

14:13.735 --> 14:15.902
Like, you know, he doesn't
want to deal with her.

14:15.902 --> 14:17.635
That's not right.

14:17.635 --> 14:18.902
Martin...

14:18.902 --> 14:20.566
Now I've got
your side of the story.

14:20.566 --> 14:20.702
Now I've got
your side of the story.

14:20.702 --> 14:22.969
Can I...

14:22.969 --> 14:26.302
I wanna see how you cook
on a busy night's service, okay?

14:26.302 --> 14:28.169
I'll see you later.

14:28.169 --> 14:30.235
Jeez.

14:35.802 --> 14:37.902
It's 30 minutes before
dinner service,

14:37.902 --> 14:39.469
And Celine's brother Alex...

14:39.469 --> 14:40.802
What's up, you guys?

14:40.802 --> 14:42.735
Arrives to begin his shift.

14:42.735 --> 14:43.802
Any updates?

14:43.802 --> 14:45.635
Gordon didn't
make me cry.

14:45.635 --> 14:46.502
He was actually
nice to me.

14:46.502 --> 14:47.735
Uh-huh.

14:47.735 --> 14:48.835
That's nice.

14:48.835 --> 14:50.566
Um...

14:50.566 --> 14:51.169
Um...

14:51.169 --> 14:52.635
Tonight'll be fun.

14:52.635 --> 14:54.402
Chef Ramsay's gonna be
coming into this restaurant

14:54.402 --> 14:55.469
changing things.

14:55.469 --> 14:57.402
So do I feel resistant?

14:57.402 --> 14:59.069
Definitely.

14:59.069 --> 15:00.835
Guys...

15:00.835 --> 15:02.902
Look alive.
Gordon's comin' in now.

15:04.035 --> 15:05.435
Good evening.

15:05.435 --> 15:07.002
Hey, Chef.
Well, hello.

15:07.002 --> 15:08.069
How are you doing,
Chef Ramsay?

15:08.069 --> 15:09.235
I'm Alex.
Alex, good to see you.

15:09.235 --> 15:10.469
So you're the big brother.

15:10.469 --> 15:11.635
Yeah, I'm the big guy.
Excellent.

15:11.635 --> 15:12.669
Little sis.

15:12.669 --> 15:13.969
Big brother.
And where's dad?

15:13.969 --> 15:15.635
Dad, uh, you know what?

15:15.635 --> 15:16.935
Hockey game tonight?

15:16.935 --> 15:18.669
He's what?
He's gone to a hockey game?

15:18.669 --> 15:20.035
Wow, okay.

15:20.035 --> 15:20.566
Um, two minutes with you
to catch up.

15:20.566 --> 15:21.702
Um, two minutes with you
to catch up.

15:21.702 --> 15:23.002
All right.

15:23.002 --> 15:25.035
So why weren't you here
at lunch time?

15:25.035 --> 15:26.535
Um...

15:26.535 --> 15:28.135
You're part-owner
of this business, right?

15:28.135 --> 15:29.535
Mm-hmm.

15:29.535 --> 15:30.569
But you never work
with your sister.

15:30.569 --> 15:33.135
Uh, no, we work
separate nights.

15:33.135 --> 15:34.335
Right.

15:34.335 --> 15:35.469
Your father came
to see me this morning.

15:35.469 --> 15:37.335
Oh, okay.
To tell me
the conflict

15:37.335 --> 15:38.602
about you two
not working together.

15:38.602 --> 15:39.869
Mm-hmm.

15:39.869 --> 15:41.469
So why is there so much
conflict in here?

15:41.469 --> 15:43.769
I think the real conflict
is the--the--

15:43.769 --> 15:45.769
who wants to control
and what--

15:45.769 --> 15:47.335
you know, wants
to control things.

15:47.335 --> 15:49.735
Are you pissed that she's
come to run the business?

15:50.769 --> 15:52.169
She shouldn't even be here.

15:53.369 --> 15:54.269
I would rather
her not be here.

15:56.702 --> 15:57.969
But it's your little sis.

15:57.969 --> 16:00.402
Wouldn't you be stronger
and better with your...

16:00.402 --> 16:01.402
No.

16:02.835 --> 16:04.202
Unfortunately, no.

16:04.202 --> 16:06.235
So what's wrong with
this restaurant in your mind?

16:06.235 --> 16:09.402
Mmm...I don't see anything
wrong with it, so...

16:09.402 --> 16:10.869
You don't see
anything wrong?

16:10.869 --> 16:12.602
There's not a problem with
this restaurant anywhere?

16:12.602 --> 16:15.135
You know, I would
change the bathrooms.

16:15.135 --> 16:16.502
I would change
the different physical--

16:16.502 --> 16:18.635
wow.

16:18.635 --> 16:20.566
I'm not here
to make you look stupid.

16:20.566 --> 16:20.602
I'm not here
to make you look stupid.

16:20.602 --> 16:21.802
All right.

16:21.802 --> 16:23.735
But you're sounding
ridiculous.

16:23.735 --> 16:25.002
Let me ask you again:

16:25.002 --> 16:26.069
what the
is wrong with the restaurant?

16:26.069 --> 16:27.835
Um...

16:30.769 --> 16:32.302
In your eyes, there's nothing
much wrong with it.

16:32.302 --> 16:34.035
Well, let's go.

16:34.035 --> 16:35.935
We'll--we'll see.

16:35.935 --> 16:37.002
Okay.

16:37.002 --> 16:38.235
Well, thanks
for the insight.

16:38.235 --> 16:40.902
Yeah...Absolutely.

16:40.902 --> 16:41.935
Ay yi yi.

16:43.402 --> 16:45.702
If he's not gonna be willing
to accept this

16:45.702 --> 16:46.869
and move on,

16:46.869 --> 16:48.935
and take it as
constructive criticism,

16:48.935 --> 16:50.169
it's not gonna work.

16:50.169 --> 16:50.566
All right, you guys.
We ready?

16:50.566 --> 16:51.969
All right, you guys.
We ready?

16:55.969 --> 16:57.835
Hello there.
Hi.

16:57.835 --> 16:59.269
While Andre is at
the hockey game...

16:59.269 --> 17:00.735
Hi, ladies.
How are you?

17:00.735 --> 17:02.269
His two children,
Celine and Alex,

17:02.269 --> 17:04.102
Are working a rare night
together.

17:04.102 --> 17:06.935
Which is good, because
the restaurant is packed

17:06.935 --> 17:08.769
as word has spread
that Chef Ramsay

17:08.769 --> 17:10.002
is at La Frite.

17:10.002 --> 17:11.702
I'm gonna have
the chopped salad.

17:11.702 --> 17:13.369
And you're doing
the lamb special.

17:13.369 --> 17:14.969
Okay, uh, risotto.

17:14.969 --> 17:16.035
Tresspecial.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.369
Three working, three.

17:17.369 --> 17:19.402
I'm proud to be
doing the cooking.

17:19.402 --> 17:20.566
Because I know
what I'm doing.

17:20.566 --> 17:21.002
Because I know
what I'm doing.

17:21.002 --> 17:23.269
Excuse me, when you
put things on the grill there,

17:23.269 --> 17:25.069
you don't season it?
salt, pepper in--

17:26.669 --> 17:27.569
there's nothing on there.

17:29.702 --> 17:30.635
Right now?
Yeah.

17:30.635 --> 17:31.969
What do you mean,
right now?

17:31.969 --> 17:34.035
When were you going
to season them then?

17:34.035 --> 17:35.035
Yeah, right now.

17:35.035 --> 17:36.802
Right now..

17:36.802 --> 17:38.535
There's no seasoning
on there.

17:38.535 --> 17:40.235
They should--
I think they--

17:40.235 --> 17:41.835
don't they salt and pepper it
when they put it on the grill?

17:41.835 --> 17:43.069
Yeah, well, they're not.

17:43.069 --> 17:44.435
They're not?

17:44.435 --> 17:45.569
Martin.

17:47.135 --> 17:49.135
Martin.

17:49.135 --> 17:50.566
Martin and I have
never gotten along.

17:50.566 --> 17:50.969
Martin and I have
never gotten along.

17:50.969 --> 17:52.602
He ignores me.
I don't get answers.

17:52.602 --> 17:54.502
Alex can talk to Martin.

17:54.502 --> 17:56.335
But Martin does not like
hearing anything from me.

17:59.935 --> 18:01.502
What is that?

18:01.502 --> 18:03.035
That's quiche,
but it's been overcooked.

18:03.035 --> 18:04.402
You're kidding me.

18:04.402 --> 18:06.169
They don't listen
to my opinions

18:06.169 --> 18:07.369
because it's me.
Martin.

18:07.369 --> 18:08.535
Yeah, talk to me!

18:08.535 --> 18:09.935
Yeah, come round, please.

18:09.935 --> 18:11.102
I am talking to you.

18:11.102 --> 18:12.669
Yes, sir.
Are you serious?

18:12.669 --> 18:14.735
Okay, one more
coming up.

18:14.735 --> 18:17.935
I just said to Martin, "would
you come round for a minute?"

18:17.935 --> 18:19.135
he's serving that.

18:20.635 --> 18:23.035
You don't walk away
and ignore me.

18:23.035 --> 18:25.969
Alex has never taken
confrontation well.

18:25.969 --> 18:27.135
You try and talk to him
about something,

18:27.135 --> 18:28.302
and he just walks away.

18:31.069 --> 18:32.169
Are you taking a round,

18:32.169 --> 18:33.502
or are you ignoring me
like this?

18:33.502 --> 18:35.069
You've just sort of given up.
Have you given up?

18:35.069 --> 18:36.535
I have not given up.
Absolutely not.

18:38.835 --> 18:40.369
It's wonderful?
Uh-huh.

18:46.902 --> 18:49.202
Wow. This is the most
disorganized restaurant

18:49.202 --> 18:50.235
I've ever seen.

18:50.235 --> 18:50.566
Martin the chef,
he's burnt out.

18:50.566 --> 18:52.469
Martin the chef,
he's burnt out.

18:52.469 --> 18:56.235
Alex, well, he's so laid back,
he's almost comatose.

18:56.235 --> 18:58.235
Andre, the owner,
who makes all the decisions,

18:58.235 --> 18:59.635
he's at a frickin'
hockey game.

18:59.635 --> 19:01.269
And the only one who cares,
Celine,

19:01.269 --> 19:02.835
everybody ignores her.

19:02.835 --> 19:04.402
Unbelievable.
Oh, by the way,

19:04.402 --> 19:05.869
the food sucks.

19:05.869 --> 19:07.102
Unreal.

19:08.735 --> 19:11.635
It's chewy,
and the sauce is just gooey.

19:13.669 --> 19:15.569
Oh, no.
I'm sorry.

19:15.569 --> 19:18.102
Uh...

19:18.102 --> 19:19.469
They said the lamb
has no flavor.

19:19.469 --> 19:20.566
Yep. Okay.

19:20.566 --> 19:20.969
Yep. Okay.

19:20.969 --> 19:23.269
I know why it doesn't.
We didn't salt and pepper it.

19:23.269 --> 19:24.635
He's not even seasoning it?

19:24.635 --> 19:25.969
Okay, bring 'em a menu.

19:25.969 --> 19:28.469
Let Alex know what
table it is, please.

19:28.469 --> 19:30.169
Alex...But that's
just coming back now.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.302
Thanks, Gordon.

19:31.302 --> 19:33.369
Thanks a lot.

19:34.735 --> 19:36.669
Is this normal
that he doesn't care?

19:36.669 --> 19:37.669
Yes. Mm-hmm.

19:37.669 --> 19:38.669
Celine...

19:41.535 --> 19:42.669
You better get a grip.

19:42.669 --> 19:43.669
I can't get
in the middle.

19:43.669 --> 19:45.102
And it's really sad.

19:45.102 --> 19:47.502
We've been running
the restaurant for 38 years.

19:47.502 --> 19:48.835
And things
don't need to change.

19:48.835 --> 19:50.435
You're not real.

19:52.669 --> 19:54.302
It hurts.

19:54.302 --> 19:55.635
I love my brother,
and I know he's better

19:55.635 --> 19:57.135
than what he's doing here
right now.

19:57.135 --> 20:00.869
I wish he would realize
that everybody's here to help.

20:00.869 --> 20:02.135
Otherwise, uh...

20:02.135 --> 20:04.669
Alex will ruin me.

20:04.669 --> 20:06.802
Alex...Look at me.

20:06.802 --> 20:08.602
Don't bully your sister.
Bully me.

20:08.602 --> 20:10.069
I'm not bullying
anybody, Gordon.

20:11.502 --> 20:12.635
Take a bit
of responsibility.

20:12.635 --> 20:13.969
I am.

20:13.969 --> 20:14.969
Wow.

20:14.969 --> 20:16.769
What a  sponge.

20:16.769 --> 20:18.502
This is destroying us.

20:18.502 --> 20:20.502
What a  attitude.

20:32.089 --> 20:33.856
It's only an hour into
a shaky dinner service.

20:33.856 --> 20:35.523
This is gonna
up everything.

20:35.523 --> 20:37.523
You better get a grip.

20:37.523 --> 20:38.756
And Chef Ramsay is frustrated

20:38.756 --> 20:39.956
With Alex's arrogance.

20:39.956 --> 20:41.023
Alex, I-I can't--

20:41.023 --> 20:42.256
I'm not gonna
get in the middle.

20:42.256 --> 20:44.256
As for Celine...

20:44.256 --> 20:45.989
She is clearly
feeling the resentment

20:45.989 --> 20:47.356
from her brother.

20:47.356 --> 20:48.923
What a  attitude.

20:50.489 --> 20:52.523
He thinks I did this
to set him up.

20:52.523 --> 20:53.623
Stop crying.

20:55.289 --> 20:56.389
Stop crying.

20:56.389 --> 20:57.593
The anger.
I can see the anger.

20:57.593 --> 20:59.656
The anger.
I can see the anger.

20:59.656 --> 21:01.356
It's got to come out now.

21:01.356 --> 21:02.456
I understand, yeah.

21:02.456 --> 21:03.456
Y'all have to do it.

21:03.456 --> 21:05.223
You have
to work together.

21:05.223 --> 21:06.423
You have to get along.

21:06.423 --> 21:07.689
Every day is a fight.

21:07.689 --> 21:09.056
What am I supposed to do?

21:09.056 --> 21:10.889
I can't keep going.

21:10.889 --> 21:13.923
And I feel like
I'm the only one fighting.

21:13.923 --> 21:15.456
So everybody looks at me
like I'm the bitch.

21:15.456 --> 21:16.456
I'm the one who's fighting.

21:22.856 --> 21:25.856
I don't even think that
anyone knows how much I care.

21:25.856 --> 21:27.593
I think the man's here
to work it out with you.

21:27.593 --> 21:28.523
I think the man's here
to work it out with you.

21:28.523 --> 21:30.123
I just move on.

21:30.123 --> 21:31.956
I...Take a breath and...

21:31.956 --> 21:33.723
Push through it.
That's it.

21:33.723 --> 21:35.489
There's nothing else
I can do.

21:35.489 --> 21:36.689
Can you call your dad?

21:36.689 --> 21:38.523
Can I--can you get
your dad on the phone?

21:38.523 --> 21:39.689
I'll try.
Get him here.
Would you?

21:39.689 --> 21:41.456
Get him here?
Please, yeah.

21:41.456 --> 21:43.289
I'm ready to go.

21:43.289 --> 21:44.823
And tell him it's urgent.
I will.

21:44.823 --> 21:46.856
And if he can't be bothered
to get his ass over here

21:46.856 --> 21:48.223
to look at the mess
that he's left,

21:48.223 --> 21:49.956
I'm out of here.

21:55.523 --> 21:57.593
Hi. Papa, you need
to see this right now.

21:57.593 --> 21:58.256
Hi. Papa, you need
to see this right now.

21:58.256 --> 22:00.156
A lot of food's coming back,
you know,

22:00.156 --> 22:02.723
and just Alex is really
just kind of nonchalant

22:02.723 --> 22:03.989
about the whole thing,

22:03.989 --> 22:06.323
and it's really kind of
pissing Gordon off.

22:06.323 --> 22:09.089
He--the same attitude
he always takes, papa.

22:09.089 --> 22:11.123
You know exactly--
you know?

22:11.123 --> 22:13.256
Okay. Bye.

22:23.223 --> 22:24.823
Andre, you got two seconds?

22:26.089 --> 22:27.456
Unbelievable.

22:27.456 --> 22:27.593
First of all,
I'm slightly concerned

22:27.593 --> 22:29.456
First of all,
I'm slightly concerned

22:29.456 --> 22:31.956
you weren't even here.

22:31.956 --> 22:33.356
This is much, much worse

22:33.356 --> 22:35.623
than I could ever imagine.

22:35.623 --> 22:36.689
The worst thing of all

22:36.689 --> 22:38.989
is Alex's attitude.

22:41.423 --> 22:44.056
With me? He has
an attitude with himself.

22:44.056 --> 22:47.423
Why is he so arrogant?

22:58.989 --> 23:01.756
He hates her being

23:01.756 --> 23:03.356
anywhere near him
in the restaurant.

23:03.356 --> 23:05.556
Whilst they're
avoiding each other...

23:05.556 --> 23:06.656
Oh, yeah.

23:06.656 --> 23:07.989
And doing
their separate things,

23:07.989 --> 23:10.456
the kitchen is diving.

23:10.456 --> 23:12.156
It's sinking, quicker

23:12.156 --> 23:14.089
than thetitanic.

23:16.089 --> 23:18.289
You can't leave it
all to me.

23:18.289 --> 23:20.189
I can't help you

23:20.189 --> 23:22.356
unless you start
helping yourself.

23:22.356 --> 23:24.256
I'll see you
in the morning.

23:25.689 --> 23:27.256
Mon oui.

23:31.889 --> 23:33.656
After a long night
of contemplating

23:33.656 --> 23:35.156
La Frite's main issue...

23:35.156 --> 23:37.223
Good morning.
How are you?
Good morning.

23:37.223 --> 23:39.089
Chef Ramsey is focused
on bringing this family

23:39.089 --> 23:40.289
Back together.

23:40.289 --> 23:42.256
I can't begin to fix
this restaurant

23:42.256 --> 23:45.689
because there's so many
personal problems here.

23:45.689 --> 23:47.256
Because nobody's opening up
in front of each other,

23:47.256 --> 23:48.323
I want to try something.

23:48.323 --> 23:49.689
So I just want you
to bear with me.

23:49.689 --> 23:50.656
Come with me two seconds.
Okay.

23:50.656 --> 23:51.823
Please.

23:51.823 --> 23:53.289
Take a seat.

23:54.589 --> 23:56.989
I want you
to sit here,

23:56.989 --> 23:57.593
watch, and listen

23:57.593 --> 23:58.589
watch, and listen

23:58.589 --> 24:01.223
what's happening between
Celine and Alex.

24:01.223 --> 24:03.889
Don't leave this space.

24:03.889 --> 24:05.356
I'm gonna go
talk to Celine.

24:07.323 --> 24:09.523
How are you?
Good, how are you?

24:09.523 --> 24:10.723
I'm well.
Good to see you.

24:10.723 --> 24:12.389
Yeah, uh,
darling, take a seat.

24:12.389 --> 24:13.389
Let's just have
a catch-up.

24:15.323 --> 24:18.023
Okay.
That was tough.

24:18.023 --> 24:20.223
Tough night last night.

24:20.223 --> 24:23.956
This restaurant's been
running for 38 years.

24:23.956 --> 24:25.156
But the legacy's
not gonna continue

24:25.156 --> 24:26.189
with this kind
of attitude.
yeah.

24:26.189 --> 24:27.593
The fragmented
relationships

24:27.593 --> 24:27.623
The fragmented
relationships

24:27.623 --> 24:29.523
between the families
is incredible.

24:29.523 --> 24:30.889
You and Alex
are so disconnected.

24:30.889 --> 24:33.589
How did it get
to where it is today?

24:33.589 --> 24:35.823
Communication broke down.

24:37.256 --> 24:39.089
But underneath all that,

24:39.089 --> 24:41.856
deep down inside,
do you think Alex resents you?

24:41.856 --> 24:43.523
I know Alex resents me.

24:43.523 --> 24:45.456
Tell me why.

24:45.456 --> 24:47.989
I think that he feels like
he's the older brother,

24:47.989 --> 24:49.423
and the he thought
this was his.

24:49.423 --> 24:50.823
He thought that he was
gonna be able to run it

24:50.823 --> 24:52.123
the way he wanted, and...

24:52.123 --> 24:54.556
His world came crashing down.

24:54.556 --> 24:56.256
Your relationship
with your father,

24:56.256 --> 24:57.593
is it different
to the relationship

24:57.593 --> 24:57.723
is it different
to the relationship

24:57.723 --> 24:59.289
he has with Alex?

24:59.289 --> 25:00.523
Yeah.

25:00.523 --> 25:02.723
I think that he thinks
that my dad...

25:02.723 --> 25:05.089
In the end loves me more,
for some reason.

25:10.089 --> 25:11.423
Hi.

25:11.423 --> 25:12.456
Hey.
How are you?

25:12.456 --> 25:13.656
I'm doing good.
Sit down.

25:13.656 --> 25:15.089
We were just
talking about you.

25:15.089 --> 25:16.556
Oh, yeah?

25:16.556 --> 25:18.123
Why don't you just
explain to Alex

25:18.123 --> 25:19.189
what you just
explained to me.

25:19.189 --> 25:22.323
I said we used to be
very close.

25:22.323 --> 25:23.756
But I think
that you're bitter

25:23.756 --> 25:25.389
Towards a lot of things.

25:25.389 --> 25:27.593
You've got
a lot of resentment.

25:27.593 --> 25:28.156
You've got
a lot of resentment.

25:28.156 --> 25:29.656
I don't know if it's only
towards me,

25:29.656 --> 25:30.689
if it's towards
other things.

25:30.689 --> 25:32.323
I don't see you...

25:32.323 --> 25:34.123
Wanting to--
to come here.

25:36.223 --> 25:39.889
It felt like he was gonna
give you the restaurant.

25:39.889 --> 25:41.556
I felt like,

25:41.556 --> 25:44.923
you know, I was losing...

25:44.923 --> 25:47.723
Not only the passion
and the pride,

25:47.723 --> 25:50.356
but the--the whole
aspect of the restaurant.

25:50.356 --> 25:53.189
I still have that

25:53.189 --> 25:56.389
uneasy...feeling like...

25:56.389 --> 25:57.456
Do I belong?

25:57.456 --> 25:57.593
I put that wall up.

25:57.593 --> 25:59.256
I put that wall up.

25:59.256 --> 26:00.256
Yes, I did.

26:03.023 --> 26:04.289
I can't do it--

26:04.289 --> 26:06.223
I've said a million times,
I can't do it alone.

26:06.223 --> 26:08.289
You know that.
You know that.

26:15.756 --> 26:17.223
I'm not here to hurt you.

26:17.223 --> 26:19.423
No.
I'm not.

26:19.423 --> 26:21.289
I'm not here to step on you
in any way.

26:26.856 --> 26:27.593
This is the first time

26:27.593 --> 26:28.056
This is the first time

26:28.056 --> 26:29.256
that I got to look at you
in the eyes

26:29.256 --> 26:32.989
and knowing that
you're serious about it.

26:32.989 --> 26:35.623
The separation between
my sister and I

26:35.623 --> 26:36.989
definitely wasn't working,

26:36.989 --> 26:39.489
and she made me,
you know, realize

26:39.489 --> 26:41.056
we need to get unionized,

26:41.056 --> 26:42.723
and we need to get together
with each other,

26:42.723 --> 26:43.823
and--and work together.

26:43.823 --> 26:45.456
I wanna do it with you.

26:45.456 --> 26:46.756
Yeah.

26:46.756 --> 26:47.989
Okay.

26:47.989 --> 26:49.256
Okay.

26:52.123 --> 26:53.523
I love her, and of--

26:53.523 --> 26:55.123
of course we're gonna
work together.

26:55.123 --> 26:57.489
That's good to hear,
'cause I don't...

26:57.489 --> 26:57.593
I really have thought
you hated me for a long time.

26:57.593 --> 26:59.589
I really have thought
you hated me for a long time.

26:59.589 --> 27:01.089
I think she needs a hug.

27:01.089 --> 27:02.623
You're her big brother
for God's sake.

27:07.789 --> 27:09.956
We've got to figure out
just a way to talk again.

27:09.956 --> 27:11.689
We used to talk.
We used to--

27:11.689 --> 27:12.756
we used to have fun.

27:12.756 --> 27:15.456
We used to--
we used to be best friends.

27:15.456 --> 27:16.789
This feels incredible.

27:16.789 --> 27:18.823
It's the most important
thing for the restaurant

27:18.823 --> 27:19.823
for my brother and I
to be family

27:19.823 --> 27:22.789
and for--
for us to get along.

27:22.789 --> 27:24.356
And for us
to love each other.

27:24.356 --> 27:26.123
Let me leave you guys for
a couple of minutes on your own.

27:26.123 --> 27:27.189
Thank you.

27:27.189 --> 27:27.593
Okay, gonna
get some fresh air.

27:27.593 --> 27:29.256
Okay, gonna
get some fresh air.

27:31.289 --> 27:32.823
The walls kind of came down,

27:32.823 --> 27:34.823
which is exactly what
needed to happen

27:34.823 --> 27:35.856
for this family.

27:35.856 --> 27:37.923
She definitely showed me

27:37.923 --> 27:40.489
that we need
to respect each other

27:40.489 --> 27:42.756
and that the respect
for each other

27:42.756 --> 27:45.023
is what's gonna make
La Frite succeed.

27:47.923 --> 27:50.123
If we can continue
the legacy

27:50.123 --> 27:52.256
and continue the heartbeat
of La Frite...

27:52.256 --> 27:55.556
You've got an amazing
son and daughter there

27:55.556 --> 27:57.593
that are desperate
to get this place right.

27:57.593 --> 27:57.923
that are desperate
to get this place right.

27:57.923 --> 27:59.923
Huh?
I hope.

27:59.923 --> 28:01.689
That's one thing
I really want

28:01.689 --> 28:03.856
is all us three
to communicate

28:03.856 --> 28:05.456
or talk to each other.

28:05.456 --> 28:06.556
And, you know,
it was hurting me.

28:08.189 --> 28:10.189
It's...
One step at a time.

28:10.189 --> 28:11.423
Yeah, that's it.

28:19.223 --> 28:20.823
I love you.

28:21.989 --> 28:23.423
I love you.

28:23.423 --> 28:25.489
I love you.

29:04.468 --> 29:07.234
After a breakthrough
emotional meeting

29:07.234 --> 29:08.501
Between Alex and Celine...

29:08.501 --> 29:10.001
I love her, and of--

29:10.001 --> 29:11.534
of course we're gonna
work together.

29:11.534 --> 29:13.434
Chef Ramsay is now ready

29:13.434 --> 29:15.034
to start implementing
some changes.

29:15.034 --> 29:17.534
Gone is the 20-year-old
dessert case

29:17.534 --> 29:19.768
that sat in the middle
of the dining room.

29:19.768 --> 29:21.001
Oh,  fridge.

29:22.834 --> 29:27.234
And in its place,
a contemporary crepe station.

29:27.234 --> 29:28.234
There you go.

29:30.434 --> 29:30.672
We're gonna start
doing some crepes.

29:30.672 --> 29:32.201
We're gonna start
doing some crepes.

29:32.201 --> 29:34.034
For tonight's menu,

29:34.034 --> 29:35.268
Chef Ramsay is replacing

29:35.268 --> 29:38.034
the soggy, heavy
casserole crepes...

29:38.034 --> 29:39.634
Bleh.

29:39.634 --> 29:41.434
With fresh, light,
traditional crepes.

29:41.434 --> 29:42.434
Try that.

29:42.434 --> 29:43.701
That's excellent.

29:43.701 --> 29:44.534
Yeah.
It's really good.

29:49.334 --> 29:50.634
You'll be our first
table tonight.

29:50.634 --> 29:51.868
Best table in the house.

29:51.868 --> 29:53.701
Tonight, Alex will once again

29:53.701 --> 29:55.834
Be in charge of
the front of the house.

29:55.834 --> 29:58.701
But he will also be supervising
the new crepe station

29:58.701 --> 29:59.801
and will be assisted
by Gayle.

30:03.334 --> 30:05.568
As for Celine,
she will be in the kitchen

30:05.568 --> 30:09.001
expediting and working alongside
chef Martin.

30:09.001 --> 30:12.634
Martin, you and I are gonna
really need to chat.

30:12.634 --> 30:14.134
I am gonna go completely
off the specials.

30:14.134 --> 30:15.101
Sounds good.

30:15.101 --> 30:16.868
The smoked salmon crepe?

30:16.868 --> 30:18.101
Okay, is it all up?

30:20.101 --> 30:21.868
What is that?
It's an omelet.

30:21.868 --> 30:22.768
Do you want
to do it again?

30:22.768 --> 30:24.334
You tell me.

30:24.334 --> 30:25.334
Can he not
cook an omelet?

30:25.334 --> 30:26.534
He should be able to.

30:26.534 --> 30:29.401
Can I get two new ones?

30:29.401 --> 30:30.668
Is anybody listening?

30:30.668 --> 30:30.672
Yes!

30:30.672 --> 30:32.201
Yes!

30:32.201 --> 30:33.434
I'm ready for
the cordon bleu.

30:33.434 --> 30:35.101
Martin,

30:35.101 --> 30:36.968
try to communicate,
please.

30:36.968 --> 30:38.434
Right here.

30:39.601 --> 30:41.034
What is that?

30:41.034 --> 30:42.268
Cordon bleu.

30:42.268 --> 30:43.834
Look at that, it's
a  a sandwich.

30:43.834 --> 30:45.334
Andre, Martin.

30:45.334 --> 30:46.534
Just stop and come round.

30:46.534 --> 30:49.201
Look at me.
Look at me in the eyes.

30:49.201 --> 30:51.834
Look.
I can't serve that.

30:51.834 --> 30:54.734
That's that?

30:54.734 --> 30:55.701
It shouldn't be like that.

30:55.701 --> 30:56.834
Like a  oil slick.

30:56.834 --> 30:58.101
Come on, guys.

30:58.101 --> 30:59.468
Papa, will you tell him?

30:59.468 --> 31:00.634
We don't drown it
in there.

31:03.834 --> 31:06.068
My nine-year-old daughter
can cook better than that.

31:06.068 --> 31:07.234
Martin.
Yes?

31:07.234 --> 31:08.534
I just want you to care.

31:08.534 --> 31:09.768
Yeah, I--
I got that.

31:11.568 --> 31:13.201
I'm struggling.

31:15.301 --> 31:16.434
There's a little
communication

31:16.434 --> 31:17.401
trying to get
everything fired.

31:17.401 --> 31:19.168
Who's making
the croque monsieur?

31:19.168 --> 31:20.901
While the kitchen struggles

31:20.901 --> 31:21.968
To push out food...

31:21.968 --> 31:24.001
Here you go.
Thank you, Celine.

31:24.001 --> 31:25.434
Customers who
ordered the crepes

31:25.434 --> 31:27.401
Are thrilled with what
they are receiving.

31:27.401 --> 31:29.334
It looks fabulous!

31:29.334 --> 31:30.672
Absolutely awesome.

31:30.672 --> 31:31.001
Absolutely awesome.

31:31.001 --> 31:32.468
As for the old menu,

31:32.468 --> 31:33.701
It's disappointment.

31:35.634 --> 31:37.668
After disappointment.

31:37.668 --> 31:38.734
Oh, I'm so sorry.

31:38.734 --> 31:40.668
The artichoke,
it's droopy.

31:40.668 --> 31:42.234
It doesn't have
any flavor.

31:42.234 --> 31:44.268
Did you want anything else
instead, or just, uh...

31:44.268 --> 31:45.634
No, we'll just go
to the main course.

31:45.634 --> 31:47.868
Thank you so much.

31:47.868 --> 31:49.634
Two hot artichokes
coming back.

31:49.634 --> 31:51.634
No good?
Why not? Too salty or...

31:51.634 --> 31:54.101
They said they're old,
and they don't like it.

31:54.101 --> 31:55.901
It's disheartening to see
how much food

31:55.901 --> 31:57.534
was wasted tonight.

31:57.534 --> 31:59.801
I literally feel like
we are, you know,

31:59.801 --> 32:00.672
back to square one.

32:00.672 --> 32:01.934
back to square one.

32:01.934 --> 32:04.168
So...We just get
a little bit organized.

32:04.168 --> 32:06.568
I wanna see you
step up to the plate, yeah?

32:06.568 --> 32:08.034
But they don't
listen to me.

32:08.034 --> 32:10.101
Last night, you were
the only voice of reason

32:10.101 --> 32:11.368
I could actually understand.

32:11.368 --> 32:12.468
So they gotta listen!

32:12.468 --> 32:15.368
Got it.
You understand?

32:15.368 --> 32:17.068
Communication's
of the essence, guys.

32:17.068 --> 32:20.168
How many minutes out
are we on table 19?

32:20.168 --> 32:21.801
Ooh!

32:21.801 --> 32:23.501
In the kitchen, chef Martin

32:23.501 --> 32:25.301
Continues to ignore Celine.

32:25.301 --> 32:26.468
Flip that baby.

32:26.468 --> 32:27.934
But in the dining room,

32:27.934 --> 32:29.434
Alex is a new man.

32:29.434 --> 32:30.672
It's pretty darn good, huh?

32:30.672 --> 32:30.901
It's pretty darn good, huh?

32:30.901 --> 32:32.368
I'm gettin'
my routine here.

32:32.368 --> 32:34.101
He's energetic
and working hard

32:34.101 --> 32:36.568
To satisfy customers
any way he can.

32:36.568 --> 32:38.068
Ham and cheese.

32:38.068 --> 32:39.634
Including making delicious,

32:39.634 --> 32:41.068
Satisfying crepes.

32:41.068 --> 32:42.101
So yummy.

32:42.101 --> 32:43.268
Isn't it, like,
so good?

32:43.268 --> 32:44.668
I love the dill.

32:44.668 --> 32:46.034
Okay, well,
thank you gentlemen.

32:46.034 --> 32:47.701
Bye-bye.
Thank you very much.

32:51.368 --> 32:52.568
Let's be honest.

32:52.568 --> 32:54.301
We all know
where the problem is.

32:54.301 --> 32:55.568
Celine...

32:55.568 --> 32:58.201
The head chef is not
acting as the head chef

32:58.201 --> 33:00.034
and watching the food
come out properly.

33:00.034 --> 33:00.672
And for every crap dish
they send out...

33:00.672 --> 33:03.368
And for every crap dish
they send out...

33:03.368 --> 33:06.701
It's closing
that door quicker.

33:06.701 --> 33:08.234
I have seen
what you have seen.

33:08.234 --> 33:10.734
I have seen some stuff
which I don't like.

33:10.734 --> 33:12.201
They need a leader.

33:12.201 --> 33:13.334
They need a better leader.

33:13.334 --> 33:14.468
You're right!

33:14.468 --> 33:16.034
They need that.

33:16.034 --> 33:18.901
Without that,
they can't respect us.

33:18.901 --> 33:20.501
That's the engine room
in there.

33:20.501 --> 33:22.434
If that's not firing
on all cylinders,

33:22.434 --> 33:24.001
we're screwed.

33:25.901 --> 33:27.601
Understand...
What I've said?

33:27.601 --> 33:28.868
Absolutely.

33:28.868 --> 33:30.534
Tomorrow, I want
each and every one of you

33:30.534 --> 33:30.672
to get ready for
some major changes.

33:30.672 --> 33:34.068
to get ready for
some major changes.

33:35.834 --> 33:37.201
Coming up...

33:37.201 --> 33:39.234
You'll be the first customers
of the new La Frite.

33:39.234 --> 33:41.001
It's the biggest night
in the last 30 years

33:41.001 --> 33:42.301
For La Frite.

33:42.301 --> 33:44.434
I need you to get
a grip of the kitchen.

33:44.434 --> 33:46.401
Can this struggling
kitchen staff...

33:46.401 --> 33:47.401
Martin!

33:47.401 --> 33:48.534
You need to talk!

33:48.534 --> 33:49.634
Finally get it together?

33:49.634 --> 33:51.468
None of my tables
have their entrees.

33:51.468 --> 33:53.168
Or will they fail miserably

33:53.168 --> 33:55.334
And crush the dream
of a family?

33:55.334 --> 33:56.834
I'm walkin' out now!

33:56.834 --> 33:58.168
It hurts me so much

33:58.168 --> 33:59.434
To watch any table
walk out of here

33:59.434 --> 34:00.672
without even getting
served their food.

34:00.672 --> 34:00.934
without even getting
served their food.

34:09.874 --> 34:12.774
With the family now
all on the same page,

34:12.774 --> 34:15.641
Chef Ramsey moves ahead
with the 40-year-old facelift

34:15.641 --> 34:16.741
of La Frite.

34:19.841 --> 34:21.807
- Good morning!
- Good morning.

34:21.807 --> 34:24.707
Are you ready to witness
the new La Frite?

34:24.707 --> 34:25.874
Let's do it!

34:25.874 --> 34:28.141
Celine, ladies first.
Off you go.

34:28.141 --> 34:31.307
Oh, my God.
Oh, my gosh.

34:34.007 --> 34:35.410
God, it's beautiful.

34:35.410 --> 34:36.141
God, it's beautiful.

34:36.141 --> 34:37.207
Oh, it's different.

34:37.207 --> 34:38.474
Wow. Look at it!

34:38.474 --> 34:40.674
Where's my yellow?

34:40.674 --> 34:42.107
Gone is the yellow.

34:42.107 --> 34:44.407
I can't believe how bright.

34:44.407 --> 34:46.274
How much does that blue
pop out now?

34:46.274 --> 34:47.674
It's beautiful.

34:47.674 --> 34:48.941
Father, the awning's gone.

34:48.941 --> 34:50.841
My bar American is gone.

34:50.841 --> 34:52.174
The bar can be a bar now.

34:52.174 --> 34:53.941
It's not smothered with
a hideous awning.

34:53.941 --> 34:57.507
We've opened it up and it's got
that modern French bistro vibe.

34:57.507 --> 34:59.974
We've got custom artwork
on the wall--look at it.

34:59.974 --> 35:01.007
Wow.

35:01.007 --> 35:02.141
Oh, my God!

35:02.141 --> 35:03.874
Oh! It's beautiful.

35:05.674 --> 35:07.141
Customer, oh, my gosh.

35:07.141 --> 35:08.507
They're going to say...

35:14.874 --> 35:16.041
What do you think?

35:16.041 --> 35:17.407
What do you think?
Can you see the change?

35:17.407 --> 35:19.074
It's awesome.
I think it's just beautiful.

35:20.807 --> 35:22.007
Look at the two of you.

35:22.007 --> 35:23.274
I think it's a new beginning.

35:23.274 --> 35:24.641
We're turning that page
from the '70s

35:24.641 --> 35:25.907
to the future.

35:27.307 --> 35:29.041
This restaurant
needs to be

35:29.041 --> 35:31.607
cool, hip, and trendy
to compete.

35:31.607 --> 35:33.741
So the menu needs
to reflect that.

35:33.741 --> 35:35.107
Wow, cut down!

35:35.107 --> 35:35.410
It's a classic,
modern bistro take.

35:35.410 --> 35:38.307
It's a classic,
modern bistro take.

35:38.307 --> 35:39.641
Good.

35:39.641 --> 35:41.741
Yes.

35:41.741 --> 35:44.074
Okay, tonight,
we are relaunching La Frite.

35:44.074 --> 35:45.007
Yes.
New restaurant,
new menu.

35:45.007 --> 35:46.007
More importantly,

35:46.007 --> 35:47.241
a united family

35:47.241 --> 35:49.607
with a brand-new attitude

35:49.607 --> 35:51.307
to put this restaurant
on the map.

35:51.307 --> 35:52.974
You ready?
Yeah.

35:52.974 --> 35:56.174
Here's one of the most
important worries on my mind.

35:56.174 --> 35:57.707
Last night, there was
a glaring problem.

35:57.707 --> 36:00.207
Your kitchen was nowhere
near strong enough

36:00.207 --> 36:01.541
to relaunch
this restaurant.

36:01.541 --> 36:03.141
So I made a few phone calls

36:03.141 --> 36:05.107
and I found
a secret weapon.

36:05.107 --> 36:05.410
Please welcome...

36:05.410 --> 36:06.707
Please welcome...

36:06.707 --> 36:07.907
Chef Chuy.

36:07.907 --> 36:09.007
Come here, buddy!

36:09.007 --> 36:10.207
Good to see you.
Hi.

36:10.207 --> 36:12.574
Good to see you, buddy.
Nice to meet you.

36:12.574 --> 36:14.341
Yeah, I'm happy to be
here with you guys.
Okay.

36:14.341 --> 36:16.674
This man has over
15 years of experience

36:16.674 --> 36:18.174
in French bistros.

36:18.174 --> 36:20.074
Whilst I'm here,
I wanted him

36:20.074 --> 36:22.507
to be over every little
detail in that kitchen,

36:22.507 --> 36:23.807
teaching your brigade

36:23.807 --> 36:25.374
this menu,

36:25.374 --> 36:27.241
to make sure
we haven't got issues

36:27.241 --> 36:29.141
you got another voice.
thank you.

36:29.141 --> 36:30.207
Okay, let's go.

36:30.207 --> 36:32.207
We got some prep to do.

36:32.207 --> 36:33.907
While Chef Chuy trains Martin

36:33.907 --> 36:34.874
And the kitchen staff...

36:37.341 --> 36:39.841
Chef Ramsay reveals
the stunning new menu

36:39.841 --> 36:41.141
to the family.

36:41.141 --> 36:42.774
Okay, the new menu
at La Frite.

36:42.774 --> 36:44.041
It's gorgeous.

36:44.041 --> 36:45.674
It smells good
in here already.

36:45.674 --> 36:47.274
Let's have a little run-through
of the menu from the top.

36:47.274 --> 36:49.441
Something classic and French.
Escargot.

36:49.441 --> 36:51.807
French snails with puff pastry
croutons in there.

36:51.807 --> 36:52.941
Minced filet mignon.

36:52.941 --> 36:54.374
Yeah? Classic garnish.

36:54.374 --> 36:55.707
Finished with a little
quail egg on the top.

36:55.707 --> 36:57.407
The entrees.

36:57.407 --> 36:58.407
Coq au vin.

36:58.407 --> 36:59.641
Braised chicken and red wine,

36:59.641 --> 37:01.174
Swiss chard, and turnips.

37:01.174 --> 37:02.441
The Jarret d'agneau.

37:02.441 --> 37:03.774
Braised lamb shank,
truffle polenta,

37:03.774 --> 37:05.374
and Brussels sprouts.

37:05.374 --> 37:05.410
A Frenchman's dream.

37:05.410 --> 37:06.774
A Frenchman's dream.

37:06.774 --> 37:08.241
It's good.
I-I love it.

37:08.241 --> 37:09.507
It's gorgeous.

37:09.507 --> 37:11.274
I-I'm just flabbergasted.

37:11.274 --> 37:12.874
I mean, it's beautiful.

37:12.874 --> 37:13.941
This is how it should be.

37:13.941 --> 37:14.974
This is exciting.

37:14.974 --> 37:16.707
It's a--a great menu.

37:16.707 --> 37:18.341
And, you know,
I can't wait to see

37:18.341 --> 37:19.707
excellent food
coming out of the kitchen.

37:19.707 --> 37:21.707
Oh, my God.
I mean, they're all amazing.

37:21.707 --> 37:24.241
It's good, that's all--
that's all I know.

37:26.541 --> 37:28.341
After almost 40 years
without a change,

37:28.341 --> 37:29.707
It's relaunch night
at La Frite.

37:29.707 --> 37:31.374
How are you?
Good.

37:31.374 --> 37:34.041
You'll be the first customers
of the new La Frite.

37:34.041 --> 37:35.410
And time for chef Martin
to be tested.

37:35.410 --> 37:35.741
And time for chef Martin
to be tested.

37:35.741 --> 37:37.107
Okay, great.
You all set?

37:37.107 --> 37:38.607
Yeah.
Good.

37:38.607 --> 37:40.507
Chef Chuy will be there
to support him

37:40.507 --> 37:42.107
And oversee
the crepe station.

37:44.407 --> 37:45.507
The old La Frite is gone.

37:45.507 --> 37:46.474
Let's go.

37:46.474 --> 37:47.607
I'm a little nervous because,

37:47.607 --> 37:49.341
after 20 years
cooking the same food

37:49.341 --> 37:51.174
almost every day, you know,

37:51.174 --> 37:52.974
the new menu
is totally different.

37:52.974 --> 37:54.141
What do we think?

37:54.141 --> 37:55.674
I'll have the onion soup
to start.

37:55.674 --> 37:57.174
I'll have
the braised lamb shank.

37:57.174 --> 37:58.841
I'll have the tuna
nicoise salad

37:58.841 --> 38:00.541
with a mushroom crepe.

38:00.541 --> 38:01.874
Martin, order in.

38:01.874 --> 38:03.541
Escargot, table two!
Ready to go!

38:03.541 --> 38:05.241
It's 30 minutes into service...

38:05.241 --> 38:05.410
All right, soup du jour.

38:05.410 --> 38:07.207
All right, soup du jour.

38:07.207 --> 38:09.074
And appetizers are not only
leaving the kitchen quickly...

38:10.741 --> 38:12.541
They are a hit
with customers.

38:12.541 --> 38:13.774
That is great.

38:13.774 --> 38:15.107
But back in the kitchen...

38:15.107 --> 38:17.807
Martin, two soup du jours
and a cordon bleu crepe.

38:17.807 --> 38:19.107
Martin...

38:19.107 --> 38:20.107
Trouble is brewing

38:20.107 --> 38:21.507
As a frustrated Celine...

38:21.507 --> 38:23.307
How's my cordon bleu crepe?

38:23.307 --> 38:25.841
Tries to get answers
from Martin.

38:25.841 --> 38:27.007
Martin!
Communicate, please!

38:27.007 --> 38:28.474
Martin!

38:30.374 --> 38:31.307
Martin!

38:31.307 --> 38:32.741
I hear you, sir!
Talk to me!

38:32.741 --> 38:35.410
I need you to start
giving an answer to Celine.

38:35.410 --> 38:35.607
I need you to start
giving an answer to Celine.

38:35.607 --> 38:37.241
You need to talk!

38:38.874 --> 38:40.074
While an organized Celine

38:40.074 --> 38:41.907
Tries to expedite,

38:41.907 --> 38:43.541
Martin continues
to ignore.

38:46.241 --> 38:48.674
And almost nothing
is leaving the kitchen.

38:52.607 --> 38:54.607
Absolutely.
I'll bring it right away.

38:56.341 --> 38:57.674
Do we have table three?

38:57.674 --> 38:59.041
If they--they're
doing it right now.

38:59.041 --> 39:00.641
They're doing it right now.
Uh-huh, perfect.

39:02.374 --> 39:03.641
How long for this,
do you think?

39:03.641 --> 39:04.974
'cause otherwise, they said
they will cancel it.

39:06.441 --> 39:07.507
It's about
five more minutes.

39:07.507 --> 39:08.474
Five more minutes.
Uh, yeah.

39:08.474 --> 39:10.007
Five minutes?

39:10.007 --> 39:12.407
I have five tables,
all waiting

39:12.407 --> 39:13.807
an hour and a half
for their entrees.

39:13.807 --> 39:16.041
And I cannot do anything.

39:20.774 --> 39:23.674
Don't run that 20.
They're walking out now.

39:23.674 --> 39:25.641
20's walking out now.

39:25.641 --> 39:27.474
Basically,
it hurts me so much

39:27.474 --> 39:29.174
to watch any table
walk out of here

39:29.174 --> 39:30.674
without even getting
served their food.

39:30.674 --> 39:32.307
Just completely
out of control.

39:32.307 --> 39:34.441
Serious, man?

39:42.440 --> 39:43.740
It's relaunch night
at La Frite,

39:43.740 --> 39:45.240
and after a 90-minute wait...

39:49.440 --> 39:50.907
The first table
has walked out.

39:50.907 --> 39:51.907
Wow.

39:51.907 --> 39:52.874
Unbelievable.

39:55.174 --> 39:56.974
Serious, man?

39:56.974 --> 39:58.107
What's wrong?

39:58.107 --> 39:59.274
None of my tables have
their  entrees,

39:59.274 --> 40:00.641
And one of 'em walked out,
they're done!

40:00.641 --> 40:02.774
Oh,.

40:02.774 --> 40:04.841
Servers, in the dining room.

40:04.841 --> 40:06.974
Everybody else, shut
the  up for 30 seconds.

40:06.974 --> 40:08.808
This is really important.

40:08.808 --> 40:10.211
Celine, I need you

40:10.211 --> 40:10.341
Celine, I need you

40:10.341 --> 40:11.408
to get a grip
of the kitchen.

40:11.408 --> 40:13.499
I need you to delegate,
please?

40:16.708 --> 40:18.008
Tell him, that, yeah?

40:18.008 --> 40:19.641
Chuy, please take control
of the kitchen.

40:19.641 --> 40:20.608
Yes, Ma'am.

40:20.608 --> 40:22.508
Thank you.

40:24.341 --> 40:26.674
Let's go, guys!
We should be able to do this!

40:26.674 --> 40:29.307
Come on!
How's table eight working?

40:29.307 --> 40:30.907
I need like
four or five minutes for that.

40:30.907 --> 40:32.307
Yep, perfect.

40:32.307 --> 40:33.741
What I liked
about Chef Chuy is,

40:33.741 --> 40:34.974
when I said something to him,
he would acknowledge me

40:34.974 --> 40:35.974
and say, "okay."

40:35.974 --> 40:37.141
and that's how it should be.

40:37.141 --> 40:38.774
Okay, that's the poulet.

40:38.774 --> 40:40.211
Here, this.
Poulet champignon.

40:40.211 --> 40:40.774
Here, this.
Poulet champignon.

40:40.774 --> 40:42.341
Yay!

40:42.341 --> 40:43.907
With Celine and Chef Chuy

40:43.907 --> 40:45.641
Now working
in complete harmony.

40:45.641 --> 40:47.174
We're running
table seven, please.

40:47.174 --> 40:49.107
Thank you.
Thank you.

40:49.107 --> 40:50.974
Entrees are flying
out of the kitchen...

40:50.974 --> 40:53.441
Oh, finally.
Yes. Yes!
Oh, look at that.

40:53.441 --> 40:54.907
And La Frite's relaunch...

40:54.907 --> 40:56.274
It melts in your mouth.

40:56.274 --> 40:57.707
It was worth the wait.

40:57.707 --> 40:59.874
Finishes on a positive note.

40:59.874 --> 41:01.007
I have
no other table, huh?

41:01.007 --> 41:02.441
I'm finished.

41:02.441 --> 41:03.607
Take a break.
Thank you, guys.

41:03.607 --> 41:05.207
Great job, guys.

41:12.841 --> 41:15.841
Right, um, first of all,

41:15.841 --> 41:17.207
let me make something
really clear.

41:17.207 --> 41:19.441
You will not...

41:19.441 --> 41:21.407
Be able to move forward

41:21.407 --> 41:23.041
unless you make

41:23.041 --> 41:25.074
major changes
in that kitchen.

41:25.074 --> 41:26.341
I don't know
what would have happened

41:26.341 --> 41:27.641
to this restaurant tonight
if Chef Chuy wasn't there,

41:27.641 --> 41:28.607
let me tell you that.

41:28.607 --> 41:29.574
But Chef Chuy

41:29.574 --> 41:30.941
can't do it alone.

41:30.941 --> 41:32.174
It's true.

41:32.174 --> 41:34.474
The family's united.
Now...

41:34.474 --> 41:37.274
You as a family,
have to fix the kitchen.

41:37.274 --> 41:38.374
Yep.

41:38.374 --> 41:39.507
Gordon made us realize

41:39.507 --> 41:40.211
that we need
to work together

41:40.211 --> 41:41.141
that we need
to work together

41:41.141 --> 41:43.474
on making changes,
you know, building a team

41:43.474 --> 41:45.707
that's gonna continue
getting this restaurant

41:45.707 --> 41:47.674
to--to the next level.

41:47.674 --> 41:50.041
And, Andre,
when you first came to me,

41:50.041 --> 41:51.407
you were worried
about these two.

41:51.407 --> 41:53.307
I wanted them together.

41:53.307 --> 41:54.674
They can work together.

41:54.674 --> 41:56.107
And they--
they proved it.

41:56.107 --> 41:59.174
Not to me, but to you.

41:59.174 --> 42:01.141
They are fine.

42:01.141 --> 42:03.074
And they just want
to make you proud.

42:03.074 --> 42:04.241
I'm proud of them.

42:06.741 --> 42:08.274
This has been a really,
really incredible experience.

42:08.274 --> 42:10.007
It's great to have
made it through

42:10.007 --> 42:10.211
and made it through
a stronger person

42:10.211 --> 42:11.174
and made it through
a stronger person

42:11.174 --> 42:12.807
and a stronger family and--

42:12.807 --> 42:14.574
and a stronger restaurant
as a whole.

42:14.574 --> 42:16.641
Thank you.
Take care.

42:16.641 --> 42:18.274
Take care.
It was--
you were great.

42:18.274 --> 42:19.641
No more crepe
in a casserole.

42:19.641 --> 42:21.141
No. Promise.

42:21.141 --> 42:22.274
Thank you so much.

42:22.274 --> 42:23.241
Good night.

42:25.041 --> 42:27.974
This week, we definitely,
definitely fixed the family.

42:27.974 --> 42:30.107
But I'm not too sure we
actually fixed the restaurant.

42:30.107 --> 42:31.874
We've given them all the tools,
but it's up to them

42:31.874 --> 42:34.007
to make the tough decisions.

42:34.007 --> 42:36.207
Sacre bleu.

42:39.220 --> 42:40.211
In the days that followed,

42:40.211 --> 42:41.354
In the days that followed,

42:41.354 --> 42:43.154
Chef Chuy
was brought in full time

42:43.154 --> 42:45.054
as the new executive chef.

42:45.054 --> 42:46.520
Just put it out.
Put it out.

42:46.520 --> 42:49.187
Cordon bleu crepes.
Thank you very much, Chuy.

42:49.187 --> 42:51.854
And is continuing to build
a strong team in the kitchen.

42:51.854 --> 42:53.720
It's okay.
They'll get crispy.

42:53.720 --> 42:55.254
Bon appetit.
Enjoy.

42:55.254 --> 42:57.620
Alex and Celine
are working hard

42:57.620 --> 42:59.120
To continue
the family legacy.

42:59.120 --> 43:01.054
So I need a frisee salad

43:01.054 --> 43:02.287
and the poulet, pomme.

43:02.287 --> 43:03.887
But more importantly,

43:03.887 --> 43:05.587
they are doing it together.

43:05.587 --> 43:07.053
Bye, Celina.
Bye.

43:07.053 --> 43:09.330
Mwah.
I'll see you soon.
See you later.
