WEBVTT

00:01.830 --> 00:02.980
every girl I've been with,

00:02.990 --> 00:04.362
I knew why we were gonna break up

00:04.363 --> 00:05.900
two weeks before we started dating.

00:05.910 --> 00:07.580
With janet,I don't know.

00:07.590 --> 00:08.711
You have a wicked blind spot when

00:08.712 --> 00:09.900
it comes to the men in your life,

00:09.910 --> 00:12.010
right now you can't see what
a slimeball big cat can be.

00:12.020 --> 00:14.170
Didn't you just get your
very first boyfriend?

00:14.180 --> 00:15.160
I think I should go.

00:15.170 --> 00:16.290
I think you should,too.

00:16.300 --> 00:17.490
I don't wanna be your friend.

00:18.170 --> 00:20.770
Gavin goddard
- that is sam's father's name.

00:20.780 --> 00:22.910
Nick garrett,this is gavin goddard.

00:22.920 --> 00:24.350
You didn't tell him,did ya?

00:24.360 --> 00:25.070
Nick.

00:25.080 --> 00:25.850
Eddie.

00:25.860 --> 00:28.220
nick deserves to
know,hannah,that you and-

00:28.230 --> 00:29.620
no.

00:58.760 --> 01:01.350
I think I drank 112 beers last night.

01:01.360 --> 01:02.500
Seriously.

01:06.660 --> 01:08.120
The smell of your,uh,

01:08.480 --> 01:10.106
cinnamon raisin toast makes me

01:10.107 --> 01:11.840
almost wanna puke my guts out.

01:14.490 --> 01:15.940
You got the sports?

01:21.960 --> 01:23.550
oh,morning.

01:24.120 --> 01:26.020
Oh,whose toast?

01:26.030 --> 01:26.830
You can have it.

01:26.840 --> 01:28.810
Thanks. Hey,you got the sports?

01:29.210 --> 01:30.390
Here.

01:30.750 --> 01:32.170
Hey,you got the,uh,business?

01:32.180 --> 01:33.530
I am serious.

01:33.540 --> 01:35.070
It's just the greatest thing ever.

01:35.390 --> 01:37.410
Owen,tell him about the spelling bee.

01:37.420 --> 01:38.990
It's just the greatest thing ever.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.921
Made even greater this year by the fact

01:40.922 --> 01:43.040
that knights ridge's
own james kornduffer

01:43.050 --> 01:45.000
is a dark horse favorite
in the "ten and under. "

01:45.010 --> 01:45.730
Who?

01:45.740 --> 01:46.799
"Jimmy crack" kornduffer,

01:46.800 --> 01:48.240
as they call him on the streets.

01:48.250 --> 01:51.110
Jimmy crack kornduffer,and i do care.

01:51.450 --> 01:52.890
- Movie section?
- Hey,you know what?

01:52.900 --> 01:54.278
We should have a viewing party

01:54.279 --> 01:55.840
for the semifinals on wednesday,

01:55.850 --> 01:57.290
with,uh. margaritas.

01:57.300 --> 01:58.180
And guacamole!

01:58.190 --> 01:59.240
Yes!

01:59.520 --> 02:00.770
What do you say,mr. Garrett?

02:01.240 --> 02:03.320
A viewing party for a spelling bee?

02:03.330 --> 02:04.570
It seems a little lame.

02:04.580 --> 02:06.050
You mean fantastic.

02:06.060 --> 02:10.400
Last year,jimmy crack
kornduffer came oh,so close.

02:10.690 --> 02:11.540
Mm,phlegm.

02:11.550 --> 02:12.430
What about phlegm?

02:12.440 --> 02:13.610
He forgot the "g" in "phlegm. "

02:13.620 --> 02:14.720
There's a "g" in "phlegm"?

02:14.730 --> 02:16.380
Are you reading the front page,robert?

02:21.840 --> 02:22.950
excuse me.

02:22.960 --> 02:24.190
Uh,tell 'em about the party.

02:24.730 --> 02:27.930
I think a viewing party is a great idea.

02:27.940 --> 02:29.890
This is a pretty big
deal for knights ridge.

02:29.900 --> 02:33.120
I'm not really interested
in watching a spelling bee.

02:34.650 --> 02:37.360
No,no,it's just,this is a bad time.

02:37.370 --> 02:38.500
I can'T.

02:38.510 --> 02:39.590
Not now.

02:40.100 --> 02:41.640
Of course I do.

02:42.460 --> 02:44.470
Yes. Okay.

02:44.980 --> 02:46.190
I love you.

02:56.600 --> 02:58.700
down sleeping bag,check.

02:58.910 --> 03:01.480
flashlight,check.

03:02.060 --> 03:03.800
lantern,check.

03:03.810 --> 03:05.230
hand sanitizer.

03:05.700 --> 03:08.340
yes,doodie,it's antibacterial.

03:08.350 --> 03:09.780
Come get it when you want.

03:11.240 --> 03:13.530
Big,germ-free sleepover in the works?

03:13.830 --> 03:16.158
Nah,I'm lending doodie my stuff for

03:16.159 --> 03:18.620
our class' father-son camping trip.

03:19.200 --> 03:21.140
And,uh,you
- you're not going?

03:21.690 --> 03:23.792
Nah,I'm kinda missing the one key

03:23.793 --> 03:26.530
ingredient for a
father-son camping trip.

03:27.370 --> 03:28.600
A tent.

03:28.610 --> 03:29.900
I have a tent.

03:30.220 --> 03:31.620
if you're interested in going.

03:31.630 --> 03:32.920
You mean,you'd take me?

03:32.930 --> 03:33.970
Yeah,if you want.

03:33.980 --> 03:35.290
Come on. It'll be fun.

03:35.830 --> 03:38.033
And I have been told
that my s'mores are the

03:38.034 --> 03:40.480
standard by which all
other s'mores are measured.

03:42.690 --> 03:43.550
Call me later.

03:43.560 --> 03:44.520
I will.

03:50.400 --> 03:51.520
We gotta talk,brophus.

03:51.980 --> 03:52.780
What is it?

03:53.540 --> 03:56.320
That phone call that
aubrey got a-at breakfast.

03:56.770 --> 03:58.390
I overheard something.

03:58.970 --> 04:00.180
nick?

04:01.450 --> 04:04.520
How much longer you figure
owen will be bunking here?

04:05.590 --> 04:06.670
I love the kid.

04:06.680 --> 04:09.430
I feel his pain,but he has
been living here for months.

04:09.440 --> 04:10.980
It is starting to get crowded.

04:10.990 --> 04:12.140
We can't just kick him out.

04:12.150 --> 04:13.010
I know that.

04:13.020 --> 04:15.640
Whoever aubrey was talking
to,she was acting all secretive.

04:15.650 --> 04:17.360
All,"I can't talk right now. "

04:17.370 --> 04:19.380
Maybe you should suggest
that he find himself a place.

04:19.390 --> 04:21.820
They got those apartments in town
- the ones above the apothecary.

04:21.829 --> 04:23.690
His marriage just broke up,dad.

04:23.700 --> 04:24.960
She said,"I love you. "

04:25.760 --> 04:27.080
She said,"I love you"?

04:27.960 --> 04:28.690
To who?

04:28.700 --> 04:29.570
I don't know.

04:29.580 --> 04:31.460
But after the whole hannah thing,I.

04:31.900 --> 04:32.910
you're fragile.

04:32.920 --> 04:34.940
I
- I just don't wanna see you get hurt again.

04:34.950 --> 04:35.610
Nick.

04:35.620 --> 04:39.450
I will talk to owen,and I will
talk to aubrey,too,okay,ronnie?

04:39.970 --> 04:41.170
Dad?

05:01.720 --> 05:03.480
Little jimmy crack kornduffer?

05:03.490 --> 05:04.810
Cromlech.

05:04.820 --> 05:07.470
C-
r-o-m-I-e-c-H.

05:07.480 --> 05:09.640
Oh,that kid lives
around the block from me.

05:09.650 --> 05:11.520
I used to babysit for hibrother allen,

05:11.800 --> 05:13.990
who,by the way,is dumber
than a box of rocks.

05:14.610 --> 05:16.220
in search of a win.

05:16.230 --> 05:18.181
And horseshoes in the olympics?

05:18.182 --> 05:19.880
We'll meet a duxbury man.

05:19.890 --> 05:21.060
you want some?

05:30.410 --> 05:32.263
I wasn't sure if you were bivouacking in

05:32.264 --> 05:34.440
the living room or
planning on coming to bed.

05:36.140 --> 05:38.000
No,this camping trip
just got me thinking.

05:38.820 --> 05:40.030
about sam?

05:43.800 --> 05:45.720
Are you sure you're okay going on it?

05:46.180 --> 05:48.110
You know,'cause it's
a father-son thing?

05:48.710 --> 05:49.970
I'm more than okay.

05:50.860 --> 05:52.590
I'm really looking forward to it.

05:52.880 --> 05:55.860
Good,'cause I think sam is,too.

05:58.370 --> 06:00.060
And just being here as much as I am,

06:01.070 --> 06:02.880
I'm really getting to know sam.

06:03.840 --> 06:05.300
care about him.

06:05.820 --> 06:07.110
That's great.

06:08.310 --> 06:14.060
which is why,after we're
married,I want to adopt sam.

06:18.620 --> 06:19.880
Wow,that'S.

06:19.890 --> 06:20.870
a lot.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.130
I know.

06:22.740 --> 06:25.200
I'm not trying to take anything
away from gavin goddard.

06:25.570 --> 06:28.400
Gavin lives in new york and
sees sam once or twice a year.

06:29.250 --> 06:29.890
I'm here.

06:29.900 --> 06:31.880
I'm a part of sam's life
in the ridge every day.

06:31.890 --> 06:34.400
I know,but that's gonna be the
case whether you adopt him or not.

06:34.930 --> 06:39.510
True,but the boy needs a real father.

06:41.260 --> 06:42.670
He does.

06:44.970 --> 06:46.990
I'm not looking for you to
give me an answer tonight.

06:48.020 --> 06:49.050
I'm just.

06:49.060 --> 06:50.710
asking you to think about it.

06:52.860 --> 06:53.860
Okay.

06:54.310 --> 06:55.610
I will.

06:56.120 --> 06:57.610

Who was that call from?

07:17.890 --> 07:19.180
That call?

07:19.190 --> 07:19.990
What call?

07:20.000 --> 07:21.600
Yesterday morning at breakfast.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.060
You got a phone call.

07:23.070 --> 07:24.470
Oh,the phone call.

07:24.480 --> 07:25.280
Yeah.

07:25.290 --> 07:26.790
That was from my computer guy.

07:28.730 --> 07:29.970
Your computer guy?

07:29.980 --> 07:32.330
My computer guy zed.

07:35.240 --> 07:36.200
Zed?

07:37.150 --> 07:39.510
Why do you love zed?

07:39.870 --> 07:41.010
What?

07:41.020 --> 07:42.820
Ronnie overheard your conversation.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.900
You said"I love you. "

07:45.440 --> 07:46.370
why?

07:46.380 --> 07:49.201
Zed recovered some 200
pages of short fiction

07:49.202 --> 07:51.900
from my hard drive
that I thought I'd lost.

07:52.210 --> 07:54.710
So I told him I loved him,as in.

07:54.720 --> 07:58.111
"I love you,zed,for recovering
some 200 pages of short

07:58.112 --> 08:01.440
fiction from my hard drive
that I thought I'd lost. "

08:02.520 --> 08:03.740
Right.

08:04.510 --> 08:05.990
That's my thing.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.030
I say "I love you" when
I'm pleased with someone.

08:09.840 --> 08:11.290
Why,just an hour ago,

08:11.400 --> 08:13.930
I told murph that I loved him
for having the havarti cheese that

08:13.940 --> 08:16.880
is on this very sandwich
that we are about to share.

08:17.590 --> 08:18.800
I got you.

08:20.030 --> 08:20.770
Sorry.

08:21.140 --> 08:22.630
You should be.

08:24.860 --> 08:28.150
We've been hanging
out for,what,six weeks?

08:28.780 --> 08:30.810
I'not seeing anyone else.

08:31.360 --> 08:36.650
And if,uh,you are,now would
be a good time to tell me.

08:37.230 --> 08:38.600
I'm not.

08:39.740 --> 08:41.030
Good.

08:41.669 --> 08:43.880
Mmm,havarti.

08:44.770 --> 08:46.510
I love you,too,murph.

08:48.540 --> 08:51.630
Sully and his crew didn't just
miss the bull's-eye last night-

08:51.640 --> 08:53.210
they missed the entire wall,

08:53.220 --> 08:56.290
which takes a certain amount
of skill in and of itself.

08:57.040 --> 08:59.110
Yeah,that tap's been
finicky for a while now.

09:00.520 --> 09:02.600
All right,what's going on?

09:02.610 --> 09:03.840
Talk to rooster.

09:05.650 --> 09:06.550
Girl stuff.

09:06.560 --> 09:08.960
You know,the kind of thing
I'd go to hannah with.

09:09.320 --> 09:11.380
if we were talking,but we are not.

09:11.390 --> 09:12.760
Well,I'm here for ya.

09:12.770 --> 09:14.250
I have a feminine side.

09:14.260 --> 09:16.680
I use a ridiculous amount
of hair care products,

09:16.690 --> 09:19.440
and I've been known to enjoy
ma a drew barrymore film.

09:21.340 --> 09:22.180
Okay.

09:22.590 --> 09:23.950
It's about eddie.

09:24.710 --> 09:27.040
about. our sex life.

09:27.540 --> 09:28.890
or lack thereof.

09:29.820 --> 09:33.180
Have you at least rounded
any significant bases?

09:33.510 --> 09:37.000
Lots of infield
singles,but that's about it.

09:37.010 --> 09:40.830
If one of us doesn't swing for
the fences soon,we're gonna end up.

09:41.160 --> 09:42.250
friends.

09:42.260 --> 09:43.530
Yeah,that would suck.

09:44.780 --> 09:46.110
I don't know what to do.

09:46.120 --> 09:48.080
What you need to do
is have sex with him.

09:49.530 --> 09:50.920
It's not that easy.

09:50.930 --> 09:51.990
Why not?

09:52.000 --> 09:55.380
Because I'M.scared.

09:55.890 --> 09:58.480
I'm scared of getting
naked in front of him.

09:59.610 --> 10:01.740
I know it's stupid,but look at me.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.440
I'm not exactly kate moss.

10:14.980 --> 10:16.540
one hawaiian,extra cheese?

10:17.330 --> 10:18.270
Uh,how much do I owe you?

10:18.280 --> 10:19.490
It's $14.25.

10:20.010 --> 10:22.300
So this is the kornduffer house,right?

10:22.310 --> 10:23.070
Yeah.

10:23.500 --> 10:25.660
As in jimmy crack kornduffer?

10:25.920 --> 10:26.790
Yep.

10:26.800 --> 10:28.320
This is where the great man lives.

10:28.660 --> 10:30.380
Are you related to him?

10:30.390 --> 10:32.100
I am. I am his brother-

10:32.360 --> 10:34.700
his older brother,the
one who can't spell.

10:35.530 --> 10:38.080
and who obviously can't
count either. Sorry.

10:38.090 --> 10:40.840
So how come you're not at
the reege-bee,cheerg him on?

10:41.250 --> 10:45.110
I- I leave that to my parents
and grandparents and aunts,

10:45.120 --> 10:48.000
uncles,teachers,the parish priest,

10:48.480 --> 10:50.180
the doctor who delivered him and the,

10:50.190 --> 10:52.550
uh,the guy who installed our cable
- he went,too.

10:53.220 --> 10:54.520
Resentment.

10:54.530 --> 10:55.220
Yeah.

10:55.230 --> 10:58.060
I,uh,I can't spell it,but,uh,I feel it.

10:59.360 --> 11:00.500
Okay.

11:01.160 --> 11:02.410
Uh,enjoy your pie.

11:02.790 --> 11:04.140
Later.

11:08.810 --> 11:10.846
Jimmy kornduffer's road to the regional

11:10.847 --> 11:12.830
began here at his elementary school.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.070
how's the new tv?

11:14.560 --> 11:15.760
Just.

11:16.090 --> 11:17.560
too.

11:17.910 --> 11:19.580
yummy for words.

11:20.160 --> 11:21.110
Phlegm.

11:21.120 --> 11:22.170
I'm sorry. That is incorrect.

11:22.180 --> 11:24.030
You came home early last night.

11:24.040 --> 11:25.700
What goes on with you and janet?

11:25.710 --> 11:28.820
Oh,it's all good,just taking it slow.

11:29.360 --> 11:30.600
How slow?

11:31.480 --> 11:32.910
Standing still.

11:33.510 --> 11:36.254
Please don't tell me it's
because you still subscribe

11:36.255 --> 11:39.150
to hugh hefner's adolescent
narrow definition of beauty.

11:39.540 --> 11:42.250
Well,his magazine I still subscribe to.

11:42.260 --> 11:44.620
His definition of bety
- not so much.

11:45.480 --> 11:46.970
I think janet's beautiful.

11:46.980 --> 11:48.890
So why the vow of celibacy?

11:50.000 --> 11:51.680
Well,you know me,phys.

11:53.660 --> 11:56.390
when I sleep with a girl,the
first thing I wanna do is bail.

11:56.890 --> 11:58.855
I- I try to get out of the house and out

11:58.856 --> 12:00.960
of the relationship as
soon as possible,and.

12:02.230 --> 12:04.440
I really like janet a lo and I.

12:05.760 --> 12:07.640
I just don't wanna risk it.

12:15.320 --> 12:16.760
hey,sweetie.

12:17.830 --> 12:20.220
You already packing up
food supplies for the trip?

12:20.230 --> 12:24.780
Ray says the key to a successful
camping experience are the three p's-

12:25.100 --> 12:28.100
preparation,packing and pasta.

12:28.110 --> 12:29.370
Pasta?

12:30.800 --> 12:32.834
I think he just threw it in there 'cause

12:32.835 --> 12:34.970
he wanted three,and it started with "P."

12:39.440 --> 12:41.335
You know,sam,I wish
you'd have told me all

12:41.336 --> 12:43.450
these years about the
father-son camping trips.

12:43.460 --> 12:45.730
I could've called gavin.
He'd have taken you.

12:45.740 --> 12:48.531
Gavin once told me the
thing about camping that

12:48.532 --> 12:51.380
nobody realizes is that
you don't have to do it.

12:51.390 --> 12:53.750
Yeah,that sounds like gavin.

12:54.200 --> 12:55.550
I'm glad I'm going with ray.

12:55.860 --> 12:58.860
He's the guy everybody goes to
if they can't get their tent up

12:58.870 --> 13:01.520
or start the campfire or
open their can of beans.

13:01.910 --> 13:04.620
Yeah,he is that guy.

13:10.070 --> 13:11.540
tekka,huh?

13:12.280 --> 13:13.420
Yep.

13:13.430 --> 13:15.090
I coached him in peewee football.

13:15.100 --> 13:16.940
Always clever in the pocket.

13:17.380 --> 13:20.300
When I was laid up,after I
broke my ankle that winter?

13:20.620 --> 13:21.980
Eddie come around.

13:22.800 --> 13:24.610
He'd bring me magazines.

13:25.920 --> 13:27.640
and doughnuts.

13:28.010 --> 13:31.160
That sounds like him,taking care
of the man who pours his drinks.

13:31.170 --> 13:32.340
He's a good friend.

13:33.340 --> 13:35.810
He'll be a good friend to you
- a very good friend.

13:48.370 --> 13:49.704
Remember how on our second date,

13:49.705 --> 13:51.580
we talked about seeing
"on the waterfront"?

13:51.590 --> 13:52.390
I guess.

13:52.400 --> 13:53.560
You said you'd never seen it.

13:53.570 --> 13:54.540
I said you must.

13:54.550 --> 13:55.700
Brando as terry malloy.

13:55.710 --> 13:57.000
All-time genius.

13:57.010 --> 13:59.760
Anyway,we've been
dating for a while now.

14:00.120 --> 14:01.220
A while.

14:01.230 --> 14:03.180
And we still haven't seen it-

14:03.530 --> 14:04.910
"on the waterfront. "

14:05.240 --> 14:08.300
So I was thinking,we should hang
out at my place tomorrow night,

14:08.760 --> 14:12.260
and we should most definitely
watch "on the terfront. "

14:12.600 --> 14:15.120
Because if we don't
watch "on the waterfront,"

14:15.130 --> 14:17.620
we may run the risk
of never watching it.

14:18.630 --> 14:20.110
ever.

14:20.730 --> 14:21.740
Okay?

14:25.470 --> 14:26.650
Okay.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.300
"On the waterfront,"

14:29.670 --> 14:31.390
tomorrow night. Got it.

14:32.610 --> 14:33.880
Good.

14:41.350 --> 14:43.950
Ray wants to adopt sam
after you're married?

14:44.290 --> 14:45.090
That's right.

14:45.100 --> 14:47.600
Oh,by the way,congratulations
on your engagement.

14:47.610 --> 14:48.790
Thank you.

14:51.210 --> 14:54.580
basically,once we're married,we
just file some papers and that's it?

14:54.590 --> 14:55.720
Basically,yeah.

14:56.220 --> 14:59.660
Uh,once sam's biological father
officially forgoes his rights.

15:00.300 --> 15:03.580
But there's no father listed
on the birth certificate.

15:04.520 --> 15:05.840
I see.

15:06.630 --> 15:07.560
But,uh.

15:07.570 --> 15:09.040
assuming that you.

15:09.470 --> 15:11.460
do know who the father is.

15:11.950 --> 15:14.680
um,yeah,I just
- I haven't had the chance to put his name on it yet.

15:16.340 --> 15:17.360
He lives in new york.

15:17.370 --> 15:18.560
Is that a problem?

15:18.570 --> 15:19.530
No,not at all.

15:19.800 --> 15:21.450
Uh,but he would have to travel to

15:21.451 --> 15:23.400
massachusetts for the paternity test.

15:24.440 --> 15:25.980
We have to do a paternity test?

15:25.990 --> 15:30.170
Yes,yes,uh,to legally establish
that,uh,what's his name?

15:30.470 --> 15:31.680
Gavin goddard.

15:31.950 --> 15:35.880
To legally verify that mr. Goddard
is sam's biological father,that's it,

15:36.140 --> 15:39.430
and then,as long as mr. Goddard
is willing to give up his rights,

15:39.440 --> 15:41.140
ray can adopt sam.

15:42.110 --> 15:44.130
So you see,it's pretty straightforward.

15:50.520 --> 15:51.500
Well?

15:52.050 --> 15:53.310
Well,what?

15:53.650 --> 15:56.050
Well,did you ask aubrey
about the "I love you"?

15:56.500 --> 15:58.630
I did,if it's any of your business.

15:59.080 --> 16:00.120
Are you ready for this?

16:00.500 --> 16:02.100
It was her computer guy.

16:02.930 --> 16:03.880
Her computer guy?

16:03.890 --> 16:04.880
Yeah.

16:05.210 --> 16:08.060
He recovered some lost data,so
she was happy,said,"I love you. "

16:08.660 --> 16:10.210
It's her thing.

16:10.220 --> 16:11.480
Her thing?

16:11.900 --> 16:13.150
Yeah,her thing.

16:21.170 --> 16:25.020
oh,I heard jimmy crack
kornduffer speaks fluent french.

16:26.330 --> 16:28.490
How do you say "who cares" in french?

16:28.500 --> 16:32.180
Who wants little piggies snuggling
in their puff pastry blankies?

16:32.660 --> 16:34.250
Oh,man,I love you!

16:39.860 --> 16:40.880
it's me again.

16:40.890 --> 16:41.870
Hello.

16:42.180 --> 16:43.920
So has your brother been up yet?

16:44.580 --> 16:46.400
Uh,he made it through
the first two rounds.

16:46.410 --> 16:48.280
"Supercilious" and "narcissism. "

16:48.680 --> 16:50.540
Perfect words for him,methinks.

16:51.240 --> 16:52.730
I have a question for you.

16:53.210 --> 16:54.870
Are you rooting for him.

16:55.380 --> 16:56.610
to win?

16:57.270 --> 16:58.862
I've been living in the shadow of my

16:58.863 --> 17:01.030
9-year-old brother since
he was 4 and I was 12,

17:01.040 --> 17:03.870
and he recited cassius's
speech from shakespeare's

17:03.871 --> 17:07.200
"julius caesar" at the godfrey's
annual 4th of july picnic.

17:07.750 --> 17:11.569
So,no,lady,not only am i
not rooting for him to win,

17:11.859 --> 17:13.960
I'm rooting r him to wipe out.

17:14.270 --> 17:16.960
colossally,in front of
all of massachusetts,

17:16.961 --> 17:19.890
our family and the ghost
of william shakespeare.

17:20.230 --> 17:21.560
Yikes.

17:21.960 --> 17:23.512
My folks even gave him a handle that

17:23.513 --> 17:25.109
lends itself to a marquee nickname-

17:25.119 --> 17:27.079
"jimmy crack" kornduffer.

17:27.460 --> 17:28.970
while I'm just.

17:28.980 --> 17:30.360
allen.

17:31.140 --> 17:32.760
Well,"allen" is a nice name.

17:32.770 --> 17:34.940
Yeah,try hanging a nickname on it.

17:38.110 --> 17:41.660
I just don't understand why he
has to be so good at everything.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.620
Wait-wait,he's-he's
next.

17:55.110 --> 17:56.340
James.

17:56.640 --> 17:59.150
your word is "susurrate. "

17:59.820 --> 18:00.930
Susurrate.

18:01.550 --> 18:03.940
S-u-S.

18:03.950 --> 18:06.990
u-r-R.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.810
a-t-E.

18:08.820 --> 18:10.060
Susurrate.

18:14.830 --> 18:19.050
Can you spell jimmy crack
kornduffer is a P-I-m-p?

18:19.060 --> 18:20.430
We're going to the finals!

18:20.440 --> 18:21.130
Yes!

18:21.140 --> 18:21.940
High five!

18:21.950 --> 18:23.840
knights ridge! High five!

18:25.030 --> 18:26.210
High five!

18:26.700 --> 18:27.850
Thanks,buddy.

18:27.860 --> 18:30.136
hey,nicky,I made an
appointment to see one

18:30.137 --> 18:32.360
of those apartments
above the apothecary.

18:32.790 --> 18:34.000
Will you come with me?

18:34.470 --> 18:35.880
Yeah,sure.

18:37.680 --> 18:38.650
hey,nick?

18:38.960 --> 18:40.310
I have to go.

18:40.320 --> 18:41.830
- What?
- i do,I'm sorry.

18:42.700 --> 18:44.040
Um,I'll call you later?

18:44.630 --> 18:45.820
Okay.

19:05.760 --> 19:06.440
hey,janet.

19:06.450 --> 19:07.600
Hi,alison.

19:15.030 --> 19:16.120
Alison?

19:16.980 --> 19:18.640
Can I ask you a question?

19:22.410 --> 19:24.930
So I told him we're
watching "on the waterfront,"

19:24.940 --> 19:27.750
which I'm pretty sure he
understood was code for sex.

19:29.310 --> 19:30.370
But what if he didn't?

19:30.800 --> 19:31.970
You can probably make it

19:31.971 --> 19:33.530
pretty clear during the movie.

19:34.190 --> 19:35.540
Well,that's the problem.

19:35.910 --> 19:37.240
I'm not sure I can.

19:38.090 --> 19:39.700
Sorry about dumping this on you.

19:39.710 --> 19:41.770
It's just that hannah and
i are in a bit of a tiff,

19:42.300 --> 19:43.750
and I'm in a bit of a crisis.

19:43.760 --> 19:44.670
That's okay.

19:45.320 --> 19:46.642
It's nice talking to someone

19:46.643 --> 19:48.200
who isn't in elementary school.

19:49.400 --> 19:50.510
So what do I do?

19:50.520 --> 19:52.220
I always tell my kids when they're

19:52.221 --> 19:54.270
nervous about a school play or recital,

19:54.540 --> 19:56.970
to visualize how they want it to go.

19:57.320 --> 19:58.730
Rehearse it in their head.

19:59.690 --> 20:00.850
That's it.

20:00.860 --> 20:02.660
That's it! I need a dress rehearsal.

20:02.670 --> 20:03.790
Well,not literally.

20:03.800 --> 20:05.270
No,it's exactly what I need.

20:05.280 --> 20:07.740
I mean,I can run my moves
over and over in my head,

20:07.750 --> 20:09.810
but what I really ed to do is practice.

20:09.820 --> 20:10.870
I don't think that's a good idea.

20:10.880 --> 20:11.840
It's perfect!

20:11.850 --> 20:13.550
A dry run! I need a dry run!

20:14.680 --> 20:16.500
Now I just gotta figure out with who.

20:16.510 --> 20:19.350
Hey,janet,how we doing
on mustard refills?

20:24.050 --> 20:25.780
Hello,rooster.

20:28.010 --> 20:29.380
give me the definition again.

20:29.890 --> 20:33.960
to issue soft noises,to
speakoftly or indistinctly.

20:33.970 --> 20:36.758
Yes,our own james
kornduffer earned himself

20:36.759 --> 20:39.230
spot in the northeast spelling finals.

20:41.010 --> 20:42.310
no,I got him.

20:51.640 --> 20:53.040
come here,pal.

21:05.060 --> 21:08.050
okay,this is where I
put my hand on his knee.

21:16.570 --> 21:17.990
that wasn't so bad.

21:20.740 --> 21:23.450
then I'll casually rest
my head on his shoulder.

21:33.680 --> 21:35.260
so far so good.

21:37.060 --> 21:38.562
uh,so now I'll say something witty

21:38.563 --> 21:40.020
and insightful about the movie.

21:41.290 --> 21:43.632
It reminds me of "a
streetcar named desire"

21:43.633 --> 21:44.910
only without the rape.

21:45.220 --> 21:47.020
Yeah,that's romantic.

21:47.430 --> 21:49.210
Fine,no insight.

21:49.650 --> 21:51.600
We'll just go straight to making out.

21:59.400 --> 22:01.060
what is this music?

22:01.690 --> 22:03.080
Don't make fun.

22:03.330 --> 22:04.920
It's the bay city rollers.

22:05.590 --> 22:06.993
It's my fantasy to be with

22:06.994 --> 22:08.990
someone I really like to this song.

22:11.580 --> 22:12.690
I'm good with that.

22:12.700 --> 22:13.990
Thank you.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.120
And after a few minutes of kissing,

22:16.760 --> 22:20.200
I gently push him away,

22:20.210 --> 22:22.914
look deeply into his eyes and get

22:22.915 --> 22:25.700
ready to lead us to the bedroom.

22:28.120 --> 22:29.560
I say.

22:31.190 --> 22:35.640
"this still doesn't feel
real,"us being here like this.

22:36.090 --> 22:38.360
I have waited so long. "

22:38.880 --> 22:40.280
Me,too.

22:42.390 --> 22:43.830
rooster!

22:44.220 --> 22:45.190
What?

22:45.200 --> 22:47.040
Hey,listen,what?

22:47.050 --> 22:48.200
Jeez.

22:52.980 --> 22:55.190
oh-oh,god,rooster.

22:55.860 --> 22:56.820
I'm sorry.

22:56.830 --> 22:58.170
I gotta go.

23:02.700 --> 23:03.690
a lease on the apartment?

23:03.990 --> 23:05.250
No,don't sign anything,owen,

23:05.251 --> 23:07.500
until I check it out for
the night noises first.

23:08.270 --> 23:09.820
Look,trust me on this one,okay?

23:10.170 --> 23:11.180
all right,cool.

23:11.190 --> 23:12.290
Bye.

23:15.570 --> 23:16.740
Hey,nick.

23:17.960 --> 23:19.180
Hannah.

23:22.580 --> 23:23.360
How are you?

23:23.370 --> 23:24.850
Good.

23:27.370 --> 23:29.670
Wow,this place
- it looks amazing.

23:31.170 --> 23:32.910
We have accounts now.

23:33.180 --> 23:34.390
A few.

23:34.400 --> 23:35.630
accounts.

23:36.890 --> 23:38.660
Actually,it's just one account.

23:38.910 --> 23:40.490
We're doing the elementary school.

23:42.420 --> 23:43.820
You're really doing it.

23:44.340 --> 23:45.620
Yeah.

23:45.630 --> 23:48.510
No,I mean,like,staying
here in the ridge.

23:50.370 --> 23:51.830
I am.

23:52.570 --> 23:54.031
I'm sure ronnie and your dad must

23:54.032 --> 23:55.580
be really happy to have you back.

23:55.590 --> 23:57.250
Yeah,I suppose.

23:57.260 --> 23:58.620
I mean,who could tell with those two?

23:58.630 --> 24:00.280
Between the burping and the farting.

24:00.290 --> 24:02.450
it's a little hard to
hear the "I love yous. "

24:06.200 --> 24:08.430
I heard you got back
together with your student.

24:09.040 --> 24:10.330
Aubrey.

24:12.640 --> 24:15.020
Yeah,although she's
not my student anymore.

24:15.680 --> 24:17.890
because I got fired.

24:18.670 --> 24:20.240
Yeah,I heard that,too.

24:21.510 --> 24:23.490
Just trying to keep things
lively here in the ridge.

24:23.500 --> 24:25.550
You are succeeding,young man.

24:27.900 --> 24:29.420
How'big cat?

24:29.430 --> 24:30.740
He's good.

24:31.330 --> 24:32.340
He's great.

24:33.570 --> 24:35.100
it's an adjustment.

24:37.310 --> 24:38.920
It is an adjustment.

24:41.550 --> 24:42.890
I ran into sam the other day.

24:42.900 --> 24:45.680
He said he was going on
a school camping trip.

24:45.690 --> 24:48.040
Yeah,it's an annual thing.

24:49.020 --> 24:50.120
I remember.

24:50.130 --> 24:51.910
The commander and i used to go on those.

24:55.210 --> 24:56.390
Is eddie around?

24:56.400 --> 24:57.370
Eddie?

24:57.780 --> 24:58.760
Uh,he.

24:58.770 --> 25:00.310
I don't know where he is,actually.

25:00.320 --> 25:02.280
But he should be back soon.

25:02.290 --> 25:03.420
Okay.

25:04.490 --> 25:05.880
Take it easy,nick.

25:08.470 --> 25:09.700
did you want me to.

25:09.710 --> 25:11.390
tell eddie that you stopped by?

25:11.400 --> 25:13.790
No,just
- I'll see him when I see hi

25:15.510 --> 25:16.740
Bye.

25:17.130 --> 25:18.580
bye.

25:53.150 --> 25:54.540
hey,aubS.

25:57.690 --> 25:59.670
Uh,I-I can call you "aubs," yeah?

26:00.130 --> 26:01.390
Yeah,sure.

26:01.760 --> 26:04.190
Well,I like it. It's
got a warm familiarity.

26:05.030 --> 26:07.370
Maybe I'll call you mr. G.

26:07.750 --> 26:08.900
Yeah.

26:08.910 --> 26:10.040
Why not?

26:12.290 --> 26:13.640
aubs and mr. G.

26:13.650 --> 26:15.010
Mr. G.And aubs,huh?

26:15.660 --> 26:18.140
We could solve mysteries
in merry old england.

26:18.580 --> 26:21.098
Whenever scotland yard is stumped,

26:21.099 --> 26:23.320
they call for Mr. G.And aub.

26:26.800 --> 26:28.270
Hey,everything okay?

26:28.280 --> 26:29.410
Yeah.

26:29.420 --> 26:30.620
Everything's fine.

26:33.310 --> 26:35.590
Well,I'll see ya,mr.

26:44.950 --> 26:47.760
I'm nervous about
tomorrow night's finals!

26:48.290 --> 26:50.810
I'm actually nervous for
jimmy crack kornduffer.

26:51.790 --> 26:53.500
Did I tell y I met his brother?

26:53.510 --> 26:55.250
You did-allen.

26:55.760 --> 26:57.020
You said he was a jerk.

26:57.030 --> 26:58.380
I didn't say he was a jerk.

26:59.310 --> 27:00.470
I said he was bitter.

27:01.940 --> 27:03.190
Sorry.

27:04.130 --> 27:05.930
But why
- y would he be bitter?

27:06.390 --> 27:08.080
His brother's a rock star.

27:14.860 --> 27:16.260
you're home,finally.

27:16.620 --> 27:17.520
Come here.

27:17.530 --> 27:18.600
Now what is it?

27:18.610 --> 27:19.710
Tell the man.

27:19.720 --> 27:21.610
Tell the man what you saw.

27:23.460 --> 27:24.370
Ronnie.

27:24.380 --> 27:25.290
Tell the man,dad.

27:25.300 --> 27:26.030
He must know.

27:26.040 --> 27:27.290
The man must know.

27:27.300 --> 27:28.590
What must I know?

27:29.370 --> 27:30.870
I saw aubs.

27:30.880 --> 27:31.640
I was in town.

27:31.650 --> 27:32.590
She was crying.

27:32.600 --> 27:33.430
Who's aubs?

27:33.440 --> 27:34.210
Aubrey.

27:34.630 --> 27:36.220
Since when is she aubs?

27:36.230 --> 27:39.240
It's,uh,our new warm familiarity.

27:39.250 --> 27:40.760
Okay,this so isn't the point.

27:40.770 --> 27:42.480
What is the point,ronnie?

27:42.490 --> 27:43.840
She's crying.

27:43.850 --> 27:44.970
in town.

27:46.460 --> 27:49.510
She got out of a car
- a car with a man in it.

27:49.520 --> 27:51.440
She got out of a car with a man in it.

27:51.450 --> 27:53.290
It was a blue thunderbird.

27:53.640 --> 27:54.700
Nice car.

27:54.710 --> 27:56.030
So what?

27:56.040 --> 27:58.070
So I'm saying,first the "I lovyou,"

27:58.080 --> 28:00.670
then the sudden exit from the
viewing party and now this?

28:00.680 --> 28:03.200
Nick,do you know who
drives blue thunderbirds?

28:03.210 --> 28:04.330
No. Who,ronnie?

28:04.340 --> 28:05.400
Secret lovers.

28:05.410 --> 28:07.690
Secret lovers drive blue thunderbirds.

28:10.730 --> 28:12.400
So how often do you get in here?

28:13.370 --> 28:14.190
Get.

28:14.530 --> 28:16.570
oh,I haven't been here
since last christmas.

28:17.950 --> 28:19.930
We were going to have
a thanksgiving party.

28:21.950 --> 28:23.280
That's nice.

28:24.190 --> 28:25.740
What-what do yo do up there?

28:25.750 --> 28:27.140
You just-what,study?

28:28.090 --> 28:29.170
I wanna be a teacher.

28:29.520 --> 28:30.980
Teacher?

28:30.990 --> 28:32.690
That's very good. You know,

28:33.000 --> 28:34.650
I
- personally,I admire brains.

28:34.660 --> 28:36.810
My brother charley is a very brainy guy.

28:36.820 --> 28:38.490
He had a couple of years of college.

28:39.490 --> 28:41.217
you know,this movie reminds me of

28:41.218 --> 28:43.730
"a streetcar named
desire," only without the.

28:45.110 --> 28:46.370
never mind.

28:46.380 --> 28:48.460
You know I seen you
a lot of times before?

28:48.800 --> 28:51.740
Remember,uh,parochial
school on pulaski street?

28:52.070 --> 28:55.240
Seven,eight years ago,your hair
- you had your hair,uh.

28:55.250 --> 28:56.510
braids.

28:57.280 --> 28:58.660
It looked like a hunk of rope.

28:59.030 --> 29:00.940
You had wires on your teeth and.

29:01.850 --> 29:03.450
glasses,everything.

29:03.930 --> 29:05.660
You was really a mess.

29:17.660 --> 29:18.700
shall we?

29:43.120 --> 29:44.800
I can't do this.

29:47.590 --> 29:48.590
What's wrong?

29:50.190 --> 29:52.830
What the hell is this music?

29:53.980 --> 29:55.540
It's the bay city rollers.

29:56.480 --> 29:57.650
I've always wanted to-

29:57.660 --> 29:59.330
I
- I can'T.

29:59.630 --> 30:00.820
I'm sorry.

30:03.280 --> 30:04.730
oh,god.

30:09.390 --> 30:10.150
really?

30:10.160 --> 30:11.770
It's their greatest hits.

30:16.790 --> 30:19.360
now that is what I'm talking about.

30:52.490 --> 30:53.360
oh,my god.

30:53.370 --> 30:55.300
You wouldn't believe
how bad I have to pee.

31:18.530 --> 31:20.290
Sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.

31:20.710 --> 31:21.930
Oh,no,that's okay.

31:22.500 --> 31:24.340
I just can't believe you're
already up and at 'em.

31:24.670 --> 31:27.120
Well,I figured you probably
want to get an early start,

31:27.900 --> 31:28.720
and I didn't want to slow you down.

31:28.730 --> 31:30.410
I know you've been busy at work and all.

31:34.360 --> 31:36.700
put the windows in the
school next week,so.

31:39.160 --> 31:40.360
but you know what?

31:41.880 --> 31:44.280
I
- I don't have to go in on sunday.

31:44.760 --> 31:46.280
The spelling bee finals are today.

31:46.290 --> 31:47.530
We could,uh.

31:48.010 --> 31:49.380
we could watch 'em together.

31:49.710 --> 31:52.150
well,at least till you have
to go in to work tonight.

31:54.390 --> 31:56.060
I think I could manage that.

32:15.940 --> 32:16.840
Better?

32:16.850 --> 32:18.030
Much.

32:22.450 --> 32:25.460
Just now,when you were in the bathroom.

32:25.990 --> 32:27.440
yes?

32:29.050 --> 32:30.870
I almost went through your purse.

32:33.350 --> 32:34.630
Okay.

32:35.300 --> 32:36.470
how come?

32:36.480 --> 32:37.730
To.

32:37.740 --> 32:39.120
look for.

32:39.130 --> 32:40.170
things.

32:40.600 --> 32:42.050
Clues?

32:42.400 --> 32:44.440
Clues to what?

32:44.450 --> 32:47.570
Clues to whether or not you're.

32:47.940 --> 32:49.140
seeing someone else?

32:49.150 --> 32:49.960
Yes.

32:49.970 --> 32:52.320
Nick,I thought we covered this.

32:52.330 --> 32:55.200
We did,but the way you
left the viewing party,

32:55.210 --> 32:58.210
and then there was the whole
blue thunderbird incident.

32:58.950 --> 32:59.840
what?

32:59.850 --> 33:04.190
The commander saw you getting
out of one driven by a man.

33:05.660 --> 33:07.080
you were upset.

33:07.720 --> 33:09.980
I don't owe you any explanations,nick.

33:12.870 --> 33:13.570
I know you don'T.

33:13.580 --> 33:16.238
But if I did,I'd tell
you tt ieft the viewing

33:16.239 --> 33:18.550
party because taylor called in a state.

33:19.050 --> 33:20.990
She and her boyfriend
had a monster fight,

33:21.000 --> 33:22.660
threw all of his stuff into the quad,

33:22.670 --> 33:25.270
and then needed me to help
put it back before hcame home.

33:25.610 --> 33:28.819
Oh,and then,when I tried
to broker a peace between

33:28.820 --> 33:32.090
taylor and her blue-thunderbird-
driving boyfriend,

33:32.570 --> 33:35.200
he told me to go to hell
and to take taylor with me.

33:35.590 --> 33:38.400
So that's what I'd say if i
did owe you an explanation.

33:38.760 --> 33:42.010
Oh,and,mm,I'd also say
that I'd appreciate it if

33:42.011 --> 33:45.460
the members of your family
would stop spying on me.

33:47.890 --> 33:49.580
I'm sorry,aubrey.

33:51.570 --> 33:56.050
on behalf of all the garrett
men,myself most of all.

33:57.890 --> 33:59.550
We're almost good,nick.

33:59.940 --> 34:01.180
We just.

34:01.190 --> 34:03.210
we gotta get out some kinks-

34:03.220 --> 34:04.970
a few trust issues.

34:06.240 --> 34:09.179
Hey,you wanna watch the
reege-bee finals tonight?

34:09.500 --> 34:11.120
I'm gonna go meet owen at sully'S.

34:11.130 --> 34:12.489
I can'T.

34:12.500 --> 34:15.370
I am going to boston
to see the foo fighters.

34:15.780 --> 34:17.030
With who?

34:17.040 --> 34:18.340
My lover.

34:18.830 --> 34:20.929
He just flew in from paris.

34:20.940 --> 34:22.900
- Oh,really?
- Yeah.

34:22.909 --> 34:24.080
- I'm kidding.
- I know.

34:24.090 --> 34:25.210
With taylor.

34:25.860 --> 34:26.840
You wanna come?

34:27.210 --> 34:28.530
No,it'S.

34:29.460 --> 34:31.420
it's okay. You guys have fun.

34:34.050 --> 34:35.400
Are we cool?

34:38.310 --> 34:39.800
We are very cool.

34:42.639 --> 34:44.230
I didn't order anything.

34:44.239 --> 34:47.100
I know,but here's the thing.

34:47.830 --> 34:49.002
You don't need to feel bad

34:49.003 --> 34:50.580
about resenting your kid brother.

34:51.330 --> 34:52.650
I have four sisters

34:52.650 --> 34:55.150
- regina,alexandra,teresa and egg.

34:55.400 --> 34:56.520
Egg is the baby.

34:56.530 --> 35:00.570
They all have spectacular
husbands and or boyfriends.

35:00.830 --> 35:02.590
They all have meaningful jobs.

35:02.600 --> 35:04.190
They wear smart clothes.

35:05.080 --> 35:08.060
They all think I'm an
oddling who did nothing but

35:08.061 --> 35:10.920
break our parents' hearts
during my wild years,

35:11.430 --> 35:15.360
but growing up in the enormous
maw that was their shadows-

35:15.990 --> 35:17.470
you know what that made me?

35:17.480 --> 35:18.730
Pizza delivery girl?

35:19.600 --> 35:22.480
It made me strive to be better-

35:22.490 --> 35:26.220
to advance my lot in
life,not to compete with them,

35:26.600 --> 35:28.760
but to build a better oddling.

35:28.770 --> 35:30.900
But you're living in this tiny toy town.

35:30.910 --> 35:35.170
For now,but I have
plans,the first of which is,

35:35.840 --> 35:38.130
we're gonna root against
jimmy crack kornduffer.

35:39.150 --> 35:40.150
Me and you.

35:40.160 --> 35:42.190
Come on. Let's fight the power.

35:42.200 --> 35:45.090
