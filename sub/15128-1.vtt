00:12.402 --> 00:13.942
And you are?

00:14.585 --> 00:16.180
I'm Railways.

00:17.775 --> 00:19.894
Who are you?
- We

00:20.410 --> 00:21.894
own guns.

00:24.997 --> 00:26.696
My apologies if I'm late.

00:28.354 --> 00:31.116
Another way it has been layed out for me.

00:31.466 --> 00:33.466
In these here indications.

00:33.735 --> 00:38.156
It is you who now will tell us
the wins and outs.

00:51.024 --> 00:53.761
You have met him.
- I have not.

00:54.190 --> 00:57.309
But all these instructions.

00:58.048 --> 01:00.167
He is a sly one, is he not?

01:00.556 --> 01:02.731
Wait in his cell far away from us all.

01:02.897 --> 01:05.909
Well come on then,
tell us how this way to get rich.

01:12.174 --> 01:15.587
The time tabelling, the point systems,
I have computed it all.

01:15.810 --> 01:20.333
And here, see? This is how the Bishopsgate
goods line may be intruded upon.

01:24.238 --> 01:26.278
The one we pinch will be bigger.

01:31.668 --> 01:34.104
See?
Railways.

03:00.527 --> 03:02.234
Good Morning, Chief Inspector.

03:03.317 --> 03:04.923
What is it brings you by?

03:09.029 --> 03:13.204
Well, if you might be distracted
from your beloved archive.

03:15.154 --> 03:17.734
There is news
I would share with you, Edmund.

03:18.972 --> 03:22.344
Indeed.
Urgent, I imagine, given the hour.

03:25.980 --> 03:28.987
First however, there is a matter
to which I must attend.

03:33.456 --> 03:35.249
If you please, Constable Grace.

03:42.184 --> 03:44.184
Eight and a half by

03:44.930 --> 03:47.811
six and a quarter, Inspector.
- Other features?

03:49.748 --> 03:53.104
Scarring left mastoid collarbone.
- What is this?

03:55.700 --> 03:57.153
This ain't coppery.

03:57.179 --> 04:01.848
You may well say.
- Is it not, Mr Cree?

04:03.393 --> 04:05.345
What?
Haslen.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.352
Not the name that you gave
to my booking sergeant.

04:07.377 --> 04:10.274
But you are Herbert John Cree.

04:10.300 --> 04:12.661
Three counts of receiving stolen goods.
One of larceny.

04:12.687 --> 04:15.116
Wanted on suspicion
of two counts of burglary.

04:15.330 --> 04:16.916
It's no wonder to me

04:17.116 --> 04:20.067
that you have so informed
an opinion on our work.

04:21.197 --> 04:22.697
What is it you wish from me.

04:22.722 --> 04:26.603
I wish you to enlighten me, Mr Cree.
- You wish me to snitch, were you.

04:28.682 --> 04:29.984
But I knew.

04:32.405 --> 04:35.086
On all and on everything.

04:35.635 --> 04:37.468
Each villain, every paymaster.

04:37.494 --> 04:41.493
Each and every whispered scheme or rumour,
no matter how trifling they seem,

04:41.619 --> 04:43.508
I want them all.

04:50.674 --> 04:51.952
You?

04:57.905 --> 05:01.252
How I am now alone with my vices.

05:05.826 --> 05:09.386
I'm taking my pension, Edmund.
Bournemouth.

05:09.516 --> 05:12.095
Or so Mrs Abberline's thinking runs.

05:12.175 --> 05:15.858
It is my reccommendation,
I should be replaced by you.

05:17.687 --> 05:19.860
Who then to seek my work here completed?

05:19.885 --> 05:21.877
The archive, Chief Inspector.

05:24.418 --> 05:27.783
Do you not see what it is I built here?

05:27.886 --> 05:31.169
Be they pimp or pornographer

05:31.500 --> 05:35.642
confidence man or blackmailer,
thief, fence and cracksman or pickpocket.

05:35.919 --> 05:39.498
Soon there will not be a villain
in Whitechapel or the East, whose

05:39.593 --> 05:42.609
particulars, habits or associates
are not known to me.

05:42.847 --> 05:45.061
To me, Fred.

05:46.172 --> 05:49.268
And you would have me dozing
in a deckchair in St. James' Park.

05:49.339 --> 05:52.513
I would, my Friend.
Dozing in the sunshine,

05:52.649 --> 05:54.720
blessed by a breeze.

05:55.461 --> 05:57.929
Instead this.

05:58.516 --> 06:00.103
The villains of this quarter,

06:00.207 --> 06:04.024
turn from blood and bone,
into scratchings on paper.

06:04.643 --> 06:06.768
In what hope, Inspector?

06:07.322 --> 06:10.917
The fat cyphers might carry you
to the door of the devil himself.

06:11.409 --> 06:14.607
Fred Abberline lectures me on obsession
as is a rum night.

06:14.695 --> 06:18.711
No, I am yet your superior,
and you will mind me.

06:20.007 --> 06:22.404
Drake is gone, your Yankee dismissed.

06:22.539 --> 06:25.682
Yet here you are still.
Alone, but for your books.

06:26.555 --> 06:29.142
I would see you gone from this place, Edmund,

06:29.753 --> 06:32.316
before it swallows you hole.

07:02.299 --> 07:04.863
Now there's only you to work this system.

07:04.968 --> 07:08.238
I do hope, that you are as good
as your word, Railways.

07:10.063 --> 07:11.277
Railways.

07:11.302 --> 07:14.531
This signal system
was first built in april '75.

07:14.609 --> 07:17.910
Before then were points who has been
hand worked down on the tracks themselves.

07:17.935 --> 07:20.378
Railways.
I care not.

07:21.616 --> 07:23.735
Now.
He stirs

07:24.069 --> 07:25.751
he gets a clad.
Understand?

07:27.529 --> 07:29.243
We go to set our trap.

07:29.338 --> 07:33.114
Use that knowhow of yourse
ans send that engine to us.

07:44.731 --> 07:48.493
People have died to contact you.
- It's at Whitechapel.

07:48.906 --> 07:51.946
They die for day.
- 55 lives,

07:52.104 --> 07:54.659
given up for 350.000.

08:02.522 --> 08:04.855
People have died to contact you.

08:04.942 --> 08:06.172
It's at Whitechapel.

08:06.838 --> 08:08.727
They die for day.

08:25.767 --> 08:27.676
Hail morning to you, darling.

08:28.569 --> 08:30.482
Oh God, he's American.

08:31.045 --> 08:34.957
I never did make any pretence to the fact.

08:48.135 --> 08:50.079
I'm Hermini...
- Morton.

08:52.040 --> 08:55.739
It's Mimi for short.
I remember.

08:56.499 --> 08:58.800
You're found at Bob Blewitt's
two months back.

08:58.825 --> 09:03.167
Ever since then you attend even performances
on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays

09:03.243 --> 09:07.735
usually around a company, but occaisionally
you bring an escort.

09:08.696 --> 09:12.267
Damn you, Ivan.
- His name you remember I see.

09:16.612 --> 09:18.667
Well.
Who are you?

09:26.080 --> 09:28.974
If you will not say, I shall see for myself.

09:37.308 --> 09:38.602
A doctor?

09:49.533 --> 09:51.660
That man.
The Ripper.

09:51.935 --> 09:55.585
There was a notion, was there not,
that he was perhaps, an American doctor?

09:55.760 --> 09:57.069
It persists.

09:57.904 --> 09:59.704
Shall I be very frightened?

10:04.396 --> 10:06.872
Captain Homer Jackson.

10:06.943 --> 10:08.546
You were an army man once?

10:08.753 --> 10:12.157
Once a law man also,
but now only a sawbones.

10:12.610 --> 10:16.459
So you be careful, it's sharp.
- Is it indeed.

10:17.078 --> 10:19.022
Do you wield it with skill?

10:20.249 --> 10:22.844
If harm came onto me in these dark streets,

10:22.916 --> 10:25.973
would you bring me here and clean my wounds,
and make me whole again?

10:26.257 --> 10:29.217
If you ask nicely.
- I ask now.

10:31.519 --> 10:32.971
Ask nicer.

10:36.765 --> 10:38.368
And when you are done

10:40.574 --> 10:42.415
with courtesy.

10:51.326 --> 10:53.516
The documents you asked for, Miss Hart.

10:54.817 --> 10:57.087
My solicitor, Mr Capshaw.

10:58.542 --> 11:01.574
Counselor Cobden.
It is a pleasure.

11:05.732 --> 11:07.218
Our clinic.

11:07.586 --> 11:08.855
It makes something new here

11:08.881 --> 11:13.151
and should not anticipate such an undertaking
to be met with universal approval.

11:13.525 --> 11:17.085
There will be complaint.
Some of it certain to be legal.

11:19.362 --> 11:21.092
Your organisation.

11:21.742 --> 11:24.702
When I think on what
Obsidian its state once was,

11:24.830 --> 11:26.806
a bastion of inequity,

11:27.266 --> 11:31.258
and what it now is.
Something that was once so opaque,

11:31.507 --> 11:33.578
self-serving primitive,

11:33.913 --> 11:37.667
it is now a beacon of civic participation
and progress.

11:38.397 --> 11:42.206
And it is all down to you, Miss Hart.
- Counselor, you're too kind.

11:42.383 --> 11:44.131
Too kind by stretch.

11:44.755 --> 11:47.802
It's about the soundest of business philosophies
that we here embrace.

11:47.867 --> 11:50.375
Indeed.
And would you share it?

11:51.689 --> 11:54.395
There is no great sophistication,
it is simply this.

11:54.863 --> 11:58.903
What is best for the people of the East,
is also best for Obsidian.

12:09.135 --> 12:10.457
Miss Hart.

12:15.106 --> 12:17.789
Our first intakers selected.

12:19.289 --> 12:22.011
The Obsidian Clinic's
first students and nurses.

12:22.266 --> 12:23.868
I have met them all this week.

12:24.039 --> 12:27.975
And each calls this quarter their home?
- Off course. As you insisted.

12:28.840 --> 12:30.649
Will you be here to greet them yourself?

12:30.674 --> 12:34.055
It is thanks to your generosity after all,
that I employed them.

12:34.111 --> 12:37.714
I will, Doctor Frayn.
And all those that follow.

12:43.332 --> 12:44.966
Fourteen past eight.

12:45.443 --> 12:48.427
The Dock's Company engine crosses
the cutting at St John's.

12:48.625 --> 12:50.839
Only this morning it does not.

13:04.795 --> 13:06.446
Seventeen past eight.

13:07.343 --> 13:09.513
I'm scheduled diversion Eastwood.

13:19.869 --> 13:21.194
What the hell's that?

13:21.488 --> 13:22.972
We're divertin'.

14:00.283 --> 14:01.514
Railways.

14:01.585 --> 14:04.918
If you weren't so agony, I'd kiss ya.

14:19.209 --> 14:21.122
That is some precise signaling.

14:21.852 --> 14:23.733
Thieving the Bishopsgate run are you?

14:25.640 --> 14:27.608
And you have allowed
for the Necropolis, yes?

14:28.386 --> 14:31.283
You mean the London
Necropolis & National Mausoleum Company?

14:32.061 --> 14:35.638
That runs under London and Blackwall.
Stay off off here.

14:35.664 --> 14:38.952
But there is engineering on the line
of as it occurs, since monday.

14:38.999 --> 14:41.078
They travel the same tracks.

14:41.405 --> 14:43.142
Gregory Enright.

14:52.322 --> 14:54.513
Look.
Where did that come from?

14:58.481 --> 15:00.005
We're gonna crash.

15:01.080 --> 15:02.437
Tell me which one.

15:02.691 --> 15:04.048
What number?

15:04.074 --> 15:05.816
There's no time.

15:08.873 --> 15:11.778
What is it?
- Number 25.

15:28.733 --> 15:32.607
Damn good job did you, Railways.
Damn good job.

16:16.737 --> 16:20.902
Whoever made such a plan,
they made it well.

16:21.717 --> 16:24.461
Next stop.
Farringdon, ladies and gentlemen.

16:24.487 --> 16:28.187
Farringdon, and all stations
to Whitechapel terminus.

16:35.208 --> 16:38.113
Wait. Please.
Come on.

16:38.690 --> 16:40.161
I'll take one of those.

16:40.187 --> 16:42.192
Thank you, mister.
- You go on that train.

16:42.218 --> 16:44.885
Come on, soldier, I'll take that.
Here we go.

16:45.652 --> 16:47.528
Blimey, what've you got in there?

16:50.565 --> 16:53.768
Here we go.
- Thank you, mister.

16:54.072 --> 16:56.223
Mister?
- Drake.

17:12.476 --> 17:17.674
-

17:17.935 --> 17:24.840
-

17:29.474 --> 17:32.604
-

17:32.636 --> 17:34.003
Mister Drake.

17:34.939 --> 17:37.280
Where is it you travel today?
- Arthur.

17:38.502 --> 17:40.202
I do appologize, Mister Drake.

17:40.483 --> 17:42.459
No, please ma'am, no apologies.

17:43.229 --> 17:45.718
I travel through to Whitechapel, Arthur.

17:45.800 --> 17:47.775
Oh, as we ourselves do.

17:50.649 --> 17:52.681
Do you know it well, Sir?
- Arthur.

17:55.174 --> 17:56.539
Well, soldier.

17:57.047 --> 18:00.086
I've not walked it's streets
for gone four years now.

18:01.909 --> 18:03.695
But once.

18:04.925 --> 18:06.125
Yes.

18:06.893 --> 18:08.520
I knew it well.

18:31.334 --> 18:32.850
Whitechapel.

18:33.040 --> 18:34.973
See?
That's Leman Street.

18:35.136 --> 18:36.969
Then we're on the passenger line.

19:30.463 --> 19:32.138
Oh, no, no, no.

19:53.846 --> 19:55.092
The people.

19:55.632 --> 19:57.196
Help them.

19:57.521 --> 19:58.846
Wire for more men.

20:11.456 --> 20:13.818
Mother?

20:43.167 --> 20:45.932
There will be many dead, Gregory Enright.

20:46.841 --> 20:49.000
You question how it is I know your name?

20:50.121 --> 20:51.367
I do not.

21:10.049 --> 21:13.509
No, please.  Please, you're not this man.
You're not. Gregory. No.

21:13.786 --> 21:16.798
No, please don't.
No, I beg you. No.

21:18.596 --> 21:19.827
No.

21:35.418 --> 21:38.649
Get the people off the street
and into te Station House, Grace.

21:42.879 --> 21:44.403
Captain Jackson.

21:45.292 --> 21:46.492
Sergeant.

21:48.348 --> 21:49.578
Reid.

21:49.919 --> 21:53.216
I imagine the men in my calling
might find some purpose here.

21:55.913 --> 21:57.525
See he get's what he needs.

21:59.564 --> 22:01.484
Three groupings, sergeant, you follow me?

22:01.873 --> 22:05.383
First. Those who most likely live,
regardless of what we do for them.

22:05.484 --> 22:08.216
Second.
Those who might care of me saving them.

22:09.469 --> 22:12.137
Third...
- Those passed saving.

22:23.637 --> 22:24.988
Mister Reid.

22:35.965 --> 22:37.759
Are you just gonna stand there?

23:06.107 --> 23:07.361
Here.

23:12.845 --> 23:14.102
Here.

23:26.319 --> 23:27.617
I have you.

23:29.389 --> 23:30.771
Mister Reid?

23:35.969 --> 23:37.413
To me, Mr Reid.

23:40.688 --> 23:43.347
Here you go.
I got you.

23:44.258 --> 23:45.671
You're alright.

24:06.281 --> 24:08.448
Drake.
Lay her here.

24:09.035 --> 24:11.940
She's gonna be alright.
- Long time no see, Drake.

24:12.019 --> 24:15.825
What is this? Are we all in fact dead,
and you're here to greet us?

24:20.513 --> 24:22.061
Excuse my hand, darling.

24:22.109 --> 24:24.196
You hear me?
You hear me?

24:24.254 --> 24:26.730
Okay. You're gonna be okay.
You.

24:40.741 --> 24:43.823
What?
- Give me work. Tell me what to do.

24:45.390 --> 24:47.716
You have coin on you?
- Ofcourse.

24:47.858 --> 24:51.556
You get to the dispensary. To the London
if need being, you bring me morphine.

24:51.582 --> 24:54.862
There's needs in meds, Captain.
Courtesy of Obsidian estates.

25:01.343 --> 25:04.676
Miss Susan Hart, this is...
- I know who she is.

25:11.595 --> 25:14.119
Hello.
Miss Erskine.

25:15.515 --> 25:18.761
Hello, Mister Best.
- This is compassionate. Really is.

25:19.002 --> 25:22.255
The star you now are,
come here to dispense comfort

25:22.281 --> 25:24.995
and a few fond words to these poor wretches.

25:25.153 --> 25:28.198
They will be all the more grateful
you are now returned in such glory

25:28.224 --> 25:30.316
to Whitechapel.
A picture perhaps?

25:30.958 --> 25:32.903
A rose amid the rubble?

25:36.942 --> 25:38.886
Will you excuse me, Mr Best?

25:42.537 --> 25:44.878
George.
Here, take him off of me.

26:11.276 --> 26:12.736
You will come home?

26:14.078 --> 26:15.594
And I am come home.

26:16.919 --> 26:18.154
And this...

26:21.840 --> 26:23.308
I came to see you, Rose.

26:24.015 --> 26:26.245
With the Alexandra, last year.

26:26.872 --> 26:29.395
You were a marvel.

26:32.126 --> 26:34.919
But you did not say hello?

26:36.840 --> 26:38.578
No, I thought it best not.

26:39.132 --> 26:42.679
Youe were... 
You were with a gent, after.

26:44.157 --> 26:45.688
But you looked happy.

26:46.523 --> 26:48.331
And that made me happy.

26:51.451 --> 26:54.289
Bennet.
It's a long way.

26:55.194 --> 26:57.573
Manchester Piccadilly through Whitechapel.

26:58.102 --> 26:59.645
What is it brings you here?

27:01.221 --> 27:02.764
It's best I do not say.

27:28.472 --> 27:29.672
Tom.

27:40.328 --> 27:41.693
Know him?

27:50.546 --> 27:51.746
Tom?

27:52.580 --> 27:53.780
Tom?

27:54.842 --> 27:56.042
Freddie.

28:07.905 --> 28:09.643
You comfort him?

28:13.727 --> 28:16.473
Wait, I'm here, Tom.
I'm here.

28:35.973 --> 28:37.465
Inspector.
- Madam.

28:39.687 --> 28:42.489
Such ruin...
It is

28:43.724 --> 28:46.796
senseless.
- These streets,

28:48.292 --> 28:51.806
each day, I hope I might have seen
the last of their cruelty in office.

28:54.577 --> 28:58.982
That pure awful chance.
Nothing in this world to be done for it.

28:59.496 --> 29:00.955
It is hard medicine.

29:02.277 --> 29:04.833
But there will be cause for it somewhere.

29:05.428 --> 29:07.737
A root of one sort or other creeping away.

29:08.564 --> 29:10.039
Silence.
Now.

29:14.775 --> 29:16.030
You hear that?

29:28.457 --> 29:30.679
Over here.
- What is that uniform?

29:30.878 --> 29:32.219
The Necropolis line.

29:36.348 --> 29:37.687
Lay him down here.

29:39.459 --> 29:40.697
Easy, easy.

29:44.797 --> 29:46.122
What has happened here, Mr Reid?

29:46.148 --> 29:50.012
We are under resourced, Mr Drake, and no
longer enjoy the benefit of our surgeon.

29:50.037 --> 29:51.981
Drake, there is Laudanum in my bag.

29:54.029 --> 29:57.434
Wait, wait.
We cannot drug him.

29:57.489 --> 30:00.902
Drake, you tell him that,
this man is in pain.

30:01.052 --> 30:04.298
Mr Drake, his engine, the Necropolis.

30:04.735 --> 30:07.893
Its line, the line for Manor Park,
it is a mile east of here.

30:08.419 --> 30:12.247
He was off-course and perhaps the root
of this carnage. He must talk to us.

30:21.849 --> 30:24.674
Intrathoracic and intra-abdominal bleeding,

30:24.700 --> 30:27.501
the man's organs are ruptured.
They come apart.

30:27.541 --> 30:29.382
He must speak.
- Drake,

30:29.536 --> 30:33.265
you're gonna tell him that there is nothing
that this man must do, not ever again.

30:33.593 --> 30:36.928
He's dying.
Now give him the Laudanum.

30:45.971 --> 30:47.641
Sir.

30:49.089 --> 30:51.224
You were off-course, where you not?

30:51.479 --> 30:53.549
Docks.
Trying...

30:53.827 --> 30:55.176
find...

30:55.256 --> 30:58.558
Ma... 
Mars men.

31:09.730 --> 31:11.627
The wires need to be worked, Sir.
Who is your operator?

31:11.652 --> 31:15.364
Constable Grace.
- Listen, son, Bishop's got you all in Goodman's.

31:15.888 --> 31:18.452
See what report he's made
discover what thieved.

31:18.588 --> 31:19.816
Do it.

31:20.118 --> 31:22.888
He's giving orders.
- He's Inspector now.

31:23.784 --> 31:26.419
Inspector Drake.
No shit.

31:26.475 --> 31:27.785
Arthur.

31:30.669 --> 31:34.446
Did someone come for you, boy?
No father or grandparents?

31:37.542 --> 31:38.875
You see that man?

31:39.328 --> 31:42.788
Now, he may dress odd,
and talk odder still...

31:42.931 --> 31:45.534
but you can trust him.
He can trust you.

31:45.987 --> 31:49.027
Stay with him, alright. Only a whiles.
- Now wait a minute.

31:49.106 --> 31:50.804
One hour, Jackson.
- Drake.

31:53.722 --> 31:56.438
I have never been inside
a police station before.

31:57.452 --> 31:59.754
Yeah well, their charm soon fades.

32:03.674 --> 32:06.198
You got any idea
what to do with one of those?

32:07.590 --> 32:09.114
Not even the first.

32:29.129 --> 32:30.898
Four years you are gone, Bennet,

32:30.956 --> 32:33.995
four years since I put Captain Jackson
out on the street also.

32:34.057 --> 32:36.534
And now here, on this day, on that train,

32:37.383 --> 32:38.742
you are returned.

32:41.516 --> 32:45.024
I heard of your rise through the ranks
of the Manchester City Police.

32:45.235 --> 32:49.196
enrolled as an uniform Counstable no less.

32:50.267 --> 32:52.371
Did you hide your true rank from them?

32:53.283 --> 32:54.557
I did.

32:55.192 --> 32:57.161
And so, you are made a new.

32:58.765 --> 33:00.677
What put you on that train, Bennet?

33:01.163 --> 33:03.282
Did they not have need of you up there?

33:03.885 --> 33:05.266
I'm on leave, Sir.

33:07.766 --> 33:09.520
Holidaying in Whitechapel?

33:13.991 --> 33:15.586
Mr Reid, I meant to say...

33:17.102 --> 33:18.943
I wanted to say, Inspector.

33:20.083 --> 33:21.392
Word reached me,

33:22.726 --> 33:24.170
of Mrs Reid's passing.

33:26.502 --> 33:28.208
I wrote, Sir.
- Yes, I know.

33:29.643 --> 33:32.485
Ik know.
I was glad for it, Bennet.

33:34.829 --> 33:36.123
The signalbox.

33:36.551 --> 33:40.962
Whatever measure of control sat behind
this chaos, that is where it did so.

33:54.318 --> 33:56.825
Goods train.
An accomplish drives it in.

33:57.111 --> 33:59.033
Born for Bishopsgate and Goodman's.

33:59.073 --> 34:03.199
The villains who done this robbed the London
and India dock company therefore.

34:04.602 --> 34:08.275
And one man up here.
More sent a foot and the tracks deboarded.

34:08.337 --> 34:11.268
But for then to be thrown at
the path of an accomplice.

34:11.784 --> 34:13.725
Whoever stood here must only have been,

34:14.012 --> 34:17.431
what, fetching it here.
Fetching it, to do their robbing unlodged.

34:17.463 --> 34:19.884
in an abandoned shed hereabout.
- And this...

34:21.002 --> 34:23.072
The man's wrists were bound first.

34:23.342 --> 34:27.311
And any further details of his execution,
need reading with an expert eye.

34:29.248 --> 34:30.449
Mr Reid.

34:31.272 --> 34:34.931
Whatever it is, that may have passed
between you and the American,

34:36.770 --> 34:40.763
these last years,
my work has been greatly varied,

34:41.270 --> 34:44.255
but I have met no man with gifts...
- Gifts?

34:45.101 --> 34:46.752
The drowning in gin,

34:47.179 --> 34:48.625
sleeping in gutters.

34:49.235 --> 34:52.514
Inspector.
So much death...

34:53.192 --> 34:55.136
Whatever his current habits,

34:55.350 --> 34:58.415
needs must the best man
go searching for the root of it.

35:00.819 --> 35:04.400
Then you must ask him, Bennet.
Because he will not hear it from me.

35:09.815 --> 35:11.545
I go to hunt that goods train.

35:37.687 --> 35:39.234
Are you here?

35:43.667 --> 35:45.659
We did as you instructed.

35:45.961 --> 35:48.437
Every part as you instructed.

35:48.818 --> 35:51.674
Do you know at what price this was come by?

35:53.024 --> 35:56.016
Do you?
Answer me.

35:56.899 --> 35:59.185
We have deaths on our hands.

35:59.693 --> 36:02.225
Kiddies among them.
Kiddies.

36:03.597 --> 36:07.924
And I do not merit such guilt.
I do not.

36:10.072 --> 36:11.961
I want you to take it.

36:13.350 --> 36:17.318
Those deaths, the wrong.
All yours.

36:21.215 --> 36:22.898
Tomorrow,

36:24.588 --> 36:28.588
you will have our share as promised.
Otherwise...

36:33.383 --> 36:35.217
May God damn you.

38:15.465 --> 38:16.703
I wonder,

38:17.885 --> 38:20.282
if I just simply through it all
into the fire,

38:21.139 --> 38:23.853
would the last day
vanish up te chimney stack also?

38:26.506 --> 38:30.324
And leave you and I here to sit
in agree to turn our backs on such villainy.

38:33.450 --> 38:35.973
Did not have you marked as whimsical, Madam.

38:38.742 --> 38:40.901
Fiftyfive, we're now told.

38:41.996 --> 38:46.631
Fiftyfive lives, given up for $350.000

38:46.958 --> 38:49.727
in unregistered and anonymous bearer bonds.

38:53.012 --> 38:56.528
Because you saw an opportunity.

39:07.497 --> 39:09.298
Does this buy back life?

39:16.888 --> 39:19.626
Does this?
- You are beside yourself.

39:20.404 --> 39:22.801
You must calm.
- Must I?

39:24.085 --> 39:27.267
You are my employee, Mr Capshaw,
best you remember that.

39:27.791 --> 39:31.386
And if I wish to burn the evidence
of our certain damnation, then I shall.

39:31.418 --> 39:32.854
Well, then burn it.

39:33.346 --> 39:36.947
But I currently lack for better ideas
of how we might fill the gaping chasm

39:36.972 --> 39:38.998
in this institutions finances.

39:39.328 --> 39:41.542
When the stirling exchange of these bonds

39:41.605 --> 39:44.860
will keep our books balanced for ten years.

39:45.059 --> 39:47.964
I've been happy in my work, Miss Hart.

39:49.503 --> 39:53.474
I've served you assiduously in the seaming
transformation of this houses practices.

39:53.569 --> 39:55.822
Yes, we are yet money lender
to our neighbours,

39:55.848 --> 39:59.494
indeed we are yet so in the certain
knowledge of they're the fault in thereon.

39:59.563 --> 40:03.814
But where is the not much lamented Mr Dugham was
content to then aquire their rotten practices

40:03.840 --> 40:05.784
to rot further in his own enrichment?

40:05.958 --> 40:07.910
You would have us demolish the old

40:08.394 --> 40:10.061
and develop a fresh.

40:10.783 --> 40:14.259
It's an admirable enterprise indeed.
But as you know...

40:15.947 --> 40:19.232
This houses covers can not continue
to provide for them.

40:19.772 --> 40:21.875
Brickwork, sewerage,

40:22.042 --> 40:25.637
open public spaces,
your cherished Obsidian clinic,

40:26.509 --> 40:29.501
the new Jerusalem that you had built here,
we agreed in.

40:34.624 --> 40:37.870
This is bad money.

40:38.442 --> 40:42.886
Bad American money, destined for bad ends,
here in London.

40:43.213 --> 40:47.713
We may take it and ennoble its purpose.

40:50.483 --> 40:52.784
People have died, God damn you.

40:53.254 --> 40:55.032
But in Whitechapell,

40:57.945 --> 40:59.818
they die every day.

41:00.411 --> 41:02.562
A fact that you, with this,

41:04.403 --> 41:07.926
would seek to correct.
So this...

41:10.318 --> 41:12.635
This in your hands,

41:14.976 --> 41:16.580
becomes alive.

41:18.736 --> 41:20.467
Alive, Miss.

41:23.004 --> 41:26.243
Nobody wants dead
and they wander the way to Leman Street.

41:28.463 --> 41:31.519
Off your fragile wrists up
to your friend Mr Reid.

41:32.088 --> 41:34.080
On what all that you have made,

41:35.366 --> 41:37.175
or you would make,

41:39.896 --> 41:41.467
fall to ruin.

42:25.729 --> 42:29.610
There's a man in a signalbox out there,
with his brains removed from it.

42:30.450 --> 42:33.346
Hey, kid, I paid for that,
I expect to see that eaten.

42:33.713 --> 42:36.292
First glance, I'd say, a shotgun.

42:36.356 --> 42:37.681
Eat it, God damn it.

42:37.737 --> 42:40.745
Will you not come?
- No, Drake, I will not.

42:41.396 --> 42:42.983
Rebels me so,

42:43.047 --> 42:45.890
the poor assumption of yours that four years
after you up and disappear,

42:45.916 --> 42:48.522
I still can have my lunch
in a tingle Leman Street.

42:59.081 --> 43:02.033
He is something.
Take a dead man

43:02.192 --> 43:04.706
he'll tell you, what he ate for breakfast
three days ago.

43:04.731 --> 43:08.327
And whether it's that which poisoned him,
or the strychnine in his tea.

43:08.489 --> 43:11.417
Indeed, Captain Jackson?
- Drake, you listen to me.

43:11.544 --> 43:14.650
I do not police no more.

43:15.632 --> 43:18.028
Jackson.
Look around you.

43:18.185 --> 43:22.373
This, what must be discovered,
here in Whitechapel,

43:23.086 --> 43:24.713
what all here now need,

43:25.166 --> 43:28.659
it is not policing.
It is only answers.

43:38.787 --> 43:40.755
When did you get devious?

43:58.419 --> 43:59.661
Well?

44:01.717 --> 44:03.051
I'm rusty, Reid.

44:04.066 --> 44:06.409
You seek the fault of death,
look to yourself.

44:07.502 --> 44:11.923
There is buckshot. A shotgun is assumed.
- Our genius has returned to us, then?

44:13.806 --> 44:16.846
It's the first shot, one one assumes.
- Assumed how?

44:16.925 --> 44:18.385
It missed, Reid.

44:19.544 --> 44:23.322
Miss intirely. The parabal is six feet here,
as it passes to the wall.

44:24.435 --> 44:28.879
The shot came from near enough here.
The target is...

44:29.157 --> 44:32.292
well, there.
That's some piss-poor marksmanship.

44:33.784 --> 44:35.482
How what we got here?

44:37.380 --> 44:39.535
Drake.
There's a hand lens over there.

44:42.806 --> 44:44.036
You've gotten eager.

44:45.377 --> 44:48.369
It's heavy damaged above the
epidermis and dermis.

44:48.425 --> 44:50.597
Over the trauma is in the shape of an oval.

44:50.623 --> 44:53.354
The butt of a shotgun.
- Oh, the mind of this man.

44:53.628 --> 44:55.541
But there's patterning here, also.

44:55.930 --> 44:58.113
The blow is like a stamp on the man's face.

44:58.198 --> 45:01.904
The steel plate of the butt of the gun
would have had an ingravings and lettering.

45:01.929 --> 45:05.009
It's an 'A' and a 'W', I can see.

45:05.123 --> 45:06.433
And an 'R'.

45:08.350 --> 45:09.810
No?
Well...

45:10.520 --> 45:13.989
Wouldn't expect you to know.
They are American guns afterall.

45:14.089 --> 45:16.692
It's 'W' for Winchester, 'R' for Repeating,

45:16.718 --> 45:19.891
'Winchester Repeating Arms Company'.
You got the shells?

45:25.253 --> 45:27.991
That's a fine weapon.
It's a pump action.

45:28.055 --> 45:31.873
An exotic beast in these parts, you might say.
- It might if I were talking to you.

45:32.871 --> 45:35.855
It is a straight forward fire arm, however.
Simple and direct.

45:35.927 --> 45:37.402
Indeed.
- Yet he misses with it.

45:37.427 --> 45:39.554
From a good five yards.
- It's a heavy gun, however.

45:39.610 --> 45:41.666
It's hard to manage.
- And a child?

45:41.728 --> 45:44.117
A child?
Who has the skills to operate these?

45:44.143 --> 45:46.340
Someone impaired, therefore.
- Therefore,

45:46.365 --> 45:49.587
he cannot lift the barrel up for
the first shot, so he spoons it to the left.

45:49.669 --> 45:53.272
And he uses the top rail of the chair
and helps stabilize his aim.

45:53.298 --> 45:55.067
And as you say, Bennet, he is

45:55.093 --> 45:56.928
educated in the workings of this system.

45:56.953 --> 46:00.270
And in the details of both the time tabling
and the tracking hereabout.

46:00.358 --> 46:03.604
But not the engineering work there on.
- No. Nonetheless,

46:03.708 --> 46:07.461
he would not have been able to aquire this
certain pertise mainly by being an enthousiast.

46:07.534 --> 46:09.747
He has worked this system at some point.

46:09.984 --> 46:11.389
That bares another question.

46:11.532 --> 46:13.865
Why shoot him at all?
- The other men.

46:14.077 --> 46:16.901
His accomplices, they wore masks.
Did they not?

46:16.957 --> 46:21.567
And it been some struggle to get that gun up.
He must have felt some reason to kill this man.

46:21.592 --> 46:23.584
But he recognized them.

46:23.647 --> 46:26.497
Despite the masks, and all.
- And thus the silencing.

46:26.600 --> 46:29.438
But he is impaired.
We are saying.

46:29.486 --> 46:31.542
An arm or a shoulder or some such.

46:31.769 --> 46:33.388
And he knows this system.

46:33.420 --> 46:36.308
So this crippling was what?
A well known much disgust,

46:36.333 --> 46:38.213
misfortune in the workyard, perhaps?

46:38.238 --> 46:40.505
An uncompensated accident even.

46:40.938 --> 46:43.359
Gives him the motive, knowledge and skill.

46:43.391 --> 46:45.486
He was a railway man once.

46:46.022 --> 46:50.727
I shall have the London and Tilbury Company
widen their employment records run to Leman Street.

46:50.768 --> 46:54.887
As for these shotguns, I have an idea
as to where their providence may be found.

47:04.643 --> 47:05.928
What is this place?

47:07.055 --> 47:08.562
His new plaything.

47:13.552 --> 47:17.994
Mister Cree, did I not tell you, that in due
course you would be of use to me once more.

47:18.019 --> 47:21.264
FT Baker, gunmakers of Fleet Street
and Cockspur Street

47:21.682 --> 47:24.849
and robbed a five pump action shotguns
three weeks past.

47:24.875 --> 47:28.682
An undertaking with which you yourself
were approached. Were you not?

47:29.460 --> 47:31.851
They was after Winchesters.
- But what of it?

47:33.743 --> 47:36.057
I shan't be asking you again.
- Yes, alright.

47:36.703 --> 47:38.108
That was Winchesters.

47:39.052 --> 47:41.218
But I didn't take the job.
It smelled rotten.

47:41.243 --> 47:43.235
Tell Mr Drake for why, Mr Cree.

47:44.631 --> 47:46.040
Didn't like the look of him.

47:46.417 --> 47:48.838
Of who?
- Allow me, Inspector Drake.

47:48.913 --> 47:51.077
I did not know his name, Inspector,

47:51.103 --> 47:55.294
I swear that he would not say, but round
these streets you do get to know most felons.

47:55.389 --> 47:59.808
Particularly those with the ware with of all such
actions and I had not seen him this way before.

48:00.439 --> 48:03.069
Witness was asked to describe
the gentleman in question.

48:03.256 --> 48:05.990
And so?
- He looked wrong.

48:07.522 --> 48:12.014
Skinny. Like a village parson
got off the wrong station.

48:13.236 --> 48:16.348
Polished his shoes too bright.
All shiny they was.

48:18.487 --> 48:19.958
Which a man notices.

48:21.170 --> 48:23.291
When there's this much shit on the street.

48:24.360 --> 48:28.079
The London and Tilbury's sent their runners, Sir.
Their employment records.

48:28.637 --> 48:31.733
Put Mr Cree back in his cell.
I'll have use of him yet, I hope.

48:34.565 --> 48:36.001
Crushed leg.

48:38.134 --> 48:39.418
Broken foot.

48:41.634 --> 48:43.832
I have you.
Here. Enright, Gregory.

48:44.301 --> 48:45.801
Shunter, 1892.

48:45.827 --> 48:49.642
Left shoulder crushed while coupling an engine
to goods stock at Commercial Roads Station.

48:49.712 --> 48:51.869
Never compensated.
- There is an address?

48:51.894 --> 48:53.144
There is.

49:37.816 --> 49:39.077
Works perfect.

49:40.690 --> 49:43.345
No, Sir, it was flawed.

49:45.142 --> 49:47.862
Everything.
I thought I played for all.

49:49.200 --> 49:51.406
But there were details I did not forsee.

49:52.128 --> 49:56.048
And you would add more death
to a tellee that now reaches 55, would you?

49:56.128 --> 49:59.420
Fiftyfive?
What matters one more?

50:03.653 --> 50:06.066
What work it must have been for you, Sir.

50:10.230 --> 50:11.526
The railways.

50:12.016 --> 50:15.066
But to what reward you put your life
into your work.

50:15.397 --> 50:17.820
and your work decides to keep that life?

50:18.014 --> 50:19.474
And not return it to you.

50:21.498 --> 50:23.631
It gave you committment,

50:24.045 --> 50:26.409
with body and soul, every waking hour,

50:26.974 --> 50:28.752
to a world that takes that loyalty,

50:29.030 --> 50:31.814
and cares not one spot for you in return.

50:35.112 --> 50:36.338
Catch.

50:42.030 --> 50:43.834
You will hang me now, will you not?

50:43.859 --> 50:47.105
That decision will follow
from what now you tell me, Mr Enright.

50:47.213 --> 50:51.229
You, Sir, are skilled.
You are an ordinary man.

50:51.817 --> 50:53.777
Such a scheme the other men gathered,

50:53.803 --> 50:56.856
I do not for a minute believe,
you're the origin of this atrocity.

50:56.894 --> 50:59.815
I am only railways,
I have only ever been railways.

50:59.870 --> 51:02.545
So you were recruted.
By who?

51:03.885 --> 51:06.607
I never met him.
- I do not believe you, Mr Enright.

51:06.654 --> 51:08.416
Please, Sir, I swear it.

51:09.691 --> 51:11.929
He found me, I do not know how.

51:12.627 --> 51:15.524
But it was a letter through my door
that I was to earn money.

51:15.818 --> 51:18.492
You find me a person hereabout,
cripple or not,

51:18.898 --> 51:20.692
it's just not in that question.

51:20.718 --> 51:23.025
So you must have been met, seen him?

51:23.065 --> 51:27.636
No, we... Myself... The other men,
we were chosen for one skill or another.

51:27.906 --> 51:30.335
You trusted in its anomalous bidding,
did you?

51:30.391 --> 51:34.128
So I put my faith in anything
that promises me fivehundred pound.

51:34.289 --> 51:37.129
And where is your
fivehundred pounds now, Mr Enright?

51:37.369 --> 51:39.543
We were to get it.
- When, Sir.

51:39.569 --> 51:42.504
Right here this morning we are to meet him.

51:46.604 --> 51:50.302
Do you know, Mr Enright? I think
might permit you to fetch your gaines.

51:57.635 --> 51:59.635
We shall see his face this morning.

51:59.976 --> 52:02.079
He who would set men to steal guns.

52:02.105 --> 52:05.183
He who exhumes crippled railway men
for their learning.

52:05.636 --> 52:09.209
He who would leave the dead of Whitechapel
behind him. He will be known to me.

52:09.715 --> 52:12.644
Still nothing, no report is made?
- My apologies, Mr Reid.

52:12.693 --> 52:16.160
Whatever was took from that sea-can
it's owner is still yet to make complain.

52:16.185 --> 52:17.963
Il only need to know its contents.

52:18.614 --> 52:20.717
You have his provenance?
- Yes, Mr Drake.

52:20.774 --> 52:25.227
The stevedores reported loaded from a domestic
cargo transport from Hoboken, New Jersey.

52:26.020 --> 52:27.512
Such a scheme.

52:27.917 --> 52:30.044
Whatever it was, we must assume it valuable.

52:30.069 --> 52:32.954
I hope therefore that Enright and his cohort
provide us with an answer.

52:32.979 --> 52:34.805
Or at least their employer.

52:35.176 --> 52:36.501
Mr Reid.

52:36.527 --> 52:40.226
The men await your instructions
as to how their warehouse is to be vigilated.

52:42.980 --> 52:44.249
No, no, Captain.

52:45.027 --> 52:49.059
Captain Jackson, this is a police assignment
and as such I'm sure you understand,

52:49.089 --> 52:51.581
these details must be considered sensitive.
So,

52:52.541 --> 52:56.592
my thanks for your service.
But I think you might get to your bed. Or...

52:56.913 --> 52:59.663
whatever other activity you choose
to persue at this hour.

53:12.682 --> 53:15.793
Constable Grace.
You're a smart one.

53:16.755 --> 53:19.850
He always did like them smart.
Quick to learn.

53:20.326 --> 53:22.199
Well, here's a lesson for you, son.

53:22.896 --> 53:27.172
The faster you can quit this man in his work,
the better it's gonna go for you.

53:29.610 --> 53:33.355
If you don't take my word for it,
you just ask the good Inspector Drake here.

53:46.220 --> 53:48.632
-

54:21.513 --> 54:22.812
Coffee?

54:26.448 --> 54:27.709
How old are the grains?

54:28.577 --> 54:29.910
Couple off days.

54:30.257 --> 54:33.111
To which you assume a week.
- Look, do you want some, or not?

54:44.335 --> 54:46.835
I can't imagine it's that doing you here for.

54:48.425 --> 54:52.432
You'r a good deal too grand for me these days.
- Not an issue which troubles Miss Morton.

54:52.567 --> 54:55.385
Yeah well, she comes here for something else.

55:02.677 --> 55:05.740
I'm told you once more provide service
to the police.

55:06.034 --> 55:08.137
That is an old habit in which to fall.

55:08.163 --> 55:11.811
And old friend, it is not something
I intend of practice off.

55:12.138 --> 55:15.948
Nonetheless a woman could be forgiven
for thinking time had turned backwards.

55:17.542 --> 55:18.724
Look Susan, I'm tired.

55:18.750 --> 55:22.760
I'm gonna kick-off my boots and go to sleep.
You gonna tell me what it is brings you here?

55:25.556 --> 55:27.048
I'm petitioned.

55:30.174 --> 55:34.380
Who by? One of the many greateful citizens
of your new republic?

55:36.133 --> 55:40.412
I swear, one morning I'm gonna wake-up
and find you anointed Lord Mayor of London.

55:43.758 --> 55:46.770
I don't know which of your constituencies,
it petitions you.

55:48.050 --> 55:49.478
The bereaved.

55:50.843 --> 55:55.340
Those who wait to see if their mothers,
or fathers, or children might yet live.

55:57.197 --> 56:00.150
There is one question
they ask which unites them.

56:00.745 --> 56:04.737
They wish to know why
their lives were turned to ruins in a trice.

56:04.763 --> 56:08.824
You want to know why those trains collided
and against whom the world might lay blame.

56:09.810 --> 56:12.151
The people wish to know.

56:20.410 --> 56:22.968
Mister Drake?
- Chief Inspector.

56:23.314 --> 56:25.814
Where is he?
- At the floor above us, Sir.

56:26.005 --> 56:28.695
And so.. 
Have you missed us?

56:29.606 --> 56:31.879
There is now way quite like Whitechapel, Sir.

56:32.803 --> 56:35.366
He has asked after the for why

56:35.517 --> 56:37.755
behind you're return to us?
- He has.

56:38.826 --> 56:40.049
You've told him?

56:40.582 --> 56:44.074
This last day,
it is not gone by how I imagined.

56:44.527 --> 56:48.434
No.
But you see why it is I've asked you here.

56:48.941 --> 56:53.222
He appears undiminished to me, Sir.
His commitment, his skills.

56:53.576 --> 56:57.846
It is not the loss of such attribute
that concern me, Mr Drake.

56:58.408 --> 57:01.463
It is the loss of he.
Himself.

57:02.854 --> 57:05.274
Yes, Sir.
- Inspector.

57:05.496 --> 57:07.385
Chief Inspector, you're sent for.

57:15.847 --> 57:17.062
He comes.

57:58.550 --> 58:01.209
He has not arrived?
- No.

58:04.225 --> 58:06.502
Little while yet, Railways.

58:08.087 --> 58:10.222
Then we shall have our spend it.

58:29.161 --> 58:32.939
My canary has sung.
Do you assure me, Ronald,

58:32.979 --> 58:37.661
that these men, who now wait their earnings,
they've not seen you, you are sure?

58:39.120 --> 58:40.533
Certain.

58:42.620 --> 58:45.070
Then those earnings
shall remain in the rears.

58:46.487 --> 58:48.229
And the police shall have them.

58:48.907 --> 58:51.848
They wil hang alone,
and not with you and I beside them.

58:58.225 --> 59:01.018
We can not think they will
wait further, Inspector.

59:01.043 --> 59:04.574
There is another.
Their paymaster, the architect of this all.

59:04.905 --> 59:08.183
And there is no other means
by which this man might be found?

59:08.209 --> 59:10.296
There is a man in my cells,

59:10.699 --> 59:14.772
he's called Cree. I believe he has met him,
but his description is vague.

59:14.913 --> 59:16.342
Can not be pursued alone.

59:16.878 --> 59:18.417
And so we must wait.

59:33.144 --> 59:34.375
Enough.

59:44.315 --> 59:46.069
Where are you?

59:48.394 --> 59:50.553
I shall sit here no further.

59:52.864 --> 59:55.535
You want my advice, you do likewise.

01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:11.925
They leave, Mr Reid.

01:00:12.845 --> 01:00:15.258
Those men held up an engine
on the Bishopsgate, aint it?

01:00:15.297 --> 01:00:18.956
They did. If we take footsoldiers now,
a General walks free.

01:00:18.990 --> 01:00:22.878
We do not. Whitechapel must live without now
in its dormant as a game, Edmund.

01:00:22.904 --> 01:00:26.315
A game. This is an order, Inspector.
You take them.

01:01:06.945 --> 01:01:08.145
Well now.

01:01:08.762 --> 01:01:11.603
This moment might be considered apposite,
Mr Drake.

01:01:13.191 --> 01:01:17.448
Come now, Inspector, you are no longer
to look at your shoes in this man's ambit.

01:01:17.612 --> 01:01:20.588
Thinking of now...
Not now,

01:01:20.651 --> 01:01:24.294
you've rejoined H-Division at equal rank.

01:01:25.284 --> 01:01:28.665
What?
Without one word of consultation?

01:01:28.856 --> 01:01:31.253
Consultation?
With you?

01:01:31.364 --> 01:01:33.594
That would be a fine circumstance.

01:01:33.919 --> 01:01:37.808
I been clear with you, Mr Reid.
Could not be clearer.

01:01:38.213 --> 01:01:40.094
Mister Drake is the aid

01:01:40.427 --> 01:01:43.538
with the purpose
of Leman Street's transition.

01:01:43.570 --> 01:01:47.245
Transition from your control into his.

01:01:48.554 --> 01:01:50.840
I been unhonest about this, my friend.

01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:53.446
You are for promotion.

01:01:53.668 --> 01:01:56.111
Promotion away from here.

01:01:56.361 --> 01:01:59.184
By the time Mrs Abberline drags me south,

01:01:59.795 --> 01:02:02.263
you will be gone from these streets.

01:02:18.623 --> 01:02:19.949
Take  them away.

01:02:24.138 --> 01:02:28.615
You men will be taken next to the prison
in which you will last confine.

01:02:29.937 --> 01:02:32.810
And from there to a place of execution.

01:02:33.874 --> 01:02:38.102
Where you will be hanged by the neck
until you are dead.

01:02:47.258 --> 01:02:49.996
Thou carriest them away as with a flood.

01:02:50.742 --> 01:02:53.036
They are like grass which groweth up.

01:02:54.187 --> 01:02:55.980
In the morning it flourisheth

01:02:56.710 --> 01:02:58.679
and in the evening it is cut down.

01:03:04.426 --> 01:03:07.140
For we are consumed by Thine anger.

01:03:07.354 --> 01:03:09.831
Thou hast set our iniquities before thee.

01:03:10.011 --> 01:03:12.876
Our secret sins in the light
of Your countenance.

01:03:15.016 --> 01:03:17.730
For all our days are passed away in Thy wrath

01:03:19.833 --> 01:03:24.038
and we spend our years
as a tale that is told.

01:03:32.941 --> 01:03:34.152
Amen.

01:03:35.044 --> 01:03:36.322
Amen.

01:04:17.602 --> 01:04:19.713
Mister Reid.
- Counselor Cobden.

01:04:20.348 --> 01:04:22.102
You are to be congratulated.

01:04:22.538 --> 01:04:25.570
Swift punishment has afforded us
some comfort at least.

01:04:32.373 --> 01:04:33.810
If you will excuse me.

01:04:39.646 --> 01:04:42.821
Now, we are brazen.

01:04:51.156 --> 01:04:52.934
Inspector.
- Madam.

01:04:55.470 --> 01:04:58.169
A black Day.
- Indeed.

01:04:59.825 --> 01:05:02.101
This is my solicitor.
Mr Capshaw.

01:05:09.586 --> 01:05:11.007
Your name again, Sir?

01:05:12.451 --> 01:05:13.776
Capshaw.

01:05:17.348 --> 01:05:20.096
Cree.
