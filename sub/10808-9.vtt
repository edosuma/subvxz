00:03.170 --> 00:06.162
(theme music playing)

00:19.687 --> 00:24.558
NARRATOR:
Man lives in the sunlit world

00:24.558 --> 00:29.018
of what he believes
to be reality.

00:30.531 --> 00:33.968
But... there is,

00:33.968 --> 00:38.505
unseen by most, an underworld.

00:38.505 --> 00:42.176
A place that is just as real

00:42.176 --> 00:46.280
but not as brightly lit.

00:46.280 --> 00:49.044
A dark side.

01:03.831 --> 01:05.666
WOMAN:
Oh, yeah, a week together

01:05.666 --> 01:07.234
next summer would be great,
Lois.

01:07.234 --> 01:08.402
I'll run it by Bill.

01:08.402 --> 01:09.970
LOIS: (over phone):
How's he doing?

01:09.970 --> 01:11.939
WOMAN:
0h, Bill? Oh, well, you know,

01:11.939 --> 01:13.641
he says he doesn't feel well,

01:13.641 --> 01:15.776
but, you know, he's always
like that in between books.

01:15.776 --> 01:18.472
-(Lois speaks indistinctly)
-Mm-hmm.

01:19.380 --> 01:20.914
Yeah, right. Can't sleep,

01:20.914 --> 01:24.118
and he thinks every headache's
the first sign of a brain tumor.

01:24.118 --> 01:27.588
Well, I know. He'll be fine
once he gets something going.

01:27.588 --> 01:28.689
LOIS:
Yes.

01:28.689 --> 01:30.024
I know, I know,
I probably won't be able

01:30.024 --> 01:32.059
to keep him down,
if you know what I mean.

01:32.059 --> 01:33.060
Mom?

01:33.060 --> 01:35.195
Mm. Just a sec, Lois.

01:35.195 --> 01:38.065
I want to tape Spider's Kiss,
but Connie won't let me.

01:38.065 --> 01:39.867
She says it's too gross.

01:39.867 --> 01:41.135
It is.

01:41.135 --> 01:42.936
Look, you guys,
I am talking long-distance

01:42.936 --> 01:44.605
with your Aunt Lois,
and I do not think

01:44.605 --> 01:46.807
this is the time
for sibling rivalry, okay?

01:46.807 --> 01:49.276
It was Dad's first book.
Don't you even care?

01:49.276 --> 01:50.277
No.

01:50.277 --> 01:52.046
WOMAN:
Ask your dad if you can

01:52.046 --> 01:54.214
tape it on the VCR in his study.
He'll show you how.

01:54.214 --> 01:56.483
Okay. Good idea.

01:56.483 --> 02:00.054
Oh, and tell him that I said
to edit out all the gory stuff.

02:00.054 --> 02:01.689
Aw, do l have ta?

02:01.689 --> 02:03.223
Yes, you "have ta."

02:03.223 --> 02:04.858
See?

02:04.858 --> 02:06.927
Connie!

02:06.927 --> 02:08.195
(children laughing)

02:08.195 --> 02:10.597
Oh, no, no, the kids are just
squabbling again.

02:10.597 --> 02:13.333
Well, Polly used to be able
to keep them in line,

02:13.333 --> 02:15.836
but now
that she's away at school...

02:15.836 --> 02:17.071
Oh, I don't know.

02:17.071 --> 02:19.306
Maybe it wasn't
such a good idea, after all.

02:19.306 --> 02:20.574
LOIS:
How come?

02:20.574 --> 02:24.411
Well, lately when she calls,
she just seems so upset.

02:24.411 --> 02:26.980
Yeah, I know,
but it's hard on me, too.

02:26.980 --> 02:28.816
I miss her.

02:28.816 --> 02:32.052
I don't like having my children
so far away from me.

02:32.052 --> 02:33.620
(woman laughs)

02:33.620 --> 02:36.890
I don't know what I'm gonna do
when they're grown.

02:36.890 --> 02:38.325
You're right.

02:38.325 --> 02:40.418
There's always Bill,
isn't there?

02:47.234 --> 02:48.635
Booga-booga!

02:48.635 --> 02:50.304
Hi, Jeffy.

02:50.304 --> 02:52.539
How come you didn't get scared?

02:52.539 --> 02:54.942
Scary is my business.
l'm case-hardened.

02:54.942 --> 02:56.477
Something wrong?

02:56.477 --> 02:58.846
Can I watch the first hour
of Spider's Kiss,

02:58.846 --> 03:00.214
and you record the rest?

03:00.214 --> 03:02.616
Connie's hogging everything.

03:02.616 --> 03:04.384
(dog barks in distance)

03:04.384 --> 03:07.187
(imitates Dracula): Are you sure
you want to watch that, champ?

03:07.187 --> 03:08.188
(normal voice):
It's pretty scary.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.485
Yeah!

03:10.891 --> 03:13.594
Oh, I really think Jeffy needs
the orthodontic work now,

03:13.594 --> 03:15.429
but you know Bill.

03:15.429 --> 03:17.231
(phone ringing)

03:17.231 --> 03:19.199
Oh, Lois, hold on.
That's the other line.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.634
Bill, could you get
the other...?

03:20.634 --> 03:22.436
Honey, where are those blank
video tapes?

03:22.436 --> 03:24.938
-I can't find any in the study.
-(ringing continues) -Wait.

03:24.938 --> 03:27.174
I'm gonna put you
on hold, Lois.

03:27.174 --> 03:28.375
(static over phone)

03:28.375 --> 03:31.078
FEMALE CALLER (sobbing):
Oh... Ta... Take...

03:31.078 --> 03:32.479
Hello?

03:32.479 --> 03:34.748
CALLER:
Please take...

03:34.748 --> 03:37.117
Polly, is that you?
Honey, it's Mom.

03:37.117 --> 03:38.118
(static crackles)

03:38.118 --> 03:39.745
(sobbing):
Oh.

03:41.789 --> 03:43.323
Polly, what's wrong?

03:43.323 --> 03:45.125
CALLER:
Quick, please!

03:45.125 --> 03:46.794
(sobbing continues)

03:46.794 --> 03:47.961
Now, honey, calm down.

03:47.961 --> 03:49.792
Whatever it is,
it can't be that...

03:51.298 --> 03:53.630
Oh, no.

03:55.669 --> 03:57.933
-(dial tone)
-Damn!

04:07.447 --> 04:09.516
Uh, listen, Lois, I'm gonna
have to call you back.

04:09.516 --> 04:10.517
That was Polly.

04:10.517 --> 04:11.618
LOIS:
Polly called?

04:11.618 --> 04:13.387
Yeah. She sounded
really upset this time.

04:13.387 --> 04:14.955
LOIS:
Did she say what's wrong?

04:14.955 --> 04:15.956
No. She hung up.

04:15.956 --> 04:16.957
LOIS:
Call me back...

04:16.957 --> 04:19.793
Yeah. Okay, M will. Thanks.

04:19.793 --> 04:21.228
What?

04:21.228 --> 04:23.597
It was Polly
crying her head off, Bill.

04:23.597 --> 04:24.765
-What's wrong?
-(touch tones beeping)

04:24.765 --> 04:25.933
You know, it sounded like

04:25.933 --> 04:27.601
she was saying
"I want to come home."

04:27.601 --> 04:28.769
"Please take me home."

04:28.769 --> 04:30.204
Honey, c-calm down.

04:30.204 --> 04:31.839
YOUNG WOMAN (over phone):
Harcheran Hall.

04:31.839 --> 04:33.941
If you want
Christine the Sex Queen,

04:33.941 --> 04:35.776
she's still in the shower,
Arnie.

04:35.776 --> 04:38.245
Could you please bring
Polly Weiderman to the phone?

04:38.245 --> 04:39.847
This is her mother.

04:39.847 --> 04:41.114
YOUNG WOMAN:
Oh, geez.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.083
Uh, sorry, Mrs. Weiderman.
Hang on.

04:43.083 --> 04:44.751
(phone clunks down)

04:44.751 --> 04:46.453
(sighs)

04:46.453 --> 04:48.422
I found one, Daddy.

04:48.422 --> 04:50.123
In a minute, Jeff.
Go on up.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.291
-But...
-I won't forget.

04:51.291 --> 04:52.656
Now, go on.

04:55.896 --> 04:57.664
-Come on! Come on! Come on!
-Katie!

04:57.664 --> 04:59.233
No, Bill. You didn't hear her.

04:59.233 --> 05:00.567
She sounded just so...

05:00.567 --> 05:01.735
POLLY:
Hi, Mom.

05:01.735 --> 05:03.303
Pol? Honey, are you all right?

05:03.303 --> 05:05.372
POLLY:
All right? Are you kidding?

05:05.372 --> 05:06.807
I just aced my bio exam,

05:06.807 --> 05:09.710
and Ronnie Hanson asked me
to the dance Saturday night.

05:09.710 --> 05:12.379
(chuckles): Now you call and ask
if I'm all right?

05:12.379 --> 05:14.848
You didn'tjust call here a
second ago crying your head off?

05:14.848 --> 05:16.783
POLLY:
Heck, no!

05:16.783 --> 05:18.318
Okay.

05:18.318 --> 05:21.655
Uh, honey, I-I'm glad
about your test and your date.

05:21.655 --> 05:23.790
I guess
it was just somebody else.

05:23.790 --> 05:26.093
Um, Polly, I'm gonna have
to call you back, okay?

05:26.093 --> 05:27.995
POLLY:
Okay, Mom. Say hi to Dad.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.897
-Yeah, I will, hon.
-Bye.

05:29.897 --> 05:31.498
She okay?

05:31.498 --> 05:33.767
Yeah. I'd say
that was an understatement.

05:33.767 --> 05:36.236
God, I could have sworn
it was Polly.

05:36.236 --> 05:37.537
So it was a prank--

05:37.537 --> 05:42.242
somebody crying so hard,
they dialed the wrong number,

05:42.242 --> 05:44.011
It was not a prank, Bill!

05:44.011 --> 05:45.579
And it was not a wrong number.

05:45.579 --> 05:47.147
It was someone in my family.

05:47.147 --> 05:48.849
-Honey, you can't know that.
-Oh, no?

05:48.849 --> 05:51.218
If Jeffy called just crying,
would you know it was him?

05:51.218 --> 05:53.687
Yeah. Maybe. I-I guess so.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.689
(touch tones beeping)

05:55.689 --> 05:57.680
-(|ine ringing)
-Oh.

06:02.729 --> 06:03.730
WOMAN (over phone):
Hello?

06:03.730 --> 06:06.233
Mom, are you...?

06:06.233 --> 06:08.869
Uh, did you, uh, just call here
a second ago?

06:08.869 --> 06:10.871
No, dear. Why?

06:10.871 --> 06:13.006
Oh, well,
you know these phones.

06:13.006 --> 06:16.310
I was talking to Lois,
and I lost the other line.

06:16.310 --> 06:17.744
MOM:
Well, it wasn't me, Katie.

06:17.744 --> 06:20.147
By the way,
I saw the prettiest dress...

06:20.147 --> 06:21.648
Mom, can I call you back?

06:21.648 --> 06:23.016
MOM:
Are you all right?

06:23.016 --> 06:24.918
Uh... no. I...

06:24.918 --> 06:26.086
(sighs)
I, uh...

06:26.086 --> 06:27.621
I have a little diarrhea, Mom.

06:27.621 --> 06:29.523
I gotta go. Bye.

06:29.523 --> 06:31.458
(laughing)
Diarrhea. That's great.

06:31.458 --> 06:33.727
I gotta remember that
when my agent calls.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.718
This is not funny, Bill!

06:38.598 --> 06:40.327
CONNIE:
Is everything all right?

06:42.369 --> 06:44.237
I don't know.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.273
Everything's fine, honey.
Your mom just got a...

06:46.273 --> 06:48.275
a funny kind of phone call,
that's all.

06:48.275 --> 06:50.911
Go on back. Watch some tube.

06:50.911 --> 06:54.081
Yeah. Oh, Ijust overreacted,
honey.

06:54.081 --> 06:56.283
Really, it's okay.

06:56.283 --> 06:58.385
Really?

06:58.385 --> 07:00.148
Really.

07:07.961 --> 07:09.952
Shh.

07:11.898 --> 07:14.801
(water dripping)

07:14.801 --> 07:17.471
I tell you, I knew that voice.

07:17.471 --> 07:19.773
-If Polly's okay...
-Dawn.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.541
Come on, hon. A minute ago,
you were sure it was...

07:21.541 --> 07:23.643
I was on the phone with Lois.
Mom's okay.

07:23.643 --> 07:24.845
She's the only one left.

07:24.845 --> 07:26.713
Bill, she's the youngest.

07:26.713 --> 07:28.949
I-I could've mistaken her
for Polly.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.816
Oh, God, Bill, it's Dawnie.

07:32.819 --> 07:34.343
(touch tones beeping)

07:35.922 --> 07:37.913
(click, busy signal)

07:42.029 --> 07:44.231
Bill, I'm scared.

07:44.231 --> 07:46.222
(Bill sighs, clears his throat)

07:50.971 --> 07:52.139
(dial tone)

07:52.139 --> 07:54.408
(beep, line ringing)

07:54.408 --> 07:56.009
OPERATOR:
Thank you for calling AT&T.

07:56.009 --> 07:58.712
Yeah, Operator, uh, I'm trying
to reach my sister-in-Iaw,

07:58.712 --> 07:59.713
and the line is busy.

07:59.713 --> 08:00.714
There may be a problem.

08:00.714 --> 08:01.948
Could you break through, please?

08:01.948 --> 08:03.383
OPERATOR:
What is your name, sir?

08:03.383 --> 08:05.318
Weiderman. William Weiderman.
My number is...

08:05.318 --> 08:06.420
OPERATOR:
Not the William Weiderman?!

08:06.420 --> 08:08.655
The one that wrote
Spider's Kiss?

08:08.655 --> 08:10.424
That-That was mine. Yes, it...

08:10.424 --> 08:13.393
OPERATOR:
Oh, God, Ijust love that book.

08:13.393 --> 08:15.028
I love all your books. Ijust...

08:15.028 --> 08:17.030
I'm delighted that you did,
but-but right now,

08:17.030 --> 08:19.199
my wife is very worried
about her sister.

08:19.199 --> 08:20.634
If you could break in, please.

08:20.634 --> 08:22.803
OPERATOR:
Of course. What's the number?

08:22.803 --> 08:25.397
BILL:
555-6169.

08:26.540 --> 08:27.700
(sighs)

08:31.478 --> 08:32.846
OPERATOR:
I'm sorry, Mr. Weiderman.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.347
That line is not busy;
it's off the hook,

08:34.347 --> 08:36.616
-and there's no response
to my signal. -Oh?

08:36.616 --> 08:39.920
OPERATOR: I was wondering...
if I sent you my copy

08:39.920 --> 08:41.788
of Spider's Kiss, would you...?

08:41.788 --> 08:43.723
Why'd you hang up?

08:43.723 --> 08:45.725
Phone's not busy;
it's off the hook.

08:45.725 --> 08:47.527
There's no response
to the operator's signal.

08:47.527 --> 08:50.130
Bill, she's out in the middle
of nowhere, alone.

08:50.130 --> 08:51.198
What do you mean, alone?

08:51.198 --> 08:52.799
Jerry's up in Burlington
on business,

08:52.799 --> 08:54.926
and Dawn and the baby
are by themselves!

08:56.036 --> 08:59.472
Honey, something is very wrong.

09:03.944 --> 09:05.935
(crickets chirping)

09:22.395 --> 09:23.563
Her car's here.

09:23.563 --> 09:24.731
(sighs)

09:24.731 --> 09:26.333
I don't like this.

09:26.333 --> 09:28.324
(sighs)

09:31.671 --> 09:33.507
Booga-booga.

09:33.507 --> 09:35.709
How long have you had that?

09:35.709 --> 09:38.245
Since last month, after all
those murders in Coleville.

09:38.245 --> 09:39.379
(sighs)

09:39.379 --> 09:41.006
Didn't want to scare you
and the kids.

09:42.516 --> 09:44.751
I got a permit for it.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.786
Let's hope the damn thing works.

09:46.786 --> 09:48.755
Oh.

09:48.755 --> 09:50.222
(sighs)
Come on.

09:57.464 --> 09:59.591
(owl hooting in distance)

10:11.378 --> 10:12.868
(whispering):
Look at the lock.

10:14.915 --> 10:16.906
Stay behind me.

10:19.085 --> 10:21.788
(door creaking open)

10:21.788 --> 10:23.779
(TV playing indistinctly)

10:30.797 --> 10:32.832
MAN (on TV):
Now I understand.

10:32.832 --> 10:33.833
(gasps softly)

10:33.833 --> 10:35.164
Oh, my God.

10:37.103 --> 10:38.371
(door closes)

10:38.371 --> 10:40.066
(indistinct voices on TV)

10:41.408 --> 10:44.434
(phone beeping off the hook)

10:45.745 --> 10:47.212
(sighs)

10:49.816 --> 10:52.319
(music playing over headphones)

10:52.319 --> 10:54.421
I heard some people just eat up
my books,

10:54.421 --> 10:56.389
but this is ridiculous.

10:58.525 --> 10:59.526
(music stops)

10:59.526 --> 11:00.961
(sighs)

11:00.961 --> 11:03.020
Hi, Dawn.

11:04.831 --> 11:07.234
Oh, hi.

11:07.234 --> 11:09.269
Oh, you guys should have called.

11:09.269 --> 11:11.004
The place is a mess.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.106
We tried to call, Dawn,

11:13.106 --> 11:16.243
and the operator said
the phone was off the hook.

11:16.243 --> 11:18.111
Oh, my God!

11:18.111 --> 11:21.081
Bill, I'm sorry,
the baby's teething.

11:21.081 --> 11:23.650
I know some critics who would
say he made a good choice.

11:23.650 --> 11:25.318
(baby fussing loudly)

11:25.318 --> 11:26.649
Oh...

11:28.888 --> 11:30.924
Dawn, I don't want
to scare you, but, uh,

11:30.924 --> 11:33.159
someone was at your front door,
trying to force it.

11:33.159 --> 11:35.028
DAWN: Oh, gosh,
no, no, that was Jerry.

11:35.028 --> 11:38.064
I had locked us out by mistake,
and he was really mad because

11:38.064 --> 11:41.368
he didn't have his key and
he had to take a whiz real bad,

11:41.368 --> 11:43.536
so he took a screwdriver to it.

11:43.536 --> 11:45.372
I had no trouble getting in.

11:45.372 --> 11:46.573
Oh.

11:46.573 --> 11:48.742
Sometimes I forget to lock it.

11:48.742 --> 11:50.910
-(baby cooing)
-Oh.

11:50.910 --> 11:53.446
Dawnie, did you call me
earlier this evening?

11:53.446 --> 11:54.748
DAWN:
Uh...

11:54.748 --> 11:57.117
no, gee, no, I was...
I was too busy.

11:57.117 --> 11:59.019
I was busy with Dustin.

11:59.019 --> 12:02.188
He kept trying to eat
the fabric softener.

12:02.188 --> 12:03.623
And then he finally got sleepy,

12:03.623 --> 12:06.421
so I sat down to wait
for your movie to come on.

12:15.335 --> 12:17.963
(thunder crashing)

12:27.580 --> 12:28.782
(thunder crashing)

12:28.782 --> 12:30.850
(laughs)

12:30.850 --> 12:33.080
(coughing)

12:37.857 --> 12:40.917
(thunder crashing)

12:44.864 --> 12:46.032
(chuckles softly)

12:46.032 --> 12:47.294
Booga-booga!

12:48.968 --> 12:50.070
(groans)

12:50.070 --> 12:52.272
You sure you're not mad at me?

12:52.272 --> 12:53.340
Mm, no.

12:53.340 --> 12:55.501
Not even a little.

12:57.711 --> 13:01.715
It's just, I was
so positive it was...

13:01.715 --> 13:03.316
it was one of mine.

13:03.316 --> 13:04.984
You know what I mean?

13:04.984 --> 13:06.453
One of mine.

13:06.453 --> 13:08.722
Katie, you know how sometimes
you see somebody on the street

13:08.722 --> 13:11.991
you thought you knew,
turns out to be a stranger?

13:11.991 --> 13:13.793
I can still hear those sobs.

13:13.793 --> 13:17.731
So... lost, so heartbroken.

13:17.731 --> 13:21.101
Well, there are soundalikes
as well as Iookalikes, you know.

13:21.101 --> 13:23.303
Yeah, but you know your own.

13:23.303 --> 13:26.172
At least I thought
you did, until tonight.

13:26.172 --> 13:27.774
Hon...

13:27.774 --> 13:29.935
let it go.

13:35.281 --> 13:38.685
You're a good man,
Bill Weiderman.

13:38.685 --> 13:41.354
I just hate seeing you
look so tired, though.

13:41.354 --> 13:44.224
You just hurry up
and get an idea, you.

13:44.224 --> 13:46.715
(laughs):
I'm trying.

13:54.768 --> 13:57.103
I'll be up as soon
as I finish this for Jeff.

13:57.103 --> 13:58.705
-(groans with disappointment)
-I know.

13:58.705 --> 14:01.207
I haven't seen this one
for a while.

14:01.207 --> 14:03.042
(sighs):
Besides, I...

14:03.042 --> 14:05.278
I can't sleep.

14:05.278 --> 14:07.580
I know.

14:07.580 --> 14:11.518
But maybe I'll still be awake
when you decide to come up.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.315
That would be nice.

14:18.224 --> 14:20.419
(gunshot, yelling)

14:28.334 --> 14:30.325
(groans)

14:39.345 --> 14:41.677
(thunder crashing)

14:43.817 --> 14:45.985
TV ANNOUNCER:
In just a moment, we'll be back

14:45.985 --> 14:48.317
with Spider's Kiss.

14:49.989 --> 14:52.321
(rain pattering)

14:53.860 --> 14:59.132
(quietly):
Bill?

14:59.132 --> 15:01.430
Come on, it's after 2:00.

15:07.040 --> 15:10.134
Come on, honey,
it's time to go to...

15:24.924 --> 15:26.824
Bill, wake up.

15:32.665 --> 15:34.634
(Katie gasps)

15:34.634 --> 15:37.003
God...

15:37.003 --> 15:38.905
(rain continues falling)

15:38.905 --> 15:42.141
(sobbing):
Oh, no, not now.

15:42.141 --> 15:46.079
Please... don't leave me.

15:46.079 --> 15:48.515
Oh, Bill...

15:48.515 --> 15:50.346
Oh, no.

15:51.518 --> 15:56.389
Not now, Bill,
please, I need you.

15:56.389 --> 16:00.326
(continues sobbing):
I love you so much.

16:00.326 --> 16:03.227
-(thunder crashing in distance)
-Oh, no...

16:06.065 --> 16:09.034
(sobbing):
Oh, don't leave me now...

16:11.104 --> 16:13.095
(continues sobbing)

16:16.776 --> 16:18.778
(birds chirping)

16:18.778 --> 16:21.747
(indistinct chatter in distance)

16:28.555 --> 16:31.547
(indistinct chatter continues)

16:33.860 --> 16:36.090
-POLLY: Hi, Mom.
-(knocking)

16:37.730 --> 16:38.932
Oh, hi, sweetheart.

16:38.932 --> 16:40.700
I was just on my way in.

16:40.700 --> 16:43.803
I was finishing up a thank-you
note to your Aunt Lois.

16:43.803 --> 16:46.539
I love you so much, Mom.

16:46.539 --> 16:47.870
Oh...

16:49.042 --> 16:51.844
Polly, I am so happy for you.

16:51.844 --> 16:53.413
Jack is a good man.

16:53.413 --> 16:56.576
Oh, thank you for letting me
get married in our home.

16:58.952 --> 17:02.322
Pol, I wouldn't have
had it any other way.

17:02.322 --> 17:04.757
And I'm glad...

17:04.757 --> 17:07.193
that we chose this day.

17:07.193 --> 17:09.395
Because it's right.

17:09.395 --> 17:11.761
You still miss him, don't you?

17:13.232 --> 17:14.995
Every day.

17:16.502 --> 17:21.674
You'd think after ten years that
the hurt would go away, but...

17:21.674 --> 17:24.510
but now we're going to have
your anniversary

17:24.510 --> 17:27.113
to celebrate
on the day of his death,

17:27.113 --> 17:30.650
and Ijust know
it's gonna ease the pain.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.085
(sighs)

17:32.085 --> 17:35.521
Oh... why don't you come on out
and have some champagne?

17:35.521 --> 17:37.490
Jack wants to dance with you.

17:37.490 --> 17:38.825
(both laugh)

17:38.825 --> 17:40.259
All right, sweetheart.

17:40.259 --> 17:43.563
I just want to put a stamp
on this letter to Lois, okay?

17:43.563 --> 17:44.587
Okay.

17:59.112 --> 18:01.842
(indistinct chatter continues
in distance)

18:42.088 --> 18:44.157
KATIE (distorted):
...together.

18:44.157 --> 18:46.993
...run it by Bill.

18:46.993 --> 18:49.495
He doesn't feel well...

18:49.495 --> 18:52.699
He's always like that
in between books...

18:52.699 --> 18:54.567
He can't sleep,
and he thinks every headache's

18:54.567 --> 18:56.269
the first sign of a brain tumor.

18:56.269 --> 18:58.905
(gasps)

18:58.905 --> 19:01.669
I want to tape Spider's Kiss,
but Connie won't let me.

19:03.076 --> 19:05.878
I do not think this is the time
for sibling rivalry, okay?

19:05.878 --> 19:07.180
(sobbing)

19:07.180 --> 19:09.949
It was Dad's first book.
Don't you even care?

19:09.949 --> 19:12.018
(sobbing)

19:12.018 --> 19:13.252
Connie!

19:13.252 --> 19:14.887
(continues sobbing)

19:14.887 --> 19:16.878
I don't like having my children
so far away from me.

19:20.960 --> 19:23.229
There's always Bill,
isn't there?

19:23.229 --> 19:25.231
(sighs deeply)

19:25.231 --> 19:27.600
(indistinct chatter continues
in distance)

19:27.600 --> 19:29.534
(moans softly)

19:37.376 --> 19:40.209
I'm gonna put you on hold, Lois.

19:41.414 --> 19:42.915
(sobbing):
Oh...

19:42.915 --> 19:45.418
Ta... Take...

19:45.418 --> 19:47.153
Please take...

19:47.153 --> 19:49.388
Polly, is that you?
Honey, it's Mom.

19:49.388 --> 19:52.058
(sobbing):
Oh, quick, please...

19:52.058 --> 19:53.159
Now, honey, calm down.

19:53.159 --> 19:55.059
Whatever it is,
it can't be that...

19:56.329 --> 19:58.397
Take him to the hospital!

19:58.397 --> 20:01.200
He's gonna have a heart attack!

20:01.200 --> 20:02.468
He's gonna...

20:02.468 --> 20:06.038
have a... heart attack!

20:06.038 --> 20:09.132
Please, take... take...

20:12.478 --> 20:14.213
(gasps)

20:14.213 --> 20:17.884
(indistinct chatter continues
in distance)

20:17.884 --> 20:20.478
I dialed the old number.

20:22.421 --> 20:24.457
I dialed the old number.

20:24.457 --> 20:25.758
So it was a prank--

20:25.758 --> 20:30.296
somebody crying so hard,
they dialed the wrong number,

20:30.296 --> 20:32.131
It was not a prank, Bill!

20:32.131 --> 20:33.666
And it was not a wrong number.

20:33.666 --> 20:35.268
It was someone in my family...

20:35.268 --> 20:37.828
(echo fading):
...family, family, family...

20:39.238 --> 20:40.439
(line rings)

20:40.439 --> 20:42.074
-(beeping)
-RECORDED VOICE: We're sorry,

20:42.074 --> 20:44.844

20:44.844 --> 20:47.480
If you feel you have reached

21:01.494 --> 21:02.893

21:23.049 --> 21:25.818
Waiting for us to enter.

21:25.818 --> 21:29.322
Waiting to enter us.

21:29.322 --> 21:35.454
Until next time, try
to enjoy the daylight.
