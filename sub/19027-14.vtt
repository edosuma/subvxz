00:02.792 --> 00:04.333
(J.D.) <i>It was a beautiful day,</i>

00:04.417 --> 00:08.250
<i>so I invited Elliot over to my half</i>
<i>acre for some friendly sun bathing.</i>

00:09.250 --> 00:11.583
<i>Unfortunately, she brought Keith.</i>

00:11.667 --> 00:13.083
Thanks for doing that, J.D.

00:13.166 --> 00:15.959
I'd do it myself, but the bopsy
twins are already loose.

00:16.041 --> 00:18.458
No worries. It's not that
homoerotic, is it?

00:18.542 --> 00:20.542
Oh, God, no.

00:21.667 --> 00:23.750
(J.D.) <i>Keith didn't know</i>
<i>I mildly disliked him.</i>

00:24.333 --> 00:26.959
<i>He also didn't know I was rubbing</i>
<i>Crisco on his back.</i>

00:29.667 --> 00:31.542
Does it smell like pie crust?

00:31.625 --> 00:33.709
That's the rhododendron, Keith.

00:33.792 --> 00:36.709
Everybody knows they smell
like pie when they bloom.

00:36.792 --> 00:40.291
-Hey, nice new watch, J.D.
-Thank you.

00:40.375 --> 00:41.542
(J.D.) <i>It wasn't a watch.</i>

00:41.625 --> 00:43.500
<i>Now that Elliot had</i>
<i>gotten serious with Keith,</i>

00:43.583 --> 00:45.208
<i>I needed to get</i>
<i>tighter with Turk.</i>

00:45.291 --> 00:48.458
<i>And since he's so busy being married</i>
<i>and trying to make a baby,</i>

00:48.542 --> 00:49.709
<i>I had only one option.</i>

00:49.792 --> 00:52.333
-Come in, Brown Bear.
-(J.D.)<i> I got us watchy talkies.</i>

00:52.417 --> 00:55.750
-Hey, White Shadow.
-(J.D.) <i>That's not my handle.</i>

00:57.375 --> 00:58.625
Hey, Gizmo.

00:58.709 --> 01:00.625
Right on. What are you doing, man?

01:00.709 --> 01:03.041
I'm about to take out
the slip 'n' slide. Let's do it.

01:03.458 --> 01:05.625
Dude, I can't.
It's baby-making time.

01:05.709 --> 01:06.917
How's it going with Keith?

01:07.542 --> 01:08.917
Awesome. Check this.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.458
(sizzling)

01:11.542 --> 01:14.542
Bacon back. Classic.

01:14.625 --> 01:17.875
Hey, stud, you ready
to fertilize an egg?

01:19.125 --> 01:22.959
Got to go. Maintain radio silence
on all channels.

01:24.750 --> 01:26.583
(J.D.) <i>A local magazine</i>
<i>named Dr. Cox</i>

01:26.667 --> 01:28.083
<i>the best doctor in the city.</i>

01:28.458 --> 01:30.291
<i>Dr. Cox felt this was big news.</i>

01:30.375 --> 01:33.000
All right, here's how
it's going to work, people.

01:33.083 --> 01:35.375
I'm going to ask each
and every one of you

01:35.458 --> 01:39.375
just exactly who is the very finest
physician in this city,

01:39.458 --> 01:41.959
to which you will respond,
you are.

01:42.792 --> 01:46.041
If you do not reply in a timely
and exuberant fashion,

01:46.125 --> 01:47.959
my associate here will take his
mop--

01:48.041 --> 01:50.458
and these are his words, not mine--
popsicle you.

01:51.041 --> 01:53.458
Now, my lovely ex-wife
will demonstrate.

01:53.542 --> 01:55.333
Darling, just exactly who

01:55.417 --> 01:57.834
is the very best physician
in our fair city?

01:57.917 --> 02:01.166
You are. And now, as agreed,
you owe me a night on the town

02:01.250 --> 02:03.375
and to me actually getting to finish
sex.

02:03.458 --> 02:05.917
Well done. Now, here down the line
we go.

02:06.041 --> 02:07.041
-You are.
-You are.

02:07.125 --> 02:08.500
-You are.
-Y'ar.

02:08.583 --> 02:10.500
God! Why?

02:10.583 --> 02:13.125
You combined "you" and "are."
You said "y'ar." Made no sense.

02:13.208 --> 02:16.083
It's true, Lonnie. Everybody heard
it. Poke him again.

02:16.166 --> 02:19.917
-Eeh!
-Bob Kelso, will you be joining us?

02:20.000 --> 02:21.667
Hmm? There was a line.

02:21.750 --> 02:23.875
I assumed it had something
to do with cupcakes.

02:23.959 --> 02:26.166
Bob, obviously,
you read the article.

02:26.250 --> 02:28.333
Perry, the last publication I read
was the issue

02:28.417 --> 02:30.041
of out my son left by the crapper

02:30.125 --> 02:31.959
when he was home this
weekend asking for money.

02:32.041 --> 02:33.834
You'll never get my validation,
hot shot.

02:35.083 --> 02:36.917
And just exactly
where was the poke?

02:37.625 --> 02:38.792
I froze.

02:38.875 --> 02:40.792
Give me another 20 bucks,
I'll go crack him over the head.

02:40.875 --> 02:42.041
Only kill him if you have to.

02:45.125 --> 02:48.250
That was amazing, baby.
I never felt so close to you.

02:48.333 --> 02:50.417
Oh, me, too.

02:51.083 --> 02:52.500
(sighs)

02:53.500 --> 02:54.500
Turk.

02:57.792 --> 02:59.458
Were you not done
cuddling, honey?

02:59.875 --> 03:02.709
Because I was thinking maybe we
could go over to J.D.'s half acre,

03:02.792 --> 03:04.083
put a blanket down.

03:04.583 --> 03:06.333
You can lie in my lap
while I stroke your hair.

03:06.417 --> 03:09.083
-Real reason, Turk.
-J.D. has a slip 'n' slide.

03:09.166 --> 03:11.000
I wanna show off some of my slammin'
new moves.

03:11.083 --> 03:12.667
I call this the captain.

03:13.250 --> 03:15.500
Right? And then-- wait. The dolphin.

03:15.583 --> 03:17.083
(squeaking)

03:17.166 --> 03:19.083
I swear, Turk, sometimes I think you
and J.D.

03:19.166 --> 03:20.959
are more of a couple than we are.

03:22.166 --> 03:24.041
(J.D.)<i> Tell her I've known you</i>
<i>longer.</i>

03:24.125 --> 03:25.291

I just don't usually

03:44.375 --> 03:47.000
Don't worry. Later,
I'm gonna find some aloe

03:47.083 --> 03:49.750
and rub it on wherever it hurts.

03:50.583 --> 03:52.166
It's just on my back really.

03:52.250 --> 03:55.083
Keith, that was innuendo.
You were gonna work on this.

03:55.166 --> 03:57.500
Oh, r-r-r-right. Okay. Um...

03:58.834 --> 04:01.667
It also hurts under my pants--
in my pants.

04:01.750 --> 04:03.959
Damn it. I can't get this.

04:04.041 --> 04:06.208
Sweetie, you'll get it.
You'll get it.

04:10.458 --> 04:12.583
What? Laverne, what?

04:12.667 --> 04:14.583
No judgment here, child.

04:14.667 --> 04:17.166
(J.D.) <i>People were starting to talk</i>
<i>about Elliot and Keith.</i>

04:17.250 --> 04:19.583
<i>But I decided to stay</i>
<i>above the fray.</i>

04:19.667 --> 04:21.917
<i>Then I changed my mind.</i>

04:22.000 --> 04:23.834
Can you believe those two?

04:23.917 --> 04:26.834
No, I can't. All that
carrying on in public.

04:26.917 --> 04:29.917
-It's way too much.
-It's just too much.

04:30.417 --> 04:32.417
Sorry. I switched places
so I could go again.

04:32.500 --> 04:34.166
-Dr. Dorian?
-Yes, Rex.

04:34.500 --> 04:36.500
Mrs. Levin won't take her
medication.

04:36.583 --> 04:40.166
Mrs. Levin has dementia, Rex,
and I know she loves sweets.

04:40.250 --> 04:43.000
So take the pill, put it
in some raspberry jam,

04:43.083 --> 04:46.250
put it on your finger,
dip it in her mouth. Hello!

04:46.333 --> 04:48.250
(J.D.)<i> Rex would</i>
<i>forever remember that morning</i>

04:48.333 --> 04:50.250
<i>as the time he lost his fingertip.</i>

04:50.333 --> 04:52.291
<i>With patients,</i>
<i>it's the luck of the draw.</i>

04:52.625 --> 04:54.625
<i>You can't choose</i>
<i>how tolerant they are.</i>

04:54.709 --> 04:56.542
Young man,
can you make sure

04:56.625 --> 04:58.792
they don't give me
any black blood?

04:59.208 --> 05:00.375
I'll try.

05:01.875 --> 05:03.792
(J.D.) <i>You can't choose</i>
<i>how classy they are.</i>

05:03.875 --> 05:06.667
Oh, your hernia stitches look great,
Mr. Borland.

05:06.750 --> 05:08.750
Could you give them a kiss?

05:08.834 --> 05:10.083
Maybe later.

05:11.750 --> 05:14.000
(J.D.) <i>Bottom line, you can't choose</i>
<i>your patients.</i>

05:14.083 --> 05:16.166
-Hello.
-It's about time.

05:16.709 --> 05:19.291
-Are you my doctor?
-Yes, I am.

05:19.375 --> 05:21.208
I'm gonna go ahead
and give you a second

05:21.291 --> 05:24.000
so you can think about just how
lucky that makes you.

05:24.083 --> 05:25.834
Don't try to be funny.

05:26.750 --> 05:29.458
Here's a list of things I'm gonna
need you to take care of.

05:30.125 --> 05:33.250
That is so helpful.
Let me take a look at this.

05:37.625 --> 05:38.625
Hey.

05:38.959 --> 05:40.375
Hey. When you coming over tonight?

05:40.458 --> 05:41.917
I can't. I'm on call.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
I'm really worried about a patient
with metastatic adenoid carcinoma.

05:46.709 --> 05:48.667
See, this is why I hate cancer.

05:48.750 --> 05:51.291
-(whistles) Listen up.
-You are!

05:51.375 --> 05:53.333
We're not doing that anymore.

05:54.208 --> 05:56.875
Now, you're fairly strong
at diagnosing, right?

05:56.959 --> 05:58.125
-Yes, sir.
-Terrific.

05:58.208 --> 05:59.959
I need you to go up and figure out

06:00.041 --> 06:02.375
what's wrong with that darn
third-floor coffee machine.

06:02.458 --> 06:06.458
And, Gandroo, I need you to talk to
a young pregnant black girl

06:06.542 --> 06:07.959
who will not let me call her mom.

06:08.041 --> 06:09.500
Why would she listen to me?

06:09.583 --> 06:12.917
I may have told her
that you're Kanye West.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.875
I'm actually all right with that.

06:14.959 --> 06:16.333
Let's go, group.

06:18.125 --> 06:20.458
Look at our 3 manly men.

06:20.959 --> 06:24.458
-Perry gets his chest waxed.
-Keith loves to knit throw pillows.

06:24.542 --> 06:27.250
-Turk might be sterile.
-We have a winner.

06:27.333 --> 06:30.125
I can't get pregnant
and I already got a fertility test.

06:30.208 --> 06:32.208
So why don't you
just ask him to get tested?

06:32.291 --> 06:35.291
Turk is very sensitive when it comes
to his manliness.

06:35.375 --> 06:38.083
Remember when I told him his
backpack looked like a purse?

06:39.375 --> 06:41.959
Turk, honey, I didn't mean it.

06:42.583 --> 06:46.583
I am a man and a man does not
carry a purse!

06:47.000 --> 06:49.875
Aah-aah-aah! Aah-aah!

06:50.625 --> 06:52.625
Yeah, ah, ah, ah.

06:52.709 --> 06:54.291
So if you can't ask him to get
tested,

06:54.375 --> 06:55.375
what the hell are you gonna do?

06:55.458 --> 06:58.166
That's easy.
I'm gonna sperm-jack him.

06:58.792 --> 06:59.792
Sure, sure.

07:00.875 --> 07:03.792
All right, everyone, I just made a
little tweak to the schedule.

07:03.875 --> 07:06.250
Lisa, you're on tonight
and Keith is off

07:06.333 --> 07:09.000
because he's got some hospital
related business to tend to.

07:09.083 --> 07:10.125
(scoffs)

07:10.208 --> 07:11.709
Hey, don't give me that look, Lisa.

07:11.792 --> 07:13.208
You'd be off if you had a good
reason.

07:13.291 --> 07:14.959
Like if you and I were sleeping
together?

07:15.041 --> 07:17.375
First of all, the only
woman in this hospital

07:17.458 --> 07:21.333
that I would even consider sleeping
with is Jamie in pediatrics.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.375
-Ohh!
-I know.

07:24.333 --> 07:27.417
And secondly, I'm the attending.
So tough took us.

07:31.333 --> 07:34.417
-Wow.
-It's just so unfair.

07:34.792 --> 07:38.208
-So unfair.
-It really is unfair, you guys.

07:38.542 --> 07:41.500
Hey, Gizmo.
Can you check on Mr. Jensen for me?

07:41.583 --> 07:44.542
No problem, Brown Bear.
Are you nude right now?

07:44.625 --> 07:46.917
Yeah. How did you know?

07:47.000 --> 07:49.083
Your voice is always
higher when you're nude.

07:50.083 --> 07:51.083
That's true.

07:51.458 --> 07:53.291
It's not weird that
you know that at all?

07:53.375 --> 07:55.959
Bob, just a note about the tapioca.

07:56.041 --> 07:59.375
-I'm much more partial to flan.
-You're a flan fan.

07:59.458 --> 08:01.000
It's fun to say, more fun to eat.

08:01.083 --> 08:04.375
Anyway, anything that you need,
you just ask Dr. Cox.

08:04.458 --> 08:06.709
Perry, Bonnie here is an old friend.

08:06.792 --> 08:09.041
-Can't say I'm shocked.
-Take care of her.

08:09.125 --> 08:11.083
You can count on me, Bob-o.

08:12.417 --> 08:13.417
Here's the low-down.

08:13.875 --> 08:15.125
In 3 hours, my shift ends,

08:15.208 --> 08:18.041
at which point I will be leaving you
and meeting with my ex-wife

08:18.125 --> 08:20.792
for a celebratory
"best doctor in this city" date

08:20.875 --> 08:24.291
which is guaranteed
to end in crazy hotel sex.

08:24.792 --> 08:28.792
I'm thinking 6-inch heels,
a leather mask, fishnet stockings.

08:29.500 --> 08:32.000
Who knows?
She may even get dressed up.

08:32.083 --> 08:33.250
Good news for you, though,

08:33.333 --> 08:36.125
is that you have a simple case
of hypocalcemia.

08:36.917 --> 08:38.500
Any trained monkey can treat it.

08:38.875 --> 08:40.375
Let's see who that monkey's gonna
be.

08:41.542 --> 08:42.792
Ooh, banana.

08:44.667 --> 08:46.417
Rex it is.
Have a great night.

08:46.500 --> 08:48.500
You're in very capable
9-fingered hands.

08:52.083 --> 08:56.333
I don't know what's gotten into you,
baby, but I am turned on.

08:57.375 --> 09:00.125
Ok, baby, this might feel
a little bit weird,

09:00.208 --> 09:03.166
but I promise you, you will love it.

09:04.959 --> 09:09.458
Honey, how could you think I
wouldn't notice this on my dangle?

09:10.000 --> 09:13.792
You were enjoying it until it
started making that grinding noise.

09:14.542 --> 09:16.375
I know we're having
a hard time getting pregnant...

09:17.417 --> 09:19.709
but, sweetness, it could be you.

09:20.333 --> 09:22.000
I already got tested.

09:24.041 --> 09:25.041
Oh.

09:26.166 --> 09:29.500
-Turk.
-I'm a man...

09:29.959 --> 09:32.375
and men can make babies!

09:35.333 --> 09:36.458
I'm not afraid to tell you, Jordan,

09:36.542 --> 09:40.208
I think it's gonna be a hell of a
night. I got us a penthouse.

09:40.291 --> 09:42.125
Great. How much did that run you?

09:42.208 --> 09:44.417
About 5 bucks. And I figured
while I'm in the shower,

09:44.500 --> 09:46.041
you can read it
and get yourself revved up.

09:46.125 --> 09:48.709
-Awesome.
-What the hell, mongo?

09:49.417 --> 09:50.875
I'm sorry. I'm his man now.

09:50.959 --> 09:52.125
Hello, Perry.

09:52.750 --> 09:54.667
Don't get me wrong.
I hit him hard twice.

09:54.750 --> 09:55.750
It just made him mad.

09:56.458 --> 09:58.667
The guy's got a skull
like a mountain goat.

10:01.875 --> 10:04.792
Perry, when I told you
to treat Mrs. Cooke, I meant it.

10:04.875 --> 10:06.500
If I wanted to waste my breath,

10:06.583 --> 10:08.500
I would have given my wife
mouth-to-mouth last night

10:08.583 --> 10:09.875
when she went into cardiac arrest.

10:09.959 --> 10:12.208
She's ok.
My mistress used to be a lifeguard.

10:12.667 --> 10:15.875
-Now, get your ass back in there.
-I'm sorry, babe.

10:15.959 --> 10:18.041
It looks like we're gonna have to
take a rain check.

10:18.375 --> 10:20.041
I know. You are.

10:21.208 --> 10:22.875
-Enjoy your evening, ma'am.
-Thank you.

10:23.834 --> 10:25.625
No can do.

10:26.792 --> 10:29.000
-Hey, we're gonna get going.
-No, no, no.

10:29.083 --> 10:32.291
There is no way that you can just
spring your little boy toy here

10:32.375 --> 10:35.166
for a night of passionless passion
while my ass is stuck here

10:35.250 --> 10:36.417
and Jordan's in a hotel

10:36.500 --> 10:38.500
somewhere whispering sweet nothings
to a shower nozzle.

10:38.583 --> 10:39.625
Uh...

10:40.667 --> 10:41.917
I'm gonna hang out back here.

10:42.625 --> 10:44.375
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.

10:44.458 --> 10:46.750
We'll leave it up to your interns.
(whistles)

10:47.417 --> 10:50.834
Who here doesn't think that Barbie
should abuse her power?

10:52.625 --> 10:55.291
Ah. There we go.
Fair and square.

10:55.375 --> 10:56.500
I'm afraid jock stays.

10:57.917 --> 10:59.291
(J.D.)<i> It's a strange feeling</i>

10:59.375 --> 11:02.709
<i>when everyone's stuck in hell</i>
<i>and you're not.</i>

11:04.041 --> 11:05.125
I might be sterile?

11:05.208 --> 11:08.083
Oh, honey, stay calm.
Nobody knows but us.

11:08.166 --> 11:10.333
(J.D.)<i> You're firing blanks, buddy?</i>

11:10.834 --> 11:13.083
Oh! (sobbing)

11:13.166 --> 11:15.000
(J.D.)<i> I was just glad to watch TV</i>

11:15.083 --> 11:17.500
<i>and for once not be</i>
<i>in a world of crap.</i>

11:19.834 --> 11:21.083
Why didn't you stand up for me?

11:21.166 --> 11:22.166
<i>Or not.</i>

11:22.875 --> 11:24.959
Attendings switch schedules
all the time, J.D.

11:25.041 --> 11:26.792
You switched last week,
and I totally attended you.

11:27.667 --> 11:30.208
You know what's really going on
here? You don't like Keith.

11:30.291 --> 11:31.917
Go ahead. Tell me I'm wrong.

11:33.959 --> 11:36.667
Thanks, J.D. You're a great friend.

11:42.250 --> 11:45.750
-(Turk) <i>At least you're not sterile.</i>
-Amen to that, C Bear.

11:50.917 --> 11:52.709
(J.D.) <i>The next morning I braced</i>
<i>myself</i>

11:52.792 --> 11:54.625
<i>for Elliot's odd brand of revenge.</i>

11:57.291 --> 11:58.500
<i>And there it was.</i>

11:59.125 --> 12:02.041
Did you individually drain
all my eggs?

12:02.125 --> 12:03.291
Morning.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.875
Fine. I'll just have an apple.

12:08.250 --> 12:09.542
Oh, looking for this?

12:14.834 --> 12:17.166
-How did you do that?
-(door slams)

12:18.625 --> 12:20.709
I'm having a rough morning,
Brown Bear.

12:20.792 --> 12:22.875
How you doing with your sterility?

12:22.959 --> 12:26.125
Uh, can't really talk about that
right now. I'm in an elevator.

12:26.208 --> 12:27.875
(J.D.)<i> Not reading you, Brown Bear.</i>

12:27.959 --> 12:30.792
<i>I repeat: Are you still sterile?</i>

12:30.875 --> 12:33.500
This is so juicy, I feel dizzy.

12:35.750 --> 12:37.583
Stupid watchy talkie.

12:40.291 --> 12:43.208
I heard they really wanna have
children, but they can't 'cause he--

12:43.291 --> 12:44.667
(all gasp)

12:47.458 --> 12:50.208
Don't worry, baby.
I'll kick her ass for you later.

12:50.667 --> 12:52.792
We can go to the fertility clinic
after work.

12:52.875 --> 12:54.458
I can handle this myself.

12:54.542 --> 12:57.542
Besides, when you went to get your
fertility test, you didn't take me.

12:57.625 --> 12:59.709
-Are you sure?
-Yeah. Yeah.

12:59.792 --> 13:03.500
Besides, I've been giving the fellas
some inspirational pep talks.

13:05.417 --> 13:06.750
Got to want it, boys.

13:07.500 --> 13:08.959
There's no I in sperm.

13:12.333 --> 13:15.625
Hey, you get a patient
with gelastic seizures.

13:16.875 --> 13:19.792
Awesome.
Every intern wanted this case.

13:21.625 --> 13:23.500
Elliot, you're asking for trouble.

13:23.583 --> 13:25.166
-Everybody's already talking.
-Mm-hmm.

13:25.250 --> 13:26.834
Keith is the best intern.

13:26.917 --> 13:29.041
He shouldn't be punished just
because he has to sleep with me.

13:29.125 --> 13:33.208
-Has to?
-Gets to-- he gets to sleep with me.

13:33.959 --> 13:35.375
(sighs) As a woman,

13:35.458 --> 13:37.875
have you ever noticed how old
self-esteem issues

13:37.959 --> 13:39.083
just creep up on you?

13:39.166 --> 13:40.917
I have sausage fingers.

13:41.667 --> 13:44.083
Do you remember when I pulled
strings with the board

13:44.166 --> 13:45.375
and got Perry that promotion?

13:46.208 --> 13:47.583
Yeah. People started talking,

13:47.667 --> 13:49.917
and Perry ended up totally
emasculated.

13:50.375 --> 13:51.875
So it worked out great for me.

13:53.083 --> 13:56.333
I should not care what other people
think. Right, Carla?

13:57.750 --> 14:00.667
Oh, sweetie, they're beautiful.

14:01.291 --> 14:02.709
They're kielbasas.

14:11.834 --> 14:14.083
(J.D.) Come in, Brown Bear.
Come in, Brown Bear.

14:15.458 --> 14:18.458
If you're around, I'm having
some java out front.

14:29.458 --> 14:32.125
Ohh! I'm hit. I'm hit.

14:32.875 --> 14:35.291
Oh, this is gonna be fantastic.

14:39.458 --> 14:40.834
All right, look,

14:40.917 --> 14:43.792
I know I said I wanted to go by
myself to get tested today,

14:43.875 --> 14:48.875
but I've been doing some thinking,
and I'm scared.

14:48.959 --> 14:52.417
So... it would mean a lot
if you went with me.

14:53.333 --> 14:54.583
Of course, buddy.

14:55.500 --> 14:58.000
You know I'm not comfortable
getting busy with myself.

14:58.083 --> 15:01.166
Well, you're in luck.
This happens to be my specialty.

15:01.250 --> 15:02.583
Here's some tips.

15:02.667 --> 15:05.000
If you can't get over the fact
that you're doing it to yourself,

15:05.083 --> 15:07.083
sit on your arm
until it falls asleep.

15:07.166 --> 15:11.709
Then pull it out and use that.
I call it the stranger.

15:11.792 --> 15:15.208
If I ever have kids,
you are never allowed to baby-sit.

15:15.291 --> 15:17.125
I can't believe
you're ready to have kids.

15:17.208 --> 15:20.750
We spend all day taking care of old
people, washing them, cleaning them.

15:20.834 --> 15:22.000
Why would you wanna
bring that home?

15:22.083 --> 15:24.166
J.D., we're talking about kids,

15:24.250 --> 15:26.458
not going home to a houseful
of old folks.

15:28.041 --> 15:30.375
All right, fellas,
2 quick announcements.

15:30.458 --> 15:33.834
First of all, whoever's been filling
my TiVo with jag reruns,

15:33.917 --> 15:35.166
let's cut it out.

15:35.875 --> 15:38.542
And secondly, Harvey,
no matter how drunk you get,

15:38.625 --> 15:41.041
-I like to sleep alone.
-But I like to snuggle.

15:41.125 --> 15:43.542
That's your problem, buddy.
I got my own thing.

15:44.542 --> 15:47.458
Ok. Chris Turk?

15:48.083 --> 15:49.166
Yeah.

15:49.250 --> 15:50.500
We're ready for you.

15:53.125 --> 15:54.125
Excuse me.

15:54.208 --> 15:56.041
Are any of the reading
materials in there

15:56.125 --> 15:58.166
available for those of us out here?

16:00.250 --> 16:04.250
Hey, J.D., this is the black surgeon
that you always hang out with.

16:04.333 --> 16:06.834
Come on outside to the ramp, dog.

16:08.625 --> 16:12.333
Any second now.

16:14.792 --> 16:17.125
Oh, for God sake,
breathe through your nose.

16:17.208 --> 16:18.834
You sound like my bulldog.

16:20.083 --> 16:23.333
You know, as a doctor,
I rarely root for the disease.

16:23.417 --> 16:27.250
But with you I find myself
cheering, go hypocalcemia

16:27.333 --> 16:30.458
with an underlying M.E.N. Syndrome.
Go, go, go!

16:30.542 --> 16:32.375
Do you drink out of the toilet?

16:32.458 --> 16:34.458
My bulldog drinks out of the toilet.

16:34.542 --> 16:36.250
God almighty.

16:36.333 --> 16:37.417
God.

16:38.083 --> 16:41.417
Dr. Reid, we think it is lame

16:41.500 --> 16:43.125
that you give Keith
preferential treatment.

16:43.208 --> 16:45.542
We're filing a formal complaint
with Dr. Kelso.

16:45.625 --> 16:47.875
Oh. Ok. Sure. You know what?

16:47.959 --> 16:49.375
You guys can tell Kelso
whatever you want

16:49.458 --> 16:50.709
'cause all he's gonna do
is hear the facts.

16:50.792 --> 16:53.041
I'm sleeping with Keith,
he gets his schedule shifted,

16:53.125 --> 16:54.917
and he gets the most
interesting cases.

16:56.417 --> 16:57.959
Who wants 20 bucks?

16:59.709 --> 17:01.875
Well, that's not gonna work 'cause I
don't have that much money, so...

17:14.583 --> 17:15.792
(knocking)

17:15.875 --> 17:17.792
I just got in here.

17:20.375 --> 17:21.709
Baby, what are you doing here?

17:21.792 --> 17:24.166
I was home thinking
about my fertility test

17:24.250 --> 17:26.333
and how badly I wanted you
to be there with me.

17:27.667 --> 17:31.750
Baby, I'm a man
and we're not that vulnerable.

17:31.834 --> 17:34.250
I don't really know why
I didn't tell you about it.

17:34.917 --> 17:36.333
I guess I was just scared

17:36.417 --> 17:39.500
that if I got bad news,
I'd be letting you down.

17:40.583 --> 17:42.500
I could see
how you'd feel that way.

17:43.625 --> 17:46.041
Anyway, I thought I'd come over.

17:46.125 --> 17:48.250
Oh. Thanks, sweetie.

17:48.333 --> 17:52.417
But you might wanna go outside
'cause I'm about to fill this up.

17:52.500 --> 17:54.500
Why would I wait outside?

17:58.583 --> 17:59.667
That's what's up.

17:59.750 --> 18:00.750
That's what's up.

18:01.500 --> 18:03.083
Mmm!

18:03.750 --> 18:05.208
Mmm! Mmm!

18:06.917 --> 18:08.083
You are more than welcome

18:08.166 --> 18:09.834
to have your goon take both of my
thumbs

18:09.917 --> 18:11.709
and break 'em if you want to, Bob.

18:11.792 --> 18:17.000
But I am officially o-u-t, out.
I am out.

18:17.083 --> 18:19.625
I don't even see
how you can like that woman.

18:19.709 --> 18:20.875
I don't.

18:20.959 --> 18:22.959
She was married
to my best friend Richard.

18:23.458 --> 18:24.792
He died a few years back.

18:25.583 --> 18:27.917
You know the deal with friends.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.792
If they love 'em, you'll have to
love 'em whether you like it or not.

18:31.625 --> 18:33.667
(J.D.) Dr. Kelso, do you
really believe that,

18:33.750 --> 18:35.667
or are you just
saying that to look good?

18:36.417 --> 18:37.959
Who am I kidding?

18:38.041 --> 18:39.792
You don't care what anybody
thinks about you, do you?

18:40.709 --> 18:41.709
I got to tell you, though,

18:41.792 --> 18:44.250
you just gave me some good advice
about how to deal with Elliot.

18:45.458 --> 18:46.709
Goochy, goochy, goochy, goo.

18:48.417 --> 18:49.542
Can I fire him?

18:49.625 --> 18:50.959
Sleep on it.

18:52.458 --> 18:55.375
Say, one more thing
about devil lady in there.

18:56.625 --> 18:57.959
Why me?

18:58.625 --> 19:00.792
I know it's a minor condition,
Perry,

19:00.875 --> 19:03.208
but you know how things can turn.

19:03.291 --> 19:08.375
But you wanted me in there
because I'm the best what, Bob?

19:09.041 --> 19:11.542
-No.
-Say it, or I will go in there

19:11.625 --> 19:14.625
and tell her you're dying to be
with her a lot more often.

19:14.709 --> 19:16.458
(speaking gibberish)

19:16.542 --> 19:18.750
-Beg your pardon?
-You're the best doctor.

19:20.125 --> 19:21.125
Thank you, Bob.

19:22.208 --> 19:23.417
It means a lot to me.

19:26.583 --> 19:28.500
Listen. I know that
everyone is very upset,

19:28.583 --> 19:29.583
but I really don't think

19:29.667 --> 19:31.417
that there's any need to bother
Dr. Kelso.

19:32.125 --> 19:34.083
It's too late, Dr. Reid.

19:34.166 --> 19:36.583
You're right, Lisa. It is too late
because from now on,

19:36.667 --> 19:39.500
I'm gonna be handing out
all the case assignments.

19:39.583 --> 19:43.667
For instance,
this cool case right here.

19:43.750 --> 19:46.083
Should I give it to
the most annoying intern?

19:46.166 --> 19:47.250
'Cause that would
be you, Lisa.

19:47.875 --> 19:50.125
Or maybe I should give it to the
most incompetent intern

19:50.208 --> 19:52.417
missing a finger.
Because that would be you, Rex.

19:53.083 --> 19:55.917
Or maybe I should just
give it to the best intern...

19:56.750 --> 19:59.041
which would be you, Keith.

20:02.041 --> 20:06.041
Now, if anyone wants to tell on me
to whomever they like, they can.

20:06.875 --> 20:07.875
Good day.

20:08.583 --> 20:10.208
♪ <i>This is life </i>♪

20:11.125 --> 20:13.583

-Thanks again, Dr. D.

20:20.208 --> 20:22.375
All right. If you like him,
I like him.

20:24.583 --> 20:29.208
-Hey. I'm not sterile.
-Congratulations.

20:29.291 --> 20:31.792

<i>I could take solace in something.</i>

20:39.041 --> 20:42.834
Hey, Turk, I forgot.
I can't raid the freezer with you.

20:42.917 --> 20:45.417
<i>Be careful in there.</i>
<i>They lock up at 3:00.</i>

20:47.041 --> 20:49.959
