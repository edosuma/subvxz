11:23.349 --> 11:26.727
[all shouting]

11:41.742 --> 11:47.123
- I'LL TAKE PENNY.

11:47.206 --> 11:48.666
- LET'S SEE.

11:48.749 --> 11:50.793
UM...
HMM...

11:50.876 --> 11:54.046
- SO NANA SUGGESTED
SOLVANG FOR OUR VACATION,

11:54.130 --> 11:55.297
BUT I SAID,
"LET'S BRANCH OUT."

11:55.381 --> 11:59.051
- I'LL TAKE THAT GIRL
NEXT TO MILLIE.

11:59.135 --> 12:00.845
- UM, OKAY.

12:00.928 --> 12:02.096
I PICK...

12:02.179 --> 12:03.722

12:03.806 --> 12:04.265
ME-ME-ME!
ME! ME!

12:04.348 --> 12:05.474
ME! ME! ME!

12:05.558 --> 12:09.937
- NOT MILLIE
AND NOT BESSIE.

12:13.023 --> 12:14.608
- HMM.

12:14.692 --> 12:17.570
- MILLIE AND I
ARE OUR OWN TEAM.

12:17.653 --> 12:20.322
- UM, LET GWEN
FINISH HER SENTENCE.

12:20.406 --> 12:22.158
- [groans]
I GUESS I PICK MILLIE.

12:22.241 --> 12:27.204
- YES!

12:27.288 --> 12:28.247
- LOOKS LIKE I'M ON YOUR TEAM,
PORTIA.

12:28.330 --> 12:30.166
- [groans]

12:30.249 --> 12:32.168
- YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.

12:32.251 --> 12:33.169
- REALLY?

12:33.252 --> 12:35.296
HISTORY WOULD SUGGEST
OTHERWISE.

12:35.379 --> 12:37.673
- THAT WAS LAST YEAR.

12:37.756 --> 12:39.467
- AND THE YEAR BEFORE THAT,

12:39.550 --> 12:41.719
AND THE YEAR BEFORE THAT.

12:43.012 --> 12:46.182
[jaunty music]

12:46.265 --> 12:48.350
crash!

12:48.434 --> 12:50.019
- [grunts]

12:50.102 --> 12:51.854
thwack!

12:56.108 --> 12:57.568
WELL, THAT WAS BEFORE

12:57.651 --> 13:00.362
I DISCOVERED
I WAS A NATURAL ATHLETE.

13:00.446 --> 13:02.323
ALSO I HAVE
A NEW BOWLING BALL,

13:02.406 --> 13:04.074
AND I'VE BEEN DOING
BICEP CURLS.

13:13.125 --> 13:15.836
ONE PIN, TWO PINS,
THREE PINS, FOUR PINS,

13:15.920 --> 13:20.132
FIVE PINS, SIX PINS,
SEVEN PINS, EIGHT PINS.

13:20.216 --> 13:24.094

YES!

13:29.308 --> 13:32.978

13:38.275 --> 13:40.069

13:40.152 --> 13:41.403
SEVEN-TEN SPLIT.

13:41.487 --> 13:45.241
LIKE, WORST NIGHTMARE.

13:45.324 --> 13:47.451
- WELL,
I STILL GET ONE MORE BALL,

13:47.535 --> 13:48.285
SO I COULD PICK UP THE SPARE.

13:48.369 --> 13:50.663
LIKE I SAID,

13:50.746 --> 13:53.832
WHAT'S GOT TWO THUMBS
AND IS A NATURAL ATHLETE?

13:53.916 --> 13:54.333
THIS B.

13:54.416 --> 13:55.918
[whistles]

14:02.550 --> 14:05.052
[gulps]
EIGHT PINS DOWN.

14:05.135 --> 14:07.137
WHAT'S TWO MORE?

14:12.351 --> 14:13.435
[dinging]

14:13.519 --> 14:15.729
[blows raspberry]

14:17.273 --> 14:19.567
- SEE?
FAIL.

14:19.650 --> 14:21.944
- OKAY.
CAN ONLY GO UP FROM HERE.

14:26.031 --> 14:28.909
GAH!

14:28.993 --> 14:32.162
AGH!

14:32.246 --> 14:34.164
AH!

14:34.248 --> 14:35.165
GAH!

14:35.249 --> 14:38.127
whoosh!

14:38.210 --> 14:40.296
AGH!

14:46.302 --> 14:48.470
[groans]

15:04.612 --> 15:06.071
KNIVES AND FORKS.

15:06.155 --> 15:08.616
BUT THAT PLATE'S
MADE OUT OF HAIR...WHAT?

15:08.699 --> 15:09.408
[groans]

15:09.491 --> 15:11.410
WHAT IS THIS?

15:11.493 --> 15:13.370
A BOWLING AFTERLIFE?

15:13.454 --> 15:17.541
[ball rumbling]

15:17.625 --> 15:20.669
[pins scattering]

15:24.423 --> 15:26.342
[screams]

15:26.425 --> 15:29.887
[screaming]

15:29.970 --> 15:32.264
[screaming continues]

15:36.143 --> 15:37.186

15:38.771 --> 15:39.897
[pins scattering]

15:39.980 --> 15:41.690
[gasps]

15:41.774 --> 15:44.360
OH!

15:44.443 --> 15:45.277
[pins scattering]

15:45.361 --> 15:46.236
SEVEN-TEN SPLIT!

15:46.320 --> 15:48.614
WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?

15:48.697 --> 15:52.326
[screaming]

15:52.409 --> 15:54.203
SO THEN THE TEETH
STARTED CHASING ME,

15:54.286 --> 15:55.412
AND I TRIED TO SWIM AWAY,

15:55.496 --> 15:57.206
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE I WAS
FLOATING IN DREAM SPACE,

15:57.289 --> 15:59.500
AND I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT
IN MY DREAM-SWIMMING ABILITIES.

15:59.583 --> 16:00.501
BUT IT CAUGHT ME,

16:00.584 --> 16:03.087
AND THEN I WOKE UP
LAND-SWIMMING.

16:03.170 --> 16:04.880
PRETTY WEIRD, RIGHT?

16:04.963 --> 16:07.508
WHY DO YOU THINK MY MIND
WON'T LET ME BOWL?

16:07.591 --> 16:08.300
YOU'RE RIGHT.

16:08.384 --> 16:10.260
I SHOULD TRY DREAM ANALYSIS.

16:10.344 --> 16:12.638
THANKS FOR WEIGHING IN, HAPS.

16:15.974 --> 16:19.728
OKAY, DREAM ANALYSIS,
STEP ONE:

16:19.812 --> 16:20.396
GET MORE DREAMS.

16:20.479 --> 16:25.401
AND...SLEEP.

16:25.484 --> 16:27.236
AND SLEEP.

16:27.319 --> 16:28.821
SLEEP.

16:28.904 --> 16:30.364
NOW.

16:30.447 --> 16:31.407
NOW.
SLEEP NOW.

16:31.490 --> 16:32.408
NOW.
AND SLEEP.

16:32.491 --> 16:33.951
SLEEP.
SLEEP NOW.

16:34.034 --> 16:35.577
GO, NOW, AND SLEEP.

16:35.661 --> 16:39.248
SLEEP NOW.

16:39.331 --> 16:40.416
[sighs]

16:40.499 --> 16:42.126
FINE.

17:01.353 --> 17:02.396

17:03.272 --> 17:05.065
REMEMBER THAT RAIN CHECK I TOOK

17:05.148 --> 17:06.942
ON HEARING ABOUT

17:07.025 --> 17:08.819
WELL, I'M CASHING IT.

17:08.902 --> 17:10.112

- WELL, THIS IS USUALLY
ACCOMPANIED BY A SLIDESHOW,

17:12.823 --> 17:14.241
BUT IF YOU HAVE THE TIME,

17:14.324 --> 17:18.244
I CAN SIMPLY DESCRIBE
EACH IMAGE IN GREAT DETAIL.

17:18.328 --> 17:21.165
OKAY, READY?
GO.

17:21.248 --> 17:23.000
BEFORE I STARTED PACKING
FOR BARSTOW...

17:23.083 --> 17:28.130

ENTER SANDMAN IN THREE...

17:28.213 --> 17:30.215
[snores]

17:30.299 --> 17:33.218

17:58.285 --> 18:00.496
OH!

18:00.579 --> 18:02.122
GAH!

18:02.206 --> 18:03.832

18:03.916 --> 18:05.042
WAIT.
LOOK FOR MEANING.

18:05.125 --> 18:06.293

WHEW.

18:34.530 --> 18:36.532

[fabric ripping]

18:40.369 --> 18:41.286
AW, MAN!

18:41.370 --> 18:44.540

[baby laughing]

18:50.879 --> 18:54.341
AW, IT'S BABY ME.

18:54.424 --> 18:58.011
AND LOOK AT MY TEETH.

19:01.974 --> 19:04.768
- CHESTER AND I GOT INTO
AN ARGUMENT.

19:04.852 --> 19:08.230
HE WAS RIGHT ABOUT THE
CABLE-KNIT SWEATER BEING WARMER,

19:08.313 --> 19:10.732
BUT I JUST THINK
A CARDIGAN IS MORE VERSATILE.

19:10.816 --> 19:13.151
- NO!
BAD MILLIE!

19:13.235 --> 19:14.069
MY DREAM.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.821
WAIT.

19:15.904 --> 19:18.448
WHICH MEANS...CLENCH!

19:18.532 --> 19:21.285

19:58.196 --> 19:59.531
WHERE ARE OUR TEETH?

19:59.615 --> 20:01.533
WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO
WITH MY INABILITY TO BOWL?

20:01.617 --> 20:02.367
- [laughs]

20:02.451 --> 20:04.161
- COME ON.
YOU CAN TELL ME.

20:04.244 --> 20:04.703
I'M YOU.

20:04.786 --> 20:07.122

20:07.205 --> 20:08.290
- OH, I SHOULD STOP.

20:08.373 --> 20:10.876

20:20.093 --> 20:21.553
[grunts]
LET ME GO!

20:21.637 --> 20:22.679
I'LL REMEMBER THIS,
YOU CEILING FAN.

20:22.763 --> 20:27.476
JUST YOU WAIT.

20:27.559 --> 20:28.894
I HAVE TO GO BACK!

20:28.977 --> 20:30.270
- TO BARSTOW?

20:30.354 --> 20:32.105
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WENT.

20:32.189 --> 20:33.440
- SORRY, MILL.

20:33.523 --> 20:34.483

[pins scattering]

21:09.726 --> 21:10.936
WHOA!

21:11.019 --> 21:11.728

I WONDER HOW THEY GOT--

21:17.776 --> 21:21.446
OH!

21:21.530 --> 21:25.617
THIS EXPLAINS A LOT.

21:33.792 --> 21:34.543
I DID IT!

21:34.626 --> 21:37.504
REPRESSED MEMORY
CONQUERED.

21:37.587 --> 21:41.425
- GLEAM!

21:41.508 --> 21:43.385
- ALL RIGHT, BOWLING PINS,

21:43.468 --> 21:45.053
LET'S SEE IF THIS WORKS.

21:45.137 --> 21:47.806

STRIKE!

22:01.862 --> 22:06.158

22:06.241 --> 22:10.245
THE SEVEN-TEN CURSE
HAS BEEN LIFTED.

22:10.328 --> 22:11.997
- THERE YOU ARE.

22:12.080 --> 22:14.207
SO AS I WAS SAYING,

22:14.291 --> 22:17.919
BARSTOW HAS THE HIGHEST NUMBER
OF LAUNDROMATS PER CAPITA

22:18.003 --> 22:19.129
IN THE WHOLE STATE.

22:19.212 --> 22:22.090
IT'S HILARIOUS.
