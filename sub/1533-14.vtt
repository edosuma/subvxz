Yup. Just when I forgot how awkward it was
to walk in on you two.

You can get used to it again.

04:27.240 --> 04:29.322
I did a full medical workup
on the professor.

It turns out that now that
he and Ronnie are separated...

to harness nuclear energy.

- Yeah, if I was the one holding the controller.
-Meaning?

04:55.760 --> 04:58.206
Meaning you weren't
the most conscientious body-mate.

04:58.560 --> 05:02.406
So you do not consider keeping you alive
to be conscientious?

05:02.560 --> 05:05.040
Alive? We were living under a bridge
eating garbage.

that would have gotten us killed in that state.

You kept me buried down.
You kept me from her.

05:20.480 --> 05:23.768

08:02.840 --> 08:04.410

08:16.240 --> 08:18.208
BARRY:
The blood?

08:18.360 --> 08:21.170
Cisco and I had the DNA tested.

08:21.840 --> 08:23.080
It's yours.

08:24.800 --> 08:27.770
No, it's not. That's impossible.
I wasn't even downstairs yet.

08:27.920 --> 08:32.448
No, Barry, not that you. This you.

08:32.600 --> 08:34.090
Cisco had the samples analyzed...

08:34.320 --> 08:37.085
...and the proteins in the blood
were that of an adult...

08:37.280 --> 08:39.009
...not a child.

08:41.039 --> 08:42.121
But that means--

08:42.280 --> 08:44.521
The speedster trying to stop
the man in yellow--

08:44.680 --> 08:46.682

That's me.

08:55.160 --> 08:57.049
Time travel.

08:57.560 --> 09:02.248
If the last five months have proven anything,
it's that anything can exist.

09:02.440 --> 09:04.283
But to actually travel through time?

09:04.480 --> 09:06.960
Well, the greatest minds in human history...

09:07.160 --> 09:09.970
...put their collective genius towards
solving that puzzle.

09:10.120 --> 09:12.122
So is it possible?

09:12.640 --> 09:14.130
Yes, it's possible.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.482
But problematic. I mean...

09:16.640 --> 09:20.770
...assuming you could create the conditions
necessary to take that journey...

09:20.920 --> 09:23.571
...that journey would be fraught
with potential pitfalls.

09:23.720 --> 09:26.291
Novikov principle of self-consistency
for example--

09:26.440 --> 09:27.646
Wait, the what now?

09:27.800 --> 09:30.201
If you travel back in time
to change something...

09:30.400 --> 09:34.530
...then you end up being
the causal factor of that event.

09:34.760 --> 09:36.762
- Like Terminator.
-Ah.

09:37.400 --> 09:39.641
Or is time plastic? Is it mutable...

09:40.000 --> 09:43.447
...whereby any changes to the continuum
could create an alternate timeline?

09:44.160 --> 09:45.889

- Oh.

09:46.040 --> 09:50.648
- I saw that one too.
-"Doc Brown." Tremendous picture.

09:51.200 --> 09:53.601
Right. So, what's the answer?

09:54.120 --> 09:57.488
I might be a clever guy, but if you're
asking me to give you a theory...

09:57.640 --> 10:00.803
...on how to travel through time,
I'm afraid I just can't do that.

10:00.960 --> 10:03.531
There is someone else
you can talk to about this.

10:10.760 --> 10:12.250
Danish?

10:13.080 --> 10:16.766
Why do you have a blueprint
of the S.T.A.R. Labs' particle accelerator?

10:16.920 --> 10:20.641
- Do you know anything about physics?
-Not a thing. Might as well be in Dothraki.

10:20.800 --> 10:23.849
So, what more is there
with the S.T.A.R. Labs story?

10:24.040 --> 10:28.364
The only new information is Wells admitted
he was warned of a potential disaster.

10:28.840 --> 10:29.887
Yeah.

10:30.080 --> 10:31.969
Why do you think he did that?

10:32.960 --> 10:34.883
Because he's a good person?

10:35.040 --> 10:36.201
- Is he?
-Yes.

10:37.040 --> 10:38.724
He saved my friend's life.

10:38.880 --> 10:42.487
He was struck by lightning
and Dr. Wells and his team kept him alive.

10:42.640 --> 10:46.725
So your friend wouldn't need saving
if Wells hadn't zapped him in the first place.

10:47.720 --> 10:50.564
- It was an accident.
-What if it wasn't?

10:51.360 --> 10:54.887
So you think Harrison Wells wanted
the particle accelerator to explode?

10:55.560 --> 10:59.406
- Why would he do that?
-Don't know what goes on in that building.

10:59.640 --> 11:01.847
But I think you know some people who do.

11:02.160 --> 11:05.004
I'm gonna investigate my friends
because you got me a Danish?

11:05.200 --> 11:07.328
I think that you'll do it...

11:07.560 --> 11:11.246
...because you really wanna know
what goes on inside that building.

Well, after a year apart,
I'm not letting him out of my sight.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.971
S.T.A.R. Labs did quite a few tests on Martin,
didn't they?

11:34.120 --> 11:35.360
And they said he was fine?

11:36.040 --> 11:37.929
Yeah. Why? Something wrong?

- He just seems a little different, is all.
-Different how?

11:42.680 --> 11:46.048
He's been asking for pizza.
Martin despises pizza.

Is that the delivery man? Oh, Mr. Allen.

11:49.200 --> 11:52.044

you moonlight as a pizza boy.

What can I do for you?

12:10.880 --> 12:14.043
I needed to talk to you about a paper
that you wrote 25 years ago...

12:14.240 --> 12:15.890
...for the Oxford University Press?

12:16.080 --> 12:19.687
I have written many papers for that
publication. Could you be more specific?

12:19.920 --> 12:21.570
Time travel.

12:23.800 --> 12:27.168
These are just a few of the random thoughts
I've had on the subject.

12:27.360 --> 12:29.010
A few?

12:29.160 --> 12:32.209
See, I believe that space-time...

12:32.400 --> 12:37.201
...is a free-flowing highway
that intersects the physical world.

12:37.440 --> 12:41.126
We live in the moments
between the on and off ramps.

12:41.360 --> 12:43.283
Theoretically, to travel through time...

12:43.480 --> 12:46.529
...one merely needs to find a way
onto the highway.

12:46.680 --> 12:51.402
Okay. So you're saying that this is actually
possible, to travel into the future?

12:51.600 --> 12:53.204
Undoubtedly.

12:53.360 --> 12:54.691
What about the past?

12:54.840 --> 12:55.966
Yes.

12:56.160 --> 13:00.688
My own personal choice
would be the Chicago World's Fair, 1893.

13:00.920 --> 13:04.402
I think Nikola Tesla and I,
we'd have some wonderful arguments.

13:04.600 --> 13:09.128
What about you? Would you be interested
in taking a trip into history?

13:11.120 --> 13:14.169
