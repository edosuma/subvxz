WEBVTT

03:05.644 --> 03:07.354
How you doin', Pete?

03:07.438 --> 03:08.606
Good. You?

03:09.815 --> 03:10.815
I'm good.

03:15.529 --> 03:16.529
Got this?

03:17.448 --> 03:18.574
- Yeah?
- All right.

04:12.419 --> 04:13.671
How we doing?

04:15.923 --> 04:17.048
Hey, what's up?

04:58.841 --> 05:00.175
Take it easy.

07:10.347 --> 07:11.640
Everything cool?

07:13.517 --> 07:15.144
Everything's fucking beautiful.

07:30.242 --> 07:32.122
You know what
this fucking means for us?

07:32.161 --> 07:35.372
When he brings you in,
we're taking it all over, Moe.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.082
He's got no choice.

07:37.166 --> 07:39.246
Nobody can handle the weight
he's got coming through.

07:39.293 --> 07:41.086
You never know.

07:42.754 --> 07:44.465
He can be resourceful.

07:44.548 --> 07:46.300
No. No way.

07:46.383 --> 07:49.094
Not with the busts,
Necktalov getting popped.

07:49.178 --> 07:50.304
I'm his only option.

07:50.387 --> 07:52.347
You let him do the talking.

07:52.431 --> 07:53.974
You have something
he wants, right?

07:54.057 --> 07:55.057
Yeah, you.

07:55.100 --> 07:56.185
Well, that means us.

07:56.268 --> 07:58.270
I'll tell him I don't
do nothing without you.

08:01.690 --> 08:03.775
Moe, you're a fucking godsend.

08:14.369 --> 08:15.579
Hey, Unc.

08:15.662 --> 08:18.832
Hey.
Can you believe this view?

08:18.916 --> 08:21.376
You can't make
it on those streets,

08:21.460 --> 08:24.129
you can make it
anywhere in the world.

08:24.213 --> 08:26.882
So, you're really
gonna buy this building?

08:31.428 --> 08:34.890
We do this right.
It will be fully legitimate.

08:35.557 --> 08:37.476
Our money mixed with theirs.

08:38.727 --> 08:41.188
I'll be working for the city.

08:43.357 --> 08:45.984
Congressman Freed is a partner.

08:46.068 --> 08:47.945
There is no going back.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.572
- Yeah. All right.
- You get it done?

08:51.031 --> 08:52.366
Ah, yes.

09:01.166 --> 09:02.167
Good.

09:05.379 --> 09:09.049
So, what do you say
about two million a day

09:09.132 --> 09:10.634
for the next two weeks, huh?

09:11.927 --> 09:13.720
That's 20 million, yeah?

09:13.804 --> 09:15.138
Not a problem.

09:16.431 --> 09:19.601
And you don't even think
about it, like it's nothing?

09:19.685 --> 09:22.062
No, it's-it's something.

09:22.145 --> 09:23.313
Something big.

09:25.607 --> 09:28.527
I mean, you did say these last
few times were just a test.

09:29.111 --> 09:30.320
Right?

09:33.156 --> 09:34.283
Okay.

09:35.909 --> 09:38.620
So we start making
drops today, huh?

09:39.830 --> 09:40.872
All right.

09:41.957 --> 09:43.000
Yeah.

09:43.083 --> 09:46.211
Twenty million in 10
days is gonna be too much

09:46.295 --> 09:48.046
traffic coming through my place.

09:49.006 --> 09:49.923
And?

09:50.007 --> 09:51.842
What do you propose?

09:51.925 --> 09:52.925
Bobby?

09:54.845 --> 09:58.098
So, they text us a location, we
pick them up, we drop them off,

09:58.181 --> 10:00.434
they leave the money behind.

10:02.311 --> 10:06.481
So, you not fuck this up, and I
put a little more in your lap,

10:06.565 --> 10:07.649
huh?

10:07.733 --> 10:09.526
Well, no disrespect,
but I fuck this up

10:09.610 --> 10:11.153
and I don't think
it'll matter.

10:11.236 --> 10:12.654
Hey.

10:13.530 --> 10:15.574
Just use this fucking head!

10:20.162 --> 10:21.413
All right.

10:35.886 --> 10:38.180
"Use your fucking head."
Can you believe that shit?

10:38.972 --> 10:41.725
Twenty mil means you and I
split two mil, all right?

10:41.808 --> 10:43.018
That's all that matters.

11:32.734 --> 11:35.237
Hey. You
need to put a pause on whatever

11:35.320 --> 11:37.114
you got going
until I get back to you.

11:45.997 --> 11:47.749
All right.
Later, man.

11:47.833 --> 11:49.473
All right,
where's the next pick up?

11:49.501 --> 11:50.627
Bushwick.

11:50.711 --> 11:53.171
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

11:53.588 --> 11:54.881
Hello?

11:54.965 --> 11:57.217
The girl you
are seeing,

11:57.300 --> 12:00.095
I don't want you
dating her anymore.

12:00.178 --> 12:02.418
What about the suit
that I borrowed for the date?

12:02.472 --> 12:03.807
You want me to bring it back?

12:03.890 --> 12:05.934
No, I have flu.

12:06.017 --> 12:07.394
Nasty virus.

12:07.477 --> 12:09.855
So stay away from me for now.

12:09.938 --> 12:12.274
Okay. Yeah, you got it.
You got it.

12:12.357 --> 12:14.443
Hey, it's beautiful
day today, huh?

12:14.526 --> 12:16.778
Maybe you go to the zoo.

12:18.864 --> 12:21.158
- What?
- He-

12:21.241 --> 12:23.493
He just cancelled
the rest of the pick-ups.

12:23.577 --> 12:25.287
What the fuck? Why?

12:25.370 --> 12:26.580
I don't know.

12:26.663 --> 12:28.599
He just wants us to hold the
money and stay the fuck away

12:28.623 --> 12:30.417
from the garage until tomorrow.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.002
I mean, what if
it's all off, man?

12:32.085 --> 12:33.938
This was our chance to
start something on our own!

12:33.962 --> 12:35.523
- All right. Calm down.
- This has to happen.

12:35.547 --> 12:37.400
All he did was delay things
until tomorrow, right?

12:37.424 --> 12:39.634
I knew he would do this.
He doesn't trust you.

12:39.718 --> 12:40.969
Why wouldn't he trust me?

12:41.052 --> 12:43.263
He doesn't trust me,
so he can't fucking trust you!

12:43.346 --> 12:44.806
Fuck him!

12:48.602 --> 12:49.686
Hold on.

12:50.812 --> 12:52.522
How much you think
we have in the trunk?

13:33.897 --> 13:36.024
We have this money
until tomorrow.

13:36.107 --> 13:38.276
What's the harm of
putting it to good use?

13:39.402 --> 13:42.823
You wanna take money that
belongs to God knows who,

13:43.824 --> 13:46.576
that your uncle is laundering
through me, that I am risking

13:46.660 --> 13:49.579
everything on,
and use it on a drug deal.

13:49.663 --> 13:51.915
This is not a
drug deal, drug deal,

13:51.998 --> 13:53.726
and it's pure fucking
coke at half the price.

13:53.750 --> 13:54.668
That's a drug deal.

13:54.751 --> 13:55.895
And FedEx is putting
up half the money,

13:55.919 --> 13:57.712
so he's got just
as much on the line.

13:58.630 --> 14:00.090
I ain't doing it, man.

14:00.799 --> 14:02.384
Partners, my ass.
I knew-

14:02.467 --> 14:04.678
Partners listen to one another.
You ain't listening.

14:04.761 --> 14:06.638
No, I'm listening.
I get it.

14:06.721 --> 14:08.849
It's too risky for you.
So, you know what?

14:08.932 --> 14:11.059
Go back to your diamond
district, where it's safe.

14:11.142 --> 14:12.310
My uncle called me.

14:12.394 --> 14:13.937
I'm the one holding his money.

14:14.020 --> 14:16.398
Anything goes wrong,
you're off the hook.

14:18.775 --> 14:20.569
I'm not off the hook
when you're dead.

14:23.697 --> 14:25.323
It's worth the risk.

14:26.283 --> 14:28.285
I have nothing, bro.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.328
I ain't you.

14:30.412 --> 14:32.330
Come on, half the time
I can't even find you.

14:32.414 --> 14:34.058
I know you've been
making moves on your own.

14:34.082 --> 14:35.208
That ain't true, man.

14:35.292 --> 14:37.002
Why you always
disappearing and shit?

14:37.085 --> 14:38.545
I've known you for two years.

14:38.628 --> 14:40.589
Not once have I ever
not answered your call.

14:40.672 --> 14:43.508
Every other night, I got no
idea where the fuck you are.

14:43.592 --> 14:45.176
Listen, you got
your other business.

14:45.260 --> 14:46.845
I get that.
That's cool.

14:46.928 --> 14:49.723
So yeah, I wanna make
moves on my own for once.

14:49.806 --> 14:51.349
I'll call you after
I sell the shit.

14:51.433 --> 14:52.684
Just stop.

14:52.767 --> 14:54.144
You're not stopping me, Moe.

14:54.227 --> 14:56.187
Yeah, I can see that,
you stubborn fuck.

14:57.606 --> 14:59.107
Jesus.

15:01.860 --> 15:03.528
Goddamnit, man.

15:03.612 --> 15:04.612
Fuck.

15:13.455 --> 15:15.624
We do this, we're not
using FedEx's money.

15:16.791 --> 15:18.752
You won't be sorry.
You'll see.

15:20.795 --> 15:21.671
You said you have a buyer?

15:21.755 --> 15:23.632
Irv Waxman's son, Richie.

15:23.715 --> 15:24.799
All right, call him.

15:24.883 --> 15:26.803
We don't pull the trigger
unless he has the cash.

15:55.080 --> 15:55.830
Hey.

15:55.914 --> 15:57.832
Hey!
You on your way?

15:59.167 --> 16:00.502
No, I'm not gonna make it.

16:00.585 --> 16:04.631
Wha-what do you mean?
Everyone is expecting you.

16:04.714 --> 16:06.883
Yeah, I know.
It's just...

16:06.967 --> 16:08.426
Look, I'll
make it up to you.

16:08.510 --> 16:09.719
I just can't leave right now.

16:11.012 --> 16:13.848
Moe,
when is this going to end?

16:16.518 --> 16:17.686
Soon.

16:18.979 --> 16:20.730
Look, don't let this
get you down, okay?

16:20.814 --> 16:22.273
Have a nice night
with your friend,

16:22.357 --> 16:23.775
and I'll see you tomorrow.

16:24.651 --> 16:25.651
Bye.

16:32.659 --> 16:33.994
Look at this guy.

16:34.077 --> 16:35.120
He cracks me up.

16:36.204 --> 16:37.872
Hope he goes for this.

16:39.541 --> 16:42.335
Hey!
Skunkie! What's up, man?

16:44.295 --> 16:45.797
How ya doin?

16:47.590 --> 16:50.093
Hey, man.
You fucking ready?

16:52.679 --> 16:56.182
So, they said they'd call us
with a location in an hour.

16:56.683 --> 16:57.976
Same Nigerian?

16:58.059 --> 16:59.686
- Yeah, dude. Debo.
- Debo.

16:59.769 --> 17:01.229
Yeah.

17:01.896 --> 17:02.897
Yeah.

17:02.981 --> 17:04.941
Quick question, though.

17:05.025 --> 17:06.859
Are you guys good
taking it like this?

17:06.943 --> 17:08.503
I don't know how you
guys usually, you know,

17:08.528 --> 17:09.904
pack your money and shit.

17:11.281 --> 17:13.032
I'm not gonna need your money.

17:15.702 --> 17:16.994
What's that supposed to mean?

17:17.078 --> 17:18.913
How long has your
father owned this place?

17:26.003 --> 17:27.003
Twenty years.

17:27.047 --> 17:28.566
What's that gotta do
with anything, though?

17:28.590 --> 17:29.758
Well, everything.

17:30.884 --> 17:32.653
You've got more money in that
box than your father has made

17:32.677 --> 17:33.677
his entire life.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.638
You wanna risk it on
a fucking drug deal?

17:35.722 --> 17:37.307
He's right, man.

17:40.935 --> 17:42.812
Skunkie, you gonna
do this to me, man?

17:43.897 --> 17:45.940
I brought this
shit to you, dude!

17:46.024 --> 17:47.984
You'll get 10% of what we clear.

17:49.027 --> 17:50.987
That's a
sweet deal for you.

17:51.071 --> 17:54.157
You sit here all safe and cozy,
risk-free and you make what,

17:54.240 --> 17:56.284
60G?

17:56.367 --> 17:59.370
Sixty? You know you guys are
buying this half price, right?

17:59.454 --> 18:00.955
It is what it is.

18:01.039 --> 18:03.833
You think I'm holding out,
you take the deal down yourself.

18:03.917 --> 18:05.085
Skunkie, come on, man.

18:05.168 --> 18:07.229
You know I don't have the
money to do this on my own.

18:07.253 --> 18:08.254
Your call.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.303
All right, man.
Fuck.

18:15.386 --> 18:17.281
So, what am I supposed to
tell Debo when he calls?

18:17.305 --> 18:18.181
I'm not coming?

18:18.264 --> 18:20.308
Listen.
Regardless of what happens,

18:20.391 --> 18:22.519
we meet tonight
at the club at 2:00.

18:26.689 --> 18:28.024
Ah, fuck.

18:34.280 --> 18:36.282
Don't look so sad.

18:37.617 --> 18:39.160
Your father would be proud.

18:39.244 --> 18:41.037
Oh, yeah.
Fuck, yeah.

18:51.005 --> 18:52.005
Fuck.

19:08.022 --> 19:10.650
I don't like this, man.
Who sets a deal out here?

19:10.733 --> 19:12.610
You worry too much, man.

19:12.694 --> 19:14.070
FedEx and Debo are boys.

19:32.088 --> 19:33.089
You Debo?

19:34.757 --> 19:36.009
Yeah, man.

19:37.218 --> 19:38.511
I'm Debo.

19:38.595 --> 19:40.180
All right.
Come on, let's do this.

20:06.873 --> 20:08.583
You gonna dip?

20:32.649 --> 20:33.983
We're good.

21:08.685 --> 21:10.103
Yo, we good?

21:11.813 --> 21:13.648
This is a one-time deal.

21:13.731 --> 21:15.042
We need to make sure
everything is right.

21:17.819 --> 21:19.112
Hang on! It's the cops!

21:20.113 --> 21:21.239
What the fuck?

21:28.621 --> 21:29.789
Fucking cops!

21:35.628 --> 21:37.338
Come on,
let's go, let's go!

21:37.422 --> 21:38.881
Grab a kilo, man.

21:40.091 --> 21:42.635
Yo, Africa Bambaataa
get the fuck outta here!

21:42.719 --> 21:45.471
Yeah.
Be cool, man. We go. We going.

21:45.555 --> 21:46.973
What is he fucking doing?

21:50.435 --> 21:52.228
Come on, let's go!
Move it!

21:53.396 --> 21:55.023
Where the
fuck are they going?

22:08.494 --> 22:10.955
Drop your fucking
weapons and come out!

22:12.832 --> 22:15.043
Yo, you two
go around, flank them behind.

22:16.294 --> 22:19.172
Come out and drop
your fucking weapons!

22:20.048 --> 22:22.925
Be smart and don't get
yourselves in any more shit!

22:25.053 --> 22:26.763
They're gonna take
my uncle's money.

22:26.846 --> 22:28.306
We're fucking dead, man!

22:28.389 --> 22:29.265
No, wait, wait, wait.

22:29.349 --> 22:31.309
The fuck are we gonna do?

22:32.060 --> 22:34.103
This is a bust,
where's your backup?

22:34.187 --> 22:36.439
How come we don't
hear no sirens?

22:40.693 --> 22:42.987
All right. All right.
Let's talk about this.

22:43.571 --> 22:45.531
Sure, yeah.

22:45.615 --> 22:47.784
Fucking dirty fucks.

22:47.867 --> 22:49.452
Come on, bro, you
got nowhere to go.

22:49.535 --> 22:52.163
Drop your weapons and
let's talk this out.

22:52.246 --> 22:53.289
Fuck you!

22:53.373 --> 22:55.017
You think we're gonna
trust dirty fucking pigs!

22:55.041 --> 22:57.543
You got not a chance in hell
of leaving alive unless you

22:57.627 --> 22:59.504
motherfuckers come out now!

23:06.677 --> 23:07.970
Shit!

23:08.054 --> 23:09.054
Move, move, move!

23:12.475 --> 23:14.602
Dirty
motherfuckers got a shooter!

23:14.685 --> 23:16.229
Leon, you good?

23:20.400 --> 23:21.734
Man, it's Suzuki!

23:21.818 --> 23:22.902
He's laying cover.

23:23.569 --> 23:24.779
Let's go!

23:32.662 --> 23:33.662
Fuck!

23:35.581 --> 23:37.781
What the fuck is
this fucking guy's problem!

23:50.763 --> 23:51.763
Fuck!

23:58.646 --> 24:00.356
They're leaving!
Let's go!

24:00.773 --> 24:02.275
Motherfuckers!

24:03.234 --> 24:03.734
Fuck!

24:34.932 --> 24:35.932
Fuck.

24:36.184 --> 24:37.226
Shit.

24:38.895 --> 24:40.855
Yo, FedEx, it was a setup!

24:40.938 --> 24:43.483
Don't say shit!
2:00 a.m.!

24:44.150 --> 24:45.651
Don't you fucking say it!

25:12.053 --> 25:13.262
Go! Go! Go!

25:13.346 --> 25:14.931
Fuck! Fuck!

25:21.896 --> 25:22.980
Drive!

25:28.236 --> 25:29.612
Fuck!

25:33.866 --> 25:36.285
Yo, we lost the cops!
We lost the cops!

25:42.041 --> 25:43.334
What? Whoa!

26:18.744 --> 26:20.538
What the fuck.

26:26.794 --> 26:27.878
Fuck.

26:45.396 --> 26:46.689
Moe!

27:04.498 --> 27:05.541
Moe!

27:09.337 --> 27:11.130
Go! We gotta go!

27:11.213 --> 27:13.007
Go, go, go, go, go!

27:13.090 --> 27:15.092
Come on, we gotta go. Come on.

27:25.019 --> 27:26.562
Fuck.
Come on.

27:26.646 --> 27:28.856
No, no, we gotta go.
We gotta go.

27:29.565 --> 27:31.067
Suzuki's here.
Come on.

27:31.150 --> 27:33.569
I can't fucking see.
I can't fucking see.

27:33.653 --> 27:34.653
That's alright.

27:35.863 --> 27:37.156
Come on. Come on.

27:39.533 --> 27:40.785
Go, go!

27:48.167 --> 27:49.293
Just breathe.

27:49.377 --> 27:51.104
We need to get this
motherfucker to a hospital!

27:51.128 --> 27:53.005
Take the tunnel to Jersey, man!

28:11.607 --> 28:13.776
We gotta talk.
We got a big fucking problem.

28:15.945 --> 28:16.987
We lost a load.

28:17.071 --> 28:18.071
What?

28:20.533 --> 28:21.659
What about the money?

28:24.912 --> 28:26.247
We lost all of it.

28:29.041 --> 28:30.334
Listen to me.

28:30.418 --> 28:32.837
You don't get every ounce of
that product back to evidence,

28:32.920 --> 28:34.422
we're finished.

28:35.047 --> 28:36.382
How much time
can you buy us?

28:39.635 --> 28:41.137
Monday.

28:41.220 --> 28:42.930
At the latest!

28:43.013 --> 28:44.348
Okay, I got it.

28:44.432 --> 28:46.016
That's a nice tie.

28:46.684 --> 28:47.768
Asshole.

28:48.936 --> 28:51.355
We were in the same car.

28:54.108 --> 28:55.234
How is he?

28:55.317 --> 28:56.694
He's okay.

28:57.611 --> 28:59.613
He sustained a bad concussion,
but it looks okay.

28:59.697 --> 29:01.907
Doctor wants to check
him when he wakes.

29:01.991 --> 29:04.219
And he needs to fill out a
report before he's discharged.

29:04.243 --> 29:05.119
What kind of report?

29:05.202 --> 29:06.871
He had some unusual
items on him.

29:06.954 --> 29:09.582
- What do you mean?
- Like what?

29:09.665 --> 29:10.791
Like a gun.

29:13.085 --> 29:14.085
Gun?

29:14.128 --> 29:15.796
Police are on their
way to take a report.

29:16.589 --> 29:18.883
Actually, it'd be good if
you stayed till they arrived.

29:20.259 --> 29:21.469
Thank you.

29:23.095 --> 29:23.929
Moe.

29:24.013 --> 29:25.514
Moe, can you hear me?

29:25.598 --> 29:27.391
Moe! Moe! Moe!

29:27.475 --> 29:28.309
Can you hear me?

29:28.392 --> 29:29.310
Hey, wake up.

29:29.393 --> 29:30.436
Come on, come on.

29:30.519 --> 29:32.146
We can't stay here.

29:32.229 --> 29:33.689
Where are your clothes?

29:34.523 --> 29:35.900
Come on.

29:39.779 --> 29:41.655
Where am I?
What's going on?

29:41.739 --> 29:44.116
Moe! Come on! Up we go.

29:44.200 --> 29:45.534
Up we go. Let's go.

29:46.744 --> 29:47.787
Don't fall over.

29:47.870 --> 29:49.079
Gotta get your IV.

29:49.163 --> 29:50.414
Come on! Come on, man.

30:11.352 --> 30:13.270
Oh, God, it hurts.

30:14.647 --> 30:16.398
Where are we-

30:16.482 --> 30:18.609
Where are we going?

30:22.071 --> 30:24.490
We'll get you some help.
Just hang on.

30:27.201 --> 30:28.494
Oh shit!

30:38.671 --> 30:40.756
You okay? All right, relax.
Just relax.

30:40.840 --> 30:42.675
I had to take you
out of that hospital!

30:49.181 --> 30:50.349
Have some water.

30:50.850 --> 30:52.393
Moe. Whoa, whoa, whoa!

31:07.658 --> 31:09.658
So, what's
the last thing you remember?

31:16.250 --> 31:17.543
I don't know.

31:19.503 --> 31:20.671
What's your name?

31:23.966 --> 31:25.926
Moe, I think.

31:26.010 --> 31:27.678
That's what he's
been calling me.

31:30.931 --> 31:32.725
That's okay.
That's all right.

31:33.350 --> 31:34.643
You're my doctor?

31:35.728 --> 31:37.229
Not unless you're pregnant.

31:37.730 --> 31:38.730
We're friends.

31:38.772 --> 31:39.812
What do you think?

31:40.608 --> 31:42.568
He needs to see a
neurologist, man.

31:43.736 --> 31:47.072
So there's no danger in keeping
him out of the hospital?

31:47.156 --> 31:48.449
He should be fine.

31:48.532 --> 31:50.594
I mean, I'm not an expert, but I
would think that everything but

31:50.618 --> 31:53.245
the events just right before
the accident should come back.

31:54.246 --> 31:56.874
And for now, just re-introduce
him to old familiar things,

31:56.957 --> 31:59.418
apartment, family, friends.

32:00.502 --> 32:02.463
What if I can't
do that right now?

32:03.422 --> 32:05.799
Well, there's gotta be
something you can show him.

32:17.102 --> 32:19.647
My boy Nick hooked
us up with this room.

32:35.371 --> 32:36.872
All right, all right.

32:38.540 --> 32:40.459
This bring anything back?

32:41.627 --> 32:43.420
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

32:44.588 --> 32:46.548
How about this?

32:47.341 --> 32:49.009
This jog your memory?

32:50.970 --> 32:54.223
We took this coke from
dirty fucking cops, Moe,

32:54.306 --> 32:56.016
who were trying to kill us.

32:56.100 --> 32:58.727
And before we unload it and
leave, my uncle might decide

32:58.811 --> 33:01.772
it's easier to kill us himself
than clean up the fucking mess.

33:03.649 --> 33:05.317
I'm a fucking drug dealer?

33:05.401 --> 33:07.611
No, you're jeweler
and a money launderer.

33:07.695 --> 33:09.321
Well, how does
jeweler lead to this?

33:09.405 --> 33:11.615
We're friends, and
I needed your help.

33:15.494 --> 33:19.581
We unload this, we walk away
with three million, cash.

33:22.084 --> 33:24.378
We gotta go, man.
We told FedEx 2:00 a.m.

33:24.461 --> 33:25.897
Come on, come on, come on.
We gotta go.

33:25.921 --> 33:28.799
No, no, no.
I wanna see where I live first.

33:28.882 --> 33:30.926
You don't think I'd take
you there if it was safe?

33:31.010 --> 33:32.845
These cops could be
there waiting for us.

33:32.928 --> 33:35.222
Well, I gotta see something
other than money and drugs!

33:35.305 --> 33:37.182
You will.
We're meeting FedEx

33:37.266 --> 33:39.685
somewhere you've been a
thousand times before.

33:40.352 --> 33:41.770
You know people there.

33:43.981 --> 33:45.441
You just gotta trust me.

33:52.823 --> 33:54.908
Who the fuck are you?

33:54.992 --> 33:55.784
Your friend!

33:55.868 --> 33:57.411
You fucking lie!

33:57.494 --> 33:59.038
Why would I make this shit up?

33:59.705 --> 34:01.957
Come on, man, put the gun down.

34:02.041 --> 34:03.751
I'm your friend.

34:05.002 --> 34:06.002
Fuck!

34:07.588 --> 34:08.505
Fuck!

34:08.589 --> 34:10.299
What the fuck, man!

34:10.382 --> 34:11.967
You don't think people
just heard that

34:12.051 --> 34:13.844
and called the fucking cops!

34:16.096 --> 34:17.097
Fuck!

34:49.129 --> 34:51.172
How?
I don't know how.

34:51.255 --> 34:54.635
I slid open the terrace
door and the glass exploded.

34:54.717 --> 34:57.596
No, Jimmy, Jimmy,
please... fine.

34:57.679 --> 35:00.099
Send up a key for a new room.

35:00.182 --> 35:01.725
I'm taking care of you, right?

35:16.532 --> 35:18.117
You're like my brother, man.

35:20.494 --> 35:22.663
If you don't feel
that in your gut,

35:22.746 --> 35:26.208
then I can't talk you into it.

35:30.796 --> 35:33.841
I feel like
I'm running, hiding.

35:36.218 --> 35:41.056
We are running from this city,
my uncle, dirty fucking cops.

35:42.683 --> 35:44.560
You're not going crazy.

35:45.602 --> 35:47.479
That feeling is real.

36:03.245 --> 36:04.663
How you doing?

36:04.746 --> 36:06.498
Hello.
How are you?

36:06.582 --> 36:07.916
This is your place?

36:08.000 --> 36:09.209
Yes. How can I help you?

36:12.838 --> 36:15.238
A man we're trying to identify
may have been in here earlier,

36:15.299 --> 36:18.135
so me and my partner here wanna
see your surveillance footage.

36:18.218 --> 36:19.511
Yeah, sure.
My son can help you.

36:19.595 --> 36:21.013
He's in the cooler, stocking.

36:21.430 --> 36:22.806
Ranjit!

36:25.184 --> 36:26.643
Make it a, a half pint.

36:26.727 --> 36:27.603
Jack?

36:27.686 --> 36:30.105
No, no. The 12-year's good.

36:30.189 --> 36:32.357
- Long day, huh?
- Yeah.

36:32.441 --> 36:34.151
Long fucking day.

36:34.234 --> 36:35.986
Yeah, tell me about it.

36:37.029 --> 36:39.156
So your son, he's very lucky.

36:39.948 --> 36:42.367
He avoided a murder
earlier today.

36:42.451 --> 36:44.953
- Who, my son?
- Yeah.

36:45.037 --> 36:46.872
- Murdered?
- Yeah.

36:46.955 --> 36:48.498
He was supposed to
be at a drug deal.

36:48.582 --> 36:51.710
Had he shown up, he'd
been robbed and killed.

36:54.129 --> 36:55.422
That man you're looking for?

36:55.505 --> 36:57.132
Yeah, yeah, I'm afraid so.

36:57.216 --> 37:00.385
That's why we need your help, so
we can apprehend the bad people,

37:00.469 --> 37:02.221
make sure your son stays safe.

37:02.304 --> 37:05.641
Ranjit, these police need
the video from today.

37:06.558 --> 37:07.601
What's up, man?

37:10.437 --> 37:11.813
You must be FedEx.

37:12.940 --> 37:14.316
My name is Ranjit.

37:14.399 --> 37:17.486
Hm-mm. You really wanna
go down that road?

37:19.363 --> 37:22.324
You wouldn't happen to have one
of those internet surveillance

37:22.407 --> 37:23.825
systems, would you?

37:23.909 --> 37:25.077
Help us speed things up.

37:25.160 --> 37:27.746
No, no. We-
It is too expensive.

37:27.829 --> 37:29.331
We only have the videotape.

37:30.040 --> 37:31.040
Really?

37:31.625 --> 37:32.417
That's good.

37:36.546 --> 37:38.924
Sit the fuck down!
You fucked up.

37:39.007 --> 37:40.884
No, please, please,
please, please!

37:40.968 --> 37:41.968
Hey, come on, man!

37:42.010 --> 37:43.446
You should've showed
up to the fucking deal,

37:43.470 --> 37:44.346
like you were supposed to!

37:44.429 --> 37:45.782
No! I'll tell
you where they are, man!

37:45.806 --> 37:46.890
You motherfucker.

37:46.974 --> 37:48.076
Hey, please, man! Please!
I know where they'll be!

37:48.100 --> 37:49.142
I know where they'll be!

37:54.231 --> 37:55.983
Liverpool,
what's up, man?

38:45.657 --> 38:47.159
Suzuki.

38:47.492 --> 38:48.744
Yo, what up?

38:50.954 --> 38:51.955
Moe!

38:52.039 --> 38:53.540
How you feeling, man?

38:55.042 --> 38:56.293
Is this the guy from the deal?

38:56.376 --> 38:58.337
Yeah, yeah.
You see, it's all coming back.

38:58.920 --> 39:00.964
His memory got a
little screwed up.

39:01.548 --> 39:03.300
Little? How little?

39:03.383 --> 39:05.052
He can't remember a thing.

39:05.135 --> 39:07.012
Damn. That's fucked up.

39:08.347 --> 39:10.974
We emptied your pockets
before leaving you at the ER.

39:11.058 --> 39:13.310
You know this motherfucker had
a revolver strapped on

39:13.393 --> 39:14.495
- his ankle?
- Did they find it?

39:14.519 --> 39:17.147
Yeah. We barely got out
before the cops got there.

39:27.574 --> 39:29.451
Yo, you think FedEx
is gonna show?

39:29.534 --> 39:31.953
He better. He's got a
lot of explaining to do.

39:32.913 --> 39:34.164
Fucking amateur!

39:34.247 --> 39:38.627
- We got this motherfuckin...
- What the fuck?

39:38.710 --> 39:40.837
Could you imagine
had we showed up alone?

39:40.921 --> 39:42.839
Yo, what was that-

39:42.923 --> 39:44.966
that Nigerian from the
deal, what was his name?

39:45.050 --> 39:46.885
Debo. And what good
is that gonna do us?

39:46.968 --> 39:48.845
You're gonna drive
yourself crazy.

39:50.722 --> 39:52.492
We're pushing unloading the
product until after I meet

39:52.516 --> 39:53.600
with my uncle.

39:53.683 --> 39:55.018
All right, I got you.

39:56.645 --> 39:58.313
My head is killing me.

39:58.397 --> 39:59.648
Here.

40:01.525 --> 40:02.859
This'll help.

40:06.947 --> 40:08.240
It'll help.

40:25.590 --> 40:26.670
How's that?

41:16.016 --> 41:17.100
Hey.

41:17.767 --> 41:18.810
Hey.

41:19.144 --> 41:21.521
So, you're not gonna
share with me tonight?

41:28.820 --> 41:29.988
Do you know me?

41:33.158 --> 41:34.284
Yeah.

42:45.397 --> 42:47.983
Yo, you know that guy?

42:48.066 --> 42:49.317
Yo, we know everybody.

44:02.015 --> 44:03.224
You fucker!

44:12.734 --> 44:13.735
I'm a cop!

44:13.818 --> 44:15.111
How the fuck do you know me?

44:15.195 --> 44:16.529
I don't. I swear.

44:16.613 --> 44:17.923
Why the fuck are
you following me?

44:17.947 --> 44:19.240
Just following orders.

44:20.742 --> 44:21.785
I swear.

44:33.338 --> 44:34.798
I'm sorry.

44:34.881 --> 44:36.257
I blew my cover.

44:36.841 --> 44:38.885
It's okay, man.

44:38.968 --> 44:40.637
We know who they are.

44:40.720 --> 44:42.681
It's only a matter of time.

44:42.764 --> 44:44.349
We'll find them.

44:47.268 --> 44:49.080
Everything under
control over here, fellas?

44:49.104 --> 44:51.940
Yeah, we're good. We're good.
Keep driving.

44:55.777 --> 44:57.362
Why are we being
so quiet on this?

44:58.363 --> 45:00.699
We think they may be
involved with some dirty blues.

45:00.782 --> 45:02.492
What, in our department?

45:02.575 --> 45:04.911
Could be.
So this stays with us, okay?

45:04.994 --> 45:06.037
Yeah.

45:07.247 --> 45:07.914
Good.

45:07.997 --> 45:09.457
Yo, we got something.

45:10.792 --> 45:11.918
What up?

45:12.001 --> 45:13.771
Yeah, bartender said the
Asian they were hanging with,

45:13.795 --> 45:15.797
he knows him.
Kenjo Suzuki.

45:15.880 --> 45:16.880
Checked his name.

45:16.923 --> 45:18.508
Drives and X3 with
a Chinatown address.

45:20.552 --> 45:22.154
That's him right there.
That's out shooter.

45:22.178 --> 45:24.973
Fucking chinks.
So, you know this motherfucker?

45:25.765 --> 45:28.435
So that's Petey,
this is Alonso, Cheech.

45:28.518 --> 45:29.811
And that's Nico.

45:29.894 --> 45:32.063
He's a liar and he'll
fuck anything that moves.

45:32.147 --> 45:34.441
So you wanna watch
yourself around him.

45:34.524 --> 45:36.526
Hey, Moe,
you got that for me?

45:36.609 --> 45:38.319
Again with this
19-year-old, huh?

45:38.403 --> 45:39.404
She's 20.

45:39.487 --> 45:41.132
You promised you'd get
him a ring for this girl.

45:41.156 --> 45:42.216
Tell him you're working on it.

45:42.240 --> 45:45.493
- She's 20, guys. Twenty.
- I'm working on it.

45:45.577 --> 45:46.577
How you doing?

45:46.619 --> 45:49.122
I'll be right back.
Don't leave.

45:49.205 --> 45:50.582
Oh man!
This fucking guy.

45:55.253 --> 45:57.464
Listen. Look,
I'm gonna be right back, okay?

45:57.547 --> 45:59.048
You guys fill him in on things.

45:59.132 --> 46:00.508
Oh, yeah,
we'll fill him in.

46:06.973 --> 46:08.016
You cool, man?

46:08.099 --> 46:09.559
Yeah, I'm cool.

46:09.642 --> 46:11.352
You're fucking good?

46:11.811 --> 46:13.104
What happened?

46:17.400 --> 46:19.569
Hey, Genie, is my uncle busy?

46:26.701 --> 46:28.912
Some poor guy is
in there with his daughter.

46:28.995 --> 46:31.581
Says she was molested
by one of the drivers.

46:31.664 --> 46:33.041
At a charity car wash.

46:33.958 --> 46:36.270
You remember that girl running
around topless with her boobs

46:36.294 --> 46:38.755
jumping up and down
underneath the soap suds?

46:38.838 --> 46:40.131
Yeah.

46:40.215 --> 46:41.925
You should see her now.

46:47.639 --> 46:48.932
Who did you tell?

46:50.642 --> 46:51.768
Janet.

46:52.393 --> 46:53.978
She told my sister.

46:55.897 --> 46:59.484
But I told my dad it
was one of the drivers.

47:00.777 --> 47:02.612
So he doesn't know about you.

47:07.909 --> 47:09.202
Are you mad at me?

47:10.411 --> 47:11.913
Hmm!

47:41.693 --> 47:42.777
Yeah.

47:42.861 --> 47:44.320
Bobby's here.

47:44.821 --> 47:46.364
Have him wait.

47:51.411 --> 47:53.955
So you don't remember?
Not a thing?

47:58.793 --> 48:02.005
You don't remember
anything about me?

48:06.467 --> 48:08.094
What, are you fucking stupid?

48:09.345 --> 48:10.680
I'm your father!

48:11.139 --> 48:12.515
Stupid?

48:13.224 --> 48:15.560
I'm fucking with you.
All right, all right, chill.

48:16.769 --> 48:19.188
I'm fucking with you, bro.

48:19.272 --> 48:20.732
I'm fucking with you.

48:21.774 --> 48:23.818
You and me-

48:26.112 --> 48:27.715
we were lovers, dude.
You don't remember that?

48:27.739 --> 48:28.990
Hey!

48:29.574 --> 48:31.135
What the fuck is
wrong with you, man?

48:31.159 --> 48:33.578
You bastards!
All right! All right!

48:35.288 --> 48:36.557
What the fuck are
you doing, man?

48:36.581 --> 48:37.790
Whoa!!

48:40.501 --> 48:42.462
Bobby, let's talk inside.

48:42.545 --> 48:44.339
Come on. Come on!

48:44.422 --> 48:45.506
All right!

48:47.258 --> 48:50.011
So you take my money
and set up side deal where

48:50.094 --> 48:52.138
- you will make...
- A million.

48:53.264 --> 48:56.601
Even after I call and
tell you everything is off!

48:58.978 --> 49:00.229
Dumb shit!

49:00.313 --> 49:03.483
How are you gonna do pick-ups
with the cops after you!

49:03.566 --> 49:06.486
How's your friend gonna wash it
when he can't remember how to

49:06.569 --> 49:08.529
wipe his own ass!

49:09.614 --> 49:10.782
Huh?

49:21.000 --> 49:22.669
Hello.

49:22.752 --> 49:24.754
- Can you talk?
- Yeah.

49:24.837 --> 49:27.215
I'm alone. Go ahead.

49:28.174 --> 49:29.759
There's nothing on your nephew.

49:29.842 --> 49:32.345
No warrants, no APBs, nothing.

49:33.721 --> 49:35.556
If cops are after him,
they don't want

49:35.640 --> 49:36.975
anyone knowing about it.

49:37.725 --> 49:39.936
But you may have
a bigger problem.

49:40.937 --> 49:42.522
Moe Diamond?

49:42.605 --> 49:44.649
No. I checked again.

49:45.984 --> 49:47.485
Diamond's clean.

49:50.321 --> 49:51.739
So, what's the problem?

49:51.823 --> 49:55.076
It's you. Someone submitted
an FBI background check.

49:55.159 --> 49:56.077
Who?

49:56.160 --> 49:57.996
Congressman's Freed's office.

49:59.122 --> 50:00.581
That's not problem.

50:00.665 --> 50:02.792
The prick's just doing his job.

50:02.875 --> 50:04.335
You working with Freed?

50:04.419 --> 50:05.670
Hey!

50:06.337 --> 50:09.257
I call you back in ten.
Answer.

50:09.340 --> 50:10.508
All right.

50:16.305 --> 50:19.058
I have congressmen
checking up on me.

50:19.559 --> 50:22.395
I have the biggest
bank in New York

50:22.478 --> 50:25.023
financing my real estate deal.

50:25.648 --> 50:29.861
And you're out there risking
it all on a two-bit drug deal!

50:30.486 --> 50:32.196
This is my mess.

50:32.280 --> 50:34.198
And I'll clean it up.

50:34.282 --> 50:35.950
None of it comes back to you.

50:36.367 --> 50:39.954
You are not cleaning up a thing.

50:40.038 --> 50:44.083
You bring back my money and
you leave New York forever!

50:46.919 --> 50:49.130
I let you keep the product.

50:49.213 --> 50:52.967
But that means I'm
financing your lives.

50:54.010 --> 50:56.137
And I get a cut for life.

51:00.058 --> 51:01.684
That's fair.

51:14.697 --> 51:19.535
You are my sister's
son so I let this go.

51:28.461 --> 51:31.589
But if you don't leave
like you're supposed to...

51:31.672 --> 51:33.508
We're leaving.
Today.

51:41.182 --> 51:44.894
So, Unc, you know, like
with the Town Car you know,

51:44.977 --> 51:46.646
I had to turn that in. So...

51:48.106 --> 51:51.192
You think I could
like borrow a car?

51:51.275 --> 51:54.112
No, you can't borrow a car.

51:54.529 --> 51:55.988
You can have one.

51:56.072 --> 51:57.490
Thank you.

51:59.492 --> 52:02.495
Oohh! I like this one.

52:04.038 --> 52:05.373
Yeah, this one's nice.

52:05.456 --> 52:06.707
Aghh!

52:06.791 --> 52:10.378
I think you lost your taste
along with your memory.

52:10.461 --> 52:12.171
What, you don't like it?

52:14.006 --> 52:15.049
Mweh...

52:20.388 --> 52:23.099
You know, all right, man,
I'll let you pick it.

52:23.182 --> 52:25.017
But, you know,
it's hot in Miami.

52:25.101 --> 52:26.686
You better hope it has AC.

52:27.812 --> 52:29.730
I wanna go to my
apartment first.

52:29.814 --> 52:32.692
That's not a good idea.
We're not going there, Moe.

52:32.775 --> 52:33.901
I'll go alone.

52:33.985 --> 52:35.736
Get in the fucking car.

52:35.820 --> 52:37.363
You're not going
alone, all right?

52:37.446 --> 52:39.115
Jesus Christ.

52:40.783 --> 52:43.077
This is not a good idea.

52:54.547 --> 52:56.549
All right. All right.
Get off.

52:56.632 --> 52:58.551
Okay. Okay. Exit 5.

53:15.651 --> 53:17.195
Hey, park up here.

53:17.278 --> 53:18.905
We'll walk around the block.

53:50.686 --> 53:52.939
It's the red building.
Number 37.

53:56.234 --> 53:59.237
All right, you walk in first.
I'll make sure no one follows.

54:03.741 --> 54:04.784
What's the matter?

54:07.662 --> 54:09.538
I was hoping I'd recognize it.

54:19.924 --> 54:21.509
Sh-sh-sh-sht.

54:25.763 --> 54:27.265
Did you hear that?

54:37.692 --> 54:38.692
Shh-st.

54:59.338 --> 55:00.965
Don't you-
Oh, fuck!

55:01.048 --> 55:02.091
Oh, my God!

55:02.174 --> 55:03.843
Lola, what the fuck!

55:03.926 --> 55:05.261
Moe.

55:05.344 --> 55:08.014
You're pregnant?
Moe, what the fuck is this?

55:10.433 --> 55:11.642
What happened to you?

55:11.726 --> 55:13.936
I can't believe you would
hide this shit from me.

55:14.020 --> 55:16.188
What did you
fucking get him into?

55:16.272 --> 55:17.898
He doesn't know you, Lola.

55:17.982 --> 55:19.734
He doesn't know anything.

55:19.817 --> 55:21.819
He got his head all busted up.

55:24.030 --> 55:26.574
No, don't tell me he's serious.
You don't know who I am?

55:26.657 --> 55:27.742
Is that Moe's?

55:27.825 --> 55:29.636
No, I'm just in his
apartment half-naked for fun.

55:29.660 --> 55:30.953
Get the fuck out!

55:31.037 --> 55:32.037
What?

55:32.580 --> 55:34.707
Oh, I hate when you do that.

55:35.833 --> 55:38.586
Hey, man, why wouldn't
you tell me about this?

55:38.669 --> 55:41.088
Because he hates
the way you live.

55:41.172 --> 55:42.965
We're leaving New York, Bobby.

55:44.800 --> 55:45.968
Is she for real?

55:46.052 --> 55:48.054
Will you two shut the fuck up!

55:55.186 --> 55:57.271
Yo, you gotta leave, man.

56:03.903 --> 56:05.363
This is so fucked!

56:05.446 --> 56:08.616
Hey listen, you wanna bring her,
cool, but we can't stay here!

56:11.494 --> 56:13.496
I'm going to get Suzuki.

56:15.373 --> 56:17.166
Be ready when I'm back.

56:21.504 --> 56:23.339
Baby, he's gone.

56:24.507 --> 56:25.800
Are you in trouble?

56:25.883 --> 56:27.718
What's happening?
What's going on?

56:30.262 --> 56:31.514
What?

56:33.933 --> 56:35.226
I can't remember.

56:40.022 --> 56:41.107
What?

56:48.739 --> 56:49.782
What the fuck?

56:51.826 --> 56:53.095
Are you doing
this to protect me?

56:53.119 --> 56:55.329
Can you please tell me?
Can you just...

56:57.581 --> 56:59.708
Why wouldn't I
tell Skunk about you?

57:02.878 --> 57:04.964
I knew Skunk before I met you.

57:06.132 --> 57:07.925
And when we started
seeing each other,

57:08.008 --> 57:09.677
you didn't want him to know.

57:09.760 --> 57:11.303
Why?

57:13.264 --> 57:16.475
Because you thought they
would hurt me to get to you.

57:17.226 --> 57:19.103
No, he saved my life.
Why would he do that?

57:19.186 --> 57:21.522
No, not Skunk.
His uncle.

57:21.605 --> 57:22.356
Perico?

57:22.440 --> 57:23.941
Yes.

57:24.024 --> 57:26.277
Yes, and you wouldn't
tell me much and-

57:27.528 --> 57:29.822
I tried to read
between the lines,

57:29.905 --> 57:31.991
but you would just
blow up and say things.

57:32.074 --> 57:33.325
Like what?

57:37.455 --> 57:40.291
Like "I know he killed Jimmy."

57:41.500 --> 57:42.918
Like-

57:44.044 --> 57:47.256
like, "He's gonna kill Skunk."
That he'd be next.

57:49.258 --> 57:54.305
And I didn't understand it,
why you hated him so much

57:54.388 --> 57:57.266
yet you did everything you
could to get closer to him.

58:06.066 --> 58:07.610
I feel nothing.

58:11.906 --> 58:13.741
I don't fucking feel it!

58:24.043 --> 58:26.212
I thought coming
here would help.

58:28.631 --> 58:30.424
I don't feel anything!

58:33.344 --> 58:34.386
No.

58:34.970 --> 58:36.847
No, don't say that.

58:36.931 --> 58:39.058
You're so wrong.
This is everything.

58:42.728 --> 58:44.271
You have everything
you need in here.

58:44.355 --> 58:45.481
You knew that.

58:46.190 --> 58:47.483
No.

58:51.028 --> 58:52.279
What are you doing?

58:57.117 --> 58:58.911
I want you to feel this.

59:03.040 --> 59:04.542
Do you remember?

59:06.877 --> 59:08.254
It's my baby.

59:47.293 --> 59:49.545
Yo, man, let's meet
at Moe's in an hour.

59:49.628 --> 59:51.171
We'll head off from there.

01:00:03.142 --> 01:00:05.436
Hey, Moe!
Let's hit the road!

01:00:08.022 --> 01:00:09.648
Hey, I'm gonna
tell him to come up.

01:00:09.732 --> 01:00:11.233
We gotta figure this out.

01:00:13.944 --> 01:00:15.070
Fuck!

01:00:15.988 --> 01:00:17.823
Freeze,
you motherfucker!

01:00:18.574 --> 01:00:20.117
I don't have a gun!

01:00:20.576 --> 01:00:21.493
Fuck!

01:00:21.577 --> 01:00:22.817
The other one's inside!

01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:24.038
Moe, what's going on?

01:00:24.121 --> 01:00:25.289
We gotta go.

01:00:34.048 --> 01:00:35.549
Oh, fuck!

01:00:51.815 --> 01:00:53.734
You got the
wrong motherfucker today!

01:00:53.817 --> 01:00:55.027
Moe! Run!

01:00:55.110 --> 01:00:57.154
Fucking resisting to you,
you motherfucker!

01:00:57.237 --> 01:00:59.073
Fuck you!
Fuck you! Run! Run!

01:00:59.156 --> 01:01:01.116
Get in the fucking car, I said!

01:01:02.117 --> 01:01:03.327
Fuck!

01:01:04.662 --> 01:01:05.913
Listen to me.

01:01:05.996 --> 01:01:07.998
Stop fucking with me,
all right? Or I'll leave your

01:01:08.082 --> 01:01:10.834
motherfucking brains in
the back of this fucking car.

01:01:11.835 --> 01:01:12.835
All right?

01:01:13.253 --> 01:01:14.713
Fuck!

01:01:22.971 --> 01:01:23.722
Fuck!

01:02:15.274 --> 01:02:16.817
Yo!
Out the kitchen!

01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:18.777
Out the fucking kitchen!
Police!

01:02:20.779 --> 01:02:22.322
You were never at the
restaurant!

01:02:37.296 --> 01:02:38.338
Out the fucking kitchen!

01:02:38.422 --> 01:02:40.007
Get outta here!
Police!

01:02:43.844 --> 01:02:45.721
I know you
motherfuckers are in here!

01:02:45.804 --> 01:02:47.139
Come the fuck out now!

01:02:59.109 --> 01:03:00.527
Come out now!

01:03:01.111 --> 01:03:03.113
You don't want your
girl to get fucking shot!

01:03:04.948 --> 01:03:06.533
We already got your boy!

01:03:17.044 --> 01:03:18.128
Hey! Hands up!

01:03:19.046 --> 01:03:20.246
Let me see your fucking hands!

01:03:29.807 --> 01:03:31.141
Moe.

01:03:42.069 --> 01:03:43.445
We need a hospital!

01:03:52.496 --> 01:03:54.790
Someone help us!
We need a doctor!

01:03:55.958 --> 01:03:56.958
What do we got?

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.085
She's been shot.

01:03:58.168 --> 01:04:00.087
Maurice, where are you?

01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:01.672
I'm here.
I'm right here.

01:04:01.755 --> 01:04:03.195
I'm right here, baby.
I'm right here.

01:04:03.841 --> 01:04:04.842
I'm here.

01:04:05.884 --> 01:04:07.052
You'll be okay, baby.

01:04:09.721 --> 01:04:10.722
Okay.

01:04:42.045 --> 01:04:43.171
Martinez!

01:05:23.086 --> 01:05:24.880
Sir, you can't be in here.

01:05:42.981 --> 01:05:45.525
You think you're a real big
shot messing with weight?

01:05:47.945 --> 01:05:49.613
You know, you little fuck boy,

01:05:49.696 --> 01:05:52.115
there's a girl named
Stacey from New Rochelle.

01:05:52.866 --> 01:05:54.660
She's got the most
beautiful feet.

01:05:54.743 --> 01:05:57.143
And I've been trying to tap that
ass since community college.

01:05:57.955 --> 01:05:59.539
I think I was
gonna hit it tonight.

01:06:00.457 --> 01:06:04.336
But I had to cancel, 'cause you
got us out here running around

01:06:04.419 --> 01:06:06.546
playing basketball like
some fucking monkeys.

01:06:09.967 --> 01:06:11.927
Now, tell me where
to find my product

01:06:12.010 --> 01:06:13.095
and where your friend is!

01:06:14.554 --> 01:06:16.598
Quit playing
fucking games with me!

01:06:17.849 --> 01:06:19.226
Fucking guy.

01:07:03.729 --> 01:07:04.563
Moe, chill out, man.

01:07:04.646 --> 01:07:05.397
Hey, cool off, man.

01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:07.190
Stay the fuck away, all right?

01:07:07.274 --> 01:07:08.525
You wanna fucking die!

01:07:15.282 --> 01:07:16.825
Where the fuck you going, man?

01:07:17.868 --> 01:07:19.220
This ain't between me
and you, all right?

01:07:19.244 --> 01:07:20.304
I just wanna talk to Perico.

01:07:20.328 --> 01:07:21.955
Talk to me, motherfucker.
I'm right here.

01:07:22.039 --> 01:07:23.039
Fuck you!

01:07:24.583 --> 01:07:26.418
Put the fucking gun down.

01:07:33.884 --> 01:07:35.427
You motherfucker!

01:07:38.722 --> 01:07:40.891
I made this really simple.

01:07:40.974 --> 01:07:44.311
Bring back my money
and you two leave town.

01:07:44.394 --> 01:07:48.523
Now, where is that stupid
fucking nephew of mine, huh?

01:07:49.733 --> 01:07:51.735
Cops from the deal,
they took him.

01:07:51.818 --> 01:07:53.320
He couldn't get away.

01:07:53.403 --> 01:07:55.030
Dumb bastard. Idiot.

01:08:00.410 --> 01:08:01.828
Where is the product?

01:08:01.912 --> 01:08:03.413
I have it.

01:08:03.497 --> 01:08:04.581
You have it?

01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:06.208
Good.

01:08:06.291 --> 01:08:09.169
I understand you are Bobby's
friend but I'm afraid this no

01:08:09.252 --> 01:08:12.005
longer concerns you, okay?

01:08:13.090 --> 01:08:15.383
They took the only
two people I know.

01:08:15.467 --> 01:08:17.969
This is all that
fucking concerns me.

01:08:18.053 --> 01:08:19.429
Hey, hey, look.

01:08:20.221 --> 01:08:25.018
They find out he's my nephew,
they will come looking for deal.

01:08:25.102 --> 01:08:26.728
We gave them back their product

01:08:26.812 --> 01:08:29.481
and this thing works itself out!

01:08:30.857 --> 01:08:32.109
Understand?

01:08:35.194 --> 01:08:37.279
They killed my girl and my baby.

01:08:39.198 --> 01:08:41.743
How the fuck do you think
that's gonna work itself out?

01:08:41.827 --> 01:08:44.162
What the fuck!
Fuck you!

01:08:44.578 --> 01:08:45.747
Fuck!

01:08:47.874 --> 01:08:50.627
Fuck.
Who do you think you are, huh?

01:08:50.710 --> 01:08:51.795
Who do you think you are?

01:08:51.877 --> 01:08:52.712
Fuck you!

01:08:52.796 --> 01:08:55.465
Where is the
product and my money!

01:08:55.549 --> 01:08:57.259
You do it my way!
All right?

01:08:57.341 --> 01:08:58.468
- Your way?
- My way!

01:08:58.551 --> 01:09:01.220
Your way?
Your fucking way?

01:09:01.304 --> 01:09:03.640
You want to hold my
money ransom, huh?

01:09:03.723 --> 01:09:05.725
I don't want your fucking money!
All right?

01:09:05.809 --> 01:09:08.185
I could've left with the
money and the fucking coke!

01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:11.231
I need to find these cops.

01:09:11.314 --> 01:09:14.734
And then these cops can
fuck you in your ass!

01:09:15.652 --> 01:09:19.823
You dumb fuck, you
don't fight dirty cops!

01:09:19.906 --> 01:09:21.741
You buy them, idiot!

01:09:23.493 --> 01:09:24.953
I'm a fucking idiot.

01:09:26.203 --> 01:09:29.249
They dragged your nephew
through the street like a dog.

01:09:33.295 --> 01:09:36.298
You wanna wait for them
to come to you with a deal?

01:09:42.179 --> 01:09:43.805
What kind of man are you?

01:09:47.309 --> 01:09:48.309
Huh?

01:09:51.062 --> 01:09:51.979
Hey.

01:09:52.063 --> 01:09:53.063
Fine.

01:10:03.783 --> 01:10:04.783
Okay.

01:10:06.953 --> 01:10:08.872
I help you find them-

01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:13.335
and you bring back
my money and their coke.

01:10:14.002 --> 01:10:14.878
Hmm?

01:10:14.961 --> 01:10:16.922
Skunk no longer works for you.

01:10:18.506 --> 01:10:19.633
So he can work for you?

01:10:19.716 --> 01:10:21.551
So he can do what he wants.

01:10:26.389 --> 01:10:27.432
Okay.

01:10:28.683 --> 01:10:31.728
Bring me these
dirty pigs' heads,

01:10:31.811 --> 01:10:33.772
and you can have him, okay?

01:10:46.868 --> 01:10:48.787
That's who set us
up at the deal.

01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:52.457
I need an address.

01:11:07.847 --> 01:11:09.641
Excuse me for a
moment, Congressman.

01:11:29.286 --> 01:11:30.412
Hey, Manning.

01:11:36.209 --> 01:11:39.421
GPS on the number puts
this Debo there an hour ago.

01:11:43.049 --> 01:11:44.592
Fucking mess here.

01:11:45.969 --> 01:11:48.430
I checked with NYPD,
still nothing on Diamond

01:11:48.513 --> 01:11:49.723
or your nephew.

01:11:50.974 --> 01:11:53.852
Would it kill you to put things
off until this blows over?

01:11:53.935 --> 01:11:55.270
It's impossible.

01:11:55.353 --> 01:11:58.023
I have two weeks before
this building's deal closes.

01:11:58.106 --> 01:11:59.417
What happened to
knowing when to walk?

01:11:59.441 --> 01:12:01.359
I ain't walking.

01:12:02.319 --> 01:12:05.071
You don't know the strings
I had to pull for this.

01:12:05.822 --> 01:12:08.033
I saw the strings on the way in.

01:12:09.659 --> 01:12:10.659
Nah.

01:12:28.553 --> 01:12:29.929
You all right, man?

01:12:35.101 --> 01:12:36.436
What is that?

01:12:36.519 --> 01:12:38.646
It's a HoHo, guy.
Never had a HoHo?

01:12:38.730 --> 01:12:40.148
No, the bottle.

01:12:40.231 --> 01:12:41.399
This?

01:12:41.483 --> 01:12:43.193
I got water in the fuel line.

01:12:44.944 --> 01:12:47.072
Feel good? I got the
Saturday Night special.

01:12:47.155 --> 01:12:48.406
It's a good gun, man.

01:12:48.490 --> 01:12:50.259
But you're not gonna get very
far with six shots, brother.

01:12:50.283 --> 01:12:51.743
Here, I got you this.
Take it.

01:12:54.579 --> 01:12:55.663
Good to go.

01:12:56.122 --> 01:12:57.499
Thanks.

01:12:57.582 --> 01:12:58.582
You ready?

01:13:02.170 --> 01:13:03.505
Let's roll, buddy.

01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:05.548
Highway to the danger zone.

01:13:45.255 --> 01:13:46.548
Who you with?

01:13:47.757 --> 01:13:51.928
Yeah, my boy told me to come
see Debo about buying some shit.

01:13:56.933 --> 01:13:57.851
Debo!

01:13:57.934 --> 01:13:59.519
Yeah, man. Yeah.

01:14:00.895 --> 01:14:02.564
He'll be with you.

01:15:34.197 --> 01:15:35.907
Don't you fucking move!

01:15:36.366 --> 01:15:38.117
Don't you fucking do it!

01:15:43.790 --> 01:15:44.624
You.

01:15:44.707 --> 01:15:46.042
You, who set us up?

01:15:46.125 --> 01:15:47.252
Listen.

01:15:48.044 --> 01:15:49.462
We did not set you up.

01:15:49.546 --> 01:15:50.547
No?

01:15:54.384 --> 01:15:55.635
How about now?

01:15:59.347 --> 01:16:02.016
Bokassa.
Bokassa, tell him the truth!

01:16:02.100 --> 01:16:03.017
Tell him!

01:16:03.101 --> 01:16:04.769
I have no choice!
I have no choice.

01:16:04.852 --> 01:16:06.312
Dirty swine comes
here every month.

01:16:06.396 --> 01:16:08.123
Every month they come
here to take the money.

01:16:08.147 --> 01:16:10.108
There are always
premium product to buy.

01:16:10.191 --> 01:16:11.776
But this time, I don't even...

01:16:14.696 --> 01:16:17.657
They wanted buyers, first timers
they could turn really quick.

01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:19.367
They set us all up!

01:16:20.076 --> 01:16:22.620
They set us up.
They said when they leave,

01:16:22.704 --> 01:16:24.372
that's it,
I'm not gonna see them anymore.

01:16:24.455 --> 01:16:25.748
They set us all up.

01:16:29.711 --> 01:16:30.980
All right, you're
gonna call them.

01:16:31.004 --> 01:16:32.213
That's not...

01:16:32.297 --> 01:16:33.798
Bokassa!

01:16:33.881 --> 01:16:35.758
Shut the fuck up!

01:16:36.134 --> 01:16:38.386
Get off you, you fucking fuck!

01:16:49.689 --> 01:16:50.815
Enough!

01:16:51.566 --> 01:16:53.276
I'm sick of these games.

01:16:53.359 --> 01:16:57.155
I'm not playing a fucking game!
I don't fucking know!

01:16:57.238 --> 01:16:58.615
You don't fucking know.

01:16:59.949 --> 01:17:01.868
I'm fucking sick of
your fucking fairy tales!

01:17:01.951 --> 01:17:04.078
- I don't fucking...
- You're a liar!

01:17:04.579 --> 01:17:05.997
That's a fucking lie!

01:17:06.581 --> 01:17:09.125
That's a fucking
lie and you know it!

01:17:12.503 --> 01:17:13.880
He doesn't know, bro.

01:17:24.349 --> 01:17:25.850
You wanna play, boy?

01:17:30.063 --> 01:17:31.397
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:17:31.481 --> 01:17:32.732
Come on, baby.

01:17:36.194 --> 01:17:37.904
You know, he's really
fucking pissed.

01:17:40.323 --> 01:17:42.158
You really fucked up today.

01:17:44.118 --> 01:17:45.703
Oh, come on! Come on!

01:17:45.787 --> 01:17:47.246
- What?
- Enough!

01:17:47.914 --> 01:17:49.666
Hold on. Hold on.
Just stop.

01:17:59.050 --> 01:18:00.677
Whoa, whoa, stop!

01:18:04.806 --> 01:18:05.806
Fuck it!

01:18:06.557 --> 01:18:07.892
No, no, no, no, no!

01:18:12.397 --> 01:18:15.608
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

01:18:40.216 --> 01:18:41.216
Aus.

01:18:41.342 --> 01:18:42.176
Aus.

01:18:42.260 --> 01:18:43.469
Good boy.

01:19:09.203 --> 01:19:10.955
You wanna end up
like your friend?

01:19:15.793 --> 01:19:18.838
I don't know where Moe is!

01:19:19.505 --> 01:19:23.426
I swear to fucking God
I don't know where Moe is!

01:19:23.509 --> 01:19:25.178
Don't fuck around!

01:19:25.762 --> 01:19:27.680
You say you wanna buy
what they have left.

01:19:27.764 --> 01:19:29.348
Tell them you have cash.

01:19:29.432 --> 01:19:30.516
All right?

01:19:34.771 --> 01:19:36.898
I just don't wanna die!

01:19:37.607 --> 01:19:38.274
Fucking hardass.

01:19:38.357 --> 01:19:40.318
I know where your product is.

01:19:40.401 --> 01:19:41.986
Where's the cash?

01:19:44.238 --> 01:19:46.699
It's in the same fucking place.

01:19:48.993 --> 01:19:50.328
He's fucking bluffing.

01:19:51.037 --> 01:19:52.330
He's fucking bluffing.

01:19:52.413 --> 01:19:54.457
How do I know you
won't fucking kill me?

01:19:54.540 --> 01:19:57.210
Huh? How do I fucking know?

01:19:59.962 --> 01:20:01.255
Feed him to the fucking dogs.

01:20:01.339 --> 01:20:03.466
Listen. Listen. Listen to me.
Listen.

01:20:03.549 --> 01:20:05.301
Slow down. Slow down. Slow down.

01:20:07.136 --> 01:20:10.473
Right now nobody knows that
the evidence is missing.

01:20:11.474 --> 01:20:15.102
And the Department
ain't gonna give a fuck

01:20:15.186 --> 01:20:16.646
about a few dead drug dealers.

01:20:17.730 --> 01:20:22.109
Your uncle may take it
to heart if we kill you.

01:20:23.903 --> 01:20:24.987
Son.

01:20:28.074 --> 01:20:29.283
The clock is ticking.

01:20:31.494 --> 01:20:34.705
And when it strikes-
you're the liability.

01:20:35.957 --> 01:20:37.291
So be smart.

01:20:38.751 --> 01:20:40.294
The ball's in your court, champ.

01:20:46.968 --> 01:20:48.594
The DeSoto.

01:20:52.014 --> 01:20:54.058
Room 1307.

01:20:58.729 --> 01:20:59.729
Hello.

01:20:59.772 --> 01:21:01.416
Hello.
I'm looking to purchase with a

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:03.234
product that you have.
I have cash.

01:21:05.069 --> 01:21:06.070
Yeah, yeah.

01:21:06.988 --> 01:21:08.155
Yeah, yeah.

01:21:08.865 --> 01:21:11.576
I hope the product
is as good as the sample.

01:21:12.577 --> 01:21:13.661
Okay, okay, okay.

01:21:14.161 --> 01:21:15.246
All right. Good.

01:21:16.205 --> 01:21:17.498
You got a car?

01:21:18.249 --> 01:21:20.001
Huh? You got a fucking car?

01:21:20.084 --> 01:21:20.960
Okay. Yeah.

01:21:21.043 --> 01:21:22.128
- Yeah?
- Okay.

01:21:24.297 --> 01:21:25.840
I'm sorry, all right?

01:21:25.923 --> 01:21:27.341
I didn't wanna fucking hurt you.

01:21:28.926 --> 01:21:30.344
Bokassa.

01:21:30.428 --> 01:21:31.428
Debo!

01:21:31.888 --> 01:21:32.930
Bokassa.

01:21:34.599 --> 01:21:35.600
Bokassa!

01:21:43.733 --> 01:21:44.817
Fuck, man!

01:21:49.614 --> 01:21:50.614
Move!

01:21:51.073 --> 01:21:52.673
Yo, Hines,
where the fuck you at?

01:21:54.327 --> 01:21:56.555
If this shit ain't where you
fucking say, you're gonna wish

01:21:56.579 --> 01:21:58.623
you were never fucking born.
You know that, right?

01:22:00.249 --> 01:22:01.375
Keep him alive.

01:22:01.459 --> 01:22:03.044
We might need him
to get to his uncle.

01:22:58.683 --> 01:22:59.850
Thank you.

01:23:00.309 --> 01:23:01.560
Hello! Housekeeping!

01:23:13.781 --> 01:23:15.616
Nice. Look at what we got.

01:23:20.955 --> 01:23:22.331
There's no fucking cash.

01:23:29.755 --> 01:23:30.923
There's no cash.

01:23:31.966 --> 01:23:33.551
All they want is the money.

01:23:33.634 --> 01:23:36.303
All right? You let them
rip you off, you're done.

01:23:40.891 --> 01:23:42.393
You'll be okay.

01:24:10.755 --> 01:24:11.756
Oh fuck.

01:24:23.225 --> 01:24:24.643
You got the product?

01:24:31.776 --> 01:24:33.027
Where's my shit?

01:25:09.772 --> 01:25:11.023
What's up, man?

01:25:13.150 --> 01:25:15.111
Why did your boss
change his mind?

01:25:15.194 --> 01:25:18.656
Bokassa, he knows a great
deal when he sees one.

01:25:18.739 --> 01:25:20.282
Yeah, I bet.

01:25:25.621 --> 01:25:27.248
Where the fuck's the cash?

01:25:36.882 --> 01:25:37.883
Fuck.

01:25:53.149 --> 01:25:54.233
Wow.

01:25:54.316 --> 01:25:55.985
Fucking guy brought
the cash to the deal.

01:25:56.068 --> 01:25:58.279
Un-fucking-believable.

01:26:24.180 --> 01:26:25.472
Oh, fuck.

01:27:55.396 --> 01:27:57.940
O'Donnel...
we got the product.

01:28:03.654 --> 01:28:04.822
That's beautiful.

01:28:04.905 --> 01:28:06.800
Now, we can't get in till
after the shift change.

01:28:06.824 --> 01:28:09.410
That's fine.
We got shit to take care of.

01:28:10.327 --> 01:28:11.996
I'll let you know
when it's done.

01:28:14.623 --> 01:28:15.958
What the fuck he say, man?

01:28:16.041 --> 01:28:17.084
We're good.

01:28:18.335 --> 01:28:20.455
Nobody knows about the
evidence missing from a locker.

01:28:20.504 --> 01:28:21.856
We take it there
tonight, we're done.

01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:23.882
What about the cash?

01:28:23.966 --> 01:28:25.801
Man, fuck O'Donnell.
We split it three ways.

01:28:26.510 --> 01:28:29.096
Fucking good with me,
man. Man, let's fucking do it.

01:28:30.431 --> 01:28:31.515
Go. Clean it up.

01:28:32.141 --> 01:28:35.019
Hines, you head back
and wait for us at the station.

01:28:35.102 --> 01:28:36.103
Alright, Man.

01:29:02.171 --> 01:29:03.881
Please tell me it was there!

01:29:05.132 --> 01:29:06.550
Yeah, yeah, it was half there.

01:29:08.177 --> 01:29:09.386
That's all right.

01:29:10.304 --> 01:29:11.430
God shined His light,

01:29:11.513 --> 01:29:12.973
and everything is
gonna be all right.

01:29:15.351 --> 01:29:16.560
So, you ready?

01:29:17.394 --> 01:29:18.437
To meet your maker?

01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:19.980
No!

01:29:27.404 --> 01:29:29.573
That's enough!
He's already half dead!

01:29:29.656 --> 01:29:31.116
You fuck.

01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:33.118
Moe. Moe, let me out.

01:29:33.911 --> 01:29:35.079
Tinez?

01:29:37.831 --> 01:29:38.749
Hey, Moe...

01:29:38.832 --> 01:29:40.209
Sh-sh-sh...

01:29:41.377 --> 01:29:42.461
Lie back.
You're dead.

01:29:42.544 --> 01:29:44.088
Okay. Okay.

01:29:56.934 --> 01:29:58.560
Martinez?

01:30:03.357 --> 01:30:04.650
This fucking guy now.

01:30:06.819 --> 01:30:08.278
The fuck you go?

01:30:14.993 --> 01:30:16.495
Where is this guy?

01:30:33.220 --> 01:30:33.762
Oh, shit!

01:30:50.028 --> 01:30:51.321
You really shot me.

01:30:56.827 --> 01:30:58.203
You can't kill a cop, man.

01:31:22.561 --> 01:31:23.812
Moe, let me out!

01:31:23.896 --> 01:31:25.022
Moe. Moe.

01:31:26.356 --> 01:31:27.483
What are you doing?

01:31:27.566 --> 01:31:28.775
No, Moe, Moe, Moe!

01:31:29.776 --> 01:31:31.487
Moe! Moe, stop! No!

01:31:31.570 --> 01:31:32.613
Moe, stop!

01:33:03.579 --> 01:33:04.579
It's over.

01:33:05.664 --> 01:33:06.748
It's over.

01:33:07.165 --> 01:33:08.750
They killed Lola.

01:33:10.127 --> 01:33:11.295
Holy fuck.

01:33:11.962 --> 01:33:14.172
Moe, I'm so sorry.

01:33:15.299 --> 01:33:16.925
I'm so sorry.

01:33:17.009 --> 01:33:19.761
Listen.
We can leave now.

01:33:19.845 --> 01:33:22.639
Let's just go.
You know, we could go anywhere.

01:33:26.768 --> 01:33:28.770
We finish with your uncle first.

01:34:12.397 --> 01:34:14.066
It is what it is.

01:34:14.149 --> 01:34:17.027
You think I'm holding out,
you take the deal down yourself.

01:34:17.110 --> 01:34:19.005
Come on,
man, you know I don't have the

01:34:19.029 --> 01:34:20.405
money to do this on my own.

01:34:23.909 --> 01:34:25.702
All right, man. Fuck.

01:34:25.786 --> 01:34:28.038
So, what am I supposed to
tell Debo when he calls?

01:34:28.121 --> 01:34:29.414
I'm coming or what?

01:34:29.498 --> 01:34:32.417
No, we'll
We'll talk our way through it.

01:34:33.502 --> 01:34:35.087
Listen. Regardless of

01:34:35.170 --> 01:34:38.173
what happens we meet
tonight at the club at 2:00.

01:35:13.250 --> 01:35:14.042
Yeah.

01:35:14.126 --> 01:35:16.169
Hey, your nephew's fucked.

01:35:16.253 --> 01:35:18.630
- Fucked how?
- I'm sending you a recording.

01:35:18.714 --> 01:35:20.716
Listen and delete
it immediately.

01:35:21.925 --> 01:35:23.927
You got an hour
tops to clean up.

01:35:24.010 --> 01:35:25.011
You understand?

01:35:25.095 --> 01:35:26.847
Get me a clean
cell phone number.

01:35:31.518 --> 01:35:35.772
2-1-2-5-5-50-1-6-8.

01:36:06.303 --> 01:36:07.137
Yo!

01:36:07.220 --> 01:36:09.222
What the fuck
happened to you, man?

01:36:09.306 --> 01:36:11.349
I'm all right.
It's okay.

01:36:11.433 --> 01:36:14.186
Yo, dude, what the...
Here, I got you.

01:36:19.232 --> 01:36:20.752
Let's go and get this
fucking guy, man.

01:36:23.862 --> 01:36:25.447
Dude, look at your fucking face.

01:36:25.530 --> 01:36:26.740
Yeah, I fucking know.

01:36:57.687 --> 01:36:59.356
Crazy motherfucker!

01:37:04.736 --> 01:37:06.613
I didn't mean this literally.

01:37:12.452 --> 01:37:13.870
I have to give it to you.

01:37:13.954 --> 01:37:17.541
A man of his word is
hard to come by these days.

01:37:18.667 --> 01:37:23.922
If only this wasn't all a
twisted fucking fairy tale.

01:37:27.551 --> 01:37:30.053
It's done now, so we're leaving.

01:37:33.348 --> 01:37:34.951
What are you doing?
He brought back your money!

01:37:34.975 --> 01:37:36.518
We're leaving,
just like you said!

01:37:36.601 --> 01:37:39.354
Yeah.
Let me talk to Bobby alone.

01:37:47.028 --> 01:37:48.446
- Bobby.
- He fixed it!

01:37:48.530 --> 01:37:49.948
- Bobby.
- It's over!

01:37:50.031 --> 01:37:51.031
Bobby!

01:37:54.452 --> 01:37:55.787
Oohh!

01:37:55.871 --> 01:37:57.956
He just cancelled
the rest of the pick-ups.

01:37:58.039 --> 01:37:59.541
Aaah, why?

01:37:59.624 --> 01:38:01.710
I don't know. He just
wants us to hold the money

01:38:01.793 --> 01:38:04.212
and stay the fuck away from
the garage until tomorrow.

01:38:04.296 --> 01:38:06.131
I mean, what if
it's all off, man?

01:38:06.214 --> 01:38:08.109
This was our chance to
start something on our own!

01:38:08.133 --> 01:38:09.527
All right, all right.
Calm down.

01:38:09.551 --> 01:38:11.720
All he did is delay things
until tomorrow, right?

01:38:11.803 --> 01:38:13.739
I knew he would do this.
He doesn't trust you.

01:38:13.763 --> 01:38:15.003
Why wouldn't he trust me?

01:38:15.056 --> 01:38:17.337
He doesn't trust me,
so he can't trust you either.

01:38:17.392 --> 01:38:20.687
What-what...
What is that?

01:38:21.938 --> 01:38:25.108
Jersey City Police
recovered voice recorder.

01:38:27.485 --> 01:38:28.778
Jersey City?

01:38:30.530 --> 01:38:32.324
The hospital you dropped him at.

01:38:39.414 --> 01:38:40.957
Bobby-

01:38:42.042 --> 01:38:45.003
the man sitting in that
room is a undercover cop.

01:38:47.923 --> 01:38:50.926
Cop you introduced all over
this city as your friend!

01:38:55.847 --> 01:39:00.435
Cop you've set a dozen
laundering deals with.

01:39:04.522 --> 01:39:07.484
A cop who will lead
to hundreds of arrests!

01:39:13.698 --> 01:39:16.701
His real name is Killerman.

01:39:18.411 --> 01:39:20.205
Frank Killerman.

01:39:24.584 --> 01:39:26.753
But... No!

01:39:26.836 --> 01:39:28.213
He hacked their heads off!

01:39:28.296 --> 01:39:30.048
I mean how could a cop do that?

01:39:30.131 --> 01:39:32.759
He doesn't know he's a cop!
He did it because

01:39:32.842 --> 01:39:35.679
they killed his baby and
almost killed his girl!

01:39:38.139 --> 01:39:39.474
Lola's not dead?

01:39:40.850 --> 01:39:42.310
No, she's not dead.

01:39:44.813 --> 01:39:47.649
They shot her,
but she's not dead.

01:39:48.525 --> 01:39:50.485
His rat of a baby is.

01:39:54.364 --> 01:39:55.865
It was all a lie?

01:39:57.158 --> 01:39:58.785
Everything that he said?

01:39:59.869 --> 01:40:02.872
So what, your
feelings are hurt a lot?

01:40:02.956 --> 01:40:04.416
Are you kidding me?

01:40:04.874 --> 01:40:07.377
He will put you in jail
for rest of your life!

01:40:09.170 --> 01:40:11.715
His pregnant girlfriend
didn't know his real name!

01:40:12.424 --> 01:40:15.135
What kind of animal
lives like that?

01:40:15.218 --> 01:40:17.095
You have to be snake!

01:40:17.178 --> 01:40:19.764
Dirty back-stabbing snake!

01:40:24.144 --> 01:40:25.645
What are you...

01:40:28.565 --> 01:40:30.984
What are you doing?

01:40:31.067 --> 01:40:32.067
Bobby.

01:40:34.237 --> 01:40:36.573
Bobby, you're like a son to me.

01:40:38.408 --> 01:40:40.452
I would never lead you astray.

01:40:42.662 --> 01:40:44.372
But you brought him here.

01:40:46.875 --> 01:40:49.419
You open us up to this.

01:40:52.130 --> 01:40:53.757
And you will finish it.

01:41:06.686 --> 01:41:08.063
He came for me.

01:41:12.776 --> 01:41:15.195
They would've killed
me if he didn't come.

01:41:16.196 --> 01:41:17.447
I understand.

01:41:19.866 --> 01:41:21.659
Empty it in his head.

01:41:31.544 --> 01:41:32.754
I'm the one.

01:41:33.713 --> 01:41:35.715
I wanna be the one to tell him.

01:41:42.305 --> 01:41:43.305
Good.

01:41:45.475 --> 01:41:46.601
Good.

01:41:48.770 --> 01:41:50.146
Bring him in.

01:42:24.055 --> 01:42:25.932
You fucked me, man!

01:42:26.015 --> 01:42:28.726
You really fucked me up, man!

01:42:28.810 --> 01:42:30.895
Skunk, what the fuck
are you doing, man?

01:42:33.106 --> 01:42:34.106
Tell him!

01:42:34.357 --> 01:42:35.233
Tell him!

01:42:35.316 --> 01:42:36.234
Fuck!

01:42:36.317 --> 01:42:39.237
Fuck! Fuck!

01:42:39.320 --> 01:42:40.655
You dirty fuck!

01:42:44.075 --> 01:42:45.785
Fuck!

01:42:46.369 --> 01:42:47.412
Fuck!

01:42:50.081 --> 01:42:51.082
Fuck!

01:42:51.791 --> 01:42:52.917
Fuck!

01:42:58.923 --> 01:43:01.050
What the fuck just
happened, man?

01:43:04.846 --> 01:43:05.722
Skunk.

01:43:05.805 --> 01:43:07.473
What the fuck, man?

01:43:11.352 --> 01:43:13.396
He wanted me to kill you.

01:43:13.938 --> 01:43:15.356
You killed the cops.

01:43:15.440 --> 01:43:16.649
You weren't worth the risk.

01:43:39.172 --> 01:43:40.715
What was he talking about?

01:43:42.884 --> 01:43:44.427
Tell me what?

01:43:50.308 --> 01:43:52.435
That I choose him over you.

01:44:04.239 --> 01:44:07.158
He wasn't gonna let either one
of us walk out of here alive.

01:44:09.911 --> 01:44:11.120
It's over.

01:44:12.038 --> 01:44:13.414
Just you and me now.

01:44:15.458 --> 01:44:16.876
Come on, we gotta go.
