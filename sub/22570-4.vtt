WEBVTT

00:23.200 --> 00:25.300
(Urine splashing)

00:35.667 --> 00:40.533
* Will you search through
the lonely earth for me?

00:40.567 --> 00:45.233
* Climb through
the briar and bramble?

00:45.267 --> 00:50.533
* I'll be your treasure

00:50.567 --> 00:53.467
* I'm waiting for you

00:54.833 --> 00:58.167
* I'm waiting for you

00:59.100 --> 01:01.033
(Bird squawking)

01:09.133 --> 01:11.367
Morning. You sleep at all?

01:11.400 --> 01:15.167
No, I needed a wee most of
the night, but I was too scared.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.533
- Of what?
- I don't know.

01:17.567 --> 01:20.733
Ghosts, I think, or a wolf.

01:20.767 --> 01:23.267
- Did you check the spot?
- Yeah.

01:23.300 --> 01:26.500
- Anything?
- Nah. There's definitely more.

01:26.533 --> 01:30.400
That's why they were watching.
I figured it out.

01:30.433 --> 01:34.433
- Who's watching what?
- I figured it out in the night.

01:34.467 --> 01:38.133
The magpies have been watching
this spot for centuries,

01:38.167 --> 01:41.033
successive generations of them.

01:41.067 --> 01:44.033
The magpies know
there's more down there.

01:44.067 --> 01:47.333
You're sounding a bit mystical.

01:47.367 --> 01:51.633
No, makes sense.
Magpies love shiny things.

01:51.667 --> 01:53.300
Yeah, but they don't
pass stories

01:53.333 --> 01:55.500
- to their kids and grandkids.
- How do you know?

01:55.533 --> 01:58.800
Might be some sort of
collective genetic memory.

01:58.833 --> 02:00.267
Do you want a cup of tea?

02:08.366 --> 02:10.500
How do I catch a magpie?

02:11.567 --> 02:13.700
- Alive?
- Yeah.

02:13.733 --> 02:16.500
- With utmost difficulty, mate.
- You reckon?

02:16.533 --> 02:19.367
Are you joking?
What are your ideas?

02:19.400 --> 02:22.467
What's top of your list
of ways to catch a live magpie?

02:22.500 --> 02:24.500
- Net.
- What kind of net?

02:24.533 --> 02:29.333
- A big one, like a landing net.
- What, and just creep up on it?

02:29.367 --> 02:31.733
Sit in a hide?

02:31.767 --> 02:36.067
- Put bait out.
- Good luck with that.

02:36.100 --> 02:39.333
What you gonna do once you've
caught it? Interrogate it?

02:39.367 --> 02:42.833
I reckon that they're
hoarding it all in one place -

02:42.867 --> 02:44.333
the gold coins.

02:44.367 --> 02:46.467
So if we could catch a magpie

02:46.500 --> 02:49.300
and attach a tracking device
or a camera,

02:49.333 --> 02:53.167
get it to take another coin,
we could watch where it goes.

02:53.200 --> 02:55.400
I think you might have
a urine infection, mate.

02:55.433 --> 02:57.300
You held on to it for too long.

02:57.333 --> 02:59.367
Ah, well...

03:00.433 --> 03:03.167
..I have to try.

03:03.200 --> 03:06.067
- You going up the club Monday?
- What's happening?

03:06.100 --> 03:09.467
Varde's giving a talk
on the NCP hoard.

03:09.500 --> 03:12.133
- What's NCP stand for?
- I don't know.

03:12.167 --> 03:16.100
National Car Parks, isn't it?
I might be late, I'm working.

03:16.133 --> 03:17.433
You told me you quit your job.

03:17.467 --> 03:20.567
I did. I've signed up again
with a temping agency:

03:20.600 --> 03:22.800
weed-killing on the A414.

03:22.833 --> 03:25.467
Nice!

03:25.500 --> 03:29.433
I'm not in till Tuesday, so I...
I thought I might stay here,

03:29.467 --> 03:32.200
guard the place.

03:32.233 --> 03:34.167
Are you avoiding your flat?

03:37.200 --> 03:38.800
No.

03:53.433 --> 03:56.600
Hello.
Have you come about the boiler?

03:56.633 --> 03:58.267
I'm looking for Lance.
Is he here?

03:58.300 --> 04:01.100
- No. Is it about the boiler?
- What?

04:01.133 --> 04:06.500
- No, sorry. Who are you?
- I'm Maggie, Lance's ex.

04:06.533 --> 04:12.067
- Who are you?
- I'm Toni, Lance's current.

04:12.100 --> 04:14.700
"Currant?"
What, like a sultana?

04:14.733 --> 04:16.533
No, current as in...

04:16.567 --> 04:20.466
Oh, my God!
Oh, are you Lance's girlfriend?

04:20.500 --> 04:22.067
Oh! (Laughs)

04:22.100 --> 04:26.367
Oh, I'm so sorry, I thought
you meant like a raisin.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.067
Oh! (Laughs)

04:28.867 --> 04:30.667
Did he not tell you?

04:30.700 --> 04:33.467
Oh, my God,
this must look awful,

04:33.500 --> 04:35.633
me standing here in my slippers.

04:35.667 --> 04:38.367
No, he's just letting me stay
in his daughter's room

04:38.400 --> 04:40.200
while she's away.

04:40.233 --> 04:42.533
Come in. Come in!

04:43.467 --> 04:45.233
Oh!

04:46.533 --> 04:48.700
- Kate's gone away?
- Yeah.

04:48.733 --> 04:51.533
She borrowed his car,
his little yellow TVR,

04:51.567 --> 04:55.100
while he's off camping
or something.

04:55.133 --> 04:58.167
So...you're his girlfriend.

04:59.333 --> 05:01.267
Let's have a look at you.

05:03.133 --> 05:07.267
Ah... You're not
how I thought you'd be.

05:07.300 --> 05:09.600
I thought you'd be more, like,
you know...

05:09.633 --> 05:10.733
Like what?

05:10.767 --> 05:12.367
Well, he used to be
married to me,

05:12.400 --> 05:15.467
so someone more like, you know,
nice clothes, bit of makeup,

05:15.500 --> 05:17.767
not so...tomboy-ish.

05:17.800 --> 05:19.533
What's your name again?

05:19.567 --> 05:22.033
- Trevor?
- Toni.

05:22.067 --> 05:24.433
Oh. (Laughs)
Oh, how funny.

05:24.467 --> 05:27.800
No, you look cute in that.

05:27.833 --> 05:29.467
I mean, it wouldn't suit me.

05:29.500 --> 05:33.833
People expect me to have nice
clean nails in my line of work.

05:33.867 --> 05:36.133
- What's your line of work?
- I'm an author.

05:36.167 --> 05:37.400
- Are you?
- Yeah.

05:40.800 --> 05:45.167
Yeah, I've had a bit of a tidy
up. Place was in a right state.

05:45.200 --> 05:47.633
He needs someone
looking after him, that man.

05:50.300 --> 05:53.000
- Are you a Scorpio?
- No.

05:55.433 --> 05:57.700
Do you want me to tell him
you were here?

05:57.733 --> 05:59.567
If you want.

06:04.700 --> 06:07.500
- (Opens door)
- See you.

06:07.533 --> 06:09.467
(Door slams)

06:12.133 --> 06:14.400
All right, Steve.
These the new spares, are they?

06:14.433 --> 06:17.300
Yeah, they're the new ones.
You fill the tanks with water?

06:17.333 --> 06:19.167
- Yes, just water in there.
- OK, well,

06:19.200 --> 06:21.433
put half a bottle
of that in each tank.

06:21.467 --> 06:23.633
Don't get it on your hands
and don't breathe it in.

06:40.333 --> 06:42.333
- All right?
- Yeah, that's all done, yeah.

06:46.400 --> 06:48.200
- Don't forget your...
- Ah.

08:42.700 --> 08:44.200
- You need filling up?
- Yeah.

08:44.232 --> 08:46.033
- Give it here, I'll do it.
- Cheers.

09:20.267 --> 09:22.033
(Chirrups)

09:38.500 --> 09:40.267
(Chirrups)

10:15.700 --> 10:18.400
(Smattering of applause)

10:27.767 --> 10:30.133
Thank you, Varde.

10:30.167 --> 10:33.633
Very interesting talk
on a fascinating hoard.

10:33.667 --> 10:35.567
And, as ever with these things,

10:35.600 --> 10:37.633
it throws up more questions
than it answers.

10:37.667 --> 10:41.500
Why were so many national
cycling proficiency badges

10:41.533 --> 10:43.233
buried together?

10:43.267 --> 10:46.033
- And by whom?
- Hell's Angels.

10:46.067 --> 10:47.400
Lance Armstrong.

10:47.433 --> 10:49.433
TERRY: Any other questions
for Varde

10:49.467 --> 10:51.267
before she rests her voice?

10:51.300 --> 10:53.733
You must be quiet hoarse
after that marathon.

10:54.867 --> 10:56.367
No questions?

10:56.400 --> 10:57.800
OK, moving on.

10:57.833 --> 11:01.800
Lance, you got any further
tracing your stolen coin?

11:01.833 --> 11:03.700
Oh, I've given up with that,
Teriyaki.

11:03.733 --> 11:06.233
I've been chasing magpies
for the last two days.

11:06.267 --> 11:07.733
That's good.

11:07.767 --> 11:11.833
Birdwatching's very good
for the soul, it's calming.

11:11.867 --> 11:14.400
Yeah, not this type
of birdwatching, Sheila.

11:14.433 --> 11:17.567
This is angry birdwatching
for monetary gain.

11:17.600 --> 11:20.467
He wanted to catch one
and strap a camera to it.

11:20.500 --> 11:21.733
I left a coin there,

11:21.767 --> 11:24.267
but they didn't touch it,
cos they knew it wasn't gold.

11:24.300 --> 11:27.233
ANDY: They didn't touch it, cos
you was next to it with a net.

11:27.267 --> 11:29.833
Actually, Varde had an idea
about that, didn't you?

11:29.867 --> 11:32.233
Varde was saying that magpies,
you know,

11:32.267 --> 11:34.833
being part of the corvid family,
are highly-intelligent.

11:34.867 --> 11:37.167
So, you could,
given time, gain its trust

11:37.200 --> 11:39.500
and get it to take things
from you.

11:39.533 --> 11:42.167
It's all very well
you saying that, Varde.

11:42.200 --> 11:44.700
I haven't got the time
to tame a magpie!

11:44.733 --> 11:47.033
We lose that land
in three weeks.

11:47.067 --> 11:50.133
Honestly,
you're all talk sometimes.

11:50.167 --> 11:52.733
Are you sure
you're not just using

11:52.767 --> 11:55.067
this temporary magpie obsession

11:55.100 --> 11:57.067
to block out the difficulties

11:57.100 --> 12:00.067
you're having
in your private life?

12:00.100 --> 12:02.800
- I was just going to say that.
HUGH: Me, too.

12:02.833 --> 12:05.833
It seems like you're focussing
too much on magpies

12:05.867 --> 12:07.800
and not on your real problems.

12:13.167 --> 12:14.667
No!

12:14.700 --> 12:18.367
Anyway, I'm done with
the gold coins and the magpies.

12:18.400 --> 12:21.667
You were right...
I'm gonna let that one go.

12:31.700 --> 12:33.633
Pint of Stella, please, Mike.

12:38.567 --> 12:40.800
Hiya, Toni love, it's me.

12:42.400 --> 12:44.200
You haven't been
returning my calls,

12:44.233 --> 12:46.833
so I was just wondering
if everything's all right.

12:46.867 --> 12:50.333
Anyway, give us a ring
when you get this message,

12:50.367 --> 12:53.300
otherwise I'll...I'll probably
see you at work.

12:54.067 --> 12:55.667
Bye.

12:57.400 --> 12:58.500
Cheers, Michael.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.267
Sure I can't
tempt anyone to stay?

13:06.300 --> 13:09.033
No, no, gotta be fresh for
Bollywood class in the morning.

13:09.067 --> 13:10.567
SHEILA: Terry's favourite.

13:10.600 --> 13:13.167
LANCE: Oh, yeah, you like
the old Bollywood, do you?

13:13.200 --> 13:15.667
- Oh, yes.
- He's very good.

13:15.700 --> 13:18.500
He could be in the movies.

13:18.533 --> 13:21.833
If he dyed his moustache
and learnt to speak Hindi.

13:21.867 --> 13:23.767
SHEILA: Bye, all.
- See you.

13:23.800 --> 13:26.500
TERRY: Ta-ra, night.

13:26.533 --> 13:28.833
ANDY: You all right?
You gonna stay on your own?

13:28.867 --> 13:32.367
Yeah, I've got my magazine,
you know, and...

13:32.400 --> 13:34.733
I'm just gonna give it
another hour.

13:34.767 --> 13:37.200
Wait for Mags to go to bed.

13:37.233 --> 13:39.133
Bloody hell, mate,
that's no way to live.

13:39.167 --> 13:41.100
- Won't be for long.
- I can stay for another,

13:41.133 --> 13:42.367
but I've gotta be up early -

13:42.400 --> 13:44.300
pressure-hosing chewing gum
in Chelmsford.

13:44.333 --> 13:45.767
- Charming.
- Cheerio.

13:45.800 --> 13:47.567
Cheers.

13:56.800 --> 13:58.133
(Exhales heavily)

14:05.100 --> 14:07.267
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:07.300 --> 14:11.100
- Mmm, beer and Scout hall.
- You love it.

14:11.133 --> 14:14.233
- I do. How was the club?
- Same.

14:14.267 --> 14:16.500
I can't imagine
what you have to talk about.

14:16.533 --> 14:19.300
- Do you meet weekly?
- Very weekly sometimes.

14:19.333 --> 14:22.133
Usually just turns into a
therapy session, if I'm honest.

14:22.167 --> 14:23.733
I would love to be
a fly on the wall.

14:23.767 --> 14:26.400
You don't have to be a fly on
the wall. You can come along.

14:26.433 --> 14:29.367
No. Ooh, I found a couple more
flats I want to see.

14:29.400 --> 14:31.800
- Are you working tomorrow?
- Afraid so, in Colchester.

14:31.833 --> 14:33.767
- Oh.
- Where were you today?

14:33.800 --> 14:35.800
- Colchester, the same.
- All day?

14:35.833 --> 14:37.333
Till four, yeah.

14:37.367 --> 14:38.600
Andy uncovered a portion

14:38.633 --> 14:40.633
of Roman mosaic last week,
didn't you?

14:40.667 --> 14:43.033
I did, yeah. We were hoping
there was gonna be more,

14:43.067 --> 14:45.333
but we only turned up
medieval stuff today.

14:45.367 --> 14:50.200
Didn't I see you on the A414,
outside Mornam?

14:50.233 --> 14:53.500
Pardon?
No. No, I was in Colchester.

14:53.533 --> 14:56.100
Looked like you, lunch time,

14:56.133 --> 14:58.600
spraying the weeds
on the hard shoulder.

14:58.633 --> 15:02.367
No. No. I don't know
who that could have been.

15:02.400 --> 15:05.100
Well, if it wasn't you, why
would you know who it was?

15:05.133 --> 15:06.600
Exactly, could've been anyone.

15:06.633 --> 15:08.500
I'm gonna hit the sack.
Are you coming up?

15:08.533 --> 15:10.467
- Yeah, I won't be long.
- Good night.

15:20.200 --> 15:21.500
What was that for?

15:21.533 --> 15:23.600
For lying about Kate
not taking your car.

15:23.633 --> 15:26.367
Oh. How'd you find out?

15:27.767 --> 15:29.633
I came by your flat.

15:29.667 --> 15:31.467
- And the car wasn't there?
- No.

15:31.500 --> 15:34.233
Was anyone else there?

15:34.267 --> 15:36.600
Yeah, your ex-wife Maggie
was there.

15:36.633 --> 15:38.767
Oh, right, yeah, listen,
I've made a mess...

15:38.800 --> 15:42.600
Look, could you stop throwing
potatoes just for a minute?

15:42.633 --> 15:44.233
I've made a mess of things.

15:44.267 --> 15:46.167
I should've told you,
but I panicked.

15:46.200 --> 15:47.600
You lied.

15:47.633 --> 15:50.200
I know,
but I thought I was doing it...

15:50.233 --> 15:53.267
Ohh! Please stop throwing
potatoes at me.

15:53.300 --> 15:55.567
I know I deserve
to have potatoes thrown at me,

15:55.600 --> 15:58.367
but it's very hard
to concentrate.

15:58.400 --> 16:01.500
There's going nothing on between
us. We're not back together.

16:01.533 --> 16:03.833
I never suggested
there was anything going on.

16:03.867 --> 16:06.533
If there's one thing I know
you're not, Lance, it's a cheat.

16:06.567 --> 16:08.767
Oh, well, thanks.

16:08.800 --> 16:10.533
But you're a liar and a coward.

16:12.367 --> 16:15.167
And those are two of my least
favourite character traits.

16:15.200 --> 16:16.333
I don't usually lie.

16:16.367 --> 16:19.100
You just thought you'd try it
out on me? You bastard.

16:19.133 --> 16:21.600
Lying is what breaks couples up,
didn't you know that?

16:21.633 --> 16:22.767
I didn't think.

16:22.800 --> 16:25.267
Another character trait
I don't like. That's three.

16:25.300 --> 16:26.600
- I'm an idiot.
- Four.

16:31.700 --> 16:34.600
For months now, whenever
I suggest staying at yours,

16:34.633 --> 16:37.367
you say Kate's there
and the place isn't your own

16:37.400 --> 16:38.833
and you don't feel comfortable.

16:38.867 --> 16:41.233
I've never said
I felt uncomfortable.

16:41.267 --> 16:43.300
I just wanted
to spend some time with you.

16:43.333 --> 16:46.100
But the moment your ex turns up,
you give Kate your car key,

16:46.133 --> 16:48.833
say, "Make yourself scarce,"
and the ex gets invited to stay.

16:48.867 --> 16:50.500
I couldn't turn her away,
could I?

16:50.533 --> 16:53.367
You turn me away
on a regular basis.

16:53.400 --> 16:56.133
Right, I'm gonna tell her,
she has to go.

16:56.167 --> 16:58.100
- Do what you want.
- Mags!

16:59.367 --> 17:01.000
My name's Toni, for fuck's sake!

17:47.433 --> 17:49.633
(Engine revs)

18:01.333 --> 18:03.267
(Engine revs)

18:20.067 --> 18:21.600
(Engine revs)

18:28.600 --> 18:30.433
How long
have you been waiting there?

18:30.467 --> 18:33.067
- Two days?
- No, I heard you coming.

18:33.100 --> 18:35.500
You don't need to rev so hard
when you're changing up.

18:35.533 --> 18:37.767
Shut up, Dad.

18:37.800 --> 18:40.467
I wasn't expecting
you back today.

18:40.500 --> 18:43.200
Came home early.
That's OK, isn't it?

18:46.100 --> 18:50.300
- So, how was she?
- She was grand. I love her.

18:50.333 --> 18:52.800
She smells of the '70s.

18:52.833 --> 18:55.667
Although I did back her
into a post and broke a light.

18:58.733 --> 19:00.467
- I'm kidding!
- Oh!

19:00.500 --> 19:02.700
- You got me going...
- Actually, I'm not kidding.

19:02.733 --> 19:05.500
I did break a light.
Don't know why I said I didn't.

19:05.533 --> 19:07.767
I felt like you wanted me
to say it, so I did.

19:07.800 --> 19:09.667
So you have broke a light,
or you haven't?

19:09.700 --> 19:13.467
I have. I'm sorry,
one of the back ones.

19:13.500 --> 19:15.767
I'm so sorry,
I will get it fixed.

19:17.467 --> 19:20.033
Doesn't matter, it's only a car.

19:20.067 --> 19:22.700
No, please,
don't be heartbroken.

19:22.733 --> 19:24.267
I thought you'd be angry.

19:24.300 --> 19:26.133
I thought I'd be saying,
"It's only a car."

19:26.167 --> 19:28.567
Yeah, it's just
one more thing, really.

19:28.600 --> 19:30.833
They say bad luck
comes in eights.

19:30.867 --> 19:33.200
Did you not have a nice time
without me?

19:33.233 --> 19:37.533
Unforeseen circumstances. I've
messed up a bit, upset Toni.

19:37.567 --> 19:40.600
- Oh, you're kidding?
- My ex-wife Maggie showed up.

19:40.633 --> 19:42.633
That was your ex-wife?

19:42.667 --> 19:44.700
Oh, my God,
I let her in the flat.

19:44.733 --> 19:47.367
No, I had to let her stay
anyway,

19:47.400 --> 19:49.333
cos she split up
with her partner

19:49.367 --> 19:51.200
and she was pretty cut up.

19:51.233 --> 19:53.300
So I let her sleep in your room.

19:53.333 --> 19:56.533
- So you didn't even see Toni?
- No.

19:59.800 --> 20:01.567
I'm sure you could patch it up,

20:01.600 --> 20:03.333
if she really means
that much to you.

20:03.367 --> 20:05.600
Yeah, there's a Triumph
specialist in Boughton,

20:05.633 --> 20:07.467
he's bound to have one in stock.

20:07.500 --> 20:10.333
- I meant Toni.
- Anyway, there's no rush,

20:10.367 --> 20:12.167
as long as I get to him
this afternoon,

20:12.200 --> 20:14.567
before he shuts at four.

20:14.600 --> 20:16.600
Actually, you know,
I better get on with it.

21:17.567 --> 21:20.100
Oh, I was thinking about
what you said yesterday,

21:20.133 --> 21:22.367
and I think I know
where you might've seen me.

21:22.400 --> 21:23.833
We did stop off in the afternoon

21:23.867 --> 21:26.500
to survey another site,
in Waldon.

21:28.067 --> 21:29.700
Yeah, I remember now.

21:29.733 --> 21:31.700
Those weren't sprayers
you saw us with.

21:31.733 --> 21:35.067
It was surveying equipment,
measuring sticks.

21:35.100 --> 21:38.533
Oh, don't tell lies.
Do you think I'm stupid?

21:38.567 --> 21:42.800
I know what I saw, and it wasn't
you being an archaeologist,

21:42.833 --> 21:45.567
but an agency worker...

21:45.600 --> 21:48.267
..spraying weed killer
on the hard shoulder.

21:49.367 --> 21:51.067
What's going on, Andy?

21:51.100 --> 21:54.700
It's just water.
I didn't put the weed killer in.

21:54.733 --> 21:58.133
- What is going on?
- (Sighs)

22:01.267 --> 22:02.767
I quit my job.

22:02.800 --> 22:07.167
- Quit or lost?
- Quit. It was a scam.

22:07.200 --> 22:09.667
I did find a mosaic, and I'm
sure there was more of it,

22:09.700 --> 22:11.367
but it was scraped away
in the night

22:11.400 --> 22:13.433
before I had a chance
to find out.

22:13.467 --> 22:15.233
Because anything
interesting found

22:15.267 --> 22:17.733
would just delay construction
of this office block.

22:17.767 --> 22:20.000
So then you quit
for the right reasons.

22:20.767 --> 22:22.433
Thanks.

22:22.467 --> 22:25.633
So what makes you think
my daughter wouldn't understand?

22:25.667 --> 22:27.500
Well, because
she wants to buy a flat,

22:27.533 --> 22:29.600
and she's worried
about Stan's schooling.

22:29.633 --> 22:32.567
And...I think she'd rather
I just bit my tongue for a while

22:32.600 --> 22:34.100
until we can afford a home.

22:34.133 --> 22:37.233
I think you'll find
that ethics and principles

22:37.267 --> 22:40.367
stand pretty high
on my daughter's agenda.

22:40.400 --> 22:43.233
Yeah, I know, I didn't mean...

22:43.267 --> 22:46.367
I'm just very aware that
after all those years studying,

22:46.400 --> 22:50.300
I'm not making much of a success
of being an archaeologist.

22:50.333 --> 22:52.800
Well, maybe you're not
an archaeologist.

22:52.833 --> 22:55.733
Maybe you're more of a...
hobbyist.

22:57.300 --> 22:59.367
You can't make any money
from hobbies.

22:59.400 --> 23:01.400
- That's why they're hobbies.
- (Laughs)

23:01.433 --> 23:03.367
Maybe you're not
a money-maker either.

23:03.400 --> 23:05.167
What a guy.

23:06.733 --> 23:08.500
Sorry for lying.

23:19.167 --> 23:20.367
Ooh!

23:20.400 --> 23:21.667
(Door opens)

23:25.133 --> 23:26.400
(Door closes)

23:39.833 --> 23:41.767
(Hums tune)

23:56.667 --> 23:59.333
What are you looking for?

23:59.367 --> 24:01.500
Oh, my God!
You made me jump.

24:01.533 --> 24:03.200
What are you doing
sitting there?

24:03.233 --> 24:04.300
This is my room.

24:04.333 --> 24:06.700
I thought you weren't
coming back till tomorrow?

24:06.733 --> 24:08.633
Oh.

24:08.667 --> 24:12.233
I was just looking for
Lance's... TV licence.

24:12.267 --> 24:14.400
Do you know where
he keeps his TV licence?

24:14.433 --> 24:16.100
- It's not in there.
- Is it not?

24:16.133 --> 24:17.567
No.

24:19.533 --> 24:21.700
- You angry?
- I'm a little bit angry, yeah.

24:21.733 --> 24:25.400
Oh, don't be silly.
Come and have a cup of tea.

24:26.467 --> 24:27.800
God, you made me jump!

24:28.800 --> 24:30.300
Did you have a nice time?

24:30.333 --> 24:32.100
I can't believe
he lent you his car.

24:32.133 --> 24:34.133
He never used to let me
go near that thing,

24:34.167 --> 24:36.733
not to drive it anyway.

24:36.767 --> 24:40.233
Oh, I always hated
getting in and out of that car.

24:40.267 --> 24:43.100
I could never do it
without flashing my knickers.

24:43.133 --> 24:44.600
How long are you staying for?

24:44.633 --> 24:46.600
Not long.
Just until I sort myself out.

24:46.633 --> 24:48.667
You do know he's got
a girlfriend, don't you?

24:48.700 --> 24:51.333
Yeah, I met the current.

24:51.367 --> 24:53.200
She's a funny little thing,
isn't she?

24:53.233 --> 24:55.567
What are you doing here, Maggie?

24:55.600 --> 25:00.067
Oh, dear. Are you
a little bit jealous? Yeah?

25:00.100 --> 25:02.400
Have I upset
your cushy little number?

25:02.433 --> 25:05.200
Cos you must have it pretty easy
here, I suppose, have you?

25:05.233 --> 25:06.767
Treat the place like your own?

25:06.800 --> 25:09.500
Cos it was a right shit-hole
when I arrived.

25:09.533 --> 25:12.500
- What are you after?
- I'm not after anything, love.

25:12.533 --> 25:15.267
You're the one taking the piss.

25:15.300 --> 25:18.200
I don't suppose Lance has ever
told you about us, has he?

25:18.233 --> 25:20.300
Yeah, he told me
you left him for an arsehole.

25:20.333 --> 25:22.700
- Did he call him an arsehole?
- I think he did, yeah.

25:22.733 --> 25:24.200
That's rude.

25:24.233 --> 25:26.533
So what is it I need to know
about you and my dad?

25:26.567 --> 25:28.700
That we still have
a deep connection

25:28.733 --> 25:30.833
and we'll always be there
for one another.

25:30.867 --> 25:32.667
Mm,
he hadn't mentioned that, no.

25:32.700 --> 25:34.233
We have a spiritual bond

25:34.267 --> 25:37.233
forged at a pagan ceremony
at Avebury standing stones.

25:37.267 --> 25:39.133
He kept that one to himself,
too.

25:39.167 --> 25:43.433
I know what Lance wants,
I know what Lance needs.

25:48.467 --> 25:50.400
(Phone vibrates
and whistle alert)

25:59.800 --> 26:01.200
(Sighs)

26:01.233 --> 26:05.333
Oi! Lollipop!
Message from the Arsehole.

26:08.267 --> 26:12.700
I reckon about ten minutes,
15...

26:12.733 --> 26:16.300
for you to get your spells
and your potions out of my room

26:16.333 --> 26:19.167
and your bony arse
out of my dad's life.

26:25.200 --> 26:30.167
- Bony arse?
- Mm, yeah, apparently.

26:30.200 --> 26:32.467
- That's from Working Girl.
- (Laughs)

26:32.500 --> 26:37.133
That's what I said,
Melanie Griffiths.

26:37.167 --> 26:38.800
- What did the text say?
- (Exhales)

26:38.833 --> 26:41.667
Well, she wouldn't tell me,
only that it was him, you know,

26:41.700 --> 26:43.533
Pizza Hut manager.

26:43.567 --> 26:46.733
- She's gone now, Maggie?
- Yeah, again.

26:49.133 --> 26:51.100
Just gotta patch things up
with Toni.

26:53.500 --> 26:56.233
Connect 4? Did you bring games?

26:58.133 --> 26:59.567
While away the hours.

27:06.333 --> 27:09.833
- Where'd you get the KerPlunk?
- A charity shop.

27:09.867 --> 27:13.033
Yeah. You know, there isn't
a single charity shop

27:13.067 --> 27:15.733
that doesn't have a KerPlunk.

27:15.767 --> 27:18.433
Yeah, you should check it out.
They can't shift them.

27:18.467 --> 27:20.533
There's a Sue Ryder
in Colchester

27:20.567 --> 27:25.367
that has a sign in the window,
"No KerPlunks, thank you."

27:25.400 --> 27:28.133
ANDY: Cos it takes too long
to put the sticks back in.

27:30.233 --> 27:34.300
LANCE: If you take the time,
the rewards are obvious.

27:38.667 --> 27:42.267
Of course, it should really be
on a level playing surface.

27:44.167 --> 27:46.100
Your go.

27:47.433 --> 27:49.300
(Marbles clatter)

27:50.133 --> 27:51.733
ANDY: Balls.
