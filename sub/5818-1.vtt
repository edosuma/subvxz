DAMON: Previously on
The Vampire Diaries...

00:03.960 --> 00:07.442
REVEREND: Welcome to the wedding
of Alaric Saltzman and Josette Laugh/in.

00:08.760 --> 00:09.966
Miss me?

00:13.560 --> 00:15.449
Stefan! She won't wake up.

00:15.720 --> 00:18.769
So, Bonster,
I linked Elena's life to yours.

00:18.920 --> 00:21.605
As long as you're alive,
Elena will remain asleep.

00:21.760 --> 00:26.721
PASTOR: We are here today to pay
our respect to Sheriff Elizabeth Forbes.

00:26.960 --> 00:30.009
You and I. I can't do this right now.
I'm sorry.

00:30.240 --> 00:35.770
I understand if you need time to heal,
and if I have to wait for you, I will.

00:36.840 --> 00:38.490
- Who's that?
- It's my mother.

00:38.760 --> 00:41.001
JO: Before the 1900s,
Lily fell in with a group of witches

00:41.240 --> 00:42.924
that were cast out of the Gemini Coven.

00:43.120 --> 00:46.090
Heretics are ruthless.
Vampires with witch power.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.521
Lorenzo, it's our family.

00:50.320 --> 00:51.810
DAMON: It's time for me to say goodbye.

01:04.480 --> 01:05.766
(BELL RINGING)

01:09.760 --> 01:11.000

(COUGHS)

01:18.120 --> 01:19.326
(GRUNTS)

01:21.840 --> 01:23.808
Damon, wake up.

01:26.160 --> 01:28.481
I need you. Wake up.

01:30.280 --> 01:32.726
Damon, wake the hell up!

01:43.160 --> 01:44.161
CAROLI N E: Dear Elena.

01:44.800 --> 01:48.202
A few weeks ago, you said goodbye
and told us to write everything down

01:48.400 --> 01:50.687
so you'd feel like
you didn't miss anything when you woke up.

01:51.640 --> 01:52.687
Bad news first.

01:53.400 --> 01:56.529
Damon said the best way to keep his mind
off you was to help Alaric grieve.

01:57.360 --> 02:02.526
So, in Damon fashion, he kidnapped Ric
and flew him to Europe for a guy-getaway.

02:02.760 --> 02:05.001
I'm sure you can imagine how that's going.

02:05.200 --> 02:06.406
(CROWD CHANTING)

02:09.880 --> 02:10.881
(CROWD CHEERING)

02:11.160 --> 02:14.050
Obviously, we didn't send them there
without a chaperone.

02:14.200 --> 02:15.850
Drinkin'... Now.

02:16.160 --> 02:17.924
So, Damon's watching out for Alaric.

02:18.200 --> 02:19.611
Bonnie's watching out for Damon.

02:19.840 --> 02:23.083
And I don't know exactly
who's watching out for Bonnie.

02:23.280 --> 02:27.365
Matt will officially be Deputy Donovan
next week when he graduates.

02:27.560 --> 02:32.202
As happy as I am for him, a big pan' of me
wishes my mom was here to see it.

02:32.880 --> 02:34.803
The town council gave her a bench.

02:35.040 --> 02:38.567
I've been visiting it, hoping
I'll miraculously start missing her less.

02:40.440 --> 02:43.808
(SIGHS) I keep thinking that
if I can heal, I can move on with my life.

02:44.040 --> 02:47.567
But I don't see that happening
any time soon.

02:50.760 --> 02:53.047
Anyway, I covered Damon,

02:53.240 --> 02:55.129
Bonnie, Ric, Matt.

02:55.400 --> 02:56.765
Who am I missing?

02:56.920 --> 02:58.251
What you writing?

02:58.560 --> 03:01.131
Stefan, what are you doing here?

03:01.400 --> 03:03.402
Matt reported some blood bags missing
from the hospital,

03:03.600 --> 03:04.931
so I thought I'd check it out.

03:05.320 --> 03:06.481
Do you think it's your mom?

03:06.720 --> 03:09.769
If it's not, then she has quite literally
dropped off the face of the Earth.

03:10.400 --> 03:13.290
I'm still deciding
if that's a good thing or a bad thing.

03:14.280 --> 03:16.851
So, how's Damon?

03:17.440 --> 03:20.967
Well, if the last time he sat around
waiting decades for a girl

03:21.120 --> 03:23.441
taught us anything, then I am worried.

03:23.640 --> 03:26.769
(CHUCKLES) Well, if you're worried,
then I'm terrified.

03:34.480 --> 03:37.086
I made this a thing, didn't I?

03:37.520 --> 03:38.646
You made what a thing?

03:38.840 --> 03:41.764
Well, I told you how I felt about you
and now it's...

03:43.160 --> 03:44.161
It's weird.

03:44.360 --> 03:47.523
No! It's not weird, Stefan.

03:47.760 --> 03:49.762
You just asked about my brother,
who you hate,

03:50.000 --> 03:51.126
to fill awkward silence.

03:51.320 --> 03:54.005
Okay, I don't hate Damon. I'm just...

03:56.520 --> 03:59.330
Obviously, you know,

03:59.480 --> 04:02.484
-scrambling to fill the awkward silence.
- Right.

04:02.640 --> 04:06.486
Okay, it's a thing.
You made it a thing. Congratulations.

04:06.720 --> 04:08.370
All right, how about this, new rule.

04:08.640 --> 04:13.282
You live your life, you heal,
and in the meantime we're friends.

04:14.800 --> 04:16.005
I like that rule.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.490
- Good.
- Okay.

04:19.959 --> 04:21.644
- Happy writing.
- Thank you.

04:25.480 --> 04:28.211
CAROLINE:
As I was saying, things are great.

04:31.360 --> 04:33.840
VALERIE: Dear diary, I'm in hell.

04:34.040 --> 04:36.520
It's hard to imagine a place worse than
where I've come from,

04:36.680 --> 04:39.843
but by some spectacular miracle,
I've found it.

04:41.160 --> 04:44.801
In the week since I arrived,
three things are clear.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.287
The food is literally made of poison.

04:47.480 --> 04:49.164
The air smells like a plague.

04:49.720 --> 04:52.291
And everyone wants to know
what everyone else is doing.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.526
I don't fit in here, nor do I want to.

04:55.720 --> 04:58.121
This is not the world I imagined.

04:58.360 --> 04:59.566

-(TIRES SCREECHING)

05:02.320 --> 05:04.527
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
What did you do?

05:04.720 --> 05:05.960
I didn't think she'd walk
right into the street.

05:06.240 --> 05:07.685
Stu, Stu, we have to call 911.

05:07.880 --> 05:12.204
Shut up, okay? Let me think.
Okay, it's not like anyone saw us. Right?

05:12.720 --> 05:14.882
Are you insane? We can't just
leave her here. She's not moving!

05:15.080 --> 05:17.560
Look, we just smoked a joint, okay?
I'm high as a freakin' kite right now.

05:17.800 --> 05:19.370
Do you want me to go to jail?

05:20.400 --> 05:21.686
Let's go.

05:25.880 --> 05:27.086
(HONKS)

05:37.240 --> 05:40.369
VALERIE: As I was saying,
complete and utter hell.

05:42.080 --> 05:45.368
Not that my family
is making it any easier.

05:45.560 --> 05:49.007
Lily sequestered us away
in some musty, abandoned house.

05:49.240 --> 05:51.607
Stoic Beau, Nora, the brat.

05:51.760 --> 05:55.606
The devious, mental Mary Louise
and Malcolm, Lily's pet.

05:56.240 --> 05:58.971
None for me, Lily.
I've already had my ration today.

05:59.120 --> 06:00.406
The brownnoser.

06:01.120 --> 06:03.122
What a saint you are, Malcolm!

06:06.040 --> 06:07.087
This is ludicrous.

06:07.240 --> 06:10.528
Nora's right. How long are we to live
on three sips a day?

06:10.760 --> 06:12.649
It's that prison world all over again.

06:13.240 --> 06:15.402
- Beau is not complaining.
- Beau's mute.

06:17.920 --> 06:20.730
MALCOLM: And here we thought
we could have a family meal in peace.

06:20.920 --> 06:24.561
Beau, care to join me for a game
of backgammon, while the lovebirds bicker?

06:36.640 --> 06:39.007
RIC: I can't feel my cheeks.

06:40.240 --> 06:41.287
What are we drinking?

06:41.440 --> 06:43.249
No idea. Can you read German?

06:43.440 --> 06:45.841
- That's, uh, actually Dutch.
- Oh.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.642
- Wait, where are we?
- BONNIE: Amsterdam.

06:49.640 --> 06:54.771
"Dear Elena, yep, halfway across Europe
and they're still drunk."

06:54.960 --> 06:56.086
Is that really necessary?

06:56.280 --> 06:58.681
Elena told me to keep a journal
of everything she's missing.

06:58.920 --> 07:00.763
When she wakes up in sixty-some years

07:00.960 --> 07:03.281
and finds out that Ric died
from alcohol poisoning,

07:03.520 --> 07:05.363
she's gonna wanna know what happened.

07:05.600 --> 07:08.604
Unless you tragically choke to death
on those cocktail peanuts.

07:08.800 --> 07:10.325
Then I can tell her myself.

07:12.480 --> 07:14.289
You're so sweet.

07:15.640 --> 07:19.326
I'm gonna go rent a bike
and see the city like a normal tourist.

07:19.520 --> 07:21.966
- FYI, they don't wear helmets here.
- Keeps getting funnier.

07:22.160 --> 07:25.881
Hey. Ride in the tram tracks.
Don't look both ways.

07:26.200 --> 07:27.440
- Got it.
-(CHUCKLES)

07:31.160 --> 07:33.003
Are you sure you don't wanna go with her?

07:33.200 --> 07:34.645
Mmm. Nice try, I'm not leaving you.

07:35.440 --> 07:36.646
- I don't need a babysitter, Damon.
-(SIGHS)

07:36.840 --> 07:39.730
This isn't about what you need, Ric.
It's about what I need.

07:40.160 --> 07:41.810
'Cause keeping you
from jumping off a cliff

07:42.000 --> 07:45.971
keeps my mind off of the fact
that my girlfriend's magical coma

07:46.400 --> 07:50.246
is linked to a Bennett witch that has
a knack for avoiding permanent death.

07:50.480 --> 07:54.405
I see. So my misery is merely
a convenient distraction for you?

07:55.400 --> 07:56.731
- Yâ‚¬P-

08:00.520 --> 08:01.726
What?

08:03.200 --> 08:04.406
I'm glad you're here, buddy.

08:11.560 --> 08:14.166
I'm headed to New York this afternoon
to meet up with Lorenzo.

08:14.360 --> 08:15.691
I assume I have nothing to worry about.

08:15.880 --> 08:18.326
So you're allowed to explore the world
but we're stuck here,

08:18.560 --> 08:19.766
starving ourselves, pretending like

08:19.920 --> 08:21.331
we're not the strongest people
on the planet?

08:21.560 --> 08:23.050
Need I remind you how things used to be?

08:23.240 --> 08:26.608
You mean when you loved us
and allowed us to have actual fun?

08:26.840 --> 08:29.366
Our appetite for murder
drew unwanted attention.

08:29.560 --> 08:31.449
Forced us to run for decades at a time

08:31.600 --> 08:33.602
and then got us imprisoned for 100 years.

08:33.760 --> 08:36.445
Our way of living
did not work, Mary Louise.

08:36.600 --> 08:40.924
Now you want us to coexist.
We know. We've heard your speech.

08:41.120 --> 08:45.045
What about Oscar? He's been gone days,
running your errands.

08:45.240 --> 08:47.368
I highly doubt he's off living in secret.

08:51.600 --> 08:52.886
Valerie, you're a mess. What happened?

08:53.120 --> 08:55.805
Some horrible teenagers
plowed me down in their automobile.

08:56.040 --> 08:58.805
Oh, dear. ls their automobile okay?

08:59.920 --> 09:01.126
(LAUGHING)

09:01.640 --> 09:06.202
The little monsters left me for dead.
No apology. No call for help.

09:06.440 --> 09:10.809
I was roadkill. And what did I do?
I acted like roadkill.

09:11.200 --> 09:12.884
Because we're governed by a pacifist

09:13.080 --> 09:16.562
who'd rather see her children hurt
than stand up for themselves.

09:18.920 --> 09:23.881
Valerie, don't cry, okay?
You're home now. You're with us.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.286
Yeah.

09:28.080 --> 09:29.491
Who needs the rest of the world, right?

09:31.120 --> 09:32.326
We have each other.

09:36.160 --> 09:38.242
You resisted your urge to fight back.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.604
That means you're learning.

09:43.160 --> 09:45.128
I'm proud of you, Valerie.

10:03.120 --> 10:04.167
(GRUNTS)

10:04.320 --> 10:05.526
Missed a spot.

10:08.760 --> 10:09.807
Who are you?

10:10.000 --> 10:11.968
Remember that large squirrel
you ran over this morning?

10:12.160 --> 10:14.891
Turns out that was actually
our friend, Valerie.

10:16.960 --> 10:18.450
But you looked dead.

10:18.840 --> 10:20.046
I get that a lot.

10:22.680 --> 10:23.886
(CHANTING SPELL)

10:31.080 --> 10:32.764
You're worse than your friend.

10:32.960 --> 10:36.169
You thought about doing the right thing,
and then you just left her there.

10:39.440 --> 10:44.571
And yet, you're the first thing
in this town that I don't entirely hate.

10:44.880 --> 10:46.166
(SCREAMING)

10:51.680 --> 10:53.284
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

10:55.200 --> 10:56.645
Lily will be furious.

10:56.880 --> 10:59.884
Lily needs to learn that
Heretics aren't designed to coexist.

11:03.360 --> 11:05.089
Really? Be more vain.

11:05.280 --> 11:06.930
Well, if you were pretty, you'd be, too.

11:09.880 --> 11:11.120
(SIRENS WAILING IN DISTANCE)

11:14.880 --> 11:16.211
What the hell happened?

11:25.600 --> 11:28.365
Listen, these bodies,
they're not Lily's style.

11:28.560 --> 11:29.686
It's gotta be the Heretics.

11:29.880 --> 11:31.325
Reception went a little fuzzy, brother.

11:31.520 --> 11:34.410
It sounds like you said
Mom got her family of crazies back.

11:35.400 --> 11:36.481
Can I have some details?

11:36.680 --> 11:37.727
One victim had bite wounds.

11:37.960 --> 11:40.281
And the other one
was scorched beyond recognition.

11:40.880 --> 11:43.690
Matt found a house that's been in
foreclosure for the last two years.

11:43.880 --> 11:47.248
It had its power mysteriously turned
back on just days after Ric's wedding.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.608
So, Caroline is there staking it out.

11:50.080 --> 11:53.721
Listen, I need Ric
to tell me how to make a bomb.

11:54.120 --> 11:56.691
- Oh. For you.
- Hello.

11:56.880 --> 11:58.530
- Other side.
- Hello.

11:58.720 --> 12:01.166
STEFAN: Alaric, I need you to teach me
how to make a bomb.

12:01.400 --> 12:03.880
Okay, great. Well, the party's over.
Time to go home.

12:04.080 --> 12:09.120
I am literally staring at a treasure trove
full of your fancy little weapons.

12:09.320 --> 12:10.731
Yeah, exactly. Now, go use one.

12:10.920 --> 12:13.571
Well, it's not that easy.
I mean, if we want to take them out,

12:14.160 --> 12:15.730
we have to do it all at once.

12:16.120 --> 12:17.360
(SIGHS)

12:17.960 --> 12:20.964
All right, well, I'm gonna have to
call you back from a less populated place.

12:21.160 --> 12:22.400
And then I'm gonna blissfully pass out

12:22.600 --> 12:25.171
and pretend that this never happened.

12:29.200 --> 12:31.043
Oops! I'm okay.

12:31.560 --> 12:32.800
Lily won.

12:34.120 --> 12:37.647
As much as we did everything to stop her,
she actually got her family back.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.763
Stefan says he's got it. He's got it.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.928
Do you really believe that
or is that just some excuse

12:42.120 --> 12:43.724
to continue your slow crawl
towards rock bottom?

12:43.920 --> 12:46.730
Do you know how many days need to tick by
before I see Elena again?

12:46.920 --> 12:49.321
Twenty-two thousand
nine hundred and sixteen days.

12:49.520 --> 12:51.887
And that's assuming
you get some old person's disease.

12:52.640 --> 12:55.610
I haven't even begun
to approach rock bottom.

12:55.800 --> 12:58.690
Listen to yourself, Damon.
Elena wants you to live your life.

12:58.920 --> 13:00.206
Bon, if you're gonna be here,

13:00.400 --> 13:02.323
you don't get to play
the "what would Elena do" game.

13:03.120 --> 13:04.770
What is that supposed to mean?

13:05.680 --> 13:06.920
Nothing.

13:11.120 --> 13:15.045
Oh! I've had some janky-ass bourbon
in my time, but this is...

13:22.000 --> 13:23.650
It's not bourbon.

13:25.120 --> 13:26.406
It's tea.

13:30.520 --> 13:32.284
Have you ever seen this stone before?

13:33.680 --> 13:36.206
I can't say I have. What is it?

13:37.040 --> 13:38.565
That's not important.

13:40.600 --> 13:44.525
Can you commune with my wife
and tell her that I have it?

13:45.200 --> 13:49.649
I can try. Of course, I will need
a mystical tether to access her spirit.

13:50.880 --> 13:52.962
Something of significance.

13:58.040 --> 13:59.485
This is her wedding ring.

14:12.640 --> 14:14.722
I just had a very powerful feeling.

14:15.880 --> 14:18.486
There's a lot of energy in this ring.

14:19.080 --> 14:21.162
You two shared a strong bond.

14:22.160 --> 14:24.845
She loved you unconditionally.

14:25.680 --> 14:27.967
She wants you to know she misses--

14:28.160 --> 14:31.642
Do you get off on this?
Preying on the hope of miserable people?

14:32.400 --> 14:34.402
That ring is a fake, you dick.

14:36.560 --> 14:38.961
I lost the real one
to the first psychic I saw.

14:42.480 --> 14:44.084

please, darling.

Lorenzo, how I've missed you.

15:21.960 --> 15:23.200
Whose fault is that?

15:23.560 --> 15:27.326
Keeping me away while you toilet train
your new batch of orphaned puppies.

15:28.120 --> 15:30.771

so they can live under the radar.

15:32.760 --> 15:35.331
Yeah, bad influence.
Blah-blah-blah. Got it.

15:35.520 --> 15:38.490
Well, in the meantime,
you've summoned me to New York.

15:39.520 --> 15:40.646
My interest is piqued.

15:40.840 --> 15:43.889
I was hoping
you might find something for me.

15:44.080 --> 15:47.448
During my captivity,
a very dear possession I thought was lost

15:47.640 --> 15:50.405
when our ship from England was torched
was discovered by divers.

15:50.600 --> 15:52.602
It's been on display
at the city's maritime museum,

15:52.840 --> 15:54.649
but it's recently disappeared again.

15:54.840 --> 15:56.330
Why do you want it?

16:01.160 --> 16:03.970
If anyone discovered you were looking
for it, you might be in danger.

16:04.160 --> 16:06.288
Well, all the more reason
I should know why I'm looking for it.

16:06.520 --> 16:08.010
It's a family matter, Lorenzo.

16:13.680 --> 16:14.920
I thought I was your family.

16:15.160 --> 16:19.085
Darling, we want nothing more than
to believe you're on our side.

16:19.280 --> 16:23.001
Your side? I stood by you
when your own sons abandoned you.

16:23.200 --> 16:25.806
So, you're willing to see my sons
for the monsters they are?

16:27.600 --> 16:29.921
To turn your back on your friendships?

16:36.880 --> 16:39.611
What happened to that sick boy
I met on the boat?

16:39.800 --> 16:41.928
The boy abandoned at the workhouse
at the age of four?

16:42.120 --> 16:46.011
The boy who never knew kindness
until the day I saved his life?

16:49.160 --> 16:51.686

going to do this, now is our window.

29:00.000 --> 29:03.049
Well, I just saw it here,
and I thought I'd put it in safekeeping.

29:04.200 --> 29:06.168
Spare it from any future graffiti damage.

29:06.320 --> 29:10.166
Yeah, I was just about to do
the same thing. What's the catch?

29:10.840 --> 29:12.046
Come on, there's no catch.

29:12.240 --> 29:14.004
Just trying to cheer you up, Blondie.

29:14.680 --> 29:18.844
Not sure if you've noticed, but things are
getting a little glum around here.

29:19.040 --> 29:22.283
Oh, I'm sorry.
Have I not shown enough glee

29:22.520 --> 29:25.842
after uprooting an entire town
of innocent people because of you?

29:26.040 --> 29:27.565
- Me? Oh!
- Yeah.

29:28.200 --> 29:30.726
Don't clump me in
with Lily's circus freaks.

29:30.920 --> 29:32.570
Well, then where should I clump you?

29:32.760 --> 29:35.843
One day you're helping Lily,
the next you're here being nice.

29:36.520 --> 29:39.603
Just pick a side, Enzo. Us or them.

29:39.960 --> 29:41.883
God! You sound just like her.

29:42.680 --> 29:44.045
It's because she doesn't trust you.

29:45.240 --> 29:47.402
And honestly, neither do I.

(DOOR OPENS)

30:23.840 --> 30:25.410
Well, I'm back.

30:26.160 --> 30:27.969
Wanna tell me
who the hell's living in our house?

30:35.000 --> 30:36.240
The whole town
would have been slaughtered.

30:36.400 --> 30:37.925
So we kill them and call it a day.

30:38.080 --> 30:39.127
We already tried that.

30:39.280 --> 30:42.443
You sent Donovan
to blow up a house. Try harder.

30:42.960 --> 30:44.530
Look, the deal has been made.

30:44.760 --> 30:46.603
We don't mess with them.
They don't mess with us.

30:46.800 --> 30:48.848
That's very benevolent of you, brother.

30:49.080 --> 30:50.081
You should run for mayor.

30:50.280 --> 30:52.328
Not that anyone would be here
to vote for you.

30:52.520 --> 30:55.171
Look, what's done is done.
Do not mess this up.

30:58.040 --> 31:00.771
full of people
you don't give a crap about?

31:00.960 --> 31:02.371
'Cause it's not your idea,

31:02.600 --> 31:05.444
and Matt can't think his way out
of a paper bag, so it must be Caroline's.

31:06.040 --> 31:08.964
Do me a favor,
box that bottle up on your way out.

31:09.720 --> 31:12.530
Stefan hangs up his hero hair
for the girl.

31:14.120 --> 31:16.282
And here I thought my future was bleak.

31:19.040 --> 31:22.283
You know, Elena wanted you to be happy.
To live.

31:23.120 --> 31:25.327
Even encouraged you to date.

31:25.480 --> 31:28.962
But if she wakes up,
and everyone she loves is dead,

31:30.200 --> 31:31.964
do you think that she'd be able
to forgive that?

31:33.840 --> 31:36.684
I'm not doing this for Caroline, Damon.

31:38.640 --> 31:40.005
I'm doing this for you.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.411
OFFICER: Probably about an hour.

31:45.640 --> 31:47.847

31:54.920 --> 31:57.321
I honestly don't know where I am.

31:57.720 --> 32:00.929
Matt, surrendering the town
is not a solution.

32:01.160 --> 32:02.366
We need to stop them.

32:03.440 --> 32:06.091
They had been stopped, Bon. Back in 1903.

32:06.360 --> 32:09.045
But then you betrayed Kai,
he let them out,

32:09.280 --> 32:11.760
and I got to bury all my buddies
from the sheriff's department.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.411
So this is my fault?

32:14.840 --> 32:16.126
No.

32:16.880 --> 32:18.211
I didn't say that.

32:19.440 --> 32:21.408

33:41.080 --> 33:43.128
I have nowhere else to go.

So, I guess it's a good thing
I didn't get hit by a truck, huh?

33:48.280 --> 33:49.930
Come on, Bonnie, it was three seconds.

33:50.120 --> 33:53.806
Do you know how long three seconds are
in a life-or-death situation?

33:54.800 --> 33:56.609
In the first second, I thought how amazing

33:56.800 --> 33:58.404
it would feel to have Elena
in my arms again.

33:59.280 --> 34:01.282
By second number two, I kissed her.

34:02.000 --> 34:05.686
And by the third,
I remembered you're my best friend,

34:06.280 --> 34:09.601
and that if anything ever happened to you,
I would lose my mind.

34:09.800 --> 34:11.005
So, yes, Bonnie,

34:11.800 --> 34:13.688
I do know how long three seconds are.

34:17.080 --> 34:18.161
Just checking.

34:18.320 --> 34:19.844
And I will wait for her.

34:20.960 --> 34:22.291
And you're gonna help me.

34:24.280 --> 34:25.610
You're stuck with me, too.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.002
The Heretics are out because of me.

34:32.199 --> 34:35.487
No, Bonnie, the Heretics are out
because my mother's a lunatic

34:35.639 --> 34:37.165
and everyone's too scared to stop her.

34:37.360 --> 34:41.126
I'm not. I want to fight.
I want our town back.

to a bunch of supernatural terrorists?

35:55.240 --> 35:56.571
Yeah, probably.

35:56.720 --> 35:58.051
Stop.

35:58.680 --> 36:02.571
I'm a control freak,
giving up control. I'm delicate.

36:03.080 --> 36:05.048
Well, what would Sheriff Forbes do?

36:07.760 --> 36:11.242
She would protect human life at any cost.

36:12.600 --> 36:15.604
Well, then, no,
I don't think we're making a mistake.

36:25.800 --> 36:28.280
I thought I would heal
from my mom's death.

36:28.760 --> 36:33.641
I really thought that time would pass
and one day I would be ready to move on.

36:34.640 --> 36:36.165
But she's my mom,

36:36.600 --> 36:39.729
and I'm never gonna stop missing her.

36:42.640 --> 36:45.689
Well, that's life, Caroline.

I mean, you can't just sit back
and wait for the good parts to happen.

36:51.960 --> 36:55.282
But what you can do is
you can forgive yourself

36:56.480 --> 36:58.926
for trying to be happy
during the bad parts.

37:01.440 --> 37:03.966

last month.

Maybe not everything.

40:17.840 --> 40:21.970
What is it with everyone's incessant need
to write down every single feeling?

Okay, this whole stalker thing
is not even remotely charming.

you were right?

40:27.720 --> 40:30.246
Especially to tell me that I'm right.
Because I already knew that.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.401
So, word on the street is that

40:34.640 --> 40:37.246
one of Lily's magical elves
lost his heart.

40:37.480 --> 40:38.891
- What?
- You haven't heard?

40:39.960 --> 40:42.850
Yeah, someone killed Malcolm.
I believe he was her eldest.

40:43.520 --> 40:45.363
Well, who killed him?
Because we had a deal--

40:45.520 --> 40:47.887
Yeah, trust is a fickle thing.

40:48.040 --> 40:50.202
And it got me thinking
that if I want people to trust me,

40:50.360 --> 40:51.646
then I've got to earn it.

40:52.200 --> 40:54.043
That starts with choosing a side.

40:54.200 --> 40:56.521
So, here I am.

40:56.880 --> 40:58.405
Well, good for you. I need to call--

41:00.720 --> 41:02.722
I reckon it goes without saying,

41:04.040 --> 41:05.326
I chose Lily.

41:15.400 --> 41:17.880

until Elena was awake.
