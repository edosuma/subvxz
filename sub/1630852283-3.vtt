As a visiting head of state,

02:26.522 --> 02:28.649
I'd be honored if you gave a speech.

02:28.649 --> 02:31.735

02:55.968 --> 02:58.512
And once Rami sees
the wedding gift we brought,

02:58.512 --> 03:01.348
it could seal the alliance
between our two empires.

03:01.348 --> 03:03.267
With his blood lust and our money,

03:03.267 --> 03:05.143
