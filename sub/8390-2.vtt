IT WAS UNCONSCIONABLE.

05:33.950 --> 05:35.087

HELD CAPTIVE.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT A P.T. IS.

14:52.750 --> 14:54.672

A PHYSICAL THERAPIST.

14:54.720 --> 14:55.641
- THERE YOU GO.

14:55.680 --> 14:57.989
COLORED INDEX CARDS.
THEY'RE A LIFESAVER.

14:58.030 --> 14:59.406
- THERE IS SO MUCH
TO KEEP TRACK OF.

14:59.450 --> 15:01.759
- AH! OUR ENTIRE LIVES
ARE ON THESE CARDS.

15:01.790 --> 15:03.894
RED IS DIET.
YELLOW IS THERAPIES.

15:03.930 --> 15:05.989
GREEN IS MEDS.

IF WE DIDN'T HAVE A CARD
FOR IT,

15:10.870 --> 15:11.859
IT WOULD GO STRAIGHT
INTO THE CRAPPER

15:11.910 --> 15:13.138
WITH EVERYTHING
THAT'S GOING ON.

15:13.180 --> 15:14.283

YOU'RE GOING TO NEED
AN IN-HOUSE AIDE.

15:20.850 --> 15:22.329
I'VE NEVER--

15:22.360 --> 15:24.988
A GREAT BEHAVIORAL THERAPIST
WILL CHANGE MAX'S LIFE.

15:25.020 --> 15:27.159
- OH, THEY SAY DR. PELIKAN
IS THE BEST.

15:27.200 --> 15:29.259
A MIRACLE WORKER.

15:30.300 --> 15:31.881

AT CHANGING BEHAVIOR.

15:31.930 --> 15:33.124
THAT COULD BE GOOD.

15:33.170 --> 15:34.239
THAT COULD HELP MAX

15:34.270 --> 15:35.680
MAYBE GET OUT
OF HIS PIRATE COSTUME.

15:35.720 --> 15:36.926
- FORGET ABOUT PELIKAN.
- WHY?

15:36.970 --> 15:38.824
- BECAUSE NO ONE GETS IN
TO SEE PELIKAN.

15:38.860 --> 15:40.031
HE'S AN ELUSIVE ASS.

15:40.070 --> 15:42.038
HE'S LIKE THE BOB DYLAN
OF AUTISM.

15:42.070 --> 15:43.583
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
I WANT TO GIVE THIS A SHOT.

15:43.630 --> 15:46.519
I-I MAY HAVE SOME CONNECTIONS.
SO HOW DO YOU SPELL THAT?

15:46.560 --> 15:48.209
P-E-L?

STAY FOR DINNER.

15:52.910 --> 15:54.184

WE ALREADY MADE--

15:54.220 --> 15:55.289
WELL, WE DIDN'T MAKE IT.

YOU SHOULD GET USED TO IT.
- NO, NO, NO.

16:01.650 --> 16:03.197
- NONSENSE.
YOU'RE PART OF THE FAMILY NOW.

16:03.230 --> 16:04.470
WE'RE SO--

16:04.510 --> 16:06.262
- WELCOME.
- WELCOME TO THE FAMILY.

16:06.310 --> 16:08.926

[loud guitar strumming]

16:14.210 --> 16:16.678

OKAY. I SENT IT.

16:20.110 --> 16:21.554
CAN YOU BELIEVE
I GOT AN INTERVIEW?

16:21.600 --> 16:23.761

I GOT YOUR EMAIL.

16:23.810 --> 16:26.631
- OH. AND?

16:26.670 --> 16:27.739
- IT'S A LITTLE...

16:27.770 --> 16:29.214
- I THOUGHT--I THOUGHT
I WAS BEING HOT CORPORATE.

16:29.260 --> 16:31.421
WHAT--WHAT--
WHAT DO THEY WANT?

16:31.470 --> 16:34.155
- YOU NEED TO GO IN THERE
AND SAY "HERE I AM.

16:34.200 --> 16:35.770
I'M THE ONLY ONE
THAT COULD DO THIS JOB."

16:35.820 --> 16:36.741
- WELL, THAT'S A LIE.

16:36.780 --> 16:37.337
EVERYONE ELSE
COULD DO THIS JOB BUT ME.

16:37.370 --> 16:38.405
I'M NOT EVEN QUALIFIED.

16:38.440 --> 16:39.361
- WELL, THAT'S PROBABLY NOT
THE BEST ATTITUDE.

16:39.410 --> 16:42.334
YOU NEED TO SPIN A LITTLE.
- I CAN'T SPIN.

16:42.380 --> 16:44.951
I LOST MY SPIN.
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SPIN.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.206
- GREAT, THANKS.
- MAY I SPIN?

16:46.240 --> 16:47.377
- PLEASE.
- YOU'RE A GREAT ARTIST.

16:47.420 --> 16:49.376
YOU'VE BEEN UNAVAILABLE
FOR A WHILE SO YOU'RE A FIND.

16:49.420 --> 16:50.557
YOU'VE BEEN DOING
OTHER THINGS.

16:50.590 --> 16:52.000
- CHECKING MY EX-HUSBAND
INTO REHAB.

16:52.040 --> 16:53.348
- NOW YOU'RE BACK
IN THE EAST BAY

16:53.390 --> 16:54.721
AND YOU'RE READY TO PICK UP
WHERE YOU LEFT OFF.

16:54.770 --> 16:56.624
- TO MOVE IN WITH MY PARENTS
AT AN INAPPROPRIATE AGE.

16:56.670 --> 16:57.898
- YOU'RE NOT HELPING.

16:57.940 --> 17:00.215
- I JUST CAN'T SEE
REALLY GETTING THIS JOB.

17:00.260 --> 17:01.943
- THEY CALLED YOU,
DIDN'T THEY?

17:01.980 --> 17:03.356
- I KNOW.
THAT'S THE AMAZING THING.

17:03.400 --> 17:05.459
ALL I DID WAS SEND MY WORK,
AND THEY CALLED.

17:05.500 --> 17:07.639
- WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE
THEY SEE YOUR TALENT.

17:07.680 --> 17:08.601
THAT'S STEP ONE.

17:08.640 --> 17:10.437
STEP TWO IS YOU LOOK THIS GUY
IN THE EYE

17:10.470 --> 17:13.359
AND YOU SAY, "I AM GOING
TO BLOW YOUR FREAKIN' MIND."

17:13.410 --> 17:17.028
- [laughs] IT SOUNDS GOOD
WHEN YOU SAY IT.

17:17.070 --> 17:19.026
DID YOU GET THAT ONE?

17:19.070 --> 17:20.822
- I THINK
WE'RE IN THE WRONG STORE.

17:20.860 --> 17:24.899
- OH. CRAP.

17:24.940 --> 17:28.649
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

17:28.700 --> 17:30.452
OKAY, YOU DON'T LIKE IT.
I HAVE OTHERS.

17:30.490 --> 17:32.458
LET ME TRY THEM ON.
- NO, NO, NO. KATIE. KATIE.

17:32.490 --> 17:34.697
LISTEN, UM...

17:34.740 --> 17:37.664
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S GOING
TO WORK OUT THIS WEEKEND.

17:37.710 --> 17:39.223
- WHAT?
- I KNOW.

17:39.260 --> 17:42.366
- NO, WHAT? WHAT--WHAT--
WHAT COULD'VE COME UP?

17:42.400 --> 17:45.460
- WELL, IT'S KIND
OF A BIG DEAL.

17:45.510 --> 17:48.399
I-I DON'T KNOW IF I WANT TO GO
INTO IT RIGHT NOW.

17:48.440 --> 17:51.785
- CROSBY, IF YOU'RE BACK WITH
THAT BIMBO WAITRESS, BRANDI,

17:51.820 --> 17:54.641
OR THAT PSEUDO-ACTIVIST,
WAIFY ACTRESS PERSON--

17:54.690 --> 17:56.089
- OKAY, HONEY, HONEY,
I'M NOT BACK WITH ANYONE.

17:56.140 --> 17:58.062
- JUST TELL ME THE TRUTH.

18:00.700 --> 18:03.214
- OKAY.
[clears throat]

18:03.250 --> 18:07.937
OKAY.
[sighs]

18:07.980 --> 18:10.949
WE THINK MAX HAS ASPERGER'S.

18:10.980 --> 18:12.083
- WHAT?

18:12.120 --> 18:13.257
- ADAM AND KRISTINA

18:13.290 --> 18:14.359
ARE JUST FINDING OUT ABOUT IT.

18:14.400 --> 18:16.493
AND I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD
STICK AROUND THIS WEEKEND

18:16.540 --> 18:20.089
TO BE THERE FOR ADAM
AND KRISTINA.

18:20.130 --> 18:22.883
AND THE LITTLE GUY.

18:26.550 --> 18:31.203
- IT'S AMAZING TO HEAR YOU
TALK LIKE THAT.

18:31.240 --> 18:35.518
YOU'RE GONNA BE AN AMAZING
FATHER ONE DAY.

18:35.560 --> 18:38.381
AW, COME HERE.

18:38.420 --> 18:40.388
I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND
IF YOU NEED

18:40.420 --> 18:42.809
TO POSTPONE THE WEEKEND.

18:46.260 --> 18:48.490
- YOU KNOW, IT--
IT'S NOT IN STONE THOUGH.

18:48.540 --> 18:51.498
AND WE SHOULD PROBABLY
KEEP THAT OPTION OPEN.

18:51.540 --> 18:53.269
- [laughs]

18:53.300 --> 18:55.188
- DID YOU KNOW A COCKROACH
CAN HOLD ITS BREATH

18:55.230 --> 18:56.674
FOR 40 MINUTES?

18:56.720 --> 18:58.438
- FASCINATING.

18:58.480 --> 19:00.573
- ALL RIGHT, MAX, I WANT YOU
TO PUT CHARLIE AWAY.

19:00.620 --> 19:01.689
IT'S DINNER TIME.

19:01.720 --> 19:04.473
- COCKROACH CAN LIVE A MONTH
WITHOUT ITS HEAD.

19:04.520 --> 19:07.512
- OKAY, SERIOUSLY, I'M--
I DON'T HAVE AN APPETITE.

19:07.560 --> 19:09.448
- HADDIE, IT'S FINE.
IT'S NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL.

19:09.490 --> 19:14.143
- ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT,
MAX, PLEASE EAT YOUR FOOD.

19:14.180 --> 19:15.659
LEAVE THE COCKROACH ALONE.

19:15.700 --> 19:16.621
- I DON'T LIKE IT.

19:16.670 --> 19:17.523
- WELL, HOW DO YOU KNOW
YOU DON'T LIKE IT

19:17.570 --> 19:18.764
IF YOU'VE NEVER TRIED IT?

19:18.810 --> 19:19.595
- IT'S NOT ONE OF HIS FOODS.

19:19.640 --> 19:21.392
- HEY, MAX, SWEETHEART,
YOU KNOW,

19:21.430 --> 19:23.182
MAYBE YOU COULD EARN
SOME TV TIME TONIGHT

19:23.230 --> 19:24.367
BY TRYING YOUR FOOD.

19:24.400 --> 19:25.879
- I GET TV AFTER DINNER
ANYWAY.

19:25.920 --> 19:26.944
- IF YOU DON'T EAT
YOUR DINNER

19:26.990 --> 19:27.979
THEN YOU WON'T GET TV TIME.

19:28.020 --> 19:29.123
- IT'S NOT FAIR.

19:29.160 --> 19:30.843
THE RULES ARE I GET AN HOUR
OF TV TIME AFTER DINNER.

19:30.890 --> 19:32.050
- THE BOOK SAYS THAT WE SHOULD
FRAME THINGS FOR A REWARD,

19:32.100 --> 19:33.124
NOT PUNISHMENT.

19:33.170 --> 19:34.956
- WELL, HE'S SAYING
HE ALREADY GETS TV ANYWAY.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.025
- THAT IS MY TIME FOR THE TV.

19:37.070 --> 19:39.470
- MAYBE--MAYBE YOU GUYS
COULD GIVE HIM EXTRA TV TIME.

19:39.520 --> 19:41.135
- YEAH, HOW ABOUT THAT?
HOW ABOUT THAT, MAX?

19:41.180 --> 19:43.796
HOW ABOUT IF YOU TRY YOUR FOOD,
YOU'LL GET EXTRA TV TIME?

19:43.830 --> 19:44.694
- HOW MUCH?
- AN HOUR.

19:44.730 --> 19:46.072
- FIVE MINUTES.
- WHAT YOUR MOTHER SAID.

19:46.110 --> 19:47.486
FIVE MINUTES.
- FORGET IT.

19:47.530 --> 19:52.149
- PER BITE.
' 1! 2/ 3! 4/ 5/

19:52.190 --> 19:55.944
6, 7, 8,

19:55.980 --> 19:59.529
9, 10, 11, 12.

19:59.570 --> 20:01.606
THAT'S AN HOUR, RIGHT?
YOU SAID.

20:01.640 --> 20:05.531
- YEAH. WAIT, MAX,
YOU HAVE TO SIT DOWN

20:05.580 --> 20:07.195
UNTIL WE'RE FINISHED
WITH OUR MEAL.

20:07.240 --> 20:10.539
- WHY? I ALREADY EARNED
MY TV TIME.

20:10.580 --> 20:13.708
- THAT WORKED OUT WELL.
- SHUT UP, SWEETIE.

20:16.560 --> 20:18.175
I HAVE EMAILED
EVERYONE I KNOW

20:18.210 --> 20:21.520
LOOKING FOR A CONNECTION
WITH DR. PELIKAN.

20:21.560 --> 20:24.176
IT'S LIKE TRYING TO MEET
THE POPE.

20:24.220 --> 20:26.040
- THERE'S GOT TO BE
SOMEBODY ELSE.

20:26.080 --> 20:27.069
- I DON'T KNOW.

20:27.120 --> 20:29.873
[possum scampering]

20:29.910 --> 20:32.219
THAT ARROGANT SON OF A BITCH.

20:42.750 --> 20:45.822
[opossum chirping]

20:47.410 --> 20:49.719
[bushes rustling]

20:49.760 --> 20:54.038
[opossum chirping]

21:09.610 --> 21:11.635
- WHAT?
- I FOUND THIS IN THE BACK.

21:11.680 --> 21:16.128
- AND...?
- AND IS IT YOURS?

21:16.170 --> 21:17.398
- NO.
- YOU SURE?

21:17.440 --> 21:18.543
- HADDIE?
- NO!

21:18.580 --> 21:20.684
- I SWEAR TO GOD, IF YOU'RE
LYING TO US RIGHT NOW--

21:20.720 --> 21:21.857
- DON'T LIE.
- DO NOT LIE TO ME.

21:21.900 --> 21:24.107
YOU ARE DIGGING YOURSELF
A VERY, VERY, VERY DEEP HOLE.

21:24.140 --> 21:25.619
- BE THE WORST THING
YOU COULD DO.

21:25.660 --> 21:29.835
- YOU GUYS...
THIS IS NOT MINE.

21:30.970 --> 21:32.597
- NO?
- NO.

21:32.630 --> 21:34.598
- NO? 100%?
- YEAH.

21:34.630 --> 21:36.803
- POSITIVE.
- YEAH.

21:36.840 --> 21:38.569
- ALL RIGHT.
- OKAY.

21:38.600 --> 21:40.739
- BUT IT FEELS GOOD
THAT YOU TRUST YOUR DAUGHTER.

21:40.780 --> 21:42.941
- SORRY.
- YEAH.

21:45.640 --> 21:50.407
- WOW, YOU DID THIS IN 1990.
- YEAH.

21:50.440 --> 21:52.886
YOU WERE PROBABLY
IN GRADE SCHOOL.

21:52.930 --> 21:54.409
- PRESCHOOL, ACTUALLY.

21:54.450 --> 21:57.203
- OH, WOW.
THAT'S DEPRESSING.

21:57.240 --> 21:58.719
FOR ME. I MEAN, FOR ME.
NOT FOR YOU.

21:58.760 --> 22:00.864
FOR YOU, LOOK AT YOU.
THAT'S--YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

22:00.900 --> 22:04.654
- UH, SO WHAT HAVE YOU
BEEN DOING ALL THESE YEARS?

22:04.700 --> 22:05.962
- WELL, I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
ASK THAT.

22:06.010 --> 22:09.218
UM, I'VE JUST...

22:09.250 --> 22:10.831
BEEN FOCUSING ON MY FAMILY,
I GUESS.

22:10.880 --> 22:13.496
I HAVE TWO KIDS.
- UM, YEAH, THAT'S WONDERFUL.

22:13.530 --> 22:16.294
- NOT IF YOU KNOW THEM.
I'M KIDDING. THEY'RE GREAT.

22:17.710 --> 22:19.678
NO, WHAT I MEANT TO SAY
IS THAT IT'S AN HONORABLE CHOICE

22:19.710 --> 22:21.507
TO CHOOSE YOUR FAMILY
OVER CAREER.

22:21.540 --> 22:23.986
- YEAH.
I JUST MOVED TO BERKELEY.

22:24.030 --> 22:26.169
AND THIS MIGHT SOUND LAME,

22:26.200 --> 22:28.782
BUT I'M READY TO MAKE
A FRESH START.

22:28.830 --> 22:32.823
AND IF YOU GIVE ME
THIS CHANCE,

22:32.860 --> 22:36.341
I KNOW I CAN BLOW
YOUR FREAKIN' MIND.

22:36.380 --> 22:38.007
UGH. MY SISTER TOLD ME
TO SAY THAT.

22:38.040 --> 22:40.008
THAT SOUNDED SO STUPID.
I'M REALLY SORRY.

22:40.040 --> 22:42.281
- THAT'S OKAY. THAT'S OKAY.
NOW, UH, TELL ME ABOUT THIS.

22:42.320 --> 22:43.309
WHAT AM I LOOKING AT HERE?

22:43.360 --> 22:46.705
- OKAY, SO, UM, MY EX-HUSBAND
WAS IN A BAND.

22:46.740 --> 22:47.832
AND, UH,
IT WAS PRETTY SUCCESSFUL.

22:47.880 --> 22:50.189
AND I STARTED DOING
ALL THEIR, UM,

22:50.230 --> 22:51.674
THEIR POSTERS AND STUFF.

22:51.710 --> 22:53.917
AND THEN I WORKED
FOR ANOTHER BAND.

22:53.950 --> 22:57.260
AND WORD GOT OUT
TO SOME RESTAURANTS SO...

22:57.300 --> 22:59.928
- RIGHT. UH, WELL, I GOT TO BE
HONEST WITH YOU, SARAH,

22:59.960 --> 23:03.168
YOUR WORK IS PHENOMENAL.

23:03.200 --> 23:05.065
WOW.
- REALLY?

23:05.100 --> 23:06.271
- I LOVE THESE.

23:06.310 --> 23:07.959
IT--IT--IT'S HIP
WITHOUT TRYING TO BE HIP.

23:08.000 --> 23:08.967
IT'S FRESH, FUN.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.513
NOW, YOU SAW THE RANGE

23:10.560 --> 23:12.619
THAT WE'RE TALKING
FOR STARTING SALARY.

23:12.660 --> 23:15.106
- THE MONEY? YEAH.
THAT WOULD BE FINE.

23:15.150 --> 23:19.143
- GOOD. GOOD.
UM, YOU'LL BE REPORTING TO ME.

23:19.190 --> 23:20.498
IS THAT GONNA BE A PROBLEM?

23:20.530 --> 23:23.283
JUST IN TERMS OF THE, UH...

23:23.330 --> 23:25.423
- 'CAUSE I'M SO OLD?

23:25.470 --> 23:27.700
- NO, THAT I'M SO OLD.
- OH. NO, THAT'S--

23:27.750 --> 23:28.819
- NO, NO, THAT'S FINE.

23:28.850 --> 23:31.910
I CAN TAKE A NOTE
FROM A WHIPPERSNAPPER LIKE YOU.

23:31.960 --> 23:34.815
UGH. I, UH, NO,
IT WOULDN'T BE ANY PROBLEM.

23:34.860 --> 23:39.684
- OKAY. GOOD. ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S GOOD.

24:01.570 --> 24:04.016

- WHAT?
- SHE'S ON HER WAY.

24:07.480 --> 24:09.095
SHE'S IN A CAR
WITH RACQUEL AND HARMONY.

24:09.130 --> 24:10.927
- RACQUEL? WHY?

24:10.960 --> 24:13.440
- MANDARIN CLASS RAN OVER,
AND THEY NEEDED SOMEBODY

24:13.480 --> 24:14.993
TO CLAIM A TABLE.

24:15.030 --> 24:17.100
IT'S GONNA BE
A PRETTY BIG GROUP.

24:17.140 --> 24:20.268
- OH.
- YES?

24:20.320 --> 24:22.527
- I MOVED MY MEETING
AND JOCKEYED THROUGH TRAFFIC

24:22.560 --> 24:24.937
TO HAVE 21 MINUTES
WITH MY DAUGHTER,

24:24.980 --> 24:28.939
AND SHE'S IN THE CAR
WITH RACQUEL.

24:28.980 --> 24:31.596
- I'LL TEXT HER.
- NO. SHE'S AN INSANE DRIVER.

24:31.640 --> 24:33.733
DON'T TEXT HER.
- OH, JULIA.

24:33.780 --> 24:35.941
- SHE IS.
- OH, GOD, JULES.

24:35.990 --> 24:38.629
I KNOW YOU THINK RACQUEL
IS INTENSE.

24:38.680 --> 24:40.910
AND SHE IS.
BUT SHE'S--SHE'S A GREAT MOM.

24:40.960 --> 24:43.611
- GOOD.
THAT'S GREAT TO HEAR.

24:43.650 --> 24:45.402
- CONSIDERING.
- MOMMY!

24:45.440 --> 24:48.580
- HI, SYD!
OKAY, I HAVE 18 MINUTES.

24:48.620 --> 24:50.167
I'M SPENDING THEM
WITH MY DAUGHTER.

24:50.210 --> 24:51.689
- OKAY.

24:51.730 --> 24:52.799
- HI.
- HEY. HEY, GUYS.

24:52.830 --> 24:54.934

THE MOST AMAZING CLASS.

24:54.970 --> 24:56.892
- YEAH?

24:56.940 --> 25:00.216
- SO YOU DROVE
ALL THE WAY FROM DOWNTOWN

25:00.250 --> 25:01.285
TO ASK ME THIS?

25:01.320 --> 25:03.697
- COULD YOU JUST ANSWER ME?

25:03.740 --> 25:05.947
- NO, IT'S NOT MY POT.
- ARE YOU SURE?

25:05.980 --> 25:07.083
- YEAH, WELL, HEY,
YOU KNOW,

25:07.120 --> 25:08.872
I HAVEN'T SMOKED THAT STUFF
IN YEARS.

25:08.920 --> 25:09.944
AND, UH, WHAT THE HELL
WERE YOU DOING

25:09.990 --> 25:11.844
OUT IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT WEED WHACKING?

25:13.020 --> 25:16.433
IT'S A POSSUM, RAT, RACCOON.
I DON'T KNOW. SOMETHING.

25:16.480 --> 25:19.745
- CALL AN EXTERMINATOR.
- IT'S PERSONAL.

25:19.790 --> 25:20.950
- PERSONAL?
- YEAH.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.399
EVERY NIGHT,
HE'S UP ON THE ROOF

25:22.450 --> 25:23.758
MAKING NOISE RIGHT ABOVE US.

25:23.790 --> 25:25.417
AND JUST FEELS LIKE IT'S
DELIBERATE.

25:25.450 --> 25:28.032
LIKE HE'S...
MOCKING ME.

25:28.070 --> 25:29.105
SO ANYWAY, I GOT TO GET RID
OF IT.

25:29.140 --> 25:30.243
I GOT TO GET IT OUT
OF THE HOUSE. THAT'S ALL.

25:30.280 --> 25:32.862
- WELL, SONNY, YOU KNOW,
IT COULD BE SOMETHING ELSE.

25:34.420 --> 25:36.308
- LIKE WHAT, A WEASEL?
- WEASEL?

25:36.360 --> 25:37.804
NO, PSYCHOLOGICAL.
COULD BE...

25:37.840 --> 25:40.047
- IT'S NOT PSYCHOLOGICAL.
- SOMETHING YOU'RE MANIFESTING.

25:40.090 --> 25:41.739
- I'M NOT MANIFESTING ANYTHING,
OKAY?

25:41.780 --> 25:44.226
- WELL, YOU'RE CERTAINLY KIND
OF RESISTANT TO THE IDEA...

25:44.260 --> 25:45.875
- HEY.
- HEY, ADAM, PERFECT.

25:45.920 --> 25:47.399
MOM JUST MADE CARROT CAKE.

25:47.440 --> 25:50.329

- POP, CARROT CAKE?

25:51.790 --> 25:53.439

MAYBE IN A LITTLE BIT.

25:53.480 --> 25:54.572
GOT A LITTLE MORE WORK
TO DO.

25:54.620 --> 25:55.996
WOULDN'T WANT TO HELP,
WOULD YOU?

25:56.030 --> 25:57.440
- OKAY. YEAH. EARN IT.

25:57.480 --> 25:58.788
- YEAH, MAKE SURE YOU EARN IT.
- YEAH.

25:58.830 --> 26:00.969
- DID YOU DITCH A BAG OF WEED
IN MY YARD?

26:01.000 --> 26:04.310
- ARE YOU CRAZY?
- JUST ASKING A QUESTION.

26:04.350 --> 26:06.580
- HMM. BY THE WAY,

26:06.630 --> 26:08.723
I NEED YOU TO COVER FOR ME

26:08.770 --> 26:10.214
I TOLD HER MAX HAS ASPERGER'S

26:10.250 --> 26:12.901
AND THAT'S WHY I CAN'T GO AWAY
WITH HER THIS WEEKEND.

26:12.950 --> 26:14.941
- YOU USED MAX'S ASPERGER'S
AS AN EXCUSE.

26:14.980 --> 26:16.356
- YEAH, I'M DOUBLE-BOOKED.

26:16.400 --> 26:18.322
I'M SUPPOSED TO GO WITH KATIE
TO THIS INCREDIBLE SPA

26:18.360 --> 26:19.839
IN NAPA
AND THEN JASMINE ASKS ME

26:19.880 --> 26:21.120
IF I CAN BOND WITH JABBAR.

26:21.160 --> 26:22.570
- SO YOU'RE DECIDING
WHETHER OR NOT

26:22.610 --> 26:23.986
TO GO TO SOME SPA
WITH KATIE

26:24.030 --> 26:25.577
OR SPEND TIME
WITH YOUR SON

26:25.610 --> 26:26.747
THAT YOU'VE MET TWICE
IN YOUR LIFE.

26:26.790 --> 26:28.781
- IF YOU SAW THE LINGERIE
SHE BOUGHT FOR THIS TRIP,

26:28.820 --> 26:30.026
YOU'D UNDERSTAND THE DILEMMA.

26:30.070 --> 26:31.856
- HEY, JACKASS,
YOU HAVE A SON, OKAY?

26:31.900 --> 26:34.653
YOU NEED TO MAN UP, TAKE CARE
OF YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES.

26:34.690 --> 26:36.339
- MM. YOU COMFORTABLE
UP THERE ON YOUR HIGH HORSE

26:36.380 --> 26:37.688
LOOKING DOWN ON ME?

26:37.730 --> 26:41.143
MY LIFE'S COMPLICATED,
ADAM.

26:41.180 --> 26:42.624
MM. LISTEN, BY THE WAY,

26:42.670 --> 26:43.932
THAT GUY
THAT YOU EMAILED ME ABOUT--

26:43.980 --> 26:47.632
DR. PELIKAN--
I GOT AN IN.

26:47.670 --> 26:48.705
- YOU?
- YEAH, ME.

26:48.740 --> 26:50.662
I HAVE AN IN.
CAN YOU IMAGINE?

26:50.710 --> 26:55.124
KATIE'S MOM DID HIM
AT SOME NEW AGE RETREAT

26:55.160 --> 26:56.058
BACK IN THE '705.

26:56.090 --> 26:57.648
- SLOW DOWN. WHAT?

26:57.680 --> 27:01.719
- KATIE'S MOM DID HIM
AT ESALIN IN 1973, OKAY?

27:01.750 --> 27:03.024
- AND THIS HELPS ME HOW?

27:03.060 --> 27:05.267
- HE HAS A CANCELLATION
THIS AFTERNOON.

27:05.310 --> 27:06.686
- HE HAS A CANCELLATION TODAY?

27:06.720 --> 27:08.347
WHY DID YOU WAIT SO LONG
TO TELL ME ABOUT THIS?

27:08.380 --> 27:11.201
- WELL, SORRY THAT I WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU FOR FIVE SECONDS

27:11.250 --> 27:12.103
ABOUT MY LIFE.

27:12.140 --> 27:13.209
- I GOT TO GO, OKAY?

27:13.250 --> 27:14.899
THIS GUY'S IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE.
THANK YOU.

27:14.940 --> 27:17.079
- OH, GREAT.
THANKS FOR YOUR TIME.

27:17.110 --> 27:18.418
THAT'S REALLY GENEROUS
OF YOU.

27:18.460 --> 27:19.973
- I DON'T WANT TO GO.

27:20.010 --> 27:22.114
- LOOK, MAX, WE'RE JUMPING OVER
AN 18-MONTH WAITING LIST HERE.

27:22.150 --> 27:23.139
OKAY, WE HAVE TO GO.

27:23.190 --> 27:25.044
- HONEY, HE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT A WAITING LIST IS.

27:25.090 --> 27:26.284
- THIS GUY IS THE BOB DYLAN
OF ASPERGER'S.

27:26.330 --> 27:28.150
- BOB DYLAN NEVER HAD
A NUMBER ONE RECORD.

27:28.190 --> 27:29.361
- HE'S A GENIUS.

27:29.400 --> 27:31.265
- THEN HOW COME HE NEVER HAD
A NUMBER ONE HIT RECORD

27:31.300 --> 27:32.267
ON BILLBOARD?

27:32.300 --> 27:33.915
THE BEATLES HAD 20 NUMBER ONE
HIT RECORDS.

27:33.960 --> 27:35.928
- UH-HUH.
- MICHAEL JACKSON HAD 13.

27:35.960 --> 27:37.439
THE BEE GEES HAD NINE.

27:37.480 --> 27:39.789
- WELL, MAYBE TRY NOT TO COMPARE
BOB DYLAN TO THE BEE GEES.

27:39.830 --> 27:41.513
AND WE HAVE TO GO.

27:41.550 --> 27:43.415
- HEY, TURN THE TV BACK ON.
- WE HAVE TO GO, MAX.

27:43.450 --> 27:44.610
COME ON.
- NO WAY.

27:44.660 --> 27:45.934
- OKAY, RIGHT NOW,
WE HAVE TO DO THIS.

27:45.970 --> 27:47.722
- NO!
- MAX, PUT YOUR SHOES ON.

27:47.760 --> 27:49.204
- MAX. HEY. MAX!

27:49.250 --> 27:50.626
THIS GUY CAN'T HELP YOU
UNLESS WE GO.

27:50.660 --> 27:52.070
- NOT THAT YOU NEED HELP.
- WE NEED TO GO.

27:52.110 --> 27:53.099
YES, HE DOES.

27:53.150 --> 27:54.492
- ADAM, I DON'T WANT HIM
TO THINK THAT HE NEEDS--

27:54.530 --> 27:56.350
- KRISTINA, WE NEED TO MAKE
THIS APPOINTMENT, OKAY?

27:56.390 --> 27:58.597
[all arguing]
- HEY.

27:58.640 --> 28:02.019
- WHAT? WHAT?
- UM...

28:02.050 --> 28:05.326
IT WAS MINE.
THE POT. IT WAS MINE.

28:05.370 --> 28:08.157
UM...I JUST COULDN'T SLEEP
LAST NIGHT.

28:08.200 --> 28:10.088
AND I FELT LIKE I HAD
TO TELL YOU.

28:10.130 --> 28:13.019
SO A COUPLE OF FRIENDS
AND I CHIPPED IN.

28:13.070 --> 28:15.209
DO NOT ASK ME WHO
'CAUSE I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU.

28:15.240 --> 28:20.416
BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS STUPID
AND I'M NOT GONNA DO IT AGAIN.

28:21.350 --> 28:22.829
OKAY?

28:27.870 --> 28:31.385
SORRY FOR NOT BEING THE GIRL
THAT YOU THOUGHT I WAS.

28:33.220 --> 28:35.040
OKAY.

28:38.780 --> 28:43.149
[cell phone ringing]

28:43.200 --> 28:45.088
- HELLO.
- SARAH, HI. IT'S EDWIN CHUNG.

28:45.130 --> 28:47.018
HOW ARE YOU?
- OH, HI. I'M GOOD.

28:47.070 --> 28:49.209
HOW ARE YOU?
- GOOD. DO YOU HAVE A SECOND?

28:49.240 --> 28:51.891
- YEAH. SURE.
THAT WAS REALLY FUN TODAY.

28:51.930 --> 28:53.898
- LISTEN, I AM SO SORRY,
UNFORTUNATELY,

28:53.930 --> 28:56.171
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK OUT.

28:58.150 --> 29:00.004
- OH.
- YEAH. I THINK YOU'RE GREAT.

29:00.040 --> 29:01.314
I DO. AND I WAS FIGHTING
FOR YOU.

29:01.360 --> 29:03.385
BUT MY BOSSES JUST WON'T
HIRE ANYONE

29:03.430 --> 29:04.385
WITHOUT A COLLEGE DEGREE.

29:04.430 --> 29:07.081
IN ANY CASE,
I WANTED TO CALL YOU PERSONALLY

29:07.120 --> 29:08.769
TO LET YOU KNOW
HOW SORRY I AM.

29:08.810 --> 29:10.459
- RIGHT. SURE.

29:10.500 --> 29:11.979
- OH. AND MY BOSSES
WANTED ME

29:12.020 --> 29:13.089
TO MAKE SURE TO THANK
YOUR BROTHER,

29:13.130 --> 29:15.269
ADAM BRAVERMAN
AT T&S FOOTWEAR.

29:15.300 --> 29:18.292
- YEAH, BUT--BUT WHY DO--
DO--DO YOU KNOW HIM?

29:18.340 --> 29:19.887
- YEAH. THAT'S WHY
YOU WERE BROUGHT IN.

29:19.930 --> 29:22.615
I THOUGHT YOU KNEW.
- YEAH. YEAH.

29:22.650 --> 29:24.060
OH, YEAH. RIGHT.
OF COURSE.

29:24.100 --> 29:25.374
NO, NO. I--THAT'S--
THAT'S RIGHT.

29:25.410 --> 29:27.298
I FORGOT. I WILL.
I'LL DEFINITELY SAY HI TO HIM.

29:27.350 --> 29:30.899
THANKS. OKAY.
THANKS SO MUCH. BYE-BYE.

29:33.730 --> 29:35.869
HOW WAS SCHOOL?
- CAN WE JUST GO, PLEASE?

29:35.910 --> 29:37.593
- OH, GOD, CAN YOU JUST
NOT GIVE ME THIS ATTITUDE?

29:37.630 --> 29:38.494
NOT TODAY.

29:38.530 --> 29:39.872
- CAN YOU JUST DRIVE THE CAR,
PLEASE?

29:39.910 --> 29:40.763
- YES.
I CAN DRIVE THE CAR.

29:40.810 --> 29:42.186
I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU
AND REMIND YOU--

29:42.220 --> 29:43.426
- CAN WE PLEASE
NOT DO THIS HERE?

29:43.470 --> 29:45.188
- THAT THIS IS NOT A PUNISHMENT.
ALL YOU DO IS BE NEGATIVE.

29:45.230 --> 29:46.674
- PLEASE RESPECT MY OPINION.
- AND COMPLAIN.

29:46.710 --> 29:48.439
- I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS.
- AND GET YOUR COUSIN ARRESTED.

29:48.470 --> 29:50.529
- OH. OKAY. YEAH.
AND THAT WAS MY FAULT.

29:50.580 --> 29:51.808
- OKAY.
- IT WASN'T. I'M SERIOUS.

29:51.850 --> 29:54.501
LISTEN TO ME, PLEASE!
I DIDN'T SMOKE POT.

29:54.550 --> 29:55.858
AND I DIDN'T GIVE ANY TO HER.

29:55.890 --> 29:57.096
AND I DIDN'T ENCOURAGE HER
TO SMOKE IT.

29:57.140 --> 30:00.348
BUT YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME.
EVER. YOU DIDN'T EVEN LISTEN.

30:00.380 --> 30:01.233
AND AS FOR THIS SCHOOL,

30:01.280 --> 30:02.588
I'M REALLY GLAD
THAT YOU SENT ME HERE

30:02.620 --> 30:04.133
BECAUSE THEY'RE
HOLDING ME BACK.

30:04.180 --> 30:05.442
- WHAT?
- YEAH, I GOT HELD BACK.

30:05.490 --> 30:07.105
I'M GONNA HAVE TO DO
TENTH GRADE ALL OVER AGAIN.

30:07.150 --> 30:09.175
SO THANKS A LOT
FOR MAKING ME GO HERE.

30:09.220 --> 30:10.528
- WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

30:10.560 --> 30:12.175
- THEY'RE MAKING ME DO
TENTH GRADE OVER AGAIN

30:12.220 --> 30:14.142
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T LIKE
MY TRANSCRIPTS FROM FRESNO.

30:14.190 --> 30:15.282
- WHO IS?
- I DON'T KNOW.

30:15.330 --> 30:16.979
I DON'T KNOW, I JUST--
- WHO SAID THAT?

30:17.020 --> 30:21.013
- I'M TAKING THE BUS.
- AMBER, COME ON.

30:25.270 --> 30:29.639
- WE'RE OUT OF HERE. HA HA HA.
- WHOOP.

30:29.680 --> 30:31.159
- WELL, MAX DID JUST GREAT.

30:31.200 --> 30:32.474
MAX, HOW ABOUT
YOU HANG OUT HERE,

30:32.520 --> 30:33.748
PLAY A LITTLE WITH THE TOYS.

30:33.790 --> 30:35.348
AND YOUR MOM AND DAD
AND I WILL GO TALK

30:35.380 --> 30:36.369
FOR A FEW MINUTES.

30:36.420 --> 30:39.378
- OKAY.
- KISSES. OKAY?

30:46.910 --> 30:50.016
- WELL?
- WELL, MAX...

30:50.050 --> 30:51.039
IS A WONDERFUL BOY.

30:51.090 --> 30:54.253
HE'S SMART. HE'S SWEET.
HE IS VERY INTELLIGENT.

30:54.300 --> 30:55.983
- OKAY, DOCTOR,
I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

30:56.020 --> 30:57.635
I DON'T WANT TO BE RUDE,
BUT WE JUST WANT TO KNOW.

30:57.680 --> 31:01.127
I MEAN, DOES--DO YOU THINK
MAX HAS ASPERGER'S?

31:01.160 --> 31:02.297
- MAX IS
VERY HIGH FUNCTIONING.

31:02.340 --> 31:05.161
BUT I DO FIND
THAT MAX'S BEHAVIORS

31:05.200 --> 31:10.092
ARE CONSISTENT
WITH AN ASPERGER'S DIAGNOSIS.

31:14.800 --> 31:16.791
- OH, MY GOD.
- ALL RIGHT.

31:16.840 --> 31:18.341
UH, THIS IS FINE.

31:18.390 --> 31:20.620
WE'RE GONNA--
LOOK, WE CAN WORK THROUGH THIS.

31:20.670 --> 31:22.149
IT'S NOT AN INSURMOUNTABLE
PROBLEM.

31:22.190 --> 31:23.259
- NO.

31:23.290 --> 31:24.837
- I THINK WE SHOULD
JUST TACKLE THIS ONE-BY-ONE.

31:24.880 --> 31:26.108
SO PIRATE COSTUME.

31:26.160 --> 31:27.843
I THINK GETTING HIM OUT
OF THAT THING IS KEY.

31:27.880 --> 31:29.848
- WELL, I'M--I'M HAPPY TO HELP
WITH STRATEGIES

31:29.880 --> 31:31.507
FOR SPECIFIC BEHAVIORS.

31:31.540 --> 31:32.507
I THINK THAT WE SHOULD START

31:32.540 --> 31:34.394
WITH MORE OF
A BIG PICTURE CONVERSATION.

31:34.440 --> 31:36.328
- I'M JUST--I'M BETTER
WITH PRACTICAL STUFF.

31:36.370 --> 31:38.258
SO YOU KNOW, I JUST WANT TO--
WE GOT TO GET MOVING ON THIS.

31:38.310 --> 31:39.095
- ADAM, CAN YOU JUST--
- WHAT?

31:39.130 --> 31:41.098
- CAN YOU PLEASE
JUST LET HIM TALK?

31:41.140 --> 31:43.517
HE'S SORRY.
- NO. GO FOR IT.

31:43.550 --> 31:46.963
- THANKS.
- OKAY.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.309
THIS ISN'T A PRISON SENTENCE.
- I KNOW.

31:49.350 --> 31:50.829
- SO HOW LONG IS THIS
GOING TO TAKE THEN?

31:50.870 --> 31:53.213
- HOW LONG WILL WHAT TAKE?
- JUST TO GET HIM THROUGH THIS.

31:53.250 --> 31:54.626
GET HIM BACK ON TRACK.

31:54.670 --> 31:57.070
- OKAY, UNFORTUNATELY,
THERE IS NO CURE FOR ASPERGER'S.

31:57.120 --> 32:00.738
IT IS A SYNDROME THAT
HE WILL ALWAYS HAVE. OKAY?

32:00.780 --> 32:02.498
- I-I DON'T--
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

32:02.540 --> 32:04.940
- SORRY. WHAT--WHAT ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO DO FOR HIM?

32:04.990 --> 32:06.127
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW--

32:06.160 --> 32:09.846
- YOU WILL HELP TO UNCOVER
MAX'S GIFTS.

32:09.890 --> 32:12.290
YOU FIGURE OUT
HOW HE LEARNS.

32:12.340 --> 32:15.195
YOU GET AS MUCH SUPPORT
FOR MAX AS POSSIBLE.

32:15.240 --> 32:16.992
QUITE HONESTLY,
THE RESEARCH CLEARLY SHOWS

32:17.030 --> 32:18.611
THE GREATEST BAROMETER
OF SUCCESS

32:18.660 --> 32:22.448
FOR CHILDREN WITH ASPERGER'S
IS THEIR PARENTS' INVOLVEMENT.

32:22.490 --> 32:24.071
- OH, OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

32:24.110 --> 32:27.728
SO JUST--JUST IN CASE
WE CAN NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,

32:27.770 --> 32:29.078
HOW--WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST

32:29.110 --> 32:30.452
WE DO TO GET HIM OUT
OF THE PIRATE COSTUME?

32:30.500 --> 32:33.560
- SO THE FIRST STEP
IS NOT TO--TO WRENCH MAX OUT

32:33.600 --> 32:35.397
OF HIS COMFORT ZONE.

32:35.430 --> 32:39.799
OKAY, THE FIRST STEP
IS TO JOIN MAX WHERE HE IS.

32:39.850 --> 32:44.605
AND THEN WHEN HE'S READY,
YOU WALK HIM INTO THE WORLD.

32:56.760 --> 32:59.627
- AND NOW FOR THE MAIN
EVENT OF OUR EVENING,

32:59.660 --> 33:02.288
I GIVE YOU OVER
TO MY INCREDIBLE CO-CHAIR.

33:02.320 --> 33:03.548
DOES HE CLEAN UP WELL
OR WHAT?

33:03.600 --> 33:05.249
[cheers and applause]
- AW, SO HANDSOME.

33:05.290 --> 33:08.521
- NOT ONLY DID JOEL ORGANIZE
MOST OF THIS EVENT HIMSELF,

33:08.570 --> 33:11.323
BUT HE LITERALLY BUILT
THE PLATFORM

33:11.360 --> 33:13.055
THAT WE ARE STANDING ON
RIGHT NOW

33:13.090 --> 33:15.251
WITH HIS OWN TWO, BIG,
MAN HANDS.

33:15.300 --> 33:17.951
[cheers and applause]

33:17.990 --> 33:20.572

- RACQUEL.

33:20.610 --> 33:22.339
- OH.

33:22.370 --> 33:24.998
- NO. WHAT?

33:25.030 --> 33:26.474
SHE IS ACTUALLY,
UH, RESPONSIBLE

33:26.520 --> 33:28.829
FOR DOING VIRTUALLY
ALMOST EVERYTHING

33:28.860 --> 33:30.373
IN GETTING TONIGHT'S EVENT
TOGETHER.

33:30.420 --> 33:32.206
SO LET'S HEAR IT FOR RACQUEL.
- AW.

33:32.250 --> 33:33.444
[cheers and applause]

COLLAPSES,

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

NOT KIDDING.

33:41.500 --> 33:43.081
OKAY, UM,
WE ARE GOING TO START

33:43.120 --> 33:46.157
WITH THE BIGGEST AUCTION ITEM
OF THE NIGHT.

33:46.190 --> 33:48.397
THE HIGHEST BIDDER
WILL GO HOME

33:48.440 --> 33:52.604
WITH A PREMIUM PARKING SPOT
AT SYCAMORE

33:52.650 --> 33:53.639

33:53.680 --> 33:56.433
- AH, SWEET. THAT'S MINE.
YES, IT IS.

33:56.480 --> 33:57.856

35:13.620 --> 35:15.485

WITH HER?

35:15.520 --> 35:17.454
- [over microphone]
I KNOW, SHE DOESN'T EVEN WORK.

35:17.490 --> 35:21.483
- SHE DOESN'T WORK?
[feedback]

35:24.290 --> 35:27.908
- WHICH IS A VALID--

35:27.950 --> 35:30.601
SUCH A VALID,
WONDERFUL CHOICE

35:30.640 --> 35:36.408
THAT, YOU KNOW,
I DID AN EXTRA MONTH

35:36.440 --> 35:37.509
OF MATERNITY LEAVE.

35:37.540 --> 35:39.235
I-I TOOK THAT--
- EXCELLENT.

35:39.270 --> 35:42.478
$1,500.
GOING ONCE. GOING TWICE.

35:42.510 --> 35:44.580
- LET'S MAKE IT $1,920
IN HONOR OF THE YEAR

35:44.620 --> 35:46.030
WOMEN WON THE RIGHT
TO VOTE.

35:46.070 --> 35:47.549
SOLI DARITY.

35:47.590 --> 35:50.718
- SOLD. GREAT, LADIES.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

35:50.760 --> 35:53.320
THAT'S A GREAT WAY TO START OFF
THE, UH, THE EVENING HERE.

35:53.350 --> 35:56.046
- I'M SORRY. UH-OH.
- YOU CAN SEE THAT FROM SPACE.

35:56.080 --> 35:57.308
- I KNOW. I KNOW.

35:57.360 --> 35:59.521
IT'S GONNA TAKE ME MONTHS
TO WORK OVERTIME

35:59.570 --> 36:00.423
PAYING THAT OFF.

36:00.460 --> 36:01.392
- LEAST YOU HAVE A JOB.

36:01.430 --> 36:03.569
- WELL, I HEARD YOUR INTERVIEW
WENT WELL.

36:03.600 --> 36:04.942
- I GUESS.
I DIDN'T GET IT.

36:04.990 --> 36:06.082
- WHAT?
- REALLY?

36:06.120 --> 36:07.257
- WHY?

36:07.300 --> 36:08.779
- AND, ADAM, NEXT TIME
YOU HELP ME,

36:08.820 --> 36:09.889
MAYBE YOU COULD LET ME KNOW.

36:09.920 --> 36:12.195
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT
I GOT THAT INTERVIEW BY MYSELF

36:12.230 --> 36:14.539
AND [chuckles]
THEN I FOUND OUT I DIDN'T.

36:14.580 --> 36:16.616
- LISTEN, SARAH, DAD THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA.

36:16.650 --> 36:17.753
- REALLY?
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE USING?

36:17.790 --> 36:19.849
WHAT, ARE YOU 40 AND DAD THOUGHT
IT WAS A GOOD IDEA?

36:19.900 --> 36:22.585
- OH, THE GLOVES ARE OFF NOW.
- THAT'S A TERRIBLE REASON.

36:22.620 --> 36:24.099
- OKAY.
- I'M SORRY I DIDN'T TELL YOU.

36:24.140 --> 36:25.311
ALL RIGHT?
I SHOULD'VE TOLD YOU.

36:25.350 --> 36:26.271
I'M SORRY.
- THANK YOU.

36:26.320 --> 36:29.039
- HEY, HOW DID YOUR MEETING GO
WITH MAX?

36:29.080 --> 36:31.594
- YOU--IT'S OKAY.
YOU CAN TELL THEM.

36:31.630 --> 36:34.497
- IT'S OFFICIAL.
MAX HAS ASPERGER'S.

36:36.570 --> 36:39.038
- HEY.
- SORRY ABOUT THAT.

36:39.090 --> 36:40.114
- YEAH.
- WHAT AM I DOING?

36:40.160 --> 36:41.559
I'M, LIKE, STRAIGHTENING
YOUR TIE.

36:41.610 --> 36:42.599
- GET OFF.

36:42.640 --> 36:44.267
YOU KNOW, TO MAKE LIFE
EVEN SUCKIER,

36:44.300 --> 36:46.097
OUR PERFECT DAUGHTER
WAS HIDING A BAG OF WEED

36:46.130 --> 36:47.097
IN THE BACKYARD.

36:47.130 --> 36:48.119
- OH, WOW.
- I AM APPALLED.

36:48.170 --> 36:49.330
- AS YOUR LAWYER,

36:49.370 --> 36:50.507
I WOULD'VE ADVISED YOU
NOT TO BRING THAT

36:50.550 --> 36:51.756
TO THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
WHERE...

36:51.790 --> 36:52.859
- IT HAPPENED TO BE
IN MY POCKET.

36:52.900 --> 36:55.095
- HE WAS HUNTING A OPOSSUM
WHILE WEARING A BLAZER

36:55.140 --> 36:56.107
IN HIS UNDERWEAR.

36:56.140 --> 36:57.368
- THAT'S QUITE AN IMAGE
THERE.

36:57.420 --> 37:00.241
- SO IT WAS HADDIE'S?
AMBER DIDN'T LIE?

37:00.280 --> 37:01.588
AMBER TOLD THE TRUTH.

37:01.630 --> 37:02.619
- WELL, I'M GLAD THIS IS SUCH
GOOD NEWS FOR YOU.

37:02.660 --> 37:04.309
- AMBER TOLD THE TRUTH.
- HADDIE'S SMOKING POT.

37:04.360 --> 37:05.429
- WELL, AMBER TOLD ME
THE TRUTH.

37:05.460 --> 37:06.666
THAT'S HAPPENED, LIKE,
ONE OTHER TIME.

37:06.700 --> 37:08.736
- HOW'S IT GOING, CROSBY?
- HEY, WOULD YOU PUT THAT AWAY?

37:08.770 --> 37:09.839
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

37:09.880 --> 37:10.869
- HEY, LOOK, MAN,
I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

37:10.910 --> 37:12.639
WHAT KIND OF MISCHIEF
MY NIECE IS UP TO, OKAY?

37:12.670 --> 37:14.422
IT SMELLS
LIKE MEXICAN MISCHIEF.

37:14.470 --> 37:15.630
BUT IT COULD BE
HUMBOLDT MISCHIEF.

37:15.680 --> 37:18.399
- DO NOT LIGHT THAT.
DO NOT--

37:18.440 --> 37:20.021
- CROSBY, IF YOU GET ME
KICKED OUT OF THIS SCHOOL,

37:20.060 --> 37:22.233
I SWEAR TO GOD I WILL TAKE
YOUR SKINNY ASS DOWN.

37:22.270 --> 37:23.646
- WELL, IF YOU GET BOOTED,

37:23.680 --> 37:25.545
THEN MAYBE THAT HO WON'T TRY
TO RAW DOG YOUR HUSBAND.

37:25.580 --> 37:28.856
- I'M SO--WHAT?
- "RAW DOG." IS THAT A--?

37:28.900 --> 37:29.855
- I KNOW.
- WHAT IS THAT?

37:29.900 --> 37:31.276
- WHOA. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

37:31.310 --> 37:32.652
- SHE WAS ALL "JOEL BUILT
THIS WHOLE PLATFORM

37:32.690 --> 37:34.203
WITH HIS BARE HANDS,"
LIKE, YOU KNOW,

37:34.250 --> 37:35.581
HE'S FROM THE 14005
OR SOMETHING.

37:35.630 --> 37:37.279
- OKAY, JOEL WOULD NEVER.
- NO, HE WOULDN'T.

37:37.320 --> 37:39.459
- JOEL?
- NEVER EVER IN A MILLION YEARS.

37:39.490 --> 37:41.048
- AND SHE'S--SHE'S--
- SHE'S A TART.

37:41.080 --> 37:43.139
- [laughs]
- COME ON. PUT THAT OUT.

37:43.190 --> 37:45.146
- NOW IT'S IN SAFE HANDS.
HERE WE GO.

37:45.190 --> 37:47.533
UH-OH. UH-OH.
OH, MAMA BEAR'S...

37:47.570 --> 37:49.367
- KRISTINA? WHAT...

37:49.400 --> 37:50.879
- YOU GOT TO PUT HER
ON A SHORTER LEASH, MY MAN.

37:50.920 --> 37:51.739
LOOK AT THIS.

37:51.780 --> 37:53.668
- YOU GUYS,
THIS IS STILL ILLEGAL.

37:53.710 --> 37:55.268
YOU KNOW THAT?
STILL ILLEGAL.

37:55.300 --> 37:56.710
KRISTINA, WOULD YOU
PUT THAT OUT, PLEASE?

37:56.750 --> 37:58.718
COME ON, THIS IS ILLEGAL.
- DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

37:58.750 --> 38:00.718
- WHERE'D EVERYBODY GO?
- OH, MY GOD. MOM. IT'S MOM.

38:00.760 --> 38:02.443
- OH, GREAT.
- HERE COMES MOM.

38:02.480 --> 38:05.449
SHH. YOU GUYS.
- I NEEDED SOME AIR.

38:05.490 --> 38:07.037
- OH, YEAH.
- WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

38:07.070 --> 38:10.722
- NOTHING.
- HI, MOM. HI.

38:10.770 --> 38:13.762
- MOM, YOU LOOK SO SOFT
TONIGHT.

38:13.800 --> 38:15.244
[snickering]

38:15.290 --> 38:16.973
- OH, GOD, YOU GUYS,
YOU'RE SMOKING DOPE

38:17.010 --> 38:17.942
IN THE SCHOOL YARD.

38:17.980 --> 38:20.210
- I WAS NOT SMOKING DOPE.
- YOU IDIOTS.

38:20.260 --> 38:22.228
- MOM, ADAM'S A CHIMNEY.

38:22.260 --> 38:24.808
WE NEED TO GET HIM
INTO A FACILITY.

38:24.850 --> 38:26.818
[laughter]

38:26.850 --> 38:27.885
- GET HIM!
- RUN!

38:27.920 --> 38:29.717
- GET HIM!
- RUN!

38:33.720 --> 38:35.517
- I SHOULD'VE SEEN IT.
I SHOULD'VE CAUGHT IT.

38:35.550 --> 38:36.710
YOU WERE ALWAYS CONCERNED.

38:36.760 --> 38:37.579
I WAS ALWAYS TELLING YOU
IT WAS OKAY.

38:37.620 --> 38:39.588
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
I THINK THIS IS GOOD

38:39.620 --> 38:41.861
BECAUSE IF WE CAN BLAME
EVERYTHING ON YOU,

38:41.900 --> 38:43.868
IT'S GONNA MAKE EVERYTHING
BETTER.

38:43.900 --> 38:45.891
- YOU THINK SO?
- YEAH.

38:48.180 --> 38:50.660
- KRISTINA, I JUST--
I DON'T--

38:50.700 --> 38:52.281
I CAN DEAL WITH ANYTHING.

38:52.330 --> 38:54.184
I-I CAN DEAL WITH DISEASE,
WITH ILLNESS,

38:54.220 --> 38:55.596
WITH A BROKEN BONE.

38:55.640 --> 38:56.629
GIVE ME SOMETHING
I CAN FIX.

38:56.670 --> 38:58.467
BUT I JUST--I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO DEAL WITH THIS.

38:58.500 --> 38:59.467
THIS IS FOR LIFE.

38:59.500 --> 39:00.467
- NO, ADAM.
JUST STOP IT.

39:00.510 --> 39:03.195
I MEAN, COME ON.
YOU ONLY HEARD THE BAD PART.

39:03.230 --> 39:07.542
YOU DIDN'T HEAR EVERYTHING ELSE
THAT THE DOCTOR SAID.

39:07.580 --> 39:11.710
MAX IS--HE'S SMART,
AND HE'S BEAUTIFUL,

39:11.760 --> 39:14.968
AND THERE'S SO MUCH POTENTIAL.

39:15.000 --> 39:16.865
AND HOPE.

39:20.280 --> 39:22.009
- SO WHAT NOW?

39:24.940 --> 39:26.805
- WE START TO WORK.

39:40.200 --> 39:42.373
- HAVE A NICE DAY.

39:47.730 --> 39:50.722
- UNFORTUNATELY,
THERE'S NOT MUCH WE CAN DO.

39:50.760 --> 39:53.069
I'M AFRAID AMBER'S TRANSCRIPT
JUST DOESN'T JUSTIFY BEING

39:53.110 --> 39:54.384
IN THE ELEVENTH GRADE.

39:54.420 --> 39:57.901
- I KNOW. HER GRADES AT FRESNO
TOTALLY SUCKED.

39:57.940 --> 40:00.317
CAN'T ARGUE WITH THAT.

40:00.360 --> 40:03.773
THE THING ABOUT AMBER IS...

40:03.810 --> 40:08.702
THE HIDDEN SECRET ABOUT AMBER
IS SHE'S REALLY SMART.

40:08.750 --> 40:12.436
SHE JUST HASN'T GOTTEN
A BREAK, YOU KNOW?

40:12.470 --> 40:14.882
SHE HASN'T GOTTEN THE BREAK
THAT SHE DESERVES.

40:14.920 --> 40:16.785
AND THAT'S MY FAULT.

40:16.820 --> 40:19.789
AND I TAKE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR THAT.

40:19.830 --> 40:20.717
BUT THE REASON I CAME HERE--

40:20.760 --> 40:24.867
THE REASON I MOVED
MY FAMILY HERE IS...

40:24.900 --> 40:29.860
TO GIVE HER A CHANCE
TO BECOME MORE.

40:32.770 --> 40:34.931
I KNOW THE LAST THING YOU WANT
IS ANOTHER PARENT IN HERE

40:34.980 --> 40:37.039
ASKING FOR SPECIAL TREATMENT
FOR THEIR KID.

40:37.080 --> 40:40.322
BUT...

40:40.360 --> 40:42.328
I'M JUST AFRAID
THAT IF THE FIRST THING

40:42.370 --> 40:46.716
THAT HAPPENS TO HER HERE
IS THAT SHE GETS LEFT BACK...

40:46.750 --> 40:48.786
THAT SHE'S JUST GOING
TO SHUT DOWN.

40:48.820 --> 40:51.163
AND THE THING I WANT
MORE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD

40:51.200 --> 40:55.091
IS FOR HER NOT TO SHUT DOWN.

40:55.140 --> 40:59.440
'CAUSE I BELIEVE IN HER.

40:59.490 --> 41:03.381
YOU DON'T KNOW ME.
YOU DON'T KNOW HER.

41:03.420 --> 41:05.217
SO...

41:05.250 --> 41:08.902
BUT I GUESS I'M ASKING FOR YOU
TO BELIEVE IN HER TOO.

41:08.940 --> 41:12.216
[Paul Simon's
