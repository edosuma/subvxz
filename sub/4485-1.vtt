Ready?

01:29:44.846 --> 01:29:48.247
- Where you going?
- Yeah. I didn't get that much better.

01:29:48.883 --> 01:29:50.373
My ball.

01:29:57.225 --> 01:29:59.693
BRIAN: I'll let you have that one.
KEVIN: I got it back, right?

01:29:59.861 --> 01:30:02.329
BRIAN: It's a confidence booster, you see?
KEVIN: Yeah.

01:30:03.664 --> 01:30:05.598
No, you ain't gonna shoot.

01:30:07.802 --> 01:30:10.498
- Hey, where did you get that from?
BRIAN: You showed me that one.

01:30:21.349 --> 01:30:25.615
My new KD IVs,
the best basketball shoe ever made.

01:30:26.754 --> 01:30:28.654
I can cut like never before.

01:30:32.927 --> 01:30:34.155
Swish.

01:30:35.496 --> 01:30:36.520
My new KD IVs.

01:30:36.864 --> 01:30:38.855
I can do spin moves like never before.

01:30:48.276 --> 01:30:52.303
With my new KD IVs,
I can jump higher than ever before.

01:31:00.555 --> 01:31:02.147
I'm back.

01:31:03.305 --> 01:31:09.532
