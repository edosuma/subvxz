WELCOME TO THE SHOW,

STILL COMING TO YOU FROM

THIS BLANK VOID.

WHICH HAS STARTED TO FEEL A BIT

LIKE HOME.

00:35.700 --> 00:36.633
AND TO BE HONEST, IT IS PRETTY

00:36.700 --> 00:37.533
SIMILAR TO ENGLAND IN THAT

IT'S FRUSTRATINGLY WHITE,

IMMEDIATELY DEPRESSING,

ROLLING BACK ABORTION RIGHTS

01:18.333 --> 01:19.000
IS PRETTY MUCH THE REASON

A HUMAN BEER BONG SCREAM AND

01:21.166 --> 01:22.766
CRY DURING A JOB INTERVIEW,

01:22.833 --> 01:24.300
THE REASON EVERYONE FREAKED OUT

01:24.366 --> 01:25.233
WHEN AN 87-YEAR-OLD WOMAN DIED,

01:25.300 --> 01:26.866
AND THE REASON WHY THE PRESIDENT

01:26.933 --> 01:28.166
AND HALF HIS INNER CIRCLE ALL

01:28.233 --> 01:29.800
GOT COVID IN THE ROSE GARDEN --

01:29.866 --> 01:32.766

THIS DEPRESSINGLY SIGNIFICANT

01:35.900 --> 01:38.166

01:48.933 --> 01:49.866

01:49.933 --> 01:51.933
SIGNED THE BILL YESTERDAY.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.566
IT BANS THE PROCEDURE AS EARLY

01:54.633 --> 01:56.266
AS SIX WEEKS INTO A PREGNANCY,

01:56.333 --> 01:57.600
BEFORE MANY WOMEN EVEN KNOW

01:57.666 --> 01:58.533
THEY'RE PREGNANT.

01:58.600 --> 01:59.566
>> John: WELL, THAT'S

01:59.633 --> 02:01.333
INFURIATING.

02:01.400 --> 02:02.666
AND MADE SOMEHOW EVEN WORSE

02:02.733 --> 02:04.033
BY THE FACT THEY SEEMED TO CRAM

02:04.100 --> 02:05.966
THE FEW WOMEN IN THE ROOM RIGHT

02:06.033 --> 02:07.266

>> John: WOW.

03:05.566 --> 03:06.633
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY.

03:06.700 --> 03:08.000
WOMEN ARE TOO EMOTIONAL TO MAKE

03:08.066 --> 03:09.733
DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR OWN BODIES

03:09.800 --> 03:10.866

03:12.666 --> 03:14.200
HULKS OUT ON HIS DESK AT WORK.

FUCKING GAVEL DID.

03:19.333 --> 03:20.233
IN EVERY WAY, THAT IS THE EXACT

03:20.300 --> 03:21.033
OPPOSITE OF WHAT IS MEANT BY

03:21.100 --> 03:22.800
"BREAKING THE GLASS CEILING."

03:22.866 --> 03:24.266
AND THERE WILL CLEARLY BE MUCH

03:24.333 --> 03:25.633
MORE TO SAY ON THIS STORY AS IT

03:25.700 --> 03:26.900
UNFOLDS, BUT FOR NOW, LET'S TRY

03:26.966 --> 03:28.933
AND TAKE A LOOK AT NEWS THAT

03:29.000 --> 03:30.466
ISN'T ACTIVELY DEPRESSING.

03:30.533 --> 03:31.166

PHILADELPHIA, LARRY KRASNER,

03:33.133 --> 03:34.166
THE REFORM D.A., WON A HOTLY

03:34.233 --> 03:35.533
CONTESTED PRIMARY AND KRASNER'S

03:35.600 --> 03:37.200
VICTORY WAS BY NO MEANS ASSURED

03:37.266 --> 03:38.800
-- THE POLICE UNION BACKED

03:38.866 --> 03:40.666
HIS OPPONENT IN THE PRIMARY,

03:40.733 --> 03:41.866
AND HE'S COME UNDER ATTACK

03:41.933 --> 03:42.733
FOR BOLD REFORMS LIKE VOWING TO

03:42.800 --> 03:44.566
NEVER PURSUE A DEATH SENTENCE,

03:44.633 --> 03:45.166
REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE

03:45.233 --> 03:46.333
SENT TO PRISON BY SEEKING

03:46.400 --> 03:47.866
ALTERNATIVES TO INCARCERATION,

03:47.933 --> 03:49.800
AND TO STOP ILLEGAL

03:49.866 --> 03:50.166
STOP-AND-FRISK,

03:50.233 --> 03:50.766
REFORM CASH BAIL, AND END THE

03:50.833 --> 03:53.133
ABUSE OF CIVIL ASSET FORFEITURE.

03:53.200 --> 03:55.933
WHICH IS A STRIKING SET OF

03:56.000 --> 03:58.100
PROMISES, ESPECIALLY COMING FROM

03:58.166 --> 04:00.233
A GUY WHOSE FACE-SWEATER COMBO

04:00.300 --> 04:02.166
WHISPERS, "I'VE GOT AUDIOBOOKS

04:02.233 --> 04:03.266

04:03.333 --> 04:04.400
NOW, KRASNER STILL HAS TO FACE

04:04.466 --> 04:05.933
A REPUBLICAN IN THE GENERAL

04:06.000 --> 04:06.200
ELECTION.

04:06.266 --> 04:07.300
SPECIFICALLY, THIS MAN,

04:07.366 --> 04:08.600
CHARLES PERUTO.

04:08.666 --> 04:10.666
WHO IS A LOT.

04:10.733 --> 04:11.800
HIS PLATFORM IS THE ANTITHESIS

04:11.866 --> 04:13.133
OF KRASNER'S.

04:13.200 --> 04:14.900
AND HE'S SAID, "MY FIRST LINE OF

04:14.966 --> 04:17.633

04:17.700 --> 04:18.000

04:18.066 --> 04:19.066

WEST PHILADELPHIA,

04:24.066 --> 04:26.200

04:26.266 --> 04:26.800
I WAS BORN IN

04:26.866 --> 04:28.700
A MIXED NEIGHBORHOOD.

04:28.766 --> 04:30.966
I LOVED IT.

04:31.033 --> 04:33.266
IRONICALLY ENOUGH, THE KID

04:33.333 --> 04:33.866
I HUNG OUT WITH EVERY DAY WAS

04:33.933 --> 04:35.633
MICHAEL JACKSON.

04:35.700 --> 04:36.700
HE DIDN'T SING BUT HE PLAYED

04:36.766 --> 04:38.933
HOOPS.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.866
I UNDERSTAND BLACK PEOPLE JUST

04:40.933 --> 04:42.966

04:43.033 --> 04:44.900
NOT GONNA SAY -- I'M NOT GONNA

04:44.966 --> 04:45.700
SAY EQUAL, BUT PRETTY GOOD.

04:45.766 --> 04:47.233
>> John: OKAY.

04:47.300 --> 04:48.800
THAT GUY, SITTING IN THAT

04:48.866 --> 04:50.300
OFFICE, SAYING HE UNDERSTANDS

04:50.366 --> 04:51.666
BLACK PEOPLE AS WELL AS ANY

04:51.733 --> 04:52.833
BLACK PERSON ISN'T GREAT.

04:52.900 --> 04:54.333
EVEN IF HE DOES SLIGHTLY WALK IT

04:54.400 --> 04:56.966
BACK BY SAYING, "I'M NOT GONNA

04:57.033 --> 04:57.800
SAY EQUAL, BUT PRETTY GOOD" --

04:57.866 --> 04:58.733
A LEVEL OF NUANCE NOT SEEN SINCE

04:58.800 --> 05:01.066
PLESSY VS. FERGUSON.

05:01.133 --> 05:03.366
THE WHOLE VIDEO IS 35 MINUTES

05:03.433 --> 05:04.566
LONG, AND SHOT IN A SINGLE TAKE,

05:04.633 --> 05:06.166
WITH REAL "NO ONE IN MY FAMILY

05:06.233 --> 05:07.233
WANTS TO LISTEN TO ME ANYMORE

05:07.300 --> 05:08.933
SO THEY SHOWED ME HOW TO USE A

05:09.000 --> 05:10.033
WEBCAM" ENERGY.

05:10.100 --> 05:10.866
AND LOOK, PERUTO IS UNLIKELY TO

05:10.933 --> 05:12.800
WIN.

05:12.866 --> 05:14.266
BUT HE DOES SPEAK TO THE

05:14.333 --> 05:14.966
POST-TRUMP TREND WHERE EXTREME

05:15.033 --> 05:18.233
CARTOONISHNESS ISN'T A

05:18.300 --> 05:18.866
DEAL BREAKER FOR CANDIDATES --

05:18.933 --> 05:20.266
IT'S A SELLING POINT.

05:20.333 --> 05:22.000
TAKE MISSOURI'S MARK McCLOSKEY,

05:22.066 --> 05:22.500
WHO YOU MIGHT REMEMBER

05:22.566 --> 05:23.500
AS THE MAN WHO POINTED A GUN

05:23.566 --> 05:25.033
AT BLACK LIVES MATTER PROTESTERS

05:25.100 --> 05:25.833
WHILE SOMEHOW MAKING

05:25.900 --> 05:27.800
A POLO SHIRT SLUTTY.

05:27.866 --> 05:30.200
WELL, THIS WEEK, HE DECLARED

05:30.266 --> 05:30.800
HIS CANDIDACY FOR SENATE WITH

05:30.866 --> 05:32.133
THIS AD:

05:32.200 --> 05:33.866
>> WHEN THE ANGRY MOB CAME TO

05:33.933 --> 05:36.033
DESTROY MY HOUSE AND KILL MY

05:36.100 --> 05:37.133
FAMILY, I TOOK A STAND AGAINST

05:37.200 --> 05:38.500
THEM.

05:38.566 --> 05:39.600
NOW I'M ASKING FOR THE PRIVILEGE

05:39.666 --> 05:40.900
TO TAKE THAT STAND FOR ALL OF

05:40.966 --> 05:42.866
US.

05:42.933 --> 05:49.000
I WILL NEVER BACK DOWN.

05:49.066 --> 05:50.133
>> John: OKAY.

05:50.200 --> 05:51.233
SETTING ASIDE THE FACT

05:51.300 --> 05:51.866
McCLOSKEY LOOKS LIKE WHAT YOU'D

05:51.933 --> 05:53.100
GET IF SEAN HANNITY FUCKED

05:53.166 --> 05:54.066
A PACKING PEANUT -- "WHEN THE

05:54.133 --> 05:54.700

05:54.766 --> 05:57.000

05:57.066 --> 05:57.400
GET OVER YOURSELF!

05:57.466 --> 05:58.900
THOSE WERE PROTESTERS WALKING

05:58.966 --> 05:59.966
PAST YOUR YARD ON THEIR WAY TO

06:00.033 --> 06:01.400
THE MAYOR'S HOUSE.

06:01.466 --> 06:02.633
NO ONE CARED ABOUT YOU UNTIL

06:02.700 --> 06:03.300
YOU STARTED WAVING GUNS

06:03.366 --> 06:05.266
IN THEIR FACE.

06:05.333 --> 06:06.700
AND SIDE NOTE: IF THERE ARE

06:06.766 --> 06:08.266
NATIONWIDE PROTESTS AGAINST

06:08.333 --> 06:09.466
RACISM AND YOUR FIRST RESPONSE

06:09.533 --> 06:11.366
IS "THEY'RE COMING FOR ME!"

06:11.433 --> 06:12.800
MAYBE THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT SAYS

06:12.866 --> 06:14.466
ABOUT YOU.

06:14.533 --> 06:15.400
AND I'D SAY McCLOSKEY'S WAS

06:15.466 --> 06:17.000
THE MOST RIDICULOUS CAMPAIGN

06:17.066 --> 06:18.133
ANNOUNCEMENT THIS WEEK,

06:18.200 --> 06:19.900
WERE IT NOT FOR THE FACT THAT

06:19.966 --> 06:21.433
ANDREW GIULIANI -- SON OF RUDY

06:21.500 --> 06:22.366
-- IS NOW RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR

06:22.433 --> 06:24.433
OF NEW YORK.

06:24.500 --> 06:25.833
AND EVEN FOX NEWS POINTED OUT,

06:25.900 --> 06:26.966
HE'S DOING SO ON THE THINNEST

06:27.033 --> 06:28.400
POSSIBLE RESUME.

06:28.466 --> 06:30.500
>> ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S

06:30.566 --> 06:31.766
BEING ASKED ABOUT YOU IS IF

06:31.833 --> 06:33.266
YOU HAVE THE EXPERIENCE

06:33.333 --> 06:35.333
TO TAKE ON THE JOB OF GOVERNOR.

06:35.400 --> 06:36.333
YOU WORKED AT THE TRUMP

06:36.400 --> 06:38.133
WHITE HOUSE FOR FOUR YEARS,

06:38.200 --> 06:38.733
AND WERE A PROFESSIONAL GOLFER

06:38.800 --> 06:39.900
BEFORE THAT.

06:39.966 --> 06:41.666
>> THE TRUTH IS, MARTHA, FROM AN

06:41.733 --> 06:43.200
EXPERIENCE PERSPECTIVE, I MAY BE

06:43.266 --> 06:44.833
35 YEARS OLD, BUT YOU GOTTA

06:44.900 --> 06:45.800
REMEMBER, I SPENT 32 YEARS --

06:45.866 --> 06:47.366
PARTS OF 32 YEARS -- IN POLITICS

06:47.433 --> 06:50.100
AND IN GOVERNMENT.

06:50.166 --> 06:53.400
I'M THE ONLY ANNOUNCED CANDIDATE

06:53.466 --> 06:54.600
THAT ACTUALLY HAS SPENT PARTS OF

06:54.666 --> 06:56.866
FIVE DECADES IN POLITICS.

06:56.933 --> 06:58.000
SO I MAY LOOK YOUNG, BUT I

06:58.066 --> 06:59.300
CERTAINLY FEEL A LOT OLDER.

06:59.366 --> 07:00.966
>> John: OKAY.

07:01.033 --> 07:02.333
THERE IS A LOT TO TAKE APART AND

07:02.400 --> 07:03.800
PUT BACK TOGETHER THERE.

07:03.866 --> 07:05.066
ONE -- DO YOU THINK YOU

07:05.133 --> 07:06.900
LOOK YOUNG?

07:06.966 --> 07:08.966
BECAUSE IF I HAD TO GUESS

07:09.033 --> 07:09.766
YOUR AGE, I'D PUT YOU SOMEWHERE

07:09.833 --> 07:11.766
BETWEEN "UNHEALTHY 45" AND

07:11.833 --> 07:13.333
"LYING ABOUT AN EARLY RETIREMENT

07:13.400 --> 07:14.433

07:14.500 --> 07:16.066
SETTLEMENT BECOMING PUBLIC."

07:16.133 --> 07:17.833
ALSO, WHY WOULD YOU CLAIM TO

07:17.900 --> 07:18.466
HAVE BEEN IN POLITICS SINCE YOU

07:18.533 --> 07:20.000
WERE THREE YEARS OLD?

07:20.066 --> 07:21.366
UNLESS YOU'RE COUNTING BEING

07:21.433 --> 07:23.466
VIOLENTLY HELD BY YOUR FATHER

07:23.533 --> 07:25.233
DURING HIS FAILED 1989 MAYORAL

07:25.300 --> 07:26.166
CAMPAIGN WHILE DRESSED AS

07:26.233 --> 07:30.433
BUSINESS CHUCKY.

07:30.500 --> 07:31.233
ARE YOU COUNTING THAT?

07:31.300 --> 07:32.533
AND EVEN CALLING GIULIANI

07:32.600 --> 07:33.300
A "PROFESSIONAL GOLFER" NEEDS

07:33.366 --> 07:34.133
MORE CONTEXT, BECAUSE HIS CAREER

07:34.200 --> 07:35.833
HIGHLIGHTS INCLUDE BEING KICKED

07:35.900 --> 07:37.100
OFF THE DUKE GOLF TEAM FOR BAD

07:37.166 --> 07:38.733
BEHAVIOR LIKE ALLEGEDLY THROWING

07:38.800 --> 07:42.900

07:42.966 --> 07:45.033
FACE SO HARD, THE APPLE

EXPLODED, AND THEN APPEARING ON

08:00.200 --> 08:01.566

08:01.633 --> 08:02.733

08:08.466 --> 08:09.033

08:09.100 --> 08:10.233
>> THAT'S TOTALLY A TREE.

08:10.300 --> 08:12.200

08:13.600 --> 08:15.666
IF IT HAD EARS.

08:17.500 --> 08:19.033
AND WE ALL TELL HIM HE DOES BUT,

08:19.100 --> 08:19.966
IT ALMOST MAKES HIM -- I FEEL

08:20.033 --> 08:21.866
LIKE HE WANTS TO TALK MORE.

08:21.933 --> 08:22.766

THE ONLY GROUND TURKEY THAT'S

13:03.400 --> 13:06.166
93% LEAN AND 100% FUCKABLE.

13:06.233 --> 13:07.400
GET YOUR FUCK FILL

13:07.466 --> 13:09.166
WITH HONEYSUCKLE.

13:09.233 --> 13:11.600
NOW, CLEARLY, MAINTAINING

13:11.666 --> 13:12.966
JOURNALISTIC INDEPENDENCE

13:13.033 --> 13:13.566
FROM ADVERTISERS IS CRITICALLY

13:13.633 --> 13:14.566
IMPORTANT.

13:14.633 --> 13:15.533
SO IMPORTANT, IN FACT, IT'S

13:15.600 --> 13:17.100
FREQUENTLY REFERRED TO AS THE

13:17.166 --> 13:19.433
"CHURCH-STATE WALL."

13:19.500 --> 13:22.266
AND THE FCC HAS RULES REQUIRING

13:22.333 --> 13:23.266
BROADCAST STATIONS TO ANNOUNCE

13:23.333 --> 13:24.933
WHEN CONTENT HAS BEEN SPONSORED

13:25.000 --> 13:26.833
OR PAID FOR IN ANY WAY.

13:26.900 --> 13:28.766
UNFORTUNATELY, MANY LOCAL

13:28.833 --> 13:29.966
STATIONS HAVE EITHER COMPLETELY

13:30.033 --> 13:31.466
BROKEN THOSE RULES, OR VIOLATED

13:31.533 --> 13:32.633
THE SPIRIT OF THEM, THROUGH

13:32.700 --> 13:33.433
A PRACTICE KNOWN AS

13:33.500 --> 13:35.500
"SPONSORED CONTENT."

13:35.566 --> 13:36.533
IT'S WHERE ADVERTISING IS

13:36.600 --> 13:38.166
BLENDED DIRECTLY INTO THE

13:38.233 --> 13:39.633
BROADCASTS, AND IT'S BOTH

13:39.700 --> 13:40.866
MORE WIDESPREAD, AND HARDER TO

13:40.933 --> 13:42.466
DETECT, THAN YOU MIGHT REALIZE.

13:42.533 --> 13:44.900
SO TONIGHT, LET'S TALK ABOUT

13:44.966 --> 13:46.100
SPONSORED CONTENT.

13:46.166 --> 13:47.700
AND LET'S START WITH THE STUFF

13:47.766 --> 13:49.500
THAT SEEMS ESSENTIALLY HARMLESS:

13:49.566 --> 13:50.433
PEOPLE GETTING PAID TO HAWK

13:50.500 --> 13:52.800
PRODUCTS ON TV.

13:52.866 --> 13:54.233
THERE'S AN INDUSTRY OF LIFESTYLE

13:54.300 --> 13:57.366
EXPERTS THAT DO THIS.

13:57.433 --> 13:58.466
HERE IS ONE OF THEM EXPLAINING

13:58.533 --> 13:59.000
THE PROCESS TO POTENTIAL

13:59.066 --> 13:59.366
CLIENTS.

13:59.433 --> 14:01.166
>> BRANDIGRATION IS WHERE A

14:01.233 --> 14:02.566
BRAND, ITS PRODUCT, AND THE

14:02.633 --> 14:03.433
MESSAGING ARE ALL WORKED

14:03.500 --> 14:05.200
TOGETHER WITHIN THE CONTENT OF

14:05.266 --> 14:07.433
A SHOW IN A PRE-PLANNED MANNER.

14:07.500 --> 14:09.500
WITH SO MANY SHOWS OFFERING

14:09.566 --> 14:10.033
INTEGRATED CONTENT, IT CAN

14:10.100 --> 14:10.933
BE HARD TO CHOOSE.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.266
BUT LET'S START WITH LOCAL,

14:12.333 --> 14:13.566
OKAY?

14:13.633 --> 14:15.266
WE HAVE A METHOD THAT HELPS

14:15.333 --> 14:16.966
ME GET INTERVIEWS IN A SNAP.

14:17.033 --> 14:17.566
>> HI, MICHELLE!

14:17.633 --> 14:19.800
>> HEY THERE, JER-BEAR!

14:19.866 --> 14:21.233
>> HI, MICHELLE!

14:21.300 --> 14:24.100
>> HEY, GIRL, HOW YOU DOING?

14:24.166 --> 14:25.166
>> SEE?

14:25.233 --> 14:26.600
IN AN INSTANT, WE HAVE ACCESS

14:26.666 --> 14:27.633
TO SHOWS ACROSS THE NATION

14:27.700 --> 14:29.566
THAT ARE READY FOR YOUR

14:29.633 --> 14:29.800
CONTENT.

14:29.866 --> 14:30.533
>> John: WOW.

14:30.600 --> 14:31.500
I GOTTA SAY, THAT IS PRETTY

14:31.566 --> 14:33.133
IMPRESSIVE.

14:33.200 --> 14:34.800
THE ONLY PERSON I CAN SUMMON

14:34.866 --> 14:35.633
WITH A SNAP OF MY FINGERS IS

14:35.700 --> 14:38.166
GEORGE CLOONEY.

14:38.233 --> 14:40.766
WATCH.

14:40.833 --> 14:41.400
THERE HE IS.

14:41.466 --> 14:41.833
>> HELLO?

14:41.900 --> 14:42.433
>> John: HEY, GEORGE!

14:42.500 --> 14:45.600
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

14:45.666 --> 14:47.100
>> UHHH...

14:47.166 --> 14:51.000
I'M DOING FINE.

14:51.066 --> 14:52.633
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

14:52.700 --> 14:53.766
>> John: I'M JUST SHOWING PEOPLE

14:53.833 --> 14:54.633
HOW I CAN SUMMON YOU WITH A

14:54.700 --> 14:57.766
SIMPLE SNAP OF MY FINGERS.

14:57.833 --> 14:58.333
>> I'M EATING DINNER.

14:58.400 --> 15:03.300
I GAVE YOU THIS POWER TO USE IN

15:03.366 --> 15:04.166
A LIMITED CAPACITY, JOHN.

15:04.233 --> 15:04.733
>> John: UNDERSTOOD, GEORGE.

15:04.800 --> 15:05.600
BYE!

15:05.666 --> 15:06.400
>> BYE.

15:06.466 --> 15:07.466
>> John: SEE?

15:07.533 --> 15:08.666
THE SYSTEM WORKS!

15:08.733 --> 15:09.933
BUT THE TRUTH IS, MICHELLE

15:10.000 --> 15:10.900
DIDN'T JUST HAVE THE POWER

15:10.966 --> 15:11.466
TO MAKE PEOPLE APPEAR OUT OF

15:11.533 --> 15:11.833
THIN AIR.

15:11.900 --> 15:13.066
SHE ALSO, CRUCIALLY, HAD THE

15:13.133 --> 15:14.033
POWER TO MAKE THEM PLAY ALONG

15:14.100 --> 15:14.833
AS SHE HAWKED HORRIFYING

15:14.900 --> 15:18.033
PRODUCTS LIKE THESE.

15:18.100 --> 15:18.866
>> THESE ARE THE NEW FRENCH'S

15:18.933 --> 15:20.900
CRISPY JALAPENOS.

15:20.966 --> 15:22.066
ONE FUN IDEA IS TO USE IT IN

15:22.133 --> 15:24.766
THIS JALAPENO CHEESEBURGER DIP.

15:24.833 --> 15:26.466
THIS IS SERIOUSLY EVERYTHING

15:26.533 --> 15:27.133
YOU LOVE ABOUT A CHEESEBURGER

15:27.200 --> 15:31.766
IN DIP FORM.

15:31.833 --> 15:32.833
TAKE A LOOK, IS THIS THING

15:32.900 --> 15:33.233
GORGEOUS OR WHAT?

15:33.300 --> 15:33.733
THIS THING HAS JUST HIT

15:33.800 --> 15:34.133
THE PARTY SCENE.

15:34.200 --> 15:35.000
IT'S THE VELVETTA SHELLS AND

15:35.066 --> 15:35.833
CHEESE LIFE SIZE LIQUID GOLD

15:35.900 --> 15:37.166
FOUNTAIN.

15:37.233 --> 15:39.800
>> OKAY, SO, A FEW THINGS I LOVE

15:39.866 --> 15:41.066
ARE DORITOS, MELTED CHEESE

15:41.133 --> 15:43.000
STICKS, AND NACHOS, AND NOW

15:43.066 --> 15:44.266
THERE'S A WAY YOU CAN ENJOY THEM

15:44.333 --> 15:45.533
ALL IN ONE.

15:45.600 --> 15:47.400
THESE ARE DORITOS LOADED.

15:47.466 --> 15:48.433
IT IS A TOTALLY NEW WAY

15:48.500 --> 15:50.533
TO EXPERIENCE DORITOS.

15:50.600 --> 15:51.200
>> THAT'S A REALLY FUN TWIST

15:51.266 --> 15:51.866
ON A SNACK IDEA.

15:51.933 --> 15:53.500
>> ISN'T IT?

15:53.566 --> 15:54.966
>> John: NO!

15:55.033 --> 15:56.300
NO, IT ISN'T!

15:56.366 --> 15:57.133
NOW THAT PRODUCT HAS SINCE BEEN

15:57.200 --> 15:57.733
DISCONTINUED.

15:57.800 --> 15:58.733
PROBABLY BECAUSE IT LOOKS LESS

15:58.800 --> 15:59.633
LIKE A SNACK, AND MORE LIKE

15:59.700 --> 16:00.733
SOMEONE DEEP-FRIED A FIDGET

16:00.800 --> 16:02.233
SPINNER.

16:02.300 --> 16:02.933
AND YOU PROBABLY ASSUMED

16:03.000 --> 16:04.300
MICHELLE WAS GETTING PAID

16:04.366 --> 16:06.400
TO DO THAT.

16:06.466 --> 16:07.900
BUT INTERESTINGLY, THE STATION

16:08.000 --> 16:09.333
WAS ALSO GETTING PAID TO HAVE

16:09.400 --> 16:11.066
HER ON.

16:11.133 --> 16:14.433
AND WHILE THE FCC REQUIRES

16:14.500 --> 16:15.000
SPONSORED CONTENT LIKE THAT

16:15.066 --> 16:15.733
TO BE LABELED, IT HAS NO

16:15.800 --> 16:17.200
REQUIREMENTS FOR EXACTLY HOW

16:17.266 --> 16:18.800
OR FOR HOW LONG.

16:18.866 --> 16:21.166
SO FOR INSTANCE, IN THE CASE OF

16:21.233 --> 16:21.966
DORITOS LOADED, THE DISCLOSURE

16:22.033 --> 16:29.533
CAME AT THE VERY END OF THE

16:29.600 --> 16:33.966
SEGMENT FOR JUST TWO SECONDS.

16:34.033 --> 16:34.600
SO SIX SECONDS TOTAL.

16:34.666 --> 16:35.500
WHICH IS, INCIDENTALLY, ABOUT

16:35.566 --> 16:36.266
THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME DORITOS

16:36.333 --> 16:37.133
LOADED STAY IN YOUR BODY BEFORE

16:37.200 --> 16:37.933
BEING FORCIBLY EJECTED FROM

16:38.000 --> 16:38.433
WHATEVER ORIFICE THEY'RE

16:38.500 --> 16:40.233
CLOSEST TO.

16:40.300 --> 16:42.266
THIS PRACTICE CAN BE SO

16:42.333 --> 16:42.866
LUCRATIVE THAT MANY BIG CHAINS

16:42.933 --> 16:44.766
HAVE NOW SET UP TEMPLATES FOR

16:44.833 --> 16:49.933
LOCAL SHOWS, BUILT AROUND

16:50.000 --> 16:51.700
SPONSORED CONTENT.

16:51.766 --> 16:52.966
SCRIPPS HAS "MORNING BLEND,"

16:53.033 --> 16:53.700
TEGNA HAS "GREAT DAY," NEXSTAR

16:53.766 --> 16:55.866
HAS "DAYTIME," AND SINCLAIR HAS,

16:55.933 --> 16:56.700
I CAN ONLY ASSUME, "THE MUSLIMS

16:56.766 --> 16:59.300
ATTACK AT DAWN."

16:59.366 --> 17:01.000
AND IT'S NOT JUST BRAND EXPERTS

17:01.066 --> 17:02.466
JOINING BY SATELLITE.

17:02.533 --> 17:04.933
SOMETIMES LOCAL BUSINESSES WILL

17:05.000 --> 17:06.500
PAY FOR AN INTERVIEW, WHERE THEY

17:06.566 --> 17:07.833
CAN SCRIPT THE QUESTIONS, AND

17:07.900 --> 17:08.400
MAKE SURE THEY'RE PRESENTED

17:08.466 --> 17:10.200
GLOWINGLY.

17:10.266 --> 17:10.600
TAKE JIM HEAFNER.

17:10.666 --> 17:11.833
UNTIL RECENTLY, HE WAS A

17:11.900 --> 17:12.933
FINANCIAL ADVISER IN CHARLOTTE,

17:13.000 --> 17:14.733
NORTH CAROLINA, WHO WAS ON THE

17:14.800 --> 17:16.466
LOCAL SHOW "MORNING BREAK"

17:16.533 --> 17:17.966
ALL THE TIME, AND WAS ALWAYS

17:18.033 --> 17:18.700
INTRODUCED IN VERY POSITIVE

17:18.766 --> 17:24.466
TERMS.

17:24.533 --> 17:26.033
>> WE HAVE JIM HEAFNER, HE IS A

17:26.100 --> 17:27.433
CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER, THE

17:27.500 --> 17:29.500
PRESIDENT AND CEO OF HEAFNER

17:29.566 --> 17:30.800
FINANCIAL, A BEST-SELLING

17:30.866 --> 17:32.666
AUTHOR, JUST AN ALL-AROUND GREAT

17:32.733 --> 17:32.833
GUY.

17:32.900 --> 17:33.433
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING

17:33.500 --> 17:33.900
BACK HERE.

17:33.966 --> 17:34.800
YOU'RE A REGULAR HERE.

17:34.866 --> 17:35.466
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING

17:35.533 --> 17:38.200
BACK WITH US.

17:38.266 --> 17:38.766
>> YOU ARE WELCOME.

17:38.833 --> 17:39.466
>> WE LIKE WHEN YOU'RE HERE.

17:39.533 --> 17:40.866
>> WE'RE SO GLAD TO HAVE YOU

17:40.933 --> 17:41.466
BACK BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA HELP

17:41.533 --> 17:42.100
OUR FOLKS GET FINANCIALLY FIT.

17:42.166 --> 17:42.700
>> WELCOME BACK, MR. HEAFNER!

17:42.766 --> 17:43.300
WE LOVE WHEN YOU ARE HERE WITH

17:43.366 --> 17:43.566
US, SIR.

17:43.633 --> 17:45.566
>> THIS MAN KNOWS HIS STUFF.

17:45.633 --> 17:47.100
>> John: THAT LEVEL OF

17:47.166 --> 17:50.900
ENTHUSIASTIC COSIGNING SEEMS

17:50.966 --> 17:51.600
PRETTY CONVINCING UNTIL YOU

17:51.666 --> 17:52.733
REMIND YOURSELF, THE STATION

17:52.800 --> 17:53.833
WAS BEING PAID TO SAY THOSE

17:53.900 --> 17:54.666
THINGS ABOUT HIM.

17:54.733 --> 17:56.900
IT'S THE REASON NO ONE WHO GETS

17:56.966 --> 17:59.633
A BIRTHDAY CAMEO FROM GARY BUSEY

17:59.700 --> 18:01.500
THINKS, "WOW, GARY BUSEY HOPES

18:01.566 --> 18:02.533
I MAKE IT TO 156 YEARS OLD?

18:02.600 --> 18:04.966
HE MUST BE MY BEST FRIEND."

18:05.033 --> 18:06.800
INSTEAD, THEY THINK, "WOW, CRAIG

18:06.866 --> 18:08.500
JUST WASTED $350 GETTING

18:08.566 --> 18:09.900
GARY BUSEY TO WISH ME

18:09.966 --> 18:11.366
A HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

18:11.433 --> 18:13.300
HE MUST BE MY BEST FRIEND."

18:13.366 --> 18:15.000
AND IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT

18:15.066 --> 18:20.000
HEAFNER AND THE FIRM HE WORKED

18:20.066 --> 18:22.866
NOT ONLY WERE ORDERED TO PLAY

18:22.933 --> 18:23.900
$1 MILLION IN AN ARBITRATION

18:23.966 --> 18:25.300
CASE THAT HE LOST RETIREES'

18:25.366 --> 18:28.266
MONEY COME ABOUT 22 CLAYTON'S

18:28.333 --> 18:28.500
RECENTLY

18:28.566 --> 18:29.066
SEEKING DAMAGES RELATED TO

18:29.133 --> 18:29.333
SUED HIM,

18:29.400 --> 18:29.900
THE LOSS OF $2.7 MILLION OF

18:29.966 --> 18:30.566
THEIR INVESTMENTS, WITH ONE OF

18:30.633 --> 18:31.300
THEM EVEN SAYING HE TRUSTED

18:31.366 --> 18:32.400
HEAFNER BECAUSE HE "BELIEVED

18:32.466 --> 18:33.633
THE LONGEST-RUNNING CHARLOTTE

18:33.700 --> 18:34.333
STATION WOULD INVITE ON

18:34.400 --> 18:35.066
TRUSTED EXPERTS."

18:35.133 --> 18:36.266
AND YEAH!

18:36.333 --> 18:37.866
OF COURSE YOU'D BELIEVE THAT!

18:37.933 --> 18:38.633
PEOPLE TRUST THEIR

18:38.700 --> 18:44.566
LOCAL STATION!

18:44.633 --> 18:45.400
THAT'S THE POINT HERE!

18:45.466 --> 18:46.800
AND IT DOESN'T STOP AT THESE

18:46.866 --> 18:47.400
LOCAL LIFESTYLE SHOWS --

18:47.466 --> 18:48.433
COMPANIES HAVE ALSO BOUGHT THEIR

18:48.500 --> 18:49.133
WAY DIRECTLY INTO LOCAL NEWS

18:49.200 --> 18:51.333
BROADCASTS.

18:51.400 --> 18:53.966

19:08.766 --> 19:09.633
DURING THE EVENING NEWS,

19:09.700 --> 19:10.933
AND IN HINDSIGHT, THE TONE OF

UPBEAT.

19:32.366 --> 19:33.533
POSITIVE SPIN: NO TIME LIKE THE

19:33.600 --> 19:34.166
PRESENT TO HAVE PROSTATE CANCER.

19:34.233 --> 19:35.200
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

19:35.266 --> 19:37.066
AND DESPITE HOW HE SIGNED OFF,

19:37.133 --> 19:38.333
IS MARK KOBEL ACTUALLY REPORTING

19:38.400 --> 19:38.900
THERE?

19:38.966 --> 19:40.100
BECAUSE, IN RETROSPECT, IT SEEMS

19:40.166 --> 19:41.666
MORE LIKE MARK KOBEL PARROTING

19:41.733 --> 19:42.933
THE ABSURDLY SUNNY CANCER

19:43.000 --> 19:44.500
PROPAGANDA OF HIS BUSINESS

19:44.566 --> 19:49.600
DADDY'S FAVORITE MONEY FRIEND.

19:49.666 --> 19:50.566
BUT I WILL SAY THIS, AT LEAST

19:50.633 --> 19:51.100
THAT'S AN INSTANCE OF

19:51.166 --> 19:52.033
A BROADCASTER ACTING SO

19:52.100 --> 19:52.933
EGREGIOUSLY, THE FCC WAS ABLE

19:53.000 --> 19:54.366
TO TAKE ACTION.

19:54.433 --> 19:56.566
A LOT OF THE TIME, STATIONS ARE

19:56.633 --> 19:58.466
DOING JUST ENOUGH DISCLOSURE

19:58.533 --> 19:59.900
TO STAY THE RIGHT SIDE OF

19:59.966 --> 20:01.666
THE FCC, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN

20:01.733 --> 20:02.533
THEY'RE NOT DOING MASSIVE HARM

20:02.600 --> 20:03.866
TO THEIR CREDIBILITY.

20:03.933 --> 20:06.833
BECAUSE EVEN WHEN A SPONSORSHIP

20:06.900 --> 20:08.933
IS PROPERLY DISCLOSED, I'D ARGUE

20:09.000 --> 20:10.566
THERE ARE CERTAIN BUSINESSES

20:10.633 --> 20:12.300
LOCAL STATIONS SHOULD NOT BE

20:12.366 --> 20:13.633
SELLING THEMSELVES OUT FOR.

20:13.700 --> 20:14.533
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO

20:14.600 --> 20:15.866
MEDICINE.

20:15.933 --> 20:17.833
BECAUSE A SURPRISING NUMBER

20:17.900 --> 20:18.666
OF SEGMENTS ON THESE SHOWS ARE

20:18.733 --> 20:20.833
ENTHUSIASTIC, UNCRITICAL

20:20.900 --> 20:22.566
SHOWCASES FOR EXPENSIVE

20:22.633 --> 20:23.833
TREATMENTS OR DEVICES,

20:23.900 --> 20:24.633
FEATURING CLAIMS THAT ARE,

20:24.700 --> 20:25.633
TO PUT IT CHARITABLY,

20:25.700 --> 20:26.933
MEDICALLY DUBIOUS.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.533
LIKE THIS PRODUCT,

20:28.600 --> 20:29.733
WHICH MADE IT ONTO A REGULAR

20:29.800 --> 20:30.966
MORNING NEWSCAST IN UTAH.

20:31.033 --> 20:32.400
>> TODAY, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

20:32.466 --> 20:33.333
A TECHNOLOGY AIMED TO HELP MEN

20:33.400 --> 20:35.333
WITH A SERIOUS ISSUE.

20:35.400 --> 20:37.600
STEPHANIE AND DUSTIN WOLFF,

20:37.666 --> 20:38.966
THE CO-INVENTORS OF THE WORLD'S

20:39.033 --> 20:42.966
FIRST CLINICALLY TESTED HOME USE

20:43.033 --> 20:45.466
SHOCK WAVE DEVICE TO TREAT

20:45.533 --> 20:46.200
ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION.

20:46.266 --> 20:46.700
IT'S CALLED THE ROCKET.

20:46.766 --> 20:47.700
>> THIS IS THE ROCKET.

20:47.766 --> 20:48.866
SO THE ROCKET WORKS ON THE

20:48.933 --> 20:50.266
PRINCIPLE OF LOW-INTENSITY

20:50.333 --> 20:51.400
SOUND WAVE THERAPY, WHICH HAS

20:51.466 --> 20:52.600
ACTUALLY BEEN AROUND IN EUROPE

20:52.666 --> 20:54.000
FOR ABOUT 25 YEARS.

20:54.066 --> 20:55.200
IT'S VERY EFFECTIVE.

20:55.266 --> 20:57.200
IT'S SAFE.

20:57.266 --> 20:58.133
AND IT'S -- THE TECHNOLOGY'S

20:58.200 --> 21:00.566
FDA RECOGNIZED.

21:00.633 --> 21:02.366
>> John: OKAY, FIRST, THAT

21:02.433 --> 21:04.633
VIBRATING TAINT MISSILE LOOKS

21:04.700 --> 21:05.600
UTTERLY TERRIFYING.

21:05.666 --> 21:06.466
AND WHILE IT'S SINCE BEEN

21:06.533 --> 21:08.066
REBRANDED FROM "THE ROCKET" TO

21:08.133 --> 21:09.500
"THE PHOENIX," I'M NOT SURE "PUT

21:09.566 --> 21:10.900
THIS BIRD THAT DESTROYS ITSELF

21:10.966 --> 21:12.566
IN FIRE NEAR YOUR PENIS" IS MUCH

21:12.633 --> 21:14.033
OF AN UPGRADE.

21:14.100 --> 21:15.066
BUT SECOND: WHAT DOES

21:15.133 --> 21:19.300
"FDA RECOGNIZED" EVEN MEAN?

21:19.366 --> 21:20.866
IT DEFINITELY DOESN'T MEAN IT'S

21:20.933 --> 21:21.366
"FDA CLEARED," MUCH LESS

21:21.433 --> 21:23.266
"APPROVED."

21:23.333 --> 21:25.866
AND THE FDA TOLD US THE PHOENIX

21:25.933 --> 21:27.100
IS "REGISTERED" WITH THEM,

21:27.166 --> 21:28.500
AS A THERAPEUTIC MASSAGER,

21:28.566 --> 21:30.100
THOUGH, NOT AS A DEVICE TO TREAT

21:30.166 --> 21:31.733
ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION.

21:31.800 --> 21:33.600
AND AT THIS POINT, I LEGALLY

21:33.666 --> 21:34.800
HAVE TO TELL YOU,

21:34.866 --> 21:36.366
THE MANUFACTURER OF THE PHOENIX

21:36.433 --> 21:39.133
SAYS THEY MAKE NO EXPLICIT

21:39.200 --> 21:42.466
CLAIMS ABOUT TREATING E.D.

21:42.533 --> 21:44.266
WHICH IS A LITTLE ODD, BECAUSE

21:44.333 --> 21:46.733
THEIR OWN WEBSITE CLAIMS THAT

21:46.800 --> 21:49.066
PHOENIX OFFERS PROVEN TECHNOLOGY

21:49.133 --> 21:49.766
TO MAKE YOUR

21:49.833 --> 21:52.400
PENIS HARDER," WHICH THEY

21:52.466 --> 21:55.633
AND YOU CAN COMPLETE THIS

21:55.700 --> 21:57.600
TREATMENT IN YOUR HOME.

21:57.666 --> 21:57.866
WHICH THEY

21:57.933 --> 22:00.733
PRESUMABLY FEEL JUSTIFIES

22:00.800 --> 22:04.400
ITS PRICE TAG OF HOLY SHIT $879.

22:04.466 --> 22:05.200
BUT THAT IS NOT THE POINT HERE.

22:05.266 --> 22:06.266
THE POINT IS, IF YOU'RE GOING TO

22:06.333 --> 22:06.900
ALLOW THAT PRODUCT INTO THE BODY

22:06.966 --> 22:08.500
OF YOUR LOCAL NEWSCAST,

22:08.566 --> 22:09.300
YOU MIGHT WANT TO HAVE SOME VERY

22:09.366 --> 22:09.966
POINTED QUESTIONS READY, AND NOT

22:10.033 --> 22:10.833
END THE SEGMENT LIKE THIS.

22:10.900 --> 22:11.866
>> AND OF COURSE IF YOU WANT TO

22:11.933 --> 22:12.700
FIND MORE INFORMATION, WHERE CAN

22:12.766 --> 22:13.533
THEY FIND IT ONLINE, GUYS?

22:13.600 --> 22:13.933
>> THEY CAN GO TO

22:14.000 --> 22:14.366
GetMyRocket.com.

22:14.433 --> 22:16.300
>> THERE YOU GO.

22:16.366 --> 22:17.566
GET THAT HELP YOU NEED FOR

22:17.633 --> 22:18.400
WHATEVER AILMENT YOU'VE GOT

22:18.466 --> 22:18.733
RIGHT HERE.

22:18.800 --> 22:20.100
>> John: YEAH!

22:20.166 --> 22:21.000
USE THE ROCKET FOR WHATEVER

22:21.066 --> 22:22.166
AILMENT YOU'VE GOT!

22:22.233 --> 22:24.366
ESPECIALLY IF THAT AILMENT IS

22:24.433 --> 22:28.400
HAVING 879 TOO MANY DOLLARS.

22:28.466 --> 22:30.300
AND THE THING IS, THAT'S FAR

22:30.366 --> 22:31.166
FROM THE ONLY WEIRD MEDICAL

22:31.233 --> 22:32.600
PRODUCT THAT'S BEEN PRESENTED

22:32.666 --> 22:33.666
UNCRITICALLY DURING SPONSORED

22:33.733 --> 22:35.100
SEGMENTS.

22:35.166 --> 22:37.000
DENVER'S MILE-HIGH LIVING

22:37.066 --> 22:38.033
FEATURED A SPA OWNER PROMOTING

22:38.100 --> 22:40.166
THIS EXCITING NEW TREATMENT:

22:40.233 --> 22:41.933
>> MONA LISA TOUCH IS THE FIRST

22:42.000 --> 22:42.833
FDA-CLEARED LASER TO TREAT

22:42.900 --> 22:44.166
THE VAGINA, AND IN DOING SO,

22:44.233 --> 22:44.766
IT TREATS THE SYMPTOMS OF

22:44.833 --> 22:46.100
VAGINAL ATROPHY.

22:46.166 --> 22:46.800
>> SO THE PROCEDURE ITSELF,

22:46.866 --> 22:48.166
IS IT PAINFUL?

22:48.233 --> 22:50.133
>> NO.

22:50.200 --> 22:50.766
IT'S -- TYPICALLY, WHAT YOU'LL

22:50.833 --> 22:52.166
FEEL ARE MILD VIBRATIONS.

22:52.233 --> 22:53.166
I TEASE, THE NEXT DAY YOU MIGHT

22:53.233 --> 22:54.566
FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE A SUNBURNED

22:54.633 --> 22:56.766
VAGINA, BUT IT'S JUST HEALING.

22:56.833 --> 22:57.733
>> John: OH, THAT'S OKAY, THEN.

22:57.800 --> 22:59.000
IT'S JUST YOUR TYPICAL,

22:59.066 --> 23:00.600
EVERYDAY, SUNBURNED VAGINA.

23:00.666 --> 23:02.266
AND ONLY CAUSED BY A LASER.

23:02.333 --> 23:02.933
SO REALLY, JUST YOUR TYPICAL,

23:03.000 --> 23:04.100
EVERYDAY, LASER-ROASTED

23:04.166 --> 23:05.633
GENITALIA.

23:05.700 --> 23:06.966
WHICH IS JUST HEALING.

23:07.033 --> 23:07.666
FROM THE LASER YOU DELIBERATELY

23:07.733 --> 23:09.333
BURNED IT WITH.

23:09.400 --> 23:10.300
IT BEING THE INSIDE

23:10.366 --> 23:11.066
OF YOUR VAGINA.

23:11.133 --> 23:12.266
YOUR RUN-OF-THE-MILL

23:12.333 --> 23:14.933
LASER-CHARRED VAGINA.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.700
AND IF USING A LASER AS A

23:16.766 --> 23:19.066
MEDICAL PSEUDO-DILDO SEEMS LIKE

23:19.133 --> 23:19.933
A SCARY THING TO DO: YOU HAVE

23:20.000 --> 23:22.066
GOOD INSTINCTS.

23:22.133 --> 23:24.366
BECAUSE OVER A YEAR BEFORE THAT

23:24.433 --> 23:25.966
SEGMENT AIRED, THE FDA ISSUED A

23:26.033 --> 23:26.933
SAFETY ALERT, MAKING IT CLEAR

23:27.000 --> 23:28.333
THAT THEY HAVE NOT CLEARED OR

23:28.400 --> 23:32.400
APPROVED FOR MARKETING ANY

23:32.466 --> 23:33.000
ENERGY-BASED DEVICES TO TREAT

23:33.066 --> 23:34.200
VAGINAL ATROPHY, AND APPLYING

23:34.266 --> 23:35.466
ENERGY-BASED THERAPIES TO

23:35.533 --> 23:36.566
THE VAGINA MAY LEAD TO VAGINAL

23:36.633 --> 23:37.766
BURNS, SCARRING, AND RECURRING

23:37.833 --> 23:39.866
OR CHRONIC PAIN.

23:39.933 --> 23:41.433
AND THE PROBLEM IS, SEGMENTS

23:41.500 --> 23:42.733
WITH DICEY MEDICAL CLAIMS ARE

23:42.800 --> 23:45.333
JUST EVERYWHERE.

23:45.400 --> 23:46.466
RECENTLY, THE FDA HAS WARNED

23:46.533 --> 23:47.733
ABOUT THE USE OF UNAPPROVED

23:47.800 --> 23:48.900
STEM CELL THERAPIES,

23:48.966 --> 23:50.633
WHICH THEY SAY CAN BE HARMFUL.

23:50.700 --> 23:52.166
BUT YOU WOULDN'T KNOW THAT

23:52.233 --> 23:55.200
TO WATCH SOME OF THESE SHOWS.

23:55.266 --> 23:56.466
HERE'S A SEGMENT FROM

23:56.533 --> 23:57.833
"GOOD MORNING TEXAS," FEATURING

23:57.900 --> 23:58.866
A DOCTOR WHO'S BEEN DISCIPLINED

23:58.933 --> 24:00.033
MULTIPLE TIMES BY THE STATE

24:00.100 --> 24:01.333
MEDICAL BOARD FOR SEPARATE

24:01.400 --> 24:03.133
ISSUES, CLAIMING HIS STEM CELL

24:03.200 --> 24:05.200
THERAPY CAN TREAT THINGS LIKE

24:05.266 --> 24:06.900
M.S. AND PARKINSON'S, DESPITE

24:06.966 --> 24:10.333
THE FACT THAT STEM CELLS HAVE

24:10.400 --> 24:10.966
NEVER BEEN APPROVED TO TREAT ANY

24:11.033 --> 24:12.433
NEUROLOGICAL DISORDER.

24:12.500 --> 24:13.566
AND IT'S NOT JUST HIM -- HERE'S

24:13.633 --> 24:15.333
A NATUROPATHIC DOCTOR, MAKING

24:15.400 --> 24:16.033
SIMILARLY BASELESS CLAIMS ON A

24:16.100 --> 24:18.000
STATION IN ARIZONA.

24:18.066 --> 24:18.666
>> SO, WHAT KIND OF CONDITIONS

24:18.733 --> 24:20.100
ARE YOU TREATING WITH THIS?

24:20.166 --> 24:21.300
>> SO, WE TREAT SO MANY

24:21.366 --> 24:23.433
DIFFERENT KINDS OF CONDITIONS.

24:23.500 --> 24:25.133
WE CAN DO IT TO JOINTS,

24:25.200 --> 24:26.466
WE'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF

24:26.533 --> 24:28.433
THAT -- SYSTEMIC THINGS AS WELL.

24:28.500 --> 24:29.733
INCLUDING, WE'VE HAD A PATIENT

24:29.800 --> 24:30.800
WITH CHRON'S DISEASE RECENTLY.

24:30.866 --> 24:32.600
HAD A PATIENT WITH HEART DISEASE

24:32.666 --> 24:33.100
WHO WAS IN SEVERE HEART

24:33.166 --> 24:34.266
FAILURE.

24:34.333 --> 24:35.266
BOTH OF THEM WITHIN A WEEK OF

24:35.333 --> 24:37.233
GETTING THESE STEM CELLS ARE

24:37.300 --> 24:38.533
JUST FEELING GREAT AND IMPROVED

24:38.600 --> 24:39.033
TO ALMOST NORMAL.

24:39.100 --> 24:40.966
>> WOW!

24:41.033 --> 24:44.833
>> John: YEAH, WOW!

24:44.900 --> 24:45.200
INDEED!

24:45.266 --> 24:46.300
THAT CARD SUGGESTED HE CAN TREAT

24:46.366 --> 24:48.633
PARKINSONS, ALZHEIMERS, AUTISM,

24:48.700 --> 24:49.833
M.S. AND ALS.

24:49.900 --> 24:51.066
IT SEEMS THE ONLY THING HIS

24:51.133 --> 24:52.700
STEM CELLS CAN'T DO IS HELP THAT

24:52.766 --> 24:54.600
STATION PROOFREAD THEIR LIST OF

24:54.666 --> 24:55.433
"CONDITIONS CAN STEM CELL

24:55.500 --> 24:56.333
THERAPY BENEFIT."

24:56.400 --> 24:57.233
BECAUSE OTHER THAN THAT,

24:57.300 --> 25:00.666
GOT YOU THEY COVERED HAVE!

25:00.733 --> 25:01.766
AND LOOK, WHILE THERE IS NO WAY

25:01.833 --> 25:02.700
OF KNOWING EXACTLY HOW MANY

25:02.766 --> 25:04.133
PEOPLE ARE WATCHING THESE SHOWS

25:04.200 --> 25:06.800
AS THEY AIR, THAT'S NOT REALLY

25:06.866 --> 25:08.300
THE POINT, AS THIS MARKETING

25:08.366 --> 25:09.366
EXECUTIVE AT NEXSTAR EXPLAINED

25:09.433 --> 25:11.033
TO POTENTIAL ADVERTISERS.

25:11.100 --> 25:12.466
>> NOW, HERE'S THE DEAL.

25:12.533 --> 25:14.133
MOST PEOPLE THINK, "OKAY, SO I

25:14.200 --> 25:15.700
GO ON THE TV SHOW, I'M ON TV,

25:15.766 --> 25:17.200
GREAT, THIS IS AWESOME, AND IT

25:17.266 --> 25:18.033
AIRS AT 4:00, I GO ON, GREAT,

25:18.100 --> 25:19.366
AND PEOPLE SEE ME, OKAY,

25:19.433 --> 25:24.633
SO THIS IS COOL."

25:24.700 --> 25:26.100
I'M GONNA TELL YOU RIGHT NOW,

25:26.166 --> 25:27.633
WHEN YOU ACTUALLY GO ON AND DO

25:27.700 --> 25:29.800
THAT, THAT ISN'T EVEN THE CAKE.

25:29.866 --> 25:31.433
THAT'S JUST THE ICING.

25:31.500 --> 25:34.800
YOU KNOW WHAT THE CAKE IS?

25:34.866 --> 25:38.200
THE VIDEO FILE.

25:38.266 --> 25:38.433
[LAUGHS]

25:38.500 --> 25:39.633
AT THE END, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A

25:39.700 --> 25:40.933
FOUR OR FIVE MINUTE VIDEO FILE.

25:41.000 --> 25:41.533
AND YOU'RE GONNA DO WHAT WITH

25:41.600 --> 25:41.700
IT?

25:41.766 --> 25:44.633
POST IT EVERYWHERE!

25:44.700 --> 25:45.000
[LAUGHS]

25:45.066 --> 25:45.866
>> John: OKAY, FIRST OF ALL:

25:45.933 --> 25:47.133
WHAT IS THAT MOTION?

25:47.200 --> 25:49.900
THAT IS UNNECESSARILY GROSS.

25:49.966 --> 25:50.766
THIS ISN'T HOW YOU REPRESENT

25:50.833 --> 25:52.566
CAKE AND ICING.

25:52.633 --> 25:53.533
THIS IS HOW YOU BRING A

25:53.600 --> 25:54.966
MASH'S HAM TO ORGASM.

25:55.033 --> 25:57.233
YOU GIVE IT THE OL' WIGGLE AND

25:57.300 --> 25:57.833
SQUEEZE, AND THEN A TWIST AND

25:57.900 --> 25:58.366
A SNAP.

25:58.433 --> 25:59.500
OH, SHIT!

25:59.566 --> 26:01.833
>> WHAT IS IT?

26:01.900 --> 26:05.466
>> John: SORRY, GEORGE.

26:05.533 --> 26:06.600
I'M SORRY.

26:06.666 --> 26:07.133
THAT ONE WAS GENUINELY AN

26:07.200 --> 26:07.533
ACCIDENT.

26:07.600 --> 26:08.400
I WAS JUST TRYING TO SHOW PEOPLE

26:08.466 --> 26:09.266
HOW TO BRING A MASH'S HAM TO

26:09.333 --> 26:09.500
ORGASM.

26:09.566 --> 26:13.100
>> THAT'S NOT HOW YOU DO IT.

26:13.166 --> 26:16.833
>> John: OH.

26:16.900 --> 26:17.466
I GUESS THAT'S GOOD INFORMATION

26:17.533 --> 26:18.000
TO HAVE.

26:18.066 --> 26:18.633
THE POINT IS, THAT MARKETING

26:18.700 --> 26:19.666
EXECUTIVE IS RIGHT.

26:19.733 --> 26:20.833
THE CAKE IS THE VIDEO FILE,

26:20.900 --> 26:21.700
AND COMPANIES WILL TAKE THAT

26:21.766 --> 26:22.866
VIDEO AND RUN WITH IT.

26:22.933 --> 26:23.933
REMEMBER THAT NATUROPATHIC

26:24.000 --> 26:24.866
DOCTOR WHO CLAIMED STEM CELLS

26:24.933 --> 26:25.500
ARE A TREATMENT FOR ALZHEIMER'S

26:25.566 --> 26:27.833
AND AUTISM?

26:27.900 --> 26:29.600
HERE'S HIS WEBSITE, WHICH

26:29.666 --> 26:30.833
PROUDLY FEATURES THE MANY TIMES

26:30.900 --> 26:32.833
HE WAS GIVEN AN UNCRITICAL

26:32.900 --> 26:36.833
PLATFORM ON TRUSTED LOCAL TV.

26:36.900 --> 26:37.400
AND YOU MIGHT THINK VIEWERS

26:37.466 --> 26:38.466
SHOULD BE SMART ENOUGH TO

26:38.533 --> 26:39.366
APPROACH ANYTHING ON THESE SHOWS

26:39.433 --> 26:43.566
WITH SKEPTICISM.

26:43.633 --> 26:49.066
THE THING IS, THOUGH, MANY OF

26:49.133 --> 26:49.700
THESE STATIONS ALSO SWAP FIGURES

26:49.766 --> 26:50.466
FROM THEIR NEWSROOM TO THEIR

26:50.533 --> 26:51.300
SPONSORED CONTENT SHOWS.

26:51.366 --> 26:53.500
AT ABC4 UTAH, FOR INSTANCE,

26:53.566 --> 26:54.000
SURAE CHINN IS BOTH THE

26:54.066 --> 26:54.500
CHANNEL'S CHIEF MEDICAL

26:54.566 --> 26:55.600
CORRESPONDENT AND A HOST OF

26:55.666 --> 26:56.733
THE SPONSORED CONTENT SHOW

26:56.800 --> 26:59.033
"GOOD THINGS UTAH."

26:59.100 --> 27:00.266
AND IT REALLY DOES FEEL LIKE A

27:00.333 --> 27:02.500
LINE IS GETTING BLURRED THERE.

27:02.566 --> 27:04.733
AND LOOK, IDEALLY, STATIONS

27:04.800 --> 27:05.833
WOULDN'T ENGAGE IN THIS PRACTICE

27:05.900 --> 27:06.766
AT ALL -- OR, AT THE VERY LEAST,

27:06.833 --> 27:08.466
THEIR DISCLOSURES WOULD BE

27:08.533 --> 27:09.466
HARDER FOR VIEWERS TO MISS,

27:09.533 --> 27:10.800
AND THEY'D DO SIGNIFICANTLY

27:10.866 --> 27:12.466
MORE WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT

27:12.533 --> 27:14.566
IF THEY'RE LETTING SOMEONE BUY

27:14.633 --> 27:16.300
THEIR WAY ONTO THEIR CHANNEL,

27:16.366 --> 27:17.700
AND PRESENT SOMETHING AS REAL,

27:17.766 --> 27:18.700
THAT IT'S NOT, IN FACT, TOTAL

27:18.766 --> 27:19.800
NONSENSE.

27:19.866 --> 27:21.333
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, IT'S FAR TOO

27:21.400 --> 27:23.200
EASY TO MAKE A RIDICULOUS

27:23.266 --> 27:24.100
PRODUCT THAT MAKES OUTLANDISH

27:24.166 --> 27:25.366
CLAIMS, AND GET IT ONTO

27:25.433 --> 27:27.366
LOCAL TV.

27:27.433 --> 27:29.266
AND THE REASON I KNOW THAT IS,

27:29.333 --> 27:30.600
WE DID.

27:30.666 --> 27:32.266
WE STARTED A COMPANY CALLED

27:32.333 --> 27:33.766
VENUS INVENTIONS, AND CREATED

27:33.833 --> 27:35.966
SOMETHING CALLED THE VENUS VEIL.

27:36.033 --> 27:37.633
AN ABSURD MEDICAL PRODUCT BASED

27:37.700 --> 27:38.766
ON TECHNOLOGY THAT ABSOLUTELY

27:38.833 --> 27:41.733
DOES NOT EXIST.

27:41.800 --> 27:43.566
WE SET UP THIS WEBSITE, AND EVEN

27:43.633 --> 27:45.533
HIRED AN ACTRESS TO BRANDIGRATE

27:45.600 --> 27:46.833
THE SHIT OUT OF THE VENUS VEIL,

27:46.900 --> 27:47.433
INTO SHOWS IT HAD NO BUSINESS

27:47.500 --> 27:48.633
BEING ON.

27:48.700 --> 27:51.466
DID IT WORK?

27:51.533 --> 27:52.833
I DUNNO -- YOU TELL ME,

27:52.900 --> 27:55.266
ABC 4 UTAH!

27:55.333 --> 27:57.100
>> I'M SO EXCITED TO TALK WITH

27:57.166 --> 27:58.966
ERICA HERNANDEZ WITH

27:59.033 --> 28:01.933
THE VENUS VEIL, A REVOLUTIONARY

28:02.000 --> 28:02.700
NEW PRODUCT ON THE LINE.

28:02.766 --> 28:03.766
WHAT EXACTLY IS IT?

28:03.833 --> 28:05.866
I'M SO INTRIGUED.

28:05.933 --> 28:06.400
>> I'M SO GLAD YOU ARE

28:06.466 --> 28:07.500
INTRIGUED.

28:07.566 --> 28:09.666
SO THIS IS THE VENUS VEIL.

28:09.733 --> 28:10.500
IT IS THE WORLD'S FIRST

28:10.566 --> 28:12.500
SEXUAL HEALTH BLANKET.

28:12.566 --> 28:14.400
>> John: YEP!

28:14.466 --> 28:16.333
THAT WAS ON ABC 4 LAST FRIDAY.

28:16.400 --> 28:17.966
AND I'D LOVE TO TELL YOU IT WAS

28:18.033 --> 28:19.166
DIFFICULT TO GET IT ON, BUT IT

28:19.233 --> 28:21.100
REALLY WASN'T.

28:21.166 --> 28:22.633
AND REMEMBER, THAT'S THEIR

28:22.700 --> 28:24.366
CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT.

28:24.433 --> 28:26.000
AND IT SEEMS STRIKING THAT

28:26.066 --> 28:27.700
SHE DIDN'T HAVE ANY FOLLOW-UPS

28:27.766 --> 28:28.666
ON CLAIMS WE MADE ABOUT THE VEIL

28:28.733 --> 28:30.233
THAT YOU'D HOPE A MEDICAL

28:30.300 --> 28:31.266
CORRESPONDENT WOULD IMMEDIATELY

28:31.333 --> 28:33.300
TAKE ISSUE WITH.

28:33.366 --> 28:34.600
>> THE VEIL IS BEING DESIGNED

28:34.666 --> 28:36.633
WITH THE HOPE THAT IT WILL

28:36.700 --> 28:38.566
PRECISELY DRAW OUT THE NATURAL

28:38.633 --> 28:41.333
ALKALINE UNDERCURRENTS OF THE

28:41.400 --> 28:42.633
VAGINA, AND INITIATE A LOW-GRADE

28:42.700 --> 28:44.200
STATE OF WHAT WE CALL

28:44.266 --> 28:46.233
MICRO-DEATH, WHICH SOUNDS

28:46.300 --> 28:48.033
INCREDIBLY SCARY, BUT THAT'S

28:48.100 --> 28:49.433
ACTUALLY JUST RESTARTING THAT

28:49.500 --> 28:50.733
AREA'S NATURAL LIFE CYCLE.

28:50.800 --> 28:52.566
IT'S USING THIS FIELD OF

28:52.633 --> 28:54.333
MAGNETO-GENETICS I WAS TALKING

28:54.400 --> 28:55.800
ABOUT, AND ALSO A TECHNOLOGY

28:55.866 --> 28:57.200
THAT'S BEEN AROUND FOR A REALLY

28:57.266 --> 28:58.500
LONG TIME THAT WAS PIONEERED IN

28:58.566 --> 29:00.800
GERMANY ABOUT 80 YEARS AGO.

29:00.866 --> 29:02.166
SO THIS IS FULL OF CUTTING-EDGE

29:02.233 --> 29:02.766
TECHNOLOGY, BUT IT JUST LOOKS

29:02.833 --> 29:04.100
LIKE A BLANKET.

29:04.166 --> 29:07.866
>> John: YEAH!

29:07.933 --> 29:08.833
IT DOES.

29:08.900 --> 29:09.866
AND THAT'S BECAUSE IT IS.

29:09.933 --> 29:10.566
IT IS JUST A BLANKET.

29:10.633 --> 29:11.433
ALSO, TECHNOLOGY THAT WAS

29:11.500 --> 29:11.966
PIONEERED IN GERMANY ABOUT

29:12.033 --> 29:13.133
80 YEARS AGO?

29:13.200 --> 29:14.466
I WOULD HAVE SOME QUESTIONS

29:14.533 --> 29:15.633
ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR PERIOD

29:15.700 --> 29:18.200
IN GERMAN HISTORY.

29:18.266 --> 29:19.433
AND I KNOW THAT LOOKS BAD.

29:19.500 --> 29:20.666
BUT LET'S BE FAIR HERE,

29:20.733 --> 29:22.900
IT'S JUST AN ISOLATED EXAMPLE.

29:22.966 --> 29:23.866
THERE WAS NO WAY ANOTHER STATION

29:23.933 --> 29:24.433
WAS GOING TO FALL FOR THIS.

29:24.500 --> 29:25.433
RIGHT?

29:25.500 --> 29:28.266
ABSOLUTELY NO WAY.

29:28.333 --> 29:30.433
IS THERE, KVUE AUSTIN?

29:30.500 --> 29:31.500
BECAUSE YOU WOULDN'T HAVE LET US

29:31.566 --> 29:33.066
PAY TO DIRECTLY FOLLOW YOUR

29:33.133 --> 29:34.066
10:00 PM LOCAL NEWS THIS

29:34.133 --> 29:35.633
THURSDAY, WOULD YOU?

29:35.700 --> 29:37.933
THERE'S NO WAY THAT HAPPENED.

29:38.000 --> 29:38.733
>> IT INCLUDES SOME PRETTY

29:38.800 --> 29:39.833
INTERESTING TECHNOLOGY.

29:39.900 --> 29:41.333
>> YES, IT DOES.

29:41.400 --> 29:42.600
SO THE TEAM BEHIND THE VEIL

29:42.666 --> 29:43.400
WAS INSPIRED BY THE FIELD OF

29:43.466 --> 29:44.633
MAGNETO-GENETICS.

29:44.700 --> 29:46.200
BUT BASICALLY, YOUR BLOOD IS

29:46.266 --> 29:47.666
FULL OF IRON, BUT IT'S DISPERSED

29:47.733 --> 29:49.133
IN SUCH A WAY IT ISN'T AFFECTED

29:49.200 --> 29:50.566
BY NORMAL MAGNETS.

29:50.633 --> 29:51.800
SO THE IDEA BEHIND THE VEIL IS

29:51.866 --> 29:53.633
WITH THE RIGHT BLEND OF

29:53.700 --> 29:54.933
PROPRIETARY MAGNETIC FIBERS,

29:55.000 --> 29:57.033
YOU CAN CREATE A SELF-CONTAINED

29:57.100 --> 29:59.200
MAGNETIC FIELD THAT RESTIMULATES

29:59.266 --> 30:00.633
BLOOD FLOW AND GETS YOU FEELING

30:00.700 --> 30:01.633
LIKE YOUR NORMAL SELF AGAIN.

30:01.700 --> 30:03.066
>> VERY INTERESTING.

30:03.133 --> 30:04.433
>> John: IS IT?

30:04.500 --> 30:06.400
IS IT INTERESTING?

30:06.466 --> 30:07.533
OR IS THAT OBVIOUS BULLSHIT THAT

30:07.600 --> 30:08.666
DEFINITELY SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN

30:08.733 --> 30:10.033
ON IN THE SAME HOUR

30:10.100 --> 30:11.533
AS COVERAGE OF THE CEASE-FIRE

30:11.600 --> 30:12.933
IN THE MIDDLE EAST,

30:13.000 --> 30:13.800
A SHORTAGE OF LIFEGUARDS IN

30:13.866 --> 30:14.700
LOCAL PUBLIC POOLS, AND AN

30:14.766 --> 30:15.766
INVESTIGATIVE PIECE

30:15.833 --> 30:17.000
ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND

30:17.066 --> 30:17.966
BAIL REFORM?

30:18.033 --> 30:19.866
ONE OF THESE THINGS IS NOT LIKE

30:19.933 --> 30:21.433
THE OTHERS, AND IT'S DEFINITELY

30:21.500 --> 30:23.566
OUR NAZI-ERA FUCK BLANKET.

30:23.633 --> 30:25.833
BUT SURELY, IF YOU SAW THIS

30:25.900 --> 30:29.900
BLANKET IN PERSON, THEN,

30:29.966 --> 30:30.333
IN A STUDIO,

30:30.400 --> 30:31.800
YOU WOULD KNOW NOT TO

30:31.866 --> 30:33.333
ENTHUSIASTICALLY COSIGN ON

30:33.400 --> 30:33.966
THE COMPLETELY BASELESS CLAIMS

30:34.033 --> 30:34.666
BEING MADE RIGHT IN FRONT

30:34.733 --> 30:36.000
OF YOU.

30:36.066 --> 30:38.533
YOU'D PROTECT YOUR VIEWERS FROM

30:38.600 --> 30:39.366
THAT HAPPENING, WOULDN'T YOU,

30:39.433 --> 30:41.000
DENVER'S "MILE HIGH LIVING?"

30:41.066 --> 30:43.466
>> THIS IS MEANT TO TREAT SEXUAL

30:43.533 --> 30:44.700
CONDITIONS, BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE

30:44.766 --> 30:46.433
ARE EMBARRASSED TO TALK ABOUT

30:46.500 --> 30:48.666
THEIR SEXUAL HEALTH, RIGHT?

30:48.733 --> 30:49.566
SO IT WAS DESIGNED TO BE

30:49.633 --> 30:51.900
SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY DISCRETE

30:51.966 --> 30:54.700
AND ALSO REALLY STYLISH SO YOU

30:54.766 --> 30:55.433
CAN HAVE IT IN YOUR HOME AND IT

30:55.500 --> 30:56.066
REALLY -- I MEAN, COULD IT LOOK

30:56.133 --> 30:57.266
LESS LIKE A MEDICAL PRODUCT?

30:57.333 --> 30:57.833
>> YEAH, NO, IT DOESN'T LOOK

30:57.900 --> 30:58.233
LIKE THAT.

30:58.300 --> 31:00.233
YOU KNOW, AGAIN, IT'S ONE OF

31:00.300 --> 31:00.833
THOSE THINGS I THINK A LOT OF

31:00.900 --> 31:01.466
PEOPLE RIGHT NOW ARE LOOKING

31:01.533 --> 31:01.966
TO ENHANCE THEIR LIVES,

31:02.033 --> 31:02.833
BUT THEY ALSO DON'T WANT

31:02.900 --> 31:03.766
ANYTHING TOO INVASIVE.

31:03.833 --> 31:05.166
>> RIGHT, YEAH.

31:05.233 --> 31:06.233
>> SO THIS IS SOMETHING WHERE,

31:06.300 --> 31:06.800
AGAIN, YOU'RE NOT NEEDING A

31:06.866 --> 31:07.466
PRESCRIPTION OR ANYTHING LIKE

31:07.533 --> 31:08.000
THAT AS WELL.

31:08.066 --> 31:09.066
>> YES.

31:09.133 --> 31:09.866
>> WELL, THANK YOU, ERICA.

31:09.933 --> 31:10.500
THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING IN

31:10.566 --> 31:10.833
TODAY.

31:10.900 --> 31:11.700
WE APPRECIATE IT.

31:11.766 --> 31:12.500
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING

31:12.566 --> 31:12.900
ME.

31:12.966 --> 31:13.500
THANKS FOR MAKING IT SO EASY.

31:13.566 --> 31:14.400
THIS WAS GREAT.

31:14.466 --> 31:14.900
>> YEAH, SUPER EASY.

31:14.966 --> 31:15.600
>> John: YEAH!

31:15.666 --> 31:17.000
SUPER EASY!

31:17.066 --> 31:18.566
YOU COULD EVEN ARGUE

31:18.633 --> 31:20.366
"WAY TOO EASY."

31:20.433 --> 31:21.933
BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS, NONE OF

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
THIS WAS NEARLY DIFFICULT ENOUGH

31:23.066 --> 31:24.566
TO GET ONTO TV.

31:24.633 --> 31:28.633
AND IT WASN'T EVEN EXPENSIVE.

31:28.700 --> 31:30.666
THAT COST JUST $2800.

31:30.733 --> 31:33.266
THIS ONE COST $2650.

31:33.333 --> 31:35.066
AND THIS ONE ONLY COST $1750.

31:35.133 --> 31:36.800
IT WAS ALL SHOCKINGLY

31:36.866 --> 31:38.100
AFFORDABLE, AND SADLY, ON SOME

31:38.166 --> 31:39.133
STATIONS, DIDN'T EVEN LOOK THAT

31:39.200 --> 31:42.833
OUT OF PLACE.

31:42.900 --> 31:43.833
AND THAT IS NOT GOOD.

31:43.900 --> 31:45.966
BECAUSE, AS WE'VE SAID FOR

31:46.033 --> 31:46.766
YEARS NOW, THE INTEGRITY OF

31:46.833 --> 31:47.866
LOCAL NEWS IS CRUCIALLY

31:47.933 --> 31:50.766
IMPORTANT.

31:50.833 --> 31:51.500
AND THERE IS REAL HARM FOR

31:51.566 --> 31:52.400
EVERYONE IF THAT INTEGRITY

31:52.466 --> 31:53.700
IS DAMAGED.

31:53.766 --> 31:55.300
SO TO THE OWNERS OF THESE

31:55.366 --> 31:57.766
STATIONS WHO ARE SELLING THEM

31:57.833 --> 31:58.700
OUT AT A DEPRESSINGLY CHEAP

31:58.766 --> 32:01.066
PRICE, I HAVE A SIMPLE QUESTION.

32:01.133 --> 32:01.733
IF I MAY QUOTE THE WORDS OF A

32:01.800 --> 32:02.966
VERY WISE NEWS ANCHOR:

32:03.033 --> 32:05.366
THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?

32:05.433 --> 32:06.633
THAT'S OUR SHOW.

32:06.700 --> 32:08.800
THANKS SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

32:08.866 --> 32:10.833
IF YOU WANT TO SEE OUR VENUS

32:10.900 --> 32:12.533
VEIL SEGMENTS IN FULL -- THE

32:12.600 --> 32:13.266
WHOLE CAKE, IF YOU WILL -- YOU

32:13.333 --> 32:14.166
CAN GO TO VenusInventions.com.

32:14.233 --> 32:17.466
GOOD NIGHT!

32:17.533 --> 32:19.700
>> ARE THERE ANY SIDE EFFECTS OF
