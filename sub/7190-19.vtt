09:13.386 --> 09:14.720
- You're gonna love it.

09:14.804 --> 09:16.973
- I think we have some
in the fridge.

09:17.056 --> 09:19.058
But it's jalapeño,
mushroom, butterscotch...

09:20.601 --> 09:22.645
Not one of our
better combinations.

09:22.728 --> 09:25.731
- Hey, better than
brains, though, right?

09:25.815 --> 09:27.733
- How about I make
some pancakes?

09:27.817 --> 09:28.776
- Pancakes?

09:33.406 --> 09:34.490
- Thank you.

09:34.573 --> 09:35.825
You're right.

09:35.908 --> 09:37.827
I am so happy.

09:40.830 --> 09:42.164
Hey, Phillip, think fast.

09:46.419 --> 09:48.421
- He is a Kanay,

09:48.504 --> 09:51.924
and no self-respecting witch
dates a Kanay.

09:52.008 --> 09:53.759
- You're just prejudiced!

09:53.843 --> 09:55.511
- I am not!
I--

09:55.594 --> 09:58.514
I am a mother who wants
what's best for her child.

09:58.597 --> 10:00.766
- And I'm just a girl
who wants to go to the play

10:00.850 --> 10:02.101
with her Proxy.

10:02.184 --> 10:03.311
- [gasps]

10:03.394 --> 10:05.396
You wouldn't.

10:05.479 --> 10:07.273
In front of the entire school?

10:07.356 --> 10:08.774
- Yes.

10:08.858 --> 10:11.736
And then we're gonna
have dinner together...

10:11.819 --> 10:12.611
in a restaurant...

10:12.695 --> 10:14.905

- Preppy?
Seriously?

10:22.496 --> 10:24.332

10:24.415 --> 10:27.376
- Andi like cargo pants better.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.503
- No like Phillip?

10:29.587 --> 10:30.546
- No.

10:30.629 --> 10:33.382
No, Andi thinks Phillip
is super cool...

10:33.466 --> 10:36.010
for an undead preppy guy.

10:38.262 --> 10:40.931
- It was really nice of you
not to send Phillip back.

10:41.015 --> 10:43.434
- Daniel left 'cause he thinks
it was a mistake.

10:43.517 --> 10:45.561
- [sighs]
It wasn't.

10:45.644 --> 10:47.938
- I just couldn't
send him back.

10:48.022 --> 10:50.733
Andi likes him,
like, for <i>real</i> real.

10:50.816 --> 10:53.736
And she's never
had a crush before, so...

10:53.819 --> 10:56.739
- Oh, come on,
you're the Chosen One!

10:56.822 --> 10:58.074
You can do whatever
you feel like,

10:58.157 --> 11:01.035
even make a zombie boyfriend
for your best friend.

11:01.118 --> 11:02.578
- Yeah!

11:02.661 --> 11:05.623
- So the Last Light
of the Fool Moon is coming up.

11:05.706 --> 11:06.791
- I know.

11:06.874 --> 11:08.250
I can't wait.

11:08.334 --> 11:09.251
- Maybe I can take you
on a date

11:09.335 --> 11:11.670
to celebrate us
getting through it?

11:11.754 --> 11:13.047
- I'd love that.

11:14.256 --> 11:15.549
- They say anything can happen

11:15.633 --> 11:17.134
on the Last Light
of the Fool Moon.

11:18.344 --> 11:20.930
We could go swimming
with dolphins.

11:21.013 --> 11:22.765
I could get my powers back.

11:22.848 --> 11:24.558
And we could destroy
the Magic Realm

11:24.642 --> 11:27.269
and be the last witch
and wizard alive.

11:27.353 --> 11:28.854
- What?
- Yes, just think about it.

11:28.938 --> 11:33.025
We could be the most
powerful beings on Earth.

11:33.109 --> 11:34.485
We could rule the world.

11:34.568 --> 11:36.946
- [laughing]

11:37.029 --> 11:38.447
You really had me going there.

11:38.531 --> 11:41.117
I thought you were serious.

11:41.200 --> 11:42.410
- [chuckles]

11:42.493 --> 11:43.619
Yeah, okay.

11:43.702 --> 11:45.496
I really got you there,
didn't I?

11:46.872 --> 11:49.208
- Hey, Diego,
my pizza order ready?

11:49.291 --> 11:50.459
- What pizza order?

11:50.543 --> 11:53.003
- The extra-large olive,
bacon, peanut butter pizza?

11:54.171 --> 11:55.423
- [sighs]
Yeah, sorry.

11:55.506 --> 11:58.134
I'm just slammed
with work here.

11:58.217 --> 11:59.260
I'll put it in right now.

11:59.343 --> 12:01.470
- It's okay.
I can wait.

12:01.554 --> 12:05.391
- Gigi's supposed to be working
today, but she's MIA...again.

12:05.474 --> 12:06.976
- Does she ditch out
on you a lot?

12:07.059 --> 12:09.812
- Not usually, but she's
been acting all weird.

12:09.895 --> 12:11.147
- Weird...how?

12:11.230 --> 12:13.858
- Like...

12:13.941 --> 12:14.733
being super secretive

12:14.817 --> 12:17.194
and running off
at random times

12:17.278 --> 12:19.071
to do things
she won't tell me about.

12:19.155 --> 12:20.781
- Diego...

12:22.116 --> 12:23.826
Does Gigi know about magic?

12:23.909 --> 12:25.119
- [scoffs]
Yeah. She hates it.

12:25.202 --> 12:27.496
- She does?

12:27.580 --> 12:29.039
- My parents hired a magician
for her eighth birthday.

12:29.123 --> 12:32.793
He did this really cool magic
trick--this coin magic trick--

12:32.877 --> 12:34.670
- Not that kind of magic.

12:34.753 --> 12:36.297
Real magic, like, you know,
me and Maddie?

12:36.380 --> 12:39.633
And you being a Kanay?

12:39.717 --> 12:40.843
- Oh, no, she doesn't.

12:43.888 --> 12:45.598
Well, at least
I've never told her.

12:45.681 --> 12:47.933
- The other day,
I teletransported

12:48.017 --> 12:50.519
into the janitor's closet,
and Gigi was there.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.521
But she wasn't surprised at all
that I appeared out of nowhere.

12:52.605 --> 12:53.355
- Oh, she was probably
just in the zone.

12:53.439 --> 12:55.983
- What's the zone?

12:56.066 --> 12:57.109
- It's when Gigi's putting
together all her blog posts

12:57.193 --> 12:59.528
and she tunes out
everything around her.

12:59.612 --> 13:00.863
The house could be on fire,

13:00.946 --> 13:02.198
and she literally
wouldn't even notice.

13:02.281 --> 13:03.449
- Got it, but...

13:03.532 --> 13:05.993
do you think someone else
might have told her?

13:06.076 --> 13:07.036
- Hmm, it's possible.

13:07.119 --> 13:08.621
Hey, if there's anything
I learned

13:08.704 --> 13:11.999
over the past couple years,
it's that anything's possible.

are you having an imaginary
conversation with Mr. Alonso...

again?

13:29.892 --> 13:31.101
- No.

13:31.185 --> 13:34.104
I am just laughing along
with you and your friend here.

13:34.188 --> 13:36.065
- Did you just call me
Maddie's friend?

13:36.148 --> 13:38.526
Not "the yucky Kanay"
or "the stinky Son of Fire"?

13:38.609 --> 13:40.569
- Yes, yes, I did.

13:40.653 --> 13:43.489
And now, uh, friend,
I need to have a conversation

13:43.572 --> 13:45.741
with my Maddie winky...

13:45.824 --> 13:46.784

a chocolate shake...

13:49.495 --> 13:50.538
please.

13:50.621 --> 13:51.872
- Okay.

13:53.541 --> 13:54.708
- [chuckles]

13:54.792 --> 13:57.503
Did you just say "please"?

13:57.586 --> 13:58.754
- Yes.

13:58.837 --> 14:00.631
It's something
I've been practicing.

14:00.714 --> 14:03.259
It's gracious bossing around.

14:03.342 --> 14:05.219
- Oh, this is just as I feared.

14:05.302 --> 14:07.304
That boy is
a terrible influence on you.

14:07.388 --> 14:11.976
- What happened to you being
all nice to us two seconds ago?

14:12.059 --> 14:14.728
- That was just me using honey
to lure you into my trap.

14:14.812 --> 14:18.107

That's my thing!

14:18.190 --> 14:19.441
- Well, the apple doesn't fall
far from the tree, does it?

14:19.525 --> 14:22.945
And as your...tree,

14:23.028 --> 14:25.030
I am ordering you, Maddie,

14:25.114 --> 14:27.074
you cannot see that boy again.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.082
- We got the same schedule.

14:35.165 --> 14:35.916
Sweet!

14:37.167 --> 14:38.502
- Sweet!
