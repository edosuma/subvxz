00:46.950 --> 00:50.617
So this is the part where we say goodbye

00:52.992 --> 00:56.950
I promise I'll try to make it
stick this time

00:58.617 --> 01:03.658
I always love breaking up
with you 'cause

01:03.783 --> 01:09.325
The more bitter it got, the better
the making up with you was

01:09.533 --> 01:15.408
And I think we can agree on
the following things

01:16.617 --> 01:21.242
I'm an asshole and you're kinda needy

01:21.867 --> 01:24.658
I said it was casual

01:25.117 --> 01:28.242
And you pretended to believe me

01:28.617 --> 01:31.350
Our glass is empty

01:31.450 --> 01:35.533
At our best it was only half full

01:36.742 --> 01:39.617
I only love you when you're leaving

01:41.783 --> 01:45.075
And I'm an asshole

01:52.492 --> 01:54.450
- Mary Beth?
- Yeah?

01:56.450 --> 01:57.950
Hold on.

01:58.866 --> 02:00.433
- Can you do a dinner run?
- Sure.

02:00.533 --> 02:02.058
- You know what time it is?
- Sandwiches?

02:02.158 --> 02:05.141
- How long we going to do this?
- We're going to do it until it's right.

02:05.241 --> 02:07.075
Gotta call my wife.

02:07.616 --> 02:12.533
Stuck in your confines

02:13.116 --> 02:15.950
Chewin' it over

02:18.700 --> 02:23.075
Caught in your headlights

02:24.408 --> 02:26.783
Stop staring...

02:28.075 --> 02:30.075
Hey, you seen Stiles?

02:32.950 --> 02:35.575
Nah? I guess it's no.

02:43.741 --> 02:45.683
...employees. Not in billing.
Not in awards even.

02:45.783 --> 02:47.933
We're right back here.

02:48.033 --> 02:50.100
I think everyone knows everyone.

02:50.200 --> 02:51.475
- Hi, Carl.
- Brent.

02:51.575 --> 02:52.683
- Good to see you again.
- Good to see you, Keri.

02:52.783 --> 02:53.725
Thank you so much for coming.

02:53.825 --> 02:55.908
- If you wouldn't mind sitting right here?
- Sure.

02:58.575 --> 03:00.016
You have a presentation pack
in front of you

03:00.116 --> 03:02.408
if you want to get a sneak peek at...

03:02.616 --> 03:05.766
I guess what I'm trying to say, Carl,
is that the other four agencies

03:05.866 --> 03:09.516
are probably laughing at the fact
that we're even in the running

03:09.616 --> 03:11.491
for your business.

03:14.075 --> 03:16.075
We're not laughing.

03:17.825 --> 03:19.641
- Hey, Dad.
- Where are you?

03:19.741 --> 03:20.975
I'm at the library.

03:21.075 --> 03:23.016
- Meet me at the Belle.
- No, I got class.

03:23.116 --> 03:24.475
Cut it.

03:24.575 --> 03:26.600
Weren't you supposed to be riding me
about going to class?

03:26.700 --> 03:31.183
Hey, I'm payin' for it. I say cut it,
all right? Get somebody else's notes.

03:31.283 --> 03:32.766
Your old man just
knocked one out of the park,

03:32.866 --> 03:34.991
and I wanna celebrate with you.

03:35.491 --> 03:36.725
Whatever happened to free choice?

03:36.825 --> 03:37.891
No, that's a myth.

03:37.991 --> 03:40.950
Come on, I'm already in the car.
I'll meet you in half an hour.

04:09.075 --> 04:11.241
Hey, it's Josh, leave a message.

04:11.783 --> 04:15.991
Yup, it's me again.
Not cool blowin' off your dad.

04:16.241 --> 04:18.766
All right, well,
call me over the weekend.

04:18.866 --> 04:20.366
Bye.

04:41.033 --> 04:43.950
Hey, can I...
Can I get some volume on this?

04:47.075 --> 04:50.658
Hey, excuse me! Can I get some sound?
Can you turn this up, please?

05:28.949 --> 05:31.141
A tragedy of this magnitude...
Absolutely heartbreaking.

05:31.241 --> 05:34.349
And the fact that it happened
in our own backyard, unbelievable.

05:34.449 --> 05:36.433
We have Lisa Martin on the scene.
And, Lisa...

05:36.533 --> 05:38.933
- Anything?
- No.

05:39.033 --> 05:41.183
The parents of Sarah Clark,
an Honor Roll student...

05:41.283 --> 05:44.433
Well, all you can do
is be there for him.

05:44.533 --> 05:47.516
...just passed behind me,
obviously distraught.

05:47.616 --> 05:49.891
Family members tell me that
ever since she was a little girl,

05:49.991 --> 05:52.408
Sarah had dreamed of becoming a nurse.

06:18.366 --> 06:20.616
- ...quite a bit.
- Yeah.

06:21.241 --> 06:23.616
They were young, that's what counts.

06:29.074 --> 06:31.324
You be strong.

06:33.949 --> 06:35.699
Thank you for coming.

06:35.908 --> 06:37.991
I'd have walked if I had to.

06:48.574 --> 06:49.933
I'm going to be so worried about you.

06:50.033 --> 06:52.766
Brent and I want you to know that
we are here for you.

06:52.866 --> 06:54.766
You have got to let go of this, honey.

06:54.866 --> 06:56.266
Just cry.

06:56.366 --> 07:00.324
You're just being too strong
Give me a call, sweetie, okay?

07:47.574 --> 07:49.116
Oh, God.

08:20.491 --> 08:21.849
I'm sorry.

08:21.949 --> 08:23.824
Ms. Tamburg said I could come up.

08:25.949 --> 08:27.574
I'm Kate.

08:28.324 --> 08:30.283
I was Josh's...

08:30.866 --> 08:32.573
Sod of, we dated.

08:33.033 --> 08:34.783
For about a year.

08:38.116 --> 08:39.823
That's me.

08:42.658 --> 08:44.283
You're his dad, right?

08:45.658 --> 08:47.116
You're Sam.

08:50.033 --> 08:51.949
He spoke about you.

08:53.449 --> 08:55.032
Highly of you.

08:58.199 --> 09:00.157
He was really sweet to me.

09:03.824 --> 09:05.741
He was always very sweet to me.

09:07.991 --> 09:09.099
Honey.

09:09.199 --> 09:10.991
I'm sorry.

09:11.282 --> 09:13.991
- I'm so sorry.
- I know, honey.

09:14.907 --> 09:17.432
I just don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

09:17.532 --> 09:19.116
I know.

09:22.282 --> 09:23.391
Okay! It's him.

09:23.491 --> 09:25.324
We got him.

09:25.616 --> 09:27.449
All right, let's rock and roll.

09:27.616 --> 09:29.557
Okay, lemme get a three-quarter shot.

09:29.657 --> 09:31.324
Good, good, good.

09:32.407 --> 09:34.324
Catch him out of the car.
Catch him out of the car.

09:38.324 --> 09:40.682
Mr. Manning! Have you spoken to any of
the other parents?

09:40.782 --> 09:43.449
Has anybody been in contact with you?

09:43.699 --> 09:45.724
Mr. Manning, how was the funeral?

09:45.824 --> 09:48.432
Just a statement. Mr. Manning!

09:48.532 --> 09:50.699
Mr. Manning! Please, just one second.

09:51.449 --> 09:53.657
Mr. Manning, how is your ex-wife?

11:09.157 --> 11:10.824
Fuck!

11:39.157 --> 11:40.699
Oh, shit.

11:45.782 --> 11:48.407
Hey, excuse me.
Do you have a back way out?

11:49.241 --> 11:51.099
Yeah... An exit?

11:51.199 --> 11:53.157
You do? Oh, never mind.

11:54.324 --> 11:55.991
Just keep it.

11:59.157 --> 12:00.182
Mr. Manning?

12:00.282 --> 12:01.557
Mr. Manning! I hate to bother you.

12:01.657 --> 12:04.307
Oh, yeah? Well, if you hated it so much,
you wouldn't be doin' it, would you?

12:04.407 --> 12:06.682
Do you feel that the school bears any
responsibility for...

12:06.782 --> 12:08.449
You know, lemme ask you
a question first.

12:08.782 --> 12:11.282
You're a headless,
bottom-feeding motherfucker.

12:12.032 --> 12:13.866
Well, I guess it's not
really a question, is it?

12:47.365 --> 12:50.182
- Sam.
- Hey. I'm fine. I'm okay. I'm serious.

12:50.282 --> 12:52.199
Hey, hey, hey.

12:56.990 --> 12:58.682
- Sam!
- Does that seem like I'm not okay?

12:58.782 --> 13:00.890
You shouldn't be here, okay?
You should probably go home.

13:00.990 --> 13:03.390
Hey, hey. Wanna come inside?
Check how fine I really am.

13:03.490 --> 13:05.032
Sam!

13:05.449 --> 13:07.907
How nice to see you, too!

13:10.074 --> 13:12.532
She can't keep her hands off me.

13:17.115 --> 13:19.099
- Professional help.
- Yes, yes, yes.

13:19.199 --> 13:20.599
How many times did you go see him?

13:20.699 --> 13:22.849
Well, I mean,
I didn't actually see the guy yet, but...

13:22.949 --> 13:27.365
I didn't see him, but I did talk to him
on the phone, and... Nice guy.

13:28.240 --> 13:29.765
Listen.

13:29.865 --> 13:31.490
We're doing fine here.

13:32.199 --> 13:34.432
Take the time that you need to...

13:34.532 --> 13:36.240
Hey, hey.

13:36.365 --> 13:42.724
I appreciate that concern. I really do.
But what I need is to work.

13:42.824 --> 13:46.099
What I need is to come in here every day
and I'm gonna sell some tacos.

13:46.199 --> 13:51.240
Okay? I gotta write some catchy copy
and I gotta put on a suit, tie and smile.

13:52.032 --> 13:53.349
Face the future.

13:53.449 --> 13:54.990
That...

13:57.365 --> 13:59.574
That's what I need.

14:54.990 --> 14:57.182
Sam, I need to talk to you.

14:57.282 --> 14:59.182
Late for work. Catch me tonight.

14:59.282 --> 15:00.515
No, this is important.

15:00.615 --> 15:02.224
Late for work, doin'.

15:02.324 --> 15:05.015
No, this is important! I implore you.

15:05.115 --> 15:06.907
We can walk and talk.

15:33.615 --> 15:37.182
Was beginning to wonder if you needed a
written invitation to come to work today.

15:37.282 --> 15:39.990
No invitation necessary.

15:40.157 --> 15:43.949
Days with these fine gentlemen
is what I get out of bed for.

15:45.157 --> 15:46.807
Don't be late again.

15:46.907 --> 15:48.574
You know what I'm sayin'?

15:49.324 --> 15:50.990
Don't be late again.

15:55.657 --> 15:57.948
Yeah, you wouldn't wanna
lose this job, huh?

16:01.448 --> 16:03.432
You wanna get a beer after work?

16:03.532 --> 16:06.573
Me and Carlos are gonna go over
to Trill to get some.

16:06.865 --> 16:08.740
I don't drink.

16:09.448 --> 16:13.740
You best check your cologne,
because you smell like you drink.

16:26.073 --> 16:27.573
Evenin'.

16:33.073 --> 16:35.515
Don't call me whore in the morning

16:35.615 --> 16:37.807
Don't call me baby when you want me
in your bed

16:37.907 --> 16:40.307
Then you leave me
at 4:00 in the morning

16:40.407 --> 16:42.473
I should have kicked you
in the balls instead

16:42.573 --> 16:44.598
Then you tell me that you're sorry

16:44.698 --> 16:49.182
And that the girl that I saw you at
the Walmart with wasn't anybody...

16:49.282 --> 16:50.932
Hey, man, I didn't think
you were gonna make it.

16:51.032 --> 16:53.015
Yeah, what you drinkin'?

16:53.115 --> 16:55.682
I'm gonna get a Mustang Wheat.
No lemon.

16:55.782 --> 16:56.890
Wheat?

16:56.990 --> 16:59.640
But I talked to your cousin
and she told me that that girl is a whore

16:59.740 --> 17:04.573
You're a whore!
She's the whore! She's the whore!

17:05.406 --> 17:07.515
Don't call me whore in the morning

17:07.615 --> 17:08.932
Don't call me baby when you want me...

17:09.031 --> 17:11.182
So what's your story anyway, man?

17:11.281 --> 17:12.348
I mean,

17:12.448 --> 17:16.865
why you paintin' houses? And don't
give me that shit about NASA again.

17:16.990 --> 17:18.781
All right, promise you won't tell?

17:20.156 --> 17:22.723
I'm in the witness protection program.

17:22.823 --> 17:24.906
I fingered Gotti.

17:26.365 --> 17:28.448
Fine. Don't tell me.

17:29.448 --> 17:31.657
I don't give a shit. Dick.

17:32.573 --> 17:34.348
As a reminder not to date assholes

17:34.448 --> 17:36.682
And throw my life away
I'm not the whore!

17:36.782 --> 17:39.657
You're the whore! You're the whore!

17:41.865 --> 17:43.307
Thank you.

17:43.407 --> 17:48.515
Okay! That was... That was Peaches.

17:48.615 --> 17:50.015
Thank you, Peaches.

17:50.115 --> 17:54.907
Next we have Nic Harvard.
Nic! Come on up!

18:03.782 --> 18:07.115
It was a long, long time ago
and far, far away

18:07.490 --> 18:11.432
I guess you could say it was
like every other day

18:11.532 --> 18:15.282
Found myself on broken streets
wanderin' around

18:15.490 --> 18:19.448
Lookin' for a place
that I can lay my troubles down

18:27.948 --> 18:29.657
Hey, stranger.

18:32.782 --> 18:35.182
You're not really gonna
stroll up acting like

18:35.282 --> 18:37.098
we're running into
one another at the mall?

18:37.198 --> 18:39.432
This is gonna be one of those
moments where no matter what I say,

18:39.532 --> 18:41.057
it's wrong, isn't it?

18:41.157 --> 18:42.640
Tell me, Sam, how should I be acting?

18:42.740 --> 18:46.015
What is the appropriate tone
for having to track down

18:46.115 --> 18:49.473
your ex-husband who's hiding out
two and a half hours away on a boat?

18:49.573 --> 18:51.198
I'm not hiding.

18:52.532 --> 18:55.490
- You're not hiding?
- What do you want, Em?

18:56.032 --> 18:58.865
Your signature.
I'm putting the house on the market.

18:59.032 --> 19:02.532
And I'm here. And I'm tired.
And I have a long drive ahead of me.

19:02.657 --> 19:04.532
Could've forged it.

19:05.657 --> 19:07.348
You're right, I could've.

19:07.448 --> 19:09.057
Maybe I was worried about you.

19:09.157 --> 19:10.432
- Should I be worried?
- I'm fine.

19:10.532 --> 19:13.032
Come on, I'm livin' the dream.
On a boat.

19:17.615 --> 19:21.323
It's marked everywhere
I need a signature.

19:28.656 --> 19:29.848
His name's Phillip.

19:29.948 --> 19:32.823
Wow. Okay. Yeah.

19:34.615 --> 19:36.490
He's 11 months old.

19:36.990 --> 19:39.448
That's fantastic.

19:39.615 --> 19:41.515
He is a miracle.

19:41.615 --> 19:44.348
A $200,000 miracle,

19:44.448 --> 19:49.740
but he is a beautiful, healthy boy.

19:53.948 --> 19:55.973
We're moving to Tulsa.

19:56.073 --> 19:58.031
Tom's dad isn't doing so well.

19:59.656 --> 20:01.365
That's great.

20:01.490 --> 20:02.515
I mean, I'm sorry.

20:02.615 --> 20:05.390
And I finally decided
to let go of a few things.

20:05.490 --> 20:07.723
I saved this for you.
Music was always you guys' thing.

20:07.823 --> 20:09.848
I couldn't even open the boxes.

20:09.948 --> 20:12.031
Hold on, I don't have room for that.

20:12.323 --> 20:14.681
- What do you mean?
- Like, the boat. It's not big enough.

20:14.781 --> 20:15.806
- Sorry.
- You can't be serious.

20:15.906 --> 20:17.531
What do want me to say?

20:18.781 --> 20:22.365
I don't know. It took me over two years
to get to a point where I can

20:22.615 --> 20:26.181
clean out his room, and you,
you don't care about his stuff?

20:26.281 --> 20:27.765
- That's not fair.
- Isn't it?

20:27.865 --> 20:29.723
Well, get pissed! It's not going to make
my boat any bigger.

20:29.823 --> 20:31.490
No! No!

20:31.948 --> 20:35.973
If you wanna act
like Josh never existed,

20:36.073 --> 20:38.598
if hiding makes it
easier for you, great.

20:38.698 --> 20:41.698
But make no mistake, you are hiding!

21:52.031 --> 21:57.306
Darkness, don't give way to the light
I wish I may, I wish I might

21:57.406 --> 22:02.140
Stay with you, with you

22:02.240 --> 22:06.365
We'll shine so bright

22:06.656 --> 22:10.181
Just raise your glasses
and drink one to the night

22:10.281 --> 22:11.740
It's so...

22:36.906 --> 22:42.656
Well, I'm tryin' to get home
But it feels like another life

22:42.781 --> 22:46.015
Yeah, I'm tryin' to be strong

22:46.115 --> 22:51.698
Sometimes I realize
That the further I go

22:52.531 --> 22:57.989
The more that I know
That I wanna go home

23:01.406 --> 23:06.848
Well, I'm packin' my bags
Another day and another town

23:06.948 --> 23:13.239
What a fool I am
Can't seem to settle down

23:13.489 --> 23:19.364
Cause the further I go
The more that I know

23:19.864 --> 23:23.489
That I wanna go home

23:24.948 --> 23:31.139
And the further I go...
The further I... The further I go

23:31.239 --> 23:36.739
The more that I know
That I wanna go home

23:49.406 --> 23:51.781
Hey, what do you say there, Alard?

23:52.198 --> 23:53.264
It's Alaird.

23:53.364 --> 23:56.556
These are the kind of days
worth working for, huh?

23:56.656 --> 23:59.364
- I just wanna be forthright and honest.
- Oh, good.

23:59.489 --> 24:03.556
I had to file another complaint about
you relieving yourself in the lake.

24:03.656 --> 24:06.406
- The rules are quite clear.
- Alard,

24:06.823 --> 24:10.698
do you realize how many of our
conversations are about my penis?

24:11.614 --> 24:13.681
You're not nearly as funny
as you think you are.

24:13.781 --> 24:16.614
This is a family lake.
You've been warned.

24:34.781 --> 24:39.073
Don't say a word about your plans

24:41.031 --> 24:46.239
Maybe I don't give a damn

24:47.614 --> 24:52.156
Don't say a word about your plans...

24:53.573 --> 24:56.098
You here to play? Just you?

24:56.198 --> 24:57.864
Sign-up's right there.

25:09.156 --> 25:11.114
Can I get a Mustang Wheat?

25:11.281 --> 25:12.473
Brian, that was terrific.

25:12.573 --> 25:15.764
I hate to say this.
I love it when women break your heart,

25:15.864 --> 25:18.389
because you write
beautiful love songs about 'em.

25:18.489 --> 25:20.323
Give it up for Brian.

25:23.864 --> 25:25.406
No lemon.

25:33.073 --> 25:40.406
Maybe I... I should stay
I'm better off your way

25:41.489 --> 25:45.448
But I'm not givin' up

25:51.698 --> 25:53.389
Show your faith

25:53.489 --> 25:57.448
You got a lot of nerve
To come around here

26:03.614 --> 26:05.614
That was fantastic.

26:05.781 --> 26:08.223
Tolly and Tina, everybody.

26:08.323 --> 26:11.823
Next we have...

26:12.073 --> 26:14.198
Alard Dick.

26:17.031 --> 26:20.948
- Tolly, that was really nice.
- Thanks.

26:52.156 --> 26:55.181
Well, I'm trying to get home

26:55.281 --> 26:58.139
But it feels like another life

26:58.239 --> 27:01.347
Yeah, I'm trying to stay strong

27:01.447 --> 27:04.306
And sometimes I realize

27:04.406 --> 27:07.847
That the further I go

27:07.947 --> 27:10.472
The more that I know

27:10.572 --> 27:14.531
That I wanna go home

27:16.614 --> 27:19.681
Well, I'm packin' my bags

27:19.781 --> 27:22.764
Another day and another town

27:22.864 --> 27:25.931
What a fool I am

27:26.031 --> 27:28.556
Can't seem to settle down

27:28.656 --> 27:32.514
'Cause the further I go

27:32.614 --> 27:35.181
The more that I know

27:35.281 --> 27:38.989
That I wanna go home

27:41.531 --> 27:44.156
You can't take that outside.

27:50.197 --> 27:52.781
Excuse me? Excuse me.

27:53.614 --> 27:55.097
That was awesome.

27:55.197 --> 27:58.972
And when I say awesome, I mean
"hairs on my neck stand up" awesome.

27:59.072 --> 28:03.031
I wanted to say something to you earlier,
but you look scary.

28:04.822 --> 28:07.431
- I'm glad that you liked it.
- Oh, yeah. I'm not blowing smoke.

28:07.531 --> 28:11.906
That song had something going on.
Something deep.

28:12.447 --> 28:14.197
I'm Quentin.

28:14.739 --> 28:16.306
Well, good to meet you, Quentin.

28:16.406 --> 28:18.681
Don't let the brain dead back there
get to you.

28:18.781 --> 28:23.222
I mean, they... I'm here every week
and they wouldn't know greatness if it...

28:23.322 --> 28:26.656
They just wouldn't know it.
They wouldn't know it.

28:27.614 --> 28:34.031
I don't mean to be rude,
but you're quite drunk, Mr. Dick.

28:36.322 --> 28:38.447
Do you want me to give you a ride?

28:51.406 --> 28:54.239
Oh, crap. Crap.

28:55.406 --> 28:56.906
Hey!

29:16.656 --> 29:20.614
- So you gonna come back and play?
- Thank you for the ride.

29:36.447 --> 29:38.197
Knock, knock.

29:40.906 --> 29:42.906
Hello.

29:47.156 --> 29:49.031
Hello?

29:51.447 --> 29:54.222
- Hello!
- For fuck's sake.

29:54.322 --> 29:57.555
You're supposed to be invited on board.

29:57.655 --> 30:00.864
- Sorry, sorry.
- Stop. Come back.

30:10.989 --> 30:13.639
- Is that for me?
- Yeah.

30:13.739 --> 30:15.722
I thought you might like a donut.
Buck's Space Age.

30:15.822 --> 30:20.239
They're like edible heaven.
Good, as in I'd have one over sex.

30:20.447 --> 30:22.530
Well, you're doing it wrong, then.

30:31.322 --> 30:34.697
So is this even legal?

30:36.447 --> 30:40.014
Not that. That is not even sanitary.

30:40.114 --> 30:41.805
I mean, living on a...

30:41.905 --> 30:43.055
You're here to
give me a ticket, Quentin?

30:43.155 --> 30:48.405
No. No, no, no. And I'm not like your
newest stalker or anything. I just...

30:48.780 --> 30:50.555
I just can't get that song
out of my head.

30:50.655 --> 30:53.889
'Round and 'round and around
and I'm laying there and I think,

30:53.989 --> 30:55.805
"What it needs is a harmony."

30:55.905 --> 30:58.139
Nothing over the top. Just simple.

30:58.239 --> 31:01.972
And then I think, "if that song is
that good, there have to be others."

31:02.072 --> 31:05.014
And if there are others,
someone ought to play them.

31:05.114 --> 31:07.447
- We could play them.
- Let me stop you right there.

31:08.780 --> 31:10.847
I'm not interested.

31:10.947 --> 31:14.905
Sure, no. Right. Totally,
I get ahead of myself sometimes.

31:15.614 --> 31:19.155
- Are there other songs?
- Thank you for the coffee.

31:19.614 --> 31:21.239
Sure.

31:25.114 --> 31:28.430
Just to clarify, you don't want to play
at the Trill again,

31:28.530 --> 31:30.822
or you don't want to play with me?

31:31.280 --> 31:33.405
Thank you for the coffee.

31:34.030 --> 31:35.947
Yeah, yeah.

31:55.447 --> 31:58.180
You're my sidekick

31:58.280 --> 32:00.389
You're my alibi

32:00.489 --> 32:04.155
You're my right-hand man

32:05.780 --> 32:08.764
I'm your homeboy

32:08.864 --> 32:11.514
I'm your main dude

32:11.614 --> 32:15.572
I'm your best laid plan

32:16.905 --> 32:21.180
When the shit hits the fan

32:21.280 --> 32:25.280
Could I make you understand?

32:26.155 --> 32:30.055
I don't know

32:30.155 --> 32:32.680
Wife kick you out?

32:32.780 --> 32:36.222
- Excuse me?
- You're here every week for a shower.

32:36.322 --> 32:39.014
- Wife pissed at you?
- No.

32:39.114 --> 32:42.305
Nope. No wife, no kids.

32:42.405 --> 32:47.864
Live on a boat. Sexy for everything
except for taking a shower.

32:55.905 --> 32:57.905
Mr. Dick?

32:58.030 --> 33:01.989
Sorry, sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.
It's Quentin, in case you forgot.

33:03.072 --> 33:05.822
I have to put a bell around your neck.

33:06.655 --> 33:10.822
I missed you the other night.
Kinda held out hope.

33:15.405 --> 33:18.514
You know, I don't get the appeal
of fishing.

33:18.614 --> 33:22.305
Really. Well, I would imagine that
most activities performed in silence

33:22.405 --> 33:24.447
don't make much sense to you.

33:27.405 --> 33:29.738
Permission to come aboard?

33:32.655 --> 33:36.055
If I say yes,
you promise to help with dinner?

33:36.155 --> 33:39.113
- Done.
- All right. Here, clean these.

33:52.488 --> 33:55.513
Mr. Dick, I don't know if I can do this.

33:55.613 --> 33:57.847
Don't call me Mr. Dick.

33:57.947 --> 34:00.055
- Okay, Alard.
- Don't call me Alard either.

34:00.155 --> 34:02.597
Well, if I need to talk to you,
should I just whistle?

34:02.697 --> 34:05.388
- Call me Sam.
- Okay, why not?

34:05.488 --> 34:07.697
Think you can handle that?

34:25.112 --> 34:28.554
You never told me if you've written
others, but I'm guessing you have because

34:28.655 --> 34:31.013
it doesn't really sound like a first try
kind of tune.

34:31.112 --> 34:32.597
Back to this?

34:32.697 --> 34:35.347
What I don't understand is
you don't write stuff like this

34:35.447 --> 34:37.780
if you don't want people to hear it.

34:42.280 --> 34:47.013
I don't know where the days have gone

34:47.112 --> 34:51.222
But I know I wanna go home

34:51.322 --> 34:55.697
No, it's not...
"But I know where I belong."

34:56.447 --> 35:00.347
I know where I belong

35:00.447 --> 35:01.847
- Right?
- Yeah.

35:01.947 --> 35:03.680
I want to go...

35:03.780 --> 35:06.347
Do that pad, do the last pad again.

35:06.447 --> 35:10.613
I don't know where the days have gone

35:10.738 --> 35:16.488
But I know where I belong

35:16.863 --> 35:20.822
I wanna go home

35:27.447 --> 35:31.405
Fuck! Wait, go back to the pad.
No, no, no, the...

35:31.613 --> 35:36.805
Would you still be my friend
if I broke into your house

35:36.905 --> 35:40.888
Pissed in your shoes
And relieved you of your eyebrows?

35:40.988 --> 35:42.013
Do that, I like that.

35:42.113 --> 35:44.597
I'd still be friends with you

35:44.697 --> 35:47.155
What don't you understand about,
"Do that"?

35:47.363 --> 35:50.488
'Cause that's what real friends do

35:50.655 --> 35:53.722
- Anyway, thank you.
- Yeah, thank you for coming by.

35:53.822 --> 35:56.013
- Those were good jams.
- That was okay.

35:56.113 --> 35:58.555
- No, really good jams.
- Yeah.

35:58.655 --> 36:01.488
- Yeah, it was pretty great.
- Okay.

36:03.113 --> 36:04.988
- All right.
- Okay.

36:11.155 --> 36:14.097
You seriously have no desire
to go out and play those?

36:14.197 --> 36:15.972
- Good night, Quentin.
- Just hold on. Hold on.

36:16.072 --> 36:20.555
You heard us, right? You can't tell me
that didn't dial you up just a little bit.

36:20.655 --> 36:23.430
- It was nice, okay?
- Nice?

36:23.530 --> 36:27.488
Are you kidding...
Hold on, hold on. Nice?

36:27.738 --> 36:30.430
That was not just nice, okay?

36:30.530 --> 36:33.322
I've played with people before,
and it's always sucked.

36:33.447 --> 36:36.488
It's always sucked because most things,
they suck!

36:36.613 --> 36:38.805
That wasn't just nice, okay?

36:38.905 --> 36:41.847
Are you... I bet that was even better
than you imagined...

36:41.947 --> 36:44.447
Fine, I'll play the song.

36:45.155 --> 36:46.180
Really?

36:46.280 --> 36:48.097
If it'll get you to go home right now.

36:48.197 --> 36:52.905
I'm gone. I'm out. I'm home.
You're not messing with me, right?

36:53.030 --> 36:56.471
You're not messing with me, right?
We're going to rehearse and we'll play?

36:56.571 --> 36:58.071
You're still here.

36:59.113 --> 37:01.571
I'm out, I'm out. I'm gone.

37:05.196 --> 37:08.363
Hey, your name really is Sam, right?

37:12.446 --> 37:15.196
Be by you, be by you

37:15.321 --> 37:17.888
All I want is to be by you

37:17.988 --> 37:20.596
Be by you, be by you

37:20.696 --> 37:23.263
All I want is to be by you

37:23.363 --> 37:26.280
Be by you, be by you

37:27.155 --> 37:28.905
Hey, you must be Sam.

37:29.030 --> 37:31.738
I won't tell you how Quentin
told me to recognize you.

37:31.863 --> 37:33.596
Well, I can only guess.

37:33.696 --> 37:35.030
Aiken, this is Tolly.

37:35.155 --> 37:36.780
We met, but you were really drunk.

37:36.905 --> 37:39.530
Nice to meet you, again.

37:40.196 --> 37:42.321
You know where I can find him?

37:42.780 --> 37:45.071
Bathroom. Think he's a little nervous.

37:45.196 --> 37:46.988
He does this.

37:49.571 --> 37:52.155
Can you watch this?

38:02.530 --> 38:05.196
- You okay in there?
- Great.

38:05.321 --> 38:07.780
Great. Almost done.

38:09.655 --> 38:12.738
In case you forgot, you know,
this was your idea.

38:12.863 --> 38:15.196
Yeah, I know. Weird, right?

38:18.655 --> 38:20.013
Quentin.

38:20.113 --> 38:24.946
There are 14 people in the audience.
And 10 of them are performers.

38:29.155 --> 38:30.613
You launching the space shuttle?

38:30.738 --> 38:33.321
I worked a little something up.
Trust me.

38:33.446 --> 38:34.905
Just don't throw up.

38:35.030 --> 38:38.821
That's helpful. You're helpful.
So, so helpful.

38:49.321 --> 38:53.721
You're my sidekick You're my alibi

38:53.821 --> 38:56.780
You're my right-hand man

38:57.946 --> 39:02.321
I'm your homeboy I'm your main dude

39:02.446 --> 39:05.863
I'm your best laid plan

39:06.405 --> 39:10.013
When the shit hits the fan

39:10.113 --> 39:13.846
Could I make you understand?

39:13.946 --> 39:18.305
I don't know

39:18.405 --> 39:22.780
Would you still be my friend
if I made outwith your mother?

39:22.905 --> 39:27.155
Would you still be my friend
if I beat up your brother?

39:27.280 --> 39:30.988
Could I still be friends with you?

39:32.155 --> 39:35.071
'Cause that's what real friends do

39:43.363 --> 39:47.321
You're my defense You're my samurai

39:47.446 --> 39:51.405
You're the man, you're the man

39:51.655 --> 39:56.013
There's no secrets
There's no need to lie

39:56.113 --> 39:59.613
Words are not enough to best describe us

39:59.738 --> 40:03.596
But when the shit hits the fan

40:03.696 --> 40:07.430
Could I make you understand?

40:07.530 --> 40:12.363
I don't know

40:19.738 --> 40:21.596
You seriously never been here?

40:21.696 --> 40:24.613
Oh, man. You are in for a treat.

40:25.988 --> 40:27.154
You taking care of my baby?

40:27.279 --> 40:28.779
I'd be years into my retirement

40:28.904 --> 40:30.846
before you got enough money to
take it home, son.

40:30.946 --> 40:33.488
You're sunny personality is what
keep's me coming back, Del.

40:33.613 --> 40:36.029
Well, I guess I ought to be
nicer to you then.

40:36.154 --> 40:38.571
I think that's the nicest
he's ever been to me.

40:38.696 --> 40:40.238
Seriously.

40:40.946 --> 40:44.154
Does it get any prettier than that?

40:44.321 --> 40:45.946
Expensive taste.

40:46.321 --> 40:50.013
'78 Gibson Les Paul.
Rosewood solid body.

40:50.113 --> 40:56.904
Gold-plated humbucker pickups.
Pearl inlays. Pure perfection.

40:57.029 --> 40:59.071
You stock Dean Markley Blue Steels?

40:59.738 --> 41:01.363
I do.

41:01.613 --> 41:03.529
Get three packs?

41:04.779 --> 41:06.821
Hope you're not in a hurry.

41:08.113 --> 41:10.321
I take it he's in here a lot.

41:10.446 --> 41:14.738
I've figured I've made a dime for
every hour he's spent in here. $18.95.

41:16.488 --> 41:19.238
You goin' somewhere there?
Got yourself a motor home?

41:19.363 --> 41:21.654
That is my missus' dream.

41:21.779 --> 41:23.446
She says it'll be romantic.

41:23.571 --> 41:25.154
Sounds more to me like getting
your prostate kicked

41:25.279 --> 41:26.863
for eight hours a day until you're dead.

41:26.988 --> 41:28.654
So you're looking forward to it?

41:30.196 --> 41:31.946
Can't hardly wait.

41:37.863 --> 41:38.904
Willie!

41:39.029 --> 41:40.071
I thought that was your truck!

41:40.196 --> 41:44.429
- Hey!
- Quite right, that is my truck. It is.

41:44.529 --> 41:46.013
So what's new with you?

41:46.113 --> 41:47.321
Not much.

41:47.446 --> 41:49.946
Not much. What about you? Are you still
playing with those guys in Edmond?

41:50.071 --> 41:52.154
Not for a few months, man.

41:52.279 --> 41:55.154
Been so long since I played with
anyone else, I can hardly remember.

41:55.279 --> 41:57.363
Are you kidding me? You?

41:57.488 --> 41:59.363
You're, like, the best bass player
I've ever heard!

41:59.488 --> 42:00.988
Yeah, well...

42:01.196 --> 42:02.488
Seriously, man, don't worry.

42:02.613 --> 42:06.071
Some band is gonna snatch you up.
You're a magician!

42:07.779 --> 42:09.279
So...

42:13.738 --> 42:17.446
- Well, it was good to see you!
- Yeah, great! See you, guys!

42:26.863 --> 42:27.904
What?

42:28.029 --> 42:29.821
I don't know if I should be impressed
by the effort

42:29.946 --> 42:32.654
or insulted that you think
you can pull that off.

42:32.779 --> 42:34.488
I don't know what you're talking about.

42:35.988 --> 42:37.696
Okay.

42:44.988 --> 42:46.113
All right, fine.

42:46.238 --> 42:50.738
Willie plays bass and I think a bass
would really bring the songs to life.

42:50.863 --> 42:52.321
I'm too old to start a band.

42:52.446 --> 42:55.863
Start a band? No. I don't...
We're not...

42:55.988 --> 43:02.654
I don't wanna start a band. I just think a
little bass would make us sound better.

43:06.446 --> 43:08.404
- Can we go?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

43:33.821 --> 43:36.154
Voila. Not bad, huh?

43:36.279 --> 43:38.488
You could even park a car in here.

43:46.863 --> 43:48.696
You like the Lips?

43:49.696 --> 43:52.487
Yeah, I like the poster.
Where... Is this your parents' place?

43:52.612 --> 43:58.196
No, no. Ruth... I'm sort of the caretaker.
My apartment's upstairs.

43:58.321 --> 43:59.862
You from around here?

43:59.987 --> 44:03.112
No, not... Not really.

44:03.487 --> 44:04.487
Do you want a drink?

44:04.612 --> 44:06.529
Well, where you from?
What do your folks do?

44:06.946 --> 44:08.737
It's complicated.

44:08.862 --> 44:13.904
Let me see what I got.
Got water and more water.

44:14.029 --> 44:15.029
Pretty much water.

44:15.154 --> 44:19.321
Dude! You killed it, man!
Can you give me a hand?

44:19.571 --> 44:22.154
- Hey, did you get the chords and lyrics?
- Yeah, I got 'em.

44:22.612 --> 44:24.071
'Sup Sam! Good to see you again.

44:24.196 --> 44:26.821
- Yep. Hi, Willie.
- Let me get that piece.

44:26.946 --> 44:28.987
How do you come up with this shit?

44:29.112 --> 44:31.196
Oh, they just come to me.

44:31.321 --> 44:32.696
You write on guitar or keyboard?

44:32.821 --> 44:34.529
Yep, they just come.

44:39.279 --> 44:40.571
'60s Marshall?

44:40.696 --> 44:42.196
Oh, good eye. You like it?

44:42.321 --> 44:44.154
Is Chuck Norris a badass?

44:44.279 --> 44:47.321
This thing's like new, man.
I mean, crisp.

44:47.446 --> 44:49.487
You must've dropped some serious cash.

44:49.612 --> 44:51.821
A couple of dollars.
You guys ready. Let's go!

44:51.946 --> 44:52.904
All right, let's do this.

44:53.029 --> 44:56.487
So it goes D to B minor.
Sort of circles around a little bit.

44:56.612 --> 44:59.571
- All right, I got that, yeah.
- Bridge goes G major, E minor,

44:59.696 --> 45:01.696
- B minor...
- Yeah. I got it. I got it.

45:01.821 --> 45:03.154
All right, well, just listen in
for a couple verses

45:03.279 --> 45:05.612
- and join in when you're ready.
- No, I got it.

45:06.779 --> 45:08.446
Okay.

45:20.946 --> 45:23.612
The angel and the devil

45:24.112 --> 45:26.821
Secretly they get along

45:26.946 --> 45:30.529
Sitting up there with me in the middle

45:30.654 --> 45:32.821
From dusk till dawn

45:33.446 --> 45:38.821
I get so confused by it
Which way to turn

45:39.362 --> 45:44.987
They're looking at me like
"Decide which bridge to burn"

45:45.654 --> 45:47.987
If I'm wrong or right

45:48.487 --> 45:51.404
You stand by my side

45:51.696 --> 45:57.446
The devil never knows
The devil never knows

45:57.612 --> 46:03.654
Listen, listen as you forgive me
for the thousandth time

46:03.779 --> 46:06.821
The devil never knows

46:06.946 --> 46:09.612
The devil never knows

46:09.737 --> 46:12.946
Angel in disguise

46:18.571 --> 46:21.487
Looking over my shoulder

46:21.779 --> 46:25.654
Looking out, looking out for me

46:30.362 --> 46:34.321
Looking over my shoulder

46:34.446 --> 46:37.362
Looking out, looking out for me

46:41.029 --> 46:43.862
It's a long way down

46:45.612 --> 46:48.946
Even longer way back up

46:53.154 --> 46:57.862
And when the chips are down

46:57.987 --> 47:01.612
You'll always back me up

47:05.154 --> 47:09.987
You can talk me down

47:10.112 --> 47:13.279
Talk me out and talk me up

47:17.446 --> 47:22.820
When the shit goes down

47:26.154 --> 47:28.779
You'll always back me up

47:54.112 --> 47:56.779
Think you guys could put together
enough songs to play a full set?

47:56.904 --> 47:59.654
Thinking of making you
a regular on Saturdays.

47:59.945 --> 48:01.654
Seriously?

48:03.445 --> 48:04.737
- Yeah!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

48:04.862 --> 48:06.154
Hey, we only know four songs.

48:06.279 --> 48:09.279
Well, we'll do covers. Yeah, we're in.

48:10.445 --> 48:12.320
Last call, by the way.

48:12.445 --> 48:14.654
That's what I'm talking about. Yeah!

48:15.070 --> 48:18.529
Hey. Guys. Guys. Guys.
Hey, I already have a job.

48:18.695 --> 48:20.987
Well, wouldn't wanna jeopardize that.

48:21.112 --> 48:23.612
Heard you might get promoted to sanding.

48:37.112 --> 48:39.612
Sam? Sam!

48:40.362 --> 48:42.029
- Alard!
- Moment of your time?

48:42.154 --> 48:43.945
Oh, for you, pal? Two.

48:44.487 --> 48:48.279
The board has asked me to ask you
if you would consider moving your boat

48:48.404 --> 48:50.112
for the regatta.

48:50.237 --> 48:52.779
There's a regatta? I hadn't heard.

48:52.904 --> 48:53.904
Can we count on you?

48:54.029 --> 48:56.862
This is the premier event of our season.

48:56.987 --> 48:59.987
We'd like you to anchor on
the south end of the lake.

49:00.112 --> 49:01.987
I'll tell you what.

49:02.112 --> 49:06.362
I'll be on my best behavior if you stop
circulating that petition, or whatever,

49:06.487 --> 49:08.445
trying to get me kicked off the lake.

49:09.070 --> 49:10.779
You think I don't know about that?

49:13.070 --> 49:15.445
The name's Alaird, by the way!

49:17.112 --> 49:18.862
I'll move the fucking boat!

49:21.529 --> 49:23.404
- Well?
- He's moving the boat.

49:23.529 --> 49:25.070
All right.

50:03.862 --> 50:05.612
Hey, you seen Stiles?

50:07.779 --> 50:10.404
Nah? I guess it's no.

50:14.320 --> 50:16.820
Got to get out of this place.

50:21.112 --> 50:25.987
Don't know what's in my mind

50:26.112 --> 50:30.862
What am I thinkin'?

50:31.112 --> 50:36.820
Whatever I say is a lie

50:36.945 --> 50:41.945
Should I be drinkin'?

50:42.070 --> 50:47.154
Stop fucking singin'

50:53.278 --> 50:55.403
- We thought 'cause...
- No, I get it.

50:56.195 --> 50:58.737
You know, 'cause your boat and all.

50:58.862 --> 51:00.070
- I get it.
- You don't like it.

51:00.195 --> 51:01.737
No, it's fine.

51:03.362 --> 51:04.695
Sam hates the name.

51:04.820 --> 51:05.987
- What?
- No way.

51:06.112 --> 51:07.945
I don't hate the name.

51:08.070 --> 51:10.445
Man, I told you it was too artsy, bro.

51:10.778 --> 51:13.653
Don't blame me, I liked
"The Old Man and the Three."

51:18.945 --> 51:20.778
Two, three, four...

51:34.653 --> 51:38.195
Let there be music
and let there be thrills

51:38.320 --> 51:41.487
You don't like the silence
and you never will

51:41.612 --> 51:44.820
So jump on the ride
You can feel it inside

51:44.945 --> 51:47.320
Won't you come with us?

51:49.278 --> 51:52.195
Come all ye faithful
Don't suffer the fools

51:52.320 --> 51:55.987
We'll sound all the sirens
and bend all the rules

51:56.112 --> 51:57.570
The stars have aligned

51:57.695 --> 52:02.112
Leave your troubles behind you
and come with us

52:02.237 --> 52:06.612
We will play all night

52:06.737 --> 52:10.237
And pray the darkness
don't give way to the light

52:10.362 --> 52:15.778
I wish I may, I wish
I might stay with you

52:17.945 --> 52:21.112
Lift up your voices
and lend us your ears

52:21.237 --> 52:24.987
You know who your friends are
and everyone's here

52:25.112 --> 52:31.153
Why be alone? Don't pretend that
you don't wanna come with us

52:31.445 --> 52:38.945
We will play all night and pray
the darkness don't give way to the light

52:39.403 --> 52:45.445
I wish I may, wish I might stay with you

52:47.070 --> 52:50.653
Come with me, I'm yours for the takin'

52:50.778 --> 52:55.903
The louder you scream, the faster we go

52:56.028 --> 53:02.570
Don't try to wake me, just hold on
and never let go

53:02.695 --> 53:09.653
We will play all night and pray
the darkness don't give way to the light

53:09.778 --> 53:16.403
I wish I may, wish I might stay with you

53:17.070 --> 53:20.987
We will shine so bright

53:21.112 --> 53:23.487
Raise your glasses
and drink one to the night

53:23.612 --> 53:25.820
If it's okay

53:25.945 --> 53:29.945
I just might stay with you

53:30.070 --> 53:36.862
If it's okay I just might stay with you

54:14.778 --> 54:18.153
Hey, man, I got a big day tomorrow,
so I'm gonna head home.

54:18.278 --> 54:22.236
You want me to send one of them
over here on my way out?

54:22.778 --> 54:24.486
Come on.

54:24.986 --> 54:28.445
Look, I can get my head around
the stage fright, but not this.

54:29.320 --> 54:33.945
They're just hoping to talk to you guys.
This is fish in a barrel.

54:34.070 --> 54:35.986
So, I'll see you tomorrow?

54:36.111 --> 54:38.320
- What's the worse that could happen?
- Gee, I don't know.

54:38.445 --> 54:41.320
I think looking like an idiot
and fainting would rank right up there.

54:41.445 --> 54:42.820
Okay, so don't do that.

54:42.945 --> 54:44.986
You know, your advice sucks.

54:45.111 --> 54:46.195
Does it?

54:46.320 --> 54:48.195
Oh, yes, yes it does.

54:48.320 --> 54:50.070
Bad. Like, but just listen to yourself.

54:50.195 --> 54:51.986
I say, "I'm nervous."
You say, "Don't be nervous."

54:52.111 --> 54:55.320
I say, "I feel sick." You say, "Don't puke."
I say "I don't wanna go over there..."

54:55.445 --> 54:59.278
Okay, I get it. I get it.
All right, well, first listen.

54:59.403 --> 55:03.236
Don't go to hit on them.
Go over to talk to them.

55:03.361 --> 55:05.361
I just wanna drink my beer.

55:05.486 --> 55:06.486
- No, you don't.
- Yeah.

55:06.611 --> 55:08.653
No, no they're begging to talk to you.

55:08.778 --> 55:10.320
So stand up. Good man. Listen.

55:10.445 --> 55:13.111
You're gonna ask them about the show.
A little market research.

55:13.236 --> 55:15.486
See if they like the band.
Okay? Come on.

55:15.611 --> 55:18.236
Look, try to focus on them.

55:18.361 --> 55:22.736
All right? Go. All right, go.
Have a nice night.

55:24.778 --> 55:26.486
Who's winning?

55:26.611 --> 55:28.528
Oh, God. He's killin' me, man.

55:29.653 --> 55:30.986
I'm yankin' his head, bro.

55:31.111 --> 55:33.528
Did you just...

55:33.653 --> 55:35.403
I did. It's kinda cool.

55:36.736 --> 55:40.486
Rely on your friends
they will get you through

55:40.611 --> 55:42.153
They're there for you

55:42.278 --> 55:43.320
Hey, Sam!

55:43.445 --> 55:45.695
My kid sister saw you guys.
She thought you guys were excellent!

55:45.820 --> 55:47.736
- What was excellent?
- Your band!

55:49.028 --> 55:49.986
My band?

55:50.111 --> 55:51.195
Yeah! Your band.

55:51.320 --> 55:54.611
My kid sister saw you guys
and thought you guys were great.

55:55.278 --> 55:59.320
Well, yeah, tell her... Tell her thanks!

55:59.445 --> 56:01.320
Don't let it get you down

56:01.445 --> 56:07.361
It will bury you, very soon, oh, yeah

56:08.403 --> 56:10.153
- Effects pedals?
- Don't judge.

56:10.278 --> 56:11.861
Oh, I wouldn't dream of it.

56:11.986 --> 56:13.695
- What you lookin' for?
- A good loop.

56:13.820 --> 56:15.153
I wouldn't call any of them good,

56:15.278 --> 56:18.445
but I happen to have some quality ones
to your right there.

56:20.820 --> 56:23.236
I don't understand, man.
I just don't understand.

56:23.361 --> 56:26.570
Why not play an instrument that works
with the power off?

56:27.986 --> 56:29.653
- Thank you for coming in, Fred.
- Yeah, bye, Del.

56:29.778 --> 56:31.528
That's the Korg. It's very popular.

56:31.653 --> 56:33.070
If you ask me, the Keeley's better.

56:33.195 --> 56:35.236
Okay. Sold.

56:35.986 --> 56:37.653
Big Spender?

56:39.778 --> 56:42.403
You are a godsend, Sam.

56:42.611 --> 56:43.570
What?

56:43.695 --> 56:46.153
You know, what you're doing
for that boy.

56:46.278 --> 56:48.111
So, let's see,

56:48.236 --> 56:55.236
I'll give you 20% off of that,
so it's gonna be $174.52.

56:55.945 --> 56:58.611
We'll call it an even $180. There ya go.

57:03.361 --> 57:05.320
Hey, hey, Sam.

57:05.986 --> 57:07.445
Forgettin' somethin'?

57:08.820 --> 57:10.820
- There you go.
- Okay.

57:34.445 --> 57:35.611
Did you write that?

57:35.736 --> 57:37.361
Oh, Jesus.

57:37.945 --> 57:40.820
Haven't you heard of knocking?

57:40.945 --> 57:42.028
Is that yours?

57:42.153 --> 57:44.653
Yeah, yeah. It's not...
It's not finished.

57:44.778 --> 57:46.070
Can I hear it?

57:46.195 --> 57:50.653
No, no. Now is... Now is not...
Not a good time.

57:50.778 --> 57:53.528
Oh, yeah. You seem really busy.

57:57.611 --> 57:58.903
Hi.

57:59.028 --> 58:00.736
Hey. Hello.

58:02.778 --> 58:04.569
Joyce.

58:04.694 --> 58:06.653
This is Sam.

58:07.861 --> 58:09.486
We play in a band together.

58:09.611 --> 58:11.403
Nice to meet you.

58:13.194 --> 58:14.153
I should...

58:14.278 --> 58:16.069
Yeah.

58:20.736 --> 58:24.069
Just drive carefully, okay?

58:30.111 --> 58:31.569
Call me sometime.

58:31.694 --> 58:33.153
I will.

58:42.861 --> 58:44.819
You wanna go to the mall?

58:47.944 --> 58:50.528
Oh, come on. Lighten up, man.
You think I haven't been there?

58:50.653 --> 58:52.236
Been where?

58:52.361 --> 58:57.069
Well, you know. Desperate times
call for yada, yada, yada...

58:57.194 --> 58:58.819
You know, the girls in the Trill.

58:58.944 --> 59:03.403
I mean, the phrase "fistful of 20s
in a whorehouse" comes to mind.

59:05.028 --> 59:06.778
Joyce is my mom.

59:15.278 --> 59:16.403
Excuse me.

59:16.528 --> 59:20.069
God, sorry. Quentin, I'm sorry, man.

59:20.194 --> 59:23.819
I'm really... For what it's worth,
you have a very attractive, young mom.

59:23.944 --> 59:26.069
You want me to set you two up?

59:29.819 --> 59:33.611
It's tough when she shows up.

59:33.736 --> 59:35.986
She's got problems.

59:36.111 --> 59:39.111
My junior year of high school,
we lived out of the car.

59:39.528 --> 59:40.694
Wow.

59:40.819 --> 59:45.736
She's better.
But I will never be that poor again.

59:50.444 --> 59:51.903
Seriously?

59:54.028 --> 59:55.611
What do you think about these?

59:56.444 --> 59:59.153
Man, you're not the least bit
embarrassed to be shopping here?

59:59.278 --> 01:00:01.569
- Well, I would be, but they're for you.
- No, no, no.

01:00:01.694 --> 01:00:06.153
Hey, hey, hey. Style breeds confidence.

01:00:06.653 --> 01:00:08.736
Sounds like a bad commercial.

01:00:09.278 --> 01:00:15.111
That's Leo Burnett. I didn't do that one.
Here, here you go. Try those on.

01:00:36.361 --> 01:00:37.319
What?

01:00:37.444 --> 01:00:38.778
Stand still.

01:00:38.903 --> 01:00:40.528
What has gotten into you today?

01:00:40.653 --> 01:00:43.194
I gotta admit, you're kinda
freakin' me out, man.

01:00:43.319 --> 01:00:44.444
And try smiling, okay?

01:00:44.569 --> 01:00:48.194
You look like you stepped in a pile of
dog shit and everyone can smell it.

01:00:48.319 --> 01:00:50.969
Seriously, I'm looking for my friend Sam,
maybe you know him.

01:00:51.069 --> 01:00:54.528
He's about, oh, yay tall,
he's kind of a dick.

01:00:56.278 --> 01:00:58.444
Oh, God.

01:00:59.861 --> 01:01:02.361
Come on, stand up straight.
You look like a zombie. Please.

01:01:02.486 --> 01:01:04.486
You're crushing my soul. Here we go.

01:01:04.611 --> 01:01:05.736
That's so dramatic!

01:01:05.861 --> 01:01:07.028
Hey, how's it going, girls?

01:01:07.153 --> 01:01:08.194
Oh, God.

01:01:08.319 --> 01:01:10.736
We are not drunk enough
to buy what you're selling.

01:01:10.861 --> 01:01:13.278
Wow, hey! Does it look like
I'm trying to sell you something?

01:01:13.403 --> 01:01:14.361
- Yes.
- Yeah.

01:01:14.486 --> 01:01:15.694
- Absolutely.
- Pretty much.

01:01:15.819 --> 01:01:17.403
No, fair enough.
Listen, I just wanted to see

01:01:17.528 --> 01:01:19.361
if you guys were going to
stay for the band.

01:01:19.486 --> 01:01:21.402
We have to work early.

01:01:21.527 --> 01:01:23.236
No. What do you do?

01:01:23.361 --> 01:01:25.402
- Teach third grade.
- First grade.

01:01:25.527 --> 01:01:27.819
Oh, wow, teachin' on Sundays now, huh?

01:01:31.902 --> 01:01:33.652
Is the band any good?

01:01:33.777 --> 01:01:36.277
Well, I like to think so,
but I'm a bit biased.

01:01:36.402 --> 01:01:38.486
I'm Sam and that's Quentin.

01:01:38.611 --> 01:01:39.611
Q.

01:01:39.736 --> 01:01:41.361
- You're in the band?
- Watch it.

01:01:41.486 --> 01:01:45.069
That really hurts. What?

01:01:46.777 --> 01:01:49.069
I play guitar.

01:01:49.194 --> 01:01:51.444
I'm April.

01:01:51.569 --> 01:01:53.027
I'm Lizzie.

01:01:53.152 --> 01:01:55.569
April and Lizzie, I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna make another round here,

01:01:55.694 --> 01:01:57.736
see if I can drum up some more people
to stay for the show.

01:01:57.861 --> 01:01:59.652
You keep my friend here company

01:01:59.777 --> 01:02:03.194
and we'll play whatever song
you want to open with.

01:02:03.319 --> 01:02:04.611
- Any song?
- You name it.

01:02:04.736 --> 01:02:06.527
Paparazzi.

01:02:07.694 --> 01:02:09.402
- Lady Gaga.
- I know.

01:02:09.527 --> 01:02:11.152
- Bullshit!
- You did not know!

01:02:11.277 --> 01:02:13.111
All right, give me one more chance.

01:02:46.736 --> 01:02:51.777
The wheels on the bus go round and round

01:02:51.902 --> 01:02:56.319
Round and round, round and round

01:02:56.444 --> 01:03:01.152
The wheels on the bus go round and round

01:03:01.277 --> 01:03:04.694
All day long

01:03:04.819 --> 01:03:05.819
One, two, three, four!

01:03:05.944 --> 01:03:08.194
The band on the stage
says jump, jump, jump!

01:03:08.319 --> 01:03:10.569
Jump, jump, jump! Jump, jump, jump!

01:03:10.694 --> 01:03:12.819
The band on the stage
says jump, jump, jump!

01:03:12.944 --> 01:03:15.194
All day long!

01:03:15.319 --> 01:03:16.319
Willie on the bass says

01:03:16.444 --> 01:03:17.486
Turn around!

01:03:17.611 --> 01:03:19.861
Turn around, turn around!

01:03:19.986 --> 01:03:21.069
Willie on the bass says

01:03:21.194 --> 01:03:22.236
Turn around

01:03:22.361 --> 01:03:24.486
All day long

01:03:24.611 --> 01:03:25.819
The people in the house say

01:03:25.944 --> 01:03:26.986
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

01:03:27.111 --> 01:03:28.027
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

01:03:28.152 --> 01:03:29.236
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

01:03:29.361 --> 01:03:30.486
The people in the house say

01:03:30.611 --> 01:03:31.652
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

01:03:31.777 --> 01:03:33.986
All day long

01:03:34.111 --> 01:03:36.152
The owner of the joint says
Drain your glass!

01:03:36.277 --> 01:03:38.694
Drain your glass, drain your glass!

01:03:38.819 --> 01:03:41.111
The owner of the joint says
Drain your glass!

01:03:41.236 --> 01:03:47.319
All day long

01:04:01.236 --> 01:04:02.486
Let's pick up some stuff
to make margaritas.

01:04:02.611 --> 01:04:03.569
Good idea.

01:04:03.694 --> 01:04:05.277
Can we stop on the way?

01:04:05.444 --> 01:04:07.236
Hey, that was awesome.

01:04:07.361 --> 01:04:09.819
- Oh, good. Thank you.
- See you over there, man.

01:04:11.194 --> 01:04:13.152
Hey, you need a ride?

01:04:13.277 --> 01:04:14.902
No. Imma ride my bike.
I'll meet you over there.

01:04:15.027 --> 01:04:16.569
- Okay, all right.
- Okay.

01:04:16.944 --> 01:04:19.652
What kind of car is this? Is this safe?

01:04:19.777 --> 01:04:21.902
Yeah, we can all ride up front.

01:04:36.361 --> 01:04:37.319
Hi.

01:04:37.444 --> 01:04:39.319
Rudderless rocks!

01:04:39.444 --> 01:04:40.569
Yeah!

01:04:40.694 --> 01:04:42.777
You just see the show?

01:04:42.902 --> 01:04:44.944
You don't remember me, do you?

01:04:45.361 --> 01:04:46.819
Were you sitting at the bar?

01:04:46.944 --> 01:04:48.444
I'm Kate Lucas.

01:04:48.694 --> 01:04:51.944
We've already met, in Josh's room.

01:04:54.444 --> 01:04:57.110
Oh, my God.

01:04:57.235 --> 01:04:59.277
It's been better lately.

01:04:59.444 --> 01:05:03.902
Things have died down.
I even go out sometimes, like tonight.

01:05:04.027 --> 01:05:05.069
Oh, Kate.

01:05:05.194 --> 01:05:07.610
I go by Ann now. It's my middle name.

01:05:08.027 --> 01:05:10.485
So you're a rock star now, huh?

01:05:10.610 --> 01:05:12.694
Except you didn't write those songs,
did you?

01:05:12.819 --> 01:05:13.819
Listen.

01:05:13.944 --> 01:05:15.860
How could you play those songs?

01:05:15.985 --> 01:05:18.277
Shame on you!

01:05:52.944 --> 01:05:54.944
Hey, Sam!

01:07:07.110 --> 01:07:09.319
I was not expecting this.

01:07:09.610 --> 01:07:12.860
Shit. Hey.

01:07:12.985 --> 01:07:15.485
I have to stay ahead of it.

01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:21.402
Paint thinner's the only thing that...
But it's hell on your hands.

01:07:24.277 --> 01:07:25.985
Tequila?

01:07:28.277 --> 01:07:32.735
Yeah, I thought it was
a good choice for the occasion.

01:08:23.277 --> 01:08:24.984
Happy birthday, Josh.

01:08:25.109 --> 01:08:29.943
Happy birthday, Josh.

01:08:30.068 --> 01:08:32.943
I think for mothers and daughters,
it's sweet 16.

01:08:33.068 --> 01:08:35.527
For fathers and sons, it's 21.

01:08:37.234 --> 01:08:41.193
Was I always such an asshole?

01:08:41.359 --> 01:08:43.652
You really grew into it, though.

01:08:44.443 --> 01:08:46.484
Was I always the ice queen?

01:08:46.609 --> 01:08:48.984
There were some notable thaws.

01:08:54.318 --> 01:08:59.818
I had breakfast with one of the moms.
She wanted to talk, to forgive Josh...

01:08:59.943 --> 01:09:01.318
- Em.
- She didn't blame us. It was amazing.

01:09:01.443 --> 01:09:02.652
Don't. Don't.

01:09:02.777 --> 01:09:03.902
It was like a weight lifting.

01:09:04.027 --> 01:09:05.984
I've been thinking about
reaching out to the others.

01:09:06.109 --> 01:09:07.902
- I'd like you to do it with...
- You know what, I should go.

01:09:08.027 --> 01:09:08.984
It wasn't our fault.

01:09:09.109 --> 01:09:10.693
You think I don't know
it wasn't our fault?

01:09:10.818 --> 01:09:11.943
I don't know, Sam.
I don't know what you think!

01:09:12.068 --> 01:09:13.527
Hey, are you okay to drive?

01:09:13.652 --> 01:09:15.318
We did everything right.

01:09:15.443 --> 01:09:18.277
We did everything we could.
Josh was sick.

01:09:18.402 --> 01:09:21.609
You might want to dwell on this,
but I don't.

01:09:21.943 --> 01:09:24.152
What does it matter?
His fault, your fault, my fault.

01:09:24.277 --> 01:09:25.984
Who cares?

01:09:26.277 --> 01:09:28.568
I don't need to ask
for anybody's forgiveness.

01:09:28.693 --> 01:09:31.902
And I sure as fuck don't need
to meet any of the parents!

01:10:39.943 --> 01:10:42.443
Man, you look like shit.

01:10:42.943 --> 01:10:45.360
Well, hard to look better
than a man in uniform.

01:10:45.485 --> 01:10:47.318
Must have been one hell of a weekend.

01:10:47.443 --> 01:10:49.985
You know, me and Earl caught the
Crimson and Cream game on Saturday.

01:10:50.110 --> 01:10:51.485
Sounds like fun.

01:10:51.610 --> 01:10:53.110
Blah.

01:10:54.110 --> 01:10:57.110
Okay, I'm gonna grab some more water.

01:11:15.652 --> 01:11:17.485
What the hell you doin'?

01:11:18.985 --> 01:11:21.443
Well, most people call it a nap.

01:11:21.568 --> 01:11:25.443
In fact, in some cultures it's considered
a real boost to productivity.

01:11:25.568 --> 01:11:27.027
You're fired, smart guy.

01:11:27.152 --> 01:11:28.652
Well, if it weren't sad,

01:11:28.777 --> 01:11:33.568
it'd be kind of endearing that you don't
realize I quit about an hour ago.

01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:39.193
I keep trying to get Sam to go.

01:11:39.318 --> 01:11:40.318
- Oh, he will.
- On the deck!

01:11:40.443 --> 01:11:42.568
Yeah, yeah. He's not into it.
I don't know why.

01:11:42.693 --> 01:11:46.693
Damn! Look at this boat you have, man.

01:11:46.818 --> 01:11:51.943
I'm gonna be really disappointed.
Like, terribly upset. Naw, I'm just kiddin'.

01:11:56.401 --> 01:11:58.068
Permission to come aboard?

01:11:58.193 --> 01:12:00.401
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:12:14.276 --> 01:12:17.651
I know. I mean,
seriously, man, it's that good.

01:12:17.776 --> 01:12:20.151
I mean, sooner or later
someone's gonna sign us.

01:12:20.276 --> 01:12:24.068
Real Friends is a hit.
We do a regional tour and we're set.

01:12:24.443 --> 01:12:25.901
You really think so?

01:12:26.026 --> 01:12:28.401
Fuck, yeah, dude.
And we're talking eight to 10 a night.

01:12:28.526 --> 01:12:29.735
No way, dude.

01:12:29.860 --> 01:12:30.985
- Yeah.
- Thousand?

01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:33.443
You're not making donuts anymore, man.

01:12:36.026 --> 01:12:39.943
Don't, don't, don't, don't you worry, no

01:12:40.068 --> 01:12:42.193
Don't, don't, don't, don't you worry

01:12:42.318 --> 01:12:46.860
Don't, don't, don't you worry
about nothing

01:12:46.985 --> 01:12:51.360
Don't, don't, don't...

01:12:54.735 --> 01:12:56.651
Aiken!

01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:02.443
Oh, fuck. What?

01:13:03.318 --> 01:13:05.235
I'm not gonna beat around the bush,
or pussy foot.

01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:08.901
I think the best thing to do is say it...
Like a Band-Aid. Quick and...

01:13:09.026 --> 01:13:11.818
Well, not really painless
because usually that hurts.

01:13:11.943 --> 01:13:13.151
But what I mean is...

01:13:13.276 --> 01:13:14.985
We were asked to play
the BUZZ 104 Block Party.

01:13:15.110 --> 01:13:18.235
Look, we've been more than cool, man.
You only want to play Saturdays, fine.

01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:20.818
You don't want to play other bars, okay,
we can swallow that for now,

01:13:20.943 --> 01:13:22.985
but this is big, man. You owe us.

01:13:23.110 --> 01:13:25.318
Dude, dude, dude. Wilco.
Death Cab, radio promos.

01:13:25.443 --> 01:13:26.651
Do you know what this could mean, dude?

01:13:26.776 --> 01:13:28.485
This could be the first step.

01:13:28.610 --> 01:13:30.651
I mean, I don't wanna think
about the audience. Yes, I do.

01:13:30.776 --> 01:13:32.651
But if Ben Gibbard digs it, who knows?

01:13:32.776 --> 01:13:36.193
Yeah, they want us to play 15 minutes,
three songs or so.

01:13:36.318 --> 01:13:37.735
You can do this one thing for us.

01:13:37.860 --> 01:13:44.235
Guys, I know I'm dragging,
but it's complicated.

01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:45.568
I should think about it.

01:13:45.693 --> 01:13:48.485
There's nothing to think about, man.
We need this, Sam.

01:13:48.610 --> 01:13:51.485
I need to think about it.

01:13:54.193 --> 01:13:55.235
All right, easy.

01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:56.818
Stop! There's a pole!

01:13:56.943 --> 01:13:59.026
I know there's a pole back there!
I can see the damn pole.

01:13:59.151 --> 01:14:00.818
There's a gas thing up there!

01:14:00.943 --> 01:14:03.735
Don't tell me what to do, I can drive!
I've been drivin' all my damn life.

01:14:03.860 --> 01:14:05.068
Just a little bit,
just a little bit. Stop!

01:14:05.193 --> 01:14:08.735
Son of a bitch! Hey, come on, come on.
Comin' back, comin' back!

01:14:08.860 --> 01:14:10.318
You must be Tina.

01:14:10.526 --> 01:14:11.860
And you must be Sam.

01:14:11.985 --> 01:14:14.651
Who are you talkin' to? What are you...
Are you help, are you gonna help me?

01:14:14.776 --> 01:14:17.110
Well, that is a big sucker.

01:14:17.235 --> 01:14:19.193
- Watch it!
- Has its own zip code.

01:14:19.318 --> 01:14:20.401
Slop!

01:14:20.526 --> 01:14:21.901
Motherfuckin'...

01:14:22.026 --> 01:14:23.568
- Let me see if I can...
- I wouldn't...

01:14:23.693 --> 01:14:24.651
Son of a bitch!

01:14:24.776 --> 01:14:26.318
All right.

01:14:33.776 --> 01:14:36.318
Man. Did... Did you try...

01:14:36.443 --> 01:14:38.026
You're... Can you...
You need to cut it a bit...

01:14:38.151 --> 01:14:41.610
Yeah, yeah. Tried that twice.

01:14:41.735 --> 01:14:44.651
You know, I'm not too old to whoop yo'
ass if you start laughin', yeah?

01:14:44.776 --> 01:14:47.485
I would not think of that.
Did you buy this?

01:14:47.610 --> 01:14:49.235
Test drive.

01:14:51.110 --> 01:14:54.651
Oh, oh, all right. Oh, yeah, hold on.
Hold on.

01:14:55.651 --> 01:14:56.693
Wait a minute.
Go ahead, keep laughing.

01:14:56.818 --> 01:14:58.943
So it's funny now.

01:15:00.985 --> 01:15:03.860
Go ahead and laugh it up!
Keep laughin', both of you!

01:15:04.151 --> 01:15:08.110
Yeah, as long as I'm here to amuse you.

01:15:08.235 --> 01:15:09.818
- I told you so.
- Come on, Sam.

01:15:09.943 --> 01:15:12.526
Sooner I can get you what you need,
the sooner I'm done with you.

01:15:12.651 --> 01:15:14.318
Hey, can I give it a shot?

01:15:20.109 --> 01:15:22.443
All right, you get it out
without a scratch,

01:15:22.943 --> 01:15:25.484
I'll give you whatever
you came for for free.

01:15:25.609 --> 01:15:28.234
Come on, Tina, don't help him.

01:15:30.276 --> 01:15:31.318
I got it!

01:15:31.443 --> 01:15:34.109
You did not. You're full of shit!

01:15:36.776 --> 01:15:38.276
Have you got one of these?

01:15:38.401 --> 01:15:39.568
I do.

01:15:39.693 --> 01:15:42.526
I packed those tubes away.
I know where they are.

01:15:42.651 --> 01:15:44.693
Nice to finally meet you, Sam.

01:15:44.818 --> 01:15:46.859
And you, too, Tina.

01:15:54.109 --> 01:15:55.984
Can I ask you a question?

01:15:58.193 --> 01:16:00.276
How come you're not playing the gig
on Saturday?

01:16:00.609 --> 01:16:02.193
How do you know about that?

01:16:02.318 --> 01:16:04.276
Shit, that's all I do know about.

01:16:04.401 --> 01:16:06.734
If Q ain't in here asking me to play
the damn guitar, I got to hear him

01:16:06.859 --> 01:16:08.443
runnin' his mouth
about how you ain't playing the gig.

01:16:08.568 --> 01:16:09.693
Well, I never said
I wasn't going to play the gig.

01:16:09.818 --> 01:16:11.026
I said I had to think about it.

01:16:11.151 --> 01:16:14.401
What's there to think about?
You're a band. It's a gig.

01:16:14.526 --> 01:16:18.318
- They're not that easy to come by.
- I need to think about it, though.

01:16:18.443 --> 01:16:22.109
I'm just... I'm too old
for this shit, man.

01:16:22.234 --> 01:16:24.068
Wow.

01:16:24.943 --> 01:16:28.859
What you talkin' about, too old?
T-Bone Walker played till he was 77.

01:16:28.984 --> 01:16:30.818
Died with a guitar in his hand.

01:16:30.943 --> 01:16:32.651
Well, I don't want to die
with a guitar in my hand.

01:16:32.776 --> 01:16:34.693
Then what you doin' in a band?

01:16:34.818 --> 01:16:37.776
Beginning to wonder that myself.

01:16:40.276 --> 01:16:41.359
Hey. Slim!

01:16:41.484 --> 01:16:43.318
Hey. So what's up with that
"for sale" sign in the window?

01:16:43.443 --> 01:16:44.734
Yeah, man.
Puttin' the business up for sale.

01:16:44.859 --> 01:16:46.734
Me and Tina are gonna do some traveling.

01:16:46.859 --> 01:16:47.859
Oh, really?

01:16:47.984 --> 01:16:50.026
Take a look around.
See somethin' you like, let me know.

01:16:50.151 --> 01:16:57.359
You're so emotional
You're such a beautiful mess

01:17:08.943 --> 01:17:11.401
One thing I really hate

01:17:11.526 --> 01:17:13.526
Is when Sam is really late

01:17:13.651 --> 01:17:16.276
Hurry up, hurry up and wait

01:17:16.401 --> 01:17:19.151
Don't be sorry

01:17:19.276 --> 01:17:21.984
Let's make the most of us

01:17:22.109 --> 01:17:23.484
Love played a joke on us

01:17:23.609 --> 01:17:25.693
I wanna play this at the block party.

01:17:25.818 --> 01:17:26.984
Yes!

01:17:27.109 --> 01:17:28.318
The man has spoken.

01:17:28.443 --> 01:17:30.484
- All right!
- No.

01:17:30.609 --> 01:17:34.109
I wanna play Over Your Shoulder,
Real Friends, and close with this.

01:17:34.234 --> 01:17:35.484
- It's not finished yet.
- It's finished.

01:17:35.609 --> 01:17:37.901
That's the deal.
We close with your song.

01:17:38.026 --> 01:17:40.193
When was the meeting where we
made you lord and master of the band?

01:17:40.318 --> 01:17:42.359
'Cause I think I missed it.

01:17:42.818 --> 01:17:44.401
It's the only way I'll do the show.

01:17:44.526 --> 01:17:46.026
It's a good song.

01:17:46.151 --> 01:17:48.359
Makes me nervous to agree with Sam,
but he's right.

01:17:49.693 --> 01:17:51.276
So it's settled.

01:17:51.401 --> 01:17:52.484
Count it off.

01:17:52.609 --> 01:17:54.359
Let's do it.

01:18:05.901 --> 01:18:08.568
Fine with me, I didn't wanna play
that show anyway.

01:18:08.693 --> 01:18:09.693
Come on, Q.

01:18:09.818 --> 01:18:12.276
- Come on, bro.
- Okay, okay, okay. Fine, fine, fine, fine.

01:18:12.401 --> 01:18:15.234
All right, fine.
We'll play the fucking song.

01:18:16.901 --> 01:18:18.693
It's a good song.

01:18:18.818 --> 01:18:20.484
You're such an asshole!

01:18:24.651 --> 01:18:27.151
Wake up in your favorite shoes

01:18:27.276 --> 01:18:29.693
Sunsets and afternoons

01:18:29.818 --> 01:18:31.859
Make it up make it up for me

01:18:31.984 --> 01:18:34.026
and change the story

01:18:35.109 --> 01:18:37.693
Stylishly under-dressed

01:18:37.818 --> 01:18:40.443
Unfazed and unimpressed

01:18:40.568 --> 01:18:44.443
Carry on, carry on, it's great
You can't ignore me

01:18:44.568 --> 01:18:46.859
Don't stop you're good with what you got

01:18:46.984 --> 01:18:49.817
You're so emotional

01:18:49.942 --> 01:18:52.984
You're such a beautiful mess

01:19:22.942 --> 01:19:25.984
Tonight when everyone
is cheering for those songs,

01:19:26.109 --> 01:19:27.859
how are you gonna feel about that?

01:19:28.109 --> 01:19:31.401
This whole thing, this fantasy
you're living in, it's... It's impressive.

01:19:31.526 --> 01:19:32.651
- Kate...
- Ann.

01:19:32.776 --> 01:19:34.317
It's Ann, remember?

01:19:34.442 --> 01:19:37.276
- Ann, please.
- Do you even know why I changed my name?

01:19:37.401 --> 01:19:39.401
Because they kept calling me.

01:19:39.526 --> 01:19:40.817
What kind of sex did we have?

01:19:40.942 --> 01:19:43.317
Did we have a cult?
How many were there?

01:19:43.442 --> 01:19:45.942
I had to quit school.
Josh ruined my life.

01:19:46.067 --> 01:19:48.067
- That's what your son did to me.
- I'm so sorry.

01:19:48.192 --> 01:19:50.609
Sorry? Know what? I should thank you.

01:19:50.734 --> 01:19:54.234
I think I'm finally finished
with you and your son.

01:20:13.984 --> 01:20:15.859
Is it true?

01:20:17.359 --> 01:20:19.067
Yeah.

01:20:21.442 --> 01:20:25.651
Today is really not turning out
like I thought it would.

01:20:26.276 --> 01:20:28.067
I should have told you.

01:20:28.234 --> 01:20:29.567
You think?

01:20:29.692 --> 01:20:31.901
Dude, we can still play the show, man.
Think about it.

01:20:32.026 --> 01:20:34.151
We're only doing three songs,
one of them's yours.

01:20:34.276 --> 01:20:35.442
- Yours is the best one.
- Guys...

01:20:35.567 --> 01:20:37.317
- Yeah, I don't know what she told you...
- You need this.

01:20:37.442 --> 01:20:40.526
After tonight we stop playing 'em
forever, and we never play 'em again.

01:20:40.651 --> 01:20:42.859
No one's the wiser,
but we don't miss this chance.

01:20:42.984 --> 01:20:44.151
- No one would know.
- I would know.

01:20:44.276 --> 01:20:47.817
I would know.
Playing these songs is wrong.

01:20:47.942 --> 01:20:49.817
It's wrong.

01:20:53.692 --> 01:20:55.734
Isn't it, Sam?

01:20:58.276 --> 01:21:00.067
It's wrong.

01:21:01.526 --> 01:21:02.901
All right, I'm gettin' my stuff.

01:21:03.026 --> 01:21:06.192
Q, please, man.
Seriously, think about this.

01:21:06.317 --> 01:21:07.484
Come on, bro.

01:21:07.609 --> 01:21:09.526
Pack up the rest of my shit, all right?

01:21:09.776 --> 01:21:11.442
You screwed us, Sam.

01:21:11.692 --> 01:21:12.734
He was... He was my son.

01:21:12.859 --> 01:21:15.109
Yeah, and you must have been
a hell of a father.

01:21:15.234 --> 01:21:17.067
Listen.

01:21:22.276 --> 01:21:24.151
Shit.

01:21:42.651 --> 01:21:44.359
What are you havin'?

01:21:44.484 --> 01:21:46.776
Whiskey. Neat.

01:21:51.609 --> 01:21:53.609
Double it up for me, will ya?

01:22:11.109 --> 01:22:13.109
Well, fuck you.

01:22:33.025 --> 01:22:35.734
Oh, fuck.

01:22:44.234 --> 01:22:46.359
Oh, fuck!

01:22:54.442 --> 01:22:56.400
Hell, no.

01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:05.109
Oh, no, buddy.

01:23:29.525 --> 01:23:31.942
Fuck. Fuck.

01:23:36.650 --> 01:23:38.609
Fuck.

01:23:43.609 --> 01:23:45.442
What the fuck?

01:23:57.150 --> 01:23:59.442
Shut the fuck up!

01:24:01.942 --> 01:24:07.150
Ladies and gentlemen, the annual Lake
Channing Summer Regatta is underway!

01:24:16.692 --> 01:24:19.067
Beginning at 2:00.
And the silent auction...

01:24:19.192 --> 01:24:21.400
Okay, a little to the right! Nice.

01:24:21.525 --> 01:24:22.984
Nice.

01:24:23.109 --> 01:24:24.109
Looks great, guys.

01:24:24.234 --> 01:24:25.734
Hey. Do you see that?

01:24:25.859 --> 01:24:28.859
That's it. You hear that?

01:24:33.150 --> 01:24:34.484
Hey, check it out!

01:24:34.609 --> 01:24:36.984
What the hell is he doing?

01:24:46.442 --> 01:24:47.734
- Look!
- Bring it around!

01:24:47.859 --> 01:24:50.525
Break left! Tag left!

01:24:52.859 --> 01:24:55.650
- Get away!
- God, what is he doing?

01:24:56.692 --> 01:24:57.942
Break off!

01:24:58.067 --> 01:24:59.775
What a jerk!

01:25:06.525 --> 01:25:08.234
You're a jerk!

01:25:17.984 --> 01:25:20.650
I'm gonna remember your face, douche.

01:25:20.984 --> 01:25:22.067
What's wrong with you?

01:25:22.192 --> 01:25:24.150
What are you doing?

01:25:24.984 --> 01:25:27.484
What the hell do think you're doing?

01:25:34.192 --> 01:25:35.900
I'm over here.

01:25:36.525 --> 01:25:40.317
I'm sorry it's so late, I...
I didn't have anyone else to call.

01:25:59.233 --> 01:26:03.900
You remember the university shootings
at Smythe Library a couple of years ago?

01:26:04.108 --> 01:26:06.317
Yeah. You talkin' about your boy, huh?

01:26:08.858 --> 01:26:11.108
Oh, yeah, I recognized you
when you first came into the shop.

01:26:11.233 --> 01:26:14.317
Just took me a minute
to figure out where from.

01:26:14.442 --> 01:26:16.067
Well, then, you know my story.

01:26:16.192 --> 01:26:19.733
No. I don't know your story, man.
All I know is what I read.

01:26:22.983 --> 01:26:25.567
What would you say if I told you that

01:26:28.067 --> 01:26:34.150
my son wrote all the songs
the band plays?

01:26:36.567 --> 01:26:38.317
Damn.

01:26:38.442 --> 01:26:40.650
I'd say, "I didn't see that comin'."

01:26:41.942 --> 01:26:43.358
Wait, does Quentin know?

01:26:43.483 --> 01:26:45.108
He does now.

01:26:45.233 --> 01:26:47.525
Oh, yeah? How'd he take it?

01:26:48.108 --> 01:26:50.108
- There ya go.
- Well, I can't say as I blame him.

01:26:50.233 --> 01:26:52.692
Damn! Your boy wrote all that music?

01:26:52.942 --> 01:26:55.025
Well, what were you thinking?

01:26:57.442 --> 01:26:59.733
- He was my son.
- They were all somebody's sons, Sam.

01:26:59.858 --> 01:27:02.192
Somebody's sons, somebody's
daughters. Your boy killed them.

01:27:02.317 --> 01:27:03.692
I know,

01:27:03.817 --> 01:27:08.150
but he was my son.

01:27:12.983 --> 01:27:18.108
Well, I can't say I know half of what
you've been through, man.

01:27:18.233 --> 01:27:21.733
But Quentin deserves better.

01:27:26.858 --> 01:27:29.067
I know.

01:28:24.775 --> 01:28:26.817
My little boy.

01:28:28.817 --> 01:28:32.900
My boy, my boy.

01:28:33.692 --> 01:28:36.233
My boy. Oh, my boy.

01:28:36.358 --> 01:28:39.025
My boy...

01:29:20.816 --> 01:29:23.983
- You okay?
- No. Not yet.

01:29:25.733 --> 01:29:26.983
What are you doin' here?

01:29:27.108 --> 01:29:28.566
I...

01:29:29.191 --> 01:29:32.608
I think someday, Phillip's gonna
wanna know who his brother really was,

01:29:32.733 --> 01:29:34.566
not just what he's going to read.
And when that happens,

01:29:34.691 --> 01:29:37.316
I think you should give him these.

01:29:41.025 --> 01:29:42.650
Wait.

01:29:46.233 --> 01:29:47.900
Just listen.

01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:03.566
Thought you played that old Epiphone.

01:30:05.775 --> 01:30:07.691
Not anymore.

01:30:09.775 --> 01:30:12.358
I just wanted to come by and...

01:30:13.108 --> 01:30:14.816
And say thanks.

01:30:15.566 --> 01:30:18.608
No need, man. Not even a little bit.

01:30:19.108 --> 01:30:20.941
Okay.

01:30:21.233 --> 01:30:23.358
- Okay.
- Are those Quentin's guitars?

01:30:23.483 --> 01:30:25.441
Yeah. Stubborn little bastard.

01:30:25.566 --> 01:30:27.650
I told him I'm damn near
givin' things away around here,

01:30:27.775 --> 01:30:32.275
but he won't take no for an answer.
Wants me to sell 'em on consignment.

01:30:34.108 --> 01:30:36.108
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:30:37.775 --> 01:30:41.941
I forgot to ask. How's this goin'?

01:30:42.066 --> 01:30:44.108
Got an offer.

01:30:44.441 --> 01:30:46.150
- That's great.
- Yeah.

01:30:46.983 --> 01:30:48.525
Well...

01:30:51.691 --> 01:30:53.650
You take care of yourself.

01:30:56.525 --> 01:30:58.400
- Okay.
- All right.

01:31:08.566 --> 01:31:10.733
A good offer?

01:31:18.941 --> 01:31:21.816
Heard the donuts in here
are better than sex.

01:31:24.108 --> 01:31:27.025
You're doin' it wrong, then.

01:31:30.316 --> 01:31:31.608
Can we talk?

01:31:31.733 --> 01:31:33.733
I'm kind of behind here.

01:31:34.150 --> 01:31:38.191
Okay. Guess I need to
order something then, huh?

01:31:39.275 --> 01:31:40.691
What are those?

01:31:40.816 --> 01:31:42.775
Cherry.

01:31:44.691 --> 01:31:46.233
That one?

01:31:46.358 --> 01:31:48.566
Blueberry fritter.

01:31:54.525 --> 01:31:57.441
That first night that we
got up there and played,

01:31:58.525 --> 01:32:04.191
it was like I got to meet a Josh
that I never knew.

01:32:04.316 --> 01:32:07.733
And every new song we played,
I learned more about him.

01:32:07.858 --> 01:32:09.233
It was intoxicating.

01:32:09.358 --> 01:32:12.108
I couldn't stop. I didn't wanna stop,

01:32:12.816 --> 01:32:16.650
but it wasn't Josh.

01:32:19.066 --> 01:32:21.275
It was you.

01:32:21.900 --> 01:32:23.900
Oh, my God, Quentin.

01:32:24.233 --> 01:32:26.775
I am so sorry.

01:32:26.900 --> 01:32:30.816
The last thing I ever wanted to do
was fuck up another young man's life.

01:32:30.941 --> 01:32:32.816
Is that what you think?

01:32:33.316 --> 01:32:35.525
Well, you can let yourself off the hook
for that one.

01:32:35.650 --> 01:32:38.691
I've been fuckin' up my life
for 21 years, man.

01:32:38.816 --> 01:32:40.150
Then stop.

01:32:40.275 --> 01:32:43.608
Stop fucking it up.

01:32:43.733 --> 01:32:46.483
Keep going.
You don't need those songs.

01:32:46.608 --> 01:32:48.191
You don't need me.

01:32:48.316 --> 01:32:50.649
I want you to keep going.
I want you to write songs.

01:32:50.774 --> 01:32:52.691
I want you to make music.

01:32:52.816 --> 01:32:55.816
Don't give up because of me.

01:32:55.941 --> 01:32:57.733
Quitters never win.

01:32:59.649 --> 01:33:04.108
"Quitters never win"?
Is that seriously the best you've got?

01:33:04.233 --> 01:33:05.816
"Quitters never win"?

01:33:05.941 --> 01:33:08.483
I... I...

01:33:17.191 --> 01:33:19.191
That's the best I got.

01:33:20.149 --> 01:33:22.108
Quitters never win.

01:34:20.733 --> 01:34:23.733
My son's name was Josh Manning.

01:34:26.066 --> 01:34:30.691
Two years ago,
he shot and killed six people.

01:34:33.608 --> 01:34:35.816
This was his song.

01:34:51.274 --> 01:34:56.941
Stuck in your confines

01:34:57.066 --> 01:35:01.066
chewin' it over

01:35:02.816 --> 01:35:08.733
Caught in your headlights

01:35:08.941 --> 01:35:13.483
Stop staring

01:35:14.608 --> 01:35:19.816
You don't know what's on my mind

01:35:19.941 --> 01:35:24.774
What am I thinking?

01:35:25.233 --> 01:35:30.858
Whatever I say is a lie

01:35:31.649 --> 01:35:36.108
So stop staring

01:35:37.399 --> 01:35:41.483
Tread carefully

01:35:45.316 --> 01:35:50.983
Take a breath and count the stars

01:35:51.108 --> 01:35:56.649
Let the world go round without you

01:35:56.774 --> 01:35:58.733
If you're somewhere

01:35:58.858 --> 01:36:04.024
you can hear this song

01:36:05.108 --> 01:36:07.483
sing along

01:36:07.608 --> 01:36:12.733
Close your eyes and count to 10

01:36:13.108 --> 01:36:18.649
Maybe love's the only answer

01:36:18.774 --> 01:36:21.732
I will find a way

01:36:21.857 --> 01:36:26.899
to sing your song

01:36:27.024 --> 01:36:29.399
so sing along

01:36:35.274 --> 01:36:41.107
Help me understand

01:36:41.232 --> 01:36:45.066
the silence

01:36:46.232 --> 01:36:52.024
We make the best we can

01:36:52.441 --> 01:36:56.482
of everything

01:36:57.274 --> 01:37:02.899
Nothing is what it was

01:37:03.024 --> 01:37:07.357
Turnin' the light on

01:37:08.191 --> 01:37:14.274
Honesty changes us

01:37:14.482 --> 01:37:19.191
completely

01:37:19.857 --> 01:37:24.316
Tread carefully

01:37:28.191 --> 01:37:33.982
Take a breath and count the stars

01:37:34.107 --> 01:37:39.316
Let the world go round without you

01:37:39.441 --> 01:37:41.899
If you're somewhere

01:37:42.024 --> 01:37:47.524
you can hear my song

01:37:48.441 --> 01:37:51.107
sing along

01:37:51.232 --> 01:37:56.732
Close your eyes and count to 10

01:37:56.857 --> 01:38:02.274
Maybe love's the only answer

01:38:02.399 --> 01:38:05.566
I will find a way

01:38:05.691 --> 01:38:10.357
to sing your song

01:38:10.649 --> 01:38:12.441
If you sing along

01:38:13.482 --> 01:38:19.191
What is lost can't be replaced

01:38:19.316 --> 01:38:24.607
What is gone is not forgotten

01:38:24.732 --> 01:38:27.816
I wish you were here

01:38:27.941 --> 01:38:33.232
to sing along

01:38:33.607 --> 01:38:36.482
my son

01:38:38.982 --> 01:38:41.441
my son

01:38:44.691 --> 01:38:47.232
my son

01:38:50.649 --> 01:38:52.107
my son
