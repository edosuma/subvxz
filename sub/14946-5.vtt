Previously on Continuum...

00:02.670 --> 00:03.750
Down! Everybody down!

00:03.838 --> 00:05.954
KIERA: Liber8 is fishing
for something specific

00:06.048 --> 00:07.959
in those safety
deposit boxes.

00:08.092 --> 00:09.923
What's happening?
First step in a whole
new battle strategy.

00:10.052 --> 00:13.215
KIERA: You used the same
secret SIM card
for a year.

00:13.306 --> 00:14.341
Liber8 wanted me
on the hook and I...

00:14.432 --> 00:16.263
Save it, Betty.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.181
KIERA: We're going
to use you as bait.

00:18.269 --> 00:19.850
Did you really think
they were gonna
let you play

00:19.937 --> 00:21.313
Steve Jobs without a fight?

00:21.397 --> 00:23.809
KELLOG: You need a shark
to take on these sharks.

00:23.900 --> 00:24.980
Stay away from Alec.

00:25.067 --> 00:26.056
Which one?

00:26.152 --> 00:28.268
So I guess we're not
gonna be pals then, huh?

00:28.362 --> 00:29.397
I don't see how.

00:37.663 --> 00:39.199
Don't forget to do
your homework, Tio.

00:39.290 --> 00:42.157
(SIGHS) Mom, I hate fractions.

00:43.169 --> 00:46.206
So did I, but you
won't pass your exams
without them.

00:46.297 --> 00:47.707
(WIND HOWLING)

00:50.426 --> 00:52.291
Tio, Ithought I told
you to close the door.

00:55.097 --> 00:56.712
(HEAVY BREATHING)

00:59.227 --> 01:00.216
Daddy!

01:01.020 --> 01:02.305
(LAUGHING) Hey!

01:02.647 --> 01:04.933
Oh!
I missed
you so much!

01:05.983 --> 01:07.814
Where have you been?

01:07.902 --> 01:09.767
You missed my birthday.

01:09.862 --> 01:11.773
I didn't want to, baby.

01:12.448 --> 01:13.437
Hey!

01:13.532 --> 01:15.397
Daddy knows he
shouldn't be here.

01:15.493 --> 01:16.858
We talked about
staying safe.

01:16.953 --> 01:18.659
l have another way.

01:19.997 --> 01:21.407
Go play. Go.

01:24.585 --> 01:26.121
Her DNA engram
is forged.

01:26.212 --> 01:27.418
If they find out
that she's the
daughter of a...

01:27.505 --> 01:29.166
A fugitive?
A terrorist?

01:30.675 --> 01:32.540
You don't believe that.

01:33.678 --> 01:34.963
It doesn't matter
what I believe.

01:35.721 --> 01:37.097
Belief is the only thing
that keeps me going

01:37.181 --> 01:38.682
when I'm dying
to be with you both.

01:39.225 --> 01:40.715
I mean, Tio needs
to learn that

01:41.227 --> 01:42.637
belief is...

01:45.064 --> 01:48.727
Belief is only
a problem when
you're eavesdropping!

01:49.318 --> 01:51.104
Because this is
what happens!

01:54.031 --> 01:55.567
(BOTH LAUGHING)

02:14.969 --> 02:16.175
MAN: To the right!

02:16.595 --> 02:17.801
WOMAN: On the right!

02:17.888 --> 02:18.877
MAN: In, in, in!

02:20.474 --> 02:21.634
Clear!

02:22.476 --> 02:23.465
Clear.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.181
All clear, sir.

02:38.743 --> 02:41.735
His pheromone levels
are still ambient.

02:41.829 --> 02:45.913
It's better for
the both of you

02:46.042 --> 02:48.249
ifyou were to
tell the truth.

02:50.755 --> 02:52.245
What's your
connection to him?

02:52.923 --> 02:55.414
Please. He threatened
to kill us.

02:55.509 --> 02:56.840
We're good citizens.

02:56.927 --> 02:57.962
We're loyal.

03:02.475 --> 03:06.059
And what about
you, sweetheart?

03:06.145 --> 03:08.852
Are you loyal to
the Corporate Congress?

03:10.441 --> 03:12.432
I took the oath in school.

03:14.070 --> 03:16.812
You want to help your
mother out, don't you?

03:17.615 --> 03:19.276
So tell me,

03:20.785 --> 03:22.366
where did he go?

03:36.384 --> 03:37.794
Verta, down.

03:39.011 --> 03:40.046
Now.

03:43.015 --> 03:44.391
WOMAN: I got him!

03:46.394 --> 03:48.055
MAN: Get down!

03:48.145 --> 03:49.134
Get down now!

03:53.734 --> 03:54.723
Easy.

04:01.700 --> 04:02.906
Down on your knees!

04:10.126 --> 04:11.741

05:15.065 --> 05:17.101
#kissmyassFermitas?

05:17.651 --> 05:19.107
Epic!

05:34.043 --> 05:35.078
Whoa!

05:41.675 --> 05:44.462
The corporate security
was primitive at best.

05:44.553 --> 05:45.542
Those protestors
never should have

05:45.638 --> 05:47.128
made it past
the lobby.

05:47.223 --> 05:50.306
Why paint a bull's-eye
on Fermitas?

05:50.392 --> 05:52.553
(LAUGHS) Well, that's
an ironic choice of words.

05:52.645 --> 05:55.307
Fermitas is one
of the world's largest
weapons manufacturers,

05:55.397 --> 05:58.059
like the Wal-Mart
for warlords.

05:58.150 --> 05:59.356
You chasing this one down?

05:59.443 --> 06:01.354
Trespassing and
penny-ante protests?

06:01.445 --> 06:03.936
Well, it's not really
my department.

06:04.031 --> 06:06.113
It seems to me like
Liber8's recruiting methods

06:06.200 --> 06:07.610
are paying off.

06:07.910 --> 06:09.446
Civil disobedience has
been around long before

06:09.537 --> 06:11.448
your friends showed up.

06:13.082 --> 06:14.288
Carlos?

06:21.257 --> 06:23.498
CURTIS: We've both
traveled long distances,

06:23.592 --> 06:27.210
seen things other people
can't know or understand.

06:27.304 --> 06:29.386
We could help
each other.

06:29.473 --> 06:31.338
We're already on
the same team,

06:31.433 --> 06:32.593
what more do you want?

06:32.935 --> 06:35.221
Everyone needs
a partner.

06:35.312 --> 06:36.301
Carlos, Alec...

06:36.397 --> 06:38.809
Those relationships
are fracturing.

06:41.485 --> 06:43.851
Does Katherine know
you're here?

06:43.946 --> 06:45.402
She asked me to
keep an eye on you.

06:45.489 --> 06:48.822
Hmm. That is
not an answer.

06:49.910 --> 06:53.323
It's possible his
offer was a gesture
of goodwill.

06:53.414 --> 06:56.076
Goodwill is not
in his arsenal.

06:56.166 --> 06:57.497
I don't trust him.

06:57.585 --> 07:00.076
Well, he knows
I respect you
and he knows we talk,

07:00.170 --> 07:02.627
so maybe that's
all it is.

07:02.715 --> 07:05.206
I appreciate you
telling me, though.

07:06.343 --> 07:08.925
Most of the people
in this cell don't
have families.

07:09.013 --> 07:11.504
They found themselves
lost in traditional society.

07:11.807 --> 07:13.468
Some l recruited
off the streets,

07:13.559 --> 07:15.675
others found
their way to me.

07:16.353 --> 07:18.685
For many of them,
motherless,

07:19.356 --> 07:21.347
I can fulfill that role.

07:24.194 --> 07:26.810
How do things
feel to you?

07:26.905 --> 07:30.944
Liber8 has been
quiet since the
bank robberies.

07:31.035 --> 07:33.947
All that energy and theater
to little or no effect.

07:34.371 --> 07:35.451
You feel that?

07:36.457 --> 07:38.994
In a way.
Don't you?

07:42.630 --> 07:43.710
What's in there?

07:50.763 --> 07:52.549
I'm glad you're here.

Okay, if I don't answer
this, Lucas is gonna
wonder why.

08:08.405 --> 08:10.487
You think I'm gonna
let you send him
some kind of message

08:10.574 --> 08:12.189
by the way
you answer? No.

08:12.284 --> 08:13.865
I will answer it
any way you want.

08:14.078 --> 08:15.409
He doesn't call
that often.

08:15.496 --> 08:16.827
I said no.

08:19.958 --> 08:21.744
What if she's right?

08:22.461 --> 08:25.669
We'll pick the moment to
use her to our advantage.

08:25.756 --> 08:26.996
On ourterms.

08:32.429 --> 08:33.805
Hey, where you been?

08:33.889 --> 08:35.425
I ran into an old friend.

08:35.516 --> 08:37.552
Huh! It's funny,
I wasn't aware you
had any of those.

08:37.643 --> 08:38.632

08:41.647 --> 08:42.762
What is it?

08:44.775 --> 08:47.482
This departmentjust
can't catch a break.

08:51.031 --> 08:53.022
Break and enter.

08:53.117 --> 08:54.573
Criminal trespass.

08:54.827 --> 08:55.987
Reckless endangerment.

08:56.078 --> 08:59.286
Just call me a terrorist.
That's what we all
are to you.

09:01.125 --> 09:03.411
This is being
recorded in front
of two witnesses,

09:03.502 --> 09:05.788
Agent Cameron and
Detective Fonnegra.

09:06.296 --> 09:08.753
I will stipulate
that you were being
sarcastic just then.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.381
Don't repeat that mistake.

09:11.468 --> 09:14.380
Now, for the record,
you've already been
advised of your rights.

09:15.180 --> 09:17.341
What we did was harmless.
Nobody got hurt.

09:17.433 --> 09:21.051
What you did is an
indictable offense!
You could serve time.

09:21.145 --> 09:22.100
Now I want to know why.

09:22.187 --> 09:25.224
I really have
to say it after
the bloodbath at LGU?

09:25.315 --> 09:26.816
I'm taking a stand.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.231
Thatshooﬂng,
yourtacﬂcs”.

09:28.318 --> 09:31.310
Were necessary
and proportionate
to the threat.

senous,Dad.

Christine, this is
as far as I am
willing to stretch.

Now, say the words.

09:47.463 --> 09:48.669
(SCOFFS)

09:50.632 --> 09:51.712
I want a lawyer.

10:01.268 --> 10:03.429
Well, we're not gonna
be able to sweep
that one under the rug.

10:03.520 --> 10:05.602
If she isn't charged,
it puts him and the
whole department

10:05.689 --> 10:06.929
under a microscope.

10:07.024 --> 10:09.265
She didn't do
this on her own.

10:09.359 --> 10:11.145
Oh yeah, sure,
they're both guilty.

10:11.487 --> 10:13.398
But that other kid's
not gonna lead the news.

10:13.739 --> 10:14.945
They are.

10:15.032 --> 10:17.865
Ah, this is lose-lose
any way you play it.

10:19.703 --> 10:22.194
I think you're
one "lose" short.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.450
Do I need my union rep?

10:24.541 --> 10:26.702
There's no inquisition
here, Jack.

10:26.794 --> 10:27.874
Yet.

10:29.713 --> 10:31.624
Your daughter's
pro-Liber8.

10:31.715 --> 10:33.046
How do you
think that looks?

10:33.801 --> 10:36.884
Is this the part
where I clear out
my desk again?

10:37.554 --> 10:38.964
Justbecause
I'm your oversight

10:39.056 --> 10:40.762
doesn't mean
I'm not your advocate.

10:40.891 --> 10:43.132
You know who
I'm funded by.
Intimately.

10:43.227 --> 10:46.845
Then you realize
I won't be removed
as easily as last time.

10:48.649 --> 10:50.935
I think that there's
room for cooperation.

10:51.235 --> 10:53.351
Every back
needs scratching.

10:54.112 --> 10:55.238
What did you
have in mind?

10:56.782 --> 10:57.897
Spin.

11:17.427 --> 11:19.554
I can't save
her from this.
”Can't”?

11:20.597 --> 11:22.212
Kick it over to
another department.

11:22.307 --> 11:24.389
Let Terry handle it.
He owes you.

11:24.768 --> 11:27.680
Or Brett, for that time
you took his son home
instead of the precinct.

11:27.771 --> 11:29.386
She's gonna lead
the news, Nicky.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.809
And the only thing
I can do is treat her
like any other kid.

11:31.942 --> 11:33.648
She's not!
She has to be.

11:33.735 --> 11:35.236
This will destroy
her future.

11:35.320 --> 11:36.309
She made a choice.

11:36.655 --> 11:38.361
Same way you did
five years ago.

11:38.949 --> 11:40.359
That is not what
we're talking about!

11:43.662 --> 11:44.868
You know, there was
a time when you believed

11:44.955 --> 11:45.944
in my principles.

11:46.498 --> 11:48.409
There was a time
you believed in them, too.

11:48.709 --> 11:49.789
Istill do.

11:51.628 --> 11:53.960
Chrissy will be
held accountable.

11:58.010 --> 11:59.090
ALEC: And while we’re at it,
I’d like to create

11:59.177 --> 12:02.544
a two-stage authentication
protocol for any
future changes.

12:02.639 --> 12:04.254
Sure, I can hold.

12:16.987 --> 12:20.104
Ooh! Wardrobe upgrade, I see.

12:20.616 --> 12:21.605
Sharp.

12:22.159 --> 12:23.820
I'm evolving.

12:23.911 --> 12:25.242
You did great with
that board, kid.

12:25.329 --> 12:27.661
You held your own
against the vipers.

12:27.748 --> 12:30.239
Now you need to
bring in a mongoose.

12:31.168 --> 12:32.624
Last time,
it was a shark.

12:32.711 --> 12:36.203
Whatever. Someone who can
strike on your behalf.

12:36.298 --> 12:38.289
If that happens
to be me...

12:39.426 --> 12:43.920
Uh, well, the thing is,
while things settle down
with the board,

12:44.014 --> 12:47.131
we're in a bit
of a hiring freeze.

12:48.977 --> 12:50.183
(LAUGHS)

12:52.356 --> 12:53.641
Now, you may remember

12:54.483 --> 12:56.144
I rescued you
from a menial job

12:56.234 --> 12:58.441
at a retail store
not too long ago.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.695
I gave you back
your destiny.

13:11.541 --> 13:13.042
We had a deal.

13:14.544 --> 13:15.795
And this wasn't it.

13:15.879 --> 13:17.585
Oh, come on.

13:17.673 --> 13:20.255
You'll find another
tech-savvy kid
to profit by.

13:22.219 --> 13:24.551
We both know that
I'm not unique.

13:25.722 --> 13:27.678
You're kidding me?

13:27.766 --> 13:30.473
You're the damn
architect of the future.

13:34.815 --> 13:36.055
As far as SadTech goes,

13:36.149 --> 13:38.265
I'm prepared to offer you
a reasonable settlement.

13:38.819 --> 13:40.400
You're prepared.

13:43.073 --> 13:44.062
You're prepared!

13:44.616 --> 13:46.231
You were a good teacher.

13:47.494 --> 13:48.574
Wow.

13:50.038 --> 13:52.495
Oh, this is not
how it ends.

13:52.833 --> 13:54.619
Well, let me know when
you find an alternative.

13:54.710 --> 13:56.951
You've been reading
that book on, uh, on,
on management.

13:57.045 --> 13:58.034
What's the name?

13:58.130 --> 13:59.495
I haven't...

13:59.589 --> 14:01.375
No, no questions where
a statement will do,

14:01.466 --> 14:02.967
roll over your enemies
with legal prep...

14:03.051 --> 14:05.758
Hell, you,
you know the author.

14:06.805 --> 14:08.045
I don't.

14:08.765 --> 14:10.266
It's you, kid.

14:12.060 --> 14:13.300
It's you.

14:33.415 --> 14:35.906
I'm glad your department
offered me this opportunity.

14:36.001 --> 14:38.663
You're a take-charge guy
and we definitely need
more of those,

14:38.754 --> 14:40.369
especially with our
revolving door of mayors.

14:40.464 --> 14:42.000
It's like the seven
dwarfs lately.

14:42.090 --> 14:44.547
Yeah, Happy and
Dopey are dead.

14:44.634 --> 14:46.090
I think Grumpy's
in charge now.

14:46.553 --> 14:47.713
Funny! That's a bonus.

14:49.848 --> 14:52.089
And don't worry,
we'll go easy.

14:52.809 --> 14:53.969

Miss Bolton.

14:54.061 --> 14:55.050
You don't do easy.

Don't let Nigel
interrupt you,

14:57.481 --> 14:58.971
he can be
insufferable at times.

14:59.649 --> 15:02.106
But my producer says
I have to stop cutting
him off so much

15:02.194 --> 15:04.901
because... I don't know.
The patriarchy.

be treated just
like any other kid.

15:17.584 --> 15:18.915
Nigel, can you
believe this?

15:19.002 --> 15:20.742
No, absolutely not.

15:20.837 --> 15:24.125
Inspector Dillon is
answerable only to
his corporate overlords,

15:24.216 --> 15:26.582
certainly not the people
and not the city.

15:26.676 --> 15:28.928
This is about who my
daughter answers to.

15:29.012 --> 15:31.424
It's a serious offense
and she will be
held accountable.

15:31.515 --> 15:32.721
A first offense?

understand wanting
to use whatever

Diana, I don't get
to be any parent.

My accountability is 24/7.

15:39.439 --> 15:42.397
And, unfortunately
for my daughter, by
association, hers is too.

15:42.484 --> 15:44.725
Under your accountability,
we've had scandals,

15:44.820 --> 15:46.776
police cover-ups and
two dead mayors.

15:46.863 --> 15:49.275
Inspector, tell us,
how would your
daughter's situation

15:49.366 --> 15:51.106
play out different
ifyou weren't a cop?

15:51.201 --> 15:52.907
If I wasn't a cop?

15:52.994 --> 15:54.245
There wouldn't be
a story, would there?

15:54.538 --> 15:55.948
So you're gonna
let the system

take care of your
miscreant daughter?

15:58.083 --> 16:00.290
That's how the justice
system works, yes.

in the face.

Are you a fascist,
Inspector?

16:14.432 --> 16:16.844
According to Nigel,
I'm a corporate lackey.

contradictory to me.

but they had to know

16:57.100 --> 16:59.432
it would be virtually
impossible to get out.

17:01.146 --> 17:04.354
Your contact's gone quiet.
Can we still do
this without her?

17:04.441 --> 17:06.432
Trust me,
I'll find a way.

Okay, we've got 30 minutes
to give them access

to the station's satellite
network or they start
killing hostages.

18:28.358 --> 18:30.144

make a public address.

18:30.235 --> 18:31.441
It doesn't make sense.

In the past, when
Kagame and Lucas
wanted to reach people,

18:34.155 --> 18:35.531
they simply hacked in.

18:35.740 --> 18:38.322

expose themselves like this?

18:38.410 --> 18:39.900

gonna let them

24:38.936 --> 24:41.643
So you're perfectly
content with being
accomplices to murder?

24:42.899 --> 24:45.311
That is Fermitas'
business, isn't it?

24:45.985 --> 24:47.100
I don't want to
waste your time.

24:49.364 --> 24:53.198
Liber8 emptied at least
one Fermitas safety
deposit box.

24:53.660 --> 24:56.493
This could be an opportunity
for you to retrieve
that information.

24:56.579 --> 25:00.163
Otherwise, Liber8 still has

25:00.249 --> 25:02.991
whatever it is that you lost,

25:03.086 --> 25:04.246
and they will use it.

25:09.634 --> 25:11.545
It's like baiting a hook.

25:16.432 --> 25:18.013
(PAINFUL GROANS)

25:29.904 --> 25:30.893

25:38.329 --> 25:41.036
You keep me as collateral
and everybody else walks.

25:47.046 --> 25:48.286
No deal.

25:57.515 --> 25:59.847
What do you think
happens next, Inspector?

26:07.608 --> 26:09.144
(PHONE RINGING)

26:14.115 --> 26:15.525
CARLOS: What’s happening,
Travis?

26:15.616 --> 26:17.743
Nothing good.
The satellite.

26:17.827 --> 26:19.408
You have access.

26:19.495 --> 26:21.486
Transponder codes are
being fed to you now.

26:24.625 --> 26:26.581
Live to lie another day.

26:39.348 --> 26:40.804
You okay?

26:40.892 --> 26:42.132
No, I'm not.

26:42.810 --> 26:45.222
I even feel
badly for Nigel.

26:45.313 --> 26:46.723
That's how I know
I'm a wreck.

26:47.857 --> 26:50.769
Good to go.
Re-tasking the satellite
will take 20 minutes.

26:59.285 --> 27:02.027
WOMAN: Okay. We're live
in three, two...

27:05.875 --> 27:08.457
Most of you think
you know me.

27:08.544 --> 27:11.456
Travis Verta. Liber8.

27:11.547 --> 27:14.289
Killer. Terrorist.

27:14.383 --> 27:15.998
Lunatic.

27:16.093 --> 27:19.176
And now here I am,
interrupting your
programming.

27:20.598 --> 27:23.715
But some programming
needs to be interrupted.

27:24.727 --> 27:27.639
Companies we used
to own, own us.

27:28.940 --> 27:32.228
Governments that used
to be voted in, are bought.

27:32.318 --> 27:36.027
And our supposed/y
free press who could
expose a// this

27:36.113 --> 27:39.025
are now owned by these
very corporations.

27:40.701 --> 27:43.488
Our children ’s lives
are at stake.

27:44.580 --> 27:46.491
The future is coming.

27:46.582 --> 27:48.994
It wants only one
thing from them.

27:49.085 --> 27:50.074
Obedience.

27:50.169 --> 27:51.249
ALEC: That doesn’t
look good.

27:51.337 --> 27:52.372
TRAVIS: And how're they
gonna get this?

27:52.463 --> 27:56.502
It's not. Lucas added
some 2077 into the equation.

27:56.592 --> 27:57.923
Alec, your timing
couldn't be better.

27:58.010 --> 28:01.719
Can you have the SadTech
servers run an IED bomb
search, wiring schematics...

28:02.765 --> 28:04.221
I'm in my office at Piron.

28:07.645 --> 28:09.510
Of course.
Of course you are.

28:09.605 --> 28:11.220
You thought I was
other me, didn't you?

28:13.526 --> 28:14.515
You knew.

28:15.152 --> 28:17.404
I was hoping you
didn't, but...

28:18.197 --> 28:19.653
I wish I was surprised.

28:19.740 --> 28:22.152
Alec, I needed
to protect you,

28:22.243 --> 28:23.528
and I thought this
was the best...

28:23.619 --> 28:25.120
Everyone's trying
to protect me,

28:25.204 --> 28:27.786
but you scratch that
protection and it's
self-interest underneath.

28:27.874 --> 28:29.364
Alec, I trust you.

28:29.458 --> 28:30.447
I know you.

28:30.751 --> 28:32.287
The other one betrayed me.

28:32.378 --> 28:33.367
How?

28:34.171 --> 28:36.036
Iwant to make it up
to you, and Iwill.

28:36.132 --> 28:38.043
But right now, people's
lives are at stake.

28:38.134 --> 28:39.249
I thought we were friends,

28:39.343 --> 28:41.208
but I guess we were
just business.

28:41.304 --> 28:43.636
But that’s okay,
I’m learning a lot
in business.

28:43.723 --> 28:44.712
No.

28:45.308 --> 28:48.345
No, Alec, itwas never
business. Never.

28:48.436 --> 28:49.425
Well, it is now.

28:49.937 --> 28:52.553
You know, once a
partner betrays you
there's only two choices.

28:53.149 --> 28:55.435
Buy them out,
or shut them down.

28:55.860 --> 28:56.895
I'm sorry.

29:00.281 --> 29:01.566
Wha... What?

29:01.657 --> 29:03.193
Good-bye, Kiera.

29:03.284 --> 29:05.650
No, Alec. Alec?

29:16.839 --> 29:18.249
Whoa, leave it alone.

29:20.635 --> 29:24.173
What is it?
It's just something
I'm working on for Kiera.

29:25.848 --> 29:27.839
I could use one of those.

29:31.312 --> 29:32.973
I thought whiskey
wasn't your thing.

29:33.773 --> 29:35.013
Yeah, I'm evolving.

29:37.068 --> 29:38.729
(SNICKERS)

29:39.946 --> 29:42.938
I'm experiencing some

29:46.911 --> 29:49.823

Déja vu how?

29:51.791 --> 29:53.201
Come on, kid.
It's me.

29:54.043 --> 29:56.204
My vision's better
than 20/20.

29:56.879 --> 29:58.995
Even when I am
seeing double.

30:01.342 --> 30:03.674
Did you even have a plan?

30:03.761 --> 30:05.092
Chronologically speaking.

30:06.430 --> 30:09.888
You're a time-traveler, kid.
You scaled Everest.

30:10.351 --> 30:12.512
Explored the
Marianas Trench.

30:12.603 --> 30:15.891
One giant step for mankind.
A brave new world, and...

30:15.982 --> 30:18.439
You did it all for what?

30:18.526 --> 30:19.561
Pussy?

30:19.652 --> 30:21.017
What?

30:21.112 --> 30:23.694
I never expected you to have
any empathy or decency.

30:23.781 --> 30:25.863
Not on that timeline
or on this one.

30:25.950 --> 30:27.986
Well, that's good 'cause
you'll never be disappointed.

30:28.077 --> 30:29.112
Unlike me.

30:29.870 --> 30:31.826
You remember when we
used to have ARC?

30:31.914 --> 30:34.576
A functioning partnership?
A future?

30:35.751 --> 30:37.958
This little do-over of yours
ruined my life.

30:38.254 --> 30:39.744
Yeah, well, then it hasn't
been in vain.

30:42.508 --> 30:45.341
Nobody's life needs
to be ruined.

30:45.428 --> 30:47.419
Thatjust depends on what
you're capable of.

30:54.437 --> 30:56.678
Kid, I'm flattered.

30:58.274 --> 31:00.515
But I'm not the only one
you're dancing with.

31:01.444 --> 31:05.778
And you haven't even begun
to see Emily's do-si—do.

31:08.993 --> 31:10.073
CARLOS: He gave us the codes.

31:10.161 --> 31:12.026
BETTY: The codes might
allow for some control
of the satellite,

31:12.121 --> 31:14.533
but not outbound communication
or the downlink.

31:14.832 --> 31:17.289
Nobody is gonna see
Travis' broadcast.

31:17.376 --> 31:18.786
If he figures
that out...

31:18.878 --> 31:20.084
He'll think we played him.

31:23.466 --> 31:24.876
Your codes were bullshit,

31:24.967 --> 31:26.923
but the corpses of those
innocent people will be real.

31:27.011 --> 31:28.547
And that's on you
and your company.

me hack the codes.

routing to the satellite.

I know you can get
ahold of Lucas.

the full codes,

access now.

34:06.962 --> 34:08.247
Is this another trick?

No.

What that means is that
our every utterance

35:02.851 --> 35:05.934
becomes part of a court case
that can be used against us

36:05.414 --> 36:06.699

36:06.790 --> 36:09.827
Fermitas has been
spying on most of the
other big corporations.

36:09.918 --> 36:12.625
She's pulled a drive with a
treasure trove of espionage

36:12.713 --> 36:14.374
that should make bringing down
the Corporate Congress

36:14.465 --> 36:15.875
much easier.
Including Piron?

36:16.091 --> 36:17.706
Alec Sadler won't
know what hit him.

36:17.801 --> 36:18.836
That's what I like to hear.

36:18.927 --> 36:22.886
You'll also be happy
to know that your message
made it onto the airwaves.

Let's hope
someone's listening.

36:33.275 --> 36:35.311
Betty leaned on
someone at NASA.

36:35.402 --> 36:37.688
Liber8 unlocked one satellite
to get to another.

36:37.780 --> 36:39.190
To what end?

36:39.281 --> 36:42.193
Well, Fermitas has an isolated
server farm called Black Opal.

36:42.284 --> 36:44.491
There's no hard lines
in or out,

36:44.578 --> 36:47.035

outside world except...

36:47.122 --> 36:48.373
Via satellite.

from the world.

36:50.501 --> 36:52.617

36:54.797 --> 36:56.458
You should have come clean
about Black Opal.

Liber8 is clever.

37:02.096 --> 37:04.712
You cannot fight them unless
you know their end game.

37:04.807 --> 37:06.013
What did they get?

37:07.643 --> 37:10.476
You did a greatjob
here tonight, officers.

Maybe we should just skip
to the end when they start
calling us protectors.

saved those hostages

been for Betty.

37:34.002 --> 37:35.378

into Liber8's hands.

Yeah, he could use
a little silver lining.

38:21.091 --> 38:22.877
He got that already.

last night, Dillon and you.

Carlos Fonnegra.

38:31.768 --> 38:33.144
Yeah, men.

38:35.397 --> 38:38.560
I followed your orders
to create that diversion.

Maybe there's a little
hope for you after all.

39:31.495 --> 39:32.951
No, it's not.

39:34.623 --> 39:36.488
Dad, the course is set.

39:37.626 --> 39:39.617
So how's this
gonna work?

39:42.381 --> 39:45.088
I've used my influence to
push for a lighter sentence.

39:46.134 --> 39:48.546
Three months should do it.

39:48.637 --> 39:50.047
You sure they'll come for me?

39:50.305 --> 39:53.388
Sympathetic daughter
of the guy in charge
of catching them?

39:53.475 --> 39:54.681
You're like candy on a stick.

39:58.021 --> 40:01.309
Sweetheart, you make
Liber8 believe

40:01.400 --> 40:03.891
that you support their
cause, you get inside,

40:03.986 --> 40:06.147
and, once you're there,
we will bring them down
together.

40:08.782 --> 40:11.319
What he said on that
broadcast, I do agree
with some of it.

40:11.410 --> 40:12.820
That's good.

40:13.662 --> 40:16.153
It'll protect you
ifyou believe it.

40:17.416 --> 40:19.532
Just don't go all
Patty Hearst on me, okay?

40:19.626 --> 40:21.082
Who?

40:21.169 --> 40:22.625
(LAUGHS)

40:22.713 --> 40:24.829
I know who she is, I won't.

40:25.841 --> 40:27.706
I believe in you, Dad.

40:31.013 --> 40:32.128
Okay.

40:33.015 --> 40:34.676
I'm gonna walk
out of here now.

40:35.017 --> 40:37.349
You should really
let me have it.

40:41.189 --> 40:42.929
You son of a bitch!

40:43.025 --> 40:44.640
I hate you, you hear me?

40:45.360 --> 40:46.770
I hate you!

40:47.738 --> 40:49.319
How can you do this to me?

40:49.406 --> 40:51.067
What kind of
father are you?

40:51.158 --> 40:52.614
That's a hell of a sacrifice.

40:54.578 --> 40:56.864
Doing the right thing
doesn't come cheap.

41:01.960 --> 41:03.040
Sir?

41:06.632 --> 41:08.918
She may mean that now,

41:09.009 --> 41:11.671
but she is your child.

41:11.762 --> 41:13.423
In time,
you will get her back.

41:14.890 --> 41:16.881
What do you know about it?

41:25.609 --> 41:28.316
They'll be coming
for me soon.

41:28.403 --> 41:30.940
But I'm gonna see
you again, right?

41:34.534 --> 41:35.614
I love you, baby.

41:38.413 --> 41:40.995
But sometimes in life you've
gotta make sacrifices.

41:42.584 --> 41:45.166
But you know the good thing?

41:45.253 --> 41:46.538
We're doing this together.

41:50.175 --> 41:53.383
It’s the only way you and
Mommy can truly be safe.

42:15.867 --> 42:17.482
Loyal, after all.

42:18.954 --> 42:23.197
Do you know what we call
citizens who help us
apprehend terrorists?

42:23.291 --> 42:24.326
No?

42:25.001 --> 42:26.286
Patriots.

42:33.552 --> 42:37.136
This pin will let
everyone know

42:37.639 --> 42:40.802
how special and
loyal you truly are.

42:42.477 --> 42:44.308
It's a mark of honor.

42:48.775 --> 42:50.766
You should be very proud.

43:01.663 --> 43:02.778
(SOBBING)

43:02.873 --> 43:05.990
It's okay, baby.
It's okay.

43:07.335 --> 43:09.326
You did the right thing.

43:09.796 --> 43:10.956
You did the right thing.
