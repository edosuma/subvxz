WEBVTT

00:33.555 --> 00:34.860
AAH!

00:36.123 --> 00:39.169
HELP! AAH!

00:40.910 --> 00:43.086
OHH! AAH!

00:43.130 --> 00:44.348
UGH!

01:08.851 --> 01:10.287
PAM!

01:12.028 --> 01:13.029
PAM?

01:13.073 --> 01:16.206
OHH! OHH!

01:16.250 --> 01:17.860
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:19.818 --> 01:22.343
I THOUGHT THE WATER
WOULD REVIVE ME.

01:23.996 --> 01:25.476
I WAS WRONG.

01:27.783 --> 01:29.437
I NEED TO GET
MY STRENGTH BACK.

01:30.786 --> 01:32.004
OH!

01:44.800 --> 01:47.194
HOW'D YOU DO IT, MAMA?

01:47.237 --> 01:50.110
3 JOBS,
VOLUNTEERING AT CHURCH,

01:50.153 --> 01:51.720
RAISING ME.

01:51.763 --> 01:54.810
YOU WERE LITERALLY
EVERYTHING TO EVERYONE,

01:54.853 --> 01:56.594
AND YOU DIDN'T BREAK A SWEAT.

02:01.077 --> 02:04.254
I JUST...

02:04.298 --> 02:06.430
I CAN'T GET OUT
OF MY DAMN HEAD.

02:09.520 --> 02:11.131
WHAT AM I DOING WRONG?

02:22.359 --> 02:23.969
PRETTY SURE
IN THE REAL WORLD

02:24.013 --> 02:25.884
THIS WOULD BE
AN HR VIOLATION

02:25.928 --> 02:28.452
OF APPROPRIATE
WORKPLACE BEHAVIOR.

02:28.496 --> 02:30.019
GOOD THING IT'S NOT
THE REAL WORLD.

02:30.062 --> 02:31.760
YEAH. WELL, HURRY UP

02:31.803 --> 02:33.283
BECAUSE YOU'RE BREATHING
LIKE DARTH VADER

02:33.327 --> 02:35.067
AND MAKING ME FEEL BAD
ABOUT THAT BAGEL

02:35.111 --> 02:36.721
I HAD FOR BREAKFAST.

02:36.765 --> 02:39.028
GREAT. THEN YOU
CAN HELP.

02:46.557 --> 02:49.256
- YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT?
- NOPE.

02:49.299 --> 02:51.345
DOES RYAN KNOW?

02:51.388 --> 02:52.781
NOPE.

02:54.783 --> 02:56.872
DOES THIS HAVE SOMETHING
TO DO WITH MARQUIS JET?

03:01.093 --> 03:02.878
NEVER THOUGHT
I WOULD SEE THE JADA JET

03:02.921 --> 03:05.489
LOOK SO DEFEATED.

03:05.533 --> 03:07.143
WHEN I GOT YOUR MESSAGE,
IT SOUNDED LIKE YOU'D BEEN PUT

03:07.187 --> 03:08.362
THROUGH A WRINGER OR TWO.

03:08.405 --> 03:10.668
JOHN DIGGLE...

03:10.712 --> 03:13.628
IT'S GOOD TO SEE
YOU, OLD FRIEND.

03:13.671 --> 03:14.977
SO...

03:16.935 --> 03:20.287
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME

03:20.330 --> 03:22.289
HOW AN OLD FRIEND
CAN HELP?

03:25.074 --> 03:26.771
SUNLIGHT'S NOT WORKING.

03:28.512 --> 03:30.079
IT'S BEEN 10 YEARS,
PAM.

03:30.122 --> 03:32.037
GIVE YOURSELF
SOME TIME.

03:32.081 --> 03:36.216
TIME? I'VE HAD
NOTHING BUT TIME.

03:36.259 --> 03:37.913
NO. SOMETHING'S WRONG.

03:37.956 --> 03:40.872
MY ENERGY'S DEPLETING
SO QUICKLY.

03:40.916 --> 03:42.309
DIDN'T STOP YOU
FROM ATTACKING

03:42.352 --> 03:44.049
TWO INNOCENT
FISHERMEN.

03:46.269 --> 03:48.445
THE LAKE'S CATCH AND RELEASE.

03:48.489 --> 03:49.794
THEY WERE CREATING
AN IMBALANCE

03:49.838 --> 03:51.492
IN AN ALREADY
VULNERABLE SPECIES.

03:51.535 --> 03:54.016
OH. 10 YEARS,
AND SUDDENLY,

03:54.059 --> 03:55.670
IT'S LIKE YESTERDAY.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.587
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING
WOULD HAPPEN

03:59.630 --> 04:01.458
WHEN YOU FREED ME?

04:01.502 --> 04:03.286
I WASN'T.

04:03.330 --> 04:04.809
I GOT WRAPPED UP
IN THE MOMENT,

04:04.853 --> 04:06.507
SEEING YOU,
THE WHITE TULIP,

04:06.550 --> 04:08.248
THE MEMORIES,
THE GUILT.

04:08.291 --> 04:13.296
AH. I'M SO SORRY THAT YOU
HAD TO FEEL GUILT, RENEE,

04:13.340 --> 04:14.993
WHILE I ROTTED
FOR A DECADE

04:15.037 --> 04:17.431
WITH NO WATER,
NO SUNLIGHT,

04:17.474 --> 04:19.781
NO SOUL MATE.

04:19.824 --> 04:22.914
MUST HAVE BEEN
REALLY AWFUL FOR YOU.

04:22.958 --> 04:24.525
I AM SORRY, PAM.

04:24.568 --> 04:26.744
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO BELIEVE THAT?

04:28.616 --> 04:30.313
I NEEDED YOU...

04:30.357 --> 04:32.620
MORE THAN ANYTHING,

04:32.663 --> 04:34.535
AND YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT PUT ME THERE.

04:37.233 --> 04:39.148
I KNOW HOW TO GET
YOUR STRENGTH BACK.

04:46.895 --> 04:49.201
I COME BEARING SUSTENANCE.

04:58.776 --> 05:00.300
VERY MATURE.

05:00.343 --> 05:01.692
I WAS ABLE TO KEEP JADA
OFF OUR BACKS

05:01.736 --> 05:03.955
WHILE WE HUNT PAM ISLEY.

05:03.999 --> 05:05.827
"DEAD FISHERMAN
AT LOEB LAKE"?

05:05.870 --> 05:08.133
FOUND WITH WEEDS
TANGLED AROUND HIS LEGS.

05:08.177 --> 05:09.787
SO THIS IS HAPPENING?

05:09.831 --> 05:11.223
YOU'RE GONNA GIVE ME
THE SILENT TREATMENT

05:11.267 --> 05:12.921
FOR THE REST
OF OUR LIVES?

05:12.964 --> 05:14.488
UH, A LITTLE BUSY, SOPH.

05:14.531 --> 05:15.793
UH, YOUR GIRLFRIEND RENEE
IS ON THE LOOSE

05:15.837 --> 05:17.229
WITH AN ECOTERRORIST.

05:17.273 --> 05:18.796
SHE'S NOT
MY GIRLFRIEND.

05:18.840 --> 05:20.668
OK. UH, SO CAN WE ASSUME
THAT THE DEAD FISHERMAN

05:20.711 --> 05:22.931
IS THE O.G. IVY
AND NOT MARY

05:22.974 --> 05:25.847
CONSIDERING, HE'S,
YOU KNOW, DEAD?

05:25.890 --> 05:28.284
THERE WAS ALSO
AN UNNATURAL HORNET ATTACK

05:28.328 --> 05:29.851
REPORTED AT A PESTICIDE
FACTORY LAST NIGHT.

05:29.894 --> 05:31.069
INJURED 6 EMPLOYEES.

05:31.113 --> 05:32.680
MATCHES
WHAT I FOUND.

05:32.723 --> 05:34.377
A NEARBY DRILLING
OPERATION GOT SHUT DOWN

05:34.421 --> 05:36.248
BECAUSE OF A TIPPED
OIL RIG.

05:36.292 --> 05:38.425
OK. ALL THESE ATTACKS
ARE ENVIRONMENT-BASED.

05:38.468 --> 05:39.904
THAT'S PAM ISLEY'S M.O.

05:39.948 --> 05:41.906
I'LL TRIANGULATE
THESE SITES.

05:41.950 --> 05:44.561
EVEN IF WE DO FIND HER,
THEN WHAT?

05:44.605 --> 05:47.259
I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN
WORKING ON THAT.

05:47.303 --> 05:50.741
SO THE DARTS ARE FILLED
WITH A PARALYTIC DRUG
AND A HERBICIDE.

05:50.785 --> 05:52.656
SO IT WON'T KILL HER.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.789
IT'LL JUST SLOW DOWN
HER SYSTEM LONG ENOUGH

05:54.832 --> 05:57.748
FOR US TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO RE-CREATE
THE DESICCATION SERUM.

05:57.792 --> 05:59.750
GOOD NEWS, BAD NEWS.

06:06.235 --> 06:08.498
ALL OF THESE ATTACKS ARE
WITHIN A TWO-MILE RADIUS

06:08.542 --> 06:10.152
OF A GENERAL LOCATION.

06:10.195 --> 06:11.719
SUPPOSED TO START
WITH THE BAD NEWS.

06:11.762 --> 06:13.155
BAD NEWS IS...

06:13.198 --> 06:14.983
THIS IS THE LOCATION.

06:15.026 --> 06:16.463
THE NATIONAL PARK?

06:16.506 --> 06:17.942
WE'RE GONNA BE HUNTING
MOTHER NATURE

06:17.986 --> 06:20.423
IN THE MIDDLE
OF MOTHER NATURE?

06:20.467 --> 06:22.120
I'M DOWN IF YOU ARE.

06:22.164 --> 06:24.296
HEH. EVER WATCH
A HORROR MOVIE?

06:24.340 --> 06:25.950
WHEN BLACK PEOPLE GO
INTO THE WOODS,

06:25.994 --> 06:27.430
THEY USUALLY
DON'T COME OUT.

06:27.474 --> 06:30.694
BLACK PEOPLE NEVER
WRITE THOSE MOVIES.

06:30.738 --> 06:33.175
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE
FLIP THE SCRIPT?

06:41.401 --> 06:43.054
I HAD NO IDEA THINGS
HAD GOTTEN THIS BAD.

06:43.098 --> 06:44.665
WHEN MARQUIS WAKES UP,

06:44.708 --> 06:46.754
THERE'S NO DOUBT HE'LL
GO AFTER HIS SISTER.

06:46.797 --> 06:48.538
THAT'S WHY I
CALLED YOU.

06:54.501 --> 06:56.154
I WANT TO OFFER YOU
A JOB AS HEAD

06:56.198 --> 06:57.765
OF MY SECURITY DETAIL.

06:57.808 --> 07:00.289
YOU'D BE PROTECTING
RYAN, ME, THE COMPANY

07:00.332 --> 07:02.291
LIKE OLD TIMES EXCEPT
FRANKLIN'S NOT IN CHARGE.

07:02.334 --> 07:03.727
I AM.

07:03.771 --> 07:05.294
WELL, THEN IT'S EXACTLY
LIKE OLD TIMES.

07:10.604 --> 07:13.302
I KNOW THERE'S A WAY
TO FIX MY BOY.

07:13.345 --> 07:15.391
CALL IT HUBRIS
OR NAIVETEÃ‰

07:15.435 --> 07:17.611
OR A MOTHER'S WILL,
BUT I WILL NOT

07:17.654 --> 07:19.177
LOCK HIM UP
IN AN ARKHAM CELL

07:19.221 --> 07:20.875
FOR SOMETHING THAT
WASN'T HIS FAULT.

07:20.918 --> 07:24.618
JADA, I APPRECIATE
YOU THINKING OF ME.

07:24.661 --> 07:27.447
THANK YOU,
BUT I CAN'T ACCEPT.

07:30.885 --> 07:33.453
WHEN YOU OFFERED TO
COME BY IN PERSON,
I GOT MY HOPES UP.

07:33.496 --> 07:36.586
WELL, I JUST SO
HAPPENED TO BE IN GOTHAM
ON OTHER MATTERS.

07:36.630 --> 07:38.458
YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT
HELPING YOUR SON'S PSYCHOSIS

07:38.501 --> 07:39.894
BY GOING BACK
TO THE SOURCE?

07:39.937 --> 07:41.983
THE JOKER'S JOY BUZZER?

07:42.026 --> 07:43.985
THAT'S WHAT I'M
TRYING TO DO.

07:44.028 --> 07:47.118
EVERY NEUROLOGIST
I'VE TALKED TO SAYS

07:47.162 --> 07:49.512
THAT ANOTHER JOLT WOULD
REAWAKEN HIS EMPATHY,

07:49.556 --> 07:51.601
BUT I HAVE SPENT
MILLIONS LOOKING
FOR THE BUZZER,

07:51.645 --> 07:54.386
BUT NO ONE'S SEEN IT
SINCE THE JOKER
DISAPPEARED YEARS AGO.

07:54.430 --> 07:57.651
- IT'S GONE.
- MAYBE IT'S NOT.

07:57.694 --> 08:01.219
BEEN FOLLOWING YOUR NEWS.

08:01.263 --> 08:04.614
THE MAD HATTER,
KILLER CROC, MR. FREEZE,

08:04.658 --> 08:06.486
ALL BATMAN'S ENEMIES,

08:06.529 --> 08:08.923
AND NOW THEIR WEAPONS
JUST SHOW UP OUT OF NOWHERE?

08:08.966 --> 08:10.881
DO YOU THINK THEY'RE
PART OF SOME COLLECTION?

08:10.925 --> 08:13.449
I THINK THEY WERE, YEAH,

08:13.493 --> 08:15.277
AND SOMEHOW, THEY MADE
THEIR WAY ONTO THE STREET.

08:15.320 --> 08:17.061
AND CONSIDERING
THE JOKER WAS

08:17.105 --> 08:19.499
BATMAN'S
GREATEST ENEMY,

08:19.542 --> 08:21.979
MAYBE THE BUZZER'S
OUT THERE NOW, TOO.

08:22.023 --> 08:24.808
I HAD SOME FOLKS
OVER AT A.R.G.U.S.
LOOK INTO THIS.

08:24.852 --> 08:27.507
A FORMER POLICE OFFICER,
A RENEE MONTOYA,

08:27.550 --> 08:30.771
NOW WORKS FOR THE MAYOR'S
OFF-BOOKS ROGUES UNIT,

08:30.814 --> 08:33.600
LOOKING INTO ALL
OF THESE EVENTS.

08:33.643 --> 08:35.993
MAYBE IT'S WORTH
THE TWO OF US POPPING BY

08:36.037 --> 08:37.473
TO SAY HELLO.

08:41.303 --> 08:42.783
I READ ABOUT
THIS PHENOMENON

08:42.826 --> 08:44.567
WHERE PLANTS COMMUNICATE

08:44.611 --> 08:47.309
THROUGH ACOUSTICS
IN THE GROUND.

08:47.352 --> 08:49.964
WIND BLOWS
AT A CERTAIN FREQUENCY,

08:50.007 --> 08:52.357
FUNGI SEND
DISTRESS SIGNALS.

08:52.401 --> 08:54.185
IT'S CALLED
NATURAL NETWORKING.

08:54.229 --> 08:55.665
THAT'S KIND OF HOT.

08:57.145 --> 09:01.366
YOU...READING GLASSES ON,

09:01.410 --> 09:02.890
HEAD IN A BOOK,

09:02.933 --> 09:05.153
THINKING ABOUT FUNGI.

09:07.459 --> 09:09.592
I FIGURED THE CUTTING
BATMAN SAVED

09:09.636 --> 09:11.463
INFECTED MARY HAMILTON
FOR A REASON.

09:11.507 --> 09:14.379
HMM. MY SPORELING.

09:14.423 --> 09:16.033
YOUR WHAT?

09:16.077 --> 09:20.298
A PIECE OF ME CREATED HER
TO BRING ME BACK TO HEALTH

09:20.342 --> 09:23.737
LIKE A BATTERY
WITHOUT A PLUG.

09:23.780 --> 09:27.479
IF I CAN DRAW HER HERE,
SHE'LL REVIVE ME.

09:27.523 --> 09:30.918
WELL...LET'S HOPE
THIS WORKS THEN.

10:02.645 --> 10:04.952
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

10:04.995 --> 10:07.084
ONE TRIPLE-SHOT
FRAPPE,

10:07.128 --> 10:08.999
EXTRA SWEET CREAM

10:09.043 --> 10:13.221
AND CONVENIENTLY
FREE OF CHARGE. HEE!

10:13.264 --> 10:15.745
OH, AND I HAVE
A GIFT FOR YOU.

10:15.789 --> 10:22.012
HOW ABOUT AN ALL-INCLUSIVE
VACATION TO SANTORINI?

10:22.056 --> 10:23.666
WHY SANTORINI?

10:23.710 --> 10:27.627
UH, CUTE BIKINIS,
NONSTOP SUNSHINE,

10:27.670 --> 10:29.237
FAR, FAR AWAY FROM GOTHAM.

10:29.280 --> 10:31.500
NEED I GO ON?

10:31.543 --> 10:33.676
TCH! NOPE.

10:33.720 --> 10:35.417
AHH. BUT I'M IN CHARGE
OF THE MUSIC.

10:35.460 --> 10:37.288
I REFUSE TO LISTEN
TO A BOY BAND SING

10:37.332 --> 10:39.160
ABOUT CONDIMENTS
FOR TWO HOURS.

10:40.988 --> 10:42.511
BRAIN FREEZE.

10:44.426 --> 10:46.950
AGH. NOT A BRAIN FREEZE.

10:46.994 --> 10:49.518
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON?

10:49.561 --> 10:50.954
I HAVE NO IDEA.

10:55.263 --> 10:58.483
LOOK. I ADMIT
I ROYALLY SCREWED UP
WITH RENEE--

10:58.527 --> 11:01.791
SLEEPING WITH HER,
TRUSTING HER,

11:01.835 --> 11:04.054
DEFENDING HER,
EVERYTHING.

11:04.098 --> 11:06.013
SERIOUSLY, MY BAD,
ALL RIGHT?

11:06.056 --> 11:08.450
YEP.

11:08.493 --> 11:12.584
THAT'S IT? "YEP"?

11:12.628 --> 11:14.674
I'M TRYING TO BE
REAL WITH YOU.

11:18.590 --> 11:21.637
I APPRECIATE THAT,

11:21.681 --> 11:23.508
BUT IT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY
FROM THE FACT

11:23.552 --> 11:26.294
THAT WE ARE DRIVING
INTO THE WOODS TO
FIGHT POISON IVY,

11:26.337 --> 11:29.689
WHO RENEE FREED
AND PROBABLY TOLD
EVERYTHING TO,

11:29.732 --> 11:32.692
MY IDENTITY, OUR PLAN,
OUR VULNERABILITIES.

11:32.735 --> 11:34.171
WHOA! LOOK OUT!

11:37.000 --> 11:39.089
YOU HAVE TO HELP ME!
PLEASE!

11:39.133 --> 11:41.570
OH, MY GOD!

11:41.613 --> 11:42.876
YOU'RE OK.
WE GOT YOU.

11:42.919 --> 11:44.747
WE NEED TO GET
OUT OF HERE!

11:44.791 --> 11:46.314
- WE'RE NOT SAFE.
- WAIT. WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

11:46.357 --> 11:47.750
WHO DID THIS TO YOU?

11:57.325 --> 11:58.587
SOPHIE!

11:58.630 --> 12:00.154
CRAP!

12:17.127 --> 12:18.563
RUN!

12:35.972 --> 12:37.669
UGH!

12:37.713 --> 12:38.932
I C--I CAN'T.

12:38.975 --> 12:40.585
NO. WE HAVE TO
KEEP MOVING.

12:42.674 --> 12:44.546
COME ON, COME ON.

12:44.589 --> 12:46.287
LUKE, GUN!

12:46.330 --> 12:47.854
GUN, GUN!

12:53.773 --> 12:56.340
OK. LUKE, WE GOT TO GO.
WE GOT TO GO!

12:56.384 --> 12:57.689
LUKE, WE GOT TO GO!

12:57.733 --> 12:59.387
GUYS, THE CABIN.
LET'S GO!

13:16.230 --> 13:17.622
NOW WHAT?

13:29.199 --> 13:30.679
LUKE.

13:33.073 --> 13:34.814
LUKE!

13:36.641 --> 13:39.862
YOU WANT TO TELL US
WHAT'S GOING ON?

13:39.906 --> 13:41.342
WELL, WE JUST SAW
AN INNOCENT MAN

13:41.385 --> 13:44.693
GET IMPALED WITH A ROOT,
SO 3 GUESSES.

13:44.736 --> 13:46.434
THAT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.

13:46.477 --> 13:48.436
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

13:48.479 --> 13:50.090
HOW DO YOU NOT
GET THAT?

13:52.048 --> 13:53.658
OK. WHAT IS
THE COMMON DENOMINATOR

13:53.702 --> 13:56.879
OF ALL OF OUR PROBLEMS?

13:56.923 --> 13:58.576
THE BATWING SUIT
BREAKS HALF THE TIME

13:58.620 --> 14:00.143
BECAUSE OF ME.

14:00.187 --> 14:02.102
WE COULDN'T SAVE MARY
FROM POISON IVY

14:02.145 --> 14:04.582
BECAUSE OF ME.

14:04.626 --> 14:06.846
A FREAKING VINE SNAGGED
THE DART GUN AWAY

14:06.889 --> 14:08.499
BECAUSE OF ME.

14:10.675 --> 14:12.416
MY DAD KNEW ALL ALONG.

14:14.375 --> 14:17.595
THERE WAS ONE REASON
HE DIDN'T GIVE ME THE SUIT

14:17.639 --> 14:19.467
AND ONE REASON ONLY.

14:21.382 --> 14:23.819
I AM NOT A HERO.

14:31.218 --> 14:33.742
YOU KNOW HOW YOU'RE
ON THE JOURNEY TO
BEING A HERO?

14:35.787 --> 14:38.094
YOU FAIL.

14:38.138 --> 14:40.096
I MEAN, LOOK AT SOPHIE.

14:40.140 --> 14:42.229
ALICE AND PAM BOTH
ESCAPED ON HER WATCH,

14:42.272 --> 14:45.362
AND SHE WORKED SECURITY
FOR 5 YEARS.

14:45.406 --> 14:50.890
TRUE...AND RYAN,
THE SUPPOSED
TEAM DETECTIVE,

14:50.933 --> 14:52.935
DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE
THAT HER ROOMMATE

14:52.979 --> 14:54.197
WAS INFECTED
WITH POISON IVY

14:54.241 --> 14:55.633
UNTIL IT WAS
WAY TOO LATE.

14:55.677 --> 14:58.245
TALK ABOUT
SCREWING UP BIG TIME.

14:58.288 --> 15:01.335
- SEE? NO ONE'S PERFECT.
- HMM.

15:01.378 --> 15:02.858
YOU CAN'T SPIRAL ON US.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.773
WE NEED YOUR OBNOXIOUSLY
SUPERIOR BRAIN

15:04.816 --> 15:07.167
TO GET US OUT OF HERE.

15:07.210 --> 15:09.734
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, SHOTGUN,

15:09.778 --> 15:12.955
HANDFUL OF SHELLS,
VINEGAR, BAKING SODA,

15:12.999 --> 15:15.740
A SAW, AND A WHOLE BUNCH
OF OTHER CRAP FROM THIS CABIN.

15:15.784 --> 15:18.613
YOU THINK YOU CAN
FIGURE OUT ANOTHER
WAY TO TAKE HER DOWN?

15:27.056 --> 15:28.753
I CAN TRY.

15:40.374 --> 15:42.332
I TAKE IT YOU
DIDN'T FIND MARY.

15:44.030 --> 15:45.683
I HAD OTHER COMPANY.

15:45.727 --> 15:48.425
WHAT DID YOU DO?

15:48.469 --> 15:51.254
HOW DID BATWOMAN KNOW
WHERE I'D BE?

15:51.298 --> 15:52.952
PAM...

15:54.779 --> 15:57.130
ANSWER ME RIGHT NOW.

15:57.173 --> 15:59.132
WHAT DID YOU DO?

15:59.175 --> 16:02.048
THEY'RE FINE,

16:02.091 --> 16:03.484
BUT NOW YOU'VE GOT ME
WONDERING WHY

16:03.527 --> 16:05.007
YOU'RE SO CONCERNED.

16:05.051 --> 16:06.400
THEY'RE NOT
BAD PEOPLE.

16:06.443 --> 16:08.054
BATMAN BURIED ME ALIVE.

16:08.097 --> 16:10.186
I TOLD YOU RYAN
IS NOT BATMAN.

16:10.230 --> 16:12.232
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK
SHE'S GONNA DO TO ME?

16:12.275 --> 16:14.016
- LET ME TALK TO HER.
- AND TELL HER WHAT?

16:14.060 --> 16:15.496
THAT YOU CAN CHANGE.

16:17.933 --> 16:20.457
I'M SORRY, PAM,
FOR HURTING YOU.

16:20.501 --> 16:24.331
I WILL REGRET WHAT
I DID FOR THE REST
OF MY LIFE,

16:24.374 --> 16:27.595
BUT YOU CAN'T KEEP
GOING DOWN THIS PATH.

16:27.638 --> 16:29.597
I WANT YOU TO BE
HEALTHY AND SAFE.

16:29.640 --> 16:31.729
I WANT US TO
BE ABLE TO HEAL

16:31.773 --> 16:35.037
AND LEAVE
THIS CITY BEHIND.

16:35.081 --> 16:37.083
CAN I ALONE
BE WORTH IT?

16:40.477 --> 16:43.045
OF COURSE
YOU'RE WORTH IT.

16:51.227 --> 16:56.015
AND ONE DAY, WE WILL
LEAVE THIS CITY BEHIND US...

16:56.058 --> 16:58.452
BUT RIGHT NOW,
I NEED TO MAKE SURE

16:58.495 --> 17:00.454
NO ONE'S STANDING
IN MY WAY.

17:04.980 --> 17:07.200
STAY PUT.

17:07.243 --> 17:08.940
DON'T MOVE A MUSCLE.

17:19.603 --> 17:22.215
I'M GOING TO KILL
BATWOMAN,

17:22.258 --> 17:24.478
AND THEN WE CAN WORK
ON US.

17:30.310 --> 17:31.920
LOOKS LIKE
THE CITY DOESN'T
HAVE MUCH HOPE

17:31.963 --> 17:33.661
FOR THE ROGUES UNIT.

17:36.098 --> 17:37.621
SHE'S NOT HERE.

17:42.887 --> 17:44.846
YOU GOT A HAIRPIN
IN THAT FANCY THING?

17:49.851 --> 17:51.070
THANK YOU.

17:56.162 --> 17:57.728
GIVE ME.

18:02.037 --> 18:04.126
YOU CAN TAKE THE GIRL
OUT OF THE STREETS,

18:04.170 --> 18:06.085
BUT YOU CAN'T TAKE
THE STREETS OUT
OF THE GIRL.

18:07.695 --> 18:09.784
YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED
ONE BIT, HAVE YOU, JADA?

18:09.827 --> 18:11.046
HEH.

18:13.179 --> 18:16.007
I GOT BACK
WITH MY WIFE.

18:16.051 --> 18:17.357
LUCKY HER.

18:28.890 --> 18:30.979
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE
IN THE RIGHT PLACE.

18:33.242 --> 18:35.331
LIKE YOU SAID,

18:35.375 --> 18:37.028
THESE BELONGED TO BATMAN,

18:37.072 --> 18:38.900
THEN SOMEHOW MANAGED
TO FALL INTO THE RIVER

18:38.943 --> 18:42.686
AND INTO THE HANDS
OF WOULD-BE KILLERS.

18:42.730 --> 18:46.081
I THINK A CERTAIN HERO HAS
SOME EXPLAINING TO DO.

18:52.218 --> 18:53.697
GREAT.

18:53.741 --> 18:55.830
I FEEL BETTER
SINCE WE TURNED.

18:55.873 --> 18:58.267
OK. GOOD. YEAH.

18:58.311 --> 19:00.748
SANTORINI,
HERE WE COME.

19:02.576 --> 19:06.014
UGH! AGH!

19:06.057 --> 19:08.669
OK. ATTACK.
TURN BACK.

19:08.712 --> 19:10.975
COME ON. DO YOU WANT
TO RUN OUT OF GAS?

19:11.019 --> 19:14.414
ALICE...I'M SERIOUS.
STOP THE CAR.

19:14.457 --> 19:16.155
NO.

19:16.198 --> 19:19.984
- I SAID STOP!
- OH! UGH!

19:21.247 --> 19:22.987
UNH!

19:23.031 --> 19:26.513
STOP! I AM
SUPPOSED TO BE
THE CRAZY ONE!

19:26.556 --> 19:28.254
YOU'RE NOT THE ONE
WITH A BITCH
OF A MIGRAINE

19:28.297 --> 19:31.126
THAT ONLY SEEMS TO STOP
BITCHING WHEN I GO...

19:31.170 --> 19:33.084
THIS WAY!

19:33.128 --> 19:36.740
IF YOU GO THAT WAY,
YOU'LL PROBABLY DIE!

19:40.744 --> 19:42.398
THE O.G.'s BACK?

19:42.442 --> 19:44.835
SHE'S TRYING TO
DRAW YOU TO HER.

19:44.879 --> 19:48.012
- WHY?
- UH, DO I LOOK LIKE

19:48.056 --> 19:49.623
THE PRESIDENT
OF THE POISON IVY FAN CLUB?

19:49.666 --> 19:51.712
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT I DO KNOW

19:51.755 --> 19:55.237
THAT A WORLD
WITH TWO OF A KIND
NEVER ENDS WELL.

19:55.281 --> 19:57.805
WHY DON'T YOU ASK
POOR, BORING BETH KANE?

19:57.848 --> 20:00.329
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU CAN'T BECAUSE
SHE'S DEAD!

20:00.373 --> 20:04.203
OK. THEN THAT'S WHY
I'VE BEEN FEELING
THIS WAY?

20:06.596 --> 20:12.428
CLEARLY...W-W-WE HAVE
SOME SORT OF BOND,

20:12.472 --> 20:16.432
AND SHE'S CALLING OUT
TO ME.

20:16.476 --> 20:18.391
GIVE ME THE KEYS.

20:18.434 --> 20:21.089
WERE YOU NOT LISTENING
TO ANYTHING I SAID?

20:21.132 --> 20:23.309
I'M GOING, ALICE.

20:23.352 --> 20:25.485
THIS IS THE WOMAN WHO
UNLOCKED MY PROWESS

20:25.528 --> 20:28.270
AND THE REASON WHY
I'M FINALLY HAPPY.

20:28.314 --> 20:31.708
THE LEAST I CAN DO
IS GO AND SEE
WHAT SHE WANTS.

20:31.752 --> 20:32.927
PLEASE.

20:34.798 --> 20:39.368
FINE. LET'S GO MEET
YOUR MAKER.

20:42.763 --> 20:45.592
TEQUILA?

20:45.635 --> 20:47.028
IS THIS THE PART
WHERE I SAY, "YES,"

20:47.071 --> 20:48.638
AND YOU PASS IT
TO LUKE?

20:51.162 --> 20:53.339
IT'S WHERE I THANK YOU
FOR GRABBING MY BATSUIT

20:53.382 --> 20:57.038
WHILE YOUR CAR WAS
BEING SUCKED INTO THE ABYSS.

20:57.081 --> 20:58.518
YOU'RE A BADASS.

21:01.869 --> 21:04.437
CAN I ASK YOU
SOMETHING?

21:04.480 --> 21:06.308
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM
WITH ME?

21:06.352 --> 21:09.529
HEY. I HAVEN'T BROUGHT UP
RENEE ONCE SINCE WE GOT HERE.

21:11.357 --> 21:13.707
I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT RENEE,

21:13.750 --> 21:15.796
AND YOU CAN PRETEND
ALL YOU WANT

21:15.839 --> 21:17.841
THAT OUR PROBLEMS
STARTED WHEN SHE CAME
INTO OUR LIVES,

21:17.885 --> 21:21.018
BUT IT'S BEEN LIKE THIS
SINCE THE BEGINNING.

21:21.062 --> 21:23.934
OH, YOU MEAN BACK
WHEN YOU THOUGHT I WAS
A COMMON CRIMINAL?

21:23.978 --> 21:25.719
IS THAT WHY YOU
DON'T LIKE ME?

21:25.762 --> 21:30.071
I HAVE APOLOGIZED,
I'VE CHANGED.

21:30.114 --> 21:33.335
RYAN, I LITERALLY
QUIT MY JOB IN PART

21:33.379 --> 21:34.728
BECAUSE OF THIS
RELATIONSHIP

21:34.771 --> 21:37.339
AND WHAT I LEARNED
FROM YOU.

21:37.383 --> 21:39.646
I'M TRYING, OK,

21:39.689 --> 21:41.169
BUT I'M NOT GETTING
ANYTHING IN RETURN.

21:41.212 --> 21:42.388
WHAT DO YOU WANT IN RETURN?

21:42.431 --> 21:44.085
WHAT DO YOU WANT?!

21:45.608 --> 21:48.219
- OHH.
- LOOK. NO OFFENSE,

21:48.263 --> 21:51.005
BUT, SOPHIE, I HAVE
SO MUCH GOING ON

21:51.048 --> 21:53.355
IN MY HEAD RIGHT NOW,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WANT.

21:53.399 --> 21:54.835
YOU THINK?

21:54.878 --> 21:56.358
HALF THE TIME,
I DON'T KNOW

21:56.402 --> 21:58.578
IF YOU LIKE ME
OR HATE ME,

21:58.621 --> 22:00.449
AND HONESTLY, I THINK
YOU'RE JUST AFRAID.

22:00.493 --> 22:02.973
- AFRAID OF WHAT?
- OF FEELING SOMETHING REAL

22:03.017 --> 22:04.975
AND BLOWING IT.

22:05.019 --> 22:07.108
SO WHAT IS IT?

22:07.151 --> 22:08.718
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

22:12.853 --> 22:15.029
- SOPH!
- AAH! OHH!

22:27.607 --> 22:29.435
- MOVE.
- WHAT?!

22:29.478 --> 22:30.784
MOVE!

22:40.446 --> 22:42.404
SALT AND VINEGAR.

22:42.448 --> 22:44.798
WHY ARE WE WHISPERING?

22:44.841 --> 22:46.800
IMAGINE EACH
OF THE TRILLION SPORES

22:46.843 --> 22:49.629
IN THESE WOODS
AS ONE OF POISON IVY'S
SENSORY GLANDS.

22:49.672 --> 22:51.631
SHE CAN SENSE
SOUND VIBRATIONS.

22:51.674 --> 22:53.850
YEAH. SO BETWEEN
THE HAMMERING

22:53.894 --> 22:55.635
AND...THE ARGUING...

22:55.678 --> 22:57.376
WE DREW HER
RIGHT TO US.

22:59.334 --> 23:00.727
WELL, GAME ON, BITCH.

23:00.770 --> 23:02.206
LOAD UP TWO MORE OF THOSE.

23:02.250 --> 23:03.773
WE'RE GOING
ON A POISON IVY HUNT.

23:03.817 --> 23:05.122
I WISH I COULD,
BUT UNFORTUNATELY,

23:05.166 --> 23:07.516
THAT WAS THE LAST
OF THE SALT.

23:07.560 --> 23:09.605
WAIT. ACTUALLY,
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

23:09.649 --> 23:11.520
I SAW A BAG
OF ICE MELT
IN THE TRUCK

23:11.564 --> 23:13.827
IN THE DRIVEWAY.

23:13.870 --> 23:17.483
THE TRUCK IN THE DRIVEWAY
OUTSIDE, OUT THERE

23:17.526 --> 23:19.093
ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THESE WALLS?

23:19.136 --> 23:21.008
OR WE CAN JUST
STAY COOPED UP IN HERE

23:21.051 --> 23:22.749
AND SECOND-GUESS
EACH OTHER TO DEATH,

23:22.792 --> 23:24.315
SAVE PAM THE EFFORT.

23:24.359 --> 23:26.753
OK. UM, WE COULD DRAW
STRAWS TO SEE WHO GOES.

23:29.320 --> 23:32.759
I'LL SAVE US THE TROUBLE.
I'M BATWOMAN.

23:32.802 --> 23:34.195
I'LL GO.

23:45.206 --> 23:47.295
SHE'S CLOSE.

23:47.338 --> 23:49.515
I CAN FEEL
HER WARM PULL.

23:54.520 --> 23:56.435
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

23:56.478 --> 23:58.741
WELL, SHE NAMED HERSELF
POISON IVY.

23:58.785 --> 24:02.223
WHY NOT DELICATE LILAC
OR DAINTY LILY?

24:02.266 --> 24:03.920
MAYBE BECAUSE SHE'S
A MASS MURDERER!

24:03.964 --> 24:06.183
ALICE, WE ARE NOT
TIRE IRONING

24:06.227 --> 24:09.012
THE WOMAN RESPONSIBLE
FOR MY AWAKENING.

24:10.536 --> 24:12.407
LOOK. AHEM.

24:12.451 --> 24:15.062
I GET THIS WHOLE
BONE OF MY BONE,
FLESH OF MY FLESH THING

24:15.105 --> 24:17.978
THAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW,
BUT, UH, THIS ISN'T ENDING

24:18.021 --> 24:20.589
WITH THE TWO OF YOU
WINDING YOUR LITTLE
VINES TOGETHER

24:20.633 --> 24:22.373
AND MAKING
A PEACE WREATH.

24:22.417 --> 24:26.682
ARE YOU JEALOUS?
WHAT--WHAT IS
HAPPENING HERE?

24:26.726 --> 24:28.162
WHAT ARE YOU
SO WORRIED ABOUT?

24:28.205 --> 24:30.033
YOU ENDING UP DEAD!

24:34.516 --> 24:38.999
BECAUSE THE, UM,
TICKETS TO SANTORINI

24:39.042 --> 24:41.915
ARE...IN YOUR NAME,
AND IF YOU DIE,

24:41.958 --> 24:44.265
I WILL MISS OUT
ON THE SPA RETREAT, SO...

24:55.102 --> 24:57.321
WHY DO WE WORK,
ALICE?

24:57.365 --> 24:59.106
YOU KILLED MY MOM,

24:59.149 --> 25:02.196
I REPLACED YOU
IN OUR FAMILY,

25:02.239 --> 25:04.415
BUT...

25:04.459 --> 25:07.375
HERE WE ARE ON THIS
CRAZY ADVENTURE TOGETHER.

25:07.418 --> 25:11.248
HMM? WHY?

25:11.292 --> 25:14.774
PROBABLY BECAUSE YOU
MADE ME DRIVE OUT TO
"DELIVERANCE" COUNTRY.

25:17.037 --> 25:20.736
IT'S BECAUSE DESPITE
ALL OF OUR BAGGAGE,

25:20.780 --> 25:23.522
WE BOTH FOUND
THE SISTER WE
ALWAYS WANTED.

25:27.177 --> 25:29.615
I SEE THE GIRL
WHO...

25:29.658 --> 25:32.879
JUST CRAVES
HER FREEDOM,

25:32.922 --> 25:34.881
AND I LOVE THAT
YOU SUPPORT ME

25:34.924 --> 25:36.926
TO DO WHAT I WANT...

25:39.886 --> 25:41.670
AND THIS IS
WHAT I WANT.

25:45.892 --> 25:47.110
OK.

25:50.853 --> 25:52.594
I HATE TO HAVE TO PULL
THIS CARD, SIS,

25:52.638 --> 25:56.032
BUT, UM...TOUGH BEANS.
I'M OLDER.

25:56.076 --> 25:59.383
ALICE...STOP.

25:59.427 --> 26:00.907
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

26:00.950 --> 26:02.865
YOU'RE STAYING
RIGHT HERE.

26:02.909 --> 26:05.564
I'M GOING ALONE.

26:05.607 --> 26:08.044
YOU'RE NOT
GONNA STOP ME.

26:08.088 --> 26:09.568
NIGHTY NIGHT.

26:19.839 --> 26:21.580
FINALLY MAKING
YOURSELF USEFUL.

26:21.623 --> 26:23.016
WELL, THEY HAD
NO BORDEAUX

26:23.059 --> 26:25.148
IN THAT MINI FRIDGE
OVER THERE.

26:25.192 --> 26:27.760
LET'S SEE IF SHE HAS
AN OPENER ROUND HERE.

26:33.940 --> 26:35.594
SO HOW'D SHE FIND YOU?

26:38.814 --> 26:40.555
YOUR DAUGHTER.

26:43.253 --> 26:45.778
DAUGHTER?

26:45.821 --> 26:48.694
I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY
HEARD HER DESCRIBED
TO ME THAT WAY.

26:48.737 --> 26:50.652
WELL, IF YOU DON'T
MIND ME ASKING,

26:50.696 --> 26:52.175
WHAT'S KEEPING YOU
FROM TREATING HER
THAT WAY?

26:55.962 --> 26:57.703
LOOK AT ME, JOHN.

26:57.746 --> 26:59.705
I JUST BROKE
INTO CITY HALL

26:59.748 --> 27:01.794
TO FIND A WAY TO KEEP
MY SON FROM BECOMING

27:01.837 --> 27:04.492
ANOTHER MONSTER
ON A CORK BOARD.

27:04.535 --> 27:06.407
THE CLOSER I GET TO RYAN,

27:06.450 --> 27:08.975
THE FASTER SHE BECOMES
A POTENTIAL VICTIM.

27:09.018 --> 27:10.716
AND YET YOU SMILED
JUST NOW

27:10.759 --> 27:12.239
WHEN I BROUGHT UP
HER NAME.

27:19.725 --> 27:24.643
I ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW
HOW SHE FOUND ME, BUT...

27:27.297 --> 27:30.605
MAYBE THERE'S A PART
OF ME THAT'S HAPPY
THAT SHE DID.

27:30.649 --> 27:33.477
WELL, MAYBE--
HEAR ME OUT HERE--

27:33.521 --> 27:36.393
JUST MAYBE IF YOU
DROPPED YOUR GUARD

27:36.437 --> 27:38.700
FOR A MINUTE
AND OPENED YOURSELF UP

27:38.744 --> 27:40.702
TO OTHER POSSIBILITIES,

27:40.746 --> 27:42.878
THAT THING YOU
THOUGHT WOULD BE
YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE

27:42.922 --> 27:45.925
MIGHT JUST BE THE BEST
THING THAT EVER
HAPPENED TO YOU, JADA.

28:14.823 --> 28:17.652
FORGET THAT BEER, JOHN.

28:17.696 --> 28:20.220
WE'RE GONNA NEED
THAT BORDEAUX AFTER ALL.

28:24.137 --> 28:25.791
WE'RE CELEBRATING.

28:50.293 --> 28:53.601
HEY. WHERE'S PAM?

28:53.644 --> 28:55.821
I CAN'T LET YOU FIND HER.

29:30.594 --> 29:31.857
GOOD LUCK.

30:01.800 --> 30:05.064
HERE I AM TRYING TO TEACH
YOU AN IMPORTANT LIFE SKILL,

30:05.107 --> 30:06.848
AND YOU'RE MORE
INTERESTED IN MY PHONE.

30:06.892 --> 30:09.677
MOMMY SAID WE HAVE TO
MAKE MEM-OH-WEES.

30:09.720 --> 30:12.593
MEMORIES, BUD,
BUT YOUR MOTHER
IS RIGHT--

30:12.636 --> 30:15.726
AHH--AS ALWAYS. HEH.

30:15.770 --> 30:17.859
HEY.

30:17.903 --> 30:19.556
STAY WHERE YOU ARE.

30:25.911 --> 30:28.739
OH.

30:28.783 --> 30:32.178
HEY. HEY. HELLO?

30:32.221 --> 30:33.701
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED
TO YOU, GIRL?

30:33.744 --> 30:35.964
- GET AWAY FROM ME!
- WHOA, WHOA!

30:36.008 --> 30:37.270
AAH!

30:39.576 --> 30:41.100
DAD!

30:59.161 --> 31:00.510
WHAT IS SHE
DOING?

31:00.554 --> 31:02.382
HER DAMN ARMS
AREN'T LONG ENOUGH.

31:02.425 --> 31:04.079
RYAN, ON COMMS:
I CAN HEAR YOU.

31:26.580 --> 31:28.103
I CAN'T WATCH.

31:41.900 --> 31:43.118
IF YOU COULD
GRAB BOTH,

31:43.162 --> 31:44.163
THAT'D BE EVEN BETTER.

31:44.206 --> 31:45.338
YOU GRAB BOTH.

31:45.381 --> 31:46.948
OK. ONE IT IS.

31:49.951 --> 31:52.432
WHAT IN THE ACTUAL
HELL?

31:56.740 --> 31:59.134
BATWOMAN, HELP!

31:59.178 --> 32:00.788
OH, MY GOD.

32:04.313 --> 32:05.706
RUN!

32:07.708 --> 32:09.753
OHH!

32:16.717 --> 32:18.893
LUKE, GET READY TO RUN.

32:18.937 --> 32:20.721
- SOPHIE, I NEED YOU!
- TALK TO ME.

32:20.764 --> 32:22.288
- BLOW UP THE TRUCK.
- WHAT?!

32:22.331 --> 32:24.116
YOU ASKED ME
WHAT I WANTED.

32:24.159 --> 32:26.466
BLOW UP THE TRUCK.
THE SUIT WILL PROTECT ME.

32:26.509 --> 32:27.728
WE DON'T KNOW THAT.

32:27.771 --> 32:29.121
BLOW UP THE DAMN TRUCK!

32:29.164 --> 32:30.426
HOW THE HELL AM I
SUPPOSED TO--

32:30.470 --> 32:32.037
SHOOT IT, HOTSHOT!

32:45.659 --> 32:48.444
HEY. HEY. YOU GOOD?

32:48.488 --> 32:50.055
YOU SAVED ME.

33:00.021 --> 33:02.981
HERE YOU GO.

33:03.024 --> 33:07.202
HEY. THE PARK RANGERS
ARE LOOKING FOR YOUR DAD,

33:07.246 --> 33:09.944
AND THEY'RE GONNA
FIND HIM, OK?

33:14.775 --> 33:18.997
SOPHIE, CHECKING IN.
ANY SIGN OF HER?

33:19.040 --> 33:22.174
RYAN. RYAN!

33:24.089 --> 33:27.135
LUKE, I FOUND HER.
SHE'S ALIVE.

33:27.179 --> 33:30.269
UGH. I'M OK. UGH.
I'M FINE.

33:32.488 --> 33:36.449
FINE? THAT'S ALL
YOU HAVE TO SAY?

33:36.492 --> 33:38.538
YOU ALMOST DIED.

33:38.581 --> 33:40.192
SHE'S TOO STRONG
FOR US.

33:40.235 --> 33:41.889
WE NEED TO MAKE IT HOME,

33:41.932 --> 33:43.369
MAKE A REPLICA
OF LUKE'S GUN,

33:43.412 --> 33:45.066
AND--AND FIND SOME MORE
OF THAT SERUM.

33:45.110 --> 33:46.589
RYAN, LOOK AT ME.

33:46.633 --> 33:48.287
NEVER PUT ME IN THAT
POSITION AGAIN.

33:48.330 --> 33:49.984
IT STOPPED HER,
DIDN'T IT?

33:50.028 --> 33:51.768
- YOU COULD HAVE DIED!
- YEAH, BUT I DIDN'T.

33:51.812 --> 33:53.074
BUT YOU COULD HAVE.

33:53.118 --> 33:54.597
OH, WELL!

33:54.641 --> 33:57.209
WHAT?! RYAN, NO.

33:57.252 --> 34:00.081
YOU DON'T GET TO
"OH, WELL" ME
AND WALK AWAY.

34:00.125 --> 34:02.257
WHAT IS GOING ON
WITH YOU?

34:02.301 --> 34:05.565
I'M FREAKING EXHAUSTED,
SOPHIE.

34:05.608 --> 34:07.610
YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT I WANT?

34:07.654 --> 34:10.309
I WANT TO SLEEP.
THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

34:10.352 --> 34:12.180
I HAVE A FAMILY
I DIDN'T ASK FOR

34:12.224 --> 34:14.008
TRYING TO DESTROY
MY CITY,

34:14.052 --> 34:16.228
MY--MY BEST FRIEND
IS OFF THE GRID

34:16.271 --> 34:18.012
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN
SO PREOCCUPIED

34:18.056 --> 34:20.928
I DIDN'T NOTICE SHE WAS
AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PERSON,

34:20.971 --> 34:25.150
AND NOW A BATMAN
SUPERVILLAIN JUST KICKED
ALL OF OUR ASSES,

34:25.193 --> 34:27.239
SO, YEAH, THE THOUGHT
OF BLOWING UP

34:27.282 --> 34:30.894
IN A FIERY EXPLOSION HONESTLY
SOUNDS LIKE A VACATION TO ME--

34:36.422 --> 34:38.380
MAYBE THAT'LL GET YOU
OUT OF YOUR HEAD.

34:40.817 --> 34:42.602
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

34:42.645 --> 34:44.952
TO LOOK FOR MY DAMN CAR.

34:52.133 --> 34:54.092
OK. THEN.

34:58.096 --> 34:59.793
A FRIEND OF MINE
TOLD ME THIS WORKED FOR HER,

34:59.836 --> 35:04.014
SO I FIGURED WHAT THE HELL?

35:04.058 --> 35:06.452
LOOK, DAD.

35:06.495 --> 35:10.064
I GET WHY YOU DON'T THINK
I'M READY TO BE BATWING

35:10.108 --> 35:13.241
BECAUSE YOU AND I
AND A WHOLE LOT

35:13.285 --> 35:14.895
OF O.R. DOCTORS KNOW
THAT I'M NOT

35:14.938 --> 35:17.811
EVEN SUPPOSED TO BE HERE
RIGHT NOW.

35:17.854 --> 35:20.596
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
IN THE GROUND NEXT TO YOU

35:20.640 --> 35:22.729
WITH A SEVERED VEIN
AND 3 RUPTURED ORGANS,

35:22.772 --> 35:27.560
BUT...THANKS TO SOME LUCKY,
IMPOSSIBLE, FREAK MIRACLE,

35:27.603 --> 35:30.432
I'M NOT.

35:30.476 --> 35:32.565
I'M STILL HERE.

35:36.177 --> 35:38.353
BUT WHAT IF...

35:40.703 --> 35:44.011
WHAT IF IT WASN'T
A FREAK MIRACLE?

35:45.882 --> 35:47.493
WHAT IF YOUR DEATH WASN'T
A TRAGEDY?

35:47.536 --> 35:49.843
WHAT IF ALL
THESE HORRIBLE THINGS

35:49.886 --> 35:53.499
THAT HAPPENED TO ME
HAPPENED FOR A REASON?

35:53.542 --> 35:57.155
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT
I'M STARTING TO THINK,

35:57.198 --> 36:00.332
AND...

36:00.375 --> 36:04.031
AS HARD AS IT IS TO SAY,

36:04.074 --> 36:05.989
I CAN'T KEEP CARING
ABOUT WHAT YOU WOULD THINK

36:06.033 --> 36:10.037
BECAUSE...DAD, I'M READY,

36:10.080 --> 36:12.387
AND I LOVE YOU,
AND I MISS YOU,

36:12.431 --> 36:13.606
BUT...

36:15.608 --> 36:17.740
I CAN'T LET YOU
HOLD ME BACK ANYMORE.

36:20.613 --> 36:22.354
YOUR FATHER
WOULD BE PROUD OF YOU.

36:25.008 --> 36:26.967
HEY. SORRY, MAN.

36:27.010 --> 36:30.013
I TRIED, BUT I CAN'T
GET IT OPEN.

36:30.057 --> 36:31.798
AW, DAMN IT.

36:31.841 --> 36:34.017
GOT THAT SAME LINE
FROM A.R.G.U.S.

36:34.061 --> 36:36.672
FIGURED I HAD
A FIGHTING CHANCE
WITH YOUR BATTECH.

36:36.716 --> 36:38.152
TO BE HONEST,
I DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE

36:38.196 --> 36:39.849
ACCESS TO OUR BEST
RESOURCES AT THE MOMENT,

36:39.893 --> 36:42.678
BUT FROM WHAT I CAN TELL,
THE TECHNOLOGY USED

36:42.722 --> 36:45.290
ON A TRANSMATTER CUBE
PROBABLY ISN'T

36:45.333 --> 36:47.161
FROM AROUND HERE,
IS IT?

36:47.205 --> 36:51.078
WHICH IS WHY I'D
APPRECIATE YOU KEEPING
THIS BETWEEN US.

36:51.121 --> 36:52.732
HOW'D YOU GET IT OPEN
LAST TIME?

36:52.775 --> 36:54.908
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

36:54.951 --> 36:57.127
IT JUST OPENED FOR ME.

36:57.171 --> 36:58.999
SO MAYBE THE KEY
TO OPENING THAT BOX

36:59.042 --> 37:02.263
ISN'T BASED ON SCIENCE,
HUMAN OR OTHERWISE.

37:02.307 --> 37:04.134
MAYBE IT'S...

37:04.178 --> 37:06.485
SOMETHING ELSE
ENTIRELY.

37:08.051 --> 37:09.401
YEAH.

37:11.577 --> 37:13.840
YEAH.

37:13.883 --> 37:15.624
NEED YOU TO DO
ONE MORE FAVOR FOR ME.

37:15.668 --> 37:18.236
- OK. WHAT'S THAT?
- GET A MESSAGE TO BATWOMAN.

37:18.279 --> 37:20.368
LET HER KNOW THAT JADA JET
FOUND A FIX.

37:20.412 --> 37:22.240
SHE'S READY TO SAVE
HER SON.

37:36.166 --> 37:38.386
SINCE WHEN IS IT DAY?

38:03.455 --> 38:04.934
HELLO. WHAT THE HELL
HAPPENED TO YOU, GIRL?

38:04.978 --> 38:07.241
- GET AWAY FROM ME!
- WHOA, WHOA!

38:09.461 --> 38:11.158
DAD!

38:25.259 --> 38:27.609
OH, LITTLE SISTER...

38:27.653 --> 38:29.307
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

38:43.451 --> 38:45.845
LET'S JUST
CALL THIS WHAT IT IS.

38:48.064 --> 38:51.372
A TOXIC RELATIONSHIP.

38:51.416 --> 38:55.115
HOW ARE YOU HERE?
I...I...

38:55.158 --> 38:57.857
PHEROMONED MY ASS?
I KNOW.

38:57.900 --> 38:59.598
I WAS THERE.

38:59.641 --> 39:01.469
WHEN I THOUGHT THERE WAS
A CHANCE I'D SEE YOU AGAIN,

39:01.513 --> 39:02.992
I CREATED A TOXIN,

39:03.036 --> 39:04.559
STARTED INGESTING
A DROP A DAY,

39:04.603 --> 39:06.431
HOPING I COULD BUILD UP
A TOLERANCE

39:06.474 --> 39:08.650
TO YOUR MIND CONTROL.

39:08.694 --> 39:10.348
I GUESS YOU COULD SAY
I WAS AFRAID YOU'D DO

39:10.391 --> 39:12.480
EXACTLY WHAT YOU
ENDED UP DOING.

39:12.524 --> 39:13.699
YOU DON'T LOVE ME.

39:13.742 --> 39:15.570
I DO LOVE YOU, PAM.

39:15.614 --> 39:18.660
I JUST DON'T LOVE YOU
THE WAY YOU WANT ME
TO LOVE YOU.

39:18.704 --> 39:20.836
THEN THAT'S NOT LOVE.

39:20.880 --> 39:23.143
IT'S JUDGMENT,

39:23.186 --> 39:25.754
AND MAYBE THIS IS
A TOXIC RELATIONSHIP.

39:25.798 --> 39:28.104
I'VE SEEN ADDICTS
WEEN THEMSELVES
OFF OF HEROIN

39:28.148 --> 39:30.280
FASTER THAN WHAT WE'RE
DOING TO EACH OTHER.

39:30.324 --> 39:32.021
WHAT DO YOU THINK
KEPT ME ALIVE

39:32.065 --> 39:34.850
FOR 10 YEARS, RENEE?

39:34.894 --> 39:37.418
I HAD NO WATER,

39:37.462 --> 39:39.420
NO SUNLIGHT,

39:39.464 --> 39:42.380
NO HUMAN CONTACT.

39:42.423 --> 39:45.426
I THOUGHT I WAS
GOING TO DIE THERE,

39:45.470 --> 39:47.689
SO WHAT SINGLE THOUGHT
DO YOU THINK

39:47.733 --> 39:50.518
I HELD ONTO FOR
EVERY WAKING MOMENT

39:50.562 --> 39:52.912
OF EVERY BRUTAL DAY?

39:56.350 --> 39:57.699
YOU.

40:00.659 --> 40:03.792
SO...IF LOVING YOU
THROUGH EVERYTHING
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH

40:03.836 --> 40:06.360
IS TOXIC, THEN FINE.

40:06.404 --> 40:11.670
WE'RE TOXIC.
WALK AWAY,

40:11.713 --> 40:15.064
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
I'LL EVER LET YOU GO.

40:27.990 --> 40:30.689
YOUR SPORELING IS
STRONGER THAN EXPECTED.

40:33.039 --> 40:34.301
ARE YOU GONNA
LET ME DO THIS

40:34.344 --> 40:36.695
OR STAND IN OUR WAY?

41:03.765 --> 41:07.247
YOU FOUND ME.

41:07.290 --> 41:09.467
NO.

41:09.510 --> 41:11.469
YOU FOUND ME.

41:41.542 --> 41:45.285
WHOA.

42:11.616 --> 42:13.531
GREG, MOVE YOUR HEAD!
