WEBVTT

00:30.489 --> 00:33.652
Right. So we're gonna tell stories.

00:34.743 --> 00:37.359
Yeah? You all got a story.

00:37.579 --> 00:40.537
Something from you,
from your heart. OK?

00:40.749 --> 00:42.785
Who's gonna go first?

00:44.253 --> 00:46.744
Anyone? No?

00:48.882 --> 00:51.669
- All right, you go first, miss.
- Oh, God. I don't...

00:51.927 --> 00:54.794
- Oh, go on, please.
- All right.

00:55.055 --> 00:58.297
Once upon a time there
was a little girl,

00:58.517 --> 01:02.351
and she lived with her mum and her dad
and brother in a small town in Wales,

01:02.563 --> 01:06.226
and she always dreamed
of becoming a princess.

01:06.483 --> 01:09.145
So when she grew up, she
ran away to the big city

01:09.319 --> 01:12.652
and she went to the
princess college.

01:12.864 --> 01:14.445
There is such a place.

01:14.658 --> 01:18.446
And she worked really, really hard,

01:18.620 --> 01:21.282
and all her dreams came true.

01:21.498 --> 01:23.705
And she kissed a lot of frogs.

01:23.875 --> 01:28.619
And, anyway, she woke up one day, and she
realised that she wasn't very happy.

01:29.464 --> 01:32.251
So she decided to
go home, to teach.

01:32.467 --> 01:36.301
- And what's the moral of the story?
- Be careful what you wish for?

01:36.471 --> 01:38.427
Yes. Yeah.

01:38.640 --> 01:41.598
Being a princess sucks.

01:41.810 --> 01:45.302
Right, come on, who's got a story?
Davy, you've got a story.

01:52.362 --> 01:54.819
OK, round two.

01:55.032 --> 01:57.114
Let's start with
artists that we love.

01:57.284 --> 02:00.947
We're gonna make a list and then we're
gonna narrow it down. So... Go on.

02:01.163 --> 02:03.700
- David Bowie.
- Bowie. What else?

02:03.915 --> 02:06.406
- Pink Floyd.
- Floyd.

02:06.585 --> 02:11.249
Led Zep. Sabbath.
Deep Purple. Rush.

02:11.465 --> 02:15.959
- ELO. ELP. Uh...
- Thank you, Hoople, that's enough.

02:16.178 --> 02:17.509
Dena.

02:17.721 --> 02:19.257
- The Ramones.
- The Ramones.

02:19.514 --> 02:23.132
- Iggy Pop.
- Iggy P. Vicki?

02:23.310 --> 02:26.143
- 10cc.
- 10cc. Stella?

02:26.313 --> 02:28.929
- Beach Boys.
- Yeah. Kenny?

02:30.442 --> 02:32.603
Slade.

02:32.819 --> 02:36.403
I'm putting it down.
Even if we cross it off.

02:37.282 --> 02:40.900
Right, in this hall, the
normal rules don't apply.

02:41.119 --> 02:43.861
Everything out there doesn't
count. Forget about it.

02:44.039 --> 02:46.576
In here, you show up on time
and you can do what you like.

02:46.792 --> 02:50.284
You can explore what you like.
Ideas, emotion, that's the idea.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.540
'Cause I wanna put on a show

02:52.798 --> 02:56.507
that William Shakespeare and
David Bowie would be proud of.

02:56.718 --> 02:58.299
And that you would be proud of,

02:58.512 --> 02:59.922
most importantly.

03:01.848 --> 03:03.804
Are you in? Yes?

03:04.017 --> 03:05.017
- Yeah.
- Yes?

03:05.268 --> 03:08.226
- Yeah. Yes.
- Yes? Kenny? Yes?

03:09.356 --> 03:13.099
- Yes, miss.
- Good. Excellent.

03:31.586 --> 03:35.920
It's a god-awful small affair

03:36.133 --> 03:40.342
To the girl with the mousy hair

03:40.554 --> 03:44.513
But her mummy is yelling, "No"

03:44.725 --> 03:49.094
And her daddy has told her to go

03:49.312 --> 03:52.930
But her friend is
nowhere to be seen

03:53.191 --> 03:54.397
Where are the others?

03:56.236 --> 03:59.774
- Where is everyone?
- It's Friday.

03:59.990 --> 04:04.279
- Well, Stella said she'd be here.
- Well, she's not, is she?

04:04.494 --> 04:06.655
- Miss, I've gotta go to training.
- What?

04:06.872 --> 04:09.955
- Rugby, miss. I got trials coming up.
- Oh, can't you wait a bit longer?

04:10.167 --> 04:14.831
- No, miss, I promised.
- Right then, go. I need you on Monday.

04:16.589 --> 04:19.878
What about me, miss?
It's Friday, I got a date.

04:21.219 --> 04:23.551
- That's very funny.
- No, miss, it's not a joke.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.880
Oh, come on, let's try it again.
Let's try it again.

04:26.099 --> 04:29.182
Now, I want you to make it very
specific. And remember the quavers.

04:29.352 --> 04:32.264
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

04:32.439 --> 04:36.728
It's a god-awful small affair

04:36.985 --> 04:40.978
To the girl with the mousy hair

04:41.198 --> 04:45.407
But her mummy is yelling, "No"

04:45.619 --> 04:49.237
And her daddy has told her to go

04:57.464 --> 05:00.501
- Miss Mae?
- Mr Thornley.

05:00.717 --> 05:03.333
- Rehearsing on a Friday? Very keen.
- Two weeks to go.

05:03.553 --> 05:04.993
- Beg your pardon?
- Two weeks to go!

05:05.055 --> 05:08.388
Oh, well. "Tempest
fugit", I suppose.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.431
Everything going all
right, is it, generally?

05:10.644 --> 05:13.325
- Yes, hunky-dory, Headmaster. I...
- Very good. It's just that I've

05:13.438 --> 05:17.226
had the odd complaint. Well,
a small delegation, actually.

05:17.442 --> 05:23.312
Um, issues of discipline came up
and a concern about language.

05:24.032 --> 05:25.738
Language? What...?

05:25.992 --> 05:27.152
Excuse me.

05:28.537 --> 05:31.119
- What fucking language?
- Hello?

05:32.290 --> 05:34.781
- Oh, shit.
- Andy Dixon.

05:34.960 --> 05:37.121
- Where are you going?
- Band practice, miss.

05:37.379 --> 05:39.180
- For the gig, Monday.
- You're supposed to be

05:39.256 --> 05:41.537
- at my rehearsals.
- I weren't in the bit you were doing,

05:41.633 --> 05:45.421
miss, I don't think. Anyway, I gotta
go, the band are waiting for me.

05:45.679 --> 05:48.136
Oh, right. Well,
where's everyone else?

05:48.932 --> 05:51.389
Down the lido, miss. It's Friday.

05:53.895 --> 05:55.556
Keep the faith, miss.

06:03.989 --> 06:06.947
"Down the lido, miss. It's Friday."

06:26.011 --> 06:29.344
- Does anyone else want ice cream?
- No, ta.

06:40.191 --> 06:41.931
You're fucking...

06:50.660 --> 06:54.869
Evan and Mandy James.
Dena Davies. Vicki Munro.

06:56.499 --> 06:59.366
- Stella Jones.
- Oh, fuck.

06:59.628 --> 07:03.587
This is a final warning. OK.
Double rehearsals Monday.

07:03.840 --> 07:06.547
Lunchtime and after school.
I want you all there on time.

07:15.352 --> 07:16.592
- Hi, Kenny.
- Wanker.

07:16.811 --> 07:18.767
Fucking wanker.

07:21.900 --> 07:25.188
- Oi, oi!
- Oi, oi, Macca. Where have you been?

07:25.362 --> 07:27.694
Killing Pakis.

07:27.906 --> 07:30.113
Oh, Kenny boy here's only
gone and given in, in't he?

07:30.325 --> 07:34.614
Going down Steady Eddie's
fucking finally. Having a chop.

07:34.829 --> 07:37.411
- Gonna be one of us, are you? Huh?
- Yeah, I'm ready. Yeah.

07:37.624 --> 07:39.910
- Yeah? Well, come on then.
- Let's do it.

07:56.059 --> 07:59.517
Martini. Cinzano.

07:59.646 --> 08:02.137
Tia Maria. Anyone?

08:02.732 --> 08:04.268
Anyone?

08:06.236 --> 08:07.897
Oh, look at that.

08:12.033 --> 08:16.868
Earth calling Tim.
Come in, Tim. Tim?

08:18.331 --> 08:21.869
- Someone's drunk everything.
- I thought you were at rehearsals.

08:22.085 --> 08:24.246
- So did I.
- Yeah, well, it is Friday, you mad cow.

08:24.462 --> 08:26.748
- You've had 'em at it all week.
- Thank you, Tim.

08:26.965 --> 08:29.166
- I thought you were on my side.
- Oh, I am, believe me.

08:29.217 --> 08:30.377
You should hear what the
rest of them are saying.

08:30.593 --> 08:33.710
- Oh, spare me the details.
- Mine was shit, by the way.

08:33.929 --> 08:36.171
- Thanks for asking.
- Oh, sorry, love. How was your day?

08:36.182 --> 08:37.638
Shit. Thanks for asking.

08:41.354 --> 08:44.517
Oh... God, that Davy
can sing, though.

08:45.692 --> 08:48.229
Yeah, and such dreamy eyes.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.895
I love it when you take
an interest in my work.

08:52.657 --> 08:55.865
I don't wanna sound like an alkie, but
I got some gin stashed in my wardrobe.

08:56.077 --> 08:59.535
Oh, gin. That's just the taste
of disappointment, innit?

08:59.748 --> 09:01.329
Well, why don't we do
something different tonight?

09:01.583 --> 09:02.948
Why don't you show me
some of your old haunts?

09:03.168 --> 09:05.454
Oh, they knocked most of them down.

09:15.013 --> 09:17.595
Not so fast, man. You've
gotta look for the bubbles.

09:17.807 --> 09:19.889
I'm trying to.
I'm trying to get it in.

09:20.101 --> 09:21.966
Dad, there's no more clean shirts.

09:22.187 --> 09:24.052
Well, your nan haven't
been round, have she?

09:24.272 --> 09:28.015
- Yeah, well, I'm going out tonight.
- Look, spray some of that Brut on it.

09:28.193 --> 09:31.481
- Always works.
- Oh, yeah. Great.

09:31.738 --> 09:36.198
- Mam would have washed one for me.
- Anyway, you can be doing

09:36.409 --> 09:38.365
your own laundry now.

09:41.039 --> 09:43.781
Look, come here.

09:43.958 --> 09:46.324
You gotta find the bubbles, see?

09:46.544 --> 09:48.910
There, there she blows.

09:49.714 --> 09:52.751
I thought you said mam would
be coming home by now.

10:03.436 --> 10:04.972
Hello. Swansea 6-5-2-7.

10:05.188 --> 10:08.055
- Stella. It's Davy.
- Oh, hi, Davy.

10:08.274 --> 10:10.981
Hiya. What are you doing?

10:11.236 --> 10:14.945
Nothing. What are you doing?

10:15.115 --> 10:18.778
Nothing. Where were
you this afternoon?

10:18.993 --> 10:21.826
Went down to the lido to cool off.

10:22.038 --> 10:24.029
You were supposed to
be in rehearsals.

10:24.249 --> 10:25.705
Yeah, on a Friday.

10:28.002 --> 10:32.120
So, uh... you still wanna
meet up tonight then?

10:32.340 --> 10:36.674
- No. I... I can't.
- Stella. Please?

10:36.886 --> 10:38.751
Look, we said we were
going to be friends.

10:40.181 --> 10:41.466
Are you seeing someone else?

10:44.561 --> 10:45.767
Stella?

10:48.189 --> 10:49.725
Fuck.

10:59.784 --> 11:02.651
- Have you heard from her?
- Oh, don't start, Mam. Right?

11:02.871 --> 11:03.951
You know I don't wanna
talk about it, right?

11:04.122 --> 11:06.955
- All right. OK.
- See you Tuesday.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.328
- All right.
- Hi, Nan.

11:09.586 --> 11:10.996
- Hiya, my old son, you all right?
- All right?

11:11.212 --> 11:12.827
- Ta-ra, love.
- Ta-ra.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.386
Hello, ladies.

11:23.349 --> 11:26.136
- Beautiful night, innit?
- It's all right.

11:26.394 --> 11:28.259
It's more beautiful
now I've seen you.

11:33.526 --> 11:37.235
- Get a load of this!
- Oi, oi, you fucking wankers!

11:37.405 --> 11:39.361
Enjoy your fucking chips.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.523
- All right, Kenny?
- All right.

11:41.743 --> 11:44.780
- Nice haircut. What are you doing?
- Nothing much.

11:45.038 --> 11:47.745
- What have you girls been doing?
- Nothing...

11:47.916 --> 11:52.580
All right, girls? Stella.
Fancy a shag?

11:52.795 --> 11:53.955
I don't think so.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.172
- You slag.
- What's on your shoulder, Kenny?

12:07.518 --> 12:08.598
Idiots.

12:12.190 --> 12:14.150
You wanna hear what Macca's
been saying about you?

12:14.943 --> 12:17.935
- I don't give a shit.
- Everyone thinks you're a poof.

12:18.112 --> 12:19.477
Fuck off, you dwarf.

12:20.657 --> 12:23.865
What's he going on about now? Hmm?

12:25.411 --> 12:29.370
Right, get the inner tube out.
Careful of the valve.

12:30.166 --> 12:34.284
- What are you going on about, Angus?
- Him. Being in a musical.

12:34.504 --> 12:37.792
- He's such a bummer, it's embarrassing.
- You're embarrassing, more like.

12:38.007 --> 12:39.713
Don't let him wind you up, son.

12:39.884 --> 12:42.876
Your Uncle Neville used
to love the dramatics.

12:43.054 --> 12:45.136
Exactly.

12:45.848 --> 12:46.848
Dad!

12:52.230 --> 12:54.596
Anyway, I thought you
were going out tonight?

12:54.857 --> 12:56.563
He's been stood up, ain't he.

13:07.370 --> 13:12.364
Our first stop is in Bogota

13:12.625 --> 13:15.367
To check Colombian fields

13:16.879 --> 13:21.748
The natives smile and pass along

13:22.010 --> 13:25.002
A sample of their yield

13:26.556 --> 13:28.968
Sweet Jamaican pipe dreams

13:29.225 --> 13:33.969
Golden Acapulco nights
Then Morocco and the East

13:34.188 --> 13:36.099
Fly by morning light

13:36.316 --> 13:40.229
We're on the train to Bangkok

13:40.403 --> 13:44.191
Aboard the Thailand Express

14:24.739 --> 14:28.778
- Thank you, Epitaph.
- Thank you, Swansea!

14:28.993 --> 14:31.951
Thank you, Munro,
that's enough now.

14:36.793 --> 14:40.706
- Mandy, your brother's a fucking poof.
- Piss off.

14:40.922 --> 14:45.507
...will present us with her
Thought For The Day. Lorraine?

14:48.012 --> 14:49.627
Silence!

14:51.599 --> 14:53.760
Miss, I'm supposed to
give you this, miss.

14:53.976 --> 14:56.683
- What is it?
- From my parents, miss.

14:56.854 --> 14:59.937
- I'm not supposed to do the show.
- What?

15:00.149 --> 15:02.105
- Sorry.
- You're Prospero.

15:02.318 --> 15:07.187
- Syd, it's two weeks away.
- I know, miss. Sorry.

15:17.792 --> 15:20.499
The Shakespeare's a bit
harder than the Bowie.

15:21.546 --> 15:25.789
- Yeah.
- I record mine on a tape

15:26.008 --> 15:28.624
and play it back
through my headphones.

15:28.845 --> 15:30.085
Maybe I'll try it.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.263
I can make you one if you want.

15:34.851 --> 15:39.311
Ah, here they are. The Epitaph
band themselves. Good gig, boys.

15:39.522 --> 15:42.935
Now I know why rock stars go off
the rails. It's the adrenaline rush.

15:43.151 --> 15:46.109
- Fucks you up.
- Hoople, you were born fucked up.

15:46.320 --> 15:47.935
He's right.

15:51.617 --> 15:54.734
- Two and two, split those with you.
- OK.

15:54.996 --> 15:58.329
- All right, Kenny?
- Yes, miss.

15:58.541 --> 16:03.456
Oh. I suppose Caliban's gonna
have to be a skinhead now, is he?

16:03.671 --> 16:05.832
- Yes, miss.
- Fucking lesbian.

16:06.048 --> 16:09.666
- What's that, sunshine?
- Fuck off. You can't touch me.

16:09.886 --> 16:12.298
- I left school.
- What are you still doing here, then?

16:12.472 --> 16:14.554
Talking to my brother, all right?

16:14.807 --> 16:18.140
I tell you what. You should probably
get some friends your own age.

16:18.352 --> 16:20.764
- Leave him alone.
- He's my brother, in't he?

16:21.022 --> 16:22.853
Aren't you, Kenny?

16:23.774 --> 16:28.268
Come on. Cheerio, lesbo.
See you later, Kenny.

16:28.488 --> 16:29.728
He's all right, miss.

16:30.698 --> 16:32.814
Do you wanna come to rehearsals?

16:35.995 --> 16:39.203
Right, just before we get there,
I just wanna remind you, at the back,

16:39.415 --> 16:42.202
you are Ariel's choir
of Martian spirits.

16:42.418 --> 16:45.410
Spirits, not elephants. Light.
You keep it light.

16:45.630 --> 16:48.997
Right, go on, get up there.
I'll be Prospero.

16:50.134 --> 16:53.592
More work? Let me remind you
of what you promised me,

16:53.804 --> 16:55.965
- which is not yet been performed.
- How now, moody?

16:56.140 --> 16:57.676
- What more can you want?
- My liberty.

16:57.892 --> 17:00.474
- Miss?
- Dena, come on, you can be Prospero.

17:00.728 --> 17:03.595
- I can't, miss. I'm banned, sorry.
- What?

17:03.856 --> 17:06.438
By the headmaster.
Plus, a week's detention.

17:07.693 --> 17:11.560
- Bugger.
- I know. Fascist.

17:12.990 --> 17:14.195
Would you stop it!

17:14.407 --> 17:15.739
- Little shit.
- Prick.

17:15.910 --> 17:17.945
- Stop it, I am warning you.
- Miss, it was him!

17:18.162 --> 17:20.904
I don't care. Just stop it.

17:21.749 --> 17:24.582
All right. Look, go from the song.

17:24.794 --> 17:27.661
Enter Ferdinand. Where's Miranda?
Come on, Stella.

17:28.673 --> 17:30.459
- Right.
- Fucking wanker.

17:30.675 --> 17:32.131
Cue us in.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.419
Where should this music be?

17:37.265 --> 17:40.507
In the air or the earth?

17:40.726 --> 17:42.591
It sounds no more.

17:43.437 --> 17:45.849
This music hath crept
by me upon the waters,

17:46.065 --> 17:50.024
allaying both my fury and my
passion with its sweet air.

17:50.236 --> 17:54.275
Thence I followed it.
Or it hath drawn me rather.

17:54.991 --> 17:56.947
But 'tis gone.

17:57.159 --> 18:00.492
No, it begins again.

18:00.705 --> 18:06.826
You're sailing softly
through the sun

18:07.003 --> 18:11.622
In a broken Stone Age dawn

18:11.841 --> 18:15.675
You fly so high

18:15.886 --> 18:20.425
I get a strange magic

18:20.600 --> 18:25.060
Oh, what a strange magic

18:25.271 --> 18:30.311
Oh, it's a strange magic

18:30.526 --> 18:35.145
Got a strange magic

18:35.406 --> 18:38.990
Got a strange magic

18:47.960 --> 18:53.876
You're walking meadows in my mind

18:54.091 --> 18:58.585
Making waves across my time

18:58.804 --> 19:03.173
Oh no, oh no

19:03.351 --> 19:07.390
I get a strange magic

19:07.605 --> 19:12.099
Oh, what a strange magic

19:12.318 --> 19:17.233
Oh, it's a strange magic

19:17.448 --> 19:21.066
Got a strange magic

19:22.370 --> 19:27.785
- Got a strange magic
- Now I'm

19:28.000 --> 19:31.709
Never gonna be the same again

19:31.921 --> 19:36.210
Now I've seen the way
it's meant to end

19:36.425 --> 19:40.714
Sweet dream Sweet dream

19:40.930 --> 19:45.219
I get a strange magic

19:45.434 --> 19:50.269
Oh, what a strange magic

19:50.523 --> 19:55.017
Oh, it's a strange magic

19:55.236 --> 19:59.855
Got a strange magic

20:00.074 --> 20:03.441
Got a strange magic

20:04.161 --> 20:06.322
It's magic

20:06.539 --> 20:07.870
It's magic

20:09.083 --> 20:10.914
It's magic

20:13.003 --> 20:15.665
Strange magic

20:15.881 --> 20:20.170
Oh, what a strange magic...

20:27.560 --> 20:29.221
- Miss Mae.
- Hm.

20:30.688 --> 20:32.679
Miss Valentine.

20:35.025 --> 20:36.811
I hope you don't mind
me speaking frankly,

20:36.986 --> 20:39.648
but some of us on the staff are a
little concerned about how much

20:39.864 --> 20:42.856
this musical is taking
of the children's time.

20:43.075 --> 20:46.192
Ah, the small delegation.

20:46.370 --> 20:48.406
And, well, since we're being frank,

20:48.622 --> 20:52.035
some indiscipline seems to be spilling
over into their more serious studies.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.617
- I mean, it's all very well you...
- Are you suggesting that what we

20:54.837 --> 20:59.797
are doing is not serious? I mean,
compared to social studies?

20:59.967 --> 21:03.050
We have made our thoughts known
to the headmaster, Miss Mae.

21:03.262 --> 21:06.129
It's as much as some of these
children can do to read and write.

21:06.348 --> 21:09.260
We'd all do well to get them through
their three R's before moving on.

21:09.477 --> 21:12.093
- Don't you agree, Mr Swinton?
- Exams must come first.

21:12.271 --> 21:14.603
It's a bit late to be
worrying about that.

21:14.857 --> 21:18.224
Half of them will be leaving here
in three weeks' time. For good.

21:18.444 --> 21:20.564
It'd be nice for them to at
least have one opportunity

21:20.654 --> 21:23.521
- for some self expression.
- Self expression doesn't butter

21:23.741 --> 21:25.857
any parsnips, Miss Mae.

21:27.953 --> 21:31.161
Parsnips? Mad cow.

21:31.373 --> 21:34.581
It's not even like it's a
proper musical, is it, eh?

21:34.794 --> 21:36.455
Don't you start, Cafferty.

21:36.712 --> 21:39.499
I suppose you'd like to see
the kids do "Oliver", again.

21:39.715 --> 21:42.673
Ah, now you're talking.
I love "Oliver", I do.

21:42.927 --> 21:45.009
Lovely story, catchy tunes. Proper.

21:45.221 --> 21:49.305
If I ever find out it was
you who put him up to it.

21:49.517 --> 21:51.473
- Who?
- Syd Jones.

21:51.685 --> 21:53.886
His parents said he wanted to
concentrate on his studies

21:53.979 --> 21:56.846
- and his rugby.
- Yeah. He's a good rugby player.

21:57.066 --> 21:59.182
It's summer, you fucker.

22:00.194 --> 22:04.153
Oi. Oi! He's got trials
coming up, right!

22:05.658 --> 22:07.398
Nice tits, though.

22:07.576 --> 22:09.282
Oh, aye.

22:27.263 --> 22:28.594
Hello?

22:30.808 --> 22:33.595
Hello. Is Mam there?

22:33.769 --> 22:37.728
No, she's not here at the moment.
Angus, is that you?

22:37.898 --> 22:41.607
- What time will she be back?
- Not sure. About six.

22:43.404 --> 22:44.644
Angus, I...

23:07.928 --> 23:11.136
- It's fucking hot.
- Hot as fuck.

23:41.795 --> 23:46.209
Oh, hello, love. I was
expecting you earlier.

23:46.425 --> 23:48.507
Your brother's upstairs.
We've got a full house.

23:48.677 --> 23:52.261
- Well, it was rehearsals.
- Oh, don't worry.

23:52.473 --> 23:56.967
Only Monday is "Merry Widows" night.
And it's my turn to provide the nibbles.

23:57.186 --> 23:59.928
Come on in. The girls would
love to see you, I'm sure.

24:00.105 --> 24:04.724
They're always asking after you.
Girls, guess who's here?

24:04.944 --> 24:07.856
That wayward daughter of mine.

24:09.156 --> 24:12.740
She's teaching now, she's given up
the acting. Isn't it lovely she's back?

24:12.993 --> 24:13.993
Yeah.

24:17.873 --> 24:18.953
Hello, love.

24:21.627 --> 24:23.083
Hey.

24:24.755 --> 24:27.212
- You met the coven then.
- Yeah.

24:27.424 --> 24:29.710
- They give you the third degree?
- Oh...

24:31.261 --> 24:35.129
I think I let 'em down on the
glamour front. You know...

24:35.349 --> 24:39.137
...coming home to teach.
Not very glittery, is it?

24:39.353 --> 24:41.435
How's the show going?

24:41.647 --> 24:45.356
Oh, I'm not sure. I think I've
bitten off more than I can chew.

24:45.567 --> 24:48.354
Nothing new there, then.
It'll be stunning.

24:48.570 --> 24:52.904
It's good, innit? She's
making a move, finally.

24:53.867 --> 24:56.904
I can't believe it's
been almost two years.

24:59.581 --> 25:01.501
I used to love coming up
here and disturbing him.

25:01.709 --> 25:02.709
Yeah.

25:07.256 --> 25:08.996
What are you gonna
do with all those?

25:09.258 --> 25:12.000
Uh... I don't know. Jumble?

25:12.219 --> 25:15.962
We can't chuck 'em.
I mean, that's...

25:16.140 --> 25:19.177
That's a whole life-time's worth
of stuff, that is. I mean...

25:19.351 --> 25:22.218
- Do you want them?
- I don't know. I'm...

25:22.354 --> 25:25.141
Why don't you take a look through
and tell me what you want

25:25.357 --> 25:26.722
and I'll drop it off.

25:36.577 --> 25:40.286
Where were you two earlier?
I was looking for you.

25:52.384 --> 25:54.090
You done?

26:05.773 --> 26:08.890
My mum and dad still shag.

26:09.109 --> 26:13.648
It's disgusting. They used to send me
to Sunday school so they could do it.

26:14.990 --> 26:19.529
But now, I don't go to Sunday school.
I gotta sit there and listen to 'em.

26:19.703 --> 26:21.694
Fuck off, Hoople.

26:23.540 --> 26:24.996
Ah, I gotta go.

26:26.001 --> 26:28.708
Why? What's wrong with you?

26:28.921 --> 26:31.754
- Oh, look, I'll come with you.
- What about me?

26:31.965 --> 26:33.796
- Fuck off.
- There's nothing wrong.

26:34.009 --> 26:36.466
I just gotta go.
It's me dad, you know.

26:36.720 --> 26:38.176
See you later.

26:42.518 --> 26:45.055
- What's wrong with him?
- It's his dad, isn't it?

26:45.270 --> 26:46.635
I've told him...

26:49.900 --> 26:51.936
...life has to go on.

27:01.995 --> 27:03.326
All right?

27:52.713 --> 27:56.171
So, as we've discussed, class
is measured by sociologists

27:56.383 --> 27:58.294
in terms of income,

27:59.219 --> 28:01.676
education and...

28:04.433 --> 28:06.048
...values.

28:09.188 --> 28:12.055
To give you an example,
I am middle class.

28:12.232 --> 28:16.020
You would be working class.
Right, any questions so far?

28:21.074 --> 28:23.235
Class dismissed.

28:26.580 --> 28:30.573
Right, human nature.
What is human nature?

28:30.792 --> 28:32.953
It's one of the central
questions of the play.

28:33.712 --> 28:35.919
What makes us tick, all of us?

28:37.049 --> 28:41.839
You think it's love? The need for love
is at the core of the human experience?

28:42.054 --> 28:44.966
You think everyone's
capable of love?

28:45.182 --> 28:48.174
Is Caliban capable of love?
Kenny, what do you think?

28:50.354 --> 28:52.185
I... I don't know, miss.

28:52.397 --> 28:55.605
- OK.
- Caliban's an outsider, like me.

28:55.817 --> 28:58.980
I mean, like Ariel.
They're both outsiders.

28:59.154 --> 29:03.272
Yeah, good. Exactly. They're
both excluded by society.

29:03.533 --> 29:06.013
People make up their mind about
Caliban because he's different.

29:06.203 --> 29:09.946
They think Caliban's a monster.
His mother was a witch.

29:10.165 --> 29:12.156
You've met Kenny's mum then, miss?

29:12.376 --> 29:14.116
- Fuck off!
- All right, all right.

29:14.336 --> 29:17.294
- You are fucking dead.
- Fuck you, Kenny.

29:17.506 --> 29:18.791
Lewis!

29:19.007 --> 29:21.373
- Lewis, sit down!
- Fucking idiot!

29:21.593 --> 29:24.175
- Don't!
- Oh, come on, Kenny.

29:24.429 --> 29:26.715
- Fucking prick.
- Kenny, please. Stop.

29:26.932 --> 29:28.547
Just piss off, miss, yeah.

29:30.811 --> 29:32.802
Stand still, Loder.

29:34.898 --> 29:36.434
Still.

29:39.111 --> 29:42.649
- Everything all right in here, Miss Mae?
- Yes. Thank you, Mr Cafferty.

29:42.823 --> 29:46.987
I can deal with my own class, thank you.
It's all part of the process.

29:47.202 --> 29:50.194
- Process?
- Yes.

29:58.422 --> 29:59.912
Thanks for that, kids.

30:00.132 --> 30:03.590
Thanks for making me look like an idiot
in front of the Incredible Bulk.

30:05.721 --> 30:07.928
Right. Come on, Kenny.

30:08.181 --> 30:10.797
Let's forget the words, let's
just do the song, all right?

30:10.976 --> 30:13.183
Anyone not involved can leave. OK?

30:18.275 --> 30:22.234
Lewis, you all right? Yes?
Kenny? Good.

30:22.404 --> 30:24.395
- After school, you fucker.
- Wanker.

30:24.573 --> 30:27.485
Just sit down and play,
please. Thank you.

30:32.331 --> 30:33.912
Piss off, boys!

30:37.210 --> 30:38.950
Lads.

30:42.632 --> 30:45.499
You leave any marks on him
and you'll be in big trouble.

30:46.345 --> 30:47.676
No towel again, Miller?

30:48.680 --> 30:51.467
- Sam, you mong, fuck off.
- Miller!

30:51.641 --> 30:54.053
Shall I slipper him, Mr Cafferty?

31:14.706 --> 31:17.448
Everybody

31:19.044 --> 31:22.832
Has been burned before

31:25.842 --> 31:31.087
Everybody knows the pain

31:34.851 --> 31:39.140
Anyone in this place

31:40.399 --> 31:44.984
Can tell you to your face

31:46.655 --> 31:50.489
Why you shouldn't

31:52.035 --> 31:55.027
Try to love someone

32:13.181 --> 32:17.515
Everybody knows

32:17.727 --> 32:21.390
It never works

32:24.484 --> 32:29.649
Everybody knows and me

32:34.411 --> 32:39.246
I know that door

32:39.458 --> 32:44.543
That shuts just before

32:44.754 --> 32:49.248
You get to the dream

32:49.468 --> 32:54.007
You see

32:59.936 --> 33:03.053
- I gotta go. Bye.
- Bye.

33:14.618 --> 33:15.618
Bye.

33:18.997 --> 33:20.612
What are you doing tonight?

33:22.459 --> 33:26.793
- Homework.
- What? Well, that's a first.

33:28.715 --> 33:31.297
Sure you don't wanna
come to Pizza Night?

33:31.510 --> 33:34.752
- That's for you college types.
- Miss Mae organises a get-together

33:34.971 --> 33:37.257
for everyone who's leaving
this year, you know.

33:38.099 --> 33:41.717
A get-together with teachers?
Sounds a bit naff.

33:45.524 --> 33:47.515
Have you been telling
people we're going out?

33:47.692 --> 33:49.683
No.

33:49.903 --> 33:53.987
That's not what I heard. Heard you
been telling people we're going out.

33:55.700 --> 33:57.986
We're friends, remember, yeah?

33:58.328 --> 34:00.068
I don't get it.

34:02.082 --> 34:04.915
You said that you loved me, Stella.

34:05.126 --> 34:07.242
Oh, look, please, come on.

34:11.424 --> 34:12.755
Fucking hell!

34:24.103 --> 34:27.346
Kenny, you gotta ignore
Lewis and Hoople.

34:27.607 --> 34:31.475
They just say stuff to wind you up,
you know. I know you can do it.

34:33.446 --> 34:35.357
Kenny, every line you get right,

34:35.532 --> 34:38.569
you gotta think "fuck off"
at the end of it.

34:38.784 --> 34:41.242
Make every line a "fuck off" to
anybody who thinks that Kenny

34:41.454 --> 34:44.617
- can't play Caliban. Got it?
- Yes, miss.

34:49.670 --> 34:51.206
Could I scrounge a fag, miss?

34:53.507 --> 34:55.248
Ah, go on.

34:59.055 --> 35:02.798
- What are your plans, Kenny?
- What, miss?

35:03.059 --> 35:05.220
When you leave at the end of
term, what are your plans?

35:05.437 --> 35:09.851
- I... I don't know. Maybe the Army.
- Kenny, you join the Army,

35:10.066 --> 35:12.057
they're gonna send you straight to
Northern Ireland. You know that, right?

35:12.319 --> 35:13.959
You understand that's
what's gonna happen?

35:13.987 --> 35:17.775
There's so many other things
that you could... Shit.

35:17.991 --> 35:20.983
He hates me. Oh, I'm fucked!

35:21.453 --> 35:23.034
Oh, God.

35:27.709 --> 35:31.122
Ah, there's free booze and pizza.

35:31.338 --> 35:32.919
Sounds a bit naff.

35:33.173 --> 35:35.630
You can't dump us. Come on, man.

35:35.842 --> 35:39.801
Uh, no, I can't. Go on, go
out and have a good night.

35:41.681 --> 35:43.421
See you, boys.

35:53.193 --> 35:56.526
Dunno why you bother. That Stella.

35:57.614 --> 36:00.196
Everyone knows she's
the school bike.

36:01.826 --> 36:05.660
Women. They all lose it,
don't they? In the end.

36:06.748 --> 36:08.864
What do you know? For fuck's sake.

36:09.084 --> 36:11.370
Mam, she lost it.

36:14.464 --> 36:16.625
You know, fuck off, Angus, right.

36:16.883 --> 36:19.483
Doing me fucking head in. You're
doing fucking everyone's head in.

36:23.807 --> 36:28.767
Fucking Stella. Fucking tart.
Just like Mam.

36:40.115 --> 36:42.697
You stupid fuck! Fuck off!

36:45.537 --> 36:49.405
Don't talk about Mam like that!
Fuck off, right!

36:58.925 --> 37:02.759
Where you going? I'm doing
sardines on toast, man.

37:08.435 --> 37:10.471
It's because they don't
think I'm a proper teacher.

37:11.354 --> 37:15.563
Any excuse for Cafferty to stitch me up.
First Syd Jones, and now this.

37:15.775 --> 37:19.518
Watch, tomorrow morning he's gonna go
straight to the head about the smoking.

37:20.530 --> 37:23.988
I don't see what's so bad.
In France, everybody smokes.

37:24.200 --> 37:27.488
Even small children. It's normal.

37:38.256 --> 37:40.622
They've been together for
three years, have they?

37:40.842 --> 37:43.379
- And she never speaks?
- We've never heard her.

37:43.595 --> 37:45.460
- Nobody has.
- What about you, miss?

37:45.680 --> 37:49.013
- You seeing anyone?
- I'm not telling you that, Daz.

37:49.225 --> 37:50.431
- Why not?
- Because I'm not.

37:50.685 --> 37:52.175
- Oh, come on.
- And anyway,

37:52.395 --> 37:55.102
it's first name terms tonight.
So you gotta call me Viv.

37:55.315 --> 37:56.680
Sorry, Viv.

37:57.734 --> 38:01.898
Hey, any chance of a top-up,
Mr Chisolm? I mean, Derek.

38:03.072 --> 38:05.438
Hey, now, lads, right.
There's school tomorrow.

38:11.790 --> 38:15.374
Turn your frown upside down, sir.

38:18.755 --> 38:22.794
Are you OK, miss? I think you
should have started eating earlier.

38:23.885 --> 38:25.625
Oh, we're busy, we're busy.

38:25.804 --> 38:27.135
I need a towel.

38:30.433 --> 38:32.765
It's the prawn salad.

38:32.977 --> 38:35.593
I'm allergic. Always happens.

38:40.235 --> 38:42.100
Oh, Dawn.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.276
Whatever happens...

38:44.447 --> 38:46.483
- ...you gotta promise me...
- Miss Vivienne.

38:46.658 --> 38:49.946
...you'll never give up the violin.

38:50.161 --> 38:53.244
- It's piano, miss.
- Yeah.

38:55.208 --> 38:56.323
Miss Mae?

38:56.543 --> 39:00.331
Viv, Vivienne. You all right?

39:13.643 --> 39:16.350
Madam Chairman,
ladies and gentlemen,

39:16.521 --> 39:21.686
I presume this is to enable us to
sweep Britain clean of socialism.

39:27.156 --> 39:31.115
I can foresee that it will become
as famous as Quentin Bell.

39:32.954 --> 39:34.444
Davy?

39:43.548 --> 39:45.084
Angus?

40:03.693 --> 40:05.684
He's just being Angus, in't he.

40:07.196 --> 40:09.107
Come on, let me speak to him.

40:09.741 --> 40:10.981
What?

40:12.368 --> 40:16.657
No, no, no, no, no, hang on. This isn't
about you and your new bloody life.

40:16.873 --> 40:20.286
I just wanted to know if you'd seen him.
I wanted to know what's happening

40:20.501 --> 40:22.412
because I've got the right.

40:23.046 --> 40:26.129
Well, it wasn't me who
bloody left, was it?!

41:00.583 --> 41:02.869
Oh, God.

41:05.588 --> 41:08.295
Smug twats.

41:08.549 --> 41:11.507
- Do they sleep in their tracksuits?
- Oh, probably.

41:14.222 --> 41:18.511
- Oh, bugger. Bugger, bugger.
- What are you going to do?

41:20.770 --> 41:22.977
Do you know, I've had an idea.

41:23.231 --> 41:25.438
Are you going to sleep with him?

41:25.650 --> 41:28.483
Oh, my God, you're so French.
Headmaster!

41:29.529 --> 41:33.113
Headmaster. Can I just
have an urgent word?

41:33.282 --> 41:35.739
- I need to talk to you about the show.
- Yes, yes, of course.

41:35.952 --> 41:37.488
Come into my office.

41:37.745 --> 41:41.283
Now the under-15s will be
playing St. Mary's tonight

41:41.499 --> 41:44.616
in the regional semi-finals,
so we wish them luck.

41:46.462 --> 41:49.169
Finally, I would like to make
an announcement regarding

41:49.382 --> 41:51.794
this year's school musical.

41:51.968 --> 41:55.802
Miss Mae's groundbreaking production
of Shakespeare's "Tempest."

41:57.265 --> 42:01.304
I'm very happy to tell you that
I have, like many of you,

42:01.477 --> 42:04.389
succumbed to Miss Mae's
persuasive powers,

42:04.564 --> 42:07.271
and agreed, reluctantly of course,

42:07.483 --> 42:10.566
to take on the role of Prospero.

42:11.863 --> 42:14.900
It will provide me with a unique
opportunity to participate

42:15.116 --> 42:18.608
in what will be, I'm sure,
a very special evening.

42:25.460 --> 42:29.544
Smoking, with a pupil?
And in a public precinct?

42:29.797 --> 42:31.913
Very sorry, Headmaster,
it won't happen again.

42:32.133 --> 42:34.169
For God's sake, woman,
do you not understand?

42:34.385 --> 42:39.755
- There have to be boundaries.
- Well, I'm not a maths teacher.

42:39.932 --> 42:42.548
I'm trying to get the
kids to explore emotion.

42:44.645 --> 42:47.978
I want 'em to feel,
when they sing a song

42:48.191 --> 42:51.308
or speak the written word, I want
them to feel emotional impact.

42:51.527 --> 42:53.813
You know, I want 'em to know what
it's like when your heart breaks.

42:54.030 --> 42:55.816
When your soul or whatever you
wanna call it, soars and...

42:56.032 --> 42:59.195
I'm very well aware of the
artistic process, Miss Mae.

42:59.410 --> 43:02.743
And, believe me, I know the
potency of cheap music.

43:02.955 --> 43:07.995
No, it is not cheap music. I'm
sorry, but they're a full orchestra.

43:08.211 --> 43:11.328
That's as may be. But there
have to be boundaries,

43:11.589 --> 43:14.797
lines that do not get crossed.

43:15.009 --> 43:17.671
As I said, I'm very sorry.
It won't happen again.

43:17.887 --> 43:19.593
Good.

43:19.847 --> 43:23.214
I'm... I'm glad we
understand each other.

43:29.816 --> 43:34.526
Now, on a more positive note.
How was the pizza evening?

43:36.239 --> 43:39.402
Great. Very successful, indeed.

43:39.992 --> 43:42.233
Good. Good.

43:42.411 --> 43:45.528
Um, uh, what time do you
want me at rehearsals?

43:45.748 --> 43:49.036
Oh. Any time after 4.30.

43:50.169 --> 43:51.169
Hm.

43:58.970 --> 44:01.211
One bag of chips, please, Mrs Wong.

44:01.472 --> 44:04.054
One bag of chips, please, as
well, Mrs Wong. Thank you.

44:07.603 --> 44:10.310
Davy. It's Stella.

44:36.048 --> 44:39.211
Oh, where the hell is Stella?

44:39.427 --> 44:43.545
Come on, let's just... let's try it
without her. I'll play Miranda.

44:43.764 --> 44:45.846
- What?
- Come on, sing with me.

44:48.477 --> 44:50.559
All right.

44:50.771 --> 44:54.889
So, I want you to forget that
you're on the stage. Right?

44:55.109 --> 44:58.977
Forget the world around you.
Just feel what you're singing.

44:59.197 --> 45:01.438
Channel your emotions.

45:01.616 --> 45:04.232
You're lost. Shipwrecked.

45:04.452 --> 45:07.569
Miranda's your salvation,
she's your destiny.

45:07.788 --> 45:10.370
This is the moment
you fall in love.

45:17.590 --> 45:21.333
I can hear so much

45:21.552 --> 45:25.261
In your sighs

45:25.473 --> 45:29.637
And I can see so much

45:29.810 --> 45:33.849
In your eyes

45:34.065 --> 45:38.058
There are words we both could say

45:42.156 --> 45:44.522
Don't talk

45:44.742 --> 45:50.453
Put your head on my shoulder

45:50.665 --> 45:52.872
Come close

45:53.084 --> 45:58.624
Close your eyes and be still

45:58.839 --> 46:01.296
Don't talk

46:01.509 --> 46:03.750
Take my hand

46:03.970 --> 46:10.182
And let me hear your heart

46:10.393 --> 46:13.510
Beat

46:16.607 --> 46:20.646
Hello, everyone. Apologies
for my tardiness.

46:20.861 --> 46:24.353
- Welcome, Headmaster.
- I thought I'd, uh, dress casual.

46:25.491 --> 46:26.606
Great.

46:26.826 --> 46:29.568
Ah, the goddess on whom
the music attends.

46:29.787 --> 46:32.995
- Sorry I'm late, miss.
- Don't worry, I did your bit for you.

46:33.207 --> 46:35.968
You're not indispensable, Stella Jones.
Just remember that. Nobody is.

46:36.085 --> 46:39.452
It won't happen again, Miss Mae.
The both of us will be punctual next time.

46:39.672 --> 46:42.163
- Won't we, Stella?
- Right, let's try it again, shall we?

46:42.383 --> 46:43.998
- From where?
- Well, the same place.

46:44.218 --> 46:47.756
If that's all right with you. When
Miranda first sets eyes on Ferdinand.

46:47.972 --> 46:50.884
- It's the moment they fall in love.
- All these songs are about love.

46:51.058 --> 46:52.719
It gets confusing.

46:53.853 --> 46:58.472
- Um, where do you want me?
- Oh, by Ariel and Iris.

47:02.528 --> 47:04.393
Well, you gotta look
into each other's eyes.

47:07.366 --> 47:11.609
Most sure, it is the goddess
on whom the music attends.

47:13.205 --> 47:17.665
O you wonder! Tell me
if you be maid or no.

47:17.877 --> 47:20.960
No wonder, sir, but
certainly a maid.

47:24.925 --> 47:28.588
I can hear so much

47:28.846 --> 47:32.555
In your sighs

47:32.767 --> 47:36.976
And I can see so much

47:37.188 --> 47:41.306
In your eyes

47:41.525 --> 47:46.565
There are words we both could say

47:49.742 --> 47:52.028
Don't talk

47:52.244 --> 47:56.829
Put your head on my shoulder

47:57.833 --> 48:00.199
Come close

48:00.419 --> 48:05.083
Close your eyes and be still

48:06.467 --> 48:08.583
Don't talk

48:08.803 --> 48:10.794
Take my hand

48:11.013 --> 48:17.179
And let me hear your heart

48:17.395 --> 48:19.681
Heart beat

48:21.065 --> 48:23.397
- Just piss off, Stella!
- Well, what's wrong now?

48:23.609 --> 48:26.942
You know exactly what's wrong.
You're just a fucking prick-tease.

48:27.196 --> 48:28.402
No, I'm not.

48:28.614 --> 48:30.855
- Miss, can I be excused?
- Yeah, go on.

48:31.033 --> 48:34.491
All right, hush. Just take a five
minute break. Right, everyone.

48:36.163 --> 48:39.872
- You gotta be more careful.
- Did you hear what he called me?

48:40.084 --> 48:41.620
Yeah, I know, that
was unnecessary...

48:41.836 --> 48:43.292
I'm not bloody singing
again with him. No way.

48:43.462 --> 48:45.999
- Come on, Stella.
- No. Forget it.

48:46.215 --> 48:48.752
He's lost the plot,
he has, big time.

48:50.886 --> 48:54.003
Um, I... you know, uh, as I said,

48:54.265 --> 48:57.632
it's... it's important that
they explore their emotions.

48:57.852 --> 49:02.186
- Explore or indulge?
- Well, it can get a bit a messy.

49:06.777 --> 49:08.358
You all right?

49:08.571 --> 49:11.153
I'm sorry, miss, I...

49:14.368 --> 49:16.700
Don't waste too much time, Davy.

49:18.664 --> 49:21.371
- What?
- On Stella.

49:25.421 --> 49:29.255
She's bloody gorgeous.
I can see that.

49:31.302 --> 49:34.794
But she might not be the one.
You ever thought of that?

49:38.642 --> 49:43.477
I don't know much, but... I know you
can't persuade someone to love you.

49:43.689 --> 49:45.975
And you can't blame
them when they don't.

49:50.112 --> 49:52.649
- Thanks, miss.
- You're welcome, Davy.

49:56.535 --> 50:02.451
Strange face, with your eyes

50:02.666 --> 50:07.831
So pale and sincere

50:08.047 --> 50:13.758
Underneath you know well

50:13.969 --> 50:19.885
You have nothing to fear

50:21.185 --> 50:25.599
For the dreams that came

50:25.856 --> 50:30.316
To you when so young

50:32.780 --> 50:37.365
Told of a life

50:37.576 --> 50:43.788
Where spring is sprung

50:54.635 --> 50:59.880
You would seem so frail

51:00.099 --> 51:05.719
In the cold of the night

51:05.938 --> 51:11.729
When the armies of emotion

51:11.944 --> 51:18.031
Go out to fight

51:19.243 --> 51:23.577
But while the earth

51:23.789 --> 51:28.374
Sinks to its grave

51:30.421 --> 51:35.256
You sail to the sky

51:35.467 --> 51:41.679
On the crest of a wave

52:22.306 --> 52:27.016
And if one day

52:27.227 --> 52:33.314
You should see me in the crowd

52:36.528 --> 52:40.567
Lend a hand and lift me

52:45.079 --> 52:48.116
To your place

52:48.290 --> 52:51.953
In the cloud

52:57.174 --> 52:59.381
Do you ever feel like an alien?

53:00.969 --> 53:04.257
Like sometimes I think I've
been stranded on this planet,

53:04.473 --> 53:08.216
and that one day they're gonna
come and pick me up. Take me back.

53:08.477 --> 53:12.265
Well, if that happens, let me know.
Maybe they'll take me with you.

53:13.107 --> 53:16.349
Let's go for a swim. To cool off.

53:16.568 --> 53:18.229
- Let's not.
- Oh, come on...

53:18.404 --> 53:21.396
Oh, yeah, let's.
Let's go down the lido.

53:36.338 --> 53:40.672
- You sure they won't be back?
- I told you. They're at my uncle's.

53:40.884 --> 53:45.002
- All night.
- What about Lewis?

53:45.222 --> 53:49.181
He thinks you're at the hospital.
He's over at Hoople's.

53:51.270 --> 53:54.808
Ah, I should go.
I wanna see my dad.

53:54.982 --> 53:56.893
Yeah, OK.

54:04.992 --> 54:07.108
I'll go see him tomorrow.

54:45.991 --> 54:47.731
Don't, you'll ruin my hair.

55:19.650 --> 55:22.938
Oh, I was starting to think
you'd run away an' all.

55:23.153 --> 55:26.065
- No, I've just been riding around.
- Oh, aye.

55:27.574 --> 55:29.064
Spoke to your mother.

55:30.410 --> 55:32.025
- All right?
- Aye.

55:32.788 --> 55:36.997
No problem. Angus is staying
over her place for a few days.

55:38.502 --> 55:40.663
Got a surprise for you boys.

55:41.255 --> 55:42.495
Come and see.

55:48.846 --> 55:52.304
- A fridge?
- Freezer. Fridge...

55:52.516 --> 55:54.848
It's not ours yet, of
course, but it will be,

55:55.102 --> 55:57.718
so I don't want any dents
or scratches, right.

56:03.652 --> 56:06.519
- What are they?
- Melon balls.

56:08.657 --> 56:12.149
Ice cream, too, and
Tip-Tops for Angus.

56:12.369 --> 56:14.655
He's always going on about
your mam's deep freeze

56:14.913 --> 56:17.245
over her bloke's in Porthcawl.

56:17.457 --> 56:21.325
- Still don't know what she sees in him.
- He's got a deep freeze, hasn't he?

56:34.766 --> 56:40.887
He's a nasty little troublemaker.
A very disruptive influence in class.

56:41.106 --> 56:44.598
Yeah, well, that wouldn't happen
on my watch, Miss Valentine.

56:44.776 --> 56:48.689
Next time, just send the
little bugger over to me.

56:48.864 --> 56:51.321
- Who are we talking about?
- Kenny Loder.

56:51.533 --> 56:54.024
His brother was just the same.

56:54.244 --> 56:56.781
You know I'm interested,
as an expert...

56:56.997 --> 57:00.160
Oh, no, wait, as a
social studies teacher.

57:00.334 --> 57:02.374
Do you think he was born
a nasty little troublemaker

57:02.544 --> 57:06.457
or did we turn him into one? 'Cause
he's doing really well for me.

57:06.632 --> 57:10.375
- He can sing, for a start.
- It won't last. Mark my words.

57:10.594 --> 57:12.630
- Biscuit fund.
- Why? Because you only have

57:12.804 --> 57:15.420
- one approach?
- Miss Mae, I believe you've already

57:15.641 --> 57:18.633
had one official warning
in your brief time here.

57:19.436 --> 57:22.394
It might pay you to
show some humility.

57:26.777 --> 57:29.735
- No, thanks, I'm on a diet.
- But you had a biscuit.

57:29.947 --> 57:32.529
- What?
- Yesterday. You had a biscuit.

57:32.699 --> 57:37.989
Actually, you had two. You had one
on Tuesday as well. Digestive.

57:44.586 --> 57:47.248
- Am I really that ugly, then?
- No.

57:47.506 --> 57:48.837
Well, what is it, then?

58:01.103 --> 58:03.719
I'm not sure it's... girls I like.

58:05.273 --> 58:08.731
What? You're.. you're a poof?

58:09.444 --> 58:13.107
I just need some
time to work it out.

58:14.449 --> 58:16.314
You've already worked
it out, I reckon.

58:16.535 --> 58:18.366
I'm not ashamed of it.

58:26.712 --> 58:29.044
I always knew you were different.

58:29.965 --> 58:32.456
That's why I liked you, I suppose.

58:32.676 --> 58:35.668
Not like the other
twats in this school.

58:41.101 --> 58:42.637
So have you told anyone else?

58:48.358 --> 58:50.349
Well, I'm glad you told me.

58:53.822 --> 58:55.437
So am I.

59:27.147 --> 59:31.060
We passed upon the stair

59:31.276 --> 59:34.643
We spoke of was and when

59:34.905 --> 59:38.693
Although I wasn't there

59:38.950 --> 59:42.534
He said I was his friend

59:42.746 --> 59:46.364
Which came as some surprise

59:46.583 --> 59:49.575
I spoke into his eyes

59:49.795 --> 59:53.379
I thought you died alone

59:53.632 --> 59:56.999
A long, long time ago

59:59.429 --> 01:00:03.092
Oh, no, not me

01:00:03.308 --> 01:00:06.971
I never lost control

01:00:07.229 --> 01:00:11.097
You're face to face

01:00:11.358 --> 01:00:15.567
With The Man Who Sold The World

01:00:29.209 --> 01:00:32.326
I laughed and shook his hand

01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:37.339
And made my way back home

01:00:37.551 --> 01:00:41.590
I searched for form and land

01:00:41.805 --> 01:00:45.093
For years and years I roamed

01:00:45.308 --> 01:00:48.800
I gazed a gazely stare

01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:51.807
At all the millions here

01:00:52.023 --> 01:00:55.686
We must have died alone

01:00:55.902 --> 01:00:59.440
A long, long time ago

01:01:01.741 --> 01:01:03.606
Who knows?

01:01:03.827 --> 01:01:05.658
Not me

01:01:05.871 --> 01:01:09.238
We never lost control

01:01:09.457 --> 01:01:13.416
You're face to face

01:01:13.628 --> 01:01:17.541
With The Man Who Sold The World

01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:28.223
Right. Prospero, Caliban.
Headmaster, you're on. Kenny.

01:01:28.476 --> 01:01:31.138
From, uh, "What ho, slave."

01:01:32.272 --> 01:01:33.387
Oh...

01:01:40.113 --> 01:01:43.230
What ho, slave! Caliban.

01:01:43.450 --> 01:01:46.692
Thou earth, thou! Fetch some wood.

01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:49.486
There's wood enough
already. Fuck off.

01:01:51.041 --> 01:01:54.499
Yeah. Think it,
don't say it, Kenny.

01:01:54.711 --> 01:01:56.702
He's improvising. He's
just working it out.

01:01:56.922 --> 01:01:59.042
I don't think the f-word has
any place in Shakespeare.

01:02:00.008 --> 01:02:03.000
Well, it's actually
very old, the f-word.

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:05.882
- It's also very offensive.
- Well, so is Caliban.

01:02:06.097 --> 01:02:09.134
- Boundaries, Miss Mae, boundaries.
- Yes, Headmaster.

01:02:09.351 --> 01:02:10.716
Carry on. Thank you.

01:02:13.188 --> 01:02:18.774
There's other business for thee,
too. Come here, tortoise.

01:02:18.985 --> 01:02:21.601
This island's mine, by...

01:02:22.614 --> 01:02:24.445
- Sycorax.
- Fuck!

01:02:24.658 --> 01:02:28.697
- It's all right, go on.
- Sycorax, my mother,

01:02:28.912 --> 01:02:30.903
which you stole from me,

01:02:31.122 --> 01:02:34.489
uh, when you came
first you stroked me.

01:02:35.710 --> 01:02:36.710
Sh! Stop!

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:40.037
Just fuck off! You're
fucking dead! And you!

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:43.336
- Pay no attention to him, please.
- Kenneth.

01:02:43.551 --> 01:02:44.586
Look, don't you get it?

01:02:44.803 --> 01:02:47.084
I never wanted to do this poxy
musical in the first place.

01:02:47.097 --> 01:02:50.089
- I know, Kenny, just come back.
- Just fuck off, miss, will you!

01:02:51.810 --> 01:02:53.596
Quiet!

01:03:21.214 --> 01:03:25.457
"Feeling both the fury and the
passion of this sweet air."

01:03:54.039 --> 01:03:57.702
Oh, hi. You look smart.

01:03:57.917 --> 01:04:00.408
I'm just on my way home from work.

01:04:01.004 --> 01:04:03.791
I was wondering if you'd fancy
going for a spin later like?

01:04:04.007 --> 01:04:06.293
- Where to?
- Anywhere you fancy.

01:04:07.135 --> 01:04:09.751
Have you ever heard of this
place called The Casablanca?

01:04:09.971 --> 01:04:13.555
- No.
- It's this club I fancied going to.

01:04:13.767 --> 01:04:17.009
Nightclub, sure. Why not?

01:04:20.315 --> 01:04:23.182
I propose a toast...

01:04:23.443 --> 01:04:28.278
...to groundbreaking, cutting-edge,
Shakespearean, concept rock operas.

01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:29.987
- Did I leave anything out?
- No, I don't think so.

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:32.782
- Good. Come on, then.
- Right.

01:04:34.245 --> 01:04:35.451
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:04:35.622 --> 01:04:36.828
Up your bum.

01:04:41.252 --> 01:04:47.339
Ah. Ah, I gained a Prospero and lost
a Caliban. It's hardly a fair swap.

01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:49.962
- Kenny might come back.
- No.

01:04:50.136 --> 01:04:53.128
I think Lord Olivier is
here to stay, though. I...

01:04:53.306 --> 01:04:55.797
"I thought I'd dress casual."

01:04:56.017 --> 01:04:58.099
He's on my side, deep down.

01:05:00.647 --> 01:05:02.308
Oh, my God, who the
hell can that be?

01:05:02.524 --> 01:05:04.185
My God, who's that? You get it.

01:05:04.401 --> 01:05:06.892
- No, I'm not going.
- I'll go.

01:05:12.325 --> 01:05:13.986
Hello?

01:05:14.411 --> 01:05:16.527
Davy. What are you doing up here?

01:05:16.746 --> 01:05:20.864
I was on my way to my nan's.
She lives over in Briton Ferry.

01:05:21.084 --> 01:05:22.369
Oh, right.

01:05:23.044 --> 01:05:28.038
It's just... I come off my bike.
I think I got a puncture.

01:05:28.258 --> 01:05:30.795
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

01:05:31.344 --> 01:05:32.629
You wanna come in?

01:05:34.139 --> 01:05:35.139
OK.

01:05:58.830 --> 01:06:01.367
...always makes me want tequila.

01:06:32.906 --> 01:06:35.818
- Looks crap.
- Come on, it sounds good.

01:07:49.399 --> 01:07:50.809
- Want a drink?
- Yes, please.

01:07:51.025 --> 01:07:53.357
- What kind of drink d'you want?
- I don't mind.

01:08:12.213 --> 01:08:14.078
- What's all these?
- American imports.

01:08:25.768 --> 01:08:29.511
There's no bar. There's no fucking bar!
What are we doing here?

01:08:29.731 --> 01:08:31.345
- It's good.
- It's not good, it's shit.

01:08:31.566 --> 01:08:32.930
- It's good.
- It's not good, it's crap.

01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:35.645
- Let's go somewhere else.
- Just leave it.

01:08:35.862 --> 01:08:38.399
- What's your fucking game?
- Get off me!

01:08:45.412 --> 01:08:48.154
- Let me give you a lift home.
- Piss off.

01:09:00.053 --> 01:09:03.545
Right. There you go.

01:09:03.765 --> 01:09:06.301
You should be quite
comfortable on that settee.

01:09:07.977 --> 01:09:09.433
Thanks.

01:09:12.023 --> 01:09:15.982
It's going to be great. The show.

01:09:16.944 --> 01:09:18.184
Yeah.

01:09:19.906 --> 01:09:23.398
Listen, are you sure you
don't wanna phone your dad?

01:09:24.618 --> 01:09:26.529
We don't have a phone.

01:09:28.997 --> 01:09:32.035
Anyway, he's working nights.

01:09:33.461 --> 01:09:36.919
OK, well, sleep tight, then.

01:09:52.479 --> 01:09:54.311
Just get lost, will you!

01:09:55.024 --> 01:09:57.640
Stella, you OK?

01:10:01.447 --> 01:10:03.312
Are you all right?

01:11:17.815 --> 01:11:18.930
Davy?

01:11:21.778 --> 01:11:22.984
You all right?

01:11:25.031 --> 01:11:26.896
- What's wrong?
- Um...

01:11:33.164 --> 01:11:34.700
Nothing.

01:12:03.569 --> 01:12:04.900
School tomorrow.

01:13:00.042 --> 01:13:01.373
Hello.

01:13:06.424 --> 01:13:07.789
Hello?

01:13:11.929 --> 01:13:14.386
- All right?
- Hi.

01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:18.053
- Viv about?
- Through there.

01:13:23.524 --> 01:13:26.231
- Ah, Timothy.
- All right?

01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:30.061
- Just brought these round for her.
- Yeah, fine.

01:13:30.323 --> 01:13:33.065
Ah, Davy, you're up.
I didn't wanna knock.

01:13:33.284 --> 01:13:36.401
- How was the sofa?
- Uh, OK.

01:13:36.621 --> 01:13:41.081
This is Rhys, by the way.
Viv's... Miss Mae's brother.

01:13:41.292 --> 01:13:42.953
You're one of her
pupils then, are you?

01:13:43.419 --> 01:13:46.126
- What are you doing here?
- That's nice.

01:13:46.339 --> 01:13:48.330
On my way to work. I brought
that stuff you wanted, of dad's.

01:13:48.549 --> 01:13:50.710
- Oh, OK.
- Shouldn't you be at school?

01:13:50.927 --> 01:13:52.713
- Yeah.
- Bonjour.

01:13:52.887 --> 01:13:55.970
I had the most amazing
dream last night.

01:13:56.182 --> 01:13:59.800
I was making love to
a man with a beard.

01:14:00.645 --> 01:14:02.101
Hi.

01:14:02.313 --> 01:14:04.770
I'm Sylvie. I'm French.

01:14:04.982 --> 01:14:07.394
I am Rhys and I am Welsh.

01:14:19.205 --> 01:14:22.572
- Hey, Hoople, are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm OK. You?

01:14:22.792 --> 01:14:24.578
Yeah. See you later.

01:14:42.353 --> 01:14:44.435
- What's going on?
- Oh, it's the school hall, miss.

01:14:44.647 --> 01:14:46.888
It burnt down. We got a day off.

01:14:47.108 --> 01:14:48.348
Christ!

01:14:50.069 --> 01:14:51.229
Oh, no!

01:15:03.749 --> 01:15:05.614
All clear now, love.

01:15:22.101 --> 01:15:23.841
Oh, my God.

01:16:09.315 --> 01:16:13.024
If I could have your attention,
please. Thank you.

01:16:13.235 --> 01:16:16.602
Now, all classes are suspended

01:16:16.822 --> 01:16:19.529
until the building
has been made safe.

01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:23.192
Sporting events should
go ahead on the field,

01:16:23.412 --> 01:16:28.623
but, uh, obviously there
will be no school show.

01:16:28.834 --> 01:16:31.792
Otherwise, I think we should do
our best to get on with things

01:16:32.004 --> 01:16:34.461
and get things back to
normal as soon as possible.

01:16:34.715 --> 01:16:37.752
Now, I've just come off the
telephone to the police.

01:16:37.968 --> 01:16:40.334
I reckon it was the
wiring, Headmaster.

01:16:40.513 --> 01:16:42.378
Those lights were
dodgy as shit anyway.

01:16:42.598 --> 01:16:43.758
There was nothing wrong
with those lights.

01:16:44.016 --> 01:16:47.008
- Headmaster, I have made a list...
- Oh, don't tell me.

01:16:47.269 --> 01:16:50.602
Of all the nasty, little
troublemakers in the school.

01:16:50.815 --> 01:16:55.149
Do you hate kids? I mean, is it all
kids or is it just the poor ones?

01:16:55.402 --> 01:16:57.484
- Miss Mae, Vivienne...
- And I've underlined in red

01:16:57.696 --> 01:16:59.812
all those who have a
history of delinquency.

01:17:00.032 --> 01:17:03.195
- Miss Valentine, please.
- Christ, do you ever stop, woman?!

01:17:03.410 --> 01:17:06.573
What do you wanna do? You wanna
feel the bumps on their heads next?

01:17:06.789 --> 01:17:10.122
Someone has burnt half
the fucking school down!

01:17:10.334 --> 01:17:12.825
- Language, please.
- So let us stop this petty, liberal

01:17:13.045 --> 01:17:15.627
procrastination and take
control of the situation.

01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:19.879
We are fiddling while Rome burns!
Action must be taken!

01:17:20.094 --> 01:17:22.881
You see, that's it. "Petty,
liberal procrastination."

01:17:23.097 --> 01:17:25.258
That is what you think
self-expression is.

01:17:25.432 --> 01:17:28.094
And God forbid that you would ever
go the extra mile to find out

01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:30.050
what those kids are
actually good at!

01:17:30.271 --> 01:17:33.559
Well, it is no surprise that
the fire started where it did.

01:17:33.774 --> 01:17:35.894
What is that supposed to mean,
you condescending cow?!

01:17:36.152 --> 01:17:37.608
- Please, ladies, please!
- It is perfectly obvious!

01:17:37.778 --> 01:17:40.690
Please! Now, if you'd
just listen to me.

01:17:40.906 --> 01:17:43.522
I've just been on the
telephone to the police.

01:17:43.742 --> 01:17:46.484
They've informed me that
as of half an hour ago,

01:17:46.704 --> 01:17:49.616
they've taken in Kenneth
Loder for questioning.

01:18:00.968 --> 01:18:02.674
Miss Mae.

01:18:13.105 --> 01:18:15.767
I even fucked up being a teacher.

01:18:17.818 --> 01:18:21.060
Maybe being a teacher
isn't as easy as it looks.

01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:25.114
Anyway, who says you fucked it up?
Everybody says you're a great teacher.

01:18:25.326 --> 01:18:29.319
- Who says I'm a great teacher?
- Your two nutty friends.

01:18:33.834 --> 01:18:37.201
It meant such a lot
to me, this show.

01:18:37.421 --> 01:18:40.083
I thought it meant a lot
to them, too, you know.

01:18:41.217 --> 01:18:43.959
Half the time he couldn't even be
bothered to turn up to rehearsals.

01:18:44.178 --> 01:18:46.885
That is what kids do. They
skive off. It's their job.

01:18:47.097 --> 01:18:48.803
I never did that.

01:18:51.227 --> 01:18:53.138
You know your trouble, don't you?

01:18:53.896 --> 01:18:56.763
You have got high expectations.

01:18:56.941 --> 01:18:59.148
Whereas I have always
had low expectations,

01:18:59.401 --> 01:19:01.312
which is why I never
disappoint myself.

01:19:02.446 --> 01:19:04.311
You should try it sometime.

01:19:05.741 --> 01:19:10.280
- Lowering your expectations.
- I don't wanna end up like you.

01:19:16.335 --> 01:19:20.749
- Two chips, please, Mrs Wong.
- Bloody fantastic.

01:19:21.966 --> 01:19:26.209
"Hi, Hoople", she said,
"see you later."

01:19:26.428 --> 01:19:29.010
And now there won't be
any fucking rehearsals.

01:19:29.223 --> 01:19:32.090
Fuck! Just my bastard luck!
Fucking Kenny.

01:19:32.309 --> 01:19:35.472
See, I don't think it was him.
I think it was Angus.

01:19:35.646 --> 01:19:37.637
You know he's always setting stuff
alight. You know, blowing things up.

01:19:37.898 --> 01:19:39.263
- Ah, you can talk.
- True.

01:19:39.483 --> 01:19:41.815
Lots of salt and vinegar,
please, Mrs Wong.

01:19:42.027 --> 01:19:44.518
A lot more than you'd
think acceptable.

01:19:44.738 --> 01:19:48.151
See, he's always got that
fucking lighter on him as well.

01:19:48.409 --> 01:19:49.694
- You know what I mean?
- Well, he does smoke.

01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:52.276
Are you the fuckers that
dropped my brother in it?

01:19:57.376 --> 01:20:00.709
- Oh, fucking hell, Hoople!
- Let's fucking have them!

01:20:00.963 --> 01:20:02.373
Come back!

01:20:02.589 --> 01:20:05.581
- You're fucking dead!
- Let's fucking get them!

01:20:05.759 --> 01:20:07.624
You fucking pricks!

01:20:07.803 --> 01:20:09.168
Come here!

01:20:09.388 --> 01:20:10.673
Come on!

01:20:11.682 --> 01:20:13.513
Let's have them!

01:20:15.019 --> 01:20:17.431
- Fucking wankers!
- Let's fucking get them!

01:20:17.646 --> 01:20:18.646
Let's have 'em!

01:20:31.577 --> 01:20:35.195
- Oi, leave him alone!
- Fuck off!

01:20:35.414 --> 01:20:37.370
I said fucking leave him alone!

01:20:37.583 --> 01:20:39.119
- Is that right?
- Come on, then!

01:20:43.922 --> 01:20:47.130
Oi, leave him alone, you lot!
I'll call the police.

01:20:47.343 --> 01:20:50.301
- Fuck off, you wanker!
- Fucking wanker!

01:20:55.642 --> 01:20:58.759
- Hoople? You all right, or what?
- Fuck.

01:21:04.068 --> 01:21:06.650
It's not the first time,
to be honest with you.

01:21:08.072 --> 01:21:10.438
- It's boys, innit?
- Is this him?

01:21:10.699 --> 01:21:12.860
No, it's my eldest boy, Davy.

01:21:13.077 --> 01:21:17.446
- Everything all right?
- Angus is not at your mother's no more.

01:21:17.623 --> 01:21:21.457
Had an argument with her boyfriend
a couple of nights ago.

01:21:21.668 --> 01:21:23.533
Run off, hasn't come back.

01:21:25.339 --> 01:21:28.206
- Well, where is he now?
- Well, he's gone missing, ain't he.

01:21:28.467 --> 01:21:30.458
Again?

01:21:34.139 --> 01:21:37.723
Look. Fucking broke them.
Jesus Christ.

01:21:37.935 --> 01:21:41.803
- Look at 'em.
- Could have broken it.

01:21:49.947 --> 01:21:52.734
- You bastard!
- Lewis, don't.

01:21:52.950 --> 01:21:55.191
Why him? You're my best
mate, for fuck's sake.

01:21:55.452 --> 01:21:57.158
- That's way out of order.
- I knew he'd act like this.

01:21:57.371 --> 01:22:01.159
You dumped me. I thought it was 'cause
of your dad. You fucking used me.

01:22:01.333 --> 01:22:04.416
- Why are you so angry, Lewis?
- Because you're my sister. You can't.

01:22:04.586 --> 01:22:06.451
- Why not?
- He's in the band, you dozy cow,

01:22:06.630 --> 01:22:08.030
- that's why not.
- Shut up, Hoople.

01:22:08.173 --> 01:22:10.755
- So?
- You just don't get it, do you?

01:22:14.096 --> 01:22:16.257
Look, mate, there's some
things you just don't do.

01:22:16.473 --> 01:22:19.215
Piss off, Hoople. Just piss off!

01:22:19.476 --> 01:22:22.092
All right, then. I will.

01:22:42.499 --> 01:22:43.739
Swig?

01:22:45.252 --> 01:22:46.537
Thanks.

01:22:48.297 --> 01:22:50.458
Talked to your mother.

01:22:50.716 --> 01:22:53.583
She said Angus has been spotted
hanging round the arcades

01:22:53.844 --> 01:22:56.005
down by the fair in Porthcawl.

01:22:58.098 --> 01:23:00.384
Well, that's a relief, innit?

01:23:01.435 --> 01:23:04.802
- How come?
- Well...

01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:08.848
...means it couldn't have been him
that started that fire, doesn't it?

01:23:09.026 --> 01:23:12.484
I mean, if he was in
Porthcawl last night...

01:23:15.407 --> 01:23:17.944
He's probably gone
round Nan's by now.

01:23:19.286 --> 01:23:21.322
I'll go round in the morning.

01:23:24.041 --> 01:23:26.703
Shame about the show, huh?

01:23:30.672 --> 01:23:32.833
You worked hard for that, son.

01:23:37.554 --> 01:23:39.795
So, what are you
gonna do, Miss Mae?

01:23:43.185 --> 01:23:46.268
We used to put on these little
concerts in our back garden.

01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:51.065
Directed by me, of course.
Starring me, obviously.

01:23:51.276 --> 01:23:54.768
Accompanied by Rhys on his plastic
Woolworth Beatles guitar.

01:23:54.947 --> 01:23:56.687
God, I wish I'd had a
bossy sister like you.

01:24:00.661 --> 01:24:01.901
So, what are you gonna do?

01:24:05.707 --> 01:24:09.950
He always encouraged me, my dad.
That's the thing.

01:24:16.385 --> 01:24:18.671
"Don't let the bastards
grind you down."

01:24:18.845 --> 01:24:21.837
Oh, that was his favourite quote,
even when he was ill.

01:24:22.015 --> 01:24:24.006
- Karl Marx?
- Yeah, well, it's...

01:24:24.226 --> 01:24:27.184
...actually got a lot more impact
in the original German.

01:24:29.606 --> 01:24:33.770
Right, I think I spotted some sherry
in the kitchen. From Christmas.

01:24:33.986 --> 01:24:37.194
- Really?
- Technically it's an aperitif, I know.

01:24:51.336 --> 01:24:54.078
- Well, it hasn't rained all summer.
- Beg your pardon?

01:24:54.256 --> 01:24:56.338
- It hasn't rained all summer.
- Very good.

01:24:56.550 --> 01:24:59.963
- Yeah. If it rains, it rains.
- It is called "The Tempest."

01:25:00.178 --> 01:25:04.137
Oh, yeah, it is called "The Tempest,"
Headmaster, very funny, yeah.

01:25:04.349 --> 01:25:05.464
Yes, good idea.

01:25:05.684 --> 01:25:09.176
I think Shakespeare would approve. Out
there in nature, under the stars.

01:25:09.354 --> 01:25:10.764
Yes, yes, yes, yes, well, well...

01:25:10.939 --> 01:25:15.057
Yes. Yes, Headmaster.
Right, I'll see you later.

01:25:15.277 --> 01:25:16.608
Bye-bye.

01:25:17.070 --> 01:25:20.688
I've seen so many of
these over the years.

01:25:20.907 --> 01:25:24.070
The children never get
any older, do they?

01:25:25.203 --> 01:25:27.239
It's just the rest of us.

01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:35.328
You know the police have
released Kenneth Loder?

01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:40.082
- I didn't know that, no.
- Yeah, lack of evidence, apparently.

01:25:40.302 --> 01:25:43.590
So the culprit is still
out there somewhere.

01:25:47.059 --> 01:25:49.175
You thought about
my proposal, then?

01:25:49.394 --> 01:25:53.307
Now, I know you think I'm an
old fogy, but during the war,

01:25:53.523 --> 01:25:57.516
when I was in the Services, we
used to put shows on all the time.

01:25:57.736 --> 01:26:02.105
Raise morale, that sort of thing.
We had such fun.

01:26:02.366 --> 01:26:08.111
And those shows, well, I'd like to
think that they made a difference.

01:26:09.373 --> 01:26:12.365
- Shall I take that as a yes, then?
- Extreme times call for

01:26:12.584 --> 01:26:15.701
extreme measures, don't
you think, Miss Mae?

01:26:15.962 --> 01:26:20.581
Not that there's a war on now, of
course, but, uh, you get my drift?

01:26:21.718 --> 01:26:24.334
There's always a war
on, Headmaster.

01:26:31.645 --> 01:26:35.854
What about Miss Valentine?
Is she the future?

01:26:36.900 --> 01:26:41.610
"O brave new world that
has such people in't."

01:26:52.457 --> 01:26:55.824
Kenny, what are you doing here?
Are you all right?

01:26:59.256 --> 01:27:03.499
I bet you think it was me an' all,
don't you? Who started the fire.

01:27:03.719 --> 01:27:07.428
- No, I don't.
- Well, good. Because it wasn't.

01:27:13.854 --> 01:27:17.312
- I'm putting the show back on.
- No.

01:27:17.524 --> 01:27:20.607
No way. No way, miss.
Everybody fucking hates me.

01:27:20.819 --> 01:27:23.060
No, everybody hates me.

01:27:24.531 --> 01:27:27.113
You don't have to play Caliban.

01:27:27.325 --> 01:27:31.944
Just do a couple of lines.
I got another part for you.

01:27:33.373 --> 01:27:35.113
Come on, let's show 'em.

01:27:38.420 --> 01:27:41.002
A devil, a born devil.

01:27:41.214 --> 01:27:43.214
On whose nature Nurture
can never stick.

01:27:44.718 --> 01:27:49.212
On whom my pains
humanely taken, all...

01:27:49.431 --> 01:27:53.390
All lost, quite lost.

01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:56.643
And as with age, his
body uglier grows,

01:27:56.897 --> 01:27:59.388
so his mind canker.

01:27:59.608 --> 01:28:03.817
I will plague them all,
even to roaring.

01:28:04.988 --> 01:28:08.355
Even to roaring!

01:28:09.493 --> 01:28:11.609
Roaring!

01:28:18.210 --> 01:28:23.045
Most sure, 'tis the goddess
on whom the music attends.

01:28:23.256 --> 01:28:28.091
Most sure, 'tis the goddess
on whom the music attends.

01:28:28.303 --> 01:28:31.921
O you wonder! Tell me
if you be maid or no.

01:28:32.974 --> 01:28:37.013
O you wonder! Tell me
if you be maid or no.

01:28:37.187 --> 01:28:40.179
Davy? I'm off to work now.

01:28:40.357 --> 01:28:42.188
Good luck for tonight.

01:28:43.068 --> 01:28:46.185
No wonder, sir, but
certainly a maid.

01:28:47.113 --> 01:28:49.149
Yeah, that sounds nice.

01:28:51.660 --> 01:28:54.527
More work. Let me remind you
of what you promised me

01:28:54.746 --> 01:28:58.534
which has not yet been
performed. My liberty.

01:28:58.750 --> 01:29:01.116
- Go on.
- Be not a feared,

01:29:01.336 --> 01:29:04.078
the isle is full of noises,
sounds and sweet airs

01:29:04.256 --> 01:29:07.089
that give delight and hurt not.

01:29:17.644 --> 01:29:19.509
Need a hand?

01:29:22.607 --> 01:29:23.687
I said I'm sorry, Lew.

01:29:26.987 --> 01:29:28.693
Fuck's sake, Lewis.

01:29:34.911 --> 01:29:37.072
One last gig?

01:31:06.086 --> 01:31:09.624
It's a god-awful small affair

01:31:09.839 --> 01:31:14.333
To the girl with the mousy hair

01:31:14.511 --> 01:31:18.424
But her mummy is yelling, "No"

01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:22.758
And her daddy has told her to go

01:31:22.936 --> 01:31:27.100
But her friend is
nowhere to be seen

01:31:27.357 --> 01:31:30.895
Now she walks through
her sunken dream

01:31:31.695 --> 01:31:35.654
To the seat with the clearest view

01:31:35.865 --> 01:31:38.481
And she's hooked to
the silver screen

01:31:40.286 --> 01:31:44.279
But the film is a saddening bore

01:31:44.499 --> 01:31:48.583
For she's lived it
ten times or more

01:31:48.795 --> 01:31:52.663
She could spit in the eyes of fools

01:31:52.882 --> 01:31:55.089
As they ask her to focus on

01:31:55.301 --> 01:32:00.011
Sailors fighting in the dance hall

01:32:00.223 --> 01:32:04.592
Oh, man, look at those cavemen go

01:32:06.146 --> 01:32:10.139
It's the freakiest show

01:32:10.358 --> 01:32:13.566
Take a look at the lawman

01:32:13.778 --> 01:32:16.019
Beating up the wrong guy

01:32:16.281 --> 01:32:19.773
Oh, man, wonder if he'll ever know

01:32:22.037 --> 01:32:26.280
He's in the bestselling show

01:32:26.499 --> 01:32:30.037
Is there life on Mars?

01:33:55.088 --> 01:33:57.249
Hi, hi, my hearts.

01:33:57.465 --> 01:34:00.172
Cheerily, cheerly my hearts.

01:34:00.426 --> 01:34:02.291
Take down the topsail.

01:34:02.554 --> 01:34:05.887
Tend to the master's whistle.

01:34:07.308 --> 01:34:10.141
Blow to thou, blow my wind.

01:34:10.353 --> 01:34:12.435
Down with the top mast.

01:34:12.605 --> 01:34:15.597
A plague upon this howling!

01:34:25.410 --> 01:34:28.948
I've been thinking now

01:34:29.789 --> 01:34:34.123
For a long time

01:34:34.335 --> 01:34:36.542
How to go

01:34:36.754 --> 01:34:41.544
My own separate way

01:34:43.261 --> 01:34:47.345
It's a shame to think

01:34:47.557 --> 01:34:52.051
About yesterday

01:34:52.270 --> 01:34:56.809
It's a shame

01:34:57.025 --> 01:35:01.314
A shame

01:35:01.529 --> 01:35:05.192
A shame

01:35:06.075 --> 01:35:10.614
A shame

01:36:46.676 --> 01:36:49.463
Our revels now are ended.

01:36:49.679 --> 01:36:53.217
And these, our actors,
as I foretold you,

01:36:53.474 --> 01:36:57.513
were all spirits and
are melted into air,

01:36:57.729 --> 01:37:00.141
into thin air.

01:37:00.315 --> 01:37:04.399
And like this insubstantial
pageant, faded,

01:37:04.569 --> 01:37:07.311
leave not a rack behind.

01:37:09.615 --> 01:37:14.029
We are such stuff as
dreams are made of,

01:37:14.287 --> 01:37:18.826
and our little life is
rounded with a sleep.

01:38:27.777 --> 01:38:30.894
Sailin' away on the crest of a wave

01:38:31.114 --> 01:38:34.572
It's like magic

01:38:34.784 --> 01:38:39.118
Oh, rollin' and ridin'
and slippin' and slidin'

01:38:39.288 --> 01:38:42.780
It's magic

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:44.991
And you

01:38:45.211 --> 01:38:50.126
And your sweet desire

01:38:50.341 --> 01:38:54.050
You took me

01:38:54.303 --> 01:38:58.672
- Oh
- Higher and higher, baby

01:38:59.976 --> 01:39:02.558
It's a livin' thing

01:39:03.646 --> 01:39:07.264
It's a terrible thing to lose

01:39:07.442 --> 01:39:10.024
It's a given thing

01:39:11.487 --> 01:39:15.696
What a terrible thing to lose

01:39:18.202 --> 01:39:20.238
And I'm takin' a dive

01:39:21.998 --> 01:39:24.535
Halt the slide

01:39:29.755 --> 01:39:32.918
Takin' a dive 'cause you
can't halt the slide

01:39:33.134 --> 01:39:36.672
- Floating downstream
- I'm takin' a dive

01:39:36.929 --> 01:39:40.638
Oh, so let her go
Don't start spoiling the show

01:39:40.808 --> 01:39:44.847
- It's a bad dream
- I'm takin', I'm takin'

01:39:45.021 --> 01:39:47.307
And you

01:39:47.523 --> 01:39:51.482
And your sweet desire

01:39:51.694 --> 01:39:57.189
- Don't you do it
- You took me

01:39:57.366 --> 01:40:00.233
Higher and higher, baby

01:40:01.871 --> 01:40:03.577
It's a livin' thing

01:40:05.708 --> 01:40:09.576
It's a terrible thing to lose

01:40:09.795 --> 01:40:11.751
It's a given thing

01:40:13.466 --> 01:40:17.129
What a terrible thing to lose

01:40:17.303 --> 01:40:19.589
It's a given thing

01:40:21.224 --> 01:40:25.058
What a terrible thing to lose

01:40:25.269 --> 01:40:27.225
It's a livin' thing

01:40:28.940 --> 01:40:32.683
It's a terrible thing to lose

01:40:32.860 --> 01:40:34.976
It's a given thing

01:40:36.614 --> 01:40:40.402
What a terrible thing to lose

01:40:40.618 --> 01:40:42.734
It's a livin' thing

01:40:44.455 --> 01:40:48.289
What a terrible thing to lose

01:40:48.459 --> 01:40:50.620
It's a given thing

01:40:52.171 --> 01:40:56.039
What a terrible thing to lose

01:40:56.259 --> 01:40:58.250
It's a livin' thing

01:40:59.845 --> 01:41:04.930
What a terrible thing to lose
