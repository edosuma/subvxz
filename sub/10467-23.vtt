11:12.410 --> 11:14.630
OK, GOOD.
THEN I'LL JUST, UM...

11:14.630 --> 11:16.632
YEAH, I'LL JUST--
I'LL CATCH HIM THERE.

11:16.632 --> 11:18.373
YOU KNOW WHAT,
DAPHNE? WAIT.

11:18.373 --> 11:20.854
IT'S REALLY NICE
TO SEE YOU TWO.

11:20.854 --> 11:21.855
BYE.

11:21.855 --> 11:23.334
BYE.

11:23.334 --> 11:25.249
YOU DIDN'T...

11:25.249 --> 11:28.252
TELL HER THAT
CHARLIE'S BACK TOGETHER
WITH KIRSTEN?

11:28.252 --> 11:30.385
I WASN'T GONNA JUST
DROP IT ON HER LIKE THAT.

11:30.385 --> 11:31.995
THAT'S FOR CHARLIE TO DO.

11:31.995 --> 11:34.694
HE'S GOTTA TELL HER
THE WAY HE WANTS.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.521
WHAT DID SHE SAY?
DID SHE SAY WHY
SHE WAS HERE?

11:36.521 --> 11:39.611
YES. CAN I PLEASE SPEAK
WITH MR. SALINGER?

11:39.611 --> 11:42.571
AND EVEN IF HE'S WITH HIS CLASS,
COULD YOU PLEASE INTERRUPT HIM?

11:42.571 --> 11:44.878
A FIELD TRIP?

11:44.878 --> 11:46.923
SWELL.

11:46.923 --> 11:49.796
HEY, JULE, WAIT UP.
YOU OK?

11:49.796 --> 11:53.408
NO. IT'S BAD ENOUGH
O'NEIL WANTS ME TO REWRITE
THE STORY AGAIN,

11:53.408 --> 11:55.279
BUT THE NOTES
SHE GAVE ME ARE CRAZY,
LIKE SHE DIDN'T EVEN READ IT.

11:55.279 --> 11:57.064
I DID. I THOUGHT
IT WAS GREAT.

11:57.064 --> 11:58.456
PLUS,
I'VE GOT THIS MILLENNIUM
APPLICATION ESSAY TO WRITE.

11:58.456 --> 12:00.589
WHEN AM I SUPPOSED TO SLEEP?

12:00.589 --> 12:03.331
MAYBE I'LL JUST GIVE O'NEIL
THE SAME VERSION,
LET HER FLUNK ME.

12:03.331 --> 12:05.202
YEAH, RIGHT.
FLUNK THE BEST WRITER
IN CLASS?

12:05.202 --> 12:06.508
ASIDE FROM ME,
OF COURSE.

12:06.508 --> 12:08.249
WHOA. JOSH,
YOU HAVE JUST SAID

12:08.249 --> 12:10.294
10 SUPPORTIVE THINGS
TO ME IN A ROW.

12:10.294 --> 12:12.166
WHY ARE YOU STILL
SO NICE TO ME?

12:12.166 --> 12:13.907
YOU REALLY WANNA KNOW?
UH-HUH.

12:13.907 --> 12:14.995
IT'S RESEARCH
FOR A STORY
I'M WRITING.

12:14.995 --> 12:16.518
YEAH. IT'S ABOUT
THIS GUY--

12:16.518 --> 12:18.259
SORT OF UNPREPOSSESSING,

12:18.259 --> 12:21.131
NEUROTIC,
BUT IN A GOOD WAY,
GUY WHO'S GOT A PROBLEM.

12:21.131 --> 12:22.219
OTHER THAN BEING NEUROTIC?

12:22.219 --> 12:23.394
YEAH. SEE,
THERE'S THIS WOMAN--

12:23.394 --> 12:25.875
THIS MYSTERIOUS,
HAUNTED, BEAUTIFUL--

12:25.875 --> 12:27.311
OK.

12:27.311 --> 12:29.313
AND HE JUST CAN'T STOP
ASKING HER OUT,

12:29.313 --> 12:31.576
NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES
SHE SAYS NO.

12:31.576 --> 12:35.145
SO MY BEING NICE TO YOU
IS PURE RESEARCH.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.628
MAYBE IT'S NOT HIM
WHO'S BEING NEUROTIC.

12:39.628 --> 12:40.281
MAYBE IT'S HER.

12:41.630 --> 12:42.718
YOU THINK?

12:42.718 --> 12:44.372
WELL, IT SEEMS

12:44.372 --> 12:46.504
SHE KEEPS GOING
FOR THE WRONG PEOPLE.

12:46.504 --> 12:48.463
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

12:48.463 --> 12:50.334
MAYBE 'CAUSE SHE DOESN'T
THINK SHE DESERVES
SOMEONE THAT NICE.

12:50.334 --> 12:53.424
SO WHAT--WHAT HAPPENS
IN THE END?

12:53.424 --> 12:55.600
DOES HE ASK HER OUT AGAIN?

12:55.600 --> 12:58.038
WELL, IT'S YOUR STORY,

12:58.038 --> 13:01.389
BUT IF I WERE HIM,
I'D PICK HER UP AT 7:00.

13:18.188 --> 13:20.974
JUST STEPPED OFF
A BUS MYSELF.

GOTTEN ANY SLEEP.

ARE YOU DOING HERE?

13:58.663 --> 14:00.491
THAT YOU'RE NOT LIVING
AT THE HOUSE ANYMORE.

14:00.491 --> 14:02.319

ANYTHING ELSE.

UH, SOMETHING GOING ON?

14:04.321 --> 14:05.714

IS SHE--

14:05.714 --> 14:06.933
DAPHNE, LOOK--

14:06.933 --> 14:09.109

14:09.109 --> 14:12.112

I WAS IN TEXAS.

14:12.112 --> 14:14.375
GOD, I'M SORRY.

14:14.375 --> 14:18.292
WELL, A LOT OF THINGS
GOT CLEARER.

14:18.292 --> 14:21.338
WHAT I REALLY WANT
GOT CLEARER.

14:21.338 --> 14:24.037
AND HOW DUMB I WAS
FOR GIVING EVERYTHING UP.

14:24.037 --> 14:25.995
THAT GOT A LOT CLEARER.

14:25.995 --> 14:29.564

ABOUT THE 3 OF US

20:04.377 --> 20:06.944
YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT MY HAIR, EITHER.

20:06.944 --> 20:09.033
IT'S RED.

20:09.033 --> 20:11.384
I'M SORRY. YOU KNOW,
IT'S DARK OUT,
I'M KINDA COLORBLIND.

20:11.384 --> 20:13.037
YOU HATE IT, THE HAIR
AND THE TATTOOS.

20:15.736 --> 20:17.955
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

20:17.955 --> 20:21.394
CODY, YOU REALLY
LIKE 'EM?

20:21.394 --> 20:24.353
NOT THE HAIR
OR THE TATTOOS. YOU.

20:24.353 --> 20:26.312
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SAY THAT, CODY.

20:26.312 --> 20:27.574
I CAN'T HELP IT.

20:29.097 --> 20:30.794
AHEM.

20:30.794 --> 20:33.971
CODY, YOU DIDN'T INTRODUCE ME
TO YOUR LITTLE FRIEND.

20:33.971 --> 20:35.930
OH, HI.
HI, I'M CLAUDIA.

20:35.930 --> 20:37.453
WOW, YOU'RE
ALL HENNA-HANDED.

20:37.453 --> 20:40.151
BIG FAN OF MADONNA'S,
ARE YA?

20:40.151 --> 20:43.154
OUR MIDNIGHT SET'S UP, CODY.
YOU SHOULD COME WATCH.

20:43.154 --> 20:46.897
PLEASE. OH, PLEASE TELL ME
THE MIDNIGHT SET'S
STARTING EARLY.

20:48.290 --> 20:50.161
RIGHT ON TIME.

20:50.161 --> 20:52.729
OK, BAILEY'S GONNA
ACTUALLY KILL ME THIS TIME.

20:52.729 --> 20:55.776
MAYBE IF WE HURRY HOME,
I WON'T BE THAT LATE.

20:55.776 --> 20:57.691
OHH!

20:57.691 --> 20:59.693
I'M...SORRY.

20:59.693 --> 21:01.695
YOU OWE ME A BEER.

21:05.307 --> 21:06.961
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

21:10.399 --> 21:11.661
[KNOCK KNOCK]

21:14.360 --> 21:16.231
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU
MEANT BY THAT STATEMENT.

21:16.231 --> 21:18.494
OH, I'M SORRY--

21:18.494 --> 21:20.801
"YOU DON'T LET ANY
MOSS GROW, DO YOU?"
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID.

21:20.801 --> 21:22.890
WAIT A SECOND--
I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT YOU MEANT.

21:22.890 --> 21:25.893
LOOK, I'M NOT GONNA
HAVE THIS CONVERSATION
OUT IN THE HALLWAY, SO...

21:29.375 --> 21:31.377
WHAT HAPPENED
WITH YOU AND JOSH?

21:31.377 --> 21:33.596
NOTHING HAPPENED.
WE HAD A FINE TIME.

21:33.596 --> 21:37.513
ONLY THE LAST HOUR
AND A HALF OF THE DATE,
I WASN'T EVEN THERE.

21:37.513 --> 21:40.211
I WAS TOTALLY IN MY HEAD
WONDERING WHY YOU WOULD
WANT TO HURT ME.

21:40.211 --> 21:42.997
YOU THINK THAT'S
WHAT I WANTED TO DO?
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

21:42.997 --> 21:44.955
POOR JULIA?
POOR PATHETIC JULIA,

21:44.955 --> 21:46.609
SHE'S SO DESPERATE
AND NEEDY,

21:46.609 --> 21:48.219
SHE'LL GO OUT WITH
A GUY SHE DOESN'T LIKE

21:48.219 --> 21:49.960
JUST SO SHE WON'T HAVE TO
SPEND THE NIGHT ON HER OWN?

21:49.960 --> 21:51.397
NO, THAT IS NOT
WHAT I WAS THINKING.

21:51.397 --> 21:53.050
WELL, THEN WHAT?

21:53.050 --> 21:55.662
WHAT? THAT I WAS
SO FREAKED OUT
THAT WE KISSED,

21:55.662 --> 21:58.882
THAT I'D THROW MYSELF AT
THE FIRST AVAILABLE GUY TO
PROVE THAT I'M STILL STRAIGHT?

21:58.882 --> 22:03.017
NO! JULIA, LOOK, WHAT
DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

22:03.017 --> 22:05.759
OK, BECAUSE
WHATEVER I DO, I JUST--

22:05.759 --> 22:08.283
I JUST CAN'T SEEM
TO GET IT RIGHT FOR YOU.

22:11.068 --> 22:12.809
YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT I WAS THINKING

22:12.809 --> 22:16.291
WHEN I WAS LOOKING
AT YOU AND JOSH?

22:16.291 --> 22:19.033
I WAS THINKING,
"ISN'T THAT NICE,"
YOU KNOW?

22:19.033 --> 22:21.557
WOULDN'T IT BE AMAZING,
IF AFTER ALL THIS TIME,

22:21.557 --> 22:25.169
JOSH AND JULIA MIGHT
ACTUALLY BE MEANT
FOR EACH OTHER?

22:28.956 --> 22:32.351
I DON'T THINK WE ARE.

22:32.351 --> 22:34.614
YEAH, I THOUGHT
THAT, TOO.

22:36.355 --> 22:39.096
AND I ALSO THOUGHT,

22:39.096 --> 22:41.316
IF YOU MUST KNOW...

22:43.405 --> 22:47.409
THAT JULIA'S IN A HURRY,
THAT'S ALL.

22:47.409 --> 22:52.153
IN A HURRY, YES,
FOR SOMEONE.

22:52.153 --> 22:54.808
LOOK, I'M NOT, UH,

22:54.808 --> 22:57.201
I'M NOT GOOD AT THIS--
THIS PEOPLE STUFF.

22:57.201 --> 23:00.074
I'M A WRITER, AND
THAT'S WHAT I'M GOOD AT,

23:00.074 --> 23:03.947
AND I'M GOOD AT SEEING
THE WRITER IN YOU,

23:03.947 --> 23:05.993
AND I DO SEE ONE.

23:05.993 --> 23:07.386
WHAT DOES THIS
HAVE TO DO--

23:07.386 --> 23:09.997
HOWEVER CLUELESS THEY
ARE ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE,

23:09.997 --> 23:12.129
WE KNOW WHAT'S
INSIDE OF US.

23:12.129 --> 23:16.395
AND WE KNOW WE CAN TURN
INSIDE OF OURSELVES
TO GET WHAT WE NEED.

23:16.395 --> 23:18.397
WE HAVE TO.

23:18.397 --> 23:19.876
YOU HAVE TO.

23:19.876 --> 23:23.358
NOT TO ME,
NOT TO ANYONE ELSE,

23:23.358 --> 23:25.360
BUT TO YOURSELF.

23:25.360 --> 23:28.755
FOR A CHANGE, HUH?

23:28.755 --> 23:31.018
LOOK...

23:31.018 --> 23:33.368
IT'S NOT LIKE
YOU DON'T NEED ANYBODY,

23:33.368 --> 23:35.152
LIKE A FRIEND OR A LOVER,

23:35.152 --> 23:36.806
WE ALL DO.

23:36.806 --> 23:39.113
BUT JUST DON'T BE
AFRAID OF BEING ALONE.

23:39.113 --> 23:40.767
I'M NOT. I'M--

23:40.767 --> 23:43.509
BECAUSE YOU
WOULDN'T BE ALONE.

23:43.509 --> 23:46.512
YOU'D BE WITH
MY FRIEND JULIA.

23:46.512 --> 23:47.730
YOU CAN TRUST HER.

23:49.819 --> 23:51.821
SHE'S THE REAL THING.

24:01.918 --> 24:03.659
WELL, GOOD NIGHT,
I GUESS.

24:03.659 --> 24:05.922
SORRY ABOUT ALL THIS.

24:05.922 --> 24:08.316
HEY, I'M THE ONE
WHO TOOK YOU OUT

24:08.316 --> 24:10.274
FOR A DATE IN
A PARKING LOT.
SO...

24:10.274 --> 24:12.581
NO, IT WAS GREAT.

24:12.581 --> 24:14.365
I MEAN, I GOT TO
MEET YOUR FRIENDS

24:14.365 --> 24:16.585
AND HANG OUT WITH YOU.

24:18.326 --> 24:21.416
AND YOU GAVE ME
THE MOST AMAZING PRESENT.

24:21.416 --> 24:23.287
I DID?

24:23.287 --> 24:25.681
WELL, YOU'RE ABOUT TO.

24:35.909 --> 24:38.172
OH, NO!

24:38.172 --> 24:40.435
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT TIME IT IS?

24:40.435 --> 24:43.307
YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT
YOU SOUND LIKE WHEN YOU
SPEAK TO ME THAT WAY?

24:43.307 --> 24:45.962
WHAT'S THE POINT OF EVEN
GIVEN YOU A CURFEW IF YOU'RE
NOT GONNA RESPECT IT, HUH?

24:45.962 --> 24:46.833
I COULDN'T HAVE SAID IT
BETTER MYSELF.

24:46.833 --> 24:48.965
ARE YOU DRUNK?

24:48.965 --> 24:49.966
ARE YOU HIGH?

24:49.966 --> 24:51.315
YOU ARE.
I CAN SMELL IT.

24:51.315 --> 24:52.360
DID YOU GET
HER DRUNK, HUH?

24:52.360 --> 24:53.579
HEY, MAN, LOOK--

24:53.579 --> 24:55.058
AND YOU WERE DRIVING.
HOW MANY DID YOU HAVE, HUH?

24:55.058 --> 24:56.190
LEAVE HIM ALONE,
BAILEY.

24:56.190 --> 24:57.583
CLAUDIA, GO INSIDE.

24:57.583 --> 24:58.714
GO INSIDE!

24:58.714 --> 25:00.281
I DON'T DRINK,
ALL RIGHT?

25:00.281 --> 25:02.413
I CAN'T,
SO JUST BACK OFF.

25:02.413 --> 25:05.721
JUST GO HOME, CODY,
PLEASE.

25:05.721 --> 25:07.114
I'LL SEE YOU
TOMORROW, OK?

25:10.465 --> 25:12.772
YOU WILL NOT SEE HIM
TOMORROW, CLAUDIA.

25:12.772 --> 25:15.557
CLAUDIA, PLEASE LISTEN TO ME.

25:15.557 --> 25:18.473
I JUST DON'T THINK
YOU NEED TO BE MAKING
A HABIT OUT DRINKING, OK?

25:18.473 --> 25:20.649
NO, IT'S NOT OK, BAILEY.

25:20.649 --> 25:22.608
JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH ALCOHOL
DOESN'T MEAN I DO.

25:22.608 --> 25:24.087
YES, IT DOES,
CLAUDIA.

25:24.087 --> 25:26.176
IT RUNS
IN OUR FAMILY.

25:26.176 --> 25:28.527
CHARLIE'S NOT AN ALCOHOLIC,
JULIA'S NOT AN ALCOHOLIC,
ONLY YOU.

25:32.879 --> 25:35.882
WHAT IS HAPPENING
TO YOU, CLAUDIA?

25:35.882 --> 25:38.275
I DON'T EVEN RECOGNIZE
YOU ANYMORE.

25:38.275 --> 25:40.626
AND OUT OF ALL OF US,

25:40.626 --> 25:43.498
YOU AND ME...

25:43.498 --> 25:46.501
YOU USED TO TELL ME
EVERYTHING.

25:46.501 --> 25:50.505
I WAS A GOOD LITTLE GIRL,
WASN'T I?

25:50.505 --> 25:53.203
SO WHAT, SO YOU
GET YOUR HAIR DYED

25:53.203 --> 25:54.857
AND YOU GET TATTOOED

25:54.857 --> 25:57.860
AND--AND ALL OF A SUDDEN
YOU THINK THAT MAKES
YOU A GROWNUP?

25:57.860 --> 26:01.037
BECAUSE I GOT
TO TELL YOU, CLAUD,
IT'S JUST THE OPPOSITE.

26:01.037 --> 26:04.345
YOU CAN TELL ME WHATEVER
YOU WANT, BAILEY,

26:04.345 --> 26:06.216
BUT IT'S MY LIFE.

26:06.216 --> 26:09.002
EVEN AT 16, THERE'S NOTHING
YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT.

26:09.002 --> 26:10.612
NO, SEE, THAT'S
WHERE YOU'RE WRONG.

26:10.612 --> 26:11.570
DON'T THREATEN ME, BAILEY.

26:11.570 --> 26:14.007
YOU'RE NOT MY DAD.

26:14.007 --> 26:16.139
YOU'RE NOT EVEN CHARLIE,
SO STOP TRYING TO BE.

26:18.402 --> 26:20.448
I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

26:22.276 --> 26:24.321
I'VE BEEN DOING THAT
FOR A WHILE NOW.

26:35.071 --> 26:37.987
OH, EXCUSE ME. HI. CAN
I GET A SODA, PLEASE?

26:37.987 --> 26:40.076
SOMETHING VERY,
VERY CAFFEINATED.

26:40.076 --> 26:41.861
UH-OH! CURVY ROADS
GOT YOU DOZING?

26:41.861 --> 26:43.253
UH, I'M JUST
A PASSENGER.

26:43.253 --> 26:45.212
THEN I SAY KICK-BACK
AND TAKE A SNOOZE.

26:45.212 --> 26:48.563
YEAH, YOU WOULDN'T
SAY THAT IF YOU HAD A
500-WORD ESSAY TO WRITE.

26:48.563 --> 26:51.044
LOOK, THE BUS DRIVER
SAID THAT I HAD TO
TRANSFER TO ANOTHER BUS

26:51.044 --> 26:53.612
IN ORDER TO GET WITHIN
WALKING DISTANCE OF
THE CAMPER'S STATION.

26:53.612 --> 26:55.614
YEAH, THE GRAFTON BUS
WILL GET YOU THERE.

26:55.614 --> 26:57.180
IT'S GASSING UP
IN THE ALLEY.

26:57.180 --> 26:59.400
THAT'LL BE A DOLLAR EVEN.

26:59.400 --> 27:01.968
OH, THERE YOU GO.
DO I HAVE TIME FOR
A PHONE CALL?

27:01.968 --> 27:03.230
MM-HMM.

27:03.230 --> 27:04.840
THANKS.

27:11.107 --> 27:14.545
WHEN DID HE SAY HE
WANTED TO SEE OWEN AGAIN?

27:14.545 --> 27:18.549
OK, WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
WAIT TILL I GET HOME TO
MAKE THE APPOINTMENT?

27:18.549 --> 27:23.250
NO, BAILEY, IT'S JUST THAT
I KNOW EVERYBODY'S SCHEDULES
BETTER THAN YOU DO.

27:23.250 --> 27:26.035
I AM, TOO,
FOCUSED ON MY WORK.

27:26.035 --> 27:29.691
IN FACT, I'M HALFWAY
THROUGH MY ESSAY.

27:29.691 --> 27:32.868
IN FACT, I AM MORE
THAN HALFWAY THROUGH.

27:32.868 --> 27:36.219
HEY, DID YOU CALL
THE EXTERMINATOR?

27:36.219 --> 27:38.482
BAILEY...

27:38.482 --> 27:41.050
OH! YIKES,
MY BUS IS LEAVING.

27:41.050 --> 27:44.314
YES, ME, TOO.
I LOVE YOU, TOO. BYE.

27:53.149 --> 27:54.324
HEY.

27:54.324 --> 27:56.370
OH, IT'S YOU.

27:56.370 --> 27:59.373
HOLD ON. I MADE A NOTE
TO MYSELF ABOUT YOU.

27:59.373 --> 28:01.897
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
I GET THIS RIGHT.

28:01.897 --> 28:04.378
UH, OK, HERE IT IS.

28:04.378 --> 28:07.033
"NOTE TO SELF: UH, DON'T
BE A JERK ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

28:07.033 --> 28:09.035
"OK, MAYBE SHE
CUT IT A LITTLE SHORT,

28:09.035 --> 28:12.168
"BUT THE MAIN THING IS
YOU HAD A GOOD TIME

28:12.168 --> 28:14.518
AND, UH,
SHE HAD A GOOD TIME?"

28:14.518 --> 28:17.826
YES, SHE DID, VERY.

28:17.826 --> 28:19.393
SO THE PLAN WAS,
WHEN I SAW YOU AGAIN,

28:19.393 --> 28:21.656
I WOULDN'T COMPLAIN
ABOUT THE EARLY HOUR.

28:21.656 --> 28:25.442
I'D JUST SAY THANKS,
AND HOW ABOUT WE DO IT
AGAIN TONIGHT?

28:30.752 --> 28:32.667
I'D LIKE TO, JOSH.

28:32.667 --> 28:37.063
I'M SENSING A "BUT"
IN THERE, A "BUT"
OR A "HOWEVER."

28:37.063 --> 28:40.806
COULD WE JUST--
COULD WE KEEP IT VAGUE?

28:40.806 --> 28:42.764
VAGUE, LIKE,
UH, TOMORROW,

28:42.764 --> 28:45.071
OR VAGUE
LIKE THE NEXT DAY?

28:45.071 --> 28:48.770
NO, VAGUE, MORE LIKE, UM...

28:48.770 --> 28:50.554
SEPTEMBERISH?

28:52.339 --> 28:55.777
UH-HUH, I GET IT.

28:55.777 --> 28:58.562
NO, JOSH, YOU DON'T
'CAUSE YOU'RE ANGRY.
AND IF YOU UNDERSTOOD--

28:58.562 --> 28:59.912
YOU DID THIS TO ME
ONCE BEFORE, JULIA.

28:59.912 --> 29:01.740
NO, IT'S DIFFERENT.

29:01.740 --> 29:03.437
REALLY? IT SURE DOESN'T
FEEL DIFFERENT.

29:03.437 --> 29:05.874
OK, WELL, MAYBE
THE END RESULT
IS THE SAME,

29:05.874 --> 29:08.007
BUT THIS TIME,
IT IS NOT ME
CHOOSING ANOTHER GUY,

29:08.007 --> 29:10.052
IT'S ME CHOOSING ME.

29:10.052 --> 29:13.926
WAIT, YOU'RE NOT GONNA,
LIKE, BREAK INTO SONG
OR SOMETHING, ARE YOU?

29:13.926 --> 29:16.580
YOU KNOW HOW THEY SAY YOU
HAVE TO EMBRACE THE THINGS
THAT YOU FEAR MOST?

29:16.580 --> 29:18.626
WHAT, LIKE SPIDERS?

29:18.626 --> 29:21.107
WELL, FOR ME,
IT'S BEING ALONE.
THAT'S WHAT I FEAR MOST.

29:21.107 --> 29:23.762
I'VE NEVER REALLY
COMPLETELY BEEN BY MYSELF.

29:23.762 --> 29:28.331
MAYBE IT'S GOT SOMETHING
TO DO WITH MY PARENTS DYING
AND FEELING SO ALONE

29:28.331 --> 29:32.640
AND THE ONLY ANSWER
WAS JUST TO NEVER BE ALONE.

29:32.640 --> 29:35.164
MAKES SENSE, I GUESS.

29:35.164 --> 29:39.386
YEAH. AND THAT PATTERN
STARTED AND IT NEVER STOPPED.

29:39.386 --> 29:41.431
LOOK, EACH GUY
I'VE BEEN WITH

29:41.431 --> 29:44.130
HAS SORTA BEEN THE ANSWER
TO THE ONE WHO CAME BEFORE.

29:44.130 --> 29:47.437
IT WASN'T ME CHOOSING
SO MUCH AS RICOCHETING.

29:47.437 --> 29:50.745
AND IT COULD GO
ON AND ON LIKE THAT
IF I DON'T STOP AND SAY,

29:50.745 --> 29:52.703
"HEY, WHERE AM I IN THIS?

29:52.703 --> 29:56.185
"JULIE. ME. WHO--
WHO AM I WITHOUT ALL
THESE PEOPLE AROUND ME?

29:56.185 --> 29:57.796
WHO AM I ON MY OWN?"

30:00.320 --> 30:03.453
AND I'M SORRY, I REALLY AM
'CAUSE I LIKE YOU A LOT.

30:03.453 --> 30:06.065
YEAH, WELL...

30:06.065 --> 30:08.676
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
I'M NOT GONNA...

30:10.809 --> 30:13.333
I DON'T THINK
I'LL BE ABLE TO,

30:13.333 --> 30:14.987
LIKE, WAIT
AROUND FOR YOU

30:14.987 --> 30:16.205
TO FIGURE
ALL THIS STUFF OUT.

30:16.205 --> 30:18.686
NO, I KNOW.

30:18.686 --> 30:21.341
I KNOW THAT'S A RISK.

30:21.341 --> 30:24.344
AND WHAT IF I GIVE UP
SOMEONE REALLY GREAT

30:24.344 --> 30:25.824
AND LET THEM SLIP AWAY?

30:28.043 --> 30:29.479
AND THE OLD ME WOULD
AND THE NEW ME--

30:29.479 --> 30:34.136
OR THE TRYING-TO-BE
NEW ME KINDA THINKS
I HAVE TO.

VERY MUCH.

42:21.190 --> 42:23.018
IF YOU WANT TO GIVE HER
A BOTTLE...

42:23.018 --> 42:24.629
YOU GOING OUT?

42:24.629 --> 42:27.327
UH, TO A MOVIE, YEAH.

42:27.327 --> 42:29.024
HAVE A GOOD TIME.

42:40.209 --> 42:41.863
KIRSTEN,
WAIT A MINUTE.

42:41.863 --> 42:46.476
A MOVIE WOULD BE
A REALLY GOOD THING
RIGHT NOW, CHARLIE.

42:46.476 --> 42:48.391
WELL...

42:48.391 --> 42:51.046
DON'T SEE ANYTHING
WE WERE GONNA SEE
TOGETHER.

42:51.046 --> 42:53.309
TOGETHER?

42:53.309 --> 42:55.268
YES. TOGETHER.

42:57.139 --> 43:00.142
I SEE WHAT I SEE,
CHARLIE.

43:00.142 --> 43:02.318
THAT'S A FAMILY
UP THERE,

43:02.318 --> 43:04.669
YOU AND DAPHNE
AND YOUR BABY.

43:04.669 --> 43:05.931
NO. LISTEN TO ME.

43:05.931 --> 43:07.323
I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE FEELING,

43:07.323 --> 43:08.977
AND I UNDERSTAND IT,

43:08.977 --> 43:10.979
BUT DON'T DO IT, OK?

43:10.979 --> 43:12.981
BECAUSE WE TALKED,
AND DAPHNE,

43:12.981 --> 43:14.983
DAPHNE GETS IT ABOUT US,
ALL RIGHT? THIS IS...

43:14.983 --> 43:16.942
THAT IS DEFINITELY NOT
WHAT SHE'S HERE FOR.

43:16.942 --> 43:19.161
SHE IS HERE FOR DIANA,
AND THAT IS IT.

43:19.161 --> 43:21.511
I KNOW YOU'VE TALKED.

43:21.511 --> 43:23.513
THEN YOU KNOW
THAT THERE'S NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT, RIGHT?

43:25.864 --> 43:28.475
PLEASE. PLEASE SAY
THAT YOU KNOW THAT.

43:30.956 --> 43:32.958
I CAN'T SAY WHAT
I DON'T FEEL, CHARLIE.

43:35.221 --> 43:37.266
REALLY, I JUST...
IT'S BEST IF I GO
FOR A WHILE, OK?

43:43.359 --> 43:45.187
I'LL BE BACK
IN A COUPLE HOURS.

43:45.187 --> 43:47.668
OK.

43:47.668 --> 43:48.930
OK.
