08:59.289 --> 09:01.291
Fucking rascal!

09:02.709 --> 09:04.544
-No. Stay away from me.
-No, come here!

09:04.753 --> 09:06.797
-Leave me alone! You're not my mom.
-Shut up!

09:16.390 --> 09:18.558
You can't get to Cuba by train.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.644
You can't actually go anywhere.

09:20.811 --> 09:21.979
Please, Esti...

09:22.980 --> 09:24.273
Will you get in the car?

09:24.731 --> 09:25.774
You have a car?

09:25.983 --> 09:27.025
-Yes!
-Yes!

09:27.401 --> 09:28.735
Beverly's.

09:29.987 --> 09:31.655
I'll go with you,

09:32.614 --> 09:34.283
but on one condition.

09:42.040 --> 09:43.125
Watch out!

09:43.750 --> 09:44.710
Be careful!

09:48.130 --> 09:49.631
You're so selfish.

09:49.715 --> 09:52.467
Did you know Jess was up
all night looking for you?

09:52.551 --> 09:54.970
Because she cares about me... unlike you.

10:02.477 --> 10:03.645
I love you.

14:34.791 --> 14:36.501
Slowly.

14:36.585 --> 14:37.544
Slowly. Slowly, yes, slowly.

14:37.961 --> 14:38.962
Slowly!

14:39.129 --> 14:40.380
Stop being such a child!

14:40.505 --> 14:42.924
I'm not a child.

14:43.675 --> 14:46.386
I turned 17 last month.

14:46.553 --> 14:47.971
Did you know that?

14:48.555 --> 14:51.057
But this place makes me feel old,
it makes me feel alone.

14:51.933 --> 14:55.687
When I met you,
I thought my prayers were answered.

14:55.770 --> 14:57.814
That's the only thing I feel stupid about.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.774
Not because of my accent, not because
of my English or anything else.

15:00.191 --> 15:03.028
It's because I thought
you were a blessing.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.035
Oh, my God.

22:37.190 --> 22:38.566
Here.

22:38.983 --> 22:40.485
I found them in-between the cushions.

22:40.568 --> 22:42.111
I'm sure they're fine.

23:03.424 --> 23:05.635
That's good, well...
Even if you don't believe me,

23:05.718 --> 23:08.971
I do feel bad
that you had to grow up so fast.

23:11.099 --> 23:12.892
I know how that is.

23:18.606 --> 23:20.066
I had a daughter.

23:22.276 --> 23:23.778
When I was your age.

23:25.863 --> 23:27.657
I was too young.

23:28.074 --> 23:30.034
I didn't have a partner.

23:30.535 --> 23:34.247
My parents thought if I raised her,
I would screw her up, so...

23:36.332 --> 23:38.251
They took her from me.

23:38.960 --> 23:41.629
Well, really, I let them.

23:42.421 --> 23:46.342
Because I knew that with
that freedom I could finally escape.

23:47.260 --> 23:48.344
From everything.

23:53.599 --> 23:55.518
I haven't seen her since then.

23:58.354 --> 24:00.022
You have her eyes.

24:03.693 --> 24:05.069
That's why sometimes,

24:06.737 --> 24:08.906
when I look at you,

24:09.157 --> 24:10.575
you don't know how it makes me feel.

24:10.658 --> 24:13.494
It's like seeing her and not seeing her.

24:26.174 --> 24:27.341
Are you cold?

24:29.552 --> 24:30.970
Let's see, maybe I have
a blanket here in the back.

48:36.414 --> 48:37.665
Let's go after them!

48:38.291 --> 48:39.709
Gonna trample them. Let's go!
