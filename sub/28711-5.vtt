00:19.454 --> 00:20.803
[Abby]
Previously on Swamp Thing...

00:20.890 --> 00:23.110
It's made out to cash.

00:23.197 --> 00:24.546
[Eddie] So what's this
really about, Sunderland?
Buying a kid like this?

00:24.633 --> 00:25.982
She seems happy here.

00:26.069 --> 00:27.636
[Avery] I just hope to God
she's okay.

00:27.723 --> 00:30.508
That's why I'm keeping
Dr. Woodrue on the payroll.

00:30.595 --> 00:32.249
These numbers.

00:32.336 --> 00:33.685
They can only refer to
the thickness of a cell wall.

00:33.772 --> 00:35.078
So it's either a plant,

00:35.165 --> 00:37.211
or an animal.

00:37.298 --> 00:39.474
And what if I told you
my entries are accurate?

00:39.561 --> 00:41.737
Well, the last
ten million years

00:41.824 --> 00:43.782
of biology would
disagree with you.

00:43.869 --> 00:45.262
As would I.

00:45.349 --> 00:47.786
-Hello, Gordon.
-Got nothing to say.

00:47.873 --> 00:49.440
I know you've been
making off-the-books loans.

00:49.527 --> 00:50.485
[grunts]

00:50.572 --> 00:52.095
[Liz]  It's him I want.

00:52.182 --> 00:53.096
[Daniel] Have you
seen anything more?

00:53.183 --> 00:54.750
About my... mission?

00:54.837 --> 00:56.404
The cards aren't clear.

00:56.491 --> 00:57.970
Not just about you.

00:58.058 --> 01:00.234
About the future
of this entire town.

01:00.321 --> 01:02.062
[Margaux]  I think I found
some debris
from the explosion.

01:02.149 --> 01:03.454
This is from Holland's boat.

01:03.541 --> 01:04.586
Looks like someone shot him.

01:05.978 --> 01:07.154
[Swamp Thing]
I'm scared for you, Abby.

01:08.372 --> 01:09.765
This is only the beginning.

01:14.509 --> 01:15.988
[Maria] Susie's in bed now.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.294
To be honest, I thought
it would take her

01:17.381 --> 01:18.861
a little bit longer
to acclimate,

01:18.948 --> 01:20.906
after everything
she's been through.

01:20.993 --> 01:22.952
But she seems to like it here.

01:23.039 --> 01:24.475
What time
will you be back?

01:24.562 --> 01:26.086
Well, meeting's
first thing in the morning,

01:26.173 --> 01:27.739
so I shouldn't be too late.

01:27.826 --> 01:29.176
[clattering]

01:31.961 --> 01:32.918
Maria?

01:35.965 --> 01:36.966
Maria?

01:38.489 --> 01:40.230
You there?

01:40.317 --> 01:44.191
Oh, sorry. I... I think
that she might be awake.

01:46.018 --> 01:49.457
Listen, thanks, Avery,
for arranging all of this.

01:49.544 --> 01:52.112
Well, you know, it's me
that should be thanking you.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.549
What for?

01:54.636 --> 01:58.161
For funding Dr. Woodrue's
research, you know.

01:58.248 --> 02:00.424
With your help,
he's gonna be able to
keep little Susie healthy,

02:00.511 --> 02:02.252
and a lot of other people, too.

02:02.339 --> 02:03.906
[Maria laughs]

02:03.993 --> 02:05.081
[thuds]

02:09.216 --> 02:12.132
[creaking]

02:14.612 --> 02:16.658
I better go check on her, okay?

02:16.745 --> 02:19.356
Okay, yeah, you better, hon.
I'll see you tomorrow.

02:19.443 --> 02:20.749
[cell phone vibrating]

02:29.801 --> 02:31.977
Put that damn thing out
and get your ass over here.

02:34.066 --> 02:36.156
Yes, ma'am, Sheriff.

02:39.637 --> 02:41.770
[thunder rumbling]

02:44.686 --> 02:45.730
Susie!

03:04.880 --> 03:05.794
Susie?

03:13.497 --> 03:14.368
Susie?

03:16.283 --> 03:18.328
-[breathes heavily]
-Susie.

03:18.415 --> 03:20.591
What's wrong, honey?
What happened?

03:20.678 --> 03:22.854
[breathes heavily]

03:22.941 --> 03:25.422
There was someone
standing there.

03:25.509 --> 03:27.685
-She looked angry.
-Who?

03:29.992 --> 03:32.124
The girl from
the pictures downstairs.

03:35.432 --> 03:36.868
You just had a nightmare.

03:36.955 --> 03:40.132
It's perfectly normal,
new house, new bed.

03:41.395 --> 03:42.918
You're so cold.

03:43.005 --> 03:44.224
I'll get you a warmer blanket.

03:44.311 --> 03:46.095
No, no, no. Please.

03:46.182 --> 03:47.314
Please don't go.

03:47.401 --> 03:48.706
It's just
in the hall closet, okay?

03:52.536 --> 03:53.581
I'll be right back.

03:56.453 --> 04:00.065
You know, I used to
have nightmares when
I was a little girl.

04:00.152 --> 04:02.242
And my mom would always
bring me a warm blanket

04:03.243 --> 04:04.331
and make it all better.

04:07.856 --> 04:08.857
[cries out]

04:10.728 --> 04:11.686
Susie.

04:13.383 --> 04:14.689
Susie, where did you go?

04:19.433 --> 04:20.347
Susie.

04:20.956 --> 04:21.913
Susie!

04:49.463 --> 04:50.290
[gasps]

04:51.900 --> 04:54.772
Shawna! Shawna.

04:56.339 --> 04:57.427
Shawna!

04:58.602 --> 05:00.604
Oh, God. Shana. [gasps]

05:02.127 --> 05:03.738
Oh, Shawna!

05:03.825 --> 05:05.827
[tearfully] Oh.

05:05.914 --> 05:08.395
[in ethereal voice]
You tried to replace me.

05:08.482 --> 05:10.658
First with Abby,
and now with her.

05:10.745 --> 05:11.833
No, I...

05:11.920 --> 05:13.617
[cries] I never wanted that.

05:14.357 --> 05:15.750
It was only you.

05:17.534 --> 05:19.667
Shawna, I love you more
than you'll ever know.

05:29.459 --> 05:32.680
[theme music playing]

06:36.439 --> 06:38.833
[Alec]  Just for
future reference,
yellow tag means

06:38.920 --> 06:42.445
"especially active
mutagenic site."

06:42.532 --> 06:45.622
Note to self.
Check back every week

06:45.709 --> 06:48.886
to assess the insane
plant growth in this area.

06:50.845 --> 06:51.846
Yeah.

06:53.151 --> 06:55.719
Yeah, this is good.

06:55.806 --> 06:58.069
I don't know what's happening
out here, but this is gonna
be good for my career,

06:58.156 --> 07:00.637
I think, and could get my life
back on track.

07:02.334 --> 07:04.293
Knock on wood.
Something's coming.

07:04.380 --> 07:06.121
Something good.

07:06.208 --> 07:07.339
Everything's about to change.

07:08.950 --> 07:10.778
[exhales sharply]

07:10.865 --> 07:12.040
[snarls]

[growls]

07:43.985 --> 07:45.203
[gasps]

07:55.475 --> 07:56.998
What's happening to me?

08:02.482 --> 08:03.787
No.

08:09.314 --> 08:11.752
Stop it.
I don't want to see this.

08:19.107 --> 08:22.284
Make it stop!

08:27.724 --> 08:30.727
[Rob Orbison's
"In Dreams" playing]

08:54.098 --> 08:55.752
[music stops]

08:55.839 --> 08:57.841
[Butler] Hey, how's the fishing
around here?

08:57.928 --> 09:00.801
'Cause the folks in town
said the bass would jump
right up in your boat.

09:01.889 --> 09:03.673
You should leave now.

09:03.760 --> 09:05.066
It's not safe here.

09:07.155 --> 09:08.678
[sighs]

09:08.765 --> 09:11.115
I love it out here.
I really do.

09:12.247 --> 09:13.553
The sweaty smells,

09:14.902 --> 09:17.295
the funky grass,
the blossoms.

09:18.819 --> 09:19.863
The trees.

09:21.822 --> 09:24.738
I swear, when the wind's
just right,

09:24.825 --> 09:26.957
you can hear 'em
whispering their secrets.

09:29.220 --> 09:31.092
The trees...

09:31.179 --> 09:32.702
You can come on
out of there if you want.

09:32.789 --> 09:33.964
The fish are biting,
not me.

09:35.618 --> 09:36.576
Come on.

09:38.882 --> 09:40.188
[low growl]

09:45.367 --> 09:47.587
You're not afraid of me.

09:47.674 --> 09:49.632
Are you someone
I should be afraid of?

09:51.242 --> 09:52.766
Not of who I was.

09:54.506 --> 09:56.465
Of what I've become.

09:56.552 --> 09:59.642
Hmm. Transitions in life.

09:59.729 --> 10:01.122
They can be difficult.

10:02.384 --> 10:04.952
Caterpillar to butterfly,

10:05.039 --> 10:07.824
child to adult...
The process in life,
it's, uh,

10:09.130 --> 10:10.305
it's never easy.

10:13.003 --> 10:14.265
But what's in here?

10:15.963 --> 10:18.095
Nobody can take that away
except for you.

10:19.706 --> 10:22.447
[low growl] Who are you?

10:40.988 --> 10:43.338
[rock music playing
on car radio]

10:54.349 --> 10:56.090
Do it. Do it.

11:03.314 --> 11:04.228
Shit!

11:07.144 --> 11:09.103
Aah! Shit!

11:09.190 --> 11:10.800
[breathes heavily]

11:18.460 --> 11:19.983
All right.

11:20.070 --> 11:22.464
I lived up to my end
of the bargain.

11:22.551 --> 11:24.031
I can leave now, right?

11:29.950 --> 11:31.647
[indistinct whispers]

11:38.785 --> 11:40.482
[whispers continue]

11:46.444 --> 11:47.924
[screams]

11:51.754 --> 11:53.625
Help! Ahh!

11:54.670 --> 11:55.715
[groans]

11:59.675 --> 12:02.591
I was planted here to wait
for Abby Arcane, right?

12:03.374 --> 12:04.419
Well, she's here.

12:05.463 --> 12:07.074
And by the way,

12:07.161 --> 12:09.903
I saved her neck.

12:09.990 --> 12:12.775
But instead of getting
a gold star from my ride
back to Hollywood,

12:12.862 --> 12:13.950
I get this again?

12:15.473 --> 12:17.432
I just wanted a break.

12:17.519 --> 12:20.261
If I had known I'd be
trapped in this hell,

12:20.348 --> 12:22.611
I never would have
made that... Argh! Shit.

12:26.833 --> 12:29.270
Playing you definitely
was not worth all this.

12:30.358 --> 12:31.707
When I get back to LA,

12:32.752 --> 12:34.057
I'm selling your ass.

12:44.894 --> 12:46.896
[moaning]

12:50.944 --> 12:52.859
[laughs]

12:52.946 --> 12:53.903
Oh!

12:54.817 --> 12:55.687
Whoa.

12:56.558 --> 12:57.777
That was a...

13:00.040 --> 13:01.606
What's gotten into you?

13:01.693 --> 13:02.869
I don't know.

13:04.914 --> 13:07.047
[laughs]

13:13.401 --> 13:16.273
After whatever it was that
happened the other night,
I guess...

13:17.927 --> 13:20.451
I guess I just needed that.

13:20.538 --> 13:22.192
But whatever it was
that got into you,

13:22.279 --> 13:23.890
I hope it gets into you
more often.

13:23.977 --> 13:24.978
[Lucilia chuckles]

13:25.935 --> 13:27.110
[Avery] Mmm.

13:28.242 --> 13:29.460
Where you going?

13:29.547 --> 13:31.593
-Come on, Avery.
-What are you doing?

13:31.680 --> 13:32.812
What, that's it?

13:34.248 --> 13:36.076
I got the room till noon.

13:36.163 --> 13:38.687
Well... [sighs]

13:38.774 --> 13:41.777
We both know that
this works best when...

13:41.864 --> 13:43.910
we just keep it
short and sweet.

13:43.997 --> 13:46.738
You know, there's some lines
that we're better off
not crossing.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.523
You always wear that ring,
don't you?

13:52.048 --> 13:53.267
Not always.

13:53.354 --> 13:55.051
I remember the day
I gave it to you.

13:59.055 --> 14:00.709
It might be my favorite day
I ever had.

14:00.796 --> 14:01.841
[Lucilia chuckles]

14:02.972 --> 14:04.191
It was a long time ago.

14:07.585 --> 14:09.239
You ever think about
what might have been?

14:17.160 --> 14:19.510
You mean before Maria
sashayed into town

14:19.597 --> 14:21.991
with her smiles
and the bottomless
bank account?

14:22.078 --> 14:25.125
Thought that Maria
was one of those lines

14:25.212 --> 14:27.083
you're not supposed to cross.

14:27.170 --> 14:29.869
Well, don't you worry, Avery.
You're still calling the shots.

14:29.956 --> 14:31.740
Just like you always have.

14:31.827 --> 14:34.134
[cell phone vibrating]

14:40.531 --> 14:42.055
Ah, shit.

14:43.491 --> 14:45.014
Liz Tremayne.

14:45.101 --> 14:47.147
She already left me
three messages last night.

14:47.234 --> 14:48.670
Huh. Really?

14:50.585 --> 14:52.413
What's that all about?

14:52.500 --> 14:54.676
She's asking about
some evidence
her girlfriend found

14:54.763 --> 14:56.765
up in Skeeter Cove.

14:56.852 --> 14:59.420
A piece of aluminum skiff
with blast marks

14:59.507 --> 15:00.943
and buckshot holes.

15:02.423 --> 15:05.121
Proof that someone
wanted Holland dead.

15:05.208 --> 15:06.906
She's pushing for
an investigation.

15:08.124 --> 15:09.212
Well, what do you think?

15:12.737 --> 15:16.611
I think it would make for
great copy in the weekly.

15:16.698 --> 15:19.353
Ah, damn reporters.
Once they smell blood
in the water...

15:19.440 --> 15:21.311
Yeah. Still, I gotta
look into it.

15:22.791 --> 15:24.575
Gotta solve this
so-called murder

15:24.662 --> 15:28.144
before Tremayne
beats me to it.

15:28.231 --> 15:32.801
[Abby] This sample
is unlike anything
I've ever seen before.

15:32.888 --> 15:35.369
The cells are expanding
and contracting

15:35.456 --> 15:37.849
seemingly at will.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.895
If destroyed, they regenerate,

15:39.982 --> 15:42.376
defying all laws of biology
as we know it.

15:47.294 --> 15:48.904
I can't believe
I'm going to say this,

15:48.991 --> 15:51.124
but based on what I've seen
in the past few days,

15:51.211 --> 15:53.256
I'm beginning to wonder

15:53.343 --> 15:55.650
if we're dealing with
something beyond
the known scope of science--

15:55.737 --> 15:56.956
Like what?

15:58.566 --> 15:59.828
Uh, for instance.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.483
[Abby] Jesus.

16:02.570 --> 16:03.614
Do you ever knock?

16:06.617 --> 16:10.273
I was told I had free rein

16:10.360 --> 16:12.972
when I was provided
hospital privileges.

16:14.843 --> 16:17.585
Wise decision, since our
resident CDC professional

16:17.672 --> 16:20.457
appears to be attributing

16:20.544 --> 16:23.808
the characteristics
of a unique plant specimen

16:23.895 --> 16:25.636
to the boogeyman. [laughs]

16:28.030 --> 16:30.424
Doctor.

16:30.511 --> 16:34.080
The plant sample you
showed me earlier, I, uh...

16:34.167 --> 16:36.647
I need to know
where it came from.

16:36.734 --> 16:40.347
I'm afraid that's a CDC
professional matter now.

16:40.434 --> 16:42.653
Regenerative powers
within those cells

16:42.740 --> 16:44.046
would revolutionize treatment

16:44.133 --> 16:45.874
for a host of genetic diseases.

16:45.961 --> 16:47.397
Yes.

16:47.484 --> 16:49.573
And wouldn't you like
to see your name

16:49.660 --> 16:52.272
on top of the journal article
announcing that discovery.

16:52.359 --> 16:54.317
Dr. Arcane,

16:54.404 --> 16:56.580
did your discovery have
anything to do with
Alec Holland?

17:00.454 --> 17:02.804
What... What makes
you think that?

17:02.891 --> 17:06.199
Hmm. Holland was
the only scientist...

17:06.286 --> 17:09.202
And I use
that word advisedly,

17:09.289 --> 17:11.117
in this backwater.

17:11.204 --> 17:13.684
He had that lab
back in the swamp.

17:13.771 --> 17:15.034
It seems reasonable

17:15.121 --> 17:17.514
that during the course
of his work,

17:17.601 --> 17:20.039
he may have come
across your material.

17:23.172 --> 17:26.262
So, um, does it?

17:26.349 --> 17:28.395
Have anything to do
with Alec Holland?

17:29.178 --> 17:30.005
[chuckles]

17:31.876 --> 17:33.487
[cell phone vibrating]

17:33.574 --> 17:35.141
You know what?
I have to take this.

17:35.228 --> 17:36.403
Excuse me, Dr. Woodrue.

17:38.927 --> 17:39.884
Susie?

17:43.453 --> 17:45.064
No, no. It's okay,
I'll be right there.

17:51.157 --> 17:52.680
Good morning, Delroy.

17:54.073 --> 17:54.943
Mr. Avery?

17:56.336 --> 17:57.946
You're up early.

17:58.033 --> 18:01.515
Yeah, I woke up this morning
with a powerful hunger

18:02.429 --> 18:03.734
for turtle soup.

18:05.040 --> 18:06.128
Hmm.

18:06.215 --> 18:07.173
I took the liberty

18:08.043 --> 18:10.176
of using my key

18:10.263 --> 18:11.873
to help myself
to your kitchen.

18:13.004 --> 18:15.703
Although technically,

18:15.790 --> 18:18.532
I guess it's my kitchen,
'cause I do own the property.

18:18.619 --> 18:19.663
[chuckles]

18:21.317 --> 18:22.971
You came all this way
for soup?

18:24.015 --> 18:25.539
Well, actually, Delroy,

18:26.757 --> 18:28.716
I wanted to see you.

18:28.803 --> 18:30.544
You know better
than anyone

18:31.980 --> 18:35.201
how hard I've worked
my ass off

18:35.288 --> 18:36.637
for this town, you know?

18:40.119 --> 18:41.729
I know folks appreciate that.

18:41.816 --> 18:45.298
Do they? Because sometimes,
I wonder, you know...

18:45.385 --> 18:47.952
Seemed like every time
I'm just about to land

18:48.039 --> 18:49.911
that big white whale,

18:49.998 --> 18:52.740
there's somebody
trying to tear me down.

18:55.699 --> 18:58.137
Take your daughter Liz,
for instance.

18:58.224 --> 18:59.834
Now, for some reason,

18:59.921 --> 19:02.532
she is hell-bent

19:02.619 --> 19:04.752
on digging up dirt
about me.

19:04.839 --> 19:06.667
Mind you, there's nothing
for her to find,

19:06.754 --> 19:09.148
I just need her to
ease up a little bit.
You know,

19:09.235 --> 19:10.801
for the good of the town,
of course.

19:13.152 --> 19:16.372
And I was hoping
that you could maybe

19:16.459 --> 19:17.808
talk to her

19:17.895 --> 19:19.767
and pass on
what we discussed.

19:21.421 --> 19:23.901
In your own words, Delroy.

19:27.731 --> 19:29.342
Taste.

19:29.429 --> 19:30.604
I'd just as soon not.

19:33.476 --> 19:34.869
Taste.

19:34.956 --> 19:36.392
Taste it yourself, Sunderland.

19:39.134 --> 19:41.658
Pops, the contractor's outside
to talk about the repairs.

19:43.704 --> 19:45.880
Go ahead. I'll be fine.

19:47.708 --> 19:49.100
I'll be right outside.

19:51.929 --> 19:54.018
Good morning, Liz.
Would you like
some turtle soup?

19:54.105 --> 19:57.108
You think bullying my father's
gonna shut me up?

19:57.196 --> 19:59.328
Must be hitting pretty close
to the bone.

19:59.415 --> 20:01.765
Oh, come on now, Liz.

20:01.852 --> 20:03.637
Let's not do this.

20:03.724 --> 20:06.074
I've known you since
you were a little baby.

20:06.161 --> 20:07.684
Where's your banker,
Sunderland?

20:10.731 --> 20:11.819
My banker?

20:13.342 --> 20:15.475
Let me see.

20:15.562 --> 20:17.912
Well, I think that man
was exhausted.

20:17.999 --> 20:20.262
And I believe
he went on a vacation.
That's what I was told.

20:22.482 --> 20:24.223
The same night he was gonna
talk to me about

20:24.310 --> 20:27.748
some bullshit loans you made
to the Sunderland Corporation?

20:27.835 --> 20:29.750
A few days after
Alec Holland

20:29.837 --> 20:31.708
went up in flames.

20:31.795 --> 20:34.276
Oh, you've got this all
figured out, don't you?

20:34.363 --> 20:37.018
Let me ask you
something, girl.

20:37.105 --> 20:38.715
If I was really capable
of doing the things

20:38.802 --> 20:40.761
that you imagine
that I've done,

20:40.848 --> 20:44.678
do you really think
I'd let a piece of
bar trash get in my way?

20:44.765 --> 20:46.506
What do you got?
You got a piece
of a shot-up boat.

20:46.593 --> 20:48.377
You got a banker
that went on vacation.

20:49.335 --> 20:50.684
What else you got?

20:50.771 --> 20:52.555
I think that might be it.

20:52.642 --> 20:56.211
So do yourself,
your old man,

20:56.298 --> 20:59.519
and this whole town
a favor.

20:59.606 --> 21:00.781
You leave me alone.

21:01.782 --> 21:03.784
[snickers]

21:03.871 --> 21:05.525
Might have been a time
in this town

21:05.612 --> 21:08.267
when a Sunderland snapped
his fingers and folks jumped.

21:09.659 --> 21:12.271
But that time has passed.

21:12.358 --> 21:13.968
Stay the hell away
from my dad.

21:15.056 --> 21:15.883
[sighs]

21:20.061 --> 21:21.454
You enjoy that soup, Liz.

21:30.201 --> 21:31.638
[frogs croaking]

21:35.511 --> 21:37.557
Ol' Avery built this here place
maybe like seven years ago.

21:42.257 --> 21:43.606
That boy has been
screwing around these waters

21:43.693 --> 21:45.042
for long as anyone
can remember.

21:54.661 --> 21:58.012
You're certain this is where
Alec Holland did his research?

21:59.013 --> 22:01.102
Yes, sir.

22:01.189 --> 22:02.930
Delivered some equipment
to him a few months back

22:03.017 --> 22:06.107
when he was just
getting set up.

22:06.194 --> 22:09.589
Perhaps you should have
delivered him a custodian
as well.

22:09.676 --> 22:12.243
Looks like something nasty
busted up through the hatch.

22:13.288 --> 22:14.637
Tore this place up good.

22:16.030 --> 22:17.379
Must've been big.

22:51.239 --> 22:52.980
What are you rolling
around there, Doc?

22:53.067 --> 22:54.242
[breath trembles]

22:55.896 --> 22:57.680
It's possible

22:57.767 --> 22:59.639
that I've been thinking
too small.

23:08.909 --> 23:10.998
Why have you brought me here?

23:12.347 --> 23:14.349
You sure it was me?

23:14.436 --> 23:16.395
Maybe it was this place
that called you.

23:17.134 --> 23:18.658
Who are you?

23:19.833 --> 23:21.661
Just a passing stranger.

23:21.748 --> 23:24.881
Maybe a phantom
from a dream

23:24.968 --> 23:27.449
trying to help you understand
the things you already know.

23:29.059 --> 23:30.539
You know, some of these
old cypress

23:30.626 --> 23:33.586
can live to be
a thousand years old.

23:33.673 --> 23:35.892
Can you imagine the things
that they've seen
in their time?

23:38.982 --> 23:41.811
You've seen some things
out here, too, haven't you?

23:44.335 --> 23:45.989
I've seen ghosts.

23:47.600 --> 23:48.905
That's one way
to think of it.

23:52.518 --> 23:54.563
-Perhaps there's another way.
-[growls]

24:04.094 --> 24:06.532
[ethereal whispers]

24:10.144 --> 24:11.232
Memories

24:12.538 --> 24:14.540
held by the trees.

24:15.976 --> 24:18.369
And the green

24:18.457 --> 24:19.849
that connects
them all together.

24:21.024 --> 24:22.112
The green?

24:23.113 --> 24:25.638
What you're seeing

24:25.725 --> 24:28.902
are memories of events
that they've witnessed
over the centuries.

24:31.339 --> 24:32.862
You listen close enough,

24:32.949 --> 24:34.473
they'll tell you stories
you won't even believe.

24:37.127 --> 24:38.912
But why?

24:38.999 --> 24:41.480
What is the purpose of
showing me all of this death?

24:41.567 --> 24:43.046
They're warning you.

24:44.744 --> 24:46.136
There's danger here...

24:47.747 --> 24:48.748
for someone you know.

24:51.620 --> 24:53.143
A danger from the past,

24:55.102 --> 24:56.016
returning.

25:13.076 --> 25:15.514
[creaking]

25:24.871 --> 25:26.263
[teen Abby screams]

25:27.395 --> 25:28.744
Shawna!

25:38.319 --> 25:40.887
Shawna! Shawna!

25:42.062 --> 25:43.411
-Abby!
-[teen Abby] Shawna!

26:03.518 --> 26:06.260
Maria. Um...

26:06.347 --> 26:08.871
I don't...
I don't want to fight.
I had to come.

26:08.958 --> 26:10.177
She called you, didn't she?

26:12.832 --> 26:15.356
[sighs]
I begged her not to, but...

26:15.443 --> 26:17.227
You know how she gets
when her mind's set.

26:19.186 --> 26:20.361
I could never deny her.

26:26.410 --> 26:28.151
Uh, I'll make this quick.

26:28.238 --> 26:30.284
I just wanna make sure
she's okay.

26:30.371 --> 26:32.765
She's fine.

26:32.852 --> 26:34.941
That girl has been
a real blessing
for this house.

26:35.942 --> 26:37.030
And for me.

26:40.947 --> 26:41.991
Can you hear her?

26:42.078 --> 26:43.558
[humming song]

26:44.385 --> 26:45.604
Hmm?

26:45.691 --> 26:47.257
Ah, it's just like an angel.

26:49.651 --> 26:52.480
[same song plays on radio]

26:52.567 --> 26:54.395
Are you crazy?
Why did you do that?

26:54.482 --> 26:56.963
It's Smith Street Bridge.
You know what that means.

26:58.921 --> 26:59.835
Go on.

27:01.837 --> 27:02.838
She's waiting for you.

27:20.334 --> 27:23.293
[Susie continues humming]

27:48.101 --> 27:49.972
Hey, Susie.

27:50.059 --> 27:52.975
Abby. You actually came.

27:53.933 --> 27:55.021
I'm surprised.

27:57.240 --> 27:58.328
Why?

28:01.505 --> 28:03.420
Because when people
really need you,

28:04.465 --> 28:05.684
you're never there.

28:08.469 --> 28:10.079
I'm sorry you feel that way.

28:14.040 --> 28:16.695
Do you mind if I do
a quick exam and make sure
everything's all right?

28:18.131 --> 28:19.872
Almost forgot.

28:19.959 --> 28:21.700
You're a big-time
doctor now.

28:27.096 --> 28:28.228
Look at me.

28:31.100 --> 28:32.623
Do you think
I'm on something?

28:33.755 --> 28:35.801
You know I don't
take drugs.

28:35.888 --> 28:37.367
I know,
I'm just checking, honey.

28:38.368 --> 28:39.718
Everything looks great.

28:44.723 --> 28:47.813
That song you were humming,

28:49.510 --> 28:51.860
-where did you hear it?
-With you.

28:52.861 --> 28:54.733
Don't you remember?

28:54.820 --> 28:55.864
It was our favorite.

28:56.778 --> 28:58.562
Windows down,

28:58.649 --> 29:01.043
breeze in our hair,
blasting the radio?

29:03.872 --> 29:04.786
Okay.

29:07.180 --> 29:08.572
Breathe in for me.

29:10.879 --> 29:11.706
[takes deep breath]

29:11.793 --> 29:12.838
Good.

29:14.056 --> 29:15.318
Exhale for me.

29:18.060 --> 29:19.018
Breathe out, Susie.

29:22.543 --> 29:23.762
Susie.

29:26.765 --> 29:27.896
Susie!

29:27.983 --> 29:29.724
You should see
your face, Y-Bee.

29:41.214 --> 29:42.824
What did you just call me?

29:43.912 --> 29:45.827
Seriously?

29:45.914 --> 29:48.003
That's your reverse name.

29:48.090 --> 29:50.049
You were Y-Bee,
and I was--

29:50.136 --> 29:51.050
A-Shawn.

29:56.533 --> 29:58.753
Susie,

29:58.840 --> 30:01.147
did Miss Sunderland
put you up to this?

30:01.234 --> 30:03.932
Susie's not here anymore.

30:04.019 --> 30:06.848
I won't let Mom replace me
with this little nothing.

30:09.720 --> 30:12.071
Okay. Okay.

30:14.334 --> 30:15.944
Convince me.

30:16.031 --> 30:18.120
If you're Shawna,
tell me why you're here.

30:20.775 --> 30:22.429
[high-pitched screech]

30:25.171 --> 30:26.912
[laughs]

30:26.999 --> 30:29.958
[distorted] Save me, Abby.
Save me.

30:31.568 --> 30:32.743
What do you want from me?

30:34.615 --> 30:36.573
To see you in that swamp,

30:36.660 --> 30:39.098
in that filthy water.

30:39.185 --> 30:42.449
Dying, gasping for air,

30:42.536 --> 30:44.538
just the way
that you left me.

30:54.461 --> 30:56.158
You're not Shawna.
Shawna's dead.

30:57.290 --> 30:58.334
'Cause of you.

31:08.910 --> 31:10.869
What the hell
did you do to her?

31:10.956 --> 31:12.653
Excuse me?

31:12.740 --> 31:15.308
Have you been filling her head
with stories of Shawna?

31:15.395 --> 31:17.919
It's the only way
she could have
known our nicknames,

31:18.006 --> 31:20.835
-our song...
-I didn't tell her anything.

31:20.922 --> 31:23.011
She knew.

31:23.098 --> 31:25.753
Xanadu brought my Shawna
back to me.

31:25.840 --> 31:27.624
[scoffs] Madame Xanadu?

31:27.711 --> 31:29.278
You went to her?

31:29.365 --> 31:31.150
She warned me about you.

31:31.237 --> 31:33.239
She told me that
you were gonna
try and convince me

31:33.326 --> 31:35.632
that Shawna
wasn't really here.

31:35.719 --> 31:38.374
That you were gonna try
and take here away
from me again.

31:38.461 --> 31:40.637
You think I wanted
Shawna to die?

31:42.074 --> 31:44.206
You hate me that much?

31:44.293 --> 31:45.207
Get out.

31:46.861 --> 31:48.384
Get out of here
before I call the police.

31:52.823 --> 31:53.999
[Susie] Mom?

31:55.043 --> 31:56.479
Oh, Shawna.

31:56.566 --> 31:57.828
Oh, Shawna.

31:57.916 --> 31:59.743
Everything's gonna be okay.

31:59.830 --> 32:01.006
Everything's gonna
be all right.

32:02.050 --> 32:03.878
I promise.

32:03.965 --> 32:06.359
I can't stay like this
forever, you know.

32:06.446 --> 32:08.230
Soon, I'll have to let
Susie go.

32:09.405 --> 32:11.451
The water's calling me back.

32:11.538 --> 32:15.716
No, honey. I can't
lose you again, Shawna.

32:15.803 --> 32:17.413
I can't be alone anymore.

32:19.763 --> 32:21.243
Come with me
to the swamp, Mom,

32:22.201 --> 32:23.637
and we can be together.

32:24.464 --> 32:25.682
Forever.

32:32.733 --> 32:35.605
[woman on voicemail]
Department of Child Services.
Leave me a message.

32:35.692 --> 32:37.912
Hey, it's Abby Arcane.
Give me a call as soon
as you get a second.

32:37.999 --> 32:39.479
There's a situation
we need to discuss.

32:39.566 --> 32:41.611
[Madame Xanadu] Abigail.

32:41.698 --> 32:43.309
Shawna's come back,
hasn't she?

32:43.396 --> 32:44.963
The little girl
Maria's been watching,

32:45.050 --> 32:46.268
she's in danger.

32:55.538 --> 32:58.063
I'm about to pull up
outside Remy Dubois' shack.

32:58.150 --> 32:59.412
[Cop]  Oh, rat boy?

32:59.499 --> 33:01.196
[Lucilia chuckles]

33:01.283 --> 33:03.285
Harbormaster said
he was actually
working the dock

33:03.372 --> 33:05.548
the night of
the Holland murder.

33:05.635 --> 33:08.073
Thought he might
have seen something.

33:08.160 --> 33:09.813
-Copy that.
-[dogs barking]

33:09.900 --> 33:12.381
Should I send Matt
out your way?

33:12.468 --> 33:14.731
[Lucilia] Uh, negative.
I'll meet him
back at the station.

33:14.818 --> 33:16.037
This won't take long.

33:24.654 --> 33:25.829
Smells good.

33:27.831 --> 33:29.790
Thought you might
be coming around.

33:29.877 --> 33:32.575
[sighs] Why is that, Remy?

33:32.662 --> 33:34.012
You been breaking
some laws?

33:34.099 --> 33:35.317
If I was any good
at law-breaking,

33:35.404 --> 33:36.971
would I be eating a rat?

33:37.058 --> 33:38.929
Hmm. To each their own.

33:39.017 --> 33:41.671
Harbormaster said
you might be stopping by.

33:41.758 --> 33:44.065
Something to do with
that scientist who died.

33:44.152 --> 33:46.415
Logbook says that there was
only one other boat

33:46.502 --> 33:48.983
besides Holland's
that went out that night.

33:49.070 --> 33:50.941
[chuckles]

33:51.029 --> 33:52.726
And you want to know
what I saw?

33:54.380 --> 33:56.556
You were the only person
on duty that night.

33:56.643 --> 33:58.775
[chuckles] Yeah.

34:02.562 --> 34:03.998
Damn strange.

34:05.217 --> 34:08.307
Boat motors out,
20 minutes later,

34:08.394 --> 34:11.832
[clicks tongue] kaboom.

34:11.919 --> 34:14.965
-If that's a murder...
-Spit it the fuck out, Remy.

34:15.053 --> 34:16.880
[chuckles]

34:16.967 --> 34:18.447
Let's just say,
it don't look good
for your boy Matt.

34:25.367 --> 34:26.716
You're a fucking liar.

34:32.592 --> 34:34.637
Funny thing is,

34:34.724 --> 34:37.510
I don't think your boy
even knew I was there.

34:37.597 --> 34:40.121
Office was dark,
I was in the back.

34:41.209 --> 34:43.951
Hmm, I sure saw him.

34:44.038 --> 34:45.866
He's a strapping
young man, Sheriff.

34:47.172 --> 34:48.738
Who else knows
about this?

34:51.524 --> 34:54.614
-Whoa.
-No one yet.

34:54.701 --> 34:56.572
It's gonna cost you
if you wanna keep it that way.

34:56.659 --> 34:58.661
Remy. Remy.

34:58.748 --> 35:00.837
Put the gun down.

35:00.924 --> 35:03.797
Come on, now.
We can just talk about this.

35:03.884 --> 35:05.712
It's about money, right?

35:05.799 --> 35:08.280
Okay. How much?

35:09.498 --> 35:11.674
50,000.

35:11.761 --> 35:13.589
I figure, even on
a cop's salary,

35:13.676 --> 35:15.156
you'll be able
to pull that together.

35:15.243 --> 35:17.071
[sighs]

35:17.158 --> 35:18.768
Well, that might
take some time,

35:18.855 --> 35:20.901
assuming I believe you.

35:20.988 --> 35:23.730
Maybe you'd believe
what I found on that
boat when he got back.

35:23.817 --> 35:25.471
Wrapper from some dynamite.

35:29.301 --> 35:31.346
I figure Mr. Sunderland
might wanna chip in, too,

35:31.433 --> 35:34.480
since it was his boat
old Matt was
riding around in.

35:34.567 --> 35:36.221
So you do whatever
you gotta do--

35:41.704 --> 35:44.142
[breathes heavily]

35:45.882 --> 35:47.493
[choking]

35:47.580 --> 35:50.148
Nobody ever fucking
threatens my son.

36:16.652 --> 36:19.786
10-45, shots fired.

36:19.873 --> 36:22.049
I need a team at the residence
of Remy Dubois.

36:24.269 --> 36:25.748
I'm gonna need
a coroner out here, too.

36:33.626 --> 36:36.019
[Abby] What did you tell Maria?

36:36.106 --> 36:38.326
Her pain was overwhelming.

36:38.413 --> 36:40.763
She could never
let Shawna's death go.

36:40.850 --> 36:43.636
I did what was asked of me,
even though I knew
it was wrong.

36:47.596 --> 36:50.556
You don't actually think
you brought Shawna
back from the dead?

36:51.687 --> 36:53.907
I may have opened a door,

36:53.994 --> 36:57.737
but I think Shawna
would have come
even without my help.

36:57.824 --> 37:01.828
Whatever it is that's making
Susie behave this way,

37:01.915 --> 37:04.222
I knew Shawna
better than anyone.

37:04.309 --> 37:06.267
Okay? That's not her.

37:06.354 --> 37:10.489
Darkness has twisted
her spirit.

37:10.576 --> 37:12.534
She's feeding off
Maria's pain.

37:12.621 --> 37:15.581
[sighs] I just want
to find them
before anyone gets hurt.

37:17.017 --> 37:18.323
You're still angry.

37:19.933 --> 37:22.022
Yeah.

37:22.109 --> 37:24.459
I'm not eight years old
anymore,

37:24.546 --> 37:27.027
watching my mother
live and die by your advice.

37:28.811 --> 37:30.117
Whatever you think
of me now,

37:30.204 --> 37:32.075
I was only trying
to help Anise.

37:34.861 --> 37:36.341
My mom needed real help.

37:45.306 --> 37:46.786
I'm waiting for you, Mother.

38:02.889 --> 38:04.412
[Maria] Uh, I'm afraid.

38:06.632 --> 38:07.850
Don't you love me?

38:09.939 --> 38:11.593
Don't you wanna
be with me?

38:13.900 --> 38:15.293
Of course I do, honey.

39:03.558 --> 39:05.255
Dr. Arcane! [whimpers]

39:06.474 --> 39:07.823
Susie, are you okay?

39:07.910 --> 39:09.042
No, I'm scared.

39:10.652 --> 39:13.394
I think the bad girl's
got Mrs. Sunderland.

39:13.481 --> 39:15.831
I woke up, and I saw her
down by the swamp.

39:17.398 --> 39:19.008
Come here.
Come here.

39:19.095 --> 39:21.794
Take this.
Get Lieutenant Cable.

39:22.708 --> 39:23.796
Maria!

39:28.453 --> 39:29.410
Maria!

39:31.020 --> 39:32.021
Maria.

39:34.807 --> 39:35.851
Maria.

39:40.203 --> 39:41.117
Maria!

39:44.947 --> 39:46.079
Maria!

39:47.559 --> 39:48.560
Maria, stop.

39:49.952 --> 39:51.954
Maria, I'm sorry
I killed Shawna.

39:54.522 --> 39:56.176
She was my best friend,

39:56.263 --> 39:57.960
and not a day goes by
that I don't think about her,

39:58.047 --> 39:59.484
and she died
because of me,

39:59.571 --> 40:01.442
and I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

40:03.139 --> 40:04.402
You're sorry?

40:07.970 --> 40:09.407
You shouldn't be sorry.

40:10.756 --> 40:11.539
You should be dead!

40:54.408 --> 40:55.627
Maria.

40:58.238 --> 40:59.195
Maria!

41:12.513 --> 41:13.775
Maria!

41:28.050 --> 41:29.269
Maria!

41:54.381 --> 41:55.817
[breathes heavily]

42:01.867 --> 42:03.608
Stay with me, Maria.

42:03.695 --> 42:05.958
Come on. Come on, Maria.

42:06.045 --> 42:07.133
Stay with me, Maria.

42:08.003 --> 42:08.830
[gurgles]

42:11.572 --> 42:13.008
[groans]

42:19.667 --> 42:21.930
[Abby sobbing]

42:28.415 --> 42:30.286
She came out here
to be with Shawna.

42:32.071 --> 42:35.727
The daughter
that I took from her.
[sniffles]

42:35.814 --> 42:37.555
How did you know
we were here?

42:37.642 --> 42:38.773
I saw you.

42:39.600 --> 42:41.080
You were in pain.

42:41.167 --> 42:42.211
You saw me?

42:43.604 --> 42:46.912
In the water,
under the bridge.

42:46.999 --> 42:48.566
No, no, no.
That's impossible.

42:48.653 --> 42:50.742
Shawna died 14 years ago.

43:18.073 --> 43:19.074
[tires screech]

43:20.815 --> 43:22.251
[pop song plays on radio]

43:25.690 --> 43:27.605
[both giggling]

43:27.692 --> 43:30.738
Come on, Y-Bee! Enjoy yourself
for once. [giggles]

43:30.825 --> 43:32.740
Are you crazy?
Why did you do that?

43:32.827 --> 43:34.220
Smith Street Bridge.

43:34.307 --> 43:35.569
You know what that means.

43:35.656 --> 43:37.832
-[giggles]
-You can't be serious.

43:39.094 --> 43:40.530
No, absolutely not!

43:40.618 --> 43:42.489
Yes, yes, yes!
Come on, we gotta!

43:42.576 --> 43:44.360
-Shawna...
-We're the only ones who
haven't done the jump yet.

43:44.447 --> 43:46.188
Shawna, it's 5:30
in the morning.

43:46.275 --> 43:47.581
Your mom's gonna kill us.

43:47.668 --> 43:49.148
Please, Y-bee!

43:49.235 --> 43:52.064
I mean, we graduate
in two damn days!

43:52.151 --> 43:54.327
And then, who knows what?

43:54.414 --> 43:59.245
College? Maybe we'll
never see each other again.

43:59.332 --> 44:01.377
You don't always have
to be such a good girl,

44:01.464 --> 44:03.510
you know, don't you
ever wanna be bad

44:03.597 --> 44:05.294
just for, like, one second?

44:08.167 --> 44:10.473
Come on, come on.
Let's do it!

44:12.475 --> 44:14.216
I don't know, Shawna.

44:14.303 --> 44:15.740
Please, Y-Bee!

44:18.743 --> 44:19.831
Come on!

44:24.096 --> 44:25.140
You first.

44:26.489 --> 44:27.665
Abby!

44:32.191 --> 44:33.235
Shawna?

44:34.280 --> 44:35.411
Shawna!

44:36.717 --> 44:37.892
Shawna!

44:38.719 --> 44:39.981
Shawna?

44:41.635 --> 44:42.854
Shawna?

45:03.178 --> 45:04.919
Shawna. Shawna!

45:07.487 --> 45:08.444
Shawna!

45:10.185 --> 45:11.273
Shawna!

45:13.232 --> 45:14.363
Shawna!

45:14.450 --> 45:16.583
[giggles]

45:17.889 --> 45:19.281
You suck.

45:19.368 --> 45:20.543
That was amazing.

45:20.630 --> 45:22.807
You should see your face.

45:22.894 --> 45:24.634
Oh, ha-ha, hilarious.

45:24.722 --> 45:27.376
Fun time's over!
Let's go home.

45:27.463 --> 45:29.291
Or we could just
enjoy the moment,

45:29.378 --> 45:30.728
Miss Buzzkill.

45:34.557 --> 45:36.385
[gasping]

45:36.472 --> 45:38.344
What the hell was that?

45:38.431 --> 45:40.389
-Give me a break.
-No.

45:40.476 --> 45:41.608
I'm serious, Y-Bee.

45:43.958 --> 45:45.046
Shawna?

45:59.800 --> 46:01.236
Shawna!

46:02.324 --> 46:03.412
Shawna!

46:04.805 --> 46:06.067
Shawna!

46:07.416 --> 46:08.591
[gasps]

46:14.467 --> 46:15.773
Something took her.

46:19.864 --> 46:21.648
It happened so fast
that day.

46:22.562 --> 46:23.563
Why that day?

46:24.651 --> 46:26.348
To bring me here.

46:26.435 --> 46:27.480
[siren wailing]

46:27.567 --> 46:29.003
I think it was a warning.

46:30.918 --> 46:32.093
[Matt] Abby!

46:34.922 --> 46:35.967
[low growl]

46:38.056 --> 46:39.318
Abby!

46:41.624 --> 46:43.061
Where are you?

46:43.148 --> 46:44.671
[Abby] Matt, over here!

46:45.977 --> 46:47.065
Abby.

46:53.506 --> 46:54.855
Hold on, Mrs. Sunderland.

46:54.942 --> 46:56.465
The paramedics
are on their way.

47:00.295 --> 47:01.427
You're shivering.

47:16.529 --> 47:19.619
[country music playing]

47:26.844 --> 47:28.758
You're gonna sit there
staring at me all night?

47:31.022 --> 47:32.806
I'm a grown-ass man, Liz.

47:34.286 --> 47:36.244
I can watch out for myself.

47:43.730 --> 47:45.688
Hey, Daniel.

47:45.775 --> 47:47.995
We're gonna see you
at the zydeco barbecue
this weekend?

47:48.082 --> 47:50.824
And every weekend
after that, apparently.

47:50.911 --> 47:52.870
Things are not going
so well at the shop?

47:55.046 --> 47:56.569
It's a video store.

47:56.656 --> 47:58.658
How do you think
business is doing?

47:58.745 --> 48:01.095
Videotapes are just
flying off the shelf.

48:04.533 --> 48:05.534
What happened to your hand?

48:06.448 --> 48:08.146
Burnt the hell out of it.

48:08.233 --> 48:10.713
That's not good.

48:10.800 --> 48:13.673
Hey, Liz, can I
ask you something?

48:13.760 --> 48:15.196
[clears throat] Here.

48:19.244 --> 48:21.072
Do you really like it here?

48:21.159 --> 48:24.989
I mean, really like it here
in small town Marais?

48:25.076 --> 48:28.166
That's a broad question.
[chuckles]

48:28.253 --> 48:29.645
You left once, right?

48:31.952 --> 48:33.693
One thing I don't like
about small towns

48:33.780 --> 48:35.913
is how everyone knows
everyone's business.

48:37.915 --> 48:39.351
Sorry.

48:39.438 --> 48:41.005
Thank you.
And some nuts, thanks.

48:46.488 --> 48:48.577
Yeah, I left.

48:48.664 --> 48:50.188
Studied journalism at Tulane,

48:50.275 --> 48:52.538
moved to New York
right after graduation.

48:52.625 --> 48:54.018
Thought I landed
the dream job.

48:55.715 --> 48:58.326
Fast forward a year,
woke up one morning

48:58.413 --> 49:01.242
realizing I'd spent most
of my time fixing typos

49:01.329 --> 49:03.723
and zero time reporting.

49:03.810 --> 49:07.770
When Pops had a heart scare,
I came back for good.

49:07.857 --> 49:10.556
As much as I wanted
a job on a big paper,
I realized...

49:12.688 --> 49:13.820
I like it here.

49:16.257 --> 49:18.433
I gotta go.

49:18.520 --> 49:21.132
-Have a good night.
-Good night.

49:21.219 --> 49:22.698
Pops, I'll see you
in the morning.

49:22.785 --> 49:23.699
Okay, puddin'.

49:42.457 --> 49:44.155
Oh, shit.

49:51.031 --> 49:52.119
What the hell?

49:52.206 --> 49:53.338
Liz Tremayne?

49:55.601 --> 49:57.733
Sorry, don't know her.

49:57.820 --> 50:00.171
You need to stay out of
the pissing-people-off
business.

50:00.258 --> 50:02.912
Or what? Avery Sunderland's
gonna have to do his own
dirty work?

50:03.000 --> 50:04.523
Look, we're not
playing around!

50:06.046 --> 50:08.614
[groans] Oh, God damn!

50:08.701 --> 50:10.137
[panting]

50:10.224 --> 50:11.269
Tell Avery he needs
to get better help.

50:11.356 --> 50:13.358
Hey, Liz!
What's going on?

50:13.445 --> 50:14.576
Back off.

50:15.534 --> 50:16.317
Daniel!

50:18.058 --> 50:20.800
Daniel. Daniel!

50:20.887 --> 50:22.932
I think you fucking killed him!
Come on, let's go.

50:25.152 --> 50:26.240
Daniel!

50:27.894 --> 50:29.765
Where's Maria?
Where's my wife?

50:29.852 --> 50:30.897
Mr. Sunderland.

50:30.984 --> 50:32.290
-Yes.
-She's okay.

50:32.377 --> 50:34.857
Uh, she had a close call
but she's stable.

50:34.944 --> 50:36.250
Follow me.
Right this way.

50:37.469 --> 50:39.384
Sunderland. We need to talk.

50:39.471 --> 50:41.777
Not now, Woodrue,
my wife's in there.

50:41.864 --> 50:44.041
This can't wait.

50:44.128 --> 50:45.868
[Doctor] Mr. Sunderland,
right this way.

50:47.087 --> 50:49.437
What?

50:49.524 --> 50:52.745
The sample that Arcane
recovered, it's, uh...

50:52.832 --> 50:54.877
It's from a living creature.

51:02.189 --> 51:03.538
We'll talk about this
in the morning.

51:03.625 --> 51:05.410
Hey, hey. Hey.

51:05.497 --> 51:08.717
You want to me to push
this project forward, hmm?

51:08.804 --> 51:11.285
I need it alive
on a table to study.

51:13.418 --> 51:16.421
We gotta track it down.

51:16.508 --> 51:19.424
I'm sorry, could you
just please tell her
I'll be right with her.

51:19.511 --> 51:20.381
[chuckles]

51:26.474 --> 51:27.736
You'd better be right.

51:29.564 --> 51:30.913
I'm gonna give you a name.

51:32.567 --> 51:33.960
Best hunter in the business.

51:44.710 --> 51:45.885
Find it.

52:17.134 --> 52:19.179
