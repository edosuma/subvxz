<i>(Male announcer)
Previously on Hell's Kitchen...</i>

00:02.806 --> 00:04.306
[Screaming]

00:04.341 --> 00:07.343
(Announcer) The chefs had
to catch and cook...

00:07.377 --> 00:08.744
Two different types of meat...
Turkey meatball.

00:08.779 --> 00:10.312
(Announcer)
Their choice of protein.

00:10.347 --> 00:13.349
3, 2, 1, and stop.

00:13.383 --> 00:14.683
(Announcer)
And once again, the women...

00:14.718 --> 00:16.552
Red team, congratulations.
Great job.

00:16.586 --> 00:18.120
[Cheering]

00:18.155 --> 00:19.422
(Announcer) Came out on top.

00:19.456 --> 00:20.923
How awesome is that?

00:20.957 --> 00:22.158
(Announcer)
During punishment...

00:22.192 --> 00:23.526
Come on.

00:23.560 --> 00:26.028
(Announcer) Dan's bad
attitude got even worse.

00:26.063 --> 00:27.363
(Dan) I'm done with you guys.

00:27.397 --> 00:29.432
[Bleep] You and [bleep]
your [bleep] mother!

00:29.466 --> 00:30.900
Put that on TV!

00:30.934 --> 00:33.402
(Announcer) At the family
night dinner service...

00:33.437 --> 00:35.337
Get it in the oven!

00:35.372 --> 00:37.440
(Announcer) The basic menu was
too much for the blue kitchen.

00:37.474 --> 00:39.041
Come here, all of you.
Come on!

00:39.076 --> 00:40.142
(Announcer) Dan's pizza...

00:40.177 --> 00:41.577
Look at that there.
[Bleep] me.

00:41.611 --> 00:42.711
(Announcer) Ray's burger...

00:42.746 --> 00:44.246
It's done cold.

00:44.281 --> 00:45.681
That's my family.

00:45.715 --> 00:46.949
(Announcer)
And Barret's chicken...

00:46.983 --> 00:49.251
For chef James's wife,
pink chicken.

00:49.286 --> 00:50.586
How dare you!

00:50.620 --> 00:51.787
(Announcer)
Outraged chef Ramsay.

00:51.822 --> 00:53.622
Here's the Wellington.

00:53.657 --> 00:54.757
(Announcer)
In the red kitchen...

00:54.791 --> 00:55.925
Mary?
Yes, chef?

00:55.959 --> 00:56.992
(Announcer)
It was a different story...

00:57.027 --> 00:58.294
They're beautifully cooked.

00:58.328 --> 00:59.695
(Announcer)
With Mary leading the way...

00:59.729 --> 01:01.130
I'm the chef to beat tonight.

01:01.164 --> 01:02.965
(Announcer) The women
finished all their orders...

01:02.999 --> 01:04.366
Red team, take over.
Let's go.

01:04.400 --> 01:06.368
(Announcer) Then took
over the men's kitchen.

01:06.403 --> 01:08.404
We're six minutes out
on that chicken.

01:08.438 --> 01:09.638
Get it, bitch!
Get it!

01:09.673 --> 01:11.107
Garnish walking.

01:11.141 --> 01:13.008
This is pretty humiliating.
Now I'm [bleep] embarrassed.

01:13.043 --> 01:14.410
(Announcer)
A frustrated blue team...

01:14.444 --> 01:16.145
Does anybody know
what they're doing?

01:16.179 --> 01:18.114
I never worked with
so many [bleep] amateurs.

01:18.148 --> 01:19.615
(Announcer)
Had to pick two for elimination.

01:19.649 --> 01:20.749
Dan.

01:20.784 --> 01:21.750
(Announcer) And...
Barret.

01:21.785 --> 01:22.751
(Announcer) In the end...

01:22.786 --> 01:25.654
Dan, give me your jacket,
big boy.

01:25.689 --> 01:27.957
(Announcer) Dan's dream
of becoming head chef

01:27.991 --> 01:30.526
at Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill
at Caesars Palace

01:30.560 --> 01:32.561

<i>Get out of here, everybody.
Yes, chef.</i>

02:46.536 --> 02:47.736
[Bleep]

02:52.309 --> 02:54.109
Ooh.

02:54.144 --> 02:55.377
I'm upset with myself
right now.

02:55.412 --> 02:58.581
My mistakes are so [bleep]
stupid, like my chicken.

02:58.615 --> 02:59.748
<i>That's it.</i>

02:59.783 --> 03:01.717
I feel like I let
chef Ramsay down

03:01.751 --> 03:03.152
and I let everybody
on my team down.

03:03.186 --> 03:06.855
That's basically it.
Unbelievable.

03:06.890 --> 03:08.591
I'm just... I'm just
upset with myself

03:10.860 --> 03:12.428
<i>Yeah.
[Sighs]</i>

03:12.462 --> 03:13.596
I mean, what the [bleep], man?

03:13.630 --> 03:14.597
<i>Bring it.</i>

03:14.631 --> 03:16.599
Exactly [bleep] right.

03:16.633 --> 03:18.300
Barret,
you're moving backwards.

03:18.335 --> 03:19.702
You're so defeated
at this point.

03:19.736 --> 03:22.638
Go back to the old Barret
that started this [bleep]

03:22.672 --> 03:24.306
And then step it up
for the team.

03:24.341 --> 03:26.508
Listen, Barret, you could
crumble to the ground

03:26.543 --> 03:27.643
or you could use it as fire.

03:27.677 --> 03:29.545
Do you think I crumble?
No.

03:30.847 --> 03:32.815
I'm here for a reason,
and that's to win.

03:32.849 --> 03:35.351
And from this day on, I'm gonna
bring it every [bleep] day.

03:35.385 --> 03:36.785
But if it takes something crazy

03:36.820 --> 03:38.887
to show chef Ramsay
that I'm serious about this,

03:38.922 --> 03:40.889
then that's what needs
to be done.

03:40.924 --> 03:43.058
(Announcer) While Barret tries to
give himself a competitive edge,

03:43.093 --> 03:44.493
the women...

03:44.527 --> 03:46.228
Blue team is dysfunctional.

03:46.263 --> 03:49.131
(Announcer) Are thinking the men
may not be competition at all.

03:49.165 --> 03:50.833
At this point, we're competing
against ourselves.

03:50.867 --> 03:52.134
<i>Yeah.
Yeah.</i>

03:52.168 --> 03:54.837
Chef Ramsay's just picking
the blue team apart,

03:54.871 --> 03:55.904
pieces by pieces.

03:55.939 --> 03:58.240
Damn, blue team.
Damn!

03:58.275 --> 04:00.643
It's definitely gonna be all
girls in black jackets

04:00.677 --> 04:01.944
this year.

04:01.978 --> 04:04.079
<i>We're gonna make
Hell's Kitchen history.</i>

04:04.114 --> 04:05.948
But let's not get cocky, right?

04:05.982 --> 04:08.317
It's true, 'cause it's easy
as hell to do that [bleep].

04:08.351 --> 04:10.286
We just gotta stay humble.

04:10.320 --> 04:12.521
We need a piece of
the humble pie right now.

04:12.555 --> 04:13.822
We gotta win
that [bleep] challenge.

04:19.796 --> 04:20.928
We'll just rock it out,
red team.

04:20.964 --> 04:22.298
Double time, boys.

04:22.332 --> 04:23.365
Go together,
go together, go together.

04:23.400 --> 04:25.100
Let's go.
Good morning.

04:25.135 --> 04:26.969
<i>Let's go, ladies.
Good morning, chef.</i>

04:27.003 --> 04:27.970
<i>Good morning, gentlemen.
Good morning, chef.</i>

04:28.004 --> 04:30.539
How are we feeling?
Good, chef.

04:30.573 --> 04:31.774
Barret, clean shave
this morning.

04:31.808 --> 04:36.178
Yes, chef.
What happened to the sideburns?

04:36.212 --> 04:39.181
[Laughter]

04:39.215 --> 04:40.382
(Nedra) Like, what the hell?

04:40.417 --> 04:43.118
Barret, you pulled
a Britney Spears on us.

04:43.153 --> 04:44.420
Mm-mm.

04:44.454 --> 04:45.721
<i>(Gordon) Bloody hell.</i>

04:45.755 --> 04:47.156
What happened?
I'm ready to work.

04:47.190 --> 04:48.357
<i>It's not about the look,</i>

04:48.391 --> 04:49.792
<i>it's about my passion for food.</i>

04:49.826 --> 04:52.895
Good. Tonight is steak night
in Hell's Kitchen.

04:52.929 --> 04:54.129
Ooh.

04:54.164 --> 04:55.130
<i>(Gordon) That's right.</i>

04:55.165 --> 04:57.433
<i>This is a legendary night.</i>

04:57.467 --> 05:01.537
So, your next challenge
is all about

05:01.571 --> 05:04.373
creativity with steak.

05:04.407 --> 05:06.742
<i>Thank you, Andi.
Thank you, James.</i>

05:06.776 --> 05:10.346
Chef reveals these
thick-cut pieces of beef.

05:10.380 --> 05:11.347
Nice.

05:11.381 --> 05:13.415
I'm slobbering in my mouth.

05:13.450 --> 05:15.617
Red team, you have seven
on your team,

05:15.652 --> 05:19.254
<i>so there'll be two of you
that'll be cooking together</i>

05:19.289 --> 05:21.523
to go head-to-head against
the filet in the blue team.

05:21.558 --> 05:24.259
Once you get your cut
from the board,

05:24.294 --> 05:27.129
run back into the kitchen,
where I want you to create

05:27.163 --> 05:30.299
the most exciting rubs
to enhance your steak.

05:30.333 --> 05:34.436
I would like all those steaks
cooked to medium rare.

05:34.471 --> 05:40.476
You've all got 30 minutes to
grab and enhance your meat.

05:40.510 --> 05:42.378
Go! Now! Let's go.

05:42.412 --> 05:45.114
(Announcer) Each chef needs to
prepare a different cut of meat,

05:45.148 --> 05:48.917
for which they must create
a unique sauce or rub...

05:48.952 --> 05:51.487
Susie, it's gonna be me and you.
Good.

05:51.521 --> 05:53.889
(Announcer) Using anything
they want from a huge variety

05:53.923 --> 05:55.758
of fruits, spices,
herbs, and oils.

05:55.792 --> 05:56.792
I've got fresh ground black,
if anyone needs some.

05:56.826 --> 05:58.127
Yes.

05:58.161 --> 05:59.895
Everyone have an idea
what they're doing?

05:59.929 --> 06:01.163
Yes.
Yes.

06:01.197 --> 06:03.832
I'm doing a salt and
pepper-rubbed rib-eye

06:03.867 --> 06:05.884
with a blackberry
vanilla sauce.

06:05.919 --> 06:07.820
Blackberry vanilla?
Yeah.

06:07.854 --> 06:11.457
(Ja'nel) Mary is a butcher, and
she's comfortable butchering meat,

06:11.491 --> 06:14.026
but butchering meat and cooking
meat are two different things,

06:14.060 --> 06:15.527
and I'm a little nervous.

06:15.562 --> 06:17.629
It'd be like, eh,
it's kind of sweet.

06:17.664 --> 06:19.298
A little bit, yeah.

06:19.332 --> 06:20.399
Not a fan.

06:20.433 --> 06:23.068
15 minutes to go, yeah?
Yes, chef!

06:23.103 --> 06:25.437
15 minutes left,
15 minutes left. Turn, turn.

06:25.472 --> 06:27.106
Tell me what you guys think.

06:27.140 --> 06:28.407
I kind of want to go
a little bit sweeter,

06:28.441 --> 06:29.541
so I'm going with
banana and mint,

06:29.576 --> 06:31.009
and I'm gonna finish it
with some citrus.

06:31.044 --> 06:32.511
(Anthony) I'm not gonna lie.

06:32.545 --> 06:35.681
I've never made anything
with bananas like this before.

06:35.715 --> 06:38.283
This is complete,
off the top of my head,

06:38.318 --> 06:40.252
praying to God that it works.

06:40.286 --> 06:41.887
<i>Just keep it simple.
Yeah.</i>

06:41.921 --> 06:43.055
<i>(Gordon)
Just over ten minutes to go.</i>

06:43.089 --> 06:44.056
Yes, chef.
Yes, chef.

06:44.090 --> 06:45.457
What kind of sauce
are you making?

06:45.492 --> 06:47.025
A raspberry-chipotle sauce.

06:47.060 --> 06:48.026
Sounds good.

06:48.061 --> 06:49.328
Keep up the teamwork.

06:49.362 --> 06:51.163
I have no [bleep] idea
what I'm doing.

06:51.197 --> 06:54.800
My brain just starts throwing
a million ideas at me.

06:54.834 --> 06:59.004
I'm wondering,
a rub or a sauce or both?

06:59.038 --> 07:01.173
I could really use
some help right now.

07:01.207 --> 07:04.576
I feel like mine sucks.
You know, it's hard to know.

07:04.611 --> 07:07.079
(Announcer) While Amanda
is unsure about her meat,

07:07.113 --> 07:08.947
in the blue kitchen, Barret...

07:08.982 --> 07:10.482
Get in there, baby.
Yeah.

07:10.517 --> 07:12.851
(Announcer) Is taking a
real hands-on approach.

07:12.886 --> 07:14.386
Oh, [bleep], yeah.

07:14.420 --> 07:16.788
Right off the bat, I think, I
love working with black garlic,

07:16.823 --> 07:18.891
so I know exactly
what I need to do

07:18.925 --> 07:20.526
to make this hanger steak
shine.

07:20.560 --> 07:23.929
Oh, yeah.
Look at that.

07:23.963 --> 07:25.430
(Zach)
Barret is about to orgasm.

07:25.465 --> 07:27.099
Massage it. Yeah.

07:27.133 --> 07:30.669
I mean, whoa, just...
Whoo!

07:30.703 --> 07:32.171
Massage it, baby.

07:32.205 --> 07:33.872
Gentlemen!
Yes, chef!

07:33.907 --> 07:35.407
Last five.
Make it count.

07:35.441 --> 07:37.042
Now I just can't
[bleep] up the steak.

07:37.076 --> 07:39.178
<i>Let's go, girls. We can do
steaks, right, ladies?</i>

07:39.212 --> 07:40.479
<i>We can do steaks.
Yeah, we can.</i>

07:40.513 --> 07:41.580
We got this.

07:41.614 --> 07:44.716
Jon, taste this sauce,
please. Grand marnier.

07:44.751 --> 07:46.218
I think you got your [bleep]
right on.

07:46.252 --> 07:48.720
This is what I do.
We're men. We cook steak.

07:48.755 --> 07:50.889
We eat steak.
This is ours for the winning.

07:50.924 --> 07:51.924
Oh, perfect.

07:51.958 --> 07:53.292
Last two minutes, ladies.

07:53.326 --> 07:55.460
Let's get it, ladies,
let's get it.

07:55.495 --> 07:57.629
Man, you're on fire,
for [bleep] sake.

07:57.664 --> 08:00.432
Those peppercorns are burning.
[Bleep], man.

08:00.466 --> 08:02.267
45 seconds to go.

08:02.302 --> 08:04.269
Who got the zester? Zester?
Microplane's over there.

08:04.304 --> 08:06.572
Can I taste your sauce, Nedra?
Yeah, it ain't done yet.

08:06.606 --> 08:07.673
<i>(Gordon) 5...
Up, guys, up.</i>

08:07.707 --> 08:10.108
<i>4, 3...
Nedra!</i>

08:10.143 --> 08:13.845
Bring your steak, Nedra!
2, 1, and serve.

08:15.548 --> 08:18.750
Okay, first up,
porterhouse. Let's go.

08:18.785 --> 08:22.387
(Announcer) Cyndi and Jon are the first
to face off in the steak challenge.

08:22.422 --> 08:25.157
This is a wild-mushroom-dusted
porterhouse,

08:25.191 --> 08:27.759
and I had a black garlic,
thyme, Rosemary butter.

08:27.794 --> 08:28.760
It's a perfect medium rare.

08:28.795 --> 08:30.128
Thank you, chef.

08:30.163 --> 08:32.197
With a porterhouse,
really hard to do.

08:35.168 --> 08:37.602
Really nice flavor.
Beautiful.

08:37.636 --> 08:38.604
<i>Thank you, chef.
Great job.</i>

08:38.638 --> 08:40.505
Good job, Cyndi.

08:40.539 --> 08:41.539
Eh, Jon.

08:41.573 --> 08:43.542
<i>(Jon)
The sauce is blackberries,</i>

08:43.576 --> 08:45.611
a little black garlic,
a hint of lavender.

08:47.146 --> 08:48.113
You know, you've
cooked it a perfect...

08:48.147 --> 08:49.114
<i>Thank you, chef.
Medium rare.</i>

08:49.148 --> 08:50.115
<i>Thank you, chef.</i>

08:50.149 --> 08:51.817
Bold move there.
Blackberries, right?

08:51.851 --> 08:53.485
Yes.

08:53.519 --> 08:54.987
Um, it's paid off. It's delicious.
Thank you, chef.

08:55.021 --> 08:56.855
The point goes to...

08:56.889 --> 08:59.124
<i>Tough one.</i>

08:59.158 --> 09:00.125
Jon, great job.

09:00.159 --> 09:01.326
<i>Thank you.
Well done.</i>

09:01.361 --> 09:03.161
Good job, Jonny.

09:03.196 --> 09:04.830
(Cyndi)
Can't we both get a point?

09:04.864 --> 09:06.665
You're killing me here,
chef Ramsay.

09:06.699 --> 09:07.799
Good job, chef.

09:07.834 --> 09:09.968
Okay, next up,
battle of the filet.

09:10.003 --> 09:12.237
(Announcer) The men are
off to an early lead.

09:12.272 --> 09:13.972
It's now up to Nedra and Susan,

09:14.007 --> 09:15.240
who worked on the filet
together,

09:15.275 --> 09:17.075
to get the red team
on the board.

09:17.110 --> 09:19.111
I have a filet, crusted,

09:19.145 --> 09:21.713
and Chinese peppercorn
and pink peppercorn,

09:21.748 --> 09:25.250
some lemon zest,
with a touch of mustard seed,

09:25.285 --> 09:27.519
I wanted to kind of
also glaze my filet.

09:27.553 --> 09:30.922
Added a little bit of water
to it, some orange juice,

09:30.957 --> 09:32.858
<i>let that reduce down,</i>

09:32.892 --> 09:35.093
and I kind of just marinated
my steak along with that.

09:35.128 --> 09:39.965
Zach used, like, 55 ingredients,
just to make a filet mignon.

09:39.999 --> 09:42.000
I mean, I just don't
really get it.

09:42.035 --> 09:44.569
Temperature-wise, you've nailed
a perfect medium rare.

09:44.604 --> 09:46.371
Thank you, chef.

09:46.406 --> 09:47.939
But is it supposed to be
that sweet?

09:47.974 --> 09:50.542
<i>Yes.
Right. Thank you. Nedra.</i>

09:50.576 --> 09:52.678
I have
a raspberry chipotle sauce

09:52.712 --> 09:53.845
<i>with a little fresh mint.</i>

09:53.880 --> 09:55.213
A medium rare, beautiful done.

09:55.248 --> 09:57.082
Thank you, chef.

09:59.185 --> 10:00.752
Um, tough one.
I can take that heat.

10:00.787 --> 10:01.920
<i>It's delicious.</i>

10:01.954 --> 10:05.190
Uh, the point goes to...

10:05.224 --> 10:06.758
Both of you.

10:06.793 --> 10:07.793
<i>Good job.
Good job, guys, good job.</i>

10:07.827 --> 10:09.428
Thank you, chef.
Good job.

10:09.462 --> 10:12.464
Chef Zach, bust it out,
'cause we got a point.

10:12.498 --> 10:15.500
Chef Zach, I cooked my ass off,
I cooked my ass off.

10:15.535 --> 10:17.903
Next up, New York strip.
Let's go.

10:17.937 --> 10:19.705
(Announcer)
With the men up by one,

10:19.739 --> 10:22.674
Amanda is hoping her smokehouse
barbecue New York strip...

10:22.709 --> 10:25.277
You've forgotten
salt and pepper.

10:25.311 --> 10:27.813
(Announcer) Can defeat Michael's
truffle-crusted New York strip.

10:27.847 --> 10:29.381
That's medium.
What did I ask for?

10:29.415 --> 10:30.482
Med-rare, chef.

10:30.516 --> 10:31.550
(Announcer) But neither dish

10:31.584 --> 10:32.551
impresses chef Ramsay.

10:32.585 --> 10:34.486
The point goes to none of you.

10:34.520 --> 10:35.787
Come on, guys.
[Buzzer]

10:35.822 --> 10:37.155
(Announcer)
And the score remains the same.

10:37.190 --> 10:38.990
Choke-fest.
The rib cap. Let's go.

10:39.025 --> 10:40.425
(Announcer) Now, Anthony's...

10:40.460 --> 10:41.927
<i>(Anthony) Shallots,
garlic, dried banana.</i>

10:41.961 --> 10:43.161
Um, it actually works.

10:43.196 --> 10:44.496
(Announcer)
Goes up against Jacqueline's.

10:44.530 --> 10:48.166
I made a, uh, black garlic,
lemongrass, and lemon zest rub.

10:48.201 --> 10:49.768
The lemongrass
makes it fragrant.

10:49.802 --> 10:53.038
The point goes to both of you.
Great job.

10:53.072 --> 10:55.407
(Announcer)
And the men are still up by one.

10:55.441 --> 10:56.908
Hanger steak.

10:56.943 --> 10:58.610
(Announcer) Now, Ja'nel is
hoping that her dish...

10:58.644 --> 11:01.813
I did an Argentine
chimichurri with orange.

11:01.848 --> 11:03.048
Wow. That's delicious.

11:03.082 --> 11:04.416
(Announcer)
Can take Barret's...

11:04.450 --> 11:06.351
I rubbed it with
some black garlic.

11:06.386 --> 11:08.019
(Announcer)
And tie up the score.

11:08.054 --> 11:10.956
Temperature?
Over.

11:10.990 --> 11:14.226
I just can't believe
you've overcooked the steak.

11:14.260 --> 11:16.828
Point goes to Ja'nel. Well done.
Thank you.

11:16.863 --> 11:18.063
[Applause]

11:18.097 --> 11:20.098
(Ja'nel) Chef Ramsay
gives me the point.

11:20.133 --> 11:21.099
<i>(Gordon) Great job, by the way.</i>

11:21.134 --> 11:22.134
Thank you, chef.

11:22.168 --> 11:23.635
Yeah.

11:23.669 --> 11:25.937
Uh, red team, blue team,
3-3.

11:25.972 --> 11:28.373
And it's all down
to the rib-eye. Let's go.

11:28.408 --> 11:30.409
<i>The butcher and the senior.
Come on, Ray.</i>

11:30.443 --> 11:32.811
Ray's been doing this
for a lot longer

11:32.845 --> 11:33.912
than most of us
have been alive,

11:33.946 --> 11:35.814
so hopefully,
he gets us this point

11:35.848 --> 11:37.215
so we can win.

11:37.250 --> 11:40.152
I have a sauce that's made
with grand marnier.

11:40.186 --> 11:44.256
It's not the kind of thing
you see often with a rib-eye.

11:45.291 --> 11:47.025
Slightly overdone.

11:47.059 --> 11:48.059
[Bleep].

11:50.062 --> 11:51.930
Grand marnier is nice.
I'm amazed that works.

11:51.964 --> 11:53.298
Thank you, chef.

11:53.332 --> 11:55.066
Okay, Mary, let's go.

11:55.101 --> 11:57.502
I did a blackberry
vanilla sauce.

11:57.537 --> 11:59.938
Wow, it's done beautifully,
medium rare.

11:59.972 --> 12:01.239
<i>Thank you, chef.
Really good, indeed.</i>

12:01.274 --> 12:04.075
Good job, Mary.

12:04.110 --> 12:05.410
<i>(Gordon) It's a good dish,</i>

12:05.445 --> 12:07.379
but there's a lot of
blackberry in there.

12:07.413 --> 12:08.580
[Exhales]

12:08.614 --> 12:10.549
The question is,
is Ray's better?

12:10.583 --> 12:11.783
<i>Tough decision here.</i>

12:11.818 --> 12:12.951
One's slightly too sweet,

12:12.985 --> 12:14.186
<i>and one's slightly overdone.</i>

12:14.220 --> 12:15.787
Come on.
Come on.

12:15.822 --> 12:18.690
Come on, Uncle Ray. Bring this
home for the blue team.

12:18.724 --> 12:20.992
The point goes to...

12:22.361 --> 12:24.596
[Cow moos]

12:28.390 --> 12:30.991
(Announcer) The score is
tied in the steak challenge.

12:31.026 --> 12:32.059
Tough decision here.

12:32.093 --> 12:33.294
<i>One's slightly too sweet,</i>

12:33.328 --> 12:34.595
and one's slightly overdone.

12:34.629 --> 12:36.530
(Announcer)
And it all comes down to Ray

12:36.564 --> 12:39.099
and Mary and their rib-eyes.

12:39.134 --> 12:41.635
The point goes to...

12:43.566 --> 12:45.172
Come on. Give it to Mary.

12:45.206 --> 12:47.942
Congratulations, red team.

12:47.976 --> 12:50.511
Yes!
[Cheering]

12:50.545 --> 12:51.512
Thank you, chef.

12:51.546 --> 12:54.348
I win the point for my team.

12:54.382 --> 12:57.318
And I beat Ray,
which is the best.

12:57.352 --> 13:00.821
Ray, had you made
your protein medium rare

13:00.855 --> 13:04.224
like I requested,
you would have nailed it.

13:04.259 --> 13:05.759
<i>Such a shame.</i>

13:05.794 --> 13:07.194
(Anthony)
Thanks to Ray, we lost again.

13:08.797 --> 13:10.097
[Bleep]!

13:10.131 --> 13:13.167
This is so disappointing.

13:13.201 --> 13:14.868
Ladies, congratulations.

13:14.903 --> 13:16.003
Thank you, chef.
Thank you, chef.

13:16.037 --> 13:17.504
<i>(Gordon)
I thought I'd treat you</i>

13:17.539 --> 13:19.273
to something truly special.

13:19.307 --> 13:21.275
You'll be spending your day
by the pool.

13:21.309 --> 13:23.610
Yay!
Yay!

13:23.645 --> 13:27.314
You'll have the most amazing
360-degree view of the city.

13:27.349 --> 13:28.749
<i>Oh, wow!</i>

13:28.783 --> 13:30.851
Oh, my God.

13:30.885 --> 13:33.253
By the way, I've organized
the most amazing manicures,

13:33.288 --> 13:36.490
<i>pedicures...
[Cheering]</i>

13:36.524 --> 13:39.927
Thank you, chef. Thank you.
I love you so much right now.

13:39.961 --> 13:41.695
Hurry up.
Go! Go, go, go!

13:41.730 --> 13:42.930
<i>(Gordon) Well done, ladies.</i>

13:42.964 --> 13:43.964
Thank you, chef.
Thank you, chef.

13:43.999 --> 13:46.333
Whoo! Red team!
Yes! Again!

13:46.368 --> 13:49.737
I'm so happy!
We're on a hot streak now!

13:49.771 --> 13:51.472
Challenge,
dinner service challenge.

13:51.506 --> 13:52.706
This is amazing.

13:52.741 --> 13:54.942
Boom boom
with the hoo-ha.

13:54.976 --> 13:57.378
Blue team,
tonight is steak night,

13:57.412 --> 14:02.383
and I am only serving
the freshest meat available,

14:02.417 --> 14:05.586
so a special side of beef
will be delivered.

14:05.620 --> 14:08.355
It's definitely
a six-man job.

14:08.390 --> 14:10.157
<i>You'll need to break it down</i>

14:10.191 --> 14:13.694
and then prep
each and every station.

14:13.728 --> 14:16.830
Your side of beef awaits you.
Piss off.

14:16.865 --> 14:19.400
Losing challenges
is [bleep] demoralizing.

14:19.434 --> 14:21.635
[Back-up beeps]

14:21.669 --> 14:23.470
Everybody's nerves
are a little frayed,

14:23.505 --> 14:27.708
and everybody's just
on edge right now.

14:27.742 --> 14:29.143
Ooh, that's a big bitch.

14:29.177 --> 14:31.211
(Barret) Another day in
hell for the blue team.

14:31.246 --> 14:32.780
Another day in hell.

14:32.814 --> 14:33.981
<i>It looks like
a half a cow to me.</i>

14:34.015 --> 14:35.315
(Ray) My biggest fear

14:35.350 --> 14:37.484
is lifting the thing,
never mind butchering it.

14:37.519 --> 14:39.319
I'll [bleep] drag it
if I have to.

14:39.354 --> 14:40.721
One, two, three.

14:40.755 --> 14:42.289
All right. We need
to go down real quick.

14:42.323 --> 14:43.323
Where's my step at?

14:43.358 --> 14:45.325
Holy [bleep],
this bitch is heavy.

14:45.360 --> 14:47.828
Hey, guys!

14:47.862 --> 14:51.832
Look at that cow!
Moo!

14:51.866 --> 14:54.068
It would be terrible
to have to hack up a cow

14:54.102 --> 14:57.071
on a beautiful day like this,
but I'm not gonna lie.

14:57.105 --> 14:59.339
Hacking up a cow
sounds like fun too.

14:59.374 --> 15:03.077
[Laughter]

15:03.111 --> 15:06.680
That is a very expensive
steak you're carrying.

15:06.714 --> 15:08.816
Ladies,
enjoy your rooftop pool.

15:08.850 --> 15:10.818
You know, I hope you fall off.

15:10.852 --> 15:12.653
(Announcer) While the
men try to get a handle

15:12.687 --> 15:13.987
on their huge side of beef...

15:14.022 --> 15:15.255
[Groans] You all right, dude?

15:15.290 --> 15:16.924
(Announcer)
The women are excited...

15:16.958 --> 15:19.259
We're number one!
We're number one!

15:19.294 --> 15:21.195
(Announcer) For their
relaxing day by the pool.

15:21.229 --> 15:23.397
<i>Oh!</i>

15:23.431 --> 15:24.965
[Overlapping chatter]

15:24.999 --> 15:30.137
This is the perfect reward...
an exclusive L.A. hotspot.

15:30.171 --> 15:32.639
Excuse me.
Just fanning myself.

15:32.674 --> 15:35.075
Right now, we just own
the rooftop.

15:35.110 --> 15:36.543
Look at the view, seriously.

15:36.578 --> 15:38.946
<i>That view, all the way around.</i>

15:38.980 --> 15:40.447
<i>I've never seen L.A.
like this before.</i>

15:40.482 --> 15:43.183
The boys are really
missing out.

15:43.218 --> 15:44.785
This is definitely
the life for me.

15:44.819 --> 15:46.553
I'm enjoying every bit of it.

15:46.588 --> 15:48.989
To all of our steaks
being cooked perfectly!

15:49.023 --> 15:50.424
<i>Yeah!</i>

15:50.458 --> 15:52.092
[Cheering]

15:52.127 --> 15:53.327
Yeah, what do you think
the guys are doing?

15:53.361 --> 15:56.563
Still cutting up that beef?
Moo-hoo!

15:56.598 --> 15:57.831
Uh, just start here,
trimming it.

15:57.866 --> 15:59.600
Just start cutting it away.

15:59.634 --> 16:01.068
<i>(Zach) I don't know
what's going on.</i>

16:01.102 --> 16:03.437
This is... this is, what?
The flank?

16:03.471 --> 16:07.574
We're all just kind of
staring at it, like, uh...

16:07.609 --> 16:09.309
I know the meat
comes from somewhere.

16:09.344 --> 16:11.111
<i>(Ray) I used to work
in a slaughterhouse,</i>

16:11.146 --> 16:13.247
and I'd cut on this side,
I'd cut on this side, cut here.

16:13.281 --> 16:15.449
The cow's gonna tell you
where it wants to be separated.

16:15.483 --> 16:17.885
Well, he ain't telling me
[bleep] right now.

16:17.919 --> 16:20.320
I'm a good listener,
but, uh, that cow's not saying,

16:20.355 --> 16:22.189
"Hey, cut me here"
or "Cut me there," no.

16:22.223 --> 16:23.757
You have to listen to what
it's saying to you, man.

16:23.791 --> 16:26.593
He... he's [bleep] dead.

16:26.628 --> 16:28.962
(Announcer) While the men
are busy butchering beef...

16:28.997 --> 16:30.330
[Women laughing]

16:30.365 --> 16:31.365
The women...

16:31.399 --> 16:32.733
Yep, this is what
it's all about.

16:32.767 --> 16:35.269
(Announcer) Are busy
being pampered poolside.

16:35.303 --> 16:38.305
Ooh. That's real Hollywood.

16:38.339 --> 16:39.806
We want to get pedicures.
[Laughs]

16:39.841 --> 16:43.010
When chef says "VIP,"
he means VIP.

16:43.044 --> 16:45.112
He means VIP for sure.

16:45.146 --> 16:46.280
Nedra definitely
needs a pedicure.

16:46.314 --> 16:47.748
Her feet are gnarly.

16:47.782 --> 16:51.051
I am going to do a little
mixing and matching.

16:51.085 --> 16:52.786
(Jacqueline)
Her feet were dirty as hell.

16:52.820 --> 16:54.621
It looked like she'd been
walking through the desert

16:54.656 --> 16:55.856
for 1,000 years.

16:55.890 --> 16:57.558
How sexy is this?

16:57.592 --> 16:59.026
<i>Are you ready to go back?</i>

16:59.060 --> 17:00.160
The only reason why
I want to go back

17:00.195 --> 17:01.395
is so we can win dinner service

17:01.429 --> 17:02.796
and make the boys
feel bad again.

17:02.830 --> 17:04.964
[Laughter]

17:04.999 --> 17:06.867
[Sighs]

17:06.901 --> 17:09.102
[Bleep].
This is no joke, man.

17:09.137 --> 17:10.537
[Sighs]

17:10.571 --> 17:13.507
Welcome home!

17:13.540 --> 17:15.842
What'd you guys do
with the cow? Mooo!

17:15.877 --> 17:17.411
(Zach) Here we go again.

17:17.444 --> 17:19.046
The girls are getting
very cocky.

17:19.079 --> 17:20.646
No, thank you.
Do you guys need to cool off?

17:20.682 --> 17:21.647
Facial mist?

17:21.683 --> 17:24.685
I want to whup their asses.

17:24.719 --> 17:26.587
<i>Hey, guys,
why don't you take five?</i>

17:26.621 --> 17:27.621
Go to your patio.
Do whatever you gotta do.

17:27.655 --> 17:28.755
<i>Regroup before dinner service</i>

17:28.790 --> 17:29.957
<i>and just get your heads
straight.</i>

17:29.991 --> 17:32.559
Another stupid mistake
on my part.

17:32.594 --> 17:35.028
I don't think I could get
any more tired of losing,

17:35.063 --> 17:37.097
and today, we know why we lost.

17:37.131 --> 17:38.198
Barret, Michael, and Ray

17:38.233 --> 17:40.100
couldn't keep up
with the rest of us.

17:40.134 --> 17:41.201
It's time to say something.

17:41.236 --> 17:42.669
<i>We can't keep doing this,</i>

17:42.704 --> 17:45.305
"We lost as a team,
we're gonna work better."

17:45.340 --> 17:47.207
All three of you, you know
you [bleep] the team over

17:47.242 --> 17:48.208
on this challenge, right?

17:48.243 --> 17:49.476
<i>Of course I do.</i>

17:49.510 --> 17:50.510
They all better be working

17:50.545 --> 17:52.279
twice as hard as
everybody else today.

17:52.313 --> 17:53.780
This is the second time
in a row, chef Mike.

17:53.815 --> 17:55.582
(Michael) You know, maybe
it's what I need to hear

17:55.617 --> 17:56.683
to get me out of this slump.

17:56.718 --> 17:58.218
I'm just [bleep] choking.

17:58.253 --> 18:01.021
We gotta start getting the weak
people off our [bleep] team.

18:01.055 --> 18:03.090
I just need to gain
the team's confidence back,

18:03.124 --> 18:05.525
because if I can't
cut it tonight, it's over.

18:05.560 --> 18:06.860
Aren't you guys
tired of losing?

18:06.894 --> 18:08.395
Yeah.
I heard that [bleep].

18:08.429 --> 18:10.063
Barret, it's only
gonna get harder.

18:10.098 --> 18:11.832
I know I [bleep] up.

18:11.866 --> 18:13.433
You don't need to keep
repeating it.

18:13.468 --> 18:14.735
[Laughter]

18:14.769 --> 18:16.036
They all want to do nothin'
but work all day.

18:16.070 --> 18:17.337
[Groans]

18:17.372 --> 18:18.605
They don't want to play.

18:18.640 --> 18:19.906
<i>They don't want to
go on jet rides.</i>

18:19.941 --> 18:20.907
They don't want to go
in limousines.

18:20.942 --> 18:22.376
Hey, Zach, Zach, Zach.

18:22.410 --> 18:23.977
No, that's how the [bleep]
it's starting to look.

18:24.012 --> 18:25.412
Zach, enough.
Come on now. Enough.

18:25.446 --> 18:26.647
Un-[bleep]-believable.

18:26.681 --> 18:28.749
I did not [bleep]
do it on purpose.

18:28.783 --> 18:30.284
Enough is [bleep] enough now.

18:30.318 --> 18:32.419
Guys, why you keep losing?
Zach, Zach, Zach.

18:32.453 --> 18:33.987
<i>Shut your [bleep] mouth
right now.</i>

18:34.022 --> 18:35.355
<i>Hey, hey!</i>

18:40.176 --> 18:42.311
(Announcer)
After an exhausting punishment,

18:42.345 --> 18:44.480
the blue team tries to regroup
before dinner service.

18:44.514 --> 18:46.115
Aren't you guys tired of losing?

18:46.149 --> 18:47.883
Zach, enough.
Come on now. Enough.

18:47.918 --> 18:49.718
(Announcer) But it seems
more like they're...

18:49.753 --> 18:50.920
They all want to do nothin'
but work all day.

18:50.954 --> 18:52.221
Enough is [bleep] enough now.

18:52.255 --> 18:53.656
(Announcer) Falling apart.

18:53.690 --> 18:55.891
Guys, why you keep losing?
Zach, Zach, Zach.

18:55.926 --> 18:57.493
<i>Shut your [bleep] mouth
right now.</i>

18:57.527 --> 18:59.328
I'm my worst critic, okay?

18:59.362 --> 19:01.597
You can't beat me up
more than I can beat me up.

19:01.631 --> 19:04.900
You know, I really feel the pain
of being a [bleep] loser,

19:04.935 --> 19:06.235
but you gotta keep going.

19:06.269 --> 19:08.237
You can't let that
beat you down.

19:08.271 --> 19:09.638
Nothing you can do
about it now.

19:09.673 --> 19:11.140
<i>It's already eating me up.</i>

19:11.174 --> 19:13.008
I am gonna make sure
that tonight

19:13.043 --> 19:14.343
we do what
we're supposed to do.

19:14.377 --> 19:15.477
Let's go.

19:19.649 --> 19:21.784
(Announcer) It's steak
night in Hell's Kitchen.

19:21.818 --> 19:23.118
Ready, chef Mike?

19:23.153 --> 19:25.020
I want to [bleep]
redeem myself.

19:25.055 --> 19:27.056
(Announcer) And after
losing another challenge,

19:27.090 --> 19:29.024
the men are eager
to bounce back.

19:29.059 --> 19:31.026
I've got an amazing
feeling about tonight.

19:31.061 --> 19:33.095
(Announcer) But over in the
red kitchen, one chef...

19:33.129 --> 19:35.130
How are you feeling?
You need to rush.

19:35.165 --> 19:36.632
I don't like the blue.

19:36.666 --> 19:39.034
(Announcer) Is nervous about
tonight's dinner service.

19:39.069 --> 19:43.839
I'm not comfortable
with steak temperatures.

19:43.873 --> 19:47.543
Jacqueline is a strong chef,
and she has a lot of knowledge,

19:47.577 --> 19:50.946
so I'm gonna let her
drive the station.

19:51.982 --> 19:53.649
[Bleep].

19:53.683 --> 19:55.217
Ladies, let's go.
Yes, chef.

19:55.251 --> 19:59.121
Line up. Let's go, gents.
Line up, please, quickly.

19:59.155 --> 20:01.924
Tonight is steak night.

20:01.958 --> 20:04.760
Also, we'll be serving
a prime rib, tableside.

20:04.794 --> 20:07.529
<i>The person that will be
responsible for the tableside</i>

20:07.564 --> 20:09.164
will be, uh, Susan.

20:09.199 --> 20:11.133
<i>I want you in the dining room.</i>

20:11.167 --> 20:12.935
Blue team...

20:12.969 --> 20:16.005
Zach, it's yours.
Fine.

20:16.039 --> 20:18.707
I need both kitchens
to be in sync.

20:18.742 --> 20:19.708
(Both teams) Yes, chef.

20:19.743 --> 20:20.743
What do we need to be?

20:20.777 --> 20:22.077
In sync!
In sync!

20:22.112 --> 20:24.246
And I'm not talking about
the [bleep] boy band.

20:24.280 --> 20:28.083
When I say "in sync,"
I mean, in sync, right?

20:28.118 --> 20:29.284
Yes, chef!
Yes, chef!

20:29.319 --> 20:31.120
Set up. Let's go.

20:33.289 --> 20:34.657
<i>Uh, Jean-Philippe.
Oui, chef.</i>

20:34.691 --> 20:37.593
Please open Hell's Kitchen
for steak night.

20:45.101 --> 20:47.369
All right, guys.
I see people walking in.

20:47.404 --> 20:49.938
We'll have to make sure
we know where Susan is, okay?

20:49.973 --> 20:51.707
(Announcer)
Hell's Kitchen opens

20:51.741 --> 20:53.542
for its highly-anticipated
steak night.

20:53.576 --> 20:54.943
I'd be all about
that rib-eye.

20:54.978 --> 20:55.944
[Laughter]

20:55.979 --> 20:57.212
(Announcer) And tonight,

20:57.247 --> 20:59.548
the menu will feature
some classic favorites

20:59.582 --> 21:02.284
as well as some
special appetizers.

21:02.318 --> 21:03.786
Let's go, ladies.
Are we good right now?

21:03.820 --> 21:05.254
Get some fire in your bellies.

21:05.288 --> 21:06.622
On order, two wedge,
one slider.

21:06.656 --> 21:07.623
Yes, chef!

21:07.657 --> 21:08.924
<i>(Gordon) Thank you.</i>

21:08.958 --> 21:10.459
On order,

21:10.493 --> 21:11.727
<i>four crab cocktail, one wedge.</i>

21:11.761 --> 21:12.728
<i>There's nothing cooked.</i>

21:12.762 --> 21:13.729
It's all cold.

21:13.763 --> 21:14.863
Yeah, that's easy.

21:18.535 --> 21:19.635
<i>(Gordon) Barret.
Yes, chef.</i>

21:19.669 --> 21:21.136
Why are you frying crab cakes?

21:21.171 --> 21:22.638
I put two in there before
because...

21:22.672 --> 21:23.972
Yeah, no.
Why are you frying them?

21:24.007 --> 21:25.708
Because...

21:25.742 --> 21:27.376
But there's nothing on order.

21:27.410 --> 21:29.311
I mean, Barret,
how is it possible

21:29.345 --> 21:31.346
you... you've just forgotten
this quickly?

21:31.381 --> 21:33.315
He misunderstood.
He misunderstood, uh, uh...

21:33.349 --> 21:34.616
<i>So, you stop it, right?
Yes.</i>

21:34.651 --> 21:36.685
So, they're still frying.

21:37.721 --> 21:39.088
They're out, chef.
Sorry.

21:39.122 --> 21:40.622
Oh, [bleep] hell.

21:40.657 --> 21:42.558
Let's keep our ears open.
If you're not sure, ask.

21:42.592 --> 21:44.993
I gotta figure out what he's
saying when he's saying it.

21:45.028 --> 21:47.262
Barret, we really need you
in the kitchen here, man.

21:47.297 --> 21:48.697
Like...
[Hollow knocking sound effect]

21:48.732 --> 21:50.099
Hello.

21:50.133 --> 21:51.800
Crab cocktails.
Let's go.

21:51.835 --> 21:53.302
Four cocktails coming up.

21:53.336 --> 21:54.837
(Announcer) With Anthony leading
the way on appetizers...

21:54.871 --> 21:56.105
Service, please.

21:56.139 --> 21:58.140
(Announcer)
The crab cocktails are ready...

21:58.174 --> 21:59.575
It's really good.

21:59.609 --> 22:01.009
Bam, bam.

22:01.044 --> 22:02.478
(Announcer)
And appetizers are quickly

22:02.512 --> 22:04.546
making their way out
to customers.

22:04.581 --> 22:06.415
Meanwhile, in the red kitchen,

22:06.449 --> 22:08.350
chef Ramsay is waiting on...

22:08.384 --> 22:09.384
Two wedge, one slider, yes?

22:09.419 --> 22:12.654
Walking, chef.
Chef, two wedges.

22:12.689 --> 22:15.858
Come on, Mary!
One slider!

22:15.892 --> 22:18.494
Is a slider on?
No, chef!

22:19.863 --> 22:22.431
Stop, stop. Hey, you.
Hey, you. [Bleep] come here.

22:22.465 --> 22:23.465
<i>And you come here.
Yes, chef!</i>

22:23.500 --> 22:24.933
I've called out
the slider already.

22:24.968 --> 22:26.769
Why is it not on?
I didn't hear you, chef.

22:26.803 --> 22:28.403
I'm sorry, chef.
I'll put it on right now.

22:28.438 --> 22:29.772
No, it's not good enough
right now!

22:29.806 --> 22:33.275
When the slider is called out,
what should happen?

22:33.309 --> 22:34.510
I should put it on
right away, chef!

22:34.544 --> 22:36.845
Right. So we're backed up!
Wake up!

22:36.880 --> 22:38.614
Yes, chef!
Yes, chef!

22:38.648 --> 22:40.649
Start again.

22:40.683 --> 22:42.851
[Bleep] Mary.

22:42.886 --> 22:44.286
I'm sorry.
I didn't hear.

22:44.320 --> 22:45.854
Just get it together.

22:45.889 --> 22:47.256
We need to push these apps out.

22:47.290 --> 22:48.590
If you're behind,
that makes me behind.

22:48.625 --> 22:50.425
Mary!
I'm ready to walk!

22:50.460 --> 22:51.894
Okay.

22:53.096 --> 22:57.166
Here's the sliders, chef.

22:57.200 --> 22:58.734
Let's go.
Service, please.

22:58.768 --> 23:01.069
(Announcer) Mary's sliders
finally leave the kitchen.

23:01.104 --> 23:02.137
Come on, ladies, pick it up.

23:02.172 --> 23:03.205
(Announcer) Unfortunately...

23:03.239 --> 23:05.507
Um, I found a hair in my food.

23:05.542 --> 23:07.509
(Announcer) They contain a
little something extra.

23:07.544 --> 23:09.178
It's pretty disgusting.

23:09.212 --> 23:11.213
<i>We're gonna have to
take that back.</i>

23:11.247 --> 23:13.048
Chef, I'm... I'm sorry.

23:13.082 --> 23:14.449
There's a hair
in between her burger.

23:14.484 --> 23:17.052
[Bleep].
Hey!

23:17.086 --> 23:19.454
Hey, all of you, come here.

23:19.489 --> 23:21.824
Oh, my gosh.

23:22.926 --> 23:24.459
<i>[Groans] Aw, man.</i>

23:24.494 --> 23:26.995
[Bleep] Almighty.
A [bleep] hair?

23:27.030 --> 23:28.797
Re-fire urgently.

23:28.832 --> 23:30.299
Yes, chef!

23:30.333 --> 23:31.500
I guess it could have
been my hair.

23:31.534 --> 23:32.534
My hair is really long.

23:32.569 --> 23:33.769
Is that the best you can do?

23:33.803 --> 23:35.604
No, chef!
I can do better!

23:35.638 --> 23:38.974
I [bleep] want better!
Yes, chef!

23:39.008 --> 23:41.977
(Announcer) While Mary
starts over on her sliders,

23:42.011 --> 23:43.612
back in the blue kitchen...
Tuna.

23:43.646 --> 23:46.915
The men have served almost
all of their appetizers...

23:46.950 --> 23:48.550
Three crab cake, one tuna.
Yes, chef.

23:48.585 --> 23:50.419
(Announcer)
And are moving on to entrees.

23:50.453 --> 23:51.920
<i>(Gordon)
First entree, three bass,</i>

23:51.955 --> 23:53.488

23:53.523 --> 23:55.257
Yes, chef!
Yes, chef!

23:55.291 --> 23:56.558
(Announcer)
But Barret, who's responsible

23:56.593 --> 23:59.361
for the garnish for the
appetizers and the entrees...

23:59.395 --> 24:00.762
I feel like I'm dying
right now.

24:00.797 --> 24:02.130
(Announcer)
Is feeling the pressure.

24:02.165 --> 24:03.632
I gotta make fries.
Barret, you got fries. Drop.

24:03.666 --> 24:04.967
I gotta do this.

24:05.001 --> 24:06.568
Barret, let me know when
you're up on one crab cake.

24:06.603 --> 24:08.871
<i>I gotta do that.
How long on the sides, Barret?</i>

24:08.905 --> 24:10.339
Holy [bleep].

24:10.373 --> 24:12.441
How long do you need?
I need... give me... I need three minutes.

24:12.475 --> 24:15.544
Somebody get me the [bleep]
out of here now.

24:15.578 --> 24:17.379
<i>Barret, are you walking
with the crab cake right now?</i>

24:17.413 --> 24:19.414
Walking up.

24:21.618 --> 24:24.119
Salad, please,
for the crab cakes.

24:24.153 --> 24:25.954
<i>(Gordon) Barret! Yes, chef.</i>

24:25.989 --> 24:28.056
When you bring up
your appetizer,

24:28.091 --> 24:29.324
you have to complete it.

24:29.359 --> 24:31.159
<i>Yes, chef.
Right now, I haven't got time.</i>

24:31.194 --> 24:35.063
Barret, salad. Barret, salad.
Barret, salad. [Bleep]!

24:35.098 --> 24:36.131
<i>(Barret) Yes, chef.</i>

24:36.165 --> 24:37.132
When you bring
the [bleep] crab cake,

24:37.166 --> 24:38.300
you should bring
the salad, right?

24:38.334 --> 24:39.935
Yes, chef!
My fault, chef.

24:39.969 --> 24:42.938
Barret, what is this? The first
[bleep] day on the job?

24:42.972 --> 24:44.439
I mean, how do you
forget a salad?

24:44.474 --> 24:46.642
Tell me what you need, Barret.
A bowl. A mixing bowl.

24:46.676 --> 24:49.378
[Bleep]!

24:49.412 --> 24:52.447
I need Barret to calm down
and just push the food out.

24:52.482 --> 24:54.850
Let's go, let's go.
Walking up.

24:54.884 --> 24:56.118
Crab cake salad.

24:56.152 --> 24:57.519
Service, please!

24:57.553 --> 24:59.988
<i>(Gordon) One filet andouille.</i>

25:00.023 --> 25:01.723
Garnish, hanger steak.

25:01.758 --> 25:03.825
<i>Keep working, guys.
Keep working. Come on.</i>

25:03.860 --> 25:05.394
I'm putting together sides
right now.

25:05.428 --> 25:06.528
I'm going with meat, Barret.

25:06.562 --> 25:08.330
Going with meat, Barret.

25:08.364 --> 25:10.232
Where's the bass?

25:10.266 --> 25:11.600
Bass in my hands, chef.

25:11.634 --> 25:13.468
Garnish walking to
the window. You good?

25:13.503 --> 25:14.670
Absolutely.

25:17.106 --> 25:18.540
Service, please.

25:19.943 --> 25:22.644
Ah! I'm exhausted right now.

25:22.679 --> 25:24.813
It's like I got hit
by an 18-Wheeler.

25:24.847 --> 25:27.549
Everybody stay awake.
All right? Wake up.

25:27.583 --> 25:28.583
(Announcer)
While the men dig deep,

25:28.618 --> 25:29.985
over in the red kitchen...

25:30.019 --> 25:31.420
Slider. How long?

25:31.454 --> 25:33.755
(Announcer) The women are
still buried with appetizers.

25:33.790 --> 25:35.457
Slider!
Coming, chef!

25:35.491 --> 25:38.160
Do you need me to walk that, Mary?
I'll walk it.

25:38.194 --> 25:39.695
(Mary) I just want to
get the sliders out

25:39.729 --> 25:41.229
so I don't have to sit here,
embarrassed anymore

25:41.264 --> 25:42.965
about the hair in my slider.

25:42.999 --> 25:44.399
Here's the slider, chef.

25:48.171 --> 25:50.138
Let's go.

25:50.173 --> 25:52.140
(Announcer) With Mary's sliders
passing inspection by chef Ramsay...

25:52.175 --> 25:53.342
<i>It it good?
It's good.</i>

25:53.376 --> 25:54.643
(Announcer) And the diners...

25:54.677 --> 25:56.545
<i>Good job, Mary.
Are you girls ready?</i>

25:56.579 --> 25:58.046
I'm ready.
I'm walking.

25:58.081 --> 26:00.849
(Announcer)
The women are back on track...

26:00.883 --> 26:02.985
Taste the crab.
That is good.

26:03.019 --> 26:04.286
(Announcer)
Finishing appetizers...

26:04.320 --> 26:05.587
<i>(Susan)
I'm gonna go set myself up</i>

26:05.621 --> 26:07.389
in the dining room, okay?

26:07.423 --> 26:08.991
(Announcer)
And moving on to entrees.

26:09.025 --> 26:10.759
Two rib-eye, one porterhouse,
one prime rib.

26:10.793 --> 26:12.060
Yes, chef!
Yes, chef!

26:12.095 --> 26:14.463
Me and Amanda are on
the meat station this evening.

26:14.497 --> 26:15.964
We have all the pressure on us.

26:15.999 --> 26:19.067
First order, I'm ready to go.
We're waiting for Susan.

26:19.102 --> 26:20.602
I don't want chef Ramsay
riding on me tonight.

26:20.636 --> 26:22.971
I don't want Amanda
second-guessing herself.

26:23.006 --> 26:24.306
Get it right, guys.
Get the timing right.

26:24.340 --> 26:26.975
<i>Let's go, guys.
Walking to the table.</i>

26:27.010 --> 26:28.210
Let's go. Prime rib, Susan.
Let's go.

26:28.244 --> 26:30.812
<i>She's going to the table.
Wake up.</i>

26:30.847 --> 26:32.481
Who's having the, uh,
prime rib?

26:36.719 --> 26:40.255
Hey, pedicure, manicure,
how long?

26:40.289 --> 26:43.492
We're waiting for Susan.

26:43.526 --> 26:44.626
No. [Bleep] you.

26:44.660 --> 26:47.496
She's slicing the prime rib

26:47.530 --> 26:51.233
<i>and you just stopped
the whole [bleep] kitchen.</i>

26:51.267 --> 26:52.401
All of you!

26:53.403 --> 26:54.403
Susan!
Yes, chef!

26:54.437 --> 26:55.871
Come here, you!

26:55.905 --> 26:58.807
I know everyone keeps saying
Jacqueline's this amazing chef,

26:58.841 --> 26:59.808
she's so strong.

26:59.842 --> 27:01.643
Yes, chef.

27:01.677 --> 27:03.979
You just stopped
sending entrees.

27:04.013 --> 27:05.614
Did you tell her to stop?
No.

27:05.648 --> 27:07.516
Oh, really?

27:07.550 --> 27:10.986
(Susan) But if you can't perform
when the lights turn on,

27:11.020 --> 27:12.421
then it's worthless.

27:12.455 --> 27:15.924
We're now stopping serving meat
that we're dying for.

27:15.958 --> 27:18.060
Have you ever of anything
so [bleep] stupid?

27:18.094 --> 27:19.161
No.

27:19.195 --> 27:20.328
Unless you give me your best,

27:20.363 --> 27:22.631
<i>go home!</i>

27:23.733 --> 27:24.766
Over!

27:30.604 --> 27:32.872
(Announcer) It's over an
hour into dinner service,

27:32.906 --> 27:35.007
and diners on the red side
are wondering

27:35.042 --> 27:36.776
where their entrees are.

27:36.810 --> 27:38.478
I'm hungry.
I'm definitely hungry.

27:38.512 --> 27:39.745
(Announcer) And in the kitchen,

27:39.780 --> 27:42.448
chef Ramsay is wondering
the same thing.

27:42.483 --> 27:45.952
We're now stopping serving meat
that we're dying for.

27:45.986 --> 27:48.087
Have you ever of anything
so [bleep] stupid?

27:48.122 --> 27:49.188
No.

27:49.223 --> 27:50.356
Unless you give me your best,

27:50.390 --> 27:52.658
<i>go home!</i>

27:54.228 --> 27:55.695
Over!
Yes, chef.

27:55.729 --> 27:56.696
<i>(Gordon) Get it together.</i>

27:56.730 --> 27:58.030
Have a little meeting.

27:58.065 --> 27:59.565
I know what table was next.

27:59.600 --> 28:01.067
Okay.
If I need to rush, I can rush.

28:01.101 --> 28:02.568
Hurry up!
Yes, chef!

28:02.603 --> 28:03.703
Go, guys.
Keep it up.

28:03.737 --> 28:05.304
Porterhouse ready
in two minutes, chef.

28:06.306 --> 28:07.607
Oh, yeah.

28:07.641 --> 28:09.108
They actually
just stopped cooking.

28:09.143 --> 28:10.409
I don't know why, but they did.

28:10.444 --> 28:13.279
Walking. Walking.

28:13.313 --> 28:14.413
(Announcer) With Jacqueline
back to cooking,

28:14.448 --> 28:16.249
steak dishes are now flowing

28:16.283 --> 28:17.316
out of the kitchen.

28:17.351 --> 28:18.584
Enjoy everything.
Enjoy.

28:18.619 --> 28:19.585
(Announcer) Diners...

28:19.620 --> 28:20.853
Mmm!
Melts in your mouth.

28:20.888 --> 28:22.555
(Announcer) Are satisfied.

28:22.589 --> 28:24.457
And back in the blue kitchen...

28:24.491 --> 28:26.926
Entree, two filet,
one New York, one prime rib.

28:26.960 --> 28:28.461
Yes, chef!
Yes, chef!

28:28.495 --> 28:30.163
(Announcer) Chef Ramsay is
looking to Ray and Michael

28:30.197 --> 28:31.831
to deliver on the meat station.

28:31.865 --> 28:35.067
Let's go, Ray. I want to
hear you. Hey, hello!

28:35.102 --> 28:37.603
<i>No more senior moments tonight.</i>

28:37.638 --> 28:38.704
<i>No, chef.
Ray!</i>

28:38.739 --> 28:40.239
Do you understand?
Yes, chef.

28:40.274 --> 28:42.742
I think he likes me,
to be honest with you.

28:42.776 --> 28:43.809
<i>(Gordon) Ray, I'm done.</i>

28:43.844 --> 28:45.678
I understand, chef.

28:45.712 --> 28:47.380
We're almost
the [bleep] same age.

28:47.414 --> 28:48.614
Ray, watch those steaks!

28:48.649 --> 28:50.082
(Ray) I think he likes
breaking my [bleep].

28:50.117 --> 28:51.617
Let's go.
Ray, hurry up.

28:51.652 --> 28:53.419
All right.
Come on. Some speed now!

28:53.453 --> 28:55.488
<i>I'm going with meat.
Come on, come on, please.</i>

28:55.522 --> 28:57.123
Rib-eye, two filet, chef.

28:57.157 --> 28:58.758
Sauces.

28:58.792 --> 29:01.594
(Michael) Ray and I need a
perfect batting average tonight.

29:01.628 --> 29:04.063
We can't have a single problem
or it's gonna be trouble.

29:04.097 --> 29:05.131
Give me a knife, please.

29:07.801 --> 29:10.369
That is [bleep] raw.

29:10.404 --> 29:12.905
[Bleep] off.

29:12.940 --> 29:16.309
Hey, raw New York.

29:16.343 --> 29:18.144
Aw, [bleep] me.

29:18.178 --> 29:20.513
Oh, my God. We just
can't catch a break.

29:20.547 --> 29:23.449
Come here, you.
Just [bleep] come here.

29:23.483 --> 29:25.017
Who cooked it?

29:25.052 --> 29:26.652
I cooked it.
Answer!

29:26.687 --> 29:27.920
I did, chef.
I cooked it.

29:27.955 --> 29:29.989
I'll take...
I-I did it, chef.

29:30.023 --> 29:32.325
This is where it's going
so [bleep] badly.

29:32.359 --> 29:34.093
Yes, chef.

29:34.127 --> 29:36.095
<i>Not even rendered in there.
I understand, chef.</i>

29:36.129 --> 29:37.530
Two of you on the same section!

29:37.564 --> 29:39.365
Do we have any fight left?

29:39.399 --> 29:40.399
[Overlapping chatter]

29:40.434 --> 29:41.534
If you need to switch, switch.

29:41.568 --> 29:42.835
<i>I'm gonna cook.
I'm gonna cook.</i>

29:42.869 --> 29:45.171
Ray, Michael, pull your heads
out of your [bleep]

29:45.205 --> 29:46.372
and cook the [bleep] meat.

29:46.406 --> 29:48.808
Dude, do [bleep]
New York strip, okay?

29:48.842 --> 29:50.076
I got it on.

29:50.110 --> 29:51.077
<i>(Ray) Don't rush the steaks.</i>

29:51.111 --> 29:53.412
Ray, please stop talking.

29:53.447 --> 29:55.948
Let me [bleep] cook
the meat. I got it.

29:55.983 --> 29:57.483
How long for that
New York strip?

29:57.517 --> 29:59.118
3 1/2, chef.
Oh, [bleep].

29:59.152 --> 30:01.120
Take the table back.

30:01.154 --> 30:02.688
Oh, [bleep] me.

30:02.723 --> 30:04.123
Ray.
Yeah?

30:04.157 --> 30:05.958
Yeah, [bleep] off.
Take that.

30:05.993 --> 30:09.662
Take it.
It's a [bleep] joke.

30:09.696 --> 30:11.430
(Anthony) The meat station,
we're drowning here,

30:11.465 --> 30:13.766
and you're the weight
wrapped around our ankle.

30:13.800 --> 30:14.767
Come on.

30:14.801 --> 30:16.469
One half, I can live with.

30:16.503 --> 30:17.470
<i>I can go out there
and kiss their ass.</i>

30:17.504 --> 30:18.604
Right, chef.

30:18.639 --> 30:19.605
<i>(Gordon)
I mean, for God's sake!</i>

30:19.640 --> 30:20.940
(Announcer) While the blue team

30:20.974 --> 30:23.209
re-fires an entire table,

30:23.243 --> 30:25.678
chef Ramsay looks
to the red team for...

30:25.712 --> 30:28.114
Two filet, one bass,
two prime rib.

30:28.148 --> 30:30.783
Bass if good if you're ready
for the two filet, one bass.

30:30.817 --> 30:31.984
Where's the two filet at?
In the oven?

30:32.019 --> 30:33.586
Did you hear me?
Amanda and Jacqueline.

30:33.620 --> 30:34.887
<i>How long?
Four minutes, chef.</i>

30:34.921 --> 30:36.555
Waiting on bass.

30:36.590 --> 30:38.958
Oh, my God.
Waiting on bass.

30:38.992 --> 30:40.226
This one is ready.

30:40.260 --> 30:42.194
If they're ready to go,
I'll take this one.

30:42.229 --> 30:43.396
[Overlapping shouting]

30:43.430 --> 30:45.631
I told them, chef.

30:45.666 --> 30:47.767
Meat is totally
screwing me right now.

30:47.801 --> 30:50.636
Did she tell you that?
No, chef.

30:50.671 --> 30:53.105
Aah! Are you
kidding me right now?

30:53.140 --> 30:55.574
Amanda, just say
that you made a mistake.

30:55.609 --> 30:56.676
Like, man up.

30:56.710 --> 30:58.911
Why have you stopped
talking to each other?

30:58.945 --> 31:01.180
Give us one minute!
Let's go, then!

31:01.214 --> 31:02.882
<i>Let's go!
Walk up the filets!</i>

31:02.916 --> 31:04.583
<i>Ladies, are you ready?
Yeah.</i>

31:04.618 --> 31:06.252
<i>Ready, ready!</i>

31:08.255 --> 31:09.221
Two filets.

31:09.256 --> 31:12.291
Raw, raw, [bleep] raw.

31:15.062 --> 31:17.196
Aw, [bleep] now.

31:17.230 --> 31:18.564
[Bleep] my life.

31:18.598 --> 31:19.565
<i>(Gordon) Raw filet.</i>

31:19.599 --> 31:21.400
The easiest to cook.

31:21.435 --> 31:24.136
The most glamorous,
the most in demand.

31:24.171 --> 31:26.339
Cold and raw.

31:26.373 --> 31:29.542
(Amanda) Jacqueline says
they're good, I trust her,

31:29.576 --> 31:31.610

31:31.645 --> 31:33.446
<i>(Gordon) Raw in the middle!</i>

31:33.480 --> 31:36.382
Hey, Amanda.
Yes, chef.

31:36.416 --> 31:38.150
It's not Sushi night,
it's steak night!

31:38.185 --> 31:39.652
Yes, chef!

31:39.686 --> 31:41.487
(Jacqueline) Amanda doesn't
know how to temp meat,

31:41.521 --> 31:42.922
so me putting trust in people

31:42.956 --> 31:44.590
obviously is
the wrong thing to do.

31:44.624 --> 31:46.692
It won't ever happen again.

31:46.727 --> 31:48.761
[Dish crashes]

31:48.795 --> 31:49.762
Do we have another one?

31:49.796 --> 31:50.763
Yes, I have another one.

31:50.797 --> 31:52.798
Oh, [bleep] me.

31:52.833 --> 31:54.767
Filet!
Yes, chef!

31:54.801 --> 31:56.469
Oh, my God!

31:56.503 --> 31:58.871
You gotta sear the filets
on all sides!

31:58.905 --> 32:00.373
I know!

32:00.407 --> 32:01.540
You gotta sear the thing
on all sides!

32:01.575 --> 32:04.310
I did!
So why they... why they raw?

32:04.344 --> 32:06.946

hard it is to cook steaks.

32:06.980 --> 32:08.347
[Pan clatters]

32:08.382 --> 32:10.149

One filet!

32:11.251 --> 32:13.986

<i>(Nedra) Now chef is
chewing our ass up,</i>

32:15.455 --> 32:17.156

on the re-cook.

32:17.190 --> 32:18.891

32:21.695 --> 32:24.930
three different ladies
cooking the same steak

32:24.965 --> 32:25.931

32:25.966 --> 32:27.032
Yes, chef.

32:27.067 --> 32:28.701
Good.

32:28.735 --> 32:30.136

32:30.170 --> 32:32.705

Sorry, chef. Hot.

32:46.987 --> 32:49.655

32:49.689 --> 32:51.490
It's [bleep] raw, chef.

32:51.525 --> 32:53.993
That's right.
It's [bleep] raw!

32:54.027 --> 32:56.295

am I getting kicked out for?

33:34.691 --> 33:36.291
Chef, are you [bleep]
kidding me right now?

33:36.326 --> 33:39.027
You're kicking me out
because Jacqueline and Amanda

33:39.062 --> 33:40.496
can't cook a [bleep] filet?

33:40.530 --> 33:45.701
I'm mad like a [bleep]!
I am so mad right now!

33:45.735 --> 33:46.835

Amanda, what are you doing?

34:16.498 --> 34:17.766
(Announcer) Is clearly divided.

34:17.801 --> 34:19.201
I [bleep] up today,

34:19.235 --> 34:21.370
<i>I just got us
kicked out of service,</i>

34:21.404 --> 34:22.905
so I'm just trying
to be a realist.

34:22.938 --> 34:26.641
I'm feeling like
a [bleep] piece of [bleep].

34:26.676 --> 34:28.510
I [bleep] up tonight.

34:28.545 --> 34:30.078
Who was the supporter?
Who was the driver?

34:30.112 --> 34:31.847
She was the supporter,
I was the driver.

34:31.880 --> 34:33.181
So, what the [bleep]!

34:33.216 --> 34:34.650
You let her fail!

34:34.684 --> 34:36.452
I refuse to be the fall guy
for this.

34:36.485 --> 34:39.021
I'm tired of [bleep]
picking up people's [bleep].

34:39.054 --> 34:40.389
You gotta stop
screaming, please.

34:40.422 --> 34:41.456
<i>I'm not screaming.
Yes, you are screaming.</i>

34:41.491 --> 34:43.492
Listen, you the driver.

34:43.525 --> 34:44.560
You the driver.
What I'm trying to...

34:44.594 --> 34:46.027
Hold on, hold on!
No!

34:46.062 --> 34:48.163
I'm trying to get my...
I don't [bleep] care!

34:48.197 --> 34:50.165
Because you're [bleep]
going on and on and on,

34:50.199 --> 34:53.068

34:53.101 --> 34:54.335
We need to fix the mistake!

Seriously, Nedra,
just shut the [bleep] up,

34:57.207 --> 34:58.841
because you know what, bitch?

34:58.875 --> 35:00.676

You're still the [bleep] reason
why we got [bleep] kicked out!

35:08.785 --> 35:10.819
And I admitted that!
I admitted it!

Amanda face off in the dorms,

downstairs
in the blue kitchen...

35:22.131 --> 35:24.032
I don't want to
[bleep] overcook 'em.

35:24.067 --> 35:26.602
(Announcer) Michael and Ray hope
their re-fired steak is ready.

35:26.636 --> 35:27.836
Here.
Let 'em rest on the rack?

35:27.871 --> 35:29.371
All right, buddy, number two.

35:29.405 --> 35:30.939
We gotta get this right.

35:30.974 --> 35:34.910
Michael, are you sure you're
confident with those? Check 'em.

35:34.944 --> 35:36.845
All right, I'm going
on the strip. Here.

35:36.880 --> 35:38.814

These steaks need to be perfect.

35:40.350 --> 35:42.217
If they're not, we're done.

Perfect.

Finally, a decent service.

<i>You won, but I don't want you

This wasn't a perfect service,

36:30.333 --> 36:31.867

36:31.901 --> 36:34.002
Now we don't have to send
someone home.

36:34.037 --> 36:37.472
First of all, it's no
big surprise, but you lost.

36:37.507 --> 36:39.641
I was afraid of all the success
going to your heads.

36:39.676 --> 36:41.910
Well, it came crashing down
tonight.

36:41.945 --> 36:44.146

36:44.180 --> 36:47.516

the weakest individuals,

36:49.018 --> 36:51.520
Yes, chef.
Yes, chef.

36:51.554 --> 36:53.055
Who the hell do we put up?

36:53.089 --> 36:54.456
It's the obvious choice.

36:54.490 --> 36:56.558
The two people
who [bleep] tonight.

36:56.593 --> 36:58.093
The two people who got us
kicked out of the kitchen.

36:58.127 --> 36:59.528
They going up tonight.
[Bleep] them.

36:59.562 --> 37:01.897
So, wh... why did y'all
get kicked out?

37:01.931 --> 37:05.434
We got kicked out because
the filet kept coming up raw.

37:05.468 --> 37:07.002
Definitely putting
Amanda up for elimination.

37:07.036 --> 37:08.403
How are you a chef

37:08.438 --> 37:10.339
and you're not comfortable
doing meat temperatures?

37:10.373 --> 37:13.041
That's a huge,
crucial [bleep] part.

37:13.076 --> 37:16.178
Jacqueline, I feel
like every time

37:16.212 --> 37:18.180
you're driving on any station,

37:18.214 --> 37:20.315
you take the back seat
and you don't drive.

37:20.350 --> 37:24.152
It was the filet. That was
the whole mistake right there.

37:24.187 --> 37:26.021
I can only do so much
as a single person,

37:26.055 --> 37:28.423
and all I asked Amanda to do
is a filet.

37:28.458 --> 37:31.793
I mean, I didn't think that was
a hard, complicated thing.

37:31.828 --> 37:34.696
Jacqueline shouldn't have to
be the one to babysit me,

37:34.731 --> 37:37.499
so don't blame Jacqueline
because she's the driver

37:37.533 --> 37:39.134
<i>that she should have
held the station down.</i>

37:39.168 --> 37:41.236
I'm the one
who [bleep] up the filet.

37:41.270 --> 37:42.471
<i>Stop blaming Jacqueline.</i>

37:42.505 --> 37:44.973
I am not the weakest chef,

37:45.008 --> 37:46.742

tonight's performance alone.

you had some issues too.

Dude, the hair in the burger?

37:58.121 --> 38:00.589
Mary put up a plate tonight
with hair on it.

38:00.623 --> 38:03.859
By my opinion,
really disgusting mistake.

38:03.893 --> 38:05.761
Mary has to share the blame
a little bit.

38:05.795 --> 38:08.096
Whatever.
I re-fired it.

39:51.787 --> 39:52.987
I can temp meat, chef.

39:53.021 --> 39:55.756
You know the steaks were raw,

39:55.791 --> 39:59.360
<i>yet you still sit there.</i>

39:59.394 --> 40:02.930
<i>Amanda, why do you think you
should stay in Hell's Kitchen?</i>

40:02.965 --> 40:04.699
<i>I should stay in Hell's Kitchen</i>

40:04.733 --> 40:06.400
because I'm so passionate
about this, chef.

40:06.435 --> 40:08.169
<i>And up until tonight,</i>

40:08.203 --> 40:11.806
I have been nothing
but an asset to my team.

40:11.840 --> 40:13.541
You disintegrated
like a little mouse.

40:13.575 --> 40:15.243
I promise, if you
give me the chance,

40:15.277 --> 40:18.279
I will speak up, chef.

40:18.313 --> 40:19.914
<i>I failed you tonight
on the meat station, chef,</i>

40:19.948 --> 40:21.582
and I'm very sorry.

40:21.617 --> 40:24.485
I apologize from
the bottom of my heart.

40:24.520 --> 40:26.854
I'm fighting for my life
right now.

40:26.889 --> 40:31.125
I don't know if I can
wait for you any longer.

40:31.160 --> 40:32.894
My decision is...

40:32.928 --> 40:35.897
[Suspenseful music]

40:35.931 --> 40:37.531
♪

40:42.771 --> 40:44.939
Amanda...

40:44.973 --> 40:47.808
Back in line.

40:47.843 --> 40:51.145
Jacqueline,
give me your jacket.

40:51.180 --> 40:52.747
<i>Your time is done
in Hell's Kitchen.</i>

40:52.781 --> 40:55.082
Thank you.
Thank you.

41:00.455 --> 41:03.291
(Jacqueline) I think chef
Ramsay made a huge mistake.

41:03.325 --> 41:06.861
I'm extremely proud of myself
in everything that I do,

41:06.895 --> 41:09.630
and I don't need some guy
that screams at me

41:09.665 --> 41:12.200
to tell me
that I'm a good chef.

41:12.234 --> 41:14.502
I'm gonna keep going on,
and I'm gonna keep cooking,

41:14.536 --> 41:17.471
and it's what I want to do
with my life, and I love it.

41:19.474 --> 41:22.276
Ladies, I hope this

41:22.311 --> 41:25.379
isn't the beginning of a trend.

41:27.416 --> 41:30.484
Leave me alone, guys.
Get out.

41:30.519 --> 41:32.587
(Amanda) I survived by
the skin of my teeth.

41:32.621 --> 41:35.556
I'm definitely gonna
show chef Ramsay

41:35.591 --> 41:37.124
that I am
what he's looking for.

41:37.159 --> 41:41.262
Trust me, tomorrow is gonna be
a whole different story.

41:41.296 --> 41:43.564
(Nedra)
Amanda [bleep] up today.

41:43.599 --> 41:45.366
She need to kick it
in high gear.

41:45.400 --> 41:47.101
I'm gonna be on her ass
like white on rice.

41:47.135 --> 41:49.437
She better be watching out,
home girl.

41:49.471 --> 41:52.807
<i>This journey at Hell's Kitchen
has been like a roller coaster,</i>

41:52.841 --> 41:54.475
but, uh, I'm gonna
make sure everybody

41:54.509 --> 41:56.978
keep their head in the game
so we can keep winning.

41:57.012 --> 41:59.313
(Gordon) Jacqueline
talked a good game,

41:59.348 --> 42:00.648
but unfortunately for her,

42:00.682 --> 42:02.483
I need someone who can deliver.

42:08.023 --> 42:08.990
(Announcer) Next time...

42:09.024 --> 42:11.192
[Cheers and applause]

42:11.226 --> 42:15.963
Will one girl's biggest night
become the chef's...

42:15.998 --> 42:18.532
(Gordon) Taste that! Get in there!
Get in, get in, get in!

42:18.567 --> 42:19.800
(Announcer) Biggest disaster?

42:19.835 --> 42:23.137
This [bleep] rib-eye has
still got his horns on!

42:23.171 --> 42:24.805
What's happening?
[Pounds]

42:24.840 --> 42:26.040
[Bleep]!

42:26.074 --> 42:27.942
(Announcer)
And will one chef do anything...

42:27.976 --> 42:29.644
Oh, God.
[Sighs]

42:29.678 --> 42:31.679
(Announcer) Even if it
means a little sabotage...

42:31.713 --> 42:32.680
Who's searing it?

42:32.714 --> 42:33.881
(Announcer)
To stay in the game?

42:33.915 --> 42:36.450
She took over searing.
Nedra seared it.

42:36.485 --> 42:38.119
Amanda is a [bleep] bitch.

42:38.153 --> 42:40.755
This is an absolute joke!

42:40.789 --> 42:42.056
(Announcer)
Will a young girl's dream...

42:42.090 --> 42:43.691
<i>Uh, chef, I can't
hold them anymore.</i>

42:43.725 --> 42:44.925
(Announcer)
Become her worst nightmare?

42:44.960 --> 42:48.129
This is not possible!
It's extraordinary!

42:48.163 --> 42:49.897
We haven't even served yet!

42:49.931 --> 42:51.932
(Announcer) Find out next
time on a special episode...

42:51.967 --> 42:53.234
<i>(Gordon)
Yes, it was special, all right.</i>

42:53.268 --> 42:54.335
Especially painful.
