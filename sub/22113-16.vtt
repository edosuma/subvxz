Uh, that's where you're
supposed to start.

00:40.190 --> 00:41.489
Oh. Sorry. I was just distracted

00:41.591 --> 00:43.524
by the beautiful word-highlighting.

00:43.627 --> 00:46.094
No, no, no. I could...
I could tell that, sure.

00:46.196 --> 00:48.129
- Yeah.
- Here. I'll rewind it for you.

- CAROL: You just

00:49.722 --> 00:51.432
- give me a signal when to begin.
- Okay.

00:51.534 --> 00:54.268
And also, the highlighting
of the words is the signal

00:54.371 --> 00:55.436
that the machine gives, so...

00:55.538 --> 00:57.171
Hmm.

00:57.273 --> 00:58.406
What? Oh, now? Now?

00:58.508 --> 01:00.141

- Carol, what... what was that?

01:14.624 --> 01:17.258
Oh, I was singing it to
the tune of "Jingle Bells."

01:17.360 --> 01:19.093
Well, could you please sing to the tune

01:19.195 --> 01:20.194

Now, okay, that came out wrong.

Look, I'm sorry. I'm
just worried about him.

01:31.174 --> 01:33.107
He won't come out of his truck.

01:33.209 --> 01:36.357
Well, he just needs some time
to learn to be with people again.

01:36.463 --> 01:38.312
Don't worry. He'll come around.

01:38.415 --> 01:41.170
I hope so. Thanks, Care Bear.

01:48.258 --> 01:49.524
Yeah. You know what?
I'm gonna make a snack.

01:49.626 --> 01:52.126

Hey, Erica.

Just getting a jump on the nursery.

02:14.384 --> 02:16.284
What? You're going with yellow?

02:16.386 --> 02:18.286
Yeah. Yellow triggers heightened levels

02:18.388 --> 02:20.154
of motivation and self-confidence.

02:20.256 --> 02:22.588
It's also great for memory retention.

02:22.748 --> 02:25.293
Did you ever consider... blue?

02:25.395 --> 02:27.361
Well, I... Don't you think
that's leaning pretty heavily

02:27.464 --> 02:29.130
in one gender direction?

02:29.232 --> 02:30.264
Don't you think yellow's

02:30.366 --> 02:32.200
leaning pretty heavily
in the urine direction?

02:32.302 --> 02:34.435
Geez, excuse me. I was just
trying to help, you know.

02:34.537 --> 02:36.204
No, I mean, don't get defensive. I...

02:36.306 --> 02:38.139
Well, you just attacked
the color I chose.

02:38.241 --> 02:39.474
You know, I went into survival mode.

02:39.576 --> 02:43.411
Relax. I'm just saying if we're
going to co-parent together,

02:43.564 --> 02:45.213
maybe don't leave me
out of these decisions.

02:45.315 --> 02:47.448
Fine. Okay. What color would you like?

02:47.550 --> 02:50.518
- I like blue.
- I like yellow.

(SIGHS)

02:52.422 --> 02:54.288
Okay, well, obvious solution here.

- You like yellow, I like blue.
- Right.

02:56.253 --> 02:57.894
So let's just go with green.

02:58.014 --> 03:00.294
Green?

03:01.068 --> 03:02.330
Green it is.

03:02.432 --> 03:04.432
- Great.
- Green.

It's called "fake-a-mole."

03:21.692 --> 03:24.786
We're out of avocados, so I
just whipped up some oatmeal,

03:24.872 --> 03:26.612
added brown rice for mouth-feel,

03:26.637 --> 03:29.200
then blended in some green
food coloring, you know,

03:29.225 --> 03:30.525
for visual titillation.

03:30.870 --> 03:32.326
And the uncooked pasta?

03:32.428 --> 03:34.228
Hmm. "Fake-atilla chips."

I'm gonna fake-a eat this.

I'm doing the best I can.

03:44.507 --> 03:46.507
We are pretty much out of everything.

03:46.609 --> 03:48.476
Who's supposed to go
on the next supply run?

03:48.578 --> 03:51.751
Well, according to the chore
wheel, it's Gail and Melissa,

03:51.778 --> 03:54.081
and they were supposed
to do it yesterday.

03:54.106 --> 03:54.978
Well, don't look at me.

had</i> a chore wheel.

- Catch us on the next spin, I guess.
- CAROL: No.

- Come on, guys.
- Yeah. This is ridiculous.

at the table.

04:13.324 --> 04:17.293
And if you have to, use
the scientific term: gonads.

04:17.317 --> 04:18.432
Oh, no, no, no, Carol.

04:18.457 --> 04:20.374
He's talking about my
thermal imaging machine,

04:20.476 --> 04:22.210
which I use to locate heat signatures.

04:22.312 --> 04:24.832
TANDY: Uh, let me explain.
It's like the Predator.

04:24.857 --> 04:27.197
You know, like how
the... He sees the world?

04:27.243 --> 04:29.150
The Predator sees the world? You know?

04:29.252 --> 04:32.119
Like if a-a tiger jumps
out of a jungle bush.

04:32.222 --> 04:34.055
Uh, Predator doesn't see a tiger.

04:34.157 --> 04:36.257
He sees more, like, a
bunch of colors, you know?

04:36.359 --> 04:39.093
You know, but he-he
still knows it's a tiger.

04:39.195 --> 04:40.228
You guys seen <i> Predator?</i>

04:40.330 --> 04:41.295
ALL: No.

04:41.397 --> 04:43.197
Okay, Mike, you better explain this.

04:43.299 --> 04:45.399
Uh, yeah. It's like a
metal detector for heat.

04:45.501 --> 04:47.468
- ALL: Oh!
- I was gonna do that one next.

04:47.570 --> 04:48.865
- TODD: Oh, that's cool.
- Yeah.

04:48.968 --> 04:50.500
Y-You find anything on there, or...?

04:50.525 --> 04:52.217
Yeah. Just last night, I saw something

04:52.242 --> 04:54.375
unlike anything I'd ever
seen on there before.

04:54.477 --> 04:55.543
What is it?

04:55.645 --> 04:57.703
Well, I-I'm not really sure.

04:57.756 --> 05:00.448
You know, uh, your
typical volcano is what...

05:00.550 --> 05:02.183
I don't know... 1,600
degrees Fahrenheit?

05:02.285 --> 05:04.118
(SPEAKING GIBBERISH) Yup.

05:04.220 --> 05:05.121
Yeah, right?

05:05.146 --> 05:07.601
Uh, and this thing's
clocking in at 100 degrees,

05:07.727 --> 05:13.041
which is noteworthy because the
human body temperature is 98.6.

05:13.081 --> 05:13.656
(CAROL GASPS)

05:13.681 --> 05:14.953
- TODD: Oh.
- ERICA: Wait.

05:14.978 --> 05:16.364
Are you saying it's people?

05:16.466 --> 05:18.187
No. I mean, it could be a
million things, you know.

05:18.212 --> 05:21.235
It could be a, what, a
geyser, or, uh, you know,

05:21.337 --> 05:23.037
just some trapped methane, you know.

05:23.139 --> 05:24.472
A bunch of geese, maybe.

05:24.574 --> 05:26.374
Guess I'll, uh, find out tomorrow.

05:27.605 --> 05:30.211
Tomorrow? What...?
What-what do you mean?

05:30.779 --> 05:33.365
Oh. I'm leaving.

05:42.467 --> 05:44.434
What's up?

05:44.469 --> 05:46.469
You just got here, Mike,

05:46.510 --> 05:48.371
and you're already leaving?

05:48.396 --> 05:51.204
No, it's 800 miles away. I'll
be back before you know it.

05:51.229 --> 05:54.364
Uh, gas is unreliable,
we're in a foreign country.

05:54.479 --> 05:55.845
No AAA.

05:55.870 --> 05:57.803
You know as well as I do

05:57.899 --> 06:01.201
that 800 miles in this
world isn't really 800 miles.

06:01.767 --> 06:03.767
I got to go see this thing, man.

06:03.792 --> 06:05.004
I got to check it out.

06:05.763 --> 06:07.325
I mean, sure, it's probably nothing,

06:07.350 --> 06:08.942
but, I mean, what if it isn't, okay?

06:08.977 --> 06:13.467
Come on, man. It's too
dangerous, especially alone.

06:13.492 --> 06:14.625
Come with me then.

06:14.650 --> 06:15.882
I can't leave Carol right now.

06:15.917 --> 06:18.768
I mean, she's super
pregnant, and the twins.

06:19.295 --> 06:22.128
Look, I'm begging you.

06:25.721 --> 06:26.837
Okay, fine.

06:27.694 --> 06:28.839
I won't go.

06:29.323 --> 06:30.755
(SIGHS)

06:30.780 --> 06:33.115
CAROL: So this map shows all the markets

06:33.140 --> 06:35.001
in a 50-mile radius.

06:35.036 --> 06:36.836
What do the smiley faces mean?

06:36.872 --> 06:39.553
Well, smiley faces look
sort of sinister to me,

06:39.578 --> 06:43.327
so they represent all the stores
that don't have any more food.

06:43.352 --> 06:45.827
So, the rainbows represent
the stores we should go to?

06:45.852 --> 06:48.565
No, those are just rainbows. (LAUGHS)

06:48.645 --> 06:50.016
Just tell us where we should go.

06:50.051 --> 06:53.570
Well, your best bet is probably

06:53.816 --> 06:57.556
this area... over here.

06:57.603 --> 06:59.644
- Hmm.
- CAROL: Okay? You gals

06:59.669 --> 07:01.302
think you can handle this?

07:01.338 --> 07:03.471
Carol, you can count on us.

07:06.184 --> 07:08.376
How long you think we need to be gone?

07:08.411 --> 07:09.711
Five hours. Pull.

07:13.308 --> 07:15.108
Think that we should
go to at least one store

07:15.143 --> 07:18.221
so we can honestly say we
tried to look for supplies?

07:18.246 --> 07:19.579
No. Pull.

07:32.497 --> 07:33.629
Going somewhere?

07:34.309 --> 07:35.716
What the hell are you doing?

07:35.741 --> 07:38.264
Keeping you honest, you
friggin' donkey dong.

07:38.300 --> 07:39.399
What if I didn't see you?

07:39.434 --> 07:41.267
I would've killed
you, you friggin' turd.

07:41.303 --> 07:43.069
You already did kill me, Mike.

07:43.376 --> 07:44.541
In my heart.

07:44.566 --> 07:46.072
You lied to me.

07:46.108 --> 07:48.041
You said you were gonna
stay, and you lied!

07:48.076 --> 07:50.143
Oh, come on. What is the big deal?

07:50.178 --> 07:52.245
I'm gonna be gone for, like, three days.

07:52.280 --> 07:54.047
I'm saving your life, Mike.

07:54.082 --> 07:56.008
Traveling this distance alone,

07:56.061 --> 07:58.351
one little mistake, and you're dead.

07:58.387 --> 08:00.987
I orbited the friggin' Earth, Phil!

08:01.022 --> 08:02.727
I'm pretty sure I can handle a truck

08:02.752 --> 08:04.290
on a bunch of paved roads.

08:04.326 --> 08:06.747
Fine! Go. But you're gonna have to drive

08:06.772 --> 08:08.658
over my face and head in the process.

08:08.683 --> 08:10.397
You know what? That'll
probably improve your looks.

08:10.432 --> 08:12.232
Oh! Is that a joke about how ugly I am?

08:12.267 --> 08:14.067
No, it's a very serious statement

08:14.102 --> 08:16.653
- about how ugly you are.
- How dare you.

08:16.678 --> 08:17.959
All right, see you later.
I'm gonna pop your head

08:17.984 --> 08:19.633
- and hit the road.
- Oh, good!

08:19.658 --> 08:21.040
Have fun killing me!

08:21.076 --> 08:23.009
Have fun getting killed by me!

08:23.044 --> 08:25.044
Hey, tell Carol I want an open casket

08:25.080 --> 08:28.806
so everyone can see what
you did to your own brother!

08:28.831 --> 08:30.150
An open casket will make it a lot easier

08:30.185 --> 08:31.985
to take a dump on your dead chest!

08:32.020 --> 08:33.419
Oh, you're a monster!

08:33.455 --> 08:35.989
I can't wait to teach
your babies how to smoke!

08:36.024 --> 08:38.917
Oh, you did not just say
that right before my death!

08:38.942 --> 08:40.058
Relax, your head's

08:40.095 --> 08:41.428
probably fat enough that you'll survive.

08:41.462 --> 08:44.063
- So, you gonna do this or what?
- Yeah, I'm gonna do it!

08:44.099 --> 08:45.715
- You don't have the guts!
- Oh, yeah?

08:45.747 --> 08:47.421
Watch me!

08:47.467 --> 08:48.449
Do it!

08:48.474 --> 08:49.469
- I'm gonna do it!

08:52.682 --> 08:54.249
Crush my face!

08:54.274 --> 08:56.142
- End me!
- I am gonna do it!

08:56.178 --> 08:58.977
Take my head and feed
it to the driveway!

08:59.002 --> 09:01.080
I'm gonna squash your head like a zit!

09:01.116 --> 09:03.416
- Carol, good-bye! I love you!
- I'm gonna do it!

09:03.452 --> 09:06.186
- I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna do it!
- Do it!

09:06.221 --> 09:08.221
- Do it!
- Get ready! You're gonna die!

09:08.256 --> 09:11.057
- I'm gonna do it!
- (SCREAMING)

09:11.092 --> 09:12.581
(SCREAMING)

09:22.159 --> 09:24.170
Ah. Oh, thank God.

09:24.468 --> 09:26.234
You made the right call.

09:26.486 --> 09:27.971
See you in the morning, bud.

09:27.996 --> 09:29.729
MIKE: Go to hell.

09:35.742 --> 09:37.709
MIKE: Morning, Phil.

09:41.372 --> 09:43.306
Whatcha doing?

09:44.375 --> 09:46.715
Cleaning out the fireplace.

09:47.201 --> 09:48.942
By hand?

09:49.734 --> 09:51.701
It's why it's so clean.

10:03.603 --> 10:07.371
Hmm. May I see your index finger?

10:07.407 --> 10:09.373
(SCOFFS)

10:17.057 --> 10:19.417
Phil, I'm... curious.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.586
Do you have any idea where my keys are?

10:21.621 --> 10:24.589
Do I have any idea where your keys are?

10:30.920 --> 10:34.565
Look, things got a little
heated last night, but, uh...

10:34.601 --> 10:37.501
well, after thinking about
it, I realize you were right.

10:37.537 --> 10:39.704
(LAUGHS FORCEDLY)

10:40.373 --> 10:42.151
Nice try.

10:42.176 --> 10:44.196
No, I'm not trying to do anything here.

10:44.221 --> 10:46.721
Oh, so I guess you're just
kissing my buns all up and down

10:46.746 --> 10:48.746
for gits and shiggles.

10:48.781 --> 10:51.482
No, I just want to thank you
for talking some sense into me.

10:51.517 --> 10:53.417
So you think if you're nice enough,

10:53.453 --> 10:55.586
you might just get your keys back.

10:55.622 --> 10:56.821
So you <i> do</i> know where my keys are.

10:58.891 --> 11:00.130
Okay, whatever.

11:00.155 --> 11:02.255
Not going anywhere anyway, so...

11:02.810 --> 11:04.629
You want to go outside, dick around?

11:05.017 --> 11:08.532
Do I want to go dick around?

11:09.604 --> 11:11.335
No.

11:16.830 --> 11:18.442
Suit yourself.

11:22.210 --> 11:23.814
Friggin' idiot.

11:24.830 --> 11:27.055
(CHUCKLES) Erica, do you like

11:27.080 --> 11:28.335
- this onesie?
- No.

11:29.835 --> 11:32.800
Okay, y'all. Very, very funny.

11:32.825 --> 11:34.558
You got your ya-ya's out.

11:34.594 --> 11:35.626
Now spill the beans.

11:35.662 --> 11:36.942
- Who did it?
- Who did what?

11:36.967 --> 11:38.251
Who went and took all the supplies

11:38.276 --> 11:39.304
we worked so hard to get?

11:39.329 --> 11:42.644
I mean, we literally worked all day

11:42.669 --> 11:44.345
- to get those supplies.
- Yeah.

11:44.370 --> 11:47.338
We put 'em in the pantry
while y'all were asleep,

11:47.363 --> 11:49.019
and now they're gone.

11:49.044 --> 11:51.011
Hell of a thank-you for
all of our tireless work.

11:51.036 --> 11:53.146
So much toil.

11:53.171 --> 11:55.338
You should see all the
calluses we have on our hands.

11:55.373 --> 11:58.107
- Check this out, Gail.
- Oh, God. Oh, my God.

11:58.143 --> 12:00.076
I've never seen so many calluses,

12:00.111 --> 12:02.587
and I have just as many, if not more.

12:02.612 --> 12:05.613
Ugh! Ah, it's like looking
at the surface of the moon.

12:06.822 --> 12:11.087
So, how many stores did you go to?

12:13.158 --> 12:15.706
- 78.
- 103.

12:15.840 --> 12:18.027
So you're sticking with this story?

12:18.063 --> 12:20.363
Because it's literally
what happened, Erica.

12:20.398 --> 12:22.746
<i>Lit-er-ally.</i>

12:22.771 --> 12:24.367
Well...

12:24.989 --> 12:26.889
Todd, are you okay?

12:28.078 --> 12:29.686
(CRYING): I just feel

12:29.711 --> 12:32.141
like I'm being lied to. You know?

12:33.428 --> 12:36.601
And it's really hurting my heart

12:37.021 --> 12:40.321
because we're all in
this together, guys.

12:41.121 --> 12:43.199
I mean, do you see this woman?

12:43.224 --> 12:46.058
She's bringing a life into this world.

12:47.046 --> 12:48.714
And she needed those supplies

12:48.739 --> 12:50.672
for herself and her baby.

12:52.599 --> 12:54.924
Now, you sure you're
telling me the truth?

12:56.317 --> 12:59.936
We went to zero stores.

13:00.184 --> 13:02.105
I just shot my guns.

13:02.544 --> 13:05.074
And I drank a tankload of wine.

13:05.435 --> 13:07.657
Now go on and get those supplies.

13:07.682 --> 13:09.345
(CONTINUES CRYING)

13:09.655 --> 13:11.114
(STAMMERS) On our way.

13:11.149 --> 13:12.382
We're so sorry.

13:12.417 --> 13:14.384
(STOPS CRYING)

13:15.155 --> 13:17.086
Well, I think that worked pretty well.

13:19.997 --> 13:21.574
Huh.

13:35.679 --> 13:37.974
You left the seven.

13:38.249 --> 13:40.216
And half the three.

13:40.484 --> 13:42.751
MIKE: Want to help me pick up the spare?

13:50.548 --> 13:52.121
You got this!

13:52.157 --> 13:53.635
- You got this, bud!
- Here I come.

13:54.921 --> 13:56.595
- What? No! Hey!
- Gutter ball.

13:56.634 --> 13:58.467
No, not cool.

14:01.371 --> 14:02.537
Here I come!

14:04.420 --> 14:08.004
- Ah, you missed me. Missed me.
- No, no! Come on!

14:08.232 --> 14:09.498
You moved!

14:09.813 --> 14:10.973
You turd... ow!

14:11.009 --> 14:12.942
Sir, I saw your last roll.

14:12.977 --> 14:15.399
- I just want to commend you.
- Thank you very much.

14:15.424 --> 14:16.379
- Absolutely. No...
- I appreciate it.

14:16.414 --> 14:17.380
(SCREAMING)

14:17.415 --> 14:19.048
(BOTH SCREAMING)

14:19.083 --> 14:20.852
All right, buddy, let's
go. It's your turn.

14:20.877 --> 14:22.852
Will you please give me a moment?

14:22.877 --> 14:25.321
I am having a three-way, sir.

14:25.356 --> 14:26.355
(YELLING)

14:26.391 --> 14:27.290
(YELPS)

14:28.190 --> 14:29.158

14:29.623 --> 14:32.061
- Uh-oh. No.

14:49.634 --> 14:50.362

14:51.721 --> 14:53.049
- that was fun out there.
- Yeah.

14:53.084 --> 14:55.318
Yeah. Um...

14:55.953 --> 14:58.637
Whoa, you, uh... you got
something on your nose.

14:58.662 --> 14:59.492
You got a little...

14:59.517 --> 15:00.957
- Oh, really?
- Yeah. Right there on the end.

15:00.992 --> 15:02.024
I get it?

15:02.060 --> 15:04.401
- Yeah, now you got it.
- Okay. All right.

15:04.426 --> 15:06.929
- Have a good night.
- Night. Hey, Mike.

15:07.271 --> 15:08.370
Hmm?

15:08.585 --> 15:10.552
Want to see something cool?

15:13.051 --> 15:15.084
I still can't believe I did this.

15:19.978 --> 15:22.144
Well, I should get to bed.

15:22.180 --> 15:23.679
Okay. Night, bud.

15:43.055 --> 15:45.134
So, you're still gonna go.

15:45.463 --> 15:46.696
(SNIFFS)

15:46.721 --> 15:48.337
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

15:48.373 --> 15:50.006
What is it with you, Mike?

15:50.041 --> 15:52.341
I mean, every time
you show up in my life,

15:52.377 --> 15:55.111
- you can't wait to leave.
- Oh, that is not true.

15:55.146 --> 15:56.345
Oh, come on, admit it.

15:56.381 --> 15:59.941
- You don't like me, and you never have.
- Okay, fine!

15:59.966 --> 16:01.984
Phil, you want the truth?

16:02.020 --> 16:04.271
Oh, no, no! What gave you that idea?!

16:04.837 --> 16:07.089
It is hard for me to be around you.

16:07.125 --> 16:10.737
Was that so hard to say? Huh?
'Cause I knew it all along!

16:11.197 --> 16:12.962
I have never been good enough.

16:13.364 --> 16:14.463
For you.

16:14.488 --> 16:15.829
For Mom and Dad.

16:15.854 --> 16:18.968
You know, not smart enough,
not successful enough.

16:19.003 --> 16:22.916
And even now that there are only
13 people left on this planet,

16:22.941 --> 16:25.861
you would rather leave...
than to have to watch

16:25.886 --> 16:27.243
the embarrassment that is your brother.

16:27.278 --> 16:29.178
No. No, it's not any of that at all.

16:29.213 --> 16:30.676
Oh, then what the hell is it?

16:30.701 --> 16:32.601
I'm jealous of you, Phil!

16:34.252 --> 16:35.985
I'm jealous.

16:36.020 --> 16:38.387
I want what <i> you</i> have.

16:38.874 --> 16:40.336
You've got a wife, you know?

16:40.361 --> 16:41.763
And kids. You have a family.

16:41.788 --> 16:43.668
You have a real family.

16:44.721 --> 16:47.096
It's all I've ever wanted.

16:47.819 --> 16:48.714
What have I got?

16:48.739 --> 16:51.532
I-I've got a blob on a computer screen.

16:52.425 --> 16:54.932
It's not people. I know
that, you know that.

16:55.379 --> 16:57.373
Of course it's not people.

16:58.698 --> 17:01.179
But, damn, man, I got to find
that out for myself, okay?

17:01.204 --> 17:04.071
Do you understand that? I have
to go check it out, for me.

17:06.017 --> 17:08.190
I'm leaving in the morning, all right?

17:09.729 --> 17:11.244
And if you love me...

17:11.509 --> 17:13.328
just let me go.

17:27.797 --> 17:28.862
Now what?

17:28.965 --> 17:30.965
Just wanted to wish you a safe trip.

17:31.067 --> 17:32.900
Thank you.

17:33.108 --> 17:35.241
I have something for you.

17:44.013 --> 17:45.946
I'm coming with you.

17:46.285 --> 17:47.338
But-but what...

17:47.363 --> 17:49.016
what about Carol and the kids?

17:49.118 --> 17:50.918

Oh, Tandy.

TODD: Hey.

19:21.877 --> 19:23.610
What are you doing?

19:24.123 --> 19:25.812
I suddenly realized

19:25.915 --> 19:28.615
this room would look
really great in yellow.

19:29.504 --> 19:31.885
Someone told me it helps with memory.

19:31.987 --> 19:34.488
- I can't remember who.
- Well, don't get me wrong,

19:34.590 --> 19:37.624
I really like yellow, but, uh...

19:37.726 --> 19:39.760
I had...

19:40.328 --> 19:42.194
a little epiphany.

19:42.765 --> 19:45.260
Um, walls in yellow, trim in blue?

19:45.285 --> 19:46.183
Works for me.

19:53.642 --> 19:55.542
Sorry, had to grab some
snacks for the road.

19:55.644 --> 19:57.544
- That's all right.
- Uh, I've got a lemonade here

19:57.646 --> 19:59.646
with your name on it if you get thirsty.

20:00.475 --> 20:03.550
When did they start putting
lemonade in fruit punch bottles?

20:03.652 --> 20:06.853
(CHUCKLES) Trust me,
it's, uh, lemonade. Yeah.

20:08.799 --> 20:10.420
Nah, I'm good for now.

20:10.445 --> 20:11.692
All right.

20:11.794 --> 20:14.928
Well, then I'll just
enjoy it for right now.

20:16.571 --> 20:17.643
Mmm. It's good.

20:17.733 --> 20:19.600
- You sure? It's very good.
- Good. Yeah, no.
