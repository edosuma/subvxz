WEBVTT

00:18.268 --> 00:19.978
[Poison Ivy]
Can you leave Tuesday, or...

00:20.103 --> 00:21.479
Sorry, that's leg day.

00:21.563 --> 00:23.398
You know, the Bat family
is all about group squats.

00:23.481 --> 00:24.983
Oh. What about next Thursday?

00:25.066 --> 00:27.652
Ugh. Thursdays are my day
for surveillance at the docks.

00:27.777 --> 00:29.779
Okay. Well, then, honey,
when can you go?

00:29.863 --> 00:31.656
Heroes deserve a day off.

00:31.740 --> 00:33.575
Even all those
unvaccinated firefighters.

00:33.658 --> 00:35.326
You know what? Yeah.
Yeah, let's just go
this weekend.

00:35.452 --> 00:38.830
Actually, the Lexor in Vegas
just reopened,

00:38.955 --> 00:40.373
and it's free for villains.

00:40.498 --> 00:42.584
Oh, yeah! Cheetah and Kanye
renewed their vows there.

00:42.667 --> 00:46.379
Wait, isn't
Clayface's residency
starting this weekend?

00:46.504 --> 00:48.590
I've been getting so many
targeted ads, it's like, ugh.

00:48.673 --> 00:50.967
Same! Oh, my God,
I cannot believe we
haven't talked about this.

00:51.051 --> 00:54.054
He's singing the greatest hits
of other Vegas residencies?

00:54.179 --> 00:56.306
Yes, and why is
the trailer in French?

00:56.389 --> 00:59.100
Why is he taking a bubble bath
in army fatigues?

00:59.184 --> 01:00.810
Yeah, like,
who is the audience?

01:00.894 --> 01:02.771
Anyone who couldn't get tickets
to literally anything else.

01:02.854 --> 01:05.397
[both laugh]

01:05.522 --> 01:06.858
Totally. But actually, honey,

01:06.983 --> 01:08.777
you know, now that
you're with the Bat family,

01:08.860 --> 01:11.488
you probably shouldn't stay
at the evilest resort in Vegas.

01:11.571 --> 01:13.448
No, no, no. No, I miss you.

01:13.531 --> 01:14.741
I miss staying up all night,

01:14.866 --> 01:16.368
you know,
getting into erotic mischief,

01:16.451 --> 01:17.702
feeding each other
baby carrots.

01:17.827 --> 01:20.705
-Yeah, girl!
-Let's go to Vegas!

01:21.456 --> 01:23.625
[theme music playing]

01:29.214 --> 01:30.590
-[dinging]
-[coins jingling]

01:31.883 --> 01:33.718
[people groaning]

01:33.843 --> 01:35.887
Okay, dial extension three
if you need goons...

01:35.970 --> 01:37.889
-[Harley] Ooh!
-Four for guns, knives, tanks,

01:37.972 --> 01:40.140
and five for fresh towels.

01:40.225 --> 01:41.393
[gasps] Oh, the grenades
are chocolate,

01:41.476 --> 01:43.186
but the chocolates
are grenades.

01:43.269 --> 01:44.604
Gonna save this for later.
[chuckles]

01:44.729 --> 01:47.190
Would you like me
to have your suite pre-tarped

01:47.273 --> 01:50.235
before you deal with
your hostage? Er, victim?

01:50.318 --> 01:51.569
Hey, you suck at whispering.

01:51.652 --> 01:53.154
-I am her girlfriend.
-[woman] Hmm.

01:53.238 --> 01:55.824
Let me know
if you need anything at all.

01:55.907 --> 01:57.450
Oh! Actually, uh, we do.

01:57.575 --> 01:59.828
We'd love a pair of tickets
to the Clayface show.

01:59.911 --> 02:02.163
We should probably
just check it out
while we're here, right?

02:02.247 --> 02:04.249
[laughs] That show's been
sold out for months.

02:04.332 --> 02:05.750
[both laughing]

02:05.834 --> 02:08.086
Oh, wait.
Are you serious? For real?

02:08.169 --> 02:09.169
-But good news...
-[Starros chittering]

02:09.253 --> 02:11.589
Mr. Face generously invited you

02:11.715 --> 02:14.300
to his pre-show
pool party this afternoon.

02:14.426 --> 02:15.677
Ah, very subtle.

02:15.760 --> 02:17.595
I'm just gonna have
Nora handle the tickets.

02:17.679 --> 02:19.764
Complimentary
Blood-of-Your-Enemies shooter?

02:19.889 --> 02:22.434
Yours has some of your
fourth grade math teacher's.

02:22.559 --> 02:25.020
Oh. To the best weekend ever.

02:25.103 --> 02:25.937
[both] Whoo!

02:26.062 --> 02:27.313
Ow!

02:27.439 --> 02:29.524
So what should we do first?
[gasps] Ooh!

02:29.607 --> 02:31.401
-We should see that show Fall.
-[phone vibrating]

02:31.484 --> 02:34.863
The aerial circus show
with the spikes
instead of safety nets?

02:34.946 --> 02:38.324
Uh, you know what would be
so unexpected and subversive?

02:38.450 --> 02:40.368
Going to see
the glass-blown ceiling garden

02:40.452 --> 02:42.871
designed by famous
blind artist Dale Chihuly.

02:42.954 --> 02:44.414
And on the way back,

02:44.497 --> 02:46.416
we stop at the M&M's store,
scoop a couple L.B.'s?

02:46.499 --> 02:49.293
I know a candy-coated chocolate
makes you horny.

02:49.377 --> 02:51.963
-Oh!
-[both moaning]

02:52.047 --> 02:53.423
Should I call for tarp?

02:54.132 --> 02:56.301
[fireworks]

03:04.392 --> 03:05.685
[grunting]

03:09.939 --> 03:12.484
I want that one
with the fat ass! [laughs]

03:12.609 --> 03:15.779
-[elevator dings]
-Ugh. So sorry we had to wait
in line for three hours.

03:15.862 --> 03:19.115
Hey, at least
we got to see that M&M's
through the years display.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.909
Pretty fun to see
the tan ones, huh?

03:20.992 --> 03:22.619
Yeah, no, totally.

03:22.702 --> 03:25.997
I also loved hearing
so many babies
screaming in line.

03:26.122 --> 03:30.001
Ah, free guns! What?
And with airbrushing? Oh!

03:32.003 --> 03:33.380
-[phone buzzes]
-[groans]

03:33.505 --> 03:35.340
Do... Do you wanna
deal with that, or...

03:35.423 --> 03:37.841
No. Work can wait.
I don't wanna interrupt
these sexy party vibes!

03:37.926 --> 03:40.053
Ma'am, is this hero
bothering you?

03:40.178 --> 03:41.721
Oh, shit, King!

03:41.846 --> 03:43.055
Green Goddess!

03:43.180 --> 03:46.643
Tabitha, you remember my boss
and my former boss.

03:46.726 --> 03:48.853
I told you,
this is my babymoon.

03:48.978 --> 03:50.730
I wanna fuck a magician.

03:50.855 --> 03:52.273
Uh, yes, ma'am.

03:52.357 --> 03:55.235
Tabitha and our
nine unborn children
are here to party.

03:55.360 --> 04:00.031
And I'm here to support them
in whatever way is least
annoying to her.

04:00.115 --> 04:01.658
Ugh! Cover your gills.

04:01.741 --> 04:03.743
I can feel you breathing
on my hammer.

04:03.868 --> 04:06.037
Uh, Miss Ivy, Elvis has
requested you join him

04:06.121 --> 04:08.707
for some white rhino
bone marrow in his cabana.

04:08.790 --> 04:10.083
Oh, okay.

04:10.208 --> 04:11.710
I mean, it is Elvis.

04:11.793 --> 04:13.420
[chuckling] Well, of course.

04:16.047 --> 04:19.634
Harley, I'm worried Tabitha
won't let me co-parent
with her.

04:19.718 --> 04:21.803
And I want to be part
of these sharks' lives.

04:21.886 --> 04:24.681
Yeah, that's a tough one.
She seems to hate you.

04:24.764 --> 04:27.642
Yo, hook me up with
a couple of those green ones.

04:30.478 --> 04:32.731
Chocolate?
I thought they were benzos!

04:32.814 --> 04:35.734
[gags] I need to get this taste
out of my mouth.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.112
[groans]

04:39.237 --> 04:40.363
Uh, I'm sorry.

04:40.447 --> 04:41.740
Should you be
smoking cigarettes

04:41.823 --> 04:43.116
since you're, like,
extremely pregnant?

04:43.241 --> 04:45.409
Don't humansplain
my body to me.

04:45.493 --> 04:47.078
Yeah, you heard her!

04:47.162 --> 04:50.206
Would it kill you to look up
"shark placenta"?

04:50.290 --> 04:51.791
Mmm-hmm.

04:52.792 --> 04:54.336
Now scram!

04:54.419 --> 04:56.755
Should... Should I check
on our fruit medley?

04:56.838 --> 04:59.466
You know that famous gumbo
from my kingdom?

04:59.591 --> 05:02.093
Of course!
Hakarl gumbo! [chuckles]

05:02.177 --> 05:05.555
I mean, there's a beloved
folk song about how hard
it is to make.

05:05.638 --> 05:07.891
Yeah, I want that.

05:07.974 --> 05:09.100
[sighs wearily]

05:09.225 --> 05:12.562
My brood's wish is my command.

05:13.646 --> 05:14.814
Hey, how was Elvis?

05:14.939 --> 05:16.608
Wait, no, no.
How was the white rhino?

05:16.691 --> 05:18.526
-No, wait, Elvis first!
-Um, ugh on both, actually.

05:18.610 --> 05:20.570
But you know
who never underwhelms?

05:20.653 --> 05:22.572
Benjamin fuckin' Franklin!

05:22.655 --> 05:24.157
Okay! Who should we bet on?

05:24.282 --> 05:25.283
[shrieks]

05:25.367 --> 05:26.701
[crowd cheering]

05:26.785 --> 05:28.745
I wish I could bet on
this death match.

05:28.828 --> 05:32.290
Bad odds with
Rag Doll's loose stitching,
but I do like his wiry energy.

05:32.415 --> 05:33.375
[crowd cheering]

05:33.457 --> 05:35.126
[grunting]

05:41.841 --> 05:43.051
[grunts]

05:43.134 --> 05:44.886
[screaming]

05:49.307 --> 05:50.767
[cheering]

05:50.850 --> 05:52.977
[exclaims] Wait, no one saw me
cheering for this, right?

05:53.103 --> 05:54.562
[phone buzzing]

05:54.646 --> 05:56.815
Hey, so where are we
with the, uh, Clayface tickets?

05:56.898 --> 05:58.483
I can get
backstage with Celine,

05:58.608 --> 06:01.194
a meet and greet with Britney,
but nada for Clayface.

06:01.319 --> 06:03.071
I mean, can't you just ask him?

06:03.154 --> 06:04.823
Yeah. No, I can't do that.

06:04.948 --> 06:08.076
I may have ignored a few emails
that he may have sent

06:08.159 --> 06:10.161
specifically about
this exact subject,

06:10.245 --> 06:11.204
so just keep trying.

06:11.329 --> 06:12.997
Wow! Even I have tickets.

06:13.123 --> 06:20.088
I guess CEO stands for
"Can't Even do"
capital "O" shit.

06:20.171 --> 06:22.340
Uh, ew. No. Troll.

06:22.465 --> 06:24.342
I already have tickets, man.

06:24.426 --> 06:27.095
I'm just-- I need extra tickets
in case I want seats
for our purses.

06:27.178 --> 06:30.015
Yeah, very cool obvious lies,

06:30.098 --> 06:32.475
so I got to ask,
what's with the narc?

06:32.558 --> 06:35.353
This party is for hotties
and villskies only.

06:35.478 --> 06:39.691
For your FYI,
I'm having a very fun,
very villlski time,

06:39.774 --> 06:41.651
within the limits
of my new occupation.

06:41.735 --> 06:44.988
[scoffs] The Harley I know
would have flicked my taint

06:45.071 --> 06:46.781
for even questioning her.

06:46.865 --> 06:48.241
-[Harley grunts]
-[groans]

06:48.366 --> 06:50.869
Help! [gasps]

06:50.994 --> 06:53.621
-[Harley grunting]
-[coughing]

06:53.705 --> 06:56.707
The Harley I know
would have let me drown.

06:56.832 --> 06:59.586
You know what?
I actually need to run back
to our room for a sec.

06:59.711 --> 07:00.879
Can't let our bounty melt!

07:01.004 --> 07:02.464
Are you sure
you don't want to stay?

07:02.547 --> 07:04.215
We could get, like,
matching pedicures.

07:04.299 --> 07:05.884
Well, I guess I could.

07:07.010 --> 07:08.470
[chitters]

07:10.055 --> 07:10.930
[glass breaks]

07:11.056 --> 07:12.557
[gasps]

07:13.433 --> 07:15.060
Um, you stay. I'm fine.

07:15.143 --> 07:17.937
You deserve to be pampered by
these evil cuties. [chuckles]

07:18.063 --> 07:19.397
Okay, cool.

07:19.522 --> 07:20.815
[roars]

07:20.899 --> 07:22.108
Yes!

07:22.233 --> 07:24.569
-Make that pool noodle cry.
-[man whimpers, screams]

07:24.652 --> 07:26.196
-Whoo!
-[crowd cheering]

07:26.279 --> 07:27.155
[helicopter whirring]

07:27.238 --> 07:29.949
[rhythmic music playing]

07:37.999 --> 07:39.959
[people exclaiming, clamoring]

07:40.043 --> 07:42.045
Oh, kisses at you!

07:42.128 --> 07:42.962
Kiss, kiss.

07:43.755 --> 07:45.507
Oh, for dick's sake.

07:45.590 --> 07:48.093
-[clamoring]
-You look gorgeous!

07:48.176 --> 07:49.427
Ugh.

07:49.552 --> 07:55.100
Well, well, if it isn't my old
so-and-so, Poison Ivy.

07:55.225 --> 07:56.433
No, good, I'm good.

07:56.518 --> 07:58.186
-Don't need any...
-Whoo!

07:58.269 --> 08:00.313
I fucking love you, Clayface!

08:00.438 --> 08:02.816
Ha! I love you too, sweetie!

08:02.941 --> 08:05.235
See you at tonight's show,
I assume.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.779
Unless, you don't have tickets.

08:07.862 --> 08:10.115
Oh, we're good.
Yeah, we got tickets.

08:10.240 --> 08:13.952
Front row, orchestra seats
six and seven, actually.

08:14.035 --> 08:15.495
Splendid!

08:15.620 --> 08:19.124
I look forward
to seeing you there
in those exact seats.

08:19.249 --> 08:22.293
Ga-Ga, darling!
I got the flowers!

08:22.419 --> 08:27.132
How did you know I was
a gladiola girl? [laughing]

08:27.257 --> 08:29.300
[upbeat music playing]

08:29.384 --> 08:31.469
[crowd cheering]

08:31.594 --> 08:34.972
[announcer] Coming
at you live from the yard
at Blackgate Penitentiary,

08:35.097 --> 08:39.477
let's make some noise
for DJ Daddy'$ Money!

08:39.602 --> 08:43.188
Is that motherfucking
Bruce Wayne?

08:44.107 --> 08:45.608
[grunts]

08:45.692 --> 08:47.485
Bruce is in prison
and still gets to be
a shitty daytime deejay,

08:47.610 --> 08:50.989
but I can't even enjoy Vegas
with my sumptuous life partner?

08:51.114 --> 08:53.408
I'll tell you why
he gets to be a shitty deejay.

08:53.491 --> 08:57.203
Think about it.
Bruce and Batman
are two different people.

08:57.328 --> 08:58.997
[gasps] Of course!

08:59.122 --> 09:01.499
Superheroes all have
secret identities.

09:01.624 --> 09:03.960
All my identities are public!

09:04.044 --> 09:06.963
If you had an alter ego,
you could party with Ivy

09:07.047 --> 09:09.841
without getting in trouble
with the Bat family.

09:09.924 --> 09:11.926
Do you have a breath mint?

09:12.010 --> 09:12.969
[retching]

09:13.053 --> 09:14.262
Don't want
any of those shrimp tails

09:14.346 --> 09:15.972
to get caught
in your pretty pink hair.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.265
All right.
Are we doing this?

09:17.349 --> 09:19.517
I've always wanted
to party in Vegas.

09:19.601 --> 09:21.102
So many people to analyze!

09:21.186 --> 09:23.521
Oh, no, you're not
coming out, four-eyes.

09:23.646 --> 09:25.148
This is a job for...

09:27.442 --> 09:28.526
Hargret.

09:28.651 --> 09:29.903
Yes!

09:30.028 --> 09:32.697
Do not leave me in the mirror,
you skank!

09:32.822 --> 09:34.657
[upbeat music playing]

09:39.162 --> 09:39.996
[gun clicks]

09:43.667 --> 09:46.961
-[gun clicking]
-[people exclaiming]

20:16.049 --> 20:21.513
the two dykes in closest
proximity to the birth
shall be the godparents.

20:21.638 --> 20:23.890
Hey, but screw tradition.
[chuckles]

20:24.015 --> 20:25.308
Harley and Ivy,

20:25.392 --> 20:27.852
would you do us the honor
of being godmothers?

20:27.936 --> 20:30.355
-Fuck yeah!
-Of course,
we'll be godparents.

20:30.480 --> 20:33.358
Okay, well, I'm gonna jet
back under the sea now.

20:33.441 --> 20:34.359
What do you mean?

20:34.484 --> 20:36.319
I wanna co-parent.

20:36.403 --> 20:38.071
We are gonna co-parent.

20:38.196 --> 20:41.658
I'm taking the first born
and you can have the rest
or whatever.

20:41.741 --> 20:45.620
You took care of me today
so I think you'll be
an okay Dad.

20:45.704 --> 20:47.706
-[chuckles]
-Peace.

20:52.627 --> 20:53.545
Ive.

20:53.628 --> 20:55.213
-What? Say it.
-I shouldn't...

20:55.296 --> 20:57.007
Well, now you...
Honey, you've gotta
say something now.

20:57.090 --> 21:00.802
Okay? Those sharklings
are like fugly.

21:00.885 --> 21:03.596
[gasps] Oh, my fucking God!
Thank you.

21:03.722 --> 21:07.058
I, I'm just so glad I'm not
the only full grown asshole.

21:07.142 --> 21:10.270
Mine was, like, wet,
but also, like, sticky?

21:10.395 --> 21:11.896
So sticky!

21:12.022 --> 21:14.607
[laughs]
I mean, that one looks
like a booger, right?

21:14.733 --> 21:16.484
[laughs]

21:16.568 --> 21:19.404
Oh, my God. This one's
just like a pair of googly eyes
stuck on a flaccid dong.

21:19.487 --> 21:21.698
He always has his eye on you.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.825
-Or is that his tooth?
-Oh, my God.

21:23.908 --> 21:26.911
Yeah, the little one
looked like it was
old and young

21:26.995 --> 21:30.081
and like, dead and alive,
all at the same time.

21:30.165 --> 21:33.084
Like a little baby
Benjamin Button with fins.

21:33.209 --> 21:35.545
-[both laugh]
-Yes! Yes!

21:36.921 --> 21:40.091
Ive, I decided to move in
with the Bat family.

21:40.216 --> 21:41.885
Whoa, what?

21:41.968 --> 21:44.429
It's just too hard
to integrate my new job
into my old life.

21:44.512 --> 21:45.513
I need to immerse myself

21:45.597 --> 21:48.058
in pure uncut hero culture

21:48.141 --> 21:49.726
until it becomes second nature.

21:49.809 --> 21:52.270
Yeah. Okay.
Go... Go for it.

21:52.354 --> 21:53.605
-Really?
-Yeah.

21:53.688 --> 21:58.193
I mean, this is us
figuring out how to make

21:58.276 --> 22:00.403
our new jobs work, right?

22:00.487 --> 22:02.280
Just, um, don't take too long.

22:02.364 --> 22:04.491
-[chuckles]
-Mmm.

22:04.616 --> 22:05.950
Oh, I almost forgot!

22:06.034 --> 22:09.204
I picked up a little something
at the buffet.

22:09.287 --> 22:11.790
Oh, God, no.
This one looks like
one of the babies.

22:11.915 --> 22:15.752
[laughs] Oh, no! It does!
The striped one.

22:15.835 --> 22:19.089
-[Harley] Open up.
-[both laugh]
