All right, yeah. Pretty fun. Future-Worm.

the checklist one more time.

-Doug!
-Dad!

00:39.915 --> 00:42.000
Three times isn't enough?

00:42.084 --> 00:43.836
You checked off "bug spray" so many times,

00:43.919 --> 00:45.254
you put a hole through the paper.

00:45.337 --> 00:48.841
Yeah, Dad, quit stressin'
and quadruple-check the "have fun" box.

00:48.924 --> 00:52.261
Nature's like a science theme park,
and I've been waiting all year to go.

00:52.344 --> 00:54.096
It's the perfect time of the year!

00:54.179 --> 00:55.681
To hunt birds.

00:55.764 --> 00:58.767
Get revenge for what
they've done to my people.

00:58.976 --> 01:01.728
Uh... And, uh, there you are,
roast marshmallows.

01:01.812 --> 01:03.188
I'm kinda hungry, I guess.

01:03.272 --> 01:05.899
Okay, everyone, electronic devices out.

01:05.983 --> 01:07.901
I'll take that. Hand it over, please.

01:07.985 --> 01:09.486
This is for me. There we go.

01:09.570 --> 01:11.905
It is the one time of year
where we get to leave

01:11.989 --> 01:13.532
all of our crazy devices behind

01:13.615 --> 01:17.286
and just submit to
the simplicity and beauty of nature.

01:17.369 --> 01:20.122
Surrounded by gorgeous trees and...

01:20.205 --> 01:22.416
And fishing, and hiking!

01:22.499 --> 01:23.834

01:32.759 --> 01:34.636
Dad, I figured you'd freak out,

01:34.720 --> 01:36.096
so I packed you something special

01:36.180 --> 01:38.390
to keep you safe from everything.

Aw, thanks, Danny!

Now let's go through
the list one more time.

01:46.690 --> 01:49.067
Enough's enough. You better man up!

01:49.151 --> 01:51.987
If nature throws danger at you,
you chew up that danger up

01:52.070 --> 01:54.031
and spit it back in nature's face!

01:54.114 --> 01:55.490

Wow, I've got to hand it to you, Danny.

when you touch 'em. Boop!

02:36.907 --> 02:38.367

02:45.332 --> 02:47.417
Predator of the simple-minded worm.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.211
To him, I'm a helpless foodstuff,

02:49.294 --> 02:50.587
a pawn of nature.

02:50.671 --> 02:53.340
Just another chump
