WEBVTT

00:02.502 --> 00:03.211
NOAH:
<i>All right.</i>

00:03.294 --> 00:04.421
Read 'em and weep.

00:04.504 --> 00:05.422
KELLY:
Or gloat.

00:05.505 --> 00:07.298
{\an4}STEVE:
No wonder you wanted
to play strip poker.

00:07.382 --> 00:08.591
NOAH:
I took stuff off.

00:08.675 --> 00:10.218
{\an5}DONNA:
Yeah, a sock.
How revealing.

00:10.301 --> 00:12.345
DAVID: Okay.
A pair of nines.

00:12.429 --> 00:15.098
I thought the phrase was unlucky
in love, lucky in cards.

00:15.181 --> 00:16.433
A pair of eights.

00:16.516 --> 00:18.268
Do earrings count?

00:18.351 --> 00:20.603
Not a chance. Two pair.

00:20.687 --> 00:22.272
{\an1}Three fours.
I'm gonna go call Matt.

00:22.355 --> 00:23.773
{\an3}Hmm.

00:23.857 --> 00:25.233
Oh, make sure you tell him
what fun you're having here

00:25.316 --> 00:27.068
while he's in New York
on business.

00:27.152 --> 00:29.028
All red over here, baby.

00:29.112 --> 00:30.280
Don't even ask.

00:30.363 --> 00:33.116
You know we could, we could, we
could stop this game right now.

00:33.199 --> 00:34.409
How come that offer

00:34.492 --> 00:35.618
wasn't available to me

00:35.702 --> 00:36.870
when I was
on a losing streak, huh?

00:36.953 --> 00:39.539
Because unlike most sane people,
you were actually enjoying it.

00:39.622 --> 00:41.291
I got it.
Here we go...

00:41.374 --> 00:42.959
{\an1}Whoo-hoo!
Lose it, sister.

00:43.042 --> 00:45.462
{\an1}Mm...
NOAH: Oh, yeah.

00:49.466 --> 00:50.925
{\an1}I still can't believe
you're a lawyer.

00:51.009 --> 00:53.303
{\an3}Why? Isn't that what I
always said I wanted to be?

00:53.386 --> 00:55.305
{\an1}Yeah, yeah.
But you did it.

00:55.388 --> 00:59.017
{\an1}I mean, despite everything,
you moved on.

00:59.100 --> 01:00.268
{\an3}So, um...

01:00.351 --> 01:03.480
I know this place isn't exactly
the Rainbow Room, but, uh...

01:03.563 --> 01:04.813
You kidding me?

01:04.897 --> 01:06.816
I've spent the last three years
in an institution

01:06.900 --> 01:08.318
telling anybody
who'd listen to me

01:08.401 --> 01:09.694
that a swarm of killer bees

01:09.778 --> 01:11.488
was going to assassinate
the president.

01:11.571 --> 01:13.114
{\an1}This is...

01:13.198 --> 01:14.991
This is amazing, Matt.

01:15.074 --> 01:16.284
Last fall, when Dr. Costas

01:16.367 --> 01:17.702
told me about clozapine

01:17.786 --> 01:20.121
and how it worked wonders
on some of his patients...

01:20.205 --> 01:21.956
Schizophrenics?

01:22.040 --> 01:24.751
Ugly word. Ugly disease.

01:24.834 --> 01:26.503
I didn't know what to do.

01:26.586 --> 01:27.712
{\an3}I tried not getting
my hopes up.

01:27.796 --> 01:29.631
And that is why I wasn't there.

01:29.714 --> 01:32.342
I woke up.

01:32.425 --> 01:37.013
{\an1}That's the only way
to describe it. I mean...

01:37.096 --> 01:39.140
{\an1}It's like I can see
everything clearly now.

01:39.224 --> 01:40.850
{\an1}Everything's come
into focus.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.018
I should have been there.

01:42.101 --> 01:43.019
You, you know...

01:43.102 --> 01:44.562
had a life. I didn't.

01:45.772 --> 01:49.526
But now I'm looking forward
to going to L.A. with you

01:49.609 --> 01:52.237
and putting all this behind us.

01:52.320 --> 01:53.571
Now, about that, L.A.

01:53.655 --> 01:55.073
Shouldn't you be
near your doctors?

01:55.156 --> 01:56.199
No.

01:56.282 --> 01:57.534
They've found a referral for me.

01:57.617 --> 01:58.493
Really?

01:58.576 --> 02:00.703
Oh.

02:00.787 --> 02:02.330
{\an1}I'm sorry.

02:02.413 --> 02:04.916
I, uh, I just assumed
that you would want me...

02:04.999 --> 02:06.543
In L.A. I do, of course.

02:06.626 --> 02:08.377
If you don't,
that's, that's fine.

02:08.461 --> 02:10.213
But I do.
That's okay.

02:14.259 --> 02:16.052
Good.

02:16.135 --> 02:17.971
'Cause that's where
I want to be.

02:23.351 --> 02:24.519
(groaning sharply)

02:24.602 --> 02:27.021
{\an1}I said three cards,
not two cards.

02:27.105 --> 02:28.731
Uh-huh. Strip, buddy.

02:28.815 --> 02:30.358
{\an3}How's Matt?

02:30.441 --> 02:32.235
{\an1}I don't know.
He wasn't in his room.

02:32.318 --> 02:33.862
I'm doing this under protest.

02:35.280 --> 02:36.906
(squealing)
(chuckling)

02:36.990 --> 02:41.035

04:31.604 --> 04:33.189
drug users,

04:33.272 --> 04:36.109
con men, thieves who cut a deal

04:36.192 --> 04:40.071
and got community service
instead of hard time.

04:40.154 --> 04:44.325
Rule number two:
Dirtbags do as I say.

04:44.409 --> 04:48.496
Rule number three:
Dirtbags don't do as I say,

04:48.579 --> 04:52.875
it's "good-bye, cushy deal"
and "hello, prison."

04:52.959 --> 04:57.046
Am... I... clear?

04:57.130 --> 04:58.548
LABORERS:
Yes, sir.

04:58.631 --> 05:02.218
You've got your assignments.
Now get to work.

05:02.301 --> 05:05.221
{\an5}DYLAN:
Well, that guy's a
real prince, huh?

05:05.304 --> 05:07.056
{\an3}Bro, I just want to
build this fence,

05:07.140 --> 05:08.891
do my 80 hours and move on.

05:08.975 --> 05:12.603
{\an1}That's what
he's counting on.

05:12.687 --> 05:14.230
Okay.

05:14.313 --> 05:16.065
Looks pretty simple to me.

05:21.320 --> 05:24.115
You know, work detail
usually means we have to work.

05:24.198 --> 05:26.200
{\an1}Bro, unless
you shore up this hill,

05:26.284 --> 05:29.287
{\an1}what you're doing
is gonna cause a slide, man.

05:29.370 --> 05:31.205
Problem, ladies?

05:31.289 --> 05:32.165
{\an3}Yes, sir. I
think we should

05:32.248 --> 05:33.583
{\an3}shore up this hill
with that netting, sir.

05:33.666 --> 05:35.251
You think?

05:35.334 --> 05:37.211
{\an3}Yes, sir, to prevent
a slide from happening.

05:37.295 --> 05:38.171
Listen, Joaquin,

05:38.254 --> 05:40.214
maybe something got lost
in the translation.

05:41.299 --> 05:43.259
We're putting up a fence
to prevent a slide.

05:43.342 --> 05:46.095
{\an1}I think he was just
trying to be helpful.

05:46.179 --> 05:49.098
Shut up, McKay. Julio,
you mouth off like that again,

05:49.182 --> 05:51.267
and I'm gonna boot
your illegal ass

05:51.350 --> 05:53.394
{\an3}back over the border
where it belongs.

05:57.648 --> 05:59.192
{\an3}I'm guessing he
doesn't like me, bro.

05:59.275 --> 06:00.443
Well, you're a quick study.

06:00.526 --> 06:02.111
{\an1}I'm Dylan.

06:02.195 --> 06:03.613
Ramon. What's up?

06:03.696 --> 06:04.989
Let's get to it, Ramon.

06:05.073 --> 06:06.115
{\an3}Yeah.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.910
STEVE:
<i>Hey. Good morning.</i>

06:08.993 --> 06:11.287
Hmm. Look at you,
wearing clothes and everything.

06:11.370 --> 06:12.455
{\an3}Oh, yeah.

06:12.538 --> 06:13.748
{\an1}Family jewels
back in the vault?

06:13.831 --> 06:14.749
(laughing)

06:14.832 --> 06:16.292
Safe and sound, Noah.

06:16.375 --> 06:17.335
{\an1}If I'd known how bad
a player you were, Steve,

06:17.418 --> 06:18.628
I'd have bet you for money.

06:18.711 --> 06:20.421
{\an3}Well, now that I know
how lucky you are,

06:20.505 --> 06:22.298
remind me not to take
you up on that offer.

06:22.381 --> 06:24.133
Hey. You did get
all the best hands.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.636
{\an1}Well, like Steve said,
I'm a lucky guy.

06:26.719 --> 06:27.637
I'll be at the club.

06:27.720 --> 06:28.805
Mm. Bye.

06:28.888 --> 06:30.348
NOAH:
I'll see ya.

06:31.557 --> 06:33.976
So, you're surprisingly
cheerful this morning.

06:34.060 --> 06:36.687
{\an3}Plotting revenge has
that effect on me.

06:36.771 --> 06:38.272
Aren't those Noah's glasses?

06:38.356 --> 06:40.942
{\an3}Yeah. The same ones
he said he was wearing

06:41.025 --> 06:43.027
{\an3}because his contact lenses
were bothering him.

06:43.111 --> 06:45.321
{\an1}And you're wearing
them because...

06:45.404 --> 06:48.116
{\an3}Did you ever hear the phrase,
"You make your own luck"?

06:48.199 --> 06:49.283
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

06:49.367 --> 06:50.785
{\an3}Noah certainly made
his. These cards,

06:50.868 --> 06:52.703
{\an3}they're marked.
What?

06:52.787 --> 06:54.497
I don't see anything.
Look through here.

06:56.207 --> 06:59.210
{\an1}Oh!

06:59.293 --> 07:01.796
He cheated!

07:01.879 --> 07:04.173
I have an idea how
to get back at him.

07:04.257 --> 07:05.174
Are you with me?

07:05.258 --> 07:07.218
{\an1}What?
Double-cross my boyfriend?

07:07.301 --> 07:09.345
{\an3}He did have you down
to your G-string.

07:09.428 --> 07:13.224
Oh, I am so in.

07:13.307 --> 07:14.308
(laughing)

07:14.392 --> 07:16.310
Yes.

07:17.895 --> 07:19.021
There you go.

07:19.105 --> 07:20.690
Hey, Nat, I thought
health inspections

07:20.773 --> 07:22.233
were supposed to
be unscheduled.

07:22.316 --> 07:24.944
{\an1}Yeah, a friend downtown tipped
me off that it's tomorrow.

07:25.027 --> 07:26.112
For here and the club.

07:26.195 --> 07:28.865
{\an3}Well, you have nothing to
worry about, though. Right?

07:28.948 --> 07:30.992
{\an1}(chuckles)
Enjoy the eggs.

07:33.077 --> 07:35.329
{\an3}(sobbing)

07:40.459 --> 07:42.253
Are you okay?

07:42.336 --> 07:44.755
Oh. Fine.

07:44.839 --> 07:47.842
Oh. Really? Well I'd hate
to see you when you're not.

07:47.925 --> 07:49.177
(chuckles)

07:49.260 --> 07:50.261
No. It's just this...

07:50.344 --> 07:52.054
This book I'm reading is so sad.

07:52.138 --> 07:53.890
What's it about?

07:53.973 --> 07:56.350
This meant-to-be couple
who have this chance meeting,

07:56.434 --> 08:00.229
fall in love, and then one
of them just disappears.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.273
Galley copy. What,
are you an editor?

08:02.356 --> 08:06.277
No, no. A development executive
at a studio.

08:06.360 --> 08:07.528
I read unpublished novels

08:07.612 --> 08:09.864
to see
if they would make good movies.

08:09.947 --> 08:12.700
{\an1}This one so would.
Oh.

08:12.783 --> 08:14.285
Tell me about it.

08:14.368 --> 08:17.538
{\an1}Uh, I hate to interrupt,
but we need you.

08:17.622 --> 08:20.082
Well, can it wait?

08:20.166 --> 08:21.751
Uh, actually, no. No.

08:21.834 --> 08:24.212
That's right.
Disappear on me.

08:24.295 --> 08:25.922
{\an3}(chuckles)

08:27.215 --> 08:29.217
This'd better be good.

08:29.300 --> 08:31.594
Oh, it is.
So, who's that?

08:31.677 --> 08:33.929
Someone I might have gotten to
know if you two hadn't shown up.

08:34.013 --> 08:35.347
(Steve groans)

08:40.311 --> 08:42.270
Hey.
Hi.

08:42.355 --> 08:43.481
You're back.

08:43.563 --> 08:44.607
How was your trip?

08:44.690 --> 08:46.817
It was great. I mean, you know,
good. I just got back.

08:46.901 --> 08:49.946
Yeah I-I called
you last night.

08:50.029 --> 08:51.614
{\an3}I thought maybe
you'd call me back.

08:51.697 --> 08:52.949
{\an1}Kelly, I'm sorry.
You know what I did?

08:53.032 --> 08:54.116
I unplugged the phone last night

08:54.200 --> 08:56.118
{\an1}to get some work done,
and, uh,

08:56.202 --> 08:57.286
well, I fell asleep
reading this deposition,

08:57.370 --> 08:59.956
and by the time I woke up,
I was lucky I caught the plane.

09:00.039 --> 09:02.750
You work way too hard.

09:02.833 --> 09:05.211
Tell me about it.
I'm late for a conference call.

09:05.294 --> 09:06.420
Go. Do.

09:06.504 --> 09:08.798
We'll have plenty of time
to catch up

09:08.881 --> 09:10.216
this weekend in Santa Barbara.

09:10.299 --> 09:12.134
Santa Barbara?

09:12.218 --> 09:13.803
Yeah. I made reservations
for us at the Miramar.

09:13.886 --> 09:14.971
Ocean-front room,

09:15.054 --> 09:17.139
everything.
It'll be great.

09:17.223 --> 09:17.807
Oh, Kelly...

09:17.890 --> 09:19.976
Don't worry about the money.

09:20.059 --> 09:22.144
It's on me.

09:22.228 --> 09:23.771
No. I just don't think

09:23.854 --> 09:25.439
I'm going to have everything
finished in time, that's all.

09:25.523 --> 09:28.359
Oh. Okay, whatever.

09:28.442 --> 09:30.778
Um, just let me know by tonight

09:30.861 --> 09:32.113
because I have
to tell the hotel.

09:32.196 --> 09:34.240
Okay, all right.

09:41.706 --> 09:42.873
Hurry up, will you?
He's in his office.

09:42.957 --> 09:45.167
I'm hurrying.

09:45.251 --> 09:46.252
{\an1}Explain to me
how this works again.

09:46.335 --> 09:48.170
CO2. It's the stuff
that puts the fizz in soda.

09:48.254 --> 09:49.380
It comes in tanks.

09:49.463 --> 09:51.173
(strained):
Like this one.

09:51.257 --> 09:54.176
It comes pressurized
at a preset amount

09:54.260 --> 09:55.344
so that when Noah pours a soda,

09:55.428 --> 09:57.138
it comes out nice and easy.

09:57.221 --> 09:58.681
But it we crank it up a bit...

09:58.764 --> 10:00.516
Niagara falls.

10:00.599 --> 10:02.351
Right on. What
do you think?

10:02.435 --> 10:05.021
{\an1}Well, uh, it's petty
and juvenile.

10:05.104 --> 10:06.230
Yeah, she loves it.

10:06.314 --> 10:07.189
(grunts)

10:07.273 --> 10:09.942
{\an3}Payback.

10:16.240 --> 10:17.283
{\an3}Hi.

10:17.366 --> 10:19.076
Hey. Come on in.
I was just, uh...

10:19.160 --> 10:20.536
{\an3}Redecorating. Yeah,
I can see that.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.538
I would have picked you up
at the hotel.

10:22.621 --> 10:24.373
I know.

10:24.457 --> 10:25.875
I felt like walking.

10:25.958 --> 10:27.251
Blend in.
Be like everybody else.

10:27.335 --> 10:30.338
Hmm. Everyone else drives.

10:30.421 --> 10:34.216
Oh, right. I keep thinking
New York. We didn't have a car.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.718
It blows my mind

10:35.801 --> 10:37.261
you moved to L.A.

10:37.345 --> 10:40.222
We talked about moving west.

10:40.306 --> 10:41.265
Yeah, to New Jersey.

10:41.349 --> 10:43.309
So I overshot a little.

10:43.392 --> 10:45.227
I wasn't running away from you.

10:45.311 --> 10:47.521
I know.

10:47.605 --> 10:49.649
I probably would have
done the same thing.

10:51.275 --> 10:53.194
{\an3}Oh, wow.

10:53.277 --> 10:56.072
Yeah, I finished
15th in my class.

10:56.155 --> 10:58.991
Not that it shows, but...

10:59.075 --> 11:01.160
{\an3}What shows is that you're
doing what you want...

11:01.243 --> 11:02.244
that you're happy.

11:02.328 --> 11:04.830
It's okay to admit it.

11:04.914 --> 11:07.208
Work's going all right.

11:07.291 --> 11:10.252
I didn't just mean with work.

11:10.336 --> 11:12.588
{\an3}I mean, do you have
a girlfriend?

11:12.671 --> 11:14.090
Lauren...

11:14.173 --> 11:15.424
I'm sure she's terrific.

11:15.508 --> 11:19.470
I care about her a great deal.

11:22.681 --> 11:24.058
Do you love her?

11:24.141 --> 11:26.435
It doesn't matter.

11:26.519 --> 11:27.770
It matters to me.

11:27.853 --> 11:28.938
You're here.

11:29.021 --> 11:31.065
That's what matters.

11:37.363 --> 11:39.490
(bluesy rock playing)

11:48.541 --> 11:49.750
{\an1}He's gotta
be running low.

11:49.834 --> 11:51.794
Yeah, one more tank
away from payback.

11:51.877 --> 11:54.630
{\an3}I know I should feel
badly about this,

11:54.713 --> 11:56.173
but I don't.

11:56.257 --> 12:00.136
So your day was fine.

12:00.219 --> 12:01.137
{\an1}(chuckles)

12:01.220 --> 12:02.179
{\an1}That's it?

12:02.263 --> 12:04.432
Yeah, pretty much.

12:04.515 --> 12:05.850
Oh, come on.

12:05.933 --> 12:08.269
You're a Beverly Hills guy
assigned to a chain gang.

12:08.352 --> 12:10.229
I know something interesting
had to happen today.

12:10.312 --> 12:13.190
{\an3}Well, for starters,
there were no chains.

12:13.274 --> 12:14.817
You know, what can I say?

12:14.900 --> 12:15.860
{\an3}I blend.

12:15.943 --> 12:17.319
Don't make me have
to pressure you.

12:17.403 --> 12:18.821
Then don't.

12:21.365 --> 12:23.284
I guess I'm just feeling...

12:23.367 --> 12:24.869
left out.

12:24.952 --> 12:28.497
Yeah, well, I'm feeling like
I'm just barely hanging on.

12:28.581 --> 12:29.999
You helped me, Gina,

12:30.082 --> 12:31.292
{\an3}you did.

12:31.375 --> 12:33.627
You, you still are helping me.

12:33.711 --> 12:37.631
It has to be my own way.

12:39.425 --> 12:40.801
{\an1}Hey!

12:40.885 --> 12:42.344
Oh, hey, Linda.

12:42.428 --> 12:44.805
Glad you could make it.

12:44.889 --> 12:45.806
Mm.

12:45.890 --> 12:47.850
{\an3}Hi, I'm
Linda Phillips.

12:47.933 --> 12:50.561
{\an3}I'm Dylan's sponsor
at Narcotics Anonymous.

12:50.644 --> 12:53.063
{\an1}If this is
a bad time, I can...

12:53.147 --> 12:56.358
Oh, no, actually, it's...
not a bad time.

12:58.277 --> 12:59.987
Uh, I'm sure
you two have

13:00.070 --> 13:03.365
a lot to talk about, so...

13:03.449 --> 13:04.492
Hey.

13:07.786 --> 13:09.288
Have a seat.

13:14.502 --> 13:15.586
{\an3}Oh, I can't
watch this.

13:15.669 --> 13:16.712
{\an3}Has he changed
tanks yet?

13:16.795 --> 13:17.880
Uh-uh, not yet.

13:21.342 --> 13:23.469
{\an1}Uh, ah, eh...
(clears throat)

13:24.637 --> 13:26.347
Hey, Noah,
can I get a refill?

13:26.430 --> 13:27.473
{\an3}Yeah, me, too.
Thanks.

13:27.556 --> 13:30.267
Six sodas each. What,
are you guys on a sugar high?

13:30.351 --> 13:32.061
Just thirsty.

13:36.315 --> 13:38.776
(laughing)

13:38.859 --> 13:41.195
Got him.

13:41.278 --> 13:43.030
{\an6}STEVE:
Are your clothes
a little wet?

13:43.113 --> 13:46.408
Why don't you take 'em off?
Display the family jewels.

13:46.492 --> 13:47.743
{\an3}Yeah, how are
those contacts?

13:47.826 --> 13:49.203
{\an3}Are they bothering
you a bit?

13:49.286 --> 13:50.871
I should have thrown those out.

13:50.955 --> 13:52.206
Yeah, probably.

13:52.289 --> 13:54.083
We're even, though, right?

13:54.166 --> 13:55.501
No, no!

13:59.088 --> 14:00.798
(phone beeps on, dialing)

14:01.799 --> 14:03.759
(distant phone rings)

14:03.842 --> 14:05.928
{\an5}MATT:
You've reached the office
of Matt Durning.

14:06.011 --> 14:07.388
Please leave a message.
(answering machine beeps)

14:07.471 --> 14:08.681
(phone beeps off)

14:14.186 --> 14:17.064
{\an1}I told you
I'm just out of practice.

14:17.147 --> 14:18.440
Yeah, which explains why

14:18.524 --> 14:20.776
{\an3}you ran not one
but two red lights.

14:20.859 --> 14:22.778
I know. I saw them.

14:22.861 --> 14:25.573
{\an1}I just, I couldn't process
what they meant.

14:25.656 --> 14:27.408
What?

14:27.491 --> 14:29.451
{\an1}Maybe I just wanted
to get back here

14:29.535 --> 14:30.995
as fast as I possibly could.

14:31.078 --> 14:32.121
Oh...

14:33.372 --> 14:35.374
Mm, come here.

14:36.875 --> 14:37.918
{\an3}Lauren...

14:38.877 --> 14:40.337
(exasperated sigh)

14:41.880 --> 14:44.341
I just wanted you to hold me,
Matt, that's all.

14:46.093 --> 14:49.263
{\an3}Right, right.
Sure.

14:49.346 --> 14:50.639
If I'd wanted more,

14:50.723 --> 14:52.141
would that have been so bad?

14:52.224 --> 14:54.768
{\an3}I just...

14:54.852 --> 14:56.770
{\an3}I want us
to take our time.

14:56.854 --> 14:59.023
Because of her?

14:59.106 --> 15:02.693
Because I want us
to do this right.

15:02.776 --> 15:04.528
You checked me
into a hotel.

15:04.612 --> 15:05.487
I told you...

15:05.571 --> 15:07.281
{\an1}I feel like
you're hiding me.

15:07.364 --> 15:08.616
{\an3}I have roommates.
They have girlfriends.

15:08.699 --> 15:10.784
{\an3}It's a zoo.

15:10.868 --> 15:13.120
{\an3}Besides, I want us
to be alone.

15:15.372 --> 15:17.666
{\an1}That's it?

15:17.750 --> 15:19.793
{\an3}I promise.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.216
Mm.
I'm sorry.

15:27.760 --> 15:31.347
See? Now this is nice.

15:31.430 --> 15:33.223
{\an1}(sighs)
You have no idea.

15:40.105 --> 15:41.690
(phone beeps on, dialing)

15:42.650 --> 15:44.193
(distant phone ringing)

15:44.276 --> 15:46.195
{\an5}MATT:
You've reached the office
of Matt Durning.

15:46.278 --> 15:47.696
Please leave a message.
(answering machine beeps)

15:47.780 --> 15:48.822
(phone beeps off)

15:50.157 --> 15:51.533
(sighs)

15:51.617 --> 15:55.204
(dialing)

15:56.997 --> 15:58.916
{\an5}OPERATOR:
Good evening.
How can I direct your call?

15:58.999 --> 16:00.250
Hi, is this the Miramar?

16:00.334 --> 16:01.293
Uh, yes, it is.

16:01.377 --> 16:04.338
I'd like to cancel a reservation
for this weekend.

16:04.421 --> 16:05.464
Just a moment. I'll connect you.

16:16.517 --> 16:23.232
"Polysorbate 20,
triolathyloamoid, glycerin."

16:23.315 --> 16:24.108
What the...?

16:24.191 --> 16:26.068
Ooh, nice hair.

16:26.151 --> 16:27.611
{\an3}I can't believe
you did this.

16:27.695 --> 16:30.364
You're so dead!

16:32.157 --> 16:33.909
{\an3}There you go.
Thank you.

16:35.327 --> 16:36.245
Hey.

16:36.328 --> 16:38.247
Kelly, uh, can we talk?

16:38.330 --> 16:39.873
Yeah. One sec.

16:39.957 --> 16:41.875
Talk.
About last night.

16:41.959 --> 16:43.419
I said I was gonna call you,
and I should have.

16:43.502 --> 16:48.215
{\an5}You make it sound
like an obligation.
I'm sorry.

16:48.298 --> 16:50.300
Look, I know that
you're really busy with work,

16:50.384 --> 16:54.096
but something just feels...
different between us.

16:54.179 --> 16:54.930
You're right, you're right,

16:55.013 --> 16:57.266
and the last few days
have been...

16:57.349 --> 16:58.934
{\an3}Did something happen
in New York?

16:59.017 --> 17:01.603
Because that's kind
of when it started.

17:01.687 --> 17:03.272
No.

17:03.355 --> 17:05.566
No?

17:05.648 --> 17:07.818
(chuckling):
No.

17:07.901 --> 17:10.069
{\an3}When I didn't hear from you
last night,

17:10.154 --> 17:12.156
I went ahead and canceled
our weekend reservations.

17:12.239 --> 17:14.241
And I think that's a good idea.

17:14.324 --> 17:17.118
He says way too quickly.

17:17.202 --> 17:19.079
No, something has come up.

17:23.040 --> 17:23.916
I have got to go.

17:24.001 --> 17:25.961
Well, hold on a second.
We're not finished.

17:26.044 --> 17:27.128
I know.
I have to work until 7:30,

17:27.212 --> 17:30.090
but why don't we meet at the
club and we'll talk then?

17:30.174 --> 17:31.216
No excuses this time.

17:37.055 --> 17:39.141
{\an3}Ah, Nat, when's
the big inspection?

17:39.224 --> 17:40.809
Anytime now.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.144
And I can't
tell you how...

17:42.227 --> 17:44.396
Could you hold
that thought?

17:46.064 --> 17:48.108
NAT:
I appreciate your concern.

17:48.192 --> 17:50.110
How's the book?

17:50.194 --> 17:52.446
{\an3}(chuckles)
Still amazing.

17:52.529 --> 17:55.324
Mm. Listen, I'm really
sorry about yesterday.

17:55.407 --> 17:56.325
You mind?

17:56.408 --> 17:57.326
Oh, no.

17:57.409 --> 17:58.827
Thanks. I'm David.

17:58.911 --> 17:59.828
{\an3}I'm Carole.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.705
Hi.
Hi.

18:04.541 --> 18:05.834
(sighs)

18:05.918 --> 18:08.337
{\an1}You know, I was, I was
thinking about the story,

18:08.420 --> 18:10.047
and it reminds me
of this-this film

18:10.130 --> 18:12.257
{\an1}that I, I love called
<i>Cinema Paradiso.</i>

18:12.341 --> 18:14.092
{\an3}Oh, my God, that's one
of my favorites.

18:14.176 --> 18:15.302
{\an3}The way he waits
for her...

18:15.385 --> 18:16.095
{\an1}Every night
for five months.

18:16.178 --> 18:17.429
{\an1}And hen when they're
finally in love,

18:17.513 --> 18:18.847
he goes off to war.

18:18.931 --> 18:21.058
{\an5}And when he gets
back, she's gone.
She's gone.

18:21.141 --> 18:23.227
It's pretty much the most
romantic movie ever.

18:23.310 --> 18:26.146
Yeah, I think so.

18:26.230 --> 18:28.482
Anyway, what made me think
of it was,

18:28.565 --> 18:30.692
I noticed that
it's playing tonight

18:30.776 --> 18:32.361
at the Golden Ticket
in Santa Monica.

18:32.444 --> 18:36.156
Really? Well, I'd...
love to see it.

18:36.240 --> 18:37.199
Really?

18:37.282 --> 18:39.701
Well, um, maybe...
maybe we could go together.

18:39.785 --> 18:41.912
That would be great.

18:41.995 --> 18:44.373
Great.

18:44.456 --> 18:47.125
Let me see
what time it's playing.

18:47.209 --> 18:50.170
You know, I-I live around the
corner from the Golden Ticket.

18:50.254 --> 18:51.839
I'll meet you there.

18:51.922 --> 18:53.006
How's 7:15?

18:53.090 --> 18:54.049
{\an3}Oh, sure.

18:54.132 --> 18:55.217
Great.

18:55.300 --> 18:58.053
{\an1}Listen, um, I work
at the club next door.

18:58.136 --> 19:00.681
Not saying that anything's
gonna happen, but just in case,

19:00.764 --> 19:03.433
{\an1}I was thinking maybe I could
get your, your number.

19:03.517 --> 19:04.518
Oh, my number.

19:04.601 --> 19:05.894
{\an3}Right.
Yeah.

19:05.978 --> 19:08.522
(goofy chuckle)
Noah's a dead man.

19:08.605 --> 19:09.731
(malevolent laugh)

19:09.815 --> 19:12.568
Isn't that your friend?

19:12.651 --> 19:15.195
{\an3}Yeah, I think so.
(soft chuckle)

19:16.321 --> 19:18.282
Would you relax?

19:18.365 --> 19:19.575
We might've missed
some spots, okay?

19:19.658 --> 19:21.368
{\an3}Look, the
club's spotless.

19:21.451 --> 19:23.203
{\an3}The inspection's
gonna be a breeze.

19:23.287 --> 19:24.705
Noah Hunter?

19:24.788 --> 19:25.706
Yeah.

19:25.789 --> 19:27.416
Hal Zaret.
Health department.

19:27.499 --> 19:28.625
Here to inspect
your place.

19:28.709 --> 19:31.712
{\an3}Sure. Where do you
want to start?

19:31.795 --> 19:34.256
(animal squeaking)

19:39.261 --> 19:41.388
(laughs)

19:44.016 --> 19:45.100
Nice.

19:45.183 --> 19:46.310
I don't know how
that got here.

19:46.393 --> 19:47.311
Uh-huh.

19:47.394 --> 19:49.229
Look, I don't have rats.

19:49.313 --> 19:50.105
(squeaks)

19:50.188 --> 19:51.231
{\an3}Look out!

19:51.315 --> 19:53.233
Sanders!

19:53.317 --> 19:54.610
Somebody call me?

19:54.693 --> 19:55.444
Oh, my God!

19:55.527 --> 19:57.237
It's good, huh?
Oh, well, look at you.

19:57.321 --> 19:58.405
You're a little
green yourself.

19:58.488 --> 19:59.615
{\an3}Look, being funny
is one thing,

19:59.698 --> 20:00.616
but my business is...

20:00.699 --> 20:02.159
{\an1}Oh, come on.
I'll catch the rat.

20:02.242 --> 20:03.952
And Hal, well, Hal isn't
even really an inspector.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.621
{\an1}He's just some guy
that I hired

20:05.704 --> 20:06.455
to put one over on you.

20:06.538 --> 20:07.414
{\an1}We got him,
didn't we, Hal?

20:07.497 --> 20:09.166
(gasping)

20:11.335 --> 20:12.544
{\an1}DONNA:
Are you all right?

20:12.628 --> 20:14.129
(groans)

20:14.212 --> 20:15.130
{\an3}Oh, God.

20:15.213 --> 20:16.798
(all gasp)

20:18.008 --> 20:20.469
{\an6}Nothing.
Nothing?! What
do you mean nothing?

20:20.552 --> 20:22.179
{\an5}No pulse!
He's dead?
Dead?!

20:22.262 --> 20:23.263
(screams)
What do you mean, "dead"?!

20:23.347 --> 20:25.682
{\an5}He can't be dead!
Is he dead?
Yeah, he's dead.

20:25.766 --> 20:27.976
All right, here's what
we do: Donna, call 911

20:28.060 --> 20:29.937
and stall the inspector
when he gets here. Go!

20:30.020 --> 20:33.273
I didn't tell him about the rat.
I wanted him to look surprised.

20:33.357 --> 20:34.441
{\an3}He looked surprised
all right.

20:34.524 --> 20:35.484
What are you doing?!

20:35.567 --> 20:36.485
I'm moving him before

20:36.568 --> 20:37.986
the inspector gets here.

20:38.070 --> 20:38.987
He's parking the car!

20:39.071 --> 20:40.322
{\an1}He'll be here any second!
What are you doing?!

20:40.405 --> 20:41.615
{\an4}STEVE:
Oh, we're hiding
the body.

20:41.698 --> 20:43.951
{\an1}Oh, my God!
What, are you insane?!

20:44.034 --> 20:45.535
MAN:
Hello? Health Department here.

20:45.619 --> 20:47.829
{\an1}Oh, we're dead.
Not if we get the door.

20:47.913 --> 20:48.330
{\an3}What door?!

20:48.413 --> 20:49.498
The Peach Pit kitchen.

20:49.581 --> 20:51.166
{\an3}Where are you
gonna put him?!

20:51.250 --> 20:52.668
The refrigerator?
Yeah, a spare one.

20:52.751 --> 20:55.170
That's where he'd be
if he was in a morgue.

20:55.253 --> 20:56.171
Come on. Help me.

20:56.254 --> 20:57.297
{\an3}Help you?!

20:57.381 --> 21:00.342
{\an1}Here you go, old boy.
Sorry.

21:00.425 --> 21:02.260
{\an5}DONNA:
Actually, there's nothing
in here.

21:02.344 --> 21:04.012
Nothing at all.

21:04.096 --> 21:07.933
{\an3}Noah, look who's here.
It's the health inspector.

21:08.016 --> 21:08.892
How you doing?

21:08.976 --> 21:10.644
{\an1}Why don't we start
in the bar?

21:15.065 --> 21:16.316
{\an3}(shrieks)

21:19.319 --> 21:22.698
{\an1}So, you work two jobs
and go to night school.

21:22.781 --> 21:25.409
Yeah. I'm studying for my
contractor's license, bro.

21:25.492 --> 21:27.828
{\an1}Wow, and you support
a family?

21:27.911 --> 21:30.038
My oldest is gonna
be two next week.

21:30.122 --> 21:32.040
Okay, everybody,
lunch break.

21:32.124 --> 21:36.169
One half hour.
You, too, girls.

21:39.131 --> 21:41.216
{\an1}So, how'd you end up here
with us losers, man?

21:41.299 --> 21:43.218
{\an1}You flunk a Cub Scout
quiz or something?

21:43.301 --> 21:45.429
{\an3}No, man. I fell
asleep driving home

21:45.512 --> 21:47.180
from my, uh,
night shift.

21:47.264 --> 21:48.724
Hit a parked car.

21:48.807 --> 21:50.434
Got charged with
reckless driving.

21:50.517 --> 21:52.227
What is this?

21:52.310 --> 21:55.856
You got to be kidding.

21:55.939 --> 21:58.066
I hate to break it
to you, Jose,

21:58.150 --> 22:00.068
but you don't need
a contractor's license

22:00.152 --> 22:01.570
to build adobe huts.

22:01.653 --> 22:04.740
His name isn't Jose, it's Ramon.

22:04.823 --> 22:06.199
Was anybody talking to you?

22:08.035 --> 22:10.245
{\an1}Here.

22:10.328 --> 22:13.415
Maybe you didn't hear me.

22:13.498 --> 22:14.916
No, I heard you pretty good.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.752
{\an3}Look, let it go, Dylan.
Just let it go, bro.

22:18.545 --> 22:21.923
{\an1}And I had you down
as one of the good ones.

22:22.007 --> 22:23.425
Yeah, well, you were wrong.

22:29.848 --> 22:31.308
{\an3}Congratulations,
Mr. Hunter.

22:31.391 --> 22:32.434
{\an3}The place
looks great.

22:32.517 --> 22:34.102
That is good news.

22:34.186 --> 22:36.480
Thank you.

22:36.563 --> 22:37.481
What'd he say?

22:37.564 --> 22:38.356
{\an3}I passed,
no problem.

22:38.440 --> 22:39.941
Paramedics are gonna
be here any minute.

22:40.025 --> 22:41.610
{\an3}I know.
Come on.

22:42.652 --> 22:43.987
What...?

22:45.363 --> 22:47.407
{\an3}Tell me I'm not seeing
what I think I'm seeing.

22:47.491 --> 22:49.785
What happened
to the extra fridge?

22:50.368 --> 22:51.745
(Nat whistling)

22:51.828 --> 22:54.748
Nat,
what happened to the fridge?

22:54.831 --> 22:56.249
The salvage guys
just left with it.

22:56.333 --> 22:57.334
{\an4}NOAH:
Salvage guys--
I forgot.

22:57.417 --> 22:59.669
{\an6}Noah!
I've had a few things
on my mind, okay?

22:59.753 --> 23:02.005
We got a call about a body.

23:02.089 --> 23:04.341
A call? About a body?

23:04.424 --> 23:05.926
{\an3}Yeah, at the Peach
Pit After Dark.

23:06.009 --> 23:06.968
Someone having
a heart attack.

23:07.052 --> 23:07.969
Heart attack?

23:08.053 --> 23:09.137
{\an1}Uh, did-did you guys
hear anything

23:09.221 --> 23:10.472
{\an1}about someone
having a heart attack?

23:10.555 --> 23:12.307
{\an6}Nope.
It's probably
a kid I carded.

23:12.390 --> 23:13.642
{\an3}He crank-called,
you know.

23:13.725 --> 23:14.643
Oh, uh, right,

23:14.726 --> 23:15.936
{\an1}because maybe
you-you wouldn't,

23:16.019 --> 23:17.104
uh, let him...

23:17.187 --> 23:18.021
Let him in last night.

23:18.105 --> 23:20.482
And there were
lots of bodies here, so...

23:20.565 --> 23:21.650
{\an1}DONNA:
Which unlike now--

23:21.733 --> 23:23.318
{\an1}you can see
there's, there's no bodies.

23:23.401 --> 23:24.152
No, no bodies.

23:24.236 --> 23:26.905
Nice hair.

23:30.742 --> 23:34.621
{\an4}DAVID:
Gina, Linda is
Dylan's sponsor.

23:34.704 --> 23:37.124
{\an6}GINA:
What? All I said was, I hope
she falls off the wagon.

23:37.207 --> 23:38.667
{\an1}Why? Because
she's beautiful?

23:38.750 --> 23:40.085
No.
No?

23:40.168 --> 23:41.044
No.

23:41.128 --> 23:41.837
{\an1}Okay.
Come on, David.

23:41.920 --> 23:43.338
I was with Dylan
when he was using.

23:43.421 --> 23:44.673
You know, I was
there with him

23:44.756 --> 23:45.882
{\an3}when he was going
through withdrawals,

23:45.966 --> 23:47.134
puking everywhere.

23:47.217 --> 23:48.176
I mean, all of the
sudden, he's sober,

23:48.260 --> 23:49.970
and now he's gonna hang
out with someone else.

23:50.053 --> 23:51.138
{\an3}Yes, that pisses me
off a little bit.

23:51.221 --> 23:53.056
{\an1}Yeah, she understands
his problems.

23:53.140 --> 23:54.307
{\an3}What are you
talking about?

23:54.391 --> 23:56.309
I live with it.

23:56.393 --> 23:58.061
Gina, I know this is
hard for you, okay?

23:58.145 --> 23:59.980
But your gonna have
to follow his lead

24:00.063 --> 24:01.022
or it's not gonna work.

24:01.106 --> 24:02.065
(laughs)

24:02.149 --> 24:03.316
What?

24:03.400 --> 24:04.568
{\an3}What's that? Are
you giving me,

24:04.651 --> 24:05.861
{\an3}like, the radio
treatment right now?

24:05.944 --> 24:07.362
{\an3}Oh, yeah.
Yeah?

24:07.445 --> 24:08.488
Is it good?

24:08.572 --> 24:10.365
No. It's not. I
mean, basically,

24:10.448 --> 24:12.284
for someone with no life,
you give okay advice.

24:12.367 --> 24:14.661
I had no life.

24:14.744 --> 24:16.163
Okay, as of this evening,

24:16.246 --> 24:17.539
my futility streak is over.

24:17.622 --> 24:19.875
Oh, new prospect?

24:19.958 --> 24:21.168
Oh, more than that.

24:21.251 --> 24:22.085
{\an1}The first time
we met, uh,

24:22.169 --> 24:24.504
we were finishing
each other's sentences.

24:24.588 --> 24:25.505
It was good.

24:25.589 --> 24:27.507
How nice for you.

24:29.968 --> 24:33.013
At least someone deserves

24:33.096 --> 24:34.431
to be happy.

24:34.514 --> 24:36.057
{\an3}Wow.

24:36.141 --> 24:38.518
You and Dylan will be fine.

24:38.602 --> 24:41.813
{\an3}I'm not talking
about me and Dylan.

24:44.149 --> 24:45.233
My goodness.

24:45.317 --> 24:46.318
Mm-hmm.

25:05.337 --> 25:07.088
{\an1}All I'm saying is,
I should have told him.

25:07.172 --> 25:08.757
For the 85th time,
we did not kill him.

25:08.840 --> 25:11.426
{\an1}No, I just scared
the life out of him.

25:11.509 --> 25:13.929
{\an1}Oh, my God,
look at this place.

25:14.012 --> 25:15.096
{\an1}Excuse me.
It's a disaster.

25:15.180 --> 25:16.097
Excuse me, sir.

25:16.181 --> 25:18.099
I'm Noah Hunter.
I run the Peach Pit After Dark.

25:18.183 --> 25:18.975
Oh, yeah, right.

25:19.059 --> 25:21.269
Sent some guys
over there this morning.

25:21.353 --> 25:22.437
Yeah, for a refrigerator.

25:22.520 --> 25:23.355
Look, there's been a mistake.

25:23.438 --> 25:25.815
{\an1}And we kind of need
the refrigerator back.

25:25.899 --> 25:27.234
{\an1}Uh, that's no problem.
Really?

25:27.317 --> 25:28.693
Great. Where is it?

25:28.777 --> 25:29.986
Uh, it's, uh, right there.

25:33.990 --> 25:35.283
Maybe we didn't
make ourselves clear.

25:35.367 --> 25:37.077
We're looking for
a refrigerator.

25:37.160 --> 25:39.412
{\an1}Yeah, you know,
industrial-sized, like,

25:39.496 --> 25:43.083
one big enough to fit,
I don't know, like, a person in.

25:43.166 --> 25:44.793
Well, not anymore.

25:44.876 --> 25:45.961
That thing right
there, that's it?

25:46.044 --> 25:47.462
Yeah, crushed
and compressed.

25:47.545 --> 25:49.214
{\an1}Crushed?
Crushed?

25:49.297 --> 25:50.173
Compressed?
Compressed?

25:50.257 --> 25:51.508
MANAGER:
Ready for recycling.

25:51.591 --> 25:53.760
Hey, nice look.

25:56.388 --> 25:57.264
{\an3}Man...

25:57.347 --> 25:59.975
{\an3}It's funny how the, the
doctor told us about

26:00.058 --> 26:01.726
{\an3}the possible side
effects of clozapine,

26:01.810 --> 26:04.938
{\an3}he failed to mention it would
turn you into a shopaholic.

26:05.021 --> 26:06.147
(laughs)

26:06.231 --> 26:07.816
Aren't you the one
who keeps saying we need

26:07.899 --> 26:09.276
to make up for lost time?

26:09.359 --> 26:11.778
{\an3}Yeah, well, I didn't mean
in the shoe department.

26:11.861 --> 26:14.155
(chuckles)

26:14.239 --> 26:17.200
{\an1}I get the feeling that
people are staring at us?

26:17.284 --> 26:18.493
I can't imagine why.

26:18.576 --> 26:19.869
{\an1}Yeah, maybe they think
we're crazy!

26:19.953 --> 26:20.870
Yeah, maybe.

26:20.954 --> 26:22.247
{\an1}(laughs)

26:26.293 --> 26:28.795
We're not though, are we?

26:28.878 --> 26:30.714
Lauren, don't...
No, not me.

26:30.797 --> 26:32.632
I-I mean, us.

26:32.716 --> 26:35.635
{\an1}For, you know,
being together and...

26:35.719 --> 26:37.554
trying to make this work

26:37.637 --> 26:39.681
after all the stuff
we've been through.

26:39.764 --> 26:42.183
No, no, we are not crazy.

26:42.267 --> 26:46.062
Because if this isn't
gonna work, I mean,

26:46.146 --> 26:47.731
if you have any doubts at all,

26:47.814 --> 26:49.774
I... I'm not sure
I even want to try.

26:49.858 --> 26:51.693
You know, at first--

26:51.776 --> 26:53.695
and this is gonna sound
ridiculous-- but at first,

26:53.778 --> 26:55.322
I envied you,

26:55.405 --> 26:58.533
not being able to understand
how awful it felt being apart.

26:58.616 --> 27:00.160
You can't imagine

27:00.243 --> 27:02.037
ever getting over the sadness.

27:02.120 --> 27:04.039
Until you do.

27:04.122 --> 27:05.040
No, you don't.

27:05.123 --> 27:06.583
But it dulls.

27:06.666 --> 27:09.252
{\an3}I didn't plan on
meeting anyone else.

27:09.336 --> 27:10.628
You got to believe that.

27:13.590 --> 27:14.507
What's her name?

27:14.591 --> 27:16.551
Kelly.

27:16.634 --> 27:19.721
Okay, listen.

27:19.804 --> 27:21.514
I've already ruined
your life once...

27:21.598 --> 27:23.099
{\an1}No, you didn't.
Yes, I did.

27:23.183 --> 27:26.561
And I have no intention
of ruining it again, okay?

27:26.644 --> 27:30.273
So, if you are happy
with the way your life is,

27:30.357 --> 27:32.025
I want you to live it.

27:42.327 --> 27:43.495
Hey.

27:43.578 --> 27:46.081
Hi. How's Dylan?

27:46.164 --> 27:49.084
{\an3}Oh, uh, well, his
recovery is going great.

27:49.167 --> 27:50.210
(wry chuckle)

27:50.293 --> 27:52.045
That's an awfully
specific answer.

27:52.128 --> 27:53.296
Yeah, I know.

27:53.380 --> 27:54.923
{\an1}You know that moment
in a relationship

27:55.006 --> 27:57.425
{\an1}when you really think
it's gonna work?

27:57.509 --> 27:58.426
{\an3}Yeah.

27:58.510 --> 28:00.261
I hate that moment.

28:00.345 --> 28:02.263
{\an3}Well, usually in
my experience,

28:02.347 --> 28:05.475
just when you get comfortable
is when the other shoe drops.

28:05.558 --> 28:06.810
Right, yeah.

28:06.893 --> 28:08.269
Well, Dylan is hanging out

28:08.353 --> 28:11.106
{\an1}with the supermodel
of recovering addicts.

28:11.189 --> 28:12.941
Mm, bonding over

28:13.024 --> 28:14.025
{\an1}shared trauma,
as I'm sure.

28:14.109 --> 28:16.111
{\an3}Yes, and I'm not really
sure what to do about it.

28:16.194 --> 28:18.822
{\an3}You know, if lets say Matt
was hanging out with someone

28:18.905 --> 28:21.950
who you hardly knew, how
would you feel about it?

28:22.033 --> 28:24.119
I would trust him.

28:24.202 --> 28:25.453
{\an3}Really?

28:25.537 --> 28:26.579
(chuckles)

28:26.663 --> 28:28.832
What, just because you guys
have had this big moment

28:28.915 --> 28:30.125
where you're sure
everything's gonna work out?

28:30.208 --> 28:31.334
Exactly.

28:31.418 --> 28:32.460
{\an3}Well, I mean,
you just

28:32.544 --> 28:34.754
got through saying that
once you let your guard down,

28:34.838 --> 28:36.214
if you get a little
vulnerable, that...

28:36.297 --> 28:37.757
Gina...
Yeah?

28:37.841 --> 28:39.300
...do you have something
you want to say to me?

28:39.384 --> 28:40.969
Well, kind of.

28:41.052 --> 28:41.970
{\an3}Um...

28:42.053 --> 28:43.221
Then say it.

28:43.304 --> 28:45.765
Okay. Um...

28:46.850 --> 28:47.767
See, I'm probably making

28:47.851 --> 28:49.310
more out of this than it is.

28:49.394 --> 28:51.980
It's just that
I think maybe Matt...

28:52.063 --> 28:53.523
might be seeing someone else.

29:00.405 --> 29:02.824
You broke into their
house, waving a gun?

29:02.907 --> 29:04.993
{\an1}Uh, no, actually,
I was let in,

29:05.076 --> 29:07.871
{\an1}and then I started
waving the gun.

29:07.954 --> 29:10.957
Did I mention I was whacked out
on heroin at the time?

29:11.040 --> 29:13.334
{\an3}So that's all
over now, right?

29:13.418 --> 29:15.211
As much as it ever is.

29:15.295 --> 29:17.172
{\an1}I mean, I'm in
recovery right now.

29:17.255 --> 29:18.715
So what's next?

29:18.798 --> 29:20.300
I don't know, Ramon.

29:20.383 --> 29:23.178
Right now I can't see past
building this fence right here.

29:23.261 --> 29:24.220
Hey, but you
have to, bro,

29:24.304 --> 29:26.139
{\an3}or you'll be building fences
the rest of your life.

29:26.222 --> 29:28.224
Oh, watch out!

29:29.559 --> 29:32.020
{\an3}Damn it, didn't I tell you
to shore up that hill?!

29:32.103 --> 29:33.521
{\an1}Yeah, well,
you didn't, he did!

29:33.605 --> 29:34.522
Yeah, sir, y-you did.

29:34.606 --> 29:35.565
It was our mistake, man.

29:35.648 --> 29:36.691
Wait, hey, wait a minute.

29:36.774 --> 29:38.026
{\an1}This guy almost died
over here!

29:38.109 --> 29:38.985
{\an3}But he didn't,
did he?!

29:39.068 --> 29:40.862
{\an3}All right, everybody,
excitement's over.

29:40.945 --> 29:41.863
Get back to work!

29:41.946 --> 29:43.198
{\an1}I think you owe him
an apology.

29:43.281 --> 29:45.200
{\an3}I said, get
back to work.

29:45.283 --> 29:46.576
I said, apologize.

29:46.659 --> 29:47.911
{\an3}You're gonna pay
for this, pal.

29:47.994 --> 29:50.288
In that case...

29:52.332 --> 29:53.249
{\an3}Aw, Dylan!

29:53.333 --> 29:54.375
{\an3}Man, what are
you doing, bro?!

29:54.459 --> 29:56.377
You just got our
sentences extended!

29:56.461 --> 29:58.046
{\an3}Yeah, you're welcome.
Oh, you want me

29:58.129 --> 30:00.590
to thank you for costing me
a shot at my licensing exam?

30:00.673 --> 30:02.175
Look, that guy was wrong, Ramon.

30:02.258 --> 30:05.595
{\an3}Dylan, I told you, bro,
80 hours in and out.

30:05.678 --> 30:06.804
I got goals, man.

30:06.888 --> 30:10.058
{\an3}Just because you don't doesn't
mean you can mess with mine!

30:16.314 --> 30:18.691
{\an3}He had a wife...
two kids.

30:18.775 --> 30:20.276
We have to talk to her.

30:20.360 --> 30:21.319
And tell her what?

30:21.402 --> 30:23.404
{\an3}That we had a rat scare
her husband to death,

30:23.488 --> 30:25.281
and then we tossed him
inside a refrigerator,

30:25.365 --> 30:27.242
and then we had that
crushed into a cube?

30:27.325 --> 30:28.243
I don't think so.

30:28.326 --> 30:29.577
Well, I know
she'll be upset...

30:29.661 --> 30:31.412
Upset?! Upset?!

30:31.496 --> 30:33.581
{\an3}She's gonna have us
thrown in jail.

30:33.665 --> 30:35.625
Six months from now, I'll
be playing wide receiver

30:35.708 --> 30:37.126
{\an3}for the entire
cell block.

30:37.210 --> 30:39.295
Would you stop, please?

30:39.379 --> 30:40.421
This woman just
lost her husband.

30:40.505 --> 30:42.298
What we have to do is tell her.

30:42.382 --> 30:43.758
We? I don't think so.

30:43.841 --> 30:45.343
{\an3}You don't think
you're a part of this?

30:45.426 --> 30:47.095
Look, I had the cube
delivered back here.

30:47.178 --> 30:49.180
And it wasn't my prank, Steve.

30:54.519 --> 30:56.521
(dialing)

30:59.440 --> 31:00.441
(cell phone beeps)

31:05.196 --> 31:06.614
Carole.

31:08.575 --> 31:11.494
I'm sorry, is this,
is this 555-0134?

31:13.496 --> 31:15.498
And there's no Carole there?

31:18.418 --> 31:20.128
Okay.

31:20.211 --> 31:22.255
Thank you. Sorry.

31:34.892 --> 31:36.311
(sighs softly)

31:38.062 --> 31:40.106
(R&amp;B music playing)

31:44.736 --> 31:47.280
Did you have
a tough day?

31:47.363 --> 31:49.449
Yeah.

31:49.532 --> 31:50.491
Yes?

31:50.575 --> 31:51.868
{\an1}Oh, yes.

31:51.951 --> 31:53.661
{\an3}Well, you don't have
to talk about it.

31:53.745 --> 31:56.748
{\an3}I mean, it's very
important that you know

31:56.831 --> 32:00.084
{\an3}that you don't have to
talk about anything.

32:07.759 --> 32:08.676
Really?

32:08.760 --> 32:10.303
Yes.

32:10.386 --> 32:13.181
{\an3}I'm just gonna take
your clothes off

32:13.264 --> 32:14.974
and put you
in the bath,

32:15.058 --> 32:18.186
put you to bed.

32:18.269 --> 32:19.354
Well, that's it?

32:19.437 --> 32:20.855
I mean...

32:22.815 --> 32:25.526
{\an3}I know that you're probably
too tired to do anything else.

32:25.610 --> 32:27.612
And I really
understand.

32:29.280 --> 32:31.282
(moans softly)

32:34.744 --> 32:36.245
{\an1}Yeah, I could muster
some strength.

32:36.329 --> 32:37.705
{\an3}You think so?
Oh, yeah.

32:37.789 --> 32:38.831
Are you sure?

32:38.915 --> 32:40.166
{\an3}Because we're going
at your pace.

32:40.249 --> 32:41.084
Oh, you know,
y-you're just,

32:41.167 --> 32:43.378
{\an1}y-you're gonna have
to trust me on this one.

32:50.301 --> 32:51.552
Um, sir.

32:51.636 --> 32:53.054
{\an1}Sir, uh,
the previews are done.

32:53.137 --> 32:54.514
The movie's about to start.

32:54.597 --> 32:55.515
You know what?

32:55.598 --> 32:57.016
{\an3}I, uh, I changed
my mind.

32:57.100 --> 32:58.226
I-I've decided
not to see it.

32:58.309 --> 32:59.519
{\an3}Can I get a
refund on these?

32:59.602 --> 33:00.561
{\an1}I'm sorry.

33:00.645 --> 33:03.106
No refunds.

33:03.189 --> 33:04.565
Thanks.

33:09.987 --> 33:12.615
(phone ringing)

33:12.699 --> 33:14.117
No, don't get it.

33:14.200 --> 33:16.244
Yeah?

33:16.327 --> 33:17.787
Oh, Linda?

33:17.870 --> 33:20.248
Hey, how you doing?

33:20.331 --> 33:22.208
Yeah, um, hold, hold on.

33:22.291 --> 33:23.918
Could you give me a second?

33:24.001 --> 33:25.920
Are you serious?

33:26.003 --> 33:28.005
Yeah.

33:28.089 --> 33:30.466
{\an3}No, no, no, I was
talking to someone.

33:30.550 --> 33:32.218
Go to hell, Dylan.

33:32.301 --> 33:33.886
Uh... (sighs)

33:36.347 --> 33:39.767
Well, I kind of got
into this fight today,

33:39.851 --> 33:42.979
and, uh, you know,
it just left me feeling

33:43.062 --> 33:47.108
like I wanted to go get high
somewhere and...

33:47.191 --> 33:49.110
Well...

33:49.193 --> 33:51.320
Mm-hmm.

33:51.404 --> 33:53.322
Yeah.

33:56.534 --> 33:58.953
I misunderstood.

33:59.036 --> 34:01.080
{\an1}I thought we were
meeting at the club.

34:01.164 --> 34:05.126
You didn't misunderstand.

34:05.209 --> 34:07.920
Then what happened?

34:08.004 --> 34:11.591
I don't know, why
don't you tell me?

34:11.674 --> 34:12.925
Kelly, I...

34:13.009 --> 34:14.302
I trusted you, Matt.

34:14.385 --> 34:16.637
{\an3}I actually believed
that you cared about me.

34:16.721 --> 34:17.929
I do. You don't understand.

34:18.014 --> 34:20.850
The worst part about it is that
you didn't even try to hide it.

34:20.933 --> 34:22.685
Would you please
just let me explain?

34:22.768 --> 34:23.518
No, no, I won't.

34:23.603 --> 34:24.478
I hope that you

34:24.562 --> 34:25.980
and your little girlfriend

34:26.063 --> 34:27.940
{\an1}live happily ever after.
Kelly, listen to me--

34:28.024 --> 34:29.484
she is not my girlfriend.

34:29.567 --> 34:31.152
{\an3}Just save it,
all right?

34:31.235 --> 34:32.652
We're over.

34:32.737 --> 34:34.989
Kelly, she's not...

34:49.212 --> 34:50.463
Hey, you got a minute?
No.

34:50.545 --> 34:51.672
{\an1}Make one.

34:51.755 --> 34:52.882
Listen, pal,

34:52.965 --> 34:55.635
{\an3}yesterday got you
more community service.

34:55.717 --> 34:57.887
{\an3}You act up again,
I guarantee you'll go to jail.

34:57.970 --> 35:00.014
That's what I want to talk
to you about-- yesterday.

35:00.097 --> 35:01.224
I was-- that was my fault,

35:01.307 --> 35:03.267
not Ramon's.

35:03.351 --> 35:05.520
{\an3}I'll make sure I mention that
to his probation officer.

35:05.603 --> 35:08.189
{\an1}He's got a family to support.
I got chills.

35:08.272 --> 35:10.900
You should. He works two jobs
and goes to night school.

35:10.983 --> 35:13.528
{\an3}And he has you shilling
for him on the side.

35:13.611 --> 35:15.196
Why don't you stop it.

35:15.279 --> 35:17.323
Just listen to me.

35:19.283 --> 35:21.035
Ten seconds.

35:21.118 --> 35:24.205
I can do it in five--
he's a good man.

35:24.288 --> 35:26.415
He is better than guys
like you and me.

35:29.168 --> 35:31.337
Get to work.

35:37.635 --> 35:40.012
{\an3}Fight for him?
Donna, I broke up with him.

35:40.096 --> 35:40.763
Well, you're angry.

35:40.847 --> 35:42.223
{\an1}You said something
you didn't mean.

35:42.306 --> 35:44.100
Well, he agreed.

35:44.183 --> 35:45.560
I just don't get it.

35:45.643 --> 35:47.562
{\an1}I mean you guys
were doing great.

35:47.645 --> 35:51.148
Well, he didn't have the
courtesy to lie about it.

35:51.232 --> 35:52.400
{\an1}There's got to be
an explanation.

35:52.483 --> 35:53.401
Yeah, I'm a fool.

35:53.484 --> 35:55.903
{\an1}Well, when Dylan came
back, he fought for you.

35:55.987 --> 35:57.572
I think you have
to do the same.

35:57.655 --> 35:59.657
(doorbell ringing)

36:03.286 --> 36:04.745
It's time.

36:04.829 --> 36:06.247
Okay.

36:06.330 --> 36:07.373
Donna, you're leaving me?

36:07.456 --> 36:09.542
I know this is a bad time.

36:09.625 --> 36:11.586
What's on your head?

36:11.669 --> 36:13.754
Green hair.

36:13.838 --> 36:16.424
I'll be back as
soon as I can.

36:34.984 --> 36:37.361
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
no, don't, don't.

36:37.445 --> 36:38.279
Don't throw it.

36:38.362 --> 36:39.947
{\an1}Why not?

36:40.031 --> 36:43.075
{\an3}It's worth saving, bro.
It's a nice shell.

36:43.159 --> 36:44.994
{\an1}80 hours and out,
man, remember?

36:45.077 --> 36:46.996
Saving things isn't part
of the job description.

36:47.079 --> 36:48.664
Yeah, but neither is
taking the blame for something

36:48.748 --> 36:49.832
that wasn't your fault.

36:49.916 --> 36:54.462
Aw, hell, man, I enjoyed
hitting that guy.

36:54.545 --> 36:57.131
(chuckling)
I enjoyed it, too, bro.

36:57.214 --> 36:59.508
I hear it earned
you an extra week.

36:59.592 --> 37:02.637
What about you?

37:02.720 --> 37:04.639
Still 80 and out.

37:04.722 --> 37:06.974
{\an3}And he's being nice,
thanks to you.

37:07.058 --> 37:08.309
Well, it's like you said--

37:08.392 --> 37:10.311
some things are worth saving.

37:10.394 --> 37:13.314
Yeah, some people, too, Dylan.

37:21.197 --> 37:24.033
Ah, keep it simple, right?

37:24.116 --> 37:26.202
{\an1}Right. Her husband had
a heart attack at the club.

37:26.285 --> 37:28.496
{\an3}We tried reviving him, there
was nothing we could do.

37:28.579 --> 37:30.414
{\an1}Oh, what about when she
asks about the body?

37:30.498 --> 37:32.250
Oh, I have no idea.
(knocking)

37:33.709 --> 37:35.294
Yes?

37:35.378 --> 37:36.462
Hi. Mrs. Zaret?

37:36.545 --> 37:38.214
Hi.

37:39.799 --> 37:41.008
We're here...

37:41.092 --> 37:43.844
{\an1}With, uh, uh, news
of your husband.

37:43.928 --> 37:44.804
Is he all right?

37:44.887 --> 37:46.180
I haven't heard from
his since yesterday.

37:46.263 --> 37:49.600
Actually no, he, um...

37:49.684 --> 37:50.893
He had a heart attack.

37:50.977 --> 37:52.603
At our friend's club.

37:52.687 --> 37:56.857
And, uh... he died.

37:56.941 --> 37:59.235
Oh, oh, God, no!

37:59.318 --> 38:00.987
Mrs. Zaret...
I'm so sorry.

38:05.783 --> 38:07.201
Steve.

38:07.284 --> 38:08.244
Yeah.

38:08.327 --> 38:10.037
{\an3}Come on,
come on, come on!

38:10.121 --> 38:12.581
(doorbell ringing)

38:14.625 --> 38:15.835
{\an3}Oh, Dylan, what
do you want?

38:15.918 --> 38:17.378
{\an1}See, I was thinking
that you and I,

38:17.461 --> 38:19.005
{\an1}we need to have
a little understanding.

38:20.297 --> 38:22.341
(sighs)
That's about as understanding

38:22.425 --> 38:24.885
{\an3}as I'm gonna get
right now.

38:24.969 --> 38:26.053
Okay, how about an agreement?

38:26.137 --> 38:27.596
What kind of an agreement?

38:27.680 --> 38:29.432
The kind where we talk
to each other,

38:29.515 --> 38:31.726
and then if that doesn't work,
you can slap me.

38:31.809 --> 38:33.394
Yeah, you go first.

38:33.477 --> 38:35.396
I'm listening.

38:47.158 --> 38:49.285
It's pretty.

38:49.368 --> 38:52.955
Yeah, listen, um, revenge--

38:53.039 --> 38:54.248
{\an1}it's a powerful
thing, Gina.

38:54.331 --> 38:55.166
I didn't know it,

38:55.249 --> 38:57.418
but it will get you up
in the morning,

38:57.501 --> 38:59.045
it will keep you going all day.

38:59.128 --> 39:01.630
{\an1}Throw in drugs,
you're pretty much flying.

39:01.714 --> 39:03.424
Now you take
those two things away

39:03.507 --> 39:06.469
and you're pretty much lost.

39:07.511 --> 39:10.264
I think you'll find your way.

39:10.347 --> 39:12.266
What if I don't?

39:12.349 --> 39:14.310
What if you do?

39:14.393 --> 39:17.438
Now you're working

39:17.521 --> 39:19.690
and you're clean.

39:21.025 --> 39:23.944
You're even getting
a little thoughtful.

39:24.028 --> 39:26.322
Yeah, periodically.

39:26.405 --> 39:27.907
Yeah, just for today, right?

39:29.200 --> 39:31.952
I know you're supposed
to take things

39:32.036 --> 39:33.621
one day at a time right now.

39:33.704 --> 39:37.500
And I don't know, maybe, maybe
this is a little victory.

39:48.260 --> 39:50.304
(rock music playing)

39:52.890 --> 39:55.351
(knocking)

40:01.065 --> 40:04.527
Let me guess, you feel horrible.

40:04.610 --> 40:06.153
I do.

40:06.237 --> 40:07.780
You were on your
way to the movies

40:07.863 --> 40:09.156
{\an3}and something terrible
happened, right?

40:09.240 --> 40:10.658
Yeah.

40:10.741 --> 40:13.160
My mom got into
a car accident.

40:13.244 --> 40:14.829
Hmm.

40:14.912 --> 40:18.499
Was that before or after you
gave me the wrong phone number?

40:18.582 --> 40:20.167
What are you talking about?

40:20.251 --> 40:22.002
The phone number.

40:22.086 --> 40:24.004
I wrote it down.

40:24.088 --> 40:26.882
555-0134.

40:26.966 --> 40:31.178
Yeah, you wrote it down
all right.

40:31.262 --> 40:33.180
You just wrote it wrong.

40:33.264 --> 40:36.934
It's 555-0143.

40:40.229 --> 40:41.522
Oh.

40:44.316 --> 40:45.734
So, how's your mom?

40:45.818 --> 40:49.238
Not good, actually.

40:49.321 --> 40:53.367
I mean, she's gonna be fine,
but she lives alone in Chicago.

40:53.451 --> 40:55.452
I'm flying out
to spend some time with her.

40:55.536 --> 40:58.080
Well, there you go,
disappearing on me.

40:59.290 --> 41:01.000
I brought you something.

41:01.083 --> 41:03.377
The studio turned it down.

41:03.460 --> 41:05.171
They said the ending
wasn't happy enough,

41:05.254 --> 41:07.381
but I think you'll like it.

41:07.464 --> 41:10.301
I'm sure I will.

41:23.147 --> 41:24.064
I knew she didn't die.

41:24.148 --> 41:26.567
{\an5}It was obvious
she just fainted.
Right.

41:26.650 --> 41:28.944
Anyway, she took
the news pretty well.

41:29.028 --> 41:31.238
{\an3}Yeah. She never mentioned
manslaughter once.

41:31.322 --> 41:33.574
Oh! She's here to check
out the crime scene.

41:33.657 --> 41:34.909
Who?

41:34.992 --> 41:36.994
The widow.

41:37.077 --> 41:38.078
Oh, poor thing.

41:38.162 --> 41:39.288
And she's here all alone.

41:39.371 --> 41:41.207
She can make a
citizen's arrest, you know.

41:41.290 --> 41:43.584
She can.

41:43.667 --> 41:45.085
Where are you going?

41:45.169 --> 41:46.587
Donna, Donna!

41:46.670 --> 41:47.671
Hi.

41:47.755 --> 41:48.756
{\an1}Um...

41:48.839 --> 41:50.424
{\an3}we would just like to say...
So, sorry.

41:50.507 --> 41:52.009
...how sorry we are
again for your loss.

41:52.092 --> 41:53.385
I feel terrible,
such a tragedy.

41:53.469 --> 41:55.054
That's okay.

41:55.137 --> 41:57.097
The truth is, Hal's
not a very nice guy.

41:57.181 --> 42:01.977
Still. Anyway, it must
be difficult. I mean...

42:02.061 --> 42:05.231
{\an3}Look like you've seen a ghost.
Hey, guys.

42:05.314 --> 42:08.400
Looks pretty good for a guy
who just got crushed, huh?

42:08.484 --> 42:09.944
{\an1}You son of a bitch.
You set us up.

42:10.027 --> 42:11.237
(cackling)

42:11.320 --> 42:13.447
{\an3}Wait, we hired you
to trick Noah.

42:13.530 --> 42:15.491
{\an1}Yeah, and when I called you
to work out the details,

42:15.574 --> 42:16.575
Noah answered the phone.

42:16.659 --> 42:17.618
He doubled my price.

42:17.701 --> 42:20.746
Next time try
scamming a roommate,

42:20.829 --> 42:22.122
don't give them
your home number.

42:22.206 --> 42:24.541
(laughing)

42:24.625 --> 42:25.501
Drinks on me?

42:25.584 --> 42:26.794
Yeah, why not?

42:26.877 --> 42:29.296
First one is for old Steve.

42:32.383 --> 42:34.301
(laughing)

42:34.385 --> 42:36.637
Drinks are on you.

42:43.727 --> 42:44.812
You're wrong, you know that?

42:44.895 --> 42:46.188
Kelly...

42:46.272 --> 42:47.982
{\an3}About us breaking up
and here's why--

42:48.065 --> 42:50.985
we make each other laugh.

42:51.068 --> 42:53.821
{\an3}We have the same interests.
We have the same taste and...

42:53.904 --> 42:55.489
Thrillers and schmaltzy...
Movies, exactly.

42:55.572 --> 42:57.157
{\an3}And those incredibly
addictive...

42:57.241 --> 42:58.158
Kung fu arcade games.

42:58.242 --> 43:01.161
And air hockey.
Don't forget the air hockey.

43:01.245 --> 43:03.497
Are you agreeing with me?

43:03.580 --> 43:05.374
Yeah, yeah, I am.

43:06.417 --> 43:08.127
What we had was terrific.

43:08.210 --> 43:10.212
What we had.

43:11.588 --> 43:13.799
That's the part
I don't understand, Matt.

43:13.882 --> 43:16.218
If what we had was so good,
then why end it?

43:16.302 --> 43:19.513
Is what you have with what's-
her-name that incredible?

43:19.596 --> 43:21.890
Her name is Lauren.

43:25.561 --> 43:26.854
MATT: Lauren,
this is Kelly.

43:26.937 --> 43:29.857
Kelly, this is Lauren.

43:31.233 --> 43:32.776
She's my wife.
