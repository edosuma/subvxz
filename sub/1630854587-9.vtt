WEBVTT

00:20.208 --> 00:21.041
Perfect.

00:21.125 --> 00:23.166
Just like I planned.

00:24.958 --> 00:26.125
Yes.

00:30.625 --> 00:33.458
I'm a chicken shit.

00:33.541 --> 00:36.958
Oh, thank God I didn't fall.
I could've really gotten hurt.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.875
Ow! Ow! Ow!

00:47.041 --> 00:50.458
Drop anchor
and speed up the paddles for no reason.

00:50.541 --> 00:52.458
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

01:04.541 --> 01:06.500
At least it ended on a fun one.

01:10.250 --> 01:11.666
Why couldn't you just do it?

01:11.750 --> 01:13.375
Oh my God!

01:13.458 --> 01:15.125
I keep forgetting you can talk.

01:15.208 --> 01:20.500
I've tried everything to make you
hit rock bottom and kill yourself.

01:20.583 --> 01:23.375
<i>I reprogrammed your sex doll</i>
<i>so she'd reject you.</i>

01:24.083 --> 01:25.916
<i>I ruined your one chance to get laid</i>

01:26.000 --> 01:28.458
<i>when I sent in</i>
<i>that Venezuelan dick-stinging bee.</i>

01:28.541 --> 01:32.791
<i>I even told you</i>
<i>to expose Gina's clit at that funeral.</i>

01:32.875 --> 01:34.541
<i>That was Miss Whiskers.</i>

01:34.625 --> 01:35.458
<i>Was it?</i>

01:36.375 --> 01:39.541
Mmm! Goddamn!

01:39.625 --> 01:42.208
You talked me into ruining Gina's wedding!

01:42.291 --> 01:44.416
-But the lockets were--
-Photoshopped on!

01:44.500 --> 01:48.000
<i>Then slipped into your dossier</i>
<i>when you were distracted by a…</i>

01:48.083 --> 01:49.958
<i>formal date.</i>

01:50.041 --> 01:51.833
This is a special night.

01:51.916 --> 01:53.875
I've never fucked a dress sock before.

01:53.958 --> 01:56.458
Oh dear.

01:56.541 --> 01:58.208
You ruined my life!

01:58.291 --> 01:59.541
And now I'm gonna end it.

01:59.625 --> 02:01.791
You shot my dad in the balls,

02:01.875 --> 02:05.250
murdering millions
of my sperm brothers and sisters

02:05.333 --> 02:09.041
and leaving me alone
in that withered sack for 15 years!

02:09.125 --> 02:13.375
<i>Ever since I was a fetus,</i>
<i>I've been plotting my revenge.</i>

02:13.458 --> 02:17.000
And now, I'll do to you
what you did to those sperm,

02:17.083 --> 02:20.875
because apparently,
you don't have the balls to kill yourself.

02:20.958 --> 02:23.125
Wait. Y-You can't shoot me.

02:23.208 --> 02:26.833
I-It's… not AFKAK season.
It's duck season.

02:27.833 --> 02:32.166
Fuck you! I mean, I don't know
what's going on here, but fuck you!

02:42.875 --> 02:44.208
Dusty, you gotta help me.

02:44.291 --> 02:45.875
Kevin is trying to kill me.

02:45.958 --> 02:49.750
Kevin James?
Can't you just outwalk that fat sumbitch?

02:49.833 --> 02:52.333
How did I get here?

02:52.416 --> 02:54.125
It's like my whole life went to shit

02:54.208 --> 02:57.791
the day I shot off my dad's balls
when I was five.

02:57.875 --> 02:59.791
AFKAK, no one cares.

02:59.875 --> 03:02.333
Also, you're bumming out Ricky Ricardo.

03:03.208 --> 03:05.000
This insane fat man kidnapped me

03:05.083 --> 03:07.500
and forces me to say my catchphrases!

03:07.583 --> 03:09.375
<i>Gracias.</i>

03:09.458 --> 03:12.500
Dusty, how is Ricky Ricardo
in your apartment? He's dead.

03:12.583 --> 03:16.291
Well, yeah. But I used
my time machine to bring him back.

03:16.375 --> 03:19.208
You know, there's nothing
that puts me in a better mood

03:19.291 --> 03:21.875
than hearing them famous Ricardo-isms.

03:21.958 --> 03:24.666
Now do that weird laugh,
or I'll blow your fucking brains out!

03:24.750 --> 03:27.541
But, Dusty,
then someone will find my body,

03:27.625 --> 03:30.166
and you'll have a lot of 'splainin' to do.

03:30.250 --> 03:33.541
Okay. Okay.

03:33.625 --> 03:36.083
You live another day, Ricky Ricardo.

03:36.166 --> 03:39.208
Dusty, this time machine
is the solution to my problems!

03:39.291 --> 03:40.333
I can use it to go back

03:40.416 --> 03:43.125
and prevent my younger self
from shooting off my dad's balls,

03:43.208 --> 03:44.875
then my life will be perfect!

03:44.958 --> 03:48.791
Uh, b'scuse me? I ain't just gonna
let you use my time machine.

03:48.875 --> 03:51.625
I still gotta go back and stop Bill Cosby.

03:51.708 --> 03:54.208
From making that stupid <i>Fat Albert</i> movie.

03:54.291 --> 03:55.125
How about this.

03:55.208 --> 03:58.708
If you let me borrow the time machine,
I'll bring you back a box of Lucky Charms

03:58.791 --> 04:00.958
from when they didn't have
red-balloon marshmallows

04:01.041 --> 04:02.500
so you won't have to pick them out.

04:02.583 --> 04:07.416
Oh, I do hate them red balloons.
They taste like Hitler's asshole.

04:07.500 --> 04:09.833
How do you know
what Hitler's asshole tastes like?

04:09.916 --> 04:12.541
Duh! I got a time machine, don't I?

04:14.333 --> 04:16.291
So, how does this work?

04:16.375 --> 04:18.041
Does it take into account

04:18.125 --> 04:21.041
the manifold possibilities
laid out in quantum mechanics?

04:21.125 --> 04:25.458
Seriously, Kevin? It's a colander,
a gerbil, and a goddamn Super Nintendo.

04:25.541 --> 04:27.750
We don't gotta
get all <i>Rick and Morty</i> up in here.

04:27.833 --> 04:29.291
But in terms of general relativity--

04:29.375 --> 04:32.708
Kevin! You're confusing our fans.

04:32.791 --> 04:35.000
The audience is high.

04:35.083 --> 04:37.625
The writers are high.

04:37.708 --> 04:42.750
So let's just start
the motherfucking tit-sucking story!

04:44.083 --> 04:47.791
All right. I want to go back to 2004.

04:47.875 --> 04:51.083
You don't know shit
about time travel, do you, numbnuts?

04:51.166 --> 04:53.375
Don't tell me. Tell the gerbil.

04:53.458 --> 04:54.708
Break time's over, bitch!

05:00.666 --> 05:02.500
When he gets back with my time machine,

05:02.583 --> 05:06.750
I'ma go back to 1951
and enslave Ethel and Fred Mertz

05:06.833 --> 05:08.875
so y'all can do whole episodes for me.

05:08.958 --> 05:10.208
What about Lucy?

05:10.291 --> 05:13.208
I'm Lucy. Or at least my pussy is.

05:16.083 --> 05:18.583
Oh, now you'll fucking do it!

05:20.750 --> 05:22.166
Wow! It worked!

05:22.250 --> 05:24.500
Now to prevent myself
from shooting off my dad's balls.

05:24.583 --> 05:27.583
And if there's time, listen
to Michael Jackson albums guilt-free.

05:27.666 --> 05:29.666
Even though, you know, we already knew.

05:29.750 --> 05:30.750
Oh no.

05:31.500 --> 05:32.791
Put down the gun.

05:32.875 --> 05:35.083
What you're about to do
will ruin your life.

05:35.166 --> 05:36.166
Who are you?

05:36.250 --> 05:38.000
I'm you, as an adult.

05:41.250 --> 05:42.250
Aw, shit.

05:42.333 --> 05:45.000
Ten minutes earlier, time gerbil.
Ten minutes earlier.

05:52.458 --> 05:55.208
There. You can't shoot off
someone's balls with a water gun.

05:55.291 --> 05:57.541
Right? Yeah, no. That-- that's right.

06:03.833 --> 06:05.916
Dad, look! I'm a real cop, just like you!

06:06.000 --> 06:06.916
Bang, bang!

06:10.291 --> 06:12.916
Kevin! Stop spraying my balls with--

06:13.000 --> 06:13.958
Oh! Hold on.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.958
That actually feels pretty good.

06:16.041 --> 06:17.166
I did it!

06:17.250 --> 06:19.875
Nothing could wipe this smile off my face.

06:19.958 --> 06:22.666
Little faster, son.
Now aim for that brown spot.

06:23.250 --> 06:25.208
'Kay. I-I think we can leave.

06:25.291 --> 06:28.000
Oh God.
Here comes the tidal wave!

06:28.083 --> 06:29.208
Let's go! Let's go!

06:34.750 --> 06:38.166
Well, I hope not shooting
my dad's balls off changed something.

06:40.416 --> 06:43.791
Whoa. It's like Wakanda with white people!

06:48.625 --> 06:50.583
Excuse me, sir. Where am I?

06:50.666 --> 06:52.791
Well, you in Paradise, silly-willy.

06:52.875 --> 06:53.708
Dusty?

06:53.791 --> 06:57.833
That's five-time
Mr. Universe winner Dusty to you.

06:57.916 --> 06:58.750
Look at this.

07:02.041 --> 07:05.083
Wow, you look incredible!
In that gross kinda way.

07:05.166 --> 07:08.541
I feel incredible in that gross kinda way.

07:08.625 --> 07:10.750
You want your picture taken
'tween my muscle titties?

07:10.833 --> 07:11.666
No, that's--

07:16.541 --> 07:17.750
Good news, guys.

07:17.833 --> 07:21.166
I just came from the doctor,
and she said I have no mental issues.

07:21.250 --> 07:24.500
Which was a weird thing to say
given that I have never had any before.

07:24.583 --> 07:28.041
That's great, Fitz. So I guess
you never banged that dolphin.

07:28.125 --> 07:32.333
Oh, I fucked the shit out of that dolphin.
How you think I got named Man of the Year?

07:35.375 --> 07:37.916
So, Bullet,
why are you walking on all fours?

07:38.000 --> 07:40.291
Uh, dogs can't talk, Kevin.

07:40.375 --> 07:42.875
So he's just a regular happy dog?

07:44.958 --> 07:46.583
Yeah. Look at him.

07:46.666 --> 07:49.333
Running around all unencumbered
by the burdens of human thought

07:49.416 --> 07:50.458
and drug addiction.

07:51.250 --> 07:53.083
Hey! Put that needle down!

07:53.166 --> 07:55.375
Where'd you get that grain alcohol?

07:55.458 --> 07:58.625
And get your nose
out of that poor lady's ass!

08:00.291 --> 08:03.083
Bad Andy Dick!
You're a bad boy, Andy Dick!

08:03.750 --> 08:07.541
Oh, everybody. Here comes
the town's classiest gentlemen!

08:13.333 --> 08:17.000
Well, some things didn't change.
Robby still likes tits.

08:17.083 --> 08:18.625
Oh, that's right, my good man.

08:18.708 --> 08:21.291
TITS. "Ten Inches To Suck."

08:21.375 --> 08:24.000
A reference to my well-endowed husband.

08:25.666 --> 08:28.416
And no one has a problem with that.

08:28.916 --> 08:30.125
You hear that, Florida?

08:30.208 --> 08:31.875
Come along, Dobbert.

08:34.125 --> 08:36.500
I'm so glad our son is attractive.

08:36.583 --> 08:39.541
Could you imagine
if he had rows of jagged teeth,

08:39.625 --> 08:41.958
or one big-ass, weird-looking eyeball?

08:42.041 --> 08:45.583
I cannot. Even though
I am the most celebrated creative writer

08:45.666 --> 08:46.875
of the 21st century.

08:47.625 --> 08:50.541
I bid you farewell.
We're off to see Frank Finger-Fist.

08:50.625 --> 08:52.666
Don't you mean Frank Flipper-Fist?

08:58.166 --> 09:01.583
I love Frank Finger-Fist.

09:01.666 --> 09:03.333
Thanks to advances in finger science,

09:03.416 --> 09:05.666
all he does is play piano
and finger women.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.875
Wow. This world is incredible.

09:10.958 --> 09:13.500
Hey, look.
President Hopson's on television.

09:13.583 --> 09:15.291
<i>My fellow Americans.</i>

09:15.375 --> 09:18.541
The nukes are coming. We're all gonna die!

09:19.625 --> 09:22.333
In three, two, one!

09:23.750 --> 09:25.916
You just got Hopson'd! Eh!

09:28.958 --> 09:31.333
I love that guy.

09:31.416 --> 09:34.291
That's why he has a 100% approval rating.

09:34.375 --> 09:36.458
Well, I guess if Trump can be president…

09:37.291 --> 09:39.791
Donald Trump? He was never president.

09:39.875 --> 09:42.875
Yeah, no, he fell
into the river habitat at the zoo,

09:42.958 --> 09:45.208
and then he got fucked to death by hippos.

09:45.291 --> 09:46.375
Oh my God.

09:46.458 --> 09:48.000
Everything <i>is</i> better here!

09:48.083 --> 09:50.291
I gotta go home
and see what my life is like.

09:50.375 --> 09:52.458
Hold on. I wasn't done.

09:52.541 --> 09:55.458
Them hippos ran a train on Donald,

09:55.541 --> 09:57.666
and hippos shit when they fuck.

09:57.750 --> 10:02.541
So that shit got all in his mouth
like a big ol' hippo shit bukkake.

10:02.625 --> 10:05.500
To make matters worse,
his kids were there watching it.

10:05.583 --> 10:07.083
But they didn't stop it.

10:07.166 --> 10:10.041
They just jumped up and down
and threw confetti.

10:10.125 --> 10:13.541
So now it's a national holiday.
We have a statue to commemorate it.

10:19.791 --> 10:21.333
This place is huge!

10:21.416 --> 10:24.166
My family must work
at Trader Joe's or something!

10:24.250 --> 10:26.458
Kevin! Welcome home!

10:26.541 --> 10:29.416
Wow, Dad? You're in a good mood.

10:29.500 --> 10:31.541
Well, it's hard not to be in a good mood

10:31.625 --> 10:34.416
when you wake up every day
with a full head of hair

10:34.500 --> 10:36.083
and intact balls.

10:36.166 --> 10:37.666
Dad, they're hanging out.

10:37.750 --> 10:39.208
You're welcome.

10:39.291 --> 10:42.416
I got special pants made
so we can all enjoy 'em.

10:42.500 --> 10:43.458
Hey, honey.

10:43.541 --> 10:45.041
Carmen Electra?!

10:45.125 --> 10:46.916
No, Kevin. It's your mother.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.500
Don't you remember?
I got that plastic surgery from Hobo-Doc?

10:50.583 --> 10:51.833
Hobo-Doc?

10:51.916 --> 10:57.000
Hi. I'm Hobo-Doc,
world famous homeless plastic surgeon.

10:57.083 --> 11:00.000
I do one thing, and I do it right.

11:00.083 --> 11:03.666
Make women look like Carmen Electra.

11:03.750 --> 11:05.916
But don't take my word for it.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.250
Don't come to this motherfucker.
He fucked me up!

11:10.583 --> 11:13.000
Another satisfied customer.

11:13.666 --> 11:15.958
You're just in time for dinner, Kevin.

11:16.041 --> 11:18.000
Let's join your brothers and sisters.

11:18.083 --> 11:19.208
Brothers and sisters?

11:19.291 --> 11:21.625
Yeah, brothers and sisters.

11:21.708 --> 11:24.208
What, are you
from a different timeline or something?

11:27.500 --> 11:30.750
They're the quadruplets conceived
the day you squirted that water gun

11:30.833 --> 11:32.333
in your father's asshole.

11:32.416 --> 11:34.041
I came like a wildcat.

11:34.125 --> 11:36.041
Thanks again for that, Kevin.

11:36.125 --> 11:38.583
You remember your world-changing siblings.

11:38.666 --> 11:40.416
Dr. Marie Crawford.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.083
She cured cancer, AIDS,

11:42.166 --> 11:45.291
and whatever the hell
makes Patton Oswalt look like that.

11:45.375 --> 11:47.166
And I invented the condiment clone.

11:47.833 --> 11:49.250
How about a little mustard, sir?

11:49.750 --> 11:50.583
No!

11:50.666 --> 11:53.791
I am God!

11:53.875 --> 11:55.791
Anyway. There's Logan Crawford.

11:55.875 --> 11:58.666
He's saved the planet
by solving global warming.

11:58.750 --> 12:01.541
Once I had cured racism,
global warming was easy.

12:01.625 --> 12:04.666
I had just enough time left over
to win the Olympics.

12:04.750 --> 12:07.500
Acclaimed film director,
Stephen Crawford,

12:07.583 --> 12:10.625
who attained world peace
through his movies.

12:10.708 --> 12:13.708
Surprised me too,
since they all starred James Corden.

12:14.208 --> 12:17.708
And of course
Neil Crawford, who colonized Mars.

12:17.791 --> 12:19.666
<i>I grow potatoes with my poop.</i>

12:19.750 --> 12:22.083
<i>Isn't that right,</i>
<i>alien that I taught to talk?</i>

12:22.166 --> 12:24.541
<i>Take me to your leader.</i>

12:24.625 --> 12:27.833
<i>I'm just kidding. Remember when people</i>
<i>used to think we talked like that?</i>

12:27.916 --> 12:30.250
<i>Back when everyone was fucking racist.</i>

12:30.333 --> 12:32.875
Yep. Those
high-achieving siblings of yours

12:32.958 --> 12:35.416
are the reason this world is so perfect.

12:35.500 --> 12:38.166
They're also in a singing group
called The Crawford Kids.

12:38.250 --> 12:40.375
Their album just hit number one.

12:40.458 --> 12:41.291
Hit it, kids!

12:53.625 --> 12:55.291
Stop! Seriously, stop.

12:55.875 --> 12:58.541
Sorry, I just, uh, really had
the urge to kill myself again.

12:59.166 --> 13:02.250
But, uh, what about me?
Do I have an impressive job?

13:02.333 --> 13:03.333
Of course.

13:03.416 --> 13:06.250
You're the assistant janitor
at Goopy Goobers.

13:06.333 --> 13:07.458
The head janitor says

13:07.541 --> 13:12.375
that pretty soon they might even let you
clean up the poop all by yourself.

13:12.958 --> 13:15.541
No! No! My life sucks here too?

13:15.625 --> 13:19.041
What do you mean, "My life sucks"?
You're married to Gina.

13:19.541 --> 13:20.375
Really?

13:20.458 --> 13:23.458
Yeah. You were
high-school sweethearts, remember?

13:23.541 --> 13:28.333
Kevin, why are you so unaware
of events in this one and only timeline?

13:28.416 --> 13:30.958
So I do have a good life. My plan worked.

13:31.041 --> 13:32.583
I gotta go see my wife.

13:34.083 --> 13:38.333
Hey! Before dinner, who wants
to play a round of Horny Horny Hippos?

13:40.583 --> 13:42.458
Oh! Oh! Oh!

13:42.541 --> 13:44.000
Oh!

13:46.083 --> 13:49.625
<i>Tonight, it's</i>
<i>the Season 8 premiere of </i>Brickleberry<i>,</i>

13:49.708 --> 13:52.791
<i>the Emmy and NAACP Image</i>
<i>award-winning show.</i>

13:52.875 --> 13:56.208
<i>This season,</i>
<i>Malloy hibernates in Connie's vagina.</i>

13:56.291 --> 13:57.708
-I'm home!

13:57.791 --> 13:58.708
Gina!

13:58.791 --> 14:01.291
I'm so happy to see you…

14:01.375 --> 14:02.791
look different.

14:02.875 --> 14:04.458
Why do you have hair like mine?

14:05.458 --> 14:07.333
And boobs smaller than mine.

14:07.416 --> 14:09.791
Well, don't you remember
we agreed to have my boobs removed

14:09.875 --> 14:11.583
so I could be an archer when we LARPed?

14:11.666 --> 14:12.666
Oh, check this out.

14:12.750 --> 14:16.583
I stood in line seven hours to get
this autographed picture of Kevin Smith.

14:16.666 --> 14:19.208
"Dear Gina, sorry about my movies."

14:19.291 --> 14:23.583
But you hate Kevin Smith. You hate anyone
who loses weight after a heart attack.

14:23.666 --> 14:25.250
Oh, don't be silly, Kevin.

14:25.333 --> 14:27.916
Well, if you need me,
I'll be writing my Pokémon fan fiction

14:28.000 --> 14:30.458
where they're all stand-up comics,
called Jokémon.

14:30.541 --> 14:31.958
Mmm. Uh…

14:32.625 --> 14:34.583
Don't you wanna do something more Gina?

14:34.666 --> 14:38.000
Like break someone's ribs
or add to your violent scrapbook.

14:38.083 --> 14:41.833
The only book I care about is my copy
of Gary Gygax's "Deities and Demigods"

14:41.916 --> 14:43.625
with a Cthulhu Mythos included.

14:43.708 --> 14:46.500
Oh! You wanna play D&D?
I'll go get the dice.

14:46.583 --> 14:47.958
Naruto run!

14:48.708 --> 14:49.791
What is happening?

14:50.375 --> 14:51.416
Naruto run!

14:51.500 --> 14:52.958
All right. Ready to play.

14:53.041 --> 14:56.791
Ooh. But first, we need
to do our Monday night routine.

14:56.875 --> 14:57.958
Naruto run!

15:00.416 --> 15:04.208
Don't tell me the three of us are gonna
sing the "Poo Poo Choo Choo" song.

15:04.291 --> 15:05.791
No, silly.

15:05.875 --> 15:06.958
They're gonna sing it too.

15:24.791 --> 15:27.125
Have I always been such a pathetic loser?

15:27.750 --> 15:30.625
Please! Stop! The baby!

15:30.708 --> 15:34.000
-Happy Kevin Sucks Day!

15:41.166 --> 15:42.666
That's it. I am done!

15:42.750 --> 15:45.166
Yay! You get a cookie!

15:45.250 --> 15:46.916
I don't mean pooping!

15:47.000 --> 15:48.583
Although I did poop.

15:49.916 --> 15:51.666
Look what I did to you, Gina.

15:51.750 --> 15:54.375
Being your husband
made you a beta just like me.

15:54.458 --> 15:57.458
Well, I'm not gonna be that guy anymore!

15:59.083 --> 16:01.208
It's time I set things right.

16:01.291 --> 16:04.333
I'm going back to make sure
I shoot my dad in the balls.

16:07.250 --> 16:09.958
That's weird. He left
without saying goodbye to his kids.

16:10.541 --> 16:11.625
Naruto run!

16:11.708 --> 16:13.416
Kamehameha!

16:13.500 --> 16:16.000
I have Patton Oswalt disease.

16:19.875 --> 16:21.666
Drop the water gun, Beta Kevin.

16:21.750 --> 16:23.708
-Who are you?
-I'm Alpha Kevin!

16:23.791 --> 16:27.125
Can't you tell by the missing shirtsleeves
and Sharpie tattoo?

16:29.041 --> 16:30.000
Whoa.

16:30.083 --> 16:33.791
Listen to me. I came here from the future,
and you can't save Dad's balls.

16:33.875 --> 16:37.333
What are you talking about? If I don't,
I'll never have a perfect life.

16:37.416 --> 16:40.666
I've already lived that life,
and it's anything but perfect.

16:40.750 --> 16:41.833
You're married to Gina,

16:41.916 --> 16:46.333
and all she wants to do is play D&D,
read comics, and Naruto run everywhere.

16:46.916 --> 16:50.166
I don't understand. Is-- is she fat?

16:50.250 --> 16:53.958
-Rawr.

16:54.041 --> 16:55.291
Oh no. We don't have much time

16:55.375 --> 16:57.708
until past us walks in
and shoots Dad's nuts.

16:57.791 --> 16:59.666
Mom and Dad are gonna have sex soon.

16:59.750 --> 17:00.583
How do you know?

17:00.666 --> 17:03.208
Because we both know
their foreplay is always the same.

17:03.291 --> 17:04.750
And they are at stage one!

17:04.833 --> 17:07.125
Super-realistic role-playing!

17:07.208 --> 17:10.166
Yeah,
I see the problem. Your coolant is low.

17:10.250 --> 17:12.291
Randall, do we have to do all this?

17:12.375 --> 17:17.166
I'm not Randall.
I'm Felipé, the Australian AC guy.

17:17.250 --> 17:19.458
And you hired me to do a job, 'member?

17:19.541 --> 17:20.875
Oh, well in that case,

17:20.958 --> 17:24.541
maybe there's another job
I could give you.

17:24.625 --> 17:29.125
What are you, crazy?
I can't risk my job for sex with a client!

17:29.208 --> 17:32.000
I got a kid with Patton Oswalt disease.

17:32.083 --> 17:34.000
Those balls have to go.

17:34.083 --> 17:35.208
No!

17:35.291 --> 17:37.375
We don't have time for this!

17:37.458 --> 17:39.708
Dad's already
at the second stage of foreplay!

17:39.791 --> 17:43.208
Antagonizing a cardboard cutout
to assert male dominance!

17:43.291 --> 17:46.833
Listen here, Jerry O'Connell.
Did you eye-fuck my wife?

17:48.375 --> 17:50.958
Okay, O'Connell. Okay, I give up!

17:52.291 --> 17:54.958
I won't let you send me back
to my shitty life!

17:58.000 --> 18:01.958
The only reason you have a shitty life
is that you're a pussy!

18:02.041 --> 18:02.958
Look at you.

18:03.041 --> 18:06.458
You let a group of sex dolls
kick you out of your apartment.

18:06.541 --> 18:08.958
You let your father
take away your own name!

18:09.041 --> 18:11.625
You never stand up for yourself!

18:11.708 --> 18:13.666
But I'm a victim.

18:13.750 --> 18:16.000
-No. You're the problem.

18:16.083 --> 18:19.416
And my little brother said
I didn't have the balls to kill myself.

18:26.791 --> 18:29.083
My nut! You shot me in my nut!

18:33.000 --> 18:34.916
Perfect. It's like I was never here.

18:35.750 --> 18:38.416
Oh right. I better hide this body
where no one will find it.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.333
Here we go. No one ever uses this crap.

18:42.958 --> 18:47.041
Kid, if you think this will fuck you up,
wait till Coach Russo gets ahold of you.

18:49.833 --> 18:52.125
Please, let everything be back to normal.

18:56.291 --> 18:59.041
Bullet! You're a drug addict!

18:59.125 --> 19:00.333
Hey, fuck you!

19:00.416 --> 19:03.666
-Fitz! You have mental problems!

19:03.750 --> 19:05.500
Hey! Fuck you!

19:06.958 --> 19:09.333
Hobo-Cop, you're not a doctor.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.958
I know. I'm an astronaut.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.708
Look at me!
I'm trying to get a role on <i>Farzar</i>!

19:17.791 --> 19:20.416
Uh, this-- this show is a sinking ship.

19:22.500 --> 19:24.750
So you put everything back to normal?

19:24.833 --> 19:26.833
That other reality must have been awful.

19:26.916 --> 19:30.541
Probably full of cancer
and racism and no <i>Brickleberry</i>.

19:30.625 --> 19:31.750
What was I like?

19:31.833 --> 19:32.666
Uh…

19:32.750 --> 19:36.750
You were fatter. And-- and homeless.
And you had a wallet chain.

19:36.833 --> 19:38.416
Oh, that's my nightmare.

19:38.500 --> 19:41.500
Bless you, Kevin,
for your noble, heroic deed.

19:41.583 --> 19:44.375
Well, it's time for me
to take my life back.

19:44.458 --> 19:46.458
I guess I won't be needing this anymore.

19:47.666 --> 19:52.500
Kevin, you stupid sumbitch!
That was a fully functioning time machine!

19:52.583 --> 19:54.833
I got you the Lucky Charms
with no red balloons.

19:54.916 --> 19:56.375
I am appeased.

19:58.958 --> 20:00.375
All right! Everyone out.

20:00.458 --> 20:02.958
Or the next thing
inside you will be my fist!

20:03.041 --> 20:05.583
And not in a sexual way.

20:06.791 --> 20:10.000
Oh! Now you can move.

20:11.166 --> 20:13.916
What are you doing here, AFKAK?

20:16.000 --> 20:18.500
My name is Kevin!

20:18.583 --> 20:20.625
Say it! Say my name.

20:20.708 --> 20:23.000
Kevin! Your name is Kevin!

20:23.083 --> 20:25.375
Jesus, that was intense.

20:25.458 --> 20:30.166
I need to relax with some fancy tea
and the rarely used good china.

20:32.458 --> 20:34.041
What the fuck?!

20:34.125 --> 20:37.791
No! Get it off me! Get it off!
Help! I'm trapped inside it!

20:38.791 --> 20:40.125
There's nowhere to run.

20:40.833 --> 20:42.208
I'm not running this time.

20:42.291 --> 20:44.375
You were right. I did suck.

20:44.458 --> 20:46.333
-But I'm not that guy anymore.

20:46.416 --> 20:48.666
And now you're gonna respect me.

20:48.750 --> 20:50.833
And you can start by thanking me.

20:50.916 --> 20:54.750
Because I went back in time and found out
that if I hadn't shot Dad's balls off,

20:54.833 --> 20:56.416
you would have never been born.

20:56.500 --> 20:59.875
Or worse.
You would have been born as one of these.

21:08.791 --> 21:11.166
It's okay. They can't hurt you now.

21:11.250 --> 21:15.041
Thank you, Kevin. For not letting me
be one of those singing fuck faces.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.750
Kevin! We gotta get out of town now!

21:19.333 --> 21:21.166
Norf! I thought you were dead!

21:21.250 --> 21:22.333
So did the guards.

21:22.416 --> 21:24.833
See, my pulse is extremely shallow

21:24.916 --> 21:27.458
because I have the metabolism
of a large turtle.

21:27.541 --> 21:29.500
Yeah. Before they dumped me in a ditch,

21:29.583 --> 21:31.916
I overheard
what Charles Lovely is planning,

21:32.000 --> 21:33.708
and we've gotta leave before he--

21:38.416 --> 21:42.666
<i>-The Eternal Reckoning has begun.</i>

21:55.333 --> 21:58.875
<i>Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.</i>

21:58.958 --> 22:00.250
<i>Let me have a go, boss.</i>

22:09.000 --> 22:11.541
What the hell is a eternal reckoning?

22:12.375 --> 22:16.000
Sounds like Charles Lovely's
got a lot of 'splainin' to do.

22:16.083 --> 22:18.833
-Grab that Ricky! He's escaped!

22:18.916 --> 22:20.791
Naruto run!
