00:08.289 --> 00:11.771
like you don't really want
me to know who you are.

00:11.773 --> 00:14.406
JASON: <i>If I focus on what
happened between me and Alana</i>

00:14.408 --> 00:18.186
and how that ended, how is
that gonna help me with Natalie?

00:18.188 --> 00:20.079
If it keeps you from
ever opening yourself up

00:20.081 --> 00:23.148
to somebody again, brother,
that's a damn tragedy.

00:25.252 --> 00:26.652
- (JASON MUTTERING)
- NATALIE: Uh-uh, no.

00:26.654 --> 00:28.320
- No. No. What? No, no.
- No, he's terrifying.

00:28.322 --> 00:29.652
- He's not terrifying.
- He's terrifying.

00:29.654 --> 00:31.374
And all he wants is to
be in front of the camera.

00:31.376 --> 00:33.516
- He just... he wants attention all the time.
- He wants attention.

00:33.518 --> 00:35.595
What's wrong with that? I mean,
you cannot criticize Gritty.

00:35.597 --> 00:37.985
You understand me? There is
nobody who can criticize Gritty

00:37.987 --> 00:39.329
- except the people in Philadelphia.
- Why is that?

00:39.331 --> 00:40.899
- Oh, oh, okay.
- And even the people in Philadelphia

00:40.901 --> 00:42.993
- that criticize him... they get a pie in the face.
- Oh, of course.

00:42.995 --> 00:44.470
Because the people from Philadelphia

00:44.472 --> 00:46.438
are the people who brought
us the big green Phanatic.

00:46.440 --> 00:48.192
- What's wrong with him?
- I mean, there's some sort

00:48.194 --> 00:50.587
of, like, Muppet fetish
with people from Philly.

00:50.589 --> 00:51.765
- What is it?
- Ah, the Muppets fetish.

00:51.767 --> 00:53.579
Lot of hair, it's a lot of fuzz.
All right, don't even talk.

00:53.581 --> 00:55.013
I don't want to hear
about you and, what,

00:55.015 --> 00:56.171
your Wisconsin Badgers?

00:56.173 --> 00:57.799
What is that guy? Bucky the Badger?

00:57.801 --> 00:59.491
He's like a four-year-old
with bad teeth.

00:59.493 --> 01:01.253
- "Oh, okay, I'm Bucky Badger".
- Don't go there.

01:01.255 --> 01:03.551
- Do not go there. Bucky is sacred.
- "Oh, oh, oh, oh".

01:03.553 --> 01:04.789
- Oh, okay.
- That hurts.

01:04.791 --> 01:05.914
Okay, tell you what. You know what?

01:05.916 --> 01:08.293
You keep hitting me with
all these little remarks,

01:08.295 --> 01:09.995
I'm not gonna take you
camping this weekend, so...

01:09.997 --> 01:11.029
Oh, is that a promise?

01:11.031 --> 01:12.587
- Yeah, it is a promise. Come on.
- Hmm?

01:12.589 --> 01:14.633
Aren't you looking forward
to the great outdoors?

01:14.635 --> 01:17.783
We could go to a great
bed-and-breakfast instead

01:17.785 --> 01:18.904
and have... I don't know...

01:18.906 --> 01:21.191
- plumbing and mattresses.
- Ah, feel that? You feel that?

01:21.193 --> 01:23.274
California's getting you
soft, like, soft as a grape.

01:23.276 --> 01:24.675
Soft as a grape. My kids...

01:24.677 --> 01:26.444
they love this camping spot I went to.

01:26.446 --> 01:28.779
Well, I'm sure that I will love it, too.

01:35.294 --> 01:36.798
- You cut me off!
- What, are you blind?

01:36.800 --> 01:37.955
You cut me off!

- Watch where you're going, man.
- Yeah. Let's go. Come on.

01:43.996 --> 01:48.032
Oh. Thank you for
saving me from that guy.

01:48.034 --> 01:51.135
He was, like, droning on
and on about the tax benefits

01:51.137 --> 01:53.671
of investing in gigabyte
opportunity zones.

01:55.141 --> 01:59.410
Hey, isn't Senator
Walters attending your,

01:59.412 --> 02:01.838
uh, dog-and-pony show tomorrow?

02:01.840 --> 02:04.876
Yeah. Yeah, he chairs the
Appropriations Committee.

02:04.878 --> 02:06.787
Controls DEVGRU's allowance.

02:06.789 --> 02:10.020
That's his aide over by the bar.

02:10.021 --> 02:12.823

02:37.049 --> 02:38.739
I mean, come on. I-I knew
that politics were dirty,

02:38.741 --> 02:40.584

02:51.529 --> 02:54.740

Petty Officer Spenser here
is the prime example of

09:16.848 --> 09:18.473
our new generation
of SEALS who are ready

09:18.475 --> 09:19.507
to lead this nation

09:19.509 --> 09:21.642
into the next decade.

09:21.644 --> 09:25.413
And those who don't
evolve will be left behind.

09:28.184 --> 09:31.486
(SEALS SHOUTING ORDERS INDISTINCTLY)

09:31.488 --> 09:34.355
Hold up. Wait a minute.

09:34.357 --> 09:36.090
How can you say they won't like you?

09:36.092 --> 09:38.426
You haven't even met the
kids at your new school yet.

09:38.428 --> 09:41.529
But what if I meet them
and they don't like me?

09:41.531 --> 09:43.297
Well, you've got to give 'em a chance

09:43.299 --> 09:44.599
to get to know you first.

09:44.601 --> 09:46.210
Just like they're
gonna give you a chance.

09:46.212 --> 09:48.269
Once they see how nice you are,
they're gonna be nice to you.

09:48.271 --> 09:49.882
REPORTER (OVER TV): ... in
response to Marsden taking sides

09:49.884 --> 09:50.971
with the Hashid.

09:50.973 --> 09:53.499
The surprising allegations
that the late ambassador

09:53.501 --> 09:55.714
may have not only
mishandled the peace talks

09:55.716 --> 09:57.875
but that she may also
have been responsible

09:57.877 --> 09:59.309
- for the recent attack...
- Daddy?

09:59.311 --> 10:00.480
Yeah, babe?

10:00.482 --> 10:01.981
What's the matter?

10:03.285 --> 10:05.552
Oh, well, I worked with that lady,

10:05.554 --> 10:08.321
the ambassador, before she died.

10:08.323 --> 10:10.624
She was a real good person,
but somebody's trying to say

10:10.626 --> 10:12.459
she failed at her job.

10:12.461 --> 10:15.529
That's just not true.

10:15.531 --> 10:17.397
How do you know?

10:17.399 --> 10:20.567
I was there.

10:20.569 --> 10:23.537
Is that what your job's like?

10:25.340 --> 10:27.674
Do people shoot at you?

10:29.378 --> 10:32.478
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Daddy's
a sailor, baby girl.

10:32.480 --> 10:34.146
(TURNS OFF TV)

10:34.148 --> 10:35.714
Now, go wash up... (CLEARS THROAT)

10:35.716 --> 10:37.916
before your mom gets
home, starts yelling at me.

10:42.711 --> 10:44.433
(SIGHS)

10:44.435 --> 10:47.526
CONNERS: So, what is it
that you're afraid of, Jason?

10:47.528 --> 10:50.496
What makes you think I'm afraid?
I'm not afraid of anything.

10:50.498 --> 10:52.364
Well, the fact that you're
sitting across from me

10:52.366 --> 10:53.932
for the first time in months.

10:55.169 --> 10:56.735
I'm fine.

10:56.737 --> 10:58.237
Actually, I'm doing really good.

10:58.239 --> 11:00.389
Me and Natalie, we're
going camping this weekend,

11:00.391 --> 11:02.408
- and it's gonna be smooth, Doc.
- That's great.

11:02.410 --> 11:04.336
- Yeah.
- Yeah, so you-you two are making progress.

11:04.338 --> 11:05.343
Sure.

11:05.345 --> 11:07.580
I-I'm trying to, uh...

11:07.582 --> 11:10.882
do what you told me
to do, and that's, um,

11:10.884 --> 11:13.451
break down my inner wall. (LAUGHS)

11:13.453 --> 11:15.053
But, uh, it's, uh...

11:15.055 --> 11:18.056
- You know.
- It's-it's scary letting someone in.

11:18.058 --> 11:20.225
Are you... are you feeling exposed?

11:20.227 --> 11:23.561
Yeah, I feel exposed.

11:23.563 --> 11:25.897
Yeah, like I'm in the crosshairs.

11:25.899 --> 11:27.432
Tell you, sometimes,

11:27.434 --> 11:29.735
I wish I was on the
other end of the scope.

11:29.737 --> 11:31.703
- S-See? (EXHALES)
- Hmm.

11:31.705 --> 11:34.706
You know, Natalie helped put you
back together after your injury.

11:34.708 --> 11:37.010
- Yeah.
- She saw you at your lowest

11:37.012 --> 11:38.744
and still got involved with you.

11:38.746 --> 11:43.115
She told me, "Fix the body,
and the mind will follow".

11:43.117 --> 11:45.618
Well, you know what?
Body's 100%. But the mind?

11:45.620 --> 11:47.051
She still, uh...

11:47.053 --> 11:49.387
She's still seeing the cracks
in your invincible persona.

11:49.389 --> 11:52.557
You know, opening up means
revealing the impact of all

11:52.559 --> 11:54.726
the trauma that you've endured, Jason.

11:54.728 --> 11:56.160
- All of it.
- Yeah.

11:56.162 --> 11:58.940
So, is that... is that
maybe what has you worried?

11:58.942 --> 12:00.231
It's a lot.

12:00.233 --> 12:01.999
It's a lot for her to handle.

12:02.001 --> 12:03.941
Look, you know what?

12:03.943 --> 12:05.488
My team's deploying next month.

12:05.490 --> 12:07.739
We're deploying, so I
got to focus on them.

12:07.741 --> 12:10.174
But-but Natalie, she
works with SEALs, right?

12:10.176 --> 12:11.576
Yeah, she works with SEALs.

12:11.578 --> 12:13.232
So saying her position

12:13.234 --> 12:15.018
would give her intimate knowledge

12:15.020 --> 12:16.916
of both the physical and mental damage

12:16.918 --> 12:18.483
that combat causes.

12:20.109 --> 12:22.465
Right?

12:22.467 --> 12:25.942
(CHUCKLES): Well, working
together and dating

12:25.944 --> 12:27.576
- are two separate things, Doc.
- You know, I don't think

12:27.578 --> 12:29.016
it's like she thought
she was getting into

12:29.018 --> 12:30.378
a relationship with an accountant.

12:32.308 --> 12:34.298
- Natalie had the goods on you.
- Yes.

12:34.300 --> 12:36.914
- Warts and all, and she still took the plunge.
- Took the plunge.

12:36.916 --> 12:39.003
So I don't think you should
tell me that you're shielding her

12:39.005 --> 12:40.493
from anything, 'cause
you and I both know

12:40.495 --> 12:42.352
that she is strong enough to handle it.

12:42.354 --> 12:45.132
- Hmm?
- She's strong enough to handle it.

12:45.134 --> 12:46.555
So, what is it really

12:46.557 --> 12:48.797
- that has you putting your walls back up?
- Stop with the walls.

12:48.799 --> 12:51.648
- Stop with the walls.
- Faced with some adversity,

12:51.650 --> 12:54.651
and you're choosing flight over fight.

12:54.653 --> 12:56.787
Why?

12:56.789 --> 13:00.457
Do you think that
there's choice in duty?

13:00.459 --> 13:01.915
Yeah?

13:01.917 --> 13:04.194
My men and my mission come first.

13:04.196 --> 13:06.229
My men and my mission come first.

13:06.231 --> 13:08.602
I think that's a great recipe

13:08.604 --> 13:09.844
for a mature relationship.

13:09.846 --> 13:11.919
It's how I keep my team safe, Doc, okay?

13:11.921 --> 13:13.171
It's how I keep them safe.

13:13.173 --> 13:14.504
What is it that you want, Jason?

13:14.506 --> 13:16.630
- I want? What I want.
- What is it that you want?

13:16.632 --> 13:18.575
I want to bring my men home.

13:18.577 --> 13:21.244
I want to make sure
that my men come home.

13:21.246 --> 13:22.879
I think that's what Bravo 1 wants.

13:22.881 --> 13:25.716
Stop with the Bravo 1
crap already, all right?

13:25.718 --> 13:27.917
All right. Intimacy,

13:27.919 --> 13:30.754
both emotional and physical,

13:30.756 --> 13:34.374
it requires a deeper, better
understanding of the self

13:34.376 --> 13:36.608
before it can be shared
with somebody else.

13:36.610 --> 13:38.617
I don't even know what
the hell that means.

13:38.619 --> 13:39.662
- (PHONE BUZZING)
- I don't know what that means.

13:39.664 --> 13:41.464
I don't know what you're
talking about. I really don't.

13:41.466 --> 13:43.460
I'm just saying that Bravo
1, the great protector,

13:43.462 --> 13:45.835
knows what's best for
everyone but himself.

13:45.837 --> 13:48.571
You know what? Time's up. Yeah.

13:48.573 --> 13:50.105
Niger is a developing country,

13:50.107 --> 13:52.608
but it ranks last on the
UN's Human Development list

13:52.610 --> 13:55.037
despite being ripe
with natural resources.

13:55.039 --> 13:56.594
ERIC: Those resources make it

13:56.596 --> 13:58.527
an important piece on
the global chessboard.

13:58.529 --> 14:00.769
The entire region is a strategic hotbed.

14:00.771 --> 14:03.367
Local forces and international
powers like Russia

14:03.369 --> 14:05.336
and China are all vying for control.

14:05.338 --> 14:07.356
Well, last I heard, China
had boots on the ground.

14:07.358 --> 14:09.436
Yeah, they built a, uh, naval base

14:09.438 --> 14:11.720
- in 2017 in Djibouti, right?
- DAVIS: Correct.

14:11.722 --> 14:13.852
And Russia wants to
get in on the fun, too.

14:13.854 --> 14:16.215
MANDY: Russian private
military companies are arming,

14:16.217 --> 14:18.649
training and supporting local forces.

14:18.651 --> 14:20.035
With the Russians arming everyone,

14:20.037 --> 14:21.703
how does the U.S. compete in Niger?

14:21.705 --> 14:23.038
World power expresses itself

14:23.040 --> 14:25.086
in military might or infrastructure.

14:25.088 --> 14:28.265
The U.S. is helping rebuild
Niger's outdated infrastructure.

14:28.267 --> 14:30.212
The Army Corps of
Engineers is already working

14:30.214 --> 14:32.650
on several projects, including a dam

14:32.652 --> 14:34.326
and major thoroughfare.

14:34.328 --> 14:36.335
Bravo has been tasked with surveilling

14:36.337 --> 14:38.475
a Boko Haram camp in the area.

14:38.477 --> 14:40.700
This particular BH faction

14:40.702 --> 14:42.756
has executed aide workers,

14:42.758 --> 14:45.447
orchestrated suicide bombings
and just last month

14:45.449 --> 14:48.022
abducted 110 schoolgirls.

14:48.024 --> 14:49.463
JASON: Well, Boko's been
acting out for years.

14:49.465 --> 14:50.831
Why are we surveilling them

14:50.833 --> 14:52.833
when we have plenty of
reason to strike here?

14:52.835 --> 14:55.502
You're looking for a
former Spetsnaz commander,

14:55.504 --> 14:57.305
Vadik Petrov.

14:57.307 --> 15:00.045
He's now working with a
Russian contracting firm

15:00.047 --> 15:02.326
suspected of supplying local forces

15:02.328 --> 15:03.666
against American interests.

15:03.668 --> 15:05.491
Intel says that Petrov is set to arrive

15:05.493 --> 15:07.114
at the Boko camp in the next two days.

15:07.116 --> 15:08.932
Bravo's job is to confirm

15:08.934 --> 15:11.392
Petrov's association with Boko Haram

15:11.394 --> 15:14.105
and see what other groups in
the area he is working with.

15:14.107 --> 15:15.221
Special recon.

15:15.223 --> 15:16.589
SONNY: So, we're gonna trek

15:16.591 --> 15:18.791
into this death jungle and track down

15:18.793 --> 15:20.377
this Commie contractor?

15:20.379 --> 15:21.719
What are the rules of engagement?

15:21.721 --> 15:23.551
Niger's a semi-permissive environment.

15:23.553 --> 15:25.282
No firing unless fired upon.

15:25.284 --> 15:27.367
Oh, it's always fun heading
into the battlefield handcuffed,

15:27.369 --> 15:28.969
isn't it, boys? Hmm?

15:38.721 --> 15:39.887
Hey.

15:39.889 --> 15:42.256
- Hey, hey.
- Hey, hey. Hey.

15:42.258 --> 15:43.557
- Hey, everything all right?
- Yeah.

15:43.559 --> 15:45.025
You blew out so fast this morning,

15:45.027 --> 15:46.517
- I didn't have a chance to check on you.
- Oh, you know,

15:46.519 --> 15:48.565
I just really wasn't myself
last night. That's all.

15:48.567 --> 15:51.802
You were until you weren't.

15:52.895 --> 15:55.152
Look, I've seen a lot in
my time with the teams,

15:55.154 --> 15:56.943
if there's anything
you want to talk about.

15:56.945 --> 15:59.507
Didn't get much sleep
last night. That's all.

15:59.509 --> 16:01.677
Well, hopefully, you'll
sleep better this weekend

16:01.679 --> 16:03.026
- under the stars.
- Right.

16:03.028 --> 16:04.383
Well, you know what?
We're spinning up now,

16:04.385 --> 16:06.913
and, uh, you know, with deployment, uh,

16:06.915 --> 16:09.539
coming up, I just, uh, I
think the camping thing just...

16:09.541 --> 16:11.250
has to wait. Got to
put it on hold for now.

16:11.252 --> 16:13.753
- You know, I got to focus on Bravo.
- Really?

16:13.755 --> 16:16.197
I was really looking
forward to some away time.

16:16.199 --> 16:18.366
Me, too. Yeah, I'm
sorry. I'm really sorry.

16:18.368 --> 16:20.668
But I got a plane to catch,
you know? (CLICKS TONGUE)

16:20.670 --> 16:22.070
Be safe.

16:22.072 --> 16:23.404
Yeah.

16:33.415 --> 16:35.415
- (WHISTLES)
- Aah!

16:35.417 --> 16:38.085
(CHUCKLES): Ah. Ensign Davis.

16:38.087 --> 16:41.388
To what do I owe this pleasure?

16:41.390 --> 16:44.691
Hmm. Well, heard about the bar.

16:44.693 --> 16:47.638
Little, uh, "stolen valor" altercation.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.261
"Altercation"? Come on, man.

16:49.263 --> 16:50.597
It was more like a little dustup.

16:50.599 --> 16:52.897
Okay, well, I've seen you
with those guys plenty of times

16:52.899 --> 16:54.601
when there wasn't even a little dustup,

16:54.603 --> 16:57.081
so what made you decide
to throw hands this time?

16:57.083 --> 16:59.209
Okay. Well, fellow just
needed to be reminded

16:59.211 --> 17:00.540
his place on the food chain.

17:00.542 --> 17:02.109
Sonny, you know better than I do

17:02.111 --> 17:03.710
that the toughest guy at the bar

17:03.712 --> 17:05.412
doesn't worry about proving it.

17:05.414 --> 17:06.878
Okay.

17:06.881 --> 17:10.215
Well, I wouldn't have
had to if Clay had, uh,

17:10.218 --> 17:12.818
you know, stood up to
him in the first place.

17:12.819 --> 17:14.720
Yeah, but I guess us door kickers

17:14.722 --> 17:16.922
don't really mean much anymore to him

17:16.924 --> 17:20.086
since he's rubbing elbows
with you movers and shakers.

17:20.088 --> 17:21.150
Sonny.

17:21.152 --> 17:23.152
Okay, okay, okay.

17:25.233 --> 17:27.424
Davis, I promise

17:27.425 --> 17:30.545
not to get in any more
dustups or altercations,

17:30.547 --> 17:33.571
and I will keep my hands

17:33.573 --> 17:35.608
to myself in the future.

17:35.610 --> 17:37.109
Unless...

17:37.111 --> 17:40.108
Unless I'm sticking
dollar bills in a G-string.

17:40.110 --> 17:42.314
- Okay, all right. Good talk.
- 'Cause I'm badass. Bam!

17:42.316 --> 17:46.043
- Good talk, friend.
- (LAUGHS)

17:46.045 --> 17:49.045
_

17:50.257 --> 17:51.956
12 mikes out.

17:51.958 --> 17:54.592
- Should be a gravel road in about a mile.
- Copy.

17:56.240 --> 17:57.962
Y'all see the news?

17:57.964 --> 17:59.597
About Marsden?

17:59.599 --> 18:01.499
RAY: Straight-up ugly, man.

18:01.501 --> 18:03.191
State Department's
throwing her under the bus.

18:03.193 --> 18:04.848
It's a straight-up snow job, I mean...

18:04.850 --> 18:07.272

softened up by yours truly.

30:43.161 --> 30:44.894
Texas, one.

30:44.896 --> 30:48.415
Boko Haram, zero.

30:48.417 --> 30:49.739
That's a good call, 4.

30:49.741 --> 30:52.168
Okay, let's pick up the
scraps and head home.

30:52.170 --> 30:54.771
PILOT: Refueling complete.

30:54.773 --> 30:57.674
Yeah, bring it over, buddy.

30:57.676 --> 31:01.945
I just can't remember the last
time we came up against a tank.

31:01.947 --> 31:03.580
- (LAUGHS)
- You know? (CHUCKLES)

31:03.582 --> 31:06.182
That was some quick
thinking, drawing their fire.

31:06.184 --> 31:08.118
- Old Glory always comes through, right?
- Yeah, let me cheers that.

31:08.120 --> 31:09.686
- Boom.
- That's right.

31:11.290 --> 31:13.056
Fearless stuff.

31:13.058 --> 31:14.891
Also reckless as hell.

31:14.893 --> 31:17.293
Yeah, reckless. That's for sure.

31:17.295 --> 31:20.025
Tell you what, they get any closer,

31:20.027 --> 31:23.133
I'm not sure any one
of us is coming home.

31:23.135 --> 31:25.568
I appreciate that.

31:25.570 --> 31:27.971
Especially now that, uh,

31:27.973 --> 31:30.006
Jameelah's starting to ask questions.

31:30.008 --> 31:31.263
Mm.

31:31.265 --> 31:32.620
You know, the kind wondering

31:32.622 --> 31:34.110
if I'm always gonna make the flight home

31:34.112 --> 31:36.279
from the battlefield.

31:36.281 --> 31:37.814
Mm.

31:37.816 --> 31:39.979
That age, huh? She's asking questions.

31:39.981 --> 31:41.951
- It's tough.
- Yeah.

31:41.953 --> 31:44.120
How'd you tell Emma and Mikey?

31:44.122 --> 31:47.657
I didn't. Uh, Alana, she
took care of all that.

31:47.659 --> 31:49.898
You know, I definitely
understand the desire

31:49.900 --> 31:51.394
not to want to get that real with them.

31:51.396 --> 31:55.264
'Cause, at this point... (SIGHS)

31:55.266 --> 31:58.100
best answer I got for Jameelah is,

31:58.102 --> 31:59.735
"Daddy's a sailor, honey".

31:59.737 --> 32:01.437
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

32:01.439 --> 32:03.673
My kids, they knew that I was a SEAL.

32:03.675 --> 32:07.430
I just... didn't tell 'em the details.

32:07.432 --> 32:10.199
'Cause I just didn't want them
to think bad of me, you know?

32:10.201 --> 32:11.947
You know what? Just...

32:11.949 --> 32:14.209
leave out the details
with your little girl.

32:14.211 --> 32:16.044
That's all.

32:18.155 --> 32:19.755
Maybe you're right.

(CLEARS THROAT)

32:20.958 --> 32:22.358
(EXHALES)

32:22.360 --> 32:24.794
Still, the people we love deserve to...

32:24.796 --> 32:26.429
to know us, right?

32:28.032 --> 32:31.099
- Hmm?
- Just got to trust that they'll, uh...

32:31.101 --> 32:33.101
understand.

32:36.473 --> 32:38.873

32:43.994 --> 32:45.450
You wanted to see me, sir?

32:45.452 --> 32:47.281
Some fine work with the
senators the other day.

32:47.283 --> 32:48.828
Relax, Spenser.

32:48.830 --> 32:51.888
Your, uh, interactive demonstration

32:51.890 --> 32:53.822
kept the tour from being a bust.

32:53.824 --> 32:56.290
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

32:57.327 --> 32:59.661
So, you, uh... (SNIFFS)

32:59.663 --> 33:01.740
Well, you continue to
impress me, Spenser.

33:01.742 --> 33:04.566
Your suggestion the other morning,

33:04.568 --> 33:06.834
the BV for your actions in Yemen.

33:06.836 --> 33:09.636
So, when I first got here,

33:09.638 --> 33:11.138
you were making waves.

33:11.140 --> 33:13.340
I told you to stand
down on the TBI issue,

33:13.342 --> 33:17.544
in part to keep you from
tanking your own career.

33:18.848 --> 33:20.981
Well, I've since come to learn that...

33:20.983 --> 33:22.850
making waves is your strength.

33:22.852 --> 33:24.852
(CHUCKLES)

33:24.854 --> 33:27.661
I mean, thank you, sir.

33:27.663 --> 33:29.720
You given any thought to
our talk the other day?

33:29.722 --> 33:31.825
What kind of career
path you'd like to take?

33:31.827 --> 33:35.752
I've always just figured
I'd lead my own team one day.

33:35.754 --> 33:39.788
You ever considered anything
beyond kicking doors?

33:39.790 --> 33:43.370
You'd be an outstanding
candidate for STA-21.

33:43.372 --> 33:45.105
Seaman to Admiral?

33:45.107 --> 33:47.374
Yeah, we need good people
at the top, Spenser.

33:47.376 --> 33:49.334
And being an admiral would
give you the kind of influence

33:49.336 --> 33:51.176
it takes to make a real difference

33:51.178 --> 33:52.578
in a lot of areas.

33:55.450 --> 33:58.718
I never really thought about it before.

33:58.720 --> 34:02.087
Well, you should. (CLEARS THROAT)

34:22.243 --> 34:24.443
Jameelah's been full
of questions about you

34:24.445 --> 34:26.210
and that ambassador killed in Yemen.

34:26.213 --> 34:28.746
(SIGHS) Leave it to our daughter

34:28.748 --> 34:30.114
to betray national security.

34:30.117 --> 34:31.882
JAMEELAH: Daddy's back!

34:31.885 --> 34:34.320
Hey. (GRUNTS)

34:34.322 --> 34:35.955
That's, uh,

34:35.956 --> 34:38.590
much more of a welcome
committee than I'm used to.

34:38.592 --> 34:40.492
She's been asking when you'd
be home every five minutes

34:40.494 --> 34:43.128
since you left.

34:43.130 --> 34:47.466
Will you go to work one
day and never come home...

34:47.467 --> 34:49.601
like the lady?

34:49.603 --> 34:51.003
Told you.

34:51.005 --> 34:53.172
- Hey.
- (SIGHS)

34:53.174 --> 34:55.507
Now, I said not to worry about that.

34:55.509 --> 34:57.009
Right?

34:57.011 --> 35:00.445
Look, Daddy's here now.

35:00.447 --> 35:01.779
But...

35:01.781 --> 35:03.982
can you die at your job?

35:03.984 --> 35:05.984
Honey, Daddy's tired.

35:05.986 --> 35:07.986
(WHISPERS): Let him rest.

35:10.490 --> 35:13.858
Wait. Wait.

35:13.860 --> 35:15.426
Come here, baby. Come to Dad.

35:15.428 --> 35:17.428
Hey.

35:20.800 --> 35:23.764
I will always do everything in my power

35:23.766 --> 35:26.767
to make it back home to you,
your mother and your brother.

35:29.909 --> 35:33.011
But yes...

35:33.013 --> 35:34.678
Daddy could die at work.

35:36.085 --> 35:39.316
I don't want that to happen.

35:39.318 --> 35:42.552
Jameelah... (SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

35:42.554 --> 35:44.795
(EXHALES) No matter what,

35:44.797 --> 35:47.030
I will always be with you, baby girl.

35:48.360 --> 35:49.993
Okay?

35:58.776 --> 36:00.098
(SIGHS) Hey.

36:00.100 --> 36:02.119
Jason, you can't just barge in here.

36:02.121 --> 36:03.573
You-you need to make an appointment.

36:03.575 --> 36:05.875
Yeah, well, you know what?
I left early the other day,

36:05.877 --> 36:07.577
so there's some time left.

36:07.579 --> 36:10.379
Aren't you, uh, supposed
to be away with Natalie?

36:10.381 --> 36:12.272
Well, you know, change of plans, so...

36:12.274 --> 36:14.701
I see. So you are, uh, running away,

36:14.703 --> 36:15.885
- taking the easy way out.
- No, I'm not...

36:15.887 --> 36:17.520
I'm not running away!

36:18.523 --> 36:19.745
- Right.
- Right, you know what?

36:19.747 --> 36:21.587
You have no understanding of the things

36:21.589 --> 36:23.579
that I have seen and I have done.

36:23.581 --> 36:25.453
For 18 years, I've marched into hell

36:25.455 --> 36:27.064
and I have brought it back with me.

36:27.066 --> 36:30.667
That sound like taking
the easy way out? Does it?

36:30.669 --> 36:32.936
Does that sound like taking
the easy way out to you, Doc?

36:32.938 --> 36:34.428
- It doesn't, Jason.
- No.

36:34.430 --> 36:36.709
And I can't possibly
comprehend the horrors

36:36.711 --> 36:38.106
that you've experienced.

36:38.108 --> 36:40.043
And yet, here you are.

36:40.045 --> 36:43.212
And I can try to understand
the cost... I mean,

36:43.214 --> 36:45.201
seeing your... your brothers killed,

36:45.203 --> 36:47.528
not-not knowing if you'll
ever kiss your children again,

36:47.530 --> 36:51.620
watching a once-happy
marriage slowly decay?

36:51.622 --> 36:53.448
And then your wife dies.

36:53.450 --> 36:56.592
I mean, not even Jason
Hayes could handle all that,

36:56.594 --> 37:00.095
all that pain, you know,
all that... all that loss.

37:00.097 --> 37:02.097
(TREMBLING BREATHS)

37:02.099 --> 37:05.486
You asked me the other
day what I was afraid of.

37:05.488 --> 37:07.541
(SNIFFS) Right? You
asked me the other day

37:07.543 --> 37:09.437
what I was afraid of, and that's
what I'm afraid of... loss.

37:09.439 --> 37:11.439
How could you not be afraid, Jason?

37:11.441 --> 37:13.875
Loss is the constant in your life.

37:13.877 --> 37:16.277
It's what drives you
to... to be Bravo 1,

37:16.279 --> 37:18.545
so that you can protect your teammates,

37:18.547 --> 37:22.883
keep from adding another name
to that list in your phone.

37:22.885 --> 37:24.752
- But that same fear...
- (GROANS)

37:24.754 --> 37:27.554
is why Bravo 1 created
his three-foot world.

37:27.556 --> 37:29.590
He pushed your past, your future

37:29.592 --> 37:31.626
and everyone close to you away.

37:31.628 --> 37:34.428
All the sacrifices you
made, ceding your soul

37:34.430 --> 37:36.163
to Bravo 1 was the biggest one.

37:36.165 --> 37:37.632
Ceding my soul?

37:37.634 --> 37:39.399
What, are we gonna start chanting?

37:39.401 --> 37:41.002
Burn the incense, Doc, huh?

37:41.004 --> 37:44.071
You can deflect all you want.

37:44.073 --> 37:45.986
But after years of combat took its toll,

37:45.988 --> 37:47.908
Alana knew that she lost you to Bravo 1,

37:47.910 --> 37:49.110
and now you're afraid that

37:49.112 --> 37:50.477
Natalie will find out, too.

37:50.479 --> 37:52.278
So you're... you're pulling away

37:52.280 --> 37:54.648
so that you don't lose
someone else close to you.

37:54.650 --> 37:56.493
You're grasping.

37:56.495 --> 37:58.685
"I'm dead inside.

I look to the future,
and I don't see anything.

38:01.489 --> 38:04.090
It all looks so empty to me".

38:04.092 --> 38:06.259
Those were your words,
your words, Jason,

38:06.261 --> 38:08.161
the first time you came here.

38:09.597 --> 38:12.966
I was lost then. I'm good now, so...

38:12.968 --> 38:16.522
(SNIFFS, CLEARS THROAT)
Bravo Team is my future now.

38:16.524 --> 38:18.595
Look, it's not for me
to say whether Natalie's

38:18.597 --> 38:20.606
the right woman for you or not, right?

38:20.608 --> 38:22.976
But I can tell you
that you need to be open

38:22.978 --> 38:25.511
for a relationship to work,

38:25.513 --> 38:28.781
and putting Bravo 1 first will
never allow that to happen...

38:28.783 --> 38:31.717
- (EXHALES)
- ... with Natalie or-or anyone else.

38:31.719 --> 38:35.315
Now, all that you've
endured, I can't fault you

38:35.317 --> 38:36.710
for wanting to protect yourself,

38:36.712 --> 38:38.094
but if you want to look into the future

38:38.096 --> 38:39.958
and see anything but loneliness,

38:39.960 --> 38:42.085
then you have to raise the
white flag on your fear,

38:42.087 --> 38:44.897
because right now you are
on a path to emptiness.

38:45.943 --> 38:50.059
Bravo 1 has poisoned your hope of a
life with purpose after operating.

38:50.061 --> 38:51.804
But Natalie?

38:51.806 --> 38:55.741
Jason, she... she might be the antidote.

38:55.743 --> 38:58.065
Right? You push her away now,

38:58.067 --> 39:00.645
you continue to look
only three feet ahead,

39:00.647 --> 39:02.414
you're gonna find
that you're dead inside

39:02.416 --> 39:05.751
the minute you put down your rifle.

39:05.753 --> 39:09.855
Years of war have given
Bravo 1 the upper hand, Jason,

39:09.857 --> 39:13.658
but remember: you are
never out of the fight.
