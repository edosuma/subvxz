WEBVTT

00:02.815 --> 00:04.949
JESS:
Guess what! I got balloons.

00:04.966 --> 00:06.901
From a guy in a van.

00:06.968 --> 00:08.036
I love this
neighborhood.

00:08.103 --> 00:09.287
I just love it.

00:09.354 --> 00:11.355
Oh, what does that...?
"Me so horny." Very good.

00:11.423 --> 00:14.192
"No credit, no problem!"
And "Happy 100th, Jane!"

00:14.260 --> 00:16.093
I don't think she made it,
but she lived a good life.

00:16.161 --> 00:17.895
NICK (Shouts):
Shut up!

00:17.962 --> 00:19.296
Who booby-trapped me?
(Phone ringing)

00:19.363 --> 00:21.265
Stop! Shut up!

00:21.332 --> 00:23.233
It's my mom.

00:23.801 --> 00:26.536
Get off of me!

00:26.604 --> 00:28.705
NICK: Yeah, Mom, hey.
(High-pitched): Nick's just mad

00:28.773 --> 00:30.207
'cause that punk-ass balloon
beat his ass.

00:30.275 --> 00:31.475
Hey, no huffing.
Come on, guys.

00:31.508 --> 00:33.209
(High-pitched):
Take these seriously, Winston.

00:33.277 --> 00:37.313
I didn't buy the balloons
to have you guys...

00:37.880 --> 00:41.117
(High-pitched): If you do that one more
time, I'm gonna break your faces in.

00:41.185 --> 00:42.785
(High-pitched laughter)

00:47.123 --> 00:48.957
Uh, my dad died.

00:51.660 --> 00:53.428
Yeah, I guess he had
a heart attack.

00:53.495 --> 00:55.931
I got to go back to, uh, Chicago

00:55.998 --> 00:58.934
and, uh, go to the
funeral and everything.

01:00.501 --> 01:02.170
(Sighs)

01:02.238 --> 01:04.205
Well, are you guys
gonna say anything or...

01:05.072 --> 01:06.271
(High-pitched):

01:06.272 --> 01:08.675
- That's terrible, Nick.
- Wow, we're so sorry.

01:08.743 --> 01:10.110
SCHMIDT: If there's
anything we can do, please.

01:10.178 --> 01:11.111
Come here. Not Walt. Just...

01:11.179 --> 01:12.012
- Give me a hug.
- Nick.

01:12.480 --> 01:13.780
We love you.

01:13.848 --> 01:14.815
Love you, Nick.

01:14.882 --> 01:16.317
Stay strong.

JESS: So this is where
Nick Miller grew up.

01:28.362 --> 01:30.830
Well, except for the fall of '88
to spring of '89.

01:30.898 --> 01:32.765
That was our van year.

01:32.833 --> 01:34.100
JESS: I just
want you to know

01:34.168 --> 01:36.268
- I am here for you.
- Okay.

01:36.336 --> 01:37.402
I'm gonna be strong
for you, man.

01:37.470 --> 01:39.004
You know, I really
did love Walt.

01:39.072 --> 01:40.605
He was my dad, Winston.

01:40.673 --> 01:42.440
Yeah, but, I mean, he loved me
more than he loved you.

01:42.508 --> 01:44.442
- He told me that.
- Yeah, he told me that, too, actually.

01:44.510 --> 01:46.011
Sorry.
(Sighs)

01:46.079 --> 01:47.179
- You okay, Schmidt?
- I didn't want

01:47.247 --> 01:48.446
to make this about me, but...

01:48.514 --> 01:49.948
the airline lost my bag.

01:50.016 --> 01:51.382
I wanted
to look fantastic

01:51.449 --> 01:53.251
for your father's funeral.

01:53.318 --> 01:55.286
Now I have nothing
but the <i>schmatta</i> on my back.

01:55.354 --> 01:58.489
NICK:
All right. Let's do this.

01:58.556 --> 02:00.124
WINSTON: Uh, Jess,
we should warn you.

02:00.192 --> 02:02.659
Nick's family--
a little crazy.

02:02.727 --> 02:04.395
MAN 1: It's called pop!
MAN 2: Just call it soda.

02:04.462 --> 02:05.696
- It's soda, all right?
- It's not! It's not!

02:05.764 --> 02:06.997
Hey, Uncle Nicky.
Hey, man.

02:07.064 --> 02:08.544
- No, it's called soda.
- It's called pop!

02:08.565 --> 02:09.925
It's called soda.
It's called soda.

02:09.934 --> 02:11.234
Why would you call it
soda if it's pop?

02:11.302 --> 02:12.635
- You call your dad pop!
- Hey.

02:12.703 --> 02:13.937
- It's Nick.
- Hey. Nickels.

02:14.005 --> 02:15.405
My brother Nick's
back, guys.

02:15.472 --> 02:17.207
- My condolences, all right?
- Hey, thanks for making it out.

02:17.275 --> 02:18.841
Sorry about that.
Your brother's being a douche.

02:18.910 --> 02:20.630
Yeah. I'm not being a douche!
I'm emotional!

02:20.644 --> 02:22.205
- Oh, God...
- You've been a douche all day.

02:22.246 --> 02:23.645
- I mean, why?
- I know. I know.

02:23.713 --> 02:25.680
You been... you been
crying a bunch, buddy?

02:25.748 --> 02:27.349
- No.
- He'll get your shoulder all wet, too.

02:27.384 --> 02:29.618
Hey, look, don't do
the hair-pull. It's so intimate.

02:29.685 --> 02:31.053
NICK: You okay?
JAMIE: I'm not okay!

02:31.121 --> 02:33.289
Jamie, here's what I need you
to do: Grab a bunch of kids

02:33.356 --> 02:35.224
and teach them how
to build a snowman outside.

02:35.292 --> 02:37.159
I can't do that!
I already did it already!

02:37.227 --> 02:39.160
- He put the carrot in the crotch.
- Why'd you put the carrot in the crotch?

02:39.228 --> 02:40.761
JAMIE: 'Cause they told me to!
NICK: They're kids.

02:40.829 --> 02:42.563
JAMIE: Those kids are cool!
I wanted to hang out!

02:42.631 --> 02:43.864
Don't trust cops.

02:43.933 --> 02:45.333
Nicky!

02:45.401 --> 02:47.868
- Hey, Ma.
- Oh.

02:47.937 --> 02:50.405
Oh. I miss him, Nicky.

02:50.472 --> 02:53.341
- Yeah, I know, Ma.
- That bastard was a saint.

02:53.409 --> 02:54.642
A saint.

02:54.709 --> 02:55.708
The bastard.

02:55.776 --> 02:57.344
I know. Come here. Hey.

02:57.412 --> 02:58.711
This is getting
very personal. May...

02:58.779 --> 03:00.513
Maybe none of us should go
to the funeral.

03:00.581 --> 03:03.350
The early buzz on this thing is
that it's gonna be a real drag.

03:03.418 --> 03:06.286
So what still needs to get done?
We need to, uh, get the groceries,

03:06.354 --> 03:09.256
- uh, plan the funeral, call the paper...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:09.324 --> 03:10.890
Did you say "plan the funeral"?

03:10.958 --> 03:12.425
That's why you're here, Nicky.

03:12.492 --> 03:14.160
You take care of everything.

03:14.227 --> 03:17.629
- I got the napkins!
- Oh, that's so hot.

03:17.697 --> 03:20.199
- Great, Jamie.
- Is Nick taking care of people?

03:20.267 --> 03:22.101
Yeah, with Pop-Pop coming
and going, Nick had to step up

03:22.169 --> 03:23.535
and be the man of the family.

03:23.603 --> 03:25.083
Pretty much takes care
of all of them.

03:25.105 --> 03:27.439
Don't laugh when they call him
responsible.

03:27.506 --> 03:29.441
They don't know
why that's hilarious.

03:29.508 --> 03:32.743
Um... Oh... Hi, Mrs. Miller.

03:32.811 --> 03:34.779
I'm so sorry
for your loss.

03:34.847 --> 03:37.182
- If there's anything I can do to help, I...
- Who are you?

03:37.249 --> 03:39.817
- Oh, I'm sorry. I'm Jess.
NICK: This is Jess, my new roommate.

03:39.885 --> 03:41.519
- Um, so nice to meet you.
- I've told you about her.

03:41.587 --> 03:43.820
Winnie and Fat Schmidt I know.
Hey, boys.

03:43.888 --> 03:44.821
JESS: I just wanted to say that

03:44.889 --> 03:46.390
I'm here and happy

03:46.458 --> 03:49.159
- to do anything.
- Is she a Spanish?

03:49.227 --> 03:51.962
Um... I'm from Portland, Oregon.

03:52.030 --> 03:53.897
Land of books.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.802
(Chuckles)
Trailblazers.

03:58.870 --> 04:00.036
Hmm.

04:01.405 --> 04:03.706
Are you guys, uh...

04:03.773 --> 04:06.133
- Jamie, I'm begging you to shut up.
- Your father always wanted

04:06.176 --> 04:07.656
to have a funeral
just like Elvis had,

04:07.711 --> 04:09.712
so that's what
we're gonna give him.

04:09.779 --> 04:11.814
- A funeral like Elvis had?
- That means...

04:11.882 --> 04:15.183
12 white limos
and an Elvis impersonator...

04:15.251 --> 04:16.151
NICK: Dad's gonna
get the funeral

04:16.219 --> 04:17.519
you want him to have, okay?

04:17.586 --> 04:18.920
So tell me what needs
to get done,

04:18.988 --> 04:20.154
and I'll just do it.

04:20.223 --> 04:22.357
Oh, the eulogy.

04:23.425 --> 04:24.126
You...

04:24.193 --> 04:25.327
- you'll do the eulogy, right?
- Oh...

04:25.395 --> 04:27.595
I don't think I should do it.

04:27.663 --> 04:29.597
You just say a bunch
of nice stuff all in a row.

04:29.665 --> 04:31.198
- Do it, College. You got it.
- Nick, you have to.

04:31.266 --> 04:32.866
JESS: You should do it.
JAMIE: Come on, Nicky.

04:32.934 --> 04:34.235
You should do it. Do a good poem.
Do one of your good ones.

04:34.302 --> 04:36.103
BOBBY: Come on, man.
You got to.

04:36.671 --> 04:38.471
Yeah, okay. Sure. I'll, uh...

04:38.540 --> 04:40.774
That's my boy.

04:40.842 --> 04:43.410
He takes care of everything.

04:51.752 --> 04:53.354
- Hey.
- Hey, Jess.

04:53.422 --> 04:54.555
It's like a whole
secret life for you.

04:55.323 --> 04:57.124
You're not even looking
at the numbers.

04:57.192 --> 04:59.293
Aunt Ruthie used to call this
the Iron Jew.

04:59.361 --> 05:00.628
Wow.
(Chuckles)

05:01.696 --> 05:03.128
Are you having time
to process this?

05:03.196 --> 05:04.863
Yeah, I'm just
trying to figure out

05:04.931 --> 05:06.732
the level of Elvis impersonator
we can afford.

05:06.799 --> 05:07.367
Uh-huh.

05:07.435 --> 05:09.369
And I think a white one's
out of reach.

05:09.437 --> 05:11.003
Is there anything
I could do to help?

05:11.571 --> 05:13.406
- The eulogy.
- Sorry?

05:13.474 --> 05:16.476
Oh, that would be really helpful 'cause
that's been getting in my way a little bit.

05:16.544 --> 05:18.444
I didn't really know
your dad except...

05:18.511 --> 05:21.447
the one hour that I
committed fraud with him.

05:21.514 --> 05:22.914
That's all there is
to know, really.

05:22.949 --> 05:24.149
I think that's, you know,
one task

05:24.217 --> 05:25.917
I think maybe
is better if you...

05:25.985 --> 05:27.919
Look, I've got to figure out
an Elvis theme.

05:27.987 --> 05:30.856
You know, Elvis-themed flowers
and food and music all in a day.

05:30.923 --> 05:32.391
I just... You asked
if there was anything

05:32.459 --> 05:34.459
you could do, and there is.

05:35.726 --> 05:36.394
Okay.

05:36.462 --> 05:37.502
- Yay! Thank you.
- I'll do it.

05:37.529 --> 05:39.063
- Yeah.
- Oh, you are the best.

05:40.631 --> 05:41.866
- Hey, Nick.
- Yeah.

05:41.933 --> 05:45.503
For Elvis-themed music,
what about Elvis?

05:45.571 --> 05:46.804
I'm really...
I'm so slammed right now.

05:46.872 --> 05:48.072
I can't hear, like, new stuff.

05:50.975 --> 05:53.677
WINSTON: Looking good, man.
This was Walt's best suit.

05:53.745 --> 05:54.811
Look at all these buttons,
Winston.

05:54.879 --> 05:56.280
I look like a remote control.

05:56.347 --> 05:58.482
- It looks good.
- I can't mourn in this.

05:58.549 --> 06:00.684
- I don't even know how to use these buttons.
- Hey, look,

06:00.752 --> 06:01.885
we're not mourning, okay?

06:02.452 --> 06:04.755
This is a celebration, you know?
That's what funerals are about...

06:04.822 --> 06:06.322
Winston, I just can't go
to the funeral, okay?

06:06.390 --> 06:08.157
- I don't want to go!
- What the hell is the problem?

06:09.224 --> 06:11.160
Look, I really want
to support Nick. I do.

06:11.527 --> 06:12.728
I want to support
his family.

06:12.796 --> 06:14.497
I want to be there
for him, but...

06:15.714 --> 06:17.199
I'm scared of death.

06:19.017 --> 06:20.703
Uh... wow. Uh...

06:21.271 --> 06:23.204
Schmidt, you know,
death is natural, you know?

06:23.272 --> 06:25.372
It's a natural part of life.
Everybody's scared of death.

06:25.440 --> 06:27.942
Death, Winston.

06:28.010 --> 06:31.045
(Whispering):
Death. Death.

06:31.113 --> 06:32.879
And let me ask you something,
Winston:

06:32.947 --> 06:35.148
What's with this
open casket thing?

06:35.216 --> 06:36.917
All of a sudden,
I-I got to walk in

06:36.984 --> 06:38.519
and I got to see the carcass?

06:38.586 --> 06:39.953
That's crazy.

06:40.021 --> 06:41.622
What if... what
if his eyes open?

06:41.690 --> 06:43.424
What if his eyes open,
and then he comes

06:43.542 --> 06:45.142
and haunts all of us?
Why do... Why...

06:45.210 --> 06:46.777
Literally, why are
the buttons on here?

06:46.844 --> 06:48.144
Because they're not holding
anything together,

06:48.212 --> 06:49.546
yet I don't know
which buttons are buttoned.

06:49.613 --> 06:51.247
How do you get this thing off,
Winston?!

06:51.315 --> 06:52.882
I don't understand this
middle-class button system!

06:52.950 --> 06:53.883
Get it off of me!

06:53.951 --> 06:56.652
(Panting)

06:56.720 --> 06:59.155
So I don't think I'm gonna go
to the funeral, man.

06:59.223 --> 07:01.491
I think I'm gonna hang back.

07:01.559 --> 07:04.859
So, um, I'm helping Nick
with the eulogy.

07:04.927 --> 07:06.861
I'll give you the goods
on Walt, Glasses Face.

07:06.929 --> 07:09.698
My pop had a table
at every diner in the city.

07:09.765 --> 07:13.168
He had silverware from
the finest hotels in the area.

07:13.236 --> 07:16.305
He had a gold chain
as thick as floss.

07:16.372 --> 07:18.740
But, like, thick floss.

07:18.808 --> 07:20.575
Wait, Walt's got that chain?

07:20.642 --> 07:21.809
Yeah, he got that chain.
That's his chain.

07:21.876 --> 07:23.578
That was my dad's chain.

07:23.645 --> 07:25.079
No, it was Walt's
signature piece.

07:25.147 --> 07:27.248
No, he got that from
the Seiko watch deal.

07:27.316 --> 07:29.683
No, he got it from
the dishwasher arrangement.

07:29.751 --> 07:31.072
- No, he didn't.
JAMIE: Yes, he did.

07:31.086 --> 07:32.606
My dad took a dart
in the eye for that.

07:32.621 --> 07:34.122
I don't care what
your dad took a dart

07:34.189 --> 07:35.489
- in the eye for.
- Guys. Guys, guys, guys.

07:35.556 --> 07:37.524
- Can we refocus?
JAMIE: I can't!

07:37.592 --> 07:40.560
- Because he's accusing my
father of thievery!    - Hey!

07:40.628 --> 07:42.429
- Can we just talk about Walt?
JAMIE: Yeah, so what's the deal

07:42.497 --> 07:44.664
with you and Nick?
Are you guys, uh...

07:45.732 --> 07:46.600
Could you...

07:46.667 --> 07:48.168
could you stop doing that
with your eyebrows?

07:49.236 --> 07:51.570
Please stop
doing... Stop.

07:51.638 --> 07:53.199
- They're doing it. They're doing it.
- Yeah.

07:53.206 --> 07:56.008
- No.
- Whoever denied it supplied it.

07:56.075 --> 07:57.943
Now, this would
be the casket.

07:59.011 --> 08:00.446
(Sighs)
And now I'm dead.

08:00.514 --> 08:02.648
- So approach me and don't be afraid.
- Just promise

08:02.715 --> 08:04.650
not to move, all right?

08:04.717 --> 08:07.019
- That's what I'm afraid of most.
- Are you k... are you kidding me?

08:07.086 --> 08:09.187
- Also, you can't breathe.
- Schmidt, I need to breathe, okay?

08:09.255 --> 08:11.222
Because I'm coaching you, and
also for regular life reasons.

08:11.290 --> 08:12.858
Now, just calm down,

08:12.925 --> 08:15.861
find a joyful memory and
let it lift you to the sky.

08:15.928 --> 08:19.197
(Exhales)

08:19.265 --> 08:21.399
(Sighs)

08:21.467 --> 08:23.701
You left us too soon,

08:23.769 --> 08:26.103
- you beautiful black butterfly.
- Start over.

08:26.171 --> 08:28.139
You know, when we first met,

08:28.206 --> 08:31.108
I thought that we
would be rivals.

08:31.176 --> 08:34.979
For Nick's attention,
for who wore Easter colors best.

08:35.047 --> 08:39.416
And then rivalry
became friendship.

08:39.484 --> 08:43.186
(Chuckles)

08:46.040 --> 08:48.474
We've laughed, we've swum.

08:48.542 --> 08:50.676
You cut my toenails.

08:50.744 --> 08:52.711
Are you the brother
that I never had?

08:52.779 --> 08:54.847
No.

08:55.165 --> 08:57.816
- You're the brother that I've always had.
- That was beautiful.

08:57.883 --> 08:59.584
(Shouts) What are you doing, man?!
- You moved! Whoa! What the hell?

08:59.652 --> 09:01.236
Of course I moved!
I'm not a real dead person!

09:01.404 --> 09:02.838
- You ghoul!
- Why do I do this for you?

09:02.906 --> 09:04.472
Forget it, man.
I'm never going to this thing.

09:04.540 --> 09:06.075
- You just made it worse.
- What's wrong with you?

09:06.142 --> 09:07.475
$2,000?

09:07.543 --> 09:09.244
What if it wasn't
six feet under?

09:09.912 --> 09:11.146
- How much for three feet?
- I've gone through

09:11.214 --> 09:12.847
half a pack of ciggie gum here.

09:12.915 --> 09:15.316
- You want some of my weed?
- Where are we on the food?

09:15.383 --> 09:16.751
We-we got
to have Elvis food.

09:16.819 --> 09:19.386
- Ma, I'm making calls right now.
- It's got to be perfect.

09:19.454 --> 09:22.156
- It's gonna be perfect. You just got to let me
do it.   - If the food isn't Elvis-themed,

09:22.224 --> 09:24.491
- does it matter that much?
- You got a problem with Elvis?

09:24.559 --> 09:27.095
- I don't... (Stammers)  - No, she didn't say that.
I'm gonna have to call you back.

09:27.162 --> 09:28.962
- No, she didn't say that. She didn't say
that about Elvis. - I was just suggesting

09:29.030 --> 09:30.597
that maybe the Elvis theme
doesn't matter as much...

09:30.664 --> 09:32.099
You don't think Elvis
is important?

09:32.166 --> 09:33.967
- She knows Elvis is important, Ma!
- Elvis is everything!

09:34.035 --> 09:36.236
I know. He's the King.
He's the King.

09:36.303 --> 09:38.605
I'm sorry, Bonnie.
He's the King.

09:38.672 --> 09:40.974
- Jess.
- Nick...

09:41.042 --> 09:44.810
- I'm here to help, but I can't
write this eulogy. - Wait, what?

09:44.878 --> 09:47.046
- Do you want some of my weed?
NICK: I asked you to do one thing.

09:47.114 --> 09:49.181
- I need you to write the eulogy.
- But I didn't know Walt.

09:49.249 --> 09:51.784
Nobody wants to hear what I have
to say about my dad.

09:51.852 --> 09:53.753
It doesn't matter what you say.
You just... you h...

09:53.820 --> 09:55.287
you have to say good-bye to him.

09:55.355 --> 09:57.489
I'm not asking you
to do too much.

09:57.557 --> 10:00.458
Just write my father's eulogy.

10:00.525 --> 10:01.793
I can't handle this!

10:01.861 --> 10:03.928
JESS: Nick.
BOBBY: My dad's chain!

10:03.996 --> 10:05.009
JESS: Nick.
BOBBY: I want that chain!

10:05.010 --> 10:06.931
JAMIE: Hey, Nick! Nick!
He popped me right in my cherry!

10:06.999 --> 10:08.800
That's not what that means,
Jamie!

10:08.868 --> 10:10.268
JAMIE: Then what does it mean?!
JESS: Nick!

10:10.335 --> 10:12.436
Where are you going?
(Door shuts)

10:13.004 --> 10:15.140
I forgot my jacket.
It's really cold outside!

10:15.207 --> 10:16.339
JESS:
Nick, wait!

10:17.207 --> 10:18.074
JAMIE: Ow!

10:21.457 --> 10:23.257
(Organ playing)

10:28.529 --> 10:29.530
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:29.597 --> 10:31.132
When's the last time
you saw Nick?

10:31.199 --> 10:32.483
- Is he not here?
- What are you guys talking about?

10:32.551 --> 10:33.885
Schmidt, if you want to
hear what we're saying,

10:33.952 --> 10:35.319
- come over here.
- Don't shout across the room.

10:35.387 --> 10:36.654
It's bad luck to see the body
before the funeral.

10:36.722 --> 10:38.289
No, that's, like,
a wedding thing, Schmidt.

10:38.356 --> 10:39.589
Shh.

10:39.657 --> 10:40.490
I think I said something
to Nick.

10:40.558 --> 10:41.758
I think this is my fault.

10:41.826 --> 10:43.894
Hey, everybody!
I brought Elvis!

10:43.961 --> 10:45.495
NICK: Funeral saved.
WINSTON: What?

10:45.563 --> 10:47.831
- Hey, happy funeral, Jess.
- What happened?

10:47.899 --> 10:49.499
What happened is I found
this guy at the bar

10:49.567 --> 10:51.001
and he fits into the costume,

10:51.069 --> 10:52.803
so for 20 bucks,
he's gonna be Elvis.

10:53.120 --> 10:55.321
I thought you wanted me
to kill Elvis for 20 bucks.

10:55.388 --> 10:57.456
Then why would I give
you the outfit, Brendan?

10:57.523 --> 10:58.874
The element of surprise?

10:58.875 --> 11:00.109
(Chuckling): Yeah.
- The mirror effect?

11:00.177 --> 11:01.410
- He's gonna be perfect.
- Mmm.

11:01.977 --> 11:03.079
Whose birthday is it?

11:03.146 --> 11:04.113
No, it's my dad's funeral.

11:04.181 --> 11:05.280
I'm gonna go find cake.

11:05.348 --> 11:06.588
How much have you had to drink?

11:06.649 --> 11:08.350
One dozen beers.
And I wrote...

11:08.418 --> 11:10.285
I did what you asked me
to do, Jessica.

11:10.353 --> 11:12.053
- I wrote the, uh, gigleography.
- The what?

11:12.121 --> 11:13.688
- The gigleography.
- A "gigleography"?

11:13.756 --> 11:15.090
Urology.

11:15.157 --> 11:16.758
Elegy?
Eulogish.

11:16.826 --> 11:17.892
You wrote the eulogy.

11:17.960 --> 11:19.081
That's what I've been saying

11:19.095 --> 11:19.994
the whole time--
it's right here.

11:20.062 --> 11:22.296
"Walt Miller. Am I right?"

11:22.364 --> 11:24.699
Am I right? Am I right?

11:24.767 --> 11:27.101
- That's terrible.
- Googaliogy!

11:27.168 --> 11:28.568
All right, here's
what we're gonna do.

11:28.636 --> 11:31.338
I'm gonna sober up Nick
and... and Elvis.

11:31.405 --> 11:33.440
You, go buy us some time.

11:33.507 --> 11:35.342
All right, Schmidt,
stop asking people

11:35.409 --> 11:37.544
- if they can smell the body.
That is rude.     -  I'll try.

11:37.612 --> 11:39.412
- It's inappropriate and it's offensive, okay?
- Okay, but I just...

11:39.480 --> 11:40.748
- All right? It's what I...
- ...it's what I'm thinking.

11:40.815 --> 11:42.582
I got this. Shh. I got this.

11:42.650 --> 11:44.410
- Just don't say anything, okay? Come on.
- Hi...

11:49.022 --> 11:51.190
Uh... the chain.

11:52.492 --> 11:54.393
Some... someone should stop...

11:54.461 --> 11:56.162
'Cause he's
taking the chain.

11:59.298 --> 12:00.132
Hey, hey, quit it, man.

12:00.199 --> 12:01.432
- Don't do that.
- Hey, beat it, Cali.

12:01.500 --> 12:02.467
Long Island, son.

12:02.534 --> 12:04.369
- I don't care.
- Get off of it, man.

12:04.436 --> 12:05.771
- Just stop it. Stop it.
- You touching me? You touching me?

12:05.838 --> 12:07.172
- Yeah, I'm touching you.
- You don't touch me.

12:07.240 --> 12:08.807
- I don't want to go near that.
- You don't touch me!

12:08.875 --> 12:09.707
- Quit it.
- Do you want to go?

12:09.776 --> 12:11.877
(Stammers)

12:11.944 --> 12:13.444
Come on, do it.
Come on, come on.

12:13.512 --> 12:14.579
- Here we go.
- Get away from Walt's chain, man!

12:14.647 --> 12:15.545
I'm just saying...

12:15.613 --> 12:17.281
I... n-no! N-n-n-n-no!

12:17.348 --> 12:19.150
Please, no, no, no, no! No!

12:19.217 --> 12:20.751
- Desecration!
- Shut up.

12:20.819 --> 12:21.718
(Shouts)
Shut up.

12:21.787 --> 12:22.753
There's no desecration.

12:23.821 --> 12:24.855
Don't interrupt me.

12:24.923 --> 12:26.023
That's my dad's chain,
and I'm taking it.

12:26.091 --> 12:28.025
- Shut your mouth.
- What's wrong with you?

12:28.093 --> 12:30.060
(Whispering):
Bobby, shut up.

12:33.663 --> 12:35.499
Dude, he's dead.
What are you doing?

12:36.566 --> 12:37.967
- What are you doing?
- Ooh!

12:39.035 --> 12:40.003
- What are you doing?
- I'm not afraid.

12:40.070 --> 12:41.704
Not afraid of what?
I'm not afraid.

12:42.272 --> 12:43.873
I can do this.

12:44.441 --> 12:47.242
I can do this all day.

12:47.310 --> 12:48.877
- Come on, don't do that.
- All day, son.

12:48.945 --> 12:50.665
Come on, don't-don't
put your head in there.

12:50.713 --> 12:52.633
- Don't put your head in there, all right?
- All day.

12:52.648 --> 12:54.016
- Dude, that's my uncle.
SCHMIDT: Come get your chain, Boston!

12:54.083 --> 12:55.217
What? All day!

12:55.285 --> 12:57.552
All day! All day!

12:58.120 --> 12:59.554
- All day!
- I don't need it.

12:59.622 --> 13:02.424
- I don't want it.
- What's up!

13:02.491 --> 13:04.591
I know you told me to
write it, but I couldn't.

13:04.659 --> 13:06.493
I didn't have
anything to say.

13:06.561 --> 13:07.761
You're mad at me.

13:07.829 --> 13:09.530
You've got the mad face.

13:09.597 --> 13:11.598
I'm not mad at you, Nick.

13:11.666 --> 13:12.966
I'm not mad at you.

13:13.034 --> 13:14.868
I have your back.

13:14.936 --> 13:17.538
No matter what, no matter
how stupid it gets, and...

13:17.605 --> 13:20.239
you and I both know

13:20.307 --> 13:22.842
it can get really,
really stupid.

13:22.909 --> 13:25.712
- I am the stupidest of all the stupid boys.
- No.

13:25.779 --> 13:29.215
I'm gonna be there,
and I'm gonna hold your hand,

13:29.282 --> 13:31.484
and I wanted
to tell you that last night,

13:31.552 --> 13:33.453
but you ran away.

13:34.320 --> 13:35.221
Yeah.

13:35.288 --> 13:36.755
(Loud grunt)

13:38.224 --> 13:39.958
(Grumbles, sighs)

13:40.025 --> 13:41.660
I want to meet your mom.

13:41.728 --> 13:42.994
JESS:
Oh, my God.

13:43.062 --> 13:44.796
Hey, Elvis!

13:44.864 --> 13:47.399
What are we going to do, Winnie?

13:47.467 --> 13:49.735
- Everyone's waiting.
- Mrs. Miller, how about I just

13:49.802 --> 13:51.035
go up there
and I say a few words?

13:51.103 --> 13:52.737
- Keep it light, keep it happy.
- Right.

13:52.804 --> 13:55.105
Don't mention
the felony thing.

13:55.673 --> 13:57.107
Or Paraguay,

13:57.175 --> 14:00.243
or the storage space.

14:00.310 --> 14:01.578
Hey, y'all.

14:02.145 --> 14:03.747
Ah...

14:03.814 --> 14:05.648
Now, some of y'all know me.

14:05.716 --> 14:06.816
I am Winston.

14:07.786 --> 14:10.754
And I look at today
as a celebration.

14:10.821 --> 14:11.755
- So let's have a party.
MAN: That's right.

14:11.822 --> 14:13.423
You know, because a party

14:13.491 --> 14:15.724
is what Walt would have...

14:19.662 --> 14:23.432
(Clearing throat)

14:24.500 --> 14:25.701
(Choking up):
A party is...

14:25.769 --> 14:27.335
a party, uh...

14:27.404 --> 14:28.504
(Sobs)

14:30.773 --> 14:33.741
- Walt would have wanted us to have a party.
WOMAN: Oh, dear.

14:33.809 --> 14:35.610
(Winston grunts)

14:35.677 --> 14:36.778
(Groans)

14:36.845 --> 14:38.045
(Quietly):
I can do this.

14:38.113 --> 14:40.281
I can do this, I can do this.

14:41.784 --> 14:43.918
(Wails)

14:46.054 --> 14:48.789
(Wailing sobs)

14:48.856 --> 14:51.090
Oh, Walt!

14:53.227 --> 14:55.194
I can't do this no more, Walt!

14:55.262 --> 14:57.898
(Winston wails)

14:57.965 --> 14:59.365
(Wailing continues in distance)

14:59.434 --> 15:01.134
Hey. You done with this?

15:01.201 --> 15:02.335
Hey! What's going on?

15:02.403 --> 15:03.903
(Gasps)
(Groans)

15:03.970 --> 15:05.638
- This is Elvis?
- No...

15:05.705 --> 15:07.145
This funeral's
going down the toilet.

15:07.206 --> 15:08.407
I promised
Walter it'd be

15:08.475 --> 15:10.042
beautiful and full of life.

15:10.109 --> 15:11.811
I promised.

15:11.878 --> 15:12.812
I'm sending everyone home.

15:12.879 --> 15:14.413
Wait. Bonnie.

15:14.481 --> 15:16.549
Are you tapping me on
the shoulder, girlie?

15:16.616 --> 15:18.550
Let me make this
totally clear.

15:18.617 --> 15:19.751
I don't want you here.

15:19.819 --> 15:20.919
I don't know you.

15:20.986 --> 15:22.320
I don't know your people.

15:23.689 --> 15:25.156
You tap me twice?

15:25.223 --> 15:26.858
I... please wait for Nick.

15:26.926 --> 15:27.959
It's important.

15:28.026 --> 15:29.761
Then why is he not here?

15:29.829 --> 15:32.263
No eulogy? No Elvis?

15:32.331 --> 15:33.765
I'd rather not have a funeral

15:33.833 --> 15:35.466
if it's not gonna
honor my husband.

15:35.533 --> 15:37.067

(Mumbles):
And I'm out.

15:43.541 --> 15:45.275
(Clears throat)
I want to thank you for coming,

15:45.343 --> 15:49.012
but it's, uh, over now, so...

15:49.080 --> 15:50.713
(Crowd murmuring)

15:52.916 --> 15:54.283
JESS (Imitating Elvis):
Stop the funeral!

15:54.351 --> 15:55.852
Everybody sit down.

15:58.589 --> 16:00.823
This is the King.

16:00.891 --> 16:01.724
What the hell?

16:01.792 --> 16:03.359
I think you mean...

16:03.426 --> 16:05.427
"What the heaven?"

16:05.896 --> 16:07.028
Mama.

16:07.096 --> 16:08.096

(Sighs)

(Exhales)

17:25.904 --> 17:27.369
I used to always tell my dad

17:27.438 --> 17:29.940
that I hated Elvis
just to piss him off.

17:31.007 --> 17:32.776
And he would get really mad

17:32.843 --> 17:35.612
the way Walt
could get <i>really</i> mad.

17:35.680 --> 17:38.381
And, uh,
he would turn it up loud

17:38.449 --> 17:42.118
just to spite me and sing
all the Elvis songs.

17:46.590 --> 17:48.223

in the whole scheme

Stay out of Boston.

- I work TSA at Logan.

19:59.992 --> 20:02.427
is this fishing wire

20:02.495 --> 20:04.128
and a Wrigley ticket stub
with a button,

20:04.196 --> 20:05.630
