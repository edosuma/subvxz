WEBVTT

00:07.448 --> 00:08.931
- Okay, we're moving on
to item 129 A, Part 3.

00:09.034 --> 00:10.068
- 129 A, or
are we doing B first?

00:10.172 --> 00:11.620
We're going A. Okay.

00:11.724 --> 00:13.000
- You know, I feel like
because we had a little bit of

00:13.103 --> 00:14.448
a hard time discussing 128 F--

00:14.551 --> 00:16.241
- Yep, we did.
- Let's just discuss--

00:16.344 --> 00:17.448
- So we can table that?
- The protocol for discussing--

00:17.551 --> 00:18.896
- Why don't we just--
Okay. Cool.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.241
- 128.
- We'll discuss what we'll do.

00:20.344 --> 00:21.517
we'll table that. We'll discuss
how we discuss that.

00:53.275 --> 00:54.620
and make you pay for
the alimony.

00:54.724 --> 00:56.172
Do you understand how mad
I am at you right now?

Nothing feels as good

02:03.344 --> 02:05.068
- Really? Have you ever had sex?

02:05.172 --> 02:06.724
Because
emptying your email inbox

02:06.827 --> 02:08.413
actually does
feel better than that.

02:08.517 --> 02:10.000
What are you doing this weekend?

02:10.103 --> 02:11.413
- Well, I'm going on a hike

02:11.517 --> 02:13.448
with some old college buddies
on Saturday.

02:13.551 --> 02:15.931
Then I have a Groupon for this
gourmet grilled cheese place.

02:16.034 --> 02:18.068
I have another Groupon
to get an oil change.

02:18.172 --> 02:21.000
Brunch with my stepsister,
uh, I have a Groupon for that.

02:21.103 --> 02:22.517
And, oh,

02:22.620 --> 02:24.206
I need to get a haircut
at some point.

02:24.310 --> 02:26.655
Basically, I'm trying to cram
my entire life into 48 hours,

02:26.758 --> 02:27.931
and I won't enjoy
a second of it.

02:28.034 --> 02:29.310
What about you?

02:29.413 --> 02:30.379
- Oh, I'm gonna lie in bed
depressed all weekend.

02:30.482 --> 02:33.758
I've been looking forward
to it all week.

02:34.793 --> 02:37.000
Oh, I got Peddles
a new cardboard box.

02:37.103 --> 02:38.413
She's gonna love it
so fucking much.

02:38.517 --> 02:39.758
It's gonna be so fucking cute.

02:39.862 --> 02:41.586
I'll hardly be able
to fucking stand it.

02:41.689 --> 02:44.758
- I don't like the way
you talk about cats.

02:44.862 --> 02:46.000
- So...

02:46.103 --> 02:48.068
you dips coming to
my house party Saturday night,

02:48.172 --> 02:49.310
or what?
I saw that you both opened,

02:49.413 --> 02:52.758
yet did not RSVP,
to my Paperless Post,

02:52.862 --> 02:54.000
which is a real dick move.

02:54.103 --> 02:56.310
- Your only response options
were, "No, I hate fun,"

02:56.413 --> 02:57.241
or "Hells to the yeah."

02:57.344 --> 02:59.379
I'm an eternal maybe.

02:59.482 --> 03:01.172
I want the option to back out
of a party up until the moment

03:01.275 --> 03:02.103
I walk through the front door.

03:02.206 --> 03:04.310
- Matt, you have to come.

03:04.413 --> 03:06.103
I'm setting you up
with my friend Daphne.

03:06.206 --> 03:07.724
She already photo-approved you.

03:07.827 --> 03:09.896
She said you look
just like her ex-boyfriend,

03:10.000 --> 03:11.103
but with worse hair.

03:11.206 --> 03:12.586
- Really?
That's sort of encouraging.

03:12.689 --> 03:14.068
- Jake,
I thought about setting you up,

03:14.172 --> 03:16.103
but then I remembered,
I actually like my friends.

03:16.206 --> 03:18.103
- Oh. I totally get that.

03:18.206 --> 03:19.448
- Any plans for
the weekend, Kate?

03:19.551 --> 03:20.827
If you're not too busy,
maybe we could--

03:20.931 --> 03:22.655
- I have a lot of work
to catch up on this weekend.

03:22.758 --> 03:24.275
I'll be lucky if I make
my Spinlates class.

03:24.379 --> 03:25.758
Well, don't work too hard.

03:25.862 --> 03:27.413
You know, my therapist says
that the weekends

03:27.517 --> 03:29.275
are supposed to be
for relaxation.

03:29.379 --> 03:31.620
That's why he can never
see me on Saturday.

03:31.724 --> 03:32.862
Jake! Matt!

03:32.965 --> 03:34.413
So glad I caught you two.
- See you Monday!

03:34.517 --> 03:35.827
- Have a great weekend,
everyone!

03:35.931 --> 03:38.241
- Okay, take care, Kate.
Have a good one, Grace.

03:38.344 --> 03:39.448
Will you two agree
to do a favor for me?

03:39.551 --> 03:43.068
- Oh, um, well, you know, we--
- Matt and I have

03:43.172 --> 03:45.000
very expensive plans that
can't be changed or refunded.

03:45.103 --> 03:47.172
- No, no, no, no.
Come on, guys, of course not.

03:47.275 --> 03:48.931
I would never disrupt
your Friday night.

03:49.034 --> 03:50.793
I need your help on Saturday.

03:50.896 --> 03:53.793
I got a new antique-style
grandfather clock,

03:53.896 --> 03:56.103
and I need some assistance
in moving it.

03:56.206 --> 03:59.827
both: Okay.

03:59.931 --> 04:02.379
- Great, it should really
only take a couple of hours.

04:02.482 --> 04:04.379
I just emailed you
my private address.

04:04.482 --> 04:06.413
Don't share it.

04:06.517 --> 04:08.379
And I'll see you guys tomorrow!

04:08.482 --> 04:09.517
Wear your dungarees!

04:09.620 --> 04:12.206
- What the hell are dungarees?

04:12.310 --> 04:14.655
- This is going to ruin
my next 24 hours.

04:44.241 --> 04:45.448
They have this new pretzel

04:45.551 --> 04:46.862
that's just a pile
of butter and salt,

04:46.965 --> 04:49.000
but there's no pretzel,

04:49.103 --> 04:51.206

Come on in!

05:06.862 --> 05:07.931
Take your shoes off. Relax.

No, seriously.

Remove your shoes
and put them in

05:10.862 --> 05:13.103
the designated cubbies, please.

05:13.206 --> 05:15.896
This place is probably
really aspiration for you guys,

05:16.000 --> 05:17.793
but if you work hard enough,
one day,

05:17.896 --> 05:19.620
you too could have
a luxury pre-9/11 style

condominium with optional,
built-in shelving.

05:23.137 --> 05:25.379
- Is that the clock?
- Yep, that's the one.

05:25.482 --> 05:27.551
But, uh, before we get to that,

05:27.655 --> 05:29.000
I would love to give
you two the tour.

05:29.103 --> 05:31.448
- Oh--
- No.

05:31.551 --> 05:33.689
- This is the bedroom.

05:33.793 --> 05:36.724
Pretty standard.
Uh, I like to kind of peek out

05:36.827 --> 05:39.068
the windows and spy on
my neighbors here a little bit.

05:39.172 --> 05:41.000
This controls the temperature
in the room for the most part.

05:41.103 --> 05:42.551
I'm sure you guys are familiar
with that technology.

05:43.655 --> 05:45.689
Where's the bed?

05:45.793 --> 05:48.068
- Don't ask questions
you don't want the answer to.

05:48.172 --> 05:51.206
- And this is my bird room.

05:52.862 --> 05:55.896
Hi.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.896
Yes.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.620
I missed you, too.

06:01.620 --> 06:03.034
- Matt, please don't do that.

06:03.137 --> 06:06.000
You'll confuse them.

06:09.551 --> 06:13.103
And here is the reason
you're here.

06:13.206 --> 06:14.482
Isn't she a beaut?

06:14.586 --> 06:16.413
Wait, it's a--
it's a grandfather clock

06:16.517 --> 06:18.344
so he's a beaut.
You know what, guys,

06:18.448 --> 06:19.517
let's not gender the clock.

06:19.620 --> 06:21.172
Okay?
It's a beaut.

06:21.275 --> 06:24.896
- So where are we moving
this genderless beaut?

06:27.482 --> 06:29.172
- On three--
one, two, lift.

06:29.275 --> 06:30.103
- Good.

06:30.206 --> 06:31.103
Lift with your knees, Matt.

06:31.206 --> 06:32.137
With your knees.

06:32.241 --> 06:33.241
Lift with your knees, please.

06:33.344 --> 06:35.172
Please don't scratch
the leather.

06:35.275 --> 06:36.206

06:41.344 --> 06:43.862
If you guys wanna
get out of the way for a second.

06:43.965 --> 06:44.655
Ooh!

06:44.758 --> 06:46.586
I don't know, it's a--

06:46.689 --> 06:47.448
Slide back in for one second.

06:47.551 --> 06:50.103
I just wanna--here.

06:50.206 --> 06:51.344
Is that it?

06:51.448 --> 06:53.379
I'm watching TV.

06:53.482 --> 06:54.482
What time is it?
I'm not wearing my watch.

06:54.586 --> 06:56.103
Oh, it's 3:30.

06:56.206 --> 06:57.241
Uh, you know what,

06:57.344 --> 06:58.206
it's pretty helpful
to see it in context.

06:58.310 --> 06:59.793
Do, like, you're just--

06:59.896 --> 07:02.172
it's, like, a dinner party,
and you're a little tired,

07:02.275 --> 07:05.758
and you're a vegetarian.
You guys are just chatting.

07:05.862 --> 07:07.379
- It's nice being here
at this dinner party,

07:07.482 --> 07:09.344
but I guess I'm just
a little tired.

07:09.448 --> 07:10.655
- I can't eat any of
the meat stuff.

07:10.758 --> 07:12.137
- Mmm.
So you guys came over

07:12.241 --> 07:13.551
to watch the game.

07:13.655 --> 07:14.758
Your team won, your team lost,

07:14.862 --> 07:17.137
but it's just sort of
something to talk about.

07:17.241 --> 07:19.689
- Well, it's great news
that my team won the game.

07:19.793 --> 07:20.620
- Well, my team lost so I'm mad.

07:20.724 --> 07:23.689
- Uh, I'm on the fence.

07:23.793 --> 07:25.517
Man, I'm pissed my team lost!

07:25.620 --> 07:26.482
- So you're at
a breakfast party,

07:26.586 --> 07:28.551
and you both want
the last biscuit.

07:28.655 --> 07:31.862
- Oh, I thought that I--
did you want it?

07:31.965 --> 07:33.758
- I mean, I've had a couple,
but I thought--

07:33.862 --> 07:35.379
- I haven't had
any biscuits thus far.

07:35.482 --> 07:38.551
- You've been waiting up
all night for him to come home.

07:38.655 --> 07:39.931
- It's 2:00 a.m.
and you smell like perfume.

07:40.034 --> 07:40.896
What the hell?

07:41.000 --> 07:42.413
I got it!

07:42.517 --> 07:43.931
Okay, lift on three.

07:44.034 --> 07:45.413
One, two, lift.

07:45.517 --> 07:46.413
Yup, come on this way.

07:46.517 --> 07:47.413
Jake, with your knees, buddy.

07:47.517 --> 07:48.793
Turn it, turn it, turn it.

07:48.896 --> 07:49.931
Keep going--please be careful,
Matt, for God's sake.

07:50.034 --> 07:52.034
Yeah.

07:53.034 --> 07:55.310
Perfect.

07:55.413 --> 07:57.137
Sometimes, you gotta go
all the way around the world

07:57.241 --> 07:58.413
to realize that home...

07:58.517 --> 07:59.551
Is the only place you wanna be.

07:59.655 --> 08:01.379
- I got a splinter.

08:01.482 --> 08:02.310
- Thank you guys so much.
- Ow!

08:02.413 --> 08:03.793
- I really appreciate it.
- God.

08:03.896 --> 08:06.137
- Thank you for helping me out.
As a thank you,

08:06.241 --> 08:07.172
you have to let me take you
to dinner.

08:07.275 --> 08:08.896
- Oh, that's really nice
of you to offer,

08:09.000 --> 08:09.862
but I'm not really
much of an eater.

08:09.965 --> 08:10.931
- Yeah,
I just don't eat. Don't eat.

08:11.034 --> 08:12.896
- Okay,
I am taking you guys to dinner

08:13.000 --> 08:14.448
and I will not take no
for an answer.

08:14.551 --> 08:15.793
Plus, you gotta get

08:15.896 --> 08:17.103
your parking validated.

08:17.206 --> 08:18.137
Not cheap.

08:18.241 --> 08:19.172
I'll grab your shoes
from the cubbies.

08:23.586 --> 08:24.413
both: Fuck!

08:27.068 --> 08:28.586
- By the way, this restaurant

08:28.689 --> 08:29.896
is owned by Hampton DeVille,

08:30.000 --> 08:31.517
so if you guys brought
your employee IDs,

08:31.620 --> 08:33.172
we'll get some free apps.

08:33.275 --> 08:34.413
All righty. Here we go!

08:34.517 --> 08:35.517
Don't sue me.

08:35.620 --> 08:36.517
Hey, Katherine!

08:37.965 --> 08:39.344
- I'll be right back
to get your order.

08:39.448 --> 08:40.448
Giddy up!

08:40.551 --> 08:42.517
Giddy up.

08:42.620 --> 08:44.310
Isn't this place fun, you guys?

08:46.758 --> 08:48.103
It's depressing

08:48.206 --> 08:50.000
that all these employees
have to work on the weekend.

08:50.103 --> 08:51.379
- We're working right now.
At least they're getting paid.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.344
- This place looks like somebody
held a gun to it and said,

08:55.448 --> 08:56.758
"Have fun or else."

08:56.862 --> 08:58.655
- I can't believe these people
haven't killed themselves yet.

08:58.758 --> 09:00.344
Their will to live
is astounding.

09:00.448 --> 09:01.379
- Everyone in here looks like

09:01.482 --> 09:03.517
they just went through
a divorce.

09:03.620 --> 09:05.068
- Oh, my God! Look.

09:05.172 --> 09:08.275
It's Kate, and
a sexy, male companion friend.

09:08.379 --> 09:09.379
Hey!

09:09.482 --> 09:10.931
- Fuck.

09:11.034 --> 09:12.482
Matt, Jake, John.

09:12.586 --> 09:15.310
Why are you all here together?

09:15.413 --> 09:17.310
Are you working on
the Jenson project without me?

09:17.413 --> 09:19.551
- No, no, no, no.
Jake and Matt offered to help me

09:19.655 --> 09:20.689
move my grandfather clock,

09:20.793 --> 09:22.862
and then we just kind of
mutually decided

09:22.965 --> 09:24.724
to go to dinner together.

09:24.827 --> 09:26.896
Kate, who's your companion?

09:27.000 --> 09:28.896
- Oh, uh, um,

09:29.000 --> 09:30.241
that's Sonnet.

09:30.344 --> 09:32.379
- Hi, I'm Sonnet!
- Sonnet, shh!

09:32.482 --> 09:33.586
- Well, golly.

09:33.689 --> 09:35.379
Looks like you partners
all know each other.

09:35.482 --> 09:38.862
What do you say we hitch
these wagon wheels together?

09:45.448 --> 09:48.965
- Well, Sonnet, I'm honored
to meet the man in Kate's life.

09:49.068 --> 09:50.758
You must be
a very special person.

09:50.862 --> 09:51.931
- Oh! No.

09:52.034 --> 09:53.620
She ordered me through Summen.

09:53.724 --> 09:55.586
It's an online companion service
for executive ladies who just--

09:55.689 --> 09:57.931
- Sonnet! Shh! Shh!

09:58.034 --> 09:59.655
Shh.

09:59.758 --> 10:02.689
We met at church.
- Oh!

10:02.793 --> 10:03.689
- Okay. No appetizers.

10:03.793 --> 10:05.413
No desserts. Just entrees.

10:05.517 --> 10:06.517
And maybe I'll still have time
to get a haircut before

10:06.620 --> 10:08.413
we go to Grace's party.

10:08.517 --> 10:09.620
- You folks ready to order?

10:09.724 --> 10:10.965
- Slow down there, Sheriff.

10:11.068 --> 10:12.103
I think we need at least
15 minutes to figure out

10:12.206 --> 10:14.655
our appetizer strategy,
but in the meantime,

10:14.758 --> 10:17.275
let's do a jug of milk
for the table.

10:17.379 --> 10:18.827
- Absolutely.

10:18.931 --> 10:20.344
- A little on the warmer side,
too, please.

10:20.448 --> 10:21.344
- Hot milk.

10:25.517 --> 10:28.034
- Mm-mmm!
- This is pure protein goodness.

10:28.137 --> 10:29.620
Isn't this place great, Kate?
- No.

10:29.724 --> 10:32.034
And the fact
that you suggested it

10:32.137 --> 10:34.068
is gonna deduct two stars
from your rating.

10:34.172 --> 10:35.862
The best you can do now
is a three.

10:35.965 --> 10:38.379
- Oh, man. Not my rating.

10:38.482 --> 10:39.620
- Who wants to make it better
with cheddar?

10:39.724 --> 10:41.034
- Yeah, I'll do that.

10:41.137 --> 10:43.724
- Isn't your dinner
cheesy enough?

10:43.827 --> 10:45.379
- I'm sorry you have to do this.

10:45.482 --> 10:46.724
- Spur my side, cowboy!

10:46.827 --> 10:48.137
It's my pleasure.

10:48.241 --> 10:49.655
- You don't have to talk
like that for our sake.

10:49.758 --> 10:50.724
Yes, I do.

10:50.827 --> 10:52.724
They make us wear body cams.

10:55.827 --> 10:58.310
Everything's better with
a little more cheddar!

10:58.413 --> 11:00.068
- You can tell this is

11:00.172 --> 11:02.034
a Hampton DeVille restaurant
because all the waiters act like

11:02.137 --> 11:03.448
they're in a hostage situation.

11:03.551 --> 11:05.793
- Mmm!

11:05.896 --> 11:07.000
Best part about
this restaurant?

11:07.103 --> 11:08.965
- Mm-hmm?
- Unlimited milk refills.

11:09.068 --> 11:10.448
- John, I think milk
is supposed to be for kids.

11:10.551 --> 11:13.275
- Milk boy!

11:13.379 --> 11:14.034
- Jesus Christ.

11:14.137 --> 11:15.551
Look at this poor fuck.

11:15.655 --> 11:17.931
- Slow down, partner.

11:18.034 --> 11:21.137
This is your fourth refill.

11:22.862 --> 11:26.000
Is it just me,
or is the milk boy

11:26.103 --> 11:28.034
a little mouthy tonight?

11:28.137 --> 11:30.275
I know my limits, pal. Thanks.

11:35.034 --> 11:37.379
- We need to leave.
How are we still here?

11:37.482 --> 11:38.965
- Because both of us have
an underlying cowardice

11:39.068 --> 11:39.965
that guides every decision
of our lives.

11:40.068 --> 11:42.931
- Oh. Yeah.
- Great news, everybody!

11:43.034 --> 11:46.000
All you partners just consumed
more than 3,000 calories!

11:46.103 --> 11:47.517
- Why would you tell us that?

11:47.620 --> 11:48.482
- It's part of
an FDA settlement.

11:48.586 --> 11:51.482
Whoa-oh!

11:51.586 --> 11:53.758
That cow only moves when there's
a birthday in the barn!

11:53.862 --> 11:54.620
- Oh, no,
there must be some mistake--

11:54.724 --> 11:56.517
- It's my birthday!

11:56.620 --> 11:58.827
- Hell yeah!
Birthday! I love it!

11:58.931 --> 12:00.379
Whoop!

12:00.482 --> 12:02.793
Well, thank you, Sheriff.

12:02.896 --> 12:05.275
- Oh, that's why
John is acting so weird.

12:05.379 --> 12:06.620
It's his birthday.

12:07.862 --> 12:09.724
- Watch.

You wanna move that?
Sorry. Yup. Thanks, Sonnet.

13:10.551 --> 13:11.896
How great was that song,
by the way?

13:12.000 --> 13:14.413
It's so beautiful,
yet so frantic.

13:14.517 --> 13:16.448
- John, happy birthday.
This is crazy.

13:16.551 --> 13:17.689
Oh. It's not actually
my birthday.

13:17.793 --> 13:19.206
Don't be silly.

13:19.310 --> 13:21.172
The Texas sized banana split
boat is my favorite thing,

13:21.275 --> 13:22.517
and that's the only way
to get it.

13:22.620 --> 13:23.655
I do this all the time.

13:23.758 --> 13:24.689
- Wait, so they know
it's not your birthday?

13:24.793 --> 13:25.931
- Mm-hmm!

13:26.034 --> 13:27.586
But they have to do it
if someone asks.

13:27.689 --> 13:28.931
It's company policy.

13:29.034 --> 13:30.689
- Jesus Christ.

13:30.793 --> 13:31.827
- Get in there!

13:31.931 --> 13:33.172
- Mm, mm, bananas.
- Oh, yeah.

13:33.275 --> 13:34.310
Whoa, hold up, hold up.

13:34.413 --> 13:35.724
Okay.

13:39.172 --> 13:41.586
- I went to fucking Julliard.

13:41.689 --> 13:44.448
- So, what do you say
we keep this party going?

13:44.551 --> 13:47.068
There is an awesome bar
right next to the Sephora.

13:47.172 --> 13:48.310
- No, thanks.
I think we're just gonna

13:48.413 --> 13:49.413
call it our own night.
- Oh.

13:49.517 --> 13:50.413
- Oh, my God,
I used to work at Sephora.

13:50.517 --> 13:51.896
- So you two are
definitely coming.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.482
And I know...

13:53.586 --> 13:55.172
- We have to get to Grace's
party before Daphne leaves.

13:55.275 --> 13:56.379
- Let's just say thanks
and good night

13:56.482 --> 13:58.103
and obviously do not mention
Grace's party.

13:58.206 --> 13:59.620
- Got it.
I'll make up an excuse.

13:59.724 --> 14:01.655
I did improv in college.
- Stop bringing that up.

14:01.758 --> 14:03.551
- You guys in?
- Yeah, we would love to come,

14:03.655 --> 14:05.689
it's just that
we have to get going to...

14:05.793 --> 14:08.862
Um...
uh...

14:08.965 --> 14:11.413
Uh...
Think of something.

14:11.517 --> 14:13.103
What could I be going to?
A party.

14:13.206 --> 14:14.896
Oh, Grace's party!
No, don't say Grace's party.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.862
Use your brain to think
of something--Grace's party.

14:16.965 --> 14:18.275
No, not that.
Grace's party.

14:18.379 --> 14:20.758
Grace's party.

14:20.862 --> 14:22.551
Grace's party.

14:32.448 --> 14:35.172
- Fuck.
I mean, hi.

14:37.655 --> 14:39.172
- Mm-hmm.
Yum-yum.

14:39.275 --> 14:40.275
There she is.

14:40.379 --> 14:41.206
Good.
Food is up!

14:41.310 --> 14:43.241
So, everyone dig in, okay,

14:43.344 --> 14:44.862
before the cheese congeals.

14:44.965 --> 14:47.413
- Why the fuck would you
bring John and Kate to my house?

14:47.517 --> 14:49.206
Did you find out about
that thing I did to you

14:49.310 --> 14:50.344
and now you're getting revenge?

14:50.448 --> 14:51.413
- This is totally Matt's fault.

14:51.517 --> 14:52.586
Now, if you'll excuse me,

14:52.689 --> 14:54.827
I'm gonna go have
a terrible time.

14:54.931 --> 14:57.793
- I am so, so sorry.

14:57.896 --> 15:00.103
Anyway, is Daphne still here?

15:01.172 --> 15:03.275
- Yes.

15:03.379 --> 15:04.965
You should go talk to her.

15:05.068 --> 15:06.586
But...

15:07.827 --> 15:08.862
Mm.

15:08.965 --> 15:10.862
- Yeah, well,
I don't know it that's--okay.

15:10.965 --> 15:13.655
- Okay, never mind,
your hair just sucks.

15:13.758 --> 15:15.655
Just please be normal.

15:15.758 --> 15:17.241
- Got it.

15:17.344 --> 15:18.241
- Please.
- Hiya, Grace.

15:18.344 --> 15:20.482
Listen,
I hope you don't feel awkward

15:20.586 --> 15:22.068
about not inviting me
to your party.

15:22.172 --> 15:24.413
- I don't.
- Seriously, I...I get it.

15:24.517 --> 15:27.448
Office John would not be
a lot of fun at a party.

15:27.551 --> 15:31.724
But this...is weekend John.

15:36.241 --> 15:39.034
- Would weekend John like
a drink?

15:39.137 --> 15:41.137
- Yes, please,
I will take a milk.

15:41.241 --> 15:43.344
- I curate
an emerging artists series,

15:43.448 --> 15:45.413
which is basically
a fancy way of saying

15:45.517 --> 15:47.068
"garbage my arty friends make."

15:47.172 --> 15:48.517
But...

15:48.620 --> 15:50.275
- What about you? I know
you work at Hampton-DeVille.

15:50.379 --> 15:52.689
- Yeah, I'm a junior executive
in training,

15:52.793 --> 15:53.896
which is just
a fancy way of saying

15:54.000 --> 15:57.379
that I don't know what
I'm doing with my life.

15:57.482 --> 15:58.517
Come on.

15:58.620 --> 15:59.965
I bet it's more interesting than

16:00.068 --> 16:01.275
you're giving yourself
credit for.

16:01.379 --> 16:02.517
Walk me through your day,
like, step by step.

16:02.620 --> 16:05.241
- Okay...

16:05.344 --> 16:06.586
I get to work at, like, 9:00.

16:06.689 --> 16:09.482
And from 9:00 to 11:00,
I answer emails.

16:09.586 --> 16:12.413
And then I go to a meeting,

16:12.517 --> 16:16.172
where...I talk about emails.

16:16.275 --> 16:18.965
And then I have lunch,

16:19.068 --> 16:23.206
where I typically eat at my desk
and answer emails.

16:23.310 --> 16:26.103
- Emails.

16:26.206 --> 16:27.172
Emails. Emails.

16:27.275 --> 16:28.655
Your entire life
is answering emails.

16:28.758 --> 16:29.862
BCC. Emails. CC.
Answer the email!

16:29.965 --> 16:31.517
Answer the emails.
Answer it! Reply all!

16:31.620 --> 16:32.793
Emails.
- You're a little boy

16:32.896 --> 16:34.103
inside of a man
who answers emails

16:34.206 --> 16:35.551
for a living.
Answer the email!

16:35.655 --> 16:37.206
- I mean, there's all
different types of emails,

16:37.310 --> 16:40.068
and I, you know, put 'em in
different boxes to organize 'em

16:40.172 --> 16:41.103
so that I can keep track--
- Yeah.

16:41.206 --> 16:42.448
- The thing is,
it's a good job for me.

16:42.551 --> 16:43.827
- Right, yeah.
- For me, right now,

16:43.931 --> 16:44.827
it's a good job, and then
at the end of the day...

16:44.931 --> 16:47.896
- Mm-hmm.
- I...

16:48.000 --> 16:50.034
answer emails.
- Right.

16:50.137 --> 16:52.241
That's quite a day.

16:52.344 --> 16:54.448
Why are you wearing sweatpants?

16:54.551 --> 16:56.068
- I don't want to talk about it.

16:58.206 --> 17:00.034
- Oh, hey, Kate.
How are you doing?

17:00.137 --> 17:03.310
- Well, I'm an adult executive

17:03.413 --> 17:05.275
at what appears to be
a college party.

17:05.379 --> 17:06.344
- Where's your date?

17:06.448 --> 17:07.344
- I fired him.

17:07.448 --> 17:08.724
- Oh, I'm sorry.

17:08.827 --> 17:10.620
- Don't be--I had a Groupon
for him, anyways.

17:10.724 --> 17:13.517
I'm actually out here
hiding from John.

17:13.620 --> 17:16.034
I've never seen a grown-up
consume so much dairy.

17:16.137 --> 17:18.275
- He has the diet of a
five-year-old with osteoporosis.

17:18.379 --> 17:21.482
- It's ridiculous.

17:21.586 --> 17:24.172
- You want to hit this?
- Kate, you smoke weed?

17:24.275 --> 17:25.068
- Oh, don't be so surprised.

17:25.172 --> 17:27.241
It's the weekend.

17:27.344 --> 17:28.344
And I'm a human being.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.000
- Aw, shit.

17:31.068 --> 17:32.034
- ♪ Smoke weed

17:32.137 --> 17:34.000
♪ Get crazy

17:34.103 --> 17:35.344
♪ Gettin' crazy

17:35.448 --> 17:36.827
♪ Smoke weed

17:40.068 --> 17:41.482
- Well, I feel a little better.

17:41.586 --> 17:44.137
- It's slightly more tolerable
to be at this party right now.

17:44.241 --> 17:45.517
- And here's my bedroom.
- Wow.

17:45.620 --> 17:47.758
- As you can see, there's
nothing notable about it.

17:47.862 --> 17:49.517
- Huh.
- Okay, that's it, tour's over.

17:49.620 --> 17:52.103
- Wow.
Great, concise tour, Grace.

17:52.206 --> 17:53.655
- I learned a lot.

17:53.758 --> 17:55.689
You know, since we're getting
to know each other

17:55.793 --> 17:57.275
a bit out of the office,
here's a little personal tidbit

17:57.379 --> 18:00.862
about me:
my second week at Yale,

18:00.965 --> 18:05.344
my roommate hanged himself
with my bed sheets.

18:05.448 --> 18:09.310
And to this day,
I do not sleep in a bed.

18:09.413 --> 18:13.172
- Wow, that's quite a tidbit.

18:13.275 --> 18:14.103
- Doug Feldman.

18:14.206 --> 18:15.344
- ♪ We were...

18:15.448 --> 18:18.103
- Do you know what I love
about dancing?

18:18.206 --> 18:19.034
- What?
- It makes you feel like

18:19.137 --> 18:21.310
you're experiencing something,

18:21.413 --> 18:23.034
even though
it's totally pointless.

18:23.137 --> 18:24.517
- Yeah, my body feels like
it's having a good time

18:24.620 --> 18:26.827
right now, even though
I'm absolutely not.

18:26.931 --> 18:28.931
- Oh, no way!

18:29.034 --> 18:31.206
Is this a virtual reality
thingamajig?

18:31.310 --> 18:33.482
- Yeah, you should try it.

18:33.586 --> 18:36.103
You can leave this party behind
and enter a new reality.

18:36.206 --> 18:38.344
I think we'd all
like to see that.

18:38.448 --> 18:39.724
- Could you hold my milk?

18:41.965 --> 18:44.448
Ooh.
Oh, baby!

18:44.551 --> 18:45.689
Whoa!

18:45.793 --> 18:47.517
What?

18:47.620 --> 18:48.862
Oh, my God, that's my arm.

18:48.965 --> 18:50.000
Grace, is this my arm?

18:50.103 --> 18:51.000
- Think I'm gonna get
a restraining order

18:51.103 --> 18:53.482
against weekend John.

18:53.586 --> 18:54.620
- Get out of here.
What is that, a bee?

18:54.724 --> 18:56.103
Or like a bee--

18:56.206 --> 18:57.172
That's like a full beehive
or something like that.

18:57.275 --> 18:59.137
- How'd it go with Daphne?

19:03.206 --> 19:04.586
Should have gotten that haircut.

19:04.689 --> 19:07.344
Or developed a more
dynamic personality

19:07.448 --> 19:08.724
over the last 29 years.

19:08.827 --> 19:11.275
- Help me, please.
I-I'm on a cliff right now.

19:11.379 --> 19:13.689
G-Grace?
Grace, I'm on a cliff!

19:19.551 --> 19:21.896
- Well, at least he didn't puke
in my virtual reality headset.

19:24.655 --> 19:26.931
- Okay, party's over.
Everyone out!

19:32.344 --> 19:33.551
- So, I actually had fun

19:33.655 --> 19:35.344
not having fun with you
at this party.

19:35.448 --> 19:36.551
- Yeah, me too.

19:36.655 --> 19:37.620
Do you want to share an Uber?

19:37.724 --> 19:40.068
- Oh, no, thanks.
I've got a ride.

19:43.206 --> 19:44.448
Don't even tell me your name.

19:44.551 --> 19:47.068
You, in the back.
I'm driving.

19:48.620 --> 19:49.827
- How do I get that job?

19:49.931 --> 19:51.862
This was a total waste
of a Saturday.

19:51.965 --> 19:53.793
I'm gonna have to really
make up for this on Sunday.

19:53.896 --> 19:55.586
- Not a chance.
Sundays are worthless.

19:55.689 --> 19:57.172
Spend the entire day
dreading Monday.

19:57.275 --> 19:58.862
You'll be back at work
before you even know...

19:58.965 --> 20:00.068
What happened with John
the other night?

20:00.172 --> 20:01.655
- He passed out,
and I couldn't get him

20:01.758 --> 20:03.034
out of my house
till Sunday afternoon.

20:03.137 --> 20:05.517
Now he wants to take me
to some place called Milk Barn

20:05.620 --> 20:07.137
for a thank-you dinner
this weekend.

20:07.241 --> 20:09.586
- Oh, God, Grace, no.

20:09.689 --> 20:11.000
- Don't worry.
I handled it.

20:11.103 --> 20:13.655
If anybody asks,
I'm doing Habitat for Humanity

20:13.758 --> 20:17.965
every Saturday and Sunday
until either John or I dies.

20:18.068 --> 20:21.137
- Hey, guys.
Great weekend, huh?

20:21.241 --> 20:22.655
Too bad it's Monday again.

20:22.758 --> 20:23.931
- Yeah,
guess now that we're friends,

20:24.034 --> 20:26.275
you can't boss us around
anymore, huh?

20:30.344 --> 20:31.827
- Matt.

20:31.931 --> 20:35.275
It seems like you think
you're talking to weekend John.

20:35.379 --> 20:37.862
But this is office John.

20:40.068 --> 20:42.931
And he is not
your fucking friend.

20:45.931 --> 20:47.827
- Hey, Kate, how's it going?
- Nothing has changed

20:47.931 --> 20:49.689
between us.
- That's cool.

20:49.793 --> 20:51.448
And it doesn't hurt my feelings.

21:04.896 --> 21:08.275
- ♪ The American dream

21:11.620 --> 21:12.448
- ♪ I love you Charles

21:12.551 --> 21:14.758
