Through this anointing, may the lord,
in his love and mercy,

01:02.061 --> 01:04.214
help you with the grace
of the holy spirit.

01:06.974 --> 01:09.823
May the lord, who frees you from sin,
save you and raise you up.

01:13.898 --> 01:16.371
Through this anointing, may the lord,
in his love and mercy,

01:16.531 --> 01:18.373
help you with the grace
of the holy spirit.

01:22.021 --> 01:24.921
May the lord, who frees you from sin,
save you and raise you up.

01:43.083 --> 01:45.276
Yes, I'd like to report
two men shot to death lying

01:45.396 --> 01:48.655
in the back of a pickup truck under
the sixth street bridge and Anderson.

02:00.801 --> 02:03.459
- Morning, chief Johnson.
- So, what's all this?

02:03.579 --> 02:06.671
Two Tijuana police officers
shot to death in this pickup.

02:08.521 --> 02:11.078
Jacinto Gonzales, Carlos Gomez.

02:11.749 --> 02:14.326
Is that why you called
priority homicide, commander?

02:14.446 --> 02:18.224
Dead foreign police officers can
only be investigated by "the elite"?

02:18.539 --> 02:20.894
I had nothing to do with
the article in the times today

02:21.054 --> 02:22.937
referring to PHD as "elite,"

02:23.097 --> 02:24.660
and you can tell flynn `cause

02:24.780 --> 02:27.143
I've never used the word "elite"
to describe you.

02:27.263 --> 02:28.511
Okay, okay, okay.

02:28.631 --> 02:29.363
Come.

02:31.376 --> 02:34.157
We're gonna have to respond
to that article in the times,

02:34.574 --> 02:36.593
but everything Ramos wrote was trash.

02:36.713 --> 02:38.541
Chief pope
seems to be taking it seriously.

02:38.661 --> 02:40.872
He wants me in his office an hour ago.

02:41.633 --> 02:43.887
Why is the coroner's investigator
just getting here now?

02:44.007 --> 02:45.978
Lots of dead people on monday.

02:48.320 --> 02:51.299
And if no one's touched the bodies,
how do we know their I. D's?

02:51.459 --> 02:54.886
Wallets, passports,
badges were all laid out in plain view.

02:55.046 --> 02:57.306
Also in the driver's seat, guns.

02:57.741 --> 02:59.511
This isn't the crime scene.

02:59.631 --> 03:01.647
So, wait. Somebody
drove the bodies here?

03:01.924 --> 03:03.598
Where's this vehicle from?

03:03.718 --> 03:06.475
The vehicle is registered
to a San Diego address.

03:06.595 --> 03:09.754
The police down there say the owner,
a Mr. Raul Llamas,

03:09.874 --> 03:13.568
didn't even know the vehicle was stolen
till they told him this morning.

03:13.888 --> 03:18.182
So two Tijuana police officers murdered
elsewhere are driven underneath

03:18.444 --> 03:21.941
a bridge in Los Angeles and
abandoned in a stolen pickup truck.

03:22.061 --> 03:24.198
That's so strange. Who found the bodies?

03:24.318 --> 03:26.560
The guy who called it in
didn't identify himself,

03:26.680 --> 03:29.909
but the cellphone's registered
to a father Chris Donahue.

03:30.029 --> 03:31.048
Oh, great.

03:31.439 --> 03:34.634
What was father Donahue doing in a place
like this at 6:00 in the morning?

03:34.754 --> 03:38.045
I have no idea, but there's
a catholic church four blocks away.

03:38.165 --> 03:39.806
Our lady of the saints.

03:40.317 --> 03:41.140
Chief.

03:41.693 --> 03:43.597
I think we got something here.

03:48.631 --> 03:50.608
And it's seriously weird.

03:51.244 --> 03:54.654
Now we got a whole list
of seriously weird stuff going.

04:02.113 --> 04:04.323
Just another drug murder in Los Angeles.

04:04.443 --> 04:06.165
You recognize these bracelets,
detective?

04:06.325 --> 04:08.451
It's related to the Ochoa cartel.

04:08.571 --> 04:10.478
All their people wear them.
It means that

04:10.598 --> 04:12.531
our victims are probably dirty cops.

04:12.810 --> 04:15.080
Both men dead
about six to nine hours and

04:15.200 --> 04:18.019
showing multiple gunshot wounds
from what looks like a.45.

04:18.139 --> 04:19.512
Okay, thank you.

04:20.608 --> 04:22.569
Gentlemen. Thank you so much.

04:24.444 --> 04:26.118
Okay, detective Sanchez,

04:26.238 --> 04:29.275
let's let the Tijuana police know that
they've lost two of their officers.

04:29.395 --> 04:31.967
Maybe they could tell us how
they got here in the first place.

04:32.087 --> 04:35.299
Lieutenant Flynn, let's get
a dope dog to go over this truck.

04:35.419 --> 04:38.489
See if anything floats its boat.
After which, lieutenant Tao,

04:38.609 --> 04:40.248
if you could take it to the print shed?

04:40.368 --> 04:42.619
Thank you. Sergeant Gabriel,
I want "shots fired" reports

04:42.779 --> 04:44.835
from L.A. County for last night.
I need...

04:44.955 --> 04:47.059
a crime scene in the very worst way.

04:48.096 --> 04:48.874
Chief.

04:49.429 --> 04:50.376
Look here.

05:00.970 --> 05:01.946
Olive oil.

05:03.824 --> 05:06.508
Detective Daniels,
that priest that called this in,

05:06.628 --> 05:09.443
he didn't just find the bodies,
he also performed last rites.

05:09.563 --> 05:12.282
I'd like him in my office,
please, posthaste.

05:19.463 --> 05:22.568
Father Donahue doesn't have to talk
to you if he doesn't want to.

05:22.688 --> 05:25.034
And when you want to interact
with the catholic church,

05:25.154 --> 05:27.082
you need to go through a deputy chief.

05:27.632 --> 05:29.082
I am a deputy chief.

05:29.242 --> 05:32.177
Yeah, I mean, you know, a real,
grown-up deputy chief with

05:32.297 --> 05:34.170
management and administrative duties.

05:34.330 --> 05:38.083
Like Dennis Murdoch, who is L.A.P.D.'s
liaison with the archdiocese.

05:38.482 --> 05:40.335
Have you read the times today?

05:40.591 --> 05:42.176
This article by Ramos?

05:42.296 --> 05:44.060
I glanced through it, yes.

05:44.974 --> 05:48.108
- Anything leap out at you?
- He misspelled my middle name.

05:49.488 --> 05:50.702
What about this?

05:50.822 --> 05:51.541
Here.

05:52.295 --> 05:53.017
Here.

05:53.442 --> 05:56.658
"Deputy chief Brenda Lee Johnson
confesses "that 90% of the time,

05:56.778 --> 05:58.370
"priority homicide division

05:58.490 --> 06:00.364
is deployed by her superiors

06:00.484 --> 06:03.222
in an attempt to anticipate
media coverage."

06:03.342 --> 06:05.378
Did you actually say this?!

06:05.498 --> 06:07.382
Of course not!
He took my words out of context.

06:07.502 --> 06:09.952
You accused me of allowing
the press to run this department!

06:10.072 --> 06:12.107
Wait a minute, Will.
Now, wait a minute.

06:12.552 --> 06:14.431
The main point of this article

06:14.551 --> 06:17.601
is that phd handles more
white murder victims

06:17.721 --> 06:20.133
than robbery/homicide,
and that has nothing to do with me.

06:20.293 --> 06:21.758
That's how you assign cases.

06:21.878 --> 06:23.894
In addition to which,
having a reporter popping

06:24.014 --> 06:25.979
in and out of my division
was your idea, not mine.

06:26.099 --> 06:28.592
You want to know what else
was my idea? You!

06:28.712 --> 06:29.517
You...

06:29.677 --> 06:30.848
Were my idea.

06:30.968 --> 06:33.479
Priority homicide was my idea.

06:33.639 --> 06:36.418
And so imagine how much fun
it's been explaining your comments

06:36.538 --> 06:38.297
to angry members
of the police commission,

06:38.417 --> 06:41.320
all of whom are now demanding
that I dismantle your division.

06:41.480 --> 06:43.792
Do you understand what that means?

06:43.912 --> 06:45.903
- Yes. Yes, of course.
- Come in.

06:46.498 --> 06:49.593
We need to, I need to explain
things better to...

06:49.713 --> 06:51.289
No, no, no. No!

06:53.153 --> 06:55.261
I admit we need to talk
to this asshole, Ramos,

06:55.381 --> 06:56.897
because there's a big "part 1"

06:57.017 --> 06:59.979
under the headline of this article,
and we don't want part 2,

07:00.099 --> 07:02.086
which comes out next week,
to end as badly.

07:02.206 --> 07:05.316
But the time for simple explanations
has come and gone.

07:05.774 --> 07:08.992
L.A.P.D. needs to get ahead
of this story, chief Johnson.

07:09.248 --> 07:13.102
Priority homicide has established
the efficacy of team investigation.

07:13.955 --> 07:17.516
We need to apply that lesson
to the rest of our force structure.

07:17.636 --> 07:20.193
And translated,
that means what, exactly?

07:21.540 --> 07:24.447
Priority homicide has run its course.
It's over. It's done.

07:24.607 --> 07:26.040
I'm shutting it down.

07:28.320 --> 07:29.125
What?

07:32.493 --> 07:34.040
Because of this story?

07:34.807 --> 07:35.624
Really?

07:38.646 --> 07:41.132
What's gonna happen to my detectives?
And, and when?

07:41.252 --> 07:44.008
When? You want to know when?
Now! Today!

07:44.528 --> 07:46.381
By the time
Ramos gets here this evening,

07:46.501 --> 07:48.383
the commander
and I will have reconfigured

07:48.503 --> 07:50.078
L.A.P.D.'s various homicide units

07:50.198 --> 07:52.621
in such a way that they will
withstand both criticism

07:52.741 --> 07:56.229
from the police commission
as well as any further media scrutiny.

07:56.647 --> 07:59.100
You will retain your rank and salary,

07:59.220 --> 08:02.365
but you will no longer be in charge
of anything called priority homicide.

08:02.485 --> 08:04.066
And for now, that's it.

08:05.543 --> 08:06.830
You're dismissed.

08:22.814 --> 08:25.268
Chief Murdoch has spoke
with the archdiocese.

08:25.388 --> 08:28.476
They say father Donahue will call us
when he has a minute.

08:31.283 --> 08:32.011
Okay.

08:33.160 --> 08:34.835
Well, we got a minute.

08:36.292 --> 08:38.413
What do we know about him,
father Donahue?

08:38.533 --> 08:41.645
Well, he has a small church in one
of the poorer sections of the city.

08:41.765 --> 08:43.226
Our lady of the saints.

08:43.346 --> 08:46.531
Runs it alone, and he's been questioned
several times by immigration officials.

08:46.651 --> 08:49.560
They believe he provides
sanctuary for illegals.

08:50.897 --> 08:52.789
Sanchez, we hear from Tijuana?

08:53.600 --> 08:57.063
They're sending some comandante
to do their own investigation,

08:57.183 --> 09:00.459
but our victims here,
Jacinto Gonzales and Carlos Gomez,

09:00.808 --> 09:03.249
had no official business here
in Los Angeles.

09:03.369 --> 09:04.842
But they had weapons.

09:06.261 --> 09:08.382
Lieutenant Flynn,
what did our dope dog think?

09:08.733 --> 09:10.190
He was unimpressed, but

09:10.310 --> 09:13.269
there was some dried blood
behind the seats in the truck's cab.

09:13.389 --> 09:16.100
S.I.D.'s still working on matching it up
and isolating fingerprints.

09:16.260 --> 09:18.827
And, we may have something here, chief,

09:19.134 --> 09:21.089
an unresolved "shots fired" report.

09:21.209 --> 09:23.798
Last night at around 3:00 a. m.,
central division responds to

09:23.918 --> 09:27.331
an anonymous call reporting a gunfight
just east of the train station.

09:27.451 --> 09:29.520
Our guys drove through the area,
stopped and talked

09:29.640 --> 09:31.407
to security guards,
didn't find anything.

09:31.567 --> 09:33.492
But all of them admit
to hearing something,

09:33.652 --> 09:36.287
except for the night watchman
at manta chemical company,

09:37.667 --> 09:39.475
a Mateo Hernandez.

09:39.992 --> 09:43.044
Yeah, I, I put a want on him
while you were in with pope.

09:43.204 --> 09:47.096
Now, as it turns out, the address
on his driver's license doesn't exist.

09:47.216 --> 09:49.154
Also, Mateo's 40,

09:49.384 --> 09:51.748
and it says he's supposedly born
here in L.A.,

09:51.868 --> 09:54.579
but his social security number
is only two months old.

09:55.049 --> 09:57.187
- What about vehicle registration?
- He has a car.

09:57.307 --> 09:59.419
He left it at work last night.
Hasn't come back for it.

09:59.539 --> 10:01.821
But we do have two undercovers
watching it right now.

10:03.012 --> 10:07.212
So Mateo Hernandez is either
a deaf illegal immigrant or...

10:07.994 --> 10:09.962
His jobsite is our crime scene.

10:10.397 --> 10:12.723
Let's head over to manta chemical
and have a look-see.

10:12.843 --> 10:13.579
Good.

10:14.598 --> 10:15.582
Oh, and...

10:16.911 --> 10:19.991
Excellent work, everybody...
As always.

10:21.534 --> 10:22.378
Really.

10:23.618 --> 10:25.426
Always really excellent work.

10:27.839 --> 10:28.567
Hey.

10:28.687 --> 10:30.733
Excuse me for interrupting, but D.O.J.,

10:30.853 --> 10:34.053
says you guys made an inquiry
on Mateo Hernandez.

10:34.606 --> 10:37.290
Are you saying that
the FBI has a flag on Mateo?

10:37.410 --> 10:40.164
- Why? Where is he?
- We can't find him just this second.

10:40.583 --> 10:42.372
But this want is a bad thing.

10:44.238 --> 10:46.994
I'm not authorized to tell you
anything about Mateo, except

10:47.114 --> 10:50.035
he's helped us roll up the american side
of some major drug trafficking,

10:50.155 --> 10:52.195
and he is a seriously good guy.

10:53.060 --> 10:54.788
Well, you should come with me, then.

10:54.908 --> 10:57.226
'cause I don't want to cause you
any more problems at work,

10:57.346 --> 11:01.038
but your "seriously good guy" became
my chief suspect in a double homicide.

11:18.566 --> 11:21.531
And I should say that all
of Mateo's paperwork was in order.

11:21.651 --> 11:23.269
We filed it with the government.

11:23.429 --> 11:25.849
That's all right, Mr. Gooding.
We're not from immigration.

11:25.969 --> 11:29.171
And he was a real self-starter, too.
Not just sitting around at night.

11:29.519 --> 11:32.134
He... he burglar-proofed the windows,

11:32.254 --> 11:34.226
he... he fixed our alarms.

11:34.553 --> 11:38.873
He even double-bolted the loading door
at the end of business every day.

11:39.278 --> 11:40.771
And this shelving...

11:41.666 --> 11:43.660
Well, when I left work last night,

11:43.780 --> 11:46.536
this was all in rows
in the center of the room.

11:46.761 --> 11:49.675
I guess Mateo must have moved it up
against the walls.

11:50.014 --> 11:52.391
Oh, and,
this is his desk right over here.

11:53.905 --> 11:54.723
Brenda.

11:57.822 --> 12:00.358
I didn't know him personally,
but from what I was told,

12:00.478 --> 12:03.665
Mateo was just not the kind of guy
who would cause

12:03.785 --> 12:05.763
the sort of problem
you found this morning.

12:06.182 --> 12:07.813
- I disagree.
- Why is that?

12:07.973 --> 12:10.882
Because there's two casings right here
between the shelves.

12:16.125 --> 12:17.224
From a.45.

12:17.843 --> 12:19.319
For those in the know,

12:19.439 --> 12:21.476
nothing better in the handgun biz.

12:29.704 --> 12:30.496
Chief.

12:30.943 --> 12:34.548
Wasn't something like this used
to tape down the tarp on the truck?

12:34.708 --> 12:35.941
- Yes.
- Chief.

12:36.375 --> 12:37.666
Look what I found.

12:37.786 --> 12:40.273
The water in this bucket
has blood in it.

12:41.463 --> 12:44.392
Looks like he tried to mop
the blood up off the floor.

12:44.552 --> 12:46.892
Yeah, but why not wipe
the walls down, too?

12:47.012 --> 12:48.771
Why just put shelves in front of it?

12:48.891 --> 12:50.774
Maybe he, ran out of time.

12:50.894 --> 12:53.419
The lock on this door
has been taken apart from the inside.

12:53.539 --> 12:55.160
Mr. Gooding, when did that happen?

12:55.280 --> 12:57.396
It wasn't like that
when I left yesterday.

12:58.824 --> 13:00.962
So the bodies were already here
when the squad car

13:01.082 --> 13:03.058
pulled up to check
on the "shots fired" report.

13:03.178 --> 13:06.113
Mateo actually went outside
and spoke to the responding officers,

13:06.233 --> 13:07.160
tells them

13:07.280 --> 13:10.329
he doesn't hear a gunfight while
the victims are lying here on the floor?

13:10.449 --> 13:12.862
When the police left, Mateo was afraid
that they might come back,

13:12.982 --> 13:14.598
so he stopped cleaning up,

13:14.718 --> 13:16.841
he pushed the shelves up
against the wall,

13:17.001 --> 13:20.052
he dragged his victims out into
the stolen truck and drives them...

13:20.411 --> 13:21.651
Four blocks...

13:23.261 --> 13:24.552
From his church.

13:25.139 --> 13:28.592
Right, this business about not talking
to the priest is getting ridiculous.

13:28.712 --> 13:30.319
Father Donahue has had his minute.

13:30.439 --> 13:32.815
Chief! Look, just hold on a second.

13:32.975 --> 13:35.189
We can ask father Donahue
to come visit us.

13:35.309 --> 13:38.316
I mean, but walking into his church
and demanding to see him?

13:38.724 --> 13:40.314
That would raise holy hell right now.

13:40.434 --> 13:43.441
I don't think it matters anymore
what kind of hell we raise, honestly.

13:43.744 --> 13:45.582
Okay, okay, chief.

13:46.030 --> 13:48.456
We all read the article
in the times this morning.

13:49.541 --> 13:50.664
We understand.

13:51.838 --> 13:52.960
It's not good.

13:53.433 --> 13:57.298
So now is not the best time to pick
a battle with the catholic church.

13:58.339 --> 14:00.468
Let's fight one Pope at a time.

14:01.050 --> 14:03.621
The fbi's getting ready to fax
over some declassified stuff

14:03.741 --> 14:05.932
- on Mateo to your murder room.
- See?

14:07.351 --> 14:08.959
We got plenty to do.

14:19.664 --> 14:22.388
What's going on? Is pope really
giving you grief about this article?

14:22.508 --> 14:24.444
I thought it had more to do
with his problems...

14:24.564 --> 14:26.533
- I can't talk about this right now.
- Chief,

14:26.653 --> 14:28.793
eight sets of prints inside the pickup.

14:28.913 --> 14:31.166
Two match our victims,
one goes with the prints

14:31.286 --> 14:34.086
we found on the car Mateo left at work,
and five still unknown.

14:34.206 --> 14:35.678
Thank you, lieutenant.

14:36.176 --> 14:37.887
You want to summarize
this for everybody?

14:38.007 --> 14:38.726
Sure.

14:39.375 --> 14:40.549
All right, guys,

14:40.852 --> 14:42.461
Manuel Rivera,

14:43.316 --> 14:45.333
a. k. a. Mateo Hernandez,

14:45.733 --> 14:47.640
used to be a Tijuana comandante.

14:47.916 --> 14:50.559
He refused to back off
as the Ochoa cartel,

14:50.679 --> 14:52.939
when they moved in,
started buying up the local police.

14:53.059 --> 14:55.356
Great. Now the cartels
are coming up here to shoot it out.

14:55.516 --> 14:57.444
No, not Mateo. A year ago,

14:57.564 --> 14:59.889
he abandons Mexico,
he drives up to Los Angeles

15:00.009 --> 15:02.026
with enough evidence to dismantle half

15:02.146 --> 15:04.477
the Ochoa cartel's american
distribution system.

15:04.741 --> 15:08.869
I think your two vics here
were sent by the cartel to kill him.

15:09.639 --> 15:13.309
Okay, how did Gonzales and Gomez
know where to find your informant

15:13.590 --> 15:17.203
if the FBI gave Manuel
this new identity, Mateo?

15:17.323 --> 15:20.158
Well, Mateo's 18-year-old nephew
came to visit last week.

15:20.278 --> 15:23.155
Two days after he goes back to Mexico,
he's murdered.

15:23.275 --> 15:25.184
And Mateo said the cartel
went after his nephew

15:25.304 --> 15:26.843
to find out where we had put him.

15:26.963 --> 15:29.890
Mateo's fbi case officer
talked to Mexican federales.

15:30.175 --> 15:33.769
They said the kid was collateral damage
in a random gunfight between gangs.

15:33.889 --> 15:35.700
What was his name, Mateo's nephew?

15:35.820 --> 15:37.309
Ramon Camacho. Why?

15:37.687 --> 15:40.898
Well, mexico posts all
its morgue photos online,

15:41.574 --> 15:44.905
and I use it sometimes to locate
missing gang members

15:45.065 --> 15:46.240
on their database.

15:51.612 --> 15:54.395
- There he is, Ramon Camacho.
- Are you kidding me?

15:55.026 --> 15:57.094
- Cause of death?
- Blunt-force trauma.

15:57.214 --> 15:58.881
He was beaten, not shot.

15:59.001 --> 16:00.881
Probably tortured for information.

16:01.001 --> 16:03.007
And the investigating officers,

16:03.332 --> 16:05.438
Jacinto Gonzales and Carlos Gomez.

16:06.045 --> 16:07.608
- Our victims.
- Great.

16:07.728 --> 16:10.806
That's one way to get away with murder,
investigate it yourself.

16:11.105 --> 16:13.511
So they grab the kid to find out
where the uncle lives,

16:13.631 --> 16:15.758
they beat him until he talks,
and then they kill him.

16:15.878 --> 16:17.949
And Manuel, a. k. a. Mateo,

16:18.069 --> 16:21.254
hears about this and realizes
that they're coming for him.

16:21.374 --> 16:24.865
So Gonzales and Gomez sneak up
on him somehow at work.

16:24.985 --> 16:28.289
Even have the tape out to put it over
his mouth, same as they did his nephew.

16:28.409 --> 16:31.348
Yeah, but Mateo fought back.
I mean, self-defense.

16:31.468 --> 16:35.738
Or maybe since he knew his identity
had been compromised...

16:37.599 --> 16:40.388
He knew someone was coming,
so he was prepared.

16:40.508 --> 16:42.621
He limited access to only one
entrance door,

16:42.741 --> 16:45.765
so he knew exactly where Gomez
and Gonzales would enter,

16:45.989 --> 16:47.674
almost lying in wait for them.

16:47.794 --> 16:49.550
Is there anything we can do to help?

16:49.865 --> 16:51.818
That depends,
am I finding Mateo so the FBI

16:51.938 --> 16:53.930
can swoop down and
take him away from me?

16:54.050 --> 16:55.917
Not if he committed murder, no.

16:57.638 --> 17:01.688
Lieutenant Tao, that dried blood
on the back of the pickup's cab

17:01.808 --> 17:03.761
I keep bumping on it for some reason.

17:03.881 --> 17:05.486
Would you have S.I.D. determine if

17:05.646 --> 17:07.797
it matches up to any
of our victims, please?

17:07.916 --> 17:09.031
Thank you.

17:11.002 --> 17:12.201
Chief Johnson.

17:13.529 --> 17:14.536
Yes, commander?

17:14.695 --> 17:17.748
Deputy chief Johnson,
this is comandante Martin Vasquez

17:17.907 --> 17:21.253
from the internal-affairs division
of the Tijuana police.

17:21.560 --> 17:23.265
He's here to see about your victims.

17:23.385 --> 17:25.325
Thank you for coming, comandante.

17:25.625 --> 17:27.655
Let me fill you in
on what I know so far.

17:27.775 --> 17:29.078
Gracias, señora.

17:29.562 --> 17:30.660
- Chief.
- Yes?

17:30.780 --> 17:32.650
Listen, i, I know how

17:32.770 --> 17:35.510
things sounded this morning,
but trust me.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.868
I'm, I'm working all this out.

17:39.118 --> 17:39.852
Yeah.

17:39.972 --> 17:41.026
I can tell.

17:42.427 --> 17:44.839
Chief, did it ever occur to you

17:44.959 --> 17:47.080
that it may not be priority homicide

17:47.200 --> 17:49.544
the police commission
has a problem with?

17:49.859 --> 17:51.020
Excuse me, commander?

17:51.140 --> 17:53.790
Chief Pope is in charge
of our race relations here,

17:53.910 --> 17:55.577
and it's blowing up in his face.

17:55.971 --> 17:58.752
So maybe instead of getting all
pissed off at me,

17:58.872 --> 18:01.347
maybe you should check out
how long an assistant chief

18:01.467 --> 18:03.505
usually lasts at the L.A.P.D.

18:04.612 --> 18:07.673
I thought you'd want to help me keep
our friend from an early retirement.

18:07.833 --> 18:09.452
By giving up my division?

18:09.572 --> 18:12.052
Why am I supposed to be
the fall guy here?

18:13.949 --> 18:16.514
You know what, commander? I don't want
to talk about this with you now.

18:16.634 --> 18:18.085
Pardon me. Excuse me.

18:27.895 --> 18:31.310
This man you're calling Mateo,
I know as Manuel Rivera.

18:31.554 --> 18:33.648
How well did you know Manuel Rivera?

18:33.768 --> 18:35.118
We worked together.

18:35.386 --> 18:36.577
I trusted him.

18:37.015 --> 18:40.270
Do you have any reason to believe
that the officers he shot were corrupt?

18:40.390 --> 18:43.486
The operating rule in Tijuana
right now is "trust no one."

18:43.926 --> 18:45.266
I know the feeling.

18:46.246 --> 18:47.709
And yet you stay.

18:49.556 --> 18:50.762
To succeed,

18:51.324 --> 18:54.031
corruption depends on decent
people either giving in

18:54.682 --> 18:55.929
or giving up.

18:56.543 --> 18:58.273
And I don't like giving up.

18:59.604 --> 19:01.519
Now, Manuel, he was my friend,

19:01.889 --> 19:03.880
but he abandoned his country,

19:04.314 --> 19:05.705
he has a new name.

19:06.413 --> 19:09.183
After changing so much,
who can say what he is like today?

19:10.058 --> 19:13.249
I'd like to think this is self-defense
on Manuel's part, but

19:13.721 --> 19:16.555
it would be great to hear
someone say that out loud.

19:16.944 --> 19:19.198
Is it possible to get
a report from your morgue?

19:19.318 --> 19:21.454
Okay, squat down a little.

19:23.297 --> 19:24.694
Down a little more.

19:26.612 --> 19:29.216
And, chief Johnson,
if you'll just stand there.

19:30.258 --> 19:31.006
Okay.

19:31.166 --> 19:34.398
Now, sergeant Gabriel,
if you'll just grab me from behind.

19:34.901 --> 19:35.718
Really?

19:36.185 --> 19:37.554
Around the neck.

19:38.211 --> 19:39.475
Not too tight.

19:40.008 --> 19:41.517
Okay, chief Johnson,

19:41.933 --> 19:43.133
walk towards me.

19:43.253 --> 19:44.962
And bang, bang, bang, bang!

19:45.205 --> 19:46.417
He shoots Gonzales.

19:46.537 --> 19:48.315
Bang! He blasts away Gomez's elbow.

19:48.475 --> 19:50.413
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang!

19:51.525 --> 19:53.702
Oh, my god. What is on that sponge?!

19:53.822 --> 19:54.965
Just water.

19:56.149 --> 19:58.481
You know what? I'm not sure.

19:59.587 --> 20:01.617
Here's, an antibacterial wipe.

20:02.057 --> 20:03.997
You, you'll be fine... Probably.

20:04.955 --> 20:06.570
You know what? Take two.

20:08.893 --> 20:11.963
So, our victims were killed
while attacking someone else?

20:12.083 --> 20:15.250
The angle of his entry wounds indicate
the gun was probably fired

20:15.370 --> 20:18.011
over the shoulder and
at extremely close range.

20:18.171 --> 20:20.998
The other guy,
just a few feet away from the weapon.

20:22.290 --> 20:24.017
Gonzales has four kids.

20:25.106 --> 20:26.918
What am I gonna tell his wife?

20:27.806 --> 20:29.586
I should call her, I suppose.

20:31.211 --> 20:32.679
Now, I understand

20:32.799 --> 20:36.202
that you still need to find Manuel
and get his side of the story,

20:36.322 --> 20:40.312
but the doctor's explanation seems
to fit the theory of self-defense, yes?

20:40.432 --> 20:42.440
But if Manuel was just
protecting himself, why

20:42.560 --> 20:45.329
didn't he call the police and report
what happened or alert the FBI?

20:45.449 --> 20:47.257
But he did alert the FBI.

20:47.566 --> 20:48.651
According to you,

20:48.771 --> 20:51.940
he told them last week what he thought
might happen, and they did nothing.

20:52.060 --> 20:53.497
And if you're from Tijuana

20:53.617 --> 20:56.525
and you know how much money
these cartels have to throw around,

20:56.645 --> 20:58.044
you think to yourself, "hey,

20:58.164 --> 21:00.751
maybe someone
from the FBI is giving me up."

21:01.314 --> 21:03.612
That's being a little paranoid,
don't you think?

21:04.084 --> 21:05.642
Manuel took on the cartels.

21:05.802 --> 21:08.016
Paranoia is how you stay alive.

21:08.594 --> 21:09.871
Myself, as well.

21:10.202 --> 21:12.524
I must keep my schedule secret.

21:12.793 --> 21:15.193
I sleep
in a different place every night.

21:15.313 --> 21:18.377
Someone's house or
an apartment or a church.

21:18.897 --> 21:20.657
I put bullet proof glass in my office.

21:20.817 --> 21:23.068
I'm sorry.
Did you say you sleep in churches?

21:23.188 --> 21:23.970
Well,

21:24.423 --> 21:26.913
even the cartels
are a little afraid of god.

21:27.813 --> 21:28.585
Chief.

21:29.367 --> 21:32.093
We are not going to that church.
Lieutenant provenza said not

21:32.213 --> 21:34.917
Father Donahue's minute
has turned into hours.

21:35.263 --> 21:37.210
Excuse me, comandante,

21:38.215 --> 21:40.282
are you up for a little confession?

21:48.093 --> 21:51.068
Are you sure you wouldn't like
to accompany me, comandante?

21:51.309 --> 21:53.997
If Manuel really
has sought sanctuary here,

21:54.938 --> 21:57.421
seeing a Tijuana police officer
may not be the best way

21:57.541 --> 21:59.106
to convince him to come out.

21:59.524 --> 22:01.518
All right, then.
Wish me luck.

22:01.812 --> 22:02.936
- Chief.
- Yes?

22:03.056 --> 22:05.490
I just want to say again,
for the record,

22:05.610 --> 22:07.829
that without the permission
of the archdiocese, this is...

22:07.989 --> 22:09.426
a very bad idea.

22:09.546 --> 22:12.270
Churches are like foreign embassies.
We don't just go storm into them...

22:12.390 --> 22:14.415
Thank you so much
for the warning, Sergeant.

22:14.535 --> 22:18.035
Now, if y'all excuse me,
I'll be back just as soon as I can.

22:39.468 --> 22:40.490
Oh, sorry.

22:41.035 --> 22:42.447
- Father Donahue?
- Yes?

22:42.607 --> 22:44.974
I'm deputy chief Brenda Leigh Johnson
of the L.A.P.D.

22:45.094 --> 22:47.966
The archdiocese said I could pop on by
and ask a few questions.

22:48.086 --> 22:49.796
- Do you mind?
- Oh, uh...

22:50.340 --> 22:51.102
well...

22:52.279 --> 22:53.874
- Okay.
- Thank you.

22:54.890 --> 22:57.137
Who did you speak to at the archdiocese?

22:57.257 --> 23:01.245
Um, I couldn't pronounce his last name,
so I just kept calling him "father."

23:01.365 --> 23:03.498
I'm sorry.
Were you eating dinner with someone?

23:03.618 --> 23:05.215
He was called away.

23:05.831 --> 23:08.369
I was told that you were
the only priest here.

23:08.489 --> 23:10.210
I am. Have a seat.

23:10.808 --> 23:12.766
Can I get you anything?

23:12.886 --> 23:16.126
Thank you. Um, a glass of water
would be nice.

23:16.476 --> 23:18.633
Do you watch a lot
of spanish television?

23:18.753 --> 23:19.453
Oh.

23:20.065 --> 23:22.612
My congregation's mostly latino, so...

23:23.139 --> 23:25.445
these programs
improve my language skills.

23:25.565 --> 23:27.673
- I see.
- What can I do for you?

23:28.435 --> 23:30.991
Well, first, I just want
to thank you so much

23:31.111 --> 23:32.914
for calling in the murders this morning.

23:33.074 --> 23:34.418
You're welcome.

23:35.535 --> 23:36.999
- Thank you.
- Sure.

23:37.119 --> 23:38.828
And I was
just wondering...

23:38.948 --> 23:42.540
the street where you found the bodies
is several blocks away from here.

23:42.660 --> 23:44.804
And unless you make a habit
of removing tarps

23:44.924 --> 23:48.042
from the backs of stolen pickups,
it seems to me you went out looking

23:48.162 --> 23:49.583
for the victims.

23:50.181 --> 23:53.064
Which is why you brought
the oil for last rites.

23:53.680 --> 23:56.356
You did perform last rites
on them, didn't you?

23:56.664 --> 23:59.147
- Why is that important to you?
- Because you interfered

23:59.267 --> 24:00.978
with my physical evidence,

24:01.395 --> 24:04.995
and it's my responsibility to find out
how these men lost their lives.

24:05.376 --> 24:06.896
And I take that very seriously.

24:07.016 --> 24:10.588
And it's my responsibility to make sure
they don't lose their souls, as well.

24:10.708 --> 24:12.537
And I take that very seriously.

24:20.233 --> 24:23.173
How did you know about
the bodies in the first place?

24:23.333 --> 24:25.886
I'm sorry. I can't share
that information with you.

24:26.006 --> 24:28.033
Because it came to you
under the seal of confession?

24:28.153 --> 24:29.922
- That's right.
- Was the person who shared

24:30.042 --> 24:31.572
this with you a man or a woman?

24:31.692 --> 24:32.579
Yes.

24:35.089 --> 24:36.843
This isn't a guessing game.

24:39.035 --> 24:41.109
All right, then, father.
Let's have

24:41.229 --> 24:42.831
a... theological discussion.

24:42.951 --> 24:45.399
Because you found out about
those bodies in confession,

24:45.519 --> 24:47.768
doesn't that mean a sin was involved?

24:49.380 --> 24:51.810
Are you familiar
with how confession works?

24:52.137 --> 24:53.387
I'd say so, yes.

24:54.149 --> 24:57.249
And I wouldn't think that killing
someone in self-defense is a sin.

24:58.401 --> 25:01.764
The commandment reads
"thou shalt not kill."

25:03.021 --> 25:04.966
It's pretty unambiguous.

25:05.086 --> 25:07.717
Now, whether those deaths
were murder or self-defense,

25:07.877 --> 25:09.768
I'm not qualified
to say.

25:10.747 --> 25:13.663
I help the penitent
find forgiveness from God,

25:14.411 --> 25:15.870
not from the state.

25:16.673 --> 25:19.020
Did you help a man named Manuel Rivera,

25:19.492 --> 25:21.315
also known as Mateo Hernandez?

25:21.435 --> 25:24.713
He attends church services here.
I know it because I found this

25:25.112 --> 25:26.217
on his desk.

25:26.616 --> 25:28.393
Now, you're known as a sanctuary church.

25:28.513 --> 25:30.626
Immigration has been here
several times, and they...

25:30.746 --> 25:32.818
and been turned away, yes.

25:34.287 --> 25:36.969
God doesn't recognize national borders.

25:37.089 --> 25:40.473
I, however, am very good
at recognizing my parishioners,

25:40.593 --> 25:41.960
and you're not one of them.

25:43.407 --> 25:45.422
I'll tell the archdiocese
that we spoke.

25:52.696 --> 25:55.268
- Look, father, I need your help.
- I'll be happy to pray for you.

25:55.388 --> 25:58.268
Manuel or Mateo or whatever name
you know him by,

25:58.388 --> 26:00.686
he came to see you...
I know it.

26:01.465 --> 26:04.103
The FBI knows it,
the Tijuana police know it,

26:04.223 --> 26:08.524
and that means, sooner or later,
the Ochoa drug cartel will know it.

26:10.639 --> 26:14.034
And this is what happened to the last
person who knew where Mateo was

26:14.194 --> 26:16.203
and tried to keep it a secret.

26:19.149 --> 26:20.490
Right. Okay.

26:23.572 --> 26:26.546
What would you do with Manuel
if you found him?

26:26.882 --> 26:29.723
I would hold him on homicide charges
until I checked out his story.

26:29.843 --> 26:32.759
I celebrate mass three days a week
at the county jail,

26:32.879 --> 26:34.855
and I take confession
from the Border Brothers

26:34.975 --> 26:38.038
and the Sinaloan Cowboys
and members of every latino street gang

26:38.158 --> 26:39.217
in Los Angeles...

26:39.337 --> 26:42.281
all of whom, in one way or another,
are connected to dope,

26:42.401 --> 26:44.801
which means the Ochoa cartel.

26:46.324 --> 26:49.021
They're waiting for you
to arrest somebody

26:49.141 --> 26:51.529
named Manuel Rivera or Mateo Hernandez.

26:52.322 --> 26:55.166
They've been told a former Tijuana
comandante of that name

26:55.286 --> 26:56.804
is gonna show up,

26:57.483 --> 26:58.962
and whoever kills him

26:59.214 --> 27:01.903
earns an instant $50,000 for his family.

27:03.063 --> 27:05.795
Ms. Johnson, Manuel has a price
on his head.

27:06.531 --> 27:09.124
He's not gonna last an hour
in the county jail.

27:10.008 --> 27:12.592
Well, I'm certain that we could find
a safe place to hold him.

27:14.047 --> 27:16.304
Fortunately, that's not your problem.

27:25.256 --> 27:29.133
Is it politically incorrect to suggest
that this is a mexican stand-off?

27:29.849 --> 27:30.762
Look...

27:31.404 --> 27:34.473
if you're really serious
about protecting Manuel,

27:35.288 --> 27:38.326
I always believe actions
are more powerful than words.

28:11.250 --> 28:14.629
So, the day that a negative front-page
article appears in the Times

28:14.749 --> 28:16.442
about priority homicide,

28:16.562 --> 28:20.120
- you seal off a catholic church.
- We're not on their property.

28:20.240 --> 28:21.946
Chief, we could have
undercovers out here

28:22.066 --> 28:23.663
stopping anybody from coming out.

28:23.823 --> 28:27.287
But they wouldn't have stopped people
from going in. Pardon me.

28:29.139 --> 28:30.775
Excuse me, chief Johnson,

28:31.088 --> 28:34.301
but personally, I don't believe Manuel
would ever come out of this church

28:34.421 --> 28:36.804
- with it surrounded like this.
- There's a bit of a negotiation

28:36.924 --> 28:40.863
going on, Comandante. I'll admit that.
But we'll get through it. Pardon me.

28:43.030 --> 28:46.288
Prints on this, I hope.
Let's see if they match Mateo's.

28:46.408 --> 28:48.976
Okay, and I think I know
why you were bumping on the blood

28:49.096 --> 28:51.574
in the back of the pickup...
because, first of all,

28:51.694 --> 28:53.401
it was several days old.

28:53.561 --> 28:56.069
But the San Diego police spoke
to the owner of that truck,

28:56.189 --> 28:58.144
and he said it just went missing
this morning.

28:58.264 --> 29:01.526
I'm thinking that's not entirely true,
because the blood... is AB negative.

29:01.646 --> 29:03.995
Very rare. It doesn't type out
with either of our victims.

29:04.155 --> 29:06.220
But I spoke to the mexican morgue,

29:06.340 --> 29:09.417
and Manuel Rivera's nephew...
AB negative.

29:10.567 --> 29:11.550
Thank you.

29:11.670 --> 29:14.148
Sergeant Gabriel, I want the license,
registration, and insurance

29:14.268 --> 29:17.209
on that stolen pickup
as soon as possible. Thank you.

29:23.153 --> 29:26.284
I really think what we have here
is a gigantic misunderstanding

29:26.404 --> 29:29.687
revolving around the word
"priority" and how it's applied.

29:29.847 --> 29:31.773
Come on in,
chief Johnson.

29:35.455 --> 29:36.663
Hello, Ricardo.

29:37.021 --> 29:39.178
Hope you're not angry with me, Chief.

29:39.457 --> 29:42.268
- I did call your team "elite."
- Ah, but, you see,

29:42.388 --> 29:45.182
- that's part of the misunderstanding.
- Right, exactly.

29:45.302 --> 29:48.645
Exactly what I was about to say.
You think that the word "priority"

29:48.765 --> 29:52.657
means we're assigning greater value
to victims who are white and/or rich,

29:52.777 --> 29:55.519
and we were never doing that,
were we, chief Johnson?

29:55.639 --> 29:56.381
No.

29:56.786 --> 29:59.496
And as a matter of fact, you've sort of
jumped the gun on us a little bit,

29:59.616 --> 30:03.331
because we're already under way with
a major departmental reorganization,

30:03.451 --> 30:06.934
and the first thing we are dropping
is priority homicide

30:07.054 --> 30:09.856
- because of the misinterpretation...
- okay, let me stop you right there.

30:09.976 --> 30:11.900
First of all,
I didn't misinterpret anything.

30:12.020 --> 30:13.786
The racial statistics
speak for themselves,

30:13.906 --> 30:16.484
- and chief Johnson... Still talking.
- I can address that.

30:17.169 --> 30:18.372
Still talking.

30:19.334 --> 30:22.314
And chief Johnson told me herself
that you deploy her division...

30:22.434 --> 30:24.427
which includes, what,
three lieutenants...

30:24.547 --> 30:28.340
in anticipation of newsworthy crimes?
Which means in addition to race,

30:28.460 --> 30:30.649
you're allowing the media
to determine your agenda.

30:30.769 --> 30:34.836
No. No, no, no. That was never the case.
And, chief Johnson was mistaken

30:34.996 --> 30:38.343
when she suggested that,
and I'm sure she'd like to tell you so.

30:39.169 --> 30:40.088
I would.

30:40.415 --> 30:43.803
I was, uh, irritated at the time,
and I spoke without thinking.

30:46.148 --> 30:48.938
Uh, we called the division
"priority homicide"

30:49.058 --> 30:53.082
because we were experimenting
with the concept of team investigation.

30:53.202 --> 30:57.306
And this experiment... which has been
completely successful, by the way...

30:57.776 --> 31:01.906
was the main focus in our homicide
cases. Hence, the word "priority."

31:02.581 --> 31:05.214
And we used our best people
because we felt,

31:05.334 --> 31:08.521
given that the concept
was fairly new, innovative...

31:08.641 --> 31:10.034
Right. Cutting-edge, really.

31:10.154 --> 31:14.042
It wasn't something we wanted to explore
with less-experienced detectives.

31:14.202 --> 31:16.381
And these were very tough cases,

31:16.501 --> 31:19.227
featuring suspects
with greater resources,

31:19.347 --> 31:22.878
who, as we find
in the greater population...

31:23.595 --> 31:25.861
often turn out to be white.

31:26.631 --> 31:29.926
Anyway, priority homicide
is now a thing of the past.

31:30.325 --> 31:32.693
As of tomorrow, actually,
deputy chief Johnson

31:32.813 --> 31:34.922
will be heading a new division
called "major crimes,"

31:35.042 --> 31:38.190
which will incorporate homicide units
from across the city.

31:40.441 --> 31:42.184
- Major crimes.
- Mm-hmm.

31:42.304 --> 31:44.989
The DA's office has a department
with the same designation.

31:45.852 --> 31:48.957
Well, if I can say
that you sped up this reorganization

31:49.077 --> 31:51.090
in response to part 1
of my article, this...

31:51.210 --> 31:53.624
definitely changes the nature
of what I'm writing in part 2.

31:53.744 --> 31:56.857
Oh, well, you, certainly
deserve to take credit for this,

31:56.977 --> 31:59.537
- don't you think, chief Pope?
- Absolutely.

32:00.153 --> 32:03.136
In fact, if you'd like
to come by tomorrow, we can...

32:03.256 --> 32:05.635
- show you what we're up to.
- And this isn't just some cosmetic

32:05.795 --> 32:07.472
shake-up? There's actually gonna be

32:07.592 --> 32:10.781
- some change involved?
- Oh, no, no. It's going to be huge.

32:11.180 --> 32:15.029
Major crimes puts my division
in charge not only of homicide,

32:15.149 --> 32:17.877
but also the larger fraud cases...

32:18.657 --> 32:21.181
and, uh,
kidnappings and rapes.

32:22.050 --> 32:24.370
- Rape and kidnapping.
- Well, yes. Those are

32:24.490 --> 32:26.256
major crimes, aren't they? I mean...

32:26.376 --> 32:29.113
does anyone think
that rape isn't a major crime?

32:30.821 --> 32:35.020
Oh, and... commander Taylor will be
reporting directly to me,

32:36.026 --> 32:39.120
coordinating my interaction
with the other divisions.

32:39.240 --> 32:42.965
Of course, my elite team of detectives
will stay entirely intact.

32:43.085 --> 32:45.633
- Oh, it's gonna be great!
- Oh, yeah.

32:45.793 --> 32:48.469
- This is exclusively mine?
- You're the first to hear it.

32:49.678 --> 32:52.530
Now, if you gentlemen will excuse me,

32:52.650 --> 32:54.183
I have a murder to wrap up.

32:54.764 --> 32:55.888
Pardon me.

32:58.842 --> 33:01.289
You see, and I... stupid me.

33:01.409 --> 33:04.570
I thought you guys were gonna
be, like, all mad and stuff.

33:04.690 --> 33:07.052
All right, well,
what time should I be here tomorrow?

33:07.759 --> 33:10.700
- Whatever time works for you.
- Yeah. Yeah, we're here.

33:19.435 --> 33:22.432
Actually, she's here.
I'm gonna call you back. Chief!

33:27.210 --> 33:28.803
You're ready for this?

33:29.691 --> 33:32.456
License and registration
on the pickup truck.

33:33.526 --> 33:34.390
Chief!

33:35.645 --> 33:38.092
The prints on the fork you gave me...
Mateo's,

33:38.212 --> 33:40.322
a.k.a. Manuel Rivera.

33:40.442 --> 33:42.177
Okay, so we know he's in the church.

33:42.297 --> 33:45.635
No one from central moves from there
until I give the word. Thank you.

33:45.755 --> 33:48.154
Lieutenant Tao,
there is one last set of prints

33:48.274 --> 33:50.908
I want you to pick up for me,
and if you could match them

33:51.028 --> 33:54.243
to one of the unidentified pair
we found on the not-so-stolen pickup,

33:54.363 --> 33:56.098
I would be eternally grateful.

33:56.218 --> 34:00.100
Okay. And from where would I be
lifting these prints from, exactly?

34:04.168 --> 34:07.616
Chief, I pulled up the DVD
agent Howard brought in.

34:07.736 --> 34:08.994
Plus, we have stills...

34:09.114 --> 34:12.384
Everything coming over the mexican
border synced up to license plates.

34:12.504 --> 34:14.112
So we went through them manually,

34:14.232 --> 34:16.159
and we started
an hour before the time stamp

34:16.279 --> 34:18.021
on our victims' passports.

34:18.141 --> 34:21.985
All right, let me go over this quickly
before interview the suspect.

34:22.813 --> 34:25.768
- Manuel's turning himself in?
- No, no, but I've proven

34:25.889 --> 34:27.161
that he's in the church,

34:27.282 --> 34:30.362
and I've surrounded it with police
officers, so I'm pretty sure he's safe.

34:30.523 --> 34:32.454
And here's our victims, Chief.

34:33.971 --> 34:36.092
But I thought this truck
was stolen last night.

34:36.212 --> 34:36.911
No.

34:37.288 --> 34:39.670
That's just what you told
the San Diego police this morning

34:39.791 --> 34:43.734
when you realized that your plan
to kill Manuel had gone terribly wrong.

34:46.259 --> 34:50.149
Let's keep this rolling for a moment.
I think we're in for another surprise.

34:50.502 --> 34:53.212
Comandante,
may I have your passport, please?

34:55.027 --> 34:57.045
Gentlemen, may I have your help?

34:58.456 --> 35:01.561
This is outrageous!
You have no right to treat me this way!

35:01.681 --> 35:03.616
- I am assisting you!
- And what better way

35:03.736 --> 35:06.092
to get away with murder
than to investigate it yourself?

35:06.212 --> 35:09.021
Murder? You cannot
charge me with murder.

35:09.141 --> 35:11.799
But we can for illegal
possession of a passport,

35:11.919 --> 35:13.902
because you're definitely not
two people,

35:14.022 --> 35:16.617
and yet you have two official IDs.

35:16.777 --> 35:19.078
And... there's a time stamp on this one.

35:19.238 --> 35:21.887
- Oh, my God.
- Well, what a coincidence.

35:22.250 --> 35:26.224
There you are crossing the border
right behind Gomez and Gonzales.

35:26.860 --> 35:29.185
And... what passport did you use?

35:29.305 --> 35:33.366
Did you use Martin Vasquez
or Raul Llamas?

35:33.486 --> 35:35.455
You know,
the name the truck's registered under?

35:35.575 --> 35:37.812
Obviously, you spend the money
the cartel pays you

35:37.932 --> 35:41.434
- living your other life in San Diego.
- No. No.

35:41.752 --> 35:44.755
- The truck is not mine.
- Sir, we just matched your prints

35:44.875 --> 35:47.314
off the pictures of the victims
that you handled in my office

35:47.434 --> 35:50.500
to a previously unidentified pair
that we found in the pickup.

35:50.620 --> 35:53.279
We also found a rare type
of blood in the pickup's cab,

35:53.399 --> 35:56.658
which matches that
of Manuel Rivera's nephew.

35:57.600 --> 35:58.307
Now,

35:58.977 --> 36:01.171
Now, we have some hard decisions
to make.

36:01.291 --> 36:02.839
And I need your help.

36:02.959 --> 36:06.576
Or things are gonna go very badly
for you, sir. Very badly.

36:07.182 --> 36:11.047
You have no idea
how things are in Tijuana right now.

36:12.101 --> 36:15.676
Is this how you explain things to people
who don't understand?

36:15.836 --> 36:19.358
How many people do you explain it to
the way you explained it to that boy?

36:19.478 --> 36:21.603
The boy was killed in Mexico.

36:21.723 --> 36:23.552
- It's not your concern.
- How do you know

36:23.672 --> 36:26.861
he was killed in mexico?!
Doesn't say so on the photograph!

36:29.493 --> 36:30.306
Look.

36:31.312 --> 36:33.073
Let's be reasonable here.

36:34.730 --> 36:37.681
You don't want to hold me
on this silly passport issue.

36:37.801 --> 36:39.408
I'd be out of your jail in hours.

36:40.116 --> 36:43.295
But Manuel Rivera wouldn't have been
out in hours, would he?

36:43.415 --> 36:46.164
You knew that if Manuel
successfully defended himself

36:46.284 --> 36:48.619
against Gomez and Gonzales
that I would be forced

36:48.739 --> 36:51.947
to leave him in the county jail
while I investigated his story,

36:52.067 --> 36:53.611
where you put a bounty on his head

36:53.731 --> 36:55.844
so one of his fellow prisoners
would kill him!

36:55.964 --> 36:58.341
Manuel put a bounty on his own head

36:58.461 --> 37:00.281
when he chose to fight the cartels.

37:00.401 --> 37:02.862
He will be a target
the rest of his life.

37:03.189 --> 37:04.566
Prove I did that...

37:05.001 --> 37:06.596
put a bounty on his head.

37:07.774 --> 37:08.807
Prove it.

37:09.913 --> 37:12.717
You can't even prove
that I sent Gomez and Gonzales

37:12.837 --> 37:15.334
- to kill him in the first place.
- If I could prove that,

37:15.454 --> 37:17.209
you'd be responsible for their deaths.

37:17.329 --> 37:19.668
And we could arrest you
on two counts of felony murder.

37:19.788 --> 37:20.516
Now,

37:20.952 --> 37:22.438
I'm gonna read you your rights

37:22.558 --> 37:25.402
and give you the opportunity
to confess your crimes.

37:25.522 --> 37:27.124
Don't waste your time.

37:27.486 --> 37:29.041
I have nothing to say.

37:31.492 --> 37:32.960
We'll see about that.

37:35.606 --> 37:36.476
Oh, no.

37:37.074 --> 37:38.343
Two passports.

37:38.977 --> 37:42.494
I don't know which name to arrest
you under. That complicates things.

37:42.614 --> 37:44.605
It doesn't matter which name.

37:46.373 --> 37:47.727
All right, then.

37:49.232 --> 37:51.440
I'll send you
to the county jail this way...

37:51.560 --> 37:54.050
Mateo Hernandez, a.k.a. Manuel Rivera,

37:54.170 --> 37:57.848
you are under arrest for the murder
of Jacinto Gonzales and Carlos Gomez!

37:57.968 --> 37:59.414
- What?!
<i>- You have the right</i>

37:59.534 --> 38:01.226
you know that's not my name!

38:01.346 --> 38:03.604
What difference does it make?
You said it didn't matter.

38:03.724 --> 38:06.162
<i>If you can't afford one will be
appointed for you by the state.</i>

38:06.322 --> 38:08.086
<i>Have you heard and understood
these rights?</i>

38:08.206 --> 38:11.483
- You cannot arrest me as Manuel!
- I can, and I have.

38:11.812 --> 38:14.249
This is murder!

38:14.369 --> 38:16.798
If it is, then you
planned it yourself.

38:16.918 --> 38:18.484
And you can stop it.

38:18.829 --> 38:22.645
Did you send Gomez and Gonzales
across the border to kill Manuel Rivera?

38:22.765 --> 38:26.134
Did you offer $50,000 to
the person who could kill him?!

38:26.254 --> 38:27.000
No!!

38:27.551 --> 38:32.541
You... you must arrest me
as Martin Vasquez!

38:32.661 --> 38:35.018
I'm so sorry, sir.
I'm changing your name

38:35.348 --> 38:37.020
to protect the innocent.

38:41.625 --> 38:42.698
Let her go!

38:43.172 --> 38:45.524
Let her go, you son of a bitch!

38:50.373 --> 38:51.666
I will kill you!

38:52.292 --> 38:54.520
You will die for this... all of you!

38:54.640 --> 38:56.568
You will all die for this...

38:56.688 --> 38:57.819
all of you!

38:58.690 --> 38:59.832
All of you!

39:01.889 --> 39:03.648
You will all die for this!

39:06.048 --> 39:08.140
Die for what, comandante? Hmm?

39:09.241 --> 39:12.339
What's there to be afraid of,
comandante? Huh?

39:12.659 --> 39:15.124
If you're really innocent,
you'll be out of jail in no time.

39:15.244 --> 39:17.336
Wait! Wait! I have...

39:17.456 --> 39:18.750
I have access to...

39:19.148 --> 39:21.404
I can make you all rich... all of you!

39:21.564 --> 39:23.756
- Hey, Vasquez!
- Wait!

39:24.441 --> 39:27.640
If you see Gonzales and Gomez,
tell them we all said hi.

39:50.563 --> 39:53.563
Hey. This place is kind of beautiful.

39:54.482 --> 39:55.597
Don't start.

40:19.438 --> 40:21.564
Bless me, father, for I have sinned.

40:24.501 --> 40:26.761
How long has it been
since your last confession?

40:27.427 --> 40:30.910
Well, I almost got one last night,
but the suspect, Manuel Rivera,

40:31.030 --> 40:34.919
a.k.a. Mateo Hernandez,
was killed in the county jail.

40:37.933 --> 40:40.755
- You say Manuel is dead.
- Officially...

40:42.314 --> 40:43.075
yes.

40:43.818 --> 40:45.957
And it's been reported
in the press.

40:46.483 --> 40:49.519
That's why I removed the police
from around your church.

40:50.154 --> 40:51.567
You're safe now.

40:52.437 --> 40:53.942
And so is your friend.

40:54.467 --> 40:58.173
And what will become of the man
I know as Manuel Rivera?

40:58.970 --> 41:00.673
Well, I have an FBI agent here,

41:00.793 --> 41:03.670
if Manuel wants to be supplied
with a new identity.

41:04.034 --> 41:05.955
But you're an expert in immigration.

41:06.075 --> 41:08.435
And if there's one thing our government
has successfully proven

41:08.555 --> 41:10.175
that it can't do at all,

41:10.573 --> 41:12.404
it's find illegal aliens.

41:18.476 --> 41:20.189
I'll keep you in my prayers.

41:21.304 --> 41:24.110
I'll take that in the spirit
it was given, father.

41:55.221 --> 41:56.142
Manuel?

41:58.995 --> 42:00.792
Good luck to you, sir.

42:02.409 --> 42:04.003
Bless you, Señora.

42:04.964 --> 42:06.233
I will need it.
