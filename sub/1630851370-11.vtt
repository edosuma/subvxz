WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:02.970
<i>Ah,</i> Fame.

00:03.104 --> 00:05.239
<i>Back in the '80s,
this tale of artsy kids</i>

00:05.373 --> 00:07.608
<i>singing and dancing
their way through
high school delighted me,</i>

00:07.741 --> 00:09.343
<i>but not everyone got it.</i>

00:09.477 --> 00:10.644
They're all moving
too much.

00:10.778 --> 00:12.613
Aren't you swept up
in their passion

00:12.746 --> 00:14.215
and devotion
to the craft?

00:14.348 --> 00:16.016
I'll give you a craft.
Plumbing.

00:16.150 --> 00:18.052
That's where they're all
gonna be in ten years,

00:18.186 --> 00:20.654
when their knees give out and
the songs don't pay the bills.

00:20.788 --> 00:22.390
How does every conversation

00:22.523 --> 00:24.225
end in your
pro-plumbing stance?

00:24.358 --> 00:26.827
<i>Turns out,
I wasn't the only one
obsessed with it.</i>

00:26.960 --> 00:30.298
I have everything in common
with these artistic children.

00:30.431 --> 00:33.434
Oh, yeah? That last one
just did a backflip
off a fire hydrant.

00:33.567 --> 00:35.569
That's for official use,
moron!

00:35.703 --> 00:38.038
Us artsy types are
an unpredictable bunch.

00:38.172 --> 00:39.573
I'll give you
a prediction...

00:39.707 --> 00:41.375
Plumber, plumber,
plumber, plumber.

00:41.509 --> 00:43.711
Shush!
We share an artist's soul.

00:43.844 --> 00:47.548
<i>Yep,
my mom had a bad case
of</i> Fame <i>fever.</i>

00:47.681 --> 00:48.982
Look at me.

00:51.385 --> 00:52.786
Fun stuff, Mrs. G.

00:52.920 --> 00:54.722
But why exactly are you
drumming on my glass of Tang?

00:54.855 --> 00:57.225
She's trying to re-create
the magical, rhythmic energy

00:57.358 --> 00:59.327
of the <i>Hot Lunch Jam</i> number
from <i>Fame.</i>

00:59.460 --> 01:00.994
Stop <i>Fame</i> -ing us
during dinner.

01:01.129 --> 01:03.097
Those were high school kids.
You're like 100!

01:03.231 --> 01:04.465
It's embarrassing.

01:04.598 --> 01:06.200
Don't resist.
We all know this rat-a-tatting

01:06.334 --> 01:08.736
is gonna end in
some family hip-shaking
and booty-quaking.

01:08.869 --> 01:11.505
This reads as
super crazy to me,
but do your thing.

01:11.639 --> 01:13.141
Unh!
There you go, Geoffrey.

01:13.274 --> 01:14.775
Feel the throbbing pulsations

01:14.908 --> 01:16.544
with your future
mother-in-law.

01:16.677 --> 01:17.678
Geoff, don't you dare
let the beat in.

01:17.811 --> 01:19.046
It's too late.
Beat's knocking.

01:19.180 --> 01:21.048
Sorry, babe.
Geoffy's gotta open the door!

01:21.182 --> 01:23.016
Whoo!
Gah! I truly hate this,

01:23.151 --> 01:24.918
but the sound is incomplete
without my beatboxing.

01:25.052 --> 01:26.554
Joanne?

01:26.687 --> 01:29.123
Any interest in making sweet,
sweet music with us?

01:29.257 --> 01:30.658
Uh, the wording
is questionable,

01:30.791 --> 01:32.926
but I make a habit of
never saying no to anything.

01:33.060 --> 01:35.429
Uh-oh!
Look what I found

01:35.563 --> 01:37.831
carelessly placed
in front of Erica!

01:37.965 --> 01:39.233
No, it's not
going to happen.

01:39.367 --> 01:41.302
I feel nothing.
It doesn't work on me.

01:41.435 --> 01:42.870
Come on.
Fine.

01:43.003 --> 01:44.071
Ooh!
Whoo!

01:45.606 --> 01:47.841
Unh-unh!
Bring it on down.

01:47.975 --> 01:49.443
Whoo, yeah!

01:49.577 --> 01:51.445
Come on, Adam.
Get on Mama's shoulders.

01:51.579 --> 01:53.113
It's time to take this
to the street.

01:53.247 --> 01:55.549
The power of the rhythm
makes me believe
that's a good idea.

01:55.683 --> 01:57.285
Hot Lunch! Whoo!
Okay. Whoa!

01:57.418 --> 01:58.886
<i>♪ I'm twisted up inside</i>

01:59.019 --> 02:02.190
<i>♪ But nonetheless,
I feel the need to say</i>

02:05.092 --> 02:06.660
<i>♪ I don't know the future</i>

02:06.794 --> 02:08.962
<i>♪ But the past keeps getting
clearer every day ♪</i>

02:09.096 --> 02:11.932
<i>It was
January 12th,
1980-something.</i>

02:12.065 --> 02:14.568
<i>For Erica and Geoff,
a typical morning at college,</i>

02:14.702 --> 02:17.471
<i>until my sister spotted
her pal Jean Jacobs.</i>

02:17.605 --> 02:19.139
Jean? Hey.

02:19.273 --> 02:20.941
Why are you wearing a party
dress at 7:00 in the morning?

02:21.074 --> 02:23.277
Ooh, are you going to
a Daytime Emmy watch party?

02:23.411 --> 02:25.413
Outstanding Game Show Host
is a nail-biter this year.

02:25.546 --> 02:26.880
I'm just heading home
from an all-nighter.

02:27.014 --> 02:29.917
It was awesome. We pre-gamed
at the Villanova tailgate,

02:30.050 --> 02:31.685
and then we post-gamed at
this abandoned cookie factory,

02:31.819 --> 02:34.288
but that sucked,
so I called my friend Alice.

02:34.422 --> 02:36.156
She was at Sammy's
with this guy
she's hooking up with.

02:36.290 --> 02:37.591
Y'all know Tater?

02:37.725 --> 02:39.860
I know tater tots,
the fry's rambunctious cousin.

02:39.993 --> 02:40.994
Don't care
for their shape.

02:41.128 --> 02:43.096
Well, our night
was bananas, too.

02:43.231 --> 02:45.165
We watched a bartender
do crazy bottle tricks,

02:45.299 --> 02:46.667
and then he got into
a fight with his boss,

02:46.800 --> 02:48.168
who's also a bottle juggler,

02:48.302 --> 02:49.637
and then he moved to Jamaica.

02:49.770 --> 02:51.104
Isn't that the plot
to the movie <i>Cocktail</i>

02:51.239 --> 02:52.573
starring Tom Cruise?

02:52.706 --> 02:54.508
Yeah, we rented it
and ordered in Chinese.

02:54.642 --> 02:55.809
The egg rolls were heavy,
so I fell asleep

02:55.943 --> 02:57.010
and don't really know
how it ends.

02:57.144 --> 02:58.679
Oh, he gets the girl.
Oh, nice.

02:58.812 --> 03:01.181
Aw. I forgot you guys
are all locked down,

03:01.315 --> 03:02.683
just engaged and crap.

03:02.816 --> 03:04.518
Well, one woman's crap
is another man's

03:04.652 --> 03:06.454
mountaintop of utter bliss.

03:06.587 --> 03:08.121
Don't oversell it, Geoff.

03:08.256 --> 03:09.623
So we'll catch you
in poli sci later?

03:09.757 --> 03:11.625
I can't. I gotta crash.

03:11.759 --> 03:13.126
And then I gotta figure out
what I'm wearing

03:13.261 --> 03:14.962
to the Theta Beta
Just Your Bra Party.

03:15.095 --> 03:16.564
Seems like it's
right there in the name.

03:16.697 --> 03:18.499
College is the best!

03:18.632 --> 03:20.334
Bye!

03:20.468 --> 03:22.670
<i>With that,
Erica and Geoff
couldn't help but wonder</i>

03:22.803 --> 03:25.606
<i>why their college experience
felt a little different.</i>

03:25.739 --> 03:28.376
So, Jean Jacobs is
really getting after it.

03:28.509 --> 03:29.710
Are we getting after it?

03:29.843 --> 03:31.845
Of course. We just got
the monthly rental record

03:31.979 --> 03:33.180
at West Coast Video.

03:33.314 --> 03:34.582
We beat out everyone,
including that boy

03:34.715 --> 03:36.049
with no immune system
who can't go outside.

03:36.183 --> 03:37.751
You're right.
We're crushing college.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.553
Wrong!
Buzzer sound!

03:39.687 --> 03:41.355
Gah! How'd you
get in here?

03:41.489 --> 03:43.223
Also, I didn't even bake
that lasagna yet.

03:43.357 --> 03:44.725
This is what you get
for giving me a key

03:44.858 --> 03:46.026
in case of emergency.

03:46.159 --> 03:47.561
And the emergency was,

03:47.695 --> 03:49.229
we wanted to see
what was in your fridge.

03:49.363 --> 03:50.564
I combined all your juices

03:50.698 --> 03:52.600
into one giant tropical
super-juice.

03:52.733 --> 03:53.801
It was horrible.
I dumped it out.

03:53.934 --> 03:55.336
Geoff and I do stuff.

03:55.469 --> 03:56.604
We went to Bookbinder's
on Friday.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.539
I heard.
Nana and Poppy said

03:58.672 --> 04:00.073
they ran into you
on your way out,

04:00.207 --> 04:01.809
and they eat dinner
at, like, 4:00.

04:01.942 --> 04:02.976
Well, we were beating
the rush.

04:03.110 --> 04:05.078
Which we did, by the way.
Rush beaten.

04:05.212 --> 04:06.714
You know what?
Being engaged in college

04:06.847 --> 04:09.016
has turned you both
into pathetic,
do-nothing sad sacks.

04:09.149 --> 04:11.184
Oh, come on.
There's a whole community

04:11.319 --> 04:13.521
of like-minded young,
engaged people on campus.

04:13.654 --> 04:14.555
I mean,
there has to be.

04:14.688 --> 04:16.256
For sure.
College is all about

04:16.390 --> 04:17.891
permanent and endless monogamy.

04:18.025 --> 04:20.761
You can totally be engaged
in college and still be cool,

04:20.894 --> 04:22.463
and we'll prove it
with a dinner party.

04:22.596 --> 04:25.499
It's either dinner
or a party, Erica.

04:25.633 --> 04:27.100
You can't have it
both ways.

04:27.234 --> 04:28.369
Who's coming to
this shindig?

04:28.502 --> 04:31.639
You guys, and every fun-loving
engaged couple around.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.507
We'll lock in a few
of those firecrackers,

04:33.641 --> 04:35.208
and then you'll see
how we go off.

04:35.343 --> 04:36.910
To quote the teen
who lives downstairs

04:37.044 --> 04:38.579
that I'm desperate
to impress, "Booyah."

04:38.712 --> 04:39.947
Booyah indeed.

04:40.080 --> 04:41.582
<i>As Erica
and Geoff insisted</i>

04:41.715 --> 04:43.050
<i>they weren't boring weirdos,</i>

04:43.183 --> 04:46.053
<i>Principal Ball was busy
boring the faculty.</i>

04:46.186 --> 04:48.922
Next week is our annual
Teacher-Senior-Sendoff,

04:49.056 --> 04:52.225
so why don't we just
rip off the Band-Aid

04:52.360 --> 04:53.827
and do a quick rehearsal.

04:56.697 --> 05:00.067
<i>♪ Voices ring out to thee</i>

05:00.200 --> 05:02.069
<i>♪ Hail, William Penn ♪</i>

05:02.202 --> 05:03.904
Stop it!

05:04.037 --> 05:07.475
These wonderful children
have been in our care
for 12 formative years!

05:07.608 --> 05:09.309
Don't you think they
deserve a better send-off

05:09.443 --> 05:11.579
than some mournful dirge?

05:11.712 --> 05:14.448
Oh, botheration.
She's got something cooking.

05:14.582 --> 05:15.916
You can tell by her tone.

05:16.049 --> 05:18.486
Now, who knows
the musical sensation <i>Fame?</i>

05:18.619 --> 05:20.554
Don't you mean "Lame"? Ha!

05:20.688 --> 05:24.257
Move over, Leonard Maltin.
I'm starting my own takedown
of Hollywood's biggest misses.

05:24.392 --> 05:25.759
You could call it
<i>Woodburn's Burns.</i>

05:25.893 --> 05:27.428
I've never liked you
till this moment.

05:27.561 --> 05:29.530
Mm.
Okay. Focus!

05:29.663 --> 05:32.700
I'm talking about a big,
theatrical production

05:32.833 --> 05:35.569
with singing, choreography,
costumes,

05:35.703 --> 05:37.705
and me at the center
of it all.

05:37.838 --> 05:40.508
Or we could go
with the dumb hymn.

05:40.641 --> 05:42.610
It's horrible,
but it's easier to sing

05:42.743 --> 05:44.311
while plastered
on cooking sherry.

05:44.445 --> 05:46.179
Maybe this should be
a take-aside,

05:46.313 --> 05:48.382
but I like what you're
putting out there.

05:48.516 --> 05:50.350
These are our seniors
we're talking about.

05:50.484 --> 05:51.919
Let's blow it out.

05:52.052 --> 05:54.121
As principal,
I have the final word,

05:54.254 --> 05:56.123
and our crappy hymn it is.

05:56.256 --> 05:58.492
Thank you, Earl,
for shutting down
Beverly Goldberg,

05:58.626 --> 06:01.128
who pitched an idea
that we all hate.

06:01.261 --> 06:04.064
I love your <i>Fame</i> idea.
Really?

06:04.197 --> 06:07.334
Yes. I'm a <i>Fame</i> -a-holic.
I've seen it 19 times.

06:07.468 --> 06:09.703
The ticket guy at the theater
thinks I'm mentally unstable.

06:09.837 --> 06:11.905
Well, you know,
they have it on VHS, John.

06:12.039 --> 06:14.775
I was an early adopter
of the Sony format Betamax.

06:14.908 --> 06:17.044
Its retail failure
was also my own.

06:17.177 --> 06:20.213
Then why'd you double down
and say my idea was terrible?

06:20.347 --> 06:23.216
Peer pressure
and outie belly buttons
are my greatest fears.

06:23.350 --> 06:26.353
But you don't know
how many school musicals
I've sat through,

06:26.487 --> 06:29.790
silently longing to be
up there under those
hot lights myself.

06:29.923 --> 06:32.593
Then, baby,
they'll remember your name.

06:32.726 --> 06:33.827
That's from the movie!

06:35.463 --> 06:37.397
<i>While my mom
and Glascott cooked up a plan,</i>

06:37.531 --> 06:40.000
<i>dinner was served
at Erica and Geoff's.</i>

06:40.133 --> 06:41.201
Who wants crostinis?

06:41.334 --> 06:42.770
Ooh.
Ooh.

06:42.903 --> 06:45.573
Trip? Dawn?
Some crusty bread
for dipping?

06:45.706 --> 06:47.240
Well, did you know
bread from the fridge

06:47.374 --> 06:49.710
goes stale
six times faster than bread
at room temperature?

06:49.843 --> 06:51.178
Sweet bread fact, bro.

06:51.311 --> 06:53.246
I'll remember it next time
I can't fall asleep.

06:53.380 --> 06:54.882
<i>After a painful search,</i>

06:55.015 --> 06:56.984
<i>Erica and Geoff
managed to find</i>

06:57.117 --> 06:58.752
<i>one other engaged couple
on campus,</i>

06:58.886 --> 07:00.353
<i>who were boring as hell.</i>

07:00.488 --> 07:03.090
Who knew there were so many
kinds of crisper drawers?

07:04.257 --> 07:05.392
That's crazy.

07:05.526 --> 07:08.929
It covers theft, water damage,
natural disasters,

07:09.062 --> 07:10.430
bodily injuries...

07:10.564 --> 07:12.265
<i>Everything crisps.</i>

07:12.399 --> 07:17.705
Lettuce, zucchini,
squash, potatoes...

07:17.838 --> 07:20.541
Turns out, our shower head
wasn't properly sealed.

07:20.674 --> 07:22.643
It was like, drip,

07:22.776 --> 07:29.382
drip, drip, drip,
drip, drip.

07:29.517 --> 07:30.651
Interesting.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.452
Babe?

07:32.586 --> 07:34.454
Erica?
Oh. That's crazy.

07:34.588 --> 07:35.856
We gotta do something.
Yeah.

07:35.989 --> 07:39.159
Sister Erica,
join me on the veranda
to look at the moon?

07:39.292 --> 07:40.861
Brother Geoff,
can you show me

07:40.994 --> 07:42.329
where you keep
your sharpest knives?

07:43.430 --> 07:45.799
Dude, do you not see
what's going on?

07:45.933 --> 07:47.000
You're failing
your partner.

07:47.134 --> 07:48.335
Wait, is Erica upset?

07:48.468 --> 07:50.504
Yes, she's realizing
her future is just gonna be

07:50.638 --> 07:52.540
these stuffy-ass dinners
with Drip and Yawn.

07:52.673 --> 07:55.042
Trip and Dawn.
And, oh, my God,
she is realizing that.

07:55.175 --> 07:57.310
Yuh-huh.
She used to be a party girl,

07:57.444 --> 07:59.479
but you shut the door
on that part of her life
when you got engaged.

07:59.613 --> 08:00.848
You made her a snooze.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.551
Snooze? Dad says that's
the button for quitters.

08:03.684 --> 08:06.119
I can't believe Geoff
roped us into dinner
with these dipwads.

08:06.253 --> 08:07.788
No, don't blame sweet,
simple Geoffrey.

08:07.921 --> 08:09.723
If this is anyone's fault,
it's yours.

08:09.857 --> 08:10.991
How?
Think about it.

08:11.124 --> 08:13.026
Geoff's always been Geoff.

08:13.160 --> 08:16.730
Anxious, uptight,
indecisive, hugely boring.

08:16.864 --> 08:17.931
But in a lovable way.

08:18.065 --> 08:19.266
He's the best.

08:19.399 --> 08:21.969
But you?
You used to be a badass.

08:22.102 --> 08:24.337
A dropout rock star
who scared people.

08:25.205 --> 08:26.306
Well, then what am I now?

08:26.439 --> 08:28.542
Putting it gently?
Walking, talking death.

08:28.676 --> 08:29.943
Hey!
Hey yourself.

08:30.077 --> 08:32.145
You make Trip and Dawn
seem like Robin Williams.

08:32.279 --> 08:33.581
This is all very unfair.

08:33.714 --> 08:34.682
So what do I do?

08:34.815 --> 08:36.316
You're gonna throw a rager.

08:36.449 --> 08:38.952
The biggest party ever.

08:39.086 --> 08:42.856
Also, side note,
Dawn wants me bad.

08:42.990 --> 08:44.524
I'm gonna go
eat all the cheese.

08:44.658 --> 08:46.894
<i>As Erica and Geoff
realized they needed a change,</i>

08:47.027 --> 08:49.496
<i>my mom was gonna change
the teachers' minds.</i>

08:51.464 --> 08:55.202
<i>'Cause nothing gets
people excited for</i> Fame
<i>like a</i> Hot Lunch Jam.

08:58.672 --> 09:00.473
<i>Or, at least,
that's what my mom thought.</i>

09:00.608 --> 09:02.142
No one else is
<i>Hot Lunch Jam-</i> ing.

09:02.275 --> 09:04.712
Trust me, if it worked on
my cynical kids,

09:04.845 --> 09:06.379
it'll work
on this crusty bunch.

09:06.513 --> 09:07.681
<i>And yet,
it couldn't,</i>

09:07.815 --> 09:09.650
<i>despite their best attempts.</i>

09:11.184 --> 09:13.153
<i>They even did this.</i>

09:13.286 --> 09:15.388
Has it ever taken this long?
No.

09:15.522 --> 09:18.325
We should be
a tangle of sweaty
teacher bodies by now.

09:18.458 --> 09:19.993
I know.
Get on the table.

09:20.127 --> 09:21.528
I'll dramatically
uncover the piano.
Okay.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.568
What is going on in here?

09:28.702 --> 09:30.570
They're making me
do the impossible,

09:30.704 --> 09:32.539
not enjoy my cod.

09:32.673 --> 09:35.408
Beverly, I told you
we're doing the Quaker hymn.

09:35.542 --> 09:37.044
Just give it a chance.

09:37.177 --> 09:39.713
Damn it, John.
Tell a story with your hips!

09:40.814 --> 09:43.583
I'm going down!
Aah!

09:43.717 --> 09:44.852
Ow, my leg!

09:44.985 --> 09:45.819
Oh, dang it.

09:45.953 --> 09:47.354
Feel better, Earl.

09:47.487 --> 09:50.157
Sorry about
your dislocated leg.

09:50.290 --> 09:53.426
Well, he's gone.
Who's in charge now?

09:53.560 --> 09:55.128
That'd be
Vice Principal Davis.

09:55.262 --> 09:57.097
But he took a leave of absence
to deal with family issues.

09:57.230 --> 09:58.598
So who's after him?

09:58.732 --> 10:00.868
I say we Thunderdome for it.

10:01.001 --> 10:02.069
We're not all
gonna fight you.

10:02.202 --> 10:04.772
Not at once.
I'm thinking round-robin.

10:04.905 --> 10:07.407
Well, thankfully, I have
the William Penn charter

10:07.540 --> 10:11.244
shrunken down to pocket size
for situations just like this.

10:11.378 --> 10:12.813
Oh, my.
What's "Oh, my"?

10:12.946 --> 10:16.049
Because I'm coming around
to this Thunderdome idea.

10:16.183 --> 10:17.818
The line of succession
is very clear.

10:17.951 --> 10:20.153
Principal,
vice principal,

10:20.287 --> 10:21.254
Quaker warden.

10:21.388 --> 10:23.623
Is that me?
No, 'tis I.

10:23.757 --> 10:25.058
And you know
what that means?

10:25.192 --> 10:27.828
We're doing <i>Fame!</i>

10:27.961 --> 10:29.797
No, I'm in charge.
I get to say it.
Oh.

10:29.930 --> 10:33.500
We're doing <i>Fame!</i>

10:36.103 --> 10:37.437
<i>Desperate to prove to each other</i>

10:37.570 --> 10:39.106
<i>that they still knew
how to party,</i>

10:39.239 --> 10:41.174
<i>Erica and Geoff
got to planning.</i>

10:41.308 --> 10:44.577
Okay, so, what kind of
sick bash should this be

10:44.712 --> 10:46.413
that we both definitely
really want?

10:46.546 --> 10:48.048
So bad. And big.

10:48.181 --> 10:50.283
A big, bad one.
Like, with games.

10:50.417 --> 10:52.720
Games, for sure.
Games would be...

10:53.586 --> 10:54.788
One idea.

10:54.922 --> 10:56.156
Not one that I would do.

10:56.289 --> 10:58.358
Maybe something more college.
Right, Geoff?

10:58.491 --> 10:59.326
Right. Something more college.

11:00.360 --> 11:01.494
Water.

11:01.628 --> 11:02.796
Milkshakes.

11:02.930 --> 11:04.097
Beer. That's beer.

11:04.231 --> 11:05.833
Yeah, like a few six-packs.

11:05.966 --> 11:07.367
Ten-packs?

11:07.500 --> 11:08.635
Ten six-packs.

11:08.769 --> 11:09.636
That sounds perfect.

11:09.770 --> 11:12.672
And a big guy.

11:12.806 --> 11:14.875
Santa! Fun is always
in season.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.676
That's a keg.
That's what I meant.

11:16.810 --> 11:18.178
Oh, yeah.
I was gonna say keg.

11:18.311 --> 11:19.679
Like, one big old keg.

11:19.813 --> 11:21.014
You'll need six kegs.

11:21.148 --> 11:22.315
Sorry, I didn't know
how to indicate that.

11:22.449 --> 11:26.319
If I know us and our many
beer-guzzling pals,

11:26.453 --> 11:27.855
that's the right amount.

11:27.988 --> 11:30.523
Speaking of,
who should we invite?
Bret Michaels.

11:30.657 --> 11:32.459
How about a nice mix of
students and faculty?

11:32.592 --> 11:34.294
Or maybe a random mix
of everyone.

11:34.427 --> 11:36.029
Get a band, too.
A loud one.

11:36.163 --> 11:37.497
Ooh, like a jazz trio.

11:37.630 --> 11:39.299
You know what kind of music
Erica loves?

11:39.432 --> 11:42.102
Heavy metal.
Oh, yeah. Big head-banger.

11:42.235 --> 11:43.904
Studies have shown
that heavy metal

11:44.037 --> 11:45.472
can be damaging
to your hearing.

11:45.605 --> 11:48.441
Geoff.
Which is why we have
four other senses.

11:48.575 --> 11:49.843
You do rely on
your nose a lot.

11:49.977 --> 11:52.746
I do. I do. My old sniffer
really fills out the world.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.514
Still feels like you've got to
kick it up a notch.

11:54.647 --> 11:55.783
Like human bowling.

11:55.916 --> 11:57.284
And ax-chucking.

11:57.417 --> 11:58.852
A foam room.
Snake racing.

11:58.986 --> 12:01.421
Fire-breathing.
Boxing, both regular and foxy.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.223
A foam room.
You said that already.

12:03.356 --> 12:04.892
I'm repeating it
for emphasis.
Oh, okay.

12:05.025 --> 12:07.394
Those all seem perfect
for the party I want.

12:07.527 --> 12:10.130
Me, too.
I guess I'll go tidy up
and buy some axes.

12:11.364 --> 12:13.934
Is it possible that
we got carried away?

12:14.067 --> 12:15.502
Yeah.
Nailed it again.

12:15.635 --> 12:17.270
<i>As Erica and Geoff
wanted to prove</i>

12:17.404 --> 12:18.906
<i>they were
the greatest partiers alive,</i>

12:19.039 --> 12:22.542
<i>the faculty wouldn't be
caught dead performing</i> Fame.

12:22.675 --> 12:25.678
You can't seriously
expect us to get up
on that stage, Beverly.

12:25.813 --> 12:28.381
It's Acting Principal Beverly.

12:28.515 --> 12:32.285
As such, I could easily
have your history class
moved to room B100.

12:32.419 --> 12:33.486
The windowless basement?

12:33.620 --> 12:34.955
I mean, who would even direct?

12:35.088 --> 12:37.791
I've got someone with
an intimate knowledge of <i>Fame.</i>

12:37.925 --> 12:41.361
A bouncy little number
composed straight
out of my body.

12:41.494 --> 12:43.530
Your maestro has arrived!

12:43.663 --> 12:46.133
The only thing I haven't done
in my storied career

12:46.266 --> 12:47.935
at this school
is direct a play.

12:48.068 --> 12:49.069
Or do a single pull-up.

12:49.202 --> 12:51.504
Coach Mellor, chorus.
Hmm!

12:51.638 --> 12:53.740
In just three days,
you'll be asking me,

12:53.874 --> 12:55.408
"Why are they all staring?"

12:55.542 --> 12:58.378
The answer is simple,
<i>Fame.</i>

12:58.511 --> 12:59.746
And that weird little cane
you got, Goldberg.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.382
Mr. Perott, also chorus.
Boom!

13:02.515 --> 13:03.951
Anyone else
want to test me?

13:04.084 --> 13:05.618
I think you're doing
a great job, Adam.

13:05.752 --> 13:07.354
Glascott, male lead.

13:07.487 --> 13:09.289
Yes! I earned it
with my talent.

13:09.422 --> 13:11.724
Now get some sleep,
you merry band of players,

13:11.859 --> 13:14.561
for tomorrow,
you tread my stage.

13:14.694 --> 13:15.963
But we're all
here now.

13:16.096 --> 13:17.730
Tomorrow!

13:17.865 --> 13:19.166
That's right, poopie.
Keep 'em guessing.

13:19.299 --> 13:20.800
That's great leadership.

13:20.934 --> 13:21.701
<i>And so...</i>

13:21.835 --> 13:23.036
Ow.

13:23.170 --> 13:24.571
<i>...I embraced
the role of director.</i>

13:24.704 --> 13:26.406
Ow. Oh. Thanks.

13:26.539 --> 13:27.674
<i>Perhaps too much.</i>

13:28.275 --> 13:30.043
You are nothing.

13:30.177 --> 13:31.378
But you are in luck,

13:31.511 --> 13:33.813
because I am
an overflowing fountain

13:33.947 --> 13:36.549
ready to spill forth
my skills upon you.

13:36.683 --> 13:39.619
Yes! My baby's losing his mind
in service of my vision.

13:39.752 --> 13:41.321
We must walk
before we run.

13:41.454 --> 13:42.856
Actor's calisthenics!

13:43.756 --> 13:45.192
Stretch.

13:45.325 --> 13:46.659
<i>Yeah, I worked
those teachers to the bone.</i>

13:46.793 --> 13:48.428
No, it's more like this!

13:48.561 --> 13:49.796
<i>I loved every second of it.</i>

13:51.131 --> 13:54.001
You're sitting together,
but you're miles apart.

13:54.134 --> 13:56.003
Again!

13:56.136 --> 13:58.838
Oh, passe, Glascott.
Passe!

13:58.972 --> 14:01.641
No, no, no, no, no, no!
Jazz hands!

14:01.774 --> 14:03.944
You dance like
no one is watching.

14:04.077 --> 14:05.812
'Cause no one
can watch!

14:05.946 --> 14:07.247
<i>The rehearsals got
pretty brutal.</i>

14:07.380 --> 14:08.581
Again!

14:08.715 --> 14:10.250
<i>But soon...</i>
Okay, we can do this.

14:10.383 --> 14:12.119
<i>...my teachers started
to find their voice.</i>

14:12.252 --> 14:14.621
Fame <i>was actually
coming together.</i>

14:14.754 --> 14:17.457
Yes!
What is this incredible
high I'm feeling?

14:17.590 --> 14:18.591
It's <i>Fame!</i>

14:21.128 --> 14:22.062
Yes!

14:24.965 --> 14:26.666
I...

14:26.799 --> 14:27.834
Didn't hate it.

14:29.369 --> 14:30.870
We have to stay friends
after this!

14:31.004 --> 14:32.339
Yes!

14:32.472 --> 14:34.007
<i>If the
Senior-Sendoff came together,</i>

14:34.141 --> 14:36.643
<i>my sister's party
was popping off.</i>

14:36.776 --> 14:39.212
Sweet party.
D-Definitely an accurate
number of kegs

14:39.346 --> 14:40.613
in our modest
living space.

14:40.747 --> 14:43.383
And I like how our kitchen
is a mosh pit now.
Aah!

14:43.516 --> 14:44.817
For sure.
Very college.

14:44.952 --> 14:46.486
And I saw the guys
from Theta Beta

14:46.619 --> 14:48.455
hucking our throw pillows
out the window.

14:48.588 --> 14:49.689
I never should've told them
what they were called.

14:49.822 --> 14:51.824
This is nuts!

14:51.959 --> 14:53.726
A guy's got a whole
merch table set up,

14:53.860 --> 14:55.495
and I must be
kinda drunk,

14:55.628 --> 14:57.030
because I bought
this hideous shirt.

14:57.164 --> 14:58.598
That's mine,
but totally cool.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.833
The way I party,
I have no use
for them anymore.

15:00.968 --> 15:02.102
Ooh.

15:02.235 --> 15:03.570
<i>Yep,
neither Geoff nor Erica</i>

15:03.703 --> 15:05.672
<i>were gonna
put a stop to this...</i>
Cheers.

15:05.805 --> 15:08.341
<i>...so the insane game
of chicken only got worse.</i>

15:08.475 --> 15:10.643
Okay, uh...

15:10.777 --> 15:12.912
Seems like a good fight.
I'm gonna go this way.

15:13.046 --> 15:14.681
'Scuse me.
Aah!

15:14.814 --> 15:16.716
<i>Even though it was
an awesome hang,</i>

15:16.849 --> 15:18.485
<i>not everyone was loving it.</i>

15:19.819 --> 15:22.355
Hey. What are you
doing out here?

15:22.489 --> 15:24.891
Oh, I thought somebody
should pick these up.

15:25.025 --> 15:26.759
They were an engagement gift
from the Pasternaks.

15:26.893 --> 15:28.161
Josh and Melinda
are so thoughtful.

15:28.295 --> 15:30.097
I kind of needed
a minute, too.

15:30.230 --> 15:31.631
But you wanted
this party.

15:31.764 --> 15:32.932
Me? I thought you did.

15:33.066 --> 15:34.701
Are you kidding?

15:34.834 --> 15:37.637
The lacrosse team's
doing kamikazes off my cello
and calling it "cello shots."

15:37.770 --> 15:39.706
It's extremely clever,
but also destructive.

15:39.839 --> 15:42.609
I thought you needed me
to be the loose cannon
to balance you out.

15:42.742 --> 15:44.944
I thought it killed you that
Jean Jacobs and Tater

15:45.078 --> 15:46.913
and everyone else
are doing college right

15:47.047 --> 15:49.116
and we're just
engaged and boring.

15:49.249 --> 15:50.417
I thought it kills you

15:50.550 --> 15:52.285
that the fun girl
that you chased forever

15:52.419 --> 15:53.586
is a completely
different person now.

15:53.720 --> 15:54.988
What?
I don't know.

15:55.122 --> 15:56.223
I don't know, either.

15:56.356 --> 15:58.191
All I know is, this night
can't get any worse.

15:59.926 --> 16:03.230
Tater was right.
It didn't bounce at all.

16:03.363 --> 16:06.233
<i>While Erica
and Geoff's bash
got way out of control,</i>

16:06.366 --> 16:08.168
<i>the teachers couldn't
control their excitement</i>

16:08.301 --> 16:11.571
<i>to show off their hard work
and perform</i> Fame.

16:11.704 --> 16:13.040
Happy opening night,
Mama.

16:13.173 --> 16:14.807
Squishy!
You shouldn't have!

16:14.941 --> 16:17.410
Oh,
these are for me.

16:17.544 --> 16:19.379
One of the cast knows
how to treat their director.

16:19.512 --> 16:20.780
Never stop playing
the game.

16:20.913 --> 16:22.915
I heard there's already
a line to get in.

16:23.050 --> 16:26.153
See?
Tonight's gonna go down
in school history.

16:26.286 --> 16:27.754
Harrowing news,
everyone.

16:27.887 --> 16:30.923
I was minding my business
in the east hallway washroom,

16:31.058 --> 16:32.359
and I overheard
a sinister plot.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.761
The seniors are
going to, quote,

16:34.894 --> 16:37.630
"rag on those goofy teachers
until they cry."

16:37.764 --> 16:39.832
No way.
Yes way.

16:39.966 --> 16:42.502
Brian Corbett and Brian Walls
are gonna tear us apart.

16:42.635 --> 16:45.305
The Brians?
So popular and catty.

16:45.438 --> 16:46.839
Oh, and it wasn't
just them.

16:46.973 --> 16:48.941
There was a stream of pupils
entering and exiting,

16:49.076 --> 16:51.744
each one more mocking
than the next.

16:51.878 --> 16:57.184
Jason B., Xavier M.,
Rodney R., Jason B. again.

16:57.317 --> 16:59.052
All of those people
came in and out

16:59.186 --> 17:00.553
while you were in
the bathroom?

17:00.687 --> 17:02.822
Yes. We are lambs
for the slaughter.

17:02.955 --> 17:05.625
I'm just concerned about
how long you were
in the bathroom.

17:05.758 --> 17:07.460
You went before
we even broke for lunch.

17:07.594 --> 17:08.895
I thought he left
for the day.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.963
We all have our own ways
of managing pre-show jitters.

17:11.098 --> 17:12.965
I hope you at least
brought a book.

17:13.100 --> 17:15.168
Focus, people.
We're in real trouble here.

17:15.302 --> 17:16.669
We can't sing or dance,

17:16.803 --> 17:18.438
and look at these
form-fitting costumes.

17:18.571 --> 17:19.806
Way ahead of you.

17:19.939 --> 17:21.441
He's right.
I look like a pastry bag.

17:21.574 --> 17:22.875
What if a Brian
thinks I'm lame?

17:23.009 --> 17:24.811
I'm outie.
Me, too.

17:24.944 --> 17:26.479
So that's it?

17:26.613 --> 17:29.749
I'm sorry I wanted
to send these kids off
with something memorable

17:29.882 --> 17:32.919
that shows
how much their faculty
really cares about them.

17:35.155 --> 17:36.289
Bullet dodged.

17:36.423 --> 17:38.858
Or maybe
my mom is right.

17:38.991 --> 17:41.694
Sure, some Brians
would have laughed a little,

17:41.828 --> 17:44.331
but it would have meant a lot
to the rest of the seniors

17:44.464 --> 17:47.234
to see you guys celebrate
their time here.

17:47.367 --> 17:49.336
I know because
I'm one of them.

17:50.803 --> 17:53.506
Well, I'm still gonna
get topless.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.408
Helen, we were never doing
that part of the movie.

17:55.542 --> 17:56.509
What movie?

18:00.880 --> 18:03.550
<i>After forcing the faculty
into</i> Fame <i>and failing,</i>

18:03.683 --> 18:07.487
<i>my mom's dream for an epic
Teacher-Senior-Sendoff
was dead.</i>

18:07.620 --> 18:10.423
Well, I hope you're ready
for a joyless Quaker hymn.

18:10.557 --> 18:12.525
This one was written
200 years ago

18:12.659 --> 18:14.561
to thank God for
a bountiful harvest.

18:14.694 --> 18:18.030
So just close your eyes
and imagine that wheat.

18:18.165 --> 18:21.534
I know you're upset
about the whole
teacher goodbye thing.

18:21.668 --> 18:24.437
Damn it, why is Woodburn
blocking the drop-off line?

18:24.571 --> 18:26.038
This day's never gonna start.

18:26.173 --> 18:26.906
Hold on. Look.

18:28.408 --> 18:30.910
Wait.

18:31.043 --> 18:34.947
They're putting speakers
on top of the car
like that scene in <i>Fame!</i>

18:35.081 --> 18:36.949
You know what, Beverly?
You were right.

18:37.083 --> 18:39.952
These seniors deserve
the greatest show
of their lives.

18:40.086 --> 18:42.021
So we're gonna embarrass
the hell out of ourselves.

18:42.155 --> 18:43.423
Hit it!

18:45.425 --> 18:47.660
<i>And they really were.</i>

18:47.794 --> 18:50.430
This is the magical moment
I've always wanted.

18:50.563 --> 18:51.931
We're doing <i>Fame!</i>

18:52.064 --> 18:53.400
<i>♪ Fame</i>

18:53.533 --> 18:56.903
<i>♪ I'm gonna live forever</i>

18:57.036 --> 18:58.938

18:59.071 --> 19:00.106
<i>♪ High...</i>

19:00.240 --> 19:01.508
Check it.

19:01.641 --> 19:04.110
The teachers are <i>Fame</i> -ing
in the parking lot.

19:04.244 --> 19:07.280
My mind says "mock them,"
but my body says "join them."

19:07.414 --> 19:09.482
<i>That day,
the seniors got</i>

19:09.616 --> 19:12.419
<i>the most memorable sendoff
we ever could have imagined.</i>

19:12.552 --> 19:14.554
Darn it! I know
I said no to <i>Fame,</i>

19:14.687 --> 19:16.456
but even my broken body
is feeling the rhythm.

19:16.589 --> 19:18.491
<i>♪ Forever</i>

19:18.625 --> 19:20.927
<i>♪ Baby, remember my name</i>

19:21.060 --> 19:24.597
<i>♪ Remember, remember,

19:24.731 --> 19:25.965
<i>With my mom's help,</i>

19:26.098 --> 19:27.734
<i>a new tradition was born,</i>

19:27.867 --> 19:29.636
<i>but, then again,
shaking things up</i>

19:29.769 --> 19:32.305
<i>doesn't always work out
the way you wanted.</i>

19:32.439 --> 19:33.706
Well, it's official.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.808
Everything is either
missing or broken.

19:35.942 --> 19:37.510
For sure. And also,
why are there

19:37.644 --> 19:38.778
sheets on our bed
that aren't ours?

19:38.911 --> 19:41.514
So much destruction.
So much mystery.

19:42.749 --> 19:43.983
Look, about what I said...

19:45.151 --> 19:48.621
Sometimes I do wonder
if I'm missing out.

19:48.755 --> 19:51.958
And sometimes I worry
that it's because of me.

19:52.091 --> 19:54.994
No way. I love you,
and I love what we have.

19:55.127 --> 19:56.996
But you were, like,
this rock star

19:57.129 --> 19:58.531
living this super-fun life.

19:58.665 --> 19:59.632
Don't you miss that?

19:59.766 --> 20:00.967
Are you kidding me?

20:01.100 --> 20:02.835
If anything, I'd say
you're the rock star.

20:02.969 --> 20:04.571
Yeah, I don't see that.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.539
Geoff, you proposed
to me in college.

20:06.673 --> 20:07.707
That's badass, dude.

20:09.476 --> 20:10.877
I guess we are blazing
our own trail, huh?

20:11.010 --> 20:12.279
Totally.

20:12.412 --> 20:13.846
And if we want
to have more fun,

20:13.980 --> 20:16.383
it doesn't have to involve
furniture flying out windows.

20:16.516 --> 20:17.850
We could, like...

20:17.984 --> 20:20.520
Get some beers,
do karaoke with our friends?

20:20.653 --> 20:22.088
I'd love that.
Me, too.

20:24.624 --> 20:26.225
Wait, but what about
this mess?

20:26.359 --> 20:29.296
We're college kids.
We'll worry about it
tomorrow.

20:29.429 --> 20:32.131
<i>Sometimes,
the choices we make
in our lives feel scary.</i>

20:32.265 --> 20:33.733
<i>♪ Fame</i>

20:33.866 --> 20:36.903

20:41.140 --> 20:43.009
<i>that's when you find

20:43.142 --> 20:44.411
<i>♪ I feel it coming together...</i>

20:44.544 --> 20:46.245
<i>'Cause in the end,</i>

20:46.379 --> 20:47.847
<i>we don't have to live forever</i>

20:47.980 --> 20:50.583
<i>to make the most

20:50.717 --> 20:52.051

21:01.728 --> 21:02.695
<i>♪ Pray ♪</i>

21:04.431 --> 21:08.368
And the line of succession
is officially amended.

21:08.501 --> 21:09.969
Amended to what,
exactly?

21:10.102 --> 21:13.506
It goes principal, VP,
secretary of admissions,

21:13.640 --> 21:15.074
the district's
athletic director,

21:15.207 --> 21:16.676
our food services driver,

21:16.809 --> 21:18.678
every member of
our custodial staff,

21:18.811 --> 21:20.212
the crossing guard
with one arm,

21:20.347 --> 21:21.881
bus driver Tim,

21:22.014 --> 21:23.783
and the valedictorian
from grade eight.

21:23.916 --> 21:25.217
This all seems like a lot

21:25.352 --> 21:27.219
to keep me from
being in charge again.

21:27.354 --> 21:28.621
And yet, it's just
the right amount.
