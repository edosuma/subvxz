WEBVTT

00:00.700 --> 00:03.400
Tube socks or crew socks?

00:04.100 --> 00:06.400
What are we in the mood for tonight?

00:06.500 --> 00:08.500
Why are we using the royal we?

00:08.600 --> 00:13.200
I wonder if the post office keep records
of people's address changes.

00:13.300 --> 00:15.900
I mean, detectives track people down.
How do they do it?

00:16.000 --> 00:18.600
All right, it's official.
I've been on the night shift too long.

00:18.700 --> 00:21.700
We're talking to ourselves
like the other one's not there.

00:22.200 --> 00:24.500
I'm sorry.
Did you say something?

00:25.700 --> 00:27.400
What'd you say about a detective?

00:27.500 --> 00:28.500
Somethin' about your dad?

00:28.600 --> 00:30.000
Yeah. I can't track him down anywhere.

00:30.100 --> 00:33.300
Until I do, I won't know
how he lived all the esyears.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.900
Or how he died.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.400
Well, maybe he'll find you...
like he found you in that dream.

00:39.500 --> 00:41.800
Hmm. I could sure use his help.

00:42.200 --> 00:44.000
What for?

00:44.100 --> 00:46.500
Well, you know that ghost I was telling you about,

00:46.600 --> 00:48.100
the one at the city hall archives?

00:48.200 --> 00:50.500
Yeah, the one who acts
like he's guardin' the place.

00:50.600 --> 00:52.300
Yeah, he made all those weird threats about,

00:52.400 --> 00:54.700
you know, there being angry spirits down there

00:54.800 --> 00:57.100
and some serious darkness in grandview.

00:58.800 --> 01:01.100
All right, wait a minute.

01:01.300 --> 01:04.599
You're not really worried about us,
like we're in danger?

01:04.700 --> 01:08.400
Definitely not with jim clancy
out there in his uniform, so...

01:08.500 --> 01:09.800
hey. Easy.
- Go to work

01:09.900 --> 01:13.300
and don't come back
until people are healthy and safe.

01:14.100 --> 01:15.500
Go to work.

01:15.600 --> 01:17.900
Sleep well.

01:48.700 --> 01:50.800
Hey, al, there's a clear mirror over here.

01:50.900 --> 01:53.200
Yeah. Thanks.

02:00.300 --> 02:02.600
See ya.

02:20.100 --> 02:22.400
No.

02:26.800 --> 02:29.100
No!

02:31.200 --> 02:33.200
Hey.
- Oh. Hi.

02:33.300 --> 02:34.900
They told me you'd be up here.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.900
Are you ready for breakfast?
I'm buying?

02:37.000 --> 02:39.600
Thanks, but can i show you something first?

02:39.700 --> 02:41.200
Yeah, sure. What is it?

02:41.300 --> 02:45.700
Look, we brought this girl in with, uh,
amino acid catecholamines flooding her neurals,

02:45.800 --> 02:48.900
and that result was acute catatonia.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.900
That would have been really interesting
had it been in english.

02:52.500 --> 02:54.600
But see, it sounds a little crazy to say in english

02:54.700 --> 02:59.100
that I think- I think
this girl was almost scared to death.

02:59.400 --> 03:00.400
How?

03:00.500 --> 03:02.800
Washing her face in a bathroom.

03:03.200 --> 03:04.900
All right, according to one of her friends,

03:05.000 --> 03:07.900
before she lost consciousness,
the last words out of her mouth

03:08.200 --> 03:09.400
were, "bloody mary."

03:09.500 --> 03:11.700
Bloody mary? Like the drink?

03:11.800 --> 03:13.800
No, like bloody mary, the ghost.

03:13.900 --> 03:17.300
Oh, you mean bloody mary, the urban myth.

03:17.400 --> 03:21.400
I don't know. You're the expert.
You tell me.

04:04.500 --> 04:07.700
What really happened?
- Nobody saw.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.500
They're gonna run tests,
but the tox screens could take days.

04:10.600 --> 04:12.900
I mean, look at her face.

04:14.200 --> 04:16.500
Somethin' scared her.

04:19.100 --> 04:22.500
Bloody mary. What's the legend again?

04:22.600 --> 04:25.100
Well, you'd stand in a front of a mirror,
you call out her name,"bloody mary,"

04:25.200 --> 04:27.600
turn around a few times,
and then she comes through the mirror

04:27.900 --> 04:30.200
and scares you to death.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.800
Hey...what do you think?

04:40.900 --> 04:43.200
I don't know what to think.

04:43.400 --> 04:45.300
Tell me everything you know about bloody mary.

04:45.400 --> 04:49.300
Are you kidding me? You're, like, the 100th person
that's asked me about bloody mary today.

04:49.400 --> 04:51.200
All right. Well, news travels fast.

04:51.300 --> 04:52.800
Yeah, all over campus.

04:52.900 --> 04:54.200
It's like a full-blown mania.

04:54.300 --> 04:56.500
I have students clamoring to get into my class,

04:56.600 --> 05:00.600
and I have offered a little extra credit
for anyone that does the bloody mary ritual,

05:00.700 --> 05:02.800
and the first kid that dies,
I'm giving an automatic "A."

05:02.900 --> 05:04.800
Well, that's a little ghoulish, don't you think?

05:04.900 --> 05:06.800
Nah. I'm just riding the cyberwave.

05:06.900 --> 05:08.800
Cyberwave? What's a cyberwave?

05:08.900 --> 05:12.000
Ok, I know you live in the world of antiques
and dead things and dead people,

05:12.100 --> 05:14.500
but us, normal people that
live in the land of the living,

05:14.600 --> 05:18.600
we have this little invention that
we like to call...ready? Ta-da!

05:18.700 --> 05:21.800
The internet.
And bloody mary is all over it.

05:23.700 --> 05:27.600
Wait. So there are whole sites
devoted to one urban myth?

05:27.700 --> 05:30.400
Oh, yeah.
There's bloody mary sites all over the world.

05:30.500 --> 05:32.800
Whatever area the myth takes place in,

05:32.900 --> 05:35.100
well, you change the myth to fit local lore.

05:35.200 --> 05:37.100
So what's the rockland U. Version?

05:37.200 --> 05:39.100
Well, it starts the usual way.
You look into a mirror.

05:39.200 --> 05:41.500
You say her name a few times
over and over and over again,

05:41.600 --> 05:44.600
and then all of a sudden,
bloody mary appears behind you. Very scary.

05:44.700 --> 05:46.500
But then here's where the rockland U. Students,

05:46.600 --> 05:49.800
who I normally mock because their brains are
tiny, mushy, and unformed,

05:49.900 --> 05:53.600
they got very creative on me.
According to rubloodymary. Com,

05:53.700 --> 05:57.300
you go into some sort of suspended state
where you-you can't talk,

05:57.400 --> 06:00.500
you can't move for about 4 days,
and day after day,

06:00.600 --> 06:02.900
mary appears to you until you go mad,

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
and then on the fouth day, you die.
You're dead.

06:05.100 --> 06:08.400
And this is what they think will happen
to the girl who collapsed yesterday?

06:09.500 --> 06:11.800
Well, here's a hint.

06:25.400 --> 06:26.900
Hi. Excuse me.

06:27.000 --> 06:31.600
My name is melinda.
I'm so sorry to hear about allision.

06:31.700 --> 06:33.800
Could I talk to you guys for a second?

06:33.900 --> 06:35.000
Uh, who are you?

06:35.100 --> 06:38.100
M- my husband is the paramedic
who brought her in.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.800
Ok. What do you wanna know?

06:41.900 --> 06:44.600
Well, anything that you can remember.

06:45.900 --> 06:50.300
Did somebody hear her say, "bloody mary,"
right before she lost consciousness?

06:50.900 --> 06:55.200
Um, well, we weren't there,
so we don't know anything.

06:55.500 --> 06:59.900
We just came when we heard that allison, um,
that she-she got sick.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.100
Well, you can talk to me.
I'm not one of the police,

07:02.200 --> 07:04.600
and I don't work for the university, so...

07:04.700 --> 07:06.500
but we don't have anything to say.

07:06.600 --> 07:08.800
We weren't there, so we don't really know.

07:08.900 --> 07:11.200
She heard the noise.

07:12.100 --> 07:14.400
What noise?

07:20.400 --> 07:27.000
Um, I know that this may sound strange,
but if you're scared of, well, anything,

07:27.100 --> 07:29.700
I think that I might be able to help you,

07:29.800 --> 07:33.000
but you have to help me.
I need to know more about allison,

07:33.100 --> 07:37.900
like did anyone around her die recently,
like family or close friends?

07:38.000 --> 07:40.300
What does that have to do with anything?

07:40.600 --> 07:42.800
That's hard to explain.
- Ok, I don't mean to be rude,

07:42.900 --> 07:47.100
but unless you're a doctor or a family member,
you need to leave us alone.

07:53.400 --> 07:56.200
Ok, see, that is the thing about bloody mary.

07:56.300 --> 07:59.200
There are so many legends
that you can have 2 in one town.

07:59.300 --> 08:02.800
So there's the rockland U. Version,
and now there's a grandview version also?

08:02.900 --> 08:07.300
Yes, but technically the rockland university
version derives from the town version.

08:07.400 --> 08:09.300
I mean, that- that's why
my students went so crazy.

08:09.400 --> 08:11.800
When they found out they
had their own local ghost,

08:11.900 --> 08:14.000
I mean, they-are you sure
you don't wanna light candles?

08:14.100 --> 08:16.100
This story is way better with atmosphere.

08:16.200 --> 08:17.200
Positive.

08:17.300 --> 08:18.300
It would go a lot better with your new decor.

08:18.400 --> 08:19.800
Get to it.
- It's kind of dark.

08:19.900 --> 08:23.400
Ok, uh, look. Mary lived in grandview
about 150 years ago.

08:23.500 --> 08:25.800
She was a teenager, she got a disease,

08:26.100 --> 08:28.400
and she goes to the doctor
after slipping into a coma.

08:28.500 --> 08:30.800
The doctor declares her dead.
You know where this is going?

08:30.900 --> 08:32.200
To the end of the story.

08:32.299 --> 08:34.200
Anyway, mary goes into the ground,

08:34.299 --> 08:36.600
and they tie a string around her hand,
runs up to the surface,

08:36.700 --> 08:39.100
which is attached to a bell on top of the ground.

08:39.200 --> 08:41.600
That way, if she ever wakes up
'cause she's not really dead,

08:41.700 --> 08:43.000
then she-
- a dead ringer.

08:43.100 --> 08:46.600
Mmm. Melinda gordon, you listen.
I like that about you.

08:46.700 --> 08:51.200
Ok. So, mary's parents are so grief-stricken,
they really tie one on that night,

08:51.300 --> 08:53.700
and I don't mean tie one on
like a string around the hand.

08:53.800 --> 08:54.800
They get hammered.

08:54.900 --> 08:57.000
When they wake up the next morning,
they look at the bell.

08:57.100 --> 09:00.500
They see that the bell is-
as the kids say-off the hook.

09:00.600 --> 09:02.800
Huh? What are they gonna do?
They have to dig her back up.

09:02.900 --> 09:05.000
They open the coffin lid.
Except now it's way too late.

09:05.100 --> 09:07.100
She's really, really dead. And get this.

09:07.200 --> 09:11.600
On the inside of the coffin, there's
bloody scratch marks inside the coffin lid.

09:12.100 --> 09:13.900
That's it? You just go back to your I. M. Ing?

09:14.000 --> 09:15.200
You're like my students.

09:15.300 --> 09:17.100
Ok. So then it all makes sense.

09:17.200 --> 09:19.700
All the blogs started out by saying
that a bell would ring

09:19.800 --> 09:21.100
and then bloody mary would appear,

09:21.200 --> 09:23.300
which must be
what allison's friend in the hospital meant

09:23.400 --> 09:25.600
when she said that allison heard a noise.

09:25.700 --> 09:27.800
Ipso ghosto, you seem to be saying.

09:27.900 --> 09:30.600
Ok, so I do agree that it might
have something to do with a ghost.

09:30.700 --> 09:32.700
I did see something in allison's hospital room,

09:32.800 --> 09:36.100
but I definitely don't think
it has anything to do with bloody mary.

09:36.400 --> 09:39.000
Why would a century-old ghost
show up and terrorize coeds?

09:39.100 --> 09:41.600
Maybe she was tired of getting her bell rung.

09:42.100 --> 09:46.100
Whatever is
or isn't haunting allison is about her,

09:46.200 --> 09:48.600
but I-I'm not gonna know
what she saw until she wakes up.

09:48.700 --> 09:51.000
You mean if she wakes up.

09:51.100 --> 09:54.100
That myth does not prove
that anything is gonna happen.

09:56.800 --> 09:58.200
Jen, you gotta get real.

09:58.300 --> 10:00.800
If people are dumb enough to believe in ghosts,
then guess what.

10:00.900 --> 10:03.300
You know, it's like they deserve to
get scared out of their minds.

10:03.400 --> 10:05.400
It's like they basically asked for it.

10:05.500 --> 10:08.100
Allison did not ask for that.

10:08.200 --> 10:10.200
She's not in a coma
'cause she saw bloody mary.

10:10.300 --> 10:12.600
Please, would you please not say that name?

10:13.000 --> 10:15.300
Jen.

10:15.400 --> 10:17.700
Come on.

11:29.200 --> 11:30.800
No.

11:30.900 --> 11:33.200
Please don't do this.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.300
Please don'T.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.400
Hey, uh, I'm not an expert on this,

11:49.500 --> 11:51.900
but I'm pretty sure that's
what I would look like if I saw a ghost.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.900
How did you hear about this so fast?
I mean, is it already on the net?

11:55.000 --> 11:58.200
I came back to my office, and you know me.
I hear an ambulance, I come running.

11:59.700 --> 12:01.700
I'm pretty sure you told me
this wouldn't happen again, no?

12:01.800 --> 12:04.100
Will you just show me where it happened?

12:05.400 --> 12:09.000
I'm paid to be a skeptic.
I'm just running out of reasons to doubt the myth.

12:09.100 --> 12:11.700
Well, here's a reason. I see ghosts.
Other people don'T.

12:11.800 --> 12:15.500
Ok, but you're forgetting about the one element
that runs through all versions of the myth,

12:15.600 --> 12:17.000
and that's the mirrors.
- I'm not forgetting it.

12:17.100 --> 12:18.300
I'm ignoring it- the bell, the rest of it.

12:18.400 --> 12:20.100
It all makes a good story.
It doesn't make it real.

12:20.200 --> 12:24.000
Excuse me. Sir,
that car is being examined by campus security.

12:24.100 --> 12:26.900
It's ok. I'm-I'm rick payne,
anthropology of the occult.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.300
I'll take it from here.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.300
Where are we going?

12:31.400 --> 12:33.500
This is it. We're here.
This is where jenna was found.

12:33.600 --> 12:34.800
And while we're on
the subject of things you don't know,

12:34.900 --> 12:37.200
let me give you my condensed lecture on mirrors

12:37.300 --> 12:39.700
and their place throughout history
and the supernatural.

12:39.800 --> 12:40.800
Like the first queen elizabeth,

12:40.900 --> 12:44.500
she had her own personal magician
who would use a mirror to describe the future.

12:44.600 --> 12:46.700
And the greeks.
Don't even get me started on the greeks.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.300
Uh, this is the condensed version?

12:48.400 --> 12:50.100
Yes, but you just made it a little bit longer.

12:50.200 --> 12:52.400
The greeks thought
that any reflective surface would do.

12:52.500 --> 12:54.300
They even believe that unsuspecting, uh,

12:54.400 --> 12:58.400
souls could be pulled underwater
by evil spirits lurking underneath the water.

12:58.600 --> 12:59.900
Why?

13:00.000 --> 13:01.500
Did you just do a flourish?

13:01.600 --> 13:03.200
I guess I did. I'll tell u yowhy.

13:03.300 --> 13:07.300
Because cultures throughout space and time
have always believed that mirrors are, uh,

13:07.400 --> 13:10.300
sort of a veil between our world and others.

13:11.100 --> 13:12.800
Uh, a portal, if you will.

13:12.900 --> 13:16.400
Ok, so let's say
that bloody mary uses mirrors as portals.

13:16.600 --> 13:17.900
One problem.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.300
Where's the mirror in here?

13:28.100 --> 13:30.400
D saveby the bell.

13:31.100 --> 13:35.100
Wow. Ok, who's opening whose mind now?

13:35.200 --> 13:37.600
Who you gonna call the next time
you have a ghost pluggin' up your works?

13:37.700 --> 13:40.100
Who I should have called all along.

13:40.800 --> 13:46.300
Ok, we could do this face to face,
but mirrors are your thing.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.300
Bloody mary.

13:55.500 --> 13:57.800
Bloody mary.

13:58.400 --> 14:00.700
Bloody mary.

14:09.800 --> 14:12.100
Mel, are you down here?

14:13.400 --> 14:17.000
Hey, what do you wanna do
with this greatart nouveau clock?

14:17.400 --> 14:19.500
Are you ok? You look like you just saw a-

14:19.600 --> 14:22.000
nothing. Nope. Didn't see a thing.

14:31.800 --> 14:33.900
I thought so.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.800
You were calling her, weren't you,
that ghost of bloody mary?

14:37.900 --> 14:39.000
How do you know about her?

14:39.100 --> 14:40.800
Are you kidding?
Every time I go to check my e-mail,

14:40.900 --> 14:44.300
my son's got the browser on that page.
All his friends are into it.

14:44.400 --> 14:45.800
It's all so ridiculous.

14:45.900 --> 14:49.000
Why do these kids wanna do this?
- What, scare themselves?

14:49.300 --> 14:51.400
Just like goin' on a roller coaster, I guess.

14:51.500 --> 14:53.100
You have to face something that feels like death,

14:53.200 --> 14:56.400
you come out the other side,
and then suddenly you feel so alive.

14:56.500 --> 14:58.500
Ha! I found you! You were lying.

14:58.600 --> 14:59.600
What?

14:59.700 --> 15:02.500
Well, it'sme com ant page.
They're all talking about what happened to jenna.

15:02.600 --> 15:04.000
Look at what this person says.

15:04.100 --> 15:05.900
"Stop it. You guys are making it worse.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.400
"How many people do you want to get hurt
before you learn? Signed "S. A."

15:08.500 --> 15:13.500
Now if I go to jenna's webpage,
check out her B. F. F. S.

15:13.600 --> 15:15.200
Allison, some girl named claire,

15:15.300 --> 15:17.100
and sloane alexander, the friend from the hospital,

15:17.200 --> 15:20.100
who told me she didn't know anything about
bloody mary.

15:20.600 --> 15:22.900
And here's sloane's website.

15:24.300 --> 15:26.800
Whoa. Did you see that?

15:27.200 --> 15:29.900
See what?
- I gotta get down there.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.300
Yeah? Who-

15:53.700 --> 15:56.000
it's you.

16:00.900 --> 16:05.600
This is gonna sound strange,
but I know a few things about ghosts.

16:08.400 --> 16:10.700
You're not laughing.

16:10.900 --> 16:12.900
I'm so sorry. I'm not used to that.

16:13.000 --> 16:17.300
I have 2 friends in the hospital.
I'm probably next. You were saying?

16:17.400 --> 16:20.200
Ok. Well, first of all, most of the things

16:20.300 --> 16:23.600
that people are saying about bloody mary
are very unlikely.

16:23.700 --> 16:26.900
Ancient spirits don't usually jump out of mirrors
and try to kill people.

16:27.700 --> 16:32.700
Number 2, ghosts can scare you, but they
can't do more than that unless you let them.

16:34.400 --> 16:36.600
We can stop this together,

16:36.700 --> 16:39.000
but you have to help me figure out who she is

16:39.100 --> 16:41.400
and-and why she would wanna do this to you.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.700
For a second there, I actually believed you.

16:43.800 --> 16:46.300
I actually thought I might be ok.

16:46.400 --> 16:48.600
You will be ok.

16:48.700 --> 16:50.400
You just have to help me find the connection.

16:50.500 --> 16:51.900
Why should I help you?

16:52.000 --> 16:54.100
You don't know what you're talking about.

16:54.200 --> 16:56.500
You're wrong about everything.

16:56.600 --> 16:59.700
The legend is all true, every detail.

16:59.800 --> 17:02.400
You call bloody mary, you hear the bell,

17:02.600 --> 17:04.900
she comes through the mirror,
and then you die.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.900
Yeah, but no one has died.
It's just a story.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
You're wrong. Rachel died.
I was there when it happened.

17:11.800 --> 17:14.300
Rachel? Who's rachel?

17:15.900 --> 17:18.200
She was one of jenna's suitemates.

17:19.599 --> 17:23.800
Just before semester break,
we were talking about blogs and stuff,

17:24.000 --> 17:25.599
what kids were saying about bloody mary.

17:25.700 --> 17:27.099
She's real.

17:27.200 --> 17:30.000
Allison, though, she was, like, obsessed,

17:30.400 --> 17:33.900
especially when she heard that the real
bloody mary had actually lived in grandview

17:34.000 --> 17:36.500
and her parents were founders of the college.

17:36.600 --> 17:40.500
And allison swore a roommate of
her ex-boyfriend's had actually seen the ghost.

17:40.600 --> 17:42.600
And when he looked up in the mirror,

17:42.700 --> 17:46.600
bloody mary was, like, staring right back at him.

17:46.700 --> 17:49.800
Shut up. You are such a liar.

17:49.900 --> 17:52.200
I swear it.
- Prove it.

17:54.700 --> 17:57.000
I dare you.

17:57.100 --> 17:59.400
Go on.

17:59.600 --> 18:02.300
You go do it.
- Are you kidding me?

18:02.800 --> 18:05.100
I'll do it.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.900
We were kind of impressed, actually.

18:24.600 --> 18:25.600
Good luck.

18:25.700 --> 18:28.100
She was the only one who had the guts.

18:28.600 --> 18:31.300
The rest of us couldn't get out of
the bathroom fast enough.

18:48.800 --> 18:51.100
Bloody mary.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.800
Bloody mary.

18:58.300 --> 19:00.600
Bloody mary.

19:30.900 --> 19:34.600
Rachel went into a coma, and 4 days later, she died.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.700
I've never heard any of this.

19:37.800 --> 19:38.900
Well, it was last spring,

19:39.000 --> 19:43.500
and the university doesn't exactly
advertise unexpldened aiaths on campus.

19:44.600 --> 19:47.600
For wha ile, people thought maybe
it was a drug overdose.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.300
But you knew better.

19:49.400 --> 19:51.300
We were so scared.

19:51.400 --> 19:54.000
We made a pact to never tell anyone
how it happened,

19:54.100 --> 19:56.700
but then when we came back after semester break,

19:57.400 --> 19:59.900
all this weird stuff started to happen.

20:00.800 --> 20:03.600
It was like mary knew we were back...

20:04.500 --> 20:06.800
like she was watching us.

20:07.500 --> 20:09.400
There were all these weird noises.

20:09.500 --> 20:11.700
There was stuff
we thought we were seeing in mirrors.

20:11.800 --> 20:15.700
And you think all this happened
because you called out a ghost's name?

20:15.800 --> 20:18.000
Well, rachel called her, but it was our idea,

20:18.100 --> 20:20.800
and now mary's coming for everyone there
who helped wake her up.

20:20.900 --> 20:22.400
Look, I understand how you feel-

20:22.500 --> 20:25.600
no, you don'T. You don't understand anything.

20:26.900 --> 20:29.200
Ok, maybe I don'T.

20:31.300 --> 20:33.400
But will you at least let me help you?

20:33.500 --> 20:35.800
You don't have to do this alone.

20:36.200 --> 20:37.300
No, it's too late now.

20:37.400 --> 20:39.400
My best friends are gone, and I'm probably next,

20:39.500 --> 20:42.000
and anyone I told would think I was nuts.

20:43.100 --> 20:44.800
Sloane, please don't do this.

20:44.900 --> 20:47.200
I'm sorry. I need you to go.

20:48.800 --> 20:51.100
Ok, well, if you change your mind-

21:14.400 --> 21:16.500
good morning.
- Hey.

21:16.600 --> 21:21.500
Hey, you know, it turns out everything
sloane told you about rachel checks out.

21:21.600 --> 21:23.800
She was picked up in kirkfield hall,

21:23.900 --> 21:26.200
unresponsive, transferred to mercy,

21:26.700 --> 21:29.000
declared comatose, and she died 4 days later.

21:29.100 --> 21:31.400
So what was the cause of death?

21:31.800 --> 21:34.100
Complications from heart failure.

21:34.400 --> 21:36.900
Is it relyal possible to be scared to death.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.200
Yeah, sure, if it's bad enough.

21:39.300 --> 21:43.000
You get this flood of chemicals to your heart,
creates a shock some people can't survive.

21:47.400 --> 21:49.900
Aw, that's just delightful.
- Oh, it gets worse.

21:53.700 --> 21:54.700
Look, also,

21:54.800 --> 21:58.600
my buddy at the hospital told me jenna
is showing exactly the same symptoms as allison,

21:58.700 --> 21:59.800
just a day later.

21:59.900 --> 22:00.900
We haven't had a single test positive

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
for any medical cause for their catatonic states.

22:04.100 --> 22:06.200
Well, all the rumors online are getting crazy.

22:06.300 --> 22:08.200
It's like this thing has a life of its own.

22:08.300 --> 22:11.700
Oh, babe, I don't ntwa to tell you your job.
I won't do that.

22:12.100 --> 22:13.900
But we got the 2 girls in the hospital.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.900
They're serious.
There's no other explanation.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.300
Is it possible it could be the myth?
- Yes.

22:18.500 --> 22:20.100
Yes, of course. Anything is possible,

22:20.200 --> 22:23.000
and if anything, my job has taught me that,
but I'm sorry.

22:23.400 --> 22:25.700
I don't believe it.

22:25.900 --> 22:27.100
You don't believe it, or you don't want to?

22:27.200 --> 22:28.500
What does that mean?

22:28.600 --> 22:29.800
All it means is if it's true,

22:29.900 --> 22:33.300
there's a whole lot more to this ghost world
than you got a handle on.

22:33.700 --> 22:35.300
You know, if it's true, maybe your-

22:35.400 --> 22:38.200
your ghost down in the archives
is tellin' the truth.

22:38.300 --> 22:41.700
What, that there's some kind of
darkness in grandview?

22:42.400 --> 22:44.700
Yeah.

22:51.400 --> 22:53.700
Hey. Remember me?

22:54.400 --> 22:56.800
I need to do some research on a girl
who might have been buried-

22:56.900 --> 22:59.500
don't tell me. Bloody mary.

22:59.600 --> 23:02.100
Well, if that's actually who she was, then yes.

23:02.200 --> 23:06.900
For the 10,000th time today,
there are no such records I know of,

23:07.000 --> 23:09.500
so kindly look elsewhere.

23:09.800 --> 23:12.200
Um, no.
- No?

23:12.700 --> 23:16.000
No. This is public property.
Those are public records,

23:16.100 --> 23:19.000
and I am the public,
so unless you wanna declare martial law,

23:19.100 --> 23:21.400
I'm gonna be going this way.

23:42.800 --> 23:45.400
You're plucky. You're gutsy.

23:46.600 --> 23:49.900
Those are excellent traits in a person
who wants to get badly hurt.

23:50.100 --> 23:51.500
Yeah, you told me that before.

23:51.600 --> 23:53.200
Now, you hear what i just said to the archivist.

23:53.300 --> 23:54.400
What do you wanna tell me?

23:54.500 --> 23:57.400
You can't just leave the dead to rest, can you?

23:57.500 --> 23:59.900
I'll let them rest when they let me rest.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Do you know something or not?

24:02.100 --> 24:04.400
She's real...

24:04.700 --> 24:06.700
but not everything you've heard is true.

24:06.800 --> 24:11.000
Some of the most...
interesting details are missing.

24:11.100 --> 24:12.100
Such as?

24:12.200 --> 24:15.800
Well, I'm sure you've heard that
the doctor wrglyon pronounced mary dead,

24:16.900 --> 24:19.200
but do you know who the doctor was?

24:20.100 --> 24:21.700
It was mary's own father.

24:21.800 --> 24:24.100
They lived in the big house on oak shadow lane.

24:24.200 --> 24:27.500
It's empty now,
but it was once the home of dr. Horace mumford,

24:27.600 --> 24:31.200
his wife, and their only child, mary.

24:31.800 --> 24:33.300
Poor mary had diptheria,

24:33.400 --> 24:37.700
which was incurable in those days,
not to mention extremely contagious.

24:38.000 --> 24:41.300
Dr. Mumford
felt they had tobury his daughter right away.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.700
With the chance that the bell might ring,

24:53.800 --> 24:55.900
mary's mother wodul not leave the grave.

24:56.000 --> 25:00.200
Well, the good doctor knew that she would die
of exposure if she didn't come inside.

25:02.100 --> 25:04.400
Luckily, he had some morphine.

25:34.700 --> 25:37.000
Well, you know the rest.

25:37.300 --> 25:39.600
By the time they got to mary,

25:40.100 --> 25:43.500
she was dead...by the doctor's own hand.

25:43.800 --> 25:45.700
You're right. I shouldn't have asked.

25:45.800 --> 25:47.200
Wait.

25:47.300 --> 25:49.600
You'll miss the best part.

25:50.300 --> 25:53.100
You see, when they finally got mary up,
her hands were so...

25:53.900 --> 25:55.200
bloody,

25:55.300 --> 25:57.600
they missed it at first.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.300
Mary's nails were gone.

26:05.700 --> 26:08.400
They were stuck in the lid of the coffin.

26:19.600 --> 26:23.300
Mary. Are you here?

26:24.700 --> 26:28.200
I just wanna talk to you.

26:29.000 --> 26:32.200
Don't you wanna talk to someone
after all these years?

26:37.200 --> 26:38.400
Hello.

26:38.500 --> 26:41.300
Are you catatonic yet?
- Ah, practically.

26:41.400 --> 26:44.500
I was wondering if you were ever gonna
call me back. Did you get me in?

26:44.600 --> 26:46.300
Well, as it turns out,

26:46.400 --> 26:50.600
bloody mary's ancestral home is one of
grandview's registered historic buildings,

26:50.700 --> 26:54.000
and the preservation society is run
by the chair of our architecture school,

26:54.100 --> 26:57.900
who is a very bad poker player,
and he owes me $138.

26:58.000 --> 27:01.600
By the way,
the combination to the key box is k-e-Y.

27:01.700 --> 27:03.800
So I guess now I owe you a favor.

27:03.900 --> 27:06.300
Yeah, and $138.

27:23.700 --> 27:26.000
Mary.

27:43.600 --> 27:45.900
Why won't you show yourself?

27:50.500 --> 27:52.800
I know you're here.

27:55.900 --> 27:58.500
I know that we've been in the same efom broore.

28:08.500 --> 28:11.900
Ok. If these are the rules...

28:13.500 --> 28:15.800
bloody mary.

28:17.200 --> 28:19.500
Bloody mary.

28:21.700 --> 28:24.000
Bloody mary.

28:48.800 --> 28:51.100
Do you know what happened to you?

28:51.500 --> 28:53.800
Do you know why you're here?

28:54.700 --> 28:57.000
Why aren't you looking at me?

29:08.900 --> 29:12.200
I don't believe it. You-
you actually saw bloody mary,

29:12.300 --> 29:13.300
the- the real thing?

29:13.400 --> 29:14.500
Well, I don't know if I believe it either.

29:14.600 --> 29:17.100
I mean, I was at her family home.
I said her name 3 times.

29:17.200 --> 29:20.400
She appeared. Her hands were bloody.

29:20.900 --> 29:22.500
But what?

29:22.600 --> 29:24.400
She had all her fingernails.

29:24.500 --> 29:26.600
Maybe the archive ghost got his facts wrong.

29:26.700 --> 29:28.000
Yeah, maybe, but there's something else.

29:28.100 --> 29:31.000
The bell, it sounded off, you know,

29:31.100 --> 29:33.200
like it didn't sound like a 100-year-old bell.

29:33.300 --> 29:36.200
Well, honey, I don't think
cast-iron bell technology has changed much.

29:36.300 --> 29:37.600
No, it didn't sound real.

29:37.700 --> 29:39.100
You know, clipped, like-

29:39.200 --> 29:42.700
like it was a recording.
I don't think this is a century-old ghost.

29:42.900 --> 29:45.200
All right, you're back to believing
the ghost is someone who knew the girls,

29:45.300 --> 29:47.100
someone who died,
someone who had unfinished business.

29:47.200 --> 29:49.500
Yes.
- Yep.

29:49.600 --> 29:51.600
No.
- No.

29:51.700 --> 29:53.600
Not someone who knew the girls.

29:53.700 --> 29:55.100
One of the girls.

29:55.200 --> 29:58.700
Look, 4 girls played bloody mary that night.
2 are catatonic,

29:58.800 --> 30:01.900
one is convinced that she's next,
but only one girl died,

30:02.000 --> 30:04.500
the first one, rachel.

30:06.400 --> 30:10.500
You're saying that our daughter
rachel died from playing what?

30:10.600 --> 30:15.000
Well, it's kind of a ghost story that was spread

30:15.100 --> 30:17.700
and now has taken on a life of its own.

30:17.800 --> 30:18.900
I- I'm sorry. Miss, uh...

30:19.000 --> 30:20.500
melinda.

30:20.600 --> 30:22.500
We sent our daughter to college.

30:22.600 --> 30:27.200
We let her live in the dorm,
even though we were a half-hour drive away

30:27.300 --> 30:29.000
and-which I knew was a big mistake.

30:29.100 --> 30:30.100
Bill, please.

30:30.200 --> 30:32.500
And the first time we go to pick her up...

30:33.700 --> 30:36.000
we're sent to a county morgue.

30:36.100 --> 30:40.300
I wouldn't ask you to remember any of this
if it weren't for her friends at the hospital.

30:40.500 --> 30:41.900
They need your help.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
What can we do?
- I don't know.

30:44.100 --> 30:47.700
I was hoping to find out
more information about the relationship.

30:47.800 --> 30:50.900
Well, she never mentioned any of those names.
Jenna? Allison?

30:51.000 --> 30:54.300
No. Rachel had a hard time making friends.

30:54.400 --> 30:55.900
And why was that?

30:56.000 --> 30:58.800
My wife will tell you that that was my fault.

30:58.900 --> 31:04.500
Well, that's not-
rachel was different from other kids.

31:04.700 --> 31:06.500
How?
- Her heart.

31:06.600 --> 31:07.900
She had a V. S. D.

31:08.000 --> 31:11.800
It's a septal defect, a hole between the chambers.

31:12.700 --> 31:13.700
And she knew about that?

31:13.800 --> 31:15.400
From the time that she was a child,

31:15.500 --> 31:17.300
which was why
we could not allow her to play sports.

31:17.400 --> 31:20.500
She had to be home-schooled.
We took every precaution.

31:20.600 --> 31:24.200
I don't mean to pry, but did
your daughter by any chance wear a heart monitor?

31:24.300 --> 31:25.700
Absolutely, 24 hours a day.

31:25.800 --> 31:26.900
And how did it work?

31:27.000 --> 31:29.900
When her heart got too stressed,
it would emit a sound.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.400
What kind of sound?

31:31.500 --> 31:33.800
You know, like an alarm.

31:40.100 --> 31:42.400
Sloane.

31:46.200 --> 31:48.500
What are you doing here?

31:49.900 --> 31:51.900
I can help you now.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.700
It doesn't matter. I'm leaving school.

31:55.100 --> 31:57.600
My parents are coming from maine.
They're picking me up tomorrow.

31:57.700 --> 31:59.000
Yeah, but you don't have to do this.

31:59.100 --> 32:02.300
Bloody mary is not after you.
The ghost is rachel.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.300
What?
- I called her.

32:05.400 --> 32:08.000
She came. I heard the bell.
I saw the bloody hands.

32:08.100 --> 32:12.000
I saw what jenna and allison saw,
and I'm still here to talk to you about it.

32:12.300 --> 32:13.800
You're gonna be dead in 4 days.

32:13.900 --> 32:16.900
No. That's how long rachel
was in a coma before she died,

32:17.000 --> 32:18.500
and there's a reason for that.

32:18.600 --> 32:19.800
Rachel had a heart condition,

32:19.900 --> 32:23.100
and the excitement or the fear or whatever it is
that happened in that bathroom,

32:23.200 --> 32:25.500
it was too much for her body to take.

32:28.100 --> 32:29.300
But I heard the bell.

32:29.400 --> 32:31.600
No, what you heard was her heart monitor.

32:31.700 --> 32:34.900
She had a condition,
and the scare is what killed her.

32:37.600 --> 32:39.900
Oh, my god.

32:40.600 --> 32:42.500
That's why she did it.

32:42.600 --> 32:44.400
That's why she did what?

32:44.500 --> 32:47.700
That's why she came for us.
That's why she's saving me for last.

32:48.300 --> 32:50.900
When allison said
she knew someone who'd seen bloody mary,

32:51.000 --> 32:53.200
I thought she was just lying to scare us,

32:53.300 --> 32:55.700
so why not return the favor? Right?

32:55.800 --> 32:58.900
But I figured allison or jenna
would take the dare, but...

33:00.100 --> 33:02.400
then it was rachel.

33:02.500 --> 33:04.100
She was so quiet.

33:04.200 --> 33:09.600
You know, I barely even knew her,
and then just out of nowhere, she just steps up.

33:21.800 --> 33:24.800
Ok, I'm bored already. I'm gonna go to bed.

33:25.400 --> 33:27.700
Whatever.
- Whatever.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.300
Bloody mary.

33:31.800 --> 33:34.100
Bloody mary.

33:39.600 --> 33:41.900
Bloody mary.

34:05.100 --> 34:08.300
Allison and jenna didn'tve en know what I'd done.

34:09.000 --> 34:12.199
But I didn't-I didn't mean to hurt anyone.

34:12.300 --> 34:14.400
Yeah, but rachel didn't know that.

34:14.500 --> 34:17.199
So I did this. I killed her.

34:17.300 --> 34:19.000
It was an accident,

34:19.100 --> 34:21.600
and I know that,
but we have to make sure that rachel knows that.

34:21.699 --> 34:24.000
She needs your help to move on.

34:25.900 --> 34:28.199
You say that like...

34:29.900 --> 34:30.900
is she here?

34:31.000 --> 34:35.100
No, but I think I know where she might be.
Where did it happen?

34:35.199 --> 34:37.500
In the hall bathroom.

34:38.600 --> 34:40.800
Come on.

34:40.900 --> 34:43.199
Sloane.

34:43.800 --> 34:46.100
I can'T.

34:52.699 --> 34:54.800
Rachel...

34:54.900 --> 34:58.900
I know who you are and how you died.

35:21.700 --> 35:24.000
Please let me help you.

35:57.500 --> 35:59.000
Rachel, stop it. Stop it!

35:59.100 --> 36:00.400
They killed me.

36:00.500 --> 36:02.900
You took a dare that went wrong.
That's what happened.

36:03.100 --> 36:05.900
Left for dead...by you.

36:06.100 --> 36:08.400
Sloane didn't know
that you were gonna take that dare.

36:08.600 --> 36:10.900
None of them did. You have to forgive them.

36:11.400 --> 36:14.800
Doesn't matter now. They called my name.

36:15.100 --> 36:18.200
Your name is rachel. You're not bloody mary.

36:18.300 --> 36:21.600
She was a different girl buried alive
by her parents.

36:24.200 --> 36:26.500
So was I.

36:28.200 --> 36:31.300
Wait. I don't see her.
Is she gone? Is it over?

36:31.700 --> 36:36.000
Not yet, but I think I know where I can find her.

36:42.500 --> 36:45.900
I can't find it. Where is it?

36:46.500 --> 36:50.400
Your grave's not here, rachel.
This was never your home.

36:50.700 --> 36:53.100
You have to remember who you really are.

36:53.500 --> 36:56.700
You have to remember how this all started.
Look at your hands.

36:59.800 --> 37:03.300
You were holding a glass,
and it broke in your hand.

37:03.900 --> 37:06.500
Your heart stopped because you were scared.

37:09.700 --> 37:11.100
I couldn't breathe.

37:11.200 --> 37:13.900
Felt like an empty, cold box in my chest.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.800
Then I saw her, sloane...

37:24.000 --> 37:27.800
Saw how I scared her, how I scared them all.

37:37.600 --> 37:41.900
And that fear that they felt,
I knew that feeling so well.

37:42.500 --> 37:44.800
And they look at me now,

37:45.100 --> 37:47.700
and they're the ones who are frozen in fear.

37:48.500 --> 37:50.800
You mean allison and jenna.

37:52.600 --> 37:54.400
I'm with them all the time.

37:54.500 --> 37:58.300
I can go anywhere, do anything.

37:58.800 --> 38:02.500
I never have to rest, and my parents,

38:03.200 --> 38:05.500
they can't stop me anymore.

38:05.800 --> 38:08.300
So that's why you understood mary.

38:09.700 --> 38:12.500
You knew what it was like to be buried alive.

38:13.500 --> 38:16.200
But somewhere along the way,
you lost who you really are

38:16.400 --> 38:20.100
and who you were to everybody
who really loved you.

38:22.300 --> 38:24.300
I can help you,

38:24.400 --> 38:26.800
but you have to let mary go.

38:33.800 --> 38:35.000
I know it's hard to accept.

38:35.100 --> 38:39.200
I don't care if you think
that you can see spirits or-or ufos.

38:39.300 --> 38:41.600
I've heard enough.

38:43.800 --> 38:46.200
Tell him I drove his snowmobile into a tree.

38:46.900 --> 38:51.300
She wants you to know that
she drove your snowmobile into a tree.

38:52.900 --> 38:58.400
Oh, my god. She was only 13.

39:02.200 --> 39:04.700
Lisa... what's she talking about?

39:06.000 --> 39:08.100
There was a blizzard.

39:08.200 --> 39:11.600
Dad said I couldn't go outside,
but mom could tell I was just dying,

39:11.700 --> 39:13.900
watching all the snow pile up.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.300
She made me promise never to tell.

39:16.600 --> 39:19.200
She let me drive the snowmobile around the yard.

39:19.800 --> 39:21.800
That was a bad idea.

39:21.900 --> 39:24.600
There was a snowstorm, and...

39:24.700 --> 39:27.700
I let her drive your snowmobile.

39:28.500 --> 39:32.800
I thought she'd be sitting
and her heart would be safe.

39:37.900 --> 39:40.200
This is gonna sound really lame, but

39:40.400 --> 39:43.000
I think that was the best day of my life.

39:43.700 --> 39:47.500
She wants to thank you for that day.

39:48.100 --> 39:52.000
Oh, yeah. I suppose she's grateful
that we let her live in the dorm, too.

39:53.100 --> 39:55.400
Tell him safety is overrated.

39:55.600 --> 39:58.600
She said that safety is overrated.

39:59.700 --> 40:04.500
Sometimes it's better to let things go,
no matter what happens.

40:05.800 --> 40:09.400
I let go of rachel, and look what I got.

40:09.500 --> 40:13.000
Tell him that he gave me the best gift
he could ever give me,

40:14.100 --> 40:16.400
my freedom.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.300
She knows you miss her,

40:19.400 --> 40:23.000
but she wants you to understand
how happy you made her.

40:23.600 --> 40:25.900
I...

40:28.300 --> 40:30.600
I didn't want her happy.

40:31.200 --> 40:33.500
I wanted her alive.

40:34.100 --> 40:37.200
And I was, thanks to them.

40:37.300 --> 40:39.000
She was alive.

40:39.100 --> 40:41.400
You gave that to her.

40:47.600 --> 40:51.300
She's right. Listen to rachel.

41:00.900 --> 41:03.200
Is she here?

41:04.300 --> 41:06.600
Is it safe now?

41:08.200 --> 41:12.000
Um, this is sloane.
She went to school with rachel.

41:12.800 --> 41:15.500
She looks just as scared as I was.

41:16.100 --> 41:18.400
Is that how you want her to stay?

41:20.100 --> 41:22.400
She forgives you.

41:29.100 --> 41:30.900
Do you see this?

41:31.000 --> 41:32.900
This light, are you feeling this?

41:33.000 --> 41:36.500
No. It's just for you.

41:39.600 --> 41:41.300
What is she saying?

41:41.400 --> 41:43.700
She's saying she's free now.

41:44.600 --> 41:46.900
She's saying good-bye.

41:51.800 --> 41:54.100
It's ok.

42:56.300 --> 42:59.500
Hey. I hope you're happy.
Are you happy?

42:59.600 --> 43:01.300
Uh, generally yes. Why?

43:01.400 --> 43:03.600
'Cause those comatose girls
have now woken up because of you,

43:03.700 --> 43:07.200
and rubloodymary. Com gets,
like, 5 hits a day, mostly from me.

43:07.300 --> 43:09.100
And the crickets have returned to my classroom.

43:09.200 --> 43:12.000
I'm doing my lectures for nobody, practically, ok,

43:12.100 --> 43:15.000
and the stark,
raving terror that had this town in its grips

43:15.100 --> 43:17.100
is now just gone, all because of you.

43:17.200 --> 43:20.100
Well, I'm so sorry.
I should've known how it would affect you.

43:20.700 --> 43:23.900
You know, I was thinking of letting
you skate on that $138 you owe me,

43:24.000 --> 43:26.300
but now I've changed my mind, so pay up.

43:26.600 --> 43:30.600
Sorry. No cash.
But you can take your payment in kind.

43:31.000 --> 43:32.800
What, something from here?
Some of this junk?

43:32.900 --> 43:34.100
Do I have blue hair?

43:34.200 --> 43:36.200
Do I live at the end of the block with 15 cats?

43:36.300 --> 43:38.900
Forget it. You owe me $138.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.300
This is me leaving disgruntled.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.500
Hiya, jim.
- Hey.

43:45.800 --> 43:47.700
What time is our reservation?

43:47.800 --> 43:50.100
8:00. We're good.

43:50.700 --> 43:53.200
You know what? I think maybe we are.
