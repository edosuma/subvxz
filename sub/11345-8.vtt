00:41.609 --> 00:43.277
OR ANYONE ELSE
FOR THAT MATTER, OKAY?

00:43.311 --> 00:45.279
- CHILLAX.
I THOUGHT IT'D BE FUNNY.

00:45.313 --> 00:46.380

SORRY TO BARGE IN

01:37.265 --> 01:39.167
AND WHO MIGHT YOU BE?

01:39.200 --> 01:40.734
- IS THIS YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

01:40.768 --> 01:43.904
- NO. AGENT LEWIS
WORKS FOR THE FBI.

01:43.937 --> 01:46.740
SHE'S HERE TO ARREST YOU.
BECAUSE YOU WON'T GO TO BED.

01:46.774 --> 01:48.909
NOW, SCOOT.
- THANKS FOR BLOWING MY COVER.

01:48.942 --> 01:51.245
NOW I'M GONNA

01:51.279 --> 01:53.547

01:55.749 --> 01:57.718
- UH, WHEN HIS MOTHER
ABANDONED HIM.

01:57.751 --> 02:01.155
TRYING TO TRACK DOWN
THE FATHER.

02:01.189 --> 02:04.158
SO...WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE?

02:04.192 --> 02:06.660
- I NEED A WEENSIE FAVOR.

02:06.694 --> 02:10.331
I CAN'T TAKE THIS
TO THE FBI LAB.

02:12.333 --> 02:15.869
SO CAN YOU RUN THAT RAPE KIT
FOR ME AS A JANE DOE?

02:15.903 --> 02:18.806
- WHO'S THE VICTIM?

02:18.839 --> 02:20.908
- ME.

02:25.813 --> 02:28.749
[Law & Order theme]

02:28.782 --> 02:36.724
*

03:14.662 --> 03:16.597
- WHAT'S WITH
THE CLOAK AND DAGGER?

03:16.630 --> 03:19.500
- I PROMISED I'D BE DISCREET.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.402
UH...I DROPPED OFF
A JANE DOE RAPE KIT

03:21.435 --> 03:22.936
AT WARNER'S OFFICE
THIS MORNING.

03:22.970 --> 03:25.473
- VIP?
- FBI.

03:25.506 --> 03:27.341
- DANA LEWIS.

03:27.375 --> 03:29.477
- SHE ALL RIGHT?
- SHE CLAIMS TO BE.

03:29.510 --> 03:32.713
- SHE REFUSES TO REPORT IT
TO HER BOSSES AT THE BUREAU.

03:32.746 --> 03:34.515
- SHE'S BEEN UNDERCOVER
FOR A YEAR.

03:34.548 --> 03:35.816
SHE'S CLOSE TO MAKING A BUST.

03:35.849 --> 03:37.651
IF SHE TELLS THE FEDS NOW,
THEY'LL PULL HER OUT.

03:37.685 --> 03:38.986
- AND...THEY SHOULD.

03:39.019 --> 03:40.721
SHE DOESN'T KNOW
WHO ATTACKED HER.

03:40.754 --> 03:42.523
IF IT'S THE TARGET,
HER COVER'S ALREADY BLOWN.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.625
- SHE'S ONLY ASKING FOR A FEW
MORE DAYS TO CLOSE THE CASE.

03:44.658 --> 03:46.460
- WHICH IS?

03:46.494 --> 03:47.695
- SHE CAN'T TELL ME.

03:47.728 --> 03:50.398
- SO HOW DO WE INVESTIGATE?
WE CAN'T EVEN GET A HOLD OF HER.

03:50.431 --> 03:51.832
- LOOK, SHE'S A RELUCTANT
COMPLAINANT,

03:51.865 --> 03:53.934
BUT SHE PROMISED
SHE'D CONTACT ME TODAY.

03:56.804 --> 03:59.540
- I'LL HOLD OFF
CALLING HER SAC FOR A WHILE.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.809
BUT GIVE ME
THE FULL PICTURE.

04:03.544 --> 04:05.546
- THE LABYRINTH
BECOMES A MIRROR

04:05.579 --> 04:07.581
FOR WHERE WE ARE
IN OUR LIFE.

04:07.615 --> 04:09.683
IT HAS ONLY ONE PATH.

04:09.717 --> 04:12.686
THERE ARE NO TRICKS
AND NO DEAD ENDS.

04:12.720 --> 04:14.755
- I'M SORRY
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU.

04:14.788 --> 04:16.690
- ME TOO.

04:16.724 --> 04:18.792
I'M ALSO SORRY
YOU BROUGHT HIM.

04:18.826 --> 04:21.595
- DANA, HE'S MY PARTNER.

04:21.629 --> 04:24.398
I HAD TO TELL HIM.
- NO, YOU DIDN'T.

04:24.432 --> 04:27.000
I KNOW YOU'RE JUST HERE
TO SEE IF I'M OKAY.

04:27.034 --> 04:29.537
I'M FINE.
I'M WORKING.

04:29.570 --> 04:31.939
- DOWN BY GROUND ZERO.
SO IT'S AN ANTI-TERROR CASE?

04:31.972 --> 04:33.441
- ASK ME A QUESTION
I CAN ANSWER.

04:33.474 --> 04:35.576
- COME ON.
YOU GOTTA FILL IN THE BLANKS.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.010
- I'M WORKING THREE CASES
RIGHT NOW.

04:37.044 --> 04:38.612
IF MY COVER WAS BLOWN
ON ONE OF THEM,

04:38.646 --> 04:40.914
I NEED TO KNOW
WHICH ONE IT IS.

04:40.948 --> 04:42.883
I NEVER ASKED YOU
TO INVESTIGATE.

04:42.916 --> 04:45.018
I JUST ASKED FOR A LAB REPORT.

04:45.052 --> 04:46.620
- AND THE SECOND WE GET IT,
IT'S ALL YOURS.

04:46.654 --> 04:48.422
BUT IN THE MEANTIME,

04:48.456 --> 04:50.591
WHY DON'T YOU JUST WALK US
THROUGH YOUR CRIME SCENE?

04:50.624 --> 04:52.860
- IT'S NOT NECESSARY.
YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING THERE IS.

04:52.893 --> 04:54.562
- FRESH PAIR OF EYES
CAN'T HURT.

04:54.595 --> 04:56.630
- AND IF IT'S NOT
RELATED TO THE JOB...

04:56.664 --> 04:58.899
IF YOU WERE A RANDOM VICTIM,
HE RAPES SOMEBODY ELSE,

04:58.932 --> 05:00.568
THEN HOW ARE YOU
GONNA FEEL?

05:00.601 --> 05:01.669
- OH, REALLY?

05:01.702 --> 05:05.005
YOU'RE PLAYING THE GUILT CARD
ON A FRAGILE VICTIM?

05:05.038 --> 05:07.475
- REALLY?
FRAGILE?

05:07.508 --> 05:08.809
I MEAN,
EVERY TIME I'M NEAR YOU,

05:08.842 --> 05:10.611
I WIND UP IN THE HOSPITAL.

05:10.644 --> 05:13.481
WHEN YOU'RE CHASING DOWN
THOSE ARYANS, I GET SHOT.

05:13.514 --> 05:15.449
WHEN YOU'RE AFTER THOSE
ECO-FREAKS, I GET BLOWN UP.

05:15.483 --> 05:18.586
- STOP.
YOU HAD ME AT SHOT.

05:18.619 --> 05:20.921
WE CAN'T BE SEEN
GOING THERE TOGETHER.

05:20.954 --> 05:25.559
I'LL GIVE YOU THE ADDRESS.
YOU MEET ME THERE.

05:25.593 --> 05:28.095
- SHE DIDN'T TELL ME SHE WAS
RAPED IN HER CRASH PAD.

05:28.128 --> 05:29.630
- WELL, THEY GOTTA PULL HER
OUT OF HERE.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.665
HER COVER'S
DEFINITELY BEEN BLOWN.

05:31.699 --> 05:34.668
- WELL, THEY CERTAINLY PUMPED
A LOT OF MONEY INTO THIS ONE.

05:34.702 --> 05:36.604
HER FAKE KIDS
EVEN LOOK LIKE HER.

05:36.637 --> 05:38.839
- THAT'S BECAUSE
THEY ARE MINE.

05:38.872 --> 05:41.475
AND SO IS THE APARTMENT.

05:41.509 --> 05:43.977
- WHERE WERE THE KIDS
WHEN YOU WERE ATTACKED?

05:44.011 --> 05:45.979
- THEY LIVE IN D.C.
WITH THEIR DADDY.

05:46.013 --> 05:48.482
I'M SHIPPING 'EM OFF TO EUROPE
TILL I CAN CLEAN THIS MESS UP.

05:48.516 --> 05:50.418
- YOU'VE A VERY
UNDERSTANDING EX.

05:50.451 --> 05:53.554
- YES, BUT WE'RE NOT DIVORCED.
MARRIED 20 YEARS NEXT MONTH.

05:53.587 --> 05:54.922
- REALLY?
- MM-HMM.

05:54.955 --> 05:57.024
ALEC IS A ROCK.
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD SURPRISE HIM

05:57.057 --> 05:59.460
AND JOIN HIM
AND THE KIDS IN EUROPE.

05:59.493 --> 06:00.561
- BUT DON'T YOU WANT ME
TO ANSWER

06:00.594 --> 06:02.129
ALL YOUR LITTLE QUESTIONS?

06:02.162 --> 06:04.465
STARTING WITH
THE ROMANTIC DETAILS?

06:04.498 --> 06:05.699
RIGHT THIS WAY.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.135
I HAD JUST COME HOME

06:08.168 --> 06:11.572
AFTER CRAWLIN' AROUND
IN THE DIRT ALL DAY.

06:11.605 --> 06:12.973
HE YOKED ME
AS I WALKED THROUGH THIS DOOR.

06:13.006 --> 06:14.875
HE WAS 6'2", MAYBE 220.

06:14.908 --> 06:18.011
- GET A LOOK AT HIS FACE?
- HE WAS WEARIN' A MASK.

06:18.045 --> 06:21.549
I ELBOWED HIM IN THE RIBS,
BUT HE HAD ME IN A SLEEPER HOLD.

06:21.582 --> 06:23.551
- AND YOU WERE OUT
IN FOUR SECONDS.

06:23.584 --> 06:26.086
- YEP. AND, UH...

06:26.119 --> 06:29.490
WHEN I CAME TO,
I WAS LYIN' ON THE BED...

06:31.459 --> 06:34.194
AND HE WAS ON TOP OF ME
AND, UH...

06:34.227 --> 06:36.063
RAPIN' ME.

06:36.096 --> 06:39.132
VAGINAL PENETRATION ONLY.
[laughs]

06:39.166 --> 06:41.469
I AM TRAINED...

06:41.502 --> 06:43.003
TO GET OUT
OF THAT SITUATION.

06:43.036 --> 06:45.005
- YOU CAN'T PREPARE
FOR EVERY SITUATION.

06:45.038 --> 06:47.074
TRUST ME. I KNOW.
- I COULDN'T MOVE.

06:47.107 --> 06:49.510

06:49.543 --> 06:50.811
- I DON'T, PINHEAD.
[laughs]

06:50.844 --> 06:53.714
HE HAD INJECTED ME
WITH A PARALYTIC AGENT.

06:53.747 --> 06:56.550
I COULDN'T...SCREAM.

06:56.584 --> 06:58.486
BUT I COULD FEEL EVERYTHING.

06:58.519 --> 07:01.522
- HOW LONG DID IT LAST?

07:01.555 --> 07:04.992
- SEVEN MINUTES OF HEAVEN.

07:05.025 --> 07:07.561
CLOSER TO 30.

07:09.029 --> 07:13.200
HE LEFT PRETTY QUICK
AFTER HE FINISHED AND, UH,

07:13.233 --> 07:15.703
THE DRUG WORE OFF
PRETTY FAST AFTER THAT.

07:15.736 --> 07:17.771
I DID MY OWN RAPE KIT

07:17.805 --> 07:19.773
AND GOT TO YOUR HOUSE
AROUND MIDNIGHT.

07:19.807 --> 07:21.208

OF THE EVIDENCE THERE IS,

07:25.646 --> 07:29.517
SO, UM...

INTO A TRAP,

07:38.091 --> 07:39.827

09:54.161 --> 09:56.329
- ONE OF THEIR NUTS
ALLEGEDLY ACTING ON HIS OWN

09:56.363 --> 09:58.632
TOOK OUT AN IRS AGENT.

09:58.666 --> 09:59.532
- CALL ELLIOT BACK.

09:59.566 --> 10:02.636
LET 'EM KNOW
WHO THEY'RE DEALING WITH.

10:02.670 --> 10:05.639
- WE NEVER SHOULD HAVE LET HER
BACK IN THE FIELD.

10:05.673 --> 10:07.407
- YOU THE GUYS WHO PUT OUT
THE BOLO FOR THE OHIO PLATE?

10:07.440 --> 10:09.409
- YEAH. WHAT HAPPENED?
- I SAW THEM HEADING NORTHBOUND

10:09.442 --> 10:10.543
JUST PAST THE PEEKSKILL
HOLLOW EXIT.

10:10.577 --> 10:12.680
I CALLED IT IN AND KEPT PACE.
- THE INSTRUCTIONS WERE

10:12.713 --> 10:15.382
TO NOTIFY ONLY, NOT FOLLOW.
- MY CALL.

10:15.415 --> 10:17.417
- HOW MANY BODIES?
- JUST ONE.

10:17.450 --> 10:20.053
IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT.
- LOOKS MALE.

10:20.087 --> 10:21.689
IT MUST BE DAVID WORTHY.

10:21.722 --> 10:23.824
- WAS THIS THE DRIVER?

10:23.857 --> 10:26.694
- YES.
- YOU SAW THE EXPLOSION?

10:26.727 --> 10:27.961
- IN MY REARVIEW MIRROR.

10:27.995 --> 10:30.163
- I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU WERE FOLLOWING.

10:30.197 --> 10:32.399
- I WAS HANGING BACK ABOUT
100 YARDS TILL THEY LOST ME.

10:32.432 --> 10:34.702
THEY MUST HAVE PULLED IN HERE,
AND I DROVE RIGHT BY 'EM.

10:34.735 --> 10:36.303
I WENT ANOTHER MILE...
KABOOM.

10:36.336 --> 10:37.938
- WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU KEEP SAYING "THEY."

10:37.971 --> 10:39.339
HOW MANY PEOPLE
WERE IN THE VAN?

10:39.372 --> 10:41.675
- I COUNTED SIX OCCUPANTS--
FIVE MALE, ONE FEMALE.

10:41.709 --> 10:45.045
BY THE TIME I GOT BACK HERE,
THERE WAS NO SIGN OF THEM.

10:45.078 --> 10:47.681
- AND NOTHING AROUND HERE
FOR MILES.

10:47.715 --> 10:49.382
- SO WHERE THE HELL
DID THEY TAKE DANA?

10:51.752 --> 10:53.954
- YOU'VE GOTTA PULL
AGENT LEWIS OUT.

10:53.987 --> 10:57.424
- OF...WHAT?
- WE DON'T KNOW THE PARTICULARS,

10:57.457 --> 10:59.326
BUT WE KNOW IT INVOLVES
THE SOVEREIGN CITIZENS BRIGADE.

10:59.359 --> 11:00.728
- YOU HEARD ABOUT THE VAN
THAT BLEW UP

11:00.761 --> 11:04.364
ON THE TACONIC LAST NIGHT?
- SHOULD I HAVE?

11:04.397 --> 11:06.934
- WELL, THE CRISPY CRITTER
INSIDE WAS MORE THAN LIKELY

11:06.967 --> 11:09.402
A GUY NAMED DAVID WORTHY.

11:09.436 --> 11:11.238
NOW, WE OBSERVED AGENT LEWIS
GETTING INTO HIS VAN

11:11.271 --> 11:13.206
EARLIER IN THE DAY.

11:13.240 --> 11:14.374
- IT DID NOT APPEAR
TO BE VOLUNTARY.

11:14.407 --> 11:15.475
THERE WERE FIVE OTHER
SUBJECTS ON BOARD.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.344
- WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE
HER COVER'S BEEN BLOWN

11:17.377 --> 11:18.979
AND SHE'S IN SERIOUS DANGER.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.380
WORTHY, BEFORE HE BECAME
BARBECUE,

11:20.413 --> 11:23.250
HAD A BULLET
PUMPED INTO HIS HEAD.

11:23.283 --> 11:24.752
- WE CAN'T REACH DANA.

11:24.785 --> 11:26.920
SHE HASN'T RETURNED
TO HER APARTMENT.

11:26.954 --> 11:29.790
- HAS SHE MADE CONTACT?
- NOT IN ABOUT 12 MONTHS.

11:32.525 --> 11:35.262
- SHE'S THAT DEEP UNDER?

11:35.295 --> 11:38.365
- DANA...LEFT THE BUREAU

11:38.398 --> 11:40.433
ABOUT A YEAR AGO.

11:51.178 --> 11:52.279
- WHO THE HELL IS DANA
WORKING FOR?

11:52.312 --> 11:53.346
- SHE'S A PAIN IN THE ASS,

11:53.380 --> 11:55.816
BUT ONE OF THE ALPHABETS
WOULD HAVE SCOOPED HER UP.

11:55.849 --> 11:58.485
- NSA, ATF, DOD--GOT OVER
A THOUSAND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES

11:58.518 --> 11:59.586
WORKING COUNTERTERR.

11:59.619 --> 12:02.122
- AND THAT'S NOT EVEN COUNTING
THE PRIVATE SECTOR.

12:02.155 --> 12:05.058
- ALL RIGHT...

12:05.092 --> 12:07.961
SHE'S STONEWALLED US
ON EVERY DETAIL.

12:07.995 --> 12:09.763
SHE SPENT THE DAY PLAYING US.

12:09.797 --> 12:12.165
THE ANTI-MOSQUE CROWD--
THAT WAS A SMOKESCREEN.

12:12.199 --> 12:13.867
- BUT SHE DID MEET
A REAL TARGET THERE.

12:13.901 --> 12:14.868
- SO THAT'S IT.

12:14.902 --> 12:17.037
THE CITIZEN'S BRIGADE--
WE GOTTA TRACK THEM DOWN

12:17.070 --> 12:19.039
BEFORE THEY WIND UP PUTTING
A BULLET IN HER HEAD.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.241
- THEY'RE PARANOID
CONSPIRACY THEORISTS, RIGHT?

12:21.274 --> 12:24.978
- MM-HMM.
- TIME TO CALL IN THE EXPERT?

12:26.279 --> 12:28.115
- "THE SEMINAR
YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO MISS.

12:28.148 --> 12:29.416
"TODAY ONLY, TOM MARSHALL

12:29.449 --> 12:32.519
OF THE SOVEREIGN
CITIZEN'S BRIGADE."

12:32.552 --> 12:34.087
"HOW TO AVOID FORECLOSURE.

12:34.121 --> 12:35.989
WHAT THE GOVERNMENT
DOESN'T WANT YOU TO KNOW."

12:36.023 --> 12:37.224
- DON'T DRINK THE KOOL-AID,
MUNCH.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.992
WE CAME HERE
TO SWEAT THIS GUY,

12:39.026 --> 12:41.228
NOT SIGN UP FOR
HIS MASTER CLASS.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.130
- A SECRET IDENTITY
WAS CREATED

12:43.163 --> 12:45.232
FOR EACH AND EVERY
ONE OF YOU AT BIRTH.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.300
IT'S CALLED A STRAW MAN.

12:47.334 --> 12:49.402
IT'S LINKED TO AN ACCOUNT
AT THE U.S. TREASURY

12:49.436 --> 12:52.305
WHICH THEY USE AS COLLATERAL
ON FOREIGN DEBT.

12:52.339 --> 12:54.274
- IF YOU FILE
THE RIGHT DOCUMENTS

12:54.307 --> 12:57.210
AT THE RIGHT OFFICES,
THAT MONEY CAN BE YOURS.

12:57.244 --> 12:58.311
- RIGHT.

12:58.345 --> 13:00.280
- EACH OF US CAN REGAIN
OUR SOVEREIGNTY,

13:00.313 --> 13:02.582
ACTIVELY OPT OUT OF
GOVERNMENT ENSLAVEMENT.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.417
- HOW DO I BREAK
THESE SHACKLES?

13:04.451 --> 13:06.286
- I'VE COMPILED
ALL THE FORMS YOU NEED.

13:06.319 --> 13:08.856
BILL OF EXCHANGE,
PROMISSORY BOND...

13:08.889 --> 13:11.391
[laughs] THERE'S MORE THAN
ENOUGH TO GO AROUND, GENTLEMEN.

13:11.424 --> 13:14.327
THEY'LL BE AVAILABLE FOR
PURCHASE AFTER THE LECTURE.

13:14.361 --> 13:16.529
YOU TAP INTO
THE STRAW MAN ACCOUNT, YOU--

13:16.563 --> 13:17.664
- IT'S CALLED A REDEMPTION SCAM,
FOLKS.

13:17.697 --> 13:20.968
- SADLY, IT'S BEEN REPEATEDLY
REJECTED BY THE COURTS.

13:21.001 --> 13:22.602
DON'T GIVE THIS CHARLATAN
ANOTHER DIME.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.137
- SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE?

13:24.171 --> 13:26.206
THE GOVERNMENT
HAS SENT ITS LACKEYS

13:26.239 --> 13:27.140
TO OBFUSCATE THE TRUTH.

13:27.174 --> 13:28.909
- YOU WANT TRUTH?
YOU'VE BEEN PREYED UPON

13:28.942 --> 13:31.945
BY WALL STREET, BANKS,
AND MORTGAGE COMPANIES.

13:31.979 --> 13:34.181
DON'T LET THIS SCHMENDRICK
CON YOU TOO.

13:34.214 --> 13:35.883
- YOU'RE UNDER ARREST
FOR FRAUD.

13:35.916 --> 13:39.252
- YOU'RE TOOLS
OF AN ILLEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT.

13:39.286 --> 13:42.022
I DON'T RECOGNIZE
YOUR AUTHORITY.

13:42.055 --> 13:44.391
OR YOUR LAWS.

13:44.424 --> 13:47.194
- DAVID WORTHY.

13:47.227 --> 13:49.496
HE'S PART OF YOUR PACK.
- HE'S WITH THE OHIO CHAPTER.

13:49.529 --> 13:51.264
- YEAH.

13:51.298 --> 13:54.001
- I USED TO READ HIS BLOG.

13:54.034 --> 13:55.235
I NEVER MET HIM.

13:55.268 --> 13:57.004
- YOU'RE NOT GOING TO,
EITHER.

13:57.037 --> 14:00.140
YOUR S.C.B. BOYS HAVE STARTED
GETTING A LITTLE PARANOID

14:00.173 --> 14:02.375
AND KILLING EACH OTHER OFF,
AND THAT'S FINE BY ME,

14:02.409 --> 14:04.277
BUT THEY'VE KIDNAPPED
A FEDERAL AGENT.

14:04.311 --> 14:05.979
- I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THAT--

14:06.013 --> 14:07.981
- THE FEDS KNOW YOU DO.

14:08.015 --> 14:10.350
THEY KNOW YOU DO.

14:12.285 --> 14:15.155
NOW, UNLESS YOU WANT TO SPEND
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE

14:15.188 --> 14:17.424
IN A FEMA DEATH CAMP...

14:17.457 --> 14:19.927
YOU BETTER
START TALKIN' TO ME.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.297
DON'T LOOK AT THE MIRROR.

14:29.102 --> 14:31.304
- ALL I KNOW...

14:31.338 --> 14:35.475
IS THAT DAVID STARTED
TO SOUND CRAZY ON HIS BLOG.

14:35.508 --> 14:38.411
HE SAID THE TIME
FOR NONVIOLENCE IS OVER.

14:38.445 --> 14:40.280
- [whispers]
WHERE'S HIS COMPOUND?

14:40.313 --> 14:43.683
- I DON'T KNOW.

14:43.716 --> 14:46.519
S.C.B. BELIEVES IN
A PEACEFUL SOLUTION

14:46.553 --> 14:49.156
TO WORLD ENSLAVEMENT.

14:49.189 --> 14:53.226
WHEN WE REFUSED
TO RESORT TO VIOLENCE...

14:53.260 --> 14:56.196
DAVID FOUND
A GROUP THAT WOULD.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.065
- WHO?

14:58.098 --> 14:59.466
- "PATRIOTS AGAINST TYRANNY"?

14:59.499 --> 15:01.334
- MILITIA GROUP BASED
RIGHT HERE IN NEW YORK.

15:01.368 --> 15:03.603
- YEAH, WHO MR. WORTHY FOUND
MORE IN SYNC WITH HIS IDEOLOGY.

15:03.636 --> 15:05.205
- IN THE PAST TWO YEARS,

15:05.238 --> 15:08.008
THERE'S BEEN A 300% INCREASE
IN ACTIVE MILITIAS.

15:08.041 --> 15:10.243
- AS THEY SEE IT, SOMEONE'S OUT
TO TAKE THEIR GUNS AWAY.

15:10.277 --> 15:11.411
- THAT'S WHY
THEY'RE STOCKPILING 'EM,

15:11.444 --> 15:13.046
GOING OUT AND TRAINING
IN THE WOODS.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.347
- FOR WHAT, A REVOLUTION?
[cell phone rings]

15:14.381 --> 15:16.449
- FIN.
- THE USUAL--PAT'S MISSION

15:16.483 --> 15:18.651
IS TO END THE CURRENT SYSTEM OF
GOVERNMENT, ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.

15:18.685 --> 15:21.188
- MY CONTACT'S
GOT A BEAD ON THE PATS.

15:21.221 --> 15:23.957
THEIR COMPOUND'S
IN STATEN ISLAND.

15:28.028 --> 15:32.065
- WHAT THE HELL?
HEY, WHO'S IN THAT BUS?

15:32.099 --> 15:33.500
- NO IDEA.
THERE'S BODIES EVERYWHERE.

15:33.533 --> 15:35.302
FEDS REALLY SCREWED THE POOCH
ON THIS ONE.

15:35.335 --> 15:38.305
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- WACO MEETS RUBY RIDGE.

15:38.338 --> 15:41.008
- THERE'S THE SON OF A BITCH
RIGHT THERE.

15:41.041 --> 15:43.010
HEY, DOWLING.

15:43.043 --> 15:44.611
- CANNOT BELIEVE THAT YOU
LOOKED US IN THE EYES

15:44.644 --> 15:46.146
AND YOU LIED.

15:46.179 --> 15:47.580
- YOU NEVER GAVE ME THE CODE.

15:47.614 --> 15:50.417
IF DANA HAD WANTED ME
TO SHARE INFORMATION WITH YOU,

15:50.450 --> 15:52.052
YOU'D KNOW IT ALREADY.

15:52.085 --> 15:53.420
YOU'RE INTERFERING WITH
A FEDERAL INVESTIGATION.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.255
- EL, THERE'S THE OTHER GUY
FROM THE RALLY,

15:55.288 --> 15:56.990
THE ONE THAT
SHOVED HER IN THE CAR.

15:57.024 --> 15:58.458
- WHERE'S DANA?
- WHEN YOU CAME IN SCREAMING

15:58.491 --> 16:00.727
THE SKY WAS FALLING,
WE HAD TO TRY TO GET HER OUT.

16:00.760 --> 16:03.530
BUT THEIR SURVEILLANCE
BLEW OUR COVER.

16:03.563 --> 16:06.166
SHE WAS EMBEDDED
WHEN THE RAID WENT DOWN.

16:06.199 --> 16:07.700
SHE'S IN THE HOUSE.

16:25.718 --> 16:27.087
- OH, MY GOD.

16:27.120 --> 16:30.490
THERE WERE NO SURVIVORS.

16:30.523 --> 16:34.394
- WHO LET THESE JOKERS
IN HERE?

16:35.495 --> 16:37.130
- YOU'RE OKAY.

16:37.164 --> 16:39.199
- YEAH. NO THANKS TO YOU.

16:39.232 --> 16:40.767
HEY, WHAT PART OF ME
DITCHING YOU AT THE RALLY

16:40.800 --> 16:42.402
DID YOU NOT GET?

16:42.435 --> 16:44.471
I MET UP WITH A CONTACT

16:44.504 --> 16:46.706
THAT I WAS WORKING
FOR SIX MONTHS.

16:46.739 --> 16:49.142
EVERYTHING WAS UNDER CONTROL.

16:49.176 --> 16:52.045
- CONTROL INCLUDE THAT VAN
YOU WERE IN GETTING BLOWN UP?

16:52.079 --> 16:53.680
- THAT WAS AN UNSCHEDULED
BOOM BOOM

16:53.713 --> 16:54.681
WHICH WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED

16:54.714 --> 16:57.617
HAD YOU BOZOS NOT SICCED
THE STATE TROOPER ON US.

16:57.650 --> 16:59.252
- SHE WASN'T SUPPOSED
TO FOLLOW YOU.

16:59.286 --> 17:00.453
- WELL, SHE DID!

17:00.487 --> 17:03.556
THE PAT'S PLAN
WAS TO SPARK A REVOLUTION

17:03.590 --> 17:05.692
BY KILLING A COP,
AND YOU GUYS

17:05.725 --> 17:07.660
SERVED UP THAT STATE TROOPER
ON A SILVER PLATTER.

17:07.694 --> 17:10.163
THEN, AFTER ALL OF
NEW YORK'S FINEST

17:10.197 --> 17:11.331
WOULD ATTEND THE FUNERAL,

17:11.364 --> 17:12.699
THEY WOULD JUST BLOW
EVERYBODY ELSE UP.

17:12.732 --> 17:14.534
- HEY, HEY--

17:14.567 --> 17:17.704
I DON'T HAVE A GOOD TRACK
RECORD WITH YOU AND EXPLOSIVES.

17:17.737 --> 17:20.840
- OH, RELAX, NANCY.
PIN'S IN IT.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.542
- HOW DID YOU STOP THEM?

17:22.575 --> 17:25.245
- BY REMINDING THEM...

17:25.278 --> 17:27.380
THAT ALL OF THE PATs
WERE SUPPOSED TO BE THERE

17:27.414 --> 17:29.282
WHEN THE SPARK WAS IGNITED.

17:29.316 --> 17:30.617
WE WERE A FEW MEMBERS SHORT.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.685
- WELL, DID YOU GET 'EM ALL?
- WOULD HAVE...

17:32.719 --> 17:36.789
HAD THE RAID GONE DOWN
WHEN IT SHOULDA.

17:36.823 --> 17:39.592
ALL THE BIG BOYS
WERE COMIN' IN FROM OUT WEST

17:39.626 --> 17:41.461
TOMORROW.

17:41.494 --> 17:43.296
- WHY DID THEY KILL WORTHY?

17:43.330 --> 17:45.298
- WHEN WE PULLED OFF
INTO THE TREES,

17:45.332 --> 17:50.570
HE ACCIDENTALLY
HIT HIS BRIGHTS AND...

17:50.603 --> 17:54.374
THEY THOUGHT THAT HE WAS
SIGNALING TO THE STATE TROOPER.

17:54.407 --> 17:56.543
[scoffs]
THEY'RE A PARANOID BUNCH.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.611
- SO WHERE'D YOU GO?

17:58.645 --> 18:00.280
THERE'S NOTHING FOR MILES
AROUND THERE.

18:00.313 --> 18:02.215
- WE DIDN'T PULL OFF
THE PARKWAY

18:02.249 --> 18:04.217
UNTIL WE HAD THE CAR IN PLACE.

18:04.251 --> 18:07.354
[weapons clatter]

18:07.387 --> 18:09.256
IT BROUGHT US STRAIGHT HERE.

18:09.289 --> 18:11.858
SORRY I DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE
TO CHECK IN

18:11.891 --> 18:14.194
WITH MOMMY AND DADDY.

18:14.227 --> 18:17.464
I KILLED THREE PEOPLE TODAY
THAT I MEANT TO TAKE IN ALIVE.

18:21.901 --> 18:23.670
DO YOU HAVE MY LAB REPORT?

18:23.703 --> 18:26.373
- WE'VE BEEN KINDA BUSY.

18:26.406 --> 18:28.608
- WELL, WOULD YOU PLEASE
REDIRECT ALL MY EVIDENCE

18:28.641 --> 18:30.443
TO THE FBI LAB?

18:30.477 --> 18:32.145
THEY'LL BE HANDLING IT
FROM HERE.

18:32.179 --> 18:33.280
WE'RE DONE.

18:37.217 --> 18:38.718
- WE'RE NOT HANDING THIS CASE
OVER TO THE FEDS.

18:38.751 --> 18:40.720
- LET IT GO, LIV.
- IT'S OUR JURISDICTION.

18:40.753 --> 18:42.822
- DANA IS NEVER GONNA
COOPERATE WITH US.

18:42.855 --> 18:44.857
LET THEM DEAL WITH HER.
MAYBE THEY'LL HAVE BETTER LUCK.

18:44.891 --> 18:47.360
- NO, I SAY WE GIVE HER
A DAY OR TWO TO CALM DOWN,

18:47.394 --> 18:48.628
AND THEN WE GO BACK AT HER.
- OKAY.

18:48.661 --> 18:50.797
- GUYS, YOU GOTTA GET DANA
DOWN HERE ASAP.

18:50.830 --> 18:51.898
- [laughs]

18:51.931 --> 18:53.433
OKAY, THAT'S NOT
GONNA HAPPEN.

18:53.466 --> 18:55.402
- WELL, SUCK IT UP
AND SAY PRETTY PLEASE.

18:55.435 --> 18:57.870
WE JUST CAUGHT A CASE WHERE
THE VICTIM WAS CHOKED OUT.

18:57.904 --> 19:00.207
- AND INJECTED WITH
A PARALYZING AGENT, THEN RAPED.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.874
SOUND FAMILIAR?

19:01.908 --> 19:03.710
- THE SAME M.O. AS DANA.
HE HIT AGAIN.

19:03.743 --> 19:07.247
- NEW VICTIM'S NAME IS
JENNIFER BRIGGS, 27.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.916
- SHE WAS ATTACKED IN HER SOHO
APARTMENT EARLY THIS MORNING.

19:09.949 --> 19:12.319
- WELL, THEY'RE CONNECTED.
IS SHE FBI?

19:12.352 --> 19:14.387
- MUCH MORE DANGEROUS.
AN ACCOUNTANT.

19:14.421 --> 19:16.223
- WHERE IS SHE?
WE NEED TO TALK TO HER.

19:16.256 --> 19:18.825
- UNFORTUNATELY, THIS IS
WHERE THE PATTERN BREAKS.

19:18.858 --> 19:22.929
HE LET DANA LIVE,
BUT JENNIFER WASN'T SO LUCKY.

19:31.271 --> 19:32.205
- LOOK, WE REALLY
APPRECIATE THIS.

19:32.239 --> 19:34.541
OUR CALLS WERE GOING
STRAIGHT TO VOICEMAIL.

19:34.574 --> 19:36.776
- LAST THING I OWE YOU TWO
IS A FAVOR.

19:36.809 --> 19:38.945
TELL CRAGEN WE'RE SQUARE.

19:38.978 --> 19:41.714
- FLUNKED HIGH SCHOOL
TYPING, HUH?

19:41.748 --> 19:44.617
- USUALLY, MY HANDLER
TYPES UP MY REPORTS.

19:44.651 --> 19:45.985
BUT SINCE I'VE BEEN BENCHED...

19:46.018 --> 19:47.754
- DON'T KEEP HER TOO LONG.

19:47.787 --> 19:50.390
YOU GUYS CREATED A MOUNTAIN
OF PAPERWORK FOR HER.

19:50.423 --> 19:53.593
I'LL LEAVE YOU LADIES
TO CHAT.

19:53.626 --> 19:55.528
- LOOK, DANA,
WE'RE NOT HERE ABOUT YOU.

19:55.562 --> 19:56.663
WE'VE ALREADY APOLOGIZED.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.298
- WE'RE HERE ABOUT
JENNIFER BRIGGS,

19:58.331 --> 20:00.600
YOUR RAPIST'S NEWEST VICTIM.

20:00.633 --> 20:03.370
- WHO WASN'T AS LUCKY AS YOU.

20:03.403 --> 20:04.971
SHE'S DEAD.

20:05.004 --> 20:08.308
- WELL, MAYBE IF Y'ALL HAD
CONCENTRATED ON MY LAB REPORT

20:08.341 --> 20:10.877
INSTEAD OF GETTING KNEE-DEEP
IN MY BUSINESS,

20:10.910 --> 20:11.978
SHE'D BE ALIVE.
- WAIT A MINUTE.

20:12.011 --> 20:14.547
HOW 'BOUT IF YOU HAD
COOPERATED FROM THE BEGINNING?

20:14.581 --> 20:16.616
YOU DO YOUR OWN RAPE KIT?
YOU PROCESS THE CRIME SCENE?

20:16.649 --> 20:19.419
I MEAN, WHO KNOWS WHAT EVIDENCE
YOU SCREWED UP?

20:21.854 --> 20:23.456
HERE'S YOUR LAB REPORT.

20:23.490 --> 20:25.525
[paper rustles]

20:26.926 --> 20:28.928
SHOOT.
NO DNA.

20:28.961 --> 20:31.664
- THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GONNA BREAK
THIS IS TO WORK THE PATTERN.

20:31.698 --> 20:33.666
CAN'T DO THAT WITHOUT YOU.

20:33.700 --> 20:35.935
- OKAY.

20:35.968 --> 20:38.438
BUT I CAN'T
TALK ABOUT IT HERE.

20:42.675 --> 20:45.878
- YOU RECOGNIZE HER?

20:45.912 --> 20:47.447
- NO.
- IF YOUR ATTACK WAS RELATED

20:47.480 --> 20:49.882
TO ONE OF YOUR CASES,
YOU TWO HAVE TO BE LINKED.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.551
- COULD SHE BE SOMEBODY'S
GIRLFRIEND

20:51.584 --> 20:52.952
IN THE PATRIOTS
AGAINST TYRANNY?

20:52.985 --> 20:54.521
- I'VE NEVER
HEARD HER MENTIONED.

20:54.554 --> 20:57.290
- YOU SPENT THE ENTIRE DAY
WITH THEM.

20:57.324 --> 20:58.725
AFTER YOU WERE ATTACKED,

20:58.758 --> 21:01.728
DID ANYONE JUMP OUT AT YOU
AS A POSSIBLE SUSPECT?

21:01.761 --> 21:03.730
- WELL, THERE WAS ONE GUY

21:03.763 --> 21:05.932
WHO WAS EYEING ME
A LITTLE BIT FUNNY, BUT...

21:05.965 --> 21:09.001
HE WAS IN A BODY BAG BEFORE
THIS LITTLE GIRL WAS MURDERED.

21:09.035 --> 21:10.937
- HOW ABOUT ONE OF YOUR
OTHER CASES?

21:13.573 --> 21:15.908
- TELL ME ABOUT HER.

21:15.942 --> 21:17.744
- SHE LIVED IN SOHO.

21:17.777 --> 21:19.746
SHE WORKED
IN THE DIAMOND DISTRICT.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.748
- REALLY.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.583
BUREAU WAS COOPERATING
WITH INTERPOL

21:23.616 --> 21:25.718
ON A SERIES
OF INTERNATIONAL HEISTS.

21:25.752 --> 21:27.053
APPARENTLY,
SOME OF THE DIAMONDS

21:27.086 --> 21:28.421
HAVE FOUND THEIR WAY
OVER HERE

21:28.455 --> 21:29.622
INTO THE STONECUTTER'S
INSTITUTE.

21:29.656 --> 21:32.792
- OKAY. JENNIFER WORKED AT
KAUFFMAN FEIN AS AN ACCOUNTANT.

21:32.825 --> 21:35.061
- MAYBE SHE GOT HER HAND
CAUGHT IN A DIAMOND JAR.

21:35.094 --> 21:36.929
- IT'S FUNNY
YOU SHOULD SAY THAT,

21:36.963 --> 21:39.499
BECAUSE HE BROKE
EVERY ONE OF HERS.

21:40.933 --> 21:43.470
ONE AT A TIME.

21:43.503 --> 21:47.507
- WELL, THAT MUST HAVE BEEN
INCREDIBLY PAINFUL.

21:47.540 --> 21:51.110
COURSE...SHE COULDN'T
DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

21:51.143 --> 21:54.781
BUT HE EXHIBITED MORE ANGER
AT HER THAN AT ME.

21:54.814 --> 21:59.051
- IT MEANS THAT HE HAD
A CLOSER CONNECTION TO HER.

21:59.085 --> 22:02.455
- WHEN HE WAS...
DONE WITH ME,

22:02.489 --> 22:04.957
HE HELD MY HAND

22:04.991 --> 22:06.959
AND HE SAID,

22:06.993 --> 22:09.996
"YOU'RE JUST LUCKY YOU NEVER
DID ANYTHING TO PISS ME OFF."

22:11.964 --> 22:14.834
WE GOTTA FIND THIS GUY.

22:19.005 --> 22:20.940
- I DON'T KNOW WHY ANYONE

22:20.973 --> 22:22.842
WOULD WANT TO HURT JENNIFER.

22:22.875 --> 22:24.377
- MODEL EMPLOYEE?

22:24.411 --> 22:25.945
- MODEL HUMAN BEING.

22:25.978 --> 22:28.047
AH, DON'T TOUCH
THE MERCHANDISE, PLEASE.

22:28.080 --> 22:30.116
- MAYBE HE WANTED TO BUY ME
SOMETHING PRETTY.

22:30.149 --> 22:31.984
IT IS OUR
TEN-YEAR ANNIVERSARY.

22:32.018 --> 22:33.986
- MAZEL TOV.

22:34.020 --> 22:35.855
- WAS JENNIFER SEEING ANYBODY?
- NO, NO.

22:35.888 --> 22:37.490
SHE HAD HER HEART BROKEN
A YEAR AGO,

22:37.524 --> 22:39.492
SPENT HER FREE TIME
DOING CHARITY WORK.

22:39.526 --> 22:41.728
- FOR WHO?
- [laughs] YOU NAME IT.

22:41.761 --> 22:45.031
SOUP KITCHENS,
COMMUNITY GARDENS...

22:45.064 --> 22:48.401
YOU KNOW, SHE USED TO
WRITE TO PRISONERS.

22:48.435 --> 22:50.670
I WARNED HER
NO GOOD WOULD COME OF IT.

22:50.703 --> 22:52.872
- DID SHE GO THROUGH
A PEN PAL SERVICE?

22:52.905 --> 22:54.140
- YEAH.
SHE THOUGHT IT WAS SAFE.

22:54.173 --> 22:57.143
THEY NEVER GAVE OUT
HOME ADDRESSES,

22:57.176 --> 22:59.646
AND THEY ONLY REACHED OUT
TO JEWISH INMATES.

22:59.679 --> 23:01.848
- WE GOT THE LIST
FROM PROJECT MITZVAH.

23:01.881 --> 23:03.983
JENNIFER'S CORRESPONDED
OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS

23:04.016 --> 23:05.518
WITH EIGHT DIFFERENT PRISONERS.

23:05.552 --> 23:07.019
- I GOTTA HAVE A CONNECTION
WITH ONE OF THEM.

23:07.053 --> 23:08.921
GIVE ME THE LIST.

23:08.955 --> 23:12.892
UH..."SAM MENDELSOHN.

23:12.925 --> 23:16.796
PETER SKOLNICK."

23:16.829 --> 23:18.898
NO. I DIDN'T PUT
ANY OF THESE GUYS AWAY.

23:18.931 --> 23:20.900
- FIVE OF 'EM
ARE STILL LOCKED UP.

23:20.933 --> 23:22.168
- WELL, THAT MEANS
THREE ARE OUT.

23:22.201 --> 23:24.103
LET'S PULL 'EM UP.

23:24.136 --> 23:25.638
- PAUL KLEIN.

23:25.672 --> 23:26.906
HE'S 5'4".
I THINK THAT RULES HIM OUT.

23:26.939 --> 23:28.174
- YEP.

23:28.207 --> 23:30.109
- JONATHAN MARKS.
5'11".

23:30.142 --> 23:31.878
HE'S IN THE BALLPARK.
- WELL, HE'S GOT VIOLENCE.

23:31.911 --> 23:33.713
IT SAYS THERE
HE KILLED HIS WIFE.

23:33.746 --> 23:34.914
- AND THEY LET THAT BOY OUT.

23:34.947 --> 23:37.884
- YEAH, COMPASSIONATE RELEASE.
THE MUG SHOT IS FROM '85.

23:37.917 --> 23:39.952
HE'S NOW IN HIS '70s
AND ON A VENTILATOR.

23:39.986 --> 23:41.187
- NEXT.

23:42.989 --> 23:45.692
SETH COLEMAN. HA!

23:45.725 --> 23:47.927
6'2', 224.
RELEASED LAST WEEK.

23:47.960 --> 23:50.630
THAT'S IT.
THAT'S HIM.

23:50.663 --> 23:52.064
- LEVEL THREE SEX OFFENDER.
- NO BODIES ON HIM.

23:52.098 --> 23:54.000
BUT HE CHOKED OUT
BOTH HIS VICTIMS.

23:54.033 --> 23:55.902
- IT'S GOTTA BE HIM.

23:55.935 --> 23:58.137
BUT HE'S NOT A PAT.
HE'S NOT A MEMBER OF S.C.B.

23:58.170 --> 23:59.972
WHAT IS HIS CONNECTION TO ME?

24:00.006 --> 24:01.974
- I HATE TO BE
A SELF-HATING JEW, BUT...

24:02.008 --> 24:05.011
HE DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
A MEMBER OF THE TRIBE TO ME.

24:08.080 --> 24:10.016
- SETH COLEMAN ISN'T JEWISH.

24:10.049 --> 24:13.920
BUT HE WAS A JAILHOUSE CONVERT
TO THE ARYAN BROTHERHOOD.

24:13.953 --> 24:16.856
I HAD TO CATALOGUE
HIS PRISON TATS.

24:16.889 --> 24:18.825
- HOW DID HE GET ON
THE JEWISH PRISONERS' LIST?

24:18.858 --> 24:21.628
- OH, HOW WOULD I KNOW?
TALK TO HIS PAROLE OFFICER.

24:21.661 --> 24:23.963
- WE DID.
COLEMAN NEVER CHECKED IN.

24:23.996 --> 24:25.765
- HE HAD THE PLEASURE
OF VISITING WITH YOU

24:25.798 --> 24:28.167
15 DAYS BEFORE HE GOT OUT
TO REGISTER AS A SEX OFFENDER.

24:28.200 --> 24:30.503
- YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO
VERIFY HIS PLACEMENT.

24:30.537 --> 24:32.939
- I DID.
HIS AUNT SAID SHE'D TAKE HIM.

24:32.972 --> 24:35.007
- SHE CHANGED HER MIND.
SHE GOT COLD FEET.

24:35.041 --> 24:36.776
- HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

24:36.809 --> 24:39.912
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW HARD
IT IS TO PLACE A SEX OFFENDER?

24:39.946 --> 24:42.782
- WHICH IS WHY
YOU SHOULD ALWAYS FOLLOW UP.

24:42.815 --> 24:44.517
- I DID MY JOB.

24:44.551 --> 24:47.887
FIRST ADDRESS HE GAVE ME HAD
A FELON LIVING IN THE BUILDING,

24:47.920 --> 24:49.155
AND I DENIED IT.

24:49.188 --> 24:51.858
- PLEASE TELL ME
YOU KEPT THAT ADDRESS.

24:51.891 --> 24:54.694
- WELL, THAT WAS A BUST.

24:54.727 --> 24:56.195
- THIS WHERE HE LIVES?

24:56.228 --> 24:58.931
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

24:58.965 --> 25:00.767
- SO YOU STALKING US NOW?

25:00.800 --> 25:02.535
- [chuckles]
- DANA.

25:02.569 --> 25:05.004
YOU KNOW THAT YOU CAN'T
BRING IN YOUR OWN RAPIST.

25:05.037 --> 25:07.674
- HEY, YOU HAD MY BACK.
NOW I'VE GOT YOURS.

25:07.707 --> 25:09.609
I TAKE IT HE WASN'T HOME.

25:09.642 --> 25:10.943
- YOU CAN TAKE IT
ANY WAY YOU WANT.

25:10.977 --> 25:11.844
JUST LET US DO OUR JOB.

25:11.878 --> 25:14.046
- UNLESS YOU WANNA
COMPROMISE THE CASE.

25:14.080 --> 25:17.950
YOU'RE THE ONLY LIVING WITNESS.
WE NEED A CLEAN I.D.

25:17.984 --> 25:20.052
- ASSUMING YOU
BRING HIM IN ALIVE.

25:20.086 --> 25:21.888
- GET OUTTA HERE NOW.

25:24.691 --> 25:26.726
- THAT'S HIM.

25:26.759 --> 25:28.661
- DANA,
GO BACK TO THE PRECINCT.

25:28.695 --> 25:31.698
SERIOUSLY, DANA,
LET US HANDLE IT.

25:36.068 --> 25:38.070
- COME ON, PAL, DON'T RUN.
MY KNEES ARE KILLING ME.

25:45.344 --> 25:48.114
- SHE'S GONNA RUN HIM OVER!

25:59.391 --> 26:02.929
- SHE'S NOT GONNA BE HAPPY
TILL SHE KILLS ME.

26:07.233 --> 26:08.200
- DANA?

26:08.234 --> 26:09.335
- BITCH!

26:09.368 --> 26:10.870
- COLEMAN.

26:10.903 --> 26:13.205
COLEMAN,
PUT THE NAIL GUN DOWN.

26:13.239 --> 26:15.107
- NO. SHE PUTS HERS DOWN
FIRST.

26:15.141 --> 26:17.977
- IT'S THREE TO ONE.
DON'T BE STUPID.

26:18.010 --> 26:19.879
- GOT YOU CORNERED.
CAN'T MOVE, CAN YOU?

26:19.912 --> 26:21.881
- I'M JUST DEFENDING MYSELF,
MAN.

26:21.914 --> 26:24.083
- ARE YOU PARALYZED YET?
HOW'S IT FEEL?

26:24.116 --> 26:25.985
- WOULD YOU PLEASE
ARREST THIS LUNATIC?

26:26.018 --> 26:27.186
- NO, NO, NO.
NO ONE'S GETTING ARRESTED HERE.

26:27.219 --> 26:28.287
- DANA.
- COME ON, SCUM.

26:28.320 --> 26:31.691
COME ON, COME ON, WE GOT
OURSELVES A FAIR FIGHT NOW.

26:31.724 --> 26:33.860
- ALL RIGHT, NO ONE
HAS TO GET HURT HERE.

26:33.893 --> 26:35.094
BOTH OF YOU, STAND DOWN.

26:35.127 --> 26:36.328
DANA, WE GOT HIM.

26:45.872 --> 26:47.606
- UNCLE.

26:48.941 --> 26:50.943
- NOBODY MOVE!
- AGENT LEWIS, THAT'S ENOUGH!

26:50.977 --> 26:52.311
- HE'S MINE!

26:52.344 --> 26:53.980
OKAY, COWARD.

26:54.013 --> 26:58.117
YOU FILTHY COWARD!

26:58.150 --> 26:59.919
MAKE PEACE WITH YOUR MAKER.

26:59.952 --> 27:02.088
- WHAT?
- GOT ANY LAST REQUESTS?

27:02.121 --> 27:03.690
- DON'T LET HER KILL ME.

27:03.723 --> 27:05.925
- HONEY, YOU ARE
ALREADY DEAD.

27:05.958 --> 27:07.894
[ricochet sound]
HOW'S IT FEEL

27:07.927 --> 27:09.762
TO BE POWERLESS, YOU MOTHER--
- DANA!

27:09.796 --> 27:11.931
- AH...

27:11.964 --> 27:15.868
- OH, MY GOD, WHAT HAPPENED?
- IT RICOCHETED OFF THE BEAM.

27:15.902 --> 27:16.969
- [quietly]
OH, MY GOD.

27:17.003 --> 27:19.872
- YOU OKAY?

27:27.113 --> 27:28.014
- [groans]
UH...

27:28.047 --> 27:29.982
[knock at door]

27:30.016 --> 27:30.850
OH, NO.

27:30.883 --> 27:35.087
- ELLIOT...
I AM SO SORRY.

27:37.289 --> 27:40.860
WELL, IT'S--IT'S ALL
THEY HAD IN THE GIFT SHOP.

27:41.994 --> 27:43.395
HOW YOU FEELING?

27:43.429 --> 27:45.031
I ALREADY FESSED UP.

27:45.064 --> 27:48.000
AND YOU'LL BE HAPPY TO KNOW
THAT THEY TOOK MY GUN AWAY

27:48.034 --> 27:50.837
AND, UM...
I'M SUSPENDED WITHOUT PAY.

27:50.870 --> 27:52.404
- YOU SHOULD BE.

27:52.438 --> 27:54.106
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

27:54.140 --> 27:56.408
YOU WERE OUT OF LINE
SHOOTING AT AN UNARMED MAN.

27:56.442 --> 27:58.177
- YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU'RE RIGHT.

27:58.210 --> 28:00.412
THE FACT THAT COLEMAN
RAPED AND TORTURED ME

28:00.446 --> 28:03.015
DOESN'T EXCUSE WHAT I DID.

28:07.386 --> 28:10.322
- LIV SAID THAT YOU TRIED
TO CRASH THE INTERROGATION.

28:10.356 --> 28:11.824
- I JUST WANT AN UPDATE.

28:11.858 --> 28:13.092
I HEAR THEY'VE BEEN
TAG-TEAMING HIM

28:13.125 --> 28:15.061
FOR OVER 12 HOURS.

28:15.094 --> 28:16.829
HAVE THEY GOT ANYTHING?

28:16.863 --> 28:19.966
- HE CONFESSED TO RAPING
AND MURDERING JENNIFER BRIGGS.

28:19.999 --> 28:21.934
THEY FOUND HIS DNA ON HER.

28:23.970 --> 28:27.106
- AND WHAT ABOUT ME?

28:27.139 --> 28:28.908
- I NEVER RAPED NO FBI SKIRT.

28:28.941 --> 28:30.276
- LOOK, YOU'RE ALREADY FACING
25 TO LIFE

28:30.309 --> 28:32.344
FOR JENNIFER'S MURDER.

28:32.378 --> 28:34.413
ADMITTING THAT YOU RAPED
AGENT LEWIS

28:34.446 --> 28:36.515
IS NOT GONNA ADD ANYTHING
TO YOUR SENTENCE.

28:36.548 --> 28:38.350
- BITCH AIN'T MY TYPE.
- YOUR TYPE?

28:38.384 --> 28:42.454
YOUR TYPE SEEMS TO BE
ANYTHING WITH...LADY PARTS.

28:42.488 --> 28:44.957
HMM?

28:44.991 --> 28:48.527
MAE LING.

28:48.560 --> 28:51.197
22-YEAR-OLD DOCTORAL STUDENT.

28:51.230 --> 28:52.999
DANIELLE FIGERETTI.

28:53.032 --> 28:56.068
43-YEAR-OLD. DIVORCED.
MOTHER OF FOUR.

28:56.102 --> 28:58.971
- IT'S BULL
THAT I DID SEVEN YEARS.

28:59.005 --> 29:00.439
THEY WERE BEGGING FOR IT.

29:00.472 --> 29:02.008
- WHY? 'CAUSE THEY WENT OUT
CLUBBING?

29:02.041 --> 29:03.876
- WELL, WHEN I WAS WORKIN'
THE DOOR,

29:03.910 --> 29:05.945
THEY WERE ALL OVER ME,

29:05.978 --> 29:07.947
WHISPERING IN MY EAR...

29:07.980 --> 29:10.549
SHAKING IT IN MY FACE.

29:10.582 --> 29:12.985
- I THINK THEY WERE JUST TRYING
TO GET PAST THE ROPE.

29:13.019 --> 29:15.021
- WELL, THEY GAVE ME
THEIR ADDRESSES.

29:15.054 --> 29:16.288
- YOU WERE CARDING THEM.

29:16.322 --> 29:20.026
NOW, BOTH OF THESE WOMEN
REJECTED YOU

29:20.059 --> 29:22.995
WHEN YOU ASKED THEM OUT.

29:23.029 --> 29:25.331
JUST LIKE JENNIFER.

29:27.133 --> 29:28.100
SHE STOPPED WRITING TO YOU

29:28.134 --> 29:32.038
WHEN YOU ASKED HER TO SEND YOU
NAKED PICTURES.

29:32.071 --> 29:33.840
- SHE WAS LOOKING
FOR A HUSBAND.

29:33.873 --> 29:36.108
WHY ELSE WOULD YOU WRITE
TO MEN IN PRISON?

29:36.142 --> 29:37.076
- I DON'T KNOW.

29:37.109 --> 29:38.845
WHY WOULD YOU

29:38.878 --> 29:41.080
SIGN UP FOR A JEWISH PEN PAL

29:41.113 --> 29:43.482
WHEN YOU'RE A NEO-NAZI?

29:43.515 --> 29:47.086
- I JUST HUNG OUT WITH THEM
FOR PROTECTION, OKAY?

29:47.119 --> 29:50.489
I'VE ALWAYS HAD A THING
FOR JEW GIRLS.

29:50.522 --> 29:53.392
THEY'RE FREAKS IN BED.

29:53.425 --> 29:55.928
- WHERE IS SHE EVEN GOING
WITH THIS LINE OF QUESTIONING?

29:55.962 --> 29:57.329
- SHE'S JUST TRYING
TO KEEP HIM TALKING.

29:57.363 --> 30:00.066
MAYBE HE'LL SLIP AND GIVE US
SOMETHING ON AGENT LEWIS.

30:00.099 --> 30:02.835
- A MISOGYNIST LIKE HIM
IS NOT GONNA CONFESS TO A WOMAN.

30:02.869 --> 30:05.905
- MUNCH AND FIN WENT AT HIM
FOR FIVE STRAIGHT HOURS.

30:05.938 --> 30:08.207
- WELL, I ONLY HAVE THREE HOURS
BEFORE I HAVE TO ARRAIGN HIM.

30:08.240 --> 30:10.977
GET THEM BACK HERE.

30:11.010 --> 30:13.512
- I UNDERSTAND DADDY
WAS A LOCKSMITH.

30:13.545 --> 30:15.314
- SO?
- PICKED UP SOME TRICKS.

30:15.347 --> 30:17.516
EXPLAINS HOW YOU GOT INTO
ALL THOSE APARTMENTS.

30:17.549 --> 30:20.586
- OH, HEY, YOU GOT ME, MAN.
NOW YOU KNOW ALL MY SECRETS.

30:20.619 --> 30:23.089
- WE ALSO KNOW THAT DANA'S
APARTMENT WAS BROKEN INTO.

30:23.122 --> 30:25.291
BY AN EXPERT.
- WHAT ARE YOU, DEAF?

30:25.324 --> 30:26.558
THAT WASN'T ME.
- THAT'S FUNNY.

30:26.592 --> 30:30.096
'CAUSE THE LAB JUST CONFIRMED
THAT THE PARALYTIC USED ON JENNY

30:30.129 --> 30:31.964
WAS THE EXACT SAME ONE
USED ON DANA.

30:31.998 --> 30:33.900
- WELL, I CAN'T BE
THE ONLY GUY IN NEW YORK

30:33.933 --> 30:35.301
THAT DOESN'T LIKE
THEIR WOMEN TO SQUIRM.

30:35.334 --> 30:37.003
- YOU'RE A MORON.

30:37.036 --> 30:39.138
THERE'S NO WAY YOU COULD HAVE
THOUGHT OF THIS ON YOUR OWN.

30:39.171 --> 30:41.273
DID SOME CROOKED DOCTOR
MAKE YOU HIS BFF ON THE INSIDE?

30:41.307 --> 30:43.409
- LOTTA RAPISTS IN THERE.

30:43.442 --> 30:46.078
WHAT, DO YOU GUYS HAVE
A THINK TANK, COMPARE NOTES?

30:46.112 --> 30:49.048
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

30:49.081 --> 30:51.183
I WANT A LAWYER.

30:54.086 --> 30:56.022
- SETH COLEMAN
REFUSED ALL PLEAS.

30:56.055 --> 30:57.589
WE'RE GOING TO TRIAL.
- I CAN'T.

30:57.623 --> 30:59.992
- DANA, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
GO THROUGH THIS ALONE.

31:00.026 --> 31:01.060
- OH, REALLY?
ARE YOU GONNA BE THERE

31:01.093 --> 31:03.495
WHEN MY COLLEAGUES
ORDER UP THE TRIAL TRANSCRIPTS

31:03.529 --> 31:04.964
AND PASS THEM AROUND
FOR KICKS?

31:04.997 --> 31:06.432
- THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

31:06.465 --> 31:08.267
- LOOK, THEY'LL NEVER
TAKE ME SERIOUSLY AGAIN.

31:08.300 --> 31:10.036
IF I CAN'T EVEN
WATCH MY OWN BACK,

31:10.069 --> 31:11.603
HOW ARE THEY EVER GONNA
TRUST ME TO WATCH THEIRS?

31:11.637 --> 31:13.906
- IT'S NOT EASY FOR ANYONE
TO CONFRONT THEIR ATTACKER,

31:13.940 --> 31:16.075
BUT YOU, OF ALL PEOPLE,
KNOW HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS.

31:16.108 --> 31:19.111
- FIRST OF ALL, I'M NOT AFRAID
TO CONFRONT MY OWN ATTACKER.

31:19.145 --> 31:20.512
BUT YOU'VE ALREADY GOT HIM
FOR MURDER--

31:20.546 --> 31:21.613
WHAT DO YOU NEED ME FOR?

31:21.647 --> 31:23.983
- I HAVE A LEGAL OBLIGATION
TO PROSECUTE THIS CASE.

31:24.016 --> 31:25.484
DON'T FORCE ME
TO SUBPOENA YOU.

31:25.517 --> 31:27.553
- MAKE IT GO AWAY.

31:27.586 --> 31:29.121
- DANA...

31:29.155 --> 31:30.489
IT'S THE ONLY WAY

31:30.522 --> 31:33.059
YOU'RE EVER GOING TO FIND
PEACE.

31:38.130 --> 31:39.665
[wolf whistle]

31:39.698 --> 31:41.167
- YOU'VE GOTTA STOP
FOLLOWING ME.

31:41.200 --> 31:43.169
- I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU
BRIBED TO GET IN HERE,

31:43.202 --> 31:45.237
BUT THIS IS A BAD IDEA.

31:45.271 --> 31:46.672
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

31:46.705 --> 31:49.641
YOU'RE GONNA COMPROMISE
THE CASE.

31:58.084 --> 31:59.451
- WE NEED TO TALK.

31:59.485 --> 32:02.021
- WHAT, SO YOU CAN
SHOOT AT ME AGAIN?

32:02.054 --> 32:04.356
- IF I WANTED YOU DEAD,
YOU'D BE IN A PINEY BOX,

32:04.390 --> 32:05.657
NOT THIS LAP OF LUXURY.

32:05.691 --> 32:09.161
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?
- AN EXPLANATION.

32:09.195 --> 32:11.363
WHY ME?

32:14.166 --> 32:16.468
- DREAM ON, LADY.
I DON'T KNOW YOU.

32:16.502 --> 32:19.638
- I KNOW IT WAS YOU.
- YOU'RE WRONG. GUARD!

32:19.671 --> 32:22.308
- I RECOGNIZE YOUR VOICE.

32:22.341 --> 32:24.076
I REMEMBER YOUR SMELL.

32:24.110 --> 32:26.112
- GET THIS CRAZY BROAD
OUT OF HERE!

32:26.145 --> 32:30.049
- PLEASE...I NEED TO KNOW--
WHY ME?

32:30.082 --> 32:33.752
YOU TELL ME WHY ME.
WHAT WAS IN IT FOR YOU?

32:33.785 --> 32:35.054
WHY ME?
- DANA.

32:35.087 --> 32:36.422
- I NEED TO KNOW.
- COME ON.

32:36.455 --> 32:38.024
- WAIT. JUST WAIT.
WHY ME?

32:38.057 --> 32:39.992
YOU TELL ME, WHY ME?
- WE HAVE TO GO.

32:40.026 --> 32:42.128
- TELL ME WHY YOU RAPED ME.
WHY.

32:42.161 --> 32:43.195
- LET'S GO. ENOUGH.

32:44.696 --> 32:47.499
- BYE-BYE.
SWEET DREAMS.

32:47.533 --> 32:49.535
I KNOW I WILL.

32:52.371 --> 32:55.741
- SO YOU SAW HIS FACE.
- HE WORE A MASK.

32:55.774 --> 32:58.377
- ANY IDENTIFYING MARKS
ON HIS BODY?

32:58.410 --> 33:00.312
- I COULDN'T OPEN MY EYES.

33:00.346 --> 33:03.015
MY ATTACKER USED
A PARALYTIC AGENT.

33:03.049 --> 33:05.451
- BUT YOU SAW
THAT IT WAS MY CLIENT.

33:05.484 --> 33:08.554
- I TOLD YOU I COULDN'T.
HE PARALYZED ME.

33:08.587 --> 33:11.490
- BUT YOU KNEW IT WAS HIM.

33:11.523 --> 33:13.259
- I HEARD HIS VOICE.

33:13.292 --> 33:15.294
- HMM.

33:15.327 --> 33:18.030
DID YOU PICK HIM OUT
FROM A VOICE LINEUP?

33:18.064 --> 33:19.665
- NO.
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

33:19.698 --> 33:22.301
THEY COULDN'T DO ONE BECAUSE
WHEN YOU HEARD MY CLIENT,

33:22.334 --> 33:25.071
HE WAS PLEADING FOR HIS LIFE...
- OBJECTION.

33:25.104 --> 33:26.372
- WHEN YOU SHOT AT HIM.
- OVERRULED.

33:26.405 --> 33:27.173
- I NEVER INTENDED--
- YOU SHOT AT AN UNARMED MAN

33:27.206 --> 33:28.774
WHO WAS SURRENDERING
AT THE TIME.

33:28.807 --> 33:30.176
- I ONLY WANTED TO--

33:30.209 --> 33:31.243
- YOU PICKED MY CLIENT OUT
ON THE STREET

33:31.277 --> 33:33.512
AND TRIED TO RUN HIM OVER
WITH YOUR MOTORCYCLE!

33:33.545 --> 33:35.147
- I WAS GIVING CHASE.

33:35.181 --> 33:37.083
- DID YOU IDENTIFY YOURSELF
AS LAW ENFORCEMENT?

33:37.116 --> 33:38.350
- NO.

33:40.152 --> 33:42.554
- YOU'RE NOT A MEMBER
OF THE NYPD.

33:42.588 --> 33:45.057
- I'M A SPECIAL AGENT

33:45.091 --> 33:47.293
WITH THE FEDERAL
BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION.

33:47.326 --> 33:50.562
- AND SINCE WHEN DOES
THE BUREAU HAVE JURISDICTION

33:50.596 --> 33:52.798
OVER MANHATTAN RAPE CASES?

33:52.831 --> 33:54.100
- I WAS INVESTIGATING
MY OWN RAPE.

33:54.133 --> 33:56.202
- INTERFERING IS MORE LIKE IT.

33:56.235 --> 33:57.536
YOU TOOK YOUR OWN RAPE KIT,

33:57.569 --> 34:00.539
WHICH PRODUCED NO EVIDENCE
POINTING TO MY CLIENT.

34:00.572 --> 34:04.176
AND WHEN DETECTIVES TOLD YOU
HE'D RAPED ANOTHER WOMAN,

34:04.210 --> 34:06.345
YOU JUMPED ON BOARD--
MAYBE FOR THE ATTENTION.

34:06.378 --> 34:07.813
- THIS IS BULL.

34:07.846 --> 34:10.682
- IS THERE REALLY ANY EVIDENCE
THAT YOU WERE EVEN RAPED?

34:10.716 --> 34:11.817
I MEAN,
OTHER THAN YOUR OWN WORD.

34:11.850 --> 34:15.354
AND GIVEN YOUR RECENT ACTIONS,
THAT ISN'T WORTH MUCH.

34:15.387 --> 34:17.123
- OBJECTION!
- WITHDRAWN.

34:17.156 --> 34:19.091
I'M DONE WITH THIS WITNESS.

34:19.125 --> 34:22.361
- REDIRECT, YOUR HONOR.
- PROCEED.

34:22.394 --> 34:24.463
- DANA.

34:24.496 --> 34:26.465
ON THE EVENING OF THE RAPE

34:26.498 --> 34:29.168
WHEN YOU ENTERED
YOUR APARTMENT,

34:29.201 --> 34:31.137
WHAT'S THE FIRST SOUND
YOU REMEMBER HEARING?

34:31.170 --> 34:34.273
- AN OOF...

34:34.306 --> 34:36.508
WHEN I ELBOWED HIM
IN THE RIBS.

34:36.542 --> 34:38.877
THIS IS WHILE HE WAS CHOKING ME.
I WAS AIMING FOR HIS NUTS.

34:38.910 --> 34:41.880
- DID HE EVER SAY
ANYTHING TO YOU?

34:41.913 --> 34:43.649
- YEAH. HE WAS A TALKER.

34:43.682 --> 34:47.453
AND WHEN I CAME TO
ON THE BED,

34:47.486 --> 34:49.588
HE WAS CHATTERING ON
ABOUT...

34:49.621 --> 34:52.124
YOU KNOW...

34:52.158 --> 34:54.293
SEX STUFF.

34:54.326 --> 34:55.894
- WHAT DID HE SAY TO YOU?

34:55.927 --> 34:59.165
- IS THIS REALLY NECESSARY?

34:59.198 --> 35:01.900
- ANSWER THE QUESTION.

35:01.933 --> 35:04.503
WHAT EXACTLY DID HE SAY?

35:12.644 --> 35:16.582
- WHILE HE WAS UNBUTTONING
MY BLOUSE...

35:16.615 --> 35:20.519
HE COMMENTED
ON MY BLACK LACE BRASSIERE

35:20.552 --> 35:23.622
AND WHAT A DIRTY
LITTLE SLUT I WAS.

35:23.655 --> 35:25.157
- ANYTHING ELSE?

35:27.859 --> 35:33.532
- WHEN HE RIPPED...

35:33.565 --> 35:35.401
MY PANTIES OFF,

35:35.434 --> 35:37.803
HE TOLD ME THAT
HE KNEW I COULDN'T MOVE

35:37.836 --> 35:40.206
BUT HE HOPED
I WAS AWAKE FOR IT.

35:40.239 --> 35:42.808
THEN HE SLAPPED ME
SEVERAL TIMES ACROSS THE FACE

35:42.841 --> 35:43.942
AND CURSED AT ME.

35:43.975 --> 35:46.878
- WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?

35:46.912 --> 35:49.481
- HE BIT MY BREAST.

35:49.515 --> 35:52.751
AND I HEARD HIM
UNZIP HIS PANTS.

35:59.691 --> 36:02.294
THEN HE...

36:10.536 --> 36:11.703
HE...

36:15.707 --> 36:18.377
HE PULLED MY JAW OPEN
AS FAR AS IT WOULD GO,

36:18.410 --> 36:21.913
AND HE...

36:21.947 --> 36:26.585
I COULDN'T BREATHE.

36:26.618 --> 36:28.954
- DO YOU NEED A MINUTE?

36:28.987 --> 36:30.889
- NO.

36:32.924 --> 36:34.593
HE--

36:37.763 --> 36:40.599
HE SAID I HAD
A VELVET THROAT.

36:42.768 --> 36:44.936
AND HE...

36:44.970 --> 36:50.942
STUCK HIS FINGERS IN ME
AND...

36:50.976 --> 36:53.679
SAID HE WAS GLAD
I WAS ENJOYING MYSELF.

36:56.648 --> 37:01.987
THAT'S WHEN I FELT THE FULL
WEIGHT OF HIS BODY ON ME

37:02.020 --> 37:04.690
AND HIS BELLY...

37:11.830 --> 37:16.668
SLAPPING...AGAINST ME.

37:16.702 --> 37:20.639
AND...HE SAID,

37:20.672 --> 37:23.842
"YOU SURE ARE A STAR."

37:26.378 --> 37:28.880
AND I...I JUST...

37:31.517 --> 37:37.022
I JUST...
WANTED TO DIE.

37:37.055 --> 37:39.858
I JUST--OH, GOD.

37:39.891 --> 37:41.593
[sniffles]

37:44.796 --> 37:47.533
- LET'S TAKE
A TEN-MINUTE RECESS.

37:57.976 --> 38:00.846
- DANA.

38:00.879 --> 38:03.882
HE CALLED YOU STAR?

38:08.687 --> 38:11.089
- I SHOULDA
PUT IT TOGETHER MYSELF.

38:11.122 --> 38:13.859
BUT I HAVEN'T USED THAT ALIAS
STAR MORRISON

38:13.892 --> 38:15.361
IN OVER FOUR YEARS.

38:15.394 --> 38:17.596
- IT'S THE ONLY NAME
BRIAN ACKERMAN KNEW YOU BY.

38:17.629 --> 38:19.365
- THERE'S THE CONNECTION
TO SETH COLEMAN.

38:19.398 --> 38:21.500
BRIAN RAN THE REVOLUTION-ARYAN
WARRIORS,

38:21.533 --> 38:24.503
AND HE'S DOING LIFE IN ATTICA.
- WHERE YOU PUT HIM.

38:24.536 --> 38:26.872
- THIS IS PAYBACK.

38:26.905 --> 38:29.408
I KILLED HIS SON, KYLE.

38:29.441 --> 38:32.043
TO SAVE YOUR AMPLE ASS
IN THAT COURTROOM SHOOT-OUT.

38:32.077 --> 38:33.779
- DOESN'T MAKE US EVEN.

38:33.812 --> 38:37.983
- LOOK, JUST PLAY NICE.
IT'S A LONG RIDE UPSTATE.

38:42.020 --> 38:44.723
- BRIAN ACKERMAN.

38:44.756 --> 38:48.360
LONG TIME NO SEE.
HOW'S PRISON TREATING YOU?

38:48.394 --> 38:53.131
- IT'S GIVING ME A WHOLE NEW
POPULATION TO EDUCATE.

38:53.164 --> 38:55.834
THE REVOLUTION-ARYAN
WARRIORS ARE STRONGER THAN EVER.

38:55.867 --> 38:56.935
- REALLY?

38:56.968 --> 38:59.805
SINCE YOU WENT AWAY,
WE ELECTED A BLACK PRESIDENT.

38:59.838 --> 39:01.006
- YEAH. I HEAR HE'S MUSLIM.

39:01.039 --> 39:04.843
- DON'T BELIEVE EVERYTHING
YOU READ ON YOUR OWN WEBSITE.

39:04.876 --> 39:08.414
- HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY
THAT DIMWIT SETH COLEMAN

39:08.447 --> 39:10.882
TO TRACK ME DOWN AND RAPE ME?

39:10.916 --> 39:14.486
- UH...IT WAS A BARGAIN
AT TWICE THE PRICE.

39:14.520 --> 39:16.622
YOU ENJOY
YOUR EVENING WITH HIM?

39:18.189 --> 39:20.426
- YOU'RE CONFESSING.

39:20.459 --> 39:22.928
- WELL, I'M ALREADY
DOING LIFE...RIGHT?

39:22.961 --> 39:26.898
I MEAN,
WHAT MORE CAN YOU DO TO ME?

39:26.932 --> 39:31.503
HARDLY MAKES US EVEN FOR YOU
KILLING MY SON KYLE, BUT...

39:31.537 --> 39:34.540
IT'S A START, I GUESS.

39:34.573 --> 39:37.075
- NO MORE ACCESS
TO YOUR BAND OF LOSERS,

39:37.108 --> 39:38.810
NO MORE PRIVILEGES.

39:41.713 --> 39:45.784
ENJOY YOUR LIFETIME
SPENT IN SOLITARY.

39:49.955 --> 39:54.560
- HEY, DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S
GONNA GET ME THROUGH, STAR?

39:54.593 --> 39:59.164
REPLAYING EVERYTHING
COLEMAN DID TO YOU.

39:59.197 --> 40:03.435
- NAME'S DANA.

40:03.469 --> 40:07.205
AND I'M GONNA GET PAST THIS.

40:07.238 --> 40:11.710
I'M GONNA GO HOME
TO MY LOVIN' HUSBAND,

40:11.743 --> 40:14.913
AND I'M GOING TO WATCH
MY KIDS GROW UP.

40:14.946 --> 40:19.785
UNLIKE YOU,
I'M GOING TO HAVE A LIFE.
