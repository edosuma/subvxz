-[fire crackling]
-[knife swishing]

00:16.641 --> 00:18.643
How long it take you to load that thing?

00:20.103 --> 00:21.438
Seconds.

00:23.356 --> 00:25.066
Holds six rounds.

00:29.362 --> 00:31.156
[deep rumbling]

00:31.239 --> 00:33.241
[dark music playing]

00:35.535 --> 00:36.870
You all right, sir?

00:38.663 --> 00:40.415
Something has changed.

00:43.501 --> 00:46.421
Another is here.

00:47.964 --> 00:49.132
[munching] Mmm…

00:51.342 --> 00:52.177
Mmm…

00:53.094 --> 00:55.305
Save some for the rest of us.

00:56.181 --> 00:58.641
Oh, you must be
going through a growth spurt, bud.

00:58.725 --> 00:59.851
Mmm.

00:59.934 --> 01:02.395
First come, first serve.

01:05.690 --> 01:06.649
Tyler coming down?

01:10.236 --> 01:12.781
I don't know. He's pissed at me
for lying about the police report.

01:13.823 --> 01:15.325
[mouthful] What police report?

01:15.992 --> 01:18.661
The one I told him I filed.
About the intruders.

01:19.746 --> 01:21.081
Oh, right.

01:21.164 --> 01:22.415
[Nina] I know it's frustrating,

01:22.499 --> 01:25.919
but you guys figured out how to talk to me
back when I couldn't understand magic.

01:27.003 --> 01:28.755
I'm sure you'll find a way with Tyler too.

01:29.339 --> 01:30.548
Hope so.

01:30.632 --> 01:33.885
I guess things have
really changed around here.

01:33.968 --> 01:37.597
Well, yeah! They have, thanks to you.

01:38.973 --> 01:41.851
-Kinsey, you gonna be home tonight?
-[Kinsey] Should be, yeah.

01:41.935 --> 01:45.230
[Nina] Great. Well, I have dinner plans,
but I shouldn't be too long.

01:47.690 --> 01:49.526
Bode! What the hell?

01:49.609 --> 01:51.111
[Nina] Why did you just do that?

01:51.194 --> 01:53.655
There was a bug!
I was just trying to protect you.

01:53.738 --> 01:57.992
Okay. Well, maybe next time,
just, uh, give me a heads-up instead.

01:59.077 --> 02:00.203
[sighs angrily]

02:00.286 --> 02:02.288
[foreboding music playing]

02:08.753 --> 02:11.256
You know, if you really wanna protect us,

02:12.215 --> 02:13.758
be careful with the keys.

02:16.177 --> 02:20.140
I found this in the Ghost Door.
Were you playing around with it?

02:21.724 --> 02:25.103
Uh, yeah. I'll just…

02:25.937 --> 02:27.939
[music intensifies]

02:31.276 --> 02:32.777
…take that back.

02:33.653 --> 02:35.697
Don't leave it lying around. Okay?

02:36.197 --> 02:38.408
I won't. I promise.

02:42.453 --> 02:43.329
[exhales]

02:43.997 --> 02:47.542
Hey, maybe we should
take a look at the other keys,

02:48.293 --> 02:50.628
just to make sure
they're all accounted for.

02:50.712 --> 02:51.880
I got it covered.

02:51.963 --> 02:55.466
Okay, hungry man, finish up.
We're leaving for school in ten minutes.

02:55.550 --> 02:59.804
Uh… actually,
I think it's conference day.

02:59.888 --> 03:01.598
Teachers go in. Kids stay home.

03:01.681 --> 03:05.310
[chuckling] Yeah, I don't think so.
Go brush your teeth.

03:06.519 --> 03:08.521
[adventurous music playing]

03:10.732 --> 03:11.858

[music continues]

03:13.526 --> 03:15.528
[birds cawing]

03:23.203 --> 03:25.330
Nice try with the mug, asshole!

03:25.955 --> 03:29.083
But now, I got your mommy
wrapped around my little finger,

03:29.167 --> 03:31.544
and I can snatch up any key that I want.

03:32.420 --> 03:34.214
But look at the bright side.

03:34.297 --> 03:36.257
You always had fun being a ghost.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.843
Now you get to be one forever.

03:39.844 --> 03:43.097
Oh, and if you try
and send any more messages,

03:43.932 --> 03:45.391
I'll kill your whole family.

03:45.475 --> 03:47.477
[music continues]

04:13.503 --> 04:14.963
[sentimental music playing]

04:15.046 --> 04:17.674
[Tyler] Isn't it someone's 18th birthday
coming up in a few weeks?

04:18.591 --> 04:19.509
[Jackie] Mm-hmm.

04:20.885 --> 04:22.637
Gotta do something epic to celebrate.

04:22.720 --> 04:24.222
-Epic?
-Mmm.

04:24.305 --> 04:25.723
Well, that's a high bar.

04:26.391 --> 04:28.393
-Let me worry about that.
-[chuckles]

-[doorbell rings]
-[gasps]

04:30.895 --> 04:32.730
[exhales]

04:41.698 --> 04:43.658
-Carly?
-Hey.

04:44.284 --> 04:47.328
H-Hi, I-- What? Um…

04:47.412 --> 04:49.539
So, you're okay?

04:49.622 --> 04:51.958
-Uh, yeah, I'm okay. I--
-[Carly] You sure?

04:52.041 --> 04:53.668
Can you speak freely?

04:53.751 --> 04:57.046
Like, pull on your ear
if you're actually okay.

05:02.343 --> 05:05.096
Wait. You… You didn't drive
all the way from Montana

05:05.179 --> 05:07.098
because you were
worried about me, did you?

05:07.682 --> 05:08.808
You little shit!

05:08.891 --> 05:11.519
You do not get to turn me
into the crazy person here.

05:11.602 --> 05:13.479
But, come on,
you knew I had my uncle's wedding.

05:13.563 --> 05:15.481
Several days ago!

05:15.565 --> 05:18.860
You don't show up for work.
You don't answer any of my texts.

05:18.943 --> 05:20.945
I didn't know
if something horrible had happened--

05:21.029 --> 05:24.157
You're right. I should have written back.
I'm sorry. I just… I…

05:25.908 --> 05:27.618
You never struck me as a worrier.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.413
I'm not.

05:30.955 --> 05:33.374
I just… I… I don't like it

05:33.458 --> 05:37.420
when people I care about
just go silent all of a sudden.

05:40.006 --> 05:44.010
[scoffs] Hey! I mean,
you're obviously okay, and you're just…

05:44.093 --> 05:45.053
Yeah.

05:45.136 --> 05:46.387
This is your house?

05:47.430 --> 05:50.475
I don't know what I was expecting,

05:50.558 --> 05:53.269
but this is not it.

05:55.688 --> 05:58.358
-Do you wanna come inside?
-Mmm, nah.

05:59.192 --> 06:02.445
I think I'm gonna turn around
and drive back.

06:03.446 --> 06:04.989
Of course I'm coming in.

06:05.073 --> 06:08.534
This place looks amazing.
Give me the whole ten-cent tour.

06:08.618 --> 06:12.038
All right. Well, we, um, we can start
with the very '70s basement.

06:12.121 --> 06:13.247
Okay.

06:17.877 --> 06:20.338
-[school bell ringing]
-[indistinct chatter]

06:21.923 --> 06:24.342
Oh, look. There's Josh and Jamie.

06:24.425 --> 06:27.011
Oh, how thrilling for all of us.

06:27.637 --> 06:28.596
Good morning!

06:29.097 --> 06:30.306
-[Nina] Hi there.
-Hi.

06:31.766 --> 06:33.851
Hey, cool kicks, Bode. Very old-school.

06:33.935 --> 06:35.478
You would know, dinosaur.

06:40.066 --> 06:40.983
Bye, Dad.

06:41.067 --> 06:42.151
Okay, bye.

06:42.735 --> 06:46.531
Oh, wow. Never knew my self-esteem
could take such a hit from a fifth-grader.

06:46.614 --> 06:49.242
That was not like him. I'm so sorry.

06:49.325 --> 06:50.910
I will wear him down over time.

06:52.453 --> 06:54.497
He needs a chance
to get to know you better.

06:54.580 --> 06:55.623
Yeah.

06:55.706 --> 07:00.336
Maybe, um, we can invite the kids
to come along on our dinner date tonight.

07:00.837 --> 07:02.922
It could give you guys a chance to bond.

07:03.005 --> 07:03.881
Mm-hmm.

07:04.799 --> 07:08.428
-I'm down for the challenge.
-[laughs] No, he'll come around.

07:10.805 --> 07:12.223
Can I ask you something?

07:13.975 --> 07:14.892
[sighs]

07:15.810 --> 07:19.814
Why didn't you tell me that you guys had
a break-in during Duncan's wedding?

07:21.607 --> 07:22.692
Tyler told me.

07:23.818 --> 07:24.819
Oh, um…

07:26.320 --> 07:27.447
I, uh…

07:28.364 --> 07:30.575
I didn't wanna ruin
a happy day for anyone.

07:31.367 --> 07:33.703
Or be the damsel in distress.

07:33.786 --> 07:35.830
[Josh] I would hope
with something that big,

07:37.457 --> 07:39.876
we could share those things
with each other.

07:42.462 --> 07:43.463
You're right.

07:44.380 --> 07:46.924
Um, in the future, I will.

07:48.509 --> 07:50.511
[dark music playing]

08:00.104 --> 08:01.814
Why'd you say that to my dad?

08:02.315 --> 08:03.566
It was just a joke.

08:04.066 --> 08:05.026
Okay.

08:05.526 --> 08:09.030
So are you ready for the science test?
I was up half the night studying.

08:10.239 --> 08:11.073
Oops.

08:11.157 --> 08:12.158
Sorry.

08:13.701 --> 08:15.745
[in gruff voice] Listen here, shit stain.

08:15.828 --> 08:18.164
Do that again,
and I'll rip out your entrails.

08:18.247 --> 08:20.249
[music continues]

08:27.048 --> 08:28.049
[Tyler and Carly laughing]

08:28.132 --> 08:29.884
[Carly] I've seen him
hide candy bars at work.

08:29.967 --> 08:32.512
[Tyler] That's…
That's like dietary infidelity.

08:33.095 --> 08:36.098
[Carly] Is it though? If they're
still paleo when they're together.

08:36.182 --> 08:39.685
-[Tyler] It absolutely is. It's 100%.
-[Carly laughing]

08:39.769 --> 08:42.563
[Carly laughing] People will believe
what they want to believe.

08:43.189 --> 08:44.357
[Kinsey] Uh, hi.

08:45.608 --> 08:46.484
Hi.

08:48.736 --> 08:51.906
Uh, this, um… this is my sister, Kinsey.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.867
-Hi.
-Hey, I'm Carly.

08:56.786 --> 08:58.621
Tyler's friend from Montana?

09:00.289 --> 09:03.376
I guess someone forgot to mention me, huh?

09:03.459 --> 09:06.462
Lucky for him,
I don't get offended easily. [chuckles]

09:06.546 --> 09:07.421
I was… [chuckles]

09:07.505 --> 09:08.631
I was just, um…

09:08.714 --> 09:10.841
I just knew that I couldn't, um…

09:11.551 --> 09:14.387
I couldn't convey
the full extent of your splendor to--

09:14.470 --> 09:17.098
Yeah, stop digging.
You're already in a hole.

09:19.267 --> 09:21.269
So are you staying with us?

09:21.811 --> 09:23.604
Oh… Um…

09:24.188 --> 09:26.983
I'm sure I can, like,
find a hotel somewhere or--

09:27.066 --> 09:29.318
Don't be stupid.
Of course you're staying with us.

09:29.944 --> 09:31.946
Really? You don't mind?

09:32.029 --> 09:33.906
I mean, we have so many extra rooms.

09:35.533 --> 09:37.285
Right. Cool.

09:39.245 --> 09:41.831
-Uh, you wanna head up?
-[Carly] Yeah, let's do it.

09:44.500 --> 09:46.210
Would you wanna come along?

09:46.294 --> 09:48.629
We're gonna go get chowder at, um…

09:48.713 --> 09:51.299
What's that place called again? Phil's?

09:51.382 --> 09:52.633
-Bill's.
-Bill's.

09:54.635 --> 09:56.220
Yeah, you should come if you want.

09:58.180 --> 10:00.850
No, you guys go. I… I got homework to do.

10:01.392 --> 10:02.643
I'll catch you later.

10:04.854 --> 10:06.731
-I'll drive?
-[Carly] Wow!

10:07.481 --> 10:10.318
Where was that chivalry
when you ghosted me?

10:10.401 --> 10:12.570
Well, I'm just gonna
grab my jacket quickly.

10:15.197 --> 10:17.199
[dark music playing]

10:21.203 --> 10:23.205
[jewelry clinking]

10:41.891 --> 10:42.892
[objects clattering]

10:42.975 --> 10:44.268
[music continues]

10:49.231 --> 10:51.233
[music intensifies]

10:53.611 --> 10:54.695
[music ends]

10:56.197 --> 10:58.491
Am I supposed to know who you are?

10:59.909 --> 11:01.869
You must be the little brother.

11:01.952 --> 11:02.953
[door closes]

11:03.037 --> 11:03.954
Guess I must.

11:04.538 --> 11:08.834
Oh, Bode, this is, um, this is Carly.
She's visiting me from Montana.

11:09.377 --> 11:14.382
Way to go, Tyler, you sly dog.
You always were into brunettes.

11:16.842 --> 11:17.718
Funny.

11:18.302 --> 11:20.888
[Nina] Hey, bud! Hurry up,
or we're gonna be late

11:20.971 --> 11:23.099
for dinner with Josh and Jamie.

11:23.182 --> 11:24.600
Wouldn't want that!

11:27.770 --> 11:30.940
Well, your brother's got
his East Coast attitude down pat.

11:31.023 --> 11:33.734
Sorry, he's… he's not usually like that.

11:33.818 --> 11:36.153
[dark music playing]

11:51.085 --> 11:53.587
God, this kid is such a nerd!

12:09.061 --> 12:11.063
[suspenseful music playing]

12:31.167 --> 12:34.754
And some guac for the table, please.
Thanks. Guacamole.

12:35.421 --> 12:36.881
[munching]

12:36.964 --> 12:39.675
So, Bode, your mom tells me
that you're really into Lego.

12:39.759 --> 12:43.095
I was something of a master at that
when I was in high school.

12:43.179 --> 12:45.973
Wow, you must have had
an active social life.

12:46.766 --> 12:49.059
[Josh] I mean, yeah,
I was definitely one of those kids

12:49.143 --> 12:51.187
who blossomed during college.

12:51.270 --> 12:56.150
Although, even then, I was the kind who
would rather be studying than having fun.

12:56.734 --> 12:58.903
-I'm shocked.
-Hey!

13:00.196 --> 13:01.864
What were you studying?

13:01.947 --> 13:04.116
How to be a high school history teacher?

13:04.700 --> 13:05.618
Bode.

13:05.701 --> 13:08.454
[Josh] Well, I guess it doesn't seem cool,

13:08.537 --> 13:11.081
but being a teacher was always my dream.

13:11.165 --> 13:14.251
And, you know,
history has some great stories.

13:17.296 --> 13:20.466
You might wanna slow down on the chips.
You'll ruin your appetite.

13:20.549 --> 13:22.968
Hey, relax, cheapskate.
They're bottomless.

13:23.052 --> 13:25.554
Uh-- Apologize right now.

13:27.097 --> 13:28.891
I'm sorry. I was just kidding.

13:29.517 --> 13:33.103
I don't know what's gotten into you,
but you better shape up, fast.

13:34.939 --> 13:37.566
-Nina? [chuckles]
-Gordie! [laughs]

13:37.650 --> 13:38.859
So good to see you.

13:38.943 --> 13:41.737
I don't mean to interrupt, but I had
to let you know what a wonderful job

13:41.821 --> 13:44.406
Kinsey and her friends are doing
on the film for the Matheson website.

13:44.490 --> 13:46.408
It's gonna be a heck of an ad
for the town.

13:46.492 --> 13:48.077
[Nina] Oh, I'm so glad to hear it.

13:48.160 --> 13:52.248
Do you know, uh, Josh Bennett?
He teaches history at the academy.

13:52.331 --> 13:54.500
-[audio muffles]
-[Gordie] I've heard good things.

13:54.583 --> 13:56.794
