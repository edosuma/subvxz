WEBVTT

00:06.606 --> 00:09.475
Normally, I'd start
with the drill or a scalpel--

00:09.477 --> 00:10.642
Peeling off the skin
can be beautiful--

00:10.644 --> 00:12.411
Or removing fingers, toes.

00:12.413 --> 00:15.114
I like the feeling of a toe
being separated from a foot.

00:15.116 --> 00:17.016
But with you,
because we're friends,

00:17.018 --> 00:19.251
Because we're family,
I won't do any of that.

00:19.253 --> 00:22.121
Consider it the friends
and family discount.

00:22.123 --> 00:25.024
I'm disappointed in you,
quinn.

00:25.026 --> 00:27.459
You've been a bad girl.
(whimpering)

00:27.461 --> 00:30.062
And I need to know exactly
what you've been up to.

00:30.064 --> 00:32.498
But, before we start,

00:32.500 --> 00:34.700
(whispers)
I just wanna say...

00:34.702 --> 00:37.102
I'm sorry.

00:37.104 --> 00:39.238
(normal voice) I'm so sorry
because I'm gonna enjoy this.

00:39.240 --> 00:42.107
I'm gonna love it
and I don't want to, but...

00:42.109 --> 00:45.644
(muffled crying)
you're so fresh, so new,

00:45.646 --> 00:48.647
Y-y--soft,
and I've never done this

00:48.649 --> 00:51.517
With someone in the family,
someone I love, and that's...

00:51.519 --> 00:53.152
(continues crying)

00:53.154 --> 00:54.753
I'm sorry.
I just need to...

00:54.755 --> 00:58.357
(panting)

01:02.829 --> 01:04.830
I won't kill you.

01:04.832 --> 01:08.267
(voice breaks)
I promise!

01:08.269 --> 01:11.136
I'm gonna start
with your teeth.

01:11.138 --> 01:13.772
(muffled) mnh-mnh.

01:13.774 --> 01:15.307
It's, uh, very effective,

01:15.309 --> 01:18.343
The pain of having your teeth
ripped from your gums

01:18.345 --> 01:19.678
One by one with a pair
of pliers.

01:19.680 --> 01:22.247
It's, well,
it's... It's special.
Mnh-mnh! Mnh-mnh

01:22.249 --> 01:26.085
(crying) oh, huck, huck,
huck, please, don't, don't.

01:26.087 --> 01:27.286
Please, don't.

01:27.288 --> 01:29.721
I didn't do anything.
I didn't.

01:29.723 --> 01:34.726
I'll be good, I'll be good,
I'll be good, I'll be--aah!

01:34.728 --> 01:36.295
Aah. (panting)
shh. Shh. Shh.

01:36.297 --> 01:38.530
Don't try to talk.
Not now, okay?

01:38.532 --> 01:41.733
We're gonna rip a little,
and then we're gonna talk.

01:41.735 --> 01:43.769
That's how it works.

01:43.771 --> 01:45.737
Rip a little, talk a little.
Unh-unh. Unh-unh.

01:45.739 --> 01:48.140
You can scream now
if you want.

01:48.142 --> 01:51.777
Screaming's okay with me.
(screaming)

01:51.779 --> 01:53.545
(cell phone ringing)

01:53.547 --> 01:55.848
(ring)

01:55.850 --> 01:58.183
(ring)

01:58.185 --> 01:59.751
(ring)

01:59.753 --> 02:01.520
(ring)

02:01.522 --> 02:04.389
(ring)
hello?

02:04.391 --> 02:06.391
(whispering) she's alive.

02:06.393 --> 02:07.726
Who?

02:07.728 --> 02:08.894
My mother.

02:08.896 --> 02:09.862
She's not dead.

02:09.864 --> 02:12.397
She's alive
and she's here.

02:12.399 --> 02:13.799
She's here in my apartment,
and I don't--
olivia--

02:13.801 --> 02:16.135
She's alive and she's here.
What do I do?

02:16.137 --> 02:18.403
She's not dead.
How do I--
olivia!

02:18.405 --> 02:20.172
Stop talking right now.

02:20.174 --> 02:21.907
Hang up your cell phone
and take out the battery.

02:21.909 --> 02:23.375
Get your mother
and get out of your apartment

02:23.377 --> 02:26.378
Go to the safe house
and wait for me there, okay?

02:26.380 --> 02:28.180
Right now, just hang up
the phone and go.

02:28.182 --> 02:29.748
Why?
Just hang up
the phone and go!

02:29.750 --> 02:31.150
Huck...

02:31.152 --> 02:32.584
If she's alive,
command is coming for her.

02:32.586 --> 02:34.253
Hang up the phone and go!

02:34.255 --> 02:37.222
(whimpering)
(whispers) I need to run.

02:38.892 --> 02:41.293
(tarp rustles)
so...

02:41.295 --> 02:42.361
It looks like
you're gonna need

02:42.363 --> 02:43.929
To wait here
for me for a while.

02:43.931 --> 02:45.497
Can you do that?
Uh-huh.

02:45.499 --> 02:46.632
Oh, it's a shame,

02:46.634 --> 02:49.168
Because I was really
looking forward

02:49.170 --> 02:50.202
To getting started.

02:50.204 --> 02:51.336
But liv needs me.

02:51.338 --> 02:54.173
(breathing heavily)

02:54.175 --> 02:55.874
(sighs) you know what?

02:55.876 --> 02:57.442
What the hell?

02:57.444 --> 03:00.112
I think we have time
for at least one.
Unh-unh.

03:00.114 --> 03:03.849
(whispers)
let's live a little.
(whimpers)

03:03.851 --> 03:08.220
What's that stupid thing
the kids are saying?

03:08.222 --> 03:10.222
"y.O.L.O."?

03:10.224 --> 03:11.857
Y.O.L.O., quinn.

03:11.859 --> 03:13.392
(screaming)

03:13.394 --> 03:19.531
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

03:19.533 --> 03:21.366
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

03:21.368 --> 03:24.336
You're on the ballot
in every state. Presto.

03:24.338 --> 03:25.904
Sign these, and you resign
the vice presidency.

03:25.906 --> 03:29.508
Before the white house
can utter the word "traitor."

03:29.510 --> 03:31.510
In two weeks, you will be

03:31.512 --> 03:32.844
The phoenix
rising from the ashes

03:32.846 --> 03:34.479
Of the grant presidency.

03:34.481 --> 03:35.647
Hold on.

03:35.649 --> 03:37.816
There's something I need
from you first--

03:37.818 --> 03:39.518
Your pledge of allegiance.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.320
To the flag?
To me.

03:41.322 --> 03:43.222
Christian conservatives
got you on the ballot,

03:43.224 --> 03:45.624
They will get you a podium
on the debate stage,

03:45.626 --> 03:48.260
And then,
you will abandon them.

03:48.262 --> 03:49.861
(laughs) what?
I could never--

03:49.863 --> 03:56.868
You <i>will</i> become pro-choice
or... You won't win.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.537
That is not--

03:58.539 --> 03:59.871
Then I'm afraid I cannot
make you the first female

03:59.873 --> 04:01.406
President of
the United States of america.

04:01.408 --> 04:03.375
I can shift other stances--
gay rights, education--

04:03.377 --> 04:07.913
There's no point to any of this
unless you become pro-choice.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.314
You cannot win women.

04:09.316 --> 04:10.816
And so you will
lose, lose, lose,

04:10.818 --> 04:12.851
Unless you
drop your allegiance to jesus,

04:12.853 --> 04:14.653
And pledge it to politics.

04:14.655 --> 04:16.989
Otherwise,
there's zero point. Zero.

04:16.991 --> 04:19.591
Do you have any idea
what you are asking me to do?

04:19.593 --> 04:20.659
I am asking you
to abandon your beliefs

04:20.661 --> 04:23.795
You are asking me to choose
my career over the lives

04:23.797 --> 04:25.297
Of innocent--
actually, it only sounds
like I'm asking

04:25.299 --> 04:26.965
'cause I'm pretending
like you have a choice.

04:26.967 --> 04:29.268
You <i>cannot</i> win unless
you abandon your beliefs.

04:29.270 --> 04:30.836
Oh!
So it's a simple
yes or no.

04:30.838 --> 04:31.937
Can you do it?

04:35.742 --> 04:36.875
Yes.

04:36.877 --> 04:39.311
Loud and proud,
I need to hear it.

04:39.313 --> 04:40.479
What is your stance
on abortion?

04:40.481 --> 04:42.848
I'm--I'm--

04:42.850 --> 04:44.750
No hesitation!
Full allegiance.

04:44.752 --> 04:46.818
Listen to me, damn it.
Politics over god.
What is your stance?

04:46.820 --> 04:48.620
I'm pro-choice. I--
and why did you change?

04:48.622 --> 04:50.289
After consulting
my pastor--
no!

04:50.291 --> 04:51.757
After searching
my conscience,

04:51.759 --> 04:54.726
I decided--I now believe
that these decisions

04:54.728 --> 04:57.496
Should be between a woman
and her doctor,

04:57.498 --> 05:00.032
That I have no right
to stand in the way of that...

05:00.034 --> 05:01.600
Choice--
of that relationship.

05:01.602 --> 05:03.635
Better! It's good, even.

05:08.708 --> 05:10.509
Exciting times,
president langston.

05:10.511 --> 05:13.412
Exciting times.

05:14.847 --> 05:16.581
(door closes)

05:18.051 --> 05:19.985
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

05:19.987 --> 05:23.822
(typing)

05:23.824 --> 05:25.457
You're not going to sleep?

05:25.459 --> 05:26.958
I can't sleep right now.

05:26.960 --> 05:30.862
Why not, honey?

05:30.864 --> 05:33.932
Daniel douglas.

05:33.934 --> 05:35.867
You mean your article?

05:35.869 --> 05:37.536
I'm still wired
from the interview.

05:37.538 --> 05:41.807
That daniel douglas...
(scoffs) got him to go <i>deep.</i>

05:41.809 --> 05:46.044
(typing)

05:46.046 --> 05:48.647
(typing stops)
is there something
you wanna ask me?

05:49.882 --> 05:53.852
Is there something you
wanna tell me?

05:58.925 --> 06:01.693
Don't stay up too late,
okay?

06:01.695 --> 06:03.128
I won't.

06:05.832 --> 06:09.768
(typing resumes)

06:09.770 --> 06:13.071
<i>(michael jackson's "ben"</i>
<i>playing)</i>

06:13.073 --> 06:15.874
<i>¶ ben, the two of us</i>

06:15.876 --> 06:17.442
<i>¶ need look no more</i>

06:17.444 --> 06:19.111

06:19.113 --> 06:20.645

06:20.647 --> 06:23.081
<i>¶ we both found</i>
<i>what we were... ¶</i>

06:23.083 --> 06:26.118
Olivia!

06:26.120 --> 06:29.020
Hey, I'm leaving.

06:29.022 --> 06:33.425
I'll call you and daddy
from heathrow when I land, okay?

06:33.427 --> 06:34.593
It's only
for a couple of days.

06:34.595 --> 06:35.994
Just until
my boss gets settled.

06:35.996 --> 06:38.397
(shoe thuds)
and...

06:38.399 --> 06:41.600
I left casseroles
in the freezer.

06:41.602 --> 06:42.901
<i>¶ in me</i>

06:42.903 --> 06:43.835
<i>¶ you've got a friend...</i>

06:43.837 --> 06:46.104
I love you, olivia.

06:48.441 --> 06:50.409
That woman's liv's mother?
(jake) yes.

06:50.411 --> 06:53.178
That woman's liv's mother
who died in a plane crash?
Yes.

06:53.180 --> 06:55.881
(whispers) liv's mother
who's been <i>dead</i> for 22 years?

06:55.883 --> 06:56.982
Stop it.
You're not helping.

06:56.984 --> 06:58.083
Helping? Helping?
Help--right.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.551
Okay, we're done.
We've had it.

06:59.553 --> 07:00.852
Ever since you two
went spy-bro on us,

07:00.854 --> 07:01.987
You've been keeping us
out of the loop,

07:01.989 --> 07:04.189
You can't show up
with dead mama pope,

07:04.191 --> 07:05.724
And expect us
to fall in line.

07:05.726 --> 07:07.025
What the hell's going on?
What did you two do?

07:07.027 --> 07:08.527
It's not us.
We didn't do this.

07:08.529 --> 07:09.895
We don't know any more
than you do at this point.

07:09.897 --> 07:10.962
Then where has she been
all this time?

07:10.964 --> 07:12.130
Where've you
been all this time?

07:12.132 --> 07:13.465
Abby--
no, I want some answers.

07:13.467 --> 07:14.499
Look at liv. Look at her.

07:14.501 --> 07:17.002
Because for 22 years,
she thought her mother was dead,

07:17.004 --> 07:20.005
Where were you?
(huck) this is not the time.

07:20.007 --> 07:21.673
I found out the truth
of what my husband

07:21.675 --> 07:22.974
Does for a living.

07:22.976 --> 07:24.709
I married a man and found out
he was a monster.

07:24.711 --> 07:25.844
I stole some files.

07:25.846 --> 07:28.847
I was gonna blow the whistle
on the whole thing,

07:28.849 --> 07:31.683
Take livvie and run.
But eli caught me,

07:31.685 --> 07:33.985
And then he locked me up
in a prison.

07:33.987 --> 07:35.220
For 22 years?

07:35.222 --> 07:37.088
Yes, for 22 years.

07:37.090 --> 07:38.690
Under a fake name.

07:38.692 --> 07:39.858
Omar... Something.

07:39.860 --> 07:41.793
Omar dresden.
Omar dresden.

07:41.795 --> 07:43.695
He kept me there.

07:43.697 --> 07:45.063
Couple of days ago,
he pulled me out,

07:45.065 --> 07:47.799
Took me to some warehouse,
said he was moving me

07:47.801 --> 07:50.035
Out of the country,
but I escaped. I escaped.

07:50.037 --> 07:51.703
You escaped?
Yes.

07:51.705 --> 07:58.109
(harrison) jake! Huck! Huck!
What are you doing? No!
(maya) let me go!
What's happening?

07:58.111 --> 07:59.845
You have a tracking chip
in you somewhere.

07:59.847 --> 08:01.012
They're tracking you!
Got it!

08:01.014 --> 08:03.882
We have to get it out
and move!

08:03.884 --> 08:05.684
We gotta move!
(screaming)

08:05.686 --> 08:07.052
(yelps) aah!

08:09.889 --> 08:13.625
(beeping)

08:19.765 --> 08:21.933
(man) all clear.
They're gone.

08:25.638 --> 08:30.041
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

08:35.214 --> 08:37.682
I want operatives
at every airport terminal,

08:37.684 --> 08:39.117
Train station, bus depot,
and metro stop

08:39.119 --> 08:40.585
On the east coast.

08:40.587 --> 08:42.053
Scan the highway cams.

08:42.055 --> 08:43.922
If they used the interstates,
I want their license plates

08:43.924 --> 08:45.790
Tagged the second
that they hit the asphalt.

08:45.792 --> 08:48.093
Also, tap into the city's
red light camera network.

08:48.095 --> 08:50.762
Upload our qr6 facial
recognition software.

08:50.764 --> 08:51.763
(jake) glare gel?

08:51.765 --> 08:52.964
Messes with traffic cams.

08:52.966 --> 08:56.568
(jake) burners.
(rowan) they'll be using
burner phones.

08:56.570 --> 08:58.870
Makes it harder
but watch for clusters.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.772
Hunt them down.

09:00.774 --> 09:02.007
(abby) what about venezuela?

09:02.009 --> 09:03.742
(jake) nah. B613 pretty much
runs venezuela.

09:03.744 --> 09:05.810
They use the anti-american
jargon to attract the haters--

09:05.812 --> 09:06.878
(huck)
and then they kill them.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.280
We need a full dictatorship.

09:08.282 --> 09:09.915
Yeah, free societies
are too tough to control.

09:09.917 --> 09:11.116
They're not
as bribe-friendly.

09:11.118 --> 09:12.317
(harrison) what about iran?
North korea?

09:12.319 --> 09:15.120
Hong kong.

09:15.122 --> 09:17.155
We're putting her on
the first flight to hong kong

09:17.157 --> 09:18.857
As soon as the passport
is secured.

09:18.859 --> 09:20.859
Harrison, where are we
on that?
Got the pics.

09:20.861 --> 09:22.027
Meeting my friend
in an hour.

09:22.029 --> 09:23.161
(abby) where's quinn?

09:23.163 --> 09:24.229
Quinn's doing what she
needs to do.

09:24.231 --> 09:25.864
I should, uh,
go check on her.

09:25.866 --> 09:27.866
No, I want you here tonight.

09:27.868 --> 09:29.167
Please.

09:33.072 --> 09:38.910
(breathing heavily)

09:45.151 --> 09:46.184
(projector and camera shutter
clicks)

09:46.186 --> 09:49.854
Everything we had up
on the board? Gone.

09:49.856 --> 09:52.591
You think liv's dad
did this?
Who else could have?

09:52.593 --> 09:55.794
Would've had a full-on nervous
breakdown by now.
She's handling it.

09:55.796 --> 09:58.763
You don't handle
your own mother.
Nice digs.

09:58.765 --> 09:59.764
I thought you'd have done
a little better

09:59.766 --> 10:00.865
For yourself by now.

10:00.867 --> 10:02.133
Straight life.
You know how it is.

10:02.135 --> 10:03.134
Can't say that I do.

10:03.136 --> 10:04.769
Full I.D. Work-up?
The works.

10:04.771 --> 10:06.037
When do you need it by?
Yesterday.

10:06.039 --> 10:08.707
For you,
I will do my best.

10:08.709 --> 10:11.042
Hmm.

10:11.044 --> 10:12.677
I'm abby.

10:12.679 --> 10:16.047
Oh. (chuckles)
I almost forgot.

10:16.049 --> 10:17.916
Adnan salif says hello.

10:17.918 --> 10:20.318
Adnan salif's back?
Back here?

10:20.320 --> 10:22.087
Keep your phone on, h.

10:22.089 --> 10:24.289
I'll be in touch
in a few hours.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.791
(footsteps retreat)

10:26.793 --> 10:28.059
(door opens)

10:28.061 --> 10:30.662
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

10:34.166 --> 10:35.300
Where are we
on daniel douglas?

10:35.302 --> 10:36.635
Holding. We are holding.

10:36.637 --> 10:38.203
Did you get the photos?
Holding.

10:38.205 --> 10:40.138
Did he make a move
or not?
Holding.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.740
Cyrus!
Don't you have things to do?
Vaccines to tout?

10:41.742 --> 10:43.842
Fat kids to encourage?

10:43.844 --> 10:46.811
About the future of
my husband's presidency.

10:46.813 --> 10:48.313
My future.
I... Am... Holding.

10:48.315 --> 10:52.684
It's time to stop holding.
Play the cards already.

10:57.056 --> 10:58.189
(maya) liv.

10:58.191 --> 11:01.092
Just cleaning up a little.

11:01.094 --> 11:02.894
What you got there?

11:02.896 --> 11:06.231
I, uh...

11:06.233 --> 11:07.899
Got you some breakfast.

11:07.901 --> 11:09.067
That's so sweet of you.

11:10.136 --> 11:11.970
Here, join me.

11:11.972 --> 11:13.371
I have arrangements
to make.

11:13.373 --> 11:14.706
Make 'em later.

11:14.708 --> 11:16.107
Come on.

11:16.109 --> 11:18.043
You've been up all night
and you haven't eaten a thing.

11:18.045 --> 11:21.413
Sit, have breakfast
with your mother.

11:21.415 --> 11:22.747
Uh, I'll be outside
if you need me.

11:22.749 --> 11:24.315
Thanks, huck.

11:27.386 --> 11:31.189
(door closes)

11:32.391 --> 11:33.725
I'm good.

11:40.166 --> 11:43.101
So...

11:43.103 --> 11:46.171
Tell me about you.

11:46.173 --> 11:48.940
Uh, I-I don't, uh...

11:51.310 --> 11:52.744
There's not much to tell.

11:52.746 --> 11:56.981
I work.

11:56.983 --> 11:58.249
I have a life.

11:58.251 --> 12:00.985
I'm... (chuckles)

12:00.987 --> 12:02.353
There's not much to tell.

12:05.024 --> 12:07.192
It's funny.

12:07.194 --> 12:11.062
You start to tell yourself
stories.

12:11.064 --> 12:14.799
What you must've been up to,
the friends you're making,

12:14.801 --> 12:16.234
The boys you're falling
in love with.

12:16.236 --> 12:20.872
In my mind, you're married
to a fella named ray.

12:20.874 --> 12:21.973
A dentist--

12:21.975 --> 12:24.075
Because dentists come home
for dinner.

12:24.077 --> 12:28.146
And it was you and ray
and your son named sam.

12:28.148 --> 12:30.915
And you'd sit around
your dinner table every night,

12:30.917 --> 12:32.851
And you'd just laugh.

12:32.853 --> 12:34.753
There was lots of laughter.

12:34.755 --> 12:38.022
Love and laughter
and happiness.

12:38.024 --> 12:40.258
So now...

12:40.260 --> 12:42.160
To see who you
really are,

12:42.162 --> 12:45.263
What you've really become...

12:45.265 --> 12:49.000
Are you saying
I'm <i>not</i> happy?

12:49.002 --> 12:52.437
There just doesn't seem
to be a lot of laughter

12:52.439 --> 12:53.805
In your life.

12:53.807 --> 12:56.040
You're successful.

12:56.042 --> 13:01.079
I mean, look at these people
who work for you.

13:01.081 --> 13:05.216
The access you have,
the guns, the fake passports.

13:05.218 --> 13:06.518
I don't know.

13:06.520 --> 13:10.221
Guess I was hoping
you'd have more of me in you

13:10.223 --> 13:12.123
And less of your father.

13:12.125 --> 13:15.126
But eli raised you
in his image.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.895
Didn't he?

13:16.897 --> 13:21.432
I'm not anything
like him.

13:23.235 --> 13:28.807
Liv seems smaller, slower.
It's not like liv.

13:28.809 --> 13:31.075
How long are we gonna
do this?
Do what?

13:31.077 --> 13:34.245
Run. Hide.

13:34.247 --> 13:36.381
It doesn't matter
if we get maya

13:36.383 --> 13:38.516
To hong kong or moscow
or wherever.

13:38.518 --> 13:40.985
We both know she'll never be
out of b613's reach.

13:40.987 --> 13:44.522
Not as long as command's
still alive.

13:44.524 --> 13:46.558
He's hard to get to.

13:46.560 --> 13:51.162
Lots of agents. I'm guessing
lots of artillery, too.

13:51.164 --> 13:52.964
We'd need a--
help.

13:52.966 --> 13:55.099
Plenty of it.

13:55.101 --> 13:58.903
I think I know
where we can find it.

13:58.905 --> 14:00.238
Liv's mother is alive?

14:00.240 --> 14:01.306
For the moment.

14:01.308 --> 14:02.340
But rowan's on the hunt
for her.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.075
We need to get her
to safety,

14:04.077 --> 14:05.143
To get liv to safety.

14:05.145 --> 14:06.244
We need to take out
rowan.

14:06.246 --> 14:08.413
He's her father.

14:08.415 --> 14:10.481
I can't terminate him
without--
you need her permission?

14:10.483 --> 14:12.083
He's not <i>just</i> her father.

14:12.085 --> 14:14.018
You don't need
to educate me, jake.

14:14.020 --> 14:16.120
I should've known.

14:16.122 --> 14:18.089
What is your problem?

14:18.091 --> 14:20.091
Remington.

14:20.093 --> 14:21.159
Remington is my problem.

14:21.161 --> 14:22.393
Just for being
in the wrong place,

14:22.395 --> 14:24.262
At the wrong time,
doing my duty,

14:24.264 --> 14:26.931
Serving my country,
I get sucked into the wake

14:26.933 --> 14:28.099
Of your political destiny

14:28.101 --> 14:30.235
And end up enslaved
to b613...

14:30.237 --> 14:31.870
(whispers) to rowan...

14:31.872 --> 14:33.204
(normal voice)
for the past 22 years.

14:33.206 --> 14:35.273
Meanwhile,
you shake a few hands

14:35.275 --> 14:37.308
You say a few words,
you become governor,

14:37.310 --> 14:39.177
And then president.

14:39.179 --> 14:40.912
You didn't have my back
on that mission...

14:40.914 --> 14:42.480
(whispers) and you still don't
have it, because for you

14:42.482 --> 14:45.116
There's only two people
who matter in this world--

14:45.118 --> 14:46.885
Olivia and yourself.

14:46.887 --> 14:49.654
The rest of us?
We're just on our own.

14:49.656 --> 14:51.256
You don't think I wanna
get rid of rowan? Of b613?

14:51.258 --> 14:52.891
Of course I do.

14:52.893 --> 14:54.592
Get off your ass
and give me the assets I need.

14:54.594 --> 14:57.328
Now is not the time.
They're on guard.
Okay, flyboy.

14:57.330 --> 15:00.398
I get it. I'll take
care of this myself.
Hey!

15:00.400 --> 15:02.634
You wanna be a hero?
You wanna save the day?

15:04.203 --> 15:06.137
You wanna help me
dismantle b613?

15:06.139 --> 15:08.106
Stick around.
We'll figure out a plan.

15:08.108 --> 15:10.241
You don't want that.
You don't wanna be the hero.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.543
You wanna be <i>her</i> hero.

15:12.545 --> 15:14.212
Word to the wise?

15:14.214 --> 15:15.914
She doesn't need one.

15:15.916 --> 15:19.584
Must be nice,

15:19.586 --> 15:21.486
Letting other people
fight <i>your</i> battles.

15:28.160 --> 15:29.961
(door closes)

15:33.332 --> 15:35.400
(breathing heavily)

15:47.146 --> 15:52.016
(grunting)

15:56.722 --> 15:59.357
(glass clinks)

16:02.528 --> 16:04.162
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

16:04.164 --> 16:05.196
We're on.

16:05.198 --> 16:07.131
It's happening tomorrow.

16:07.133 --> 16:08.266
What is?

16:08.268 --> 16:10.001
Oh! <i>Ohh.</i> You mean...

16:10.003 --> 16:11.602
Leo is setting a press
conference for the morning.

16:11.604 --> 16:14.072
Now the backlash will be
swift and furious.

16:14.074 --> 16:15.239
But once people get over

16:15.241 --> 16:16.507
The idea of this
being a betrayal,

16:16.509 --> 16:17.642
They'll see it
for what it is--

16:17.644 --> 16:18.676
The sign of a true leader

16:18.678 --> 16:20.244
Willing to buck
political tides

16:20.246 --> 16:21.279
And give the country
what it needs--

16:21.281 --> 16:22.714
Its first female president.

16:22.716 --> 16:24.482
With me
as your first gentleman.

16:24.484 --> 16:25.984
I like the sound of that.

16:25.986 --> 16:28.386
(exhales)
everything we've worked for

16:28.388 --> 16:32.323
And everything we've sacrificed
has led us to this moment.

16:32.325 --> 16:33.458
So I thank you
for your patience

16:33.460 --> 16:34.559
And your discipline.

16:34.561 --> 16:36.227
For we both know,

16:36.229 --> 16:39.630
The good lord rewards those
who walk his righteous path.

16:44.169 --> 16:47.772
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

16:52.511 --> 16:53.644
James.

16:53.646 --> 16:55.446
Wh--what are you doing here?

16:55.448 --> 16:57.482
I was on my way
to meet daniel douglas.

16:57.484 --> 17:01.753
You're meeting
with daniel douglas <i>again?</i>

17:01.755 --> 17:04.455
Yeah, I'm telling you,
the man's fascinating.

17:04.457 --> 17:08.559
You didn't get everything
you needed last night?

17:08.561 --> 17:10.128
Are you kidding me?

17:10.130 --> 17:12.497
We barely scratched
the surface.

17:12.499 --> 17:14.298
(sniffs) well...

17:14.300 --> 17:17.235
Glad you boys
are having fun.

17:19.671 --> 17:21.205
Oh, I almost forgot.

17:21.207 --> 17:23.474
Danny's coming to our place
tonight, too,

17:23.476 --> 17:25.643
So we could finish up
somewhere nice and quiet.

17:25.645 --> 17:28.112
You still have that
donor dinner tonight, right?

17:28.114 --> 17:30.381
I still have
that donor dinner tonight.

17:30.383 --> 17:31.783
That's too bad.

17:31.785 --> 17:33.518
Could've been a threesome.

17:37.389 --> 17:41.092
(door opens and closes)

17:41.094 --> 17:42.460
Novak! What's happening?

17:42.462 --> 17:44.228
Oh, daniel douglas, hey.

17:44.230 --> 17:46.164
How's that article of ours
coming along?

17:46.166 --> 17:48.499
Sally and I are really
looking forward to reading.

17:48.501 --> 17:51.469
The article looks good.
Great, in fact.

17:51.471 --> 17:53.471
Yeah? You get everything
you needed?
And then some.

17:53.473 --> 17:54.539
Yeah, that's good.

17:54.541 --> 17:56.307
Hey, look...
I don't suppose

17:56.309 --> 17:57.742
There's any chance
of my getting a quick look

17:57.744 --> 17:59.210
At it before
it goes to print?

17:59.212 --> 18:02.547
Oh, there's a strict policy
that doesn't really allow

18:02.549 --> 18:04.382
For that sort of thing,
daniel. I'm--I'm sorry.

18:04.384 --> 18:08.553
(lowered voice)
I am not gay, james.

18:08.555 --> 18:11.422
I've never done anything
like that before in my life.

18:11.424 --> 18:12.423
You understand me?
Daniel--

18:12.425 --> 18:13.524
You cannot write about it!
I--

18:13.526 --> 18:15.393
You people think
we're all gay!

18:15.395 --> 18:16.461
No...

18:16.463 --> 18:17.862
We think gay people
are gay.

18:17.864 --> 18:20.465
I am a man...

18:20.467 --> 18:22.533
A christian, and I will not
accept accusations

18:22.535 --> 18:26.304
I love my wife.
I am attracted to my wife.

18:26.306 --> 18:28.506
We are steady,
and I am faithful.

18:28.508 --> 18:30.608
Yes, we all have
our moments of weakness.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.477
We all have
our crosses to bear.

18:32.479 --> 18:35.246
And mine is staying true
to the good word of the lord

18:35.248 --> 18:36.781
In the face of this--
this sickness.

18:36.783 --> 18:39.383
This <i>despicable</i> temptation.

18:39.385 --> 18:41.252
But, james...

18:41.254 --> 18:42.520
I am a man.

18:42.522 --> 18:44.322
I am not gay.

18:44.324 --> 18:47.492
Please do not embarrass
me and my family.

18:58.837 --> 19:00.204
Yeah, just a few minutes.

19:00.206 --> 19:01.606
You're gonna meet me
at the gate, right?

19:01.608 --> 19:04.642
I got everything. Yeah.
All of it.

19:04.644 --> 19:05.810
(turns up volume)
<i>¶ turn you away</i>

19:05.812 --> 19:08.312
(receiver thuds)

19:08.314 --> 19:10.348
Livvie!

19:10.350 --> 19:13.184
<i>¶ a word they say</i>
<i>¶ a word they say</i>

19:13.186 --> 19:14.452
Olivia?

19:19.758 --> 19:20.858
(door closes)

19:20.860 --> 19:22.360
The reporter.

19:22.362 --> 19:24.862
You talked to him on the phone
that morning, didn't you?

19:24.864 --> 19:26.464
Before you said
good-bye to me.

19:26.466 --> 19:28.533
I don't know. That was over
20 years ago. Why?

19:28.535 --> 19:32.470
He can corroborate your story,
call into question whatever

19:32.472 --> 19:33.738
Fake charges
dad's been keeping you

19:33.740 --> 19:35.306
Locked up under.

19:35.308 --> 19:36.541
You can stop running.

19:36.543 --> 19:37.542
And what happens
when your father

19:37.544 --> 19:40.678
How long before this poor guy
ends up in a ditch?

19:40.680 --> 19:42.380
We'll protect him.
How?

19:42.382 --> 19:44.382
We have ways.
So does your father.

19:44.384 --> 19:46.417
I'm offering you
a life above ground.

19:46.419 --> 19:48.186
And I'm telling you,
it's not worth it.

19:48.188 --> 19:50.521
Not if it means putting
someone else at risk.

19:50.523 --> 19:52.490
Enough is enough, liv.

19:52.492 --> 19:54.425
Your father refuses
to lose.

19:54.427 --> 19:57.962
As long as he's alive,
I run. I have to.

19:57.964 --> 19:59.497
And that's okay.

19:59.499 --> 20:02.633
Because now,
I've been able to see you.

20:05.904 --> 20:08.506
(jake) rowan and his team
are in there.

20:08.508 --> 20:10.241
(projector and camera shutter
clicks)

20:10.243 --> 20:13.644
Money goes into your account
the minute he's dead.

20:22.254 --> 20:25.623
(explosion)

20:33.265 --> 20:34.966
(man) no sign of them.
They're gone.

20:34.968 --> 20:36.267
It's a trap.

20:43.308 --> 20:44.508
That was freakin' awesome.

20:44.510 --> 20:47.878
If you think I enjoy killing,
you don't know me very well.

20:47.880 --> 20:51.449
Condone at times,
accept as a necessary evil,

20:51.451 --> 20:53.351
But I get no enjoyment
out of ending a life.

20:54.453 --> 20:56.754
It's time to activate
your asset--the girl.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.589
I need someone
on the inside.

20:58.591 --> 20:59.757
Yeah, I've been
calling her, boss.

20:59.759 --> 21:01.425
But none of them
have been dumb enough

21:01.427 --> 21:02.660
To keep their phone--
track her down.

21:02.662 --> 21:04.528
She's not an asset
if you can't find her.

21:07.366 --> 21:11.002
(grunting)

21:11.004 --> 21:12.436
(glass clinks)

21:12.438 --> 21:13.471
(grunts)

21:14.806 --> 21:19.043
(panting)

21:22.882 --> 21:26.984
Oh, you can't trust anyone
who's gone through wonderland.

21:26.986 --> 21:28.286
Yeah, well, I trust you.

21:28.288 --> 21:29.453
Well, you shouldn't.

21:29.455 --> 21:33.057
(sighs) tell liv
I had to go.

21:33.059 --> 21:34.458
Watch her.

21:34.460 --> 21:36.627
(footsteps descend)

21:36.629 --> 21:38.963
(groaning)

21:38.965 --> 21:42.466
(panting)

21:42.468 --> 21:45.036
(groaning)

21:45.038 --> 21:46.003
(door opens)

21:46.005 --> 21:47.071
Oh, quinn.

21:47.073 --> 21:48.506
(door closes)

21:48.508 --> 21:49.607
I told you to wait for me.

21:49.609 --> 21:52.743
(whimpering)

21:56.448 --> 21:59.517
(crying)

22:03.055 --> 22:05.923
Aah! Please, huck.

22:05.925 --> 22:07.725
Please.

22:07.727 --> 22:08.993
Shh. I'm sorry.

22:08.995 --> 22:10.594
I know how hard
this is for you.

22:10.596 --> 22:12.029
And if it was just me
you'd betrayed...

22:12.031 --> 22:14.598
But you betrayed liv.

22:14.600 --> 22:17.568
(screaming)
shh, shh, shh.

22:17.570 --> 22:18.602
Shh, shh.

22:18.604 --> 22:20.404
You remember
how this goes, right?

22:20.406 --> 22:22.740
Rip a little,
talk a little? Okay?

22:22.742 --> 22:24.008
(screaming)
shh, shh, shh.

22:24.010 --> 22:25.476
(crying)
shh, shh, shh.

22:25.478 --> 22:26.610
I tell you what.

22:26.612 --> 22:29.046
Let's go on the count
of three, okay?

22:29.048 --> 22:32.450
One... Two...

22:32.452 --> 22:33.818
Three.
(screaming)

22:33.820 --> 22:35.820
8:53 hong kong time.

22:35.822 --> 22:37.054
A client.

22:37.056 --> 22:38.122
(speaking cantonese)

22:38.124 --> 22:41.125
Thanks.

22:41.127 --> 22:45.863
(door closes)
passport, birth certificate,
driver's license.

22:45.865 --> 22:49.433
Huck just sent over
a blast from homeland security.

22:49.435 --> 22:50.901
You're kidding me.
What is it?

22:50.903 --> 22:52.670
(maya) liv?

22:52.672 --> 22:54.505
They put your name
on the fbi's most wanted list.

22:54.507 --> 22:55.806
Fake name, fake charges.

22:55.808 --> 22:56.941
Which means...
You're stuck here.

22:56.943 --> 23:00.745
There's no way you'll make it
through airport security.
Damn it.

23:00.747 --> 23:02.146
Our client hasn't done
anything wrong.

23:02.148 --> 23:03.581
And if you look into it,
I promise you,

23:03.583 --> 23:04.982
You're gonna find that
whatever's in her file

23:04.984 --> 23:07.651
Is just a bunch of trumped up
crap from 22 years ago.

23:07.653 --> 23:09.487
What's the big deal
with taking one little name

23:09.489 --> 23:10.554
Off the no-fly list?

23:10.556 --> 23:11.922
David...

23:11.924 --> 23:14.158
Normal boyfriends do favors
for their girlfriends.

23:14.160 --> 23:15.926
You know,
normal girlfriends

23:15.928 --> 23:18.095
Don't dabble in
aiding and abetting.

23:23.535 --> 23:25.102
Bad time?

23:25.104 --> 23:26.637
Sorry, sally.
Busy day.

23:26.639 --> 23:27.938
Aren't they all?

23:27.940 --> 23:30.141
This won't take long.
I do hate to be a bother.

23:30.143 --> 23:31.642
I just wanted to do you

23:31.644 --> 23:34.979
The courtesy of dropping
this off in person.

23:34.981 --> 23:36.080
What the hell is this?

23:36.082 --> 23:37.148
This is me following

23:37.150 --> 23:38.949
Your wise counsel,
mr. President.

23:38.951 --> 23:41.152
I'm running against you
as an independent.

23:41.154 --> 23:44.922
The days of you telling me
what I can and cannot do

23:44.924 --> 23:45.923
Have come to an end.

23:45.925 --> 23:49.427
What do you want?

23:49.429 --> 23:53.063
I'm sure we can work
something out.

23:53.065 --> 23:54.565
(scoffs)
are you so blind?

23:54.567 --> 23:56.200
Are you so self-involved
to notice

23:56.202 --> 23:57.835
The immeasurable destruction

23:57.837 --> 23:59.103
You've wrought
to the country?

23:59.105 --> 24:00.704
To the party?

24:00.706 --> 24:01.972
To your family?

24:01.974 --> 24:05.676
You may take me down
with you, but you can't win.

24:05.678 --> 24:06.944
You recently advised me,

24:06.946 --> 24:08.813
If I saw
a window of opportunity,

24:08.815 --> 24:10.514
Climb through it.

24:10.516 --> 24:12.917
Well, your recklessness
and your womanizing

24:12.919 --> 24:14.151
Cracked that window,

24:14.153 --> 24:16.153
And the collapse
of josie marcus

24:16.155 --> 24:17.755
Opened it wide.

24:17.757 --> 24:19.690
So what do you say now?

24:19.692 --> 24:21.859
Does that wise counsel
of yours shift

24:21.861 --> 24:23.794
In the political winds?

24:23.796 --> 24:24.929
Do not do this.

24:24.931 --> 24:27.064
We get through
this together,

24:27.066 --> 24:28.699
You're on a clear path
for the next election.

24:28.701 --> 24:31.969
Is political suicide
for both of us.

24:31.971 --> 24:35.005
I'm done waiting for someone
to open the door for me,

24:35.007 --> 24:36.474
To tell me it's my turn.

24:36.476 --> 24:38.676
You're making the biggest
mistake of your life,

24:38.678 --> 24:40.010
Crossing me.

24:40.012 --> 24:42.580
And I'll spend the rest
of <i>my</i> life

24:42.582 --> 24:46.884
Working tirelessly
to remind you of that.

24:46.886 --> 24:51.222
You <i>will</i> regret this day
forever.

24:51.224 --> 24:54.258
See you
on the battlefield.

24:58.964 --> 25:01.932
(typing)

25:01.934 --> 25:02.967
Cy?

25:02.969 --> 25:04.034
(panting)

25:04.036 --> 25:07.605
You're out of breath.
I ran up the stairs.

25:07.607 --> 25:09.707
(typing stops)
so what happened?
Where's daniel?

25:09.709 --> 25:10.841
Sally needed him home,

25:10.843 --> 25:11.909
So we just rushed
through the rest.

25:11.911 --> 25:13.277
You know,
quick and dirty.

25:13.279 --> 25:15.980
(cell phone ringing,
typing resumes)

25:15.982 --> 25:17.781
(ring)
you gonna get that?

25:17.783 --> 25:20.084
You had him our house!

25:20.086 --> 25:22.052
(ring)
with our daughter
sleeping in the next room.

25:22.054 --> 25:24.855
What?
I know, james.

25:24.857 --> 25:26.790
I know!

25:26.792 --> 25:27.825
You know what?

25:27.827 --> 25:28.926
That you had sex
with that man.

25:28.928 --> 25:30.194
You had sex with him.

25:30.196 --> 25:31.962
You had sex with him.
You had sex with him.

25:31.964 --> 25:33.063
You had sex with him.

25:33.065 --> 25:36.033
I'm confused.

25:36.035 --> 25:38.235
I thought you <i>wanted</i> me
to have sex with him?

25:38.237 --> 25:40.604
What?

25:40.606 --> 25:42.773
Or was that now how you
saw it going down?

25:42.775 --> 25:46.176
Did you expect me
to stop him? Be outraged?

25:46.178 --> 25:48.712
We should make a game plan
about what type of rent boy

25:48.714 --> 25:53.117
Is actually quite confusing
for your leading man.

25:53.119 --> 25:54.151
Now, obviously,

25:54.153 --> 25:58.255
Some backroom political crap.
But what I cannot figure out

25:58.257 --> 26:00.324
Is why you wouldn't just
hire a hooker.

26:00.326 --> 26:02.626
Why you would <i>pimp out</i>
<i>your own husband!</i>

26:02.628 --> 26:03.994
James--
I want answers, cyrus.

26:03.996 --> 26:05.563
You don't get answers.
You lost that right

26:05.565 --> 26:06.864
The minute that you took off
your pants.

26:06.866 --> 26:08.832
Oh, yeah. I did do that.
And then I took off his.

26:08.834 --> 26:10.568
Gotta admit,
that was a pleasant surprise.

26:10.570 --> 26:12.036
Shut up!
You're disgusting.
Me?

26:12.038 --> 26:13.203
You used me
like a cheap whore.

26:13.205 --> 26:16.674
That you were doing me
a favor while you did it.
Because I trusted you...

26:16.676 --> 26:18.108
You're the devil.
That you'd
honor our marriage.

26:18.110 --> 26:22.279
But instead,
you got naked.
Do you not get
what you've done here?

26:22.281 --> 26:24.081
You have ruined us, cy!

26:24.083 --> 26:25.115
You have ruined everything!

26:25.117 --> 26:28.319
That you are a gay man,
going out of his way

26:28.321 --> 26:30.854
To shame another gay man
for being in the closet.

26:30.856 --> 26:31.956
How could you?

26:31.958 --> 26:33.357
You wanna know
what I'm writing?

26:33.359 --> 26:36.327
You wanna know my angle?
It's a real page-turner, cy.

26:36.329 --> 26:40.931
(crying) I am taking our baby,
and we are leaving you.

26:40.933 --> 26:42.032
(laptop clicks)

26:42.034 --> 26:43.901
Ask for full custody,

26:43.903 --> 26:45.369
While you're at it.
I'm sure the judge

26:45.371 --> 26:46.870
Won't mind the photos.
Photos?

26:46.872 --> 26:49.607
All kinds of shots--
you doing him, him doing you.

26:49.609 --> 26:51.041
On the floor,
up against the wall,

26:51.043 --> 26:52.710
On that beautiful
leather sofa.

26:52.712 --> 26:53.811
Sally won't like that.

26:53.813 --> 26:55.245
You took photos?

26:55.247 --> 26:57.047
You think I would
go through with <i>all this</i>

26:57.049 --> 26:58.315
And not get proof?!

26:58.317 --> 27:02.786
(cell phone ringing)

27:02.788 --> 27:04.021
(ring)

27:04.023 --> 27:06.790
You're not going anywhere.
You never do.

27:06.792 --> 27:08.826
(ring)

27:08.828 --> 27:10.661
Hello, mr. President.
What do you need?

27:15.400 --> 27:18.102
You said you'd take care
of the sally situation.

27:18.104 --> 27:19.737
And I will.

27:19.739 --> 27:21.405
I-I am--I'm on it.

27:21.407 --> 27:24.108
You're too late, cy.
You missed the boat.

27:24.110 --> 27:27.378
She's leaving the ticket.
She's announcing tomorrow.

27:27.380 --> 27:31.048
I've had a lot of things
on my plate.

27:31.050 --> 27:33.217
I need you to have done
your damn job,

27:33.219 --> 27:36.153
Like you're always boasting
about, boring me senseless,

27:36.155 --> 27:38.222
Droning on about
how you do the dirty work,

27:38.224 --> 27:41.158
How you've got my back!

27:41.160 --> 27:44.161
Well, my back's now got
one hell of a sally-shiv in it,

27:44.163 --> 27:45.896
That you may as well
have handed her.

27:51.369 --> 27:53.170
(door closes)
(huffs)

27:53.172 --> 27:55.773
You happy now?

27:55.775 --> 27:57.341
Holding?

27:59.310 --> 28:00.878
Where the hell are we
on daniel douglas?

28:00.880 --> 28:02.713
What happened with james?

28:06.451 --> 28:10.287
(sobbing)

28:15.960 --> 28:18.462
I'm just
going to let you...

28:18.464 --> 28:20.064
Going to
give you a moment.

28:23.768 --> 28:25.035
(sighs)

28:33.178 --> 28:35.412
It hurts until it doesn't.

28:35.414 --> 28:37.481
You think what he did
will break you, but...

28:37.483 --> 28:38.849
It won't.

28:38.851 --> 28:40.150
You may not sleep as well
at night,

28:40.152 --> 28:42.286
But you will be fine.

28:42.288 --> 28:45.289
Numb.

28:45.291 --> 28:48.192
But... Numb and fine
are the same.

28:54.833 --> 28:59.269
Sally langston is a weed
in our garden, cyrus.

28:59.271 --> 29:00.804
(exhales)

29:00.806 --> 29:02.139
See it through.

29:11.182 --> 29:13.050
(door closes)

29:15.420 --> 29:17.321
(lock clicks)
picked a bad day
to call in sick, robin.

29:17.323 --> 29:18.455
Better have
a damn good excuse.

29:18.457 --> 29:20.157
(whimpers)

29:20.159 --> 29:21.425
Yeah, that works.

29:24.095 --> 29:25.262
I had a friend at the fbi

29:25.264 --> 29:26.897
Access your client's
security file,

29:26.899 --> 29:28.799
But even that small breach
alerted his bosses.

29:28.801 --> 29:30.033
So actually taking her name
off the list?

29:30.035 --> 29:31.502
Would set off alarms

29:31.504 --> 29:33.237
Throughout all
of homeland security.

29:33.239 --> 29:34.805
I'm sorry.

29:34.807 --> 29:37.107
There's nothing--
I mean nothing--I can do.

29:37.109 --> 29:38.442
You couldn't tell me
that over the phone?

29:38.444 --> 29:40.043
I'm your boyfriend.
I wanted to see you.

29:40.045 --> 29:41.945
Normal boyfriends drop by.

29:43.181 --> 29:44.314
I'll call you later.

29:49.187 --> 29:51.288
No go.

29:53.291 --> 29:55.292
He always wins, baby.

29:55.294 --> 29:56.460
(chuckles)

29:56.462 --> 29:59.396
We'll find another way.
This is what I do.

29:59.398 --> 30:01.465
It's what I'm good at.

30:02.500 --> 30:03.801
(door opens)

30:07.071 --> 30:10.274
Liv? You okay?
(closes door)

30:10.276 --> 30:12.876
Liv?

30:15.847 --> 30:18.582
(gate creaks)

30:18.584 --> 30:20.117
I'm trying to figure out
how to even begin to explain

30:20.119 --> 30:23.487
To you what's happening,
and I just...

30:23.489 --> 30:25.889
I don't...
Your mother's alive.
I know.

30:28.526 --> 30:32.262
Who--
jake.

30:32.264 --> 30:35.599
Jake.
He wanted to help you,
as do I.

30:35.601 --> 30:37.100
Tell me,
what can I do?

30:37.102 --> 30:38.969
I don't know that there's
anything you can do.

30:38.971 --> 30:40.604
I believe I have
a bit of power, liv.

30:40.606 --> 30:43.440
No. It's...

30:43.442 --> 30:46.610
My father put her
on the no-fly list

30:46.612 --> 30:48.078
Under an alias.

30:48.080 --> 30:50.480
They're crimes against
the republic.

30:50.482 --> 30:52.416
So if you were to talk
to anyone or do anything,

30:52.418 --> 30:54.618
You'd set off alarms
across all three branches.

30:54.620 --> 30:56.920
And if it ever got out
that you helped a criminal

30:56.922 --> 30:58.522
Escape the country,
you'd end up in prison,

30:58.524 --> 31:00.624
A traitor. And so would she.
My father would win.

31:00.626 --> 31:03.026
Power works against you.
So I...

31:03.028 --> 31:05.429
I'm not calling you
to ask for help.

31:05.431 --> 31:07.898
You're calling me to say
you don't know what to do.

31:12.270 --> 31:13.370
Liv...

31:16.207 --> 31:17.908
Olivia.

31:17.910 --> 31:20.911
(sighs)

31:20.913 --> 31:22.512
I just wanted
to hear your voice

31:22.514 --> 31:27.217
And talk about jam.

31:27.219 --> 31:32.623
(chuckles) and vermont.

31:32.625 --> 31:34.057
And kids.

31:37.428 --> 31:41.365
And...

31:41.367 --> 31:45.102
I just needed...

31:45.104 --> 31:48.238
I just needed one minute.

31:48.240 --> 31:49.573
(chuckles)

31:49.575 --> 31:52.542
But I'm okay...

31:52.544 --> 31:54.144
Now, so...

31:56.447 --> 31:57.981
I'm taking care of
your mother.

31:57.983 --> 32:00.617
No. You can't.

32:00.619 --> 32:02.586
It's done.
I'm taking care of it.

32:02.588 --> 32:05.088
What is it you say?
Consider it handled.

32:05.090 --> 32:07.157
Fitz--
I'm not asking you.

32:07.159 --> 32:08.225
I'm telling you.

32:13.031 --> 32:14.498
(voice breaking)
thank you.

32:14.500 --> 32:18.135
Thank you.

32:18.137 --> 32:19.403
I love you.

32:19.405 --> 32:21.338
(laughs)

32:21.340 --> 32:25.509
Hang up.
I have things to do.

32:25.511 --> 32:28.412
(laughs)

32:37.622 --> 32:40.123
(presses button)

32:40.125 --> 32:42.592
I need general sharp
at the pentagon.

32:47.332 --> 32:50.300
(breathing heavily)

32:50.302 --> 32:52.035
Here.

32:52.037 --> 32:54.004
Drink.

32:56.307 --> 32:57.474
Mm.

32:57.476 --> 32:59.343
It's straight vodka.
Drink it.

32:59.345 --> 33:00.610
Swish it around your mouth
a little bit.

33:00.612 --> 33:03.380
From huck's little
dental adventure.

33:03.382 --> 33:04.548
Also numb the pain.

33:04.550 --> 33:06.516
Mm.

33:06.518 --> 33:08.085
Ugh.

33:08.087 --> 33:10.320
(clears throat)

33:14.492 --> 33:17.661
Are you gonna cry?
Damn it.
(crying)

33:17.663 --> 33:19.029
No, no, there's no--
that's--

33:19.031 --> 33:20.030
That's--that's against
the rules.

33:20.032 --> 33:21.164
Crying?

33:21.166 --> 33:23.166
For god sakes.

33:23.168 --> 33:24.668
Seriously,
suck it back in.

33:24.670 --> 33:26.069
Now you wanna be a big dog?

33:26.071 --> 33:28.739
Big dogs get bit.
Huck did you a favor.

33:28.741 --> 33:30.374
You still have all
your fingers and toes.

33:30.376 --> 33:34.044
No drill holes anywhere.
A few teeth are nothin'.

33:34.046 --> 33:35.712
So you don't
eat steak anymore.

33:35.714 --> 33:38.582
Stop... Crying!

33:38.584 --> 33:40.584
(gasps)

33:40.586 --> 33:44.721
Huck was the only
person I had,

33:44.723 --> 33:47.691
And he hurt me.

33:47.693 --> 33:50.794
He hurt me.

33:50.796 --> 33:54.564
He hurt me.

33:54.566 --> 33:58.602
(gasps) and now
I don't have anybody.

33:58.604 --> 33:59.603
He hurt me.

33:59.605 --> 34:04.274
(crying)

34:04.276 --> 34:07.144
(whispers) you have me.

34:07.146 --> 34:10.781
You have me.

34:10.783 --> 34:13.583
Mm. Ow.
Oh. Sorry.

34:38.543 --> 34:43.680
(both moaning)

34:52.156 --> 34:53.323
Evening, sally.
Oh, I know why
you're here, cyrus.

34:53.325 --> 34:54.558
You're too late.
I'm afraid I've already

34:54.560 --> 34:56.093
Stabbed the pig
through its belly.

34:56.095 --> 34:58.228
And I'm sure if I were from
your neck of hickland,

34:58.230 --> 35:00.097
That would some semblance
of sense.

35:00.099 --> 35:01.231
(chuckles)

35:01.233 --> 35:04.668
Go ahead.

35:04.670 --> 35:06.236
Take a gander.

35:06.238 --> 35:08.472
(scoffs)
(pen thuds)

35:45.610 --> 35:49.179
You hoped this would
be your... What?

35:49.181 --> 35:52.482
Bargaining chip?

35:52.484 --> 35:54.851
Insurance?

35:54.853 --> 35:56.753
The end result of some
subversive scheme

35:56.755 --> 35:58.788
To keep me off the ballot
come November?

35:58.790 --> 36:00.724
All of the above.

36:00.726 --> 36:01.825
Please.

36:01.827 --> 36:03.260
You and I both know

36:03.262 --> 36:06.396
That you will never release
these pictures.

36:06.398 --> 36:07.597
Destroy your husband,

36:07.599 --> 36:09.366
Your marriage,

36:09.368 --> 36:11.168
Along with whatever
immoral future

36:11.170 --> 36:12.536
The two of you may
have hoped to have together?

36:12.538 --> 36:14.304
Not to mention,
did you honestly think

36:14.306 --> 36:16.306
That the party was prepared
to bear the cross

36:16.308 --> 36:18.241
Of the president's
chief of staff's husband

36:18.243 --> 36:20.410
Having relations
with a married man?

36:20.412 --> 36:22.379
I don't think so.

36:22.381 --> 36:25.415
This plan of yours
backfired.

36:25.417 --> 36:27.384
You've lost.

36:27.386 --> 36:29.519
Your empty threats,
your attempts at intimidation,

36:29.521 --> 36:33.423
None of it is going
to work this time.

36:35.459 --> 36:39.396
And the saying about the pig
means it's over, cyrus.

36:47.805 --> 36:51.675
(door opens and slams)

36:56.514 --> 36:58.281
(cell phone ringing)

36:58.283 --> 36:59.883
(ring)
(sighs)

36:59.885 --> 37:01.818
(ring)

37:01.820 --> 37:04.421
(ring)

37:04.423 --> 37:07.224
(ring)

37:07.226 --> 37:09.459
(ring)

37:09.461 --> 37:10.527
What?

37:10.529 --> 37:12.329
I'm sorry.

37:12.331 --> 37:16.266
I did a...
A horrible thing.

37:16.268 --> 37:18.001
And I'm so s--

37:18.003 --> 37:20.670
I'm so sorry.

37:20.672 --> 37:22.339
And I just want you
to know--

37:22.341 --> 37:24.741
I'm not going to use
the photos.

37:24.743 --> 37:27.277
Sally will never see them.
No one will ever see them.

37:27.279 --> 37:30.714
They're burned.
Consider them burned.

37:34.385 --> 37:36.886
Can you forgive me?

37:41.292 --> 37:43.426
Just tell him what you want,
make the trade.

37:43.428 --> 37:44.294
As long as you can
really get

37:44.296 --> 37:45.395
What you say you can.

37:45.397 --> 37:46.596
Huck's pretty good
at hiding people.

37:46.598 --> 37:50.033
I can track the coordinates,
triangulate a signal.

37:50.035 --> 37:51.301
Then we just go
door to door,

37:51.303 --> 37:53.403
Smoke 'em out,
take 'em in, done.

37:53.405 --> 37:54.804
You are seriously
the best girlfriend

37:54.806 --> 37:57.440
I've ever had.

38:09.453 --> 38:10.587
It's a military plane,

38:10.589 --> 38:12.055
Will fly you directly
to hong kong.

38:12.057 --> 38:13.590
I still have to go through
customs, though, right?

38:13.592 --> 38:14.891
Once I get there?

38:14.893 --> 38:16.626
I have a friend who's helping
us skirt that.

38:16.628 --> 38:17.927
Fancy friend.

38:17.929 --> 38:19.763
You have a phone.

38:19.765 --> 38:20.964
Remember,
if anything goes wrong,

38:20.966 --> 38:24.301
Call the number I gave you.
You also have a gun.

38:24.303 --> 38:25.435
I hope you won't need
to use it,

38:25.437 --> 38:30.907
Okay, liv, we can't wait
any longer. She needs to go.

38:30.909 --> 38:32.309
Okay.

38:32.311 --> 38:34.377
I guess this is good-bye.

38:38.549 --> 38:41.818
I'll keep working
until you're safe, I promise.

38:44.355 --> 38:45.955
Okay, no,
this is not a good-bye.

38:45.957 --> 38:47.791
For a client? Sure.
Throw 'em on a plane

38:47.793 --> 38:48.825
And wish 'em the best.

38:48.827 --> 38:51.328
And you've been keeping her
at arm's length

38:51.330 --> 38:54.864
She's leaving. So you go
and you hug her right now.

38:54.866 --> 38:57.801
In case you
never get to again.

38:57.803 --> 38:58.935
Liv!

38:58.937 --> 39:02.005
("ben" playing)

39:02.007 --> 39:04.341
Mom!

39:04.343 --> 39:06.910
¶ ben, the two of us

39:06.912 --> 39:11.648
¶ need look no more

39:11.650 --> 39:15.852
¶ we both found what we were
looking for ¶

39:15.854 --> 39:20.390
(voice breaks)
I love you, olivia.

39:20.392 --> 39:23.993
¶ with a friend to call my own

39:23.995 --> 39:25.595
I love you, olivia.

39:25.597 --> 39:27.130
I know.

39:27.132 --> 39:29.933
¶ and you, my friend, will see

39:29.935 --> 39:33.970
¶ you've got a friend in me

39:33.972 --> 39:36.773
¶ you've got a friend
in me ¶

39:39.410 --> 39:44.114
¶ ben, you're always running
here and there ¶

39:44.116 --> 39:46.015
¶ here and there

39:46.017 --> 39:48.418
(door closes)
(telephone ringing)

39:48.420 --> 39:51.454
¶ you're not wanted anywhere

39:51.456 --> 39:52.689
¶ anywhere

39:52.691 --> 39:54.791
(ring)

39:54.793 --> 39:57.827
Hello?
(man) marie?

39:57.829 --> 40:01.131
<i>Who?</i>
<i>Uh, hi. I'm looking</i>
<i>for marie--your mom.</i>

40:01.133 --> 40:02.499
<i>Is she there?</i>

40:02.501 --> 40:05.702
My mom's name is maya.
She's not here.

40:05.704 --> 40:06.836
(receiver thuds)

40:06.838 --> 40:08.538
¶ to go

40:08.540 --> 40:12.675
¶ you've got a place
to go ¶

40:12.677 --> 40:14.144
(jet engines roaring)

40:14.146 --> 40:18.948
¶ ben, most people would
turn you away ¶

40:18.950 --> 40:21.684
¶ turn you away

40:21.686 --> 40:25.088
¶ I don't listen to
a word they say ¶

40:25.090 --> 40:26.823
What was her name
on the no-fly list?

40:26.825 --> 40:28.191
What?
Her name.

40:28.193 --> 40:30.126
The name my father invented,
the name of the woman

40:30.128 --> 40:31.795
Who did all those things.

40:31.797 --> 40:33.530
The name of
the wanted terrorist.

40:33.532 --> 40:36.032
(typing)

40:36.034 --> 40:38.735
Uh, marie.
Marie wallace.

40:38.737 --> 40:40.103
What is it, liv?

40:40.105 --> 40:43.473
My father was trying
to protect me this whole time.

40:43.475 --> 40:46.609
He didn't want me to know
what she did, who she is.

40:46.611 --> 40:47.777
Liv...

40:47.779 --> 40:50.447
¶ like ben

40:50.449 --> 40:53.116
He's not the monster.

40:53.118 --> 40:54.451
<i>She</i> is.

40:54.453 --> 40:56.920
(types)

40:56.922 --> 41:00.557
Then we've got a problem.

41:00.559 --> 41:03.526
One... Two... Three...

41:03.528 --> 41:05.228
Okay, okay, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

41:05.230 --> 41:07.497
I know what I can do.
I know how to make it right.

41:07.499 --> 41:08.698
Just wait, huck.
Just wait.

41:08.700 --> 41:09.966
What's our deal, quinn?

41:09.968 --> 41:12.168
Rip a little,
talk a little.
Talk a little.

41:12.170 --> 41:14.971
Every time I give you
something--something good,

41:14.973 --> 41:16.206
I get to keep a tooth.

41:16.208 --> 41:17.574
Do you have something good
to give me now?

41:17.576 --> 41:19.108
Because I was about
to take a bicuspid...

41:19.110 --> 41:21.611
(groans)
and those are important
for dental health

41:21.613 --> 41:22.612
And for eating.

41:22.614 --> 41:24.981
I don't have something
right now.

41:24.983 --> 41:26.483
No, but I have better!

41:26.485 --> 41:27.984
What's better
than giving me something?

41:27.986 --> 41:31.254
Doing something!

41:31.256 --> 41:33.189
I want the tape.

41:33.191 --> 41:36.226
Of me and the security guard.
Every copy.

41:36.228 --> 41:41.264
Before I give you anything,
I get the tape.

41:44.635 --> 41:46.269
(laughing)

41:46.271 --> 41:49.038
What's funny?

41:49.040 --> 41:52.976
My daughter taught you well.

42:06.624 --> 42:09.792
(cell phone ringing)

42:09.794 --> 42:13.196
(ring)

42:13.198 --> 42:14.797
(ring)

42:14.799 --> 42:17.133
(clicking)

42:17.135 --> 42:18.134
Hello?

42:18.136 --> 42:21.070
(whispers) cyrus?

42:21.072 --> 42:24.040
I have committed a sin.
