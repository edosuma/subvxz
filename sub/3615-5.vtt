00:01.918 --> 00:04.959
(<i>rock music playing</i>)

00:07.999 --> 00:09.567
Abbey, maybe you should get Sean

00:09.667 --> 00:11.083
another drink.

00:11.999 --> 00:12.818
ABBEY:
Okay.

00:12.918 --> 00:14.359
But that's over the club limit.

00:14.459 --> 00:15.234
Yeah, it's okay.

00:15.334 --> 00:17.292
I'll get him a cab home.

00:18.125 --> 00:19.484
Prue still hasn't called?

00:19.584 --> 00:20.192
Nope.

00:20.292 --> 00:21.651
Look at that poor guy.

00:21.751 --> 00:23.484
PIPER:
You think she stood him up?

00:23.584 --> 00:24.899
Not deliberately.
I just think

00:24.999 --> 00:27.776
that since we've been back
from Pilgrim times,

00:27.876 --> 00:29.692
she's been on a demon bender.

00:29.792 --> 00:30.037
You think?

00:30.047 --> 00:32.651
You mean, because that's all
she ever talks about?

00:32.750 --> 00:34.609
Yeah, well, how are we gonna

00:34.709 --> 00:36.484
explain this
to him?

00:36.584 --> 00:37.526
(<i>sighs</i>)
Abbey?

00:37.626 --> 00:40.899
You better make
that a double.

00:40.999 --> 00:42.651
I'm gonna call Prue.

00:42.751 --> 00:44.442
Well, speaking
of a big chill,

00:44.542 --> 00:46.651
is Leo keeping you warm?

00:46.751 --> 00:47.609
Nope.

00:47.709 --> 00:51.734
Honey, are you still afraid
that they're watching you?

00:51.834 --> 00:52.317
(<i>chuckles</i>)

00:52.417 --> 00:54.025
Well, what am I supposed
to think?

00:54.125 --> 00:56.317
The last two times they orbed
him out

00:56.417 --> 00:59.899
was right in the middle
of... it.

00:59.999 --> 01:00.983
So what does he say?

01:01.083 --> 01:01.609
He swears

01:01.709 --> 01:02.899
they're not watching.

01:02.999 --> 01:05.483
But h-he's a guy;
he'll say anything.

01:05.584 --> 01:07.900
The point is
is that I think
they're watching,

01:08.000 --> 01:09.899
and when I think,
I can't, I can't,

01:09.999 --> 01:11.567
I can't concentrate.
Hmm.

01:11.667 --> 01:15.275
Well, at least you have
the option <i>to</i> concentrate.

01:15.375 --> 01:17.025
If Cole and I continue

01:17.125 --> 01:18.234
this flirting tango thing,

01:18.334 --> 01:21.192
I'm gonna have to start
concentrating on myself.

01:21.292 --> 01:23.484
PRUE (<i>over phone</i>):
Hello?
Prue?

01:23.584 --> 01:25.275
Hey, where are you?

01:25.375 --> 01:26.037
Hey. On my way home from work.

01:26.047 --> 01:29.025
Hey, you will never guess
what I found on the Internet.

01:29.125 --> 01:29.899
Remember Micah?

01:29.999 --> 01:32.317
The 17th-century hottie?

01:32.417 --> 01:33.567
Wow, it's hard to forget.

01:33.667 --> 01:35.401
Okay, enough about the past.
Tell her

01:35.501 --> 01:36.275
about the present.

01:36.375 --> 01:38.526
Well, I traced his ancestors
and found

01:38.626 --> 01:41.317
an entire history of the village
that we visited.

01:41.417 --> 01:43.651
I figure it might give us a clue

01:43.751 --> 01:46.899
to the identity of the demon
that the Triad sent to kill us.

01:46.999 --> 01:47.692
Prue, honey,

01:47.792 --> 01:48.900
aren't you forgetting something?

01:49.000 --> 01:51.900
No, my photo shoot's
not till tomorrow.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.899
No, I mean something else.

01:53.999 --> 01:54.900
Like, uh,

01:55.000 --> 01:56.192
your date?

01:56.292 --> 01:58.692
Oh, oh! Sean. Oh!

01:58.792 --> 02:02.275
All right, uh,
just give him a drink.

02:02.375 --> 02:03.037
If we give him any more,

02:03.047 --> 02:04.484
we're gonna have
to send him

02:04.584 --> 02:05.275
to an AA meeting.

02:05.375 --> 02:06.120
How long has he been there?

02:06.130 --> 02:09.401
I'd say about an hour
and 327 peanuts.

02:09.501 --> 02:10.900
All right, so what do I do?

02:11.000 --> 02:13.899
Well, remorse is good,
and attendance is better.

02:13.999 --> 02:14.818
Well, Piper,

02:14.918 --> 02:15.900
I'm halfway across town.

02:16.000 --> 02:16.899
Besides, I gotta go home

02:16.999 --> 02:19.234
and, and look up
all this demon stuff.

02:19.334 --> 02:20.359
Well, can't it wait?

02:20.459 --> 02:21.734
What, and you think
the Triad will?

02:21.834 --> 02:23.942
All right, we have to get them
before they get us.

02:24.042 --> 02:26.818
Just tell him that I got hung up
at work and that

02:26.918 --> 02:27.899
I'll make it up to him.

02:27.999 --> 02:29.109
All righty, then.

02:29.209 --> 02:30.899
Is she okay?

02:30.999 --> 02:33.317
Mm-hmm. I guess.

02:33.417 --> 02:34.942
Uh,

02:35.042 --> 02:36.109
Sean, hi.

02:36.209 --> 02:37.859
There's been a slight glitch.

02:37.959 --> 02:40.317
Uh, sometimes my sister
gets hung up at work,

02:40.417 --> 02:42.609
and she sorta has
a one-track mind.

02:42.709 --> 02:44.109
It's not a problem.
I understand.

02:44.209 --> 02:47.876
Tell her just
to give me a call.

02:49.792 --> 02:51.025
PIPER:
Not a problem.

02:51.125 --> 02:52.818
He took that well.

02:52.918 --> 02:54.192
Well, he's had three drinks.

02:54.292 --> 02:57.651
So when does "one-track" spill
over into total obsession?

02:57.751 --> 03:01.999
When you start forgetting about
guys like Sean.

03:29.999 --> 03:31.959
(<i>glass breaks</i>)

04:56.501 --> 04:57.942
Here, sweetie.

04:58.042 --> 04:59.776
Are you feeling
any better?

04:59.876 --> 05:02.359
Yeah, I think
I was more stunned
than hurt, you know?

05:02.459 --> 05:03.484
It just happened
so fast.

05:03.584 --> 05:05.692
PIPER:
It's eerie knowing
that somebody

05:05.792 --> 05:07.692
went through
every room in the house

05:07.792 --> 05:10.526
smashing mirrors,
touching who knows what.

05:10.626 --> 05:12.109
Fondling who knows what.

05:12.209 --> 05:13.192
It's just so creepy.

05:13.292 --> 05:15.899
At least nothing seems
to be missing.

05:15.999 --> 05:17.651
How do you know
it wasn't a demon?

05:17.751 --> 05:19.317
Mm, demons don't usually fondle.

05:19.417 --> 05:21.609
PIPER:
And besides, the only
demon that we know

05:21.709 --> 05:23.651
who used mirrors was Kali.
(<i>door shuts</i>)

05:23.751 --> 05:24.651
And we vanquished her sorry ass.

05:24.751 --> 05:26.899
Yeah, by smashing
her reflection
in a mirror.

05:26.999 --> 05:28.567
I mean, I know
that she's supposed

05:28.667 --> 05:30.401
to be dead, but so
were the Grimlocks.

05:30.501 --> 05:32.899
DARRYL:
Please don't remind
me about them.

05:32.999 --> 05:33.776
Did you find anything?

05:33.876 --> 05:34.899
Just a bunch
of fingerprints

05:34.999 --> 05:35.899
that don't match your samples.

05:35.999 --> 05:37.859
I'm gonna run it through
the computer,

05:37.959 --> 05:38.899
see if any names pop up.

05:38.999 --> 05:39.899
They won't.

05:39.999 --> 05:41.317
I mean, hello, guys?

05:41.417 --> 05:44.192
<i>Book of Shadows</i> 101--
mirrors;

05:44.292 --> 05:46.692
the portals through
which evil enters.

05:46.792 --> 05:47.900
Yeah, but there are fingerprints

05:48.000 --> 05:50.401
and demons don't even
usually have fingers.

05:50.501 --> 05:51.484
Well, on the human side
of things,

05:51.584 --> 05:53.567
I need you guys to put together
a grudge list

05:53.667 --> 05:54.900
of any enemies
that you have,

05:55.000 --> 05:56.899
past or present.

05:56.999 --> 05:57.899
Already done.

05:57.999 --> 05:59.275
Let's see.

05:59.375 --> 06:00.651
"Abraxas, Barbas, Yama."

06:00.751 --> 06:03.567
What did you do,
date the United Nations?

06:03.667 --> 06:05.192
Uh, it's the demons, warlocks

06:05.292 --> 06:06.983
and various
evil forces
that we faced

06:07.083 --> 06:08.401
in the last
two years.

06:08.501 --> 06:10.067
That's not exactly what I meant.

06:10.167 --> 06:13.651
Okay, um, I'm gonna go hit
<i>The Book of Shadows</i>

06:13.751 --> 06:17.401
and see if I can
find anything
about mirrors.

06:17.501 --> 06:18.899
PHOEBE:
Uh, Prue's been

06:18.999 --> 06:20.401
a little fixated lately.

06:20.501 --> 06:21.899
PIPER:
Do you think

06:21.999 --> 06:23.109
it was a human bad guy?

06:23.209 --> 06:25.692
Any other house, yeah.

06:25.792 --> 06:28.083
Around here, you never know.

06:28.834 --> 06:31.000
PRUE:
Piper? Phoebe?

06:32.334 --> 06:34.776
What? What is it?

06:34.876 --> 06:36.983
That door was unlocked.

06:37.083 --> 06:38.401
So?

06:38.501 --> 06:41.025
So ever since a demon tried
to steal <i>The Book of Shadows</i>

06:41.125 --> 06:42.899
a couple of weeks ago,
I've been locking it.

06:42.999 --> 06:46.067
You lock this door, but you
don't lock the front door?

06:46.167 --> 06:47.983
I lock the front door.

06:48.083 --> 06:49.609
Me, too... mostly.

06:49.709 --> 06:50.442
I don't. Why bother?

06:50.542 --> 06:51.983
Because you're three
young women.

06:52.083 --> 06:53.526
In fact,
your whole attitude

06:53.626 --> 06:54.734
about security
baffles me.

06:54.834 --> 06:58.609
You have no alarm system,
no-no dead bolts, no dog.

06:58.709 --> 07:01.626
Darryl, we're three witches.
I think we can handle it.

07:04.542 --> 07:06.567
(<i>sighs</i>)
It wasn't
jimmied.

07:06.667 --> 07:07.899
So what, you think
we're dealing

07:07.999 --> 07:09.234
with a lock-picking
demon, Prue?

07:09.334 --> 07:10.734
PIPER:
It doesn't
look like

07:10.834 --> 07:12.401
anything's missing
from up here either.

07:12.501 --> 07:14.899
PHOEBE:
I just think
it's ludicrous
to rule out

07:14.999 --> 07:16.359
that a human could have
done this.

07:16.459 --> 07:17.609
Yes, well, I think
it's ludicrous

07:17.709 --> 07:19.651
to think that the Triad
has got nothing

07:19.751 --> 07:20.484
to do with it.

07:20.584 --> 07:24.776
Um, Darryl, why don't you go
check on those fingerprints?

07:24.876 --> 07:27.234
We need to have
a little conference here.

07:27.334 --> 07:28.859
Okay. Good night.

07:28.959 --> 07:30.959
PHOEBE:
Night.

07:31.876 --> 07:32.567
Leo!

07:32.667 --> 07:35.609
Uh, Prue, maybe
a little perspective
here for a second.

07:35.709 --> 07:37.334
Leo!

07:38.209 --> 07:40.192
What? What is it?
What is the problem?

07:40.292 --> 07:44.192
I need to know everything
that you know about the Triad.

07:44.292 --> 07:44.818
You what?

07:44.918 --> 07:46.250
(<i>chuckles</i>)

07:46.999 --> 07:47.734
Hi.

07:47.834 --> 07:49.083
Hi.

07:51.584 --> 07:53.983
Okay, well,
this really
can't wait.

07:54.083 --> 07:55.317
You know...

07:55.417 --> 07:56.359
the Triad sent
somebody back

07:56.459 --> 07:58.192
in time and nearly wiped out
our entire line,

07:58.292 --> 08:00.234
and I am willing to bet
that it's the same demon

08:00.334 --> 08:02.025
that we found up here
a couple of weeks ago.

08:02.125 --> 08:04.899
Now, if you guys don't want
to take that seriously,

08:04.999 --> 08:05.899
that's your business.

08:05.999 --> 08:07.899
Me, I'm on a mission.

08:07.999 --> 08:08.899
Hello.

08:08.999 --> 08:11.734
We really need
to get her laid, huh?

08:11.834 --> 08:13.899
(<i>chuckles</i>)

08:13.999 --> 08:14.818
Hi.

08:14.918 --> 08:15.526
(<i>laughs</i>)

08:15.626 --> 08:18.999
(<i>giggles coyly</i>)

08:19.876 --> 08:22.818
I think I'm gonna go see
what Prue's up to.

08:22.918 --> 08:25.667
So?

08:29.999 --> 08:31.899
We grow impatient,
Balthazor.

08:31.999 --> 08:34.525
We did not expect it
to take this long.

08:34.626 --> 08:37.899
You had two years,
by their time, without success.

08:37.999 --> 08:38.899
I've had a month.

08:38.999 --> 08:40.359
A month
with two years

08:40.458 --> 08:41.734
worth of information.

08:41.833 --> 08:44.651
Information collected by
the blood of demons before you.

08:44.751 --> 08:48.484
The young one, Phoebe,
is almost within my grasp.

08:48.584 --> 08:50.192
That's not why
we summoned you.

08:50.292 --> 08:52.125
We're assigning
another.

08:54.167 --> 08:55.959
You're replacing me?

08:56.209 --> 08:58.192
We had a bargain:
I get the Charmed Ones for you,

08:58.292 --> 08:59.942
you give me back my...
The bargain is in

09:00.042 --> 09:02.442
your best interests, not ours.

09:02.542 --> 09:05.899
Don't look at it as
replacement, Balthazor.

09:05.999 --> 09:07.150
Look at it
as assistance.

09:07.250 --> 09:11.234
MEMBER 3:
However, if either of
you should be caught,

09:11.334 --> 09:11.994
the same maxims apply.

09:12.004 --> 09:15.776
We can't risk either of you
leading the Charmed Ones to us.

09:15.876 --> 09:18.067
May I know who you're sending?

09:18.167 --> 09:19.859
Sent, you mean.

09:19.959 --> 09:23.209
Troxa has already started.

09:38.918 --> 09:40.125
(<i>Piper gasps</i>)

09:47.792 --> 09:48.317
Leo?

09:48.417 --> 09:49.484
Piper.

09:49.584 --> 09:51.067
Um...

09:51.167 --> 09:52.942
we can't.

09:53.042 --> 09:54.567
Yes, we can.

09:54.667 --> 09:56.442
No, I can't.

09:56.542 --> 09:59.109
I feel like
I'm being watched.

09:59.209 --> 10:02.651
Piper, you have
to get past this.

10:02.751 --> 10:03.834
Yeah. Um...

10:04.834 --> 10:06.899
Mm... mm...

10:06.999 --> 10:09.818
Okay, um,
how about you tell them

10:09.918 --> 10:11.192
to look
the other way?

10:11.292 --> 10:12.818
They're not looking.
How many times

10:12.918 --> 10:14.859
do we have to have
this conversation?

10:14.959 --> 10:16.401
Well, how
do you know?

10:16.501 --> 10:17.150
How can you be sure?

10:17.250 --> 10:18.942
Because I told you.
That's not what they do.

10:19.042 --> 10:23.109
Okay, then how do you explain
the last two times?

10:23.209 --> 10:23.859
Count 'em. Two?

10:23.959 --> 10:26.899
Sheer coincidence,
I'm telling you.

10:26.999 --> 10:28.109
Come on, Piper.

10:28.209 --> 10:30.899
We need
to get past this.

10:30.999 --> 10:31.859
Yeah, and I need

10:31.959 --> 10:33.899
to feel like
it's just you and me

10:33.999 --> 10:36.942
and not the whole
universe watching.

10:37.042 --> 10:39.401
I'm sorry.

10:39.501 --> 10:39.859
It's okay.

10:39.959 --> 10:45.317
I, uh, I guess
I better go find
Prue some answers.

10:45.417 --> 10:47.999
Yeah.

10:53.292 --> 10:55.125
(<i>both moan</i>)

10:56.999 --> 10:59.192

10:59.292 --> 11:00.792
(<i>sighs</i>)

11:31.999 --> 11:33.334
(<i>gasps</i>)

11:39.584 --> 11:41.167
(<i>doorbell rings</i>)

11:44.042 --> 11:45.899
Cole, what are you
doing here?

11:45.999 --> 11:48.567
Are you all right?
I just heard.

11:48.667 --> 11:49.401
Heard what?

11:49.501 --> 11:51.651
COLE:
Uh, about
what happened.

11:51.751 --> 11:53.567
The... the break-in?

11:53.667 --> 11:55.484
You guys okay?

11:55.584 --> 11:57.900
You came all the way
over here for me?

11:58.000 --> 11:59.818
I mean, I mean,
for w-we?

11:59.918 --> 12:00.899
Uh...

12:00.999 --> 12:01.734
For us?

12:01.834 --> 12:03.899
Did you get a look
at who it was?

12:03.999 --> 12:05.459
No.

12:05.999 --> 12:07.401
COLE:
I'm gonna
make a call,

12:07.501 --> 12:09.776
get a patrol car
to watch the place.

12:09.876 --> 12:10.734
PRUE:
That's all right.

12:10.834 --> 12:12.692
Actually, I think
that we can handle it.

12:12.792 --> 12:13.651
No, you can't.

12:13.751 --> 12:14.401
I mean,

12:14.501 --> 12:16.025
you have no idea
what kind of evil

12:16.125 --> 12:17.401
you're dealing with here.

12:17.501 --> 12:18.078
Yes, well, we were

12:18.088 --> 12:20.899
actually just discussing
that, weren't we, Prue?

12:20.999 --> 12:23.899
PHOEBE:
Um, do you want anything, Cole?
Do you want some coffee

12:23.999 --> 12:24.484
or something?

12:24.584 --> 12:25.526
Actually, Phoebe,
that's not

12:25.626 --> 12:26.734
really a good idea.
We have

12:26.834 --> 12:27.899
something
very important

12:27.999 --> 12:29.626
that we have to discuss.

12:30.584 --> 12:31.899
That's all right.

12:31.999 --> 12:32.776
I-I really

12:32.876 --> 12:34.818
should get going, anyway.
It's late, I...

12:34.918 --> 12:36.899
um... (<i>clears throat</i>)

12:36.999 --> 12:37.900
Call me anytime.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.709
Yeah, I-I-I will.
Thanks.

12:42.999 --> 12:45.192
Okay, this better be good.

12:45.292 --> 12:46.526
Yeah, well,
I was up in the attic,

12:46.626 --> 12:47.899
and when I woke up,
there was a pillow

12:47.999 --> 12:50.776
hovering above my face
about to smother me.

12:50.876 --> 12:52.651
A pillow?

12:52.751 --> 12:53.401
Hovering.

12:53.501 --> 12:54.359
Well, that must be

12:54.459 --> 12:57.526
the infamous
pillow-smothering demon.

12:57.626 --> 12:58.484
PIPER:
Or maybe it was just

12:58.584 --> 12:59.484
a nightmare.
All right,
it wasn't

12:59.584 --> 13:01.983
a nightmare,
and it certainly wasn't a joke.

13:02.083 --> 13:02.942
There is a demon

13:03.042 --> 13:05.334
after me or us, I know it.

13:09.042 --> 13:11.292
Okay.

13:11.999 --> 13:14.899
Come out, come out
wherever you are.

13:14.999 --> 13:17.209
(<i>roaring</i>)

13:20.999 --> 13:23.401
What do you think
the Triad will say

13:23.501 --> 13:26.150
when I tell them
you saved the witches?

13:26.250 --> 13:28.999
That I didn't want you
to get 'em first!

13:30.292 --> 13:32.150
You had your chances, Belthazor.

13:32.250 --> 13:34.417
Don't screw up mine again.

13:35.083 --> 13:36.192
I strike tomorrow night.

13:36.292 --> 13:37.317
You better not be there.

13:37.417 --> 13:39.609
You don't scare me, Troxa.

13:39.709 --> 13:40.162
You never did.

13:40.172 --> 13:43.150
And you don't know how
to defeat me, Belthazor.

13:43.250 --> 13:44.709
You never could.

13:45.876 --> 13:47.042
After all...

13:47.876 --> 13:50.501
You can't fight
what you can't see.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.417
(<i>coughing</i>)

14:17.459 --> 14:18.192
Give me a hit of that.

14:18.292 --> 14:21.275
Actually no, just-just
pour it down my throat.

14:21.375 --> 14:23.317
You didn't sleep either?

14:23.417 --> 14:24.776
Not a wink.

14:24.876 --> 14:25.899
Thank God for makeup.

14:25.999 --> 14:28.651
Hey, maybe we should
get an alarm system.

14:28.751 --> 14:31.899
Hey, Pheebs, did you borrow
Gram's necklace again?

14:31.999 --> 14:32.692
No.

14:32.792 --> 14:33.983
Are you sure?

14:34.083 --> 14:34.942
Yeah, I'm positive. Why?

14:35.042 --> 14:38.692
What about my good luck blouse,
have you guys seen it?

14:38.792 --> 14:42.292
The fuchsia paisley one?

14:42.918 --> 14:44.484
Is anything else missing?

14:44.584 --> 14:45.234
Not that I know of.

14:45.334 --> 14:46.162
PHOEBE:
Prue, this
is important.

14:46.172 --> 14:48.899
Maybe the guy that broke into
the house took them.

14:48.999 --> 14:52.401
Yeah, or maybe it was a demon
who took them for some

14:52.501 --> 14:53.942
weird ritualistic
ceremony.

14:54.042 --> 14:54.692
Oh.
Oh.

14:54.792 --> 14:58.442
Now would that be the, uh...
the pillow-smothering demon

14:58.542 --> 15:00.442
or the lock picking demon?

15:00.542 --> 15:02.999
(<i>ethereal tone</i>)

15:04.999 --> 15:05.776
LEO:
They called me away on

15:05.876 --> 15:08.734
something else, Piper. I swear
it was a total coincidence.

15:08.834 --> 15:09.234
Mm-hmm.

15:09.334 --> 15:10.651
As far as the Triad's concerned,

15:10.751 --> 15:11.329
They don't know much.

15:11.339 --> 15:12.484
They don't even know
what it really is.

15:12.584 --> 15:14.567
Wow, 6,000 years of conflict,
and that's it?

15:14.667 --> 15:16.317
These guys are serious
underachievers.

15:16.417 --> 15:17.078
LEO:
What They do
know, though,

15:17.088 --> 15:20.899
is that the Triad is at the
highest level of the other side.

15:20.999 --> 15:21.899
Okay, that's a biggie.

15:21.999 --> 15:22.899
PRUE:
Yeah, well,

15:22.999 --> 15:25.999
that's why we need to get
to them before they get to us.

15:26.999 --> 15:27.526
What is this?

15:27.626 --> 15:29.375
A way to always
be prepared.

15:30.042 --> 15:32.401
These are very big
contraceptives, Prue.

15:32.501 --> 15:33.692
They are sneakers, all right?

15:33.792 --> 15:35.484
You know, we're
always wearing

15:35.584 --> 15:37.734
inappropriate footwear
when demons attack.

15:37.834 --> 15:39.150
Now we will be prepared.

15:39.250 --> 15:40.899
Keep them with you at all times.

15:40.999 --> 15:42.899
I'm going to be
so fast in these.

15:42.999 --> 15:44.999
(<i>doorbell rings</i>)

15:47.999 --> 15:49.025
Hi.

15:49.125 --> 15:49.899
Hi.

15:49.999 --> 15:50.776
We're making progress.

15:50.876 --> 15:51.776
The same set of fingerprints

15:51.876 --> 15:53.899
were found on all
the broken mirrors.

15:53.999 --> 15:54.567
Whose are they?

15:54.667 --> 15:55.734
Unfortunately,
the FBI computer

15:55.834 --> 15:56.412
came up with a blank,

15:56.422 --> 15:58.526
which just means the perp
had no criminal record.

15:58.626 --> 16:01.899
So what does that mean,
it's some weird crazy person?

16:01.999 --> 16:02.609
I can't say.

16:02.709 --> 16:03.412
I don't have enough to go on.

16:03.422 --> 16:06.818
I mean, we got... we got broken
mirrors and nothing's missing.

16:06.918 --> 16:08.234
Actually there is stuff missing.

16:08.334 --> 16:09.484
Our grandmother's necklace

16:09.584 --> 16:10.567
and Prue's
favorite shirt.

16:10.667 --> 16:12.567
It's funny that's
the only thing he took.

16:12.667 --> 16:14.818
You know, there is
another possibility.

16:14.918 --> 16:15.900
Could be a stalker.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.526
A stalker?

16:17.626 --> 16:18.899
Who would want to stalk us?

16:18.999 --> 16:19.412
Could be anybody.

16:19.422 --> 16:21.692
I need you to get
a human grudge list together.

16:21.792 --> 16:22.401
Old classmates,

16:22.501 --> 16:24.401
people you work
with or for,

16:24.501 --> 16:25.442
old boyfriends.

16:25.542 --> 16:26.484
Hey, what about Sean?

16:26.584 --> 16:29.109
What, that guy that I stood up
once? I don't think so.

16:29.209 --> 16:32.651
The smallest things can
set these guys off.

16:32.751 --> 16:35.899
All right, well, if it's a
stalker, it's a demonic stalker.

16:35.999 --> 16:36.899
DARRYL:
In any case,

16:36.999 --> 16:38.609
I'm going to check out
this Sean guy.

16:38.709 --> 16:41.067
I need that grudge
list ASAP.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.067
Stalkers will do anything

16:42.167 --> 16:44.359
to obtain the object
of their desire.

16:44.459 --> 16:46.900
You could be in real danger,
Prue.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.250
Thanks.

16:51.542 --> 16:53.209
Bye.

16:53.959 --> 16:55.275
You need to listen

16:55.375 --> 16:55.983
to him, Prue.

16:56.083 --> 16:57.818
Why? No one listens to me.

16:57.918 --> 16:58.412
Here, I got to go.

16:58.422 --> 17:01.999
If the demon doesn't kill me,
my editor will.

Uh, excuse me. Your
mail, Mr. Jones.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.541
Oh, great. Thank
you very much.
Sure.

17:52.334 --> 17:54.999
I did some research, Troxa.

17:57.083 --> 17:59.317
I found
your Achilles heel.

17:59.417 --> 18:01.484
Cold is very revealing for you.

18:01.584 --> 18:03.442
All the worse because,
since you can't feel,

18:03.542 --> 18:08.000
you don't even know
when it's cold.

18:09.792 --> 18:12.999
First them... then you.

18:23.042 --> 18:25.983
Just do what you normally do
on your TV show, okay?

18:26.083 --> 18:27.651
Just pretend
that I'm the audience.

18:27.751 --> 18:30.567
(<i>with Australian accent</i>):
Okay right, jillaroo.

18:30.667 --> 18:31.983
Now, the Australian

18:32.083 --> 18:33.275
black snake

18:33.375 --> 18:35.401
won't just run out
in the bush

18:35.501 --> 18:37.776
and strike at you
for no good reason.

18:37.876 --> 18:38.899
They strike

18:38.999 --> 18:39.746
as a defense mechanism.

18:39.756 --> 18:42.025
That's the only way
they can protect themselves.

18:42.125 --> 18:45.275
Now, you may wonder how we
enticed this little beaut

18:45.375 --> 18:47.234
out of the wild
to join us today.

18:47.334 --> 18:48.818
Over here,

18:48.918 --> 18:50.859
the only humane way

18:50.959 --> 18:52.818
to capture a snake

18:52.918 --> 18:53.899
is to use

18:53.999 --> 18:54.899
a snake trap.

18:54.999 --> 18:55.651
You lure them in

18:55.751 --> 18:57.317
with a ripping snake snack,

18:57.417 --> 19:00.109
like a tiny Mickey Mouse
or a froggie.

19:00.209 --> 19:04.651
Uh... what did you say
the cage was used for again?

19:04.751 --> 19:06.442
Trapping snakes--
or any other varmints

19:06.542 --> 19:08.401
you might want to get rid of.

19:08.501 --> 19:10.317
Really?

19:10.417 --> 19:11.692
Yeah.

Hi.

19:25.167 --> 19:26.359
Have you seen Cole?

Tall, dark, good looking,

Okay, no good.

19:31.042 --> 19:33.025
How about an easy one.
Where's Piper?

19:33.125 --> 19:35.526
Oh, she's in back
in the office.

19:35.626 --> 19:37.375
Okay, thanks.

19:42.751 --> 19:43.275
Oh!

19:43.375 --> 19:44.859
I should have knocked.

19:44.959 --> 19:46.776
I'm sorry!

19:46.876 --> 19:47.859
It's okay.

19:47.959 --> 19:49.317
I can't do it anyway.

19:49.417 --> 19:53.401
I am so sorry to hear that.

19:53.501 --> 19:55.609
I guess I'd better go.

19:55.709 --> 19:56.999
Yeah.

19:58.292 --> 20:02.876
I'm so tired of living
under this scrutiny.

20:03.834 --> 20:06.651
I told you I didn't
see anything.

20:06.751 --> 20:08.317
Not you, Them.

20:08.417 --> 20:08.899
I know.

20:08.999 --> 20:10.067
I thought doing it
somewhere else

20:10.167 --> 20:11.442
would take the pressure off.

20:11.542 --> 20:14.150
I'm bummed for you, Piper,
I really am,

20:14.250 --> 20:16.900
but I got to tell you
Leo is looking fine.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.317
I thought you said you
didn't see anything.

20:19.417 --> 20:20.942
Oh, nothing good.

20:21.042 --> 20:23.899
Okay, here is
my stalker list.

20:23.999 --> 20:27.899
It's mostly guys that I knew
when I was in New York.

20:27.999 --> 20:29.067
Wow! You were busy

20:29.167 --> 20:30.899
in New York.

20:30.999 --> 20:31.859
Yeah.

20:31.959 --> 20:34.651
Uh, so now that we have
mine and yours,

20:34.751 --> 20:36.999
all we need is...

20:38.292 --> 20:39.983
Whoo, wow!

20:40.083 --> 20:41.275
You look different.

20:41.375 --> 20:42.734
Relaxed.

20:42.834 --> 20:43.609
What happened?

20:43.709 --> 20:44.442
I'm just not as worried

20:44.542 --> 20:45.442
about demons as much anymore.

20:45.542 --> 20:47.899
Have you guys seen Sean around?

20:47.999 --> 20:48.442
No, I haven't.

20:48.542 --> 20:51.983
Uh, but how do you know
he's not your stalker?

20:52.083 --> 20:52.983
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

20:53.083 --> 20:55.899
What happened to
there's-a-demon-on-my-ass Prue?

20:55.999 --> 20:57.899
Well, um, I set a trap.

20:57.999 --> 20:58.287
A trap?

20:58.297 --> 21:00.442
Mm-hmm. We are going
to catch this demon

21:00.542 --> 21:02.651
and instead
of vanquishing him

21:02.751 --> 21:03.329
like we normally do,

21:03.339 --> 21:04.899
we're going to make him talk
about the Triad.

21:04.999 --> 21:08.692
So is this like a bear trap
with big claws?

21:08.792 --> 21:12.025
I cast a spell over a series
of siderite crystals,

21:12.125 --> 21:13.442
sort of creating a power grid,

21:13.542 --> 21:15.401
with <i>The Book of Shadows
</i> as the bait.

21:15.501 --> 21:16.899
And how does that work?

21:16.999 --> 21:19.899
Well, the minute the demon
steps into the grid,

21:19.999 --> 21:21.025
this glows

21:21.125 --> 21:22.401
and he's zapped.

21:22.501 --> 21:23.899
PIPER:
So whatever it is

21:23.999 --> 21:25.651
is electrocuted.

21:25.751 --> 21:27.234
Well, yeah, whatever demon.

21:27.334 --> 21:29.899
Mm-hmm. And what about human

21:29.999 --> 21:30.899
or feline?

21:30.999 --> 21:31.899
You're going to fry Kit.

21:31.999 --> 21:34.651
Well, Kit can't get in
because I locked the attic door.

21:34.751 --> 21:37.651
So, Prue, you've
booby-trapped our house.

21:37.751 --> 21:38.401
Mm-hmm.

21:38.501 --> 21:39.359
PHOEBE:
And again,

21:39.459 --> 21:40.651
what if it's human?

21:40.751 --> 21:41.526
It's not.

21:41.626 --> 21:42.859
Oh, all right,

21:42.959 --> 21:43.899
if you guys will excuse me,

21:43.999 --> 21:47.000
I... I have a life
to try and go live.

21:47.999 --> 21:49.442
Ah...

21:49.542 --> 21:50.692
This is not good.

21:50.792 --> 21:52.109
No, and if she actually
keeps this up,

21:52.209 --> 21:54.983
we're going to have
to do a demon intervention.

21:55.083 --> 21:55.983
Hi.

21:56.083 --> 21:57.899
Hey.
Thanks for coming.

21:57.999 --> 21:58.899
Um, oh Abbey,

21:58.999 --> 21:59.899
whatever Sean wants

21:59.999 --> 22:01.776
to drink, can you just...?

22:01.876 --> 22:02.245
No thanks.

22:02.255 --> 22:04.918
I've had more than
my share of free drinks.

22:05.042 --> 22:07.899
All right.
Well, I guess I deserved that.

22:07.999 --> 22:08.899
Um...

22:08.999 --> 22:12.818
look, Sean, there's so much
going on in my life

22:12.918 --> 22:13.983
that I can't really explain,

22:14.083 --> 22:17.818
but if you're interested,
I'd like to make it up to you.

22:17.918 --> 22:18.899
I'm definitely interested,

22:18.999 --> 22:21.942
but I just ask that you be
honest with me, okay?

22:22.042 --> 22:24.899
The one thing I can't
handle is games.

22:24.999 --> 22:26.999
Drives me crazy.

22:27.999 --> 22:30.359
Psycho, freaky crazy?

22:30.459 --> 22:31.918
What?

22:33.292 --> 22:34.999
Never mind.

22:37.667 --> 22:39.834
(<i>footsteps</i>)

22:46.999 --> 22:49.209
Phoebe?

22:53.999 --> 22:57.000
Anybody home?

23:28.209 --> 23:30.792
(<i>glass breaking</i>)

24:01.334 --> 24:02.999
Ooh.

24:28.042 --> 24:31.334
(<i>yelling</i>)

24:38.667 --> 24:40.859
(<i>ethereal tone</i>)

24:40.959 --> 24:42.692
What the hell is that?

24:42.792 --> 24:43.692
Oh!

24:43.792 --> 24:45.734
It worked!

24:45.834 --> 24:46.609
What worked?

24:46.709 --> 24:48.859
Uh, all right, it worked.
It worked.

24:48.959 --> 24:49.899
We caught our demon.

24:49.999 --> 24:51.459
So let's go.

24:57.083 --> 24:58.234
All right,
we don't really know

24:58.334 --> 24:59.275
what kind of demon
this is,

24:59.375 --> 25:00.204
so we have to
go in attacking.

25:00.214 --> 25:02.859
Piper, you freeze him,
and I will tie him up.

25:02.959 --> 25:04.899
Speaking of freezing,
it's freezing in here.

25:04.999 --> 25:07.899
Um, that's because every
window in the house is open.

25:07.999 --> 25:09.567
What kind of demon
would do that?

25:09.667 --> 25:10.317
PRUE:
Oh, who cares?

25:10.417 --> 25:11.899
Everybody got
their sneakers on?

25:11.999 --> 25:13.501
Yeah, yeah.
All right.

25:16.667 --> 25:17.359
Cole?
What?

25:17.459 --> 25:18.692
Wait!
It could be dangerous.

25:18.792 --> 25:20.859
For God sakes, Prue,
he looks really hurt.

25:20.959 --> 25:22.484
Phoebe, it's a trap
for demons.

25:22.584 --> 25:23.999
You do the math.

25:25.876 --> 25:27.067
What are you
doing here?

25:27.167 --> 25:29.899
Came by to see
how you were doing.

25:29.999 --> 25:31.250
Are you okay?

25:31.999 --> 25:32.983
PRUE:
So, how did
you get in

25:33.083 --> 25:34.442
and what are you doing up here?

25:34.542 --> 25:35.401
Front door
was unlocked.

25:35.501 --> 25:38.609
And then when I saw
the windows were open...

25:38.709 --> 25:42.292
You thought that someone broke
into the house again.

25:43.959 --> 25:46.942
Is the third degree
over now?

25:47.042 --> 25:49.899
What happened?

25:49.999 --> 25:51.584
What's that?

25:52.584 --> 25:53.567
Uh...

25:53.667 --> 25:55.067
It's a trap.

25:55.167 --> 25:57.000
A what?

25:58.125 --> 25:59.275
Cole, I am so sorry.

25:59.375 --> 26:00.275
Please forgive us.

26:00.375 --> 26:02.317
I'll take that
under advisement.

26:02.417 --> 26:03.317
Prue just panicked.

26:03.417 --> 26:04.526
She wasn't
thinking straight.

26:04.626 --> 26:05.150
The hell I wasn't!

26:05.250 --> 26:07.067
Do you know that your
trap is the equivalent

26:07.167 --> 26:09.025
of having a loaded shotgun
with a tripwire

26:09.125 --> 26:10.192
behind your front door?

26:10.292 --> 26:10.899
That's illegal!

26:10.999 --> 26:13.150
I'm an ADA;
an officer of the court,

26:13.250 --> 26:13.994
I could have you arrested!

26:14.004 --> 26:16.526
PIPER:
Somebody turned on
the air conditioning.

26:16.626 --> 26:18.484
Why would they do that?

26:18.584 --> 26:19.584
Hmm.

26:20.292 --> 26:22.626
I'm outta here.

26:26.584 --> 26:28.192
Cole. Cole?

26:28.292 --> 26:29.234
I am so sorry.

26:29.334 --> 26:30.899
It's just we've
all been under

26:30.999 --> 26:32.918
so much pressure lately.

26:33.334 --> 26:37.334
I'm just glad it wasn't you
who did this to me.

26:40.375 --> 26:43.417
(<i>footsteps receding</i>)

26:53.999 --> 26:55.025
How could you?

26:55.125 --> 26:57.609
How far are you gonna let this
obsession go, Prue?

26:57.709 --> 26:58.317
Phoebe, listen.

26:58.417 --> 26:59.692
No, I'm not gonna listen, Prue.

26:59.792 --> 27:01.192
You didn't nearly
catch a demon.

27:01.292 --> 27:02.692
You nearly killed

27:02.792 --> 27:03.609
a district attorney!

27:03.709 --> 27:05.067
<i>My</i> district attorney!

27:05.167 --> 27:07.025
How do you know
we didn't catch a demon?

27:07.125 --> 27:09.025
I mean, think
about it, Phoebe.

27:09.125 --> 27:12.109
He is always around
when something is going on.

27:12.209 --> 27:13.317
I mean, look at tonight.

27:13.417 --> 27:14.651
You're right.

27:14.751 --> 27:15.651
He's a plant

27:15.751 --> 27:18.692
trying to get close to me
so he can kill us.

27:18.792 --> 27:21.609
Now, is everyone
a demon, Prue?

27:21.709 --> 27:23.567
You are crazy right now.

27:23.667 --> 27:24.317
Prue?

27:24.417 --> 27:25.484
You have a lovely

27:25.584 --> 27:26.484
package from Sean.

27:26.584 --> 27:27.567
It looks like flowers.

27:27.667 --> 27:29.025
Pretty nice
for a guy

27:29.125 --> 27:30.999
you've blown off twice.

27:32.459 --> 27:32.899
Oh!

27:32.999 --> 27:34.526
PIPER:
Oh, that's disgusting!

27:34.626 --> 27:35.899
Look out.
Look out.

27:35.999 --> 27:37.317
Look out.

27:37.417 --> 27:39.442
There's your demon, Prue.

27:39.542 --> 27:41.083
I'm going to call Morris.

27:43.167 --> 27:44.734
(<i>sighs</i>)

27:44.834 --> 27:47.692
Piper, that doesn't
really make any sense.

27:47.792 --> 27:49.401
I mean,
I cannot believe

27:49.501 --> 27:51.567
I hurt that guy that badly.

27:51.667 --> 27:55.025
Darryl said it only takes
a small thing to set them off.

27:55.125 --> 27:56.192
Maybe Phoebe's right.

27:56.292 --> 27:58.067
Maybe you're just not seeing
the reality.

27:58.167 --> 27:59.983
Piper, my instincts
are almost always right.

28:00.083 --> 28:00.734
I have to trust them.

28:00.834 --> 28:04.899
You have to trust them, and I'm
not saying that you shouldn't,

28:04.999 --> 28:07.899
but Prue, there are other evils
in the world.

28:07.999 --> 28:10.417
And some of them are even human.

28:19.959 --> 28:20.900
I warned you,
Belthazor.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.109
Hold it, Troxa.
Cool your jets.

28:23.209 --> 28:24.651
I came to apologize.

28:24.751 --> 28:26.776
Apologize? For what?

28:26.876 --> 28:29.150
Pissing you off, for one thing.

28:29.250 --> 28:31.401
I don't want
to be always looking
over my shoulder

28:31.501 --> 28:34.317
waiting for you to strike
for the rest of eternity.

28:34.417 --> 28:36.734
You want
the Charmed Ones,

28:36.834 --> 28:38.734
they're all yours.

28:38.834 --> 28:41.025
I don't trust you.

28:41.125 --> 28:42.899
Fine, don't.

28:42.999 --> 28:46.501
Just don't blame your failure
on me to the Triad.

28:55.626 --> 28:55.983
Oh,

28:56.083 --> 28:57.899
by the way,
the key to getting them

28:57.999 --> 28:59.359
is in <i>The Book of Shadows.</i>

28:59.459 --> 29:01.542
It's up in the attic.

29:05.209 --> 29:06.899
(<i>grunts</i>)

29:06.999 --> 29:07.526
Be careful!

29:07.626 --> 29:09.609
Oh, you know what?
I don't care.

29:09.709 --> 29:10.245
I'm just so mad
at Prue.

29:10.255 --> 29:12.442
I mean, it's one thing
to be obsessive, you know,

29:12.542 --> 29:14.234
but it's another thing
to hurt innocent people!

29:14.334 --> 29:15.734
Okay, but she is trying
to look out for us.

29:15.834 --> 29:19.150
Oh! There is a Triad demon
on the loose.

29:19.250 --> 29:22.999
I understand that, Piper,
but it is not Cole.

29:27.167 --> 29:27.899
Oh, honey,

29:27.999 --> 29:30.150
that's sweet,
but not tonight.

29:30.250 --> 29:32.067
We all have headaches.

29:32.167 --> 29:32.899
Okay.

29:32.999 --> 29:34.401
PHOEBE:
But feel free

29:34.501 --> 29:36.751
to help us close
some windows.

29:40.542 --> 29:44.000
(<i>heartbeat thudding</i>)

30:05.959 --> 30:08.042
(<i>heartbeat thudding</i>)

30:16.999 --> 30:18.876
(<i>glass breaks</i>)

30:24.999 --> 30:27.584
(<i>gasps</i>)

30:30.584 --> 30:31.667
Oh!

30:35.292 --> 30:37.292
(<i>screaming</i>)

30:50.375 --> 30:50.995
I want you to tell me

30:51.005 --> 30:52.900
everything that you know
about the Triad.

30:53.000 --> 30:56.067
Who they are,
what their plans are.

30:56.167 --> 30:57.359
Answer me!

30:57.459 --> 31:00.334
You'll get nothing from me,
witch!

31:02.999 --> 31:04.999
(<i>screaming</i>)

31:08.918 --> 31:12.999
I... am... Troxa...

31:13.751 --> 31:15.109
but I am not the only
agent the Triad

31:15.209 --> 31:17.692
has sent after you.

31:17.792 --> 31:19.459
There is another.

31:20.250 --> 31:22.942
His name is Belthazo...!

31:23.042 --> 31:25.709
(<i>screaming</i>)

31:29.626 --> 31:32.067
All right, what
the hell happened?

31:32.167 --> 31:33.526
The Triad.

31:33.626 --> 31:34.942
PHOEBE:
Wait, so they know
where we live now?

31:35.042 --> 31:37.899
No, they'd know
where he is or was.

31:37.999 --> 31:39.692
All that matters
is he's gone.

31:39.792 --> 31:41.109
You were right, Prue.

31:41.209 --> 31:42.859
I owe you a big apology.

31:42.959 --> 31:44.150
PHOEBE:
I'm sorry
I doubted you,

31:44.250 --> 31:45.317
but I was worried.

31:45.417 --> 31:47.999
It's all right.
Let's, let's look him up.

31:55.459 --> 31:59.859
"Troxa, an invisible demon

31:59.959 --> 32:01.899
"whose weakness
is that his ectoplasmic

32:01.999 --> 32:04.899
"biochemistry is sensitive
to cold...

32:04.999 --> 32:07.234
...may become
partially visible."

32:07.334 --> 32:07.899
Wait a second.

32:07.999 --> 32:10.442
So if someone hadn't turned on
the AC,

32:10.542 --> 32:11.651
opened up
all the windows

32:11.751 --> 32:12.899
and made it freezing
in here,

32:12.999 --> 32:14.567
I never would have seen him.
Leo?

32:14.667 --> 32:16.526
I don't know anything about it
at all.

32:16.626 --> 32:18.899
Does that mean we have another
guardian angel?

32:18.999 --> 32:20.609
Well, I hope so. From what I've
heard about Belthazor,

32:20.709 --> 32:22.401
we're gonna need all the help
we can get.

32:22.501 --> 32:23.526
What do you mean?

32:23.626 --> 32:24.204
Well, he's infamous.

32:24.214 --> 32:26.776
He's a demonic soldier
of fortune.

32:26.876 --> 32:28.234
He's one of the
most evil,

32:28.334 --> 32:29.983
vile creatures there is.

32:30.083 --> 32:32.192
Wait, that's the demon
we saw

32:32.292 --> 32:33.899
try to take
<i>The Book of Shadows</i>

32:33.999 --> 32:35.150
a couple
of weeks ago.

32:35.250 --> 32:35.859
So Troxa's right.

32:35.959 --> 32:37.609
There's somebody else out there
to get us.

32:37.709 --> 32:40.317
Well, at least now we know
who he is.

32:40.417 --> 32:41.037
But we're safe for now.

32:41.047 --> 32:43.401
So I'm going to take this
rare opportunity

32:43.501 --> 32:45.401
to get a good night's sleep.

32:45.501 --> 32:47.317
LEO:
All right, well, I'll go
see what I can find out

32:47.417 --> 32:48.983
about Belthazor.

32:49.083 --> 32:50.109
Enjoy your candy.

32:50.209 --> 32:51.792
Thank you.
Sure.

32:57.626 --> 32:59.899
Are you gonna be able
to get some rest now?

32:59.999 --> 33:00.621
No, I am way too wired

33:00.631 --> 33:03.834
and also my photo assignment
is due tomorrow.

33:06.584 --> 33:06.899
Cole?

33:06.999 --> 33:10.526
Right. Uh, well, you know,

33:10.626 --> 33:13.899
I had to fill in something.

33:13.999 --> 33:16.442
Do you think maybe tomorrow
you could call Cole

33:16.542 --> 33:17.999
and apologize to him?

33:19.209 --> 33:21.792
Yeah.

34:10.998 --> 34:12.542
(<i>thud, Prue grunts</i>)

34:14.583 --> 34:17.983
I've got to meet, uh, Marvelous
3:00 this afternoon,

34:18.083 --> 34:19.317
so I need to get
some stuff ready.

34:19.417 --> 34:21.983
Can I drop you off?

34:22.083 --> 34:24.400
Hello? Anybody home?

34:24.501 --> 34:26.025
Oh, yeah, I was just
thinking.

34:26.125 --> 34:27.899
There are still
so many loose ends.

34:27.998 --> 34:31.234
I mean the broken mirrors,
the AC, the open windows,

34:31.333 --> 34:33.983
the dead flowers,
the stuff that's missing.

34:34.083 --> 34:35.234
Are you obsessing now?

34:35.333 --> 34:37.109
It's over, we were wrong.

34:37.208 --> 34:38.899
Well, I know, but those
aren't demonic things.

34:38.998 --> 34:43.525
They're things that a stalker
might do, like what Morris said.

34:43.626 --> 34:44.942
Well, you told him about Sean.

34:45.042 --> 34:46.150
He'll figure it out.

34:46.250 --> 34:48.192
Yeah. Sean.

34:48.292 --> 34:50.234
Um, where's our copy
of the grudge list

34:50.333 --> 34:51.859
that we made for Morris?

34:51.958 --> 34:53.275
I left it at the club. Why?

34:53.375 --> 34:55.109
I just... I want
to look it over again.

34:55.208 --> 34:55.942
Okay,

34:56.042 --> 34:56.899
well, let's go.

34:56.998 --> 34:57.900
Is Prue still sleeping?

34:58.000 --> 34:58.899
Her bed is made

34:58.999 --> 34:59.899
and her car is not here.

34:59.999 --> 35:03.526
Well, maybe she took
her pictures to 415.

35:03.626 --> 35:04.776
It's really early.

35:04.876 --> 35:06.983
I mean, is 415 even open yet?

35:07.083 --> 35:09.375
I'm going to call her.

35:11.083 --> 35:13.484

35:22.709 --> 35:23.899
It's me.
I'm just checking in.

35:23.999 --> 35:24.900
Where are you?

35:25.000 --> 35:26.651
I-I'm in my car.

35:26.751 --> 35:27.150
(<i>static</i>)

35:27.250 --> 35:29.359
Hello, Prue,
I can barely hear you.

35:29.459 --> 35:31.899
Yeah, I'm fine.
Okay, I'll see
you later, honey,

35:31.999 --> 35:33.859
bye.

35:33.959 --> 35:35.109
(<i>dial tone</i>)

35:35.209 --> 35:36.401
She sounds fine.

35:36.501 --> 35:37.751
Okay.

35:38.417 --> 35:40.125
Okay, let's go.

35:41.626 --> 35:44.942
(<i>footsteps</i>)

35:45.042 --> 35:46.918
Bye-bye.

35:50.834 --> 35:53.275
It's just you
and me now, Prue.
(<i>gasps</i>)

35:53.375 --> 35:55.000
Your sisters are gone.

35:58.584 --> 35:59.234
What do you want?

35:59.334 --> 36:05.626
Oh, Prue, isn't it
obvious what I want, huh?

36:06.751 --> 36:08.109
I want to be you.

36:08.209 --> 36:10.275
What, no witty comeback?

36:10.375 --> 36:14.899
No confident I'm-the-queen-
of-the-world retort, huh?

36:14.999 --> 36:15.859
Abbey...

36:15.959 --> 36:17.484
No, you're wrong!
Abbey's gone forever!

36:17.584 --> 36:19.899
She's a loser
and you're a winner!

36:19.999 --> 36:20.899
And now,

36:20.999 --> 36:24.859
I'm going to be a winner, too.

36:24.959 --> 36:26.999
As soon as I take care of you.

36:27.999 --> 36:29.025
(<i>laughing</i>)

36:29.125 --> 36:32.025
Did you like the dead
roses I sent you?

36:32.125 --> 36:32.567
Huh?

36:32.667 --> 36:35.899
Did you even know I was the one
who broke into your house?

36:35.999 --> 36:36.899
I have to be you!

36:36.999 --> 36:38.899
Oh, I love wearing

36:38.999 --> 36:40.484
your clothes!

36:40.584 --> 36:41.899
Your things.

36:41.999 --> 36:44.899
Makes me want
to be you even more.

36:44.999 --> 36:46.025
Beautiful,

36:46.125 --> 36:47.899
successful,

36:47.999 --> 36:49.899
loved by men.

36:49.999 --> 36:53.067
I have just as much trouble
with men as anyone.

36:53.167 --> 36:54.442
What,
you mean Sean?

36:54.542 --> 36:55.401
Oh, please!

36:55.501 --> 36:57.484
He's not good enough for us.

36:57.584 --> 36:58.651
Uh-uh. No, no.

36:58.751 --> 37:00.959
I can do better...

37:01.999 --> 37:03.983
Without you around.

37:04.083 --> 37:05.899
Now I just have

37:05.999 --> 37:07.899
one last question.

37:07.999 --> 37:09.067
Last night,

37:09.167 --> 37:09.900
when I was here,

37:10.000 --> 37:11.899
when I was running away

37:11.999 --> 37:12.899
from you,

37:12.999 --> 37:14.234
how the hell did you throw me

37:14.334 --> 37:15.734
through that door, huh?

37:15.834 --> 37:17.125
Like this!

37:26.999 --> 37:28.292
(<i>screams</i>)

37:31.999 --> 37:33.192

37:37.334 --> 37:38.692
P3.

37:38.792 --> 37:39.567
Piper, hey, hey, where's Prue?

37:39.667 --> 37:42.983
I can't reach her anywhere--
at the manor, on the cell.

37:43.083 --> 37:43.818
That's weird.

37:43.918 --> 37:45.818
We just talked to her
on her cell.

37:45.918 --> 37:46.899
Why, what's going on?

37:46.999 --> 37:47.609
I got a match up off

37:47.709 --> 37:49.609
those fingerprints
I got at your house.

37:49.709 --> 37:50.317
Sean?

37:50.417 --> 37:51.401
No, no, no, not Sean.

37:51.501 --> 37:52.734
Abbey, your bartender.

37:52.834 --> 37:54.692
The one off of your list.

37:54.792 --> 37:55.899
What? Abbey?

37:55.999 --> 37:58.651
W-Why would Abbey want
to hurt Prue?

37:58.751 --> 38:00.484
Abbey's hurt Prue?

38:00.584 --> 38:02.209
Hold on.

38:12.999 --> 38:13.900

Okay,

38:14.000 --> 38:16.776
and that's the kind of perfume

38:16.876 --> 38:17.859
Prue wears

38:17.959 --> 38:20.959

Nice.

to my heart âª

âª And she picked my brain
with a pocket knife âª

âª She said,

40:38.167 --> 40:43.542
âª So I said, I'm kinda hungry
and you ain't my type âª

âª She said I was cold as hell
but hell's not cold âª

40:48.292 --> 40:49.317
âª I know, I know âª

40:49.417 --> 40:52.651
âª Cause I've been there
for the last half hour or so âª

you a question?

just so excellent.

never be too careful

41:22.334 --> 41:25.359
So rumor has it
Leo is installing

41:25.459 --> 41:26.818
an alarm system in the house?

41:26.918 --> 41:27.442
Yeah, I know.

41:27.542 --> 41:28.983
And we're going to have
to lock the doors

41:29.083 --> 41:30.899
and do all that other
responsible stuff

41:30.999 --> 41:32.692
that women should do
in the big city.

41:32.792 --> 41:33.162
I agree.

to watch out for Belthazor.

41:36.999 --> 41:39.334
Yes, I agree.

kind of watch out for him.

41:58.125 --> 41:59.899
Really know him.

41:59.999 --> 42:01.609
Do you?

42:01.709 --> 42:06.692
Um, no, not as well
as I'd like to know him.

Actually, you know,

42:07.584 --> 42:10.651
I think I'm going to go see
what I can do about that.
