That was perfect.

Just perfect, thank you guys.

00:23.341 --> 00:24.777
I love you, Daddy.

00:24.789 --> 00:26.439
We miss you.

00:26.469 --> 00:29.242
- I miss you too.
- Did you get our present?

00:29.307 --> 00:30.723
Are you crazy?

00:31.069 --> 00:33.056
That's why I'm wearing it.

00:33.321 --> 00:34.581
Because I...

00:35.589 --> 00:36.969
'cause I love it.

00:37.641 --> 00:40.425
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye-bye, I love you.

00:40.485 --> 00:42.315
Bye, guys. I love you too, and,

00:42.570 --> 00:43.889
take care!

00:46.959 --> 00:49.149
I think they forgot what you look like.

00:49.179 --> 00:51.957
I'm sorry. I know all this
travelling's been hard.

00:52.059 --> 00:53.719
Hey, how's the villa?

00:54.171 --> 00:55.575
Idyllic.

00:56.006 --> 00:58.184
At least, according to your mother.

00:58.261 --> 01:00.279
I'll say it'll be better when you get here.

01:00.669 --> 01:03.303
- You are joining us?
- Tuesday, I hope.

01:03.339 --> 01:04.985
Oh, I hope so.

01:05.703 --> 01:07.263
Maybe we can go to that

01:07.293 --> 01:08.925
seafood restaurant.

01:08.991 --> 01:10.215
Yeah.

01:10.605 --> 01:12.615
The one next to the jazz bar.

01:14.175 --> 01:15.939
With the late night cocktails.

01:16.881 --> 01:18.507
Now you're talking.

01:20.433 --> 01:22.011
Matthias, are you all right?

01:22.325 --> 01:23.667
I'm fine.

01:23.913 --> 01:25.359
You seem a little...

01:28.305 --> 01:30.599
There's someone at the
door. I'll be right back, OK?

01:30.600 --> 01:31.800
OK.

01:32.925 --> 01:34.971
Jetzt hör halt auf mal, mich zu...

01:34.989 --> 01:36.255
anzuspritzen.

01:36.273 --> 01:39.267
Kids, can you keep it down a
bit? I'm trying to talk to Papa.

01:39.268 --> 01:40.820
Jan started it.

01:40.821 --> 01:42.941
- I don't care who started it, just...
- No!

01:43.743 --> 01:44.958
No!

01:45.147 --> 01:47.139
What do you want?

01:47.145 --> 01:48.476
- No! Don't touch me!
- Matthias?

01:48.501 --> 01:49.706
Matthias?

01:49.707 --> 01:51.140
Hey, Ruhe da...

01:52.078 --> 01:53.822
- Matt?
- _

01:58.965 --> 02:00.165
Pick up.

02:01.552 --> 02:03.346
He's not picking up.

02:03.962 --> 02:07.322
Can... find the number
for the police, in Zagreb.

02:07.442 --> 02:09.289
I think... Matt's been attacked.

03:13.706 --> 03:16.245
Matthias Schutte, widely respected expert

03:16.255 --> 03:19.231
on large scale water projects,
was allegedly thrown to his death

03:19.264 --> 03:22.706
from his hotel window after an
altercation with an unknown assailant.

03:22.730 --> 03:24.309
Herr Schutte was in Zagreb,

03:24.342 --> 03:28.321
consulting on diverting the Sava
River for a hydroelectric project.

03:28.322 --> 03:29.522
Wow.

03:29.523 --> 03:30.913
Re-routing a river.

03:31.033 --> 03:32.488
It's very large scale.

03:32.493 --> 03:33.895
And contentious.

03:33.896 --> 03:35.096
Really? Why?

03:35.254 --> 03:37.928
Well, rivers cross borders,
and with the climate change

03:37.938 --> 03:39.829
no one wants to end up high and dry.

03:40.285 --> 03:42.992
Dad bought me a subscription
to The Economist for Christmas.

03:43.031 --> 03:46.261
The Croatian government is going to
take a vote on it later this month.

03:46.597 --> 03:48.133
And Herr Schutte's

03:48.167 --> 03:50.797
report is considered a critical factor.

03:51.075 --> 03:52.907
And, depending on that vote,

03:52.908 --> 03:55.500
someone's gonna make or
loose an awful lot of money.

03:55.528 --> 03:57.405
One billion Euro.

03:58.773 --> 04:02.224
And the contractor is Purity
Construction, out of Munich.

04:02.248 --> 04:04.062
Vorsprung durch Technik.

04:04.076 --> 04:06.433
More German industries
sustaining the Euro zone.

04:06.446 --> 04:07.800
Do we know what

04:07.805 --> 04:10.416
Mr. Schutte was, ah, going to decide?

04:10.436 --> 04:12.524
Wasn't due to be turned in until next week.

04:12.595 --> 04:15.024
So we're thinking that somebody
didn't want him to finish it?

04:15.031 --> 04:16.231
Could be possible.

04:16.232 --> 04:17.507
Arabela, Luke, go down

04:17.507 --> 04:19.202
- to the crime scene.
- Yep.

04:19.355 --> 04:21.112
Uh, Sebastian and Ellie,

04:21.130 --> 04:23.809
need to go through his
phone, emails, financials...

04:23.810 --> 04:25.490
We've already got something.

04:25.499 --> 04:28.407
According to the hotel,
an hour before his death,

04:28.408 --> 04:32.656
he rang a Edgar Horvet, CEO of Purity.

04:33.554 --> 04:35.646
Deeply saddened at your loss.

04:35.858 --> 04:37.246
From Edgar,

04:37.247 --> 04:38.913
Sarah, and the boys.

04:39.059 --> 04:40.907
Send the biggest bouquet they make.

04:40.908 --> 04:42.108
Thank you.

04:47.539 --> 04:50.092
Are those crocodile tears or genuine?

04:53.523 --> 04:55.381
I've seen worse performances.

05:03.111 --> 05:04.311
Mr. Horvet,

05:04.501 --> 05:05.980
I'm Sebastian Berger,

05:05.985 --> 05:07.564
this is Elena Delfont-Bogard.

05:07.628 --> 05:09.169
Thank you very much for coming in.

05:10.233 --> 05:12.567
Do you have any idea who did this?

05:12.568 --> 05:13.768
Not yet.

05:14.428 --> 05:16.002
You've got to find him.

05:18.389 --> 05:21.225
If there's anything I
can do to help with, ah...

05:22.099 --> 05:23.337
anything.

05:24.610 --> 05:27.010
How well did you know Herr Schutte?

05:28.717 --> 05:30.134
Quite well.

05:30.602 --> 05:32.109
We'd been friends for

05:32.233 --> 05:33.772
nearly twenty years.

05:34.290 --> 05:37.110
Wasn't there a conflict of interest?

05:37.302 --> 05:40.932
Your best pal evaluating
your billion Euro contract?

05:40.933 --> 05:42.955
We met in university.

05:43.564 --> 05:46.824
Matt's integrity was beyond question.

05:47.508 --> 05:50.580
You spoke to Herr Schutte
an hour before he died.

05:50.743 --> 05:51.943
Yes.

05:52.362 --> 05:54.588
I spoke to him very often.

05:54.792 --> 05:56.784
He wanted to have the number of a

05:56.904 --> 05:59.333
geologist while working on the project.

05:59.334 --> 06:00.534
Name?

06:00.972 --> 06:02.328
Jurgen Muller.

06:02.676 --> 06:04.008
From Cologne.

06:04.428 --> 06:06.234
Why did he want to speak to him?

06:07.806 --> 06:09.186
He didn't say.

06:10.104 --> 06:11.508
How did he sound?

06:12.636 --> 06:13.974
"How did he sound"?

06:14.034 --> 06:15.330
What do you mean?

06:15.360 --> 06:18.252
His frame of mind. Did
he seem normal to you?

06:18.840 --> 06:20.280
Perfectly normal.

06:20.796 --> 06:23.352
Did he indicate what his
report would have said?

06:23.370 --> 06:24.840
Of course not.

06:25.584 --> 06:26.898
But he would have approved it.

06:26.916 --> 06:28.430
How can you be so sure?

06:28.644 --> 06:29.874
This dam

06:30.132 --> 06:31.547
is vitally important.

06:31.548 --> 06:33.924
It will provide hydroelectric power,

06:33.925 --> 06:36.335
irrigation, and drinking
water for millions of people.

06:36.336 --> 06:38.772
Well, it is our understanding
that it will also flood

06:38.773 --> 06:40.903
half a dozen villages,
causing thousands of people

06:40.904 --> 06:42.762
- to lose their homes.
- No, no. No, no, no, no, no.

06:42.768 --> 06:44.652
They'd be relocated.

06:44.880 --> 06:46.476
And very well compensated.

06:46.512 --> 06:49.344
- And the environmental impact?
- Insignificant.

06:49.379 --> 06:50.579
Look,

06:51.768 --> 06:55.242
I understand why you are
asking all these questions,

06:55.296 --> 06:58.201
but there's nothing in the world
could make me harm Matthias Schutte.

06:58.506 --> 06:59.710
Nothing.

07:01.637 --> 07:02.842
If there's anything else,

07:02.843 --> 07:05.014
- you have my number.
- Of course, yeah.

07:07.481 --> 07:08.681
Annie.

07:09.984 --> 07:11.442
I'm so sorry.

07:17.859 --> 07:19.173
Are you all right?

07:19.896 --> 07:21.144
How about the children?

07:21.396 --> 07:23.724
I don't think it's really sunk in yet.

07:23.922 --> 07:25.133
For any of us.

07:25.134 --> 07:27.906
Come and stay with Sarah and
me, we have plenty of room.

07:28.080 --> 07:30.624
Well, the kids are with
my parents right now, but,

07:30.852 --> 07:32.154
thank you.

07:33.158 --> 07:34.481
We're here.

07:35.010 --> 07:37.080
- We want you to know that.
- Oh, I know.

07:42.440 --> 07:43.784
Let's go this way.

07:43.969 --> 07:45.169
This way.

07:45.876 --> 07:48.600
Edgar Horvet and your
husband were good friends?

07:48.798 --> 07:50.582
They met at university.

07:51.060 --> 07:54.360
Doing, um, volunteer work in Sarajevo.

07:54.768 --> 07:57.000
Clearing debris to rebuild roads.

07:57.192 --> 07:59.288
Your husband had a social conscience.

07:59.754 --> 08:01.005
Always.

08:01.782 --> 08:04.889
He... he wanted to set a
good example for the children.

08:04.890 --> 08:07.428
Hm. It's not so easy in this day and age.

08:08.934 --> 08:10.908
His faith helped.

08:11.144 --> 08:12.987
Also increasingly rare.

08:13.226 --> 08:14.930
You're a religious family?

08:15.908 --> 08:18.632
I'm Church of England. Lapsed.

08:18.752 --> 08:21.680
But, Matthias is a practising Catholic.

08:25.358 --> 08:27.273
He was a wonderful man.

08:30.476 --> 08:31.734
You probably hear

08:31.735 --> 08:34.118
a lot of wives say that
about their husbands.

08:35.912 --> 08:37.932
Not as many as you might think.

08:40.322 --> 08:42.355
Was there anything unusual going on,

08:42.356 --> 08:44.846
um, at work, any kind of a problem?

08:45.770 --> 08:46.976
Um, we,

08:47.036 --> 08:51.200
made a pact to keep conversations
about work out of the home.

08:52.766 --> 08:56.138
You told the Zagreb police
that you heard arguing.

08:56.619 --> 08:57.891
In German.

08:58.443 --> 09:00.992
He was too far to hear what he was saying.

09:01.304 --> 09:03.350
Were you able to understand anything?

09:03.689 --> 09:04.891
"Get off".

09:06.440 --> 09:07.928
"What do you want?".

09:08.260 --> 09:09.460
"No".

09:10.550 --> 09:12.230
Hm, sorry.

09:14.966 --> 09:17.006
How do you know that it was a man?

09:18.611 --> 09:20.793
Well, I assume it was.

09:20.876 --> 09:24.524
Who else would have the strength
to throw Matthias out of a window?

09:25.252 --> 09:27.651
_

09:27.771 --> 09:30.528
_

09:38.328 --> 09:39.811
According to the police report,

09:39.812 --> 09:42.011
Mr. Schutte fell from the window up there,

09:42.020 --> 09:45.186
landed on a police car here,
just after it pulled up.

09:45.490 --> 09:48.896
How long after his wife witnessed
the altercation over the video call?

09:49.111 --> 09:50.503
Seven minutes.

09:50.586 --> 09:53.108
Seven minutes? That's quite a struggle.

09:53.881 --> 09:56.522
Was anyone else seen coming
in or out of his room?

09:56.523 --> 09:57.723
Nope.

09:59.891 --> 10:02.984
Hotel records indicate
that Mr. Schutte stayed here

10:03.002 --> 10:05.552
six times in the last three months.

10:05.876 --> 10:08.082
Plenty of opportunities to stray.

10:08.083 --> 10:10.438
I don't know. Carine got
the impression from the wife

10:10.439 --> 10:12.031
that they were happily married.

10:12.341 --> 10:13.941
And things are always what they seem?

10:14.544 --> 10:16.608
Is that supposed to mean anything?

10:16.867 --> 10:18.082
Just what I said.

10:19.905 --> 10:21.758
Fingerprints? Hair and fibre?

10:21.941 --> 10:23.424
Well, it is a hotel, so,

10:23.439 --> 10:26.746
lots of partials on the
door handles, glasses.

10:27.063 --> 10:29.525
So far, only the victim's confirmed.

10:30.149 --> 10:31.988
The wife also states

10:31.997 --> 10:34.642
she heard him arguing
with somebody in German.

10:34.690 --> 10:37.282
Which means that the killer
was a German speaker as well.

10:37.283 --> 10:38.937
It's a place to start.

10:39.528 --> 10:41.390
Do you want to tell me what's going on?

10:42.245 --> 10:45.284
'Cause you've been giving
me the perma-freeze all week.

10:45.285 --> 10:46.485
All week?

10:46.501 --> 10:48.232
You mean since we went to that bar.

10:48.233 --> 10:49.433
Lorraine.

10:49.828 --> 10:51.518
You didn't know about Lorraine.

10:51.869 --> 10:53.300
You know that I didn't.

10:53.777 --> 10:55.299
I'm sorry, I...

10:55.706 --> 10:58.305
I like to keep my private life private.

10:59.293 --> 11:00.581
I should have told you.

11:00.582 --> 11:01.782
I guess.

11:01.783 --> 11:02.983
Yeah.

11:02.984 --> 11:04.213
I guess.

11:06.878 --> 11:08.361
Hydroelectric power,

11:08.384 --> 11:09.662
irrigation systems,

11:09.681 --> 11:12.181
and treatment plants, will provide energy

11:12.220 --> 11:13.648
improve agriculture,

11:13.656 --> 11:15.614
and purify drinking water.

11:15.734 --> 11:17.134
Life enhancing,

11:17.195 --> 11:18.487
life giving.

11:19.257 --> 11:21.442
Oh, they don't show
you these on that video.

11:21.443 --> 11:22.548
And those are?

11:22.549 --> 11:26.184
Displaced villagers protesting
against the forced relocations.

11:26.185 --> 11:29.266
Mr. Horvet said that they'd
been fully compensated.

11:29.267 --> 11:31.125
But the residents beg to differ, huh?

11:31.163 --> 11:32.879
Oh, in every town along the way

11:32.880 --> 11:35.321
there have been protests,
including environmentalists.

11:35.322 --> 11:37.196
- Environmentalists?
- He said to us

11:37.208 --> 11:39.780
there would be no significant impact, but,

11:40.345 --> 11:43.978
protesters say that they'd be a
huge disruption of wildlife habitat.

11:43.979 --> 11:46.338
Including the migratory
pattern of the corncrake.

11:46.649 --> 11:48.709
- The what?
- The corncrake.

11:48.710 --> 11:50.728
It's a globally threatened species of bird.

11:50.753 --> 11:52.935
It relies on these wet meadowlands.

11:53.045 --> 11:54.481
The corncrake.

11:55.248 --> 11:57.936
Herr Schutte concluded that
the threat was negligible.

11:58.196 --> 12:00.450
I was able to access
his notes off the cloud.

12:00.570 --> 12:03.212
- And?
- From what I can see, Horvet was right.

12:03.569 --> 12:05.358
This report would have
supported the project.

12:05.377 --> 12:08.369
What? Despite the protests,
despite the relocations?

12:08.376 --> 12:09.886
Despite the corncrake.

12:11.818 --> 12:15.331
Well, I guess his death had nothing
to do with the river after all.

12:15.338 --> 12:16.538
Maybe.

12:17.103 --> 12:18.411
Except for this.

12:22.469 --> 12:23.669
Oh.

12:24.734 --> 12:25.934
Jurgen Muller,

12:25.935 --> 12:28.112
the geologist Matthias
Schutte wanted to contact?

12:28.113 --> 12:29.331
What about him?

12:29.874 --> 12:31.174
Well, he's dead.

12:31.721 --> 12:32.921
Dead how?

12:32.922 --> 12:36.522
Jurgen Muller, attending a renewable
energy conference in Munich.

12:36.609 --> 12:38.149
Until two days ago,

12:38.437 --> 12:41.590
when he fell to his death from
his hotel room balcony at 1 a.m.

12:41.591 --> 12:42.659
No witnesses?

12:42.660 --> 12:46.044
No. And the police say there
was no suspicious circumstances.

12:46.052 --> 12:48.258
Alcohol and cocaine in his blood stream.

12:48.452 --> 12:50.118
A light rain falling, it was...

12:50.119 --> 12:51.196
slippery.

12:51.197 --> 12:52.492
Only one problem.

12:52.572 --> 12:54.290
- Which is?
- According to Muller's widow,

12:54.291 --> 12:55.331
he didn't drink.

12:55.332 --> 12:56.807
Never even smoke a joint.

12:56.953 --> 12:58.552
That is a problem.

13:06.230 --> 13:07.433
What are these?

13:07.434 --> 13:08.747
These are from Munich.

13:08.874 --> 13:11.464
The hotel where our
geologist, Muller, died.

13:11.508 --> 13:12.927
If he was really pushed,

13:12.999 --> 13:14.606
someone had to walk in and out.

13:17.111 --> 13:18.806
- What?
- That man.

13:18.807 --> 13:20.187
I've seen him before.

13:23.671 --> 13:25.005
Yeah, look, see.

13:25.227 --> 13:26.836
He's one of the protesters.

13:29.283 --> 13:33.024
May I congratulate you on your
inspired police work, Inspector?

13:33.025 --> 13:35.812
Well, 10% inspired, 90% desired.

13:37.188 --> 13:39.164
He's an attractive... chap.

13:41.474 --> 13:43.833
Roberto Savio, from Croatia.

13:50.184 --> 13:51.385
You have anything?

13:51.801 --> 13:53.005
Plenty.

13:53.006 --> 13:55.356
Mr. Savio is from the town of Sisak.

13:55.546 --> 13:58.308
Which is only around a
hundred kilometres away

13:58.309 --> 14:00.702
from where our water
expert fell to this death.

14:01.495 --> 14:03.482
Stopping Herr Schutte
from issuing his report

14:03.483 --> 14:04.783
could be seen as motive.

14:04.975 --> 14:07.247
And there's a volatile history.

14:07.957 --> 14:11.192
Savio was arrested at marches and
demonstrations all over Europe.

14:11.840 --> 14:13.129
Can you get his address?

14:13.130 --> 14:15.511
_

14:15.580 --> 14:18.549
_

14:35.837 --> 14:37.037
I'll take the back.

15:14.150 --> 15:16.557
Mr. Savio? ICC, open up!

15:57.337 --> 15:58.537
Shit.

16:02.195 --> 16:03.420
That's him, right?

16:06.212 --> 16:08.073
Not so attractive any more, huh?

16:09.346 --> 16:11.808
- Can you get the names of those?
- Of course.

16:11.809 --> 16:13.218
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

16:17.933 --> 16:21.683
So, there was three German nationals
staying at the hotel yesterday.

16:21.684 --> 16:23.089
She's gonna get their names.

16:23.712 --> 16:25.332
And what about the staff?

16:26.006 --> 16:29.321
Well, apparently, the receptionist
Nadia speaks a little German.

16:29.323 --> 16:32.024
Well, she doesn't look like she
could push anybody out the window.

16:32.040 --> 16:33.240
So...

16:33.427 --> 16:36.803
- CCTV here looks very discreet.
- You could say that.

16:36.857 --> 16:38.123
Like, there isn't any.

16:38.232 --> 16:39.599
The only cameras they've got

16:39.600 --> 16:41.650
are outside the main entrance
and at the front gate.

16:41.867 --> 16:44.211
- Great. Well, I'll go check with security.
- Cool.

16:48.323 --> 16:50.741
Looks like a party for
one, but a bit out of hand.

16:51.884 --> 16:54.376
Auto-erotic asphyxiation.

16:54.819 --> 16:57.093
Not a very dignified way to go, is it?

16:58.120 --> 16:59.536
Anything useful there?

16:59.713 --> 17:02.829
Mainly household bills.
Pretty boring so far.

17:03.213 --> 17:05.348
Looks like he's been
dead for a couple of days.

17:05.971 --> 17:08.061
Well, then he couldn't
have killed Herr Schutte.

17:08.256 --> 17:10.507
Not unless he's the walking dead.

17:12.488 --> 17:15.226
This bruising looks way too
heavy to have been self-inflicted.

17:15.827 --> 17:17.313
What, you're saying it was murder?

17:17.906 --> 17:19.263
That's what I'm saying.

17:20.194 --> 17:22.952
Think it was staged to
look like something else.

17:33.185 --> 17:34.385
Hello?

17:34.495 --> 17:37.323
Ah, we're with the ICC.
Do you speak English?

17:39.086 --> 17:40.952
No! Wait, stop!

17:40.981 --> 17:43.134
Don't run! Wait, please!

17:43.196 --> 17:46.382
- No!
- Step away! Get back from here. Get back!

17:46.391 --> 17:47.819
- Let go!
- No!

17:47.889 --> 17:49.325
Hey, let me go!

17:49.375 --> 17:50.828
I'm pregnant, you bastard!

17:50.829 --> 17:52.875
- Calm down.
- Let go of me!

17:55.345 --> 17:58.523
This is Mr. Schutte an hour before he died.

17:58.576 --> 18:00.035
An hour before he died?

18:00.431 --> 18:02.069
That's when he spoke to Edgar Horvet.

18:02.379 --> 18:04.151
This is five minutes after that.

18:04.774 --> 18:06.029
What's in the envelope?

18:08.800 --> 18:10.641
Do we know where he might've gone?

18:11.154 --> 18:13.607
There are a couple of shops
within walking distance, but

18:13.620 --> 18:16.102
the police say none of
them remember seeing him.

18:16.134 --> 18:17.581
And when did he get back?

18:19.322 --> 18:22.317
Uh, twenty minutes after that.

18:22.960 --> 18:24.365
No envelope.

18:24.479 --> 18:26.012
No envelope.

18:27.011 --> 18:29.672
_

18:29.673 --> 18:32.386
_

18:41.899 --> 18:44.615
Mrs. Savio, I'm really sorry for your loss.

18:44.667 --> 18:46.277
What the fuck am I doing here?

18:46.348 --> 18:48.804
I have my husband's body to bury back home.

18:48.957 --> 18:51.119
Well, we told you the circumstances

18:51.120 --> 18:52.837
in which we found your husband's body.

18:52.853 --> 18:54.505
Yes you have, and it's bullshit.

18:54.709 --> 18:56.815
- What do you mean?
- Sex games?

18:56.898 --> 18:58.098
Roberto?

18:58.373 --> 18:59.573
Come on.

18:59.891 --> 19:02.814
It took two months with me before
he could even leave the lights on.

19:02.934 --> 19:04.456
The coroner's report

19:04.686 --> 19:06.796
showed that he died two days ago.

19:06.797 --> 19:08.510
Could you please tell me where you were?

19:08.511 --> 19:10.339
Ah ha, so now you're accusing me?

19:10.461 --> 19:11.661
Huh?

19:11.970 --> 19:14.039
I was at a protest in Zagreb.

19:14.054 --> 19:16.176
And I have thousands of witnesses, OK?

19:16.183 --> 19:17.383
'Kay.

19:18.273 --> 19:21.284
Well, do you have any idea
who may have been involved?

19:21.303 --> 19:22.503
Yeah.

19:22.504 --> 19:23.897
You can take your pick

19:23.934 --> 19:26.306
from the corporatocracy
you're all paid to protect.

19:26.342 --> 19:27.766
And let me tell you something:

19:27.794 --> 19:30.747
Roberto was a warrior against injustice.

19:31.573 --> 19:33.089
These injustices

19:33.152 --> 19:34.694
that your husband warred against,

19:34.695 --> 19:37.131
they included the
re-routing of the Sava River?

19:37.165 --> 19:38.739
- Especially that.
- Why?

19:39.109 --> 19:40.786
That dam they're building

19:41.113 --> 19:43.054
will rape the environment.

19:43.234 --> 19:45.321
It will ruin thousands of lives.

19:45.322 --> 19:49.334
I'm talking about thousands of families
who have lived there for generations.

19:52.302 --> 19:53.502
Um...

19:55.377 --> 19:57.578
Do you know either of these men?

20:01.577 --> 20:04.395
This one, no, but, this is Jurgen.

20:06.726 --> 20:07.926
He was cool.

20:08.853 --> 20:10.053
Cool?

20:10.569 --> 20:11.880
He's a geologist.

20:11.978 --> 20:14.236
A scientist with integrity.

20:14.356 --> 20:16.113
Roberto used to share information with him.

20:16.128 --> 20:17.425
What kind of information?

20:17.545 --> 20:19.356
Ground water contamination,

20:19.927 --> 20:22.209
toxicity levels, that kind of thing.

20:22.248 --> 20:25.627
Your husband was sighted
leaving Muller's hotel room

20:25.642 --> 20:27.378
in Munich two nights ago.

20:27.498 --> 20:29.446
Do you have any idea what they spoke about?

20:30.636 --> 20:32.057
Why don't you ask Jurgen?

20:32.058 --> 20:34.206
I can't. He's dead.

20:34.464 --> 20:35.665
What?

20:35.716 --> 20:38.871
I told your other investigators before.

20:39.832 --> 20:41.183
Matthias' death

20:41.548 --> 20:43.553
has nothing to do with us.

20:43.837 --> 20:47.156
You also told them the dam
has no environmental impact.

20:47.399 --> 20:50.123
Illegal dumping in the
Balkans is hardly news.

20:50.161 --> 20:51.439
Cancer rates,

20:51.559 --> 20:53.325
brain tumours on the rise.

20:53.462 --> 20:57.405
And the governments duly produce
evidence to refute the conspiracies.

20:57.801 --> 20:59.503
According to Savio's widow,

20:59.556 --> 21:04.067
the geologist, Muller, said that
the water would be contaminated.

21:04.608 --> 21:07.427
So you think that's why
Matthias wanted to speak to him?

21:07.696 --> 21:12.115
We think Muller already told Herr
Schutte the water would be contaminated.

21:12.116 --> 21:14.127
And given how close you were,

21:14.307 --> 21:17.216
perhaps Matthias told you too. His friend.

21:17.217 --> 21:20.019
That would have been
completely inappropriate.

21:20.575 --> 21:22.905
And a violation of his professional ethics.

21:22.906 --> 21:25.171
A billion Euros, Mr. Horvet.

21:25.177 --> 21:27.068
It's such a big job.

21:27.314 --> 21:28.694
And he knew,

21:28.814 --> 21:31.034
how important it would be to you.

21:31.710 --> 21:33.265
So you think

21:33.419 --> 21:34.843
he told me

21:34.905 --> 21:37.251
he was going to advise against the dam,

21:37.463 --> 21:38.663
and then,

21:38.994 --> 21:40.536
I have him killed.

21:40.869 --> 21:42.137
Did you?

21:48.834 --> 21:50.717
OK, what have we got?

21:50.885 --> 21:53.750
Remember, I had no luck with
vehicle registration plates,

21:53.751 --> 21:56.013
near the hotels where
Schutte and Muller died?

21:57.181 --> 22:00.137
We now have Savio's cottage to factor in.

22:00.138 --> 22:02.070
Motorbikes are a nightmare.

22:02.320 --> 22:04.331
They nip behind lorries, buses,

22:04.356 --> 22:06.455
they slip past speed cameras

22:06.456 --> 22:09.073
if the rider knows what
they're doing. But this...

22:09.335 --> 22:12.858
is two block from Muller's hotel in
Munich the day he fell off the balcony,

22:12.882 --> 22:14.082
and this,

22:14.351 --> 22:18.922
is a highway junction about two
kilometres from Savio's cottage in Slovenia

22:18.923 --> 22:21.352
on the day we estimate he was murdered.

22:21.656 --> 22:24.296
Well, I might be a tad more enthusiastic

22:24.297 --> 22:27.245
if the driver wasn't wearing
the same leathers and the, ah,

22:27.246 --> 22:29.325
license plates on the bikes were the same.

22:29.508 --> 22:31.550
- This is a Ducati...
- Ducati Superlight.

22:33.299 --> 22:34.499
Yeah.

22:34.591 --> 22:37.730
The highest powered model
outside the professional circuit.

22:37.850 --> 22:39.388
On the market for a year.

22:39.391 --> 22:42.035
These alloys were introduced six weeks ago.

22:42.050 --> 22:43.384
And only in Europe.

22:43.399 --> 22:46.520
Which narrows the ownership
down to exactly sixteen,

22:46.533 --> 22:47.733
across the continent.

22:47.751 --> 22:49.683
And only of these owners is

22:49.689 --> 22:52.743
a mercenary with a criminal
record for manslaughter.

22:53.389 --> 22:55.437
Fabian Sattler, 42.

22:55.457 --> 22:58.232
Austrian national, but lives
on the Austrian peninsula.

22:58.233 --> 23:01.601
Has previous for manslaughter,
and various other violent conducts.

23:01.619 --> 23:03.941
He's known by the police
in numerous countries.

23:03.953 --> 23:05.958
A gun for hire living in the area.

23:06.007 --> 23:07.275
Another, uh,

23:07.311 --> 23:08.512
big coincidence?

23:08.567 --> 23:10.371
Get the list to Luke and Arabela.

23:10.372 --> 23:11.805
Right away.

23:14.998 --> 23:16.198
Good.

23:18.506 --> 23:19.932
We have a suspect.

23:20.261 --> 23:21.651
Fabian Sattler.

23:21.657 --> 23:23.311
His Ducati was spotted at both

23:23.334 --> 23:25.795
- Muller and Savio's crime scenes.
- Good.

23:25.807 --> 23:27.818
- Anything on the CCTV here?
- No.

23:27.831 --> 23:30.172
I would have remembered
seeing a motorcycle like that.

23:32.388 --> 23:33.588
What?

23:33.975 --> 23:36.273
Our German speaking receptionist.

23:37.036 --> 23:38.237
Nadia.

23:38.358 --> 23:40.544
She averts her eyes
every time I look at her.

23:40.790 --> 23:42.417
Well, maybe you should stop staring.

23:42.466 --> 23:44.215
Like she's hiding something.

23:47.622 --> 23:50.858
We understand Mr. Schutte was
a regular guest at this hotel?

23:50.859 --> 23:53.009
- Yes.
- And did you speak to him?

23:53.300 --> 23:55.683
I lived in Hamburg when I was a teenager.

23:55.684 --> 23:57.392
I speak a little German.

23:58.536 --> 24:00.590
I think that you know something, Nadia.

24:00.626 --> 24:02.272
Something you're not telling us.

24:03.240 --> 24:05.928
This job was very difficult to find.

24:06.324 --> 24:09.043
Nadia, this is a murder investigation.

24:09.055 --> 24:10.646
It is very serious.

24:13.150 --> 24:15.869
I'm supposed to register
all overnight stays, but,

24:16.497 --> 24:18.222
but sometimes, I didn't.

24:18.823 --> 24:20.328
If the guest was...

24:21.262 --> 24:23.243
as nice as Mr. Schutte.

24:23.296 --> 24:26.112
Mr. Schutte had a visitor
the night before he died?

24:27.673 --> 24:29.203
Was it this man?

24:30.651 --> 24:32.053
No. Not him.

24:32.345 --> 24:34.326
Well, can you describe him for us?

24:35.448 --> 24:37.020
I can do better than that.

24:37.249 --> 24:39.376
I can tell you where to find him.

24:52.281 --> 24:54.110
Hey, good looking.

24:54.146 --> 24:55.346
Hey.

24:56.140 --> 24:58.304
Not exactly dressed for the beach, are you?

24:58.305 --> 25:00.634
No. Not exactly.

25:01.717 --> 25:03.670
Arabela Seeger, ICC.

25:03.777 --> 25:05.472
I'll need you to come with me.

25:06.319 --> 25:09.022
_

25:09.023 --> 25:11.196
_

25:11.197 --> 25:13.243
Jovan Petric, 25.

25:13.304 --> 25:15.847
Works the holidays resort
as an upmarket escort.

25:15.848 --> 25:18.620
Apparently, Matthias Schutte was a client.

25:19.004 --> 25:22.558
Well, looks like Mrs. Schutte didn't
know her husband as well as she thought.

25:22.771 --> 25:25.807
Petric was a regular for a
number of guests at the hotel.

25:26.112 --> 25:28.166
The receptionist kept him off the books,

25:28.349 --> 25:31.725
and he left her a big old tip the
morning that Matthias was killed.

25:48.082 --> 25:49.593
Your website,

25:50.626 --> 25:52.625
balkanboys.com

25:52.863 --> 25:55.697
says here, â¬500 for a night.

25:56.310 --> 25:58.059
Well, I'm worth it.

25:58.714 --> 26:01.256
Book a session with me,
and you'll see yourself.

26:07.602 --> 26:10.674
How long have you known
Matthias Schutte for?

26:12.167 --> 26:13.566
Um,

26:14.776 --> 26:16.160
about a year.

26:16.440 --> 26:18.196
Whenever he was in town.

26:18.854 --> 26:20.159
Matthias...

26:20.475 --> 26:22.158
craved intimacy.

26:22.768 --> 26:25.858
- Was he a good client?
- Oh, he was ideal.

26:26.065 --> 26:27.797
Gentle, clean,

26:27.917 --> 26:29.662
and paid very well.

26:31.866 --> 26:34.450
On Wednesday morning,
how did you leave things?

26:35.958 --> 26:37.208
Well,

26:37.610 --> 26:39.914
I'd say he had a smile on his face.

26:40.399 --> 26:42.440
And what about before you left?

26:42.727 --> 26:45.134
He was always quiet, I suppose.

26:45.482 --> 26:47.385
The closet ones often are.

26:47.542 --> 26:49.161
Talked about his kids,

26:49.760 --> 26:53.027
tried to persuade me to kiss him properly.

26:54.003 --> 26:56.078
Mattie was a gentleman, so,

26:56.079 --> 26:58.543
he got a quick brush on the lips.

27:00.786 --> 27:05.144
You claim that you left the hotel
via the staff entrance at 7:45.

27:05.964 --> 27:07.195
Yes.

27:08.228 --> 27:11.154
Twenty minutes later,
Matthias went for a walk.

27:11.818 --> 27:13.342
Do you know where he might have gone?

27:14.020 --> 27:16.428
I was halfway to the airport by then.

27:16.916 --> 27:20.116
Ask Nadia on reception,
she ordered my taxi.

27:20.350 --> 27:21.941
We already have.

27:28.221 --> 27:30.074
You ever seen this man before?

27:31.057 --> 27:32.289
Who is he?

27:32.409 --> 27:34.032
Jurgen Muller.

27:34.294 --> 27:35.879
He's a geologist.

27:38.134 --> 27:40.041
Only in my dreams.

27:43.212 --> 27:46.138
- Well, entertaining at
least. - But a dead-end.

27:46.162 --> 27:49.453
Sebastian found an address on our
motorcycle man outside of Cologne.

27:49.471 --> 27:51.165
He and Ellie are on their way now.

27:51.189 --> 27:53.425
_

27:53.426 --> 27:56.213
_

28:14.687 --> 28:16.262
What the fuck!

28:16.263 --> 28:17.661
Stick 'em up.

28:20.448 --> 28:21.959
Jurgen Muller.

28:22.572 --> 28:23.838
You were in Munich,

28:23.876 --> 28:26.838
the day before Muller fell
from his hotel balcony.

28:26.839 --> 28:30.155
Two streets away, we have
your motorbike as evidence.

28:30.239 --> 28:31.645
Coincidence?

28:32.129 --> 28:34.445
Um, I had an interview.

28:34.779 --> 28:38.885
Protecting ships against
Somali pirates. Shield security.

28:43.240 --> 28:44.996
Roberto Savio.

28:45.032 --> 28:48.232
Died practising auto-erotic asphyxiation.

28:48.670 --> 28:51.145
- Allegedly.
- Approximately the same day

28:51.169 --> 28:53.418
and then two kilometres away, you show up.

28:54.476 --> 28:56.243
Oh, well, um...

28:58.337 --> 28:59.989
um, I...

29:00.109 --> 29:02.237
was seeing Maria, and...

29:02.567 --> 29:04.688
she's probably still in bed.

29:05.151 --> 29:06.504
Call her.

29:08.198 --> 29:10.167
Why use false number plates?

29:11.106 --> 29:14.233
If you knew how many
speeding tickets I get.

29:14.234 --> 29:16.776
Where were you on Wednesday at 9:13 a.m.?

29:19.322 --> 29:20.645
Flying through Vienna.

29:20.651 --> 29:21.851
Family visit.

29:21.864 --> 29:23.528
Your bike have a flat tire?

29:23.529 --> 29:24.906
You saw Maria.

29:25.661 --> 29:27.635
She likes the mile high thrill.

29:27.947 --> 29:29.380
If you know what I mean.

29:37.293 --> 29:39.615
- You OK?
- Um, well...

29:39.846 --> 29:42.394
For a moment, I thought
you recognized this one.

29:43.716 --> 29:46.654
Ah, I don't recognize any of them.

29:46.885 --> 29:48.476
Matthias Schutte.

29:49.247 --> 29:51.009
Who are you working for?

29:51.306 --> 29:53.267
I got nothing more to say.

29:54.003 --> 29:55.387
I'm listening.

29:55.507 --> 29:59.016
I checked. Sattler was on
that flight, just like he said.

29:59.017 --> 30:00.532
He can't have killed Matthias Schutte.

30:00.533 --> 30:02.785
Something tells me his
other alibis will stick.

30:02.786 --> 30:04.735
You can't fake that kind of itinerary.

30:04.736 --> 30:06.955
I mean, a job interview,
a compliant girlfriend.

30:06.967 --> 30:09.917
Yet, evidence still points to
Sattler killing Muller and Savio.

30:09.941 --> 30:11.166
- Nothing conclusive.
- Yeah.

30:11.186 --> 30:14.250
Well, how many other hitmen were on the
vicinity on the day they were killed.

30:14.532 --> 30:16.434
Somebody pushed Schutte out of the window,

30:16.435 --> 30:18.052
the question is obviously "who?".

30:18.294 --> 30:19.765
You let Sattler go.

30:20.501 --> 30:21.701
He's a professional.

30:21.753 --> 30:23.095
His alibis stand up.

30:23.122 --> 30:24.518
There's nothing to gain by

30:24.542 --> 30:25.896
sitting it out, and

30:26.142 --> 30:28.562
hoping he falters. Hm?

30:28.563 --> 30:29.763
OK.

30:30.883 --> 30:32.911
Arabela, grab Luke,

30:32.996 --> 30:34.479
I want you to tail Sattler.

30:34.486 --> 30:35.735
Find out what he's up to.

30:36.021 --> 30:37.221
Yep.

30:38.134 --> 30:39.519
Let's go through it again.

30:40.931 --> 30:43.398
_

30:43.399 --> 30:46.533
_

31:14.688 --> 31:15.895
Anything?

31:16.765 --> 31:18.930
Yeah. Petric.

31:18.931 --> 31:20.996
That rent boy Luke and Arabela found.

31:20.997 --> 31:22.979
Yeah, I heard he's on a
better rate than we are.

31:22.980 --> 31:26.162
Er... $100,000 were transferred to Petric

31:26.163 --> 31:28.193
from an account in the
British Virgin Islands,

31:28.194 --> 31:30.927
at 8:40 on the morning of Matthias' death.

31:30.928 --> 31:33.193
8:40? That's after he left the hotel.

31:33.486 --> 31:35.317
Yeah, but before he was pushed.

31:35.410 --> 31:37.918
Petric would have been on a
taxi on his way to the airport.

31:37.919 --> 31:40.934
Well, maybe he met the killer
and gave them Matthias' room card.

31:40.935 --> 31:43.800
No. His wife said
Matthias answered the door.

31:45.156 --> 31:46.781
Do you know where the money's from?

31:47.212 --> 31:48.579
In a minute.

31:52.072 --> 31:53.272
Here we go.

31:53.669 --> 31:57.173
Purity Construction. Released
by a Mr. Edgar Horvet.

32:01.242 --> 32:02.460
_

32:03.635 --> 32:05.791
He's definitely on his way to Horvet's.

32:06.724 --> 32:08.504
Stay as close as you can.

32:11.149 --> 32:13.477
Damn it, Horvet still isn't answering.

32:13.478 --> 32:15.172
Luke, step on it.

32:45.574 --> 32:47.080
Hands where I can see them!

32:47.131 --> 32:48.334
Hand up!

32:53.916 --> 32:55.391
Shit! Argh!

32:56.600 --> 32:58.160
Hands behind your back.

32:58.229 --> 32:59.456
Give me your hand!

33:00.000 --> 33:02.492
- Clear?
- Yeah. Fine, move it!

33:08.808 --> 33:10.008
Hey.

33:11.392 --> 33:12.592
Hey!

33:13.379 --> 33:14.651
Sebastian,

33:14.903 --> 33:17.341
I need an ambulance to my GPS signal.

33:18.298 --> 33:20.239
- Is he OK?
- Barely.

33:20.857 --> 33:24.228
_

33:24.229 --> 33:25.988
_

33:29.445 --> 33:31.948
I don't know how to say
this, so, I'm just...

33:32.198 --> 33:33.661
going to be direct.

33:33.991 --> 33:36.722
Are you aware that your
husband kept secrets from you?

33:38.014 --> 33:39.323
You mean...

33:40.427 --> 33:42.701
did I know that he slept with men?

33:46.831 --> 33:48.824
For a long time I didn't.

33:49.594 --> 33:50.868
But then we...

33:51.826 --> 33:54.380
we stopped making love.

33:55.440 --> 33:56.745
He blamed work.

33:56.806 --> 33:58.274
Always too tired.

33:59.359 --> 34:01.438
But the paranoia made me spy,

34:02.456 --> 34:04.339
I'd doubt his every move.

34:06.339 --> 34:09.130
I started opening his
personal bank statements.

34:09.136 --> 34:10.335
And all the...

34:10.502 --> 34:13.202
cash withdrawals made my head spin.

34:13.938 --> 34:15.877
I prayed he was a gambler.

34:16.364 --> 34:17.730
Taking drugs.

34:18.534 --> 34:21.303
And then I... found the
pills for depression.

34:21.540 --> 34:22.904
His excuse

34:23.435 --> 34:25.257
barely made sense.

34:25.453 --> 34:28.300
But he promised that
depression was under control.

34:28.971 --> 34:30.170
So, ah...

34:33.681 --> 34:36.697
I paid an expert

34:36.818 --> 34:38.301
to search his computer.

34:38.355 --> 34:40.447
And the websites made me realize

34:40.514 --> 34:43.554
it... had nothing to do with me.

34:44.920 --> 34:47.143
I wasn't even equipped to fight it.

34:49.563 --> 34:51.246
I'm very sorry.

34:52.965 --> 34:54.978
He was my soul mate.

34:59.091 --> 35:01.550
I know I should have
told you before, but...

35:02.870 --> 35:05.585
I suppose the reason I didn't was bec...

35:06.582 --> 35:08.435
because I knew

35:08.734 --> 35:11.261
he wouldn't want anyone to know.

35:12.023 --> 35:13.532
I understand.

35:18.576 --> 35:20.252
Can we talk, please?

35:20.895 --> 35:22.095
Sure.

35:22.661 --> 35:25.038
Luke, I am your partner

35:25.074 --> 35:27.741
- and your friend.
- Friends don't lie to friends.

35:27.781 --> 35:29.623
How did I lie to you?

35:29.624 --> 35:31.265
Come on, Arabela.

35:31.802 --> 35:33.002
Really?

35:33.451 --> 35:35.105
You didn't want me to
know you had a girlfriend.

35:35.106 --> 35:36.472
And you don't approve.

35:36.831 --> 35:40.381
Don't approve? Look, I couldn't
care less who sleeps with who.

35:40.962 --> 35:42.792
But you knew how I felt about you.

35:43.415 --> 35:45.475
- How you felt?
- Yeah.

35:46.206 --> 35:47.419
You knew.

35:48.503 --> 35:51.843
I'm sorry, I... I just, I
don't feel that way about you.

35:51.854 --> 35:54.222
So, how do you explain the
way that you've looked at me,

35:54.223 --> 35:56.279
flirted with me, I'm not wrong about this.

35:56.280 --> 35:57.515
Yes, you are.

35:57.516 --> 35:59.391
You really really are.

36:02.722 --> 36:03.922
OK.

36:04.795 --> 36:05.995
Well...

36:07.007 --> 36:09.555
I don't know if we can
work together any more.

36:11.150 --> 36:12.388
So, um,

36:13.103 --> 36:14.681
you're just gonna quit?

36:15.261 --> 36:16.791
Move back to London?

36:17.297 --> 36:18.888
I said I don't know.

36:20.551 --> 36:21.751
I don't.

36:29.860 --> 36:32.761
Look at what we found
on Edgar Horvet's phone.

36:39.339 --> 36:42.454
Hundred grand for a video of
you and Matthias in action,

36:42.460 --> 36:45.355
sent from you to Horvet the
minute you left the hotel.

36:52.854 --> 36:54.890
Blackmail's five years minimum.

36:55.482 --> 36:58.292
Longer if we prove a
connection to Matthias' death.

36:59.268 --> 37:00.956
He was such a sweetheart.

37:02.577 --> 37:05.216
And why would I have anything
to do with killing him?

37:07.996 --> 37:09.731
Why don't you tell me what happened then?

37:11.431 --> 37:12.894
Last week...

37:15.260 --> 37:17.193
last week, Horvet turned up at the hotel

37:17.194 --> 37:20.635
and tried to bribe Matthias to keep
quiet about the stupid pollution.

37:20.958 --> 37:22.433
How did you find out?

37:22.661 --> 37:24.386
I was hiding in the bathroom.

37:24.706 --> 37:27.120
Matthias shoved me outside,
but I heard everything.

37:27.735 --> 37:30.276
And, Matthias wouldn't take the money?

37:30.454 --> 37:33.167
- I told him he was crazy.
- So,

37:33.380 --> 37:37.184
you approached Horvet and
suggested a way to convince him.

37:37.226 --> 37:40.432
Do you know how many nights I'd have
to work to make that kind of money?

37:42.078 --> 37:43.797
You have to understand,

37:45.338 --> 37:46.648
my clients,

37:46.930 --> 37:48.911
they're not all sweethearts.

37:49.666 --> 37:51.830
So, you told Matthias that

37:51.842 --> 37:55.018
Horvet would expose him publicly
if he didn't recommend the dam?

37:55.112 --> 37:57.131
Yes, and he got so depressed,

37:57.401 --> 37:59.725
went to a really dark place, you know.

38:00.247 --> 38:02.807
And this guy, Horvet, was
like his closest friend.

38:02.927 --> 38:05.549
Matthias couldn't believe
he'd blackmail him like that.

38:05.745 --> 38:07.665
And did he agree to change his report?

38:07.707 --> 38:09.585
Obviously not.

38:13.107 --> 38:16.161
Listen, you've got to believe me!
I never thought they'd kill him.

38:20.135 --> 38:21.866
So you blackmailed him?

38:22.847 --> 38:24.103
Do you know

38:24.115 --> 38:27.083
how many livelihoods are
dependant on that contract?

38:27.376 --> 38:30.253
More than the number of
miscarriages the water would cause?

38:30.290 --> 38:32.978
We know you hired Sattler to

38:32.999 --> 38:37.224
kill Muller and Savio, but who did
you hire to kill your best friend?

38:38.564 --> 38:40.167
I told you before,

38:42.184 --> 38:44.223
I might have blackmailed him,

38:45.336 --> 38:48.066
but nothing could make me kill Matthias.

38:48.357 --> 38:49.557
Nothing.

38:52.093 --> 38:54.751
Drunken fall, wayward sex game,

38:54.769 --> 38:56.359
suicide in a car,

38:56.360 --> 38:57.762
it's a trusted pattern.

38:57.763 --> 39:02.090
smear the character, cast dispersion
on credibility, Sattler's a pro.

39:02.210 --> 39:03.410
Was a pro.

39:03.424 --> 39:06.880
Now defunct. He has confessed
to the murders of Savio,

39:07.000 --> 39:08.200
and Muller,

39:08.286 --> 39:11.567
and the attempted murder of Horvet.

39:14.203 --> 39:15.416
OK.

39:16.577 --> 39:19.692
We're still stuck on who pushed
Schutte out of the window, though.

39:19.708 --> 39:22.524
My money says that Horvet
had another hitman waiting,

39:22.561 --> 39:23.816
ready to go.

39:23.999 --> 39:26.175
Guess what just came in from Savio's wife?

39:26.212 --> 39:29.320
Sent to her cottage by Matthias
on the morning he was killed.

39:29.321 --> 39:30.894
It's the completed report.

39:31.148 --> 39:34.659
It contains information from Muller
that he didn't dare to keep on the cloud.

39:35.013 --> 39:36.251
"Dear Clara,

39:36.252 --> 39:39.712
if you or Savio don't hear from
me before this letter arrives,

39:40.668 --> 39:42.240
I've been murdered.

39:42.448 --> 39:45.294
I've tried to call, but nobody is at home.

39:45.349 --> 39:48.671
Jurgen had an 'accident'

39:48.677 --> 39:51.164
and I fear for Savio too.

39:51.221 --> 39:54.086
If Savio is still alive,
hand this report to him.

39:54.338 --> 39:58.107
If Savio is no longer with you, take
the report to the police in Munich.

39:58.209 --> 40:00.934
And ask them to investigate my murder.

40:01.030 --> 40:02.294
Matthias."

40:02.295 --> 40:04.537
He doesn't say who he thinks, ah,

40:04.538 --> 40:06.224
is going to kill him maybe, or, ah...

40:06.225 --> 40:09.175
- Wouldn't that be nice?
- He had to know it was Horvet.

40:09.199 --> 40:11.649
No, then why not just name him?

40:18.713 --> 40:19.913
Hey.

40:24.370 --> 40:27.832
Are you sure that your husband
didn't know that you knew his secret?

40:30.316 --> 40:32.534
I sometimes wondered.

40:33.132 --> 40:34.540
But, no.

40:35.179 --> 40:37.349
What was his mood last time you spoke?

40:37.634 --> 40:39.036
He was down.

40:40.306 --> 40:42.580
As I said, he had his
pills for his depression,

40:42.586 --> 40:44.658
but he didn't really take them.

40:44.956 --> 40:46.853
Did anything come in the post?

40:48.241 --> 40:49.711
How did you know?

40:51.850 --> 40:54.167
Yes, I have it with me.

40:58.908 --> 41:00.279
What does it say?

41:00.292 --> 41:02.961
- If you don't mind my asking.
- How could I mind

41:02.998 --> 41:04.924
after the secrets we've shared?

41:10.165 --> 41:11.817
"Dear Anne,

41:13.362 --> 41:15.294
cherish our past,

41:16.827 --> 41:18.948
love our children,

41:19.168 --> 41:21.197
and always look to the future.

41:22.904 --> 41:26.158
You're still the most
beautiful woman I ever saw.

41:27.810 --> 41:29.888
Your loving Matthias."

41:45.493 --> 41:47.523
We must have missed something.

41:47.762 --> 41:50.129
I'm gonna head back down to
Zagreb, see what we can find.

41:50.130 --> 41:51.815
No, we're not.

41:52.508 --> 41:55.080
- What are you doing?
- Horvet and Sattler have confessed

41:55.098 --> 41:57.256
to the killing of Muller and Savio.

41:57.269 --> 41:59.981
Good work. They're going
away for a long time.

41:59.982 --> 42:01.423
This case isn't closed.

42:01.424 --> 42:03.241
We still haven't found Schutte's murderer.

42:03.242 --> 42:06.282
We'll give our information to the
Croatian police. They'll take it from here.

42:06.283 --> 42:09.149
- Ah, I think that we need to...
- Our unit has cases,

42:09.179 --> 42:11.057
backed up. We're done here.

42:11.146 --> 42:13.452
My decision is final. Trust me.

42:22.692 --> 42:24.039
OK, boss.

42:36.600 --> 42:37.874
Yes?

42:42.792 --> 42:47.162
The Croatian Parliament has suspended
the vote on the project until

42:47.391 --> 42:50.219
they have fully studied the new report.

42:53.976 --> 42:55.457
Were you aware that

42:55.500 --> 42:58.267
the continued existence of this unit

42:59.029 --> 43:01.473
depends on our success rating?

43:01.866 --> 43:03.298
I am aware.

43:03.887 --> 43:06.155
Then it's a very big decision, to

43:06.940 --> 43:08.775
shelve a case like this.

43:09.037 --> 43:11.859
Not every case gets
solved in a matter of days.

43:12.602 --> 43:14.876
How is Herr Schutte's widow?

43:15.345 --> 43:18.277
She appears to be coming
to terms with her loss.

43:18.512 --> 43:19.712
Mm-hm.

43:20.538 --> 43:23.634
If he'd refused to make
changes in his report,

43:23.754 --> 43:26.115
his 'friend'

43:26.157 --> 43:28.528
was going to expose his sexuality.

43:28.541 --> 43:29.741
Yes.

43:29.742 --> 43:31.704
He battled with depression.

43:33.108 --> 43:34.480
It must have been a

43:34.955 --> 43:37.284
very black morning for him.

43:37.625 --> 43:39.155
Dealing with the

43:39.275 --> 43:41.941
betrayal of the man he
thought was his best friend.

43:42.203 --> 43:44.177
Well, I think that it was.

43:44.433 --> 43:46.018
He knew that the

43:46.073 --> 43:49.236
geologist, Muller, had ostensibly,

43:49.675 --> 43:51.784
fallen from his balcony

43:52.522 --> 43:54.686
but he knew that it was a murder.

43:55.380 --> 44:00.305
And he surmised that it was probably a
murder that would never be recognized.

44:01.237 --> 44:03.601
According to his letter, yeah.

44:03.602 --> 44:04.949
But he knew that

44:05.528 --> 44:08.240
if he were to fall from his balcony,

44:08.789 --> 44:11.080
and to make it look like a murder,

44:11.617 --> 44:13.226
then that would

44:13.346 --> 44:15.592
provide the police with a pattern.

44:15.915 --> 44:18.237
And they might go back and

44:18.357 --> 44:20.560
revisit the death of Muller.

44:21.553 --> 44:23.254
Then find the

44:23.648 --> 44:24.964
killers.

44:25.887 --> 44:27.495
I suppose.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.251
Did you know that

44:31.918 --> 44:34.567
certain insurance policies

44:35.267 --> 44:37.053
do not pay out

44:37.872 --> 44:39.943
if the death is a suicide?

44:39.944 --> 44:41.144
Hmm.

44:41.620 --> 44:43.978
I've heard that's the case, yeah.

44:43.984 --> 44:45.776
But if he were murdered,

44:46.587 --> 44:48.708
then his wife and his children

44:48.828 --> 44:50.598
would be taken care of.
