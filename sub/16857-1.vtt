00:44.071 --> 00:45.991
Would you get the fuckin' coffee
and let's go.

00:59.783 --> 01:01.382
This ain't exactly Brazil.

01:01.383 --> 01:03.750
I coulda pissed ya
a fuckin' cup by now.

01:09.063 --> 01:11.974
Hey! You're out
of chocolate mac.

01:12.230 --> 01:14.822
Sorry.
No chocolate macadamia.

01:14.823 --> 01:16.711
You would please
have something else?

01:16.807 --> 01:18.631
Fuckin'hazelnut--

01:30.152 --> 01:32.037
That will be $ 1 .08.

01:32.072 --> 01:34.917
That sign says
"All Coffee 69 Cents."

01:34.952 --> 01:37.367
I am very sorry,
but that is a 44-ounce cup,

01:37.402 --> 01:39.783
and the largest
coffee cup is 20 ounces.

01:39.818 --> 01:41.703
Therefore,
I must charge you...

01:41.738 --> 01:43.588
99 cents, plus tax--

01:43.623 --> 01:45.543
the price of
a large fountain drink.

01:45.544 --> 01:48.424
That's bullshit. That sign says
"Coffee All Sizes,"

01:48.459 --> 01:51.143
not "All Sizes Up to 20 Ounces."

01:51.304 --> 01:54.152
I am humbly sorry, but you
must pay 99 cents plus tax...

01:54.248 --> 01:55.175
for that cup.

01:55.431 --> 01:57.127
Just pay
the bitch the $ 1 .08...

01:57.352 --> 01:59.240
and let's get the
fuck out of here.

01:59.464 --> 02:00.871
All right.

02:00.872 --> 02:03.752
This is bullshit. just give me
my fuckin Snackie Cake.

02:03.787 --> 02:06.536
I am sorry.
I cannot do that.

02:06.632 --> 02:08.007
That is only available...

02:08.042 --> 02:09.383
with the 20-ounce coffee.

02:09.512 --> 02:10.437
That is not a 20-ounce coffee.

02:10.472 --> 02:13.352
This bitch is gettin'
on my nerves, man. Forget it.

02:13.353 --> 02:15.273
-Just give him the fuckin' danish.
- That sign says...

02:15.308 --> 02:16.584
"Free Snackie Cake."

02:16.776 --> 02:19.143
I paid $ 1.08 for my coffee.
I want my free Snackie Cake.

02:19.144 --> 02:21.032
I cannot do that.

02:22.024 --> 02:24.616
Here. take it.

02:24.873 --> 02:27.768
That's apple cinnamon.
I wanted cream cheese.

02:27.803 --> 02:30.664
Fuck's sake. Pay her
the money and let's go.

02:30.665 --> 02:34.440
Either of you got
something smaller than a Ben?

02:43.113 --> 02:44.073
I'm sorry.

02:44.233 --> 02:47.784
I cannot accept
any monies over a $20 bill.

02:50.441 --> 02:52.808
- That's it.
- I should not sell it to you, anyway...

02:53.065 --> 02:55.624
As that cup is very hot
and might burn you.

02:55.625 --> 02:56.553
You are very strange.

02:56.714 --> 02:58.505
I'm going
to call the police.

02:58.540 --> 03:00.393
Fuck this.

03:06.185 --> 03:08.070
Fuck me.

03:08.105 --> 03:10.025
Give me a smock.

03:24.394 --> 03:25.354
How you doin' tonight?

03:25.389 --> 03:26.730
Fine.

03:26.922 --> 03:28.233
How about yourself?

03:28.234 --> 03:30.025
I'm doin'okay.

03:30.154 --> 03:32.074
Need a cup of coffee, though.

03:34.763 --> 03:35.946
Hmm... raspberry blend.

03:45.194 --> 03:46.505
It's on the house.

03:46.506 --> 03:47.466
You sure?

03:47.562 --> 03:49.225
Hey, man, here you are...

03:49.355 --> 03:51.275
out chasing bad guys
at 4:00 in the morning...

03:51.310 --> 03:53.195
while I'm sitting here
like a duck--

03:53.230 --> 03:55.019
It's the least I can do.

03:55.115 --> 03:55.723
I appreciate it.

03:57.035 --> 03:58.955
Smell something funny?

04:00.331 --> 04:02.794
Yeah, one of our coolers went down.

04:02.795 --> 04:04.715
Spoiled a lot of shit.

04:04.939 --> 04:06.600
Sorry.

04:06.635 --> 04:08.555
Hey, man, if you can stand it...

04:08.590 --> 04:10.508
it don't bother me none.

04:10.543 --> 04:12.426
You got to work in it.

04:12.427 --> 04:14.315
Mind if I, uh...

04:14.347 --> 04:15.339
ask you a question?

04:15.563 --> 04:17.195
Go ahead, officer.

04:20.875 --> 04:24.906
Tell me. who do you like better,
Picard or Kirk?

04:24.907 --> 04:26.827
Oh, there's no question about it.

04:26.862 --> 04:27.755
Kirk.

04:27.756 --> 04:29.003
You bet.

04:29.259 --> 04:31.595
You got to respect a man
who can fuck a green bitch...

04:31.852 --> 04:34.475
and destroy a whole civilization
all in 60 minutes.

04:35.563 --> 04:37.355
Good night.

04:41.716 --> 04:43.636
Thought we had a problem.

04:46.956 --> 04:49.836
I almost forgot--
my free Snackie Cake.

05:16.844 --> 05:19.596
- Hello?
- This is the operator.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.516
I have a collect call from Nick.

05:21.517 --> 05:24.397
- Who?
- From a "Nick." Will you accept charges?

05:24.432 --> 05:25.357
Yeah, I'll take it.

05:25.392 --> 05:26.317
Go ahead, sir.

05:28.269 --> 05:29.229
Nick?

05:29.264 --> 05:30.189
Case?

05:32.109 --> 05:35.949
Look, uh, I'm coming through
Houston tomorrow morning.

05:35.984 --> 05:38.829
I was wondering
if I might come see you.

05:38.864 --> 05:40.749
Oh, I don't know, bro. Why?

05:40.813 --> 05:42.668
Things have changed.

05:42.669 --> 05:45.482
I'm getting married.

05:45.517 --> 05:47.501
I was hoping I could stay
a couple days, you know?

05:47.789 --> 05:50.317
Catch up?

06:15.310 --> 06:17.486
Jesus.
Aww!

06:21.070 --> 06:23.358
What do you want me to say?
"Sorry, bro, my wife's..."

06:23.393 --> 06:25.646
"going to be a little tired
when she gets home tonight."

06:25.838 --> 06:26.763
"Here's 20 bucks."

06:26.798 --> 06:27.949
"There's a La Quinta
up the highway."

06:28.206 --> 06:29.678
I thought maybe you'd
want him to meet me.

06:29.713 --> 06:30.958
If he's such a good friend,

06:31.182 --> 06:32.558
why haven't I heard
about him before, hmm?

06:32.593 --> 06:34.443
I told you.

06:34.478 --> 06:38.318
I was kind of in the wrong path
when I was in L.A.

06:38.319 --> 06:41.199
I chose to get
my shit together. He didn't.

06:41.326 --> 06:44.078
What time is it?
Oh, shit!

06:44.079 --> 06:46.974
I'm going to miss my plane.
I got to go. Bye.

06:47.009 --> 06:49.870
- What about breakfast?
- No. sorry. No time.

06:49.905 --> 06:51.214
Okay--

06:51.438 --> 06:54.670
Chris, don't plan anything
tomorrow night. It's opening night.

06:54.671 --> 06:58.511
I planned dinner
with Allen tomorrow night.

06:58.546 --> 07:00.396
Why didn't you remind me?

07:00.431 --> 07:02.319
Chris, i've been working
on this club for eight months.

07:02.354 --> 07:04.239
He's the C.E.O.
I have to be there.

07:04.495 --> 07:07.023
Every critic in town will be there.
We can't miss it.

07:07.119 --> 07:10.607
We'll work something out. Just don't
forget your appointment with Dr.Jarvis.

07:10.863 --> 07:13.199
Casey, you know
this adoption is--

07:13.423 --> 07:14.591
Yeah, I know.

07:14.626 --> 07:15.724
It'll be fine.

07:15.759 --> 07:17.679
You want me to take you?

07:17.714 --> 07:19.564
No. I'll drive.

07:19.599 --> 07:22.479
I'm taking the Mustang.

07:22.480 --> 07:23.405
I love you.

07:23.440 --> 07:24.943
I love you, too. Bye.

08:03.792 --> 08:05.712
Turn around and put
your hands on the wall.

08:05.747 --> 08:07.597
What?

08:07.632 --> 08:12.432
Turn around... and put
your hands on that wall.

08:12.467 --> 08:14.352
You're kidding, right?

08:17.232 --> 08:19.120
You're not going to try
and fuck me are you?

08:20.081 --> 08:22.926
You wish.

08:22.961 --> 08:26.161
This isn't exactly how
I envisioned our reunion going.

08:26.385 --> 08:29.681
Oh, God... damn!

08:30.641 --> 08:32.525
You had me going.

08:32.561 --> 08:34.481
Goddamn, good to see you.

08:35.441 --> 08:36.465
Come on.

08:36.784 --> 08:38.528
Finally, I ended up in Texas.

08:38.563 --> 08:40.272
That was about a year ago.

08:40.273 --> 08:42.513
I had a little money,
got into mineral leases,

08:42.738 --> 08:44.078
And I've been, uh...

08:44.113 --> 08:46.001
working between
here and L.A. ever since.

08:46.226 --> 08:48.913
Looks like we both escaped.

08:50.289 --> 08:51.792
No shit.

08:52.753 --> 08:54.638
Look at you.

08:54.673 --> 08:57.841
You look like that wolf
that got taken in as a pet--

08:58.065 --> 09:00.080
all dumb and domesticated.

09:02.609 --> 09:04.753
You want a beer?

09:05.010 --> 09:07.121
When's the last time you had
a beer at 8:00 in the morning?

09:07.122 --> 09:10.002
About three and a half years ago.

09:10.037 --> 09:10.962
Well, let me get them.

09:11.218 --> 09:11.954
No, I'll get them.

09:12.178 --> 09:13.841
Sit down, I'm closer.

09:13.842 --> 09:15.762
That woman's got you
trained, doesn't she?

09:15.797 --> 09:16.722
They're not in there.

09:16.755 --> 09:18.642
They're in the fridge in the garage.

09:18.675 --> 09:20.595
I'll get them.

09:22.515 --> 09:23.954
Two fridges.

09:24.242 --> 09:26.354
Welcome to suburbia.

09:29.235 --> 09:31.155
What the fuck?

09:31.190 --> 09:32.080
What?

09:32.115 --> 09:33.842
What the hell is this?

09:34.035 --> 09:34.962
It's Soy Moo.

09:34.963 --> 09:35.923
Yeah, I can see that.

09:35.958 --> 09:37.808
What's it for?

09:37.843 --> 09:39.763
That's a milk substitute.

09:40.723 --> 09:43.059
We're very health conscious.

09:43.347 --> 09:44.563
There's no meat...

09:46.483 --> 09:49.715
no dairy... nothing.

09:51.283 --> 09:52.243
You're kidding.

09:52.278 --> 09:53.168
Nope.

09:53.203 --> 09:54.579
Three happy years...

09:54.835 --> 09:57.042
of veggie burgers and acidophilus.

09:57.043 --> 09:58.995
Those are scrambled eggs.

09:58.996 --> 10:01.651
Scrambled Tofutti.

10:02.836 --> 10:03.859
Fuck, dude, Rod Serling's...

10:04.148 --> 10:06.676
going to step out
of that fridge any second.

10:11.476 --> 10:12.915
Nick?

10:16.243 --> 10:17.168
What?

10:17.203 --> 10:19.123
Does that look like
a trash can to you?

10:19.124 --> 10:22.004
Oh. sorry, bro.

10:22.964 --> 10:24.849
Under the sink, man.

10:24.884 --> 10:26.804
So you're an architect, huh?

10:26.836 --> 10:27.955
Yep.

10:28.180 --> 10:29.556
- You're good.
- Nah.

10:29.684 --> 10:31.604
No, seriously,
you're really fucking good.

10:31.639 --> 10:33.204
Thanks.

10:35.476 --> 10:36.947
She know?

10:41.620 --> 10:45.076
Not... even... a clue.

10:47.957 --> 10:49.842
Never.

10:49.877 --> 10:52.724
I fly out tonight for "Paree."

10:52.759 --> 10:53.748
Yeah, that's right.

10:53.973 --> 10:56.628
You're fixing to tie
that knot yourself.

10:56.853 --> 10:59.409
Who's the lucky girl?

10:59.444 --> 11:01.364
Aw, just some French chick.

11:02.324 --> 11:04.947
Man, you sound head over heels.

11:05.557 --> 11:07.090
Nervous, I guess.

11:07.125 --> 11:09.045
Nothing wrong
with living in France.

11:09.080 --> 11:10.677
No extradition.

11:10.869 --> 11:12.884
What?

11:12.981 --> 11:14.802
I'm just kidding.

11:14.837 --> 11:17.748
Say, I've got some errands to run.

11:17.783 --> 11:20.660
You mind if I borrow your car?

11:20.949 --> 11:23.477
Help yourself.

11:23.478 --> 11:26.358
Hell, I got a floor plan
that was due last Monday.

11:26.393 --> 11:27.283
I'm not going anywhere.

11:27.318 --> 11:32.085
Let's throw your bags
into the guest, uh... bedroom here.

11:36.885 --> 11:38.196
Fuck, bro.

11:39.765 --> 11:42.645
It's really good seeing you.

11:54.326 --> 11:55.125
Ooh!

11:55.158 --> 11:57.078
Beamer. Nice.

11:57.174 --> 12:00.006
- Insurance is in the glove box.
- Got it.

12:00.041 --> 12:02.838
And the, uh,
spare is in the... trunk.

12:02.873 --> 12:03.815
No problem.

12:03.850 --> 12:04.758
Thanks.

12:04.759 --> 12:06.486
Don't mention it.

12:07.606 --> 12:08.838
It's a fucking station wagon!

12:08.873 --> 12:10.070
It's a fucking station wagon!

12:25.846 --> 12:30.646
- Hey, what can I get you?
- Just coffee.

12:37.399 --> 12:39.286
Hi.

12:41.559 --> 12:42.679
Have a seat.

12:42.999 --> 12:45.110
Thanks.

12:45.335 --> 12:47.926
What can I do for you?

12:49.847 --> 12:52.727
You, uh, look pretty tired.

12:54.647 --> 12:56.567
Well, it's 1 :00 in the morning.
I can't imagine why.

12:56.983 --> 12:59.446
Well, you're kind of a dick,
aren't you?

13:01.367 --> 13:02.292
I'm sorry.

13:02.327 --> 13:05.207
I guess I just haven't
acclimatized yet.

13:05.242 --> 13:06.231
I was in L.A.

13:06.519 --> 13:08.919
Los Angeles? Oh.

13:09.080 --> 13:11.319
Took some time off.

13:11.512 --> 13:16.759
You know, for six weeks
you come in here...

13:16.760 --> 13:18.645
every night--
alone, I might add--

13:18.680 --> 13:21.399
and you sit here,
and you study for hours.

13:21.560 --> 13:24.407
And every night I wait on you,
and you don't even notice me.

13:24.408 --> 13:25.880
How come?

13:26.136 --> 13:29.207
It's not that I--
I mean, I noticed.

13:29.208 --> 13:31.093
I mean, you-- You're--

13:31.128 --> 13:33.144
- Fuck, I'm just trying to get through this.
- So, here it is,

13:33.368 --> 13:35.927
Friday night, and here you sit.

13:35.928 --> 13:37.208
And I'm thinking either, one:

13:37.433 --> 13:39.560
You know, you're just a total geek.

13:39.595 --> 13:41.653
Or, two: you don't have any friends.

13:41.688 --> 13:44.088
And you don't
look like a geek, so, uh...

13:44.123 --> 13:46.488
I was wondering
if you'd like to go...

13:46.523 --> 13:48.280
uh, get some breakfast?

13:50.201 --> 13:52.201
You don't even know me.

13:52.236 --> 13:55.138
Oh. uh... I'm Christine.

13:55.173 --> 13:58.006
- You are?
- Casey.

13:58.041 --> 14:01.048
Casey. Casey. Okay, good.

14:01.337 --> 14:03.000
Wait.

14:03.257 --> 14:04.920
What?

14:05.177 --> 14:07.608
Tell me, why is it
so fucking difficult?

14:07.609 --> 14:08.569
What?

14:08.697 --> 14:13.368
This relationship.

14:13.369 --> 14:15.289
Why is it so... difficult?

14:15.324 --> 14:17.174
I'm busting my ass here...

14:17.209 --> 14:19.257
to be the perfect husband for you,

14:19.481 --> 14:22.297
and the harder I work,
the less you care.

14:22.554 --> 14:24.854
I love you, and...

14:24.889 --> 14:28.761
you care more about
your career than you care about me.

14:28.762 --> 14:29.882
Casey, I do love you...

14:30.105 --> 14:32.601
but you are boring
the shit out of me.

14:32.602 --> 14:35.609
You are working so fucking hard
to be what you think I want...

14:35.898 --> 14:37.593
instead of giving me what I need.

14:37.818 --> 14:40.281
Quit trying so hard.
Why don't you just be yourself?

14:40.282 --> 14:43.578
I don't want
Fred MacMurray, Casey.

14:43.802 --> 14:45.049
I want you.

14:45.050 --> 14:48.138
You, the cocky,
determined guy, full of life.

14:48.173 --> 14:51.226
- Full of--
- You wouldn't like who I am.

14:51.482 --> 14:53.689
I married you!

14:53.690 --> 14:54.810
I love you.

14:55.066 --> 14:57.306
I don't want
to lose you, Christine.

14:59.450 --> 15:01.370
Christine!

16:05.595 --> 16:10.491
There is nothing in that case
but a pack of legal documents.

16:11.868 --> 16:14.332
Maybe a box of condoms.

16:14.333 --> 16:16.253
That's it.

16:30.685 --> 16:31.580
Yeah?

16:31.709 --> 16:33.564
I just want to know one thing.

16:33.565 --> 16:35.997
What kind
of fucking drugs are you on?

16:38.044 --> 16:39.292
What?

16:39.293 --> 16:42.138
I want to know what kind
of fucking drugs you were on...

16:42.173 --> 16:46.013
to make you think you could
bring fucking smack into my house!

16:46.048 --> 16:50.236
- That briefcase was locked, Case.
- Yeah? Sue me!

16:50.557 --> 16:52.698
That wasn't very trusting
of you to go through my shit.

16:52.733 --> 16:55.613
This ain't exactly me borrowing
your trading cards here, Beave.

16:55.648 --> 16:58.493
You brought shit into my house!
Into my home!

16:58.494 --> 17:00.429
Which I invited you
into as my fucking guest!

17:00.464 --> 17:02.330
You know what they did
in ancient Rome...

17:02.365 --> 17:04.701
when a visitor violated
somebody's hospitality?

17:04.925 --> 17:09.085
They cut off his dick and they
nailed it to the fucking gate!

17:09.119 --> 17:11.930
See, this is why
I didn't want to tell you.

17:11.964 --> 17:14.813
I knew that you would have very
little enthusiasm for this deal.

17:14.814 --> 17:16.733
I had a little business
to finish up in Houston,

17:16.769 --> 17:18.618
and I wanted to tell you
adios face to face.

17:18.654 --> 17:21.534
I want you to pedal your ass
back here, pick up your shit...

17:21.569 --> 17:22.493
get the fuck out of my house.

17:22.529 --> 17:24.378
No can do, buddy.

17:24.414 --> 17:28.219
I appreciate your situation,
but I told you...

17:28.253 --> 17:30.174
I got a little unfinished
business to take care of.

17:30.209 --> 17:35.261
- So what?
- A little unfinished business.

17:35.550 --> 17:36.859
If you're not
back here in 1 5 minutes,

17:36.894 --> 17:40.765
you're going to have to pick up your
shit from the police evidence room.

17:40.766 --> 17:41.691
And tell 'em what?

17:41.726 --> 17:43.646
Your ex-partner
just happened to stop by...

17:43.681 --> 17:44.766
with a basketful of goodies...

17:45.022 --> 17:48.381
and you felt it was your moral
obligation to turn him in?

17:48.446 --> 17:50.366
- I don't think so.
- Look, you lame piece of shit.

17:50.401 --> 17:52.894
I am having
a little bit of trouble...

17:53.119 --> 17:57.054
coming up with reasons not to blow
the back of your fucking head off!

17:57.055 --> 18:00.895
You're not sounding like that happy
little suburbanite I saw this morning.

18:00.930 --> 18:02.780
Don't forget.

18:02.815 --> 18:04.700
Never can tell who's listening in.

18:04.735 --> 18:07.615
Just watch my shit, Case.
I'll be back in a couple of hours,

18:07.807 --> 18:09.854
I'll pick up
my bags and I'll split.

18:10.079 --> 18:11.420
"Watch your shit"?

18:11.455 --> 18:12.862
You're not
hearing me, Nick. get--

18:13.087 --> 18:15.295
Sorry, case. time's up.
Gotta go.

18:15.330 --> 18:16.542
Nick.

18:16.831 --> 18:18.959
Nick!

18:18.994 --> 18:21.052
Nick!

18:21.087 --> 18:23.935
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

19:03.328 --> 19:05.248
Say, man,
you got the wrong house.

19:05.283 --> 19:07.168
I didn't order any pizza.

19:07.203 --> 19:09.023
What?

19:09.088 --> 19:12.224
I said you got the wrong house!
I didn't order the pizza!

19:12.512 --> 19:15.008
This ain't your pizza, no?

19:15.296 --> 19:16.768
No.

19:17.728 --> 19:20.576
What kind is it?

19:21.537 --> 19:22.688
Meat lover's.

19:22.945 --> 19:24.417
I'll tell you what--
How much is it?

19:24.544 --> 19:25.568
I'll buy if off you.

19:25.825 --> 19:29.217
No, man. No can do, no?
You ain't ordered the pizza,

19:29.252 --> 19:30.560
I can't sell it to you.

19:30.848 --> 19:33.088
What are you going
to do with it, take it back?

19:33.089 --> 19:34.081
I'm offering to buy it from you.

19:34.369 --> 19:35.968
Tell you what...

19:36.161 --> 19:39.809
I'll sell you this one if you
let me use your phone, yeah?

19:39.844 --> 19:42.368
Deal.
Come on in.

19:46.529 --> 19:49.377
You know what happens
if I pull this trigger?

19:49.412 --> 19:52.800
- Do you?
- You repaint my ceiling.

19:53.026 --> 19:55.137
Yeah, man.

19:55.138 --> 19:57.058
You know why I'm here, yeah?

19:58.018 --> 20:00.033
Collecting for D.A.R.E.?

20:00.290 --> 20:05.698
Okay, you give me the shit,
and it's over real quick like.

20:05.733 --> 20:07.426
Yeah.

20:07.618 --> 20:08.769
Yeah. well, I hope you can swim.

20:09.026 --> 20:12.449
- I put it down the disposal.
- You put it in the drain?

20:12.450 --> 20:15.298
Every milligram.

20:16.290 --> 20:17.215
Okay.

20:17.250 --> 20:19.135
Why you forcing me
to pain you now?

20:19.170 --> 20:22.530
Look, motherfucker,
I don't have a clue...

20:22.565 --> 20:25.890
what's going on here,
and I really don't care.

20:26.818 --> 20:28.738
Check it out, professor.

20:41.571 --> 20:43.874
Why would you do such a thing?

20:44.099 --> 20:46.019
I'm not a drug dealer.
I don't want that crap in my house.

20:46.054 --> 20:48.899
This too much for me.

20:51.810 --> 20:53.698
Yes, sir.

20:53.922 --> 20:56.610
No, I'm here, man.

20:56.611 --> 20:58.496
No, he don't have it.

20:58.531 --> 21:00.483
Him put it in the sink, yo.

21:00.739 --> 21:02.754
I checked.
No, man, he straight-up done it.

21:03.011 --> 21:05.218
Him say he don't want it
in his house no more, yeah?

21:05.219 --> 21:07.139
"No, I'm not a drug dealer."

21:08.579 --> 21:11.939
You sure, yeah? But--

21:12.899 --> 21:15.779
Yeah, man.
Yeah, man.

21:15.814 --> 21:17.664
Got it.

21:17.699 --> 21:21.507
Sorry, man.
But you got to go.

21:21.539 --> 21:23.459
Him doubly pissed
now that you trashed it, yeah.

21:27.300 --> 21:29.220
I have a little favor to ask.

21:31.171 --> 21:32.195
Favor?

21:32.420 --> 21:35.939
I think I could use a little ganj.

21:43.620 --> 21:44.580
Yeah, man.

22:10.532 --> 22:13.700
Die.

22:13.989 --> 22:18.212
Hydroponic, man.

22:18.247 --> 22:20.132
Yeah.

22:22.021 --> 22:23.941
Oh, yeah.

22:31.621 --> 22:34.501
Feel that.

22:52.773 --> 22:55.653
You fond of music, man?

22:57.573 --> 22:59.173
What?

22:59.366 --> 23:02.437
You think I do this
'cause I like killing people, huh?

23:03.558 --> 23:05.221
No-no.

23:05.222 --> 23:08.373
Ga-ga music is my life, yeah.

23:08.408 --> 23:11.525
I have aspirations, yeah.

23:11.782 --> 23:13.670
That's what I do on the radio.

23:13.862 --> 23:16.742
I'm this close to a record deal.

23:16.777 --> 23:18.627
Then...

23:18.662 --> 23:20.582
No more of the killing.

23:52.615 --> 23:56.935
It's time, man.
Dog day, yeah?

23:57.063 --> 23:59.943
I'm just helping you on
to the next life, you know.

24:17.223 --> 24:18.695
Yeah, man?

24:18.730 --> 24:20.167
Marcia...

24:20.360 --> 24:22.727
Can I call you back, yo?

24:22.919 --> 24:24.423
I'm kinda into something.

24:24.648 --> 24:26.789
Who?

24:26.824 --> 24:29.319
In the office right now?

24:29.354 --> 24:31.815
You want me to come down?

24:32.136 --> 24:34.503
Over the phone.

24:34.504 --> 24:37.192
No, man, the acoustics
would be lousy.

24:37.960 --> 24:40.295
Yeah, yeah.
You're the boss, yeah.

24:40.296 --> 24:43.976
Hey, grab the blue tape
now, and put it the box.

24:44.968 --> 24:46.983
- Come on!
- You gotta be kidding me.

24:57.609 --> 24:59.464
No. no. no.
Turn it way up. way up.

24:59.593 --> 25:02.344
Can you hear it?
Yeah, man.

25:02.379 --> 25:07.144
# Follow me. #

25:07.176 --> 25:10.984
- # Follow me # - # Every day
mortality stares me in the face-ah #

25:10.985 --> 25:13.865
# Writing in reality's
keepin' me awake now #

25:13.900 --> 25:16.553
# Puttin'on
the new me to work it. #

25:16.745 --> 25:19.241
# It's like letting go of things
no choice but to forget #

25:19.465 --> 25:21.577
# Pack up my nine and
I strap it to my waist, now #

25:21.578 --> 25:24.329
# Smoke on the reefer
to keep my head straight #

25:24.361 --> 25:24.457
# Smoke on the reefer
to keep my head straight #

25:24.458 --> 25:27.338
# Talk to Jah for the lyrics
now they're coming from the crowd #

25:27.373 --> 25:29.577
# A doper M.C.
I know will never be found #

25:29.865 --> 25:33.098
- # Follow me #
- # Don't know what I'm watchin' Don't know what I see #

25:33.133 --> 25:34.985
# See, I know that I'm from
got to follow me #

25:41.033 --> 25:44.585
Sign him quick.
His value's about to go up.

25:45.930 --> 25:48.425
I just love duct tape, don't you?

25:48.426 --> 25:51.306
You're probably one of them morons
who call it "duck" tape.

25:51.370 --> 25:56.105
Here's the situation, ganja boy:

25:56.106 --> 25:57.450
You had no way of knowing...

25:57.674 --> 25:59.946
that I was merely an innocent
bystander to all of this.

26:00.138 --> 26:02.858
And you did share your stash.

26:02.893 --> 26:04.795
I can appreciate this.

26:04.830 --> 26:06.698
Not to mention the fact...

26:06.699 --> 26:09.544
that I really
don't want to kill you.

26:09.579 --> 26:13.386
I don't even know what I'd
do with you once you were dead.

26:13.421 --> 26:16.009
But I can't just let you go.

26:17.130 --> 26:18.985
So,

26:20.106 --> 26:22.026
I have a dilemma.

26:28.746 --> 26:30.057
What time is it?

26:31.499 --> 26:32.586
Fuck.

26:45.099 --> 26:47.818
Just a minute.

27:20.779 --> 27:22.539
Hello.

27:22.540 --> 27:23.465
Mr. Wells.

27:23.500 --> 27:25.420
Dr.Jarvis, so good
to see you again.

27:25.455 --> 27:26.859
Nice to see you, too.

27:27.084 --> 27:28.300
Won't you come in?

27:29.228 --> 27:30.188
Sorry about that.

27:30.348 --> 27:33.067
I-I couldn't find
the key to the door.

27:33.164 --> 27:35.948
- I didn't hear it unlock.
- Oh, that's right.

27:36.044 --> 27:39.820
I didn't find it.
Um, right this way.

27:40.077 --> 27:42.668
So, Mr. Wells, you and your wife...

27:42.703 --> 27:44.940
would like to adopt the baby.

27:45.196 --> 27:46.764
- Yes, sir. that's right.
- Okay.

27:47.053 --> 27:51.308
Now, you understand the next step
in the adoption proceedings?

27:51.373 --> 27:54.221
Um, yes. We are to be
individually evaluated.

27:54.256 --> 27:56.716
Yes. that's right.
That's why I'm here.

27:56.941 --> 27:58.026
Uh, your wife, of course,

27:58.061 --> 28:00.684
has already completed
her evaluation.

28:00.845 --> 28:02.860
She's an extraordinary woman.

28:02.861 --> 28:04.746
Absolutely extraordinary woman.

28:04.781 --> 28:08.588
- Um, shall we begin?
- Sure. yeah. One thing--

28:08.589 --> 28:11.469
Weren't we already evaluated
at the previous screening?

28:11.504 --> 28:13.950
No. that was just
the initial consultation.

28:13.985 --> 28:16.397
This is the individual
competency test.

28:16.653 --> 28:19.148
Do you have a problem
with that, Mr. Wells?

28:19.149 --> 28:21.997
No... not really.

28:22.029 --> 28:24.301
Good. Then we can get started.

28:24.590 --> 28:25.869
And what are your
qualifications, Dr.Jarvis?

28:25.904 --> 28:28.749
Are you an M.D., uh--

28:29.902 --> 28:33.549
Are you nervous, Mr. Wells?

28:33.613 --> 28:35.597
No.

28:36.622 --> 28:38.381
Why?

28:38.542 --> 28:40.909
Because what you're doing
is this thing...

28:41.102 --> 28:43.147
called conversational
transference.

28:43.182 --> 28:45.034
Simply means
that you're trying to evade...

28:45.069 --> 28:47.949
answering my question
by answering me with questions.

28:47.950 --> 28:51.310
It's something that's
usually indulged in...

28:51.345 --> 28:54.670
by individuals
who are trying to hide something.

28:56.590 --> 28:58.766
You trying to hide
something from me, Mr. Wells?

29:01.390 --> 29:03.310
- No.
- Good.

29:05.230 --> 29:07.694
- Do you currently use drugs?
- No.

29:07.918 --> 29:09.102
Not even Tylenol?

29:09.359 --> 29:11.982
Some... sure.

29:11.983 --> 29:15.534
- Any history of drug use?
- Uh...

29:15.790 --> 29:17.486
A little, I guess.

29:17.679 --> 29:19.886
About as much as anyone
who goes to college.

29:20.142 --> 29:24.429
"Justification of drug use."

29:24.430 --> 29:25.774
How about alcohol?

29:27.310 --> 29:29.195
An occasional beer.

29:29.230 --> 29:33.070
You ever been incarcerated
or institutionalized?

29:33.071 --> 29:35.599
- No.
- Any history of mental illness?

29:35.855 --> 29:38.830
- No.
- You know, there's something about your application...

29:38.831 --> 29:41.676
that's very troubling to me.

29:41.711 --> 29:43.983
There's a gap of two,
two and a half years.

29:44.271 --> 29:46.158
I mean--

29:47.504 --> 29:52.304
- It occurs, like, five years ago.
- Yeah.

29:52.339 --> 29:55.149
Can I get you,
uh, some iced tea?

29:55.184 --> 29:57.807
- No. No, thank you.
- I'm a little dry.

29:57.999 --> 30:00.943
- Do you mind?
- Oh, no. please, go. Go right ahead.

30:02.831 --> 30:05.711
I asked because
your wife was very vague...

30:05.746 --> 30:07.648
about what you might
have been doing...

30:07.683 --> 30:09.551
and I was hoping
you might be able...

30:09.648 --> 30:12.431
to shed a little bit
of light on it for me.

30:15.312 --> 30:19.120
Uh, I was in L.A.

30:19.152 --> 30:20.077
Yes. that's just
what your wife said.

30:20.112 --> 30:22.512
Could you be a little bit
more specific, though?

30:22.800 --> 30:27.824
Oh, well...
I-I was doing some odd jobs...

30:27.859 --> 30:30.319
and this and that, you know?

30:30.544 --> 30:33.584
No, I don't know.

30:33.585 --> 30:35.470
Could you elaborate?

30:35.505 --> 30:39.184
Well, I did work
as a mechanic for a while.

30:39.345 --> 30:40.656
Oh, you mean like
for a body shop?

30:40.944 --> 30:44.111
No. I mean like
in a performance shop.

30:44.112 --> 30:48.240
- Perf--
- Well, exotics and, uh, rally cars.

30:48.464 --> 30:49.871
Oh. Uh-huh.

30:49.872 --> 30:51.757
You know, I've changed my mind.

30:51.792 --> 30:53.712
I think I would
like some iced tea.

30:54.737 --> 30:57.552
I'm sorry.
We're all out of iced tea.

30:57.587 --> 31:01.264
How about a beer?
Yeah--

31:06.225 --> 31:09.105
- You don't have anything else?
- No.

31:09.140 --> 31:10.990
No. I don't.

31:11.025 --> 31:14.865
This is-- This is just about
all that-- all that I have.

31:14.900 --> 31:17.745
Chris has been a little busy.

31:25.105 --> 31:27.313
I'm-I'm sorry, Dr.Jarvis.

31:27.314 --> 31:28.785
What-What were you saying?

31:29.010 --> 31:33.074
Oh, I was just asking if you remember
the name of that performance shop.

31:33.109 --> 31:34.994
Uh, Bubba's.

31:36.498 --> 31:37.874
"Bubba's"?

31:38.834 --> 31:44.625
Bubba's...
Big... Block... Shop.

31:44.626 --> 31:47.474
Do you have
a number for Bubba's?

31:50.355 --> 31:55.186
No. No, they're,
uh, out of business.

31:59.922 --> 32:01.874
Could you excuse me...

32:01.875 --> 32:02.800
for just a second?

32:02.835 --> 32:06.675
My cat... must have got in--

32:06.710 --> 32:08.560
got into the garage...

32:08.595 --> 32:11.475
and I'll be... be right back.

32:28.756 --> 32:30.672
See these?

32:30.707 --> 32:33.522
Got any idea what
I can do with these?

32:35.476 --> 32:39.475
- Mm-hmm.
- Somehow, I just don't believe you.

32:40.659 --> 32:45.075
Besides, that'd just
make a lot of noise.

33:11.028 --> 33:12.948
Sorry about that, Dr.Jarvis.

33:24.437 --> 33:28.277
- So, where were we?
- I was asking you about L.A.

33:28.469 --> 33:32.117
Oh, yeah.

33:34.037 --> 33:35.957
Wow, I apologize.

33:35.992 --> 33:37.877
This never happens.

33:44.629 --> 33:46.069
Can I help you?

33:46.261 --> 33:48.468
"May I."

33:48.469 --> 33:52.277
All right...
may I help you?

33:53.237 --> 33:56.308
- So, you're Casey?
- That's right.

33:56.501 --> 33:58.612
I'm a friend of Nick's.

34:00.149 --> 34:02.837
I'll bet you are.

34:02.838 --> 34:03.798
May I come in?

34:04.758 --> 34:07.603
- Nick's not here right now.
- I'll wait.

34:07.638 --> 34:11.478
- I'm a little busy.
- Well, I'll be real quiet.

34:11.513 --> 34:15.283
Look, lady, I just told you.
I'm a little busy!

34:15.318 --> 34:18.228
It's quite all right. I would
enjoy speaking with your friend.

34:18.230 --> 34:22.038
She's not my friend.
I don't know who the fuck she is.

34:22.070 --> 34:24.981
Uh, hi.
I am Dallas.

34:25.237 --> 34:27.830
No. don't bother introducing
yourself 'cause she's not staying.

34:27.864 --> 34:30.422
What is that?

34:30.458 --> 34:32.981
That is my phone.

34:34.070 --> 34:35.989
Aren't you going to answer it?

34:36.246 --> 34:38.358
Yeah. I'm going to answer it.

34:38.393 --> 34:41.333
Where's your cordless?

34:41.558 --> 34:43.414
You doing a survey?

34:43.702 --> 34:46.998
I had one.
I broke it.

34:46.998 --> 34:49.879
- In anger?
- Yeah.

34:50.071 --> 34:51.799
I mean, no.

34:51.991 --> 34:55.254
Can you give me, uh,
just a second?

34:55.543 --> 34:59.478
Don't sit down.

35:05.271 --> 35:08.116
- Hello. Nick.
- Case.

35:08.151 --> 35:09.654
You get the fuck
back here right now.

35:09.943 --> 35:11.767
No. I got myself
in a little trouble, Case.

35:11.927 --> 35:14.839
You, my friend, are in a lot more
trouble than you fuckin' know.

35:14.874 --> 35:19.604
- Yalie, huh? I'm a Vassar gal myself.
- Oh, really?

35:19.639 --> 35:24.439
- What was your major?
- Poly-scI and philosophy. You mind?

35:37.911 --> 35:39.991
Casey's got to be
real fucked up...

35:40.248 --> 35:42.039
if you're making
a house call.

35:42.232 --> 35:44.631
I'm beginning
to think so, yes.

35:44.632 --> 35:47.496
Some Jamaican showed up here,
and he tried to kill me.

35:47.531 --> 35:50.360
And now one of your bimbos
is sitting in my living room!

35:50.395 --> 35:53.240
- Bimbo?
- Some bitch named Dallas.

35:53.432 --> 35:56.085
Tell me, you're not
one of those, uh...

35:56.120 --> 35:58.743
Freudian sub-intellectuals
who waste all their time...

35:58.968 --> 36:00.728
fixating on penis envy?

36:00.888 --> 36:02.805
Well, sex is a prime motivator.

36:02.840 --> 36:06.645
I mean, indirectly,
I believe sex...

36:06.680 --> 36:10.103
is behind most of our major
thought processes.

36:10.329 --> 36:13.397
- You think so?
- Absolutely.

36:13.432 --> 36:17.272
- Do you like pornos?
- Excuse me?

36:17.307 --> 36:20.073
You know, pornos.
Fuck films.

36:20.108 --> 36:22.840
Surely you've heard stories.

36:22.968 --> 36:23.957
Yes. I've heard stories,

36:23.992 --> 36:28.440
but I've never-- never really
given them that much thought.

36:28.665 --> 36:30.680
I love them,
especially fag flicks.

36:30.809 --> 36:35.225
Their big cocks sliding in
and out of each other.

36:35.481 --> 36:39.321
Fuck, that gets me so wet they have
to steam clean the seat after I leave.

36:41.241 --> 36:43.161
In fact,

36:47.001 --> 36:50.328
I'm getting wet
just talking about it.

36:51.833 --> 36:54.137
- What aren't you telling me, Nick?
- Nothing, Case.

36:54.361 --> 36:58.489
-Just don't give her my shit.
- Don't worry. I don't have it.

36:58.553 --> 37:00.953
- You give it to the Jamaican?
- No.

37:00.988 --> 37:03.318
- I flushed it down the sink.
- What?

37:03.353 --> 37:06.201
I went on as a day player
on this porn film in L.A.

37:06.202 --> 37:09.082
Just to see
what it was like, right?

37:09.178 --> 37:12.922
So, I spent five hours with this guy
ramming his dick up my ass...

37:12.957 --> 37:15.802
and these two women
licking my clit.

37:15.898 --> 37:18.682
Not what you'd expect,
though. It's just acting.

37:18.717 --> 37:21.337
I mean, at first, it was great.

37:21.530 --> 37:26.041
Then you have some prick director that
comes over and yells "cut" in your face...

37:26.266 --> 37:29.273
and some queen makeup artist that
comes over every couple of minutes...

37:29.274 --> 37:31.194
to touch up the makeup that's
been slobbered off your tits.

37:31.229 --> 37:35.034
So you don't really
have a chance to enjoy it.

37:35.069 --> 37:37.626
Finally, I just walked off the set.

37:38.874 --> 37:40.794
Cool experience, though.

37:43.387 --> 37:45.563
You got a hard-on,Jarv?

37:45.598 --> 37:48.460
All right--

37:48.495 --> 37:51.288
Time to go.

37:51.323 --> 37:53.530
Your cow is calling you.

37:53.755 --> 37:56.826
- I am so sorry, Dr.Jarvis.
- Oh, no. Please, take your time.

37:59.003 --> 38:01.883
You get the fuck out of my house.

38:03.995 --> 38:08.634
Did you say you were from L.A.?

38:08.635 --> 38:10.520
- What?
- What?

38:10.555 --> 38:13.147
Is that how you answer
the phone these days?

38:13.403 --> 38:15.354
I'm sorry, honey.
I thought you were somebody else.

38:15.355 --> 38:19.483
- Did you know Mr. Wells when he was living in L.A.?
- Well, not directly.

38:19.676 --> 38:22.043
Course,
I heard of his work.

38:22.044 --> 38:23.932
His work?

38:26.844 --> 38:29.819
Isn't that why you're here?

38:30.044 --> 38:32.603
What do you need?
I mean, how's your day going?

38:32.604 --> 38:35.484
Tough. We're at
an impasse on the fee, so...

38:35.519 --> 38:36.827
That's great, honey.

38:37.084 --> 38:38.875
What?
Casey, are you okay?

38:38.910 --> 38:40.667
How's everything there?

38:40.924 --> 38:44.124
Oh, it's interesting.
You really wouldn't believe it.

38:44.316 --> 38:46.620
Have you seen Dr.Jarvis?

38:46.908 --> 38:49.915
- Yes, and he's here right now.
- Really?

38:49.916 --> 38:51.801
- How's it going?
- Huh--

38:51.836 --> 38:57.116
And then, once I met Nick, I got
the full-blown Casey Wells story.

38:57.404 --> 39:00.444
- You want one?
- One what?

39:00.479 --> 39:03.067
A Casey Wells story.

39:04.284 --> 39:08.219
- Yes, I would.
- How about the last one?

39:08.445 --> 39:11.004
- Fine.
- All right.

39:11.005 --> 39:13.850
Nick and Casey...

39:13.885 --> 39:17.725
Had this guy, Jimmy.
A small-time nothing,

39:17.885 --> 39:20.604
a bird dog for some
of the mid-level players.

39:20.605 --> 39:24.476
It's cool, man.
You just took too big a lick.

39:24.477 --> 39:27.277
That is some rank
fuckin' shit, man.

39:27.312 --> 39:30.077
And he set up
a meeting between them...

39:30.237 --> 39:33.117
and this big nigger
named... uh, Lester James.

39:33.152 --> 39:35.962
Of course, most people
knew him as "Ballpeen. "

39:35.997 --> 39:39.805
- Ballpeen's casa at 7:00.
- Where in the fuck a nigger get a name like that?

39:39.934 --> 39:42.781
- You seen little nigger's arm, right?
- Oh, yeah.

39:43.006 --> 39:45.565
- That's why they call him
Ballpeen. - He broke Jimmy's arm--

39:45.600 --> 39:48.410
with a ten-pound
ball peen hammer.

39:48.445 --> 39:51.325
Three years ago
LesterJames, a.k.a. Ballpeen,

39:51.326 --> 39:53.211
was a big, stud motherfucker.

39:53.246 --> 39:55.166
Had a stable of bitches
he fucked on a regular basis,

39:55.326 --> 39:58.589
but every couple weeks...
he went out to get some strange.

39:58.814 --> 40:01.758
One night, Lester finds
himself in this titty bar,

40:01.917 --> 40:05.757
and this knockout white girl named Raven
is just gyrating her little tits off.

40:05.758 --> 40:08.603
Well, Lester wanted her
in the worst way.

40:08.638 --> 40:10.494
Even more when she told him
to go fuck himself.

40:10.654 --> 40:12.861
He sprinkles
a little fairy dust on her...

40:13.086 --> 40:15.678
somehow gets
her to go back to his place.

40:15.713 --> 40:18.270
That was all she wrote.
He abused this bitch.

40:18.526 --> 40:22.045
He fucked her every way
you can think of and then some.

40:22.046 --> 40:23.966
Finally, he gets ready
to go again, and he figures...

40:24.001 --> 40:25.886
he'd really degrade this bitch
and make her blow him.

40:25.921 --> 40:28.766
So, he pushes
her head down and, bam!

40:30.686 --> 40:34.909
She bites that
motherfucker's dick... clean off.

40:35.166 --> 40:37.406
Fortunately, they found it
and sewed it back on.

40:37.407 --> 40:40.639
But it never worked right again.

40:40.830 --> 40:44.157
The problem is, a story like that
gets around, you know how it is.

40:44.158 --> 40:46.366
So to combat this, anytime he even
heard anybody talk about it,

40:46.559 --> 40:49.918
he'd use this
fuckin' hammer on them.

40:49.919 --> 40:51.804
"Ballpeen" kind of stuck.

40:51.839 --> 40:56.159
- And Jimmy?
- Over the years, this kind of shit gets out of control.

40:56.415 --> 40:58.078
So one day, Ballpeen
is late for a meeting,

40:58.335 --> 41:01.406
and Jimmy made the mistake
of asking if he'd been jerking off.

41:01.407 --> 41:03.839
Next thing you know,
Jimmy's got a broken arm.

41:05.439 --> 41:08.511
Goddamn.

41:08.767 --> 41:11.327
Fast-forward to Ballpeen's.
Just another drug deal...

41:11.551 --> 41:13.887
- in La-La Land.
- Motherfuckers team make it out here?

41:13.922 --> 41:15.807
Want to get this over with.

41:15.842 --> 41:18.463
Shit makes me nervous.

41:31.200 --> 41:34.687
What the fuck
is up with this shit?

41:34.912 --> 41:36.896
You must have
some pretty bad fuckin' karma...

41:36.928 --> 41:38.848
feel the need
for that kind of artillery.

41:38.883 --> 41:41.728
Don't worry, babe.
It's cool.

41:47.488 --> 41:50.333
Casey. Whoa, whoa.
Hey, man!

41:50.368 --> 41:52.352
Fuck you! You in my
motherfuckin' house!

41:52.640 --> 41:55.133
Now, come on,
big black man.

41:55.168 --> 41:58.080
You know I wouldn't bring no niggas
up in here unless they was cool.

41:58.081 --> 42:01.344
Let that bad motherfucker in.

42:10.561 --> 42:13.408
- How's that arm, nigga?
- It's all right.

42:13.409 --> 42:18.174
- It's still here.
- You a bad motherfucker?

42:18.209 --> 42:22.369
I just don't let people run their hands
all over me. It shows a lack of trust.

42:22.561 --> 42:25.761
- May I sit down?
- Are you here to sit?

42:32.290 --> 42:34.529
You tell me.

42:47.042 --> 42:48.962
Sit down.

43:09.090 --> 43:11.362
- Shit looks good.
- Your turn.

43:11.554 --> 43:13.855
Why don't you show us
the money now?

43:13.890 --> 43:17.730
Why don't you, uh. let me
choose the next kilo to test?

43:20.643 --> 43:22.498
Help yourself.

43:42.691 --> 43:44.611
Derrick.

43:47.491 --> 43:50.371
Count 'em,Jimmy.

43:53.475 --> 43:55.874
Some more, square?

44:00.004 --> 44:03.844
Since we're all good friends here,
I got a question for you.

44:03.879 --> 44:06.563
Ask away.

44:06.691 --> 44:07.651
It's all here, Case.

44:09.571 --> 44:12.643
I heard about
this big, bad motherfucker.

44:12.932 --> 44:16.484
He's got this habit
of hitting niggers with his hammer.

44:19.172 --> 44:22.020
I've heard the reason
why he uses it...

44:22.052 --> 44:23.937
and I can sympathize.

44:23.972 --> 44:27.777
But, uh...
there's this one thing...

44:27.812 --> 44:29.924
that I just-- I can't
get it out of my head.

44:30.180 --> 44:32.644
- Go on.
- Well...

44:32.645 --> 44:36.485
I heard about how most niggers got
these really big dicks, you know.

44:36.520 --> 44:38.820
I mean...
just salami-sized cocks.

44:39.013 --> 44:41.250
Well...

44:41.285 --> 44:43.205
Now, I've had many
a different blow job...

44:43.240 --> 44:44.325
by any number
of different bitches.

44:44.613 --> 44:47.653
So, I know how much room
even my white-boy dick...

44:47.876 --> 44:49.891
takes up
in a bitch's mouth, right.

44:49.892 --> 44:52.737
My question...

44:52.772 --> 44:54.820
is how the hell
this little bitch...

44:55.013 --> 44:58.532
got this big,
nigger dick in her mouth...

44:58.565 --> 45:01.412
chomped it off
all in one bite?

45:01.413 --> 45:04.101
She could have gnawed
on it for a while,

45:04.293 --> 45:08.149
but I don't think there's a
motherfucker in here let that happen.

45:08.184 --> 45:12.005
- Yo, we got a problem here.
- So, the only thing I can think of...

45:12.040 --> 45:13.925
is that this big, bad
ass-kickin' nigger...

45:13.960 --> 45:15.810
had this little, itty-bitty dick...

45:15.845 --> 45:18.660
wouldn't have
done him no good, anyway.

45:18.757 --> 45:21.605
What do you think?

45:21.606 --> 45:23.493
Am I close?

45:23.622 --> 45:27.430
I said, we got
a motherfuckin'problem here!

45:45.478 --> 45:48.451
What you doing, man?
I'm fuckin' dead.

45:48.486 --> 45:50.373
- Fuckin'dead.
- Why didn't you use a silencer, Casey?

45:52.326 --> 45:53.317
Get the fuckin'money, Jimmy.

45:53.574 --> 45:56.277
I'm fuckin'dead.
I'm fuckin'dead, man.

45:56.312 --> 45:58.981
Why didn't you use
a silencer, Casey?

45:59.046 --> 46:01.893
You want to go door-to-door--
tell everybody my fuckin' name?

46:01.894 --> 46:04.739
- Oh! I'm fuckin', fuckin' dead.
- Fuckin' forgot 'em.

46:04.774 --> 46:09.030
Good luck, man. I don't know what
the fuck is wrong with you.

46:09.286 --> 46:11.014
We got 45 seconds.
Let's go.

46:18.982 --> 46:20.582
You still here?

46:22.503 --> 46:25.190
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving.

46:25.383 --> 46:27.718
I've heard quite
enough for one day.

46:27.847 --> 46:29.732
What-- What?
What did you tell him?

46:29.767 --> 46:33.607
- I don't even know this bitch.
- Well, she certainly seems to know you.

46:33.642 --> 46:36.487
Thank you very much.
It's been a pleasure to meet you.

46:36.522 --> 46:38.407
Could have made
a very bad mistake.

46:38.442 --> 46:41.062
Dr.Jarvis.
Now, I-- I--

46:41.255 --> 46:43.140
- Doctor!
- We'll be in touch, Mr. Wells.

46:43.175 --> 46:47.015
No, now, there's been some kind
of a mistake, Dr.Jarvis.

46:47.050 --> 46:48.935
Dr.Jarvis!

46:52.775 --> 46:57.575
- I'm fucked.
- Yes... you are.

47:12.008 --> 47:15.304
Well, Case, it's just you and I.

47:15.496 --> 47:17.543
What do you think?

47:17.737 --> 47:21.097
My wife's going to have my ass
when she finds out I let...

47:21.132 --> 47:24.457
some dyke in a pink rubber dress
blow off her chances...

47:24.492 --> 47:26.377
for Happy Meals
and diaper wipes.

47:26.412 --> 47:29.222
It's red, asshole.

47:29.257 --> 47:34.057
- Where is it?
- I'll tell you, if you answer one question.

47:34.092 --> 47:36.902
Sure. Shoot.

47:36.937 --> 47:39.782
Are you on the rag?

47:39.817 --> 47:43.688
Because you look like
one of those women who are...

47:43.689 --> 47:46.534
explosive under stressful
situations, and--

47:46.569 --> 47:51.304
Being married, you should fucking
know how much women hate that question.

47:52.361 --> 47:54.214
But being a typical male,

47:54.249 --> 47:56.137
you ignore
your better judgment...

47:56.172 --> 47:59.017
and ask anyway, huh?

47:59.018 --> 48:02.409
I should just do your wife
a favor and blow your head off.

48:02.602 --> 48:05.738
It's as if every mood swing
can be written off as...

48:05.773 --> 48:07.623
She's just on the rag.

48:07.658 --> 48:09.543
Like that explains something.

48:09.578 --> 48:13.898
Women have mood shifts,
that is a fact of life.

48:13.933 --> 48:18.218
And for your information,
I am a complete bitch,

48:18.253 --> 48:20.138
whether I'm on the rag or not.

48:20.173 --> 48:22.441
Hmm?

48:22.698 --> 48:25.705
Now, let me answer
your question.

48:33.610 --> 48:38.378
- Does that answer it?
- I'd say you're right. You're just a bitch.

48:38.413 --> 48:40.585
Good.
Now...

48:42.219 --> 48:44.104
answer my questions...

48:44.139 --> 48:47.082
before you start
losing appendages.

48:47.338 --> 48:49.898
It's gone.

48:49.899 --> 48:51.784
- Gone?
- Yeah.

48:51.819 --> 48:56.042
- What do you mean, it's gone?
- I 86'ed it.

48:56.299 --> 48:59.496
I sent it
swimming down the sink.

48:59.531 --> 49:02.379
- Bye-bye. - You're one
smooth motherfucker, Casey.

49:04.331 --> 49:07.176
You can keep the smack,
and I'll take the money,

49:07.211 --> 49:12.011
- And we can call it even.
- Money? What fucking money?

49:12.042 --> 49:14.858
It seems we're going around
in circles here. Hmm.

49:15.819 --> 49:18.986
I want the two mil, Casey.

49:19.211 --> 49:23.498
- Let me--
- Let me explain something to you.

49:23.499 --> 49:26.762
I am not a drug dealer.
It's been four years...

49:27.019 --> 49:29.259
since I've even seen any drugs.

49:29.260 --> 49:31.145
I'm an architect.

49:31.180 --> 49:35.945
I am a happy little Republican...

49:35.980 --> 49:37.865
who spends
the majority of his time...

49:37.900 --> 49:39.820
trying to figure out
how to pay the fucking bills...

49:40.043 --> 49:42.731
and make his wife happy.

49:43.692 --> 49:46.572
I got to tell you, Casey,
I'm not impressed.

49:46.607 --> 49:48.457
After everything
I heard about you...

49:48.492 --> 49:51.340
I thought you were
gonna be more like... me.

49:51.375 --> 49:55.180
But you are a sheep
like all the rest.

49:55.215 --> 49:57.065
There will come a time...

49:57.100 --> 50:01.996
when even you
can't handle it anymore.

50:02.220 --> 50:04.780
You'll pack it up
or you'll put a bullet...

50:04.815 --> 50:07.212
in that pretty
little head of yours.

50:07.436 --> 50:10.540
Or someone else will.

50:10.541 --> 50:12.426
You are a pussy, Casey.

50:12.461 --> 50:16.028
Nick wouldn't admit
it, but it's true.

50:16.063 --> 50:19.595
You just couldn't
handle it, could you?

50:19.820 --> 50:23.052
Nick ever tell you
about that last time?

50:23.087 --> 50:25.003
Sure. Ballpeen's apartment?

50:25.260 --> 50:28.812
- Uh-huh.
- Did he tell you about the girl?

50:30.701 --> 50:33.964
- What's up?
- Why didn't you use the silencer, Casey?

50:34.252 --> 50:37.420
Get the fucking money.

50:37.421 --> 50:39.341
- Why didn't you use a silencer?
- You wanna go door to door...

50:39.376 --> 50:42.221
and tell everybody
in the building my fuckin'name?

50:42.285 --> 50:46.061
- I forgot 'em, all right?
- I don't know what the fuck is wrong with you.

50:46.253 --> 50:50.093
Get the fuckin' money,Jimmy,
and let's get the fuck out.

50:50.285 --> 50:52.781
We got 45 seconds.
Let's go.

51:15.822 --> 51:19.662
- What?
-Jesus.

51:19.854 --> 51:22.542
She's seven,
maybe eight months, pregnant, Nick.

51:22.577 --> 51:24.653
Fuck me.

51:24.846 --> 51:27.342
Come on, Casey, we got to go.

51:27.377 --> 51:28.493
She's dead, Casey.

51:28.686 --> 51:31.182
Dead, just like we're going to be...

51:31.217 --> 51:33.133
if we don't move our asses.

51:33.134 --> 51:35.662
We got to go.
Snap out of it, man!

51:40.814 --> 51:44.654
It's clear. We got to jump. That bitch
was gonna kill you, man. Let it go.

51:47.503 --> 51:50.383
- What about Jimmy? Is he--
- He's meat loaf, bro.

51:53.263 --> 51:55.183
This is it, Nick.

51:55.218 --> 51:57.103
No more.

52:05.743 --> 52:07.663
That was it.

52:11.503 --> 52:14.383
Oh, that was a real
touching story, Case.

52:17.295 --> 52:20.366
Remind me to submit it to
Reader's Digest after you're gone.

52:22.480 --> 52:24.943
So it looks like we're
going to have to wait for Nick.

52:24.944 --> 52:27.888
What should we do
to kill some time?

52:28.144 --> 52:29.743
I know.

52:31.664 --> 52:35.469
- Let's fuck.
- That's happening.

52:35.504 --> 52:39.344
Even if you weren't the most
disgusting bitch I'd ever met,

52:39.379 --> 52:43.149
I'd have to decline.
You see, I'm a married man.

52:43.184 --> 52:46.064
You seem to be under the impression
that you have a choice here.

53:00.496 --> 53:02.416
Ah, let's see.

53:13.905 --> 53:16.016
You'll appreciate the irony here.

53:19.665 --> 53:22.160
# When a boy loves a girl. #

53:22.449 --> 53:24.433
# He can't be alone. #

53:24.465 --> 53:26.385
# She fills him with joy. #

53:26.420 --> 53:29.265
She wanted to watch.

53:30.257 --> 53:32.272
# And the sound of her voice. #

53:32.465 --> 53:36.016
# Is beautiful music. #

53:36.017 --> 53:41.713
- # A symphony plays when his angel is near. #
- Fuck you, bitch.

53:41.745 --> 53:44.590
# I don't know why. #

53:44.625 --> 53:49.425
- # I can't help myself. #
- There's no fucking way you'll ever get me inside you.

53:53.266 --> 53:55.186
You want to bet?

53:58.034 --> 53:59.985
# Slip me some tongue. #

54:00.146 --> 54:02.865
# An emergency came. #

54:02.866 --> 54:07.601
# Come on and get some
honey make me aware. #

54:09.266 --> 54:11.842
# You're making me crazy. #

54:11.877 --> 54:14.587
# In the very best way. #

54:14.622 --> 54:17.298
# You're making me dream. #

54:17.333 --> 54:19.410
Well, look at that.

54:19.634 --> 54:21.618
Have you done this before?

54:21.874 --> 54:27.825
# I don't know why
I can't help myself. #

54:58.547 --> 55:06.547
# I don't know why
I can't help myself. #

55:25.940 --> 55:27.860
Don't worry.

55:28.148 --> 55:31.091
I'm not going to kill
you till you come.

55:31.126 --> 55:34.035
I'll let you betray
your wife thoroughly.

55:36.020 --> 55:42.900
Maybe if we get lucky,
I'll get pregnant.

56:06.740 --> 56:08.660
Oh--

56:13.269 --> 56:16.277
That was one.

56:16.309 --> 56:19.189
Don't worry.
I'm multiorgasmic.

56:22.069 --> 56:24.914
Got it, honey?
Yeah, hold on.

56:24.949 --> 56:26.834
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Okay, it's flashing.

56:26.869 --> 56:30.709
Okay, here we go. Here we go!
Whoo! Okay, here we go! Whoo!

56:30.744 --> 56:33.589
I love you.

56:35.509 --> 56:37.972
I love you, too.

56:49.941 --> 56:51.861
Number two.

56:54.710 --> 56:59.062
Great self-control.

57:24.503 --> 57:29.268
Goddamn, did you see the way
that bitch head explode? Shit!

57:29.303 --> 57:33.110
Ordinarily, it would be a damn shame
to shoot a piece of ass like that.

57:33.111 --> 57:36.951
you know what I mean? but in
her case, I'll make an exception.

57:36.986 --> 57:40.535
I always hated that bitch.
My name's Billy Hill.

57:40.759 --> 57:42.710
My friend's call me "Hillbilly."
You can call me Mr. Hill.

57:42.711 --> 57:44.631
I hope I didn't interrupt
anything too romantic for you,

57:44.666 --> 57:46.615
but that whore
could go all day long.

57:46.903 --> 57:50.359
Besides, I was getting tired
sitting down in the cab of my truck.

57:50.391 --> 57:51.316
She lost me on the freeway.

57:51.351 --> 57:54.196
Let me give you
a little piece of friendly advice.

57:54.231 --> 57:57.143
I know you're retired. You got
this family thing going here.

57:57.144 --> 58:00.695
But you really ought to have
your name and number unlisted.

58:00.951 --> 58:02.871
Information girl
give me your address.

58:02.904 --> 58:05.495
Your fucking address, man.
That don't sound too smart.

58:05.720 --> 58:07.640
- What are you looking for?
- Tequila.

58:08.664 --> 58:12.471
- To your right.
- Mm.

58:13.431 --> 58:15.351
The good stuff.

58:17.240 --> 58:19.191
Fancy.

58:19.192 --> 58:22.263
You got any limes?
No? Just as well.

58:27.224 --> 58:29.752
Oh!
Yeah! Damn!

58:29.944 --> 58:31.768
It always tastes like
old feet to me.

58:31.803 --> 58:33.592
That shit'll fuck you up,
though. Mm.

58:34.552 --> 58:37.304
You ever hear how it's made?

58:41.305 --> 58:44.120
A bunch of Mexicans sitting
around this big wooden vat...

58:44.377 --> 58:47.000
chewing on agave, right?

58:47.065 --> 58:51.736
They do this days and days
spitting into this giant vat.

58:51.832 --> 58:53.717
Then when it's full,

58:53.752 --> 58:55.672
then they leave that there
to ferment.

58:55.707 --> 58:57.592
When it's ready,

58:57.688 --> 59:00.040
they scoop off the top layer.

59:00.075 --> 59:02.392
That's mescal.
Nasty, huh?

59:02.393 --> 59:04.793
No wonder that shit
tastes so bad.

59:04.828 --> 59:07.193
Well, I ain't going
to shit you, pal.

59:07.228 --> 59:09.078
When I leave here today,

59:09.113 --> 59:11.993
you're going to be dead
as Cinderella over there.

59:12.028 --> 59:16.024
Regardless of what you tell me,

59:16.249 --> 59:18.712
I'm gonna fuck you up.

59:23.546 --> 59:24.441
Ready to get started?

59:28.313 --> 59:30.198
I know you threw out the smack.

59:30.233 --> 59:34.073
And you probably don't know
where the money is, neither.

59:34.108 --> 59:37.450
That's cool.

59:37.485 --> 59:40.758
The truth is...

59:40.793 --> 59:43.638
I ain't got nothing
better to do...

59:43.673 --> 59:45.593
while I wait here
for my old friend, Nick.

59:45.594 --> 59:49.434
Just so you know, I ain't
going to let you bleed to death.

59:49.498 --> 59:54.233
No, sir.
'Cause when I cut you,

59:54.266 --> 59:56.569
I'm going to cauterize you.

59:57.818 --> 01:00:00.826
I consider myself an artist.
Matter of fact,

01:00:00.986 --> 01:00:03.866
I picked up this little girl
at this club one time,

01:00:03.867 --> 01:00:06.679
and I cut on her for 1 6 hours.

01:00:06.714 --> 01:00:11.514
That's a personal best.
But I keep hopin'.

01:00:13.434 --> 01:00:15.319
You know, in a way,

01:00:15.354 --> 01:00:17.562
it's really Nick that's
to blame for all this.

01:00:17.597 --> 01:00:19.770
If he hadn't tried
to double-cross me and Dallas,

01:00:20.091 --> 01:00:22.039
I wouldn't be here.

01:00:22.074 --> 01:00:24.919
All right. Now, let's see.

01:00:24.954 --> 01:00:29.722
I think I'm going to start
at the feet and work my way up!

01:00:36.987 --> 01:00:39.387
What the hell?

01:00:48.955 --> 01:00:51.835
Open the door. police!
Open the fucking door, Will!

01:00:51.870 --> 01:00:55.640
There's no Will here! Go away!

01:00:55.675 --> 01:00:58.555
Stupid son of a bitches.
They got the wrong house.

01:00:58.590 --> 01:01:00.475
Go away!

01:01:00.668 --> 01:01:03.355
Everybody on the ground!

01:01:03.390 --> 01:01:06.235
Don't go nowhere.

01:01:09.628 --> 01:01:12.188
Where's the money, motherfucker?

01:01:18.748 --> 01:01:21.595
Where's the money?

01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:27.355
I mean, there's no money in here!

01:01:28.316 --> 01:01:30.236
Shut up, bitch!

01:01:36.956 --> 01:01:39.801
There's a .45 in the fridge...

01:01:39.836 --> 01:01:42.716
and you grab
a fucking frying pan.

01:01:42.751 --> 01:01:45.596
I'm must have
some really bad karma.

01:01:50.429 --> 01:01:51.354
Stupid cops.

01:01:51.389 --> 01:01:53.309
They busted up the wrong house.

01:01:53.344 --> 01:01:55.229
They went in,
blew everyone away!

01:01:55.264 --> 01:01:56.572
The wrong house!

01:01:56.797 --> 01:01:59.996
They got the Wong house.

01:01:59.997 --> 01:02:01.917
They got the Wong house.

01:02:03.837 --> 01:02:06.429
Shit, man. Lighten up.

01:02:06.464 --> 01:02:09.021
Where the hell was I?

01:02:11.069 --> 01:02:15.356
Yeah.
I think I was, uh--

01:02:42.238 --> 01:02:44.062
This piece of shit
was going to cut you up.

01:02:44.158 --> 01:02:46.078
Now you fucking do it.

01:02:46.113 --> 01:02:48.495
Do it!

01:02:48.530 --> 01:02:50.878
Fuck!

01:02:59.199 --> 01:03:01.054
Dallas was right.

01:03:15.871 --> 01:03:17.724
Hello.

01:03:17.759 --> 01:03:19.998
- Hey, Case.
- Nick!

01:03:20.191 --> 01:03:22.524
Man, it's good
to hear from you!

01:03:22.559 --> 01:03:24.766
Goddamn.
I just wanted to tell you...

01:03:24.991 --> 01:03:27.324
- how much I enjoyed your visit.
- I know you're pissed.

01:03:27.359 --> 01:03:30.239
Pissed? Oh, no, I'm not pissed. If you
hadn't brought your friends along...

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:32.223
what would I have done
with my day, man?

01:03:32.512 --> 01:03:36.960
I'd a missed out on being beaten and
raped, abused, tied up, generally fucked up.

01:03:36.995 --> 01:03:40.192
- Casey-- - Not to mention
what you done for my house.

01:03:40.384 --> 01:03:42.720
What would you call it?
Early-Gothic horror.

01:03:42.847 --> 01:03:45.150
I don't have time for this shit.

01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:47.071
I'm dead.

01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:50.144
Unless I make this next plane,
you can write me off.

01:03:50.432 --> 01:03:53.312
- There's still a chance for you.
- Where's the money, Nick?

01:03:53.408 --> 01:03:57.120
That's why I'm calling you.
I stole it from the cops,

01:03:57.155 --> 01:03:59.537
and they ain't
real happy about it.

01:03:59.572 --> 01:04:01.706
They're going
to be coming after you.

01:04:01.741 --> 01:04:03.840
They already hit
the house next door.

01:04:03.875 --> 01:04:05.725
It's only a matter of time.

01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:08.640
- What about the fucks you stole the shit from?
- Oh, they're dead.

01:04:08.832 --> 01:04:12.096
Unfortunately, the niggers
who they work for ain't.

01:04:12.131 --> 01:04:15.360
They're going to find you too,
sooner or later.

01:04:15.361 --> 01:04:18.241
Come on, man.
Where's the money?

01:04:18.276 --> 01:04:20.161
I hid it.

01:04:21.152 --> 01:04:23.037
I want you to get out
of town for a while.

01:04:23.072 --> 01:04:26.431
Take a vacation--
A second honeymoon. Something.

01:04:26.721 --> 01:04:29.792
One day when you're sitting
on a beach sipping a cold one,

01:04:29.793 --> 01:04:33.152
spare tire around your waist,
think about me, bro.

01:04:33.408 --> 01:04:36.192
- Where you going, Nick?
- Can't tell you.

01:04:36.384 --> 01:04:40.320
Your car's at I.A.H.
in short-term parking.

01:04:40.321 --> 01:04:44.256
There's a flight leaving
for Paris tonight at 8:05.

01:04:44.481 --> 01:04:47.041
If I were you,
I would be on it.

01:04:47.073 --> 01:04:51.841
- I got to go.
- Hey, Nick, you really getting married, man?

01:04:51.876 --> 01:04:55.488
No, man.

01:04:56.546 --> 01:04:58.561
Not my style.

01:05:08.193 --> 01:05:10.113
Nick?

01:05:13.826 --> 01:05:15.649
I love you, Case.

01:05:15.842 --> 01:05:19.647
I'm sorry about the shit.

01:05:19.682 --> 01:05:22.562
Maybe one day
I'll make it up to you.

01:05:24.482 --> 01:05:26.402
I got to go.

01:05:33.122 --> 01:05:35.042
Adios.

01:05:36.162 --> 01:05:38.978
Nick--

01:05:39.013 --> 01:05:41.331
Nick?

01:05:41.366 --> 01:05:43.649
Nick?

01:07:07.204 --> 01:07:09.219
Oh, fuck.

01:07:21.605 --> 01:07:22.692
Just a minute.

01:07:38.917 --> 01:07:40.772
Oh, shit, that's cold.

01:07:46.565 --> 01:07:48.485
Mr. Wells.

01:07:49.445 --> 01:07:53.285
Detective Kasarov.
May I come in?

01:07:53.286 --> 01:07:55.206
Sure.

01:07:59.046 --> 01:08:01.926
This is a nice place you got here.

01:08:01.961 --> 01:08:03.846
I like the mailbox-- cute.

01:08:03.881 --> 01:08:05.731
My wife's idea.

01:08:05.766 --> 01:08:08.646
I'll have to drive
my wife by sometime.

01:08:08.681 --> 01:08:10.566
She'd-- She'd love it.

01:08:25.926 --> 01:08:28.741
- Feel better now?
- Tons.

01:08:28.805 --> 01:08:31.651
Keep yours.
It's a gesture.

01:08:31.685 --> 01:08:35.526
- Mind if I get something to drink?
- No, no. Help yourself.

01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:38.406
Casey, why don't you
take a peek in that bag?

01:08:38.407 --> 01:08:40.327
I got a little
something for you.

01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:50.694
Soy milk.
I just love soy milk.

01:08:50.917 --> 01:08:53.573
You know, one of my kids
is lactose-intolerant.

01:08:53.703 --> 01:08:55.654
So I ended up getting
hooked on the shit.

01:08:55.910 --> 01:08:59.046
Couldn't get enough of it.

01:08:59.303 --> 01:09:02.407
I don't get too much anymore.
Mmm.

01:09:04.327 --> 01:09:06.247
Ahh!

01:09:07.943 --> 01:09:10.051
Well--

01:09:10.087 --> 01:09:11.011
Why don't we...

01:09:11.046 --> 01:09:13.926
handle our business like
a couple of grown-ups.

01:09:13.962 --> 01:09:16.807
I mean, Casey, you know
I didn't pop over here...

01:09:16.935 --> 01:09:18.727
for some social visit.

01:09:18.854 --> 01:09:22.919
Your friend, Nicky,
stole a lot of money from us.

01:09:24.359 --> 01:09:26.407
Killed a few officers
in the process.

01:09:26.408 --> 01:09:29.319
Deaths we can overlook.

01:09:29.354 --> 01:09:31.462
Okay?

01:09:31.687 --> 01:09:34.084
But we want our money back.

01:09:34.118 --> 01:09:36.999
Like I've been telling everybody
come through here--

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:41.768
I realize you don't have it,
but you know where it is.

01:09:41.803 --> 01:09:44.648
Somewhere in the deepest
recesses of your brain,

01:09:44.743 --> 01:09:47.528
you know.

01:09:47.656 --> 01:09:52.328
You can't tell me after all the time
you spent with Nicky...

01:09:52.363 --> 01:09:54.247
you don't know
how his mind worked.

01:09:54.376 --> 01:09:56.232
You just figure it out.

01:09:58.088 --> 01:10:02.888
- I'm telling you-- - I know how much
you're doing to clean up your act.

01:10:02.923 --> 01:10:05.768
And I venture to guess that--

01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:08.648
that your good-looking wife
doesn't even know about your past.

01:10:09.929 --> 01:10:11.624
Right?

01:10:11.849 --> 01:10:15.400
Tell you what, Casey,
I want to make you a deal.

01:10:15.435 --> 01:10:20.520
You have that money
here tonight at 7:00,

01:10:20.809 --> 01:10:23.049
And I'll make this fuckin'
nightmare disappear.

01:10:24.969 --> 01:10:28.809
- Where do you got the bodies?
- In the garage.

01:10:28.844 --> 01:10:30.729
Let's go.

01:10:33.609 --> 01:10:36.232
What the fuck is this?

01:10:36.458 --> 01:10:40.329
I didn't know
what to do with them.

01:10:42.729 --> 01:10:45.449
Well, I'll tell you
something, Casey.

01:10:45.609 --> 01:10:49.145
If I was you, I'd clean up
this mess, because your wife's...

01:10:49.180 --> 01:10:52.681
going to come home and
she's not going to be very happy.

01:10:52.841 --> 01:10:54.726
Any suggestions?

01:10:54.761 --> 01:10:58.569
Well, I'll tell you,
if, uh, I'm not mistaken...

01:10:58.570 --> 01:11:01.450
I think today's garbage day.

01:11:10.602 --> 01:11:12.457
7:00.

01:11:13.930 --> 01:11:15.850
Sharp.

01:11:17.194 --> 01:11:19.690
And if I don't find it?

01:11:21.610 --> 01:11:24.298
Casey, I'd try real hard.

01:11:25.931 --> 01:11:29.642
How do I know all of this
is going to disappear?

01:11:29.898 --> 01:11:32.105
Don't be late.

01:12:34.924 --> 01:12:37.547
One day, when you're sitting
on a beach sipping a cold one,

01:12:37.804 --> 01:12:39.596
a spare tire around your waist,

01:12:39.757 --> 01:12:43.244
think about me, bro.

01:13:01.837 --> 01:13:04.332
You're good, Nick.

01:13:04.333 --> 01:13:07.821
You're very, very good.

01:13:25.486 --> 01:13:28.301
"Sorry I missed it. Nick."

01:13:36.942 --> 01:13:38.318
Whew.

01:13:49.454 --> 01:13:53.166
"Never forget who you are, man.
You do, you die."

01:13:53.294 --> 01:13:55.822
"Love, Nick."

01:14:26.894 --> 01:14:28.779
Who the fuck's this?

01:14:28.814 --> 01:14:31.694
This is the motherfucker
who killed the ganja man.

01:14:33.615 --> 01:14:36.495
I got your shit,
motherfucker.

01:14:37.359 --> 01:14:39.310
Yeah?
Then if you do,

01:14:39.407 --> 01:14:41.262
you have one mil
at my casa at 7:00,

01:14:41.327 --> 01:14:43.822
'cause I'm auctioning
the shit off.

01:14:44.079 --> 01:14:45.967
My name is Casey Wells.

01:14:46.127 --> 01:14:48.974
You can't find me,
you don't get to bid.

01:14:48.975 --> 01:14:51.823
7:00.
Don't be late.

01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:23.568
Looks like it's just
you and me, partner.

01:15:36.016 --> 01:15:37.936
All right, Casey. Time's up.

01:15:39.856 --> 01:15:42.160
He's in the kitchen!

01:16:54.738 --> 01:16:56.658
Casey, what are you doing here?

01:16:56.693 --> 01:16:58.543
Can I speak with you a minute?

01:16:58.578 --> 01:17:01.458
I'm kind of in the middle
of something here, Casey.

01:17:03.378 --> 01:17:07.090
Casey, you remember Allen?
Hey, Allen, excuse us.

01:17:08.402 --> 01:17:12.050
God, of all the times
you decide to spaz out.

01:17:12.051 --> 01:17:14.931
- Whose car?
- It was Nick's. I'm borrowing it.

01:17:14.966 --> 01:17:16.816
It's not important.
Here's the deal.

01:17:16.851 --> 01:17:19.731
I'm going to France.
My plane leaves in one hour.

01:17:19.766 --> 01:17:22.543
I miss it,
I won't be going anywhere.

01:17:22.578 --> 01:17:24.498
What? Your little friend's
gotten you in trouble, hasn't he?

01:17:26.418 --> 01:17:28.338
God.

01:17:30.259 --> 01:17:32.115
What, are you just going
to go with or without me?

01:17:32.179 --> 01:17:35.571
I got no choice.
Line in the sand, Chris.

01:17:35.795 --> 01:17:37.938
For better or for worse.

01:17:37.939 --> 01:17:40.339
That's your decision.

01:17:42.836 --> 01:17:44.851
I love you.

01:17:46.579 --> 01:17:48.819
You're asking me
to throw away my life.

01:17:49.011 --> 01:17:52.371
This has got its own reward.
Now, I got to know.

01:17:52.372 --> 01:17:54.739
You in or you out?

01:17:59.059 --> 01:18:01.299
Time's up. I got to go.

01:18:01.491 --> 01:18:03.858
Casey, wait.

01:18:07.699 --> 01:18:10.131
Last chance.

01:18:11.540 --> 01:18:14.868
- I won't lose you, Casey.
- Good choice, Chris.

01:18:16.340 --> 01:18:18.452
Let's see what's behind
door number one.

01:18:21.140 --> 01:18:23.060
Oh, my God.

01:18:23.284 --> 01:18:24.979
How much?

01:18:24.980 --> 01:18:26.897
Two million dollars.

01:18:26.932 --> 01:18:31.732
- I guess we won't be too miserable.
- Did you rob a bank?

01:18:31.733 --> 01:18:35.573
No. I'll tell you all about it...
everything.

01:18:35.608 --> 01:18:38.420
We got to catch that plane!

01:18:38.517 --> 01:18:40.724
Oh, my God--

01:18:41.012 --> 01:18:43.956
Sorry, Allen, I have to miss
that dinner tomorrow night.

01:18:44.180 --> 01:18:45.140
Looks like I'll be out of town.

01:19:01.462 --> 01:19:03.877
So, how was your day?

01:19:03.912 --> 01:19:06.542
I closed the account.

01:19:06.577 --> 01:19:08.802
I'm really happy for you.

01:19:08.837 --> 01:19:11.028
Oh, I didn't know you cared.

01:19:11.317 --> 01:19:13.013
Sweetheart--

01:19:13.014 --> 01:19:16.822
There are a lot of things
you don't know about me.

01:19:16.857 --> 01:19:18.279
# Run, mister, run. #

01:19:18.314 --> 01:19:19.583
# Somebody said. #

01:19:19.618 --> 01:19:20.853
# Somebody said. #

01:19:21.142 --> 01:19:25.462
# Stop at the green lights
and go at the red. #

01:19:25.497 --> 01:19:30.262
# I must admit
I'm a little uneasy. #

01:19:30.297 --> 01:19:34.710
# I tried to warn you. #

01:19:34.965 --> 01:19:38.901
# I tried to say. #

01:19:38.902 --> 01:19:43.733
# I tried to say. #

01:19:43.734 --> 01:19:47.765
# Here comes my lucky day. #

01:19:47.991 --> 01:19:52.339
# Here comes the rainbow. #

01:19:52.374 --> 01:19:57.142
# We're riding high
on our own. #

01:20:01.079 --> 01:20:05.351
# Here comes my lucky day. #

01:20:05.386 --> 01:20:09.623
# Here comes the rainbow. #

01:20:09.751 --> 01:20:14.423
# We're riding high
on our own. #
