00:09.427 --> 00:12.847
unleashed an unspeakable evil.

00:13.181 --> 00:16.100
But a foolish Samurai warrior

00:16.184 --> 00:18.436

00:18.645 --> 00:21.356

where my evil is law.

Now, the fool seeks to return to the past,

00:38.456 --> 00:43.044

Would you like to hear it?

06:48.492 --> 06:49.493
Okay.

06:50.119 --> 06:53.164
Long, long ago,
in the land of my ancestors,

06:53.247 --> 06:55.791
there lived an old woodcutter
and his wife.

06:56.250 --> 06:58.753
They loved each other very much.

06:59.295 --> 07:02.465
Yet they were often sad,
for they had no children.

07:03.341 --> 07:04.342
But one day,

07:04.550 --> 07:06.761
the king of heaven smiled upon them,

07:07.136 --> 07:08.471
and sent a gift.

07:08.554 --> 07:11.265
As the old woman was washing
some clothes by the river,

07:11.807 --> 07:14.477
a huge peach came floating downstream.

07:15.645 --> 07:16.729
She took it home with her.

07:17.146 --> 07:19.899
And when her husband returned home
from chopping wood that evening,

07:20.441 --> 07:22.568
she presented the giant peach for supper.

07:23.653 --> 07:25.655
"I have never seen
such a marvelous fruit,"

07:25.738 --> 07:26.822
exclaimed the old man.

07:27.406 --> 07:28.783
"Let us taste it right away."

07:28.866 --> 07:30.785
But just before they could slice it,

07:31.202 --> 07:32.370
the peach popped open,

07:33.162 --> 07:36.165
and there stood a beautiful baby boy.

07:37.208 --> 07:39.293
The old couple were shocked,
to say the least.

07:39.502 --> 07:41.045
"Don't worry," said the boy.

07:41.587 --> 07:44.006
"I have been sent from heaven
to be your son."

07:44.340 --> 07:46.133
The couple were overjoyed,

07:46.342 --> 07:49.053
and named their new son Momotaro,

07:49.470 --> 07:51.222
which means "Peach Boy."

07:51.806 --> 07:53.724
They loved him with all their hearts,

07:53.975 --> 07:56.852
and Momotaro grew into a fine, strong boy.

07:58.729 --> 08:01.399
One day, Peach Boy went to his parents.

08:02.066 --> 08:03.943
"Mother, Father," he said.

08:04.527 --> 08:07.321
"You have been so kind to me.
I want to repay you."

08:07.571 --> 08:10.616
He told them he wanted
to travel to Ogre Island,

08:10.866 --> 08:14.912
and rid the country of the terrible ogres
that robbed and pillaged the land.

08:15.246 --> 08:17.873
The old couple worried
for Momotaro's safety,

08:17.957 --> 08:20.543
but they knew he was a special boy.

08:22.878 --> 08:24.213
Along his travels,

08:24.296 --> 08:27.883
Momotaro came across a hungry dog
who meant to bite him.

08:28.134 --> 08:32.138
But he gave the dog one of the dumplings
his mother had packed for him instead.

08:32.596 --> 08:35.641
"I am going to fight the ogres
on Ogre Island," said Momotaro.

08:35.933 --> 08:38.394
"Then, I will help you,"
said the grateful dog.

08:40.521 --> 08:44.442
Soon they met an angry monkey,
who threw sticks at them.

08:44.525 --> 08:46.694
Momotaro threw a dumpling
back at the monkey.

08:47.153 --> 08:49.572
The monkey's mood quickly changed.

08:50.031 --> 08:51.782
And when he learned
of where they were going,

08:52.324 --> 08:54.869
the monkey vowed to help them
fight the ogres, too.

08:58.039 --> 09:01.542
As the three left the forest,
they met a vigilant pheasant.

09:02.960 --> 09:05.421
The pheasant turned out
to be fond of dumplings,

09:05.755 --> 09:07.715
but not fond of ogres at all,

09:08.591 --> 09:11.177
and decided to join Momotaro
on his mission.

09:13.262 --> 09:15.347
When the band of adventurers
reached the sea,

09:15.723 --> 09:17.933
they went to work building a boat,

09:18.267 --> 09:21.604
and soon set sail for Ogre Island.

09:22.063 --> 09:24.190
Momotaro and his friends came ashore,

09:24.273 --> 09:26.692
and found an ominous fortress,

09:27.318 --> 09:30.154
full of terrible ogres of all kinds.

09:34.200 --> 09:38.496
The gate was well-guarded,
but Peach Boy devised a plan.

09:38.788 --> 09:41.707
Pheasant flew over the walls
and attacked the guards.

09:42.208 --> 09:43.667
The ogres swung at him,

09:43.751 --> 09:46.128
but the quick pheasant dodged their blows.

09:46.337 --> 09:47.713
With the guards distracted,

09:48.089 --> 09:51.050
Monkey climbed the wall
and unlocked the gate,

09:51.133 --> 09:53.969
so that Momotaro
and spotted dog could charge in,

09:54.053 --> 09:55.930
and take the ogres by surprise.

09:56.097 --> 09:58.599
It was a terrible battle.

09:58.766 --> 10:00.351
Pheasant pecked the ogres' heads.

10:01.268 --> 10:02.603
Dog bit at them.

10:02.895 --> 10:04.688
Monkey clawed their faces.

10:05.231 --> 10:08.359
And Momotaro swung at them
with his father's ax.

10:08.567 --> 10:11.445
At last, the ogres surrendered.

10:12.029 --> 10:14.406
They bowed before Momotaro in defeat,

10:14.490 --> 10:17.409
and gave him all the treasure
they had stolen,

10:18.160 --> 10:20.704
promising to never do wicked deeds again.

10:21.956 --> 10:24.542
The four friends heaped
the treasure onto their boat,

10:24.959 --> 10:28.754
and sailed home to give it back
to the people of Peach Boy's land.

10:29.839 --> 10:33.467
The woodcutter and his wife were overjoyed
to see their son return safely.

10:33.759 --> 10:35.136
And with Momotaro home,

10:35.386 --> 10:39.181
he and his family lived
very, very happily.

(OGRES LAUGHING)

18:51.465 --> 18:52.883
(INTENSE MUSIC PLAYING)

18:53.133 --> 18:54.134

My baby!

Oh, thank you, kind sir.

21:14.441 --> 21:16.651
