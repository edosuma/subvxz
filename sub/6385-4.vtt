00:00.882 --> 00:02.183
<i>Previously on Californication...</i>

00:02.217 --> 00:04.101
- So this is where you work.
- You want to come inside?

00:04.135 --> 00:06.220
Would that involve seeing you naked?

00:06.254 --> 00:07.888
- Oh, most definitely.
- I think not.

00:07.922 --> 00:10.975
In the interest of
student-teacher relations.

00:11.026 --> 00:14.361
Hank... Hank!

00:14.396 --> 00:15.813
Yes, Fraulein?

00:15.864 --> 00:18.782
Tonight, my house,
English department fall mixer.

00:18.817 --> 00:20.034
How many jobs do you have, lady?

00:20.068 --> 00:21.735
You got a paper route too?

00:21.769 --> 00:22.953
Did you two come together?

00:22.988 --> 00:24.788
No.
We just came in together.

00:28.543 --> 00:30.995
Oops.

00:35.217 --> 00:36.417
I fucking hate you!

00:36.451 --> 00:38.385
Okay, I'll just...
I'll move back in.

00:38.420 --> 00:40.254
I do my thing,
you do yours.

00:40.288 --> 00:41.555
Fine by me.

00:41.590 --> 00:42.673
Aah!

00:42.724 --> 00:45.175
No means no, you know!

00:45.227 --> 00:46.393
Is this the surprise
you were talking about?

00:46.428 --> 00:47.678
I signed a big fish today.

00:47.729 --> 00:49.013
Oh, well, good for you.

00:49.064 --> 00:50.648
Maybe you can move the fuck out now.

00:50.682 --> 00:53.817
Come on.

00:53.852 --> 00:54.852
I was looking for Charlie.

00:54.903 --> 00:58.355
Charlie, are you inside that woman?

00:58.406 --> 00:59.740
I can explain.

01:16.541 --> 01:18.959
Bob's your uncle. Oh...

01:18.993 --> 01:21.795
Oh, hey... Felicio.

01:21.829 --> 01:24.048
Looks like you caught me
doing a little... ahh...

01:24.099 --> 01:25.549
pre-class meditato.

01:25.600 --> 01:27.017
We should talk.

01:27.052 --> 01:28.686
Oh, shit,
you're not preggers, are you?

01:28.720 --> 01:31.055
Hank, we kissed.
That was all.

01:31.106 --> 01:32.556
Well, technically speaking,
you kissed me,

01:32.607 --> 01:33.641
for what it's worth.

01:33.675 --> 01:36.193
I've never done that before.

01:36.227 --> 01:37.311
Wow, you never kissed a man?

01:37.345 --> 01:38.362
Now, that's just plain weird.

01:38.396 --> 01:39.780
What, are you a hooker or something?

01:39.814 --> 01:41.815
'Cause hookers don't kiss.
Neither do marines.

01:41.849 --> 01:43.317
That's the best gay
porn title I ever heard:

01:43.351 --> 01:44.318
"Marines don't kiss."

01:44.352 --> 01:45.653
What I'm saying is,

01:45.687 --> 01:47.655
I've never stepped outside
of my marriage before.

01:47.689 --> 01:49.740
Well, of course not. Duh.

01:49.791 --> 01:51.325
Who in their right mind would step out

01:51.359 --> 01:52.826
on his royal deanness?

01:52.860 --> 01:55.913
Look, I know Stacy's not
exactly of your tribe.

01:55.964 --> 01:57.965
But once upon a time I was
very much in love with the man.

01:57.999 --> 01:59.032
Yeah.

01:59.050 --> 02:01.168
Before he cheated on me,
that is.

02:01.202 --> 02:02.836
Whoa, Nelly!

02:02.870 --> 02:04.138
Are you trying to tell me that

02:04.172 --> 02:06.039
that smarmy piece of wiener cheese

02:06.057 --> 02:07.224
took his love to town?

02:07.258 --> 02:09.342
Oldest story in the book,
I'm afraid.

02:09.377 --> 02:10.844
He fell for one of his students.

02:10.877 --> 02:11.979
We got through it, though.

02:12.013 --> 02:13.597
Counseling, couples therapy.

02:13.648 --> 02:15.316
Over-intellectualizing the whole thing

02:15.350 --> 02:16.684
to an absurd degree.

02:16.718 --> 02:18.152
We're really quite good at that.

02:18.186 --> 02:20.387
Wow, rock on with your bad selves.

02:20.405 --> 02:22.856
That's... that's awesome,
but I'm guessing

02:22.890 --> 02:25.909
that you feel like you're...
owed one.

02:25.944 --> 02:28.395
Like you got this "get
out of jail free" card,

02:28.413 --> 02:31.115
and you just don't know
how or when to use it?

02:31.166 --> 02:34.001
Or maybe I do.

02:34.035 --> 02:35.002
Oh, well, shucks.

02:35.036 --> 02:37.254
Uh, I...
I'd be flattered,

02:37.288 --> 02:40.674
but I try not to involve myself

02:40.709 --> 02:43.711
in other people's domestic strife.

02:43.745 --> 02:44.878
Really, Hank?

02:44.912 --> 02:46.296
I haven't known you all that long,

02:46.348 --> 02:48.549
but that doesn't seem like
part of your programming.

02:48.583 --> 02:50.100
That's the thing.
It's a relatively new thing

02:50.135 --> 02:52.419
based on a shitload of
really horrible experiences.

02:52.437 --> 02:54.555
- But it's a thing nonetheless.
- Hmm.

02:54.589 --> 02:57.107
And who says I'd ever
cash in such a chit

02:57.142 --> 02:58.142
on the likes of you?

02:58.193 --> 03:00.728
Whoa. Well, uh...

03:00.762 --> 03:03.930
I would be the lucky one if you would.

03:03.948 --> 03:06.450
I mean,
you're a great broad, Felicia.

03:06.484 --> 03:08.369
You deserve to be happier.

03:08.403 --> 03:10.571
- Mm...
- Uh-Oh.

03:15.160 --> 03:17.378
Why can't I stop kissing you?

03:17.412 --> 03:18.712
Oh, it's not your fault.

03:18.747 --> 03:22.049
I'm like flypaper for the
emotionally disturbed.

03:23.785 --> 03:26.253
- Oop.
- Ow, that's my balls.

03:26.287 --> 03:29.590
Oh, hey,
am I interrupting something?

03:29.624 --> 03:32.226
Just some furtive fucking.

03:32.260 --> 03:34.678
- I'll come back.
- Please. This fellow?

03:34.729 --> 03:37.765
Give a girl some credit.

03:37.799 --> 03:39.183
I have to go to class.

03:39.234 --> 03:42.986
Okay. Ta.

03:43.021 --> 03:44.238
We should talk.

03:44.272 --> 03:45.656
Oh, shit,
you're not preggers, are you?

03:45.690 --> 03:48.192
What are you talking about?
You said you were snipped.

03:48.243 --> 03:50.577
Phew, that's a relief.

03:50.612 --> 03:52.279
We can't do that anymore.

03:52.313 --> 03:53.947
You're right.
We should not.

03:53.981 --> 03:57.835
I mean, we could lose our jobs,
our homes...

03:57.869 --> 03:59.369
our citizenship.

03:59.421 --> 04:00.921
Yeah, I know.

04:00.955 --> 04:02.423
I was more thinking along the lines

04:02.457 --> 04:04.291
that I haven't had the sex in a while.

04:04.325 --> 04:06.093
And the other night was kind of like

04:06.127 --> 04:07.711
waking a sleeping tiger.

04:07.762 --> 04:10.214
If we're not gonna be doing
it on a regular basis,

04:10.265 --> 04:11.932
I don't think we should
be doing it at all.

04:11.966 --> 04:13.500
You know what I mean?

04:13.518 --> 04:15.552
I do know what you mean,

04:15.603 --> 04:18.856
but that whole waking
the sleeping tiger thing

04:18.890 --> 04:21.442
got me hard.

04:21.476 --> 04:25.028
Mm. And I'm wet.

04:25.063 --> 04:27.564
Hard and wet,
that's a winning combination.

04:27.615 --> 04:31.819
That's like cookies and cream, or...

04:31.853 --> 04:32.903
Lennon and McCartney.

04:32.954 --> 04:34.154
Mm.

05:20.952 --> 05:23.370
Hank, I've been making some
phone calls on your behalf.

05:23.404 --> 05:25.122
And guess what.

05:25.173 --> 05:27.624
People think you're a cunt.
No joke.

05:27.675 --> 05:29.293
Now, here's what I think
we should do.

05:29.344 --> 05:32.930
There's a lot of dried up
Hollywood snatch out there

05:32.964 --> 05:33.964
in need of watering.

05:34.015 --> 05:35.716
Powerful older women

05:35.750 --> 05:38.435
whose limp-dicked husbands
have long since stopped

05:38.469 --> 05:40.304
tending their gardens.

05:40.355 --> 05:44.441
And they want someone
young, dumb, full of come.

05:44.475 --> 05:46.727
That's where you come in.

05:46.761 --> 05:49.613
Now, I think we should
send you around town,

05:49.647 --> 05:52.032
these executive suites,

05:52.066 --> 05:55.402
and you charm your way
into the hearts, minds,

05:55.436 --> 05:58.155
and pants of these unfuckable monsters.

05:58.206 --> 05:59.957
Next thing you know,
my phone is ringing

05:59.991 --> 06:02.075
for Hank Moody.

06:02.109 --> 06:04.044
So you're suggesting that I
dump this whole writer thing

06:04.078 --> 06:06.246
and reinvent myself as a
Hollywood man-whore?

06:06.280 --> 06:07.714
Oh, abso-fuckin'-lutely.

06:10.585 --> 06:12.302
And then we turn around
and we sell your story

06:12.337 --> 06:14.171
as a modern day American gigolo.

06:14.222 --> 06:16.640
- What do you think?
- What are you guys doing?

06:16.674 --> 06:18.559
You playing footsie?

06:18.593 --> 06:20.093
She's playing footsie,
not me.

06:20.127 --> 06:22.346
Oh, we're not dating.
Just fucking.

06:22.397 --> 06:23.430
Really?

06:23.464 --> 06:25.983
- Just the once.
- Oh, bullshit.

06:26.017 --> 06:28.402
I gave you two blow jobs in one night.

06:28.436 --> 06:31.572
And you ate this pussy
like your mama made it.

06:32.774 --> 06:34.908
Oh, holy fuckballs!
I got a lunch.

06:34.943 --> 06:38.144
Kristofferson.
My most loyal client.

06:38.162 --> 06:41.114
Oh, God, I get in a puddle
just thinking about it.

06:41.148 --> 06:43.667
Oh, Runkle, now,
don't be jealous.

06:43.701 --> 06:45.485
I think we should keep emotion out

06:45.503 --> 06:46.503
of this thing of ours.

06:46.537 --> 06:47.921
Good idea, Sue.

06:47.956 --> 06:49.039
I'm totally with you on that.

06:49.090 --> 06:50.674
Yeah.
What are you doing later, Hank?

06:50.708 --> 06:52.676
- Uh...
- Party at my place.

06:52.710 --> 06:55.762
Why don't you stop by for
a steak and a blow job?

06:55.797 --> 06:58.882
I'd love to see you and Runkle
with your swords crossed.

06:58.933 --> 07:03.053
Collini out.

07:03.104 --> 07:05.055
What the fuck is going on,
big boy?

07:05.106 --> 07:08.642
Just goin' with the flow.

07:08.676 --> 07:09.943
Hey, I gotta go pick up Becca.

07:09.978 --> 07:11.395
I promised her I'd take her shopping.

07:11.446 --> 07:12.479
You want to hit
a strip club later?

07:12.513 --> 07:14.564
- Buh-Buh-Sheeure.
- Yeah.

07:14.616 --> 07:15.866
That sounds like a good time.

07:15.900 --> 07:17.200
Yeah, I got a student that works at one.

07:17.235 --> 07:18.652
Of course you do.

07:18.686 --> 07:20.320
She dropped my class...
I think she did...

07:20.354 --> 07:21.738
and I'm perturbed.
I want to find out why.

07:21.789 --> 07:23.657
But I can't go alone.
That would be unseemly.

07:23.691 --> 07:24.741
Agreed.

07:24.792 --> 07:26.994
Hey, hey,
you gonna buy me a lap dance?

07:27.028 --> 07:28.128
Maybe.

07:28.162 --> 07:30.047
If you promise not to
come in your pants.

07:30.081 --> 07:32.382
Moody out.

07:32.417 --> 07:35.052
Come on, Becca,
you're killing me softly here.

07:35.086 --> 07:37.721
Whoa.

07:37.755 --> 07:39.056
Okay, I'm gonna pretend
I didn't see that.

07:39.090 --> 07:40.891
Just bring my daughter back alive,

07:40.925 --> 07:41.892
and I won't call the cops.

07:41.926 --> 07:43.677
- Okay? I promise.
- Dad...

07:43.711 --> 07:46.179
You have no fashion sense whatsoever.

07:46.213 --> 07:47.981
I have excellent fashion sense.

07:48.016 --> 07:50.400
I know what works for me.
I have a uniform.

07:50.435 --> 07:51.985
And a massive brain tumor.

07:52.020 --> 07:53.770
Why, because I don't want
to see half your butt crack

07:53.821 --> 07:55.272
every time you get out of the car?

07:55.323 --> 07:56.323
All right, fine.
I'm guilty.

07:56.357 --> 07:58.558
- Call me crazy.
- May i?

07:58.576 --> 08:00.827
May you what,
butt into our conversation?

08:00.862 --> 08:02.779
Sure. Feel free.
Go ahead.

08:02.830 --> 08:05.699
She looks amazing.

08:05.733 --> 08:08.085
See? What she said.

08:08.119 --> 08:10.420
Well, of course she looks amazing...

08:10.455 --> 08:13.907
to the tune of...
200 quatloos?

08:13.925 --> 08:15.876
Jesus Christ,
if I didn't already object

08:15.910 --> 08:17.627
on moral and religious grounds,

08:17.679 --> 08:19.463
I'm never gonna spend that
kind of money on clothes.

08:19.514 --> 08:21.548
You promised you'd take me shopping.

08:21.582 --> 08:24.351
Yes, honey, but I thought
that meant, you know,

08:24.385 --> 08:26.603
buying a few t-shirts at Hot Topic

08:26.637 --> 08:28.972
and grabbing an orange julius
or something like that.

08:29.023 --> 08:31.942
I'm not that girl anymore, dad.

08:31.976 --> 08:33.977
She's not that girl anymore, dad.

08:34.028 --> 08:35.361
Thanks for the help, shopkeep.

08:35.395 --> 08:37.981
Look, um,
I think I see someone over there

08:38.032 --> 08:40.984
in the market for a $250
Jethro tull t-shirt.

08:41.034 --> 08:42.152
And by the way,
I was at that show.

08:42.203 --> 08:43.602
I paid all of ten bucks for the shirt.

08:43.621 --> 08:45.906
Go. Exploit. Be gone.

08:45.940 --> 08:47.491
I hate you.

08:47.542 --> 08:49.576
Becs? Bexster?

08:49.610 --> 08:51.912
Hey, listen, why don't we, um,
go for a little walk and talk,

08:51.946 --> 08:53.330
and I'll, uh...

08:53.381 --> 08:54.998
I'll get you one of those
hot dogs on a stick

08:55.049 --> 08:56.917
that you like?

08:56.951 --> 08:59.052
Or that you used to love, anyway.

08:59.087 --> 09:01.454
I don't even know.
I'm giving up. That's it.

09:05.343 --> 09:07.177
- Wow.
- There.

09:07.228 --> 09:09.813
Are you happy now?

09:09.847 --> 09:10.897
Sort of.

09:10.932 --> 09:13.967
But not really.
Not if you're not.

09:13.985 --> 09:16.269
You can't have it both ways, dad.

09:18.189 --> 09:19.356
Are you expecting someone?

09:19.407 --> 09:20.473
Godot.

09:20.491 --> 09:23.660
Oh, Godot. Ho ho.
That's not bad.

09:23.694 --> 09:27.814
- Hey, Chelsea.
- I want to show you something.

09:27.832 --> 09:29.416
We're working on her manners.

09:29.450 --> 09:31.701
Hideous creatures,
these teenage girls.

09:31.753 --> 09:34.037
Monstrous.
Couldn't agree with you more.

09:34.088 --> 09:35.172
Is it too late drown them in the tub?

09:35.206 --> 09:37.207
Would you like some tea or sherry or...

09:37.258 --> 09:40.326
- What is it, pimm?
- Oh, no, thanks.

09:40.344 --> 09:41.545
I heard about the fight.

09:41.596 --> 09:44.047
Oh, "fight."
Not... not really a fight.

09:44.098 --> 09:46.833
It was more like a disagreement.

09:46.851 --> 09:47.851
Caring out loud, really.

09:47.885 --> 09:49.936
Let me take her shopping with us.

09:49.971 --> 09:52.672
Oh, no.
Your daughter looks like a trollop.

09:52.690 --> 09:54.691
That's... that's mean.

09:54.725 --> 09:57.060
I'm just kidding.
Not really.

09:57.111 --> 09:59.946
Come on, just tell me how much
you want to spend.

09:59.981 --> 10:02.532
I'll make the most of it,
and I'll make her look as...

10:02.567 --> 10:04.901
I don't know,
classy as humanly possible.

10:04.952 --> 10:06.153
- I don't know.
- Oh, come on.

10:06.187 --> 10:08.038
She's such a sweet girl
and misses her mother

10:08.072 --> 10:09.906
and doesn't know how
to talk to her father.

10:09.957 --> 10:11.124
She used to.

10:11.159 --> 10:13.710
Yeah, well, things change.
She's evolving.

10:13.744 --> 10:15.829
She's trying out
different personalities.

10:15.863 --> 10:17.631
You've got to adapt or die.

10:17.665 --> 10:19.382
Well, maybe I'll come with you.

10:19.417 --> 10:21.468
Absolutely not.
No. No, no, no.

10:21.502 --> 10:23.970
Besides, I wouldn't want her to see me

10:24.005 --> 10:26.506
pull you into a dark corner
and make out with you.

10:26.540 --> 10:30.260
You dirty english rose, you.

10:30.311 --> 10:35.065
It would appear that you
bring it out in me.

10:38.552 --> 10:40.720
You all ready?

10:45.693 --> 10:47.994
Can I go?

10:48.029 --> 10:50.030
Yes.

10:50.064 --> 10:52.616
See, I told you he
wasn't quite the asshole

10:52.667 --> 10:54.501
you said he was.

10:54.535 --> 10:56.670
Come along, girls.
Let's hit the road.

10:56.704 --> 11:00.340
That's Mr. Asshole to you, Chelsea.

11:00.374 --> 11:03.260
- Mm-Hmm.
- Yeah. Okay.

11:10.218 --> 11:12.802
Check it out.

11:12.854 --> 11:15.889
I think I can see where
they put the implants in.

11:15.923 --> 11:18.859
Ba-Jesus, it's like the
laces on a football.

11:18.893 --> 11:20.143
You gonna be like this all night?

11:20.194 --> 11:21.361
Hey, is Jackie working?

11:21.395 --> 11:23.613
Sorry, sweetie,
don't know any Jackie.

11:23.648 --> 11:25.315
You want a dance?

11:25.366 --> 11:27.234
Do you really think I would strip

11:27.268 --> 11:28.935
under my real name?

11:28.953 --> 11:32.038
Uh, sorry,
I don't know the protocol.

11:32.073 --> 11:34.241
- Well, you're forgiven.
- Hmm.

11:34.275 --> 11:36.442
Well, what is your
stripper handle, then?

11:36.460 --> 11:37.494
- Ashley.
- Ashley?

11:37.545 --> 11:39.663
- Ashley Madison.
- Ashley Madison.

11:39.714 --> 11:42.299
Meet my agent.
This is my student.

11:42.333 --> 11:43.550
Of course she is.

11:43.584 --> 11:46.303
You know,
I had a feeling you'd show up

11:46.337 --> 11:47.587
sooner or later.

11:47.621 --> 11:48.922
Is that why you dropped my class?

11:48.956 --> 11:52.092
Yeah, because I'm just
that obsessed with you.

11:52.126 --> 11:53.927
Listen, I really can't
sit around and chitchat

11:53.961 --> 11:54.961
all night.

11:54.979 --> 11:57.514
So you can buy a dance or hit the road.

11:57.565 --> 11:58.732
Come here, my agent.

11:58.766 --> 12:03.403
- Ooh...
- Oh, settle down.

12:03.437 --> 12:04.905
Okay, this is for me.

12:04.939 --> 12:08.074
And this... well,
let's go, here...

12:08.109 --> 12:09.826
This is for Ralph Baldo Emerson here.

12:09.860 --> 12:11.528
Come on, big guy.

12:13.698 --> 12:15.749
Oh...

12:23.424 --> 12:24.657
What happened to you?

12:24.675 --> 12:26.843
Nothing scandalous.

12:26.877 --> 12:29.596
- Writing's just not my thing.
- I beg to differ.

12:29.630 --> 12:31.631
Well, you can beg all you want,

12:31.665 --> 12:33.266
but it was an elective.

12:33.301 --> 12:35.685
I'm a business major.
I don't have time for it.

12:35.720 --> 12:38.138
Business?

12:38.172 --> 12:40.473
Who studies business
in this day and age?

12:40.507 --> 12:43.143
That feels really good,
by the way.

12:43.177 --> 12:44.527
- Nice work.
- Thanks.

12:44.562 --> 12:47.397
That there is a man boner.

12:47.448 --> 12:51.401
Mm, yeah, that's pretty much
what we shoot for in here.

12:51.452 --> 12:55.121
Look, I know what you're thinking.

12:55.156 --> 12:57.791
I'm not one of your typical
fucked-Up damage cases

12:57.825 --> 12:59.960
who's just lusting for male attention.

12:59.994 --> 13:01.628
I'm not saying those girls don't exist.

13:01.662 --> 13:04.864
Throw a rock in here and
you'll hit six or seven,

13:04.882 --> 13:06.833
but that's not me.

13:06.867 --> 13:11.037
I am just making the most of what I got

13:11.055 --> 13:12.672
while I still got it.

13:12.706 --> 13:16.726
Ahh... right.

13:16.761 --> 13:18.144
So what's next?

13:18.179 --> 13:20.764
- I get the hell out.
- Just like that?

13:20.815 --> 13:26.102
You're just gonna disappear
like a... topless salinger?

13:26.153 --> 13:28.271
The stripper in the rye.

13:28.322 --> 13:30.857
Hey, did you just come in your pants?

13:30.891 --> 13:32.742
What?
You were grinding...

13:32.777 --> 13:33.777
- Disgusting!
- I'm sorry.

13:33.828 --> 13:35.161
It was an exceptional lap dance.

13:35.196 --> 13:37.030
Freakin' gross!

13:37.064 --> 13:38.498
Nicely done, Runkle.

13:38.532 --> 13:40.617
It was a compliment.

13:40.668 --> 13:43.370
A liquid compliment.

13:43.404 --> 13:45.288
Hello?

13:45.339 --> 13:47.240
Hey, Marcy, baby!

13:47.258 --> 13:49.843
I'm at a strip club with Hank.

13:49.877 --> 13:53.797
I just got a lap dance.
It's awesome here.

13:53.848 --> 13:56.049
Really?

13:56.083 --> 13:57.750
No shit.

13:57.768 --> 13:59.636
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'll be right there.

13:59.687 --> 14:00.920
Hey, I gotta go.

14:00.938 --> 14:02.939
Somebody who came and saw the house

14:02.973 --> 14:04.391
is coming back for the
third time this week.

14:04.425 --> 14:05.692
I think they might make an offer.

14:05.726 --> 14:07.727
- Good luck, pal.
- No. Sticky fingers.

14:07.761 --> 14:09.646
Nice to meet you,
Ashley Madison.

14:13.034 --> 14:14.901
See, what did I tell you?

14:14.935 --> 14:16.202
Am I not awesome?

14:16.237 --> 14:19.739
Do I not provide a valid and
worthwhile public service?

14:19.773 --> 14:21.408
Yes, all that and more.

14:21.442 --> 14:23.543
But you're a damn fine writer too.

14:23.577 --> 14:25.495
So you say.

14:25.546 --> 14:27.464
But I don't really care about that.

14:27.498 --> 14:28.882
Well, maybe you should.

14:28.916 --> 14:31.334
- Maybe it's another way out.
- Of what?

14:31.385 --> 14:33.586
The hole you're desperately
trying to dig out of.

14:33.620 --> 14:35.171
Maybe not as fast,

14:35.222 --> 14:37.974
but the payoff will last
a lot longer, trust me.

14:38.008 --> 14:39.843
You know, I don't know
a thing about you, teach.

14:39.894 --> 14:42.729
Where you grew up,
what you believe in.

14:42.763 --> 14:45.098
But you really have no
idea where I come from.

14:45.132 --> 14:46.399
The shit I've seen.

14:46.434 --> 14:47.400
- Oh?
- Mm.

14:47.435 --> 14:48.902
All right, well, tell me.

14:48.936 --> 14:49.986
Why?

14:50.020 --> 14:52.605
It's boring as shit.

14:52.639 --> 14:53.773
I don't know, tell me.

14:53.807 --> 14:55.525
Okay, do you really want to hear

14:55.576 --> 14:57.643
about the father that I never knew?

14:57.661 --> 15:00.480
The mother who used to
clean rich people's houses

15:00.498 --> 15:03.333
to get me to college?

15:03.367 --> 15:05.452
Writing is just a...
it's a pipe dream.

15:05.486 --> 15:06.703
You can't really make a living

15:06.754 --> 15:08.538
doing something like that.

15:08.589 --> 15:11.925
Actually, that's how
you end up teaching.

15:11.959 --> 15:13.510
- Ouch.
- Mm.

15:13.544 --> 15:16.662
Instead, I would rather
retire my mother, you know.

15:16.680 --> 15:18.431
And if I have to use my body to do so,

15:18.466 --> 15:19.849
then so fucking be it.

15:19.884 --> 15:23.103
You know, I appreciate you
trying to help me unleash

15:23.137 --> 15:26.689
my inner Hemingway,
but I'm a big girl.

15:26.724 --> 15:28.441
You know,
I can take care of myself.

15:28.476 --> 15:31.561
Wow. I think you should
really get back into class.

15:31.612 --> 15:33.813
We could workshop that
little story of yours.

15:33.847 --> 15:35.899
I'm not sure I believe a word of it,

15:35.950 --> 15:37.117
but I dig the details.

15:37.151 --> 15:40.286
It was a pleasure meeting
you, Ashley, uh...

15:40.321 --> 15:41.354
Madison.

15:41.372 --> 15:45.458
- Ashley Madison.
- Mm-Hmm.

15:47.578 --> 15:49.579
Jesus, took you long enough.

15:49.630 --> 15:51.915
I'm sorry.
I had to call a cab.

15:51.966 --> 15:53.750
What's with the stain?

15:53.801 --> 15:57.420
Egh, don't bother.
I don't want to know.

15:57.471 --> 15:59.472
I'm on the rag,
and I'll start screaming.

15:59.507 --> 16:00.673
I don't want to scream.

16:00.707 --> 16:02.342
Okay, okay,
what can I do?

16:02.376 --> 16:04.644
Um, just make sure your
jerk off paraphernalia

16:04.678 --> 16:06.212
is all tucked away.

16:06.230 --> 16:07.347
Gone. Done. What else?

16:07.381 --> 16:10.016
Uh, that's it.

16:10.050 --> 16:12.101
I think I'm good with that.

16:12.153 --> 16:14.938
So this is it, huh?

16:14.989 --> 16:16.389
What?

16:16.407 --> 16:19.492
We're really gonna do this?
Sell the place?

16:19.527 --> 16:20.743
Isn't that what we want?

16:20.778 --> 16:22.695
Yeah, sure, I guess.

16:22.729 --> 16:23.863
Just, you know,
all of a sudden,

16:23.897 --> 16:25.698
a lot of memories
come flooding back.

16:25.732 --> 16:29.335
Some bad,
but so many good, really.

16:29.370 --> 16:30.870
Great even.

16:30.904 --> 16:33.173
Can you stop, Charlie?
Just stop, okay?

16:33.207 --> 16:34.924
'Cause I really don't
want to go traipsing

16:34.959 --> 16:37.076
down memory lane
with you right now.

16:37.094 --> 16:40.213
Ugh, I gotta go change
my fucking tampon.

16:47.221 --> 16:48.921
- Is that all you got?
- Come on.

16:48.939 --> 16:50.607
- Yeah, Ashley.
- Come on, Ashley.

16:50.641 --> 16:52.942
- Party. Yeah.
- Party with us.

16:52.977 --> 16:54.861
Hey, Jackie.

16:54.895 --> 16:56.813
You all right?

16:56.864 --> 16:58.031
Yeah. Fine.

16:58.065 --> 16:59.866
You know, big girl.
Can take care of myself.

16:59.900 --> 17:02.068
- Remember?
- You sure?

17:02.102 --> 17:03.203
Yeah.

17:03.237 --> 17:04.287
That means you can
take off now, old timer.

17:04.320 --> 17:06.990
Oh.
I'm not sure I want to.

17:07.040 --> 17:08.708
I'm... I'm lonely.

17:08.742 --> 17:11.243
What do I have to do to join
this little homoerotic band

17:11.278 --> 17:12.795
of thieves here?

17:12.829 --> 17:14.047
- Okay...
- Someone's looking

17:14.080 --> 17:15.882
for a mouthful of cock and balls, huh?

17:15.915 --> 17:19.335
Well, that does not sound
very appetizing or filling.

17:19.386 --> 17:22.972
Oh, shit! Bruce, Johnny,
over here, quick!

17:23.007 --> 17:25.592
- Kick his ass.
- Leave him alone! Stop!

17:25.626 --> 17:28.394
Fuck you. Fuck you!

17:28.429 --> 17:30.847
Hey, Ted, let's go.

17:32.516 --> 17:34.734
What were you thinking?

17:34.768 --> 17:36.819
I was trying to prevent
you from getting raped

17:36.854 --> 17:38.938
atop a pinball machine,
you ingrate.

17:38.972 --> 17:41.524
They're my regulars. They're
usually sweethearts.

17:41.575 --> 17:43.476
Now you tell me.

17:43.494 --> 17:45.078
Are you okay?

17:45.112 --> 17:47.780
No. I just got my ass kicked
by A.J. crew catalog.

17:47.814 --> 17:48.998
I'm not okay.

17:49.033 --> 17:50.083
What hurts?

17:50.117 --> 17:51.668
My ass.

17:51.702 --> 17:54.420
Yep, this is where the magic happens.

17:54.455 --> 17:57.006
Oops, sorry.
Used to happen.

17:57.041 --> 17:59.092
Yeah, we're splitting the sheets.

17:59.126 --> 18:00.877
D-I-V-O-R-S-E.

18:00.928 --> 18:03.096
Nothing to be ashamed of.
Things just didn't work out.

18:03.130 --> 18:04.797
You know,
could happen to anyone.

18:04.831 --> 18:06.266
Even you guys.

18:06.300 --> 18:10.053
Hey, dickless wonder,
shut up.

18:10.104 --> 18:12.889
Get it together, you two.

18:12.940 --> 18:16.309
Wow, that's disgusting.

18:16.343 --> 18:19.028
Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

18:20.397 --> 18:21.698
Well, that time of the month.

18:21.732 --> 18:24.233
You know how it is, right, sisters?

18:24.285 --> 18:26.035
Aye-yi-yi-yi-yi.

18:26.070 --> 18:28.705
Don't worry,
we'll make it all nice.

18:28.739 --> 18:29.706
Well, I think we've seen everything

18:29.740 --> 18:30.707
we needed to see.

18:30.741 --> 18:32.158
Thank you. Good night.

18:32.192 --> 18:35.628
Really, Marcy,
a fucking tampon in the toilet,

18:35.663 --> 18:37.196
- in this market?
- It's all under control.

18:37.214 --> 18:38.998
You should be ashamed of yourself.

18:39.032 --> 18:42.001
It's going down.

18:50.511 --> 18:51.644
Come on.

18:51.679 --> 18:53.379
- Huh?
- You're coming in.

18:53.397 --> 18:56.265
I want to take a look at you.

18:56.317 --> 18:57.483
What about your friend Balt?

18:57.518 --> 18:59.885
He's sleeping at his boyfriend's.

18:59.903 --> 19:01.387
Oh, he's got a boyfriend?

19:01.405 --> 19:04.941
- Mm-Hmm.
- Good for that dude.

19:06.026 --> 19:08.060
Ow. Ooh, ooh.

19:08.078 --> 19:10.079
Pussy.

19:10.114 --> 19:12.365
What, no points for attempting
to defend your honor,

19:12.399 --> 19:17.754
no matter how ill-conceived
or amateurish the execution?

19:17.788 --> 19:18.755
Mmm... oh.

19:18.789 --> 19:21.007
Is that what you were looking for?

19:21.041 --> 19:22.759
Not exactly,
but that'll do.

19:22.793 --> 19:26.212
Hmm.

19:26.246 --> 19:28.765
No. No mas.
I'm dizzy enough as it is.

19:28.799 --> 19:30.683
And this is not a good idea.

19:30.718 --> 19:32.268
What does that even mean?

19:32.302 --> 19:34.053
You're my student.

19:34.087 --> 19:36.922
Not anymore I'm not.

19:36.940 --> 19:39.859
Well, you're a student,
and I am a teacher,

19:39.893 --> 19:44.397
and as such this is
frowned upon somewhat.

19:44.431 --> 19:47.650
Wow, give me a break.

19:47.701 --> 19:50.787
You once spent an entire
class ranting about

19:50.821 --> 19:52.938
how much you hate Coldplay.

19:52.956 --> 19:54.791
Something tells me that
you could care less

19:54.825 --> 19:56.776
about what's frowned upon.

19:56.794 --> 19:58.494
That's still one of
my favorite lectures.

19:58.545 --> 20:00.246
Mm.

20:00.280 --> 20:03.833
Shit, you're really
weakening my resolve.

20:03.884 --> 20:06.335
Look, I'm 23.

20:06.387 --> 20:10.056
If I'm attracted to you...

20:10.090 --> 20:13.009
if I want to fuck you...

20:13.060 --> 20:18.681
- That's really not helping.
- Then what's the big deal?

20:22.352 --> 20:25.354
You have really nice boobs.

20:25.406 --> 20:27.106
Can I touch one?

20:30.310 --> 20:34.414
Go ahead.

20:41.371 --> 20:43.956
This is so not fair.

20:48.796 --> 20:50.346
Fuck.

20:50.380 --> 20:52.682
It's like a slasher film in there.

20:52.716 --> 20:56.135
I think I got it all.

20:56.169 --> 20:58.304
Are you okay?

20:58.338 --> 21:02.525
Just leave me the fuck
alone, Runkle, Jesus!

21:02.559 --> 21:04.510
Why are you crying?

21:04.528 --> 21:06.529
Why wouldn't I be crying?

21:06.563 --> 21:08.397
I just want to be done with it already.

21:08.449 --> 21:09.866
I want to sell this fucking house

21:09.900 --> 21:11.484
and get on with the rest of my life.

21:11.518 --> 21:13.619
Maybe you should have
thought about that

21:13.654 --> 21:17.039
before you left all that
menstrual blood in the toilet.

21:17.074 --> 21:19.459
Would you cut me some slack?

21:19.493 --> 21:22.245
How many big, stinking dumps
have you left

21:22.296 --> 21:25.998
in that very same toilet?

21:26.032 --> 21:29.385
Uh... I'm sorry I've made
you so unhappy, Marcy.

21:32.005 --> 21:34.557
Doesn't matter anymore.

21:34.591 --> 21:36.375
We just weren't meant to be.

21:36.393 --> 21:37.393
See, that's the thing.

21:37.427 --> 21:38.878
I think we were.

21:38.896 --> 21:41.380
I think we were supposed to
live happily ever after.

21:41.398 --> 21:43.266
I just...
I took a wrong turn somewhere.

21:43.317 --> 21:46.769
Or, okay,
several wrong turns.

21:46.820 --> 21:50.055
I fucked it up.

21:50.073 --> 21:51.607
I'm a big boy, Marcy.

21:51.658 --> 21:54.110
I will do whatever it takes
to make you happy again.

21:54.161 --> 21:55.661
And if that means letting you go,

21:55.696 --> 21:57.363
yhat's what I will do.

21:57.397 --> 21:59.749
Just you watch.

22:10.711 --> 22:11.711
Ow!

22:11.745 --> 22:13.763
What the fuck is wrong with you?

22:13.797 --> 22:16.182
What happened to letting me go?

22:16.216 --> 22:19.302
I don't know. It's hard.

22:23.423 --> 22:25.691
It sure is.

22:25.726 --> 22:28.311
Do that again.

23:27.838 --> 23:29.789
Hey, what's up,
baby blanket?

23:29.823 --> 23:34.660
I can't seem to drag my
ass out of bed this morning.

23:34.678 --> 23:36.262
I don't know.
How 'bout you?

23:36.296 --> 23:38.297
Can't sleep?

23:38.331 --> 23:40.766
No.
That bed's awfully big without you

23:40.801 --> 23:42.802
and your smoking-Hot ass.

23:42.836 --> 23:46.022
That's funny, 'cause
you never seem to have

23:46.056 --> 23:48.975
much of a problem getting
someone to share a bed with you.

23:49.009 --> 23:53.279
Yeah, well,
they ain't you, lady.

23:53.313 --> 23:55.648
So what can I do for you?

23:55.682 --> 23:58.651
That's easy.
You just tell me that despite

23:58.685 --> 24:01.621
all the seemingly shitty things
I do, I'm still a good person.

24:01.655 --> 24:05.574
Oh, my, you are having
a dark night of the soul.

24:05.626 --> 24:09.795
I'm just not liking
myself very much lately,

24:09.830 --> 24:11.831
and we're fresh out of booze.

24:11.865 --> 24:15.668
Otherwise I'd sleeping like
a drunk marmoset right now.

24:15.702 --> 24:18.004
So what, you want me
to hear your confession

24:18.038 --> 24:21.373
and absolve you of all your sins?

24:21.391 --> 24:22.591
That's kind of hard to do
when I don't know

24:22.643 --> 24:24.677
what you're up to out there.

24:24.711 --> 24:26.929
You want me to give you the gory deets?

24:26.980 --> 24:28.264
God, no.

24:28.315 --> 24:31.400
I mean, that's the beauty
of being so far away.

24:31.435 --> 24:34.654
I don't need to listen to
the gory deets anymore.

24:34.688 --> 24:38.491
- But thank you.
- Mm...

24:38.525 --> 24:40.276
You make me feel better.

24:40.327 --> 24:43.996
It's what I do.

24:44.031 --> 24:47.750
Listen, much as I would love
to soul search with you,

24:47.784 --> 24:49.585
I need to go.

24:49.619 --> 24:55.791
I get it. It's time to make
the doughnuts, right?

24:55.842 --> 24:57.126
You still love me?

24:57.177 --> 24:59.879
Always.

24:59.913 --> 25:01.514
That's the problem.

25:01.548 --> 25:04.083
Gospel.

25:04.101 --> 25:05.434
Have a good day.

25:05.469 --> 25:06.969
Get some sleep, sinner.

25:07.020 --> 25:10.089
And give that little rapscallion
a kiss for me, okay?

25:10.107 --> 25:13.693
Will do, bugaboo.

25:21.651 --> 25:24.870
Top of the morning to you,
Miss Robinson.

25:24.905 --> 25:27.123
And you too, Mr. Moody.

25:27.157 --> 25:29.375
And just so you know,
I've been thinking about it,

25:29.409 --> 25:32.078
and I don't think we
can be friends anymore.

25:32.112 --> 25:35.081
- Oh, really? That's too bad.
- Not necessarily.

25:35.115 --> 25:38.334
I'm not wearing any underwear.

25:43.090 --> 25:45.674
Professor, would you mind terribly

25:45.726 --> 25:47.259
if I audit your class this morning?

25:47.293 --> 25:49.311
I was thinking you could probably

25:49.346 --> 25:52.598
teach me a thing or
two about life, love,

25:52.632 --> 25:54.734
the pursuit of happiness.

25:54.768 --> 25:57.987
I'm sorry I'm late, teach.

25:58.021 --> 25:59.438
Hot date.

25:59.472 --> 26:01.774
You know,
up all night thinking about it.

26:01.808 --> 26:05.995
Just keep on replaying it
over and over and over

26:06.029 --> 26:07.747
in my mind.
