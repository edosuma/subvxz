WEBVTT

01:05.500 --> 01:08.416
AND OTHER BRILLIANT ACTORS

01:10.708 --> 01:17.541
This story takes place
during an economic boom in Sweden.

01:17.625 --> 01:19.208
PARVUS
FINANCE

01:25.583 --> 01:30.000
Sorry to bother you. I see you
have more important things to do.

01:30.083 --> 01:32.833
But what are we doing
about this toaster factory?

01:36.208 --> 01:37.708
It's always pulling left.

01:44.250 --> 01:46.250
"Toastmaster."

01:47.250 --> 01:48.958
- Close it down.
- Okay.

01:49.041 --> 01:53.250
- We're only after the land, right?
- Yep. Sure.

02:11.125 --> 02:14.666
The meeting starts in two minutes, fellas.

02:14.750 --> 02:16.125
Okay.

02:18.375 --> 02:23.125
Parvus Finance regrets the closure

02:23.208 --> 02:25.791
and hopes you understand.

02:25.875 --> 02:31.208
My thanks for all these years.

02:31.291 --> 02:32.833
Ms. Wallin?

02:36.541 --> 02:38.791
Let's start here.

02:38.875 --> 02:41.125
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Göte.

02:41.958 --> 02:43.791
Well, that's that.

02:43.875 --> 02:48.875
After twenty years, all you get is
a couple vegetables and, "Goodbye!"

02:48.958 --> 02:50.375
Yeah.

02:50.458 --> 02:52.875
Parvus Finance...

02:52.958 --> 02:55.291
...can kiss my ass!

02:55.958 --> 02:59.666
- Don't you want the stuff?
- You take it, Stickan.

03:08.541 --> 03:11.583
That poor man.
Give him some coins, Rutger.

03:13.333 --> 03:14.666
Here you go.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.958
Don't spend it all on pilsner.

03:21.041 --> 03:24.416
He looked nice and neat, after all.

03:25.250 --> 03:27.625
BRAMSERUD & PARTNERS
Accumulate Create Perform

03:40.416 --> 03:42.875
Hey! Time for a round of golf?

03:42.958 --> 03:47.000
No, I have a lesson with Patric.

03:47.083 --> 03:52.833
I mean, my swing is perfect,
but there are a few details left.

03:52.916 --> 03:55.375
Like hitting the ball
and other little things.

03:57.416 --> 03:58.958
Are you here to play?

03:59.041 --> 04:02.750
No, we have a meeting
about the new nine-hole course.

04:02.833 --> 04:06.791
We'll play a few holes after that,
since we're already here.

04:06.875 --> 04:09.000
How's the building permit coming along?

04:09.083 --> 04:12.041
The County Custodian of Antiquities
is making a fuss.

04:12.125 --> 04:15.250
He wants to classify the place
as an archeological site.

04:15.333 --> 04:18.416
Archeologists are a strange bunch!

04:18.500 --> 04:21.125
Then again, he's not a golfer!

04:27.708 --> 04:30.291
They're at it again.

04:30.375 --> 04:33.541
Go inside, Olle.
Grandma and Grandpa will be right in.

04:33.625 --> 04:36.625
- Ivar. Your helmet.
- Yeah, yeah.

04:45.875 --> 04:48.791
How long are we going to live like this?

04:48.875 --> 04:51.333
We shouldn't have leased the land to them.

04:51.416 --> 04:55.875
That's just how it is, honey.
It pays twice as much as grain.

04:58.333 --> 04:59.250
Pardon me.

05:02.250 --> 05:04.208
Guess I forgot to adjust my thumb.

05:07.875 --> 05:10.875
Oh! Sliced it again.

05:10.958 --> 05:12.625
Move your thumb over a bit more.

05:12.708 --> 05:15.875
You came into the swing from the outside.

05:15.958 --> 05:18.083
Now the tee is too high.

05:24.875 --> 05:27.708
- What's that?
- A tee drill.

05:27.791 --> 05:31.958
- A "tee drill"?
- Yeah. It really works. It's from the US.

05:32.041 --> 05:34.500
You should sell them in the pro shop.

05:37.958 --> 05:41.958
That's so unfair. Ask him to leave.

05:42.041 --> 05:44.166
Tell him his teddy bear kiddy show is on.

05:44.250 --> 05:46.416
Mikael is good.

05:46.500 --> 05:50.166
- Our juniors are really good.
- Is he a member?

05:50.250 --> 05:51.500
Of course!

05:51.583 --> 05:54.750
There's a ten-year waiting list.

05:54.833 --> 05:57.375
And he's, what, seven?

05:57.458 --> 05:59.916
He must have applied when he was a sperm.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.166
His parents registered him
when he was born.

06:03.250 --> 06:05.916
That's the only way to get in these days.

06:07.875 --> 06:10.125
Next, item four.

06:10.208 --> 06:13.708
Should we allow people to play shirtless?

06:13.791 --> 06:16.125
No. It's improper golf etiquette.

06:16.208 --> 06:20.958
No, men shouldn't play shirtless,
unless we can, too.

06:22.791 --> 06:23.833
Sorry.

06:24.500 --> 06:27.583
Then there's today's most important item:

06:28.625 --> 06:31.333
The expansion of the golf course.

06:31.416 --> 06:35.208
To 27 holes.
That is, an additional nine holes.

06:35.291 --> 06:37.958
The County Custodian
of Antiquities said no.

06:38.041 --> 06:41.583
This has caused a bunch of problems.
Everything's been delayed.

06:41.666 --> 06:46.833
We have to appeal. If we win,
we won't get started until the winter,

06:46.916 --> 06:50.083
with all the problems that entails.

06:50.166 --> 06:51.916
Frozen ground and such.

06:52.750 --> 06:57.125
So, let's hear why the state
wants to prevent people

06:57.208 --> 07:00.000
from having fun,
from getting a little exercise.

07:00.083 --> 07:06.625
The area is most likely
an old settlement from the Viking Age.

07:06.708 --> 07:10.083
A lot of ancient artifacts
have been found here over the years.

07:10.166 --> 07:14.125
Oh, really? I've never heard
anything about that. Have you, Torn?

07:14.208 --> 07:15.500
No.

07:15.583 --> 07:19.875
Olofsson, who leases the land to us,
would have said something.

07:19.958 --> 07:24.666
He pointed out, actually,
when we were turned down,

07:24.750 --> 07:28.708
that he's never seen
any evidence of ancient artifacts.

07:28.791 --> 07:30.875
We have different information.

07:31.708 --> 07:37.375
The new course would be in an area
with very sensitive plant and animal life.

07:38.416 --> 07:42.666
Personally, I don't think
artificial lawns and sand traps

07:42.750 --> 07:45.208
have a place
in our Swedish cultural landscape.

07:45.291 --> 07:49.416
Your personal opinion
is totally irrelevant.

07:49.500 --> 07:53.583
Show us your ancient artifacts
instead of spouting your theories.

07:53.666 --> 07:56.541
And as far as the sand traps...

07:56.625 --> 08:00.250
If you want to play in a sandbox,
you can go to Birka.

08:00.333 --> 08:02.583
Well, I never...!

08:10.625 --> 08:14.541
- Well, there went the nine holes.
- Nah.

08:14.625 --> 08:19.333
I think we need to try
a more diplomatic approach.

08:19.416 --> 08:21.166
People like him need to be reined in.

08:21.250 --> 08:22.708
Who's that?

08:24.583 --> 08:26.416
It looks like the Antiquities Custodian.

08:26.500 --> 08:29.708
Quick! Get the tablecloth.
I'll get the other stuff.

09:12.291 --> 09:15.375
Take off your helmet, Ivar.
He'll think we're crazy.

09:18.541 --> 09:22.458
You're right in time for coffee.
Would you like a cup?

09:32.750 --> 09:34.583
- Lovely weather.
- Yes...

09:37.333 --> 09:41.166
I understand you're looking
for your Viking village.

09:41.250 --> 09:42.541
Yeah...

09:43.625 --> 09:45.041
Time is running out.

09:47.375 --> 09:50.083
Have you really not found anything
in all these years?

09:50.166 --> 09:54.333
Old coins, clay shards,
or something similar?

09:55.208 --> 09:56.791
No, it's mostly been stone.

10:07.708 --> 10:10.416
Look, here's my ball!

10:10.500 --> 10:13.250
I thought it went
onto the Olofssons' land.

10:13.333 --> 10:17.791
That's because you insist
on playing without your glasses.

10:17.875 --> 10:20.541
It makes me look ten years younger.

10:20.625 --> 10:23.750
You don't want to play
with an old bat, do you, darling?

10:23.833 --> 10:25.583
Of course not, dear.

10:28.083 --> 10:30.958
If you find anything, report it.

10:31.916 --> 10:34.458
According to the fifth paragraph
of the Antiquities Act,

10:34.541 --> 10:37.583
you're committing a crime if you don't.

10:57.375 --> 11:04.041
I like the tension
between the masculine and the feminine.

11:04.125 --> 11:08.541
They should probably be placed
in a sort of diptych.

11:11.083 --> 11:13.166
What's that one called again?

11:14.208 --> 11:18.166
- That one?
-"Vision of the Future Three."

11:19.166 --> 11:22.000
And that's "Vision of the Future Two"?

11:22.875 --> 11:25.458
No, it's "Night of the Lesbians."

11:29.291 --> 11:30.416
No...

11:31.333 --> 11:34.375
I don't know if the room
can handle the intensity.

11:35.500 --> 11:37.500
- Hi, darling.
- Hi.

11:37.583 --> 11:39.000
Nice!

11:43.333 --> 11:45.333
What the hell are you doing?!

11:47.041 --> 11:48.750
Sorry.

11:49.458 --> 11:52.666
- Can I talk to you?
- Sure.

11:55.083 --> 11:57.708
I'm sorry,
but we can't see each other tonight.

11:57.791 --> 12:00.083
I'm closing down a company.

12:01.708 --> 12:03.500
Well, a toaster factory...

12:03.583 --> 12:07.875
Skip the details. I know Parvus Finance
is more important than me.

12:07.958 --> 12:10.250
We won't have time
to play golf tomorrow, will we?

12:10.333 --> 12:14.083
Sure we will.
I'll try to get away for a few hours.

12:14.166 --> 12:16.791
We have a 10:43 a.m. tee time
with Tom and Pyttan.

12:16.875 --> 12:18.875
- We do, do we?
- Yep.

12:18.958 --> 12:23.916
Isn't it a little strange that we only
see each other on the golf course?

12:25.500 --> 12:30.458
- Now you're being unfair.
- I'm being unfair? Oh, forgive me.

12:30.541 --> 12:36.000
I don't mind being your mistress,
but I refuse to be your "golf buddy."

12:36.083 --> 12:38.750
Excuse me. I have to finish
setting up the exhibition.

12:38.833 --> 12:40.583
Hey, listen...

12:42.333 --> 12:45.291
Will you be there tomorrow at 10:43 a.m.?

12:45.375 --> 12:48.125
I really did try to get out of tonight.

12:48.208 --> 12:52.250
Fine!
I'll be there tomorrow at 10:43 a.m.

12:58.083 --> 13:00.333
- Hi.
- Hi, Stig-Helmer!

13:00.416 --> 13:02.541
- Terrific you could come!
- Yeah.

13:02.625 --> 13:05.708
- Nice to get some exercise.
- It sure is.

13:05.791 --> 13:08.875
You can rent a racket.

13:08.958 --> 13:11.708
- I brought my own.
- You did?

13:11.791 --> 13:13.416
Look.

13:13.500 --> 13:17.875
Oh, my! "Deluxe Badminton Set.
Made in Taiwan."

13:21.208 --> 13:24.541
- Both ball and net!
- Yep.

13:24.625 --> 13:28.333
- Where did you get it?
- The gas station in Norrtull.

13:28.416 --> 13:31.875
It was really cheap. 39 kronor!

13:31.958 --> 13:34.458
But I guess the quality isn't that great.

13:34.541 --> 13:38.125
Stig-Helmer,
sometimes I think you're screwing with me.

13:49.291 --> 13:52.375
Ten minutes. Only fifty minutes to go.

13:56.291 --> 13:59.041
Wearing yourself out like that
can't be healthy.

13:59.125 --> 14:00.333
No.

14:01.125 --> 14:03.791
- Too bad about Toastmaster.
- Yeah.

14:03.875 --> 14:08.333
It was a crap job,
standing there checking toasters all day.

14:08.416 --> 14:13.583
Yeah, but I liked it there.
My co-workers were nice.

14:13.666 --> 14:16.416
- But it didn't pay very well.
- That's what I'm saying.

14:16.500 --> 14:19.000
It was a badly-paid, crap job.

14:19.083 --> 14:24.416
You should thank your lucky stars
you escaped Toastmaster.

14:24.500 --> 14:28.083
Huh? Life is full of possibilities,
Stig-Helmer.

14:28.166 --> 14:29.208
Yeah, maybe.

14:34.541 --> 14:37.583
- Have you ever pumped iron?
- No, never.

14:37.666 --> 14:41.708
- It feels great. Try this one.
- Me?

14:41.791 --> 14:45.083
Put this down. Grab it there and there.

14:45.166 --> 14:46.750
And lift!

14:46.833 --> 14:48.916
Go, Stig-Helmer! Come on!

14:53.541 --> 14:55.208
- Heavy.
- Yeah.

14:56.750 --> 15:00.041
I'm going to an exhibition tonight.
Want to come?

15:00.125 --> 15:03.583
- Sorry, I'm busy.
- New girl?

15:03.666 --> 15:05.750
Not exactly.

15:09.666 --> 15:11.583
'Hi!
'Hi!

15:12.708 --> 15:15.333
- Nice to see you.
- Thanks.

15:15.416 --> 15:18.916
'Hi!
'Hi!

15:19.000 --> 15:21.916
- Great turnout!
- I know, right?

15:22.000 --> 15:25.666
- Congrats.
- Thank you.

15:25.750 --> 15:30.000
- Where's the artist?
- Over there.

15:30.083 --> 15:32.750
- The one with the beard?
- No.

15:32.833 --> 15:37.416
Artists don't have beards these days.
That's the art critic.

15:37.500 --> 15:41.250
The well-dressed man next to him
is the artist.

15:41.333 --> 15:44.416
He doesn't look like he's starving.

15:44.500 --> 15:47.916
He was already famous at the academy.

15:48.500 --> 15:50.583
- Hi.
- Hi! Welcome!

15:51.708 --> 15:53.916
Hello, there!

15:55.583 --> 15:58.208
An open structure.

15:58.291 --> 16:02.333
- You avoid complicated hierarchies.
- Otherwise there's a gap.

16:02.416 --> 16:07.458
I want to transform utopia
into pragmatism.

16:08.666 --> 16:10.208
Interesting.

16:16.541 --> 16:18.041
How much is that?

16:18.125 --> 16:23.125
It appears to transform utopia
into pragmatism.

16:24.125 --> 16:25.666
Oh, that?

16:26.833 --> 16:31.541
- It's been a while.
- Last time was at the golf club, I think.

16:31.625 --> 16:34.416
Yes. How's the golfing going?

16:34.500 --> 16:38.125
I switched to a Mazda.

16:39.250 --> 16:42.000
Seriously.
I don't play as much as I used to.

16:42.083 --> 16:45.166
- It takes up so much time!
- It really does.

16:45.250 --> 16:47.208
What's your handicap these days?

16:47.291 --> 16:51.250
Fat, nearsighted, Norwegian...

16:52.208 --> 16:56.083
I have a 30 handicap, but I never use it.

16:56.166 --> 17:00.000
I should only pay 50% of the annual fee.

17:00.083 --> 17:03.750
- Why's that?
- I'm never on the fairway anyway.

17:04.500 --> 17:10.125
I heard you're dating some golf schmuck.
Is it true?

17:10.208 --> 17:15.375
Well, it's a long story.
We can talk about it some other time.

17:15.458 --> 17:17.250
Over dinner?

17:18.291 --> 17:22.625
- Sure.
- I bought one of those noodle dishes.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.833
- Huh?
- A wok!

17:24.916 --> 17:28.291
Oh! I'd love to.

17:28.375 --> 17:30.583
I need someone to socialize with.

17:30.666 --> 17:35.625
<i>Green 61. Six, one. "Bingo" on 61.</i>

17:35.708 --> 17:38.666
- Don't forget to give it to Karl Helmer.
- I won't, Morn.

17:38.750 --> 17:40.083
<i>You win 100 kronor.</i>

17:40.166 --> 17:42.250
I can't believe they fired you.

17:42.958 --> 17:47.458
You've worked yourself to death for them
since you left secondary school.

17:47.541 --> 17:50.125
- And you got nothing for it.
- I got...

17:50.208 --> 17:53.291
At least your father got a gold watch.

17:53.375 --> 17:57.666
- It may have been gold plated, but still.
- I got a toaster.

17:57.750 --> 18:01.291
- A toaster!
- It was an F41. The deluxe model.

18:01.375 --> 18:04.416
Four slices. It was very expensive.

18:04.500 --> 18:09.791
You didn't get your engineering degree.
What will become of you?

18:09.875 --> 18:12.750
Go Bajen!

18:14.041 --> 18:16.625
Fifty and unemployed.

18:16.708 --> 18:21.125
- We were promised other jobs.
- Doing what?

18:21.208 --> 18:23.583
Something to do with the environment.

18:26.000 --> 18:30.041
You're squishing his paw!
His paw is caught!

18:34.791 --> 18:37.250
Just get a regular car.

18:37.333 --> 18:40.500
It's so embarrassing
getting into this mish-mash...

18:40.583 --> 18:43.791
- Messerschmitt, Mom.
- That's what I said.

18:54.750 --> 18:56.958
I tried to stay calm and collected.

18:57.666 --> 19:02.625
But then that uppity chairman said
I could go dig at Birka.

19:04.458 --> 19:09.416
I try not to have
preconceived notions about golfers.

19:09.500 --> 19:12.750
Are you sure
the settlement is in that area?

19:12.833 --> 19:15.041
Everything points to it.

19:15.750 --> 19:18.583
I'm worried
they'll destroy the entire area.

19:18.666 --> 19:22.083
Golfers ruined the Viking port in Gotland.

19:24.125 --> 19:29.000
If we join the EEC,
Sweden will be one big golf course.

19:30.333 --> 19:32.541
Poor baby.

19:32.625 --> 19:33.750
Huh?

19:33.833 --> 19:37.083
Were those bad old golfers mean to you?

19:37.166 --> 19:41.708
Lay down and dream
that Sweden is one big excavation site.

19:42.708 --> 19:44.666
The helmet, darling.

19:51.750 --> 19:56.000
"Environmental care." What bullshit!

19:56.083 --> 20:00.375
Nope. Street sweepers, that's what we are.

20:02.166 --> 20:06.708
Although we're probably called
"sidewalk therapists,"

20:06.791 --> 20:11.458
or "trash cosmetologists" these days!

20:13.208 --> 20:17.375
At least we're out in the fresh air.
That's nice.

20:17.458 --> 20:22.916
Don't be so damned positive, Stickan!
Remember, you're Swedish!

20:24.208 --> 20:26.666
God, how people litter!

20:26.750 --> 20:28.541
Environmental Management Inc.

20:36.166 --> 20:37.541
Hey!

20:39.500 --> 20:41.916
I didn't recognize you
without your golf clubs.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.291
Cute, darling. Cute.

20:44.375 --> 20:47.166
- Where are my golf clubs?
- In the garage.

20:47.250 --> 20:50.375
Or you could do some gardening.

20:50.458 --> 20:54.625
Hit some dandelions with the sandwich,
or whatever it's called.

20:54.708 --> 20:57.291
No time. I have a 10:43 tee time.

20:57.375 --> 20:59.333
When you're done with those 18 holes,

20:59.416 --> 21:03.625
maybe you could fix the ones
in the fence and the roof.

21:30.916 --> 21:34.125
Then the fox said, "I'll eat you up!"

21:37.500 --> 21:41.958
How many times
have I told you those aren't toys?

21:43.666 --> 21:46.791
You have your "Ninja Turtles"
or whatever they're called.

21:46.875 --> 21:49.958
- Are you playing golf again?
- No.

21:50.041 --> 21:54.958
- I'm going fishing. What did you think?
- All you do is play golf.

21:59.500 --> 22:03.250
Welcome to Guldbrandsen Gallery's
answering machine.

22:03.333 --> 22:05.000
I'm in meetings all day.

22:05.083 --> 22:09.000
Leave a message after the beep.
Have a nice day.

22:28.333 --> 22:31.708
GULDBRANDSEN GALLERY

22:31.791 --> 22:34.416
COSMIC CADENCE

22:42.958 --> 22:44.916
10,000 dollars?

23:01.166 --> 23:03.333
CLEAT CAFETERIA

23:04.125 --> 23:09.125
The delivery entrance is in the back.
This entrance is for members only!

23:10.083 --> 23:13.166
Bruno, it's okay. He's here to see me.

23:18.541 --> 23:20.625
Who was that?

23:20.708 --> 23:22.708
I didn't think
people like him existed anymore!

23:22.791 --> 23:26.416
He's the club's new chairman,
Bruno Anderhage.

23:26.500 --> 23:28.833
Parvus Finance.

23:29.791 --> 23:32.875
- Hey, that's great!
- Thanks.

23:33.875 --> 23:37.416
- I know exactly where to put them. Thanks!
- Bye!

23:41.625 --> 23:43.291
'Hi!
'Hi!

23:46.416 --> 23:48.250
- Hi!
- Hello!

23:48.333 --> 23:51.583
We don't see each other for a year,
now we see each other every day!

23:51.666 --> 23:53.541
- Are you going to play?
- No...

23:53.625 --> 23:57.333
You can't waste
such a beautiful day playing golf!

23:58.333 --> 23:59.791
Listen...

23:59.875 --> 24:03.291
What do you say to wok night tonight?

24:03.375 --> 24:05.208
- Tonight?
- Yeah.

24:05.291 --> 24:08.208
What time did you have in mind?

24:08.291 --> 24:13.000
- Double bogey on nine?
- Double bogey...?

24:13.083 --> 24:15.291
- Seven o'clock?
- Yeah.

24:15.375 --> 24:18.875
That's fine. I have to go.
We have a 10:43 tee time.

24:18.958 --> 24:19.791
- Okay
- Bye!

24:27.375 --> 24:28.416
'Hi!

24:28.500 --> 24:29.708
Hi!

24:30.500 --> 24:31.916
- Hi.
- Hi.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.875
I'll show you a real whopper!

24:36.000 --> 24:38.083
What the hell is this?

24:39.541 --> 24:41.708
People will wear anything!

24:44.458 --> 24:45.750
Hi.

24:47.041 --> 24:52.291
I'm club chairman.
Please dress appropriately in the future.

24:52.375 --> 24:56.541
This isn't a campground,
it's a golf course.

24:57.583 --> 24:58.916
Asshole.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.083
Parvus Finance, Anderhage.

25:01.791 --> 25:03.375
Hello!

25:03.458 --> 25:06.916
Yes... Yes... Okay.

25:08.708 --> 25:14.083
Rune's Excavation is faxing over
the estimate for the new holes.

25:17.916 --> 25:21.958
- One moment. I'll put my lawyer on.
- Yes, hello.

25:22.041 --> 25:25.041
I don't know why they bother
having an office.

25:25.750 --> 25:28.833
Where else would they put in the winter?

25:40.291 --> 25:42.041
Pyttan !

25:42.708 --> 25:43.833
Oops.

25:51.875 --> 25:54.791
Tough luck, Bruno. It was a good shot.

25:54.875 --> 25:58.625
I thought I'd shoot
20 meters further with this.

25:58.708 --> 26:00.208
And you did.

26:00.291 --> 26:04.000
The ball went 20 meters further
into the forest than usual.

26:10.541 --> 26:13.125
DO YOU OFTEN WIND UP HERE?
THEN IT'S TIME FOR A LESSON!

26:13.208 --> 26:14.625
TALK TO PATRIK IN THE PRO SHOP.

26:14.708 --> 26:17.750
What kind of nonsense is this?

26:45.375 --> 26:48.083
Stickan!

26:48.166 --> 26:51.916
Don't dawdle.
We have another district to do today.

26:57.166 --> 26:59.458
- Fore!
- Watch out!

27:00.458 --> 27:01.708
"Watch out"?

27:01.791 --> 27:05.750
You've been playing golf for 50 years,
and you yell "Watch out"?

27:05.833 --> 27:09.625
It's "fore"!
Or are you so senile you've forgotten?

27:23.750 --> 27:26.125
What do those chickens look like?

27:27.166 --> 27:31.083
How much are you making
on that Toastmaster deal?

27:31.166 --> 27:35.041
-20-25 million?
- Something like that.

27:35.125 --> 27:39.208
So, he should be able
to afford his own tees.

27:39.833 --> 27:43.791
But I guess they've gone up to 20 öre.
20 öre here, 20 öre there...

27:43.875 --> 27:47.041
Not a single goddamn tee.

27:47.125 --> 27:49.791
The people in front of us
are a bunch of cheapskates.

27:49.875 --> 27:54.208
- Mette, do you have a tee?
- Yes, of course.

27:54.291 --> 27:57.833
What color do you want?
Something to match your pants?

27:57.916 --> 27:59.875
- Stop fooling around.
- Catch.

28:08.625 --> 28:12.041
What do you say?
1,000 kronor closest to the hole?

28:12.916 --> 28:14.500
Deal.

28:27.166 --> 28:29.041
What the hell are they doing?

28:30.250 --> 28:35.333
You always have amateurs in front of you,
and Ballesteros behind you.

28:46.791 --> 28:48.166
Damn!

28:48.250 --> 28:51.875
And he's supposed to be club chairman!

29:08.875 --> 29:12.166
What kind of club is that?
It looks like a vacuum cleaner.

29:13.333 --> 29:15.875
Damn, what a strange game!

29:30.333 --> 29:32.208
Oops! Sorry.

29:42.333 --> 29:43.375
Too bad, Bruno.

29:45.333 --> 29:47.833
That damned bunker!

29:47.916 --> 29:52.250
It's hard to concentrate
when people won't be quiet.

29:53.875 --> 29:56.958
- What are you doing?
- I had a hundred kronor on the bunker.

29:57.041 --> 29:59.875
Pyttan had a hundred on the rough. Ta-da!

29:59.958 --> 30:02.208
A hundred kronor?

30:02.291 --> 30:03.333
Amateurs!

30:25.208 --> 30:27.416
Fucking clubs!

30:27.500 --> 30:30.958
You forfeit a stroke if you throw a club.

30:31.041 --> 30:33.541
I think you should shut your mouth, Mette.

30:43.958 --> 30:46.458
My ex-husband, Åke, was a golfer.

30:46.541 --> 30:52.291
Finally, I said to him,
"You have to choose between me and golf!"

30:52.375 --> 30:54.625
He chose golf.

31:02.916 --> 31:05.583
This one's into gardening,
so at least I see him.

31:05.666 --> 31:10.833
I wish Bruno would help out in the yard
instead of playing stupid golf.

31:10.916 --> 31:12.875
He says he hates gardening.

31:17.250 --> 31:20.166
How many strokes so far, Bruno?

31:20.250 --> 31:22.833
None of your business.
You count yours, I'll count mine.

31:22.916 --> 31:25.208
When we played last week...

31:25.291 --> 31:28.666
- Don't people have jobs?
- No.

31:28.750 --> 31:34.208
They sold their house in Benidorm,
and now they're moving to Florida.

31:34.291 --> 31:37.375
They're tired of Spain and the tourists.

31:37.458 --> 31:40.916
Shh, Alice. Rutger's putting for a birdie.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.125
Wait until I'm finished, darling.

31:43.208 --> 31:48.083
You know how annoyed you get
when I talk while you're putting.

31:48.166 --> 31:52.916
And they bought a plot near Orlando,

31:53.000 --> 31:55.875
and they just love it there.

31:56.916 --> 31:59.875
I'm done talking, Rutger darling.

32:06.875 --> 32:09.250
I can't concentrate when she's quiet.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.333
Here, Stickan. Here.

32:21.750 --> 32:23.458
- Sink it.
- What?

32:23.541 --> 32:25.208
Sink it.

32:25.291 --> 32:26.750
Okay...

32:31.500 --> 32:35.416
Shut your trap, Alice!
Stig-Helmer is putting for a birdie!

32:38.083 --> 32:40.250
Yeah!

32:40.333 --> 32:42.041
What kind of nonsense is this?

32:44.791 --> 32:46.958
Good, Bruno! It's going in!

32:47.041 --> 32:48.791
No!

32:55.000 --> 32:56.875
That one's on me.

32:58.708 --> 32:59.541
Thanks.

33:01.958 --> 33:05.041
Hey! Where's the clubhouse?

33:05.125 --> 33:10.416
It's a five iron,
then a dogleg right, and a nine iron.

33:10.500 --> 33:14.250
Maybe you don't play golf.
It's behind the grove over there.

33:14.333 --> 33:15.500
Oh!

33:15.583 --> 33:18.833
Short hole is 3,000.

33:18.916 --> 33:21.916
Closest to the flag on the 16th is 6,000...

33:22.000 --> 33:24.666
Double or nothing on the 18th.

33:24.750 --> 33:26.666
That'll be 12,000, please.

33:29.458 --> 33:31.291
Didn't go too well, did it?

33:31.375 --> 33:34.541
No, it's these new clubs.
I'm going to switch.

33:34.625 --> 33:38.750
I got 32 points, and you got 12.

33:38.833 --> 33:43.291
It's not hard to get 32 points
when you play using ladies' rules.

33:43.375 --> 33:47.583
- I was just unlucky.
- Then you must be very unlucky.

33:47.666 --> 33:51.333
You got 12 points on Tuesday.
With your old clubs.

33:51.416 --> 33:54.833
It was all that goddamn cackling.
I'm just a bit off kilter.

33:54.916 --> 33:57.958
It's hard to concentrate
with all that cackling.

33:58.041 --> 34:01.166
Cackling? Now you listen to me,
Bruno Anderhage!

34:01.250 --> 34:04.333
The little golf you've learned in 15 years

34:04.416 --> 34:08.791
is what a normal person learns in a week,
so don't tell me you're "unlucky."

34:08.875 --> 34:10.916
Bullshit!

34:12.208 --> 34:17.791
So you think anyone could beat me at golf
after one week?

34:17.875 --> 34:19.833
After one day, if you play like today.

34:19.916 --> 34:22.208
So you're saying, for example...

34:25.291 --> 34:30.750
...that guy could kick my ass at golf
after one week?

34:30.833 --> 34:32.916
That's what I'm saying.

34:33.541 --> 34:36.958
That's the dumbest thing I ever heard.
How much do you want to bet?

34:37.041 --> 34:40.083
- Whatever you want.
- A million?

34:40.166 --> 34:43.208
- Sure!
- And where will you get the money?

34:45.541 --> 34:48.333
I can sell my large Picasso.

34:48.416 --> 34:52.166
There's no risk.
You should consider it, Bruno.

34:53.583 --> 34:55.916
You two are my witnesses.

34:56.958 --> 34:58.291
One million. Deal!

34:58.750 --> 35:01.583
- Hey, you. You in the orange.
- Huh?

35:01.666 --> 35:05.333
- No, the skinny one. Come here a sec.
- Me?

35:14.791 --> 35:16.750
Do YOU play golf?

35:17.625 --> 35:20.875
- No.
- Have you ever played golf?

35:20.958 --> 35:22.708
No, never.

35:23.416 --> 35:26.500
We have a little proposition.

35:26.583 --> 35:29.666
You get one week to learn golf,
then you and I play a match.

35:29.750 --> 35:33.875
You get 100 if you do it.
Here's my card.

35:33.958 --> 35:38.583
-100 kronor? That's not much.
- No. 100,000.

35:38.666 --> 35:40.541
100,000?!

35:41.416 --> 35:42.750
Is this "Candid Camera"?

35:42.833 --> 35:47.416
-"Anderhage."
- Parvus Finance? Where did I hear that?

35:47.500 --> 35:51.333
- Do you think I should do it?
- Yeah, why not?

35:51.416 --> 35:55.541
100,000 kronor for a week's work.
Not too shabby.

35:55.625 --> 35:57.875
I'd have said yes at once.

35:57.958 --> 36:02.125
Your Norwegian buddy plays golf.
He can help you.

36:04.208 --> 36:07.208
<i>Life is full of possibilities,
Stig-Helmer...</i>

36:08.750 --> 36:14.416
The match is on July 26th.
That's in one week.

36:14.500 --> 36:20.166
We hope you'll do it.
We need a knowledgeable judge.

36:21.416 --> 36:24.291
May I ask if there's money involved?

36:24.375 --> 36:29.750
As you know,
club policy doesn't permit betting.

36:29.833 --> 36:33.958
- As chairman, you should know that.
- No, this is a matter of honor.

37:09.333 --> 37:12.958
<i>It's the Swedish Championships.
Terribly exciting.</i>

37:13.041 --> 37:16.583
<i>Stig-Helmer Olsson
leads Ove Sellberg by one stroke.</i>

37:20.250 --> 37:22.250
<i>Sellberg's put goes in!</i>

37:22.333 --> 37:24.750
Do you want the lid on?

37:24.833 --> 37:26.125
No, you can take it off.

37:27.708 --> 37:31.583
<i>Olsson has to sink his put
for the victory.</i>

37:31.666 --> 37:34.583
<i>Olsson wins the Swedish Championship!</i>

37:34.666 --> 37:36.458
- Hi, Mom, it's me.
<i>- Hi.</i>

37:36.541 --> 37:40.166
Do you still have
Uncle Julie's golf stuff?

37:40.250 --> 37:43.750
Yes. It's probably in the attic somewhere.

37:43.833 --> 37:45.708
What do you want it for?

37:45.791 --> 37:48.958
- Are you going to a costume party?
- No!

37:49.041 --> 37:51.041
<i>Poor Julius!</i>

37:51.125 --> 37:57.125
Just because he moved up in society
he thought he had to play golf and bridge...

37:57.208 --> 38:01.583
- But she was the one with the money.
- I'm coming over to borrow the stuff.

38:01.666 --> 38:06.916
Must you really root around in the attic?
I have a dentist appointment.

38:07.000 --> 38:10.791
- Not until next Thursday.
- No, but still.

38:14.083 --> 38:17.541
Look! Here's something tartan.

38:18.250 --> 38:22.916
- That's my old Dixie vest.
- Oh, right.

38:26.500 --> 38:27.916
Well...

38:35.875 --> 38:38.291
Stig-Helmer, look!

38:38.375 --> 38:41.333
Those are Uncle Julie's golf clothes.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.208
Here's his golf bag.

38:47.291 --> 38:49.166
Where are all the clubs?

38:52.250 --> 38:55.833
Oh, dear me!

39:03.500 --> 39:05.375
Oh, I know!

39:17.166 --> 39:19.208
Look!

39:19.291 --> 39:21.083
Morn!

39:32.166 --> 39:34.000
Oh! Yeah!

39:40.625 --> 39:42.875
They worked so well...

39:42.958 --> 39:49.250
I was mad, so I bet him anyone
could beat him at golf after one week.

39:51.166 --> 39:55.041
- How much did you bet?
- A million.

39:56.958 --> 39:59.750
Funny. How much did you really bet?

39:59.833 --> 40:06.166
It's true. A million kronor.
That means nothing to Bruno.

40:06.250 --> 40:10.000
He's become reckless
after all his business deals.

40:10.083 --> 40:14.791
He and Tom are always betting.

40:14.875 --> 40:19.250
Unfortunately for me,
Bruno picked some random guy.

40:19.333 --> 40:22.541
Some scrawny sanitation worker.

40:23.666 --> 40:25.750
- Did you say Bruno?
- Mm-hmm.

40:25.833 --> 40:29.333
Small, dark, new club chairman?

40:29.416 --> 40:31.791
Yeah. Do you know him?

40:31.875 --> 40:36.208
We met once, at the door to the club.

40:36.291 --> 40:38.041
Surely he's not your type.

40:38.125 --> 40:42.666
No. He's not my type,
but I always fall for the wrong type.

40:43.791 --> 40:47.958
Do you think it's possible
to learn to play golf in a week?

40:48.041 --> 40:50.250
I'm so childish!

40:50.333 --> 40:56.458
- What did the sanitation worker say?
- He thought we were crazy.

40:56.541 --> 40:59.250
We said we'd pay him 100,000 kronor.

40:59.333 --> 41:02.208
- Bruno can pay.
- And what if Bruno wins?

41:02.833 --> 41:05.458
Oh, my God! If Bruno wins...

41:06.500 --> 41:10.583
He'll be utterly unbearable.

41:11.291 --> 41:14.333
And I'll be utterly broke.

41:14.416 --> 41:17.000
I have to put a stop to it.
Can I borrow your phone?

41:17.083 --> 41:20.250
Dad? It's for you.

41:22.708 --> 41:23.958
Thanks.

41:25.666 --> 41:28.583
- Anderhage.
- Hi, it's Mette.

41:29.166 --> 41:32.083
It's inappropriate to call me at home.

41:32.166 --> 41:37.541
I know, but I need to talk to you.
I'm sorry for my outburst.

41:37.625 --> 41:40.541
- Let's just forget it.
- No,no.

41:41.541 --> 41:43.833
A deal's a deal, little lady.

41:44.375 --> 41:47.708
If you need something,
we can meet at the driving range.

41:47.791 --> 41:50.666
I need to practice.
Bye. Thanks for calling.

41:50.750 --> 41:52.291
Shit!

41:53.250 --> 41:57.208
- Playing golf again?
- What? No.

41:57.291 --> 42:00.791
- That was my mistress.
- Ha!

42:00.875 --> 42:02.541
You and your damn golf!

42:04.708 --> 42:07.583
Hi! Is this a bad time?

42:07.666 --> 42:10.750
Not at all. Come in, Stig-Helmer.

42:11.583 --> 42:14.166
- Thanks.
- How's the new job?

42:14.250 --> 42:17.750
- Refreshing and good.
- Great.

42:17.833 --> 42:19.750
I'm thinking of taking a leave of absence.

42:19.833 --> 42:21.875
- After only one day?
- Yeah...

42:21.958 --> 42:26.875
This may sound a little strange,
but I thought I'd learn to play golf.

42:27.583 --> 42:30.416
Golf? You're going to learn to play golf?

42:30.500 --> 42:33.916
- Is it hard?
- No. It's super easy.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.833
Just hit far and straight
and into a little hole.

42:36.916 --> 42:41.708
Great. Maybe you can teach me.
I brought some stuff.

42:47.791 --> 42:49.875
Old clubs...

42:50.625 --> 42:52.458
Stig-Helmer, look at me.

42:52.541 --> 42:54.750
- Do you feel okay?
- Sure.

42:54.833 --> 42:58.666
- You look weird. Are you drunk?
- No.

42:58.750 --> 43:00.958
Breathe on me.

43:01.041 --> 43:04.333
I know you're down
after this business with Toastmaster.

43:04.416 --> 43:09.000
Ole? Now it's war! I just don't get...

43:10.666 --> 43:13.875
- That's him!
- But"

43:13.958 --> 43:15.291
Him?

43:39.666 --> 43:44.916
No, Stig-Helmer!
I'll teach you how to eat Chinese.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.500
- Hold the chopsticks like this.
- Okay.

43:47.583 --> 43:49.791
Bang them together, and then...

43:53.125 --> 43:54.166
Voilà!

43:55.291 --> 43:58.166
If wood is too hard, go with iron.

44:00.916 --> 44:05.166
- Well, like I said, Stig... Helmer?
- Helmer.

44:05.250 --> 44:09.916
You'd be doing me a huge favor
if you put Bruno Anderhage,

44:10.000 --> 44:14.791
formerly known as Andersson...
If you put him in his place.

44:14.875 --> 44:18.625
- Maybe you've changed your mind.
- No. Stig-Helmer hasn't changed his mind.

44:18.708 --> 44:22.166
Have you, Stig-Helmer? I'll coach you.

44:22.250 --> 44:28.083
That's very kind of you, Ole,
but I think we need a pro.

44:28.875 --> 44:35.375
Fine. But first Stig-Helmer
needs proper equipment.

44:35.458 --> 44:38.708
Who has the best selection?

44:40.041 --> 44:42.875
Swing-o-Tech. Scratch Company.

44:42.958 --> 44:48.000
- My clubs will be fine.
- Clubs? Those aren't clubs.

44:48.083 --> 44:51.250
They're ancient artifacts!

44:52.291 --> 44:57.583
Okay. We'll meet outside
Swing-o-Tech tomorrow. Noon okay?

44:58.791 --> 45:02.458
- Want me to pick you up?
- No, I'll take the company car.

45:19.625 --> 45:22.291
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT INC.

45:31.583 --> 45:33.458
PUSH FOR TICKET

45:37.875 --> 45:39.375
TICKET

45:43.833 --> 45:46.166
Swing-o-Tech

45:48.208 --> 45:50.750
We'll start with clubs...

45:51.458 --> 45:57.500
The beginner here wants a set
of extremely easy-to-use clubs.

45:58.541 --> 46:01.666
He's going out
as a scratch player next Thursday.

46:01.750 --> 46:07.333
Oh! Then I suggest a cavity back,
with a fairly low center of gravity.

46:07.416 --> 46:10.666
Great. Of course. My thoughts exactly.

46:10.750 --> 46:12.583
Go for it!

46:12.666 --> 46:14.000
Whoops!

46:22.208 --> 46:23.958
- Great, Stig-Helmer!
- This is fun!

46:34.375 --> 46:36.291
<i>Si?</i>

46:50.833 --> 46:54.166
That was Jack Nicklaus.
Final nail in the coffin.

46:54.958 --> 46:59.833
I'll take Stig-Helmer to hit a couple
of buckets at "Bramserud's golf school."

46:59.916 --> 47:01.375
Do so.

47:02.083 --> 47:05.291
God, I hate Bruno Anderhage!

47:05.375 --> 47:07.791
He brings out the worst in me.

47:07.875 --> 47:10.500
Hit a couple of "buckets"?

47:10.583 --> 47:12.416
Yeah. Hit a couple of buckets.

47:14.583 --> 47:15.791
Buckets...?

47:37.333 --> 47:39.500
Hop in.

47:39.583 --> 47:42.208
Sit down. I'm in a fucking hurry.

47:51.625 --> 47:56.166
Hi, it's Anderhage. Tell Patric
I'll be a little late for my lesson.

48:18.333 --> 48:19.166
Damn it!

48:34.708 --> 48:38.000
He's one to talk about proper attire!

48:43.416 --> 48:46.541
You came into the swing
from the outside again.

48:46.625 --> 48:50.041
That slice could cost me a million.

48:51.250 --> 48:53.875
It won't take that many lessons.

48:53.958 --> 48:56.583
What? Oh, right.

48:59.666 --> 49:01.750
Quiet, Fifi!

49:02.458 --> 49:04.291
Carina thinks I'm out with the dog.

49:04.375 --> 49:08.208
The hardest part of this sport
is getting past the wife!

49:19.958 --> 49:23.458
When I play bandy,
I play from this direction.

49:29.458 --> 49:31.500
You brought Uncle Julie's clubs.

49:31.583 --> 49:34.958
- Yeah, as a sort of mascot.
- Okay.

49:38.208 --> 49:42.791
Squeeze there with your hand,
and put your thumb there...

49:43.916 --> 49:46.208
There. Now try and hit it!

50:02.500 --> 50:06.125
- Well, now...
- I guess my hands are too sweaty.

50:06.208 --> 50:08.375
Parvus Finance

50:08.458 --> 50:12.291
- I hit a bucket at lunch. Know who I saw?
- No.

50:12.375 --> 50:15.875
- Your opponent.
- The street sweeper?

50:15.958 --> 50:20.250
- How is he?
- He has a natural, powerful swing.

50:20.333 --> 50:23.541
- He does?
- But he didn't hit the ball.

50:23.625 --> 50:26.583
But he managed
to throw the club 5 meters.

50:26.666 --> 50:29.708
And, I must say, it flew straight.

50:32.375 --> 50:34.125
Yeah...

50:34.208 --> 50:38.250
It'll be like taking candy from a baby.

50:44.291 --> 50:46.416
Damn it! It pulls to the left.

50:51.916 --> 50:56.250
"Hands at the top of the back swing."

51:06.541 --> 51:10.333
- Good morning, Helmer!
- Hi! Come in!

51:11.541 --> 51:13.500
Snazzy look, Stig-Helmer!

51:13.583 --> 51:17.041
Are those the one-and-only
Uncle Julie's clothes?

51:17.125 --> 51:18.791
Yeah.

51:18.875 --> 51:21.541
The socks are a little short...

51:21.625 --> 51:26.083
- Was he any good at golf?
- No. He had a two...

51:26.166 --> 51:29.041
- Handicap? A two?
- Yep...

51:30.208 --> 51:33.666
- We brought some golf books.
- Thanks.

51:37.791 --> 51:43.333
Yes! <i>Golf Without Tears!</i>
Roderic <i>McDougall.</i>

51:43.416 --> 51:46.916
- Where did you get this?
- It was in Uncle Julie's bag.

51:47.000 --> 51:52.416
It was the number-one golf bible
in the '60s.

51:52.500 --> 51:57.750
Roderic "Dogleg" McDougall.
I wonder what he's up to these days?

52:31.041 --> 52:33.750
Stig-Helmer? This is our stop.

52:42.875 --> 52:45.541
His father drove the Flying Scotsman.

52:45.625 --> 52:48.125
- What?
- The Flying Scotsman.

52:48.208 --> 52:50.625
- I see.
- It's a famous locomotive.

52:50.708 --> 52:53.458
I'm going to buy a model of it
when I have the money.

52:53.541 --> 52:54.375
Great!

53:11.000 --> 53:12.541
How strange!

53:13.250 --> 53:17.125
- We were supposed to be picked up.
- Okay...

53:18.250 --> 53:21.166
Maybe they didn't get our message.

53:23.500 --> 53:26.333
- I'll go call.
- Okay.

55:01.750 --> 55:08.000
Fourteen McDougalls in the phone book,
and you're picking up chicks.

55:08.083 --> 55:09.041
This is...

57:29.000 --> 57:31.291
- Nice little village.
- Yeah.

57:31.375 --> 57:35.708
- And nice little lady, too. Fiona.
- Yeah...

57:37.166 --> 57:41.333
The father seems a bit strange.
I wonder what he's up to.

57:41.416 --> 57:43.791
I wouldn't worry.

57:43.875 --> 57:48.458
People are slightly eccentric here.
If you're eccentric here, you're original.

57:48.541 --> 57:52.541
It's not like it is in Sweden,
where you're just an idiot.

57:53.375 --> 57:55.708
You'd fit in well here, Stig-Helmer.

57:55.791 --> 58:00.291
- I'm not all that original.
- No, you're completely average.

58:00.375 --> 58:03.416
Everyone plays with trains
and drives a Messerschmitt

58:03.500 --> 58:06.375
while wearing their uncle's golf pants.

58:26.833 --> 58:31.583
- What do you want?
- A glass of milk, I think.

58:31.666 --> 58:36.958
Milk? Stig-Helmer! This is a pub!
They don't have milk here.

59:47.458 --> 59:48.916
<i>Slainte.</i>

1:00:25.041 --> 1:00:28.791
- Stig-Helmer Olsson.
- Ole Bramserud. Hi there.

1:00:40.166 --> 1:00:42.125
- Did you see that?
- Yep.

1:00:42.208 --> 1:00:44.208
Where the hell did it go?

1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:46.416
Here.

1:01:24.208 --> 1:01:27.333
What the hell are you doing?

1:01:27.416 --> 1:01:29.708
Picking up my ball?

1:01:29.791 --> 1:01:32.791
You're dangerous. You almost hit a deer.

1:01:32.875 --> 1:01:35.291
I don't give a shit about your deer!

1:01:35.375 --> 1:01:38.583
This is a golf course.
Don't pick up the balls!

1:01:38.666 --> 1:01:43.000
This is a forest.
The Right of Public Access applies here.

1:01:43.083 --> 1:01:46.166
The golf course is that way,
and it's covered with grass.

1:01:46.250 --> 1:01:49.083
That's none of your fucking concern.

1:01:49.166 --> 1:01:53.125
Stick to your Viking graves.
Give me my ball before something happens.

1:01:53.208 --> 1:01:55.125
Sure...

1:01:55.208 --> 1:01:59.833
Bovista.Puffball.
Good edible mushroom.

1:02:00.666 --> 1:02:03.458
Your ball is in the bushes over there.

1:02:03.541 --> 1:02:05.291
Happy hunting!

1:06:33.916 --> 1:06:34.750
Ole?

1:06:37.833 --> 1:06:39.625
Ole?

1:06:40.583 --> 1:06:43.250
- Hi.
- Hi.

1:06:43.333 --> 1:06:45.416
Do you hear that?

1:06:47.125 --> 1:06:50.958
Yeah.
Sounds like an iron pipe or something.

1:06:54.708 --> 1:06:58.000
You're too old
to believe in the plumber, Stig-Helmer.

1:06:58.083 --> 1:07:01.416
- Yeah...
- Go back to bed. Nighty-night.

1:07:02.833 --> 1:07:04.916
Good night.

1:07:20.708 --> 1:07:22.416
Fiona...

1:10:15.125 --> 1:10:19.000
- Nice to get some exercise, isn't it?
- Yeah.

1:10:35.875 --> 1:10:39.125
- Tired?
- A little.

1:10:39.208 --> 1:10:41.875
Now we just have to go back!

1:11:01.875 --> 1:11:03.583
Jesus!

1:11:17.916 --> 1:11:20.750
Think I'll make it with a three?

1:11:20.833 --> 1:11:24.333
- I would play it safe.
-"Safe"?

1:11:26.750 --> 1:11:29.208
- Can I give you a tip?
- What?

1:11:29.291 --> 1:11:33.750
- Hit farther and straighter?
- Play by ladies' rules.

1:11:35.666 --> 1:11:38.083
- Ladies' rules?
- Don't be so macho.

1:11:38.166 --> 1:11:42.375
Use the clubs you can handle.
Skip the woods.

1:11:42.458 --> 1:11:45.916
Oh, no.
There will be no ladies' rules here.

1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:49.166
It was just a suggestion. It's your money.

1:11:54.083 --> 1:11:56.166
What the hell was that?

1:12:08.125 --> 1:12:10.125
Here it is.

1:12:13.583 --> 1:12:16.000
What the hell...?

1:12:23.541 --> 1:12:26.083
I hit a rabbit.

1:12:37.500 --> 1:12:39.416
Black grouse.

1:12:52.416 --> 1:12:56.541
A rock ptarmigan down here?
Someone's screwing with us.

1:13:00.208 --> 1:13:04.000
I've had it with that Viking idiot.

1:13:04.083 --> 1:13:06.750
I'm giving the go-ahead
for the new holes today.

1:13:06.833 --> 1:13:12.500
- And who pays if we're turned down?
- I do.

1:14:52.791 --> 1:14:54.833
Amazing! Where did you learn to do that?

1:14:54.916 --> 1:14:59.041
I kicked the ball around as a kid.
All the little boys did.

1:14:59.125 --> 1:15:01.291
Golf seems trickier.

1:15:01.375 --> 1:15:04.625
WE'RE BUILDING VITTRINGE'S
NEW 9-HOLE GOLF COURSE

1:15:23.375 --> 1:15:27.750
Line it up properly
and caress the ball away.

1:15:27.833 --> 1:15:29.000
Okay.

1:15:34.250 --> 1:15:37.208
Yes! Not bad. One more.

1:17:57.750 --> 1:18:00.250
Can you help me get loose?

1:20:26.083 --> 1:20:30.083
- His breath isn't to be trifled with.
- No...

1:20:30.166 --> 1:20:33.541
Talk about 70-year-old pure malt.

1:20:33.625 --> 1:20:37.666
The smell isn't so bad,
but it stings my eyes a little.

1:21:57.208 --> 1:22:00.333
Twenty-nine? Now we're getting somewhere.

1:22:00.416 --> 1:22:04.125
- What are you having?
- A draft beer, please.

1:22:05.083 --> 1:22:07.833
A draft beer and a mineral water, please.

1:22:09.291 --> 1:22:12.958
Mineral water? Are you sick?

1:22:13.041 --> 1:22:16.250
No, but I'm going to win this game.

1:22:17.500 --> 1:22:21.375
No booze, eight hours of sleep,
and the rest is golf.

1:22:21.458 --> 1:22:27.125
- What does Carina think about that?
- She's going to Florida with the kids.

1:22:53.333 --> 1:22:55.375
I'm nervous.

1:22:56.416 --> 1:22:58.041
Calm.

1:23:06.458 --> 1:23:08.125
Stig!

1:25:44.125 --> 1:25:49.166
Is he a good teacher?
He mostly goes fishing.

1:25:50.708 --> 1:25:53.791
Stig-Helmer is practicing with the Vardon.

1:25:53.875 --> 1:25:55.791
He made par today.

1:25:55.875 --> 1:26:01.208
Well, that's encouraging,
but who's Vardon?

1:26:01.291 --> 1:26:04.125
It's a kind of robot.

1:26:04.208 --> 1:26:06.958
<i>- Row boat?
- No, not</i> a <i>row</i> boat.

1:26:07.041 --> 1:26:10.916
- Robot!
- I can't hear you. Where are you?

1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:13.041
I'm at the Laughing Duck.

1:26:24.041 --> 1:26:28.166
He's really good. It's going really well.

1:26:28.250 --> 1:26:30.375
Relax!

1:26:30.458 --> 1:26:31.541
Bye!

1:26:32.125 --> 1:26:33.791
Bye.

1:26:35.625 --> 1:26:40.375
A robot and a laughing duck. I see!

1:26:40.458 --> 1:26:42.625
Well, Pablo, it's been nice.

1:26:58.625 --> 1:27:01.208
I can't sing and don't know any lyrics.

1:27:01.291 --> 1:27:04.000
- We can hum...
- What?

1:27:07.083 --> 1:27:09.291
"Anslagstavlan."

1:27:09.375 --> 1:27:11.875
- No.
- Yes!

1:27:12.916 --> 1:27:14.666
Come on!

1:28:06.791 --> 1:28:08.416
Stig-Helmer!

1:28:16.541 --> 1:28:20.708
It's like I said. Life is full
of possibilities, Stig-Helmer.

1:28:20.791 --> 1:28:27.000
You could have checked toasters
until your dying day.

1:28:27.083 --> 1:28:30.833
Now, you're practicing golf in Scotland

1:28:30.916 --> 1:28:34.625
with a British Open champion.

1:28:34.708 --> 1:28:36.375
And you met Fiona.

1:29:18.583 --> 1:29:20.791
Here they come.

1:29:29.666 --> 1:29:34.583
- Hi.
- Hi.

1:29:35.708 --> 1:29:38.875
This is Fiona McDougall.

1:29:38.958 --> 1:29:43.125
This is Roderic McDougall.
He's been coaching Stig-Helmer.

1:29:57.333 --> 1:30:01.750
McDougall's been coaching Olsson?

1:30:01.833 --> 1:30:03.375
Yep.

1:30:03.458 --> 1:30:08.750
Ballesteros wasn't available.
Neither was Jack Nicklaus.

1:30:11.250 --> 1:30:16.458
- I think this has gotten out of hand.
- So do I.

1:30:16.541 --> 1:30:19.750
I think we should stop this childishness.

1:30:19.833 --> 1:30:22.833
So do I, honestly speaking.

1:30:22.916 --> 1:30:26.041
- But unfortunately, it's too late.
- How do you mean?

1:30:26.125 --> 1:30:30.541
Well, we sold the broadcasting rights
for the competition to Scottish TV.

1:30:30.625 --> 1:30:32.166
Too bad.

1:30:34.416 --> 1:30:39.250
You should have given the Board
a few days' notice

1:30:39.333 --> 1:30:43.625
before bringing in a TV crew
and a winner of the British Open.

1:30:43.708 --> 1:30:46.333
I swear I had no idea.

1:30:46.416 --> 1:30:49.625
Sure. We'll discuss it
at the next Board meeting.

1:31:01.750 --> 1:31:03.291
Hey.

1:31:03.375 --> 1:31:08.291
- Keep your head down.
- Focus on the ball and swing gently.

1:31:08.375 --> 1:31:12.166
- And win.
- I'll do my best.

1:31:17.083 --> 1:31:20.333
- I hope we have a good game.
- Thanks.

1:31:20.416 --> 1:31:23.125
I must congratulate you on your hat.

1:31:23.833 --> 1:31:27.750
- I see you're only using irons.
- Yeah.

1:31:28.916 --> 1:31:34.125
I have the lowest handicap,
so I guess I start.

1:32:07.250 --> 1:32:08.958
We'll find it.

1:32:45.750 --> 1:32:47.125
A golf robot, was it?

1:33:14.958 --> 1:33:16.666
YES!

1:33:39.500 --> 1:33:41.125
- Tom!
- Yeah?

1:33:41.208 --> 1:33:43.916
- Am I allowed to move loose objects?
- I think so.

1:33:44.000 --> 1:33:45.625
Bastard!

1:33:45.708 --> 1:33:47.625
HARD TO HIT?
TAKE A LESSON WITH PATRIC!

1:33:47.708 --> 1:33:48.791
Sorry, Bruno.

1:34:02.416 --> 1:34:04.541
Take it easy, Bruno.

1:34:04.625 --> 1:34:06.208
Damn it!

1:34:11.916 --> 1:34:12.750
Goddammit!

1:34:45.125 --> 1:34:47.875
Wait, Bruno! There's a kid in the bunker.

1:34:49.333 --> 1:34:53.916
Hey, kid! This isn't a fucking playground!

1:35:09.375 --> 1:35:12.083
- What the hell is this?
- How cute!

1:35:23.166 --> 1:35:26.375
Fucking kid!

1:35:55.875 --> 1:35:57.500
Unbelievable!

1:36:03.958 --> 1:36:07.416
- Oh, God!
- What do I do now?

1:36:07.500 --> 1:36:13.083
You'll have to wait
until the ball comes out...

1:36:17.541 --> 1:36:18.375
Too bad, Bruno.

1:36:25.375 --> 1:36:27.500
Straight to the hole, Stig-Helmer!

1:36:45.916 --> 1:36:49.416
The kid says you ruined his farm.

1:36:49.500 --> 1:36:53.500
He should stay off the golf course.
This isn't a playground.

1:36:53.583 --> 1:36:57.416
Keep an eye on him. Will you please move?

1:36:58.583 --> 1:37:00.458
Go!

1:37:59.000 --> 1:38:01.375
Do you see the flag?

1:38:02.541 --> 1:38:03.666
Yeah.

1:38:14.041 --> 1:38:18.791
- Aim for the flag and keep your head down.
- Okay.

1:38:30.083 --> 1:38:32.541
It landed in the truck!

1:38:35.458 --> 1:38:37.666
Congrats!

1:38:37.750 --> 1:38:39.416
Thanks!

1:38:40.375 --> 1:38:42.083
Stig-Helmer...

1:38:52.291 --> 1:38:53.666
YES!

1:38:59.791 --> 1:39:01.666
Nice, Bruno.

1:39:03.083 --> 1:39:05.541
Well, little lady, that's that.

1:39:05.625 --> 1:39:07.458
You know where to send the check.

1:39:13.583 --> 1:39:15.375
Gentlemen!

1:39:17.666 --> 1:39:19.833
The match isn't over yet.

1:39:19.916 --> 1:39:23.583
According to rule 19.1,

1:39:23.666 --> 1:39:28.000
Olsson has the right
to play the ball where it lies.

1:39:31.458 --> 1:39:33.791
Rune's Excavation.

1:39:33.875 --> 1:39:35.416
What?

1:39:35.500 --> 1:39:39.666
No, I don't have time.
I'm getting paid by the job.

1:39:39.750 --> 1:39:42.791
Oh? 1,000 kronor? I'm on my way.

1:39:42.875 --> 1:39:45.958
If he makes it in two, you tie.

1:39:48.666 --> 1:39:50.416
But he won't.

1:39:52.000 --> 1:39:54.375
Let's hope not.

1:39:57.416 --> 1:39:59.375
What the hell is he doing here?

1:40:20.916 --> 1:40:23.125
Finally!

1:40:58.958 --> 1:41:00.333
How the hell did he do that?

1:42:07.791 --> 1:42:11.125
One million kronor to Mette Guldbrandsen

1:42:21.041 --> 1:42:23.333
Here. Congrats.

1:42:28.875 --> 1:42:31.583
Use the money to buy yourself some tees.

1:43:41.125 --> 1:43:44.583
What the hell are you doing?
Are you out of your mind?

1:43:44.666 --> 1:43:46.666
- I'm plowing my land.
- What?

1:43:46.750 --> 1:43:49.625
- I'm turning it into an energy forest.
- An energy forest?!

1:43:49.708 --> 1:43:52.000
Like you said, this isn't a playground!

1:47:09.416 --> 1:47:12.333
