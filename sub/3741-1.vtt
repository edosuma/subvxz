Oh, Kathy.

Okay, and big smile.

01:22.958 --> 01:24.376

01:24.585 --> 01:26.253
I will always remember...

01:26.670 --> 01:28.380
...the game against Fairfield.

01:28.589 --> 01:30.382
That one final kick.

01:33.552 --> 01:35.262

01:37.389 --> 01:40.184
...all the great times
with the dirty dozen...

01:40.392 --> 01:42.561
...and macking all
the honeys.

01:43.770 --> 01:45.564
Cindy K. Tina B.

01:45.772 --> 01:47.858

01:48.192 --> 01:49.568
Just too many to remember.

01:50.777 --> 01:54.364
I'll always remember
lacrosse champions.

01:55.365 --> 01:57.576
All the glory days with
the boys.

01:57.784 --> 01:59.161
I will always remember...

01:59.870 --> 02:01.663
...the math-club madmen...

02:02.873 --> 02:04.791
...making the perfect
fake ID's...

02:05.292 --> 02:07.586

02:08.961 --> 02:11.381

02:11.590 --> 02:13.091
-Troy gives good head.

05:15.858 --> 05:18.360
SENIOR PROM

05:19.987 --> 05:22.573
-Do you have the fever?
-No.

05:23.490 --> 05:25.284
Why? Do you?

05:25.993 --> 05:27.953
I don't know. Maybe.

05:28.871 --> 05:30.455
How about you?

05:30.873 --> 05:32.791
I just gotta fuck something.

05:32.958 --> 05:35.586
I said, everybody say, "Ho!"

05:41.383 --> 05:42.759
You know what I say?

05:42.968 --> 05:46.889
I say, this prom is gonna be
off the hook! Do you feel me?

05:53.187 --> 05:55.856
Security's gonna be tight.
Get wasted before you show up.

05:57.274 --> 05:58.984
That's enough!

05:59.193 --> 06:01.653
That's enough. I can wait.

06:01.862 --> 06:04.489
I can wait, people.

06:05.657 --> 06:08.577
Now, it is your
student-council president...

06:08.660 --> 06:11.163
...who has a few announcements
to make.

06:13.290 --> 06:14.666
Thanks, Mr. Salinger.

06:19.588 --> 06:21.882
All right, how you doing?

06:23.884 --> 06:26.762
Okay, let's start off
with Operation Get Samnang.

06:26.970 --> 06:28.972
Sam Young, baby!

06:30.057 --> 06:31.391
Yeah.

06:32.392 --> 06:36.271
Well, we did it.
We raised the 25,000 dollars...

06:36.480 --> 06:39.691
...so now we can bring the genius
Samnang out of Cambodia...

06:39.858 --> 06:41.777
...and bring him here
to study at Westport.

06:44.488 --> 06:48.283
Speaking of which,
Samnang sent us a new tape.

06:48.492 --> 06:50.285
Show that shit!

06:52.454 --> 06:53.872
Show it!

06:54.373 --> 06:57.084
Hi, everyone, it's Samnang.

06:59.086 --> 07:00.879
Sam Young!

07:01.088 --> 07:04.883
I am very excited to be
coming soon. Are you excited?

07:09.388 --> 07:12.975
I told my class that I am coming
to America. They were sad.

07:13.183 --> 07:14.560
I am so happy.

07:14.768 --> 07:17.271
-I wanna bang you!
-Go, Cougars!

07:32.452 --> 07:35.080
How do they just skip class
every day and go to the beach?

07:35.664 --> 07:37.457
Because they just don't care.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.387
Let's go with them.

07:51.889 --> 07:54.183
-Seriously, let's just do it.
-Why?

07:54.558 --> 07:57.060
Because, I mean,
we never do anything.

07:57.269 --> 08:00.272
I mean, we're graduating. We
should be going nuts right now.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.773
Let's just do something.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.984
I am doing something,
I'm going to class.

08:04.359 --> 08:06.361
Klitz, you already got
into Yale.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.071
I mean, it doesn't
matter anymore.

08:08.280 --> 08:09.781
Yeah, Klitz, you pussy.

08:09.990 --> 08:12.784
-Well, why don't you go?
-Yeah, come on. Let's go.

08:12.951 --> 08:14.870
Beach is for fags, man.

08:15.078 --> 08:17.581
-The beach is for fags?
-Yeah.

08:18.790 --> 08:21.668
You know what?
You guys are fags.

08:26.465 --> 08:27.674
Everyone to the beach!

08:29.676 --> 08:32.054
Let's go! Lock them
and load them, dude.

08:33.472 --> 08:34.765
WESTPORT HIGH SCHOOL

08:36.475 --> 08:38.059
Fuck it.

08:56.954 --> 08:58.580
SCHOOL
SECURITY

08:58.872 --> 09:01.583
Personal power means
the ability to act...

09:01.667 --> 09:04.378
...the ability to take action.

09:04.586 --> 09:06.463
STOP
CHECK-OUT WITH SECURITY

09:06.672 --> 09:09.258
Three steps to personal power
are necessary for results.

09:09.466 --> 09:11.093
Here's number one step
to personal power.

09:11.176 --> 09:13.762
It's called energy.
Energy.

09:13.971 --> 09:16.765
When you wake up feeling
really lethargic, really lousy...

09:16.974 --> 09:19.184
...do you usually
jump up and go--?

09:28.360 --> 09:29.653
Oh, shit.

09:50.174 --> 09:52.593
Hey! Pull it over!

09:54.261 --> 09:56.263
Pull it over! Pull--

10:27.252 --> 10:28.754
Oh, well, you're home early.

10:29.087 --> 10:31.256
I postponed yearbook.
I gotta work on my speech

10:31.465 --> 10:33.759
-Hi, Mr. Peterson.
-Mr. President.

10:34.092 --> 10:35.969
-Mrs. Peterson.
-Congratulations.

10:36.178 --> 10:39.056
-Oh, thank you.
-Congratulations. Georgetown.

10:39.264 --> 10:42.059
Wow, you must be flying.

10:42.267 --> 10:43.185
It's cool.

10:43.268 --> 10:44.686
What's the speech
you're working on?

10:44.853 --> 10:47.689
Oh, it's for this scholarship
I need to get so I can...

10:47.773 --> 10:49.858
...actually go to Georgetown.

10:50.067 --> 10:51.652
It's pretty expensive.

10:51.860 --> 10:53.862
What kind of scholarship
is it?

10:51.985 --> 10:54.571
What do they give it for?

10:54.780 --> 10:59.368
It's for the student who best
demonstrates moral fiber.

10:59.576 --> 11:01.453
Oh, moral fiber. Well, that's--

11:01.870 --> 11:04.456
-Oh, I'm sure you'll get it.
-Thanks. I mean, I hope so.

11:04.665 --> 11:06.083
I mean, there's some stiff
Competition...

11:06.166 --> 11:08.669
...and they only pick
one of us...

11:08.877 --> 11:12.256
...so I'll just have to blow
them away with my speech.

11:15.592 --> 11:19.179
Okay, so why do I deserve
this scholarship?

11:19.388 --> 11:21.390
1 . MAKE EYE CONTACT
2. BE CHARMING 3. JFK!

11:21.557 --> 11:24.184
...can do for you
but what you can do...."

11:24.268 --> 11:26.854
John F. Kennedy once said,
"Ask not what

12:01.680 --> 12:03.182
Look, I don't know
who she is.

12:03.390 --> 12:06.476
I'm just saying that
this girl was unbelievable.

12:06.685 --> 12:09.062
I mean, she was
like this angel.

12:09.271 --> 12:12.858
I mean, she had this smile.
I mean, you should have seen it.

12:13.066 --> 12:16.278
-So did you bang her?
-Oh, yeah, yeah. I banged her.

12:16.570 --> 12:18.155
That's what a man does,
okay?

12:18.363 --> 12:21.366
-Yeah. Okay, Eli.
-Good.

12:24.786 --> 12:26.580
Oh, my God. She's so hot.

12:26.788 --> 12:29.666
-What channel, dude?
-No, the girl next door.

12:29.875 --> 12:31.460
I can see her through
my window.

12:31.668 --> 12:32.961
How's the rack?

12:33.253 --> 12:36.465
-God, who is this girl?
-How's the rack?

12:36.673 --> 12:38.383
-Hold on. Relax.
-No. You relax.

12:38.592 --> 12:40.552
Be a man and go over there.

12:40.761 --> 12:42.179
Okay. Say what?

12:42.387 --> 12:44.973
I don't know. Get off your
ass and do something. Fuck!

12:50.062 --> 12:51.772
-Hey, what are you doing?
-What?

12:51.980 --> 12:53.774
Hey, dude, seriously,
I told you...

12:53.982 --> 12:56.193
...it really freaks me out
when you watch that while...

12:56.276 --> 12:57.569
...you're talking to me.

12:57.778 --> 13:00.072
Just learn to like it.

13:05.452 --> 13:08.080
Oh, my God.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.582
What? Matt, what?

13:10.791 --> 13:12.084
Matt!

13:18.257 --> 13:20.384
Dude, what the fuck?

13:39.778 --> 13:41.154
Shit!

14:11.685 --> 14:13.854
-Yes?
-I'm sorry.

14:15.480 --> 14:18.275
-Dan.
-What's going on?

14:18.775 --> 14:19.484
Matthew!

14:20.485 --> 14:22.779
Matthew, come down here.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.877
-What are you doing up there?
-Nothing.

14:37.085 --> 14:39.087
Come down here.

14:46.553 --> 14:47.888
This is Danielle.

14:48.055 --> 14:51.975
You know Mrs. Clark from
next door. Danielle's her niece.

14:52.684 --> 14:55.062
Danielle just told us
something very interesting.

14:56.063 --> 14:59.691
Mrs. Clark is in Africa for
two weeks with her church group.

14:59.858 --> 15:01.193
Did you know that?

15:02.569 --> 15:05.072
Anyway, Danielle just came
in from Los Angeles...

15:05.280 --> 15:08.075
...and she's housesitting
while her aunt's away.

15:08.283 --> 15:09.785
Why don't you show
her around.

15:19.962 --> 15:22.256
Such a long road, you know.

15:30.764 --> 15:33.976
-What are we doing?
-Did you like what you saw?

15:34.393 --> 15:36.353
What are you talking about?

15:38.355 --> 15:41.692
Okay, I saw you for,
like, an instant.

15:41.859 --> 15:43.360
-An instant?
-Yeah.

15:43.569 --> 15:45.070
It was no big deal.

15:46.780 --> 15:51.451
No, no, it was-- It was a
big deal, but it's just that....

15:51.660 --> 15:53.453
I didn't....

15:56.290 --> 15:58.083
I'm sorry.

15:58.292 --> 15:59.877
I'm sorry.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.172
So, what are we gonna
do about this?

16:04.965 --> 16:07.092
I mean, I said I was sorry.

16:11.388 --> 16:12.764
What?

16:12.973 --> 16:14.266
You saw me....

16:16.685 --> 16:18.979
Yeah, right, like I'm gonna
strip right here?

16:22.566 --> 16:24.067
Are you serious?

16:27.279 --> 16:28.989
No.

16:30.073 --> 16:32.784
No. No, never gonna happen.

16:35.954 --> 16:37.789
The whole package.

16:37.956 --> 16:39.583
No, come on,
this is good enough.

16:42.169 --> 16:44.463
Jesus! Come on,
will you relax?

16:46.882 --> 16:48.467
Frigging psycho.

16:55.974 --> 16:58.268
There. You happy now?

17:03.482 --> 17:04.775
Yep.

17:06.652 --> 17:09.279
Hey! Wait!

17:09.988 --> 17:11.990
No!

17:13.282 --> 17:15.953
Jesus. Sorry.

17:24.670 --> 17:26.755
You're an asshole.
It's not funny.

17:26.964 --> 17:28.966
It's a little funny.

17:31.969 --> 17:33.387
Come on.

17:33.554 --> 17:35.889
Let me in. Let me in.

17:47.568 --> 17:49.278
It's not funny.

17:49.486 --> 17:51.154
It's a little funny.

18:02.457 --> 18:05.460
So, what else do you do
besides torture people?

18:07.588 --> 18:09.882
-Seriously, what's your story?
-I don't know.

18:10.966 --> 18:12.676
I kind of just quit my job.

18:13.677 --> 18:16.555
I want to start over.
Maybe go to college.

18:21.977 --> 18:26.690
So are you here
alone or what?

18:26.857 --> 18:28.984
-What?
-Just ask.

18:34.573 --> 18:37.784
Do you have a boyfriend?

18:38.660 --> 18:40.162
No.

18:42.456 --> 18:46.084
Aren't you gonna ask me
if I have a girlfriend?

18:48.086 --> 18:49.254
No.01:18:45.04\01:18:46.13
Okay.

18:49.588 --> 18:52.591
So you're about to graduate.
You must be going nuts right now.

18:54.384 --> 18:55.761
Yeah.

18:55.969 --> 19:00.182
I mean, it's just been
off the hook, you know?

19:00.474 --> 19:02.059
-Really?
-Yeah.

19:03.268 --> 19:05.562
So, what's the craziest thing
you've done lately?

19:05.771 --> 19:08.273
Oh, I mean, it's hard to tell,
you know, because we--

19:08.482 --> 19:11.068
I've just done so much
nuts stuff. I mean....

19:11.568 --> 19:14.488
It's just off the hook,
off the walls. I mean....

19:14.655 --> 19:17.282
You haven't done anything,
have you?

19:18.492 --> 19:19.785
No.

19:20.661 --> 19:23.455
It's kind of-- It's kind
of been my problem lately.

19:23.664 --> 19:26.083
Come on, there's gotta
be something.

19:26.875 --> 19:28.377
What about your girlfriend?

19:31.380 --> 19:32.589
Okay.

19:32.756 --> 19:35.759
We can figure this out.
You just need a girl.

19:36.176 --> 19:38.178
What kind of girl?

19:39.680 --> 19:41.390
Definitely someone cute.

19:41.890 --> 19:43.559
Definitely.

19:44.560 --> 19:47.062
Someone who can make
him laugh.

19:49.565 --> 19:51.775
But he also needs someone
who's gonna push him.

19:53.277 --> 19:55.153
Someone who's gonna
make him do...

19:55.279 --> 19:57.155
...things he never thought
he could do.

19:57.990 --> 20:00.868
Like stripping
in the middle of the street?

20:23.557 --> 20:26.560
-Well, thanks for the ride.
-No problem.

20:34.484 --> 20:36.278
Well...

20:37.487 --> 20:39.072
...good night.

20:39.281 --> 20:40.657
Good night.

20:45.871 --> 20:46.872
"Good night"?
What are you, gay?

20:49.082 --> 20:52.085
-I would have nailed her.
-Ok, you wouldn't have nailed her.

20:52.252 --> 20:54.588
-Whatever, dude.
-And, you know, secondly...

20:54.755 --> 20:57.466
...you know,
the vibe was not right.

20:57.674 --> 21:00.969
The vibe wasn't right? She comes
to your house and makes you strip.

21:01.178 --> 21:03.680
What does she have to do,
sit on your face?

21:04.681 --> 21:06.266
Come on, bitch.

21:06.975 --> 21:10.187
-Damn. Should have kissed her.
-Are you okay? Dude?

21:11.480 --> 21:14.066
All right, you all have
this graph, correct?

21:14.274 --> 21:16.652
Good. Let's move along then.

21:16.985 --> 21:18.654
Now, it's a very simple
equation here.

21:18.779 --> 21:21.073
Somebody give me
the answer to this.

21:23.992 --> 21:26.370
All right, if no one knows
the answer to this....

21:27.871 --> 21:30.791
Looking at this calculation,
what does this make us think of?

21:35.963 --> 21:37.756
Questions on this?

22:04.283 --> 22:08.161
Good news, ladies and gentlemen.
Pop-quiz time.

22:52.372 --> 22:55.459
That's Samnang Sok.
He's this complete genius.

22:55.667 --> 22:57.669
So we raised all
this money for him...

22:57.753 --> 22:59.880
...to come here and
study at our school.

23:00.088 --> 23:03.258
-Who's "we"?
-Well, I mean, I did...

23:03.467 --> 23:05.969
...but he could be
the next Einstein, you know.

23:06.678 --> 23:08.680
You know,
he could cure cancer.

23:17.064 --> 23:18.857
Let's go.

23:23.362 --> 23:25.364
So, what do you wanna do?

23:28.575 --> 23:29.868
What?

23:32.871 --> 23:34.289
I'm not stripping again.

23:35.165 --> 23:36.875
Come on.

23:51.265 --> 23:52.975
Danielle!

23:54.393 --> 23:55.978
Come on.
Where are you going?

24:09.867 --> 24:11.869
Hey, come on,
let's get out of here.

24:12.578 --> 24:14.788
How do you know
no one's home?

24:14.955 --> 24:16.582
-I don't.
-Come on.

24:16.790 --> 24:18.292
Seriously, this is nuts.

24:29.761 --> 24:31.263
Oh, boxers.

24:31.763 --> 24:36.268
I always wear boxers. You just
caught me on a weird day.

24:47.988 --> 24:51.658
So, what's the craziest thing
you've done lately?

24:54.786 --> 24:56.163
This is right up there.

25:09.176 --> 25:11.178
Oh, my God.

25:13.972 --> 25:15.766
-That's Mr. Salinger.
-Who?

25:15.974 --> 25:17.976
That's my principal.
Seriously, let's go.

25:19.770 --> 25:22.272
-It's not funny.
-It's a little funny.

25:24.983 --> 25:26.777
Hey.

25:29.154 --> 25:31.156
Just go with it.

25:51.552 --> 25:54.471
Dude, I'm kind of uncomfortable
watching this with you.

25:54.680 --> 25:57.182
Dude, learn to like it.

26:02.479 --> 26:04.189
I'm all wet. Can I come in?

26:11.071 --> 26:14.157
Hey, guys. This is Danielle.

26:14.491 --> 26:17.578
You must be Eli. And Klitz.
Right.

26:17.786 --> 26:19.663
Hey, come on,
we're all going out.

26:19.872 --> 26:24.585
-Can I use your bathroom first?
-Oh, it's over here to the left.

26:30.674 --> 26:33.385
-Dude.
-I know.

26:33.552 --> 26:35.387
Dude.

26:35.554 --> 26:36.889
I know.

26:52.487 --> 26:54.573
-Dude, what are we doing here?
-Yeah, I know.

26:54.781 --> 26:56.158
Guys, seriously, it's gonna get...

26:56.283 --> 26:58.076
...broken up, like,
any second now, right?

26:59.953 --> 27:01.288
Guys?

27:13.884 --> 27:15.969
-Get the fuck out of here!
-Sorry.

27:28.565 --> 27:30.275
Go.

27:31.068 --> 27:33.987
-So, what do you wanna do?
-Let's just chill.

27:34.154 --> 27:35.864
Hi, guys.

27:37.991 --> 27:40.953
-Is this your party?
-No, it's a friend of mine's.

27:41.370 --> 27:43.580
-I'm Hunter.
-Danielle.

27:43.789 --> 27:45.582
This is Matthew.

27:45.791 --> 27:48.085
-Hey, Matt, what's up?
-What's up?

27:48.669 --> 27:50.254
Can I get you something
to drink?

27:50.879 --> 27:52.172
-Yeah.
-Hey, man, what's up?

27:52.381 --> 27:54.174
-Can you come here for a second?
-Yeah.

27:54.383 --> 27:56.468
No, it's cool. They're pals.

27:57.386 --> 27:58.679
What's up?

27:58.887 --> 28:01.473
Yeah, man, this party's
getting kind of full, bro.

28:01.682 --> 28:05.060
-Yeah, so?
-So you're gonna have to take off.

28:05.269 --> 28:07.688
-Really?
-Yeah.

28:09.481 --> 28:12.276
Okay, but I'm with her.
I mean--

28:12.484 --> 28:14.486
Oh, it's cool, dude.
She's taken care of.

28:18.782 --> 28:20.492
There's the door.

28:44.975 --> 28:46.768
Yo, man!

28:46.977 --> 28:49.354
When's Samsung getting here?

28:49.563 --> 28:52.191
-Samnang.
-Yeah!

28:52.858 --> 28:54.276
I love him.

28:54.484 --> 28:58.655
Dude, I'm gonna do that little
guy when he gets here.

28:58.864 --> 29:00.657
Hard.

29:02.075 --> 29:04.286
Cool, dude.
I'm sure he'll like that.

29:04.453 --> 29:06.663
Sam Young!

29:10.584 --> 29:12.169
Excuse me.

29:27.976 --> 29:30.854
-Dude.
-I know.

30:09.768 --> 30:12.688
-What?
-You're coming with me. Right now.

30:14.064 --> 30:16.567
Everybody out. Let's move.

30:20.654 --> 30:25.492
I said out, minions! Move! Move!
Faster, you little maggots.

30:27.953 --> 30:30.956
-So how's everything going?
-Fine.

30:31.164 --> 30:33.792
Is everything, you know,
okay at home?

30:33.959 --> 30:35.752
All right, what?

30:36.253 --> 30:38.088
Perhaps you should have a seat.

30:38.255 --> 30:40.757
Perhaps you should bite me.

30:41.258 --> 30:42.968
Perhaps.

30:45.971 --> 30:47.472
Matthew...

30:47.681 --> 30:50.684
...we live in a crazy,
mixed-up world.

30:50.893 --> 30:54.271
Crazy, but, oh, so beautiful.

31:12.372 --> 31:14.458
Excellent, grasshopper.

31:14.666 --> 31:18.253
And now for the final task
of your training.

31:22.591 --> 31:25.469
You're gonna need a harder piece
of wood than that, cowboy.

31:26.887 --> 31:29.681
-That's not her.
-Yeah, it is.

31:38.857 --> 31:41.485
-Oh, no.
-Oh, yeah.

31:50.953 --> 31:53.872
Matt! Matt! Dude, you're
missing the best part.

31:56.458 --> 31:58.085
Fuck! Fuck!

32:00.254 --> 32:01.880
Settle down, tiger.
I know. I know.

32:02.089 --> 32:04.174
It's not funny.
Seriously, get away from me.

32:04.383 --> 32:06.760
-Dude, don't mess this up.
-Mess what up?

32:06.969 --> 32:08.554
Matt, she's a porn star,
okay?

32:08.887 --> 32:11.557
Take her to a motel room
and bang her like a beast.

32:11.890 --> 32:13.559
Eli, I like this girl.

32:13.767 --> 32:16.562
And you can still like her
with your penis inside her.

32:17.187 --> 32:19.356
I'm telling you,
you're gonna regret this.

32:19.565 --> 32:21.775
What would JFK do?
You know he'd tap that ass.

32:21.984 --> 32:23.986
Eli, I'm never gonna
see her again.

32:24.152 --> 32:25.362
Oh, you know what? Fine.

32:25.571 --> 32:26.989
-Fine.
-Fine!

32:27.781 --> 32:28.991
Goddamn it, Matt.

32:29.074 --> 32:32.160
I swear to God, if you don't
fuck her, I'll kill myself!

32:32.369 --> 32:38.292
Matt, please. Please, Matt.
Fuck her for me. For me!

32:50.262 --> 32:52.764
-Oh, Marci, you're so funny.
-Oh, thanks.

32:55.893 --> 32:58.353
-I just saw you naked.
-What?

32:58.687 --> 33:01.064
Don't worry, honey,
you were only 2 days old.

33:01.356 --> 33:03.483
-Let's see what else we have.
-Why are you here?

33:03.692 --> 33:05.068
I just came here to say hi.

33:06.069 --> 33:07.654
Hi.

33:07.863 --> 33:09.364
Look at this one of him.

33:18.165 --> 33:19.791
Hey, buddy.

33:20.375 --> 33:23.253
-That one's the best.
-It is. He looks so adorable.

33:23.462 --> 33:25.589
He looks really--
Oh, that's such a good one.

33:25.756 --> 33:28.467
-Here you go, Danielle.
-Oh, thanks.

33:36.391 --> 33:38.685
-Thattagirl.
-This is a cute one.

33:38.852 --> 33:40.687
Oh, who's your daddy?

33:41.188 --> 33:44.358
So you were going to school
in Los Angeles?

33:44.566 --> 33:47.361
For a while. But then I started
working on other things.

33:47.569 --> 33:49.780
Oh, what kind of things?

33:51.990 --> 33:53.283
Let me show you.

34:02.584 --> 34:03.877
Jesus!

34:08.465 --> 34:10.884
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I don't know, I....

34:11.552 --> 34:13.178
I don't feel so good.

34:17.891 --> 34:20.351
What can I do to make you
feel better?

34:35.367 --> 34:37.159
I think I'm feeling
a lot better now.

34:37.369 --> 34:40.371
-We can go out another night.
-No, we're going out tonight.

34:40.873 --> 34:43.292
-You sure?
-Positive.

34:47.254 --> 34:50.090
-I don't know if I can do this.
-Yes, you can.

34:50.257 --> 34:53.051
But tonight, be the man.

34:53.677 --> 34:56.763
First off, act like
you don't even like her.

34:56.972 --> 34:59.558
-Hey.
-Hey.

34:59.766 --> 35:04.354
Second, get her drunk.
Really drunk, okay?

35:04.688 --> 35:07.191
That way the true porn star
will come out in her.

35:10.569 --> 35:13.989
Here, I... I got us something.

35:17.075 --> 35:19.077
Bourbon?

35:19.286 --> 35:22.581
-Are you trying to get me drunk?
-No, what?

35:22.789 --> 35:26.668
-I thought you like to rock.
-"Like to rock?"

35:27.252 --> 35:29.755
Last and most important...

35:30.088 --> 35:32.257
...always be touching her,
Matt.

35:32.466 --> 35:35.052
That tells her you came here
to get down tonight.

35:38.889 --> 35:40.891
What are we doing?

35:42.059 --> 35:43.977
Just chilling.

35:48.065 --> 35:49.983
Hey, look.

35:50.484 --> 35:51.777
MOTEL
Glen Capri

35:54.571 --> 36:00.285
Maybe we should get a room.

36:01.286 --> 36:02.788
Okay.

36:09.753 --> 36:11.755
Here it is.

36:30.774 --> 36:33.652
This is-- This is really nice.

36:34.069 --> 36:35.988
TV.

36:36.488 --> 36:37.865
Air conditioner.

36:38.782 --> 36:40.993
Got a little lamp there.

36:41.869 --> 36:43.954
Is that Monet?

36:47.958 --> 36:49.668
What?

36:50.169 --> 36:53.380
-What are you thinking?
-What are you thinking?

36:56.383 --> 36:57.676
I don't know.

37:07.978 --> 37:09.563
Do you wanna fuck me?

37:17.154 --> 37:19.281
Come here.

37:36.590 --> 37:38.175
How do you want me?

37:39.885 --> 37:41.386
Why are you doing this?

37:42.554 --> 37:44.264
What?

37:44.890 --> 37:46.558
This.

37:48.352 --> 37:50.854
Isn't this what you want?

37:51.271 --> 37:54.274
To fuck a porn star
in a cheap motel room?

37:59.279 --> 38:01.865
So this is what
you think of me.

38:04.284 --> 38:06.286
-Danielle, wait. I'm sorry.
-Let me guess.

38:06.453 --> 38:08.080
You saw a tape,
and you thought:

38:08.288 --> 38:10.582
"What the hell?
She does it for a living, right?"

38:10.791 --> 38:14.086
-Eli told me to do it.
-Oh, now that's a mature response.

38:14.253 --> 38:17.464
-Why didn't you just tell me?
-Because I didn't want to, okay?

38:20.467 --> 38:23.262
Because I loved the way
you looked at me.

38:24.763 --> 38:28.058
God, do you have
any idea how--?

38:29.476 --> 38:30.978
Forget it.

38:31.270 --> 38:34.690
-Hold on.
-Fuck you.

38:48.954 --> 38:50.956
ONLY 9 DAYS LEFT!
SAMNANG

38:56.086 --> 38:57.754
You're done.

39:03.969 --> 39:05.262
WHY DO I DESERVE
THIS SCHOLARSHIP?

39:22.070 --> 39:27.659
Look, I'm an idiot, okay?
I saw the tape, and I freaked out.

39:27.868 --> 39:30.662
Hi. I'm coming in.
Can I come in?

39:32.080 --> 39:34.082
Look, I've just
been crazy lately.

39:34.291 --> 39:37.669
I mean, the whole scholarship
thing, you know, I mean....

39:37.878 --> 39:39.463
It's killing me, you know?

39:39.755 --> 39:42.466
But I'm not even
thinking about that.

39:42.758 --> 39:47.054
The only thing I care about
is you, you know?

39:47.262 --> 39:49.890
All I want is just for us
to go back to normal again.

39:50.057 --> 39:53.185
It's a real nice place
you got here, D.

39:54.269 --> 39:56.188
I...

40:08.492 --> 40:09.952
Can we...

40:10.786 --> 40:13.455
-...talk about this later?
-Yeah.

40:15.958 --> 40:17.376
Sure.

40:34.268 --> 40:35.561
I like that.

40:36.353 --> 40:39.273
-What?
-What you said in there.

40:39.773 --> 40:41.066
Thanks.

40:46.488 --> 40:47.865
Kelly.

40:48.866 --> 40:50.492
Matthew.

40:55.455 --> 40:57.791
-So you're friends with D, huh?
-Yeah.

40:58.292 --> 41:02.087
Well, we're-
We're kind of going out.

41:04.756 --> 41:09.469
Look at you.
You are a forest fire.

41:10.262 --> 41:11.889
-Are we going?
-Yeah.

41:12.472 --> 41:13.765
You coming with us?

41:13.974 --> 41:16.560
-Where are you going?
-Can't. He's got school tomorrow.

41:17.060 --> 41:19.062
No, no, I'm cool.
Like, where are we going?

41:47.174 --> 41:49.092
Hey, there.
What can I get for you?

41:49.176 --> 41:51.178
We'll get two Scotch
rocks and....

41:51.386 --> 41:55.057
Make it three. Actually, I'll
have a Long lsland iced tea.

41:58.685 --> 42:00.187
So, what grade are
you in, man?

42:00.270 --> 42:03.065
I'm a senior.
But I'm about to graduate.

42:03.273 --> 42:05.484
Congratulations. What's next?

42:05.859 --> 42:07.277
Georgetown, hopefully.

42:07.861 --> 42:10.364
-Matthew wants to be president.
-Really?

42:10.656 --> 42:12.157
-That's great, man.
-Yeah.

42:12.366 --> 42:14.368
How do you
two know each other?

42:14.952 --> 42:17.371
How do we know each other?

42:17.955 --> 42:21.792
-We used to work together.
-So you're, like, an actor?

42:22.793 --> 42:25.379
No. Strictly producer.

42:25.587 --> 42:29.466
But D and I also used to go out.
Excuse me a sec.

42:31.385 --> 42:32.678
So you guys went out?

42:34.972 --> 42:36.473
Thank you.

42:36.682 --> 42:38.684
Look, can we just talk?

42:39.476 --> 42:40.769
Talk.

42:42.271 --> 42:44.356
I don't know if this
is really the place.

42:44.565 --> 42:49.152
-Why? What's wrong with it?
-No, nothing. It's fine, you know.

42:49.361 --> 42:51.363
It's one of my favorites.

42:56.285 --> 42:58.579
Hey, you got one for me?

43:07.588 --> 43:09.256
-What are you doing?
-What?

43:09.464 --> 43:10.966
Here.

43:12.593 --> 43:14.761
And you turn it like so:

43:21.351 --> 43:25.564
-Hey, where are you going?
-The bathroom. Is that okay?

43:25.856 --> 43:27.566
Yeah.

43:30.861 --> 43:33.280
So you're really into her,
huh?

43:33.488 --> 43:37.576
Hey. I get it, man, believe me.
She's gorgeous.

43:38.076 --> 43:40.370
I just think you'd want
someone more your age.

43:40.871 --> 43:45.375
-She's my age.
-Yeah, I meant experience-wise.

43:45.584 --> 43:47.252
No offense.

43:48.462 --> 43:51.089
Don't worry about it.
I'm gonna take care of you.

43:52.966 --> 43:55.385
Oh, my God.
That's Mr. Peterson.

43:55.552 --> 44:56.655
That's my dad's
friend.

43:56.762 --> 43:58.889
He comes over all
the time with his wife.

43:59.473 --> 44:00.682
Really?

44:01.058 --> 44:01.892
Hey, Peterson.

44:01.975 --> 44:05.270
What? Dude,
what are you doing, man?

44:05.479 --> 44:07.981
Yeah, you. Get over here.

44:08.357 --> 44:12.486
Goddamn, Peterson, haven't
seen your black ass in ages.

44:12.653 --> 44:15.781
-Do I know you?
-What the fuck's your problem?

44:16.073 --> 44:19.493
-I....
-Just fucking with you, man.

44:20.285 --> 44:23.163
Hey, you know my friend
Matty here, right?

44:27.793 --> 44:32.464
-Matthew. Hi.
-Peterson, this is Matty's first time.

44:32.673 --> 44:35.676
Why don't you buy him a dance.

44:41.265 --> 44:44.476
So did you hear about
that scholarship yet?

44:46.562 --> 44:48.564
No, big dinner's on Thursday.

44:52.693 --> 44:56.864
So, what's it for again?

44:57.072 --> 44:59.157
The scholarship.

45:00.367 --> 45:02.369
It's for...

45:02.578 --> 45:04.663
...moral fiber.

45:07.457 --> 45:10.377
Me? A Teenage Daddy?

45:10.586 --> 45:13.088
Who is this guy?
Is he a porn producer?

45:13.172 --> 45:15.257
Klitz, shut up.
Now, the strippers.

45:15.465 --> 45:18.760
When you get a lap dance, were they
cool with you grabbing their ass?

45:18.969 --> 45:21.054
Dude. I'm trying to talk
about Danielle here.

45:21.263 --> 45:23.891
Fine. Selfish bitch.

45:24.057 --> 45:27.978
For teenagers, sexual intercourse
can be dangerous.

45:28.187 --> 45:29.771
Jesus, what hack made this?

45:30.063 --> 45:32.858
I could make a better sex-ed
film with my mom.

45:33.066 --> 45:34.860
Why don't they update this thing?

45:35.152 --> 45:37.362
Special events,
such as your senior prom...

45:37.571 --> 45:40.657
...place added pressure on young
teens to lose their virginity...

45:40.991 --> 45:43.368
...and also engage
in unprotected sex.

45:43.660 --> 45:45.370
9 months later...

45:46.955 --> 45:48.790
-Hello?
-Hey, Bob.

45:48.957 --> 45:50.167
We're all going
to the creek tonight.

45:50.292 --> 45:53.170
It's gonna be a gas.
You're coming, right?

45:53.253 --> 45:55.380
I can't, guys.

45:56.381 --> 45:59.468
I have a baby now.

46:00.886 --> 46:03.180
Because of prom.

46:03.555 --> 46:05.182
Dude.

46:06.892 --> 46:10.187
-What?
-Yeah, right.

46:10.687 --> 46:14.775
-You guys ever thought about it?
-No.

46:16.485 --> 46:18.362
I just think you guys
would be really hot.

46:18.654 --> 46:20.364
-You girls are 18, right?
-I am.

46:20.572 --> 46:22.574
-I will be in a month.
-Really?

46:22.866 --> 46:25.160
-You ever been photographed?
-A couple of times.

46:25.369 --> 46:27.788
Hey, you guys know Matty?

46:27.955 --> 46:30.874
I hung with him last night.
Guy's the tits.

46:31.375 --> 46:33.669
Here's my man.

46:34.253 --> 46:37.256
-How you doing?
-What's up, fellas?

46:40.175 --> 46:43.053
Matty, you didn't tell me
you got some serious burners...

46:43.178 --> 46:44.263
...at your school here.

46:44.471 --> 46:46.265
Oh, shut up.
You did not say that

46:46.557 --> 46:49.268
Hey, you know who's got
the killer bud?

46:51.270 --> 46:53.772
This fucker right here.

46:55.274 --> 46:57.568
-What are you talking about?
-Yeah, come on.

46:57.776 --> 46:59.570
Yeah, you have some?

46:59.778 --> 47:01.280
Yeah, come on.

47:01.655 --> 47:04.283
-Holy shit.
-You guys should party.

47:04.491 --> 47:06.577
-Can I--?
-All right, we're out.

47:06.869 --> 47:08.954
-Hold on a sec.
-Where are you guys going?

47:09.162 --> 47:11.290
-We got things to do.
-Do you wanna hang out?

47:11.456 --> 47:15.252
-Hop in, fellas.
-Aren't you gonna photograph us?

47:18.172 --> 47:19.965
Always leave
them wanting more.

47:20.174 --> 47:21.967
Punch it!

47:37.691 --> 47:40.986
Man, there is
some talent here.

47:41.653 --> 47:44.573
You get those girls together
with those ass-bags there...

47:44.781 --> 47:47.075
...shoot them humping at,
like, a football...

47:47.159 --> 47:49.578
...game or at a prom,
that video would sell.

47:49.786 --> 47:51.788
Fuck, I'm good!

47:52.080 --> 47:56.168
How do I get these ideas?
It's like a gift, you know?

47:56.376 --> 47:57.878
It's like I can't control it.

48:01.882 --> 48:05.469
So, what are we doing, man?

48:09.389 --> 48:11.683
You know, you really didn't
have to come with me.

48:11.892 --> 48:15.562
It's cool.
I like running errands.

48:16.855 --> 48:20.192
So you raised 25 G's just
to bring this Chinese guy over.

48:20.359 --> 48:22.569
No, he's Cambodian.

48:22.861 --> 48:26.365
Okay, so that's 25,000
total deposited...

48:26.573 --> 48:29.159
...into the Operation
Get Samnang account.

48:29.576 --> 48:31.870
Hey, so you raised
all the money you needed.

48:32.079 --> 48:33.664
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

48:33.872 --> 48:36.083
So is this Samnang
really as smart as they say?

48:36.291 --> 48:39.086
Well, he did teach himself
calculus without even using...

48:39.169 --> 48:40.671
..his textbooks, so....

48:40.879 --> 48:44.758
Those crazy little fuckers, man.
They sure know their numbers.

48:47.386 --> 48:50.973
Jeannie, this is my--
This is my student advisor.

48:50.180 --> 49:03.569
They really compliment
your coloring.

48:51.682 --> 48:53.559
Oh, you're Mr. Salinger?

48:53.976 --> 48:57.354
Just here to make sure
everything's up to par. Wow.

48:57.688 --> 49:00.566
-What?
-I love those earrings.

49:00.774 --> 49:01.066
Oh, thank you.

49:03.777 --> 49:05.654
Thanks. I just got back
from Cabo.

49:05.988 --> 49:07.364
-Did you?
-Yeah.

49:07.573 --> 49:10.367
Okay, well, we gotta go.
Thanks, Jeannie.

49:11.660 --> 49:13.787
Man, what were you doing--?

49:13.954 --> 49:16.081
There's a bar,
you sit with the people.

49:16.164 --> 49:17.082
You have been there.

49:17.291 --> 49:19.376
-See? I knew it.
-No, no.

49:19.585 --> 49:22.671
-This guy is unbelievable.
-You.

49:32.055 --> 49:34.683
-Where you guys going?
-Vegas, baby.

49:34.975 --> 49:39.855
We got the convention. Gotta press
the flesh, meet the fans.

49:40.063 --> 49:42.983
So that's it?
You're just going back?

49:43.192 --> 49:45.152
I don't belong here.

49:45.360 --> 49:48.989
What do you--? What do you mean?
What about starting over?

49:49.573 --> 49:50.991
This is what I am.

49:54.578 --> 49:57.372
All right, D, let's roll.

50:15.265 --> 50:18.852
-Dude, it's not your fault.
-No, it is my fault.

50:19.353 --> 50:22.481
If I hadn't been such a dick and
taken her to that motel room....

50:22.689 --> 50:25.067
Yeah, it was a little forward,
don't you think?

50:26.193 --> 50:27.653
-Dude.
-What?

50:27.986 --> 50:30.572
Matt, the point is,
she made her decision.

50:31.073 --> 50:33.492
There's nothing
you can do about it now.

50:38.664 --> 50:40.165
Yeah, there is.

50:47.589 --> 50:48.882
-Hey, Dad?
-Don't wait up.

50:49.091 --> 50:51.385
-I'll be late tonight.
-I'll watch it tomorrow.

50:51.552 --> 50:54.763
-Shark Week is all week long.
-God, I just wanna bang hot chicks.

51:06.984 --> 51:13.073
LAS VEGAS WELCOMES
THE ADULT FILM CONVENTION

51:43.061 --> 51:45.856
-Move it.
-Sorry.

51:46.857 --> 51:48.066
Big smile.

51:50.277 --> 51:52.154
-Sasha!
-Sasha!

51:58.785 --> 52:01.788
-Yo, man, no press.
-No, no. No, I'm not press.

52:02.164 --> 52:03.665
I'm still in high school,
okay?

52:03.790 --> 52:05.667
This is for my high school
video yearbook.

52:05.876 --> 52:07.169
I swear to God.

52:10.756 --> 52:12.174
That's right, bitch.

52:18.555 --> 52:20.057
Jesus, is that her?

52:20.390 --> 52:21.558
Athena.

52:42.162 --> 52:44.081
Give me a second, guys.

52:44.373 --> 52:45.958
-Athena!
-Athena!

52:46.166 --> 52:48.460
-Danielle.
-Athena! Athena!

52:48.669 --> 52:50.754
-Danielle.
-Come on! Athena, right here!

52:50.963 --> 52:54.383
-Work it, Athena.
-You are so hot, Athena.

52:57.177 --> 53:01.473
-Look, I'm sorry. I had to come.
-Asshole, I'm next.

53:02.391 --> 53:05.185
-I feel like this is all my fault.
-Who is this guy?

53:06.061 --> 53:09.982
-Will you at least look at me?
-Bend over.

53:10.190 --> 53:12.693
You're the best thing that
ever happened to me, okay?

53:12.860 --> 53:14.778
-Me too!
-Oh, Danielle.

53:14.987 --> 53:16.864
He's so sweet.

53:20.367 --> 53:21.869
Danielle.

53:22.160 --> 53:24.580
Nice job, dickwad.

53:24.872 --> 53:27.457
-Danielle.
-Hey, man, get me out of this thing.

53:27.666 --> 53:29.293
-Take me with you, dude.
-Danielle.

53:29.585 --> 53:32.087
Just leave me alone, please.

53:32.462 --> 53:34.464
Danielle.

53:35.966 --> 53:39.386
-Danielle, Danielle.
-Hugo, hi.

53:39.553 --> 53:42.055
Look at you.
You look fantastic.

53:45.184 --> 53:47.477
Just starting out,
and everyone knows your name.

53:47.686 --> 53:49.188
No, they don't.

53:49.354 --> 53:51.773
-So how's Kelly treating you?
-Okay.

53:51.982 --> 53:53.984
Just okay?

53:54.193 --> 53:56.361
Danielle, what do we know?

53:57.154 --> 54:00.991
What do we know? We know
that you should be with me.

54:01.158 --> 54:05.162
At the top.
Where the air is crisp.

54:05.370 --> 54:07.372
-Nice tan.
-Kelly.

54:07.581 --> 54:10.459
-What do we say?
-Fuck you.

54:11.877 --> 54:13.754
Always with the big words.

54:13.962 --> 54:17.674
Danielle,
where the air is crisp.

54:19.593 --> 54:22.679
-What does that mean?
-Nothing. He's just being Hugo.

54:23.263 --> 54:25.974
Matty. What are you doing here?

54:28.185 --> 54:31.271
Look, Kelly, no offense, but I
really don't think Danielle...

54:31.480 --> 54:32.856
...wants to be here right now.

54:37.569 --> 54:40.989
Matthew, please just go home,
okay?

54:42.991 --> 54:44.785
Hey, D.

54:46.286 --> 54:49.790
I'm sorry, man. Come on.
Let's get out of here.

54:53.961 --> 54:55.587
What's up?

54:56.672 --> 54:58.590
It's not cute anymore.

54:58.757 --> 55:00.968
-What?
-Stop filling her head with that--

55:01.176 --> 55:04.680
-Do not piss me off.
-Hey, I thought we were friends.

55:06.181 --> 55:08.267
Friends don't fuck
with each other's business.

55:08.475 --> 55:11.353
And that's what this is,
my fucking business.

55:14.481 --> 55:15.858
What?

55:16.984 --> 55:19.152
What are you gonna do?

55:22.573 --> 55:27.452
Yeah, that's what I thought.
Stay the fuck away from her.

55:31.373 --> 55:34.084
Matt, seriously, man,
it's 2:00 in the morning.

55:34.293 --> 55:37.754
What about your thing tomorrow?
Okay, the scholarship dinner?

55:38.380 --> 55:41.091
Sorry, I gotta do this.

55:46.680 --> 55:50.184
Oh, by the way, if things get
bad, just bolt, okay?

55:50.392 --> 55:52.352
What? What do you mean,
"if things get bad"?

55:52.561 --> 55:53.854
Just bolt.

55:54.688 --> 55:55.480
Wait, what's he
talking about?

55:59.776 --> 56:02.070
You wanna get me a drink?
No, I'm just kidding.

56:14.374 --> 56:15.667
Hi.

56:21.381 --> 56:22.758
Dude...

56:22.966 --> 56:24.593
...am I ugly?

56:24.968 --> 56:29.389
What? No. No, man,
you're fine. Just relax.

56:29.556 --> 56:31.391
No, I'm ugly. I know it.

56:33.560 --> 56:37.189
-So, what do you guys do?
-I get freaky.

56:39.858 --> 56:42.486
-We're directors.
-Really?

56:42.778 --> 56:45.781
Would you guys ever wanna
use me in one of your movies?

56:47.157 --> 56:48.784
Hell, yeah, we'll use you.

56:48.992 --> 56:52.955
Baby, I'll do things to you
I wouldn't do to a farm animal.

56:53.288 --> 56:56.959
-What the fuck did you just say?
-Honey. These guys are directors.

56:57.167 --> 56:59.878
-And they wanna use me.
-Use you?

57:00.087 --> 57:02.881
Guys, this is my boyfriend,
Mule.

57:05.968 --> 57:07.386
Hi, Mule.

57:11.557 --> 57:12.975
Let's do it.

57:14.059 --> 57:17.354
Man, you gotta use my girl, bro.
She's so good.

57:17.563 --> 57:19.273
I am. I really am.

57:19.773 --> 57:23.068
-You wanna give her a throw?
-Yeah, try me out.

57:23.986 --> 57:26.071
No, you know, no, I'm okay,
though, thank you.

57:26.363 --> 57:28.866
Well, come on.
At least feel her tits.

57:29.992 --> 57:32.286
I'm okay. I can't.
Thank you, though.

57:32.953 --> 57:35.873
Fuck it. I'll feel one.

57:46.967 --> 57:48.468
We're all set for tomorrow.

57:48.552 --> 57:52.472
Athena will be there,
ready to shoot. Right, babe?

57:53.557 --> 57:57.769
Not bad, huh?
Suckers cost me 6 grand.

57:57.978 --> 58:01.481
Yo, Mule, what the hell
are you doing?

58:01.982 --> 58:06.653
Steel, check it out, man.
These guys are directors.

58:06.987 --> 58:08.280
Man, these punks ain't
directors.

58:08.363 --> 58:11.283
They're in high school,
you idiot.

58:13.368 --> 58:15.454
Okay, here's the thing--

58:23.170 --> 58:25.464
Oh, shit!

58:28.383 --> 58:30.177
-Come on, Klitz, come on.
-Get off.

58:39.978 --> 58:41.980
Matty, time to go, time to go.
Time to go.

58:42.189 --> 58:44.274
-What happened?
-It got bad. Bolt. Bolt!

58:44.691 --> 58:46.777
-Dude, wait up.
-Fuck you, dude!

58:54.368 --> 58:55.369
Excuse me.

58:55.452 --> 58:58.664
I just wanna let you know,
I know who you really are.

59:01.291 --> 59:03.961
And you're better than this.

59:41.081 --> 59:42.958
IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY DREAM....

59:44.084 --> 59:46.086
Yeah?

59:53.385 --> 59:54.761
Need a ride to school?

59:59.183 --> 01:00:02.853
It's all you now. I mean,
now you can do whatever you want.

01:00:04.062 --> 01:00:05.856
Why do you believe
in me so much?

01:00:06.773 --> 01:00:08.775
I don't know. Maybe I'm stupid.

01:00:13.572 --> 01:00:17.284
-Good luck tonight.
-Thanks.

01:00:18.285 --> 01:00:20.662
-Bye.
-Bye.

01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:38.055
Will you go to prom with me?

01:00:40.682 --> 01:00:42.184
What?

01:00:47.564 --> 01:00:49.858
I would love to.

01:00:53.278 --> 01:00:56.573
Now for the scientific
explanation. Anybody?

01:00:56.782 --> 01:00:58.575
JOHN F. KENNEDY once said:
ASK NOT....

01:01:00.953 --> 01:01:03.163
That's your speech?

01:01:03.956 --> 01:01:05.666
Yeah.

01:01:06.166 --> 01:01:08.252
You ready for tonight?

01:01:09.461 --> 01:01:11.672
Hey, don't worry, man.
You're gonna be great.

01:01:12.172 --> 01:01:13.966
I have to be.

01:01:26.353 --> 01:01:28.188
That bitch can't just
run away because...

01:01:28.272 --> 01:01:30.065
...she don't wanna fuck
on film anymore.

01:01:30.274 --> 01:01:31.984
May I help you?

01:01:33.861 --> 01:01:36.363
-Get up.
-Okay, okay.

01:01:44.872 --> 01:01:47.082
Stay in school.

01:01:50.752 --> 01:01:53.589
Look, I have the most important
dinner of my life tonight...

01:01:53.755 --> 01:01:55.257
...so wherever we're going,
you know...

01:01:55.382 --> 01:01:57.259
...we just have to be
home by 6.

01:01:57.467 --> 01:01:59.678
Just so you know.

01:02:01.471 --> 01:02:03.891
Here he comes.

01:02:05.893 --> 01:02:08.478
-It's a cool ride, huh?
-Yeah, if you're a fag.

01:02:08.687 --> 01:02:11.773
-Jesus!
-It's cool, it's cool.

01:02:12.357 --> 01:02:13.775
Get in.

01:02:25.954 --> 01:02:28.790
-Where are we going?
-I thought you were cool, man.

01:02:28.957 --> 01:02:31.084
I tried to be your friend,
and what do you do?

01:02:31.251 --> 01:02:32.961
-You fuck me.
-I didn't fuck you.

01:02:33.170 --> 01:02:35.672
She didn't show up on set
because of what you said.

01:02:35.881 --> 01:02:37.382
Now I'm out 30 grand.

01:02:38.759 --> 01:02:42.679
-Guess who's paying me back.
-What? I don't have 30 grand.

01:02:42.888 --> 01:02:45.682
-Get your folks to help.
-They don't have that kind of money.

01:02:45.891 --> 01:02:51.688
Look, Kelly, I'm a problem solver,
all right? This is what I do. Okay?

01:02:51.855 --> 01:02:55.984
Let's just-- Let's just think
outside of the box here.

01:02:56.485 --> 01:02:58.654
Look, she'll get a job,
I'll keep mowing...

01:02:58.779 --> 01:03:01.365
...lawns, and over time
we'll pay it down.

01:03:01.573 --> 01:03:04.284
You know? This can work.
We can do this.

01:03:04.493 --> 01:03:06.870
It'll be like a payment plan.

01:03:14.461 --> 01:03:17.381
-You really care about her, huh?
-Yeah, I really do.

01:03:17.589 --> 01:03:21.093
Yeah, I don't know. If I'm gonna
do this payment-plan thing...

01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:23.554
...I need a show of good faith,
you know?

01:03:23.762 --> 01:03:27.266
-Something concrete.
-Well, like what?

01:03:29.476 --> 01:03:30.769
A blowjob.

01:03:33.063 --> 01:03:35.357
No. I told you she's not gonna
do that anymore.

01:03:36.275 --> 01:03:38.277
Who said anything about her?

01:03:41.989 --> 01:03:45.993
Yeah, we're definitely
outside the box now, huh?

01:03:46.785 --> 01:03:51.290
Now, you gotta ask yourself,
how far are you willing to go?

01:03:53.584 --> 01:03:56.170
How much do you
really care about her?

01:04:01.383 --> 01:04:02.968
I'm joking, man.

01:04:05.679 --> 01:04:06.972
Relax.

01:04:08.682 --> 01:04:11.560
-Damn. Do I look gay to you?
-No, but, Jesus--

01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:20.986
You wanna be president?

01:04:21.069 --> 01:04:23.488
Let me tell you the first
rule of politics:

01:04:23.655 --> 01:04:27.951
Always know if the juice
is worth the squeeze.

01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:31.163
You know what that means?
It means you don't steal my girl...

01:04:31.371 --> 01:04:33.790
...unless you're ready
to accept the consequences.

01:04:39.588 --> 01:04:41.757
All right, I'm sorry, okay?

01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:47.679
That's gonna swell up like
a bitch. Here, take this.

01:04:51.975 --> 01:04:54.353
I'm telling you,
it's gonna hurt like shit.

01:05:00.567 --> 01:05:06.573
I'm sorry I got upset.
I felt taken advantage of.

01:05:07.074 --> 01:05:10.577
Look, I'm not gonna be a dick.
I know she loves you.

01:05:10.869 --> 01:05:13.080
I'm gonna leave you guys alone.

01:05:13.163 --> 01:05:15.374
But now you're doing
something for me.

01:05:25.968 --> 01:05:28.554
Remember that ass-bag, Hugo,
from the convention?

01:05:28.887 --> 01:05:31.056
We used to be partners
a long time ago.

01:05:31.390 --> 01:05:34.268
One day, I had this killer
idea to make films set...

01:05:34.393 --> 01:05:35.269
...in real-life situations.

01:05:35.561 --> 01:05:38.564
You know, Real World porn.

01:05:38.856 --> 01:05:41.775
I told the idea to Hugo.
He says he'll think about it.

01:05:41.984 --> 01:05:43.986
And what does
that motherfucker do?

01:05:44.278 --> 01:05:47.781
Takes my best girl, starts
his own company with my idea...

01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:50.367
...and the guy makes millions.

01:05:50.576 --> 01:05:51.785
It's not the money
that pisses me off.

01:05:51.869 --> 01:05:54.079
I mean, fuck,
it does piss me off...

01:05:54.288 --> 01:05:56.290
...but that's not it.
It's the perception.

01:05:56.456 --> 01:05:59.293
Everybody thinks Hugo's
the genius. It was my idea.

01:05:59.459 --> 01:06:03.255
It's like he's Simon,
and I'm Garfunkel.

01:06:04.089 --> 01:06:08.385
Look at me, man.
I'm fucking Garfunkel.

01:06:11.388 --> 01:06:16.476
-Look, seriously, I can't do this.
-Don't be a pussy. Nobody's home.

01:06:21.481 --> 01:06:24.860
-Why do you want this thing so bad?
-Because it should've been mine.

01:06:25.152 --> 01:06:27.487
-I'll grab it and leave.
-You don't understand...

01:06:27.654 --> 01:06:29.573
...l have to be at
a dinner in an hour.

01:06:29.656 --> 01:06:31.575
My whole life depends on it.

01:06:31.783 --> 01:06:33.452
You want me out
of Danielle's life?

01:06:33.577 --> 01:06:34.870
Yes, I do.

01:06:35.078 --> 01:06:37.581
-Then let's go.
-But wait, seriously.

01:06:37.789 --> 01:06:39.875
Sometimes, if you wanna do
something good...

01:06:40.083 --> 01:06:41.960
...you gotta do
something bad.

01:06:42.085 --> 01:06:44.463
Yeah, but this is breaking
and entering.

01:06:44.671 --> 01:06:47.090
This is politics.

01:06:51.470 --> 01:06:52.888
Hey.

01:06:53.055 --> 01:06:55.891
After this, we're cool, okay?

01:06:58.060 --> 01:07:00.479
You're all right, man.

01:07:28.257 --> 01:07:29.967
Yes.

01:07:30.259 --> 01:07:31.969
I'd like to report a robbery.

01:07:41.353 --> 01:07:43.564
AVN BEST PICTURE 1999
"CHITTY CHITTY GANG BANG"

01:07:43.772 --> 01:07:45.065
HUGO POSH PRODUCER

01:07:46.066 --> 01:07:48.485
Bang me.

01:07:50.487 --> 01:07:52.155
Cradle the balls.

01:08:04.751 --> 01:08:07.379
Stop! Stop! Help me!

01:08:07.588 --> 01:08:10.174
Help! Oh, fuck!

01:08:14.761 --> 01:08:16.470
Wait!

01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:18.055
Come on!

01:08:37.075 --> 01:08:39.077
Okay, so what time
does the dinner start?

01:08:39.286 --> 01:08:40.578
Six o'clock.

01:08:40.787 --> 01:08:43.665
-Why? What time is it now?
-6:30.

01:08:43.957 --> 01:08:46.251
-Oh, my God.
-Dude, don't worry, all right?

01:08:46.460 --> 01:08:48.754
We'll get there.
You know what? Try and--

01:08:48.962 --> 01:08:52.758
-Dude, what are you doing?
-I don't know. I just...

01:08:53.759 --> 01:08:55.676
...feel so good.

01:09:04.478 --> 01:09:06.479
Oh, my God.

01:09:08.064 --> 01:09:10.192
I just feel so weird.

01:09:10.359 --> 01:09:12.653
Don't worry.
Ecstasy is not that bad.

01:09:12.986 --> 01:09:15.863
-What?
-Kelly likes dosing people with E.

01:09:16.990 --> 01:09:19.493
Oh, my God. Am I gonna die?

01:09:19.660 --> 01:09:23.663
No, no, no. It's okay, Matt.
You're gonna be fine. I promise.

01:09:23.956 --> 01:09:27.584
You're such a good friend, Klitzy.
I love you.

01:09:27.876 --> 01:09:29.962
I love you so much.

01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:33.256
This is gonna be amazing.

01:09:34.675 --> 01:09:36.551
Wait a second.

01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:38.679
Oh, my God.

01:09:38.886 --> 01:09:40.889
WELCOME TO THE SHERIDAN
SCHOLARSHIP BANQUET

01:09:43.392 --> 01:09:45.978
You don't understand. It's
really kicking in right now.

01:09:46.185 --> 01:09:48.354
Just try not to talk
so much, okay?

01:09:48.479 --> 01:09:50.357
Talk so much?
I'm giving a speech.

01:09:50.566 --> 01:09:52.693
-It's okay. Just go with it.
-Wait, wait.

01:09:52.859 --> 01:09:53.777
In a few minutes, we'll begin
the speeches, and we hope....

01:10:03.954 --> 01:10:05.664
Thank you again
for coming to what...

01:10:05.789 --> 01:10:08.667
...promises to be a
very eventful evening.

01:10:11.253 --> 01:10:12.880
Matthew Kidman?

01:10:17.176 --> 01:10:18.468
My competition.

01:10:18.677 --> 01:10:21.972
-Hey, what's up, Ryan?
-Jesus, what happened to you?

01:10:22.181 --> 01:10:24.683
Just living life, my man.

01:10:24.892 --> 01:10:26.852
Mina, how are you?

01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:28.979
Okay. Just a little nervous.

01:10:29.188 --> 01:10:31.481
But you're a little temptress,
though, aren't you?

01:10:38.864 --> 01:10:40.574
Hey, buddy. How you doing?

01:10:40.782 --> 01:10:43.785
Hey. Thanks a lot,
thanks a lot.

01:11:07.976 --> 01:11:10.354
Hey, there's the big daddy.

01:11:10.562 --> 01:11:13.190
Matthew, what has been
going on with you?

01:11:13.357 --> 01:11:15.067
Some serious shit.

01:11:15.359 --> 01:11:18.153
But, Jesus, man,
it's good to see you.

01:11:18.487 --> 01:11:20.781
Will you excuse us, please?

01:11:22.491 --> 01:11:23.784
Oh, my God.
Am I blowing it?

01:11:23.992 --> 01:11:25.786
Just try and control yourself.

01:11:25.953 --> 01:11:29.289
-Just breathe, okay?
-All right.

01:11:34.169 --> 01:11:36.672
I have learned a lot
from my teachers.

01:11:37.756 --> 01:11:41.176
But my best teacher
has always been my mother...

01:11:41.385 --> 01:11:44.054
...a woman who worked three
jobs trying to support me...

01:11:44.263 --> 01:11:46.390
...ever since
I was a little niña.

01:11:46.682 --> 01:11:49.560
I will never forget the day
she said to me:

01:11:52.855 --> 01:11:55.566
And that is why I have always
tried to answer the call...

01:11:55.774 --> 01:11:57.484
...of the great
John F. Kennedy...

01:11:57.693 --> 01:12:01.280
...who urged us to
"Ask not what your country"--

01:12:10.873 --> 01:12:12.791
Let's see here....

01:12:12.958 --> 01:12:15.169
I can't speak a
foreign language...

01:12:15.377 --> 01:12:16.670
...so that's out.

01:12:16.962 --> 01:12:20.757
And I-- I certainly
can't quote J.F.K. now...

01:12:20.966 --> 01:12:23.468
...can I, Ryan? You know what?

01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:26.763
It's funny, I have this whole
speech prepared...

01:12:26.972 --> 01:12:29.474
...and I've been
practicing for weeks...

01:12:29.766 --> 01:12:31.560
...but you know what?

01:12:31.768 --> 01:12:33.270
I'm just gonna go with it.

01:12:36.356 --> 01:12:38.984
Moral fiber.

01:12:39.193 --> 01:12:41.778
So, what is moral fiber?
I mean....

01:12:41.987 --> 01:12:45.365
It's funny, I used to think
it was always telling the truth...

01:12:45.574 --> 01:12:47.159
...doing good deeds.

01:12:47.367 --> 01:12:49.786
You know, basically
being a fucking Boy Scout.

01:12:51.663 --> 01:12:53.957
But lately, I've been seeing
it differently.

01:12:55.459 --> 01:12:57.377
Now I think that moral
fiber's about...

01:12:57.586 --> 01:12:59.880
...finding that one thing
you really care about.

01:13:01.089 --> 01:13:02.591
That one special thing
that means more...

01:13:02.674 --> 01:13:05.052
...to you than anything
else in the world.

01:13:06.887 --> 01:13:08.180
And when you find her...

01:13:09.473 --> 01:13:12.684
...you fight for her.
You risk it all.

01:13:13.268 --> 01:13:17.064
...your future, your life...

01:13:13.268 --> 01:13:17.064
You put her in front of
everything...

01:13:17.272 --> 01:13:18.857
...all of it.

01:13:19.775 --> 01:13:23.487
And maybe the stuff you do
to help her isn't so clean.

01:13:24.154 --> 01:13:25.864
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

01:13:28.158 --> 01:13:30.285
Because in your
heart you know...

01:13:31.161 --> 01:13:33.163
...that the juice
is worth the squeeze.

01:13:35.791 --> 01:13:38.085
That's what moral
fiber's all about.

01:14:01.775 --> 01:14:04.570
First, I'd just like to commend
the candidates on...

01:14:04.653 --> 01:14:06.864
...their impressive remarks.

01:14:07.990 --> 01:14:11.159
This year was a
very tough decision.

01:14:11.577 --> 01:14:15.873
And as much as we'd love to give
you all scholarships, we can't.

01:14:16.290 --> 01:14:19.585
And so I am proud to announce
the winner...

01:14:19.751 --> 01:14:21.879
...of this year's
Sheridan scholarship:

01:14:27.259 --> 01:14:29.970
Ryan Winger.

01:15:10.761 --> 01:15:12.554
Oh, God, what happened?

01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:15.390
Yeah, I slipped.

01:15:15.557 --> 01:15:18.185
Listen, Jeannie,
Samnang's coming on Monday.

01:15:18.352 --> 01:15:20.771
-I know. How exciting.
-Yeah.

01:15:20.979 --> 01:15:22.981
So I'm gonna need
to close out the account.

01:15:23.190 --> 01:15:24.775
What do you mean?

01:15:24.983 --> 01:15:27.486
I mean I'm gonna need
to close out the account.

01:15:27.653 --> 01:15:30.489
-But it's already closed.
-What are you talking about?

01:15:30.781 --> 01:15:33.659
Your teacher came by yesterday
and cleared out the account.

01:15:33.867 --> 01:15:35.160
Who? What-- What teacher?

01:15:35.452 --> 01:15:37.079
Your student advisor.
Mr. Salinger.

01:15:37.162 --> 01:15:39.081
The one you were
with the other day.

01:15:39.373 --> 01:15:42.668
Mr. Salinger? What are you--?

01:15:52.553 --> 01:15:54.763
Cambodia

01:15:55.055 --> 01:15:57.558
Samnang, what's wrong, my son?

01:15:57.975 --> 01:16:00.060
That Matthew Kidman.

01:16:00.269 --> 01:16:05.357
He fucked me, Mom.
He fucked me so bad.

01:16:05.566 --> 01:16:07.192
Son of a bitch.

01:16:10.487 --> 01:16:11.780
Oh, my God.

01:16:12.281 --> 01:16:13.866
-What's wrong?
-Jeannie...

01:16:14.867 --> 01:16:16.577
...didn't you ask
for ID or anything?

01:16:17.661 --> 01:16:20.581
You said he was
your student advisor.

01:16:20.664 --> 01:16:21.957
Oh, my God.

01:16:24.293 --> 01:16:26.587
-Jeannie, where are you going?
-To get the manager.

01:16:26.879 --> 01:16:28.380
No, hold on.
Wait, wait, wait.

01:16:29.381 --> 01:16:30.674
Matthew, what's going on?

01:16:31.175 --> 01:16:32.885
Look...

01:16:33.677 --> 01:16:35.762
...that guy wasn't
my student advisor.

01:16:37.055 --> 01:16:40.058
No, I know, I know.
I can get the money back.

01:16:40.267 --> 01:16:43.979
We just need to keep this
between me and you for now, okay?

01:16:44.563 --> 01:16:47.774
That's a great blouse, by the way.
Have you lost weight?

01:16:48.066 --> 01:16:49.860
No? No, wait, wait.

01:16:51.069 --> 01:16:52.279
Jeannie.

01:16:53.864 --> 01:16:56.783
You think about this.
This is your fault too. Right?

01:16:57.075 --> 01:16:59.578
You didn't ask for ID.
You didn't do anything.

01:16:59.786 --> 01:17:01.788
And I saw you flirting
with him too...

01:17:01.872 --> 01:17:02.956
...all right?
So unprofessional.

01:17:03.165 --> 01:17:05.083
You'll lose your job
over this.

01:17:05.167 --> 01:17:06.460
Don't threaten me,
you little shit.

01:17:06.668 --> 01:17:08.587
I could give a fuck about you
and your rice boy.

01:17:08.670 --> 01:17:10.088
I'm not getting fired.

01:17:10.255 --> 01:17:13.175
Okay, okay. I'm sorry.
Just-- Please, I....

01:17:13.383 --> 01:17:15.552
Just-- No one can ever
find out about this.

01:17:15.761 --> 01:17:18.555
If this gets out, I'll be expelled.
My life will be over.

01:17:18.764 --> 01:17:20.557
If that money isn't
back by Monday...

01:17:20.682 --> 01:17:22.684
...I wouldn't worry about
being expelled.

01:17:22.893 --> 01:17:24.478
I'd worry about going to jail.

01:17:26.772 --> 01:17:28.273
-Jeannie....
-Hi, Jeannie.

01:17:28.482 --> 01:17:30.275
Hi, Martin.

01:17:39.952 --> 01:17:41.286
BANK MANAGER

01:17:58.762 --> 01:18:00.764
Matthew, what's wrong?

01:18:01.056 --> 01:18:04.685
Matt, is there something
you want to talk about?

01:18:05.269 --> 01:18:07.980
Matthew, honey, what is it?

01:18:14.862 --> 01:18:17.990
-Hi.
-Come here.

01:18:25.372 --> 01:18:27.583
I'm in so much trouble.

01:18:40.262 --> 01:18:43.390
I can't believe
we're even thinking about this.

01:18:46.351 --> 01:18:49.188
Well, if you need that kind
of money by Monday....

01:18:49.980 --> 01:18:51.481
Yeah-- What are we doing?

01:18:51.565 --> 01:18:53.358
I mean, I can't get you
involved in this.

01:18:53.692 --> 01:18:55.485
I want to do it.

01:18:55.861 --> 01:18:57.487
Why?

01:18:59.489 --> 01:19:01.491
Moral fiber.

01:19:03.577 --> 01:19:04.077
I'm in.

01:19:04.161 --> 01:19:05.954
You haven't heard
the whole plan yet.

01:19:06.163 --> 01:19:07.456
Doesn't matter.

01:19:07.664 --> 01:19:09.583
Fuck film school.

01:19:09.791 --> 01:19:13.378
This is gonna be huge.
This is gonna be my calling card.

01:19:14.963 --> 01:19:16.882
-No.
-Klitzy....

01:19:17.090 --> 01:19:18.884
-No way.
-Klitz...

01:19:19.092 --> 01:19:21.970
...you know I wouldn't ask for
this unless I really needed it.

01:19:22.262 --> 01:19:24.681
Matt believe me,
I want to help you, but-- No.

01:19:24.890 --> 01:19:26.975
-We'll get expelled and--
-Klitz, shut up.

01:19:27.184 --> 01:19:29.478
Do me a favor, okay?

01:19:29.686 --> 01:19:33.190
Take a look at us, okay?
Take a good look at us.

01:19:33.982 --> 01:19:36.276
Do you know what we are,
the three of us?

01:19:39.154 --> 01:19:43.367
-What?
-We're a fucking tripod.

01:19:43.575 --> 01:19:45.786
-A tripod?
-Yeah.

01:19:45.953 --> 01:19:47.788
And you know what that means?

01:19:47.955 --> 01:19:51.667
That means that if you kick out
one of our legs, then we all fall.

01:19:53.752 --> 01:19:55.254
Come on, baby.

01:20:00.175 --> 01:20:01.969
Fuck.

01:20:03.762 --> 01:20:05.681
I know it was you, Klitzy.

01:20:08.767 --> 01:20:11.270
-Where is she?
-Oh, there they are. Hey.

01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:15.274
-Hey!
-Hi, Danielle.

01:20:17.067 --> 01:20:18.986
Hi.

01:20:19.152 --> 01:20:20.988
-Hey, let's get our luggage!
-Yeah.

01:20:21.154 --> 01:20:22.865
-Yeah!
-All right?

01:20:23.282 --> 01:20:25.284
-I'll be there in a minute.
-Okay!

01:20:46.263 --> 01:20:48.974
So if I pull this off,
I get the 25 grand on Sunday?

01:20:49.183 --> 01:20:52.853
Kid, you pull this off I'll
take care of your little Samsung.

01:20:52.978 --> 01:20:54.062
Samnang.

01:20:54.271 --> 01:20:55.564
Whatever.

01:20:55.772 --> 01:20:57.482
Have a nice prom, kid.

01:21:01.069 --> 01:21:04.281
-All right, minions, over here.
-Good luck.

01:21:15.083 --> 01:21:16.877
Relax, relax.

01:21:17.085 --> 01:21:19.087
You know what?
Go wait in the car. Go.

01:21:24.092 --> 01:21:25.677
Jesus.

01:21:28.472 --> 01:21:32.059
Gentlemen, these are your
prom dates, April and Ferrari.

01:21:32.893 --> 01:21:36.980
Ladies, we have Eli and Klitz.

01:21:37.856 --> 01:21:39.358
Your name is Klitz?

01:21:40.359 --> 01:21:41.860
With a K.

01:21:42.152 --> 01:21:46.073
Okay, get a two-shot. Minions.
All right, guys, get closer.

01:21:46.281 --> 01:21:49.868
Yeah, that's right. Show me
the love. Oh, feel it. Feel it!

01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:51.787
-Nice.
-Eli?

01:21:52.079 --> 01:21:54.289
Do those girls go to
your school?

01:21:54.957 --> 01:21:56.458
Actually, no.

01:21:56.792 --> 01:21:58.168
Mrs. Kidman...

01:21:58.377 --> 01:22:02.589
-...they're porn stars.
-Oh, yeah, right.

01:22:17.980 --> 01:22:19.857
You look....

01:22:20.691 --> 01:22:22.192
You-- You look really nice.

01:22:23.068 --> 01:22:24.570
Thanks.

01:22:24.778 --> 01:22:27.155
You really do, hon.
You look so beautiful.

01:22:27.489 --> 01:22:28.782
Really?

01:22:28.991 --> 01:22:30.367
Thanks.

01:22:49.261 --> 01:22:50.888
WELCOME
TO THE SENIOR PROM

01:23:19.166 --> 01:23:20.667
What are all these cameras for?

01:23:21.668 --> 01:23:23.378
For video yearbook.

01:23:47.653 --> 01:23:51.156
So, what should we do?
Should we start setting up?

01:23:51.490 --> 01:23:54.159
Yeah, look, we just gotta
keep this low-key, okay?

01:23:54.368 --> 01:23:55.661
Okay. What are you gonna do?

01:23:57.579 --> 01:23:59.164
I'm gonna get our actors.

01:24:02.292 --> 01:24:05.379
-Dude, make sure they can act.
-Yeah, all right.

01:24:05.587 --> 01:24:08.966
-Just get out of here, okay?
-Hey, I got this taken care of.

01:24:09.174 --> 01:24:12.177
You just show this little lady
a good time tonight, all right?

01:24:12.386 --> 01:24:14.888
-Minions, let's move.
-Wait. So, what are we doing?

01:24:15.055 --> 01:24:16.390
Relax, relax.

01:24:21.353 --> 01:24:23.355
Come on, play it cool,
play it cool.

01:24:38.662 --> 01:24:40.581
Look, they're coming to you.

01:24:41.582 --> 01:24:42.875
I, Matt.

01:24:43.083 --> 01:24:45.085
-What's up?
-What's up?

01:24:45.669 --> 01:24:49.381
-Can we talk to you for a second?
-Dude, I'm with my girl here.

01:24:50.465 --> 01:24:52.467
-Sorry, man.
-Should we come back?

01:24:52.676 --> 01:24:54.970
No, I'll leave you guys alone.

01:25:08.358 --> 01:25:09.067
What's up?

01:25:09.193 --> 01:25:11.069
Hey, man, what's up
with those girls?

01:25:11.361 --> 01:25:14.990
-What about them?
-Are they, like...?

01:25:16.158 --> 01:25:17.492
Are they porn stars?

01:25:18.368 --> 01:25:20.787
-Yeah.
-Shit.

01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:23.790
I knew I recognized them.
I knew it.

01:25:24.958 --> 01:25:26.960
-Can we meet them?
-Yeah.

01:25:30.255 --> 01:25:32.758
How'd you boys
like to be in a movie?

01:25:32.966 --> 01:25:34.760
-What are these?
-Your scripts.

01:25:34.968 --> 01:25:36.762
Sign the release
form at the top.

01:25:36.970 --> 01:25:39.264
Come on, you guys, wait up!

01:25:42.392 --> 01:25:43.560
PHOTO RELEASE

01:25:47.773 --> 01:25:49.066
Are these our actors?

01:25:49.858 --> 01:25:51.860
Just these two.

01:25:52.069 --> 01:25:53.987
What about me, dude?

01:25:54.154 --> 01:25:57.866
Sorry, bro.
Party's all full.

01:25:59.660 --> 01:26:01.161
Gentlemen.

01:26:05.666 --> 01:26:09.461
As an artist, I want it
to come from a truthful place.

01:26:10.379 --> 01:26:13.257
Holy shit.

01:26:16.260 --> 01:26:18.971
-Ferrari. Ferrari. Focus. Listen.
-Oh, okay.

01:26:19.179 --> 01:26:21.265
-Are we...?
-No, I can do this. Don't worry.

01:26:21.473 --> 01:26:23.475
Think Meryl Streep,
Sophie's Choice.

01:26:32.985 --> 01:26:34.278
Hey.

01:26:34.486 --> 01:26:35.988
Hey.

01:26:41.159 --> 01:26:43.662
Next location! Come on, move!

01:26:43.871 --> 01:26:46.456
Move, move, move! Let's go!

01:26:53.255 --> 01:26:55.257
-I gotta be in this.
-Shut up. Take this.

01:27:11.356 --> 01:27:13.358
Oh, come on! Take the pain!

01:27:13.567 --> 01:27:15.068
Take the pain!
Get up. Come on!

01:27:18.864 --> 01:27:20.490
May I have a word with you?

01:27:22.159 --> 01:27:24.661
-What's up?
-I found this in the hallway.

01:27:25.370 --> 01:27:26.663
Do you know what this is?

01:27:27.372 --> 01:27:28.582
No, what is it?

01:27:28.665 --> 01:27:31.084
Looks like a release
form for something.

01:27:32.169 --> 01:27:33.962
Yeah, I don't
know what it is.

01:27:36.256 --> 01:27:38.175
Have a good night.

01:27:56.360 --> 01:27:57.861
You're strong.

01:27:58.070 --> 01:27:59.571
You're firm.

01:27:59.780 --> 01:28:02.074
But you have a secret.

01:28:02.282 --> 01:28:04.284
Show that to me.

01:28:17.756 --> 01:28:19.675
Thank you.

01:28:20.175 --> 01:28:22.052
For what?

01:28:22.469 --> 01:28:24.471
I never went to prom.

01:28:46.368 --> 01:28:48.370
Excuse me, sir?

01:28:48.954 --> 01:28:50.372
We have a problem.

01:28:52.958 --> 01:28:55.252
-What's wrong?
-Derek didn't work out.

01:28:55.669 --> 01:28:57.963
-What happened?
-Let's just say he wasn't strong...

01:28:58.255 --> 01:28:59.965
...or firm.

01:29:00.174 --> 01:29:02.259
Guys, I can't work like this.

01:29:02.593 --> 01:29:04.678
Okay, relax.
We'll just get somebody else.

01:29:04.887 --> 01:29:05.554
There is nobody else.

01:29:05.679 --> 01:29:07.973
I thought everyone's
dying to be in this.

01:29:08.182 --> 01:29:10.392
Not this scene.

01:29:12.769 --> 01:29:14.062
All right.

01:29:14.271 --> 01:29:16.481
This is the key scene.

01:29:16.690 --> 01:29:19.776
If we don't get this,
Hugo's not gonna buy it.

01:29:20.485 --> 01:29:22.988
Yeah, well, somebody's
gotta step up.

01:29:23.155 --> 01:29:26.074
-Why are you looking at me?
-Because you're doing it.

01:29:26.283 --> 01:29:28.577
Whoa, whoa,
Mr. I-Just-Wanna-Bang-Hot-Chicks.

01:29:28.785 --> 01:29:30.954
Here's your first chance.

01:29:31.455 --> 01:29:33.373
Klitz, I can't act
and direct, okay?

01:29:33.582 --> 01:29:34.958
Oh, okay, fine. I'll direct.

01:29:35.167 --> 01:29:36.752
-You're a director now?
-Yeah, I am.

01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:38.879
Okay, Spielberg,
what lens will you use?

01:29:39.087 --> 01:29:40.464
-It's a video camera.
-So?

01:29:40.756 --> 01:29:43.467
Dude, you don't need to change
the lens on a video camera.

01:29:43.675 --> 01:29:46.678
You know what? Take this camera
and shove it up your ass!

01:29:46.887 --> 01:29:48.555
I'll do it.

01:29:51.266 --> 01:29:52.893
I'll do it.

01:29:53.852 --> 01:29:56.188
You guys have been great,
but this is my mess.

01:29:56.355 --> 01:29:58.273
-I'll clean it up.
-Matt. Matt.

01:29:58.482 --> 01:30:00.984
Your face is gonna be in this.
Think about that.

01:30:33.767 --> 01:30:36.687
-Come here, baby.
-Let's....

01:30:37.563 --> 01:30:39.356
Picture's up, people.

01:30:52.160 --> 01:30:53.579
Are you ready, hon?

01:30:53.787 --> 01:30:55.080
Yeah.

01:30:55.289 --> 01:30:57.082
Okay, let's do this.

01:31:05.382 --> 01:31:07.176
And...

01:31:07.467 --> 01:31:08.886
...action.

01:31:12.764 --> 01:31:14.975
What the hell
is going on in here?

01:31:18.353 --> 01:31:20.355
-Nobody move!
-Oh, shit.

01:31:20.564 --> 01:31:22.357
Who is in charge of this?

01:31:23.984 --> 01:31:25.777
I asked you people
a question!

01:31:25.986 --> 01:31:27.988
Who is in charge here?

01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:43.462
Fuck it.

01:32:13.992 --> 01:32:16.662
All right, everybody,
take five.

01:32:17.788 --> 01:32:19.081
What's wrong?

01:32:19.289 --> 01:32:20.958
I can't do this.

01:32:21.166 --> 01:32:22.793
What happened?

01:32:34.763 --> 01:32:36.890
What are you gonna do?

01:32:39.393 --> 01:32:41.478
I don't know.
Doesn't matter.

01:32:45.566 --> 01:32:47.484
No.

01:32:47.693 --> 01:32:49.361
I'll do it.

01:32:49.987 --> 01:32:51.655
Klitz, it's cool.
You don't have to-

01:32:51.780 --> 01:32:53.156
No, no, I'm doing it.

01:32:54.283 --> 01:32:55.868
Why?

01:32:56.660 --> 01:32:58.787
Because we're
a fucking tripod.

01:33:00.163 --> 01:33:03.166
All right, here we go, people.
Picture's up.

01:33:04.585 --> 01:33:07.588
Listen, I know this
is unprofessional...

01:33:07.754 --> 01:33:09.882
...but I think
you're really cute.

01:33:10.090 --> 01:33:11.675
Yeah, right.

01:33:12.676 --> 01:33:14.678
I'm serious.

01:33:15.470 --> 01:33:16.972
Really cute.

01:33:17.764 --> 01:33:19.057
How we doing, Klitzy?

01:33:20.893 --> 01:33:22.352
Fucking great, man.

01:33:22.561 --> 01:33:23.854
Let's do this.

01:33:24.271 --> 01:33:26.356
And action!

01:34:17.157 --> 01:34:18.784
See you guys.

01:34:21.161 --> 01:34:23.163
Good night, guys.

01:34:28.377 --> 01:34:29.878
So...

01:34:30.087 --> 01:34:32.673
...what's the craziest thing
you've done lately?

01:35:48.373 --> 01:35:50.375
-Hello?
-We're dead.

01:35:50.584 --> 01:35:52.878
-Eli?
-Dude, the tape's not here.

01:35:53.086 --> 01:35:54.379
-I can't find it.
-What?

01:35:54.588 --> 01:35:57.758
Dude, I'm not kidding, okay?
I've looked everywhere, okay?

01:35:58.091 --> 01:35:58.884
All right,
calm down.

01:35:58.967 --> 01:36:00.886
No, dude, you calm down!
It's gone!

01:36:01.053 --> 01:36:03.764
-What do you mean it's gone?
-I mean it's freaking gone.

01:36:04.264 --> 01:36:06.058
Somebody stole it!

01:36:06.266 --> 01:36:07.559
Jesus Christ!

01:36:07.684 --> 01:36:09.186
Matthew, could you
come in here?

01:36:14.983 --> 01:36:17.069
This is Mr. Simon.

01:36:19.071 --> 01:36:22.157
He says he has something
very important to discuss with us.

01:36:26.370 --> 01:36:27.663
Why don't you sit down.

01:36:31.375 --> 01:36:33.585
Actually, if you don't mind...

01:36:33.752 --> 01:36:36.088
...may I have a word
with the boy alone first?

01:36:37.673 --> 01:36:39.258
Sure.

01:36:48.267 --> 01:36:49.476
So how was prom?

01:36:52.479 --> 01:36:54.273
-That's mine.
-You know, we were fine.

01:36:54.481 --> 01:36:57.568
But now you go and do this?
This was my idea.

01:36:57.776 --> 01:36:59.570
Now I'm really gonna
fuck your shit up.

01:37:00.654 --> 01:37:02.281
I'm gonna need that back.

01:37:05.993 --> 01:37:07.369
Take it from me.

01:37:10.956 --> 01:37:12.875
Yeah...

01:37:13.083 --> 01:37:15.085
...what are you gonna do?

01:37:17.087 --> 01:37:18.463
I don't have to do anything.

01:37:19.173 --> 01:37:20.966
Hugo Posh will.

01:37:21.175 --> 01:37:24.052
Yeah, he's my partner
on this, 50-50.

01:37:25.053 --> 01:37:27.556
So could I please
have my tape back?

01:37:27.764 --> 01:37:29.558
Fuck you!

01:37:30.684 --> 01:37:33.187
Fuck you.
I'm taking your half then.

01:37:33.353 --> 01:37:36.982
No. That money's going to Samnang.
The money you stole from him.

01:37:37.191 --> 01:37:40.569
You say that like I care.
I don't give a shit.

01:37:40.777 --> 01:37:42.571
You're giving me your half.

01:37:43.071 --> 01:37:45.157
And if I don't?

01:37:45.866 --> 01:37:47.159
Showtime.

01:37:53.665 --> 01:37:56.251
-Okay.
-"Okay," what?

01:37:57.878 --> 01:37:59.671
Show them the tape.

01:37:59.963 --> 01:38:01.673
I'm not fucking around.

01:38:03.258 --> 01:38:05.260
I just don't care anymore.

01:38:07.179 --> 01:38:08.680
This...

01:38:08.889 --> 01:38:11.475
...is gonna be interesting.

01:38:15.354 --> 01:38:17.856
Dan, Marci, Mr. Salinger...

01:38:18.065 --> 01:38:21.193
...would you mind joining me
in the living room for a second?

01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:22.861
Great.

01:38:30.285 --> 01:38:33.872
Matthew, is there anything you want
to say before we watch this?

01:38:37.793 --> 01:38:39.878
Okay, then. On with the show.

01:38:43.382 --> 01:38:45.467
Hello. I'm April.

01:38:45.676 --> 01:38:47.261
And I'm Ferrari.

01:38:47.469 --> 01:38:51.056
You may recognize us as stars of
the adult entertainment industry.

01:38:51.390 --> 01:38:53.559
And today we're taking time
out to talk about...

01:38:53.684 --> 01:38:55.352
...a very important subject.

01:38:55.561 --> 01:38:57.062
-Sex.
-Sex.

01:38:58.272 --> 01:39:00.566
Special events
such as senior prom...

01:39:00.774 --> 01:39:01.859
...place added pressure
on young teens...

01:39:02.067 --> 01:39:05.070
...to lose their virginity
and engage in unprotected sex.

01:39:05.279 --> 01:39:07.656
I know I lost my virginity
at my senior...

01:39:07.781 --> 01:39:09.658
...prom. When'd you
lose yours, April?

01:39:09.867 --> 01:39:12.870
-When I was 10.
-Moving on.

01:39:13.078 --> 01:39:15.581
In this video,
we'll go through.

01:39:15.664 --> 01:39:17.165
...everything from kissing
to foreplay.

01:39:17.374 --> 01:39:21.170
And for our finale, we'll show you
how to put a condom on properly...

01:39:21.378 --> 01:39:23.589
...using a real person.

01:39:23.672 --> 01:39:26.258
No cucumbers or bananas
in this video.

01:39:26.466 --> 01:39:28.552
So for those of you
naughty boys...

01:39:28.677 --> 01:39:30.387
...expecting to see a
raunchy porn video...

01:39:30.762 --> 01:39:33.891
...you might as well
turn this off now...

01:39:34.057 --> 01:39:35.767
...because you're not
gonna see sex.

01:39:35.976 --> 01:39:37.477
What the fuck is this shit?

01:39:37.686 --> 01:39:40.480
You're gonna see sex education.

01:39:42.691 --> 01:39:44.276
The ELI EXPERIENCE
presents

01:39:45.652 --> 01:39:48.864
ADULT EDUCATION
Sex Education for the 21st Century

01:39:51.992 --> 01:39:53.952
This is interesting, Matthew.

01:39:57.456 --> 01:39:58.790
Yeah.

01:39:58.957 --> 01:40:01.376
Yeah, I think it's
a great idea.

01:40:04.755 --> 01:40:08.091
Well, you remember those
sex-ed films back in our day.

01:40:08.675 --> 01:40:11.970
Well, I'll tell you, if
they were anything like this...

01:40:12.179 --> 01:40:15.265
...we sure would've paid
more attention, don't you think?

01:40:16.975 --> 01:40:19.186
I think it's atrocious.

01:40:22.189 --> 01:40:23.482
But...

01:40:23.690 --> 01:40:25.484
...the hell with it.

01:40:26.777 --> 01:40:29.071
The kids today
are so goddamn screwed up...

01:40:29.279 --> 01:40:32.282
...maybe this is the only way
you can reach them.

01:40:35.285 --> 01:40:37.579
You just might
have something here, Matthew.

01:40:38.163 --> 01:40:39.957
I think it's pretty wild.

01:40:41.166 --> 01:40:43.168
This could really sell,
don't you think?

01:40:44.586 --> 01:40:46.755
How'd you come up
with such an idea, Matthew?

01:40:48.257 --> 01:40:49.591
What can I say?

01:40:50.968 --> 01:40:53.053
It's like a gift, you know?

01:40:53.971 --> 01:40:56.056
It's like I can't control it.

01:41:00.060 --> 01:41:01.353
We've Only.
Just Begun.

01:41:04.773 --> 01:41:06.066
YEARBOOKS
TODAY!

01:41:06.275 --> 01:41:09.862
Courtney Booth. I will always
remember late nights in Cabby--

01:41:10.070 --> 01:41:11.864
Eric Zierdal.
I'll always remember--

01:41:12.072 --> 01:41:13.365
Kurt Kilgore. I will--

01:41:13.574 --> 01:41:14.575
Joseph Croft.

01:41:14.783 --> 01:41:17.369
I will always remember wrestling
and the great memories we had.

01:41:17.578 --> 01:41:20.664
Matthew Kidman.
I will always remember...

01:41:23.166 --> 01:41:25.669
...the three legs of
the tripod.

01:41:26.086 --> 01:41:29.464
I'm here with Hugo Posh,
the producer of Adult Education...

01:41:29.673 --> 01:41:32.968
...the hottest-selling
sex-education video ever made...

01:41:33.177 --> 01:41:35.971
...being utilized in classrooms
across the globe.

01:41:36.180 --> 01:41:40.475
Hugo, you're known primarily as
a hard-core pornographer, correct?

01:41:40.684 --> 01:41:41.977
My business partner.

01:41:42.186 --> 01:41:43.562
Let me break it down for you

01:41:43.770 --> 01:41:46.857
See, Hugo Posh isn't just tits.
He isn't just ass.

01:41:47.983 --> 01:41:51.862
I mean, yes, he is those things,
but Hugo Posh is also heart.

01:41:52.487 --> 01:41:54.281
What an ass-bag.

01:41:54.990 --> 01:41:56.491
THE JUICE WAS
WORTH THE SQUEEZE

01:41:56.992 --> 01:41:59.077
Fucking kid.

01:41:59.286 --> 01:42:01.079
My student advisor.

01:42:01.288 --> 01:42:03.290
All right, people.

01:42:03.790 --> 01:42:05.292
Let's make some fucky-fucky.

01:42:05.459 --> 01:42:08.253
Now, Hugo, you and your partner
have made millions on this.

01:42:08.462 --> 01:42:10.172
So who is this silent partner?

01:42:11.590 --> 01:42:14.551
Well, he prefers to remain
anonymous.

01:42:22.184 --> 01:42:25.187
You better cure cancer, kid.

01:42:25.354 --> 01:42:26.980
The next Einstein.

01:42:27.356 --> 01:42:29.274
All right.
Yeah, next question.

01:42:30.359 --> 01:42:32.486
-All right.
-Eli's calling card.

01:42:32.653 --> 01:42:34.780
-How about you, buddy?
-Yeah, Mr. Brooks...

01:42:34.988 --> 01:42:37.074
...why did you decide
to skip film school?

01:42:37.282 --> 01:42:39.159
Don't you think you're
a little young?

01:42:39.284 --> 01:42:40.577
Shut the fuck up!

01:42:40.786 --> 01:42:42.287
Next question! Faster!

01:42:42.454 --> 01:42:44.873
I got the tape! Can you see?
I got the tape!

01:42:46.959 --> 01:42:48.877
For our finale,
I will now demonstrate...

01:42:48.961 --> 01:42:49.878
...the proper technique...

01:42:50.087 --> 01:42:51.672
...for putting a condom
on the real thing.

01:42:51.755 --> 01:42:53.590
Is my volunteer ready?

01:42:53.757 --> 01:42:55.592
Klitz's big debut.

01:42:55.884 --> 01:42:57.761
Shut up, shut up!
Here he is, here he is.

01:43:05.352 --> 01:43:08.063
Jesus, look at that guy.

01:43:08.856 --> 01:43:11.692
He is huge.

01:43:16.363 --> 01:43:19.658
My own scholarship
to Georgetown.

01:43:24.371 --> 01:43:26.957
And of course,
I'll never forget...

01:43:27.165 --> 01:43:28.458
...the girl next door.

01:43:36.466 --> 01:43:38.552
As for me...

01:43:39.386 --> 01:43:41.763
...I'm just going with it.
