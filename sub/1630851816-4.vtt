WEBVTT

00:44.461 --> 00:47.380
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

00:59.392 --> 01:00.477
Mom.

01:02.562 --> 01:03.396
Mom!

01:07.025 --> 01:08.234
Mom!

01:08.318 --> 01:09.736
Is anybody there?

01:19.871 --> 01:21.414
Are you okay?

01:21.998 --> 01:22.957
What?

01:25.126 --> 01:29.088
Mom, I was calling you.
Why didn't you answer me?

01:29.172 --> 01:31.216
What are you talking about?
You were asleep.

01:36.012 --> 01:38.223
I must be very sick, Mom.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.767
I just had a nightmare. It was so vivid.

01:41.601 --> 01:42.769
You did?

01:45.647 --> 01:48.066
Your friends came by.
Should I tell them to go?

01:48.149 --> 01:49.609
Who came?

01:53.571 --> 01:55.115
Are you dating Yong-tak?

01:55.615 --> 01:56.825
He hasn't said anything.

01:58.701 --> 01:59.911
So you two are dating.

02:00.787 --> 02:03.540
It's not official until he asks me out.

02:05.667 --> 02:07.377
I'll leave the notes I took here.

02:09.796 --> 02:11.047
I envy you two.

02:12.632 --> 02:14.968
But why is he eating ice cream
in the morning?

02:15.635 --> 02:16.469
Isn't it too cold?

02:16.553 --> 02:18.888
It wakes him up.
He didn't sleep well last night.

02:21.808 --> 02:24.269
-He didn't sleep well?
-Yes.

02:24.853 --> 02:26.729
He says he's been having strange dreams.

02:30.233 --> 02:33.194
I heard that Yong-tak was having
the same recurring dream.

02:34.028 --> 02:36.990
I still remember it even after ten years.

02:38.825 --> 02:39.993
Really?

02:40.869 --> 02:42.620
Why can't I remember anything?

02:45.582 --> 02:46.749
Jung-hyun.

02:47.709 --> 02:50.753
Do you know why I remember
that morning so clearly?

02:51.504 --> 02:54.883
Because a few days later,
the terrorist attack occurred.

02:54.966 --> 02:56.467
During the Chuseok holidays…

02:56.551 --> 02:58.094
After the attack,

02:58.678 --> 03:00.638
you didn't come to school again.

03:02.265 --> 03:04.684
Yes, I didn't.

03:05.351 --> 03:07.770
After you stopped coming to school
due to the terrorist attack,

03:08.813 --> 03:10.356
<i>the school magazine club was disbanded.</i>

03:11.107 --> 03:14.068
<i>And we hardly talked
to one another in school.</i>

03:14.903 --> 03:16.613
That's how we graduated.

03:45.225 --> 03:47.477
Do you know the herbicide, Gramoxone?

03:50.021 --> 03:52.649
It's cheap and effective.

03:54.067 --> 03:56.194
So lots of farmers used it to kill weeds.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.613
But Gramoxone is also

04:01.282 --> 04:03.409
called the Blue Devil.

04:04.077 --> 04:06.412
The minute you ingest it,

04:07.705 --> 04:10.124
it will damage your tongue,
esophagus, and lungs.

04:11.459 --> 04:13.127
It'll burn everything in its path.

04:13.962 --> 04:16.673
The pain is akin to being burned alive.

04:16.756 --> 04:18.549
And it feels like your flesh is melting.

04:20.468 --> 04:23.429
You'll experience hellish pain.

04:25.848 --> 04:26.849
I see.

04:27.809 --> 04:29.143
A few years ago,

04:30.770 --> 04:34.482
a 12-year old girl poured Gramoxone
into her dad's <i>makgeolli </i>drink

04:35.191 --> 04:37.277
and killed him.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.653
What's worse is the fact

04:39.779 --> 04:42.532
she took a video of her dad dying.

04:43.199 --> 04:44.617
We found the tape.

04:45.827 --> 04:47.537
<i>So I asked the girl</i>

04:49.789 --> 04:51.624
<i>why she did it.</i>

04:52.542 --> 04:54.919
<i>I told her I wasn't asking her
why she killed him.</i>

04:55.003 --> 04:57.046
<i>I wanted to know
why she videotaped her dad</i>

04:58.381 --> 05:00.383
<i>as he was dying.</i>

05:01.926 --> 05:03.636
<i>What she told me</i>

05:05.096 --> 05:07.598
<i>stayed with me for quite a while.</i>

05:08.182 --> 05:09.517
What did she say?

05:10.601 --> 05:11.894
She did it to not forget.

05:15.648 --> 05:17.942
She didn't want to forget

05:19.110 --> 05:20.486
how much she hated her dad.

05:22.947 --> 05:25.450
So to prevent herself
from forgiving her dad over time,

05:27.118 --> 05:29.245
she made that videotape.

05:30.955 --> 05:32.332
That's what she said.

05:40.298 --> 05:42.884
I think about what she said
from time to time.

05:46.512 --> 05:50.641
I constantly try to get rid of memories
about disturbing cases I've worked on.

05:54.520 --> 05:56.564
But she was doing the opposite.

05:58.566 --> 05:59.776
If I may,

06:00.860 --> 06:03.196
can I ask you if what happened that day

06:04.489 --> 06:07.992
is also one of your disturbing memories?

06:11.329 --> 06:14.082
I heard that there was an accident.

06:51.452 --> 06:53.162
Team One. What's the status?

06:54.413 --> 06:55.623
<i>The hallway on the first floor is clear.</i>

06:55.706 --> 06:57.291
<i>We have confirmed
the presence of individuals.</i>

07:01.337 --> 07:03.047
Team One. What is the status?

07:03.131 --> 07:05.550
Team Two.
We're going in to provide support.

07:33.077 --> 07:35.371
-Stop!
-Don't move!

07:38.332 --> 07:39.292
Die!

07:44.172 --> 07:45.673
<i>Head to the second floor.</i>

09:42.832 --> 09:45.501
-What the hell?
-What is it?

09:45.585 --> 09:48.212
Don't be afraid. We're the police.

09:48.296 --> 09:51.007
Are you being held here against your will?

09:51.507 --> 09:52.925
Who did you say you are?

09:53.009 --> 09:54.135
We're the police.

09:55.303 --> 09:58.931
But this door is too thick to break open.
We'll need a key to open it.

09:59.557 --> 10:00.933
No, we can't.

10:01.017 --> 10:02.602
What? You can't do what?

10:02.685 --> 10:04.061
It's too noisy outside.

10:06.022 --> 10:08.149
They might be listening to everything.

10:12.695 --> 10:14.405
Detective Lee, check that area.

10:14.488 --> 10:16.282
-Okay.
-Be careful.

10:18.909 --> 10:20.202
Damn it.

10:20.828 --> 10:22.204
Hang in there for a minute.

10:26.751 --> 10:27.877
What is this?

10:28.919 --> 10:30.004
This way.

10:45.728 --> 10:48.981
-Hey, drop your weapon.
-Hey, you punk.

10:49.065 --> 10:51.275
It's over. Drop your weapon.

10:51.359 --> 10:54.070
I told you to drop your weapon.
You crazy bastard!

10:54.153 --> 10:55.404
Detective Lee, stay calm.

11:01.952 --> 11:03.079
Drop the gun.

11:03.162 --> 11:06.290
-Do you see it?
-Hey! Drop the gun.

11:08.209 --> 11:09.919
-You can't see it?
-You piece of shit!

11:10.002 --> 11:12.713
-Don't play games with us!
-Detective Lee, stay still.

11:13.923 --> 11:15.800
What are you talking about? Talk to us.

11:16.467 --> 11:18.177
That woman over there.

11:19.970 --> 11:21.389
You don't see her?

11:23.140 --> 11:24.100
Damn it.

11:24.183 --> 11:26.769
No, I don't see anyone.
Who are you talking about?

11:28.104 --> 11:29.397
So that's it.

11:31.232 --> 11:34.193
-That's what Guru has been telling us.
-Guru?

11:34.276 --> 11:36.362
-Hey! Wait!
-I'm sorry, Dear.

11:44.620 --> 11:45.788
Detective Lee.

11:47.123 --> 11:48.666
Check that area.

11:48.749 --> 11:51.544
Stay focused.
And don't let your guard down.

11:51.627 --> 11:52.878
Okay.

12:08.727 --> 12:09.895
Detective Lee.

12:11.230 --> 12:13.983
Take the keys.
Go back to those people we saw.

12:15.901 --> 12:17.736
-Stay calm.
-Okay.

13:01.155 --> 13:02.448
Damn it.

13:05.784 --> 13:07.703
I see you're all ready to leave.

13:07.786 --> 13:08.996
Please be patient.

13:10.789 --> 13:11.874
I unlocked it.

14:08.097 --> 14:10.975
CROCODILE SNACK SHOP

14:16.105 --> 14:17.147
What is that?

14:17.731 --> 14:18.857
It's a <i>Tamagotchi</i>.

14:21.944 --> 14:23.445
Check if I memorized it all.

14:27.616 --> 14:31.954
Detective Choi, I did not intend
to hide any evidence.

14:32.705 --> 14:37.543
My friend, Jo Jae-young,
asked me not to tell anyone

14:38.210 --> 14:41.463
about the tape.
So that's why I didn't mention it.

14:41.547 --> 14:46.093
But since Jae-young is still missing,

14:47.052 --> 14:48.929
I'm very worried about her.

14:49.013 --> 14:52.099
That's why I think giving you the tape

14:52.182 --> 14:53.350
that Jae-young lent to me

14:54.268 --> 14:57.646
-is the right thing to do--
-Can't you speak naturally?

14:57.730 --> 14:59.899
-You sound like a robot.
-It's too long.

14:59.982 --> 15:01.400
You interrupted me.

15:02.151 --> 15:04.320
-What comes next?
-I hope you'll forgive me.

15:05.195 --> 15:07.114
I hope you'll forgive me.

15:08.490 --> 15:12.411
Hey, people are asking for refunds
for the mixtape we made this time.

15:12.494 --> 15:14.121
We're going to lose money.

15:15.039 --> 15:17.416
I heard that everyone at school
thinks we're losers.

15:17.499 --> 15:19.335
Hey, that's nothing.

15:19.418 --> 15:21.503
My mom won't even fix me any meals.

15:21.587 --> 15:25.049
I need to be loved to grow up
into a healthy person.

15:28.093 --> 15:31.013
When Jae-young returns,
let's make her pay for this.

15:31.096 --> 15:33.390
Right. We're going through this
because of her.

15:33.474 --> 15:36.268
I think she should be the one
who goes to buy instant noodles for us

15:36.352 --> 15:37.770
at the snack shop for a year.

15:37.853 --> 15:39.396
-Yes.
-I totally agree.

15:39.480 --> 15:40.564
That's right.

15:41.231 --> 15:43.025
-Hurry up and memorize it.
-Let me have it.

15:44.610 --> 15:45.778
Detective Choi…

16:00.417 --> 16:01.335
Hello.

16:03.003 --> 16:05.798
We came to see Detective Choi Hyung-in.

16:05.881 --> 16:06.882
Why do you need to see him?

16:06.966 --> 16:10.803
We're in the broadcasting club
at Gyeongcheon Girls' Middle School.

16:11.720 --> 16:14.473
We have something
to give to the detective.

16:14.556 --> 16:17.768
He is busy at the moment.
I'll give it to him so leave it with me.

16:23.691 --> 16:25.859
-What is this?
-It's a cassette tape.

16:28.070 --> 16:29.780
But there's something

16:29.863 --> 16:33.117
I also need to tell Detective Choi.

16:33.200 --> 16:34.827
Go ahead and say it. I'll write a note.

16:37.788 --> 16:39.289
It won't be necessary. It's okay.

16:40.874 --> 16:43.127
That's all you need, right?
I'll just give this to him. Okay?

16:44.169 --> 16:45.462
Okay.

17:02.062 --> 17:03.105
Take the medicine.

17:22.875 --> 17:25.252
I don't think your dog
will live that much longer.

17:28.130 --> 17:30.215
He's around 15 years old, I think.

17:32.217 --> 17:33.719
I feel sorry for him.

17:35.929 --> 17:39.016
If my wife were alive,
he would have had a fun life.

17:40.934 --> 17:43.062
Living with an owner like me isn't fun.

17:51.487 --> 17:53.155
You quit drinking, didn't you?

17:57.451 --> 17:58.994
After taking a sip,

17:59.828 --> 18:03.332
I remember why I tried so hard
to quit drinking.

18:04.500 --> 18:05.626
What was the reason?

18:07.419 --> 18:09.213
I can forget things for a while

18:09.880 --> 18:11.757
when I drink.

18:12.716 --> 18:14.510
But when I get sober the next day,

18:16.095 --> 18:18.847
I'm saddled with guilt.

18:19.598 --> 18:21.225
Then I go back to having a drink.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.478
You know what?

18:25.270 --> 18:27.648
It's similar to
how a low-life gambler who owes money

18:28.857 --> 18:31.318
turns to loan sharks to borrow more.

18:38.492 --> 18:39.868
Hyung-in.

18:41.745 --> 18:43.413
Don't blame yourself for it.

18:44.665 --> 18:46.333
It wasn't your fault.

18:55.926 --> 18:57.177
Hold on a minute.

19:12.568 --> 19:13.944
Let's go.

19:16.155 --> 19:17.281
Now.

19:19.199 --> 19:20.826
Get off first, Chief.

19:23.662 --> 19:24.746
Why aren't you getting out?

19:25.789 --> 19:29.001
It's because you're taking your time.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.264
You can have it if you want.

19:43.599 --> 19:44.808
Isn't this expensive?

19:44.892 --> 19:47.186
I don't know.
I have a bunch of them at home.

19:59.907 --> 20:01.491
Oh, Chief.

20:32.898 --> 20:35.901
I didn't expect
to see you here, Detective Choi.

20:35.984 --> 20:38.570
I was told you were partners.

20:40.405 --> 20:41.573
Yes.

20:42.866 --> 20:45.244
You're friends with Detective Lee's wife?

20:45.327 --> 20:47.704
Yes. She's an old high school friend.

20:47.788 --> 20:49.164
I see.

20:53.919 --> 20:57.756
You must feel bad about
what happened to your partner.

21:00.884 --> 21:03.095
My feelings are of no significance.

21:03.178 --> 21:05.472
My partner is probably
going through a lot.

21:10.686 --> 21:12.145
I need to go.

21:12.229 --> 21:14.273
I just came to see how he was doing.

21:14.356 --> 21:17.401
Oh, I'm sorry for taking up your time.

21:17.484 --> 21:18.485
That's all right.

21:18.568 --> 21:19.569
Whenever I see you,

21:20.195 --> 21:21.530
I have

21:22.281 --> 21:24.116
so many questions to ask.

21:25.409 --> 21:26.493
I know

21:27.828 --> 21:29.621
you're busy working on the case.

21:33.500 --> 21:34.459
Ms. Jo,

21:35.502 --> 21:37.796
a special investigation unit

21:38.547 --> 21:40.299
has been assigned to this case.

21:40.882 --> 21:44.761
They'll probably investigate
your niece's disappearance as well.

21:45.470 --> 21:47.097
What are you talking about?

21:47.848 --> 21:50.934
-A new team will take over the case?
-Yes.

21:51.018 --> 21:53.770
Not right now, but it'll happen soon.

21:53.854 --> 21:55.439
What about you, Detective Choi?

21:55.522 --> 21:57.566
You'll be joining the new team, won't you?

22:04.573 --> 22:05.782
This doesn't make sense.

22:06.992 --> 22:08.368
It looks like

22:08.994 --> 22:11.121
the police are dropping the case entirely.

22:12.080 --> 22:13.123
No.

22:13.832 --> 22:16.793
A more experienced team than us
will take over the investigation.

22:42.402 --> 22:43.528
Ms. Jo Jung-hyun.

22:45.697 --> 22:48.158
I don't know
if it's okay for me to tell you this,

22:48.950 --> 22:52.162
bu on October 6, 1987,
one day before Chuseok,

22:53.413 --> 22:55.040
I lost my wife.

22:57.501 --> 22:59.669
She was a victim of
Jo Kyung-ho's terrorist attack.

23:03.048 --> 23:06.134
Searching for Jo Kyung-ho's daughter

23:07.135 --> 23:09.471
and talking with
that bastard's family members

23:10.597 --> 23:12.474
feels like a form of punishment.

23:12.557 --> 23:14.309
Of course, you had no part of it.

23:15.769 --> 23:17.646
And that's also the case with your niece.

23:18.480 --> 23:20.440
But it's hard for me
not to feel any anger.

23:21.650 --> 23:23.068
No matter how hard I try.

23:27.447 --> 23:30.033
I realize how I feel about this case

23:30.117 --> 23:32.953
after my partner got severely injured.

23:33.036 --> 23:34.204
It's clear to me now.

23:34.287 --> 23:35.580
I'm

23:36.665 --> 23:38.834
not a saint
who doesn't harbor any ill will

23:38.917 --> 23:41.044
towards you and your family.

23:41.128 --> 23:45.298
So that disqualifies me
from handling this case anymore.

23:51.263 --> 23:52.556
I'm so sorry.

23:54.933 --> 23:56.393
I'm very sorry.

23:57.185 --> 23:58.436
I'm sorry.

23:58.520 --> 23:59.521
No.

24:00.814 --> 24:03.483
I don't feel any compassion

24:05.068 --> 24:06.903
for your pain and anguish.

24:07.904 --> 24:09.030
So it's better

24:09.865 --> 24:12.033
for someone else to take over this case.

24:14.077 --> 24:15.245
Please…

24:18.165 --> 24:20.792
don't stop looking for my niece.

24:23.712 --> 24:24.838
I refuse.

24:26.673 --> 24:30.010
I hate looking at you and your family

24:31.469 --> 24:32.888
crying in front of me.

24:35.515 --> 24:36.850
That's who I am.

24:40.478 --> 24:41.730
I'm sorry.

25:03.877 --> 25:05.378
Oh, what now?

25:16.932 --> 25:18.141
What is it, Chief?

25:19.267 --> 25:20.644
You'll be able to return to the force.

25:22.896 --> 25:26.149
Chief, speak slower. I can't understand.

25:27.025 --> 25:29.277
Or you can write it down.

25:40.080 --> 25:42.874
You'll be able to return to the force.
Don't worry.

25:44.501 --> 25:45.877
I don't understand what that means,

25:46.628 --> 25:48.004
but it's good news, right?

25:49.005 --> 25:50.298
I know that.

26:15.699 --> 26:16.950
Hello?

26:17.033 --> 26:18.410
<i>Do you know what time it is?</i>

26:18.493 --> 26:20.161
I don't know. What time is it?

26:20.245 --> 26:22.497
<i>It's only 9 p.m.</i>

26:23.081 --> 26:25.041
Why did you call? You're so annoying.

26:25.542 --> 26:27.502
<i>Hurry up
and turn on the instant messenger.</i>

26:28.003 --> 26:29.421
I'm too tired.

26:29.504 --> 26:32.173
<i>Hurry up and open it. It's urgent.</i>

26:33.216 --> 26:34.592
Oh gosh.

26:42.142 --> 26:43.727
I logged on. What now?

26:43.810 --> 26:45.437
-<i>Don't you see it?</i>
-See what?

26:45.520 --> 26:47.230
<i>Jae-young has logged on.</i>

26:47.314 --> 26:49.649
<i>-Take a look.</i>
-What?

26:49.733 --> 26:52.193
JAE-YOUNG: ONLINE

26:54.779 --> 26:57.032
-You're right.
<i>-I told you so.</i>

26:57.115 --> 27:00.618
-Did you send her a message?
<i>-Yes, but she hasn't answered back.</i>

27:03.163 --> 27:05.457
<i>Jae-young, where are you?</i>

27:05.540 --> 27:06.833
<i>Are you okay?</i>

27:09.502 --> 27:11.004
<i>She's not answering, right?</i>

27:13.423 --> 27:14.632
No.

27:15.550 --> 27:18.511
<i>You'll find it
in the 1987 school magazine.</i>

27:23.516 --> 27:25.685

27:38.907 --> 27:41.451

27:50.293 --> 27:54.839
MISSING CASE OF JAE-YOUNG
SUSPECT HAS CONFESSED

28:05.141 --> 28:06.768
-Chief.
-Oh, you came.

28:06.851 --> 28:08.895
-Sorry for the late-night call.
-Not at all.

28:09.813 --> 28:11.940
Why do you think he confessed?

28:12.023 --> 28:14.442
How can we understand
a psycho's intentions?

28:24.577 --> 28:27.205
I've been telling you again and again.

28:30.083 --> 28:31.626
I want to see Detective Choi Hyung-in

28:32.252 --> 28:34.337
of the mobile investigative unit.

28:37.215 --> 28:38.842
I won't talk to anyone else

28:38.925 --> 28:40.468
if you don't bring him here.

28:41.469 --> 28:43.555
You don't know my face, I see.

28:47.642 --> 28:49.060
Do you happen to be

28:49.894 --> 28:51.646
Detective Choi Hyung-in?

28:54.441 --> 28:55.984
Oh, you are.

28:56.693 --> 29:00.196
You look
exactly like you do in that photo.

29:05.952 --> 29:07.328
What? A photo?

29:08.663 --> 29:09.748
Yes, sir.

29:10.832 --> 29:12.667
Detective Choi Hyung-in.

29:24.179 --> 29:25.472
Mr. Kim Hwan-gyu.

29:26.306 --> 29:28.516
Are you taking orders
from someone by any chance?

29:29.893 --> 29:30.894
No.

29:31.644 --> 29:32.979
There's nothing like that.

29:34.481 --> 29:36.983
But someone showed you my picture.

29:38.318 --> 29:40.069
Did that person order you

29:40.612 --> 29:41.905
to kidnap the girl?

29:44.157 --> 29:46.367
And is Jae-young

29:47.494 --> 29:49.120
with that person right now?

29:53.124 --> 29:55.293
You're asking all the wrong questions.

30:03.218 --> 30:06.846
But Detective Choi,
can I ask you something?

30:11.643 --> 30:12.811
What do you think?

30:14.312 --> 30:15.438
Will Guru

30:16.898 --> 30:18.483
love me?

30:25.073 --> 30:27.075
Why are you asking me that?

30:27.867 --> 30:29.786
And who is Guru for that matter?

30:32.205 --> 30:34.666
Is he the one behind all of this?

30:36.668 --> 30:38.253
Did he also give you orders?

30:38.336 --> 30:39.629
Guru told me

30:41.005 --> 30:43.424
you would tear me apart.

30:44.050 --> 30:46.427
-What?
-After I tell you everything,

30:47.303 --> 30:48.888
he said you would

30:49.931 --> 30:52.016
peel the skin off my body with a knife.

30:52.892 --> 30:54.686
-Hey, Mr. Kim Hwan-gyu.
-And then

30:55.645 --> 30:58.147
you would pour scalding hot water on me.

30:58.231 --> 30:59.607
What nonsense is this?

30:59.691 --> 31:01.276
And when I beg for mercy,

31:02.485 --> 31:03.903
you will

31:04.571 --> 31:06.573
spit on me.

31:10.869 --> 31:12.328
Damn it.

31:13.872 --> 31:15.832
I finally see what's going on now.

31:19.836 --> 31:21.921
I don't know who this Guru guy is.

31:23.214 --> 31:25.425
But based on the crazy stuff
he's telling you,

31:25.508 --> 31:27.552
he's not going to protect you at all.

31:29.137 --> 31:30.722
If it's proven that

31:31.598 --> 31:33.892
you committed the kidnapping alone,

31:35.602 --> 31:37.854
then your life will be over,
Mr. Kim Hwan-gyu.

31:38.563 --> 31:41.107
You'll rot in prison
and never see the light of the day.

31:42.567 --> 31:44.193
Every word you say

31:45.737 --> 31:48.031
will determine your fate.

31:48.114 --> 31:49.532
So Mr. Kim,

31:50.491 --> 31:52.952
you better think before you speak.

31:57.206 --> 31:58.249
Is this conversation

31:59.208 --> 32:01.252
being recorded, by any chance?

32:01.961 --> 32:03.963
I could turn off the microphone
if you want.

32:04.047 --> 32:05.006
No.

32:05.882 --> 32:06.966
Keep recording.

32:07.050 --> 32:09.218
Okay. Start talking.

32:09.886 --> 32:11.012
I

32:13.056 --> 32:14.599
kidnapped Jo Jae-young

32:16.392 --> 32:18.019
on July 15th,

32:19.228 --> 32:22.106
-and on the next day, July 16th,
-Hey Kim Hwan-gyu.

32:22.190 --> 32:24.400
I strangled Jo Jae-young to death.

32:25.068 --> 32:27.528
-After that, I cut her body into pieces.
-Kim Hwan-gyu!

32:27.612 --> 32:29.530
I loaded the body parts onto a car

32:30.239 --> 32:32.784
and threw them over the Busan Bridge
into the ocean.

32:33.826 --> 32:36.245
I carried this out alone.

32:37.080 --> 32:38.456
I regret…

32:41.834 --> 32:43.586
the crime I committed.

32:47.507 --> 32:49.676
I'll ask you to start again.
Speak the truth.

32:52.762 --> 32:53.930
Did you

32:54.973 --> 32:56.975
kill Jo Jae-young?

32:58.768 --> 32:59.811
Yes.

33:01.813 --> 33:03.272
I killed her.

33:09.696 --> 33:12.740
Start over from the top, you bastard.

33:18.663 --> 33:19.831
I

33:22.667 --> 33:23.960
kidnapped Jo Jae-young

33:25.795 --> 33:27.380
on July 15th,

33:29.215 --> 33:31.009
and on the next day, July 16th…

33:33.261 --> 33:37.098
CONDOLENCES

33:59.328 --> 34:02.915
Jae-young was a special classmate to us.

34:04.125 --> 34:07.879
Although she had recently
transferred to our school,

34:07.962 --> 34:09.464
she was a model student

34:10.048 --> 34:11.674
and made many friends.

34:11.758 --> 34:14.719
She was loved by many students.

34:15.887 --> 34:19.557
We've lost Jae-young in an unexpected way,

34:20.224 --> 34:24.896
but we'll always remember her.

34:31.694 --> 34:33.362
Would you like me to
drive around the school?

34:34.739 --> 34:36.199
Yes, could you?

34:36.949 --> 34:40.953
Let Jae-young's soul
see her school one last time.

35:06.521 --> 35:07.522
Aunt.

35:08.147 --> 35:09.232
Aunt.

35:12.902 --> 35:14.278
When did she log in?

35:14.987 --> 35:16.155
A month ago.

35:17.949 --> 35:19.659
She didn't say anything else?

35:19.742 --> 35:23.121
She said we'd find it
in the 1987 school magazine.

35:23.204 --> 35:24.330
And then she logged off.

35:24.413 --> 35:26.541
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

35:27.542 --> 35:30.169
Well, she didn't say anything else.

35:30.253 --> 35:33.548
We thought someone was
playing a prank on us.

35:34.382 --> 35:36.759
But you should have still told me!

35:42.348 --> 35:43.599
I'm sorry.

35:48.855 --> 35:49.856
But

35:51.065 --> 35:52.650
we…

35:54.777 --> 35:55.778
Don't cry.

35:56.654 --> 35:58.114
You're making me cry now.

35:59.782 --> 36:00.700
We…

36:01.450 --> 36:02.660
We never imagined

36:04.328 --> 36:07.915
that Jae-young would be dead.

36:10.459 --> 36:12.044
We believed that

36:12.587 --> 36:15.006
she would return
as if nothing had happened.

36:16.591 --> 36:19.760
And we didn't want to worry you, Aunt.

36:21.137 --> 36:23.639
That's why we didn't tell you.

36:24.599 --> 36:27.602
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

36:33.024 --> 36:34.233
You don't need to be.

36:34.817 --> 36:38.029
Moon-sook, I'm sorry.

36:39.530 --> 36:41.657
I'm sorry for getting mad.

36:44.493 --> 36:45.786
Don't cry.

37:17.485 --> 37:19.237
What's the matter?

37:19.779 --> 37:22.114
Why are we going to the crematorium
when her body wasn't found?

37:22.198 --> 37:24.659
But we can't do it without you.

37:24.742 --> 37:26.953
It's okay. I can take care of it later.

37:29.747 --> 37:33.876
Min-jae, Young-seob knew that
Jae-young was going to be kidnapped.

37:34.543 --> 37:36.045
It doesn't add up.

37:36.921 --> 37:39.382
And the symbol I saw
in Kim Hwan-gyu's home

37:39.465 --> 37:41.384
is the same symbol we saw ten years ago.

37:42.510 --> 37:45.972
That bastard, Kim Hwan-gyu,
could not have done this by himself.

37:46.681 --> 37:49.308
What does it matter at this point?

37:49.392 --> 37:50.601
No, Mom.

37:50.685 --> 37:52.270
Jae-young might still be alive.

37:52.353 --> 37:53.562
Jung-hyun…

37:54.814 --> 37:55.898
Even if

37:57.108 --> 37:58.901
Jae-young is actually dead,

38:00.486 --> 38:02.154
I'm going to find out what I can.

38:02.822 --> 38:04.490
There's nothing holding me back now.

38:06.242 --> 38:09.120
I'm going to find Young-seob's family
and get answers from them.

38:09.203 --> 38:10.621
If that doesn't work…

38:15.251 --> 38:16.877
I'm going to see that bastard too.

38:16.961 --> 38:18.379
What did you just say?

38:20.256 --> 38:22.008
Don't you even think about it.

38:34.437 --> 38:35.438
Anyone in there?

38:38.399 --> 38:40.735
Are there any adults at home?

38:40.818 --> 38:41.819
Who are you?

38:41.902 --> 38:44.113
I came here before.

38:44.196 --> 38:46.574
A person called Jung Young-seob
used to live here.

38:48.117 --> 38:49.243
Who are you?

38:49.327 --> 38:52.538
Hello. I'm a friend of Young-seob.

38:52.621 --> 38:54.040
Young-seob?

38:54.123 --> 38:55.666
Who is Young-seob?

38:55.750 --> 38:59.337
He used to live here.
You don't know him? It's Jung Young-seob.

38:59.420 --> 39:02.465
I don't know who you're talking about.

39:03.049 --> 39:07.219
My son and I live here
with my granddaughter.

39:07.303 --> 39:09.305
No such person
called Young-seob lives here.

39:10.306 --> 39:14.185
If it's okay with you,
can I take a look around your house?

39:14.268 --> 39:16.979
-What?
-I know it's a big favor to ask.

39:17.063 --> 39:18.939
Could you please let me?

39:19.023 --> 39:22.193
Oh gosh. What is the meaning of this?

39:25.363 --> 39:26.489
Thank you.

39:35.956 --> 39:37.708
That's our storage room.

39:40.044 --> 39:41.837
This is the house. I remember.

39:44.382 --> 39:46.342
So how long have you lived here?

39:46.425 --> 39:49.595
We moved here ten years ago.

39:55.518 --> 39:56.477
Hello?

39:56.560 --> 39:58.979
<i>Are you a renter? Is that why you came?</i>

39:59.063 --> 40:00.106
A renter?

40:00.189 --> 40:04.318
<i>Aren't you the people who came by before,
asking to rent our house?</i>

40:16.747 --> 40:18.999
YOUNG-SEOB'S MOM

40:20.918 --> 40:24.547
<i>The number you have dialed
cannot be reached…</i>

40:46.485 --> 40:47.695
JO JUNG-HYUN

41:15.598 --> 41:17.391
The doctor said I'll get better

41:18.309 --> 41:20.603
even though it won't be a full recovery.

41:21.979 --> 41:23.898
So please stop looking at me like that.

41:24.523 --> 41:25.566
It's very awkward.

41:31.447 --> 41:32.781
I'm thinking about

41:33.782 --> 41:35.201
quitting the force.

41:41.749 --> 41:44.293
I did some research
and found that we could transfer

41:44.376 --> 41:47.004
to a state-owned company
since we worked as civil servants.

41:47.087 --> 41:50.090
With some luck, I think I can get us
transferred to the same place.

41:51.300 --> 41:53.219
But we'll have to take an English test.

41:54.303 --> 41:55.554
So let's prepare for it.

41:56.263 --> 41:57.264
What?

41:57.973 --> 41:59.058
What did you say?

42:00.851 --> 42:04.063
I'm getting sick and tired…

42:06.690 --> 42:08.400
but it's not because of you.

42:20.496 --> 42:22.748
Detective Choi,
do you know what you're eating?

42:22.831 --> 42:23.916
What?

42:23.999 --> 42:25.292
The snack you're eating with your beer.

42:26.252 --> 42:28.379
That's a snack I made for your dog.

42:28.462 --> 42:29.588
I told you earlier.

42:31.257 --> 42:33.884
Oh, is that so? It was on the table. So…

42:33.968 --> 42:35.678
I put it there to let it cool.

42:36.762 --> 42:39.765
I was going to stop you sooner,
but you seemed to like it.

42:39.848 --> 42:42.685
It's rather tasteless. You sure like it.

42:48.649 --> 42:49.858
Oh, it's good.

43:01.245 --> 43:02.830
<i>New voice message.</i>

43:04.415 --> 43:07.293
<i>Detective Choi,
you're not answering my calls now.</i>

43:07.376 --> 43:10.629
<i>I heard that the girls
from the school's broadcasting club</i>

43:10.713 --> 43:13.215
<i>gave you a cassette tape.</i>

43:13.299 --> 43:16.802
<i>I was wondering if I could listen to it.</i>

43:16.885 --> 43:19.013
<i>Please call me back
when you hear this message.</i>

43:19.096 --> 43:20.389
<i>I'll wait for your call.</i>

43:33.319 --> 43:35.696
Has your family come to visit you?

43:37.698 --> 43:40.826
Yes, my sister came to visit just once.

43:41.619 --> 43:44.246
Do you remember the conversation
you had with her?

43:45.164 --> 43:46.624
Yes, I do.

43:47.833 --> 43:50.753
She pretended to be calm,
but she was very anxious.

43:52.254 --> 43:54.340
She also seemed to be terrified.

43:56.717 --> 43:58.135
Why do you think

43:59.053 --> 44:01.680
she thought she had to see you
all of a sudden?

44:04.516 --> 44:05.851
I don't know.

44:08.729 --> 44:11.732
That's a question
I would like to ask you instead.

44:14.610 --> 44:17.237
Don't you think you came too late?

44:20.199 --> 44:21.575
You came too late.

44:23.327 --> 44:25.746
SEPTEMBER 10, 1999

45:17.589 --> 45:19.049
Hi Jung-hyun.

45:23.846 --> 45:26.181
I can't talk you out of quitting, right?

45:26.932 --> 45:28.016
No, Chief.

45:28.642 --> 45:31.979
-What do you plan on doing?
-I'll transfer to a state company first.

45:32.062 --> 45:33.272
Once I settle down,

45:36.108 --> 45:38.527
-I'm thinking about getting a degree.
-What kind of degree?

45:39.820 --> 45:41.572
It's just an idea for now.

45:43.615 --> 45:45.409
A degree in criminal psychology, maybe.

45:45.492 --> 45:47.911
Since you meet crazy criminals,

45:47.995 --> 45:50.497
you must want to know
how their minds work.

46:13.687 --> 46:16.231
Did anyone leave a package for me?
A cassette tape.

46:16.315 --> 46:17.733
Oh, that.

46:17.816 --> 46:20.736
I left it at the hospital by mistake
when I went to see Detective Lee.

46:21.528 --> 46:22.863
He didn't give it to you?

46:23.530 --> 46:24.990
Okay. I'll call him.

46:31.455 --> 46:34.500
I haven't seen your face
in 12 years, right?

46:36.585 --> 46:38.003
I'll get straight to the point.

46:38.670 --> 46:39.838
Jae-young is missing.

46:41.298 --> 46:42.633
I already know.

46:42.716 --> 46:43.884
Did you plan it?

46:45.844 --> 46:48.889
-Jung-hyun.
-It's you? Right?

46:50.140 --> 46:51.141
You did this, right?

46:52.476 --> 46:54.228
Do you think I didn't know?

46:54.311 --> 46:56.522
I knew you were contacting Jae-young.

46:56.605 --> 46:59.274
So don't play games with me.

46:59.983 --> 47:01.401
Tell me what you know.

47:05.697 --> 47:07.741
What I know… Let's see.

47:08.283 --> 47:10.953
I wasn't in direct contact with Jae-young.

47:11.036 --> 47:11.954
What?

47:12.037 --> 47:13.956
Let me set the record straight.

47:14.790 --> 47:18.752
Did it ever cross your mind that Jae-young
might have reached out to me first?

47:18.835 --> 47:21.255
Don't you say that. That's crazy.

47:21.338 --> 47:23.048
Why does it sound crazy?

47:25.300 --> 47:27.302
I don't have time for these games.

47:28.095 --> 47:31.014
Just tell me what you know.

47:32.015 --> 47:34.434
You're worried about Jae-young

47:34.518 --> 47:37.062
but you don't know anything about her.

47:37.145 --> 47:39.439
I know a lot more than you do
as you rot in prison.

47:39.523 --> 47:40.566
No.

47:42.025 --> 47:44.111
I'm asking you for real, Jung-hyun.

47:44.945 --> 47:46.738
Do you really know her well?

47:46.822 --> 47:47.781
For example,

47:48.365 --> 47:50.284
have you mentioned me to her?

47:52.411 --> 47:54.371
Have you ever talked about

47:55.289 --> 47:58.041
what I did that day to her?

47:58.834 --> 47:59.876
No.

48:00.419 --> 48:02.129
Because it's unnecessary.

48:02.963 --> 48:04.715
Why do you get to decide that?

48:04.798 --> 48:07.009
You've got some nerve
to say that, you know.

48:07.092 --> 48:08.885
Have you gone crazy in your prison cell?

48:08.969 --> 48:10.721
What I did

48:11.847 --> 48:14.933
is like an unavoidable destiny
to Jae-young.

48:15.017 --> 48:16.435
So why are you rejecting it?

48:17.853 --> 48:19.229
By not mentioning it,

48:20.147 --> 48:21.440
you might have created

48:22.024 --> 48:25.569
unnecessary guilt
to grow inside Jae-young's mind.

48:25.652 --> 48:26.486
Guilt?

48:26.570 --> 48:28.739
Why should she be ridden
by guilt because of what you did?

48:28.822 --> 48:29.823
Who do you think you are?

48:30.657 --> 48:33.619
You're dead to us.

48:35.329 --> 48:36.705
That's not possible.

48:38.123 --> 48:41.209
Jung-hyun, you're totally delusional.

48:46.048 --> 48:47.716
You still don't get it?

48:58.560 --> 49:00.479
Why did you return to Saju?

49:01.188 --> 49:02.022
What?

49:02.105 --> 49:05.192
Why did you decide
to return to our hometown?

49:05.275 --> 49:07.194
Because Jae-young wanted to go back.

49:08.070 --> 49:10.238
Let me rephrase the question.

49:11.031 --> 49:13.367
Why do you think Jae-young
wanted to return to Saju?

49:13.450 --> 49:15.869
And why didn't you ask her
why she wanted that?

49:15.952 --> 49:17.454
What were you afraid of?

49:19.247 --> 49:21.833
Because she might have mentioned that
if you had asked?

49:22.417 --> 49:23.293
Shut up.

49:57.119 --> 49:58.537
Hold on for a second.

50:00.038 --> 50:02.582
I found it.

50:03.291 --> 50:06.253
It got thrown into a bag with other stuff.
I forgot about it.

50:06.336 --> 50:08.463
<i>I'll come to pick it up then.</i>

50:08.547 --> 50:11.466
<i>I'll call you on my way
after I get off work.</i>

50:11.550 --> 50:13.719
Sure. Call me then.

50:40.162 --> 50:41.788
What did you just do?

50:42.414 --> 50:43.915
I'm calming you down.

50:47.335 --> 50:49.129
Did you try this on Jae-young too?

50:49.713 --> 50:50.839
Try what?

50:52.299 --> 50:54.009
Jae-young's kidnapping.

50:54.926 --> 50:58.597
Did you hypnotize Kim Hwan-gyu
to kidnap her?

51:04.603 --> 51:05.854
There was…

51:08.106 --> 51:09.274
no reason…

51:11.067 --> 51:13.653
for Kim Hwan-gyu to kidnap Jae-young.

51:16.406 --> 51:19.075
I'm not defending him.

51:21.203 --> 51:22.287
But…

51:23.830 --> 51:25.040
Hwan-gyu had…

51:26.625 --> 51:27.959
no motive…

51:29.586 --> 51:33.632
to kill Jae-young, whatsoever.

51:36.009 --> 51:37.219
Jae-young…

51:39.596 --> 51:41.056
was a nice kid.

51:43.934 --> 51:45.727
You don't see kids like that often.

51:50.774 --> 51:55.070
Mom, Jae-young and I

51:57.739 --> 51:59.741
were living hidden lives.

52:02.244 --> 52:04.329
Like moles living underground…

52:07.415 --> 52:08.708
It's all

52:10.168 --> 52:13.004
because of you that we had to…

52:16.049 --> 52:17.759
live like this.

52:20.887 --> 52:22.138
Tell me.

52:24.057 --> 52:26.184
What have you done?

52:27.060 --> 52:28.812
You crazy bastard.

52:34.943 --> 52:36.236
Jung-hyun.

52:38.154 --> 52:40.365
There is something you forgot.

52:42.158 --> 52:45.078
You're the most important person
in this plan.

52:47.956 --> 52:51.543
But you're removing yourself from it.

52:59.092 --> 53:00.218
What?

53:00.802 --> 53:02.554
Why did you come to see me?

53:03.555 --> 53:05.348
What came to your mind
to compel you to see me?

53:05.432 --> 53:07.267
Do you understand what I'm saying?

53:10.729 --> 53:12.355
Cut the bullshit.

53:14.941 --> 53:16.526
I'll tell you.

53:17.736 --> 53:20.280
You came here after seeing that symbol.

53:20.363 --> 53:21.990
But you still haven't asked me

53:22.657 --> 53:25.118
anything about that.

53:27.495 --> 53:30.874
Jung-hyun, why aren't you asking
any questions about that?

53:33.293 --> 53:35.170
Because you're afraid?

53:36.713 --> 53:40.216
When we left the orphanage
a long time ago,

53:42.552 --> 53:45.388
I planted that inside you.

53:49.351 --> 53:52.520
This story begins with me,
Jae-young and you.

53:53.730 --> 53:55.440
You can't forget that.

53:57.317 --> 53:59.694
If you do, you'll commit the same mistake.

53:59.778 --> 54:02.656
And then it'll lead to the same event.

54:04.866 --> 54:07.827
You'll never be able to
go back to a normal life.

54:07.911 --> 54:08.954
Jung-hyun.

55:03.883 --> 55:06.469
<i>The number you have dialed
cannot be reached,</i>

55:06.553 --> 55:07.971
<i>please leave a message…</i>

55:18.023 --> 55:20.358
Excuse me. I'd like another beer.

55:21.317 --> 55:22.360
Okay.

55:41.212 --> 55:43.339
Detective Choi called.

55:44.215 --> 55:45.425
Oh, he did?

55:46.176 --> 55:47.802
I guess he'll be here soon.

55:48.386 --> 55:49.304
Yes.

55:49.971 --> 55:51.306
Is that the tape?

55:54.684 --> 55:57.562
Yes, I thought I'd listened to it.

56:07.322 --> 56:09.699
The whistling sound is so creepy.

56:09.783 --> 56:10.992
Whistling sound?

56:13.161 --> 56:15.080
I can't hear any whistling.

56:16.748 --> 56:17.832
Really?

56:18.666 --> 56:22.170
There's a bell ringing
and whistling sounds.

56:22.253 --> 56:23.505
Really?

56:47.987 --> 56:52.659
<i>The candidates are stopping by towns
and campaigning vigorously.</i>

56:53.243 --> 56:55.161
<i>Candidate Lim of the Chamsahwe Party</i>

56:55.245 --> 56:58.832
<i>predicts victory as he points out
the strong support he's getting.</i>

56:58.915 --> 57:01.376
<i>Candidate Lim is asking voters
to elect him</i>

57:01.459 --> 57:04.087
<i>because Saju needs someone
to lift its economy.</i>

57:04.170 --> 57:06.131
<i>He says it's time for a fresh new face,</i>

57:06.214 --> 57:08.049
<i>and promised to get
the stalled Saju power plant</i>

57:08.133 --> 57:11.052
<i>off the ground and breathe new energy
into the economy.</i>

57:57.307 --> 57:58.433
Are you okay?

57:59.684 --> 58:01.311
Did you have a nightmare again?

58:02.604 --> 58:04.022
Yes. I'm fine.

58:06.024 --> 58:08.693
Go back to sleep. I need a glass of water.

1:00:27.206 --> 1:00:28.374
Are you awake?

1:00:38.301 --> 1:00:39.552
What is that?

1:00:40.178 --> 1:00:41.721
This has never happened before.

1:01:43.658 --> 1:01:46.494
NO TRESPASSING

1:02:08.516 --> 1:02:11.477
NO TRESPASSING

1:04:56.684 --> 1:04:58.311
<i>Did Guru command you</i>

1:04:59.520 --> 1:05:01.355
<i>to commit those acts?</i>

1:05:01.439 --> 1:05:05.151
Do you really think
you can get the answers you want from me?

1:05:05.234 --> 1:05:08.362
<i>We want to learn the truth.</i>

1:05:08.446 --> 1:05:10.615
<i>Do you recall it now? Your friends.</i>

1:05:11.407 --> 1:05:13.784
<i>What you're really curious
about is this, isn't it?</i>

1:05:13.868 --> 1:05:15.786
<i>Who is Guru?</i>

1:05:15.870 --> 1:05:17.580
<i>What have you done to me?</i>

1:05:19.498 --> 1:05:21.125
Guru told me

1:05:21.208 --> 1:05:23.878
<i>you weren't like a living person.</i>

1:05:27.214 --> 1:05:32.219
