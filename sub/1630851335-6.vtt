00:05.756 --> 00:08.092
"Men's orgasms last
between 5 and 10 seconds,

00:08.175 --> 00:11.178
while women's orgasms
can last longer than 15 seconds.

00:11.262 --> 00:14.265
Therefore, the chances of a couple having
a simultaneous orgasm are rare."

00:17.601 --> 00:18.894
We are complete now.

00:33.284 --> 00:34.493
Hey! Hey!

00:34.744 --> 00:36.912
You finally made it!
How are you guys?

00:36.996 --> 00:38.289
- Hi.
- Hello.

00:39.999 --> 00:42.042
Wow. You look great, man.

00:43.502 --> 00:46.839
- I thought it was a costume party.
- Want a beer?

00:47.465 --> 00:49.258
- Okay.
- Okay. Excuse me.

00:50.259 --> 00:51.719
- Well...
- See you later.

00:56.265 --> 00:58.142
- Hello.
- Hi.

00:58.684 --> 01:00.186
- How are you, darling?
- Fine.

01:00.269 --> 01:01.896
- I'll take your coat.
- Thank you.

01:03.230 --> 01:05.399
It's nice that we're all here.

01:05.816 --> 01:09.862
- I thought you weren't coming.
- It's just so exciting.

01:10.279 --> 01:14.283
I wasn't coming.
It's not like I lied to you...

01:15.075 --> 01:18.204
- Valentín insisted and...
- Come on, Gaby.

01:18.287 --> 01:21.248
Stop making excuses.
We're all here for a reason.

01:21.665 --> 01:23.709
And you look gorgeous.

01:24.960 --> 01:25.920
Thank you.

01:26.462 --> 01:30.883
What are you doing here?
And showing all of this cleavage!

01:30.966 --> 01:34.970
-I would've never expected it.
-We changed plans at the last minute.

01:36.639 --> 01:39.266
Wow! The ladies finally dared to come!

01:39.975 --> 01:42.436
I mean, wow that you are here.
It's so cool.

01:42.561 --> 01:45.564
I feel like I'm an old soul.

01:45.898 --> 01:48.776
You know? That's why I feel
so attached to your generation.

01:49.777 --> 01:52.655
- Cheers to our "generation."
- Cheers.

01:52.738 --> 01:54.156
- Cheers.
- You are so sweet.

01:54.532 --> 01:58.410
I love your music.
90s music is so vintage.

01:58.494 --> 01:59.954
I love that music!

02:00.538 --> 02:01.705
Vintage?

02:01.789 --> 02:04.583
We were in high school in the 90s.

02:05.084 --> 02:07.419
What do you mean? How old are you?

02:07.503 --> 02:09.880
This old lady needs a glass of wine.

02:10.005 --> 02:11.715
And I need my husband.

02:12.091 --> 02:15.511
- And I need a tequila.
- What kind of music was in the 70s?

02:15.594 --> 02:16.595
Disco music.

02:25.688 --> 02:27.565
Kombucha!

02:27.648 --> 02:29.900
- Were you looking for this?
- You scared me.

02:30.359 --> 02:31.652
That's right.

02:32.278 --> 02:33.445
I thought so.

02:34.738 --> 02:35.781
What?

02:36.866 --> 02:39.285
- Are you nervous?
- No. Of course not.

02:39.368 --> 02:41.453
I just needed a drink.

02:42.162 --> 02:45.457
- Thanks.
- You look amazing in red.

02:47.251 --> 02:48.836
You should wear it more often.

02:50.462 --> 02:53.132
Thanks. I'll keep that in mind.

02:57.303 --> 02:59.889
- Are you gathering courage?
- No.

03:00.389 --> 03:01.348
No?

03:01.807 --> 03:03.350
I'm ready to play.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.730
The guy whose keys you'll pick...

03:09.481 --> 03:11.066
is going to be very lucky.

03:14.778 --> 03:17.197
Maybe you'll get lucky tonight.

03:23.162 --> 03:26.540
Hey, guys! It's time to play! Join me.

03:27.917 --> 03:29.084
Come here.

03:35.007 --> 03:36.258
I'll do it gladly.

03:40.137 --> 03:43.098
Excellent. Now, it's our turn.

03:43.724 --> 03:44.808
Who goes first?

03:45.142 --> 03:46.560
You go first, Adriana.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.526
Just pick one!

04:10.834 --> 04:13.504
Come on, ladies, cheer up!
This is a party!

04:30.187 --> 04:31.355
Okay.

04:32.731 --> 04:34.024
Who's your match tonight?

04:41.991 --> 04:42.908
Good!

04:43.367 --> 04:45.661
Those are mine.
I'm Pato, nice to meet you.

04:46.412 --> 04:47.621
Hello, Pato.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.586
These are yours, aren't they, Valentín?

04:58.424 --> 05:01.176
These are house keys, not car keys...

05:01.260 --> 05:04.013
They are mine. My car happens
to be at the shop.

05:07.266 --> 05:09.518
I think these keys are familiar to me.

05:20.112 --> 05:21.238
And these?

05:22.197 --> 05:23.449
Okay...

05:26.660 --> 05:29.329
Let the party begin!

05:31.832 --> 05:33.417
Cheers!

05:33.625 --> 05:35.377
Cheers!

05:39.381 --> 05:42.092
THE GAME OF KEYS

05:47.431 --> 05:49.767
- Shall I close the door?
- Yes, please.

05:51.101 --> 05:52.227
You're so kind.

06:02.488 --> 06:03.530
Right.

06:04.573 --> 06:06.784
- I want to fuck. I want to fuck.
- What?

06:07.576 --> 06:08.619
What?

06:09.578 --> 06:14.041
Oh, nothing. I was looking
at your picture and wondered...

06:14.208 --> 06:17.044
Is that your real body or Photoshop?

06:22.508 --> 06:23.592
Look.

06:25.302 --> 06:26.512
You can touch.

06:32.059 --> 06:33.185
Touch me!

06:37.106 --> 06:39.691
My God! You are gorgeous.

06:40.275 --> 06:43.112
- You don't need Photoshop.
- I'm a model too.

06:44.655 --> 06:47.282
- Excellent, Pato.
- I'm glad you've liked me.

06:47.533 --> 06:51.537
- Because you, dear lady...
- No, please. Call me Adriana.

06:51.620 --> 06:55.207
- Otherwise you make me feel old.
- You're not old!

06:55.457 --> 06:58.794
You are beautiful,
and you must be very skilled.

07:00.462 --> 07:02.381
I was hoping you'd pick out my keys.

07:20.065 --> 07:21.942
- A beer?
- Okay.

07:22.568 --> 07:24.194
- Fine.
- No, come here.

07:24.695 --> 07:25.737
Like this.

07:31.493 --> 07:32.619
No. Wait.

07:33.579 --> 07:34.621
What?

07:36.582 --> 07:37.833
What?

07:37.916 --> 07:40.085
Are you sure we should do it?

07:41.211 --> 07:44.131
- Are you having second thoughts?
- Remember last time.

07:46.008 --> 07:50.012
What if it's a test
and Adriana gets pissed off again?

07:51.680 --> 07:53.432
Adriana is having...

07:54.683 --> 07:56.268
a great time.

08:03.609 --> 08:05.027
- Wait.
- What?

08:05.194 --> 08:07.905
- Let's enjoy this.
- Okay. Show me.

08:08.197 --> 08:09.406
Follow me.

08:20.584 --> 08:22.044
Okay. I'll tell you.

08:22.586 --> 08:24.254
It turns me on.

08:26.256 --> 08:30.052
My first crush was
my Biology teacher, Miss Álvarez.

08:30.219 --> 08:32.804
In ninth grade.
She never smiled.

08:33.722 --> 08:36.683
She'd scold like shit
if you were late.

08:37.935 --> 08:40.062
But when she was writing
on the blackboard...

08:41.605 --> 08:44.024
I couldn't help but look
at her beautiful ass.

08:45.067 --> 08:49.696
That's why I didn't really learn much
about Biology but a lot about asses.

08:53.450 --> 08:54.618
Morales!

08:55.202 --> 08:56.203
Yes, Barbs?

08:56.578 --> 08:58.497
Miss Álvarez!

08:59.623 --> 09:00.666
Yes, Miss?

09:01.583 --> 09:05.254
Wipe that sly smile out of your face.
And tell me...

09:06.713 --> 09:08.674
Did you learn today's lesson?

09:09.841 --> 09:11.593
No, Miss Álvarez. I'm sorry.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.220
I was absent-minded.

09:14.972 --> 09:18.350
Do I have to teach you
the Anatomy lesson again?

09:19.518 --> 09:21.103
I think you do, Miss Álvarez.

09:24.523 --> 09:27.859
These... are my mammary glands.

09:28.860 --> 09:30.320
Do you like them, Morales?

09:30.946 --> 09:32.614
I love them, Miss Álvarez.

09:36.451 --> 09:38.203
You are young and energetic.

09:40.956 --> 09:42.207
Congratulations.

09:44.126 --> 09:45.335
You are amazing.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.258
No, no. Wait! What are you doing?

09:51.383 --> 09:52.926
No one has done this to you before?

09:54.553 --> 09:57.431
Obviously, the prostate is a man's G-spot.

09:57.556 --> 09:58.974
Good. I think it's great.

10:00.517 --> 10:03.353
- That feels really good.
- You liked it?

10:03.687 --> 10:06.398
I did. It feels uncomfortable but good.

10:09.109 --> 10:11.570
Wait! Wait! I was liking it.

10:11.820 --> 10:14.865
- Trust me. You'll like it more.
- Really?

10:24.207 --> 10:25.334
What's that?

10:26.043 --> 10:30.380
I'll let you pick one of my toys.

10:31.548 --> 10:32.799
But I don't want to.

10:33.091 --> 10:36.261
That's not an option. Just pick one.

10:37.054 --> 10:40.015
- We can start with this one.
- No...

10:41.767 --> 10:42.726
Well...

10:43.560 --> 10:46.438
We can use this short one.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.066
It could feel nice. The other one...

10:50.067 --> 10:51.985
- Just trust me, okay?
- Okay.

10:52.110 --> 10:53.779
Then we could use this one here.

10:55.739 --> 10:56.698
Okay.

10:57.449 --> 11:00.786
Most people claim the best oysters
can be found in Marseille.

11:01.078 --> 11:03.205
Are they really aphrodisiacs?

11:04.748 --> 11:08.668
Some say yes, some say no.
Others think it's a myth...

11:14.049 --> 11:15.342
Did I scare you?

11:16.468 --> 11:19.012
No. You...

11:19.429 --> 11:21.098
You just took me by surprise.

11:23.141 --> 11:25.185
I'm not getting used to this game, Siena.

11:25.685 --> 11:28.397
Relax. Let me guide you.

11:42.119 --> 11:43.954
How do you and Sergio make love?

11:46.456 --> 11:49.584
Sergio and I? In different ways.

11:51.461 --> 11:55.465
- Like what?
- We start kissing. Like this.

12:11.690 --> 12:13.650
Why didn't you mention you were gay?

12:15.569 --> 12:16.778
Because I'm not.

12:19.531 --> 12:21.658
I'm married to a woman, Gaby.

12:24.202 --> 12:25.203
Relax.

12:26.455 --> 12:29.541
I know it's hard,
but you don't need to pretend with me.

12:31.877 --> 12:34.421
I've been attracted to women too.

12:36.131 --> 12:37.799
Don't feel bad.

12:39.050 --> 12:39.968
Siena...

12:43.180 --> 12:44.681
I swear I love my wife.

12:46.516 --> 12:47.934
That's the point of this game.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.438
Figuring out who we really are.

13:54.501 --> 13:55.669
I'm sorry.

13:57.420 --> 13:58.547
I'm so sorry.

13:59.506 --> 14:00.715
It's okay.

14:01.258 --> 14:04.427
- That can happen to anybody.
- It always happens to me.

14:05.428 --> 14:07.138
It must be the steroids.

14:07.472 --> 14:08.473
It's okay.

14:13.937 --> 14:15.730
I've always wanted to play Patrick Swayze.

14:16.815 --> 14:18.900
I've always wanted to be Demi, too.

14:32.455 --> 14:33.415
So?

14:34.457 --> 14:36.835
What grade did I get, Miss Álvarez?

14:37.377 --> 14:38.920
C-.

14:41.006 --> 14:42.632
C-?

14:48.763 --> 14:50.765
Well, you got an A.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.267
Great.

14:53.768 --> 14:56.646
Didn't you ever have sex with a teacher?

14:58.231 --> 15:00.900
Let's just say I was more interested...

15:01.234 --> 15:02.611
in the student body.

15:03.528 --> 15:05.071
You mean Adriana?

15:06.489 --> 15:09.242
Between Adriana and I,
nothing ever happened.

15:10.243 --> 15:11.661
But you wish it had happened.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.707
Adriana and I are just friends.

15:17.167 --> 15:20.462
That's funny.
She says the same thing about you.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.507
Why do you think it's funny?

15:27.385 --> 15:30.889
I think you're both liars.

15:33.058 --> 15:35.226
I'm taking my torn panties with me.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.155
Really? C-?

15:51.409 --> 15:53.411
- I got soap in my eye!
- Let me help you.

15:54.746 --> 15:57.040
Wait. I can't see anything.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.376
Where are you?

15:59.459 --> 16:00.710
I can't see anything.

16:01.378 --> 16:04.464
Oh! Big Óscar!

16:05.006 --> 16:06.549
I've found you.

16:06.633 --> 16:09.386
Really? We can play "Anaconda" now.

16:20.271 --> 16:22.107
I'm glad he's finally here.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.412
- Hi, honey.
- Hello.

16:38.873 --> 16:39.916
No!

16:41.000 --> 16:43.920
Don't tell me you got cold feet again
and you're going to take it out on me?

16:44.129 --> 16:45.797
No, no, no, no.
I didn't hold back.

16:46.506 --> 16:50.093
The boy turned out to be
a pre-mature ejaculator.

16:51.052 --> 16:52.137
Happy now?

16:52.971 --> 16:54.764
He seemed like such an alpha male.

16:56.391 --> 16:58.268
Well, look at the bright side.

16:58.393 --> 17:01.604
Maybe he liked you so much
that he couldn't hold and came.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.815
Don't try and cheer me up.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.359
- Let's go, please.
- Okay.

17:22.417 --> 17:24.461
And you? How did it go?

17:25.837 --> 17:28.298
Good. Normal, I guess.

17:28.840 --> 17:31.092
I think we're all a little...

17:31.176 --> 17:33.928
gay, bisexual, straight.

17:37.265 --> 17:40.435
I think you need to experiment
in order to clear your mind.

17:43.396 --> 17:47.233
What do you suggest?
Take a picture of my penis and post it?

17:47.400 --> 17:48.777
- No.
- I won't do that.

17:48.860 --> 17:50.153
That's not what I'm saying.

17:50.278 --> 17:53.323
Besides, I don't think you're ready
to use those apps.

17:54.365 --> 17:56.159
But I can introduce you to a friend.

17:58.119 --> 17:59.704
I'm married, Siena.

18:01.748 --> 18:04.334
I can be anything you want,
but I'm not a cheater.

18:05.001 --> 18:08.922
What if I told you there's a way
to experience it, without cheating?

18:09.631 --> 18:10.965
Really?

18:11.466 --> 18:15.762
A Game of Keys sexually open
to any possibility.

18:18.097 --> 18:21.226
You can find out whether you're gay
without cheating on your wife.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.563
Listen, I don't have the money yet.

18:26.523 --> 18:29.150
But I'm planning my birthday party

18:29.526 --> 18:31.986
including the game,
and I think it's going to be incredible.

18:32.320 --> 18:33.655
I have money.

18:34.447 --> 18:37.659
- No, Valentin. I can't take it.
- It'll be your birthday gift.

18:38.493 --> 18:40.036
Please?

18:41.830 --> 18:44.249
- Let me give it to you.
- Okay, fine.

18:44.457 --> 18:45.500
Done.

18:47.502 --> 18:48.545
Thank you.

19:13.444 --> 19:14.487
I love you.

19:20.034 --> 19:21.119
Óscar?

19:23.329 --> 19:24.998
Sleep tight, honey.

19:26.583 --> 19:28.084
Good night.

19:29.043 --> 19:30.086
Baby?

20:57.298 --> 20:58.675
Good morning.

21:01.052 --> 21:03.221
I don't know what's good about it.

21:06.015 --> 21:07.642
Are you grumpy?

21:10.812 --> 21:14.065
I told you it was a bad idea
to play again, but you insisted.

21:15.149 --> 21:17.110
I'm not mad, Óscar.

21:17.527 --> 21:20.321
We did well in playing,
and you didn't do anything wrong.

21:20.863 --> 21:24.200
I'm just tired because I didn't get
a good night's sleep.

21:25.368 --> 21:27.078
And I'm stressed.

21:27.161 --> 21:30.540
I have to plan Mica's birthday party.
That's all!

21:37.422 --> 21:38.673
Shall I take care of it?

21:39.716 --> 21:40.883
You look stressed out.

21:41.759 --> 21:43.886
I can handle it. I'm fine.

21:45.138 --> 21:47.974
- And you're not going to act weird?
- What do you mean?

21:48.057 --> 21:51.644
I'm afraid you'll force Mica's friends
to talk to you.

21:52.562 --> 21:55.064
Leave them alone. Mica is 15 now.

21:55.732 --> 21:57.275
Don't mess with her.

21:58.818 --> 22:01.195
And when have I ever messed with her?

22:02.655 --> 22:06.284
She told me you were acting weird
with her friends the other day.

22:07.744 --> 22:09.996
Now I'm acting weird

22:10.038 --> 22:12.248
because I'm worried
that a 15-year-old girl

22:12.373 --> 22:16.544
doesn't want to leave her house
for her birthday?

22:17.211 --> 22:21.424
That she'd she rather stay home and watch
a Japanese cartoon marathon?

22:22.800 --> 22:24.385
It's not porn.

22:25.094 --> 22:28.681
When I turned 15, I went
to the movies to watch "The Matrix"

22:29.348 --> 22:31.684
with my friends,
and it was the best birthday ever.

22:32.268 --> 22:33.853
You were a nerd, too.

22:35.646 --> 22:36.689
Okay.

22:45.573 --> 22:47.700
You can't imagine the look
on the lady's face.

22:48.284 --> 22:51.537
But it was obvious.
Her husband was banging the nanny.

22:53.206 --> 22:56.793
I think listening to voice notes
in public should be punished...

22:57.960 --> 22:59.587
by a death sentence,
or something like that.

23:01.839 --> 23:02.757
Vale?

23:04.509 --> 23:05.802
What's up? Are you okay?

23:06.761 --> 23:09.388
- I thought you were enjoying the chat.
- Sure.

23:09.555 --> 23:12.016
I was thinking of something else.
I'm sorry.

23:12.183 --> 23:14.602
You can tell me, if you want.

23:15.311 --> 23:17.980
Not only am I a good talker,
but a good listener too.

23:23.653 --> 23:27.532
What if someone has doubts
about their own sexual preferences?

23:30.368 --> 23:32.453
Maybe he always thought he was straight

23:32.537 --> 23:34.539
but then he feels different
from other guys.

23:37.250 --> 23:42.547
What if though he has never been
with another guy, sometimes...

23:43.840 --> 23:45.466
he is attracted to one?

23:47.969 --> 23:49.846
Does that necessarily make you gay?

23:51.472 --> 23:53.141
There's a very simple way to find out.

23:55.101 --> 23:56.185
If you want, I can show you.

23:57.812 --> 24:01.023
I mean, if it helps you
with your book, and all that.

24:02.817 --> 24:04.986
Oh, sure. It would be very helpful.

24:31.095 --> 24:32.763
And that's how you find out.

24:37.351 --> 24:38.352
Shall we?

24:40.438 --> 24:41.439
Come on, Chata.

24:43.399 --> 24:44.400
What do you think?

24:47.904 --> 24:49.280
She scolded me.

24:51.115 --> 24:54.076
And made me take Anatomy lessons.

24:54.452 --> 24:55.578
Really?

24:55.828 --> 24:58.080
- And what did you do?
- What could I do?

25:00.124 --> 25:01.334
I listened...

25:03.586 --> 25:05.254
like the good student that I am.

25:08.758 --> 25:10.468
And you? How did it go?

25:13.304 --> 25:15.806
Good. Valentín is very handsome.

25:17.475 --> 25:18.392
Please!

25:18.809 --> 25:20.603
Come on! Tell me!

25:21.270 --> 25:23.147
Better, how about
I show you what I did to him.

25:23.231 --> 25:24.148
Okay.

25:42.917 --> 25:44.627
Good, Akiko! Be confident!

25:45.336 --> 25:48.422
Give me your popcorn,
mine are almost gone.

25:50.132 --> 25:51.467
Here he comes!

25:52.802 --> 25:54.428
He is so cute!

25:54.512 --> 25:56.222
- He is.
- I'm his fan.

25:56.305 --> 25:59.225
I've already started a chat
with the contacts from her school.

25:59.350 --> 26:01.519
As soon as I text them,
they'll be here.

26:02.853 --> 26:05.356
Listen, Adriana.
We've talked about this.

26:06.607 --> 26:10.736
I know. I must leave her alone,
and don't start acting weird.

26:10.861 --> 26:14.615
Let them finish all the episodes.
Then you can talk to them.

26:15.283 --> 26:17.576
- How much longer?
- 500 episodes.

26:17.994 --> 26:19.912
- Do you want pizza?
- Yes.

26:20.246 --> 26:22.164
As soon as this episode ends, okay?

26:22.373 --> 26:23.958
I'll go get the pizzas.

26:24.333 --> 26:26.460
Like in 15 minutes.

26:33.718 --> 26:34.927
Are you okay?

26:35.678 --> 26:37.388
Yes. I'm fine, honey.

26:37.972 --> 26:38.931
You?

26:39.265 --> 26:40.182
Me too.

26:41.183 --> 26:42.351
I'm fine.

26:42.977 --> 26:44.353
- Good.
- Dinner?

26:46.230 --> 26:47.648
Okay. Take-out?

26:48.691 --> 26:50.026
- Okay.
- Sushi?

26:59.577 --> 27:01.954
Here's more popcorn
while the pizza arrives.

27:02.204 --> 27:04.915
- Thank you.
- What are you watching?

27:05.166 --> 27:06.542
"High School Blues", Mom.

27:06.584 --> 27:08.711
Same show
we've been watching for two hours.

27:10.421 --> 27:12.006
Aren't you bored?

27:13.507 --> 27:16.719
Let's have a small chat.
How are you doing with the boys?

27:17.136 --> 27:19.013
- Do any of you have a boyfriend?
- Mom?

27:19.096 --> 27:20.389
- Not me.
- Please?

27:20.431 --> 27:22.767
I had one. But we broke up.
He was so boring.

27:22.975 --> 27:25.019
Good for you!

27:25.311 --> 27:28.230
You guys don't need boring.
Just have fun, girls.

27:28.314 --> 27:30.066
You need to experiment...

27:30.358 --> 27:32.193
You have to meet new friends.

27:32.276 --> 27:35.446
- Madam, did you...?
- Just call me Adriana.

27:36.697 --> 27:38.657
- I love your pigtails.
- Thanks.

27:38.783 --> 27:41.619
Adriana, did you date
many guys at school?

27:43.579 --> 27:44.622
I didn't.

27:45.831 --> 27:48.918
In fact, I married
my high school sweetheart.

27:49.043 --> 27:50.086
Really?

27:52.171 --> 27:56.550
That's why I think it's very important
that you have fun.

27:56.759 --> 27:59.303
I was just a few years older than you are.

28:00.012 --> 28:01.972
Can I make a confession? Okay.

28:03.224 --> 28:05.351
If I could start all over again...

28:06.310 --> 28:10.231
I'd date more guys before getting married.
At least nine more.

28:10.439 --> 28:14.193
Girls, seriously, before you marry,
date at least ten guys.

28:15.277 --> 28:16.278
Really!

28:16.570 --> 28:19.782
Dad, I'm so glad you're back.
Can you take my mom with you?

28:19.990 --> 28:21.534
- In a second.
- Why?

28:24.203 --> 28:25.454
See you later.

28:25.704 --> 28:28.791
- Your mom is so cool.
- I wish mine were like her.

28:29.458 --> 28:30.793
You can have her.

28:33.879 --> 28:37.133
Your life is so disappointing that you
pour it out to a bunch of teenagers?

28:38.342 --> 28:39.635
It isn't like that.

28:41.178 --> 28:45.015
And I'm really sorry for making you
feel bad, I didn't mean to.

28:47.685 --> 28:50.396
What's so messed up between us...

28:50.646 --> 28:53.649
with your family,
that you feel you have to make it right?

28:56.902 --> 28:58.696
Mica is a happy, healthy girl.

28:59.113 --> 29:01.490
And maybe she's not
the most popular girl in school,

29:01.574 --> 29:03.075
but who fucking cares?

29:03.284 --> 29:06.120
I'm sorry! Maybe I'm just projecting
my problems onto her.

29:06.412 --> 29:09.957
What problems?
Are you disappointed in this marriage?

29:12.877 --> 29:14.587
I have the right to wonder

29:14.670 --> 29:17.298
whether I've made
the right decisions in my life.

29:19.508 --> 29:22.261
And I've wondered too...

29:22.887 --> 29:25.890
what it would be like
had I made a different choice.

29:30.394 --> 29:32.730
But that doesn't mean I'm disappointed.

29:38.152 --> 29:40.905
Don't you ever wonder
what it would be like

29:40.988 --> 29:43.282
if we hadn't rushed into marriage?

29:44.575 --> 29:45.951
Rushed?

29:49.121 --> 29:50.414
I can't believe it.

29:55.544 --> 29:58.422
I married you
because I was madly in love with you.

30:00.007 --> 30:01.175
Me too.

30:03.344 --> 30:04.512
I know, but...

30:05.971 --> 30:11.727
You seem to have settled
for your mediocre school sweetheart.

30:12.311 --> 30:15.105
You're wrong, Óscar.
You aren't being fair.

30:17.024 --> 30:18.817
We were 20 years old.

30:22.154 --> 30:25.574
I hate to think
that the best years of our lives are gone.

30:28.410 --> 30:30.120
I can't fucking believe this, Adriana!

31:04.238 --> 31:07.491
I CAN'T TAKE YOU OUT OF MY MIND.
CAN WE MEET?

31:21.797 --> 31:23.549
Let's groom you, boy.

31:24.466 --> 31:26.093
Good boy!

31:26.176 --> 31:28.178
That's right. Good boy.

31:28.429 --> 31:29.763
Good boy!

31:30.723 --> 31:32.474
You're going to look so cute.

31:32.933 --> 31:35.019
Yes, you're going to look so cute.

31:35.477 --> 31:38.814
A lot of female puppies will fall for you.

31:39.481 --> 31:42.151
You are a good boy, Tadeo.

31:43.652 --> 31:45.029
NO REGRETS

31:48.949 --> 31:51.660
I'LL GO TO THE CONCERT WITH YOU
