[cattle snorting]

00:11.310 --> 00:13.724
[atmospheric music]

00:35.103 --> 00:37.551
[cattle moo]

00:57.862 --> 00:59.206
- Hey Jimmy.

00:59.275 --> 01:01.620
Why don't you ride ahead
and look for the next break?

01:11.172 --> 01:13.344
Tell me about that kid.

01:13.413 --> 01:14.965
- Ah, he's green as the grass.

01:15.034 --> 01:17.758
But he tries hard.
Good kid.

01:17.827 --> 01:21.379
- If he was a good kid he
wouldn't be wearing the brand.

01:21.448 --> 01:22.931
- Yeah, well, he's a favor.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.965
- What about Walker--
he a favor too?

01:26.034 --> 01:28.068
I just to know
what I'm working with.

01:28.137 --> 01:29.482
- They don't work
with you, Kayce.

01:29.551 --> 01:30.965
They work for you.

01:31.034 --> 01:33.000
These are questions you should
be asking your father.

01:33.068 --> 01:34.482
- I'm asking you.

01:34.551 --> 01:36.655
- Yeah well, it ain't
my place to say.

01:36.724 --> 01:39.620
- I guess that says it all.

01:39.689 --> 01:40.655
- Hey Jimmy.

01:40.724 --> 01:42.137
- He said ride the fence line.

01:42.206 --> 01:44.068
- Hey, this cow looks
kinda funny.

01:46.689 --> 01:49.034
[cow moos]

01:49.103 --> 01:51.275
- Shit. Hold on
- Here.

02:03.931 --> 02:05.103
[cow bellows]

02:22.862 --> 02:25.758
- Jimmy. Gimme the Wonder Dust
out of the saddlebag.

02:25.827 --> 02:26.896
- The what kind of dust?

02:26.965 --> 02:28.551
- It's wound dust.

02:28.620 --> 02:29.827
Grab it out of the fucking bag.

02:32.931 --> 02:34.862
[air hissing]

02:38.413 --> 02:39.379
- What's bloat?

02:39.448 --> 02:41.896
- Ate something he shouldn't.

02:41.965 --> 02:44.034
- What the fuck did he bloat on,

02:44.103 --> 02:45.724
the grass is dried
and it didn't freeze last night.

02:45.793 --> 02:47.172
- They can't eat
when it freezes?

02:47.241 --> 02:48.586
- Jimmy, quit askin'
fucking questions.

02:48.655 --> 02:50.793
Go put it back.

02:50.862 --> 02:52.896
Doesn't make any sense, Kayce.

02:52.965 --> 02:54.931
There's no alfalfa
in this field.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.931
- I never seen one
bloat in the fall.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.068
- That's 'cuz they don't.

03:23.241 --> 03:24.896
- Oh, my God...

03:30.413 --> 03:33.206
[theme music]

04:39.551 --> 04:41.310
- I thought we agreed on 10am.

04:41.379 --> 04:42.793
- She's worth the wait.

04:42.862 --> 04:45.000
- I'm breathless
with anticipation.

04:47.551 --> 04:50.793
- Cassidy Reid is here.

04:50.862 --> 04:52.448
- Morning.
- Hi.

04:52.517 --> 04:53.931
- Pleasure.
- The pleasure's mine.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.862
I'm a huge admirer.

04:56.931 --> 04:59.655
- Cassidy.
- Mr. Stewart.

04:59.724 --> 05:02.241
Hi Beth.
- Hi.

05:02.310 --> 05:04.620
- Cassidy Reid.

05:04.689 --> 05:07.034
- Jamie.

05:09.172 --> 05:11.862
- No other opponents
submitted qualified petitions

05:11.931 --> 05:14.275
before the deadline,
which means the office is yours.

05:14.344 --> 05:16.137
AG Stewart will
step down immediately

05:16.206 --> 05:17.413
and I will appoint
you to the office

05:17.482 --> 05:21.344
before the election,
which you run unopposed,

05:21.413 --> 05:23.655
which means--welcome
to the office, AG Reid.

05:23.724 --> 05:24.758
- Thank you, Governor.

05:24.827 --> 05:26.413
I will serve Montana with pride.

05:26.482 --> 05:29.379
And to the letter of the law.

05:29.448 --> 05:31.413
- Yeah...

05:31.482 --> 05:32.689
We'll issue a press release

05:32.758 --> 05:34.241
and schedule
an official swearing in,

05:34.310 --> 05:35.448
on what, Friday?

05:38.206 --> 05:40.517
- Friday's good for me.

05:40.586 --> 05:43.034
- How's Friday for you, Jamie?

05:43.103 --> 05:45.827
- Friday's fine.

05:45.896 --> 05:48.172
[phone buzzes]
Excuse me.

05:48.241 --> 05:50.551
- I think it's a good idea
if I brief you

05:50.620 --> 05:52.724
on some of the more
pressing legal issues

05:52.793 --> 05:55.137
facing the state
prior to the swear-in.

05:55.206 --> 05:56.793
- Alright, let's dive in.

05:56.862 --> 05:59.000
- Okay...

05:59.068 --> 06:02.344
I don't know where to start.

06:02.413 --> 06:04.482
- Dad?

06:04.551 --> 06:07.620
- Excuse me.

06:13.413 --> 06:15.862
- Who died?

06:15.931 --> 06:17.724
- Not who...

06:17.793 --> 06:20.103
[flies buzzing]

06:24.586 --> 06:27.551
- Mister Dutton.

06:27.620 --> 06:29.275
Here's your culprit.

06:37.344 --> 06:39.137
- This is a crime scene.

06:39.206 --> 06:41.896
Jamie.
Get livestock agents out here.

06:41.965 --> 06:44.448
Everyone walk
away from this area.

06:44.517 --> 06:47.413
Brian. You're not a reserve
agent anymore.

06:47.482 --> 06:48.586
You're on regular duty.

06:48.655 --> 06:49.896
You find a way
to cover this area.

06:49.965 --> 06:52.482
I don't want a fuckin' bird
landing in it.

06:52.551 --> 06:55.310
You.
Walk with me.

06:57.551 --> 07:00.172
Now's not the time to talk about
all the fights I'm in.

07:00.241 --> 07:03.310
Right now, this is the only
fight that matters.

07:03.379 --> 07:06.517
- You have any idea
who did this?

07:06.586 --> 07:10.655
- I know exactly who did it.

07:10.724 --> 07:12.172
Now we gotta go prove it...

07:17.241 --> 07:20.896
[chanting and drumming]

07:22.896 --> 07:25.103
- You ever hear
of the Beck brothers?

07:25.172 --> 07:26.172
- The Beck brothers?

07:26.241 --> 07:27.620
- Yeah, the Beck brothers.

07:27.689 --> 07:30.206
- They own about 300 gas
stations with slot machines.

07:30.275 --> 07:33.241
- One of the brothers controls
the sale of liquor licenses.

07:33.310 --> 07:34.413
That could be a real problem.

07:34.482 --> 07:35.689
They don't want
our casino to happen.

07:35.758 --> 07:37.137
- The casino's mine.

07:37.206 --> 07:38.965
And your hotel won't need
their liquor license.

07:39.034 --> 07:40.586
Once we annex the land,

07:40.655 --> 07:42.758
the state has no control
over anything we do.

07:42.827 --> 07:44.793
- We didn't agree
to annexing the land.

07:44.862 --> 07:46.965
- You don't need to--
we own the land now.

07:47.034 --> 07:48.896
That wasn't the deal---

07:48.965 --> 07:50.551
- It's exactly the deal, Dan.

07:50.620 --> 07:53.310
And for you, it's priceless.

07:53.379 --> 07:54.965
There's no county permits
to build.

07:55.034 --> 07:57.275
The gaming license comes from
the Tribal Gaming Commission,

07:57.344 --> 07:58.793
as does your liquor license,

07:58.862 --> 08:01.586
your permit to operate,
and your hotel license...

08:01.655 --> 08:03.103
When you sold me the land, Dan,

08:03.172 --> 08:05.448
I gave you freedom
from oversight.

08:05.517 --> 08:06.551
- Sidestepping those regulations

08:06.620 --> 08:07.862
is going to anger
a lot of people.

08:07.931 --> 08:09.827
That puts him in danger.
Both of you.

08:09.896 --> 08:13.000
- That's why I have Mo.

08:13.068 --> 08:14.655
Who do you have?

08:14.724 --> 08:16.586
Surely you've learned by now--

08:16.655 --> 08:18.758
we're the only ones
playing by the rules.

08:18.827 --> 08:20.689
- What are you saying?
You saying I need security?

08:20.758 --> 08:22.310
- You've needed it
for a while, Dan.

08:22.379 --> 08:24.172
You should've learned that, too.

08:24.241 --> 08:27.241
[chanting and drumming]

08:36.309 --> 08:38.551
- 150 years ago,

08:38.620 --> 08:41.931
our people called
this land home.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.241
We drank from its rivers,

08:44.310 --> 08:46.586
we hunted its valleys,

08:46.655 --> 08:49.413
we cared for our dead
in these forests,

08:49.482 --> 08:52.206
we prayed on these mountains.

08:52.275 --> 08:56.206
This was our home.
And it nourished us.

08:56.275 --> 08:59.000
- You understand our contract
with the reservation

08:59.068 --> 09:02.689
is invalidated the moment
they annex this land.

09:02.758 --> 09:05.655
You familiar with the term
indian giver?

09:05.724 --> 09:07.241
Well this is the opposite.

09:07.310 --> 09:11.103
- The word you're looking for
is justice.

09:11.172 --> 09:13.551
- By the power vested in me,

09:13.620 --> 09:16.241
I hereby claim this land
as property

09:16.310 --> 09:18.551
of the Nation
of Confederated Tribes

09:18.620 --> 09:20.275
at Broken Rock.

09:20.344 --> 09:23.448
[applause]

09:25.344 --> 09:28.103
- If he doesn't keep his word
I lose everything.

09:28.172 --> 09:30.620
- If you were him
would you keep your word?

09:30.689 --> 09:34.310
- It's worth the risk
if he is telling the truth.

09:34.379 --> 09:37.206
- Trusting him
is not a business strategy.

09:37.275 --> 09:38.931
- Dan!

09:39.000 --> 09:40.827
Come do the honors.

09:40.896 --> 09:44.000
- Great, now he's asking you
to dig your own fucking grave.

09:48.275 --> 09:50.965
- This is the beginning of
something very special, Dan.

09:51.034 --> 09:53.724
You watch what
a difference we make.

10:18.172 --> 10:20.413
Any endeavor that raises
my people's profile

10:20.482 --> 10:21.931
is a good one,

10:22.000 --> 10:25.344
but I wonder--
how many casinos do we need?

10:25.413 --> 10:27.310
Is this the right path
for our future?

10:27.379 --> 10:30.137
- Are you challenging
Chairman Rainwater's leadership?

10:30.206 --> 10:31.862
- I'm challenging his outlook,

10:31.931 --> 10:34.000
and what's best
for our people as a whole,

10:34.068 --> 10:36.137
instead of a select few.

10:38.068 --> 10:40.241
- In an historic
ground-breaking ceremony,

10:40.310 --> 10:42.172
Tribal Chairman Thomas
Rainwater

10:42.241 --> 10:43.862
annexed the land purchased

10:43.931 --> 10:45.517
for the Confederated Tribes
of Broken Rock's

10:45.586 --> 10:48.206
ambitious hotel
& casino project

10:48.275 --> 10:49.896
into the reservation.

10:49.965 --> 10:52.241
There are now questions
about what, if any,

10:52.310 --> 10:54.172
authority the state will
have over regulating

10:54.241 --> 10:56.241
the casino or monitoring
the construction

10:56.310 --> 10:59.275
of what will be the largest
hotel in the state.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.379
- Who's the contractor
on this build?

11:06.448 --> 11:08.103
- I'll find out.

11:08.172 --> 11:10.655
- I thought we were pretty
fucking clear with Mr. Jenkins.

11:10.724 --> 11:14.206
- Well evidently not.

11:14.275 --> 11:17.000
- We need to find
a less subtle means

11:17.068 --> 11:20.586
of expressing our displeasure.

11:20.655 --> 11:24.379
Can we bait that trap?

11:27.172 --> 11:30.137
I think it's time we spring it.

11:41.620 --> 11:43.965
- So you think this
was intentional?

11:44.034 --> 11:45.448
I don't see tire
tracks anywhere.

11:45.517 --> 11:48.275
The fence is way over there--
no one threw it over.

11:48.344 --> 11:49.827
And it didn't fall
out of the fucking sky--

11:49.896 --> 11:52.724
- That's exactly what it did.

11:52.793 --> 11:54.862
- So you think someone
flew a plane over here

11:54.931 --> 11:56.413
and dropped clover
on your cattle

11:56.482 --> 11:57.758
in the middle of the night,
John?

11:57.827 --> 11:59.517
Think about that.

11:59.586 --> 12:01.344
- We have.

12:01.413 --> 12:03.241
A King Air designed
for skydiving

12:03.310 --> 12:04.413
so it has a side door
large enough

12:04.482 --> 12:06.379
and could hold the weight.

12:06.448 --> 12:07.413
- Why would anyone
do that, though?

12:07.482 --> 12:08.586
Who would do that?

12:08.655 --> 12:11.655
- Your golfing buddy.
That's who.

12:11.724 --> 12:14.448
- All right, John.
Think that.

12:14.517 --> 12:15.827
Now why the fuck am I here?

12:15.896 --> 12:18.793
I have no jurisdiction.
Cattle is your department.

12:18.862 --> 12:20.206
What can I do for you.

12:20.275 --> 12:22.206
- I have six full-time
agents and four reserves.

12:22.275 --> 12:24.482
I don't have the manpower
for this investigation.

12:24.551 --> 12:26.275
I need your deputies--

12:26.344 --> 12:27.655
- John, I can't
spare any deputies.

12:27.724 --> 12:28.689
County has more firefighters
sleeping at night

12:28.758 --> 12:29.689
than I have on patrol--

12:29.758 --> 12:31.103
- You keep making my point.

12:31.172 --> 12:32.482
You wanna help?

12:32.551 --> 12:34.517
Give me deputies
or deputize my men.

12:34.586 --> 12:35.827
And not in six weeks--
right now.

12:35.896 --> 12:37.034
Right in this field.

12:37.103 --> 12:39.896
- Which men?

12:39.965 --> 12:42.793
- Him for starters.

12:42.862 --> 12:45.034
- John, He put that drifter
on a soup diet

12:45.103 --> 12:47.310
and you want me to license him
to carry a weapon?!

12:47.379 --> 12:49.344
- You mean the one who held
a knife to his throat--

12:49.413 --> 12:51.724
that drifter?

12:51.793 --> 12:53.103
You gonna tell me
that beating was worse

12:53.172 --> 12:56.241
than some of your officers
have doled out? Hmm?

12:59.310 --> 13:01.862
How many times have I stood
on a podium with you, Donnie.

13:01.931 --> 13:04.758
Stood for you.

13:04.827 --> 13:07.137
Think you'd be sheriff
if it weren't for me?

13:09.689 --> 13:10.896
Maybe you haven't noticed,

13:10.965 --> 13:14.827
but there's a war
going on in this valley.

13:14.896 --> 13:16.965
Today's the day
you choose sides.

13:21.655 --> 13:24.103
- I'll issue the permit,
but he's got to understand---

13:24.172 --> 13:25.827
- He's trained to use it.
- That's just great, John.

13:25.896 --> 13:28.517
Now you train him not to use it.

13:28.586 --> 13:30.551
If it comes out of
your holster, son,

13:30.620 --> 13:33.172
you'd better be an ironclad
reason, understood?

13:33.241 --> 13:34.689
- Yeah.

13:38.103 --> 13:39.931
- If he calls dispatch
for support,

13:40.000 --> 13:43.241
I expect you to give it to him.

13:43.310 --> 13:45.517
Did you hear me Donnie?

13:45.586 --> 13:46.758
- I heard you Joh,

13:46.827 --> 13:49.206
The whole goddamn
valley heard you.

13:53.448 --> 13:55.034
- We all know who did this.

13:55.103 --> 13:57.034
You find the evidence.

13:57.103 --> 13:59.827
And when he does,

13:59.896 --> 14:01.241
you drag him by the hair
back to me.

14:12.689 --> 14:15.620
- I think we should ask for
an amendment to the agreement.

14:15.689 --> 14:19.931
Something that--
- That what?

14:20.000 --> 14:22.034
Should he pinky swear
he won't fuck me?

14:27.241 --> 14:29.896
- There's the skydiving
place in Three Forks.

14:29.965 --> 14:32.344
We're headed there now.

14:32.413 --> 14:34.275
And then there's other two

14:34.344 --> 14:35.758
Missoula and Whitefish.

14:35.827 --> 14:36.896
- That's too far.

14:40.758 --> 14:44.793
- Um, you didn't want
to mention the trust?

14:44.862 --> 14:46.034
- Trust who?

14:46.103 --> 14:48.724
- The trust.
The ranch is in a trust.

14:48.793 --> 14:49.965
- It is?

14:50.034 --> 14:51.275
- Yeah, don't play dumb
with me Kayce,

14:51.344 --> 14:52.206
I'm looking at your signature
right here.

14:52.275 --> 14:53.379
- I ain't signed shit.

14:53.448 --> 14:55.586
- [exhales]

14:55.655 --> 14:57.551
All right. Call me when you
get to Three Forks.

15:01.482 --> 15:03.241
- My fucking family, man ...

15:06.517 --> 15:10.068
- Fuck. What the fuck, Beth?

15:22.758 --> 15:24.241
- Hi Jamie, It's Sarah.

15:24.310 --> 15:26.172
I just wanted to confirm
some facts with you--

15:26.241 --> 15:28.448
- Who's Sarah?

15:28.517 --> 15:30.862
Jumpy, jumpy, jumpy.

15:30.931 --> 15:32.586
What's got you so nervous,
I wonder.

15:32.655 --> 15:35.862
- Well, you scared
the fucking shit out of me.

15:35.931 --> 15:39.137
And I'll tell you
what makes me nervous.

15:39.206 --> 15:42.068
This. Why a trust?

15:42.137 --> 15:43.758
- You're an attorney, Jamie.

15:43.827 --> 15:45.379
I shouldn't have
to explain it to you.

15:45.448 --> 15:47.137
- Okay. Why am I not in it?

15:47.206 --> 15:49.517
- Do I really have to tell
you that too, Jamie?

15:49.586 --> 15:51.724
Here's all the things
I don't believe:

15:51.793 --> 15:54.379
I don't believe you're capable
of swallowing your pride

15:54.448 --> 15:56.655
and contributing to this family.

15:56.724 --> 15:59.172
I don't believe our father
will ever trust you again--

15:59.241 --> 16:01.310
which is why I don't believe you
have a role here anymore.

16:01.379 --> 16:04.689
- Oh. You want to know
what my role is?

16:04.758 --> 16:06.793
Well I think you're
putting it in a trust

16:06.862 --> 16:10.310
so you can control the money.
So you can do this.

16:10.379 --> 16:12.620
And this. And this.

16:12.689 --> 16:15.034
- The ranch is an investor, yes.

16:15.103 --> 16:17.310
- How big an investor?

16:17.379 --> 16:18.896
I manage the finances, Beth.

16:18.965 --> 16:21.517
I need to know--
How big?

16:21.586 --> 16:24.344
- Five million.

16:24.413 --> 16:26.275
I know, Jamie.

16:26.344 --> 16:29.379
You're worried about the risk.

16:29.448 --> 16:31.206
Two things: one--

16:31.275 --> 16:32.724
the risk is mitigated;

16:32.793 --> 16:35.068
two--if you didn't have balls
the size of quail eggs,

16:35.137 --> 16:37.172
you would've invested
this money years ago

16:37.241 --> 16:39.620
and he wouldn't be chasing
his fucking tail every fall.

16:39.689 --> 16:42.448
Good work.

16:42.517 --> 16:43.758
- Hey, Beth.

16:43.827 --> 16:45.724
That is over half
the ranch's cash.

16:45.793 --> 16:49.413
What do we do in November
if cattle prices go down?

16:49.482 --> 16:52.068
How much money do you think
this ranch makes a year?

16:52.137 --> 16:54.034
After payroll and
property taxes

16:54.103 --> 16:55.482
and hay and countless
other expenses?!

16:55.551 --> 16:57.482
Nothing.

16:57.551 --> 17:00.068
This ranch has not turned
a profit in six years.

17:00.137 --> 17:01.862
And maybe you don't
understand the impact

17:01.931 --> 17:03.413
of a few hundred dead cattle,

17:03.482 --> 17:06.241
but that's half a million
dollars rotting in the field.

17:06.310 --> 17:07.517
You fucked us.

17:07.586 --> 17:10.172
Fucked us.

17:10.241 --> 17:12.655
I want the ranch out
and I want it out by today.

17:12.723 --> 17:14.137
- It doesn't work
like that, Jamie

17:14.205 --> 17:16.550
- You make it work like that.

17:16.619 --> 17:18.413
- Fuck, now I see.

17:22.172 --> 17:23.792
You Think you're gonna
get him to trust you

17:23.862 --> 17:26.758
by making him not trust me?

17:26.827 --> 17:30.344
I wish you and your bird balls
the best of luck.

17:36.103 --> 17:40.896
[ "Johnny Cash"
by Badd Wolf playing ]

17:46.172 --> 17:48.896
- Afternoon!

17:48.965 --> 17:50.517
- Can I help you?

17:50.586 --> 17:52.137
- Could you get
a message to Jimmy?

17:52.206 --> 17:53.931
- What's the message?

17:54.000 --> 17:56.482
- This.

17:56.551 --> 17:58.137
Piece of shit.

17:58.206 --> 18:00.137
[grunting]

18:09.379 --> 18:11.724
- Tell him I want
my fucking money.

18:11.793 --> 18:13.896
He's got a week.

18:29.931 --> 18:32.379
- How many total?

18:32.448 --> 18:37.172
- So far we've found 360 more.

18:37.241 --> 18:39.517
- Yeah they dropped bales
all the way up the valley.

18:39.586 --> 18:40.758
If we push the heard down here,

18:40.827 --> 18:42.206
they're gonna get
into that clover.

18:42.275 --> 18:44.931
I say we move them up the pass.
Through the mountains.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.896
- That's an awful rough trail.

18:48.862 --> 18:51.275
- Rip's right.

18:51.344 --> 18:54.034
We'll take them over the pass.

18:54.103 --> 18:56.103
That goddamn clover's
gonna take root.

18:56.172 --> 18:59.103
Next spring it'll be worse.

18:59.172 --> 19:02.310
We're gonna have
to burn this field.

19:02.379 --> 19:04.482
- Just gotta be careful we don't
start a fucking forest fire.

19:04.551 --> 19:06.413
- We'll bring up water trucks.

19:06.482 --> 19:08.896
I'll have the fire department
out here, just in case.

19:11.068 --> 19:13.827
I don't see any other way.

19:13.896 --> 19:14.931
Burn it.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.206
- Yes sir.

19:28.482 --> 19:30.379
- Colby.

19:30.448 --> 19:33.172
No horses.

19:34.896 --> 19:36.827
- I hate this fucking thing.

19:43.034 --> 19:44.655
- Rip.

19:46.413 --> 19:49.551
- Who's the hell is that?

19:52.827 --> 19:56.448
- Oh, what the fuck.

19:56.517 --> 19:58.448
- How much do you owe?

20:03.551 --> 20:06.482
How much, Jimmy?

20:06.551 --> 20:08.793
- Around eight thousand.

20:08.862 --> 20:11.275
- I ain't got it.

20:11.344 --> 20:13.793
I know you don't.

20:13.862 --> 20:17.068
- I'll get it.

20:17.137 --> 20:20.103
- They said a week.

20:20.172 --> 20:23.793
Or I get this again.

20:23.862 --> 20:27.206
- I'll get it.

20:34.448 --> 20:37.551
- Cause of what we did,
they beat him?

20:39.793 --> 20:41.793
- No, they beat him
for what I did.

20:45.965 --> 20:48.413
- Has anyone heard
the term " ocean water"?

20:50.551 --> 20:53.000
It's a mixture
of Lysol and water.

20:53.068 --> 20:55.482
Yeah, Genevieve.
- What do you do with it?

20:55.551 --> 20:57.172
- You drink it.

20:57.241 --> 20:58.586
- Why?

20:58.655 --> 21:01.310
- Because alcohol is illegal
on the reservation.

21:01.379 --> 21:03.310
Because it's cheap.

21:03.379 --> 21:05.103
Because when people's
lives are miserable,

21:05.172 --> 21:08.689
they seek ways
to escape the pain.

21:08.758 --> 21:10.068
Ocean water is one way.

21:10.137 --> 21:12.689
It's a temporary escape.

21:12.758 --> 21:14.586
With painful repercussions.

21:14.655 --> 21:17.000
But when the misery's
bad enough,

21:17.068 --> 21:19.482
tomorrow is rarely
factored into decisions.

21:23.275 --> 21:27.103
Uh, so think of yourselves
as Sherlock Holmes.

21:27.172 --> 21:30.620
And your job is
to investigate the past,

21:30.689 --> 21:33.068
to understand the present.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.206
[knock on door]

21:56.896 --> 22:00.034
- Can I help you?

22:00.103 --> 22:01.793
- Looking for John Dutton---

22:01.862 --> 22:04.034
Yeah who's looking
for John Dutton?

22:04.103 --> 22:05.586
We don't know you.

22:05.655 --> 22:09.068
- What the fuck
is this guy up to ...

22:09.137 --> 22:10.931
- Hey, step back.

22:17.827 --> 22:20.172
Hey!

22:20.241 --> 22:21.793
- Come on motherfucker,
shoot me.

22:26.724 --> 22:27.862
Drop your weapon!

22:27.931 --> 22:29.517
You're fucking right.
Put it down.

22:40.896 --> 22:43.068
- Oh fuck. Shit.

22:44.379 --> 22:46.793
- Mister Dutton,

22:46.862 --> 22:49.689
seems all the stories
I've heard are true.

22:49.758 --> 22:50.862
- Put it down, whoah.

22:50.931 --> 22:53.241
Whoah, everybody calm down.

22:53.310 --> 22:55.655
Dad. This is--
- Malcolm Beck.

22:55.724 --> 22:59.310
This here is my brother, Teal.

22:59.379 --> 23:01.000
I apologize for everything
that's happened here.

23:01.068 --> 23:04.103
Misunderstandings aside,
we need to speak.

23:04.172 --> 23:06.965
Seems there's a problem
that we share.

23:07.034 --> 23:08.931
- My problems
are squarely my own.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.586
- Not this one.

23:11.655 --> 23:13.034
May we sit?

23:15.517 --> 23:17.413
We can talk under that tree.

23:17.482 --> 23:20.620
- Uh-huh.

23:27.172 --> 23:28.827
- What in the Sam-Hell
was that about?

23:28.896 --> 23:31.206
- I'm sorry.
They called fifteen minutes ago

23:31.275 --> 23:33.034
I didn't know
they meant now.

23:33.103 --> 23:35.448
- I'm taking this meeting alone.

23:37.482 --> 23:38.586
I said alone, Jamie.

23:47.931 --> 23:49.482
- Don't you want to have
your lawyer present?

23:49.551 --> 23:53.931
- This don't feel like
a lawyer meeting.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.310
- I saw your son go against
Peabody Coal before the Senate.

23:57.379 --> 23:59.137
He's one hell of a litigator.

23:59.206 --> 24:00.896
- Yeah, he can argue
with the best of them.

24:00.965 --> 24:04.551
So, what's this problem?

24:04.620 --> 24:06.379
- A casino in this valley

24:06.448 --> 24:08.137
will have a negative affect
on our business.

24:08.206 --> 24:10.517
And for your ranch
and the others.

24:10.586 --> 24:12.965
- In five years,
how many ranches like this

24:13.034 --> 24:14.965
can afford to exist?

24:15.034 --> 24:16.827
- Wanna hear our guess.

24:16.896 --> 24:18.724
Soon as that casino opens,

24:18.793 --> 24:21.103
they'll approach the Forest
Service about a land lease.

24:21.172 --> 24:23.758
And they'll build a ski resort.

24:23.827 --> 24:25.034
- And you know
as well as anyone,

24:25.103 --> 24:27.827
ski resorts are daggers
to the heart

24:27.896 --> 24:29.275
for places like this.

24:29.344 --> 24:31.413
- It'll be an ocean of second
homes in ten years.

24:31.482 --> 24:32.689
- I'm aware.

24:32.758 --> 24:34.655
- I'm sure you are.

24:34.724 --> 24:36.689
Look, my office has no authority

24:36.758 --> 24:38.344
over an Indian casino.

24:38.413 --> 24:40.137
- And yours has no authority
over the land.

24:40.206 --> 24:43.620
And your new AG
can't restrict them.

24:43.689 --> 24:46.551
That's why we need to fight
this outside the lines.

24:46.620 --> 24:48.689
We just don't think they have
the stomach for that.

24:48.758 --> 24:51.931
- Yeah, well they have
the stomach for it.

24:54.551 --> 24:57.068
I don't need partners, fellas.

24:57.137 --> 24:59.586
- Dan Jenkins has a partner.

24:59.655 --> 25:00.827
A big one.

25:00.896 --> 25:04.172
- Think of us as allies.

25:04.241 --> 25:07.413
We'd be the perfect allies
for each other, John.

25:07.482 --> 25:09.551
Because there is no part of your
business that benefits ours.

25:09.620 --> 25:11.068
And vice versa.

25:11.137 --> 25:13.965
- And when we fight,
it's a zero-sum game.

25:14.034 --> 25:17.655
We will win.
At any cost.

25:17.724 --> 25:20.379
- Yeah.

25:20.448 --> 25:22.413
- John...

25:22.482 --> 25:23.793
We just want you to consider it.

25:23.862 --> 25:26.724
- I consider every option,
Malcolm.

25:26.793 --> 25:29.068
And I choose the one
that's best for my family.

25:29.137 --> 25:33.241
If it helps you,
it's a coincidence.

25:39.965 --> 25:42.034
- That's not the way
you wear one of those.

26:03.586 --> 26:06.310
- Working with them is a deal
with the devil, Dad.

26:07.586 --> 26:10.758
- All the angels are gone, son.

26:10.827 --> 26:14.275
There's only devils left.

26:14.344 --> 26:16.103
At least they admit it.

26:23.310 --> 26:25.241
- I'm impressed.

26:25.310 --> 26:27.241
You're really preaching.
That's good.

26:27.310 --> 26:29.172
- Brushing up on your history?

26:29.241 --> 26:31.413
- Just curious.
Wanted to see you teach.

26:31.482 --> 26:33.275
Glad I did.

26:33.344 --> 26:34.896
Be careful, though.

26:34.965 --> 26:37.655
If you only teach the tragedy,
they'll just see us as tragic.

26:37.724 --> 26:39.517
You should show them
the culture.

26:39.586 --> 26:41.655
Show them what
we're fighting for.

26:41.724 --> 26:43.206
- And how do I do that.

26:43.275 --> 26:44.275
- I dunno. Field trip, maybe?

26:44.344 --> 26:45.551
Bring 'em out to the rez.

26:45.620 --> 26:48.310
Everyone's getting ready
for the relay races.

26:48.379 --> 26:50.137
Can you think of a better way
to show them who we are?

26:50.206 --> 26:52.448
- That's a really great idea,
I'll um...

26:52.517 --> 26:54.275
I'll talk to my administrator.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.241
- Your rehab's in fifteen.

26:57.310 --> 26:59.206
Feel up to walking
to the rec center?

26:59.275 --> 27:02.000
- Um, I-I can't.

27:02.068 --> 27:03.931
I've got a faculty meeting.

27:04.000 --> 27:08.206
I'll just call you
and reschedule, okay?

27:08.275 --> 27:11.103
- Okay, Monica.

27:21.275 --> 27:23.448
No telling where that
son of a bitch got a plane.

27:23.517 --> 27:25.103
Not from skydivers.

27:25.172 --> 27:26.413
- We're never going
to find it this way.

27:26.482 --> 27:28.551
He's smarter than that.

27:28.620 --> 27:30.068
[phone buzzes]

27:33.827 --> 27:35.034
Pull over, would you?

27:45.931 --> 27:48.172
- Hey.

27:48.241 --> 27:50.551
How are you?

27:50.620 --> 27:52.206
- I'm lonely, Kayce.

27:52.275 --> 27:54.379
- I can solve that problem.

27:54.448 --> 27:56.965
- [laughs]

27:57.034 --> 27:59.551
I miss you.

27:59.620 --> 28:01.620
- Yeah, I miss you too.

28:01.689 --> 28:05.758
- You...want me to come over?

28:07.000 --> 28:10.137
- Yeah.

28:10.206 --> 28:11.827
But you can't. I just--

28:11.896 --> 28:15.034
Just wanted to hear your voice.

28:15.103 --> 28:17.344
- I love you, Monica.

28:17.413 --> 28:19.448
- God, I wish
that was all it took.

28:32.586 --> 28:34.310
- Everything alright?

28:34.379 --> 28:36.896
- Nope.

28:55.862 --> 28:58.000
- The first thing we want
you to look into.

28:58.068 --> 29:01.724
is this Paradise Valley
Development Corporation.

29:01.793 --> 29:04.068
- They've sold property
to the Broken Rock Tribe,

29:04.137 --> 29:07.172
which is attempting to annex it
into the reservation.

29:07.241 --> 29:09.379
We'd like you to file
an injunction against it--

29:09.448 --> 29:11.241
- Can we contest that?

29:11.310 --> 29:13.965
- I mean they're clearly attempt
to avoid state tax obligations

29:14.034 --> 29:16.620
and regulatory requirements.
I'd say we have a good chance.

29:16.689 --> 29:19.206
- What about this Senate hearing
regarding jurisdiction

29:19.275 --> 29:21.724
violation by the Livestock
Association?

29:21.793 --> 29:24.034
- Let me ask you a question,
Attorney General-elect.

29:24.103 --> 29:26.103
Do you find Jamie's
knowledge of the raid

29:26.172 --> 29:29.000
prior to it happening
inculpatory in any way?

29:29.068 --> 29:32.620
I'm concerned what happens
if they ask him to testify.

29:35.689 --> 29:37.034
- Umm.

29:37.103 --> 29:40.137
I think attorney-client
privileges recuse of him.

29:40.206 --> 29:42.137
- Even if he's aware of a crime
before it's happened.

29:42.206 --> 29:44.758
- Are you saying a crime was
committed intentionally?

29:44.827 --> 29:48.310
- There was no crime.

29:49.413 --> 29:52.793
Not the time.
Not the place.

29:52.862 --> 29:54.379
- The concern is...

29:54.448 --> 29:55.689
the negative press
surrounding the hearing

29:55.758 --> 29:57.586
can create a ripple effect--

29:57.655 --> 29:59.586
emboldening others to come
forward with accusations

29:59.655 --> 30:01.758
that may hold legal merit.

30:01.827 --> 30:03.793
Our goal should be to avoid
a hearing altogether.

30:03.862 --> 30:05.068
- How do you plan to do that?

30:05.137 --> 30:06.965
- I'm working on it,
Commissioner.

30:10.551 --> 30:11.862
- Feels like suppertime.

30:11.931 --> 30:16.586
Cassidy, would you
care to join us?

30:16.655 --> 30:18.793
- Oh, no I--
- We insist.

30:23.137 --> 30:24.344
- I'll show you the way.

30:24.413 --> 30:26.068
- Okay, thanks.

30:32.034 --> 30:34.379
- Sharp as a tack, that one.

30:34.448 --> 30:35.896
And what a looker.

30:35.965 --> 30:39.413
My God. She's going to make
a great Attorney General.

30:39.482 --> 30:42.413
- What the fuck are you doing?

30:42.482 --> 30:43.724
- I'm going to get
you disbarred,

30:43.793 --> 30:47.172
you spineless piece of shit.

30:47.241 --> 30:48.931
You should never have come home.

30:50.896 --> 30:54.137
- You told me to come home.

30:54.206 --> 30:56.862
- Why on Earth
would you ever listen to me?

31:04.137 --> 31:06.034
- That's fine, thank you.

31:07.931 --> 31:11.206
That's Kayce's seat, Cassidy.

31:11.275 --> 31:13.413
- Oh, I'm sorry.

31:13.482 --> 31:14.793
- It's fine. That one's fine.

31:14.862 --> 31:16.482
- Okay.

31:31.310 --> 31:32.413
- Don't you fuckin' dare.

31:38.862 --> 31:40.517
Here, come sit next to me.

31:45.241 --> 31:47.172
- Have a seat, son.

31:49.034 --> 31:51.206
Kayce's not back
from Three Forks.

31:51.275 --> 31:52.586
- I thought he was.

31:52.655 --> 31:55.000
- Well how'd that go?

31:55.068 --> 31:57.000
- There was nothing there.

31:59.310 --> 32:01.793
- So your family's
from Great Falls, right?

32:01.862 --> 32:03.482
- Yeah, the ranch
is outside Lewiston.

32:03.551 --> 32:05.275
Near Roundup,
know where that is?

32:05.344 --> 32:06.448
- I do.

32:12.896 --> 32:14.068
- Excuse me. I'm sorry.

32:21.034 --> 32:23.241
- Is he okay?

32:23.310 --> 32:26.517
- He has Celiac Disease.

32:26.586 --> 32:28.586
He gets an upset tummy.

32:31.448 --> 32:33.103
- He has what??

32:48.586 --> 32:51.448
[breathing deeply]

33:05.275 --> 33:06.793
[knock on door]

33:56.896 --> 33:58.068
- Mama?

34:00.620 --> 34:03.655
- Hey buddy.
- Daddy!

34:33.344 --> 34:36.793
- We've checked every manifest
in every airstrip in the county.

34:36.862 --> 34:38.655
Sweetgrass, too--
nothing.

34:38.724 --> 34:41.965
- He got that plane from
somewhere, you go find it.

34:42.034 --> 34:43.862
You'll be riding with
Agent Hendon Today.

34:43.931 --> 34:47.068
He knows the job.
Learn from him.

34:47.137 --> 34:48.241
- You don't need
help around here?

34:48.310 --> 34:49.724
- Just find the planes, son.

34:54.344 --> 34:57.275
- Kayce.

34:57.344 --> 34:58.965
If you find anything,
don't confront anyone.

34:59.034 --> 35:00.827
You call the sheriff for backup.

35:00.896 --> 35:03.206
Everything by the book.

35:03.275 --> 35:04.551
- I don't know the book.

35:04.620 --> 35:06.862
- Well that's why you
call the sheriff, son.

35:06.931 --> 35:08.068
It's their book.

35:26.448 --> 35:27.586
- When did all this burn?

35:27.655 --> 35:30.827
- Last year.
- Was it lightning?

35:30.896 --> 35:34.931
- A satellite fell
out of the sky.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.068
- God sure finds
interesting ways

35:37.137 --> 35:39.103
to put people out of business.

35:39.172 --> 35:40.896
- 108, there's
a depredation report,

35:40.965 --> 35:43.689
at the Paulson Ranch
near Ennis. Can we divert?

35:43.758 --> 35:45.448
- Copy that.

35:45.517 --> 35:46.965
It's on the way.
We're en route.

35:47.034 --> 35:48.586
- We're supposed
to be checking airstrips

35:48.655 --> 35:50.172
not dead cows.

35:50.241 --> 35:52.586
- We're checking airstrips
because of dead cows.

35:52.655 --> 35:55.344
Paulson's cows ain't
any less dead than yours.

36:02.379 --> 36:04.655
- Put a wire in
to keep them from coming back

36:04.724 --> 36:06.896
and eating all the evidence.

36:06.965 --> 36:09.310
But then there's the eagles.

36:09.379 --> 36:12.344
Haven't figured out
how to keep them away.

36:12.413 --> 36:15.758
- Oh yeah. Mm.

36:15.827 --> 36:18.310
Mm-hm.

36:18.379 --> 36:19.379
Whew.

36:25.206 --> 36:27.034
- Tell me that ain't wolves.

36:30.482 --> 36:31.827
- You called Fish & Wildlife?

36:31.896 --> 36:33.586
- Hell, they ain't coming.

36:33.655 --> 36:37.482
Jerry Hayes, he's got
the lease next mine.

36:37.551 --> 36:39.344
That thief.

36:39.413 --> 36:41.172
Every time he has a cow die

36:41.241 --> 36:44.068
he hacks 'em up
and blames wolves.

36:44.137 --> 36:46.896
Now we actually have
wolves running around

36:46.965 --> 36:49.931
and he's cried wolf so much
they ain't never gonna come out.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.586
- You know Jerry Hayes?
- Uh-uh.

36:51.655 --> 36:53.034
- He's not worth knowing.

36:53.103 --> 36:56.206
- That's $1,800
I can't stand to lose.

36:56.275 --> 36:58.310
- We can get you compensated,

36:58.379 --> 37:02.793
but Fish & Wildlife has
to issue depredation tags.

37:02.862 --> 37:04.413
I'd have some cowboys
cover your herd for you.

37:04.482 --> 37:06.724
- Ain't got cowboys.
All I got is me.

37:06.793 --> 37:08.482
- Okay, well,

37:08.551 --> 37:10.827
Looks like you're sleeping
outside for a while then.

37:10.896 --> 37:13.379
Dispatch.
- Go ahead.

37:13.448 --> 37:15.827
Have Polk County file a case...

37:15.896 --> 37:18.448
- What you do is rent
you a couple of mules.

37:18.517 --> 37:21.551
Turn em out with the herd.
It's what we do.

37:21.620 --> 37:23.034
- What kind of mules?

37:23.103 --> 37:26.413
- Mean ones.

37:26.482 --> 37:28.448
- Thanks.

37:34.034 --> 37:36.241
[eagle cries]

37:43.034 --> 37:45.241
- Let's just forget this.

37:45.310 --> 37:46.689
You have two calls
in to them already man,

37:46.758 --> 37:48.655
We got things to do
and this ain't one of 'em.

37:48.724 --> 37:51.310
- Dispatch, what's the 20
on sheriff's deputies?

37:51.379 --> 37:52.827
Goddamnit.

37:52.896 --> 37:55.137
- Sheriff's department
says no units available.

37:55.206 --> 37:56.551
- I mean it, man.
Let's forget this.

37:56.620 --> 37:57.931
- Hey. This is the job.

38:09.379 --> 38:10.379
- What do you want?

38:10.448 --> 38:11.896
- Heard you lost
a cow to wolves.

38:11.965 --> 38:13.206
- Heard from who?

38:13.275 --> 38:15.275
- May we see it?

38:15.344 --> 38:17.241
- Fish & Wildlife
already saw it.

38:17.310 --> 38:18.862
- That's not what he asked.
- I'll handle this.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.551
- Where the fuck
are you going?

38:42.758 --> 38:44.827
- Jerry, just hold
up here a second.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.965
- Found your wolf.

39:09.068 --> 39:10.655
- Hey Jerry.

39:10.724 --> 39:13.482
I've been waiting
a long time to say this:

39:13.551 --> 39:15.448
but you're under arrest.

39:15.517 --> 39:17.000
So I want you to turn around
and put your hands

39:17.068 --> 39:18.275
above your head and I want
you to do it now.

39:23.344 --> 39:25.379
Jerry.

39:25.448 --> 39:27.000
Jerry! Stop!

39:28.931 --> 39:30.758
- Ahhhh!

39:30.827 --> 39:33.310
- Jerry!

39:33.379 --> 39:34.344
- Is this necessary?

39:34.413 --> 39:35.379
- He's resisting.

39:35.448 --> 39:37.137
- Ahhhh!

39:37.206 --> 39:38.137
- Let him fucking go now.

39:38.206 --> 39:40.103
- Whoa, whoa. Easy.

39:40.172 --> 39:41.275
Easy, whoa, whoa.

39:41.344 --> 39:42.620
Calm down. Everybody stop.

39:42.689 --> 39:44.655
Listen to me.

39:45.862 --> 39:48.931
- Your dad is gonna
go to county jail.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.758
they'll take his fingerprints
they're gonna take his picture,

39:51.827 --> 39:54.793
and then then let him go.

39:54.862 --> 39:57.379
In six months from now
he's gonna stand before a judge,

39:57.448 --> 39:58.862
who makes him pay a fine

39:58.931 --> 40:03.000
and then pick up trash
on the weekend.

40:03.068 --> 40:04.724
Is it worth
killing us over that?

40:08.172 --> 40:09.931
Look at me.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.137
Does that seem fair to you.

40:12.206 --> 40:15.275
- Luke...

40:15.344 --> 40:16.655
- Put it down.
- Hey, no.

40:16.724 --> 40:18.068
- Down, put it down!

40:18.137 --> 40:19.137
- I got it under control.

40:19.206 --> 40:22.586
- Drop! Drop drop!

40:22.655 --> 40:24.103
- Shit.

40:24.172 --> 40:25.862
- Nooo!

40:28.517 --> 40:29.689
- God.

40:29.758 --> 40:30.896
- I had no choice.

40:30.965 --> 40:32.551
- Yeah you keep
telling yourself that.

40:32.620 --> 40:34.586
- Goddamnit!

40:34.655 --> 40:36.172
You had a choice.

40:36.241 --> 40:39.000
- [sobbing]

40:40.551 --> 40:42.758
- Goddamnit.

41:05.517 --> 41:08.896
[phone buzzes]

41:08.965 --> 41:10.103
- Yeah?

41:13.517 --> 41:15.241
What?

41:40.862 --> 41:42.965
- Who pulled the trigger?

41:43.034 --> 41:45.620
- I don't have a gun.

41:45.689 --> 41:48.586
- Not what I asked.

41:48.655 --> 41:50.931
- It wasn't me.

41:57.620 --> 41:59.827
- Was it justified?

41:59.896 --> 42:03.413
- He's got a freaked out kid
pointing a shotgun at him.

42:03.482 --> 42:07.827
Yeah, it was justified.

42:07.896 --> 42:10.896
But was it right?

42:10.965 --> 42:12.724
Right and wrong is
so far from this place,

42:12.793 --> 42:14.413
I don't think it
factors in at all.

42:20.034 --> 42:21.655
- I told you to call
the sheriff for backup--

42:21.724 --> 42:23.137
- We did, sir.

42:23.206 --> 42:25.551
We did multiple times.

42:25.620 --> 42:28.137
The requests were denied.

42:28.206 --> 42:29.448
But it was still my call.

42:31.379 --> 42:33.000
- My god.

42:37.206 --> 42:39.482
There's no good choices in
a situation like this, Steve.

42:43.448 --> 42:44.793
- What did I say, John?

42:44.862 --> 42:47.206
One fucking day on patrol.
One day--

42:50.379 --> 42:52.413
- You gave me your word, Donnie.
And you broke it.

42:52.482 --> 42:54.517
- All this over a cow,
a fucking cow, John?

42:54.586 --> 42:55.827
A fucking cow.

42:55.896 --> 42:57.689
- It's not over a fucking cow.

42:57.758 --> 42:59.827
It's over you not giving backup.

42:59.896 --> 43:01.586
You denied the request.

43:06.620 --> 43:08.793
Jesus Christ.

43:08.862 --> 43:10.827
A show of force
would have maybe

43:10.896 --> 43:12.137
changed this whole
fucking thing.

43:14.551 --> 43:16.758
So you want to blame somebody?

43:16.827 --> 43:19.000
The you blame yourself,
you son of a bitch.

43:26.758 --> 43:28.827
- According to the
livestock commissioner,

43:28.896 --> 43:30.827
