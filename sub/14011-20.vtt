00:02.036 --> 00:06.005
<i> by two separate</i>
<i> yet equally important groups:</i>

00:06.007 --> 00:08.007
<i> the police,</i>
<i> who investigate crime</i>

00:08.009 --> 00:10.342
<i> and the district attorneys</i>
<i> who prosecute the offenders.</i>

00:10.344 --> 00:13.045
<i> These are their stories.</i>

00:24.225 --> 00:26.191
Well...

00:26.193 --> 00:28.327
Well, what?
They're late.

00:28.329 --> 00:31.597
When you deal with Feds, you
know it's gonna get screwed up.

00:31.599 --> 00:34.433
Hey, Roberts,
what's your guy in for?

00:34.435 --> 00:36.268
gun running...
Drug smuggling,

00:36.270 --> 00:37.853
He's Lebanese.

00:37.854 --> 00:39.437
He brings the drugs in,
he takes the guns out.

00:39.440 --> 00:40.606
Sometimes it's
the other way around.

00:40.608 --> 00:42.041
He's an entrepreneur.

00:42.043 --> 00:43.242
Great.

00:43.244 --> 00:45.277
How do you know
he's going to sing?

00:45.279 --> 00:48.480
We got six months of footwork
hanging on his testimony.

00:48.482 --> 00:51.583
We got the D.E.A. to go to bat
with the U.S. Attorney.

00:51.585 --> 00:53.318
He can't wait to play canary.

00:53.320 --> 00:54.386
Mine's innocent.

00:54.388 --> 00:55.354
(<i> laughing</i> )

00:55.356 --> 00:57.556
Yeah. Right.

00:57.558 --> 01:00.826
Yeah. Mr. O'Connell says
he's a political prisoner

01:00.828 --> 01:03.262
unfairly held without trial.

01:03.264 --> 01:06.131
Ours claims he's persecuted
because he's Cuban.

01:06.133 --> 01:08.100
The mick says it's
because he's Irish

01:08.102 --> 01:11.070
and belongs
to the I.R.A.

01:11.072 --> 01:14.106
They should send them back
where they come from.

01:14.108 --> 01:16.108
GREEVEY:
What about
I-talians, Damato?

01:16.110 --> 01:18.077
I-talians is different.

01:20.314 --> 01:22.347
(<i> horn honking</i> )

01:32.626 --> 01:34.293
Gentlemen.

01:34.295 --> 01:36.328
Oh, after you, Max.

01:45.106 --> 01:46.538
Hey, Roberts...

01:46.540 --> 01:50.476
Looks like your entrepreneur
just went into Chapter 11.

01:50.478 --> 01:52.311
What the hell
happened here?

02:04.325 --> 02:08.427
   Captioning sponsored by
   NBC/UNIVERSAL

03:25.973 --> 03:27.673
LOGAN:
from the side.

03:27.675 --> 03:30.676
Get a wide shot
of the three of them.

03:30.678 --> 03:32.477
Smile, fellas.

03:46.327 --> 03:48.427
Who's in charge?

03:48.429 --> 03:50.429
I'm senior.
Detective Sergeant Max Greevey.

03:50.431 --> 03:53.298
Special Agent Axelrod.
What the hell happened?

03:53.300 --> 03:55.300
Three guys shackled together.

03:55.302 --> 03:57.269
One of them's dead.

03:57.271 --> 03:58.604
Houdini routine.

03:58.606 --> 04:00.672
The two other guys
never saw a thing.

04:03.277 --> 04:05.410
Just what
I freaking needed today.

04:10.017 --> 04:14.019
Let's get you Sherlock Holmeses
down to the Federal building.

04:14.021 --> 04:15.420
Whoa!

04:15.422 --> 04:16.488
Why's that?

04:16.490 --> 04:18.607
Why's that?

04:18.608 --> 04:20.725
Because a Federal prisoner
is dead, that's why.

04:20.728 --> 04:22.427
And that makes it our case.

04:22.429 --> 04:23.962
Doesn't play that way.

04:23.964 --> 04:26.398
They signed all three of them
over to us

04:26.400 --> 04:28.533
at the Federal Detention Center.

04:28.535 --> 04:30.435
Our prisoners, our case.

04:30.437 --> 04:31.603
Show him the paperwork.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.505
Worthless bag of crap!

04:33.507 --> 04:36.375
Six months I put in
on this case! Six months!

04:36.377 --> 04:38.343
Look, gentlemen,
all we want to know

04:38.345 --> 04:39.678
is who's responsible.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.980
I'd say it's either
Montez or O'Connell.

04:41.982 --> 04:43.649
ROBERTS:
I'll find out.

04:43.651 --> 04:46.351
Give me ten minutes
alone with these jerks.

04:46.353 --> 04:48.053
I'll pound it out
of them.

04:48.055 --> 04:50.055
Hey! Roberts, thanks anyway.

04:50.057 --> 04:52.457
We'll beat our own prisoners.

04:52.459 --> 04:55.460
What I meant was
whose jurisdiction are we in?

04:55.462 --> 04:56.561
N.Y.P.D.'S.

04:56.563 --> 04:57.796
AXELROD:
Fine.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.598
You get the stiff.

04:59.600 --> 05:02.301
They're back in Federal custody
as of now.

05:02.303 --> 05:03.402
DAMATO:
Wait a second.

05:03.404 --> 05:04.803
I got signed paperwork.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.371
I need O'Connell.

05:06.373 --> 05:08.774
I got six Westies
upstairs on trial.

05:08.776 --> 05:10.409
O'Connell's IRA.

05:10.411 --> 05:12.644
Why do you need him
for a case against the Westies?

05:12.646 --> 05:14.313
What difference
does it make?

05:14.315 --> 05:16.332
He's been subpoenaed.

05:16.333 --> 05:18.350
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
I think we need to prioritize.

05:18.352 --> 05:19.618
Prioritize, my ass!

05:19.620 --> 05:21.386
I'm senior on the scene.

05:21.388 --> 05:22.554
It's my homicide.

05:22.556 --> 05:24.456
I got a witness to interview.

05:24.458 --> 05:26.458
I have an investigation
to start.

05:26.460 --> 05:28.527
This is ridiculous.
You do what you want.

05:28.529 --> 05:30.495
I'm taking
these Federal prisoners

05:30.497 --> 05:34.366
back to the Federal
Detention Center now!

05:37.571 --> 05:42.507
You just let the feebs waltz off
with two homicide suspects?

05:42.509 --> 05:45.110
What, you think wee should have
had a shoot-out over them?

05:45.112 --> 05:46.778
The F.B.I.
has no right

05:46.780 --> 05:49.414
to interfere with
a homicide investigation!

05:49.416 --> 05:50.749
They are Federal
prisoners, Captain.

05:50.751 --> 05:52.117
Signed over to us.

05:52.119 --> 05:53.385
They had no jurisdiction.

05:53.387 --> 05:55.087
You have any idea

05:55.088 --> 05:56.788
what this investigation
is gonna be like now?

05:56.790 --> 05:58.123
What's the problem?

05:58.125 --> 05:59.424
They're gonna
want to close this.

05:59.426 --> 06:00.659
What's the problem?

06:00.661 --> 06:02.461
He's never worked a case

06:02.463 --> 06:03.662
with the "G" before?

06:03.664 --> 06:05.097
They don't cooperate.

06:05.099 --> 06:06.765
They think
they're God almighty.

06:06.767 --> 06:08.433
A case with Federal prisoners
involved?

06:08.435 --> 06:10.802
Every time you even want
to see one of them

06:10.804 --> 06:13.105
you got to see the
superintendent to the facility,

06:13.107 --> 06:15.607
genuflect going in,
coming out of his office.

06:15.609 --> 06:18.477
I want this thing wrapped up
fast, like yesterday.

06:18.479 --> 06:20.679
What gives, Montez?

06:20.681 --> 06:23.815
You spoke English
just fine last week.

06:23.817 --> 06:25.784
<i> No comprende.</i>

06:29.123 --> 06:33.158
<i> Yo sabe que muerto...</i>

06:33.160 --> 06:35.427
<i> uh, que muerto Mustafa?</i>

06:35.429 --> 06:36.695
<i>Tu?</i>

06:36.697 --> 06:39.531
<i> No, yo sabe o yo muerto?</i>

06:41.602 --> 06:45.904
<i> Tu sabes o tu muertes?</i>

06:45.906 --> 06:48.140
Where's the damn interpreter?

06:48.142 --> 06:50.709
I think<i> yo</i> means "I."

06:50.711 --> 06:54.646
You're saying,
"I killed Mustafa."

06:54.648 --> 06:56.515
Then you do it.

06:56.517 --> 06:58.150
<i> No, tu.</i>

07:02.723 --> 07:04.523
WOMAN:
Having trouble?

07:04.525 --> 07:07.793
He's in culture shock.

07:07.795 --> 07:09.528
<i> Y como esta?</i>

07:09.530 --> 07:12.564
<i> No es mi culpa.</i>

07:12.566 --> 07:14.533
He says he's not guilty.

07:14.535 --> 07:16.568
Of course.
Tell him we believe him.

07:16.570 --> 07:18.470
<i> Mi abogado.</i>

07:18.472 --> 07:21.640
<i> Porque no esta escuchando.</i>

07:21.642 --> 07:24.609
<i>Besame todo el cuerpo.</i>

07:24.611 --> 07:26.178
Well..?

07:26.180 --> 07:28.180
You don't want to know

07:28.182 --> 07:32.617
but basically he's not talking
until his lawyer gets here.

07:32.619 --> 07:35.554
Let's try the mick.

07:35.556 --> 07:38.557
Sure, we had a couple of Logans
down dingle way.

07:38.559 --> 07:41.927
One had the pub,
the other the funeral parlor.

07:41.929 --> 07:43.662
That about covers it.

07:43.664 --> 07:45.897
O'CONNELL:
Staunch Republicans,
the Logans--

07:45.899 --> 07:48.600
they fought for
the Republic of Ireland.

07:48.602 --> 07:51.870
Not like your Republicans
in America.

07:51.872 --> 07:54.573
About the dead Arab..?

07:54.575 --> 07:57.709
There's some Greeveys
in County Mayo.

07:57.711 --> 08:00.479
Where's your family from,
Sergeant?

08:00.481 --> 08:01.680
Hell's Kitchen.

08:01.682 --> 08:04.133
Ah.

08:04.134 --> 08:06.585
Well, at least your partner
knows his history.

08:06.587 --> 08:11.223
See if you can cover
some recent history, okay, Mike?

08:13.660 --> 08:14.993
No?

08:14.995 --> 08:16.495
That's what I said, Sergeant.

08:16.497 --> 08:17.596
I gave you permission

08:17.598 --> 08:18.697
to interview Montez
and O'Connell,

08:18.699 --> 08:19.865
not the other prisoners.

08:19.867 --> 08:21.566
Let me get this straight.

08:21.568 --> 08:22.868
You're telling me
to investigate a homicide

08:22.870 --> 08:24.870
without interviewing witnesses?

08:24.872 --> 08:27.506
There were only two witnesses,
Montez and O'Connell.

08:27.508 --> 08:28.907
Character witnesses
then--

08:28.909 --> 08:31.543
guys who might have
heard something.

08:31.545 --> 08:32.611
What is this?
What is this?

08:32.613 --> 08:34.880
This is non-cooperation,
Sergeant.

08:34.882 --> 08:38.283
What the hell is going on?

08:38.285 --> 08:40.552
It's a political hand grenade.

08:40.554 --> 08:43.522
What do you know
about extradition law?

08:43.524 --> 08:44.956
Takes a lot of paperwork.

08:44.958 --> 08:46.625
And a lot
of loopholes.

08:46.627 --> 08:48.760
O'Connell entered the country
in '85.

08:48.762 --> 08:49.761
Legally?

08:49.763 --> 08:51.897
No, he walked in from Canada.

08:51.899 --> 08:53.598
The British issued a warrant
for terrorism.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.834
So the F.B.I. pops him,
the bring him here.

08:55.836 --> 08:57.836
So why don't you
put him on a plane.

08:57.838 --> 08:59.271
He found the right judge.

08:59.273 --> 09:01.940
Ruled that whatever he had done
was not common crime

09:01.942 --> 09:04.943
but was related to the I.R.A.'S
political goal

09:04.945 --> 09:06.545
of a unified Ireland.

09:06.547 --> 09:08.213
A Federal judge said this?

09:08.215 --> 09:09.314
Oh, it gets worse.

09:09.316 --> 09:11.550
I.N.S. goes to immigration court

09:11.552 --> 09:14.052
immigration judge
orders him deported.

09:14.054 --> 09:16.188
But he's still here.

09:16.189 --> 09:18.323
Because the minute the
deportation order comes down

09:18.325 --> 09:20.325
he applies for political asylum.

09:20.327 --> 09:22.327
So if he did kill Mustafa..?

09:22.329 --> 09:23.662
Off the record?

09:23.664 --> 09:25.864
If we have to bring
him to trial

09:25.866 --> 09:28.300
or if we need him as
a witness against Montez

09:28.302 --> 09:29.568
then he has to stay here.

09:29.570 --> 09:31.754
Nobody wants that.

09:31.755 --> 09:33.939
Maybe nobody with
a federal paycheck wants that,

09:33.941 --> 09:38.643
but me,
I'm just a cop after a killer.

09:38.645 --> 09:40.245
All I'm saying is,
is that obviously

09:40.247 --> 09:42.297
it's not that
cut-and-dried.

09:42.298 --> 09:44.348
You got a Federal judge
who says it's political.

09:44.351 --> 09:46.251
You telling me
that you buy

09:46.253 --> 09:48.253
that Blarney Stone crap
he's been spewing?

09:48.255 --> 09:49.988
You know, it's weird.

09:49.989 --> 09:51.722
Two of our grandparents
come from the same town.

09:51.725 --> 09:54.259
We both got uncles
as priests.

09:54.261 --> 09:55.627
You're both Libras.

09:55.629 --> 09:56.828
That's destiny for you.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.830
What's the matter
with you?

09:58.832 --> 10:00.365
Nothing, I've just
never seen you

10:00.367 --> 10:01.833
get so chummy
with a perp before.

10:01.835 --> 10:02.968
Perp? Come on, Max.

10:02.970 --> 10:04.836
What do you want,
ten to one? 20?

10:04.838 --> 10:07.272
You that sure
Montez did it, huh?

10:07.274 --> 10:08.640
O'Connell never
killed anybody.

10:08.642 --> 10:10.475
No?
No.

10:10.476 --> 10:12.309
Then why is he being
held in a Federal facility

10:12.312 --> 10:13.678
as a terrorist?

10:13.680 --> 10:15.280
Accused terrorist.
It's political.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.282
He's never
even been charged.

10:17.284 --> 10:19.384
What are you
talking about, Mike?

10:19.386 --> 10:22.387
He's been in the can
for five years!

10:22.389 --> 10:25.040
That's right.

10:25.041 --> 10:27.692
Held without charge,
without trial, without bail.

10:27.694 --> 10:29.694
Makes you think, doesn't it?

10:29.696 --> 10:31.329
Think what?
He's a bomb thrower.

10:31.331 --> 10:32.697
He deserves it.

10:32.699 --> 10:36.001
You know how I'd feel
if that were true.

10:36.003 --> 10:38.003
O'Connell's never thrown
a bomb in his life.

10:38.005 --> 10:40.672
The man's a thinker, he's an
organizer, he's a patriot.

10:40.674 --> 10:43.675
For the love of God,
where did you get all this?

10:43.677 --> 10:48.647
From my uncle, the priest

10:48.649 --> 10:52.751
but then he's always been full
of that Blarney Stone crap, too.

10:52.753 --> 10:55.387
I don't give a damn
about the Fed's image problem.

10:55.389 --> 10:57.756
I want one of those two birds
in here

10:57.758 --> 10:59.758
with or without translator,
but with legal counsel.

10:59.760 --> 11:02.661
I want him to fink out
the other guy.

11:02.663 --> 11:04.129
LOGAN:
It's the Cuban.

11:04.131 --> 11:05.363
What is?

11:05.365 --> 11:07.766
He's already
put Montez away.

11:07.768 --> 11:09.000
Irish intuition.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.703
Why don't you
just get his sheet instead?

11:11.705 --> 11:14.706
Hey, ten bucks says
it ties him to Mustafa.

11:14.708 --> 11:17.742
take your intuition
Maybe you could also

11:17.744 --> 11:19.678
over to the deceased's
place of business,

11:19.680 --> 11:21.446
you know, check out the vibe,

11:21.448 --> 11:23.748
if that's not too much trouble.

11:41.468 --> 11:43.802
Mrs. Mustafa?

11:43.804 --> 11:46.004
We're sorry about your husband.

11:46.006 --> 11:48.773
Why? What has happened?

11:48.775 --> 11:50.442
You haven't been notified?

11:50.444 --> 11:52.210
About what?

11:55.716 --> 11:57.482
Ah, geez...

11:57.484 --> 12:00.118
Achmed's dead,
Mrs. Mustafa.

12:04.925 --> 12:06.991
We're sorry.

12:09.196 --> 12:13.031
(<i> Speaking Arabic</i> )

12:13.033 --> 12:14.866
Ma'am...

12:32.786 --> 12:33.985
Pay up.

12:33.987 --> 12:36.054
What's that,
a signed confession?

12:36.056 --> 12:38.189
Montez, Savino Joaquin.

12:38.191 --> 12:40.525
Born in Cuba, blah, blah, blah.

12:40.527 --> 12:41.926
Convictions?

12:41.928 --> 12:45.130
Twice-- murder two,
both by strangulation.

12:45.132 --> 12:47.866
Let me guess--

12:47.868 --> 12:49.834
coroner's report on Mr. Mustafa?

12:49.836 --> 12:51.870
Crushed larynx,
broken windpipe

12:51.872 --> 12:53.772
strangulation.

12:53.774 --> 12:56.875
Montez? Five, no make that
six possessions of heroin.

12:56.877 --> 13:00.211
Twice with intent to sell.
That's in the free world.

13:00.213 --> 13:03.515
God knows what pranks
he pulled in Cuba.

13:03.517 --> 13:05.817
Mustafa was a heroin dealer.

13:05.819 --> 13:08.853
We establish a relationship
in Leavenworth

13:08.855 --> 13:10.889
we got motive.

13:10.891 --> 13:12.824
You straighten
out the Feds yet

13:12.826 --> 13:14.025
about interviewing
other prisoners?

13:14.027 --> 13:15.193
No.

13:15.195 --> 13:17.028
We'd like to clean it up
ASAP, Captain.

13:17.030 --> 13:18.563
You know, the way you wanted it.

13:18.565 --> 13:20.231
We want to move on Montez.

13:20.233 --> 13:22.167
That won't be necessary,
gentlemen.

13:22.169 --> 13:23.868
What?

13:23.870 --> 13:25.904
What's he talking about?

13:25.906 --> 13:29.040
According to him,
there is no homicide case.

13:29.042 --> 13:30.041
Oh?

13:30.043 --> 13:31.576
And why is that?

13:31.578 --> 13:33.077
Mustafa's not dead.

13:33.079 --> 13:35.580
CRAGEN:
Don't laugh.

13:35.582 --> 13:37.048
The "G" has Elvis

13:37.050 --> 13:39.484
at Terminal Island
in California.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.486
Oh, a miracle.

13:41.488 --> 13:44.856
See, once I saw
the coroner wrote

13:44.858 --> 13:48.259
"crushed larynx, D.O.A.,
dead as a doornail"

13:48.261 --> 13:49.928
I was convinced.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.930
Well, nevertheless,
he's still alive

13:51.931 --> 13:53.931
as far as everyone
on his rolodex knows.

13:53.934 --> 13:56.301
Why the hell is that important?

13:56.303 --> 13:58.870
Because I said it is, Sergeant.

13:58.872 --> 14:00.271
National Security.

14:00.273 --> 14:03.274
Mustafa had his greasy fingers
in a lot of pies.

14:03.276 --> 14:05.009
He was helping us.

14:05.011 --> 14:06.945
If certain people
find out he's dead,

14:06.947 --> 14:09.280
we're back to square one.

14:09.282 --> 14:11.015
Don't worry.
You're already there.

14:11.017 --> 14:14.619
We told his wife he was
with Allah yesterday.

14:16.890 --> 14:18.957
Cops.

14:18.959 --> 14:22.894
Unless you got some other
fairy tales you want to tell us

14:22.896 --> 14:24.863
we're going to see Montez

14:24.865 --> 14:27.031
because he's convinced
Mustafa's dead.

14:36.610 --> 14:38.042
I don't believe it.

14:38.044 --> 14:40.979
God almighty, wasn't
anybody watching them?

14:40.981 --> 14:44.015
You can't watch anyone
24 hours a day.

14:48.922 --> 14:50.989
Son of a bitch.

14:59.132 --> 15:01.532
It looks like
Montez checked out

15:01.534 --> 15:03.017
but you never
know anymore.

15:03.018 --> 15:04.501
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

15:04.504 --> 15:06.537
Nothing.

15:06.539 --> 15:08.239
No, really,
what was that crack?

15:08.241 --> 15:09.758
No, it's just
that you Feds

15:09.759 --> 15:11.276
can bring guys back from
the dead-- it's amazing.

15:11.278 --> 15:14.479
So, uh, I guess we'll call
it an accidental hanging.

15:14.481 --> 15:17.615
I guess we'll call it
what the coroner does

15:17.617 --> 15:19.350
when he gets here.

15:19.352 --> 15:21.185
Why don't you stick around

15:21.187 --> 15:23.521
in case this stiff
comes back to life, too.

15:27.560 --> 15:29.928
I still have a homicide
to investigate

15:29.930 --> 15:32.230
and I expect you
to start cooperating.

15:32.232 --> 15:34.265
Like I told you
before, Sergeant,

15:34.267 --> 15:36.601
you're free to
interrogate O'Connell
to your heart's content,

15:36.603 --> 15:39.304
but the other inmates
are still off limits.

15:39.306 --> 15:41.339
Two prisoners
under your jurisdiction

15:41.341 --> 15:43.341
are no longer with us.

15:43.343 --> 15:45.343
One, Mustafa, as you're
so fond of reminding me--

15:45.345 --> 15:48.413
he was murdered
on your turf.

15:48.415 --> 15:50.114
Look.

15:50.116 --> 15:53.151
We've each got a job to do.
It's nothing personal.

15:53.153 --> 15:54.686
I'm telling you,
you're dancing very close

15:54.688 --> 15:56.454
to obstruction of justice.

15:56.456 --> 15:59.724
You don't loosen up,
I got no choice.

15:59.726 --> 16:02.427
I go straight to the D.A.

16:12.272 --> 16:15.173
Look at that groove
on his neck.

16:15.175 --> 16:16.174
CORONER:
Ligature marks.

16:16.176 --> 16:17.742
LOGAN:
From a bed sheet?

16:17.744 --> 16:19.961
Not in my lifetime.

16:19.962 --> 16:22.179
I'd say rope, since there were
fibers embedded in his neck.

16:22.182 --> 16:23.648
So Montez was strangled

16:23.650 --> 16:26.284
then hung up
with a bed sheet.

16:26.286 --> 16:29.487
Wouldn't jump to any conclusions
before the autop.

16:29.489 --> 16:32.423
Did you authorize the guards
to cut the body down?

16:32.425 --> 16:34.525
He was laid out
by the time we got here.

16:34.527 --> 16:36.527
Mucked up a perfectly
nice crime scene.

16:36.529 --> 16:38.596
Don't they teach
these people procedure?

16:38.598 --> 16:42.400
There's always some new guy
who hasn't read the rule book.

16:42.402 --> 16:45.269
We know he didn't do
a Dutch act

16:45.271 --> 16:47.271
so why is he dead?

16:47.273 --> 16:50.008
Payback from Mustafa's posse?

16:50.010 --> 16:53.277
Or somebody wanted
to shut him up.

16:53.279 --> 16:55.246
The Feds fake a suicide?

16:55.248 --> 16:59.317
Shelby look like the type
to host necktie parties to you?

16:59.319 --> 17:01.552
How about your buddy, O'Connell?

17:01.554 --> 17:02.787
What about him?

17:02.789 --> 17:04.689
The guy's a political theorist.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.691
This is nickel-and-dimes,
junkies and pushers.

17:06.693 --> 17:08.559
Come off it, Mike.

17:08.561 --> 17:11.662
You forget why O'Connell
was going to court?

17:11.664 --> 17:14.465
I grew up
with the Westies.

17:14.467 --> 17:16.601
Nice, polite
altar boys.

17:16.603 --> 17:18.603
They make the sign of the cross
when they slit your throat.

17:18.605 --> 17:20.405
Oh, come on.

17:20.407 --> 17:21.706
O'Connell's gonna
have you believing

17:21.708 --> 17:23.574
there are no snakes in Ireland.

17:23.576 --> 17:25.576
There aren't any.

17:25.578 --> 17:27.345
Touche.

17:27.347 --> 17:31.516
Okay, first we check the Arab
angle, then we do the mick.

17:34.320 --> 17:35.720
"Moved to Beirut."

17:35.722 --> 17:39.290
Gee, some people get
all the breaks.

17:39.292 --> 17:41.292
Let's check the garbage.

17:41.294 --> 17:42.727
Yeah.

17:46.066 --> 17:47.732
Oh! Oh!

17:47.734 --> 17:50.768
God! How could anyone
eat something

17:50.770 --> 17:54.272
that could even<i> get</i>
to smell like that?

17:54.274 --> 17:55.807
Bingo.

18:04.717 --> 18:09.353
Looks like a break-dancing
chicken wrote this.

18:09.355 --> 18:10.822
Thank you, professor.

18:10.824 --> 18:13.357
We'll send them
right over.

18:13.359 --> 18:16.394
It didn't used to be
this hard, Mike.

18:16.396 --> 18:18.763
It used to be a lot simpler...

18:18.765 --> 18:20.364
In the old days.

18:20.366 --> 18:21.799
In the old days.

18:24.737 --> 18:26.637
Hey, Max.

18:26.639 --> 18:30.374
They're having a fund-raiser
for O'Connell tonight.

18:30.376 --> 18:31.742
Let's check it out.

18:31.744 --> 18:33.644
Where?

18:33.646 --> 18:35.379
McBride's.

18:35.381 --> 18:37.849
McBride's.

18:37.850 --> 18:40.318
That's the bad the F.B.I.
popped O'Connell in in '85.

18:45.458 --> 18:46.824
Excuse me.

18:46.826 --> 18:48.826
Watch your back...

18:48.828 --> 18:51.596
<i> and</i> watch your hands.

18:51.598 --> 18:53.331
Excuse me.

18:53.333 --> 18:55.700
Oh.

18:55.702 --> 18:58.669
Something stronger
this time?

18:58.671 --> 19:00.404
Just another soda.

19:00.406 --> 19:02.673
Haven't seen
you boys before.

19:02.675 --> 19:04.642
Just came by to see what all

19:04.644 --> 19:05.810
the O'Connell
excitement was about.

19:05.812 --> 19:08.513
I'm Sheila.

19:08.515 --> 19:11.149
Mike Logan. I'm Max Greevey.

19:11.151 --> 19:13.751
Greevey. Would you be
the County Mayo Greeveys

19:13.753 --> 19:15.686
by any chance?

19:15.688 --> 19:17.421
I'm afraid not.

19:17.423 --> 19:19.557
My mother's half Irish, though.

19:19.559 --> 19:23.561
At least you won't be hitting
on me with the Derry can.

19:23.563 --> 19:24.929
A Derry can?

19:24.931 --> 19:27.632
Londonderry relief,
for all the widows and orphans

19:27.634 --> 19:29.700
of Catholics taken away
by the British.

19:29.702 --> 19:31.369
Oh, for
the love of Mike.

19:31.371 --> 19:32.737
MAN:
Hear, hear.

19:32.739 --> 19:34.639
Here's to you, Pat.

19:34.641 --> 19:37.775
MAN #2:
God bless you, boy-o.

19:37.777 --> 19:40.878
You've made us all proud.

19:40.880 --> 19:43.447
Who's the birthday boy?
Looks familiar.

19:43.449 --> 19:49.387
I like cops,
but only when they're off-duty.

19:49.389 --> 19:51.822
Was it that obvious?

19:51.824 --> 19:54.892
Anybody offering you
any undercover assignments?

19:57.730 --> 20:00.464
Uh, look...

20:00.466 --> 20:01.832
I'm sorry.

20:01.834 --> 20:04.569
We didn't mean
to upset you.

20:06.839 --> 20:09.407
My husband was a cop.

20:09.409 --> 20:10.775
In Belfast.

20:10.777 --> 20:12.743
Oh?

20:12.745 --> 20:14.845
Somebody shot him one night

20:14.847 --> 20:17.582
after an I.R.A. man
had been shot

20:17.584 --> 20:20.218
or maybe it was
a British soldier.

20:20.220 --> 20:23.888
It was just one of those nights,
and somebody had to die.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.823
It's all so bloody stupid.

20:25.825 --> 20:28.693
I'm sorry.

20:30.496 --> 20:33.231
Are you going after them?

20:33.233 --> 20:34.865
I don't know. Maybe.

20:34.867 --> 20:36.901
Right now we're
just wondering

20:36.903 --> 20:38.836
about this guy, O'Connell.

20:38.838 --> 20:40.738
You don't know?

20:40.740 --> 20:42.740
The I.R.A. is everywhere.

20:42.742 --> 20:45.643
It's in the prisons,
on the streets.

20:45.645 --> 20:48.012
Maybe even in your own precinct.

20:48.014 --> 20:51.716
The Provos, the Sinn Fein--

20:51.718 --> 20:53.718
they're all the same.

20:53.720 --> 20:55.653
Bloody thugs.

21:00.026 --> 21:01.993
The birthday boy.

21:01.995 --> 21:04.795
McCarter.

21:04.797 --> 21:07.865
He's a prison guard.

21:11.938 --> 21:14.639
Translation of the faxes
from Mustafa's apartment.

21:14.641 --> 21:18.909
A lot of talk about "bricks"
being moved out of Lebanon.

21:18.911 --> 21:21.579
So what? We already know
he was into drug smuggling.

21:21.581 --> 21:23.814
One of the faxes
talks about a shipment of clay

21:23.816 --> 21:25.850
from Libya
to the Netherlands.

21:25.852 --> 21:27.585
Libya is a desert.

21:27.587 --> 21:29.854
You don't find a lot
of clay in the desert.

21:29.856 --> 21:31.689
Plastic explosives?

21:31.691 --> 21:34.892
Last month, the Dutch police
arrested three I.R.A. guys

21:34.894 --> 21:37.295
in a safe house in Amsterdam.

21:37.297 --> 21:39.964
They found 100 pounds
of plastic explosives

21:39.966 --> 21:41.899
in the basement.

21:41.901 --> 21:44.068
I got one for you, too.
The birthday boy?

21:44.070 --> 21:46.837
The one the waitress said
was a prison guard?

21:46.839 --> 21:48.072
McCarter.

21:48.074 --> 21:49.907
Patrick A. McCarter.

21:49.909 --> 21:52.009
He's a Federal prison guard,
and guess what.

21:52.011 --> 21:55.780
The report on Montez says he was
the first one at the scene.

21:55.782 --> 21:57.581
He's the one
that cut Montez down.

21:57.583 --> 21:59.650
That's enough for me.

22:03.823 --> 22:05.589
McCarter.

22:05.591 --> 22:08.492
Patrick McCarter,
you're under arrest

22:08.494 --> 22:10.961
for the murder of Savino Montez.

22:10.963 --> 22:14.899
You have the right
to remain silent and refuse

22:14.901 --> 22:16.801
to answer questions,
do you understand?

22:16.803 --> 22:19.937
Anything you do say
may be used against you

22:19.939 --> 22:22.807
in a court of law,
do you understand?

22:22.809 --> 22:24.742
You have the right
to an attorney.

22:24.744 --> 22:26.010
If you can't afford one,

22:26.012 --> 22:28.579
one will be appointed
to you by the court...

22:30.783 --> 22:33.351
Well, the kid might have ties
to the I.R.A.

22:33.353 --> 22:34.952
but he's a brick wall.

22:34.954 --> 22:36.854
He won't talk
to us.

22:36.856 --> 22:38.956
won't let him talk.
More like Mallahan

22:38.958 --> 22:41.759
ROBINETTE:
Daniel Mallahan?

22:41.761 --> 22:43.994
Boy's got a pretty expensive
mouthpiece.

22:43.996 --> 22:45.830
Big surprise--

22:45.831 --> 22:47.665
friends of Sinn Fein
are footing the bill.

22:47.667 --> 22:49.033
He's bought and paid for.

22:49.035 --> 22:50.801
Friends of Sinn Fein.

22:50.803 --> 22:52.870
That's as subtle
as a Mickey Finn.

22:52.872 --> 22:55.373
We're in court
against the I.R.A.

22:55.375 --> 22:58.943
If by some miracle we do turn
McCarter, are you sure

22:58.945 --> 23:02.012
that he can implicate O'Connell
in Mustafa's murder?

23:02.014 --> 23:03.981
Montez was the only witness.

23:03.983 --> 23:05.950
O'Connell had
a compelling motive

23:05.952 --> 23:07.885
to have him shut up.

23:07.887 --> 23:11.088
All right, we'll twist McCarter.

23:12.625 --> 23:15.126
Thanks, Max.

23:15.128 --> 23:17.828
We may have bitten off
more than we can chew.

23:17.830 --> 23:19.764
Mallahan knows the case is thin.

23:19.766 --> 23:21.432
Look on the bright side.

23:21.434 --> 23:22.833
What bright side?

23:22.835 --> 23:25.669
We're not in Boston.

23:25.671 --> 23:28.839
McCarter was fired from
the department of sanitation

23:28.841 --> 23:30.841
for petty larceny--
no charges filed.

23:30.843 --> 23:31.976
Makes for
an ideal candidate

23:31.978 --> 23:34.845
for a job in a Federal
detention center.

23:34.847 --> 23:36.847
He had help
getting hired.

23:36.849 --> 23:38.048
Letter of recommendation
from Liam Kildare.

23:38.050 --> 23:39.917
Commissioner Shannon's
assistant?

23:39.919 --> 23:42.052
Our Mr. McCarter's
plugged in.

23:46.726 --> 23:49.126
Mr. McCarter,
who got you your job

23:49.128 --> 23:51.128
in the bureau
of prisons?

23:51.130 --> 23:53.998
That information
is not within your purview.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.033
Was it your I.R.A. friends?
Who recruited you?

23:56.035 --> 23:59.870
My friend's allegiances
are not at issue.

23:59.872 --> 24:02.206
His membership in
a terrorist organization is.

24:02.208 --> 24:04.642
I'm no terrorist.
I'm a soldier.

24:04.644 --> 24:08.479
What he means is, he is
a man of conscience.

24:08.481 --> 24:12.016
What he means is he is the
misguided romantic dupe

24:12.018 --> 24:14.685
of those who consider
him completely expendable.

24:14.687 --> 24:16.887
This interview is over.

24:16.889 --> 24:17.822
Sit down, sir.

24:17.824 --> 24:18.989
I'm not finished.

24:18.991 --> 24:22.893
You were just a
common thief, Patrick.

24:22.895 --> 24:25.179
Now you're looking at murder.

24:25.180 --> 24:27.464
Counselor, if you have
any relevant questions...

24:27.467 --> 24:30.067
You're way beyond the protection
of those who got you into this.

24:30.069 --> 24:32.503
You talk to us, we'll offer
you a plea bargain.

24:32.505 --> 24:36.774
My client is not looking
for a deal.

24:36.776 --> 24:38.843
You don't have a lot of room
to dance, Patrick,

24:38.845 --> 24:40.778
no matter what
your lawyer told you.

24:40.780 --> 24:42.964
You're 22 years old.

24:42.965 --> 24:45.149
Do you really want to spend
the rest of your life in prison?

24:45.151 --> 24:47.218
He is not interested.

24:47.220 --> 24:51.255
Mr. Mallahan,
I'd like a word with you.

25:02.735 --> 25:04.535
If you want
this kid crucified,

25:04.537 --> 25:06.804
you're making
all the right moves.

25:06.806 --> 25:08.138
Are you questioning
my professional judgment?

25:08.140 --> 25:10.174
That depends on who
your client is.

25:10.176 --> 25:12.910
Patrick, McCarter,
regardless of who pays my fee.

25:12.912 --> 25:15.145
That better be true,
or I'll drag you before

25:15.147 --> 25:17.047
the disciplinary committee
of the bar association.

25:17.049 --> 25:19.066
And tell them what?

25:19.067 --> 25:21.084
That I'm making you work
for your paycheck?

25:21.087 --> 25:22.920
Now, listen to me, Counselor.

25:22.922 --> 25:25.956
You're not going
to run-and-gun some cheap plea

25:25.958 --> 25:27.291
down my client's throat.

25:27.293 --> 25:29.226
Your client is
facing a murder rap.

25:29.228 --> 25:33.030
The rope we found in his
car matches the marks
on Montez's neck.

25:33.032 --> 25:36.534
And the same kind of rope you
find in the prison machine shop.

25:36.536 --> 25:38.068
It's all circumstantial.

25:38.070 --> 25:40.204
It's not circumstantial when
you have a fiber match

25:40.206 --> 25:43.774
and a hair from Montez on the
rope in McCarter's car.

25:43.776 --> 25:48.078
Well, I guess we'll have to wait
and see what a jury says.

25:48.080 --> 25:51.849
You and I both know
that he was the only guard

25:51.851 --> 25:54.118
on the floor for 45 minutes.

25:54.120 --> 25:56.253
That's enough to bury him,
and bury him I will,

25:56.255 --> 26:00.257
along with you
and your Sinn Fein money.

26:00.259 --> 26:03.127
When I present your conduct in
this case before the bar

26:03.129 --> 26:05.095
and your clear-cut
conflict of interest,

26:05.097 --> 26:07.197
you'll be lucky
to have a license.

26:11.103 --> 26:12.970
You, uh...

26:12.972 --> 26:17.241
you want to present
some options to my client?

26:17.243 --> 26:20.911
Go ahead.

26:20.913 --> 26:23.314
You won't get
any argument from me.

26:27.253 --> 26:30.921
McCarter says he killed Montez
on orders from O'Connell.

26:30.923 --> 26:32.456
Orders?

26:32.457 --> 26:33.990
Yeah, O'Connell is
his I.R.A. superior

26:33.993 --> 26:35.993
on the chain of command.

26:35.995 --> 26:38.128
And McCarter thinks of himself
as a soldier...

26:38.130 --> 26:40.130
a loyal member
of a long-standing army

26:40.132 --> 26:43.133
that has been under arms in one
form or another since

26:43.135 --> 26:46.136
the Battle of the Boyne, and
that was about 300 years ago.

26:46.138 --> 26:47.905
You researched this?

26:47.907 --> 26:50.174
No, it was spoon-fed to me.

26:50.176 --> 26:52.009
My grandmother was Irish.

26:52.011 --> 26:53.177
Fahey.

26:53.179 --> 26:55.879
She thought it was a holy war.

26:55.881 --> 26:58.382
Michael Collins, Robert Emmett.

26:58.384 --> 27:01.986
She'd recite those names
like they were saints in heaven.

27:01.988 --> 27:04.188
I suppose in their time
they were,

27:04.190 --> 27:07.658
but the likes of McCarter
and O'Connell are thugs--

27:07.660 --> 27:09.193
they're Nazis with brogues.

27:09.195 --> 27:11.395
You're worried that by putting
O'Connell on trial

27:11.397 --> 27:13.397
might give him legitimacy,
turn him into a martyr.

27:13.399 --> 27:16.634
To a fanatic, a trial's just an
opportunity to win converts.

27:16.636 --> 27:18.235
How solid is this case?

27:18.237 --> 27:21.238
McCarter says that he'll testify

27:21.240 --> 27:26.043
that O'Connell admitted
strangling Mustafa,

27:26.045 --> 27:27.645
but that's my problem

27:27.646 --> 27:29.246
because it all depends
on the kid's testimony

27:29.248 --> 27:31.215
and I'm afraid
he'd go in the tank on me.

27:31.217 --> 27:33.317
O'Connell threatened
to have him tooled if he talked.

27:33.319 --> 27:36.654
Have him what?
It's the newest weapon
in the I.R.A. arsenal.

27:36.656 --> 27:39.390
They kneecap a man with a power
drill, he never walks again.

27:39.392 --> 27:41.325
We can protect him.

27:41.327 --> 27:45.329
He ever give you any indication
of why O'Connell killed Mustafa?

27:45.331 --> 27:49.333
No, and that's another place
we're vulnerable-- motive.

27:49.335 --> 27:51.335
O'Connell and Mustafa

27:51.337 --> 27:53.370
they moved
in a very shadowy world.

27:53.372 --> 27:56.140
The faxes that Greevey and Logan
found at Mustafa's,

27:56.142 --> 27:58.876
they make a connection,
but it's nothing I could prove.

27:58.878 --> 28:02.312
Might know someone who can.

28:06.252 --> 28:09.286
Jennie, get me
the British consulate.

28:09.288 --> 28:11.455
Adams said you needed
some information

28:11.457 --> 28:14.024
on this Mustafa fellow?

28:14.026 --> 28:16.193
We're looking for links
to O'Connell.

28:16.195 --> 28:19.196
As you know, your F.B.I. has
worked up a whole dossier

28:19.198 --> 28:21.198
on I.R.A. dealings
with the Lebanese.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.333
More to the point,
with Achmed Mustafa.

28:23.335 --> 28:26.136
No, sir, we
didn't know.
Oh?

28:26.138 --> 28:27.404
The counter-terrorist division's

28:27.406 --> 28:29.440
had him under surveillance
for some time.

28:29.442 --> 28:33.343
Mustafa was a conduit
for weapons to the I.R.A.

28:33.345 --> 28:35.145
What kind
of weapons?

28:35.147 --> 28:36.947
You name it.
He's even suspected of

28:36.949 --> 28:39.116
supplying them with
surface-to-air missiles

28:39.118 --> 28:40.484
of the same type
that shot down

28:40.486 --> 28:42.352
one of our helicopters
a short while ago.

28:42.354 --> 28:44.288
The Syrians are involved,
along the way.

28:44.290 --> 28:47.024
But your F.B.I.
will have all that.

28:47.026 --> 28:48.992
Paul, find out who the head of

28:48.994 --> 28:50.227
the anti-terrorist division
in New York is.

28:50.229 --> 28:53.297
Oh, that's a chap
named Axelrod.

28:53.299 --> 28:56.967
Syrians, I.R.A.,
Lebanese...

28:58.304 --> 29:01.271
Red Army, Baader-Meinhof,
Libyans...

29:01.273 --> 29:03.974
you poke a lamp
under the sheets

29:03.976 --> 29:05.309
and you'll find
strange bedfellows

29:05.311 --> 29:08.445
doing some
very nasty things together.

29:10.483 --> 29:13.350
Talk about a guy
with his own agenda.

29:15.387 --> 29:19.289
Because Washington wants
O'Connell off page one.

29:19.291 --> 29:22.126
He's become a political tumor.

29:22.128 --> 29:24.328
The man's a suspect
in a homicide.

29:24.330 --> 29:26.430
He did a Lebanese drug dealer.

29:26.432 --> 29:29.032
An inch and a half
on page eight.

29:29.034 --> 29:31.001
What, not enough sound bite
appeal?

29:31.003 --> 29:35.205
Mr. Robinette, there are
43 million Irish-Americans

29:35.207 --> 29:37.257
in this country,

29:37.258 --> 29:39.308
some of whom
wield enormous political weight.

29:39.311 --> 29:41.178
So we ignore murder to save
ourselves

29:41.180 --> 29:44.481
the international embarrassment
of holding a terrorist

29:44.483 --> 29:46.316
without charges?

29:46.318 --> 29:48.552
Look, come next week,

29:48.554 --> 29:50.521
he's probably going to be
granted political asylum.

29:50.523 --> 29:52.790
And then he's going
to be old news.

29:52.792 --> 29:56.160
You put him on trial,
and you give him a pulpit.

29:56.162 --> 30:01.365
It's a whole new concept--
crime without punishment.

30:01.367 --> 30:04.802
What's the matter
with you guys in
the D.A.'s office?

30:04.804 --> 30:07.371
Got no peripheral vision?
Can't you see the big picture?

30:07.373 --> 30:10.174
We're just not blinded by it.

30:15.047 --> 30:17.147
(<i> clamoring voices</i> )

30:17.149 --> 30:19.449
Five years
of unjust imprisonment

30:19.451 --> 30:21.585
wiped clean
in under ten minutes.

30:21.587 --> 30:24.221
Is that an indication that
a civil suit may be pending?

30:24.223 --> 30:26.223
No, there will be no more
legal beagling.

30:26.225 --> 30:28.091
I've been given asylum
in a country

30:28.093 --> 30:29.426
that truly is
the cradle of liberty.

30:29.428 --> 30:31.962
I just want to get on
with my life.

30:31.963 --> 30:34.497
The British have petitioned
for your extradition back to
England to face charges.

30:34.500 --> 30:37.100
Anything you'd like to say to
the House of Commons?

30:37.102 --> 30:39.603
Kiss me rosie Irish bum,
gentlemen.

30:39.605 --> 30:43.373
No bitterness toward
Capitol Hill for being
held for five years

30:43.375 --> 30:44.858
without any charges
being brought?

30:44.859 --> 30:46.342
If there's bitterness,
I can't find it.

30:46.345 --> 30:48.312
All I can feel is
a sense of gratitude.

30:48.314 --> 30:50.848
The American justice
system may be slow,

30:50.850 --> 30:52.449
but at least
it's accurate.

30:52.451 --> 30:55.252
This should move it from page
eight to page one.

30:55.254 --> 30:58.155
I'm looking forward to staying
here in New York for awhile

30:58.157 --> 31:00.390
and working
with this fine...
Counselor,
a word with your client?

31:00.392 --> 31:01.558
What about?
Just talk over here.

31:01.560 --> 31:03.393
REPORTER:
Excuse me, sir, who are you?

31:03.395 --> 31:05.495
You're under arrest for
the murder of Achmed Mustafa.

31:05.497 --> 31:08.265
You have the right
to remain silent
and refuse

31:08.267 --> 31:09.633
to answer questions.
Do you understand?

31:09.635 --> 31:11.535
Anything you do say may
be used against you...

REILLY:
<i> And so, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

31:17.977 --> 31:19.643
what is on trial here

31:19.645 --> 31:24.014
is the Constitution
of the United States of America.

31:24.016 --> 31:26.383
Mr. O'Connell has been held

31:26.385 --> 31:28.952
in the penal system
of the United States

31:28.954 --> 31:32.022
for five long years,

31:32.024 --> 31:33.590
without ever once
having a charge

31:33.592 --> 31:35.993
brought against him
until now--

31:35.995 --> 31:40.330
until the very<i> day</i>
of his first taste of freedom.

31:40.332 --> 31:44.001
And why?

31:44.003 --> 31:49.573
Because the British government
is afraid...

31:49.575 --> 31:54.144
<i> afraid</i> to have the truth
come out,

31:54.146 --> 31:57.014
because, ladies and gentlemen,

31:57.016 --> 32:00.684
the life
of a Lebanese heroin pusher

32:00.686 --> 32:03.053
is apparently more important

32:03.055 --> 32:08.125
than the freedom
of an Irish patriot.

32:08.127 --> 32:10.994
(<i> gavel banging</i> )
JUDGE:
I will not tolerate this.

32:10.996 --> 32:13.931
One more outburst,
and I'll clear this court.

32:13.933 --> 32:17.034
Are you at the end
of your blather, Mr. Reilly?

32:17.036 --> 32:19.670
Yes, yes, Your Honor. I am.

32:19.672 --> 32:20.971
Good.

32:20.973 --> 32:22.673
Mr. Stone?

32:22.675 --> 32:26.410
The people call
Patrick McCarter, Your Honor.

32:37.056 --> 32:38.756
Raise your right hand,
please.

32:38.757 --> 32:40.457
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,

32:40.459 --> 32:42.159
so help you God?
I do.

32:42.161 --> 32:43.727
Please be seated.

32:43.729 --> 32:46.063
Please tell the court
your name.

32:46.065 --> 32:48.065
Patrick Aloysius McCarter.

32:48.067 --> 32:50.067
And you are a resident of...

32:50.069 --> 32:51.468
New York City.

32:51.470 --> 32:53.170
And your occupation?

32:53.172 --> 32:54.972
I'm a prison guard.

32:54.974 --> 32:58.675
At the Federal Detention
Center in lower Manhattan,
is that correct?

32:58.677 --> 33:00.043
Yes.

33:00.045 --> 33:02.112
Mr. McCarter, did you kill
a federal prisoner

33:02.114 --> 33:05.082
named Savino Montez?

33:05.084 --> 33:07.617
Yes.

33:07.619 --> 33:09.386
Why?

33:09.388 --> 33:12.656
I was ordered to.

33:12.658 --> 33:14.691
By whom?

33:21.600 --> 33:25.102
Answer the question,
Mr. McCarter.

33:25.104 --> 33:26.770
The organization.

33:26.772 --> 33:30.040
They told me to
shut the Cuban's gob

33:30.042 --> 33:32.776
before he talked about O'Connell
killing the Arab.

33:32.778 --> 33:34.444
Which organization?

33:34.446 --> 33:37.714
The provisional wing
of the Irish Republican Army.

33:37.716 --> 33:41.251
Now, did Mr. O'Connell
have knowledge of these orders?

33:41.253 --> 33:42.686
Objection, Your Honor.

33:42.688 --> 33:44.855
Hearsay.

33:44.856 --> 33:47.023
Your Honor, I believe the
witness had direct contact

33:47.026 --> 33:48.425
with the accused.

33:48.427 --> 33:50.427
Objection overruled.

33:50.429 --> 33:53.430
Answer the question,
Mr. McCarter.

33:53.432 --> 33:56.233
Yes, yes, he did.

33:56.235 --> 34:00.270
He told me I was performing
an act of patriotism.

34:02.141 --> 34:06.143
And did Mr. O'Connell
personally tell you

34:06.145 --> 34:09.679
that he had killed
Achmed Mustafa?

34:09.681 --> 34:12.449
Yes, sir, he most certainly did.

34:12.451 --> 34:16.520
He said that he had executed
an enemy of the Irish people.

34:16.522 --> 34:19.156
No further questions,
Your Honor.

34:19.158 --> 34:25.162
I have very few questions
to ask of this quisling.

34:25.164 --> 34:27.097
Objection, Your Honor.
Characterization.

34:27.099 --> 34:28.832
Sustained.

34:28.834 --> 34:31.802
Mr. McCarter,
you admit to the murder

34:31.804 --> 34:34.805
of one Savino Montez
in cold blood.

34:34.807 --> 34:36.239
Is that correct?

34:36.241 --> 34:38.191
Yes.

34:38.192 --> 34:40.142
You've been allowed
to enter a plea of guilty

34:40.145 --> 34:42.279
to second-degree
manslaughter

34:42.281 --> 34:43.847
for that heinous crime

34:43.849 --> 34:47.184
in exchange for
your uncorroborated testimony

34:47.186 --> 34:49.820
against the defendant.
Is that not true, yes or no?

34:49.822 --> 34:51.188
Yes, sir.

34:51.190 --> 34:53.256
I have no further questions.

34:55.094 --> 34:58.161
Mr. Axelrod's testimony
goes to the very heart

34:58.163 --> 35:01.164
of O'Connell's motive
for killing Mustafa.

35:01.166 --> 35:02.699
Mr. Stone doesn't get it.

35:02.701 --> 35:04.868
You put me on the stand,
O'Connell's lawyers

35:04.870 --> 35:07.170
will cross-examine my whole
operation into the ground.

35:07.172 --> 35:09.172
The people's interest
can be served

35:09.174 --> 35:11.208
without jeopardizing legitimate
areas of national security.

35:11.210 --> 35:13.176
That's cold comfort, Mr. Stone.

35:13.178 --> 35:15.745
I've got breathing assets
to protect.

35:15.747 --> 35:17.280
And I've got a murder
to prosecute.

35:17.282 --> 35:19.216
The murder of
an A-rab dope peddler,

35:19.218 --> 35:21.751
for God's sake!
An A-rab dope
peddler?!

35:21.753 --> 35:23.787
You went to a lot of trouble
to protect Mustafa.

35:23.789 --> 35:25.222
Now you're gonna let his
executioner walk,

35:25.224 --> 35:26.790
all because
of political expediency?

35:26.792 --> 35:29.359
I don't know how that sits with
you, but me, that's immoral.

35:29.361 --> 35:31.628
Oh, spare me that sanctimonious
bull, Counselor!

35:31.630 --> 35:33.330
I live in the real world.

35:33.332 --> 35:34.631
So do I, sir.

35:34.633 --> 35:36.900
I know my way around politics.

35:36.902 --> 35:39.169
Mr. Axelrod, lay out for me

35:39.171 --> 35:42.172
how this connection between the
I.R.A. and Mustafa worked.

35:44.209 --> 35:47.177
The Lebanese grow opium
in the Bakaa Valley.

35:47.179 --> 35:51.181
They sell it to the Syrians,
who refine it into heroin

35:51.183 --> 35:53.617
and sell it on the open market.

35:53.619 --> 35:56.219
The Syrians use those profits
to fund a variety

35:56.221 --> 35:59.156
of terrorist groups,
that's including the I.R.A.

36:00.926 --> 36:04.327
As long as Mr. Stone
confines his questions

36:04.329 --> 36:07.330
to the specifics
of the I.R.A. connection,

36:07.332 --> 36:10.167
I can't see
how national security

36:10.169 --> 36:11.868
is compromised.

36:11.870 --> 36:13.803
In other words, Mr. Axelrod,

36:13.805 --> 36:17.240
the I.R.A. buys weapons
with Syrian drug money?

36:17.242 --> 36:18.942
That's right.

36:18.944 --> 36:23.914
And how does Mr. Achmed Mustafa
fit into the scheme of things?

36:23.916 --> 36:25.916
He was a cutout.

36:25.918 --> 36:27.584
A cutout?

36:27.586 --> 36:28.785
A middleman.

36:28.787 --> 36:31.788
The Syrians used him
to sell drugs.

36:31.790 --> 36:34.191
The I.R.A. used him
to buy weapons.

36:34.193 --> 36:36.860
Two months ago,
Mustafa screwed the I.R.A.

36:36.862 --> 36:39.079
on a major deal--

36:39.080 --> 36:41.297
he shortchanged them
to the tune of about $800,000.

36:41.300 --> 36:42.732
And?

36:42.734 --> 36:45.969
The I.R.A. high
command put out
a hit on Mustafa.

36:45.971 --> 36:49.306
Looks like
somebody carried out the orders.

36:49.308 --> 36:50.740
Objection, Your Honor.

36:50.742 --> 36:51.875
Supposition.

36:51.877 --> 36:53.276
Sustained.

36:53.278 --> 36:56.279
No further questions,
Your Honor.

36:59.384 --> 37:02.786
Fascinating,
Agent Axelrod,

37:02.788 --> 37:04.688
absolutely fascinating.

37:04.690 --> 37:07.357
Now would you mind
telling this court

37:07.359 --> 37:09.726
exactly what that has to do
with Mr. O'Connell

37:09.728 --> 37:12.729
who, as we all know,
was held without trial,

37:12.731 --> 37:15.632
without ever once being charged
with a crime

37:15.634 --> 37:17.801
for<i> five</i> long years?

37:17.803 --> 37:19.336
The defendant
is a member

37:19.338 --> 37:21.404
of the Irish
Republican Army.

37:21.406 --> 37:24.641
And the last time I looked,
that was not a crime

37:24.643 --> 37:27.244
under federal
or New York State law.

37:27.246 --> 37:29.679
Can you cite
any criminal statute

37:29.681 --> 37:33.683
that Mr. O'Connell has violated
by his membership in the I.R.A.?

37:33.685 --> 37:36.353
Objection, Your Honor.
Draws a conclusion of law.

37:36.355 --> 37:37.887
Sustained.

37:37.889 --> 37:40.290
No further questions,
Your Honor.

37:42.327 --> 37:45.695
My membership in the Sinn Fein
is a matter of public record.

37:45.697 --> 37:48.365
It is the legal, political wing
of the I.R.A.

37:48.367 --> 37:51.034
The non-violent wing,
is that right?

37:51.036 --> 37:52.669
That's right.

37:52.671 --> 37:54.671
We're not a bunch
of killers,

37:54.673 --> 37:56.406
despite what
the British press says.

37:56.408 --> 37:59.409
Have you had
any personal dealings

37:59.411 --> 38:01.711
with the late Mr. Mustafa?

38:01.713 --> 38:03.046
No, I have not.

38:03.048 --> 38:05.315
Any business?

38:05.317 --> 38:09.386
None, and for the record,
I might say

38:09.388 --> 38:11.888
I abhor the drug dealing
that the man was engaged in--

38:11.890 --> 38:14.924
I consider it anti-Christian
and anti-life.

38:14.926 --> 38:18.061
Yet we've heard testimony
here linking the I.R.A.

38:18.063 --> 38:20.697
to Syrian drug money
and Mr. Mustafa.

38:20.699 --> 38:21.931
I don't know
anything about it.

38:21.933 --> 38:23.833
I have nothing to do
with the Provos.

38:23.835 --> 38:26.936
Ah, the Provos.
That would be

38:26.938 --> 38:29.873
the provisional
or military wing of the I.R.A.?

38:29.875 --> 38:32.942
Yes. They conduct their business
in their own way.

38:32.944 --> 38:35.545
I don't condone it,
but I understand it.

38:35.547 --> 38:37.947
As I've said,
we're in a war.

38:37.949 --> 38:41.051
Sometimes, one has to make pacts
with the devil.

38:41.053 --> 38:42.986
And in this war

38:42.988 --> 38:46.990
you yourself have
never personally engaged

38:46.992 --> 38:48.992
in any violent act.

38:48.994 --> 38:50.994
Is that correct?

38:50.996 --> 38:52.095
That's so.

38:52.097 --> 38:54.064
I've never even
thrown a punch.

38:54.066 --> 38:56.433
Thank you very much,
Mr. O'Connell.

38:56.435 --> 38:59.369
No further questions,
Your Honor.

39:01.473 --> 39:04.074
I must say, to a civilian,
it looks rather like

39:04.076 --> 39:07.110
you're getting your ears boxed
by Mr. Reilly.

39:07.112 --> 39:09.112
I didn't see you
in court.

39:09.114 --> 39:12.115
One learns to be invisible
when one wishes,

39:12.117 --> 39:13.383
<i>and</i> deprecating.

39:13.385 --> 39:15.085
About what?

39:15.087 --> 39:16.853
The value of one's own advice.

39:16.855 --> 39:19.122
Go ahead,
Mr. Fenwick.
Well, correct me if I'm wrong,

39:19.124 --> 39:21.458
but under your rules
of cross-examination

39:21.460 --> 39:23.393
aren't you allowed
to pounce

39:23.395 --> 39:26.363
on something offered as fact
under direct examination?

39:26.365 --> 39:27.397
Such as?

39:27.399 --> 39:29.065
Such as a witness's assertion

39:29.067 --> 39:33.370
that he's never committed
a violent act.
Why? What have you got?

39:33.372 --> 39:36.005
Mr. O'Connell belongs in
jail-- your jail, our jail,
it doesn't matter which.

39:36.007 --> 39:38.141
As long as he's behind bars.
He must also be exposed

39:38.143 --> 39:40.810
for what he really is--
a bloodthirsty terrorist.

39:40.812 --> 39:42.379
I don't need a
speech, Mr. Fenwick.

39:42.381 --> 39:44.381
Have you got something
I can use?

39:44.383 --> 39:46.049
We have a way for you

39:46.051 --> 39:48.151
to discredit
O'Connell's contention

39:48.153 --> 39:50.153
that he's nonviolent.

39:50.155 --> 39:52.155
A way? What is that
supposed to mean?

39:52.157 --> 39:54.991
We could supply
a sworn affidavit.

39:54.993 --> 39:57.494
You bastard. You have
a witness, don't you?

39:57.496 --> 39:59.396
As I said, we could
supply an affidavit.

39:59.398 --> 40:01.398
I'm fed up with this spook crap.
If you have a witness

40:01.400 --> 40:03.633
you put him on the Concorde
and you get him in court

40:03.635 --> 40:05.869
here tomorrow, or as God is my
witness, I'll subpoena<i> you.</i>

40:07.572 --> 40:09.973
She'll be here in the morning.

40:11.910 --> 40:14.043
You consider yourself
a Christian, Mr. O'Connell?

40:14.045 --> 40:16.045
Most certainly.

40:16.046 --> 40:18.046
Yet the credo
of the Irish Republican Army

40:18.049 --> 40:21.184
seems more along the lines
of "an eye for an eye"

40:21.186 --> 40:23.653
as versus
"turn the other cheek."

40:23.655 --> 40:25.188
Wouldn't you agree?

40:25.190 --> 40:27.490
Is the I.R.A. on trial here?

40:27.492 --> 40:29.659
That depends on you, sir.

40:29.661 --> 40:33.062
I have declared my membership
in the Sinn Fein.

40:33.064 --> 40:35.064
Yes, you have.

40:35.066 --> 40:38.201
And what does the political wing
of the army think

40:38.203 --> 40:42.205
when the other wing blows up
a busload of school children?

40:42.207 --> 40:43.540
Objection.

40:43.542 --> 40:45.909
We're going far afield here.

40:45.911 --> 40:48.211
This has relevance
as to character, Your Honor.

40:48.213 --> 40:50.180
Answer the question.

40:50.182 --> 40:53.183
The organization
has always given ample warning

40:53.185 --> 40:55.485
before a device is activated,

40:55.487 --> 40:57.554
but there's always the risk

40:57.556 --> 40:59.622
of human error.

41:02.227 --> 41:05.462
Human error.

41:05.464 --> 41:08.164
You have testified
under oath

41:08.166 --> 41:10.467
that you have never committed
a violent act.

41:10.469 --> 41:11.568
Never in my life.

41:11.570 --> 41:12.569
Never?

41:12.571 --> 41:13.937
Never.

41:15.874 --> 41:18.074
No more questions,
Your Honor.

41:18.076 --> 41:20.577
You may step down,
Mr. O'Connell.

41:20.579 --> 41:22.579
May I ask you a question, sir?

41:22.581 --> 41:26.616
How, with the map of Donegal
on your mug, did you ever end up

41:26.618 --> 41:28.618
with a name
like Stone?

41:28.620 --> 41:30.487
Happenstance, sir.

41:30.489 --> 41:32.222
Same way you ended up

41:32.224 --> 41:35.058
with the name of a real
Irish patriot.

41:35.060 --> 41:37.227
You have any other questions,
Mr. O'Connell?

41:38.897 --> 41:41.197
You may step down,
Mr. O'Connell.

41:43.001 --> 41:46.102
Your Honor,
the accused has stated

41:46.104 --> 41:47.504
in both direct and
cross-examination

41:47.506 --> 41:50.006
that he has never committed
a violent act...

41:50.008 --> 41:52.509
that he is a man
of conscience...

41:52.511 --> 41:54.577
a prisoner
because of politics.

41:54.579 --> 41:56.513
In view of these statements

41:56.515 --> 42:00.016
the state would like to call
an additional witness.

42:00.018 --> 42:01.785
Objection.

42:01.786 --> 42:03.553
The prosecution has rested,
Your Honor.

42:03.555 --> 42:05.255
Of his own volition,

42:05.257 --> 42:07.524
Mr. O'Connell
has made statements

42:07.526 --> 42:09.526
that call for rebuttal, sir.

42:09.528 --> 42:10.527
Overruled.

42:10.529 --> 42:13.530
Call your witness, Mr. Stone.

42:13.532 --> 42:14.664
Thank you, Your Honor.

42:14.666 --> 42:17.233
The people call
Bridget McDiarmid.

42:35.053 --> 42:37.253
Mrs. McDiarmid,
are you married?

42:37.255 --> 42:39.255
I was.

42:39.257 --> 42:41.257
Do you have children?

42:41.259 --> 42:42.659
I had two.

42:42.661 --> 42:44.661
What happened
to your husband

42:44.663 --> 42:46.296
and your children?

42:48.233 --> 42:50.600
That man murdered them.

42:52.237 --> 42:53.670
REILLY:
Objection,
Your Honor.

42:53.672 --> 42:55.605
Absolutely irrelevant.

42:55.607 --> 42:58.041
Rebutting
the defendant's sworn testimony

42:58.043 --> 42:59.676
is relevant as to character,
Your Honor.

42:59.678 --> 43:02.078
Overruled.
Proceed, Mr. Stone.

43:02.080 --> 43:06.015
Mrs. McDiarmid,
describe in your own words

43:06.017 --> 43:08.585
the events
of May 6, 1981.

43:08.587 --> 43:11.020
John...

43:12.791 --> 43:18.127
my husband and I
were on High Street, Kensington

43:18.129 --> 43:22.098
on our way to the cinema
with Sheila and Tommy.

43:22.100 --> 43:24.100
Your children?

43:24.102 --> 43:25.668
Yes.

43:25.670 --> 43:28.671
We were passing a candy store.

43:28.673 --> 43:33.710
I remember because
the children wanted to stop.

43:33.712 --> 43:37.680
My husband saw a man
tying his shoe

43:37.682 --> 43:42.118
kneeling on the pavement.

43:42.120 --> 43:44.187
That man...

43:46.124 --> 43:50.126
When he was done,
he got up and hurried away

43:50.128 --> 43:53.730
but he'd left his satchel
on the curb

43:53.732 --> 43:55.732
next to the police van.

43:55.734 --> 43:58.868
Would you describe
the satchel?

43:58.870 --> 44:00.637
Come on, Your Honor...

44:00.639 --> 44:03.840
Please continue, Mrs. McDiarmid.

44:05.777 --> 44:09.145
It was, uh,
it was black.

44:09.147 --> 44:10.413
Leather.

44:10.415 --> 44:14.150
With a grip

44:14.152 --> 44:16.119
like any businessman's
in the city.

44:16.121 --> 44:17.387
Thank you.

44:17.389 --> 44:20.223
Now tell us
what happened next.

44:24.162 --> 44:27.163
My husband called to the man.

44:27.165 --> 44:29.065
You know...

44:29.067 --> 44:32.902
"Oy, mate,
you forgot your satchel."

44:32.904 --> 44:36.739
And... then he...

44:36.741 --> 44:42.712
he picked up the case
and started after him and...

44:42.714 --> 44:44.681
And...?

44:44.683 --> 44:47.316
And he was blown to bits,
and Sheila,

44:47.318 --> 44:50.119
and Tommy,
and half the street...

44:50.121 --> 44:54.090
There was nothing but a shower
of glass and blood.

44:54.092 --> 44:57.093
Mrs. McDiarmid,
the man with the satchel--

44:57.095 --> 44:59.395
are you absolutely positive,

44:59.397 --> 45:02.165
without a question
of a doubt

45:02.167 --> 45:06.235
that that man was Ian
O'Connell, the defendant?

45:13.111 --> 45:16.112
You hardly forget
the face of the man

45:16.114 --> 45:18.781
who slaughtered
your entire family.

45:18.783 --> 45:21.150
(<i> jurors murmuring</i> )

45:35.266 --> 45:37.400
Take a good look.

45:37.402 --> 45:39.769
There is your human error.

45:47.145 --> 45:51.147
And Mr. O'Connell's sentence
of 25 years to life

45:51.149 --> 45:54.150
is a fitting conclusion
to this case.

45:54.152 --> 45:58.154
This prosecution shows the value
and necessity

45:58.156 --> 46:03.159
of inter-agency cooperation
on a local, state, federal

46:03.161 --> 46:06.162
<i> and</i> international level.

46:06.164 --> 46:08.364
These men arrayed behind me

46:08.366 --> 46:13.369
showed powerful, personal,
professional bonds

46:13.371 --> 46:18.975
to bring an international
terrorist to justice.

46:18.977 --> 46:22.211
Thank you very much.
