Hey, Butch, Sundance,

you guys better be careful

- Okay, Jesse.

00:18.393 --> 00:20.437
Jesse, what Jesse?

00:18.393 --> 00:20.437
Wait, what happened to daddy?

Oh, Jess, don't take

00:22.481 --> 00:24.650
it personally.

00:24.692 --> 00:26.443
It's just a phase kids go

00:24.692 --> 00:26.443
through when they realize

00:26.485 --> 00:27.862
their parents have names.

00:27.903 --> 00:29.530
It's kinda cute, right, boys?

00:29.571 --> 00:31.490
Right, Becky.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.575
Hey, that's mommy.

00:33.617 --> 00:36.161
- Mom for short.

00:33.617 --> 00:36.161
- I thought it was cute.

00:36.203 --> 00:37.788
It was cute when

- It's okay.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.278

03:57.320 --> 04:00.699
stride to the curb

08:03.358 --> 08:05.526
Daddy, if you have

08:03.358 --> 08:05.526
a stomach ache

08:05.568 --> 08:08.113
could you stay home

08:05.568 --> 08:08.113
from the slammer?

08:08.155 --> 08:11.325
Sweetheart, we're not

08:08.155 --> 08:11.325
going to the slammer.

08:11.366 --> 08:12.492
We're just going

08:11.366 --> 08:12.492
to return these bikes

08:12.533 --> 08:13.994
to their rightful owners.

08:14.035 --> 08:16.579
So, everybody gets

08:14.035 --> 08:16.579
their bike back except me?

08:16.621 --> 08:18.206
That's fair.

08:21.293 --> 08:22.836
How am I supposed

08:21.293 --> 08:22.836
to return this?

08:22.877 --> 08:24.754
I stole it off a kid

08:22.877 --> 08:24.754
named Davey.

08:24.796 --> 08:26.089
All I know about him

08:24.796 --> 08:26.089
is I should have stolen

08:26.131 --> 08:28.675
his trumpet too.

08:28.716 --> 08:31.136
I found mine

08:28.716 --> 08:31.136
leanin' against the library.

08:31.178 --> 08:33.138
It's such a horrible thing,

08:31.178 --> 08:33.138
a little girl goes in

08:33.180 --> 08:34.264
checks out "Curious George"

08:34.306 --> 08:36.141
comes out,

08:34.306 --> 08:36.141
her bike's gone.

08:36.183 --> 08:38.018
Could turn a kid off

08:36.183 --> 08:38.018
to reading forever.

08:39.853 --> 08:43.357
I grabbed mine

08:39.853 --> 08:43.357
off the back of a pickup.

08:43.398 --> 08:45.442
Oh, great,

08:43.398 --> 08:45.442
there's a card in it.

08:45.484 --> 08:48.569
"Happy birthday, Lisa.

08:45.484 --> 08:48.569
Love, mom and dad."

08:49.863 --> 08:50.822
[doorbell ringing]

08:50.864 --> 08:51.865
Joey, see

08:50.864 --> 08:51.865
who that is.

08:51.906 --> 08:53.325
Check

08:51.906 --> 08:53.325
through the window.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.121
It's that crime-catcher lady.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.121
Mrs. Caruthers.

08:58.163 --> 08:59.498
I'm getting my buns

08:58.163 --> 08:59.498
out of here.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.582
Joey, no, no, no,

08:59.539 --> 09:01.582
take-take the bikes.

09:01.624 --> 09:02.750
- Get 'em outta here.

09:01.624 --> 09:02.750
- Alright, okay.

09:02.792 --> 09:03.918
Hurry.

09:11.134 --> 09:12.427
10-4, out.

09:12.469 --> 09:14.304
Mr. Tanner, three more bikes

09:12.469 --> 09:14.304
have been stolen.

09:14.346 --> 09:16.223
We're going to set up

09:14.346 --> 09:16.223
our command post in your house.

09:16.264 --> 09:18.099
No, no, no,

09:16.264 --> 09:18.099
that's a bad idea.

09:18.141 --> 09:20.185
No, we're-we're not zoned

09:18.141 --> 09:20.185
for a command post here.

09:20.227 --> 09:23.188
Oh, horse feathers, this is

09:20.227 --> 09:23.188
the center of the crime wave.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.689
I'm surprised you

09:23.230 --> 09:24.689
haven't seen anything.

09:24.731 --> 09:26.858
Seen anything? No, why would

09:24.731 --> 09:26.858
I have seen something?

09:26.900 --> 09:28.693
Why, did somebody say

09:26.900 --> 09:28.693
they saw me see something.

09:28.735 --> 09:30.111
No, no, no, because,

09:28.735 --> 09:30.111
for example

09:30.153 --> 09:33.114
there-there's nothing

09:30.153 --> 09:33.114
going on in-in my kitchen?

09:33.156 --> 09:34.741
'Is it getting warm in here?'

09:34.782 --> 09:36.326
'It should be because I have

09:34.782 --> 09:36.326
nothing to hide, I mean..'

09:36.368 --> 09:37.869
Think she's suspicious?

09:37.911 --> 09:39.371
Why would she be?

09:39.413 --> 09:41.540
All Danny's doing is

09:39.413 --> 09:41.540
making a full confession.

09:41.581 --> 09:42.749
Okay, don't panic.

09:42.790 --> 09:45.585
All we have to do

09:42.790 --> 09:45.585
is just remain cool.

09:45.626 --> 09:47.170
Guys?

09:48.213 --> 09:49.881
Sorry.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.091
I put the boys down for a nap

09:51.132 --> 09:53.260
I must have conked out myself.

09:53.301 --> 09:54.344
Hey, what did you guys do

09:54.386 --> 09:55.429
rip off a bike store?

09:55.470 --> 09:58.265
- Hey, hey, hey.

09:55.470 --> 09:58.265
- Shh, shh, shh.

09:58.306 --> 09:59.266
I stole mine off a kid

09:59.307 --> 10:00.308
and he stole his

09:59.307 --> 10:00.308
off a truck.

10:00.350 --> 10:02.561
- Yeah.

10:00.350 --> 10:02.561
- What?

10:02.602 --> 10:04.062
[banging on door]

10:04.104 --> 10:07.399
Open up. It's crime-catchers,

10:04.104 --> 10:07.399
official business.

10:07.441 --> 10:08.525
That's Gibbler.

10:08.567 --> 10:09.568
Hide the bikes.

10:09.609 --> 10:10.735
Uh, listen,

10:09.609 --> 10:10.735
you saw nothing

10:10.777 --> 10:12.237
and you heard nothing.

10:12.279 --> 10:13.530
I know nothing.

10:13.572 --> 10:14.697
That's my girl.

10:17.825 --> 10:19.202
Didn't we used to have

10:17.825 --> 10:19.202
a rule around here

10:19.244 --> 10:20.579
"No bikes in the house"?

10:25.959 --> 10:27.502
Thank you, Mrs. Good hair.

10:27.544 --> 10:30.130
Alright, let's get set up.

10:30.171 --> 10:31.172
You can't catch a criminal

10:31.214 --> 10:32.966
without the right equipment.

10:33.007 --> 10:34.717
Fax machine.

10:34.759 --> 10:36.136
Cell phone.

10:36.177 --> 10:37.720
Map of crime sector.

10:37.762 --> 10:38.805

10:38.846 --> 10:41.933
Kimmy, what is this,

10:38.846 --> 10:41.933
the Batcave?

10:41.975 --> 10:44.144
No, It's your basic

10:41.975 --> 10:44.144
crime-catchers

10:44.185 --> 10:46.271
mobile-headquarters kit.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.315
Do you realize that

10:46.313 --> 10:48.315
four bikes have been stolen

10:48.356 --> 10:49.524
in our neighborhood.

10:49.566 --> 10:50.650
Really?

10:50.691 --> 10:51.985
I would have guessed three.

10:55.905 --> 10:57.073
Hi, Becky.

10:57.115 --> 11:01.161
Oh, Nicky, call me mommy.

11:01.202 --> 11:03.622
You didn't give me

11:01.202 --> 11:03.622
a flower on Becky's day.

11:05.957 --> 11:07.626
I see bikes.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.170
Did he just say

11:10.211 --> 11:11.379
"I see bikes?"

11:11.421 --> 11:13.131
I see bikes?

11:13.173 --> 11:15.758
No, of course not,

11:13.173 --> 11:15.758
he said

11:15.800 --> 11:16.926
"I see bites."

11:16.968 --> 11:18.512
Ha, those mosquitoes

11:18.553 --> 11:20.805
are just out

11:18.553 --> 11:20.805
of control, huh?

11:20.847 --> 11:23.975
Well, I got to get some

11:20.847 --> 11:23.975
Calamine lotion, Ta ta.

11:25.684 --> 11:27.270
(Danny)

11:25.684 --> 11:27.270
'Ma'am, you can't go in there.'

11:27.312 --> 11:29.939
Move 'em!

11:36.904 --> 11:38.573
Well, I miss The Jefferson's,

11:36.904 --> 11:38.573
don't you?

11:38.615 --> 11:40.699
How many Lionels were there?

11:38.615 --> 11:40.699
Do you remember?

11:40.741 --> 11:43.453
One mystery at a time,

11:40.741 --> 11:43.453
Mr. Tanner.

11:43.495 --> 11:46.122
Hey, how's that command post

11:43.495 --> 11:46.122
coming, Deputy Gibbler?

11:46.164 --> 11:48.833
We're cookin', chief.

11:50.293 --> 11:52.086
check this out

11:52.128 --> 11:54.047

That's why we're here,

11:54.088 --> 11:56.508

11:56.550 --> 11:59.344
What a comfort,

11:56.550 --> 11:59.344
Slim Jim.

11:59.386 --> 12:00.719
Hey, Mr. Tanner,

11:59.386 --> 12:00.719
look at this.

12:00.761 --> 12:02.138
Little Ruthy Bell

12:00.761 --> 12:02.138
went in to get

12:02.180 --> 12:03.181
her very first library card.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.891
Some goon nabbed her bike.

12:04.932 --> 12:07.268
Says here, "She's lost

12:04.932 --> 12:07.268
her zest for reading."

12:10.063 --> 12:11.939
She's zestless?

12:11.981 --> 12:13.024
Ya, and look at this guy

12:13.066 --> 12:14.693
who took

12:13.066 --> 12:14.693
The Schultz' bike.

12:16.819 --> 12:18.363
He looks like Uncle--

12:18.405 --> 12:20.156
Uncle Seymour, yes,

12:18.405 --> 12:20.156
that looks exactly like

12:20.198 --> 12:22.325
Uncle Seymour,

12:20.198 --> 12:22.325
but, uh, you know

12:22.367 --> 12:23.910
and-and if he weren't

12:22.367 --> 12:23.910
a priest in Athens

12:23.951 --> 12:26.705
he would be a suspect,

12:23.951 --> 12:26.705
yes, he would.

12:26.745 --> 12:28.039
Get these up

12:26.745 --> 12:28.039
to Uncle Seymour right away.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.708
- Uncle Who?

12:28.081 --> 12:29.708
- Just do it.

12:32.460 --> 12:33.752
Where are they?

12:33.794 --> 12:34.795
Oh, the flyers?

12:34.837 --> 12:37.382
Oh, you just missed them.

12:38.717 --> 12:40.885
Alright, okay,

12:38.717 --> 12:40.885
uh, how 'bout this?

12:40.927 --> 12:43.804
- Alright.

12:40.927 --> 12:43.804
- We dismantle the bikes.

12:43.846 --> 12:46.849
We put all the parts

12:43.846 --> 12:46.849
down our pants

12:46.891 --> 12:50.103
and we just walk right past

12:46.891 --> 12:50.103
everyone downstairs.

12:50.144 --> 12:52.647
Okay, alright, that's not bad,

12:50.144 --> 12:52.647
but here's a little twist.

12:52.689 --> 12:53.732
We don't touch the bikes.

12:53.772 --> 12:54.899
We don't touch our pants

12:54.941 --> 12:56.067
and you get over there

12:54.941 --> 12:56.067
and shut up

12:56.109 --> 12:58.737
until Groundhog day.

13:00.363 --> 13:02.449
What are these

13:00.363 --> 13:02.449
bikes doing here?

13:02.490 --> 13:04.659
You're Uncle Seymour.

13:04.701 --> 13:06.620
I thought

13:04.701 --> 13:06.620
he was in Greece.

13:06.661 --> 13:08.079
Let me see that.

13:08.121 --> 13:09.539
It doesn't look

13:08.121 --> 13:09.539
anything like me.

13:09.581 --> 13:11.750
The sideburns are

13:09.581 --> 13:11.750
totally unbalanced.

13:12.791 --> 13:14.877
Well, I'm going to pack.

13:14.919 --> 13:15.920
Where you goin'?

13:15.962 --> 13:18.256
The slammer.

13:18.298 --> 13:20.759
These, uh, posters have

13:18.298 --> 13:20.759
addresses on them.

13:20.799 --> 13:22.969
Oh, yeah, yeah, they do,

13:20.799 --> 13:22.969
you know what, this is perfect.

13:23.010 --> 13:25.096
You know, we'll take all the

13:23.010 --> 13:25.096
bikes back to these addresses.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.556
We'll get everything back

13:25.138 --> 13:26.556
to normal around here, okay.

13:26.598 --> 13:27.515
Everybody grab a bike.

13:27.557 --> 13:28.558
- Okay.

13:27.557 --> 13:28.558
- Alright.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.101
- Let's go.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.101
- Wait.

13:30.143 --> 13:31.645
The crime-catchers

13:30.143 --> 13:31.645
are in the kitchen.

13:31.686 --> 13:32.687
Alright, we'll go out

13:31.686 --> 13:32.687

13:32.729 --> 13:34.481
- Okay.

13:32.729 --> 13:34.481
- Let's go.

13:34.522 --> 13:35.814
Come on, move it.

13:35.856 --> 13:37.191
Hey, uh, how come you

13:35.856 --> 13:37.191
don't have a bike?

13:37.233 --> 13:38.485
'Cause I'm carrying

13:37.233 --> 13:38.485
the flyers.

13:38.526 --> 13:39.778
- Move, move, move.

13:38.526 --> 13:39.778
- Oh.

13:42.363 --> 13:44.616
- Come on, let's go.

13:42.363 --> 13:44.616
- Hurry, hurry, hurry.

13:44.658 --> 13:45.866
Shh.

13:49.579 --> 13:51.872
So, uh, Jesse, do you think

13:49.579 --> 13:51.872
we can pull this off?

13:51.914 --> 13:52.957
Absolutely.

13:52.999 --> 13:54.041
[doorbell ringing]

13:54.083 --> 13:55.918
Not.

13:54.083 --> 13:55.918
Alright, Joey, say, ah.

13:55.960 --> 13:58.045
- Why?

13:55.960 --> 13:58.045
- Perfect.

13:58.087 --> 14:00.423
Get back, go, back.

Shh.

14:09.848 --> 14:12.477
Yeah, what do you want..

14:13.936 --> 14:16.564
I'm Leonard Schultz,

14:13.936 --> 14:16.564
Davey's father.

14:16.606 --> 14:18.358
I'm looking for some guy

14:16.606 --> 14:18.358
named Jesse.

14:18.399 --> 14:20.360
He took my kid's bike.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.989
He looks exactly like you.

14:25.031 --> 14:27.283
Oh, no, no, no, this doesn't

14:25.031 --> 14:27.283
look anything like me.

14:27.325 --> 14:28.868
Look, sideburns, uneven.

14:28.909 --> 14:32.497
Mine, totally even,

14:28.909 --> 14:32.497
see how that works?

14:32.539 --> 14:34.123
- Sorry.

14:32.539 --> 14:34.123
- Yeah, okay, it's alright.

14:34.165 --> 14:35.709
So, who are you,

14:34.165 --> 14:35.709
anyway?

14:35.750 --> 14:37.669
I am, uh,

14:35.750 --> 14:37.669
I'm Joey.

14:37.711 --> 14:40.880
Well, Joey, I'm going

14:37.711 --> 14:40.880
to sit right over here

14:40.921 --> 14:44.467
and wait for this

14:40.921 --> 14:44.467
Jesse punk to show up.

14:44.509 --> 14:45.510
There's a couple of things

14:45.552 --> 14:47.094
I want to impress upon him.

14:47.136 --> 14:49.055
Oh, yeah?

14:47.136 --> 14:49.055
Like, uh, like what?

14:49.096 --> 14:52.433
Like my left fist

14:49.096 --> 14:52.433
and my right.

14:52.475 --> 14:53.476
Hey.

14:53.518 --> 14:55.186
Uh, uh, Danny.

14:55.228 --> 14:56.604
Danny, Danny.

14:56.646 --> 14:58.523
Hi, it's me,

14:56.646 --> 14:58.523
your old pal, Joey.

14:59.148 --> 15:00.817
<i>Pardonnez-moi?</i>

15:00.859 --> 15:02.068
Hey, let me explain.

15:02.109 --> 15:04.404
This is, this here is

15:02.109 --> 15:04.404
Leonard Schultz.

15:04.445 --> 15:05.905
He's Davey's father.

15:05.946 --> 15:08.032
And for some whacky reason

15:05.946 --> 15:08.032
he seems to think

15:08.074 --> 15:09.534
that Jesse's stolen

15:08.074 --> 15:09.534
his kid's bike

15:09.576 --> 15:12.036
and Jesse's nowhere

15:09.576 --> 15:12.036
to be found, thank God

15:12.078 --> 15:15.122
because, um, Leonard here

15:12.078 --> 15:15.122
has a bone to pick with him

15:15.164 --> 15:18.000
and-and we all know

15:15.164 --> 15:18.000
how painful

15:18.042 --> 15:19.878
bone-picking can be.

15:20.670 --> 15:21.629
Joey.

15:21.671 --> 15:22.839
- Yeah.

15:21.671 --> 15:22.839
- Yes.

15:22.881 --> 15:25.550
Oh, she was calling for you

15:25.592 --> 15:26.551
wasn't she, Joey?

15:26.593 --> 15:29.512
Yes, she was, Danny.

15:29.554 --> 15:30.847
Could I play?

15:30.889 --> 15:33.641
I want to be...DJ.

15:33.683 --> 15:35.393
Uh, no , no, look,

15:33.683 --> 15:35.393
no, time for playing now.

15:35.435 --> 15:39.063
This is-this is Leonard Schultz,

15:35.435 --> 15:39.063
Davey's father.

15:39.105 --> 15:40.899
- Davey's father?

15:39.105 --> 15:40.899
- Hm-hmm.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.861
Uh, got to go.

15:44.903 --> 15:46.362
Wait, who's Davey?

15:46.404 --> 15:49.115
Somebody

15:46.404 --> 15:49.115
with a<i> really big dad.</i>

15:53.035 --> 15:55.455
Okay, we've got to get

15:53.035 --> 15:55.455
Davey's bike back

15:55.496 --> 15:58.124
before his dad

15:55.496 --> 15:58.124
smushes Uncle Jesse.

15:59.208 --> 16:00.919
You should see

15:59.208 --> 16:00.919
this guy, phew.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.963
There'll be nothing left

16:00.960 --> 16:03.963
but a puddle of mousse.

16:04.004 --> 16:07.049
So, how do we get

16:04.004 --> 16:07.049
the bikes outta here?

16:07.091 --> 16:08.175
I've got a plan.

16:08.217 --> 16:09.677
Okay, but I'm not stuffing

16:09.719 --> 16:11.638
bike parts down my pants.

16:15.057 --> 16:17.017
For the hundredth time,

16:15.057 --> 16:17.017
I don't know anything.

16:17.059 --> 16:19.646
- I don't believe you.

16:17.059 --> 16:19.646
- It's the truth, I tell you!

16:19.687 --> 16:21.063
You mean to tell me

16:21.105 --> 16:22.649
that Joey's never

16:21.105 --> 16:22.649
mentioned me

16:22.690 --> 16:24.400
I mean, not even in passing

16:22.690 --> 16:24.400
or maybe at lunch?

16:24.442 --> 16:25.568
[scanner beeping]

16:25.610 --> 16:26.861
Oh, my scanner!

16:32.867 --> 16:34.368
Hey, everybody.

16:34.410 --> 16:35.745
Uh, Stephanie

16:34.410 --> 16:35.745
has a card trick

16:35.787 --> 16:36.871
she wants

16:35.787 --> 16:36.871
to show you all.

16:36.913 --> 16:39.499
I wish I could

16:36.913 --> 16:39.499
stay to see it.

16:39.540 --> 16:41.626
Steph, this is

16:39.540 --> 16:41.626
not a good time.

16:41.668 --> 16:43.670
Trust me, dad,

16:41.668 --> 16:43.670
it is.

16:44.671 --> 16:47.089
Okay, prepare

16:44.671 --> 16:47.089
to be amazed.

16:47.131 --> 16:49.258
Kimmy, pick a card,

16:47.131 --> 16:49.258
memorize it

16:49.300 --> 16:50.760
'and put it back

16:49.300 --> 16:50.760
in the deck.'

16:54.263 --> 16:58.100
Five of clubs,

16:54.263 --> 16:58.100
five of clubs.

16:58.142 --> 17:02.396
Okay, now,

16:58.142 --> 17:02.396
watch me shuffle.

17:02.438 --> 17:04.524
See me shuffling,

17:02.438 --> 17:04.524
shuffle, shuffle.

17:04.565 --> 17:06.734
'The magic shuffle.'

17:06.776 --> 17:08.319
Now, notice, that at no time

17:08.361 --> 17:10.780
do my fingers leave

17:08.361 --> 17:10.780
my hands.

17:10.822 --> 17:12.239
Shuffling, look--

17:12.281 --> 17:13.741
We don't have time

17:12.281 --> 17:13.741
for this poppycock!

17:13.783 --> 17:16.577
Nonsense! There's

17:13.783 --> 17:16.577
always time for poppycock.

17:16.619 --> 17:18.538
Just play, uh, watch the trick,

17:16.619 --> 17:18.538
it's an excellent trick.

17:18.579 --> 17:21.457
- Steph, go, go, go.

17:18.579 --> 17:21.457
- Okay, Kimmy..

17:21.499 --> 17:24.544
Is<i> this</i> your card?

17:24.585 --> 17:26.170
No.

17:27.005 --> 17:29.256
Is<i> this</i> your card?

17:29.298 --> 17:30.383
No.

17:30.424 --> 17:32.760
'Is<i> this</i> your card?'

17:32.802 --> 17:34.136
[crashing]

17:34.178 --> 17:35.471
- Oh!

17:34.178 --> 17:35.471
- Hey, hey.

17:35.513 --> 17:37.765
Oh! Excellent trick,

17:35.513 --> 17:37.765
excellent trick!

17:37.807 --> 17:40.059
That was fabulous!

17:40.100 --> 17:42.687
Well, she didn't

17:40.100 --> 17:42.687
even find my card.

17:42.729 --> 17:43.938
Hey, Mr. Tanner.

17:43.980 --> 17:45.481
Look, I hope you

17:43.980 --> 17:45.481
weren't too attached

17:45.523 --> 17:47.025
to that big,

17:45.523 --> 17:47.025
ceramic planter.

17:50.069 --> 17:53.614
Blondie, that was the worst

17:50.069 --> 17:53.614
card trick I ever saw.

17:53.656 --> 17:56.075
Okay, Kimmy, if you would

17:56.116 --> 17:58.285
please check

17:56.116 --> 17:58.285
your pockets.

18:00.997 --> 18:03.332
All I have here

18:00.997 --> 18:03.332
is some gum.

18:03.374 --> 18:04.667
Thank you

18:03.374 --> 18:04.667
and goodnight.

18:05.752 --> 18:08.963
Oh, bravo,

18:05.752 --> 18:08.963
excellent trick.

18:09.005 --> 18:12.967
So, that's why I retired

18:09.005 --> 18:12.967
from the ring.

18:13.009 --> 18:16.637
Wow. You quit boxing 'cause it

18:13.009 --> 18:16.637
wasn't violent enough.

18:18.639 --> 18:20.850
Fascinating story,

18:18.639 --> 18:20.850
huh, Joey?

18:25.187 --> 18:26.606
Yeah, Danny, I'm..

18:26.647 --> 18:28.441
...shaking

18:26.647 --> 18:28.441
with fascination.

18:30.359 --> 18:33.153
Hey, would somebody tell me

18:30.359 --> 18:33.153
what's going on with all the--

18:33.195 --> 18:34.280
Miss Donaldson.

18:34.321 --> 18:36.115
- Leonard.

18:34.321 --> 18:36.115
- Yeah.

18:36.156 --> 18:37.533
How do you two

18:36.156 --> 18:37.533
know each other?

18:37.575 --> 18:38.826
Leonard's my butcher.

18:38.868 --> 18:39.869
You should see

18:38.868 --> 18:39.869
what this guy

18:39.911 --> 18:41.287
can do

18:39.911 --> 18:41.287
with a cleaver.

18:44.874 --> 18:46.584
So, this is

18:44.874 --> 18:46.584
where you live?

18:46.626 --> 18:48.168
I always wanted

18:46.626 --> 18:48.168
to meet your husband.

18:48.210 --> 18:49.963
Uh, what was his name?

18:50.004 --> 18:52.048
Oh, Joey.

18:53.340 --> 18:57.177
Uh, yeah,

18:53.340 --> 18:57.177
that's right, Joey.

18:57.219 --> 19:01.181
Joey, that's my husband.

19:01.223 --> 19:02.976
This is my husband.

19:03.017 --> 19:04.351
I thought that was Danny?

19:04.393 --> 19:06.186
Ah, you didn't

19:04.393 --> 19:06.186
let me finish.

19:06.228 --> 19:11.275
This is my husband's

19:06.228 --> 19:11.275
best friend, Danny.

19:11.317 --> 19:13.152
And this is

19:11.317 --> 19:13.152
my husband, Joey?

19:13.193 --> 19:14.988
Right, hug, hug.

19:15.738 --> 19:18.074
Ah, she knows.

19:18.116 --> 19:19.241
I'm still Becky, right?

19:19.283 --> 19:21.410
Yeah, yeah.

19:22.202 --> 19:23.997
Jesse, Jesse.

19:25.205 --> 19:28.584
Hey, that kid's

19:25.205 --> 19:28.584
calling you Jesse.

19:28.626 --> 19:31.629
Uh, no, it's just-it's just

19:28.626 --> 19:31.629
a crazy little phase

19:31.671 --> 19:32.672
he's going through.

19:32.713 --> 19:34.090
It's-It's nutty, you know.

19:34.132 --> 19:37.176
Last week, he was calling

19:34.132 --> 19:37.176
everyone Frankie.

19:37.217 --> 19:40.721
Now, young man, you know

19:37.217 --> 19:40.721
my name isn't Jesse.

19:40.763 --> 19:42.515
Jesse, I love you.

19:53.359 --> 19:55.028
Leonard, I'm

19:53.359 --> 19:55.028
not going to lie

19:55.069 --> 19:56.654
in front of my kid.

19:58.238 --> 19:59.448
I'm Jesse.

19:59.490 --> 20:00.700
Not for long.

20:00.741 --> 20:02.451
No, no, no.

20:00.741 --> 20:02.451
Leonard, Leonard, Leonard!

20:02.493 --> 20:05.204
Leonard, put him down.

20:05.245 --> 20:06.288
What's going on in here?

20:06.330 --> 20:07.874
This guy stole my kid's bike.

20:07.915 --> 20:09.834
No, no, no, this whole

20:07.915 --> 20:09.834
thing is big misunderstanding.

20:09.876 --> 20:11.251
The bikes are upstairs.

20:11.711 --> 20:12.795
Oh.

20:13.754 --> 20:14.755
Why didn't you say so?

20:14.797 --> 20:16.841
'Cause I couldn't breathe.

20:16.883 --> 20:19.635
Uh, Jess, um..

20:19.677 --> 20:21.261
The bikes aren't upstairs.

20:21.303 --> 20:23.890
- Goin' up.

20:21.303 --> 20:23.890
- No, no, no.

20:23.931 --> 20:26.225
I meant that right now, they're

20:23.931 --> 20:26.225
being, they're being returned

20:26.266 --> 20:27.643
to their rightful

20:26.266 --> 20:27.643
owners right now.

20:27.685 --> 20:30.146
Oh, uh, DJ, Steve

20:30.188 --> 20:31.313
this is Leonard Schultz.

20:31.355 --> 20:33.524
He is looking

20:31.355 --> 20:33.524
for his kid's bike.

20:34.984 --> 20:36.318
Bike?

20:36.360 --> 20:40.156
Uh, uh, DJ, do you know

20:36.360 --> 20:40.156
anything about a-a bike?

20:40.198 --> 20:42.783
Uh, I used

20:40.198 --> 20:42.783
to have a bike.

20:45.119 --> 20:47.329
Lift off.

20:47.371 --> 20:49.248
Leonard, Leonard, Leonard.

20:50.416 --> 20:52.668
People, attention!

20:52.710 --> 20:53.711
The bikes are back.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.796
Oh, thank God.

20:55.838 --> 20:57.381
It just came in

20:55.838 --> 20:57.381
on the scanner.

20:57.423 --> 20:59.425
All the bikes have

20:57.423 --> 20:59.425
been returned to their owners.

20:59.466 --> 21:00.843
See, Leonard?

20:59.466 --> 21:00.843
No harm done.

21:00.885 --> 21:03.971
Yeah, just

21:00.885 --> 21:03.971
a few ribs broken.

21:04.013 --> 21:05.139
Sorry, buddy.

21:05.181 --> 21:07.474
Yeah, yeah,

21:05.181 --> 21:07.474
that's okay, Leonard.

21:07.516 --> 21:10.019
- Yeah!

21:07.516 --> 21:10.019
- Ah! Ah! Ah!

21:10.061 --> 21:11.311
Leonard, Leonard,

21:10.061 --> 21:11.311
the hair.

21:11.353 --> 21:12.855
I know it's not

21:11.353 --> 21:12.855
your thing, but..

21:14.065 --> 21:15.942
Let's mark this

21:14.065 --> 21:15.942
"Case closed."

21:15.983 --> 21:17.443
- Yeah.

21:15.983 --> 21:17.443
- Alright.

21:17.484 --> 21:19.070
Wait a minute,

21:17.484 --> 21:19.070
wait a minute.

21:19.112 --> 21:20.571
The case isn't closed.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.406
My bike's still stolen.

21:22.448 --> 21:25.409
'No, it isn't.'

21:28.662 --> 21:30.581
My Kermit sticker.

21:31.707 --> 21:33.834
This is my bike.

21:33.876 --> 21:36.879
You left it at my house

21:33.876 --> 21:36.879
last week, remember?

21:36.921 --> 21:39.132
It was raining

21:36.921 --> 21:39.132
cats and dogs.

21:39.173 --> 21:41.341
Mother gave you

21:39.173 --> 21:41.341
a ride home.

21:41.383 --> 21:42.635
Oh, yeah.

21:42.676 --> 21:44.262
I forgot.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.430
My bike's been

21:44.303 --> 21:46.430
at your house, the whole time.

21:46.472 --> 21:48.182
Isn't that funny?

21:54.563 --> 21:56.899
Oh, yeah, funny

21:54.563 --> 21:56.899
isn't the word for it.

21:56.941 --> 21:59.068
Okay, since we caused

21:56.941 --> 21:59.068
everybody so much trouble

21:59.110 --> 22:01.320
I'm taking everyone out

21:59.110 --> 22:01.320
for frozen yogurt.

22:01.361 --> 22:03.197
- Alright.

22:03.239 --> 22:04.490
With sprinkles?

22:05.491 --> 22:06.826
You got it, big guy.

22:06.867 --> 22:08.744
Alright, let's go.

22:08.786 --> 22:10.412
Hey, Deej,

22:08.786 --> 22:10.412
could you take Nicky

22:10.454 --> 22:12.623
while I go upstairs

22:10.454 --> 22:12.623
and get Alex.

22:14.458 --> 22:15.668
- Uh, Joey.

22:14.458 --> 22:15.668
- Hey.

22:15.709 --> 22:17.377
Now that this

22:15.709 --> 22:17.377
is all over.

22:17.419 --> 22:19.379
I think you should be

22:17.419 --> 22:19.379
de-briefed.

22:24.593 --> 22:28.097
You know, I really don..

22:24.593 --> 22:28.097
I don't like the sound of that.

22:28.139 --> 22:29.307
Excuse me.

22:29.347 --> 22:31.225
Ruff ruff.

22:32.185 --> 22:34.103
Crazy day, huh, Michelle?

22:34.145 --> 22:35.313
Yeah, I'm

22:34.145 --> 22:35.313
sorry I made

22:35.353 --> 22:37.648
everybody look

22:35.353 --> 22:37.648
for my bike.

22:37.690 --> 22:39.441
Oh, that's okay,

22:37.690 --> 22:39.441
sweetheart.

22:39.483 --> 22:41.235
We did it

22:39.483 --> 22:41.235
'cause we love you.

22:41.277 --> 22:42.862
Next time,

22:41.277 --> 22:42.862
I'll try to remember

22:42.903 --> 22:44.362
where I put my stuff.

22:44.404 --> 22:45.781
Very good.

22:47.200 --> 22:48.993
Now, come on, let's go get

22:47.200 --> 22:48.993
some ice cream.

22:51.411 --> 22:53.622
Hey, where's my jacket?

22:53.664 --> 22:55.582
It was right there!

22:55.624 --> 22:58.252
Somebody stole it.

22:59.628 --> 23:01.881
Michelle.

23:01.922 --> 23:03.590
Oh, never mind.

23:12.725 --> 23:15.811
