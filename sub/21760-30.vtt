Ah, this is gonna be

01:11.460 --> 01:14.040
a great snow-camping trip,
Pongo.

01:14.040 --> 01:16.960
Ugh! They're
going camping!

01:19.120 --> 01:22.040
Yep, just you and me,
manly men,

01:22.040 --> 01:24.880
asserting ourselves
against Mother Nature.

01:24.880 --> 01:26.460
Oh!

01:34.540 --> 01:36.000
Can we go, Dad?

01:36.000 --> 01:38.080
Please!

01:38.080 --> 01:40.960
Sorry, Lucky, this trip
is for dogly dogs,

01:40.960 --> 01:42.500
not puply pups.

01:42.500 --> 01:44.580
You haven't developed
the proper skills

01:44.580 --> 01:46.580
to survive
in the wild.

01:46.580 --> 01:49.170
Well, at least you tried.

01:49.170 --> 01:52.080
Hey, I'm just
getting started!

01:52.080 --> 01:55.880
We sneak along, prove we can
survive in the wild,

01:55.880 --> 01:58.540
and boom,
we're big enough to go camping.

01:58.540 --> 02:01.250
I admire your proactive spirit,
Lucky.

02:01.250 --> 02:04.000
But if this goes wrong,
you're taking the fall.

02:09.580 --> 02:10.920
Ha-ha-ha!

02:10.920 --> 02:12.710
Here we are, Pongo.

02:12.710 --> 02:15.210
surrounded by nature's
tranquility.

02:15.210 --> 02:17.380
Out of life's fast lane.

02:30.250 --> 02:33.460
Hey, that looked like...
Could that be...?

02:33.460 --> 02:35.580
Nah, impossible.

02:41.330 --> 02:42.670
Perfect!

02:42.670 --> 02:44.290
This is just
the backdrop I need

02:44.290 --> 02:47.790
for my new line of mail-order
Mountain Fashions.

02:47.790 --> 02:50.790
Oh, just look
at the beautiful scenery!

02:51.960 --> 02:53.040
Horace: C-c-can't.

02:53.040 --> 02:55.380
My eyes need defrosting.

03:00.040 --> 03:03.040
Quit lying down on the job
and unpack the gear!

03:03.040 --> 03:04.040
Uggh!

03:16.620 --> 03:20.330
C-could we have the front seat
on the way back, maybe?

03:20.330 --> 03:23.330
What? And let
this freezing weather

03:23.330 --> 03:24.620
chap the leather trim?

03:24.620 --> 03:26.420
What kind of monster
are you?!

03:29.830 --> 03:31.000
Ah! There.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.210
Now what say we rustle up
a manly lunch, eh, Pongo?

03:37.420 --> 03:40.250
I'll get
the salad spinner.

03:43.420 --> 03:46.420
Hey, do you remember
where I put that thing?

03:46.420 --> 03:48.830
Ahh! Here it is.

03:51.830 --> 03:53.880
Aah! Whoa!

03:58.790 --> 04:00.250
-Aaaah!

04:00.250 --> 04:03.000
-Banzai!

04:06.620 --> 04:08.250
Oooh!

04:08.250 --> 04:11.250
What survival skill
do we try first?

04:11.250 --> 04:13.460
Oh, we can survive later.

04:13.460 --> 04:15.790
Right now let's have some fun.

04:17.710 --> 04:19.960
Hey, wait for me!

04:21.750 --> 04:24.380
Ready on the set,
Miss De Vil.

04:24.380 --> 04:27.790
My polar poncho
should be a hot seller.

04:27.790 --> 04:31.830
The complete ensemble comes
with nuclear-powered footwear...

04:33.750 --> 04:35.210
...electric blanket coat...

04:36.960 --> 04:39.620
and a solar bun warmer.

04:46.710 --> 04:48.880
Hey, who wants to go sledding?

04:48.880 --> 04:49.880
Not me.

04:49.880 --> 04:50.960
Waaaah!

04:50.960 --> 04:53.500
Whoa!

04:53.500 --> 04:55.790
Hey, I'm not
seein' nothin'.

04:55.790 --> 04:58.250
Let me look.

04:58.250 --> 05:00.330
Whoa!

05:05.790 --> 05:08.460
Aaaaah!

05:08.460 --> 05:11.380
You left the lens cap on,
doofus.

05:11.380 --> 05:15.250
Horace:
Hey, where's the boss?

05:15.250 --> 05:17.920
Aaaaaah!

05:22.830 --> 05:25.790
Why, you photo saboteurs!

05:25.790 --> 05:27.670
puppies: Aaaaah!

05:31.670 --> 05:33.580
Whoaaaa!

05:33.580 --> 05:38.750
Get me out of here,
you croutons!

05:38.750 --> 05:40.540
...croutons...

05:40.540 --> 05:42.420
...croutons...

05:42.420 --> 05:44.380
She's over there.

05:44.380 --> 05:46.080
No, she's over there.

05:46.080 --> 05:48.920
She's everywhere!
Hold me!

05:48.920 --> 05:50.960
Where are those lug nuts?

05:50.960 --> 05:54.250
And why isn't
this thing heating?

05:54.250 --> 05:58.210
I hope those overpaid urchins
made my tent right.

06:02.710 --> 06:06.170
Ah, the House of De Vil
Terra Tent.

06:06.170 --> 06:08.710
For those who rough it in style.

06:08.710 --> 06:10.880
Where's the east wing?

06:10.880 --> 06:13.420
That's where the hot tub is.

06:13.420 --> 06:16.290
Oh, I'll have to
blow it up myself.

06:26.500 --> 06:28.750
Rolly: Do you think
she's all right?

06:28.750 --> 06:31.830
Cadpig: Oh, if anyone can
scare off the angel of death,

06:31.830 --> 06:33.210
it's Cruella.

06:33.210 --> 06:35.000
Maybe if we help her
blow up the tent,

06:35.000 --> 06:37.080
she'll let us inside.

06:56.250 --> 06:58.330
Oh!

06:58.330 --> 07:00.000
Get away from it,
you mongrels.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.500
You'll puncture it
with your claws.

07:03.500 --> 07:06.830
I'll send up
a quick flare signal
before I soak in the tub.

07:07.880 --> 07:10.710
This should get the attention
of those nitwits.

07:13.420 --> 07:14.960
We needed the carrot
for the nose.

07:14.960 --> 07:16.710
Hey, Jasper, look!

07:16.710 --> 07:18.000
Fireworks!

07:18.000 --> 07:21.120
Aha! Pretty!

07:24.880 --> 07:26.000
Uh-oh.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.580
Someone's in trouble,
Pongo.

07:27.580 --> 07:30.000
Our wieners
will have to wait.

07:37.120 --> 07:38.420
Ugggh!

07:40.000 --> 07:43.080
-Oooh!
-Ahhh!

07:49.670 --> 07:51.750
It feels like
a blizzard's coming.

07:51.750 --> 07:55.580
My g-giblets
are freezing.

07:55.580 --> 07:59.210
I've got to find shelter.
But how?

08:04.250 --> 08:06.040
Hmm.

08:07.620 --> 08:09.960
Mush, you mutts!

08:29.920 --> 08:31.620
Salvation!

08:42.500 --> 08:45.080
I'm not in the mood.

08:50.290 --> 08:52.170
Ahh, if I only had a fire,

08:52.170 --> 08:54.290
this place wouldn't be
too abysmal.

08:54.290 --> 08:56.330
Where's my lighter?

08:56.330 --> 08:59.000
In my purse!
Where's my purse?!

08:59.000 --> 09:01.670
She dropped it
back where we fell.

09:01.670 --> 09:02.710
Let's go get it.

09:02.710 --> 09:04.040
Are you nuts?

09:04.040 --> 09:05.960
In this
gizzard-freezing
blizzard?

09:05.960 --> 09:07.540
I'm staying here.

09:07.540 --> 09:10.580
We've got to work together
to get through this.

09:10.580 --> 09:13.580
He's right.
We've got to prioritize.

09:13.580 --> 09:15.540
Survive now...

09:15.540 --> 09:17.790
bury him in blame later.

09:56.880 --> 09:58.290
My purse!

09:58.290 --> 10:00.210
Give it to me,
you purse snatchers!

10:00.210 --> 10:03.210
If I survive this,
I'll press charges.

10:12.460 --> 10:16.420
Oh, all right, but stay
on your side of the fire.

10:16.420 --> 10:19.250
I don't want you absorbing
any heat from my side.

10:37.830 --> 10:39.540
You hear that,
Pongo?

10:46.580 --> 10:49.540
Cruella?
What are you doing here?

10:49.540 --> 10:52.580
Oh, uh...
saving your dogs!

10:52.580 --> 10:55.500
I kept them alive
with my body heat.

10:55.500 --> 10:57.250
You owe me!

10:57.250 --> 10:59.580
Lucky, what are you
doing here?

10:59.580 --> 11:01.540
Uh, surviving.

11:01.540 --> 11:03.380
Yeah, I told you
we could do it.

11:03.380 --> 11:04.750
We all
worked together

11:04.750 --> 11:06.250
and survived
the blizzard.

11:07.290 --> 11:10.000
You also disobeyed me.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.500
You're all grounded
for a week.

11:12.500 --> 11:13.380
Awww!

11:13.380 --> 11:15.670
That's cruel
and unusual.

11:15.670 --> 11:18.880
Oh, you'll survive it
if you work together.

11:18.880 --> 11:22.920
Now, where are
those ex

11:26.880 --> 11:29.540
S-sure is a slow
fireworks show.

11:29.540 --> 11:32.380
Yeah, when's
the grand finale?

11:33.420 --> 11:36.500
Aaaaah!

11:44.500 --> 11:46.540
Oh, my stomach.

11:46.540 --> 11:48.120
Growling.

11:48.120 --> 11:51.040
Blood sugar low.

11:51.040 --> 11:53.790
Starvation near.

11:53.790 --> 11:56.290
Ohhh...

11:56.290 --> 11:58.460
Hey, what gives?

11:58.460 --> 12:02.460
I'm famished, and you bring me
stinky footwear?

12:02.460 --> 12:03.960
Puh-lease!

12:03.960 --> 12:05.670
It's the perfect snack.

12:05.670 --> 12:08.290
Did you want
some dipping sauce?

12:08.290 --> 12:11.330
Ptooey!
I never chew shoes.

12:11.330 --> 12:14.380
I'm a gourmette,
a kibble connoisseur,

12:14.380 --> 12:15.620
don't ya know.

12:15.620 --> 12:18.790
My taste buds
are, oh, so refined.

12:21.290 --> 12:22.380
Come on, let's go rummage

12:22.380 --> 12:24.460
through the garbage can
for scraps.

12:32.500 --> 12:33.710
Whoa!

12:37.290 --> 12:39.420
Anita!

12:39.420 --> 12:41.580
Come give me a hand
with these designs.

12:41.580 --> 12:43.790
Oh, of all
the filthy nuisances.

12:43.790 --> 12:46.420
Uggh! Ugh-ugh! Ugh-ugh!

12:50.380 --> 12:52.080
Ohh!

12:52.080 --> 12:53.170
Oh.

12:57.500 --> 12:59.460
Come on, help me
pull this thing loose.

12:59.460 --> 13:03.250
I thought you were too much
the "gourmette" to chew shoes.

13:03.250 --> 13:06.330
I'm not gonna chew it,
I'm gonna fetch it
to Cruella.

13:06.330 --> 13:09.250
Maybe my good deed
will earn me a handout.

13:09.250 --> 13:11.380
Yes, and maybe
the tooth fairy

13:11.380 --> 13:13.290
will fly away
to Lollipop Land

13:13.290 --> 13:15.170
and get a cavity.

13:21.460 --> 13:24.460
Italian leather.

13:25.960 --> 13:29.580
What a soft sock!
It's so supple.

13:35.250 --> 13:37.000
Roger: Rolly?

13:37.000 --> 13:38.290
Rolly?

13:38.290 --> 13:40.210
Rolly!

13:40.210 --> 13:43.290
Oh, no, tell me that isn't
Cruella's boot!

13:44.710 --> 13:48.040
Rolly, let...
Come on, let go!

13:49.080 --> 13:52.830
Cruella's gonna have a fit
when she sees this.

13:54.170 --> 13:56.380
Rolly, what got
into you?

13:57.420 --> 14:01.790
More...
Gotta have more!

14:01.790 --> 14:05.420
I wasn't aware you also kept
alligators as pets.

14:05.420 --> 14:07.920
I'm just so sorry,
Cruella.

14:07.920 --> 14:10.420
We'll pay to have it
replaced, of course.

14:10.420 --> 14:12.330
These boots are...

14:12.330 --> 14:15.420
were designer exclusives!

14:15.420 --> 14:17.170
Ha ha! I doubt you
can afford--

14:17.170 --> 14:18.380
Aaaaah!

14:19.960 --> 14:21.580
Whoaaaa!

14:21.580 --> 14:23.170
both: Rolly!

14:23.170 --> 14:25.960
Oww! Ohh! Aaah!

14:33.170 --> 14:34.790
Ohhhh!

14:37.330 --> 14:39.250
Stop that beast!

14:39.250 --> 14:42.210
Rolly, come back with that!

14:42.210 --> 14:46.250
I always knew those curs
were out to kill me.

14:46.250 --> 14:48.500
Well, you could
call them sandals.

14:50.210 --> 14:52.330
Oh, Rolly!

14:52.330 --> 14:55.040
I'll go get the checkbook.

14:56.920 --> 14:59.290
Cruella: You should have seen
Roger's face

14:59.290 --> 15:00.580
when he wrote the check.

15:00.580 --> 15:02.830
He almost swooned!

15:04.120 --> 15:06.290
I do believe the cost
of my boots

15:06.290 --> 15:08.790
wiped out
the Dearlys' checking account!

15:08.790 --> 15:11.580
Just one pair!

15:15.620 --> 15:19.120
Imagine if the Dearlys had to
replace my entire collection.

15:19.120 --> 15:21.750
Well, they'd be driven
to the poor house!

15:21.750 --> 15:23.250
That's it!

15:23.250 --> 15:26.750
If I could lure that
shoe-bespotted pup here,

15:26.750 --> 15:29.250
he would chew every shoe!

15:29.250 --> 15:31.620
The Dearlys could never
pay me back!

15:31.620 --> 15:34.290
They'd have to give me
their farm!

15:38.540 --> 15:42.830
Shoes...
Must have more shoes.

15:42.830 --> 15:45.670
But, Rolly, we just
ate 10 minutes ago.

15:45.670 --> 15:47.540
You had three helpings.

15:47.540 --> 15:51.420
I'm not hungry for kibble.
I want shoes.

15:51.420 --> 15:54.830
Expensive shoes,
Cruella shoes.

15:55.960 --> 15:57.920
Man, you are
hooked.

15:57.920 --> 16:01.250
Obsession is
an ugly thing, Rolly.

16:01.250 --> 16:02.500
But I--

16:02.500 --> 16:04.830
Shh!
I'm watching TV!

16:04.830 --> 16:08.620
Ah, you guys
just don't understand.

16:08.620 --> 16:11.420
The subtlety of a suede.

16:11.420 --> 16:14.250
The tease of the T-strap.

16:14.250 --> 16:17.330
The patina of patent leather!

16:17.330 --> 16:20.040
Ohhh, papa!

16:21.830 --> 16:23.080
Lucky: Shh!

16:26.250 --> 16:27.040
Huh?

16:53.210 --> 16:55.420
Hey, where did
Rolly go?

16:55.420 --> 16:58.250
Uh-oh, we should have
watched him closer.

16:58.250 --> 17:01.250
Face it, he's got
a fetish for footwear.

17:01.250 --> 17:03.080
We'd better find him.

17:09.920 --> 17:11.670
Huh?

17:19.080 --> 17:20.380
Aaaah!

17:20.380 --> 17:23.380
Hababababa...

17:24.790 --> 17:26.080
Cruella: Impressed?

17:26.080 --> 17:27.210
Huh?

17:27.210 --> 17:28.670
Oh, well, you should be.

17:28.670 --> 17:32.210
We seem to share a taste
for exquisite shoes.

17:32.210 --> 17:35.960
Imagine, in that way
we're just alike!

17:35.960 --> 17:38.040
Ha ha ha ha!

17:38.040 --> 17:41.210
Now, be a good
little shoe fiend.

17:41.210 --> 17:44.080
I want you to chew your masters
out of farm and home

17:44.080 --> 17:46.420
and into the poor house!

17:48.380 --> 17:52.540
Why, look, your little friends
have come to help.

17:52.540 --> 17:54.960
Fine, fine.

17:54.960 --> 17:57.040
You can all chew
yourselves silly.

17:57.040 --> 18:00.750
As long as all the shoes
are ruined by morning.

18:04.080 --> 18:05.380
We're locked in!

18:05.380 --> 18:08.420
Rolly, what have you
gotten us into
this time?

18:08.420 --> 18:10.040
Who cares?

18:10.040 --> 18:12.880
It's chew time!

18:12.880 --> 18:14.000
Down, boy!

18:14.000 --> 18:16.120
Nobody's chewing
anything.

18:16.120 --> 18:19.420
You heard Cruella,
she wants us to ruin her shoes!

18:19.420 --> 18:21.420
Don't you get it?

18:21.420 --> 18:23.670
It's yet another
subtle variation

18:23.670 --> 18:27.460
on her recurring theme
to steal the farm!

18:27.460 --> 18:29.790
Then can I just chew one?

18:29.790 --> 18:30.960
No!

18:30.960 --> 18:32.080
Once you
start chewing,

18:32.080 --> 18:34.000
you'll never be
able to stop!

18:34.000 --> 18:36.250
You have to be
strong!

18:36.250 --> 18:38.830
But I don't know
if I can be strong.

18:38.830 --> 18:42.170
And I don't know
if I want to.

18:42.170 --> 18:44.080
You can do it,
Rolly.

18:44.080 --> 18:47.120
Your friends are
here to lend you
emotional support.

18:47.120 --> 18:50.380
And to truss you up
like a holiday turkey!

18:50.380 --> 18:52.000
Grab him!

18:52.000 --> 18:53.580
Got you,
leather lover!

18:59.120 --> 19:00.580
He's good.

19:00.580 --> 19:03.960
You gotta admit,
he's good.

19:03.960 --> 19:06.210
Do you not understand?

19:06.210 --> 19:10.120
Nothing is gonna come between me
and them shoes.

19:10.120 --> 19:13.540
I've gotta chew!

19:13.540 --> 19:15.960
Yah! The only question is,

19:15.960 --> 19:20.000
which of you tasty little treats
do I start with?

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
Heh heh heh heh!

19:22.000 --> 19:25.380
Don't do it, Rolly!
Think of your future!

19:27.880 --> 19:30.040
If you keep chewing,
you'll end up on the streets.

19:30.040 --> 19:32.790
You'll be forced to perform
tawdry tricks

19:32.790 --> 19:35.380
to feed your need to gnaw!

19:35.380 --> 19:37.830
♪♪

19:41.080 --> 19:42.620
Cadpig: But, by this time,

19:42.620 --> 19:44.920
the ravages
of compulsive chewing

19:44.920 --> 19:46.710
will have taken
their inevitable toll.

19:48.620 --> 19:49.920
Whew!

19:49.920 --> 19:52.920
That's the most depressing thing
I ever heard.

19:54.000 --> 19:59.040
Yet, nothing cures depression
like a good chew.

20:00.080 --> 20:01.250
Stop!

20:02.790 --> 20:06.040
If you have to chew
something...

20:07.290 --> 20:08.960
chew on me!

20:08.960 --> 20:12.000
Go on!
Chew on me!

20:13.830 --> 20:16.420
I know you guys
are trying to help,

20:16.420 --> 20:19.830
but don't you see,
you can't help me.

20:19.830 --> 20:25.250
I have to have shoes!

20:25.250 --> 20:28.830
One of these, and two of these,
and these and these and these!

20:28.830 --> 20:30.500
And these, these, these!

20:30.500 --> 20:31.960
Ooh, thigh-highs.

20:34.250 --> 20:38.250
I don't care about my home,
I gotta chew!

20:38.250 --> 20:40.790
Then think about
your friends.

20:40.790 --> 20:42.750
I don't care about my friends!

20:42.750 --> 20:47.250
All I care about is rich
Corinthian leather!

20:47.250 --> 20:48.920
Then think about this!

20:48.920 --> 20:49.960
Cruella was right,

20:49.960 --> 20:52.460
you two
are just alike.

20:56.460 --> 20:58.380
She's right, you know.

20:58.380 --> 21:02.040
Selfish, greedy, grasping,
thinking only of yourself.

21:02.040 --> 21:05.290
You and I, we're just alike.

21:05.290 --> 21:08.460
Heh heh heh heh!

21:08.460 --> 21:10.210
No...

21:10.210 --> 21:12.000
No, we're not.

21:17.960 --> 21:19.250
Oh!

21:25.500 --> 21:27.420
What's this?

21:27.420 --> 21:30.500
Those cursed curs have escaped!

21:30.500 --> 21:33.250
They got out through
the skylight.

21:33.250 --> 21:35.830
And look,
nothing's been chewed!

21:35.830 --> 21:38.670
Not so much as a nibble.

21:38.670 --> 21:39.790
Oooh!

21:50.830 --> 21:52.040
Ahhh!

21:54.750 --> 21:56.120
Cruella: Scorch!

21:56.120 --> 21:59.120
What are you looking at?

21:59.120 --> 22:01.330
You wouldn't dare!

22:03.710 --> 22:07.250
Cruella: Oh, no, no!
Not my espadrilles!

22:07.250 --> 22:09.040
No! No! Aaaah!
