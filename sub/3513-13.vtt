00:25.025 --> 00:26.971
Where are the detonators?
Flynn has them.

00:27.027 --> 00:30.008
I don't have them.
They're your responsibility.

00:30.096 --> 00:32.201
I packed them.
Well, I don't see them.

00:32.298 --> 00:35.108
Well, take your head out of
your arse. Wipe your eyes.

00:37.670 --> 00:41.174
How about I blow a hole in your
head and let in some light?

00:45.412 --> 00:47.517
I have an idea.

00:49.916 --> 00:52.556
I kill you both and do this alone.

00:58.458 --> 01:00.096
You looked in the wrong bag.

01:02.095 --> 01:04.268
We have a job to do.

01:40.867 --> 01:42.346
Get me the drill!

02:28.281 --> 02:29.726
Damn! I know this place.

02:29.849 --> 02:31.920
I bought my second engagement
ring from this guy.

02:33.153 --> 02:36.623
Hey. Looks like they came in through the
door just after he closed for the night.

02:36.756 --> 02:39.965
Find a body? Oh, yeah.
Samuel Bertram.

02:40.126 --> 02:42.003
I was afraid of that.
He was in the vault.

02:42.095 --> 02:44.974
Probably thought he was safe.
In the safe.

02:45.064 --> 02:46.338
Surveillance tape?

02:46.399 --> 02:48.140
Thieves found the camera,
ripped it out of the wall.

02:48.201 --> 02:49.976
Probably took it with them.

02:55.775 --> 02:57.448
This was a professional job.

02:58.178 --> 03:00.124
Yeah, they knew what
they were doing.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.319
Sam was a big-time numismatic.

03:02.382 --> 03:03.952
Is that some kind of religion?

03:04.017 --> 03:05.621
In a way, yeah.

03:06.452 --> 03:07.760
Coins.

03:19.599 --> 03:20.634
They are not here.

03:20.700 --> 03:21.974
What are you talking about?
They have to be here.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.742
I don't see them.
We didn't get them.

03:23.803 --> 03:25.805
They were in the vault.
We got everything in the vault.

03:25.872 --> 03:27.647
Then, where the hell are they?

03:30.443 --> 03:33.390
Well, don't look at me.
lam looking at you.

03:35.181 --> 03:37.627
Two years. Six countries.

03:37.684 --> 03:39.061
I worked this.

03:41.154 --> 03:43.998
You were in the back seat.
Oh, you're saying I took them?

03:44.057 --> 03:46.196
I'm saying empty your pockets.

03:46.259 --> 03:48.535
Both of you. Empty yours,
you son of a bitch.

03:48.595 --> 03:49.972
How do we know you
didn't take them?

03:50.029 --> 03:52.976
Shoot me if you're going to shoot me.
There's nothing in my pockets.

04:04.210 --> 04:05.655
Then, they've still
got to be there.

04:05.712 --> 04:07.623
Where are you going?
I'm going back.

04:09.148 --> 04:10.388
What are you doing?
I'm going with him.

04:10.450 --> 04:11.861
You two are not
leaving me here alone.

04:11.918 --> 04:14.728
What if he's got them? How do I know
you two aren't working together?

04:14.787 --> 04:18.291
Because he just left and I'm
standing here with you, you moron.

04:18.891 --> 04:19.995
You really think he has them?

04:20.059 --> 04:21.595
Well, I don't have them.

04:21.694 --> 04:24.106
Well, maybe that's exactly
what you two want me to think.

04:25.398 --> 04:26.399
He's coming back.

06:05.098 --> 06:06.975
Here we go. You got it? Yep.

06:07.033 --> 06:09.741
Which one of these doors has a
surveillance camera covering the street.

06:09.802 --> 06:11.406
There's a bank on the corner.

06:11.471 --> 06:13.144
Start with that,
work your way down.

06:13.206 --> 06:16.449
If we're lucky. You want the
footage of the precinct?

06:16.509 --> 06:17.579
ASAP.

06:50.510 --> 06:53.889
Damn it I saw that car.

06:54.013 --> 06:56.391
What? The guy we passed
on the street tonight,

06:56.482 --> 06:57.927
he was driving that car.

06:58.518 --> 07:01.124
- Can we get the plates?
- Hold up.

07:05.458 --> 07:06.994
Most of it.

07:08.361 --> 07:10.841
New York plates.
Long way from home.

07:11.164 --> 07:12.802
And they're probably bogus,
but run them, anyway.

07:12.865 --> 07:14.310
And put out an APB.

07:15.635 --> 07:17.808
Parker. We get you out
of bed for nothing?

07:17.870 --> 07:19.975
If you did, Nick,
I wouldn't be calling.

07:41.060 --> 07:42.937
Don't you wish you
hadn't come back?

07:44.430 --> 07:46.273
You killed them.

07:48.267 --> 07:50.838
Ironically, they killed each other.

07:51.537 --> 07:53.608
It was dark.

07:55.775 --> 07:57.686
I thought I saw you in Lisbon.

07:57.743 --> 07:58.744
Yeah.

07:59.645 --> 08:01.215
Well, that was my mistake.

08:02.582 --> 08:04.584
The coins aren't here.

08:05.685 --> 08:07.028
I figured that out.

08:07.086 --> 08:08.656
So where are they?

08:09.255 --> 08:11.929
If I knew, you think I
would have come back?

08:11.991 --> 08:12.992
I don't know.

08:13.092 --> 08:16.301
Those coins make people do
a lot of strange things.

08:17.196 --> 08:18.903
Face down on the floor.

08:21.033 --> 08:22.569
Now...

08:24.103 --> 08:26.140
Why don't we start,

08:27.974 --> 08:31.080
with what the hell are
we doing in Portland?

08:32.578 --> 08:35.582
I caught up with
Stanislav in Morocco.

08:37.283 --> 08:39.626
The blast didn't kill him.
Didn't help him much.

08:39.986 --> 08:41.294
But that's not what did him in.

08:41.354 --> 08:45.598
I wasn't sure at first. I was expecting
a pierced lung or a fatal concussion.

08:45.658 --> 08:47.899
But it appears his system
just completely shut down.

08:47.960 --> 08:49.837
Heart attack? Nope.

08:49.929 --> 08:53.103
But I started digging.
Guess what I found in his stomach.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.513
Dinner.

08:55.601 --> 08:57.444
If you like to eat money.

08:57.503 --> 08:59.983
I prefer to spend it.

09:00.072 --> 09:02.416
I guess he was really
trying to take it with him.

09:03.676 --> 09:05.519
The flip side is
kind of interesting.

09:06.712 --> 09:08.658
- It's got to be German.
- Mmm-hmm.

09:08.781 --> 09:10.158
Yeah, it looks older than that.

09:10.216 --> 09:11.559
Must be valuable if
he swallowed them.

09:13.052 --> 09:14.326
Is that what killed him?

09:14.387 --> 09:16.890
His brain, stomach,
and intestines were all inflamed.

09:17.390 --> 09:20.132
But gold doesn't usually get
that kind of allergic reaction.

09:20.693 --> 09:22.570
Could it have been a drug reaction?

09:22.628 --> 09:24.039
Tox isn't back, yet.

09:25.731 --> 09:26.937
Hey, what are you doing?

09:26.999 --> 09:28.103
Taking them.

09:28.167 --> 09:31.171
But I think I should hold onto those
until the toxicology report comes back.

09:31.237 --> 09:32.477
But they're still evidence.

09:32.538 --> 09:34.745
Could be why they blew the vault.

09:34.807 --> 09:39.278
Burkhardt. Where? Okay.

09:39.845 --> 09:41.552
They found the BMW.

09:41.614 --> 09:44.151
But guys... Guys?

09:58.397 --> 09:59.740
What have we got? Where is it?

09:59.799 --> 10:01.676
BMW is in front.
Only house on the block.

10:01.734 --> 10:03.008
All right. Anybody go in or out?

10:03.102 --> 10:05.173
No. All right. Come on.
Let's get this done.

10:06.572 --> 10:08.415
All right. You cover the back.

10:11.844 --> 10:13.585
Hey. You okay?

10:13.679 --> 10:14.885
Never better.

10:16.115 --> 10:20.154
Soledad, if the jeweler's got the coins,
then where are they?

10:20.453 --> 10:22.933
If I knew that, I wouldn't be here.

10:22.989 --> 10:24.900
That's why I went back.

10:25.024 --> 10:27.436
But the cops were
all over the place.

10:32.832 --> 10:34.505
Police.

10:36.669 --> 10:38.342
Stop! Police!

10:44.543 --> 10:45.886
Hey! Don't you move.

10:48.781 --> 10:49.782
Hank, come on!

10:49.882 --> 10:50.952
He's got a gun!

10:53.953 --> 10:55.193
Hank! Easy, he's down!

10:55.254 --> 10:56.255
Stay down!

10:58.724 --> 11:00.203
All right, hands above
your head. Come on.

11:14.106 --> 11:15.210
There was another one.

11:15.274 --> 11:16.275
What happened?

11:16.342 --> 11:18.344
He was fast. I've never
seen anyone run like that.

11:18.411 --> 11:20.152
Oh, you lost him.
Don't make excuses.

11:20.279 --> 11:21.815
Hank. Do I have to
do everything myself?

11:21.881 --> 11:22.882
Listen, Hank!

11:23.783 --> 11:26.627
We've got a crime scene here.
He's gone, let him go.

11:27.119 --> 11:29.599
All right. Officer Brenner?
Get a coroner up here.

11:30.556 --> 11:33.696
On your feet. Let's go.

11:45.638 --> 11:47.311
Dispatch, we need a,
uh, coroner at...

11:54.080 --> 11:55.525
Rest in peace, Kolt.

11:57.349 --> 11:58.828
All right. Let's get
these coins in evidence.

11:58.884 --> 12:00.192
Hey, don't worry. I got it.

12:00.252 --> 12:02.095
But first I'm gonna break that guy.

12:02.254 --> 12:03.995
I just got the prelim
on the jewelry store.

12:04.056 --> 12:05.763
I want you guys to fill
me in in my office.

12:15.701 --> 12:17.146
That's when we got
the call on the car.

12:17.236 --> 12:20.479
We ran it down and came on the
house they were using as a hideout.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.151
Look, Captain,
there were these coins...

12:22.208 --> 12:23.619
I got it! I got it!

12:23.843 --> 12:26.380
So, we got to the house.
We went right in and I took him down.

12:26.445 --> 12:27.685
Two bodies on the floor.
One guy got...

12:27.747 --> 12:30.057
Hey, hey, hey. Slow down.
I want to hear more about these coins.

12:30.149 --> 12:32.561
I got 'em. I'm gonna
put them in evidence.

12:33.252 --> 12:35.095
Well, can I see them?
Why? They're safe.

12:35.154 --> 12:37.134
Parker pulled them from
the jewelers' stomach.

12:37.323 --> 12:38.768
Uh, apparently he swallowed them.

12:38.824 --> 12:41.430
The coins are not the problem here.
It's about that guy we took down.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.638
Just give me five minutes
with him... Hank!

12:49.235 --> 12:50.680
I wanna see the coins.

13:08.821 --> 13:09.993
They're, uh...

13:11.690 --> 13:12.691
German.

13:13.192 --> 13:14.432
Not necessarily.

13:15.761 --> 13:18.401
The swastika dates all the
way back to antiquity.

13:18.764 --> 13:22.211
In Buddhism and Hinduism,
it's primarily a symbol of good luck.

13:22.301 --> 13:25.111
And for the Chinese,
this represents eternity.

13:26.939 --> 13:28.384
What do you know about the coins?

13:28.440 --> 13:30.613
Just that the jeweler was trying
to hide them in his stomach.

13:32.411 --> 13:33.412
I'll take them into evidence.

13:33.479 --> 13:35.652
That's all right, I'll get 'em there.
Captain, I think I should...

13:35.714 --> 13:37.159
Detective. Now,
I understand that you came on

13:37.216 --> 13:38.627
a little strong tonight
with our suspect.

13:39.351 --> 13:42.889
We've all had a long day. I suggest you
go home and get yourself a little rest.

13:43.689 --> 13:44.997
Nick will interview the suspect.

13:45.057 --> 13:47.560
Yes, sir. Hank. Let's go.

13:53.232 --> 13:54.711
What the hell is wrong
with the Captain?

13:54.767 --> 13:56.542
I'm the one who should be putting
those coins into evidence.

13:56.635 --> 13:58.672
I'm the primary on this.
Hank, look.

13:58.737 --> 14:01.581
We've all had a long day here.
Why don't you just go home?

14:04.844 --> 14:05.845
Hank.

14:10.950 --> 14:11.951
Go.

14:12.885 --> 14:14.228
Yeah.

14:15.654 --> 14:17.258
Yeah, okay.

14:35.741 --> 14:36.742
Oui?

15:00.666 --> 15:01.667
Farley Kolt.

15:06.438 --> 15:09.112
Imagine my surprise l
thought you were just a cop.

15:10.509 --> 15:12.079
Right now, that's all
you need to worry about.

15:12.144 --> 15:16.650
I'm not worried. Ballistics will prove
that Flynn and Hans shot each other.

15:16.715 --> 15:17.887
Flynn and Hans?

15:17.950 --> 15:21.056
Ian Flynn. Irish by way of Berlin.

15:22.121 --> 15:23.862
Hans Roth. Austrian.

15:23.923 --> 15:26.927
They both worked with a Spaniard,
Soledad Marquesa.

15:26.992 --> 15:28.596
Who got away. Yep.

15:29.328 --> 15:32.172
I've been following them for a long time.
I finally caught up with them tonight.

15:32.231 --> 15:33.642
But uh...

15:34.533 --> 15:36.137
And why were you following them?

15:39.004 --> 15:42.850
It would be helpful if we could talk
off the record. Is this being recorded?

15:42.908 --> 15:45.718
No. I want to give you
a chance to come clean.

15:47.513 --> 15:50.050
Look, this has nothing to do
with you being a cop, you know.

15:50.115 --> 15:52.152
Really, I could care less.

15:52.217 --> 15:54.857
This has to do with who
you are and who I am.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.526
You're not the only Grimm
I've ever known. In fact,

15:59.124 --> 16:01.297
the reason I'm here
is because of a Grimm.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.805
Tell me about the coins.

16:05.364 --> 16:06.934
Well, they're priceless.

16:07.032 --> 16:10.411
A lot of people have died trying
to get their hands on them.

16:10.469 --> 16:11.743
Where did they come from?

16:11.804 --> 16:15.308
That, my friend,
is a long, long story.

16:15.407 --> 16:16.750
Tell me.

16:18.243 --> 16:20.052
Okay.

16:20.846 --> 16:23.019
Eighth Century BC,
gold was being mined

16:23.082 --> 16:25.619
on the island of Zacynthus
in ancient Greece.

16:25.684 --> 16:28.563
Now, certain coins that
were struck from that mine

16:28.620 --> 16:31.294
were stamped with a
swastika on one side,

16:31.357 --> 16:33.803
signifying good fortune,
and a lion's head on the other

16:33.959 --> 16:37.031
symbolizing wealth and power.
Now, this particular lion's head

16:37.096 --> 16:40.270
was the Nemean lion
slayed by Heracles,

16:40.332 --> 16:43.643
whose fur was impervious to attacks
because it was made of gold.

16:43.702 --> 16:47.172
And whose claws were
sharper than mortal swords

16:47.239 --> 16:49.776
and could cut through armor.

16:49.942 --> 16:54.152
And it would seem those who held
the coins possessed a kind of

16:54.213 --> 16:56.750
charismatic influence
over other men.

16:57.249 --> 17:00.389
As the Greek empire fell,

17:00.452 --> 17:02.728
the coins found their way
into the Romans' hands.

17:03.455 --> 17:06.367
From Claudius to Caligula to Nero.

17:06.791 --> 17:10.762
The coins had a devastating
effect on whoever possessed them.

17:11.063 --> 17:14.567
From there, the coins made their
way into China and the Han dynasty.

17:14.633 --> 17:17.204
Then, they just disappeared
for several centuries.

17:17.336 --> 17:20.714
Until they resurfaced
in the Third Reich.

17:20.839 --> 17:23.911
We all know how that story goes.

17:24.009 --> 17:27.512
And so, after the defeat of the Nazis,
the coins disappeared again.

17:28.914 --> 17:32.726
Nobody but a small handful of
people knew where the coins were.

17:33.185 --> 17:36.689
Those people were your ancestors.

17:36.889 --> 17:40.393
Grimms are stronger than most.
Not so easily affected.

17:40.859 --> 17:44.739
And they have taken great
care to protect the coins.

17:44.797 --> 17:48.301
And they've been successful at
it until eighteen years ago.

17:48.400 --> 17:51.540
When the Grimm who was protecting
the coins was found and murdered.

17:52.538 --> 17:55.576
Once again, the coins
were in circulation.

17:56.075 --> 17:58.612
Who was the Grimm who was killed?

17:58.677 --> 18:02.181
She was the sister of the
woman I was in love with.

18:03.115 --> 18:08.963
When her sister died, she left me
in order to raise her sister's son.

18:13.158 --> 18:15.798
Where was this? Rhinebeck,
New York.

18:16.462 --> 18:18.908
Don't keep me locked up here.

18:18.964 --> 18:20.910
I can see things you can't.

18:25.804 --> 18:27.010
Impressive.

18:28.140 --> 18:29.915
That's not enough
to get you released.

18:32.678 --> 18:34.817
You need my help to
find those coins.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.157
Because once those coins
get a hold of you,

18:37.249 --> 18:39.456
you will fight to the
death to keep them.

18:50.529 --> 18:53.032
Officer Brenner never reported
back from the crime scene.

18:53.098 --> 18:55.078
And he's not responding to calls.

18:55.167 --> 18:57.238
- You tell the Captain?
- Yeah, I just did.

18:58.337 --> 19:00.408
Where is he?
On his way to Evidence.

19:04.676 --> 19:07.247
I've got a positive ID on
the suspect who got away.

19:07.312 --> 19:10.623
Soledad Marquesa,
he's a Spanish national.

19:10.682 --> 19:11.922
I'll run it.

20:18.283 --> 20:19.284
Oh, jeez.

20:25.624 --> 20:29.128
Oh, my God. Oh, you scared me.

20:30.262 --> 20:31.263
Good.

21:00.092 --> 21:01.765
This is way past my bedtime.
You know?

21:02.127 --> 21:04.664
Well, if I could speak German,
I wouldn't have called.

21:05.330 --> 21:06.570
Oh.

21:06.632 --> 21:07.804
So we've got a little...

21:08.967 --> 21:09.968
...do we?

21:10.035 --> 21:11.343
I think the answer to that is, yes.

21:12.471 --> 21:13.779
Really? Go for it.

21:14.906 --> 21:15.907
Wow.

21:17.376 --> 21:18.980
Okay.

21:19.044 --> 21:21.650
Let's see what we've got here.

21:23.815 --> 21:26.694
A Steinadler and Schakal.

21:28.720 --> 21:31.257
Oh, this is high German.

21:31.490 --> 21:35.529
This is the stuff my grandfather used
to speak after a couple of beers.

21:46.038 --> 21:49.508
"On our way from Munich to Augsburg,
I came across a small

21:49.574 --> 21:51.918
"fire a little ways
into the woods."

21:55.580 --> 22:00.051
Ooh. This is some pretty
bad Schakal this, uh,

22:00.118 --> 22:02.621
relative of yours is writing about.

22:04.189 --> 22:07.102
Whoa, look out. They ate a baby.

22:08.093 --> 22:11.074
That's rude. Okay, okay.
Here we go.

22:11.129 --> 22:16.010
So, he caught up with the Schakal and,
of course, cut off his head.

22:21.807 --> 22:23.343
You guys are really into that,
aren't you?

22:23.408 --> 22:26.912
Okay. ls there any indication what
I'm up against with these Schakals?

22:27.045 --> 22:29.047
Well, yeah. They're
baby-eating bad-asses, man.

22:29.114 --> 22:30.559
What more do you need to know?

22:30.949 --> 22:34.328
So, what about the,
um... Steinadlers?

22:34.419 --> 22:38.595
Steinadler. Let's see. Huh.

22:40.025 --> 22:42.096
What? Just a second.
This is interesting.

22:42.160 --> 22:45.334
Steinadlers seem to be
involved with the military.

22:45.931 --> 22:48.002
Like, heroic, noble.

22:48.066 --> 22:50.012
Apparently, with very large...

22:51.570 --> 22:52.571
Sausages.

22:53.705 --> 22:55.776
I don't think I'm
translating that correctly.

22:55.874 --> 22:59.378
Um... But, anyway, when you're
dealing with the Steinadler,

22:59.444 --> 23:02.914
it's, um... Basically, what they're saying
is it's hard to tell whose side he's on.

23:02.981 --> 23:04.483
So, they can't be trusted.

23:04.549 --> 23:08.053
No, it's not that exactly.
It's more like a, um...

23:08.687 --> 23:10.325
Like "trust your gut."

23:10.722 --> 23:14.431
But the thing that really doesn't add
up is the Steinadler with a Schakal.

23:14.926 --> 23:16.769
They're like opposite
sides of a coin.

23:19.364 --> 23:21.674
Well, it's funny you
should mention that.

23:22.868 --> 23:25.576
There was a jewelry store robbery
involving some rare coins.

23:26.371 --> 23:30.319
Uh, with a swastika on one side,
lion's head on the other.

23:30.375 --> 23:32.355
You know anything about that? No.

23:32.411 --> 23:33.617
You got me on that one.

23:33.678 --> 23:37.182
Coins? Not my thing. Now, stamps,
on the other hand, I'm a whiz.

23:37.949 --> 23:39.587
Well... Dealing with coins here.

23:39.651 --> 23:41.460
Well, I've got nothing.

23:42.754 --> 23:45.496
Anything else you want me
to translate? No. Thank you.

23:47.259 --> 23:49.705
Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Careful now! Sorry.

23:51.897 --> 23:54.901
Oh, my God.
Is that camera an Akeley?

23:55.100 --> 23:56.773
Be careful.

23:56.968 --> 23:58.470
Where did you get this?

23:58.970 --> 24:00.779
Oh, right. Aunt Marie. Of course.

24:02.774 --> 24:08.156
No way. Dude. That is
a Kineclair projector.

24:09.114 --> 24:10.821
How do you know all of this?

24:11.049 --> 24:14.792
Okay. My great uncle on
my mother's side, Olaf.

24:14.853 --> 24:16.560
That's my uncle's name,
not my mother's.

24:16.621 --> 24:20.694
He worked as a newsreel
cameraman in Berlin in the 20s.

24:20.859 --> 24:23.066
He had a camera shop
on the Leitung Strasse.

24:23.161 --> 24:26.665
So, when he died, my mother got
all of his old stuff. And...

24:27.866 --> 24:30.472
Right. I'm sorry. It's late.

24:30.802 --> 24:32.042
I should be going.

24:33.705 --> 24:36.117
Look, I appreciate all of your help.
Yeah, yeah. No problem.

24:36.174 --> 24:38.950
It's just, you've got me thinking I've
got to find those old cameras, man.

24:39.010 --> 24:40.990
I'm going to be up all night
rummaging through the attic.

24:41.847 --> 24:43.849
All right. Bis spaeter, alligator.

24:43.949 --> 24:45.257
Bis spaeter.

24:50.422 --> 24:51.924
We arrested a guy tonight.

24:52.023 --> 24:54.629
During the interview,
he said something pretty weird.

24:54.726 --> 24:56.171
What did he say?

25:01.933 --> 25:04.209
He said he knew someone
from Rhinebeck.

25:04.336 --> 25:06.282
Rhinebeck, New York,
where you were born?

25:06.338 --> 25:07.339
Yeah.

25:08.373 --> 25:10.683
He said he was with a
woman eighteen years ago.

25:11.676 --> 25:14.179
But, she left him when her
sister died in an accident.

25:15.680 --> 25:19.355
And she left him to take
care of her sister's kid.

25:20.151 --> 25:22.631
Wait a minute. Was he talking
about your Aunt Marie?

25:24.422 --> 25:26.333
I don't know. You didn't ask?

25:26.558 --> 25:28.936
Look. I couldn't.

25:29.794 --> 25:33.037
That's a police investigation.
I can't bring my personal life into it.

25:33.632 --> 25:36.112
Yeah, he could use it against me.

25:36.234 --> 25:37.770
And... I don't even know if
he's telling me the truth.

25:37.836 --> 25:39.042
Well, how do you find out?

25:39.104 --> 25:40.606
I have to do some digging.

25:41.740 --> 25:44.914
Okay. How can I help?

25:45.710 --> 25:47.587
Listen, his name is Farley Kolt.

25:48.613 --> 25:51.787
I want to know if he was living
in Rhinebeck when he said he was.

26:13.772 --> 26:15.376
Why did you cut him open?

26:15.440 --> 26:16.976
To determine the cause of death.

26:18.276 --> 26:19.619
What did you find out?

26:21.680 --> 26:23.318
Only tell me if you want to live.

26:24.182 --> 26:25.684
He was poisoned.

26:26.685 --> 26:28.596
The coins.

26:28.653 --> 26:30.894
You found the coins.
Where are they?

26:30.956 --> 26:32.367
I... The police took them.

26:33.158 --> 26:34.933
When? A few hours ago.

26:37.896 --> 26:39.204
What are you going to do?

27:45.630 --> 27:49.009
I swear I don't know
what happened. I promise.

27:49.067 --> 27:50.910
Hey.

27:51.002 --> 27:53.482
How are you feeling? Guilty.

27:53.538 --> 27:55.142
I don't know what came
over me last night.

27:55.206 --> 27:57.482
I go to the edge sometimes
but I almost never go over.

27:58.176 --> 27:59.177
Happens.

28:01.446 --> 28:02.720
What have we got?

28:02.781 --> 28:04.988
We've got an ID on the other
set of prints from the house.

28:06.484 --> 28:07.792
Soledad Marquesa.

28:07.852 --> 28:09.388
The guy who got away last night?

28:09.454 --> 28:10.956
Yeah. Pretty lengthy
criminal career in Europe.

28:11.022 --> 28:13.696
Known to associate with our two
dead thieves, Flynn and Hans.

28:13.758 --> 28:14.759
What about Kolt?

28:14.859 --> 28:16.270
Well, ballistics cleared
him on the shooting.

28:16.327 --> 28:18.739
But we still don't know if
he was involved in the heist.

28:18.897 --> 28:20.376
I wanna take a closer
look at this guy.

28:22.100 --> 28:24.842
He did have this in his possession.

28:25.737 --> 28:28.775
Hotel Deluxe.
Checked in two nights ago.

28:29.641 --> 28:31.416
What are we doing here?
Let's get a warrant.

28:47.459 --> 28:48.460
Yes, sir?

28:48.860 --> 28:51.340
I want you to call a press
conference for two o'clock today.

28:51.396 --> 28:52.397
Today, sir?

28:52.464 --> 28:55.968
Here at the precinct. All officers
and personnel are required to attend.

28:56.034 --> 28:58.605
Yes, sir. Can I say
what it's about?

28:58.670 --> 29:00.911
The present state of law
enforcement in our city.

29:28.366 --> 29:30.073
Thanks. If we need anything
else we'll let you know.

29:30.135 --> 29:31.136
Okay.

29:44.382 --> 29:47.488
I've got a suitcase.
You find anything?

29:47.552 --> 29:52.058
A couple of Armani suits, two pair of
Mephisto shoes, and a pair of commando
boots.

29:52.657 --> 29:54.659
You know, I found some black
clothing in the dresser.

29:54.826 --> 29:56.169
You thinking black ops?

29:56.227 --> 29:57.228
I don't know.

29:57.295 --> 29:59.366
He was pretty cool under
the interrogation.

30:02.801 --> 30:04.644
Who wants to bet he's moving drugs?

30:06.237 --> 30:07.944
Huh. What do you know.

30:08.039 --> 30:09.950
There's actually film in there.

30:13.478 --> 30:14.479
Hmm.

30:16.314 --> 30:18.988
1943. This letter is in German.

30:19.050 --> 30:21.087
Any idea what streng geheim means?

30:21.152 --> 30:23.723
I imagine "top secret,
" like this one in English.

30:23.788 --> 30:27.793
Dated June 1945.088.

30:28.059 --> 30:31.563
Office of Strategic Services.
That's a precursor to the CIA.

30:31.996 --> 30:34.067
I knew there was something
freaky about this guy.

30:36.034 --> 30:38.844
Who signed that? W. Donavan

30:40.939 --> 30:43.351
"This letter will serve
as background information

30:43.408 --> 30:45.410
"relevant to the discovery
of the Imperial coins by the

30:45.476 --> 30:48.946
"101st airborn at the
Kehlstein Haus, April 1945.

30:49.013 --> 30:51.357
"Ten coins were thought to exist.

30:51.416 --> 30:54.329
"Three in a lead-lined
box were discovered here.

30:54.419 --> 30:57.923
"They're being relocated to Allied
Headquarters under guard to be placed in a
vault.

30:58.289 --> 31:00.633
"Emission spectrochemical
analysis has revealed

31:00.725 --> 31:03.331
"that the coins contain gold,
arsenic, and mercury.

31:03.428 --> 31:08.502
"Because of their toxicity, under no
circumstances are the coins to be handled."

31:10.068 --> 31:11.274
Now they tell me.

31:13.371 --> 31:16.875
You really think those coins could
actually physically affect somebody?

31:17.242 --> 31:19.449
Well, you were pretty
edgy last night.

31:19.577 --> 31:22.251
Well, it was weird. I was pumped.

31:22.313 --> 31:25.157
Possessed. I was like a...
Like a man on fire.

31:25.717 --> 31:27.458
And the Captain took the coins.

31:29.053 --> 31:32.557
He said he was going to take
them to evidence. I hope he did.

31:34.792 --> 31:38.296
Griffin. What?

31:39.030 --> 31:40.031
When did that happen?

31:40.798 --> 31:42.573
Yeah. Okay.

31:43.835 --> 31:45.508
Parker was put in the hospital.

31:45.603 --> 31:47.446
She was pistol whipped last night.

31:47.505 --> 31:50.111
Apparently, whoever did it was
interested in our dead jeweler.

31:50.642 --> 31:52.383
Soledad Marquesa.

31:52.443 --> 31:54.081
He's going after the coins.

31:54.178 --> 31:56.215
All right, you want to finish up here?
I'll see about Parker.

31:56.281 --> 31:59.228
Yeah. I'll get the docs translated
and look after the coins.

32:31.149 --> 32:33.823
Sorry, Burkhardt.
Got to lock up and kick you out.

32:33.885 --> 32:35.159
Why?

32:35.219 --> 32:37.130
Captain's giving
some kind of speech.

32:37.188 --> 32:38.895
We all got to be there.

32:38.957 --> 32:40.265
Did you find what you
were looking for?

32:40.625 --> 32:42.605
No.

32:42.694 --> 32:45.573
Hey, are you sure the Captain didn't
bring anything into Evidence last night?

32:45.630 --> 32:47.200
If he did, it's not in the log.

32:47.265 --> 32:49.108
Come on. We gotta go.

33:03.214 --> 33:06.991
The war against crime and criminal
behavior cannot be waged...

33:07.118 --> 33:09.029
What's going on? I have no idea.

33:09.120 --> 33:12.624
...the elements of our society
which allow that enemy to exist.

33:13.624 --> 33:18.369
We are confronted with an epidemic
of moral degradation. And we must

33:18.429 --> 33:21.899
fight with the greatest vigor
against all those influences

33:21.966 --> 33:25.778
which are trying to weaken the
very fabric of our society.

33:25.837 --> 33:28.374
We stand here...
You find the coins?

33:29.674 --> 33:31.278
They were never
recorded as evidence.

33:31.342 --> 33:33.913
...how big or small. Our dedication

33:33.978 --> 33:36.356
to this task knows no boundaries.
With the brutal

33:36.414 --> 33:39.020
death two nights
ago of Sam Bertram,

33:39.150 --> 33:42.131
a successful jeweler and
business owner here in our city

33:42.186 --> 33:43.460
for over thirty-five years,

33:45.056 --> 33:47.832
that line has been crossed.

33:47.892 --> 33:50.998
And I, for one, will not rest

33:51.229 --> 33:55.974
until we bring justice to every
last citizen who has ever had

33:56.100 --> 33:59.240
the misfortune of being
terrorized in their streets

33:59.404 --> 34:01.714
and in their businesses
and in their homes.

34:01.773 --> 34:04.583
It ends here, and it ends now.

34:04.642 --> 34:06.212
Thank you. Thank you.

34:11.783 --> 34:12.784
Thank you.

34:23.928 --> 34:26.772
Captain Renard, is this speech
intended to launch a political career?

34:26.831 --> 34:30.074
Well, it's intended to be a warning to
anyone who plans on breaking the law in our
city.

34:30.134 --> 34:31.772
Sir, the coins.

34:31.835 --> 34:33.179
They're not in the evidence room.

34:33.237 --> 34:34.409
I'm busy.

34:34.739 --> 34:35.739
Captain...

34:36.507 --> 34:38.509
He's lying. He's got them.

34:38.909 --> 34:39.911
We have to get them back.

34:44.081 --> 34:45.083
Hey.

34:45.183 --> 34:47.060
So, I found out some interesting
stuff about Farley Kolt.

34:47.118 --> 34:48.119
Yo u ready?

34:48.186 --> 34:49.187
Yeah.

34:49.253 --> 34:51.529
According to real estate
records and phone books,

34:51.621 --> 34:53.067
he spent five years in Rhinebeck.

34:53.891 --> 34:57.065
The same exact time you were there
and seems to have left around 1994.

34:57.161 --> 34:58.435
Same year my parents died.

34:58.563 --> 34:59.564
Exactly.

34:59.864 --> 35:01.537
You want me to get more? Yeah.

35:01.599 --> 35:03.340
Thanks, Juliette. You're the best.

35:03.401 --> 35:04.402
I know.

35:07.371 --> 35:09.112
Hey, what's that about
your parents dying?

35:09.240 --> 35:10.241
I don't know yet.

35:11.576 --> 35:14.079
Hey, keep an eye on the Captain.
I'm going to go talk to Kolt.

35:16.814 --> 35:17.815
Got it.

35:30.628 --> 35:32.835
What was the name of the woman
you knew in Rhinebeck, New York?

35:34.432 --> 35:35.968
So, you checked my story. Good.

35:36.033 --> 35:37.103
What was her name?

35:38.669 --> 35:40.410
Marie Kessler. Why?

35:44.542 --> 35:45.543
How well did you know her?

35:46.410 --> 35:47.684
We were engaged.

35:48.045 --> 35:50.218
I can't say either side of
the family was too happy.

35:53.284 --> 35:54.285
You know her.

35:58.422 --> 35:59.833
She was my aunt.

36:00.358 --> 36:02.531
You're the kid she had to raise.
I didn't know.

36:05.029 --> 36:06.667
Then, she's dead, isn't she?

36:09.133 --> 36:10.134
How long ago?

36:11.469 --> 36:12.539
Four months.

36:15.540 --> 36:16.541
I'm sorry.

36:18.643 --> 36:20.816
I wish I could have seen
her just one more time.

36:20.878 --> 36:22.858
Yeah, well, me too.

36:25.449 --> 36:27.395
Still trying to figure
out if you can trust me?

36:27.919 --> 36:29.227
Yeah, something like that.

36:29.287 --> 36:30.288
Look, I can help you.

36:30.388 --> 36:33.198
Soledad will make his
move if he hasn't already.

36:34.358 --> 36:35.837
He got the coins at one time.

36:36.260 --> 36:38.501
Eighteen years ago,
outside Rhinebeck,

36:38.596 --> 36:40.041
Highway Nine G.

36:45.069 --> 36:46.742
Soledad killed my parents?

36:48.573 --> 36:49.984
He was one of the many involved.

36:51.676 --> 36:54.623
My point is, he got the coins.

36:55.646 --> 36:58.183
Or should I say, the coins got him.

37:04.188 --> 37:06.691
Yeah. They found Officer
Brenner's body in a motel room.

37:06.757 --> 37:08.236
Somebody stripped his uniform.

37:08.292 --> 37:10.704
Well, that's something that I
can't answer at this point.

37:10.761 --> 37:12.741
But, uh... The Captain's leaving.
You better get up here.

37:19.937 --> 37:22.440
Soledad killed a police
officer and took his uniform.

37:22.506 --> 37:24.713
And he's here? Get me out.

37:39.090 --> 37:41.468
And we will make changes,
and they will have an effect.

37:41.959 --> 37:44.064
Thank you. That's it for today.
I've got a meeting with the mayor.

37:44.161 --> 37:45.731
Thanks, sir. Thank you.

38:11.789 --> 38:12.790
You won't find the coins here.

38:13.391 --> 38:14.392
Where's the Captain?

38:14.492 --> 38:15.493
He just left.

38:16.427 --> 38:17.428
What's he doing here?

38:17.495 --> 38:21.136
Ballistics cleared him. He knows Soledad
and he can help us find him. Let's go.

38:56.200 --> 38:57.201
He's here.

39:00.604 --> 39:01.605
Stay here.

39:11.749 --> 39:12.750
Captain!

39:15.319 --> 39:16.627
Police! Put down your gun!

39:34.705 --> 39:35.706
Stay down! Stay down!

39:36.907 --> 39:37.908
You all right?

39:38.075 --> 39:39.076
Are you hit?

39:50.554 --> 39:51.555
Listen to me.

39:51.622 --> 39:55.035
Two people were killed in Rhinebeck,
New York, 18 years ago.

39:55.192 --> 39:57.934
Reed and Kelly Burkhardt.
You were involved.

39:58.028 --> 39:59.029
Please.

39:59.130 --> 40:00.131
Tell me what happened.

40:00.297 --> 40:03.801
Please. Let me hold the
coins one more time.

40:04.268 --> 40:05.338
Tell me!

40:08.072 --> 40:09.073
Tell me.

40:18.082 --> 40:19.561
I'll go check on the Captain.

40:20.451 --> 40:23.591
No, no, no. I can't. No.
You have to help me find them,

40:23.654 --> 40:26.760
I can't find them. Nick,
who took them? Who took them, Nick?

40:53.150 --> 40:54.959
I was hoping you'd come
back for the briefcase.

40:57.154 --> 40:58.326
Put the coins on the bed.

40:58.456 --> 41:00.265
Okay. Hold on a second. Look.
You don't understand.

41:00.324 --> 41:02.099
I do understand.
Put the coins on the bed.

41:10.134 --> 41:11.169
No.

41:19.510 --> 41:20.648
You'll never find them again.

41:21.879 --> 41:23.256
Forget about 'em.

41:23.581 --> 41:24.582
Oh, I've tried.

41:26.350 --> 41:27.351
Try harder.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
