Passport, please.

00:23.829 --> 00:25.195
Good evening.

00:26.999 --> 00:29.833
Mr. Sirakov.

00:29.835 --> 00:31.167
Am I saying that right?

00:31.169 --> 00:33.169
Yeah.

00:33.171 --> 00:35.839
Bulgaria. You're a long way from home.

00:35.841 --> 00:37.707
Reason for visiting the United States?

00:37.709 --> 00:38.975
I'm here on vacation.

00:40.579 --> 00:42.078
May I ask why you're traveling so late?

00:42.080 --> 00:43.880
I wanted to avoid traffic.

00:43.882 --> 00:45.882
It's very quiet. It's good.

00:50.255 --> 00:52.355
Mr. Sirakov, I need you
to step out of the vehicle.

00:52.357 --> 00:54.557
Please turn off the ignition
and leave the keys in the car.

01:08.073 --> 01:09.761
Come with me, please.

01:10.359 --> 01:11.508
I didn't do anything wrong.

01:11.510 --> 01:12.676
Come with me.

01:20.152 --> 01:22.085
Hold here, please.

01:30.862 --> 01:32.195
Follow me.

01:39.127 --> 01:40.337
Arms up.

03:09.528 --> 03:12.545
Erica J. Shepherd,
to betray one's country

03:12.547 --> 03:14.831
is a particularly heinous act.

03:14.833 --> 03:17.834
To do so at the cost of
human life is unthinkable.

03:17.836 --> 03:20.303
Brian Lanich, Steven Haibach,

03:20.305 --> 03:23.206
Desiree Villareal, Laine Heffron.

03:23.208 --> 03:26.042
I fear no punishment,
no matter how severe,

03:26.044 --> 03:28.928
can ever assuage the pain
and sorrow endured

03:28.930 --> 03:31.047
by the families
and the loved ones of the dead.

03:31.049 --> 03:33.016
A country mourns their loss.

03:33.018 --> 03:35.885
It is the judgment of
this court that the defendant,

03:35.887 --> 03:39.489
Erica J. Shepherd, shall be and is hereby

03:39.491 --> 03:43.126
remanded to the ADX Florence
Federal Penitentiary

03:43.128 --> 03:46.362
where you will serve
15 consecutive sentences

03:46.364 --> 03:51.034
of life imprisonment without
the possibility of parole.

03:51.036 --> 03:54.137
May God have mercy on your soul.

04:46.958 --> 04:49.092
Her name is Aylin Demir.

04:49.094 --> 04:50.693
She's responsible for the bombing

04:50.695 --> 04:52.729
at Incirlik Air Base
in Turkey four years ago.

04:52.731 --> 04:54.898
I remember reading about her.
She died in prison, didn't she?

04:54.900 --> 04:56.366
Yes.

04:56.368 --> 04:57.934
29 American airmen died in that attack.

04:57.936 --> 04:59.736
Turned out to be an inside job.

04:59.738 --> 05:02.839
Demir was an American working
as a civilian contractor.

05:02.841 --> 05:05.174
She stole a classified
vulnerability report

05:05.176 --> 05:06.643
that was used by rebels
to plan the attack.

05:06.645 --> 05:08.678
She took full responsibility for the act.

05:08.680 --> 05:10.313
Never named her co-conspirator.

05:10.315 --> 05:11.981
No, but over the course
of that first year,

05:11.983 --> 05:13.149
I was able to cultivate her as an asset.

05:13.151 --> 05:14.384
You got her to trust you?

05:14.386 --> 05:15.919
Well, we had something in common.

05:15.921 --> 05:17.470
- What?
- We both betrayed our country.

05:17.472 --> 05:20.073
Over time she gave up the name
of a co-conspirator

05:20.075 --> 05:22.358
in the base bombing... Serhan Aksoy.

05:22.360 --> 05:24.460
He's a Turkish resistance
fighter affiliated

05:24.462 --> 05:26.129
with the anti-American HKP.

05:26.131 --> 05:27.263
Shepherd told me about him

05:27.265 --> 05:28.898
when she was released from ADMAX.

05:28.900 --> 05:32.001
So as a precaution I placed
Aksoy on our watch list.

05:32.003 --> 05:33.836
Hours ago, we got a hit.

05:33.838 --> 05:35.438
Aksoy entered the United States

05:35.440 --> 05:37.006
using a fake Bulgarian passport,

05:37.008 --> 05:38.808
but not before attacking three
customs officers

05:38.810 --> 05:40.443
during a routine search.

05:40.445 --> 05:42.979
Aksoy is a merciless,
deliberate assassin.

05:42.981 --> 05:46.549
He is not only experienced
in exotic poisons

05:46.551 --> 05:49.886
and bomb building,
but his hands are soaked

05:49.888 --> 05:51.654
in the blood of innocent Americans.

05:51.656 --> 05:54.340
He's here, he's on our soil,
and he's planning an attack.

05:54.342 --> 05:56.492
We need to find him and stop him.

06:06.338 --> 06:09.138
Deputy Director Molinero.
What can I do for you?

06:09.140 --> 06:12.008
I understand your team
is hunting a foreign operative,

06:12.010 --> 06:13.142
Serhan Aksoy.

06:13.144 --> 06:14.811
Word travels fast.

06:14.813 --> 06:17.046
- I'm concerned, Agent Keaton.
- About what?

06:17.048 --> 06:18.715
Erica Shepherd's been
cooperating with you

06:18.717 --> 06:20.516
on the Tal investigation for two weeks.

06:20.518 --> 06:22.619
In that time, you've authorized
the use of a civilian

06:22.621 --> 06:24.487
in a dangerous FBI operation.

06:24.489 --> 06:26.856
And one of Tal's top
lieutenants hung himself

06:26.858 --> 06:28.524
after being questioned by your team.

06:28.526 --> 06:30.226
Sorry, is there a point here somewhere?

06:30.228 --> 06:31.694
Is Erica Shepherd
influencing your decisions?

06:31.696 --> 06:34.030
Erica Shepherd is a convicted
felon and a traitor.

06:34.032 --> 06:35.632
Is she influencing your decisions?

06:35.634 --> 06:36.766
No.

06:39.437 --> 06:41.843
I don't think you should be
running the Tal investigation.

06:42.374 --> 06:43.373
What?

06:44.909 --> 06:46.142
No one at the Bureau
has been living with this

06:46.144 --> 06:47.844
as long as I have.

06:47.846 --> 06:49.779
Which is exactly why you
are the wrong person for it.

06:52.217 --> 06:54.167
You're not objective.
You're not unbiased.

06:55.854 --> 06:57.654
You are a victim.

07:01.359 --> 07:05.395
My fiancÃ©e is a victim...
murdered by Mikhail Tal.

07:05.397 --> 07:07.797
Well, good luck catching Aksoy.

07:07.799 --> 07:09.198
I'll be watching.

07:21.413 --> 07:23.103
- Jacquie.
- Hey, Bragg. What's up?

07:23.105 --> 07:24.614
What are you doing here?

07:24.616 --> 07:27.216
- Keaton didn't tell you?
- Tell me what?

07:27.218 --> 07:28.718
I'm on the team now.

07:28.720 --> 07:30.787
That's very funny.

07:30.789 --> 07:33.589
It's no joke, honey. We're teammates now.

07:33.591 --> 07:34.924
Keaton pushed the paperwork through,

07:34.926 --> 07:37.660
and the Deputy Director signed off.

07:37.662 --> 07:41.164
Looks like all your wildest
dreams finally came true.

07:42.734 --> 07:44.634
Is that my chair?

07:44.636 --> 07:46.035
Bragg, Pettigrew, conference room, now.

07:49.307 --> 07:51.174
Been ten hours since Aksoy
crossed the U.S. border.

07:51.176 --> 07:52.479
Where are we on the search?

07:52.481 --> 07:54.510
I checked with local
and New York State Police.

07:54.512 --> 07:55.907
They turned up nothing.
I think he fled the area.

07:55.909 --> 07:56.987
Kate?

07:56.989 --> 07:58.715
I issued a nationwide bulletin of Aksoy,

07:58.717 --> 08:01.360
and I'm scanning police reports
within a 500 mile radius

08:01.385 --> 08:02.684
of the border, so with any luck,

08:02.686 --> 08:05.061
he gets flagged trying to steal a
car or break into a residence.

08:05.062 --> 08:06.395
All right, so what you're
telling me is we have nothing.

08:06.397 --> 08:07.763
I know it's not what
you wanted to hear, boss,

08:07.765 --> 08:09.231
but finding some guy with no friends,

08:09.233 --> 08:11.133
no family, it's like finding a needle

08:11.135 --> 08:12.635
in a stack of needles.

08:13.704 --> 08:16.772
Aksoy might not have had
any connections to the U.S.

08:16.774 --> 08:19.575
But Demir was an American.
Who was she close to?

08:20.845 --> 08:23.298
In prison she mentioned a sister, Sila.

08:23.300 --> 08:24.747
She might be a vulnerability.

08:24.749 --> 08:25.948
You think this sister might
have shared the same

08:25.950 --> 08:27.516
- anti-American sentiment?
- It's possible.

08:27.518 --> 08:29.218
Maybe Aksoy was planning
to meet with her.

08:29.220 --> 08:30.552
Get some cash, a place to stay.

08:30.554 --> 08:32.554
She could be a shelter in the storm.

08:32.556 --> 08:34.188
So let's bring her in,
see what she knows.

08:34.191 --> 08:36.025
I say we put her under surveillance.

08:36.027 --> 08:38.527
If she's helping Aksoy,
he might come to her

08:38.529 --> 08:40.212
or she could lead us right to him.

08:47.972 --> 08:49.405
Pettigrew's right.

08:49.407 --> 08:51.340
Let's get a team on Demir's
sister right away.

08:51.342 --> 08:53.142
And I wanna know everything
there is to know

08:53.144 --> 08:54.977
about this Sila Demir.

08:54.979 --> 08:57.546
Her social media profile,
vehicle registration,

08:57.548 --> 08:59.665
financial records,
travel history, everything.

08:59.667 --> 09:01.817
All right, clock's ticking, people.
Let's move.

09:04.822 --> 09:06.588
I need to speak with you.

09:06.590 --> 09:07.723
What's up?

09:07.725 --> 09:09.258
Laine's father reached out to me.

09:10.828 --> 09:13.429
- What does he want?
- He left a message.

09:13.431 --> 09:14.978
I haven't called him back yet.

09:15.466 --> 09:17.599
Do you think he knows I've been
working with Shepherd?

09:17.601 --> 09:18.701
What makes you say that?

09:18.703 --> 09:20.269
Because he's calling Will, too.

09:20.271 --> 09:22.538
I saw his phone in the briefing room.

09:22.540 --> 09:24.490
I can't not talk to him, Daniel.

09:24.492 --> 09:26.322
Lane was like a sister to me.

09:27.111 --> 09:28.410
Call him.

09:28.412 --> 09:29.945
And what if he asks about Shepherd?

09:29.947 --> 09:31.246
Tell him the truth.

09:31.248 --> 09:32.948
Will chose to work
with Shepherd, not you.

09:32.950 --> 09:34.149
It's not your secret to keep.

09:40.958 --> 09:42.491
Agent Keaton.

09:42.493 --> 09:43.692
Anna, how are you?

09:43.694 --> 09:45.427
- Settling in okay?
- Yes, thank you.

09:45.429 --> 09:46.395
Good.

09:48.833 --> 09:51.383
I know I pressured you
a little into bringing me on

09:51.385 --> 09:54.303
to the investigation,
but I really appreciate it.

09:54.305 --> 09:56.438
Well, I needed the best
people I can find hunting Tal,

09:56.440 --> 09:57.446
and you're one of them.

09:57.471 --> 09:59.105
So, how are things going? Any leads?

09:59.107 --> 10:01.110
Uh, I went through the financial records

10:01.112 --> 10:02.567
you asked me to take a look at.

10:03.080 --> 10:04.980
It's gonna take some time,
but there's some promising

10:04.982 --> 10:07.349
- material there.
- All right, good. Well, keep me posted.

10:07.351 --> 10:09.318
We're going to find Tal.

10:09.320 --> 10:12.221
- I know it.
- Me too.

10:12.223 --> 10:14.990
Oh, Will. Your tie.

10:24.602 --> 10:26.502
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

10:32.710 --> 10:34.326
What's Anna Cruz doing here?

10:34.328 --> 10:36.145
She's on loan from the CIA.

10:36.147 --> 10:38.347
Keaton brought her over to help
with the investigation

10:38.349 --> 10:39.548
into Tal's finances.

10:41.318 --> 10:42.651
She's been through a lot.

10:42.653 --> 10:45.320
This is Keaton's way of helping her out.

10:45.322 --> 10:47.022
I wonder if she's helping him, too.

10:50.227 --> 10:51.960
Could you please escort her
back to holding?

10:58.002 --> 10:59.524
Hey, where you headed?

10:59.526 --> 11:01.870
Over to State to get
Sila Demir's travel records.

11:01.872 --> 11:03.199
You talk to anyone at the DMV yet?

11:03.201 --> 11:04.206
Called twice already.

11:04.208 --> 11:05.641
I'm still waiting to hear back
from my contact.

11:05.643 --> 11:06.964
All right, let me know when you do.

11:07.545 --> 11:09.759
- Uh, hey, Bragg.
- Yeah.

11:10.514 --> 11:13.282
Working with Shepherd, is
this gonna be a regular thing?

11:13.284 --> 11:14.850
Starting to look that way.

11:14.852 --> 11:16.518
I mean, I know Daniel and Kate
aren't happy about it.

11:16.520 --> 11:17.820
- And you are?
- No.

11:17.822 --> 11:19.588
But I'll put up with almost anything

11:19.590 --> 11:21.229
if it means catching Aksoy.

11:21.859 --> 11:24.357
I mean, I agreed to work with
you and everything, right?

11:27.631 --> 11:29.665
This is Agent Pettigrew. It's about time.

11:35.372 --> 11:36.678
What's up, Pettigrew?

11:36.680 --> 11:40.375
Sila Demir owns a gold 1990
Toyota Corolla

11:40.377 --> 11:44.646
- License plate A5N4QPE.
- So...

11:44.648 --> 11:46.548
So ten minutes ago, the surveillance team

11:46.550 --> 11:49.340
saw Demir board the LocalLink bus line.

11:49.887 --> 11:52.554
- No car.
- No car.

11:52.556 --> 11:54.456
I checked with the agents
covering her apartment, too.

11:54.458 --> 11:55.591
It's not there, either.

11:55.593 --> 11:57.359
I'm thinking she gave it to Aksoy.

11:57.361 --> 12:00.229
Get everybody on this.
I want that car found now.

12:16.580 --> 12:19.681
Hey, you can't park there, dude.

12:21.652 --> 12:24.319
Uh, I didn't know, man. Sorry.

12:24.321 --> 12:25.754
They normally give you a placard

12:25.756 --> 12:26.837
when you drive into the facility.

12:26.839 --> 12:29.024
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:29.026 --> 12:30.147
It's in here somewhere.

12:32.763 --> 12:34.096
Gotta call this into dispatch.

12:34.098 --> 12:35.631
Okay.

12:36.901 --> 12:38.300
Not a problem.

13:00.556 --> 13:02.221
Hannah.

13:02.791 --> 13:05.726
- Hi, Agent Keaton.
- You wanted to see me?

13:05.728 --> 13:07.060
I was hoping I could see my mom.

13:08.163 --> 13:09.746
Hannah, you can't just
show up here like that

13:09.748 --> 13:11.131
and expect to see her.

13:11.133 --> 13:12.699
Why not?

13:12.701 --> 13:14.001
Because there are rules.

13:14.970 --> 13:16.136
What are they?

13:16.138 --> 13:17.604
For starters, I need advance notice.

13:17.606 --> 13:19.039
Okay.

13:19.041 --> 13:21.842
It's just, my mom left a message for me

13:21.844 --> 13:24.428
and I figured you were the one
who let her use a phone.

13:25.514 --> 13:26.896
Were you?

13:27.935 --> 13:29.216
Yes.

13:29.218 --> 13:30.571
You're working with her, aren't you?

13:30.573 --> 13:32.860
- Hannah, listen, I don't think...
- I won't tell anyone. I promise.

13:33.656 --> 13:35.255
I just want to see her.

14:00.849 --> 14:03.244
It's so good to see you again.

14:04.559 --> 14:06.125
I didn't know if I would.

14:08.691 --> 14:10.557
Did you get my voicemail?

14:10.559 --> 14:12.426
- Mm-hmm.
- You did?

14:12.428 --> 14:14.314
Sort of listened to it a lot.

14:14.316 --> 14:17.297
- You did?
- Like, ten times.

14:20.669 --> 14:22.535
Did you mean all those things you said?

14:24.440 --> 14:26.039
Every single word.

14:28.410 --> 14:30.835
Thank you for coming, Hannah.

14:33.414 --> 14:35.213
Oh, God, Hannah...

14:36.218 --> 14:38.798
- I have so many questions.
- What do you wanna know?

14:38.800 --> 14:42.089
Everything. I wanna know everything
that happened while I was gone.

14:42.091 --> 14:44.591
I don't think we have that much time.

14:44.593 --> 14:46.142
Well, maybe we'll find it.

14:47.029 --> 14:48.929
I might be here for a while.

14:49.270 --> 14:52.071
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I hope so.

14:52.901 --> 14:54.768
You said that school's going well.

14:54.770 --> 14:56.703
- Mm-hmm.
- You getting good grades?

14:56.705 --> 14:59.639
Yeah, four A's and two B's last semester.

15:01.477 --> 15:03.443
- No, I'm taking French now.
- What about volleyball?

15:03.445 --> 15:04.745
You playing club now?

15:06.704 --> 15:08.181
No.

15:08.183 --> 15:09.483
Why not? You love it.

15:09.485 --> 15:11.051
- What happened?
- I just got...

15:13.022 --> 15:16.123
Tired of it. I quit.

15:16.125 --> 15:17.758
No, you didn't. Something happened.

15:17.760 --> 15:18.759
What?

15:22.731 --> 15:24.014
Tell me, Hannah.

15:26.735 --> 15:29.803
Some of the kids on the other
teams found out about you.

15:31.840 --> 15:35.409
Dad thought it would be a good
idea to stop for a while.

15:39.681 --> 15:41.982
- How is your dad?
- Okay.

15:41.984 --> 15:45.619
He was sad after you left,
but he's been better lately.

15:45.621 --> 15:46.732
Good.

15:49.391 --> 15:51.158
- Does he know that you're here?
- No.

15:51.160 --> 15:52.659
Okay.

15:52.661 --> 15:55.262
Maybe that's for the best, right?

15:55.264 --> 15:57.531
He's a good father. He always has been.

15:59.501 --> 16:01.061
I know.

16:04.239 --> 16:06.373
I know you have a lot of questions.

16:06.375 --> 16:09.042
I know you want answers.
I'm really sorry, Hannah.

16:11.080 --> 16:12.846
It's okay.

16:12.848 --> 16:14.314
I want my mom more.

16:18.220 --> 16:19.386
I got it.

16:20.989 --> 16:23.757
Sila Demir's vehicle was caught
by a license plate reader

16:23.759 --> 16:25.559
entering Fort McHenry tunnel.

16:25.561 --> 16:27.427
Is there a image of the driver?

16:27.429 --> 16:29.496
Uh, I don't have one yet,
but I'm scanning CCTV cameras

16:29.498 --> 16:30.931
and toll booth footage now.

16:30.933 --> 16:32.103
Where's he headed?

16:34.570 --> 16:36.636
That tunnel is the main entry
to the Port of Maryland.

16:36.638 --> 16:38.105
That has to be Aksoy.

16:44.546 --> 16:46.313
Do you need to get that?

16:46.315 --> 16:47.347
No.

16:47.349 --> 16:48.915
I'm headed to that port now.

16:48.917 --> 16:50.183
Tell Bragg and Pettigrew
to meet me in the lobby.

16:50.185 --> 16:51.298
I'll grab Daniel.

16:57.593 --> 17:00.060
Aksoy's vehicle was located
inside this port facility.

17:00.062 --> 17:01.761
Keep your eyes open and stay alert.

17:01.763 --> 17:02.963
He's here.

17:41.303 --> 17:42.769
I got him!

18:37.392 --> 18:38.792
- You all right?
- I'm good.

18:38.794 --> 18:39.826
He's headed north.

18:39.828 --> 18:40.827
He's coming to you guys.

19:02.017 --> 19:04.351
Don't let him exit! Don't let him exit!

19:39.265 --> 19:40.465
Yeah, absolutely.

19:43.471 --> 19:44.937
- Hey.
- Bragg.

19:44.939 --> 19:46.856
That evidence response team
find anything yet?

19:46.858 --> 19:48.824
No, not yet, but we're still
combing through all these boxes

19:48.826 --> 19:50.426
in the cargo container.

19:50.428 --> 19:51.994
- Any sign he targeted others?
- No.

19:51.996 --> 19:54.197
The port's tracking system
shows that Aksoy's device

19:54.199 --> 19:56.315
was only used to track
this one carton container.

19:56.317 --> 19:57.300
And what about point of origin?

19:57.302 --> 19:58.568
You track anything down yet?

19:58.570 --> 20:00.536
Yeah, some company based out of Shanghai.

20:00.538 --> 20:02.805
They manufacture patient
monitoring equipment

20:02.807 --> 20:05.942
like CT, Ultrasound, MRIs,
and some X-Ray gear.

20:05.944 --> 20:07.510
That equipment is way too
large to move on its own.

20:07.512 --> 20:08.765
Maybe it's what's inside that he's after.

20:08.767 --> 20:09.878
Yeah, it could be.

20:09.880 --> 20:11.981
Looks like Aksoy tampered with
one of the MRI machines.

20:11.983 --> 20:13.549
We're not sure to what extent.

20:13.551 --> 20:16.319
Also, checking inventory,
there's another component

20:16.321 --> 20:18.387
piece missing, which is an MRI knee coil.

20:18.389 --> 20:20.017
That significant to anyone?

20:20.625 --> 20:22.091
All right, Bragg, we'll look
into things on our end.

20:22.093 --> 20:23.226
Let us know if you find anything else.

20:23.228 --> 20:24.193
All right, copy.

20:27.899 --> 20:30.032
Kate, pull the technical
specs on the devices

20:30.034 --> 20:31.239
inside that container.

20:31.241 --> 20:32.935
See if any contain radioactive material.

20:34.939 --> 20:37.406
The amount of radioactive
material we could be

20:37.408 --> 20:38.557
talking about, is that enough

20:38.559 --> 20:39.976
to be a substantial threat?

20:39.978 --> 20:42.245
Dispersed correctly
in a crowded metro station

20:42.247 --> 20:43.646
or an office building, absolutely.

20:43.648 --> 20:45.648
You could have dozens
if not hundreds of victims.

20:45.650 --> 20:47.083
- Kate?
- You got it.

20:48.469 --> 20:49.652
I see you're still here.

20:49.654 --> 20:51.387
My counterparts at Interpol

20:51.389 --> 20:52.989
are still on their first cup of coffee.

20:52.991 --> 20:54.123
I would tell you to go home,

20:54.125 --> 20:55.524
but I know you won't listen anyway.

20:55.526 --> 20:57.293
You work harder than anyone I know.

20:57.295 --> 20:58.561
Just trying to keep up.

20:58.563 --> 21:00.162
Maybe we both need some balance.

21:00.164 --> 21:03.099
Maybe it's just how people
like us are wired.

21:05.870 --> 21:06.919
Keaton.

21:09.140 --> 21:10.940
I've been thinking of a way of exposing

21:10.942 --> 21:13.075
Tal's network of operatives.

21:14.178 --> 21:15.177
Excuse me.

21:17.949 --> 21:20.483
- The FBI's PCI files on Tal.
- What about them?

21:20.485 --> 21:21.724
Give me access to them.

21:21.726 --> 21:23.753
Those files contain the names
and personal information

21:23.755 --> 21:25.488
on thousands of paid
confidential informants.

21:25.490 --> 21:26.589
You're not gonna get access to that.

21:26.591 --> 21:27.591
Well, I could vet the names.

21:27.593 --> 21:29.542
I could look for links between
the FBI informants

21:29.544 --> 21:31.160
and CIA-suspected Tal operatives.

21:31.162 --> 21:33.195
- It could move us forward.
- No.

21:33.197 --> 21:34.664
- Why not?
- Because I said so.

21:34.666 --> 21:37.166
Those files are off limits.
You're not getting access.

21:37.168 --> 21:39.435
No stone left unturned.
That's how we find Tal.

21:39.437 --> 21:41.437
- That's how we find who works...
- Shepherd.

21:43.474 --> 21:45.024
The answer is no.

22:34.125 --> 22:35.224
Do I know you?

22:51.909 --> 22:53.175
Hey, Will.

22:54.319 --> 22:55.685
Thomas.

22:56.280 --> 22:57.747
Glad I caught you.

22:57.749 --> 22:59.582
Listen, I'm sorry I've been
so tough to reach.

22:59.584 --> 23:03.052
Hey, hey, you're busy. Don't apologize.

23:03.054 --> 23:04.243
So, what brings you down here?

23:04.245 --> 23:07.289
Guess I thought you might be
able to give me some answers.

23:07.291 --> 23:08.481
I can try.

23:08.483 --> 23:11.394
I was out the country
on business for a few weeks.

23:11.396 --> 23:14.395
I came back to find people
talking about Erica Shepherd.

23:14.397 --> 23:17.733
About how she was arrested here in D.C.

23:17.735 --> 23:19.268
Do you know anything about it?

23:20.772 --> 23:21.837
I can tell you that that's true.

23:21.839 --> 23:23.539
What was she doing in D.C.?

23:25.710 --> 23:27.410
I brought her here to work
on the investigation.

23:27.412 --> 23:28.844
You're working with her?

23:28.846 --> 23:30.749
Will, how could you do this?

23:31.916 --> 23:33.335
I did it for Laine.

23:34.585 --> 23:35.751
To catch the man that killed Laine.

23:35.753 --> 23:37.286
- That's why I did it.
- Stop.

23:38.689 --> 23:40.551
Stop rationalizing.

23:41.192 --> 23:43.878
I treated you like family. I trusted you.

23:43.880 --> 23:44.938
I just think Shepherd can help.

23:44.940 --> 23:47.596
She's responsible
for my daughter's murder.

23:49.667 --> 23:52.101
What am I supposed
to tell Laine's mother?

23:53.504 --> 23:55.249
Tell her I know what I'm doing.

24:15.576 --> 24:18.727
- I can't help but wonder.
- What's that?

24:18.729 --> 24:20.257
This.

24:22.026 --> 24:23.203
You.

24:26.170 --> 24:28.471
Something happened.

24:28.473 --> 24:30.976
I'm hurting people I care deeply about.

24:32.076 --> 24:33.676
I know what that feels like.

24:33.678 --> 24:34.980
You think you know me?

24:35.480 --> 24:37.941
No, but I may understand you.

24:38.916 --> 24:41.884
I'm not impervious to anguish
or grief, Agent Keaton.

24:41.886 --> 24:43.769
- I feel them, too.
- You took everything.

24:45.584 --> 24:46.992
It wasn't just from me.

24:47.758 --> 24:49.077
I know what I did.

24:50.541 --> 24:52.674
I think you may need to ask yourself

24:52.699 --> 24:55.500
what you're willing
to endure to catch Tal.

25:32.937 --> 25:34.503
- Senator Covington?
- Yes.

25:34.505 --> 25:35.871
We've got a private area for you to use

25:35.873 --> 25:37.806
- until your plane departs.
- Good, thank you.

25:59.096 --> 26:00.129
You have your badge?

26:00.131 --> 26:01.608
Yeah.

26:02.166 --> 26:03.165
Here you go.

26:05.937 --> 26:07.336
Where you headed?

26:07.338 --> 26:09.538
I'm just, uh, grabbing tools
from the hangar.

26:09.540 --> 26:12.641
I've got an A380 with
a baggage door issue.

26:12.643 --> 26:14.109
Ah, you know, if the plane's not on time,

26:14.111 --> 26:15.778
who do you think they're gonna blame?

26:15.780 --> 26:17.162
You know what they say rolls
downhill, don't you?

26:17.164 --> 26:18.647
Be safe.

27:07.498 --> 27:08.747
Attention all passengers.

27:08.749 --> 27:10.833
Flight 881 to Las Vegas...

27:10.835 --> 27:13.402
1740 to Phoenix has been cancelled

27:13.404 --> 27:17.706
and 4236 to Atlanta
has also been canceled.

27:21.646 --> 27:24.513
BWI just declared an ATC-Zero.

27:24.515 --> 27:26.448
They've lost all air traffic
control capabilities.

27:26.450 --> 27:27.483
Have they established a cause?

27:27.485 --> 27:28.845
It's unknown at this point.

27:28.847 --> 27:31.553
There's been no report
of an explosion or a fire.

27:31.555 --> 27:33.055
Cyber attack?

27:33.057 --> 27:34.857
I considered that,
but the engineers aren't

27:34.859 --> 27:36.453
showing a breach of their network.

27:37.128 --> 27:40.129
The MRI knee coil that Aksoy
took from the cargo container,

27:40.131 --> 27:42.765
inside the component are gradient coils

27:42.767 --> 27:45.100
that produce a, uh,
uniform magnetic field.

27:45.102 --> 27:46.885
It's a critical part
of the imaging process.

27:46.887 --> 27:49.772
Airplane radar can be
affected by magnetic fields.

27:49.774 --> 27:51.473
I think Aksoy took out

27:51.475 --> 27:53.075
the entire air traffic
control system at the airport.

27:55.713 --> 27:57.279
What's his next move?

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
- Please.
- It's canceled, oh!

28:14.002 --> 28:15.084
Ridiculous.

28:15.086 --> 28:16.757
Don't you see I'm trying to talk to her?

28:16.758 --> 28:18.375
When will the flights be rescheduled?

28:18.377 --> 28:20.427
- Like, what are the options?
- No, see...

28:23.015 --> 28:25.182
An airport employee
was found shot to death.

28:25.184 --> 28:27.017
The victim's name is Greg Johnson.

28:27.019 --> 28:29.019
They were unable to find his airport ID.

28:29.021 --> 28:30.854
Security is checking to see
if it's been used

28:30.856 --> 28:32.209
to access the airport.

28:32.211 --> 28:34.024
All right, have security
teams scan the CCTV footage

28:34.026 --> 28:35.450
for Aksoy.

28:35.452 --> 28:37.794
Also find out if air traffic
control figured out the cause

28:37.796 --> 28:38.945
- of the shutdown yet.
- All right, will do.

28:42.568 --> 28:44.901
Kate, need you to pull
the blueprints of the airport.

28:44.903 --> 28:46.769
Terminals as well as the maps
to restricted areas.

28:46.771 --> 28:47.791
I'm on it.

28:47.793 --> 28:49.508
Need you to be my eyes
and ears here, Kate.

28:49.510 --> 28:51.408
Navigating this airport
and hunting down Aksoy

28:51.410 --> 28:53.710
- is gonna be a challenge.
- Okay.

28:53.712 --> 28:54.896
I got an idea.

28:59.635 --> 29:01.635
This place moves 60,000 passengers a day.

29:01.637 --> 29:03.753
- The longer it's shut down...
- The worse it gets.

29:03.755 --> 29:05.555
It's chaos.

29:05.557 --> 29:07.367
Find out which VIP passengers travel

29:07.369 --> 29:08.381
through the airport today.

29:08.383 --> 29:10.505
Focus on the ones with security detail.

29:11.096 --> 29:13.597
Have Kate contact DHS if necessary.

29:13.599 --> 29:14.764
You got it.

29:17.603 --> 29:20.570
Four congressmen, three senators,

29:20.572 --> 29:24.574
a brigadier general,
and the CEO of Gryfyn Systems.

29:24.576 --> 29:25.609
I'm sending you photos now.

29:25.611 --> 29:26.943
What's their status?

29:26.945 --> 29:28.578
The congressman and the general

29:28.580 --> 29:30.627
are aboard grounded planes on the tarmac.

29:30.629 --> 29:31.665
Shepherd?

29:31.667 --> 29:33.450
She brought in the case, Daniel.

29:33.452 --> 29:35.752
She worked the asset.
It is my call to bring her up.

29:35.754 --> 29:37.787
Send me everything you have
on the VIPs, Kate.

29:37.789 --> 29:41.091
I'm pulling everything now.

29:41.093 --> 29:44.761
At this hour, BWI remains shut down.

29:44.763 --> 29:46.680
All inbound flights have been diverted,

29:46.682 --> 29:48.765
- Sir?
- Yes.

29:48.767 --> 29:50.277
Your staff is arranging for you to depart

29:50.279 --> 29:51.435
from a different airport.

29:51.437 --> 29:52.769
They're having the car
brought back around now.

29:52.771 --> 29:54.020
Okay, thanks.

29:54.022 --> 29:55.939
When asked for comment,

29:55.941 --> 29:57.807
the FAA and other airport
officials say that...

29:57.809 --> 29:59.643
Dad, this is so strange.

29:59.645 --> 30:01.681
No one seems to know what happened.

30:02.648 --> 30:04.614
- Maybe we shouldn't go.
- Oh.

30:04.616 --> 30:06.149
Sweetheart, there's nothing
to worry about.

30:06.151 --> 30:07.534
We're protected.

30:09.204 --> 30:11.955
Keaton said Aksoy took out
the airport's radar system.

30:11.957 --> 30:12.956
Police haven't swept it yet.

30:49.027 --> 30:50.827
Hey, Jacquie, come check this out.

30:50.829 --> 30:52.529
I got something.

31:03.842 --> 31:05.925
- Keaton.
- Pettigrew, what do you got?

31:05.927 --> 31:07.594
Aksoy built a portable EMP.

31:07.596 --> 31:09.212
He planted it near the airport radar.

31:09.214 --> 31:11.348
The electromagnetic pulse will
put everything offline.

31:13.719 --> 31:16.052
Will, think I got something.

31:16.054 --> 31:17.220
Kate just sent this.

31:17.222 --> 31:19.055
Senator Martin Covington.

31:19.057 --> 31:21.558
He has deep ties to defense
contractors in his state.

31:21.560 --> 31:23.693
He was helping secure millions
in government contracts.

31:23.695 --> 31:25.195
He's also an outspoken proponent

31:25.197 --> 31:27.564
of increased drone flights
from Incirlik Air Base

31:27.566 --> 31:28.732
- in Turkey.
- He's our target.

31:28.734 --> 31:30.116
Think so.

31:30.118 --> 31:32.786
Kate, help us locate
Martin Covington, senator.

31:32.788 --> 31:34.291
- Sir?
- Yes?

31:34.293 --> 31:35.372
Your car's just arrived.

31:35.374 --> 31:36.373
When you're ready, we can head down.

31:36.375 --> 31:37.374
Great. Okay, honey.

31:42.881 --> 31:44.130
Keaton, where are you?

31:44.132 --> 31:45.582
Headed to the lounge.

31:45.584 --> 31:47.083
- The senator's being moved.
- Where?

31:47.085 --> 31:48.918
They're using an exit below the terminal.

31:48.920 --> 31:51.588
Aksoy shut down the airport
in order to target Covington

31:51.590 --> 31:53.723
so it stands to reason he knows
how they'll move the senator.

31:53.725 --> 31:55.225
Tell me where to go.

31:55.227 --> 31:57.143
I'm using AI to stitch
together CCTV images

31:57.145 --> 31:58.144
of the terminal.

32:24.423 --> 32:26.122
Keaton, where are you now?

32:26.124 --> 32:28.625
We're in the main corridor
just south of the lounge.

32:28.627 --> 32:30.927
Have everybody on standby
ready to evacuate.

32:30.929 --> 32:33.263
There's a restricted usage
door straight ahead.

32:35.333 --> 32:36.766
Take that.

32:52.117 --> 32:53.281
Now what?

32:53.283 --> 32:54.383
Keep going.

32:54.385 --> 32:56.152
There's a door at the bottom
of the stairs that leads

32:56.154 --> 32:59.122
to a corridor. Beyond that is a tunnel.

33:26.485 --> 33:27.901
Aksoy!

33:36.862 --> 33:37.994
Daniel, check the senator!

33:40.332 --> 33:41.998
I'll get him out of here! Go!

34:27.782 --> 34:29.782
"This is sponsored by Microsoft"

36:41.539 --> 36:44.622
Took Aksoy into custody
about an hour ago.

36:45.197 --> 36:48.474
We're hoping that he gives us
some intel on overseas plots

36:48.476 --> 36:50.405
against the U.S. and its allies.

36:50.407 --> 36:52.057
Nice work flagging him for us.

36:52.059 --> 36:54.010
Oh.

36:54.767 --> 36:56.466
It's good to be working again.

36:58.532 --> 37:00.099
Your daughter.

37:01.968 --> 37:04.068
She's been visiting you without
her father's knowledge.

37:05.598 --> 37:08.833
- Is that a problem?
- You tell me.

37:11.807 --> 37:15.208
Chris left me the day
that I was arrested.

37:16.324 --> 37:18.645
I used to blame him for it. I don't now.

37:20.282 --> 37:21.915
He made a lot of sacrifices
for my career,

37:21.917 --> 37:23.450
and I betrayed him.

37:23.452 --> 37:24.518
He's not the kind
of person who'd get over

37:24.520 --> 37:25.719
something like that.

37:25.721 --> 37:27.287
Why not just tell him the truth?

37:29.458 --> 37:30.423
Well...

37:32.161 --> 37:37.197
You have to understand that
the agents that I lost

37:37.199 --> 37:38.398
were like family to us.

37:39.902 --> 37:41.368
Not a single one of them had ever missed

37:41.370 --> 37:43.303
one of Hannah's birthdays.

37:43.305 --> 37:46.840
So if I told Chris,
then I fear that he would

37:46.842 --> 37:48.942
go public to try to save me.

37:50.746 --> 37:52.579
And that would mean that Hannah
would have to live

37:52.581 --> 37:54.514
the rest of her life knowing
that she was alive

37:54.516 --> 37:55.765
because they weren't.

37:59.922 --> 38:01.788
If Chris finds out I'm meeting her,

38:01.790 --> 38:03.089
he'll put an end to it.

38:04.960 --> 38:08.461
I spent the last three years
barely surviving without her.

38:08.463 --> 38:09.462
So...

38:11.400 --> 38:12.782
I'm not sure I could
go through that again.

38:16.038 --> 38:18.471
And you're willing to lie to ensure that?

38:20.209 --> 38:21.374
I'd do anything.

38:24.980 --> 38:26.602
If he asks me...

38:28.217 --> 38:30.016
I will tell him the truth.

38:34.790 --> 38:36.323
I know you will.

38:52.174 --> 38:53.273
Excuse me.

38:54.676 --> 38:56.376
- Can I help you?
- I hope so.

38:56.378 --> 38:57.644
I'm sort of desperate.

38:57.646 --> 38:59.779
Our network isn't working.

38:59.781 --> 39:01.261
- I think.
- I can send a tech.

39:01.263 --> 39:02.282
But you're gonna have to file

39:02.284 --> 39:03.433
an official request for support.

39:03.435 --> 39:05.151
I work with the Colntel Division.

39:05.153 --> 39:07.187
But I won't be for long if I can't access

39:07.189 --> 39:09.222
the information I need before
the briefing this afternoon.

39:10.442 --> 39:11.491
I got some maintenance to perform here.

39:11.493 --> 39:13.126
I'm sure it won't take long.

39:15.731 --> 39:16.863
Please?

39:21.203 --> 39:23.069
I will head up there now.

39:23.071 --> 39:24.571
Thank you so much.

39:24.573 --> 39:26.406
I'm meeting a DOJ contact in the lobby,

39:26.408 --> 39:27.707
but I'll be right up.

39:27.709 --> 39:28.792
No problem.

40:32.787 --> 40:35.106
You left a note on my desk.

40:36.111 --> 40:38.144
What is this about?

40:38.146 --> 40:39.279
Your secret is showing.

40:45.220 --> 40:47.253
You have feelings for Agent Keaton.

40:49.991 --> 40:51.691
I admire him.

40:51.693 --> 40:54.594
I'm grateful he saved my life.

40:54.596 --> 40:56.730
But what would you know about
putting someone else's

40:56.732 --> 40:58.832
well-being before your own?

40:58.834 --> 41:02.402
I mean, you left your daughter
without a mother.

41:02.404 --> 41:04.183
Hannah, right?

41:06.113 --> 41:09.109
Keaton's vulnerable since he lost Laine.

41:09.111 --> 41:11.945
He thinks you're gonna help him find Tal?

41:11.947 --> 41:15.014
You're not.
You left a stain on the agency.

41:15.016 --> 41:18.385
You damaged the institution.
You damaged Keaton.

41:19.788 --> 41:21.861
You didn't just take away Laine.

41:22.290 --> 41:24.257
You took his ability to trust.

41:24.259 --> 41:25.859
And you're gonna give that back to him?

41:25.861 --> 41:27.160
I just want to help.

41:30.599 --> 41:32.165
I have no doubt that you do.

41:39.374 --> 41:40.740
Yeah, they've asked me to participate

41:40.742 --> 41:42.909
in a panel discussion at the conference.

41:42.911 --> 41:46.413
It's on the NGI biometrics database.

41:50.185 --> 41:51.618
I'm sorry. I gotta go.

41:53.989 --> 41:55.989
The senator's been given Naloxone,

41:55.991 --> 41:58.925
and an antidote to the Fentanyl
that Aksoy used to poison him.

41:58.927 --> 42:00.226
He's expected to make a full recovery.

42:00.228 --> 42:01.461
We saved a life today.

42:02.998 --> 42:04.664
And we took a deadly operative
off the board.

42:04.666 --> 42:07.267
Who alerted you to Aksoy
in the first place?

42:07.269 --> 42:08.658
Shepherd.

42:11.072 --> 42:13.606
Keaton, can I have a word?

42:13.608 --> 42:14.641
In private?

42:18.647 --> 42:20.013
What's going on?

42:20.015 --> 42:21.648
We had an attempted breach of one of

42:21.650 --> 42:22.866
the Bureau's encrypted networks.

42:22.868 --> 42:25.185
And whoever it was, they were careful.

42:25.187 --> 42:26.486
We barely noticed that
they were on the system.

42:26.488 --> 42:27.620
What were they after?

42:27.622 --> 42:29.823
Paid Confidential Informant files.

42:29.825 --> 42:32.509
All 15,000 of them.

42:32.511 --> 42:35.462
And the search criteria used
indicates that the focus

42:35.464 --> 42:36.663
was on Mikhail Tal.

42:44.039 --> 42:45.438
How did you do it?

42:45.440 --> 42:46.906
Do what?

42:46.908 --> 42:48.341
Did you access that terminal on your own?

42:48.343 --> 42:50.310
Or did you manipulate someone
into doing it for you?

42:50.312 --> 42:52.545
If you have an accusation
to make, Agent Keaton,

42:52.547 --> 42:53.880
then make it.

42:53.882 --> 42:55.482
You tried to access
classified intelligence

42:55.484 --> 42:58.117
on Mikhail Tal after I
explicitly told you not to.

42:58.119 --> 43:00.920
When I asked you for access
to the FBI files

43:00.922 --> 43:02.856
on Paid Confidential Informants,

43:02.858 --> 43:05.658
did you actually think that I
thought that you would say yes?

43:07.229 --> 43:10.430
I asked you so Anna Cruz
would hear me ask you.

43:12.300 --> 43:15.635
I didn't try to access
those files, Agent Keaton.

43:15.637 --> 43:17.103
Anna Cruz did.

43:17.105 --> 43:18.505
Why would she do that?

43:20.442 --> 43:25.211
Because she's a mole working for Tal.
