00:17.685 --> 00:21.387
Girl: Wind. There's
nothing else like it.

00:22.490 --> 00:25.057
Pulling you across the water
like you're flying.

00:25.059 --> 00:27.326
It's totally...

00:27.328 --> 00:29.828
Well, extreme.

00:38.072 --> 00:39.905
That's me...

00:39.907 --> 00:41.673
Megan larson.

00:41.675 --> 00:44.743
Your fairly average
teenage girl.

00:52.253 --> 00:54.387
And that's cutter.

00:54.388 --> 00:56.522
There's nothing even
remotely average about him.

01:32.293 --> 01:35.994
Over here, megan!

01:40.668 --> 01:42.267
That was sick, megan.

01:42.269 --> 01:43.502
You flatly rule.

01:43.504 --> 01:44.504
Thanks, cutter.

01:44.505 --> 01:45.838
Be my girlfriend?

01:45.840 --> 01:48.307
Um, ok.

01:49.310 --> 01:50.843
Mom, dad!

01:50.845 --> 01:51.910
Dad and I have decided

01:51.912 --> 01:53.479
To get back together, megan.

01:53.481 --> 01:55.114
And I'm never gonna act

01:55.116 --> 01:57.149
Like a little freak again.

01:57.151 --> 01:58.868
Cool.

01:58.869 --> 02:00.586
Megan, as the most
popular girl in school,

02:00.588 --> 02:01.753
I, heather hartman,

02:01.755 --> 02:05.390
Hereby welcome you
into the popular group.

02:06.861 --> 02:09.495
You rock!
Yes!
Megan, yay!

02:09.497 --> 02:10.696
Megan: Dear diary,

02:10.698 --> 02:13.699
If only life were like my dream

02:15.102 --> 02:17.169
Die, alien, die!

02:17.171 --> 02:19.004
Trevor, not now.

02:19.006 --> 02:21.306
Trev!

02:21.308 --> 02:23.242
I'm just saying,

02:23.243 --> 02:25.177
You can't be
a <i> men</i> in black, trev.

02:25.179 --> 02:26.162
Why not?

02:26.163 --> 02:27.146
Because you're only one person.

02:27.148 --> 02:28.380
I want to be a men in black.

02:28.382 --> 02:31.116
I want to get jiggy wid it.

02:31.118 --> 02:32.317
Fine. Whatever.

02:32.319 --> 02:34.653
Plus, I'm gonna be a mailman.

02:34.655 --> 02:37.055
Why not mailmen?

02:38.526 --> 02:40.058
Dad we don't see much anymore.

02:40.060 --> 02:42.027
He's always busy, it seems like.

02:42.029 --> 02:44.563
Sometimes I can barely even
remember a time

02:44.565 --> 02:46.165
When we were all together.

02:46.167 --> 02:48.834
But then I always do.

02:48.836 --> 02:50.669
Kathy:
Ok, grab your stuff.

02:50.671 --> 02:52.404
Roky, come on.

02:52.406 --> 02:53.305
Trevor.

02:53.307 --> 02:54.339
Ok, we're off.

02:54.341 --> 02:56.808
Fun in the sun.

03:00.347 --> 03:01.480
Uh, let me get this.

03:03.250 --> 03:04.149
Just a sec.

03:04.151 --> 03:05.551
Hello, fred larson.

03:05.553 --> 03:07.419
Yeah, no, no.

03:07.421 --> 03:08.720
Come on. Let's go.

03:08.722 --> 03:10.556
No, that's fine.

03:10.557 --> 03:12.391
No. If you can just
get rid of them...

03:14.695 --> 03:16.828
Give it back, megan.

03:16.830 --> 03:18.463
Whoo!

03:18.666 --> 03:21.567
Dad, come on!

03:23.437 --> 03:24.403
I got it in the car.

03:24.405 --> 03:26.405
Just bear with me one second

03:26.407 --> 03:28.407
While I just...

03:29.677 --> 03:31.777
Give me just one second, here.

03:31.779 --> 03:34.012
Just got the book here...

03:34.515 --> 03:37.349
Fred: If you
have any problems,
just give me a call.

03:37.351 --> 03:39.518
No, give me a call anytime.

03:39.520 --> 03:43.188
Ok, then.
Great talking to you.

03:43.190 --> 03:44.590
Take care.

03:44.592 --> 03:47.426
Ok, then, bye.

03:47.428 --> 03:49.428
Well, diary, if you're wondering

03:49.430 --> 03:50.362
Why my folks split up,

03:50.364 --> 03:52.698
There you have it, I guess.

03:54.802 --> 03:55.767
And then there's mom.

03:55.769 --> 03:57.736
Probably the only person
on the planet

03:57.738 --> 03:59.871
Who loves windsurfing
as much as I do.

03:59.873 --> 04:03.575
She's definitely not
your typical mom.

04:03.577 --> 04:04.910
Crackers?

04:04.912 --> 04:06.912
Cool, I love crackers.

04:06.914 --> 04:09.081
So do I, but not for breakfast.

04:09.083 --> 04:10.716
Is that it?

04:10.718 --> 04:12.568
Don't be silly, megan.

04:12.569 --> 04:14.419
What kind of mother gives
her kids just crackers

04:14.421 --> 04:17.189
Without soup.

04:17.558 --> 04:20.259
Mom, you can't have
soup for breakfast.

04:20.261 --> 04:21.627
Why not, megan?
Soup is good food.

04:21.629 --> 04:25.664
Roky likes soup
for breakfast, don't you?

04:25.666 --> 04:27.332
Roky's a dog.

04:27.334 --> 04:28.400
He drinks from the toilet.

04:28.402 --> 04:32.671
Ok, let's see what else
I can make you, meg.

04:32.673 --> 04:35.007
Uh, ah!

04:35.009 --> 04:37.309
I can make a wonderful
tuna sandwich.

04:37.311 --> 04:39.611
Ok, I don't want you
to get the wrong idea.

04:39.613 --> 04:42.014
Mom's not usually this bizarre.

04:42.016 --> 04:43.448
It's just ever since dad left,

04:43.450 --> 04:45.083
She's been a little distracted.

04:45.085 --> 04:46.752
And, I mean,
if you think about it,

04:46.754 --> 04:50.756
Our life is really cool
in lots of ways.

04:54.361 --> 04:55.093
Oh!

04:55.095 --> 04:57.296
I knew I forgot something!

04:57.298 --> 05:00.098
In the tent! In the tent!

05:02.202 --> 05:03.335
Maybe mom's lonely.

05:03.337 --> 05:06.571
But then, she's had
a couple of dates.

05:08.208 --> 05:09.374
Hyah! Oh! Ya! Ya!

05:09.376 --> 05:11.977
Hoah! Hyah!

05:11.979 --> 05:13.512
Ya! Yo! Yo!

05:13.514 --> 05:14.546
Yaaa! Ya!

05:14.548 --> 05:15.814
Unh!

05:15.816 --> 05:18.850
Is he always so enthusiastic?

05:18.852 --> 05:19.685
That's nothing.

05:19.687 --> 05:20.852
The last guy my mom dated

05:20.854 --> 05:22.387
Is still in a body cast.

05:22.389 --> 05:24.022
Body cast?

05:24.024 --> 05:26.224
They say he'll make
a full recovery,

05:26.226 --> 05:28.627
But I have my doubts.

05:32.866 --> 05:35.167
Ok, I'm not in
the popular group, diary.

05:35.169 --> 05:37.969
I should tell you
that right now.

05:40.474 --> 05:43.675
I mean, well, I was
in it for a week last year.

05:43.677 --> 05:46.378
They thought I was related
to jewel or something.

05:46.380 --> 05:48.647
Well, actually,

05:48.649 --> 05:49.915
I... I kind of told them
that I was,

05:49.917 --> 05:53.652
But when heather hartman
found out that I wasn't,

05:53.654 --> 05:55.754
Oh, it was bad.

05:57.725 --> 06:00.492
You're not
jewel's cousin, megan.

06:00.494 --> 06:02.327
Well, I have a cousin

06:02.329 --> 06:03.995
Who sort of looks like jewel,

06:03.997 --> 06:05.697
And she sings pretty well.

06:05.699 --> 06:09.601
You can't sit
at our table anymore.

06:09.603 --> 06:11.270
I'm telling you,

06:11.271 --> 06:12.938
Retractable claws
would be totally cool.

06:12.940 --> 06:15.640
That would be lame, mikey.

06:16.677 --> 06:19.010
What about x-ray vision?

06:19.012 --> 06:20.712
Shape-shifting.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.914
That'd be fresh.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.683
The truth is, though, diary,

06:24.684 --> 06:26.451
I really only want
to be in the popular group

06:26.453 --> 06:28.019
For one reason.

06:28.021 --> 06:29.021
Cutter coburn

06:29.022 --> 06:31.456
Is the most extreme kid
in high school.

06:31.458 --> 06:35.360
Last year he skated down
an entire mountain.

06:37.030 --> 06:38.130
Well, he fell, mostly,

06:38.132 --> 06:41.199
But it was still totally rad.

06:43.070 --> 06:46.304
So does anyone know the answer?

06:46.306 --> 06:48.073
Cutter?

06:48.075 --> 06:50.142
Cutter?

06:50.144 --> 06:51.109
Mr. Singh?

06:51.111 --> 06:53.578
Do you know the answer?

06:53.580 --> 06:54.479
Mr. Singh,

06:54.481 --> 06:58.049
I don't even know what
the question is.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.254
For a long time,

07:02.255 --> 07:03.755
I don't think cutter
even knew I existed,

07:03.757 --> 07:05.424
But then he started windsurfing

07:05.426 --> 07:06.625
And coming to mom's store...

07:06.627 --> 07:08.326
Man, you should
have seen the air

07:08.328 --> 07:09.461
I was getting yesterday.

07:09.463 --> 07:10.629
It was nukin' like big time.

07:10.631 --> 07:13.698
I was hitting
ramp after ramp, dude.

07:20.441 --> 07:21.973
Uh, hey.

07:21.975 --> 07:22.941
Oh, hey.

07:22.943 --> 07:24.309
I remember you from school.

07:24.311 --> 07:25.510
What's your name again?

07:25.512 --> 07:27.279
Corgan? Vegan?
Fagan?

07:27.281 --> 07:28.281
Megan.

07:28.282 --> 07:29.514
Megan.

07:29.516 --> 07:32.350
Uh, hey, do you
think I could have
some of those chips?

07:32.352 --> 07:34.319
Yeah, go ahead.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.357
Oh, man, these rule.

07:39.359 --> 07:40.192
What are they?

07:40.194 --> 07:41.693
Barbecue.
I mean, sour cream...

07:41.695 --> 07:44.429
Sour cream and onion.

07:44.431 --> 07:48.300
Windsurfing's cool,
like, you know, because...

07:48.302 --> 07:50.836
There's wind, right?

07:51.672 --> 07:54.439
And then also, you're surfing,

07:54.441 --> 07:56.475
So you're, like, windsurfing.

07:56.477 --> 07:59.277
I never thought of it that way.

07:59.279 --> 08:01.346
Well, uh, thanks for the chips,

08:01.348 --> 08:03.048
Um, megan.

08:03.050 --> 08:05.884
I'll see you on the water.

08:07.721 --> 08:08.854
I like your hair.

08:08.856 --> 08:11.890
Oh, thanks.
It's bleached.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.593
I know.

08:15.329 --> 08:17.829
But that's all
ancient history now, diary,

08:17.831 --> 08:20.832
Because everything's changed.

08:20.834 --> 08:23.001
What do you mean, you met a guy?

08:23.003 --> 08:24.336
His name is cosmo.

08:24.338 --> 08:25.370
Cosmo cola.

08:25.372 --> 08:28.173
He sounds like
an alien from space.

08:28.175 --> 08:28.907
Is he, mom?

08:28.909 --> 08:30.342
Not that I've noticed, trev.

08:30.344 --> 08:33.010
Wait a minute.
Where did you meet
this guy, mom?

08:33.013 --> 08:34.379
Uh, it's very silly.

08:34.381 --> 08:36.448
I was windsurfing...

08:37.583 --> 08:40.485
Hey! Wha... hey!

08:48.095 --> 08:48.994
It was ridiculous,

08:48.996 --> 08:50.695
But it was really great, too.

08:50.697 --> 08:52.731
Meg, he wanted to rescue me

08:52.733 --> 08:53.765
From the waves.

08:53.767 --> 08:55.600
Mom, you weren't drowning.

08:55.602 --> 08:57.936
Sure, but that's not the point.

08:57.938 --> 08:58.870
He was willing to.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.372
I have a very bad feeling.

09:00.374 --> 09:03.542
We started talking,
and we just clicked.

09:03.544 --> 09:04.544
Are you all right?

09:04.545 --> 09:07.379
I saw you
being blown about
by the wind.

09:07.381 --> 09:09.381
I'm windsurfing.

09:09.383 --> 09:10.782
I'm cos.

09:10.784 --> 09:11.950
Nice to meet you.

09:11.952 --> 09:13.919
We talked for hours,

09:13.921 --> 09:15.287
I guess, I mean...

09:15.289 --> 09:18.256
He has this childlike quality

09:18.258 --> 09:20.425
That I find so refreshing.

09:20.427 --> 09:21.927
Candy?

09:21.929 --> 09:24.696
Oh, sure.

09:25.432 --> 09:28.733
Ok, where's this
cosmo cola from.

09:28.735 --> 09:31.736
Canada. The yukon,
of all places.

09:35.042 --> 09:36.775
Mom, no one lives in the yukon.

09:36.777 --> 09:37.993
It's, like, deserted.

09:37.994 --> 09:39.210
It's a missile range
or something.

09:39.212 --> 09:41.379
Well, he and his
daughter live there.

09:41.381 --> 09:42.314
His daughter?

09:42.316 --> 09:44.416
Ariel. She's 14,
too, meg.

09:44.418 --> 09:45.784
Isn't that great?

09:45.786 --> 09:47.118
Possibly.

09:47.120 --> 09:48.120
Meg.

09:48.121 --> 09:50.088
Do I look like a geek?

09:50.090 --> 09:52.390
Ok, bye.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.827
I'll be home soon.

09:56.797 --> 10:00.599
 She's got mystery 

10:00.601 --> 10:03.602
 there's a secret
in her eyes 

10:03.604 --> 10:07.339
 she's my
soul satisfier 

10:07.341 --> 10:10.408
 she's my sweetie pie 

10:10.410 --> 10:13.345
 free my frozen heart 

10:13.347 --> 10:16.748
 free my frozen heart 

10:16.750 --> 10:19.484
 what a rush 

10:27.194 --> 10:28.259
Hey.

10:28.261 --> 10:30.362
Mom.

10:30.363 --> 10:32.464
Why won't you let anyone
listen to your music?

10:32.466 --> 10:33.466
Because.

10:33.467 --> 10:36.468
Well, at least you
have a good reason.

10:36.470 --> 10:38.103
So, tonight's
the big night, huh?

10:38.105 --> 10:40.839
Everybody's finally gonna meet.

10:40.841 --> 10:42.540
Aren't you excited?

10:42.542 --> 10:45.210
Don't I look excited?

10:46.213 --> 10:47.712
Come on, you.
Help me clean up.

10:47.714 --> 10:48.947
I was going to be ambitious

10:48.949 --> 10:49.814
And cook a whole chicken,

10:49.816 --> 10:52.550
But since cos
really likes hot dogs...

10:52.552 --> 10:53.718
A gourmet, huh?

10:53.720 --> 10:55.053
Megan, be nice.

10:55.055 --> 10:56.388
I am always nice.

10:56.389 --> 10:57.722
New people aren't always
so bad, you know.

10:57.724 --> 11:01.326
I mean, sometimes change
can be a good thing
if you welcome it.

11:01.328 --> 11:04.229
Ugh!
You're not gonna call me
grasshopper now, are you?

11:04.231 --> 11:06.031
Where did you get
such a sharp tongue?

11:06.033 --> 11:08.066
You should hear
all the things I think

11:08.068 --> 11:09.968
And don't say.

11:09.970 --> 11:11.369
Honey, I got to say,

11:11.371 --> 11:13.204
It would mean a whole lot to me

11:13.206 --> 11:15.240
If you would at least try.

11:15.242 --> 11:17.809
Cosmo makes me
really happy,
you know, meg?

11:17.811 --> 11:19.511
And maybe you'll like him, too,

11:19.513 --> 11:21.079
If you give him a chance.

11:21.081 --> 11:23.014
You know what, mom,
you're right.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.650
I'll try. I really...
I really will.

11:25.652 --> 11:27.352
Thanks, sweetie.

11:27.354 --> 11:28.820
And maybe I'll think

11:28.822 --> 11:30.422
That he and ariel are great.

11:30.424 --> 11:31.356
If you like them,

11:31.358 --> 11:33.024
Then they must be great, right?

11:33.026 --> 11:35.560
Of course you also like
<i>lord of the dance,</i>

11:35.562 --> 11:37.562
But we won't go there.

11:38.665 --> 11:40.432
That'll be them.

11:40.434 --> 11:43.735
You want to get the door, meg?

11:43.737 --> 11:45.503
Sure.

11:49.910 --> 11:51.109
It's gonna be great.

11:51.111 --> 11:52.377
It's gonna be great.

11:52.379 --> 11:53.578
It's gonna be great.

11:53.580 --> 11:55.947
Please be great.

11:59.086 --> 12:00.919
Megan larson!

12:00.921 --> 12:03.254
Megan larson!

12:03.256 --> 12:04.305
Mom!

12:04.306 --> 12:05.355
You have no idea how happy I am

12:05.358 --> 12:06.691
To finally meet you.

12:06.693 --> 12:07.993
Are you cosmo?

12:07.994 --> 12:09.294
You should be
on a game show, megan.

12:09.296 --> 12:10.929
I like <i> hollywood squares,</i>
myself.

12:10.931 --> 12:13.098
Whoopi for the block!

12:14.101 --> 12:18.403
It was worse than I could
have possibly imagined,
diary.

12:19.473 --> 12:21.406
Are you a good alien...

12:21.408 --> 12:24.609
Or a bad alien?

12:26.446 --> 12:27.946
Good, mostly,

12:27.948 --> 12:30.415
But sometimes bad.

12:30.417 --> 12:33.451
Like now. Aah!

12:33.453 --> 12:35.386
Whoa!

12:35.388 --> 12:37.388
Ah, what's this?

12:39.326 --> 12:40.558
I love dogs.

12:40.560 --> 12:41.459
Such tiny brains

12:41.461 --> 12:43.795
In such large, powerful bodies.

12:43.797 --> 12:44.797
Cosmo.

12:44.798 --> 12:46.364
Kathy!

12:48.435 --> 12:50.735
I'm so happy to see you.

12:50.737 --> 12:52.237
Me, too.

12:52.239 --> 12:53.271
Ah, I have gas...

12:53.273 --> 12:54.672
Uh, I mean, root beer.

12:54.674 --> 12:56.141
These are for you.

12:56.143 --> 12:58.009
Thank you, cosmo.

12:58.011 --> 13:00.278
Uh, where's ariel?

13:00.280 --> 13:01.280
Uh, she's out in the car.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.314
She doesn't like the wind.

13:04.317 --> 13:07.619
She doesn't like the wind?

13:07.621 --> 13:10.789
Actually, wind can be
very frightening

13:10.791 --> 13:12.590
If you don't understand it.

13:12.592 --> 13:14.192
If you're an alien,

13:14.194 --> 13:16.828
The wind can just blow you away.

13:16.830 --> 13:18.329
Exactly. Right.

13:18.331 --> 13:20.532
Of course, wind can also be

13:20.534 --> 13:23.735
A wonderful way
of meeting people.

13:26.339 --> 13:30.008
Uh, you want to go
help her in, huh, meg?

13:30.010 --> 13:31.342
Mom!

13:31.344 --> 13:32.544
Megan.

13:32.546 --> 13:34.546
Ok.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.292
Hello?

13:47.294 --> 13:50.128
Ariel, hello?

14:21.895 --> 14:23.394
What are you doing under there?

14:23.396 --> 14:26.564
I fear the wind.

14:29.269 --> 14:30.269
Oh.

14:30.270 --> 14:31.936
Ariel: Dear diary,

14:31.938 --> 14:33.721
I cannot make sense

14:33.722 --> 14:35.505
Of this strange planet
called earth.

14:49.456 --> 14:52.390
Every time I look
at this horrid vehicle...

14:52.392 --> 14:54.025
The rubbery flesh,

14:54.027 --> 14:56.094
The flat face,

14:56.096 --> 14:57.996
The ghastly yellow hair

14:57.997 --> 14:59.897
That grows out
of this hideous skull...

14:59.900 --> 15:01.199
I can only think...

15:01.201 --> 15:03.301
I am grotesque.

15:03.303 --> 15:06.371
The same dream comes to me
most every night.

15:06.373 --> 15:09.641
I am back on my home planet
of zircalon.

15:09.643 --> 15:10.441
I am, once again,

15:10.443 --> 15:12.710
A beautiful pink ball of gas,

15:12.712 --> 15:15.947
Floating next
to my beloved fanul.

15:20.787 --> 15:23.755
Oh, fine, handsome,

15:23.757 --> 15:25.490
Intelligent fanul.

15:25.492 --> 15:27.992
How I miss floating with you.

15:27.994 --> 15:30.328
I miss my true self,

15:30.330 --> 15:31.330
My essence.

15:31.331 --> 15:32.497
How I long to be

15:32.499 --> 15:35.934
Zuezav of zircalon once again.

15:35.936 --> 15:38.436
And mother and father
are there as well,

15:38.438 --> 15:40.838
Floating by my side.

15:40.840 --> 15:42.407
Oh, the joy...

15:42.409 --> 15:44.008
The rapture...

15:44.010 --> 15:45.677
The bliss.

15:45.679 --> 15:49.781
I knew that we were
going to have to leave
zircalon, diary.

15:49.783 --> 15:52.250
I knew that daddy's life
was in danger

15:52.252 --> 15:55.186
Because he was
a freedom fighter.

15:56.690 --> 15:58.056
I knew, as well,

15:58.057 --> 15:59.423
That s'vad was
a repressive emperor,

15:59.426 --> 16:03.761
And that we were not
completely free on zircalon.

16:05.465 --> 16:08.199
Still, I never expected
to have to leave

16:08.201 --> 16:10.501
So suddenly, diary.

16:11.671 --> 16:15.707
It all happened
so incredibly fast.

16:31.791 --> 16:34.292
And in that one brief moment,

16:34.294 --> 16:35.994
My mother was lost forever...

16:38.231 --> 16:40.465
Now just a part
of the great cosmic gas.

16:54.647 --> 16:55.747
Strangely, diary,

16:55.749 --> 16:58.483
With all its horrors
and bizarre customs,

16:58.485 --> 17:00.985
Earth seems to posses
a wonderful abundance

17:00.987 --> 17:02.987
Of the one substance
we zircalonians

17:02.989 --> 17:04.555
Need to survive...

17:04.557 --> 17:07.925
The element known as co2.

17:07.926 --> 17:10.395
At least I still have gas.

17:14.334 --> 17:16.166
Monstrosity.

17:16.169 --> 17:18.368
I became desperate, diary.

17:18.371 --> 17:19.404
Desperate for any help

17:19.406 --> 17:22.507
In navigating this strange
and frightening place.

17:22.509 --> 17:24.709
That is when I turned
to our neighbor,

17:24.711 --> 17:26.676
The spiritual guide, serena soo.

17:27.881 --> 17:29.580
Off, gandhi.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.482
Away, picasso.

17:33.053 --> 17:35.853
Ariel, I know what troubles you.

17:35.855 --> 17:37.522
You do?

17:37.524 --> 17:42.460
In the month since you
and your charming father
have moved in,

17:42.462 --> 17:45.730
I've perceived
that you are different.

17:45.732 --> 17:46.597
Yes.

17:46.599 --> 17:49.934
You don't feel
that you belong here.

17:49.936 --> 17:51.202
No.

17:51.203 --> 17:52.469
And in this you are correct.

17:52.472 --> 17:53.371
You have lived

17:53.373 --> 17:56.274
Many, many times before, ariel.

17:56.276 --> 17:58.443
Most recently you were a cowhand

17:58.445 --> 18:01.279
On a large ranch in montana.

18:01.281 --> 18:02.413
You were crushed by a cow.

18:02.415 --> 18:06.050
You have not yet
psychically recovered
from this.

18:06.052 --> 18:10.054
Do you feel the truth
of what I'm telling you?

18:10.056 --> 18:12.623
Don't speak.

18:12.625 --> 18:14.725
I am a psychic.

18:14.727 --> 18:18.129
I already know
what you are thinking.

18:20.182 --> 18:22.232
I can see very clearly exact...

18:24.437 --> 18:25.837
I tried to tell serena soo

18:25.839 --> 18:27.706
About the flying insect, diary,

18:27.707 --> 18:29.574
But, of course,
she could not read my mind.

18:29.576 --> 18:32.844
She is a ridiculous
and pathetic person.

18:32.846 --> 18:33.911
But she at least possesses

18:33.913 --> 18:36.447
A somewhat gaseous manner.

18:36.449 --> 18:39.584
But what does any of it
matter now, diary?

18:39.586 --> 18:41.986
Now that dreariness and dread

18:41.988 --> 18:45.356
Have so utterly engulfed
my life.

18:49.095 --> 18:50.528
There.
What do you think?

18:50.530 --> 18:52.597
I hate it here, daddy.

18:52.599 --> 18:55.466
Everything here is so ugly

18:55.468 --> 18:58.503
And solid and heavy.

19:00.373 --> 19:03.040
I know it's hard, ariel.

19:03.042 --> 19:05.843
I miss our home, too.

19:05.845 --> 19:07.612
There was truly nothing

19:07.614 --> 19:10.515
Like a great day of floating...

19:10.517 --> 19:13.117
Expanding in the heat...

19:13.119 --> 19:15.953
Contracting when it cools off.

19:16.623 --> 19:18.723
Why can't we just go back, then?

19:18.725 --> 19:20.158
We'd be near mommy.

19:20.160 --> 19:22.293
Mommy has, uh...

19:22.295 --> 19:25.062
Thinned out a little, ariel.

19:25.064 --> 19:27.064
Besides, I'd be
imprisoned forever

19:27.066 --> 19:29.300
In a frozen cube.

19:29.302 --> 19:32.537
We came here to escape,
to be free.

19:32.539 --> 19:34.005
Free to be hideous.

19:34.007 --> 19:35.790
Oh, life on earth

19:35.791 --> 19:37.574
Is full of wondrous
possibilities, ariel.

19:37.577 --> 19:41.412
One can do or be
whatever one wants here.

19:41.414 --> 19:42.813
Look.

19:43.883 --> 19:45.716
This is a dummy.

19:45.718 --> 19:46.984
An artificial human

19:46.986 --> 19:47.919
That one can speak through.

19:47.921 --> 19:49.387
Hello, ariel.

19:49.389 --> 19:51.322
How can one not love a world

19:51.324 --> 19:53.824
In which such a thing exists?

19:57.564 --> 20:00.765
You are completely
imbalanced, daddy.

20:02.068 --> 20:04.168
And these names
you have given us:

20:04.170 --> 20:06.270
Ariel and cosmo cola.

20:06.272 --> 20:08.239
Ridiculous, pathetic.

20:12.078 --> 20:13.444
And these earthlings...
They pay money

20:13.446 --> 20:15.913
For these worthless solids
we brought with us.

20:15.915 --> 20:18.449
They're quite valuable here.

20:23.423 --> 20:26.290
I miss fanul so terribly, daddy.

20:26.292 --> 20:28.192
Please, may I
communicate with him?

20:28.194 --> 20:32.063
He would not betray me.
I know that he would not.

20:32.065 --> 20:35.433
Fanul is the son
of the emperor s'vad.

20:35.435 --> 20:37.602
You are my daughter.

20:37.604 --> 20:39.103
It is not possible.

20:39.105 --> 20:40.371
But, daddy...

20:40.373 --> 20:42.773
I'm sorry, ariel.

20:50.817 --> 20:53.585
Ahh.

20:53.586 --> 20:56.354
Look what
a beautiful day it is,
ariel.

20:57.624 --> 21:00.825
Being solid is invigorating.

21:00.827 --> 21:02.493
Ahh!

21:02.495 --> 21:05.496
Life on earth is fun, ariel.

21:05.498 --> 21:08.065
I only hope someday
you'll feel the same.

21:08.067 --> 21:10.067
What could be
less fun than this?

21:10.069 --> 21:11.969
I want my boyfriend back, daddy.

21:11.971 --> 21:14.805
I want to see fanul,
and I want to go ho...

21:14.807 --> 21:18.075
The wind. The wind!

21:19.412 --> 21:21.979
It can't hurt us,
ariel. It...

21:24.417 --> 21:25.783
I'm coming apart.

21:25.785 --> 21:28.853
I'm really coming apart.

21:33.126 --> 21:35.426
We fear the wind.

21:44.437 --> 21:45.720
Fanul, fanul,

21:45.721 --> 21:47.004
Why must you be
the son of the emperor,

21:47.006 --> 21:48.973
And I the freedom fighter's
daughter?

21:48.975 --> 21:52.143
We're just like the tragic story

21:52.145 --> 21:53.210
Of glaba and grokno,

21:53.212 --> 21:56.213
The 2 star-crossed
bubbles.

21:58.718 --> 22:00.117
But we will meet again, fanul,

22:00.119 --> 22:02.119
For I will come home to you.

22:03.990 --> 22:05.923
Until I do,

22:05.924 --> 22:07.857
I must try to hold on
to the beauty and majesty

22:07.860 --> 22:10.194
Of my zircalonian heritage.

22:10.196 --> 22:13.130
Perhaps that will keep me going.

22:13.132 --> 22:15.733
 Zircalon, zircalon 

22:15.735 --> 22:18.469
 bubbles dance
'cross the moon 

22:18.471 --> 22:21.505
 zircalon, zircalon 

22:21.507 --> 22:26.744
 make us free,
will you soon? 

22:27.980 --> 22:30.548
The wind was
blowing her about, ariel.

22:33.820 --> 22:35.086
I knew I had to save her,

22:35.088 --> 22:37.822
So I jumped in,

22:37.824 --> 22:39.423
But when I reached her,

22:39.425 --> 22:40.825
She wasn't frightened at all.

22:40.827 --> 22:43.361
I saw you being
blown about by the wind.

22:43.363 --> 22:44.929
I'm windsurfing.

22:44.931 --> 22:47.231
She's the most
remarkable creature.

22:47.233 --> 22:50.368
Kathy larson?

22:50.370 --> 22:51.370
The most...

22:51.371 --> 22:54.338
Lovely, intelligent...

22:54.340 --> 22:56.774
wonderful human
on the planet, ariel.

22:56.776 --> 22:58.776
But it's unthinkable.

22:58.778 --> 23:00.945
Mommy.

23:09.589 --> 23:13.391
Your mother was
an extraordinary bubble,
ariel.

23:13.393 --> 23:16.060
And I will never forget her.

23:16.062 --> 23:17.695
We had many wonderful
memories together,

23:17.697 --> 23:21.031
And I will always
cherish those memories.

23:21.033 --> 23:22.033
Just as I will always

23:22.034 --> 23:25.102
Cherish seeing
your mother in you.

23:26.372 --> 23:29.373
But we live here now.

23:29.976 --> 23:34.478
And I think we need
to make a life here.

23:34.480 --> 23:35.379
We're humans now, ariel.

23:35.381 --> 23:37.047
We need to live
with other humans.

23:37.049 --> 23:39.917
I don't think mommy
would want us

23:39.919 --> 23:41.485
To be alone and unhappy.

23:41.487 --> 23:44.054
Do you?

24:07.346 --> 24:08.646
Tonight's the night, ariel.

24:08.648 --> 24:10.514
We visit kathy and her children

24:10.516 --> 24:11.916
At their home.

24:11.918 --> 24:13.918
You're going to have
a wonderful time.

24:13.920 --> 24:15.753
I guarantee it.

24:15.754 --> 24:17.587
But I didn't have
a wonderful time, diary.

24:17.590 --> 24:20.157
In fact, the evening
was a hideous torture

24:20.159 --> 24:22.426
Right from the very start.

24:24.297 --> 24:27.164
I fear the wind.

24:28.668 --> 24:29.767
Ok.

24:29.769 --> 24:32.369
Well, it's pretty much stopped,

24:32.371 --> 24:35.172
So, like, you want to come out?

24:37.109 --> 24:41.612
No, no. Oh, no!
Oh, no! I'm...

24:48.487 --> 24:50.621
Don't threaten me, monster.

24:50.623 --> 24:51.889
He's just barking.

24:51.891 --> 24:53.457
Silence, beast.

24:54.893 --> 24:56.326
Your voice is loud and vulgar.

24:57.230 --> 24:59.730
You're an alien, too,
aren't you?

25:02.068 --> 25:04.902
I need water.

25:11.143 --> 25:13.344
Is she all right, cos?

25:13.346 --> 25:16.213
She's just nervous.

25:16.215 --> 25:18.916
Can you go
and check on her, meg?

25:18.918 --> 25:21.919
Sure. Why not?

25:26.325 --> 25:29.894
Ariel, are you ok?

25:37.770 --> 25:39.770
You're all wet.

25:41.440 --> 25:44.041
I fell in the sink.

25:44.043 --> 25:46.277
In the sink?

25:47.613 --> 25:50.147
Do you want to dry off?

25:59.292 --> 26:02.893
Your room is
hideously cluttered.

26:02.895 --> 26:04.428
Thank you.

26:04.430 --> 26:06.697
You can wear these.

26:09.302 --> 26:11.702
They're far too large.

26:13.306 --> 26:15.957
You can wear hers

26:15.958 --> 26:18.609
If you think that they
would fit you better.

26:20.279 --> 26:22.379
I will endure those.

26:30.990 --> 26:34.892
Did you just drink
that whole bottle?

26:34.894 --> 26:35.960
No.

26:35.962 --> 26:36.727
Yes, you did.

26:36.729 --> 26:38.162
Why is your voice like that?

26:38.164 --> 26:40.397
Are you trying to be
funny or something?

26:40.399 --> 26:42.566
Yes, I'm trying to be funny.

26:42.568 --> 26:43.601
Ha ha ha ha ha.

26:43.603 --> 26:45.769
Ha... Ha. Ahem.

26:45.771 --> 26:48.405
I am funny.

26:48.407 --> 26:49.773
You're freaking me out.

26:49.775 --> 26:51.175
Here, use this.

26:51.177 --> 26:52.276
Stop the wind.
Stop the wind!

26:52.278 --> 26:54.445
You are incredibly neurotic

26:54.447 --> 26:56.981
About your hair, you know that?

26:58.317 --> 26:59.817
Everything ok back here?

26:59.819 --> 27:02.953
Everything is very ok,
kathy larson, thank you.

27:02.955 --> 27:05.322
Great. Dinner's ready

27:06.592 --> 27:08.192
She seems nice, doesn't she?

27:08.194 --> 27:10.561
I'll take the fifth.

27:33.452 --> 27:35.152
I love food.

27:35.154 --> 27:36.520
Me, too!

27:36.522 --> 27:39.790
Don't you like hot dogs, ariel?

27:39.792 --> 27:42.026
I do not like food.

27:42.028 --> 27:43.694
Nothing?

27:43.696 --> 27:44.895
Grilled cheese...

27:44.897 --> 27:46.330
P.B. And j...

27:46.332 --> 27:48.766
Pasta?

27:50.236 --> 27:51.368
Food is messy.

27:51.370 --> 27:55.039
Yeah, mom, um, ariel's on
that new root beer diet.

27:55.041 --> 27:56.340
At that moment, diary,

27:56.342 --> 27:58.842
I knew that the creature
called megan larson

27:58.844 --> 28:00.644
Was to be feared and despised.

28:00.646 --> 28:02.646
At least I was
prepared for her now.

28:02.648 --> 28:04.314
What happened next, however,

28:04.316 --> 28:06.917
Was a shocking
and ghastly surprise.

28:06.919 --> 28:08.486
Cosmo: Kids.

28:08.487 --> 28:10.054
Kathy and I have something
we'd like to tell you.

28:10.056 --> 28:12.523
Megan... Trev...

28:12.525 --> 28:14.942
Ariel...

28:14.943 --> 28:17.360
Cosmo and I know
we both come from
very different worlds.

28:17.363 --> 28:18.696
And that we haven't
known each other

28:18.698 --> 28:19.563
For very long.

28:19.565 --> 28:21.098
And, well,
you can also understand

28:21.100 --> 28:24.268
That, well,
this dinner hasn't gone

28:24.270 --> 28:26.437
Exactly as smoothly

28:26.439 --> 28:27.938
As we would have all liked.

28:27.940 --> 28:29.406
But when 2 beings...

28:29.408 --> 28:32.443
Uh, people feel about each other

28:32.445 --> 28:34.011
The way we do...

28:34.012 --> 28:35.578
Well, we just have
to follow our hearts,

28:35.581 --> 28:40.451
And even though
this might seem
really sudden...

28:43.355 --> 28:46.356
Congratulate us, kids.
We're engaged.

28:49.695 --> 28:51.862
Do you want
to say anything, megan?

28:51.864 --> 28:55.365
I was speechless
when mom asked me that,

28:55.367 --> 28:56.867
But, diary,

28:56.869 --> 28:59.203
I definitely wasn't
speechless later.

28:59.205 --> 29:01.905
Mother, he is
the freak of all time.

29:01.907 --> 29:02.973
Oh, megan.

29:02.975 --> 29:04.725
He is.

29:04.726 --> 29:06.476
He's loud and bizarre,
and he dresses weird.

29:06.479 --> 29:08.378
It's like he's some insane clown

29:08.380 --> 29:09.613
Or something.

29:09.615 --> 29:10.447
I like him.

29:10.449 --> 29:11.482
I'm pretty sure he's an alien,

29:11.484 --> 29:13.050
But I think he's a good one.

29:13.052 --> 29:14.818
He can share my room
if he wants.

29:14.820 --> 29:16.887
He's not gonna be
your new playmate, trev.

29:16.889 --> 29:18.622
He's gonna be your new father.

29:18.624 --> 29:19.490
Stepfather, megan,

29:19.492 --> 29:21.592
And ariel will be
your stepsister.

29:21.594 --> 29:23.560
Let's not even go there.

29:23.562 --> 29:24.928
Ariel's nice.

29:24.930 --> 29:26.463
She's whacked, mother!

29:26.465 --> 29:28.298
I fell in the sink?!

29:28.300 --> 29:29.433
Well, maybe she meant the bath.

29:29.435 --> 29:31.802
Oh, and that thing
with the hair dryer.

29:31.804 --> 29:32.736
What was that?

29:32.738 --> 29:34.738
I think she's pretty.

29:34.740 --> 29:35.973
Yeah, well, you're 7, trev.

29:35.975 --> 29:38.542
You don't know anything.

29:39.345 --> 29:41.245
Oh, and the affected way
she talks.

29:41.247 --> 29:43.447
Oh, horror! Oh, misery!

29:43.449 --> 29:45.949
It's like she's
in some bad play.

29:45.951 --> 29:47.317
I think you're being silly.

29:47.319 --> 29:49.520
No, no, no,
I think I'm being smart.

29:49.522 --> 29:51.989
Mom, you're being silly.

29:51.991 --> 29:54.291
Meg, I would never marry anyone

29:54.293 --> 29:56.360
That you absolutely hated,

29:56.362 --> 29:57.694
But I got to tell you,

29:57.696 --> 30:00.631
Cos and I are
very happy together.

30:00.633 --> 30:03.700
I think this might be
the real thing,

30:03.702 --> 30:06.670
So I wish you'd at least
give him a chance,

30:06.672 --> 30:08.872
And try to get along
with ariel, too.

30:08.874 --> 30:10.507
Mom, I tried.

30:10.509 --> 30:12.009
She is scary.

30:12.011 --> 30:14.778
Well, I hear she likes to sing.

30:14.780 --> 30:18.515
Maybe you could
make music together.

30:18.517 --> 30:20.684
Fine. Forget that.

30:20.686 --> 30:22.820
Ariel's in a new place, megan.

30:22.822 --> 30:25.022
She's a long way from home...

30:25.024 --> 30:27.558
Millions of light years,
probably.

30:27.560 --> 30:30.794
Trev! Uh-uh.

30:33.833 --> 30:36.133
She lost her mom
a few years back,

30:36.135 --> 30:37.334
Did you know that?

30:37.336 --> 30:39.503
She did?

30:39.505 --> 30:41.305
So far from home,

30:41.307 --> 30:43.040
She hasn't had it easy.

30:43.042 --> 30:45.742
Give her a break, huh, meg?

30:48.480 --> 30:50.080
Great.

30:50.983 --> 30:54.084
She starts school
with you tomorrow.

31:04.163 --> 31:05.729
Didn't you have bikes
in the yukon?

31:05.731 --> 31:09.466
Of course. I am simply
out of practice.

31:34.226 --> 31:35.909
Crowd: Oh!

31:35.910 --> 31:37.593
Megan: Dear diary,
can you spell "mortifying?"

31:37.596 --> 31:39.563
I just knew what
everybody was thinking:

31:39.565 --> 31:42.633
"who's that dweeb with megan?
Is that megan's friend?

31:42.635 --> 31:45.736
And if so,
megan must be a dweeb, too."

31:45.738 --> 31:47.905
But then
the weirdest thing happened.

31:47.907 --> 31:50.240
Can't you make yourself
turn invisible?

31:50.242 --> 31:52.442
Possibly.
Should I try?

31:52.444 --> 31:54.378
Too late.

31:54.380 --> 31:55.546
Hey, guys.

31:55.547 --> 31:56.713
Hey, megan.
Who's your friend?

31:56.715 --> 31:57.948
Um, this is ariel.

31:57.950 --> 32:01.051
She's not really my friend.

32:01.720 --> 32:04.388
How do you guys know each other?

32:04.390 --> 32:05.289
Through our parents.

32:05.291 --> 32:07.090
Ariel's from the yukon.

32:07.092 --> 32:10.294
Oh, the yukon.
Cool!

32:10.296 --> 32:11.561
So, like, ariel,

32:11.563 --> 32:13.130
Do you like skiing?

32:13.132 --> 32:14.965
I like bubbles, and I like gas,

32:14.967 --> 32:16.667
And I am calmed by water.

32:16.669 --> 32:17.467
Matt: Cool.

32:17.469 --> 32:19.436
Can't argue with any of those.

32:19.438 --> 32:22.139
I don't get this.

32:23.808 --> 32:25.474
Hello, it's 'cause
she's gorgeous.

32:27.613 --> 32:28.512
She is not!

32:28.514 --> 32:30.447
Just because
you don't want her to be

32:30.449 --> 32:33.250
Doesn't mean she isn't, megan.

32:33.452 --> 32:35.452
I'd hate to have her
for a stepsister.

32:35.454 --> 32:38.455
You must feel <i> so</i> inferior.

32:38.457 --> 32:40.757
Inferior? To her?

32:40.759 --> 32:42.326
She's a total psycho!

32:42.328 --> 32:44.127
She can't even ride a bike

32:44.129 --> 32:45.796
<i>With</i> training wheels.

32:45.798 --> 32:50.167
Maybe she doesn't want to.
Maybe she's being subversive.

32:50.169 --> 32:51.635
Mikey, she fell on her face.

32:51.637 --> 32:53.770
How is that being subversive?

32:53.772 --> 32:55.305
The way she dresses.

32:55.307 --> 32:57.374
It's so original, so fresh.

32:57.376 --> 32:59.410
That is not original.

32:59.411 --> 33:01.445
My aunt ina's been
dressing like that
for years.

33:01.447 --> 33:03.046
And I'll tell you one thing.

33:03.048 --> 33:04.848
Cutter won't think she's cool.

33:04.850 --> 33:06.149
Cutter thinks I'm cool.

33:06.151 --> 33:11.521
Megan, as your friend,
that's really pathetic.

33:11.957 --> 33:14.358
I'm gonna go talk to her.

33:14.360 --> 33:16.560
Why?

33:16.561 --> 33:18.761
I think she might be,
like, a visionary.

33:19.298 --> 33:22.399
So, ariel, how come
you wear so many layers?

33:22.401 --> 33:24.701
I'm trying
to protect my essence.

33:24.703 --> 33:26.336
That's intense!

33:26.338 --> 33:27.738
I can't believe this!

33:27.740 --> 33:29.573
Matt: Essences
unprotected sometimes.

33:34.246 --> 33:38.548
And what is the volume
of the swimming pool?

33:38.550 --> 33:39.850
Mr. Singh: Megan?

33:39.852 --> 33:40.484
Huh?

33:40.486 --> 33:43.487
The volume of the pool.

33:43.489 --> 33:46.056
Oh, uh...

33:46.558 --> 33:48.592
Medium?

33:48.594 --> 33:51.828
Can anyone else
answer the question?

33:54.166 --> 33:55.599
Ariel.

33:55.600 --> 33:57.033
I assume that you
wish me to visualize

33:57.036 --> 33:59.669
The trapezoidal side
of the pool as the base,
mr. Singh?

33:59.671 --> 34:00.404
Uh...

34:00.406 --> 34:01.639
I assume also that

34:01.640 --> 34:02.873
The depth of the pool
is to be measured in meters

34:02.875 --> 34:05.142
And the fluid volume to be
measured in kiloliters.

34:05.144 --> 34:06.460
Well...

34:06.461 --> 34:07.777
Assuming that
these things are the case,

34:07.780 --> 34:08.678
And the water temperature

34:08.679 --> 34:11.081
Is no higher than
32 degrees centigrade,

34:11.083 --> 34:15.284
Then the answer
is 13.34 kiloliters.

34:15.286 --> 34:16.420
Mr. Singh:
That is correct.

34:16.422 --> 34:21.091
Ariel is the full-on
good will hunting.

34:23.362 --> 34:26.196
I hear her iq is, like, 300.

34:26.197 --> 34:28.297
I hear she dated prince william.

34:28.300 --> 34:30.567
Well, I hear
she tutored bill gates.

34:30.569 --> 34:32.436
They don't understand, michelle.

34:32.438 --> 34:34.905
Ariel is not
any of those things.

34:34.907 --> 34:36.406
She's like...

34:36.408 --> 34:38.275
An alien from another planet.

34:38.277 --> 34:40.444
Yeah, from the planet rad.

34:40.446 --> 34:43.480
No, from the planet weird.

34:43.482 --> 34:45.748
She fears wind, michelle.

34:45.751 --> 34:48.284
Well, wind is scary...

34:48.286 --> 34:50.286
In a way.

34:50.288 --> 34:52.288
I cannot believe
you just said that.

34:52.291 --> 34:54.424
Unbelievable!
Her first day,

34:54.426 --> 34:57.761
And she's already
sitting at the popular table.

34:57.763 --> 34:59.396
Heather: Megan!

34:59.398 --> 35:00.430
Megan!

35:00.432 --> 35:03.400
Heather hartman's calling you.

35:03.402 --> 35:05.001
Go.

35:05.404 --> 35:07.003
Go!

35:08.006 --> 35:10.740
I love the way you protect
your essence, ariel.

35:10.742 --> 35:12.342
Definitely.

35:12.343 --> 35:13.943
And you totally tore
the cover off how, like,

35:13.946 --> 35:15.645
Mundane bike riding is.

35:15.647 --> 35:18.815
Ariel says you two are gonna
be stepsisters, megan.

35:18.817 --> 35:21.418
Well, that's not really
a sure thing, heather.

35:21.420 --> 35:23.487
You are so lucky.

35:23.489 --> 35:27.324
I just think that ariel
is such the total package.

35:27.326 --> 35:30.327
She's wise and deep and mature.

35:30.329 --> 35:34.531
Plus, she has
incredibly strong hair.

35:35.134 --> 35:38.135
Do you know what kind
of conditioner she uses, megan?

35:38.137 --> 35:40.871
As far as I know,
she just falls in the sink.

35:40.873 --> 35:45.575
Falls in the sink.
I should try that.

35:45.777 --> 35:49.813
You can sit at our table
tomorrow, too, megan...

35:49.815 --> 35:52.349
If you want.

35:52.351 --> 35:54.551
Thanks, your majesty.

35:54.553 --> 35:57.187
Wonder if there are
any sinks around here

35:57.189 --> 35:59.322
I could fall into.

35:59.324 --> 36:02.692
You are such a revolutionary!

36:03.829 --> 36:06.897
This is nauseating.

36:14.139 --> 36:18.475
She's, like, totally
channeling alfred einstein.

36:18.477 --> 36:20.010
It's albert.

36:20.012 --> 36:22.546
Chill, megan.

36:22.881 --> 36:25.382
 Oh-oh-oh 

36:25.384 --> 36:31.087
 zircalon 

36:31.089 --> 36:32.822
 oh-oh-oh 

36:32.824 --> 36:34.224
This is lame!

36:34.226 --> 36:37.861
 Oh-oh-oh 

37:00.385 --> 37:01.918
Oh, fanul.

37:01.920 --> 37:04.421
How I miss you,
my darling fanul.

37:04.423 --> 37:08.425
Are you talking
to that bubble, ariel?

37:08.427 --> 37:12.395
That <i> bubble,</i> as you
so patronizingly call it,

37:12.397 --> 37:15.165
Is the love of my life!

37:18.070 --> 37:20.470
What a poet she is.

37:20.472 --> 37:22.372
She is not a poet!

37:22.374 --> 37:24.708
She's possessed!

37:25.210 --> 37:27.377
Yeah, I know.

37:27.379 --> 37:29.312
Get to class.

37:29.314 --> 37:32.449
Girl: My essence
is so fragile!

37:37.322 --> 37:40.991
Megan: It was becoming
a nightmare of biblical
proportions, diary.

37:40.993 --> 37:43.593
By seventh period,
ariel could've
set her hair on fire

37:43.595 --> 37:45.428
And run around flapping
her arms like a chicken,

37:45.430 --> 37:48.465
And people would've
thought it was cool.

37:48.467 --> 37:50.300
Actually, that <i> would've</i>
been kinda cool,

37:50.302 --> 37:52.502
But you get the idea, diary.

37:52.504 --> 37:54.404
But the worst part was

37:54.406 --> 37:56.506
That the worst part
was yet to come.

37:56.508 --> 37:59.342
Mom, I don't want
to teach ariel
how to windsurf.

37:59.344 --> 38:01.311
It's something
you guys can share, megan.

38:01.313 --> 38:02.912
I don't want to share with her.

38:02.914 --> 38:03.813
Megan!
Mom!

38:03.815 --> 38:05.348
Megan!
Mom!

38:05.350 --> 38:06.800
Megan!

38:06.801 --> 38:08.251
This could go on
for hours, you know.

38:08.253 --> 38:10.487
Can't you try a bit more, honey?

38:10.489 --> 38:12.355
But, mom, cutter might be there.

38:12.357 --> 38:15.258
And ariel... she's
terrified of the wind.

38:15.260 --> 38:18.161
How's she gonna learn
how to windsurf?

38:18.163 --> 38:20.463
She just needs to get past that.

38:20.465 --> 38:23.667
I don't think you're
being very mature, meg.

38:23.669 --> 38:25.702
I'm not?
Mom, you're the one

38:25.704 --> 38:27.304
Who's marrying
a complete stranger.

38:27.306 --> 38:29.439
Cos is not a stranger, meg.

38:29.441 --> 38:31.441
In fact, in some ways,

38:31.442 --> 38:33.442
I feel I know him better
than I've ever known any man.

38:33.445 --> 38:36.179
Do you know the term
"soulmates," honey?

38:36.181 --> 38:38.181
Mom. Ok,
I'll make you a deal.

38:38.183 --> 38:40.483
I promise to take ariel
out on the water

38:40.485 --> 38:43.720
If you promise never
to use that word again.

38:43.722 --> 38:46.189
Deal.

38:46.658 --> 38:48.158
I'm just gonna,
like, go out there,

38:48.160 --> 38:51.561
And you can copy
what I do afterward, ok?

38:52.397 --> 38:54.064
What?

38:54.800 --> 38:55.999
I fear the wind.

38:56.001 --> 39:01.571
Well, you're gonna
have to get past that.

39:16.722 --> 39:19.489
Megan:
And then it happened.

39:22.928 --> 39:24.361
Unh!

39:24.363 --> 39:28.732
From that moment on,
diary, it was war.

39:39.911 --> 39:41.645
Ariel: Dear diary,

39:41.646 --> 39:43.380
Just when I thought
it couldn't get any worse,

39:43.382 --> 39:47.250
I learned what the words
"high school" mean.

39:47.686 --> 39:50.220
Can't you make yourself
turn invisible?

39:50.222 --> 39:52.389
Possibly.
Should I try?

39:52.391 --> 39:54.124
Too late.

39:54.126 --> 39:54.891
Hey, guys.

39:54.893 --> 39:57.060
Hey, megan, who's your friend?

39:57.062 --> 39:58.561
Um, this is ariel.

39:58.563 --> 40:01.131
She's not really my friend.

40:01.133 --> 40:03.433
Ariel: At feeding time,
I was invited to sit

40:03.435 --> 40:05.435
At a certain table
which seems to possess

40:05.437 --> 40:07.370
Great importance to the humans.

40:07.372 --> 40:09.272
At this table the conversation

40:09.274 --> 40:11.408
Was pathetically empty
and meaningless.

40:11.410 --> 40:12.976
Everyone thinks you're, like,

40:12.978 --> 40:15.478
A total enigma, ariel.

40:15.480 --> 40:18.415
But I know what you <i> really</i> are.

40:18.417 --> 40:20.083
You do?

40:20.085 --> 40:23.820
You're a major cosmetics
representative, right?

40:25.323 --> 40:26.289
Megan!

40:26.291 --> 40:28.174
Megan!

40:28.175 --> 40:30.058
I love the way you
protect your essence, ariel.

40:30.061 --> 40:31.644
Definitely.

40:31.645 --> 40:33.228
And you totally tore
the cover off how, like,

40:33.231 --> 40:35.231
Mundane bike riding is.

40:35.233 --> 40:38.501
Ariel says you two are gonna
be stepsisters, megan.

40:38.503 --> 40:40.670
Well, that's
not really a sure thing.

40:40.672 --> 40:42.005
You are <i> so</i> lucky.

40:42.007 --> 40:46.843
I bet megan
is <i> so</i> jealous of you.

40:46.845 --> 40:49.245
I bet she wants
to be just like you.

40:49.247 --> 40:52.248
Why would anyone want that?

40:55.921 --> 40:58.254
You're both quite vacuous.

40:58.256 --> 40:59.489
Hideous!

40:59.491 --> 41:00.457
Monstrous!

41:00.459 --> 41:03.426
The yukon rules!

41:09.668 --> 41:13.136
Whoo!
That was cool, man!

41:13.138 --> 41:16.406
You are such a revolutionary!

41:18.310 --> 41:22.378
Well, you're gonna
have to get past that.

41:34.693 --> 41:38.528
Ariel: When we
got to the beach
this afternoon, diary,

41:38.530 --> 41:39.896
I'd had enough.

41:39.898 --> 41:41.364
I was afraid for myself, yes,

41:41.366 --> 41:45.001
But I was even more
frightened for megan larson.

41:45.003 --> 41:46.836
Would not the wind destroy her?

41:46.838 --> 41:49.138
Watching her blown about
on the water,

41:49.140 --> 41:53.476
I felt myself begin
to fall apart again.

42:08.193 --> 42:12.562
I was just about to go
rescue megan larson when...

42:13.865 --> 42:14.831
Hey!

42:14.833 --> 42:17.233
Ariel?

42:17.235 --> 42:19.802
I'm cutter.

42:26.711 --> 42:31.414
Do you know
your clothes are wet?

42:31.416 --> 42:34.417
I intended to rescue
megan larson.

42:34.419 --> 42:37.520
Oh. No, she's fine.

42:37.856 --> 42:40.190
What is your interest

42:40.191 --> 42:42.525
In this disgusting
bag of skin I inhabit, cutter?

42:42.527 --> 42:43.793
Whoa, whoa, whoa, ariel.

42:43.795 --> 42:45.028
That is way harsh.

42:45.030 --> 42:48.531
I mean,
I don't think
it's disgusting.

42:48.533 --> 42:51.634
I think it's very
un-disgusting,
in fact.

42:51.636 --> 42:55.705
That is because you
inhabit a bag of skin, too.

42:55.707 --> 42:57.407
Ok, I guess I do.

42:57.409 --> 42:58.575
What's the alternative?

42:58.577 --> 43:00.910
I wish to be gas.

43:00.912 --> 43:03.479
Pure gas.

43:03.481 --> 43:07.750
Heh, that's one weird ambition.

43:07.752 --> 43:09.786
So, like, uh...

43:10.655 --> 43:13.156
You want to be my girlfriend?

43:13.158 --> 43:14.824
I find you vapid
and shallow, cutter.

43:14.826 --> 43:17.760
All right. Hey,
maybe I am those things.

43:17.762 --> 43:20.463
You know,
shallow... definitely.

43:20.465 --> 43:23.399
Vapid... look, I don't
know what that means,

43:23.401 --> 43:25.568
But I'm sure if I did
I could be that, too,

43:25.570 --> 43:27.403
You know, but listen, right,

43:27.405 --> 43:31.674
Vapid, shallow people
have feelings, too, ok?

43:33.311 --> 43:34.744
Check it out!
It's a party!

43:34.746 --> 43:37.013
Hey, megan, how was your ride?

43:37.015 --> 43:39.983
Fine.
Come on, ariel.

43:39.985 --> 43:41.651
Ariel!

43:41.652 --> 43:43.318
Ariel: And now, diary,
as we say on zircalon...

43:43.321 --> 43:46.155
Bye, megan.
The clag
really hit the dron.

43:46.157 --> 43:47.724
See ya, ariel.

43:47.993 --> 43:52.295
I just want you to know
that I'm onto you, ariel.

43:52.297 --> 43:53.647
Onto me?

43:53.648 --> 43:54.998
You may think you're
fooling everybody else,

43:55.000 --> 43:56.599
But you are not fooling me.

43:56.601 --> 43:58.835
I see exactly what you're doing.

43:58.837 --> 44:00.503
I do not understand.

44:00.505 --> 44:02.171
Coming here
with your root beer jones

44:02.173 --> 44:03.506
And your affected way of talking

44:03.508 --> 44:07.310
And your whacked songs
and just, like, taking over.

44:07.312 --> 44:10.113
You misapprehend me,
evil megan larson.

44:10.115 --> 44:14.317
No. No, I think
I apprehend you
very well, ariel cola.

44:14.319 --> 44:16.886
You are like the total bad seed!

44:16.888 --> 44:18.721
Why do you wish my destruction,

44:18.723 --> 44:21.557
Evil megan larson?
Why?

44:22.494 --> 44:23.726
Because...

44:23.728 --> 44:25.862
Because you have come in,

44:25.864 --> 44:28.231
And you've taken
everything I want!

44:28.233 --> 44:30.233
Well, fine, have it.

44:30.235 --> 44:32.135
But leave cutter alone.

44:32.137 --> 44:34.470
I do not want cutter.

44:34.472 --> 44:35.638
I do not want any of it.

44:35.640 --> 44:39.308
All I want is to go home.

44:39.310 --> 44:41.344
What?

44:41.345 --> 44:43.379
I just want to go home.

44:43.381 --> 44:45.448
You do?

44:45.449 --> 44:47.516
I would give
anything to leave
this horrid place,

44:47.519 --> 44:50.586
With its
strange creatures
and its solid objects

44:50.588 --> 44:51.888
And its callous disregard

44:51.890 --> 44:53.322
For the natural
dignity of bubbles!

44:53.324 --> 44:57.360
You don't like us because
we're not nice to bubbles?

44:57.362 --> 45:00.563
I wish only to go home.

45:00.565 --> 45:02.632
To see fanul.

45:02.634 --> 45:03.900
To be gaseous.

45:03.902 --> 45:08.571
So you don't want
your dad to marry my mom?

45:08.573 --> 45:09.505
Of course not.

45:09.507 --> 45:10.940
Ariel: And so
in that moment, diary,

45:10.942 --> 45:13.676
A strange, unholy alliance
was born

45:13.678 --> 45:15.778
Between evil megan larson and I.

45:15.780 --> 45:18.781
When daddy and kathy larson
went out this evening,

45:18.783 --> 45:21.117
Evil megan larson
and I volunteered

45:21.119 --> 45:23.686
To watch the small noisemaker.

45:30.061 --> 45:32.128
Ok, trev, time for bed.

45:32.130 --> 45:34.697
But, megan,
it's not even 6:00 yet,

45:34.699 --> 45:37.667
And I haven't even had dinner.

45:39.137 --> 45:40.403
<i>Bon appetit!</i>

45:40.405 --> 45:41.738
Ah.

45:41.740 --> 45:44.874
Good night. Oh,
take roky with you.

45:44.876 --> 45:47.376
Ok, the first thing
we have to do

45:47.378 --> 45:48.311
Is convince our parents

45:48.313 --> 45:49.545
That we're the best of friends.

45:49.547 --> 45:51.414
I do not understand,
evil megan larson.

45:51.416 --> 45:54.117
How could 2 creatures who
dislike each other as we do

45:54.119 --> 45:55.418
Possibly convey otherwise?

45:55.420 --> 45:57.320
There's this thing
we have in the u.S.

45:57.322 --> 45:59.222
Maybe you've heard of it, ariel.

45:59.224 --> 46:02.692
It's called acting.

46:06.397 --> 46:09.098
Ariel: Megan larson
revealed herself that night

46:09.100 --> 46:11.167
As a truly evil architect.

46:11.169 --> 46:14.070
"all is fair in love
and war," she said.

46:14.072 --> 46:16.405
"sometimes the bubble
that shimmers brightest

46:16.407 --> 46:18.808
Ascends the slowest,"
I responded.

46:18.810 --> 46:20.843
Acting!

46:20.845 --> 46:22.145
She did not understand
the reference.

46:22.147 --> 46:23.579
 It's all right 

46:23.581 --> 46:26.082
 it's ok 

46:26.084 --> 46:30.286
 it's all right
just to be me 

46:30.288 --> 46:32.622
 it's solid or gas 

46:32.624 --> 46:35.291
 liquid or stone 

46:35.293 --> 46:37.493
 a friendship like ours 

46:37.495 --> 46:42.598
 you're never alone 

46:42.600 --> 46:44.634
that actually wasn't bad.

46:44.636 --> 46:46.803
I'm surprised to say
I liked it as well.

46:46.805 --> 46:50.373
We had an extremely
rad time together, daddy,

46:50.375 --> 46:51.641
And now we are
the best of friends.

46:51.643 --> 46:53.543
We can't <i> wait</i>
to be stepsisters, mom.

46:53.545 --> 46:56.045
Please sample
these extreme cookies
we made, daddy.

46:56.047 --> 46:58.447
And now that me
and ariel are so close,

46:58.449 --> 47:00.316
She told me the sweetest thing.

47:00.318 --> 47:02.151
Cos thinks that
you're the funnest,

47:02.153 --> 47:05.488
Most refreshingly simple
girl he's ever met,

47:05.490 --> 47:07.390
And all he ever talks about

47:07.392 --> 47:09.058
Is how light, frivolous,

47:09.060 --> 47:10.793
And insubstantial you are.

47:10.795 --> 47:12.829
In the best sense, of course.

47:12.831 --> 47:14.997
Isn't that sweet?

47:14.999 --> 47:16.165
Ha ha ha.

47:16.167 --> 47:20.503
Ariel: And so, our evil plan
began in earnest.

47:20.505 --> 47:21.904
Risotto,

47:21.906 --> 47:23.506
Roasted fennel,

47:23.508 --> 47:24.974
And warm pear salad.

47:24.976 --> 47:26.742
Enjoy!

47:32.750 --> 47:34.817
Kathy: "and his
flight from hiawatha

47:34.819 --> 47:37.587
"and his wondrous
transmigrations

47:37.589 --> 47:41.424
And the end
of his adventures."

47:41.426 --> 47:44.393
Now chapter 16.

47:44.395 --> 47:46.329
"on the shores of gitche gumee,

47:46.331 --> 47:48.898
"on the dunes of nagow wudjoo,

47:48.900 --> 47:51.500
"by the shining big sea water

47:51.502 --> 47:55.404
"stood the lodge
of pau-puk-keewis.

47:55.406 --> 47:57.373
"it was he who in his frenzy

47:57.375 --> 48:00.943
Whirled these
drifting sands..."

48:00.945 --> 48:03.446
Cosmo, what are you doing?

48:03.448 --> 48:05.514
It's a spider on the wall there.

48:05.516 --> 48:07.617
But I'm just
in the middle
of my poem.

48:07.619 --> 48:10.253
But it caught a bug,
kathy, look!

48:10.255 --> 48:12.155
Cosmo...

48:12.156 --> 48:14.056
Hey! Almost time
for <i> hollywood squares!</i>

48:14.058 --> 48:15.791
Pumbaa, I think
you're onto something.

48:15.793 --> 48:16.893
Pumbaa, farting:
I am?

48:16.895 --> 48:18.628
Timon: I'll say.
Being popular

48:18.630 --> 48:20.696
Is the best reason
to do anything.

48:20.698 --> 48:22.365
If you become an elephant,

48:22.367 --> 48:23.933
Everyone would love you,

48:23.935 --> 48:25.468
Then we can be...

48:25.470 --> 48:27.904
Are you making fun of me, cos?

48:27.906 --> 48:29.972
Of course not, kathy.

48:29.974 --> 48:32.375
I mean, if you think
I'm such an airhead,

48:32.377 --> 48:33.709
Why did you ask me to marry you?

48:33.711 --> 48:37.780
How can you ask such
a question, kathy?

48:37.782 --> 48:40.616
I love how fun and free you are,

48:40.618 --> 48:42.718
And I like the way you look.

48:42.720 --> 48:44.620
I'm fun and I'm free

48:44.622 --> 48:45.922
And I'm cute?

48:45.924 --> 48:48.324
What about my mind, cosmo?

48:48.326 --> 48:50.426
I've never seen
your mind, kathy.

48:50.428 --> 48:54.263
That is a very unkind
thing to say, cosmo cola.

48:54.265 --> 48:56.432
Why are you acting
like this, kathy?

48:56.434 --> 48:57.466
Like what?

48:57.468 --> 48:59.568
Like the shrill
and strident guest

48:59.570 --> 49:00.770
On a daytime tv show.

49:00.772 --> 49:02.338
Maybe it's because
you're acting like

49:02.340 --> 49:05.241
An inconsiderate snob, cosmo.

49:05.243 --> 49:07.977
I had no idea you could
be such a termagant.

49:07.979 --> 49:09.946
Terma-what?

49:09.948 --> 49:12.415
Termagant...
Loud, obnoxious woman.

49:12.417 --> 49:15.985
This date is over.

49:16.688 --> 49:18.354
Kathy!

49:18.690 --> 49:20.489
Kathy!

49:20.825 --> 49:22.491
Kathy!

49:27.665 --> 49:30.266
What are you two doing?

49:32.870 --> 49:34.570
Nothing.

49:35.106 --> 49:38.641
Ariel: Of course, as megan said,
one fight was not enough

49:38.643 --> 49:42.144
To end the relationship
entirely, diary.

49:42.146 --> 49:45.915
Thus, the next move was mine.

49:46.384 --> 49:47.350
As you know, daddy,

49:47.352 --> 49:49.819
Megan and I are now
the best of friends.

49:49.821 --> 49:53.155
We so long to be stepsisters.

49:53.157 --> 49:54.290
And in this spirit,

49:54.292 --> 49:57.360
She has shared
a confidence with me.

49:58.730 --> 49:59.495
Yes?

49:59.497 --> 50:01.030
You see, daddy,

50:01.032 --> 50:03.299
Kathy only acted the way she did

50:03.301 --> 50:05.167
Because she was
testing you, I told him.

50:05.169 --> 50:06.836
She knows that you can be fun,

50:06.838 --> 50:09.205
Like a big carefree
child, but she needs

50:09.207 --> 50:12.241
To know that you can
be a real man, daddy.

50:12.243 --> 50:13.175
And you're only telling him this

50:13.177 --> 50:15.644
'cause you want them
to be happy, right?

50:15.646 --> 50:17.930
Mm-hmm.

50:17.931 --> 50:20.215
Perfect. Let's go see
how it's working.

50:20.385 --> 50:22.485
You look great tonight,
little lady.

50:22.487 --> 50:24.820
Why do you
keep calling me
"little lady," cos?

50:24.822 --> 50:28.524
Don't you worry
your pretty little head
about that, ma'am.

50:28.526 --> 50:30.659
I'll take care of everything.

50:30.661 --> 50:32.545
Except on sundays,

50:32.546 --> 50:34.430
When I'll be watching
football on tv all day.

50:34.432 --> 50:36.699
What on earth are
you talking about?

50:36.701 --> 50:39.335
You looking at my woman, fella?

50:39.337 --> 50:40.870
Cos...

50:40.872 --> 50:42.338
No, sir.

50:42.340 --> 50:44.040
Well, don't.

50:44.042 --> 50:46.409
And fetch me a steak, son.

50:46.411 --> 50:47.843
Biggest one you got.

50:47.845 --> 50:49.445
Raw!

50:49.447 --> 50:51.781
We don't have steak, sir.

50:51.783 --> 50:52.882
Oh, you don't, do you?

50:52.884 --> 50:55.351
Well, this is
a pizza parlor, sir.

50:55.353 --> 50:56.786
Aha!

50:56.788 --> 50:59.105
Well, uh...

50:59.106 --> 51:01.423
Well, bring me
the manliest pizza you got!

51:05.563 --> 51:08.431
And put jelly beans on it!

51:09.367 --> 51:11.300
What's up with mom and cos?

51:11.302 --> 51:13.602
They're having
a grown-up talk.

51:13.604 --> 51:16.205
How come you guys
look so happy about it?

51:16.207 --> 51:19.308
Go play games, trev.

51:25.316 --> 51:26.816
Am I very strong, dummy?

51:26.818 --> 51:29.852
Yes, very.

51:31.389 --> 51:34.056
Am I dependable, dummy?

51:34.058 --> 51:36.525
Absolutely!

51:37.795 --> 51:40.229
Come on, little lady.
Let's dance!

51:40.231 --> 51:41.330
Cosmo!

51:41.332 --> 51:42.932
Oh! Oh!

51:42.934 --> 51:44.266
Cosmo: Ever been
swept off your feet

51:44.268 --> 51:45.668
By a man like this before?

51:45.670 --> 51:46.769
Whoo hoo!

51:46.771 --> 51:47.771
Cosmo!

51:51.476 --> 51:55.010
Here in the u.S. We have
a little term, ariel...

51:55.012 --> 51:57.847
"mission accomplished."

51:58.483 --> 52:02.952
In the yukon, we say,
"gaseous matter expanded."

52:02.954 --> 52:05.154
Right. Uh, well...

52:05.156 --> 52:07.690
Gaseous matter expanded, then.

52:07.692 --> 52:08.692
Your plan was wise, megan.

52:08.693 --> 52:12.328
I couldn't have done it
without you, ariel.

52:12.330 --> 52:14.930
Maybe I did misapprehend you.

52:14.932 --> 52:17.099
The whole cutter thing
notwithstanding.

52:17.101 --> 52:20.903
Maybe I misapprehended
you as well.

52:21.506 --> 52:23.372
Ariel:
This was strange, diary.

52:23.374 --> 52:24.673
Megan larson and I

52:24.675 --> 52:26.308
Were sharing
a pleasant conversation.

52:26.310 --> 52:29.512
We had just managed
to make our parents
hate each other,

52:29.514 --> 52:31.647
And now were we
starting to like,

52:31.649 --> 52:34.350
Or at least tolerate,
each other?

52:34.352 --> 52:35.818
I only acted that way

52:35.820 --> 52:38.787
Because I thought
you wanted me to.

52:38.789 --> 52:41.323
Y-you mean so much to me.

52:41.325 --> 52:45.161
And I thought you
wanted me to act
the way I did.

52:45.163 --> 52:47.196
Who said <i> that?</i>

52:52.737 --> 52:54.170
Incoming looks.

52:54.172 --> 52:55.705
This is very not good.

52:55.706 --> 52:57.239
Megan:
Well, I thought that
if cosmo were like that,

52:57.241 --> 52:58.908
And you were, you know,
more like this,

52:58.910 --> 53:01.577
Then we could all be
more... Something else.

53:01.579 --> 53:03.546
That is the most
ridiculous answer

53:03.548 --> 53:05.347
I've ever heard, megan.

53:05.349 --> 53:06.966
Give me a few minutes.

53:06.967 --> 53:08.584
I could make it
sound more convincing.

53:09.053 --> 53:11.086
Ariel?

53:13.558 --> 53:15.824
Oh, shame and ignominy!

53:15.826 --> 53:18.260
I have disgraced
myself and my family

53:18.262 --> 53:20.396
All for my own selfish reasons.

53:20.398 --> 53:22.998
No, ariel, ariel, don't cry.

53:23.000 --> 53:24.567
We know this isn't easy.

53:24.569 --> 53:26.735
We understand, don't we, cos?

53:26.737 --> 53:28.637
Of course we do.

53:29.440 --> 53:33.609
I guess it's not easy
being an alien.

53:41.519 --> 53:44.386
I can endure this no longer.

53:44.388 --> 53:48.023
I'm sorry, father.

53:50.928 --> 53:51.928
My darling fanul,

53:51.929 --> 53:55.965
Please come save me
from this horrid place.

53:55.967 --> 53:58.534
I wait for you expectantly.

53:58.536 --> 54:00.970
Yours, saweeza.

54:01.472 --> 54:03.572
P.S. Whatever you do, fanul,

54:03.574 --> 54:05.140
You must not tell your father,

54:05.142 --> 54:08.177
The emperor s'vad, where we are.

54:19.624 --> 54:22.424
Megan: Plan "a" went
totally belly up, diary,

54:22.426 --> 54:25.227
But I definitely
have a plan "b."

54:25.229 --> 54:27.129
Sometimes I wonder for a second

54:27.131 --> 54:29.565
If I'm doing
the right thing here.

54:29.567 --> 54:32.568
I mean, cos is
a complete freak of nature,

54:32.570 --> 54:33.669
But he kinda grows on you.

54:33.671 --> 54:37.306
And ariel, well, I mean,
is it really her fault

54:37.308 --> 54:40.442
That everybody mistakes
her weirdness for coolness?

54:40.444 --> 54:42.344
But still...

54:42.346 --> 54:45.247
Megan: All we have
to do is make 'em fall
for somebody else.

54:45.249 --> 54:48.951
Like, my mom
is still totally
in love with my dad.

54:48.953 --> 54:50.486
Well, not love exactly.

54:50.488 --> 54:53.656
Actually, they don't
even seem to really
like each other much,

54:53.658 --> 54:55.491
But they were married
for 10 years.

54:55.493 --> 54:56.692
Plus, they had me
and trev together.

54:56.694 --> 54:59.795
So that is what ended
their relationship?

54:59.797 --> 55:00.763
Horrid!

55:00.765 --> 55:01.930
Appalling.

55:01.932 --> 55:03.165
Grotesque.

55:03.167 --> 55:04.667
Dreadful.

55:04.669 --> 55:06.102
Loser!

55:06.103 --> 55:07.536
What about your dad?
Is there anybody

55:07.538 --> 55:09.838
You've met who's even
sort of like your mom?

55:09.840 --> 55:13.142
Well, in fact,
your mother, kathy larson,

55:13.144 --> 55:14.510
Has a warmth
and pleasantness to her

55:14.512 --> 55:16.879
That are reminiscent
of my mother.

55:16.881 --> 55:18.714
In that sense,
I can see why my father

55:18.716 --> 55:21.450
Enjoys her company
and is cheered by her.

55:21.452 --> 55:23.218
For that matter, my mom seems

55:23.220 --> 55:24.486
To get along
better with your dad

55:24.488 --> 55:25.454
Than she ever did with mine.

55:25.456 --> 55:27.890
I mean, they do
laugh a lot more.

55:27.892 --> 55:28.657
Yes, they do.

55:28.659 --> 55:30.492
And trev loves your dad.

55:30.494 --> 55:32.394
My father loves trev.

55:32.396 --> 55:33.495
But anyway...

55:33.497 --> 55:36.332
Yes, anyway...

55:36.334 --> 55:37.399
There is one individual.

55:37.401 --> 55:40.135
Do you know
the spiritual guide
serena soo?

55:41.071 --> 55:42.004
Didn't she believe
she was, like,

55:42.006 --> 55:43.172
Napoleon or something?

55:43.174 --> 55:45.874
Well, she's quite
misguided in her beliefs,

55:45.876 --> 55:49.345
But her manner is at least
calm and harmonious.

55:49.347 --> 55:50.412
That's perfect.

55:50.414 --> 55:52.031
So here's the plan.

55:52.032 --> 55:53.649
We'll tell our parents
that we want
to throw 'em a party.

55:53.651 --> 55:54.983
You know, to make
things up to them.

55:54.985 --> 55:58.087
Parents love it when
you say you're gonna
make things up to them.

55:58.089 --> 55:59.988
We'll invite everybody,
and presto!

55:59.990 --> 56:01.056
Chemistry takes over.

56:01.058 --> 56:03.525
My dad has me
and trev this weekend.

56:03.527 --> 56:05.060
It's perfect.

56:06.497 --> 56:08.330
I don't know how
to tell you this,

56:08.332 --> 56:11.266
But you were right, trev.

56:11.268 --> 56:12.835
Cos is an alien.

56:12.837 --> 56:14.269
I know that.

56:14.271 --> 56:17.005
A <i> bad</i> alien.

56:17.007 --> 56:18.841
He is not.

56:19.110 --> 56:23.946
Trevor, when have
I ever lied to you?

56:23.948 --> 56:25.848
Every day?

56:26.283 --> 56:27.583
Well, this time I'm not.

56:27.585 --> 56:32.254
Cosmo is one seriously
scary alien.

56:33.457 --> 56:37.760
I didn't want to have
to show you this, but...

56:38.362 --> 56:39.762
Look.

56:40.531 --> 56:42.248
"my plane..."

56:42.249 --> 56:43.966
Plan. My plan
to take over the world.

56:43.968 --> 56:45.934
By cosmo cola.

56:45.936 --> 56:47.202
Chapter one...

56:47.204 --> 56:49.204
Eat trevor.

56:53.310 --> 56:56.345
W-what do I need to do?

56:58.282 --> 57:00.482
 All right 

57:01.419 --> 57:03.385
Mom and cos'll be back
in a couple of minutes,

57:03.387 --> 57:07.523
And my dad
and serena soo'll
be here, too.

57:08.092 --> 57:09.325
 First of all 

57:09.326 --> 57:10.686
 when you wake up
in the evening 

57:12.262 --> 57:13.962
 find yourself thinking
about the things... 

57:13.964 --> 57:15.798
What are you doing?

57:17.234 --> 57:20.569
Ariel, what are you doing?

57:20.571 --> 57:22.504
I am preparing the food.

57:22.506 --> 57:24.306
I put the stuff
in different bowls
'cause they're, like,

57:24.308 --> 57:26.141
Actually different parts
of the meal.

57:26.143 --> 57:28.811
Do they not all end up
in the intestinal tract?

57:28.813 --> 57:31.079
Well, yeah, but...

57:33.484 --> 57:36.785
 Put a smile
on your face... 

57:36.787 --> 57:39.021
I will be rid of her soon.

57:39.023 --> 57:41.523
 Put a smile on your face 

57:41.525 --> 57:43.926
 make the world
a better place... 

57:43.928 --> 57:45.427
I am serena soo.

57:45.429 --> 57:48.330
You <i> must</i> be megan.

57:48.332 --> 57:50.866
Hi. Come on in.

57:54.605 --> 57:56.305
Ariel!

57:56.307 --> 58:00.442
My sweet!
It's been days!

58:00.444 --> 58:01.810
Where is your father?

58:01.812 --> 58:03.445
 You can say
that I'm a dreamer... 

58:03.447 --> 58:05.047
Can I come out yet?

58:05.049 --> 58:08.050
Go back to bed, trev.

58:08.486 --> 58:10.136
Who's that lady?

58:10.137 --> 58:11.787
She's a bad alien, too.

58:11.789 --> 58:13.856
Go back to your room, ok?

58:13.858 --> 58:15.424
Aww...

58:15.860 --> 58:18.126
You were mickey mantle, roky.

58:18.128 --> 58:20.696
A famous baseball player.

58:20.698 --> 58:23.232
Maybe you two
could get a game up.

58:23.234 --> 58:24.032
Cos: Oh, my!

58:24.034 --> 58:26.835
It was wonderful!
It was sick!

58:26.837 --> 58:29.571
I rode underneath the board.

58:29.573 --> 58:31.673
He really did.

58:31.675 --> 58:34.042
Wow, look at this!

58:34.044 --> 58:35.310
Great job, girls.

58:35.312 --> 58:37.179
Daddy, look who has joined us.

58:37.181 --> 58:38.313
Our neighbor, serena soo.

58:38.315 --> 58:39.982
What's the news, serena soo?

58:39.984 --> 58:43.485
You possess great
savage bluster, mr. Cola,

58:43.487 --> 58:46.755
And yet, there is
an inner child crying out

58:46.757 --> 58:50.392
For tenderness and compassion.

58:50.394 --> 58:53.161
Actually, I think
that's my stomach.

58:53.163 --> 58:54.263
Must be hungry!

58:57.167 --> 58:57.866
Hi!

58:57.868 --> 59:00.235
I'm kathy larson.

59:00.236 --> 59:02.603
Kathy, you wear
a nimbus of distrust.

59:02.606 --> 59:05.207
Right. I got it
at the mall.

59:05.209 --> 59:08.410
Humor can be such
an effective defense,

59:08.412 --> 59:09.511
Can't it, kathy?

59:09.513 --> 59:14.049
Only against people who
have no sense of humor.

59:14.051 --> 59:17.419
Would you like something
to drink, serena?

59:17.421 --> 59:20.122
I will have a chai.

59:23.260 --> 59:25.594
Megan. Ariel.

59:25.596 --> 59:27.396
What are you girls up to?

59:28.566 --> 59:30.332
I'll get it!

59:32.403 --> 59:33.869
Daddy!

59:33.871 --> 59:35.487
Honey, hi.

59:35.488 --> 59:37.104
Kathy:
Fred? What are you
doing here today?

59:37.107 --> 59:38.874
Megan told me to come today.

59:38.876 --> 59:40.726
You did?

59:40.727 --> 59:42.577
Well, I thought
daddy might want
to join us for dinner.

59:42.580 --> 59:43.580
About that, honey,

59:43.581 --> 59:45.881
I still have some work to do.

59:45.883 --> 59:47.282
Is it ok if I just
pick you guys up

59:47.284 --> 59:48.650
And bring you back to my place?

59:48.652 --> 59:50.452
I can bring my stuff
home and work

59:50.454 --> 59:53.255
While you guys watch tv.
What do you say?

59:53.257 --> 59:55.390
But we can't, daddy, because...

59:55.392 --> 59:57.492
Because trev...
He's sick.

59:57.494 --> 59:58.327
Really he is.

59:58.329 --> 01:00:00.996
Come on, I'll show you.

01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:19.314
Elizabeth,
I'm coming to join ya.

01:00:19.316 --> 01:00:20.316
Elizabeth!

01:00:20.317 --> 01:00:22.117
Fred sanford! Excellent!

01:00:22.119 --> 01:00:23.852
Trevor: Elizabeth!

01:00:23.854 --> 01:00:25.354
Trevor?

01:00:29.827 --> 01:00:31.860
If you and mom
get back together,

01:00:31.862 --> 01:00:35.797
Can I still play
with cos sometimes,

01:00:35.799 --> 01:00:37.532
Even if he is bad?

01:00:37.534 --> 01:00:38.767
Who's cos?

01:00:38.768 --> 01:00:40.001
Megan: Um, dad,
are you sure you don't want

01:00:40.004 --> 01:00:44.539
To stay for dinner, as long
as you're already here?

01:00:46.377 --> 01:00:50.145
Megan: Things were not going
exactly as I'd planned,

01:00:50.147 --> 01:00:53.215
And in the kitchen, diary,
it was even worse.

01:00:53.217 --> 01:00:54.549
I must tell you,

01:00:54.551 --> 01:00:58.053
Serena soo, that many,
if not <i> all</i> of your ideas

01:00:58.055 --> 01:01:02.457
Are highly improbable,
if not impossible.

01:01:02.459 --> 01:01:04.459
You're blocking
the trauma, cosmo.

01:01:04.461 --> 01:01:07.663
You did die in the civil war.

01:01:07.665 --> 01:01:09.164
I promise you I didn't.

01:01:09.166 --> 01:01:10.616
You really did,

01:01:10.617 --> 01:01:12.067
And you were a raccoon
in another life.

01:01:12.069 --> 01:01:14.469
Where do you come up
with these things?

01:01:14.471 --> 01:01:18.140
I'm highly sensitive,

01:01:18.142 --> 01:01:19.474
And I am also prescient.

01:01:19.476 --> 01:01:22.044
I know what is going to happen.

01:01:22.046 --> 01:01:23.445
Do you?

01:01:23.446 --> 01:01:24.845
Yes, it's a great gi...

01:01:26.216 --> 01:01:28.150
I don't know what you
kids are up to, megan,

01:01:28.152 --> 01:01:30.485
But if you want to come
to my house for dinner,

01:01:30.487 --> 01:01:31.487
We'd better get going.

01:01:31.488 --> 01:01:32.854
I've already lost an hour.

01:01:32.856 --> 01:01:35.524
Then you'll only be 23/7 today?

01:01:35.526 --> 01:01:37.092
Very funny.

01:01:37.094 --> 01:01:38.493
Who are you?

01:01:38.495 --> 01:01:42.431
Cosmo cola...
Kathy's fiance.

01:01:43.667 --> 01:01:45.701
When did this happen?

01:01:45.703 --> 01:01:47.602
It was kind of sudden.

01:01:47.604 --> 01:01:50.739
Cosmo and I met shortly
after he and ariel,

01:01:50.741 --> 01:01:54.476
His daughter, moved
here from the yukon.

01:01:57.347 --> 01:02:00.449
No one lives in the yukon.

01:02:00.451 --> 01:02:03.518
Anyway, we're
very happy together,

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:06.354
And we've decided to marry.

01:02:08.625 --> 01:02:10.726
I need an antacid.

01:02:11.462 --> 01:02:13.862
It's not an antacid you need.

01:02:13.864 --> 01:02:15.130
It's harmony.

01:02:15.132 --> 01:02:16.765
What?

01:02:16.766 --> 01:02:18.399
Your soul is that of a warrior.

01:02:18.402 --> 01:02:20.869
It needs to be calmed,
not excited.

01:02:20.871 --> 01:02:24.706
You are very perceptive.

01:02:24.708 --> 01:02:28.610
I...Am serena soo.

01:02:29.313 --> 01:02:31.279
Fred larson.

01:02:32.149 --> 01:02:34.516
Dinnertime, everybody.

01:02:35.152 --> 01:02:38.754
Ok... Mom, you can sit
over there next to dad...

01:02:38.756 --> 01:02:42.157
And cos and serena soo
can sit right here
next to each other.

01:02:42.159 --> 01:02:46.328
You know,
for a nice mix and all.

01:02:46.330 --> 01:02:47.996
Trevor, not there.

01:02:47.998 --> 01:02:50.298
You give
and you give
and you give, fred.

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:53.468
24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

01:02:53.470 --> 01:02:55.003
And what do you ask for
in return?

01:02:55.005 --> 01:02:58.440
A little respect.
A little consideration.

01:02:58.442 --> 01:03:00.742
It's true.

01:03:04.681 --> 01:03:06.748
Well, girls, this looks...

01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:10.719
Very inventive.

01:03:11.021 --> 01:03:13.421
They used my recipe.

01:03:13.423 --> 01:03:15.423
Serena soo:
Perhaps I could
cleanse your aura.

01:03:15.425 --> 01:03:18.627
I've never had anyone
cleanse my aura before.

01:03:18.629 --> 01:03:21.429
Oh, you must let me do
a psychic reading...

01:03:21.431 --> 01:03:23.698
Megan: This had
to be stopped, diary.

01:03:23.699 --> 01:03:25.966
Dad was right on the verge
of falling in love
with the blair witch.

01:03:25.969 --> 01:03:28.136
So I did the first thing
I could think of.

01:03:28.138 --> 01:03:30.272
I'm sure I could
squeeze in a little...

01:03:30.274 --> 01:03:31.824
Aah!

01:03:31.825 --> 01:03:33.375
I know, I know.
It seems totally lame.

01:03:33.377 --> 01:03:35.477
But at that moment,
it was all I could think of

01:03:35.479 --> 01:03:38.113
To at least get people
mad at each other...

01:03:38.115 --> 01:03:40.382
But even that didn't work.

01:03:42.786 --> 01:03:43.952
At last!

01:03:43.954 --> 01:03:46.988
The perfect moment!

01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:49.224
Aah!

01:03:49.459 --> 01:03:51.076
Whoo hoo...
Ho ho!

01:03:51.077 --> 01:03:52.694
I don't think I ever used
the word debacle before,
diary,

01:03:52.696 --> 01:03:54.563
But this was definitely one...

01:03:54.565 --> 01:03:55.831
Or maybe it was a fiasco.

01:03:55.833 --> 01:03:58.900
Whatever it was, it wasn't good.

01:04:01.354 --> 01:04:03.805
I looked over at ariel,
and she looked super-strange.

01:04:03.807 --> 01:04:05.507
It was like, I don't know...

01:04:05.509 --> 01:04:08.543
She was falling apart
or something.

01:04:08.545 --> 01:04:10.045
And when I followed her,

01:04:10.047 --> 01:04:11.213
The weirdest thing
ever happened.

01:04:11.215 --> 01:04:13.348
I'm not even really sure
how to describe it.

01:04:33.537 --> 01:04:34.769
Aah!
Aah!

01:04:34.771 --> 01:04:35.771
Aah!
Aah!

01:04:35.772 --> 01:04:37.639
Aah!
Aah!

01:04:38.942 --> 01:04:39.942
She has no body!

01:04:39.943 --> 01:04:41.176
She has no body!

01:04:41.178 --> 01:04:42.777
She's just like a blob!

01:04:42.779 --> 01:04:45.080
What are you
talking about, megan?

01:04:45.415 --> 01:04:46.381
Get away from me!

01:04:46.383 --> 01:04:48.416
Megan, what is wrong with you?

01:04:48.418 --> 01:04:49.851
What is wrong with you guys?

01:04:49.853 --> 01:04:52.921
Didn't you her me?
She's an alien!

01:04:54.391 --> 01:05:00.528
Maybe you feel like an alien
sometimes, megan, hmm?

01:05:01.365 --> 01:05:04.199
I've seen this reaction before.

01:05:04.201 --> 01:05:05.367
It's hardly uncommon.

01:05:05.369 --> 01:05:08.803
Many children fear change
of this magnitude.

01:05:08.805 --> 01:05:12.073
Megan has gotten used to
your current living arrangement,

01:05:12.075 --> 01:05:14.743
Not sharing you,
at least with another parent.

01:05:14.745 --> 01:05:17.312
With your impending marriage,

01:05:17.314 --> 01:05:20.548
That balance will be upset.

01:05:20.550 --> 01:05:24.319
This alien story
is merely an attempt

01:05:24.321 --> 01:05:25.620
To prevent that from happening.

01:05:25.622 --> 01:05:30.158
Then you think it's
all right to go through
with the wedding?

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:32.327
As long as it's what you want.

01:05:32.329 --> 01:05:38.333
I think it's imperative...
For her sake.

01:05:41.004 --> 01:05:43.471
How do I look?

01:05:43.473 --> 01:05:45.340
Great.

01:05:45.342 --> 01:05:47.776
This is all gonna work out, meg.

01:05:47.778 --> 01:05:48.576
I promise.

01:05:48.578 --> 01:05:50.512
Mom, he's an alien.

01:05:50.514 --> 01:05:52.614
I know.
But after we're married,

01:05:52.616 --> 01:05:55.417
He wants to become a citizen.

01:05:55.419 --> 01:05:58.253
That's not what I meant.

01:05:58.588 --> 01:06:01.222
I know.

01:06:04.427 --> 01:06:06.761
Isn't there anything
I can do to stop you
from marrying cos?

01:06:06.763 --> 01:06:08.446
Megan...

01:06:08.447 --> 01:06:10.130
Well, it's just that
you promised you
wouldn't marry him

01:06:10.133 --> 01:06:11.866
If I didn't learn to like him.

01:06:11.868 --> 01:06:12.968
Oh, megan, honey,

01:06:12.970 --> 01:06:15.303
I have thought about this
long and hard,

01:06:15.305 --> 01:06:17.939
And I've talked to
the doctor about it.

01:06:17.941 --> 01:06:23.511
If I, for one second, thought
your fears were justified...

01:06:23.513 --> 01:06:25.380
I know that he's different.

01:06:25.382 --> 01:06:29.317
It's part of what makes him
so wonderful.

01:06:29.319 --> 01:06:31.786
Cosmo makes me so happy, honey.

01:06:31.788 --> 01:06:36.858
And I know that
this marriage is gonna
make this family happy, too.

01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:38.526
Do you think I'm going crazy?

01:06:38.528 --> 01:06:42.497
We're all a little
crazy around here.

01:06:42.499 --> 01:06:45.467
That's what makes us so special.

01:06:45.469 --> 01:06:46.701
I love you, sweetie.

01:06:46.703 --> 01:06:50.071
I love you, too, mom.

01:06:50.674 --> 01:06:54.109
Everything is gonna
work out just fine.

01:06:54.745 --> 01:07:01.716
 All I need, all my life,
is to love somebody... 

01:07:01.718 --> 01:07:03.385
Oh, no, thank you.

01:07:03.987 --> 01:07:07.088
Ha ha, roky.
Hi, baby.

01:07:07.090 --> 01:07:10.592
Megan, you look beautiful.

01:07:10.594 --> 01:07:12.327
Yes, future daughter,
you're more lovely

01:07:12.329 --> 01:07:14.562
Than cornflakes and root bear.

01:07:14.564 --> 01:07:15.430
Heh heh.

01:07:15.432 --> 01:07:17.332
Thanks... I guess.

01:07:17.334 --> 01:07:18.833
Where's ariel?

01:07:18.835 --> 01:07:21.336
Uh, she'll be
joining us shortly.

01:07:21.338 --> 01:07:24.839
I believe she needed
a moment of meditation to...

01:07:24.841 --> 01:07:27.475
Collect herself.

01:07:27.476 --> 01:07:30.110
Or maybe she's just
kicking back in the sink.

01:07:32.082 --> 01:07:37.352
Good-bye, zircalon.
Good-bye, fanul.

01:07:37.354 --> 01:07:41.523
Good-bye, saweeza.

01:07:43.427 --> 01:07:45.193
Hello, saweeza.

01:07:45.195 --> 01:07:48.396
Is it possible?
Is it?

01:07:48.398 --> 01:07:50.131
It is I, fanul.

01:07:50.133 --> 01:07:52.767
Fanul... Powerfully
grateful I am
to see you.

01:07:52.769 --> 01:07:56.638
Please! Saweeza,
such physical proximity
is repulsive to me.

01:07:56.640 --> 01:08:00.341
Um... I'm sorry, fanul.

01:08:02.479 --> 01:08:03.978
We must move quickly.

01:08:03.980 --> 01:08:06.948
Daddy, or cosmo cola,
as he is called here,

01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:09.217
Is supposed to commit
himself in marriage

01:08:09.219 --> 01:08:10.785
To the earth woman,
kathy larson,

01:08:10.787 --> 01:08:13.121
In less than an hour.

01:08:13.122 --> 01:08:15.456
S'vad: Your father is very
dangerous to me, saweeza.

01:08:15.459 --> 01:08:17.392
He wants change.

01:08:17.394 --> 01:08:20.295
What is our view of change,
fanul?

01:08:20.296 --> 01:08:22.096
Change is bad.

01:08:22.098 --> 01:08:23.898
Things should and must stay
exactly as they are.

01:08:23.899 --> 01:08:27.769
But change is not
always bad, emperor.

01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:29.636
Saweeza.

01:08:29.639 --> 01:08:33.508
Already this planet
has poisoned her mind.

01:08:33.510 --> 01:08:36.511
Have you ever been
frozen solid, saweeza?

01:08:36.513 --> 01:08:40.915
It can be reversed,
but only at my pleasure.

01:08:41.484 --> 01:08:44.419
You wouldn't want
your father to be
frozen forever,

01:08:44.421 --> 01:08:46.921
Would you, saweeza?

01:08:46.923 --> 01:08:49.890
No.

01:08:49.892 --> 01:08:52.859
Good. Then you will lead
us to him, won't you?

01:08:53.363 --> 01:08:54.162
Won't you?

01:08:54.163 --> 01:08:56.430
Hello, is the loo <i> occupado?</i>

01:08:56.433 --> 01:08:59.367
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:08:59.368 --> 01:09:00.935
Wrong room.

01:09:00.937 --> 01:09:03.537
Hello, serena soo.

01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:06.474
Ariel, my sweet.

01:09:06.475 --> 01:09:10.444
Well, who are
your charming friends?

01:09:10.447 --> 01:09:13.214
This is mike...

01:09:13.216 --> 01:09:14.349
And his father, doug.

01:09:14.350 --> 01:09:16.551
They're from the yukon also.

01:09:16.553 --> 01:09:17.318
Pleasure.

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:19.319
You will lead us to cosmo cola.

01:09:19.322 --> 01:09:21.890
Oh, there is no need
to be so tense.

01:09:21.892 --> 01:09:25.460
Would you like some
nice relaxing herbal gum?

01:09:25.462 --> 01:09:26.728
Be silent.

01:09:26.729 --> 01:09:29.531
Aah!

01:09:29.533 --> 01:09:33.468
What annoying
creatures these
earthlings are.

01:09:34.136 --> 01:09:36.504
Emperor, perhaps you are right.

01:09:36.506 --> 01:09:38.305
Perhaps we are
annoying creatures...

01:09:38.308 --> 01:09:39.640
"we"?

01:09:39.643 --> 01:09:41.209
They...

01:09:41.211 --> 01:09:46.014
But, emperor, there's
more to it than that.

01:09:46.015 --> 01:09:49.484
There's a warmth
and kindness
to these humans,

01:09:49.486 --> 01:09:52.319
A bravery
that might surprise you...

01:09:52.322 --> 01:09:53.888
If you gave 'em a chance.

01:09:53.890 --> 01:09:57.058
Sometimes...
One must be cruel

01:09:57.060 --> 01:10:00.395
In order to be kind, saweeza.

01:10:00.397 --> 01:10:03.164
Fanul, guard the prisoner.

01:10:03.166 --> 01:10:07.936
I shall find cosmo cola myself.

01:10:12.409 --> 01:10:13.508
Fanul, please.

01:10:13.510 --> 01:10:15.910
He is my father, saweeza.

01:10:15.912 --> 01:10:18.413
I have no choice.

01:10:19.549 --> 01:10:22.250
I wish I did.

01:10:24.955 --> 01:10:26.921
Intruder alert!
Intruder alert!

01:10:26.923 --> 01:10:29.524
Uh, cute kid.
Excuse me.

01:10:29.526 --> 01:10:31.092
Where do you want
the 82 cases
of root beer?

01:10:31.094 --> 01:10:33.261
I will assist
with the beverages.

01:10:33.263 --> 01:10:34.395
Hurry back.

01:10:34.397 --> 01:10:35.547
Come, young trevor.

01:10:35.548 --> 01:10:36.698
We will vanquish
the villains together!

01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:42.370
Megan, can you go see
if you can find ariel?
We're about to start.

01:10:42.606 --> 01:10:44.439
In a minute.

01:10:44.441 --> 01:10:46.424
Megan,
the future mrs. Cola,

01:10:46.425 --> 01:10:48.408
I'm telling you,
it is a lovely day
for a wedding.

01:10:48.411 --> 01:10:51.913
Of course,
I'd rather be windsurfing.

01:10:51.915 --> 01:10:53.448
No doubt.

01:10:53.449 --> 01:10:54.982
Megan, I'm serious.
Go find your sister.

01:10:54.985 --> 01:10:56.601
She's not my sister.

01:10:56.602 --> 01:10:58.218
Oh, I'll go get her.
Where is she?

01:10:58.221 --> 01:11:01.489
Come on.

01:11:15.171 --> 01:11:16.938
Man, are these fat-free?

01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:18.072
I mean,
they look fat-free,

01:11:18.074 --> 01:11:22.577
But I've never seen 'em
such a golden brown
before.

01:11:25.749 --> 01:11:27.382
Chip?

01:11:31.121 --> 01:11:32.353
Heh.

01:11:32.355 --> 01:11:34.989
What is that?

01:11:36.293 --> 01:11:39.160
That is serena soo.

01:11:40.130 --> 01:11:43.765
What are you talking about?

01:11:48.371 --> 01:11:50.338
Heh.

01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:53.341
Ariel, what's going on?

01:11:53.343 --> 01:11:54.776
Who is that?

01:11:54.778 --> 01:11:57.278
That is fanul.

01:11:57.280 --> 01:12:00.782
Fanul, your boyfriend, fanul?

01:12:02.519 --> 01:12:04.719
He and his father,
the emperor s'vad,

01:12:04.721 --> 01:12:06.287
Have come for my father.

01:12:06.289 --> 01:12:08.489
I knew that guy
wasn't invited...

01:12:08.491 --> 01:12:10.892
But what does he want
with you your father?

01:12:10.894 --> 01:12:14.562
My father is
a great freedom fighter
on zircalon, megan.

01:12:14.564 --> 01:12:15.730
Zirca-what?

01:12:15.732 --> 01:12:19.367
Zircalon.
Our home planet.

01:12:19.369 --> 01:12:24.505
You were entirely
correct in all of
your inferences, megan.

01:12:24.507 --> 01:12:27.709
My father and I are aliens.

01:12:30.513 --> 01:12:32.146
Why did you come here?

01:12:32.148 --> 01:12:34.849
Just to make me feel
inferior or what?

01:12:34.851 --> 01:12:38.720
We came to escape
political repression
on zircalon.

01:12:38.722 --> 01:12:43.825
We stayed because my
father fell deeply in
love with your mother.

01:12:44.427 --> 01:12:46.160
And that's it?

01:12:46.162 --> 01:12:47.428
You're just a kid who got stuck

01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:51.265
On a whole new planet
where you didn't know anybody?

01:12:51.267 --> 01:12:52.433
That's bogus.

01:12:52.435 --> 01:12:53.601
I changed homeroom last year,

01:12:53.603 --> 01:12:58.406
And it totally
threw me off
for, like, 6 months.

01:13:00.443 --> 01:13:04.679
I guess I haven't been
much of a help, have I?

01:13:04.681 --> 01:13:07.181
You can help me now, megan.

01:13:07.183 --> 01:13:09.917
Well, I can try.

01:13:10.954 --> 01:13:12.854
What?

01:13:12.856 --> 01:13:14.555
I was quite wrong about you.

01:13:14.557 --> 01:13:18.292
You are not
the cruel, heartless
being I once imagined.

01:13:18.294 --> 01:13:22.363
You are, in truth,
incredibly brave
and fearless.

01:13:22.365 --> 01:13:24.632
Well, I'm hardly fearless.

01:13:24.634 --> 01:13:27.068
You are, compared to me.

01:13:27.070 --> 01:13:31.939
Well, hey, who died and
made you dictator, dude?

01:13:31.941 --> 01:13:34.208
Watch this one, too, fanul.

01:13:34.210 --> 01:13:35.743
Yes, father.

01:13:35.744 --> 01:13:37.277
You're extremely rude,
do you know that?

01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:41.449
Silence, peon!

01:13:43.286 --> 01:13:47.789
Man, I seriously gotta
improve my vocabulary.

01:13:47.791 --> 01:13:50.158
Oh, check it out.
It's a party.

01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:53.461
Hey, megan, ariel.

01:13:54.664 --> 01:13:57.832
That's pretty unusual.

01:13:57.834 --> 01:14:00.334
Oh, thank you so much.

01:14:00.336 --> 01:14:01.569
I love that you could come.

01:14:01.571 --> 01:14:04.005
Will you just excuse me?

01:14:05.408 --> 01:14:06.841
Uh-huh.

01:14:07.911 --> 01:14:09.577
Hi, can I help you?

01:14:09.579 --> 01:14:13.247
I'm looking for the one
called cosmo cola.

01:14:13.249 --> 01:14:15.316
Oh, I think he's
still out front.

01:14:15.318 --> 01:14:16.350
If you see him,
would you tell him

01:14:16.352 --> 01:14:19.320
The ceremony's starting in 15...

01:14:19.322 --> 01:14:21.022
Minutes?

01:14:25.161 --> 01:14:27.462
You have taken me far from home.

01:14:27.464 --> 01:14:31.432
Are you ready to pay
for your crimes?

01:14:31.434 --> 01:14:33.501
S'vad?

01:14:33.503 --> 01:14:36.204
Emperor s'vad, to you.

01:14:38.041 --> 01:14:42.009
You will come
with me... Now.

01:14:42.011 --> 01:14:45.813
Whoa. I've never seen
one like that before.

01:14:45.815 --> 01:14:48.616
You want to trade?

01:14:49.219 --> 01:14:51.486
Trevor...

01:14:51.488 --> 01:14:54.489
This is my friend,
mr. S'vad.

01:14:54.491 --> 01:14:55.890
He, uh...

01:14:55.892 --> 01:14:58.559
He loves to play hide and seek.

01:14:58.561 --> 01:14:59.827
Cool.
Me, too.

01:14:59.829 --> 01:15:02.997
So why don't you let us
count to 100...

01:15:02.999 --> 01:15:05.166
And we'll come find you.

01:15:05.168 --> 01:15:08.069
Ok, but no cheating.

01:15:08.071 --> 01:15:10.104
Promise.

01:15:14.878 --> 01:15:17.712
After you.

01:15:18.548 --> 01:15:20.681
Fanul, please?

01:15:20.683 --> 01:15:23.417
Oh, I cannot, saweeza.
I am sorry.

01:15:23.419 --> 01:15:27.154
Look, dweeb,
just let us out
of here now, ok?

01:15:27.156 --> 01:15:29.423
Ok? What?

01:15:29.425 --> 01:15:32.426
This dude's fully scammin'
on you, megan.

01:15:32.428 --> 01:15:34.462
Eww.

01:15:39.936 --> 01:15:42.803
Mint?

01:15:48.344 --> 01:15:49.410
Hmm.

01:15:49.412 --> 01:15:50.545
Curiously strong.

01:15:50.547 --> 01:15:52.530
Oh, exactly.

01:15:52.531 --> 01:15:54.514
You know what?
I find I like
megan's brown head

01:15:54.517 --> 01:15:56.551
Better than ariel's yellow head.

01:15:56.553 --> 01:15:58.419
Ha, I hear ya, bro.

01:15:58.421 --> 01:16:01.055
You see, that's a betty
and veronica thing.

01:16:01.057 --> 01:16:02.423
I mean, that's
freedom of choice.

01:16:02.425 --> 01:16:04.492
Right on, bro.
High 5!

01:16:06.195 --> 01:16:08.062
Never mind, man.

01:16:08.064 --> 01:16:10.431
Have you decided yet
how to best end

01:16:10.433 --> 01:16:11.933
This treacherous captivity?

01:16:11.935 --> 01:16:17.204
Maybe... But you've
got to work with me here.

01:16:18.608 --> 01:16:22.476
So, fanul, you must have
a lot of power

01:16:22.478 --> 01:16:24.045
Back on your home planet.

01:16:24.046 --> 01:16:25.613
You know, being the son
of the emperor and all.

01:16:25.615 --> 01:16:29.250
Well, it's a great honor
to do my father's bidding...

01:16:29.252 --> 01:16:31.652
And time-consuming.

01:16:31.654 --> 01:16:33.621
Well, don't you have
any time for fun?

01:16:33.623 --> 01:16:35.256
Well, my duties do come first,

01:16:35.258 --> 01:16:37.491
But sometimes
I'm allowed to power float.

01:16:37.493 --> 01:16:38.893
It's most enjoyable.

01:16:38.895 --> 01:16:40.661
Uh... How do you do that?

01:16:40.663 --> 01:16:42.396
Well, first, you need
to be a bubble.

01:16:42.398 --> 01:16:44.732
I... I don't think
I could do that.

01:16:44.734 --> 01:16:46.400
So, then, it's kind
of limited, isn't it?

01:16:46.402 --> 01:16:49.971
Around here, we have
lots of free time.
Don't we, cutter?

01:16:49.973 --> 01:16:51.790
Oh, yeah.

01:16:51.791 --> 01:16:53.608
And lots of choices.
Like windsurfing,
skateboarding...

01:16:53.610 --> 01:16:55.843
Oh, oh, hey, fanul,
you ever, like,

01:16:55.845 --> 01:16:58.446
Mountain bike
off a ledge
into a river

01:16:58.448 --> 01:17:00.314
And then, like,
floated down the rapids?

01:17:00.316 --> 01:17:02.149
Now, that is extreme.

01:17:02.151 --> 01:17:03.584
It does sound recreational.

01:17:03.586 --> 01:17:04.852
Oh, definitely, fanul.

01:17:04.854 --> 01:17:06.320
We recreate constantly.

01:17:06.322 --> 01:17:08.456
That's one
of the coolest things
about earth.

01:17:08.458 --> 01:17:09.991
Like last year, for instance,

01:17:09.993 --> 01:17:13.527
I totally bladed
down this mountain.

01:17:14.964 --> 01:17:18.432
You know, I mean, ok,
I kinda fell mostly,

01:17:18.434 --> 01:17:20.134
You know, but it was still cool.

01:17:20.136 --> 01:17:21.636
I was all like, yeah!

01:17:21.638 --> 01:17:23.838
And what other stuff
can we do, cutter?

01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:27.375
Yes, cutter,
what other choices
can we make here?

01:17:27.377 --> 01:17:29.878
Ok, well, like, uh...

01:17:29.879 --> 01:17:32.380
Oh, yeah, we have
fully 18 different
flavors of potato chips,

01:17:32.382 --> 01:17:33.948
All of which are excellent.

01:17:33.950 --> 01:17:38.819
Except yogurt-flavored,
it's kinda weird.

01:17:38.821 --> 01:17:40.655
You see, fanul,

01:17:40.656 --> 01:17:42.490
This planet
is all about
freedom of choice.

01:17:42.492 --> 01:17:45.459
Can you imagine,
people here have
the freedom

01:17:45.461 --> 01:17:46.293
To fall down mountains,

01:17:46.295 --> 01:17:48.362
Eat the chips of many flavors.

01:17:48.364 --> 01:17:49.897
Be vapid and shallow.

01:17:49.899 --> 01:17:51.399
Uh, uh, exactly.

01:17:51.401 --> 01:17:55.002
But your dad, man,
he's like a full-on
tyrant, dude.

01:17:55.004 --> 01:17:59.473
Whoa, I didn't even know
I knew that word.

01:17:59.475 --> 01:18:00.875
Tyrant. Cool.

01:18:00.877 --> 01:18:04.211
He doesn't want
any freedom at all.

01:18:04.914 --> 01:18:06.047
He, like, froze that lady.

01:18:06.049 --> 01:18:09.483
You know?
Ok, it may look
really cool,

01:18:09.485 --> 01:18:11.552
You know, but...
It isn't.

01:18:11.554 --> 01:18:14.355
In fact, here,
it is the very
antithesis of cool.

01:18:14.357 --> 01:18:17.258
Which, I suppose,
would be uncool.

01:18:17.260 --> 01:18:18.592
I think I understand.

01:18:18.594 --> 01:18:20.478
Oh, righteous!

01:18:20.479 --> 01:18:22.363
So, then, maybe it's time
you stand up to your father?

01:18:22.365 --> 01:18:24.098
For, like, freedom
and liberty, right?

01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:27.835
'cause this may be,
like, the only planet
in this entire universe

01:18:27.837 --> 01:18:30.871
With 18 different
flavors of potato chips,
ok?

01:18:30.873 --> 01:18:33.374
I mean, you gotta think of that.

01:18:33.376 --> 01:18:34.341
Say it, fanul.

01:18:34.343 --> 01:18:35.543
I know you have it in you.

01:18:35.545 --> 01:18:37.411
I know that goodness
and righteousness

01:18:37.413 --> 01:18:40.514
Make up the very
core of your being.

01:18:49.559 --> 01:18:52.193
We're out of here, dudes.

01:18:54.230 --> 01:18:57.298
I can see why
you like fanul.
He's kinda cute.

01:18:57.300 --> 01:19:02.703
I found him
more appealing as
a shimmering gasbag.

01:19:10.379 --> 01:19:15.282
Enter the teleportation
grid, prisoner.

01:19:17.453 --> 01:19:18.385
S'vad, listen...

01:19:18.387 --> 01:19:20.020
Traitor!

01:19:20.021 --> 01:19:21.654
For the crime
of questioning
my authority,

01:19:21.657 --> 01:19:25.059
I hereby sentence you
and your daughter...

01:19:25.061 --> 01:19:28.395
To be eternally frozen.

01:19:28.397 --> 01:19:30.731
Please, not saweeza.
Take me!

01:19:37.907 --> 01:19:40.608
Good, fanul,
did you bring the girl?

01:19:40.610 --> 01:19:42.777
Yes, father.

01:19:42.779 --> 01:19:45.479
What is this?
That's not saweeza.

01:19:45.481 --> 01:19:47.415
No, but I'm her stepsister...

01:19:47.416 --> 01:19:49.350
And that happens to be
my stepfather that
you have there.

01:19:49.352 --> 01:19:53.287
So you better
let 'em go now, ok?

01:19:53.289 --> 01:19:55.823
Brownhead!

01:19:55.825 --> 01:19:56.957
What is the meaning of this?

01:19:56.959 --> 01:19:59.794
It's time to make
some changes, father.

01:19:59.796 --> 01:20:01.028
Change?

01:20:01.030 --> 01:20:03.030
Clearly your mind
has been warped.

01:20:03.032 --> 01:20:04.331
When we get home,
I will remind you

01:20:04.333 --> 01:20:08.135
That the price
for change is
eternal freezing.

01:20:08.137 --> 01:20:09.637
Now enter the grid.

01:20:09.639 --> 01:20:11.005
Not until you let them go.

01:20:11.007 --> 01:20:14.008
Put the prisoner in the grid!

01:20:14.010 --> 01:20:14.675
No!

01:20:14.677 --> 01:20:17.378
You're not taking cosmo.

01:20:17.947 --> 01:20:20.815
Hold it right there, gasbag.

01:20:20.817 --> 01:20:23.350
Don't mess with my family, dude.

01:20:23.352 --> 01:20:25.653
No doubt.

01:20:40.169 --> 01:20:45.873
Foolish children,
do not question
my authority!

01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:57.585
It's incredible.
Can you believe this?

01:20:57.587 --> 01:20:58.886
I'm sure they'll be here...

01:20:58.888 --> 01:21:01.989
Any minute now.

01:21:05.895 --> 01:21:11.298
Your tiny machines
have no effect on me.

01:21:13.903 --> 01:21:17.004
Megan:
This is very not good.

01:21:18.174 --> 01:21:22.843
Ariel, fanul...

01:21:27.383 --> 01:21:30.784
Try this on for size, sucker!

01:21:30.786 --> 01:21:32.553
Not the wind!

01:21:32.555 --> 01:21:35.489
Not the wind!

01:21:35.791 --> 01:21:37.725
Trevor, you fully rock.

01:21:37.727 --> 01:21:42.529
Oh, trevor-man, yeah!
Go, trevor.

01:21:45.101 --> 01:21:48.402
Can't they see we're trying
to have a wedding here?

01:21:48.404 --> 01:21:50.704
What nerve.

01:22:02.785 --> 01:22:04.118
All right.

01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:06.954
Sweet!
All right! Unreal!

01:22:06.956 --> 01:22:09.089
Hey, that was cool,
trevor-man.

01:22:09.091 --> 01:22:11.959
Does this mean cos
can go back to being
a good alien?

01:22:11.961 --> 01:22:13.394
Cool.

01:22:16.499 --> 01:22:19.099
Daddy! Ha ha!
Ohh! Ha ha ha!

01:22:19.101 --> 01:22:20.334
Thank you, megan larson.

01:22:20.336 --> 01:22:21.669
We're family...

01:22:21.670 --> 01:22:23.003
Or at least
we're supposed to be.

01:22:23.005 --> 01:22:25.189
What time is it?

01:22:25.190 --> 01:22:27.374
Time for you to get married.

01:22:28.144 --> 01:22:30.911
Really, thank you,
I'm sorry, at any minute.

01:22:30.913 --> 01:22:32.079
Cos: Kathy!

01:22:32.081 --> 01:22:34.515
Mom!

01:22:34.784 --> 01:22:36.483
So sorry to have
kept you waiting.

01:22:36.485 --> 01:22:40.688
I would wait forever for you.

01:22:42.291 --> 01:22:47.628
Honey, have you seen serena?

01:22:47.630 --> 01:22:48.495
Uhh.

01:22:48.497 --> 01:22:50.464
Cosmo, repeat after me:

01:22:50.466 --> 01:22:54.435
I, cosmo, take thee,
katherine, to be my wife.

01:22:54.437 --> 01:22:58.339
I, cosmo, take thee,
katherine, to be my wife.

01:22:58.341 --> 01:23:01.342
To have and to hold
from this day forward...

01:23:01.344 --> 01:23:04.878
To have and to hold
from this day forward...

01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:05.880
To love...

01:23:08.484 --> 01:23:09.316
Fred larson.

01:23:09.318 --> 01:23:10.768
Megan: Well, diary,

01:23:10.769 --> 01:23:12.219
I guess some things are just
never gonna change.

01:23:12.221 --> 01:23:14.054
No, that's fine.
No, ring me any time.

01:23:14.056 --> 01:23:16.156
Reverend: To love,
honor, and cherish...

01:23:16.158 --> 01:23:19.326
Cos: To love,
honor, and cherish...

01:23:19.328 --> 01:23:20.361
For richer, for poorer...

01:23:20.363 --> 01:23:21.295
For richer, for poorer...

01:23:21.297 --> 01:23:24.298
 it was you that 

01:23:24.300 --> 01:23:30.471
 picked me up
when I was down 

01:23:30.473 --> 01:23:37.211
 one look in your eyes
can turn me around 

01:23:37.213 --> 01:23:38.879
Do you really have
to go back to zircalon?

01:23:38.881 --> 01:23:40.881
With my father
in his current condition,

01:23:40.883 --> 01:23:43.017
It's up to me
to govern our planet.

01:23:43.019 --> 01:23:44.418
I'll come back...

01:23:44.420 --> 01:23:46.887
Once I've made a few changes.

01:23:50.860 --> 01:23:53.027
Ariel: Life
on this strange planet

01:23:53.029 --> 01:23:57.331
Continues to confuse
and amuse me, diary.

01:23:57.333 --> 01:23:59.367
It's odd.

01:23:59.368 --> 01:24:01.402
I thought my life
was completely over
when I came to earth.

01:24:01.404 --> 01:24:05.406
But now I can see that
it was only just beginning.

01:24:05.408 --> 01:24:10.110
A new boyfriend who,
as far as cumbersome
bags of skin goes,

01:24:10.112 --> 01:24:12.079
Is actually quite appealing.

01:24:12.081 --> 01:24:14.348
A new stepmother...

01:24:14.350 --> 01:24:17.151
Even a new best friend.

01:24:17.953 --> 01:24:19.787
Megan:
Well, diary, I guess this
is the part where I admit

01:24:19.789 --> 01:24:23.757
That I actually learned
something from these last
couple months... And I did,

01:24:23.759 --> 01:24:26.593
But I think
I'll just keep it to myself.

01:24:26.595 --> 01:24:29.229
I mean, who would ever
believe all this anyway?

01:24:29.231 --> 01:24:32.199
Let's just say,
thanks to my new stepsister,

01:24:32.201 --> 01:24:35.769
There's room for everybody
at the popular table.

01:24:35.771 --> 01:24:38.372
Come on, sit with us.
