07:58.792 --> 08:00.083
I wanted to call you,

08:00.125 --> 08:02.625
but then I thought

08:00.125 --> 08:02.625
I should tell you in person.

08:02.667 --> 08:03.667
We both did.

08:04.083 --> 08:06.625
So here we are. Telling you...

08:07.750 --> 08:09.291
BOTH: In person.

08:10.166 --> 08:11.750
Anyway, we're going to

08:10.166 --> 08:11.750
go grab some drinks.

08:11.792 --> 08:14.250
Semira and Gerald are coming.

08:11.792 --> 08:14.250
Do you want to come join us?

08:14.291 --> 08:18.625
Oh, yeah, I do. But I can't.

08:14.291 --> 08:18.625
Because, uh...

08:19.166 --> 08:20.458
Are you okay?

08:20.500 --> 08:25.000
Oh, yeah, yeah. Just go.

08:20.500 --> 08:25.000
Enjoy going out together.

08:27.500 --> 08:30.875
All right. Have fun

08:27.500 --> 08:30.875
with your fan club.

08:34.917 --> 08:36.709
Just got a few things here.

08:37.709 --> 08:39.500
Uh-uh. <i> Subeesu.</i>

08:39.917 --> 08:42.333
Oh, no, no, I couldn't.

08:39.917 --> 08:42.333
This is too much.

08:42.375 --> 08:44.917
Sometime too much,

08:42.375 --> 08:44.917
sometime too little.

08:44.959 --> 08:46.625
It all even out.

08:46.667 --> 08:47.834
(RUSTLING)

08:47.875 --> 08:49.291
Oh, sorry!

08:49.917 --> 08:51.667
Okay, okay. Stop! Stop!

08:54.709 --> 08:57.375
(SIGHS) I have to go help

08:54.709 --> 08:57.375
Three Stooges.

08:57.709 --> 09:00.041
APPA: (EXCLAIMING)

08:57.709 --> 09:00.041
Okay, okay, okay.

09:00.083 --> 09:01.375
MAN: Sorry.

09:00.083 --> 09:01.375
I got it, I got it.

09:02.875 --> 09:04.750
I hope this won't offend you,

09:04.792 --> 09:08.750
but I am uncomfortable with

09:04.792 --> 09:08.750
this whole <i> subeesu </i> thing.

09:08.792 --> 09:10.583
(SIGHS) He is stubborn.

09:10.625 --> 09:12.625
Sometime more pride

09:10.625 --> 09:12.625
than sense.

09:12.667 --> 09:14.792
-I want to pay for this.

09:12.667 --> 09:14.792
-I want you to pay for this.

09:14.834 --> 09:16.417
But I don't want to

09:14.834 --> 09:16.417
offend your culture.

09:16.458 --> 09:20.709
Ah, culture is okay.

09:16.458 --> 09:20.709
Husband is other story.

09:21.333 --> 09:22.792
Sorry. I'll buy this...

09:22.834 --> 09:26.083
Okay, you pretend to accept

09:22.834 --> 09:26.083
<i>subeesu </i> from him,

09:26.125 --> 09:28.750
but I keep track.

09:26.125 --> 09:28.750
Then you pay me later.

09:28.792 --> 09:31.542
-What you think?

09:28.792 --> 09:31.542
-Yes. Thank you.

09:31.583 --> 09:33.291
He come for one can soup,

09:33.333 --> 09:36.291
now have to buy five bag of

09:33.333 --> 09:36.291
cookie crumb. (CHUCKLES)

09:37.208 --> 09:38.750
Okay, what we having?

09:38.792 --> 09:41.542
Mrs. Kim was just putting

09:38.792 --> 09:41.542
my things in a bag.

09:41.583 --> 09:43.542
Oh! One more.

09:41.583 --> 09:43.542
Very special treat.

09:53.166 --> 09:54.625
So beautiful.

09:56.709 --> 09:58.667
So beautiful.

09:58.709 --> 10:00.750
-$60?

09:58.709 --> 10:00.750
<i>-Subeesu.</i>

10:01.500 --> 10:02.792
So beautiful.

10:13.709 --> 10:16.500
-JANET: He's nice, right?

10:13.709 --> 10:16.500
-He's clearly crazy about you.

10:16.542 --> 10:18.291
-You think so?

10:16.542 --> 10:18.291
-Yes.

10:19.250 --> 10:20.458
But?

10:21.834 --> 10:24.625
Okay, it's just, I was

10:21.834 --> 10:24.625
watching you two last night

10:24.667 --> 10:27.625
and he was kissing you

10:24.667 --> 10:27.625
and rubbing your back...

10:27.667 --> 10:28.792
Yeah?

10:28.834 --> 10:30.709
And it seemed kind of one-way.

10:30.750 --> 10:32.709
I was affectionate.

10:30.750 --> 10:32.709
I tickled his nose.

10:32.750 --> 10:34.417
Yeah, Gerald and I

10:32.750 --> 10:34.417
couldn't figure out

10:34.458 --> 10:35.625
what you were going for.

10:35.667 --> 10:38.041
(CHUCKLES) What?

10:35.667 --> 10:38.041
It was just a nose tickle.

10:38.083 --> 10:39.750
You keep saying that

10:38.083 --> 10:39.750
like it's a thing.

10:40.750 --> 10:41.834
What are you doing?

10:41.875 --> 10:43.667
See, that's a

10:41.875 --> 10:43.667
normal response.

10:43.709 --> 10:46.375
-Alex didn't complain.

10:43.709 --> 10:46.375
-'Cause he likes you.

10:47.166 --> 10:49.291
He's a seven

10:47.166 --> 10:49.291
on the touchy-feely scale.

10:49.333 --> 10:50.959
You've got to

10:49.333 --> 10:50.959
at least hit a five.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.583
-What number am I now?

10:51.000 --> 10:54.583
-Three. Yeah.

10:54.625 --> 10:55.834
When you've had

10:54.625 --> 10:55.834
some more drinks in you,

10:55.875 --> 10:57.375
you're, like, a four.

10:57.417 --> 10:59.667
Unless you had tequila.

10:57.417 --> 10:59.667
Then you drop down to one.

10:59.709 --> 11:01.625
(BOTH LAUGH)

11:01.667 --> 11:03.834
I don't want to be

11:01.667 --> 11:03.834
all over him.

11:03.875 --> 11:05.542
I don't think

11:03.875 --> 11:05.542
there's a risk of that.

11:13.166 --> 11:14.875
(GRUNTING) Thank you.

11:17.333 --> 11:19.667
-Anything else?

11:17.333 --> 11:19.667
-No, thank you.

11:22.208 --> 11:24.125
-Mr Kim?

11:22.208 --> 11:24.125
-Yeah.

11:24.834 --> 11:26.458
It's too much.

11:26.500 --> 11:30.333
It's a lot, yes.

11:26.500 --> 11:30.333
But <i> subeesu </i> is <i> subeesu.</i>

11:30.792 --> 11:33.625
Look. I know I've got

11:30.792 --> 11:33.625
a lot of stuff here,

11:33.667 --> 11:36.291
but don't worry,

11:33.667 --> 11:36.291
it's taken care of.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.667
-Jesus pay?

11:37.000 --> 11:39.667
-No, I pay. Later.

11:40.250 --> 11:41.583
I've been paying your wife.

11:41.625 --> 11:44.166
I just wasn't comfortable

11:41.625 --> 11:44.166
with <i> subeesu,</i>

11:44.208 --> 11:45.583
so we made an arrangement.

11:46.625 --> 11:48.000
Mrs Kim sneak attack.

11:49.500 --> 11:53.625
Uh, no, not sneak attack.

11:49.500 --> 11:53.625
Just... I wasn't comfortable.

11:53.667 --> 11:55.417
Mrs Kim sneak attack.

11:55.458 --> 11:58.375
-It was my idea.

11:55.458 --> 11:58.375
-That what she make you think.

11:58.417 --> 12:02.250
Mrs Kim is very smart

11:58.417 --> 12:02.250
sneak attack. Almost best.

12:03.667 --> 12:04.959
Almost.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.083
Look, I know I should have

12:05.000 --> 12:07.083
said something earlier.

12:07.125 --> 12:08.500
I just...

12:08.959 --> 12:10.500
I don't want to

12:08.959 --> 12:10.500
cause any friction

12:10.542 --> 12:11.750
between you and your wife.

12:11.792 --> 12:15.166
No, no. I not angry

12:11.792 --> 12:15.166
at you or Mrs Kim.

12:15.208 --> 12:17.166
And I agree with you both.

12:17.208 --> 12:19.250
People should pay

12:17.208 --> 12:19.250
for what they take.

12:20.083 --> 12:23.166
Everybody should pay.

12:20.083 --> 12:23.166
Everybody.

12:42.333 --> 12:44.250
-What?

12:42.333 --> 12:44.250
-What "what"?

12:46.500 --> 12:48.583
You look like

12:46.500 --> 12:48.583
you doing something.

12:49.250 --> 12:52.375
I know about you arrangement

12:49.250 --> 12:52.375
with Pastor Nina.

12:54.583 --> 12:56.458
She want to pay.

12:56.500 --> 12:57.792
-I know.

12:56.500 --> 12:57.792
-(COINS CLINKING)

12:57.834 --> 13:01.166
It's good idea.

12:57.834 --> 13:01.166
I want her to pay.

13:01.792 --> 13:03.875
I want everybody to pay.

13:04.667 --> 13:11.583
That's why I give Pastor Choi

13:04.667 --> 13:11.583
invoice for 72 Dentyne gum,

13:11.625 --> 13:15.917
44 Mars bar,

13:11.625 --> 13:15.917
and two box Ritz cookie.

13:18.125 --> 13:19.458
When you do this?

13:19.500 --> 13:22.417
Just now. In that envelope.

13:29.125 --> 13:32.959
Excuse, excuse,

13:29.125 --> 13:32.959
excuse, excuse...

13:33.375 --> 13:36.083
Excuse, excuse, excuse...

13:39.250 --> 13:42.208
Excuse, excuse, excuse...

13:42.834 --> 13:45.333
Excuse, excuse, excuse...

13:47.709 --> 13:50.417
What you think of

13:47.709 --> 13:50.417
my arrangement?

13:52.000 --> 13:53.500
Don't overreact.

13:59.083 --> 14:00.917
Okay, okay. <i> Aeeshcham.</i>

14:01.583 --> 14:04.959
BOTH: Excuse, excuse,

14:01.583 --> 14:04.959
excuse, excuse...

14:06.166 --> 14:08.125
SHANNON: Mind if I join you?

14:09.625 --> 14:12.208
Don't you love the Sunday

14:09.625 --> 14:12.208
shift? It's so quiet.

14:12.250 --> 14:14.041
Yeah, makes you wonder

14:12.250 --> 14:14.041
why we even open.

14:14.792 --> 14:16.834
So, what are we talking about?

14:17.125 --> 14:18.250
I just found out

14:18.291 --> 14:19.667
that my sister's dating

14:18.291 --> 14:19.667
a friend of mine.

14:19.709 --> 14:22.000
Which is just wrong.

14:19.709 --> 14:22.000
Tell him, Shannon.

14:22.041 --> 14:24.291
-Is your friend a good guy?

14:22.041 --> 14:24.291
-Yeah. He's a great guy.

14:24.917 --> 14:27.125
Okay. When I was

14:24.917 --> 14:27.125
in high school,

14:27.166 --> 14:28.291
there was this guy

14:27.166 --> 14:28.291
that was dating

14:28.333 --> 14:29.834
a friend of mine's sister.

14:29.875 --> 14:32.917
But the guy's brother really

14:29.875 --> 14:32.917
didn't like my friend's sister

14:32.959 --> 14:35.250
and eventually,

14:32.959 --> 14:35.250
he made them break up.

14:35.291 --> 14:37.166
And the reason

14:35.291 --> 14:37.166
I'm telling you this is,

14:37.542 --> 14:39.667
that guy is me.

14:40.917 --> 14:42.458
Are you telling us

14:40.917 --> 14:42.458
you used to be a guy?

14:42.917 --> 14:45.041
No, at first I thought

14:42.917 --> 14:45.041
it was too personal,

14:45.083 --> 14:47.959
so I tried to pretend

14:45.083 --> 14:47.959
it was about somebody else.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.750
I don't know

14:48.000 --> 14:49.750
why I made me a guy.

14:50.291 --> 14:51.458
Anyway, halfway through,

14:50.291 --> 14:51.458
I thought,

14:51.500 --> 14:52.875
"Jung and Kimchee are friends.

14:52.917 --> 14:54.625
"I can tell them

14:52.917 --> 14:54.625
this is about me."

14:54.667 --> 14:57.041
And I thought, "Finish first,

14:54.667 --> 14:57.041
tell them after,"

14:57.083 --> 14:58.834
which brings us to now.

14:59.250 --> 15:01.291
My point is, you have to

14:59.250 --> 15:01.291
follow your heart,

15:01.333 --> 15:03.583
and if your sister's happy,

15:01.333 --> 15:03.583
you should be happy.

15:03.625 --> 15:05.083
I am. It's just...

15:05.709 --> 15:08.000
It's just a little weird.

15:05.709 --> 15:08.000
But I don't want it to be.

15:08.500 --> 15:09.750
Which is why

15:08.500 --> 15:09.750
I invited them over

15:09.792 --> 15:10.959
to the basketball tonight.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.375
What? Tonight is Nacho Sunday.

15:13.417 --> 15:15.083
Theme nights are so fun.

15:15.125 --> 15:18.083
At my old branch, we used

15:15.125 --> 15:18.083
to have Fondue Fridays.

15:18.125 --> 15:19.500
It wasn't very good

15:18.125 --> 15:19.500
during flu season.

15:19.542 --> 15:22.083
Nacho Sunday is sacred

15:19.542 --> 15:22.083
Jungchee time.

15:22.125 --> 15:25.083
-"Jungchee?"

15:22.125 --> 15:25.083
-Point is, it's our thing.

15:25.125 --> 15:26.458
We've done it, like, twice.

15:26.500 --> 15:28.125
You should have

15:26.500 --> 15:28.125
asked me first.

15:28.166 --> 15:29.083
He's probably right.

15:30.250 --> 15:32.709
Fine, is it all right

15:30.250 --> 15:32.709
if Janet and Alex

15:32.750 --> 15:34.500
join us for Nacho Sunday?

15:34.542 --> 15:36.333
Thank you for asking. No.

15:38.333 --> 15:40.875
Well, I already asked them

15:38.333 --> 15:40.875
and they're coming, so...

15:40.917 --> 15:43.750
I already told you, you should

15:40.917 --> 15:43.750
have asked me first, so...

15:43.792 --> 15:45.667
Too late,

15:43.792 --> 15:45.667
they're coming, so...

15:47.250 --> 15:48.750
Stop! Stop! Stop!

15:48.792 --> 15:50.291
Mr Kim, no one is allowed

15:48.792 --> 15:50.291
to come in here.

15:50.333 --> 15:51.542
I make a mistake.

15:51.583 --> 15:54.291
I put library card

15:51.583 --> 15:54.291
in envelope. By accident.

15:54.917 --> 15:57.250
(LAUGHS) Oh, I do that

15:54.917 --> 15:57.250
all the time.

15:57.291 --> 15:58.500
You can't be in here, Mr Kim.

15:58.542 --> 16:00.458
When you bus break down,

16:00.500 --> 16:03.750
who drive all the way up to

16:00.500 --> 16:03.750
Casino Rama and pick you up?
