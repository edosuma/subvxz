AND NOW HERE I AM, I'M
COMPLETELY SCREWING UP.

40:04.276 --> 40:05.611
I'M HURTING PEOPLE.

40:05.611 --> 40:07.154
WHAT ARE YOU FEELING?

40:07.154 --> 40:10.282
JUST QUIT TRYING TO BREAK IT
DOWN LIKE IT'S A CASE.

40:14.286 --> 40:15.955
DO YOU WANT TO HAVE A BABY?

40:20.292 --> 40:23.963
JUST WHEN I THINK I DO
AND I COULD HANDLE IT,

40:23.963 --> 40:28.634
I'M HIT WITH THE THINGS WE DEAL
WITH EVERY DAY, THE PEOPLE,

40:28.634 --> 40:33.222
AND I THINK, "DO I WANT TO BRING
SOMEONE INTO THIS WORLD?"

40:33.222 --> 40:37.435
BUT YOU SEE, THAT'S ALL THE MORE
REASON FOR HAVING A BABY.

40:37.435 --> 40:41.605
WE CAN RAISE A CHILD WHO'LL GROW
UP TO BE A GOOD PERSON,

40:41.605 --> 40:44.900
SOMEONE TO HELP BALANCE OUT
ALL THE KILLERS

40:44.900 --> 40:46.694
AND RAPISTS AND THIEVES.

40:46.694 --> 40:49.905
I JUST DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN PULL IT OFF.

40:49.905 --> 40:51.157
WE COULD.

40:51.157 --> 40:55.619
WE COULD RAISE A CHILD TOGETHER,
VALERIE.

40:55.619 --> 40:58.122
LET GO.
ACCEPT IT.

40:58.122 --> 40:59.915
THIS IS A GIFT.

40:59.915 --> 41:03.085
AND JUST BELIEVE
THAT WE CAN DO IT.

41:03.085 --> 41:04.295
YOU WANT TO?

41:04.295 --> 41:05.588
I DO.

41:05.588 --> 41:07.631
I REALLY DO.

41:07.631 --> 41:08.757
WITH ME?

41:08.757 --> 41:10.384
ONLY WITH YOU.

41:10.384 --> 41:12.970
UNLESS GREG IS AVAILABLE.

41:12.970 --> 41:14.555
[ LAUGHS ]

41:14.555 --> 41:16.515
[ SNIFFLES ]

41:16.515 --> 41:18.058
OKAY.

41:37.119 --> 41:38.829
THAT'S $3, PLEASE.

41:38.829 --> 41:41.123
I DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY
ON ME.

41:41.123 --> 41:43.834
YOU SEE HOW THIS WORKS?

41:43.834 --> 41:48.297
HOW I'M TAKING MONEY OUT OF MY
POCKET THAT I KNOW IS MINE,

41:48.297 --> 41:53.052
I COUNT IT, I HAND IT OVER,
AND I GET MY CHANGE BACK?

41:53.052 --> 41:54.637
SIMPLE.

41:54.637 --> 41:56.889
HARDY HAR HAR.

41:56.889 --> 41:58.182
WATCH IT.

41:58.182 --> 42:00.392
OH!
SORRY.

42:00.392 --> 42:04.522
I FORGOT HOW MANY PEOPLE THERE
ARE HERE, THE BUSTLE.

42:04.522 --> 42:05.856
A LOT OF FOLKS.

42:05.856 --> 42:08.567
THANK YOU.

42:10.569 --> 42:15.491
IT IS AMAZING WHAT THEY CALL
ANTIQUES NOWADAYS.

42:15.491 --> 42:18.827
I REMEMBER
BUYING THESE NEW.

42:18.827 --> 42:20.162
MM-HMM.

42:23.499 --> 42:27.753
YOU, UH, YOU CAN DO THIS.
YOU KNOW YOU CAN.

42:27.753 --> 42:30.839
DEFINITELY.
WE SHOULD DO THIS MORE OFTEN.

42:30.839 --> 42:35.052
MRS. HORNBY,
YOU DON'T NEED ME ANYMORE.

42:35.052 --> 42:36.512
YOU DON'T NEED TO PAY FOR
COMPANY.

42:36.512 --> 42:38.097
YOU NEED TO GET OUT.

42:38.097 --> 42:39.640
WHERE? HOW?

42:39.640 --> 42:40.724
YOU GOT FRIENDS?

42:40.724 --> 42:42.226
I HAVEN'T SEEN THEM IN --

42:42.226 --> 42:44.687
GIVE 'EM A CALL.
TAKE 'EM OUT FOR DINNER.

42:44.687 --> 42:47.565
YOU GOT MONEY, AND IT'S NOT
GOING ANYWHERE NOW.

42:47.565 --> 42:49.191
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN.

42:49.191 --> 42:50.776
WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF?

42:50.776 --> 42:54.154
DID YOU JUST GET USED TO KEEPING
YOURSELF LOCKED UP?

42:54.154 --> 42:55.239
I DON'T KNOW.

42:55.239 --> 42:56.323
SUSAN...

42:57.783 --> 43:00.369
GET YOUR ASS BACK OUT
INTO THE WORLD.

43:00.369 --> 43:03.914
WILL YOU COME OVER AND PLAY
CARDS SOMETIME?

43:03.914 --> 43:06.709
I'LL MEET YOU FOR A WALK THROUGH
THE PARK SOMETIME.

43:06.709 --> 43:08.168
THANK YOU.

43:08.168 --> 43:09.628
YOU'RE WELCOME.

43:12.506 --> 43:17.511
I REALLY DO LOVE THIS CITY.

43:17.511 --> 43:19.305
YEP.

43:19.305 --> 43:21.056
ME TOO.

43:44.788 --> 43:47.750
