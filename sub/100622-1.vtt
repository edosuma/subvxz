get her number.

05:24.073 --> 05:25.108
No.

05:25.175 --> 05:26.509
Yeah, it'd be a shame

the phone number in time.

05:51.800 --> 05:54.003

her real number?

05:54.070 --> 05:55.271

in the middle of summer
without complaint.

10:21.939 --> 10:24.240
It's about 100 degrees out.

10:24.307 --> 10:26.008
Oh, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna pass out.

10:26.075 --> 10:27.743
Well, you're about to
ruin Christmas

10:27.810 --> 10:29.512
for a bunch of kids, Sal.

10:29.579 --> 10:31.347
<i>Okay, Sal, when this kid
approaches, this is easy,</i>

10:31.414 --> 10:33.683
<i>just yell, "No! No!"</i>

10:33.749 --> 10:35.184
No! No!

10:35.251 --> 10:37.855
No.

10:37.921 --> 10:39.188
So what do you want, Aiden?

10:39.255 --> 10:40.723
Do you want a big toy
or a little toy?

10:40.790 --> 10:42.992
What would you like?
I'll get it for you right now.

10:43.059 --> 10:45.995
Lightning McQueen.

10:46.062 --> 10:47.163
- Sal, fall asleep.
- Fall asleep, Sal.

10:47.230 --> 10:48.598
Fall asleep, fall asleep.

10:52.134 --> 10:53.669
Santa?

10:53.736 --> 10:55.838
Sal's sleeping. Look at him.

10:55.906 --> 10:57.240
Look at the kid.

10:57.306 --> 10:59.742
- Sal fell asleep.
- The shot's insane, Sal.

11:01.077 --> 11:05.348
<i>Sal, stay there.</i>

11:05.414 --> 11:07.216
Head's... Head nod down
there more.

11:07.283 --> 11:08.451
<i>There you go.</i>

11:08.518 --> 11:11.287
<i>Big snores. Big...</i>

11:11.354 --> 11:13.322
Ooh!

11:13.389 --> 11:15.391
- <i>Start bouncing him.</i>
- Oh.

11:15.458 --> 11:17.226
- <i>"When'd you get here?"</i>
- <i>Higher, buddy, higher.</i>

11:17.293 --> 11:18.896
Yeah!

11:21.564 --> 11:24.033
<i>Oh, taking his leg off!
He's taking his leg off!</i>

11:24.100 --> 11:25.801
He's so happy.

11:33.409 --> 11:35.411
<i>Look at the...</i>

11:36.479 --> 11:37.713
High five!

11:37.780 --> 11:39.181
Aww.

11:40.283 --> 11:42.618
This fake snow
can't be helping.

11:43.954 --> 11:46.155
Hello, darling. How are you?

11:46.222 --> 11:49.292
Come sit on Santa's lap.

11:49.358 --> 11:51.394
- And what is your name?
- Casey.

11:51.460 --> 11:53.763
Casey, I want you
to take a minute

11:53.829 --> 11:56.967
and think about what you might
want for Christmas this year.

11:57.034 --> 11:58.334
Just think about it
in your head.

11:58.401 --> 12:00.169
- Okay?
- Uh...

12:01.370 --> 12:02.672
"Don't talk to me
till I tell you."

12:02.738 --> 12:05.141
Now, don't talk
until I tell you, Casey.

12:05.207 --> 12:06.642
- Mmm-hmm.
- Okay.

12:08.678 --> 12:13.716
"Now, why aren't you saying anything to Santa?"

12:13.783 --> 12:15.852
I don't have all day, Casey.
Do you know what you want?

12:15.919 --> 12:17.119
- Yes.
- Okay.

12:17.186 --> 12:18.889
Don't speak
until I tell you, now.

12:18.956 --> 12:20.423
<i>She's so cute.</i>

12:20.489 --> 12:21.757
Whenever you're ready,
just tell me what you want.

12:21.824 --> 12:22.926
<i>Keep flip-flopping.</i>

12:22.993 --> 12:23.826
But don't talk
until I tell you.

12:25.494 --> 12:27.129
Okay? So whenever you're ready,
you tell me what you want.

12:27.196 --> 12:30.132
But please don't speak
until I tell you.

12:30.199 --> 12:31.434
- Whenever you're ready.
- Okay.

12:31.500 --> 12:33.302
Just don't speak until I say.

12:35.939 --> 12:37.206
Nice to meet you...

12:37.273 --> 12:38.507
So, Sal, how was that?
You're doing...

12:38.574 --> 12:39.910
You're being a very good
horrible Santa.

12:39.977 --> 12:42.545
Guys, this...
It's torture for us all.

12:42.612 --> 12:44.447
It's a torture for me,
it's a torture for you,

12:44.513 --> 12:46.115
it's a torture
for the children.

12:46.182 --> 12:47.851
- I'm having a blast back here.
- Yeah.

12:47.918 --> 12:49.752
I'm giggling with my friends.
It feels pretty good back here.

12:49.819 --> 12:52.254
There's no less than 40
strands of hair in my mouth.

12:52.321 --> 12:53.789
<i>Oh, it's getting
worse, Sal.</i>

12:53.857 --> 12:57.727
<i>Oh!</i>

13:06.003 --> 13:09.305
Jingle, jingle.

13:10.941 --> 13:12.241
- Oh.
- I've had enough.

13:12.308 --> 13:13.175
I'm pulling the plug
on this whole thing.

13:13.242 --> 13:14.443
Let's get out of here.

13:14.510 --> 13:16.880
- <i>That's a cut.</i>
- <i>Nice work.</i>

13:35.464 --> 13:36.967
Where's the
Cheddar Bay Biscuits?

13:37.034 --> 13:38.501
I ordered a whole another
basket, like, ten minutes ago.

13:38.567 --> 13:40.070
- You already had six.
- So what?

13:40.137 --> 13:41.837
- You're cut off.
- You can't be cut off.

13:41.905 --> 13:43.706
It's unlimited, it's the
whole point of Red Lobster.

13:43.773 --> 13:45.174
Guys. Guys.

13:46.308 --> 13:48.979
- Is that Abdul?
- Kareem?

13:49.046 --> 13:50.646
No. Can't be.

13:50.713 --> 13:52.782
- That's Abdul. That's her.
- That's her.

13:52.848 --> 13:54.684
- Oh, my God.
- It is Abdul.

13:54.750 --> 13:57.020
I know Abdul when I see it.
It's her! I'm scared right now.

13:57.087 --> 13:59.355
My windpipe is still sore
from when she hit me.

13:59.422 --> 14:00.589
Yeah, she straight jacked you.

14:00.656 --> 14:02.159
She's gonna remember
that night.

14:02.224 --> 14:03.426
Oh, she's coming over here,
so it's curtains for us,

14:03.492 --> 14:04.727
essentially, it's what it is.

14:04.794 --> 14:06.595
- I gotta get out of here.
- No, no! Sit...

14:06.662 --> 14:07.396
Sit down.

14:07.463 --> 14:08.798
This is our Red Lobster.

14:08.865 --> 14:10.332
I've been training for this
for 20 years.

14:10.399 --> 14:12.601
Nobody touches you again.
Not on my watch.

14:12.668 --> 14:14.104
- Okay, thank you.
- No, yeah.

14:14.171 --> 14:15.638
- Just sit down.
- She's coming right over here.

14:15.705 --> 14:17.239
- Act casual.
- She's looking right at us.

14:17.306 --> 14:18.340
- Act casual.
- She's looking...

14:18.407 --> 14:20.209
Smile. Act natural.

14:20.276 --> 14:21.677
Smile. Smile.

14:23.279 --> 14:24.547
All right.

14:27.851 --> 14:29.251
Fifteen feet.

14:29.318 --> 14:30.820
Ten feet.

14:30.887 --> 14:31.988
Five feet.

14:32.055 --> 14:33.056
Abdul.

14:33.123 --> 14:34.423
You're the Impractical Jokers.

14:34.490 --> 14:36.392
- Yeah.
- For real?

14:36.459 --> 14:38.427
- Yeah.
- Holy shit.

14:38.494 --> 14:41.363
- Okay.
- I love you guys.

14:41.430 --> 14:44.233
Oh, no joke, man.
I've watched every season.

14:44.300 --> 14:46.435
Well, except for season five.

14:46.502 --> 14:47.536
Yeah, I don't want
to get into it.

14:47.603 --> 14:49.072
All right, well, thank you.

14:49.139 --> 14:51.407
By any chance, you guys
gonna be in Miami next week?

14:51.474 --> 14:53.375
- Yeah.
- I'm having this huge party.

14:53.442 --> 14:55.311
You guys can come.
You can hang one night.

14:55.377 --> 14:57.047
You can hang the weekend.
Go hang out.

14:57.114 --> 14:58.347
- Oh, my God.
- What?

14:58.414 --> 14:59.715
You kidding me?

14:59.782 --> 15:01.184
Yeah, we'll be there.
We were gonna go...

15:01.250 --> 15:02.618
- We were going anyway.
- Yeah! Yeah!

15:02.685 --> 15:04.320
Yes!

15:04.386 --> 15:06.756
Sam? Hook 'em up.

15:10.459 --> 15:13.496
- Season five was atrocious.
- Mmm.

15:13.562 --> 15:15.331
So I'll see you in Miami?

15:15.397 --> 15:16.332
Yes!
Yeah, I'll see you there.

15:16.398 --> 15:17.934
This is crazy.

15:18.001 --> 15:19.535
Yeah, that's right.
We are so in Miami.

15:19.602 --> 15:20.971
- We'll see you there.
- All right.

15:21.037 --> 15:23.305
- Miami, here we come.
- All right.

15:23.372 --> 15:24.673
We're not really going
to Miami, are we?

15:24.740 --> 15:25.841
- Of course we're going to Miami.
- No.

15:25.909 --> 15:27.476
That night
was a disaster. Okay?

15:27.543 --> 15:29.612
We have a chance here
for a do-over.

15:29.678 --> 15:32.515
I don't need a do-over.
I'm the victim, okay?

15:32.581 --> 15:33.950
She punched me in the throat.

15:34.017 --> 15:35.818
Guys, this isn't even
a discussion, okay?

15:35.886 --> 15:38.487
Abdul is here in the Lobster,
she invites us to the party,

15:38.554 --> 15:40.056
we go to the party.

15:40.123 --> 15:42.324
We turn back the clock.
We put that disaster to bed.

15:42.391 --> 15:43.860
Oh, yeah.
We're going, and this time,

15:43.927 --> 15:45.962
we're gonna prove that
we're not gonna screw it up.

15:46.029 --> 15:47.964
That's right.
With a little bit of hype.

15:48.031 --> 15:49.532
- Mmm.
- No hype.

15:49.598 --> 15:51.201
- A little bit.
- Mmm. No.

15:51.268 --> 15:52.468
All right,
the appropriate amount.

15:52.535 --> 15:53.937
Hmm, no. Less.

15:54.004 --> 15:56.039
Do this. That.

15:56.106 --> 15:58.307
Oh, I'm bringing this much,
and if we use it, we use it.

15:58.374 --> 16:00.409
Oh, my God, there's only three.

16:00.476 --> 16:01.677
There's only three laminates.

16:01.744 --> 16:03.445
Perfect. I'm out. God's plan.

16:03.512 --> 16:04.915
No, no, no.
What are you talking about?

16:04.981 --> 16:07.349
We'll settle this the way
we do every big decision

16:07.416 --> 16:08.985
in our life, okay?

16:09.052 --> 16:10.619
The four of us will compete
in hidden camera challenges

16:10.686 --> 16:12.022
on the way down to Miami,

16:12.088 --> 16:14.490
and the loser does not
go to that party.

16:17.593 --> 16:19.129
- Road trip, guys!
- Let's do it.

16:19.196 --> 16:20.329
Let's just get in the car
and do it.

16:20.396 --> 16:21.564
- Road trip, baby.
- Yeah!

16:21.630 --> 16:23.233
Guys, I have the perfect car.

16:23.300 --> 16:25.035
- You guys are gonna love this.
- Oh, thank God, yes.

16:25.101 --> 16:27.703
Every part of my body
is rejecting this plan.

16:27.770 --> 16:28.838
Who pays the bill, by the way?

16:28.905 --> 16:31.208
I pay the bill? I pay the bill?

16:42.751 --> 16:43.619
Huh?

16:44.587 --> 16:46.089
- Shotgun.
- What? No!

16:46.156 --> 16:47.690
Yeah, I saw it, and I said it.

16:47.756 --> 16:49.025
- That's not even right.
- Yeah, that's the rule.

16:49.092 --> 16:50.426
I get carsick.
I can't sit back there.

16:50.492 --> 16:51.694
Your carsick is not my problem.

16:51.760 --> 16:52.963
- No.
- Will you guys...

16:53.029 --> 16:54.064
Please, please,
can you veto this?

16:54.130 --> 16:55.165
I will vomit everywhere.

16:55.232 --> 16:56.398
Veto it? Why would I veto that?

16:56.465 --> 16:57.833
It's the rules of shotgun.

16:57.901 --> 16:59.535
You see the car, you say,
"Shotgun," you sit there.

16:59.602 --> 17:01.370
Joe gets shotgun
'cause he respects the leather.

17:01.437 --> 17:02.538
- Thank you, sir.
- Hey, what...

17:02.605 --> 17:04.107
Whatever gave you
the impression

17:04.174 --> 17:05.808
- I didn't respect it?
- You scuffed the leather, man.

17:05.876 --> 17:08.644
That's like punching
Grandma Lucia in her face.

17:08.711 --> 17:10.113
She killed herself
in the back left seat, right?

17:10.180 --> 17:12.514
Why don't we all get off
our high horses here?

17:12.581 --> 17:13.782
All right, it's not
that great of a car.

17:13.849 --> 17:15.517
- It's not a Corvette.
- No, I know.

17:15.584 --> 17:17.120
It's a Crown Vic.
I know what this car is.

17:17.187 --> 17:18.955
I mean, it's the vehicular
equivalent of Baltic Avenue.

17:19.022 --> 17:20.056
Baltic Avenue?

17:20.123 --> 17:21.657
What are you,
going Monopoly on me?

17:21.724 --> 17:23.692
You're the thimble.
Yeah, and do not pass go.

17:23.759 --> 17:25.761
You go directly
to the back seat, buddy.

17:25.828 --> 17:27.830
I feel like
I'm being sandbagged.

17:27.898 --> 17:29.698
Question, should I take
a quick shit here or should I...

17:29.765 --> 17:31.634
- Would you guys just get in the car already?
- Okay.

- Oh, you got that Megaballs?

18:34.431 --> 18:35.899

collection of jazz, smooth.

- Oh.
- Ooh.

18:49.611 --> 18:51.114
- Let me ask you guys something.
- Hmm?

18:51.181 --> 18:52.949
You guys ever wonder
what Murray gets up to

18:53.016 --> 18:55.018
- when we're not with him?
- I would love to know.

18:55.085 --> 18:56.552
We've been friends with him
my whole life.

18:56.618 --> 18:58.221
I go to sleep
wondering what he does.

18:58.288 --> 19:00.156
- Hmm.
- I got ideas.

19:00.223 --> 19:01.291
- Yeah?
- Tell me.

19:01.358 --> 19:02.624
- He traveled a lot.
- Yeah.

19:02.691 --> 19:04.526
That time he went
on that tour with Yanni

19:04.593 --> 19:06.162
in South America.

19:06.229 --> 19:07.763
The Rainbows to Rainforest
Tour, I remember that.

19:07.830 --> 19:09.366
Yeah, but he kept
using air quotes with that.

19:09.432 --> 19:10.733
- He did that with you?
- Yeah,

19:10.799 --> 19:13.103
like, "If you need me,
I'll be with Yanni

19:13.169 --> 19:14.437
in South America."

19:14.536 --> 19:15.838
Now, what does that mean?

19:15.905 --> 19:18.041
Every part of that sentence
is a fallacy?

19:19.442 --> 19:20.609
"I-I'll be unavailable."

19:20.676 --> 19:21.911
- Whoa.
- What is that?

19:21.978 --> 19:23.480
It's air quotes.
We're all doing it.

19:23.545 --> 19:24.948
- No, no, no. What's that?
- Unavailable. It's air quotes.

19:25.015 --> 19:26.449
You're not calling
four people over,

19:26.515 --> 19:27.516
you gotta flip that
and reverse it.

19:27.583 --> 19:28.751
Oh, all right, Missy Elliott.

19:28.817 --> 19:30.053
- I wasn't sure. Got it.
- Fellas?

19:30.120 --> 19:31.520
- Yo?
- Got it.

19:33.555 --> 19:35.959
Right? For the road.
For the road?

19:36.026 --> 19:37.027
Right?

19:38.761 --> 19:39.762
I don't need him.

19:53.642 --> 19:55.178
DC, baby.

19:57.846 --> 19:59.315
<i>So today,
we're stopping people</i>

19:59.382 --> 20:00.783
<i>and telling them
we gotta speak at a memorial.</i>

20:00.849 --> 20:02.651
The only thing is that
we've written...

20:02.718 --> 20:04.187
- Each other's.
- Each other's eulogies.

20:04.254 --> 20:05.687
So, at the end,
we'll have to ask them,

20:05.754 --> 20:07.190
"Do you think it's fit to say?"

20:07.257 --> 20:10.193
And if they say no, we lose.
If they say yes, we win.

20:10.260 --> 20:12.062
It's a sad day.

20:13.530 --> 20:16.900
This just shows you
how fleeting life is, guys.

20:16.966 --> 20:18.101
<i>How about this old guy?</i>

20:19.035 --> 20:20.636
You got the right idea.

20:20.702 --> 20:22.539
- Ooh, too many steps.
- Can't handle it.

20:22.604 --> 20:24.074
You just, you guys
are in town just visiting

20:24.140 --> 20:25.774
- for the tours, the sights?
- Yeah.

20:25.841 --> 20:27.210
<i>Look at the urn.</i>

20:27.277 --> 20:28.912
I'm in town, unfortunately,
for sad reasons.

20:28.978 --> 20:30.712
- Got a, um...
- Bucket of ashes right here.

20:30.779 --> 20:32.248
- I'm giving the eulogy.
- Oh.

20:32.315 --> 20:33.749
Yeah, at a funeral.

20:33.816 --> 20:35.717
He got a great mark.
This guy's so into the idea.

20:35.784 --> 20:38.121
We're doing the thing by the water
and spreading the ashes, you know.

20:38.188 --> 20:39.522
Oh, yeah.

20:39.588 --> 20:41.357
.,<It's kinda why people come
to the reflection pools.

20:41.424 --> 20:43.026
Is that why people come
to the reflection pool, though?

20:43.093 --> 20:44.726
I'm pretty sure you're not
allowed to even do that.

20:44.793 --> 20:45.962
Can I run the eulogy by you?
It takes one second.

20:46.029 --> 20:47.163
It's only
a couple sentences long.

20:47.230 --> 20:49.332
You're very brave
for doing that.

20:49.399 --> 20:50.699
Here's the eulogy I wrote.

20:50.766 --> 20:52.502
"Grandma."

20:52.569 --> 20:53.802
"Grandma was...

20:53.870 --> 20:55.704
Grandma was
a straight up bitch."

20:57.673 --> 20:59.876
"You know it, Grandpa.
We all know it.

20:59.943 --> 21:01.144
And now she's dead

21:01.211 --> 21:03.046
and we've got
her goddamn money.

21:03.113 --> 21:04.813
Let's go to China Buffet
to celebrate

21:04.881 --> 21:06.449
this bitch's
one-way ticket to hell."

21:06.516 --> 21:07.749
Wow.

21:07.816 --> 21:08.952
What do you think?
Is it ready to go?

21:10.553 --> 21:12.956
I don't know what other
people would think about that.

21:13.022 --> 21:14.524
We all felt this way
about Grandma.

21:14.591 --> 21:15.558
- Oh.
- We all did.

21:15.624 --> 21:17.260
Including Grandpa.

21:17.327 --> 21:18.561
So you think I should just read
this or should I change it?

21:18.627 --> 21:19.996
I don't... I wouldn't.

21:20.063 --> 21:21.264
- You wouldn't read it?
- No.

21:21.331 --> 21:23.566
Oh!

21:23.632 --> 21:24.567
I'm not good
with public speaking.

21:24.633 --> 21:25.734
Forget the urn. Walk away.

21:25.801 --> 21:27.103
All right.
Well, take care, sir.

21:27.170 --> 21:28.837
- Have a great vacation. Enjoy.
- Yeah.

21:28.905 --> 21:30.507
- Take care, now.
- You bet.

21:30.573 --> 21:31.574
What do you want with this?

21:34.477 --> 21:35.811
Sir?

21:46.523 --> 21:48.158
Guys, can I ask you a question?

21:48.224 --> 21:49.259
Here we go.

21:49.325 --> 21:50.894
It's just a few words.
I'm very nervous.

21:50.960 --> 21:52.562
Can I read it to you
just to say it out loud

21:52.629 --> 21:54.097
- and tell me if you like it?
- Sure.

21:54.164 --> 21:55.731
I'm so nervous.
The family's meeting me. Yeah.

21:55.797 --> 21:58.535
Okay, uh,
"Thank you all for coming

21:58.601 --> 22:01.871
to the spreading of the ashes
of Joey Dumps."

22:01.938 --> 22:03.206
- Joey Dumps.
- Joey Dumps.

22:03.273 --> 22:04.974
"What could be said
about Joey Dumps?

22:05.041 --> 22:06.509
He took his lumps."

22:08.178 --> 22:09.546
"Joey Dumps was there for me.

22:09.612 --> 22:11.147
He let me see those dumps.

22:11.214 --> 22:13.049
Dumps-da-dumps-dumps-dumps."

22:13.116 --> 22:14.284
"When you were down
in the dumps,

22:14.350 --> 22:16.019
who was there for you...
Joey Dumps.

22:16.085 --> 22:17.487
Dumps like a truck,
truck, truck."

22:18.922 --> 22:20.924
"Guys like a what, what, what.

22:20.990 --> 22:24.661
So to honor his last wish,
we now dump Dumps' ashes,

22:24.726 --> 22:26.529
and then go listen
to the final episode

22:26.596 --> 22:28.364
of his baseball-themed
podcast,

22:28.431 --> 22:31.434
'Joey Dumps Humps Chump Umps
in the Rumps.'"

22:33.403 --> 22:35.939
- <i>It's so Joey Dumps.</i>
- It's very Joey Dumps.

22:36.005 --> 22:37.706
- Do you think it...
- It's very funny.

22:37.773 --> 22:39.876
- Should I change anything?
- No.

22:39.943 --> 22:41.444
- No? Ah.
- Oh!

22:41.511 --> 22:43.845
- It's a great memorial.
- Thank you very much.

22:43.913 --> 22:45.682
- I appreciate you guys.
- Thank you. Good luck.

22:45.747 --> 22:47.550
- Thank you.
- He was a big Sisqó fan.

22:47.617 --> 22:48.985
Wow. Ready to go.

22:49.052 --> 22:51.588
- Good job with that, Sal.
- Sal with a W.

22:51.654 --> 22:52.821
My eulogy game, I crush.

22:52.889 --> 22:54.023
I give a good eulogy.

22:57.393 --> 22:58.561
You guys ready?

22:58.628 --> 23:00.163
<i>Yeah, the cameras
aren't on, but...</i>

23:00.230 --> 23:01.297
How we doing?
Cameras aren't ready yet?

23:01.364 --> 23:02.932
Guys, the secret is to...

23:04.300 --> 23:07.537
pique interest,
pique the curiosity of people.

23:07.604 --> 23:09.606
Could you just hold this up,
and I'm just gonna...

23:09.672 --> 23:11.341
Yeah, just hold that up,
yeah, like that, it's perfect.

23:13.009 --> 23:14.877
They're holding ashes.

23:14.944 --> 23:16.179
There we go. That's great.

23:16.246 --> 23:17.779
- Yeah, I'm here for a memorial.
- Oh.

23:17.846 --> 23:21.017
So I'm about to give
a eulogy, um, about this.

23:21.084 --> 23:22.685
So I'm just getting prepared.

23:22.751 --> 23:24.387
You mind if I just say it out
loud to you guys real quick?

23:24.454 --> 23:26.489
- Sure. Go on.
- Yeah. Hold her. Thanks.

23:26.556 --> 23:27.657
<i>Okay.</i>

23:27.724 --> 23:28.691
Sometimes he makes it
look easy.

23:28.757 --> 23:30.792
"This that eulogy. You know.

23:30.860 --> 23:32.695
You know what it is,
gang, gang.

23:32.761 --> 23:34.731
Devin died. He got got."

23:36.032 --> 23:37.467
"He got shot. He loved life.

23:37.533 --> 23:38.901
He loved wife, my wife.

23:38.968 --> 23:41.204
I shot that mother.
Eleven shots in the leg."

23:41.271 --> 23:42.905
- In the leg?
- "I ain't supposed to be here,

23:42.972 --> 23:44.741
but y'all know what?
Y'all can scratch.

23:44.806 --> 23:46.609
I came here
to see him put down

23:46.676 --> 23:47.710
- and piss on the grave."
- Oh!

23:49.778 --> 23:52.415
That's when I would take...
Expose myself and start peeing.

23:52.482 --> 23:54.150
- "Expose myself and..."
- And then remember

23:54.217 --> 23:56.085
to drink a lot of water prior,
as a note to myself.

23:56.152 --> 23:58.621
And then escape out
the southeast exit...

23:58.688 --> 24:00.023
- <i>Escape.</i>
- Of the cemetery.

24:00.089 --> 24:01.457
And it's a right on red.

24:02.659 --> 24:03.960
<i>So that's how I would do that.</i>

24:04.027 --> 24:05.862
- Way too extreme.
- Is it too extreme?

24:05.928 --> 24:08.398
Oh!

24:08.464 --> 24:09.632
Yes!

24:09.699 --> 24:11.100
I should probably just say
he was a good guy.

24:11.167 --> 24:12.602
Yeah, just probably...
Yeah, yeah.

24:12.669 --> 24:13.703
I think that's all.
That's why you're MC, yeah.

24:13.770 --> 24:14.836
So not good to go, then.

24:21.611 --> 24:24.013
<i>Here goes Q. He looks good.
He's all cleaned up.</i>

24:24.080 --> 24:25.415
- <i>Q always looks good.</i>
- Take a picture?

24:25.481 --> 24:28.851
- Yeah, no problem.
- Here you go, Q, you're in.

24:28.918 --> 24:30.453
Got it. There you go.
Thank you.

24:30.520 --> 24:33.423
Thanks, I'm, uh, doing
a eulogy, actually.

24:33.489 --> 24:35.824
We're supposed to dump
the ashes in here,

24:35.892 --> 24:37.293
but it turns out
you're not allowed to.

24:37.360 --> 24:38.795
Do you mind if I run
the speech by you?

24:38.861 --> 24:40.797
'Cause I'm super nervous.
It's super short.

24:40.863 --> 24:42.965
"What to say
about Cousin Frieda?

24:43.966 --> 24:45.368
Sure, she had loose morals

24:45.435 --> 24:48.004
and a libido that wouldn't
quit, and that's..."

24:48.805 --> 24:49.872
- How old are you?
- 13.

24:49.939 --> 24:52.075
13? All right, cool.

24:52.141 --> 24:54.711
I'm good.

24:54.777 --> 24:57.046
That's it. You're out.

24:57.113 --> 25:00.249
It's all about how she died
'cause of STDs.

25:11.761 --> 25:13.296
- Gettin' up.
- Ready to go.

25:24.574 --> 25:26.909
- Can you guys humor me?
- Always.

25:28.144 --> 25:29.712
Can we find a cave?

25:32.014 --> 25:33.216
Don't ask.

25:33.282 --> 25:35.551
- Wait, it depends, for who.
- You.

25:38.221 --> 25:42.225
This, I mean, this idea
basically was a layup for us.

25:42.291 --> 25:44.026
Just how do we make
Joe's stupid face

25:44.093 --> 25:45.294
look even more stupid?

25:45.361 --> 25:48.831
The conceit here
is Joe lost his tour

25:48.898 --> 25:50.800
about three decades ago.

25:50.868 --> 25:53.336
And he's been living
under the earth ever since.

25:53.403 --> 25:56.239
Middle of the summer,
when it's 110 degrees outside,

25:56.305 --> 25:58.107
this is the place to be,
I'll tell you that.

25:58.174 --> 25:59.976
When you guys see Joe
for the first time,

26:00.042 --> 26:01.544
that's the first time
we're seeing Joe.

26:01.611 --> 26:02.779
I can't wait for this.

26:02.845 --> 26:03.881
So as we're coming
through here,

26:03.946 --> 26:05.281
kind of look along the ceiling.

26:05.348 --> 26:07.049
We got lots
of these little divots.

26:07.116 --> 26:09.018
Here we go.

26:09.085 --> 26:10.586
You'll notice these cracks.

26:10.653 --> 26:13.456
That's the water movement
when all this was underwater.

26:13.523 --> 26:14.657
Hello?

26:14.724 --> 26:16.225
- Oh.
- Oh.

26:16.292 --> 26:19.195
- Yo.
- Oh, hey, man.

26:19.262 --> 26:20.596
Oh.

26:20.663 --> 26:24.033
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. What's up?

26:25.968 --> 26:28.337
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

26:29.806 --> 26:32.742
<i>Look at their faces.
They're shocked.</i>

26:32.809 --> 26:35.011
Oh, my God. For real, though?

26:35.077 --> 26:36.779
That's freakin' me out.

26:36.846 --> 26:37.980
It's freakin' you out?

26:38.047 --> 26:39.215
Imagine what this is like
for me.

26:39.282 --> 26:40.483
You all right, dude?

26:40.550 --> 26:41.717
No, I've been
to too many movies.

26:41.784 --> 26:42.853
Oh, he's gross.

26:42.920 --> 26:44.888
I got lost
a little while ago.

26:44.954 --> 26:46.155
Hey.

26:46.222 --> 26:47.457
I didn't think he was...
I didn't think

26:47.523 --> 26:49.058
he was gonna come out
of this cave.

26:49.125 --> 26:51.694
I was waiting for my parents.

26:51.761 --> 26:53.396
I've been down here since 1987.

26:55.198 --> 26:56.632
Dad said,
"Don't have a cow, man.

26:56.699 --> 26:57.733
Talk to the hand."

26:57.800 --> 27:00.069
And I was here...

27:00.136 --> 27:01.637
I got all turned around.

27:01.704 --> 27:04.106
What happened was I was looking
for the gift shop...

27:05.074 --> 27:06.442
It's on down the left.

27:08.044 --> 27:10.012
I went on my ass
to the left here...

27:10.079 --> 27:11.380
I like your shirt.

27:11.447 --> 27:13.483
I'm the beef.

27:13.549 --> 27:15.751
Joe, be proud
of your "I'm the Beef" shirt.

27:15.818 --> 27:17.855
- Back of...
- I'm the beef.

27:17.921 --> 27:20.256
<i>I'm the beef.</i>

27:20.323 --> 27:21.491
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to interrupt.

27:21.557 --> 27:23.159
- I'll just fold in.
- Oh, okay.

27:23.226 --> 27:25.228
Well, the water...

27:25.294 --> 27:26.796
Again, the water
that moves through it,

27:26.864 --> 27:28.531
that just opens up the cave.

27:28.598 --> 27:30.800
So this water,
usually, with the rain,

27:30.868 --> 27:32.034
<i>will come up over that way.</i>

27:32.101 --> 27:33.269
Y'all have any questions?

27:33.336 --> 27:34.303
I have...
I have a lot of questions.

27:34.370 --> 27:36.506
Uh, yeah. Go ahead.

27:36.572 --> 27:38.808
Let's start
with what year is it?

27:38.876 --> 27:41.344
- It's 2018, sir.
- Okay.

27:41.410 --> 27:44.514
Let me check my pager.

27:44.580 --> 27:46.984
Joe, have them fall in line
and walk in front of them

27:47.049 --> 27:48.484
- like you're a sergeant.
- Why don't you...

27:48.551 --> 27:50.286
Why don't you let me
just tell everybody?

27:50.353 --> 27:51.454
- <i>You're pissed at everybody.</i>
- This water comes every...

27:51.521 --> 27:52.788
Come on, Neil.

27:54.090 --> 27:55.424
This is what happened.

27:55.491 --> 27:57.093
You go up this ravine
and it's a dead end.

27:57.159 --> 28:00.796
- Goes up, like, 200 feet.
- 350 feet, Neil.

28:00.864 --> 28:03.332
Goes to 350 feet, okay?

28:03.399 --> 28:04.600
I mean, if you're gonna
talk out your ass,

28:04.667 --> 28:06.102
turn around
so I can understand you.

28:09.539 --> 28:11.407
<i>Anybody know who shot J.R.?</i>

28:11.474 --> 28:13.109
Do you guys know who shot J.R.?

28:15.411 --> 28:17.747
'Cause I missed...
J.R. from <i>Dallas.</i>

28:17.813 --> 28:18.982
I missed that.

28:19.048 --> 28:20.750
It's been on my mind
for so long.

28:20.816 --> 28:23.819
- Dad?
- Dad? What?

28:23.887 --> 28:25.821
I didn't say shit.

28:28.124 --> 28:30.027
You guys,
follow me out of here.

28:30.092 --> 28:31.227
I'm dying to get outside.

28:31.294 --> 28:32.528
Did Mondale get a second term?

28:32.595 --> 28:34.430
Did Mondale get a second term?

28:37.300 --> 28:40.403
Uh, okay, we're still
rolling here, guys.

28:41.837 --> 28:44.707
You fucking son of a bitch.
Oh, my God.

28:44.774 --> 28:47.143
Oh, my God.
It scared the shit out of me.

28:47.209 --> 28:48.711
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God!

28:57.453 --> 28:59.121
Turn up the tension.
Pedal, pedal.

28:59.188 --> 29:00.489
- Hey, bud, what's up?
- Hey.

29:00.556 --> 29:04.226
You, uh, have
a laptop charger or...

29:04.293 --> 29:05.661
Which one?
USB-C or the older ones?

29:05.728 --> 29:08.564
Let's go, ladies!
Keep it going!

29:08.631 --> 29:11.133
Work the quads,
work the glutes.

29:11.200 --> 29:12.468
Anyways, what can I do
for you, bud?

29:12.535 --> 29:14.337
- "Let's go, ladies"?
- Let's go, yeah.

29:14.403 --> 29:15.906
Who are these ladies?

29:15.973 --> 29:18.240
Do me a favor, keep 'em
encouraged while I'm gone.

29:20.676 --> 29:22.712
Let's go!

29:22.778 --> 29:25.048
You are doggin' it!
I want to see more out of you!

29:25.114 --> 29:26.382
You over there,
you're looking good.

29:26.449 --> 29:28.085
- Let's go!
- Sorry, that's too much.

29:28.150 --> 29:29.518
- That's too much.
- Yeah, I'm so sorry.

29:29.585 --> 29:30.854
I don't have the USB-C,
I have the older laptop,

29:30.921 --> 29:32.022
so I don't got it, bud.

29:32.089 --> 29:33.489
Good?

29:33.556 --> 29:34.958
- Did you...
- I haven't got it, okay?

29:35.025 --> 29:38.160
Come on, ladies!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

29:53.242 --> 29:55.344
<i>Q is on a boat
with a couple of strangers,</i>

29:55.411 --> 29:57.413
<i>and we've arranged
for this boat to pull up</i>

29:57.480 --> 29:58.882
<i>on someone in distress.</i>

29:58.949 --> 30:01.684
Q doesn't know who, how,
or what the situation is.

30:01.751 --> 30:03.753
<i>In that moment,
the captain's gonna say,</i>

30:03.819 --> 30:05.956
<i>because of the law,
he cannot accept</i>

30:06.023 --> 30:07.256
anyone else on the boat

30:07.323 --> 30:08.892
unless it's unanimously
agreed upon.

30:08.959 --> 30:10.726
<i>The catch is that we're
gonna give him the reason</i>

30:10.793 --> 30:12.328
<i>why this guy
can't get on the boat.</i>

30:13.362 --> 30:14.664
You see that?

30:14.730 --> 30:17.366
Guy over there
flagging us down.

30:17.433 --> 30:19.435
- A guy?
- <i>Uh-oh, Q. Uh-oh, Q.</i>

30:19.502 --> 30:20.670
Somebody's in the water.

30:23.639 --> 30:25.042
<i>You see who that is, Q?</i>

30:25.108 --> 30:28.611
<i>Is that a U.S. soldier?</i>

30:28.678 --> 30:30.680
- <i>A hero?</i>
- <i>An American hero.</i>

30:30.746 --> 30:33.150
It's G.I. Float.

30:33.215 --> 30:35.718
I'm a U.S. soldier in distress.

30:35.785 --> 30:36.887
Can you please help?

30:36.953 --> 30:38.088
We have to make sure
that everyone's okay

30:38.155 --> 30:39.321
with bringing him on.

30:39.388 --> 30:40.322
Are you guys
all right with that?

30:40.389 --> 30:41.724
Yeah, that's all right.

30:41.791 --> 30:43.325
You're okay
with bringing him on?

30:43.392 --> 30:46.963
If he's in distress,
then we want to help.

30:47.030 --> 30:48.364
You okay to bring him on?

30:48.431 --> 30:49.799
Well, hear me out.

30:49.866 --> 30:51.434
I mean, we help a solider
in a dinghy,

30:51.500 --> 30:53.335
what's that gonna do
for his confidence?

30:53.402 --> 30:55.571
If we...

30:55.638 --> 30:57.606
If we were to help
a soldier in a dinghy,

30:57.673 --> 30:59.575
what's that do
for his confidence?

31:01.577 --> 31:04.147
We have backed him
into a corner like no other.

31:04.213 --> 31:06.315
- Where's he from?
- Where did you serve?

31:06.382 --> 31:09.052
- Iraq.
- Oh, so he survived Iraq.

31:09.119 --> 31:10.486
He's okay.

31:10.553 --> 31:13.090
I thank you for your service.

31:13.156 --> 31:15.825
I'm just saying, we don't really
know anything about the guy.

31:15.892 --> 31:17.928
They sell that outfit
at any Army-Navy store.

31:17.994 --> 31:20.463
You know?

31:20.529 --> 31:21.898
How is this even an issue?

31:26.368 --> 31:27.703
I know this looks like
I don't want

31:27.770 --> 31:29.206
to save a U.S. soldier
in distress...

31:29.305 --> 31:31.007
- No, it doesn't.
- It doesn't? Great.

31:32.241 --> 31:33.977
- Oh! Oh, my God!
- Wow.

31:34.044 --> 31:36.512
How is he convincing people
not to help a soldier?

31:36.579 --> 31:38.915
I know, right, a unanimous
vote from you guys, seriously.

31:38.982 --> 31:40.150
Yeah, we're good.

31:40.217 --> 31:41.417
We talked it out,

31:41.484 --> 31:43.519
and we're okay
just bailing on him.

31:43.586 --> 31:45.088
I feel bad
leaving him out there.

31:45.155 --> 31:46.555
- Yes!
- Oh.

31:46.622 --> 31:48.959
I need an answer
from each of you, then, so...

31:49.025 --> 31:51.128
I'll go with whatever
the group decides.

31:51.194 --> 31:52.328
Let him on the boat.

31:52.394 --> 31:53.562
- Yeah?
- <i>Oh!</i>

31:53.629 --> 31:56.432
- Let him on?
- Yeah!

31:56.499 --> 31:57.833
Where were you going to?

31:57.901 --> 32:00.269
Uh, actually,
I was trying to get to Miami

32:00.336 --> 32:02.072
to see the Paula Abdul concert.

32:03.672 --> 32:06.009
Aren't we all.

32:11.915 --> 32:13.582
<i>This looks like
a real party crowd</i>

32:13.649 --> 32:15.919
you have out there, pal.

32:15.986 --> 32:17.820
We're about to roll up
on somebody.

32:17.888 --> 32:20.456
<i>Here we go,
they're already worried.</i>

32:20.523 --> 32:22.259
It's a man in a boat?

32:22.324 --> 32:24.060
<i>Joe, why don't you go take
a look at who's in distress?</i>

32:24.127 --> 32:26.328
Just watch Joe's face.

32:28.430 --> 32:29.698
I'm stuck.

32:29.765 --> 32:31.500
Can you swing around,
give me a hand?

32:31.567 --> 32:32.701
Oh, man.

32:34.938 --> 32:37.339
Oh, I'm stuck!

32:37.406 --> 32:40.110
I'm having trouble
getting back on the boat.

32:40.177 --> 32:42.946
What does he think?

32:43.013 --> 32:45.548
Basically, maritime law says
that if we bring him on,

32:45.614 --> 32:47.550
everyone has to be okay
with us bringing him on.

32:47.616 --> 32:49.986
- Does it have to be unanimous?
- It has to be unanimous.

32:50.053 --> 32:51.420
- Is it all right with you?
- Oh, no it...

32:51.487 --> 32:52.521
- Is it okay with you, sir?
- Yeah.

32:53.190 --> 32:54.824
Oh, no.

32:56.193 --> 32:57.359
I mean, hear me out.

32:57.426 --> 32:58.727
I promised I'd never put myself

32:58.794 --> 33:00.329
into this situation again.

33:00.396 --> 33:01.630
I promised
I'd never put myself

33:01.697 --> 33:02.966
in this situation again.

33:03.033 --> 33:04.234
I've been burned once.

33:04.301 --> 33:05.135
I'm not gonna let it
happen twice.

33:06.970 --> 33:08.537
- You're saying no?
- I'm saying no, yeah.

33:08.604 --> 33:10.639
Murr, I'm having issues
with my dinghy.

33:10.706 --> 33:13.475
Guys, I'm having issues
with my dinghy.

33:13.542 --> 33:15.411
I don't know which dinghy
he's talking about.

33:15.477 --> 33:17.479
I don't know.

33:19.115 --> 33:21.885
I mean, you gotta see it
from our point of view, pal.

33:21.952 --> 33:23.752
Joe, go on a rant.
Take this thing over.

33:23.819 --> 33:25.521
You got your buttocks out
in the middle of the ocean,

33:25.588 --> 33:27.389
bobbing up and down
with a lady on the boat,

33:27.456 --> 33:28.859
I mean, you want us
to take you on...

33:28.925 --> 33:30.526
- I mean, where are your trunks?
- What?

33:30.593 --> 33:32.863
The logic doesn't track.
Where are your trunks?

33:34.830 --> 33:36.867
Can't we just help him
get on his boat?

33:36.933 --> 33:38.467
<i>Joey,
it's you versus Murr.</i>

33:38.534 --> 33:41.004
- He gets on, you lose.
- Dead, pal.

33:41.071 --> 33:44.406
Yeah, the rule is we both
get on this boat, I lose.

33:45.242 --> 33:47.843
- Pretty much.
- What?

33:47.911 --> 33:49.279
Wait, wait, whoa, whoa.
Hold on!

33:49.346 --> 33:50.679
What are you doing?

33:51.513 --> 33:53.149
<i>Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joey.</i>

33:53.216 --> 33:54.783
What are you... What?

33:54.851 --> 33:57.386
I'm out. Ah!

34:00.991 --> 34:02.325
Is this for real?

34:02.391 --> 34:04.627
<i>He's gonna save him.
He's going to save him.</i>

34:04.693 --> 34:07.696
- Come on!
- So Murray still loses.

34:07.763 --> 34:09.199
- That's it, he's off.
- Oh, my God, Murray...

34:09.266 --> 34:10.399
<i>Well, he's not
getting on the boat.</i>

34:10.466 --> 34:11.500
- Get in...
- Just not...

34:11.567 --> 34:13.769
- Oh!
- Oh!

34:13.836 --> 34:15.604
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

34:15.671 --> 34:18.008
How could you dare
touch that ass?

34:18.074 --> 34:20.877
- I'll see you back at land.
- Are you kidding me? Joe!

34:20.944 --> 34:22.444
Do you have beer on this boat?

34:24.080 --> 34:25.282
Son of a...

34:46.669 --> 34:49.906
- Wow. This is special.
- Ooh.

34:49.973 --> 34:51.473
You couldn't have booked
something a little bit better?

34:51.540 --> 34:53.109
It's 2 1/2 stars.
How many stars do you need?

34:53.176 --> 34:54.743
- All of them.
- One of the reviews,

34:54.810 --> 34:57.780
Danny D. says,
"Found two crack pipes, lolz."

34:57.846 --> 35:00.317
With a Z.
Still gave it four stars.

35:00.383 --> 35:01.483
- All right.
- With a Z?

35:01.550 --> 35:02.953
- It's got cable.
- That's hip.

35:13.029 --> 35:14.463
You guys did not think
we weren't gonna

35:14.530 --> 35:16.032
mess with Sal
on this trip, did you?

35:16.099 --> 35:18.001
Yeah, that's right, we stopped
at this roadside motel

35:18.068 --> 35:19.501
because they allow pets.

35:19.568 --> 35:21.004
You're about to see
a grown man cry.

35:23.106 --> 35:24.773
I was saying, like, pull up
to him, so it could be fun.

35:24.840 --> 35:26.508
Just... You're just going
to see what he's doing.

35:26.575 --> 35:28.677
- Right. Hoodie's on?
- Get in.

35:31.847 --> 35:32.949
What?

35:36.485 --> 35:38.254
All right. Can I...

35:38.321 --> 35:39.722
Just open the door, buddy.

35:39.788 --> 35:41.858
- There's no handle.
- No handle?

35:41.925 --> 35:43.559
This isn't the nicest motel.

35:43.625 --> 35:45.128
This wasn't right for today.

35:45.195 --> 35:47.230
Sal, everybody knows
you're afraid of cats.

35:55.571 --> 35:58.341
Oh, my...

35:58.408 --> 36:00.276
That's a tiger.

36:00.343 --> 36:02.678
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

36:02.745 --> 36:05.848
I can't do this. Oh, my God.

36:05.915 --> 36:08.985
How did you get the insurance
to sign off on this?

36:09.052 --> 36:10.387
We didn't.

36:10.453 --> 36:12.788
Guys, I don't think it's funny.
I don't want to do it.

36:12.856 --> 36:15.824
Guys, please. Guys, please.
Guys, please.

36:15.892 --> 36:17.293
I don't think it's funny, guys.

36:19.062 --> 36:20.263
Oh. Can't move.

36:20.330 --> 36:22.598
Yeah, that's probably wise
that you don't move.

36:22.664 --> 36:25.035
I've seen so many movies
and so many TV shows...

36:25.101 --> 36:27.569
In one second,
if this tiger wants to kill me,

36:27.636 --> 36:29.571
the tiger's gonna kill me.

36:31.307 --> 36:33.675
Guys, did you think this
through all the way?

36:33.742 --> 36:35.111
- Not really
- Not really, no.

36:35.178 --> 36:37.013
How can you do this to me?
What do I do?

36:37.080 --> 36:38.515
Try to get
out of the room, bud.

36:38.580 --> 36:40.150
There's a door
right in front of you.

36:43.520 --> 36:45.055
- Uh-oh.
- <i>Uh-oh.</i>

36:45.121 --> 36:46.856
Now he's more concerned
about the lock than the tiger.

36:46.923 --> 36:49.959
No, no, no, no, no.

36:50.026 --> 36:51.294
<i>Oh, my God. Oh, my God.</i>

36:51.361 --> 36:52.395
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

36:52.462 --> 36:56.366
Guys, I can't make it.

36:56.433 --> 36:58.034
<i>Good, he's brushing
his teeth. Go, go.</i>

36:58.101 --> 36:59.802
- <i>He's brushing his teeth.</i>
- <i>There he goes.</i>

36:59.869 --> 37:00.836
- <i>He's up on the sink.</i>
- <i>Get out of there.</i>

37:00.904 --> 37:03.239
<i>Get out of there, quick.</i>

37:03.306 --> 37:05.275
Look at the poster
in front of your face.

37:05.341 --> 37:08.211
- You think that's funny?
- <i>It's the shit.</i>

37:08.278 --> 37:10.046
Just hang in there, pal.

37:10.113 --> 37:11.814
Guys, I...

37:12.714 --> 37:15.251
don't think this is funny.

37:15.318 --> 37:17.619
- Who's there?
- Just let me in, guys.

37:17.686 --> 37:18.955
- It's not funny.
- <i>Sal, it's super easy.</i>

37:19.022 --> 37:20.090
<i>You just have to say
this sentence.</i>

37:20.156 --> 37:21.491
- <i>Go ahead.</i>
- "Let me in.

37:21.558 --> 37:23.725
I'm a baby bitch boy."

37:23.792 --> 37:25.328
Let me in,
I'm the baby bitch boy.

37:26.829 --> 37:28.364
No, no, that's what Joe
wanted you to say.

37:28.431 --> 37:29.832
I want you to say,

37:29.899 --> 37:33.236
"Murr's funnier, smarter,
and better than me."

37:33.303 --> 37:35.038
Come here, buddy.
Come here, buddy.

37:51.121 --> 37:53.356
Chaplin moustache
will never come back.

37:53.423 --> 37:54.457
- Oh, hey, bud.
- Hey.

37:54.524 --> 37:55.358
Do you know the Wi-Fi password?

37:55.425 --> 37:56.692
Oh, the Wi-Fi?

37:56.758 --> 37:57.961
Sure, you don't have it
in your room?

37:58.027 --> 37:59.896
No, the card's not in there,
so, yeah.

38:05.335 --> 38:07.003
I mean, just search
for Morgan Suites.

38:07.070 --> 38:08.571
The password is "password."

38:08.637 --> 38:10.306
The password is "password"?
That's not very secure.

38:10.373 --> 38:12.041
- No.
- Yeah. Oh, hey.

38:12.108 --> 38:14.710
Oh, hey! It's the Houlihans.

38:14.776 --> 38:16.845
One sec. Hey, Marisa, Chris.
Come on.

38:16.913 --> 38:17.947
- Please, please.
- Murr!

38:18.014 --> 38:19.681
Hey, Marisa, you look gorgeous.

38:19.748 --> 38:20.716
- Yeah.
- And Chris.

38:20.782 --> 38:21.851
Scotch is in the back.

38:21.918 --> 38:23.253
- Take it easy this time.
- Always.

38:23.319 --> 38:24.387
- All right, buddy. Good night.
- All right, man.

38:24.454 --> 38:25.388
You have a good night.

38:35.532 --> 38:36.966
Grover Cleveland
was a Capricorn... Yeah, man?

38:37.033 --> 38:38.268
Are there any caps
on the password?

38:38.334 --> 38:39.302
All caps.

38:39.369 --> 38:40.802
All caps password.
Yeah, thanks.

39:01.524 --> 39:04.760
Uh-huh. I guess I'm late.

39:04.826 --> 39:07.163
What do you want to do?

39:07.230 --> 39:08.830
All right, this looks nice
and cool in the sun.

39:08.898 --> 39:09.866
This is gonna be great.

39:13.469 --> 39:15.405
All right.

39:15.471 --> 39:16.873
Here we go.

39:16.940 --> 39:18.608
Oh, God, I'm gonna die.

39:20.076 --> 39:22.245
Nobody told me your name,
buddy.

39:22.312 --> 39:24.547
So how about we go
with Benjamin Horse?

39:24.614 --> 39:26.316
Yes. All right.

39:30.620 --> 39:32.322
Oh.

39:32.388 --> 39:33.789
Oh, my goodness.

39:35.325 --> 39:39.162
This says we go up one mile
and make a left,

39:39.229 --> 39:42.932
and then we can punch the guys.

39:42.999 --> 39:44.867
I'd like to marry a girl
like you one day.

39:44.934 --> 39:47.736
Pretty. Beautiful blue eyes.

39:47.803 --> 39:50.006
Calm, steady demeanor.

39:50.073 --> 39:53.742
You guys messed up,
because I'm havin' a blast!

39:53.809 --> 39:56.212
This is the best
road trip ever!

40:02.952 --> 40:04.320
Let me ask you this,

40:04.387 --> 40:06.556
When was the last time
you had an E.L. Fudge?

40:06.623 --> 40:08.258
- One week ago.
- Really?

40:08.324 --> 40:09.626
- No exaggeration.
- You're lying.

40:09.692 --> 40:11.394
I swear to God.

40:11.461 --> 40:13.563
Fudge Stripe gets all the shine
over at Keebler.

40:13.630 --> 40:14.998
Fudge Stripe's a better cookie.

40:15.064 --> 40:16.832
I'm talking Keebler,
I'm talking E.L. Fudge.

40:16.899 --> 40:18.668
I'm talking Fudge Stripe,
and then I move on.

40:18.735 --> 40:20.103
I'll give you $1,000/

40:20.169 --> 40:21.871
if any of you can tell me
what E.L. stands for.

40:23.306 --> 40:24.840
I'm blowing your mind
right now.

40:24.907 --> 40:28.278
Everybody loves?

40:28.344 --> 40:31.748
- Shit.
- You carry $1,000 with you?

40:31.813 --> 40:34.384
- I think I see someone.
- Yeah!

40:34.450 --> 40:35.518
Oh, there he is.

40:36.486 --> 40:38.655
Welcome to the party, pal.

40:38.721 --> 40:40.056
Come on, Fatiator.

40:40.123 --> 40:42.325
Once my balls shot directly
up in my body

40:42.392 --> 40:45.827
about a mile back,
I started enjoying it.

40:45.895 --> 40:47.263
- You got it. Be careful, man.
- Whoa!

40:47.330 --> 40:50.733
- Park it over there.
- Okay, okay. All right.

40:50.799 --> 40:51.868
You good?

40:57.073 --> 40:58.541
You're forever
my horse, baby.

41:09.686 --> 41:11.721
Murr, how... This idiot.

41:11.788 --> 41:13.256
- What?
- Look at...

41:15.224 --> 41:17.260
How does he even sleep
like that?

41:17.327 --> 41:18.861
Oh, man.
He's got no idea what's coming.

41:18.928 --> 41:21.097

We're here to celebrate him.

42:06.876 --> 42:08.578

42:13.516 --> 42:14.817
I hold back.

42:14.884 --> 42:17.086
I get shy at first.

42:18.955 --> 42:21.124

42:51.454 --> 42:54.157
That's James' nieces

42:54.223 --> 42:56.292

put an ad out for that.

43:45.975 --> 43:47.443
It's unclear.

44:10.399 --> 44:11.501
- Well, welcome.
- Thank you.

44:11.567 --> 44:12.735
So where are you
coming in from?

44:12.802 --> 44:14.170
Oh, I live here in Atlanta.

44:14.237 --> 44:15.838
You answer the questions
we ask you.

44:15.906 --> 44:17.440
So where are you
from originally?

44:17.507 --> 44:19.408
<i>Where do I see myself
in five years?</i>

44:19.475 --> 44:22.378
Well, in five years,
I see myself well on track

44:22.445 --> 44:24.480
to maybe a managerial...

44:24.547 --> 44:25.715
Okay, great.

44:25.781 --> 44:27.817
So how'd you hear
about this role in particular?

44:27.885 --> 44:29.519
Oh.

44:29.585 --> 44:30.753
<i>Well, what do you feel
your biggest strength is?</i>

44:30.820 --> 44:32.021
My biggest strengths are...

44:33.422 --> 44:35.859
I would say confidence,
approachability...

44:35.926 --> 44:37.527
- Sure.
- I'm easy to talk with.

44:37.593 --> 44:39.362
Why leave your position
at Georgia State?

44:39.428 --> 44:40.931
I saw you were there
until March.

44:40.998 --> 44:42.966
- <i>In full disclosure...</i>
- In full disclosure...

44:43.032 --> 44:48.005
- I had a child out of wedlock.
- I had a child out of wedlock.

44:48.070 --> 44:50.306
If that disqualifies me
from the job, I understand.

44:50.373 --> 44:53.075
If that disqualifies me
from the job, I understand.

44:53.142 --> 44:55.811
- Nope. Nope. Certainly not.
- Right.

44:57.413 --> 44:59.515
I put a Polaroid camera.
Just take a quick picture.

45:00.216 --> 45:01.250
- Cool.
- Right?

45:01.317 --> 45:02.785
- You got a...
- Yeah.

45:04.453 --> 45:06.622
- Camera. Nice.

<i>Get him to sign it.
Get him to sign it.</i>

45:08.324 --> 45:10.459
- Well, um...
- Can you autograph?

45:10.526 --> 45:12.194
- Is that cool?
- Sure, yeah. Yeah, bring it.

45:12.261 --> 45:13.529
<i>I mean,
you are on the Hawks.</i>

45:13.596 --> 45:15.032
I mean,
you are on the Hawks, so...

45:15.097 --> 45:16.666
Yeah, well... Yeah.

45:16.732 --> 45:18.568
I have to apologize
if I seem a little off.

45:18.634 --> 45:20.202
I have to apologize,
by the way,

45:20.269 --> 45:21.905
if I seem a little off
during the interview.

45:21.972 --> 45:23.105
Aunt Flo's in town.

45:23.172 --> 45:25.408
Aunt...

45:25.474 --> 45:27.310
Frick.

45:27.376 --> 45:28.711
Looks like I'm not
getting the job.

45:31.247 --> 45:32.950
- <i>Or the party ticket.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

45:36.218 --> 45:37.620
<i>Look at this, boys.</i>

45:37.687 --> 45:38.989
<i>This is big-time...

45:39.056 --> 45:40.389
you're gonna be
big-time, buddy.

45:40.456 --> 45:41.524
This is a big-time gig
we're infiltrating.

45:41.591 --> 45:43.659
I'm ready for the big time.

45:43.726 --> 45:45.595
- <i>Here she comes.</i>
- Hello, hi.

45:45.661 --> 45:47.430
- How are you?
- How are you? I'm Brian.

45:47.496 --> 45:50.199
- Hey. Nice to meet you.
- Very nice to meet you.

45:50.266 --> 45:51.233
<i>Here we go.</i>

45:51.300 --> 45:52.735
- Oh.
- Here we go, Q.

45:52.802 --> 45:54.804
You've seen
the job description.

45:54.871 --> 45:56.339
- I have. Yeah.
- Correct?

45:56.405 --> 45:58.641
- I got it right here.
- Two words, under qualified.

45:58.708 --> 46:01.477
Two words, under qualified,
but willing to learn.

46:01.544 --> 46:03.512
Willing to learn. That's great.

46:04.814 --> 46:07.450
Can you describe
your style of management?

46:07.516 --> 46:09.086
- My style of management?
- Mmm-hmm.

46:09.151 --> 46:10.453
Sure, well,
my nickname's Crab Cake,

46:10.519 --> 46:11.955
so if that's any indication...

46:12.022 --> 46:14.357
My nickname... All my, uh...

46:14.423 --> 46:16.258
All my workers
call me Crab Cakes,

46:16.325 --> 46:17.760
if that's any indication.

46:17.827 --> 46:18.962
- Yeah.
- Really?

46:19.029 --> 46:20.030
- Yeah, Crab Cakes.
- Yeah.

46:21.497 --> 46:23.199
If the guys want
to call me Crab Cakes,

46:23.265 --> 46:26.069
hey, call me Crab Cakes.

46:26.135 --> 46:27.570
- <i>Off topic...</i>
- Off topic...

46:27.637 --> 46:29.906
Is that stupid mascot
of yours a woodpecker?

46:29.973 --> 46:31.273
What is that thing?

46:31.340 --> 46:34.243
Is that...
That stupid mascot you have,

46:34.310 --> 46:35.946
is that a woodpecker,
what is that thing?

46:37.713 --> 46:39.281
- I can't even look.
- Oh, my God.

46:39.348 --> 46:41.450
- I can't even look.
- <i>It's a hawk.</i>

46:41.517 --> 46:42.752
I don't know
what you call that bird.

46:42.818 --> 46:44.353
Yeah? Oh, it looks
like a woodpecker.

46:48.724 --> 46:49.792
Yeah.

46:49.860 --> 46:51.494
Tell me a little bit
about yourself.

46:51.560 --> 46:53.796
Will I be pissing in a cup
for a drug test?

46:54.563 --> 46:56.599
Do you know, is, um...

47:01.872 --> 47:03.272
He doesn't want to say it.

47:03.339 --> 47:05.207
Yeah, I really tanked this one.

47:05.274 --> 47:07.176
There's no way
I'm going to see Abdul.

47:07.243 --> 47:10.013
There's no way I'm going
to see Paula Abdul.

47:12.548 --> 47:13.950
Explain the plot of the movie.

47:14.017 --> 47:15.418
We're four high school friends.

47:15.484 --> 47:17.954
So we're on a road trip
for redemption

47:18.021 --> 47:20.489
for an incident that happened
back in 1990,

47:20.556 --> 47:22.025
like, coming back
to haunt us now.

47:22.092 --> 47:24.161
And there's only three tickets
to see Abdul,

47:24.226 --> 47:26.629
and one of us can't go.

47:26.696 --> 47:28.831
- Rate our movie.
- The movie's 3 1/2 stars.

47:28.899 --> 47:30.633
The movie's gonna be
3 1/2 stars.

47:32.035 --> 47:33.469
This interview is bullshit.

47:36.372 --> 47:38.207
This interview is bullshit.

47:41.078 --> 47:43.446
Thank you.

47:43.512 --> 47:45.214
It's total bullshit.

47:46.449 --> 47:49.218
It's all for a movie.

47:51.021 --> 47:52.989
<i>Hey, buddy,
everything look cozy?</i>

47:53.056 --> 47:54.858
Yep.
What's that?

47:54.925 --> 47:56.692
<i>That's Chase, you met him
at a Big Brother program.</i>

47:56.759 --> 47:58.561
Then you lost him, and now
he's your guardian angel

47:58.627 --> 48:00.964
that looks over you
during all the big events,

48:01.031 --> 48:02.231
including job interviews.

48:02.298 --> 48:03.632
- Hey.
- Oh, hey, yeah, yeah.

48:03.699 --> 48:05.835
How are you?
Very random.

48:05.902 --> 48:08.838
- That's actually Chase.
- Okay. Great.

48:08.905 --> 48:10.040
He was my Little Brother,

48:10.107 --> 48:11.141
in the Little Brother,
Big Brother program.

48:11.208 --> 48:12.508
Okay.

48:12.575 --> 48:13.910
He's like my guardian angel,
inspiration.

48:13.977 --> 48:15.444
He's gonna look over
the interview for me.

48:15.511 --> 48:16.812
- Oh, I think that's great.
- Thank you.

48:16.880 --> 48:18.447
I was like, did someone
leave anything?

48:18.514 --> 48:19.515
- Oh, no, what is your name?
- Brandy. Brandy.

48:19.582 --> 48:20.616
- Brandy.
- Yeah, sorry.

48:20.683 --> 48:22.085
- Nice to meet you.
- I'm Sal.

48:22.152 --> 48:23.186
Immediately launch into
why the Earth is flat.

48:24.420 --> 48:25.521
I like talking to people

48:25.588 --> 48:26.857
about all different types
of things.

48:26.923 --> 48:28.257
- Right.
- You know, for example, like,

48:28.324 --> 48:30.326
no denying it for me that the,

48:30.392 --> 48:32.095
you know, I believe
the Earth is flat.

48:32.162 --> 48:33.997
So I like to talk about that.

48:34.064 --> 48:35.264
Okay. Great.

48:36.967 --> 48:38.567
How do you feel
about the shape of the Earth?

48:38.634 --> 48:41.637
What is your opinion
on the shape of the Earth?

48:41.704 --> 48:43.305
- Um...
- <i>There's the look.</i>

48:43.372 --> 48:47.210
I mean, I'm pretty literal,
so I'm gonna go with round.

48:47.276 --> 48:48.677
Yeah, most people
think it's round.

48:48.744 --> 48:50.646
- Yeah.
- But they'd be wrong.

48:52.782 --> 48:54.383
They told me to bring
a recommendation,

48:54.450 --> 48:55.952
- so I brought one.
- They said to bring a rec...

48:56.019 --> 48:59.222
A recommendation too, and
I also have a recommendation.

48:59.288 --> 49:00.790
Sal, pull out the iPad there.

49:00.857 --> 49:02.324
Uh, so here.

49:05.327 --> 49:06.863
<i>It's Sal's mom, Adele.</i>

49:08.464 --> 49:11.700
Please hire him.
He'd be a good employee.

49:11.767 --> 49:14.303
He doesn't steal.
He's a good boy.

49:14.370 --> 49:16.639
<i>He pays me to clean his house,</i>

49:16.705 --> 49:18.307
<i>so please, please,
please hire him</i>

49:18.374 --> 49:20.110
<i>so he can keep paying me.</i>

49:21.777 --> 49:24.047
<i>Oh, my God.
That's awesome.</i>

49:25.215 --> 49:27.117
- You good?
- Ah, hell, nah!

49:27.184 --> 49:30.153
Instead of "Oh, hell, no,"
do the singing version of it.

49:30.220 --> 49:31.353
<i>♪ Hell, no ♪</i>

49:31.420 --> 49:33.722
<i>♪ To the no, no, no ♪</i>

49:35.391 --> 49:38.394
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

49:38.460 --> 49:40.362
- What are you writing?
- What, what are you...

49:40.429 --> 49:41.564
What are you writing?

49:43.432 --> 49:45.035
- My notes.
- Oh, great. Perfect.

49:47.503 --> 49:48.771
Take notes.

49:48.838 --> 49:50.773
<i>Yeah, Sal,
take notes on her.</i>

49:56.512 --> 49:59.415
Sal, just go, "Are there
one T or two in 'pretty'?"

50:02.118 --> 50:03.752
Ah, done!

50:03.819 --> 50:06.990
- Done, boys.
- Well done.

50:08.424 --> 50:10.927
Okay, so this is my outfit.

50:10.994 --> 50:14.197
<i>Yeah, Joey in a breakaway
basketball warmup suit.</i>

50:14.264 --> 50:15.497
So as soon as the person
comes in,

50:15.564 --> 50:17.566
you just get ready
for game time.

50:19.735 --> 50:21.238
- Hey, how are you?
- Good. How are you?

50:21.304 --> 50:22.705
- <i>Big hug.</i>
- Nice to see you.

50:22.771 --> 50:24.573
- Emily. Nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you.

50:24.640 --> 50:26.742
- Yeah, I'm ready to do this.
- Oh, here you go.

50:26.809 --> 50:28.945
- That's amazing.
- Right?

50:29.012 --> 50:30.046
That is awesome.

50:31.882 --> 50:33.382
So nice to meet you.
I'm Emily.

50:33.449 --> 50:34.817
I'm the building
security manager.

50:34.885 --> 50:36.319
- Building security manager?
- Yes, sir, so...

50:36.385 --> 50:37.320
And what was your name again?
I'm sorry.

50:37.386 --> 50:39.022
Emily. Yes, sir.

50:39.089 --> 50:41.091
I'm gonna let you get started
other than that amazing intro.

50:41.157 --> 50:42.758
- Oh, thank you.
- Joe, where are you from?

50:42.825 --> 50:44.127
Tell me a little bit
about yourself.

50:44.194 --> 50:45.362
Nah, nah.

50:45.427 --> 50:47.429
Nah, I didn't want to...

50:47.496 --> 50:48.797
I didn't really want
to get into that.

50:50.566 --> 50:52.369
What's that?
Which part.

50:52.434 --> 50:54.570
My past.
My shadowy past.

50:54.637 --> 50:56.940
My shadowy past.
I didn't really want to start...

50:58.707 --> 51:00.277
Keep saying "off the record."

51:00.343 --> 51:01.677
- Off the record...
- Mmm-hmm.

51:01.744 --> 51:03.914
I negotiated prices
for, like, bulk supplies.

51:03.980 --> 51:05.547
- Mmm-hmm.
- I would let them in

51:05.614 --> 51:07.083
on the, to the side.

51:07.150 --> 51:08.952
Joe, she's writing this down.
It's off the record.

51:09.019 --> 51:10.719
Yeah,
but this is all off the...

51:10.786 --> 51:12.389
- This is all off the record.
- No, no, you're fine.

51:12.454 --> 51:13.522
I'm just talking about your
extension of knowledge with...

51:13.589 --> 51:14.958
Got it, got it.

51:15.025 --> 51:16.393
Um, what else can I tell you
off the record?

51:16.458 --> 51:18.194
Joe, have a roving finger.

51:18.261 --> 51:20.096
There was one time
when a whole crew was in here,

51:20.163 --> 51:21.898
and they had to actually be on
the other side of the campus,

51:21.965 --> 51:23.867
but the middle was closed,
so I couldn't get them through.

51:23.934 --> 51:25.434
We had to actually
go around the whole thing.

51:25.501 --> 51:26.669
- But off the record.
- Off the record, Monica.

51:26.735 --> 51:27.569
Off the record,
we went through

51:27.636 --> 51:28.872
the closed road, Monica.

51:28.939 --> 51:30.506
<i>Here comes
the moving finger.</i>

51:30.572 --> 51:31.740
And, you know, there was
a lot of teams up here,

51:31.807 --> 51:32.876
and then
we brought it down south.

51:32.943 --> 51:34.610
You know,
you connect everybody,

51:34.677 --> 51:36.612
and they all have their
own conferences and stuff,

51:36.679 --> 51:38.281
but, uh, I have stopped...

51:38.348 --> 51:40.649
Excuse yourself for one quick
moment to go to the bathroom

51:40.716 --> 51:42.518
and then go downstairs
and play basketball.

51:42.584 --> 51:44.820
Um, I need to use
the restroom real quick.

51:44.888 --> 51:46.256
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, sure, no worries.

51:46.323 --> 51:47.991
- I'll be right back.
- Yeah.

51:48.992 --> 51:50.093
I'll be right back.
I'm sorry.

51:50.160 --> 51:51.760
- Yeah, okay.
- Thanks.

51:53.229 --> 51:55.899
<i>Look at her face!</i>

52:01.503 --> 52:03.639
- <i>This is gonna be amazing.</i>
- <i>Her face is...</i>

52:15.651 --> 52:16.886
Almost.

52:16.953 --> 52:19.189
Joey, uh, security
really sucks around here.

52:20.924 --> 52:22.959
- You good?
- Yeah, security really sucks.

52:23.026 --> 52:25.061
I was able just to go down
there and shoot hoops.

52:31.633 --> 52:33.602
- Yeah.
- So security's an issue.

52:34.137 --> 52:35.038
Yeah.

52:35.105 --> 52:37.273
Security's an issue.

52:37.340 --> 52:40.210
All right, well, do you have
any further questions for me?

52:40.276 --> 52:42.778
Tell her you'll be in touch
and she did great.

52:42.845 --> 52:44.014
And, uh, that's it.
Yeah, thank you so much.

52:44.080 --> 52:46.749
You did great.
We'll be in touch.

52:46.815 --> 52:48.151
I'll get Jakim to, uh...

52:48.218 --> 52:50.586
Hey, appreciate it.
Yeah, we'll let you know.

52:51.955 --> 52:53.423
Possibly.
Maybe we'll hire her.

52:55.291 --> 52:56.426
Maybe we'll hire her.

52:56.493 --> 52:57.360
I'm not sure
if we'll hire her.

53:03.599 --> 53:05.101
- <i>A left right here?</i>
- <i>Go.</i>

53:05.168 --> 53:07.103
<i>Yeah, baby, yeah!</i>

53:07.170 --> 53:09.571
<i>Disgusting loading dock.
Nice, guys.</i>

53:13.910 --> 53:15.879
Now do you want to tell me
why we're here?

53:15.945 --> 53:17.247
We're just gonna pop into

53:17.313 --> 53:18.714
this social media convention
real quick.

53:18.781 --> 53:20.849
- Uh-huh.
- Here's your credentials.

53:20.917 --> 53:22.452
We're having fun with you today
at your expense.

53:22.519 --> 53:24.921
Hey, bud, uh, you're, uh...
You're on in ten minutes.

53:26.222 --> 53:28.324
You're terrible
at social networking, so...

53:32.228 --> 53:33.329
Give it up one more time

53:33.396 --> 53:35.065
for your When Brands
Take a Stand panel.

53:37.467 --> 53:39.302
<i>So we are at
the Social Shake-Up,</i>

53:39.369 --> 53:42.738
<i>which is a tremendous
social media conference here,</i>

53:42.805 --> 53:45.075
and Q is about to go up
and give a presentation.

53:45.141 --> 53:46.708
- Yeah.
- We wrote the presentation.

53:46.775 --> 53:48.644
He's never seen a single
one of these slides.

53:48.710 --> 53:50.080
<i>There's 600 people here,</i>

53:50.146 --> 53:52.048
which is a little more
than we usually have.

53:52.115 --> 53:53.283
A little more?

53:53.349 --> 53:57.087
We do have a last-minute
addition to the roster.

53:57.153 --> 53:59.856
<i>We have a new speaker
coming up.</i>

53:59.923 --> 54:01.757
We have been trying
to do this for years.

54:01.824 --> 54:04.994
Please welcome to the stage
Peter Foaks.

54:06.529 --> 54:07.629
Peter Foaks.

54:12.402 --> 54:13.802
Good morning, everybody.

54:13.870 --> 54:15.704
Very excited to be here.
Thank you for having me.

54:15.771 --> 54:16.973
My name is Peter Foaks.

54:17.040 --> 54:18.541
They brought me here
'cause I'm...

54:18.640 --> 54:20.977
really been doing well
as a social media influencer,

54:21.044 --> 54:23.745
so why don't we get started.

54:23.812 --> 54:26.682
How to Become
a Social Media Influencer,

54:26.748 --> 54:29.718
or as my dad calls it,
"not have a real job."

54:31.620 --> 54:33.957
So here we go.

54:34.023 --> 54:36.192
His world after this
is gonna change.

54:36.259 --> 54:38.461
We may not be friends
after this moment.

54:38.528 --> 54:40.063
I recently interviewed

54:40.130 --> 54:41.965
social media influencer
Franz Goldberg.

54:42.031 --> 54:44.100
Do you guys know who that is?

54:44.167 --> 54:45.969
Ah, you're gonna love this.
Okay.

54:46.035 --> 54:47.703
<i>Hi, my name
is Franz Goldberg,</i>

54:47.769 --> 54:50.039
<i>and I'm what you would call
a social media influencer.</i>

54:50.106 --> 54:52.208
<i>My major platform is YouTube.</i>

54:52.275 --> 54:54.010
<i>Advertisers want to...</i>

54:54.077 --> 54:56.312
<i>...and I can provide them...</i>

54:56.379 --> 54:58.448
<i>It's interrupting.</i>

55:01.683 --> 55:03.553
Did somebody call a plumber?

55:03.620 --> 55:06.688
Yes.
I need my pipes cleaned.

55:09.993 --> 55:11.727
That's Q's parents!

55:11.793 --> 55:13.196
That's Q's real parents.

55:13.263 --> 55:16.533
- I can help with that.
- Oh, goody.

55:16.599 --> 55:17.567
Come this way.

55:17.634 --> 55:18.667
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

55:18.734 --> 55:20.436
<i>Good pipes.
Oh.</i>

55:20.503 --> 55:22.438
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

55:22.505 --> 55:24.840
<i>...place them
at the end of my video.</i>

55:24.908 --> 55:27.210
<i>I like to place them inside...</i>

55:33.483 --> 55:36.519
I must have recorded
over an old tape on that one.

55:39.656 --> 55:41.224
Also, um...

55:41.291 --> 55:44.394
you probably shouldn't use
tapes in the modern era,

55:44.460 --> 55:46.596
'cause of accidents like that.

55:46.663 --> 55:48.932
You know, digital...
digital...

55:48.998 --> 55:51.201
I would say digital
is the way to go.

55:51.267 --> 55:53.570
He can't even speak.

55:53.636 --> 55:55.804
His mind is blown.

55:55.872 --> 56:00.210
Okay, well, look,
identify the major brands

56:01.477 --> 56:03.179
that fit with your brands.

56:03.246 --> 56:05.882
You know, stay on brand
is basically what I'm saying.

56:05.949 --> 56:08.084
Uh, oh, no.

56:09.586 --> 56:12.121
Oh, I hope this one doesn't
get interrupted, buddy.

56:12.188 --> 56:14.324
Well, why don't
we give a listen

56:14.390 --> 56:17.427
to what Franz Goldberg
has to say about brands.

56:17.493 --> 56:18.895
Oh.

56:18.962 --> 56:20.263
You think they would have
just brought Franz here,

56:20.330 --> 56:22.899
but no, we got tape.

56:22.966 --> 56:24.601
<i>My audience likes
that I'm real.</i>

56:24.667 --> 56:27.170
- <i>They don't want to be fed...</i>
- It's just gonna go right...

56:27.237 --> 56:29.539
Oh, this is funny.
There... There's Dad.

56:30.739 --> 56:33.176
Well, hello there.

56:33.243 --> 56:35.645
<i>May I help you?</i>

56:35.712 --> 56:37.614
I'm here to plant some seed.

56:39.249 --> 56:41.817
He's a gardener.
You can tell by his hat.

56:41.884 --> 56:44.387
Let me show you
where you can plant it.

56:44.454 --> 56:46.556
<i>Yes, come on.</i>

56:46.623 --> 56:48.358
<i>That bush needs trimming.</i>

56:52.128 --> 56:53.863
My dad had
a lot of side jobs.

56:53.930 --> 56:56.798
- So did your mom.
- So did your mom, apparently.

56:57.766 --> 56:59.469
So did my mom, apparently.

57:02.005 --> 57:03.439
Are there any questions?

57:05.208 --> 57:06.409
No?
No questions.

57:06.476 --> 57:07.910
I-I didn't think so.

57:07.977 --> 57:09.979
All right, well, I have
a few questions myself.

57:12.315 --> 57:13.616
- Thank you.
- <i>Well done, buddy.</i>

57:13.683 --> 57:15.018
<i>Well done.</i>

57:15.084 --> 57:16.986
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Bring it in.

57:17.053 --> 57:19.889
<i>Hey, Brian.
Dad's on his way.</i>

57:19.956 --> 57:22.025
- <i>How did it go?</i>
- How did it go?

57:22.091 --> 57:23.660
- <i>Brian.</i>
- Yeah.

57:23.726 --> 57:26.262
<i>I didn't know who was
gonna be more embarrassed.</i>

57:26.329 --> 57:27.930
- <i>You or us.</i>
- Well, I'll tell you what.

57:27.997 --> 57:29.565
It didn't look like
you guys were embarrassed.

57:29.632 --> 57:31.534
Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Quinn,
I'll be by next week

57:31.601 --> 57:32.635
to film the sequel, okay?

57:32.702 --> 57:34.203
All right, get out of here.

57:34.270 --> 57:36.805
Don't answer the phone
when they call anymore, okay?

57:36.873 --> 57:38.141
All right, love you, Ma.
I love you, Dad.

57:38.207 --> 57:39.509
I'll talk to you guys
in a little bit.

57:46.015 --> 57:48.651
<i>All right, here it is.</i>

57:48.718 --> 57:50.386
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

57:50.453 --> 57:52.355
- There's an event going on.
- What is it?

57:52.422 --> 57:54.524
- Right now, what is it?
- Okay.

57:54.590 --> 57:57.160
- Sally, one of your closest friends is in town tonight.
- Yeah.

57:57.226 --> 57:58.594
Jaden Smith has
a movie premiere.

57:58.661 --> 58:00.396
Stop it.

58:00.463 --> 58:02.332
All right, Sal, so now
you're Jaden's number one fan,

58:02.398 --> 58:03.933
and all you gotta do
is just walk around

58:04.000 --> 58:05.068
and let people know it.

58:05.134 --> 58:07.403
All right, where's our boy?

58:07.470 --> 58:08.638
I feel like an idiot.

58:08.705 --> 58:10.907
<i>Let me see
that tattoo, buddy.</i>

58:10.973 --> 58:12.342
Hi, can I take a picture
of your tattoo?

58:12.408 --> 58:14.210
- Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.
- Nice shorts.

58:14.277 --> 58:16.813
- I'm just his number one fan.
- Honestly, I see it.

58:16.879 --> 58:18.448
I really see it.

58:18.514 --> 58:20.550
<i>Guys, now do you see
what I had envisioned</i>

58:20.616 --> 58:22.085
so many seasons ago?

58:22.151 --> 58:23.319
All right, Sal, you're up.

58:23.386 --> 58:24.620
Three, two, one.

58:30.760 --> 58:31.928
Look!

58:31.994 --> 58:33.763
Jaden Smith, number one fan.

58:33.830 --> 58:35.698
I'm his number one fan.

58:35.765 --> 58:37.633
Act like
his number one fan, buddy!

58:37.700 --> 58:38.935
I'm his number one fan.

58:39.001 --> 58:40.169
You think
you're Jaden's number one fan?

58:40.236 --> 58:41.637
- Yeah, I do.
- You got this shirt?

58:41.704 --> 58:43.106
- I wish I had the shirt.
- You got the tat, though?

58:43.172 --> 58:44.574
- Let's do, oh.
- Come on.

58:46.476 --> 58:48.911
- You know Jaden's blood type?
- There you go.

58:48.978 --> 58:50.813
- Wrong!
- What is it?

58:50.880 --> 58:52.115
- A-negative.
- Yeah, right.

58:52.181 --> 58:53.449
Yeah, it is.

58:53.516 --> 58:55.752
Sal, I need a little bit
more crazy eyes.

58:58.354 --> 59:00.189
- Has anybody seen him?
- Can I see your tattoo?

59:00.256 --> 59:01.691
I gotta meet him.
I gotta meet him.

59:01.758 --> 59:03.259
Yo, pal, do you know
when the Q&A is with Jaden?

59:03.326 --> 59:04.827
Do you know when the Q&A is?

59:06.229 --> 59:07.764
It's just wait and hold.

59:07.830 --> 59:09.165
Wait and hold?

59:09.232 --> 59:10.533
- Do you know where Jaden is?
- What?

59:10.600 --> 59:12.034
- Do you know where Jaden is?
- I don't.

59:12.101 --> 59:13.002
- I'm so sorry.
- You're no help to me.

59:15.571 --> 59:18.608
Jaden's movie has now ended,
and there's a Q&A afterward.

59:18.674 --> 59:20.710
- <i>This is awesome.</i>
- <i>There he is.</i>

59:20.777 --> 59:23.079
<i>There's Jaden.</i>

59:23.146 --> 59:25.848
Before we do that,
I just wanted to start off...

59:25.915 --> 59:28.518
Um...

59:28.584 --> 59:29.519
<i>Hop up, Sal.</i>

59:30.888 --> 59:32.488
So I have
a million questions,

59:32.555 --> 59:34.858
but do we have some questions
out here from the audience?

59:34.924 --> 59:36.125
Come on, buddy.
Get into it.

59:36.192 --> 59:37.895
- Oh! Oh!
- Do we have a really good one?

59:37.960 --> 59:39.128
So we have a question
right over here.

59:39.195 --> 59:41.297
Oh, yes!
Yes!

59:41.831 --> 59:42.999
Whoo!

59:45.201 --> 59:47.036
I'm just the number one
Jaden Smith fan.

59:47.103 --> 59:49.539
I'm just Jaden's
number one fan.

59:49.605 --> 59:50.540
Can we hug?

59:50.606 --> 59:52.175
Why don't you just
come on up here?

59:52.241 --> 59:53.409
Can I .really?
Oh, thank you guys so much!@

59:53.476 --> 59:55.244
- Would you guys mind?
- Come on up!

59:55.311 --> 59:56.813
- Thank you, thank you.
- <i>What Sal doesn't know</i>

59:56.880 --> 59:58.781
is that Jaden is in cahoots
with us this whole time

59:58.848 --> 1:00:00.851
- <i>Yes.</i>
- <i>Oh, look at those shorts.</i>

1:00:00.918 --> 1:00:04.687
Wow, wow.
Come on over.

1:00:04.754 --> 1:00:06.656
Come on over.
Wow.

1:00:06.722 --> 1:00:08.424
Thanks for coming out.

1:00:08.491 --> 1:00:10.393
Oh, cool.
This is very cool.

1:00:10.460 --> 1:00:13.529
Thank you so much.
Ah, bam!

1:00:13.596 --> 1:00:15.097
Wow.

1:00:15.164 --> 1:00:17.033
Are you serious?

1:00:17.099 --> 1:00:18.869
- That is...
- Oh, my God, ah!

1:00:18.936 --> 1:00:20.770
- Are you serious?
- Ah!

1:00:20.837 --> 1:00:22.371
<i>Are you serious?</i>

1:00:22.438 --> 1:00:23.941
I got this a few years ago.

1:00:24.006 --> 1:00:25.374
Been waiting to show it to you.

1:00:25.441 --> 1:00:27.343
I just feel like
I look a lot different.

1:00:27.410 --> 1:00:29.479
Maybe we could
get it, like, redone.

1:00:29.545 --> 1:00:31.781
Sal, just say, "Well, I do
have this other thigh."

1:00:31.848 --> 1:00:34.217
Revamped. Something.

1:00:34.283 --> 1:00:35.184
- <i>There you go, Sal.</i>
- Just 'cause it's old.

1:00:35.251 --> 1:00:36.586
It's just old.

1:00:36.652 --> 1:00:39.522
You know, I feel like
if it was newer...

1:00:40.423 --> 1:00:41.190
I...

1:00:41.257 --> 1:00:42.758
I do have this other thigh.

1:00:42.825 --> 1:00:44.360
I could get an updated one...

1:00:46.897 --> 1:00:49.098
You need anything, buddy?

1:00:50.299 --> 1:00:53.035
- I'm good, I guess.
- Not you.

1:00:53.102 --> 1:00:55.104
Yes, I'm fine, Joe.
Thank you.

1:00:57.573 --> 1:00:59.108
That's it,
I think we're done.

1:00:59.175 --> 1:01:00.376
Yeah!

1:01:00.443 --> 1:01:03.012
We did it!
We did it!

1:01:03.079 --> 1:01:05.147
- Oh!
- Oh, I gotta see this!

1:01:05.214 --> 1:01:06.182
Are you ready
to meet yourself?

1:01:06.249 --> 1:01:08.919
- Hold on.
- Three, two, one!

1:01:08.986 --> 1:01:12.288
Oh, my God!

1:01:13.689 --> 1:01:14.858
Whoa!

1:01:14.925 --> 1:01:16.626
That might be the best
tattoo I've ever seen.

1:01:16.692 --> 1:01:18.794
This is definitely better
than the last one.

1:01:20.429 --> 1:01:22.498
My guy.
My guy.

1:01:22.565 --> 1:01:24.667
Jaden, we'll see you
in five years?

1:01:24.734 --> 1:01:26.937
Oh, yeah.

1:01:27.004 --> 1:01:28.437
Hopefully before then.

1:01:41.183 --> 1:01:43.419
I know.
It's just like Ibiza.

1:01:43.486 --> 1:01:44.720
Hey, bud.
What's up?

1:01:46.756 --> 1:01:48.324
Is that the Molly?

1:01:48.391 --> 1:01:50.259
It's not the Molly.

1:01:50.326 --> 1:01:51.761
DJ, bring down the beat.

1:01:53.129 --> 1:01:55.598
Uh, what is this shit?

1:01:55.665 --> 1:01:56.766
What's that, bud?

1:01:58.167 --> 1:02:00.369
Hey, hey, hey!
Here we go!

1:02:00.436 --> 1:02:02.338
Now it's a party!
Later, Q.

1:02:02.973 --> 1:02:04.307
Okay.

1:02:04.373 --> 1:02:05.641
Yep, all right.

1:02:05.708 --> 1:02:07.209
So that's what
he does at night, okay.

1:02:34.037 --> 1:02:35.504
Good boy.

1:02:35.571 --> 1:02:37.874
Did you get the toys I sent?

1:02:38.741 --> 1:02:39.742
Okay.

1:02:39.809 --> 1:02:41.410
Oh, oh, Benjamin?

1:02:41.477 --> 1:02:44.280
Okay, don't,
don't hang up, don't hang up!

1:02:46.917 --> 1:02:48.051
He hung up.

1:02:48.117 --> 1:02:50.087
Well, Brian Quinn
misses his cats.

1:02:50.152 --> 1:02:51.554
Your cats.
I miss my family.

1:02:51.621 --> 1:02:53.189
You know my daughter McKayla?

1:02:53.255 --> 1:02:54.390
She rode her bike
for the first time yesterday.

1:02:54.457 --> 1:02:55.825
- Hmm.
- Wasn't there.

1:02:58.361 --> 1:03:00.563
- Milana?
- Who's that?

1:03:00.630 --> 1:03:03.066
Your daughter.

1:03:03.132 --> 1:03:04.433
Her name's Milana.

1:03:05.869 --> 1:03:07.370
Sweet Jesus.
How long have we been gone?

1:03:07.436 --> 1:03:09.572
- Three days.
- What are we doing?

1:03:09.639 --> 1:03:11.307
All right,
we're four grown men.

1:03:11.374 --> 1:03:12.842
We're out here jacking around,

1:03:12.909 --> 1:03:14.443
trying to fix a mistake
we made when we were kids.

1:03:14.510 --> 1:03:16.646
- It's stupid.
- Yeah, you know what?

1:03:16.712 --> 1:03:18.581
Maybe we didn't think
this one all the way through.

1:03:18.648 --> 1:03:20.516
I've been getting
phone numbers, girls.

1:03:20.583 --> 1:03:22.318
Local girls
that want to meet me.

1:03:22.385 --> 1:03:23.285
But if you guys want to leave
and go home,

1:03:23.352 --> 1:03:24.420
I'm ready to go now.

1:03:24.487 --> 1:03:26.389
- Yeah, yeah, me too.
- I'll go.

1:03:26.455 --> 1:03:27.790
Yeah, I gotta get back to
what's-her-face, come on.

1:03:27.858 --> 1:03:29.960
- All right.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1:03:30.027 --> 1:03:31.094
We're almost there.

1:03:31.160 --> 1:03:32.963
Sal, come on.
Going home, bud.

1:03:33.030 --> 1:03:33.964
- Come on, bud.
- No!

1:03:35.431 --> 1:03:37.700
We're not going anywhere!

1:03:37.767 --> 1:03:39.535
Sal, what are you doing?

1:03:41.470 --> 1:03:43.006
We're gonna finish
what we started.

1:03:43.073 --> 1:03:44.640
He's gone loco.

1:03:44.707 --> 1:03:48.111
I didn't come here all this
way to turn around, to quit!

1:03:48.177 --> 1:03:50.446
I'm not gonna go back home to
Staten Island so they can say,

1:03:50.513 --> 1:03:52.883
"You know that great guy,
Sal Vulcano

1:03:52.949 --> 1:03:55.518
and his friends that he has,
they turned around.

1:03:55.584 --> 1:03:59.522
They went all the way down
to Georgia."

1:04:00.857 --> 1:04:01.958
Not today, babies!

1:04:04.593 --> 1:04:06.796
- Oh.
- I did it.

1:04:08.464 --> 1:04:10.232
Shut the fuck up.

1:04:10.299 --> 1:04:11.600
It's fine, all right?
We'll stay.

1:04:11.667 --> 1:04:13.402
We'll keep going.
Whatever you need, buddy.

1:04:13.469 --> 1:04:15.072
We were just tired,
got a little homesick.

1:04:15.138 --> 1:04:16.873
Yeah.
Put the board down.

1:04:18.574 --> 1:04:20.843
Okay, great, 'cause as long
as we come to an agreement,

1:04:20.911 --> 1:04:22.278
'cause I just want
to see Abdul.

1:04:22.344 --> 1:04:23.846
- Communicate.
- Thank you guys.

1:04:23.914 --> 1:04:25.214
All you had to do is say
let's keep going, we'll go.

1:04:25.281 --> 1:04:26.782
- I get emotional.
- We'll do it.

1:04:26.849 --> 1:04:28.919
You weren't really gonna
hit us with that, were you?

1:04:28.985 --> 1:04:30.153
For me, it's unclear.

1:04:37.593 --> 1:04:39.963
I think this car breaks down
on the side of most roads,

1:04:40.030 --> 1:04:41.497
people are gonna stop and help.

1:04:41.564 --> 1:04:43.066
- I agree.
- Yeah, I think so.

1:04:43.133 --> 1:04:44.667
I think they will
stop to help,

1:04:44.734 --> 1:04:46.970
but the question is, how long
will they stick around?

1:04:47.037 --> 1:04:49.906
- Until, until it gets weird.
- Until it gets weird.

1:04:49.973 --> 1:04:51.807
How weird should we make it,
is the real question.

1:04:51.875 --> 1:04:54.443
- Guys, did we just make plans?
- I think we did.

1:04:54.510 --> 1:04:56.245
Pull over.

1:04:56.312 --> 1:04:58.380
- We got some work to do.
- You got it.

1:05:00.549 --> 1:05:02.351
Park it right here.
Let's do it.

1:05:06.990 --> 1:05:08.758
- <i>All right, here we go.</i>
- Here we go.

1:05:08.824 --> 1:05:10.459
<i>Sal, you broke down,
unfortunately, buddy.</i>

1:05:10.526 --> 1:05:12.095
Your object is to get people
to stop you to help you.

1:05:12.162 --> 1:05:14.497
Otherwise you're gonna be
standing down on the grass

1:05:14.563 --> 1:05:16.867
next to a car
getting bit by mosquitoes.

1:05:16.933 --> 1:05:19.368
All right, well,
the quickest way to do this

1:05:19.435 --> 1:05:20.904
is to just
make them stop, right?

1:05:20.971 --> 1:05:23.173
I'm proud of you, buddy.
You're taking some initiative.

1:05:23.240 --> 1:05:24.740
Whoo!

1:05:25.641 --> 1:05:28.310
She's, uh, she's dead.

1:05:28.377 --> 1:05:29.845
Whoo.

1:05:29.913 --> 1:05:32.581
She went down
a couple miles back.

1:05:36.153 --> 1:05:37.620
Hey, how you doing, man?

1:05:37.686 --> 1:05:40.422
It's two guys, and I think
they might want to kill me.

1:05:40.489 --> 1:05:41.690
Here we go.

1:05:41.757 --> 1:05:43.492
Can't do no harm, no foul.
Bill.

1:05:43.559 --> 1:05:44.861
Hey, how you doing, Bill?
Sal.

1:05:44.928 --> 1:05:46.529
Yeah, my name's Sal.

1:05:46.595 --> 1:05:47.964
- What's your name?
- Mark.

1:05:48.031 --> 1:05:49.431
Usually when something
goes wrong,

1:05:49.498 --> 1:05:50.800
I just blast something
up the tailpipe.

1:05:53.602 --> 1:05:54.770
Usually something goes wrong,
I just

1:05:54.837 --> 1:05:56.273
blast something
up the tailpipe.

1:05:56.338 --> 1:05:57.773
Up the tailpipe?

1:05:57.840 --> 1:05:59.508
Well, I mean,
first rule of thumb, right?

1:05:59.575 --> 1:06:00.810
You get broke down,
you gotta blast something

1:06:00.877 --> 1:06:02.344
right up the tailpipe,
and I was gonna

1:06:02.411 --> 1:06:03.612
blast something,
but I don't have nothing.

1:06:03.679 --> 1:06:04.981
That's what I thought you did.

1:06:05.048 --> 1:06:06.283
- No, no.
- No.

1:06:08.651 --> 1:06:10.586
<i>Guys, why isn't
this fixed yet?</i>

1:06:10.653 --> 1:06:13.190
<i>Yeah, Sal...</i>

1:06:13.256 --> 1:06:14.690
I don't know,
I don't even...

1:06:14.757 --> 1:06:16.026
I wish I knew more
about the thing.

1:06:16.092 --> 1:06:17.793
Well, what's the issue?
It's, I mean...

1:06:17.861 --> 1:06:19.129
I mean, you can't fix it
already or what's going on?

1:06:19.196 --> 1:06:20.629
We don't know
what it's doing.

1:06:20.696 --> 1:06:22.498
I mean, you know,
guys, you've been here

1:06:22.565 --> 1:06:24.267
a couple minutes already, guys.

1:06:24.333 --> 1:06:25.801
Tick-tock, Bill.

1:06:25.869 --> 1:06:27.270
This is really nice of
you guys, 'cause, you know,

1:06:27.336 --> 1:06:28.737
I never would've stopped
for you guys.

1:06:31.274 --> 1:06:33.442
I mean, I gotta be honest,
you fellas are top-notch.

1:06:33.509 --> 1:06:34.610
It's...

1:06:34.677 --> 1:06:36.012
Sal, you gonna say
that line or no?

1:06:36.079 --> 1:06:37.847
<i>Here we go, oh.</i>

1:06:37.914 --> 1:06:40.083
I wouldn't have stopped for you
guys, so that's really nice.

1:06:41.450 --> 1:06:42.853
There wouldn't be no use
to stopping.

1:06:42.919 --> 1:06:44.653
Yeah, right, right,
right, right, right.

1:06:44.720 --> 1:06:46.857
The only thing I could suggest
if you guys were stuck,

1:06:46.923 --> 1:06:48.859
you could blast something
up your tailpipe, though.

1:06:50.060 --> 1:06:51.760
All right, bud,
head around to the trunk.

1:06:51.827 --> 1:06:53.662
We've hidden something
in there for him.

1:06:53.729 --> 1:06:55.764
I think I got something here.
Let me see.

1:07:01.670 --> 1:07:03.173
What the hell is that?

1:07:03.240 --> 1:07:04.740
Okay.

1:07:08.677 --> 1:07:10.247
Yeah, there's no string...

1:07:10.313 --> 1:07:11.780
So, Sal, in the backseat,

1:07:11.847 --> 1:07:12.916
we put a check
for good Samaritans.

1:07:12.983 --> 1:07:15.384
This is, guys...
Mark, Bill...

1:07:15.451 --> 1:07:16.920
This is the check

1:07:18.088 --> 1:07:21.124
for good Samaritans
who stopped

1:07:21.191 --> 1:07:22.725
and pulled over to help me.

1:07:22.791 --> 1:07:24.760
This is a check for 5...

1:07:24.827 --> 1:07:27.097
Take that, Mark, go ahead.

1:07:28.464 --> 1:07:29.698
Hello.

1:07:29.765 --> 1:07:32.168
Mark's still rocking a flip.

1:07:32.235 --> 1:07:34.938
You took the call right in the
middle of the check ceremony.

1:07:35.005 --> 1:07:36.538
So anyway, guys, this is

1:07:36.605 --> 1:07:38.141
from the Staten Island
Credit Union,

1:07:38.208 --> 1:07:39.775
this is a Good Samaritan check

1:07:39.842 --> 1:07:41.311
for $5,000

1:07:41.378 --> 1:07:42.745
for helping people in need.

1:07:42.811 --> 1:07:44.047
- Ain't legal tender.
- <i>Try to rip it.</i>

1:07:44.114 --> 1:07:45.614
You don't want it?
'Cause I'll...

1:07:45.681 --> 1:07:47.683
Yeah, yeah, don't tear that,
don't tear that.

1:07:47.750 --> 1:07:49.551
<i>Oh.</i>

1:07:49.618 --> 1:07:51.087
Thank you.
Bill, that's for you, man.

1:07:55.392 --> 1:07:56.692
Murr,
you're walking funny.

1:07:56.759 --> 1:07:58.094
Yeah, no kidding
I'm walking funny, Joe.

1:07:58.161 --> 1:07:59.561
Is it because of that thong
we put on you?

1:07:59.628 --> 1:08:00.829
What thong?
This thong?

1:08:00.897 --> 1:08:02.665
There it is.

1:08:03.333 --> 1:08:04.700
Dude, thank you.

1:08:04.767 --> 1:08:06.403
What's your name, bud?
What is it? I'm sorry.

1:08:06.468 --> 1:08:07.670
- Dennis.
- Dennis, I'm James.

1:08:07.736 --> 1:08:09.005
I appreciate
you stopping, Denise.

1:08:09.072 --> 1:08:10.839
I appreciate you stopping...

1:08:12.876 --> 1:08:14.476
I appreciate you
stopping, Denise.

1:08:14.543 --> 1:08:16.079
I don't know
the first thing.

1:08:16.146 --> 1:08:17.813
Come around here, I'll show you
what I noticed before.

1:08:17.881 --> 1:08:20.317
I noticed that before it was
smoking primarily from

1:08:20.383 --> 1:08:21.450
from this area here.

1:08:21.517 --> 1:08:22.618
I ain't got time
for this, man.

1:08:22.685 --> 1:08:24.187
- I don't even know.
- No?

1:08:27.891 --> 1:08:29.426
- <i>Murr loses again.</i>
- Son of a bitch.

1:08:29.491 --> 1:08:30.759
Did I just lose?

1:08:30.826 --> 1:08:32.329
Did I just lose?
A thong was his weakness?

1:08:32.395 --> 1:08:34.530
- <i>Murr, you gotta go again.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

1:08:34.596 --> 1:08:36.799
What, is this like
double or nothing?

1:08:36.866 --> 1:08:38.935
Thank you so much, man.
I appreciate it.

1:08:39.002 --> 1:08:40.602
- James. Nice to meet you, bud.
- Good to meet you, man.

1:08:40.669 --> 1:08:42.038
Here's what happened,
so I'm driving before.

1:08:42.105 --> 1:08:44.341
But I don't even know
what I'm looking at, bro.

1:08:44.407 --> 1:08:45.774
Want to have a laugh?

1:08:45.841 --> 1:08:47.576
Fake strangle me
when the next car pulls by.

1:08:47.643 --> 1:08:48.744
You want to have
a little fun? Watch.

1:08:48.811 --> 1:08:50.447
Okay, okay, okay, go.

1:08:50.512 --> 1:08:52.248
When this guy pulls by, pretend
you're strangling me, okay?

1:08:52.315 --> 1:08:53.749
Gonna do it.

1:08:53.816 --> 1:08:55.484
<i>Flail your arms.
Flail your arms!</i>

1:08:55.551 --> 1:08:57.887
- <i>Flail, your arms.</i>
- No, keep going. Don't stop now!

1:09:02.959 --> 1:09:05.028
<i>Dude!</i>

1:09:06.528 --> 1:09:07.596
Nailed it.

1:09:07.663 --> 1:09:09.698
Thanks, bud.
That was awesome.

1:09:09.765 --> 1:09:11.567
You know what, dude, I'm so
glad that you pulled over.

1:09:11.633 --> 1:09:13.069
I'm so glad you pulled over.

1:09:13.136 --> 1:09:14.737
I was afraid it was
gonna be a woman and then...

1:09:14.803 --> 1:09:16.239
I was afraid...
Nope, nope.

1:09:17.706 --> 1:09:19.009
Nope, nope, nope.

1:09:21.777 --> 1:09:23.679
<i>Car's a real lemon
right now, buddy.</i>

1:09:23.746 --> 1:09:25.949
There you go.

1:09:26.016 --> 1:09:27.951
Oh, oh.

1:09:28.018 --> 1:09:28.985
Oh, thank God.

1:09:29.052 --> 1:09:30.519
Jump up and down
you're so excited.

1:09:30.586 --> 1:09:33.722
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oh, yay.

1:09:33.789 --> 1:09:35.225
Clap, clap, clap.

1:09:35.291 --> 1:09:37.027
Yeah, yeah.

1:09:37.093 --> 1:09:38.895
Turn around, do it
in circles, do it in circles.

1:09:38.962 --> 1:09:41.797
I have been waiting for
somebody to pull over so long.

1:09:41.865 --> 1:09:43.933
Oh, yes!

1:09:45.768 --> 1:09:47.404
Dude, thank you so much.

1:09:47.470 --> 1:09:49.339
Yay.
I love this car, man.

1:09:49.406 --> 1:09:51.875
I've had this car for so long,
and then I was riding,

1:09:51.941 --> 1:09:53.510
I hit a bump,
and then it just...

1:09:53.609 --> 1:09:54.643
It just died.
It won't go again.

1:09:54.710 --> 1:09:56.046
You believe that?

1:09:56.112 --> 1:09:57.813
The old wagon's
down for the count.

1:09:57.881 --> 1:09:59.082
It's just dead, man.

1:09:59.149 --> 1:10:00.316
The wagon's
down for the count.

1:10:00.383 --> 1:10:02.485
Yeah.

1:10:02.551 --> 1:10:04.354
I lost my virginity
in this car.

1:10:04.421 --> 1:10:05.922
So did my older brother.

1:10:05.989 --> 1:10:07.490
- So did my older brother.
- <i>My younger brother.</i>

1:10:07.556 --> 1:10:09.259
- So did my younger brother.
- <i>My sister did.</i>

1:10:09.325 --> 1:10:11.027
My sis,
my sister did.

1:10:11.094 --> 1:10:12.728
It was a hell of a night.

1:10:12.795 --> 1:10:13.997
It was a hell of a night.

1:10:14.064 --> 1:10:15.831
It was,

1:10:15.899 --> 1:10:16.832
it was a hell of a night.

1:10:16.900 --> 1:10:19.135
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1:10:19.202 --> 1:10:20.736
You know what I got
in the trunk?

1:10:20.803 --> 1:10:22.038
Yeah, show him
what you have in the trunk.

1:10:24.340 --> 1:10:26.642
<i>Yeah, that's about
a hundred pounds of cocaine,</i>

1:10:26.708 --> 1:10:28.278
and bags full of cash.

1:10:28.344 --> 1:10:33.116
What we have here is about
a hundred pounds of cocaine...

1:10:33.183 --> 1:10:34.517
You're not DEA, are you?

1:10:34.583 --> 1:10:36.186
You don't work
for the fuzz, do you?

1:10:38.221 --> 1:10:39.422
I'll tell you what, bro.

1:10:39.489 --> 1:10:40.957
- You didn't see nothing.
- Put that back in the car.

1:10:41.024 --> 1:10:41.991
Hurry up.
Here comes a bus.

1:10:42.058 --> 1:10:44.127
This is... A bus?
Oh, shit.

1:10:45.395 --> 1:10:47.897
Do you think anybody saw me?

1:10:47.964 --> 1:10:49.466
Do you think they saw my face?

1:10:52.601 --> 1:10:54.636
You never saw me!

1:11:02.811 --> 1:11:06.648
Guys, this is,
this is a whole thing.

1:11:06.715 --> 1:11:09.586
Joe, for no reason,
stop traffic

1:11:09.651 --> 1:11:11.254
and let cars go
indiscriminately.

1:11:11.321 --> 1:11:12.956
Let's stop a car.

1:11:13.022 --> 1:11:14.690
He's gonna walk
right into the road.

1:11:16.159 --> 1:11:18.760
Okay, take it easy.
I got 17 cars.

1:11:20.463 --> 1:11:22.532
You're in.

1:11:22.599 --> 1:11:23.732
Good.

1:11:23.799 --> 1:11:25.667
Good, good, good.

1:11:25.734 --> 1:11:28.138
Come on, come on.

1:11:29.906 --> 1:11:31.307
Come on, come on, stop.

1:11:35.744 --> 1:11:37.080
There you go.

1:11:37.147 --> 1:11:38.647
Joe, both arms, windmill,
opposite directions.

1:11:38.714 --> 1:11:42.051
There you go.
There you go.

1:11:42.118 --> 1:11:44.053
Guys, nobody will stop
to help me.

1:11:44.120 --> 1:11:46.122
What are you doing?

1:11:46.189 --> 1:11:48.024
Okay, this guy
just pulled over.

1:11:51.628 --> 1:11:53.196
- Hi, I'm Joe.
- Mitch.

1:11:53.263 --> 1:11:55.098
Mitch, good to see you, pal.
So the problem was I was...

1:11:55.165 --> 1:11:56.798
I was driving down this road.

1:11:56.866 --> 1:11:58.134
Keep him walking
around the whole car.

1:11:58.201 --> 1:12:00.069
And then when I saw it,
I hit a bump.

1:12:00.136 --> 1:12:01.803
And then I heard
a da-dunk-dunk-dunk.

1:12:01.871 --> 1:12:03.640
Come on.
And a hit a buh-bump-bump.

1:12:03.705 --> 1:12:06.209
And then when I hit it,
I heard a jiggle-jiggle here.

1:12:06.276 --> 1:12:07.243
There was a jiggle.

1:12:07.310 --> 1:12:08.478
Take him around
the whole car.

1:12:08.545 --> 1:12:09.811
Then on the other side here...

1:12:09.879 --> 1:12:11.548
Joe, I need,
I need two full rotations.

1:12:11.614 --> 1:12:12.982
This is here,
this is one car.

1:12:13.049 --> 1:12:14.551
- This is one.
- Come on, take a walk with me.

1:12:14.617 --> 1:12:16.920
So I saw back here that
this wheel started to like,

1:12:16.986 --> 1:12:18.820
if you look, like,
this is on pretty good.

1:12:18.888 --> 1:12:20.323
- Okay.
- But the other one,

1:12:20.390 --> 1:12:21.891
come on here, Mitch,
let me show you real quick.

1:12:21.958 --> 1:12:23.359
Oh, no, now you went
the other way. Shit.

1:12:23.426 --> 1:12:25.827
- He's undoing it, Joe!
- You're undoing...

1:12:25.895 --> 1:12:27.297
You're undoing the loop.
No, you gotta come this way.

1:12:27.363 --> 1:12:28.898
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- So now we're back on track.

1:12:28.965 --> 1:12:30.832
So this will be
a second rotation, yeah.

1:12:30.900 --> 1:12:32.035
This hubcap is off.

1:12:32.101 --> 1:12:33.870
The other side,
the two came off.

1:12:33.937 --> 1:12:36.039
- Okay.
- This one here, hubcap.

1:12:36.105 --> 1:12:37.540
So I got two hubcaps.
So now...

1:12:37.607 --> 1:12:39.708
I think I actually need
three rotations, Joe.

1:12:39.775 --> 1:12:41.611
Damn it.
How many rotations?

1:12:41.678 --> 1:12:42.979
You need one more.

1:12:43.046 --> 1:12:44.414
What are you trying
to accomplish here, Joe?

1:12:44.480 --> 1:12:45.714
- Oh, me?
- Yeah.

1:12:45.781 --> 1:12:47.183
Oh, no, I'm trying to get
the car to start.

1:12:47.250 --> 1:12:48.318
But I walked you through
what happened, come here.

1:12:48.384 --> 1:12:49.552
Mitch, Mitch...

1:12:49.619 --> 1:12:51.321
You gotta look at this,
Mitch. Mitch, Mitch!

1:12:51.387 --> 1:12:53.456
- Hold on, hold on.
- Joe, start hiding from him.

1:12:53.523 --> 1:12:55.124
But I don't need...

1:12:55.191 --> 1:12:56.559
<i>Joe, he's not
gonna chase you.</i>

1:12:56.626 --> 1:12:57.961
- <i>Come on, Joe!</i>
- Hey, man,

1:12:58.027 --> 1:13:00.563
you're gonna make me
leave you, man, okay?

1:13:00.630 --> 1:13:02.865
- Hey, man, I'm gone, man.
- No, no, Mitch, look at this!

1:13:02.932 --> 1:13:05.335
No.

1:13:05.401 --> 1:13:07.136
Mitch, but look, you gotta
look at this last one.

1:13:07.203 --> 1:13:08.638
- Come here.
- Mitch.

1:13:08.705 --> 1:13:10.006
Mitch, you're my best friend.

1:13:10.073 --> 1:13:12.041
We're best friends, Mitch.
Mitch.

1:13:12.108 --> 1:13:13.809
All I'm trying to do
is help you.

1:13:13.876 --> 1:13:15.144
- <i>I know, I'm trying...</i>
- <i>You want to help me,</i>

1:13:15.211 --> 1:13:16.613
go around the car
one more time!

1:13:16.679 --> 1:13:17.614
- One more time.
- Okay?

1:13:17.680 --> 1:13:18.881
- Guess what.
- What?

1:13:18.948 --> 1:13:20.650
- You gotta follow me.
- Okay. Deal.

1:13:20.717 --> 1:13:22.485
I'm following you, Mitch.

1:13:22.552 --> 1:13:23.785
- Joe...
- It's okay.

1:13:23.853 --> 1:13:25.388
Joe, after this,
I'm going home.

1:13:25.455 --> 1:13:27.290
Okay, you accomplished
your goal.

1:13:27.357 --> 1:13:29.158
I did.
I did accomplish my goal.

1:13:29.225 --> 1:13:30.660
- And you have a good day.
- That's it.

1:13:30.727 --> 1:13:32.662
Mitch,
you're unbelievable, buddy.

1:13:32.729 --> 1:13:33.863
Thank you so much.

1:13:33.930 --> 1:13:35.398

Oh, it turns out
there was only three tickets.

Okay, so when you're making
a balsamic reduction,

1:17:03.840 --> 1:17:05.842
you really want to have
the flame at a nice simmer.

1:17:05.909 --> 1:17:07.543
If the heat is too hot,
it's not gonna reduce

1:17:07.610 --> 1:17:09.145
the way you want it,
and the most important part

1:17:09.212 --> 1:17:11.247
is to put the drizzle
right when it's hot.

1:17:11.314 --> 1:17:13.549
And that's chicken, salads,
fish dishes, whatever?

1:17:13.616 --> 1:17:15.785
Any dish.
It's about the presentaish.

1:17:59.762 --> 1:18:01.063

1:18:01.130 --> 1:18:02.665
Kinda getting back into it
a little bit.

1:18:02.732 --> 1:18:03.799
It looks like you're hurt.

1:18:03.867 --> 1:18:05.501
Nah, I feel great.

1:18:05.568 --> 1:18:08.204
- That does not look like you think it looks, buddy.
- Yeah.

1:18:08.271 --> 1:18:10.072
I don't know
if I agree with you.

1:18:10.139 --> 1:18:12.742
Everyone here agrees with us.

1:18:13.676 --> 1:18:15.077
All right, all right.

1:18:15.144 --> 1:18:16.479
All right,
we need Murray back,

1:18:16.546 --> 1:18:18.147
'cause we're starting
to turn on each other.

1:18:18.214 --> 1:18:19.448
You know, it just doesn't
feel right without Murr.

1:18:19.515 --> 1:18:21.150
Because he's not here,
I'll admit it.

1:18:21.217 --> 1:18:22.451
I miss him a little.

1:18:22.518 --> 1:18:24.287
What are we even
still doing here?

1:18:24.353 --> 1:18:25.788
We accomplished
what we set out to do.

1:18:25.856 --> 1:18:28.257
We didn't mess up the night.
I'm not having fun.

1:18:28.324 --> 1:18:30.593
We're nowhere near
Paula anyway.

1:18:30.660 --> 1:18:33.329
Why don't we make like a tree
and go make fun of Murray?

1:18:33.396 --> 1:18:35.231
- Yeah.
- All right.

1:18:43.139 --> 1:18:46.208
Look at this vanilla angel.

1:18:47.044 --> 1:18:48.544
He's magnificent.

1:18:48.611 --> 1:18:50.513

luminous ferret.

1:18:50.580 --> 1:18:52.848

1:18:54.684 --> 1:18:56.752
You just had to come,
didn't you?

1:18:56.819 --> 1:18:58.421

1:18:58.487 --> 1:19:00.356
I mean, you lost
and you show up?

1:19:00.423 --> 1:19:02.124
- What about the rules?
- Yeah, I mean...

1:19:02.191 --> 1:19:04.126
we're gonna pass Go
and collect $200?

1:19:04.193 --> 1:19:05.328
We're breaking rules?

1:19:05.394 --> 1:19:06.729
I'm not playing Monopoly
like that!

1:19:06.796 --> 1:19:08.031
Really?

1:19:08.097 --> 1:19:09.565

would be realizing

1:19:09.632 --> 1:19:11.133
that the four of us
are better together.

1:19:11.200 --> 1:19:13.971

1:21:29.039 --> 1:21:30.239
They're in the house,

1:21:30.306 --> 1:21:32.508
and they drove

What a night!

1:22:25.628 --> 1:22:27.130
- Yes!
- Unbelievable.

1:22:27.197 --> 1:22:30.066
Man, I'm so glad I threatened
your lives with that 2x4.

1:22:31.268 --> 1:22:33.136

- Yeah.

1:22:33.203 --> 1:22:34.204
You're my best friends.

1:22:34.271 --> 1:22:35.872
Epic, epic night, guys.

1:22:35.939 --> 1:22:39.809
Yeah, I don't say
this enough, but I... I...

1:22:39.876 --> 1:22:42.078
Hey, Fatone, you mind
keeping it down back there?

1:22:42.145 --> 1:22:44.547
- We're trying to have a moment.
- Sorry.

1:22:44.613 --> 1:22:46.682
I thought
I had known everything

1:22:46.749 --> 1:22:48.051
there was to know about us,

1:22:48.118 --> 1:22:49.618
but I learned
a few things on this trip.

1:22:49.685 --> 1:22:51.353
Sal loves tigers.

1:22:51.420 --> 1:22:54.723
Yeah, Murr loves going to strip
clubs with his young nieces.

1:22:54.790 --> 1:22:56.725
Q's parents love
softcore porn.

1:22:56.792 --> 1:22:58.295
- No, no, they do not.
- They do.

1:22:58.360 --> 1:22:59.963
- They do not. They do not.
- They do, they produce it.

1:23:00.030 --> 1:23:01.764
I'll tell you
what the biggest thing, though,

1:23:01.831 --> 1:23:03.399
that surprised me
was how good of a hype man

1:23:03.465 --> 1:23:05.467
- Joe turned out to be after all.
- Right?

1:23:05.534 --> 1:23:08.470
Not bad, buddy.

1:23:08.537 --> 1:23:10.974
I should talk to you boys
about something.

1:23:11.041 --> 1:23:12.541
An offer came in.

1:23:12.608 --> 1:23:14.376
Abdul wants me to go
full-time as her hype man.

1:23:14.443 --> 1:23:16.545
World tour.
Unbelievable.

1:23:16.612 --> 1:23:19.415
Seven-figure salary,
401(k), full benefits.

1:23:19.481 --> 1:23:21.617
Everything.

1:23:21.684 --> 1:23:24.653
You know, she even offered me
my own reality show.

1:23:24.720 --> 1:23:27.356
"Believe the Hype:
The Joe Gatto Story."

1:23:27.423 --> 1:23:29.425
I got a tricycle for McKayla.

1:23:29.491 --> 1:23:30.659
Milana.

1:23:30.726 --> 1:23:32.828
My own helicopter
they're flying in.

1:23:34.097 --> 1:23:35.631
She's gonna get rid
of that tapeworm.

1:23:35.698 --> 1:23:37.499
Oh, you've had that
for years.

1:23:37.566 --> 1:23:38.869
Bye-bye, Charlie.

1:23:38.935 --> 1:23:41.837
Everything I ever wanted
as a full-blown hype man

1:23:41.905 --> 1:23:43.606
delivered on a silver platter.

1:23:43.672 --> 1:23:45.175
Well, what did you say
to her?

1:23:49.346 --> 1:23:50.881
- I said no.
- Oh, thank God!

1:23:50.947 --> 1:23:52.249
I don't want to do it.
She said, "What are you doing?"

1:23:52.315 --> 1:23:53.316
I said,
"I'm forever their boy."

1:23:53.382 --> 1:23:55.051
I straight up told her no-no.

1:23:55.118 --> 1:23:56.152
You know what?

1:23:57.386 --> 1:23:59.155
It's time to go back
to Staten Island.

1:23:59.222 --> 1:24:00.456
Yes, it is.

1:24:00.522 --> 1:24:01.858
Let me just go gas up
Grandma Lucia.

1:24:01.925 --> 1:24:03.626
- We'll hit the road.
- Hold on, fellas.

1:24:03.692 --> 1:24:07.463
Abdul texted me tickets
to go on her private plane.

1:24:07.529 --> 1:24:08.797
- Oh, all right.
- Oh!

1:24:08.865 --> 1:24:10.466
- That's awesome.
- Wait, wait, wait.

1:24:10.532 --> 1:24:12.869
She sent three tickets.
Come on!

1:24:12.936 --> 1:24:14.503
Is she kidding me?

1:24:14.570 --> 1:24:15.804
- And it goes on.
- This is on purpose, right?

1:24:15.872 --> 1:24:17.908
- Does she watch the show?
- Oh, that's great.

1:24:17.974 --> 1:24:19.376
Well, there's four of us.
That's an issue.

1:24:19.441 --> 1:24:20.409
Well, then how
are we gonna decide

1:24:20.476 --> 1:24:21.912
who gets to go on the plane?

1:24:21.978 --> 1:24:23.746
- I think it's been decided.
- Yeah, pretty sure.

1:24:23.812 --> 1:24:25.248
- What do you mean?
- Did you not watch the movie?

1:24:25.315 --> 1:24:27.117
- That's for real, like...
- Yes.

1:24:27.183 --> 1:24:29.585
- Yes, our show is real.
- But that's for real?

1:24:29.652 --> 1:24:31.420
You think you have a shot
at a private?

1:24:31.487 --> 1:24:33.189
