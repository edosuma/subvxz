WEBVTT

01:03.364 --> 01:05.631
Listen, I already told you

01:05.633 --> 01:08.100
that until I see the money,

01:08.102 --> 01:09.768
there's no offer on the table.

01:09.770 --> 01:11.770
- Fuck that.
- Excuse me?

01:11.772 --> 01:14.373
- This is what you want.
- No, I don't!

01:14.375 --> 01:16.241
- You want this.
- And don't you touch me!

01:16.243 --> 01:18.394
- Fine.
- You piece of shit.

01:18.395 --> 01:20.546
- Is this what you want?
- Ah!

01:23.651 --> 01:24.651
Fuck you, bum.

01:31.792 --> 01:33.258
Come on, let me help you.

01:33.260 --> 01:34.393
Yeah, okay.

01:45.539 --> 01:48.874
Bridget, you're just
not seeing this clearly,

01:50.611 --> 01:52.344
so let's do it like this.

01:52.346 --> 01:55.848
The weapons that we use
to defend our country,

01:55.850 --> 01:58.550
if they were to fall in the
hands of, let's say,

01:58.552 --> 02:02.588
the bad guys, they could
utterly destroy us

02:02.590 --> 02:04.823
and all of our citizens.

02:04.825 --> 02:06.892
So ensuring that the guns

02:06.894 --> 02:09.161
stay out of the
hands of the bad men

02:09.163 --> 02:12.297
should be of highest
priority, should it not?

02:12.299 --> 02:14.700
Do you think there is
a way to control this?

02:14.702 --> 02:17.603
Every time the government has
tried to control anything,

02:17.605 --> 02:20.873
it has failed; Be
it drugs, alcohol,

02:20.875 --> 02:23.575
pretty much anything
they've ever tried, right?

02:23.577 --> 02:26.578
That's because we are
dealing with an absolute.

02:26.580 --> 02:29.348
You cannot control
everything all the time.

02:29.350 --> 02:32.184
You may be able to control
some things some of the time,

02:32.186 --> 02:34.853
but you cannot control
everything all the time.

02:34.855 --> 02:36.588
There is always leakage.

02:36.590 --> 02:37.856
I get that!

02:37.858 --> 02:39.791
But we know, all right?

02:39.793 --> 02:42.761
We know that they're
selling this technology

02:42.763 --> 02:44.596
to the highest bidder.

02:44.598 --> 02:49.334
And for God sakes, they're
already ordering new bodies.

02:49.336 --> 02:52.738
Now, I don't understand how
this is even a conversation.

02:52.740 --> 02:55.941
There's just no reasoning
with you, is there?

02:57.545 --> 02:58.777
None at all.

02:58.779 --> 03:01.914
Someone, anyone, please,
help her see the damage

03:01.916 --> 03:04.349
that this company would suffer

03:04.351 --> 03:06.752
if we were to derail this deal.

03:06.754 --> 03:08.687
Please, anyone, speak up.

03:08.689 --> 03:09.821
How 'bout down there?

03:09.823 --> 03:11.390
Hey!

03:11.392 --> 03:12.691
You guys awake down there?

03:13.627 --> 03:14.627
Anyone?

03:15.896 --> 03:16.896
Magnus?

03:19.366 --> 03:21.600
Look, you know my stand.

03:22.803 --> 03:26.271
If this would have been
available just three years ago,

03:26.273 --> 03:28.574
my wife could've
had a second chance.

03:29.944 --> 03:32.744
We simply can't stop right now.

03:33.781 --> 03:37.516
We can't stop right now!

03:39.253 --> 03:41.386
The purpose of developing
this technology

03:41.388 --> 03:43.255
was never so that we
could play God, Magnus.

03:43.257 --> 03:46.258
Oh, shit.

03:46.260 --> 03:47.659
No, I'm sorry.

03:49.330 --> 03:52.331
But I suggest not only
do we not move forward

03:52.333 --> 03:53.699
with this merger,

03:53.701 --> 03:55.400
but we should be pursuing
further investigation

03:55.402 --> 03:56.468
into Intragenetica.

03:56.470 --> 03:57.936
What we have suspicions of

03:57.938 --> 03:59.605
is not only frightening
and immoral,

03:59.607 --> 04:01.807
it is also very illegal.

04:01.809 --> 04:03.575
And I'm very concerned
so many of you

04:03.577 --> 04:05.611
are still wanting
to move forward.

04:06.947 --> 04:08.880
My father founded this company.

04:10.851 --> 04:14.753
He had a very strong
moral compass,

04:16.690 --> 04:17.690
as do I.

04:20.293 --> 04:22.694
And I will not be moved.

04:23.864 --> 04:24.997
I vote no.

04:24.999 --> 04:27.566
- This meeting is adjourned.
- Yeah.

04:27.568 --> 04:28.568
Adjourned.

04:32.606 --> 04:35.507
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

04:50.858 --> 04:54.593
Always let your heart
and your gut guide you.

04:54.595 --> 04:57.863
Your brain is not the best
place for decision making.

04:59.633 --> 05:00.699
Thank you.

05:28.495 --> 05:30.095
Here you go.

05:48.649 --> 05:49.981
Nope, come on!

05:55.789 --> 05:57.422
Hey, here.

06:01.662 --> 06:02.728
It's nice and warm.

06:04.798 --> 06:08.133
Thanks.

06:08.135 --> 06:11.069
Well, you know where to find me.

06:18.078 --> 06:19.544
Thanks, again.

06:19.546 --> 06:21.880
I'm not so used
to people caring.

06:21.882 --> 06:22.882
It means a lot.

06:24.084 --> 06:26.752
Yeah, I hear ya.

06:30.624 --> 06:33.024
What were ya doin'
down there anyway?

06:36.563 --> 06:37.696
Long story.

06:37.698 --> 06:39.030
Well, I got time.

06:40.968 --> 06:45.704
Look, I don't wanna
bore you with my life.

06:49.109 --> 06:51.710
It's not a very,

06:51.712 --> 06:53.512
it's not a very
motivational story.

06:54.448 --> 06:55.714
Motivational.

06:57.117 --> 07:00.719
Well, ya see, maybe
that's just it.

07:00.721 --> 07:01.953
Your story isn't over yet.

07:03.624 --> 07:05.190
The best is yet to come.

07:09.196 --> 07:10.196
Maybe.

07:14.902 --> 07:17.536
You don't say much, do you?

07:19.506 --> 07:20.506
I guess.

07:22.476 --> 07:24.075
I guess I'm not
much of a talker.

07:28.015 --> 07:29.915
Well, if ya wanna be friends,

07:29.917 --> 07:31.683
ya need to talk a little bit.

07:39.159 --> 07:40.159
See.

07:42.496 --> 07:44.563
Tell me something about you.

07:49.169 --> 07:50.169
I'm replaceable.

08:05.686 --> 08:07.252
Man, I don't know.

08:07.254 --> 08:08.854
Bridget's got the veto vote.

08:09.957 --> 08:10.957
So what next?

08:15.095 --> 08:17.562
I told you this was coming.

08:17.564 --> 08:20.799
We need to arrange
for a little accident,

08:20.801 --> 08:23.235
like I said in the first place.

08:23.237 --> 08:24.569
Come on, Oliver.

08:24.571 --> 08:26.071
It's a little drastic,
don't ya think?

08:26.940 --> 08:28.673
Well, we're running outta time

08:28.675 --> 08:30.942
and, frankly, we're
running out of options.

08:30.944 --> 08:32.277
Do you have a better idea?

08:34.681 --> 08:36.014
I can talk to her again.

08:40.687 --> 08:43.989
All right, here's the deal.

08:43.991 --> 08:46.691
You do that, you talk to her.

08:46.693 --> 08:47.826
But if you don't get anywhere,

08:47.828 --> 08:49.628
I will decide our next move.

08:52.232 --> 08:54.032
All right, give me a few days.

08:55.102 --> 08:56.568
You have two.

09:04.311 --> 09:06.111
Okay, all right.

09:07.247 --> 09:09.714
But you don't have
to take this stand.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.016
It doesn't have
to be your fight.

09:11.018 --> 09:14.185
No, it didn't have
to be my fight,

09:14.187 --> 09:15.787
but they made it my fight.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.123
What am I supposed to do, Mark?

09:18.125 --> 09:19.991
Just pretend I don't
know what I know?

09:19.993 --> 09:22.127
No, I can't do that.

09:22.129 --> 09:24.262
Obviously, you
know what you know,

09:24.264 --> 09:25.864
but what about everyone else?

09:25.866 --> 09:27.299
Why can't they do this?

09:27.301 --> 09:28.301
Why you?

09:30.003 --> 09:32.771
My father said something
to me when I was little.

09:32.773 --> 09:33.638
You know what that was?

09:33.640 --> 09:34.606
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

09:34.608 --> 09:36.007
The way you do anything

09:36.009 --> 09:38.310
is the way you do everything.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.346
Hey, that's a great
philosophy, but.

09:41.348 --> 09:44.249
No, honey, there are no buts.

09:45.752 --> 09:48.353
How could I look Miranda in
the eye if I let this go?

09:50.891 --> 09:52.757
Okay, I'm not hungry.

09:52.759 --> 09:53.692
I ate late today.

09:53.694 --> 09:54.826
Leah brought brownies.

09:55.696 --> 09:57.128
I probably already ate three.

09:59.833 --> 10:01.032
Everything okay?

10:01.034 --> 10:02.300
Yeah.

10:02.302 --> 10:04.235
Yeah, no, we're just
talkin' work talk.

10:04.237 --> 10:05.237
That's all.

10:06.840 --> 10:08.039
Okay.

10:08.041 --> 10:09.040
You got practice?

10:09.042 --> 10:10.709
Yeah, leaving.

10:10.711 --> 10:11.776
Don't be late.

10:11.778 --> 10:13.378
I won't.

10:16.216 --> 10:17.616
I got to do this.

10:18.652 --> 10:19.652
Okay.

10:21.254 --> 10:22.254
I believe in ya.

10:23.190 --> 10:24.723
Oh, thank you.

10:31.331 --> 10:32.797
That's about it.

10:32.799 --> 10:34.065
Hey, it gives you
an extra suckage.

10:34.067 --> 10:35.700
- What kinda shit?
- Yeah, it gives you suckage.

10:35.702 --> 10:38.069
- You got to combo suck it.
- I heard that about it.

10:38.071 --> 10:40.672
Hey, what ever happened to Nina?

10:40.674 --> 10:41.757
I don't know.

10:41.758 --> 10:42.958
Fell in love or some bullshit.

10:43.710 --> 10:46.077
I don't believe in
that fairy tale shit.

10:46.079 --> 10:47.746
Why you got to be so cynical?

10:50.684 --> 10:52.951
Like, that's why, all right?

10:54.087 --> 10:56.287
How 'bout you tell me
your fairy tales, huh?

10:57.691 --> 10:58.691
I'm waiting.

11:00.093 --> 11:01.093
How 'bout you, Sid?

11:03.263 --> 11:04.429
Yeah, that's what I thought.

11:05.966 --> 11:07.766
That's not fair.

11:07.768 --> 11:10.268
It's all just some facade
that people get trapped in

11:10.270 --> 11:11.936
until the monster shows up.

11:12.973 --> 11:14.706
Hey, you know it.

11:14.708 --> 11:17.876
Maybe not all, but
we're all broken.

11:17.878 --> 11:20.178
And when you put two
broken people together,

11:23.050 --> 11:25.850
eventually they'll start
breaking each other.

11:25.852 --> 11:30.855
Listen to little
Miss Positivity over here.

11:30.857 --> 11:34.392
He was fine, though.

11:34.394 --> 11:36.261
- He was.
- Oh, he was fine.

11:36.263 --> 11:38.863
- Oh.
- Mm, mm.

11:38.865 --> 11:41.933
Does that make it worth it, huh?

11:41.935 --> 11:42.967
Breakin' your heart?

11:44.471 --> 11:45.904
Those looks?

11:45.906 --> 11:47.272
I ain't sayin' all that.

11:47.274 --> 11:51.209
- Sometimes it's worth it.
- All right.

12:02.422 --> 12:04.055
Here ya go, man.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.491
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

12:12.833 --> 12:13.898
Here ya go.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.200
I hope it helps your day.

12:15.202 --> 12:16.868
Thank you, I'm sure it will.

12:21.041 --> 12:23.908
- Why did you do that?
- Do what?

12:23.910 --> 12:26.845
Give money to the
bums and crackheads.

12:26.847 --> 12:28.913
You know, they're probably
just gonna buy booze

12:28.915 --> 12:30.782
or drugs with that later.

12:30.784 --> 12:32.450
I don't really think
about that part.

12:32.452 --> 12:34.119
I mean, he's in need
and I have access,

12:34.121 --> 12:36.187
so why wouldn't I try
and give a little?

12:37.257 --> 12:39.457
If you wanna
fuel his drug addiction,

12:39.459 --> 12:40.792
be my guest.

12:40.794 --> 12:41.493
You don't even know that.

12:41.495 --> 12:42.994
It's so judgmental, May.

12:47.067 --> 12:48.399
You know, let's find out.

12:49.836 --> 12:51.102
Wait, what?

12:51.104 --> 12:52.137
Come here.

12:55.208 --> 12:57.158
Let's watch him.

12:57.159 --> 12:59.109
Okay, you wanna watch a homeless
guy just to prove a point

12:59.112 --> 13:00.478
that he'll just waste the money?

13:00.480 --> 13:01.446
Are you serious?

13:01.448 --> 13:04.883
You're just nervous
because you know I'm right.

13:04.885 --> 13:05.885
No.

13:08.488 --> 13:09.821
You know what?

13:09.823 --> 13:10.855
Fine, let's do it.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.921
Uh, what are you guys doing?

13:45.926 --> 13:48.059
May, what are we doing?

13:49.162 --> 13:50.162
Uh?

13:52.866 --> 13:53.866
Bridget.

13:57.204 --> 13:58.903
Come on, Bridget, please.

14:00.006 --> 14:01.006
What, David?

14:02.309 --> 14:05.877
Back off, let it go, what?

14:05.879 --> 14:08.880
Yes, all of that.

14:11.418 --> 14:13.335
I mean, why can't you?

14:13.336 --> 14:15.496
So a few rich people potentially
live forever, so what?

14:17.557 --> 14:19.257
Isn't one already too many?

14:21.895 --> 14:24.362
If you don't listen,
I can't help you.

14:25.565 --> 14:28.900
Now, do you really think
their rich and powerful people

14:28.902 --> 14:30.301
are gonna let you
steal their Holy Grail

14:30.303 --> 14:32.170
when it's right
there in front them?

14:34.441 --> 14:36.307
Who gets to decide
where it ends?

14:37.577 --> 14:40.945
Who gets to decide whose life
is precious enough to save

14:40.947 --> 14:42.113
and whose isn't?

14:42.115 --> 14:46.251
How can you not see the
repercussions of this, David?

14:47.320 --> 14:48.953
How can you look your
family in the eyes

14:48.955 --> 14:52.323
and tell them that
you stood behind this?

14:52.325 --> 14:55.927
Look, all I'm saying is if you
don't change your position,

14:55.929 --> 14:57.061
I can't protect you.

14:58.231 --> 14:59.597
Are you threatening me?

15:01.935 --> 15:03.468
After all our years
of friendship,

15:03.470 --> 15:06.104
you dare to stand
there and threaten me

15:06.106 --> 15:08.940
because I have the
balls to stand up

15:08.942 --> 15:10.575
for what is morally right?

15:13.213 --> 15:17.415
No, no, I'm saying
I can't protect you!

15:19.219 --> 15:21.386
I swear, Bridget, you
don't even understand

15:21.388 --> 15:22.520
what you're up against.

15:22.522 --> 15:24.489
Maybe I don't.

15:24.491 --> 15:25.523
Maybe I don't.

15:25.525 --> 15:27.191
But I know who I'm
standing up for.

15:27.193 --> 15:28.660
- Oh!
- No, I know what kind of

15:28.662 --> 15:30.695
a world I wanna
leave behind for her.

15:30.697 --> 15:33.164
Her, David, your godchild!

15:39.372 --> 15:40.705
- Bridget.
- Hmm?

15:48.114 --> 15:49.114
Okay.

15:53.153 --> 15:54.153
Okay.

16:04.998 --> 16:06.597
Thank you.

16:09.002 --> 16:11.069
What can I get for this?

16:17.277 --> 16:19.610
- Here ya go.
- Okay, thanks.

16:24.551 --> 16:25.551
Thanks.

16:35.762 --> 16:37.295
Hey, guys.

16:37.297 --> 16:38.229
- Hey, guy.
- Hey, what up?

16:38.231 --> 16:40.164
Got us some grub.

16:44.237 --> 16:46.304
- Bless you.
- Thank you, man.

16:46.306 --> 16:48.139
Bless you, bless you.

16:55.315 --> 16:57.348
I feel like such an idiot.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.050
You should.

16:59.052 --> 17:00.785
That's terrible, you guys.

17:00.786 --> 17:02.519
Okay, that's what everyone says.

17:02.522 --> 17:06.057
If everyone lies the same
lie, it's still a lie.

17:06.059 --> 17:07.258
Yeah, I know, I know.

17:08.127 --> 17:09.527
I just kinda feel bad.

17:12.365 --> 17:14.398
We should do
something nice for him.

17:15.734 --> 17:16.634
Yeah, sure.

17:16.636 --> 17:19.404
I agree, but like what?

17:21.473 --> 17:24.442
I don't know, maybe bake or
cook something really good?

17:26.813 --> 17:29.047
Sure, yeah.

17:29.682 --> 17:31.215
Yeah?

17:31.217 --> 17:32.817
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

17:35.355 --> 17:36.488
Yeah.

17:36.489 --> 17:37.769
David, listen, I
talked with her.

17:39.125 --> 17:41.826
I mean, I tried but she's
not gonna change her mind.

17:43.096 --> 17:44.495
I don't know what
they'll do, Mark.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.365
Fuck, they can't fire her, so.

17:47.367 --> 17:48.566
No, you don't get it.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.701
That's the least of
what I worry about.

17:50.703 --> 17:52.103
What then?

17:52.105 --> 17:53.665
Spread lies and rumors
to discredit her?

17:54.774 --> 17:56.374
No, you don't understand
what we're dealing with here.

17:56.376 --> 17:58.843
These are some of the most
powerful people in the world

17:58.845 --> 18:02.180
and she's about to spoil their
attempt at life everlasting.

18:03.383 --> 18:06.184
I think they'll do
anything to protect that.

18:06.186 --> 18:07.718
And I do mean anything, Mark.

18:08.588 --> 18:09.588
Wow.

18:11.124 --> 18:12.256
Wow, okay.

18:12.258 --> 18:13.458
I'll talk with her.

18:13.460 --> 18:16.160
I'll try again, but
you know Bridget.

18:16.162 --> 18:17.162
Yeah.

18:18.531 --> 18:20.131
Maybe we need protection.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.834
- Security?
- Mm-hmm.

18:22.836 --> 18:25.536
Trust me when I say there's
nowhere you can or hide

18:25.538 --> 18:27.205
that these people can't reach.

18:28.875 --> 18:31.609
I'm here as a friend,
remember that.

18:31.611 --> 18:34.145
But it's outta my hands now.

18:36.416 --> 18:38.416
Thanks for the warning.

18:38.418 --> 18:39.750
Yeah, sorry.

18:41.454 --> 18:44.222
Okay, I'll walk ya out.

18:44.858 --> 18:46.290
All right.

18:54.167 --> 18:55.167
Check.

18:56.836 --> 18:59.904
Hmm, looks like
I'm in trouble now.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.440
Yeah, indeed, yeah.

19:02.442 --> 19:04.775
What are you gonna do about it?

19:11.184 --> 19:12.917
Check and mate.

19:15.855 --> 19:17.421
Good game, Corey.

19:19.492 --> 19:20.791
You gonna do this next week?

19:20.793 --> 19:22.894
Yeah, sure thing.

19:22.896 --> 19:25.196
And next week, I'm gonna win.

19:27.634 --> 19:28.799
You always say that.

19:28.801 --> 19:30.701
Well, you can't blame
a guy for tryin'.

19:33.339 --> 19:34.472
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:35.942 --> 19:38.876
You don't give up
easily, do you?

19:38.878 --> 19:40.378
Should I?

19:40.380 --> 19:45.349
Well, I'm not much of
a talker, remember?

19:45.351 --> 19:47.351
Strong, silent type.

19:47.353 --> 19:49.887
I like it.

19:49.889 --> 19:51.756
I just think he's
a slow starter.

19:55.228 --> 19:56.327
- Stacey?
- Yes?

19:58.498 --> 20:00.264
Don't you have something to do?

20:00.266 --> 20:01.266
Nope.

20:02.502 --> 20:04.702
Think you can
go find something to do?

20:05.772 --> 20:07.438
Why do you even bring me?

20:08.508 --> 20:09.640
Fine, all right.

20:09.642 --> 20:11.375
Bye.

20:11.377 --> 20:12.377
Bye.

20:13.246 --> 20:16.414
So, what do you want?

20:16.416 --> 20:18.849
To get to know you.

20:19.919 --> 20:21.686
You are the first
seemingly decent person

20:21.688 --> 20:23.721
that I have met in a while,

20:23.723 --> 20:24.789
so I'm curious.

20:27.260 --> 20:29.994
How do you know I'm
not just pretending?

20:29.996 --> 20:32.263
That's a good question.

20:32.265 --> 20:33.798
A conman wouldn't
just risk his own life

20:33.800 --> 20:35.499
to protect a street girl

20:36.603 --> 20:39.237
or share his food
with people in need,

20:40.540 --> 20:43.507
play chess with a lonely
old man and lose on purpose.

20:44.944 --> 20:46.544
Who says I lose on purpose?

20:47.814 --> 20:48.814
So coffee?

20:51.417 --> 20:52.417
Yeah.

20:58.758 --> 20:59.991
The target is Bridget.

20:59.993 --> 21:04.562
She is to be taken
alive and unharmed.

21:04.564 --> 21:08.299
Anyone else is nothing
but collateral damage

21:08.301 --> 21:09.667
and is expected.

21:10.570 --> 21:11.570
Security?

21:12.305 --> 21:14.505
As far as we know, nothing,

21:14.507 --> 21:15.806
except her husband.

21:18.978 --> 21:22.346
Okay, give me 'til
the end of the day.

21:22.348 --> 21:23.848
I'll pick up some patterns

21:23.850 --> 21:26.784
and we'll likely
grab her on her way

21:26.786 --> 21:27.985
to or from work tomorrow.

21:27.987 --> 21:29.520
No, absolutely not.

21:29.522 --> 21:32.857
We are not going to
mix work into this.

21:32.859 --> 21:37.028
I'd rather it look like a
kidnapping for ransom or...

21:40.466 --> 21:41.966
Take her in her home.

21:43.536 --> 21:45.069
No, not a good idea.

21:46.339 --> 21:48.005
That's the place with
the most variables

21:48.007 --> 21:49.674
and the most security, mm-mm.

21:50.743 --> 21:54.378
Look, as I explained,
this is urgent

21:54.380 --> 21:56.881
and I need you to do this

21:56.883 --> 21:59.750
without complaining
about the rules.

21:59.752 --> 22:01.419
That's why there's
$5 million in it

22:01.421 --> 22:03.821
for you and your boys, savvy?

22:03.823 --> 22:05.923
In theory, this sounds great.

22:05.925 --> 22:08.626
The problem is what am I
gonna do with $5 million

22:08.628 --> 22:11.829
if I'm dead or in
jail, for that matter?

22:13.900 --> 22:16.067
Guess I chose the wrong crew.

22:16.069 --> 22:17.069
Now, hang on.

22:19.505 --> 22:23.674
10 million, five now, five
upon completion of the mission,

22:23.676 --> 22:25.509
and we'll take her in her home.

22:46.799 --> 22:49.600
Okay, I'll support
you and stand by you

22:49.602 --> 22:51.936
whatever decision you make.

22:51.938 --> 22:54.672
But I am serious, this
is some scary shit.

22:55.842 --> 22:57.375
We're gonna need security.

22:58.077 --> 23:00.678
I think you might be right.

23:00.680 --> 23:02.747
Good, I made a few calls.

23:02.749 --> 23:03.881
They're on their way.

23:04.984 --> 23:06.684
Do you really think that...

23:07.954 --> 23:10.421
Don't you think we might
be just blowing this

23:10.423 --> 23:11.922
completely outta proportion?

23:12.959 --> 23:15.159
I hope you're right.

23:19.565 --> 23:20.664
Where is she going?

23:21.901 --> 23:23.167
I don't know.

23:29.475 --> 23:30.841
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:30.843 --> 23:31.909
Where are you goin'?

23:33.112 --> 23:35.446
Oh, me and May are just
running out up the road.

23:35.448 --> 23:36.981
Okay, well, be back by dark.

23:36.983 --> 23:38.048
All right?

23:39.886 --> 23:41.919
When I came home, I was lost.

23:43.589 --> 23:45.990
I expected to come back
to the love of my life.

23:47.460 --> 23:49.193
Instead, I was handed
divorce papers.

23:52.465 --> 23:56.867
On top of that, I found out
she was engaged to another man.

23:56.869 --> 23:57.869
Wow!

23:58.805 --> 24:00.137
It's her loss.

24:00.139 --> 24:01.705
I didn't have anything left.

24:02.875 --> 24:05.676
No home, no family,

24:07.647 --> 24:09.880
and then I'm expected
to pick up the pieces.

24:11.751 --> 24:12.950
I couldn't even find a job

24:12.952 --> 24:14.819
that would afford
me a place to live.

24:16.823 --> 24:18.823
So I started sleeping
on the streets,

24:20.660 --> 24:22.760
and people look at
you like you're a bum.

24:23.796 --> 24:24.728
I'm not a bum.

24:24.730 --> 24:30.701
I'm a human being and I'm
out there and I'm fighting,

24:30.703 --> 24:33.704
clawing, and scraping
just to survive.

24:34.807 --> 24:38.709
And, then, I just
didn't see the point.

24:40.213 --> 24:42.112
I didn't feel like
fighting anymore.

24:45.818 --> 24:47.151
I just about quit life.

24:54.060 --> 24:56.060
Hey, so we
made some food for you

24:56.062 --> 24:58.095
and anyone else you
wanna share it with.

24:58.097 --> 24:59.730
- You made this?
- Mm-hmm.

25:00.800 --> 25:02.066
- For me?
- Yeah.

25:03.135 --> 25:04.802
I never cooked so
much in my life.

25:10.610 --> 25:12.076
That's really kind.

25:12.078 --> 25:13.978
I also grabbed
some of my savings.

25:13.980 --> 25:16.947
I was gonna buy crap that I
didn't really need anyways.

25:16.949 --> 25:20.150
Hey, I mean thank
you for the food but.

25:23.289 --> 25:24.755
I can't take your money.

25:25.825 --> 25:27.892
I'll just leave
it on the ground.

25:30.229 --> 25:31.896
It'll just go to waste I guess.

25:34.267 --> 25:35.933
What am I supposed to do here?

25:37.003 --> 25:39.036
I think she made
that pretty clear.

25:46.579 --> 25:47.778
How old are you guys?

25:47.780 --> 25:49.780
- I'm 17.
- 16.

25:53.319 --> 25:57.988
What Corey is trying
to say is thank you.

25:57.990 --> 25:59.123
You're welcome.

26:02.728 --> 26:03.728
Hey!

26:05.731 --> 26:06.731
Thank you.

26:07.600 --> 26:09.133
Tell your parents they did good.

26:12.271 --> 26:14.805
I wish there were more
people in the world like you.

26:16.809 --> 26:17.975
It'd be a better place.

26:28.020 --> 26:29.620
No, no, no, no, no.

26:29.622 --> 26:31.088
Don't listen to these rumors.

26:31.090 --> 26:34.692
Goddammit, I am still
managing this project

26:34.694 --> 26:37.795
and I promise you, I
will continue to do so.

26:37.797 --> 26:40.898
All right, I apologize.

26:40.900 --> 26:43.067
But I hear Bridget
wants us to hold off

26:43.069 --> 26:45.936
and stay on the
cadavers until at least

26:45.938 --> 26:48.639
the ethics committee can
clear us to go forward.

26:48.641 --> 26:50.074
Don't you know that
we have a chance

26:50.076 --> 26:52.343
to be trailblazers here?

26:52.345 --> 26:55.179
We can make mortality
a thing of the past.

26:55.181 --> 26:59.383
We can give someone or
anyone everlasting life.

26:59.385 --> 27:00.317
I mean, don't you get it?

27:00.319 --> 27:02.686
It would be immoral not to.

27:02.688 --> 27:06.056
I mean, we must push
forward on this.

27:06.058 --> 27:10.094
Even the best invention
in the wrong hands

27:10.096 --> 27:12.863
can be turned into
a weapon of sorts.

27:13.633 --> 27:15.099
We need to make
sure that we're on

27:15.101 --> 27:16.400
the right side of history.

27:16.402 --> 27:20.671
I agree, but these hands
are the right hands.

27:20.673 --> 27:23.140
If we have to break a few
eggs to make the omelet,

27:24.076 --> 27:25.743
we'll do so.

27:25.745 --> 27:26.745
Exactly.

27:28.347 --> 27:31.115
Sofia, you know,
I believe with all

27:31.117 --> 27:33.684
the stem cell technologies
and the research

27:33.686 --> 27:35.753
and everything they're
doing right now,

27:37.089 --> 27:41.759
trust me, we'll be soon
growing our own bodies.

27:43.996 --> 27:45.529
And nobody,

27:45.530 --> 27:47.063
nobody needs to die
to get a new shell.

27:50.770 --> 27:52.703
I don't know.

27:52.705 --> 27:56.907
Look, even now, the people
we are scheduled to work on

27:57.877 --> 28:01.045
are in all legal
terms brain dead

28:02.148 --> 28:05.015
and the brains are in
terminally ill bodies.

28:05.017 --> 28:06.250
That's the whole thing.

28:06.252 --> 28:09.753
We are giving people
a chance at new life.

28:09.755 --> 28:13.057
Sofia, what if your mother
had a degenerative disease?

28:14.126 --> 28:16.193
Now she has a second chance.

28:16.195 --> 28:18.729
Magnus, the same
thing, you know?

28:18.731 --> 28:20.764
Not only should we
continue to do this,

28:20.766 --> 28:23.167
- we must continue to do this.
- Yes!

28:23.169 --> 28:24.401
- We have to.
- We have to!

28:24.403 --> 28:29.473
Oliver, I would like to
see Bridget's signature

28:30.743 --> 28:32.810
or at least hear her
endorsement on this.

28:32.812 --> 28:35.412
Not a problem, she's on board.

28:35.414 --> 28:38.248
It just takes her a little
more time to process things.

28:49.061 --> 28:49.927
Thank you.

28:49.929 --> 28:51.028
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

28:57.203 --> 28:59.103
- We really needed this.
- Yeah.

29:00.172 --> 29:01.172
Yeah, we did.

29:02.441 --> 29:05.075
God, I cannot wait for
this stress to be done.

29:05.077 --> 29:07.845
Honey, let's try not
to talk about it.

29:07.847 --> 29:12.015
Let's just forget
everything and relax.

29:13.786 --> 29:14.786
You're right.

29:17.056 --> 29:18.922
Do you wanna watch something?

29:18.924 --> 29:20.124
Yeah, sure.

29:22.795 --> 29:23.894
Is Miranda still up?

29:24.930 --> 29:26.330
Oh.

29:26.332 --> 29:27.931
Mira?

29:30.269 --> 29:32.069
Mira!

29:33.973 --> 29:34.973
Mira!

29:39.879 --> 29:41.411
I can't believe we have
to text our own daughter.

29:41.413 --> 29:42.880
When we're at home to get her.

30:20.319 --> 30:21.819
Clear.

30:21.821 --> 30:23.487
- Down on the ground!
- Don't move, on the ground!

30:23.489 --> 30:24.855
- Hands up right now!
- Hands up, hands up!

30:24.857 --> 30:27.391
- Please, sir, please!
- No, shut up!

30:27.393 --> 30:28.592
- Run!
- Go, Miranda!

30:28.594 --> 30:29.860
- Run!
- Go!

30:29.862 --> 30:32.129
- Shut your mouths!
- Go!

30:45.878 --> 30:47.611
Help, help me, help!

30:48.881 --> 30:50.013
- My parents...
- Whoa!

30:50.015 --> 30:51.148
- Or a man that...
- Wait, what happened?

30:51.150 --> 30:53.417
Guards, a man came to my house.

30:53.419 --> 30:54.451
Hey, hey, slow down.

30:54.453 --> 30:56.420
I can't understand you.

30:56.422 --> 30:58.555
Breathe, now, what happened?

31:00.893 --> 31:01.893
They awake yet?

31:03.429 --> 31:04.429
I don't think so.

31:13.973 --> 31:14.905
Yeah.

31:14.907 --> 31:16.907
Yeah, we got the packages.

31:16.909 --> 31:19.243
Good, further
instructions on the way.

31:19.245 --> 31:20.911
All right.

31:21.580 --> 31:22.946
Let's unload 'em.

31:35.327 --> 31:37.594
Hey, what happened here?

31:37.596 --> 31:39.129
Not quite sure yet.

31:39.131 --> 31:40.931
I'm friends with the family.

31:40.933 --> 31:41.933
Are they safe?

31:44.136 --> 31:45.936
You're a friend of the family?

31:45.938 --> 31:48.338
Oh, my clothes?

31:48.340 --> 31:50.674
Sorry, I just got
back from camping.

31:51.944 --> 31:53.477
Mark George is in route to 496.

31:53.479 --> 31:57.347
The family's missing and the
security guards are dead.

31:57.349 --> 32:00.083
Ah, shit, I hope they're okay.

32:01.120 --> 32:03.353
Trust me, if these
guys wanted 'em dead,

32:03.355 --> 32:04.355
they'd be dead.

32:05.624 --> 32:07.958
So the fact they're gone
is the better alternative.

32:07.960 --> 32:11.561
I guess.

32:20.239 --> 32:24.107
Bridget.

32:24.109 --> 32:25.375
Honey, Bridget?

32:28.147 --> 32:29.147
Bridget?

32:31.583 --> 32:33.317
Miranda, where's Miranda?

32:33.319 --> 32:34.718
Miranda?

32:34.720 --> 32:35.720
Shh, shh!

32:37.122 --> 32:38.322
Listen up!

32:38.324 --> 32:40.991
All you have to
do is what we say

32:40.993 --> 32:43.193
when we say it
with no hesitation

32:43.195 --> 32:44.661
and you won't get hurt.

32:44.663 --> 32:46.263
Do you understand?

32:46.265 --> 32:47.698
Yes, but I got to
couple of questions.

32:47.700 --> 32:49.299
Shut up!

32:49.301 --> 32:51.034
We will not engage
with you unless it's

32:51.036 --> 32:55.272
about pissing, eating,
or fucking drinking.

32:55.274 --> 32:56.540
Follow those simple rules,

32:56.542 --> 32:58.041
you might survive this.

32:58.043 --> 32:59.643
Miranda, where is she?

33:00.546 --> 33:02.479
Was I not clear, bitch?

33:04.016 --> 33:04.882
Hey.

33:04.883 --> 33:05.883
Hey, hey!

33:10.422 --> 33:12.222
Hopefully that cleared it up.

33:12.224 --> 33:13.690
Don't fuck with me!

33:27.606 --> 33:29.639
This makes us
operational, correct?

33:30.642 --> 33:33.176
No, not just yet.

33:33.178 --> 33:35.312
You have to give me
another couple of days.

33:35.314 --> 33:36.480
Well, with Nikita's help,

33:36.482 --> 33:38.515
we should be able
to move faster.

33:42.621 --> 33:44.121
Dr. Hermanson.

33:50.462 --> 33:52.496
We're breaking so many
laws right now, Oliver.

33:52.498 --> 33:55.065
- Hmm.
- Are you absolutely certain

33:55.067 --> 33:58.068
- about this?
- Nikita worked on

33:58.070 --> 33:59.503
the original draft.

33:59.505 --> 34:01.805
Then, she went to Intragenetica,

34:01.807 --> 34:03.540
so she knows what she's doin'.

34:04.543 --> 34:05.575
She's an expert.

34:07.379 --> 34:08.779
She could only help.

34:08.781 --> 34:11.481
And I must admit, I am excited.

34:11.483 --> 34:12.649
Hmm.

34:12.650 --> 34:14.751
When will it be
ready for trials?

34:14.753 --> 34:16.753
I'm still awaiting
clearance on human trials,

34:16.755 --> 34:21.091
but we have done primates
very successfully.

34:21.092 --> 34:24.428
All I can say is get
it done, understood?

34:26.697 --> 34:27.697
Fine.

34:38.143 --> 34:39.842
There has to be
something we can do.

34:40.712 --> 34:42.579
I don't know what that would be.

34:43.649 --> 34:45.482
Miranda, these guys
were professionals.

34:46.518 --> 34:48.385
We don't even know who they are.

34:48.387 --> 34:52.121
Yeah, and we really
just need to get you

34:52.123 --> 34:54.190
to family as soon as possible.

34:54.193 --> 34:55.659
I don't really have any family.

34:55.661 --> 34:57.527
I mean, my grandpa's in New York

34:57.529 --> 34:59.229
and my mom's sister's in Miami.

35:00.399 --> 35:04.534
We're not close and I
don't think I'd be safe.

35:04.536 --> 35:07.537
Do you have any idea
what this was about?

35:07.539 --> 35:10.440
Not sure, but it probably
has something to do

35:10.442 --> 35:11.875
with my mom's work.

35:11.877 --> 35:14.811
They've been stressing
over it a lot lately.

35:14.813 --> 35:16.780
What does she do?

35:16.781 --> 35:18.748
She's the CEO of Bio
Engineered Research Ventures.

35:21.553 --> 35:22.819
That sounds oddly familiar.

35:22.821 --> 35:25.822
Yeah, they did the
first head transplant.

35:25.824 --> 35:26.823
They were on to something,

35:26.825 --> 35:29.759
but my mom wasn't on board.

35:30.562 --> 35:32.295
My parents were talking about it

35:32.297 --> 35:34.231
and stressing over it,

35:34.233 --> 35:36.600
so I'm guessing it's
some kind of big deal.

35:36.602 --> 35:38.368
That's wild.

35:39.571 --> 35:41.905
Yeah, I think I remember
hearing about that.

35:45.844 --> 35:48.845
They had some guy with
a degenerative disease

35:48.847 --> 35:51.581
and they put his
head on the body

35:51.583 --> 35:53.683
of some brain-dead dude, right?

35:54.586 --> 35:56.153
Yeah, something like that.

35:57.222 --> 35:58.788
They've been doing
that ever since.

36:00.359 --> 36:03.226
Something else happened
and I don't know what.

36:03.228 --> 36:04.394
That's unbelievable.

36:06.198 --> 36:09.933
When I was in Afghanistan,
I watched people lose legs

36:11.637 --> 36:13.570
and have other
debilitating injuries.

36:15.674 --> 36:18.542
This could give them a
new body and a new life.

36:21.613 --> 36:22.613
Yeah.

36:23.482 --> 36:26.616
But now the richest of the rich

36:26.618 --> 36:28.185
have their Fountain of Youth,

36:29.421 --> 36:31.688
and I'm not so sure
it's good to play God.

36:32.925 --> 36:34.658
I'm sure there are plenty
of people out there

36:34.660 --> 36:36.893
that are willing to
just use this as some

36:37.796 --> 36:39.796
Stephen King's "Pet Sematary"

36:39.798 --> 36:42.632
and that is kinda creepy.

36:42.634 --> 36:46.803
Well, that makes this all
the bit more complicated.

36:46.805 --> 36:48.271
Why is that?

36:48.273 --> 36:50.340
Because they're
likely looking for her

36:51.443 --> 36:52.642
and they don't care
who they take out

36:52.644 --> 36:53.777
to get what they want.

37:00.586 --> 37:03.553
I appreciate your
perspective on this, Clive.

37:03.555 --> 37:04.588
I really do.

37:04.590 --> 37:09.459
Oliver, I understood William's
vision for this company,

37:10.729 --> 37:15.265
for us, better than anyone
except perhaps Bridget.

37:17.336 --> 37:19.269
And I remember
holding her in my arms

37:19.271 --> 37:20.670
the day after she was born.

37:20.672 --> 37:23.673
Well, who's to say what
William would have wanted

37:23.675 --> 37:25.308
in today's world?

37:25.310 --> 37:28.578
We can't speculate on
what William would do.

37:28.580 --> 37:30.247
He'd want what's right.

37:31.817 --> 37:34.417
Well, William and I were close,

37:34.419 --> 37:36.419
but not like you two.

37:36.421 --> 37:41.491
But I did see his vision
and his passion for life.

37:42.294 --> 37:43.827
Excuse me, gentlemen.

37:43.829 --> 37:45.662
Oliver, we need to talk.

37:47.366 --> 37:48.965
I'm sure we're just wrapping up

37:48.967 --> 37:54.037
and seems like it's pretty
urgent so, gentlemen.

37:54.973 --> 37:55.973
Thank you, sir.

38:04.583 --> 38:05.982
I suppose you've heard.

38:05.984 --> 38:07.050
Of course, I did.

38:07.986 --> 38:09.552
Are you out of your mind?

38:10.656 --> 38:13.590
Guns, kidnapping, murder?

38:13.592 --> 38:16.059
I told you I would do it my way

38:16.061 --> 38:18.728
if you failed doing
it your way, right?

38:18.730 --> 38:20.864
Yeah, but I didn't know
that you would go this far.

38:20.866 --> 38:24.601
You didn't think that I
would wait forever, did you?

38:24.603 --> 38:26.403
Two people are dead.

38:26.405 --> 38:27.804
The whole family is missing.

38:29.474 --> 38:30.774
Tell me they're still alive.

38:30.776 --> 38:32.542
Of course, they are.

38:33.812 --> 38:37.881
And I will let them go as soon
as we complete the merger.

38:37.883 --> 38:38.882
Merger?

38:38.884 --> 38:40.050
Bridget has the veto.

38:40.052 --> 38:41.551
She already voted no.

38:41.553 --> 38:44.020
I know, but in her absence,

38:44.022 --> 38:46.623
the board has the
authority to cast her vote

38:46.625 --> 38:48.958
and it's looking like
it will be unanimous.

38:48.960 --> 38:51.761
Yeah, well, Ken'll
never vote yes,

38:51.763 --> 38:53.263
Maggie's not in favor of it,

38:53.264 --> 38:54.764
and Thomas would never
vote against Bridget.

38:54.766 --> 38:56.766
- No way!
- I would not be too sure.

38:56.768 --> 39:00.370
My negotiating skills are
a lot better than that.

39:00.372 --> 39:02.806
Yeah, well, you
couldn't convince Bridget,

39:02.808 --> 39:04.374
now could ya?

39:04.376 --> 39:05.709
She doesn't have a vote.

39:06.912 --> 39:09.979
Frankly, I'm not convinced
I'd vote with ya.

39:23.395 --> 39:24.127
Yes?

39:24.129 --> 39:26.429
Do you have all three packages?

39:26.431 --> 39:29.599
No, I have the two
large packages.

39:30.802 --> 39:33.403
What's the
status on the little one?

39:33.405 --> 39:34.704
I'm not sure.

39:34.706 --> 39:36.940
It must have slipped
through the cracks somehow.

39:36.942 --> 39:37.942
Well, find it.

39:38.944 --> 39:41.144
I thought you said
it didn't matter.

39:41.146 --> 39:42.379
I said find it.

39:43.849 --> 39:45.148
I'll see what I can do.

40:00.098 --> 40:02.632
Well, it looks
better on you anyway.

40:08.707 --> 40:10.640
It's weird to see
myself like this.

40:11.977 --> 40:12.977
I like it.

40:15.580 --> 40:18.181
Be careful, they're after her.

40:18.183 --> 40:19.516
I'm sure of it.

40:20.852 --> 40:22.986
Yeah, we'll lay low,

40:22.988 --> 40:27.457
but you need to be careful.

40:27.459 --> 40:29.025
Yeah, you got it.

40:42.140 --> 40:44.174
Now, don't take
any stupid chances.

40:44.176 --> 40:47.043
She's a kid, she's
gonna turn up.

40:47.045 --> 40:48.178
I checked her family.

40:48.180 --> 40:49.913
She's got two living relatives.

40:49.915 --> 40:51.548
Neither one of them are local.

40:52.617 --> 40:54.951
Yeah, I'll see what I can find.

40:54.953 --> 40:57.887
All right, and I'm gonna
need you to babysit them.

40:59.524 --> 41:01.024
You know I don't do that shit.

41:01.026 --> 41:04.093
Yeah, but we got to
find the girl.

41:05.831 --> 41:06.963
Fine.

41:06.965 --> 41:08.498
All right, we
don't talk to them.

41:08.500 --> 41:10.967
We don't engage with them.

41:10.969 --> 41:13.603
We're here for $7
1/2 million, right?

41:17.542 --> 41:18.542
Money.

41:28.186 --> 41:29.185
- Hi.
- Hi.

41:29.187 --> 41:30.920
I have a 3:45 with Bridget.

41:30.922 --> 41:33.523
You know, she's not in today.

41:33.525 --> 41:34.858
Can I ask what
this is regarding?

41:34.860 --> 41:36.526
Maybe I can redirect.

41:36.528 --> 41:37.927
It's about a charity case.

41:37.929 --> 41:39.929
She wanted to meet about our
Wounded Warriors Program.

41:39.931 --> 41:42.665
Okay, let me see if I can find
somebody else to help you.

41:42.667 --> 41:44.267
Okay, sure.

41:46.271 --> 41:47.604
David?

41:47.606 --> 41:48.671
Yeah, there's a gentleman here,

41:48.673 --> 41:50.673
said he had a 3:45 with Bridget.

41:51.977 --> 41:53.676
Okay, thanks.

41:55.213 --> 41:56.880
Any messages?

41:56.882 --> 41:58.548
Yeah.

41:59.284 --> 42:00.284
Thank you.

42:05.090 --> 42:06.689
- Hello.
- Hi.

42:06.691 --> 42:09.592
Hey, this is not a very
good day around here for us.

42:09.594 --> 42:10.827
Maybe you should come
back another time.

42:10.829 --> 42:12.161
I already met with her

42:12.163 --> 42:13.830
and she was giving her
corporate donation today,

42:13.832 --> 42:17.267
so I'd really like to
have that before I go.

42:17.269 --> 42:18.902
Hey, I don't know if you heard,

42:18.904 --> 42:21.604
but us veterans aren't
doin' so hot out there.

42:21.606 --> 42:22.839
- Could really use the help.
- Yeah, yeah.

42:22.841 --> 42:24.707
Like I said, it's
just not a good day.

42:25.644 --> 42:26.576
Yeah, so.

42:26.578 --> 42:27.710
When is a good day?

42:27.712 --> 42:30.580
I mean, what the
fuck's it gonna take?

42:30.582 --> 42:32.982
I mean, do we have to
start killing ourselves

42:32.984 --> 42:34.117
when we get back from serving?

42:34.119 --> 42:35.885
Do we put up with
the half-assed care

42:35.887 --> 42:37.854
- that takes forever to get to...
- Okay, listen.

42:37.856 --> 42:39.789
Or what about the lack of mental

42:39.790 --> 42:41.723
and emotional support just
to deal with what we've seen!

42:41.726 --> 42:43.126
Ease up.

42:43.128 --> 42:44.327
How much?

42:44.329 --> 42:46.596
How much was she gonna give?

42:46.598 --> 42:51.000
$100,000.

42:51.002 --> 42:52.869
Hmm, hold on.

42:52.871 --> 42:56.739
Oh, and, yeah, she said
she'd dedicate your work

42:56.741 --> 42:58.207
to severely injured veterans.

43:01.146 --> 43:02.146
Now, who are you?

43:04.749 --> 43:09.819
I am a veteran with the
Wounded Warriors Project, sir.

43:10.088 --> 43:11.287
Uh-huh.

43:13.224 --> 43:15.091
All right, come with me.

43:15.093 --> 43:17.794
Now, who are you exactly?

43:17.796 --> 43:19.713
I'm a veteran.

43:19.714 --> 43:21.631
I'm here with on behalf of
the Wounded Warriors Project.

43:21.633 --> 43:22.765
No, no.

43:22.767 --> 43:23.666
Yeah, I don't think so.

43:23.668 --> 43:25.168
'Cause if that was the case,

43:25.170 --> 43:27.637
you would have the
press here with you

43:27.639 --> 43:30.039
and it would be a
calendar event for us here

43:30.041 --> 43:33.176
and it would be on my schedule,

43:33.178 --> 43:34.777
which it is not.

43:35.914 --> 43:37.113
So, again,

43:38.817 --> 43:40.216
who the hell are you?

43:40.218 --> 43:42.318
Just a concerned friend
who stopped by her house.

43:42.320 --> 43:43.653
A friend?

43:43.655 --> 43:45.922
Oh, good, I should
know you then.

43:45.924 --> 43:48.858
Because, you see, Bridget
and I have known each other

43:48.860 --> 43:51.194
for over 40 years.

43:51.196 --> 43:53.329
I don't remember seeing you
at any family functions,

43:53.331 --> 43:55.932
so how close would
you say you two are?

43:55.934 --> 43:57.734
Not really for a long time.

43:58.670 --> 44:01.337
David, I'm gonna level with you.

44:01.339 --> 44:02.839
Level with me?

44:02.841 --> 44:04.707
Now? Okay.

44:04.709 --> 44:06.943
You see, Bridget
was actually looking

44:06.945 --> 44:09.979
to hire me as security.

44:09.981 --> 44:14.951
Now, why would Bridget
suddenly need security?

44:14.953 --> 44:18.087
If you two were so close,
I'm sure you'd know.

44:18.089 --> 44:21.424
I don't know what you're up
to or who you really are,

44:21.426 --> 44:22.959
- but maybe security can help...
- David, David!

44:22.961 --> 44:24.961
- Me get some clarity on that.
- Let me.

44:36.841 --> 44:37.707
Shit.

44:37.709 --> 44:38.709
Get him!

44:41.146 --> 44:42.245
Whoa!

44:51.056 --> 44:52.255
- Guard?
- Shh.

44:52.257 --> 44:53.723
- No.
- Be quiet, be quiet.

44:53.725 --> 44:54.991
- Guard, please!
- Hey, what are you doin'?

44:54.993 --> 44:55.992
I have to use,

44:55.994 --> 44:57.927
I have to use the washroom!

44:59.464 --> 45:00.463
I got to go.

45:00.465 --> 45:02.398
All right, all right.

45:02.400 --> 45:03.400
I hear ya.

45:08.873 --> 45:09.873
You first.

45:11.176 --> 45:12.875
All right, come on, get up.

45:12.877 --> 45:14.877
Up, up, up, up, up.

45:14.879 --> 45:16.913
- Don't try anything funny.
- Be nice.

45:16.915 --> 45:17.980
Shut up!

45:40.305 --> 45:41.305
Piss.

45:44.776 --> 45:46.776
Not now, I can't.

45:46.778 --> 45:49.846
I can't with you
just standing there.

45:49.848 --> 45:51.514
So you don't have to pee?

45:51.516 --> 45:56.385
No, I do, but can you just.

45:56.387 --> 45:59.188
Do you have to piss or not?

45:59.190 --> 46:01.524
I don't have the patience
for this bullshit.

46:20.078 --> 46:21.078
Done?

46:32.357 --> 46:34.090
Oh, you think I enjoy this?

46:35.160 --> 46:37.226
Don't flatter yourself, bitch.

46:37.228 --> 46:38.228
Up.

46:52.310 --> 46:53.310
I got it.

46:57.515 --> 46:59.549
Hi, Detective Sharpe.

46:59.551 --> 47:02.285
I just need to ask you and
your parents some questions.

47:02.287 --> 47:03.286
Honey who is it?

47:03.288 --> 47:06.289
It's a cop or a detective.

47:06.291 --> 47:07.291
Sorry.

47:09.127 --> 47:11.094
Hi, Mom.

47:11.095 --> 47:13.062
I just have to ask you a
couple questions is all.

47:14.132 --> 47:15.932
Sure, can I get you
something to drink?

47:15.934 --> 47:17.266
No, thanks, I'm good.

47:17.268 --> 47:18.868
I just have to ask you,

47:18.870 --> 47:22.171
do you know anything about
the Pellegrini kidnapping?

47:22.173 --> 47:24.607
Just what we've heard
on the news, I'm afraid.

47:24.609 --> 47:27.410
Hmm, well, we've
been informed that,

47:27.412 --> 47:30.079
likely, the young
daughter, Miranda,

47:30.081 --> 47:32.882
has escaped and may be
hiding with some friends

47:32.884 --> 47:35.051
and these men are after her.

47:35.053 --> 47:36.152
We haven't seen her.

47:36.154 --> 47:37.553
Right, May?

47:37.555 --> 47:39.088
No.

47:39.090 --> 47:40.090
No?

47:41.192 --> 47:43.025
Well, it's urgent
that we do find her

47:43.027 --> 47:44.594
before these kidnappers do,

47:44.596 --> 47:46.996
as they are armed and dangerous.

47:48.099 --> 47:49.498
No idea where she could be?

47:50.435 --> 47:53.603
No, I mean, if she escaped,

47:53.605 --> 47:56.239
she'd probably be
here and she's not.

47:57.308 --> 47:59.609
Well, sorry for the bother.

47:59.611 --> 48:00.576
Thank you.

48:00.578 --> 48:02.378
I'll be seeing myself out.

48:02.379 --> 48:04.179
Do you have a card with
a number we can call

48:04.182 --> 48:05.915
in case we hear something?

48:08.586 --> 48:11.654
You know, I think I mighta
left 'em in my other coat.

48:12.590 --> 48:14.457
But I can get back to you, okay?

48:14.459 --> 48:16.259
That's okay.

48:16.260 --> 48:18.060
What's your extension
and your name, again?

48:19.631 --> 48:24.367
It's Officer Sharpe,
extension 146.

48:24.369 --> 48:26.469
Detective Sharpe.

48:26.471 --> 48:28.137
Detective Sharpe, yes.

48:30.275 --> 48:32.008
Extension 146.

48:33.611 --> 48:37.246
Jesus, you
could ring the doorbell.

48:37.248 --> 48:38.248
Sorry.

48:42.954 --> 48:47.623
So?

48:47.625 --> 48:49.625
Do you know David
at your mom's work?

48:49.627 --> 48:51.227
Yeah, why?

48:51.229 --> 48:52.628
Is he close with your mom?

48:53.631 --> 48:55.031
Yeah.

48:55.033 --> 48:56.632
Would you trust him?

48:56.634 --> 49:00.569
I mean, as much as I trust
anyone right now, I guess.

49:00.571 --> 49:01.971
But they go back?

49:01.973 --> 49:04.240
I doubt he'd do any
harm to any of us.

49:04.242 --> 49:07.710
He pretty much comes to any
of the family functions.

49:07.712 --> 49:11.380
Okay, well, I'm headed back out,

49:11.382 --> 49:13.049
but a few things before I go.

49:18.389 --> 49:20.122
You ever use one?

49:20.124 --> 49:22.692
Yeah, my ex brought
me to the range.

49:22.694 --> 49:25.261
Good, show her how to use it.

49:31.302 --> 49:32.735
Where are you going?

49:32.737 --> 49:34.337
To see if David's our guy.

49:40.611 --> 49:43.012
Easy, nothing stupid.

49:45.416 --> 49:47.316
I shoulda known
you were involved.

49:47.318 --> 49:48.551
Involved with what?

49:48.553 --> 49:49.685
With Oliver.

49:49.687 --> 49:52.221
Are they okay?

49:53.291 --> 49:54.690
Please, at least tell
me they're still alive.

49:54.692 --> 49:56.709
No, you got it all wrong.

49:56.710 --> 49:58.727
I'm not the guy you need
to be concerned with.

49:58.730 --> 50:01.163
Miranda said I can trust you.

50:01.165 --> 50:02.498
So I'm giving that a try.

50:03.334 --> 50:04.734
She said that?

50:04.736 --> 50:05.736
Yeah.

50:07.071 --> 50:10.706
I couldn't stop Oliver;

50:10.708 --> 50:14.443
The merger, whatever
plans they have out.

50:14.445 --> 50:16.512
I know very little
about this situation.

50:16.514 --> 50:19.448
But if I'm gonna help, I
need to know what you know.

50:19.450 --> 50:20.450
Do you mind?

50:21.319 --> 50:23.386
It's a long story but...

50:25.256 --> 50:27.456
Okay, we're the lead
research company

50:27.458 --> 50:31.627
in the transplanting
of human heads

50:31.629 --> 50:34.730
and we did a prototype
with Intragenetica;

50:34.732 --> 50:36.332
Essentially,
downloading the brain

50:36.334 --> 50:40.069
and then planting data in
another host brain and body.

50:41.606 --> 50:45.775
Well, we found out that,
after some successful trials,

50:45.777 --> 50:47.343
they were keeping a
waiting list of people

50:47.345 --> 50:50.079
and they weren't
exactly people in need,

50:50.081 --> 50:51.280
if you know what I mean.

50:54.152 --> 50:56.552
They weren't waiting for bodies
with nonfunctioning brains.

50:56.554 --> 50:58.220
They were actually ordering

50:58.222 --> 51:01.090
their new perfect
bodies and faces and...

51:01.092 --> 51:02.625
- Bridget said no.
- Yeah.

51:02.627 --> 51:06.362
Yeah, Bridget's
always done everything

51:06.364 --> 51:08.264
for all the right reasons.

51:08.266 --> 51:09.765
She learned that
from her father.

51:09.767 --> 51:14.170
So, yeah, yeah, she used
her veto to stop the merger

51:14.172 --> 51:15.104
and it slowed 'em down,

51:15.106 --> 51:18.307
but I believe she was,

51:19.777 --> 51:21.644
she was considering
exposing them.

51:21.646 --> 51:23.245
Now, I tried to talk
some sense into her,

51:23.247 --> 51:24.814
but she's just so...

51:24.816 --> 51:26.449
- Honorable.
- Yeah.

51:27.518 --> 51:29.251
Yeah, I was gonna
say stubborn but...

51:30.421 --> 51:32.254
Okay, look, I better get that.

51:32.256 --> 51:33.122
Hide back there.

51:33.124 --> 51:34.390
Okay, nothin' stupid.

51:34.392 --> 51:35.858
Tell 'em what they wanna hear.

51:41.265 --> 51:42.665
I hope I'm not interrupting.

51:42.667 --> 51:46.268
No, I was about to have
a nightcap and go to bed.

51:46.270 --> 51:47.670
I thought I should drop by

51:47.672 --> 51:49.672
and see if everything's
all right with you.

51:49.674 --> 51:52.141
- Anybody else here?
- No.

51:52.143 --> 51:53.442
No, it's just me.

51:53.444 --> 51:55.411
- Why?
- Just curious.

51:55.413 --> 51:57.480
So, how are you voting?

51:58.349 --> 51:59.381
You know, it's tomorrow.

52:00.551 --> 52:03.686
It just seemed you
were a bit unsure.

52:03.688 --> 52:05.888
Well, no, no, I was
just frustrated.

52:05.890 --> 52:07.890
- Frustrated?
- Yeah, I was frustrated

52:07.892 --> 52:09.725
and I shouldn't and I'm sorry.

52:09.727 --> 52:11.894
Look, I really shouldn't of.

52:11.896 --> 52:12.896
I apologize.

52:13.865 --> 52:17.199
I apologize and I will vote yes.

52:17.201 --> 52:18.467
You're going to vote yes?

52:18.469 --> 52:19.835
Of course.

52:19.837 --> 52:21.704
That's good.

52:21.706 --> 52:24.273
That's very good

52:24.274 --> 52:26.841
because I would hate to
lose another executive.

52:26.844 --> 52:30.779
I'd have to do all of
your work, as well.

52:31.649 --> 52:33.649
It's a nice place you have here.

52:34.719 --> 52:36.452
You should have
me over sometime.

52:36.454 --> 52:39.388
Maybe for a nightcap
or something.

52:40.791 --> 52:41.857
It's just an idea.

52:43.361 --> 52:44.361
Good night to ya.

52:45.863 --> 52:46.863
Shh!

53:05.883 --> 53:08.951
Hey, is somebody out there?

53:08.953 --> 53:09.953
Help!

53:11.222 --> 53:12.421
What I need to do

53:12.423 --> 53:14.890
- is to shut the fuck up!
- I need water.

53:14.892 --> 53:16.358
Hey!

53:16.360 --> 53:17.927
Hey, get down!

53:17.929 --> 53:19.628
- Get the fuck down now!
- All right.

53:19.630 --> 53:21.280
Fuckin' sit down now.

53:21.281 --> 53:22.931
Do you want me to fucking put
a bullet through her head?

53:22.934 --> 53:24.217
Do you want me to
fucking shoot her?

53:24.218 --> 53:25.501
- I'll fucking shoot her!
- Please, don't hurt us.

53:25.503 --> 53:26.502
All right, please,
don't hurt us.

53:26.504 --> 53:27.803
- Please.
- Shut up, fuck!

53:29.440 --> 53:32.441
I am so sick and
tired of babysitting

53:32.443 --> 53:33.642
you two little fucks.

53:33.644 --> 53:35.711
I need you to shut the fuck up.

53:35.713 --> 53:36.912
We're just so thirsty.

53:36.914 --> 53:38.647
Please, you said you'd
give us food and water,

53:38.649 --> 53:40.516
and we haven't
gotten anything yet.

53:40.518 --> 53:42.284
Well, it's not here yet, bitch,

53:42.286 --> 53:44.620
so what the fuck do you
want me to do about it?

53:46.457 --> 53:48.757
Shut up or I will
fucking shoot her.

53:50.661 --> 53:51.661
Fuck!

53:58.302 --> 53:59.335
Fuck!

54:16.287 --> 54:18.754
<i>Mamacita,</i>.

54:18.756 --> 54:20.823
Hey, where's the fuckin' food?

54:20.825 --> 54:23.325
I must stay here a couple
more days and watch things.

54:23.327 --> 54:25.761
Dude, I'm about to lose
it on these two fucks!

54:27.632 --> 54:28.632
Hey!

54:36.574 --> 54:37.439
- Hey.
- Yeah?

54:37.441 --> 54:38.741
I need the food.

54:38.742 --> 54:40.042
These fucking people
won't shut the fuck up

54:40.044 --> 54:42.378
and I need to feed them so
they can shut the fuck up.

54:43.981 --> 54:44.981
Fuck.

54:46.384 --> 54:47.384
Fuck!

55:06.871 --> 55:08.604
Dammit, Oliver, you scared me.

55:08.606 --> 55:10.806
These are scary times.

55:10.808 --> 55:12.308
What are you doing here?

55:12.943 --> 55:14.343
What the hell?

55:15.413 --> 55:19.615
My associate, he's
a bit eccentric,

55:19.617 --> 55:20.683
wouldn't you say?

55:20.685 --> 55:23.952
Now, Mr. Pomeroy, where were we?

55:23.954 --> 55:27.423
Oh, yes, that's right,
the vote tomorrow.

55:28.626 --> 55:29.825
What about it?

55:29.827 --> 55:32.928
Well, you haven't
seem to be in favor,

55:32.930 --> 55:36.031
so I thought I'd have
one last opportunity

55:36.033 --> 55:38.367
to convince you otherwise.

55:38.369 --> 55:41.637
You will not get a
unanimous vote, Oliver.

55:41.639 --> 55:43.672
I'm sure there
are others like me

55:43.674 --> 55:45.774
that morally can't do this,

55:45.776 --> 55:48.777
not to mention Bridget
would never go for this.

55:48.779 --> 55:50.512
Don't be so sure.

55:50.514 --> 55:53.048
I've visited every one of
you old dinosaurs tonight

55:53.050 --> 55:55.584
and you're the last
one left to convince.

55:55.586 --> 55:57.086
- Dinosaurs?
- Dinosaurs.

55:57.088 --> 55:59.121
I'm sorry, you're
wasting your time.

56:01.859 --> 56:02.859
Listen.

56:03.828 --> 56:04.927
I don't know and, honestly,

56:04.929 --> 56:07.062
I don't care what
you do with me.

56:07.064 --> 56:09.598
You will not get my vote.

56:10.835 --> 56:14.536
I was here when William started
this company and I know...

56:15.706 --> 56:18.741
What the fuck did you do?

56:18.743 --> 56:21.543
- Fuck him.
- Yeah, but,

56:21.545 --> 56:23.612
Jesus Christ, there
are cameras everywhere.

56:23.614 --> 56:25.114
Oh, yeah, there are.

56:25.116 --> 56:26.548
Hmm, yeah.

56:26.550 --> 56:27.883
They have your face, Oliver.

56:27.885 --> 56:29.551
Well, let's get outta here.

56:31.455 --> 56:32.455
Come on.

57:08.993 --> 57:10.793
- Hello?
- Hey.

57:10.795 --> 57:12.194
Hey, it's me.

57:12.196 --> 57:13.196
Wait.

57:14.999 --> 57:16.932
Are you okay?

57:16.934 --> 57:18.467
Yeah, I'm okay.

57:18.469 --> 57:20.869
But, hey, don't tell
anyone that I called you.

57:20.871 --> 57:24.740
There was a guy here earlier.

57:24.742 --> 57:26.325
He was looking for you.

57:26.326 --> 57:27.909
He had a badge and said
he was a detective,

57:27.912 --> 57:30.546
but I'm not so sure.

57:31.882 --> 57:33.148
I don't know who we can trust.

57:33.150 --> 57:36.151
Okay, where are you?

57:36.153 --> 57:38.754
Remember Corey,
the homeless guy?

57:38.756 --> 57:39.756
Of course.

57:40.624 --> 57:42.791
I figured no one would know

57:42.793 --> 57:45.027
and I wouldn't
risk anyone's life.

57:45.029 --> 57:46.628
They killed our security

57:46.630 --> 57:49.031
and I don't know what
happened to my mom and dad.

57:49.033 --> 57:49.965
I'm sorry.

57:49.967 --> 57:55.504
Yeah, some kinda special
forces or something.

57:55.506 --> 57:57.639
Well, I guess that's
needed right now.

57:57.641 --> 57:58.707
- Right?
- Yeah.

57:58.709 --> 58:03.011
And his girlfriend or
something, I guess.

58:03.948 --> 58:05.647
Where are you, Mira?

58:05.649 --> 58:07.049
I don't think it's safe to tell.

58:07.051 --> 58:09.184
But don't worry, I'm safe.

58:09.186 --> 58:11.520
And I should probably hang
my phone up right now.

58:11.522 --> 58:14.923
But, seriously,
don't tell anyone.

58:16.227 --> 58:17.493
Not even your mom.

58:18.262 --> 58:20.529
Okay, I promise.

58:20.531 --> 58:21.531
Be safe.

58:23.100 --> 58:24.100
You, too.

58:39.083 --> 58:40.148
Holy Grail.

59:14.251 --> 59:16.184
- Yes?
- Is it ready?

59:16.186 --> 59:17.186
Oh, yeah.

59:24.128 --> 59:27.129
We got to find a way of
breaking outta here.

59:27.131 --> 59:28.491
Maybe we should
just ride this out.

59:32.903 --> 59:35.137
Do you think they're
gonna let us go?

59:38.008 --> 59:39.341
They're wearing masks.

59:40.878 --> 59:42.678
They let you go to the bathroom.

59:44.014 --> 59:45.747
Hell if I know.

59:45.749 --> 59:50.352
No, this has everything
to do with the merger.

59:50.354 --> 59:53.021
- It has to, right?
- Yes.

59:53.023 --> 59:56.291
Right, so why would
they let me to go

59:56.293 --> 59:58.226
so that I could blow
up everything they did

59:58.228 --> 59:59.962
while they held us hostage?

01:00:03.067 --> 01:00:05.033
Yeah, ya got a good point.

01:00:05.035 --> 01:00:06.902
So, how?

01:00:08.038 --> 01:00:09.638
What's your plan?

01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:10.973
We got to figure it out.

01:00:12.042 --> 01:00:13.709
Well, we got to get these off.

01:00:16.647 --> 01:00:17.647
Fuck.

01:00:22.853 --> 01:00:23.853
All right.

01:00:27.391 --> 01:00:28.391
Ow, okay.

01:00:30.194 --> 01:00:31.194
Got it.

01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:45.874
No sudden moves or I empty
this gun in your back.

01:00:47.945 --> 01:00:49.745
What do you want?

01:00:49.747 --> 01:00:52.014
Shh, keep your hands
on the steering wheel.

01:00:53.684 --> 01:00:55.217
Don't try me.

01:00:55.219 --> 01:00:57.219
It won't end well for you.

01:00:57.221 --> 01:00:59.087
What do you want?

01:00:59.089 --> 01:01:00.089
Information.

01:01:01.091 --> 01:01:02.090
What?

01:01:02.092 --> 01:01:03.692
Where is Bridget
and her husband?

01:01:03.694 --> 01:01:04.960
Who?

01:01:04.962 --> 01:01:07.295
Play stupid games,
win stupid prizes.

01:01:08.866 --> 01:01:10.165
Now let's go for a drive.

01:03:07.818 --> 01:03:10.085
Hi.

01:03:10.087 --> 01:03:11.353
You lookin' for somebody?

01:03:11.355 --> 01:03:12.888
No, no.

01:03:15.959 --> 01:03:20.262
I thought I left my phone
around here somewhere.

01:03:20.264 --> 01:03:22.964
Let's just stop
playing games, okay?

01:03:22.966 --> 01:03:24.032
What do you mean?

01:03:24.034 --> 01:03:26.034
You're looking for Miranda.

01:03:26.036 --> 01:03:28.970
No, no, no, no, I was just...

01:03:32.242 --> 01:03:34.910
That was me being nice.

01:03:34.912 --> 01:03:36.044
Hand over your phone.

01:03:37.981 --> 01:03:39.815
I won't ask twice.

01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:48.123
What's your passcode?

01:03:48.125 --> 01:03:49.125
There isn't one.

01:03:51.261 --> 01:03:53.862
Let's see if we have any
unsaved numbers here.

01:03:54.865 --> 01:03:58.066
Look at that.

01:03:59.069 --> 01:04:00.069
Come with me.

01:04:24.494 --> 01:04:25.861
You're on my time.

01:04:29.933 --> 01:04:30.933
Okay.

01:04:33.237 --> 01:04:35.904
We're gonna find out how
badly you wanna live.

01:04:39.042 --> 01:04:41.443
There are other people involved.

01:04:43.046 --> 01:04:45.180
Even if I wanted to help you,

01:04:47.918 --> 01:04:50.452
you'd be fucked.

01:04:50.453 --> 01:04:52.987
This thing is way bigger
than either you or I.

01:04:54.057 --> 01:04:55.390
I don't worry about
the odds too much.

01:04:55.392 --> 01:04:56.658
That makes me dangerous.

01:04:57.995 --> 01:05:00.095
And the fact that I
am trained and skilled

01:05:00.097 --> 01:05:03.531
beyond any of you fuck
boys is another advantage.

01:05:03.533 --> 01:05:07.903
Not to mention, you
don't even know I exist.

01:05:08.672 --> 01:05:10.405
- Oliver.
- What?

01:05:12.542 --> 01:05:16.111
Oliver, he is the
guy behind it all.

01:05:16.113 --> 01:05:17.479
He's the guy with the plan.

01:05:17.481 --> 01:05:19.014
He's the guy with the money.

01:05:20.083 --> 01:05:21.416
- Oliver, huh?
- Yeah.

01:05:24.621 --> 01:05:28.523
So, are you saying I
don't need you anymore?

01:05:28.525 --> 01:05:30.492
No, no, no, no, no.

01:05:30.494 --> 01:05:31.559
That is, no.

01:05:31.561 --> 01:05:35.030
Who is gonna get you in
and out of everything?

01:05:36.366 --> 01:05:39.968
Who is gonna lead you to the
hostages if anything happens?

01:05:41.238 --> 01:05:43.705
Listen, man, you need
me and you know you do.

01:05:55.152 --> 01:05:56.335
Guard, guard!

01:05:56.336 --> 01:05:57.519
Guard, he needs his
insulin, please!

01:05:57.521 --> 01:05:59.254
Hurry!

01:05:59.256 --> 01:06:00.256
Fuck!

01:06:01.325 --> 01:06:02.657
What is it?

01:06:05.562 --> 01:06:07.295
- Shoot her!
- It's not working!

01:06:12.269 --> 01:06:13.269
Fuck.

01:06:16.573 --> 01:06:17.672
Oh, my God, come on.

01:06:17.674 --> 01:06:18.674
Come on.

01:06:23.046 --> 01:06:24.179
Let's go.

01:06:24.181 --> 01:06:26.614
- Come on.
- We have to get out.

01:06:35.559 --> 01:06:37.425
I told you not to call.

01:06:37.427 --> 01:06:39.227
Well, hello, there.

01:06:40.564 --> 01:06:42.097
Who's this?

01:06:42.099 --> 01:06:43.164
A friend of a friend.

01:06:44.234 --> 01:06:45.166
May's here, too.

01:06:45.168 --> 01:06:46.568
Say hello, May.

01:06:47.437 --> 01:06:49.604
May, are you okay?

01:06:49.606 --> 01:06:51.573
As long as you play along,

01:06:51.575 --> 01:06:54.175
she's got nothing
to worry about.

01:06:54.177 --> 01:06:55.177
Where are you?

01:06:56.313 --> 01:06:57.512
I'm not sure.

01:06:57.514 --> 01:07:00.115
Well, you better
figure that out fast.

01:07:00.117 --> 01:07:01.516
I don't know how.

01:07:01.518 --> 01:07:04.352
Well, if you want your
friend to be okay,

01:07:04.354 --> 01:07:07.355
you better start
figuring that out pronto.

01:07:07.357 --> 01:07:09.124
I don't know how.

01:07:10.093 --> 01:07:11.126
Are you inside?

01:07:12.062 --> 01:07:13.328
Yes.

01:07:13.330 --> 01:07:15.597
Okay, go to a
window, look outside.

01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:18.199
It's them, they have May.

01:07:18.201 --> 01:07:19.534
Hey!

01:07:19.536 --> 01:07:21.202
None of that shit.

01:07:21.204 --> 01:07:22.070
What?

01:07:22.072 --> 01:07:24.072
Don't think I'm stupid.

01:07:24.074 --> 01:07:25.473
Do you want to see
your friend hurt?

01:07:25.475 --> 01:07:26.474
Don't touch her.

01:07:26.476 --> 01:07:31.179
Okay, then, you're gonna
listen to everything I say.

01:07:33.617 --> 01:07:36.151
I see a street and cars parked.

01:07:36.153 --> 01:07:39.120
Okay, do you see
any street signs?

01:07:39.122 --> 01:07:40.122
Not from here.

01:07:41.224 --> 01:07:42.224
Are you alone?

01:07:44.795 --> 01:07:45.795
Yes.

01:07:47.130 --> 01:07:48.430
Right now, yes.

01:07:48.432 --> 01:07:52.500
Okay, get out there
as fast as you can.

01:07:52.502 --> 01:07:55.303
Once you get to a
street, call me.

01:07:56.540 --> 01:08:01.309
And, Miranda, your friend's
life is in your hands.

01:08:01.845 --> 01:08:03.711
Do you understand me?

01:08:03.713 --> 01:08:06.214
I understand, I'll hurry.

01:08:07.384 --> 01:08:08.384
Good.

01:08:11.788 --> 01:08:13.354
I'll get you somewhere safe.

01:08:27.170 --> 01:08:29.871
Nobody home.

01:08:29.872 --> 01:08:30.872
So now what?

01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:33.675
Where are they being held?

01:08:34.711 --> 01:08:35.844
Come on.

01:08:35.845 --> 01:08:38.279
I know you're not too bright.

01:08:38.281 --> 01:08:39.613
I didn't know you were deaf.

01:08:42.486 --> 01:08:44.352
A warehouse just
outside of town.

01:08:45.689 --> 01:08:46.689
And how many men?

01:08:49.559 --> 01:08:50.559
Two.

01:08:52.295 --> 01:08:53.295
Show the way.

01:09:29.899 --> 01:09:31.166
You ready?

01:09:31.868 --> 01:09:32.868
Almost.

01:09:34.203 --> 01:09:35.203
Good.

01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:39.439
You've done well, Nikita.

01:09:40.676 --> 01:09:42.277
Thank you, sir.

01:10:01.364 --> 01:10:02.830
I have to admit,

01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:07.769
I am eager.

01:10:16.646 --> 01:10:17.646
Look.

01:10:20.250 --> 01:10:22.717
Behold, the Fountain of Youth.

01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:31.659
Fuck.

01:10:39.402 --> 01:10:40.268
Who are you?

01:10:40.270 --> 01:10:41.270
Drop your weapon.

01:10:42.672 --> 01:10:44.472
I'm Detective Sharpe with
the police department.

01:10:44.474 --> 01:10:45.890
We got a call.

01:10:45.891 --> 01:10:47.307
If you don't drop that
weapon, I will kill you.

01:10:47.310 --> 01:10:49.277
Show me your badge.

01:10:49.279 --> 01:10:51.346
Right there, see, see that?

01:10:51.348 --> 01:10:52.413
I don't believe you!

01:10:52.415 --> 01:10:53.548
I'm here to help,

01:10:53.549 --> 01:10:54.682
but if you don't
drop that weapon,

01:10:54.684 --> 01:10:55.683
I will kill you.

01:10:55.685 --> 01:10:57.018
He's with the cops, okay?

01:10:57.020 --> 01:10:57.986
- No, please.
- Bridget.

01:10:57.988 --> 01:10:59.454
Please, we were kidnapped.

01:10:59.456 --> 01:11:01.489
We just got out;
We were in there.

01:11:02.859 --> 01:11:04.642
There's somebody in there.

01:11:04.643 --> 01:11:06.426
I shot her; It was
self-defense, I promise.

01:11:06.429 --> 01:11:07.629
- I promise it was.
- Bridget!

01:11:07.631 --> 01:11:09.597
- It was, someone in there?
- Yes.

01:11:09.599 --> 01:11:11.432
But, Mark...

01:11:11.434 --> 01:11:12.500
No, ah!

01:11:12.502 --> 01:11:14.969
Mark!

01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:25.947
Please, please don't do this.

01:11:27.484 --> 01:11:30.451
If you ever want to see
your daughter again,

01:11:30.453 --> 01:11:31.786
shut your mouth.

01:11:36.593 --> 01:11:37.593
Help me!

01:11:39.329 --> 01:11:40.662
Please, someone!

01:11:50.507 --> 01:11:52.307
Okay, guys.

01:11:54.377 --> 01:11:55.677
Do we all know what to do?

01:11:58.014 --> 01:12:00.848
I don't like it but, yeah, yeah.

01:12:01.651 --> 01:12:02.651
Oh, Sidney.

01:12:04.621 --> 01:12:06.921
You don't have to do this.

01:12:06.923 --> 01:12:08.356
You know, you can leave.

01:12:09.426 --> 01:12:11.092
I would love your help,

01:12:11.895 --> 01:12:13.895
but I know it's dangerous

01:12:13.897 --> 01:12:18.099
and I totally understand
if you walked.

01:12:19.536 --> 01:12:22.637
Naw, I mean, I'd hate myself
if I did that, ya know?

01:12:23.907 --> 01:12:25.573
Besides, I've never really
done anything heroic,

01:12:25.575 --> 01:12:28.509
so I think it'll make me
feel a little bit better.

01:12:28.511 --> 01:12:32.914
Stacey, are you sure?

01:12:32.916 --> 01:12:33.981
Of course, Steph.

01:12:42.826 --> 01:12:45.660
This all depends on you.

01:12:45.662 --> 01:12:47.862
You have to get
him out of the car.

01:12:49.065 --> 01:12:51.666
If you can't do that,
then we're all screwed.

01:12:53.536 --> 01:12:56.003
Yeah, I know.

01:13:00.143 --> 01:13:01.943
We got this, all right?

01:13:03.947 --> 01:13:05.880
- Yeah.
- Let's do this.

01:13:15.558 --> 01:13:17.091
Come, come, come, come, come.

01:13:26.035 --> 01:13:28.503
First, show
me that they're okay.

01:13:29.839 --> 01:13:33.441
You want me to make an
example outta her, huh?

01:13:33.443 --> 01:13:34.443
Go!

01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:38.446
What the fuck?

01:13:38.448 --> 01:13:39.614
Fuck! Fuck!

01:13:39.616 --> 01:13:40.616
Oh, my God!

01:13:42.152 --> 01:13:43.918
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, my God, fuck!

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:45.119
I'm sorry, Sidney.

01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:47.722
Sidney, don't you quit.

01:13:47.724 --> 01:13:49.457
Don't you quit on me!

01:13:49.459 --> 01:13:50.725
Sidney.

01:13:51.861 --> 01:13:52.927
- Sidney?
- No.

01:13:53.863 --> 01:13:55.596
No, it's all my fault.

01:13:55.598 --> 01:13:57.732
You listen to me, this
is not your fault!

01:13:59.035 --> 01:14:01.135
You didn't ask for your
parents to get kidnapped!

01:14:02.138 --> 01:14:03.771
You didn't want this.

01:14:03.773 --> 01:14:06.207
We have to go, we have to go!

01:14:06.209 --> 01:14:07.875
- Stacey, no!
- What?

01:14:09.078 --> 01:14:11.145
I can't have that,
too, on my conscience.

01:14:11.147 --> 01:14:13.481
No, you do not
make that decision!

01:14:13.483 --> 01:14:15.550
- What?
- Let's go!

01:14:15.552 --> 01:14:16.484
No, no, no!

01:14:16.486 --> 01:14:17.185
We got to go.

01:14:17.187 --> 01:14:18.219
We got to go.

01:14:19.088 --> 01:14:20.021
Come on.

01:14:20.023 --> 01:14:21.155
Come on.

01:14:21.157 --> 01:14:22.223
Come on!

01:14:22.225 --> 01:14:23.958
Oh, Stacey!

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:24.960
Oh, my God!

01:14:29.232 --> 01:14:30.998
Slow. Slow.

01:14:32.535 --> 01:14:34.535
Stop, stop the fuckin' car.

01:14:38.808 --> 01:14:41.042
Okay, get out slowly.

01:14:42.045 --> 01:14:43.978
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:46.781
I'm sure you have a
backup on you somewhere.

01:14:46.783 --> 01:14:47.783
Go.

01:14:50.987 --> 01:14:54.522
Okay, hey, keep your
back turned to me.

01:14:54.524 --> 01:14:56.524
Hands on your head.

01:14:56.526 --> 01:14:59.527
All right, you're
gonna lead the way.

01:14:59.529 --> 01:15:02.063
Any sudden movements
means you're dead, copy?

01:15:02.065 --> 01:15:03.130
- Yeah.
- 'Kay.

01:15:12.075 --> 01:15:16.978
Aw, shit.

01:15:16.980 --> 01:15:17.980
Slow.

01:15:19.549 --> 01:15:21.015
Okay, check him.

01:15:21.985 --> 01:15:22.985
Grab his wallet.

01:15:27.557 --> 01:15:28.557
Give it.

01:15:30.226 --> 01:15:31.592
Hands on your head.

01:15:31.594 --> 01:15:32.627
Hands on your head!

01:15:36.599 --> 01:15:37.732
Fuck.

01:15:37.734 --> 01:15:38.734
Stand up.

01:15:39.569 --> 01:15:40.902
All right, let's go inside.

01:15:43.006 --> 01:15:44.006
Move.

01:15:50.713 --> 01:15:52.580
Nice and slow.

01:15:52.582 --> 01:15:54.115
Shit, this is not good.

01:16:01.157 --> 01:16:03.090
Looks like an eye
for an eye to me.

01:16:04.594 --> 01:16:06.294
I guess we're done here.

01:16:07.597 --> 01:16:08.729
Hands up!

01:16:09.999 --> 01:16:10.999
Talk.

01:16:13.002 --> 01:16:15.069
God, where do I start?

01:16:16.773 --> 01:16:19.340
At the beginning, I'd guess.

01:16:22.745 --> 01:16:25.613
Hey, can we get started?

01:16:25.615 --> 01:16:28.049
In a couple of hours,
it should be ready,

01:16:28.051 --> 01:16:29.083
but you won't.

01:16:29.085 --> 01:16:31.619
We need to get your
body temperature down

01:16:31.621 --> 01:16:32.253
and induce a medical coma.

01:16:32.255 --> 01:16:33.988
We need to get started.

01:16:35.224 --> 01:16:37.892
Just let me make a few calls.

01:16:37.894 --> 01:16:41.062
We need four to five
hours to prep you, Oliver.

01:16:41.064 --> 01:16:43.297
We definitely need to
get started, like, now.

01:16:43.299 --> 01:16:45.633
Absolutely, just let
me make a few calls.

01:16:45.635 --> 01:16:46.801
I'll be right back.

01:16:46.803 --> 01:16:49.770
Did we get all of this
guy's information?

01:16:49.772 --> 01:16:51.238
Yes, we are securing
off-shore accounts

01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:52.840
- in his name right now.
- Okay.

01:16:52.842 --> 01:16:55.042
I guess I should say your name.

01:16:55.044 --> 01:16:57.044
John Michael Willis.

01:16:57.046 --> 01:16:59.013
John Michael Willis?

01:17:00.316 --> 01:17:01.616
Now, you're gettin' it.

01:17:02.785 --> 01:17:03.884
I'll be right back.

01:17:39.088 --> 01:17:42.056
Charlie is dead,

01:17:43.159 --> 01:17:45.793
your husband is dead,

01:17:47.096 --> 01:17:48.295
and I can't reach Sam.

01:17:49.866 --> 01:17:52.733
If you let us go,
I have enough money

01:17:52.735 --> 01:17:54.702
that you could just disappear

01:17:54.704 --> 01:17:56.303
and you could live a long life.

01:17:58.408 --> 01:18:00.841
Don't you wish it was that easy.

01:18:00.843 --> 01:18:02.677
Why isn't it?

01:18:05.782 --> 01:18:07.314
I can't just walk away.

01:18:08.851 --> 01:18:13.187
Charlie is dead and I got a
bad feeling Sam is dead, too.

01:18:14.257 --> 01:18:16.390
And leaves Oliver and
whoever he's with.

01:18:16.392 --> 01:18:20.761
And from what he tells me,
he can look like anybody,

01:18:20.763 --> 01:18:23.998
so how the hell am I supposed
to have peace of mind?

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.067
Just disappear, that's all.

01:18:27.737 --> 01:18:31.872
Oh, just disappear?

01:18:31.874 --> 01:18:36.210
Where hundreds of millions
of dollars can't reach?

01:18:37.747 --> 01:18:40.147
But, I don't know,
why would he care?

01:18:45.021 --> 01:18:46.353
Because I know.

01:18:48.491 --> 01:18:49.491
Yeah.

01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:51.960
I know.

01:18:57.166 --> 01:18:59.967
We know where Oliver
lives and where he works,

01:19:01.037 --> 01:19:03.104
but we don't know much
about this kidnapper.

01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:05.773
But this fucker does.

01:19:08.778 --> 01:19:10.244
I don't much about him.

01:19:12.048 --> 01:19:14.115
We got assigned together.

01:19:14.117 --> 01:19:15.117
You smell that?

01:19:16.052 --> 01:19:17.451
- No.
- It smells like bullshit.

01:19:18.855 --> 01:19:22.523
You really expect me to
believe that you'd hire a team,

01:19:22.525 --> 01:19:24.792
you don't have synergy
with individuals?

01:19:26.129 --> 01:19:27.528
They don't know their roles?

01:19:28.831 --> 01:19:30.798
They don't stay in their lanes?

01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:32.166
Come on, Sam.

01:19:33.002 --> 01:19:36.337
Sammy.

01:19:36.339 --> 01:19:37.471
I'm not fuckin' stupid.

01:19:37.473 --> 01:19:38.473
Come on, man.

01:19:39.275 --> 01:19:40.275
His name is Carter.

01:19:41.210 --> 01:19:42.343
He's ex-CIA.

01:19:42.345 --> 01:19:44.311
I've done two
extractions with him.

01:19:46.115 --> 01:19:46.981
- Happy?
- Two?

01:19:46.983 --> 01:19:48.249
No, I'm not happy.

01:19:48.251 --> 01:19:49.416
Two extractions?

01:19:51.387 --> 01:19:53.020
And where is Carter now?

01:19:57.393 --> 01:20:00.494
Last I knew, he was staking
out her friend's place.

01:20:01.898 --> 01:20:04.498
I'd say that's
pretty goddam obvious

01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:05.933
since he has them both.

01:20:07.503 --> 01:20:09.970
And I'm not so sure I should
believe in this bullshit

01:20:09.972 --> 01:20:12.840
about you not having
a FUBAR location

01:20:12.842 --> 01:20:14.508
'cause that also
smells like bullshit.

01:20:14.510 --> 01:20:17.178
Don't know what to tell you.

01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:19.480
All right, little boy,
keep your mouth shut.

01:20:27.523 --> 01:20:31.592
I guess we can wait or storm
a heavily-guarded mansion.

01:20:33.863 --> 01:20:34.863
I vote wait.

01:20:43.005 --> 01:20:45.873
Let's drop the subject down
another two degrees, okay?

01:20:47.877 --> 01:20:51.011
And let's slow the heartbeat
and the breathing down

01:20:51.013 --> 01:20:53.347
at least another 20%.

01:20:53.349 --> 01:20:54.315
I'm on it.

01:20:54.317 --> 01:20:55.916
I need benzodiazepine stat

01:20:55.918 --> 01:20:57.618
and start morphine, phase two.

01:20:59.555 --> 01:21:02.056
Next, we need the
ice packs, okay?

01:21:02.058 --> 01:21:04.291
Let's lower both of
them down, all right?

01:21:04.293 --> 01:21:09.163
To like 15 degrees Celsius
and hold them there, please?

01:21:09.165 --> 01:21:11.098
Let's hold 'em down, okay?

01:21:14.437 --> 01:21:15.502
Okay, Magnus.

01:21:17.039 --> 01:21:18.205
Ready?

01:21:18.207 --> 01:21:19.640
If I ever was.

01:21:26.048 --> 01:21:30.217
I don't know, maybe
waiting was a bad idea.

01:21:30.219 --> 01:21:31.952
Maybe we need to.

01:21:40.096 --> 01:21:41.096
Hello?

01:21:42.598 --> 01:21:43.598
Who is this?

01:21:44.467 --> 01:21:46.367
It's a friend of the family.

01:21:46.369 --> 01:21:51.372
Ah, well, you're gonna want
to do exactly what I say.

01:21:51.374 --> 01:21:55.175
Welp, I think we have
things to talk about here.

01:21:56.078 --> 01:21:57.078
It's your dad.

01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:00.080
Tell him we need to talk.

01:22:00.082 --> 01:22:01.382
He's military, we're lost.

01:22:01.384 --> 01:22:02.616
Hey, it's me again.

01:22:03.953 --> 01:22:06.420
Okay, what do you want?

01:22:06.422 --> 01:22:09.290
A trade, get your
little boy back

01:22:10.259 --> 01:22:11.592
and I get May and Bridget.

01:22:15.231 --> 01:22:16.697
Nice try but no deal.

01:22:18.100 --> 01:22:19.100
You sure?

01:22:22.405 --> 01:22:23.637
What about now?

01:22:25.308 --> 01:22:26.828
Listen,

01:22:27.710 --> 01:22:31.145
you can have the girl,
but I'm keeping the lady.

01:22:31.147 --> 01:22:33.580
She's worth $400 million.

01:22:34.417 --> 01:22:36.250
'Kay, deal.

01:22:36.252 --> 01:22:37.985
We meet in a public area.

01:22:37.987 --> 01:22:39.520
I'll call you back
in 10 minutes.

01:22:42.124 --> 01:22:43.124
Yes?

01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:46.727
Ah, Sofia, please.

01:22:47.997 --> 01:22:49.396
Yeah, thank you.

01:22:49.398 --> 01:22:51.532
May I ask what
this is regarding?

01:22:51.534 --> 01:22:53.334
It sounded urgent.

01:22:53.336 --> 01:22:55.269
Well, I haven't been able

01:22:55.271 --> 01:22:58.339
to reach Jeremy,
Magnus, or Oliver.

01:22:59.608 --> 01:23:01.308
Of course, Bridget's
still missing.

01:23:01.310 --> 01:23:02.609
So, yeah, I'm worried.

01:23:03.679 --> 01:23:06.080
Well, yes, I would be as well.

01:23:06.082 --> 01:23:07.414
Well, would you happen to know

01:23:07.416 --> 01:23:09.049
where any of them are?

01:23:09.051 --> 01:23:10.551
I can call him.

01:23:10.553 --> 01:23:13.120
But it is possible
that he's just busy.

01:23:14.557 --> 01:23:16.023
I already called.

01:23:16.025 --> 01:23:18.359
We have an entire
dual unit missing.

01:23:18.361 --> 01:23:20.027
Would you happen
to know why that is

01:23:20.029 --> 01:23:21.462
or where it might be?

01:23:21.464 --> 01:23:24.631
Seems that Magnus and Oliver
checked it out for testing.

01:23:25.568 --> 01:23:26.767
No, sir.

01:23:27.703 --> 01:23:29.370
No, I don't.

01:23:30.439 --> 01:23:32.339
Now, if you're trying
to insinuate something,

01:23:32.341 --> 01:23:34.041
let me remind you,

01:23:34.043 --> 01:23:36.176
I have been a long-time
supporter of Bridget

01:23:36.178 --> 01:23:37.745
and I have been here longer
than any other scientist...

01:23:37.747 --> 01:23:39.046
- Sofia, Sofia, no!
- I have sat...

01:23:39.048 --> 01:23:41.148
No, I'm not
insinuating anything.

01:23:42.251 --> 01:23:43.251
Nothing at all.

01:23:44.253 --> 01:23:45.552
Hell, at least you're here

01:23:46.722 --> 01:23:48.222
and that tells me a lot,

01:23:48.224 --> 01:23:50.524
but I still need to figure
out what's going on.

01:23:54.230 --> 01:23:55.596
I can't think of anything

01:23:55.598 --> 01:23:57.498
that could possibly
be of any use.

01:23:57.500 --> 01:23:59.199
I'm so sorry.

01:23:59.201 --> 01:24:00.134
It's okay.

01:24:00.136 --> 01:24:03.470
If anything turns up,
please don't hesitate, okay?

01:24:03.472 --> 01:24:05.739
Of course, of course.

01:24:05.741 --> 01:24:07.408
- Sir?
- Hmm?

01:24:08.677 --> 01:24:09.743
Are we in danger?

01:24:11.614 --> 01:24:12.614
Okay?

01:24:14.483 --> 01:24:15.483
What now?

01:24:18.554 --> 01:24:19.587
We both go on three.

01:24:19.588 --> 01:24:20.621
They both walk separate
and turn back to back

01:24:20.623 --> 01:24:22.356
when they pass each other.

01:24:22.358 --> 01:24:23.757
Okay.

01:24:23.759 --> 01:24:25.159
Don't fuck this up!

01:24:26.662 --> 01:24:27.828
We're not done yet.

01:24:29.098 --> 01:24:31.432
Shut the fuck up and
do as you're told.

01:24:32.401 --> 01:24:33.434
Okay, here we go.

01:24:34.370 --> 01:24:35.370
One.

01:24:36.238 --> 01:24:37.638
Two.

01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:39.139
Three, walk!

01:24:56.292 --> 01:24:57.292
Pow!

01:25:10.706 --> 01:25:12.539
They have nothing linking
us to the apartment,

01:25:12.541 --> 01:25:14.675
so you should be safe here.

01:25:15.811 --> 01:25:18.512
Which means, you two,
stay put from now on.

01:25:20.182 --> 01:25:21.281
What about my mom?

01:25:22.551 --> 01:25:23.684
The more she knows,

01:25:23.686 --> 01:25:25.486
the more we risk her
safety right now.

01:25:26.322 --> 01:25:27.688
Now, she's reported you missing,

01:25:27.690 --> 01:25:31.825
so there's likely active-duty
officers at the house.

01:25:31.827 --> 01:25:33.260
She should be all right.

01:25:34.697 --> 01:25:35.762
What about my mom?

01:25:37.166 --> 01:25:39.500
I still need to
figure that part out.

01:25:40.569 --> 01:25:42.369
I'm gonna need to
see David, again.

01:25:43.639 --> 01:25:45.573
That could be risky,

01:25:45.574 --> 01:25:47.508
so we're gonna need to
come up with a plan B

01:25:47.510 --> 01:25:50.644
if I'm caught or worse.

01:25:57.853 --> 01:26:00.354
You got this, Corey.

01:26:03.726 --> 01:26:05.626
Unfortunately, you have to rest

01:26:05.628 --> 01:26:07.394
a little while
longer, sweetheart.

01:26:08.731 --> 01:26:09.731
All set.

01:26:10.799 --> 01:26:11.932
Now, we wait.

01:26:12.902 --> 01:26:14.268
Thank you, Magnus.

01:26:14.270 --> 01:26:15.802
We couldn't have done
this without you.

01:26:17.606 --> 01:26:19.273
I'm curious.

01:26:19.275 --> 01:26:20.841
I mean, I know why I did it.

01:26:21.810 --> 01:26:22.810
What about you?

01:26:23.879 --> 01:26:27.748
My wife, she passed from cancer.

01:26:27.750 --> 01:26:30.284
I mean, it spread.

01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:31.952
It was everywhere.

01:26:34.523 --> 01:26:37.491
This, this right here,

01:26:37.493 --> 01:26:38.859
this woulda saved her.

01:26:39.662 --> 01:26:40.662
I'm sorry.

01:26:41.797 --> 01:26:43.497
Hopefully, that won't happen

01:26:43.499 --> 01:26:44.898
to anyone else.

01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:47.568
That makes this kill
a little bit easier.

01:26:52.908 --> 01:26:54.908
Go see your wife, Magnus.

01:26:54.910 --> 01:26:56.310
She's waiting for you.

01:27:00.649 --> 01:27:03.784
Charlie is dead because of her!

01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:07.521
Charlie's dead because of you.

01:27:08.424 --> 01:27:10.724
You and your fucking friend.

01:27:18.801 --> 01:27:23.604
You think you're so
perfect, don't you?

01:27:24.974 --> 01:27:27.341
You think you're so damn smart.

01:27:29.578 --> 01:27:32.946
Being born with a silver
spoon in your mouth,

01:27:32.948 --> 01:27:36.416
you don't know what it's
like to go without, huh?

01:27:40.856 --> 01:27:44.925
I wasn't born with a
silver spoon in my mouth.

01:27:47.496 --> 01:27:49.363
I was born poor.

01:27:51.467 --> 01:27:53.367
You shoulda done your homework.

01:27:55.571 --> 01:27:57.571
I often didn't eat

01:27:57.573 --> 01:28:00.307
other than what they
fed you at school.

01:28:00.309 --> 01:28:02.643
When it wasn't a school
day, I did without.

01:28:04.713 --> 01:28:06.380
See, my father was an immigrant

01:28:07.449 --> 01:28:10.017
and he worked his ass
off to make changes

01:28:10.019 --> 01:28:11.785
so that we would have a future.

01:28:12.988 --> 01:28:15.622
And he knew that if he
just put everything he had

01:28:15.624 --> 01:28:17.891
into education that, eventually,

01:28:17.893 --> 01:28:19.393
everything would be okay.

01:28:20.596 --> 01:28:22.462
You know what he
didn't do, though?

01:28:24.466 --> 01:28:26.667
He didn't compromise
his character.

01:28:28.637 --> 01:28:29.870
Do you know what that means

01:28:29.872 --> 01:28:31.738
or would you like me
to explain it to you?

01:28:35.344 --> 01:28:37.544
You hear Mother
Teresa over here?

01:28:38.547 --> 01:28:42.749
Yeah, I said don't talk to her.

01:28:42.751 --> 01:28:43.751
Let her be.

01:28:47.890 --> 01:28:49.956
You wanna judge my character?

01:28:53.028 --> 01:28:55.996
How is this for character, huh?

01:28:56.932 --> 01:28:58.765
Huh, smarty?

01:28:58.767 --> 01:28:59.966
Looks like I hit a nerve.

01:28:59.968 --> 01:29:01.768
- Didn't I?
- Oh, yeah.

01:29:01.770 --> 01:29:05.505
Just a bullet, just a
bullet right in her brain.

01:29:05.507 --> 01:29:06.507
Carter.

01:29:08.377 --> 01:29:09.443
Walk it off.

01:29:23.992 --> 01:29:25.659
So, today, before we adjourn,

01:29:25.661 --> 01:29:27.694
I just wanna say
how pleased I am

01:29:27.696 --> 01:29:29.930
that we were able to,
in Bridget's absence,

01:29:29.932 --> 01:29:32.733
we were able to pass a vote
holding off on the merger.

01:29:33.802 --> 01:29:38.071
And, you know, William
would be so proud

01:29:38.073 --> 01:29:39.673
to see how we
conducted ourselves

01:29:39.675 --> 01:29:41.408
in challenging times like this.

01:29:42.945 --> 01:29:47.547
And I, for one, I'm damn proud
to stand with all of you.

01:29:49.551 --> 01:29:51.618
So, once again, thank you.

01:29:52.821 --> 01:29:53.954
That's all I have.

01:30:10.038 --> 01:30:12.439
Hey, Mark is dead.

01:30:12.441 --> 01:30:13.640
Yeah, I know, I heard.

01:30:15.978 --> 01:30:17.577
Damn shame.

01:30:17.579 --> 01:30:19.646
Bridget is still missing.

01:30:19.648 --> 01:30:20.648
Any leads?

01:30:21.717 --> 01:30:23.450
Just the men Sam used.

01:30:23.452 --> 01:30:25.018
They're hard to trace.

01:30:25.020 --> 01:30:26.720
Where's Oliver?

01:30:26.722 --> 01:30:27.721
That's the odd thing.

01:30:27.723 --> 01:30:30.590
He's gone and before he left,

01:30:30.592 --> 01:30:31.925
he and our top
scientist, Magnus,

01:30:31.927 --> 01:30:35.095
checked out a dual
unit, fully operational.

01:30:38.467 --> 01:30:39.933
And Magnus isn't at work today.

01:30:41.637 --> 01:30:43.003
- I have a bad...
- So you're saying

01:30:43.005 --> 01:30:44.738
they checked out
medical equipment?

01:30:44.740 --> 01:30:46.139
Mm-hmm, fully operational.

01:30:46.141 --> 01:30:48.809
And they can switch
their brains?

01:30:48.811 --> 01:30:51.011
Mm-hmm, yeah.

01:30:51.013 --> 01:30:52.813
Jesus Christ, and
you can't trace that?

01:30:52.815 --> 01:30:55.515
All we have are
their signatures,

01:30:55.517 --> 01:30:57.517
but I called security and
they're pulling up surveillance

01:30:57.519 --> 01:30:59.953
to see if we can identify
the truck they left in.

01:31:00.756 --> 01:31:02.889
Find the truck, find the gear,

01:31:02.891 --> 01:31:04.825
and that will lead
us right to them.

01:31:06.028 --> 01:31:08.595
Yeah, do you wanna come
with me to security?

01:31:09.565 --> 01:31:10.565
Sure, why not?

01:31:14.169 --> 01:31:16.636
You wanna not call
the guards this time?

01:31:26.815 --> 01:31:30.817
Sam, we can't hold her forever.

01:31:30.819 --> 01:31:32.919
We'll need to figure
something else out.

01:31:32.921 --> 01:31:35.121
- Yeah, I know.
- You know?

01:31:37.192 --> 01:31:39.059
What about their company?

01:31:39.061 --> 01:31:40.061
They pay.

01:31:41.830 --> 01:31:42.830
Maybe.

01:31:44.833 --> 01:31:46.199
The other company?

01:31:46.201 --> 01:31:49.736
They'd rather see her dead.

01:31:50.973 --> 01:31:54.741
Hmm, somebody
else wants to see you dead.

01:31:59.014 --> 01:32:01.014
Yeah, I could see that.

01:32:02.551 --> 01:32:04.150
This David guy.

01:32:05.220 --> 01:32:07.954
David, who's David?

01:32:07.956 --> 01:32:13.026
Yeah, I went to his
house with Oliver.

01:32:13.862 --> 01:32:15.629
He seems to be close
with the family.

01:32:17.566 --> 01:32:18.566
It's worth a shot.

01:32:19.234 --> 01:32:21.268
Should I pay them a visit?

01:32:21.270 --> 01:32:22.769
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:32:33.916 --> 01:32:36.116
I'll text you his address.

01:32:38.921 --> 01:32:39.921
You got it.

01:32:46.328 --> 01:32:47.328
There!

01:32:48.263 --> 01:32:49.796
I'll be damned.

01:32:50.666 --> 01:32:51.998
How do we trace that?

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:53.133
Well, it's one of ours.

01:32:53.135 --> 01:32:54.267
They all have homing
devices on it,

01:32:54.269 --> 01:32:55.835
so it shouldn't be too hard.

01:32:56.772 --> 01:32:58.138
Let's check this out.

01:32:58.140 --> 01:33:02.275
We could just take a look here.

01:33:02.277 --> 01:33:06.046
Should be able to locate
all of our trucks.

01:33:06.048 --> 01:33:07.881
There, there,
that's got to be it!

01:33:07.883 --> 01:33:09.883
Where is that?

01:33:09.884 --> 01:33:11.884
Looks like the storage
place down by the freeway.

01:33:11.887 --> 01:33:13.820
'Kay, let me check it out.

01:33:15.023 --> 01:33:16.856
No, we got to call in the police.

01:33:16.858 --> 01:33:18.725
Who knows what we'll
find when we get there.

01:33:18.727 --> 01:33:21.294
No, there's no time, no police.

01:33:21.296 --> 01:33:22.796
That could get messy.

01:33:22.798 --> 01:33:24.764
If I can't bring
her back safely,

01:33:24.766 --> 01:33:26.232
then you call the police,

01:33:26.234 --> 01:33:28.234
but give me the chance.

01:33:28.236 --> 01:33:30.670
Okay, you have tonight.

01:33:30.672 --> 01:33:32.305
But tomorrow I
call in the police.

01:33:34.042 --> 01:33:35.942
You're a good man, David.

01:33:35.944 --> 01:33:37.711
Now, go home, get some rest.

01:33:40.182 --> 01:33:41.648
Dammit.

01:34:06.241 --> 01:34:07.807
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:34:07.809 --> 01:34:09.643
- What are you doin' here?
- What?

01:34:10.712 --> 01:34:11.811
We've had some complaints about

01:34:11.813 --> 01:34:12.979
a bunch of commotion down here

01:34:12.981 --> 01:34:15.815
and I didn't sign off
on any night work.

01:34:17.019 --> 01:34:18.752
I'm just helpin' 'em out here.

01:34:18.754 --> 01:34:20.754
Helping them with what?

01:34:20.756 --> 01:34:21.988
Do you have a
badge or something?

01:34:21.990 --> 01:34:24.124
Yeah, here's my badge.

01:34:24.126 --> 01:34:25.959
- Now, what are you workin' on?
- Hey.

01:34:25.961 --> 01:34:27.027
I'm just helpin'
'em move equipment.

01:34:27.029 --> 01:34:28.294
Open the door.

01:34:30.232 --> 01:34:31.232
Go.

01:34:42.010 --> 01:34:43.376
What's goin' on?

01:34:43.378 --> 01:34:44.711
What are you doing here?

01:34:44.713 --> 01:34:46.846
I'd like to ask
you the same thing.

01:34:46.848 --> 01:34:49.049
I have permission and
clearance to be here.

01:34:49.985 --> 01:34:50.984
Do you?

01:34:50.986 --> 01:34:52.452
I say I call the police

01:34:52.454 --> 01:34:54.187
and they can sort this shit out.

01:34:54.189 --> 01:34:56.056
Wait, hold on.

01:34:56.992 --> 01:34:58.391
Let's talk.

01:34:58.393 --> 01:34:59.726
Sure.

01:35:03.765 --> 01:35:05.065
Location B, stat!

01:35:11.139 --> 01:35:12.939
What should we do?

01:35:14.910 --> 01:35:15.975
I'm not sure.

01:35:19.014 --> 01:35:20.346
But the longer it goes on,

01:35:22.751 --> 01:35:24.017
the less safe we are here.

01:35:34.162 --> 01:35:36.463
Hold on, hold on, he's coming.

01:35:47.109 --> 01:35:51.978
Oh, my God.

01:35:53.315 --> 01:35:57.183
Well, I guess we
know that Oliver

01:35:57.185 --> 01:35:59.919
and this Magnus guy
are both in on it.

01:35:59.921 --> 01:36:02.322
They likely brought in
mercenaries to grab Bridget.

01:36:02.324 --> 01:36:04.390
I'd say it's likely
they still have her.

01:36:05.827 --> 01:36:07.060
She's worth money alive,

01:36:08.797 --> 01:36:09.863
not so much dead.

01:36:15.003 --> 01:36:17.804
I also ran into some people
in at a storage facility.

01:36:19.407 --> 01:36:22.075
They turned a unit into
a medical science room.

01:36:23.011 --> 01:36:24.210
I'm starting to think

01:36:24.212 --> 01:36:27.947
that this whole thing
is too big for us.

01:36:27.949 --> 01:36:30.817
I think it's time to
call in the police.

01:36:30.819 --> 01:36:32.819
Do you think my
mom is still alive?

01:36:32.821 --> 01:36:35.021
Yeah, I do.

01:36:35.023 --> 01:36:38.024
How do we know the
police are not in on it?

01:36:38.026 --> 01:36:41.561
I mean, May, she had a shady
detective at her place.

01:36:47.035 --> 01:36:49.369
I just, I don't know
what to do right now.

01:36:52.841 --> 01:36:53.841
Hold on.

01:36:56.511 --> 01:36:57.877
Hello?

01:36:57.879 --> 01:37:00.246
David tells me you
can get shit done.

01:37:00.248 --> 01:37:01.881
Is that true?

01:37:01.882 --> 01:37:03.515
Depends, I'm not great
with balloon animals

01:37:03.518 --> 01:37:05.385
and I don't do clowns.

01:37:07.389 --> 01:37:09.389
I have Bridget and David.

01:37:09.391 --> 01:37:12.859
I don't give a shit
about anything but money.

01:37:12.861 --> 01:37:16.930
I want $2 million today
and you can have them both.

01:37:16.932 --> 01:37:18.531
Where the hell am I gonna
get that kinda money?

01:37:18.533 --> 01:37:22.535
Not my problem, make it happen.

01:37:22.537 --> 01:37:24.437
I'll call you after
the banks close today

01:37:24.439 --> 01:37:26.573
and we can work this out.

01:37:26.575 --> 01:37:27.575
But I.

01:37:37.018 --> 01:37:38.018
Slow, my love.

01:37:39.421 --> 01:37:40.421
Don't rush.

01:37:42.457 --> 01:37:45.291
Come to me when you're ready.

01:37:45.293 --> 01:37:46.492
I'll be here.

01:37:57.572 --> 01:38:00.440
Are you sure about this?

01:38:00.442 --> 01:38:04.110
No, but what are we gonna do?

01:38:04.112 --> 01:38:07.180
We can't keep these
two here forever.

01:38:07.182 --> 01:38:10.049
Besides, they seen our faces.

01:38:10.051 --> 01:38:12.352
Yeah.

01:38:12.354 --> 01:38:13.653
You're right.

01:38:13.655 --> 01:38:16.055
There's not a
lotta options left.

01:38:16.057 --> 01:38:18.191
So you gonna call
or you want me to?

01:38:19.060 --> 01:38:20.060
I got it.

01:38:29.104 --> 01:38:30.203
Hello?

01:38:30.205 --> 01:38:32.105
Hey, did you get the money yet?

01:38:32.107 --> 01:38:33.473
Maybe, not sure.

01:38:34.342 --> 01:38:35.942
Maybe, what the fuck?

01:38:35.944 --> 01:38:37.477
Do you wanna see these
two mother fuckers

01:38:37.479 --> 01:38:39.012
alive again or what?

01:38:39.014 --> 01:38:40.647
Honestly, I don't know them.

01:38:40.649 --> 01:38:42.081
You're talking to a homeless guy

01:38:42.083 --> 01:38:44.117
and a hooker that got
wrapped up in this shit.

01:38:44.119 --> 01:38:46.085
We did the best we can.

01:38:46.087 --> 01:38:51.024
Okay, Packard plant, 10 o'clock.

01:38:52.527 --> 01:38:54.093
Come alone.

01:38:54.095 --> 01:38:56.462
You fuck around and these
two fuckers are dead.

01:38:57.632 --> 01:39:00.366
Packard plant, 10:00
p.m., copy that.

01:39:03.972 --> 01:39:06.506
You bring them both.

01:39:48.216 --> 01:39:49.216
Hello?

01:39:50.018 --> 01:39:51.484
Are you here?

01:39:51.486 --> 01:39:53.619
- Yes.
- Alone?

01:39:53.621 --> 01:39:55.621
- Yep.
- Got the money?

01:39:58.059 --> 01:39:59.158
Yes.

01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:01.427
- Where are you?
- I'm inside.

01:40:01.429 --> 01:40:02.428
You'll see me.

01:40:02.430 --> 01:40:03.430
Stay put.

01:40:07.702 --> 01:40:08.702
Let's rock.

01:40:20.582 --> 01:40:21.647
Where ya at?

01:40:24.586 --> 01:40:26.753
Come out where we can see you.

01:40:26.755 --> 01:40:28.154
Nice and easy.

01:40:29.057 --> 01:40:30.523
Don't try anything stupid.

01:40:31.593 --> 01:40:33.192
Everybody wants to
go home tonight.

01:40:33.194 --> 01:40:34.560
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

01:40:36.064 --> 01:40:37.797
Ah, fuck, where is he?

01:40:42.604 --> 01:40:44.437
You guys, over there.

01:41:08.563 --> 01:41:11.164
I only want to do some
business with you.

01:41:12.367 --> 01:41:13.833
Where the fuck is he?

01:41:17.238 --> 01:41:18.238
Carter!

01:41:22.444 --> 01:41:23.444
Gringo?

01:41:32.687 --> 01:41:36.355
I only wanna make some
business with you.

01:41:52.674 --> 01:41:53.674
Gringo?

01:41:57.145 --> 01:41:58.811
You brought the money.

01:42:10.158 --> 01:42:12.492
Touche, you son of a bitch.

01:42:20.335 --> 01:42:23.503
I see, you wanna
play fuckin' games!

01:42:24.572 --> 01:42:26.772
You wanna play
fuckin' games, huh?

01:42:26.774 --> 01:42:28.908
All right, we'll
play fuckin' games.

01:42:28.910 --> 01:42:30.776
Who's it gonna be?

01:42:30.778 --> 01:42:33.813
Is it gonna be her or
is it gonna be him?

01:42:34.716 --> 01:42:36.716
Who's it gonna be, motherfucker?

01:42:36.718 --> 01:42:37.718
Her or him?

01:42:45.793 --> 01:42:46.759
David.

01:42:46.761 --> 01:42:47.727
- No, he's okay.
- Are you hurt?

01:42:47.729 --> 01:42:49.195
- Are you hurt?
- He's okay.

01:42:49.197 --> 01:42:52.732
- No, get her undone.
- I'm a friend.

01:42:52.734 --> 01:42:54.867
Ah.

01:42:54.869 --> 01:42:56.235
Ah.

01:42:56.237 --> 01:42:57.503
Come on, come on.

01:42:57.505 --> 01:42:58.804
It's okay, let's go, let's go.

01:43:11.352 --> 01:43:12.552
- Mom?
- Oh, Miranda!

01:43:12.554 --> 01:43:16.255
Oh, Miranda!

01:43:16.257 --> 01:43:17.257
Oh, May.

01:43:18.359 --> 01:43:19.359
I got you.

01:43:24.232 --> 01:43:25.598
I got you.

01:43:31.372 --> 01:43:32.772
Bridget, got a minute?

01:43:32.774 --> 01:43:34.707
Sure, John,
what can I help you with?

01:43:35.510 --> 01:43:36.909
I'd like you to meet Joanna.

01:43:38.446 --> 01:43:40.246
She just started
where Magnus left off

01:43:40.248 --> 01:43:42.748
and she's excited
to be on board.

01:43:43.785 --> 01:43:45.651
Hmm, well, welcome.

01:43:45.653 --> 01:43:46.986
Thank you.

01:43:46.988 --> 01:43:48.521
I look forward to getting
to know you better.

01:43:48.523 --> 01:43:49.789
We'll go over more next week,

01:43:49.791 --> 01:43:51.824
give you a chance
to get acclimated.

01:43:51.826 --> 01:43:53.526
I look forward to it.

01:43:53.528 --> 01:43:55.261
I have heard so much about you.
