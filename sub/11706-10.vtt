A GIRL HOME TONIGHT.

17:31.425 --> 17:34.720

{\an8}THEY'RE BOTH GOING
TO GET PINK EYE.

36:31.147 --> 36:32.815
{\an8}- GOOD.

36:38.738 --> 36:40.990
{\an8}- THAT'S GROSS.

36:41.073 --> 36:42.700
{\an8}SMELLS LIKE GARBAGE.

36:42.783 --> 36:44.410
{\an8}- OH, MY GOD.

36:44.493 --> 36:46.746
{\an8}SPEAKING OF SMELL, UGH.

36:46.829 --> 36:48.414
{\an8}I HAD THAT CHICK OVER
THE OTHER NIGHT.

36:48.497 --> 36:49.999
{\an8}UGH.
- EW!

36:50.082 --> 36:52.126
{\an8}- I HAD TO KICK HER OUT.
- WHAT SMELL WAS IT?

36:52.210 --> 36:54.420
{\an8}- IT WAS OBVIOUSLY HER,
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

36:54.503 --> 36:55.630
{\an8}IT WASN'T ME.
- BAD [bleep]?

36:55.713 --> 36:57.673
{\an8}- IT SMELLED LIKE
[bleep] GRATED CHEESE.

36:57.757 --> 36:59.634
{\an8}- OHH.
- AND--BUT--

36:59.717 --> 37:00.676
{\an8}- LIKE A SUSHI MARKET?

37:00.760 --> 37:01.719
{\an8}- NO, BUT NO, IT DIDN'T.

37:01.802 --> 37:02.678
{\an8}IT JUST SMELLED
LIKE GRATED CHEESE.

37:02.762 --> 37:04.597
{\an8}AND I WAS LIKE,
"WHAT IS THAT SMELL?"

37:04.680 --> 37:05.973
{\an8}SHE'S LIKE, "DO YOU WANT
YOUR CLOTHES BACK?"

37:06.057 --> 37:07.141
{\an8}I'M LIKE, "NO, YOU CAN
KEEP THE CLOTHES."

37:07.224 --> 37:08.142
{\an8}- GRATED CHEESE?
- YEAH.

37:08.225 --> 37:09.685
{\an8}- I THINK THE CHEESE BED

37:09.769 --> 37:12.813
{\an8}IS THE BEST PRANK
IN <i> JERSEY SHORE</i> HISTORY,

37:12.897 --> 37:16.317
{\an8}JUST BECAUSE NO ONE EVER
PRANKED MIKE LIKE THAT

37:16.400 --> 37:18.235
{\an8}AND THE FACT THAT HE THINKS
IT'S A GRENADE--

37:18.319 --> 37:20.571
{\an8}GRENADES [bleep] SMELLING
LIKE CHEESE,

37:20.655 --> 37:21.614
{\an8}WHEN, REALLY,
IT'S YOUR FRICKIN' BED

37:21.697 --> 37:23.824
{\an8}SMELLING LIKE CHEESE,
YOU'RE A SUCKER.

37:23.908 --> 37:27.495
{\an8}YOU'RE A SUCKER, BRO.

37:27.578 --> 37:28.746
{\an8}- WHAT?
- HE GOT THE GIRL OVER.

37:28.829 --> 37:29.997
{\an8}AND HE GOES,
"I COULDN'T HOOK UP WITH HER,

37:30.081 --> 37:32.750
{\an8}BECAUSE SHE SMELLED LIKE
GRATED CHEESE."

37:32.833 --> 37:35.503
{\an8}- IT IS SO EXTREMELY SATISFYING,

37:35.586 --> 37:38.839
{\an8}KNOWING THAT WE GOT, LIKE,
THE ULTIMATE PRANKER HIMSELF.

37:38.923 --> 37:41.175
{\an8}[laughter]

37:41.259 --> 37:42.510
{\an8}- THAT'S GROSS.

37:42.593 --> 37:44.136
{\an8}- THIS PRANK
IS FRIGGIN' FABULOUS.

37:44.220 --> 37:46.097
{\an8}- SHE LEFT.
I HAD TO SPRAY MY BED WITH AXE.

37:46.180 --> 37:48.557
{\an8}AND THEY SMELLED HORRIBLE.
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS.

37:48.641 --> 37:50.601
{\an8}I'M LIKE, "YO, IT SMELLS LIKE
GRATED CHEESE RIGHT NOW."

37:50.685 --> 37:53.312
{\an8}SO THEN SHE GAVE ME [bleep],
AND SHE WAS DONE,

37:53.396 --> 37:54.563
{\an8}AND I'M LIKE, "YO, I GOT
YOUR TAXI READY OUTSIDE."

37:54.647 --> 37:56.774
{\an8}- WHAT?

37:56.857 --> 37:58.526
{\an8}- YO, YOU CAN GET AN S.T.D.
FROM THAT, YOU KNOW.

37:58.609 --> 37:59.652
{\an8}- S.T.D. FROM WHAT?

37:59.735 --> 38:00.820
{\an8}YOU CAN'T GET
AN S.T.D. FROM THAT.

38:00.903 --> 38:02.530
{\an8}- YES, YOU CAN!
THAT'S A BIG WAY TO GET ONE!

38:02.613 --> 38:07.201
{\an8}- YOU CAN GET--YOU CAN
GET SOMETHING FROM [bleep]?

38:07.284 --> 38:08.703
{\an8}I DON'T THINK YOU'RE CORRECT.

38:08.786 --> 38:10.162
{\an8}- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CALL
THAT DOCTOR IN THERE?

38:10.246 --> 38:14.208
{\an8}MIKE IS SO DUMB WHEN IT COMES
TO SAFE SEX AND S.T.D.s.

38:14.291 --> 38:15.918
{\an8}I'M [bleep] CALLING
THE DOCTOR.

38:16.002 --> 38:17.837
{\an8}- [bleep].
- WE HAVE A DOCTOR IN THE BOOK.

38:17.920 --> 38:18.879
{\an8}LIKE, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

38:18.963 --> 38:19.880
{\an8}THIS GOES BACK
TO FIFTH GRADE,

38:19.964 --> 38:21.340
{\an8}LIKE, SEX EDUCATION.

38:21.424 --> 38:23.217
{\an8}YOU HAVE TO PRACTICE
SAFE SEX.

38:23.300 --> 38:26.220
{\an8}- WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SOMETHING
SMELLS LIKE GRATED CHEESE?

38:26.303 --> 38:27.096
{\an8}- YEAH, WE'RE GONNA ALSO
FIND OUT IF YOU CATCH--

38:27.179 --> 38:29.598

- GRATED CHEESE.

38:30.766 --> 38:32.643
{\an8}- MY ROOMMATES
WOULD LIKE TO KNOW

38:32.727 --> 38:35.396
{\an8}IF YOU CAN STILL CATCH
A SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE

38:35.479 --> 38:38.232
{\an8}WITHOUT USING A CONDOM
IF ONE OF MY GUYS IN THE HOUSE

38:38.315 --> 38:41.235
{\an8}GOT...ORAL...PLEASURE.

38:41.318 --> 38:42.737
{\an8}- CERTAIN ONES, YES.

38:42.820 --> 38:45.406
{\an8}USUALLY THE MAIN ONE THAT'S
CONTAGIOUS THAT WAY IS HERPES.

38:45.489 --> 38:47.783
{\an8}- THE MAIN ONE THAT'S CONTAGIOUS
THAT WAY IS HERPES.

38:47.867 --> 38:48.826
{\an8}- UGH!

38:48.909 --> 38:51.746
{\an8}- AND WE ALSO HAD
A WOMAN COME IN HERE

38:51.829 --> 38:54.457
{\an8}THAT HAD A SMELL LIKE...

39:09.764 --> 39:11.098
{\an8}I DID MAKE OUT WITH HER--

39:11.182 --> 39:11.849
{\an8}- WHICH MEANS YOU PROBABLY
MIGHT GET SOME YEAST IN YOU.

39:11.932 --> 39:14.643
