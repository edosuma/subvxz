11:15.949 --> 11:17.784
Got it, Grandpa.

11:17.819 --> 11:20.017
-Thank you so much.
-You're welcome.

11:20.052 --> 11:23.614
PAUL (fading): This is the one
that went to the moon, Grandpa.

11:23.649 --> 11:25.121
RUTH:
Oh, my God!

11:25.156 --> 11:26.617
-G-G-Get... get it away!
-TED: It's a ham...

11:26.652 --> 11:28.223
-That thing, i-it's a rat!
-No, it's a hamster.

11:28.258 --> 11:29.620
-She's not gonna hurt you.
-In the house!

11:29.655 --> 11:31.127
-It's a rat. It's a rat!
-It's-it's not a rat.

11:31.162 --> 11:32.722
-It's a hamster, Aunt Ruth.
-Get it...

11:32.757 --> 11:34.229
-Get that thing away!
-It's from a science project.

11:34.264 --> 11:35.626
-Look, I'll put it on...
-Aah! My God!

11:35.661 --> 11:37.397
-Get it out of here!
-It's not gonna hurt...

11:37.432 --> 11:39.234
-It's not gonna hurt you.
-Get it the hell out of here!

11:39.269 --> 11:40.631
-Ruthie, please, it's just
the kids' pet. -RUTH: Stop it!

11:40.666 --> 11:42.270
I'm putting it away.
I'm putting it away.

11:42.305 --> 11:43.403
We had enough of those
growing up, Mickey.

11:43.438 --> 11:44.470
Hey, Grandpa.

11:44.505 --> 11:46.208
-Hey. How you doing?
-PAUL: Seriously?

11:46.243 --> 11:47.308
What are you reading?

11:47.343 --> 11:49.079
-What's that?
-Hey, you.

11:49.114 --> 11:51.081
-Stop.
-What's the rocket?

11:51.116 --> 11:52.643
It's for school.

11:52.678 --> 11:54.381
You mean fake school?

11:54.416 --> 11:56.119
You actually have to work
at my school

11:56.154 --> 11:57.714
and get real punishment.

11:57.749 --> 11:59.287
Ask me if I care, Ted.

11:59.322 --> 12:01.124
ESTHER: All right, everybody,
get ready for dinner.

12:01.159 --> 12:03.830
IRVING (grunts):
Well, it's not the compressor.

12:03.865 --> 12:05.722
(radio playing indistinctly)

12:05.757 --> 12:07.394
Irving, I need my oven.

12:07.429 --> 12:09.660
IRVING:
Esther, I have to fix this.

12:09.695 --> 12:11.068
What's going on here?

12:11.103 --> 12:12.564
-Hi, Dad.
-Hi.

12:12.599 --> 12:14.269
-I don't know the story.
-What's happening?

12:14.304 --> 12:15.501
IRVING:
Aaron, maybe you could...

12:15.536 --> 12:17.008
maybe you could help me
with this.

12:17.043 --> 12:18.944
I'm trying to figure out
why it's making

12:18.979 --> 12:20.737
this grinding sound.

12:20.772 --> 12:22.343
And, uh, I think maybe

12:22.378 --> 12:24.345
-the Freon... Freon lines...
-(Grandpa stammering)

12:24.380 --> 12:26.248
-ESTHER: Dad, watch your suit.
-GRANDPA: Yeah.

12:26.283 --> 12:28.921
There's a defrost timer.
Try that.

12:28.956 --> 12:31.220
-The defrost timer?
-Yeah.

12:32.322 --> 12:34.685
-What you need?
-Can you get me my socket set?

12:34.720 --> 12:36.489
-(making whooshing noises)
-(indistinct chatter)

12:36.524 --> 12:38.931
-What are you doing?
-Ow! Why'd you do that?

12:38.966 --> 12:41.032
-Because I felt like it.
-Stop, you idiot!

12:41.067 --> 12:42.363
Yeah, whatever, shithead.

12:42.398 --> 12:44.266
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

12:44.301 --> 12:45.531
-Um...
-PAUL: Ma?

12:45.566 --> 12:47.467
Ted pinged my ear.

12:47.502 --> 12:49.667
-Ma!
-What? I heard you.

12:49.702 --> 12:50.976
So?

12:51.011 --> 12:53.044
And you're totally innocent,
I'm sure.

12:53.079 --> 12:55.145
-Yes, I am!
-(mocking): "But I am, Ma."

12:55.180 --> 12:57.213
-Yes. I... (sighs)
-"Yes."

12:57.248 --> 12:59.380
-(Esther babbling mockingly)
-I am innocent, Ma!

12:59.415 --> 13:02.713
-(smooching)
-(Paul gagging)

13:03.925 --> 13:06.189
How was school, buster?

13:06.224 --> 13:07.322
-It was fine.
-Yeah?

13:07.357 --> 13:08.653
I have Mr. Turkeltaub.

13:08.688 --> 13:10.226
-Can you sign
a permission slip? -Hmm?

13:10.261 --> 13:12.063
We're going on a class trip
next week.

13:12.098 --> 13:14.725
-Ah.
-Into the city with my friends.

13:14.760 --> 13:19.565
Guess whose mother already
did it in my school meeting.

13:19.600 --> 13:21.072
-Ma?
-Yeah?

13:21.107 --> 13:23.173
How much power
do you have at school?

13:23.208 --> 13:26.143
Like, do you run everything
or...

13:26.178 --> 13:27.474
(snickers)

13:27.509 --> 13:28.739
(laughing)

13:28.774 --> 13:30.246
ESTHER (laughing):
No.

13:30.281 --> 13:32.919
No, I'm the president
of the PTA. Why?

13:32.954 --> 13:34.844
-Mm. Just wondering.
-Hmm.

13:34.879 --> 13:36.351
What is that?

13:36.386 --> 13:38.925
It's a type of fish.
It's very nice.

13:38.960 --> 13:40.520
It's called scrod.

13:40.555 --> 13:43.259
Well, I'm definitely
not eating scrod.

13:43.294 --> 13:45.063
Look, what does it matter
what it's called?

13:45.098 --> 13:47.197
It flakes.
That means it's fresh.

13:47.232 --> 13:48.759
-Like fresh doggy doo.
-Hey.

13:48.794 --> 13:50.200
I'll just eat the spaghetti

13:50.235 --> 13:52.763
and order dumplings
from Fan Fan for delivery.

13:53.568 --> 13:55.271
Don't you dare. Don't you dare.

13:55.306 --> 13:56.866
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

13:56.901 --> 13:58.208
I have made plenty of food.

13:58.243 --> 13:59.440
You're not ordering dumplings.

13:59.475 --> 14:01.079
We'll soon see about that.

14:01.114 --> 14:02.278
Excuse me?

14:02.313 --> 14:04.115
Hey, jelly bean, come here.

14:04.150 --> 14:06.447
Eat this.

14:06.482 --> 14:08.284
Have this.

14:08.319 --> 14:09.516
Behave yourself.

14:09.551 --> 14:11.122
Don't give your mother
a hard time.

14:11.157 --> 14:13.289
-(Paul grunts)
-Now, get out of here.

14:13.324 --> 14:14.752
Tell your brother
to behave, too.

14:14.787 --> 14:16.292
PAUL:
Okay.

14:17.130 --> 14:18.558
IRVING:
Now, I like the Throgs Neck.

14:18.593 --> 14:20.065
-I like the suspension bridge.
-(slurping)

14:20.100 --> 14:21.462
ESTHER:
Don't slurp.

14:21.497 --> 14:23.299
IRVING: The Kosciuszko Bridge
is a nice bridge.

14:23.334 --> 14:24.861
-It's a comely bridge.
-Don't slurp.

14:24.896 --> 14:28.205
For me, a truss bridge
is-is the best bridge.

14:28.240 --> 14:29.635
-ALL: A truss bridge?
-IRVING: A truss bridge.

14:29.670 --> 14:31.142
I thought that's what you wear
around your back.

14:31.177 --> 14:32.979
GRANDPA:
Here. Bloody worms.

14:33.014 --> 14:36.147
IRVING: A truss bridge of,
uh, interconnected triangles,

14:36.182 --> 14:40.217
and a triangle cannot
be distorted by stress,

14:40.252 --> 14:42.879
-so it's perfectly
load-bearing. -(Ted chuckling)

14:42.914 --> 14:44.419
LOUIS: You know, we go over
the Kosciuszko...

14:44.454 --> 14:45.750
IRVING:
What are you laughing about?

14:45.785 --> 14:47.620
Your father's making
a really good point.

14:47.655 --> 14:49.325
It's perfectly load-bearing.
It's not distorted by stress.

14:49.360 --> 14:50.491
ESTHER: I actually have
a little announcement.

14:50.526 --> 14:52.295
RUTH:
Esther would like to talk.

14:52.330 --> 14:53.593
(clears throat)

14:53.628 --> 14:56.002
I've decided
with, uh, your support

14:56.037 --> 14:58.664
that I'm gonna run
for the district school board.

14:58.699 --> 15:00.666
-GRANDMA: Oh, that's wonderful.
-(clapping)

15:00.701 --> 15:01.667
Wonderful.

15:01.702 --> 15:05.011
ESTHER:
Thank you. Okay, okay.

15:05.046 --> 15:06.606
You gonna win?

15:06.641 --> 15:09.345
With your support, yeah,
yeah, I might.

15:09.380 --> 15:11.248
(chuckles) It sounds like
you're not gonna.

15:11.283 --> 15:12.942
(Ted laughs)

15:12.977 --> 15:14.680
I said I needed your support,
not rude comments, all right?

15:14.715 --> 15:16.418
Did you hear
what he said to me?

15:16.453 --> 15:19.454
Hey, don't make yourself
objectionable for once, okay?

15:19.489 --> 15:21.423
Wipe your face. Wipe your face.

15:21.458 --> 15:23.029
GRANDMA:
Esther, dear,

15:23.064 --> 15:24.921
why would you run
for the school board

15:24.956 --> 15:26.527
with Teddy in private school?

15:26.562 --> 15:28.331
ESTHER:
For Paul's sake.

15:28.366 --> 15:29.959
And to make a difference
in the community.

15:29.994 --> 15:32.632
GRANDMA: I'm sorry, I think
that's absolutely crazy.

15:32.667 --> 15:34.766
Paulie should be
in Ted's school anyway.

15:34.801 --> 15:36.207
And we can help.

15:36.242 --> 15:37.373
-Can't we, Aaron?
-GRANDPA: Yeah, we can help.

15:37.408 --> 15:38.506
GRANDMA:
Absolutely.

15:38.541 --> 15:40.046
He's fine where he is now, Ma.

15:40.081 --> 15:41.872
GRANDMA: I'm just saying
that the public school system

15:41.907 --> 15:44.710
is just not what it was
when we taught there.

15:44.745 --> 15:45.612
Am I right?

15:45.647 --> 15:47.350
GRANDPA:
It's changed, I guess.

15:47.385 --> 15:49.451
Grandma, I like school.

15:49.486 --> 15:51.222
All my friends are there.

15:51.257 --> 15:54.159
My dear boy, you will be able
to make friends everywhere.

15:54.194 --> 15:55.556
Let me tell you something.

15:55.591 --> 15:57.558
The class sizes there
are out of control,

15:57.593 --> 15:59.659
and they are now
bringing kids in

15:59.694 --> 16:01.892
from all over
those neighborhoods.

16:01.927 --> 16:03.168
The Blacks are coming in...

16:03.203 --> 16:05.368
-Ma!
-GRANDMA: I'm sorry.

16:05.403 --> 16:07.073
Come on.
They got nowhere else to go.

16:07.108 --> 16:08.503
Their schools are broken.

16:08.538 --> 16:10.076
He should be going
to private school, Aaron.

16:10.111 --> 16:12.342
-RUTH: I don't believe this.
-GRANDMA: You know that.

16:12.377 --> 16:14.377
RUTH:
These are my kiddush cups.

16:14.412 --> 16:16.412
I brought them back
from Czechoslovakia.

16:16.447 --> 16:17.842
GRANDMA:
Congratulations.

16:17.877 --> 16:19.976
You were in Czechoslovakia,
Aunt Ruth?

16:20.011 --> 16:21.351
Yes.

16:21.386 --> 16:24.255
I worked for the Pentagon
right after the war.

16:24.290 --> 16:29.194
I was relocating
displaced persons in Prague.

16:29.229 --> 16:30.921
TED:
That's so cool.

16:30.956 --> 16:33.099
Your great-aunt is
a very impressive person.

16:33.134 --> 16:35.431
I went into this
thrift store there,

16:35.466 --> 16:37.565
and I saw all these
kiddush cups.

16:37.600 --> 16:40.337
Then I looked at
the bottom of the cups,

16:40.372 --> 16:43.109
-and I saw all these names.
-Wow.

16:43.144 --> 16:45.606
I knew they were stolen
from Jews

16:45.641 --> 16:47.410
that went to the camps.

16:47.445 --> 16:49.445
-I almost fell over.
-(coughing)

16:49.480 --> 16:50.908
(Irving gags)

16:50.943 --> 16:53.944
(gasping, gagging)

16:53.979 --> 16:55.781
(Paul and Ted laughing)

16:55.816 --> 16:57.981
RUTH:
What are you laughing at?

16:58.984 --> 17:00.522
How can you laugh at that?

17:00.557 --> 17:02.128
What are you laughing at?

17:02.163 --> 17:03.525
RUTH:
How can you kids...

17:03.560 --> 17:05.560
The Nazis took 'em
to the camps.

17:05.595 --> 17:08.057
Esther, they're laughing
about Nazis.

17:08.092 --> 17:10.136
-Irving.
-RUTH: That's not funny.

17:10.171 --> 17:11.797
-IRVING: Behave.
-RUTH: What are you...

17:11.832 --> 17:13.403
-What are you laughing at?
-Behave!

17:13.438 --> 17:15.141
-ESTHER: Aah! Irving.
-RUTH: That's not funny.

17:15.176 --> 17:17.143
-That's all. Eat the meat.
-ESTHER: No, no, no, no, no.

17:17.178 --> 17:19.145
-I don't want to hear
any reasons. -IRVING: Here.

17:19.180 --> 17:21.708
ESTHER: There's no excuse
for that. I'm so sorry.

17:21.743 --> 17:23.248
You're gonna catch
your father's temper.

17:23.283 --> 17:24.909
GRANDPA:
It's not funny.

17:24.944 --> 17:27.384
I can't see why we just don't
have dumplings every night.

17:27.419 --> 17:29.287
This is disgusting.

17:29.322 --> 17:30.717
ESTHER:
It's not disgusting.

17:30.752 --> 17:32.719
And we can't have dumplings
every night,

17:32.754 --> 17:34.160
because then we'd never have

17:34.195 --> 17:35.656
a single dollar
for anything else.

17:35.691 --> 17:37.460
-IRVING: Eat it.
-You know what I teach, buddy?

17:37.495 --> 17:38.659
I teach home economics.

17:38.694 --> 17:39.924
All right?
You know what that means?

17:39.959 --> 17:41.431
It means I teach
how to stay on a budget.

17:41.466 --> 17:42.663
-All right?
-IRVING: What did I say?

17:42.698 --> 17:44.060
-ESTHER: He has no idea.
-IRVING: Eat it.

17:44.095 --> 17:45.435
ESTHER: He has no idea
the meaning of a dollar.

17:45.470 --> 17:46.733
He has no idea
how hard we work.

17:46.768 --> 17:47.800
He just...
he does not get it at all.

17:47.835 --> 17:49.604
(mock babbling)

17:49.639 --> 17:51.573
Hey, stop that. No, no.

17:51.608 --> 17:53.905
(sighs) Dumplings, suckers.

17:53.940 --> 17:57.150
ESTHER: Paul, what are you...
Don't you dare.

17:57.185 --> 17:58.811
Paul, don't you dare.

17:58.846 --> 18:00.351
-Paul, what are you doing?
-Hey.

18:00.386 --> 18:01.583
Hey, get me some fried.

18:01.618 --> 18:03.255
No. What, now you
don't like dinner?

18:03.290 --> 18:05.455
-TED: It's got all this water
in it, Ma. -No, it doesn't.

18:05.490 --> 18:07.017
TED: It's slipping
and sliding on the plate. Look.

18:07.052 --> 18:09.690
ESTHER: No, it doesn't!
It's just like Antonio's.

18:09.725 --> 18:11.021
-TED: It's not.
-ESTHER: Paul?

18:11.056 --> 18:12.660
Paul, don't you dial
that num... Irving.

18:12.695 --> 18:14.024
IRVING:
Hang up the phone right now.

18:14.059 --> 18:15.927
No ching chang cho food
tonight, okay?

18:15.962 --> 18:17.632
-ESTHER: Paul? -You stop!
Your mother made dinner.

18:17.667 --> 18:19.029
ESTHER: I am not joking
right now, okay?

18:19.064 --> 18:20.470

-Hey, Grandpa?
-What?

20:14.355 --> 20:17.884
Today, when you said
the spaghetti was bloody worms,

20:17.919 --> 20:20.326
-what did you mean?
-Oh, that.

20:20.361 --> 20:24.154
Well, my mother, you know,
when we came over here,

20:24.189 --> 20:28.059
uh, to America,
through Ellis Island,

20:28.094 --> 20:31.502
uh, they served spaghetti there
on Ellis Island.

20:31.537 --> 20:33.669
And my mother thought
it was, uh, worms.

20:33.704 --> 20:37.167
She said, "Ach, they just...
worms, bloody worms."

20:37.202 --> 20:40.577
So she wouldn't have it
in the house.

20:40.612 --> 20:42.513
Yeah, I could see that.

20:42.548 --> 20:45.175
But then why'd she come here?

20:47.212 --> 20:50.015
'Cause they wanted to kill her.
That's why.

20:50.985 --> 20:52.820
Who would?

20:53.559 --> 20:55.988
Uh...

20:56.023 --> 20:59.431
she was born and raised
in a small town

20:59.466 --> 21:02.159
called Ostropil
in, uh, the Ukraine.

21:02.194 --> 21:04.799
And her parents had a store
there in the main street.

21:04.834 --> 21:07.032
It was a shop, and, uh...

21:07.067 --> 21:08.869
But there were troops
of soldiers

21:08.904 --> 21:10.706
in the garrison who were drunk

21:10.741 --> 21:15.040
and Cossacks who were crazy,
always were.

21:15.075 --> 21:17.108
And sometimes they'd go out
looking for Jews.

21:17.143 --> 21:20.012
They'd say,
"We're looking for the Jews."

21:21.180 --> 21:24.555
And one night,
they rode into the town,

21:24.590 --> 21:27.855
and, um, they broke into
her parents' store,

21:27.890 --> 21:31.364
and, uh, they stabbed
both of them for no reason.

21:32.400 --> 21:34.158
They stabbed both of them
to death right there

21:34.193 --> 21:36.567
in front of my mama, and, uh...
(scoffs)

21:36.602 --> 21:38.327
She was a young girl.
She was 15, 16.

21:38.362 --> 21:41.407
She told me she had nightmares
about it as long as she lived.

21:42.410 --> 21:44.839
She said you should never,
ever forget the past

21:44.874 --> 21:47.413
because you never know when
they may come looking for you.

21:47.448 --> 21:51.417
And she... she was right.

21:51.452 --> 21:53.012
Yeah.

21:53.047 --> 21:54.915
But she survived. She got away.

21:54.950 --> 21:56.851
She got out.
She left her country.

21:56.886 --> 21:59.986
She left the Ukraine,
and she was unstoppable.

22:00.021 --> 22:02.527
She got through Poland
and Denmark, I think,

22:02.562 --> 22:04.056
and then to Liverpool.

22:04.091 --> 22:07.862
(chuckles) That's where
The Beatles are from.

22:09.437 --> 22:11.294
The Beatles.

22:12.473 --> 22:15.199
Anyway, she met, uh,
my father then,

22:15.234 --> 22:18.906
and they got married
and they had me, and, uh...

22:18.941 --> 22:21.238
So she said,
"Okay, come on, let's go."

22:21.273 --> 22:24.780
And we got on the boat and we
came over here to America.

<i> by Kandinsky.</i>

37:36.319 --> 37:41.190
So, today, we're gonna try
our very own art project.

37:41.225 --> 37:44.369
Right? So, you find a word,

37:44.404 --> 37:46.371
a word that is a noun.

37:46.406 --> 37:47.801
You all know what a noun is.

37:47.836 --> 37:49.968
STUDENTS:
A person, place or a thing.

37:50.003 --> 37:52.135
-BOY: That ends in...
-GIRL: That ends in L-Y.

37:52.170 --> 37:53.378
No, no, no. (chuckles)

37:53.413 --> 37:55.677
No L-Y. That's an adverb.

37:55.712 --> 37:57.877
So, you take a word
that is a noun...

37:57.912 --> 37:59.879
(voice fading):
and you write it out in letters

37:59.914 --> 38:02.211
made up of that exact thing.

38:02.246 --> 38:04.312
So I want you to...

38:04.347 --> 38:06.182
(laughter)

38:06.217 --> 38:08.217
-For example, books.
-Oh, my God. -Look at Johnny.

38:08.252 --> 38:11.825
Books, Mr. Davis, something
you don't know anything about.

38:12.597 --> 38:14.289
Fuck you, Turkey.

38:14.324 --> 38:16.027
-(students gasp)
-Get up.

38:16.062 --> 38:17.325
Get over there.

38:17.360 --> 38:18.568
Go on. Go, go, go.

38:18.603 --> 38:20.372
You are not doing this project.

38:20.407 --> 38:21.538
You're just gonna sit there!

38:21.573 --> 38:23.067
Fine by me.

38:23.102 --> 38:26.774
MR. TURKELTAUB: You're just
gonna sit right there.

38:32.210 --> 38:36.146
Now, all the paper should be
covered with a color.

38:36.181 --> 38:38.918
All right?
And use your imaginations.

38:38.953 --> 38:40.854
And be...

38:40.889 --> 38:43.362
-original.
-STUDENTS: Original.

38:47.467 --> 38:50.633
MR. TURKELTAUB: Color
the drawings, not the desk.

39:00.304 --> 39:02.414
(Mr. Turkeltaub clears throat)

39:03.406 --> 39:05.076
What's this?

39:06.816 --> 39:09.982
Uh, it's a Kandinsky.

39:11.117 --> 39:12.787
Stand up.

39:14.417 --> 39:16.428
All right. (sighs)

39:17.761 --> 39:20.729
Class, we went to the museum.

39:20.764 --> 39:23.292
Who saw paintings like this?

39:23.327 --> 39:25.393
I remember. That's a copy.

39:25.428 --> 39:27.296
MR. TURKELTAUB:
Now, what did I say to you,

39:27.331 --> 39:29.573
Mr. Graff, about doing
your own work here?

39:29.608 --> 39:31.069
Look, this is a copy.

39:31.104 --> 39:33.302
And it's not the assignment,
so you weren't listening.

39:33.337 --> 39:36.173
-The drawing's excellent, man.
-(students gasp)

39:37.517 --> 39:39.484
Mr. Davis, I didn't ask you.

39:39.519 --> 39:40.914
That's 'cause you're
a goddamn turkey

39:40.949 --> 39:42.817
-and I'll fuck you up!
-(students gasping)

39:42.852 --> 39:44.819
MR. TURKELTAUB: All right.
That's it! That's it! Right...

39:44.854 --> 39:47.118
Right to Mr. Sebell's
right now!

39:47.153 --> 39:49.890
-(students murmuring)
-(door opens)

39:49.925 --> 39:51.859
(door bangs shut)

39:52.697 --> 39:56.567
MR. TURKELTAUB:
These are Cuisenaire rods.

39:56.602 --> 39:58.360
Okay?

39:59.836 --> 40:03.002
Okay, so now you put
the green rod

40:03.037 --> 40:07.336
on the number six row
with the "A" column.

40:07.371 --> 40:10.581
Okay? Green rod, number six row.

40:10.616 --> 40:13.452
I need a piece of graph paper.

40:14.554 --> 40:16.587
Forget it.
You're too far behind now.

40:16.622 --> 40:20.184
You can either sit quietly
or clean up the paintbrushes.

40:20.219 --> 40:21.955
Up to you.

40:25.059 --> 40:26.289
Oh.

40:26.324 --> 40:28.863
Good, Mr. Davis,
helping out for a change.

40:29.833 --> 40:32.801
All right, who'd like to go on
cleanup duty and, uh, help out?

40:32.836 --> 40:35.067
Who'd like to volunteer?

40:35.971 --> 40:37.707
Oh, look, his buddy Paul.

40:37.742 --> 40:39.511
Don't take too long.

40:39.546 --> 40:41.172
-Now...
-PAUL:<i> Hey.</i>

40:41.207 --> 40:43.438
-Thanks for sticking up for me.
-Yeah, man.

40:43.473 --> 40:45.682
How'd it go with you?
Did you get in trouble?

40:45.717 --> 40:47.211
No. I was down there
for a while,

40:47.246 --> 40:48.817
and nobody even
come talk to me.

40:48.852 --> 40:50.445
-Huh.
-Not the whole time.

40:50.480 --> 40:51.886
So I just come back up.

40:51.921 --> 40:54.350
-Wow.
-Check this out.

40:55.925 --> 40:57.562
What is that?

40:57.597 --> 40:58.860
My cousin gave it to me.

40:58.895 --> 41:00.224
He said you smoke 'em,

41:00.259 --> 41:02.160
you just, like,
laugh and laugh.

41:02.195 --> 41:03.568
(both chuckle)

41:03.603 --> 41:05.394
So, you gonna do it?

41:05.429 --> 41:07.066
-Like, now?
-Yeah, man.

41:07.101 --> 41:10.201
Suck it in.
It's made of tea and shit.

41:12.370 --> 41:13.842
(whispers):
In here.

41:19.344 --> 41:20.849
(lighter flicking)

41:20.884 --> 41:23.148
Let's boldly go
where no man's gone before.

41:23.183 --> 41:25.117
(both laugh)

41:27.594 --> 41:29.319
(coughing)

41:29.354 --> 41:30.694
Try it, man.

41:30.729 --> 41:32.520
Hold it in.

41:32.555 --> 41:35.292
(both coughing)

41:38.264 --> 41:40.297
(both laughing)

41:41.608 --> 41:43.806
(chatter nearby)

41:45.073 --> 41:47.271
He went... he went... (yelps)

41:47.306 --> 41:49.614
(laughing continues)

41:49.649 --> 41:51.913
(Johnny coughing)

41:54.148 --> 41:55.345
-How dare you!
-Shit.

41:55.380 --> 41:57.622
You're a menace!
A menace, the two of you!

41:57.657 --> 42:00.152
That's unbelievable!
Go! Get out!

42:03.322 --> 42:05.124
PRINCIPAL SEBELL:
Paul, do you know

42:05.159 --> 42:07.423
what was in that cigarette?

42:09.097 --> 42:11.064
Young man, what you
were smoking is illegal,

42:11.099 --> 42:12.604
and you could go to jail.

42:12.639 --> 42:15.002
Now, is that what you want?

42:18.678 --> 42:20.337
Would you please answer him?

42:22.814 --> 42:25.947
No, obviously not.

42:25.982 --> 42:28.246
ESTHER:
Principal Sebell.

42:32.186 --> 42:34.923
I can promise you he had
no idea what he was doing.

42:34.958 --> 42:36.661
We don't have anything
like that in our house,

42:36.696 --> 42:39.422
and, uh, he wasn't the one
who brought it into the school.

42:39.457 --> 42:40.863
And...

42:42.361 --> 42:45.098
I think it's incumbent
upon the school

42:45.133 --> 42:47.397
not only to look
at class size--

42:47.432 --> 42:49.564
take a good, long look
at class size--

42:49.599 --> 42:51.533
but also who is in what class.

42:52.503 --> 42:54.338
Mrs. Graff...

42:54.373 --> 42:57.341
I know you're thinking about
running for the district board,

42:57.376 --> 43:02.049
but have you ever thought about
remedial classes for Paul?

43:03.855 --> 43:05.789
ESTHER:
Remedial?

43:05.824 --> 43:07.285
PRINCIPAL SEBELL:
Yes.

43:07.320 --> 43:09.925
It might be an option
for you and your family

43:09.960 --> 43:12.191
moving forward, because...

43:12.226 --> 43:14.556
he may be a bit slow.

43:19.002 --> 43:22.201
My son is not slow.

43:22.236 --> 43:23.840
No, sir.

43:23.875 --> 43:25.171
PRINCIPAL SEBELL:
Mrs. Graff...

43:25.206 --> 43:27.338
ESTHER:
No, I've heard enough.

43:28.077 --> 43:29.571
Get up. Time to go.

43:33.885 --> 43:36.149
(muffled, indistinct chatter)

43:37.757 --> 43:40.087
(door opens)

43:45.996 --> 43:48.194
(distorted laughing)

43:49.098 --> 43:51.527
-(door bangs shut)
-(snapping fingers)

43:53.168 --> 43:55.069
What were you thinking?!

43:55.104 --> 43:56.301
How could you do that?

43:56.336 --> 43:57.973
-Huh?
-(sighs): Oh, my God.

43:58.008 --> 43:59.909
How am I supposed to know
it's against the law, Ma?

43:59.944 --> 44:02.307
-Oh, my God.
-Besides, it's fine.

44:02.342 --> 44:03.979
You're the president
of the school.

44:04.014 --> 44:06.146
No, I'm not. I am in the PTA,
for God's sa...

44:06.181 --> 44:08.181
I don't even think
I can run for the board

44:08.216 --> 44:09.853
or anything else
after this little episode.

44:09.888 --> 44:11.756
Thank you.

44:11.791 --> 44:13.186
Okey doke.

44:13.221 --> 44:15.254
No, it's not okey doke.
Okey dokey?

44:15.289 --> 44:16.926
This is not
a respectful response.

44:16.961 --> 44:18.686
-Where did you learn
this disrespect? -Stop.

44:18.721 --> 44:20.622
-Ow!
-What?!

44:25.970 --> 44:28.267
Where did you get
that cigarette?

44:29.633 --> 44:31.006
Hmm?

44:31.041 --> 44:32.777
Did that Black boy
that was sitting there...

44:32.812 --> 44:34.570
did he give it to you?

44:34.605 --> 44:36.913
Well, you're not to associate
with him again.

44:36.948 --> 44:38.607
What do you mean? Why?

44:38.642 --> 44:40.081
I think you know what I mean.

44:40.116 --> 44:41.753
-You mean 'cause he's Black?
-S-Stop it.

44:41.788 --> 44:44.481
-I hung out with him last year,
too, if you care. -Stop it.

44:45.484 --> 44:46.725
(mouthing)

44:47.651 --> 44:49.090
It's not 'cause he's Black.

44:49.125 --> 44:51.026
All right, he could be
green or purple

44:51.061 --> 44:52.522
or orange, for all I care.

44:52.557 --> 44:56.625
The principal said
that he was held back.

44:56.660 --> 44:58.396
So?

44:58.431 --> 44:59.870
(Esther sighs)

44:59.905 --> 45:01.201
That means
he's not very bright.

45:01.236 --> 45:02.939
-No, it doesn't.
-Yes, it does.

45:02.974 --> 45:04.534
-He's super smart and really...
-(stammers) I can't with you.

45:04.569 --> 45:06.272
-You just don't know him.
-I can't...

45:06.307 --> 45:07.977
-Your father's gonna have to
deal with you. -What?

45:08.012 --> 45:09.814
Your father's gonna
have to deal with you.

45:09.849 --> 45:11.816
Why? What's he gonna do?

45:11.851 --> 45:13.279
Guess, genius.

45:13.314 --> 45:15.083
I'm done sticking up for you.

45:15.118 --> 45:16.821
Ma? Ma, wait.

45:16.856 --> 45:18.449
(thunder rumbling)

45:18.484 --> 45:20.583
Ma! Ma!

45:22.686 --> 45:24.653
ESTHER:
Irving? Irving?

45:24.688 --> 45:26.996
-Please don't.
-I need to talk to you.

45:27.031 --> 45:28.800
IRVING:
What?

45:35.534 --> 45:37.336
(lock clicking)

45:44.015 --> 45:45.740
(panting)

45:45.775 --> 45:48.215
(Esther and Irving shouting
indistinctly in distance)

45:59.899 --> 46:02.130
(footsteps rapidly approaching)

46:03.628 --> 46:05.100
(doorknob rattling)

46:05.135 --> 46:06.805
IRVING:
Open the door.

46:08.072 --> 46:09.632
I can't.

46:09.667 --> 46:11.172
Paul...

46:11.207 --> 46:13.471
(door rattling)

46:13.506 --> 46:14.945
Open the door.

46:14.980 --> 46:17.211
-You'll hit me, Dad.
-Open it up!

46:17.246 --> 46:18.674
I'm not doing it.

46:18.709 --> 46:21.050
Your mother just said
you and some Black kid

46:21.085 --> 46:22.777
were smoking drugs in school?

46:22.812 --> 46:24.812
-I didn't know what it was.
-(door banging)

46:24.847 --> 46:28.453
IRVING:
Open the goddamn door!

46:28.488 --> 46:29.894
(crying)

46:29.929 --> 46:31.654
Please.

46:31.689 --> 46:33.392
You're gonna get it, kid.

46:33.427 --> 46:35.460
You are gonna get it.

46:35.495 --> 46:37.902
-(Paul yells)
-Come here!

46:37.937 --> 46:39.134
Stop!

46:39.169 --> 46:40.971
-(Irving grunts)
-(sobs)

46:41.006 --> 46:43.171
Stop! Please stop.

46:43.206 --> 46:45.140
-The hell is the matter
with you? -Please!

46:45.175 --> 46:47.439
-(sobbing)
-Get up!

46:48.442 --> 46:50.409
Please.

46:50.444 --> 46:52.840
S-Stop.

46:52.875 --> 46:54.545
Please stop.

46:54.580 --> 46:56.481
(coughs)

46:56.516 --> 46:58.054
(whimpers)

46:58.089 --> 47:00.749
(sobbing softly)

47:04.931 --> 47:06.854
That's enough. Stop crying.

47:06.889 --> 47:09.131
Stop blubbering.

47:11.135 --> 47:12.937
The hell are you laughing at?!

47:12.972 --> 47:14.268
There's not a single
goddamn thing

47:14.303 --> 47:15.764
that's amusing about this.

47:15.799 --> 47:17.634
Get out of here, you asshole!

47:21.112 --> 47:23.211
IRVING:
Get cleaned up for dinner.

47:23.246 --> 47:26.280
And-and wash your teeth after
with the Waterpik.

47:26.315 --> 47:28.777
Your breath
is like trench mouth.

47:30.088 --> 47:31.615
I hate you.

47:31.650 --> 47:33.485
I hate this family.

47:36.160 --> 47:37.786
What did you say?

47:38.789 --> 47:40.228
Nothing.

47:40.263 --> 47:42.263
-What did you say to me?
-Nothing.

47:42.298 --> 47:43.935
What did you say to me?

47:43.970 --> 47:45.563
I said nothing. (yells)

47:45.598 --> 47:47.796
-What did you say?!
-Nothing!

47:47.831 --> 47:49.699
What did you say to me?!

47:49.734 --> 47:50.799
Nothing!

47:50.834 --> 47:52.108
-Huh?
-Nothing.

47:52.143 --> 47:53.472
IRVING:
What did you say to me?!

47:53.507 --> 47:55.947
-(thumping)
-PAUL: Aah! Nothing.

47:55.982 --> 47:58.180
Nothing. I promise.

47:58.985 --> 48:01.513
(whimpers, coughs)

48:05.354 --> 48:07.992
You made me break
the goddamn door.

48:08.027 --> 48:10.291
(panting)

48:11.195 --> 48:13.459
(crying softly)

48:17.432 --> 48:19.168
Someday he'll learn he's not

48:19.203 --> 48:21.797
the smartest kid
on planet Earth.

48:22.833 --> 48:25.438
ESTHER: I've had it
with that school, Irving.

48:25.473 --> 48:27.869
He needs a place
with real discipline.

48:29.213 --> 48:31.906

52:00.424 --> 52:02.556
Okay.

52:04.758 --> 52:07.022
I told your parents to do that.

52:09.367 --> 52:10.795
You did?

52:10.830 --> 52:12.236
Yes, I did.

52:12.271 --> 52:14.535
Because the game is rigged,

52:14.570 --> 52:17.340
and we want to take care

52:23.711 --> 52:25.678
for the first time
in your life.

52:25.713 --> 52:27.977
Because what he's saying
is important.

52:28.012 --> 52:29.814
-Just listen to Grandpa.
-GRANDPA: Listen to me.

52:29.849 --> 52:31.750
When I was young,
I was a very good student,

52:31.785 --> 52:33.587
but my name was Rabinowitz.

52:33.622 --> 52:37.558
And, um,
in college after college,

52:37.593 --> 52:39.054
during the interviews,
those people,

52:39.089 --> 52:41.155
whoever the hell they were,
they would look at me,

52:41.190 --> 52:43.597
they'd smile at me,
look at me up and down, eh,

52:43.632 --> 52:45.731
like I was some kind of freak
in the circus,

52:45.766 --> 52:48.272
and then they'd say
with a big smile,

52:48.307 --> 52:50.065
"Oh, thank you. And sorry,

52:50.100 --> 52:52.243
"but we don't need any more
Spinowitzes this year.

-Do you get my meaning?

53:01.551 --> 53:03.287
IRVING:
You know what he's telling you?

53:03.322 --> 53:04.585
Do you know what that means?

53:04.620 --> 53:06.290
"We have enough
Spinowitzes here"?

53:06.325 --> 53:08.721
N-No.

53:08.756 --> 53:10.426
It means they don't want
any more Jews.

53:10.461 --> 53:11.889
That's right.
They hated us then,

53:11.924 --> 53:13.858
they didn't want us,
and they still hate us.

53:13.893 --> 53:15.728
And screw 'em. I don't care.

53:15.763 --> 53:17.763
But that's why
I'm doing this for you.

53:17.798 --> 53:19.897
Now, your name is Graff.
That's a better name.

53:19.932 --> 53:21.602
You can blend in, and why not?

53:21.637 --> 53:23.065
And, uh,
this new school could, uh,

53:23.100 --> 53:25.705
introduce you to
a whole new group of friends.

53:25.740 --> 53:28.070
And, uh, you can go to
the college you want to go to.

53:28.105 --> 53:29.379
Okay?

53:29.414 --> 53:30.644
I know, but college
doesn't matter

53:30.679 --> 53:31.975
if you want to be an artist.

53:32.010 --> 53:33.350

Uh, you're going to college.

53:34.353 --> 53:37.145

an artist if you want to be.

53:37.180 --> 53:38.751
Nothing's gonna stop you.

53:38.786 --> 53:40.148

53:47.531 --> 53:48.827

something else.

your father's family

53:50.633 --> 53:51.995

53:52.030 --> 53:54.470
you know, we, uh...
we came to this country

53:54.505 --> 53:56.736
and, um, we didn't have much.

53:56.771 --> 53:58.804
We didn't have
the good fortune.

53:58.839 --> 54:01.510
But we saved-- your grandmother
and I, we saved--

54:01.545 --> 54:03.237
and now we can help
your parents.

54:03.272 --> 54:05.613

the entire school community

58:32.915 --> 58:35.377
about how proud we are
to have one of our own

58:35.412 --> 58:38.281
come visit all of us
for assembly today.

58:39.086 --> 58:41.053
But before we hear
from our guest,

58:41.088 --> 58:43.022
a special thanks to her father,

58:43.057 --> 58:46.762
who is leading the fundraising
drive for our new library.

58:46.797 --> 58:50.392
The Trump family is our family.

58:50.427 --> 58:53.296
So, Fred, please stand up,
would you?

58:53.331 --> 58:55.331
(applause)

58:58.336 --> 59:01.337
-(cheering)
-Fred Trump, everyone.

59:02.681 --> 59:05.242
Now, we have an election
coming up.

59:05.277 --> 59:07.211
-STUDENTS: Reagan! Reagan!
-(chuckles)

59:07.246 --> 59:11.248
(more students joining in):
Reagan! Reagan! Reagan! Reagan!

59:11.283 --> 59:14.724
-Reagan! Reagan!
-No, no, no.

59:14.759 --> 59:18.090
I'm talking about
our student elections.

59:18.125 --> 59:21.258
I would encourage
each and every one of you

59:21.293 --> 59:25.361
who is thinking of running
to listen today, hmm?

59:26.705 --> 59:29.167
And with that, please welcome

59:29.202 --> 59:31.840
United States Attorney
Maryanne Trump.

59:31.875 --> 59:33.336
Maryanne?

59:33.371 --> 59:35.437
(cheering)

59:41.610 --> 59:44.655
MARYANNE: Thank you so much,
Headmaster Fitzroy.

59:44.690 --> 59:47.119
And thank you, Father.

59:48.023 --> 59:51.057
Today, I'm not here
to give you the same old talk.

59:52.291 --> 59:55.226
Today, I'm gonna
give it to you straight.

59:56.064 --> 59:59.263
You're gonna want to go
to a good college.

59:59.298 --> 1:00:02.233
You're gonna want to succeed.

1:00:03.071 --> 1:00:05.104
But you're not going to.

1:00:05.139 --> 1:00:07.403
Hmm-mm. That's right.

1:00:08.505 --> 1:00:11.209
Unless...

1:00:11.244 --> 1:00:13.640
unless you follow the example

1:00:13.675 --> 1:00:16.115
that I'm gonna set forth
for you.

1:00:16.150 --> 1:00:19.415
You may be saying to yourself,
"What does she know?"

1:00:20.726 --> 1:00:22.220
Well, when I came here,

1:00:22.255 --> 1:00:27.390
no one handed me
anything for free.

1:00:27.425 --> 1:00:28.457
How did I succeed?

1:00:28.492 --> 1:00:32.164
By good old-fashioned
hard work.

1:00:32.199 --> 1:00:34.298
And that's how
you're gonna make it.

1:00:34.333 --> 1:00:37.939
I knew there was no free lunch.

1:00:39.668 --> 1:00:42.977
Through college, law school,

1:00:43.012 --> 1:00:46.079
the U.S. Attorneys Office,

1:00:46.114 --> 1:00:50.083
I was a woman
in a man's business.

1:00:50.118 --> 1:00:53.922
But I kept on fighting.

1:00:53.957 --> 1:00:55.583
That's right, girls.

1:00:55.618 --> 1:00:57.222
I'm talking to you, too.

1:00:57.257 --> 1:01:00.324
Mm-hmm. You can be anything
you want to be in this,

1:01:00.359 --> 1:01:03.459
the greatest country
in the world.

1:01:04.627 --> 1:01:08.068
You people in this institution

1:01:08.103 --> 1:01:10.532
are gonna wind up on top.

1:01:11.876 --> 1:01:15.537
And you'll know,
at the end of the day,

1:01:15.572 --> 1:01:18.507
it won't be
because of a handout.

1:01:18.542 --> 1:01:20.443
Right?

1:01:20.478 --> 1:01:24.546

you earned your way there.

I wanted to tell you.

1:11:00.728 --> 1:11:03.190
I'm gonna have to go away

1:11:03.225 --> 1:11:06.336
Uh, on a trip. Um...

1:11:06.371 --> 1:11:07.799
-Uh, hope...
-A trip?

1:11:07.834 --> 1:11:09.504

I have to go check out
some things.

1:11:15.479 --> 1:11:18.139
And I wanted to tell you myself
so that you're not wondering

1:11:18.174 --> 1:11:21.043

you don't see me around, okay?

1:11:21.078 --> 1:11:23.177

1:11:33.255 --> 1:11:36.058

1:11:49.238 --> 1:11:50.941
Mm...

1:11:51.779 --> 1:11:54.747

What is it?

1:11:56.883 --> 1:11:59.719
Sometimes kids say stuff.

I can't hear you.

1:12:12.899 --> 1:12:16.670

about other kids.

1:12:16.705 --> 1:12:18.265
Like what?

1:12:18.300 --> 1:12:22.445
Well, they'll say bad words
about the Black kids.

1:12:22.480 --> 1:12:24.810

1:12:26.484 --> 1:12:28.616

And, uh...

1:12:31.082 --> 1:12:33.390
what do you do
when that happens?

1:12:35.152 --> 1:12:36.723
Come on, tell me.

1:12:36.758 --> 1:12:38.593
Obviously nothing, of course.

1:12:38.628 --> 1:12:40.254
"Nothing, of course." Yeah.

You think that's smart?

1:12:42.665 --> 1:12:44.027
Well, I'll tell you
what I think.

1:12:44.062 --> 1:12:46.733
I think that's a crock
of old horseshit.

1:12:46.768 --> 1:12:47.965

1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:49.736
You got a problem with that?
Tough.

1:12:49.771 --> 1:12:51.804
I'm gonna tell you.
Now, you got to do something.

1:12:51.839 --> 1:12:54.136
You got to say something, okay?

1:12:54.171 --> 1:12:56.479
Do you know why?
'Cause you're on the ball.

1:12:56.514 --> 1:12:57.810
Right? Come on, man.

1:12:57.845 --> 1:12:59.548

than that.

will then say the same stuff
behind your back.

1:13:10.858 --> 1:13:12.759
And they'll shove a knife
straight in your gut.

1:13:12.794 --> 1:13:14.497

MS. MOUSTAKAS (faint, echoing):
And each time we try

1:23:27.705 --> 1:23:29.705
to draw ourselves,
we are drawing

1:23:29.740 --> 1:23:34.380

but who we are inside.

1:23:34.415 --> 1:23:36.745

1:23:36.780 --> 1:23:38.780
(normal): If you need
any inspiration on essence,

1:23:38.815 --> 1:23:40.848
you can see the essence
of Paul Gauguin

1:23:40.883 --> 1:23:42.883
in this self-portrait.

1:23:42.918 --> 1:23:47.129

uses to express himself, right?

1:23:47.164 --> 1:23:49.890
Blues, oranges, pinks.

1:23:49.925 --> 1:23:51.727
