00:01.835 --> 00:05.073
*

00:09.110 --> 00:11.679
>> DUDE: Uh, hey, are you using

00:11.712 --> 00:12.680
these chair...?

00:12.713 --> 00:15.216
>> LINDSAY: Back off!

00:15.249 --> 00:17.718
(scooches chair)

00:17.751 --> 00:18.719
>> GRETCHEN: Sunday Funday!

00:18.752 --> 00:19.887
>> LINDSAY: Sunday Funday!

00:19.920 --> 00:21.189
(Gretchen laughs)

00:21.222 --> 00:22.223
(both grunt)

00:22.256 --> 00:23.224
>> LINDSAY: Where have you been?

00:23.257 --> 00:24.992
I've had to fight off wave after

00:25.025 --> 00:26.694
wave of hungry, cool dads and

00:26.727 --> 00:27.595
trust-fund alts.

00:27.628 --> 00:29.163
It's been like a hipster Game of

00:29.197 --> 00:30.998
Thrones up in this bitch.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.166
>> GRETCHEN: Sorry, Ty drove me.

00:32.200 --> 00:33.767
>> LINDSAY: You banged Ty last

00:33.801 --> 00:34.502
night?

00:34.535 --> 00:35.436
>> GRETCHEN: Worse... he came

00:35.469 --> 00:36.870
over this morning to invite me

00:36.904 --> 00:38.272
to the Tribeca Film Festival.

00:38.306 --> 00:39.673
We'd leave tonight on a private

00:39.707 --> 00:40.441
plane.

00:40.474 --> 00:41.775
>> LINDSAY (gasps): Gretch...

00:41.809 --> 00:44.878
Tribeca is super hip.

00:44.912 --> 00:47.014
It, like, stands for something.

00:47.047 --> 00:47.881
>> GRETCHEN: The triangle below

00:47.915 --> 00:48.882
Canal.

00:48.916 --> 00:50.084
>> LINDSAY: No. Something real.

00:50.118 --> 00:51.619
I'll think of it later.

00:51.652 --> 00:52.386
Private plane...!

00:52.420 --> 00:53.554
>> GRETCHEN (singsongy): Private

00:53.587 --> 00:54.255
plane...!

00:54.288 --> 00:55.123
>> LINDSAY (singsongy): Dicks on

00:55.156 --> 00:56.390
a private plane...

00:56.424 --> 00:57.358
>> GRETCHEN: But Jimmy...

00:57.391 --> 00:58.626
>> LINDSAY: Gretchen.

00:58.659 --> 00:59.860
Ty is famous.

00:59.893 --> 01:01.962
Also, he's a total dog, so he's

01:01.995 --> 01:03.030
never gonna want you to meet his

01:03.063 --> 01:04.565
gross Polish parents or tell you

01:04.598 --> 01:06.200
about his squash games or ask

01:06.234 --> 01:07.568
you to shave his butthole.

01:07.601 --> 01:08.902
>> GRETCHEN: Tell me you don't

01:08.936 --> 01:10.271
shave Paul's butthole.

01:10.304 --> 01:11.639
>> LINDSAY: Marriage is dark,

01:11.672 --> 01:12.573
Gretch.

01:12.606 --> 01:13.874
>> GRETCHEN: I want to go, but

01:13.907 --> 01:15.309
not even really, because of Ty.

01:15.343 --> 01:16.277
>> LINDSAY: Right.

01:16.310 --> 01:18.045
Private plane, free champagne.

01:18.078 --> 01:19.113
>> GRETCHEN: No, here's what's

01:19.147 --> 01:20.548
keeping me up all night:

01:20.581 --> 01:22.250
Even though Jimmy's a squirrelly

01:22.283 --> 01:23.417
guy, when I look at him, I

01:23.451 --> 01:24.818
swear I can see years into the

01:24.852 --> 01:26.420
future with this dude.

01:26.454 --> 01:28.422
And th is why I am thinking of

01:28.456 --> 01:29.957
getting on that plane.

01:29.990 --> 01:31.225
>> LINDSAY: Geez...

01:31.259 --> 01:32.593
What are you going to do?

01:32.626 --> 01:35.095
>> GRETCHEN: I'm gonna have the

01:35.129 --> 01:36.264
best goddamn Sunday Funday ever

01:36.297 --> 01:37.431
and figure it out later.

01:37.465 --> 01:38.466
>> LINDSAY: Figure it out later,

01:38.499 --> 01:40.601
dicks on a plane, Sunday Funday.

01:40.634 --> 01:41.569
>> GRETCHEN: Sunday Funday!

01:41.602 --> 01:42.770
>> EDGAR: Sunday Funday,

01:42.803 --> 01:43.737
biznitches!

01:43.771 --> 01:45.273
(women laughing)

01:45.306 --> 01:46.307
>> LINDSAY, EDGAR, GRETCHEN:

01:46.340 --> 01:47.241
* Sunday Funday

01:47.275 --> 01:48.942
Better than a Monday

01:48.976 --> 01:50.344
Can only do it one way

01:50.378 --> 01:51.912
* And that is the drunk way

01:51.945 --> 01:52.946
Sunday Funday... *

01:52.980 --> 01:53.914
>> JIMMY: Bloody Mary and

01:53.947 --> 01:54.948
a triple whiskey neat.

01:54.982 --> 01:55.916
For the love of God, hurry.

01:55.949 --> 01:56.617
>> LINDSAY, EDGAR, GRETCHEN:

01:56.650 --> 01:58.552
* And that is the drunk way!

02:03.324 --> 02:06.194
>> * I'm gonna leave you anyway

02:06.227 --> 02:08.962
I'm gonna leave you anyway

02:08.996 --> 02:12.500
Gonna leave you anyway. *

02:16.737 --> 02:17.705
>> GRETCHEN (laughs): I can't

02:17.738 --> 02:18.939
believe you agreed to come to

02:18.972 --> 02:20.007
Sunday Funday...

02:20.040 --> 02:21.141
>> JIMMY: Just because I decided

02:21.175 --> 02:22.310
to come to a "drinking"

02:22.343 --> 02:23.877
brunch does not mean I'm part

02:23.911 --> 02:25.279
of your juvenile ritual.

02:25.313 --> 02:26.214
>> LINDSAY: Jimmy, Sunday Funday

02:26.247 --> 02:27.515
is not juvenile.

02:27.548 --> 02:28.616
Sunday Funday is about

02:28.649 --> 02:30.384
participating in fun activities

02:30.418 --> 02:31.219
with friends.

02:31.252 --> 02:32.186
>> EDGAR: Sunday Funday is about

02:32.220 --> 02:33.854
squeezing every drop of life out

02:33.887 --> 02:34.855
of the weekend...

02:34.888 --> 02:36.023
before Monday.

02:36.056 --> 02:37.057
>> JIMMY: Right, neither of you

02:37.090 --> 02:38.292
has a job.

02:38.326 --> 02:39.493
>> LINDSAY: You can not have a

02:39.527 --> 02:40.461
job and still hate Mondays.

02:40.494 --> 02:41.495
>> EDGAR: Like Garfield.

02:41.529 --> 02:42.530
>> LINDSAY: Like Garfield,

02:42.563 --> 02:43.531
Jimmy... Garfield.

02:43.564 --> 02:44.665
>> EDGAR: Hmm, well, you picked

02:44.698 --> 02:46.300
the right day to come--

02:46.334 --> 02:47.301
it's my turn.

02:47.335 --> 02:48.035
>> JIMMY: Oh, you take turns.

02:48.068 --> 02:48.569
>> GRETCHEN: Yeah, two weeks

02:48.602 --> 02:49.837
ago, I made a list of

02:49.870 --> 02:50.571
activities.

02:50.604 --> 02:51.372
Last week was Lindser's.

02:51.405 --> 02:53.374
Today is Edgar's.

02:53.407 --> 02:54.375
>> EDGAR: You may not believe

02:54.408 --> 02:55.876
this, but I never got to lead a

02:55.909 --> 02:56.977
mission in Iraq.

02:57.010 --> 02:57.745
>> JIMMY: Hmm.

02:57.778 --> 02:58.746
>> EDGAR: And I'm telling you,

02:58.779 --> 03:00.414
I have designed the Ultimate

03:00.448 --> 03:03.817
Sunday Funday List Ever of All

03:03.851 --> 03:05.253
Time... Ever.

03:05.286 --> 03:06.554
>> JIMMY: What does it say?

03:06.587 --> 03:08.155
"Mooch off Jimmy, scream in your

03:08.188 --> 03:09.357
sleep, threaten people at Best

03:09.390 --> 03:10.358
Buy"?

03:10.391 --> 03:11.259
>> EDGAR: No...

03:11.292 --> 03:12.660
It's a surprise.

03:12.693 --> 03:13.761
>> GROUP (chanting): Sunday

03:13.794 --> 03:14.662
Funday.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.564
Sunday Funday. Sunday Funday.

03:16.597 --> 03:18.566
>> RINGLEADER: * Ooh, yeah, baby

03:18.599 --> 03:19.833
Can't get enough of the Sunday

03:19.867 --> 03:20.734
Now *

03:20.768 --> 03:22.102
>> MAN BUN: * Funday, Sunday

03:22.135 --> 03:23.070
>> RINGLEADER: And...

03:23.103 --> 03:24.071
>> WOMEN: * Fun...

03:24.104 --> 03:25.072
>> RINGLEADER: Really good

03:25.105 --> 03:26.073
stuff.

03:26.106 --> 03:27.107
Really good stuff, you guys.

03:27.140 --> 03:28.108
>> JIMMY: Those are the kind of

03:28.141 --> 03:29.610
people who do Sunday Funday.

03:29.643 --> 03:30.678
>> EDGAR: I'm from L.A.

03:30.711 --> 03:32.346
Fun hipster shit is just poor

03:32.380 --> 03:34.214
Latino shit from ten years ago.

03:34.248 --> 03:35.182
(Lindsay laughs)

03:35.215 --> 03:36.684
I'm telling you, this is gonna

03:36.717 --> 03:39.753
be the most underground, unique

03:39.787 --> 03:41.855
and dope Sunday Funday Ever...

03:41.889 --> 03:43.357
>> RINGLEADER: Hey, man, you,

03:43.391 --> 03:46.093
uh, dropped this.

03:46.126 --> 03:46.860
>> EDGAR (sighs): Thanks.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.128
>> RINGLEADER: Don't worry about

03:48.161 --> 03:48.796
it.

03:48.829 --> 03:49.730
Hey, I think it's really cool

03:49.763 --> 03:50.964
that you guys are doing Sunday

03:50.998 --> 03:52.032
Funday, you know?

03:52.065 --> 03:54.368
I kind of started it.

03:54.402 --> 03:56.136
Recognize these?

03:56.169 --> 03:59.106
From Drive?

03:59.139 --> 04:00.107
(chuckles)

04:00.140 --> 04:02.242
All right, man, have fun.

04:02.276 --> 04:03.444
(giggles)

04:03.477 --> 04:05.112
>> LINDSAY: To Sunday Funday.

04:05.145 --> 04:05.879
(Edgar grunts)

04:05.913 --> 04:06.947
>> GRETCHEN & LINDSAY: * A

04:06.980 --> 04:07.548
Sunday, a Funday

04:07.581 --> 04:08.816
A better than a Monday. *

04:08.849 --> 04:10.117
>> RINGLEADER: * Sunday Funday

04:10.150 --> 04:11.419
Sunday Funday

04:11.452 --> 04:14.254
Beep, ba-boop, Sunday Funday

04:14.288 --> 04:16.790
Ooh, yeah. *

04:18.592 --> 04:20.328
>> JIMMY: Oh, see you.

04:20.361 --> 04:21.829
>> LINDSAY (grunts): Ty invited

04:21.862 --> 04:23.397
Gretchen to go to Tribeca.

04:23.431 --> 04:24.732
They're leaving tonight.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.233
>> JIMMY: Tribeca?!

04:26.266 --> 04:27.167
>> LINDSAY: It's the triangle

04:27.200 --> 04:28.302
for canals, Jimmy.

04:28.336 --> 04:29.403
>> JIMMY: Tonight?

04:29.437 --> 04:31.271
Seriously?

04:31.305 --> 04:32.840
Well, that's fine.

04:32.873 --> 04:34.442
We're both free to do what we

04:34.475 --> 04:35.275
want.

04:35.309 --> 04:36.444
>> LINDSAY: You really want Ty

04:36.477 --> 04:38.312
flying Gretchen on a private

04:38.346 --> 04:39.680
plane to a fancy film festival?

04:39.713 --> 04:40.981
>> JIMMY: Look, she's a big

04:41.014 --> 04:41.682
girl.

04:41.715 --> 04:42.616
She can make her own decisions.

04:42.650 --> 04:43.584
>> LINDSAY: No, she can't!

04:43.617 --> 04:45.953
Her decisions are 99% dog shit.

04:45.986 --> 04:47.455
She got LASIK at the Pasadena

04:47.488 --> 04:48.456
Flea Market.

04:48.489 --> 04:50.257
For some perverse reason, you

04:50.290 --> 04:51.525
make her happy.

04:51.559 --> 04:53.594
So, ask yourself this:

04:53.627 --> 04:55.696
Do you want Ty's claws even

04:55.729 --> 04:57.931
deeper into her?

04:57.965 --> 04:59.467
>> GRETCHEN: Ready, Lindsanity?

04:59.500 --> 05:00.468
>> JIMMY: You know, on second

05:00.501 --> 05:01.469
thought, I think I will witness

05:01.502 --> 05:03.504
this juvenile display myself.

05:03.537 --> 05:04.505
There's near-constant drinking

05:04.538 --> 05:05.305
involved, right?

05:05.339 --> 05:06.507
>> LINDSAY: Near-constant.

05:06.540 --> 05:07.775
>> GRETCHEN: Well... okay.

05:07.808 --> 05:08.542
>> LINDSAY: Full squad!

05:08.576 --> 05:09.543
>> GRETCHEN: Full squad.

05:09.577 --> 05:10.711
>> EDGAR: Full squad.

05:10.744 --> 05:11.679
Let's go!

05:11.712 --> 05:13.914
(Lindsay whoops)

05:16.149 --> 05:18.085
(sighs)

05:23.891 --> 05:25.325
>> LINDSAY: Ew...

05:25.359 --> 05:27.160
Why are records so gross?

05:30.564 --> 05:31.399
(gasps)

05:31.432 --> 05:32.666
(whispers): Hey, look.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.402
That other weird brunch group is

05:34.435 --> 05:35.536
here.

05:35.569 --> 05:36.704
>> EDGAR: Oh, no.

05:36.737 --> 05:37.738
>> LINDSAY: What?

05:37.771 --> 05:39.006
>> EDGAR: Back at the

05:39.039 --> 05:40.374
restaurant, I dropped the list

05:40.408 --> 05:41.475
and that guy returned it.

05:41.509 --> 05:42.676
>> LINDSAY: Aw, that was nice of

05:42.710 --> 05:43.544
him.

05:43.577 --> 05:44.678
>> EDGAR: No, don't you see?

05:44.712 --> 05:46.514
He copied the list.

05:46.547 --> 05:47.648
Otherwise, why would he be at

05:47.681 --> 05:48.682
this exact, obscure record

05:48.716 --> 05:49.683
store?

05:49.717 --> 05:50.718
>> LINDSAY: You're being

05:50.751 --> 05:51.519
paranoid.

05:51.552 --> 05:52.653
>> EDGAR: No...

05:52.686 --> 05:54.422
I've let important intel slip

05:54.455 --> 05:55.656
into the wrong hands before.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.691
Najaf, 2009.

05:57.725 --> 06:00.894
That did not turn out well.

06:03.564 --> 06:04.698
>> JIMMY: Hey...

06:04.732 --> 06:06.333
pick a record, my treat.

06:06.366 --> 06:07.535
>> GRETCHEN: All right,

06:07.568 --> 06:10.070
big spender.

06:12.473 --> 06:13.340
This one.

06:13.373 --> 06:14.074
(Jimmy laughs)

06:14.107 --> 06:15.576
>> JIMMY: Genesis... good.

06:15.609 --> 06:16.677
Okay, but not until you tell me

06:16.710 --> 06:17.945
if you are a Peter Gabriel or a

06:17.978 --> 06:20.013
Phil Collins.

06:20.047 --> 06:21.782
>> GRETCHEN: They're both good.

06:21.815 --> 06:23.851
>> JIMMY: What?

06:23.884 --> 06:25.285
>> GRETCHEN: I like them both.

06:25.318 --> 06:26.219
What's the big deal?

06:26.253 --> 06:28.055
>> JIMMY: The big deal is that

06:28.088 --> 06:29.857
you cannot like two things

06:29.890 --> 06:31.191
which are diametrically

06:31.224 --> 06:32.460
opposed.

06:32.493 --> 06:33.461
>> GRETCHEN: Huh.

06:33.494 --> 06:35.162
And yet I do.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.298
>> RINGLEADER: Oh, hey...

06:38.331 --> 06:39.066
brunch guy.

06:39.099 --> 06:40.133
Oh, you know about this place,

06:40.167 --> 06:40.968
too?

06:41.001 --> 06:41.735
>> EDGAR: Yeah.

06:41.769 --> 06:42.770
>> RINGLEADER: Yeah, I-I love

06:42.803 --> 06:44.538
it, it's so... authentic.

06:44.572 --> 06:45.338
>> EDGAR: Yeah.

06:45.372 --> 06:46.807
That's why it was on my list.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.208
>> RINGLEADER: Oh, cool, yeah.

06:48.241 --> 06:50.243
Mine, too.

07:01.922 --> 07:02.923
>> EDGAR: Cramp.

07:02.956 --> 07:04.758
>> RINGLEADER: Oh, good.

07:04.792 --> 07:06.226
Sunday Funday.

07:06.259 --> 07:11.064
(Ringleader speaking Spanish)

07:11.098 --> 07:12.232
>> LINDSAY: Look! A baby record.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.601
>> GRETCHEN: You rotten bitch!

07:13.634 --> 07:14.768
You're leaving now?

07:14.802 --> 07:15.936
>> LINDSAY: Paul has a work

07:15.969 --> 07:17.104
barbecue.

07:17.137 --> 07:18.271
>> GRETCHEN: I'm facing a major

07:18.305 --> 07:19.607
decision, and you're leaving me

07:19.640 --> 07:20.741
to hang with those

07:20.774 --> 07:21.975
calorie-counting

07:22.009 --> 07:23.076
Restylane-monsters?

07:23.110 --> 07:24.111
>> LINDSAY: I hate the

07:24.144 --> 07:25.278
salad-eaters, too, but I have

07:25.312 --> 07:26.279
to go.

07:26.313 --> 07:27.481
>> GRETCHEN: Just stay for one

07:27.515 --> 07:28.348
more thing on the list.

07:28.381 --> 07:29.116
Please?

07:29.149 --> 07:29.983
>> LINDSAY: Only if you buy me

07:30.017 --> 07:31.685
the little baby record.

07:34.154 --> 07:36.323
>> JIMMY: Ow. Ow. Ow!

07:36.356 --> 07:37.791
>> GRETCHEN: You are the tensest

07:37.825 --> 07:38.992
dude in the world.

07:39.026 --> 07:40.127
>> LINDSAY: You can literally

07:40.160 --> 07:41.495
touch me anywhere.

07:41.529 --> 07:42.663
I'm not shy.

07:42.696 --> 07:43.797
>> JIMMY: Hey, Edgar, how did

07:43.831 --> 07:44.998
you narrow it down to this

07:45.032 --> 07:46.166
massage spot?

07:46.199 --> 07:47.300
I mean, after all, it's so much

07:47.334 --> 07:49.837
easier to just not make choices,

07:49.870 --> 07:51.004
right, Gretch?

07:51.038 --> 07:52.172
>> GRETCHEN: Here we go.

07:52.205 --> 07:53.541
>> EDGAR: What are you talking

07:53.574 --> 07:54.708
about?

07:54.742 --> 07:55.776
>> JIMMY: Peter Gabriel versus

07:55.809 --> 07:56.844
Phil Collins.

07:56.877 --> 07:57.845
>> EDGAR: Remember when Phil

07:57.878 --> 07:59.012
Collins drowned a guy?

07:59.046 --> 08:00.013
>> JIMMY: That's not the story

08:00.047 --> 08:01.014
at all.

08:01.048 --> 08:01.849
That didn't happen.

08:01.882 --> 08:02.716
It was disproven a billion

08:02.750 --> 08:03.784
times.

08:03.817 --> 08:04.852
>> EDGAR: He sent the guy

08:04.885 --> 08:06.053
front-row tickets.

08:06.086 --> 08:07.387
>> JIMMY: Saying "both" is just

08:07.420 --> 08:08.522
a cop-out.

08:08.556 --> 08:09.189
All right, that's it.

08:09.222 --> 08:10.190
I'm helping you figure it out.

08:10.223 --> 08:11.725
>> GRETCHEN: Oh, God.

08:13.894 --> 08:16.196
>> JIMMY: Okay, so I could ask

08:16.229 --> 08:17.565
you-- "Solsbury Hill" or

08:17.598 --> 08:19.232
"Against All Odds."

08:19.266 --> 08:21.168
>> GRETCHEN: Both great.

08:21.201 --> 08:23.170
>> EDGAR: Okay. Aah!

08:23.203 --> 08:24.171
>> JIMMY: Wrong, which is why

08:24.204 --> 08:25.172
we're going to come at this

08:25.205 --> 08:26.006
sideways, okay?

08:26.039 --> 08:26.874
Number one: which do you prefer?

08:26.907 --> 08:27.908
(Lindsay screams, thuds)

08:27.941 --> 08:31.011
Sean Connery or Roger Moore?

08:31.044 --> 08:32.345
>> GRETCHEN: Daniel Craig.

08:32.379 --> 08:34.314
Update your references, old man.

08:34.347 --> 08:35.382
>> JIMMY: Daniel Craig?

08:35.415 --> 08:36.750
He looks like an upset baby.

08:36.784 --> 08:39.653
(Gretchen laughs)

08:39.687 --> 08:40.821
>> GRETCHEN: Oh, my God,

08:40.854 --> 08:43.356
he does.

08:43.390 --> 08:45.693
>> EDGAR: Let it out. Throw it!

08:45.726 --> 08:46.860
>> JIMMY: Okay, eggs or

08:46.894 --> 08:47.995
pancakes?

08:48.028 --> 08:49.096
>> GRETCHEN: Which one's Phil

08:49.129 --> 08:50.063
Collins, and which one's Peter

08:50.097 --> 08:51.064
Gabriel?

08:51.098 --> 08:52.065
>> JIMMY: Are you serious?

08:52.099 --> 08:53.266
Edgar, what are we doing here?

08:53.300 --> 08:54.568
>> EDGAR: The most obscure taco

08:54.602 --> 08:55.736
stand...

08:55.769 --> 08:59.239
What?!

08:59.272 --> 09:00.273
>> FOOD COLUMNIST: Well, this

09:00.307 --> 09:01.609
place is over.

09:07.881 --> 09:08.849
>> RINGLEADER: Oh, cool.

09:08.882 --> 09:09.683
You guys know about this place,

09:09.717 --> 09:11.719
too?

09:17.257 --> 09:19.526
>> GRETCHEN: Look, Jimmy, I like

09:19.559 --> 09:21.394
the Tarz soundtrack, and I

09:21.428 --> 09:22.963
like the crappy Vampire Weekend

09:22.996 --> 09:24.097
song that name-checks Peter

09:24.131 --> 09:25.132
Gabriel.

09:25.165 --> 09:26.266
I'm down with it all.

09:26.299 --> 09:27.601
Why does this bother you so

09:27.635 --> 09:28.568
much?

09:28.602 --> 09:29.737
>> JIMMY: It's just such a lazy

09:29.770 --> 09:30.938
way of living.

09:30.971 --> 09:32.105
"Put it in my vagina or my butt.

09:32.139 --> 09:33.106
I don't care."

09:33.140 --> 09:34.141
>> LINDSAY: Sometimes you want

09:34.174 --> 09:35.275
both.

09:35.308 --> 09:36.376
>> GRETCHEN: Yeah, Jimmy.

09:36.409 --> 09:37.878
Sometimes you want both.

09:37.911 --> 09:38.879
(Gretchen mouthing words)

09:38.912 --> 09:39.980
Anyway, your whole thesis is

09:40.013 --> 09:41.248
flawed.

09:41.281 --> 09:42.750
Not everything is one or the

09:42.783 --> 09:43.917
other.

09:43.951 --> 09:44.985
Edgar is both a patriot and a

09:45.018 --> 09:46.219
skeptic.

09:46.253 --> 09:47.320
>> EDGAR: True dat.

09:47.354 --> 09:48.221
>> GRETCHEN: Lindsay's both a

09:48.255 --> 09:49.089
wife and a skank.

09:49.122 --> 09:50.257
>> LINDSAY: Recovering, but,

09:50.290 --> 09:51.458
yeah, totally.

09:51.491 --> 09:52.592
>> GRETCHEN: I'm professional

09:52.626 --> 09:53.927
and completely unprofessional.

09:53.961 --> 09:55.095
>> JIMMY: Well, that's true.

09:55.128 --> 09:56.296
>> GRETCHEN: And, you, Jimmy--

09:56.329 --> 09:58.331
you're...

09:58.365 --> 10:01.301
You're just one thing.

10:01.334 --> 10:02.469
>> JIMMY: Exactly.

10:02.502 --> 10:03.937
>> LINDSAY: You stop it.

10:03.971 --> 10:05.105
Oh, my God.

10:05.138 --> 10:07.074
(Lindsay screaming)

10:07.107 --> 10:08.241
(phone chimes)

10:08.275 --> 10:10.110
>> JIMMY: Well, you're very

10:10.143 --> 10:11.311
popular today.

10:11.344 --> 10:13.781
>> GRETCHEN: I know. Sorry.

10:13.814 --> 10:14.948
There, I'm done.

10:14.982 --> 10:16.917
You know why I don't want to

10:16.950 --> 10:18.652
pick Peter Gabriel or Phil

10:18.686 --> 10:19.619
Collins?

10:19.653 --> 10:21.454
Because you are just waiting for

10:21.488 --> 10:22.956
me to pick wrong so you can

10:22.990 --> 10:24.291
judge me, and why would I want

10:24.324 --> 10:26.359
to put myself through that?

10:26.393 --> 10:27.761
>> JIMMY: Because I'm asking you

10:27.795 --> 10:29.730
to.

10:35.002 --> 10:36.369
>> GRETCHEN: You told him.

10:36.403 --> 10:38.005
>> LINDSAY: What?! No.

10:38.038 --> 10:39.439
Gretch, stop overthinking

10:39.472 --> 10:40.507
everything.

10:40.540 --> 10:41.942
He's trying to be a good sport

10:41.975 --> 10:43.010
and hang out.

10:43.043 --> 10:44.211
Just enjoy it.

10:44.244 --> 10:45.378
>> GRETCHEN: Okay, I'll try,

10:45.412 --> 10:46.513
but don't leave.

10:46.546 --> 10:47.715
>> LINDSAY: I know, it's gonna

10:47.748 --> 10:50.317
suck so hard, but Paul has been

10:50.350 --> 10:54.855
really patient.

10:54.888 --> 10:56.023
(Paul yawning)

10:56.056 --> 10:57.190
>> GRETCHEN: Wait.

10:57.224 --> 10:58.391
Has Paul been...?

10:58.425 --> 10:59.459
>> LINDSAY: You'll make the

10:59.492 --> 11:01.895
right decision.

11:05.098 --> 11:06.233
>> GRETCHEN: What's next?

11:06.266 --> 11:07.300
>> EDGAR: Come on, I'll show

11:07.334 --> 11:08.301
you.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.537
It's the best one yet.

11:15.408 --> 11:16.576
>> GRETCHEN: Faster! Faster!

11:16.609 --> 11:17.745
>> JIMMY: No, slow down!

11:17.778 --> 11:19.079
>> EDGAR: Shopping cart races

11:19.112 --> 11:21.949
were my favorite as a kid.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.486
Yeah!

11:26.519 --> 11:28.922
(group hoots and whoops)

11:52.279 --> 11:53.914
>> EDGAR: Jimmy!

11:53.947 --> 11:55.949
You okay?

12:01.221 --> 12:02.089
>> JIMMY: I just want to go

12:02.122 --> 12:03.690
home and shower!

12:03.723 --> 12:05.425
What are we doing here?

12:05.458 --> 12:06.459
>> EDGAR: Open houses are on the

12:06.493 --> 12:07.460
list.

12:07.494 --> 12:08.628
Plus, this real estate lady

12:08.661 --> 12:10.363
always has freshly baked

12:10.397 --> 12:11.531
cookies.

12:11.564 --> 12:12.866
>> GRETCHEN: Great idea, Edgar.

12:12.900 --> 12:14.868
A free activity where you can

12:14.902 --> 12:16.603
snoop on your neighbors and

12:16.636 --> 12:18.138
judge their shitty taste?

12:18.171 --> 12:21.241
Yes, please.

12:21.274 --> 12:22.242
Get upstairs.

12:22.275 --> 12:24.244
>> JIMMY: What...?!

12:26.579 --> 12:27.414
>> GRETCHEN: Quick, take a

12:27.447 --> 12:28.248
shower.

12:28.281 --> 12:29.249
>> JIMMY: Come on, what... here?

12:29.282 --> 12:30.217
>> GRETCHEN: Do what I say.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.418
I'll get you some dry clothes.

12:31.451 --> 12:32.986
Sunday Funday.

12:33.020 --> 12:35.789
>> JIMMY: Oh, Gretchen, come on.

12:48.135 --> 12:48.802
>> JIMMY: Oh, right!

12:48.836 --> 12:49.769
I thought of another one, okay?

12:49.803 --> 12:51.438
Chekov's plays or Chekov's

12:51.471 --> 12:52.672
short stor... (laughs)

12:53.606 --> 12:55.775
Gretchen?

12:58.678 --> 13:00.848
(Gretchen conversing, muffled)

13:03.650 --> 13:05.185
>> GRETCHEN: I know, it sounds

13:05.218 --> 13:07.087
amazing, Ty.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.421
I gotta go.

13:08.455 --> 13:11.458
I'll call you in a bit.

13:11.491 --> 13:12.492
>> EDGAR: The real estate lady

13:12.525 --> 13:13.827
said Jimmy left.

13:13.861 --> 13:15.495
>> GRETCHEN: He did?!

13:15.528 --> 13:16.529
Well, Sunday Funday's over.

13:16.563 --> 13:17.364
>> EDGAR: No!

13:17.397 --> 13:18.265
We can't quit now.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.166
>> GRETCHEN: We don't have a

13:19.199 --> 13:20.033
car.

13:20.067 --> 13:21.601
Jimmy drove.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.503
>> RINGLEADER (chuckling): Whoa.

13:23.536 --> 13:25.772
Are you guys following us?

13:25.805 --> 13:26.706
>> EDGAR: You son of a bitch.

13:26.739 --> 13:28.341
You stole my list.

13:28.375 --> 13:29.176
>> RINGLEADER: What are you

13:29.209 --> 13:29.877
talking about?

13:29.910 --> 13:30.777
>> GRETCHEN: Edgar.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.445
>> EDGAR: Back at brunch,

13:32.479 --> 13:34.114
I dropped the list and he

13:34.147 --> 13:36.016
clearly copied everything on it.

13:36.049 --> 13:38.018
He stole our Sunday Funday.

13:38.051 --> 13:39.519
>> RINGLEADER: No, I didn't.

13:39.552 --> 13:40.453
>> EDGAR: Open houses are on

13:40.487 --> 13:41.454
your list, too?

13:41.488 --> 13:43.290
And this exact two-bedroom

13:43.323 --> 13:45.558
colonial charmer?

13:45.592 --> 13:46.526
>> RINGLEADER: We look for Patty

13:46.559 --> 13:48.728
Kohan's open houses.

13:48.761 --> 13:51.564
She always has cookies.

13:51.598 --> 13:53.800
What's that in your hand, man?

13:53.833 --> 13:56.069
Looks like a cookie.

13:56.103 --> 13:58.105
(laughs)

14:00.908 --> 14:02.075
>> GRETCHEN: I like your

14:02.109 --> 14:02.910
sweatshirt.

14:02.943 --> 14:04.144
>> SWEATSHIRT GIRL: Oh, my God,

14:04.177 --> 14:04.912
thanks.

14:04.945 --> 14:07.014
How's your Sunday Funday going?

14:07.047 --> 14:07.981
>> GRETCHEN: Actually, I'm just

14:08.015 --> 14:08.982
using it as a distraction so I

14:09.016 --> 14:10.217
don't have to decide between two

14:10.250 --> 14:10.984
guys.

14:11.018 --> 14:12.185
>> SWEATSHIRT GIRL: Oh, I hear

14:12.219 --> 14:12.986
you.

14:13.020 --> 14:14.821
I am in love with Keith.

14:14.854 --> 14:15.755
>> GRETCHEN: The guy with the

14:15.788 --> 14:16.756
man bun?

14:16.789 --> 14:17.757
>> SWEATSHIRT GIRL: We've been

14:17.790 --> 14:18.825
doing Sunday Funday for, like,

14:18.858 --> 14:20.727
two years, and he still calls

14:20.760 --> 14:21.995
me Sloppy Sweatshirt Girl.

14:22.029 --> 14:23.863
So I totally understand where

14:23.897 --> 14:25.865
you're coming from.

14:25.899 --> 14:28.401
>> GRETCHEN: Yeah, cool.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.705
I need to talk to Lindsay.

14:32.739 --> 14:33.740
>> EDGAR: She's at Paul's

14:33.773 --> 14:35.108
West Side barbecue.

14:35.142 --> 14:37.010
How are we gonna get there?

14:37.044 --> 14:41.014
We don't have a car.

14:41.048 --> 14:43.083
No.

14:43.116 --> 14:44.717
No.

14:44.751 --> 14:47.287
*

14:51.424 --> 14:53.560
(Gretchen mouthing words)

15:06.573 --> 15:09.076
(women laughing)

15:11.078 --> 15:13.580
>> GRETCHEN: Excuse me.

15:13.613 --> 15:16.083
Ladies, I need to borrow dear

15:16.116 --> 15:18.751
Linds for a second.

15:18.785 --> 15:21.121
Toodles!

15:22.755 --> 15:25.058
>> * I got it all

15:25.092 --> 15:29.929
I got it all indeed

15:29.963 --> 15:33.766
Got everything I want

15:33.800 --> 15:37.937
* Everything I need

15:37.971 --> 15:40.840
But what I don't got is

15:40.873 --> 15:43.276
A feeling that's inside... *

15:43.310 --> 15:44.477
>> LINDSAY: They're not that

15:44.511 --> 15:45.512
bad.

15:45.545 --> 15:46.313
>> GRETCHEN: I knew it!

15:46.346 --> 15:47.514
There is one over there dressed

15:47.547 --> 15:48.515
head-to-toe in riding gear.

15:48.548 --> 15:49.482
There is not a horse around

15:49.516 --> 15:50.517
for miles.

15:50.550 --> 15:51.518
>> LINDSAY: Anyway, this is

15:51.551 --> 15:52.519
your fault!

15:52.552 --> 15:53.520
>> GRETCHEN: How?!

15:53.553 --> 15:54.587
>> LINDSAY: Around you I'm

15:54.621 --> 15:55.355
never the cool one.

15:55.388 --> 15:57.857
But with them, I'm the coolest.

15:57.890 --> 15:59.126
By, like, miles.

15:59.159 --> 16:00.127
>> GRETCHEN: First, you get

16:00.160 --> 16:01.661
married, then you abandon me for

16:01.694 --> 16:03.196
these Botoxed pterodactyls.

16:03.230 --> 16:04.831
I've never done that to you.

16:04.864 --> 16:05.832
I don't even have any other

16:05.865 --> 16:07.334
friends.

16:07.367 --> 16:09.002
Plus, you lied when you said you

16:09.036 --> 16:10.637
were dreading coming here.

16:10.670 --> 16:11.704
>> LINDSAY: I wasn't lying.

16:11.738 --> 16:13.040
That's the weird thing.

16:13.073 --> 16:14.341
I don't even know exactly what I

16:14.374 --> 16:15.508
was dreading.

16:15.542 --> 16:16.809
I like the people.

16:16.843 --> 16:18.145
I like the food.

16:18.178 --> 16:20.447
I don't know what it is.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.149
>> PAUL: Sweetie, Jenna wants to

16:22.182 --> 16:23.516
know if she should serve your

16:23.550 --> 16:25.718
spinach dip with water crackers

16:25.752 --> 16:27.954
or toast points.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.056
>> LINDSAY: Just go away!

16:29.089 --> 16:31.858
I'll be right there!

16:31.891 --> 16:33.860
So, yeah.

16:33.893 --> 16:35.228
I can't quite put my finger on

16:35.262 --> 16:37.697
what it is I don't like here.

16:37.730 --> 16:40.233
What?

16:42.935 --> 16:44.704
I mean, I'm sure at some point,

16:44.737 --> 16:45.838
everybody looks at their

16:45.872 --> 16:47.974
husband and is like,

16:48.007 --> 16:50.910
"Eh, that's my future.

16:50.943 --> 16:53.080
That's it.

16:53.113 --> 16:55.215
And why does it smell like ham

16:55.248 --> 16:58.085
all the time?"

16:58.118 --> 16:59.752
That's normal, right?

16:59.786 --> 17:03.090
>> GRETCHEN: I hope not.

17:03.123 --> 17:05.925
>> LINDSAY: I just wish I had

17:05.958 --> 17:07.194
what you have.

17:07.227 --> 17:09.196
>> GRETCHEN: What do I have?

17:09.229 --> 17:10.263
>> LINDSAY: Someone I wanted to

17:10.297 --> 17:11.931
do Sunday Funday with.

17:11.964 --> 17:12.932
>> GRETCHEN: Actually,

17:12.965 --> 17:14.267
he bailed.

17:14.301 --> 17:15.502
I was hoping he'd stick around

17:15.535 --> 17:17.404
to help me figure out what to do

17:17.437 --> 17:19.472
about Ty, but he's...

17:23.110 --> 17:25.612
He's here!

17:33.786 --> 17:35.288
>> GRETCHEN: Well, well.

17:35.322 --> 17:36.856
>> JIMMY: Hey.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.291
Listen, um... (clears throat)

17:38.325 --> 17:40.227
Phil Collins--

17:40.260 --> 17:41.561
he has his merits, all right?

17:41.594 --> 17:44.197
As lightweight and nutritionless

17:44.231 --> 17:45.132
they are.

17:45.165 --> 17:46.133
I mean, really, "Land of

17:46.166 --> 17:47.267
Confusion," with is leaden pleas

17:47.300 --> 17:48.368
for world peace and the

17:48.401 --> 17:50.403
healing power of love.

17:50.437 --> 17:52.205
Thank you, George Bernard Shaw.

17:52.239 --> 17:53.406
Give me a fortnight to machete

17:53.440 --> 17:54.407
my way through the dense...

17:54.441 --> 17:55.442
>> GRETCHEN: Jimmy...

17:55.475 --> 17:56.609
>> JIMMY: ...metaphoric thicket

17:56.643 --> 17:57.444
of those lyrics.

17:57.477 --> 17:58.445
>> GRETCHEN: Jimmy...

17:58.478 --> 17:59.412
>> JIMMY: And while Peter

17:59.446 --> 18:01.414
Gabriel, he's, he's complex,

18:01.448 --> 18:03.416
dark, you know, interesting,

18:03.450 --> 18:06.253
I recognize that it can be nice

18:06.286 --> 18:09.256
to have some breezy "No Reply

18:09.289 --> 18:10.990
at All" fun.

18:11.023 --> 18:12.459
You know, but following you

18:12.492 --> 18:15.262
around all day today just trying

18:15.295 --> 18:17.063
to convince you what to do?

18:17.096 --> 18:19.098
Well, it's... it's just made me

18:19.132 --> 18:21.501
feel, just-just made me feel

18:21.534 --> 18:24.771
a-ashamed and jealous

18:24.804 --> 18:26.939
and low.

18:26.973 --> 18:28.775
Like Phil Collins when he

18:28.808 --> 18:29.776
wrote "Sussudio."

18:29.809 --> 18:30.577
>> GRETCHEN: Jimmy...

18:30.610 --> 18:32.145
>> JIMMY: But if one day, right,

18:32.179 --> 18:34.113
eggs forced you to choose

18:34.147 --> 18:36.283
between themselves and pancakes,

18:36.316 --> 18:38.017
and you chose the soggy,

18:38.050 --> 18:40.953
tasteless pancakes and never ate

18:40.987 --> 18:43.022
eggs ever again, I'm just

18:43.055 --> 18:45.592
saying eggs...

18:45.625 --> 18:47.126
the eggs would be really sad.

18:47.160 --> 18:48.127
>> GRETCHEN: Jimmy.

18:48.161 --> 18:49.095
>> JIMMY: What?

18:49.128 --> 18:50.129
>> GRETCHEN: If you don't want

18:50.163 --> 18:51.097
me to go on this trip, just

18:51.130 --> 18:52.131
tell me.

18:52.165 --> 18:53.800
>> JIMMY: Don't go.

18:53.833 --> 18:55.335
>> GRETCHEN: Okay.

18:55.368 --> 18:59.038
I won't.

18:59.071 --> 19:01.208
So, just to be clear.

19:01.241 --> 19:03.510
On one side, it's eggs, Peter

19:03.543 --> 19:04.611
Gabriel and you, and on the

19:04.644 --> 19:07.113
other side it's pancakes, Phil

19:07.146 --> 19:08.114
Collins and Ty?

19:08.147 --> 19:09.115
>> JIMMY: You know, I've been

19:09.148 --> 19:10.116
drinking all day and honestly

19:10.149 --> 19:11.484
I'm not even sure anymore.

19:11.518 --> 19:12.819
>> SWEATSHIRT GIRL: Gretchen!

19:12.852 --> 19:15.154
I did it!

19:15.188 --> 19:16.189
>> GRETCHEN: Good for you,

19:16.223 --> 19:17.890
Sloppy Sweatshirt Girl.

19:17.924 --> 19:19.392
Good for... you.

19:19.426 --> 19:20.527
You want to get out of here?

19:20.560 --> 19:23.062
>> JIMMY: Immediately.

19:28.235 --> 19:30.537
>> EDGAR: I just... things have

19:30.570 --> 19:33.072
been messed up, and I guess I

19:33.105 --> 19:34.574
thought if I could do a good job

19:34.607 --> 19:36.576
today, maybe I'd have the boost

19:36.609 --> 19:38.578
to get my shit back on track.

19:38.611 --> 19:40.413
>> RINGLEADER: Yeah, well...

19:40.447 --> 19:42.815
Sorry, man.

19:42.849 --> 19:45.585
>> EDGAR: It's not your fault.

19:47.454 --> 19:50.590
>> RINGLEADER: All right.

19:50.623 --> 19:52.359
>> EDGAR: My list!

19:52.392 --> 19:53.593
I knew it!

19:53.626 --> 19:55.328
>> RINGLEADER: Okay, okay, okay.

19:55.362 --> 19:57.196
Shit. Okay, look.

19:57.230 --> 19:58.365
Look, these guys rely on me

19:58.398 --> 20:00.433
to come up with awesome, cool,

20:00.467 --> 20:02.001
underground cultural shit to do

20:02.034 --> 20:02.702
every single week.

20:02.735 --> 20:04.170
You know how much pressure

20:04.203 --> 20:06.273
that puts on me?

20:06.306 --> 20:07.674
I got shingles trying to find

20:07.707 --> 20:09.709
a new Ethiopian restaurant.

20:09.742 --> 20:10.877
Please don't blow up my spot,

20:10.910 --> 20:12.211
man.

20:12.245 --> 20:13.212
Please!

20:13.246 --> 20:14.414
Okay?

20:14.447 --> 20:17.384
I have trouble making friends.

20:17.417 --> 20:19.352
>> EDGAR: Wow.

20:19.386 --> 20:20.620
>> RINGLEADER: What?

20:20.653 --> 20:21.854
>> EDGAR: I'm screwed up

20:21.888 --> 20:24.691
because I saw my friends die.

20:24.724 --> 20:27.794
You're screwed up because...

20:27.827 --> 20:29.429
you're just a really lame dude.

20:29.462 --> 20:31.431
Thanks for making me feel

20:31.464 --> 20:33.966
better.

20:36.669 --> 20:37.970
>> RINGLEADER: Wait, your

20:38.004 --> 20:39.439
friends died?

20:39.472 --> 20:41.541
The ones from today?

20:41.574 --> 20:44.544
What happened?!

20:44.577 --> 20:45.712
Hey.

20:45.745 --> 20:49.148
Yeah... yeah...

20:49.181 --> 20:50.149
>> LINDSAY: There you are,

20:50.182 --> 20:50.950
honey.

20:50.983 --> 20:52.218
I came to a decision about the

20:52.251 --> 20:53.453
toast points.

20:53.486 --> 20:54.421
(screams)

20:54.454 --> 20:55.422
>> MOMMY: Isabel was getting

20:55.455 --> 20:56.423
fussy and I asked Paul to hold

20:56.456 --> 20:57.924
her for a second and she quieted

20:57.957 --> 20:58.758
right up.

20:58.791 --> 20:59.759
>> PAUL: I'm a natural.

20:59.792 --> 21:00.760
>> MOMMY: What about you?

21:00.793 --> 21:01.928
Gonna be ready for one of these

21:01.961 --> 21:03.963
guys soon?

21:05.465 --> 21:09.436
