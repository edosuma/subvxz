00:01.827 --> 00:04.395
My name is Kara Zor-El.
I'm from Krypton.

00:04.439 --> 00:06.658
I'm a refugee on this planet.

00:06.702 --> 00:09.226
I was sent to Earth
to protect my cousin.

00:09.270 --> 00:11.141
But my pod
got knocked off course.

00:11.185 --> 00:12.708
And by the time I got here,

00:12.751 --> 00:17.452
my cousin had already grown up and become... Superman.

00:17.495 --> 00:19.845
I hid who I really was
until one day

00:19.889 --> 00:23.588
when an accident forced me to reveal myself to the world.

00:23.632 --> 00:27.027
To most people, I"m a reporter
at CatCo Worldwide Media.

00:27.070 --> 00:30.334
But in secret I work
with my adopted sister
at the DEO

00:30.378 --> 00:32.597
to protect this planet
I call my home

00:32.641 --> 00:34.730
from anyone that means
to cause it harm.

00:36.166 --> 00:38.386
I am Supergirl.

00:39.778 --> 00:41.780
Previously onSupergirl...

00:41.824 --> 00:43.347
My own show.

00:43.391 --> 00:45.697
You are watching
The Lockdown
with Ben Lockwood.

00:45.741 --> 00:46.959
Dad, you're famous.

00:47.003 --> 00:48.439
Two dozen known alien worlds,

00:48.483 --> 00:50.180
and Nth metal
is just the strongest material

00:50.224 --> 00:52.095
brought to Earth
from any one of them, by far.

00:52.139 --> 00:53.749
Agent Liberty
took everything from me.

00:53.792 --> 00:55.881
I will do anything to see him brought to justice.

00:58.232 --> 00:59.494
Who is Agent Liberty?

00:59.537 --> 01:01.191
You betrayed
your promise to Fiona.

01:01.235 --> 01:03.585
Once you cross that line,
there is no going back.

01:03.628 --> 01:05.108
I have that sleep thing.

01:05.152 --> 01:06.370
-Yes!

01:06.414 --> 01:08.111
Mom was trying
to find her a doctor,

01:08.155 --> 01:09.199
but Nia said
she already had one.

01:09.243 --> 01:10.766
Why would she lie about that?

01:18.948 --> 01:19.949
Hi.

01:22.560 --> 01:24.910
Hot day.
I've seen worse.

01:27.870 --> 01:30.177
Are you supposed
to be meeting someone here?

01:30.220 --> 01:32.266
-Waiting for the bus.
-Oh.

01:48.064 --> 01:49.631
You sleep weird.

01:49.674 --> 01:53.243
Some roommate.
I told you
not to let me sleep.

01:53.287 --> 01:58.988
Uh, I gave you two hours
so you wouldn't look like
a crackhead at work again.

01:59.031 --> 02:02.731
The average Fortune 500 CEO
only gets five hours
of sleep a night.

02:02.774 --> 02:06.474
The average CEO
doesn't get to be a CEO

02:06.517 --> 02:08.693
if she's dead from exhaustion.

02:09.912 --> 02:12.958
You needed an object Manchester holds close, right?

02:14.351 --> 02:17.137
Anything that can help me
reach him psychically,

02:17.180 --> 02:18.529
clothing, jewelry.

02:20.792 --> 02:22.272
He hurt someone in here.

02:22.316 --> 02:24.448
Seems like he does that
to everyone he meets.

02:24.492 --> 02:28.496
Man,
I am still so sorry
about what happened.

02:29.584 --> 02:31.151
I led you right into his trap.

02:31.194 --> 02:35.329
You're apologizing to me for
believing the best in someone?

02:35.372 --> 02:36.982
It's kind of my whole thing.

02:37.026 --> 02:40.812
-You wouldn't have
let him get away.
-I did let him play me.

02:40.856 --> 02:45.208
Look, his... His rage
was overpowering,
you lost him. It happens.

02:45.252 --> 02:47.471
But it's not over yet.

02:47.515 --> 02:48.907
That's what I'm afraid of.

02:48.951 --> 02:50.605
I thought there was
some light left in Manchester,

02:50.648 --> 02:53.782
but when I
looked into his mind,
there was nothing left.

02:54.478 --> 02:55.958
Maybe you can get it back.

03:03.226 --> 03:04.488
Brass knuckles.

03:05.837 --> 03:08.013
Well, he does have
national pride.

03:08.057 --> 03:09.450
And Bob's your uncle.

03:17.501 --> 03:18.894
Hold the door!

03:18.937 --> 03:20.112
Thank you.

03:20.156 --> 03:21.288
Um...

03:21.331 --> 03:22.985
Stockpiling for
the great coffee war?

03:23.028 --> 03:25.988
-Uh... No, no.
These are extras for friends.

03:26.031 --> 03:28.425
-One more! Sorry.
-Hey.

03:28.469 --> 03:29.557
-Thanks.
-Good morning.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.254
-Hey, James!
-Hey.

03:31.298 --> 03:34.388
Hey, Nia.
Are those all for you?

03:34.431 --> 03:36.825
No, she brought
extra for friends.

03:38.870 --> 03:39.915
So, how goes it?

03:40.959 --> 03:42.831
Lena is just being so distant.

03:42.874 --> 03:45.399
I mean... We're gonna talk.
I'm sure we'll work it out.

03:45.442 --> 03:47.183
-Hmm.
-Yeah.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.663
I meant the article.

03:49.533 --> 03:50.795
-Oh.

03:54.190 --> 03:55.365
Oh!

03:56.758 --> 03:57.933
You okay?

03:57.976 --> 04:00.588
-Yeah, I'm fine.
-Nia.

04:00.631 --> 04:02.459
Wait. Nia, Nia. Wait.

04:03.634 --> 04:07.203
I... I know something's
going on with you. I...

04:07.247 --> 04:08.770
At Thanksgiving,
you told different people

04:08.813 --> 04:10.946
different versions
of your narcolepsy story,

04:10.989 --> 04:12.948
and none of them matched.

04:12.991 --> 04:16.299
And now you're...
You're drinking
gallons of coffee

04:16.343 --> 04:18.258
and freaking out at the TV...

04:18.301 --> 04:20.782
Agent Liberty, on the TV,

04:20.825 --> 04:23.437
it reminded me
of a nightmare I had.

04:23.480 --> 04:26.309
Nia, I'm getting worried,
and I want to help you.

04:26.353 --> 04:27.745
I'm really okay.

04:31.009 --> 04:32.402
I'm Agent Liberty.

04:37.668 --> 04:38.713
Frank...

04:40.018 --> 04:44.022
Respectfully, you are not
leadership material.

04:45.067 --> 04:48.288
However, we know
you were on Shelley Island,

04:48.331 --> 04:50.855
and your background
has oddly been erased.

04:50.899 --> 04:55.686
So I've got a hunch
you can tell us
who Agent Liberty is.

04:57.427 --> 04:59.951
I am Agent Liberty.

04:59.995 --> 05:02.780
We offer plea deals, we tell
them we're gonna lock them up,

05:02.824 --> 05:04.565
and they just keep saying
the same thing.

05:05.217 --> 05:07.089
Doing a Spartacus.

05:08.743 --> 05:10.875
By which I mean our captured
Children of Liberty

05:10.919 --> 05:12.703
claim the identity
of their hero.

05:12.747 --> 05:14.966
Oh, you're watching
the classics?

05:15.010 --> 05:16.316
I'm mastering them.

05:16.359 --> 05:17.708
Would you like to
discuss auteur theory

05:17.752 --> 05:19.841
-Yeah, definitely.

05:21.103 --> 05:22.234
Any leads from CatCo?

05:22.278 --> 05:26.064
No. No,
but we're getting close.

05:26.108 --> 05:28.240
I can feel it in my gut.

05:28.284 --> 05:29.851
Could be a probiotic issue.

05:29.894 --> 05:31.679
But I do concur.

05:31.722 --> 05:34.638
Agent Liberty's presence
is still a threat,
even... Even without...

05:35.552 --> 05:37.728
What is it?

05:37.772 --> 05:42.385
Oh. Nia Nal saw that picture
this morning
and kinda freaked out.

05:42.429 --> 05:44.213
-Yeah.

05:44.256 --> 05:47.303
She said it reminded her
of a nightmare or something.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.479
-Who knows if that's true.

05:50.437 --> 05:53.918
And you just let her go?

05:53.962 --> 05:56.747
-Yeah.

05:56.791 --> 05:58.575
There's no version of me
telling you what I know

05:58.619 --> 06:00.272
that does not impact
the space-time continuum.

06:00.316 --> 06:02.274
Whoa.

06:02.318 --> 06:04.581
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You know about Nia Nal
in the 31st century?

06:06.453 --> 06:08.455
What... Brainy, who is she?

06:08.498 --> 06:09.760
Better we don't discuss that.

06:09.804 --> 06:12.154
Future abrogation,
the butterfly effect,

06:12.197 --> 06:14.156
causal loops, etc, etc.

06:14.199 --> 06:15.897
Why do you think I kept this
from you at Thanksgiving

06:15.940 --> 06:18.160
when I so easily,
yet expertly,
deduced her import?

06:20.075 --> 06:21.511
All you need to know

06:21.555 --> 06:23.948
is that Nia might be able
to lead us to Agent Liberty.

06:23.992 --> 06:27.038
-We must go to her at once.
-Okay, okay. But--

06:27.082 --> 06:28.605
She's a little
freaked out right now,

06:28.649 --> 06:30.825
so maybe let me break the ice.

06:31.565 --> 06:32.914
Yes, of course.

06:32.957 --> 06:34.524
All right, fine.
Just go see Nia.

06:34.568 --> 06:36.265
Let me know
if you have any leads.

06:36.308 --> 06:37.962
Then, at least, I'll have
something to report
to the President.

06:38.006 --> 06:40.008
Are you having another
one

06:41.401 --> 06:44.621
-Ooh, I hope Haley
so gets yelled at.
-Yeah.

06:44.665 --> 06:46.318
This is a complete disaster.

06:47.494 --> 06:49.887
Lives were saved
on Shelley Island,

06:49.931 --> 06:52.020
a dozen domestic terrorists
were brought to justice.

06:52.063 --> 06:54.762
I'm talking about
my poll numbers,

06:54.805 --> 06:56.807
which just got
a big old shave!

06:56.851 --> 06:58.330
I'm sorry.
You're letting polls dictate--

06:58.374 --> 06:59.810
Sir, you have my word.

06:59.854 --> 07:02.639
As soon as we take down
this organization's leader,

07:02.683 --> 07:04.641
your numbers will be back
to their usual luster.

07:04.685 --> 07:08.471
If you think finding
Agent Liberty will fix this,

07:08.515 --> 07:10.560
find Agent Liberty.

07:12.388 --> 07:13.781
Yes, sir.

07:18.699 --> 07:20.962
No, Thack,
I'm telling you
not to worry.

07:21.005 --> 07:22.964
Look, the war
that we are waging
has multiple fronts.

07:23.007 --> 07:28.012
Just because we've had
setbacks on our more, uh,
bellicose endeavors--

07:28.056 --> 07:31.451
Bellicose. It means,
"war-like," Thack.

07:31.494 --> 07:34.497
Okay, Thack, listen up.

07:34.541 --> 07:36.673
Agent Liberty
appealed to extremists,

07:36.717 --> 07:39.371
whereas Ben Lockwood
is turning--

07:39.415 --> 07:41.504
Uh, Ben Lockwood, me.
I mean, me.

07:41.548 --> 07:45.726
I am turning
the broader tide against
Supergirl and her kind.

07:45.769 --> 07:48.990
And so, all I'm asking is...

07:49.033 --> 07:52.646
Can we-- Can we
just put Agent Liberty
aside for a little bit?

07:52.689 --> 07:54.430
He'll come back
when the time is right.

07:55.257 --> 07:56.737
In the meantime...

07:57.955 --> 08:00.741
Right now, let's...
Let's let Ben drive.

08:23.459 --> 08:26.549
There he is. Ben, your friend
is here from the university.

08:26.593 --> 08:27.811
Manchester Black.

08:29.204 --> 08:31.249
Thought I'd pop by
and say hello.

08:49.224 --> 08:50.530
Manchester...

08:52.270 --> 08:54.098
Where are you?

08:54.142 --> 08:57.493
So, I decided
to ditch the city
for the afternoon

08:57.537 --> 08:59.234
and pay a visit
to old Benjamin.

09:00.844 --> 09:03.760
Kill two birds
with one stone,
as it were.

09:03.804 --> 09:05.109
Well, I think it's very
thoughtful of you

09:05.153 --> 09:07.634
to come all the way here
in person to thank him.

09:07.677 --> 09:09.287
How could I not
after what he did?

09:12.943 --> 09:14.641
I'm talking
about the gift, man.

09:14.684 --> 09:17.034
The gift.
Yes, of course, the gift.

09:17.078 --> 09:18.296
What gift?

09:20.342 --> 09:22.126
The wedding gift.

09:22.170 --> 09:24.825
A great big set of knives
for me and my fiancee...

09:26.043 --> 09:27.131
Fiona.

09:32.397 --> 09:33.790
You all right there, Benjamin?

09:36.488 --> 09:40.188
Manchester!
Tell me where you are.

09:40.231 --> 09:41.493
I feel you.

09:49.240 --> 09:50.372
You all right?

09:51.373 --> 09:52.679
Is it the tea?

09:52.722 --> 09:55.899
Nah,
the tea's brilliant. Thanks.

09:57.509 --> 09:59.947
And, uh, well, look, all gone.

09:59.990 --> 10:02.253
Um, shall I walk you out?

10:04.255 --> 10:05.779
Yeah, I suppose so.

10:05.822 --> 10:09.826
-It was lovely to meet you.
-You, too, Lydia. Thank you.

10:12.568 --> 10:13.961
Great cuppa.

10:19.053 --> 10:20.315
Hey.

10:22.534 --> 10:26.060
Okay, you want me, you got me.
Just... Just let her go.

10:26.103 --> 10:28.410
But she's the guest of honor.

10:28.453 --> 10:31.195
Now, play nice.

10:32.109 --> 10:33.110
Go on.

10:34.590 --> 10:36.113
Easy, easy.

10:36.157 --> 10:38.072
Hey, Lydia,
you mind grabbing
some more tea?

10:38.115 --> 10:40.248
I think
Manchester's gonna stay
just a little bit longer.

10:40.291 --> 10:42.250
Oh. Yeah, sure.

10:44.905 --> 10:48.038
Say anything
and she dies screaming.

10:53.348 --> 10:55.611
-Kara.
-I know you want
to be left alone

10:55.655 --> 11:00.007
and I will absolutely do that
after you hear me out,

11:00.050 --> 11:02.400
because I think
I need your help.

11:03.706 --> 11:05.447
And I think you need mine.

11:09.625 --> 11:11.018
Thank you.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.067
My family is from...

11:18.416 --> 11:19.504
Far away.

11:19.548 --> 11:20.636
It's okay.

11:25.162 --> 11:27.774
They're from
a planet called Naltor.

11:27.817 --> 11:29.384
Wow, that's...

11:31.038 --> 11:33.083
You know you could
have told me, right?

11:33.127 --> 11:36.826
I mean, I know it's not
the best time to broadcast
that you're an alien, but--

11:36.870 --> 11:40.047
I know myself
really, really well.

11:40.090 --> 11:43.354
Always have.
But once in a generation,

11:43.398 --> 11:48.620
some of our women
get this genetic oneiromancy.

11:51.014 --> 11:52.624
They can dream the future.

11:53.974 --> 11:55.976
And you can do that?

11:56.019 --> 11:57.673
My dreams
aren't like you think.

11:57.717 --> 12:00.807
I can't control what I see.

12:00.850 --> 12:04.767
Most of the time,
I don't even know what's
going on in my dreams,

12:04.811 --> 12:08.031
and when I do,
it's terrifying.

12:12.819 --> 12:16.561
Last time I saw Agent Liberty

12:17.606 --> 12:19.434
about to murder a woman.

12:20.957 --> 12:23.351
Did you recognize her?

12:23.394 --> 12:25.875
Do you know when he's
going to do it or where?

12:25.919 --> 12:27.616
That's what
I'm trying to tell you.

12:28.835 --> 12:30.445
If I could help, I would.

12:31.272 --> 12:35.667
Really, I would. But I can't.

12:35.711 --> 12:39.628
Well, what if I told you
that I know someone
that could help you?

12:40.629 --> 12:42.109
I would welcome the help.

12:42.892 --> 12:44.198
Great.

12:45.199 --> 12:46.766
Your help is welcomed.

12:49.551 --> 12:51.248
-Hey, girl.

12:52.684 --> 12:53.729
Oh!

12:53.773 --> 12:55.426
I'm okay.

12:55.470 --> 12:58.516
Can I ask you,
how do you know
so much about me?

12:58.560 --> 13:01.345
-Well, I'm a 12th level--
-He's really smart.

13:02.259 --> 13:03.434
Oh.

13:03.478 --> 13:05.828
All you need to know
is that what you see

13:05.872 --> 13:08.526
isn't necessarily
what will be.

13:08.570 --> 13:12.269
Hence,
the need for exploration
and interpretation.

13:13.009 --> 13:15.882
But that is why I'm here.

13:15.925 --> 13:19.146
So, you have nothing
to worry about, Nura.

13:20.451 --> 13:22.932
-No.

13:22.976 --> 13:25.979
I didn't. Did...
Did you call her Nura?

13:26.022 --> 13:27.458
She didn't.

13:30.331 --> 13:31.332
Now...

13:33.987 --> 13:37.338
Listen to Kara's voice
and count backwards.

13:39.427 --> 13:43.213
Three, two, one.

13:45.520 --> 13:47.609
-I'm here.

13:52.353 --> 13:53.571
A hook.

13:54.877 --> 13:56.792
It's one of those
loady type hooks.

13:57.749 --> 13:59.534
It was in the dream last time.

13:59.577 --> 14:01.101
Do you see anything new?

14:01.928 --> 14:03.712
I don't know.

14:03.755 --> 14:06.454
She needs to relax.
-Nia, it's okay. It's okay.

14:06.497 --> 14:09.761
Just relax, and remember,
this is your dream.

14:13.156 --> 14:14.636
She's back.

14:15.419 --> 14:16.551
The woman...

14:18.031 --> 14:19.554
She's shaking.

14:20.424 --> 14:21.556
It's awful.

14:27.214 --> 14:28.737
I think
I just slowed her down.

14:30.086 --> 14:31.653
I can stop the shaking.

14:31.696 --> 14:34.395
She's already
modulating her dreaming.

14:34.438 --> 14:36.788
That... That's great, Nia.
That's great.

14:36.832 --> 14:40.575
After this,
I'm really gonna have
some follow-up questions.

14:40.618 --> 14:44.796
Stop,
put the gun down. Please,
just put the gun down.

14:44.840 --> 14:47.756
You're scaring me.
Please, put the gun down.

14:47.799 --> 14:51.760
Stop! I said...
Please, stop. Please, stop.

14:51.803 --> 14:53.544
Put it down!

14:53.588 --> 14:56.504
-There's somebody else here.
-She needs to move toward it.

14:57.853 --> 14:59.811
It's Liberty.

14:59.855 --> 15:00.900
Kara, I want to get out.

15:00.943 --> 15:03.903
Count forwards. One, two--

15:03.946 --> 15:06.644
-I want to get out now!
-Three.

15:06.688 --> 15:08.820
-Hey, we're here. You're safe.

15:11.867 --> 15:13.260
But that woman isn't.

15:16.002 --> 15:17.394
And I know
where we need to go.

15:24.358 --> 15:26.273
Welcome to Collinwood.

15:27.187 --> 15:28.840
It doesn't seem so bad.

15:28.884 --> 15:31.365
Oh, yes. What could go wrong?

15:37.023 --> 15:40.983
And this is the end
of the Lockwood home
five-cent tour.

15:41.027 --> 15:46.293
Ah, well, Lydia, Benjamin,
you have a lovely home.

15:46.336 --> 15:48.469
So, I've got tons of work
I need to catch up on.

15:48.512 --> 15:49.992
-I would be--

15:50.036 --> 15:54.431
Oh, Ben's
great-great-great-grandfather
made those.

15:55.302 --> 15:57.478
Yeah. He was a blacksmith.

15:57.521 --> 15:59.219
That bayonet is the...

15:59.262 --> 16:02.048
Well, it's one
of the first things
the Lockwoods ever forged.

16:02.091 --> 16:03.701
It's from
the American Revolution.

16:04.659 --> 16:05.877
Is it, really?

16:07.183 --> 16:08.576
Can I?

16:10.186 --> 16:11.448
So...

16:15.104 --> 16:18.455
You know,
it's from Bunker Hill.

16:19.369 --> 16:20.849
Remember that one?

16:20.892 --> 16:22.590
It's the one where the Brits,
uh, thought they had won,

16:22.633 --> 16:25.462
but the battle
ended up so bloody,
that it cost them the war,

16:25.506 --> 16:27.160
and it wasn't worth it.

16:27.203 --> 16:28.857
Bloody is right.

16:28.900 --> 16:31.207
I mean, can you imagine
sticking this into a bloke

16:31.251 --> 16:32.426
and then
twisting it in his guts?

16:32.469 --> 16:34.471
-That's graphic.
-Graphic.

16:35.646 --> 16:36.647
It is.

16:37.039 --> 16:38.301
"Lockwood."

16:38.954 --> 16:41.304
It's a fine piece.

16:41.348 --> 16:44.046
You ever wish your husband
was a steel man, Lydia?

16:44.090 --> 16:45.874
Stop it.

16:45.917 --> 16:48.007
Of course, that's not
really the family business
anymore, is it?

16:48.050 --> 16:51.053
Now you lot just dress up
in wicked metal masks.

16:51.097 --> 16:53.055
Isn't that right...

16:53.099 --> 16:54.578
Agent Liberty?

16:54.622 --> 16:56.885
-Ben, what is
he talking about?

16:56.928 --> 16:59.757
Okay. Listen, I've never
seen you before in my life,

16:59.801 --> 17:02.543
and I'm not whoever it is
that you say that I am.

17:02.586 --> 17:04.327
Manchester.

17:05.241 --> 17:06.982
Manchester, tell me
where you are.

17:10.768 --> 17:13.119
-Get out of my head.
-You made a promise.

17:13.162 --> 17:14.859
That promise died with Fiona.

17:14.903 --> 17:16.818
But it didn't die with me.

17:16.861 --> 17:21.127
If you can't hold yourself
to that promise, I will.

17:21.170 --> 17:22.476
What?

17:23.999 --> 17:26.349
I feel your pain, Manchester.

17:26.393 --> 17:27.742
Give this up.

17:30.266 --> 17:31.702
You want to feel my pain?

17:36.316 --> 17:37.795
Feel it.

17:46.891 --> 17:49.329
You're insane!
He is not Agent Liberty!

17:49.372 --> 17:51.026
Do you bet your life
on that, Lydia?

17:52.941 --> 17:57.772
Somewhere in your
perfect little house,

17:57.815 --> 18:00.644
there is
a silly costume he puts on
to go do terrorism.

18:03.865 --> 18:05.519
Show me that mask.

18:05.562 --> 18:08.174
In retrospect, it makes sense
that more than one person

18:08.217 --> 18:10.045
would have run
the Collinwood 5K.

18:11.220 --> 18:13.222
Do you recognize anything?

18:13.266 --> 18:14.963
No.

18:15.006 --> 18:16.312
All I saw in my dream

18:16.356 --> 18:20.795
was the woman,
the shadow, and the hook.

18:22.188 --> 18:25.365
Do you think we should
be looking for some kind
of construction site?

18:25.408 --> 18:28.237
No. What you saw
were probably symbols.

18:28.281 --> 18:29.891
Jungian, Freudian.

18:29.934 --> 18:32.502
Where I'm from,
we call them Frungian.

18:32.546 --> 18:35.070
-I'm sorry.
-No. No, Nia. Don't be sorry.

18:35.114 --> 18:38.639
We're on the right track.
This is... This is good.

18:38.682 --> 18:43.600
Although I do sense
some hostility
from the locals.

18:43.644 --> 18:45.776
Hmm. Not unexpected.

18:45.820 --> 18:47.735
My scan of regional data
revealed Collinwood

18:47.778 --> 18:50.651
as an early center
for anti-alien activity.

18:50.694 --> 18:52.566
It does feel a little Purge-y.

18:52.609 --> 18:53.871
James DeMonaco, 2013.

18:53.915 --> 18:55.873
I thought you were
just watching the classics.

18:55.917 --> 18:59.050
-Let me talk to you for a sec.
Just a minute.

18:59.094 --> 19:00.095
Oh, of course.

19:01.879 --> 19:03.664
Don't look now,

19:03.707 --> 19:08.756
but these, uh, fine folks
over here with
the alien-sniffing dog,

19:09.757 --> 19:12.977
-they've been following us.
Where?

19:13.021 --> 19:15.415
-No! Stop it! Stop! I told...

19:15.458 --> 19:17.156
I think they're
Children of Liberty.

19:21.464 --> 19:23.945
-Presumptuous.
-I X-ray'd them,

19:23.988 --> 19:28.210
and they've got guns,
and the woman has
a metal mask in her purse.

19:28.254 --> 19:31.909
-Problematic.
-Or it could be perfect.

19:31.953 --> 19:33.824
Instead of wandering
around the city

19:33.868 --> 19:36.871
looking for the girl
in Nia's dream,

19:36.914 --> 19:41.745
instead, why don't we
just find the guy
who's going to attack her?

19:41.789 --> 19:43.225
-Agent Liberty.
-Yes.

19:43.269 --> 19:45.662
He's here, or he will be soon.

19:45.706 --> 19:49.840
And maybe these three
can lead us to him. Hmm?

19:51.233 --> 19:53.235
Chicanery! Very good.

19:53.279 --> 19:56.717
I'll distract Nia while you
catfish our new friends.

19:56.760 --> 20:00.547
Hail me after.
Look, Nia, a crafts store.

20:00.590 --> 20:02.853
Have you been introduced
to the magic of lanyards?

20:02.897 --> 20:04.768
-Hello! Hi.

20:06.161 --> 20:08.163
Um, I was wondering
if you guys could help me.

20:08.207 --> 20:12.863
I just did one
of those 23andMe tests.
That's, you know, the DNA?

20:14.474 --> 20:19.218
Anyway, my real name
is Kara Liberty,

20:21.132 --> 20:23.961
so I'm here
searching for my birth dad.

20:26.268 --> 20:27.617
Agent.

20:27.661 --> 20:29.489
-Agent Liberty.

20:29.532 --> 20:32.666
He's... He's around here
somewhere, am I right?

20:34.537 --> 20:35.843
What a cute dog.

20:38.628 --> 20:40.804
He's, uh, friendly.

20:40.848 --> 20:43.590
Uh, double diamond lanyards.

20:43.633 --> 20:47.333
My, aren't these
lanyards compelling

20:48.595 --> 20:49.639
This is happening so fast.

20:49.683 --> 20:51.467
They're attacking Kara!

20:51.511 --> 20:53.382
-Nia. Nia!
-Let her go!

20:53.426 --> 20:56.690
-Nia, no!
-This is problematic.

21:00.563 --> 21:03.174
You really don't have to do
this, you can just...

21:05.655 --> 21:09.311
-It's going to be all right.
We've been kidnapped.

21:09.355 --> 21:12.749
Reporting 101.
When you get kidnapped,
you're on the right track.

21:12.793 --> 21:14.229
But that doesn't
make any sense.

21:14.273 --> 21:15.578
Tell that to Lois Lane.

21:15.622 --> 21:17.319
It's simple.

21:17.363 --> 21:20.409
We bide our time,
and then spring into action
using our super...

21:21.976 --> 21:24.021
Kung fu.

21:24.065 --> 21:28.112
In which we have many belts
in an aggressive rainbow
of colors.

21:29.157 --> 21:30.158
Mmm-hmm.

21:31.768 --> 21:32.987
Our plan is working.

21:33.596 --> 21:34.989
Do you see this?

21:35.032 --> 21:37.992
They have weapons everywhere.
Equipment.

21:38.035 --> 21:39.472
This is textbook bad guy lair.

21:39.515 --> 21:40.777
Shh.

21:41.517 --> 21:42.823
We should talk to him.

21:42.866 --> 21:44.172
Do you want to tell
Agent Liberty

21:44.215 --> 21:46.000
we brought reporters
to his clubhouse?

21:47.436 --> 21:48.742
Whose call was that?

21:48.785 --> 21:50.178
They've got to die.

22:03.800 --> 22:06.020
Kara! Brainy!

22:40.707 --> 22:42.143
Got words for him?

22:42.839 --> 22:44.058
He's a killer, you know.

22:44.711 --> 22:45.929
Yeah.

22:46.843 --> 22:50.369
Murdered the love
of my whole, wasted life.

22:51.979 --> 22:53.807
Please tell me
this isn't true.

22:55.374 --> 22:57.158
I'm so sorry.

23:01.075 --> 23:03.207
It was done, it was finished.
I was going to stop.

23:04.644 --> 23:07.124
-Put the suit on.

23:07.168 --> 23:10.127
I want you to die
doing what you love.

23:10.171 --> 23:13.348
No, please, no.
-Now!

23:20.399 --> 23:22.444
That was amazing.

23:22.488 --> 23:25.273
That... That thing you did
with the bullet and the cuffs,
how did you do that?

23:25.316 --> 23:27.231
I don't know.
It was like a reflex.

23:27.275 --> 23:29.930
I... I saw the moment
before the gunshot.

23:29.973 --> 23:31.584
The power's never worked
like that before.

23:31.627 --> 23:33.281
I just knew
what to do.

23:33.324 --> 23:35.283
I guess that makes sense.
Our powers are like muscles.

23:35.326 --> 23:37.633
The more we use them,
the stronger they get.

23:37.677 --> 23:40.288
Or so I've been told.

23:40.331 --> 23:43.987
Just one problem,
our only leads
are still unconscious.

23:47.730 --> 23:48.992
Wait.

23:52.866 --> 23:55.129
This says
"Lockwood Family Steel."

23:57.087 --> 23:59.002
-You think Lockwood as in--

23:59.568 --> 24:01.135
Phone, please.

24:05.269 --> 24:08.447
Ben Lockwood's family company,
Lockwood Family Steel,

24:08.490 --> 24:10.492
went bankrupt shortly after
the terraforming events

24:10.536 --> 24:14.017
which destroyed this factory
and killed Ben's father.

24:17.978 --> 24:20.067
I'm gonna get help.

24:22.199 --> 24:24.114
Brainy, Nia and I
are in Collinwood,

24:24.158 --> 24:26.073
where we ran into
a bunch of
Children of Liberty.

24:26.116 --> 24:28.641
Are you okay?
Of course you're okay.

24:28.684 --> 24:32.775
They took us to this factory,
and it has weapons
and supplies,

24:32.819 --> 24:34.298
war room stuff.

24:34.342 --> 24:37.301
But guess who the factory
belonged to first?

24:37.345 --> 24:38.346
Ben Lockwood.

24:39.565 --> 24:40.783
-Do you think
there is a chance

24:40.827 --> 24:42.263
he might be Agent Liberty?

24:45.527 --> 24:46.963
Well, let's find out.

24:49.009 --> 24:51.707
Hi, Frank.
Uh, the plea deal's
off the table.

24:51.751 --> 24:53.187
What

24:53.230 --> 24:55.668
It was for your cooperation,
but now we don't need it.

24:55.711 --> 24:57.321
We know that
Lockwood is Agent Liberty.

24:58.366 --> 25:00.150
Lockwood

25:00.194 --> 25:02.631
Oh, so, you're still
siding with him.
He's still siding with him.

25:02.675 --> 25:03.893
Who are you talking to?

25:03.937 --> 25:05.634
Um, listen.
You know what,
that's fine.

25:05.678 --> 25:07.331
But if you change your mind,
just give me a call

25:07.375 --> 25:09.377
from whatever black site
they send you to.

25:11.684 --> 25:12.902
Wait.

25:17.559 --> 25:18.734
It's him.

25:18.778 --> 25:21.215
-We got the bastard.

25:23.522 --> 25:25.219
Stop!

25:27.700 --> 25:29.310
-Come on, get up.

25:29.353 --> 25:30.354
Ben.

25:32.922 --> 25:35.142
All dressed up
for his funeral.

25:37.187 --> 25:38.972
When this is over,
they're going to need dental
records to ID your body.

25:42.497 --> 25:44.194
Stand back, stand back.

25:44.238 --> 25:46.675
It could be a lot worse.
We could go Biblical,
eye for an eye.

25:47.720 --> 25:51.071
You killed Fiona, I kill her.

25:53.552 --> 25:55.205
You feel that?

25:55.249 --> 25:57.251
That's what it's like
when you're about
to lose everything.

26:00.297 --> 26:03.213
What do you want, J'onn?
You're not going to
talk me down.

26:03.257 --> 26:06.695
I know. And I'm sorry.

26:07.957 --> 26:09.742
-You leave me no choice.

26:19.795 --> 26:23.103
You're right.
Because I'll never stop.

26:23.930 --> 26:26.062
Not unless you kill me.

26:26.106 --> 26:29.239
Go on. Go on. I dare you.
You know you can do it.

26:33.679 --> 26:36.333
-No.

26:49.956 --> 26:51.305
-Run!

27:00.314 --> 27:02.621
Shouldn't have done that.

27:39.005 --> 27:40.441
Lockwood?

27:52.627 --> 27:55.064
Supergirl.

27:55.108 --> 27:56.849
Manchester's on the warpath.

27:56.892 --> 27:59.373
I couldn't see for certain,
but I think
he has Agent Liberty.

27:59.895 --> 28:01.462
I'll find them.

28:18.174 --> 28:19.872
I told you to wait for Kara.

28:21.830 --> 28:24.224
Fine. We stick together.

28:27.140 --> 28:28.750
I saw them come through here.

28:30.883 --> 28:33.189
-Nith metal.
-Nth metal.

28:33.233 --> 28:36.062
Strongest element
in existence.

28:36.105 --> 28:37.716
There's a bit of it in this.

28:39.021 --> 28:40.631
I thought
that was a class ring.

28:41.371 --> 28:42.590
I was home-schooled.

28:44.157 --> 28:45.898
Well-- Wait.

28:48.814 --> 28:49.771
This is it.

28:52.295 --> 28:54.254
This is the place
from my dreams.

28:56.473 --> 28:57.648
It's all going to happen.

29:00.042 --> 29:04.830
Nia Nal,
you contain greatness.

29:06.962 --> 29:11.488
I can't tell you how I know,
but we can stop this.

29:12.663 --> 29:15.275
You can stop this.

29:16.319 --> 29:17.712
I can stop this.

29:19.758 --> 29:20.802
I can stop this.

29:27.940 --> 29:30.203
You saw something,
something... Something more.

29:30.246 --> 29:32.509
Brainy, we need
to get back outside.

29:32.553 --> 29:36.426
Benjamin Lockwood!
Come and get
your medicine, lad.

29:41.910 --> 29:44.347
Now then, I suppose
the requisite question is...

29:45.218 --> 29:46.567
Any last words?

29:50.963 --> 29:53.661
I came here to stop him.
Don't make me stop you.

29:53.704 --> 29:56.533
Is this the part
where you tell me violence
won't change anything?

30:05.891 --> 30:07.631
What... What...

30:07.675 --> 30:10.025
-It's moondust.

30:10.069 --> 30:12.071
Sharp enough
to cut Kryptonian DNA.

30:12.114 --> 30:13.681
Oh, nasty.

30:13.724 --> 30:16.510
You just got a lungful
from one of them alien moons.

30:16.553 --> 30:18.642
Part of it's honed
to a nanometer.

30:18.686 --> 30:21.341
I bet you're just a bit softer
on the inside.

30:22.211 --> 30:24.866
If you kill him,
what does that make you?

30:26.085 --> 30:27.651
The intolerant left.

30:27.695 --> 30:30.567
If we want to win this,
we have to be better.

30:32.047 --> 30:35.703
Let me take him to prison,
show people who he really is.

30:35.746 --> 30:36.965
Don't be daft!

30:37.009 --> 30:38.924
Those people hate you!

30:38.967 --> 30:41.404
You can put a cape on,
say you're a superhero,

30:41.448 --> 30:42.928
but to him and everyone else
like him,

30:42.971 --> 30:44.538
you'll only ever be an alien.

30:46.757 --> 30:47.802
A roach!

30:59.205 --> 31:01.772
Time to pick a side,
Pollyanna.

31:01.816 --> 31:05.559
You're with them,
government stooge,
Happy Meal hero,

31:05.602 --> 31:08.823
or you're with me,
and we string up the lot.

31:08.867 --> 31:12.305
Every terrorist turning
your streets into war zones.

31:12.348 --> 31:14.785
You keep saying
it's a never-ending battle.

31:14.829 --> 31:18.528
How about you and I
end it together?

31:19.442 --> 31:20.966
I'll never be like you.

31:41.160 --> 31:42.944
What is it

31:51.997 --> 31:52.998
Supergirl.

31:55.391 --> 31:57.480
Lydia!

31:57.524 --> 32:00.266
-Ben!
-Sweetheart,
you can't be here.

32:00.309 --> 32:01.745
-We have to--

32:02.224 --> 32:03.922
Well, well.

32:04.444 --> 32:05.749
No!

32:16.891 --> 32:17.936
Hook.

32:18.501 --> 32:20.634
Spielberg. 1991.

32:21.896 --> 32:22.941
Are you hurt?

32:22.984 --> 32:24.246
I'm all right,
I'm okay.

32:24.290 --> 32:25.900
We--
We've got to get out of here.

32:28.381 --> 32:29.904
Ben?

32:30.296 --> 32:31.906
Ben. Ben?

32:33.255 --> 32:34.735
Ben, stop!

32:35.431 --> 32:36.824
Ben, don't!

32:37.564 --> 32:38.913
Ben, put the gun down!

32:43.483 --> 32:45.746
That's Nth metal, Supergirl!

32:47.574 --> 32:49.837
-No point struggling.
-I'm not struggling.

32:51.186 --> 32:52.753
I'm flying!

33:20.346 --> 33:21.782
Miss Nal, right?

33:23.001 --> 33:24.045
Nice work.

33:24.089 --> 33:25.481
Thank you.

33:43.195 --> 33:44.718
Think it's over?

33:44.761 --> 33:46.850
I think it's a start.

33:46.894 --> 33:49.027
Now people will see
who he really is.

33:49.070 --> 33:50.115
Small.

33:51.681 --> 33:54.597
He's not a movement,
he's a butcher.

33:55.511 --> 33:56.904
And now,
he's gonna pay for it.

33:58.558 --> 34:00.212
Have either of you seen Kara?

34:01.648 --> 34:03.650
-Uh, yeah.
-I think she--

34:03.693 --> 34:05.260
Any comment--

34:05.304 --> 34:07.654
I don't know. Look at my face.
Look what they did to me.

34:07.697 --> 34:10.918
Now, I wore that mask
to protect me and my family

34:10.961 --> 34:14.008
because there are aliens
who don't like to hear
what I believe,

34:14.052 --> 34:17.011
don't like to hear the truth,
so I'm cards up.

34:17.055 --> 34:21.059
What about Supergirl, huh?
You know who I am. Who is she?

34:43.211 --> 34:44.647
Why are you here?

34:45.344 --> 34:47.085
Huh?

34:47.128 --> 34:49.261
Both times you let me
go on my merry.

34:51.089 --> 34:52.699
Both times
I've gone on to do...

34:52.742 --> 34:55.876
Well, let's call it
unspeakable things.

34:55.919 --> 35:00.315
So my theory is part of you
wanted me to get away.

35:01.751 --> 35:04.102
Part of you wanted me to do
what you couldn't.

35:04.624 --> 35:05.842
You're wrong.

35:05.886 --> 35:08.236
Ah, 'cause you want
to be a bloody saint.

35:08.280 --> 35:10.630
'Cause you ain't gonna study
war no more, yeah?

35:10.673 --> 35:12.066
You think that's a weakness?

35:12.110 --> 35:13.894
I think
it's a character defect.

35:13.937 --> 35:16.114
Couple of weeks ago,
you had that same defect.

35:18.377 --> 35:19.987
But maybe that's my curse,

35:21.075 --> 35:22.729
believing in people
who don't deserve it.

35:22.772 --> 35:25.123
You think my soul's
still up for grabs, old man?

35:25.601 --> 35:26.863
Yes, I do.

35:33.479 --> 35:34.958
And I think you do, too.

35:45.404 --> 35:47.101
Supergirl really got him.

35:47.145 --> 35:49.147
It's gonna be hard
for Lockwood
to come off reasonable

35:49.190 --> 35:51.758
now that everyone knows
he's a psycho in a mask.

35:59.635 --> 36:02.464
Colonel Haley,
Director Danvers.

36:05.467 --> 36:07.904
-Hello, Supergirl.
-President Baker.

36:11.081 --> 36:14.041
"Human rights activist
imprisoned."

36:16.478 --> 36:18.306
Their words, not mine.

36:18.350 --> 36:20.743
"Human rights"?
-Yeah, a lot of people,

36:20.787 --> 36:25.226
lot of donors are asking
how can we tolerate this

36:25.270 --> 36:29.970
in a government that is
supposed to be for the people.

36:30.013 --> 36:32.190
That meant to imply
that aliens aren't?

36:34.017 --> 36:36.281
-People, sir.

36:36.324 --> 36:38.108
Of course not.

36:38.152 --> 36:41.068
But you are a government
employee, like me.

36:42.025 --> 36:44.332
And, as such,
we need to make sure

36:44.376 --> 36:47.901
that we are serving all of
the people of this country,

36:47.944 --> 36:49.816
not just the ones
we agree with.

36:49.859 --> 36:51.992
For reasons of national
security, from now on,

36:52.035 --> 36:56.736
the DEO will require
full transparency
from its assets.

36:58.128 --> 37:00.348
We need to know
your secret identity,
Supergirl.

37:02.742 --> 37:05.832
No. We keep her
off the books for a reason.

37:05.875 --> 37:08.226
-She can't tell you that, sir.

37:09.357 --> 37:12.665
Lockwood just shined
a huge spotlight on the fact

37:12.708 --> 37:15.015
that you are withholding
who you really are.

37:16.277 --> 37:19.454
Now, keeping that secret
inflames things.

37:19.498 --> 37:23.023
Gives the public
more reasons to distrust you
and my government.

37:23.066 --> 37:25.068
If I did that, sir,
everyone I know,

37:25.112 --> 37:27.245
everyone I love
would be at risk.

37:30.944 --> 37:34.948
My family
is with the Secret Service
as we speak.

37:35.775 --> 37:38.038
You think
they're not in danger?

37:38.081 --> 37:41.041
No one should be
above the rest of us.

37:42.564 --> 37:44.305
We need to put country first.

38:00.147 --> 38:02.454
I'm sorry, sir.
I can't give you
what you want.

38:08.111 --> 38:10.113
Then, I thank you
for your service,

38:11.245 --> 38:13.291
but you're dismissed,
effective immediately.

38:16.990 --> 38:19.949
I hope you'll comply.

38:19.993 --> 38:22.778
The United States
does not want
a war with Supergirl.

38:22.822 --> 38:24.476
Then I trust
you won't start one.

38:35.617 --> 38:39.142
Okay, just give me some time.
They'll come around.

38:39.186 --> 38:42.320
Protect this place
and everything it stands for.

38:59.075 --> 39:01.251
-[people shouting
indistinctly on TV]
Thanks, Jim.

39:01.295 --> 39:03.384
We are standing outside
the county jail
where Ben Lockwood

39:03.428 --> 39:06.996
aka Agent Liberty,
has been remanded
into custody.

39:07.040 --> 39:08.650
What are they protesting?

39:08.694 --> 39:10.130
Protesters have been massing outside the jail

39:10.173 --> 39:11.436
-for the last several hours...
-Us.

39:11.479 --> 39:13.133
...and have
blocked off roads...

40:01.573 --> 40:02.574
Liberty.

40:04.880 --> 40:06.229
Liberty.

40:06.273 --> 40:10.408
Liberty.
Liberty. Liberty.

40:10.451 --> 40:13.715
-Liberty. Liberty. Liberty.
-See you soon.

40:13.759 --> 40:17.066
Liberty. Liberty. Liberty.

40:17.110 --> 40:20.635
Liberty. Liberty. Liberty.

41:27.702 --> 41:28.834
You failed.

41:34.013 --> 41:35.623
Why are you doing this?

41:36.363 --> 41:38.191
You did this to yourself.

41:39.366 --> 41:43.152
And now,
all of you will perish.
