WEBVTT

00:02.347 --> 00:04.206
Harry?

00:04.271 --> 00:06.876
You know, I was actually quite
nervous about meeting you, Harry,

00:06.930 --> 00:09.402
but I suppose this has
broken the ice?

00:09.479 --> 00:11.441
I saw the bracelet on her wrist, Harry.

00:11.476 --> 00:14.555
Did she get to you? Is that
it? Do you get lucky together?

00:14.590 --> 00:16.606
Well, she's fun, at least.

00:16.641 --> 00:18.699
Come on, Rich, I did what
you asked, I kept my distance.

00:18.723 --> 00:20.232
And yet here you are.

00:20.267 --> 00:22.307
Cos I miss you. I miss my brother.

00:22.396 --> 00:24.417
Steve won't be running anything.

00:24.493 --> 00:27.533
He's been reduced to the
rank of detective constable

00:27.615 --> 00:29.199
with immediate effect.

00:29.284 --> 00:31.494
There's a second bracelet and
I know the woman who wears it.

00:31.518 --> 00:32.905
She's stronger than he is.

00:33.002 --> 00:35.774
That selfish little bitch
just sabotaged your life.

00:35.808 --> 00:38.570
- Right now, I don't care.
- But you will.

00:38.605 --> 00:40.323
I had two children.

00:40.358 --> 00:42.887
Two beautiful baby girls.

00:42.983 --> 00:45.503
Dead, because of her.

00:45.655 --> 00:46.694
Bastard!

00:48.219 --> 00:49.699
Bastard!

00:49.820 --> 00:52.754
- It's what you've always wanted.
- Harry, she'll hurt you.

00:52.820 --> 00:55.144
He knows you're my torch. He
knows all the lies you told.

00:55.207 --> 00:56.720
- Harry, I...
- She's right.

00:56.755 --> 00:58.385
You got what you want from me.

00:58.420 --> 01:00.772
<i>You have to start
trusting me. You have to.</i>

01:14.365 --> 01:15.899
I know a shortcut.

01:18.892 --> 01:21.612
You know, I thought this was a shortcut.

01:21.647 --> 01:22.647
Really?

01:29.237 --> 01:30.383
Get your hands up!

01:31.240 --> 01:32.427
Both of you!

01:34.715 --> 01:36.435
Come on, put your hands up!

01:45.235 --> 01:46.447
Get out my way!

01:47.290 --> 01:49.440
- Move!
- I've danced with the devil.

01:49.475 --> 01:50.635
What?

01:50.724 --> 01:54.107
I'm not scared, pal, but I know you are.

01:58.489 --> 01:59.509
Eurgh!

02:01.060 --> 02:03.551
Now, what shall we do with him?

03:12.194 --> 03:13.994
Why did you give me that knife?

03:16.617 --> 03:18.786
To kill Golding, of course.

03:19.847 --> 03:22.193
It was what you'd always wanted.

03:22.287 --> 03:23.700
Why would you help me?

03:23.858 --> 03:25.378
Because I'm your friend.

03:27.759 --> 03:28.947
Was.

03:29.437 --> 03:31.745
It's a wonderful feeling, revenge.

03:31.818 --> 03:33.818
I'm sorry you missed out on it.

03:34.106 --> 03:37.722
To see what it felt like
to be like me for a day.

03:37.757 --> 03:39.637
To be corrupt?

03:39.722 --> 03:41.082
To hurt?

03:41.360 --> 03:45.217
To feel trapped and know
that you can never escape.

03:45.880 --> 03:47.256
I didn't kill your girls.

03:47.291 --> 03:48.837
Yes, you did.

03:48.910 --> 03:52.299
I tried to warn you over and
over and you wouldn't listen.

03:52.371 --> 03:56.851
As soon as you put this on
me, you dug their graves.

03:56.965 --> 03:59.337
It was inevitable.

03:59.445 --> 04:01.306
Just like it is for Harry.

04:01.984 --> 04:04.802
This bracelet will drag him down.

04:04.869 --> 04:06.767
- I won't let it.
- How?

04:08.039 --> 04:10.739
If you warn him or tell him the truth...

04:12.559 --> 04:14.386
he will never forgive you.

04:18.041 --> 04:20.620
I miss you sometimes.

04:20.695 --> 04:23.055
I dream of how we used to be.

04:26.296 --> 04:29.991
And then I wake up and I
imagine cutting out your eyes.

04:37.225 --> 04:39.707
A prototype driverless car...

04:39.783 --> 04:41.834
it was being taken on a public test drive

04:41.872 --> 04:44.688
at a launch event yesterday
when it went out of control

04:44.723 --> 04:46.453
and drove into the water.

04:46.564 --> 04:49.072
The future, and it ends up in the Thames.

04:50.255 --> 04:52.685
Bloody sat navs. Who's the deceased?

04:52.723 --> 04:56.716
Mary Wells, the wife of the
car's developer, Davey Wells.

04:56.817 --> 04:58.724
And why are we here? It's an accident?

04:58.759 --> 05:02.035
The Health and Safety Inspectorate
spotted this and called us.

05:02.101 --> 05:06.421
The barrier where the car went in
could have been weakened beforehand.

05:07.821 --> 05:09.483
Or it could be a coincidence.

05:10.060 --> 05:13.550
<i>We are leaders in the
field of driverless technology.</i>

05:13.613 --> 05:15.363
This is a compilation of mobile footage

05:15.398 --> 05:18.224
taken at the launch of the driverless car.

05:18.309 --> 05:20.030
That's Davey Wells.

05:22.125 --> 05:25.035
<i>Now, who better to join me on
this, the first public test drive</i>

05:25.085 --> 05:27.608
<i>of our completely
autonomous vehicle,</i>

05:28.401 --> 05:31.391
<i>than my beautiful wife, Mary?</i>

05:35.926 --> 05:38.206
The car's complex
computer and sensory system

05:38.241 --> 05:40.477
allows the car to navigate itself.

05:41.769 --> 05:47.024
There he is taking the
deceased, Mary Wells, for a joy ride.

05:52.170 --> 05:54.235
Any footage of when
things start to go wrong?

06:01.873 --> 06:05.860
So, he takes a call at the exact
moment the car malfunctions.

06:05.918 --> 06:07.798
- Another coincidence?
- Could be.

06:08.263 --> 06:10.423
God.

06:12.687 --> 06:14.429
Bloody hell!

06:14.541 --> 06:16.854
See if Digital Forensics
can trace the call.

06:16.940 --> 06:18.951
Will do. So, who is she?

06:18.986 --> 06:22.515
- Who? What?
- The woman whose perfume you stink of.

06:22.550 --> 06:23.961
No idea what you're on about.

06:25.337 --> 06:28.515
Where was Davey Wells when we were
fishing his wife out of the dock?

06:31.052 --> 06:33.517
Davey Wells is a wealthy entrepreneur,

06:33.622 --> 06:36.302
likes to invest in
cutting-edge tech companies.

06:42.721 --> 06:44.538
- DI Clayton?
- Yes?

06:44.573 --> 06:46.230
Lakshi Perera.

06:46.461 --> 06:47.739
I'm Mr. Wells' head of legal.

06:47.794 --> 06:49.580
- Is he here?
- I'm afraid not.

06:49.644 --> 06:50.570
He's not at home, either.

06:50.605 --> 06:52.636
Mr. Wells has been
through a terrible ordeal.

06:52.671 --> 06:55.393
He's simply in no fit state to
answer questions at the moment.

06:55.455 --> 06:57.433
I'm sorry, but you
don't get to decide that.

06:57.501 --> 06:59.355
I want a list of all the
attendees at the launch

06:59.379 --> 07:01.530
- and a schedule for the event.
- I'll see what I can do.

07:01.554 --> 07:03.486
I assume you're carrying
out an internal investigation

07:03.510 --> 07:05.035
- into the crash.
- Of course.

07:05.093 --> 07:09.052
We're working closely with the company
that developed the computer systems.

07:09.126 --> 07:10.667
We'll keep you informed of our progress.

07:10.691 --> 07:12.165
We'll do our own investigation, thanks.

07:12.189 --> 07:14.456
- What's the name of the company?
- Spikesy.

07:14.508 --> 07:16.356
They're a tech start-up on Old Street.

07:26.293 --> 07:28.795
Police. I'm DI Clayton.

07:29.326 --> 07:31.100
I'm looking for Rachel Spikes.

07:31.159 --> 07:32.912
That's me.

07:32.970 --> 07:34.187
And you are?

07:34.245 --> 07:36.465
- Woody Gilbert.
- He works for me.

07:36.523 --> 07:39.964
- You're in charge? Jeez, I feel old.
- You are old.

07:41.565 --> 07:44.926
Demon Slayer? So this
is what you call work?

07:45.033 --> 07:46.635
No, it's just for fun.

07:46.705 --> 07:48.760
Is this about the crash?

07:48.851 --> 07:52.121
Yes. When did you last see Davey Wells?

07:52.156 --> 07:54.607
- Last week.
- You weren't at the launch?

07:54.642 --> 07:57.862
Davey never has the techies
around when the press are involved.

07:58.499 --> 08:02.763
- What went wrong?
- Someone died, that's what went wrong.

08:02.798 --> 08:04.778
Did you know Mary Wells?

08:04.860 --> 08:05.891
No.

08:06.952 --> 08:08.796
We knew who she was, of course.

08:09.595 --> 08:12.230
Could there have been an error
with the programming somewhere?

08:12.300 --> 08:13.160
No way.

08:13.216 --> 08:17.128
We spent months testing
and retesting everything.

08:17.170 --> 08:19.666
We're going over it all again now.

08:19.722 --> 08:22.257
The car system was working perfectly.

08:22.319 --> 08:24.949
Look, we're gutted about Mary,

08:25.012 --> 08:29.050
but you need to understand that
our careers are stuffed now, too.

08:29.121 --> 08:31.311
Could someone have hacked
the operating system,

08:31.374 --> 08:32.676
caused a malfunction?

08:32.749 --> 08:34.495
- Unlikely.
- What are the odds?

08:34.568 --> 08:37.539
About 75,000 to one.

08:37.601 --> 08:39.292
That's a very precise answer.

08:39.370 --> 08:41.984
I'm interested in the
science of probability.

08:42.070 --> 08:45.137
So, what are the odds you could
have made a mistake with the coding?

08:45.172 --> 08:47.417
- Pretty much zero.
- Pretty much?

08:47.480 --> 08:51.417
Well, obviously zero probability
is statistically impossible.

08:56.115 --> 09:00.608
This has just been downloaded from
the car's black box data recorder.

09:01.180 --> 09:03.000
<i>Just keep waving and smiling.</i>

09:03.076 --> 09:06.590
<i>I am smiling, Davey,
but if you keep ordering me about,</i>

09:06.664 --> 09:08.224
<i>I'll shove your mobile
down your throat.</i>

09:08.269 --> 09:11.059
<i>For God's sake, not today,
the investors are watching.</i>

09:11.124 --> 09:14.233
<i>Yeah, yeah, it's always
about the bloody investors.</i>

09:15.084 --> 09:17.524
- Trouble in paradise.
- It could just be a row.

09:17.598 --> 09:18.881
Yeah, but why won't he speak to us?

09:18.905 --> 09:21.649
Then there's the issue of the call
he received just before the crash.

09:21.703 --> 09:25.595
Digital Forensics say it came from an
unregistered number, a computer network.

09:25.689 --> 09:27.202
It lasted less than a second,

09:27.237 --> 09:29.330
so that could have been
the trigger for a hack

09:29.402 --> 09:31.579
into the car's operating system.

09:31.688 --> 09:34.687
Someone wants Mary Wells
dead and they're at the scene

09:34.769 --> 09:37.112
so that they can see when
she's in the car alone.

09:37.175 --> 09:38.429
The timing is critical.

09:38.464 --> 09:40.362
We need to search Wells' personal computer.

09:40.397 --> 09:41.951
We'll need a warrant for that,

09:42.018 --> 09:44.387
and I'm not sure we have
enough to justify it.

09:44.426 --> 09:45.946
We've got nothing until we talk to Wells.

09:45.970 --> 09:48.647
If he doesn't volunteer himself tomorrow,

09:48.726 --> 09:50.296
then we'll look at a warrant.

09:50.358 --> 09:52.204
- Tomorrow!
- We tread carefully.

09:52.255 --> 09:53.815
Look into his business dealings.

09:53.905 --> 09:57.605
Let's have some hard evidence to
put in front of him when he comes in.

09:57.674 --> 09:58.834
OK.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.189
No, come on, I'm leaving.

10:02.224 --> 10:05.880
Documents relating to Davey
Wells' business interests.

10:05.965 --> 10:08.525
- I'm not working that case.
- You are now.

10:09.790 --> 10:12.625
- What, just me? Where are you going?
- Out.

10:24.237 --> 10:25.519
You look amazing.

10:26.794 --> 10:28.590
I wake up like this.

10:30.145 --> 10:31.452
What are we doing?

10:32.444 --> 10:34.663
Something to take my mind off work.

10:35.895 --> 10:37.694
It's been a frustrating day.

10:41.831 --> 10:43.631
I like this new Harry.

10:45.679 --> 10:47.064
So does Harry.

10:48.782 --> 10:51.362
You shouldn't let people
give you the run-around.

10:52.121 --> 10:54.639
Make them do what you want.

10:54.725 --> 10:56.341
It's not how we do it in the force.

10:56.376 --> 10:59.409
<i>No, it's not how they do it.</i>

11:00.500 --> 11:01.780
Come on.

11:13.045 --> 11:15.502
- Yeah, sorry we couldn't help you.
- Thanks.

11:20.347 --> 11:23.987
So, the security man says he's not at home.

11:24.960 --> 11:26.752
Pop in and find out.

11:26.815 --> 11:28.723
I don't have a warrant.

11:28.839 --> 11:30.401
You have the bracelet.

11:30.436 --> 11:31.946
Don't be coy.

11:32.296 --> 11:33.950
I'll show you coy.

11:38.818 --> 11:40.898
Oi! Oi! What are you doing?

11:44.989 --> 11:46.349
Come back!

11:50.405 --> 11:51.707
Argh!

11:51.934 --> 11:54.659
Are you all right there?

11:54.803 --> 11:56.663
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

12:32.256 --> 12:34.896
- Who the hell are you?
- DI Clayton.

12:36.501 --> 12:37.620
You're right, Miss Perera,

12:37.693 --> 12:39.373
he isn't in a fit state to be interviewed.

12:39.424 --> 12:41.304
You can't just go breaking
into people's homes.

12:41.339 --> 12:44.378
- Actually, the door was open.
- Where's your warrant, DI Clayton?

12:44.413 --> 12:47.134
Why don't we have that
discussion when you're dressed?

12:50.991 --> 12:52.884
Sort of a cliche, isn't it?

12:53.484 --> 12:55.829
Cheating on your wife with
some woman from the office.

12:55.864 --> 12:59.057
- Nice place.
- Look, I was going to call you tomorrow.

12:59.092 --> 13:00.925
I've been under pressure.

13:03.321 --> 13:05.718
So you're a hypocrite and a liar?

13:05.789 --> 13:08.607
- Excuse me?
- You wanted Mary dead, didn't you?

13:08.712 --> 13:10.492
You callous bastard.

13:11.364 --> 13:14.778
- Get out of my flat!
- Were you laughing as she drowned?

13:17.278 --> 13:18.705
Why did you go and do that for?

13:18.793 --> 13:22.465
Now I'm going to have to arrest
you for assaulting a police officer.

13:22.543 --> 13:24.023
Get dressed.

13:31.493 --> 13:34.119
Right, I'm off to interview Wells.

13:34.174 --> 13:35.656
What you got for me?

13:36.510 --> 13:40.790
I've been through all of Mary's
personal finances and legal files.

13:40.965 --> 13:43.633
- She was about to divorce him.
- Adultery?

13:43.719 --> 13:46.599
And she was threatening to pull her
investment out of Wells' business.

13:46.680 --> 13:47.834
It would have sunk him.

13:47.883 --> 13:49.948
- I thought he was loaded.
- No, that's all a front.

13:50.010 --> 13:52.027
The wife and the family
are propping him up.

13:52.083 --> 13:55.225
They put up the capital. It's all in here.

13:55.260 --> 13:58.981
All right, so she dies, his
investments remain in place.

14:00.828 --> 14:03.028
- Anything else?
- Yeah, can I have a coffee?

14:04.914 --> 14:08.170
- Cheers.
- So, why were you at Wells' place?

14:09.211 --> 14:13.203
Just went round to have a word
with him and he assaulted me.

14:13.238 --> 14:14.284
Anyway, it's all good because now we've got

14:14.308 --> 14:16.496
- something interesting on our hands.
- What?

14:16.580 --> 14:19.780
You wanted Wells' laptop,
you've got Wells' laptop.

14:21.948 --> 14:23.837
Shouldn't this be at Digital Forensics?

14:23.887 --> 14:25.456
No, they're up to their oxters.

14:25.491 --> 14:26.876
- Their what?
- Their oxters.

14:26.964 --> 14:29.108
Northern Irish for armpits.

14:29.194 --> 14:31.463
I'll have a look at it while
you're interviewing him if you like.

14:31.487 --> 14:32.738
That'd be great.

14:33.502 --> 14:35.422
This is all above board, yeah?

14:35.535 --> 14:38.052
Come talk to me first
if you find anything.

14:38.118 --> 14:39.398
Why?

14:39.620 --> 14:40.820
Harry!

14:45.399 --> 14:47.779
Shit, sorry, I should
have got you a hipster coffee.

14:47.861 --> 14:48.496
Piss off.

14:48.531 --> 14:50.411
I don't think we've got
that one in the machine.

14:50.501 --> 14:52.827
I should have hit your smug
face when I had the chance.

14:52.884 --> 14:55.136
Bit of a temper on you.
Is that why you killed her?

14:55.191 --> 14:56.711
Morning, Harry.

14:56.924 --> 14:59.244
I hope you're not questioning
a suspect in the corridor.

14:59.312 --> 15:02.114
Mr. Wells, Jonny Hawthorne, your brief.

15:02.149 --> 15:04.586
Please don't say another word.
You're being released immediately.

15:04.610 --> 15:06.931
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
we haven't even started yet.

15:06.979 --> 15:09.429
You entered my client's
property without a warrant.

15:09.553 --> 15:11.853
- He assaulted me.
- It was self-defence.

15:11.950 --> 15:13.590
He believed you to be an intruder

15:13.671 --> 15:16.672
- and there's also the issue of his laptop.
- What laptop?

15:16.751 --> 15:19.032
Miss Perera, who I believe
was with Mr. Wells at the time,

15:19.074 --> 15:21.145
has reported it missing.

15:21.285 --> 15:23.807
It's nothing personal,
Harry, just doing my job.

15:28.376 --> 15:29.588
Thanks, Jonny.

15:32.314 --> 15:33.954
He assaulted me.

15:34.028 --> 15:37.278
He did! And even if he hadn't,
we have a murder case here

15:37.339 --> 15:40.059
and he was hiding from us. He
wasn't sick so why is he lying?

15:40.117 --> 15:42.903
Right. And what's
all this about his laptop?

15:42.938 --> 15:43.569
Search me.

15:43.605 --> 15:45.835
I will, if it doesn't
find its way back to him.

15:49.069 --> 15:50.475
Well?

15:50.588 --> 15:53.052
- I didn't lie to you.
- No, you just didn't tell me the truth.

15:53.076 --> 15:54.130
What if Winter had seen me?

15:54.154 --> 15:56.719
I'd have taken full
responsibility, you know that.

15:56.781 --> 15:58.958
- Did you find anything?
- No, I can't break the encryption.

15:58.982 --> 16:00.893
It's way too sophisticated.

16:03.600 --> 16:05.427
Where are you going now?

16:05.530 --> 16:07.441
To see a girl about a dog.

16:12.204 --> 16:15.324
<i>There is a
good service on all lines.</i>

16:17.912 --> 16:19.712
Don't do it, man.

16:19.878 --> 16:21.770
Life's not so bad.

16:21.909 --> 16:23.389
Thanks for the reminder.

16:40.748 --> 16:41.923
Why me?

16:42.775 --> 16:45.114
Because you've got a double first
in maths and computer science,

16:45.138 --> 16:47.792
you won a European programming
competition at the age of 18.

16:47.832 --> 16:50.516
Wow, Grandad can google.

16:50.551 --> 16:52.307
Busy saving lives, kid.

16:53.061 --> 16:54.913
And I'm trying to change the world.

16:54.948 --> 16:56.668
With driverless cars?

16:56.803 --> 16:58.203
No.

16:58.404 --> 16:59.735
Code.

16:59.910 --> 17:01.590
Pure code. It...

17:01.827 --> 17:03.420
It's like poetry.

17:04.630 --> 17:06.703
I've been developing
something called Leveller

17:06.769 --> 17:12.785
since I was at school cos I want
life to be fairer for everyone.

17:14.027 --> 17:16.396
- What is it?
- An app.

17:17.074 --> 17:19.789
It utilises a new AI compute engine.

17:20.970 --> 17:25.077
It runs millions of personal
algorithms simultaneously.

17:25.140 --> 17:26.849
Stop the tube, I want to get off.

17:26.962 --> 17:28.602
It's like...

17:28.722 --> 17:33.066
having a lawyer, a doctor, a
life coach, or a personal trainer

17:33.101 --> 17:36.506
in your pocket and available 24/7, yeah?

17:37.585 --> 17:39.539
So you eliminate risk.

17:39.867 --> 17:42.742
You can't ever eliminate risk.

17:42.849 --> 17:44.889
That goes against all
the laws of probability,

17:44.970 --> 17:46.736
but you can even things out.

17:47.653 --> 17:49.451
Right, so...

17:49.650 --> 17:52.564
I could have used it to weigh up
the risk of giving you Wells' laptop,

17:52.630 --> 17:54.459
- for example?
- Exactly.

17:54.591 --> 17:56.450
And what would it have advised me?

17:57.270 --> 18:02.312
It would have said if anyone can
break the encryption, Spikesy can.

18:08.180 --> 18:11.253
I need it back within an hour so
they don't miss it. Can you do that?

18:11.910 --> 18:13.160
Probably.

18:15.800 --> 18:17.762
<i>This station is Moorgate.</i>

18:20.918 --> 18:23.355
Harry, you need to hear me out.

18:23.444 --> 18:24.685
Please listen.

18:25.595 --> 18:27.075
Please!

18:27.297 --> 18:28.830
I've nothing to say to you.

18:29.617 --> 18:31.057
I realise you deserve to know,

18:31.131 --> 18:35.055
but let me explain why I didn't
tell you I'm Isabella's torch.

18:38.290 --> 18:40.010
She's my best friend.

18:40.170 --> 18:43.991
I thought if I gave her the bracelet,
it would make her life perfect.

18:44.077 --> 18:48.490
But she wouldn't stop... the
holidays, the perfect man,

18:48.696 --> 18:55.308
these lottery wins and these
two beautiful little girls.

18:57.649 --> 19:01.328
I was standing by the side of
a road and the car exploded.

19:01.413 --> 19:03.505
It's just all that luck,

19:03.588 --> 19:06.267
win after win, there had to be a payback.

19:07.334 --> 19:09.299
She blames me, of course.

19:10.949 --> 19:13.290
- She's right.
- Did you warn her?

19:13.340 --> 19:15.927
Yes, of course I did.

19:20.531 --> 19:22.918
- I'm sorry.
- Why are you telling me this?

19:22.976 --> 19:26.756
- Why?
- I am so sorry for what I've done.

19:26.825 --> 19:28.211
You can use it for good things.

19:28.283 --> 19:31.590
You have a chance, as long as
you stay away from Isabella.

19:31.660 --> 19:34.879
- You said this was a gift, not a curse.
- She has a black heart.

19:34.914 --> 19:38.274
She will suck you down with
her. She's... Believe me, she...

19:38.741 --> 19:40.295
She's a monster.

19:43.633 --> 19:45.135
She's the monster?

19:49.868 --> 19:54.410
Why do you think nothing bad has
happened to you ever since you met her?

19:54.445 --> 19:57.246
Like... All this luck and, and...

19:57.814 --> 20:00.158
Daisy and Anna are totally fine,

20:00.193 --> 20:05.121
it's because she is the worst
luck that could ever happen to you.

20:08.992 --> 20:10.666
I promise you, Harry.

20:11.742 --> 20:13.262
I promise.

20:15.373 --> 20:16.373
Rachel.

20:18.769 --> 20:19.809
So?

20:20.705 --> 20:24.429
The car systems were hacked by
uploading a Trojan into its ECU.

20:24.490 --> 20:27.147
- A what into a what?
- A type of virus into the main computer

20:27.182 --> 20:28.653
inside the vehicle.

20:28.731 --> 20:30.813
- How?
- Bluetooth.

20:30.907 --> 20:33.347
The call to Davey's mobile
must have triggered the upload.

20:33.410 --> 20:35.930
And that could only have been
done by somebody at the event?

20:36.004 --> 20:37.924
The call could have been
triggered from anywhere,

20:37.973 --> 20:39.691
but someone must have had eyes on the event

20:39.715 --> 20:41.484
in order to know when to pull that trigger.

20:41.570 --> 20:42.448
Thanks, I appreciate it.

20:42.509 --> 20:44.957
Listen, I need you to send me
the relevant files anonymously.

20:45.012 --> 20:47.365
Make the e-mail look like
a tip-off from a hacker.

20:47.436 --> 20:48.436
OK.

20:50.323 --> 20:51.566
We have motive.

20:51.612 --> 20:53.701
His company was in trouble, his
wife was about to pull the plug

20:53.725 --> 20:55.481
and now we have firm evidence
that he hacked the car.

20:55.505 --> 20:57.100
Where's the evidence from?

20:57.135 --> 20:58.694
- A tip-off.
- The source?

20:58.766 --> 21:00.906
- Anonymous.
- Anonymous?

21:01.664 --> 21:04.610
And we still have a missing
laptop. Is that a coincidence?

21:05.724 --> 21:07.305
It'd be a hell of a gamble, wouldn't it,

21:07.306 --> 21:09.895
if an officer relied on
information from a stolen computer?

21:09.985 --> 21:13.411
Risk destroying the case
completely, wouldn't it?

21:14.655 --> 21:15.932
I would like to re-arrest Davey Wells.

21:15.956 --> 21:17.499
- May I?
- No, Harry.

21:17.571 --> 21:19.771
I want the information
in this anonymous tip-off

21:19.806 --> 21:21.919
run by Digital Forensics.

21:22.007 --> 21:24.047
We're going to do this right this time.

21:25.771 --> 21:28.655
So, when Forensics check the
tip-off, what do they find?

21:28.731 --> 21:30.204
The source is sound, Suri.

21:30.293 --> 21:32.133
How can you be sure if it's anonymous?

21:32.218 --> 21:33.244
Because it's Rachel Spikes.

21:33.268 --> 21:34.716
- The girls' a bloody genius.
- Rachel?

21:34.740 --> 21:36.051
How do you know you can trust her?

21:36.075 --> 21:38.548
Because she's got as much to
lose from the car crash as anyone.

21:38.572 --> 21:41.431
- How can you be sure?
- I trust the odds.

22:28.175 --> 22:29.455
- All right?
- Yep.

22:30.836 --> 22:32.264
- What's up?
- Nothing.

22:35.027 --> 22:37.004
- Goodnight there.
- Goodnight.

22:42.967 --> 22:44.616
So, this is very nice.

22:45.310 --> 22:46.693
A bit unusual.

22:47.525 --> 22:48.775
Well...

22:48.907 --> 22:51.004
I had the chance to go home and proof-read

22:51.073 --> 22:53.745
a community crime review paper

22:53.850 --> 22:55.815
or find out the truth about you.

22:56.731 --> 22:59.203
- How do you mean?
- Are you gambling again?

23:00.023 --> 23:01.359
No, I haven't been near a casino in months.

23:01.383 --> 23:02.527
The racetrack, then.

23:02.562 --> 23:03.642
I swear.

23:05.197 --> 23:08.721
You're on something and I'm
not the only one to notice.

23:09.926 --> 23:12.577
- I'm worried about you.
- Well, there's no need.

23:12.655 --> 23:15.716
Life is good. I met someone.

23:15.802 --> 23:17.637
- Really?
- Do you want details?

23:17.707 --> 23:18.943
Absolutely not.

23:20.047 --> 23:22.570
What about you? You seeing anyone?

23:22.656 --> 23:26.078
No, I didn't get back into
the whole dating thing.

23:26.113 --> 23:27.672
You want to get yourself
back onto the market, mate.

23:27.696 --> 23:31.016
You want to get yourself back
on a 12-step programme, Harry.

23:31.690 --> 23:35.500
Now, I can ask you as a friend
or I'll order you as your boss.

23:35.535 --> 23:38.095
- I'll threaten you if you like.
- No!

23:38.301 --> 23:39.501
I'm just...

23:41.643 --> 23:43.895
OK, thanks.

23:46.876 --> 23:49.516
- Erm, I should respond to that.
- Sure.

23:58.599 --> 23:59.828
I need Leveller!

23:59.890 --> 24:02.076
- We've got to launch now.
- It's not ready.

24:02.190 --> 24:04.368
It doesn't matter. We've got to
launch now to stay in the game.

24:04.392 --> 24:08.015
- It's not a game to me. You can't have it.
- It is mine!

24:08.194 --> 24:09.931
This office belongs to me!

24:09.966 --> 24:12.953
Leveller belongs to me! I own you!

24:12.999 --> 24:14.688
- Dig in there.
- Thanks.

24:22.460 --> 24:24.098
It's not a commodity.

24:24.153 --> 24:25.269
It's a work of art!

24:25.304 --> 24:26.642
Don't you give me that
pretentious bollocks!

24:26.666 --> 24:28.013
I'm about to go bankrupt.

24:28.048 --> 24:30.069
- Leave her alone!
- It's all right, Woody.

24:30.117 --> 24:33.306
- No, it's not all right.
- Leave her alone.

24:33.364 --> 24:35.695
- Get out.
- Woody, I can handle this.

24:35.730 --> 24:37.384
Get out now, you're fired!

24:42.225 --> 24:43.421
Woody!

24:44.610 --> 24:45.770
What was all that about?

24:45.852 --> 24:48.240
- I was trying to protect you.
- Well, don't.

24:48.275 --> 24:49.756
What?

24:49.816 --> 24:52.669
You may be scared of
him, Rachel, but I'm not.

24:54.015 --> 24:56.095
- Wells! Wells!
- Woody, no!

24:56.169 --> 24:58.998
Do you think I was joking? Get out!

24:59.885 --> 25:01.469
Aaargh!

25:01.559 --> 25:03.639
Woody! Woody!

25:08.137 --> 25:09.549
I...

25:28.142 --> 25:30.959
- I told you, he just ran.
- Great, thanks.

25:31.498 --> 25:32.572
That was Orwell.

25:32.646 --> 25:34.320
No sign of Woody at his address.

25:34.380 --> 25:36.615
Is this room covered by CCTV?

25:36.815 --> 25:39.602
- No.
- Jeez, high-tech.

25:39.691 --> 25:43.011
Why would Woody throw
Davey Wells out of a window?

25:44.153 --> 25:46.174
What was your relationship with him?

25:47.056 --> 25:50.028
- Me and Woody? Are you serious?
- Be honest.

25:51.424 --> 25:55.024
We had a one-night stand about a
year ago after a night on the lash.

25:55.059 --> 25:57.979
- It meant nothing.
- I think it meant something to him.

26:00.335 --> 26:01.720
What's Leveller?

26:02.176 --> 26:03.673
Something Rachel's developing.

26:03.741 --> 26:06.115
- And you didn't tell me?
- It was just chat.

26:06.172 --> 26:09.252
- Why, are you jealous?
- Ha, yeah, jealous, that's what I am.

26:10.610 --> 26:13.016
Woody Gilbert's been
circulated and flagged.

26:13.096 --> 26:15.199
We're looking into all
previous known addresses.

26:15.255 --> 26:17.410
- Great.
- Have you spoken to his family?

26:17.476 --> 26:20.894
Er, mother hasn't seen
him in months, no siblings.

26:20.929 --> 26:21.562
Friends?

26:21.624 --> 26:24.050
As far as we can establish,
he doesn't have any.

26:24.170 --> 26:25.170
Suri...

26:28.304 --> 26:30.367
As if anyone tells me anything.

26:31.056 --> 26:33.675
So, how's Woody feeling right now?

26:36.688 --> 26:38.354
Well, distressed.

26:39.890 --> 26:42.210
Hurting. Alone.

26:42.361 --> 26:44.441
He'll be trying to block it all out,

26:44.604 --> 26:46.053
but he's an obsessive.

26:46.124 --> 26:47.905
OK, so what's his addiction?

26:47.975 --> 26:50.050
Drink? Drugs? Porn?

26:50.138 --> 26:51.538
Gaming.

26:51.752 --> 26:56.410
Yeah. He'll be locked in some
virtual reality fantasy world,

26:56.460 --> 26:58.220
fighting off armoured goblins.

26:59.806 --> 27:02.350
If we had an online ID, we could trace it.

27:02.539 --> 27:04.011
Really?

27:04.807 --> 27:06.546
Try Demon Slayer.

27:14.367 --> 27:15.957
We've got a trace on Demon Slayer.

27:16.028 --> 27:18.326
City View Hotel, Bethnal Green Station.

27:18.404 --> 27:20.519
Great. Suri? Where's Suri?

27:21.850 --> 27:23.014
You'll have to do.

27:24.010 --> 27:26.187
Wow, thank you.

27:39.011 --> 27:41.348
All right, OK. Thanks.

27:41.507 --> 27:44.334
Manager says he's definitely in, room 119.

27:45.079 --> 27:46.456
Are you sure it's him?

27:46.530 --> 27:48.672
Apparently he checked
in under his own name.

27:49.167 --> 27:52.087
This is not a criminal
mastermind we're dealing with.

27:59.437 --> 28:01.646
Did your mummy not tell
you you'll go blind?

28:06.653 --> 28:07.653
Ha.

28:30.757 --> 28:33.322
<i>Hi, this is Harry Clayton.
Please leave a message.</i>

28:33.423 --> 28:36.047
Did you really think this
would win Rachel round?

28:36.138 --> 28:39.698
I love her. She doesn't
love me. I'm OK with that.

28:39.733 --> 28:41.321
You're a frustrated and angry young man.

28:41.345 --> 28:43.923
You sabotaged the vehicle
and murdered Mary Wells.

28:43.958 --> 28:45.265
I didn't do that.

28:45.300 --> 28:47.927
- Woody...
- Well, it was an accident, wasn't it?

28:48.026 --> 28:49.945
You wanted to kill Davey
Wells so you tried again.

28:49.969 --> 28:53.709
- You pushed him through the window.
- He fell! I was nowhere near him.

28:53.763 --> 28:56.200
Two murders. You must really love her.

28:56.235 --> 28:59.176
A word, both of you.

29:14.722 --> 29:15.923
You again.

29:18.039 --> 29:20.105
I've just got a few more questions.

29:20.655 --> 29:22.135
Fire away.

29:22.217 --> 29:26.677
I've seen Davey Wells' laptop,
the one you decrypted for Harry.

29:26.791 --> 29:28.517
I've no idea what you're on about.

29:28.552 --> 29:30.745
A virtual machine was running
another operating system

29:30.814 --> 29:33.854
and routing all traffic
through an anonymous VPN.

29:34.807 --> 29:35.855
So?

29:35.912 --> 29:37.894
Hackers do it all the time
to hide their identity.

29:37.929 --> 29:39.889
Wells wouldn't have had
the skills to do that.

29:41.592 --> 29:43.551
Yeah, but Woody did.

29:44.055 --> 29:46.771
He must have reverse-engineered the
whole thing to make it look like Wells.

29:46.795 --> 29:50.699
The syslog was reprogrammed
the day after the car crashed.

29:50.878 --> 29:54.249
After Harry gave it to you to look at.

30:00.513 --> 30:04.245
We've just been e-mailed
CCTV footage of Wells' death.

30:06.481 --> 30:09.177
- I thought there wasn't a camera.
- It's from an adjacent office.

30:09.230 --> 30:10.929
It was knocked in the wrong direction.

30:10.965 --> 30:12.714
It was pointing through the window.

30:13.463 --> 30:15.114
It's quite a coincidence.

30:16.171 --> 30:19.776
- So, the light blows, he falls back.
- So, Woody was nowhere near him.

30:19.874 --> 30:21.503
It was just an accident.

30:21.614 --> 30:23.784
Just pure bad luck.

30:23.855 --> 30:25.530
What time was that recorded?

30:25.775 --> 30:28.415
He fell at exactly 9:31.

30:30.323 --> 30:32.563
Sorry.

30:35.542 --> 30:37.511
Can we see that again, please? Just in...

30:37.577 --> 30:39.689
<i>You have one new message.</i>

30:39.739 --> 30:42.463
<i>Harry, meet me at
Spikesy's as soon as you can.</i>

30:42.498 --> 30:44.935
<i>I may have evidence that
Rachel tampered with the data.</i>

30:45.048 --> 30:46.528
<i>I'm driving there now.</i>

30:49.945 --> 30:52.785
OK, Steve, we can
release Woody Gilbert now.

30:56.114 --> 30:57.140
Suri?

30:58.025 --> 31:00.520
- Hello?
- S... Suri!

31:00.859 --> 31:02.805
- Hello?
- Suri, you OK?

31:02.871 --> 31:04.711
- I'm fine.
- Hold up.

31:07.370 --> 31:09.335
- Has she gone?
- Who gone?

31:09.370 --> 31:12.200
It was her that planted
the evidence for the hack.

31:12.242 --> 31:15.762
- How do you know that?
- I copied the contents of Wells' computer.

31:15.797 --> 31:17.975
- The data was doctored.
- You did what?

31:18.010 --> 31:20.320
Well, you were so obsessed with
her, convinced she was in the clear,

31:20.344 --> 31:21.714
someone had to cover your arse.

31:21.749 --> 31:24.241
If Winter found out that
you had stolen evidence...

31:24.294 --> 31:26.118
You do it, stuff like that all the time.

31:26.153 --> 31:28.407
Yeah, but I do it so
you don't have to. God...

31:28.477 --> 31:30.973
- Y-You don't want to turn into me.
- Why not?

31:31.051 --> 31:32.726
That is a question you can only answer

31:32.761 --> 31:34.610
with a very big drink in your hand.

31:37.684 --> 31:40.097
- I'm sorry.
- Apology accepted.

31:40.480 --> 31:42.626
She's wiped every computer.

31:42.699 --> 31:46.070
Yeah, but I've still
got Davey Wells' laptop.

31:52.186 --> 31:54.348
Where are you, Rachel?

32:57.710 --> 32:59.872
Daisy?

32:59.975 --> 33:02.670
Dad, you're OK! You're walking.

33:02.751 --> 33:05.119
I know, I know, I know, I'm all right.

33:05.201 --> 33:08.404
- I was so worried about you.
- I'm sure you were. I'm fine.

33:09.497 --> 33:11.192
Here, do us a favour. Erm...

33:11.227 --> 33:12.168
There's a machine up there.

33:12.203 --> 33:16.863
Go and get me a black coffee,
please. We'll catch up, OK?

33:23.376 --> 33:25.032
You look a mess.

33:25.067 --> 33:28.107
- Did you tell Daisy what happened?
- Not all the details.

33:28.567 --> 33:30.215
Great, I'll tell her
Jonny tried to kill me.

33:30.239 --> 33:31.692
Don't you bloody dare!

33:34.969 --> 33:37.335
- Where are you going to live?
- I'll be fine.

33:38.061 --> 33:39.525
Listen, thanks for coming.

33:39.560 --> 33:42.090
I'm sorry, I've got to
dash. This case is...

33:43.511 --> 33:44.711
Yeah.

33:46.040 --> 33:47.360
- What?
- What?

33:48.786 --> 33:50.542
- You know something?
- No.

33:51.243 --> 33:52.563
Anna...

33:53.523 --> 33:55.935
I... I can't.

33:55.970 --> 33:58.841
Listen, someone just tried to kill
me and they're still out there.

34:04.779 --> 34:07.769
OK, I know Jonny's been
working with Lakshi Perera.

34:08.255 --> 34:10.255
Yeah, Wells' head of legal.

34:10.291 --> 34:14.621
So she said that Rachel Spikes
came to see her yesterday.

34:14.657 --> 34:16.378
Apparently, Rachel's
locked into this contract

34:16.402 --> 34:19.347
where Wells owned all her intellectual
property for the next 30 years.

34:19.409 --> 34:21.868
Yeah, I know, I know Wells
owned Spikesy Business.

34:21.918 --> 34:26.585
No, it's more than that. Basically,
he owned Rachel Spikes herself,

34:26.629 --> 34:29.882
including every brilliant
idea she might come up with.

34:30.713 --> 34:33.931
So why is she going to see Lakshi Perera?

34:34.054 --> 34:38.114
Apparently she thought his death
would get her out of the contract.

34:38.199 --> 34:39.455
And did it?

34:39.637 --> 34:40.956
No, of course not.

34:41.007 --> 34:44.023
The contract's with the
company, not with the individual.

34:44.143 --> 34:46.820
- She's trapped.
- Yeah.

34:46.956 --> 34:48.235
Come on, slowcoach.

34:49.503 --> 34:50.822
Thank you.

34:50.975 --> 34:52.415
You're welcome.

34:52.534 --> 34:54.014
Hi.

34:54.228 --> 34:57.168
- Harry!
- What? It's nothing.

34:57.207 --> 34:59.298
I'll rest when we catch
her. What have we got?

34:59.356 --> 35:01.039
She's vanished into thin air.

35:01.074 --> 35:02.881
Chances are she's trying
to flee the country.

35:02.957 --> 35:05.877
Two things... this just
came in from Lakshi Perera.

35:06.272 --> 35:08.765
It's the attendees and the
schedule from the car launch.

35:08.800 --> 35:09.880
Better late than never.

35:10.013 --> 35:13.575
And the council got back and
confirmed that the barrier was broken

35:13.640 --> 35:15.260
prior to the crash taking place.

35:15.346 --> 35:17.026
So it was just bad luck.

35:17.295 --> 35:19.175
Leveller is her only love.

35:19.349 --> 35:20.589
It's her baby.

35:20.695 --> 35:23.914
Now she knows that Davey
Wells' death makes no difference

35:23.949 --> 35:26.069
to her situation, she's going to want to...

35:26.495 --> 35:28.782
hide it away forever, destroy it.

35:29.598 --> 35:32.032
We find Leveller, we find her.

35:33.855 --> 35:35.015
Suri.

35:36.822 --> 35:39.218
- And how about me?
- We're good.

35:39.301 --> 35:41.687
Cos I can do more than
just trawl paperwork.

35:41.722 --> 35:43.479
- Course you can.
- We're good.

35:50.513 --> 35:52.513
I took the demotion, I took the stick,

35:52.548 --> 35:55.024
I kept my head down, did what I was asked.

35:55.655 --> 35:58.055
- You want to be transferred?
- I'm not trusted.

35:59.260 --> 36:02.428
I think a fresh start
would be best for everyone.

36:03.217 --> 36:04.763
She used you, Woody.

36:04.817 --> 36:06.500
She tried to blame you.

36:06.597 --> 36:08.919
She said you created this Trojan.

36:11.341 --> 36:12.975
Where's Leveller?

36:13.245 --> 36:14.705
On a hard drive,

36:15.054 --> 36:17.615
locked away somewhere so
Wells could never get it.

36:17.891 --> 36:19.284
Any idea where she hid?

36:19.360 --> 36:21.313
A deposit box somewhere.

36:21.575 --> 36:23.815
Is there anything else you want to tell us?

36:25.375 --> 36:27.161
The coding in this Trojan...

36:28.088 --> 36:30.177
parts of it are the same as Leveller.

36:30.935 --> 36:33.015
See, code is like handwriting,

36:33.135 --> 36:34.441
everyone has their own style.

36:34.504 --> 36:36.694
So, if we find Leveller,
we'll have the evidence

36:36.729 --> 36:38.297
to connect Rachel to the car hack?

36:38.348 --> 36:40.804
An expert could see the
same person created both.

36:40.874 --> 36:42.779
Did she say anything else
about the deposit box?

36:42.829 --> 36:43.829
Nothing.

36:43.973 --> 36:45.453
Leveller's her baby.

36:45.589 --> 36:47.420
She'd go and check on it from time to time,

36:47.498 --> 36:50.132
pop out at lunch just
to make sure it was safe.

36:50.980 --> 36:54.260
She's not going to share something
like that with me, is she?

36:57.315 --> 36:59.855
How many deposit boxes do
you think there are in London?

37:00.015 --> 37:02.252
Well, Woody said she'd check
on Leveller at lunch time

37:02.334 --> 37:04.324
so that's an hour... 30 minutes each way.

37:04.359 --> 37:07.504
Less than that. She'll have spent
ten minutes in there, minimum.

37:07.539 --> 37:11.644
Yeah, good. So, 25 minutes each
way, but by taxi or on foot?

37:11.711 --> 37:15.631
I bet she walked. Yeah, so google
the nearest one, see what comes up.

37:15.666 --> 37:17.840
Yeah, right. How lucky do you think we are?

37:19.575 --> 37:23.306
Right, the nearest vault
is at 140 Baker's Row.

37:26.787 --> 37:29.051
She's definitely in there.
Security have confirmed it.

37:29.125 --> 37:30.642
- I can't believe it.
- Check round the back,

37:30.666 --> 37:32.969
I don't want her to slip out
through any side entrance.

37:49.223 --> 37:50.663
Going somewhere?

37:55.223 --> 37:58.326
I weighed up the odds on how
best to do the right thing.

37:58.384 --> 37:59.918
I've seen the schedule.

38:00.173 --> 38:02.384
The event was running behind time.

38:02.677 --> 38:06.171
I think the car was supposed to be
empty when you triggered the hack.

38:06.698 --> 38:08.818
You didn't mean to kill anyone, did you?

38:10.053 --> 38:12.362
I just wanted to ruin his business.

38:12.924 --> 38:14.943
Because of Leveller?

38:15.323 --> 38:17.733
Wells was going to sell it to anyone.

38:18.533 --> 38:20.969
It was meant to change the world.

38:21.004 --> 38:22.037
I had to do something.

38:22.103 --> 38:24.639
- You understand that, don't you, Harry?
- I do.

38:28.923 --> 38:31.203
- Is it in there?
- Yeah.

38:33.301 --> 38:36.422
You know by now, outside
will be swarming with cops.

38:37.569 --> 38:40.180
I really have run out
of options, haven't I?

38:40.215 --> 38:41.215
Well...

38:52.664 --> 38:55.224
It's amazing what you
can buy on the dark web.

38:56.390 --> 38:59.937
You can get Semtex delivered
to your door within 24 hours.

39:01.615 --> 39:05.295
I'm blowing myself up and
I'm taking Leveller with me.

39:05.689 --> 39:07.209
I'm not leaving you.

39:08.621 --> 39:11.055
In this confined space,

39:11.090 --> 39:14.843
the charge from this explosive
will destroy everything in here.

39:16.500 --> 39:18.255
Show me Leveller.

39:18.593 --> 39:19.935
No.

39:20.315 --> 39:22.455
What if I told you I could open that safe?

39:22.732 --> 39:25.514
- You don't know the combination.
- I'll guess.

39:27.766 --> 39:29.846
This is a six-figure number.

39:31.135 --> 39:33.415
The odds on guessing it first time

39:33.604 --> 39:41.390
are 1,890,787,499 to one.

39:45.384 --> 39:47.033
If I get it right, you let me see it.

39:47.068 --> 39:48.788
If I don't, we'll die here together.

39:50.852 --> 39:52.855
- You're insane.
- No.

39:53.130 --> 39:54.198
I'm just a gambling addict

39:54.233 --> 39:56.753
who needs to get back
on the 12-step programme.

40:02.216 --> 40:03.336
Fine.

40:05.620 --> 40:07.020
One chance.

40:13.731 --> 40:15.251
One chance.

40:47.893 --> 40:50.106
That's completely impossible.

40:50.375 --> 40:51.723
How did you do that?

40:51.815 --> 40:58.812
Statistically, nothing is ever
completely impossible, remember?

41:03.114 --> 41:06.237
No! No, no! No! No!

41:06.318 --> 41:08.007
No! No!

41:08.455 --> 41:11.051
Go. Go over there. Go.

41:29.555 --> 41:34.467
Rachel Spikes, I'm arresting
you for the murder of Mary Wells.

41:36.589 --> 41:38.501
You don't have to say anything...

42:00.020 --> 42:01.815
What do you want?

42:02.028 --> 42:03.424
The flat burned down...

42:04.472 --> 42:06.415
and I'm going out tonight,

42:06.543 --> 42:10.192
I've no other clothes, and you're my size.

42:12.523 --> 42:13.963
Right.

42:21.455 --> 42:23.204
Don't touch my pants.

42:59.560 --> 43:01.145
You're so quiet.

43:02.190 --> 43:04.470
Don't you like jazz?

43:08.745 --> 43:12.170
- You know that guy whose house we went to?
- Who?

43:12.205 --> 43:14.909
Davey Wells, the one I told you about.

43:14.944 --> 43:18.431
Yes, the one that was messing you around.

43:18.486 --> 43:20.947
- He died in an accident.
- Did he?

43:21.003 --> 43:22.504
He fell out of a window.

43:22.647 --> 43:24.685
That's unfortunate.

43:26.896 --> 43:29.627
It happened about the same
time you sent me that text.

43:30.204 --> 43:31.616
Well, I send you lots of texts.

43:31.651 --> 43:35.836
No, the one where you asked me
if I wanted to be wicked with you.

43:37.951 --> 43:39.696
Yes.

43:40.476 --> 43:43.196
Your answer was rather boring, I recall.

43:44.997 --> 43:47.060
So, what did you get up to?

43:47.164 --> 43:48.769
Very wicked things.

43:50.530 --> 43:52.456
It turns out he was innocent.

43:52.554 --> 43:53.954
He didn't kill anyone.

43:56.032 --> 43:57.660
So, he's innocent.

43:57.960 --> 43:59.800
Purer than the driven snow.

44:00.859 --> 44:04.015
- Not quite.
- No.

44:04.166 --> 44:06.768
So, who cares?

44:31.022 --> 44:33.606
Classy, beautiful...

44:33.668 --> 44:35.381
what have you possibly
got to complain about?

44:35.405 --> 44:36.105
I'm not sure.

44:36.157 --> 44:38.332
- Do I kill people?
- Do you?

44:38.417 --> 44:40.344
Whoa, whoa, Steve!

44:42.143 --> 44:43.941
Is that a magic bracelet?

44:46.173 --> 44:47.700
I don't believe in addiction.

44:47.735 --> 44:48.895
It's a choice.

44:49.595 --> 44:52.795
We have no time so go, now.
