00:08.899 --> 00:11.667
A special thanks
to all those who volunteered

00:11.669 --> 00:13.802
at St. Anthony's bread line
during the week.

00:13.804 --> 00:16.338
A reminder that
the Ladies Auxiliary

00:16.340 --> 00:18.907
will be having
their bake sale this Sunday,

00:18.909 --> 00:20.876
and a special collection box
has been set up

00:20.878 --> 00:23.345
in the back of the church
to replace the money

00:23.347 --> 00:25.180
that was stolen from the rectory

00:25.182 --> 00:27.049
after last week's Mass.

00:27.051 --> 00:28.584
May almighty God bless you,

00:28.586 --> 00:30.252
in the name of the Father,

00:30.254 --> 00:32.354
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

00:32.356 --> 00:33.322
Amen.

00:33.324 --> 00:37.192
Mass has ended, go in peace.

00:38.262 --> 00:39.795
Did you know about that?

00:39.797 --> 00:41.430
No.

01:07.858 --> 01:09.258
There's no extra credit

01:09.260 --> 01:11.727
for staying
after Mass, you know.

01:12.763 --> 01:14.930
Why didn't you tell me
about the theft, Father?

01:14.932 --> 01:16.365
I didn't want to bother you.

01:16.367 --> 01:17.499
Since when?

01:17.501 --> 01:18.600
We'll recoup it.

01:18.602 --> 01:19.968
How much was taken?

01:19.970 --> 01:21.236
3,500.

01:21.238 --> 01:22.438
That's grand larceny.

01:22.440 --> 01:23.439
That's a felony.

01:23.441 --> 01:24.840
That's my business.

01:24.842 --> 01:26.008
That's what I do.

01:26.010 --> 01:28.110
I notified the local precinct.

01:28.112 --> 01:30.012
And where are they on it?

01:30.014 --> 01:31.480
I've not heard.

01:33.951 --> 01:35.984
Look, if you want to be useful,

01:35.986 --> 01:40.189
Francis, help me by putting
the hymnals back in the holders.

01:40.191 --> 01:43.058
Otherwise, Mass has ended.

01:43.060 --> 01:44.493
Go in peace.

02:04.548 --> 02:06.281
You the riding ADA on this?

02:06.283 --> 02:08.217
Lucky you.

02:08.219 --> 02:10.252
Yeah, lucky me. (whoops weakly)
What do we got here?

02:10.253 --> 02:12.087
Pablo Gonzalez,

02:12.089 --> 02:14.156
34 years old,
five entries, no exit.

02:14.158 --> 02:15.357
Literally.

02:15.359 --> 02:16.825
No exit, anywhere.

02:16.827 --> 02:18.260
We found some shell casings,

02:18.262 --> 02:19.595
but no murder weapon yet.

02:19.597 --> 02:21.430
What is this place?

02:21.432 --> 02:22.664
Neighbors say
cars pull up

02:22.666 --> 02:24.500
day and night,
dropping men off.

02:24.502 --> 02:26.235
A revolving door.

02:26.237 --> 02:27.736
It's a brothel?

02:27.738 --> 02:28.871
Patrol swept the place.

02:28.873 --> 02:31.373
They found four women
believed to be prostitutes.

02:31.375 --> 02:33.308
It looks like they sleep
down here, and <i>business</i>

02:33.310 --> 02:35.344
is conducted upstairs
in the four bedrooms.

02:35.346 --> 02:36.678
You question any of them yet?

02:36.680 --> 02:38.614
Not yet, we're gonna
do that right now.

02:38.616 --> 02:40.549
Let's make sure they
understand their rights.

02:40.551 --> 02:41.783
Of course we will.

02:41.785 --> 02:43.719
Right after we serve them
all tea and crumpets,

02:43.721 --> 02:45.621
and figure out
who killed this schlub.

02:45.623 --> 02:47.623
You, over here.

02:47.625 --> 02:49.258
Ma'am, can you
step to the side?

02:49.260 --> 02:50.626
Take a seat.

02:50.628 --> 02:52.227

03:19.123 --> 03:20.989

03:20.991 --> 03:22.724

It was me.

back the mules

06:17.975 --> 06:20.141

$30 for 15 minutes.

06:36.393 --> 06:39.594
...and if we asked to get paid,
he'd beat us up.

06:39.596 --> 06:41.329

07:03.420 --> 07:05.687

07:05.689 --> 07:07.589
I got three more
saying the same thing.

07:17.434 --> 07:18.800
Tell me you're not that Reagan?

07:18.802 --> 07:22.070
My grandfather's the PC,

07:22.072 --> 07:23.138

07:31.114 --> 07:34.015
GORMLEY: The barricaded
situation is over.

07:34.017 --> 07:35.850
The hostage was released
unharmed, and the perp,

07:35.852 --> 07:37.619
the perp gave himself up
without incident.

07:37.621 --> 07:41.389
Good, I want the duty captain's

07:41.391 --> 07:46.061
Sid, you come up with anything

07:46.063 --> 07:47.162

07:47.164 --> 07:50.131
dust the rectory
lock box for prints.

07:50.133 --> 07:51.866
Uh, they lifted some latents.

07:51.868 --> 07:53.101
When latent
ran the prints,

07:53.103 --> 07:55.704
they got a hit
on one Mason Reyes, 20,

07:55.706 --> 07:56.771
from Bay Ridge.

07:56.773 --> 07:58.039
Priors?

07:58.041 --> 08:00.408
He was arrested
for grand larceny two years ago,

08:00.410 --> 08:01.743
assault a year ago,

08:01.745 --> 08:03.478
and drug possession
eight months ago

08:03.480 --> 08:04.546
when he was 19.

08:04.548 --> 08:05.914
He was released on bail.

08:05.916 --> 08:08.216
You want to know who posted it?

08:08.218 --> 08:09.484
Who?

08:09.486 --> 08:11.019
Father Quinn.

08:14.057 --> 08:15.490
You want Reyes picked up?

08:15.492 --> 08:18.693
No, not yet.

08:21.665 --> 08:22.864
You're up late.

08:24.601 --> 08:27.001
Nicky's been arrested
for drug possession.

08:28.905 --> 08:30.638
Cocaine.

08:34.644 --> 08:35.977
Apparently, two grams

08:35.979 --> 08:37.812
were found in the car
she was driving.

08:37.813 --> 08:39.080
Plain sight.

08:39.082 --> 08:40.914
There were three other kids
in the car with her,

08:40.917 --> 08:42.784
including the kid
the car was registered to.

08:42.785 --> 08:44.251
Anyone claim ownership?

08:44.254 --> 08:45.353
No.

08:45.355 --> 08:47.422
She's being held
at the 5-1 in the Bronx.

08:47.424 --> 08:49.557
Those drugs are not hers.

08:49.559 --> 08:51.793
But your feud with the Bronx DA?

08:51.795 --> 08:52.994
For him,
Christmas just came early.

08:52.996 --> 08:55.497
Well, there's no way
that son of a bitch

08:55.499 --> 08:57.499
is gonna use my granddaughter
for headlines.

08:57.501 --> 08:59.067
That's gonna take
a team of wild horses...

08:59.069 --> 09:00.301
Then put one together.

09:00.303 --> 09:01.536
I'll see what I can do.

09:01.538 --> 09:02.570
GORMLEY:
I know Captain Bennett

09:02.572 --> 09:04.105
at the 5-1.
I'll give him a call.

09:04.107 --> 09:05.473
Thank you.

09:05.475 --> 09:07.275
You know you can't go up there.

09:08.879 --> 09:09.878
There's no detour,

09:09.880 --> 09:11.713
no excuse, no piece of business

09:11.715 --> 09:15.550
you can invent that has you
just dropping by the 5-1.

09:17.521 --> 09:19.654
I know that.

09:27.497 --> 09:28.496
Well, they all didn't kill him.

09:28.498 --> 09:29.464
Someone's lying.

09:29.466 --> 09:30.632
Let's just
arrest them all.

09:30.634 --> 09:32.000
Then we'll see
who can break first.

09:32.002 --> 09:33.034
You can't do that.

09:33.036 --> 09:34.803
It will weaken
my case down the line.

09:34.805 --> 09:36.671
A defense attorney
will use that to cast doubt,

09:36.673 --> 09:38.873
by saying even the police had
no idea who was responsible.

09:38.875 --> 09:41.543
Thing is, why the hell would
they all take credit for it?

09:41.545 --> 09:43.978
I mean, just to cover
for somebody else?

09:43.980 --> 09:45.480
It's pretty ingenious.

09:45.482 --> 09:47.549
I mean, if they all stick
to their claim of doing it,

09:47.551 --> 09:49.117
we can't try them
all for murder.

09:49.119 --> 09:50.351
BAEZ: So we thinking
they all got

09:50.353 --> 09:52.320
a tutorial in how to get
away with murder?

09:52.322 --> 09:55.023
Unless they're all playing
“I Am Spartacus.”

09:55.826 --> 09:57.125
What the hell are you
doing here?

09:57.127 --> 09:58.593
No one's hurt.

09:58.595 --> 10:00.528
Nicky's been arrested.

10:00.530 --> 10:01.596
What? Where?

10:01.598 --> 10:02.597
For what?

10:02.599 --> 10:04.165
In the Bronx, drug possession.

10:06.736 --> 10:08.002
I can drive you.

10:08.004 --> 10:09.904
Go.

10:09.906 --> 10:12.507
Go, you got to go.

10:12.509 --> 10:14.509
None of them would
cop to the drugs,

10:14.511 --> 10:15.810
so I had to arrest
all of them.

10:15.812 --> 10:16.978
Did you field test it?

10:16.980 --> 10:18.813
Yes, positive for cocaine.

10:18.815 --> 10:19.848
What's the weight?

10:19.850 --> 10:21.349
About two grams.

10:21.351 --> 10:22.750
Felony weight.

10:22.752 --> 10:24.486
Hopefully, whoever owns
it'll do the right thing,

10:24.488 --> 10:26.054
and your daughter can get
the charges dropped.

10:26.056 --> 10:27.322
She's inside.

10:30.994 --> 10:33.261
We couldn't very well
just stick her in a cell.

10:42.372 --> 10:43.972
Mom.

10:43.974 --> 10:45.373
Who owns the drugs?

10:46.209 --> 10:47.242
I don't know.

10:47.244 --> 10:48.943
Yeah, you do.

10:48.945 --> 10:50.912
Mom...
Do you know how serious this is?

10:50.914 --> 10:52.380
Yes.
It's felony weight.

10:52.382 --> 10:54.082
That means you'll have
a felony on your record,

10:54.084 --> 10:55.116
do you understand that?

10:55.118 --> 10:57.051
The drugs aren't mine.

10:58.788 --> 11:00.855
It doesn't matter
if they're yours or not, Nicky.

11:00.857 --> 11:01.956
The Penal Law
is clear on this.

11:01.958 --> 11:03.258
If someone
doesn't come forward

11:03.260 --> 11:04.759
and claim ownership
of the cocaine,

11:04.761 --> 11:06.861
you're all gonna be charged
on felony possession.

11:06.863 --> 11:08.496
ERIN:
It's a C felony.

11:08.498 --> 11:10.632
That means one to five years
if you're convicted.

11:10.634 --> 11:12.967
Stop.
No, I'm not gonna stop.

11:12.969 --> 11:14.869
Are you willing to do that?

11:14.871 --> 11:16.371
I told you,
the drugs aren't mine!

11:17.340 --> 11:21.676
Then, wise up and give up
whosever they are.

11:25.582 --> 11:27.382
I'm not sure.

11:31.888 --> 11:33.755
I'll see you in the morning,
in court.

11:33.757 --> 11:35.757
I have to stay here?

11:36.960 --> 11:39.827
Night court's closed.

11:39.829 --> 11:41.262
Reopens at 9:00 a.m.

11:44.568 --> 11:46.267
Where are the other kids
that were in the car with her?

11:46.269 --> 11:47.269
Holding.

11:48.071 --> 11:49.904
I want you to put
her in holding.

11:49.906 --> 11:51.039
Not with the other prisoners,

11:51.041 --> 11:53.408
but in squad holding cell,
on her own.

11:53.410 --> 11:54.242
You're sure about that?

11:54.244 --> 11:56.578
I'm sure.

11:57.681 --> 11:59.480
Erin...
What?

11:59.482 --> 12:01.015
You think she should have
special treatment?

12:01.017 --> 12:03.551
She's always been
smart and responsible.

12:03.553 --> 12:06.921
Right now she is not being
smart and responsible.

12:06.923 --> 12:08.189
Those are not her drugs,

12:08.191 --> 12:10.758
and she knows whose they are,
and she is not saying.

12:10.760 --> 12:12.727
I'll be damned
if I'm gonna let her sit

12:12.729 --> 12:14.228
in the captain's office
sipping hot cocoa,

12:14.230 --> 12:16.097
while she's being charged
with a felony

12:16.099 --> 12:18.366
for protecting her friends.

12:23.974 --> 12:25.506
BAILIFF:
<i>Docket number 3542776,</i>

12:25.508 --> 12:30.044
<i>The People versus</i>
<i>Nicole Reagan-Boyle.</i>

12:30.046 --> 12:32.413
Criminal Possession
of a Controlled Substance

12:32.415 --> 12:34.048
in the third degree.

12:34.050 --> 12:36.017
How do you plead?

12:36.019 --> 12:37.352
Robert Rattner,
from Rattner and Marx,

12:37.354 --> 12:38.386
not guilty, Your Honor.

12:38.388 --> 12:39.654
ADA:
Your Honor,

12:39.656 --> 12:41.556
we're not talking about
a bunch of college kids

12:41.558 --> 12:43.558
with a little marijuana
in the car.

12:43.560 --> 12:45.426
This is two grams of coke.

12:45.428 --> 12:46.461
That's felony weight.

12:46.463 --> 12:47.729
RATTNER:
The drugs in question

12:47.731 --> 12:49.931
have not undergone
a lab analysis, Your Honor.

12:49.933 --> 12:50.932
It was field tested.

12:50.934 --> 12:52.367
It is cocaine, Your Honor.

12:52.369 --> 12:54.102
And this is
a first offense.

12:54.104 --> 12:55.670
RATTNER:
My client's family has ties

12:55.672 --> 12:57.538
to the community,
in law enforcement

12:57.540 --> 12:59.874
as well as the
Manhattan DA's office.

12:59.876 --> 13:02.176
And that should not be
a get out of jail free card.

13:02.178 --> 13:03.444
RATTNER:
Her mother and her uncle

13:03.446 --> 13:04.445
are in attendance.

13:04.447 --> 13:05.813
We ask that she be released

13:05.815 --> 13:07.281
on her own recognizance.

13:08.852 --> 13:10.151
Granted.

13:13.623 --> 13:14.689
Mom.

13:14.691 --> 13:15.857
Not now.

13:27.572 --> 13:30.340
I got Pablo's autopsy report.

13:30.342 --> 13:31.574
They find out
that son of a bitch

13:31.576 --> 13:32.676
didn't have a heart?

13:32.678 --> 13:34.344
He died of multiple gunshots,

13:34.346 --> 13:36.012
five in all, two to the groin.

13:36.014 --> 13:37.714
(groans)

13:37.716 --> 13:39.883
According to ballistics,
all with the same gun.

13:39.885 --> 13:41.184
You run Pablo's address?

13:41.186 --> 13:42.185
I did.

13:42.187 --> 13:43.586
There was a police report

13:43.588 --> 13:45.121
and an arrest for assault

13:45.123 --> 13:46.856
at the address two months ago.

13:46.858 --> 13:48.792
A Javier Fernandez.

13:48.794 --> 13:49.959
Fernandez?

13:49.961 --> 13:52.195
You thinking there's
any relation to Martina?

13:52.197 --> 13:54.197
She's his sister.

13:54.199 --> 13:56.166
Huh.

13:56.168 --> 13:58.468
Uh, anything else
on the assault?

13:58.470 --> 14:00.336
Apparently,
he punched Pablo in the face,

14:00.338 --> 14:01.337
and threatened to kill him.

14:01.339 --> 14:03.039
Okay, where is he now?
He was issued

14:03.041 --> 14:04.240
a desk appearance ticket,

14:04.242 --> 14:05.542
but he never showed up to court,

14:05.544 --> 14:07.777
so now there's a bench warrant
out for his arrest.

14:07.779 --> 14:10.313
Well, it's a beautiful day
to execute a bench warrant.

14:10.315 --> 14:11.347
Let's grab them both.

14:11.349 --> 14:12.549
Divide and conquer?

14:12.551 --> 14:14.050
It worked for Julius Caesar.

14:19.725 --> 14:21.191
(sighs)

14:21.193 --> 14:22.258
Want something to eat?

14:22.260 --> 14:24.294
I'm not hungry.

14:27.165 --> 14:28.898
(sighs)

14:34.406 --> 14:36.906
Look, you don't have
to babysit me anymore.

14:36.908 --> 14:38.842
I'm fine.

14:38.844 --> 14:40.410
You know, your mom's just upset,

14:40.412 --> 14:42.412
because she's scared
about what's gonna happen.

14:42.414 --> 14:44.013
She's not the only one.

14:44.015 --> 14:47.383
She doesn't think
that you own the drugs, Nicky,

14:47.385 --> 14:50.019
but she thinks you know
which one of the kids does.

14:51.423 --> 14:53.356
Do you?

14:53.358 --> 14:55.191
(sighs)

14:55.193 --> 14:57.093
You need to think
about coming forward.

14:57.095 --> 14:58.261
And what?

14:58.263 --> 15:00.296
And snitch?
Is that what you'd do?

15:00.298 --> 15:02.632
They're not your friends
if they're jamming you up

15:02.634 --> 15:04.134
instead of taking
responsibility.

15:04.136 --> 15:07.403
I've been using the name Boyle
instead of Reagan at school

15:07.405 --> 15:09.839
because I didn't want
to always have to deal

15:09.841 --> 15:12.008
with being identified
with the NYPD.

15:13.512 --> 15:15.712
I don't want people to act
differently around me.

15:15.714 --> 15:17.046
Okay, but you're going
to have to find out

15:17.048 --> 15:19.182
how far you're willing
to go to fit in.

15:19.184 --> 15:20.183
The kids I was with...

15:20.185 --> 15:22.919
they're not bad kids,
Uncle Jamie.

15:24.289 --> 15:25.722
One of them kind of is.

15:25.724 --> 15:27.056
The one who's willing
to let three other people

15:27.058 --> 15:28.558
take the fall for his mistake.

15:28.560 --> 15:31.327
Uh, I need to talk to Grandpa.

15:31.329 --> 15:33.062
He's not gonna play a card here.

15:33.064 --> 15:35.532
I didn't say
I was gonna ask him to.

15:35.534 --> 15:37.767
He can't get involved.

15:37.769 --> 15:39.435
You can't have
this two ways here.

15:39.437 --> 15:42.305
I just need to talk to him.

15:44.743 --> 15:47.544
FATHER QUINN: I can tell
by the look on your face

15:47.546 --> 15:49.946
this is not
a social call, Francis.

15:49.948 --> 15:50.847
Good news.

15:50.849 --> 15:53.149
We found out
who stole the money.

15:53.151 --> 15:54.717
A Mason Reyes.

15:54.719 --> 15:57.487
Thank you.

15:57.489 --> 15:58.688
I believe you know him.

15:58.690 --> 16:00.623
And his family.

16:00.625 --> 16:04.093
Well, he's 20, so we can
charge him as an adult.

16:04.095 --> 16:07.831
The question is,
how do you know him?

16:07.833 --> 16:09.098
I don't, personally.

16:09.100 --> 16:10.967
Well, I do,

16:10.969 --> 16:13.403
and I will not
be pressing charges.

16:15.774 --> 16:17.640
Why wouldn't you
press charges, Father?

16:17.642 --> 16:19.409
He's a troubled kid.

16:19.411 --> 16:21.845
Well, clearly,
he stole money from our church.

16:21.847 --> 16:24.247
And I will find a way
to recoup it.

16:24.249 --> 16:26.149
That is not the point.

16:26.151 --> 16:27.784
Look, Frank.

16:27.786 --> 16:30.053
He's had a difficult life.

16:30.055 --> 16:32.589
Lots of people have
difficult lives, Father.

16:32.591 --> 16:35.458
That doesn't give them
the right to break the law,

16:35.460 --> 16:37.727
nor, frankly, you the right
to give him a free pass.

16:37.729 --> 16:39.629
Do not come in here and tell me

16:39.631 --> 16:42.298
who I can and cannot
show mercy to, Frank.

16:42.300 --> 16:44.701
Just who do you think
you're protecting here, Pete?

16:44.703 --> 16:45.835
Certainly not Reyes.

16:45.837 --> 16:47.270
He's just gonna do it again.

16:47.272 --> 16:49.539
I'm not a cop
for a million good reasons,

16:49.541 --> 16:52.208
and you are not a priest
for just as many.

16:52.210 --> 16:55.511
Last time he was arrested,
you posted his bail.

16:55.513 --> 16:56.913
That didn't do him any good.

16:56.915 --> 16:58.848
Neither will putting him
in prison.

17:01.486 --> 17:04.020
(sighs) So what's
your divine plan here, Pete?

17:04.021 --> 17:08.424
This parish is my precinct.

17:08.425 --> 17:10.827
The buck stops here with me,

17:10.829 --> 17:12.962
not you.

17:24.843 --> 17:26.709
Look, you don't have
to say anything, just don't.

17:26.711 --> 17:28.377
I've taken
two showers already,

17:28.380 --> 17:30.980
and I still feel disgusting.

17:30.982 --> 17:32.916
Well, the booking process
was not designed

17:32.918 --> 17:35.084
with comfort in mind.

17:35.086 --> 17:36.586
I made baked ziti.

17:36.588 --> 17:38.855
No, thank you.

17:41.693 --> 17:43.026
(sighs)

17:44.496 --> 17:48.965
Are you gonna give me
the cold shoulder all night?

17:48.967 --> 17:50.466
What do you
want me to say?

17:50.468 --> 17:51.868
They can't charge
all of us.

17:51.870 --> 17:53.536
They already have, Nicky.

17:53.538 --> 17:56.372
Exactly what I would have done
if I was the ADA on the case.

17:56.374 --> 17:59.709
You'd let innocent kids
get convicted of a felony?

17:59.711 --> 18:00.677
That's right.

18:00.679 --> 18:02.845
Come on, that's not true.

18:02.847 --> 18:04.747
I would have assumed
that not all of them

18:04.749 --> 18:06.416
would have been stupid enough
to take the blame

18:06.418 --> 18:07.850
for somebody else's mistake.

18:07.852 --> 18:10.320
So, what, you want me to rat
on one of my friends

18:10.322 --> 18:11.454
to save my own skin?

18:11.456 --> 18:13.623
Yes, that's exactly
what I want you to do.

18:13.625 --> 18:16.392
Well, that's not easy
to do, Mom.

18:16.394 --> 18:18.895
I didn't raise you
to take the easy way out.

18:18.897 --> 18:21.998
This is not about
being a rat or a snitch.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.066
A felony on your record

18:23.068 --> 18:24.867
means you can forget
about becoming a lawyer,

18:24.869 --> 18:26.970
or ever going
into law enforcement.

18:27.839 --> 18:30.006
(phone buzzing)

18:31.676 --> 18:33.810
We have an appointment with
the Bronx DA in the morning,

18:33.812 --> 18:35.712
unless you're okay
with throwing your future away,

18:35.714 --> 18:37.780
I suggest that you tell him
everything you know.

18:37.782 --> 18:39.248
Mom...
And if you don't,

18:39.250 --> 18:42.318
you can find a job
and a community college

18:42.320 --> 18:44.187
because you guys
are all suspended.

18:44.189 --> 18:47.090
What-what are you talking about?

18:47.092 --> 18:49.392
“Until such time
the police investigation

18:49.394 --> 18:51.661
reveals who the drugs
belong to.”

18:51.663 --> 18:53.896
Read the e-mail yourself.

18:55.333 --> 18:57.467
You think you can
just skate under the radar

18:57.469 --> 18:59.669
because you use
the last name Boyle?

18:59.671 --> 19:01.838
You think it's that easy?

19:01.840 --> 19:04.240
You think that Columbia
and the Bronx DA

19:04.242 --> 19:05.608
don't know exactly who you are?

19:05.610 --> 19:08.244
You think they're not gonna
make an example of you

19:08.246 --> 19:10.513
because of that?

19:11.883 --> 19:14.584
Mom, you're really scaring me.

19:15.420 --> 19:18.154
Welcome to reality.

19:24.129 --> 19:25.228
You threatened Pablo,

19:25.230 --> 19:27.263
and you said you
wanted to kill him.

19:27.265 --> 19:29.298
It's not a crime to threaten
to kill someone.

19:29.300 --> 19:32.168
Well, it is
when they end up dead.

19:32.170 --> 19:34.070
Do you have a sister?

19:34.072 --> 19:35.505
Why?

19:35.507 --> 19:38.141
If someone pretended
to be her boyfriend,

19:38.143 --> 19:40.376
then forced her
into prostitution,

19:40.378 --> 19:43.446
you think you would use
the words, “I'll kill you”

19:43.448 --> 19:44.547
when talking to him?

19:44.549 --> 19:45.615
I wouldn't talk to him.

19:45.617 --> 19:47.116
I'd just kill him.

19:48.353 --> 19:49.218
Isn't that what you did?

19:49.220 --> 19:50.486
No.

19:50.488 --> 19:52.655
So, you want me to believe
you went to his apartment

19:52.657 --> 19:53.790
to, what, threaten him?

19:53.792 --> 19:56.993
Actually, I went there
to kick his ass,

19:56.995 --> 19:58.461
and take my sister back home.

19:58.463 --> 20:00.997
Hmm... funny you didn't
do either one of them.

20:00.999 --> 20:01.964
Why not?

20:01.966 --> 20:03.666
Because the cops arrived, man.

20:03.668 --> 20:04.767
Right.

20:04.769 --> 20:06.069
Pablo told them
I hit him.

20:06.071 --> 20:08.137
Take one guess
who the cops believed?

20:08.139 --> 20:10.039
And Martina didn't
come to your defense?

20:10.041 --> 20:12.208
She was afraid to.

20:12.210 --> 20:15.578
I see you didn't make it
to your desk appearance ticket.

20:16.714 --> 20:19.348
I'm illegal, okay?

20:21.152 --> 20:23.953
I didn't want to get deported.

20:23.955 --> 20:25.254
I promised my mother

20:25.256 --> 20:27.623
that I wouldn't come back home
without Martina.

20:27.625 --> 20:29.692
Do you know
where Martina is now?

20:29.694 --> 20:31.394
No.

20:31.396 --> 20:32.995
Did she kill Pablo?

20:32.997 --> 20:34.397
No!

20:36.067 --> 20:39.735
Listen, growing up,

20:39.737 --> 20:41.871
if I did something wrong,

20:41.873 --> 20:44.874
I could always get her
to take the blame for me

20:44.876 --> 20:48.644
because she'd rather get in
trouble than see me in trouble.

20:48.646 --> 20:51.981
She taking the blame for you now
so you didn't get in trouble?

20:51.983 --> 20:53.082
No.

20:53.084 --> 20:55.651
She's the victim here,

20:55.653 --> 20:57.286
not Pablo.

20:58.356 --> 21:00.590
Could have fooled me.

21:03.561 --> 21:05.495
(sighs)
Any word on Martina yet?

21:05.497 --> 21:06.529
She's MIA.

21:06.531 --> 21:08.798
Great, we got four women
who say they did it.

21:08.800 --> 21:10.500
Martina's brother
says he wanted to do it,

21:10.502 --> 21:11.567
but he didn't do it.

21:11.569 --> 21:13.002
Great, let's just
add him to the list.

21:13.004 --> 21:14.370
All right.

21:14.372 --> 21:16.539
A part of me doesn't even
want to solve this thing.

21:16.541 --> 21:18.508
Well, Pablo is
the most unsympathetic Vic

21:18.510 --> 21:19.475
we've ever had.

21:19.477 --> 21:20.810
(sighing):
I don't know.

21:20.812 --> 21:22.612
Maybe we should just go
back to divide and conquer.

21:22.614 --> 21:23.779
You talk
to the women again.

21:23.781 --> 21:25.448
I'll check Javier's story.

21:45.470 --> 21:47.069
(phone rings)
Reagan.

21:47.071 --> 21:48.070
BAEZ: Danny.

21:48.072 --> 21:50.306
I found a suicide note
from Martina.

21:50.308 --> 21:52.542
Looks like she killed Pablo.

21:52.544 --> 21:54.377
I think I know
where she might be.

21:54.379 --> 21:56.412
I'm headed to Javier's.

21:58.416 --> 22:01.617
Mason Reyes lived with his dad
in Chatham, New Jersey,

22:01.619 --> 22:03.286
up until two years ago.

22:03.288 --> 22:04.353
The young kid's mother...

22:04.355 --> 22:05.922
He's not a kid-- he's 20.

22:05.924 --> 22:07.089
The young man's mother

22:07.091 --> 22:08.591
was murdered
in a home invasion.

22:11.362 --> 22:12.762
Did we get who killed her?

22:12.764 --> 22:14.997
Case is still open.

22:14.999 --> 22:16.032
But right after that,

22:16.034 --> 22:17.600
everything went south for Mason.

22:17.602 --> 22:20.069
He got arrested five times
in two years.

22:20.071 --> 22:21.437
Dad bailed him out every time.

22:21.439 --> 22:22.838
And now Father Quinn,

22:22.840 --> 22:26.242
which pretty much guarantees
that there will be a next time.

22:26.244 --> 22:27.977
Somebody's headed to the bottom,

22:27.979 --> 22:30.179
and they're gonna get there
regardless how many times

22:30.181 --> 22:31.380
you put out a net.

22:31.382 --> 22:33.015
You know, you're just
prolonging something...

22:33.017 --> 22:34.283
It's called enabling.

22:34.285 --> 22:36.085
Whatever you call it,
doesn't work.

22:36.087 --> 22:39.789
You do know that Father Quinn
is refusing to press charges.

22:39.791 --> 22:42.124
Oh, geez, a priest,
of all people...

22:42.126 --> 22:43.326
Exactly.

22:43.328 --> 22:44.794
You think he knows something
he ain't telling?

22:44.796 --> 22:46.896
Ah, he's a good priest
and a good man,

22:46.898 --> 22:50.132
but I'm not sure he has the pull
for divine intervention.

22:50.134 --> 22:52.168
You want to see if there's
a way around him?

22:52.170 --> 22:54.537
Find another way
to charge Mason?

22:54.539 --> 22:55.738
Yeah, it's not impossible.

22:55.740 --> 22:57.740
I don't know.

22:57.742 --> 22:59.575
Going around a Catholic priest?

22:59.577 --> 23:02.211
Yeah, no, mm, you're right.

23:03.581 --> 23:05.181
I got to find another way.

23:08.519 --> 23:11.954
Sid...

23:11.956 --> 23:14.290
any talk coming up
through the ranks

23:14.292 --> 23:16.659
about my granddaughter?

23:16.661 --> 23:17.727
Tell me the truth.

23:17.729 --> 23:19.629
Well... (chuckles)

23:19.631 --> 23:22.231
You know, they wouldn't say
anything in front of me, boss.

23:24.235 --> 23:25.434
Yeah.

23:28.239 --> 23:31.073
(sighs)

23:38.916 --> 23:40.783
(crying)

23:54.774 --> 23:56.673
(sobbing)

23:58.177 --> 23:59.777
Martina?

24:01.013 --> 24:02.679
Don't come near me.

24:02.681 --> 24:04.948
Don't worry about it.

24:04.950 --> 24:07.651
Taking a walk,
checking out the view.

24:10.089 --> 24:12.656
Just a little bit
afraid of heights.

24:14.293 --> 24:16.293
(crying)

24:19.465 --> 24:21.098
What're you doing?!

24:21.100 --> 24:23.033
Just sitting down,
like you, okay?

24:23.035 --> 24:25.102
I'm scared,
and you're scared,

24:25.104 --> 24:28.539
so I figure we could
both be scared together.

24:28.541 --> 24:30.274
DANNY:
So, what do you think?

24:30.276 --> 24:31.275
Seven stories,

24:31.277 --> 24:33.844
what is that,
about a hundred feet?

24:33.846 --> 24:34.978
It's pretty high.

24:34.980 --> 24:36.613
(crying)

24:36.615 --> 24:40.050
I had a, uh, case
about a year ago, a war vet.

24:40.052 --> 24:42.453
Found him on the roof,
just like you, wanted to jump...

24:42.455 --> 24:43.353
Would you just stop?!

24:43.355 --> 24:46.356
I'm just saying...

24:46.358 --> 24:48.559
I tried to talk him down.

24:48.561 --> 24:50.427
It didn't work.
He jumped anyway.

24:50.429 --> 24:53.497
But, I did see his face

24:53.499 --> 24:54.698
when he went over the edge.

24:54.700 --> 24:56.233
You know, his body turned
and I saw him,

24:56.235 --> 24:57.935
and I never forget
the look on his face.

24:57.937 --> 25:00.003
It was almost as if...

25:00.005 --> 25:01.705
he was changing his mind,
but it was too late.

25:01.707 --> 25:02.706
Then, boom.

25:02.708 --> 25:04.541
(crying)
Let me tell you something.

25:04.543 --> 25:06.210
Six stories made a boom,

25:06.212 --> 25:07.945
I can't imagine
what seven stories does.

25:07.947 --> 25:10.414
(crying):
Why are you doing this?

25:10.416 --> 25:12.449
I was gonna ask you
the same thing.

25:12.451 --> 25:13.684
Why are you doing this?

25:13.686 --> 25:15.819
Because I just want it
to be over!

25:15.821 --> 25:16.920
Hey! Hey!

25:16.922 --> 25:18.088
Look at me.

25:20.092 --> 25:21.925
Come on.
(crying): I can't do it.

25:21.927 --> 25:24.428
Listen, it is over.

25:24.430 --> 25:26.497
Okay? Pablo is dead.

25:26.499 --> 25:28.265
He can't hurt you anymore.

25:28.267 --> 25:29.867
I'm going to jail.

25:29.869 --> 25:33.737
Well, what if I...
what if I gave you my word

25:33.739 --> 25:35.272
that I would do
everything in my power

25:35.274 --> 25:37.107
to help you not go to jail?

25:38.577 --> 25:40.410
You can't promise that.

25:40.412 --> 25:41.578
I can't promise you
won't do any jail time,

25:41.580 --> 25:43.847
but I can promise you
that I will help you

25:43.849 --> 25:45.916
to do as little as possible,
if any at all.

25:45.918 --> 25:46.984
You're lying.

25:46.986 --> 25:50.220
Hey... a jury will
sympathize with you.

25:50.222 --> 25:52.055
With someone like me?
Yes.

25:52.057 --> 25:53.857
I do.

25:53.859 --> 25:55.726
You were young,
and naive,

25:55.728 --> 25:56.760
and he promised
you things,

25:56.762 --> 25:58.028
and he lied to you.

25:58.030 --> 25:59.963
Anybody would empathize
with that.

25:59.965 --> 26:02.733
He attacked me, you know.

26:02.735 --> 26:05.235
He found out I was hiding
money in my shoe.

26:05.237 --> 26:06.370
Okay.

26:06.372 --> 26:08.605
$40.

26:09.742 --> 26:12.376
He went crazy... for $40.

26:12.378 --> 26:14.511
Well, then it's self-defense,
isn't it?

26:14.513 --> 26:16.613
(crying):
I still killed him.

26:16.615 --> 26:17.948
And he deserved it.

26:17.950 --> 26:20.417
And you don't deserve this.

26:20.419 --> 26:21.952
Think about your family.

26:21.954 --> 26:22.920
Think about your brother.

26:22.922 --> 26:26.123
You think he wants you
to die this way?

26:26.125 --> 26:30.193
I don't want them to know what
happened to me since I got here.

26:31.864 --> 26:33.897
(crying):
I... how do I explain that?

26:33.899 --> 26:36.633
We will figure out
how to explain it together.

26:36.635 --> 26:38.769
But not here.

26:38.771 --> 26:40.270
Not like this.

26:40.272 --> 26:42.906
(sirens wailing)

26:45.110 --> 26:46.610
Hey.

26:46.612 --> 26:48.312
So, would you just trust me?

26:49.882 --> 26:51.748
Come on.

26:53.152 --> 26:54.518
Okay?

26:56.088 --> 26:57.688
(whispering):
Come on.

26:59.758 --> 27:01.658
That's it.

27:07.499 --> 27:09.499
(sobbing)
It's okay, I got you.

27:09.501 --> 27:11.835
(sobbing)

27:12.671 --> 27:14.504
I got you, girl.

27:18.310 --> 27:19.943
Why do you have
to go to confession

27:19.945 --> 27:21.311
in the middle of a tour?

27:21.313 --> 27:22.946
I just do.

27:22.948 --> 27:25.048
Did you do something
really bad?

27:25.050 --> 27:27.250
Not about that.

27:27.252 --> 27:28.585
Well, I'm not sure
what section

27:28.587 --> 27:30.454
this falls under
in the Patrol Guide.

27:30.456 --> 27:31.655
I've been cleared
from the top

27:31.657 --> 27:33.090
to take confession
with Father Quinn.

27:33.092 --> 27:35.125
Because?

27:35.127 --> 27:38.762
Because sometimes
in confession,

27:38.764 --> 27:42.165
both priest and sinner
can see some light.

27:45.137 --> 27:47.004
Can I ask you a question?

27:47.006 --> 27:49.106
This whole confession thing...

27:49.108 --> 27:53.410
say that you confess the same
thing over and over again,

27:53.412 --> 27:55.879
is there like a
three-strikes-you're-out clause?

27:55.881 --> 27:57.014
Far as I know,

27:57.016 --> 27:58.548
as long as you keep
asking for forgiveness,

27:58.550 --> 28:00.417
there's forgiveness to be had.

28:00.419 --> 28:02.085
Well, that's pretty great.

28:02.087 --> 28:04.087
12-David, be advised

28:04.089 --> 28:05.689
we have a 10-10,

28:05.691 --> 28:07.891
possible male with a gun
at Saint Angelus Church,

28:07.893 --> 28:09.493
700 Bay Ridge Avenue.

28:09.495 --> 28:11.995
But you do still have
to ask for forgiveness.

28:11.997 --> 28:13.363
12-David show us responding.

28:13.365 --> 28:15.932
(sirens wailing)

28:20.606 --> 28:22.439
Anything for me?

28:22.441 --> 28:24.007
You came all the way
up here to...

28:24.009 --> 28:25.742
Well, I was close by, so...

28:25.744 --> 28:27.644
The leverage
with Father Quinn

28:27.646 --> 28:29.046
that you're looking
for isn't there.

28:29.048 --> 28:31.248
No one in this office
will touch it.

28:31.250 --> 28:32.349
Even you?

28:32.351 --> 28:33.750
Especially me.

28:33.752 --> 28:35.018
Why not?

28:35.020 --> 28:36.019
It's difficult enough

28:36.021 --> 28:37.287
to try a case where the victim

28:37.289 --> 28:38.655
doesn't want to press charges.

28:38.657 --> 28:41.858
It's even more difficult
when that victim is a priest.

28:41.860 --> 28:44.861
Father Quinn is adamant,
he will not cooperate.

28:44.863 --> 28:48.532
But he will cooperate in letting
that kid become a chronic?

28:48.534 --> 28:52.035
There are all different kinds
of mercy, Dad.

28:52.037 --> 28:53.970
Including misguided mercy.

28:58.444 --> 29:00.811
What's your kind?

29:00.813 --> 29:02.145
On this?

29:02.981 --> 29:05.215
On Nicky.

29:07.653 --> 29:09.352
I'm handling it, Dad,

29:09.354 --> 29:11.822
and I know I don't need
to remind you to stay back

29:11.824 --> 29:13.290
a good 500 feet.

29:13.292 --> 29:15.726
You do not.

29:15.728 --> 29:18.795
I heard you had her put
in a holding cell overnight.

29:20.132 --> 29:21.865
You heard right.

29:21.867 --> 29:24.434
I'd like to think
I could do that.

29:24.436 --> 29:26.755
It's exactly
how you would have handled it.

29:26.756 --> 29:29.723
Oh, come on,
she's my granddaughter.

29:29.725 --> 29:30.891
I know, Dad.

29:30.893 --> 29:32.393
Do I think those drugs are hers?

29:32.395 --> 29:34.328
No. Is she protecting

29:34.330 --> 29:36.797
whomever is responsible,
at an enormous cost?

29:36.799 --> 29:39.299
Absolutely.

29:39.301 --> 29:42.002
She needs to learn that
every choice has a consequence.

29:42.004 --> 29:44.138
And what kind of mercy is that?

29:44.140 --> 29:46.373
I've got this, Dad.

29:46.375 --> 29:49.343
Halloween night, 1992,
same thing.

29:49.345 --> 29:51.211
That was a bottle of booze.

29:51.213 --> 29:53.280
But you knew whose it was,
and you wouldn't snitch.

29:53.282 --> 29:54.381
This is different.

29:54.383 --> 29:55.249
Not really.

29:55.251 --> 29:56.383
Yes, really.

29:56.385 --> 29:59.086
Possession of a fifth of tequila
is not a felony.

29:59.088 --> 30:01.622
Excuse me, boss,

30:01.624 --> 30:03.791
we have a situation
at St. Angelus.

30:06.228 --> 30:08.462
(siren wails)

30:11.500 --> 30:13.434
(woman screaming)

30:14.570 --> 30:16.170
Out of the way.
Gotta get past.

30:16.172 --> 30:18.205
(people screaming)

30:18.207 --> 30:20.007
Can you get them out of here?
Let's go. Move it. Let's go.

30:20.009 --> 30:21.542
Move.

30:21.544 --> 30:24.011
We got a 10-13,
shots fired at this location.

30:25.481 --> 30:27.147
Come on, come on.

30:27.149 --> 30:28.949
Don't get any closer!
Take it easy.

30:28.951 --> 30:30.451
No one has to get hurt, Mason.

30:30.453 --> 30:32.152
Take one step closer,

30:32.154 --> 30:34.221
and I'll blow him away, I swear!

30:34.223 --> 30:36.356
I know you don't want
to do that, Mason.

30:36.358 --> 30:37.791
You don't know
anything about me.

30:37.793 --> 30:39.193
I know Father Quinn
has helped you out

30:39.195 --> 30:40.427
the last time
that you got arrested.

30:40.429 --> 30:42.296
Shut up! Just stop talking.

30:43.432 --> 30:45.365
Mason,

30:45.367 --> 30:46.700
your mother would
not want you to do this.

30:46.702 --> 30:48.502
Don't talk to me
about my mother!

30:48.504 --> 30:51.305
You're not gonna shoot me.

30:52.408 --> 30:53.841
Father.

30:53.843 --> 30:56.276
Put that gun down.

30:56.278 --> 30:57.845
There'll be no guns
in my house.

30:57.847 --> 30:58.679
Tell him that.

30:58.681 --> 31:00.180
Don't move.

31:00.182 --> 31:01.482
Put it down, Mason, right now!

31:01.484 --> 31:03.050
FATHER QUINN:
Mason.

31:03.052 --> 31:04.551
Come on, give me the gun, Mason.

31:04.553 --> 31:05.819
Shut up!

31:05.821 --> 31:07.154
FATHER QUINN:
You don't have to do this.

31:07.156 --> 31:09.156
You're a good kid.

31:09.158 --> 31:10.524
I know you are...

31:10.526 --> 31:12.860
(grunting)

31:13.329 --> 31:15.162
(gunshot, screams)

31:16.599 --> 31:17.698
(groans)

31:22.671 --> 31:24.671
Hands behind your back.
(groaning)

31:24.673 --> 31:27.241
Other hand.

31:27.243 --> 31:28.208
Central, 12 David,

31:28.210 --> 31:29.810
need a bus forthwith
at St. Angelus,

31:29.812 --> 31:32.246
corner of 85th
and Bay Ridge Avenue,

31:32.248 --> 31:34.615
re: two males shot
at this location.

31:46.818 --> 31:48.784
Thanks for meeting with us.

31:48.786 --> 31:49.785
Have a seat.

31:49.787 --> 31:51.854
This is Nicky's mother,
Erin Reagan.

31:51.856 --> 31:54.557
I'm with
the Manhattan DA's office.

31:54.559 --> 31:55.558
I work as a Bureau Chief...

31:55.560 --> 31:57.059
Yes, I-I know

31:57.061 --> 31:58.427
who you are.

31:58.429 --> 32:00.095
I'm sure this can't be easy,

32:00.097 --> 32:02.031
sitting on the other side
of the desk.

32:02.033 --> 32:03.699
You might say that.

32:03.701 --> 32:05.234
What I was hoping

32:05.236 --> 32:06.435
is you give us a little time

32:06.437 --> 32:08.504
before you move to indict
on the charges.

32:08.506 --> 32:10.539
Because your client's
last name is Reagan?

32:10.541 --> 32:11.507
And as a Reagan,

32:11.509 --> 32:12.608
you don't have to play

32:12.610 --> 32:14.343
by the same rules
as everyone else?

32:14.345 --> 32:17.313
You don't have any evidence
the drugs are Nicky's.

32:17.315 --> 32:18.414
RATTNER:
Mr. Smith,

32:18.416 --> 32:19.715
we came in here on good faith.

32:19.717 --> 32:20.649
You came in here because

32:20.651 --> 32:22.284
you assume
you can work the system.

32:22.286 --> 32:25.221
Unlike Manhattan, Miss Reagan,

32:25.223 --> 32:26.922
we don't have a hierarchy here.

32:26.924 --> 32:28.757
In the Bronx,
we decide indictments

32:28.759 --> 32:30.159
based on the merits of the case,

32:30.161 --> 32:31.193
not the last name

32:31.195 --> 32:32.728
of the defendants.

32:32.730 --> 32:36.031
Then let's let the merits
of the case decide the outcome.

32:36.033 --> 32:37.199
Let's go, Nicky,

32:37.201 --> 32:38.434
we're done here.

32:38.436 --> 32:39.468
Wait, Mom...

32:39.470 --> 32:40.870
No.

32:41.639 --> 32:42.705
(sighs)

32:42.707 --> 32:43.706
I'll make a statement.

32:43.708 --> 32:44.673
No, you won't.

32:44.675 --> 32:46.475
I'm not allowing a statement.

32:46.477 --> 32:47.476
That's fine

32:47.478 --> 32:49.745
because Ms.Reagan-Boyle

32:49.747 --> 32:50.980
already got Kyle Miller

32:50.982 --> 32:53.048
to make a statement,
vindicating her.

32:54.452 --> 32:56.452
He did?

32:56.454 --> 32:57.820
(laughing):
Why do you sound so surprised,

32:57.822 --> 32:59.522
Ms.Reagan-Boyle?

32:59.524 --> 33:00.856
It's my understanding
that you're the one

33:00.858 --> 33:02.892
who convinced Kyle
to come forward.

33:04.128 --> 33:07.329
I'm just really glad

33:07.331 --> 33:09.031
he decided to tell the truth.

33:09.033 --> 33:10.332
I'll bet you are.

33:10.334 --> 33:11.100
RATTNER:
Don't say another word.

33:11.102 --> 33:12.568
Am I to understand

33:12.570 --> 33:14.470
that Kyle Miller
took ownership of the drugs,

33:14.472 --> 33:15.638
and you didn't notify us?

33:15.640 --> 33:16.872
I'm notifying you now.

33:16.874 --> 33:19.074
So, the charges against Nicky
have been dropped?

33:19.076 --> 33:21.076
As soon as his testimony

33:21.078 --> 33:22.545
is corroborated, yes.

33:22.547 --> 33:23.746
But I suggest

33:23.748 --> 33:26.348
you stay out of trouble
in the Bronx.

33:26.350 --> 33:29.552
And I suggest you stay
out of trouble in Manhattan.

33:38.195 --> 33:39.428
When were you going
to tell me that

33:39.430 --> 33:41.330
you got Kyle to own up
to the drugs?

33:41.332 --> 33:43.365
I didn't know it worked.

33:43.367 --> 33:45.401
What worked?

33:45.403 --> 33:46.569
I told him that my family

33:46.571 --> 33:48.037
was so upset
about the charges,

33:48.039 --> 33:49.071
that they had the baggie

33:49.073 --> 33:50.573
DNA and fingerprint tested,

33:50.575 --> 33:53.075
and they matched him,
so that his only shot

33:53.077 --> 33:56.245
at getting a deal
was to fess up.

33:56.247 --> 33:58.013
(sighs)

33:58.015 --> 34:00.149
And how did you
come up with that?

34:01.686 --> 34:03.452
My sources are confidential.

34:03.454 --> 34:06.989
Well, I don't know
whether to be angry with you

34:06.991 --> 34:08.456
or congratulate you.

34:08.458 --> 34:11.193
Well, you've been angry
with me a lot lately,

34:11.195 --> 34:12.460
and it's killing me,

34:12.463 --> 34:15.764
so how about we try
for congratulations?

34:15.766 --> 34:17.565
Congratulations.

34:17.568 --> 34:20.668
I never want
to disappoint you, Mom.

35:08.052 --> 35:09.885
How is Mason?

35:13.057 --> 35:14.223
You didn't you tell me

35:14.225 --> 35:16.358
he witnessed
his mother's murder.

35:16.360 --> 35:18.861
I couldn't.

35:18.863 --> 35:20.829
Wouldn't.

35:20.831 --> 35:23.032
Seal of the confessional.

35:23.034 --> 35:24.867
You put lives in danger.

35:24.869 --> 35:26.068
I had no choice.

35:26.070 --> 35:27.670
Oh, the hell
you didn't, Father.

35:27.672 --> 35:31.874
Look, Frank, you have
your vows to uphold,

35:31.876 --> 35:32.908
and I have mine.

35:32.910 --> 35:34.777
Innocent people
could've been killed.

35:34.779 --> 35:36.311
They weren't.

35:36.313 --> 35:38.280
Well, no thanks to Mason Reyes.

35:38.282 --> 35:39.281
Regardless,

35:39.283 --> 35:40.716
I'm glad he came forward.

35:40.718 --> 35:42.851
He didn't come forward.

35:42.853 --> 35:45.654
His father confessed to it.

35:45.656 --> 35:49.191
Kind of puts things
into perspective, huh?

35:49.193 --> 35:51.160
Why Mason was acting out...

35:51.162 --> 35:52.127
I do not consider

35:52.129 --> 35:54.296
attempted murder acting out.

35:54.298 --> 35:56.465
I failed him, Frank.

35:58.936 --> 36:02.271
Well, all the compassion
in the world can't make up

36:02.273 --> 36:03.972
for some traumas, Pete.

36:03.974 --> 36:06.108
I'm not giving up on him.

36:06.110 --> 36:08.944
I forgive him,
and I'm praying for him.

36:08.946 --> 36:09.912
Well, I'm not.

36:09.914 --> 36:11.413
Yes, you are.

36:11.415 --> 36:13.048
That's an order.

36:13.050 --> 36:14.883
You can't save everyone, Pete.

36:14.885 --> 36:19.455
Maybe not, but I gotta
be willing to die trying.

36:19.457 --> 36:20.689
Not on my watch.

36:20.691 --> 36:22.891
You ever admit
when you're wrong?

36:22.893 --> 36:25.594
Couple days in here,
eating green Jell-O,

36:25.596 --> 36:27.830
and you'll be willing
to admit I'm right.

36:27.832 --> 36:30.999
Mason Reyes did not
intend to shoot me.

36:31.001 --> 36:33.969
Well, the road to hell
is paved with you know what.

36:33.971 --> 36:36.438
And it's been my experience
that the road to heaven

36:36.440 --> 36:38.941
is paved with those same stones.

36:38.943 --> 36:40.776
You ever admit you're wrong?

36:41.645 --> 36:43.712
Why would I?

36:43.714 --> 36:45.147
I never am wrong.

36:45.149 --> 36:46.715
Me either.

37:02.166 --> 37:03.999
Just sit them all
down over here, okay?

37:04.001 --> 37:04.967
Come on.

37:04.969 --> 37:06.335
Danny, what the hell
is going on?

37:06.337 --> 37:07.503
Why did you
arrest them all?

37:07.505 --> 37:08.804
What do you mean?

37:08.806 --> 37:10.706
They all were confessing,
so we didn't have any option.

37:10.708 --> 37:12.074
Give me a break.

37:12.076 --> 37:13.642
Well, it's true, and it worked.

37:13.644 --> 37:14.877
We figured out
who the killer is.

37:14.879 --> 37:16.478
Did you?

37:16.480 --> 37:17.479
Yeah.

37:17.481 --> 37:18.480
We even found the gun.

37:18.482 --> 37:19.648
Yeah, it's being tested.

37:19.650 --> 37:22.651
You know you've compromised
my entire case.

37:22.653 --> 37:25.020
Well, I didn't mean to.

37:25.022 --> 37:27.756
Okay, Sherlock, who did it?

37:27.758 --> 37:29.191
Martina Fernandez,

37:29.193 --> 37:30.592
but it was in self-defense.

37:30.594 --> 37:33.462
Yup, and she's lawyered up now,
so...

37:33.464 --> 37:36.064
I can't believe you arrested
all of them on purpose.

37:36.066 --> 37:37.499
It was a strategy.

37:37.501 --> 37:39.067
A strategy?
Mm-hmm.

37:39.069 --> 37:40.669
To make sure
that she got a deal?

37:40.671 --> 37:44.473
When you hear her story
for yourself, I promise you,

37:44.475 --> 37:46.175
you're gonna want
to give her a deal, too.

37:46.177 --> 37:48.243
Okay, well, now I don't
really have a choice, do I?

37:48.245 --> 37:50.078
Not if I did my job right.

37:50.080 --> 37:51.647
(sighs)

38:02.860 --> 38:05.561
So, how long is Father Quinn
gonna be out of commission?

38:05.563 --> 38:07.362
I guess he'll...
about a week.

38:07.364 --> 38:08.897
I heard if that bullet
had gone one inch

38:08.899 --> 38:10.299
in either direction,
he wouldn't have made it.

38:10.301 --> 38:12.568
It'd take more than
a bullet to finish him off.

38:12.570 --> 38:13.936
He's a tough old goat.

38:13.938 --> 38:15.437
HENRY:
Francis.

38:15.439 --> 38:17.239
You're talking about a priest.

38:17.241 --> 38:18.674
Reverend Father old goat.

38:18.676 --> 38:19.908
He's been calling

38:19.910 --> 38:21.677
the DA's office,
wanting to monitor

38:21.679 --> 38:23.679
what's going on
with Mason Reyes.

38:23.681 --> 38:25.247
Reyes looking
at serious time?

38:25.249 --> 38:26.481
He's being charged
with larceny,

38:26.483 --> 38:28.083
criminal possession
of a weapon

38:28.085 --> 38:29.117
and attempted murder.

38:29.119 --> 38:30.652
So he's going to prison?

38:30.654 --> 38:32.821
Well, in all probability,
as well he should.

38:32.823 --> 38:34.456
But there are
mitigating factors.

38:34.458 --> 38:35.958
Yeah, I don't see
how that works.

38:35.960 --> 38:37.392
How can different people
charged with the same crime

38:37.394 --> 38:38.427
get different sentences?

38:38.429 --> 38:39.795
It's the degree of guilt,

38:39.797 --> 38:40.896
if there's a history,

38:40.898 --> 38:41.964
was there intent?

38:41.966 --> 38:44.366
Some people deserve mercy,
others do not.

38:46.537 --> 38:48.704
So, it was you
who coached Nicky.

38:48.706 --> 38:50.138
What, no.

38:50.140 --> 38:51.707
Mom, we've talked about this.

38:51.709 --> 38:53.809
And I have the right to know.

38:53.811 --> 38:55.878
All I said is that she
shouldn't try talking to Dad,

38:55.880 --> 38:57.446
because he can't get
involved anyway.

38:57.448 --> 38:59.648
So it was you?

38:59.650 --> 39:03.518
No. No, it was not me.

39:03.520 --> 39:04.753
Wasn't you what?

39:04.755 --> 39:05.821
Nicky did a bluff

39:05.823 --> 39:07.155
that only a seasoned
cop could have known,

39:07.157 --> 39:08.190
and I want to know

39:08.192 --> 39:09.157
who's responsible.

39:09.159 --> 39:10.459
It wasn't me.

39:10.461 --> 39:12.094
I swear.
And not for nothing,

39:12.096 --> 39:14.963
but Jamie and I are not
the only two cops at the table.

39:18.235 --> 39:20.769
DANNY:
Just saying.

39:20.771 --> 39:23.772
Well, it certainly wasn't me.

39:26.944 --> 39:28.310
Don't look at me.

39:28.312 --> 39:29.444
You told me to stay out of it.

39:29.446 --> 39:30.279
And did you?

39:30.281 --> 39:32.447
My conscience is clear.

39:32.449 --> 39:33.582
That's not what I asked.

39:33.584 --> 39:35.784
500 feet back,
just like you said.

39:35.786 --> 39:36.919
Dad...

39:36.921 --> 39:38.487
I didn't talk to Grandpa,
Mom, I swear.

39:38.489 --> 39:39.454
Thank you.

39:39.456 --> 39:41.657
Then who?

39:42.660 --> 39:44.993
I got a call
from Lieutenant Gormley.

39:46.764 --> 39:50.499
Oh, my gosh,
he will get a stern talking-to,

39:50.501 --> 39:52.434
first thing tomorrow morning.

39:58.943 --> 40:00.175
So, what's for dessert?

40:01.278 --> 40:03.779
LINDA:
We do have some apple pie.

40:03.781 --> 40:06.281
DANNY: If it's not covered in
chocolate, I'm not interested.

40:06.283 --> 40:07.283
