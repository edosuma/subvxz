WEBVTT

00:00.276 --> 00:04.050
There is some evidence to suggest
that Hayley... was strangled.

00:04.075 --> 00:05.915
DCI Stuart,
Hayley was a friend of mine.

00:05.977 --> 00:08.260
I was supposed to be doing
a cleaning job,

00:08.288 --> 00:10.168
Hayley did the job for me.

00:10.196 --> 00:11.768
It was in a holiday rental.

00:11.838 --> 00:13.813
I'd forgotten
that's who we let it to.

00:13.865 --> 00:16.105
He does that quiz show on the BBC.
James Hollis.

00:16.129 --> 00:18.396
Just give me ten minutes,
I'm not feeling 100%.

00:18.421 --> 00:20.029
Dad, this is not about the past.

00:20.074 --> 00:21.954
Or, at least, not the past
you're talking about.

00:21.979 --> 00:23.779
I love you.
I love you, too.

00:23.964 --> 00:25.549
Tim, it's your word against hers.

00:25.600 --> 00:28.416
I pretended to go out.
I just heard him go for her.

00:28.460 --> 00:30.140
I don't believe
I ever lost my temper.

00:30.487 --> 00:32.256
I'd appreciate having somebody here.

00:32.281 --> 00:34.483
They took money
I had for a deposit on a flat.

00:34.545 --> 00:36.905
I do think you should consider
opening a bank account.

00:36.940 --> 00:38.890
No. No. No. No. No bank accounts.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.400
I would feel very lucky to be able
to help you grow stronger.

00:41.480 --> 00:43.493
There'll be money
in the joint account tomorrow.

00:43.548 --> 00:47.258
Mr Carr sold my father a cash ISA.
We want to cancel it.

00:47.283 --> 00:48.935
I can't see any paperwork here.

00:49.061 --> 00:51.581
Mr Hollis, we wondered
if you had five minutes, please,

00:51.680 --> 00:53.440
to help us with a case
we're investigating.

00:53.569 --> 00:55.096
I will need my lawyer present.

00:55.152 --> 00:56.752
Els, it's Dad again.

00:56.850 --> 00:58.869
They've come about her.

Dad!
Yeah?

02:04.960 --> 02:06.160
Morning.

02:07.440 --> 02:10.400
Blimey! Are you all right?
You left a pan on.

02:10.560 --> 02:12.560
Me? No.

02:12.760 --> 02:15.960
Yeah, I walked in
and it was burning.

02:16.120 --> 02:17.960
Is that your porridge?

02:18.120 --> 02:19.840
This was off when I left.

02:20.040 --> 02:22.760
Right. Well, I've, like,
literally just walked in.

02:22.920 --> 02:24.080
So...

02:24.280 --> 02:26.960
Well, it's still under warranty.
I'll get in touch with the company.

02:33.960 --> 02:37.120
I'm sorry. If I knew anything,
I'd tell you, Mr Hollis.

02:37.320 --> 02:39.520
You know I would.
I do. But if you do hear anything,

02:39.680 --> 02:41.000
tell him I need to speak to him.

02:41.160 --> 02:42.920
Tell him it's really urgent.

02:52.040 --> 02:53.560
And, so, in the end,

02:53.760 --> 02:57.560
the case really came down to
one person's word against another's.

02:57.720 --> 02:59.280
And in this instance,

02:59.480 --> 03:03.680
we feel bound to consider Dr Finch's
many years' exemplary practice

03:03.720 --> 03:07.280
and his reputation
as a hard-working, generous

03:07.440 --> 03:08.760
and trustworthy GP.

03:09.920 --> 03:13.440
And as such, we find
we do not uphold the complaint.

03:13.640 --> 03:17.280
I heard him. He might sit there now
looking like butter wouldn't melt,

03:17.440 --> 03:20.200
but he's got another side to him.

03:20.360 --> 03:23.520
Yeah, you look embarrassed, mate.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.520
You should, cos you're a disgrace!

03:46.080 --> 03:47.200
Guv...

03:47.400 --> 03:48.840
Yeah?
He is here...

03:55.840 --> 03:58.000
'Peter, its Mark Harper.

03:58.200 --> 04:00.480
'Kate and I can find no record
of any paperwork

04:00.680 --> 04:02.920
'relating to an ISA
in the name of Salthouse

04:03.120 --> 04:06.120
'and I need to know today
how a three-grand cheque from him

04:06.280 --> 04:07.720
'has been cashed.

04:07.880 --> 04:09.480
'So you really need to call me.'

04:20.279 --> 04:21.640
There.

04:53.160 --> 04:55.080
OK, er...

04:55.280 --> 04:57.440
..I'm going to change
all of your settings

04:57.480 --> 04:59.280
so that only your friends
can comment.

05:00.480 --> 05:03.760
What does it make them feel
when they say those things?

05:03.960 --> 05:05.880
I doubt very much
they feel anything at all, Mum.

05:08.400 --> 05:09.760
Cos they're messed up.

05:10.840 --> 05:15.480
And that, that isn't about Dad
or about you or Hayley.

05:15.640 --> 05:16.880
It's about them.

05:19.600 --> 05:23.040
It's just a mirror people hold up
to themselves to shout at.

05:26.760 --> 05:31.680
I wanted, if I may, erm,
to ask you about a house you rented

05:31.840 --> 05:34.920
in Middenham, in December 1999,

05:35.080 --> 05:36.440
which I believe...

05:37.480 --> 05:38.880
..was an eight-bedroom house.

05:40.640 --> 05:44.080
Yes, I can't remember specifically
but, yes, it was big.

05:44.280 --> 05:46.800
There were a bunch of us.
Three other families?

05:47.000 --> 05:48.600
Yes, although,
for the first few days,

05:48.760 --> 05:50.280
there were only me and three mates.

05:50.480 --> 05:53.760
Erm, our wives and kids
joined us on New Year's Eve.

05:53.920 --> 05:55.200
Right.

05:55.360 --> 05:57.360
It was primarily a golfing break.

05:57.520 --> 05:59.320
Oh, OK.

05:59.520 --> 06:02.560
Erm, and what were their names,
please, the men?

06:03.760 --> 06:05.320
Tim Finch.

06:06.600 --> 06:07.720
Chris Lowe.

06:08.760 --> 06:09.760
Pete Carr.

06:11.360 --> 06:13.640
And are they all still around?
Yep.

06:13.800 --> 06:15.400
Still friends?

06:15.600 --> 06:19.280
Yes, we were at school together,
so it's a long connection.

06:19.480 --> 06:23.000
And the families, erm, can you
give me details of those people?

06:24.200 --> 06:27.320
Tim was there
with his first wife Derran

06:27.480 --> 06:31.360
and their, er... two little girls.

06:31.560 --> 06:33.720
Pete was single at that time,
so on his own.

06:33.760 --> 06:37.240
And Chris Lowe was with his first
wife Laura and their little girl.

06:39.400 --> 06:41.040
And your wife?

06:42.680 --> 06:45.560
Yes, my wife Mel
and our little boy Eliot.

06:45.760 --> 06:47.680
Are you two still together?
No.

06:47.840 --> 06:49.720
I remarried a few years ago.

06:49.880 --> 06:50.880
Oh.

06:53.240 --> 06:55.880
So, this is a photo of Hayley Reid.

06:59.200 --> 07:00.600
Do you recognise her?

07:05.080 --> 07:06.880
Yes.

07:07.080 --> 07:10.520
And is that just from the papers?
Sorry, where is this heading?

07:10.680 --> 07:11.920
SHE SIGHS

07:12.120 --> 07:15.440
We're just trying to corroborate
evidence from another witness,

07:15.640 --> 07:20.400
who thinks Hayley might have cleaned
the house you rented.

07:22.120 --> 07:24.600
I have no recollection of that.
You never saw her there?

07:24.760 --> 07:25.800
No.

07:25.960 --> 07:28.080
I mean, we were out most days,

07:28.280 --> 07:32.120
but, hey, this story was huge
and her photo was all over the TV.

07:32.320 --> 07:35.840
So, if she had cleaned our house
and any of us had have seen her,

07:36.040 --> 07:39.160
then I think someone would have
mentioned something. Absolutely.

07:43.240 --> 07:45.480
When did you return to London,
Mr Hollis?

07:45.680 --> 07:49.040
Erm, when the rental ended,
which would be...

07:49.240 --> 07:52.080
..perhaps, er,
around the second or third.

07:52.280 --> 07:54.680
And you drove back up
with your wife and child? Yes.

07:56.280 --> 07:59.040
How did they got down there
on the 31st?

07:59.240 --> 08:01.480
Train. I picked them up
from a nearby station.

08:05.320 --> 08:07.760
OK. And this is the last question.

08:07.960 --> 08:12.680
Erm... what did you all get up to
on the Millennium evening?

08:14.640 --> 08:18.360
Erm...
Well, as I remember, we, er...

08:18.560 --> 08:21.080
..we had a meal in the house,
all together.

08:22.480 --> 08:24.320
Then, I think the, erm...

08:25.680 --> 08:29.440
..the children stayed up a bit,
till about nine or ten.

08:29.600 --> 08:33.520
I think the adults watched a movie

08:33.720 --> 08:36.960
and then all went to bed
after Big Ben.

08:37.159 --> 08:40.000
Is that all of you?
As I recall, yes.

08:41.080 --> 08:44.800
And then no-one went out again
for the rest of the night?

08:44.960 --> 08:46.000
No.

08:48.800 --> 08:50.120
OK.

08:51.360 --> 08:52.720
That's it.

08:52.920 --> 08:56.000
Thank you.
Thank you very much for your time.

09:03.600 --> 09:05.080
Sorry...

09:05.280 --> 09:07.600
You said you guys met at school.
Yes.

09:07.800 --> 09:10.000
Where was that,
the school you went to? Finchley.

09:10.160 --> 09:13.200
Right. And you all, erm...

09:13.400 --> 09:15.720
..lived round that area?
Within a couple of miles, yes.

09:15.880 --> 09:17.400
OK, thanks again.

09:24.640 --> 09:26.920
Well, I think we want
to know more about four guys

09:26.978 --> 09:28.978
who grew up
half a mile from her grave.

09:29.030 --> 09:30.150
I think we do.

09:40.100 --> 09:41.580
Hollis, you wanker.

09:43.500 --> 09:44.500
Shit!

09:56.260 --> 09:59.100
And this sort of sized garden
is very unusual

09:59.260 --> 10:01.380
for a flat in this part of the city.

10:01.540 --> 10:03.220
It's also west-facing, so...

10:05.200 --> 10:08.960
Anyway, have a natter
and I'll be outside if you need me.

10:09.300 --> 10:10.500
Thank you.

10:14.540 --> 10:16.900
He's never had a garden
with grass before.

10:17.060 --> 10:19.180
You like it.

10:19.220 --> 10:21.100
I think it's perfect.

10:21.260 --> 10:22.380
What?

10:22.540 --> 10:24.740
There's a "but" coming.

10:25.839 --> 10:26.934
But...

10:28.126 --> 10:31.126
..if we're going to be
properly together...

10:33.080 --> 10:35.080
..I need to know who you are, Chris.

10:37.500 --> 10:39.060
Who I am?

10:40.175 --> 10:42.975
How does someone like you, so...

10:43.150 --> 10:46.510
..brilliant, so lovely...

10:48.380 --> 10:50.260
..end up like you have?

10:50.420 --> 10:51.940
How does that happen?

11:30.300 --> 11:32.900
So we had two key leads
that I believed

11:33.100 --> 11:36.140
were potentially significant,
but were never resolved.

11:36.300 --> 11:38.100
St Matthew's C of E,

11:38.300 --> 11:40.460
which was burgled at some
point that New Year's Eve,

11:40.500 --> 11:42.940
with about five grand's worth
of 18-century silverware

11:43.140 --> 11:44.980
taken from a locked cupboard
in the vestry.

11:45.180 --> 11:48.580
Blood smears were retrieved on
some smashed glass into the vestry,

11:48.780 --> 11:51.260
but there were no matches
with anyone on our database.

11:52.500 --> 11:54.900
The church
is about halfway between The Swan

11:55.100 --> 11:57.260
and Hayley's parents'
original house.

11:57.420 --> 12:00.140
And one possible theory was that

12:00.340 --> 12:02.180
she saw something after
she left work,

12:02.380 --> 12:06.180
she went to investigate and
ran into the burglar or burglars.

12:06.380 --> 12:09.140
Certainly, I believe
it's worth following up again.

12:10.580 --> 12:12.540
And then a black car,

12:12.740 --> 12:15.540
which was seen driving
very erratically on the road

12:15.700 --> 12:18.220
between The Swan and her house

12:18.380 --> 12:20.500
at approximately 12:25,

12:20.540 --> 12:23.460
maybe 15 minutes after we know
she left the pub.

12:23.620 --> 12:25.060
No reg or make,

12:25.260 --> 12:27.900
but the witness thought
it was a black four-door saloon

12:28.060 --> 12:29.380
with a tow bar.

12:29.580 --> 12:32.380
Oh, and it's worth mentioning that
the weather was very bad that night,

12:32.580 --> 12:35.220
with heavy rain
from about 11 o'clock onwards

12:35.380 --> 12:37.860
and very poor visibility.

12:38.020 --> 12:39.020
That's it.

12:40.260 --> 12:43.660
So John will be available
for the rest of the day,

12:43.860 --> 12:46.220
and then on the phone,
at any point, for any questions.

12:46.380 --> 12:47.820
But given what he's just told us,

12:48.020 --> 12:51.580
I suggest DNA swabs should be taken
from any suspects we speak to.

12:52.620 --> 12:55.540
Thank you again, John.
That was very useful.

12:55.700 --> 12:57.220
So...

12:57.380 --> 12:59.260
..specific points of action.

13:00.380 --> 13:03.620
Fran, can you double-check
all these timelines, please,

13:03.820 --> 13:06.020
for Hayley's movements
on the night of her disappearance

13:06.220 --> 13:08.380
and the week before?
Boss.

13:08.580 --> 13:12.060
Murray, you take the witness
who saw this car. Yup.

13:12.260 --> 13:15.220
And, Jake, obviously,
the body was found in London

13:15.380 --> 13:17.780
and, given that new development,

13:17.980 --> 13:20.940
it's worth having another chat
with Adrian Mullery, I think. Guv.

13:21.140 --> 13:24.300
And following this morning's
interview with James Hollis,

13:24.500 --> 13:27.140
myself and DI Khan
will certainly be speaking

13:27.340 --> 13:30.740
to the other three male occupants
of The Spinney.

13:32.420 --> 13:34.580
OK, that's it. Thank you, everyone.

13:36.540 --> 13:38.980
That was great. Thank you again.

13:39.140 --> 13:40.420
Yeah. No problem.

13:40.620 --> 13:42.500
So are you heading back down tonight
or...?

13:42.700 --> 13:45.100
No. No, no, my kids
live with their mum in town,

13:45.300 --> 13:49.820
so I'm going to stick around, spend
some time with them for a few days.

13:50.020 --> 13:52.300
Right. How old are they?
21 and 20.

13:52.460 --> 13:53.820
Ah, same as mine. Boys or...?

13:53.980 --> 13:55.420
Two boys.

13:55.580 --> 13:56.620
Jinx.

13:56.780 --> 13:58.060
Hm!

13:58.260 --> 14:00.940
Er, anyway, I better go
and check into the hotel, so...

14:01.140 --> 14:03.540
Go for it. And we will speak soon,
I hope. Yeah, absolutely.

14:04.780 --> 14:06.660
John... Thanks for that.
That was great.

14:06.860 --> 14:09.260
Listen, er... if you're at
a loose end any evening,

14:09.460 --> 14:11.900
there's always a few of us
at The Enterprise,

14:12.100 --> 14:13.860
if you fancy a drink.
It's just opposite.

14:14.020 --> 14:15.660
Yeah, great. Cheers.

14:15.860 --> 14:17.180
I might take you up on that.
Good.

14:17.260 --> 14:18.540
All right, see you.
See you.

14:18.740 --> 14:20.220
See you.
Cheers.

14:22.300 --> 14:25.220
You're welcome.

14:28.940 --> 14:30.940
Oh!

14:32.580 --> 14:35.780
Hola, gordo conejo.
Hola, muy gordo conejo.

14:35.980 --> 14:38.900
How you doing?
Yeah, all good. You?

14:39.100 --> 14:42.100
Yeah, very well. I've just been
in Manchester on a work thing,

14:42.260 --> 14:44.020
driving back to Sussex now with Caz.

14:44.220 --> 14:46.380
Oh, right. Give her my love.
I will.

14:46.420 --> 14:49.180
But listen, very quickly,
I presume you've seen the news

14:49.340 --> 14:50.780
about the Hayley Reid case.

14:50.980 --> 14:54.220
Yeah, I did. It's very sad.
Oh, wasn't it?

14:54.420 --> 14:57.220
Anyway, the police are obviously
doing a general trawl

14:57.380 --> 14:59.260
for potential new witnesses.

14:59.460 --> 15:02.820
And they spoke to me this morning
about the house we rented.

15:02.980 --> 15:04.460
Right.

15:04.660 --> 15:07.740
Apparently they think
she may have been our cleaner. Wow!

15:07.940 --> 15:09.700
I said I couldn't recall us
having a cleaner

15:09.900 --> 15:12.260
and I certainly think one of us
would have noticed

15:12.460 --> 15:15.020
if it had have been her, given
the amount of coverage. Indeed.

15:15.180 --> 15:17.180
Anyway, the long and short is

15:17.380 --> 15:20.500
they're probably going to want to
speak to the whole gang of us, so...

15:20.700 --> 15:22.620
..I just thought
that I ought to let you know.

15:22.780 --> 15:24.020
Yeah, no worries.

15:24.220 --> 15:25.860
Obviously,
they're looking for people

15:26.060 --> 15:29.660
who may have seen something
that only now seems relevant.

15:29.860 --> 15:32.380
But I told them we all
stayed in the house that night,

15:32.540 --> 15:34.660
eating with our families, so...

15:34.820 --> 15:36.540
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

15:36.740 --> 15:39.420
I'll give Pete a bell and maybe
you could give Chris the heads up?

15:39.580 --> 15:40.580
Sure.

15:40.740 --> 15:42.500
And I've e-mailed some dates
for our meet-up.

15:42.580 --> 15:44.380
Oh, yeah, I saw. Erm...

15:44.580 --> 15:46.740
..I can do any of those.
Excellent!

15:46.780 --> 15:48.500
Speak soon, mate.

15:48.660 --> 15:50.140
Yeah, cheers, Jamie.

15:53.420 --> 15:55.060
Jamie sends his love.

15:55.220 --> 15:57.060
How is he?

15:57.220 --> 15:58.740
Oh, he's very well.

15:58.940 --> 16:01.780
He's just, er... trying to arrange
a get-together.

16:01.940 --> 16:03.620
The four amigos.

16:03.780 --> 16:05.340
That'll be nice.

16:05.500 --> 16:06.820
Yeah, it will.

16:06.980 --> 16:09.100
It's been too long. Much too long.

16:11.980 --> 16:13.460
Of course I remember.

16:13.660 --> 16:15.740
I was meant to have bought
the puddings and I forgot,

16:15.780 --> 16:18.340
so I legged it to the corner shop
and bought a load of Cornettos,

16:18.380 --> 16:20.340
which your ex
wasn't too happy about.

16:20.540 --> 16:23.460
Anyway, I just wanted to check that
you remembered it the same as I did.

16:23.620 --> 16:25.460
So, we're all ready for the 22nd.

16:25.660 --> 16:28.980
Chris has replied now so I'll book
a table and send you all a link.

16:29.180 --> 16:31.620
Just one quick thing before you go,
Jamie.

16:31.820 --> 16:34.140
Actually, I'm literally
just heading into a meeting, mate.

16:34.300 --> 16:35.900
Yeah, yeah, I'll be ten seconds.

16:36.060 --> 16:38.260
Jamie... I need a massive favour.

16:41.540 --> 16:43.380
I was married for, er...

16:43.540 --> 16:45.460
..12 years

16:45.620 --> 16:47.780
and I had... have, I have a daughter,

16:47.940 --> 16:49.420
Maya,

16:49.580 --> 16:52.020
who I last saw 17 years ago.

16:53.780 --> 16:56.900
My marriage ended early 2000.

16:58.820 --> 17:01.580
And because of some issues
that I had at the time,

17:01.740 --> 17:03.380
my wife Laura,

17:03.580 --> 17:06.339
she felt it was damaging for Maya
to be around that.

17:06.500 --> 17:09.060
And I'd run up some debts.

17:09.260 --> 17:12.819
So I went from living in
a nice house in Notting Hill to...

17:12.980 --> 17:14.859
..a one-bedroom flat in Acton...

17:16.500 --> 17:18.660
..and then a hostel and...

17:20.180 --> 17:22.099
..and then the streets.

17:22.260 --> 17:23.540
How long were you homeless?

17:25.380 --> 17:27.780
On and off for seven years.

17:27.940 --> 17:29.260
Oh, Chris...

17:30.500 --> 17:33.100
I'm so sorry.

17:33.300 --> 17:35.220
And you had no friends
who could have helped you?

17:35.260 --> 17:37.940
Yeah. Yeah. I had friends who would
have been desperate to help me.

17:38.140 --> 17:41.020
Yeah, but you have to want
to be helped. And I didn't.

17:41.220 --> 17:44.820
I hated myself. I thought I deserved
everything that happened to me.

17:44.980 --> 17:46.420
And your marriage...

17:47.660 --> 17:49.940
..the issues you mention?

17:50.100 --> 17:51.420
OK, so...

17:51.620 --> 17:54.660
..as you know,
I have bipolar disorder,

17:54.860 --> 17:57.740
which was undiagnosed at the time,
and so it was unmedicated,

17:57.900 --> 17:59.380
which meant that...

18:00.420 --> 18:03.860
..you know, my behaviour
was... challenging.

18:04.980 --> 18:07.140
And as soon as I started
costing my company money,

18:07.180 --> 18:09.340
it was inevitable
I'd be asked to step down.

18:12.940 --> 18:15.700
And that was
just not what she had married,

18:15.900 --> 18:18.260
an unemployed man
who had mental health issues.

18:20.180 --> 18:21.740
So she asked me to leave.

18:23.500 --> 18:24.900
And I did.

18:26.140 --> 18:28.940
And then, 18 months later,
she married a hedge fund manager,

18:29.140 --> 18:31.100
who bought her a house
in Holland Park, so...

18:34.340 --> 18:36.500
And then, in 2012...

18:37.900 --> 18:42.420
..Maya wrote to tell me that
Laura had died from breast cancer...

18:43.740 --> 18:45.740
..and to ask that I stay away
from the funeral.

18:47.380 --> 18:50.380
I thought about writing back,
and saying that I was better now,

18:50.540 --> 18:52.180
that I was a different person.

18:52.340 --> 18:53.660
And I am.

18:55.620 --> 18:57.180
But I think there comes a time

18:57.380 --> 18:59.380
when you have to accept
how things have turned out.

19:00.900 --> 19:03.540
That life can sometimes
simply be unfair.

19:04.780 --> 19:06.500
And to keep resisting that...

19:07.660 --> 19:10.100
..it takes so much energy, Mila.

19:11.500 --> 19:14.540
Energy that you need for the future.

19:30.460 --> 19:32.100
Love?

19:32.260 --> 19:33.820
In here.

19:35.220 --> 19:36.580
Hey, Pete.

19:37.700 --> 19:39.140
Hello, Mark.

19:39.300 --> 19:41.420
What a lovely lady your missus is.

19:42.900 --> 19:44.060
I was just about to call you.

19:44.260 --> 19:46.700
You're punching above your weight
there, buddy.

19:51.940 --> 19:53.340
Three grand.

19:53.500 --> 19:54.820
And my apologies.

19:56.580 --> 19:59.580
I was stressed about some deals
and screwed up the paperwork.

19:59.780 --> 20:03.300
I accidentally paid Salthouse's
cheque into my personal account.

20:03.460 --> 20:05.180
But, er...

20:06.500 --> 20:07.780
..there it is.

20:09.460 --> 20:10.780
All there.

20:16.340 --> 20:19.140
You know what we used to call
blokes like Pete, Maria?

20:21.100 --> 20:22.540
Filth.

20:23.740 --> 20:26.300
Failed in London, tried Hong-Kong.

20:26.500 --> 20:28.740
Bit of a Wild West out there,
wasn't it, mate?

20:28.940 --> 20:31.180
Attracted a very distinct
sort of person.

20:32.620 --> 20:34.380
I see you, buddy.

20:38.860 --> 20:41.300
Lovely to meet you, Maria.
I'll let myself out.

20:50.380 --> 20:51.820
I'm sorry about that.

20:56.700 --> 20:58.100
I need a shower.

21:00.380 --> 21:01.940
This isn't working, Pete.

21:03.380 --> 21:04.940
You and me.

21:07.100 --> 21:08.540
I'm sorry, but...

21:10.380 --> 21:12.540
..this just isn't what I thought
I was buying.

21:13.759 --> 21:15.199
It'll get better, babes.

21:17.260 --> 21:18.940
Trust me.

21:20.151 --> 21:22.431
I've got some really good business
coming in.

21:43.120 --> 21:46.620
Oh, I forgot to say, I've got
a couple of guests arriving.

21:46.965 --> 21:48.605
Can you show them in, please, Liz?

21:48.679 --> 21:49.785
Yes.

21:50.531 --> 21:52.131
Thanks.

22:04.681 --> 22:06.361
Adrian...

22:07.585 --> 22:09.425
Have you got five minutes?

22:24.240 --> 22:26.680
Well, obviously I recognise her,

22:26.739 --> 22:29.777
but I don't recall ever seeing her
at the house at any point.

22:30.464 --> 22:31.655
As Jamie said,

22:31.680 --> 22:34.824
if we had have seen her, we would
have discussed it at the time.

22:34.899 --> 22:37.179
It was a huge story.
Absolutely.

22:39.840 --> 22:41.360
Er, so...

22:41.560 --> 22:45.200
..Mr Hollis, he told us
that the four of you had gone down

22:45.400 --> 22:48.240
on your own, at first, to play golf.
Yes.

22:49.800 --> 22:54.854
And then your wife Derran
and your girls arrived on the 31st.

22:55.112 --> 22:56.215
Yes.

22:56.318 --> 22:58.598
And how old were they, the kids?

22:58.680 --> 23:02.040
Er, Claire would have been eight

23:02.200 --> 23:04.080
and Emma just turned ten.

23:04.280 --> 23:06.080
I'm sorry,
just to go back on one thing.

23:06.280 --> 23:10.160
New Year's, the kids
would have gone to bed at...?

23:10.320 --> 23:12.520
Er, nine, ten, maybe.

23:13.560 --> 23:16.680
And no-one went out after that?
Nope.

23:18.160 --> 23:20.320
What car where you driving
back then, Dr Finch?

23:21.760 --> 23:23.640
Erm...

23:23.800 --> 23:27.240
..I had my Audi in '99, I think.

23:27.400 --> 23:28.840
An A4.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.880
Sorry, was that the saloon or...?

23:31.080 --> 23:35.840
No, the estate. We needed
the space for holidays and stuff.

23:36.040 --> 23:39.520
To save faffing around with a
top box or a trailer or any of that.

23:40.640 --> 23:41.920
And what colour was it?

23:43.200 --> 23:44.720
Silver.

23:44.920 --> 23:49.240
And your wife and kids,
they went down by train?

23:49.400 --> 23:51.600
With Jamie's wife and son.

23:53.680 --> 23:56.920
And everybody headed back to London
on the 2nd? Yes.

23:59.080 --> 24:00.520
Did you all live in London then?

24:00.680 --> 24:02.680
All except Pete.

24:02.840 --> 24:04.600
He lived in Hong Kong.

24:08.400 --> 24:10.600
And your marriage to Derran,
that ended when?

24:13.320 --> 24:16.880
What relevance has
when my marriage ended to anything?

24:18.880 --> 24:21.960
Sorry. If any question
makes you feel uncomfortable,

24:22.120 --> 24:23.600
you don't have to answer.

24:23.760 --> 24:27.280
We separated in 2001.

24:27.440 --> 24:28.600
OK.

24:29.720 --> 24:32.680
And do you remember when Mr Hollis
and his wife separated?

24:32.840 --> 24:35.680
Same year, I think. Or maybe 2000.

24:35.840 --> 24:37.640
And Chris Lowe and his wife?

24:37.800 --> 24:40.320
Yeah, roughly the same time.

24:42.120 --> 24:44.080
And are you still in contact
with Derran,

24:44.240 --> 24:46.440
if we wanted to speak with her?

24:46.640 --> 24:48.440
I haven't seen Derran
for many years,

24:48.640 --> 24:50.800
but I can get a number from my kids,
if you need it.

24:50.840 --> 24:52.440
That would be very helpful,
thank you.

24:52.600 --> 24:55.520
Oh, I should just say that, er...

24:56.640 --> 25:01.840
..she's had a number of issues
over the last couple of decades,

25:02.000 --> 25:04.520
depression, anxiety and so, erm...

25:04.720 --> 25:07.000
..I'm not entirely sure
you'll find her

25:07.160 --> 25:08.680
the most reliable of narrators.

25:08.840 --> 25:09.840
OK.

25:10.880 --> 25:12.480
Well, thank you for that.

25:14.080 --> 25:16.080
And then, one last thing,

25:16.240 --> 25:18.560
and, er... I should say,

25:18.720 --> 25:20.280
do feel free to say no.

25:21.320 --> 25:24.160
But in order to help
eliminate you from our enquiries,

25:24.360 --> 25:26.640
how would you feel about
giving us a DNA swab?

25:27.880 --> 25:29.240
Yes, of course. No problem.

25:31.520 --> 25:35.360
So, if nobody went out after ten,
then it can't be them.

25:35.560 --> 25:38.360
I mean, we know Hayley
was seen alive at 12:10, so...

25:39.560 --> 25:41.240
Yeah, I think you're right.

25:42.400 --> 25:44.400
And if we're spinning our wheels
on these guys,

25:44.560 --> 25:46.360
I don't want to waste any more time.

25:46.520 --> 25:48.120
Let's take the last two separately.

25:49.240 --> 25:50.880
Hi, Dad, it's me.

25:51.960 --> 25:53.960
Look, I'm really sorry,
I'm going to be a bit late.

25:56.280 --> 25:58.400
Please... call me.

26:09.920 --> 26:12.600
How many times
have you been here before, Jamie?

26:12.760 --> 26:14.200
It'll be fine.

26:15.520 --> 26:17.520
You know,
the longer this goes on...

26:18.640 --> 26:20.200
..the more his problems...

26:21.600 --> 26:22.920
..consume him.

26:24.120 --> 26:28.360
The more you look at the paths we
took, the choices we made, I made...

26:29.640 --> 26:30.800
..and think...

26:32.320 --> 26:33.760
..was it then?

26:33.920 --> 26:35.800
Was it that choice...

26:35.960 --> 26:37.720
..or that choice...

26:37.880 --> 26:39.680
..that messed everything up?

26:39.840 --> 26:41.320
Was it then...

26:43.080 --> 26:44.680
..that I ruined my child's life?

26:52.520 --> 26:54.160
Call me.

27:07.880 --> 27:09.880
Sometimes, I just...

27:10.080 --> 27:11.400
Hi...
Hello.

27:11.600 --> 27:13.920
Gemma left some school books
at mine, I brought them round.

27:14.040 --> 27:16.800
And then she wanted to show me
her room. Right.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.920
Lovely place, though.
Thank you.

27:20.640 --> 27:22.760
Anyway, I need to shoot off.

27:24.080 --> 27:26.240
Nice to see you.
And you.

27:26.400 --> 27:27.640
Bye, girls.

27:29.280 --> 27:31.440
Bye.
Bye.

27:35.760 --> 27:39.680
Yeah, well, you see, I'm from the
clip-round-the-ear-hole generation.

27:39.880 --> 27:42.480
I think he'd still like to,
to be honest. Oh, dear.

27:42.680 --> 27:44.400
And do you have children?
No!

27:44.560 --> 27:46.520
Never had the urge to be a mother.

27:46.720 --> 27:49.080
Wow. Smart move.
Tell me about it.

27:49.280 --> 27:51.240
They take so much from you,
don't they?

27:51.440 --> 27:54.160
Not sure I'd see it quite like.
Just, I'm too selfish, I think.

27:54.360 --> 27:56.240
Yeah?
Liked my career too much.

27:56.440 --> 27:59.600
I think, if you are going to have
children, you need to be around.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.160
Whoops.
Well, yes.

28:03.360 --> 28:07.040
I mean, an evening like tonight,
it's fine you letting us down,

28:07.240 --> 28:09.800
but how did you cope
when that was your kids,

28:10.000 --> 28:12.160
turning up two hours late
for supper?

28:12.200 --> 28:14.720
Oh, we, erm... muddled through.

28:17.120 --> 28:19.360
Anyway, Dad tells me
you're off to Venice at the weekend.

28:19.560 --> 28:23.320
I know. You should tell him
to stop spoiling me. I should.

28:24.400 --> 28:25.840
And first class, too.

28:26.960 --> 28:28.320
Venice?

28:37.840 --> 28:39.600
Right. Yeah.

28:41.400 --> 28:43.320
Funny. Very funny.

28:50.480 --> 28:52.640
Actually that's not quite
what I said.

28:52.680 --> 28:54.560
OK.

28:54.760 --> 28:57.400
I have it here, you said you
saw her leave just after midnight.

28:57.560 --> 28:59.040
No, I said she would have left

28:59.240 --> 29:00.800
just after her shift ended
at midnight.

29:00.960 --> 29:02.880
I never said I actually saw her.

29:03.040 --> 29:04.240
Right.

29:04.440 --> 29:06.920
Guy Halford, the manager,
he's the one who actually saw her.

29:08.280 --> 29:11.160
Sorry. And so what was the last time
you saw her?

29:11.320 --> 29:13.240
Just before 11.

29:13.400 --> 29:15.840
I was working through till three

29:16.000 --> 29:17.520
and I took a half-hour break then.

29:17.720 --> 29:19.320
When Guy came back,
he put me in the bar

29:19.520 --> 29:22.680
and I just presumed that Hayley
was finishing up in the restaurant.

29:22.880 --> 29:26.640
And Guy Halford,
does he still live in Middenham?

29:49.800 --> 29:51.400
Hi.
Hi.

29:52.560 --> 29:55.840
I'm looking for Christopher Lowe.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.080
Hello.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.320
Go on...

30:10.600 --> 30:11.800
Stay there. Stay.

30:24.400 --> 30:26.160
Mr Carr?
Yeah.

30:29.040 --> 30:31.760
DI Sunny Khan.
Have you got five minutes?

30:41.200 --> 30:42.560
No, I'm...

30:42.720 --> 30:43.840
Sorry.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.160
OK.

30:47.760 --> 30:49.440
Absolutely sure?

30:49.640 --> 30:52.880
Yeah.
You know who she is, though?

30:53.040 --> 30:54.880
Yeah. Of course, yeah.

30:55.080 --> 30:57.840
I mean, I never saw her
in that house.

30:59.360 --> 31:01.600
Are you OK, Mr Lowe?
Yeah.

31:01.760 --> 31:03.320
Yeah, I just...

31:04.400 --> 31:05.800
I don't cope with stress very well.

31:05.960 --> 31:08.280
Would you prefer to have someone
with you? No. No.

31:08.480 --> 31:11.120
No, I'm fine for now.
OK.

31:11.320 --> 31:13.520
So we're just asking everyone
we speak to

31:13.720 --> 31:16.680
a number of general questions
to help us with our enquiries.

31:16.880 --> 31:21.160
So, can you tell me
what car you were driving that week?

31:21.360 --> 31:23.120
I didn't take a car.
I went down with Tim.

31:24.520 --> 31:28.240
And then, did you and your family
travel back with him or...?

31:28.440 --> 31:30.760
My wife drove down
with our daughter

31:30.920 --> 31:32.400
and we went back in her car.

31:32.560 --> 31:33.800
Right.

31:33.960 --> 31:35.520
So what car was she driving?

31:36.640 --> 31:39.327
She would have been driving
the Maserati.

31:43.880 --> 31:45.200
Right.

32:01.700 --> 32:04.980
You know what?
I think I did see her at the house.

32:07.352 --> 32:09.792
Right. Are you sure?

32:09.843 --> 32:12.043
Yeah. Just one time, but, er...

32:12.540 --> 32:14.700
..she's got a distinctive face,
I guess.

32:14.740 --> 32:16.770
I think that was her.
OK.

32:17.382 --> 32:18.862
Was that on your own or...?

32:18.897 --> 32:21.418
Erm, I'd come back
from a round early.

32:21.470 --> 32:24.426
I was still a bit jet-lagged, so
I went back to the house for a kip.

32:24.500 --> 32:27.620
Er, when I walked in,
she was there, hoovering.

32:27.820 --> 32:31.171
I said hello and asked if there
was anything else she could do,

32:31.218 --> 32:32.618
cos of the noise.

32:32.794 --> 32:34.273
What day would this have been?

32:34.298 --> 32:35.350
Oh...

32:35.585 --> 32:38.952
I'd have to check a calendar.
Do you know when it was rented from?

32:38.980 --> 32:40.070
Yeah.

32:40.095 --> 32:41.095
Er...

32:42.580 --> 32:43.980
..Monday the 27th.

32:44.180 --> 32:47.940
Monday. Well, we arrived
in the evening, I remember that.

32:48.140 --> 32:50.100
I think we just chilled
the next day,

32:50.300 --> 32:52.100
had a couple of bevvies
in the local

32:52.300 --> 32:54.060
and played our first round
the day after.

32:54.220 --> 32:56.860
So I'm thinking the Wednesday.

32:58.300 --> 33:01.300
Just to go back to the conversation
with her,

33:01.500 --> 33:03.900
was it just about the hoovering,
was it? Yeah.

33:04.100 --> 33:07.140
When I woke up, the other lads
were back and she'd gone.

33:07.340 --> 33:09.820
And you didn't discuss this
with any of the others?

33:11.300 --> 33:12.940
Discuss what?

33:14.340 --> 33:16.260
That this girl...

33:17.700 --> 33:20.260
..who later went missing, had been
in the house you all rented.

33:20.420 --> 33:22.020
No.

33:22.220 --> 33:25.060
I mean, I drove back to London
on the 2nd

33:25.260 --> 33:28.100
and then flew out to Hong Kong
first thing the next day, so...

33:29.500 --> 33:31.260
This was a big story?

33:32.620 --> 33:35.980
It was huge. It was in all
the national newspapers for weeks.

33:36.180 --> 33:38.660
Right, well, I had no idea
about that.

33:40.940 --> 33:44.340
And her photo being on the front
pages the last couple of days.

33:44.540 --> 33:47.740
Work's been pretty crazy. I haven't
had time to look at the papers.

33:48.980 --> 33:52.940
I'm sorry, but the first I've ever
heard of this girl is, er... now.

33:55.620 --> 33:58.460
I suppose one of us
would have cooked

33:58.660 --> 34:00.580
and then all of us,
with kids, I mean,

34:00.740 --> 34:02.340
would have eaten together.

34:02.500 --> 34:03.980
And that was a pleasant evening?

34:04.180 --> 34:06.100
Yeah.
Everyone had a nice time?

34:06.143 --> 34:08.036
Yeah, we had a nice time.
Why do you ask that?

34:08.060 --> 34:09.580
Well, just...

34:09.630 --> 34:14.431
Because Christmas and New Year
can be quite stressful, can't it?

34:14.780 --> 34:17.340
And I understand your marriage
broke down not long after.

34:17.375 --> 34:18.898
What has that got to do
with anything?

34:18.922 --> 34:20.656
Well, I wondered
if that was in any way

34:20.735 --> 34:23.574
connected to something
that happened on this break.

34:23.946 --> 34:26.706
You know, I think I do,
I do need someone with me.

34:26.742 --> 34:29.054
Mm. And I can arrange that.
Of course.

34:29.079 --> 34:30.922
But can you answer that question,
please?

34:30.947 --> 34:34.648
Because I'm aware that, of
the three of you that were married,

34:35.031 --> 34:38.054
all of you were separated
within the year.

34:38.139 --> 34:41.020
No, that was, that was,
that was nothing to do with anything

34:41.047 --> 34:42.551
that happened on that break.

34:42.576 --> 34:43.656
So...

34:45.072 --> 34:46.192
Sure.

34:47.657 --> 34:48.918
Who's that?

34:50.521 --> 34:54.980
That's my girlfriend and her son.
I want to stop now, please.

34:55.570 --> 34:57.130
One more thing.

35:00.820 --> 35:03.100
Lastly, we're asking everyone
that we speak to

35:03.300 --> 35:06.180
how they'd feel about
providing a DNA swab.

35:06.987 --> 35:08.987
Entirely voluntary of course.

35:09.529 --> 35:10.929
How would you feel about that?

35:11.815 --> 35:13.255
Not a problem.

35:13.391 --> 35:14.911
Good. It won't take a minute.

35:22.637 --> 35:24.780
Mr Mullery, DC Jake Collier.

35:24.808 --> 35:26.836
Have you got five minutes
for a quick chat, sir?

35:26.860 --> 35:28.180
Now, you'll have my home address,

35:28.300 --> 35:30.460
but you decided to come here
because you thought what?

35:30.500 --> 35:31.980
That I'd be embarrassed

35:32.180 --> 35:34.540
and gratefully duck into some
car so no-one saw?

35:34.740 --> 35:36.900
I just want to ask
a few quick questions, sir.

35:36.940 --> 35:38.940
So a couple of hours ago,
the head suggested

35:39.100 --> 35:40.540
that maybe I should take some leave.

35:40.620 --> 35:43.100
Some of the parents have been
uncomfortable with the situation.

35:43.260 --> 35:45.700
And, of course, I could refuse
because she has no legal right.

35:45.740 --> 35:48.180
But do you know what?
I have spent the past 18 years

35:48.380 --> 35:50.740
telling people
that I wasn't even charged,

35:50.940 --> 35:52.500
that not one single piece
of evidence

35:52.700 --> 35:54.420
could ever be found
to incriminate me,

35:54.580 --> 35:56.500
that the lead detective retired

35:56.700 --> 35:59.020
just before a misconduct case
could be brought against him.

35:59.100 --> 36:01.340
So I am knackered

36:01.540 --> 36:04.740
and I'll take the paid break,
thank you very much.

36:04.900 --> 36:06.140
But what it also means

36:06.340 --> 36:08.500
is that I am not remotely
fucking embarrassed, mate.

36:09.580 --> 36:12.140
I'm not remotely embarrassed
to stand here

36:12.340 --> 36:15.780
and tell you loudly,
no, I will not talk to you.

36:15.940 --> 36:17.420
I will not sit in a car or a room

36:17.620 --> 36:19.820
or anywhere with you,
voluntarily, ever.

36:20.020 --> 36:22.820
And if you want to arrest me,
be my guest.

36:23.020 --> 36:25.620
But I'll not say
another fucking word to you.

36:25.780 --> 36:27.300
Not even, "No comment."

36:27.460 --> 36:29.580
Because I think the police are scum.

36:29.620 --> 36:32.300
I think you lie.
I think you break the law.

36:32.500 --> 36:34.260
I think you take bribes
and you sell stories.

36:34.340 --> 36:38.220
But worse than that,
most unforgiveable of all,

36:38.380 --> 36:40.660
I think you're thick.

36:40.860 --> 36:43.540
I think your ranks are made up
of dim-witted mediocrity

36:43.740 --> 36:45.620
who joined the force
because they want power

36:45.820 --> 36:48.100
but they're too stupid
to get employed anywhere else.

36:49.460 --> 36:52.220
So... shame on you...

36:53.700 --> 36:55.260
..for the way you treated me...

36:57.620 --> 37:00.660
..for letting Hayley down
so... catastrophically.

37:02.300 --> 37:05.460
And shame on you, DC Jake Collier...

37:07.060 --> 37:08.980
for becoming a police officer.

37:20.580 --> 37:22.260
And how sure did he seem?

37:22.460 --> 37:24.460
Pretty sure.
It was an instinctive reaction.

37:24.660 --> 37:26.900
I don't think he was recognising her
from the newspapers.

37:27.020 --> 37:29.180
So this definitively places her
in the house,

37:29.220 --> 37:32.140
possibly with all four men, before
the wives and kids arrived? Yeah.

37:32.300 --> 37:34.420
What was he like otherwise?

37:35.540 --> 37:36.660
Odd.

37:36.820 --> 37:37.980
An odd mixture.

37:39.060 --> 37:41.780
I mean, I guess you've got to ask,
why would he be telling me

37:41.980 --> 37:44.276
that he saw Hayley in the house
if he had something to hide?

37:44.300 --> 37:45.620
But...

37:45.820 --> 37:49.020
But when I asked him
if he'd give a DNA swab,

37:49.220 --> 37:51.820
he slightly looked like
he'd just shat himself.

37:54.420 --> 37:56.300
What's his background?

37:56.460 --> 37:57.900
Er...

37:59.460 --> 38:02.340
Lived and worked in Hong Kong
for 25 years.

38:02.540 --> 38:05.940
Only married for the first time
six years ago.

38:07.220 --> 38:09.620
No previous convictions,
at least not here.

38:09.780 --> 38:10.940
Ah...

38:11.140 --> 38:13.060
Drove down to Middenham
on a motorbike.

38:13.260 --> 38:16.940
Do we have a response
from James Hollis about his car yet?

38:17.140 --> 38:19.620
I'll chase that.
Er, how was your man?

38:21.180 --> 38:22.460
So, erm...

38:23.540 --> 38:25.260
He lives in a camper van.

38:25.420 --> 38:26.540
Oh.

38:26.740 --> 38:30.940
I'd say he's definitely had
some mental health issues,

38:30.980 --> 38:33.140
looks like he hasn't got
a pot to piss in.

38:33.180 --> 38:35.460
Except, in 1999,

38:35.620 --> 38:38.900
he was CEO of DDM Lowe,

38:39.060 --> 38:42.860
his own advertising agency.

38:43.060 --> 38:45.940
And this is a guy who got
a double first from Cambridge,

38:46.140 --> 38:49.300
was basically a bit of a genius
through his life,

38:49.500 --> 38:52.580
lived in a five million quid house
in Notting Hill.

38:53.660 --> 38:55.300
Wow. When did he leave?

38:55.460 --> 38:56.740
Early 2000.

38:57.820 --> 39:00.060
"To pursue new challenges."

39:00.260 --> 39:01.740
What, like,
how to live in a car park?

39:05.620 --> 39:07.060
DCI Stuart.

39:07.220 --> 39:10.020
Hello, I'm just returning your call.

39:10.220 --> 39:13.140
It's Mel Hollis here.
I'm James Hollis' ex-wife.

39:13.340 --> 39:15.740
Ah, Mrs Hollis.
Yeah, thanks for returning my call.

39:18.780 --> 39:20.380
No, it wasn't a pleasant evening.

39:20.580 --> 39:22.740
What it was
was a train wreck.

39:22.780 --> 39:24.180
In what way?

39:25.540 --> 39:28.260
Look the meal was fine,
we ate, we cleared up,

39:28.460 --> 39:30.860
the kids were knackered,
it'd been a long day getting there,

39:31.020 --> 39:32.700
so they went to bed about 9:30.

39:32.900 --> 39:35.740
Which was good.
That they were in bed, I mean,

39:35.940 --> 39:40.660
because they didn't have to see
Chris go completely nuts,

39:40.860 --> 39:43.020
for want of a better word.
How do you mean?

39:43.060 --> 39:45.260
Out of the blue,
he just started ranting

39:45.460 --> 39:48.700
about his life,
his marriage, his friends...

39:50.020 --> 39:53.660
..how it all meant nothing,
how everything was an illusion.

39:53.860 --> 39:56.660
It was quiet terrifying.
Wow, yeah, I can imagine.

39:56.820 --> 39:59.300
And, so... what did people do?

39:59.500 --> 40:02.860
Well, I mean, we all tried
to calm him down, obviously,

40:03.020 --> 40:05.180
particularly Laura his wife.

40:05.380 --> 40:08.340
But he was flailing his arms
and shouting and...

40:09.620 --> 40:12.340
To be honest,
we were all quite relieved

40:12.540 --> 40:14.540
when he then just suddenly
walked out.

40:14.740 --> 40:16.100
Of the house?
Mm-hm.

40:16.300 --> 40:19.100
And went where?
I don't know.

40:20.980 --> 40:22.300
Had he been drinking?

40:22.460 --> 40:23.900
Well, he'd had a few.

40:24.100 --> 40:26.100
We'd all had a few.
It was New Year's Eve.

40:27.260 --> 40:28.420
Anything else?

40:30.300 --> 40:32.300
Someone might have bought some coke.

40:32.500 --> 40:34.220
I don't know,
maybe he'd had a bit of that.

40:36.580 --> 40:37.860
OK.

40:38.020 --> 40:39.300
So who was taking coke?

40:40.780 --> 40:42.940
Not me.
Not any of the women, actually.

40:42.980 --> 40:44.460
Tim Finch?

40:44.660 --> 40:47.060
Definitely not, no.
He never did that.

40:47.220 --> 40:50.460
Pete, no, he was more of a drinker.

40:50.620 --> 40:52.420
James... yes.

40:52.620 --> 40:55.980
In fact, I think it was him
that probably bought it.

40:56.140 --> 40:59.500
When Chris went out of the house,

40:59.700 --> 41:02.420
what time would that have been?
I don't know.

41:02.620 --> 41:05.660
Just after ten, I guess.
And did anyone go after him?

41:05.820 --> 41:08.180
Yeah, after a minute or two...

41:08.340 --> 41:10.740
..er, James and Tim.

41:10.940 --> 41:13.100
Did they catch up with him?
No.

41:13.140 --> 41:15.860
No, Chris came back on his own
about an hour and a half later.

41:16.020 --> 41:17.500
He was absolutely drenched.

41:17.700 --> 41:19.460
I mean, it was raining hard
at this point

41:19.660 --> 41:21.820
and his clothes
were covered with mud

41:21.860 --> 41:24.220
and he went straight upstairs
to bed.

41:24.420 --> 41:26.980
No explanation, no apology, nothing.
Right.

41:27.140 --> 41:28.500
Where was Pete Carr at this point?

41:28.700 --> 41:30.860
Pete had been out
since right after the meal,

41:31.060 --> 41:33.540
trying his luck at the pub.
Trying his luck?

41:33.700 --> 41:35.060
The ladies.

41:36.460 --> 41:38.100
He got back just after midnight.

41:38.300 --> 41:40.460
On his own?
Mm-hm.

41:40.500 --> 41:41.980
And pissed.

41:42.180 --> 41:44.940
And your husband and Dr Finch?
The same.

41:45.140 --> 41:47.900
No, they got back
just before midnight.

41:48.100 --> 41:50.100
Just in time for Auld Lang Syne,
bless.

41:50.260 --> 41:52.260
Were they separate or together?

41:54.420 --> 41:55.740
I can't remember.

41:57.420 --> 41:59.380
And what happened then?

41:59.580 --> 42:01.980
The guys went to bed,
the women stayed up

42:02.180 --> 42:04.340
and talked about
our car crash marriages.

42:04.380 --> 42:05.380
OK.

42:06.900 --> 42:09.580
This is really important, Ms Hollis,
so...

42:10.860 --> 42:12.860
..I want you to think
very carefully, please.

42:13.980 --> 42:18.620
Did you see anyone go out again
after that?

42:18.780 --> 42:19.820
No.

42:20.900 --> 42:22.420
No-one went out again after that.

42:27.060 --> 42:28.460
You sound very certain.

42:29.700 --> 42:32.500
Firstly, I sat up talking
to Laura and Derran

42:32.700 --> 42:35.700
till about three o'clock
in the morning, and then...

42:35.900 --> 42:38.780
I wasn't going to sleep with James
that night, so I slept on the sofa.

42:38.980 --> 42:41.580
Except, I didn't, really.
Sleep, I mean.

42:41.780 --> 42:44.020
So that meant I would have seen
if anyone had gone out.

42:44.180 --> 42:45.540
And they didn't.

42:48.780 --> 42:50.100
Right.

42:51.980 --> 42:53.220
Fuck.

42:53.420 --> 42:56.060
The last sighting of her was after
they were all back in the house.

42:58.500 --> 43:00.460
So she could be lying.
Yep.

43:00.660 --> 43:03.300
Or mistaken. Maybe she did sleep
and one of them came down

43:03.500 --> 43:05.300
at four or five or whatever
and then went out.

43:05.460 --> 43:08.340
Except, if one of them came down
at four or five,

43:08.540 --> 43:11.380
went out then and killed her,
where...

43:11.580 --> 43:14.420
..where was Hayley between leaving
the pub at 12:10 and four or five?

43:16.220 --> 43:18.380
No, that feels wrong.
Yeah, maybe.

43:18.420 --> 43:19.780
But not as wrong as all four men

43:19.980 --> 43:22.140
having clearly lied to us
through their teeth.

43:22.180 --> 43:23.620
There is that.

43:25.380 --> 43:26.780
I need a drink.

43:26.940 --> 43:28.620
There is that.

43:43.380 --> 43:45.860
Yeah, it was about ten past,

43:46.020 --> 43:47.820
maybe quarter past midnight.

43:48.020 --> 43:50.980
Enough time to change, anyway.
For the party? Yeah.

43:51.140 --> 43:52.980
Cos she went as Madonna,

43:53.140 --> 43:55.260
the Desperately Seeking Susan one.

43:55.460 --> 43:57.620
You know, all the slap and the hair
and everything.

43:57.780 --> 44:00.340
It was an '80s theme, I think.

44:02.820 --> 44:04.380
Sorry, just a sec.
Sure.

44:12.060 --> 44:14.420
This is from Hayley's diary.

44:14.620 --> 44:18.820
"I hate the '80s, I hate
fancy dress, so am going as ME!!

44:18.860 --> 44:21.380
"They should be so lucky.
Lucky, lucky, lucky!!"

44:21.540 --> 44:22.620
Maybe she changed her mind.

44:24.380 --> 44:27.540
Were there any other female staff
going to the party

44:27.740 --> 44:30.100
who would have been the same age,
same build as Hayley?

44:37.540 --> 44:38.900
Hey...

44:41.060 --> 44:42.580
Hey, Fran, what's up?

44:42.780 --> 44:45.220
There was another employee,
same build, same colouring,

44:45.380 --> 44:46.660
same hair as Hayley,

44:46.860 --> 44:49.180
who's just confirmed to me
that she went as Madonna

44:49.340 --> 44:51.020
and she left around 12:10.

44:51.220 --> 44:53.740
So you think the manager
saw her leaving, not Hayley?

44:53.940 --> 44:56.100
I think it has to be
a very strong possibility.

44:56.140 --> 44:59.020
Which means the last confirmed
sighting of Hayley was way earlier.

44:59.220 --> 45:02.380
At 11, after which she could
easily have bunked off work early.

45:02.540 --> 45:04.460
OK, this is brilliant work, Fran.

45:04.542 --> 45:06.291
Let's talk first thing tomorrow.

45:06.316 --> 45:08.082
Goodnight, boss.
You heard that?

45:08.121 --> 45:10.001
So she could actually
have left the pub earlier.

45:10.026 --> 45:11.306
At 11.

45:11.459 --> 45:14.794
Which means we now have four men,
variously pissed,

45:14.836 --> 45:17.116
drugged up
and possibly mentally unstable,

45:17.159 --> 45:18.919
out somewhere in Middenham,

45:19.540 --> 45:21.633
at exactly the same time as Hayley.
