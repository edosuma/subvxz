WEBVTT

01:08.831 --> 01:12.413
Raylan? Raylan?

01:13.252 --> 01:15.790
- Are you hearing me?
- Yeah. I hear you.

01:15.921 --> 01:18.329
Okay, yeah. I was saying
that Helen got at least one shot off

01:18.465 --> 01:21.668
in the exchange
and we found traces of blood spatter

01:21.802 --> 01:23.759
on the wall across from her body.

01:23.887 --> 01:24.883
Good for her.

01:25.597 --> 01:29.049
Well, we're searching all the hospitals
and clinics in a 100-mile radius

01:29.184 --> 01:31.011
for gunshot victims, but nothing yet.

01:31.186 --> 01:33.856
Yeah. Where's Arlo?

01:34.648 --> 01:36.023
He's upstairs.

01:36.191 --> 01:40.059
He said something about picking
out a dress for the service.

01:42.990 --> 01:46.156
So, we can't just assume
that this was the Bennetts.

01:46.285 --> 01:48.776
There's plenty of people knew
about that Black Pike money.

01:48.954 --> 01:50.697
Was her money taken?

01:50.956 --> 01:52.699
And that notwithstanding,
I don't have to tell you

01:52.833 --> 01:55.240
that your father has his
fair share of enemies.

01:55.377 --> 01:57.334
Well, then why did you?

01:58.255 --> 01:59.666
'Cause you don't look convinced.

02:00.340 --> 02:02.250
You're worried
I'm gonna do something rash?

02:03.176 --> 02:05.964
No. 'Cause you're down here
on your personal time, right?

02:07.139 --> 02:09.381
Art called, says you're down here
as a private citizen.

02:09.640 --> 02:11.681
There you go. Nothing to worry about.

03:27.678 --> 03:30.678
- You know what that smell is?
- Bacon?

03:30.806 --> 03:32.348
That is cinnamon.

03:32.724 --> 03:35.559
They cure this bacon with cinnamon.

03:36.353 --> 03:37.468
That shit ain't right. Cinnamon?

03:37.604 --> 03:39.348
Wait till you taste it.

03:39.564 --> 03:42.565
- All quiet on the western front?
- Yep.

03:43.360 --> 03:46.563
- What day your boys getting here?
- Tomorrow. They got delayed.

03:46.697 --> 03:47.811
Time is of the essence, Devil.

03:47.948 --> 03:51.068
We don't get those boys down here quick
to help stand guard, we are gonna drop.

03:51.201 --> 03:55.246
Well, they're getting some Emulex,
maybe some grenades, too.

03:55.956 --> 03:59.159
In case the Bennetts come with
numbers, we even up the playing field.

03:59.293 --> 04:01.618
Well, that's worth waiting for.

04:02.129 --> 04:04.536
Here come them eggs.

04:04.673 --> 04:07.923
Hey, baby? Ava?

04:13.265 --> 04:14.296
What is it?

04:18.312 --> 04:19.426
What happened?

04:26.820 --> 04:28.279
Helen's dead.

04:29.239 --> 04:31.481
They shot her last night in her house.

04:33.952 --> 04:35.826
Devil, I'm gonna need you
to call your friends.

04:35.996 --> 04:38.487
You tell them to get here tonight.

04:45.088 --> 04:47.377
- I thought you were getting a dress.
- It's over there.

04:47.632 --> 04:49.542
That was her favourite.

04:52.512 --> 04:54.007
Who are you loading
those bullets up for?

04:54.389 --> 04:56.049
You know damn well who.

04:56.183 --> 04:58.056
The Bennetts?
You think it was the Bennetts?

04:58.185 --> 04:59.679
You killed Coover.

04:59.853 --> 05:03.554
Now your aunt is dead. You suppose
that's a coincidence, lawman?

05:03.690 --> 05:05.101
No, I don't.

05:05.358 --> 05:08.893
So, you're gonna charge off,
guns blazing, and kill 'em all? That it?

05:09.029 --> 05:10.938
- Not all.
- Which ones?

05:11.114 --> 05:13.901
Mags didn't come in
here with no shotgun.

05:14.034 --> 05:16.904
And Doyle wouldn't
do this kind of thing.

05:17.037 --> 05:19.789
So it's just Dickie you're after, then.

05:21.500 --> 05:23.042
Where were you?

05:25.003 --> 05:26.545
Where were you?

05:26.671 --> 05:29.459
I find it odd that she got killed at 2:00
in the morning. Where were you?

05:29.758 --> 05:30.837
Hell is that supposed to mean?

05:30.967 --> 05:32.165
I'm just wondering where you were.

05:32.302 --> 05:36.347
Helen ain't dead because I wasn't here.
She's dead because you killed one of theirs.

05:36.473 --> 05:39.427
- Stop loading your gun.
- If you cared at all about her,

05:39.559 --> 05:41.137
you'd be loading up your guns, too.

05:41.394 --> 05:43.054
My guns are always loaded.

05:43.605 --> 05:45.016
All she did for you...

05:45.148 --> 05:46.808
I know exactly what she did for me!

05:46.942 --> 05:49.100
I certainly don't need to
be reminded of it by you!

05:51.321 --> 05:53.610
I hope we're not interrupting.

05:54.157 --> 05:55.236
What the hell you doing here?

05:55.492 --> 05:57.235
You can come on in.

05:59.079 --> 06:01.831
We heard what happened.
We want to offer our condolences.

06:02.999 --> 06:05.407
Okay, well, now you've done it.
You can be on your way.

06:05.544 --> 06:06.824
What kind of way is that to act?

06:06.962 --> 06:08.372
I know you're hurting, Raylan.

06:08.713 --> 06:09.793
Don't preach to me.

06:10.423 --> 06:12.500
Believe it or not, we
come with pure intent.

06:19.766 --> 06:21.426
- Raylan...
- Don't.

06:31.862 --> 06:34.697
Mind leaving one of your cruisers here
to keep an eye on Arlo?

06:34.823 --> 06:37.528
I can arrange that. Where you headed?

06:37.659 --> 06:39.118
Funeral home.

06:40.704 --> 06:43.788
- I'll let you know if we find anything.
- Okay.

06:46.459 --> 06:48.002
I'm awful sorry, Arlo.

06:49.337 --> 06:50.962
Are you okay?

06:51.840 --> 06:53.963
I told you, Dickie made me.

06:54.259 --> 06:56.298
Raylan have any idea?

06:56.428 --> 06:58.919
No. And he ain't gonna.

07:00.223 --> 07:01.801
When Raylan finds Dickie,

07:01.933 --> 07:05.053
that doglegged son of a bitch
is gonna be dead.

07:07.772 --> 07:09.730
God! Christ, Dickie!

07:11.610 --> 07:13.483
How the hell am I gonna explain this
to Genny?

07:13.653 --> 07:16.061
Just say we were out hunting
and I accidentally shot you.

07:16.198 --> 07:18.605
- She ain't gonna believe that shit.
- Sure she will.

07:19.326 --> 07:20.440
She already doesn't like you.

07:20.577 --> 07:22.783
I'm supposed to tell her you shot me?

07:22.913 --> 07:27.041
Shot by... "By accident"
is the key word there, Jed, by accident.

07:28.335 --> 07:32.332
Hey, hey. Where you gonna hide
your share of the stash, huh?

07:32.464 --> 07:35.334
I keep mine in a little
box inside the wall.

07:35.467 --> 07:39.334
I got an old fishing kit.
I keep it at the bottom. Why?

07:39.471 --> 07:42.721
Well, Genny and your little girl ain't
gonna go nosing around and find it?

07:42.891 --> 07:45.097
- Haven't yet.
- Hang on.

07:46.770 --> 07:49.687
- Last one?
- That about does it, yeah. Yeah.

07:50.899 --> 07:51.978
Okay.

07:52.108 --> 07:55.228
Dickie, what if they connect
this back to us, the cops?

07:55.403 --> 07:58.404
Hey, hey.
That ain't gonna happen, man.

07:58.573 --> 08:00.613
I cleaned up all the blood.
You saw me clean up the blood.

08:00.742 --> 08:03.447
And there ain't no way they're gonna
match up a shotgun pellet. Okay?

08:03.870 --> 08:06.242
- Because I can't do no time.
- I know. I know.

08:06.373 --> 08:09.077
Hey. It'll be okay. All right?

08:09.960 --> 08:11.703
Let's clean this shit up
before your family gets home,

08:11.836 --> 08:14.541
and I'll give you a holler, all right?

08:17.008 --> 08:19.001
So sorry, Raylan. Truly.

08:21.429 --> 08:24.347
Your aunt and I had a lot of history.

08:24.474 --> 08:28.424
Truth be told,
I always saw a bit of myself in her,

08:28.561 --> 08:30.803
and I'd like to think
she'd say the same thing.

08:30.939 --> 08:32.847
Mags, I want to stop you right there.

08:32.982 --> 08:36.601
While I appreciate all that,
I ain't here for sentiment.

08:37.279 --> 08:39.318
I guess you'd better tell me
what it is you do want.

08:39.780 --> 08:42.984
I want to see your boys.
Well, just the one boy, really.

08:43.326 --> 08:44.357
Leave him out of this.

08:44.494 --> 08:45.905
I think he's responsible.

08:46.037 --> 08:49.905
I think Helen and Arlo made my deal
with Black Pike possible.

08:50.041 --> 08:52.746
And as you can see,
that deal angered a lot of folks,

08:52.877 --> 08:55.285
folks who knew your kin was paid cash
for that property.

08:56.256 --> 09:00.088
- That's the line you want to take?
- Yeah, well, robberies go wrong all the time.

09:00.218 --> 09:02.045
Mags, where's Dickie?

09:05.473 --> 09:07.964
Why, so you can finish the job
you started 20 years ago?

09:08.476 --> 09:10.552
Crippling him wasn't enough.
Now you want to kill him?

09:10.729 --> 09:13.683
- I just want to talk to him.
- Yeah. Yeah. Of course.

09:13.815 --> 09:15.440
Fine. Don't help me.

09:15.859 --> 09:19.228
But if Arlo finds him first,
we both know how that'll end.

09:21.990 --> 09:25.738
I had every intention of
living a simple life,

09:25.869 --> 09:28.739
raising my boys, keeping house.

09:34.377 --> 09:36.002
Then Pervis got killed,

09:38.131 --> 09:40.171
and I accepted this role,

09:40.925 --> 09:43.214
did what I had to do for my family.

09:43.345 --> 09:45.005
I may not have lived the life I wanted,

09:45.138 --> 09:49.515
but I'll be damned if my grandchildren
are gonna live it the same way.

09:49.934 --> 09:53.019
I got Doyle's boys a
path out of this holler.

09:54.606 --> 09:56.848
And nothing is more important to me
than that.

09:57.734 --> 10:00.937
So, where is he?

10:02.364 --> 10:03.692
I don't know.

10:05.575 --> 10:09.703
After he helped you find Coover,
I separated myself from him.

10:10.830 --> 10:13.748
I heard he's been staying
some at Coover's.

10:14.334 --> 10:18.628
Out of guilt or sadness, I do not know.

10:24.552 --> 10:25.928
Thought you were making
funeral arrangements.

10:26.054 --> 10:27.797
I was. Needed a razor.

10:27.931 --> 10:29.389
Yeah. Where is it?

10:29.557 --> 10:31.716
Didn't have my brand.

10:31.851 --> 10:34.093
Your father got away from us.

10:36.523 --> 10:38.314
Used Boyd to give my man the slip.

10:38.900 --> 10:41.854
Got any idea where
they might be headed?

10:41.986 --> 10:43.362
Nope.

10:50.995 --> 10:54.246
Doyle, we got a problem.

11:18.523 --> 11:19.721
What the hell do you want?

11:19.858 --> 11:21.601
I want you to put that gun down.

11:21.734 --> 11:23.394
Get the hell out of here.

11:23.528 --> 11:26.612
Arlo, you remember the last time
you pointed a gun at me?

11:30.368 --> 11:31.399
Put it down.

11:41.546 --> 11:42.874
She hated me.

11:44.048 --> 11:45.211
Helen.

11:47.594 --> 11:48.589
Yeah, well...

11:48.720 --> 11:53.263
I wasn't good enough for Frances.
I was a lousy father.

11:53.766 --> 11:56.174
Yeah, sounds about right.

11:56.311 --> 12:00.807
When your mother died,
you wouldn't know, never coming by,

12:00.940 --> 12:04.144
but I was hopeless,
and Helen stepped in.

12:04.319 --> 12:09.693
But she didn't stop with her sharp
tongue, not for one damn instant.

12:09.824 --> 12:12.529
Always snapping, needling.

12:12.660 --> 12:14.783
One day I just barked back.

12:14.913 --> 12:18.531
Can't remember what I said. Something
about her being a harpy, I think.

12:18.666 --> 12:21.157
She laughed. That was it.

12:21.294 --> 12:26.122
Not a day went by we weren't
tearing strips off each other.

12:26.299 --> 12:27.959
But that was our dance.

12:28.092 --> 12:34.510
No disrespect to your mother, but
the last 15 years, the best of my life.

12:35.266 --> 12:37.010
Why did you think
you could find Dickie here?

12:37.977 --> 12:40.219
That's all you've got to say?

12:41.147 --> 12:42.428
What do you want me to say?

12:42.565 --> 12:45.685
You haven't offered any
condolences or, shit,

12:45.818 --> 12:48.523
even said you're sad she's dead.

12:48.655 --> 12:49.983
You want me to share my feelings?

12:50.114 --> 12:52.072
- Oh, for God's sake...
- I'm sorry, Arlo.

12:52.200 --> 12:56.743
I just don't see how me exploring my
grief is gonna help me find Dickie.

12:58.623 --> 13:00.699
So my question is,
why'd you come here?

13:00.833 --> 13:02.660
I heard tell he might be here.

13:02.794 --> 13:04.668
Mags told me the same thing.

13:05.672 --> 13:07.000
Where would you look next?

13:07.131 --> 13:08.626
Why would I tell you?

13:10.051 --> 13:11.676
I want to find him, same as you.

13:11.803 --> 13:14.969
Not the same as me.
You want to arrest him.

13:15.890 --> 13:17.550
Okay, then. Let's go.

13:17.809 --> 13:19.967
- What? Where?
- I'm gonna haul you off to jail.

13:20.436 --> 13:21.812
Drunk and disorderly.

13:21.938 --> 13:25.437
Heard you tell that statie you're
down here as a private citizen.

13:25.567 --> 13:27.524
I can still arrest people, you idiot.

13:29.571 --> 13:31.480
You're not gonna arrest me.

13:32.198 --> 13:35.484
- Take these things off of me!
- Nick, got a live one for you.

13:35.618 --> 13:37.445
All right! All right!

13:39.038 --> 13:43.083
I'll tell you what you need to know
if you let me out of here.

13:43.209 --> 13:44.240
I'm listening.

13:44.377 --> 13:48.422
Go to Audry's. Ask around.
Dickie's a regular over there.

13:51.092 --> 13:52.420
Thank you.

13:52.844 --> 13:56.260
Breaking and entering, concealing
a loaded weapon, D&D. Take your pick.

13:56.389 --> 13:57.385
What?

13:57.849 --> 13:58.963
Get some rest, Arlo.

13:59.267 --> 14:01.094
I told you what you need to know!

14:01.227 --> 14:02.971
You have my undying gratitude.

14:03.187 --> 14:04.598
You shithead!

14:08.902 --> 14:11.274
Okay. Who wants some hot chocolate?

14:12.155 --> 14:13.815
Blow on it, baby,
before you singe your tongue.

14:13.948 --> 14:15.063
Okay.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.455
Not exactly a 14-year-old's idea
of a good time, is it?

14:28.046 --> 14:29.326
I'm fine.

14:31.966 --> 14:33.377
What'd you do for fun back home?

14:34.427 --> 14:35.672
I worked.

14:36.012 --> 14:38.218
Right. What was your job?

14:39.933 --> 14:41.972
I sold weed to kids at school.

14:45.813 --> 14:47.687
Hey, Loretta.

14:47.815 --> 14:49.274
You want to come play?

14:49.525 --> 14:50.688
Just a second, honey.

14:54.197 --> 14:56.569
I know this isn't easy, Loretta.

14:57.784 --> 15:00.987
But we're all real glad
to have you here, honey.

15:03.331 --> 15:05.370
Guess that's what you're
supposed to say, isn't it?

15:07.293 --> 15:10.413
Yes. But that don't mean it ain't true.

15:38.616 --> 15:39.861
Ellen May.

15:39.992 --> 15:42.318
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:42.453 --> 15:45.656
- How you doing, baby?
- I'm good. Thank you.

15:48.543 --> 15:50.001
That's right.

15:52.338 --> 15:53.832
You don't remember me, do you?

15:54.090 --> 15:56.545
Of course I remember you, baby.

15:56.968 --> 15:59.423
I was... I was here not long ago.

16:00.388 --> 16:01.668
You were with one of the other girls

16:01.806 --> 16:05.424
and a little dude with a
swastika tattooed on his chest.

16:06.853 --> 16:08.561
That sounds kinky.

16:09.522 --> 16:12.274
Yeah, I bet it was,
until two fellas started shooting at us.

16:13.526 --> 16:14.901
Right out here.

16:15.027 --> 16:18.646
Till the chief of police came
and shot and killed them both.

16:18.781 --> 16:21.237
Right out there by that dumpster?

16:25.246 --> 16:28.911
What are... What are you doing here?

16:30.501 --> 16:35.875
I'm here 'cause I just came by

16:36.007 --> 16:38.046
for a little information.

16:39.761 --> 16:42.430
A client of yours named Dickie Bennett.

16:45.391 --> 16:51.145
You know, I woke up this morning,
and I thought I had problems.

16:51.272 --> 16:55.352
I couldn't pay my rent.
I have a sick dog.

16:55.485 --> 16:58.770
And I can't find a man to save my life.

16:58.905 --> 17:04.491
But you, you're gonna solve all my problems
'cause if I just tell you about Dickie Bennett,

17:04.618 --> 17:08.069
he's gonna come and
he's gonna kill me.

17:08.705 --> 17:11.280
- No. No, no, no, no, no.
- Yeah.

17:11.416 --> 17:12.994
That's not gonna happen. I promise.

17:14.212 --> 17:18.790
I'm not here on official capacity, not
gonna make a scene and haul you in.

17:19.342 --> 17:21.050
I'm just looking for Dickie.

17:21.719 --> 17:23.546
What do you want to talk to him about?

17:25.807 --> 17:27.182
Well, he killed my aunt.

17:28.601 --> 17:29.929
Seriously?

17:39.821 --> 17:42.146
Jed Berwind.

17:43.324 --> 17:46.159
Jed Berwind. I don't follow.

17:46.285 --> 17:50.579
He's Dickie's shadow.
You find Jed, and you'll find Dickie.

17:55.086 --> 17:56.414
Thank you.

17:58.214 --> 18:00.752
Wait. You head out now,

18:00.883 --> 18:03.505
and everyone's gonna think
you're a two-pump chump.

18:05.763 --> 18:09.097
Well, why don't you tell them for me

18:09.225 --> 18:12.808
that I was the best two pumps
of your life, okay?

18:12.937 --> 18:14.016
Yeah.

18:15.523 --> 18:16.851
All right.

18:37.962 --> 18:39.670
Tell me it wasn't you.

18:45.678 --> 18:47.635
Hey! Hey! Listen to me.

18:48.097 --> 18:49.425
Mama.

18:51.434 --> 18:52.762
I love you,

18:53.144 --> 18:54.971
and I always tried to
do what you wanted.

18:55.438 --> 18:58.143
But ever since Coover,
you just ain't been thinking right.

18:58.774 --> 19:00.767
I am still the head of this family!

19:01.193 --> 19:03.233
Yeah, and why is it, Mama,

19:03.362 --> 19:06.612
that the head of this family
gave away this family's territory

19:07.283 --> 19:09.322
to Boyd Crowder, no less?

19:10.369 --> 19:12.445
Boy, you don't know
what you're talking about.

19:12.788 --> 19:18.079
What I know is Boyd Crowder robbed us point
blank at the shed and Arlo helped him.

19:18.210 --> 19:19.705
What I know is Boyd ran off Rodney,

19:19.837 --> 19:22.079
told him he was swinging dick
around these parts.

19:22.215 --> 19:24.587
You, you gave Boyd an inch,

19:25.384 --> 19:27.176
he took a country mile.
That's what I know.

19:27.345 --> 19:30.049
If you had a problem, you should
have come to me, like always.

19:31.182 --> 19:33.221
Even after you disowned me?

19:34.894 --> 19:36.305
No, I don't think so.

19:36.854 --> 19:39.060
No, you know, you can just go off.

19:39.231 --> 19:41.354
Go make all your big
future plans, Mama.

19:41.484 --> 19:46.311
Go on. Get Doyle and his tads their
seat in Future Land, Tomorrow Land.

19:46.822 --> 19:51.401
I'll tell you what, I am living
in the here and now, in Harlan County,

19:52.328 --> 19:53.573
and I ain't about to sit by and watch

19:53.704 --> 19:56.160
while a Crowder takes
and takes and takes what's ours.

19:56.290 --> 19:57.950
You need to watch yourself, boy.

20:00.002 --> 20:01.081
It's my turn now.

20:01.212 --> 20:04.663
You want to be in charge?
Is that what this is about?

20:06.092 --> 20:09.342
I want what's coming to me.

20:10.930 --> 20:13.053
Okay, Mr. President.

20:14.141 --> 20:15.173
I want what's coming to me.

20:15.309 --> 20:17.349
Helen is dead.

20:17.478 --> 20:19.269
Everybody knows that you're to blame.

20:20.481 --> 20:22.308
Raylan's already been at the store.

20:22.441 --> 20:24.481
What are you gonna do
when he catches up to you?

20:24.610 --> 20:26.603
That ain't gonna happen.

20:28.322 --> 20:31.987
We're gonna throw Raylan off that scent,
give him a damn good reason to stand down.

20:32.118 --> 20:33.197
Yeah. How's that?

20:35.204 --> 20:38.122
Jed's gonna get himself killed
resisting arrest.

20:42.670 --> 20:43.666
God damn.

20:44.588 --> 20:46.877
You gonna ask that of me
after everything I done for you?

20:48.801 --> 20:50.675
I'm gonna tell you where he's
hiding his share of the money.

20:50.803 --> 20:52.214
You find that and his shotgun

20:52.346 --> 20:55.596
and you match his blood with the drops
I made sure to leave at the scene,

20:55.725 --> 20:57.005
there you have it.

21:00.146 --> 21:04.357
Dickie, I swear, your actions
jeopardise my plans in any way,

21:05.443 --> 21:07.649
I will let you swing for it.

21:14.869 --> 21:16.778
By which, I believe you mean,

21:16.912 --> 21:19.664
"That's a damn good plan you
got there, my darling son."

21:21.751 --> 21:24.870
You see the beauty in this,
don't you, brother?

21:25.796 --> 21:30.458
Do you? Everyone will know that we
hit back and won't be able to prove it,

21:30.593 --> 21:32.550
but they will know what that means.

21:41.604 --> 21:44.059
- Jed.
- Doyle. What's going on?

21:44.607 --> 21:46.231
Want to come on out
here and talk to me?

21:46.859 --> 21:49.148
Is that really necessary?

21:49.278 --> 21:53.490
Well, you can come out here and
talk to me, and it'll just be you,

21:53.616 --> 21:55.443
or I can come inside.

21:56.702 --> 21:59.027
You come by to apologise
on behalf of your brother?

21:59.705 --> 22:02.540
- Excuse me?
- For shooting my husband.

22:02.666 --> 22:04.291
He ought to be locked up.

22:04.668 --> 22:06.875
You need to take a walk, Genny.
This don't concern you.

22:07.505 --> 22:10.375
It does
when you're standing at my front door.

22:11.258 --> 22:13.334
I'm gonna ask you
to step back into the house.

22:14.011 --> 22:15.968
- You shitting me?
- Genny, go on back inside now.

22:16.097 --> 22:18.588
Every one of you Bennetts are crazy,
aren't you?

22:20.476 --> 22:23.263
- I ain't gonna ask you again, Genny.
- Do what he says.

22:23.396 --> 22:25.388
What are you gonna do?
You gonna shoot me? Is that it?

22:25.523 --> 22:28.061
Well, this looks like a lot of fun.

22:29.193 --> 22:32.977
Ma'am, Deputy US Marshal.

22:33.739 --> 22:37.737
I want you to go inside your home
and shut the door, right now.

22:40.454 --> 22:42.826
Not you, Jed. No, no, no.

22:51.841 --> 22:53.549
So, what's the plan?

22:53.759 --> 22:57.627
Kill Jed, pin Helen's murder on him,
Dickie gets off?

23:00.307 --> 23:01.339
You joking?

23:01.809 --> 23:04.300
I pat you down,
I ain't gonna find a throwdown?

23:04.812 --> 23:08.857
Well, you even try to pat me down,
I'll kill you.

23:10.818 --> 23:12.526
It was rhetorical.

23:15.364 --> 23:17.321
- Can I go on inside now?
- No, Jed, you cannot.

23:17.449 --> 23:20.154
You can stand right there. Keep
your hands where we can see them.

23:20.286 --> 23:22.777
Don't want to give Quick Draw McGraw
any provocation.

23:25.749 --> 23:26.912
Are we done here?

23:29.920 --> 23:30.952
Yeah.

23:31.964 --> 23:34.004
Ain't nothing can't wait.

23:42.057 --> 23:43.931
Now, we can go inside.

23:47.813 --> 23:51.597
Jed, I know you were there
with Dickie last night

23:51.734 --> 23:53.276
when Helen was murdered.

23:53.402 --> 23:56.818
And before you deny it,
they found blood at the crime scene.

23:56.947 --> 23:59.355
And I can see plain as day
you're favouring that arm.

23:59.491 --> 24:04.319
Now, if that blood matches yours, and
I'm gonna bet my left nut that it does,

24:05.372 --> 24:07.032
you're gonna go away
for the rest of your life.

24:07.625 --> 24:09.997
Unless you didn't pull the trigger.

24:10.127 --> 24:13.543
Then maybe, there's a way
you can watch your daughter grow up

24:13.672 --> 24:15.332
and keep sleeping with your wife.

24:17.927 --> 24:20.797
Doyle was gonna kill you.

24:20.930 --> 24:23.088
You know that, right?

24:23.224 --> 24:27.601
Talking to me is the only
way you get out of this alive.

24:30.522 --> 24:33.274
I need to know you can protect me
and my family.

24:34.652 --> 24:35.731
Was it Dickie?

24:42.952 --> 24:44.695
And you were there?

24:51.168 --> 24:54.122
Okay. We're gonna take you in,

24:54.255 --> 24:56.461
and you're gonna get this all down
on record.

24:56.590 --> 25:00.884
But before that happens, I need you
to just tell me where I can find Dickie.

25:01.303 --> 25:02.334
I don't know.

25:02.471 --> 25:04.345
The quicker I find him
and get him into custody,

25:04.473 --> 25:06.300
the safer you and your family are.

25:06.433 --> 25:10.217
Bennetts got what, 50 drying
sheds across a thousand acres?

25:10.354 --> 25:11.896
Dickie could be in any one of 'em.

25:12.231 --> 25:13.974
I'm gonna testify.

25:14.108 --> 25:16.681
But you got to find him on your own.

25:22.241 --> 25:24.732
For what it's worth,
it wasn't supposed to be her.

25:25.953 --> 25:28.242
We were there for Arlo

25:28.372 --> 25:30.828
for what he and Boyd
done to Dickie and all.

25:31.667 --> 25:34.419
What the hell is that supposed to mean,
"What he and Boyd done to Dickie"?

25:41.093 --> 25:42.421
Boyd?

25:43.929 --> 25:46.966
What was that bullshit you once said
about your outlaw days being behind you?

25:47.099 --> 25:48.379
I think you need to calm down, Raylan.

25:48.517 --> 25:49.762
Give me one reason
why I shouldn't come up there

25:49.893 --> 25:52.729
- and kick the living shit out of you.
- I'll give you 15 reasons in the mag

25:52.855 --> 25:53.969
and one in the chamber.

25:54.106 --> 25:55.269
You sure you can hit me from there?

25:55.399 --> 25:57.308
It's either me or the four people
inside this house

25:57.443 --> 26:00.230
with their guns already pointed at you.

26:00.404 --> 26:01.519
Is there a problem?

26:01.822 --> 26:02.985
Ava, get inside the house.

26:03.115 --> 26:06.032
No, I don't think I will.
This is my home.

26:10.247 --> 26:12.916
Well, you both make very good points.

26:14.877 --> 26:18.709
Raylan, I know you're angry.
I know you're frustrated.

26:19.757 --> 26:22.164
And if I am in any way responsible
for what has transpired,

26:22.301 --> 26:23.843
what has happened to
Helen, I am truly sorry.

26:23.969 --> 26:27.053
But I'm not the man
who pulled that trigger, Raylan.

26:27.473 --> 26:28.883
I can't find him.

26:29.058 --> 26:30.766
Well, we could draw him out.

26:30.893 --> 26:32.138
How would we do that?

26:32.353 --> 26:35.104
Take you to the middle of town,
tie you to a tree, and wait?

26:35.230 --> 26:37.223
Well, I'm glad to see you
found your sense of humour.

26:37.358 --> 26:38.353
I ain't joking, Boyd.

26:38.484 --> 26:40.441
I'm talking about going to Mags,

26:40.569 --> 26:42.894
Raylan, getting her to give him up.

26:43.030 --> 26:44.405
I tried that. She won't.

26:44.531 --> 26:47.153
That's 'cause you didn't play
your ace in the hole, my friend.

26:47.284 --> 26:49.158
- Which is?
- Black Pike.

26:49.995 --> 26:51.454
- What about it?
- Hands have been shaken,

26:51.580 --> 26:52.861
but the deal hasn't closed.

26:53.207 --> 26:54.321
You sure about that?

26:57.294 --> 27:00.081
Now, when you find Dickie, if you want,

27:01.215 --> 27:02.590
you can give me a call.

27:03.926 --> 27:05.503
So you can take care of him for me?

27:05.636 --> 27:06.834
What are friends for?

27:07.262 --> 27:11.177
Whatever needs to happen to Dickie Bennett,
I'd prefer to take care of that myself.

27:12.601 --> 27:13.632
Raylan?

27:15.312 --> 27:16.806
I know you and Ava have a history

27:18.023 --> 27:23.065
and you might assume that that
familiarity gives you a certain license.

27:23.195 --> 27:25.069
Well, it don't.

27:25.197 --> 27:28.815
That's twice you've disrespected her
in my presence.

27:28.951 --> 27:30.493
Don't let it happen a third.

27:55.310 --> 27:56.508
You come to get me out of here?

27:58.397 --> 28:00.306
- One condition.
- Oh, shit.

28:00.441 --> 28:03.110
You go to Mags,
take your property back from her,

28:03.318 --> 28:04.599
give it to Black Pike.

28:04.945 --> 28:06.736
- What?
- You heard me.

28:08.991 --> 28:11.529
I can't do that. Deal's already done.

28:11.660 --> 28:13.403
No, no, no. You can. I checked.

28:14.204 --> 28:17.787
Carol Johnson. You remember her.
Pretty redhead, says escrow hasn't closed.

28:17.916 --> 28:19.458
Property is still technically yours.

28:20.294 --> 28:22.452
So you will go to Mags,

28:23.005 --> 28:26.789
and unless she gives up Dickie,
back out, destroy the whole deal.

28:27.551 --> 28:29.045
No, I don't think I will.

28:31.054 --> 28:34.055
I don't understand you, Arlo.
Not for the life of me.

28:34.725 --> 28:36.931
I ain't giving back 150 grand.

28:37.060 --> 28:39.183
Why not?

28:39.313 --> 28:40.890
Helen's life ain't worth that to you?

28:41.106 --> 28:43.182
I don't need you to arrest Dickie.

28:43.317 --> 28:46.520
Let me out of here. I'll find him,
kill him myself for nothing.

28:46.653 --> 28:48.148
Sure you will.

28:50.365 --> 28:54.197
All this time,
knowing her blood was on your hands.

28:54.328 --> 28:56.735
- My hands? You killed a Bennett!
- Now you won't give up your payday

28:56.872 --> 28:58.948
so you can get her killer.

28:59.625 --> 29:02.412
Raylan! Raylan!

29:04.004 --> 29:05.712
- I'm sorry.
- I can't let you hurt a prisoner.

29:05.839 --> 29:07.962
You're right. It won't happen again.

29:08.425 --> 29:09.504
He's gonna be all right.

29:10.385 --> 29:12.841
As long as he does what's right!

29:12.971 --> 29:15.213
Now, let me talk to you in a language
I think you can understand.

29:15.349 --> 29:16.677
Think of this as a business deal.

29:17.351 --> 29:22.689
If I take down Dickie, you and Boyd can
have free rein over all of Harlan County.

29:23.232 --> 29:26.517
Don't matter what I do.
Mags won't give Dickie up.

29:32.699 --> 29:34.692
Yes, she will.

29:41.375 --> 29:42.750
Arlo Givens is outside.

29:43.043 --> 29:44.122
Alone?

29:45.671 --> 29:47.996
He wouldn't say what he wanted.

29:50.968 --> 29:51.999
Bring him on in.

29:59.726 --> 30:01.269
It's okay. You can go.

30:07.234 --> 30:08.349
Hello, Maggie.

30:08.735 --> 30:11.024
Wondered how long it would be
before you came to my door.

30:13.532 --> 30:14.777
You want a drink?

30:15.200 --> 30:16.694
You know I do.

30:24.167 --> 30:26.658
You understand I didn't have nothing
to do with it.

30:28.797 --> 30:30.790
Helen and I had called a truce.

30:33.093 --> 30:34.587
If you say so.

30:39.516 --> 30:41.722
But you still got to answer for Dickie.

30:42.269 --> 30:44.012
He's claiming you ripped him off.

30:44.146 --> 30:47.100
We did, with cause.

30:47.232 --> 30:50.067
Dickie came to Boyd,
reneged on the deal you made.

30:50.193 --> 30:51.438
Boyd took offence.

30:51.778 --> 30:55.646
Boyd should have come to me.
You should have come to me.

30:55.782 --> 30:58.534
We all had the sense
you'd stepped back from the life,

30:58.660 --> 31:00.452
with your mine deal.

31:02.831 --> 31:04.539
You want me to give up my son to you?

31:05.626 --> 31:08.199
It came to it,
you'd do the same to Raylan?

31:11.173 --> 31:16.415
Either you tell me where Dickie's at, or
I back out of the deal with Black Pike.

31:17.220 --> 31:21.004
- You're too late for that.
- No, I ain't. And you know it.

31:21.141 --> 31:25.803
Pot trade ain't what it used to be.
Without that deal, you got nothing.

31:32.069 --> 31:33.444
What'll you do if you get him?

31:33.654 --> 31:37.438
I'd kill him. But it ain't my decision.

31:39.201 --> 31:40.529
Raylan sent you?

31:40.952 --> 31:43.823
Wanted me to ask you,
what's the future worth?

32:02.224 --> 32:03.255
You get it done?

32:04.059 --> 32:05.470
It didn't work out.

32:11.733 --> 32:13.311
I had no choice, Dick.

32:15.862 --> 32:17.238
Does Mama know about this?

32:18.532 --> 32:20.323
She's the one who gave you up.

32:20.450 --> 32:24.068
- Seems you ain't worth protecting.
- God damn it, Raylan.

32:26.456 --> 32:28.828
Let's go, Doyle. We made a deal.

32:31.336 --> 32:34.171
I'm gonna need you
to turn around, Dick.

32:42.139 --> 32:44.012
Arms behind your back.

32:46.435 --> 32:47.633
Come here, let's go.

32:49.855 --> 32:51.728
Hope you're satisfied.

32:57.320 --> 32:58.815
Start walking.

33:05.412 --> 33:07.903
You don't have to do this.

33:11.460 --> 33:12.788
What did you say?

33:12.919 --> 33:17.628
I said... I said, you don't...
You don't have to do this, Raylan!

33:17.758 --> 33:19.501
Of course I do.

33:19.718 --> 33:21.212
This is who we are, Dickie.

33:21.720 --> 33:24.009
This is who we've always been.

33:24.639 --> 33:28.507
Givens, Bennetts, going on what?
Nearly a hundred years now.

33:29.394 --> 33:30.972
And this is how it ends.

33:33.774 --> 33:36.893
You didn't just say that!
It don't have to be like this,

33:37.027 --> 33:40.360
with handcuffs in the woods
in the middle of the night.

33:40.947 --> 33:43.652
You walked into my father's home

33:43.784 --> 33:46.357
and executed Helen
in her goddamn bathrobe.

33:46.495 --> 33:48.950
No, that was not the way
it went down, Raylan.

33:49.081 --> 33:50.279
Nobody executed her.

33:50.415 --> 33:52.657
She died because she had a shotgun
pointed at us.

33:52.793 --> 33:55.580
And she wouldn't listen
when I told her to put the gun down.

33:55.712 --> 33:58.084
I told her over and over again,
"Put the damn gun down,"

33:58.256 --> 34:00.000
but she wouldn't listen, Raylan.

34:00.133 --> 34:02.375
You know how she was, Raylan!

34:06.014 --> 34:09.382
Don't talk about her like you knew her.
You didn't know shit about her.

34:10.893 --> 34:13.467
That woman saved my life.
Did you know that?

34:14.356 --> 34:16.681
Criminal for a father,
working a deep mine,

34:16.858 --> 34:21.353
wondering, "What on earth
could come along and save me?"

34:22.822 --> 34:23.853
Helen did.

34:24.366 --> 34:26.987
She told me to leave this place behind,
be better than Arlo,

34:27.119 --> 34:29.656
and she gave me the money to do it.

34:31.831 --> 34:36.908
That woman raised her dead sister's kid
like he was her own

34:37.920 --> 34:39.248
because...

34:52.518 --> 34:53.634
God damn you, Dickie.

35:20.171 --> 35:21.370
Thanks for coming.

35:26.428 --> 35:28.420
It's peaceful.

35:28.555 --> 35:29.835
So quiet.

35:31.892 --> 35:33.137
Under different circumstances,

35:33.268 --> 35:35.841
I'm sure plenty of people
could have been happy here.

35:39.065 --> 35:40.892
I'm so sorry, Raylan.

36:01.963 --> 36:03.339
Mr. Givens.

36:15.226 --> 36:16.970
She had no regrets.

36:19.481 --> 36:21.604
Knew the life she'd chosen.

36:22.943 --> 36:25.778
She wouldn't have
done it any other way.

36:45.548 --> 36:47.588
"Lord, our God,

36:47.717 --> 36:49.674
"you are the source of life.

36:50.053 --> 36:53.671
"In you, we live and move
and have our being.

36:54.933 --> 36:57.340
"Keep us in life and death in your love,

36:58.228 --> 37:02.142
"and, by your grace,
lead us to your kingdom,

37:02.357 --> 37:04.266
"through your son, Jesus Christ."

38:02.125 --> 38:03.749
He's very sweet.

38:09.340 --> 38:10.716
- We can stay if you want.
- No.

38:10.842 --> 38:11.921
Okay.

38:12.052 --> 38:15.088
I want to leave right now, with you.

38:20.310 --> 38:21.769
- Tom.
- Raylan.

38:21.895 --> 38:22.926
You missed all the fun,

38:23.063 --> 38:24.854
but I think there's some food
if you're still hungry.

38:24.981 --> 38:27.104
- No, thanks.
- This is Winona.

38:27.233 --> 38:29.309
- How do you do?
- Ma'am.

38:29.444 --> 38:30.607
What brings you here?

38:30.737 --> 38:32.112
Raylan, I need a moment with you.

38:32.238 --> 38:33.519
Here and now is good.

38:35.075 --> 38:36.189
Okay.

38:36.326 --> 38:38.365
Jed Berwind had a
visitor a few hours ago.

38:38.536 --> 38:40.908
And shortly after she left,
he recanted his statement.

38:42.207 --> 38:45.291
Said he lied about everything,
that he was the one that killed Helen,

38:45.418 --> 38:48.040
and that you coerced him
into implicating Dickie.

38:48.171 --> 38:50.958
Says the Bennetts had
nothing to do with it.

38:51.091 --> 38:54.210
- Who was the visitor?
- We're looking into that.

39:30.213 --> 39:32.704
I'm... I'm sorry, Dickie.

39:35.385 --> 39:39.003
Couldn't let your troubles interfere
with what had to be done.

39:39.389 --> 39:42.758
The deal's all closed.
Ain't nobody can touch it now.

39:43.810 --> 39:47.760
Doyle's family's on their way
to our property up north.

39:47.897 --> 39:50.934
The future will be theirs,
and theirs alone.

39:53.653 --> 39:56.524
You see, son, you were right.

39:56.656 --> 39:58.067
I don't know who I was kidding.

39:58.449 --> 40:01.901
Can you see your old mama
sitting on some suburb porch

40:02.036 --> 40:04.076
cashing dividend cheques?

40:05.748 --> 40:06.780
No.

40:08.251 --> 40:10.208
This is where I belong.

40:19.637 --> 40:21.926
He put a gun to my head, Mama.

40:23.516 --> 40:25.888
I know, honey. I know.

40:29.397 --> 40:31.603
We'll take care of all that.

40:32.692 --> 40:34.317
Don't you worry.

40:40.742 --> 40:43.030
We'll take care of everything.
