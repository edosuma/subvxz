WEBVTT

01:36.722 --> 01:38.848
Son of a bitch!

01:41.185 --> 01:43.394
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

01:43.479 --> 01:46.522
- You practically busted my knee.
- Are you stalking me now?

01:46.607 --> 01:49.275
Stalking you?
I was protecting you.

01:49.359 --> 01:51.277
From what,
Southern perverts?

01:51.361 --> 01:53.488
Yeah, whatever.

01:53.572 --> 01:56.449
- I can't believe you.
- It's not that bad.

01:56.533 --> 01:59.410
It's my knee.
I'll tell you how bad it is.

02:00.412 --> 02:03.206
What the hell are you doing
all the way out here?

02:03.290 --> 02:06.834
This is the only place
the trees aren't picked clean.

02:06.919 --> 02:09.127
You shouldn't be here alone,
not after...

02:09.213 --> 02:11.798
No, I'm fine.
I can take care of myself.

02:11.882 --> 02:14.550
Oh, of course.
"I don't need protecting.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.594
I can take care of myself.

02:16.678 --> 02:19.055
Me Kate.
Me throw rock."

02:20.766 --> 02:23.184
What, you smell blood
on the wind?

02:23.268 --> 02:25.102
You don't hear that?

02:43.872 --> 02:45.248
What are you doing?

02:45.332 --> 02:47.583
I need to soak
my sore knee.

02:50.087 --> 02:52.421
Come on, Freckles.

02:52.923 --> 02:55.633
After all we've been through
on this damn island,

02:55.717 --> 02:58.052
don't we deserve
something good?

02:58.136 --> 03:00.096
What, you're gonna say no?

03:00.180 --> 03:03.516
Are you some sort of navel-gazing,
no-fun, mopey type?

03:15.445 --> 03:17.154
Well.

03:18.448 --> 03:21.784
It's chilly.
Come on, girl!

03:24.580 --> 03:26.372
It's nice, huh?

03:38.302 --> 03:40.970
Come on,
let's go to the rock.

04:52.459 --> 04:53.626
Are you OK?

04:53.710 --> 04:56.045
Yeah. You?

04:56.129 --> 04:57.797
Yeah. I'm gonna go
check 'em out.

04:57.881 --> 05:00.800
- Check 'em out for what?
- See what they got on 'em.

05:00.884 --> 05:02.301
Sawyer!

05:36.753 --> 05:38.170
Got myself a wallet.

05:38.255 --> 05:41.340
- You're disgusting.
- He ain't gonna miss it.

05:41.425 --> 05:43.509
Help me with that case.

05:43.593 --> 05:46.429
Oh, I'm disgusting,
but you're not?

05:46.513 --> 05:48.556
It's mine.

06:23.717 --> 06:26.719
You wouldn't happen to have
your key on you, would you?

06:42.944 --> 06:44.862
That case ain't yours, is it?

06:50.994 --> 06:52.453
No.

06:53.497 --> 06:55.247
Well.

06:56.333 --> 06:58.542
You wouldn't mind if I just...

06:59.753 --> 07:02.797
- Take it.
- I don't care.

07:04.466 --> 07:06.634
That's not what it looks like.

07:14.476 --> 07:17.353
Something you want to tell me
about this suitcase?

07:24.361 --> 07:25.861
Take it.

07:51.263 --> 07:53.639
Everything is getting washed out to sea!

07:53.723 --> 07:55.474
This can't be normal.

07:55.559 --> 07:57.560
The tide shifting so suddenly.

07:57.644 --> 08:00.146
Rising in so short a time.

08:00.230 --> 08:02.356
There's a lot not normal
around here.

08:02.440 --> 08:04.066
The rate this beach is eroding,

08:04.151 --> 08:06.819
the fuselage is going to
be underwater in days.

08:06.903 --> 08:10.573
We need to get all this stuff
off the beach before nightfall.

08:10.657 --> 08:13.325
I hope moving up the coast
will make a difference.

08:13.410 --> 08:16.954
It'd make a difference
if everyone moved inland.

08:17.038 --> 08:20.332
I think you'll find people
slightly wary of entering the jungle

08:20.417 --> 08:22.543
after what happened
to the pregnant girl,

08:22.627 --> 08:24.587
not to mention
whatever that thing is.

08:24.671 --> 08:26.422
Sayid...

08:28.091 --> 08:31.260
I need you to take me back
to the Frenchwoman, Rousseau.

08:31.344 --> 08:32.886
Claire's still out there.

08:32.971 --> 08:35.681
Now, Rousseau mentioned
that there are...

08:35.765 --> 08:38.058
- ...others on this island.
- Her mind is gone.

08:38.143 --> 08:39.852
- You heard them.
- I don't know.

08:39.936 --> 08:41.645
- You said that you...
- The wind.

08:42.606 --> 08:44.773
It was the wind playing tricks.

08:46.943 --> 08:49.987
Then what about the papers
that you took from her then?

08:50.071 --> 08:51.780
Documents, maps. Isn't there...

08:51.865 --> 08:55.743
I'm skilled at mathematics, but these
are beyond anything I've ever seen.

08:55.827 --> 08:59.705
There are these notes in French
accompanying the maps and diagrams.

08:59.789 --> 09:03.709
If I could translate them, I might be
able to make sense of it, but...

09:04.794 --> 09:06.212
What?

09:06.296 --> 09:09.381
Perhaps some things
are best left untranslated.

09:09.466 --> 09:10.549
Yeah?

09:10.634 --> 09:12.801
Maybe you should
tell him that.

09:29.653 --> 09:31.904
You're doing something productive.

09:31.988 --> 09:34.323
- Where have you been?
- What do you mean?

09:34.407 --> 09:38.244
You and Locke have been leaving before
sunrise and coming back after dark.

09:38.328 --> 09:40.496
What are you doing out there?

09:41.498 --> 09:43.832
Is he your new boyfriend?

09:49.547 --> 09:52.549
- We're looking for Claire.
- I thought there was no trail,

09:52.634 --> 09:56.345
- that no one knew where to look.
- Yeah, at least I'm doing something.

09:56.429 --> 09:59.682
Don't you see the way they look at us?
We're a joke.

10:00.475 --> 10:02.601
I'm trying to contribute something.

10:02.686 --> 10:05.813
And you're just...
you're useless.

10:45.395 --> 10:48.314
OK, Miss Ryan,
if you'll just give me some ID,

10:48.398 --> 10:50.816
we'll get started
on your loan app.

10:50.900 --> 10:53.444
OK. Here you go.

10:53.528 --> 10:56.780
So, what brings you
to New Mexico?

10:56.865 --> 10:59.325
- My work.
- What line of work is that?

10:59.409 --> 11:02.786
- I'm a photographer.
- What do you photograph?

11:02.871 --> 11:05.331
I've been commissioned
for a coffee table book.

11:05.415 --> 11:08.375
Pictures of old theaters
in small towns.

11:08.460 --> 11:10.544
There's a fantastic one
down in Rio Doso.

11:10.628 --> 11:12.838
You can't miss it.
It's off the main road.

11:12.922 --> 11:17.343
I'll have to make sure I give you
an acknowledgement, Mr... Hutton.

11:17.427 --> 11:18.969
Mark.

11:19.054 --> 11:21.764
Everyone down on the ground!
Down on the ground now!

11:24.392 --> 11:26.518
Don't even think about it!
Let's go!

11:26.603 --> 11:28.604
Shut up and move over there!
Let's go!

11:29.606 --> 11:32.733
- Who's back there? I see you!
- Big boy, get your ass down there!

11:33.443 --> 11:34.860
Get out! Let's go!

11:34.944 --> 11:36.653
All right!
Hold it right there!

11:37.614 --> 11:40.616
All right, girlie, get up
and get over there! Let's go! Move!

11:40.700 --> 11:43.410
Stay there!
Get down on the ground, bitch!

11:44.287 --> 11:46.121
Are you the manager?

11:46.206 --> 11:48.499
- I said, are you the manager?
- Yes.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.877
Good. Now let's open
the money cage now

11:51.961 --> 11:53.796
before people start getting killed.

11:54.381 --> 11:57.758
- Don't look at me! Look at the floor!
- Down right now!

11:57.842 --> 12:00.010
I said, down!

12:32.585 --> 12:34.002
Gotcha.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.504
Get off of me.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.423
I hate to bicker about positions,

12:37.507 --> 12:39.758
but I think
you're the one on top.

12:41.511 --> 12:43.887
Maybe you're not here
for the case at all.

12:48.518 --> 12:49.518
Woman!

12:51.271 --> 12:54.690
If you wanted to play rough,
all you had to do was say so.

12:59.028 --> 13:00.821
You wanna try for it again?

13:02.907 --> 13:05.117
Give it to me.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.411
No.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.286
We're quite close to the equator.

13:49.370 --> 13:51.872
The sun might be stronger
than what you're used to.

13:51.956 --> 13:53.874
I have a pretty good base.

13:58.087 --> 14:00.380
There was a matter
I was going to ask you about.

14:05.595 --> 14:07.054
What?

14:07.138 --> 14:08.764
I need a favor.

14:12.393 --> 14:15.437
I need your help translating papers
I took from Rousseau.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.523
- Who's Rousseau?
- The Frenchwoman.

14:17.607 --> 14:19.942
The distress call we intercepted.

14:26.616 --> 14:29.451
- Did my brother put you up to this?
- Your brother?

14:30.870 --> 14:32.329
No.

14:34.457 --> 14:37.543
The papers contain equations
with notations in French.

14:37.627 --> 14:41.296
- If I can understand the notations...
- Sorry, I can't do it.

14:42.090 --> 14:44.383
You're the only person
who speaks French.

14:44.467 --> 14:47.094
- I barely speak French.
- Please, Shannon.

14:47.178 --> 14:49.763
Can you at least try?

14:57.855 --> 14:59.398
Son of a bitch.

14:59.482 --> 15:01.441
You're wasting your time, man.

15:02.402 --> 15:05.904
If you pick the lock on a Halliburton,
I'll put you on my back and fly.

15:05.989 --> 15:08.532
You better find yourself
a runway, daddy,

15:08.616 --> 15:11.076
'cause there ain't a lock
I can't pick.

15:11.160 --> 15:14.955
- What's he trying to do?
- Pick the lock on a Halliburton.

15:16.833 --> 15:18.834
Good luck.

15:20.503 --> 15:25.424
The only way you're gonna open that case
is with pure force, impact velocity.

15:25.508 --> 15:28.427
- What's that mean?
- You gotta hit it with something hard

15:28.511 --> 15:32.681
like a sledgehammer.
Or the axe.

15:44.193 --> 15:46.320
- You got it.
- Yeah.

15:48.156 --> 15:49.531
Right there.

15:50.533 --> 15:52.659
Isn't there an easier way
to get there?

15:52.744 --> 15:55.329
The easiest way
isn't always the best.

15:55.413 --> 15:58.582
- Did anybody see you take it?
- No.

15:58.666 --> 16:01.293
- I don't think so.
- Well, which is it?

16:01.377 --> 16:02.794
Sorry?

16:02.879 --> 16:05.047
"No," or "I don't think so"?

16:07.884 --> 16:11.970
- No.
- Good. Let's get to work.

16:17.935 --> 16:20.020
Hello, Charlie.

16:20.605 --> 16:22.856
Oh, that's right.

16:22.940 --> 16:25.484
You're not talking much
these days.

16:25.568 --> 16:28.111
But it doesn't mean
you get to be rude.

16:29.030 --> 16:31.156
Excuse me?

16:31.240 --> 16:32.741
Everybody else

16:32.825 --> 16:35.869
is helping us
move the camp up the beach,

16:35.953 --> 16:38.830
- except for you.
- Are you serious?

16:38.915 --> 16:41.833
You think you're the only one
with something to be sad about?

16:41.918 --> 16:45.003
I got sob stories for you,
so why don't you grab

16:45.088 --> 16:47.255
the other end of this thing
and help me?

16:52.011 --> 16:53.887
Well?

17:07.109 --> 17:10.820
Come on.

17:27.505 --> 17:30.048
Impact velocity...

17:30.133 --> 17:31.967
Physics, my ass.

17:33.469 --> 17:35.262
All right.

17:40.476 --> 17:42.769
Son of a...

17:42.854 --> 17:44.521
Unbelievable.

17:52.488 --> 17:54.030
Don't even think about it.

17:58.661 --> 18:00.328
Damn it.

18:30.193 --> 18:34.154
Hell, Freckles, I knew you wanted it.
I just didn't know how bad.

18:35.281 --> 18:37.824
You're gonna have to come up
with a new move.

18:37.909 --> 18:39.409
God.

18:39.494 --> 18:41.620
OK. OK!

18:41.704 --> 18:43.830
OK, this is just silly.

18:45.208 --> 18:47.125
Hold on.
I got a proposition for you.

18:47.210 --> 18:50.170
You tell me what's inside,
and I'll give it to you.

18:50.254 --> 18:51.713
Are you serious?

18:54.342 --> 18:56.593
Hell, no way
to open the damn thing.

18:56.677 --> 18:59.888
At this point, all I care about
is satisfying my own curiosity.

19:02.141 --> 19:05.727
Easy, sweetheart.
I don't really care what it is.

19:06.771 --> 19:10.357
What's burning me up
is why it means so much to you.

19:14.779 --> 19:17.405
Last chance.

19:22.620 --> 19:23.954
All right.

19:29.544 --> 19:31.419
Give me the key now.

19:31.504 --> 19:34.005
I'm tired of asking nice.

19:34.090 --> 19:36.508
Give me the money cage key now.

19:36.592 --> 19:38.677
You're going to kill me.
Why would I...

19:38.761 --> 19:41.179
You think we're having
a conversation here?

19:41.264 --> 19:43.515
Everybody be cool!
Do you wanna go home?

19:43.599 --> 19:46.852
Don't look at me! Look at the floor!
Everybody calm. Stay down.

19:46.936 --> 19:49.020
Listen to me, I am not
gonna ask you again.

19:49.105 --> 19:50.522
I want that key!

19:50.606 --> 19:52.858
- I can take him.
- What?

19:52.942 --> 19:55.277
The tall guy,
he's not watching us.

19:55.361 --> 19:58.154
It's now or never.
Keep your head down.

20:00.157 --> 20:01.825
Hey! Watch out!

20:04.829 --> 20:06.121
Pick it up!

20:07.331 --> 20:09.624
Pick it up!
Shoot him!

20:10.793 --> 20:12.377
What's wrong?
Shoot the gun!

20:12.461 --> 20:14.170
- Cover him!
- Shoot him!

20:15.798 --> 20:17.883
- Turn off the safety!
- Gimme that.

20:17.967 --> 20:20.218
It's on the side!
Turn it off!

20:20.303 --> 20:22.804
I don't know
how to use a gun!

20:24.140 --> 20:26.182
You wanna get shot, fat boy?

20:28.811 --> 20:30.729
- OK, hero.
- No, please, don't.

20:30.813 --> 20:33.148
Shut up! Let's you and me go talk.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.484
Right in here.
Let's go.

20:45.328 --> 20:48.079
"I don't know how to use a gun"?

20:48.164 --> 20:50.081
That's classic.

21:15.858 --> 21:18.360
You never said anything
about math.

21:19.445 --> 21:22.364
You worry about the French.
I'll take care of the math.

21:25.201 --> 21:27.994
I can't do this.

21:28.079 --> 21:30.956
If you really put your mind to it,
I know you can.

21:34.794 --> 21:37.629
Where did you learn
to speak French?

21:37.713 --> 21:39.589
I knew this guy.

21:42.426 --> 21:45.303
- This guy?
- In France, in St. Tropez.

21:45.388 --> 21:47.555
I kind of lived there for a while.

21:48.557 --> 21:52.727
Well, they say that is the best way
to learn a foreign language.

22:00.194 --> 22:01.695
All right.

22:02.488 --> 22:04.739
Let me see.

22:08.536 --> 22:10.120
So...

22:13.708 --> 22:15.834
What is this?
What is it for?

22:24.135 --> 22:26.177
A headache.

22:26.262 --> 22:29.055
Oh. Cool.

22:29.140 --> 22:31.057
All right.

22:35.271 --> 22:38.732
- We got a problem.
- We have a problem, or...

22:39.692 --> 22:41.860
...you have a problem?

22:48.200 --> 22:51.703
You're the only one
who knows about me.

22:55.666 --> 22:57.709
Before I left for Sydney,

22:57.793 --> 23:00.920
the marshal who was escorting me,
he had this silver case.

23:01.005 --> 23:03.590
The airline wouldn't let him
bring it on the plane.

23:03.674 --> 23:07.010
It was hard enough trying
to convince them to let him wear a gun.

23:07.094 --> 23:10.305
But the case,
they made him check it.

23:10.389 --> 23:12.849
What was in the case?

23:12.933 --> 23:16.186
Some traveling money.
Some of his personal stuff.

23:17.980 --> 23:21.733
And four 9 millimeters
with a few boxes of ammo.

23:21.817 --> 23:23.902
- Guns.
- Guns.

23:31.077 --> 23:34.871
- So, where is the case now?
- Sawyer has it.

23:36.665 --> 23:39.084
- He hasn't been able to open it.
- Lucky for us.

23:39.168 --> 23:41.711
He will.
Sooner or later.

23:44.006 --> 23:45.840
So, what do you need me to do?

23:49.011 --> 23:52.055
I know where the key is. He...

23:52.807 --> 23:55.183
The marshal kept it
in his wallet,

23:55.267 --> 23:57.227
in his back pocket.

23:59.897 --> 24:02.857
- I buried him, Kate.
- I know.

24:03.859 --> 24:05.068
Where?

24:10.825 --> 24:14.285
- So what else is in the case?
- What?

24:14.370 --> 24:16.121
What else is in the case?

24:16.205 --> 24:17.914
Nothing.

24:19.667 --> 24:23.586
- That's the truth?
- Just the guns.

24:31.554 --> 24:33.638
If you want my help,

24:34.765 --> 24:36.724
we're gonna open
the case together.

24:38.227 --> 24:44.566
OK.

24:47.903 --> 24:50.905
- Why are you smiling?
- Am I?

24:50.990 --> 24:53.533
You look happy.

24:53.617 --> 24:55.285
Well, I guess I must be then.

24:56.537 --> 24:58.413
There's no reason.
Things are awful.

24:58.497 --> 25:01.291
- They're not awful.
- We're stranded on an island.

25:01.375 --> 25:04.210
- No one's coming for us.
- You don't know that.

25:04.295 --> 25:07.130
Well, what I do know

25:07.214 --> 25:10.091
is there's something in that jungle
that eats people.

25:10.176 --> 25:14.304
Just because we've not heard from it
doesn't mean it won't get hungry again.

25:14.388 --> 25:18.474
And I know there's a person or people
that are trying to hurt us.

25:18.559 --> 25:20.101
- Charlie.
- And...

25:21.437 --> 25:23.188
Nobody blames you.

25:23.272 --> 25:24.689
What?

25:24.773 --> 25:26.399
For what happened to Claire.

25:26.483 --> 25:28.902
It's not your fault.

25:28.986 --> 25:31.696
You did everything
that you could do,

25:31.780 --> 25:35.116
and you came very close
to dying yourself.

25:36.035 --> 25:37.785
Yeah.

25:40.039 --> 25:43.124
Maybe I should have died.

25:43.209 --> 25:45.793
You know what I think, Charlie?

25:49.381 --> 25:51.174
You need to ask for help.

25:52.384 --> 25:54.469
Who's gonna help me?

25:58.724 --> 26:01.351
So why didn't you
put him with the others?

26:01.435 --> 26:03.144
When you burned the fuselage?

26:06.649 --> 26:09.067
Because I needed
to bury him.

26:22.414 --> 26:25.041
- So you ready to do this?
- Hell, yeah.

26:25.125 --> 26:27.252
By now their imaginations
are running wild.

26:27.336 --> 26:30.296
Don't hold back. He won't talk
if the details are off.

26:30.381 --> 26:32.006
You and your details, Maggie.

26:36.845 --> 26:38.888
- OK, hero.
- No, please, don't.

26:38.973 --> 26:41.933
Shut up!
Everybody just relax!

26:43.769 --> 26:46.437
- I said quiet.
- OK, Mr. Manager,

26:46.522 --> 26:48.022
you want to be a hard-ass?

26:48.107 --> 26:50.692
Protect a vault that doesn't
even belong to you?

26:50.776 --> 26:53.945
OK.
There's gonna be consequences.

26:54.029 --> 26:57.865
- He's gonna kill me anyway.
- I swear, if you don't shut up.

26:59.994 --> 27:02.787
You got three seconds
to give me that damn key.

27:02.871 --> 27:04.789
One...

27:04.873 --> 27:07.458
Two...

27:07.543 --> 27:08.876
- Three.
- All right.

27:10.045 --> 27:12.338
I'll give it to you.

27:12.423 --> 27:14.882
Good. Let's go.

27:14.967 --> 27:16.801
Right around here.

27:16.885 --> 27:18.386
Let's go.

27:42.578 --> 27:44.746
- You all right?
- Compared to what?

27:45.748 --> 27:48.791
- You want me to...
- No. I'll do it.

27:48.876 --> 27:50.585
Oh, God.

28:03.307 --> 28:05.183
- Did you get it?
- Yeah.

28:27.456 --> 28:30.166
The key isn't in here.

28:30.250 --> 28:32.377
It isn't?

28:34.755 --> 28:38.591
That was real good sleight of hand
distracting me with the wallet.

28:43.931 --> 28:45.306
Open it.

28:57.694 --> 29:02.198
Don't.

29:19.591 --> 29:22.051
"The sea of sparkles?"
No, wait.

29:22.136 --> 29:25.721
"The sea of silver sparkles
that change."

29:27.182 --> 29:30.017
- It's the same as the last one.
- Are you sure?

29:32.229 --> 29:35.106
The equation is different.
It doesn't relate.

29:35.190 --> 29:37.692
What you're saying
doesn't make any sense.

29:38.861 --> 29:40.069
OK.

29:40.154 --> 29:42.155
What about this one?

29:42.239 --> 29:44.407
It should say something
about latitude.

29:44.491 --> 29:47.243
- Something about the stars.
- Give me some room.

29:50.998 --> 29:53.541
"Next to the pond... blue..."

29:55.169 --> 29:57.128
"Blue eternity."

29:57.963 --> 30:00.214
No, wait, no.
"Blue infinity."

30:00.299 --> 30:02.550
- "Blue infinity"?
- "Blue infinity."

30:04.219 --> 30:06.721
There's something about this
that is so familiar.

30:06.805 --> 30:09.724
You've been telling me what sounds
very much like nonsense

30:09.808 --> 30:12.477
for the past hour,
and now it seems familiar?

30:12.561 --> 30:16.481
OK, A: I told you
that my French sucks.

30:16.565 --> 30:19.650
And B: This isn't
my nonsense, OK?

30:19.735 --> 30:23.821
Do you ever think that after 16 years
on Mystery Frickin' Island,

30:23.906 --> 30:26.699
your friend might not be
quite adjusted?

30:29.661 --> 30:31.704
This was a mistake.

30:33.332 --> 30:34.999
Yeah.

30:35.083 --> 30:38.127
Haven't you heard?
I'm completely useless.

30:48.931 --> 30:50.640
Sawyer?

30:51.934 --> 30:53.768
Doctor.

30:55.854 --> 30:58.814
So what can I do you for?

31:00.943 --> 31:04.862
Figured she'd get you
to do her dirty work for her.

31:04.947 --> 31:07.448
So, what?
We gonna wrestle for it?

31:07.533 --> 31:09.367
No, you're gonna
give it to me.

31:09.451 --> 31:11.369
- Am I?
- Yeah.

31:11.453 --> 31:13.996
I'm just gonna give it to you?

31:14.081 --> 31:15.540
Yeah.

31:15.624 --> 31:18.501
- Why would I want to do that?
- Cephalexin.

31:19.962 --> 31:21.295
Yeah? Go on.

31:21.380 --> 31:25.800
That's the antibiotic I'm giving you
for the knife wound in your arm.

31:25.884 --> 31:29.804
You're in the middle of a cycle.
If I keep giving you the pills,

31:29.888 --> 31:32.390
you're gonna be
as right as rain.

31:32.474 --> 31:35.226
But I'm gonna stop
giving you the pills.

31:35.310 --> 31:38.354
For two days you're gonna
think you're all good.

31:38.438 --> 31:40.481
Then it's gonna start to itch.

31:41.316 --> 31:44.402
The day after, the fever will come
and you'll see red lines

31:44.486 --> 31:47.989
running up and down your arm.
Day or two after that...

31:48.657 --> 31:53.244
...you'll beg me to take the case
just to cut off your arm.

31:54.705 --> 31:56.789
That's a nice story, Jack.

31:56.873 --> 31:59.208
And even if it were true,

31:59.835 --> 32:01.544
I don't think you could do it.

32:03.839 --> 32:05.756
You're wrong.

32:11.013 --> 32:13.431
She tell you what's inside?

32:16.351 --> 32:18.436
Yeah, me neither.

32:19.688 --> 32:23.441
Hope you got yourself some jaws of life
back in Cave Town.

32:23.525 --> 32:25.901
That's what it's gonna take
to pop this bitch.

32:25.986 --> 32:28.362
I'll figure something out.

32:31.533 --> 32:34.285
I know you think
you're doing her a favor,

32:34.369 --> 32:37.496
but however she talked you
into doing this,

32:37.581 --> 32:39.248
she lied, brother.

33:02.397 --> 33:04.023
We're gonna do this together.

33:06.109 --> 33:08.569
- Why?
- Because that's what I said we'd do.

33:16.244 --> 33:18.704
What are you waiting for?
Open the damn thing!

33:19.873 --> 33:22.583
Hell, now we're talking.
Don't move.

33:24.127 --> 33:26.671
- Please don't. I...
- Shut up.

33:34.179 --> 33:37.348
I let you in.
Now please let the girl go.

33:40.644 --> 33:42.353
Let the girl go?

33:43.855 --> 33:46.982
Man, you have no idea,
do you?

33:47.067 --> 33:49.860
The girl is the one
who set you up.

33:49.945 --> 33:53.864
The girl picked this bank.
Picked this vault.

33:53.949 --> 33:56.117
This whole thing
is the girl's idea.

33:59.913 --> 34:03.374
- What are you doing?
- Easy, Maggie.

34:03.458 --> 34:05.126
Just cleaning up after myself.

34:11.049 --> 34:13.300
You shoot, I shoot.

34:14.469 --> 34:17.138
- Wait. What?
- I said no one gets hurt.

34:18.473 --> 34:20.474
I know you're cold, baby.

34:20.559 --> 34:23.185
But you're not that cold.

34:27.399 --> 34:30.067
What the hell is going on here?

34:30.152 --> 34:33.195
- You shot me, you stupid bitch!
- Shut up, Jason.

34:33.280 --> 34:35.072
I told you not to trust her!

34:35.157 --> 34:38.074
I need the key
to safety deposit box 815 now.

34:38.159 --> 34:41.036
- Who are you?
- The key to the box now.

34:41.121 --> 34:43.496
You need two keys,
the bank's and...

34:43.581 --> 34:45.583
If you had the customer key, why...

34:45.667 --> 34:47.251
I'm not on the signatory card.

34:47.335 --> 34:49.920
You put me up to this
to get into a safe deposit box?

34:50.005 --> 34:52.757
I swear to God,
you better kill me,

34:52.841 --> 34:56.469
- 'cause if you don't...
- My name's not Maggie. Now go.

35:10.609 --> 35:12.359
Anything you want to tell me?

35:16.865 --> 35:18.657
All right then.

35:55.862 --> 35:57.655
Is this it?

35:57.739 --> 36:00.032
Is this what you wanted?

36:28.103 --> 36:30.104
What is it?

36:32.649 --> 36:35.192
- It's nothing.
- What is it, Kate?

36:35.277 --> 36:37.528
You wouldn't understand.

36:37.612 --> 36:39.446
I want the truth.

36:39.531 --> 36:42.825
Just this once.
What is it?

36:44.202 --> 36:46.704
- It belonged to the man I loved.
- The truth.

36:46.788 --> 36:48.622
It belonged
to the man I loved!

36:48.707 --> 36:50.207
Stop lying to me!
The truth!

36:50.292 --> 36:53.252
It belonged to the man I killed!

38:36.022 --> 38:38.732
Your husband was in the tail section
of the plane.

38:39.818 --> 38:41.860
Yes, he was.

38:42.946 --> 38:44.905
But he'll be back.

38:46.616 --> 38:48.951
You think he's still alive?

38:49.035 --> 38:51.078
I know he is.

38:53.081 --> 38:55.332
How?

38:55.417 --> 38:56.959
I just do.

38:59.587 --> 39:03.549
It's a fine line
between denial and faith.

39:03.633 --> 39:06.677
It's much better on my side.

39:24.904 --> 39:26.363
Help me.

39:26.448 --> 39:28.240
Baby...

39:30.618 --> 39:32.995
I'm not the one
that can help you.

39:45.592 --> 39:48.218
Heavenly father,

39:49.054 --> 39:50.888
we thank you.

39:52.182 --> 39:56.935
We thank you for bringing us
together tonight.

39:57.896 --> 40:00.773
And we ask,

40:00.857 --> 40:04.651
that you show Charlie the path...

40:32.263 --> 40:34.598
The guy from St. Tropez,

40:35.725 --> 40:38.602
he had this kid.

40:38.686 --> 40:41.772
A real snot,
who hated me.

40:41.856 --> 40:43.273
His name was Laurent.

40:43.358 --> 40:47.611
He watched this movie
over and over and over again

40:47.695 --> 40:50.823
every day, all day, like kids do,
900 times.

40:50.907 --> 40:53.450
It was the cartoon about fish.

40:54.786 --> 40:56.620
You know,
one of the computer ones.

40:56.704 --> 40:58.622
Why are you telling me this?

40:58.706 --> 41:00.707
The movie was dubbed in French,

41:00.792 --> 41:03.127
and at the end,
there was this song.

41:04.295 --> 41:08.549
Those notations,
they're song lyrics.

41:08.633 --> 41:10.634
And your Frenchwoman,

41:10.718 --> 41:12.469
she's just like Laurent,

41:12.554 --> 41:15.097
'cause she wrote them
over and over again.

41:16.266 --> 41:18.183
What's the song?
