WEBVTT

00:10.560 --> 00:12.915
I can't believe Dad's
kicking us out of the house...

00:13.120 --> 00:14.792
...just to watch some stupid movie.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.274
Oh, it's okay, honey.

00:16.480 --> 00:20.109
You and I are gonna have
a terrific time at this strip show.

00:20.320 --> 00:24.279
It'll be just like your 12th birthday
all over again.

00:24.840 --> 00:28.389
Okay, but this time
you're the designated driver.

00:28.600 --> 00:30.591
All right, let's check our equipment.

00:30.800 --> 00:33.109
- Ones and fives.
- Check.

00:33.320 --> 00:36.118
- Wesson oil.
- Check.

00:36.640 --> 00:39.598
A driver's licence,
just in case I get carded.

00:39.800 --> 00:41.995
That's a good one, Mom.

00:44.120 --> 00:46.236
I mean, check.

00:57.920 --> 00:59.876
It was a bad day today, Peg.

01:01.160 --> 01:04.152
One minute, the biggest woman
in the world was in front of me.

01:04.360 --> 01:08.797
I was trying to wedge a size four
on her foot with my lucky shoehorn...

01:09.480 --> 01:11.550
...the next minute, she was gone.

01:12.120 --> 01:14.588
The woman died in your store?

01:14.800 --> 01:18.031
Not the woman, Peg, the shoehorn.

01:19.400 --> 01:21.311
Look at it, Peg.

01:23.120 --> 01:25.509
Crushed like a beer can
at a Raiders game.

01:27.120 --> 01:28.109
I'll tell you, Peg...

01:28.320 --> 01:32.438
...the only thing that kept me going
was knowing that tonight is the night.

01:32.640 --> 01:34.392
Oh, don't worry, honey.

01:34.600 --> 01:38.036
We will be gone
by the time your little movie starts.

01:38.240 --> 01:41.550
<i>Death Wish 6 is not a little movie.</i>

01:41.760 --> 01:43.716
It is a once-in-a-lifetime...

01:43.920 --> 01:47.993
...3-D, splatter-vision,
pay-per-view event.

01:57.960 --> 01:59.439
Guys...

02:05.200 --> 02:06.952
...I need the house to myself tonight.

02:07.160 --> 02:09.354
My pen pal, Starla,
just got out of prison...

02:09.560 --> 02:11.710
...and she's coming here to see me.

02:11.920 --> 02:13.273
What does she look like?

02:13.480 --> 02:16.313
Supposedly, like Cindy Crawford,
but who cares?

02:16.560 --> 02:20.109
She's under 30 and hasn't
been touched by a man in years.

02:20.320 --> 02:23.437
Oh, she's just like me.

02:23.640 --> 02:27.758
Except that your crimes continue
to go unpunished.

02:28.840 --> 02:30.432
Go away.

02:31.400 --> 02:33.038
Dad, Starla and I need some privacy.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.629
She's gonna do a body search.

02:36.560 --> 02:38.835
And I've hidden things.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.276
You all have exactly 12 and a half
minutes to vacate the premises.

02:43.480 --> 02:46.472
I have every movement timed
down to the final second...

02:46.680 --> 02:48.318
...including this one.

02:54.080 --> 02:55.308
Come on, Mom, let's go.

02:55.520 --> 02:58.353
We want to get a pole-side table,
don't we?

02:58.560 --> 03:01.028
Wait a minute, honey.
Come help me find my punch card.

03:01.240 --> 03:04.073
I think I'm due a free lap dance.

03:13.840 --> 03:16.638
I'm looking for Bud Bundy.

03:16.840 --> 03:18.319
I'm Bud.

03:18.520 --> 03:20.715
And you must be Starla?

03:20.920 --> 03:23.912
You don't look like Brad Pitt.

03:25.840 --> 03:28.752
And you don't look like
Cindy Crawford either.

03:28.960 --> 03:30.393
No.

03:30.600 --> 03:32.158
But I've got a gun.

03:32.360 --> 03:34.351
This is a holdup.

03:35.440 --> 03:37.829
- Come on.
- I hope you don't think I'm weird...

03:38.040 --> 03:40.554
...but this is kind of turning me on
a little bit.

03:40.760 --> 03:42.557
Sicko.

03:43.560 --> 03:46.632
You told me you lived
in a French provincial estate.

03:46.840 --> 03:49.035
My cell is nicer than this dump.

03:49.240 --> 03:52.277
Starla, I lied to you because I knew
I wasn't good enough for you.

03:52.480 --> 03:54.357
And we don't-
We don't have any money.

03:54.560 --> 03:57.518
And I don't play for the Bulls either.

03:58.680 --> 04:00.796
I ought to beat you up.

04:01.600 --> 04:03.955
Would you mind
putting on a nightie first?

04:04.720 --> 04:07.712
All right, guys. Oh, hey. Bye.

04:07.920 --> 04:09.433
Oh, good, your friend came.

04:09.640 --> 04:11.596
- You guys have a great time.
- Hey, hey, hey.

04:12.680 --> 04:15.035
I'm on the run,
I've got nothing to lose.

04:15.240 --> 04:18.755
Either you and your sisters cooperate,
or someone's gonna get hurt.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.712
Sisters?

04:23.080 --> 04:24.433
I like her.

05:02.800 --> 05:04.233
Mom, I'm scared.

05:04.440 --> 05:07.113
Don't worry, honey. She doesn't know
that Daddy's upstairs.

05:07.320 --> 05:09.231
He's our secret weapon.

05:09.760 --> 05:12.638
Yeah, if he leaves
the bathroom door open.

05:13.560 --> 05:14.879
Yoo-hoo.

05:16.520 --> 05:18.750
What are you doing?
I told you to wait in the car.

05:18.960 --> 05:20.313
Thought you might need help...

05:20.520 --> 05:22.670
...carrying that picnic lunch
your friends made.

05:22.880 --> 05:26.270
Howdy, I'm Lonnie.
I'm Starla's boyfriend.

05:26.680 --> 05:29.319
Starla, where did you get that gun?

05:29.520 --> 05:31.556
Wake up, Jethro.

05:32.960 --> 05:35.428
She's escaped from prison.

05:35.880 --> 05:40.112
She didn't escape.
I was right there, picking her up.

05:40.320 --> 05:43.756
They let her out that special
drainpipe exit in the woods.

05:44.480 --> 05:47.199
So the media wouldn't harass her.

05:48.040 --> 05:49.678
Mom...

05:50.120 --> 05:53.192
...I can't believe she dumped me
for this guy.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.078
He's a total moron.

06:03.960 --> 06:07.589
Now, we're gonna need a getaway car.
We are taking the Porsche.

06:07.800 --> 06:10.189
No, not the Porsche.

06:10.400 --> 06:11.594
Give Lonnie the keys.

06:20.480 --> 06:22.038
Thank you.

06:22.240 --> 06:23.958
I'm Kelly.

06:24.840 --> 06:27.400
The garage is through that door.

06:35.840 --> 06:38.832
Now, we're gonna need some food
for the road.

06:39.040 --> 06:40.553
You.

06:40.760 --> 06:42.876
Go cook us something.

06:45.880 --> 06:48.030
You animal.

06:49.120 --> 06:51.236
Don't think about
trying to poison us either.

06:51.440 --> 06:53.874
Yeah, she doesn't have
to think about it...

06:54.080 --> 06:55.877
...it just sort of happens.

06:56.440 --> 06:58.954
All right. It's okay, Mom,
that's okay, it's okay.

07:03.520 --> 07:06.193
Now, I may not be
the best mechanic in town...

07:06.400 --> 07:08.994
...but I'm pretty sure
that's not a Porsche.

07:11.040 --> 07:13.315
May not even be a car.

07:14.640 --> 07:16.756
He's so smart.

07:19.280 --> 07:22.113
It's Jefferson. Is anyone home?

07:22.320 --> 07:23.389
That's our neighbour.

07:23.600 --> 07:26.672
You better surrender now
because he used to be with the CIA...

07:26.880 --> 07:28.598
...and he is a trained killer.

07:39.400 --> 07:42.790
Sorry to just " barge" in.

07:44.520 --> 07:46.556
Oh, Marcy and I had to show you
our costumes.

07:46.760 --> 07:49.832
We're going
on a charity masquerade cruise.

07:52.400 --> 07:55.312
Little Bo Peep
has lost her sheep and-

07:55.520 --> 07:58.717
Oh, sorry, I didn't know
you had company.

07:58.920 --> 08:02.071
Wow, are you guys going
on the cruise too?

08:02.280 --> 08:05.272
What great costumes.
Wait, let me guess.

08:05.520 --> 08:08.717
Grease monkey and...

08:08.920 --> 08:11.673
...psychotic trailer trash, right?

08:13.240 --> 08:15.595
- Marcy-
- Oh, I love your props.

08:15.800 --> 08:18.075
They're so lifelike.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.556
Eat lead, street scum.

08:21.760 --> 08:24.513
- Shoot her.
- Shoot her.

08:24.720 --> 08:27.109
Bang, bang, you're dead.

08:27.600 --> 08:29.192
This is such fun. There you go.

08:29.400 --> 08:31.152
Don't give her the gun.

08:31.360 --> 08:34.750
No, fun is busting a cap
in Little Bo Peep's ass.

08:36.280 --> 08:38.589
Marcy, this is Starla.

08:38.799 --> 08:41.394
She's broken out of prison,
and she's here to rob us.

08:41.600 --> 08:43.192
Of what?

08:44.400 --> 08:46.197
Everybody in the corner.

08:46.400 --> 08:48.197
Jefferson, do something.

08:48.400 --> 08:49.913
Okay.

08:51.480 --> 08:53.869
Exactly which corner would you like?
Right.

08:54.080 --> 08:55.752
Everybody, shut up, I gotta think.

08:55.960 --> 08:59.077
Yeah, Starla really surprised me
with this whole thing.

08:59.280 --> 09:02.431
I didn't even have time
to learn how to speak Canadian.

09:03.640 --> 09:05.153
Yeah, I know what you mean.

09:05.360 --> 09:08.830
I always wanted to go to Australia,
but I don't speak a word of Australian.

09:09.040 --> 09:12.476
Oh, except for " koala. "

09:14.520 --> 09:16.590
I love koalas.

09:16.800 --> 09:19.030
I got one tattooed on my...

09:20.320 --> 09:23.551
Starla doesn't like it.
She says it makes me look cheap.

09:23.760 --> 09:25.478
What are you doing
with her anyway?

09:25.680 --> 09:28.274
I mean, don't you think
she's kind of trampy?

09:28.480 --> 09:30.835
Well, that's my type.

09:31.040 --> 09:34.828
Besides, Starla said it'd be real hard
for me to find another girlfriend...

09:35.040 --> 09:36.519
...on account of how ugly I am.

09:38.640 --> 09:39.595
Get away from her.

09:39.800 --> 09:41.711
She's very moody.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.309
We have got to get
the gun away from her.

09:45.520 --> 09:48.830
Now, we need someone big
and strong and expendable.

09:49.040 --> 09:50.871
Where is your father?

09:51.080 --> 09:53.833
Hey, you told me
your father was dead.

09:54.040 --> 09:55.553
That's right, he died.

09:59.880 --> 10:02.553
Before he could fix the plumbing.

10:02.760 --> 10:05.149
<i>Old Charles Bronson had a gun</i>

10:05.360 --> 10:07.794
<i>Eee-eye-eee-eye-oh</i>

10:08.160 --> 10:10.594
<i>With this gun he killed some scum</i>

10:10.800 --> 10:11.755
<i>Eee-eye-eee-eye-</i>

10:11.960 --> 10:13.234
Oh.

10:14.880 --> 10:17.189
You're from the cable company,
aren't you?

10:18.720 --> 10:20.915
Al, she's not from
the cable company.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.918
She's Bud's pen pal,
and she's come here to rob us.

10:24.120 --> 10:27.669
You see, that's why we don't allow you
to have friends, Bud.

10:29.560 --> 10:33.599
Now, listen, you're obviously
disappointed in Bud. We are too.

10:33.880 --> 10:36.440
But, you see,
I already paid for this movie...

10:36.640 --> 10:41.634
...and I had to buy a 200-ounce
bladder buster to get these here.

10:41.840 --> 10:43.717
So why don't you just go-

10:43.920 --> 10:46.798
Oh, my God.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.309
My baby.

10:57.200 --> 11:00.749
Oh, why, why, why?

11:03.160 --> 11:05.720
Poor Clicky.

11:06.440 --> 11:11.434
So young and so many
channels left to change.

11:11.640 --> 11:15.519
Oh, yeah, big, tough broad picking on
a helpless little remote, aren't you?

11:16.320 --> 11:18.470
Wouldn't be tough without that gun,
would you?

11:18.680 --> 11:20.955
No, you idiot, that's why I've got it.

11:21.520 --> 11:22.873
Kind of what I said, isn't it?

11:27.120 --> 11:30.112
Oh, Al, I'm afraid. Hold me.

11:30.320 --> 11:31.992
Peg, Peg, my life's in danger here...

11:32.200 --> 11:34.998
...it's important I maintain
my will to live.

11:38.560 --> 11:39.595
Okay, Dad...

11:39.800 --> 11:42.872
...we've got to come up with a plan.
What would Charles Bronson do?

11:43.080 --> 11:44.957
Well, he'd usually
go on a revenge spree...

11:45.160 --> 11:47.799
...after his loved ones
were brutally slaughtered.

11:48.520 --> 11:50.988
- Think of something else.
- All right.

11:51.200 --> 11:52.792
All right, I've come up with a plan.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.389
It's dangerous and risky,
I'll need a volunteer.

11:55.600 --> 11:57.033
- Croquet injury.
- Stubbed my toe.

11:57.240 --> 11:58.355
Thanks a lot.

11:58.560 --> 12:00.596
Lucky. Lucky, here, boy.

12:00.800 --> 12:03.030
Go get the cops, go get the cops.

12:03.240 --> 12:04.798
Good boy.

12:05.520 --> 12:08.637
What a good dog.
Loyal, strong and brave.

12:13.240 --> 12:15.629
We may need an alternate plan.

12:15.840 --> 12:16.875
I've got another idea.

12:17.080 --> 12:22.712
Are you going to command a squadron
of flies from your hamper to attack?

12:23.280 --> 12:27.478
If I could command those flies,
do you think you'd still be alive?

12:28.920 --> 12:31.354
Al, please do something.

12:31.560 --> 12:32.879
I'm about to, Peg.

12:33.080 --> 12:35.833
I'm toting around 200 ounces
of Mr. Pibb.

12:37.240 --> 12:39.037
Hey, girlie...

12:40.160 --> 12:41.798
...mind if I hit the can?

12:42.000 --> 12:44.389
All right. Lonnie, go with him.

12:44.600 --> 12:47.160
Lonnie, where the hell are you?

12:47.360 --> 12:49.271
Still looking for that Porsche.

12:52.160 --> 12:53.752
Were you back there with Lonnie?

12:53.960 --> 12:56.190
Kelly, are you crazy?

12:56.400 --> 12:58.789
You guys, we were just talking.

12:59.800 --> 13:01.916
We happen to have a lot in common.

13:02.120 --> 13:05.908
We both hate green eggs and ham,
but we think the book is pretty funny.

13:07.200 --> 13:08.235
Now, remember...

13:08.440 --> 13:14.276
...no matter how she threatens us,
do not tell her about the Mercedes.

13:14.480 --> 13:16.471
Hey, what are you whispering about?

13:16.680 --> 13:19.433
We have a Mercedes next door.
Take it, here are the keys.

13:19.640 --> 13:22.234
No, I won't let you.

13:27.920 --> 13:29.478
- Give me the keys.
- No, Starla.

13:29.680 --> 13:32.592
You know, it's not too late
to turn your life around.

13:32.800 --> 13:36.839
So you were gonna blow away
the Bundys. What's that, a $10 fine?

13:37.080 --> 13:39.071
But grand theft auto...

13:39.280 --> 13:40.679
...you're better than that.

13:40.880 --> 13:44.316
Inside you is a confused,
misunderstood person...

13:44.520 --> 13:48.559
...who doesn't need a Mercedes,
just a second chance.

13:48.760 --> 13:51.797
Yeah, I'll think that over
when I'm ditching your car in a lake.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.116
I hope you fry!

13:55.040 --> 13:57.076
There's not enough voltage
in lllinois...

13:57.280 --> 14:00.716
...and I'm gonna shave your head
when they strap you to the hot-

14:02.240 --> 14:05.357
Now, everybody,
down on the floor, now!

14:06.320 --> 14:10.074
Do you know how long it's been
since these floors were washed?

14:12.520 --> 14:14.556
Come on, Lonnie,
we gotta make a break for it.

14:15.280 --> 14:16.235
What's going on?

14:16.440 --> 14:19.989
" Cotton balls" over there handed
over the keys to their Mercedes.

14:21.200 --> 14:22.997
They're wool.

14:25.440 --> 14:27.192
Mercedes.

14:27.400 --> 14:28.628
That's a good idea.

14:28.840 --> 14:30.796
May I suggest you take a hostage
with you?

14:31.000 --> 14:33.116
Perhaps the registered owner
of the car.

14:34.960 --> 14:36.712
That would be her.

14:40.440 --> 14:43.398
Before you go, one thing.
Did you and the girls ever pass time...

14:43.600 --> 14:45.989
...by spanking each other
with licence plates?

14:48.560 --> 14:51.233
Oh, I'm really gonna miss you.

14:56.040 --> 14:59.749
I said cops, not crops.

15:02.400 --> 15:06.188
Is it me, or is that dog really stupid?

15:07.200 --> 15:11.113
Yeah, but, you know,
he's kind of cute.

15:18.720 --> 15:19.994
We're out of here.

15:20.200 --> 15:23.875
- Al, has the movie started?
- Hit the floor, butt head!

15:27.800 --> 15:31.156
Oh, man, I missed the beginning.

15:31.760 --> 15:33.398
Damn.

15:36.160 --> 15:39.118
This 3-D is incredible.

15:39.320 --> 15:42.312
Take off the glasses, Griff.

15:44.560 --> 15:46.869
Sorry, wrong house.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.913
That Negro family,
where do they live? Next door?

15:50.680 --> 15:52.557
Sit down and shut up.

16:02.920 --> 16:06.276
Didn't you see the " Help" sign
I hung out of the bathroom window?

16:06.480 --> 16:10.155
Al, you've been hanging " Help" signs
ever since I've known you.

16:11.520 --> 16:13.431
I'm not really good
at writing letters...

16:13.640 --> 16:16.632
...especially the capital ones...

16:16.840 --> 16:19.752
- ... but for you, I'll do anything-
- Lonnie, move your ass!

16:19.960 --> 16:22.599
I will see you losers in hell.

16:23.120 --> 16:27.511
Super-premium unleaded only,
please.

16:28.280 --> 16:31.750
Jefferson, I feel so violated.

16:32.800 --> 16:33.789
Me too.

16:48.400 --> 16:51.631
- Is everybody okay?
- Yeah, I-

16:51.920 --> 16:53.239
Then get out.

16:58.760 --> 17:02.594
All right, get down and shut up.
Oh, this sucks.

17:02.800 --> 17:05.791
The minute I set foot in this dump,
my life went straight to hell.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.955
So did mine.

17:12.280 --> 17:13.315
Hello?

17:13.520 --> 17:15.431
It's the police.

17:15.640 --> 17:18.598
Yeah, Starla's here,
but she's busy holding us hostage...

17:18.800 --> 17:20.915
...but can I take a message?

17:21.640 --> 17:23.915
- Just give me the phone.
- What?

17:24.119 --> 17:26.349
Hello? This is Bud Bundy.

17:26.560 --> 17:28.550
Yeah, the guy with the dolls.

17:32.600 --> 17:34.352
Now, listen up, pigs.

17:34.560 --> 17:38.155
I want a car to the airport,
I want a plane to Brazil...

17:38.360 --> 17:40.999
...and $50,000 cash.

17:41.200 --> 17:44.033
I demand the same thing.

17:50.760 --> 17:53.354
And I need more Mountain Dew.

17:57.280 --> 18:00.078
Oh, Lord, I've never been in trouble
with the police before.

18:00.280 --> 18:01.269
Yeah, me neither.

18:01.480 --> 18:05.109
Well, except for graduation night
at the academy.

18:06.280 --> 18:09.033
Kelly, there's something
I've been meaning to tell you...

18:09.240 --> 18:11.231
...for several minutes.

18:12.480 --> 18:13.913
You make me feel all funny...

18:14.120 --> 18:17.271
...like my insides turned into
whipped cream.

18:18.120 --> 18:21.999
Well, when I look at you, my-
My legs turn to Jell-O.

18:22.200 --> 18:25.397
You know, whipped cream and Jell-O,
they go real good together.

18:25.600 --> 18:28.319
Oh, you're making me hungry.

18:29.120 --> 18:31.076
<i>Come out with your hands up.</i>

18:31.840 --> 18:34.832
Well, that's it.
I am gonna start offing people.

18:35.040 --> 18:38.476
Then you're gonna have to off me first,
Starla, because we're finished.

18:38.680 --> 18:40.318
I don't want a life of crime.

18:40.520 --> 18:42.476
But you want a life of trash?

18:42.680 --> 18:46.798
If that trash's name is Kelly Bundy,
then yes, ma'am, I do.

18:51.440 --> 18:53.795
I love you, Kelly.

18:57.040 --> 18:59.110
You happy now, Peg?

18:59.320 --> 19:03.199
You drove both our children
into the arms of criminals.

19:03.600 --> 19:07.388
Well, I just wanted them
to do better than I did.

19:08.200 --> 19:09.519
Lonnie...

19:09.720 --> 19:12.598
...I don't usually say this
fully clothed...

19:12.800 --> 19:14.836
...but I love you too.

19:15.920 --> 19:18.195
Oh, well, thank you very much,
blondie.

19:18.400 --> 19:21.756
You made it real easy for me
to decide who's getting it first.

19:21.960 --> 19:22.995
Starla, no!

19:34.680 --> 19:36.716
Al's been hit.

19:36.920 --> 19:38.273
Al, say something.

19:38.480 --> 19:39.549
Get out of the way.

19:39.760 --> 19:41.079
I know CPR.

19:41.280 --> 19:43.510
I'm fine.

19:44.680 --> 19:46.318
I'm fine.

19:46.520 --> 19:48.715
Oh, Al, we thought you were shot.

19:48.920 --> 19:51.275
Well, I was, Peg.

19:51.560 --> 19:56.111
I think my little lucky shoehorn
must have had a little luck left.

20:00.320 --> 20:01.833
All right, we're here.

20:02.040 --> 20:06.875
Sir, please dismount the suspect.

20:09.320 --> 20:10.639
Sir!

20:11.040 --> 20:13.873
- All right.
- Get off!

20:14.120 --> 20:15.633
You saved my life.

20:15.840 --> 20:17.876
Move, Dad!

20:19.360 --> 20:20.839
Hey, Kelly, who's gonna have...

20:21.040 --> 20:24.077
...the imprint of a shoehorn
in his chest the rest of his life?

20:24.280 --> 20:27.670
Daddy, this is no time for riddles,
okay?

20:28.120 --> 20:29.633
Lonnie almost died.

20:29.840 --> 20:30.875
Let's go, dirtbags.

20:31.080 --> 20:32.069
Wait, wait.

20:32.760 --> 20:34.990
Can we still be pen pals?

20:35.400 --> 20:36.958
Oh, what the hell.

20:37.160 --> 20:39.310
Write to me in care of the hole.

20:39.520 --> 20:41.192
Wait, wait!

20:41.400 --> 20:45.279
Kelly, this is not how I dreamt
of this moment.

20:45.920 --> 20:49.117
But neither could I have dreamt
of meeting someone as beautiful...

20:49.320 --> 20:52.392
...and perfect and smart as you.

20:52.800 --> 20:54.438
Kelly Bundy...

20:54.640 --> 20:55.868
...will you marry me?

20:57.680 --> 20:59.636
I thought you'd never ask.

21:02.440 --> 21:04.715
- I'll wait for you.
- I will too, my darling.

21:04.960 --> 21:09.351
No matter whose wife I am in prison,
I'll always be your husband.

21:16.200 --> 21:19.715
That is the sweetest thing
I've ever heard.

21:19.920 --> 21:22.878
Oh, Al, our little girl's
getting married.

21:23.120 --> 21:26.078
Isn't life wonderful?

21:26.600 --> 21:28.670
Damn you.
