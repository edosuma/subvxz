WEBVTT

03:13.802 --> 03:15.716
MARIA: I want you to
go to the hospital.

03:15.847 --> 03:19.676
The doctor will take a pap
smear there and we'll use
it for identification

03:19.808 --> 03:21.069
once we catch him.

03:21.201 --> 03:22.462
LADY: You ain't catching him.

03:24.813 --> 03:27.293
Here's my card.

03:27.424 --> 03:32.211
Call me if you
change your mind,
and you want to add anything.

03:35.171 --> 03:36.519
Detective Maria Quinn.

03:58.194 --> 04:00.543
If you don't smoke,
don't start now.

04:02.329 --> 04:04.330
I'm Vincent Cusak
your new partner.

04:06.158 --> 04:09.944
Maria Quinn. What happened to
Rooney? I was supposed to
meet Rooney here.

04:10.075 --> 04:13.426
Rooney is out on sick leave.
Personal business
he's got to take care of.

04:13.557 --> 04:16.559
Captain thinks it's a good
idea for you and me to be
partners. Captain said.

04:17.518 --> 04:19.736
-First aggravated rape?
-Yeah.

04:20.695 --> 04:25.089
You got through it
without cracking.

04:25.221 --> 04:27.701
And I see you arranged to
be late, so I would have to
interview her alone.

04:27.832 --> 04:28.963
Some kind of test, Cusak?

04:31.140 --> 04:33.272
How did you get
assigned to me, Quinn?

04:33.403 --> 04:35.839
I'm a senior
detective in Mid Manhattan,

04:35.971 --> 04:38.059
arguably the best
dick in New York.

04:38.190 --> 04:39.974
Now that my
partner is retired,

04:40.105 --> 04:43.543
how did someone like you
get assigned to me?

04:43.674 --> 04:45.545
-Providence?
-That kind of providence

04:45.676 --> 04:47.547
comes from being
well connected.

04:47.678 --> 04:49.679
I'm not sleeping
with the commissioner.

04:49.811 --> 04:51.333
Too bad for the commissioner.

04:51.987 --> 04:54.728
Quinn, lace Irish, right?

04:54.859 --> 04:57.818
Long Island, right?
Forest Hills.

04:57.949 --> 05:00.342
Probably went to one of them
fancy Ivy League schools.

05:00.474 --> 05:03.693
Not Dartmouth, Marymount
or anything like that.

05:03.825 --> 05:04.781
Hey,

05:05.348 --> 05:08.219
get off my car!

05:08.351 --> 05:11.092
Get out of here.
Follow your man.

05:11.223 --> 05:12.441
Look at this.

05:16.272 --> 05:19.753
I'd say that takes
some juice, Maria.

05:19.884 --> 05:23.583
Do you have anything more
for me? Because I have
a family dinner.

05:23.714 --> 05:25.019
I'm in favor of families.

05:28.415 --> 05:30.677
PETER: I have to ask
you a good question.
DENNIS: Yes, Peter.

05:30.808 --> 05:33.593
You won't believe this,
they're all asleep.

05:33.724 --> 05:35.638
Good.
Good, good, good, good, good.

05:35.770 --> 05:37.945
Dennis, what you teach?

05:38.076 --> 05:39.686
-Drink, drink...
-Oh, yes.

05:39.817 --> 05:42.210
What you professor of?

05:42.342 --> 05:43.429
DENNIS: Well...

05:43.560 --> 05:46.257
PETER:
Here, here, more food, yes.

05:46.389 --> 05:49.043
Where you meet my
beautiful sister?

05:49.174 --> 05:50.566
MARIA: I audited his class.

05:51.786 --> 05:52.699
Audit.

05:53.831 --> 05:55.223
Like a bookkeeper?

05:55.355 --> 05:56.833
She audited me
like a bookkeeper.

05:58.314 --> 05:59.488
I think I'm drunk.

06:00.055 --> 06:01.055
PETER: Good, good, good, good.

06:03.232 --> 06:05.364
This is the game
Peter plays for dad.

06:05.495 --> 06:07.888
Actually, Peter has
an MBA from Columbia.

06:08.019 --> 06:09.803
Hey, hey, stop please.

06:12.197 --> 06:13.850
I married an immigrant.

06:15.113 --> 06:16.984
Maria married a cop.

06:17.115 --> 06:18.507
Papa, what do you think, papa?

06:20.162 --> 06:21.989
[MARIA'S PAGER BEEPS]

06:22.120 --> 06:27.081
Oh. First day on the job.
I got to call my partner.
Excuse me.

06:28.257 --> 06:30.563
ALL: Maria...

07:06.513 --> 07:08.731
[READING] "My karma
ran over my dogma?"

07:11.387 --> 07:12.474
What the hell does that mean?

07:15.304 --> 07:17.044
Sorry,
I quit, but I hate quitters.

07:18.350 --> 07:21.744
How's the family?
Should be happy,
Dow Jones is up.

07:23.355 --> 07:25.444
Yes, we had money.

07:25.575 --> 07:28.447
Yes, we went to private
schools and had live-in help.
And yes, it all went.

07:28.578 --> 07:31.450
And now I live on my salary,
the same as you do.

07:31.581 --> 07:34.888
So request a different
partner, okay, first thing
tomorrow or I will.

07:35.019 --> 07:37.499
And tonight just
get off my back, okay?

07:37.631 --> 07:41.634
Easy,
easy, I'm the friendliest guy
in my zip code.

07:42.287 --> 07:44.071
I like debutantes, okay?

07:51.645 --> 07:53.907
-Who's in charge here?
-Sergeant is outside.

07:54.038 --> 07:55.909
Line up the witnesses.
Separate them.

07:56.040 --> 07:59.390
Detective Quinn
and I will take their
statements, keep them apart.

07:59.522 --> 08:02.916
If they want to use the
toilet, take them downstairs
to the deli, understand?

08:03.047 --> 08:04.134
-And accompany them.
-Got you.

08:30.988 --> 08:32.554
Where's the victim?

08:32.686 --> 08:34.687
COP: Upstairs in his bedroom.
The name is Carlos Galanter.

08:48.005 --> 08:49.832
Never get out of the boat
while it's rocking.

08:54.272 --> 08:56.012
The victim will still
be dead in the morning.

08:57.580 --> 08:59.233
You said victim.
This is an OD.

09:00.148 --> 09:02.845
Certain things you
learn as a cop, Quinn.

09:03.804 --> 09:07.284
You learn love
doesn't last forever

09:07.416 --> 09:11.724
and you only get
your name in the paper
when you shoot the wrong guy.

09:11.855 --> 09:14.770
And you learn
nobody gets naked
just to shoot heroine.

09:17.165 --> 09:20.646
Tie folded neatly
at the foot of the bed there.
Huhuh.

09:20.777 --> 09:23.257
You got the jones,
you don't take time
to fold you clothes.

09:25.042 --> 09:26.608
No other needle marks.

09:28.045 --> 09:29.263
This is his first hit.

09:31.005 --> 09:33.572
Naked? No?

09:33.703 --> 09:38.098
Somebody wants us to think
it's an OD.

09:38.229 --> 09:43.320
See, unlike other indoor
sports, Quinn you don't got
to be naked to shoot heroine.

09:44.496 --> 09:48.195
What do you think of homocide?
Everything you expected?

09:48.326 --> 09:50.284
Some of the guests
are getting hysterical.

09:50.415 --> 09:53.679
Let them.
I love to see hysterical
rich people.

09:53.810 --> 09:56.551
Yeah, but there's a doctor
who says he has an emergency.

09:56.683 --> 09:58.988
Has to go to
the hospital he says.

09:59.120 --> 10:01.338
Told him he had to
talk to a detective.

10:01.470 --> 10:04.690
Take him to the kitchen.
Detective Quinn
will talk to him.

10:04.821 --> 10:08.345
BRIAN:
When I say do not medicate,
I mean do not medicate.

10:08.477 --> 10:10.173
Do not do anything
until I get there.
Is that understood?

10:10.914 --> 10:12.262
Thank you very much.

10:12.699 --> 10:13.916
Doctor?

10:19.183 --> 10:20.836
You're who I have
been waiting for?

10:20.968 --> 10:22.751
If you'll wait please...

10:22.883 --> 10:24.623
If I wait? I have
a critically ill patient
who is intensive care.

10:24.754 --> 10:26.581
Are you the only
doctor in New York?

10:26.713 --> 10:28.191
At this time,
for this man, yes I am.

10:34.459 --> 10:36.112
Okay.

10:36.244 --> 10:38.332
I'll have one of the officers
escort you through the line.

10:38.463 --> 10:40.639
If you get a chance
while it's fresh in your mind,

10:40.770 --> 10:42.641
write down
everything you remember.
Everything.

10:42.772 --> 10:45.208
-No matter how trivial.
Doctor...
-Venible.

10:45.340 --> 10:46.732
-What hospital?
-Roosevelt.

10:51.172 --> 10:53.129
Detective Quinn,
Miss O'Hara is getting sick.

10:53.261 --> 10:55.392
I want you to escort
her to the bathroom.

10:55.524 --> 10:57.220
Quick. She's the one
who discovered the body.

11:15.500 --> 11:19.765
Thank you.
I hope I never have to do
that or see that.

11:22.420 --> 11:23.899
Want to tell me
about it, Christine?

11:27.425 --> 11:30.819
It's Chrissy.
People call me Chrissy.

11:32.213 --> 11:33.779
Yeah. See,

11:35.303 --> 11:38.261
I went into
the bedroom looking
for the John, you know?

11:39.786 --> 11:41.221
I'm always
looking for the John,

11:44.399 --> 11:47.706
and he was right... Oh God.

11:51.493 --> 11:53.581
How bad is that
cocaine habit, Chrissy?

11:53.713 --> 11:55.235
What do you what are you
going to do? Arrest me just
because I have a runny nose?

12:03.287 --> 12:04.287
Sit down.

12:37.713 --> 12:39.235
I saw you in the ward.
Thank you for staying back.

12:42.152 --> 12:43.631
What did you want
to ask me, Sergeant?

12:43.763 --> 12:47.113
Detective.
It takes a long time
to be a Sergeant.

12:47.244 --> 12:49.768
I'd like to you to tell me
about Carlos Galanter.

12:51.945 --> 12:54.337
One of the guests screamed.
I ran to the bedroom.

12:55.731 --> 12:58.211
He was dead. I called 911.

12:58.342 --> 12:59.473
Did you know what
was in the syringe?

13:01.650 --> 13:03.694
It's six in the morning,
can't this wait?

13:03.826 --> 13:06.915
The first twenty four hours
of the police investigation
are the golden hours.

13:07.047 --> 13:09.657
After that, witnesses forget
evidence and it's lost.

13:09.789 --> 13:12.660
So you do as much as possible
in the first
twenty four hours.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.750
That's why I'm here now.

13:15.882 --> 13:19.275
As a professional, do you
think the overdose was
self administered?

13:19.407 --> 13:21.800
That's your profession,
not mine.

13:21.931 --> 13:24.280
And as much as I
enjoy discussing
forensic medicine with you,

13:26.936 --> 13:30.504
I have to shower.
I have surgery
in an hour and a half.

13:31.680 --> 13:34.638
Exactly what did you see
when you went in the bedroom?

13:34.770 --> 13:39.774
I saw the body, exactly.
No pulse, no respiration

13:39.906 --> 13:44.126
Eyes open, pupils dilated.
I administered C.P.R.
He was gone.

13:46.216 --> 13:48.609
Haven't I seen you somewhere?

13:48.740 --> 13:50.524
Did you see
anyone enter or leave
the bedroom

13:50.655 --> 13:52.613
other than
the woman who found him?

13:52.744 --> 13:56.747
Lincoln Center at concerts.
I've seen you at
concerts at Lincoln Center.

13:56.879 --> 13:58.793
Yes, I have season tickets.

13:58.925 --> 14:01.491
Yes, so do I.
See, I am observant.

14:01.623 --> 14:04.320
And no, I didn't see
anyone under the bed.

14:04.452 --> 14:05.582
Did you come to
the party alone?

14:08.760 --> 14:10.718
Yes.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.502
And I don't believe it was
self administered.

14:12.634 --> 14:13.590
People don't kill
them themselves that way.

14:35.657 --> 14:38.833
Guys, this is Maria Quinn, my
new partner Maria.

14:38.965 --> 14:41.749
This is Levy,
Washington, Knowles,

14:41.881 --> 14:44.970
Micelli and
Watson from homicide.

14:45.101 --> 14:47.102
They are going to assist us
in following up on witnesses.

14:50.063 --> 14:52.455
Hey, are you going to smoke
that at eight o'clock
in the morning?

14:52.587 --> 14:54.980
No,
I'm going to wait until 8:15.

14:55.111 --> 14:58.766
I got them to do
the autopsy last night.

14:58.898 --> 15:03.292
Confirms heart
failure due to overdose
of... Get this, guys,

15:03.424 --> 15:07.601
one hundred percent heroine.

15:07.732 --> 15:12.867
Bruises on the victim's chest
indicate he was held down
while being administered.

15:12.999 --> 15:15.696
Which means, whoever held him
down, was really strong or
really really friendly

15:15.827 --> 15:17.045
if you catch my drift.

15:17.655 --> 15:19.787
What is this?

15:19.919 --> 15:23.225
Jackson Pollack, I think.
Very rare and expensive.

15:23.357 --> 15:24.661
Looks like
somebody threw up on it.

15:26.273 --> 15:27.969
Also,

15:28.101 --> 15:32.800
signs of recent beating,
severe and professional,

15:32.932 --> 15:35.237
so we know
the guy had enemies.

15:35.369 --> 15:37.239
I think the first
thing we want to do

15:37.371 --> 15:40.634
is run Carlos and
the rest of the witnesses
through the computer.

15:42.245 --> 15:43.115
Here.

15:44.465 --> 15:45.552
Where did you get this?

15:45.683 --> 15:47.423
I have access to
the computer at home.

15:47.990 --> 15:49.817
You have what?

15:49.949 --> 15:52.689
When I worked
investigative analysis
they gave me home access.

15:56.259 --> 15:57.825
Carlos Galanter.

15:57.957 --> 16:01.394
Possession, possession
with intent to sell,

16:01.525 --> 16:06.312
assault, aggravated assault,
prostitution,
bribery, extortion

16:06.443 --> 16:08.096
a varied and
colorful career, huh?

16:11.579 --> 16:14.755
Okay. Seven names here known
to Narco. NOCU.

16:14.886 --> 16:17.584
Quinn and I will
take those seven,
and you guys

16:17.715 --> 16:21.370
divide up the rest.
Quinn and I took
statements last night,

16:21.502 --> 16:22.458
but I want a follow-through.

16:22.851 --> 16:24.808
And, guys,

16:24.940 --> 16:28.290
these are rich and
famous and connected,

16:28.422 --> 16:31.032
so insult them
only a little more
than necessary.

16:33.993 --> 16:34.644
We should also
talk to the girl
who discovered the body.

16:46.744 --> 16:48.484
Here we are.
Christine O'Hara, 201.

16:50.270 --> 16:55.013
Christine said that she went
to Carlos's bedroom
to use the bathroom.

16:55.144 --> 16:59.060
You think she
went in to practice
heavy breathing a little,

16:59.192 --> 17:01.454
and she said,
"Here try this for
a bigger thrill."

17:01.585 --> 17:03.543
And popped main
line with pure smack?

17:03.674 --> 17:05.284
That's what you think?

17:05.415 --> 17:09.592
You got a dirty
and suspicious mind, Quinn.
I love that.

17:12.944 --> 17:14.032
Police!

17:19.821 --> 17:21.909
We're supposed to call a judge
and get a warrant.

17:22.041 --> 17:25.565
-Warrants are for sissys.
-You can't just walk in.

17:25.696 --> 17:29.003
You want to play by the rules?
The rules don't work, Quinn.

17:29.135 --> 17:30.700
The rules are not
acceptable here.

17:34.053 --> 17:38.360
Well, as my former partner
used to say, nothing like a
little B &amp; E to start the day.

17:42.061 --> 17:44.062
-What are you doing?
-Just thought I would try it.

17:46.587 --> 17:48.414
If that key fits,
you could make me a copy.

17:49.546 --> 17:51.199
I'm just kidding.

18:45.428 --> 18:50.824
She came from Iowa or Indiana
one of those states
that begin with an I.

18:50.955 --> 18:54.436
Here's a picture of Chrissy
and Carlos Galanter in Mexico.

19:06.493 --> 19:09.016
No names just initials,

19:09.148 --> 19:13.803
codes, extensions, businesses.

19:13.935 --> 19:15.892
-What the hell is this?
-MARIA: Chrissy?

19:17.243 --> 19:21.942
We're here to ask
you some questions
about Carlos Galanter.

19:22.073 --> 19:24.249
What are you doing here?
Do you have a search warrant?

19:24.380 --> 19:27.339
It would take us about five
minutes to get one,
Miss O'Hara.

19:27.470 --> 19:28.296
Then you get one.

19:29.037 --> 19:30.342
Get out!

19:30.865 --> 19:33.519
Get out of here!

19:33.650 --> 19:35.260
I'm calling my lawyer
and see what he has to say!

19:35.391 --> 19:40.134
We could arrest you
on prostitution,
possession, trafficking.

19:40.266 --> 19:43.137
Call your lawyer, because
we're going to charge you with
withholding evidence

19:43.269 --> 19:45.487
lying to a police officer,
and accessory to murder.

20:01.156 --> 20:05.899
What we want to talk about is
Carlos and about Mexico
and drug trafficking.

20:08.729 --> 20:09.859
We just went on vacation.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.864
I don't know anything
about drug trafficking.

20:17.651 --> 20:18.955
How long have you been a call
girl, Chrissy?

20:21.176 --> 20:22.394
Long enough.

20:24.658 --> 20:25.875
Talk to me.

20:27.835 --> 20:32.099
I'm calling my lawyer. We'll
see what he has to say about
someone busting in.

20:32.231 --> 20:36.886
Hey, hey, that's not
necessary, Christine.

20:37.018 --> 20:40.977
We have all we need to know.
If we need anything else,
we'll call you.

20:41.109 --> 20:41.891
Is that all right with you?

20:52.729 --> 20:54.774
VINCENT: You have access?

20:54.905 --> 20:56.732
Nobody gives nobody anything.

20:58.082 --> 21:00.780
Where's your juice, Quinn?

21:00.911 --> 21:03.043
I was married to a cop
who was killed on the job.

21:03.174 --> 21:05.437
The brass gives
me anything I want.

21:05.568 --> 21:08.701
So what do you want?
Getting even for
your husband's death?

21:08.832 --> 21:11.269
That is why you became a cop?

21:11.400 --> 21:13.706
C'mon, Quinn,
women like you aren't cops.

21:13.837 --> 21:16.186
Women like you
spend their lives

21:16.318 --> 21:20.800
buying antiques, shopping.
You ain't no cop.
Look in the mirror.

21:21.497 --> 21:24.325
What's the real story, Quinn?

21:24.457 --> 21:26.675
You're the best
cop in Manhattan,
you figure it out.

21:51.962 --> 21:55.791
This is Arty,
my former partner.
This is Maria Quinn.

21:58.055 --> 22:00.361
-I'm sorry about the desk.
-It's okay.

22:00.493 --> 22:03.625
You got to understand, Maria,
Cusak and Arty are legends.

22:09.284 --> 22:11.067
Always nice to meet a legend.

22:11.199 --> 22:15.681
I'll come by once in a while.
That was my desk
for twenty years.

22:15.812 --> 22:17.726
Your husband was Eddie. I was
at the funeral.

22:19.381 --> 22:21.295
I'm sorry I don't remember.

22:21.427 --> 22:24.864
I dropped by your home.
We did task force together.

22:26.432 --> 22:32.045
You want to check
Galanter's phone records,
bank accounts,

22:32.176 --> 22:35.744
credit card records,
income tax forms
and look for Columbians.

22:36.833 --> 22:39.182
Excuse me,
are you still on the job?

22:39.314 --> 22:42.360
VINCENT:
Maria, Arty and I talk.

22:42.491 --> 22:44.666
We're partners,
like old married couples.

22:44.798 --> 22:47.190
They talk every
night before they sleep.

22:47.322 --> 22:49.454
I'm not trying to
take your job, Maria.

22:49.585 --> 22:53.109
I just get,
tired of looking at
the sports channel all day.

22:53.241 --> 22:54.459
I miss the action, you know?

22:56.287 --> 22:57.636
What do Columbians
have to do with it?

22:59.856 --> 23:04.512
The great Seattle
windshield pit epidemic.

23:06.776 --> 23:09.038
See, a few years
ago people in Seattle

23:10.345 --> 23:12.738
thought
the windshields on their cars
were being

23:14.784 --> 23:17.395
pitted by some
mysterious force.

23:17.526 --> 23:23.357
Cosmic rays, laser beams,
little green men.

23:23.489 --> 23:28.493
Hundreds, hell, thousands of
them reporting mysterious
pits in their windshield.

23:29.886 --> 23:30.712
When they investigated,

23:32.846 --> 23:35.717
what they found out was
that as the word spread,

23:35.849 --> 23:39.634
people started
looking at their windshields

23:39.766 --> 23:41.680
instead of through them.

23:46.337 --> 23:48.730
There's probably some
point to this story.

23:50.124 --> 23:52.212
One hundred percent heroine,

23:52.343 --> 23:55.215
Columbians love to trade
cocaine for pure heroine.

23:56.347 --> 23:59.393
It's easier to transport
and more money in it.

23:59.525 --> 24:02.178
A year ago there
was a big rip-off

24:02.310 --> 24:04.006
at the Liberty
Motel in Queens.

24:04.138 --> 24:05.660
No, that was...

24:05.792 --> 24:09.751
No, no.
The guy you want to talk to
is Tyrone.

24:17.020 --> 24:21.502
-How can I help you?
-I want to
apologize for this morning.

24:21.634 --> 24:25.985
When I lose a patient...
Well,
I was rude and I'm sorry.

24:26.116 --> 24:29.423
Believe me,
that's fine, doctor.
Don't worry about it.

24:29.555 --> 24:34.994
By way of amends, I have
two tickets for the Met
tonight, La Boheme.

24:35.125 --> 24:37.213
And I thought you
might like to use
the other ticket.

24:37.345 --> 24:38.780
I don't want to sound like...

24:43.917 --> 24:45.308
it promises to be
a really special evening.

24:45.440 --> 24:47.049
And I hate to see
the other ticket
go to waste.

24:50.358 --> 24:52.141
Besides, I owe you an apology.

24:52.273 --> 24:54.143
No, you don't, really.

24:54.275 --> 24:58.278
I'm not asking for a date
that's not true.

24:58.409 --> 25:01.977
I am asking for a date.
I'm asking you for a date.

25:02.109 --> 25:04.632
I don't mean to sound
unappreciative, but...

25:04.764 --> 25:06.547
BRIAN:   So why don't you just
think it over...

25:06.679 --> 25:09.332
I'll have the ticket with me
and I'll be at the fountain.

25:09.464 --> 25:11.987
You know where that is?

25:12.119 --> 25:13.728
Well, I don't finish here
until at least seven.

25:16.427 --> 25:18.341
That's okay.
I'll leave it at will call.

25:18.473 --> 25:20.692
It will be under my name.
Try to make it, please.

25:21.476 --> 25:22.520
Please?

25:23.478 --> 25:24.826
I'll try.

25:33.314 --> 25:35.097
It's okay. I enjoyed it.

25:35.229 --> 25:37.186
The heaviest
breathing I get nowadays

25:37.318 --> 25:40.276
is when the old
lady comes home
from aerobic sclass.

25:40.408 --> 25:42.888
You know, Vinny, you're no
t nearly as amusing as
you think you are.

25:43.846 --> 25:44.846
I could be.

25:51.027 --> 25:52.985
[OPERA SOUNDS]

26:11.526 --> 26:12.744
Excuse me.

26:21.188 --> 26:22.449
You look beautiful.

26:22.581 --> 26:23.668
Please.

26:31.241 --> 26:32.590
You do, you look beautiful.

27:21.770 --> 27:25.207
VINCENT:
Tyrone hangs in this ally.
There he is!

27:30.518 --> 27:32.345
Watch the car, don't scratch
the paint.

28:13.387 --> 28:15.344
What are you
trying to do, Tyrone,

28:15.476 --> 28:16.476
give me a heart attack?

28:16.607 --> 28:18.783
I didn't recognize you, Mr.
Cusak.

28:18.914 --> 28:20.959
When the man starts
chasing you, you run.

28:21.090 --> 28:23.352
How is your mother, Tyrone?

28:23.484 --> 28:26.094
She's been on
a new medicine, man,
but she hurts all the time,

28:26.226 --> 28:28.140
you know what I mean?

28:28.271 --> 28:30.142
Hey, Mr. Cusak
that's your new partner?

28:30.273 --> 28:32.927
Slick.
What happened to Mr. Arty.

28:33.059 --> 28:34.189
Tyrone, shut the hell up.

28:34.321 --> 28:37.149
Okay, okay.

28:37.280 --> 28:40.369
There was
a ripoff about a year ago
in Queens Liberty Motel.

28:40.501 --> 28:42.110
Tell me about it.

28:42.242 --> 28:47.028
Heavy Columbians in town for
part of industrial smack, man.

28:47.160 --> 28:49.988
These guys rip them off
and blew them away.

28:50.119 --> 28:52.077
There was brains
all over the place.

28:52.208 --> 28:54.166
What are you looking at?
Get the hell out of here!

28:54.297 --> 28:56.211
Police brutality!
Police brutality!

28:56.343 --> 28:57.604
Get off me, man!

28:57.736 --> 28:59.649
Somebody help me, man!

28:59.781 --> 29:03.436
I don't know, man.
I don't know.

29:03.567 --> 29:06.221
What dudes?
Or I'll take you down
to the Met Center, Tyrone,

29:06.353 --> 29:08.571
and test you for you for real.
What dudes?

29:08.703 --> 29:12.619
Lysander O'Hara,
a real righteous maniac.

29:12.751 --> 29:16.405
He's so crazy he
would sell you anything
that would make you go crazy.

29:16.537 --> 29:20.453
-I can't breathe, man!
-Get the hell out of here!

29:20.584 --> 29:23.238
Hey, man,
this man will kill people
for two dollars.

29:23.370 --> 29:24.936
Where's Lysander?

29:25.067 --> 29:27.199
Uptown on some charge.

29:28.810 --> 29:30.071
Hey,
can you get me tickets Mr.

29:30.203 --> 29:34.467
If I catch you again, you're
going in for good.

29:34.598 --> 29:39.298
-I got Yankee tickets.
-Police brutality.
Get off me, man.

29:39.429 --> 29:42.605
Yankees suck, man.
Hey, why don't you
take care of that knee.

29:42.737 --> 29:44.346
Nice to meet you, ma'am.

29:44.478 --> 29:46.392
Get off me, man!
Let go of my jacket!

29:47.524 --> 29:49.003
You going to pay me?

29:49.135 --> 29:51.832
Lysander is a real heavy dude,

29:51.964 --> 29:53.138
but he's dumb,
you know what I mean?

29:53.269 --> 29:56.445
He's got a wife, blond
hair all over the place.

29:57.317 --> 29:58.273
Whoa.

29:59.493 --> 30:01.407
Blonde?

30:01.538 --> 30:03.452
Lysander O'Hara,
arresting officers?

30:07.849 --> 30:09.284
MARIA: I'm sorry.
Can I put you on hold?

30:10.678 --> 30:12.287
Quinn.

30:15.770 --> 30:16.814
I'm sure I could.

30:18.425 --> 30:20.513
I'll find out.

30:20.644 --> 30:22.950
Vinny,
we're not working tonight,
are we, captain?

30:25.475 --> 30:27.825
Yes. Eight o'clock, sure.

30:31.481 --> 30:34.309
Okay. I have someone on hold
so I'll get back to you.

30:35.224 --> 30:36.094
Thank you.

30:37.357 --> 30:38.270
I'm sorry.

30:39.925 --> 30:41.360
What date did
they try the case?

30:43.754 --> 30:45.364
Could you fax me
the court records?

30:45.887 --> 30:48.062
Right. Thank you.

30:52.807 --> 30:58.986
Lysander O'Hara. Attempted
murder, assault,
assault with intent to kill,

30:59.118 --> 31:02.337
serving time for possession.
Know what drug he sold?

31:02.469 --> 31:04.296
One hundred percent heroine.

31:04.427 --> 31:06.994
Guess who turned state's
evidence and sent
Lysander to the joint?

31:07.561 --> 31:08.561
Carlos Galanter.

31:10.869 --> 31:13.392
No wonder you're the best
detective in America.

31:13.523 --> 31:16.525
Want to know what else?
That was Danny I
was just talking to,

31:16.657 --> 31:18.745
the assistant warden,
looked up the visitors log

31:18.877 --> 31:24.838
and Christine O'Hara,
Mrs. Lysander, visited him
twice a month and guess what?

31:24.970 --> 31:27.058
Lysander was
paroled last month.

31:28.234 --> 31:30.800
So, what case do we
solve after lunch?

31:30.932 --> 31:32.890
After lunch?
We go visit Chrissy again.

31:33.021 --> 31:34.369
Want to try
the deli down the street?

31:34.501 --> 31:36.197
Sorry I've got
something to do.
Thanks anyway.

31:47.775 --> 31:49.515
Could we have another
mineral water please?

31:49.646 --> 31:51.604
-White wine please.
-White wine, what?

31:53.781 --> 31:56.522
Why not?
Want a refund on your taxes.

31:56.653 --> 31:59.481
No, no, just asking.

32:00.875 --> 32:02.441
Bad day at work, dear?

32:03.878 --> 32:05.923
You might say so.

32:06.054 --> 32:10.231
Haven't you ever had a bad
day teaching and had to answer
stupid questions?

32:13.714 --> 32:15.367
On second thought, I'll have a
glass of wine too.

32:15.498 --> 32:16.934
Could you make that
two glasses of wine?

32:18.066 --> 32:20.372
So, what did you
want to talk about?

32:20.503 --> 32:22.243
Talk about?

32:22.375 --> 32:24.767
Yes. Yesterday you
said you wanted to talk.

32:24.899 --> 32:27.509
Something people often do
when they're
having lunch together.

32:31.906 --> 32:32.950
Talk about us.

32:34.387 --> 32:35.909
You and me.

32:36.041 --> 32:38.607
Yes, you and me. That's us.

32:43.831 --> 32:47.268
I think that we
should take a break.

32:50.925 --> 32:52.273
Take a break?

32:55.451 --> 32:57.670
This hasn't exactly been
a high speed express.

32:58.933 --> 33:01.456
Taking a break

33:01.588 --> 33:03.458
is like jumping train
without having to run.

33:07.028 --> 33:08.463
Then I guess
there's no problem.

33:12.338 --> 33:16.080
I guess a relationship is what
happens when you're waiting
for something better.

33:18.953 --> 33:21.215
You're a good friend.

33:21.347 --> 33:22.564
What is friendship basically?

33:23.827 --> 33:26.003
No, it isn't basically.

33:37.972 --> 33:41.409
Arty used to say
the three best things
in the world

33:41.541 --> 33:44.195
are martinis before
and a nap after it.

33:45.762 --> 33:50.505
So, Vinny, if Arthur
loved the job so much,
why did he retire?

33:50.637 --> 33:52.464
They retired him.

33:52.595 --> 33:56.337
Best cop in New York City,
now he stays home
all day and watches

33:56.469 --> 33:57.817
lawn bowling on cable.

34:00.603 --> 34:02.474
She must have left
right after we did.

34:03.780 --> 34:05.216
The place looks the same.

34:05.826 --> 34:07.435
Where the hell is she?

34:13.964 --> 34:16.531
-Something is bothering me.
-What?

34:16.663 --> 34:19.056
When we interviewed Chrissy at
Carlos's, she was wearing
a designer gown

34:19.187 --> 34:20.970
that cost several
thousand dollars.

34:21.102 --> 34:23.495
Had on a Cartier bracelet,
five figures,

34:23.626 --> 34:24.844
none of those things are here.

34:24.975 --> 34:26.715
Nothing dressy in the closet.

34:26.847 --> 34:28.456
The makeup in on
the dresser is minimal.

34:28.588 --> 34:30.241
Borrowed?

34:30.372 --> 34:31.938
Don't you get it?

34:32.070 --> 34:35.724
Get what?
I get very testy when someone
accuses me

34:35.856 --> 34:38.988
of not getting something
the rest of the world gets.

34:39.120 --> 34:41.600
Look, her things are here
because this is
where she lives,

34:41.731 --> 34:43.863
but she works someplace else.

34:43.994 --> 34:46.126
Lots of call girls
use an apartment.

34:46.258 --> 34:52.176
Fine. We will search all the
apartments in midtown for
a Cartier bracelet; okay?

34:52.307 --> 34:54.787
We got to get a bulletin out
on Lysander and Chrissy.

34:54.918 --> 34:57.790
Then we will cross reference
these numbers in this book

34:57.921 --> 34:59.792
with the party list.

34:59.923 --> 35:02.838
That might narrow
down the suspects
to three or four thousand.

35:02.970 --> 35:05.711
That's what I'll
be doing tonight,
protecting and serving.

35:05.842 --> 35:09.584
You, I presume
will be staying home
watching public television.

35:09.716 --> 35:11.412
Am I wrong? Am I wrong?

35:11.892 --> 35:13.327
Am I wrong?

35:15.983 --> 35:18.506
BRIAN: In the 19th century
before anesthesia

35:18.638 --> 35:20.465
Speed was
the most important thing.

35:20.596 --> 35:24.556
A doctor could amputate a leg
in two minutes flat.

35:24.687 --> 35:26.166
As a matter of fact,
in one story,

35:26.298 --> 35:29.038
he amputated on patients
in under two minutes.

35:29.170 --> 35:31.519
Of course the patient died
afterwards from gangreen,

35:31.651 --> 35:32.825
they usually
did in those days.

35:33.827 --> 35:36.524
In fact,
during that same operation

35:36.656 --> 35:37.482
the doctor listed

35:39.659 --> 35:41.660
amputated
the fingers of his assistant,

35:41.791 --> 35:44.880
who also died of gangreen
poisoning later on.

35:45.012 --> 35:48.406
He was so
animated with his scalpel
and slashed the coattails

35:48.537 --> 35:50.886
of a very
distinguished spectator,

35:51.018 --> 35:54.281
who was so terrified,
that he dropped
dead from fright.

35:54.413 --> 35:57.328
It was the only operation in
history with a three
hundred percent mortality.

36:00.680 --> 36:03.464
MARIA: Tennis lessons,
dance lessons,
piano lessons,

36:04.074 --> 36:06.075
the right schools,

36:06.207 --> 36:09.992
the right people, the right
clothes. I was
the princess on a pedestal,

36:10.124 --> 36:12.343
but I wanted more out of life.

36:12.866 --> 36:14.997
Thank you.

36:15.129 --> 36:19.915
So I quit school and went to
New York and I auditioned
for a Broadway show

36:20.047 --> 36:23.876
and guess what?
I made the chorus line.

36:24.007 --> 36:25.965
And I was nineteen
and I was working
on Broadway.

36:27.707 --> 36:28.924
I was real naive at that time.

36:32.668 --> 36:34.713
What about after that?

36:34.844 --> 36:38.847
Then I broke my ankle
and I couldn't dance.
And I met a boy who was a cop.

36:38.979 --> 36:40.849
-And you married him?
-Yeah, I married him.

36:44.985 --> 36:46.681
What happened to him?

36:48.075 --> 36:48.944
He was killed.

37:16.843 --> 37:18.235
You live here alone?

37:18.366 --> 37:20.324
No, the Harvard football team
spends the night.

37:21.848 --> 37:23.109
Well, I don't mean now.

37:23.241 --> 37:25.720
No, just the marching band.

37:25.852 --> 37:28.723
Well, then play
something romantic here.

38:07.720 --> 38:08.633
I'm sorry.

38:12.855 --> 38:13.768
Maria...

39:15.353 --> 39:17.092
Can I borrow one
of your shirts?

39:17.224 --> 39:19.573
-What?
-One of your shirts.

39:20.445 --> 39:23.925
Sure.
Right there in the amoire.

39:31.847 --> 39:33.805
Why do you want a shirt for?
Are you going somewhere?

39:34.807 --> 39:35.894
I'm shy.

40:18.764 --> 40:21.461
VENIBLE'S VOICE:
You look beautiful.
You do, you look beautiful.

40:21.593 --> 40:26.205
I'm not asking you for a date
that's not true.
I am asking you for a date.

40:26.336 --> 40:29.208
I'm asking you for a date,
you are who I've
been waiting for...

40:45.660 --> 40:49.097
VINCENT'S VOICE:   Answer your
phone, Quinn. What?
You think you deserve a life?

40:49.229 --> 40:53.537
Meet me at 126
Jones Street off Third.

40:53.668 --> 40:56.104
Now I know why
no one has heard
from Chrissy O'Hara.

40:59.065 --> 41:01.936
-Detective Quinn.
-COP: What happened to Arty?

41:02.068 --> 41:03.634
Up the stairs and
through the tunnel.

41:17.083 --> 41:18.692
VINCENT: Raped?

41:18.824 --> 41:20.564
CORONOR:
Well, preliminary inspection
shows no semen

41:22.218 --> 41:23.784
Bruising not
consistent from rape.

41:27.485 --> 41:32.706
She was moved.
Folded over probably
in the trunk of a car.

41:32.838 --> 41:33.968
What do you think? Two hours?

42:07.655 --> 42:09.656
It doesn't bother so
much after a while.

42:12.312 --> 42:14.966
Not that you don't care
or you get used to it ever,

42:20.494 --> 42:22.843
but it doesn't
bother you so much later.

42:25.368 --> 42:29.023
Here's the xerox
of her phone book.

42:29.155 --> 42:33.114
There are five names
here from her phone
book to match the party list.

42:33.246 --> 42:35.073
I'm having task force do that,

42:35.204 --> 42:36.857
but this one here, see B.R.

42:39.687 --> 42:42.297
B.R. Mario's pizza
parlor on Mott Street.

42:44.431 --> 42:45.431
She likes pizza.

42:45.563 --> 42:47.433
I know Mario's pizza parlor.

42:47.565 --> 42:50.262
Every cop in
the organized crime unit
knows Mario's pizza parlor.

42:50.393 --> 42:53.134
Most importantly,
my ex-partner
knows it very well.

42:53.266 --> 42:55.223
VINCENT:
So we'll stop at Mario's,

42:55.355 --> 42:57.878
get some calzone
and maybe some answers.

43:30.303 --> 43:34.349
A ride in a New York cab
can get your spine
realigned for free.

43:34.481 --> 43:35.960
How you doing?
Good to see you, Maria.

43:37.571 --> 43:39.616
Oh, Vinny, you look like hell.

43:42.271 --> 43:43.620
I got something to show you.
Look at this.

43:45.535 --> 43:47.406
B.R. Mario's pizza parlor.

43:49.496 --> 43:52.629
Benny Rosen is scum,
but he ain't no killer.

43:54.501 --> 43:56.154
Vinny, what are you doing?
Growing a beard?

43:56.285 --> 43:57.851
You look like a narc.

43:59.680 --> 44:00.941
Shall we?

44:23.182 --> 44:25.662
-Sit down, sit down.
-I am just
having a pizza here.

44:27.273 --> 44:28.142
What do you want?

44:39.154 --> 44:39.980
Carlos Galanter.

44:42.549 --> 44:44.115
Lysander O'Hara.

44:45.683 --> 44:47.335
And Christine O'Hara.

44:47.467 --> 44:49.294
I can answer that one.

44:49.425 --> 44:50.991
The back of
a Chevy down by the bay.

44:54.561 --> 44:56.823
C'mon - you spilled all
over my suit.

44:58.478 --> 45:01.393
Stop jerking around
or are we going to
have to dance on your neck.

45:01.524 --> 45:04.526
Hey, hey, come on.

45:04.658 --> 45:06.180
-What do you want?
-I'll tell you what I want.

45:07.617 --> 45:09.314
Tell me about Lysander O'Hara.

45:13.232 --> 45:15.320
The guy is a flat-out killer.

45:15.451 --> 45:17.626
He used to
muscle for Galanter;
all right?

45:17.758 --> 45:20.891
This guy is on mean
street for anybody.

45:22.154 --> 45:25.373
I'm telling you, he's crazy.
He enjoys killing.

45:27.594 --> 45:29.726
C'mon,
you didn't hear it from me.

45:29.857 --> 45:34.165
Word is he iced
a couple of Columbians
at Liberty Motel.

45:34.296 --> 45:36.776
Now, do yourself
and the city a favor,
if you see him,

45:36.908 --> 45:39.083
plant six into him real quick
and good day.

45:40.215 --> 45:41.172
ARTY: Sit down.

45:41.303 --> 45:42.260
Christine O'Hara.

45:43.044 --> 45:44.566
-His wife, I think.
-Yeah?

45:44.698 --> 45:46.438
Chisling little whore,

45:46.569 --> 45:51.878
snow bird, put fist
fulls up her head
like it had a leak.

45:52.924 --> 45:56.274
What a set of
blond hair on this kid

45:56.405 --> 45:57.492
not bleached I might add.

45:58.581 --> 46:01.235
I carried her
a while on the books.

46:01.367 --> 46:03.237
You carried her a little while
on the books?

46:03.369 --> 46:05.065
You wouldn't even carry your
mother on the books.
Who are you kidding?

46:05.197 --> 46:07.372
This is different. See,

46:07.503 --> 46:10.767
she paid the best
way she knew how.

46:13.074 --> 46:13.987
I'm only human.

46:15.555 --> 46:16.947
You're slime, you're scum.

46:19.211 --> 46:20.864
Get him out of here!

46:24.477 --> 46:25.303
Get him out of here!

46:28.394 --> 46:29.394
Brotherly love.

46:33.703 --> 46:36.836
MARIA: Benny, talk to me.

46:36.968 --> 46:39.404
BENNY: Sure, just take him
for a walk or something.

46:41.102 --> 46:41.972
Talk to me.

46:42.538 --> 46:43.712
Yeah, sure.

46:43.844 --> 46:48.326
Why are you guys busting
my chops for

46:48.457 --> 46:51.155
some ripoff artist, some
whacked out crack hit, and
some chiseling little whore.

46:51.809 --> 46:53.418
How much was Chrissy in for?

46:55.508 --> 46:57.117
Ten grand. It's all paid up.

46:57.249 --> 46:59.250
How? When?

46:59.381 --> 47:00.686
Three months ago,
some paluka helped her,

47:00.818 --> 47:03.123
she paid up the principal
the whole shebang and all.

47:03.777 --> 47:05.560
What was his name?

47:05.692 --> 47:09.173
C'mon, I don't take names.
What do you take
me for city bank?

47:09.304 --> 47:11.479
One guy ruins my suit,

47:11.611 --> 47:14.743
the other one plays king kong
on my face, now you're asking
me for receipts.

47:14.875 --> 47:16.484
You're going to
drive me legit.

47:16.616 --> 47:18.356
Ever see this guy?

47:18.487 --> 47:20.532
No, I never met him.
I just dealt with her.

47:20.663 --> 47:24.275
She paid me in cash. I always
used to meet her at Gate's at
the Embassy Hotel.

47:40.814 --> 47:42.336
We're all set for 6:30

47:42.468 --> 47:43.337
Proprietor please.

47:47.299 --> 47:50.214
Lady, this is a private club.
It's males only.

47:50.345 --> 47:52.129
It's not a chauvinistic thing.

47:52.260 --> 47:54.740
It's also a high
class whorehouse.
I'm with vice busting unit.

47:54.872 --> 47:56.307
Give me the proprietor,
please.

48:10.539 --> 48:11.844
Christine O'Hara.

48:11.976 --> 48:14.412
You're not in vice.
I know everybody in vice.

48:14.543 --> 48:17.545
Christine O'Hara.

48:17.677 --> 48:20.070
There's no one out by
the pool, why don't we go
out there and talk?

48:27.643 --> 48:31.298
Yes, Chrissy. Chrissy
wasn't a fulltime girl.

48:31.430 --> 48:34.562
Worked weekends, parties.

48:34.694 --> 48:37.130
Could have been very
successful, but the life
really wasn't for her.

48:37.697 --> 48:39.393
a talented amateur.

48:39.525 --> 48:41.134
When was the last
time you saw Chrissy?

48:42.310 --> 48:46.835
She met some guy right after
she got busted and quit.

48:46.967 --> 48:50.143
Got straight,
I haven't seen her since.

48:50.275 --> 48:51.231
When did she get busted?

48:53.452 --> 48:55.409
-September, August.
-Here?

48:55.889 --> 48:57.411
No, no,

48:59.414 --> 49:00.980
it was an outcall job.

49:03.027 --> 49:06.029
What name was
she arrested under?

49:06.160 --> 49:08.640
You got me, but I might be
able to help you with that.
Come here.

49:08.771 --> 49:10.294
Let me just look at this.

49:10.686 --> 49:11.686
Let's see.

49:15.648 --> 49:20.695
Chrissy?
Thereare her working names.
Maybe that will help you.

49:20.827 --> 49:24.873
This address on
Seventy first Street.
How current is it?

49:25.005 --> 49:30.662
It was good in August.
I called her in August,
and she turned me down.

49:30.793 --> 49:34.883
Tell me, do you have any idea
who this someone was who
got Chrissy straight?

49:35.015 --> 49:37.364
Some trick with
a missionary complex,

49:37.496 --> 49:39.540
saving hookers is
their advocation.

50:09.615 --> 50:12.008
Why is it always
on the top floor?

50:19.320 --> 50:20.364
Wait a minute.

50:21.192 --> 50:22.757
You carry that
around with you?

50:23.716 --> 50:24.803
A hunch.

50:26.806 --> 50:28.067
Good hunch.

51:24.864 --> 51:27.083
She was standing here.

51:30.174 --> 51:33.654
He held the gun
here like that.

51:41.707 --> 51:43.142
Put her on the bed.

51:50.498 --> 51:51.585
An execution.

51:59.812 --> 52:01.595
What are you doing?

52:01.727 --> 52:03.597
There's a hair here.
We can put it through DNA.

52:03.729 --> 52:06.122
What will it prove?
The girl was a hooker.

52:06.253 --> 52:09.168
She had more traffic than the
Holland Tunnel. Use your head

52:21.268 --> 52:22.747
He would have had to wash up.

53:36.082 --> 53:37.778
Detective Quinn.

53:37.910 --> 53:39.258
-The doctor will
see you in a minute.
-I'm not a patient.

53:39.390 --> 53:41.565
-Sit down, please.
-I need to see Dr.
Venible now.

53:43.872 --> 53:46.265
-Have a seat, please.
-It's okay. Come in, please.

53:49.922 --> 53:51.009
Would you please tell
Mr. Collins I'll be with him
in five minutes?

53:59.671 --> 54:00.888
Boy, am I glad to see you.

54:01.020 --> 54:02.281
Was Christine O'Hara
one of your patients?

54:08.245 --> 54:09.506
Why do you ask?

54:19.952 --> 54:21.953
-Doctor-patient privilege.
-With me?

54:25.349 --> 54:28.829
-With everyone.
-What else have you withheld?

54:28.961 --> 54:33.747
Is this an investigation,
officer? Should I be calling
my lawyer on the phone?

54:33.879 --> 54:36.576
Doctor-patient confidentiality
is privileged information

54:36.708 --> 54:38.578
It's a breach of
my oath to break it.

54:38.710 --> 54:41.668
Only medical information,
not the fact that
she was your patient.

54:41.800 --> 54:42.626
Yes, she is my patient.

54:44.106 --> 54:46.543
And I'm very sorry,
if you want any
more information,

54:46.674 --> 54:47.805
Miss O'Hara will
have to offer it.

54:48.546 --> 54:49.763
She can't offer anything.

54:50.330 --> 54:51.504
She's dead.

54:56.031 --> 54:57.423
Oh no.

54:58.686 --> 55:00.078
How?

55:00.209 --> 55:01.688
She was murdered, shot.

55:10.655 --> 55:13.787
Oh no. No. No. No.

55:25.844 --> 55:28.585
It's an emergency.
He'll have to go
to the hospital.

55:28.716 --> 55:30.108
He won't be able
to see you now.

56:07.842 --> 56:10.844
My wife's birthday.

56:10.976 --> 56:12.890
Anyway,
what are you doing here
this time of night?

56:13.021 --> 56:14.631
Going through records.

56:14.762 --> 56:18.025
Main computer shutdown again,
so it's the old fashioned way.

56:18.157 --> 56:19.070
What records?

56:21.900 --> 56:23.379
N.Y.P.D. arrest reports.

56:24.685 --> 56:26.294
Month of August.

56:26.426 --> 56:30.342
Pandering,
prostitution, soliciting,
immoral conduct.

56:30.474 --> 56:35.739
I checked aliases,
AKA's, other
burroughs, referenced hotels.

56:36.871 --> 56:39.133
She was arrested in
August or September

56:41.267 --> 56:44.312
at the Hilton,
but there's no record.

56:44.444 --> 56:47.794
She's probably a niche snitch.
The D.A.
will expunge the record.

56:47.926 --> 56:49.492
It's midnight. Go home.

56:50.058 --> 56:51.407
You're probably right.

57:10.078 --> 57:11.644
-What are you doing here?
-I want you to get in please.

57:13.212 --> 57:14.517
Please get in.

57:17.564 --> 57:19.739
What I did was to
protect Chrissy,
not to deceive you.

57:21.350 --> 57:22.525
Would you please get in?

57:27.400 --> 57:28.966
Maybe I presumed
more than you intended.

57:30.534 --> 57:34.101
If that's the case,
I apologize.
I was not casual about us,

57:34.233 --> 57:35.755
and I thought that
you weren't either.

57:39.630 --> 57:42.066
I'm
investigating a case in which
you are a prime witness...

57:42.197 --> 57:44.242
That's not what
I'm talking about.
Why don't you just say it?

57:52.469 --> 57:53.817
I wasn't casual
about it either.

1:00:24.403 --> 1:00:26.099
Onions,
mushrooms, and shallots okay?

1:00:26.710 --> 1:00:28.101
I'm really not hungry.

1:00:34.195 --> 1:00:37.676
Oh. How would you like to go
to the Hampton's this weekend?

1:00:37.808 --> 1:00:39.591
I've got a great little beach
house there, my mother and I.

1:00:39.723 --> 1:00:42.725
I have to work this weekend.

1:00:42.856 --> 1:00:45.336
What about Wednesday?
My schedule is
clear on Wednesday.

1:00:45.467 --> 1:00:46.816
If you'll excuse
me for a moment.

1:00:53.171 --> 1:00:54.214
Oh no.

1:01:16.455 --> 1:01:19.413
I like the romance of all of
this, but couldn't we just
meet in the squad room?

1:01:19.545 --> 1:01:20.676
I'm removing
myself from the case.

1:01:20.807 --> 1:01:22.068
Here here's
a sample of Venible's hair.

1:01:22.200 --> 1:01:23.113
You can cross match DNA with
the hair from Chrissy's.

1:01:23.244 --> 1:01:27.770
Also, this is
a key from his drawer.

1:01:27.901 --> 1:01:29.554
I'm pretty sure it's the key
from Chrissy's apartment.

1:01:29.686 --> 1:01:31.469
This is from her
medicine cabinet.

1:01:31.600 --> 1:01:32.992
I found it today when I was
searching her apartment.

1:01:33.124 --> 1:01:34.080
What the hell are you doing?

1:01:34.212 --> 1:01:35.952
First, you supress evidence,

1:01:36.083 --> 1:01:38.171
then you collect
hair from a suspect
without Mirandizing him.

1:01:38.303 --> 1:01:39.477
Where's your head?

1:01:39.608 --> 1:01:41.653
And you don't get
to remove yourself.

1:01:41.785 --> 1:01:44.482
What the hell is this? Are we
partners here or are we
independent contractors?

1:01:44.613 --> 1:01:46.223
Partners are supposed to
support each other...

1:01:46.354 --> 1:01:47.703
Hey, am I bothering you?

1:01:47.834 --> 1:01:49.748
Then get the hell out of here.

1:01:49.880 --> 1:01:52.229
You can't quit.
No matter what,
I won't let you.

1:02:08.376 --> 1:02:11.204
That was Davidson.
They located Lysander O'Hara.

1:02:19.474 --> 1:02:20.953
What do we have here?

1:02:21.085 --> 1:02:23.390
What we got eight car unit,
four emergency servicemen.

1:02:23.522 --> 1:02:26.132
The man is located on the
third floor barricaded,

1:02:26.264 --> 1:02:28.221
heavily armed
and flat out crazy.

1:02:31.095 --> 1:02:34.445
Okay. You, you on the roof.

1:02:34.576 --> 1:02:36.447
Get your guys in the alley.
Cover the fire escape.

1:02:57.512 --> 1:02:59.339
Lysander! Police!

1:03:21.710 --> 1:03:25.452
Lysander...Drop it.

1:03:25.584 --> 1:03:27.106
Lysander, stop!

1:03:35.246 --> 1:03:36.986
I'm okay.
I'm okay. Did I get him?

1:03:41.252 --> 1:03:42.252
You got him.

1:03:48.694 --> 1:03:51.914
All we do is a job,
Maria, not a crusade.

1:03:52.872 --> 1:03:54.655
You're not required
to betray yourself.

1:03:54.787 --> 1:03:56.179
Don't do that.

1:03:57.485 --> 1:04:00.661
Look, I tried to explain.
I am your partner.

1:04:00.793 --> 1:04:03.882
I am not going to let you make
a disaster from your life.

1:04:04.014 --> 1:04:07.712
You find yourself
someone to love,
and if it's good and real,

1:04:07.844 --> 1:04:12.151
don't flush it down the
toilet for a drug dealer
and a dead hooker.

1:04:12.283 --> 1:04:15.546
Another whiskey
and soda, double.

1:04:16.287 --> 1:04:18.418
-Give me one for her too.
-No.

1:04:20.204 --> 1:04:21.378
You're an innocent, Maria.

1:04:21.509 --> 1:04:22.945
You know nothing.

1:04:23.076 --> 1:04:24.685
There are a hundred guys
with keys to that apartment,

1:04:24.817 --> 1:04:28.341
at least a hundred
hairs on her bed.

1:04:28.473 --> 1:04:31.475
We got ourselves the killer
and he's on his way to
the morgue right now.

1:04:31.606 --> 1:04:32.519
It's over.

1:04:35.872 --> 1:04:37.655
No, it isn't not for me.

1:04:41.660 --> 1:04:44.662
Fred aren't you some kind
of hand writing expert?

1:04:46.230 --> 1:04:47.360
Yeah, it's a hobby.

1:04:48.014 --> 1:04:49.667
What do you think of this?

1:04:54.368 --> 1:04:55.325
Loony tune.

1:06:21.803 --> 1:06:22.847
Brian?

1:06:22.979 --> 1:06:24.283
Brian, what's happened?

1:06:37.689 --> 1:06:38.689
Come now.

1:06:39.299 --> 1:06:42.693
Brian, Brian, are you there?

1:06:44.913 --> 1:06:46.653
Brian, I'll be right there.

1:07:07.762 --> 1:07:09.459
-Do you know what he took?
-No.

1:07:09.590 --> 1:07:11.243
-You don't know what he took?
-No, I don't know.

1:07:15.640 --> 1:07:18.337
Don't look at me.
Don't look at me.

1:07:25.998 --> 1:07:27.390
You can go now.

1:07:27.521 --> 1:07:28.434
I'm not leaving.

1:07:32.309 --> 1:07:35.224
-Give me your arm.
Give me your arm.
-No, no.

1:08:00.380 --> 1:08:02.251
There, you see sometimes you
just have to throw the switch.

1:08:04.210 --> 1:08:05.558
The current is still floating.

1:08:18.659 --> 1:08:20.530
Not easy loving
a crazy person, is it?

1:08:25.666 --> 1:08:28.407
To continue
loving a crazy person.

1:08:34.893 --> 1:08:37.895
I need to know if Brian
has ever been violent.

1:08:42.901 --> 1:08:44.858
He's waking up.

1:08:44.990 --> 1:08:46.338
I asked if he's ever violent.

1:08:46.470 --> 1:08:48.906
What do you want? Thrills?

1:08:49.037 --> 1:08:52.692
Do you expect money
like the last one?

1:08:52.824 --> 1:08:54.433
Last one?
Was that Christine O'Hara?

1:09:00.527 --> 1:09:04.704
All right, so I come here for
the corn beef and knishes
not the service.

1:09:04.836 --> 1:09:06.619
Art and I used to
come here a lot.

1:09:08.100 --> 1:09:09.796
Brian Venible's hand writing.

1:09:09.928 --> 1:09:11.711
Analysis says schizophrenic.

1:09:12.496 --> 1:09:14.584
Maybe Chrissy knew about it.

1:09:14.715 --> 1:09:15.933
Maybe she was
blackmailing him.

1:09:16.064 --> 1:09:18.979
Lysander O'Hara killed
Chrissy and Carlos too.

1:09:19.111 --> 1:09:20.938
The case is closed.

1:09:21.069 --> 1:09:22.853
We got a backlog
of cases a foot high

1:09:22.984 --> 1:09:25.638
and the department is cutting
down on
personnelle and overtime,

1:09:25.770 --> 1:09:28.163
and we're not spending
any time on this. Capish?

1:09:33.778 --> 1:09:35.300
No, sell, Vinny.

1:09:39.087 --> 1:09:41.872
Okay. We reopen the case.

1:10:01.240 --> 1:10:04.111
Detective Quinn,
I'm Consuelo Venible.

1:10:04.243 --> 1:10:05.765
Thank you for seeing me Mrs.
Venible.

1:10:05.897 --> 1:10:08.203
What is it you want,
Miss Quinn?

1:10:08.334 --> 1:10:13.730
I want to know if
Brian is ever violent.

1:10:13.861 --> 1:10:19.692
I want to know if he's ever
tried to harm himself or
others during his episodes.

1:10:19.824 --> 1:10:23.043
Episodes?
Is that what you call it?

1:10:23.175 --> 1:10:24.784
I'm
investigating two homicides.

1:10:24.916 --> 1:10:28.135
I need to know
if Brian Venible
has any history of violence.

1:10:28.267 --> 1:10:31.269
Schizophrenics
are not necessarily
violent, Miss Quinn.

1:10:31.401 --> 1:10:34.098
They see and hear
things the rest of us do not.

1:10:34.230 --> 1:10:36.927
My son is...Come.

1:10:41.237 --> 1:10:45.675
I don't understand how Brian
can practice medicine,
the hours and the stress.

1:10:45.806 --> 1:10:48.025
Think of it as
an air conditioner.

1:10:48.156 --> 1:10:51.855
You turn it on,
you hear the noise.

1:10:51.986 --> 1:10:54.118
Then after a while,
you don't hear
the noise anymore.

1:10:54.772 --> 1:10:56.555
It's there below the surface.

1:10:57.078 --> 1:10:58.427
Like Brian's voices.

1:11:00.168 --> 1:11:02.169
Voices?

1:11:02.301 --> 1:11:05.434
Auditory and visual
hallucinations are
symptomatic of schizophrenia,

1:11:05.565 --> 1:11:06.565
didn't you know that?

1:11:11.745 --> 1:11:15.618
These voices, do they
tell him to do things?

1:11:15.749 --> 1:11:17.272
Stop wasting the city's money.

1:11:17.403 --> 1:11:19.796
It's no longer up to me, Mrs.
Venible,

1:11:19.927 --> 1:11:23.756
the district attorney has
taken up an investigation.

1:11:23.888 --> 1:11:26.585
You got the other
half of this ticket
with the time stamped on it?

1:11:26.717 --> 1:11:27.934
Yeah, in the back office.

1:11:28.066 --> 1:11:30.110
Get it for me, will you?

1:11:30.242 --> 1:11:31.851
Got his bank statements.

1:11:31.983 --> 1:11:33.940
And I got
the telephone records.

1:11:34.072 --> 1:11:36.813
Now we can take
our weekend off.

1:11:36.944 --> 1:11:38.815
Brian, sorry I'm late.

1:11:40.252 --> 1:11:41.687
It will ne very easy.

1:11:41.819 --> 1:11:44.299
All they want to do is ask you
very simple questions

1:11:44.430 --> 1:11:46.301
and you give
very brief answers.

1:11:54.135 --> 1:11:56.789
This is the assistant district
attorney and detective.

1:12:15.069 --> 1:12:17.244
The date is
Tuesday the eighth.

1:12:17.376 --> 1:12:19.464
Time is 3:50 P. M.

1:12:19.596 --> 1:12:21.292
Place is office of Arthur
Golden, assistant district
attorney of Manhattan.

1:12:21.424 --> 1:12:24.904
Present are assistant district
attorney Cynthia Clark
and Arthur Golden.

1:12:25.428 --> 1:12:27.211
Speaking.

1:12:27.343 --> 1:12:28.908
[OVER TV]   Mr. Venible you have
the right to remain silent...

1:12:29.040 --> 1:12:31.128
I would like to know...

1:12:31.259 --> 1:12:32.782
Anything you say can and
will be used against
you in a court of law.

1:12:32.913 --> 1:12:35.698
You have the right
to be represented
by an attorney.

1:12:35.829 --> 1:12:37.569
If you can't afford one, an
attorney one will be appointed
to you by the court.

1:12:37.701 --> 1:12:40.442
You may have him
with you during
questioning if you so desire.

1:12:40.573 --> 1:12:42.008
Do you understand these rights
as I have
explained them to you,

1:12:42.140 --> 1:12:43.183
and with these in mind,
do you still
want to speak to us?

1:12:43.315 --> 1:12:45.882
I thought this was merely an
examination...

1:12:46.013 --> 1:12:46.796
Yes, I understand them.

1:12:49.147 --> 1:12:51.496
When was last time you
saw Christine O'Hara?

1:12:53.151 --> 1:12:54.281
On the night that she died.

1:12:54.413 --> 1:12:55.761
What was
the occasion of that meeting?

1:12:55.893 --> 1:12:59.809
She called me because she said
she had been threatened.

1:12:59.940 --> 1:13:01.593
She asked me to
come to her apartment.

1:13:01.725 --> 1:13:03.247
She was very, very frightened.

1:13:03.379 --> 1:13:04.988
What did she want you to do?

1:13:05.119 --> 1:13:07.251
I suppose she
wanted me to protect her.

1:13:07.383 --> 1:13:09.732
What was
the nature of these threats
and who made them?

1:13:09.863 --> 1:13:11.386
I don't know.

1:13:11.517 --> 1:13:14.389
There was a voice on her
answering machine that said,

1:13:14.520 --> 1:13:18.044
"You'll never
get away with this.
I'll kill you first.

1:13:18.176 --> 1:13:20.220
"Not one cent,
you chiseling little whore."

1:13:20.352 --> 1:13:22.701
Would you repeat that please?

1:13:22.833 --> 1:13:25.095
BRIAN:   The machine said,
"Not once cent,
you chiseling little whore."

1:13:28.273 --> 1:13:29.708
Can you describe the voice?

1:13:30.667 --> 1:13:32.668
It was a man's voice.
It was deep.

1:13:32.799 --> 1:13:35.975
It was rough,
a New York accent.

1:13:37.456 --> 1:13:41.154
What did you do after she
played you these threats?

1:13:41.286 --> 1:13:43.243
I advised her to
call the police.

1:13:43.375 --> 1:13:45.245
She said she couldn't.

1:13:45.377 --> 1:13:47.030
I offered her
money to leave town.

1:13:48.336 --> 1:13:50.381
She refused.

1:13:50.513 --> 1:13:53.166
I told her she could
stay at my apartment

1:13:53.298 --> 1:13:54.559
and she wouldn't do that.

1:13:55.779 --> 1:13:58.433
She wouldn't let me
do anything for her.

1:13:58.564 --> 1:13:59.434
Did you sleep with
her at this time?

1:13:59.565 --> 1:14:01.174
I don't want
this camera going.

1:14:06.529 --> 1:14:09.095
BRIAN:   Yes.
And on another occasion,
we had been intimate.

1:14:09.227 --> 1:14:10.880
ARTHUR:   You just left
when her life was in danger?

1:14:13.057 --> 1:14:13.970
What time was this.

1:14:15.059 --> 1:14:17.408
8:00, 8:15.

1:14:17.540 --> 1:14:20.063
I have a parking ticket here
from a garage on
Sixty first street

1:14:20.194 --> 1:14:22.457
which is one block from
Chrissy's apartment,

1:14:22.588 --> 1:14:24.502
it has your license
plate number on it.

1:14:24.634 --> 1:14:27.984
It's time stamped from 7:00
until 11:25 that evening.

1:14:28.115 --> 1:14:29.768
LAWYER:   That's it's.
That's it. If you're going to
charge my client,

1:14:29.900 --> 1:14:31.161
do it now.

1:14:31.292 --> 1:14:33.859
I want a file a complaint.
I want a hearing.

1:14:33.991 --> 1:14:35.948
Save the moral outrage.

1:14:36.080 --> 1:14:37.994
That's it.
I can't take anymore of this.

1:14:38.125 --> 1:14:39.604
I cannot take anymore of it.

1:14:42.216 --> 1:14:43.913
LAWYER:   I'm
instructing you not to answer.

1:14:44.610 --> 1:14:47.133
I have here a canceled check

1:14:47.265 --> 1:14:49.353
to Christine O'Hara for
twenty thousand dollars.

1:14:49.485 --> 1:14:50.441
So what was that money for?

1:14:50.573 --> 1:14:52.225
For drug rehabilitation.

1:14:52.357 --> 1:14:54.924
Did she go into drug rehab?

1:14:55.055 --> 1:14:57.187
-No, she did not.
-That money was for blackmail,
wasn't it?

1:14:57.318 --> 1:14:58.405
-For what?
-Blackmail.

1:14:58.537 --> 1:15:00.233
Wasn't Christine
blackmailing you?

1:15:00.365 --> 1:15:02.453
Because she knew
you were mentally ill,

1:15:02.585 --> 1:15:05.717
and she asked you for money
and more money, and more until
you couldn't take it.

1:15:05.849 --> 1:15:06.979
Until you shot her!

1:15:14.335 --> 1:15:16.598
Dr. Venible, we can establish
your car in the vicinity,

1:15:16.729 --> 1:15:18.817
the key to Chrissy's apartment
and your canceled check.

1:15:22.605 --> 1:15:24.736
We have no choice but
to place you under arrest.

1:15:24.868 --> 1:15:27.130
We will set
the time and place for the
bail as soon as possible.

1:15:44.235 --> 1:15:46.236
It's her!
She's the one! Let me go!

1:15:53.636 --> 1:15:54.766
He said
"chiseling little whore."

1:15:54.898 --> 1:15:57.160
Benny Rosen said
chiseling little whore.

1:15:57.291 --> 1:15:59.510
I told you
Lysander killed her.

1:15:59.642 --> 1:16:01.077
But you had to
investigate Venible.

1:16:01.208 --> 1:16:03.993
Now what?
You want to
investigate Benny Rosen?

1:16:04.124 --> 1:16:06.038
Stop it,
Maria, the case is closed.

1:16:06.170 --> 1:16:07.518
But he said,
"chiseling little whore."

1:16:07.650 --> 1:16:11.696
You wanted off the case.
You are off the case now.

1:16:11.828 --> 1:16:15.221
You are taking the rest of
the day off and you're calling
in sick tomorrow.

1:16:15.353 --> 1:16:18.355
Or I swear I will go to I. A.
about you and Venible.

1:16:18.486 --> 1:16:20.052
Just forget it.

1:18:10.729 --> 1:18:12.251
There he is, lady.

1:18:17.344 --> 1:18:18.301
Brian,

1:18:20.739 --> 1:18:22.392
I have to ask
you some questions.

1:18:23.568 --> 1:18:25.003
No guns, no guns.

1:18:25.135 --> 1:18:26.352
No guns.

1:18:29.922 --> 1:18:31.880
You said the voice
on the answering machine

1:18:33.056 --> 1:18:35.840
said the words,
"Chiseling little whore."

1:18:37.147 --> 1:18:38.321
Can you recognize this?

1:18:38.452 --> 1:18:40.192
Not one cent you
chiseling little whore.

1:18:40.324 --> 1:18:42.281
She paid the only
way she knew how.

1:18:42.413 --> 1:18:44.022
I'm only human, sweetheart.

1:18:50.334 --> 1:18:52.030
Can you recognize
this voice that you hear?

1:18:54.294 --> 1:18:56.513
She paid me
the best way she knew how.

1:18:56.644 --> 1:18:58.210
I'm only human, sweetheart.

1:19:04.000 --> 1:19:04.869
What?

1:19:08.526 --> 1:19:10.179
Can you recognize
this voice, Brian?

1:19:11.224 --> 1:19:12.094
The other one.

1:19:14.097 --> 1:19:16.315
What? Which one?

1:19:16.447 --> 1:19:17.752
"Flush down the sewer."

1:19:22.235 --> 1:19:24.106
Flush down the sewer.

1:19:52.700 --> 1:19:54.484
Hi there, come on in.

1:19:55.747 --> 1:19:57.269
Nice to see you.

1:19:57.401 --> 1:19:58.575
This place is
not so nice, huh.

1:20:00.491 --> 1:20:02.448
Have a seat.

1:20:02.580 --> 1:20:04.842
I have a problem I
want to discuss with you.

1:20:10.718 --> 1:20:12.894
I have two murders.

1:20:13.025 --> 1:20:16.898
First, by lethal injection
of one hundred
percent heroine,

1:20:17.029 --> 1:20:21.554
not easy to acquire unless, of
course, you have access to the
N.Y.P.D. evidence locker.

1:20:22.730 --> 1:20:25.602
-You want coffee?
All I got is instant?
-No.

1:20:25.733 --> 1:20:28.866
A drink?
I mix a hell of a Manhattan.
No?

1:20:28.998 --> 1:20:30.694
I'll have some coffee.
You keep on talking.

1:20:30.826 --> 1:20:33.523
I can hear in the kitchen.

1:20:33.654 --> 1:20:37.135
The lethal
injection is supposed
to look like an OD,

1:20:37.267 --> 1:20:39.137
but suppose,

1:20:42.794 --> 1:20:47.319
just suppose a cop does it
while he's on duty.

1:20:47.451 --> 1:20:51.280
He can answer the call
and investigate his
own crime, clever.

1:20:51.411 --> 1:20:52.847
But if he goes to
all this trouble,

1:20:52.978 --> 1:20:55.153
why does he undress the victim
and give away the murder?

1:20:56.329 --> 1:20:58.417
Maybe it's a mistake.

1:20:58.549 --> 1:21:00.419
Maybe deep down he
wants to be found out.

1:21:00.986 --> 1:21:03.335
[SIGHS] Yeah. Maybe.

1:21:03.467 --> 1:21:05.337
Maybe you don't know
what you're talking about.

1:21:09.125 --> 1:21:10.386
What else?

1:21:11.127 --> 1:21:13.737
What else is
the second murder.

1:21:13.869 --> 1:21:17.523
A call girl
arrested in a vice bust
at the Hilton last fall.

1:21:17.655 --> 1:21:20.265
Guess what?
There's no
record of her arrest.

1:21:20.397 --> 1:21:21.963
Who gets an arrest expunged?

1:21:22.094 --> 1:21:24.269
Who has access
to the precinct booking slips

1:21:24.401 --> 1:21:26.663
so he can destroy
the arrest report?

1:21:26.794 --> 1:21:29.666
-Why does he want to do that?
-I don't know.

1:21:29.797 --> 1:21:31.711
She's a snitch.
It's a shake down.
Maybe it's love.

1:21:31.843 --> 1:21:35.933
Anyway something happens
and it all goes sour

1:21:36.065 --> 1:21:38.631
and he calls and makes threats
on her answering machine.

1:21:39.851 --> 1:21:42.070
Not playing with a full deck,
wouldn't you say?

1:21:42.549 --> 1:21:44.159
Right.

1:21:44.290 --> 1:21:46.639
But the recording disappears.

1:21:46.771 --> 1:21:48.641
The cop has access
to the crime scene.

1:21:48.773 --> 1:21:50.600
He removes
the tape from the machine

1:21:50.731 --> 1:21:53.385
when his
partner isn't looking.

1:21:53.517 --> 1:21:55.344
I guess the partner
is pretty dumb too.

1:21:57.651 --> 1:21:58.913
I'd say so.

1:21:59.044 --> 1:22:02.742
And then there's
this fall guy, a doctor,

1:22:02.874 --> 1:22:05.180
who how lucky can you get?
Turns out to be schizophrenic.

1:22:05.703 --> 1:22:07.225
[LAUGHING]

1:22:10.012 --> 1:22:12.578
Now we have
a hypothetical killer,

1:22:14.581 --> 1:22:17.932
setting up his new
naive partner on the doc

1:22:18.063 --> 1:22:20.673
and she sells
him out all right,
according to the plan.

1:22:22.502 --> 1:22:26.244
The only thing is
she falls in love.

1:22:28.639 --> 1:22:30.205
Not looking
through the windshield,

1:22:30.728 --> 1:22:31.946
but at it.

1:22:32.077 --> 1:22:35.471
You want to get to
a point here, Maria.

1:22:35.602 --> 1:22:37.342
I mean there they're going
into a tie breaker here.

1:22:37.474 --> 1:22:39.214
This is a very exciting match.

1:22:40.564 --> 1:22:41.825
What do I do?

1:22:41.957 --> 1:22:44.523
What you do is be a cop.

1:22:44.655 --> 1:22:47.700
What you do is
deliver your loyalty.

1:22:47.832 --> 1:22:50.268
Come on,
Maria, where's your loyalty?

1:22:51.618 --> 1:22:53.271
You got any loyalty?

1:22:53.707 --> 1:22:55.056
To who?

1:22:57.973 --> 1:22:59.669
To the lieutenant?

1:22:59.800 --> 1:23:01.018
The commissioner?

1:23:04.457 --> 1:23:06.284
Your partner.

1:23:06.416 --> 1:23:08.286
That's where you got
to be loyal, Maria.

1:23:09.680 --> 1:23:11.072
So what you do...

1:23:14.946 --> 1:23:16.555
you go to the man,

1:23:18.341 --> 1:23:20.342
you tell him what you suspect.

1:23:20.473 --> 1:23:22.431
You lay it out. You go along.

1:23:26.131 --> 1:23:28.437
The blue wall, you don't go
over that to the other side,

1:23:28.568 --> 1:23:30.308
not if you got
blood in your veins.

1:23:33.138 --> 1:23:36.010
I don't want to
miss this tie breaker.

1:23:36.141 --> 1:23:38.186
I don't play
tennis I like to watch.

1:23:43.801 --> 1:23:45.497
Are we communicating?

1:23:49.633 --> 1:23:54.202
VINCENT'S VOICE:
She was standing here.
He held the gun to her.

1:23:54.333 --> 1:23:56.465
ARTY'S VOICE:   The blue wall.
You don't go over
that to the other side,

1:23:56.596 --> 1:23:58.293
not if you got
blood in your veins.

1:23:58.424 --> 1:24:00.164
BRIAN'S VOICE:
There was a voice
on her answering machine

1:24:00.296 --> 1:24:03.689
that said I will
kill you first,
you chiseling little whore.

1:24:05.779 --> 1:24:09.217
VINCENT'S VOICE:   You want to
play by the rules?
The rules don't work.

1:24:12.264 --> 1:24:15.353
ARTY'S VOICE:
Tell him what you suspect.
Lay it out.

1:24:15.485 --> 1:24:18.008
BRAIN'S VOICE:
Flushed out in the sewer.

1:24:18.140 --> 1:24:20.358
The other one.
"Flushed out in the sewer."

1:24:22.100 --> 1:24:23.622
"Flushed out in the sewer."

1:24:26.452 --> 1:24:27.539
"Flushed out in the sewer."

1:24:32.719 --> 1:24:34.111
VINCENT: Come in, Maria.

1:24:39.378 --> 1:24:41.075
How did you find me?

1:24:55.002 --> 1:24:57.961
I played the Benny Rosen
interview for Brian Venible.

1:24:58.093 --> 1:24:59.571
He identified your voice

1:24:59.703 --> 1:25:02.531
as the man making threats
on the answering machine.

1:25:02.662 --> 1:25:06.665
Well, his elevator doesn't go
to the top floor exactly,

1:25:06.797 --> 1:25:08.711
so nobody will believe him.

1:25:10.235 --> 1:25:12.454
Why did you do it?
Money? Love?

1:25:14.761 --> 1:25:15.761
Love.

1:25:19.070 --> 1:25:21.898
Sometimes you fall in love
with the wrong people.

1:25:22.029 --> 1:25:24.553
Well, hey,
you ought to know that, huh?

1:25:28.775 --> 1:25:32.213
Christine, my God, Christine.

1:25:33.432 --> 1:25:35.129
She had you...

1:25:35.260 --> 1:25:39.481
you know by the groin
and she squeezed
life out of you

1:25:39.612 --> 1:25:41.222
and she left pulp.

1:25:43.094 --> 1:25:45.139
And how you could get away...

1:25:49.187 --> 1:25:51.232
Christine made me feel...

1:25:58.457 --> 1:25:59.849
she made me feel.

1:26:01.460 --> 1:26:03.853
So you killed her?

1:26:03.984 --> 1:26:07.248
I never killed anybody
expect in the line of duty.

1:26:07.379 --> 1:26:09.641
I think she double crossed you
in some way,

1:26:09.773 --> 1:26:11.774
and you killed Chrissy
and you killed Carlos,

1:26:11.905 --> 1:26:13.732
and you used me as your alibi.

1:26:13.864 --> 1:26:16.257
You never said one thing to me
that wasn't
lies and betrayals.

1:26:16.867 --> 1:26:19.521
I never betrayed you.

1:26:20.305 --> 1:26:23.786
I never killed anybody.

1:26:23.917 --> 1:26:26.180
Only a cop could
expunge her record.

1:26:26.311 --> 1:26:28.921
Only a cop could
destroy the booking slips.

1:26:29.053 --> 1:26:32.098
Only a cop could
lead the investigation
towards Brian Venible.

1:26:32.230 --> 1:26:33.665
Only a cop...

1:26:44.111 --> 1:26:45.329
Arty?

1:26:47.724 --> 1:26:48.724
Yeah.

1:26:56.733 --> 1:26:59.604
I wanted to kill Carlos, see?

1:26:59.736 --> 1:27:03.391
I wanted to, but I couldn't.

1:27:03.522 --> 1:27:07.003
Like Arty used to say,
"that's just not
in you, kiddo."

1:27:13.140 --> 1:27:16.882
So he did it for me
like any partner would.

1:27:18.972 --> 1:27:20.582
Why did you want
to kill Carlos?

1:27:20.713 --> 1:27:22.584
Because he was scum.

1:27:24.151 --> 1:27:28.851
You know I got
her in a program.
She was six months clean.

1:27:29.853 --> 1:27:33.638
Oh, Maria, you should
have seen her clean.

1:27:33.770 --> 1:27:35.727
Oh my God, was she beautiful?

1:27:38.340 --> 1:27:40.558
She wanted it...
She wanted to be clean.
.

1:27:40.690 --> 1:27:42.517
I swear to God.

1:27:42.648 --> 1:27:47.522
He came around tempting,
offering...

1:27:47.653 --> 1:27:50.351
-So you had him murdered?
-No.

1:27:50.482 --> 1:27:54.616
I didn't even know who did
it until I talked to
Chrissy at the loft.

1:27:54.747 --> 1:27:56.661
She saw Arty.

1:27:56.793 --> 1:27:59.447
I didn't know anything until
then. I swear to you,
I swear to God.

1:28:00.579 --> 1:28:04.060
Well, what are we
going to do now, huh?

1:28:07.891 --> 1:28:09.413
What do you think?

1:28:16.247 --> 1:28:19.118
If he killed Carlos for you,
why did he kill Chrissy?

1:28:19.250 --> 1:28:21.599
Chrissy saw him in the loft,

1:28:21.731 --> 1:28:23.297
she knew he did it.

1:28:27.737 --> 1:28:30.608
She wanted money
from him and from me.

1:28:32.959 --> 1:28:37.659
I loved this girl so much,
and she was blackmailing me.

1:28:41.185 --> 1:28:44.013
She was a tramp
truth be known.

1:29:43.943 --> 1:29:46.380
We don't have to
soil his memory, do we?

1:29:54.780 --> 1:29:58.000
Oh, Vinny, another betrayal.

1:29:59.263 --> 1:30:01.351
We can't.

1:30:01.483 --> 1:30:03.222
The whole thing
has been betrayal.

1:30:03.354 --> 1:30:05.094
Everybody betraying everybody.

1:30:06.662 --> 1:30:07.879
Me included.

1:30:08.272 --> 1:30:10.926
I know.

1:30:11.057 --> 1:30:14.886
It ends here.
You break
the rules enough, you pay.

1:30:17.977 --> 1:30:20.109
We're all paying
one way or another.

1:30:24.506 --> 1:30:26.202
So what about your
career now, Vinny?

1:30:26.725 --> 1:30:28.726
Water in the basket.

1:30:30.773 --> 1:30:32.121
What about your conscience?

1:30:33.253 --> 1:30:36.125
That concerns me
less than it used to.

1:30:39.346 --> 1:30:41.522
I may have to bring
you in, you know that.

1:30:42.393 --> 1:30:44.916
It's all
a series of questions.

1:30:47.180 --> 1:30:50.052
Vinny, you want to go
to the grocer's for me?

1:30:50.183 --> 1:30:52.924
Vinny, what will
you do with your life?

1:30:53.056 --> 1:30:56.537
Why aren't you ever home
with me and the kids?

1:30:58.235 --> 1:31:03.631
Hey, Vinny, what are you going
to do with
the rest of your life?

1:31:05.155 --> 1:31:09.463
So that's what happens, huh?

1:31:13.380 --> 1:31:15.338
I hope I never
wind up like that.

1:31:15.470 --> 1:31:17.166
You won't be able to help it.

1:31:55.466 --> 1:31:57.685
I must live
a restricted life now.

1:31:58.295 --> 1:31:59.991
Do you understand?

1:32:03.039 --> 1:32:07.564
Diet, sleep, avoiding stress.

1:32:10.525 --> 1:32:14.223
That and my work,
it's all there is
room for in my life.

1:32:19.534 --> 1:32:22.666
So, it was casual after all?

1:32:32.547 --> 1:32:34.156
No. No, it wasn't.

1:32:35.158 --> 1:32:37.028
It never was.

1:32:39.423 --> 1:32:40.771
I'm sorry.

1:32:42.513 --> 1:32:43.644
Yeah.

1:32:45.864 --> 1:32:46.864
Me too.

1:33:06.493 --> 1:33:08.190
Never get out of the boat
while it's rocking.

1:33:20.420 --> 1:33:25.381
First,
get a picture of the scene.

1:33:25.512 --> 1:33:27.209
Don't be in a hurry.

1:33:35.348 --> 1:33:37.959
The victim will still
be dead in the morning.
