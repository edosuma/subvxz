[shouts] Just a minute!

01:13.406 --> 01:15.450
[shouts] It's always open, Matt.

01:16.785 --> 01:17.744
Happy New...

01:17.827 --> 01:18.828
Oh...

01:20.622 --> 01:21.790
You're not Matt.

01:21.873 --> 01:22.957
Wow.

01:24.125 --> 01:26.211
You don't even need to sign for this.

01:26.294 --> 01:30.340
Oh, no, I was just expecting
my boyfriend back from India.

01:30.423 --> 01:31.424
Uh-huh.

01:31.508 --> 01:32.509
Thank you.

01:33.593 --> 01:35.386
No, no, no. Thank you.

01:41.392 --> 01:43.061
Hey, there's a package!

01:43.144 --> 01:45.396
Although not the package I was hoping for.

01:46.105 --> 01:47.065
Ooh,

01:47.148 --> 01:48.191
this is for me.

01:48.858 --> 01:50.110
This is the Argentinean dress

01:50.193 --> 01:53.196
Fernando wants me to wear
for the New Year's Eve party tonight.

01:53.279 --> 01:56.116
Oh, that is so sweet.

02:02.539 --> 02:04.040
And so hideous.

02:05.917 --> 02:08.086
There's no way I'm wearing this.

02:08.169 --> 02:10.505
It's way too big and bright and loud.

02:12.257 --> 02:13.550
And that's coming from me.

02:15.468 --> 02:18.930
-So what are you going to tell Fernando?
-Oh, I'm gonna tell him the truth.

02:19.013 --> 02:19.931
That it never came.

02:21.432 --> 02:22.559
[doorbell rings]

02:25.019 --> 02:26.980
It's always open, Matt.

02:28.565 --> 02:29.941
Sorry. Not Matt.

02:30.942 --> 02:32.735
Is he coming back today?

02:32.819 --> 02:35.155
No, she always wears
leg makeup for breakfast.

02:36.531 --> 02:39.993
Hey, Deej, I bought so much awesome stuff
for your New Year's party.

02:40.076 --> 02:42.996
And guess what, it was all 90% off.
Can you believe it?

02:44.789 --> 02:48.084
Yes, I can.
Because those are from last year.

02:49.961 --> 02:52.630
Would you mind returning all this stuff,
angel food cake?

02:52.714 --> 02:57.218
It's just, there's some stuff I need to...
talk to DJ about, OK, pudding pop?

02:58.720 --> 03:01.014
Yeah, and maybe DJ can help you

03:01.097 --> 03:04.100
come up with a nickname for me
that, I don't know, isn't a food.

03:05.476 --> 03:06.936
We will work on that, sugar.

03:07.937 --> 03:08.813
Packet.

03:10.481 --> 03:11.858
-Love you.
-I love you.

03:13.568 --> 03:15.320
-See you guys later.
-Bye.

03:15.403 --> 03:16.237
Bye, lamb chop.

03:21.784 --> 03:24.454
OK. Really big news.
You'd better sit down.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.706
That's not the big news, by the way.

03:29.042 --> 03:31.210
I wanna propose to CJ tonight.

03:34.130 --> 03:35.590
You wanna propose tonight?

03:35.673 --> 03:36.674
Yes!

03:36.758 --> 03:37.842
In my house?

03:37.926 --> 03:38.801
Yes.

03:39.469 --> 03:40.511
Right in front of me?

03:41.387 --> 03:42.847
You know, maybe, or to the side of you.

03:42.931 --> 03:44.974
I haven't figured out
where everybody's standing yet.

03:46.517 --> 03:49.103
But listen, I'm pretty sure
I know what I wanna say,

03:49.187 --> 03:50.563
but can I run it by you first?

03:50.647 --> 03:53.650
And by run it by you first, I mean
will you please write it for me?

03:56.486 --> 03:57.946
Yes, sure. Of course.

03:58.029 --> 04:01.574
It's always been my dream to write
my ex-boyfriend's marriage proposal.

04:03.326 --> 04:04.786
So what have you got so far?

04:04.869 --> 04:05.870
Oh, um...

04:17.131 --> 04:17.966
"CJ..."

04:19.217 --> 04:20.134
That's it.

04:24.055 --> 04:25.181
It's a good start.

04:26.307 --> 04:30.144
You know what, I can't say what's
in my heart without food in my stomach.

04:30.228 --> 04:31.813
I'm gonna go nuke a frozen pizza.

04:33.064 --> 04:34.274
[doorbell rings]

04:37.944 --> 04:39.362
[shouts] Come in, Matt!

04:39.946 --> 04:40.863
Hi.

04:45.660 --> 04:46.953
Happy New Year.

04:58.298 --> 05:01.551
How perfect that we are picking up
our adopted baby in San Francisco.

05:01.634 --> 05:03.720
Now we can ring in the New Year
with you guys.

05:03.803 --> 05:04.679
Yeah.

05:05.388 --> 05:07.682
It's almost like
every important moment in our life

05:07.765 --> 05:10.768
always happens in this house
or around this house.

05:11.728 --> 05:13.896
Seriously, thank you guys
for driving up last minute

05:13.980 --> 05:15.606
to share this beautiful moment with us.

05:15.690 --> 05:17.567
Wouldn't miss it for the world, Jess.

05:17.650 --> 05:20.653
Plus you're driving me
to my colonoscopy on Monday.

05:23.573 --> 05:26.284
I brought a little friend with me,
hope you don't mind.

05:26.367 --> 05:27.410
[all] Ah...

05:31.664 --> 05:34.292
[funny voice]
This is something I would not miss.

05:36.127 --> 05:38.546
-You wanna... ?
- Yeah.

05:38.629 --> 05:40.256
-Hi, Danny.
-I'll get the luggage.

05:40.339 --> 05:41.716
Hi, Danny. Hi, Jess.

05:42.508 --> 05:43.843
-Bye, Danny.
-Bye.

05:43.926 --> 05:45.094
Bye, Jess.

05:49.515 --> 05:51.893
OK, this filter makes us look like
we're in Tokyo,

05:51.976 --> 05:54.437
so everyone yell "Happy New Year"
in Japanese.

05:56.355 --> 05:57.523
How do you say that?

05:58.524 --> 06:00.610
I don't know. I was born in Fresno.

06:03.071 --> 06:04.739
OK, fine. Say...

06:04.822 --> 06:06.949
[speaking Japanese]

06:07.033 --> 06:10.161
[all repeat]

06:12.955 --> 06:13.998
What are you doing here?

06:14.082 --> 06:17.585
Mom said you guys have to include me
in your New Year's Eve party.

06:17.668 --> 06:19.337
So what's up, my squad?

06:20.963 --> 06:22.465
We are not your squad.

06:26.135 --> 06:28.137
Perhaps you didn't hear me.

06:28.971 --> 06:30.890
Mom said.

06:34.727 --> 06:37.146
So let's start-ay this part-ay.

06:38.314 --> 06:39.857
Hey, Max.

06:39.941 --> 06:42.777
I think that this part-ay
needs some guacamol-ay,

06:42.860 --> 06:44.195
if you know what I'm saying.

06:44.904 --> 06:46.155
Sure, big bro.

06:50.409 --> 06:52.870
Be back with the dippin',
so don't be trippin'.

06:54.872 --> 06:56.124
Yo, yo.

07:02.672 --> 07:04.298
We gotta get rid of Max tonight.

07:04.882 --> 07:06.467
I know a guy who knows a guy.

07:07.927 --> 07:09.679
Not that kind of "get rid of."

07:10.388 --> 07:12.598
I don't want him messing up
the midnight kisses.

07:12.682 --> 07:14.517
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

07:14.600 --> 07:16.894
We haven't agreed to any kisses.

07:16.978 --> 07:18.980
Uh... I did.

07:21.858 --> 07:24.777
Are you still mad at me
about that hippo video?

07:24.861 --> 07:26.446
I said I was sorry.

07:26.529 --> 07:28.489
And I've been giving you lots of stuff.

07:30.283 --> 07:33.536
I do appreciate
the vanilla scented candle,

07:33.619 --> 07:35.621
and the Quiznos punch card.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.750
If you buy three more subs,
you get a free panini.

07:41.878 --> 07:44.046
But I'm still not promising any kisses.

07:44.672 --> 07:45.506
I understand.

07:46.174 --> 07:49.760
I can't buy your love
with bribes, gifts and trinkets.

07:51.512 --> 07:53.181
Here, have a Toblerone.

07:55.766 --> 07:57.977
You are a good eater, little dude.

07:59.979 --> 08:04.400
Well, I've got to admit, adopting a baby
is way easier than being pregnant.

08:06.360 --> 08:08.070
I've already lost the baby weight.

08:10.239 --> 08:13.451
And you can have
one of my world-famous piña Gibbladas.

08:15.161 --> 08:17.788
Served in a baby bottle,
because you're having a baby.

08:18.414 --> 08:21.042
And Fernando's not ready for a sippy cup.

08:22.960 --> 08:25.546
[Spanish accent] I'm only spilling my wine
because I'm upset.

08:27.215 --> 08:29.967
Kimberlina's Argentinean dress
was lost in the mail.

08:32.762 --> 08:36.390
I checked the tracking online
and they said it was delivered here today.

08:38.559 --> 08:39.393
They did?

08:39.477 --> 08:40.937
Yes.

08:41.854 --> 08:45.691
I assume it went to the wrong house,
so I've been up and down the block,

08:45.775 --> 08:46.901
pounding on doors.

08:49.111 --> 08:50.112
You have?

08:51.155 --> 08:52.281
Yes.

08:54.116 --> 08:56.994
And the harder I knock,
the less they answer.

08:58.079 --> 09:01.332
So I would yell, "Have you seen my dress?"

09:03.084 --> 09:04.001
And they would yell...

09:04.085 --> 09:06.212
[American accent]
"We're calling the police."

09:11.509 --> 09:15.596
I remember when Kimmy and I were kids,
our mom used to feed us creamed spinach.

09:16.806 --> 09:18.391
Only she called it ice cream.

09:20.476 --> 09:21.310
Yeah.

09:21.394 --> 09:24.897
Can you imagine how upset I was
when I finally tasted real ice cream?

09:26.649 --> 09:28.693
-Hey, hun. You want a Gibblada?
-Yeah.

09:28.776 --> 09:31.028
They are almost as good
as your Gibbler-itas.

09:32.655 --> 09:33.614
Mmm.

09:34.073 --> 09:36.242
Hey, I was thinking, Steph-Boyardee.

09:37.743 --> 09:41.289
Maybe one day we'll have
one of these baby people.

09:41.914 --> 09:43.332
One that we make together.

09:44.542 --> 09:45.960
What are you talking about?

09:47.461 --> 09:51.424
Well, you see, when a man and a woman
love each other very, very much--

09:51.507 --> 09:52.925
-Jimmy--
-There's a stork involved--

09:53.009 --> 09:55.636
Yes, OK. Yes. I know how babies are made.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.054
[sighs with relief]

09:57.138 --> 09:59.890
Good, 'cause that talk
is always so awkward.

10:02.059 --> 10:02.893
Yes, it is.

10:02.977 --> 10:04.103
[giggles nervously]

10:08.566 --> 10:09.650
Good job, Cosmo.

10:09.734 --> 10:11.611
I wish I was as regular as you are.

10:14.196 --> 10:17.992
Come on, let us manly men
enjoy this manly drink on this manly lawn,

10:18.075 --> 10:20.161
while I build us a manly campfire.

10:21.787 --> 10:24.290
Mmm. Fire good.

10:26.459 --> 10:28.336
Jess, we are so happy for you.

10:28.419 --> 10:29.503
Thank you.

10:29.587 --> 10:33.591
Do you realize we celebrated
just like this right before DJ was born,

10:33.674 --> 10:35.926
almost 40 years ago?

10:36.010 --> 10:39.055
40 years ago.
Man, we are old farts, aren't we?

10:39.138 --> 10:40.556
[all laugh]

10:40.640 --> 10:42.099
Hey, to farts.

10:42.183 --> 10:43.225
[all] To farts.

10:46.604 --> 10:48.522
Well, you know guys,
I've been thinking a lot

10:48.606 --> 10:51.317
about who's going to be
the Godfather to my new baby.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.235
Well, we're all brothers here,

10:53.319 --> 10:56.197
so whoever you pick,
I'm completely fine with it.

10:56.280 --> 10:57.907
Thank you, Danny, 'cause I picked Joey.

11:00.660 --> 11:04.705
Jess, I am just so honored.
Sorry, Joey, better luck next time.

11:06.624 --> 11:09.126
-Danny, he just picked me.
-Yeah, Danny, I just picked him.

11:09.210 --> 11:10.378
Oh.

11:10.461 --> 11:11.337
OK.

11:13.005 --> 11:15.716
Thanks, Jess. I'm the Godfather.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.051
[laughs]

11:17.134 --> 11:19.804
[mimics Marlon Brando]
You made me an offer I can't refuse.

11:21.013 --> 11:24.016
[laughs] That's good.

11:24.100 --> 11:27.686
I just want to be clear right now
that my feelings are not hurt in any way.

11:27.770 --> 11:32.233
I am... completely fine with this.
I'm fine as fine could be.

11:32.316 --> 11:36.404
Look, the only reason why I picked Joey
was because he's still raising kids.

11:36.487 --> 11:38.030
Joey still is a kid.

11:40.324 --> 11:42.034
[whines] I am not a kid.

11:43.119 --> 11:47.123
Jess, I think you're forgetting
how wonderful my three girls turned out.

11:47.206 --> 11:50.501
Uh, Danny, with all due respect,

11:50.584 --> 11:55.798
I think you're forgetting that Jess and I
did a lot of the parenting, right, Jess?

11:55.881 --> 11:59.301
Yeah, you know, you'd go to work all day
and we'd be home raising the kids,

11:59.385 --> 12:01.804
and scrubbing the floors,
and gosh darn it, we made sure

12:01.887 --> 12:04.390
we looked beautiful for you
by the time you got home.

12:08.853 --> 12:13.107
Look, if it means that much to you,
you can be the Godfather.

12:13.190 --> 12:14.275
No, thank you.

12:15.693 --> 12:17.319
I ain't no scrub.

12:20.531 --> 12:23.367
All right, fine.
Joey, you're back to being the Godfather.

12:23.451 --> 12:27.621
No, not after you take it away
and then give it to Danny.

12:27.705 --> 12:30.332
[mimics Brando] You come to me
and you say "Don Corleone,

12:32.042 --> 12:33.544
bring me justice."

12:35.171 --> 12:37.298
But you don't ask with respect.

12:38.966 --> 12:41.719
-Did you memorize that whole movie?
-What movie?

12:43.679 --> 12:46.015
All right, buddy, good night.

12:46.640 --> 12:48.559
Happy New Year, we'll see you next year.

12:50.728 --> 12:51.645
Hey, Aunt Becky,

12:52.646 --> 12:56.442
does adopting feel any different than
when you were expecting Nicky and Alex?

12:56.525 --> 12:59.570
Well, no one's doing cartwheels
on my bladder, so that's good.

13:01.071 --> 13:03.282
But if you're asking me
how it feels emotionally,

13:03.365 --> 13:04.658
it feels exactly the same.

13:05.409 --> 13:06.368
Really?

13:06.452 --> 13:07.286
Yes.

13:07.661 --> 13:09.914
It feels just as important and exciting,

13:09.997 --> 13:13.542
and I'm already crazy about this baby
and we haven't even met.

13:14.335 --> 13:15.377
Why do you ask?

13:15.461 --> 13:19.048
Well, I found out a while ago that
I won't be able to have kids of my own.

13:20.341 --> 13:22.259
Oh, Steph, I had no idea.

13:23.219 --> 13:24.053
It's all right.

13:24.762 --> 13:29.141
But, you know, one day,
maybe adopting will be an option for me.

13:29.725 --> 13:31.727
And Jimmy, if we wind up together.

13:31.810 --> 13:35.856
Well, you will make a wonderful mother
to a very lucky child.

13:38.108 --> 13:39.109
Thanks, Aunt Becky.

13:39.193 --> 13:41.237
Has Jimmy been asking you
about having kids?

13:41.320 --> 13:45.908
Yeah, but I think we should start with
a plant first and see how that goes.

13:47.535 --> 13:48.702
[Steph laughs]

13:50.496 --> 13:54.250
Do you really think Max is going to fall
for the old Netflix fake countdown?

13:54.333 --> 13:58.546
Of course he is. The fake countdown
was invented for gullible little kids.

14:00.256 --> 14:02.758
Totally.
Your mom fooled you with it last year.

14:04.385 --> 14:05.678
That's how I know it works.

14:07.304 --> 14:08.806
OK, teen squad.

14:08.889 --> 14:10.849
Time to get our sugar freak on.

14:12.810 --> 14:14.228
You made it back just in time!

14:14.311 --> 14:15.396
It's almost midnight.

14:15.479 --> 14:16.564
Already?

14:18.899 --> 14:20.776
Seems like it was just 9:30.

14:22.152 --> 14:23.320
Oh! Look at the iPad!

14:25.072 --> 14:26.198
It's almost midnight!

14:26.782 --> 14:27.700
Here we go.

14:29.326 --> 14:30.452
In five...

14:30.536 --> 14:33.622
[all shout] ...four, three, two, one.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.875
Happy New Year!

14:35.958 --> 14:37.960
[blowing horns]

14:45.843 --> 14:48.262
[yawns] Man, what a night.

14:48.762 --> 14:50.431
I am bushed.

14:50.890 --> 14:53.225
Yeah, that was insane.

14:55.269 --> 14:57.313
[sighs] Well, I guess it's bedtime.

14:57.688 --> 14:59.607
Awesome partying with you, Max.

15:00.566 --> 15:01.442
That's it?

15:04.153 --> 15:06.071
This New Year's thing is way overhyped.

15:07.698 --> 15:10.910
Hey, thanks for giving up your bed
and bunking with Tommy.

15:10.993 --> 15:12.578
Here's Uni the unicorn.

15:13.537 --> 15:16.957
Cool hang, man. You're the best
big brother a kid could ever have.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.127
Yep, well... that's what
I've been telling ya.

15:21.921 --> 15:24.882
-All right, see ya.
-[all] Bye, happy New Year!

15:24.965 --> 15:27.968
Gotta get some sleeps. Max out, my peeps.

15:32.598 --> 15:36.560
I have to admit,
I will be happy to see 2016 gone.

15:36.644 --> 15:39.271
First your dress gets lost in the mail...

15:42.024 --> 15:44.568
and then I see Cosmo
dragging the same dress across the floor.

15:44.652 --> 15:45.694
[shouts] Say what?

15:49.865 --> 15:53.702
Now before you get upset, there's a
very reasonable explanation for all this.

15:54.620 --> 15:55.829
The dress arrived.

15:56.372 --> 15:58.415
It was hideous,
so I hid it in the dog house.

16:01.752 --> 16:03.337
Thank you for your dishonesty.

16:05.255 --> 16:06.757
Now goodbye forever.

16:12.596 --> 16:13.681
Why are you still here?

16:16.100 --> 16:18.477
I thought you would go.
I'm not missing the party.

16:19.728 --> 16:21.230
[doorbell rings]

16:23.857 --> 16:25.401
[shouts] Come on in, Matt!

16:27.486 --> 16:28.362
Still not Matt.

16:30.322 --> 16:34.368
Oh, wow, you guys look gorgeous.

16:34.451 --> 16:37.955
We were at the Bay Area
Podiatrists annual New Year's Gala.

16:38.038 --> 16:39.999
We call it the foot ball.

16:40.082 --> 16:41.166
The foot ball, get it?

16:42.376 --> 16:45.462
Just because no one laughs
doesn't mean they don't get it.

16:47.673 --> 16:49.466
Where's my boyfriend Max?

16:49.550 --> 16:51.635
Oh he's upstairs with the other kids.

16:51.719 --> 16:54.596
Well, then, if you'll excuse me,
my true love awaits.

16:57.224 --> 16:58.475
-Excuse me, honey.
-Yeah.

16:58.559 --> 16:59.476
DJ.

16:59.977 --> 17:03.522
OK, I've been trying to memorize my speech
but it won't stay in my brain.

17:03.605 --> 17:04.565
I keep freezing up.

17:04.648 --> 17:07.234
No, it's OK.
We'll sneak in a practice later.

17:07.818 --> 17:10.070
You guys are being
pretty secretive over here.

17:10.154 --> 17:11.196
No, we're not, you are.

17:13.574 --> 17:14.408
I mean...

17:15.367 --> 17:16.869
No, you're not, we are.

17:18.787 --> 17:20.831
I mean... Uh...

17:21.331 --> 17:22.624
Mmm...

17:34.595 --> 17:35.512
Max?

17:36.055 --> 17:37.264
Max, wake up.

17:37.347 --> 17:38.432
It's Rose.

17:39.391 --> 17:40.225
Rose?

17:40.934 --> 17:43.353
What are you doing here
in the middle of the night?

17:44.563 --> 17:46.607
I'm here for the New Year's party.

17:46.690 --> 17:47.900
But it's already over.

17:49.651 --> 17:51.403
No, it's not even 11:00 yet.

17:52.196 --> 17:53.238
Look.

17:54.823 --> 17:56.325
[shouts] I've been duped!

17:58.827 --> 18:00.537
By my own brother.

18:01.955 --> 18:05.417
So his wicked teen squad can have
their precious New Year's kisses

18:05.501 --> 18:07.002
without me in the way.

18:08.087 --> 18:12.424
[shouts] But as God is my witness,
their lips shall not touch tonight!

18:13.842 --> 18:14.718
[sighs]

18:16.095 --> 18:18.180
I've never seen this side of you.

18:20.307 --> 18:21.725
But I like it!

18:24.436 --> 18:26.730
Hey, am I wasting my time with Ramona?

18:27.231 --> 18:30.859
Well, I mean, she's a great girl,
but... you're working too hard.

18:31.735 --> 18:33.737
The hat, the swagger,

18:34.196 --> 18:35.489
the duty-free Toblerone.

18:38.325 --> 18:39.326
Maybe you're right.

18:39.409 --> 18:40.994
Maybe less is more.

18:41.870 --> 18:45.541
Because less of Popko
is more than most girls can handle.

18:47.334 --> 18:48.502
You're doing it again.

18:49.962 --> 18:51.046
Really?

18:51.130 --> 18:52.756
I thought I'd dialed it way back.

18:55.384 --> 18:56.593
Duty-free cologne.

19:02.015 --> 19:03.016
And we...

19:03.600 --> 19:04.476
[both] ...step.

19:06.603 --> 19:08.856
So, are you gonna kiss Popko or not?

19:09.773 --> 19:10.858
I don't know.

19:10.941 --> 19:14.987
He's cute, but the hat and the swagger...

19:15.571 --> 19:17.156
And he wears so much cologne.

19:17.239 --> 19:18.407
[sniffs]

19:18.490 --> 19:19.908
I can smell him right now.

19:23.036 --> 19:25.122
Oh, it's almost midnight. Let's go.

19:31.420 --> 19:32.379
The door's stuck!

19:35.799 --> 19:36.717
It won't open.

19:37.926 --> 19:40.387
[both groan with effort]

19:42.639 --> 19:44.474
-[shouts] Help!
-[shouts] Help! Let us out!

19:44.558 --> 19:47.603
[both shout] Help us! Let us out!

19:49.146 --> 19:50.772
[shouting continues]

19:55.235 --> 19:57.738
Happy New Year, suckers!

19:58.405 --> 20:00.574
[Jackson shouts]
Max, we're gonna miss the countdown.

20:01.200 --> 20:05.704
No, you're not. It was two hours ago.

20:08.248 --> 20:10.375
I love the way you handle your business.

20:12.502 --> 20:16.298
I should never have told you about that
time Rusty did this to me and Stephanie.

20:17.424 --> 20:19.009
Jackson had it coming.

20:19.092 --> 20:21.094
He tricked me into going to bed early.

20:21.178 --> 20:23.764
Well, I'm sure Jackson learned his lesson.

20:24.389 --> 20:25.557
It's open.

20:26.975 --> 20:29.102
Hey, apologize to your brother.

20:30.854 --> 20:32.064
I'm sorry, little buddy.

20:32.147 --> 20:33.607
Don't "little buddy" me.

20:35.525 --> 20:38.070
Come on, guys,
let's go ring in the New Year!

20:38.153 --> 20:39.321
-All right.
-[all] Let's go.

20:40.572 --> 20:43.200
The only thing I'm gonna ring in
is revenge.

20:45.994 --> 20:47.663
Sorry you had to see me like this.

20:49.873 --> 20:51.333
It's all right, Max.

20:51.416 --> 20:53.543
You didn't choose the thug life.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.256
The thug life chose you.

21:03.053 --> 21:05.305
All these years
you guys have lived here for free.

21:05.389 --> 21:08.350
Do you have any idea how much money
I've saved you both in rent?

21:10.102 --> 21:12.771
You have any idea
how much we saved you in babysitting?

21:13.355 --> 21:15.107
Come on, guys. It's New Year's Eve.

21:15.190 --> 21:17.067
No, no... this is good.

21:17.150 --> 21:18.235
This is good.

21:18.318 --> 21:22.531
After 40 years of non-stop hugging
and those sappy heart talks...

21:25.033 --> 21:26.243
let's get real.

21:28.078 --> 21:30.789
You clearly have something to say to me,
so come on, Danny, say it.

21:30.872 --> 21:33.292
I don't think you wanna go there.

21:34.334 --> 21:35.544
Oh, yeah?

21:35.627 --> 21:37.337
Well, I'm already there.

21:38.922 --> 21:40.757
Well, I think you should leave.

21:41.967 --> 21:43.135
Well, it's a little too late,

21:43.218 --> 21:46.805
'cause I already put my jammies on
and I'm sipping my sleepy-time tea.

21:48.223 --> 21:49.433
Here's the brutal truth.

21:50.100 --> 21:51.059
"Forever"

21:51.560 --> 21:53.020
is not my favorite song.

21:53.103 --> 21:54.021
[gasps]

21:58.775 --> 22:00.736
That is a lie.

22:02.321 --> 22:03.697
Everyone loves "Forever".

22:03.780 --> 22:04.823
Do they?

22:07.451 --> 22:09.494
It is kind of a snoozer.

22:10.996 --> 22:13.957
You know, I have a few words for you
that I've been dying to say.

22:14.624 --> 22:16.043
I hate Mr. Woodchuck.

22:16.960 --> 22:18.628
That is a lie.

22:18.712 --> 22:20.964
Everyone loves Mr. Woodchuck.

22:22.341 --> 22:23.675
Do they?

22:24.926 --> 22:27.220
At least Mr. Woodchuck
doesn't dye his hair.

22:30.015 --> 22:31.933
Mr. Jesse does not dye his hair.

22:33.018 --> 22:36.146
[funny voice] Well, your pillowcase
tells a different story.

22:38.607 --> 22:40.358
Hey, Joey, speaking of hair,

22:40.984 --> 22:43.612
where did you get yours cut,
at a barber college?

22:44.529 --> 22:46.740
Those students need the practice.

22:50.786 --> 22:52.079
And listen to this, Danny.

22:52.162 --> 22:57.417
The only reason people watch Wake Up USA
is because they like Becky.

22:59.920 --> 23:01.546
That is a lie.

23:02.881 --> 23:04.424
Everyone loves me.

23:04.508 --> 23:05.967
Do they?

23:07.803 --> 23:08.845
Yes, they do.

23:09.554 --> 23:10.555
Women adore me.

23:11.890 --> 23:14.518
And men find me... non-threatening.

23:16.937 --> 23:19.064
Are you sure it's not
the other way around?

23:20.232 --> 23:22.275
Guys, I need your help.

23:22.359 --> 23:23.985
I wanna make Jackson disappear.

23:26.154 --> 23:27.197
Max, come here.

23:28.615 --> 23:30.367
What are you talking about, son?

23:30.450 --> 23:32.035
I want him lost at sea,

23:32.119 --> 23:34.204
so I need a boat, a broken compass

23:34.287 --> 23:36.957
and enough gas
to get him to the Bermuda Triangle.

23:38.750 --> 23:41.711
Well, that's a well-laid-out plan,

23:41.795 --> 23:44.673
but what did Jackson do
to deserve all that?

23:44.756 --> 23:47.300
My own brother stabbed me in the back.

23:47.384 --> 23:48.885
I know what that feels like.

23:48.969 --> 23:50.929
I thought he was my best friend!

23:51.471 --> 23:52.430
I can relate to that.

23:52.514 --> 23:55.267
You think you know a guy your whole life

23:55.350 --> 23:56.893
and you don't know him at all.

23:56.977 --> 23:58.854
Preach, brother. Preach.

24:00.021 --> 24:03.567
Sometimes people close to you,
they do things that make you mad.

24:03.650 --> 24:07.904
If you hang out with someone long enough
that's bound to happen.

24:08.905 --> 24:10.657
Max, let me ask you something.

24:12.325 --> 24:13.535
Do you love your brother?

24:14.703 --> 24:15.954
Is this off the record?

24:17.455 --> 24:18.456
-Yes.
-Yeah.

24:18.540 --> 24:20.417
I guess I love the big dope.

24:22.169 --> 24:25.172
So the secret to getting along
with people that you love...

24:26.673 --> 24:28.300
is forgiveness.

24:28.383 --> 24:29.968
Yeah, 'cause nobody's perfect.

24:30.051 --> 24:31.261
And in the end...

24:32.721 --> 24:34.389
nothing's more important than...

24:35.056 --> 24:36.433
loving your bothers.

24:40.103 --> 24:41.271
I guess you're right.

24:41.354 --> 24:43.440
I should go give my brother a hug.

24:44.608 --> 24:46.318
-Thanks, Grandpa.
-I love you.

24:47.360 --> 24:48.904
And Uncle Jesse and Joey.

24:50.238 --> 24:51.114
All right, buddy.

24:51.198 --> 24:54.284
[laughs] I forgot
what a great team we are.

24:54.367 --> 24:57.621
Yeah, we helped the kid out
and I taught you two jokers a good lesson.

24:58.830 --> 25:02.626
You know, the kid did have a great idea
about... hugging your brothers.

25:07.130 --> 25:08.048
Love you guys.

25:08.590 --> 25:11.301
Well, as long as we're
in the spirit of forgiveness,

25:11.384 --> 25:12.802
come here, little guy.

25:13.845 --> 25:14.721
Aww...

25:14.804 --> 25:16.848
Yaaaah!

25:16.932 --> 25:18.016
[splash]

25:21.811 --> 25:22.854
[sighs]

25:22.938 --> 25:24.773
When I look into your future,

25:25.398 --> 25:26.775
I see my eyes.

25:29.611 --> 25:31.780
That cannot be right.
Let me see the speech again.

25:31.863 --> 25:33.823
No, no. Steve, you know this.

25:33.907 --> 25:36.409
No, the closer it gets to midnight,
the less I remember.

25:36.493 --> 25:40.247
-Just calm down, OK? And try it again.
-OK.

25:40.330 --> 25:41.539
[exhales]

25:42.540 --> 25:44.376
I remember the first time I saw you.

25:44.459 --> 25:45.669
You were so beautiful.

25:47.295 --> 25:48.880
You're even more beautiful now.

25:49.673 --> 25:51.132
I love you so much.

25:52.425 --> 25:54.219
I knew you were still in love with her.

25:54.302 --> 25:56.763
Steve, how could you do this to me?

25:56.846 --> 25:59.307
No, no, CJ, it's not what you think.

25:59.391 --> 26:00.684
Tell her what we're doing.

Uh... um... I, uh...

26:05.730 --> 26:09.651
-No, I was practicing my proposal to you.
-A little late, Steve.

26:11.820 --> 26:12.946
CJ, wait!

26:13.029 --> 26:15.365
-No, Steve, tell her!
-I've heard enough.

26:17.367 --> 26:18.535
OK, I'm listening.

26:20.662 --> 26:21.871
I'm blanking.

26:22.414 --> 26:26.251
Literally... my mind is a burrito.

26:28.461 --> 26:29.838
DJ, help me!

26:30.672 --> 26:31.756
Words say you.

26:33.258 --> 26:34.509
Ring. Take.

26:35.677 --> 26:36.928
-Really?
-Really.

26:37.012 --> 26:37.971
OK.

26:38.054 --> 26:40.849
Yeah... not weird. [laughs nervously]

26:40.932 --> 26:44.019
Um... CJ,

26:44.102 --> 26:46.688
I remember the first time I saw you.

26:47.897 --> 26:49.691
You were so beautiful.

26:51.901 --> 26:54.112
And you're even more beautiful now.

26:55.530 --> 27:00.243
I love you so much, I can't imagine
living a single day without you.

27:01.786 --> 27:02.954
CJ,

27:03.788 --> 27:05.040
will you marry me?

27:09.377 --> 27:10.378
Yes.

Yes! Yes!

Steve,

27:23.391 --> 27:24.559
that was so sweet.

27:25.226 --> 27:26.644
I meant every word she said.

27:28.021 --> 27:30.690
Oh, that makes more sense!

27:32.150 --> 27:33.318
Congratulations!

27:36.237 --> 27:37.155

-OK.

DJ,

27:49.292 --> 27:50.960
thanks for helping us out.

27:51.044 --> 27:52.420
Oh, you're welcome.

27:52.504 --> 27:55.632
Congratulations, you guys.
I'm so happy for you two.

28:01.346 --> 28:04.599
[Steph] OK, you happy couples,
let's get this party started.

28:04.682 --> 28:08.228
OK, it's almost midnight.
I am bored with my own anger.

28:10.730 --> 28:12.232
I need my Kimberlina.

Here I am, my Latin prince.

28:20.740 --> 28:23.660
Mi amor, you wore the dress!

28:23.743 --> 28:25.203
And you're right.

28:25.286 --> 28:26.246
It's hideous.

28:28.540 --> 28:30.041
Hey, Jimmy, I need to talk to you.

28:31.251 --> 28:34.504
You know, earlier tonight, you threw out
that whole "Let's have a baby" thing?

28:35.130 --> 28:36.047
[giggles]

28:36.464 --> 28:40.218
So... you should know
that I can't get pregnant.

28:40.301 --> 28:43.179
Oh. That's OK. Neither can I.

28:44.764 --> 28:47.308
Phew. Feels good to get that off my chest.

28:48.476 --> 28:50.603
I just wanna make sure
it's not a problem for you,

28:50.687 --> 28:54.065
because... you know,
if things work out between us, then...

28:54.149 --> 28:56.276
we're gonna have to
consider other options.

28:56.359 --> 28:57.527
Like adoption.

28:58.403 --> 29:00.864
All that matters to me
is that we're together.

29:00.947 --> 29:02.532
I love ya, Etch-A-Steph.

29:03.783 --> 29:05.326
I love you too, Jiminy Cricket.

29:07.996 --> 29:10.540
OK, it's almost midnight, here we go!

29:57.587 --> 29:59.380
You're not gonna try and kiss me?

30:00.006 --> 30:03.009
Nah, I don't need a kiss.
I'm just happy to be with you.

30:08.389 --> 30:10.225
Although a kiss is nice.

Wake up, everybody!

I'd like you to meet
the newest member of our family.

and no touching without hand sanitizer.

There's your Aunt Kimmy.

-Say hi to Aunt Stephanie.

31:20.003 --> 31:21.254
Aww...

31:22.755 --> 31:25.717
Wow. What a crazy night.

31:25.800 --> 31:28.720
I mean, I never thought I'd see DJ
down on her knee proposing.

31:28.803 --> 31:29.762
To a woman.

31:31.598 --> 31:33.766
But you're cool with Steve being engaged,

31:33.850 --> 31:37.020
because, you know, you were gonna
pick Matt last summer anyway, right?

31:37.812 --> 31:38.771
Well...

31:40.648 --> 31:42.692
Wait, were you gonna pick Steve?

31:43.568 --> 31:44.652
I was.

31:46.738 --> 31:47.780
[both] Whoa.

31:49.532 --> 31:52.035
I just thought that after all these years,

31:52.118 --> 31:54.412
we should see
if we were meant to be together.

31:55.538 --> 31:56.956
But it doesn't matter now.

I'm really happy with Matt.

Hey, baby.

Mmm.

this is gonna be our best year yet.
