-[narrator]<i> previously...</i>
-You're a real inspiration
around here.

00:03.704 --> 00:04.953
This is my big sis nova.

00:04.989 --> 00:06.188
You have quite a reputation.

00:06.207 --> 00:07.406
All good, I hope.

00:07.458 --> 00:08.907
I don't shy away
from bad either.

00:08.959 --> 00:11.960
I'm worried about you
falling so far behind
on your mortgage.

00:11.996 --> 00:14.529
Keke, I'm actually here
to take a class with
this photographer.

00:14.548 --> 00:16.031
-Farah stephens?
-Oh, you know his work?

00:16.050 --> 00:17.666
I run his nft account.

00:17.701 --> 00:19.468
It's been a long time
since I felt like this.

00:19.503 --> 00:21.820
-Are you asking me out?
-Get back in the car.

00:21.856 --> 00:23.355
You are not welcome here, sam.

00:23.391 --> 00:25.357
Parker's a living descendant
of the massacre.

00:25.393 --> 00:27.375
It's gonna take a lot more
than your pathetic daughter

00:27.395 --> 00:28.710
to overturn the marker.

00:28.729 --> 00:29.678
We'll see.

00:38.155 --> 00:40.239
Where did I put
that address book?

00:48.749 --> 00:50.082
You want to talk about it?

00:52.736 --> 00:54.820
We can't let parker
get away with this.

00:55.673 --> 00:56.655
[sighs]

00:58.075 --> 01:00.025
I don't believe
what sam said.

01:00.061 --> 01:03.078
Betty was my best friend,
a good person.

01:03.097 --> 01:06.715
She would never allow
her daughter or sam

01:06.750 --> 01:08.583
to do us wrong.

01:08.602 --> 01:14.556
Baby, that was a long time ago
and people change.

01:14.591 --> 01:17.276
And the bottom line is,
she is still parker's mother.

01:20.564 --> 01:21.780
When was the last time
you saw her?

01:25.236 --> 01:26.618
It's been a while.

01:27.604 --> 01:29.555
But I knew her.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.740
Hollywood, I knew her.

01:34.378 --> 01:35.627
I'm gonna find her.

02:26.163 --> 02:28.430
-Oh.
-Oh, I got it.

02:30.968 --> 02:34.469
All right, I messed up
a little bit, but at
least it didn't tear.

02:34.504 --> 02:36.104
We really gotta
get these digitized.

02:36.140 --> 02:37.439
Yeah,
before they're lost forever.

02:37.474 --> 02:38.557
Yeah.

02:38.592 --> 02:40.175
Never seen pops like that.

02:40.194 --> 02:42.311
[chuckles]

02:42.346 --> 02:43.645
-looks so young.
-Yeah.

02:44.832 --> 02:46.031
Younger than you.

02:47.151 --> 02:51.036
Now it's all lost
'cause of them.

02:52.790 --> 02:54.289
Still here, but now...

02:56.693 --> 02:58.177
It's all lost.

02:58.212 --> 03:00.245
It's not over.

03:00.281 --> 03:02.297
We are going to stop them
from overturning the landmark

03:02.333 --> 03:04.082
at the council meeting
tomorrow.

03:04.134 --> 03:07.319
Dominic's in baton rouge
meeting with the historical
preservation society.

03:07.354 --> 03:09.338
And I've reached out to all
of the living descendants.

03:11.158 --> 03:15.543
With all of us standing
shoulder to shoulder at
the city council meeting,

03:15.563 --> 03:17.012
we can stop parker and sam.

03:35.916 --> 03:38.867
This photo halted development
at congo square.

03:42.089 --> 03:44.823
This one reopened
an unsolved murder case.

03:49.913 --> 03:53.248
This photo was shared over
1 million times,

03:53.267 --> 03:55.183
brought in protesters
from across the world.

03:56.387 --> 03:58.720
Keke helped me
upload it as an nft.

03:58.755 --> 04:01.106
We sold it
for almost $100,000.

04:02.526 --> 04:04.893
I donated the proceeds
to the movement
for black lives.

04:06.780 --> 04:08.530
The value of an image.

04:10.534 --> 04:13.235
Is the one
with the dollar amount

04:13.270 --> 04:17.906
worth more than the
one that brought peace
to a grieving family?

04:22.279 --> 04:24.363
We can talk about the details
on nfts later.

04:24.398 --> 04:26.581
Right now,
let's just go over the basics.

04:26.616 --> 04:28.583
What is an nft?

04:28.618 --> 04:31.370
It stands
for non-fungible token.

04:31.405 --> 04:34.756
It's a one-of-a-kind piece
of digital art stored online,

04:34.791 --> 04:36.675
secured on the blockchain.

04:36.727 --> 04:41.463
Artists buy and sell nfts
to make a living all the time.

04:41.482 --> 04:47.269
But whatever value an image
may have comes first from you,
the photographer.

04:48.739 --> 04:54.026
All you have
to offer as artists
is your perspective.

04:54.078 --> 04:57.946
So, I want you all to show me
the world through your eyes.

05:01.085 --> 05:02.334
Show me you.

05:04.672 --> 05:08.790
The first nft was minted on
may 3rd, 2014.

05:09.993 --> 05:12.344
[indistinct chatter]

05:16.666 --> 05:20.469
hey, um,
so, how do I upload an nft?

05:21.522 --> 05:23.889
So, they're generally run
through aggregator sites

05:23.941 --> 05:27.142
with access to collectors
who pay top dollar.

05:27.177 --> 05:32.147
So, you think that
there's anyone that might be
interested in my work or...

05:33.016 --> 05:35.033
Keke introduce me to a guy,
zane.

05:36.036 --> 05:37.703
He's always sweating me
to post more.

05:39.689 --> 05:43.024
I'll be honest with you,
he's a little slippery.

05:43.043 --> 05:44.159
If you can handle it.

05:45.879 --> 05:46.995
Okay.

05:47.030 --> 05:48.113
Yeah. Thank you.

05:48.148 --> 05:49.464
-No problem.
-Thanks.

05:54.638 --> 05:55.754
Thank you.

05:55.806 --> 05:57.756
You need anything else?

05:57.808 --> 05:59.007
I'm good, son.

05:59.042 --> 06:01.259
Full as a tick.

06:01.311 --> 06:05.213
So, I hear you finally
asked sandy out on a date.

06:05.232 --> 06:06.848
I see you playa.

06:08.885 --> 06:10.102
Yeah.

06:10.154 --> 06:12.654
I got to do something special
for our first date.

06:12.689 --> 06:14.156
Yeah, yeah.
Don't stress that now.

06:14.191 --> 06:16.274
I'm sure she'll like
whatever you come up with.

06:16.326 --> 06:18.527
Just as long as
you two are together,
that's all that matters.

06:18.562 --> 06:19.995
Okay.
Well, this is a classy lady,

06:20.030 --> 06:22.447
and she's been to every fine
restaurant in new orleans.

06:22.499 --> 06:24.232
I can't take her
to just any place.

06:24.251 --> 06:25.900
What? Give me something
to work with.

06:25.919 --> 06:28.120
What does she like?
Where does she want to go?

06:28.172 --> 06:30.622
Well, she talks
about jamaica a lot.

06:30.674 --> 06:33.058
Well, there it is.
Jamaica it is.

06:33.093 --> 06:34.843
I can't afford
a trip to jamaica.

06:34.878 --> 06:36.845
But you can afford
a real spot.

06:36.880 --> 06:39.581
So, let's say we make that
into a jamaican paradise,

06:39.600 --> 06:41.800
palm trees, reggae music,
that vibe,

06:41.852 --> 06:44.352
make some jerk chicken
and rum cake.

06:44.388 --> 06:45.637
We're gonna
make that first date

06:45.689 --> 06:47.105
with sandy a night
to remember.

06:49.426 --> 06:51.759
Okay, jamaica in st. Joe.

06:51.779 --> 06:53.528
-I like it.
-Uh-huh.

06:53.564 --> 06:55.530
Rotating our crops lately.

06:55.566 --> 06:57.566
Practicing the george
washington carver method.

06:57.601 --> 06:59.434
Yeah, our soil nutrients
have doubled.

06:59.453 --> 07:02.237
Have y'all
considered aeroponics
in the greenhouse?

07:02.272 --> 07:04.406
It uses less water,
mostly air.

07:06.276 --> 07:08.493
Fifty years, never had
no problems with air.

07:08.545 --> 07:10.111
-[laughing]
-yeah.

07:10.130 --> 07:12.164
Well, it's the same concept
as the carver method,

07:12.216 --> 07:14.166
you just need the right amount
of nutrients.

07:14.218 --> 07:15.550
After we set up aeroponics,

07:15.586 --> 07:17.385
we doubled our yield
in one year.

07:17.421 --> 07:19.421
Wow. That's good.

07:19.456 --> 07:21.223
I have something
for y'all actually.

07:22.643 --> 07:23.809
Seeds from my land.

07:24.961 --> 07:26.428
From my mother's people.

07:26.463 --> 07:30.232
Plant them, save the seeds
so you can pass them
to the next generation.

07:30.267 --> 07:32.934
I hope they bring you luck for
the council meeting tomorrow.

07:32.969 --> 07:34.135
You've come a long way.

07:34.154 --> 07:35.937
Ain't happen overnight.

07:35.972 --> 07:37.072
Takes a village.

07:37.107 --> 07:39.140
Well, it's one
of the perks of a co-op.

07:39.159 --> 07:40.308
-Community, yeah?
-Right.

07:40.327 --> 07:43.411
-Mmm-hmm.
-You ready for your interview?

07:43.447 --> 07:44.529
Yeah, I am.

07:44.581 --> 07:47.148
Us farmers need
that star treatment too.

07:47.167 --> 07:48.783
Encourage folks
to get back to the land.

07:48.818 --> 07:50.869
-Heard that.
-How about we talk over lunch?

07:50.921 --> 07:52.287
How about over a drink?

07:52.322 --> 07:53.588
Even better.

07:55.325 --> 07:57.825
Well, it was lovely
seeing you again.

07:57.845 --> 07:59.461
-You as well.
-Prosper.

08:02.999 --> 08:04.633
Y'all don't need anything
from me?

08:04.668 --> 08:06.017
Nah, we're good.

08:07.855 --> 08:09.354
Y'all ladies have fun.

08:11.024 --> 08:12.440
[chuckles]

08:12.476 --> 08:13.825
where are we goin'?

08:17.847 --> 08:20.932
[pop music playing]

08:22.302 --> 08:24.319
[phone rings]

08:33.797 --> 08:35.497
last time I did that,

08:35.532 --> 08:37.666
he was at a cafe across
the street

08:37.701 --> 08:39.301
and saw me ignore the call.

08:42.139 --> 08:43.555
Well, he's in chicago.

08:44.708 --> 08:45.974
Mine's in new york.

08:46.009 --> 08:47.342
So, we should be safe then.

08:47.678 --> 08:48.727
[chuckles]

08:49.980 --> 08:51.379
I love your jacket.

08:51.398 --> 08:54.048
-You look great in it.
-Thank you.

08:54.067 --> 08:58.670
Listen, this might be tmi,
but when I was avoiding calls,
it didn't end well.

09:00.240 --> 09:04.225
Yeah, well,
it is definitely headed
in that direction.

09:04.244 --> 09:06.227
But I still love him.

09:06.246 --> 09:08.446
He's a great guy.
Always has been.

09:08.498 --> 09:09.864
It's the reason
why I chose him.

09:12.252 --> 09:14.169
Why am I telling you
my whole life story?

09:14.204 --> 09:15.537
-[laughs]
-I'm so sorry.

09:15.572 --> 09:19.007
Look, I say just rip off
the band-aid.

09:19.042 --> 09:21.209
It'll hurt at first,
then it'll get better.

09:22.379 --> 09:24.912
Yeah.
I'm just not sure
if I'm ready yet.

09:24.932 --> 09:26.214
You don't know until you try.

09:28.719 --> 09:30.135
Call him.

09:30.187 --> 09:31.353
Hi. I'm billie denton.

09:32.922 --> 09:34.889
My mother calls me
my emani.

09:34.924 --> 09:36.758
That's a beautiful name.

09:36.777 --> 09:38.360
It's really nice to meet you,
emani.

09:38.395 --> 09:40.145
Great meeting you too, billie.

09:40.197 --> 09:41.563
Make the call.

09:41.598 --> 09:43.114
I'm thinking. I'm thinking.

09:45.369 --> 09:47.869
[phone rings]

09:54.895 --> 09:57.795
yeah, this is my idea
of montego bay
vibes right here.

09:57.814 --> 09:59.347
And this one gives you what?

09:59.399 --> 10:01.566
Hedonism. 1999.

10:01.602 --> 10:03.602
-Oh, dear.
-Ocho rios.

10:03.637 --> 10:05.737
Oh, oh. I found it.
Look at this.

10:05.772 --> 10:07.972
Oh, here we go. Yes.

10:07.991 --> 10:09.691
Oh.

10:09.743 --> 10:11.309
Boom! Boom!

10:11.328 --> 10:12.777
[in jamaican accent]
how do I look, man?

10:12.812 --> 10:14.446
Keep the hat,
but lose the accent.

10:14.481 --> 10:16.081
-Don't do me like that,
prosper.
-[prosper] oh.

10:16.116 --> 10:18.583
Come on now. [laughs]

10:19.836 --> 10:20.952
yeah.

10:20.987 --> 10:22.587
Thanks again for everything,
wood.

10:22.623 --> 10:24.706
There's no way I could have
done this all by myself.

10:24.758 --> 10:27.292
We're just so glad that
sandra make you so happy.

10:27.327 --> 10:28.843
Do anything
to keep that going.

10:32.015 --> 10:33.131
[sighs]

10:34.434 --> 10:35.917
you know,
that's always a good thing

10:35.952 --> 10:38.803
when you got two good people
and they into each other.

10:40.190 --> 10:43.558
Sometimes you just got
to dig deep, go through it.

10:43.610 --> 10:46.611
But when you do, there's
nothing better than love.

10:46.647 --> 10:48.012
Mmm-hmm.

10:48.031 --> 10:49.347
Yeah, you're right about that.

10:49.366 --> 10:51.015
It's about time
you got off the market.

10:51.034 --> 10:52.350
No more flying solo.

10:52.369 --> 10:53.635
Oh. Yeah.

10:53.670 --> 10:56.504
I've been solo
for a long time.

10:56.540 --> 10:58.356
I kind of got used
to being alone.

10:58.375 --> 11:00.408
Oh, man.
Nobody needs to be alone.

11:00.460 --> 11:02.811
Sometimes it just
takes a moment
to find your better half.

11:02.846 --> 11:06.831
Look, I tried for a long time,
but I found my queen.

11:06.866 --> 11:08.667
Claire was my better half.

11:08.702 --> 11:09.834
Yeah.

11:09.869 --> 11:11.419
The only woman I ever loved.

11:11.471 --> 11:13.705
Thought it was forever.

11:13.724 --> 11:16.758
Didn't think I'd need
to be out here looking again.

11:16.810 --> 11:18.143
I was a little rusty.

11:18.178 --> 11:21.713
You know, back then,
it didn't have to be smooth,

11:21.732 --> 11:23.381
know the right words
to say it,

11:23.400 --> 11:26.334
just being me was enough.

11:26.370 --> 11:27.885
No, it still is.

11:27.904 --> 11:30.605
Hey, being real
is never going out of style.

11:30.657 --> 11:32.357
Well, I hope you're right

11:33.994 --> 11:35.527
'cause I'm sweet on sandy.

11:39.065 --> 11:40.865
I was born into it.

11:40.900 --> 11:42.667
Both sides
of my family were farmers,

11:42.703 --> 11:43.868
cherokee and african.

11:45.038 --> 11:47.872
From day one,
all I ever wanted to do.

11:49.009 --> 11:52.010
Take care of the land,
it takes care of us.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.294
You native american?

11:53.346 --> 11:55.180
Both. And neither.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.581
Depending on who you talk to.

11:56.600 --> 11:58.550
Not black enough
or indian enough for some.

11:59.720 --> 12:01.436
I don't always fit in either.

12:03.523 --> 12:06.024
That little pouch
that you gave my brother
of the seeds,

12:07.394 --> 12:09.728
that's a beautiful way
to honor your mother.

12:09.763 --> 12:11.613
The seeds remember
the land they came from.

12:12.883 --> 12:13.982
My mother used
to tell us about

12:14.017 --> 12:17.101
how girls would braid rice
and okra into the hair

12:17.120 --> 12:20.205
when they were stolen
from africa to remember home.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.322
Yeah.

12:21.374 --> 12:24.042
Lots of african plants
and crops were here

12:24.077 --> 12:26.044
in the americas
because of those women.

12:27.214 --> 12:30.048
You know, our mother would
tell us the story

12:30.083 --> 12:32.083
of when her people
were removed from their land,

12:32.118 --> 12:34.219
they took their seeds
with them to oklahoma,

12:34.254 --> 12:36.087
but the crops
wouldn't grow there.

12:36.122 --> 12:38.757
And the white settlers' food
wasn't growing here either,

12:38.792 --> 12:42.677
so the white people begged
our people for seeds to grow

12:42.729 --> 12:45.013
food and survive, right?

12:45.065 --> 12:48.650
Our people deliberated
and ultimately
they shared them.

12:50.153 --> 12:54.806
But you see, the seeds needed
to be in their soil,

12:54.825 --> 12:57.609
where they came
from in order to survive.

12:57.644 --> 12:58.777
Mmm-hmm.

12:59.946 --> 13:01.279
I feel that.

13:01.314 --> 13:02.914
[phone buzzes]

13:08.455 --> 13:11.322
so true story, nova,

13:11.341 --> 13:14.659
you got someone tending
your garden at home
waiting on you?

13:14.678 --> 13:15.960
Well, not at the moment.

13:16.797 --> 13:18.429
He's out of town.
But yeah, I do.

13:20.183 --> 13:21.466
You?

13:23.336 --> 13:25.169
I'm still looking.

13:25.188 --> 13:26.471
But good for you.

13:31.645 --> 13:33.278
Hmm.

13:33.313 --> 13:34.846
Okay, shall we?

13:34.865 --> 13:35.980
What you got?

13:36.015 --> 13:37.615
What inspired you
to start your co-op?

13:39.369 --> 13:42.153
[indistinct music
playing in background]

13:49.045 --> 13:50.328
[man] it's gorgeous, isn't it?

13:52.883 --> 13:54.182
Yeah.

13:55.552 --> 13:58.169
Hey, while I have you,

13:58.204 --> 13:59.838
I wanted to show you
some of my photos

13:59.873 --> 14:02.140
for the art show
for end of the summer?

14:02.175 --> 14:04.259
Sure.
Let's see what you got.

14:04.311 --> 14:06.227
Working hard on some stuff,
you know?

14:10.233 --> 14:11.816
Hmm.

14:11.852 --> 14:13.351
Some of my recent stuff.

14:14.404 --> 14:16.387
-Mostly black and white.
-Mmm.

14:16.406 --> 14:17.889
I like it.

14:17.908 --> 14:19.157
I see you coming through.

14:20.660 --> 14:22.527
-This is nice work, michael.
-Thank you.

14:23.663 --> 14:25.730
I really want to be
a part of the art show.

14:25.749 --> 14:26.831
You should talk to keke.

14:26.867 --> 14:28.366
She's curating.

14:28.401 --> 14:30.067
Oh.

14:30.086 --> 14:31.536
Oh, I didn't know.

14:33.239 --> 14:34.539
I...

14:35.842 --> 14:37.375
I don't know
if she told you, but--

14:37.410 --> 14:39.210
yeah, she told me.

14:39.245 --> 14:40.678
She's the boss.

14:40.714 --> 14:42.013
So, you got to weigh in.

14:43.850 --> 14:45.049
See you in class.

14:56.112 --> 14:58.613
You're looking like a cat
that swallowed a canary.

14:59.766 --> 15:00.865
Well, I don't want to brag,

15:00.901 --> 15:04.035
but we did sell out
all of my pies today.

15:04.070 --> 15:06.487
Yeah, there were a lot
of tourists in here today,

15:06.539 --> 15:07.772
but the rest of them?

15:07.791 --> 15:12.994
Nah, they like real butter,
cream, and sugar.

15:13.046 --> 15:15.446
No substitutes, baby.

15:15.465 --> 15:18.633
Substitutes can be tasty
if you know what you're doing.

15:20.720 --> 15:22.086
I can show you a few tricks.

15:25.225 --> 15:27.058
All right, mr. I can show you.

15:28.979 --> 15:32.063
You can help me whip up
a jamaican feast

15:32.098 --> 15:33.564
for prosper's big date.

15:37.971 --> 15:40.104
We'll see. [chuckles]

15:40.974 --> 15:43.024
plantains are my specialty.

15:43.076 --> 15:44.242
My mom taught me.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.310
Did you tell her
that I asked about her?

15:46.329 --> 15:47.445
How is she?

15:49.282 --> 15:50.415
She's good.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.250
Just busy working.

15:54.654 --> 15:56.337
You would tell me
if there was a problem, right?

15:57.607 --> 15:58.773
Of course.

16:00.677 --> 16:02.293
I'm gonna see
if anyone needs anything.

16:12.806 --> 16:14.889
Well, I don't know
what happened, parthena,

16:14.941 --> 16:17.892
but I don't have any record
of you ever filing
an extension.

16:17.944 --> 16:20.478
Please check
your records again.

16:20.513 --> 16:23.448
Miss parthena filed
more than three months ago.

16:23.483 --> 16:25.566
But she hasn't received
the extension.

16:25.618 --> 16:27.285
Sorry, I can't help you.

16:27.320 --> 16:30.488
Mr. Miller, I put that
application in your hand.

16:30.523 --> 16:31.990
You told me I was good to go.

16:32.025 --> 16:33.825
I don't recall that.

16:33.860 --> 16:34.993
You got a receipt?

16:35.028 --> 16:38.079
You know you ain't
never gave me a receipt.

16:38.131 --> 16:39.998
Not in the 35 years
I've been coming in here.

16:43.503 --> 16:47.138
Miss parthena's usda funds,

16:47.173 --> 16:49.090
they haven't
come through either.

16:49.142 --> 16:50.708
That's why she's been
late with her payments.

16:50.727 --> 16:52.677
Yeah, well,
those funds are tied up

16:52.712 --> 16:55.513
because of the lawsuit
from the white farmers.

16:55.548 --> 16:58.316
You know, it's just not fair
to give folks something

16:58.351 --> 16:59.550
because of their race.

16:59.569 --> 17:01.903
That's reverse discrimination.

17:03.890 --> 17:07.041
Never stopped them from
giving the white farmers
everything they need.

17:07.077 --> 17:11.696
And that lawsuit affects
usda loans, not extensions.

17:14.567 --> 17:17.168
All right.
Well, I'll tell you
what I can do.

17:17.203 --> 17:21.005
Now, I know some folks
that would be very interested
in buying that land of yours.

17:21.041 --> 17:22.356
Okay. He's not gonna help us.

17:22.392 --> 17:24.258
Just hold on a second.

17:25.712 --> 17:28.212
And because I've known you
for nearly 40 years,

17:28.247 --> 17:30.548
I'm gonna make you
an exception.

17:30.583 --> 17:34.902
You get that payment
into this office
within 48 hours,

17:34.938 --> 17:36.921
this whole matter
will be settled.

17:36.940 --> 17:39.891
Where am I gonna
get $25,000 by Monday?

17:41.611 --> 17:43.411
We'll be in touch.

17:43.446 --> 17:44.779
Let's go, miss parthena.

17:48.785 --> 17:50.234
I'll meet you guys in the car.

17:56.275 --> 17:57.942
Excuse me.

17:57.961 --> 17:59.110
You were listening in there.

17:59.129 --> 18:00.545
Yes, I was.

18:02.048 --> 18:03.414
Anything
you can do to help us?

18:04.417 --> 18:06.717
I wish I could,
but it's not my case.

18:06.753 --> 18:08.252
Miller takes
all the black farmers.

18:09.622 --> 18:11.789
He's been slowing down
the process.

18:11.808 --> 18:13.341
-He's waiting out the clock.
-You're right.

18:13.393 --> 18:15.760
Look. Call me.

18:15.795 --> 18:17.461
I can't talk freely here.

18:17.480 --> 18:20.681
Files get lodged with
miller when it comes
to the black farmers.

18:20.717 --> 18:22.299
And he said 48 hours,

18:22.318 --> 18:24.769
but if you could
come up with the money,

18:24.804 --> 18:26.020
best to do it now.

18:26.072 --> 18:28.573
I heard him talking
to the sheriff earlier.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.141
He's not to be trusted.

18:30.160 --> 18:31.776
So be careful.

18:31.811 --> 18:33.111
Give me a call.

18:42.438 --> 18:44.205
Ever been
a friend of black farmers.

18:44.240 --> 18:46.407
Every interview I've done,
miller's name comes up.

18:46.442 --> 18:48.326
Is he the only rep
at the local usda?

18:48.361 --> 18:50.328
Mr. Randolph told me he claims

18:50.380 --> 18:52.730
all the black farm cases
personally.

18:52.765 --> 18:55.166
Easier to control
the system that way.

18:55.218 --> 18:58.336
I know I put that extension
in his hands.

18:58.388 --> 19:00.287
-I swear.
-We believe you.

19:00.306 --> 19:02.507
First, it was ralph angel.
Now this.

19:02.559 --> 19:04.392
The vultures are circling.

19:04.427 --> 19:06.727
If the council votes
to overturn our landmark,

19:06.763 --> 19:07.895
our home is gone.

19:07.931 --> 19:10.598
I got to come up
with $25,000 by Monday.

19:11.451 --> 19:13.067
Otherwise,
I'm gonna lose my farm.

19:13.102 --> 19:14.902
You're not gonna lose
your farm, miss parthena.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.272
If we pool together
all our settlement money,

19:19.576 --> 19:21.809
chip in a little bit
more each,

19:21.828 --> 19:23.811
we can make that payment.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.279
We're not going out
like that this time.

19:26.583 --> 19:27.665
That's my word.

19:29.919 --> 19:31.118
Thank you.

19:39.179 --> 19:42.797
[music playing indistinctly
in background]

19:48.337 --> 19:49.770
uh, excuse me.

19:49.806 --> 19:51.439
Hi. Sorry to interrupt.

19:51.474 --> 19:52.974
I'm looking for zane.

19:53.009 --> 19:54.275
Beige jacket by the shark.

19:54.310 --> 19:55.476
All right. Thank you.

20:04.370 --> 20:05.736
Hey.

20:05.788 --> 20:07.238
Hey.

20:07.290 --> 20:08.656
You must be keke's friend.

20:08.691 --> 20:10.958
Yeah, man. Michael west.

20:10.994 --> 20:12.243
Full disclosure.

20:12.295 --> 20:14.361
I've been a davis west fan
since he first got
in the league.

20:14.380 --> 20:15.529
-Oh, man.
-Yeah.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.748
-Old man was a beast.
-Hey, man. No lies detected.

20:17.800 --> 20:18.966
Yeah.

20:19.002 --> 20:20.167
-I'ma show you around.
-All right.

20:21.537 --> 20:25.039
We're printing out
a few of our favorite
nfts for the walls.

20:25.058 --> 20:29.844
But most of the art lives
in there, in the blockchain.

20:31.547 --> 20:33.180
We only acquire what sells.

20:33.215 --> 20:35.549
And if we bring you
into the ivory nft art show,

20:35.568 --> 20:37.985
you need to sell
and keep selling,

20:38.021 --> 20:39.770
otherwise you're dead weight.

20:39.822 --> 20:40.855
Want a drink?

20:40.890 --> 20:42.657
Yeah, please.

20:42.692 --> 20:43.858
It's got adaptogens.

20:46.246 --> 20:48.779
No booze until the sun sets,
then all bets are off.

20:48.831 --> 20:52.399
All right,
so how do I get into this?

20:52.418 --> 20:57.071
This overprivileged,
totally entitled crew

20:57.090 --> 20:58.739
works on crypto tokens.

20:58.758 --> 21:00.174
-Okay.
-Good vibes.

21:01.243 --> 21:02.677
We're aggregators.

21:02.712 --> 21:04.962
People come to us
because they know
we have real artists.

21:05.014 --> 21:07.748
I mean, here I am.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.750
-Oh, yeah? All right.
-[laughs]

21:09.769 --> 21:11.519
well, first, I need
to take a look at your work.

21:11.554 --> 21:13.187
If it's a fit,
we'll go from there.

21:13.222 --> 21:14.639
-Sounds good.
-My man.

21:14.691 --> 21:15.756
-Let's do it.
-Let's do it.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.525
-Very good to meet you.
-Nice to meet you as well.

21:17.560 --> 21:18.643
-Yeah.
-All right.

21:18.695 --> 21:20.061
-Peace.
-See you.

21:31.774 --> 21:32.873
Mercy.

21:32.909 --> 21:36.227
Looks like
the whole parish turned out.

21:36.262 --> 21:38.946
They think numbers
will make the difference.

21:38.965 --> 21:41.281
We can't afford
a setback here.

21:41.301 --> 21:42.950
We got too much
riding on this.

21:42.969 --> 21:45.119
We'll get them to overturn
the landmark

21:45.138 --> 21:46.921
and finally get the land.

21:46.956 --> 21:48.422
Just let me do my job.

21:57.734 --> 21:59.967
Your mother would be
ashamed of you, baby.

21:59.986 --> 22:02.687
You have no idea
what my mother wants.

22:02.739 --> 22:05.089
All you had to do was get
your nephew to take the deal.

22:05.124 --> 22:06.440
You didn't.

22:06.475 --> 22:08.826
So it's my land now, violet.

22:10.296 --> 22:13.114
I don't give a good goddamn
whose daughter you are.

22:13.149 --> 22:15.149
You watch your tone with me.

22:15.168 --> 22:16.951
I say
let's just go find a seat.

22:18.421 --> 22:19.754
Vi.

22:19.789 --> 22:22.957
I hope your family
is prepared to accept
the council's ruling.

22:22.992 --> 22:24.291
I know we are.

22:28.147 --> 22:29.413
Sam...

22:30.850 --> 22:34.001
Not much is ever in our favor,
never has been.

22:34.020 --> 22:35.519
And we are still here.

22:38.458 --> 22:39.840
We're still fighting.

22:39.859 --> 22:41.392
And we never give up.

22:41.444 --> 22:43.611
You should know that by now.

22:43.646 --> 22:44.945
Come on, daddy.

22:50.370 --> 22:53.654
[people murmuring]

22:57.043 --> 23:01.195
welcome. We're here today
to vote on a proposal

23:01.214 --> 23:05.699
from landry enterprises
to develop an outlet mall
on their land.

23:05.718 --> 23:09.920
This would mean overturning
a historical landmark.

23:09.972 --> 23:13.641
Speaking for the opposition,
nova bordelon.

23:14.977 --> 23:16.343
We'll hear from her now.

23:23.236 --> 23:27.188
This land needs
to remain untouched.

23:27.223 --> 23:28.939
It is the final resting place

23:28.991 --> 23:30.541
for the victims
of the thibodaux massacre.

23:33.896 --> 23:37.031
But it is also my family home,

23:39.902 --> 23:41.168
our home.

23:44.173 --> 23:46.040
My ancestors,

23:46.075 --> 23:48.709
our ancestors have endured
enough suffering in life.

23:50.046 --> 23:54.515
In death, we need to allow
them to rest in peace.

23:54.550 --> 23:56.884
The land was designated
a historical landmark

23:56.919 --> 23:58.052
by the state.

23:59.222 --> 24:01.021
I ask that
the council respect that

24:02.225 --> 24:04.225
and not allow it
to be destroyed for greed.

24:05.561 --> 24:07.228
If we do not honor our past,

24:08.781 --> 24:10.064
we dishonor our future.

24:11.734 --> 24:13.267
Thank you.

24:13.286 --> 24:16.787
[all applauding]

24:23.546 --> 24:24.745
thank you, ms. Bordelon.

24:26.716 --> 24:28.215
And miss campbell.

24:38.060 --> 24:40.427
I too have ancestors
buried on my land.

24:41.564 --> 24:43.764
I too share the pain
of their suffering.

24:45.434 --> 24:48.185
I want to honor those
brave souls

24:48.237 --> 24:50.738
and have them disinterred
and given a proper burial.

24:55.411 --> 24:58.445
This locket was given
to me by my mother.

24:59.982 --> 25:02.032
It was my grandmother's.

25:02.084 --> 25:06.203
She always told me
to remember my ancestors.

25:06.255 --> 25:07.671
And that is what
I am determined to do.

25:09.592 --> 25:13.160
I would be remiss
if I didn't acknowledge
the council

25:13.179 --> 25:15.346
for giving me this opportunity
to speak.

25:18.334 --> 25:19.767
I agree with miss bordelon.

25:21.187 --> 25:23.854
We honor
the past and the future.

25:29.362 --> 25:30.978
[tearfully] excuse me.

25:35.017 --> 25:37.868
We share a deep commitment
to both.

25:42.875 --> 25:46.460
I want to bring life
back to st. Joe.

25:51.133 --> 25:55.920
This development
will create hundreds of jobs,

25:55.972 --> 25:57.805
boosting a weak economy.

25:59.725 --> 26:03.677
It is my honor to bring this
to my mother's hometown.

26:05.848 --> 26:07.147
Thank you for your time.

26:09.018 --> 26:11.352
[all applauding]

26:17.726 --> 26:22.780
st. Joe needs
a financial lift.

26:22.832 --> 26:25.366
Our business community took
a hit due to covid,

26:25.401 --> 26:28.035
and we need
to get back on track.

26:28.070 --> 26:30.120
I move for a vote.

26:30.172 --> 26:33.891
All in favor of keeping
the historical landmark,

26:33.926 --> 26:35.209
raise your hand.

26:49.258 --> 26:52.242
All in favor of removing
the landmark

26:53.779 --> 26:57.231
and going forward
with the landry
development project,

26:58.234 --> 26:59.599

27:18.638 --> 27:20.387
The development
will move forward.

27:21.590 --> 27:23.057
The meeting is adjourned.

27:28.431 --> 27:29.930
Did you call him?

27:42.828 --> 27:44.144
The hell is wrong with you?

27:44.163 --> 27:45.696
Like I said,

27:45.748 --> 27:48.666
just trying to bring life
back to a dying town.

27:49.285 --> 27:50.317

Oh, baby, we ain't giving up.

28:24.720 --> 28:27.221

to restore and rest up
