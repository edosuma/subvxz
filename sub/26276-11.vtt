But let's say,
from now on,

34:27.152 --> 34:29.545
you stick to going after missing
cats instead of missing nukes.

34:29.589 --> 34:31.982
I don't choose my clients.
They choose me.

34:32.026 --> 34:33.462
Well, then, you should do
a better job screening them.

34:33.506 --> 34:35.290
[chuckles]:
Agreed.

34:35.334 --> 34:38.163
Hey, thanks for trusting me.

34:38.206 --> 34:40.643
Don't get used to it.
Today was a one-off.

34:40.687 --> 34:43.124
MAGNUM:
Yeah.

34:43.168 --> 34:45.692
I'm winning him over.

34:57.051 --> 34:59.619
[sighs]
I'm sorry.

34:59.662 --> 35:02.491
Well, let's just hope
that your government

35:02.535 --> 35:05.190
has the wisdom not to use it.

35:09.672 --> 35:12.284
Yeah. You all right?

35:12.327 --> 35:15.591
I'm not sure.

35:15.635 --> 35:18.768
I always thought
one day I'd go home.

35:18.812 --> 35:22.816
But Katya was my only family.

35:22.859 --> 35:25.384
I really don't have
anything to return to.

35:25.427 --> 35:27.168
I guess...

35:27.212 --> 35:30.476
Hawaii's my new home.

35:30.519 --> 35:33.479
You know, a really good friend
of mine told me

35:33.522 --> 35:35.698
that the beef khashlama at Orel

35:35.742 --> 35:38.266
is just
insanely good.

35:38.310 --> 35:40.703
[laughs softly]
Your friend is right.

35:40.747 --> 35:43.619
I've never tried it before,
but, I don't know,

35:43.663 --> 35:46.056
maybe we could get together
next week, grab some lunch.

35:46.100 --> 35:47.493
I could give it a shot.

35:48.885 --> 35:50.452
I'd like that.

35:50.496 --> 35:52.280
Me, too.

36:01.202 --> 36:03.422
Oh.
Hi.

36:03.465 --> 36:05.641
Chef said you
wanted to see me?

36:05.685 --> 36:07.687
Yes, thanks. Um,

36:07.730 --> 36:12.213
I, I just wanted
to check you're okay.

36:12.257 --> 36:14.389
I'm fine. Why?

36:14.433 --> 36:17.305
Well, I suppose
because the first time

36:17.349 --> 36:19.699
I went through an ordeal like
the one the other day, um...

36:19.742 --> 36:21.831
Must be old hat to you by now.

36:21.875 --> 36:24.486
Maybe, but I'll never forget
the first time

36:24.530 --> 36:26.184
someone pulled a gun on me.

36:26.227 --> 36:28.621
It was in Kiev.

36:28.664 --> 36:32.842
My second assignment for MI6.

36:32.886 --> 36:34.670
It was terrifying.

36:34.714 --> 36:36.368
He had this, uh,

36:36.411 --> 36:41.024
cheap revolver pointed
right in my face.

36:41.068 --> 36:42.635
I remember being able to see

36:42.678 --> 36:45.115
directly down the barrel
of the gun.

36:45.159 --> 36:46.204
What happened?

36:47.727 --> 36:49.729
Oh, that's not important.

36:50.947 --> 36:52.732
What is important is, um,

36:52.775 --> 36:55.125
what happened after that,
once I got home.

36:55.169 --> 36:56.388
You broke down?

36:56.431 --> 36:59.652
Quite the opposite. I buried it.

36:59.695 --> 37:01.654
So deep.

37:01.697 --> 37:03.960
I tried to forget
that it had ever happened.

37:04.004 --> 37:06.615
Which is the absolute
worst thing

37:06.659 --> 37:08.095
I could have done, of course.

37:10.619 --> 37:14.057
Just 'cause you bury something
doesn't mean it's gone.

37:14.101 --> 37:16.364
Very true.

37:16.408 --> 37:21.630
Anyway, my point is that if you
ever want to talk about it,

37:21.674 --> 37:24.807
I'm here, any time.

37:24.851 --> 37:28.246
That's very human of you.

37:29.682 --> 37:34.687
I know I can, uh, sometimes
come across rather cold.

37:34.730 --> 37:36.689
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean...No, no.

37:36.732 --> 37:38.386
No, it's okay. It's okay.

37:38.430 --> 37:40.432
[laughs softly]

37:40.475 --> 37:42.869
God knows,
the accent doesn't help.

37:44.827 --> 37:47.787
Truth is, it's been
an easy way for me

37:47.830 --> 37:50.703
to keep people
at an arm's length.

37:52.661 --> 37:56.839
But I'm trying to do that...
less.

37:58.058 --> 38:01.104
I think people
can pretty much do anything,

38:01.148 --> 38:02.889
with a little practice.

38:02.932 --> 38:05.457
Me, too.

38:05.500 --> 38:08.721
Anyway, I appreciate the offer.

38:08.764 --> 38:10.897
Hopefully, I don't have
to take you up on it.

38:10.940 --> 38:12.594
Me, too. Hopefully not.

38:12.638 --> 38:14.248
Well, I have to get back.All right.

38:14.292 --> 38:15.423
Enjoy your run.

38:15.467 --> 38:17.947
Thanks.
Hmm.

38:20.776 --> 38:24.911
Thank you, Juliet,
for everything.

38:26.652 --> 38:28.436
You're welcome.

38:28.480 --> 38:30.830
[laughs softly]

38:36.966 --> 38:39.099
MAGNUM:
Turns out, my dad was right.

38:39.142 --> 38:42.232
Reaching goals does
require sacrifice,

38:42.276 --> 38:44.670
but so does doing something
for the greater good.

38:44.713 --> 38:47.020
Sergei and his cousin
were ordinary people

38:47.063 --> 38:49.239
who made
extraordinary sacrifices

38:49.283 --> 38:51.241
in order to do the right thing.

38:51.285 --> 38:54.244
And no one outside of a few
people will ever really know.

38:54.288 --> 38:57.726
As sacrifices go, they don't
get more noble than that.

38:57.770 --> 39:00.381
[Zeus and Apollo barking]Rematch, Magnum?

39:00.425 --> 39:02.296
Rematch? We've never
officially raced.

39:02.340 --> 39:05.517
Oh, yeah, that's
right. You quit.

39:05.560 --> 39:08.041
[panting]:
Here.

39:08.084 --> 39:11.044
You ever think that, I don't
know, maybe racing is more about

39:11.087 --> 39:15.396
pushing yourself and less
about beating somebody else?

39:15.440 --> 39:18.486
No, I don't, and neither do you.

39:18.530 --> 39:19.835
We both know that
the whole point

39:19.879 --> 39:21.576
of competing is to try and win.

39:21.620 --> 39:23.404
Hmm. Intriguing prospect.

39:23.448 --> 39:25.537
You want to make this run
a little more fun?

39:25.580 --> 39:28.061
How about we race to that
lifeguard tower over there?

39:28.104 --> 39:30.411
Okay. Sounds good.

39:30.455 --> 39:32.631
What's in it for the winner?

39:32.674 --> 39:34.502
Bragging rights.I already have those

39:34.546 --> 39:35.938
from our last race.Whatever.

39:35.982 --> 39:37.418
Just name your stakes.

39:37.462 --> 39:42.510
Okay. If I win,

39:42.554 --> 39:46.122
you cannot ask a single favor
of me for an entire month.

39:46.166 --> 39:47.297
Four weeks?

39:47.341 --> 39:49.169
Yes, that constitutes
a month, Magnum.

39:49.212 --> 39:51.519
I'll do two weeks.Ah, you're that certain
you're gonna lose?

39:51.563 --> 39:53.434
[laughs]:
No, I'm gonna win.Right.

39:53.478 --> 39:54.435
Four weeks, then.

39:54.479 --> 39:56.481
Yeah.

39:56.524 --> 39:57.525
Okay.

39:57.569 --> 39:58.918
All right.

39:58.961 --> 40:02.487
On one.Ready.

40:02.530 --> 40:03.705
Three...

40:05.228 --> 40:06.273
...two...

40:09.145 --> 40:10.103
Cheater!

40:10.146 --> 40:11.104
Sore loser!
