LIAM:
Hey, hey. Buttons?

00:08.399 --> 00:09.835
Or no buttons?

00:09.879 --> 00:11.489
I know it's the first day
of your movie shooting,

00:11.533 --> 00:14.710
but you do know you're not
actually in the movie, right?

00:14.753 --> 00:16.190
But I still want to
wear the right thing.

00:16.233 --> 00:17.930
You know, something
that says "cool but...

00:17.974 --> 00:19.932
you know, brainy
Hollywood screenwriter."

00:19.976 --> 00:21.543
I wouldn't even know
where to start with that.

00:21.586 --> 00:24.024
But buttons make it seem
like you're trying too hard

00:24.067 --> 00:25.242
on your first day of school.

00:26.287 --> 00:27.853
I can't believe this
is finally happening.

00:27.897 --> 00:29.681
I mean, they're really
making a movie of my book!

00:29.725 --> 00:31.292
I know. It's
gonna be amazing,

00:31.335 --> 00:34.208
just like the cool
yet brainy writer behind it.

00:34.251 --> 00:37.298
Plus, you've got Janelle Crowley
playing me. It's perfect.

00:37.341 --> 00:39.517
I hope so. I sent her a flower
arrangement for good luck.[phone chimes]

00:39.561 --> 00:41.867
Sounds a little unimaginative
now that I think about it.

00:41.911 --> 00:44.827
Oh, my God.
My mother is insane.

00:44.870 --> 00:47.743
I cannot wait until her
partnership with Adam implodes.

00:47.786 --> 00:48.961
They're already fighting?

00:49.005 --> 00:50.224
No, she's just blowing up
my phone.

00:50.267 --> 00:52.008
She's sending me articles
about Alexam.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.575
Apparently, sales are "brisk"

00:53.618 --> 00:54.967
and she wants to make sure
to share that news with me.

00:55.011 --> 00:57.535
Well, here's an idea:
share that news

00:57.579 --> 00:59.798
with your business partner.

00:59.842 --> 01:01.800
Sorry. Now back to you.

01:01.844 --> 01:03.150
You know it's cliché

01:03.193 --> 01:05.413
to have an affair
with the lead actress.

01:05.456 --> 01:06.631
Should I be worried?

01:06.675 --> 01:08.459
[phone chimes, buzzes]

01:08.503 --> 01:11.071
I only have eyes
for the real Fallon.

01:11.114 --> 01:14.161
In fact, let's ignore our
phones, try to make a baby.

01:14.204 --> 01:15.901
I mean, I've got 20 minutes
before I have to leave.

01:15.945 --> 01:18.382
Plus, it'll cure my
first-day jitters.

01:18.426 --> 01:20.819
Oh. I have a meeting
I can't be late for.

01:20.863 --> 01:22.299
The board is reviewing
my proposal

01:22.343 --> 01:23.866
to turn our facilities
eco-friendly.

01:23.909 --> 01:25.737
Once they approve,
our offices

01:25.781 --> 01:27.739
will be greener
than Kermit the Frog.

01:27.783 --> 01:30.786
Plus, Baby Carrington
will have a healthier planet.

01:30.829 --> 01:32.875
And now I have 19 minutes.

01:33.876 --> 01:35.356
Okay. But skip the foreplay.

01:35.399 --> 01:37.401
Not a problem.

01:40.100 --> 01:43.277
[chiming, buzzing]

01:43.320 --> 01:44.278
SAM:
So?

01:44.321 --> 01:45.583
What did you think?

01:45.627 --> 01:47.890
Uh, that was quite
a breakfast, Sam.

01:47.933 --> 01:50.719
I didn't know something called
"grits" could be so tasty.

01:50.762 --> 01:52.938
Cornmeal and butter--
you can't go wrong.

01:52.982 --> 01:54.940
Plus, I wanted to cook you
a big Southern breakfast

01:54.984 --> 01:56.942
for finishing
your chemo treatments.

01:56.986 --> 01:58.466
You're cancer-free.
We should celebrate.

01:58.509 --> 01:59.771
Isn't that what we're doing?

01:59.815 --> 02:01.382
No, this is just breakfast.

02:01.425 --> 02:03.601
I thought we could do some
father-and-son bonding today.

02:03.645 --> 02:04.950
American-style.

02:04.994 --> 02:06.213
Do you like watching sports?

02:06.256 --> 02:07.779
Eh, prefer to play.

02:07.823 --> 02:09.085
Mostly fútbol.

02:09.129 --> 02:10.173
Mm.

02:10.217 --> 02:11.435
Don't you have a hotel to run?

02:11.479 --> 02:13.045
It seems very busy
at La Mirage.

02:13.089 --> 02:14.656
Nah. Don't worry about me.

02:14.699 --> 02:16.223
The place
practically runs itself.

02:16.266 --> 02:18.399
And I'm only a call away
if there's a problem.

02:18.442 --> 02:20.531
My flight to Caracas
is in a couple of days,

02:20.575 --> 02:22.316
and I need to wrap business
up here with the horses.

02:22.359 --> 02:23.795
I'm sorry,

02:23.839 --> 02:25.884
but we can catch a
game next time. Okay?

02:25.928 --> 02:28.235
Uh, yeah, yeah. Of course.

02:28.278 --> 02:29.975
I'll see you later.

02:34.719 --> 02:36.156
CRISTAL:
Not eating
your biscuits?

02:36.199 --> 02:37.635
Something must really be wrong.

02:37.679 --> 02:39.594
I lost my appetite
after that talk.

02:39.637 --> 02:41.509
I overheard
the end of it.

02:41.552 --> 02:43.902
Sounds like you and Daniel
both got a lot out of this.

02:43.946 --> 02:45.556
I'm not ready for him to leave.

02:45.600 --> 02:48.211
Then maybe
you should tell him that.

02:48.255 --> 02:50.213
No. No, absolutely not.

02:50.257 --> 02:51.954
I want him to decide
on his own to stay.

02:51.997 --> 02:53.216
I just...[sighs]

02:54.261 --> 02:56.654
I have to give him a little
nudge to help him realize that.

02:57.699 --> 02:58.917
ADAM:
Mother, I really need to talk

02:58.961 --> 03:00.484
to you about...One moment, darling.

03:00.528 --> 03:02.138
I am just sending
one more

03:02.182 --> 03:04.706
glowing article
about Alexam to Fallon.

03:04.749 --> 03:05.968
Even has your name in it.

03:06.011 --> 03:07.274
Really? Show me.

03:07.317 --> 03:09.841
Oh. Oops, that's
just my name again.

03:09.885 --> 03:12.104
But she is being
so supportive.

03:12.148 --> 03:14.324
See? She even sent me
a thumbs-up.

03:14.368 --> 03:17.545
[snorts]
That's not a thumb.[phone ringing, buzzing]

03:17.588 --> 03:18.763
Uh...

03:19.764 --> 03:22.245
So, now that we're a success,

03:22.289 --> 03:25.030
we need to think about
expanding our line.

03:25.074 --> 03:26.728
You know, focusing on
the next generation

03:26.771 --> 03:28.164
of anti-aging
treatments.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.644
This generation just started.

03:30.688 --> 03:34.257
So, remember the cosmetic
party that you crashed?

03:34.301 --> 03:36.303
I was testing out
injectable serums

03:36.346 --> 03:38.435
derived from rare
herbal extracts

03:38.479 --> 03:41.221
from overseas that erase
years off of people's faces.

03:41.264 --> 03:43.832
Sounds intriguing.
So it's ready to go?

03:43.875 --> 03:45.660
Not quite yet. It
needs more seed money

03:45.703 --> 03:47.792
before we can produce
on a large scale.

03:47.836 --> 03:50.752
But as soon as we do,
it-it'll redefine the industry.

03:50.795 --> 03:53.537
Pass. We don't have
the cash or the success

03:53.581 --> 03:55.278
to start a new line
from scratch yet.

03:55.322 --> 03:57.759
Yeah, well, I-I think
that would be a mistake.

03:57.802 --> 03:59.587
This will be a game
changer for Alexam.

03:59.630 --> 04:01.893
For Alexam? Or you?

04:01.937 --> 04:03.721
I can't help but think

04:03.765 --> 04:05.897
that this has something to do
with your ego being bruised

04:05.941 --> 04:08.030
because I'm the face
of the company.

04:08.073 --> 04:09.684
Well, that's insulting

04:09.727 --> 04:11.251
and shortsighted

04:11.294 --> 04:12.991
and, mm, yeah, insulting.

04:13.035 --> 04:16.256
Fine. If you can fund it
and develop it yourself

04:16.299 --> 04:17.735
and it works,

04:17.779 --> 04:19.868
we'll bring in a new line
under your name.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.392
FALLON:
Ellen,

04:22.436 --> 04:24.394
I see the board
decided to send you.

04:24.438 --> 04:25.743
Again.

04:25.787 --> 04:27.528
How did the meeting go?Very well.

04:27.571 --> 04:29.312
We discussed your plan,

04:29.356 --> 04:31.706
and everyone loves
the modernization ideas.

04:31.749 --> 04:33.708
Wow. I have to say,

04:33.751 --> 04:36.406
it is so nice having you
here with some good news

04:36.450 --> 04:37.407
for a change.

04:37.451 --> 04:38.539
I can't wait to get started.

04:38.582 --> 04:40.323
Well, you're gonna have to.

04:40.367 --> 04:41.716
Wait, that is.

04:41.759 --> 04:43.370
You see, as much
as we love the ideas,

04:43.413 --> 04:45.546
we don't have the budget
to make drastic changes.

04:45.589 --> 04:47.417
There's the Ellen I know.

04:47.461 --> 04:50.812
The only thing drastic
about my plan

04:50.855 --> 04:52.379
is how great it is.

04:52.422 --> 04:54.859
If we don't move to a
more sustainable model,

04:54.903 --> 04:56.687
we will not attract
the next generation

04:56.731 --> 04:58.428
of employees and consumers.

04:58.472 --> 05:00.474
Not to mention,
what does it look like

05:00.517 --> 05:02.563
if the owner of
Morell Green Energy

05:02.606 --> 05:04.304
hasn't fully committed
to green energy?

05:04.347 --> 05:06.088
We all want to save
the planet, Fallon.

05:06.131 --> 05:07.350
But our job as board members

05:07.394 --> 05:09.483
is to protect
the company's bottom line.

05:09.526 --> 05:12.660
Sales at FSN are so flat,
they're almost invisible.

05:12.703 --> 05:14.401
Okay, well, you know,

05:14.444 --> 05:16.359
the Dom-Mystique clothing
line is a solid moneymaker.

05:16.403 --> 05:18.753
I mean, her Dominoes tune
in every Thursday night.

05:19.754 --> 05:22.800
It's, uh, what Dominique's
fans call themselves.

05:22.844 --> 05:25.977
Yes. The same number of fans
that show up every week.

05:26.021 --> 05:28.371
You need new eyeballs.
And new sales.

05:28.415 --> 05:30.504
Well, that's easier
said than done.

05:30.547 --> 05:32.288
Well, just boost sales
with an exciting product

05:32.332 --> 05:33.724
with a big profit margin,

05:33.768 --> 05:35.509
like jewelry
or beauty products.

05:35.552 --> 05:38.207
Then we can revisit
your proposal.

05:40.731 --> 05:43.125
Hey, I got your message
to come down right away.

05:43.168 --> 05:44.561

05:44.605 --> 05:48.043
I know you're busy,
but, um, I just got bit.

Bit? By what?

05:50.175 --> 05:52.613
By the horse racing bug.

05:52.656 --> 05:55.050
Well, obviously your
love for the sport

05:56.660 --> 05:58.401
Or was already in my blood,

to learn from the best.

I don't know about the best,

06:02.536 --> 06:04.451
but I'm happy to share
what I know with you.

06:04.494 --> 06:06.888
Perfect, because
I bought a horse,

06:06.931 --> 06:08.411
and I would love your opinion.

06:08.455 --> 06:10.326
Claro que sí.I can
take a break from packing

06:10.370 --> 06:12.067
and head out to the stables
later with you today.Yeah, yeah.

06:12.110 --> 06:15.070
But why wait for later
when we can do it now?

I would love for you to stay
in Atlanta and train him.

I think we could do
great things together.

06:35.743 --> 06:38.267

06:38.310 --> 06:41.966
I know. And I said I was okay
with it, but I'm not.

06:42.010 --> 06:44.447
We haven't had enough time
together, and that's the truth.

06:44.491 --> 06:47.537
I agree, but...

06:47.581 --> 06:49.670
I can't change my plans.

as soon as I can.

budding success.

you are never happy

for anybody else's success,
especially not a relative.

07:19.787 --> 07:23.138
Number two, sales are good,
but they're not pineapple good.

07:23.181 --> 07:26.010
First off, I resent
your number one.

07:26.054 --> 07:28.535
And as for number two,
I can help you.

07:28.578 --> 07:30.667
I have a plan to help
boost your sales

projections are,

07:34.105 --> 07:35.846
and I know who
my children are,

07:35.890 --> 07:38.066
so get to the point about
you needing something from me.

07:38.109 --> 07:39.676
We need each other.

07:39.720 --> 07:41.504
I want you to sell
Alexam products

07:41.548 --> 07:44.420
on my shopping network;
we need a fresh new company.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.335
And you need a new
sales outlet.

07:46.378 --> 07:47.815
No, thanks.

07:47.858 --> 07:49.294
Well, can you at least
let me finish

Never mind, I guess
I am finished.

phone call that I have to make,

08:36.603 --> 08:38.213

of the essence,

so I hired a local actress.

08:39.736 --> 08:41.477
She's perfect for the part,
and I took money

08:41.521 --> 08:43.392
out of the wardrobe budget
to cover her higher salary.

08:43.435 --> 08:45.829
Okay. Does she have a name?

08:45.873 --> 08:47.918
Yeah, it's Alexandra Harris.

stage name Sasha.

09:00.888 --> 09:02.498
I mean, she wasn't thrilled.

Yeah, with a hatchet.
She cut half of it

09:16.817 --> 09:18.645

we didn't discuss any of this.

09:23.563 --> 09:26.957

her about Sasha,

to push my luck.

16:58.278 --> 17:01.107
Well, I'll know.
Liam, look,

17:01.150 --> 17:04.632
the reality is, film is
more of a director's medium.

17:04.675 --> 17:06.242
Screenwriters really
aren't necessary

17:06.286 --> 17:07.243
once production begins.

17:07.287 --> 17:09.985
Definitely not on set.

17:10.029 --> 17:12.031
But you can watch
the dailies from home.

17:12.074 --> 17:14.120
Good to see you.

17:16.513 --> 17:18.689
Well, thank you for coming in,
Commissioner Defilippo.

17:18.733 --> 17:20.213
It's the least I can do.

17:20.256 --> 17:21.823
The Carringtons do so much
for the community.

17:21.866 --> 17:24.739
As do you, Customs Commissioner.
It must be a busy job

17:24.782 --> 17:27.872
keeping dangerous imports
out of the state.

17:29.613 --> 17:31.398
Maybe it's time you get
to the point, Mr. Carrington.

17:31.441 --> 17:34.314
Dr. Carrington.
And the point is,

17:34.357 --> 17:38.231
I need some information on
a shipment of Bokocho extract

17:38.274 --> 17:40.102
that you seized from
Balian Imports.

17:40.146 --> 17:41.712
Information?

17:41.756 --> 17:43.975
Location of where you store
impounded goods.

17:44.019 --> 17:46.674
Plus, the security detail
should probably be

17:46.717 --> 17:49.546
conveniently somewhere else
at a certain time.

17:49.590 --> 17:52.071
What you're asking me
is illegal.

17:52.114 --> 17:54.769
Now you get it.

17:54.812 --> 17:58.338
So, this is the tracking number
that I have

17:58.381 --> 18:00.122
and all other information.

18:00.166 --> 18:02.951
I can't do this.
I'm sorry.

18:03.952 --> 18:05.606
Hey, this position
that you have

18:05.649 --> 18:06.955
is an elected one, right?

18:06.998 --> 18:08.826
Here, let me get
the door for you.

18:08.870 --> 18:12.395
Because I seem to remember
my family donating

18:12.439 --> 18:14.136
pretty generously to
your last campaign.

18:14.180 --> 18:15.616
It'd be a real shame if
we had to throw our support

18:15.659 --> 18:17.792
behind, I don't know,
your next opponent.

18:17.835 --> 18:19.272
[exhales sharply]

18:20.316 --> 18:22.101
Let me see what I can find out.

18:22.144 --> 18:23.972
Great. Thank you.

18:27.758 --> 18:29.412
Was that, uh...?

18:29.456 --> 18:33.068
Why have you been bothering me
for the last two days?

18:33.112 --> 18:34.939
How do you even have
my number?

18:34.983 --> 18:36.506
Did I miss the part
where we became friends?

18:36.550 --> 18:39.074
Oh, you did not
because we are not.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.163
But I do remember the moment
when you almost killed me

18:41.207 --> 18:42.164
with lead poisoning.

18:42.208 --> 18:45.341
So I'm thinking you owe me one.

18:45.385 --> 18:47.213
Yeah, we'll call it even
if you get me

18:47.256 --> 18:49.824
into Plenexia Pharmaceuticals'
open house party.

18:51.782 --> 18:54.133
That's right, I seem to remember
giving you half of a liver.

18:54.176 --> 18:57.658
No, I-I can't get you
into Plenexia's party.

18:57.701 --> 18:58.920
Um, just buy your own ticket.

18:58.963 --> 19:00.269
It's not Hamilton,okay?

19:00.313 --> 19:01.792
I can't just go online
and outbid someone.

19:01.836 --> 19:03.881
This event is for
medical professionals only.

19:05.056 --> 19:06.971
And as chief of staff,

19:07.015 --> 19:08.973
you're on the guest list,
plus one.

19:09.017 --> 19:11.019
Yeah, I-I don't think
I can help you.

19:11.062 --> 19:12.716
Well, I could,
but I don't want to?

19:12.760 --> 19:16.067
Look, it's, um, it's vital
I get into this party, okay?

19:16.111 --> 19:18.505
I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't important.

19:20.246 --> 19:21.769
It's not as important as
what I have going on.

19:21.812 --> 19:22.987
All right?
Maybe next year.

19:24.554 --> 19:25.990
FALLON:
Okay, the show starts

19:26.034 --> 19:27.949
in 30 minutes.
Tell Dominique I need

19:27.992 --> 19:30.256
to see her here at least
ten minutes before that.

19:30.299 --> 19:32.867
And don't let her bully you.Fallon!

19:34.129 --> 19:35.652
You're not supposed to be here.

19:35.696 --> 19:38.177
Good news. I got a quick,
temporary contract drawn up.

19:38.220 --> 19:39.613
So all you need to do
is sign it,

19:39.656 --> 19:42.355
get rid of these clothes,
and we're good.

19:42.398 --> 19:44.966
Mother, contract or not,

19:45.009 --> 19:47.142
you can't just show up here
and waltz onto set

19:47.186 --> 19:48.709
like you run the place.

19:48.752 --> 19:49.927
You didn't even bring
any product with you.

19:49.971 --> 19:52.408
Boys!

19:56.543 --> 19:59.459
You should probably go tell...DOMINIQUE: Alexis?

19:59.502 --> 20:01.112
[clears throat]

20:01.156 --> 20:03.941
What the hell are
you doing here?

20:03.985 --> 20:06.422
Is she the one you wanted
to give my spot to?

20:06.466 --> 20:08.424
No.
Excuse me?

20:08.468 --> 20:12.385
Yes. Uh, well, no, no.
And yes. It's complicated.

20:12.428 --> 20:13.777
You promised me Thursdays
at 5:00.

20:13.821 --> 20:15.214
We now have a contract,

20:15.257 --> 20:16.824
so you need to tell her
to pack it up.

20:16.867 --> 20:20.219
This is my time slot, Fallon.
I did not build up

20:20.262 --> 20:24.266
my company and my audience
so this relationship-destroying

20:24.310 --> 20:26.877
opportunist can ride
my coattails.

20:26.921 --> 20:29.271
All right, everybody,
let's calm down.

20:29.315 --> 20:31.882
I need to go figure this out,
and I can't do that

20:31.926 --> 20:32.970
with you two arguing.

20:33.014 --> 20:36.017
So... I need a minute.

20:38.324 --> 20:41.936
DANIEL:
Is this what you meant yesterday
by "catching a game"?

20:41.979 --> 20:44.634
Well, I figured we could get
our father-son soccer in

20:44.678 --> 20:46.332
before you leave, and you could
see what it's like

20:46.375 --> 20:48.072
to hang with the pros.Ah.

20:48.116 --> 20:50.205
When I go to games,
I sit in the cheap seats.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.337
Now you're on the pitch.

20:51.380 --> 20:52.686
My friend used to own the team,

20:52.729 --> 20:54.035
so he pulled a few strings.

20:54.078 --> 20:56.298
Try this on.

20:57.386 --> 20:58.909
[chuckles]

20:58.953 --> 21:01.521
I always wanted one like this
when I was a kid.

21:01.564 --> 21:04.306
And now you're an honorary
member of Atlantix FC.

21:04.350 --> 21:06.047
[phone ringing, buzzing]

21:06.090 --> 21:08.571
[scoffs]

21:08.615 --> 21:11.313
Hey, shouldn't you get that?
Was it the hotel?

21:11.357 --> 21:12.619
It was just our accountant.

21:12.662 --> 21:14.708
Do they need you there?
Because we can go.

21:14.751 --> 21:15.709
No, no, no, no, no.

21:15.752 --> 21:16.710
The guy's just a stickler

21:16.753 --> 21:18.146
for paying taxes on time.

21:18.189 --> 21:20.714
What's the worst
that could happen, right?

21:20.757 --> 21:22.498
I'm kidding.
I always pay on time.

21:22.542 --> 21:23.804
Now, can we get
this game started?

21:23.847 --> 21:25.762
Just have fun, okay?

21:25.806 --> 21:27.938
Take advantage of having
a super successful

21:27.982 --> 21:28.939
hotel-owning son.

21:28.983 --> 21:29.984
You ready?

21:30.027 --> 21:31.333
Dale.

21:31.377 --> 21:32.726
HOST:
Now, tell us

21:32.769 --> 21:35.381
a little bit
about this stunning creation.

21:35.424 --> 21:39.776
This gorgeous design, also
available in aqua and ivory,

21:39.820 --> 21:43.606
was designed for all of you
hard-working Dominoes.Mm-hmm.

21:43.650 --> 21:46.435
You can go from day to
night by just switching

21:46.479 --> 21:48.785
from a flat to a heel.

21:48.829 --> 21:50.744
Mm-hmm. And it's
an incredible steal

21:50.787 --> 21:52.093
at a price point of...[Alexis clears throat]

21:53.268 --> 21:54.704
[nervous chuckle]

21:54.748 --> 21:58.621
And a big FSN welcome
to Alexis Colby,

21:58.665 --> 22:00.841
mother of the founder
of this network.

22:00.884 --> 22:03.800
Wonder how she got this spot.

22:03.844 --> 22:05.411
Sorry.

22:05.454 --> 22:08.762
So, Alexis, tell the viewers
about your product.

22:08.805 --> 22:10.372
You mean my groundbreaking,

22:10.416 --> 22:13.027
anti-aging miracle cream
by Alexam?

22:13.070 --> 22:15.116
Well, let's just say,
as old as these clothes

22:15.159 --> 22:18.772
will make you look,
this cream will do the opposite.

22:18.815 --> 22:20.295
FALLON:
Oh, look, it's Ellen.

22:20.339 --> 22:22.036
I came down from corporate
when I saw this.

22:22.079 --> 22:23.733
What exactly is going on?

22:23.777 --> 22:25.518
Oh, it's a new strategy.

22:25.561 --> 22:27.389
You see, as a personal
favor to me,

22:27.433 --> 22:31.088
Dom has allowed Alexis
to come on for five minutes

22:31.132 --> 22:32.612
during her show.

22:32.655 --> 22:34.265
With the publicity that
Alexam already has,

22:34.309 --> 22:35.963
they have a built-in audience,
so it's just about getting

22:36.006 --> 22:38.095
that audience to see
Dom's clothes

22:38.139 --> 22:40.097
and Dom's audience to see
the new beauty product.

22:40.141 --> 22:41.098
Here, sit. Let's watch.

22:41.142 --> 22:43.057
I wasn't finished yet.

22:43.100 --> 22:44.493
[chuckling nervously]

22:44.537 --> 22:47.975
Nobody is interested in
last decade's knockoffs.

22:48.018 --> 22:50.412
What people really want
is radiant skin.

22:50.456 --> 22:52.849
Always in fashion.

22:52.893 --> 22:54.590
All right, well,
I'm gonna leave

22:54.634 --> 22:55.852
before my arms get ripped off.

22:55.896 --> 22:58.072
Ladies, this was fun.

22:58.115 --> 23:00.857
Ugh! Is your cream supposed
to smell like this?

23:00.901 --> 23:02.990
What's the scent, rotting milk?

23:03.033 --> 23:04.513
[sarcastic laugh]

23:04.557 --> 23:06.428
I think that's your own
failure you're smelling.

23:06.472 --> 23:09.344
Or perhaps the musty odor
of the grandma

23:09.388 --> 23:10.911
you stole these clothes from.

23:10.954 --> 23:13.392
Well, at least I didn't put
two dollars' worth

23:13.435 --> 23:16.960
of lotion in a jar and call it
a miracle. [chuckles]

23:17.004 --> 23:20.703
Look at this shoddy stitching.

23:20.747 --> 23:23.837
Ugh! What, did drunken elves
put this together?

23:23.880 --> 23:25.839
Get your filthy hands
off my clothes.

23:25.882 --> 23:28.363
Get your stinky nose
out of my business.

23:28.407 --> 23:29.582
DOMINIQUE:
Gladly.

23:31.453 --> 23:32.541
[laughs]

23:32.585 --> 23:33.542
ALEXIS:
Take that!

23:33.586 --> 23:34.891
Stinky,

23:34.935 --> 23:37.416
moldy, moldy, blah!

23:37.459 --> 23:38.939
Stinky!

23:38.982 --> 23:42.812
So, Ellen, when do you think
I can expect that money

23:42.856 --> 23:44.335
for my modernization plan?

23:44.379 --> 23:45.946
[both shouting]

23:56.086 --> 23:57.566
MICHAEL:
Liam?

23:57.610 --> 23:59.612
Oh, hey.

23:59.655 --> 24:02.092
Care to join the old, uh,
failed Hollywood screenwriter

24:02.136 --> 24:03.877
for a snack?
Oh, stop it.

24:03.920 --> 24:06.227
You're not a failure.
There is no movie without you.

24:06.270 --> 24:10.492
It's true. But thanks to Nina,
there is no set with me.

24:10.536 --> 24:12.451
Oh, yeah, I heard she
kind of banished you.

24:12.494 --> 24:14.017
I got to be honest, man,
this isn't exactly

24:14.061 --> 24:15.715
the experience I was expecting.

24:15.758 --> 24:17.630
I get it.
Unless you're the director,

24:17.673 --> 24:19.632
there's always someone who
outranks you in this business.

24:19.675 --> 24:21.938
Yeah, well, it seems like
everyone outranks me.

24:21.982 --> 24:24.288
Nina just gets
to play dictator?

24:24.332 --> 24:25.681
Pretty much.
There's a reason

24:25.725 --> 24:27.466
it sounds similar
to "director."

24:27.509 --> 24:31.252
That is also why her name is
at the top of the call sheet.

24:31.295 --> 24:34.647
Although technically Janelle
is number one on the call sheet.

24:34.690 --> 24:36.866
You know, star power,
don't make eye contact.

24:36.910 --> 24:38.607
All that.
Perfect.

24:38.651 --> 24:41.392
Another person who can overrule
me without even looking at me.

24:41.436 --> 24:43.133
[both laugh]

24:43.177 --> 24:45.005
[groans]
Is it too early
to start drinking?

24:45.048 --> 24:47.660
Absolutely not, especially
when it's on the house.

24:47.703 --> 24:49.618
Jesse, a beer for
my friend, please.

24:49.662 --> 24:51.490
Coming right up.

24:51.533 --> 24:53.535
Come to the set tomorrow.
I'll work things out with Nina.

24:53.579 --> 24:55.058
Okay?
Thanks, bud.

24:55.102 --> 24:56.190
Yep.

24:57.408 --> 24:58.714
Thank you.

25:01.151 --> 25:03.893
So Dom gets to storm off,
but I have to stay?

25:03.937 --> 25:06.026
I need to go do damage
control with Alexam

25:06.069 --> 25:08.332
before Adam finds out
and has an aneurysm.

25:08.376 --> 25:11.553
Youhave to do damage control?

25:11.597 --> 25:13.207
I'm the one who owns
this network.

25:13.250 --> 25:15.165
The one that you and Dom
just turned into

25:15.209 --> 25:16.602
the Divas of WrestleMania

25:16.645 --> 25:18.952
while the board had
a front-row seat.

25:18.995 --> 25:20.344
I can't believe I put
my faith in you.

25:20.388 --> 25:23.347
Oh, hold on.
You lied to me.
[scoffs]

25:23.391 --> 25:25.349
You were never gonna
put me in this time slot.

25:25.393 --> 25:27.221
I should have turned you down
and stayed focused

25:27.264 --> 25:28.570
on my partnership with Adam.

25:28.614 --> 25:31.355
Oh, I do not want to hear
another word about

25:31.399 --> 25:34.010
your partnership with
my creepy brother.

25:34.054 --> 25:36.752
Why are you the only one who
can't see him for who he is?

25:36.796 --> 25:38.319
I never said he was perfect.

25:38.362 --> 25:41.670
Why does his success matter
more than mine?

25:41.714 --> 25:43.629
His success is my success,

25:43.672 --> 25:45.152
but I try to
treat you both fairly.

25:45.195 --> 25:48.416
You know what?
Forget it.

25:48.459 --> 25:52.463
This is a great reminder
to never ask you for favors.

25:52.507 --> 25:55.684
Oh...Unless, of course,
I frame you for murder, right?

25:55.728 --> 25:58.339
Then you'll do
anything I want.

25:58.382 --> 26:00.428
Fallon, I...

26:03.866 --> 26:06.216
[groans]
Are you okay?

26:06.260 --> 26:08.218
I'm fine.

26:08.262 --> 26:10.917
I'm just not... in playing shape
at the moment.

26:10.960 --> 26:12.614
Well, I hope we didn't
overdo it.

26:12.658 --> 26:15.574
The chemo's taken
a lot out of me.

26:15.617 --> 26:18.011
But I'm already feeling
a lot better.

26:21.057 --> 26:23.799
I had a great time today.

26:23.843 --> 26:25.801
Thank you for arranging it.

26:25.845 --> 26:27.542
We can do this all the time.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.892
[chuckling] I don't think
my knees could take it.

26:29.936 --> 26:32.286
Well, I don't mean this
specifically.

26:32.329 --> 26:35.594
I mean anything you like...
if you stay.

26:35.637 --> 26:39.032
You know, I booked Oscar D'León
for a residency at the club.

26:39.075 --> 26:42.862
Sam, as much as I love
the Lion of Salsa...

26:42.905 --> 26:44.820
No, I know.
I know you miss home,

26:44.864 --> 26:47.170
but you can visit there
and stay here.

26:47.214 --> 26:48.737
I mean, there's still so much
more I want to do with you.

26:48.781 --> 26:50.260
I have a list.
Do you want to see it?

26:50.304 --> 26:52.567
Sam, Sam, please stop.

26:54.700 --> 26:56.876
I need to tell you something,
and it's not easy.

26:58.704 --> 27:03.230
I didn't stop my treatments
because I'm cancer-free.

27:03.273 --> 27:05.580
I stopped them because
I still have it.

27:05.624 --> 27:08.452
And the doctors say
that it's spread,

27:08.496 --> 27:10.759
and there's nothing else
they can do for me.

27:10.803 --> 27:12.543
No.

27:12.587 --> 27:13.849
Why didn't you tell me?

27:13.893 --> 27:16.635
We never should have
come here and played.

27:16.678 --> 27:19.289
I think the cancer will
get me before the fútbol.

27:24.425 --> 27:27.123
I'm dying, Samuel.

27:27.167 --> 27:29.909
And I won't be a burden
on you in my last days.

27:32.215 --> 27:33.956
I'm going back to Venezuela.

27:50.059 --> 27:52.279
That should be right.

27:56.239 --> 27:58.024
Hey. You can go now.

27:58.067 --> 27:59.373
Excuse me?

27:59.416 --> 28:01.288
Didn't the commissioner
call you?

28:01.331 --> 28:02.289
You have the night off.

28:02.332 --> 28:04.117
Look, I don't know who you are

28:04.160 --> 28:05.945
or what you're talking about,
but my shift just started.

28:05.988 --> 28:07.163
I don't get off
until midnight.

28:07.207 --> 28:09.557
Oh, okay. I see
what's going on.

28:09.600 --> 28:12.038
Hey...
No, no, no, no, no.

28:13.474 --> 28:16.564
All I need you to do
is to, you know,

28:16.607 --> 28:20.655
take a break somewhere else
while I unload some crates

28:20.699 --> 28:22.091
from one of these trucks.

28:22.135 --> 28:23.005
And then I'll be gone.
How's that sound?

28:23.049 --> 28:25.051
Sir, you can't pay me off.

28:28.445 --> 28:31.840
But you can donate
to my vacation fund.

28:31.884 --> 28:33.059
All right, uh, can
we open this one?

28:33.102 --> 28:34.669
Sure.

28:35.975 --> 28:38.238
This came in yesterday.

28:38.281 --> 28:41.110
Whatever it is,
it's perishable,

28:41.154 --> 28:42.851
so we kept it temperature
controlled.

28:47.856 --> 28:49.162
Did it perish?

28:49.205 --> 28:52.774
Uh, honestly, I'm not sure.

28:54.123 --> 28:56.909
Here we go. Yep, it's gone.

28:56.952 --> 28:58.562
Thanks. That's really helpful.

28:58.606 --> 29:00.042
Whatever it was,
it was surrendered to

29:00.086 --> 29:01.609
a private entity
earlier this evening.

29:01.652 --> 29:04.264
A private entity? Who?Doesn't say.

29:12.228 --> 29:14.665
Moldy, moldy, blah![Blake laughing]

29:14.709 --> 29:16.015
Oh, dear.

29:16.058 --> 29:18.234
I, I'm assuming that you
saw this clown show.

29:18.278 --> 29:20.236
Yep. Had a ringside seat.

29:20.280 --> 29:22.282
I don't know what
to do with them.

29:22.325 --> 29:25.198
They are two grown women
acting like spoiled brats.

29:25.241 --> 29:26.895
I mean, how am I supposed
to be a good mother

29:26.939 --> 29:28.505
if I can't even get
those two to behave?

29:28.549 --> 29:30.464
Look, I may not have been
the best parent...

29:30.507 --> 29:32.205
No argument here.

29:32.248 --> 29:33.946
...but I did what I thought
was best for you

29:33.989 --> 29:35.295
when you were younger,
and the fact that

29:35.338 --> 29:36.687
you're so successful
is a testament

29:36.731 --> 29:38.124
to how well I raised you.

29:38.167 --> 29:41.214
Only you could start
by complimenting me

29:41.257 --> 29:43.042
and finish by
congratulating yourself.

29:43.085 --> 29:45.305
I hate to burst your
Father of the Year bubble,

29:45.348 --> 29:48.221
but I had a lot to do
with my own success.

29:48.264 --> 29:50.266
And where do you think you got
the confidence to think that?

29:50.310 --> 29:52.094
Okay, we could do this
all day. What's your point?

29:52.138 --> 29:54.531
Alexis and Dominique
need tough love.

29:54.575 --> 29:56.011
Yeah, stop babying them.

29:56.055 --> 29:57.665
Come on, you're in charge.

29:57.708 --> 29:59.449
Do you remember when you
didn't want to go to school

29:59.493 --> 30:01.930
because the tabloids ran that
ridiculous story about me

30:01.974 --> 30:03.932
trying to drown your mother
when we were getting divorced?

30:03.976 --> 30:05.151
You did try to drown her.

30:05.194 --> 30:06.805
I'm talking about parenting,

30:06.848 --> 30:08.284
not journalism. All right?

30:08.328 --> 30:10.112
The point is,
I still made you go.

30:10.156 --> 30:12.158
Yeah, and I was tortured
for weeks.

30:12.201 --> 30:13.899
But you survived.
And you want to know why?

30:13.942 --> 30:15.726
'Cause of tough love.
You're welcome.

30:15.770 --> 30:18.338
You want some practice
being a good mother?

30:18.381 --> 30:20.862
Find a way to get those two
bozos to work together

30:20.906 --> 30:22.298
before they ruin your network.

30:22.342 --> 30:25.258
NINA:
This is all your fault.

30:25.301 --> 30:26.737
If you hadn't hired
your girlfriend,

30:26.781 --> 30:28.348
we wouldn't have had to
cut the wardrobe budget

30:28.391 --> 30:30.872
to afford her, and our star
wouldn't be refusing

30:30.916 --> 30:32.004
to come out of her trailer.

30:32.047 --> 30:33.614
We needed to hire
someone quickly,

30:33.657 --> 30:35.529
or we would have
shut down production.

30:35.572 --> 30:37.226
I saved us from falling behind.

30:37.270 --> 30:38.662
And Sasha is good.

30:38.706 --> 30:40.316
It's not my fault
Janelle is a diva.

30:40.360 --> 30:42.101
Well, you're not helping,
and for a producer,

30:42.144 --> 30:44.190
all you seem to produce
are new problems for me.

30:44.233 --> 30:45.800
Oh, well, since you're
the director,

30:45.844 --> 30:48.542
maybe you can direct her
out here.

30:48.585 --> 30:50.326
Hey.

30:50.370 --> 30:51.719
Janelle said she'll be
out in a few minutes.

30:51.762 --> 30:53.460
When did you even get here?

30:53.503 --> 30:54.504
Oh, I've been in
Janelle's trailer

30:54.548 --> 30:56.028
listening to her concerns.

30:56.071 --> 30:57.638
Look, she was unhappy about
the wardrobe budget,

30:57.681 --> 30:58.987
but she was also upset

30:59.031 --> 30:59.988
that her favorite scene got cut.

31:00.032 --> 31:02.382
Let me guess, scene 17.

31:02.425 --> 31:04.036
That's the one.

31:04.079 --> 31:05.646
Look, but don't worry,
she loved my rewrite,

31:05.689 --> 31:07.126
which solves one
of her problems.

31:07.169 --> 31:09.128
Now it's up to you two
to solve the other.

31:09.171 --> 31:11.260
I'm just the lowly writer.

31:11.304 --> 31:14.568
Okay, I'm not thrilled about
how this whole thing went down,

31:14.611 --> 31:17.092
but I'm also not gonna
alienate Janelle on day two.

31:18.615 --> 31:19.747
Welcome back to set,

31:19.790 --> 31:22.184
and don't go behind
my back again.

31:24.056 --> 31:28.234
That was pretty badass,
going straight to the star.

31:28.277 --> 31:30.149
Well, you gave me the idea.

31:30.192 --> 31:31.846
I studied that call sheet
and I realized,

31:31.890 --> 31:33.674
I mean, there's always
someone more important.

31:33.717 --> 31:35.154
Mm-hmm.
Good thing it worked.

31:35.197 --> 31:36.938
I know, right?[both laugh]

31:36.982 --> 31:38.766
Hey, now that I'm allowed
on set,

31:38.809 --> 31:40.768
you think you can get me
a chair with my name on it?

31:40.811 --> 31:41.856
I got you, man.
[laughs]

31:41.900 --> 31:43.684
SAM:
I can't believe

31:43.727 --> 31:45.904
I got my real father back
just to lose him again.

31:45.947 --> 31:48.776
But you got to spend
these past few weeks with him.

31:48.819 --> 31:50.386
Would you rather have
never known him?

31:51.387 --> 31:53.041
No, you're right.

31:53.085 --> 31:54.695
I mean, I'll-I'll never forget
our time together.

31:54.738 --> 31:56.653
It's just...

31:56.697 --> 31:59.352
I don't want him to go
through this alone.

31:59.395 --> 32:01.832
Is there anything
that we can do?Just name it.

32:01.876 --> 32:04.923
Actually, there is.

32:04.966 --> 32:07.577
Can I please borrow your jet
to fly Daniel back to Venezuela?

32:07.621 --> 32:10.319
Yeah, I'll do you one better.
I'll go down with you

32:10.363 --> 32:11.712
so you don't have
to fly back alone.

32:13.757 --> 32:15.846
Thank you, Blake.
It means a lot.

32:18.632 --> 32:20.982
Dr. Carrington.

32:21.026 --> 32:25.073
You must be so excited about
Alexam's successful launch.

32:25.117 --> 32:28.076
Yeah, I-I am. Thank you, uh...

32:28.120 --> 32:30.035
Gabrielle.
Mm-hmm.

32:30.078 --> 32:32.298
Uh, it's really nice to know
that someone recognizes

32:32.341 --> 32:33.734
that I'm part of the company.

32:33.777 --> 32:35.736
Oh, you're part of the company?

32:35.779 --> 32:39.783
Oh, I just meant because
Alexis is your mother.

32:39.827 --> 32:41.524
Are you sure you're
a part of the company?

32:41.568 --> 32:43.657
Yeah. Yeah, Nurse, I am.

32:43.700 --> 32:46.529
Alexam is literally my name
and my mother's name

32:46.573 --> 32:48.140
put together.

32:48.183 --> 32:50.359
And, oh, I came up with
the anti-aging formula.

32:50.403 --> 32:53.275
Well, that's great.

32:53.319 --> 32:56.452
But your mother,
she was just a hoot

32:56.496 --> 32:57.497
on FSN last night.

32:57.540 --> 32:58.889
Yeah, Alexis loves to put on

32:58.933 --> 33:00.195
a good show for the public.

33:00.239 --> 33:01.980
Not so much
in her personal life.

33:02.023 --> 33:03.982
Oh, got a meeting.

33:04.025 --> 33:05.896
Before you go,
is there any way

33:05.940 --> 33:08.421
that I can get some free samples
of the miracle cream?

33:08.464 --> 33:10.466
No.

33:10.510 --> 33:12.686
[phone ringing, buzzing]

33:15.080 --> 33:17.038
What'd you find out?

33:19.214 --> 33:21.564
You've got to be kidding.

33:21.608 --> 33:23.871
Yeah, okay. Thank you.

33:23.914 --> 33:25.438
That son of a bitch.

33:30.443 --> 33:33.141
I, uh, need to see a man
about a horse.

33:33.185 --> 33:35.752
Or actually just call him
and make sure it got returned.

33:39.756 --> 33:41.062
I heard about the horse.

33:41.106 --> 33:44.283
It was something
you don't see every day.

33:44.326 --> 33:47.242
A beautiful horse in front
of a beautiful hotel.

33:47.286 --> 33:49.375
You know, Sam has worked
really hard

33:49.418 --> 33:50.811
to make La Mirage
something special.

33:50.854 --> 33:52.073
You must be very proud of him.

33:52.117 --> 33:54.075
I am.

33:54.119 --> 33:56.077
My son's achieved
the American dream.

33:56.121 --> 33:57.948
Yeah, he's pretty amazing.

33:59.472 --> 34:00.734
Look, I know the two of us

34:00.777 --> 34:02.301
didn't get off
to the best start,

34:02.344 --> 34:05.043
but I'm happy that you guys
have gotten close.

34:05.086 --> 34:06.870
Sam wouldn't do this
for just anyone.

34:06.914 --> 34:09.699
I appreciate you letting us
borrow the plane.

34:09.743 --> 34:11.919
He insisted I couldn't
fly commercial.

34:11.962 --> 34:13.790
I'm not talking about the plane,
I'm talking about him

34:13.834 --> 34:15.096
staying with you in Caracas.

34:15.140 --> 34:16.880
I know your son.

34:16.924 --> 34:18.926
He's gonna stay in Venezuela
as long as he needs to.

34:18.969 --> 34:20.667
That's not what I want.

34:20.710 --> 34:22.103
He's got a life here
in Atlanta.

34:22.147 --> 34:23.757
He's got his hotel to run.

34:23.800 --> 34:25.106
He can't give it all up.

34:25.150 --> 34:26.325
Sam's stubborn.

34:28.109 --> 34:30.111
Well, there's something else.

34:30.155 --> 34:32.157
I don't want him to go through
what comes next.

34:32.200 --> 34:36.117
Yeah, I understand that.

34:36.161 --> 34:38.989
But one thing that I can
definitely say about Sam

34:39.033 --> 34:40.469
is that he's loyal.

34:40.513 --> 34:43.472
And he's not gonna let you
face that future alone.

34:43.516 --> 34:44.995
Not after all he's missed.

34:45.039 --> 34:47.520
He's gonna stick by your side.

34:47.563 --> 34:48.999
Doesn't matter what country
you're in.

34:51.263 --> 34:53.047
Well, maybe it was
a mistake to leave.

34:53.091 --> 34:57.486
Eh, if Sam's gonna take care
of me, we might as well...

34:57.530 --> 35:00.750
Wait, is, is that Atlanta?

35:00.794 --> 35:02.883
Yeah.

35:02.926 --> 35:04.624
Thought you might have
a change of heart,

35:04.667 --> 35:06.626
so I told the pilot
to circle the area

35:06.669 --> 35:08.018
until you made up your mind.

35:08.062 --> 35:11.021
I'll tell him we can land now.

35:11.065 --> 35:12.153
Hey, what's going on?

35:12.197 --> 35:13.633
Are we turning back to Atlanta?

35:13.676 --> 35:16.157
Apparently we never left.

35:16.201 --> 35:17.506
What...

35:17.550 --> 35:19.465
Did you really book
Oscar D'León?

35:21.336 --> 35:24.252
I think I might want
to stick around for that.

35:24.296 --> 35:25.993
If that's okay with you.

35:26.036 --> 35:28.082
[exhales]

35:30.693 --> 35:32.042
DOMINIQUE:
Fallon,

35:32.086 --> 35:33.783
I got your message.
Is Hoda here yet?

35:33.827 --> 35:37.265
Not yet. But take a seat
and I'll fill you in.

35:37.309 --> 35:39.006
ALEXIS:
I'm here!

35:39.049 --> 35:41.574
I'm here. Has Dolly arrived yet?
[gasps]

35:41.617 --> 35:42.836
How dare you

35:42.879 --> 35:44.011
show your face after you tried

35:44.054 --> 35:45.926
to sabotage me?

35:45.969 --> 35:49.190
Look who's back, trying to jump
on the Dom-Mystique bandwagon.

35:49.234 --> 35:50.539
You may have got to Brady,

35:50.583 --> 35:51.932
but you are...Enough!

35:51.975 --> 35:53.281
I need less fighting

35:53.325 --> 35:54.891
and more help
from the both of you.

35:54.935 --> 35:56.589
Now sit.

35:56.632 --> 35:58.286
[clears throat]

35:58.330 --> 36:01.289
The three of us need
to have a little talk.

36:01.333 --> 36:04.205
And by that, I mean I need
to talk to the two of you,

36:04.249 --> 36:05.424
and you need to sit down

36:05.467 --> 36:06.903
and listen.

36:06.947 --> 36:08.209
Yes.

36:08.253 --> 36:10.516
Does this mean
Dolly is not coming?

36:10.559 --> 36:11.734
She is not.

36:11.778 --> 36:14.084
And neither is
Hoda. I lied.

36:14.128 --> 36:16.043
I needed a reason to get the two
of you in a room together.

36:16.086 --> 36:17.523
The truth is,

36:17.566 --> 36:19.177
we can all help each other.

36:19.220 --> 36:21.004
We just need to learn
a little lesson

36:21.048 --> 36:23.224
about getting along with others.

36:23.268 --> 36:25.183
We're not in
preschool, Fallon.

36:25.226 --> 36:27.141
Yes, I know.
Not even preschoolers

36:27.185 --> 36:29.143
would have behaved
the way you two did last night.

36:30.710 --> 36:32.059
But for some reason,

36:32.102 --> 36:33.278
viewers loved it.

36:33.321 --> 36:34.801
We kept replaying the video,

36:34.844 --> 36:36.933
and the sales numbers
just went up and up.

36:36.977 --> 36:38.457
I can't explain
it. It must be

36:38.500 --> 36:40.067
the same reason
people enjoy watching

36:40.110 --> 36:42.722
videos of car accidents
or natural disasters

36:42.765 --> 36:45.072
or Wheel of Fortune.

36:45.115 --> 36:46.943
The viewers
love you guys together.

36:46.987 --> 36:49.729
I think we know
who deserves the credit.I think we do.

36:49.772 --> 36:51.296
FALLON:
So, here's how this is gonna go.

36:51.339 --> 36:53.211
You will each have your
own respective shows,

36:53.254 --> 36:55.604
but you will
also present together

36:55.648 --> 36:58.477
on Saturdays twice a month.

36:58.520 --> 37:01.262
And why shouldn't I take
my business elsewhere?

37:01.306 --> 37:03.873
Because you're smart.
Your Dom-Mystique line

37:03.917 --> 37:05.614
sold out in record time,

37:05.658 --> 37:07.747
and you doubled
your fan base.

37:07.790 --> 37:09.749
This will raise your profile

37:09.792 --> 37:13.274
as a top-notch designer
even more if you can learn

37:13.318 --> 37:14.841
to move on.

37:16.321 --> 37:19.715
Fine. I'll present with her.
But only twice a month.

37:19.759 --> 37:22.762
She literally just said that.Mm.

37:22.805 --> 37:26.200
Lower your cut by five percent,
and I guess we have a deal.

37:27.201 --> 37:29.159
[breathes deeply]

37:30.160 --> 37:32.250
Okay. You can go now.

37:32.293 --> 37:35.165
I have been thinking
about what you said before.

37:36.079 --> 37:37.037
About Adam?

37:37.080 --> 37:38.734
I don't care.

37:38.778 --> 37:41.694
You can give him whatever
favorable treatment you want.

37:41.737 --> 37:44.523
I don't want to hear any more
about your twisted relationship.

37:44.566 --> 37:46.089
You were right.

37:49.092 --> 37:52.226
I should have known how you felt
before you even had to say it.

37:52.270 --> 37:53.923
I have been favoring Adam.

37:53.967 --> 37:56.143
But in a way, it's your fault.

37:56.186 --> 37:57.797
Of course it is.

37:57.840 --> 38:00.974
It's your fault
because you're so successful.

38:02.932 --> 38:05.152
You never seem
like you need any help.

38:05.195 --> 38:06.675
Adam always does.

38:06.719 --> 38:09.287
You're not wrong about that.I let you

38:09.330 --> 38:12.333
do your thing.
Stay out of your way when I can.

38:12.377 --> 38:14.422
Well, I appreciate that.

38:14.466 --> 38:16.772
And if I'm being honest,

38:16.816 --> 38:20.515
I have noticed a tiny bit
of personal growth in you

38:20.559 --> 38:22.125
lately.Mm.

38:22.169 --> 38:24.476
And, uh,
I think I could use your help.

38:24.519 --> 38:26.913
I agreed to the new format.

38:26.956 --> 38:29.263
No. No, no, no, no, no.
It's not... not the show.

38:29.307 --> 38:30.830
It's just, you know...

38:32.179 --> 38:34.094
When I have a baby...

38:35.530 --> 38:38.838
...maybe you could be
a little useful.

38:38.881 --> 38:40.274
[squeals]

38:40.318 --> 38:41.754
All right. Okay.

38:41.797 --> 38:43.625
Watch the eggs. Watch the eggs.

38:43.669 --> 38:45.235
[chuckles softly]

38:45.279 --> 38:47.455
SAM:
I'm so happy
you changed your mind.

38:48.500 --> 38:51.416
You need to be surrounded
by people who love you.

38:51.459 --> 38:53.766
I'm grateful
you never gave up on me,

38:53.809 --> 38:55.463
Sam.

38:55.507 --> 38:58.031
I'm gonna let the nurse
help you settle in.

38:58.074 --> 39:00.512
I need to make a quick call.
Okay?

39:10.391 --> 39:12.393
[speaking Spanish]

39:46.601 --> 39:49.125
FALLON:
Oh, my God.
You're still working?

39:49.169 --> 39:50.779
There are so many rewrites.

39:50.823 --> 39:52.694
Nina loved my other
changes, though.

39:52.738 --> 39:54.740
You should be careful
what you wish for.

39:54.783 --> 39:56.306
Well, I guess

39:56.350 --> 39:58.265
we can take a break
on the baby-making.

39:58.308 --> 39:59.701
I just thought
that we should get to it

39:59.745 --> 40:01.224
since I've had
so much parenting practice

40:01.268 --> 40:02.312
with Alexis and Dom.

40:02.356 --> 40:04.445
Oh, yeah, I saw that on FSN.

40:04.489 --> 40:06.926
Looked like a disaster.Oh, it was.

40:06.969 --> 40:09.189
Until the numbers came in,
and then it wasn't.

40:09.232 --> 40:11.757
Now the board
will let me do whatever I want.

40:11.800 --> 40:14.803
And what I want is you.

40:14.847 --> 40:16.414
[chuckles softly][kisses]

40:16.457 --> 40:19.025
Though I don't really need
board approval for that.

40:19.068 --> 40:21.506
I need to finish
this one scene.

40:23.072 --> 40:25.379
Well, if you skip that scene,

40:25.423 --> 40:27.947
I'll show you my new lingerie
under this robe.

40:27.990 --> 40:30.123
And I promise you

40:30.166 --> 40:32.212
it's worth it.

40:35.084 --> 40:37.347
Oh, man. My laptop just crashed.

40:37.391 --> 40:39.045
[gasps]Guess I'll just

40:39.088 --> 40:40.960
have to finish this
in the morning.

40:44.093 --> 40:45.486
ADAM:
So, you're the one
who bought it?

40:45.530 --> 40:47.140
Mm.

40:47.183 --> 40:50.273
That private investigator
you hired works really fast.

40:50.317 --> 40:51.927
That's what I pay him to do.

40:51.971 --> 40:54.669
So, why do you need
my Bokocho shipment so badly?

40:54.713 --> 40:56.192
Oh, I don't need it at all.

40:56.236 --> 40:58.281
I just got it out of impound
to get your attention.

40:58.325 --> 41:00.196
When I saw my old friend
Commissioner Defilippo

41:00.240 --> 41:03.156
at the, uh, hospital,
I knew something was up,

41:03.199 --> 41:06.420
so I gave her a call.Oh, I am so not donating
to her next campaign.

41:06.464 --> 41:09.031
Well, I am.
Uh, which is why she told me

41:09.075 --> 41:10.555
what you were looking for,
and considering

41:10.598 --> 41:12.078
it's not even allowed
in the U.S.,

41:12.121 --> 41:14.863
uh, she was more than happy
to make it disappear.

41:14.907 --> 41:17.170
But don't worry.
I'll sell it to you

41:17.213 --> 41:18.954
for less than wholesale

41:18.998 --> 41:21.783
in exchange for getting me
in the Plenexia Pharma party.

41:22.784 --> 41:24.090
What do you need at this party

41:24.133 --> 41:25.613
that you're willing
to wreck my life?

41:25.657 --> 41:27.833
You'll find out
as soon as you make this happen.

41:27.876 --> 41:31.489
So, it's illegal, right?

41:31.532 --> 41:33.273
Yeah, it's the most
logical explanation.

41:33.316 --> 41:35.580
Look, I'm chief of staff.

41:35.623 --> 41:37.407
I could go to prison
for aiding and abetting.

41:37.451 --> 41:39.453
Come on, you didn't seem
too concerned about prison

41:39.497 --> 41:41.107
when you were bribing
a customs official.

41:41.150 --> 41:42.804
Yeah, but that was for me.

41:42.848 --> 41:44.806
I'm trying to revolutionize
the skin care industry.

41:44.850 --> 41:46.634
Good for you.

41:46.678 --> 41:49.376
So, for us both
to get what we want,

41:49.419 --> 41:52.510
looks like we both have to make
a deal with the devil.

41:54.512 --> 41:56.731
Are you in or out?

42:01.301 --> 42:02.868
I'm in.
