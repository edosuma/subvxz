10:09.142 --> 10:10.010
- GIMME THOSE!

10:14.915 --> 10:17.250
- WE HAVE TO GET
OUT OF HERE NOW.

10:17.317 --> 10:20.553
GRIFFIN MAY BE A GENIUS WHEN IT
COMES TO CORPORATE TAKEOVERS,

10:20.620 --> 10:24.324
BUT HE'S GOT THE CREATIVE
POP SENSIBILITY OF A WALNUT.

10:24.391 --> 10:27.360
- YOU SET UP A NICE,
PERFECT, SIMPLE SHOT.

10:27.427 --> 10:29.863
HOW BAD COULD HE MESS IT UP?

10:29.930 --> 10:32.933
- THIS IS REALLY MESSED UP.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.101
- OKAY.

10:34.167 --> 10:35.302
- OUR FIRST PICTURE,

10:35.368 --> 10:36.636
AND IT'S GOING
TO BRAND US FOREVER

10:36.704 --> 10:38.105
AS SPACE MATADORS!

10:38.171 --> 10:40.674
- THIS IS NOT GOING TO IMPRESS
MILLIONS OF GIRLS.

10:40.741 --> 10:42.676
I WOULD SAY SIX OR SEVEN MAX.

10:42.743 --> 10:45.578
- SMILE PRETTY, PRETTY.

10:48.615 --> 10:49.649
- WAIT.

10:49.717 --> 10:51.151
[all sigh]

10:51.218 --> 10:54.054
THE TEEN GIRL INSIDE ME
SAYS SOMETHING'S MISSING.

10:54.121 --> 10:55.255
all: YEAH.

10:55.322 --> 11:00.193
- MARCOS KNOWS WHAT IT IS.

11:00.260 --> 11:02.262
all: KENDALL.
- DON'T PANIC.

11:02.329 --> 11:05.065
IN THREE SECONDS, GUSTAVO
WILL BARGE THROUGH THAT DOOR

11:05.132 --> 11:08.401
AND FIX EVERYTHING,
LIKE HE ALWAYS DOES.

11:08.468 --> 11:09.937
ONE...

11:10.003 --> 11:13.040
TWO...

11:13.106 --> 11:16.143
- GIANT STUFFY PUPPIES
FOR EVERYONE.

11:16.209 --> 11:17.277
- THAT'S NOT GUSTAVO.

11:17.344 --> 11:19.346
- [laughs]

11:19.412 --> 11:21.581
ONE, TWO, THREE.
BEAUTIFUL.

11:21.648 --> 11:22.615
OKAY.

11:22.750 --> 11:23.917
- PERFECT.

11:23.984 --> 11:27.254
THE PHOTO IS NOW BOLD
AND CUTE AND CUDDLY.

11:27.320 --> 11:28.288
LET'S SHOOT IT.

11:28.355 --> 11:31.358
- SMILE PRETTY, PRETTY.

11:31.424 --> 11:35.062
- * AH, AH, AH-AH, OH *

11:35.128 --> 11:36.063
- OKAY.

11:36.129 --> 11:37.931
NOW WE PANIC.

11:41.869 --> 11:43.270
- OKAY, I GET IT.

11:43.336 --> 11:45.305
YOU GUYS DIDN'T WANT
TO LOOK LIKE SPACE MATADORS,

11:45.372 --> 11:46.940
BUT THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

11:47.007 --> 11:49.376
- TOP TEEN PHOTOGRAPHER MARCOS

11:49.442 --> 11:52.846
WAS ABOUT
TO TAKE THE PICTURE WHEN...

11:55.548 --> 11:56.784
WAIT!

11:56.817 --> 11:59.219
WE CAN'T TAKE THIS PHOTO.

11:59.286 --> 12:03.256
- WHY NOT?
- BECAUSE IT'S NOT FINISHED.

12:03.323 --> 12:06.426
I MEAN, SURE, IT'S BOLD AND...

12:06.493 --> 12:11.932
- AND CUTE AND CUDDLY,
BUT WE DON'T HAVE...

12:11.999 --> 12:12.966
- A SNOWMOBILE.

12:13.033 --> 12:14.601
- WHAT?
- A WHAT?

12:14.667 --> 12:16.136
SURE.

12:16.203 --> 12:21.108
WITH A SNOWMOBILE, YOU'RE BOLD,
CUDDLY, AND DANGEROUS.

12:21.174 --> 12:23.877
- IT'S THE POP PINUP HAT TRICK.

12:23.944 --> 12:28.315
- THE SPACE MATADORS ARE RIGHT.

12:28.381 --> 12:30.818
GET ME A SNOWMOBILE.

12:30.851 --> 12:32.719
- EVERYBODY TAKE FIVE
FOR A SNOWMOBILE BREAK.

12:32.820 --> 12:33.686
[all cheer]

12:37.324 --> 12:39.927
- WE CANNOT LET GRIFFIN
TAKE THIS PHOTO.

12:39.993 --> 12:42.095
BY THE WAY,
KUDOS ON THE SNOWMOBILE IDEA.

12:42.162 --> 12:44.464
- WHICH IS WHY I'M TAKING ONE
WITH ME ON MY DESERT ISLAND.

12:44.531 --> 12:47.067
- A DESERT ISLAND HAS
A TROPICAL CLIMATE, PROFESSOR.

12:47.134 --> 12:49.236
- WILL YOU JUST LET ME HAVE FUN
ON MY DESERT ISLAND?

12:49.302 --> 12:50.337
IT'S MINE.

12:50.403 --> 12:52.973
- WELL,
I'M TAKING MY LUCKY COMB.

12:53.040 --> 12:54.041
- BUT YOU'RE ALONE.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.275
NO ONE'S GONNA SEE YOUR HAIR.

12:55.342 --> 12:57.110
- HEY, I'M THERE.

12:57.177 --> 12:58.278
- FOCUS.

12:58.345 --> 12:59.746
all: RIGHT.

12:59.847 --> 13:01.714
- WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT A WAY
TO CHANGE THIS PHOTO.

13:01.849 --> 13:04.751
- YES, FROM CUDDLY
SPACE MATADORS TO...

13:04.852 --> 13:05.752
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

13:05.853 --> 13:07.220
- THERE HE IS!

13:07.287 --> 13:10.157
[all screaming]

13:12.259 --> 13:13.193
- IT'S NOT HIM.

13:13.260 --> 13:16.163
[all screaming]

13:23.203 --> 13:24.905
- LET'S PUT THIS PHOTO AWAY

13:24.972 --> 13:26.706
BEFORE SOMEBODY GETS KILLED,
SHALL WE?

13:26.773 --> 13:28.441
- RIGHT.

13:28.508 --> 13:30.710
NOW, WHERE'S GUSTAVO, 'CAUSE
HE SHOULD BE SAVING OUR PHOTO!

13:30.777 --> 13:32.512
- GUSTAVO'S NOT COMING BACK,

13:32.579 --> 13:35.682
WHICH MEANS WE HAVE TO DO THIS
ON OUR OWN.

13:35.748 --> 13:37.250
- OUCHIES.

13:41.488 --> 13:42.890
IS MY HEAD ON BACKWARDS?

13:42.923 --> 13:43.957
- NO.

13:44.024 --> 13:45.292
AND WE'RE IN CHARGE NOW.

13:45.358 --> 13:47.027
WHAT DO WE DO?

13:47.094 --> 13:49.529
- WE'RE GONNA TAKE
A SECRET PHOTO

13:49.596 --> 13:52.599
AND GIVE THAT TO THE POP TIGER
MESSENGER WHEN HE GETS HERE.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.334
- JAMES, YOU'RE IN CHARGE
OF WARDROBE.

13:54.401 --> 13:57.770
WE NEED COOLER CLOTHES.
NO OFFENSE TO MATADORS.

13:57.905 --> 14:00.073
LOGAN, WE NEED TO
GET THIS ROOM SUPER BRIGHT

14:00.140 --> 14:03.543
LIKE MARCOS' LIGHTS.

14:03.610 --> 14:05.913
AND CARLOS, YOU'RE GONNA
BREAK DOWN ANY DOOR

14:05.946 --> 14:08.615
THAT STANDS IN OUR WAY.

14:08.681 --> 14:11.351
- GREAT, BUT WE STILL NEED
A CAMERA AND A WHITE BACKDROP.

14:11.418 --> 14:14.454
- NO, WE JUST NEED A CAMERA.

14:14.521 --> 14:17.524
beep!

14:17.590 --> 14:19.026
- AND WHEN ARE WE GOING
TO DO ALL THIS?

14:19.092 --> 14:20.427
- WE'VE GOT PLENTY OF TIME.

14:20.493 --> 14:22.429
YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT'S GOING
TO TAKE GRIFFIN

14:22.495 --> 14:23.931
TO FIND A SNOWMOBILE IN L.A.?

14:23.997 --> 14:25.698
[engine revving]

14:25.765 --> 14:27.100
[all scream]

14:27.167 --> 14:28.401
- LOOK WHAT DADDY FOUND.

14:28.468 --> 14:32.172
NOW LET'S GO TAKE THAT PICTURE.

14:32.239 --> 14:35.142
[engine revving]

14:36.809 --> 14:38.178
- WE NEED TO GET BACK
TO THE STUDIO.

14:38.245 --> 14:41.248
THERE IS NO WAY THE DOGS
CAN HANDLE GRIFFIN WITHOUT ME.

14:41.314 --> 14:43.050
- YEAH, BUT HOW ARE WE GONNA
GET OUT OF HERE?

14:43.116 --> 14:44.451
- HERE'S THE PLAN.

14:44.517 --> 14:47.120
- KELLY, YOU START BY
TYING TOGETHER

14:47.187 --> 14:51.491
ALL THE GARBAGE BAGS
TO FASHION A CRUDE ZIP LINE.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.860
GUMS, YOU AND I WILL
MAKE DECOY DUMMIES

14:53.961 --> 14:57.864
OF DISCARDED NEWSPAPERS
AND EMPTY SODA CANS.

14:57.965 --> 14:59.366
- AND CORRECTIONS OFFICER,

14:59.432 --> 15:02.002
YOU STAND GUARD WHILE
THE CORRECTIONS OFFICER DOES--

15:02.069 --> 15:03.803
[moans]

15:03.870 --> 15:05.405
- NEW PLAN, RUN.

15:05.472 --> 15:09.176
- THIS WAY TO FREEDOM, GUMS!

15:09.242 --> 15:10.677
- GO ON!
I'LL HOLD 'EM OFF!

15:10.743 --> 15:13.680
- WE'LL NEVER FORGET YOU, GUMS!

15:18.118 --> 15:20.753
- [adopts French accent]
LUNCH DELIVERY FOR MR. ZEVON.

15:20.820 --> 15:23.991
- IS THAT THE SWEET SALMON
WITH POTATOES AND TARRAGON?

15:23.991 --> 15:25.892
- UH, YES.

15:25.993 --> 15:27.294
- THAT'S NOT WHAT HE ORDERED.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.298
- [laughs]

15:31.364 --> 15:35.335
HEY, FELLAS.
GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

15:35.402 --> 15:37.104
I TOLD YOU
THIS WASN'T GONNA WORK.

15:37.170 --> 15:41.008
- YOU KNOW, I THINK WE'RE ALL
GONNA LAUGH ABOUT THIS SOMEDAY.

15:41.074 --> 15:44.044
[knuckles cracking]

15:44.111 --> 15:46.146

15:46.213 --> 15:50.283

15:54.921 --> 15:56.523
THAT MAD, CRAZY LOOK
IN YOUR EYE.

15:56.589 --> 15:57.557

IS SO PUTTING THIS PICTURE

16:01.394 --> 16:02.762
ON HER WALL.

16:02.829 --> 16:07.300

SAYS WE NEED...

16:07.367 --> 16:09.336
ONE MORE STUFFY PUPPY.

16:09.402 --> 16:11.071

NOW SHOOT IT.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.377
- WAIT!

WE NEED MORE FOG.

16:22.782 --> 16:23.916

FOG IT UP.

16:25.085 --> 16:27.954
[all yelling at once]

16:37.164 --> 16:39.099

TOO MUCH FOG.

16:39.166 --> 16:40.400
