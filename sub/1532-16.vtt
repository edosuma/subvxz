00:02.240 --> 00:04.083
My name is Oliver Queen.

00:04.320 --> 00:05.924
After five years in hell...

00:06.160 --> 00:09.403
To save my city.

00:09.600 --> 00:11.443
Now others have joined my crusade.

00:12.600 --> 00:13.886
To them, I'm Oliver Queen.

00:14.400 --> 00:16.050
To the rest of Starling City...

00:16.239 --> 00:17.765
...I am someone else.

00:17.920 --> 00:20.605
I am something else.

00:20.800 --> 00:22.086
Previously on Arrow:

00:22.280 --> 00:23.441
I killed Sara.

00:23.680 --> 00:25.921
Malcolm gave me something
that made me...

00:26.120 --> 00:28.043
...susceptible to suggestion.

00:28.240 --> 00:31.289
What happened wasn't your fault, Thea.
It wasn't your decision.

00:31.440 --> 00:33.807
Malcolm, he's going to face justice.

00:33.960 --> 00:37.646
He's gone.
Malcolm Merlyn will never be seen again.

00:40.600 --> 00:41.931
Welcome to Nanda Parbat.

00:42.120 --> 00:45.647
When I told you that Malcolm killed Sara,
he wanted her dead...

00:45.840 --> 00:49.049
...but I am the one
who fired those arrows into her chest.

00:49.240 --> 00:51.242
I promised you your vengeance.

00:54.560 --> 00:56.449
So take it.

01:00.160 --> 01:03.642
Kill me, but spare John Diggle's life.

01:05.400 --> 01:06.731
Let him go.

01:09.360 --> 01:11.328
I will beg for it.

01:11.480 --> 01:13.482
You've shown tremendous strength...

01:13.640 --> 01:15.165
...fortitude...

01:15.360 --> 01:17.169
...and power.

01:19.120 --> 01:20.485
No, Mr. Queen.

01:21.760 --> 01:23.603
I don't want to kill you.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.684
I want you to take my place.

01:28.240 --> 01:30.971
I want you to become
the next Ra's al Ghul.

01:32.640 --> 01:35.644
Ra's is a title greater than any one man.

01:44.160 --> 01:46.288
Am I supposed to understand
what that means?

01:46.480 --> 01:50.530
No. It's from a dialect no longer spoken.

01:50.760 --> 01:53.491
Said to me by a man whose place I took.

01:54.440 --> 01:57.046
Contemplating the same offer.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.806
And what it means is:

02:00.000 --> 02:03.721
"The tale to be told begins thus."

02:38.240 --> 02:39.924
Don't let your footing betray you.

02:40.480 --> 02:42.926
Let your power come
not from the strength of your attack...

02:43.080 --> 02:45.048
...but from the ground
that holds your feet.

02:50.840 --> 02:52.251
All men seek guidance...

02:52.520 --> 02:54.443
...a purpose...

02:54.600 --> 02:57.080
...a means to live without pain.

02:57.600 --> 03:02.083
Those who journey here are given
such an exchange for their fealty.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.682
You mean, they have to kill for you.

03:09.240 --> 03:11.846
No, Mr. Queen, they have to die for me.

03:22.800 --> 03:25.371
Is all of this supposed to impress me?

03:26.360 --> 03:27.771
No.

03:28.280 --> 03:30.248
To inform you.

03:31.400 --> 03:33.562
Surely, men have branded you a murderer...

03:33.760 --> 03:35.285
...a torturer.

03:37.120 --> 03:40.090
You see, I would never shame you
with such bluntness.

03:42.040 --> 03:43.929
Because I see it in your eyes.

03:45.480 --> 03:48.529
The struggle you have
with your dual identity.

03:49.080 --> 03:51.082
Oliver Queen and the Arrow.

03:51.800 --> 03:54.167
Neither giving you what you crave.

03:54.320 --> 03:56.800
But becoming Ra's al Ghul will?

03:57.040 --> 04:00.840
Oliver Queen is a man destined to be alone.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.322
- He loves a woman he knows he cannot have.
- You don't know me.

04:05.520 --> 04:06.851
But I know the Arrow.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.048
Al Sah-Him...

04:09.200 --> 04:12.921
...will never be anything more than a
vigilante for those whose lives you save...

04:13.120 --> 04:14.565
...at the risk of your own.

04:15.840 --> 04:18.366
Your city will turn on you.

04:18.800 --> 04:22.964
And your closest allies within the police
department will call you a criminal.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.842
You will be scorned...

04:26.040 --> 04:27.530
...and hunted...

04:27.680 --> 04:28.966
...and then killed...

04:30.560 --> 04:33.609
...dying as you began your crusade.

04:36.360 --> 04:37.805
Alone.

04:52.560 --> 04:55.325
Your brother attempted to have me believe
that he killed Sara.

04:55.560 --> 04:57.324
Your confession is even less convincing.

04:57.560 --> 05:00.404
- I don't have a reason to lie.
- Except to protect your father.

05:00.600 --> 05:03.570
Why would I protect Malcolm,
when I turned him over to you?

05:04.880 --> 05:06.689
He gave me a drug called Votura.

05:06.880 --> 05:11.568
I put three arrows into her chest,
and I had no idea what I was doing.

05:11.720 --> 05:13.484
He used me.

05:14.800 --> 05:17.041
Someone she would trust.

05:18.120 --> 05:21.602
So I don't deserve to be living any more
than Malcolm does.

05:23.040 --> 05:25.008
There would be no justice in killing you.

05:25.520 --> 05:27.409
I killed Sara.

05:28.760 --> 05:30.364
Kill me.

05:31.600 --> 05:32.886
Do it!

05:33.320 --> 05:34.606
Do it.

05:36.720 --> 05:39.530
The blood debt ends with Malcolm's death.

05:40.640 --> 05:43.405
Which I can assure you
my father has taken care of already.

05:43.600 --> 05:45.728
- Thea!
- Get away from her!

05:52.240 --> 05:53.890
Nyssa, no!

06:04.360 --> 06:05.600
Are you okay?

06:06.960 --> 06:09.566
How the hell did she get out?

06:10.800 --> 06:12.962
It's League training. Probably.

06:13.200 --> 06:14.804
What were you doing down here?

06:14.960 --> 06:16.644
I just wanted to pay my respects.

06:21.480 --> 06:24.609
It was Herodotus
who first wrote of these waters.

06:24.800 --> 06:27.690
And Ponce de LeÃ³n traveled the earth
in search of them.

06:29.200 --> 06:33.569
And their discovery by Al-Khidr
is chronicled in the Qur'an.

06:34.880 --> 06:39.169
And they have permitted me
to live way beyond my time.

06:41.720 --> 06:44.644
You don't seem too fazed
by what I've told you.

06:46.160 --> 06:49.004
I've seen things
that have helped me to believe...

06:49.240 --> 06:53.325
...that this world is a much bigger place
than people realize.

06:54.480 --> 06:57.165
As I told you on the mountain, boy...

06:58.000 --> 07:00.287
...man can only evade death for so long.

07:02.160 --> 07:06.370
And these water's powers
are losing their effect on me.

07:07.840 --> 07:09.604
My time is almost over.

07:09.800 --> 07:12.246
But my legacy won't be just ash and bone.

07:12.440 --> 07:13.965
It will be history.

07:14.200 --> 07:17.727
And you think
that I'll help you secure that legacy.

07:17.920 --> 07:20.241
You survived my sword.

07:20.440 --> 07:24.047
Your resurrection wasn't a gift
from these waters...

07:24.280 --> 07:27.443
...but rather by force of your own will.

07:27.640 --> 07:32.202
What better heir to immortality than someone
who has already claimed victory over death?

07:32.360 --> 07:36.206
I didn't defy death
just to become an instrument of it.

07:36.720 --> 07:38.324
We are justice.

07:40.720 --> 07:43.530
Isn't that what
you've dedicated your life to?

07:43.880 --> 07:47.248
Why confine your crusade
to a single city...

07:49.040 --> 07:51.566
...when I can give you
a whole world to save?

07:51.760 --> 07:54.843
By executing anyone
who stands in my way?

07:57.160 --> 08:00.881
You would command resources
that you cannot even fathom.

08:01.160 --> 08:03.640
Numbers greater than any army.

08:03.840 --> 08:05.649
And more loyal.

08:08.240 --> 08:09.730
Now...

08:09.920 --> 08:13.049
...if you wish for them
to renounce killing as you did...

08:14.080 --> 08:16.048
...thy will be done.

08:16.240 --> 08:18.083
I doubt that.

08:18.280 --> 08:21.204
It's called the League of Assassins
for a reason.

08:22.080 --> 08:24.560
The League's reason would be your own.

08:25.760 --> 08:28.525
You would be Ra's al Ghul.

08:34.840 --> 08:36.443
And what if I say no?

08:44.880 --> 08:47.360
Then you are free to leave...

08:47.960 --> 08:49.928
...with your compatriots...

08:50.120 --> 08:52.521
...as a gesture of goodwill.

08:53.040 --> 08:54.883
All debts forgiven.

08:55.440 --> 08:57.249
And all blood oaths waived.

09:12.200 --> 09:13.850
Let's go home.

09:30.280 --> 09:33.648
We really need to stop having these
"Thank God you're not dead" reunions.

09:33.880 --> 09:35.291
- I agree.
- Heh.

09:35.480 --> 09:36.970
I'm working on it.

09:37.160 --> 09:40.243
- You look okay. Are you okay?
- I'm fine. Not even a scratch.

09:40.440 --> 09:41.726
How is that possible?

09:46.520 --> 09:49.091
- How did you get him back?
- Doesn't matter.

09:49.280 --> 09:51.248
What matters is, you didn't kill him.

09:51.480 --> 09:54.484
No, I wanted Ra's to kill him.

09:54.680 --> 09:56.887
- And I still do.
- Thea.

09:57.080 --> 09:58.366
He's not staying here.

09:58.560 --> 10:00.722
You know there's nowhere else
I can take him.

10:00.920 --> 10:03.082
If you think I feel bad
for him, you're wrong.

10:03.280 --> 10:06.727
I'm not asking you to feel bad for him.
I'm not asking you to forgive him.

10:07.880 --> 10:09.530
Just let him heal.

10:12.360 --> 10:14.089
I have to go.

10:21.080 --> 10:23.128
How did Thea react to her new houseguest?

10:23.320 --> 10:25.482
- Fine.
- That bad, huh?

10:26.400 --> 10:28.129
She ask how we made it back alive?

10:28.320 --> 10:30.368
- I didn't get into it with her.
- How about me?

10:30.600 --> 10:32.807
Like I said, Ra's had a change of heart.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.445
Ra's doesn't have a heart.

10:34.640 --> 10:37.450
He kicked you off a mountain,
put a sword through you.

10:37.640 --> 10:39.688
Now he's giving you Malcolm back
gift-wrapped?

10:39.880 --> 10:43.123
Diggle, we're back. We're alive.

10:43.320 --> 10:45.288
Let's just be grateful for that.

10:49.200 --> 10:50.725
What's the Chinese word for "okay"?

10:50.920 --> 10:53.810
Or how do you say "okay" in Mandarin?

10:55.400 --> 10:57.846
Everything is gonna be hao ba.

10:58.040 --> 11:00.088
- I wanna go home.
- Yeah, I know, buddy.

11:00.280 --> 11:02.851
But home's not really safe right now.

11:03.040 --> 11:04.724
Because those men tried to hurt us?

11:04.920 --> 11:07.844
Yeah, because of those men.

11:08.720 --> 11:11.690
In fact, Akio, we shouldn't be
out in the open right now.

11:12.160 --> 11:13.525
Akio!

11:25.600 --> 11:28.206
- Oliver?
- Hey. Hey.

11:28.400 --> 11:30.368
Hey, look, you cannot disappear like that.

11:30.560 --> 11:33.689
I thought I saw my father,
but it wasn't him.

11:33.920 --> 11:37.049
All right. Look, I get it, I get it.
I'm sorry.

11:37.640 --> 11:41.611
- We can't get separated.
- The botanical gardens.

11:41.840 --> 11:43.968
- The what?
- Mother and father always told me...

11:44.160 --> 11:46.288
...to go there if we ever got separated.

11:46.480 --> 11:48.926
- Okay.
- Come on!

11:54.880 --> 11:56.245
Well, thank God.

11:56.760 --> 11:59.889
Just because I'm furious with you,
that doesn't mean I want you dead.

12:00.080 --> 12:03.721
What about Malcolm? I mean, I know
Laurel wants him dead. I mean, is he?

12:03.920 --> 12:06.605
No. We got him back.

12:06.800 --> 12:10.930
Well, I suppose, "Congrats," and, "Why,
oh, why did you do that?" are in order.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.445
Oliver?

12:13.960 --> 12:17.089
- Oliver, what are you doing?
- You're free to go.

12:19.840 --> 12:22.605
My father would never trade
my life for yours.

12:22.840 --> 12:25.969
- He certainly wouldn't for Malcolm Merlyn's.
- He didn't.

12:26.160 --> 12:28.891
If no bargain was struck,
then how are you still alive?

12:29.080 --> 12:30.969
Go home, Nyssa.

12:35.200 --> 12:36.440
Okay...

12:36.640 --> 12:39.325
...well, I don't understand
anything anymore.

12:39.520 --> 12:41.602
- Why did Ra's...?
- It doesn't matter.

12:41.800 --> 12:43.404
Let's focus on what does.

12:43.600 --> 12:46.001
Somewhere, there is someone
that needs a reminder...

12:46.240 --> 12:48.322
...that we are still
watching over this city.

12:57.800 --> 13:01.646
There is a robbery in progress
at the Kingston Property Depot on 3rd.

13:01.880 --> 13:05.123
A new shipment just arrived.
Whatever it is, it's worth a lot of money.

13:05.320 --> 13:07.049
Okay, suit up.

13:07.360 --> 13:09.806
- Oliver...?
- Suit up.

13:13.080 --> 13:14.889
- I want this shipment done.
- Excuse me.

13:15.080 --> 13:18.129
We're looking for the Catoca shipment.
Maybe you could help.

13:21.400 --> 13:22.686
The Catoca shipment.

13:22.880 --> 13:25.611
- Where is it?
- Uh... I don't know.

13:28.520 --> 13:30.045
Sorry.

13:36.040 --> 13:39.647
Boss said check the crates
for a Catoca manifest.

14:01.680 --> 14:03.205
Drop it!

14:12.960 --> 14:14.405
Look out!

14:29.560 --> 14:31.483
You still need training.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.800
- When are you gonna stop telling me that?
- When you no longer need training.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.206
Arsenal?

14:37.400 --> 14:40.165
The head guy got away. With these.

14:53.640 --> 14:56.883
Ran into a new player tonight
who dropped some bodies.

14:57.120 --> 14:58.645
I need a name.

14:58.840 --> 15:01.923
- One of these four will give him up.
- Yeah.

15:02.360 --> 15:04.886
But when he does,
you can read about it in the papers.

15:08.320 --> 15:11.005
- Detective?
- It's captain now!

15:11.200 --> 15:13.726
When were you gonna tell me?
Or were you gonna tell me?

15:15.920 --> 15:18.002
You're really gonna stand there
still pretending...

15:18.160 --> 15:19.969
...you didn't know
my daughter was dead?

15:22.240 --> 15:24.641
- Captain Lance...
- My whole career...

15:24.840 --> 15:28.367
...my whole life, even when I knew nothing,
I, at least, knew right from wrong.

15:28.560 --> 15:30.164
And I knew vigilantism was wrong.

15:30.720 --> 15:33.724
The day we take the law
into our own hands is the day...

15:33.920 --> 15:35.570
...that we become outlaws.

15:35.760 --> 15:38.809
And that idea...
That idea was precious to me.

15:40.640 --> 15:43.211
Almost as precious as my own daughters.

15:45.440 --> 15:48.284
I threw that all away the day
I threw in with you.

15:48.480 --> 15:50.050
You know why?

15:51.440 --> 15:52.726
Because I trusted you.

15:54.200 --> 15:56.043
But I see the man under the hood now.

15:57.760 --> 16:00.809
He lies, and he keeps secrets.

16:02.320 --> 16:05.961
All so he doesn't have to carry around
the weight of his decisions.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.529
And I'm done with him.

16:18.480 --> 16:20.050
What would you say...

16:20.240 --> 16:24.450
...if I told you I just connected
the virtual TCP to the open-source sensor?

16:24.640 --> 16:26.449
I would say that you only think you did.

16:26.640 --> 16:29.166
I've been trying to figure that out
for over two weeks.

16:29.360 --> 16:34.127
If it makes you feel any better, I have
been trying for at least two full minutes.

16:34.320 --> 16:36.846
Ah. Let me see.

16:37.040 --> 16:39.042
Oh? You don't believe me?

16:39.240 --> 16:42.289
Well, no, I just wanna make sure
you did it right.

16:42.520 --> 16:43.681
Oh, and if I'm right?

16:43.880 --> 16:46.850
Then I will take you to the best
steak dinner you've ever had.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.684
Mm.

16:48.960 --> 16:51.486
Which I'd probably do anyway.

16:51.680 --> 16:53.762
I hope it's better than
that fusion place...

16:53.960 --> 16:56.804
...where I needed this microscope
to find the food.

16:58.400 --> 17:00.846
Oliver, hey. What are you doing here?

17:01.080 --> 17:03.401
I mean, it's nice to see you here.

17:03.600 --> 17:06.285
- Nice to see you again, Mr. Palmer.
- Likewise.

17:06.480 --> 17:08.130
And, please, call me Ray.

17:08.319 --> 17:12.405
Okay. Ray. May I speak with Felicity
for a few minutes please?

17:13.520 --> 17:15.761
- Uh, absolutely.
- Thank you.

17:22.400 --> 17:24.402
- I should have called.
- No.

17:24.640 --> 17:26.961
I should have told you earlier,
when you got back.

17:27.160 --> 17:29.128
- You don't owe me a thing.
- That's not true.

17:29.320 --> 17:31.482
You're one of my closest friends.

17:32.960 --> 17:36.646
We went up against a new crew last night.
One of them had his lips sewn shut.

17:36.840 --> 17:39.525
- Is that a real thing?
- Apparently.

17:40.240 --> 17:42.766
If only I had known I had that option.

17:43.880 --> 17:45.291
Okay.

17:48.040 --> 17:50.486
- Michael Amar?
- Yeah.

17:50.680 --> 17:53.524
Street name's Murmur
because of the whole lip-stitch thing.

17:54.360 --> 17:58.206
Practitioners say it focuses the mind,
like meditation.

17:59.200 --> 18:00.406
You Okay?

18:00.640 --> 18:03.803
I handed some of Amar's men
over to Lance.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.571
He knows the Arrow knew about Sara
and didn't tell him.

18:06.760 --> 18:08.125
What did Lance say?

18:08.320 --> 18:10.482
Some variation on "go to hell."

18:10.680 --> 18:12.967
- Oliver, he just needs time.
- No, he's right.

18:14.200 --> 18:17.010
I lied to him. For months.

18:17.480 --> 18:21.007
I kept something from him,
and he had every right to know.

18:21.240 --> 18:22.765
Are you okay?

18:23.880 --> 18:27.202
I mean, besides Lance and the whole,
well, me-and-Ray thing...

18:28.200 --> 18:30.680
It just seems like there's
something else going on...

18:30.920 --> 18:32.160
...underneath all of that.

18:32.360 --> 18:35.250
I'm fine. Thanks for help with Amar's name.

18:44.280 --> 18:47.329
- Oliver's not here.
- Actually, I came to see how you were doing.

18:48.040 --> 18:50.441
He told you that Malcolm was here?

18:52.400 --> 18:54.084
Go ahead.

18:54.280 --> 18:57.124
I'd be the last person to stop you
from killing him.

18:57.760 --> 19:01.082
My last attempt to do so
didn't exactly work out.

19:05.080 --> 19:08.129
That's kind of why I'm here.
I'm worried about you.

19:08.320 --> 19:11.688
Everyone's so interested
in saving my soul these days.

19:11.920 --> 19:15.527
Look, no one wants to see Merlyn dead
more than me...

19:17.080 --> 19:18.844
...but Oliver was right.

19:20.160 --> 19:22.288
You wanted your own father killed.

19:22.480 --> 19:24.084
Yeah, and how messed up is that?

19:26.160 --> 19:29.130
I wish that I never learned
Malcolm was my father.

19:30.200 --> 19:33.204
Everything since then has just...

19:39.440 --> 19:42.410
You know, you're lucky, Laurel.

19:43.720 --> 19:45.768
You have a normal father.

19:45.960 --> 19:47.883
Someone who really loves you.

19:48.120 --> 19:50.043
I can't say we're on the best of terms.

19:50.920 --> 19:52.490
- Yeah.
- Ugh, ahem.

19:53.920 --> 19:56.685
You should probably go.

20:03.760 --> 20:05.888
How much of that did you hear?

20:07.040 --> 20:11.648
Enough to know that I am the last person
you wish to see alive.

20:11.840 --> 20:14.286
I'm not gonna apologize for what I did.

20:14.840 --> 20:16.729
And I'd do it again.

20:17.920 --> 20:19.160
I know.

20:19.760 --> 20:22.240
You asked me to teach you to be strong.

20:23.200 --> 20:26.010
To make sure you can't be hurt again.

20:27.240 --> 20:28.924
You learned your lessons well.

20:29.160 --> 20:32.767
I have learned nothing from you.

20:33.760 --> 20:38.402
Do you realize that I'm so messed up
I was willing to die last night?

20:38.600 --> 20:40.807
For what you made me do.

20:42.760 --> 20:46.242
You know, I didn't actually think it was
possible for me to hurt any worse...

20:46.440 --> 20:48.249
...than I did when I came to you.

20:48.440 --> 20:50.920
You proved to me I was wrong.

20:52.840 --> 20:55.650
So, what was it again that you taught me?

20:55.840 --> 20:57.490
Show me the knife.

21:01.800 --> 21:03.245
How did you know?

21:03.440 --> 21:05.522
You are my daughter.

21:06.400 --> 21:09.722
Do it, like I taught you. One strike
to the neck, it'll be over quickly.

21:09.920 --> 21:11.604
You're sick.

21:11.800 --> 21:14.770
I love you. And I want to do
what is best for you.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.401
If that were even close to being true...

21:17.600 --> 21:20.285
...you would have stayed out of my life.

21:31.480 --> 21:33.005
Father.

21:34.200 --> 21:36.601
Your safe return pleases me, my child.

21:36.800 --> 21:40.247
Extend me the courtesy of explaining
why Malcolm Merlyn is still alive.

21:43.440 --> 21:45.681
If you're not going to watch your tongue...

21:45.880 --> 21:48.042
...then at least mind your tone.

21:48.280 --> 21:50.044
Why did you release
al-Sahfer's murderer?

21:50.280 --> 21:52.248
As a gift to Oliver Queen.

21:53.280 --> 21:55.169
In advance for him becoming my heir.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.571
You selected an outsider
over your own daughter?

21:58.760 --> 22:00.888
He survived my sword.

22:06.120 --> 22:07.565
Sara.

22:07.800 --> 22:10.201
You're punishing my love for her.

22:12.160 --> 22:16.529
At least do me the courtesy of
admitting it, you never approved.

22:16.720 --> 22:19.291
I never approved of you allowing
weakness into your life.

22:19.520 --> 22:23.491
And even in death, your devotion to her
pollutes your judgment.

22:59.040 --> 23:01.771
- Target's name is Michael Amar.
- Yeah. Got him here.

23:01.960 --> 23:04.247
Got out of Iron Heights two months ago.

23:04.480 --> 23:06.005
- He escaped?
- No, released.

23:06.200 --> 23:09.329
Turns out he was serving his sentence
based on a coerced confession.

23:09.520 --> 23:11.045
Cops beat it out of him.

23:11.640 --> 23:15.565
He confessed to a crime he didn't commit?
I might sew my mouth shut too.

23:15.760 --> 23:18.570
He's not innocent anymore.
What was he after tonight?

23:18.760 --> 23:21.650
His crew made off with a couple crates,
all containing these.

23:21.840 --> 23:23.205
Industrial-grade diamonds.

23:23.400 --> 23:26.244
The shipment was loaded
with high-end jewels they didn't take.

23:26.440 --> 23:28.090
Why steal worthless diamonds?

23:28.280 --> 23:31.250
- Million-dollar question.
- Street value's only a couple thousand.

23:31.440 --> 23:33.204
We could use Felicity on this, Oliver.

23:33.400 --> 23:35.164
She's preoccupied.

23:36.080 --> 23:39.971
I know a couple of fences
from my less socially-responsible days.

23:40.160 --> 23:43.721
I could talk to them, find out where
Amar's trying to move these diamonds.

23:43.920 --> 23:45.285
That's a good idea.

23:59.040 --> 24:01.281
You wanna tell me what's going on now?

24:04.000 --> 24:05.764
Ra's predicted this.

24:06.520 --> 24:10.320
He said that the city would turn
against me, and I would die alone.

24:12.160 --> 24:16.165
Then we come back and the first thing that
happens is, Lance is shutting me out...

24:17.440 --> 24:20.250
...and I see Felicity with Palmer.

24:21.520 --> 24:23.568
It's like he looked into my future.

24:23.760 --> 24:26.047
Sounds to me like Ra's is playing
with your head.

24:26.240 --> 24:27.924
Question is, why are you letting him?

24:28.120 --> 24:31.044
He wants me to take his place
in the League of Assassins.

24:32.720 --> 24:34.802
It's why he let us go.

24:35.320 --> 24:36.890
As a sign of good faith.

24:37.120 --> 24:40.488
Is there even a world
where he can imagine you saying yes?

24:40.680 --> 24:43.684
He said that I can do more as the new Ra's
than I could ever do...

24:43.880 --> 24:46.963
...as Oliver Queen or the Arrow.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.480
That I would have unlimited resources.

24:51.760 --> 24:54.161
That I could make a difference,
not just a dent.

24:54.360 --> 24:56.362
You're not really considering this?

24:57.080 --> 25:00.562
Just because Captain Lance is angry,
and Felicity is momentarily unavailable.

25:00.760 --> 25:02.524
It's more than that.

25:02.720 --> 25:04.210
I just...

25:06.320 --> 25:08.402
John, tell me honestly.

25:10.760 --> 25:12.888
What have we accomplished?

25:14.240 --> 25:15.446
Oliver.

25:15.640 --> 25:18.723
All the people that we put away, John,
they got out.

25:19.360 --> 25:22.523
The city's no better
off, the Arrow is not...

25:23.640 --> 25:25.483
He's not making a difference.

25:28.000 --> 25:31.686
And if I just can't be me...

25:34.960 --> 25:37.167
...and the Arrow isn't enough...
Oliver.

25:42.080 --> 25:44.970
...then maybe I should be Ra's al Ghul.

25:53.280 --> 25:55.089
Is Malcolm still alive?

25:55.440 --> 25:58.728
In my head I've already slit his throat
seven times.

25:59.040 --> 26:02.408
- Broke his neck twice.
- Sorry that I had to bring him here.

26:05.120 --> 26:08.681
Been trying to remember who I was
before Mom died.

26:11.160 --> 26:12.969
Before Malcolm.

26:16.080 --> 26:18.128
And I don't recognize her.

26:21.600 --> 26:23.887
I couldn't even fathom...

26:24.080 --> 26:26.287
...killing someone.

26:27.520 --> 26:29.727
And in the last month...

26:30.600 --> 26:33.206
...I've held a gun to
Slade Wilson's head...

26:33.440 --> 26:36.330
...and nearly took my father's life twice.

26:36.520 --> 26:38.807
But you didn't kill either of them.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.321
You know why I didn't kill Malcolm?

26:42.840 --> 26:44.365
Mom.

26:48.320 --> 26:53.963
About what she'd think about her daughter
becoming a murderer just like him.

26:54.160 --> 26:57.323
Thea, you're nothing like him.

26:58.280 --> 27:00.362
There's something broken inside of me...

27:00.560 --> 27:03.848
...just like there's something broken
inside of him.

27:07.640 --> 27:09.608
Nothing can change that.

27:11.560 --> 27:14.643
- Where are you going?
- To go buy my evil dad some soup.

27:20.760 --> 27:24.685
- One big happy family.
- What did you do to her?

27:24.880 --> 27:26.882
I encouraged her to kill me.

27:27.120 --> 27:30.124
My version of being a supportive father.

27:30.320 --> 27:32.687
- You really are insane.
- Perhaps.

27:32.920 --> 27:34.570
But I'm not the only one.

27:34.760 --> 27:37.843
Or do you doubt
that Ra's would release us both...

27:38.040 --> 27:40.771
...without conditions?

27:41.320 --> 27:42.765
No conditions.

27:43.960 --> 27:45.405
An offer.

27:46.480 --> 27:48.130
To take his place.

27:50.600 --> 27:52.329
You don't seem surprised.

27:52.560 --> 27:55.006
I don't put much stock in augury.

27:55.200 --> 27:56.804
But there is a prophecy.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.731
The man that doesn't perish
at the blade of Ra's al Ghul...

27:59.920 --> 28:02.764
...will become Ra's al Ghul.

28:08.440 --> 28:11.364
Ra's al Ghul doesn't offer, he orders.
Oliver.

28:13.320 --> 28:15.891
Don't delude yourself into thinking
you have a choice.

28:20.760 --> 28:23.366
Hey, what are those bamboo things called?

28:24.000 --> 28:26.401
Hey, Akio, come on, all right? It's okay.

28:27.480 --> 28:30.723
You need to remember that you're strong,
right? Just like my sister.

28:30.920 --> 28:32.490
- You have a sister?
- I do.

28:32.680 --> 28:35.729
And I miss her just as much
as you miss your parents.

28:35.920 --> 28:37.126
Why aren't you with her?

28:37.360 --> 28:40.489
Well, I told her that I had to hang out
with my good buddy, Akio.

28:40.680 --> 28:42.045
- Really?
- Yeah.

28:42.280 --> 28:45.602
We used to go to botanical gardens
just like these in Starling City.

28:45.800 --> 28:49.771
Except she didn't know the plants
as well as you do.

28:52.360 --> 28:54.647
Oliver, what's wrong?

28:57.640 --> 28:59.130
Run.

29:02.120 --> 29:03.485
Hi.

29:04.080 --> 29:06.560
- Where's Diggle?
- He's out with Roy.

29:06.800 --> 29:08.290
They're on their way back.

29:08.960 --> 29:10.246
Thanks for coming.

29:10.840 --> 29:12.763
Where else would I be?

29:12.960 --> 29:15.201
It's not rhetorical.
Ray and I may be something...

29:15.440 --> 29:17.920
...but that doesn't change
my commitment here.

29:18.120 --> 29:21.488
- Good.
- What about your commitment?

29:23.080 --> 29:26.527
John might have told me about your
employment offer from Evil Incorporated.

29:26.720 --> 29:29.451
He also might have told me
that you may be considering it...

29:29.640 --> 29:32.325
...which is, by the way, insane.

29:33.680 --> 29:35.444
They're the League of Assassins.

29:35.640 --> 29:37.768
That is not the name of a nice group.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.604
I've been an assassin.

29:41.080 --> 29:43.765
There is more than one path to justice.

29:44.440 --> 29:47.205
There are a lot of different ways
I can answer that.

29:47.400 --> 29:50.882
All varying on the theme
of, "You're crazy."

29:51.080 --> 29:52.320
But I'm gonna go with:

29:52.560 --> 29:55.484
What makes you think
that you're not already on the right path?

29:55.680 --> 29:57.762
Okay. Okay.

29:57.960 --> 30:01.203
Because it's been over two years.
You tell me.

30:02.760 --> 30:05.081
What have I really accomplished?

30:06.680 --> 30:08.409
My mother's dead.

30:08.600 --> 30:10.568
Tommy, Sara.

30:10.760 --> 30:15.641
Crime's not down, and my sister
is in 10 different kinds of pain right now.

30:15.840 --> 30:19.287
So, you leave. Then what?

30:20.160 --> 30:22.845
All the people you've lost,
all the sacrifices you've made.

30:23.040 --> 30:24.849
It would have been for nothing.

30:27.200 --> 30:30.044
I don't know why I'm doing this anymore.

30:31.480 --> 30:34.927
I can't answer that for you.

30:35.920 --> 30:38.969
Yes, Captain Lance is shutting you out.

30:39.160 --> 30:42.721
But I don't believe you're the Arrow
so that people can say thank you.

30:43.160 --> 30:46.881
And, yes, you and I are not together,
but that was your choice.

30:48.920 --> 30:50.922
When we thought you were dead...

30:51.560 --> 30:55.804
...each one of us had to figure out
why we were doing all this.

30:58.840 --> 31:00.126
Seems like it's your turn.

31:01.280 --> 31:03.362
Are we interrupting something?

31:04.880 --> 31:06.166
What do you have?

31:06.360 --> 31:10.046
Talked to a friend who ran a munitions
depot back when I was in Afghanistan.

31:10.240 --> 31:12.891
I know why our guy is so interested
in low-grade diamonds.

31:13.080 --> 31:16.368
The type Amar was interested in
is used to make diamond-tipped bullets.

31:16.600 --> 31:18.602
They go through body armor
like tissue paper.

31:18.800 --> 31:21.724
- Okay, so who wears body armor?
- The police.

31:21.920 --> 31:25.845
The guys who beat that false confession
out of him, put him in prison.

31:26.040 --> 31:28.771
- He's going to get payback.
- Okay, Roy, suit up.

31:28.960 --> 31:31.611
Dig, secure the perimeter
of the station. Felicity...

31:31.800 --> 31:33.723
Call Captain Lance. I'm already on it.

31:51.480 --> 31:53.130
Hi.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.490
Peace offering.

31:58.720 --> 32:01.246
- I already ate.
- Right.

32:03.800 --> 32:05.484
You know, it's funny.

32:06.680 --> 32:09.331
A friend of mine is having trouble
with her father.

32:10.320 --> 32:13.563
A son of a bitch who's barely human,
butyouuu

32:14.640 --> 32:19.931
You know, history's taught me that you'll
give me the cold shoulder for a while.

32:20.480 --> 32:23.529
And then you'll move on
to blowing up at me.

32:23.720 --> 32:24.960
And then finally...

32:25.160 --> 32:28.801
...you'll let it all out at a dinner
I've dragged you to after days of pleading.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.287
But my point is, is just let me have it.

32:32.000 --> 32:36.085
I deserve every minute of it,
and I am ready to take it.

32:36.280 --> 32:40.729
But don't you think for one second
that I am giving up on us.

32:43.040 --> 32:45.122
When you were a little girl...

32:45.320 --> 32:47.687
...you used to wait up for me
when I was on nights.

32:47.880 --> 32:50.486
You couldn't fall asleep
until I walked in that door.

32:50.680 --> 32:51.886
- I remember.
- Yeah.

32:52.080 --> 32:55.129
You were always the protector
of this family, of everyone.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.684
Laurel Lance...

32:58.560 --> 33:00.927
...always trying to save the world.

33:04.080 --> 33:05.570
You can't save this.

33:05.760 --> 33:07.922
- Dad...
- You don't know how hard I've tried...

33:08.120 --> 33:10.600
...to forgive you for lying to me
the way you did.

33:12.640 --> 33:14.608
I'm not proud of it.

33:14.840 --> 33:19.084
You're my daughter, I'll always love you,
but I don't know if I'll ever forgive you.

33:31.800 --> 33:33.689
Kill them all!

33:42.720 --> 33:44.051
Duck!

33:51.200 --> 33:54.044
Police band is filled with reports
of gunfire at the precinct.

33:54.240 --> 33:56.811
- Any luck getting to Lance?
- Still trying.

33:58.160 --> 33:59.207
Get down.

33:59.400 --> 34:02.563
- I'll lay down cover fire, haul ass for the exit.
- I'm not leaving you.

34:02.760 --> 34:05.570
Regardless of what you think,
I'm gonna protect my daughter.

34:05.760 --> 34:07.489
Now, on my move, you run!

34:07.680 --> 34:09.808
Go, go, go!

34:36.440 --> 34:37.885
My father's back there.

34:52.080 --> 34:53.764
Go, go, go!

35:20.480 --> 35:21.925
Hey!

35:51.400 --> 35:53.289
What, are you waiting for a "thank you"?

35:53.480 --> 35:55.164
That's not why I do this.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.604
Nice work.

36:11.760 --> 36:16.607
Not without a few casualties,
but Amar is in custody.

36:16.840 --> 36:19.161
So it's a "no"
on the whole victory-dance thing, then?

36:19.400 --> 36:20.765
You know me, I don't dance.

36:21.440 --> 36:24.728
But I do occasionally say, "Thank you."

36:24.920 --> 36:26.001
You're welcome.

36:26.960 --> 36:28.689
And you were right.

36:28.880 --> 36:33.488
A "thank you" and a "you were right."
I should really be recording this.

36:35.440 --> 36:38.569
I started all of this
because of my father...

36:40.040 --> 36:41.371
...to right his wrongs.

36:41.560 --> 36:44.609
It became something more.

36:45.720 --> 36:48.724
But I never stopped to think about it...

36:48.920 --> 36:51.810
...or about why...

36:52.800 --> 36:54.290
...until you asked me to.

36:54.520 --> 36:55.885
Well, what was the answer?

36:56.080 --> 36:58.287
Tonight, at the precinct...

36:58.960 --> 37:03.966
...the only thing that I could think about
was those police officers.

37:05.600 --> 37:09.241
And how their families
were counting on me...

37:09.800 --> 37:12.087
...and Roy and Diggle...

37:13.160 --> 37:15.162
...to get them home safe.

37:18.480 --> 37:19.970
That's why I'm doing this.

37:20.160 --> 37:21.491
So...

37:22.320 --> 37:24.402
...that means a pass...

37:24.600 --> 37:28.286
...on becoming the most handsome
Demon's Head ever?

37:28.480 --> 37:31.848
It means I'm not ready to give up
on what we're doing here.

37:33.120 --> 37:37.250
You know, you're always saying
how you just want me to be happy.

37:39.360 --> 37:41.169
The thing is...

37:42.840 --> 37:45.525
...as long as you're in my life, I am.

37:56.600 --> 37:58.045
I should probably take this.

38:02.960 --> 38:05.531
- Who are those men?
- I don't know.

38:05.720 --> 38:07.882
Then why are we running away from them?

38:12.160 --> 38:13.730
Shado?

38:19.280 --> 38:21.169
Are you all right?

38:22.600 --> 38:24.170
What are you doing here?

38:25.720 --> 38:27.722
Looking for you, actually.

38:29.320 --> 38:30.651
I missed your sister.

38:31.400 --> 38:33.607
I suppose I wanted something
to remind me of her.

38:33.800 --> 38:35.529
Now's really not the best time.

38:35.720 --> 38:38.530
Are you having problems with your father?

38:39.240 --> 38:41.561
I have some experience in that area.

38:44.720 --> 38:47.326
- Do you want to talk about it?
- With you?

38:53.160 --> 38:54.650
You know what?

38:56.640 --> 38:59.007
I could use a reminder of Sara too.

39:00.440 --> 39:01.885
Dinner's on me.

39:04.560 --> 39:07.689
During the fighting,
your technique was competent.

39:08.440 --> 39:10.761
Why do I feel like that's your idea
of a compliment?

39:10.920 --> 39:13.161
It could certainly be improved.

39:14.560 --> 39:16.608
Is that an offer to teach me?

39:17.280 --> 39:19.521
I have nowhere else to go.

39:27.800 --> 39:30.804
It is not customary for
one to wait so long...

39:30.960 --> 39:34.282
...before accepting a great honor.
I'm not accepting it.

39:36.800 --> 39:40.361
- "The tale to be told begins thus."
- Maseo, this story...

39:40.600 --> 39:42.045
...it's over before it begins.

39:42.240 --> 39:43.651
You misunderstand.

39:43.800 --> 39:46.406
It does not mean the tale is yet to unfold.

39:46.600 --> 39:49.809
It means Ra's has already written it.

39:50.480 --> 39:52.687
- The choice has been made.
- No.

39:55.200 --> 39:59.728
I will always be grateful
for what you've done for my family.

39:59.920 --> 40:02.161
For what you meant to Akio.

40:03.320 --> 40:07.006
But if you insist on pursuing this path
of resistance...

40:08.000 --> 40:10.446
...there will be consequences.
Is that a threat?

40:10.640 --> 40:13.007
It is the will of Ra's al Ghul.

40:22.320 --> 40:23.970
Yeah, who is it?

40:30.800 --> 40:32.006
Hello?

40:39.320 --> 40:42.051
Thea, are you okay? What's going on?

40:42.680 --> 40:45.968
I don't know what I'm doing anymore.

40:47.360 --> 40:49.681
I don't know who I am.

40:50.320 --> 40:52.004
Can I just stay here with you?

40:53.200 --> 40:54.440
Yeah.

41:18.480 --> 41:20.164
Cops believe they've won.

41:20.360 --> 41:21.407
But we still got what?

41:22.160 --> 41:24.891
How many rounds
of those armor-piercing diamond bullets?

41:40.920 --> 41:44.686
You tell everyone who'll listen
what you've seen.

41:45.880 --> 41:47.086
Go.
