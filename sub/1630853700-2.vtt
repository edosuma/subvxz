00:01.001 --> 00:02.741
- I didn't get the job.

00:02.785 --> 00:05.005
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I didn't want anyone to know.

00:05.048 --> 00:06.180
Not until I figure
something else out.

00:06.223 --> 00:07.659
- There's nothing wrong with me.

00:07.703 --> 00:09.096

- All this goes in the plane,
where you go. Got it?

00:11.228 --> 00:13.274
- Wheezer's out of surgery,
his back's broken,

00:13.317 --> 00:14.710
but he can wiggle his toes.

00:14.753 --> 00:15.841

is looking into it.

00:15.885 --> 00:17.321

that you want,

00:23.588 --> 00:25.112
but why did you have to go
after her?

00:25.155 --> 00:27.288

wondering how I jumped ahead
to go fight line.

If they found out
I got this job on Wheezer's
broken back...

01:33.136 --> 01:35.617
- You're a good pilot.
You did your time ramping.

01:35.660 --> 01:37.227
And what happened to Wheezer
wasn't your fault.

this is a good idea?

- Never lost a phone yet.
- But we're on duty.

is downtime.

if we're doing laundry

02:06.126 --> 02:07.866

in 15 minutes if we get a call.

02:12.436 --> 02:14.395
- And the airport is
a seven-minute drive away.

what blood vessels

that might have punctured,
so if we pull it out now,

06:13.373 --> 06:15.375

Text you later?

09:28.916 --> 09:30.526
[♪]

09:34.574 --> 09:36.706
Want me to get his number
for you, Novak?

09:37.707 --> 09:40.580
- Amateur move,
letting him stay the night.

09:43.060 --> 09:45.193
- Morning to you too, sunshine.

09:46.324 --> 09:48.022
[indistinct radio chatter]

09:51.982 --> 09:53.593
- Why isn't the plane loaded?

09:53.636 --> 09:55.899
Bodie and I are supposed to take
a load of medical supplies

09:55.943 --> 09:57.814
up to North House
on our schedevacs...

09:59.599 --> 10:02.253
- Someone must have skipped
those instructions...

10:02.776 --> 10:04.691
Kind of like how you jumped
over me and two other guys

10:04.734 --> 10:06.301
to go flight line, huh?

10:08.608 --> 10:11.872
If you're gonna sit in my plane,
you can load it, too.

10:14.309 --> 10:15.789
[forklift beeping]

10:28.236 --> 10:30.455
[phone rings]

10:31.892 --> 10:34.285
- Ah, there's my baby!

10:34.329 --> 10:36.331
Oh, we've been trying you
all weekend.

10:36.374 --> 10:38.638
- Hey, Mom. Uh, been busy.

10:39.290 --> 10:40.596
Lots of calls.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.293
- You get word
from Air Canada yet?

10:42.337 --> 10:45.253
- Everyone is so excited
about having you back home.

10:45.296 --> 10:47.255
Grandma's really hoping
you'll be home in time

10:47.298 --> 10:48.343
for Thanksgiving.

10:48.386 --> 10:50.954
- About that,
it's not great news.

10:51.607 --> 10:52.652
Uh...

10:54.175 --> 10:56.133
AC isn't starting their ground
school until next fall.

10:56.177 --> 10:57.831
- Oh, well...

10:57.874 --> 11:00.790
At least you'll be home
in time for Christmas, then.

11:00.834 --> 11:02.923
What about Madison,
is she coming too?

11:02.966 --> 11:04.751
Oh, we'll finally get
to meet her.

11:04.794 --> 11:07.492
- Yeah, I don't know,
things with Madison are...

11:07.536 --> 11:08.842
complicated.

11:08.885 --> 11:10.931
- No way, is that
Ryan and Denise?

11:10.974 --> 11:13.368
- Oh! Hi, Jay!
- Hey!

11:13.411 --> 11:15.936
- Did Austen share the cookies
I sent back with him?

11:15.979 --> 11:19.200
- He tries to hide them, but
I know where he keeps his stash.

11:20.157 --> 11:23.073
- Don't worry, Chopper.
You'll join Austen at
Air Canada soon enough.

11:23.117 --> 11:25.989
And you'll always have a bed
with us in Forest Hill,
if you need it.

11:26.033 --> 11:27.425
[chuckles]

11:27.469 --> 11:28.644
- Uh...

11:28.688 --> 11:30.690
Got to go, got to be up in 10.

11:31.429 --> 11:32.779
- Bye, honey! Bye!
- Bye!

11:32.822 --> 11:33.910
- Bye!

11:33.954 --> 11:34.824
[beep!]

11:37.261 --> 11:38.262
- Alright, look.

11:39.394 --> 11:40.743
I called a few buddies.

11:40.787 --> 11:42.266
West Jet's got a ground school
coming up,

11:42.310 --> 11:44.878
Pasco too, they gave me
all the "deets",

11:44.921 --> 11:47.315
I can ask one of them to walk
your resume in if you want.

11:47.358 --> 11:48.490
- What's the point?

11:48.533 --> 11:50.710
I don't even know
why AC didn't hire me.

11:50.753 --> 11:53.060
Why would anyone else?
- Okay, Bodes, AC's fickle.

11:53.103 --> 11:55.584
Everyone knows that.
Alright, you're a good pilot.

11:55.627 --> 11:57.412
- Look, I can't be
stuck up here.

11:59.370 --> 12:00.894
This can't be my life.

12:06.508 --> 12:08.553
What the hell is this?
We're supposed to be
wheels up in 10.

12:08.597 --> 12:10.642
- Yeah, that box or two
of medical supplies

12:10.686 --> 12:12.296
turned out to be an entire skid.

12:12.993 --> 12:14.995
- You know, it's bad enough
they got us moving supplies

12:15.038 --> 12:16.953
like we're goddamn cargo,
but you don't even have it
loaded yet?

12:16.997 --> 12:18.389
Total bush league.

12:18.433 --> 12:20.652
Now, I'm the asshole who has
to push the schedevac.

12:20.696 --> 12:22.393
Get your shit together, Martine.

12:22.437 --> 12:23.743
[sighs]

12:24.874 --> 12:25.875
[grunts]

12:27.877 --> 12:29.270
[dramatic music]

12:30.401 --> 12:32.099
[indistinct radio chatter]

12:33.274 --> 12:34.492
- Flaps approach.

12:35.319 --> 12:36.538
- You're high, you're fast,

12:36.581 --> 12:37.800
you gotta get some drag out,
dirty up.

12:37.844 --> 12:39.933
[tense music]

12:42.892 --> 12:44.807
- Yeah, if you'd
given me a chance,

12:44.851 --> 12:46.026
I was just about
to call for that.

12:46.069 --> 12:47.723
Gear down, props forward.

12:47.767 --> 12:50.421
- Gear down,
confirm three green.

12:51.118 --> 12:51.988
- Confirmed.

12:52.032 --> 12:54.077
Flaps down, landing checklist.

13:07.656 --> 13:09.266
- Who crapped in your headset?

13:09.310 --> 13:11.747
- You train people your way,
I'll train people my way.

13:12.661 --> 13:14.271
- This isn't your usual way.

13:14.315 --> 13:15.969
You gonna tell her
about that door?

13:17.840 --> 13:20.364
- Yeah. Later,
when she secures the cabin.

13:24.412 --> 13:25.805
[soft music]

13:30.548 --> 13:32.333
- I didn't know it was this bad.

13:32.376 --> 13:35.249
- Yeah, Wheezer's lucky
he only broke his back.

13:36.641 --> 13:39.209
- Oh, did the sun come out,
or is that just Crystal?

13:39.253 --> 13:40.384
- Astum!

13:40.428 --> 13:41.951
Grab a box, rampie.

13:41.995 --> 13:43.953
- You know I love
that Big Auntie energy.

13:43.997 --> 13:45.389
[light music]

13:49.437 --> 13:52.092
Hey, what's up, fly boy?

13:52.135 --> 13:53.789
[indistinct chatter]

13:57.706 --> 13:59.534
[soft music]

14:09.196 --> 14:12.155
[rhythmic music]

14:14.941 --> 14:16.943
- Dude, puck dropped
five minutes ago.

14:16.986 --> 14:18.248
- Satellite's probably
just stuck.

14:18.292 --> 14:19.815
We'll have reception in no time.

14:19.859 --> 14:20.947
- We should go to Corey's.

14:20.990 --> 14:22.339
He's got the new PS5.

14:22.383 --> 14:25.342
- No! No, just give me,
like, five minutes.

14:28.345 --> 14:30.478
[suspenseful music]

14:31.609 --> 14:33.046
[metal creaking]

14:33.089 --> 14:34.351
[insects buzzing]

14:36.832 --> 14:38.007
[yelps]

14:40.967 --> 14:42.577
[engine roaring]

14:43.360 --> 14:44.796
- It's what the astronauts use.

14:46.102 --> 14:47.669
It can write in zero gravity.

14:48.365 --> 14:49.845
My engineering buddies
sent it to me,

14:49.889 --> 14:51.673
but you gotta try it
upside down.

14:51.716 --> 14:52.935
- You applying to West Jet?

14:52.979 --> 14:54.763
You don't have enough PIC hours.

14:55.677 --> 14:58.419
- Oh, uh...
Just checking out the options.

14:59.202 --> 15:00.421
For a friend.

15:02.510 --> 15:04.642
The friend who sent me the pen.

15:05.382 --> 15:07.123
As, you know, a thank you.

15:07.167 --> 15:08.733
- The engineer?

15:09.691 --> 15:10.953
- Yeah, he...

15:10.997 --> 15:12.607
...has lots of PIC time.

15:14.914 --> 15:17.525
- Just wanted to impress
the guys on the hockey team
before tryouts.

15:17.568 --> 15:19.266
Now, I won't be able to play.

15:19.309 --> 15:21.094
- You just moved up here, huh?

15:22.051 --> 15:23.096
Me too.

15:23.966 --> 15:25.576
- Got any tips?

15:25.620 --> 15:27.230
- Everyone warns you
about the bears,

15:27.274 --> 15:29.972
but they're more friendly
then some of the locals.

15:30.016 --> 15:32.279
- Pro-tip, just do you.

15:32.322 --> 15:34.977
If they get that, great.
If they don't, screw them.

15:35.021 --> 15:37.937
You don't always have
to be friends with everyone
you work with.

15:38.502 --> 15:40.765
Novak gives Oscar a run
for his trash can.

15:40.809 --> 15:42.854
We still fly with him, though.
[laughs]

15:42.898 --> 15:44.030
[beeping]

15:44.073 --> 15:45.248
- My...

15:46.249 --> 15:47.511
My chest feels tight.

15:47.555 --> 15:48.991
[beeping quickens]

15:49.035 --> 15:50.166
My skin hurts.
- It's anaphylaxis.

15:50.210 --> 15:52.212
His symptoms are recurring.
[grunts]

15:52.255 --> 15:54.301
Administering 0.3 milligrams
of epinephrine,

15:54.344 --> 15:56.259
we'll stay on him
every 15 minutes.

15:56.303 --> 15:58.087
- Starting high dose
supplemental oxygen.

15:58.131 --> 15:59.393
[dramatic music]

16:00.655 --> 16:02.265
- Call Winnipeg,
have them send an ambulance.

16:02.309 --> 16:03.788
Stay with us, Evan.

16:04.920 --> 16:06.922
[soft country music]

16:12.319 --> 16:14.712
- Stop the truck.
- What?

16:14.756 --> 16:16.410
- Stop the truck!
- Okay.

16:19.152 --> 16:20.240
[music shuts off]

16:21.197 --> 16:22.155
[door closes]

16:26.333 --> 16:29.336
Ooh, hey, are you that eager
to be alone?

16:30.728 --> 16:32.165
- You're gonna tell me
about this box

16:32.208 --> 16:34.036
you took from Wheezer's
plane crash?

16:34.080 --> 16:36.343
Or would that get you in trouble
with your hunting buddies?

16:37.692 --> 16:39.302
- All you had to do
was ask, Crys.

16:39.346 --> 16:40.347
[chuckles]

16:40.390 --> 16:41.783
Go ahead, take a look.

16:45.352 --> 16:46.918
Don't get too excited,
that's a...

16:46.962 --> 16:49.704
genuine water pump there,
for my neighbour's house.

16:51.967 --> 16:53.708
[tense music]

16:59.975 --> 17:01.150
[sighs]

17:04.414 --> 17:06.068
Come on, Crys.

17:06.112 --> 17:07.809
The community might be dry,
but this stuff's coming up

17:07.852 --> 17:09.289
whether you like or not, yeah?

17:09.332 --> 17:10.638
At least, if I'm the one
bringing it,

17:10.681 --> 17:12.074
I can make sure it's not
something worse.

17:14.903 --> 17:16.948
- Oh, you're trying to act good
now, Crys, is that it?

17:16.992 --> 17:18.254
We both know, before you left,

17:18.298 --> 17:19.516
you were running
the stuff with me.

17:19.560 --> 17:21.431
- Only because I was young
and stupid enough

17:21.475 --> 17:22.780
to think I was in love with you.

17:22.824 --> 17:24.304
[soft music]

17:32.138 --> 17:34.053
- The ice roads are getting
less reliable every year.

17:35.010 --> 17:36.968
The prices at the Northern Store
are skyrocketing

17:37.012 --> 17:38.753
and people can't afford
what they need anymore.

17:39.362 --> 17:40.929
I'm just doing what I can
to help them.

17:40.972 --> 17:43.279
And yeah, if having a whiskey
pipeline gives me the tools

17:43.323 --> 17:45.368
to bring up the stuff
we actually need,

17:45.412 --> 17:47.109
well... fine with me.

17:48.763 --> 17:50.330
- You know what,
they're my people too.

17:50.982 --> 17:52.854
I care about the community.

17:52.897 --> 17:55.813
And you keeping your crap
away from my airline.

17:55.857 --> 17:57.598
[dramatic music]

18:12.743 --> 18:15.094
- Back to YWG, lady and gents.

18:15.137 --> 18:17.661
Oh, don't forget to give us
five stars, please.

18:17.705 --> 18:20.577
- Fuel run first?
It's impossible to get
a good coffee in Thompson.

18:20.621 --> 18:23.493
I mean, I can barely find
a basic caramel creamer
out there.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.757
So, unless we get a page
saying someone's dying,

18:26.801 --> 18:28.933
we're caffeinating.
My treat.

18:28.977 --> 18:31.240
- Hey, how's the kid?
Is he... gonna be okay?

18:31.284 --> 18:33.286
- Yeah, they got the reaction
under control.

18:33.329 --> 18:35.636
I've never seen
anaphylaxis return

18:35.679 --> 18:37.203
without a second
exposure before.

18:37.246 --> 18:38.291
- Yeah, it can happen.

18:38.334 --> 18:40.380
It's more common
in younger kids.

18:40.423 --> 18:42.295
My brother had nut allergies.

18:43.296 --> 18:45.515
- Had? Is that something
you can grow out of?

18:46.777 --> 18:48.344
[sighs]

18:48.388 --> 18:51.869
- The secret to winning anyone
over is to know their drinks.

18:52.827 --> 18:54.568
Crystal likes a green tea
with honey,

18:54.611 --> 18:56.918
Chopper takes an oat mocha frap

18:56.961 --> 19:00.748
and Novak likes a small black,
like his heart.

19:02.663 --> 19:04.708
- That wasn't a bad landing,
once you dirtied up.

19:05.666 --> 19:08.103
You need to bond the plane
first, to prevent sparks.

19:09.235 --> 19:10.584
And another thing--
- Look.

19:10.627 --> 19:12.412
I've had my licence
since I was 14

19:12.455 --> 19:14.544
and I've been fuelling planes
with my dad since I could walk.

19:14.588 --> 19:16.024
I know how to bond a plane.

19:18.679 --> 19:19.897
You and I...

19:20.289 --> 19:22.204
We're supposed to have
each other's backs.

19:22.944 --> 19:24.728
[soft music]

19:27.601 --> 19:28.645
[car horn honks]

19:32.736 --> 19:34.260
- Wheels up in five!

19:37.176 --> 19:39.526
Secure the cabin, our clearance
expires in three minutes.

19:39.961 --> 19:41.223
Today, Martine!

19:41.267 --> 19:42.442
- Okay.

19:46.881 --> 19:48.361
- Lines up all the way.

19:50.014 --> 19:51.102
- Strobe lights.

19:51.146 --> 19:52.626
- On.
- Auto-ignition.

19:52.669 --> 19:54.323
- Armed.
- Annunciators?

19:55.324 --> 19:57.326
- Check.
- Line ups complete.

19:57.979 --> 19:59.850
- You have control, punch it.

20:06.292 --> 20:07.554
Auto-feather armed.

20:07.597 --> 20:08.946
- Set max power.

20:08.990 --> 20:10.121
[dramatic music]

20:11.601 --> 20:14.430
- Reject! I have control.
- You have control.

20:17.346 --> 20:19.000
- Taxi back and try again,

20:19.043 --> 20:20.523
and fix that goddamn door,
Martine!

20:22.743 --> 20:23.570
[sighs]

20:24.353 --> 20:25.180
[grunts]

20:25.224 --> 20:26.399
[panting]

20:29.358 --> 20:31.099
[sombre music]

20:33.754 --> 20:34.842
- Hey, Bodie.

20:36.322 --> 20:38.280
Don't you ever
pull shit like that

20:38.324 --> 20:39.890
when I have a patient
on board again.

20:39.934 --> 20:42.719
No, look, I get that you're
taking something out on Lexi,

20:42.763 --> 20:44.460
but setting her up with a door

20:44.504 --> 20:46.767
when I have a patient
on board was wrong.

20:46.810 --> 20:48.116
What...

20:48.159 --> 20:50.118
Maybe you don't give a crap
about this job

20:50.161 --> 20:51.859
now that you're leaving,
but I do.

20:51.902 --> 20:53.034
And as long as you're here,

20:53.077 --> 20:54.775
you better act like you do too.

20:57.256 --> 20:58.344
- Austen.

21:02.130 --> 21:04.132
I hear congratulations
are in order.

21:04.698 --> 21:06.526
When do we lose you
to Air Canada?

21:06.569 --> 21:07.918
- Not for a few months, sir.

21:12.706 --> 21:15.796
- I was gonna ask you how
your first day went, but...

21:15.839 --> 21:17.928
- Captain Dipshit is not a fan.

21:18.712 --> 21:21.802
He rode my ass, acting like
I was incompetent.

21:21.845 --> 21:24.326
That was before I didn't secure
the door properly

21:24.370 --> 21:26.241
and we had to reject a takeoff.

21:26.285 --> 21:28.069
- At a controlled airport?

21:28.765 --> 21:30.724
- North House.
[sighs]

21:30.767 --> 21:32.769
Still warrants a report.

21:32.813 --> 21:34.597
Not a great look
on your Line Indoc.

21:35.206 --> 21:36.730
And I've already got two
strikes against me.

21:36.773 --> 21:38.340
I'm a woman and I'm Black.

21:38.384 --> 21:40.342
I have to work twice as hard
for half the credit.

21:41.430 --> 21:42.823
I can't make mistakes.

21:42.866 --> 21:44.781
- It happened at
an uncontrolled airport

21:44.825 --> 21:46.696
and everyone knows the door
on 911 is tricky.

21:46.740 --> 21:48.437
He should have
checked it himself.

21:48.481 --> 21:50.613
- He was too busy
screaming at me about
our clearance expiring.

21:50.657 --> 21:52.311
- His fault for
rushing you, then.

21:52.354 --> 21:54.704
When you rush,
real ugly shit happens.

21:54.748 --> 21:56.532
Bodie knows this.

21:57.664 --> 21:58.926
He'd be an asshole...

21:59.796 --> 22:02.886
a bigger asshole than usual
if he reported it.

22:09.023 --> 22:10.459
[dramatic music]

22:12.156 --> 22:13.854
Son of a bitch.

22:14.985 --> 22:16.247
[sighs]

22:19.990 --> 22:21.905
- That was cream
in the small coffee?

22:21.949 --> 22:22.819
- Milk.

22:26.432 --> 22:27.607
[retching]

22:34.614 --> 22:36.267
- Sorry. Uh...

22:36.964 --> 22:38.400
There's nothing wrong with this

22:38.444 --> 22:40.359
and I'm not contagious
or anything.

22:42.361 --> 22:43.579
[milk pouring]

22:45.320 --> 22:46.626
- How far along?

22:48.671 --> 22:49.759
- Uh...

22:51.021 --> 22:52.980
I'm going to the doctor today
to find out.

22:53.807 --> 22:54.721
You have kids?

22:55.374 --> 22:57.114
- No, I'm a nurse.

22:58.377 --> 23:00.596
Try ginger, it helps.

23:03.164 --> 23:04.774
I haven't even told anyone.

23:05.645 --> 23:07.081
I mean, just my jerk boyfriend,

23:07.124 --> 23:09.605
but he's not even returning
my calls right now, so...

23:11.041 --> 23:12.042
Sorry.

23:12.086 --> 23:13.566
Let me get your drinks.

23:13.609 --> 23:14.654
- Uh...

23:15.916 --> 23:17.178
If you need anything
or have any questions

23:17.221 --> 23:20.007
or want someone to talk to,

23:20.050 --> 23:21.269
I'm Hayley.

23:24.577 --> 23:26.361
- My boyfriend's
not really a jerk.

23:27.493 --> 23:28.755
We'll work it out.

23:37.459 --> 23:40.114
- I had time for a coffee run
before our schedevac.

23:41.507 --> 23:42.464
- I don't drink coffee.

23:42.508 --> 23:45.075
- Right. Green tea with honey?

23:46.555 --> 23:47.469
- Thanks.

23:50.254 --> 23:52.039
- Bring enough for the class,
nurse Roberts?

23:52.082 --> 23:54.563
- Triple espresso
with turpentine, right?

23:54.607 --> 23:56.304
- What's the matter, Bodie?

23:56.347 --> 23:58.437
Lexi didn't
kiss your ass enough

23:58.480 --> 24:02.005
or you just being a dick
'cause she's my friend?

24:02.049 --> 24:04.530
- You have friends, no-sack?
- Pretty pathetic.

24:04.573 --> 24:07.097
Setting up a greenhorn
just so you can report her.

24:07.141 --> 24:09.012
That the kind of bullshit you
talk about in your AC interview?

24:09.056 --> 24:12.102
- No, I told them about
hauling cargo around.

24:13.452 --> 24:14.670
Deadweight guys like you.

24:15.889 --> 24:18.021
- I'm not the one hauling
a PFO letter.

24:19.458 --> 24:20.850
- Wait, what's that mean?

24:20.894 --> 24:24.419
- Mister golden boy
didn't get the job.

24:24.463 --> 24:26.552
Tssk! He's full of shit.

24:26.595 --> 24:28.597
I called my buddy to see who's
in the next ground school.

24:28.641 --> 24:30.686
And it ain't you. Yeah.

24:30.730 --> 24:32.732
You want to act like
this big deal,

24:32.775 --> 24:34.298
stomping on everyone under you?

24:34.342 --> 24:35.996
But we both know...

24:36.039 --> 24:37.476
you're a joke.

24:38.868 --> 24:40.870
[sombre music]

24:45.658 --> 24:46.615
- Dude.

24:50.967 --> 24:52.621
[telephone rings]

24:55.929 --> 24:57.583
[dramatic music]

25:04.677 --> 25:05.939
[engine roars]

25:07.549 --> 25:09.595
- Get ready to brief.
- Affirmative.

25:11.553 --> 25:15.514
- We'll be doing KELTO-3 arrival
into Winnipeg, page 10-2 Bravo.

25:15.557 --> 25:17.559
Initial waypoint is VITAG.
- Copy.

25:18.821 --> 25:19.909
[sighs]

25:20.780 --> 25:23.478
Look, I get it,
you're pissed at me

25:23.522 --> 25:25.698
because I took a run
at the precious Austen Bodie,

25:25.741 --> 25:28.439
but if anyone had gone after him
the way he's been riding Lexi,

25:28.483 --> 25:30.224
you'd have done something too.

25:30.267 --> 25:31.747
[sombre music]

25:40.147 --> 25:42.845
- We have to be at KELTO
at 11,000 feet or below,

25:42.889 --> 25:44.412
250 knots.

25:47.633 --> 25:48.851
- I'm thirsty.

25:51.071 --> 25:52.202
- Alright.

25:52.246 --> 25:53.813
Let's see here.

25:56.685 --> 26:00.559
Okay, apple or orange?

26:01.255 --> 26:04.084
There was fruit punch,
but Chopper likes that one.

26:04.127 --> 26:05.520
- Apple?

26:09.959 --> 26:13.615
I don't need to go to Winnipeg.
I won't get another sore throat.

26:14.442 --> 26:15.356
[chuckles]

26:15.399 --> 26:17.140
- Look, I know it sounds scary,

26:17.184 --> 26:18.751
but you have nothing
to worry about.

26:18.794 --> 26:21.318
I mean, I got my tonsils
taken out and look.

26:22.842 --> 26:24.452
I hardly leak at all.

26:24.495 --> 26:25.584
[chuckles]

26:26.672 --> 26:27.890
[laughs]

26:32.808 --> 26:35.202
[indistinct radio chatter]

26:35.245 --> 26:38.292
You know, Lexi may be
your bestie,

26:38.335 --> 26:40.642
but we both know nobody
gets their panties twisted

26:40.686 --> 26:42.078
over the rules
more than you do.

26:42.122 --> 26:43.906
You'd have reported
that rejected takeoff too.

26:43.950 --> 26:45.604
- I wouldn't set a new pilot up,
though.

26:45.647 --> 26:47.170
- But that's not why
you called him out

26:47.214 --> 26:48.911
about not getting
the AC job, is it?

26:48.955 --> 26:50.826
You wanted to embarrass him.

26:51.653 --> 26:53.655
That's not about helping Lexi.

26:53.699 --> 26:54.787
That's about you.

26:54.830 --> 26:56.353
[indistinct radio chatter]

26:58.268 --> 26:59.835
- She has a lot of pain.

26:59.879 --> 27:01.968
She needs to see a doctor
at a hospital.

27:02.011 --> 27:03.883
- I'm not tying up a medevac
for indigestion.

27:03.926 --> 27:06.059
If you just take your stomach
pills, you'll be fine.

27:06.102 --> 27:08.888
- I told you, she's done that
and she's still in pain!

27:08.931 --> 27:10.890
She hurts so bad, she can't
get off the couch!

27:10.933 --> 27:12.239
- Forget it!
If you're here for drugs,

27:12.282 --> 27:13.936
you won't get any from me.

27:16.460 --> 27:17.461
- Hey, Camille.

27:18.637 --> 27:20.073
- How'd it go on Island Lake,
Gerald?

27:20.116 --> 27:22.989
- Gerald is a 65-year-old man
with type 2 diabetes,

27:23.032 --> 27:24.730
returning from regular dialysis.

27:25.818 --> 27:27.558
- We'll be on standby
when we get back to Thompson,

27:27.602 --> 27:30.518
but we need to restock
the abdo pads and check
our IV supply.

27:30.561 --> 27:31.693
- Okay.

27:32.259 --> 27:34.130
- My wife needs a hospital.

27:34.174 --> 27:35.741
And you're going to take her.

27:35.784 --> 27:37.046
[dramatic music]

27:42.965 --> 27:44.227
[suspenseful music]

27:44.271 --> 27:46.142
[panting]

27:46.186 --> 27:47.709
Start that plane.

27:47.753 --> 27:49.668
You're taking my wife
to a hospital.

27:51.017 --> 27:53.454
- Look, there's no need
for all of this.

27:53.497 --> 27:55.369
If you're sick, a nurse
from the nurse's station

27:55.412 --> 27:57.458
will book a medevac.
- No, she won't!

27:57.501 --> 27:59.199
No matter how many times
I take Sunny into there,

27:59.242 --> 28:01.723
that old bitch will not
put us on a plane.

28:01.767 --> 28:04.160
- She keeps saying
I have indigestion.

28:04.204 --> 28:06.815
And the pills don't do squat.

28:06.859 --> 28:09.775
My stomach, my back hurt
and I'm so weak.

28:09.818 --> 28:12.168
- I'm sure if you just explain--
- No! No one listens.

28:12.212 --> 28:13.517
I know my wife.

28:13.561 --> 28:15.041
There's something wrong.

28:15.084 --> 28:16.216
[panting]

28:16.259 --> 28:18.522
I'm not gonna
watch her suffer. You!

28:18.566 --> 28:20.350
You're gonna take us to a doctor

28:20.394 --> 28:22.439
and I'm gonna
make them help her.

28:22.875 --> 28:25.486
- We don't have enough fuel to
make it to the nearest hospital.

28:25.529 --> 28:26.748
[sighs]

28:27.401 --> 28:28.837
- You expect me to believe that?

28:28.881 --> 28:31.187
- We carry the minimum
to avoid weight restrictions.

28:31.231 --> 28:32.798
We're supposed to refuel
at the next community.

28:32.841 --> 28:34.669
- Sunny, right?

28:34.713 --> 28:36.366
And Keith?
- Yeah.

28:36.410 --> 28:38.629
- Hayley and I could have
a look at you right here.

28:38.673 --> 28:40.544
Maybe we could figure out
what's going on.

28:41.894 --> 28:42.895
- Keith.

28:42.938 --> 28:44.548
- Yeah?
[grunts]

28:44.592 --> 28:45.419
Okay.

28:45.724 --> 28:47.073
[grunts in pain]

28:54.384 --> 28:55.646
- Pulse is irregular.

28:55.690 --> 28:56.952
Are you a smoker?

28:56.996 --> 28:57.953
- No.

29:00.434 --> 29:01.565
[grunts]

29:03.176 --> 29:04.655
- Okay, I'm just gonna have
a listen to your chest, okay?

29:04.699 --> 29:05.874
- Okay.

29:05.918 --> 29:08.050
[panting]

29:08.094 --> 29:09.660
- Can you take a few deep
breaths for me?

29:09.704 --> 29:11.967
[deep breathing]

29:12.925 --> 29:13.752
Again.

29:17.364 --> 29:18.626
- Drink this.

29:18.669 --> 29:20.541
- Wait, wait, what is that
you're giving her?

29:20.584 --> 29:21.847
- Antacid and lidocaine.

29:21.890 --> 29:23.109
If the problem's in her stomach,

29:23.152 --> 29:24.893
we'll know in about 15 minutes.

29:26.895 --> 29:28.331
[tense music]

29:32.205 --> 29:33.684
- Where are you going there,
Keith?

29:35.338 --> 29:36.731
- Fuel caps...

29:44.086 --> 29:45.131
[grunts]

29:48.264 --> 29:49.439
- You're lying to me.

29:50.092 --> 29:51.702
Everybody keeps lying to us.

29:52.312 --> 29:53.487
We can't trust anybody.

29:53.530 --> 29:55.402
- Hey. We want to help you.

29:55.706 --> 29:58.274
Okay? But we can't
do things this way.

29:58.666 --> 30:00.015
I know you don't want
to hurt anyone.

30:00.059 --> 30:01.538
We don't want that either.

30:02.061 --> 30:04.324
We'll take you to Thompson,
no problem.

30:04.367 --> 30:05.716
Make sure your wife gets help.

30:08.110 --> 30:09.720
[♪]

30:12.027 --> 30:13.594
[grunts]
- Bodie!

30:13.637 --> 30:15.335
[panting]

30:15.378 --> 30:16.684
- It's fine, I'm okay.

30:16.727 --> 30:18.904
- It won't be, if you don't get
in that plane

30:18.947 --> 30:21.602
and take us to a hospital
right now!

30:21.645 --> 30:22.733
Go!

30:22.777 --> 30:24.126
[dramatic music]

30:24.170 --> 30:25.388
- Don't judge us.

30:25.736 --> 30:27.913
You don't know what
we've been dealing with.

30:27.956 --> 30:30.916
No one takes a Native woman
with pain seriously.

30:30.959 --> 30:35.050
They think I want drugs, but...
The drugs don't even help.

30:35.094 --> 30:36.878
[panting]

30:37.661 --> 30:38.706
Sometimes...

30:39.968 --> 30:42.884
It gets so bad that I can't
even stand up.

30:42.928 --> 30:46.888
I can't... I can't
get enough air.

30:46.932 --> 30:48.759
[dramatic music]

30:50.022 --> 30:52.851
We have a little girl
and I can't get sick

30:52.894 --> 30:54.330
and leave her alone.

30:54.374 --> 30:56.898
I lost my own mom
when I was young.

30:57.856 --> 30:59.422
- Wait, what did she die from?

31:00.206 --> 31:01.381
- I was small...

31:01.990 --> 31:03.949
I don't know, one day,
she was fine

31:03.992 --> 31:05.211
and the next, she was gone.

31:05.254 --> 31:07.778
And I can't do that to my Kimi.

31:11.304 --> 31:13.915
- Alright, come on,
let's get going.

31:13.959 --> 31:15.482
- Pink Lady should have
worked by now.

31:15.525 --> 31:16.918
It isn't stomach.

31:16.962 --> 31:18.789
Mom died young,
something genetic maybe?

31:18.833 --> 31:21.749
- Epigastric pain,
shortness of breath,

31:21.792 --> 31:23.446
irregular pulse...

31:23.882 --> 31:27.798
- Sats are low.
Too low for a young woman
who doesn't smoke.

31:27.842 --> 31:29.235
[regular beeping]

31:29.844 --> 31:32.064
[breathing heavily]

31:32.107 --> 31:34.631
- There, you hear that?

31:42.726 --> 31:44.903
I think your wife
has heart failure.

31:46.992 --> 31:48.080
- Is she gonna be okay?

31:48.123 --> 31:49.559
- If we get her
to a hospital quickly.

31:49.603 --> 31:51.039
Lasix, 40 milligrams.

31:51.083 --> 31:53.650
- Listen, Keith, I know you
haven't been treated well.

31:53.694 --> 31:55.826
But if you make this plane
takeoff at gunpoint,

31:55.870 --> 31:57.654
there's no coming back
from that.

31:57.698 --> 32:00.440
I give you my word, I'll take
Sunny to the hospital myself

32:00.483 --> 32:03.138
and I'll stay with her until
she gets the care she needs.

32:03.182 --> 32:04.139
Okay?

32:04.531 --> 32:05.445
Put the gun down.

32:10.754 --> 32:11.973

32:12.017 --> 32:13.192
What did you do to her?

32:13.235 --> 32:14.584
- Nothing, she isn't getting
enough oxygen,

32:14.628 --> 32:16.630
she needs a hospital.
[panting]

32:18.806 --> 32:21.809
- Take off now,
or so help me God,

32:21.852 --> 32:23.767
this time I will shoot him.

32:23.811 --> 32:24.986
[tense music]

32:29.686 --> 32:31.688
- Before, start checklist.

32:32.037 --> 32:33.299
- Park break.
- On.

32:33.342 --> 32:34.604
- Cabin door?

32:34.648 --> 32:36.650
[breathing shakily]

32:42.612 --> 32:43.744

32:43.787 --> 32:45.137

- Yeah, and I'm just the one

with actual medical training.
- Hey! I'm a hero.

33:26.787 --> 33:28.571
I thwarted a high-jacking.

33:28.615 --> 33:30.834
- I thought... I thought
Lexi was the hero.

33:30.878 --> 33:31.835
- Oh...

33:33.011 --> 33:34.403
Taught her everything she knows.
- Mm-hmm.

33:35.013 --> 33:36.014
[chuckling]

33:37.276 --> 33:39.321
Well, the bad news
is you're full of crap,

33:39.365 --> 33:40.931
but no concussion.

33:41.889 --> 33:43.325
Little glue should do it.

I guess it wasn't safe
to hook up with a co-worker
after all, huh?

33:51.203 --> 33:53.205
Since you're not leaving
Thompson just yet.

33:57.948 --> 33:59.863
- Is that a bad thing?

34:01.082 --> 34:02.649
- Hmm... More of a

34:02.692 --> 34:04.868
"How are we gonna work
together?" type of thing.

34:06.131 --> 34:08.176
- I think we work together
pretty good.

34:08.220 --> 34:09.830
[rhythmic music]

34:34.159 --> 34:37.597
- Sunny, you only need to see
a cardiologist in Winnipeg,

34:37.640 --> 34:41.122
but based on your ECG,
looks like Crystal was right.

34:41.166 --> 34:43.081
You have hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy.

34:43.124 --> 34:45.431
It's serious, but treatable.

34:45.953 --> 34:47.955
You'll need an implantable
cardiac defibrillator

34:47.998 --> 34:49.478
and beta blockers.

34:56.616 --> 34:58.313
Hey. You okay?

34:59.184 --> 35:01.664

so long to get to heart.

35:02.187 --> 35:04.145
All the signs were there--
- Hey, tough cookie.

35:04.189 --> 35:06.930
Your differential skills
under duress are impressive,

35:06.974 --> 35:09.194
but I mean more about how you
were just held at gunpoint.

35:10.369 --> 35:12.762
- I'm gonna make a statement
to the Northern Police.

35:13.894 --> 35:15.504
Keith isn't dangerous.

35:16.026 --> 35:19.247
Just desperate to save
the woman he loves.

35:52.498 --> 35:55.327

the manifests

35:55.370 --> 35:56.850
and botched a whole day's
worth of scheds,

35:56.893 --> 35:59.113
who helped you reroute
before anyone even knew?

35:59.157 --> 36:01.463
And Nuts, I took every single
one of your shifts

36:01.507 --> 36:03.248
when you had to go to Van
because you thought

36:03.291 --> 36:04.292
your girlfriend was cheating.

36:04.336 --> 36:05.772
You don't have to have my back

36:05.815 --> 36:07.077
because I got three
gold bars on it,

36:07.121 --> 36:09.645
but you damn well better
because I had yours.

36:22.615 --> 36:23.833
- Guess you don't need my help.

36:25.400 --> 36:26.619
- I got this.

36:26.967 --> 36:28.055
- Look.

36:29.578 --> 36:31.537
Yesterday, Pierce was asking
when I was leaving for AC,

36:31.580 --> 36:34.888
I... didn't tell him anything
about the rejected takeoff.

36:36.194 --> 36:39.371
[sighs]
Since it... was my fault.

36:39.849 --> 36:40.850
I'm sorry, Lex.

36:42.591 --> 36:44.332
Time for your real

found out about AC

38:22.691 --> 38:24.214
eventually, Scrotie.

38:24.954 --> 38:26.129
You might think I'm an asshole--

about you at all.

to the way things were.

39:45.383 --> 39:47.254
Before I found out about AC.

39:47.776 --> 39:48.908
And about...

...Madison.

39:55.349 --> 39:57.482
if I didn't tell you
when your fire light is on.

39:58.004 --> 40:00.398
You gotta take
the controls, Bodie.

40:06.491 --> 40:08.188
That's what almost killed Sunny.

- Sunny has indigestion.

40:09.972 --> 40:12.975
- No, Sunny had
concerning symptoms

40:13.019 --> 40:14.673
and you didn't listen to her.

You assumed
she was making it up.

40:19.591 --> 40:21.070
She could have died
because of it.

what I dealt with up here...

40:23.899 --> 40:26.511
- We all deal
with a lot up here.

40:26.554 --> 40:28.774
But we can't make assumptions
