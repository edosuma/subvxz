01:20.921 --> 01:22.514
<i>I raise my arms</i>

01:22.549 --> 01:23.850
<i>and I am like a scarecrow.</i>

01:26.255 --> 01:28.222
<i>1492.</i>

01:28.257 --> 01:29.887
<i>1492?</i>

01:29.923 --> 01:31.864
<i>Then when did Columbus</i>
<i>discover America?</i>

01:31.899 --> 01:33.131
<i>And the blankets,</i>

01:33.167 --> 01:34.867
<i>like the fields</i>
<i>burning at my feet.</i>

01:34.903 --> 01:37.864
<i>-1776.</i>
-<i> Wrong again!</i>

01:39.742 --> 01:41.098
<i>I do not scream.</i>

01:42.777 --> 01:44.035
<i>I do not feel heat.</i>

01:49.183 --> 01:52.384
<i>I'm not old enough</i>
<i>to know what to do.</i>

01:52.419 --> 01:55.321
<i>And so I stand there and</i>
<i>wonder what is happening.</i>

01:59.255 --> 02:00.793
<i>If I was hot before,</i>

02:00.828 --> 02:02.119
<i>I'm not any longer.</i>

02:06.331 --> 02:10.369
<i>Instead,</i>
<i>I am very, very cold.</i>

04:21.594 --> 04:22.666
Excuse me.

04:24.238 --> 04:25.639
It's worse than
I thought it'd be.

04:25.675 --> 04:27.037
Yeah, I know.

04:27.073 --> 04:28.708
Hey, another round.

04:33.508 --> 04:34.942
You girls need a drink?

04:35.784 --> 04:37.883
Uh... that's okay.

04:38.151 --> 04:40.413
Okay?
Do you want a drink?

04:40.449 --> 04:42.086
No. Thanks, though.

04:42.122 --> 04:43.951
Oh, you sure are welcome.

04:44.752 --> 04:46.859
-You girls are pretty.
-Thanks.

04:47.195 --> 04:49.825
-Can I buy you a drink?
-No, thanks.

04:50.865 --> 04:51.992
How about you?

04:53.296 --> 04:54.368
Do you wanna go?

04:55.102 --> 04:56.898
What? Is it something I did?

04:58.270 --> 05:00.105
I'm just trying to be nice.

05:00.141 --> 05:02.107
You were so nice.
Thank you.

05:02.142 --> 05:04.301
Guys can't be nice anymore?

05:05.280 --> 05:07.638
No, but we gotta
take it back to '05 view.

05:07.674 --> 05:10.173
'05. People want it.

05:10.208 --> 05:13.644
-They want it.
-Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, oh, oh!

05:13.680 --> 05:15.614
-Yes!

05:15.649 --> 05:17.782
-What!

05:17.817 --> 05:20.485
And walk, and walk, and pose.

05:20.521 --> 05:22.220
Shine, shine.

05:25.399 --> 05:27.967
Keeping 'em straight.
Keep them straight.

05:28.002 --> 05:30.164
-We should go.
-I know.

05:30.199 --> 05:31.262
I know.

05:32.136 --> 05:33.198
I got you.

05:33.632 --> 05:34.738
Hey!

05:36.373 --> 05:37.906
Go back to your country!

05:41.177 --> 05:42.240
Hey!

05:43.542 --> 05:44.616
Hey!

05:51.355 --> 05:53.026
This is my country!

05:53.061 --> 05:55.286
Go back to yours, you fucker!

06:48.478 --> 06:50.508
Well, look who it is.

06:50.543 --> 06:51.617
Hey you.

06:52.648 --> 06:55.047
-Are you off soon?
-I am.

06:55.082 --> 06:56.946
It's just gonna be
a couple more minutes.

06:56.982 --> 06:59.191
Wanna go for a ride?

06:59.226 --> 07:01.690
-On the house.
-Thank you.

07:01.725 --> 07:03.027
Is that your roommate
over there?

07:03.063 --> 07:04.124
Yeah.

07:06.462 --> 07:08.092
-Hey.
-Hey.

07:08.127 --> 07:09.932
I was at your house
the other night.

07:10.267 --> 07:11.329
I remember.

07:12.174 --> 07:14.101
-What's your name again?
-Tiger.

07:14.801 --> 07:16.874
-And you are?
-Rae.

07:16.910 --> 07:18.136
Rae.

07:18.171 --> 07:20.211
What's that, some kind
of nickname, Tiger?

07:20.246 --> 07:22.712
Yeah. What about you?

07:22.748 --> 07:24.775
You're Rae 'cause you're
such a ray of sunshine?

07:24.811 --> 07:26.718
-R-A-E.

07:28.585 --> 07:30.557
-Do you mind if I sit?
-No.

07:40.663 --> 07:42.063
What brings you to Billings?

07:42.963 --> 07:45.237
-Various things.
-Ah...

07:45.373 --> 07:48.333
-What about you?
-Oh, I'm from here.

07:48.869 --> 07:51.176
-So is Chrissy B.
-Yeah.

07:51.212 --> 07:53.580
Well, pretty close anyway.

07:55.313 --> 07:56.413
What do you mean?

07:56.448 --> 07:58.750
Oh, she's from the rez, right?

07:59.779 --> 08:01.214
Oh, yeah, I guess.

08:03.389 --> 08:04.850
-Done for the day?
-Mm-hm.

08:04.886 --> 08:06.859
-Cool, you ready to go?
-Yeah.

08:06.895 --> 08:08.424
All right.

08:08.459 --> 08:09.757
What are you guys up to?

08:09.793 --> 08:11.831
We're going for a ride.

08:11.867 --> 08:13.028
Oh, cool.

08:14.961 --> 08:16.326
I didn't realize you had plans.

08:16.361 --> 08:19.164
Yeah, it just, uh--
just kind of happened.

08:19.199 --> 08:21.169
I was hoping we could
hang out tonight.

08:21.204 --> 08:24.168
Mm. Oh, we can hang out later.
I won't even be gone long.

08:24.203 --> 08:25.508
Did anybody order
this cappuccino?

08:25.543 --> 08:27.372
-Oh, my God.

08:28.182 --> 08:29.475
I'm not even like that.

08:32.719 --> 08:34.412
Sorry, I'll--
I'll see you later, all right?

08:37.390 --> 08:38.883
-Bye.
-Bye, Rae.

08:38.918 --> 08:40.286
-Bye.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.691
-Have you ridden before?
-No.

08:48.494 --> 08:50.864
You're gonna put your feet on
these back pedals.

08:50.900 --> 08:53.574
-Hold onto me tight.
-All right.

08:56.343 --> 08:58.612
I'm so excited.

09:06.915 --> 09:09.051
-We're closing.
-Yeah.

10:31.473 --> 10:33.264
-It's where you eat--

10:33.299 --> 10:34.833
-It's where you eat the tongue.
-No.

10:34.869 --> 10:36.072
It's edible.

10:36.674 --> 10:37.844
-It's true.
-No.

10:38.113 --> 10:39.310
It is.

10:39.345 --> 10:41.079
-No.

10:41.115 --> 10:42.683
Hey.

10:46.154 --> 10:47.215
Do I know you?

10:48.721 --> 10:50.548
Yeah, I used to date
your brother.

10:52.192 --> 10:54.519
Oh... right.

10:57.132 --> 10:58.358
What's going on?

11:04.238 --> 11:05.332
You should go in.

11:10.308 --> 11:11.371
Go on.

11:17.142 --> 11:19.753
-Whoo!

11:36.598 --> 11:37.804
Welcome.

11:43.875 --> 11:45.603
-This your place?
-Mm-hm.

11:53.586 --> 11:55.250
You know something, don't you?

12:01.024 --> 12:02.763
I don't know what you're
talking about.

12:12.571 --> 12:14.005
For the long road ahead.

12:30.819 --> 12:35.125
Ooooh... Whoa!

12:36.097 --> 12:37.589
Ooh!

13:51.464 --> 13:53.500
Did you see any flyers
on other doors?

13:54.638 --> 13:55.700
Didn't look.

13:56.476 --> 13:57.603
Maybe you should.

13:59.912 --> 14:01.882
You think they're
targeting me?

14:03.074 --> 14:04.181
Maybe.

14:06.845 --> 14:09.087
Thought this kind of thing
didn't happen anymore.

14:12.353 --> 14:14.455
None of this
has ever gone away.

14:54.231 --> 14:56.662
-Thanks, purple people.
-You betcha.

15:28.430 --> 15:30.168
Do you ever feel like
something's missing?

15:35.010 --> 15:37.703
If I've been away from
my family too long, yeah.

15:39.313 --> 15:40.376
Do you?

15:42.745 --> 15:43.808
Yeah.

15:44.782 --> 15:45.843
All the time.

15:51.285 --> 15:53.191
It's like a dark, dark hole.

15:57.797 --> 15:59.197
What if we moved somewhere?

16:00.325 --> 16:01.397
What do you mean?

16:02.604 --> 16:04.367
Like to a different city?

16:05.805 --> 16:07.370
Aren't you tired of this place?

16:09.544 --> 16:11.011
My ancestors are here.

16:12.638 --> 16:14.806
Yeah. Doesn't mean
you can't leave.

16:24.024 --> 16:26.120
The government wanted us
out of these hills

16:26.155 --> 16:27.588
so they could take the land.

16:30.632 --> 16:32.029
They wanted us to go south

16:32.064 --> 16:34.694
to lump us with
the southern Cheyenne.

16:36.704 --> 16:38.203
But the south made us sick.

16:41.135 --> 16:42.702
They shot us down.

16:43.412 --> 16:46.002
But we ran home.

18:14.964 --> 18:16.026
Whatever.

Johnny.

-All right, I'm gonna
set you up later.
-Yeah.

-Hi.

20:25.793 --> 20:27.492
Oh, my God,
that took me forever.

20:27.527 --> 20:28.560
I got caught dancing.

20:28.596 --> 20:30.693
That's funny.

20:30.728 --> 20:32.404
Hi. Do you know Johnny?

20:52.586 --> 20:54.693
Hey.
Hey, sorry we're late.

20:54.728 --> 20:55.790
I gotta go.

20:57.128 --> 20:59.763
Rae. What's going on?

20:59.798 --> 21:01.357
Nothing!

21:01.393 --> 21:02.467
Rae.

21:03.131 --> 21:04.732
Rae!

21:04.768 --> 21:07.098
You guys are so cute together.
Have so much fun.

21:10.141 --> 21:11.267
Where are you going?

21:16.318 --> 21:18.579
-Now asking
forgiveness for our sins.

21:18.614 --> 21:20.581
Let's pray as our savior
has taught us.

21:20.616 --> 21:23.147
Our Father,
who art in heaven,

21:24.254 --> 21:25.989
hallowed be thy name.

21:26.024 --> 21:27.727
Thy kingdom come,

21:27.762 --> 21:29.159
Thy will be done,

21:29.194 --> 21:31.821
on earth as it is in heaven.

21:31.857 --> 21:34.427
Give us this day
our daily bread.

21:34.462 --> 21:36.564
And forgive us our sins,

21:36.599 --> 21:39.730
as we forgive those who
sin against us.

21:39.765 --> 21:41.940
Lead us not into temptation,

21:41.976 --> 21:44.177
but deliver us from evil,

21:44.212 --> 21:47.243
for thine is the kingdom,
and the power,

21:47.279 --> 21:49.811
and the glory, forever.
Amen.

22:36.492 --> 22:37.925
Can I show you something?

22:42.198 --> 22:43.293
What is it?

22:44.170 --> 22:45.735
Just a place I like to go.

22:49.008 --> 22:50.234
What about them?

22:51.110 --> 22:52.302
They'll be all right.

22:53.410 --> 22:54.876
We'll be back in a minute.

22:59.280 --> 23:00.376
Okay.

23:13.295 --> 23:14.830
Exxon.

23:20.271 --> 23:21.736
I like to come out here

23:21.771 --> 23:23.971
and remind myself
what it is I'm doing.

23:26.772 --> 23:27.843
What are you doing?

23:32.151 --> 23:33.343
Setting people free.

23:52.773 --> 23:53.836
Another.

24:00.975 --> 24:03.208
So you're
having them young now.

24:04.646 --> 24:06.178
Mind your business, Elaine.

24:07.519 --> 24:09.284
Can't get someone
your own age?

24:09.320 --> 24:10.380
It's not like that.

24:13.520 --> 24:14.626
You sure?

24:20.691 --> 24:21.864
Damn it.

24:22.497 --> 24:23.536
Who's your friend?

24:25.204 --> 24:27.006
She was very pretty.

24:27.041 --> 24:29.069
-Let's go.
-Not yet.

24:31.772 --> 24:33.645
She's my wife. My ex wife.

24:34.881 --> 24:35.977
Oh.

24:38.550 --> 24:39.845
Is that why you're
living in a motel?

24:39.881 --> 24:41.818
That's not your
goddamn business.

24:43.648 --> 24:44.722
Sorry.

24:45.289 --> 24:47.827
She left me, so...

24:47.862 --> 24:48.924
I left them.

24:50.226 --> 24:51.322
Them?

24:54.694 --> 24:55.766
Hey, hey, wait.

24:56.795 --> 24:58.798
Hey, come on.

24:58.834 --> 25:00.397
She doesn't get to
ruin your night.

25:01.205 --> 25:02.432
Let's dance.

25:04.537 --> 25:05.611
Come on.

25:06.376 --> 25:07.580
Don't be a doozy.

25:09.740 --> 25:10.847
Come on.

25:14.219 --> 25:15.621
Oh, it's so hard.

26:01.268 --> 26:03.593
-It's time to go to bed.
-No!

26:03.862 --> 26:05.462
Yes, you have to.

26:06.634 --> 26:08.135
Come on, come on.

26:16.613 --> 26:18.277
Okay, good night.

26:51.314 --> 26:52.377
Fuck.

27:01.957 --> 27:03.796
What the fuck are
you doing here?

27:04.432 --> 27:06.127
Good morning to you too.

27:07.600 --> 27:08.797
I was just wondering
if I could get

27:08.832 --> 27:10.527
that book back that
I loaned you.

27:11.138 --> 27:12.137
What book?

27:12.172 --> 27:13.398
It's a Rilke book.

27:27.681 --> 27:29.018
Hi, Johnny.

27:30.157 --> 27:31.317
Hi, Chrissy B.

27:32.218 --> 27:35.088
Are you, uh...
liking the house?

27:35.123 --> 27:37.730
Yeah, it's been great.
Thanks for leaving.

27:38.989 --> 27:40.062
Sure thing.

27:46.204 --> 27:47.267
Thanks.

27:48.009 --> 27:49.967
Hey, um...

27:50.003 --> 27:51.370
I wanted to say I'm sorry.

27:53.311 --> 27:54.373
What about?

27:55.711 --> 27:56.844
I didn't mean for you

27:56.880 --> 27:58.679
to find out about Kelly
that way.

27:58.714 --> 28:00.384
Kelly. It's a cool name.

28:00.419 --> 28:01.946
-Rae.
-What?

28:02.382 --> 28:04.454
How would you have
preferred me to meet her?

28:04.489 --> 28:05.857
I'm trying to be nice.

28:06.424 --> 28:08.519
Oh, I didn't know.

28:09.990 --> 28:11.962
-I should get going.
-Yeah.

28:14.698 --> 28:16.901
Hey, is that--
Is that me?

28:18.005 --> 28:19.070
Yeah.

28:19.706 --> 28:22.907
My eyes look kinda Jewish-y.
Don't you think?

28:25.243 --> 28:26.409
What?

28:26.611 --> 28:28.074
You know, like when your eyes

28:28.110 --> 28:29.782
get those big dark circles
under them?

28:30.582 --> 28:31.883
I look kind of like that.

28:33.119 --> 28:34.480
Oh...

28:34.916 --> 28:36.415
Come on, it's a joke, Rae.

28:37.525 --> 28:39.759
-Okay.
-You're supposed to laugh.

28:43.528 --> 28:44.720
All right, tough crowd.

28:47.364 --> 28:48.427
See 'ya.

29:23.500 --> 29:24.595
You okay?

29:25.600 --> 29:26.630
Yeah.

29:27.264 --> 29:28.434
Why would you say that?

29:30.277 --> 29:31.338
Just checking.

29:33.004 --> 29:34.110
I'm fine.

29:50.622 --> 29:52.754
-I thought they'd left.
-Me too.

29:52.790 --> 29:54.628
In the '90s they wanted
Billings to be their home.

29:55.031 --> 29:56.267
Is that what was going on?

29:56.303 --> 29:57.367
Yeah.

29:58.003 --> 30:00.004
-Any arrests yet?
-Not yet.

30:01.942 --> 30:03.876
Things can get
pretty ugly with these guys.

31:03.929 --> 31:06.400
<i>I remember the first time</i>
<i>Johnny and I held hands.</i>

31:13.175 --> 31:14.870
<i>My hand felt like</i>
<i>it was burning.</i>

31:27.595 --> 31:29.962
<i>Like it was feeling too much.</i>

31:36.394 --> 31:37.893
<i>The emptiness is endless.</i>

32:16.103 --> 32:17.372
I love you, Rae.

32:22.679 --> 32:23.873
I love you.

32:25.682 --> 32:26.876
I love you.

32:29.587 --> 32:30.649
I love you.

32:51.545 --> 32:52.704
Are you afraid of me?

33:12.995 --> 33:14.693
Are you afraid of me?

33:47.759 --> 33:50.399
<i>Everything is bigger</i>
<i>and blurrier.</i>

33:51.663 --> 33:53.105
<i>And that is</i>
<i>the way I love it.</i>

33:55.102 --> 33:56.267
<i>I am burning.</i>

33:56.369 --> 33:57.707
-Rae!

33:57.742 --> 33:58.838
<i>I am on fire.</i>

33:58.874 --> 34:00.569
Rae!

34:00.605 --> 34:01.878
<i>-I'm finally...</i>
-Rae!

34:01.913 --> 34:03.973
<i>...and indefinitely free.</i>

34:46.560 --> 34:47.687
How are you doing?

34:50.929 --> 34:53.363
-Is my Mom here?
-Your mom?

34:55.463 --> 34:57.202
Would you like for me
to call her?

34:59.336 --> 35:01.338
Would you like for me
to call somebody?

35:05.177 --> 35:09.104
Is, uh-- Is there
an older man around?

35:10.651 --> 35:12.217
Like a man in his 40s?

35:15.953 --> 35:17.613
Just rest for a while.

35:17.648 --> 35:19.290
You had a lot in your system.

35:20.660 --> 35:21.917
When you're ready,

35:21.952 --> 35:23.657
maybe you'd like to
consider some treatment.

35:28.434 --> 35:31.494
We have-- We have some brochures
on some addiction facilities

35:31.529 --> 35:33.029
that would welcome you.

35:34.631 --> 35:36.000
You think I'm an addict?

35:36.469 --> 35:38.808
I'm not making a judgment.

35:39.277 --> 35:41.642
You had a lot of OxyContin
in your system,

35:43.181 --> 35:45.877
and it's a very addictive
substance.

35:47.518 --> 35:50.585
We're here to help you in
any way that we can help.

35:53.350 --> 35:54.557
Okay.

36:12.875 --> 36:13.938
Hey.

36:15.240 --> 36:16.347
Hey.

36:18.751 --> 36:19.944
Are you okay?

36:25.352 --> 36:26.555
Rae, what's going on?

36:30.763 --> 36:31.791
I need to go home.

36:32.857 --> 36:36.092
Yeah. Yeah,
of course you should.

36:40.664 --> 36:42.197
I'm bad news, Chrissy.

36:43.338 --> 36:45.200
What are you talking about?

36:49.773 --> 36:51.316
I don't know what I'm doing.

36:54.118 --> 36:56.255
I don't know what's going on.

36:57.524 --> 36:58.587
Hey.

37:00.956 --> 37:02.052
Hey.

37:04.094 --> 37:05.429
You're gonna be okay.

38:59.473 --> 39:00.907
Oh, my God.

39:23.761 --> 39:25.001
You're so beautiful.

39:25.037 --> 39:26.735
-Mom.
-You are.

39:27.705 --> 39:30.299
You've become even more
beautiful since you left.

39:31.735 --> 39:32.807
I doubt that.

39:36.179 --> 39:37.314
Maybe tomorrow

39:37.349 --> 39:39.044
you could come with me
to my art show?

39:40.119 --> 39:41.382
You're having an art show?

39:41.417 --> 39:43.422
Yeah, it's just a little thing.

39:44.517 --> 39:45.886
That's great, Mom.

39:50.854 --> 39:52.156
I'm so glad you're home.

39:57.798 --> 40:00.670
-Are you home for good
or just a visit?

40:04.108 --> 40:05.235
I don't know.

40:14.783 --> 40:16.518
I'm really sorry
about the mess.

40:16.553 --> 40:18.919
I had to clear out my closet
for Jim.

40:21.656 --> 40:23.825
-Jim?
-My boyfriend.

40:25.758 --> 40:28.500
He lives here. Sometimes.

40:29.428 --> 40:31.036
Oh...

40:31.071 --> 40:32.537
I thought I mentioned that.

40:36.075 --> 40:38.035
Maybe you could just...

40:38.070 --> 40:40.006
move some of these things
out of the way.

40:42.344 --> 40:43.713
It's okay, right?

40:44.148 --> 40:45.440
Yeah, it's fine.

40:46.414 --> 40:47.942
He's really nice.

40:48.345 --> 40:50.379
I hope you and Jim can
get to know each other.

40:51.186 --> 40:52.253
Yeah.

40:52.288 --> 40:53.558
I'm happy for you.

41:03.862 --> 41:05.537
I love you more than anything.

41:07.006 --> 41:08.067
Love you too.

41:24.216 --> 41:26.254
You know,
it was really devastating,

41:26.290 --> 41:28.426
and it impacted me,

41:28.461 --> 41:30.361
and I just felt like
it was really important

41:30.396 --> 41:32.322
to bring awareness
to what happened.

41:34.334 --> 41:35.858
Thanks so much for coming,
you guys.

41:35.893 --> 41:37.228
I really appreciate it.

41:38.865 --> 41:40.001
-Hey.
-Oh, excuse me.

41:40.037 --> 41:41.100
Hey.

41:42.335 --> 41:44.800
-I'm so glad you made it.
-Everything going okay?

41:44.835 --> 41:46.470
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

41:46.506 --> 41:48.272
Yeah. Rae.

41:51.976 --> 41:54.283
Jim, this is my daughter, Rae.

41:54.318 --> 41:56.781
-Hi there, Rae.
-Hi.

41:56.816 --> 41:58.351
So nice to finally meet you.

41:58.920 --> 42:00.724
It's nice--
It's nice to meet you, too.

42:02.659 --> 42:04.893
Your mom talks about you
all the time.

42:06.230 --> 42:07.291
She misses you.

43:23.907 --> 43:26.371
Have you ever read
any of the Bible?

43:26.407 --> 43:29.378
Or like-- I would be very happy
to read some passages to you.

43:29.413 --> 43:30.682
Some of my favorites.

43:31.652 --> 43:33.784
Have you guys been walking
this whole neighborhood?

43:34.186 --> 43:35.945
Yes, yes we have.

43:36.347 --> 43:38.146
It really breaks down how
the Bible can be

43:38.181 --> 43:41.220
-so helpful to us--
-Mm-hm.

43:41.255 --> 43:45.059
On all of the questions
that we might have in our lives.

43:45.592 --> 43:46.665
That's okay.

43:50.129 --> 43:52.297
How about you?
Have you read the Bible?

43:52.798 --> 43:53.938
I've heard of it.

43:57.972 --> 44:02.004
Well, the Bible can be
so helpful to us

44:02.039 --> 44:03.374
in our day to day lives.

44:04.381 --> 44:05.508
We're Jewish.

44:06.383 --> 44:07.510
Oh...

44:08.179 --> 44:09.513
Did my mom said that?

44:10.315 --> 44:13.054
No, no she didn't--
she didn't mention it.

44:16.056 --> 44:17.887
It's so interesting
to meet you.

44:18.523 --> 44:21.656
Do you-- Do you find that
there are many Jews here?

44:22.661 --> 44:23.735
No.

44:24.071 --> 44:25.167
I see.

44:25.803 --> 44:28.839
Well, it is so interesting
to meet you.

44:30.301 --> 44:32.601
Where can I leave
some pamphlets?

44:53.359 --> 44:55.893
Hey, uh, do you think
we could do something

44:55.928 --> 44:57.563
just mean you tonight?

44:57.599 --> 44:59.562
Sure. Like what?

45:03.332 --> 45:05.073
What are you fine ladies up to?

45:09.340 --> 45:10.873
We're just having some pizza.

45:10.909 --> 45:11.981
Come join us.

45:13.182 --> 45:15.150
Oh, that's cool.
I never noticed that before.

45:15.419 --> 45:17.088
It's a Hamsa.

45:17.123 --> 45:18.414
A what's-a?

45:18.450 --> 45:21.919
It's a symbol to help
ward off evil spirits.

45:21.955 --> 45:23.518
-Protection.
-Mm.

45:23.553 --> 45:25.230
It's supposed to be
the hand of God.

45:25.265 --> 45:26.798
Oh, that's rad.

45:31.764 --> 45:32.837
Cool.

45:39.037 --> 45:40.609
Mind if I join, my lady?

45:40.645 --> 45:42.308
Of course, have a seat.

45:46.913 --> 45:50.151
Nice.

45:54.459 --> 45:57.252
-Mm.
-Slow down.

45:57.287 --> 45:59.086
-Hm?
-Don't wanna choke.

45:59.122 --> 46:00.531
Oh, it's fine.

46:00.566 --> 46:02.361
I got a big throat.

46:37.765 --> 46:39.365
What you drinking?

46:40.605 --> 46:42.467
-Whiskey.
-Oh...

46:43.639 --> 46:44.700
Two more whiskies.

47:44.702 --> 47:46.762
-What's the 88 for?
-What?

47:47.902 --> 47:50.106
The 88, what's it for?

47:50.903 --> 47:53.043
H, H, baby!

47:54.612 --> 47:58.075
Like Handsome, handsome?

47:58.110 --> 47:59.544
What, you don't know?

48:00.253 --> 48:01.986
Heil Hitler.

48:03.555 --> 48:05.583
Yeah, right.

48:06.889 --> 48:08.586
What's so funny about that?

48:13.092 --> 48:14.559
You know I'm Jewish.

48:27.439 --> 48:29.442
Don't tell anyone
about this, okay?

48:34.150 --> 48:36.279
-Say you won't tell anyone!
-Leave me alone.

48:36.315 --> 48:38.253
-Say it, okay?
-Get off of me!

49:01.577 --> 49:02.673
Come in.

49:06.518 --> 49:07.612
Wanna go out?

49:08.848 --> 49:09.944
Now?

49:14.788 --> 49:15.851
Sure.

49:16.460 --> 49:17.523
Yes!

49:28.638 --> 49:29.898
Hey, Cinz.

49:34.837 --> 49:37.015
-And what
would you like?
-The same.

49:45.018 --> 49:46.090
Hit it again.

50:02.475 --> 50:04.108
I love this song.

50:09.348 --> 50:10.412
Come on.

50:10.881 --> 50:13.045
Come on, don't be a doozy.

50:13.080 --> 50:15.911
Oh, my goodness.
Wow.

50:36.866 --> 50:38.672
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

50:49.920 --> 50:51.982
-Uh-oh.
-Oh, what?

51:18.982 --> 51:21.977
<i>♪ ...cheap motel room</i> ♪

51:26.222 --> 51:29.351
Oh, my God!
How the heck are you?

51:29.720 --> 51:31.925
Hanging in there.
Hanging in there.

51:31.961 --> 51:33.125
Having a good night?

51:33.160 --> 51:35.633
Yes, with my daughter.

51:35.668 --> 51:39.232
This is Rae!

51:39.268 --> 51:41.234
Oh, my God,
I can't believe it.

51:41.270 --> 51:43.935
-You look like sisters.
-Oh, stop.

51:46.108 --> 51:47.343
Don't you remember Lacey?

51:48.847 --> 51:50.478
You and my son used to play.

51:52.143 --> 51:53.209
Oh...

51:53.245 --> 51:54.546
Oh, and gosh,

51:54.582 --> 51:57.155
that one night we left
you guys by yourself.

51:58.650 --> 52:01.087
Best parenting decision,
right, Mags?

52:01.122 --> 52:02.655
Oh, my God!

52:04.124 --> 52:05.425
-Hey.
-Hey.

52:05.460 --> 52:07.093
Oh, thank you so much
for coming.

52:07.128 --> 52:09.123
Oh, no problem.

52:09.158 --> 52:10.894
<i>I don't know why we</i>
<i>didn't think of this before.</i>

52:12.037 --> 52:13.102
<i>Why are you here?</i>

52:13.137 --> 52:14.632
<i> Oh, honey,</i>
<i>you and Handsome</i>

52:14.667 --> 52:16.235

52:16.270 --> 52:17.472
<i>Doesn't that sound like fun?</i>

52:18.777 --> 52:20.002
I'll be right back.

52:36.059 --> 52:37.424
Get back?

52:37.460 --> 52:38.986
Mommy's gonna go hang out
with her friends,

52:39.021 --> 52:40.798
and you get to hang out
with your friend.

52:40.833 --> 52:42.266
Doesn't that sound like fun?

52:44.001 --> 52:45.500
I love you more than anything.

54:06.478 --> 54:07.978
Here. I got you another.

54:09.986 --> 54:11.179
Did you leave me?

54:14.588 --> 54:16.558
I always thought
I was just a stupid kid

54:16.593 --> 54:19.322
who did a stupid thing
and I've hated myself for it.

54:20.058 --> 54:22.828
But you left me by myself.
What was I supposed to do?

54:23.902 --> 54:24.995
How could you do that?

54:28.499 --> 54:29.868
How could you?

54:30.576 --> 54:31.639
Rae!

54:46.923 --> 54:49.019
Rae. Stop!

55:22.657 --> 55:24.758
You know this is where
you were conceived?

55:30.130 --> 55:31.193
What?

55:32.566 --> 55:35.934
You were conceived here.

55:40.477 --> 55:42.776
Were you and my dad
on a date or something?

56:05.861 --> 56:08.098
I wanted to have you.

56:10.669 --> 56:13.411
I was really happy to have you.

56:16.245 --> 56:18.482
But I was so young...

56:19.876 --> 56:21.276
and I wasn't ready at all.

56:23.119 --> 56:24.312
My mom was gone.

56:28.928 --> 56:30.791
I was just really alone.

56:47.939 --> 56:49.942
That shouldn't have
happened to you.

56:54.914 --> 56:57.081
I have always wanted
the best for you.

57:03.722 --> 57:05.925
You deserve so much better.

58:52.998 --> 58:55.131
Would you like to
keep this photo?

58:55.166 --> 58:57.071
I noticed you had it
out on your dresser.

58:57.106 --> 58:58.202
Oh...

59:24.896 --> 59:26.329
You're like her, you know.

59:30.799 --> 59:31.906
I am?

59:33.802 --> 59:34.909
Yeah.

59:37.039 --> 59:39.177
You're strong, like her.

59:44.489 --> 59:46.151
That's why I named you
after her.

1:01:35.930 --> 1:01:37.166
Do you think you
could add this photo

1:01:37.202 --> 1:01:38.200
to the memorial?

1:01:38.236 --> 1:01:39.297
Oh, sure, dear.

1:01:41.438 --> 1:01:42.971
Oh, she's beautiful.

1:01:43.340 --> 1:01:44.368
Are you family?

1:01:45.077 --> 1:01:46.139
Yeah.

1:01:48.413 --> 1:01:49.879
She's survived the Holocaust.

1:01:51.446 --> 1:01:52.783
Oh, really?

1:01:55.750 --> 1:01:58.316
Well, you have survivor blood.

1:01:59.522 --> 1:02:00.956
I don't know about that.

1:02:01.458 --> 1:02:03.420
No, you do.

1:02:05.461 --> 1:02:06.489
I can see it.

1:02:09.698 --> 1:02:11.395
Do you want to take the tour?

1:02:12.901 --> 1:02:15.369
Uh, no, I'm-- I'm good.
Thank you.

1:02:15.404 --> 1:02:16.739
Oh, come on.

1:02:16.774 --> 1:02:18.941
I'm leading the next shift.
It'll be fun.

1:02:21.477 --> 1:02:23.308
-Okay.
-Great.

1:02:27.485 --> 1:02:28.918
On our way up here,

1:02:28.953 --> 1:02:31.087
I think I'll give you
a little bit of information.

1:02:31.623 --> 1:02:35.288
Our Lady of the Rockies
sits 90 feet

1:02:35.323 --> 1:02:40.989
atop the Continental Divide
at an elevation of 8,510 feet.

1:02:41.625 --> 1:02:47.035
Plans to build the statue
began in December of 1979.

1:02:48.004 --> 1:02:52.304
People of all walks of life
and every religion

1:02:53.437 --> 1:02:56.636
paved the way for
the statue to be built

1:02:56.671 --> 1:03:00.446
in the likeness of Mary,
the mother of Jesus.

1:03:01.315 --> 1:03:05.146
Our Lady of the Rockies
is entirely nondenominational.

1:03:05.482 --> 1:03:07.786
Dedicated by workers
to women everywhere,

1:03:07.821 --> 1:03:09.123
especially to mothers.

1:03:10.792 --> 1:03:13.894
Thank you so much for joining us

1:03:13.929 --> 1:03:16.565
on our way up to
Our Lady of the Rockies.

1:03:16.600 --> 1:03:18.066
We hope you enjoy your visit.

1:03:43.988 --> 1:03:45.192
That's my husband.

1:04:17.059 --> 1:04:21.096
One of America's
top super fun sites,

1:04:21.829 --> 1:04:23.131
from the mining days.

1:04:25.403 --> 1:04:26.563
Such a tragedy.

1:07:40.532 --> 1:07:41.791
Wolf, open up.

1:07:43.030 --> 1:07:44.059
I know you're in there.

1:07:48.236 --> 1:07:49.601
That's enough, that's enough.

1:07:51.272 --> 1:07:53.170
Why are you running
away from me?

1:07:53.205 --> 1:07:54.834
I'm not running.

1:07:54.869 --> 1:07:56.839
Why did you ignore me
when I saw you?

1:07:58.374 --> 1:07:59.446
I didn't see you.

1:08:01.786 --> 1:08:03.549
You left me by myself, asshole.

1:08:03.584 --> 1:08:06.516
Hey, hey, hey.
I brought you to the hospital.

1:08:06.552 --> 1:08:08.455
They were supposed
to take care of you.

1:08:12.324 --> 1:08:13.790
Why didn't you stay with me?

1:08:16.066 --> 1:08:17.761
I didn't think
you would want me to.

1:08:18.802 --> 1:08:20.027
Well, I wanted you to.

1:08:28.675 --> 1:08:30.840
You know, you think you're
helping but you're not.

1:08:31.440 --> 1:08:32.512
You're enabling.

1:08:33.842 --> 1:08:35.878
So we can all
free-fall like you.

1:08:36.787 --> 1:08:38.144
Is that what you want?

1:08:38.580 --> 1:08:40.388
Just not be so alone.

1:08:40.822 --> 1:08:41.884
Is that it?

1:08:47.325 --> 1:08:48.860
Don't give me this shit.

1:08:49.262 --> 1:08:50.827
Well, it's not fair.

1:08:50.862 --> 1:08:53.797
Rae, you don't know what
the fuck you're talking about.

1:08:56.103 --> 1:08:58.632
Yeah, you're right.

1:08:58.668 --> 1:08:59.970
Don't give me this shit.

1:09:00.006 --> 1:09:01.068
Fuck you.

1:09:02.505 --> 1:09:04.137
Don't give me this shit!

Thanks.

1:09:37.639 --> 1:09:39.214
Congratulations.

1:09:39.249 --> 1:09:41.546
-Yeah,
these are truly beautiful.

1:09:41.581 --> 1:09:43.215
We're gonna
look around some more.

1:09:43.250 --> 1:09:45.387
Yeah, no.
Enjoy yourself.

1:09:48.593 --> 1:09:51.019
Oh, my God.

1:09:52.356 --> 1:09:53.428
This is amazing.

1:09:55.261 --> 1:09:57.357
I'm so proud of you.

1:09:57.393 --> 1:09:58.496
Thank you.

1:09:58.531 --> 1:10:00.561
Thank you guys so much
for coming.

1:10:00.597 --> 1:10:02.305
I'm gonna go look around.

1:10:07.039 --> 1:10:09.043
Um...

1:10:09.078 --> 1:10:10.643
Can I talk to you for a sec?

1:10:11.582 --> 1:10:12.645
Sure.

1:10:22.885 --> 1:10:25.559
Tiger asked me to
move in with him.

1:10:28.764 --> 1:10:29.959
What?

1:10:31.701 --> 1:10:32.764
Wow.

1:10:36.202 --> 1:10:37.571
What did you say?

1:10:38.567 --> 1:10:39.639
That I wanted to.

1:10:42.437 --> 1:10:43.907
Yeah.

1:10:44.883 --> 1:10:46.415
I'm really happy for you.

1:10:47.049 --> 1:10:48.848
Yeah, right.

1:10:48.884 --> 1:10:50.518
No, I am.

1:10:56.424 --> 1:10:58.257
I'll visit.
It's not like I'm dying.

1:10:58.292 --> 1:11:00.253
-I know, I know.

1:11:02.658 --> 1:11:03.927
But I'll miss you too.

1:11:05.493 --> 1:11:06.600
Yeah.

1:11:10.667 --> 1:11:13.101
Will you be okay on your own?

1:11:16.339 --> 1:11:17.512
Yeah.

1:11:18.750 --> 1:11:19.943
I'll be okay.

1:12:46.531 --> 1:12:47.798
Before we begin,

1:12:47.833 --> 1:12:50.368
I want to thank everyone
for coming tonight.

1:12:50.403 --> 1:12:51.903
Given current events,

1:12:51.939 --> 1:12:54.543
I'm sure that decision was
a struggle for some of you.

1:12:54.578 --> 1:12:57.870
I'm sure some of you wondered
if you should be here

1:12:57.906 --> 1:12:59.741
out of concern and safety.

1:12:59.776 --> 1:13:01.241
And I'm sure that for others,

1:13:01.276 --> 1:13:03.451
there's nowhere else
that you would rather be.

1:13:03.786 --> 1:13:06.848
Regardless of whatever internal
wrestling you went through,

1:13:06.884 --> 1:13:08.715
I wish everybody
a Shabbat shalom.

1:13:08.751 --> 1:13:10.756
A Shabbat of peace.

1:13:10.792 --> 1:13:14.058
For nearly 2,000 years,
Jews have lived in exile.

1:13:14.560 --> 1:13:16.596
We've resided in many places,

1:13:16.632 --> 1:13:19.532
but many of them have
never truly been homes.

1:13:19.567 --> 1:13:21.998
Wherever we go,
for whatever reason,

1:13:22.034 --> 1:13:24.837
people decide that we
don't deserve to be there.

1:13:25.573 --> 1:13:27.333
I'm proud to be
a resident of Billings,

1:13:27.369 --> 1:13:30.443
a city that collectively,
Jew and non-Jew alike,

1:13:30.479 --> 1:13:33.449
said no,
we will not tolerate this.

1:13:33.485 --> 1:13:37.220
An attack on one of us is
an attack on all of us.

1:13:37.255 --> 1:13:38.616
Let us pray for those
whose hearts

1:13:38.652 --> 1:13:41.280
are going down
the road to hatred

1:13:41.316 --> 1:13:44.722
be turned away,
and to learn to accept others.

1:13:44.758 --> 1:13:46.689
And let anyone who
seeks to marginalize

1:13:46.724 --> 1:13:48.727
and divide be unsuccessful,

1:13:48.763 --> 1:13:51.895
as people here in the synagogue
and in this city

1:13:51.930 --> 1:13:55.329
stand up and said
this is not acceptable.

1:14:15.156 --> 1:14:16.383
Amen.

1:14:37.044 --> 1:14:40.807
May God bless you with all good
and keep you from all evil.

1:14:40.843 --> 1:14:42.243
May it be so.

1:14:42.279 --> 1:14:44.584
May God enlighten your heart
with immortal wisdom

1:14:44.619 --> 1:14:46.582
and grace you with
eternal knowledge.

1:14:46.618 --> 1:14:48.281
May it be so.

1:14:48.317 --> 1:14:51.592
May God lift up
merciful countenance upon you

1:14:51.627 --> 1:14:54.122
-for eternal peace.
May it be so.

1:14:54.158 --> 1:14:56.533
-Shabbat shalom.
-Shabbat shalom.
