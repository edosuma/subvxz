really good down low,

06:34.769 --> 06:36.813
but it was a little bit
inaccurate down there.

06:36.855 --> 06:39.858
But once you got up in that
tenor section of your voice,

06:39.899 --> 06:42.902
it was just so clear
and so powerful.

You can pick other songs
that don't live down

I think that's the whole point

07:00.086 --> 07:03.048

is to get over that hump.

Very nice. Very nice.

Gwen: So good.

29:24.139 --> 29:26.099
Hello. [ Laughs ]
Yes.

29:26.141 --> 29:28.101
Hi! What is your name?

29:28.143 --> 29:29.686
My name's Kayla,
I'm 30 years old,

29:29.728 --> 29:31.604
and I'm from Bisbee, Arizona.

29:31.646 --> 29:34.357
There's, like, somebody whose
essence you remind me of.

29:34.399 --> 29:37.152
For me, it was a cross between
Fiona Apple and Stevie Nicks.

29:37.193 --> 29:39.029
Yes! Yeah!
Oh, that's -- that's amazing.

29:39.070 --> 29:40.780
Yeah.
I love Stevie Nicks.

29:40.822 --> 29:42.073
I got the vibe. [ Laughs ]

29:42.115 --> 29:43.283
You have
a spectacular tone.

29:43.324 --> 29:45.326
It's, like,
so raw and so emotional.

29:45.368 --> 29:46.995
I'm really excited
for your journey.

29:47.037 --> 29:49.622
I'm gonna let you guys
just freakin' fight.

29:49.664 --> 29:50.957
Physically.

29:50.999 --> 29:52.584
I love John Legend.
I love Gwen.

29:52.625 --> 29:55.420
Growing up, I annoyed my family
listening to you.

29:55.462 --> 29:58.673
Yes!
I love annoying people.

29:58.715 --> 30:00.216
[ Laughs ]

30:00.258 --> 30:02.427
What I love is somebody
that sounds, you know,

30:02.469 --> 30:05.263
super original,
that channels their heart,

30:05.305 --> 30:07.640
that tells a story
with the way that they sing.

30:07.682 --> 30:09.851
But not only that,
just the tone of your voice

30:09.893 --> 30:11.478
is so pretty,
so palatable.
Thank you.

30:11.519 --> 30:14.230
Something I would really
listen to in my real life.

30:14.272 --> 30:16.399
And we could be
a really good match,

30:16.441 --> 30:17.984
so I'd love
to coach you.

30:18.026 --> 30:20.487
Aww.
Thank you. So sweet.

30:20.528 --> 30:22.655
I think Gwen and I,
we turned around

30:22.697 --> 30:23.948
at almost exactly
the same time.

30:23.990 --> 30:25.158
Yeah, that was amazing.

30:25.200 --> 30:26.493
And it felt like a record

30:26.534 --> 30:29.287
that you want to cozy up
by the fireplace

30:29.329 --> 30:31.206
and drink some hot chocolate
or some whiskey

30:31.247 --> 30:33.041
or whatever gets you
through the night.

30:33.083 --> 30:35.168
How chocolate or whiskey?
Same thing.

30:35.210 --> 30:36.753
That vibe,
it just felt so intimate

30:36.795 --> 30:38.171
and it felt so authentic.

30:38.213 --> 30:39.214
You're a great vocalist.

30:39.255 --> 30:40.507
Thank you so much.

30:40.548 --> 30:42.258
And I think you're
great artist, too.

30:42.300 --> 30:44.135
Congratulations.
Great job.

30:44.177 --> 30:45.345
Thank you so much.

30:45.387 --> 30:47.222
Who do you pick
as your coach?

30:47.263 --> 30:49.724
Oh, man. [ Chuckles ]

30:49.766 --> 30:52.936

30:52.977 --> 30:54.688
Come on.

30:54.729 --> 30:56.481
Ah!

30:56.523 --> 30:58.316
Who's she gonna pick?
I don't know.

30:58.358 --> 30:59.776
Those are
her two favorite.

30:59.818 --> 31:02.153
Come on, John.
John, come on. Come on.

31:02.195 --> 31:03.571
[ Laughs ]

31:03.613 --> 31:06.032
I think, um, I'm gonna have
to choose Gwen.

31:06.074 --> 31:08.410
Oh! Yes!
Yes!

31:08.451 --> 31:09.619
Yes!

31:09.661 --> 31:11.246

31:15.583 --> 31:17.752
Gwen:
I loved Kayla right away.

31:17.794 --> 31:20.296
I loved her voice.
I loved her song choice.

31:20.338 --> 31:22.716
I can't wait to hear
what you do.

31:22.757 --> 31:24.134
And then, of course,
she just has

31:24.175 --> 31:26.177
a really good spirit
and attitude.

31:26.219 --> 31:27.762
Thank you so much.
I'll see you later.

31:27.804 --> 31:29.389
[ Cheers and applause ]

31:29.431 --> 31:31.891
Blake: Kayla did one of
my all-time favorite songs,

31:31.933 --> 31:33.518
but I decided to stay out of it

31:33.560 --> 31:35.395
when I saw my wife
had hit her button.

31:35.437 --> 31:38.148
You know, if there's one
redeeming thing about the fact

31:38.189 --> 31:39.733
that the girls are killing it,

31:39.774 --> 31:44.112
it's that John's really
not doing any better than I am,

31:44.154 --> 31:45.530
and that makes me happy.

31:45.572 --> 31:46.740
I won!

31:46.781 --> 31:48.908
I am on fire today.

31:48.950 --> 31:50.118
You beat me!

31:50.160 --> 31:51.745
She's good. I like her.
I do, too.

31:51.786 --> 31:53.788
This season,
the talent just keeps getting

31:53.830 --> 31:54.998
better and better.

31:55.040 --> 32:00.295
* I've been in so many places *

32:00.337 --> 32:02.756
* In my life and time *

32:02.797 --> 32:05.300
Hit it!

32:05.342 --> 32:08.553
* I've sung a lot of songs *

32:08.595 --> 32:10.096
I got you!

32:10.138 --> 32:13.224
You're really deeply connected
to your heart and your soul,

32:13.266 --> 32:14.851
and it just seemed
very genuine.

32:14.893 --> 32:18.229
Destiny's a powerhouse singer,
but she's still a little bit raw

32:18.271 --> 32:19.689
and she has room to grow,

32:19.731 --> 32:21.900
and I think that we're going
to be able to figure out

32:21.941 --> 32:24.110
a little more dynamics
with her voice.

32:24.152 --> 32:25.779
It's gonna be fun
to work with her.

32:25.820 --> 32:27.364
Blake: Gwen's killing it.

32:27.405 --> 32:30.492
She's actually the returning
champion out of the four of us.

32:30.533 --> 32:33.161
She's the one that we got
to try to beat.

32:33.203 --> 32:34.621
* White shirt, now *

* Think you're so *

32:45.340 --> 32:47.592
* Criminal *

32:47.634 --> 32:50.679
I turned around
because I love this song

32:50.720 --> 32:52.430
and this voice
that I wouldn't expect,

32:52.472 --> 32:54.057
and you have
a beautiful tone.

32:54.099 --> 32:55.308
Camila: I love Eric Who.

32:55.350 --> 32:57.143

32:57.185 --> 33:02.148
and I love the spunky, creative
energy that I have on my team.

33:02.190 --> 33:03.400
Honey, you look good!

33:03.441 --> 33:04.567

Yes, I love it!

33:06.903 --> 33:09.489
John: Gwen and Camila
are crushing it this season

33:09.531 --> 33:11.700
and me and Blake,
we got to catch up.

33:11.741 --> 33:12.992
Welcome, Eric.

33:13.034 --> 33:15.120
The boys are out here.
They have no back pain.

33:15.161 --> 33:19.124
But Gwen and I, we're gonna
need to take some ointment,

33:19.165 --> 33:20.834
some topical cream,

33:20.875 --> 33:25.255
because we are carrying
this season on our backs.

33:32.053 --> 33:33.388
* This is "The Voice" *

33:33.430 --> 33:35.849

Welcome back to "The Voice."

33:35.890 --> 33:37.642
I feel like something
is gonna happen.

33:37.684 --> 33:39.728
You get the urge
to look over your seat.

33:39.769 --> 33:41.479
Yes.

Parijita:
It's crazy that I'm moments away

33:43.440 --> 33:44.941
from performing
in front of these coaches

33:44.983 --> 33:47.610
that I've watched with my family
since Season 1.

33:47.652 --> 33:50.739
The show really brought
our family together.

33:50.780 --> 33:52.699
My cousins and I,
we used to play "Voice"

33:52.741 --> 33:55.660
and take little chairs
and pretend to be the coaches,

33:55.702 --> 33:57.495
and our family
would be the audience.

33:57.537 --> 33:58.580

My name is Parijita Bastola,

I'm 17 years old, and my family
is originally from Nepal.

34:03.752 --> 34:07.088
Nepal is located
in Southeast Asia,

34:07.130 --> 34:08.673
in between India and China.

34:08.715 --> 34:10.967
Being Nepalese is very important
to my identity

34:11.009 --> 34:12.510
and who I am as an artist.

34:12.552 --> 34:14.596
I love eating
my Nepalese food

34:14.637 --> 34:17.599
and really being wrapped up
in my culture.

34:17.640 --> 34:20.268
My parents came to the U.S.
about 25 years ago

34:20.310 --> 34:22.520
to flee from
political unrest in Nepal,

34:22.562 --> 34:24.397
and then they tried
to bring my sister,

34:24.439 --> 34:27.275
but with immigration,
it did not work out,

34:27.317 --> 34:30.487
so they had to put her
in a boarding school in India.

34:30.528 --> 34:34.157
My sister and my parents
were separated for 11 years.

34:34.199 --> 34:36.242
This was very hard on my family.

34:36.284 --> 34:38.703
Even though we were half
a world apart,

34:38.745 --> 34:43.958
we were still able to maintain
a connection through letters.

34:44.000 --> 34:47.671
She would send me her
favorite songs, like Shakira

34:47.712 --> 34:50.173
and Beyoncé and Alicia Keys.

34:50.215 --> 34:51.758
This kind of R&B influence,

34:51.800 --> 34:53.802

like, my Nepalese heritage
into my singing and my music.

38:35.065 --> 38:37.776
That's been really,
really important to me, too.

38:37.817 --> 38:40.320
I would be so excited
to work with you.

38:40.362 --> 38:42.822
Thank you.
That means a lot.
Yeah.

38:42.864 --> 38:45.825
You're so natural
and very unique.

38:45.867 --> 38:47.327
You're so in touch
with your heart.

38:47.369 --> 38:49.704
It's incredible. I know that
it would be really fun

38:49.746 --> 38:51.706
to work together,
and I have a lot to offer.

38:51.748 --> 38:55.710
I have a lot of experience,
and I love you.

38:55.752 --> 38:57.087
Did you bring
your family with you?

38:57.128 --> 38:59.464
Yes. I brought my mom,
my aunt, and my dad.

38:59.506 --> 39:00.757
Oh, my God.
Yeah.

39:00.799 --> 39:02.550
Hi!
Hi!

39:02.592 --> 39:05.261
"The Voice," since Season 1, has
always been our family's show.

39:05.303 --> 39:07.097
They owned a small restaurant.
Wow.
Oh, wow.

39:07.138 --> 39:09.766
And they specifically closed
on Mondays

39:09.808 --> 39:11.643
to watch
"The Voice" on Monday night.

39:11.685 --> 39:12.894
Really?
Oh, my God.

39:12.936 --> 39:14.771
How cute!
[ Cheers and applause ]

39:14.813 --> 39:16.648
When you listen to music,
are you listening

39:16.690 --> 39:18.024
to a lot of music
from the area

39:18.066 --> 39:19.234
where your family's
come from?

39:19.275 --> 39:20.902
I do listen
to Nepalese music,

39:20.944 --> 39:23.154
but my favorite genre
is R&B and soul.

39:23.196 --> 39:27.409
I know a coach up here
that would be very good

39:27.450 --> 39:30.245
at working on R&B/soul.

39:30.286 --> 39:31.871
[ Laughter ]

39:31.913 --> 39:35.250
The best artists are able to
bring the music of their culture

39:35.291 --> 39:40.005
and of their roots into the
wider global landscape of music.

39:40.046 --> 39:42.757
I think your voice is
that kind of transcendent voice,

39:42.799 --> 39:45.135
and it would be an honor for me
to work with you.

39:45.176 --> 39:46.678
Thank you.
That means a lot.

39:46.720 --> 39:48.221
[ Cheers and applause ]

39:48.263 --> 39:52.851
I know good and well that
I'm in over my head here.

[ Laughter ]
Who knew Blake Shelton
was the underdog on "The Voice"?

39:56.146 --> 39:58.398
I know. It's true,
but it doesn't mean

39:58.440 --> 40:01.443
that I'm also not
as big of a fan of yours

40:01.484 --> 40:02.819
as everybody else
is here.

40:02.861 --> 40:05.947
There is nobody else
like you on my team.

40:05.989 --> 40:09.034
I also have been on
a singing competition show.

40:09.075 --> 40:11.161
Oh, my gosh.
[ Laughs ]

40:11.202 --> 40:13.288
Blake, you say a lot
of dumb things.

40:13.329 --> 40:14.831
This is the dumbest one.

40:14.873 --> 40:16.207
Have you been
in a girl group, too?

40:16.249 --> 40:18.626
Uh...
It's not too late, Blake.

40:18.668 --> 40:20.086
[ Laughter ]

40:20.128 --> 40:21.963
Uh,
let me just say this.

40:22.005 --> 40:24.674
You know what? Screw it.
Pick -- Pick a coach.

40:24.716 --> 40:26.092
Oh, my gosh!

40:26.134 --> 40:27.886
Before I pick,
I wanted to give a little gift

40:27.927 --> 40:30.680
to the four coaches.
Oh, my goodness.

40:30.722 --> 40:34.100
These are <i>rudraksha</i>beads,
and they come from Nepal.
Camila: This is so cool.

40:34.142 --> 40:35.477
Oh, my gosh.

40:35.518 --> 40:36.978
Thank you so much.

40:37.020 --> 40:39.314
How pretty.
Thank you.

Thank you.

[ Cheers and applause ]

40:41.858 --> 40:43.318
Oh, my God.

40:43.360 --> 40:44.986
We'd all be so lucky
to work with you,

40:45.028 --> 40:47.530
but who do you pick
as your coach?

I've been losing a lot,

to build up Team Legend.

beautiful performance.

I think she is one
of our most formidable artists

41:36.579 --> 41:38.123
in this competition this season.

How do we say
"thank you"?

with the necklace.

41:45.922 --> 41:47.340
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

41:47.382 --> 41:49.134
We should have just cut
to the chase,

41:49.175 --> 41:51.219
and John Legend should have just
been like, "Okay, let's go."

41:51.261 --> 41:52.971
It's funny because
15 minutes ago,

41:53.013 --> 41:54.848
she was looking back there.
"John?

41:54.889 --> 41:56.766
Are we picking John?
John."
I know.

Did you see her do it?
Yes.
