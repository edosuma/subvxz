00:00.298 --> 00:02.177
<i>PHIL: Previously on
The Amazing Race...</i>

00:02.550 --> 00:04.509
<i>Five teams continued racing
through Bali.</i>

00:04.510 --> 00:06.829
<i>The Detour was full of birds...</i>

00:06.830 --> 00:09.029
I hope it doesn't
cock-a-doodle-doo-doo on me.

00:09.030 --> 00:11.029
<i>...and totally nuts.</i>

00:11.030 --> 00:12.549
Oh.

00:12.550 --> 00:14.549
Uh!

00:14.550 --> 00:17.989
<i>At the double U-Turn
Tyler and Korey made a big move.</i>

00:17.990 --> 00:19.789
I think Burnie and Kurt.
-We're doing it.

00:19.790 --> 00:21.949
We love them but if we want
a chance in the finals,

00:21.950 --> 00:23.109
they're the biggest threat.

00:23.110 --> 00:24.269
We got to do it.

00:24.988 --> 00:27.907
<i>And gamers Bernie and Ashley
followed suit.</i>

00:27.908 --> 00:30.267
The only way they stand a chance
is if they U-turn somebody else.

00:30.268 --> 00:32.027
Let's U-turn Tyler and Korey.

00:32.028 --> 00:33.667
They did the move to get us
eliminated.

00:33.668 --> 00:34.827
Let's go. Freak!

00:34.828 --> 00:37.788
<i>At the Roadblock, Cole
conquered his fear of heights.</i>

00:39.988 --> 00:41.147
He did it.

00:41.148 --> 00:44.227
<i>Tyler and Korey
won their second leg in a row...</i>

00:44.228 --> 00:45.908
(LAUGHS)

00:47.628 --> 00:50.347
<i>..and helped send their rivals
out of the race.</i>

00:50.348 --> 00:54.147
Brodie and Kurt, unfortunately, you
have been eliminated from the race.

00:54.148 --> 00:57.307
<i>Four teams remain.
Who will be eliminated next?</i>

00:57.308 --> 00:58.427
That hot guy,

00:58.428 --> 01:00.908
he stretched me OUT!

01:02.000 --> 01:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:53.388 --> 01:54.547
Where are we going?

01:54.548 --> 01:55.787
Oh, my God.

01:55.788 --> 01:58.857
"Fly to Shenzhen,
The Silicon Valley of China."

01:58.858 --> 02:03.587
Teams will now leave the tropics
of Indonesia and fly more than

02:03.588 --> 02:08.026
2,000 miles <i>to the most populated
country on earth, China.</i>

02:08.027 --> 02:12.467
<i>And the city of Shenzhen - China's
first Special Economic Zone -</i>

02:12.468 --> 02:15.347
<i>allowing it to grow
from a small fishing village</i>

02:15.348 --> 02:19.667
<i>to a major economic powerhouse
in just 35 years.</i>

02:19.668 --> 02:23.227
Teams will find their next clue
here in the departure hall of

02:23.228 --> 02:25.507
Shenzhen's futuristic-looking
airport.

02:25.508 --> 02:27.147
We've got to go to a travel agency.

02:27.148 --> 02:28.707
Yeah, you want to run?

02:28.708 --> 02:30.707
Let's do it. We're going to China.
-China.

02:30.708 --> 02:32.787
Find a taxi. There's a taxi.
-Alright, flag it down.

02:32.788 --> 02:33.947
Taxi.

02:33.948 --> 02:35.747
Our next clue is in the airport.

02:35.748 --> 02:38.577
TYLER: We knew if we were going
to U-turn somebody,

02:38.578 --> 02:40.667
it was probably going to be
the Frisbee boys.

02:40.668 --> 02:43.457
I felt this was our chance
to take out maybe

02:43.458 --> 02:45.107
one of the biggest threats
of the season.

02:45.108 --> 02:46.347
I don't regret it.

02:46.348 --> 02:49.267
Without the Frisbee boys,
anybody really has a chance.

02:49.268 --> 02:50.467
I know that the Dancers

02:50.468 --> 02:52.587
are working out how
they communicate.

02:52.588 --> 02:55.827
Ask him, can he take rupiahs?

02:55.828 --> 02:58.347
Why are you telling me to ask him?

02:58.348 --> 03:00.347
10, 12, 14...
-Can't you talk?

03:00.348 --> 03:04.107
I've seen a new life
in Sheri and Cole's eyes.

03:04.108 --> 03:06.147
Let's go!
-We're going to China.

03:06.148 --> 03:07.907
KOREY: And Burnie and Ashley
are a really good team

03:07.908 --> 03:10.707
but they've just been getting
a lot of second places.

03:10.708 --> 03:13.107
If they want to come to the final
three and get second place

03:13.108 --> 03:14.947
there as well, we're happy
to let them do that.

03:14.948 --> 03:16.227
More than welcome.

03:16.228 --> 03:18.107
Yeah, I think we're here.
-Great.

03:18.108 --> 03:19.467
Let's go.

03:19.468 --> 03:24.107
Hi, we are booking travel
to Shenzhen.

03:24.108 --> 03:25.787
We're going to... same as them.

03:25.788 --> 03:29.347
This guy said that there are tons
of tickets available so...

03:29.348 --> 03:32.827
Do you want to tell the other teams
we connected through Kuwait?

03:32.828 --> 03:34.387
And you think we're the villains?

03:34.388 --> 03:36.307
(CHORTLES)
-We just had a U-Turn.

03:36.308 --> 03:37.867
We didn't know you guys
were in front of us.

03:37.868 --> 03:39.187
Oh, is that what was up?

03:39.188 --> 03:40.267
Got it.

03:40.268 --> 03:41.987
BURNIE: We're gamers and so using

03:41.988 --> 03:44.027
the U-Turn to the best
possible strategy,

03:44.028 --> 03:45.507
that just came naturally to us.

03:45.508 --> 03:48.747
And now there's less teams that
we have to beat for number one.

03:48.748 --> 03:50.387
They're hashtag the villains.

03:50.388 --> 03:52.028
(CHUCKLES)
-How dare you?

03:52.988 --> 03:54.467
Hola!
-Hello.

03:54.468 --> 03:56.187
Here comes another team.

03:56.188 --> 03:57.427
Surprise, surprise.

03:57.428 --> 04:00.387
COLE: We knew several legs ago
that we were getting

04:00.388 --> 04:02.227
into, like, the best of the best

04:02.228 --> 04:05.227
and we just aren't really up
to par with these other teams.

04:05.228 --> 04:07.707
I've never been to China, ever.

04:07.708 --> 04:11.467
I've eaten Chinese food,
I've been to Chinatown in Alabama.

04:11.468 --> 04:12.867
That's as Chinese as I've gotten.

04:12.868 --> 04:14.787
I don't think it's the same.
-Not the same whatsoever.

04:14.788 --> 04:17.827
Believe it or not, every leg
we have been trying to win!

04:17.827 --> 04:19.216
We've been trying to win.

04:19.218 --> 04:22.387
It's not, like, we purposely want
second-to-last every time.

04:22.388 --> 04:28.188
It looks like we're all on
the 1:45am flight to Shenzhen.

04:32.588 --> 04:36.508
<i>PHIL: All teams are now flying
to Shenzhen, China.</i>

04:44.268 --> 04:46.307
Let's go, Ash.

04:46.308 --> 04:48.427
We've just arrived at
Shenzhen Airport

04:48.428 --> 04:50.027
and right now trying to find
the departure hall

04:50.028 --> 04:51.507
because that's where our clue is.

04:51.508 --> 04:53.467
You guys think it's up?
Yeah, let's go up.

04:53.468 --> 04:54.777
Let's go, y'all.

04:54.778 --> 04:56.147
I see it, Tyler.

04:56.148 --> 04:57.707
Here.

04:57.708 --> 04:59.267
Let's get out of here.

04:59.268 --> 05:00.747
Go, go. Get it out.

05:00.748 --> 05:04.827
"Make your way by bus and train
to the Eiffel Tower."

05:04.828 --> 05:07.217
It's got to be that world of wonder.

05:07.218 --> 05:09.027
I know where we're going.
All the way down.

05:09.028 --> 05:11.387
Just be discreet in case you see
any other teams.

05:11.388 --> 05:12.627
Hide your clues.

05:12.628 --> 05:14.067
Yeah, hide them. Put them away.

05:14.068 --> 05:15.908
Do you where the departure hall?

05:17.748 --> 05:18.827
OK.

05:18.828 --> 05:20.427
(CHUCKLES)

05:20.428 --> 05:21.707
That was awesome!

05:21.708 --> 05:23.627
Hey, Mom,
let's exchange our currency.

05:23.628 --> 05:25.827
Here we go. Currency exchange.

05:25.828 --> 05:28.107
There it is right there.
Let's see what we got.

05:28.108 --> 05:30.187
Eiffel Tower. That's in the...

05:30.188 --> 05:32.347
That's in the Window of the World.
-World...

05:32.348 --> 05:34.107
There's Cole and Sheri.

05:34.108 --> 05:35.267
Be discreet.

05:35.268 --> 05:36.387
Did you guys find it?

05:36.388 --> 05:38.948
No. We're just changing money
and looking for the clue.

05:41.228 --> 05:42.787
What's up there?

05:42.788 --> 05:44.027
It's just, like, chaos up there.

05:44.028 --> 05:45.067
Yeah.

05:45.068 --> 05:46.347
We need to get local currency.

05:46.348 --> 05:47.507
That's it.

05:47.508 --> 05:48.827
Want to change money
with the rest of us

05:48.828 --> 05:49.907
and then go on a search again?

05:49.908 --> 05:52.147
For what?
-The clue.

05:52.148 --> 05:53.587
You got it?
-Yeah, we got the clue.

05:53.588 --> 05:55.467
Did you get it too?
-Uh-uh.

05:55.468 --> 05:57.748
Really? There's not many left.

05:59.628 --> 06:01.667
Dude! You, like, blew our cover.

06:01.668 --> 06:03.347
Is the departure hall
on the fourth floor?

06:03.348 --> 06:05.387
Third floor.
-Thank you.

06:05.388 --> 06:07.507
It was just a frustrating moment

06:07.508 --> 06:10.827
because there we were caught
not telling Sheri and Cole

06:10.828 --> 06:13.187
when we didn't have to tell them
anything in the first place.

06:13.188 --> 06:15.947
It's the last one,
so Tyler and Korey did...

06:15.948 --> 06:17.428
They did have theirs.
-Yep.

06:18.748 --> 06:20.747
This is our bus.
-Alright, let's go.

06:20.748 --> 06:22.147
Let's hope yellow didn't make it.

06:22.148 --> 06:24.267
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

06:24.268 --> 06:26.387
Cole, what's the name of the bus?
-M416.

06:26.388 --> 06:27.707
Buses. There's a bus.

06:27.708 --> 06:29.627
(QUIETLY) Get on the bus!

06:29.628 --> 06:31.747
Cole, Cole, Cole!

06:31.748 --> 06:34.707
Missed it. Dammit!

06:34.708 --> 06:36.747
I mean, we're standing there
and Burnie comes up to us.

06:36.748 --> 06:38.307
"Does everyone know where
they're going?"

06:38.308 --> 06:39.747
And they're holding the clue
in their hand.

06:39.748 --> 06:42.267
And we're like,
"No, we haven't found it yet."

06:42.268 --> 06:44.027
I love Sheri and Cole but like...

06:44.028 --> 06:46.027
Somebody has to go at this leg.

06:46.028 --> 06:48.067
Alright, let's move.

06:48.068 --> 06:49.387
Good job, guys.

06:49.388 --> 06:50.787
Did you see Korey and Tyler
at the Clue box?

06:50.788 --> 06:53.187
No. We were the last one to get
the clue and they just told us

06:53.188 --> 06:54.587
they didn't get it but they had it.

06:54.588 --> 06:56.667
They were intentionally
misdirecting us.

06:56.668 --> 06:59.228
They were sharing information
with the Dancers and nobody else.

07:01.868 --> 07:04.387
Let's go. Tickets up ahead.

07:04.388 --> 07:06.387
Looks like the subway here.
It's right here.

07:06.388 --> 07:07.827
We're going to Window of the World,
yeah?

07:07.828 --> 07:09.147
That's the one.

07:09.148 --> 07:10.707
It says 'To Train' this way.

07:10.708 --> 07:12.947
Do you see any other teams?
-No.

07:12.948 --> 07:14.188
Yeah!

07:15.988 --> 07:17.307
Here's tickets.

07:17.308 --> 07:19.667
Come on, Mamma.
-Cole, look for tickets.

07:19.668 --> 07:21.948
Let's go. Let's see if we can get
some separation.

07:23.668 --> 07:25.667
Window of the World.

07:25.668 --> 07:27.707
Oh, my gosh.

07:27.708 --> 07:29.347
Just jump on as fast as you can.

07:29.348 --> 07:30.907
Let's see if Cole and Sheri get on.

07:30.908 --> 07:32.427
We need to get on this?

07:32.428 --> 07:33.907
Let's go, let's go!

07:33.908 --> 07:36.307
Looking for Cole and Sheri to see
if they've made it on this train.

07:36.308 --> 07:37.948
This one?
Yes!

07:39.268 --> 07:41.427
No, no, next.

07:41.428 --> 07:43.347
Cole, get in.
Too late. Too late.

07:43.348 --> 07:44.707
Missed it.

07:44.708 --> 07:46.267
The yellow team
definitely got on that?

07:46.268 --> 07:47.388
Yeah.

07:56.828 --> 07:58.308
Eiffel Tower to the right!

07:59.428 --> 08:01.427
It's got to be on that first level.

08:01.428 --> 08:03.107
Whatever it is,
we can just help each other

08:03.108 --> 08:04.787
and get the hell out of here.

08:04.788 --> 08:05.907
Clue Box.

08:05.908 --> 08:07.348
Clue Box.
-I must do it.

08:08.388 --> 08:13.747
130 of the world's most iconic
landmarks can be found here

08:13.748 --> 08:17.107
<i>at this enormous theme park
called Window of the World,</i>

08:17.108 --> 08:18.507
<i>where Chinese visitors</i>

08:18.508 --> 08:20.307
<i>can experience famous
tourist attractions</i>

08:20.308 --> 08:21.827
<i>in their own backyard.</i>

08:21.828 --> 08:25.147
<i>It's time to test the geographical
knowledge of our teams</i>

08:25.148 --> 08:27.427
<i>who must solve a series of riddles,</i>

08:27.428 --> 08:29.987
<i>collecting location stickers
as they go.</i>

08:29.988 --> 08:33.467
<i>This immigration officer
will stamp each correct answer.</i>

08:33.467 --> 08:36.827
<i>When they have them all,
they'll have their next clue.</i>

08:36.828 --> 08:38.107
I got this.

08:38.107 --> 08:39.626
Are you ready, Dana?
-Yeah.

08:39.628 --> 08:41.386
Want to do it together?
-Yeah, for sure.

08:41.388 --> 08:43.787
Let's get down there before
any of the teams get here, guys.

08:43.788 --> 08:45.057
Burnie is going to be quick at this.

08:45.058 --> 08:49.507
Going into this leg, we knew
Burnie and Ashley were a threat.

08:49.508 --> 08:51.547
There they are.
-Whoo-hoo!

08:51.548 --> 08:53.427
I feel like they can
beat any of us and so

08:53.428 --> 08:56.227
when it comes to thinking about
who's going to the finals,

08:56.228 --> 08:59.387
that's not a team I want
to go up against.

08:59.388 --> 09:02.177
So right off the bat Dana and I
started working together.

09:02.178 --> 09:04.227
Since the very first
leg of the race

09:04.228 --> 09:05.627
we liked Dana and Matt.

09:05.628 --> 09:07.627
We were competitive
but friendly.

09:07.628 --> 09:10.587
So we said, "You know what,
let's work with people we like."

09:10.588 --> 09:11.907
Thank you so much.

09:11.908 --> 09:14.707
"Who wants to see the world?"
I have to do this Roadblock.

09:14.708 --> 09:18.667
We were given, like, a passport book
with riddles inside that gave you

09:18.668 --> 09:21.708
some clues about which monument
you were trying to run to.

09:21.909 --> 09:24.469
"The Sphinx is guardian of
these ancient structures of Giza."

09:24.504 --> 09:25.987
Do you know where it is?
-Yes, it's Egypt.

09:25.988 --> 09:29.388
TYLER: We were able to figure out
four of the riddles.

09:29.389 --> 09:30.889
"...famous battles here."

09:30.938 --> 09:32.107
Um...

09:32.108 --> 09:35.028
Um, what's that battlefield?
Isn't that in the US?

09:35.029 --> 09:36.229
"...mausolem framed by 4 minarets."

09:36.278 --> 09:37.297
Could that be Angkor Wat?

09:37.298 --> 09:39.667
The other ones were a little bit
more difficult.

09:39.668 --> 09:41.177
That's a possibility.
Put a question mark.

09:41.178 --> 09:42.468
Let's go to wherever's close.

09:43.468 --> 09:46.027
Sphinx, that's the Pyramids of Giza.

09:46.028 --> 09:48.667
I've got to find the Vatican.

09:48.668 --> 09:50.177
Those clues, some of them were

09:50.178 --> 09:51.588
very clear, like Vatican City...

09:51.589 --> 09:52.889
"Quasimodo rang the bell..."

09:52.938 --> 09:54.027
That's Notre Dame.

09:54.028 --> 09:57.787
"This palace is actually a mausoleum
framed by four minarets."

09:57.788 --> 09:58.867
Uh...

09:58.868 --> 10:01.467
..others were not so much like
a place where you would go

10:01.468 --> 10:03.467
to see battle reenactments.

10:03.468 --> 10:06.627
"Head of a lion, body of a fish."
I don't know that one.

10:06.628 --> 10:08.178
Alright, heading up this way.

10:11.228 --> 10:14.267
That's it.
-Oh, that's the mer-lion.

10:14.268 --> 10:16.747
DANA: You would have to run to that
monument and take a little sticker

10:16.748 --> 10:20.668
out of, like, a little case and put
that sticker in your passport book.

10:21.988 --> 10:23.228
Head of a lion, body of a fish.

10:24.828 --> 10:26.587
Here, put the trash in the box.

10:26.588 --> 10:27.937
Oh, my God, Dana.

10:27.938 --> 10:29.547
Pyramids of Giza, 15.

10:29.548 --> 10:30.867
I'm here.

10:30.868 --> 10:33.057
I've got to work my way
back up and around.

10:33.058 --> 10:35.908
I'm going by the Taj Mahal.
Should be right to my left.

10:36.938 --> 10:39.427
All three are already here.

10:39.428 --> 10:42.177
I don't know how we got
so far behind so fast.

10:42.178 --> 10:44.867
You got to do it.
-I'm doing it.

10:44.868 --> 10:47.147
Cole, I'm going to do my best
on this, OK?

10:47.148 --> 10:49.937
You know. We are in last
so if it's having to run,

10:49.938 --> 10:51.057
please, just run your hardest.

10:51.058 --> 10:52.388
No, no. I'll run.

10:53.908 --> 10:55.227
Here we go. Minarets.

10:55.228 --> 10:56.707
Taj Mahal.

10:56.708 --> 11:01.027
"This palace was actually a
mausoleum framed by four minarets."

11:01.028 --> 11:02.147
This is it. Taj Mahal.

11:02.148 --> 11:04.867
OK, we're going to work around
towards the Pyramids of Giza.

11:04.868 --> 11:06.147
Thank you very much.

11:06.148 --> 11:07.187
Mom, you got this, OK?

11:07.188 --> 11:09.227
Just take your time, do your best.
Stay calm, OK?

11:09.228 --> 11:12.627
Four... Oh, wow... minarets.

11:12.628 --> 11:13.787
Go, Mamma, go.

11:13.788 --> 11:15.027
Oh, golly.

11:15.028 --> 11:16.907
Golly, this is going to be tough.

11:16.908 --> 11:18.587
You got it, Mom.

11:18.588 --> 11:19.747
Stay calm.

11:19.748 --> 11:21.667
You're doing awesome, Mom!

11:21.668 --> 11:23.708
Don't cry, stay calm.

11:24.868 --> 11:26.907
Re-enactments of famous battles.

11:26.908 --> 11:28.388
I just don't know.

11:29.748 --> 11:32.107
"The head of a lion
and the body of a fish."

11:32.108 --> 11:33.508
I have no idea, honestly.

11:38.216 --> 11:41.495
"The Sphinx is the guardian of these
ancient structures of Giza."

11:41.496 --> 11:42.575
Is it Egypt?

11:42.576 --> 11:44.175
Oh, ah.

11:44.176 --> 11:46.415
Pyramids. I'm going here.

11:46.416 --> 11:47.615
There's Sheri.

11:47.616 --> 11:49.015
Sheri!

11:49.016 --> 11:50.455
Hey, y'all are working together?

11:50.456 --> 11:51.456
Yeah.

11:51.457 --> 11:54.375
Oh, crap.
I'm going to really be in trouble.

11:54.376 --> 11:55.816
We're in Paris.

11:55.817 --> 11:57.917
"Quasimodo rang the bell
of this French Gothic cathedral..."

11:58.016 --> 11:59.895
That's the Notre Dame.
-Yeah.

11:59.896 --> 12:02.535
Yes, Notre Dame, definitely.

12:02.536 --> 12:04.335
"Quasimodo rang the bell."

12:04.336 --> 12:06.975
"Quasimodo rang the bell."
That's Notre Dame.

12:06.976 --> 12:09.575
I see Notre Dame up here.
I just have to get to it.

12:09.576 --> 12:12.576
Pyramids. I'm going here.
Right here.

12:13.310 --> 12:15.657
"The Sphinx is guardian of
these ancient structures..."

12:16.016 --> 12:18.055
The Pyramids of Giza.
We've got three.

12:18.056 --> 12:19.815
We're killing the game, babe.

12:19.816 --> 12:22.735
Vatican City. We passed that, right?

12:22.736 --> 12:24.295
Dana, I'm so happy we're together!

12:24.296 --> 12:25.495
I know. Me too.

12:25.496 --> 12:27.015
Pyramids of Giza.

12:27.016 --> 12:28.655
I see two torn stickers in here

12:28.656 --> 12:31.455
which indicates which ones
they've taken.

12:31.456 --> 12:33.095
They're being stupid, actually.

12:33.096 --> 12:36.535
I'm going to take the backings
so other teams can't figure it out.

12:36.536 --> 12:37.655
Gives me an advantage.

12:37.656 --> 12:39.096
I get to work off
what they're doing.

12:40.176 --> 12:42.735
Oh. Uh!

12:42.736 --> 12:44.535
I got one down. That's awesome.

12:44.536 --> 12:48.175
"Quasimodo rang the bell
at this French Gothic cathedral."

12:48.176 --> 12:50.576
I think it's Notre Dame. OK.

12:52.856 --> 12:54.055
There's the Coliseum.

12:54.056 --> 12:56.295
Do you think the Pope gives
speeches at the Coliseum?

12:56.296 --> 12:57.655
No.
-Why not?

12:57.656 --> 12:59.135
He doesn't.
He just straight up doesn't.

12:59.136 --> 13:02.175
Look at this.
Re-enactments of famous battles.

13:02.176 --> 13:05.415
Yes. You're such a smart person!

13:05.416 --> 13:07.856
So what do we do about the Vatican?

13:10.376 --> 13:11.536
Vatican City.

13:13.016 --> 13:18.495
OK, I now have four down
and I'm working on my last two.

13:18.496 --> 13:21.615
Battles. Where is an arena?
Caesar's Palace?

13:21.616 --> 13:23.455
Yes!

13:23.456 --> 13:25.056
Yes, OK, I've just got
to get down there.

13:26.176 --> 13:28.256
I'm doing it all by myself too.

13:29.281 --> 13:32.059
"...a mausoleum framed
by 4 minarets."

13:33.416 --> 13:36.775
I don't know what a minaret is.

13:36.576 --> 13:38.295
We don't know what minarets are.

13:38.296 --> 13:40.535
"The palace is actually
a mausoleum." Does it say that?

13:40.536 --> 13:41.855
Is this a palace?
-Does it say palace?

13:41.856 --> 13:44.375
Yes, it definitely is.
It is a temple.

13:44.376 --> 13:46.655
Hey, you still looking for your clue
from the airport?

13:46.656 --> 13:49.575
God, Burnie seems like he knows
what he's doing.

13:49.576 --> 13:50.655
I don't know that he does.

13:50.656 --> 13:53.775
And if he does, he has the most
useless knowledge out of everyone.

13:53.776 --> 13:56.535
They're still looking.
Good, that makes me happy.

13:56.536 --> 14:00.495
Couple of jackasses working together
and can't be working by themselves.

14:00.496 --> 14:01.816
(CHUCKLES)

14:03.256 --> 14:04.656
Ooh, look at that.

14:06.216 --> 14:08.975
I found Notre Dame.

14:08.976 --> 14:10.935
Couple of them are going to be
really tough.

14:10.936 --> 14:13.855
"You can see the Pope give mass
at this Vatican City square."

14:13.856 --> 14:16.535
Here's a cross, here's a square.

14:16.536 --> 14:17.895
Vatican City.

14:17.896 --> 14:19.135
Alright, let's go check it.

14:19.136 --> 14:21.055
Want to go check it?
-Yeah, let's go check it.

14:21.056 --> 14:23.375
Oh, I can see them.

14:23.376 --> 14:25.575
Good job, guys. You got it.

14:25.576 --> 14:26.935
Come on, Dana.

14:26.936 --> 14:28.255
Can we check our passport?

14:28.256 --> 14:30.055
She's going to stamp the ones
that are right

14:30.056 --> 14:31.856
so we don't have to guess.

14:32.976 --> 14:35.175
Oh, my god, I have got to pee.

14:35.176 --> 14:36.775
Just pee your pants.

14:36.776 --> 14:38.335
I swear, just pee yourself.

14:38.336 --> 14:39.815
We didn't come here to lose.

14:39.816 --> 14:41.136
Fingers crossed.

14:42.856 --> 14:44.095
(BUZZ!)

14:44.096 --> 14:45.096
The palace is wrong.

14:46.096 --> 14:47.895
That's the only one.
That's the one we didn't know.

14:47.896 --> 14:49.375
Everything else...
Everything else is right.

14:49.376 --> 14:50.376
It's that one.

14:53.016 --> 14:55.855
I thought that Vatican City
is in Rome.

14:55.856 --> 14:58.375
Well, how many have you got?
You want to say?

14:58.376 --> 14:59.935
I don't got much.
-OK.

14:59.936 --> 15:01.175
And we are not sure of much.

15:01.176 --> 15:03.215
I mean, the last clue
is really vague.

15:03.216 --> 15:04.575
What does it say?

15:04.576 --> 15:07.295
The famous battle re-enactments.
-Literally no clue.

15:07.296 --> 15:09.255
I think it's Native Americans.
-Yeah, we have the same ones.

15:09.256 --> 15:10.775
We don't know.
-I think it's Native Americans.

15:10.776 --> 15:13.056
Good luck, guys.
-OK, thank you, you too.

15:16.696 --> 15:18.176
Huh.

15:19.936 --> 15:21.815
Just a quick look. There's a box.

15:21.816 --> 15:22.855
Wow.

15:22.856 --> 15:25.095
Vatican City. Holy crap.

15:25.096 --> 15:27.335
There's the Coliseum.
I'm going to go to the Coliseum

15:27.336 --> 15:29.375
and then I'll hook
around by the archery site.

15:29.376 --> 15:31.175
Oh, the Taj Mahal.
-We're looking for the Taj Mahal.

15:31.176 --> 15:33.175
We don't know if it's right,
we're just trying it.

15:33.176 --> 15:34.775
Coliseum of Italy.

15:34.776 --> 15:37.415
Re-enactment. Famous battle.
I am done.

15:37.416 --> 15:39.295
Tyler lied to me again.

15:39.296 --> 15:40.655
He knew what it was and lied to me.

15:40.656 --> 15:41.775
Good I didn't fall for it.

15:41.776 --> 15:44.215
This has got four things
surrounding it.

15:44.216 --> 15:46.375
That's the Taj Mahal.

15:46.376 --> 15:48.135
Yes.
-It's a mausoleum.

15:48.136 --> 15:50.015
It says it right there.
-Oh, my God.

15:50.016 --> 15:51.815
Let's get out of here, Ty.
We did it.

15:51.816 --> 15:54.015
Good job, baby. Good job.

15:54.016 --> 15:55.695
Show them who's a jackass now.

15:55.696 --> 15:57.775
Hello! Hello.

15:57.776 --> 15:58.776
There goes Burnie.

16:00.376 --> 16:01.496
She stamping my passport.

16:02.616 --> 16:04.415
All the places that I went.

16:04.416 --> 16:06.775
Been to Singapore, Notre Dame, down.

16:06.776 --> 16:08.095
Ash, get ready.

16:08.096 --> 16:09.656
Oh, he's saying get ready.

16:11.016 --> 16:12.735
Yes.
-WOMAN: Good.

16:12.736 --> 16:14.335
All good?

16:14.336 --> 16:16.015
Thank you! Yes.
-(SQUEALS)

16:16.016 --> 16:17.175
Is that mine? Thank you.

16:17.176 --> 16:20.255
I am so proud of you.
I'm so proud of you.

16:20.256 --> 16:22.895
"Make your way by subway
to Lychee Park

16:22.896 --> 16:25.775
"near the Moon Bridge
to receive your next clue."

16:25.776 --> 16:28.175
Tyler and Dana are absolutely
working together.

16:28.176 --> 16:29.375
Oh, yeah.

16:29.376 --> 16:31.575
The three amigos.

16:31.576 --> 16:33.175
Ta-da!

16:33.176 --> 16:34.336
I think Burnie is gone.

16:35.576 --> 16:37.215
You got it, guys!

16:37.216 --> 16:39.695
We think the last one
we needed was the Taj Mahal.

16:39.696 --> 16:41.815
It's a palace that's actually
a mausoleum.

16:41.816 --> 16:43.416
And I'm hoping for that stamp.

16:44.496 --> 16:45.855
Yes!

16:45.856 --> 16:47.415
Thank you so much.

16:47.416 --> 16:50.535
Thank you. Thank you. Let's go.

16:50.536 --> 16:52.775
Whoo! Good job, babe.

16:52.776 --> 16:55.335
We're going to a park.
-Open it.

16:55.336 --> 16:56.656
Five minutes.

16:57.776 --> 16:58.776
They just left.

16:58.777 --> 17:00.216
We can catch their train.

17:01.496 --> 17:03.016
And then there was one.

17:05.536 --> 17:06.734
That was so much running.

17:06.736 --> 17:08.494
I ran around the world eight times.

17:08.496 --> 17:10.645
This is line one.
-Is it east or west? -East.

17:10.646 --> 17:12.645
Check the map,
make sure we're on the right one.

17:12.646 --> 17:14.734
Yeah.
-Go.

17:14.736 --> 17:16.694
Grand theatre.
-Got it.

17:16.695 --> 17:18.615
We booked it to the station.

17:18.616 --> 17:21.015
And they're right in the other car.

17:21.016 --> 17:24.056
So, we caught up with them.
It's anybody's race for first.

17:25.415 --> 17:27.775
"Head of a lion
and body of the fish."

17:27.776 --> 17:29.255
I just don't know.

17:29.256 --> 17:32.175
I think my mom might be lost, maybe.

17:32.176 --> 17:33.366
Not it.

17:35.256 --> 17:37.455
I thought maybe an overview
might help.

17:37.456 --> 17:38.646
I'm so sorry, Cole.

17:40.056 --> 17:41.256
Oh, man.

17:46.539 --> 17:47.888
Ooh.

17:48.317 --> 17:51.126
What I have left are two things
that I do not know at all.

17:51.127 --> 17:53.557
So, I'm going to have
to ask somebody.

17:55.127 --> 17:56.767
Do y'all speak English?

17:57.887 --> 17:59.036
Oh, OK.

17:59.037 --> 18:00.556
Do you know a statue

18:00.557 --> 18:03.287
that has the head of a lion
and the body of a fish?

18:04.767 --> 18:06.037
That's the lion?

18:06.038 --> 18:07.888
This is in Singapore.

18:08.287 --> 18:09.316
Yes!

18:09.317 --> 18:11.796
Merlion, Singapore.

18:11.797 --> 18:14.126
One after the other. I'm doing it.

18:14.127 --> 18:17.167
The last one
I have to get is the palace.

18:18.287 --> 18:20.406
This is it, Lychee Park.

18:20.407 --> 18:21.727
Looking for the Moon Bridge.

18:23.317 --> 18:24.317
It's over there.

18:25.527 --> 18:28.206
Worst. Stairs.

18:28.207 --> 18:30.246
Ty, it's over here somewhere.
-Coming.

18:30.247 --> 18:31.406
Go, Ash.

18:31.407 --> 18:34.286
(SINGING)

18:34.287 --> 18:35.726
Hi, Phil.

18:35.727 --> 18:39.316
Teams will now choose
whether they take a modern commute

18:39.317 --> 18:42.796
or deliver some artwork
to a Shenzhen gallery.

18:42.797 --> 18:44.926
Commuter cycle or master of arts?

18:44.927 --> 18:49.316
This might be the most streamlined
way to commute in the world.

18:49.317 --> 18:53.246
<i>With your hands-free, it's an easy
way to carry your briefcase</i>

18:53.247 --> 18:56.486
<i>and a cup of coffee
without breaking a sweat.</i>

18:56.487 --> 18:59.286
<i>Of course, teams will have
no trouble at all</i>

18:59.287 --> 19:03.606
<i>mastering manoeuvres like this</i>
to get their next clue.

19:03.607 --> 19:05.886
<i>The village of Dafen
is believed to be</i>

19:05.887 --> 19:10.126
the largest mass producer
of oil paintings like this

19:10.127 --> 19:11.127
in the world.

19:11.128 --> 19:16.606
At one point, 10,000 expert painters
were working here at any given time.

19:16.607 --> 19:18.966
<i>Teams must choose one
who will give them</i>

19:18.967 --> 19:21.366
<i>a set of paintings
to deliver to a gallery</i>

19:21.367 --> 19:23.766
<i>where they'll have to hang them
to the exact specifications</i>

19:23.767 --> 19:25.556
<i>of the art dealer
for their next clue.</i>

19:25.557 --> 19:27.006
I think we're going to do
commuter cycle.

19:27.007 --> 19:28.366
We are going to do
the master of arts.

19:28.367 --> 19:29.886
Master of arts.
-Got to go to the village.

19:29.887 --> 19:31.527
We're going to do master of arts.
-Alright.

19:33.927 --> 19:36.246
Let's take the train. -Let's
take the train. Alright, let's go.

19:36.247 --> 19:37.886
Do we just take a cab there?
-Yes.

19:37.887 --> 19:40.766
Use the one up here. Taxi.

19:40.767 --> 19:42.886
Get in.
-Show him.

19:42.887 --> 19:43.966
Just get in.

19:43.967 --> 19:45.406
Just hope this
is faster than the subway

19:45.407 --> 19:48.007
'cause I think Burnie
and Ashley tried to take the subway.

19:49.007 --> 19:50.847
I wonder where Sheri is.

19:54.967 --> 19:56.726
OK, I just found the Taj Mahal.

19:56.727 --> 19:58.926
It's actually a mausoleum
framed by four minarets.

19:58.927 --> 20:00.966
I think this is correct.

20:00.967 --> 20:04.006
I am the only one left,
so everyone else got them right.

20:04.007 --> 20:05.486
Yeah, Mom!

20:05.487 --> 20:07.317
Whoo!

20:10.687 --> 20:11.847
They're stamping stuff.

20:13.767 --> 20:16.766
Oh, you got it? Good job, Mom.

20:16.767 --> 20:18.526
Thank you.

20:18.527 --> 20:20.166
Come on. Let's go!

20:20.167 --> 20:22.646
How far behind am I? A lot?

20:22.647 --> 20:24.887
I mean...
-Yeah. Sorry.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.846
Yeah, it's in here somewhere.
What's the clue say?

20:29.847 --> 20:32.556
Painter with a marked paintbrush.

20:32.557 --> 20:33.726
Holy crap.

20:33.727 --> 20:36.487
Oh, my God,
look at all these paintings.

20:37.687 --> 20:39.846
There's a marked brush.
Yay!

20:39.847 --> 20:41.847
Team number one! Whoo-hoo!

20:42.967 --> 20:45.207
Come on, babe. Move your ass.
-Alright.

20:46.527 --> 20:48.726
So many paintings here. Oh, my God.

20:48.727 --> 20:50.366
This could be a marked brush.

20:50.367 --> 20:51.367
I like these paintings.

20:51.368 --> 20:52.726
Let's do this. Will you take us?

20:52.727 --> 20:54.766
I don't know if we're first here,
but we've made good time

20:54.767 --> 20:56.167
whatever we did.

20:57.557 --> 20:59.726
Oh, I see them.
-Yes.

20:59.727 --> 21:01.486
And that's our delivery address.

21:01.487 --> 21:04.246
Oh, my God, Kor. Oopsy.

21:04.247 --> 21:05.366
Be careful with your paintings.

21:05.367 --> 21:07.366
Wow.
-And this is where we're going.

21:07.367 --> 21:08.646
OK.
-Come on, let's go.

21:08.647 --> 21:09.686
You got it?
-Yes.

21:09.687 --> 21:11.926
Careful.
-I got it.

21:11.927 --> 21:13.526
Who can we ask?

21:13.527 --> 21:14.527
Hello.

21:14.528 --> 21:16.526
Do you know where this is?

21:16.527 --> 21:18.886
(SPEAKS CHINESE)

21:18.887 --> 21:20.316
That way?

21:20.317 --> 21:22.486
It's nearby.
Feeling good, Ty.

21:22.487 --> 21:24.926
The other Detour was unicycling
with coffee and a briefcase.

21:24.927 --> 21:27.247
It just seems like nobody's
about to pick that.

21:29.767 --> 21:32.126
The commuter cycle
sounds like the more challenging,

21:32.127 --> 21:33.766
but it also means it could be
a lot faster too.

21:33.767 --> 21:35.486
So, we're going
to try to see if we can do it,

21:35.487 --> 21:36.846
see how well
we can do it in one heat

21:36.847 --> 21:39.006
and then if it's really bad,
we'll just switch, right?

21:39.007 --> 21:40.086
OK.
-OK.

21:40.087 --> 21:41.487
Alright, let's do this.

21:43.797 --> 21:45.597
This has got to be
the Moon Bridge right here.

21:47.007 --> 21:49.007
Yeah, Mom, that's them. That's them.

21:51.607 --> 21:53.567
OK, we're going
to do commuter cycle.

21:54.847 --> 21:55.887
(SINGING)

21:59.127 --> 22:00.127
This is so cool.

22:00.128 --> 22:01.886
172, 76, that's 80.

22:01.887 --> 22:03.886
It's right here, I see it.
-OK.

22:03.887 --> 22:06.206
I see it. Is this for you? Here.

22:06.207 --> 22:08.126
"Use the provided tools to hang
the paintings."

22:08.127 --> 22:10.326
But we've got to put
the clothes on first.

22:10.327 --> 22:12.166
Oh, we look so good.

22:12.167 --> 22:14.406
TYLER: As soon as we got our
paintings to the gallery,

22:14.407 --> 22:17.606
we had to unwrap them, and we tried
to lay them out on the floor

22:17.607 --> 22:19.806
and see if there was a consensus
of how they needed to be hung.

22:19.807 --> 22:21.006
No.

22:21.007 --> 22:22.166
That's the bottom.

22:22.167 --> 22:23.206
It's a bridge.

22:23.207 --> 22:24.686
It's upside down.

22:24.687 --> 22:26.366
It goes this way.
-Yes, you're right.

22:26.367 --> 22:28.326
For sure.
-I mean, that looks... right.

22:28.327 --> 22:30.526
So, let's get to work. OK.

22:30.527 --> 22:32.486
Just a couple of jocks
hanging paintings.

22:32.487 --> 22:34.726
Just a couple of carpenter jocks.

22:34.727 --> 22:36.086
(GASPS) Oh.

22:36.087 --> 22:37.646
(BANGS)

22:37.647 --> 22:39.606
Should we make sure it's level?

22:39.607 --> 22:42.126
That's not how you use a level.

22:42.127 --> 22:43.127
Oh, my God.
Oh, look!

22:43.128 --> 22:44.847
Oh, my God, that's cute.

22:46.207 --> 22:47.527
That's actually really cute.

22:48.647 --> 22:50.406
We need 3-1, OK?

22:50.407 --> 22:52.646
We need 3-1?
-Yeah.

22:52.647 --> 22:54.406
3-1, right here.
-Right here?

22:54.407 --> 22:55.966
Yes, this is it.

22:55.967 --> 22:58.126
So, we have to set it up
like a picture wall.

22:58.127 --> 22:59.127
Oh.

22:59.128 --> 23:01.646
I think they all might make
one picture.

23:01.647 --> 23:04.566
That's what I just said.
Alright, so this matches up.

23:04.567 --> 23:06.166
So, I think it is a puzzle.

23:06.167 --> 23:08.486
This is a mess,
this is not a picture.

23:08.487 --> 23:11.686
I mean, it doesn't say that they all
have to be flush, necessarily.

23:11.687 --> 23:13.286
Yes, it does.

23:13.287 --> 23:15.726
That's exactly what it says,
actually, and just use your head.

23:15.727 --> 23:17.366
Everything has to fit.

23:17.367 --> 23:19.206
Yeah, I think there's just gaps.

23:19.207 --> 23:20.326
I'm just wondering.

23:20.327 --> 23:21.327
I don't talk anymore.

23:21.328 --> 23:23.687
I just want to hang
these damn things on the wall.

23:26.407 --> 23:28.526
There's the commuters. See, babe,
there they are right there.

23:28.527 --> 23:30.247
Yay!
-Hey.

23:32.007 --> 23:33.286
Oh, these are great.

23:33.287 --> 23:34.566
Yeah, see, you're not sitting on it,

23:34.567 --> 23:36.686
so change into the provided
commuter wear.

23:36.687 --> 23:37.966
Alright, let's do this.

23:37.967 --> 23:41.086
ASHLEY: Part of the Detour
is a commute to work,

23:41.087 --> 23:43.126
and so you have
to put on your work clothes,

23:43.127 --> 23:45.046
which, in our case,
was a fancy suit.

23:45.047 --> 23:46.886
Can you show off? Whoo-hoo!
-See, these are easy.

23:46.887 --> 23:48.486
I think we can do it.
-Oh, yeah.

23:48.487 --> 23:50.246
I got this, I got this.

23:50.247 --> 23:51.846
You done?

23:51.847 --> 23:53.207
OK. OK, I got it.

23:54.447 --> 23:56.527
This is definitely
a learning experience.

23:58.327 --> 24:00.646
What?! How are they going so fast?

24:00.647 --> 24:01.647
Oop, got it, got it.

24:01.648 --> 24:04.886
I got it. I got it. I got it.

24:04.887 --> 24:06.246
Damn.

24:06.247 --> 24:08.446
You getting it, Burnie?
Like this?
Yeah, I feel pretty good about it.

24:08.447 --> 24:09.447
How are you?
-Nope.

24:09.448 --> 24:11.006
You don't feel good?
-Nope.

24:11.007 --> 24:12.486
I've never done anything like this.

24:12.487 --> 24:14.006
I thought I was good at balancing,

24:14.007 --> 24:17.286
but these guys
are showing me up big time.

24:17.287 --> 24:18.326
What are you thinking?

24:18.327 --> 24:20.326
I don't know how fast
I'm going to pick this up,

24:20.327 --> 24:21.886
but what do you think?
-We'll see.

24:21.887 --> 24:24.367
They're really cool, but I'm not
sure I can pick it up in time.

24:26.965 --> 24:28.604
That's money, baby.

24:28.605 --> 24:30.204
That's money, honey.

24:30.205 --> 24:31.324
That's right.

24:31.325 --> 24:34.564
We noticed that when the paintings
are flush against each other,

24:34.565 --> 24:36.684
it looks like they're missing
a part, but...

24:36.685 --> 24:38.644
Like this didn't match up.

24:38.645 --> 24:42.205
So, what we found out is
with the spacing it works.

24:43.725 --> 24:47.924
I hit my fingers about four times,
but that's OK.

24:47.925 --> 24:48.964
It actually looks good, Korey.

24:48.965 --> 24:50.685
This looks so badass.

24:54.501 --> 24:57.820
When I was saving up money to move
to LA to start dancing,

24:57.821 --> 24:59.820
I actually spent two years
fixing up houses

24:59.821 --> 25:01.220
and flipping them and selling them,

25:01.221 --> 25:04.460
so I haven't done
any carpentry in a while,

25:04.461 --> 25:07.581
but a little experience
from back in the day.

25:09.901 --> 25:12.701
That's right, I think. Right?
-It is.

25:14.741 --> 25:16.780
And see where we're at.

25:16.781 --> 25:18.260
How are we looking?

25:18.261 --> 25:19.380
It looks good to me.

25:19.381 --> 25:21.060
Wow. It looks really good.

25:21.061 --> 25:22.220
It's like some kind of bridge.

25:22.221 --> 25:23.221
OK, let's ask.

25:25.021 --> 25:26.060
Ta-da!

25:26.061 --> 25:27.140
It's beautiful.

25:27.141 --> 25:30.181
Oh, no.

25:31.341 --> 25:33.380
Oh, the line is not perfect
in that one?

25:33.381 --> 25:35.500
He's saying it's the spacing.

25:35.501 --> 25:38.060
I think he's saying that this needs
to fit between each and every...

25:38.061 --> 25:40.980
He's saying they all need to be able
to fit in between.

25:40.981 --> 25:44.781
I'm no artist, but it looks
like a work of art to me.

25:45.981 --> 25:49.980
Oh. He's saying maybe
that they're too close

25:49.981 --> 25:51.700
from the top to the middle one.

25:51.701 --> 25:53.700
He wants the level
to fit in between.

25:53.701 --> 25:54.860
MATT: I thought maybe we had it

25:54.861 --> 25:57.700
and they'd said there was a little
too much space on some

25:57.701 --> 26:00.420
and a little too little space
between some of the others.

26:00.421 --> 26:05.740
They wanted the level to fit
exactly between the rows.

26:05.741 --> 26:07.860
I'd rather go unicycle.
-We're not going to get freaked out.

26:07.861 --> 26:09.500
I'd rather go unicycle.

26:09.501 --> 26:12.941
We are 10 nails away from doing it.

26:17.821 --> 26:20.180
I think we're going to do
well on the unicycles.

26:20.181 --> 26:21.500
First try.

26:21.501 --> 26:25.021
First try, you're going to see me
on the little electric unicycle...

26:26.021 --> 26:28.261
..'cause I've got
really good balance.

26:30.021 --> 26:31.260
Ash, what are you thinking?

26:31.261 --> 26:32.700
This is hard.

26:32.701 --> 26:34.540
Oh, son of a bitch. OK.

26:34.541 --> 26:36.020
Is it going to take you
at least a half an hour?

26:36.021 --> 26:37.940
It might. I don't know.
It might take me a half an hour too.

26:37.941 --> 26:39.940
At this point, I'm just worried
we won't pick it up in time.

26:39.941 --> 26:41.020
Yeah.

26:41.021 --> 26:44.700
I'm also...
I'm also losing... stability.

26:44.701 --> 26:47.100
Alright, let's switch.
-Switch? -Let's switch.

26:47.101 --> 26:49.060
We don't have a choice.
-We're calling it. Got to switch.

26:49.061 --> 26:51.220
We're going to go. We're done.
We're not going to do it.

26:51.221 --> 26:53.501
We're going to lose our lead
over Cole and Sheri.

26:54.501 --> 26:56.180
So, I think this street down here.

26:56.181 --> 26:57.220
You think this is it?

26:57.221 --> 26:59.340
This has got to be it, Mom.

26:59.341 --> 27:02.500
Yeah, Mom, that's them.
That's them. Come on.

27:02.501 --> 27:04.220
Uniform. Yeah, uniform.

27:04.221 --> 27:05.700
We've got to go in
and get our clothes, baby.

27:05.701 --> 27:08.620
I don't think anyone else showed up
here, which I don't know why.

27:08.621 --> 27:10.020
It's runtime.

27:10.021 --> 27:12.380
Yeah. We've got to run.
Let's see who is working in here.

27:12.381 --> 27:15.220
OK, these are the only guys working.
You're the only guys working?

27:15.221 --> 27:16.820
Yeah, I don't know.
We didn't see the dancers.

27:16.821 --> 27:18.820
Did you do it or no?
-OK. No. Do you mean...

27:18.821 --> 27:21.100
The scooters was impossible.
-We tried the scooters, it was crazy.

27:21.101 --> 27:22.900
Well, it wasn't impossible,
we just couldn't do it.

27:22.901 --> 27:24.740
OK, whatever.

27:24.741 --> 27:27.300
OK. Like we can't ask them
'cause they won't tell us the truth.

27:27.301 --> 27:29.660
We're not going to get freaked out.
He said the scooters are impossible.

27:29.661 --> 27:31.260
He tried the scooters.

27:31.261 --> 27:32.461
That's what he just said.

27:33.661 --> 27:34.700
Look how good we look.

27:34.701 --> 27:36.860
SHERI: We looked good.
-COLE: We looked good in a suit.

27:36.861 --> 27:38.180
It was cool, it was like James Bond.

27:38.181 --> 27:40.100
I don't know why anyone chose
to hang paintings.

27:40.101 --> 27:41.700
Easy choice.

27:41.701 --> 27:42.701
I'm pretty athletic.

27:42.702 --> 27:45.340
I can skateboard and skimboard,

27:45.341 --> 27:46.780
so I'm like, "Ah, let's do this.

27:46.781 --> 27:49.900
"Mum, I know it might be tough for
you, but I'll help you through it."

27:49.901 --> 27:52.341
And we get there
and I instantly regret it.

27:53.421 --> 27:54.980
Oh. Oh, man.

27:54.981 --> 27:57.380
Can you hold my hand the whole way?
(LAUGHS)

27:57.381 --> 27:58.541
Oh.

27:59.501 --> 28:01.180
Hey, Mom, you push your...

28:01.181 --> 28:03.380
Whoa! Mom. What?

28:03.381 --> 28:05.980
(LAUGHS)

28:05.981 --> 28:07.580
My mom's riding...

28:07.581 --> 28:09.500
..a good bit better than I am.

28:09.501 --> 28:11.940
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

28:11.941 --> 28:14.780
Uh, I know I look cool with these
two guys holding me,

28:14.781 --> 28:15.980
it's like training wheels.

28:15.981 --> 28:18.140
My future girlfriend is going
to see this and think,

28:18.141 --> 28:20.260
"Wow, Cole looks so cool."

28:20.261 --> 28:22.340
Whoa...

28:22.341 --> 28:23.780
Oh. It's so difficult.

28:23.781 --> 28:25.460
How do they do it with such ease?

28:25.461 --> 28:27.940
I know, it's crazy, isn't it, Cole?

28:27.941 --> 28:29.220
They just, like, hop on it.

28:29.221 --> 28:30.981
I thought it was going to be
a little easier.

28:32.381 --> 28:33.381
It's not.

28:35.661 --> 28:37.260
Outdoor painters.
Here we go, here we go.

28:37.261 --> 28:38.860
Here we go. Oh, my gosh.

28:38.861 --> 28:40.420
Find the dude
with a marked paintbrush.

28:40.421 --> 28:41.500
Marked paintbrush.

28:41.501 --> 28:42.540
There he is right there.

28:42.541 --> 28:44.220
Do you have some paintings for us?

28:44.221 --> 28:45.540
OK.

28:45.541 --> 28:46.861
We can get this done fast.

28:48.741 --> 28:51.740
We are a few screws away.

28:51.741 --> 28:54.940
Or we're a few screws loose.
You tell us.

28:54.941 --> 28:56.540
Left side needs to go higher.

28:56.541 --> 28:57.620
A tiny smidgin.

28:57.621 --> 28:59.340
Up? A smidgin, eh?

28:59.341 --> 29:00.860
A smidgin.

29:00.861 --> 29:02.500
A smidgin is a very technical term

29:02.501 --> 29:04.500
when you are in
the carpentry business.

29:04.501 --> 29:07.221
It's just like the tiniest
itiest bitiest little bit.

29:10.621 --> 29:12.060
That is a smidgin.

29:12.061 --> 29:14.740
Ta-dah! A smidgin is born.

29:14.741 --> 29:16.300
Bingo!
-Bingo!

29:16.301 --> 29:18.380
I have my degree in smidgins.

29:18.381 --> 29:20.220
OK, want to present?

29:20.221 --> 29:21.821
Yeah, may as well try.
Can we see?

29:23.061 --> 29:25.780
I think it looks great.
-I think it looks beautiful.

29:25.781 --> 29:28.500
It's so pretty. It's so good.

29:28.501 --> 29:30.220
Yeah.
-OK.

29:30.221 --> 29:32.260
Yeah!

29:32.261 --> 29:34.380
Oh, my God! Thank you so much.
-Are you serious?

29:34.381 --> 29:36.180
Oh, my God. Korey!

29:36.181 --> 29:38.620
Are you serious?
-Here, open it.

29:38.621 --> 29:40.500
Oh, my God, it's a picture.

29:40.501 --> 29:43.980
<i>This enormous roofline is meant
to represent the wingspan</i>

29:43.981 --> 29:45.420
<i>of an ancient mythical bird.</i>

29:45.421 --> 29:48.460
Stretching more than five football
fields long,

29:48.461 --> 29:50.900
this impressive structure
in the heart of the city

29:50.901 --> 29:53.540
<i>shadows Shenzhen's Library Terrace.</i>

29:53.541 --> 29:55.500
The Pit Stop for this leg
of the race.

29:55.501 --> 29:58.260
<i>The last team to check-in
will be eliminated.</i>

29:58.261 --> 30:01.741
Oh, my God!
-Korey, let's just get out of here.

30:04.501 --> 30:06.100
I think it looks frigging perfect.

30:06.101 --> 30:07.660
I mean, it does fit now.

30:07.661 --> 30:10.220
It fits and it goes across.

30:10.221 --> 30:11.260
Oh, this is fine.

30:11.261 --> 30:12.861
It looks perfect.

30:15.261 --> 30:17.340
Yes! Whoo!

30:17.341 --> 30:18.740
Thank you so much.
-Thank you so much.

30:18.741 --> 30:20.541
I think this is where we're going.

30:23.341 --> 30:24.740
Anybody know this area
and speak English?

30:24.741 --> 30:26.020
Anybody know the addresses?

30:26.021 --> 30:27.780
You don't know?
You don't speak English? OK.

30:27.781 --> 30:31.020
Wow. We've got to find
this art gallery.

30:31.021 --> 30:32.021
Let's hurry.

30:32.022 --> 30:33.700
Ah!

30:33.701 --> 30:35.460
Oh, gosh. I'm about to fall.

30:35.461 --> 30:38.060
Mom, this is difficult.
-I know.

30:38.061 --> 30:39.940
Do you think we can get it?

30:39.941 --> 30:40.941
What do you think?

30:40.942 --> 30:42.300
Do you feel like
you're getting better?

30:42.301 --> 30:44.180
I'm definitely getting better.
-OK.

30:44.181 --> 30:45.620
Do you think that
you're getting better?

30:45.621 --> 30:46.621
I'm getting better.

30:46.622 --> 30:47.780
Do you think we'll be able
to get it?

30:47.781 --> 30:48.820
The other teams aren't here.

30:48.821 --> 30:51.060
If they're at the painting thing
they're already so far ahead

30:51.061 --> 30:52.540
it'd make no sense
to go to the painting.

30:52.541 --> 30:54.260
I agree.
-They'd finish it before us.

30:54.261 --> 30:55.980
These are heavy as hell.

30:55.981 --> 30:58.620
Tyler,
let's go be in the final three.

30:58.621 --> 31:00.180
Oh, there they are.

31:00.181 --> 31:01.260
Oh, we're ahead of them.

31:01.261 --> 31:02.540
They finished. Dammit!

31:02.541 --> 31:04.140
Well, there goes first.

31:04.141 --> 31:06.180
There goes first. There goes first.

31:06.181 --> 31:08.300
There you go, Momma,
you're really good.

31:08.301 --> 31:09.580
We're not fighting for first
anymore.

31:09.581 --> 31:10.901
No, we're fighting to stay in it.

31:15.685 --> 31:17.524
That's it? Down there?

31:17.525 --> 31:18.564
Thank you.

31:18.565 --> 31:19.565
Alright.
-Oh, thank God.

31:19.566 --> 31:20.964
OK, go that way, sweetie.

31:20.965 --> 31:22.844
That's it. That's it. That's it.

31:22.845 --> 31:25.725
This one should be easier.
-This one should be a lot easier.

31:27.245 --> 31:29.124
I feel like I'm maybe doing better.

31:29.125 --> 31:30.684
I'm just hoping that we made
the right decision

31:30.685 --> 31:32.884
'cause it's going to be
very difficult to do on our own.

31:32.885 --> 31:34.084
You got it, Mom.

31:34.085 --> 31:35.604
Now I just got to get it.

31:35.605 --> 31:37.285
This one's it.

31:42.725 --> 31:44.524
Not that one.

31:44.525 --> 31:46.964
I'm so glad we didn't do
the unicycle.

31:46.965 --> 31:49.724
The painting was a little bit
more challenging than we expected.

31:49.725 --> 31:50.725
Yeah.

31:50.726 --> 31:53.444
Hopefully that really trips up
Burnie & Ashley

31:53.445 --> 31:56.164
and maybe even gives Sheri and Cole
a chance

31:56.165 --> 31:58.884
to be some comeback kids today.
-Yeah.

31:58.885 --> 32:03.085
I just want to see Phil
and hear any number less than four.

32:05.605 --> 32:08.884
Now, here's a weird question that
we haven't taken into account yet.

32:08.885 --> 32:10.564
Are these supposed to have like
a pattern

32:10.565 --> 32:11.764
that goes all the way through them?

32:11.765 --> 32:14.124
That could be possible.
We should look at that.

32:14.125 --> 32:18.004
Er... I'm going to say
this is a no on the top.

32:18.005 --> 32:19.844
That one doesn't seem to match.
This one's upside down.

32:19.845 --> 32:21.924
I'm glad you noticed
the patterns early

32:21.925 --> 32:23.244
before we put too many nails in.

32:23.245 --> 32:25.044
We might have hung
the wrong one for the top

32:25.045 --> 32:28.364
but at least we've discovered
this problem very early

32:28.365 --> 32:30.285
when we've only had
one painting hung. OK.

32:31.605 --> 32:34.285
(SIGHS HEAVILY)
It's starting to rain.

32:38.165 --> 32:40.564
The hardest part now
because it's so wet out here

32:40.565 --> 32:42.846
whenever I start leaning forward,
I kind of start sliding.

32:43.845 --> 32:45.524
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

32:45.525 --> 32:47.044
I want it to be maybe
I can learn it first

32:47.045 --> 32:49.684
so if they put us behind
in the challenge.

32:49.685 --> 32:51.884
Hey, I got it all by myself.

32:51.885 --> 32:54.484
You're doing good, Mom.
You got it, Mom.

32:54.485 --> 32:56.044
(LAUGHS)

32:56.045 --> 32:58.565
My mom was better at it than me,
yeah.

33:01.365 --> 33:04.604
I was getting so frustrated,
you know, 'cause I'm competitive.

33:04.605 --> 33:06.204
I'm like, "Why can't I do this?"

33:06.205 --> 33:07.284
And then I look over...

33:07.285 --> 33:10.125
(GIGGLES)
-Are you kidding me?

33:11.525 --> 33:14.005
I'm wondering if I should practice
holding a suitcase?

33:16.525 --> 33:17.764
How are you doing
with the briefcase?

33:17.765 --> 33:19.084
It's harder.

33:19.085 --> 33:21.884
A lot harder?
-The rain has not made it any easier.

33:21.885 --> 33:23.524
I mean, I don't think
that we should switch.

33:23.525 --> 33:24.764
No, no, we're in it.

33:24.765 --> 33:27.085
This is what we're going to do.
This is it.

33:30.125 --> 33:31.604
Ready?
-Yeah.

33:31.605 --> 33:33.164
Ty, do you think this is the front?
-Yeah.

33:33.165 --> 33:34.444
Right, let's go.

33:34.445 --> 33:35.564
OK, it's good.

33:35.565 --> 33:38.284
OK, thank you.
-<i>Xie xie</i>.

33:38.285 --> 33:39.564
Thank you so much.

33:39.565 --> 33:41.644
This is it. It's...

33:41.645 --> 33:43.084
Is it inside?

33:43.085 --> 33:44.164
This is the terrace.

33:44.165 --> 33:46.844
This is
the Shenzhen Industrial Museum.

33:46.845 --> 33:48.924
Let's go back.
-OK.

33:48.925 --> 33:51.965
Could it be out front there...
with the view of this?

33:53.285 --> 33:55.644
Come on, find him, baby.
-(GROANS)

33:55.645 --> 33:58.844
Damn, where is it?
-This is the Pit Stop?

33:58.845 --> 34:00.804
Shenzhen Industrial Museum.

34:00.805 --> 34:03.044
This is the industrial museum.

34:03.045 --> 34:04.444
We have to find the library.

34:04.445 --> 34:06.964
Yes, Korey, yes.

34:06.965 --> 34:08.884
I see steps.
-Yeah, up those steps, I think.

34:08.885 --> 34:09.885
OK.

34:16.005 --> 34:18.405
Ah, I see him! Phil, we're coming!

34:22.844 --> 34:24.045
Come on!

34:25.525 --> 34:26.685
Phil!

34:29.965 --> 34:31.563
Welcome to Shenzhen, China.

34:31.565 --> 34:34.594
We're happy to be here.
-Check them out. Check it out.

34:34.594 --> 34:36.074
(GASPS)

34:38.324 --> 34:39.324
Wow!

34:39.326 --> 34:41.684
Tyler and Korey, you guys should be
singing in the rain.

34:41.685 --> 34:43.043
You are team number one!

34:43.045 --> 34:44.244
BOTH: Yes!

34:44.245 --> 34:46.444
And you are one of the three teams

34:46.445 --> 34:52.074
who will be racing back
to the United States for $1 million.

34:52.074 --> 34:54.043
Congratulations!
-Oh, Phil!

34:54.045 --> 34:57.364
Awesome job! Awesome job!
It's got to be a dream come true.

34:57.365 --> 35:00.404
I didn't foresee any other outcome
than us winning.

35:00.405 --> 35:02.044
Now it's like we can taste it.

35:02.045 --> 35:04.444
Going into the finals
with five wins,

35:04.445 --> 35:06.764
I feel like we have had the training

35:06.765 --> 35:10.839
to do what it takes
to take home that final last first.

35:14.646 --> 35:16.205
I hear something.

35:16.206 --> 35:17.845
Go up there.

35:17.846 --> 35:20.475
I told you this is where
the library was.

35:20.476 --> 35:22.475
Whoa!

35:22.476 --> 35:24.046
It's here, come on.
-(LAUGHTER)

35:33.246 --> 35:36.435
Dana and Matt, I'm pleased to tell
you that you are team number two

35:36.436 --> 35:40.435
and you are one of the teams that
will be racing to the finish line

35:40.436 --> 35:43.165
for $1 million,
along with Tyler and Korey.

35:43.166 --> 35:44.805
Congratulations!

35:44.806 --> 35:47.125
Oh, my God.
We've got to get this one.

35:47.126 --> 35:49.436
Oh, come on.
(BANGING)

35:51.926 --> 35:53.885
Here we go again.
-Here we go again.

35:53.886 --> 35:56.285
No big whoop.

35:56.286 --> 35:58.045
Oh, sweet. OK.

35:58.046 --> 36:00.526
Would you like to take a look?

36:02.566 --> 36:04.765
OK.

36:04.766 --> 36:06.995
Please, please, please,
please, please, please, please.

36:06.996 --> 36:08.125
That's good there.

36:08.126 --> 36:09.365
That worked.

36:09.366 --> 36:10.845
Very good.
-Yay!

36:10.846 --> 36:12.125
Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

36:12.126 --> 36:14.995
Shenzhen Library terrace.
-OK.

36:14.996 --> 36:17.435
I wish we knew what happened
to Cole and Sheri.

36:17.436 --> 36:21.165
Are you kidding me?
Gosh, we've got to manoeuvre...

36:21.166 --> 36:23.765
These people need to be moving
out of the way (LAUGHS).

36:23.766 --> 36:26.765
They'd better manoeuvre away from us
or I'm ploughing into them.

36:26.766 --> 36:28.605
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!

36:28.606 --> 36:30.436
Move! Move! Move! Move!

36:31.526 --> 36:32.955
We don't have to stay up
the whole time

36:32.956 --> 36:34.925
but we have to stay close together.

36:34.926 --> 36:37.205
Go!
You go ahead and pass me.

36:37.206 --> 36:40.366
Alright, come on, Cole.
You got it. You got it. Come on!

36:41.526 --> 36:43.435
Go, Cole!

36:43.436 --> 36:45.205
Oh, crap!

36:45.206 --> 36:46.245
Sorry, Mom.

36:46.246 --> 36:48.435
Baby, you have waited on me
many a time.

36:48.436 --> 36:50.845
I'm coming. I'm right behind you.

36:50.846 --> 36:52.165
I'm sorry.

36:52.166 --> 36:54.246
Watch out! Watch out! Watch out!
Watch out!

36:56.606 --> 36:57.926
Oh, my God!

37:00.366 --> 37:03.405
It's nerve wracking not to know
where the other teams are

37:03.406 --> 37:05.285
because it means that we don't know
where we stand.

37:05.286 --> 37:07.525
We threw away
a bunch of time on the unicycles.

37:07.526 --> 37:09.125
We did.

37:09.126 --> 37:10.845
You're doing a great job, Cole!

37:10.846 --> 37:12.086
Whoa!

37:16.126 --> 37:19.165
Stay on! Stay on! Stay on!

37:19.166 --> 37:20.845
Stay on, I'm coming!

37:20.846 --> 37:22.605
Mom, are you still good?

37:22.606 --> 37:24.125
How in the world are there cars

37:24.126 --> 37:25.725
on the road that we're supposed
to be driving on?

37:25.726 --> 37:27.955
(CAR HORNS)
-OK, now what?

37:27.956 --> 37:29.645
Are we supposed to squeeze through
these cars?

37:29.646 --> 37:30.995
Are you ready?
Yes.

37:30.996 --> 37:32.086
OK.

37:34.726 --> 37:36.565
No! No! No! No, sir.

37:36.566 --> 37:38.325
No, please. Thank you, thank you.

37:38.326 --> 37:39.996
Yeah!

37:41.126 --> 37:43.565
Yeah!
Oh, God!

37:43.566 --> 37:45.925
Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero...

37:45.926 --> 37:47.125
Zero.
-Zero, zero...

37:47.126 --> 37:50.205
Six zeros. Yeah.

37:50.206 --> 37:52.045
Shenzhen Library terrace.

37:52.046 --> 37:54.885
Is that where we've got to go?
-Yeah, that's where we've got to go.

37:54.886 --> 37:57.605
Let's just hope the other one
was super hard.

37:57.606 --> 37:59.845
There's no way the other one
was any longer than this one.

37:59.846 --> 38:02.885
We are almost at the Pit Stop
and we will finally get to the mat

38:02.886 --> 38:04.925
and find out what our fate is.

38:04.926 --> 38:07.565
We're hoping we're in third,
we're hoping we're in second

38:07.566 --> 38:09.605
but we don't know and we won't know
until we get to the mat.

38:09.606 --> 38:11.605
We've already chosen
the funnest Detour.

38:11.606 --> 38:12.925
Ah-huh.
-Think about it,

38:12.926 --> 38:14.245
every time we chose
the funnest Detour

38:14.246 --> 38:16.085
and we thought we were out,
what happened?

38:16.086 --> 38:17.126
We didn't go out.

38:18.766 --> 38:22.406
I think somehow we're in it.

38:26.166 --> 38:28.605
That's not good. We're going to have
to get out and run.

38:28.606 --> 38:30.685
Are you sure?
-No, I'm not.

38:30.686 --> 38:32.245
But look at the street,
there's no movement.

38:32.246 --> 38:33.766
I see it.

38:34.886 --> 38:36.435
We have to find the library terrace.
-OK.

38:36.436 --> 38:37.805
I regret nothing.

38:37.806 --> 38:40.925
I guarantee we had so much more fun
than everyone who did the paintings.

38:40.926 --> 38:44.325
Except for the fact that one of them
is going to win $1 million.

38:44.326 --> 38:46.245
Except for the fact that one of them
will be millionaires.

38:46.246 --> 38:48.165
Is about to be crazy rich.

38:48.166 --> 38:50.165
Is that it? That's it.
-That's it.

38:50.166 --> 38:53.765
We're close. Where is Phil?

38:53.766 --> 38:57.475
We know we're in the right area,
we just can't see him anywhere.

38:57.476 --> 38:59.685
OK, it says library to the right.

38:59.686 --> 39:02.605
Is this it? Up here? OK.
-I hear sounds.

39:02.606 --> 39:03.845
Oh, up there.

39:03.846 --> 39:06.475
Where is this damn Pit Stop?

39:06.476 --> 39:07.725
It's got to be this way.

39:07.726 --> 39:09.525
Wait, do you think this way
or this way?

39:09.526 --> 39:11.285
Which way do you want to go?

39:11.286 --> 39:13.475
You want to go that way?
-You think this way and up?

39:13.476 --> 39:14.476
Yeah.

39:14.477 --> 39:16.085
Oh, my God.
-Oh, my God.

39:16.086 --> 39:17.435
Who's it going to be?

39:17.436 --> 39:19.325
Anybody could be catching up
at this point.

39:19.326 --> 39:21.475
Everyone's got to be having this
amount of trouble finding Phil,

39:21.476 --> 39:22.525
I would think.

39:22.526 --> 39:25.405
Come on, Mom!
I really hope this is the way.

39:25.406 --> 39:26.925
This is it.

39:26.926 --> 39:28.405
Don't change your smile.

39:28.406 --> 39:29.525
Are we going to the right place?

39:29.526 --> 39:30.925
Yeah!

39:30.926 --> 39:33.605
I think it's going to be yellow.

39:33.606 --> 39:36.606
(SHOUTING AND LAUGHTER)

39:39.206 --> 39:41.525
Where's Burnie and Ashley?

39:41.526 --> 39:42.886
Are we third?

39:44.086 --> 39:46.565
No! Mom, we're third!

39:46.566 --> 39:49.646
No! No!

39:51.326 --> 39:54.405
No!
-Yes!

39:54.406 --> 39:56.366
We knew we were last.

39:57.436 --> 39:58.885
You made it!

39:58.886 --> 40:01.725
Oh, my God!

40:01.726 --> 40:04.166
We were riding those unicycles
for like three years.

40:05.476 --> 40:06.805
Where are they?

40:06.806 --> 40:08.475
We don't know!
-We don't know!

40:08.476 --> 40:10.725
Sheri and Cole,
I'm pleased to tell you

40:10.726 --> 40:12.805
that you are one of the three teams

40:12.806 --> 40:15.045
who will be racing
with these two teams

40:15.046 --> 40:17.925
to the finish line for $1 million.

40:17.926 --> 40:19.845
Congratulations!

40:19.846 --> 40:22.645
Hey, baby, we made it.

40:22.646 --> 40:24.205
I don't see anybody else.

40:24.206 --> 40:27.925
We might be... We might be in first!

40:27.926 --> 40:29.475
Hey, I just want you to know,

40:29.476 --> 40:31.285
no matter what we get up there
at the top of the stairs,

40:31.286 --> 40:32.525
I love you very much.
-I love you.

40:32.526 --> 40:34.325
Sheri and Cole are right there.

40:34.326 --> 40:35.365
Damn.

40:35.366 --> 40:37.686
I love you, baby.
-I love you.

40:38.726 --> 40:40.126
Good job.

40:41.526 --> 40:42.565
Good job, guys.

40:42.566 --> 40:43.955
Burnie and Ashley.
Yeah.

40:43.956 --> 40:47.475
Unfortunately you can see that all
the other teams have checked in.

40:47.476 --> 40:49.325
You are the last team to arrive

40:49.326 --> 40:52.646
and only three teams will be racing
to the finish line.

40:55.846 --> 40:58.605
It is enormously disappointing
to not make it

40:58.606 --> 41:02.525
to the final final leg
of The Amazing Race.

41:02.526 --> 41:04.845
We just had a classic bad day
on the race

41:04.846 --> 41:07.205
and you can't do that
this late in the game.

41:07.206 --> 41:09.435
Going into the finals
with five wins,

41:09.436 --> 41:13.955
we're confident, strong and we're
ready to do whatever it takes.

41:13.956 --> 41:17.405
I think that we're absolutely
capable of winning.

41:17.406 --> 41:19.996
We proved on the very first leg
that we had the potential.

41:21.366 --> 41:24.245
We may not be the most physically
strong or the smartest team.

41:24.246 --> 41:26.165
Yeah, Mama!
We've got heart.

41:26.166 --> 41:29.435
Sheri and Cole, they still
look at themselves as underdogs.

41:29.436 --> 41:30.605
You're still in the race.

41:30.606 --> 41:32.885
This is a non-elimination leg.

41:32.886 --> 41:33.995
Matt and Dana...

41:33.996 --> 41:36.165
We have three...
-..they bicker a good bit

41:36.166 --> 41:38.085
and that could be to their downside.

41:38.086 --> 41:39.725
I'm at a disadvantage with my height

41:39.726 --> 41:41.885
and also my partner's
lack of communication.

41:41.886 --> 41:43.605
We've had some bumpy legs

41:43.606 --> 41:46.605
but we feel like we've been getting
stronger as the legs progress.

41:46.606 --> 41:48.525
It's our turn for a first.

41:48.526 --> 41:52.475
I never want to count the chickens
before they hatch

41:52.476 --> 41:54.885
but I genuinely feel like
we're going to win this.

41:54.886 --> 41:57.045
No-one sees us coming, we suck,

41:57.046 --> 41:59.405
we're in last place
but somehow we stay in it

41:59.406 --> 42:01.845
and then at the last minute
we snake bite that million dollars.

42:01.846 --> 42:03.285
Yay!
-You never know.

42:03.286 --> 42:07.122
Anything can happen with this show,
it's crazy. Argh! Boom!

42:36.755 --> 42:39.154
Stop!
