00:00.300 --> 00:03.467
Jesse, you know,
that's really sweet

00:03.467 --> 00:06.233
but I kinda make it a thing
not to date guys in my band.

00:06.233 --> 00:08.100
I forgot to tell you.

00:08.100 --> 00:09.800
I'm dating Jake Ryan.

00:09.800 --> 00:11.934
Look at that little puppy.

00:11.934 --> 00:14.934
Let's get you away
from that miserable punk

00:14.934 --> 00:16.867
who broke my
daughter's heart.

00:18.200 --> 00:20.500
Hey, listen, man, I don't
like the way you treat "chicks."

00:20.500 --> 00:23.300
- But...
- And I hate the fact that you
keep interrupting me.

00:23.300 --> 00:24.767
Hey, hey, wait, I got it!

00:24.767 --> 00:27.700
OK, after rehearsal, you get
Jesse to ask you out,

00:27.700 --> 00:29.100
making sure your dad can hear.

00:29.100 --> 00:31.467
See, Hannah likes a boy
that I don't like.

00:31.467 --> 00:33.667
And she knows I don't like you.

00:33.667 --> 00:36.400
So she's asking you out hoping
that I don't like you

00:36.400 --> 00:39.367
more than the boy that I
don't like that she does like.

00:40.700 --> 00:44.467
- I really like you.
- What?

00:46.400 --> 00:47.500
Don't worry about it.

00:47.500 --> 00:50.467
I am a big boy,
and I will get over it.

00:51.867 --> 00:55.367
Besides, it's pretty obvious
you're way into this other guy.

00:55.367 --> 00:56.934
I am.

00:56.934 --> 01:01.300
Well, he's very lucky
and I hope he knows it.

01:01.300 --> 01:03.600
Thanks.

01:03.600 --> 01:06.900
I mean, I kinda think
that he could be the one.

01:06.900 --> 01:10.567
Hm. It's a good line
for a song.

01:10.567 --> 01:11.900
I mean, I'd lose
the whole "kinda" part.

01:11.900 --> 01:14.367
Makes you sound a little
"one foot in, one foot out."

01:15.734 --> 01:17.100
Yeah.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.100

- Oh, really?
- Yeah, I wouldn't wanna...
[coughs]

...kiss you and then sneeze
on you and get you all Jesse...
messy.

04:18.400 --> 04:23.667
Get you all messy. Yeah, and get
you sick, too. Whoo, we would
not want that.

04:23.667 --> 04:26.667
- I think it's worth the risk.
- Not me.

Yeah, not me, because I care

04:35.967 --> 04:40.200

is what I used to say to my dad
when I was little.

'Cause my dad's
a guitar player.

04:42.467 --> 04:46.500
Yeah. Whoo!
Yep, that's a fever. [sighing]

04:46.500 --> 04:49.934
Hey, well, you get
some rest and feel better

04:49.934 --> 04:53.100
and know that I'm thinking
about you every minute until
I see you again.

04:53.100 --> 04:57.033
And when I fall asleep,
I'm gonna dream about you.

04:57.033 --> 04:58.467
Are you gonna dream about me?

04:58.467 --> 05:00.734
I sure hope so.

05:02.400 --> 05:06.934
But you know dreams, they're
uncontrollable little suckers.

05:06.934 --> 05:09.867
- Yeah.
- Can't control what just
pops into your head.

be a sandwich, I mean,

05:12.800 --> 05:17.100

- Lilly, it's me. You've gotta
get over here right now!

- [gasping]
- Yeah, Miley, I'm a little
busy right now.

05:28.734 --> 05:31.367
- Pulling, pulling, pulling!
- Sorry, I'm sorry!

05:31.367 --> 05:32.934
Oliver's got this
big knot in his hair

05:32.934 --> 05:34.600
and I'm trying to
get it out without...

05:34.600 --> 05:38.033
- [whimpering] Hurting,
hurting me!
- Sorry, honey.

05:38.033 --> 05:40.500
Lilly, I mean it.
Right now. It's code red!

05:40.500 --> 05:43.100
- [crashing noise]
- Code red.

05:43.100 --> 05:45.867
[panting]
Why didn't you say so?

05:45.867 --> 05:48.200
Man, you weren't kiddin'
about that knot.

05:51.767 --> 05:54.667
And he thought I
couldn't get it out.

05:54.667 --> 05:56.834
[screeching] Ahh!

06:00.867 --> 06:02.967
Oh my gosh, you're
in love with Jesse?

06:02.967 --> 06:08.200
- I'm not in love with Jesse.
- And yet you're seeing his head
on Jake's body. Interesting.

06:09.033 --> 06:10.567
OK, fine!

06:10.567 --> 06:14.133
I'm a little bit attracted
to him, but I can control it,

06:14.133 --> 06:17.200
because I'm not gonna let this
ruin what I have with Jake.

06:17.200 --> 06:18.900
We have such history.

06:18.900 --> 06:22.834
We have way too much history
to throw it away on some
intense,

06:22.834 --> 06:27.600
brooding, passionate, strong...

06:29.200 --> 06:32.100
- ...yet sensitive guy...
- Miley.

06:32.100 --> 06:38.000

that move you like the moon
with the tide.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.967
You know, a dance
as old as time itself.

06:41.967 --> 06:44.767
Well, as long as you
can control it.

06:44.767 --> 06:49.000
Control what?
Oh, boy.

06:49.000 --> 06:54.600
Whoo! Nothing like a two mile
run to make a man feel at one
with the world.

06:54.600 --> 06:58.300
Great. Must be nice to be you.

06:58.300 --> 07:02.567
Well, hello to you,
little miss mood swing.

07:02.567 --> 07:06.133

now that everything's in
the open with you and Jake.

07:06.133 --> 07:10.767
I am happy. I'm thrilled!
[laughing]

07:10.767 --> 07:12.734

07:14.567 --> 07:18.000
Right, yeah. Happy.
Never seen her happier.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.500
Is that the face of
a happy girl, or what?

07:21.700 --> 07:23.834
OK, then, uh...

07:23.834 --> 07:27.233
You should be excited to know
that I was thinking about
inviting Jake over for dinner

07:27.233 --> 07:29.400
so he and I can get to know
each other a little better.

07:29.400 --> 07:33.033
Yeah, that sounds
like a great idea,

07:33.033 --> 07:36.667
having Jake over for dinner
'cause he's my boyfriend.

07:36.667 --> 07:40.233

07:40.233 --> 07:42.767

Sweet niblet. Honey, what
I'm trying to say is, uh,

07:48.100 --> 07:52.100
you and I need a little code
word for when you're dealin'
with these, uh,

07:52.100 --> 07:53.400

08:03.033 --> 08:08.200
Daddy, the walrus
sings at midnight.

08:10.100 --> 08:12.934
I get it. I get it, uh...
I might go for another run,

08:12.934 --> 08:17.367

with the world, you know? Whoo!

12:18.900 --> 12:21.233
How many times have you
used that one before?

12:22.567 --> 12:24.500
OK, a lot.

12:25.734 --> 12:28.133
But this time I mean it.

12:28.133 --> 12:31.300
It's different with you.
I can't get you out of my head.

12:32.500 --> 12:34.967
Your laugh,

12:34.967 --> 12:38.834
the way you lose
yourself in a song,

12:38.834 --> 12:40.667
the way you love life.

12:43.467 --> 12:45.233
Just say no if
you want me to stop.

12:45.233 --> 12:49.200
[stammering] No! No. No.

12:49.200 --> 12:53.133
See, I can't do this, because
uh, I mean I want to kiss you.

12:54.367 --> 12:57.700
You have no idea how
much I wanna kiss you.

12:58.667 --> 13:00.600
Boy, do I wanna kiss you.

13:00.600 --> 13:02.400
You wanna what?

13:03.800 --> 13:07.000
Jakeee! I was just
writing a song for you!

13:07.000 --> 13:08.734
<i>♪ You have no idea how much</i>
<i>I wanna kiss you ♪</i>

13:08.734 --> 13:10.967
<i>♪ My Jakee wakee baby</i>
<i>yeah yeah ♪</i>

13:10.967 --> 13:13.300
Let's go!
Isn't that right, Jesse?

13:13.300 --> 13:16.900
- What?
- Yeah, I don't
believe it either.

13:16.900 --> 13:19.233
Look, nothing happened and
nothing was going to happen.

13:19.233 --> 13:22.667
- But you wanted it to.
- One problem at a time, please!

13:22.667 --> 13:24.700
Look, you know how
I feel about you, Jake.

13:24.700 --> 13:28.033
I thought I did.
Now I'm not so sure.

13:28.033 --> 13:29.667
When you figure it out,
let me know.

13:31.800 --> 13:32.900
Me, too.

13:34.200 --> 13:38.000
But for what it's worth,
I wanted to kiss you, too.

13:42.467 --> 13:46.500
Wow. Go to the bathroom,
you just miss everything.

13:55.700 --> 13:57.767
Hey, Miles, we got here
as fast as we could.

13:57.767 --> 14:01.133
Yeah, we would've been here
sooner, but somebody thought
"code red" meant

14:01.133 --> 14:04.100
"stop and get frozen yogurt
on the way to Miley's."

14:04.100 --> 14:08.233
Ah, that's funny. Don't remember
this bothering you when you were
eating most of it!

14:08.233 --> 14:09.233
Hey!

14:10.200 --> 14:13.200
Oh, how selfish am I?

14:13.200 --> 14:16.233
I mean, my life is
practically falling apart,

14:16.233 --> 14:20.000
but I'm interrupting
a yogurt crisis!

14:20.000 --> 14:22.100
Sorry, OK, we're here for you.

14:22.100 --> 14:24.367
OK, so what's the deal?

14:24.367 --> 14:27.133
Both of these guys are just
waiting for you to make up
your mind?

14:27.133 --> 14:29.767
- Yeah.
- Man.

14:29.767 --> 14:33.033
I gotta tell you, Miley. If I
found out Lilly was torn between
me and another guy,

14:33.033 --> 14:36.300
- dude, I would walk right up to
her and I would say...
- What?

14:36.300 --> 14:38.667
You would say what?

14:38.667 --> 14:40.300
You take all the time
you need, sweetheart.

14:40.300 --> 14:42.700
I live for you, only you, and
would you like a foot massage?

14:42.700 --> 14:46.567
Aww! See?
This is why I love you,

14:46.567 --> 14:49.600
and why I would never even think
of looking at another guy

14:49.600 --> 14:52.367
because I am a one guy
kind of girl, you know?

14:52.367 --> 14:54.734
I don't go buzzing around
like some little queen bee

14:54.734 --> 14:57.200
from one little pretty flower
to the next pretty flower...

14:57.200 --> 14:59.233
...but that's just me.

14:59.233 --> 15:01.000
You know, I don't
make any judgments.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.400
Oh, look at the time,
we're late!

15:05.567 --> 15:06.900
Late for what?
We just got here.

15:06.900 --> 15:09.200
- We're just late, OK?
- OK.

15:12.600 --> 15:15.300
Man, this is just so hard.

15:15.300 --> 15:16.400
I mean, you...

15:16.400 --> 15:18.400
...we have so much history.

15:18.400 --> 15:21.867
I mean, I loved you,
then I couldn't stand you,

15:21.867 --> 15:24.600
then I loved you, then I
couldn't stand you again,

15:24.600 --> 15:26.900
and then you did the whole
"gotcha" thing, and

15:26.900 --> 15:30.500
then we kissed and... ugh!

15:30.500 --> 15:31.667
And you, I mean...

15:31.667 --> 15:34.967
Jesse, we have no history,

15:34.967 --> 15:37.467
but when we were writing
that song, I mean,

15:37.467 --> 15:42.367
something clicked and then
you said all those incredibly
sweet things

15:42.367 --> 15:46.700
and then we almost kissed
which brings me back to ugh!

15:46.700 --> 15:48.934
Why do you have
to be so wonderful?

15:48.934 --> 15:52.200
Why can't you guys just
do the honorable thing
and stink? Ugh!

15:52.200 --> 15:54.867
- [Jesse] Hey, watch it!
- [Jake] Not the face,
not the face!

15:54.867 --> 15:57.734
What do you see
in this guy anyway?

15:57.734 --> 16:03.300
Ooh, real macho movie star,
are ya? "Not the face,
not the face!"

16:05.900 --> 16:08.300
Come on, I know you
had thing with him,

16:08.300 --> 16:10.567
but that doesn't mean you have
to stay with him out of guilt.

16:10.567 --> 16:14.900
Guilt? She loves me, not you.

16:14.900 --> 16:20.000
I think you mean "loved,"
as in "the past."

16:20.000 --> 16:23.834
As in "that was then,"
and this is "Jesse time."

16:23.834 --> 16:26.967
- Jake time.
- Jesse time.

16:26.967 --> 16:29.000
- Jake.
- Jesse.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.200
- Jake!
- Jesse!

16:30.200 --> 16:31.467
- Jake!
- Jesse!

16:31.467 --> 16:32.600
- Jake!
- Jesse!

16:32.600 --> 16:34.900
Stop it! [groaning]

16:36.500 --> 16:37.967
You OK?

16:37.967 --> 16:41.500
I'm yelling at pictures.
Does this seem normal to you?

16:41.500 --> 16:45.200
Mile, in this family,
I stopped expecting normal
a long time ago.

16:45.200 --> 16:46.467
What's going on?

16:46.467 --> 16:49.033
Remember Jesse, the one
I pretended to like

16:49.033 --> 16:50.900
so you'd maybe like
Jake a little better?

16:50.900 --> 16:53.033
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah.

16:53.033 --> 16:55.467
- So you don't
like Jake anymore?
- Didn't say that.

16:55.467 --> 16:56.800
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah.

16:56.800 --> 16:59.700
- Oh, boy.
- Actually, "oh, boys."

17:00.967 --> 17:03.800
Ooh, well.

17:03.800 --> 17:08.867
Huh. Sounds like you got
yourself in a pretty tough
situation here.

17:08.867 --> 17:10.400
I really feel for ya.

17:10.400 --> 17:12.200
[both sighing]

17:12.200 --> 17:14.800
But it's clear to me there's
only one thing you can do.

17:14.800 --> 17:18.734
Dump 'em both, buy shoes.
Two pair. I'll pay, your choice.

17:18.734 --> 17:22.000
Dad, you are no help at all.
No guy is.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.400
The only thing ya'll are
good for is opening jars,

17:24.400 --> 17:28.567
changing tires and going
downstairs with a baseball bat
when we think we hear something.

17:35.800 --> 17:40.133
Dad, you can show me as many
pictures of shoes as you want,

17:40.133 --> 17:42.400
but it's not gonna
change anything.

17:42.400 --> 17:44.834
But bookmark the page for
when I'm feeling better.

17:44.834 --> 17:49.000
Now Mile, I know I'm
not much good when it
comes to this kinda thing,

17:49.000 --> 17:51.800
but I think I know
someone who is.

17:51.800 --> 17:54.300
Dad, you're not gonna show me
that<i>Gilligan's Island </i>episode

17:54.300 --> 17:56.400
where he had to choose between
Ginger and Mary Ann,

17:56.400 --> 17:58.133
and ends up losing
the both of them?

17:58.133 --> 17:59.734
Yeah, and the banana raft.

17:59.734 --> 18:02.834
I thought for sure it was gonna
get 'em off the island
that time.

18:02.834 --> 18:05.000
Well, but don't worry,

18:05.000 --> 18:08.200
I am positive you've not
seen this before.
