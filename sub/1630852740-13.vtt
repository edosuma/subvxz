00:01.218 --> 00:05.440
<i>Tonight,</i> <i>
a swinger is baring it all.</i>

00:05.483 --> 00:08.617
I swing on and off the
golf course. That's my tagline.

00:08.660 --> 00:11.663
There's nothing stopping you
from achieving a lot more

00:11.707 --> 00:13.143
when you're literally there
naked.

00:13.187 --> 00:15.928
I had three lipos.

00:15.972 --> 00:18.366
He did really well down here,
but there was still, like,

00:18.409 --> 00:21.934
all those rolls
and really bad scarring, too.

00:21.978 --> 00:24.241
<i>
A woman who came to America</i>

00:24.285 --> 00:26.722
<i>with a dream of getting</i> <i>
her nose fixed.</i>

00:26.765 --> 00:28.376
When I was 1 years old,

00:28.419 --> 00:31.727
a flesh-eating bacteria
destroyed my nose.

00:31.770 --> 00:33.816
They always laugh.

00:33.859 --> 00:37.689
I still don't have friends.
I still don't have much.

00:37.733 --> 00:38.821
Obviously, we wanna do

00:38.864 --> 00:40.344
everything in the world
to help you.

00:40.388 --> 00:42.912
<i>And a patient</i> <i>
terrified of anesthesia.</i>

00:42.955 --> 00:45.175
I've always called them
just the janky boobs.

00:45.219 --> 00:48.352
I had this fear something would
happen to me under anesthesia,

00:48.396 --> 00:50.006
and my kids would have
to have lost their mom

00:50.050 --> 00:52.182
in a tragic breast accident.

00:52.226 --> 00:54.924
All right, so let's take
this implant out.

00:54.967 --> 00:57.361
- Look at the crease.
- That's her double bubble.

00:57.405 --> 00:59.363
How many times
have you seen this?

00:59.407 --> 01:01.974
- Never.
- Isn't that crazy?

01:02.018 --> 01:05.108
<i>♪ I wanna be sexy, sexy</i>

01:05.152 --> 01:07.545
<i>♪ I wanna be hot</i>

01:07.589 --> 01:09.982
<i>♪ Fix me, make me beautiful</i>

01:12.289 --> 01:15.249
<i>♪ I wanna be perfect</i>

01:19.644 --> 01:22.908
I'm Patrycia K.,
spelled with a "Y."

01:22.952 --> 01:27.826
I'm from Miami, Florida,
and I'm usually baring it all.

01:27.870 --> 01:31.308
I just love being naked.
I wake up in the morning.

01:31.352 --> 01:32.483
I'm naked. I don't put on
any clothes,

01:32.527 --> 01:34.485
and I get on with my life.

01:34.529 --> 01:36.313
There's less laundry to do.

01:36.357 --> 01:38.750
I just love being free.

01:38.794 --> 01:42.276
You live life
in a completely different light

01:42.319 --> 01:43.755
when you're comfortable
with yourself.

01:43.799 --> 01:46.758
There's nothing stopping you
from achieving a lot more

01:46.802 --> 01:49.326
when you're literally there
naked.

01:49.370 --> 01:51.763
So I think that everyone
should embrace themselves

01:51.807 --> 01:53.156
in the nude.

01:56.203 --> 01:58.857
I would have say that most
of my plastic surgery

01:58.901 --> 02:01.556
has to do with my image
on social media.

02:01.599 --> 02:04.689
What sets me aside from other
social media influencers

02:04.733 --> 02:07.605
is that I have an athletic side
to me

02:07.649 --> 02:10.130
and a very, very naughty side
to me.

02:10.173 --> 02:14.264
So when you put that together,
it's like a crazy combination.

02:14.308 --> 02:16.832
Overall,
I had one labiaplasty.

02:16.875 --> 02:19.835
My kiddie pictures
turn out cute now.

02:19.878 --> 02:21.445
One rhinoplasty.

02:21.489 --> 02:24.231
Three lipos,
one breast augmentation,

02:24.274 --> 02:27.973
and I've had Botox filler
in my face

02:28.017 --> 02:29.323
and filler in my butt.

02:29.366 --> 02:32.195
But after three failed
liposuctions,

02:32.239 --> 02:34.502
I have loose skin,
nasty-ass scars,

02:34.545 --> 02:37.331
and I still have rolls
in the backside.

02:37.374 --> 02:39.028
With how it is right now,

02:39.071 --> 02:41.204
it takes forever
editing my photos

02:41.248 --> 02:43.293
to make sure
it's all smooth and even.

02:43.337 --> 02:44.381
Literally, if you look at me
from the side,

02:44.425 --> 02:46.557
you just see
a wave on my stomach,

02:46.601 --> 02:50.822
and I want it be flat like this.
Flat.

02:55.262 --> 02:57.655
Okay, let's cut this up.

02:57.699 --> 03:00.310
We're gonna make the empanadas.

03:00.354 --> 03:02.704
My name is Edna.
When I was 1 years old,

03:02.747 --> 03:06.011
a flesh-eating bacteria
destroyed my nose.

03:06.055 --> 03:10.146
I have to live my entire life
with the people staring at me,

03:10.190 --> 03:12.670
and it tears me apart.

03:12.714 --> 03:16.326
I was born in Cape Verde,
west coast Africa.

03:16.370 --> 03:18.937
When I was baby, I was sick.

03:18.981 --> 03:20.548
They take me to the hospital,

03:20.591 --> 03:24.247
and later find out I have
this flesh-eating bacteria

03:24.291 --> 03:25.814
destroy my nose.

03:25.857 --> 03:28.991
My dad told the doctor
just to not let me die.

03:29.034 --> 03:30.166
These look good, right?

03:30.210 --> 03:31.863
You're doing a good job.

03:31.907 --> 03:33.256
Man, I'm doing all
the work here.

03:33.300 --> 03:34.562
Okay.

03:34.605 --> 03:37.695
Right now I have
four surgery on my nose.

03:37.739 --> 03:41.046
My last surgery was
six years ago,

03:41.090 --> 03:46.574
and the condition of my nose now
is not what I was expecting.

03:46.617 --> 03:48.271
I wish this never happened,

03:48.315 --> 03:50.665
because it change your life
totally.

03:50.708 --> 03:53.276
And it's very uncomfortable.

03:53.320 --> 03:55.670
Like when you see somebody's
looking at you

03:55.713 --> 03:57.759
different than other people
around.

03:57.802 --> 03:59.413
- Aw.
- Yeah.

03:59.456 --> 04:01.893
People look,
and they turn around.

04:01.937 --> 04:04.026
They look again.

04:04.069 --> 04:07.508
That bring me down.
I wanna get outta there.

04:07.551 --> 04:10.511
Because I don't wanna be judged
what I look like.

04:10.554 --> 04:14.732
I always go to church. I always
help the person in need.

04:14.776 --> 04:18.519
And I don't want people
to look at me as this,

04:18.562 --> 04:20.825
because I'm not this.

04:20.869 --> 04:24.220
I'm not this.

04:27.223 --> 04:29.704
What happened to you,
by the way? You out in the sun?

04:29.747 --> 04:30.792
You're peeling, and you're red.

04:30.835 --> 04:33.273
I know.
I fell asleep in the sun,

04:33.316 --> 04:35.579
uh, for like 20 minutes.

04:35.623 --> 04:36.841
I can see you laying in the pool

04:36.885 --> 04:39.583
with, um, on one of these
beautiful rafts...

04:39.627 --> 04:40.889
- Mm-hmm.
- ...with a cocktail

04:40.932 --> 04:42.325
floating next to you.

04:42.369 --> 04:44.545
We have a swan,
and we have a duck.

04:44.588 --> 04:46.329
We just got a unicorn
in the pool.

04:46.373 --> 04:48.549
A unicorn. Ah. Ah.

04:48.592 --> 04:50.202
That's right, a unicorn.

04:50.246 --> 04:53.380
Who the hell wants a duck
when you can have a unicorn?

04:53.423 --> 04:54.511
All right. What do you got?

04:54.555 --> 04:55.512
So let me talk to you
about a patient.

04:55.556 --> 04:58.515
Some type
of flesh-eating bacteria

04:58.559 --> 05:01.039
ate her nose completely apart.
- Ate her nose.

05:01.083 --> 05:02.998
- So here's Edna.
- Looks like a forehead.

05:03.041 --> 05:05.435
- Looks like a forehead flap.
- Wow.

05:05.479 --> 05:06.567
- But look at that.
- Wow.

05:06.610 --> 05:08.351
She's got hair
from her forehead...

05:08.395 --> 05:09.439
- Yeah.
- ...coming out

05:09.483 --> 05:10.614
the bottom of her nose.

05:10.658 --> 05:12.181
Let's meet her
and let's get her story.

05:12.224 --> 05:13.791
Can you please send in Edna?

05:13.835 --> 05:16.359
- How are you, Edna?
- I'm good. How are you?

05:16.403 --> 05:18.361
- Nice to meet you. Dr. Nassif.
- Okay.

05:18.405 --> 05:19.667
- Dr. Terry Dubrow.
- Dr. Dubrow.

05:19.710 --> 05:21.451
- Pleasure to meet to you.
- Terry, how are you?

05:21.495 --> 05:22.757
- What's your name?
- Yani.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.933
- Nice to meet you.
- Pretty name. Pretty girl.

05:24.976 --> 05:27.239
- Pretty name. Nice to meet you.
- Have a seat, please.

05:27.283 --> 05:28.893
Well, first of all,
thank you for coming to see us.

05:28.937 --> 05:31.809
How many years have you been
here in the United States?

05:31.853 --> 05:33.289
11.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.813
It was always my father plan.

05:35.857 --> 05:38.686
"We gonna find the doctor
that can make your face better."

05:38.729 --> 05:41.166
Is that why he moved here,
for you and your nose?

05:41.210 --> 05:42.254
Yeah.

05:42.298 --> 05:44.996
When I was 27, I got to America.

05:45.040 --> 05:48.086
This isn't only my dream
but my father's dream.

05:52.569 --> 05:54.702
And if I got this fixed,

05:54.745 --> 05:57.008
my father would be
really, really happy.

05:57.052 --> 06:02.449
We heard you had some type
of flesh-eating maybe bacteria

06:02.492 --> 06:05.147
that completely destroyed
your nose?

06:05.190 --> 06:07.236
Yeah, I was at age 1.

06:07.279 --> 06:09.673
They said I have an infection.

06:09.717 --> 06:11.719
- My nose was open.
- Mm.

06:11.762 --> 06:15.462
That's why they--they got
the skin from here.

06:15.505 --> 06:17.159
They put it here.

06:17.202 --> 06:19.683
- Okay, so you had a skin graft.
- Yeah, to my nose.

06:19.727 --> 06:22.120
- As a baby?
- As a baby.

06:22.164 --> 06:25.123
And then the nose get smaller,
then smaller.

06:25.167 --> 06:27.038
Your airway was completely
closed down

06:27.082 --> 06:28.823
'cause the skin grafted
in the stretch with the nose

06:28.866 --> 06:30.781
as you grew.
- Yeah.

06:30.825 --> 06:32.870
When Edna was a baby,
she had a skin graft

06:32.914 --> 06:34.785
taken from her forearm
and placed on her nose.

06:34.829 --> 06:37.048
Now it probably should
have grown

06:37.092 --> 06:38.615
with the rest of her tissue
when she got older,

06:38.659 --> 06:42.402
but somehow it didn't,
and I don't know why.

06:44.926 --> 06:47.058
So you lived
with a nonfunctioning nose

06:47.102 --> 06:48.973
for how many years?

06:49.017 --> 06:51.846
Till I get to America,
I finally find a surgeon

06:51.889 --> 06:55.719
that operate on my nose
in 2013.

06:55.763 --> 06:58.635
First thing they do--
open up the nostril

06:58.679 --> 07:01.072
with the cartilage here.

07:01.116 --> 07:03.727
How much better did they improve
your breathing?

07:03.771 --> 07:05.425
They did improve for one side,
for this side,

07:05.468 --> 07:07.165
but not for this side.

07:07.209 --> 07:10.778
The second surgery to make
my nose look more pointy

07:10.821 --> 07:13.433
make it better shape
than it was before.

07:13.476 --> 07:15.435
So they took the skin graft off,
right?

07:15.478 --> 07:16.653
- Yeah.
- And replaced it

07:16.697 --> 07:18.046
with the forehead skin?
- Forehead flap.

07:18.089 --> 07:21.615
Yes. The third surgery,
the flap, they cut off.

07:21.658 --> 07:22.920
Let me give you a few things,

07:22.964 --> 07:25.009
and maybe you can put 'em
in priority for me.

07:25.053 --> 07:27.011
One is breathing.
Two is the shape.

07:27.055 --> 07:29.971
- Three is the color.
- Yes.

07:30.014 --> 07:32.495
Out of those, which one
would be, you know,

07:32.539 --> 07:35.455
from the most important
to the least important for you.

07:35.498 --> 07:38.066
First is breathing,
two is color,

07:38.109 --> 07:39.763
and third is shape.

07:39.807 --> 07:41.504
So your first priority
is the breathing.

07:41.548 --> 07:43.245
- Yeah.
- Before you came here,

07:43.288 --> 07:46.640
what was it like to grow up
at home with that?

07:46.683 --> 07:48.337
They always laugh.

07:48.380 --> 07:51.471
I still don't have friends.
I still don't have much...

07:51.514 --> 07:54.212
outside life still.

07:54.256 --> 07:56.301
- Now?
- Yeah.

07:56.345 --> 07:59.043
Yeah well, I have my kids.

07:59.087 --> 08:03.483
So...obviously, this has been
hard for you and your sister.

08:03.526 --> 08:04.701
Yes, especially my sister.

08:04.745 --> 08:06.790
She used to come home
crying a lot.

08:06.834 --> 08:09.793
They used to, like, call
my mother names to her face.

08:09.837 --> 08:12.622
They always laugh.
I just don't go into the school.

08:12.666 --> 08:14.319
I just drop her
on the sidewalk.

08:14.363 --> 08:18.498
Just like to not have them
have a bad day.

08:18.541 --> 08:20.412
First of all,
when we hear your story,

08:20.456 --> 08:22.458
I mean, it's tragic, and we
thank God you have your kids.

08:22.502 --> 08:23.677
Yeah.

08:23.720 --> 08:25.940
But if you don't have your kids,
I mean...

08:25.983 --> 08:29.030
I don't know.
I cannot even imagine.

08:29.073 --> 08:33.164
Edna moved to this country
wanting that feeling of freedom.

08:33.208 --> 08:36.167
But instead,
her nose has held her back.

08:36.211 --> 08:38.561
She doesn't feel comfortable
letting people see her.

08:38.605 --> 08:40.345
Hopefully, there's something
we can do to help

08:40.389 --> 08:44.654
so she will finally be able
to live the American dream.

08:44.698 --> 08:46.526
Obviously, we wanna do

08:46.569 --> 08:47.614
everything in the world
to help you.

08:50.617 --> 08:54.577
The possibility there
would be to open up

08:54.621 --> 08:57.101
the lower half of this,
kinda lift it,

08:57.145 --> 08:59.016
but the skin could die,
and if it did,

08:59.060 --> 09:01.671
we'd have to go
to the right forehead

09:01.715 --> 09:04.587
and do a graft.
- No pressure.

09:04.631 --> 09:07.024
He had a bird in his office
talking while I had my surgery.

09:07.068 --> 09:08.852
Like a parrot?

09:08.896 --> 09:12.813
It would say, "Hello. Hello."

09:14.162 --> 09:16.512
<i>♪ I wanna be perfect</i>

09:16.556 --> 09:18.819
All right, let's take a peek
at your nose.

09:18.862 --> 09:22.649
Here it's limited,
and the airway's closed here.

09:22.692 --> 09:25.129
Put this away.

09:25.173 --> 09:28.089
Obviously, you have
a challenging problem.

09:28.132 --> 09:30.091
So one of the things
that may be a possibility

09:30.134 --> 09:32.310
is to try to add rib

09:32.354 --> 09:34.399
to try to reconstruct
your airway

09:34.443 --> 09:36.793
to get more air in your nose.

09:36.837 --> 09:38.229
- Okay.
- Okay?

09:38.273 --> 09:41.189
In regards to the shape
and the form,

09:41.232 --> 09:43.017
the possibility there would be

09:43.060 --> 09:45.628
to open up the lower half
of this,

09:45.672 --> 09:49.371
kinda lift it,
make it less bulky,

09:49.414 --> 09:53.462
try to remove some of that skin
that has hair on it even.

09:53.505 --> 09:55.420
- Okay.
- This comes with risks.

09:55.464 --> 09:58.293
By me playing with this,
this could actually die.

09:58.336 --> 10:01.035
If it did, we'd have to go
to the right forehead

10:01.078 --> 10:02.689
and do a graft.

10:02.732 --> 10:05.735
I wish I can guarantee Edna
a surgery with no risk,

10:05.779 --> 10:08.869
but her columella
is hanging on by a thread

10:08.912 --> 10:11.219
and could die during surgery.

10:11.262 --> 10:12.568
And the last thing
any of us want

10:12.612 --> 10:15.571
is for the whole thing
to necrose and die.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.268
What everyone's still
gonna look at

10:17.312 --> 10:19.706
is the color of your nose.
- I know.

10:19.749 --> 10:22.796
But we do have
one secret weapon.

10:22.839 --> 10:24.885
It's a permanent makeup.

10:24.928 --> 10:26.930
The goal would be to try to
match this color up here

10:26.974 --> 10:31.152
and to paint this so that all
looks like one color.

10:31.195 --> 10:32.762
I never heard it before.

10:32.806 --> 10:36.679
Why nobody, not even the doctor
that do my surgery prior,

10:36.723 --> 10:41.336
tell me, like, tattoo? Yes.
I am doing it.

10:41.379 --> 10:42.598
Finally, they're gonna change
the color.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.948
That's what you really wanted.

10:44.992 --> 10:46.254
Do you wanna take this chance?

10:46.297 --> 10:49.474
I do. Without think twice, I do.

10:49.518 --> 10:51.825
Then we get to look
at your face again.

10:51.868 --> 10:54.044
- Yeah.
- So it's time to start living

10:54.088 --> 10:57.961
the American dream,
and I'm hoping--no pressure...

10:58.005 --> 11:01.008
...that he will
give you the American dream.

11:01.051 --> 11:02.705
I hope with everything.

11:02.749 --> 11:04.272
This is gonna change
a lot of things.

11:04.315 --> 11:06.317
- Look at this cute smile.
- I know.

11:06.361 --> 11:09.886
This is gonna change
a lot of my life.

11:12.802 --> 11:14.238
Brace yourself.

11:14.282 --> 11:17.459
Um...so first off, well,
there's this beautiful little...

11:17.502 --> 11:19.896
So you can see
all underneath here.

11:19.940 --> 11:22.899
This is just breast tissue
that I don't really know.

11:22.943 --> 11:25.336
I guess this is my fold.
I'm not really sure.

11:25.380 --> 11:27.512
This side is the same.

11:27.556 --> 11:32.039
So it's not comfortable
for sure. Not comfortable.

11:32.082 --> 11:33.954
My name is Piper.
I'm 37 years old.

11:33.997 --> 11:37.392
And, girl, let me tell you.
I've got a janky set.

11:37.435 --> 11:39.524
I've always called 'em
just the janky boobs.

11:39.568 --> 11:41.309
The breast tissue
is completely separate

11:41.352 --> 11:44.529
from what I think is the muscle
and the implant.

11:44.573 --> 11:48.490
It's hanging over the top,
and they're just growing

11:48.533 --> 11:50.797
a baby boob underneath.

11:50.840 --> 11:54.888
I was under the impression
that I had nice-sized boobs,

11:54.931 --> 11:58.413
but after I had
my daughter and my son,

11:58.456 --> 12:01.982
I lost about 50 pounds,
and my boobs--

12:02.025 --> 12:04.288
they were just saggy skin.

12:04.332 --> 12:07.335
So I decided to have surgery.

12:07.378 --> 12:09.772
We were in, like,
a surgery suite in his office.

12:09.816 --> 12:13.341
He had a bird in his office
talking while I had my surgery.

12:13.384 --> 12:14.777
- He did.
- Like a parrot?

12:18.563 --> 12:20.740
It would say,
"Hello. Hello. Hello."

12:20.783 --> 12:22.959
And I asked one of
the surgery techs about it.

12:23.003 --> 12:25.353
I'm like, "What is going on?"
And she was like,

12:25.396 --> 12:27.355
"Oh, yeah, the doctor
has a pet bird

12:27.398 --> 12:29.183
that he keeps in his office,
and it talks."

12:29.226 --> 12:32.142
Okay, well, here we are.

12:32.186 --> 12:34.101
Obviously,
I made a great choice.

12:34.144 --> 12:37.147
I've had two surgeries,
and it's been eight years

12:37.191 --> 12:38.192
since my last surgery,

12:38.235 --> 12:41.673
and my breasts look janky
as ever.

12:41.717 --> 12:44.067
My GYN sees them progress
each year,

12:44.111 --> 12:45.112
and this year, he was like,

12:45.155 --> 12:47.767
"Okay, it's time
to address this."

12:47.810 --> 12:48.898
This last time, he was like,
"I'm almost worried

12:48.942 --> 12:50.857
it's a medical issue
at this point."

12:50.900 --> 12:52.772
And he was like,
"Have you ever heard

12:52.815 --> 12:55.035
"of Dr. Dubrow
and Dr. Nassif?

12:55.078 --> 12:58.821
I know that they fixed some
really messed-up situations,"

12:58.865 --> 13:00.127
and I was like,
"Mine aren't that bad."

13:00.170 --> 13:02.825
And he was like...
"Well, they are."

13:02.869 --> 13:05.741
So I was like,
this man sees boobs

13:05.785 --> 13:09.092
all day every day,
so they must be bad.

13:09.136 --> 13:12.487
They just continue to impress me

13:12.530 --> 13:14.445
with how janky they get
year by year.

13:20.538 --> 13:23.454
- Piper.
- Hello!

13:23.498 --> 13:25.195
So where do you guys
come in from?

13:25.239 --> 13:26.457
Arkansas.

13:26.501 --> 13:28.633
- We've been friends for...
- 21 years.

13:28.677 --> 13:29.591
- 21 years.
- We met in high school.

13:29.634 --> 13:30.853
- Yeah.
- Wow.

13:30.897 --> 13:33.073
So you were around
during this whole...

13:33.116 --> 13:36.076
- Yes, all of it. Yes.
- ...extravaganza situation.

13:36.119 --> 13:38.469
You originally got a breast
augmentation how long ago?

13:38.513 --> 13:40.776
It was 2012.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.734
I had a friend
that was like,

13:42.778 --> 13:44.432
"Why would you even
consider this?"

13:44.475 --> 13:47.217
And the look on her face
when she saw my breasts--

13:47.261 --> 13:50.351
she said,
"I would cut them off."

13:50.394 --> 13:52.092
- Oh, really?
- "Those look like beef jerky."

13:52.135 --> 13:53.833
- Aw.
- Okay.

13:53.876 --> 13:55.182
- And I was like, no.
- It wasn't me.

13:55.225 --> 13:56.792
No, it wasn't her.
She would not have said that.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.794
You wouldn't?
Okay. So you thought

13:58.838 --> 14:00.665
about doing something about it.

14:00.709 --> 14:04.539
I did. So I consulted
with a few plastic surgeons

14:04.582 --> 14:06.367
in our area.
- Yeah.

14:06.410 --> 14:08.717
The one I chose
did conscious sedation.

14:08.760 --> 14:10.937
Because I had this fear

14:10.980 --> 14:12.460
something would happen to me
under anesthesia,

14:12.503 --> 14:14.288
and my kids would have to have
lost their mom

14:14.331 --> 14:16.464
in a tragic breast accident.

14:16.507 --> 14:18.727
I actually understand that
because most people

14:18.770 --> 14:21.686
are not so much afraid
of the surgery necessarily.

14:21.730 --> 14:23.427
They're afraid
of the anesthesia, right?

14:23.471 --> 14:25.690
Mm-hmm.
Apparently, they use ketamine.

14:25.734 --> 14:28.302
I remember knowing
I was in my body but not,

14:28.345 --> 14:29.738
and not being able to move.

14:29.781 --> 14:32.959
Nobody could hear me.
It was horrific.

14:33.002 --> 14:36.745
Ketamine is a sometimes-used
anesthetic agent

14:36.788 --> 14:39.400
that allows a dissociation

14:39.443 --> 14:41.793
between your awareness
of your body

14:41.837 --> 14:43.273
and the surgical procedure.

14:43.317 --> 14:46.189
A few weeks later, I noticed
a start of a double bubble

14:46.233 --> 14:47.451
under the right breast.
- Yeah.

14:47.495 --> 14:48.844
The breast tissue
was completely separate

14:48.888 --> 14:52.979
from what I think is the muscle
in the implant.

14:53.022 --> 14:56.939
A double bubble means
you've lifted up too far

14:56.983 --> 14:58.941
below the muscle,
below the chest wall

14:58.985 --> 15:02.031
where the breast ends
and the abdomen starts,

15:02.075 --> 15:03.511
because you're trying
to fill out

15:03.554 --> 15:05.252
as much of the breast envelope
as possible.

15:05.295 --> 15:07.819
And to fix a double bubble,
you have to stitch it back down.

15:07.863 --> 15:10.257
He also went
into the left side again

15:10.300 --> 15:11.432
'cause he said he could tell

15:11.475 --> 15:12.607
where that was starting
to do it also.

15:12.650 --> 15:14.870
Yeah.
Under conscious sedation again?

15:14.914 --> 15:17.525
Well, I said, "I put that as
an allergy on my chart.

15:17.568 --> 15:19.092
I do not ever want that again."
- Right.

15:19.135 --> 15:22.225
And he said,
"Then I'll just numb you up

15:22.269 --> 15:24.445
with some Lidocaine and--"
- Fix a double bubble?

15:24.488 --> 15:26.403
- With Lidocaine.
- Oh, okay.

15:26.447 --> 15:28.623
I remember smelling
my flesh burning.

15:28.666 --> 15:30.277
- Mm-hmm.
- I could see smoke.

15:30.320 --> 15:33.019
- So what happened after that?
- They looked worse.

15:33.062 --> 15:35.630
The double bubble was still
there on both sides.

15:35.673 --> 15:36.892
- Correct.
- Okay.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.721
Yeah. And I was not gonna go
back there.

15:39.764 --> 15:41.636
About a year later,

15:41.679 --> 15:43.725
I did consult with one
other surgeon in our area.

15:43.768 --> 15:45.248
He was supposed to be the best
of the best in the state.

15:45.292 --> 15:47.076
- Okay.
- So I was still hopeful

15:47.120 --> 15:49.383
going into the office,
and I take off my top.

15:49.426 --> 15:52.560
He said, "Sorry, there's really
not much we can do with that."

15:52.603 --> 15:54.388
There might be some truth
to that.

15:54.431 --> 15:56.738
Oh, no. Don't say that.

15:56.781 --> 15:58.131
This is not that common
a thing,

15:58.174 --> 16:01.134
so it's not really exactly
taught in your training,

16:01.177 --> 16:02.874
how to deal
with this complex problem.

16:02.918 --> 16:05.051
- Gotcha.
- Unfortunately.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.706
When I go out
on the golf course,

16:08.750 --> 16:11.753
people don't take me seriously.

16:11.796 --> 16:15.583
I drive for show
and putt for dough.

16:15.626 --> 16:18.412
- New graft.
- Oh, that looks pretty.

16:19.848 --> 16:22.068
We just dropped
the diced cartilage glue graft

16:22.111 --> 16:25.158
on the floor. There's no
5-second rule on this one.

16:26.681 --> 16:28.944
<i>♪ I wanna be perfect</i>

16:34.384 --> 16:37.866
So... Piper, now let me
see what's going on here.

16:37.909 --> 16:40.216
This is
a very big double bubble,

16:40.260 --> 16:42.697
and...relax for a second.

16:42.740 --> 16:44.873
When you look at the distance

16:44.916 --> 16:49.138
between the bottom
of your areola and your crease,

16:49.182 --> 16:53.012
even in someone
who has had kids, lost weight,

16:53.055 --> 16:55.710
it's still only
3 1/2 centimeters.

16:55.753 --> 17:01.063
The normal crease on most girls
is, like, 9.

17:01.107 --> 17:02.586
Okay.

17:02.630 --> 17:05.285
That in and of itself
is a setup for a double bubble.

17:05.328 --> 17:09.593
The shorter the distance
between the bottom of the areola

17:09.637 --> 17:10.812
and the breast crease,

17:10.855 --> 17:12.379
the less you can actually
lower the crease,

17:12.422 --> 17:15.425
and the greater the chance
you will get a double bubble.

17:15.469 --> 17:17.688
You're gonna need
the nipple lifted up

17:17.732 --> 17:21.127
and the dimensions
of the breast envelope change

17:21.170 --> 17:24.086
so that everything
is married together.

17:24.130 --> 17:25.696
- Okay.
- And so we have to cut away

17:25.740 --> 17:28.308
some of the blood supply
to get it lifted up,

17:28.351 --> 17:29.961
which means the greater
the chance

17:30.005 --> 17:32.225
that you'll have blood supply
problems in the nipple,

17:32.268 --> 17:33.095
and you could lose a nipple.

17:33.139 --> 17:34.053
- Mm.
- Hard.

17:34.096 --> 17:35.750
- Yeah.
- Risky.

17:35.793 --> 17:37.056
How do you feel about this?

17:37.099 --> 17:40.276
I came into this believing
and having faith

17:40.320 --> 17:43.149
that you were the best
and trusting that I would go

17:43.192 --> 17:44.933
with your suggestion.

17:44.976 --> 17:48.154
Um, if the nipple dies,
I feel like we can make

17:48.197 --> 17:50.069
a good situation
out of whatever happens,

17:50.112 --> 17:51.461
'cause right now it's not good.

17:51.505 --> 17:53.115
It's a medical issue
at this point.

17:53.159 --> 17:55.552
So that's why
I'm putting my faith in them,

17:55.596 --> 17:58.120
putting my fear aside,
and going with it.

17:58.164 --> 17:59.948
- Okay, so you're in.
- I'm in.

17:59.991 --> 18:01.123
All right.

18:07.260 --> 18:10.437
When I play golf,
people don't take me seriously.

18:12.395 --> 18:14.528
<i>♪ Walk by</i> <i>

18:14.571 --> 18:18.184

18:23.145 --> 18:27.236
I have a nice body.
I can swing a golf club.

18:27.280 --> 18:30.761
And it just amazes people.
It's an eye catcher.

18:32.154 --> 18:34.156
- Hey, Patty!
- Hey, girl!

18:34.200 --> 18:35.331
Hey, girl! How are you?

18:35.375 --> 18:38.421
- Good. How are you?
- Good. Oh, wow.

18:38.465 --> 18:40.206
I did not know you were
going to be naked.

18:40.249 --> 18:41.511
I thought we were
just playing golf.

18:41.555 --> 18:43.861
Being naked is now
a big part of me.

18:43.905 --> 18:48.039
I had the opportunity
to play around naked

18:48.083 --> 18:50.085
the last time I was
in Las Vegas.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.652
And you just see the guys
parked their cars

18:51.695 --> 18:53.784
and, like, stare.

18:53.828 --> 18:56.483
- You lookin'.
- I'm lookin'. I'm lookin'.

18:58.398 --> 19:01.705
Oh, jeez, girl.
You're gonna knock a bird out.

19:01.749 --> 19:03.446
All right, all right.

19:03.490 --> 19:05.405
- I'll try.
- I love it, I love it.

19:05.448 --> 19:10.061
Let's just say that I drive
for show and putt for dough.

19:10.105 --> 19:11.193
- Can I start swinging now?
- Yeah.

19:11.237 --> 19:13.935
Hell, yeah.
What kind of swinging?

19:13.978 --> 19:16.503
You let me know.

19:16.546 --> 19:19.419
I definitely love
swinging on the golf course,

19:19.462 --> 19:23.074
but I'm also a swinger
off the golf course.

19:23.118 --> 19:26.121
It's just such a great feeling
being open, being naked. Like...

19:26.165 --> 19:27.253
You're crazy, girl.
I don't know.

19:27.296 --> 19:28.732
I couldn't do it.

19:28.776 --> 19:30.908
The only thing is, is that
I have this loose skin,

19:30.952 --> 19:32.519
as you can see.
- Yeah.

19:32.562 --> 19:34.085
The creasing,
the ugly-ass scars.

19:34.129 --> 19:36.740
I even have some in the back.
You see?

19:36.784 --> 19:38.307
Oh.

19:38.351 --> 19:42.398
So now you're going to see
Dr. Dubrow and Nassif, right?

19:42.442 --> 19:44.313
- Yes!
- All right. Here we go.

19:44.357 --> 19:46.837
- Whoo!
- Bam!

19:46.881 --> 19:48.578
Way to go!

19:48.622 --> 19:49.927
Yes, yes!

19:54.845 --> 19:56.412
- Hi.
- Edna.

19:56.456 --> 19:57.544
- Hello.
- What do you think?

19:57.587 --> 20:01.200
I think okay.
I am in good hands,

20:01.243 --> 20:02.679
and God is with us.

20:02.723 --> 20:04.420
Well, we'll take great care
of you.

20:04.464 --> 20:06.248
Two areas
we have to be careful about

20:06.292 --> 20:09.556
is the possible loss
of Edna's columella,

20:09.599 --> 20:11.253
or while we defat the flap
that she has

20:11.297 --> 20:13.690
on the tip of her nose--
that can kill it.

20:18.391 --> 20:20.001
<i>
For Edna's surgery today,</i>

20:20.044 --> 20:22.917
<i>I will elevate the skin flap</i> <i>
while Dr. Peng harvests rib.</i>

20:22.960 --> 20:24.527
<i>Next, we will perform</i> <i>
the septoplasty,</i>

20:24.571 --> 20:27.791
<i>which will improve her breathing</i> <i>
and then defat the flap</i>

20:27.835 --> 20:29.271
<i>and remove skin</i> <i>
with hair growing out of it</i>

20:29.315 --> 20:31.839
<i>to give her a better shape</i> <i>
and overall appearance.</i>

20:31.882 --> 20:35.146
<i>Finally, we will add a rim graft</i> <i>
to pop out her right nostril</i>

20:35.190 --> 20:37.888
<i>so it matches the left
and a diced cartilage glue graft</i>

20:37.932 --> 20:40.282
<i>to smooth out</i> <i>
her dorsum and tip.</i>

20:40.326 --> 20:43.459
All right,
so what I need to do is elevate

20:43.503 --> 20:46.462
the flap from the nose
at this point.

20:46.506 --> 20:48.725
- The rib is gonna come out.
- Excellent.

20:48.769 --> 20:51.250
Decently nice.
It's not as thick.

20:51.293 --> 20:52.729
- It's not that thick.
- Yeah.

20:52.773 --> 20:56.037
So we got the skin
and the flaps opened up.

20:56.080 --> 20:57.560
Oh.

20:57.604 --> 21:00.259
Uh-oh. My goodness.
That was one big piece of rib.

21:00.302 --> 21:02.304
We just took out a chunk of rib

21:02.348 --> 21:04.654
and just laid it
on the tip of her nose.

21:04.698 --> 21:06.395
And we'll quickly just put
the whole thing there, yeah.

21:06.439 --> 21:09.442
Usually when you use rib,
you cut in your pieces

21:09.485 --> 21:11.487
to create grafts to stretch
through the nose.

21:11.531 --> 21:13.707
You don't stick a whole piece
of rib in there.

21:13.750 --> 21:16.536
So that most likely
is what's causing

21:16.579 --> 21:18.625
most of this bulkiness
in her nose.

21:18.668 --> 21:22.281
Now removing some of the fat
in the flap.

21:22.324 --> 21:24.413
Now with the defatting
the actual flap,

21:24.457 --> 21:26.894
I would hope that her nose
is gonna look

21:26.937 --> 21:29.505
a lot better and smaller.

21:29.549 --> 21:32.595
Okay. That's all hair.

21:32.639 --> 21:36.730
Hair's being removed.
Okay, that looks good.

21:36.773 --> 21:40.342
The next part of this is gonna
be the key, key, key graft.

21:40.386 --> 21:42.213
- I made a cute, little...
- Watch out. Watch out.

21:42.257 --> 21:45.782
...diced cartilage glue graft.
- Oh, that looks pretty.

21:49.003 --> 21:50.744
We just dropped
the diced cartilage glue graft

21:50.787 --> 21:54.008
on the floor, which was
supposed to help smooth out

21:54.051 --> 21:56.010
Edna's dorsum and tip.

21:56.053 --> 21:58.534
Unfortunately, there's no
5-second rule on this one.

21:58.578 --> 22:01.537
Luckily, we have
a lot of cartilage left

22:01.581 --> 22:03.626
so all I can say is,
another one bites the dust,

22:03.670 --> 22:06.368
and let's make sure
we drop no more.

22:06.412 --> 22:07.761
I gotta make sure
I grab it over here,

22:07.804 --> 22:10.981
because it's--
here, let me grab.

22:11.025 --> 22:14.028
Right there on the flap.

22:14.071 --> 22:16.422
That's beautiful. Love that.

22:16.465 --> 22:17.901
This is gonna be tricky
right over here

22:17.945 --> 22:22.210
because now that's gonna sort of
come over the columella.

22:22.253 --> 22:25.648
- Is it gonna close the skin?
- Yep, so far it looks like it.

22:25.692 --> 22:28.259
- Okay, great job.
- It looks great.

22:28.303 --> 22:31.393
Yeah, she's gonna be so happy.
Edna, you got a new nose.

22:31.437 --> 22:32.916
Everything went pretty well.

22:32.960 --> 22:37.051
Now the question's gonna be
how does the skin heal?

22:37.094 --> 22:38.226
We were able to get that skin

22:38.269 --> 22:41.577
just to close
over the columella.

22:41.621 --> 22:42.970
There's always that fear
that it's gonna die,

22:43.013 --> 22:44.450
but right now at least
on the table,

22:44.493 --> 22:46.408
it looks pretty good.

22:46.452 --> 22:49.019
All right,
so let's take this implant out.

22:49.063 --> 22:51.457
- Look at the crease.
- That's her double bubble.

22:51.500 --> 22:54.198
How many times
have you seen this?

22:54.242 --> 22:56.418
- Never.
- Isn't that crazy?

22:56.462 --> 22:58.768
Maybe after our consultation,

22:58.812 --> 23:02.511
I could teach you how to swing
on or off the golf course?

23:02.555 --> 23:04.687
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby.

23:06.254 --> 23:08.212
<i>♪ I wanna be perfect</i>

23:09.518 --> 23:10.911
- Piper.
- Hello.

23:10.954 --> 23:13.392
- How are you?
- I'm all right. How are you?

23:13.435 --> 23:15.219
I wanna introduce you
to our anesthesiologist,

23:15.263 --> 23:17.526
Dr. Mest, okay?
- Hello.

23:17.570 --> 23:21.965
Going under anesthesia,
I'm wary of it. I'm nervous.

23:22.009 --> 23:26.143
Um, but I'm here,
so I'm trying to be positive,

23:26.187 --> 23:27.928
think positively,
but I want to puke.

23:27.971 --> 23:31.366
That's how I feel about
the risks of my surgery.

23:31.410 --> 23:33.455
I wanna make sure
that he's gonna do

23:33.499 --> 23:36.240
exactly what he always does,
which is give you

23:36.284 --> 23:38.417
the proper levels
of anesthesia.

23:38.460 --> 23:40.506
Yeah, don't wanna tell my kids
that they lost me

23:40.549 --> 23:41.768
in a tragic boob accident.

23:41.811 --> 23:44.597
That's my biggest fear, so...

23:44.640 --> 23:46.468
- We're here now.
- So...yeah.

23:46.512 --> 23:47.643
He's not bad, too.

23:47.687 --> 23:50.080
Yeah. Oh! He made a joke!

23:50.124 --> 23:51.604
He got you.

23:56.652 --> 23:58.306
<i>
For Piper's surgery today,</i>

23:58.349 --> 24:01.265
<i>I'll begin by making an incision</i> <i>
below the areolas</i>

24:01.309 --> 24:02.441
<i>and release</i> <i>
the pectoralis major muscle.</i>

24:02.484 --> 24:05.269
<i>Next, I will remove</i> <i>
her old implants</i>

24:05.313 --> 24:06.488
<i>and then stitch down the muscle</i>

24:06.532 --> 24:08.272
<i>to recreate</i> <i>
the old breast pocket</i>

24:08.316 --> 24:10.797
<i>and restore</i> <i>
the inframammary crease.</i>

24:10.840 --> 24:13.495
<i>I will then insert new implants</i> <i>
before performing a lift,</i>

24:13.539 --> 24:17.064
<i>and then finally cut around</i> <i>
and release her areolas,</i>

24:17.107 --> 24:19.414
<i>so I can move them up to
the center of her breast mounds.</i>

24:19.458 --> 24:22.504
Okay, so the first thing you do
is to release the muscle

24:22.548 --> 24:26.116
that attaches
to the overlying breast tissue

24:26.160 --> 24:30.991
so that when she flexes,
it doesn't distort her breasts

24:31.034 --> 24:33.384
the way it did before.

24:33.428 --> 24:35.822
All right, so let's take
this implant out.

24:35.865 --> 24:37.171
See what the story is.

24:37.214 --> 24:39.913
This is intact silicone implant,
which is good.

24:39.956 --> 24:41.175
Look at the crease.

24:41.218 --> 24:43.525
Yeah. You know what's that from?

24:43.569 --> 24:44.831
That's her double bubble.

24:44.874 --> 24:46.659
How many times
have you seen this?

24:46.702 --> 24:48.182
- Never.
- Isn't that crazy?

24:48.225 --> 24:49.966
Breast implants are amazing.

24:50.010 --> 24:51.577
You can throw 'em
down on the ground.

24:51.620 --> 24:55.189
You can roll on them.
You can run 'em over with a car.

24:55.232 --> 24:59.498
I've never seen one with
a permanent crease put into it.

24:59.541 --> 25:01.456
That tells you it was
under great tension

25:01.500 --> 25:05.025
and great pressure
for a number of years,

25:05.068 --> 25:06.940
and that crease is permanent.

25:06.983 --> 25:11.379
So we've gotta basically take
this muscle and the capsule

25:11.422 --> 25:13.860
that formed around the implant
and sew it down

25:13.903 --> 25:16.558
so that hopefully
it will restore

25:16.602 --> 25:20.040
the old breast pocket
the way it should have been.

25:20.083 --> 25:21.650
This is one of
the trickier things to do

25:21.694 --> 25:23.870
in breast revision surgery.

25:23.913 --> 25:27.177
Restoring the old breast pocket
to its original dimensions

25:27.221 --> 25:28.744
is called a capsulorrhaphy.

25:28.788 --> 25:31.530
Basically, you take
the surrounding tissue.

25:31.573 --> 25:34.707
You stitch it down
to the back wall of the breast

25:34.750 --> 25:37.710
to try to get it to be
this perfectly round

25:37.753 --> 25:40.582
360-dimensioned pocket.

25:40.626 --> 25:41.670
Doesn't that look like
the original crease?

25:41.714 --> 25:42.889
Mm-hmm.

25:42.932 --> 25:44.804
Perfect. So here's the question.

25:44.847 --> 25:52.899
Can we move this tight, short,
creased areola up here?

25:52.942 --> 25:55.118
I don't know.
That's a long way to go.

25:55.162 --> 25:57.425
A lot of people think
when you do a breast lift

25:57.468 --> 25:58.992
and you wanna move
the nipples up,

25:59.035 --> 26:00.384
you just take 'em off and put
'em up in a higher position.

26:00.428 --> 26:03.257
You can't do that
'cause it'll just die

26:03.300 --> 26:04.867
'cause it has no blood supply.

26:04.911 --> 26:07.130
So to move the nipple up,
you remove the skin above it

26:07.174 --> 26:10.656
and move the nipple
and the tissue with it

26:10.699 --> 26:13.876
into that area
and close the skin around it,

26:13.920 --> 26:19.273
leaving the underlying nipple
blood supply intact.

26:19.316 --> 26:21.057
Can I get it up there,
move it higher?

26:21.101 --> 26:22.755
Let me see something.

26:22.798 --> 26:25.801
Hoping it won't be
a post-operative nightmare.

26:25.845 --> 26:29.283
Stay alive, nipple.
All right, let's sit this up.

26:31.677 --> 26:34.157
Whoa!

26:34.201 --> 26:37.465
Unbelievable, a week ago
from that to that.

26:37.508 --> 26:39.685
I think Piper should be
really happy with this. No?

26:39.728 --> 26:41.948
- Yeah, looks really good.
- Let's close.

26:45.516 --> 26:47.475
Okay, so our next patient today
is Patrycia.

26:47.518 --> 26:52.741
She's had some liposuction
that has gone wrong.

26:52.785 --> 26:56.484
Very big scars, some loose skin,
some irregularities,

26:56.527 --> 27:00.401
and this woman was
on a golfing scholarship.

27:00.444 --> 27:03.230
- No!
- She's like a super good golfer.

27:03.273 --> 27:04.318
- Now you're interesting.
- So now I'm like--

27:04.361 --> 27:06.059
Now you're interested.

27:06.102 --> 27:07.321
But can I talk
a little golf with her?

27:07.364 --> 27:09.236
You can definitely talk golf
with her.

27:09.279 --> 27:12.152
Please, as soon as possible,
send Patrycia in here.

27:13.153 --> 27:15.068
- There she is.
- Hi.

27:15.111 --> 27:16.547
- Patrycia.
- Miss Patrycia.

27:16.591 --> 27:17.679
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you. Dr. Nassif.

27:17.723 --> 27:19.159
Terry Dubrow.
Pleasure to meet you.

27:19.202 --> 27:20.421
- Nice to meet you.
- Sami.

27:20.464 --> 27:21.422
- Sami, how are you?
- Hi, Sami. Terry Dubrow.

27:21.465 --> 27:22.466
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

27:22.510 --> 27:23.598
- You, too.
- Have a seat.

27:23.642 --> 27:25.469
Patrycia,
I gotta tell you something.

27:25.513 --> 27:26.819
He's very excited
that you're here.

27:26.862 --> 27:28.211
- I'm very excited.
- That's what I like to hear.

27:28.255 --> 27:30.039
Yeah. Obviously,
you have an expertise

27:30.083 --> 27:31.171
and interest in golf, right?

27:31.214 --> 27:32.215
- Yes.
- You're a big-time golfer.

27:32.259 --> 27:33.869
Forget about
the plastic surgery.

27:33.913 --> 27:35.436
I wanna talk about golf.

27:35.479 --> 27:37.917
So what is your swing? Just,
will you stand up, Patrycia?

27:37.960 --> 27:39.440
- Yeah.
- Come over here, okay?

27:39.483 --> 27:42.486
Even though you don't have
a club, show us your swing.

27:42.530 --> 27:43.705
Got a do a little shimmy.

27:43.749 --> 27:44.750
Gotta do a shimmy.

27:44.793 --> 27:47.491
I'm bringing it back
all the way,

27:47.535 --> 27:49.842
dropping the club,
and releasing the hips.

27:49.885 --> 27:51.408
- Boo-yah.
- So you bumped.

27:51.452 --> 27:54.237
Mm-hmm. The majority of my speed
comes from my hips,

27:54.281 --> 27:55.674
the twerk in the hips.
- So--So you twerking?

27:55.717 --> 27:57.763
Okay, so you see you twerk
in the hips.

27:57.806 --> 27:58.938
- Yeah.
- Let's see that.

27:58.981 --> 28:00.330
- Go side to side here.
- Well, hold on.

28:00.374 --> 28:01.375
- We'll do it together. Ready?
- Yeah, let's do it.

28:01.418 --> 28:02.637
Let's backswing together.

28:02.681 --> 28:05.422
- And back and... uhh!
- Whoo!

28:05.466 --> 28:08.338
That looks great,
but it works so much better

28:08.382 --> 28:09.862
when you don't have a club
and a ball on the ground.

28:09.905 --> 28:10.993
I know.

28:11.037 --> 28:13.866
Paul is really good
at pretend golf.

28:13.909 --> 28:15.824
At least he's good at something.

28:15.868 --> 28:19.915
Maybe after our consultation,
I could teach you how to swing

28:19.959 --> 28:21.743
on or off the golf course.

28:21.787 --> 28:23.919
Oh, ba--Ooh, baby.

28:23.963 --> 28:25.225
Are you a swinger?
Is that what we're hearing?

28:25.268 --> 28:26.748
Yes, I am.

28:26.792 --> 28:28.619
What does that mean, to be
a swinger in this day and age?

28:28.663 --> 28:32.580
Me and my husband have
an open sexual relationship.

28:32.623 --> 28:33.537
Ohh.

28:33.581 --> 28:35.104
That's the whole swinger thing.

28:35.148 --> 28:37.150
Yeah, I swing on and off
the golf course.

28:37.193 --> 28:39.587
- That's my tagline.
- Really?

28:39.630 --> 28:41.023
Ahh. You go
to the swinger parties?

28:41.067 --> 28:45.419
Yes, I throw our own, too,
do like a hot wife orgy

28:45.462 --> 28:47.726
or just a bunch of couples
together.

28:47.769 --> 28:49.423
What is a hot wife orgy?

28:49.466 --> 28:50.380
What is it, hot wives?

28:50.424 --> 28:51.904
Yeah, what is that?

28:51.947 --> 28:53.993
Yeah, so it's pretty much
a bunch of wives that come in.

28:54.036 --> 28:55.951
Their husbands come to watch.

28:55.995 --> 28:59.215
And we invite a bunch
of single dudes to participate.

28:59.259 --> 29:00.869
You're kidding me.

29:00.913 --> 29:04.612
So what if the husband doesn't
like what the dude is doing

29:04.655 --> 29:06.135
to the hot wife?

29:06.179 --> 29:08.137
Does your husband say, "Eee-ee,"
like the dolphin thing?

29:08.181 --> 29:09.486
Ah-ah?

29:09.530 --> 29:11.358
I would invoke the dolphin.
I would go right--

29:11.401 --> 29:12.446
Now every time
I'm gonna swing now,

29:12.489 --> 29:13.577
I'll think of dolphins.

29:13.621 --> 29:15.231
You're gonna, "Eee-ee."

29:15.275 --> 29:17.930
Eee-ee. Eee-ee. Eee-ee.

29:17.973 --> 29:19.845
Eee-ee.

29:19.888 --> 29:22.412
So, Patrycia, interesting,

29:22.456 --> 29:25.502
because you went from a person
very serious about golf

29:25.546 --> 29:27.722
to someone who is very serious
about plastic surgery, right?

29:27.766 --> 29:28.941
- Yeah.
- How did that happen?

29:28.984 --> 29:30.290
And so--yeah, how did that work?

29:30.333 --> 29:32.988
I mean, just being
in the social media world.

29:33.032 --> 29:34.598
I started off with my nose,

29:34.642 --> 29:36.470
so I didn't like that I had
the little bump in my nose,

29:36.513 --> 29:38.254
so I would always
edit it out.

29:38.298 --> 29:39.647
- Yeah, you have a cute nose.
- Yeah.

29:39.690 --> 29:41.518
Um, then I fixed my nose,
and then the next thing

29:41.562 --> 29:43.477
I had a problem with
was my stomach

29:43.520 --> 29:45.479
and my fat rolls, so...
- Okay.

29:45.522 --> 29:47.698
That's why I kinda started
with the lipo.

29:47.742 --> 29:48.830
Okay.

29:48.874 --> 29:50.136
And I was not happy
with the results.

29:50.179 --> 29:52.660
- Why?
- He did really well down here.

29:52.703 --> 29:54.749
But there was still, like,
a lot of fat here,

29:54.793 --> 29:57.665
so all those rolls were
still there.

29:57.708 --> 29:59.232
My back was, like,
still had rolls.

29:59.275 --> 30:00.450
Okay.

30:00.494 --> 30:02.539
So I did the first one
in February,

30:02.583 --> 30:03.714
beginning of February,

30:03.758 --> 30:07.718
and then I had the second lipo
in June.

30:07.762 --> 30:11.157
Four months later,
you had a revisional lipo?

30:11.200 --> 30:12.419
- Yeah.
- Okay.

30:12.462 --> 30:14.943
And then finally,
I went back in October.

30:14.987 --> 30:16.684
- Another lipo?
- Yeah.

30:16.727 --> 30:19.078
Three lipos in the same area
in eight months?

30:19.121 --> 30:20.514
Yeah.

30:20.557 --> 30:21.994
In general,
you should probably wait

30:22.037 --> 30:24.387
at least a year before having
revisional liposuction

30:24.431 --> 30:27.303
because if you don't wait
long enough

30:27.347 --> 30:30.045
for all of the inflammation
to subside,

30:30.089 --> 30:34.093
you're risking severe scarring
and contraction that can

30:34.136 --> 30:37.183
give you very significant
contour irregularities.

30:37.226 --> 30:38.880
- Now I have all this extra skin.
- Yeah.

30:38.924 --> 30:41.665
It's folding still.
He also left me

30:41.709 --> 30:43.885
with really bad scarring, too.
- We saw that.

30:43.929 --> 30:45.713
- I need to fix it.
- All right, and so--

30:45.756 --> 30:46.975
You guys need to tell me
what to do.

30:47.019 --> 30:48.237
All right.

30:48.281 --> 30:51.632
Okay,
so the big concern today is

30:51.675 --> 30:53.852
are the nipples
and areolas alive?

30:53.895 --> 30:57.768
So we're looking for pink
in the areolas and the nipples.

30:57.812 --> 31:00.206
Final answer is?

31:00.249 --> 31:02.556
Take a look at her columella.

31:02.599 --> 31:05.515
Right here.
It looks a little bit grayish.

31:05.559 --> 31:08.910
Oh, sh--. This is exactly what
I was worried about.

31:08.954 --> 31:11.957
I just wanna poke it.

31:14.437 --> 31:16.962
<i>♪ I wanna be perfect</i>

31:17.005 --> 31:20.139
All right, so do me a favor.
Stand up for a sec.

31:20.182 --> 31:23.707
These are the two scars
that they did as access ports

31:23.751 --> 31:25.709
for the liposuction, right?
- Yes.

31:25.753 --> 31:29.017
So this looks like it's fat,
but this is loose skin.

31:29.061 --> 31:32.325
You've basically had every
fat cell suctioned out of you

31:32.368 --> 31:33.935
that you possible can.
- But I still feel like

31:33.979 --> 31:36.372
there's something there,
and I guess it is the skin.

31:36.416 --> 31:38.940
It's the skin folding
on itself.

31:38.984 --> 31:40.855
So here's the thing.

31:40.899 --> 31:44.380
Let's talk about the possible
options to correct this, okay?

31:44.424 --> 31:48.428
Because if someone like you
had more liposuction,

31:48.471 --> 31:52.823
that's this. Imagine that you
had this level of scarring.

31:52.867 --> 31:54.042
Oh.

31:54.086 --> 31:55.826
This is a patient
that I fixed before.

31:55.870 --> 31:57.916
- You do not want that.
- Whoa.

31:57.959 --> 31:59.047
It's like someone
pinched and twists.

31:59.091 --> 32:01.180
- Yeah.
- You know what it is?

32:01.223 --> 32:03.530
It's because the blood supply
to the skin

32:03.573 --> 32:08.361
underneath the tissue
has been depleted so much,

32:08.404 --> 32:12.626
that when it's healing,
it's basically dying slightly.

32:12.669 --> 32:16.499
I think we can agree, right,
no more liposuction.

32:16.543 --> 32:18.066
That's a--That's a "Eee-ee."

32:18.110 --> 32:19.938
That's an absolute "Eee-ee."

32:19.981 --> 32:22.288
Oh, my.
It's stuck in my head now.

32:22.331 --> 32:26.074
I cannot, like, undo that...
eee-eee-eee!

32:26.118 --> 32:28.772
So obviously,
when you have loose skin,

32:28.816 --> 32:30.644
it's like having sheets
in your bed that are loose.

32:30.687 --> 32:34.735
How do you get rid
of loose sheets in the bed?

32:34.778 --> 32:36.215
You make the bed.

32:36.258 --> 32:38.260
The surgical equivalent of that
is make a big incision

32:38.304 --> 32:40.088
all the way across the abdomen,

32:40.132 --> 32:41.524
lift up the covers,
pull it down,

32:41.568 --> 32:43.004
and cut off the excess.

32:43.048 --> 32:44.484
That's acceptable
if you've had kids

32:44.527 --> 32:46.529
and you have very loose skin.
- Right.

32:46.573 --> 32:50.838
But young, perfect body
like yours, unacceptable.

32:50.881 --> 32:55.538
The other way is something
that Dr. Nassif is very into.

32:55.582 --> 32:57.323
So there's more
of a minimally invasive way...

32:57.366 --> 32:59.455
- Mm-hmm.
- ...called Renuvion,

32:59.499 --> 33:01.022
which is a combination
of radio frequency

33:01.066 --> 33:03.024
and some helium gas.
- Mm-hmm.

33:03.068 --> 33:05.113
So you're getting kind of
a combo of both.

33:05.157 --> 33:07.637
I would actually go through
those incisions,

33:07.681 --> 33:09.465
use those incisions,
tie up whatever you have to.

33:09.509 --> 33:10.858
- And then fix these scars.
- And then cut up those scars.

33:10.901 --> 33:14.166
- Oh.
- You can get a nice result.

33:14.209 --> 33:16.603
- Yeah.
- Good enough to make you happy,

33:16.646 --> 33:20.433
I think, and wait probably about
a good six months from now.

33:20.476 --> 33:21.782
That's a very good point.

33:21.825 --> 33:25.003
You need to let the body
chill out.

33:25.046 --> 33:27.222
- You get it, right?
- I get it.

33:27.266 --> 33:28.484
What do you think about this?
You good with this?

33:28.528 --> 33:30.486
I think that she needs
to lay low.

33:30.530 --> 33:32.010
- You're gonna lay low, right?
- Lay low. Go--

33:32.053 --> 33:33.663
- Lay low.
- Go play some golf, huh?

33:33.707 --> 33:35.013
Yeah.

33:35.056 --> 33:37.711
I'm the type of person that when
I want something,

33:37.754 --> 33:39.321
I want it right now.

33:39.365 --> 33:43.499
But I'm so, so thankful
for Dr. Nassif and Dr. Dubrow

33:43.543 --> 33:45.849
for giving me that information
and that advice.

33:45.893 --> 33:47.373
I'm definitely gonna take it.

33:47.416 --> 33:50.245
I do not want any more
problems moving forward.

33:50.289 --> 33:52.030
Okay, let me ask you a question.
Let's say if Brittany came home,

33:52.073 --> 33:54.075
and she wanted to bring
some hot girl home.

33:54.119 --> 33:55.555
- Ooh.
- Oh!

33:55.598 --> 33:58.079
- Suddenly we're a swinger.
- That's swinging.

33:58.123 --> 33:59.167
- That is swinging.
- I gotta think about it.

33:59.211 --> 34:00.560
You're gonna think about it.

34:06.218 --> 34:09.134
- Hi.
- Hello, Miss Edna.

34:09.177 --> 34:10.961
All right, put your head back
for us. Okay.

34:11.005 --> 34:13.877
So...

34:18.360 --> 34:21.102
Can I have a Q-tip?
Would you mind?

34:21.146 --> 34:22.756
I wanna look at something

34:22.799 --> 34:24.279
in the back of her graft.

34:24.323 --> 34:27.326
Oh, sh--. This is exactly
what I was worried about.

34:27.369 --> 34:29.719
Take a look at her columella.

34:29.763 --> 34:32.635
Right here,
it looks a little bit grayish.

34:32.679 --> 34:35.203
We don't have a small needle,
right?

34:35.247 --> 34:36.813
So I have to make sure
that lives.

34:36.857 --> 34:38.163
Otherwise,
if that kind of doesn't,

34:38.206 --> 34:40.382
then we have to do
some more work.

34:40.426 --> 34:41.557
I just wanna do
one little thing.

34:41.601 --> 34:42.819
I just wanna poke it.

34:42.863 --> 34:45.518
The reason why I'm poking
Edna's columella--

34:45.561 --> 34:46.823
to see if it bleeds.

34:46.867 --> 34:49.957
Bleeding is a good thing.
If it doesn't bleed,

34:50.000 --> 34:53.221
that means we have a lack
of blood supply,

34:53.265 --> 34:57.399
and if that continues,
Edna's columella could die.

35:11.196 --> 35:13.241
- There she goes.
- Oh, yeah. There you go.

35:13.285 --> 35:14.373
- You're good. You're good.
- All right.

35:14.416 --> 35:17.767
- You're good.
- Ah.

35:17.811 --> 35:20.205
Well, it's bleeding, all right.
That's good. That's good news.

35:25.993 --> 35:30.084
I'm gonna fight this to recover
every step of the way.

35:30.128 --> 35:31.433
I'm gonna be healed 100%.

35:31.477 --> 35:33.087
I'm gonna do everything I can,

35:33.131 --> 35:36.134
a little hyperbaric oxygen just
to make sure that blood flow

35:36.177 --> 35:38.266
is going perfect.
- Okay.

35:38.310 --> 35:40.529
The color, like,
the tattoo situation...

35:40.573 --> 35:44.272
Yeah, that's later on.
No, but you gotta heal first.

35:44.316 --> 35:45.665
It's gonna be good, really good.

35:45.708 --> 35:47.014
- Take great care of you.
- Like beyond expectations.

35:47.057 --> 35:48.755
- You're gonna be happy.
- It's good to see you.

35:48.798 --> 35:50.844
- All right, see you guys later.
- Yeah. Thank you.

35:50.887 --> 35:51.845
Thank you.

35:54.674 --> 35:56.110
- Hello, young lady.
- How do you feel?

35:56.154 --> 35:58.460
Kinda like somebody beat me
across the chest,

35:58.504 --> 36:00.201
but other than that...
- Kinda what happened, yeah.

36:00.245 --> 36:04.814
Okay, so you had had
that crease and that pull

36:04.858 --> 36:07.643
for so long,

36:07.687 --> 36:12.213
cranking on the--on your
implants, that it left...

36:12.257 --> 36:13.997
- Oh, my goodness.
- ...a permanent crease in here.

36:14.041 --> 36:16.478
- Oh, my God.
- Isn't that crazy?

36:16.522 --> 36:18.001
- I've never seen that.
- Is that right?

36:18.045 --> 36:19.002
From constant
muscle contraction?

36:19.046 --> 36:20.439
Yeah, etched in the silicone.

36:20.482 --> 36:22.136
You really
had never seen that before?

36:22.180 --> 36:24.051
- No.
- Nobody knows how strong I am.

36:24.094 --> 36:25.531
See? That's my superhuman power.

36:25.574 --> 36:29.665
My muscles--they just creased
'em right into--in half.

36:29.709 --> 36:32.451
Okay,
so the big concern today is

36:32.494 --> 36:34.670
once now that I've lifted
everything up,

36:34.714 --> 36:37.412
are the nipples and areolas
alive?

36:37.456 --> 36:39.066
So why don't we get a look?
Okay.

36:39.109 --> 36:41.503
- You wanna take that off there?
- Yeah.

36:41.547 --> 36:43.244
There you go.

36:43.288 --> 36:49.337
All right. So...
So we're looking for pink

36:49.381 --> 36:53.472
in the areolas and the nipples,
okay?

36:53.515 --> 36:58.041
Very pink.
And the final answer is...

36:58.085 --> 37:00.087
very pink.

37:00.130 --> 37:01.262
Look at that. Isn't that great?

37:01.306 --> 37:02.350
- Look at this crease.
- You see this?

37:02.394 --> 37:05.223
- Yeah. <i>
- Excelente, señor.</i>

37:05.266 --> 37:07.137
Wow. That's the first time
I've seen my nipples

37:07.181 --> 37:09.357
whenever I look down, 'cause
they've always been, like...

37:09.401 --> 37:10.880
- Right?
- ...Snoopy-nosed off, so it's--

37:10.924 --> 37:12.317
- Yeah.
- It's new.

37:12.360 --> 37:14.057
It's a crazy thought that
I don't have to worry

37:14.101 --> 37:15.885
about it ever again.

37:15.929 --> 37:19.411
Dr. Dubrow's been so kind
and empathetic and reassuring,

37:19.454 --> 37:22.501
that I feel so good
being in his hands,

37:22.544 --> 37:24.503
and now the outcome of it,
I just--

37:24.546 --> 37:26.374
I couldn't ask
for anything more.

37:26.418 --> 37:29.290
Okay. So all you have to do
is heal...

37:29.334 --> 37:30.596
- Okay.
- ...and relax

37:30.639 --> 37:32.032
and take it easy,
take your pain pills

37:32.075 --> 37:33.207
and your antibiotics, okay?
- All right. Sounds good.

37:33.251 --> 37:34.861
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

37:34.904 --> 37:38.256
I'm excited. I really did forget
what normal boobs looked like.

37:38.299 --> 37:39.953
- Yeah.
- So weird to think, like,

37:39.996 --> 37:41.302
to look down and see...
I'm just gonna get emotional

37:41.346 --> 37:44.305
because, you know,
whatever, but...

37:44.349 --> 37:45.828
They look great.

37:45.872 --> 37:47.482
I haven't cried this whole time.
It's not gonna happen now.

37:49.049 --> 37:50.790
I wanna cry 'cause it looks
so good.

37:50.833 --> 37:52.008
Yeah, you've been through a lot.

37:52.052 --> 37:52.922
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

37:52.966 --> 37:55.316
Good job.

37:55.360 --> 37:59.755
Since I was a baby,
I go through hell with this.

37:59.799 --> 38:02.802
It feels incredible to have
my dream

38:02.845 --> 38:04.499
and my father's dream come true.

38:04.543 --> 38:05.892
Looking back after everything
I've been through

38:05.935 --> 38:08.329
with my first two surgeries,
for the first time,

38:08.373 --> 38:10.810
I have the confidence to say
I feel pretty.

38:10.853 --> 38:14.596

- 'Cause I'm really short, so...

38:26.782 --> 38:28.349
That is cute, though.

38:28.393 --> 38:29.872
Looking back after everything
I've been through

38:29.916 --> 38:33.267
with my first two surgeries,
from a wild ketamine trip

38:33.311 --> 38:36.792
to a talking bird being around
for my second surgery,

38:36.836 --> 38:38.707
for the first time in my life,

38:38.751 --> 38:41.188
I have the confidence to say
I feel pretty.

38:41.231 --> 38:43.408
Mom, you would totally
wear this.

38:43.451 --> 38:44.931
Oh, my God. It's a blazer!

38:44.974 --> 38:46.628
You know that's right up
my alley.

38:46.672 --> 38:47.977
If I were describing
my new breasts,

38:48.021 --> 38:50.066
it really feels like
somebody just plucked them

38:50.110 --> 38:52.286
off of a mannequin
and put them on my chest.

38:52.330 --> 38:53.766
They're beautiful.

38:53.809 --> 38:55.376
I'm like, these are mine?
Are these... These are mine?

38:55.420 --> 38:56.943

38:56.986 --> 38:58.379

I am super jealous that you
don't have to wear a bra.

39:04.994 --> 39:06.822
- I know!
- So that looks fantastic.

39:06.866 --> 39:08.302
I've never been able to do this
in my life.

39:08.346 --> 39:09.651
No.

39:09.695 --> 39:12.480
I legitimately
just put the dress on.

39:12.524 --> 39:13.960
It was so nice not to have
to worry about, um,

39:14.003 --> 39:15.788
how I was gonna, like,
tape myself in there...

39:15.831 --> 39:18.094
- Uh-huh.
- ...or hide the lumps.

39:18.138 --> 39:21.010
Before my surgery,
I had some janky boobs.

39:21.054 --> 39:23.012
I had a double bubble
on both sides,

39:23.056 --> 39:26.407
and my skin was
just hanging over the top

39:26.451 --> 39:28.409
of my implants.

39:28.453 --> 39:30.019
It almost felt like there was
something pulling

39:30.063 --> 39:34.589
or kind of ripping inside,
but now thanks to Dr. Dubrow,

39:34.633 --> 39:37.636
my double bubble is gone
along with all that excess skin.

39:37.679 --> 39:39.028
And I no longer feel pain,

39:39.072 --> 39:41.596
so hopefully
any future medical problems

39:41.640 --> 39:42.902
are a thing of the past.

39:42.945 --> 39:46.471
Bye-bye, janky boobs.
Hello, model boobs.

39:46.514 --> 39:47.994
I'm really happy that
you didn't lose your mom

39:48.037 --> 39:49.299
in a boob accident.

39:49.343 --> 39:51.432
It'd be really embarrassing
to say.

39:51.476 --> 39:53.347
Not that I would be dead?

39:53.391 --> 39:54.914
I mean, yeah, of course
I'd care that you were dead,

39:54.957 --> 39:56.437
but imagine having to tell
people that your mom died

39:56.481 --> 39:58.483
in a boob surgery.

39:58.526 --> 40:00.920
I'm so proud of my mom
for facing her fear

40:00.963 --> 40:03.183
of going under during surgery.

40:03.226 --> 40:04.967
She finally did it, and then
she changed so much

40:05.011 --> 40:07.187
in such a short amount of time.

40:07.230 --> 40:08.536
My mom is always wearing
a smile now,

40:08.580 --> 40:09.972
and it looks really good on her.

40:10.016 --> 40:12.845
You guys, these are legit,
just here on their own.

40:12.888 --> 40:14.803
They live here now.

40:14.847 --> 40:16.675
and they're mine.

40:16.718 --> 40:18.503
- That's amazing.
- I know.

40:18.546 --> 40:20.330
Sorry that you guys are having
to hear this talk.

40:20.374 --> 40:24.030
But you wanted to come shopping,
so here we are.

40:24.073 --> 40:27.425
Where's the exit?

40:31.080 --> 40:33.039
You happy with your nose
so far?

40:33.082 --> 40:35.345
Yeah, and I'm breathing
a lot better now.

40:35.389 --> 40:37.696
- You're breathing?
- Oh, yeah.

40:37.739 --> 40:39.437
Edna's columella survived.

40:39.480 --> 40:41.177
It's alive and looks great.

40:41.221 --> 40:45.094
Now we can move on to the next
phase of her transformation,

40:45.138 --> 40:47.662
which is to actually change
the color of her nasal tip skin.

40:47.706 --> 40:51.274
So now we have Ruth, who is
our medical tattoo specialist,

40:51.318 --> 40:55.148
who's gonna perform
some magic on Edna's nose.

40:55.191 --> 40:57.106
All right.

40:57.150 --> 40:58.673
- All yours.
- Thank you.

40:58.717 --> 41:01.110
I've done my job.

41:01.154 --> 41:02.851
Okay. Good luck for us.

41:02.895 --> 41:04.418
All right.

41:04.462 --> 41:07.421
This has been
a lifelong journey.

41:07.465 --> 41:10.555
Since I was a baby,
I go through hell with this.

41:10.598 --> 41:14.559
But I always believed
that one day I'm gonna

41:14.602 --> 41:15.864
put this past behind me.

41:15.908 --> 41:18.563

41:35.493 --> 41:37.320
My new nose make me
feel beautiful,

41:37.364 --> 41:39.540
make me feel the woman
I've been looking for

41:39.584 --> 41:40.628
for a long time.

41:40.672 --> 41:41.890
I really like how
your nose looks.

41:41.934 --> 41:43.718
Like, they did
a really good job.

41:43.762 --> 41:46.460
It matches your skin tone now.

41:46.504 --> 41:50.464
It's perfect, the way it was
before, this one is 100%.

41:50.508 --> 41:52.466
- It's good.
- It fits your face.

41:52.510 --> 41:53.728
Before my surgery,

41:53.772 --> 41:57.166
a flesh-eating bacteria
destroyed my nose.

41:57.210 --> 41:58.385
The shape was not normal,

41:58.428 --> 42:01.214
and the color of the tip
was very dark.

42:01.257 --> 42:05.131
I also had hair
growing out of it.

42:05.174 --> 42:07.612
I felt cut off
from outside world,

42:07.655 --> 42:09.570
but now thanks to Dr. Nassif,

42:09.614 --> 42:13.487
the shape of my nose
has been restored.

42:13.531 --> 42:15.794
The color now match the rest
of my face,

42:15.837 --> 42:18.492
and most of the hair
has been removed.

42:18.536 --> 42:21.800
I feel like I can finally leave
out of my house

42:21.843 --> 42:23.758
without people judging me.

42:23.802 --> 42:28.067
Now I can live free
for the first time in my life.

42:28.110 --> 42:30.417
Now we can do a lot of stuff.

42:30.460 --> 42:33.159
I personally wanna go
on vacations.

42:33.202 --> 42:34.900
- Vacations?
- Like go to new places

42:34.943 --> 42:37.337
that we, like,
haven't visited at all.

42:37.380 --> 42:38.991
Yeah, but we can go
to Portugal.

42:39.034 --> 42:40.514
We can go to Cape Verde.

42:40.558 --> 42:43.299
Florida, Miami.
I always wanted to go to Italy.

42:43.343 --> 42:45.040
I personally wanna give
a big thanks

42:45.084 --> 42:47.086
to Dr. Nassif and Dr. Dubrow
because

42:47.129 --> 42:50.045
he literally made my mom
and my grandpa's,

42:50.089 --> 42:53.309
like, dream come true
of fixing my mom's nose.

42:53.353 --> 42:55.573
He really gave her, like,
a second chance at life.

42:55.616 --> 42:56.878
Mm-hmm.
