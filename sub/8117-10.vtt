WEBVTT

00:16.117 --> 00:18.186
That's it.

00:18.219 --> 00:19.620
Portal Terminus.

00:19.653 --> 00:21.689
You came through it
the day you got here.

00:21.722 --> 00:23.557
I don't remember.

00:23.591 --> 00:26.160
Then again, it was
pretty much a blur.

00:26.194 --> 00:29.930
One minute I was in 2149,
the next...

00:29.963 --> 00:32.433
I was here.

00:32.466 --> 00:34.268
Hope Plaza sent it
through in pieces

00:34.302 --> 00:36.737
after the Fourth Pilgrimage.

00:36.770 --> 00:39.273
Some assembly required.

00:39.307 --> 00:41.409
Before we got it,
there was no way of knowing

00:41.442 --> 00:43.311
where the Fracture
would spit people out.

00:43.344 --> 00:46.647
Second Pilgrimage ended up about
eight klicks north of here.

00:46.680 --> 00:49.617
Third Pilgrimage, they
landed smack in the middle

00:49.650 --> 00:50.751
of Arrowpoint Lake.

00:50.784 --> 00:52.620
That was fun.

00:52.653 --> 00:54.655
So this thing fixes
the portal on our end, huh?

00:54.688 --> 00:57.024
You're not going to ask me
how it works, are you?

00:57.057 --> 00:58.626
Nah...
Good.

00:58.659 --> 01:01.495
I'm really not in the mood
to pretend I know.

01:01.529 --> 01:06.066
The Eleventh Pilgrimage is due
here in a matter of days.

01:06.100 --> 01:08.068
I want that Sixer spy
locked in the brig

01:08.102 --> 01:09.670
before the new colonists
get here.

01:09.703 --> 01:10.804
How's that coming?

01:10.838 --> 01:13.474
Interviews still in progress.
There's still a few left.

01:13.507 --> 01:17.511
Actually, uh...
I need a word with Riley.

01:17.545 --> 01:18.712
Fair enough.

01:18.746 --> 01:21.915
I'm gonna head in. Gotta
dispatch the afternoon patrols.

01:23.016 --> 01:24.618
Everybody clear on their orders?

01:24.652 --> 01:25.386
Sir, yes, sir!

01:25.419 --> 01:27.955
Eyes on the portal
round the clock.

01:27.988 --> 01:29.890
Any activity,
I want to know ASAP.

01:29.923 --> 01:32.193
Riley, step out.

01:32.226 --> 01:34.061
Sheriff wants a word with you.

01:34.094 --> 01:35.596
What are you
standing around for?

01:35.629 --> 01:38.166
Sheriff. What can I do
for you? As you know,

01:38.199 --> 01:40.534
some evidence that may have
identified the spy

01:40.568 --> 01:42.536
was destroyed in the infirmary
the other night,

01:42.570 --> 01:45.139
and I need to question
everyone who had access.

01:45.173 --> 01:47.208
You understand?
Of course. Ask away.

01:47.241 --> 01:49.577
Okay. You checked into
the infirmary that night.

01:49.610 --> 01:50.811
Why?

01:50.844 --> 01:54.815
Fresh squashed my thumb
in the door of a rover.

01:54.848 --> 01:56.049
I said I was sorry.

01:56.083 --> 01:58.051
But, thanks to your wife,

01:58.085 --> 01:59.853
it's fully operational.

01:59.887 --> 02:01.322
Good.

02:01.355 --> 02:02.823
Well, did you see anyone...

02:02.856 --> 02:06.059
Or anything... unusual in
the infirmary that night?

02:06.093 --> 02:08.662
Uh, just staff, patients,

02:08.696 --> 02:11.064
family members...

02:11.098 --> 02:12.800
Just like any other night.

02:12.833 --> 02:13.967
All right.

02:14.001 --> 02:15.736
That's all I need.

02:15.769 --> 02:17.638
Okay.

02:17.671 --> 02:19.072
Skye.

02:19.106 --> 02:20.808
Appreciate you coming in.

02:20.841 --> 02:23.344
No problem. Getting me
out of construction duty.

02:25.179 --> 02:26.780
Rough work?

02:26.814 --> 02:28.416
Brutal.

02:28.449 --> 02:29.793
I volunteer before
every Pilgrimage,

02:29.817 --> 02:32.186
and I always end up looking
like I took a midnight swim

02:32.220 --> 02:33.487
in a lake full of xiphs.

02:33.521 --> 02:37.291
Thursday, between 9:00 and
11:00 a.m., where were you?

02:37.325 --> 02:41.094
The spy tried contacting
the Sixers that morning,

02:41.128 --> 02:43.130
so I need to know
where everyone was.

02:43.163 --> 02:47.067
Oh. I was with, uh... Josh.

02:47.100 --> 02:48.068
Oh, yeah?

02:48.101 --> 02:50.338
What were you guys up to?

02:53.374 --> 02:55.976
What you say can and
will be used against you.

02:56.009 --> 02:58.379
We were at my house.

02:58.412 --> 03:00.748
On the porch. Um, I...

03:00.781 --> 03:03.617
I was trying to teach him how to
play chess. Oh, yeah? How did he do?

03:03.651 --> 03:06.220
Diamond in the rough?
But I think he has potential.

03:06.254 --> 03:07.154
Ain't that the truth.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.490
All right, well...

03:09.523 --> 03:11.124
if you see
anything suspicious...

03:11.158 --> 03:12.226
I'll let you know.

03:12.260 --> 03:13.761
Great.
Okay.

03:13.794 --> 03:17.665
Don't think this gets you
out of construction duty.

03:27.074 --> 03:28.709
Josh...

03:28.742 --> 03:29.910
I'm sorry.

03:29.943 --> 03:31.011
Is this bothering you?

03:31.044 --> 03:32.680
How about now?

03:34.782 --> 03:37.050
You know what?
I'm just going to ignore

03:37.084 --> 03:38.094
your desperate
cry for attention.

03:38.118 --> 03:39.953
Okay.

03:41.322 --> 03:43.190
What just happened?

03:43.223 --> 03:45.393
Josh, did you do something?

03:45.426 --> 03:47.495
Why do you always have to
blame everything on me?

03:47.528 --> 03:49.330
Because everything
is usually your fault.

03:49.363 --> 03:51.599
It's my plex.

03:57.971 --> 03:59.206
You blew your core.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.775
Mine died last week.

04:03.143 --> 04:05.112
Hey.

04:05.145 --> 04:06.814
Mom, my world just ended.

04:06.847 --> 04:08.982
She just needs a new core.
A promethium core?

04:09.016 --> 04:11.385
Well, you might have to wait
till the Eleventh gets here.

04:11.419 --> 04:13.153
But I have everything
on my plex.

04:13.186 --> 04:15.222
My-My diaries, my homework,

04:15.255 --> 04:16.324
my music, my books...

04:16.357 --> 04:18.024
My whole life!
Sucks for you.

04:18.058 --> 04:20.861
Maddy, promethium's a highly
specialized piece of technology.

04:20.894 --> 04:22.639
It's not like we can
just walk down the street

04:22.663 --> 04:24.332
and get you a new one, you know?

04:24.365 --> 04:26.767
And there's a colony-wide
shortage as it is.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.645
I don't know, maybe you can
scrounge one up from somewhere,

04:28.669 --> 04:31.180
but for now, I think you're just
going to have to make do, okay?

04:31.204 --> 04:32.473
Who wants lunch?

04:33.273 --> 04:35.175
Uh, can't. Gotta go to work.

04:36.977 --> 04:38.312
Try Casey Durwin.

04:38.346 --> 04:40.314
He might be able
to help you out.

04:40.348 --> 04:42.550
Just bring something
to trade, okay?

04:49.189 --> 04:51.859
Oh. Josh, hey!

04:51.892 --> 04:53.126
Hey.

04:53.160 --> 04:54.362
Where you headed?
Ditch duty?

04:54.395 --> 04:56.397
New apprenticeship.
Auto Bay.

04:56.430 --> 04:59.733
I wanted to ask you something.

04:59.767 --> 05:01.602
Shoot. Heads up.

05:04.037 --> 05:07.040
Uh, so I just got done talking
to your dad and, um...

05:07.074 --> 05:09.209
if he asks you where
you were last Thursday,

05:09.242 --> 05:11.579
could you just say that you
were playing chess at my place?

05:11.612 --> 05:13.447
Why would I say that?

05:13.481 --> 05:15.816
Because I am asking you to?

05:18.051 --> 05:19.353
What were you really doing?

05:19.387 --> 05:21.121
Stuff.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.756
Like?

05:24.458 --> 05:25.493
It's stupid.

05:25.526 --> 05:27.761
Skye, it's me.

05:30.197 --> 05:33.634
I was pinching some copper
tubing from maintenance.

05:33.667 --> 05:36.236
And by "pinching"
I mean "borrow."

05:36.269 --> 05:40.708
And by "borrow," I mean
I will give it back eventually.

05:40.741 --> 05:41.575
Happy?

05:41.609 --> 05:43.644
Are you making a new still?

05:43.677 --> 05:46.113
Is this one of Hunter's
brilliant ideas?

05:46.146 --> 05:47.681
Something like that.

05:49.316 --> 05:51.719
Right.

05:51.752 --> 05:53.721
So... will you cover for me?

05:53.754 --> 05:55.456
You're asking me
to lie to my dad.

05:55.489 --> 05:57.458
Your dad's looking
for a Sixer spy.

05:57.491 --> 05:59.259
Unless you think it's me and

05:59.292 --> 06:01.771
I've just been fooling everybody...
I know you're not a spy, Skye.

06:01.795 --> 06:04.998
Okay, so what's the big deal?

06:08.536 --> 06:10.303
Sure. No problem.

06:10.337 --> 06:11.639
Thank you.

06:11.672 --> 06:13.841
I knew I could trust you.

07:25.412 --> 07:26.680
Intel.

07:30.618 --> 07:32.953
You're welcome.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.363
Hey, Mom.

07:43.396 --> 07:44.665
Bucket.

07:44.698 --> 07:46.333
My sweet Bucket.

07:46.366 --> 07:48.268
I've been worried.
It's been a week.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.237
I know. Sorry.

07:50.270 --> 07:51.071
I worry.

07:51.104 --> 07:53.373
You know I worry.
I can't help myself.

07:53.406 --> 07:55.543
I know.

07:56.276 --> 07:58.178
Have they been
feeding you okay?

08:01.682 --> 08:04.552
I'll try to come by more often.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.221
I brought you some food.

08:10.524 --> 08:13.126
Where'd you get that blanket?

08:13.160 --> 08:15.596
Hello.

08:15.629 --> 08:17.330
Who are you?

08:17.364 --> 08:18.331
Bucket, it's all right.

08:18.365 --> 08:19.600
This is...

08:19.633 --> 08:21.101
Lucas Taylor.
The honor's mine.

08:21.134 --> 08:23.403
You're Taylor's son?

08:23.436 --> 08:26.506
Yeah. I've been told
I have his eyes.

08:26.540 --> 08:28.041
You're supposed to be missing.

08:28.075 --> 08:30.110
You found me.

08:35.082 --> 08:37.717
What do you want?

08:38.385 --> 08:40.721
I want us to be friends.

08:40.754 --> 08:44.256
Your mother and I
are friends. Right, Deb?

08:44.291 --> 08:45.859
Lucas brought the blanket.

08:45.893 --> 08:48.596
It's the least I could do.

08:48.629 --> 08:52.532
Your mother needs her rest.
Can we talk outside?

08:59.640 --> 09:03.043
How sweet.

09:03.076 --> 09:05.278
Mommy doesn't know
you're a spy, does she?

09:12.820 --> 09:13.987
My guess is, she has no idea

09:14.021 --> 09:15.956
what you've had to do
to keep her alive.

09:15.989 --> 09:18.058
Don't talk about my mother.

09:18.091 --> 09:21.128
Why don't we talk about
my father, then?

09:21.161 --> 09:23.263
How is the Great
Commander these days?

09:23.296 --> 09:24.598
Has he walked on water yet?

09:24.632 --> 09:27.167
Raised a man from the...
What do you want?

09:29.169 --> 09:31.071
I have a job for you.

09:31.104 --> 09:31.939
I work for Mira.

09:31.972 --> 09:33.674
And who do you think
she works for?

09:33.707 --> 09:36.710
The Sixers can't complete
their mission without me.

09:36.744 --> 09:38.712
If I need you to do
something, believe me,

09:38.746 --> 09:40.280
Mira will understand.

09:40.313 --> 09:42.282
Do you know what this is?

09:44.551 --> 09:45.786
My life's work.

09:45.819 --> 09:48.321
How to make the time portal
go both ways.

09:48.355 --> 09:50.157
I've almost solved it.

09:50.190 --> 09:51.659
Congratulations.

09:51.692 --> 09:53.326
Thank you.

09:53.360 --> 09:56.063
But the equation needs to
be factored and reconciled.

09:56.096 --> 10:00.333
I could do it by hand, but it'd
take weeks, maybe months.

10:00.367 --> 10:04.838
In Terra Nova, in the Eye,
it would take less than an hour.

10:05.739 --> 10:07.307
You want me to do it.

10:07.340 --> 10:09.342
I'll give you a day.
No.

10:09.376 --> 10:12.145
Information only.
That is my deal with Mira.

10:12.179 --> 10:14.314
Just plug it in.

10:14.347 --> 10:16.249
Let the Eye do the rest.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.951
What if I don't?

10:18.886 --> 10:20.954
It's a long way down.

10:22.489 --> 10:24.491
You'll do it, or...

10:24.524 --> 10:27.027
I'll toss your mother over
the side, and then she'll

10:27.060 --> 10:29.262
find out just how far
down it really is.

10:32.900 --> 10:36.036
You better get moving...

10:36.069 --> 10:37.838
Bucket.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.391
I double-checked the
perimeter, just like you asked.

10:58.425 --> 11:01.795
There's a drainage ditch
out by the AG center.

11:01.829 --> 11:03.406
It's small,
but it wouldn't be impossible

11:03.430 --> 11:04.832
to sneak in and out
that way.

11:04.865 --> 11:07.768
Put a security cam on
it, just in case. Will do.

11:07.801 --> 11:11.071
And Wash, double up on
your west perimeter patrol.

11:11.104 --> 11:12.539
I want eyes on
that tree line.

11:12.572 --> 11:13.673
Will do.
Hey, Dad.

11:13.707 --> 11:14.641
Josh.

11:14.674 --> 11:17.711
Oh, Josh, before I forget...

11:17.745 --> 11:21.248
Last Thursday, between
7:00 and 11:00 a.m.,

11:21.281 --> 11:22.082
where were you?

11:22.115 --> 11:23.616
Uh, playing chess with Skye.

11:23.650 --> 11:26.519
Where?
Her place.

11:26.553 --> 11:28.421
All I needed to know.

11:57.484 --> 12:00.153
Hello?

12:19.840 --> 12:21.074
Activate.

12:41.428 --> 12:42.462
Well?

12:42.495 --> 12:45.332
You're a smart girl.

12:45.365 --> 12:51.738
Okay, say I did have a use
for a frilly green scarf,

12:51.771 --> 12:53.540
an old teddy bear...

12:53.573 --> 12:54.574
Miss Dorothy.

12:54.607 --> 12:55.742
Yeah, and what the heck...?

12:55.775 --> 12:57.644
Abacus... I used to
collect them, but this is

12:57.677 --> 12:59.646
the only one I brought through

12:59.679 --> 13:00.713
the portal with me.

13:00.747 --> 13:02.649
Well, it still
wouldn't be enough

13:02.682 --> 13:03.783
to buy a promethium core.

13:03.817 --> 13:05.919
Look, I bet that this is

13:05.953 --> 13:07.420
the only abacus
on Terra Nova.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.489
With good reason.
Which makes it rare.

13:09.522 --> 13:10.723
Which makes it junk.

13:10.757 --> 13:12.397
One man's trash
is another man's treasure.

13:12.425 --> 13:15.262
Look, I appreciate the hustle,
okay? But the reality is

13:15.295 --> 13:17.464
if you got nothing
to trade, I can't help you.

13:17.497 --> 13:19.499
You see the trick is to...

13:19.532 --> 13:22.502
Damn it. Bum wheel.

13:22.535 --> 13:23.570
What was I saying?

13:23.603 --> 13:24.747
The trick is
to find something...

13:24.771 --> 13:27.540
Yeah, to find something that the
person can't live without.

13:27.574 --> 13:29.009
Then you make the trade.

13:29.042 --> 13:30.878
No one needs an "acubus."
Abacus.

13:30.911 --> 13:31.911
Whatever.

13:33.613 --> 13:34.982
What if I could
get you a wheel?

13:35.015 --> 13:37.985
Well, then, my friend,
we could talk.

13:48.228 --> 13:50.063
Lucas?

14:05.645 --> 14:08.681
Bucket, did it work?

14:08.715 --> 14:10.617
Yeah, I think so.

14:10.650 --> 14:13.921
For your sake and your sweet
mother's sake, I hope so.

14:29.602 --> 14:31.972
Yes, yes.

14:33.206 --> 14:35.976
I knew you could do it.

14:36.743 --> 14:38.711
This is gonna work.

14:38.745 --> 14:41.648
I'm so close.
Just a day or two.

14:41.681 --> 14:44.884
I've seen these before,
out by Snakehead Falls.

14:44.918 --> 14:46.853
And did you tell my father?

14:46.886 --> 14:49.489
No.

14:49.522 --> 14:50.590
Area's off-limits.

14:50.623 --> 14:54.527
He needs to keep our issues
in the family.

14:54.561 --> 14:55.495
The two of us,

14:55.528 --> 14:57.697
we suffer from
a Shakespearean relationship

14:57.730 --> 14:59.732
that borders on Greek tragedy.

14:59.766 --> 15:01.834
Have you always hated him
this much?

15:01.868 --> 15:04.271
No, not always.

15:04.304 --> 15:07.740
It started in 2138, August.

15:07.774 --> 15:10.577
What happened then?

15:10.610 --> 15:14.081
Ask him yourself.

15:15.382 --> 15:19.586
So after the portal opens
both ways, what then?

15:19.619 --> 15:20.587
You'll see.

15:20.620 --> 15:21.688
Now, out, Bucket.

15:21.721 --> 15:22.990
I've work to do.

15:26.726 --> 15:28.695
Don't make me
tell you twice.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.713
Shannon, check this out.

15:46.746 --> 15:47.847
What do you got?

15:47.880 --> 15:49.549
This is footage
from a few hours ago

15:49.582 --> 15:52.485
at that drainage ditch
you told me to put a camera on.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.156
That's Skye.

15:56.189 --> 15:57.357
What's she doing?

15:57.390 --> 15:59.002
I'm sure she's got
a perfectly good reason

15:59.026 --> 16:00.293
to be sneaking out
of Terra Nova

16:00.327 --> 16:02.829
through a drainage ditch
covered in brush thorn.

16:02.862 --> 16:04.597
I'll notify the commander.

16:04.631 --> 16:05.565
Hold on.

16:05.598 --> 16:08.735
I gotta... I gotta
double-check something.

16:19.579 --> 16:20.747
Josh?

16:21.581 --> 16:24.184
Listen, I'm gonna ask
you something,

16:24.217 --> 16:26.986
and I need you to be
honest with me, understand?

16:27.020 --> 16:28.388
Sure.

16:28.421 --> 16:31.324
You weren't with Skye
last Thursday, were you?

16:35.395 --> 16:36.395
No.

16:39.232 --> 16:42.235
You know where
she was?

16:42.269 --> 16:44.104
Yeah, she said that
if you ask,

16:44.137 --> 16:46.039
I should say I was with her.

16:46.073 --> 16:49.042
I didn't think it was
that big of a deal.

16:49.076 --> 16:50.910
I thought you were looking
for a Sixer spy.

16:50.943 --> 16:52.512
What's going on?

16:53.713 --> 16:54.747
Josh...

16:58.251 --> 17:02.122
...you're my son,
and I love you very much...

17:02.155 --> 17:06.858
but don't lie
to me again, okay?

17:06.893 --> 17:08.961
Yeah.

17:08.994 --> 17:09.896
And you're grounded.

17:09.929 --> 17:11.107
Oh, come on!
I've been grounded since

17:11.131 --> 17:12.299
I walked
through the portal.

17:15.435 --> 17:17.470
What's going on?
I found the Sixer mole.

17:17.503 --> 17:21.308
And our son's been lying for her
to help cover her tracks.

17:25.944 --> 17:28.515
I just...

17:30.250 --> 17:31.718
And you're sure it's her?

17:31.751 --> 17:34.154
I've been retracing her
whereabouts for the last week.

17:34.187 --> 17:35.855
Too many holes.

17:35.888 --> 17:38.991
She hasn't been on construction
duty like she said,

17:39.025 --> 17:40.560
plus her alibi
for the morning

17:40.593 --> 17:44.097
the Sixers tried to make
contact doesn't check out.

17:44.131 --> 17:47.100
I'm sorry.

17:47.134 --> 17:49.402
Me, too.

17:54.207 --> 17:56.909
I got a man inside
the Sixer camp.

17:56.943 --> 18:01.181
I'm gonna get to him and see
if he can confirm that it's her.

18:01.214 --> 18:03.616
Who's your man?

18:09.021 --> 18:10.457
Curran.

18:10.490 --> 18:13.893
After I banished him,
I thought I'd make use of him

18:13.926 --> 18:17.130
give him the chance to earn
his way back to the colony.

18:17.164 --> 18:20.133
Well, in the meantime,

18:20.167 --> 18:22.769
I'll get Wash
to bring Skye in.

18:22.802 --> 18:23.836
No.

18:25.205 --> 18:27.440
I've got a better idea.

18:38.851 --> 18:40.887
Your mind's not on the game.

18:45.057 --> 18:47.794
Didn't see that one
coming, did you?

18:47.827 --> 18:50.197
No, I sure didn't.

18:50.863 --> 18:52.031
Commander.

18:52.064 --> 18:54.000
What's the word on
the supply convoy?

18:54.033 --> 18:55.268
Almost ready to leave.

18:55.302 --> 18:57.770
Pack me out a rover
with a .50-cal gunner.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.182
I know Devil's Canyon
better than most.

18:59.206 --> 19:02.942
I want those sonic mines
at Outpost Three ASAP.

19:02.975 --> 19:04.444
I'll run point on this myself.

19:04.477 --> 19:05.445
Yes, sir.

19:05.478 --> 19:07.247
Convoy'll be ready to leave
in an hour.

19:12.685 --> 19:14.221
Your move.

19:19.959 --> 19:21.961
Hey.
Hi.

19:21.994 --> 19:22.995
You working?

19:23.029 --> 19:25.198
Off in a few hours.
Why?

19:25.232 --> 19:26.633
I need a wheel.

19:26.666 --> 19:27.967
A wheel?

19:28.000 --> 19:30.036
Yeah, for Casey Durwin.
Why?

19:30.069 --> 19:31.671
If I find him a wheel
for his chair,

19:31.704 --> 19:34.541
then he'll give me a
promethium core for my plex.

19:34.574 --> 19:37.043
I haven't done any homework
or read in almost 24 hours,

19:37.076 --> 19:38.711
and I'm going slightly insane.

19:38.745 --> 19:41.514
Okay, wait. You haven't done
homework in 24 hours?

19:41.548 --> 19:44.016
Are you, are you okay?
You need to sit down?

19:44.050 --> 19:45.084
Mark, it's not funny.

19:45.117 --> 19:47.119
Okay, um...

19:47.153 --> 19:48.488
Uh, come back in an hour.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.390
I'll help you find
that wheel, okay?

19:51.123 --> 19:52.559
You're amazing.

19:52.592 --> 19:54.394
Back at ya.

20:06.105 --> 20:08.241
And there she goes.

20:08.275 --> 20:10.477
She took the bait.

20:10.510 --> 20:12.512
Yep.

20:12.545 --> 20:15.448
Once Mira finds out
about the convoy,

20:15.482 --> 20:18.318
she'll be on it with
everything she's got.

20:18.351 --> 20:21.053
We'll be ready for her.

20:21.087 --> 20:22.922
We'll bring her in
if we can.

20:22.955 --> 20:24.056
But one way or the other,

20:24.090 --> 20:26.393
this is gonna end.

20:34.166 --> 20:36.936
Still nothing, Shannon.
You copy?

20:36.969 --> 20:38.137
Yeah, roger that.

20:38.170 --> 20:40.607
All eyes still on you,
and you're clear.

20:40.640 --> 20:44.444
But when they make their move,
we'll be all over them.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.088
Commander, it looks like
we've got movement.

20:56.122 --> 20:57.757
They're coming in behind us.

21:04.163 --> 21:06.399
Talk to me, Shannon.
How many?

21:06.433 --> 21:09.369
I can't get a visual. Stand by.

21:27.219 --> 21:30.222
Commander, visual contact.

21:30.256 --> 21:32.725
These Sixers are 50-foot tall,
gray...

21:35.061 --> 21:37.497
...and very, very hungry.

21:43.370 --> 21:45.805
We gave Mira
a golden opportunity.

21:45.838 --> 21:48.174
It's been hours.

21:48.207 --> 21:49.542
They ain't showing.

21:49.576 --> 21:54.146
I think she must have
spotted you and your team.

21:54.180 --> 21:55.181
I don't think so.

21:55.214 --> 21:58.050
You got another theory,
I sure'd like to hear it.

21:58.084 --> 21:59.719
Maybe Skye didn't tell her.

21:59.752 --> 22:03.255
Well, then why'd she hightail
it out of Terra Nova

22:03.289 --> 22:04.924
the minute she heard
about this convoy?

22:04.957 --> 22:05.925
Think about it.

22:05.958 --> 22:08.094
The Sixers never found
any of our weapons caches.

22:08.127 --> 22:11.431
They've never attacked a convoy
when we really needed it.

22:11.464 --> 22:12.765
She's giving
them intel,

22:12.799 --> 22:15.334
but nothing that would
actually hurt the colony.

22:15.368 --> 22:16.869
Why give them anything at all?

22:18.037 --> 22:21.674
'Cause I think they're
holding something over her.

22:32.184 --> 22:33.219
Mira.

22:33.252 --> 22:34.286
Back so soon?

22:34.320 --> 22:36.355
Just trying to
take care of my mom,

22:36.389 --> 22:38.124
since your people
aren't feeding her.

22:38.157 --> 22:40.159
You know what this is?

22:40.192 --> 22:42.462
Medicine.

22:42.495 --> 22:44.163
Your mother's dose
for the day.

22:44.196 --> 22:45.465
What if a strong wind came

22:45.498 --> 22:47.900
and blew it away?

22:49.569 --> 22:51.313
My spotters say a convoy
went through Devil's Canyon

22:51.337 --> 22:52.639
about an hour ago.

22:52.672 --> 22:55.475
Why the hell
didn't you contact us?

22:55.508 --> 22:57.309
Because I didn't know
about the convoy.

22:57.343 --> 22:58.911
It's your job to know.

23:00.312 --> 23:01.714
Your intel
has been garbage lately.

23:01.748 --> 23:03.683
I'm doing the best I can.

23:03.716 --> 23:04.283
Yeah?

23:04.316 --> 23:05.918
Do better.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.391
Next week?

23:12.425 --> 23:14.494
I'll be here.

23:15.495 --> 23:17.830
I'll have something.

23:31.611 --> 23:34.246
So, how about that trade?

23:36.248 --> 23:37.359
Aren't you the
industrious one?

23:37.383 --> 23:39.318
Well, you know,
I had a little help.

23:39.351 --> 23:40.386
Did a little scavenging

23:42.722 --> 23:45.424
Breaks my heart
to tell you this,

23:45.458 --> 23:47.259
but somebody beat you to it.

23:47.293 --> 23:48.327
What?

23:48.360 --> 23:51.297
They picked up my last
promethium core this morning.

23:51.330 --> 23:54.634
They traded me
a brand-new wheel.

23:56.435 --> 23:58.638
Who bought it?

24:15.187 --> 24:16.388
Tom Boylan?

24:16.422 --> 24:18.390
Who wants to know?

24:18.424 --> 24:20.392
I'm Maddy.

24:20.426 --> 24:21.561
I came for a core.

24:21.594 --> 24:24.864
Because Casey Durwin said that
he sold the last one to you,

24:24.897 --> 24:27.133
and I'm not leaving
until I trade.

24:27.166 --> 24:27.800
A core, eh?

24:27.834 --> 24:30.202
Expensive piece of technology.

24:30.236 --> 24:34.741
Yes, well, I need it for my plex
and my studies and...

24:35.608 --> 24:37.476
I really like to study.

24:37.510 --> 24:39.378
Oh, yeah?
I used to like to study.

24:39.411 --> 24:40.446
Look how far it got me.

24:40.479 --> 24:42.314
How much do you want for it?

24:42.348 --> 24:43.282
More than you've got.

24:43.315 --> 24:44.617
Well, why do you need it?

24:44.651 --> 24:46.294
To run a new set of taps...
Highly necessary.

24:46.318 --> 24:47.554
Now, out!

24:47.587 --> 24:51.490
Because, as you can
see, I am a busy man.

24:51.524 --> 24:53.492
Well, I can help you
with this, you know.

24:53.526 --> 24:54.570
I'm-I'm really good with numbers

24:54.594 --> 24:55.528
and organizing things.

24:55.562 --> 24:56.629
Really?

24:56.663 --> 24:58.430
Yeah, yeah.
I-I even like doing it.

24:58.464 --> 25:01.233
My organizational services
for a core.

25:04.336 --> 25:06.172
Interesting proposal.

25:06.205 --> 25:07.473
Maddy...?
Shannon.

25:07.506 --> 25:09.341
As in Sheriff Shannon?

25:09.375 --> 25:10.643
Yeah, my dad.

25:10.677 --> 25:13.580
So the sheriff's daughter
organizing my books.

25:13.613 --> 25:16.015
Uh... no.

25:16.048 --> 25:17.349
No.

25:17.383 --> 25:18.450
No, thank you.

25:18.484 --> 25:20.052
Did your dad put
you up to this?

25:20.086 --> 25:20.687
No!

25:20.720 --> 25:22.622
I tell you, I tell you what.

25:22.655 --> 25:24.591
I tell you what. How about...

25:24.624 --> 25:26.993
I just give you the core?

25:27.026 --> 25:28.861
What, you're just
giving it to me?

25:28.895 --> 25:30.429
No, I want you to have it.

25:30.462 --> 25:33.165
Just tell your dad what a nice
guy I was giving it to you.

25:33.199 --> 25:34.400
Off you go.

25:34.433 --> 25:35.501
Okay.

25:35.534 --> 25:37.269
It's a little weird.
Yeah.

25:37.303 --> 25:39.005
Thank you.

25:42.642 --> 25:44.176
Would you like a wheel?

25:53.485 --> 25:55.187
I solved it.

25:55.221 --> 25:56.088
It's done.

25:56.122 --> 25:58.858
Thank you, Bucket.

25:58.891 --> 26:02.695
You know how to make
the portal open both ways?

26:02.729 --> 26:04.396
And now everything changes.

26:04.430 --> 26:05.507
What are you talking about?

26:05.531 --> 26:06.666
Hey, why "Bucket"?

26:06.699 --> 26:09.568
I have to know.

26:11.403 --> 26:12.639
I...

26:13.806 --> 26:15.708
When I was little,
I wanted to

26:15.742 --> 26:18.177
be in the army like my dad,

26:18.210 --> 26:21.681
so I used to put a bucket
on my head and...

26:21.714 --> 26:23.549
pretend it was a helmet.

26:23.582 --> 26:24.751
Name kind of stuck.

26:24.784 --> 26:25.818
It suits you.

26:25.852 --> 26:27.920
I've always found
it so strange

26:27.954 --> 26:30.723
why so many people want to be
like their fathers.

26:30.757 --> 26:32.625
Not me.
I just wanted to destroy mine.

26:32.659 --> 26:34.627
Where are you going?

26:34.661 --> 26:36.395
To the portal.

26:36.428 --> 26:37.730
2149 awaits.

26:37.764 --> 26:40.299
There's so much to do,
and not much time.

26:40.332 --> 26:43.736
But I-I wanted to tell you,
before I left,

26:43.770 --> 26:45.705
you shouldn't go back
to Terra Nova.

26:45.738 --> 26:47.039
It's not safe
for you there.

26:47.073 --> 26:49.208
They're coming.

26:49.241 --> 26:50.576
Who?

26:50.609 --> 26:51.778
My employers.

26:51.811 --> 26:54.113
The people who hired the Sixers.

26:54.146 --> 26:55.848
They're gonna take
control of Terra Nova,

26:55.882 --> 26:58.350
and if my father
fights them,

26:58.384 --> 27:00.787
which he will,
they'll burn it to the ground,

27:00.820 --> 27:03.055
with or without
the people in it.

27:03.990 --> 27:05.658
Why would they do that?

27:05.692 --> 27:09.495
Control the past
and you control the future.

27:09.528 --> 27:12.464
Well, Taylor won't
let that happen.

27:12.498 --> 27:15.067
He's a man, not a god.

27:18.604 --> 27:20.873
But don't tell him that.

27:20.907 --> 27:22.709
You'll hurt his feelings.

27:29.916 --> 27:33.285
When the tanks roll in
and my employer starts

27:33.319 --> 27:35.822
stripping this place
into nonexistence,

27:35.855 --> 27:40.592
the commander will
know, finally,

27:40.626 --> 27:42.762
that I beat him.

27:44.596 --> 27:48.735
I've been waiting for this day
since I was 14 years old.

27:48.768 --> 27:51.303
And I have you to thank.

28:03.249 --> 28:06.152
Searched her place,
found these.

28:11.557 --> 28:13.926
They're maintenance
access cards.

28:13.960 --> 28:15.361
They're old ones.
Hacked ones.

28:15.394 --> 28:16.972
She's been using them
a couple times a week

28:16.996 --> 28:18.931
to access Relay Station Nine.

28:18.965 --> 28:20.266
Relay Station Nine...

28:20.299 --> 28:22.668
That's a klick and a half
outside the gates.

28:22.701 --> 28:23.770
What, a meeting place?

28:23.803 --> 28:25.805
Possibly.

28:25.838 --> 28:27.173
Listen, I know it's not much,

28:27.206 --> 28:28.550
but there could be
something out there,

28:28.574 --> 28:31.811
some, some reason behind
why she's doing all this.

28:31.844 --> 28:34.814
I sure hope you're right.

28:34.847 --> 28:37.049
I really hope
there's a reason.

28:37.083 --> 28:40.386
So I can make some sense
out of all of this.

28:40.419 --> 28:42.321
Let's move.

28:44.523 --> 28:45.925
I shouldn't have
helped Lucas,

28:45.958 --> 28:47.927
but I didn't know
what else to do.

28:47.960 --> 28:51.430
And if something happens,
it's my fault.

28:51.463 --> 28:53.800
And something will happen
he said it would.

28:53.833 --> 28:56.903
It's just a matter of time.

28:56.936 --> 28:59.338
He's on his way there now.

28:59.371 --> 29:01.373
Sweetheart, I didn't know.

29:01.407 --> 29:02.775
Why didn't you tell me?

29:02.809 --> 29:04.811
'Cause I didn't
want you to worry.

29:06.678 --> 29:10.116
I don't think I can
do this anymore.

29:10.883 --> 29:13.853
Bucket, look at me.

29:13.886 --> 29:18.925
Skye Alexandria Tate,
you look at me right now.

29:22.694 --> 29:26.765
You don't have
to do this anymore.

29:26.799 --> 29:28.167
What?

29:28.200 --> 29:31.003
You're not doing this anymore.

29:31.037 --> 29:33.806
This has gone
on long enough.

29:33.840 --> 29:35.074
If I had have known,

29:35.107 --> 29:37.944
I would've put an end to it
a long time ago.

29:46.352 --> 29:49.989
You're going to run back
to Terra Nova,

29:50.022 --> 29:52.624
you're going to go
straight to Taylor,

29:52.658 --> 29:55.261
and you tell him
everything you know.

29:55.294 --> 29:58.831
And you are never coming
back here, you understand?

29:58.865 --> 30:00.833
What about you?

30:02.902 --> 30:05.872
I've been sick a long time.

30:05.905 --> 30:07.739
A very long time.

30:07.773 --> 30:09.175
I'm tired.

30:10.843 --> 30:12.178
Mom, please.

30:12.211 --> 30:15.114
You've been such
a strong girl.

30:15.147 --> 30:18.284
You know how proud
your father would've been?

30:19.952 --> 30:23.289
Now, get up... go.

30:24.456 --> 30:26.658
Don't you worry about your mom
I'll be fine.

30:26.692 --> 30:28.560
Go, Skye.

30:28.594 --> 30:30.029
Hurry.

31:25.451 --> 31:28.354
I got something.

31:31.890 --> 31:34.493
Yeah, this belongs to Skye.

31:34.526 --> 31:36.996
I gave her a sonic for
her last birthday.

31:37.029 --> 31:38.430
Damn good shot.

31:39.932 --> 31:41.400
Hands up!

31:41.433 --> 31:42.168
Please don't shoot!

31:42.201 --> 31:44.103
I came here
to warn you.

31:44.136 --> 31:46.072
Put the sonic down.

31:51.143 --> 31:52.378
We know you're the spy.

31:54.046 --> 31:55.047
Give me one good reason

31:55.081 --> 31:56.915
why I shouldn't
lock you away

31:56.949 --> 31:59.218
for the rest of your life.

31:59.251 --> 32:00.987
I wanted to tell you.

32:01.020 --> 32:03.355
I just... the Sixers have my mom!

32:05.257 --> 32:06.892
Your mother's been dead

32:06.925 --> 32:08.995
for the last three years.
No, she's alive!

32:09.028 --> 32:12.098
They-They have a treatment
for Syncillic fever,

32:12.131 --> 32:15.001
and after my dad died,
I snuck her out to their camp,

32:15.034 --> 32:16.168
and Mira said that

32:16.202 --> 32:19.038
she would save her,
if I spied for them.

32:19.071 --> 32:20.272
You have to listen to me.

32:20.306 --> 32:21.940
Lucas finished his calculations.

32:25.111 --> 32:28.114
What do you know about Lucas
and his calculations?

32:28.147 --> 32:29.881
I talked to him,
and he's on his way

32:29.915 --> 32:30.849
to the portal right now.

32:30.882 --> 32:33.419
He's gonna activate it
to make it go both ways.

32:33.452 --> 32:35.330
Why are you just standing
there?! You have to go!

32:35.354 --> 32:37.289
You've been lying to me
for God knows how long.

32:37.323 --> 32:40.959
Why the hell should
I believe anything you say?

32:40.993 --> 32:42.194
I am done lying, Taylor.

32:42.228 --> 32:43.962
I'm done.
Yeah?

32:43.996 --> 32:45.297
What can you say to me

32:45.331 --> 32:47.033
that is gonna convince me

32:47.066 --> 32:49.335
that you ever actually
even talked to my son?!

32:52.071 --> 32:54.573
He, um...

32:54.606 --> 32:57.043
uh, he mentioned 2132.

32:57.076 --> 32:58.910
No, no, no, no, no.

32:58.944 --> 33:00.446
Uh, 2138.

33:00.479 --> 33:03.349
August 2138.

33:16.262 --> 33:18.164
You go straight
to the colony

33:18.197 --> 33:19.374
and wait for us there,
understand?

33:19.398 --> 33:21.867
Of course.

33:21.900 --> 33:24.070
Taylor, I'm sorry.

33:25.304 --> 33:27.306
Dunham, this is Shannon.

33:27.339 --> 33:29.708
Dunham, come in. Over.

33:32.378 --> 33:36.448
Dunham, this is Shannon,
with Commander Taylor.

33:36.482 --> 33:37.983
Dunham, come in.

33:38.016 --> 33:40.986
Dunham, this is Shan...

33:41.019 --> 33:42.421
We're to meet you at... now.

33:42.454 --> 33:45.023
Shannon this is Dunham.
I didn't copy.

33:45.057 --> 33:46.058
Interference on this end.

33:46.092 --> 33:47.093
Go again. Over...

33:49.495 --> 33:53.132
What was that?
The portal.

33:53.165 --> 33:54.866
It's initiating.

33:54.900 --> 33:56.268
I thought the
11th Pilgrimage

33:56.302 --> 33:57.542
wasn't scheduled
till next week.

34:01.407 --> 34:03.709
Riley to Taylor.
Come in.

34:03.742 --> 34:06.478
We have unscheduled
portal activity. Over.

34:08.914 --> 34:11.650
That thing's causing
interference.

34:12.518 --> 34:14.753
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

34:14.786 --> 34:16.822
Get down on the ground!
Now!

34:16.855 --> 34:18.157
You first.

34:59.865 --> 35:01.500
Lucas!

35:01.533 --> 35:04.203
Step away
from the portal.

35:04.236 --> 35:07.005
I'd take it easy with
those guns, if I were you.

35:07.038 --> 35:09.741
I'll say it one more time...
Step away from the portal

35:09.775 --> 35:11.743
or I'll shoot.

35:13.111 --> 35:15.281
No, you won't.

35:15.314 --> 35:17.149
One blast from those sonics

35:17.183 --> 35:18.717
could blow the whole
Fracture apart,

35:18.750 --> 35:21.253
and that would cut you off
from the future for good.

35:21.287 --> 35:22.954
And you wouldn't want that,

35:22.988 --> 35:24.456
would you?

35:25.491 --> 35:29.161
I can't tell you how glad
I am that you're here.

35:29.195 --> 35:33.932
All those nights I spent
out in the jungle,

35:33.965 --> 35:36.435
freezing, starving.

35:36.468 --> 35:38.237
The only thing
that kept me alive

35:38.270 --> 35:39.971
was the thought
of you being here

35:40.005 --> 35:42.508
to see this.
Son...

35:42.541 --> 35:45.211
Don't! Don't call me that!

35:48.647 --> 35:50.316
Listen to me.

35:50.349 --> 35:52.718
There are good people here.
Innocent people.

35:52.751 --> 35:53.752
Think what will happen

35:53.785 --> 35:57.022
to Terra Nova
if you go through with this.

35:57.055 --> 35:58.790
Oh, I know what's
going to happen.

35:58.824 --> 36:01.660
They're going to come and
take you off your throne

36:01.693 --> 36:04.363
and make you watch while they
strip this place and take it

36:04.396 --> 36:06.698
for everything it's worth.

36:06.732 --> 36:09.268
Over my dead body.

36:09.301 --> 36:12.103
Um... that's the spirit.

36:12.137 --> 36:14.306
Go down fighting
for... for a dream.

36:14.340 --> 36:17.809
Some Utopia, and all
that's right and true!

36:17.843 --> 36:19.110
Open your eyes, old man!

36:19.144 --> 36:20.412
It's over!

36:22.714 --> 36:24.182
I beat you.

36:24.216 --> 36:25.484
I won.

36:25.517 --> 36:30.289
Soon you'll be on your knees,
begging me for mercy.

36:30.322 --> 36:32.391
The next time we meet,
I won't be alone.

36:33.625 --> 36:36.262
Lucas!

37:14.766 --> 37:19.037
She's all I have.

37:19.070 --> 37:21.807
And I just...

37:21.840 --> 37:23.709
left her there.

37:23.742 --> 37:27.045
If she told you to go,
then you had to do it.

37:27.078 --> 37:30.349
You did the right thing.

37:39.591 --> 37:43.729
Skye, we need you
in the infirmary right now.

37:52.704 --> 37:54.640
Skye...

37:57.042 --> 37:58.644
Mom!

37:58.677 --> 38:00.011
Bucket.

38:00.045 --> 38:02.113
Mom...

38:02.147 --> 38:03.382
How did you do this?

38:03.415 --> 38:06.084
You have this man to thank.

38:06.117 --> 38:07.486
You remember Curran?

38:10.255 --> 38:12.290
The commander sent word

38:12.324 --> 38:14.059
to get your mother
out of there and...

38:14.092 --> 38:15.527
Curran came through.

38:16.462 --> 38:18.029
This is what the Sixers
were giving her.

38:18.063 --> 38:21.967
They, they never
told me what was in it.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.168
This is good, Skye.

38:23.201 --> 38:24.446
With Malcolm's help,
we should be able

38:24.470 --> 38:26.972
to figure out what it is
and make a synthetic copy.

38:27.005 --> 38:29.040
She's going to be okay.

38:29.074 --> 38:30.509
You hear that?

38:32.243 --> 38:34.079
We should let
your mother sleep now.

38:34.112 --> 38:36.247
All right, you get some rest,
get cleaned up.

38:36.281 --> 38:38.083
My office, first thing
in the morning.

38:38.116 --> 38:40.085
Sir.

38:40.118 --> 38:41.520
Deborah.

38:43.355 --> 38:46.392
I'm mighty glad to see you.

38:53.732 --> 38:55.667
Skye...

38:56.902 --> 38:58.904
Not now.

38:58.937 --> 39:00.939
Give him time.

39:06.445 --> 39:08.847
Any word on the team?

39:08.880 --> 39:11.450
Word from Wash is that
the Sixers' camp is deserted.

39:12.551 --> 39:15.153
They move damn quick,
I'll give Mira that.

39:15.186 --> 39:16.388
As soon as she realized

39:16.422 --> 39:18.424
that Curran had gotten
Deborah out of there,

39:18.457 --> 39:21.627
she knew he'd tip us off
to their location.

39:22.494 --> 39:25.531
Look, uh, I'm a
little surprised

39:25.564 --> 39:28.366
you're allowing a murderer
back in the colony.

39:30.268 --> 39:34.239
Curran killed a man,

39:34.272 --> 39:36.575
but today he saved
a woman's life.

39:36.608 --> 39:39.210
I'm not going to pin
a medal on his chest, but

39:39.244 --> 39:41.747
he's earned himself
a second chance.

39:44.382 --> 39:46.284
You know...

39:46.317 --> 39:48.386
most men don't get
the opportunity

39:48.420 --> 39:52.424
to atone for their mistakes.

39:52.458 --> 39:55.326
Believe me, I know
something about that.

39:55.360 --> 39:57.328
I made a big one,

39:57.362 --> 39:59.297
and from that day to this,

39:59.330 --> 40:01.800
my son has never
let me forget it.

40:01.833 --> 40:03.602
Somalia?

40:11.276 --> 40:13.679
August 2138.

40:15.180 --> 40:17.616
Lucas's mother died...

40:18.383 --> 40:20.519
...because I
couldn't save her.

40:21.587 --> 40:24.289
He's hated me from
that moment on.

40:24.322 --> 40:27.025
You know what?

40:27.058 --> 40:31.497
Some nights... most nights...
I don't blame him one bit.

40:32.397 --> 40:34.365
What happens now?

40:34.399 --> 40:37.168
Now... we fight.

40:37.202 --> 40:41.573
Look, we've got to assume that
Lucas made it through to 2149.

40:41.607 --> 40:46.044
The people who are behind
him and the Sixers...

40:46.878 --> 40:48.780
They're going to
come at us hard

40:48.814 --> 40:50.482
and they're going
to come at us soon.

40:50.516 --> 40:51.693
No matter what they're planning,

40:51.717 --> 40:53.619
the only way to get here
is through Hope Plaza.

40:53.652 --> 40:56.421
That's right...
The 11th Pilgrimage

40:56.454 --> 40:59.157
is a few days away.

40:59.190 --> 41:01.560
Let's make sure
we're ready.

41:11.637 --> 41:12.814
There's a chance
that Lucas got caught

41:12.838 --> 41:14.439
when he arrived
in Hope Plaza, right?

41:14.472 --> 41:16.074
Lucas Taylor is smart, Maddy.

41:16.107 --> 41:16.875
I don't think he'd leave

41:16.908 --> 41:19.210
something like that
up to chance.

41:19.244 --> 41:20.879
He went back with a plan.

41:20.912 --> 41:22.423
What about all the
people coming through

41:22.447 --> 41:23.649
on the 11th Pilgrimage?

41:23.682 --> 41:25.050
What's going to
happen to Kara?

41:25.083 --> 41:27.218
All we can do
is hope for the best.

41:28.419 --> 41:30.989
And prepare
for the worst.

41:32.323 --> 41:36.227
None of you signed up
for this fight, I know that.

41:37.428 --> 41:39.665
All you wanted
was a second chance

41:39.698 --> 41:41.733
for yourselves and
for your children.

41:41.767 --> 41:45.036
It pains me to have
to ask more of you.

41:45.070 --> 41:49.174
Our home, our hope,
is under attack,

41:49.207 --> 41:53.511
but I've seen your
tenacity, your bravery.

41:53.545 --> 41:55.113
I've seen you
carve out lives

41:55.146 --> 41:57.949
for yourselves in this
harsh environment.

41:57.983 --> 42:00.919
I've seen you face
untold dangers,

42:00.952 --> 42:03.488
and I'll tell you
from my heart,

42:03.521 --> 42:06.992
there are no people

42:07.025 --> 42:09.995
that I would rather
fight alongside.

42:10.028 --> 42:13.498
If we stand strong,
shoulder to shoulder,

42:13.531 --> 42:16.001
we'll prevail.
