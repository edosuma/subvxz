02:46.767 --> 02:48.700
Loser!

03:24.404 --> 03:26.305
- Stats?

03:26.307 --> 03:29.041
- 18 deliveries for $79 in tips.

03:29.043 --> 03:30.209
- Stiffs?

03:30.211 --> 03:31.710
- Three no-tippers.

03:31.712 --> 03:33.712
- Right. Miscellaneous?

03:33.714 --> 03:36.348
- Two phone numbers,
one act of vandalism.

03:36.350 --> 03:39.818
- Okay, $79...

03:50.363 --> 03:52.097
- Your favourite.

03:52.099 --> 03:53.732
- Veggie?

03:53.734 --> 03:55.267
- Don't be stupid, Matty.

03:55.269 --> 03:57.603
You're a growing boy.
All meat.

03:57.605 --> 03:59.671
- It's Matthew.
Thanks, Tim.

03:59.673 --> 04:01.740
- Sure, Matty.

04:04.345 --> 04:06.912
<i>The Steelhawks have been</i>

04:06.914 --> 04:10.716
<i>almost unstoppable on the power
play during these playoffs.</i>

04:10.718 --> 04:14.186
<i>This is a great opportunity
for them to tie this game up.</i>

04:14.188 --> 04:16.355
<i>Seminelli Wields
from behind his neck.</i>

04:16.357 --> 04:19.558
<i>He hits Gartley with a lead pass
coming out of the zone.</i>

04:19.560 --> 04:22.127
<i>You know they wanna get it
to Tucker on open ice.</i>

04:22.129 --> 04:23.762
<i>They do!</i>

04:23.764 --> 04:27.032
<i>Tucker has a full head of steam,
cutting across the blue line,</i>

04:27.034 --> 04:29.301
<i>cuts around Clark,
but here comes Dalmayo!</i>

04:29.303 --> 04:32.271
<i>Holy black and gold!
Tucker is sent flying!</i>

04:32.273 --> 04:33.972
<i>He's writhing on the ice!</i>

04:35.576 --> 04:38.744
<i>He locked knees with Dalmayo,
and this does not look good.</i>

04:38.746 --> 04:41.747
<i>There's not a sound
coming from the stands.</i>

04:41.749 --> 04:45.284
<i>Everyone's holding their breath
for their star player.</i>

04:45.286 --> 04:46.952
<i>This isn't the first time</i>

04:46.954 --> 04:49.655
<i>we've seen Dalmayo
pull a trick like this.</i>

04:49.657 --> 04:53.792
<i>Tim Tucker, the most touted
junior hockey player in years</i>

04:53.794 --> 04:56.295
<i>is now being placed
on a stretcher.</i>

04:56.297 --> 05:00.065
<i>We can only hope this is not
as serious as it looks.</i>

07:04.957 --> 07:07.626
<i>- It's in!
He shoots, he scores!</i>

07:24.777 --> 07:27.779
- Hey, what the hell
is he trying to do?

07:27.781 --> 07:30.515
Why didn't he take
this one instead?

07:38.624 --> 07:41.993
You wanna do this?
You wanna do this?

07:41.995 --> 07:45.130
Oh, it is on.
Oh, it is on!

07:52.739 --> 07:55.273
Oh, ho ho!

07:55.275 --> 07:57.843
You've awoken
the bear tonight, buddy!

07:57.845 --> 08:00.745
I am going to eat your garbage

08:00.747 --> 08:03.448
and shit in your trunk!

08:03.450 --> 08:07.018
Are we gonna do this?
Oh, are we gonna do this?

08:07.020 --> 08:11.256
Your ass is grass!
Your grass is ass!

08:16.363 --> 08:18.663
Hey, it's your
pizza-delivery guy.

08:18.665 --> 08:21.166
Yep! Should be there
in 3 to 4 minutes.

08:37.216 --> 08:40.018
That's exact change, kid.

08:43.722 --> 08:45.123
You know what you are?

08:45.125 --> 08:46.291
You are a front

08:46.293 --> 08:48.560
for your parents'
penny-pinching operation.

08:48.562 --> 08:49.895
Yes, you are!

08:49.897 --> 08:52.297
You're a shield for these
cheap-as-fuck shitheads!

08:52.299 --> 08:55.000
Your parents are house-poor.
You know what that means?

08:55.002 --> 08:56.835
It means they're
tighter than a nun's...

08:58.238 --> 09:01.172
and that is why you should
always respect your parents

09:01.174 --> 09:03.074
and brush your
teeth every night.

09:11.817 --> 09:14.586
- Holden, honey, can you
run this pizza inside, okay?

09:14.588 --> 09:16.321
And just set the table for me.

09:16.323 --> 09:18.390
I'll be right in
in one second, okay?

09:27.033 --> 09:29.501
10 years and all
you bring is a pizza?

09:30.436 --> 09:32.337
- I'm sorry.

09:32.339 --> 09:34.272
I should've told you.

09:34.274 --> 09:37.275
I shouldn't have left like that.

09:37.277 --> 09:39.878
I... I am an...

09:39.880 --> 09:43.882
- An idiot! I know.

09:43.884 --> 09:47.352
Yeah, well, you did always
look good in a uniform.

09:47.354 --> 09:51.623
- Living the dream, putting on
this upper crust pizza Jersey.

09:51.625 --> 09:55.860
- Hmm! Perhaps you've inspired
Holden to live the dream too.

09:55.862 --> 09:58.563
I heard that chat
you had with him.

09:58.565 --> 10:01.600
- Holden, the kid!
- Mm-hmm!

10:01.602 --> 10:03.635
- Yeah, you heard that.
- Yep!

10:05.204 --> 10:08.440
- Wow! Wow, kid!

10:08.442 --> 10:11.409
You look great, considering...

10:11.411 --> 10:13.612
- I babysit with
Winston once a week.

10:13.614 --> 10:15.981
- Winston! Wow,
you got a dog too?

10:15.983 --> 10:19.150
That's... that's great!
I love dogs.

10:19.152 --> 10:21.553
- Winston is my fiancé.

10:21.555 --> 10:24.122
- Fiancé. Engaged.

10:25.057 --> 10:26.925
Oh, wow! Yeah!

10:26.927 --> 10:30.128
Well, it makes sense
someone scooped you up...

10:31.564 --> 10:34.199
Even if they do
have a dog's name.

10:35.134 --> 10:37.002
That's great.

10:39.138 --> 10:42.741
- Well, I'm sure you have some
other deliveries to get to.

10:42.743 --> 10:44.976
- Nope! Nope!
Slow night. Not really.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.645
Um...

10:48.147 --> 10:51.983
You sure about
this Winston dog guy?

10:57.490 --> 10:59.157
Jesus!

10:59.159 --> 11:01.660
There are other words
than "great," Tim.

11:01.662 --> 11:03.762
Stupid, Tim! Stupid!

11:05.965 --> 11:07.599
- Almost forgot your tip.

11:07.601 --> 11:09.401
- That's great.

11:14.206 --> 11:16.474
28 for $110,
one ex-girlfriend.

11:16.476 --> 11:18.243
Bic it and box it!

11:19.445 --> 11:20.945
- What ex-girlfriend?

11:20.947 --> 11:22.380
-<i> The</i> ex-girlfriend.

12:47.033 --> 12:48.933
Get in the corners!

12:48.935 --> 12:50.769
- You going to the reunion?

12:50.771 --> 12:52.871
- What? Offside!

12:52.873 --> 12:54.405
Offside!

12:54.407 --> 12:56.474
- Sterling cup
reunion weekend, man.

12:56.476 --> 12:58.777
It's been 10 years
since you guys won it.

12:58.779 --> 13:00.245
It's gonna be fucking huge!

13:00.247 --> 13:01.980
- I didn't win, if you remember.

13:01.982 --> 13:03.381
I lost.

13:03.383 --> 13:06.317
- The only reason they got
there was because of you.

13:06.319 --> 13:08.553
They won it for you.
You have to go.

13:08.555 --> 13:10.121
- Ah, I don't know.

13:10.123 --> 13:13.224
The only reason I'm back in
the city is because of Matty.

13:13.226 --> 13:14.959
I really feel like
I let him down

13:14.961 --> 13:18.229
by not being there for him when
he was growing up, you know?

13:18.231 --> 13:19.764
- Yeah, kid is a bit weird.

13:19.766 --> 13:21.132
- You're a bit weird.

13:21.134 --> 13:23.902
- Look, you obviously had
your shit to take care of.

13:23.904 --> 13:25.670
Just...
Just let it go.

13:25.672 --> 13:28.006
- I let it go for
10 years, Bobby.

13:28.008 --> 13:29.707
I can't do it anymore.

13:30.843 --> 13:32.911
- Yeah.

13:34.814 --> 13:37.315
Like, uh...

13:38.918 --> 13:40.652
Where did you let it go?

13:40.654 --> 13:42.921
- Hit him for Christ's sake!

13:46.659 --> 13:50.161
- Yeah, you're right.
Hell of a game!

13:50.163 --> 13:52.130
Hell of a game, boys!

13:52.132 --> 13:54.833
Come on! Come on,
get in there!

13:56.535 --> 13:58.503
- Ran into Kelly.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.004
- No!

14:00.006 --> 14:01.306
- Yep!

14:02.509 --> 14:04.809
10 years and she's
just jumped right in,

14:04.811 --> 14:07.178
fiancé, house, babysitting.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.647
It's like she jumped
right out of my bed

14:09.649 --> 14:11.616
right into the next guy's.

14:11.618 --> 14:13.651
- Never was sure about her.

14:13.653 --> 14:14.652
- Forecheck!

14:14.654 --> 14:15.687
- Use your head!

14:15.689 --> 14:16.888
- Show us some more!

14:16.890 --> 14:18.990
- Come on!
Get in there, Richardson!

14:19.993 --> 14:21.860
- Ugh, she was acting all, like:

14:21.862 --> 14:23.228
"Look at me and my maturity!

14:23.230 --> 14:25.496
"Like, thinking about
having a kid is hard."

14:25.498 --> 14:28.533
I can have a kid brewing tonight
if I wanted to, you know?

14:28.535 --> 14:29.667
- Fuck yeah!

14:29.669 --> 14:31.703
- Done, in these big
old balls of mine!

14:31.705 --> 14:35.039
- It takes real talent to live
like you do and <i> not</i> have a kid.

14:35.041 --> 14:37.242
You are the mature one.
No question there.

14:37.244 --> 14:39.911
- It's like she's trying
to prove something to me

14:39.913 --> 14:41.479
or something.

14:41.481 --> 14:43.047
- You got nothing to prove.

14:43.049 --> 14:44.082
- Exactly.

14:44.084 --> 14:46.084
What is this
special-ed hockey?

14:46.086 --> 14:48.887
- Come on! Get in
the corner, Richardson!

14:48.889 --> 14:51.856
Get in there, Richardson!
You are a mistake!

14:51.858 --> 14:53.157
- Aaah!

14:53.159 --> 14:55.793
- A drunken fucking
mistake, Richardson!

14:57.663 --> 14:59.864
What about this fiancé of hers?

14:59.866 --> 15:02.100
- I didn't see him.
I don't know.

15:02.102 --> 15:05.370
- Well, there you!
He's probably some fat slob!

15:05.372 --> 15:06.704
You're in great shape.

15:06.706 --> 15:08.573
You've got a Sterling cup ring.

15:08.575 --> 15:11.442
Plus you deliver pizza
faster than anybody else

15:11.444 --> 15:13.111
in the history of pie ever!

15:13.113 --> 15:14.445
What does he have?

15:14.447 --> 15:16.848
- I have to see him.

15:16.850 --> 15:18.383
Yeah.

15:18.385 --> 15:20.451
Who is this replacement me?

15:21.754 --> 15:24.422
- Stakeout!

15:24.424 --> 15:27.025
- Can I trust you to
be stealth enough?

15:27.027 --> 15:28.860
- Oh, I can be stealthy.

15:28.862 --> 15:30.295
- How stealthy?

15:30.297 --> 15:32.030
- The stealthiest!

15:38.904 --> 15:40.805
Damn!

15:40.807 --> 15:43.308
Kelly looks good!

15:43.310 --> 15:45.376
- I know.

15:45.378 --> 15:48.212
Where is this fat-slob
fiancé of yours?

15:48.214 --> 15:50.081
- Man, she's slow at this!

15:50.083 --> 15:52.717
You were always so
quick to get it off.

15:52.719 --> 15:55.320
Remember that
one-handed trick you had?

15:55.322 --> 15:57.822
You were so fucking slick!

15:57.824 --> 16:01.926
And you would just be hard as
a rock while you were doing it.

16:01.928 --> 16:04.595
- Did you spy on me and Kelly?

16:04.597 --> 16:07.131
- What? N-no!

16:07.133 --> 16:08.833
Are you...
are you crazy?

16:08.835 --> 16:11.502
I... I just meant
that it reminds me

16:11.504 --> 16:15.239
of you and me getting
into trouble and stuff!

16:15.241 --> 16:18.576
Timmy and Bobby bird-dogging
chicks, you know?

16:18.578 --> 16:20.945
Taking it out and
chopping it up!

16:20.947 --> 16:24.515
God! So many
fucking questions!

16:25.451 --> 16:27.618
Just watch!

16:27.620 --> 16:29.420
Come on!

16:33.859 --> 16:35.293
- What the fuck, Bobby?

16:35.295 --> 16:38.062
- Hey, what... aaah!

16:39.365 --> 16:41.332
- What the fuck?
Just scatter!

16:44.536 --> 16:47.105
- Tim! Tim!

16:55.014 --> 16:57.548
Thought you had a bad knee.

17:06.392 --> 17:09.660
- Okay, stop what you're doing
and put your hands up.

17:11.131 --> 17:13.131
- You didn't tell me
to drop my weapon.

17:13.133 --> 17:14.632
- You fucker!

17:15.635 --> 17:17.468
That's where you
were pissing, man!

17:17.470 --> 17:18.736
- Warm, ain't it?

17:24.309 --> 17:26.176
You're fighting
a cop, you idiot!

17:26.179 --> 17:28.746
- You're fighting a guy
with his pants down!

17:30.083 --> 17:31.916
- Ha!

17:33.653 --> 17:35.086
Tim Tucker?

17:35.088 --> 17:37.155
- Yes! No! Fuck!

17:37.157 --> 17:38.723
- It's me, bill!

17:40.493 --> 17:43.494
- You... you usually make
introductions like this?

17:43.496 --> 17:44.862
- Steel mill bill, man!

17:44.864 --> 17:47.198
The hawks! You in town
for the reunion?

17:47.200 --> 17:48.466
- Aw, Jesus!

17:51.104 --> 17:52.603
- How's it going, buddy?

17:52.605 --> 17:53.738
You pissed on my leg!

17:53.740 --> 17:54.872
- What did you expect?

17:54.874 --> 17:56.908
I thought you were
just some dumb cop.

17:56.910 --> 17:59.610
- I am a dumb cop! Look how
fast you stole my gun!

17:59.612 --> 18:00.611
- I just got lucky.

18:00.613 --> 18:02.113
- Drink?
- Yes!

18:03.783 --> 18:05.850
- Ah!

18:05.852 --> 18:09.020
You gotta have some
stories, though, huh?

18:09.022 --> 18:13.491
Wait. I don't even wanna know.
It'll just make me jealous.

18:15.561 --> 18:17.862
- I'm a pizza-delivery driver.

18:20.599 --> 18:22.767
- No!
- Yep!

18:23.702 --> 18:25.536
- Aw, man!

18:25.538 --> 18:29.540
I don't know if that
makes me sad or happy.

18:29.542 --> 18:31.642
- Yeah, me neither.

18:31.644 --> 18:34.445
- I can't wait to tell my wife

18:34.447 --> 18:38.783
that I have a better job
than Tim fucking Tucker!

18:40.487 --> 18:42.587
She always had a crush on you!

18:42.589 --> 18:43.955
- You know what?
Go ahead.

18:43.957 --> 18:46.090
Use me to get some
action with your wife,

18:46.092 --> 18:48.659
as long as she's thinking
about me the whole time.

18:48.661 --> 18:50.128
- Oh, fuck you!

18:51.331 --> 18:53.664
I'm just leveraging your
shortcomings, buddy!

18:53.666 --> 18:55.500
- I got plenty of those, man!

18:55.502 --> 18:59.070
- Please tell me you're
delivering in the bangin' wagon.

19:00.439 --> 19:03.774
- Delivering porn dreams
one knock at a time.

19:03.776 --> 19:05.276
- Get the fuck out of here!

19:05.278 --> 19:06.744
Are you serious?
- Yeah!

19:06.746 --> 19:09.847
- Do people know they're
getting their pizza delivered

19:09.849 --> 19:11.516
in a pubescent experiment?

19:11.518 --> 19:14.152
How many of us lost our
virginity in that thing?

19:14.154 --> 19:15.319
Like, six?

19:15.321 --> 19:16.821
- Seven!

19:16.823 --> 19:20.091
And you guys darted up the
whole interior, especially you.

19:20.093 --> 19:23.928
You were shooting ropes from
the fucking back to the front!

19:23.930 --> 19:26.297
I had to tell my
parents it was marks

19:26.299 --> 19:28.032
for a streak with the team.

19:31.036 --> 19:32.503
- You were always good

19:32.505 --> 19:34.972
at thinking on your
toes, though, man!

19:34.974 --> 19:37.108
Ah, fuck!

19:37.110 --> 19:40.645
You know your parents totally
fucked in that car, too, right?

19:40.647 --> 19:41.846
Ha!

19:41.848 --> 19:44.415
- My parents are dead, bill.

19:45.851 --> 19:47.218
- Yeah.

19:47.220 --> 19:48.853
I'm just, like, pointing out

19:48.855 --> 19:51.289
what a wonderful life
they had, you know,

19:51.291 --> 19:55.026
including banging in the cozy
confines of their prodigal son.

19:55.028 --> 19:56.394
Family tree, bud!

19:56.396 --> 19:59.397
- You got that whole
police-harassment thing nailed,

19:59.399 --> 20:00.665
my friend.

20:00.667 --> 20:03.167
- First thing they teach
you at the academy.

20:03.169 --> 20:04.902
- At least you can still learn

20:04.904 --> 20:07.905
after taking all those
shots to the head, my friend.

20:07.907 --> 20:11.409
- You know, every one of
those shots to the head

20:11.411 --> 20:12.910
were for you, pal.

20:12.912 --> 20:14.512
Don't you ever forget it!

20:14.514 --> 20:16.147
- Never, brother.

20:17.883 --> 20:21.419
- Oh, fuck you! Don't even
fucking think about it!

20:21.421 --> 20:24.488
You're gonna try to
kiss me after 3 beers?

20:24.490 --> 20:26.691
That's what we used to call you,

20:26.693 --> 20:28.092
the three-beer queer!

20:29.329 --> 20:31.662
- Fuck you! I'll save it
for your wife, then.

20:31.664 --> 20:32.997
- Oh, fuck you!

21:15.540 --> 21:18.042
- The motel district
is not our area.

21:18.044 --> 21:20.244
- Yeah, but the food is made.

21:20.246 --> 21:21.946
- It's not our area.

21:21.948 --> 21:24.649
Those motels are full
of hookers and scumbags.

21:24.651 --> 21:26.250
No way!

21:26.252 --> 21:28.252
- But the food is already made!

21:28.254 --> 21:30.454
There's no point in wasting it.

21:30.456 --> 21:31.822
- But you will waste my time

21:31.824 --> 21:33.791
and all my other deliveries
will be late.

21:33.793 --> 21:36.394
- Hey, this is about
customer service!

21:36.396 --> 21:38.562
- These are not our customers.

21:38.564 --> 21:42.566
- But the food is already made.
That's my point.

21:42.568 --> 21:45.403
- It's 3 beef and extra cheese.

21:45.405 --> 21:47.672
- Yeah, those are the toppings.

21:47.674 --> 21:49.307
- You know who orders that?

21:49.309 --> 21:51.509
Junkies and Douchebags.
Neither tip.

21:51.511 --> 21:54.745
You're gonna have to give me
extra mileage for this.

21:56.282 --> 21:58.516
- All right, I'll give you
an extra buck.

22:01.521 --> 22:04.155
And don't forget
the $5-off coupon!

22:04.157 --> 22:06.691
- Do we even have
a $5-off coupon?

22:06.693 --> 22:08.392
- I don't think so!

22:11.296 --> 22:14.565
- Pizza!
It's the pizza guy!

22:24.643 --> 22:27.144
- Holy fuck, man!
It's a white pizza guy.

22:27.146 --> 22:28.946
- No shit!
- I'm fucking serious!

22:28.948 --> 22:30.548
- Get his autograph!

22:30.550 --> 22:32.450
- Why the fuck would I do that?

22:32.452 --> 22:34.819
- I don't know,
'cause you're a fucking idiot!

22:34.821 --> 22:36.554
- Man, scrounge up some cash!

22:36.556 --> 22:38.055
- I got the ice!

22:38.057 --> 22:40.825
- My hands are full.
I can't even reach my pockets.

22:40.827 --> 22:42.727
- Give him the money already!

22:47.999 --> 22:49.967
- Here's your fucking money!

22:49.969 --> 22:52.036
And I need the coupon.

22:52.038 --> 22:53.371
- What's he talking about?

22:53.373 --> 22:54.739
- Yeah, man, some coupon!

22:54.741 --> 22:56.974
I guess the cleaning lady
must've taken it.

22:56.976 --> 22:59.910
- Yeah, I think she thought
it was her tip or something.

22:59.912 --> 23:02.680
- Listen, she's not too hard
to track down, brother.

23:02.682 --> 23:05.750
She's the one up the lane-way
with the cart and the towels.

23:09.020 --> 23:10.588
- You got a fucking problem?

23:10.590 --> 23:13.023
- Ah! Yeah, he's white.
Big fucking deal!

23:13.025 --> 23:15.693
He's still a
piece-of-shit delivery guy.

23:15.695 --> 23:18.062
Let's close the door
so we can eat.

23:22.234 --> 23:24.268
We have a problem here?

23:24.270 --> 23:27.438
- No, you guys are the ones
with the problem.

23:41.220 --> 23:42.987
- You fuck!

24:01.773 --> 24:04.341
- Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

24:19.292 --> 24:20.825
- Man, did you see that car?

24:20.827 --> 24:22.693
- Yeah, I saw that car.

25:17.649 --> 25:20.317
- The customers at the motel
got a problem.

25:20.319 --> 25:22.987
Wrong toppings on
one of the pizzas.

25:22.989 --> 25:25.356
You gotta go back
with a new one.

25:25.358 --> 25:27.291
- Okay.

25:27.293 --> 25:29.527
- This is good customer service!

25:30.695 --> 25:33.831
- I know. I know.

25:33.833 --> 25:35.733
- Extra buck!

25:49.748 --> 25:52.516
- Hope you're comfortable
back there, Sonny.

25:52.518 --> 25:56.020
Please let the front desk know
if they can get you anything.

25:56.022 --> 25:59.156
- Could you have the concierge
send up a couple of goons

25:59.158 --> 26:00.591
to do a small job for me,

26:00.593 --> 26:03.527
and make sure they're not
beaten and broken, please.

26:03.529 --> 26:04.929
- They were dicks!

26:04.931 --> 26:07.998
- Shut the fuck up
and imagine what I was thinking

26:08.000 --> 26:11.869
when I heard my so-called thugs
got the shit kicked out of them

26:11.871 --> 26:13.537
by a pizza-delivery driver!

26:13.539 --> 26:16.740
- Well, at least I know
they won't go to the cops now.

26:16.742 --> 26:18.008
- Yeah, but I might.

26:19.878 --> 26:21.612
That's right!

26:21.614 --> 26:23.514
They may be very
interested to know

26:23.516 --> 26:26.550
that Timmy two guns is living
in the general vicinity.

26:26.552 --> 26:28.919
- I know you better
than that, Sonny.

26:28.921 --> 26:32.189
- Yeah. Right.

26:34.859 --> 26:38.796
That is a very fetching costume
you have on.

26:38.798 --> 26:43.767
Tell me, do you always pulverize
customers who don't tip?

26:43.769 --> 26:46.937
- First time.
But it felt good.

26:46.939 --> 26:49.840
- It felt good because
that's who you are.

26:51.076 --> 26:55.546
You are a pit bull,
not a pizza boy.

26:55.548 --> 26:58.582
Come back and work for me.

26:58.584 --> 27:02.820
You have to accept
responsibility for who you are.

27:02.822 --> 27:06.624
- That's exactly what
I am trying to do.

27:06.626 --> 27:08.158
- Hmm!

27:08.160 --> 27:11.862
Thanks, two guns.
I'll be in touch.

27:20.105 --> 27:23.140
<i>- But after this, you're done.
You're through.</i>

27:23.142 --> 27:25.676
You leave this town.
You get the fuck out of here!

27:25.678 --> 27:27.111
- But we live here!

27:27.113 --> 27:28.646
- Not anymore!

27:28.648 --> 27:31.949
- But we can... we... we can do
this job that you hired us for!

27:31.951 --> 27:34.752
- You can't even say that
fucking sentence, douchebag!

27:34.754 --> 27:37.488
Let me get this straight.

27:37.490 --> 27:39.690
The three of you, all with guns,

27:39.692 --> 27:43.460
were taken down by
a pizza-delivery driver?

27:43.462 --> 27:47.331
What happens when you meet
an angry waitress

27:47.333 --> 27:51.301
or a moody mailman or
a pissed-off paper boy?

27:51.303 --> 27:52.836
Huh? Tell me that!

27:52.838 --> 27:55.305
- You said it was Timmy two guns
from your old crew!

27:55.307 --> 27:57.341
Like, he's no ordinary
pizza driver!

27:57.343 --> 27:59.009
You fuck!

28:00.613 --> 28:02.112
Let's go.

28:04.115 --> 28:05.983
Hey, fellas, by the way,

28:05.985 --> 28:08.218
be wary of the cleaning lady

28:08.220 --> 28:11.221
'cause she looks
mighty surly tonight.

28:14.959 --> 28:18.028
- I told you the cleaning
lady looked mean!

28:18.030 --> 28:20.464
- He was being
sarcastic, asshole,

28:20.466 --> 28:24.234
saying we can't defend ourselves
against Subservians and shit!

28:24.236 --> 28:26.637
- "Subservians" is not a word.

28:26.639 --> 28:29.039
- Did you know what
I meant by it?

28:29.041 --> 28:30.340
- No!

28:30.342 --> 28:32.643
- Then how do you know
it's not a fucking word?

28:32.645 --> 28:35.245
- Just fucking count!
Tell me how much money we have.

28:35.247 --> 28:37.081
- You know, not as much
as we would get

28:37.083 --> 28:39.049
if we did the job
we were supposed to do.

28:39.051 --> 28:40.317
That's for sure!

28:41.320 --> 28:43.420
- Man, fuck this Timmy prick!

28:43.422 --> 28:45.422
What's so special about him?

28:45.424 --> 28:47.024
Next time I see him,

28:47.026 --> 28:49.927
I'm gonna "Subserviate"
the shit out of him.

28:49.929 --> 28:51.729
Hmm?

28:51.731 --> 28:54.865
- You know what?
Fuck this!

28:57.269 --> 28:59.703
Let's go get loaded.

28:59.705 --> 29:01.271
- What about don, man?

29:01.273 --> 29:04.575
Shouldn't we take him
somewhere or something,

29:04.577 --> 29:06.176
uh, help him and shit?

29:06.178 --> 29:08.445
- More money for us.

29:10.516 --> 29:12.883
- What's he talking
about, "retards"?

29:12.885 --> 29:15.052
That's a good fucking idea, man!

29:15.054 --> 29:16.186
- Thank you.

29:17.556 --> 29:20.524
You know what? I kind of
like it without don.

29:21.459 --> 29:23.460
- Yeah!

29:30.468 --> 29:32.236
It's nice.

29:32.238 --> 29:33.904
It's like...

29:33.906 --> 29:36.206
It's like he's here
but he's not.

29:36.208 --> 29:37.741
- Yeah!

29:37.743 --> 29:42.146
- You think the cabbie will
help us load him into the car?

29:42.148 --> 29:45.415
- Yeah! I mean, he's
like luggage now.

29:45.417 --> 29:48.786
- I just point
and I say: "Luggage."

29:48.788 --> 29:49.787
- Yeah!

29:51.557 --> 29:53.857
- Nice. Nice.
I like it.

29:56.095 --> 29:58.495
Is that who I think it is?

29:58.497 --> 30:00.164
- No way!
- Yeah!

30:00.166 --> 30:03.634
- I mean, I thought he was in,
like, the military or something.

30:03.636 --> 30:05.969
- I thought he was
a hockey god in Finland.

30:05.971 --> 30:09.106
- Okay, guys, maybe he's both
of those. I don't know.

30:09.108 --> 30:12.442
But fuck me if he didn't
deliver me a pizza last week!

30:13.445 --> 30:15.012
- No shit!
- Mm-hmm!

30:15.014 --> 30:16.647
- No, he was probably doing that

30:16.649 --> 30:18.282
because he wanted
to talk to you.

30:18.284 --> 30:19.483
- Oh no! Oh no!

30:19.485 --> 30:21.952
He was totally harassing
Winston's nephew

30:21.954 --> 30:23.253
about giving him tips.

30:23.255 --> 30:25.622
- Tim Tucker working for tips?
- Mm-hmm!

30:25.624 --> 30:26.623
- Goddamn!

30:26.625 --> 30:28.025
- Hmm...
- Huh!

30:28.027 --> 30:30.627
- Maybe that would make sense
if he were a stripper.

30:30.629 --> 30:31.962
- Hmm! Hmm!

30:31.964 --> 30:34.231
- I live in my mom's basement.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.935
I would've went with you.

30:39.537 --> 30:42.139
- I couldn't take you
where I went.

30:42.141 --> 30:45.275
- Fuck you!
Don't fucking give me...

30:45.277 --> 30:47.978
- I went to Montreal,
I got drunk, I fought a lot,

30:47.980 --> 30:50.814
got recruited for a couple
less-than-reputable jobs,

30:50.816 --> 30:52.482
found out I was good at it,

30:52.484 --> 30:54.651
did more of them,
climbed the ranks

30:54.653 --> 30:56.620
and became a
top-level earner.

30:58.790 --> 31:00.824
- Are you talking about Amway?

31:00.826 --> 31:03.994
- More along the lines of
killing and stealing.

31:07.198 --> 31:09.366
- Yeah.

31:09.368 --> 31:11.068
Yeah, that makes sense.

31:11.070 --> 31:13.003
Okay, sure.

31:13.005 --> 31:15.239
Barkeep!

31:15.241 --> 31:19.209
A couple of bourbons for me
and the Doodfella over here!

31:22.414 --> 31:25.883
- I don't know!
He's looking good!

31:40.432 --> 31:44.101
- What did you
call his dick again, Kel?

31:44.103 --> 31:47.404
It was like...
- Little big tuck?

31:48.908 --> 31:50.841
- Yeah!
- Oh shit!

31:50.843 --> 31:54.244
- Why do I get the feeling you
ladies were talking about me?

31:54.246 --> 31:57.047
- I was just sharing
your shakedown techniques

31:57.049 --> 31:58.081
on little boys.

31:58.083 --> 32:00.517
- Untrue, ladies. Untrue.

32:00.519 --> 32:03.287
I never miss an opportunity
to educate our young.

32:03.289 --> 32:05.889
They are our future,
and I truly believe that.

32:05.891 --> 32:09.359
- So, you're,
like, a pizza Buddhist?

32:10.696 --> 32:13.030
- The pizza driver is
the waiter of the streets,

32:13.032 --> 32:14.798
delivering hot food to your home

32:14.800 --> 32:17.067
without the perks of
a controlled climate

32:17.069 --> 32:18.435
or nice trays,

32:18.437 --> 32:20.938
but, rather, increasing gas
prices, bad traffic

32:20.940 --> 32:23.407
and whatever mother nature
chooses to dish out.

32:23.409 --> 32:25.075
We are road warriors,

32:25.077 --> 32:27.911
and we should be paid
and treated as such.

32:27.913 --> 32:30.213
- You'd make more money
stripping, mad Max.

32:30.215 --> 32:31.949
- I prefer driving.

32:31.951 --> 32:34.918
- I think we spent half
of senior year in that wagon.

32:34.920 --> 32:37.321
- I'm just gonna go
powder my nose.

32:37.323 --> 32:38.822
- Ah, me too.

32:38.824 --> 32:40.924
- The guy at the bar over there

32:40.926 --> 32:43.226
would love to
powder his nose too.

32:43.228 --> 32:45.462
- Okay. We'll find him.
- On it.

32:45.464 --> 32:46.897
- Mm-hmm!

32:49.001 --> 32:51.768
- Ah! You girls like music?
You like music?

32:51.770 --> 32:53.303
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Me too!

32:53.305 --> 32:55.939
What about this sweater?
You like this sweater?

32:55.941 --> 32:58.442
I got it 4, maybe
6 years ago for Christmas.

32:58.444 --> 32:59.443
No, no! Two. Two.

32:59.445 --> 33:00.944
Definitely two.
Definitely two.

33:00.946 --> 33:02.412
Usually my mom has shit taste,

33:02.414 --> 33:05.115
but she fucking knocked it out
of the park on this one!

33:05.117 --> 33:07.017
You girls wanna make out
or something,

33:07.019 --> 33:08.852
celebrate our new family here?

33:08.854 --> 33:10.420
- Uh, yeah, I don't think so.

33:10.422 --> 33:13.657
That knitwear you're wearing,
it's a real turnoff.

33:13.659 --> 33:15.859
- Boom! How about now?

33:15.861 --> 33:18.261
- Yeah, I don't think so.

33:18.263 --> 33:20.630
Um, your upper body
is a real turnoff.

33:20.632 --> 33:23.934
- Okay, um, you don't like
the upper body. How about...

33:23.936 --> 33:25.202
- Jesus!

33:25.204 --> 33:26.937
- How about the lower body?

33:26.939 --> 33:28.538
- Bobby! Stop it!

33:28.540 --> 33:30.540
- Okay!

33:30.542 --> 33:32.275
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

33:32.277 --> 33:33.844
Fine, fine, fine!
Okay! Okay!

33:33.846 --> 33:36.179
Uh, what next?
Let's write a rap song!

33:36.181 --> 33:38.048
Let's write a rap song!

33:38.050 --> 33:41.485
Do you rap a rap song or
write a rap song or do you...

33:41.487 --> 33:44.521
Are rap songs just, like,
rapped and then transcribed?

33:44.523 --> 33:46.289
Okay, yeah, you're probably right.

33:47.693 --> 33:50.060
It's about the attitude,
not the words, you know?

33:51.163 --> 33:52.529
Oh god!

33:54.033 --> 33:56.500
Whoo! Oh man!

33:56.502 --> 33:57.734
Fucking great!

33:59.238 --> 34:00.904
Ooh! Yeah!

34:00.906 --> 34:04.174
Hey! Hey! What...
what's going on?

34:04.176 --> 34:05.242
Back for more!

34:05.244 --> 34:06.243
- Yeah.

34:06.245 --> 34:08.011
- Okay, okay.
I'll see you later.

34:08.013 --> 34:11.181
- So, you know about
the reunion, right?

34:11.183 --> 34:13.150
- I can't seem to escape it.

34:13.152 --> 34:15.152
- Me too. Dad just
got back in town.

34:15.154 --> 34:16.485
That's why I'm here.

34:16.487 --> 34:19.056
He's already tried to
rearrange my living room,

34:19.058 --> 34:21.858
and he's been at my house
for, like, 3 hours.

34:21.860 --> 34:23.659
Totally him, right?

34:23.661 --> 34:25.728
- Coach knows game
plans, blueprints.

34:25.731 --> 34:27.030
I'm sure he's right.

34:27.032 --> 34:29.599
- You should come by
and see him tomorrow.

34:29.601 --> 34:31.234
Totally shit himself!

34:31.235 --> 34:33.036
- Me, you, Winston and coach.

34:33.038 --> 34:34.271
One big happy family.

34:34.273 --> 34:36.373
- You haven't even met Winston.

34:36.375 --> 34:37.908
I'm sure you'd like him.

34:37.909 --> 34:41.110
- He's with you. That makes it
fundamentally impossible.

34:41.112 --> 34:44.347
He could be Santa Claus,
and I'd still have to hate him.

34:44.349 --> 34:45.949
- It's been 10 years, Tucker.

34:45.951 --> 34:47.451
Get over me.

34:49.520 --> 34:51.420
- When did you get engaged?

34:51.422 --> 34:53.190
- Last month.

34:53.192 --> 34:54.858
- Last month?

34:54.860 --> 34:57.160
Where did he ask you?

34:58.429 --> 35:00.464
- I asked him.

35:00.466 --> 35:01.598
- No shit!

35:01.600 --> 35:03.200
- Yeah!

35:03.202 --> 35:07.037
Dad called, said he was gonna
be back in town for the reunion,

35:07.039 --> 35:10.574
and kind of made me put my life
into perspective, you know?

35:10.576 --> 35:13.643
Made me think that it was time
for me to grow up.

35:13.645 --> 35:15.745
So I asked Winston for his hand.

35:15.747 --> 35:17.647
- Then I showed up with pizza.

35:17.649 --> 35:19.749
- Then you showed up with pizza.

35:19.751 --> 35:22.886
- If only I'd delivered
you pizza sooner.

35:22.888 --> 35:25.122
- Wouldn't have
made a difference.

35:25.124 --> 35:26.957
We were kids, Tim.

35:26.959 --> 35:29.092
This is an adult relationship,

35:29.094 --> 35:31.728
a relationship with
one bank account.

35:31.730 --> 35:33.463
And you deliver pizza.

35:33.465 --> 35:35.465
- If I had a bank account,

35:35.467 --> 35:38.068
I would totally
share it with you.

35:38.070 --> 35:41.204
- But I don't wanna
share a shoebox.

35:43.774 --> 35:48.078
Why don't you come over
for brunch tomorrow,

35:48.080 --> 35:52.215
and you can meet him
and you can see dad.

35:54.652 --> 35:57.854
- Are you inviting me for
a sleepover tonight?

35:59.257 --> 36:01.358
- No.

36:01.360 --> 36:03.760
I'm inviting you to brunch.

36:05.329 --> 36:08.532
We need some cocksucking,

36:08.534 --> 36:10.267
fucking service here!

36:12.637 --> 36:14.104
Game over!

36:15.541 --> 36:17.207
- Brunch!

36:17.209 --> 36:19.643
Can we get some service?

36:19.645 --> 36:23.180
Hey! Hey!

36:25.183 --> 36:27.717
Bring us some beer!

36:35.526 --> 36:37.561
- She says she's engaged,

36:37.563 --> 36:40.197
but, you know, what does
that really mean?

36:40.199 --> 36:43.333
It's been a long time,
and a lot of things change,

36:43.335 --> 36:45.535
but what really
changes, you know?

36:46.637 --> 36:49.206
But her lips...
Oh, ho ho!

36:49.208 --> 36:52.375
Her lips were engaged with me
tonight, Matty, and not his.

36:52.377 --> 36:53.843
- What... what...

36:53.845 --> 36:57.881
- not his. History means more
than a house and a ring.

36:57.883 --> 36:59.749
- Now what, Matty?
What's my move?

36:59.751 --> 37:00.984
- Shit!

37:00.986 --> 37:03.320
- There you go!
Get comfortable with that.

37:03.322 --> 37:05.922
Ah, I've worked with
a lot of shitty people.

37:05.924 --> 37:07.691
I've done a lot of
shitty things.

37:07.693 --> 37:09.192
But I know what love is,

37:09.194 --> 37:11.695
and love happens
at things like brunch.

37:11.697 --> 37:13.330
12 for 46,
3 beat-up men,

37:13.332 --> 37:16.499
one job offer from an ex-boss
and one near kiss with an ex.

37:16.501 --> 37:18.835
- Tim, there's a gun in my hand!

37:18.837 --> 37:21.605
- Yeah, that's right!
Second one.

37:21.607 --> 37:22.872
Because in this life,

37:22.874 --> 37:25.675
you really gotta learn
to watch your own back.

37:28.512 --> 37:30.680
- There's 2 guns in my hand,

37:30.682 --> 37:33.550
and you're telling me
your delivery stats.

37:33.552 --> 37:35.685
- Accounting is
always important.

37:37.723 --> 37:39.356
- Are you a killer, Tim?

37:39.358 --> 37:41.758
- I've killed people
that had it coming.

37:41.760 --> 37:43.393
You know, Matty?
That's it.

37:43.395 --> 37:44.594
- That's a killer!

37:44.596 --> 37:46.630
And you know what killers do?
They justify!

37:46.632 --> 37:48.198
- Well, I'm sure you've wanted

37:48.200 --> 37:51.101
to kill some of your friends
from time to time.

37:51.103 --> 37:53.236
- No, Tim!
I don't have any friends!

37:53.238 --> 37:54.938
And it's probably lucky, too,

37:54.940 --> 37:58.108
because, obviously, the tuckers
have a killer gene in them,

37:58.110 --> 38:01.645
so I'm probably better off
just staying by myself!

38:01.647 --> 38:03.613
- Well, that's the whole point.

38:03.615 --> 38:06.082
We share the same gene.
We're brothers.

38:06.084 --> 38:08.151
And I'm not gonna let
anyone hurt us, okay?

38:08.153 --> 38:09.552
Okay.

38:09.554 --> 38:11.988
- Now let me show you how
to use those. Come on.

38:11.990 --> 38:12.989
One. One.
- Oh god!

38:12.991 --> 38:14.591
- Yeah, like that, big guy!

38:14.593 --> 38:15.892
All right.

38:15.894 --> 38:16.993
- Oh god!

38:18.263 --> 38:21.131
My brother's teaching me
how to be an assassin.

38:21.133 --> 38:22.999
First accounting,
now assassinating.

38:23.001 --> 38:25.468
- Better than algebra, Matty.
Better than algebra.

38:25.470 --> 38:26.770
Now pull the triggers.

38:29.641 --> 38:34.577
And don't you ever do that again
unless you are absolutely sure.

38:36.080 --> 38:38.481
- Okay.

38:38.483 --> 38:40.250
- Good night, Matty!

38:40.252 --> 38:41.751
- Matthew.

38:41.753 --> 38:44.054
Matty's... Matty's fine!
Don't kill me!

39:35.306 --> 39:36.806
- Timothy!

39:36.808 --> 39:39.342
I've heard a lot about
you from Kelly's dad.

39:39.344 --> 39:40.977
Hi! Welcome!

39:48.152 --> 39:49.986
Tucker!

39:49.988 --> 39:53.490
You lollygagging son of a bitch!

39:53.492 --> 39:54.891
You get your ass in here!

39:54.893 --> 39:56.926
- Damn, coach!
You look good! Real good.

39:56.928 --> 39:59.262
That must be your
matching car outside, huh?

40:00.265 --> 40:02.065
- Star players don't kiss ass.

40:02.067 --> 40:03.767
They get their asses kissed!

40:03.769 --> 40:05.001
Get over here!

40:05.936 --> 40:07.604
Oh!

40:07.606 --> 40:08.938
- Okay.

40:08.940 --> 40:11.541
- Flowers! Get the men
a couple of beers, will ya?

40:11.543 --> 40:12.542
- Yeah.

40:12.544 --> 40:13.910
- Honey, you shouldn't have!

40:13.912 --> 40:15.879
- Those are from me.
Don't take credit.

40:15.881 --> 40:17.580
- Considering they
smell like pizza

40:17.582 --> 40:19.949
and were obviously purchased
at a grocery store,

40:19.951 --> 40:21.117
you don't have to worry.

40:21.119 --> 40:22.419
- Pizza-smelling flowers.

40:22.421 --> 40:24.721
That's the most ingenious
thing I've ever heard.

40:24.723 --> 40:26.256
Good work, son.
- Thanks, coach!

40:26.258 --> 40:28.792
Flowers that smell like
flowers have been done death.

40:28.794 --> 40:31.461
- You got that right!
Hey, let's go look at the car.

40:31.463 --> 40:33.563
I remember you used to
like to take Kelly

40:33.565 --> 40:34.764
on all sorts of rides...

40:34.766 --> 40:36.633
- Mm-hmm!
- When you were younger.

40:36.635 --> 40:38.268
What are you driving these days?

40:38.270 --> 40:39.636
- Oh, same thing, actually.

40:39.638 --> 40:42.272
- Bring the beers out to
the car, will ya, flowers?

40:42.274 --> 40:43.973
- Honey, it's just locker talk.

40:43.975 --> 40:45.775
Seriously, don't worry about it.

40:45.777 --> 40:47.944
Put these in some
water for me, okay?

40:47.946 --> 40:48.945
- Yeah!

40:48.947 --> 40:50.947
- All right, thanks.

40:50.949 --> 40:52.882
It's a real Frankenstein.

40:52.884 --> 40:55.318
Yeah, I know the feeling.

40:55.320 --> 40:58.087
- You know, I thought
you'd be, uh, tearing up

40:58.089 --> 41:01.458
some backwoods semi-pro league
in Iceland or something.

41:01.460 --> 41:02.792
- Nope, nothing.

41:02.794 --> 41:05.962
Uh, just lost myself
in the big city.

41:05.964 --> 41:08.097
- You and me both, kid.

41:08.099 --> 41:10.400
It's good to see you.

41:10.402 --> 41:12.635
- There comes a
time to be found.

41:12.637 --> 41:14.838
- There comes a
time to be found.

41:18.076 --> 41:19.876
You know...

41:22.980 --> 41:27.784
I've been chasing this car
since I was your age. 26 years.

41:27.786 --> 41:30.854
I first saw her
when Kelly was a baby.

41:30.856 --> 41:32.455
I didn't have any money.

41:32.457 --> 41:34.858
I've been tracking
her ever since,

41:34.860 --> 41:37.961
every owner, every city
she's ever been in.

41:37.963 --> 41:41.998
I almost traded my cup rings
from the show for her once.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.334
But it was worth the wait, Tim.

41:45.769 --> 41:48.338
When I got my chance, I pounced.

41:48.340 --> 41:51.474
You could definitely deliver
pizzas in a hurry in this.

41:51.476 --> 41:53.343
- Uh, I guess you've been doing

41:53.345 --> 41:55.812
a little better than me
since the cup year.

41:55.814 --> 41:57.480
- I do okay.

41:57.482 --> 42:00.550
But winning's been a
little harder to come by

42:00.552 --> 42:02.218
when you weren't around.

42:02.220 --> 42:05.688
- Winning's been harder to come
by when hockey wasn't around.

42:06.691 --> 42:09.058
- Well, you must've
done all right.

42:09.060 --> 42:10.994
You look good, son.

42:10.996 --> 42:14.497
- You know, not so sure about
this guy she's with, coach.

42:14.499 --> 42:17.667
- You didn't expect her to
wait around forever, did you?

42:17.669 --> 42:19.402
- Well, this car waited for you.

42:19.404 --> 42:22.505
- This car didn't wait for me.
I finally caught up to her.

42:22.507 --> 42:24.173
If I was a little smarter,

42:24.175 --> 42:28.244
I might've been able to spend
a little more time with her.

42:28.246 --> 42:31.180
- Yeah, you hear
she proposed to him?

42:31.182 --> 42:34.017
- I sure did! I actually
kind of liked it.

42:34.019 --> 42:36.152
She's a take-charge
kind of girl.

42:38.156 --> 42:41.858
- What kind of name
is Winston, anyway?

42:41.860 --> 42:44.027
- Tim, flowers is not like us.

42:44.029 --> 42:45.995
He treats her well, though.

42:45.997 --> 42:47.196
- Treats her well.

42:47.198 --> 42:49.232
Well, this car treats you well.

42:49.234 --> 42:51.034
You're not gonna marry it.

42:52.571 --> 42:55.371
- This car has rushed
more blood to my dick

42:55.373 --> 42:57.574
than any woman in
the last 5 years!

42:57.576 --> 42:59.509
I would if I could!

43:00.778 --> 43:03.947
- Hey, rally up, boys!
Brunch is ready.

43:14.258 --> 43:15.458
- Oh!

43:15.460 --> 43:16.926
- Oh! Allow me.

43:16.928 --> 43:18.027
- What?

43:18.029 --> 43:20.597
- Winston, how about
those beers?

43:26.537 --> 43:28.538
- How rude of us, gentlemen.

43:28.540 --> 43:31.975
What about you, Kelly?
Just milk, right?

43:31.977 --> 43:35.144
- Yeah. Not a bad memory
for a hockey player!

43:35.146 --> 43:39.115
- Ah, hell! Tim was one of the
brightest players in the game!

43:39.117 --> 43:41.818
- Well, luckily the brain
deterioration isn't as bad

43:41.820 --> 43:42.919
as it is in football.

43:42.921 --> 43:44.787
You ever feel like
you have dementia

43:44.789 --> 43:47.624
or that you're somewhere where
you shouldn't be, Timothy?

43:47.626 --> 43:50.059
- Oh, thankfully, I had a
career-ending leg injury

43:50.061 --> 43:51.294
when I was young.

43:51.296 --> 43:53.429
But I appreciate
your concern, Winston,

43:53.431 --> 43:55.365
and I am exactly
where I should be.

44:04.008 --> 44:05.642
This looks great, Kel.

44:05.644 --> 44:07.644
- Mm-hmm!
Fantastic, Kelly!

44:07.646 --> 44:09.412
You've really outdone yourself!

44:09.414 --> 44:11.948
- She always was a whiz
in the kitchen.

44:11.950 --> 44:14.083
- Oh, even more so now,
I'm sure!

44:14.085 --> 44:17.120
The dishes you come up with,
honey, are out of this world!

44:17.122 --> 44:18.521
- I'm sure they are!

44:18.523 --> 44:22.158
You know, it was always me
the prodigy on the ice

44:22.160 --> 44:24.627
and Kel the prodigy off the ice.

44:24.629 --> 44:26.929
- Well, Kelly's a
very talented woman,

44:26.931 --> 44:28.464
and I'm a lucky guy.

44:28.466 --> 44:29.766
- You sure are, Winston.

44:29.768 --> 44:31.267
You sure are!

44:31.269 --> 44:32.502
- Alright, then!

44:32.504 --> 44:34.604
Let's all, uh, dig in!

44:34.606 --> 44:37.473
- Before that,
let's have a toast

44:37.475 --> 44:40.443
to someone who I owe
a lot of that luck to.

44:40.445 --> 44:41.778
To Tim!

44:41.780 --> 44:43.713
- That's a fine
sentiment, Winston.

44:43.715 --> 44:45.481
To Tim!

44:45.483 --> 44:47.784
- To Tim, for choosing
to run away

44:47.786 --> 44:50.453
when things got a little tough.

44:50.455 --> 44:53.156
- Excuse me, flowers?

44:53.158 --> 44:56.292
I don't think you have any idea.

44:56.294 --> 44:58.027
- Oh, but I think I do.

44:58.029 --> 44:59.729
- The food, gentlemen!

44:59.731 --> 45:01.964
- Do we have a
problem here, flowers,

45:01.966 --> 45:04.367
if that's your real name,

45:04.369 --> 45:06.869
because we can
sort this out right now.

45:10.908 --> 45:12.675
Enough!

45:14.512 --> 45:16.412
- Enough!

45:18.015 --> 45:20.483
- She was pregnant when
you left, you asshole!

45:20.485 --> 45:21.484
Did you know that?

45:21.486 --> 45:22.852
Yeah, she had an abortion,

45:22.854 --> 45:24.587
and now she can't
have kids anymore.

45:24.589 --> 45:26.422
Do you feel good
about that, big man?

45:26.424 --> 45:28.091
- That's enough, Winston.

45:32.396 --> 45:34.831
- Oh, yeah. Leave again.
You're good at that!

45:34.833 --> 45:36.232
Who's not man enough now?

45:36.234 --> 45:38.034
- You had no right
telling him that!

45:38.036 --> 45:39.902
- He had no right
walking out on you!

45:39.904 --> 45:41.871
- He didn't know.
He had no idea!

45:41.873 --> 45:45.074
- I think he had an idea when
he put his penis in you!

45:45.076 --> 45:47.276
- Winston, take a walk.

45:47.278 --> 45:50.213
- Sir, I'm sorry, but
I don't like that man!

45:50.215 --> 45:53.549
- I don't like the way you're
talking about my daughter.

45:53.551 --> 45:55.084
Get some air, son.

45:55.086 --> 45:56.085
- He's an asshole!

45:56.087 --> 45:57.854
- You're an asshole!
Take a walk!

45:57.856 --> 45:59.055
- No, this is my house,

45:59.057 --> 46:01.057
and I can have any
opinion that I want.

46:01.059 --> 46:02.525
And I'm not going anywhere!

46:03.794 --> 46:06.829
Okay. I'll
take a walk.

46:09.533 --> 46:11.100
- Is that true?

46:13.470 --> 46:16.205
I'm sorry, Kel.
I... I didn't know.

46:17.207 --> 46:18.374
- I know.

46:20.310 --> 46:22.411
- I never stopped loving you.

46:22.413 --> 46:23.880
I hope you know that.

46:23.882 --> 46:25.448
I had to leave.

46:27.751 --> 46:30.119
I wasn't good for anyone.

46:31.655 --> 46:34.857
- I just thought you would
come back a lot sooner.

46:37.461 --> 46:38.995
- I'm sorry, coach.

46:40.330 --> 46:43.132
- You had your reasons, son.

46:43.134 --> 46:45.368
Nobody blames you.

46:46.336 --> 46:49.639
- Tell Winston I'm sorry.

46:55.312 --> 46:57.413
- Smashing!

47:50.300 --> 47:52.201
- Uh, how much was that, again?

47:52.203 --> 47:53.703
- $32.30.

47:54.905 --> 47:57.039
- All right.
I don't have a card.

47:57.041 --> 47:59.475
I don't know where it is.

48:04.548 --> 48:06.449
I'm gonna see if
I have any cash.

48:20.665 --> 48:22.665
- Whoa!

48:54.299 --> 48:57.233
Not even a fucking tip!

48:57.235 --> 48:59.101
Fuck this shit!

49:54.025 --> 49:57.693
- This looks like
the man I remember.

49:57.695 --> 49:59.362
Yeah!

50:02.766 --> 50:05.067
You're looking good, son!

50:06.036 --> 50:07.703
- Portfolio.

50:27.358 --> 50:31.327
- I want this guy brought
here by Saturday night,

50:31.329 --> 50:34.497
and I want him alive,

50:34.499 --> 50:37.466
and I want you to
kill him in front of me,

50:37.468 --> 50:40.069
and I wanna watch him squirm.

50:40.071 --> 50:42.171
- Usual deal?

50:42.173 --> 50:45.875
- There will be a
significant bonus on this one.

50:45.877 --> 50:48.077
This guy's made it personal.

50:48.079 --> 50:49.845
- I want the usual money,

50:49.847 --> 50:52.581
but for a bonus,
I wanna be left alone.

50:52.583 --> 50:54.216
This job and I'm done.

50:54.218 --> 50:56.218
I need to take care
of my brother.

50:56.220 --> 50:58.854
I can't take these
risks anymore.

50:58.856 --> 51:01.424
- Family is important.
I respect that.

51:01.426 --> 51:03.292
I'll Grant the bonus as well.

51:04.494 --> 51:06.529
And that's a brand new car

51:06.531 --> 51:10.066
so you can stop driving
that shit-box around!

51:10.068 --> 51:12.568
- If that shit-box
could talk...

51:14.704 --> 51:16.839
- It's hidden 'round back.

51:19.076 --> 51:20.676
- Assholes!

51:22.579 --> 51:25.181
- I had to make
sure you'd show up.

51:27.584 --> 51:30.286
You got 2 days, Tim.

51:33.557 --> 51:35.091
Two days.

53:21.831 --> 53:23.766
- Rough night, buddy?

53:24.834 --> 53:26.702
- Yes. No!

53:27.804 --> 53:29.505
Why? Wh... what?

53:29.507 --> 53:33.008
<i>Bobby, you little hairy bastard!</i>

53:33.010 --> 53:35.244
<i>I'm fucked, you know that?</i>

53:35.246 --> 53:38.347
<i>I love Kelly, and now
I have to kill her dad</i>

53:38.349 --> 53:40.716
<i>'cause he owes
a shit ton of cash.</i>

53:40.718 --> 53:42.985
<i>He coached like a hell of a dad!</i>

53:42.987 --> 53:44.553
<i>And now I've gotta kill him,</i>

53:44.555 --> 53:46.855
<i>because that's what I am,
I'm a killer.</i>

53:46.857 --> 53:49.425
<i>Blam, bam!
You're dead, Ma'am!</i>

53:49.427 --> 53:52.027
<i>I can't... I can't kill him.</i>

53:52.029 --> 53:54.096
<i>You know what, though?</i>

53:54.098 --> 53:56.832
<i>I gotta protect him and Kelly,</i>

53:56.834 --> 53:59.501
<i>because I'm gonna marry her</i>

53:59.503 --> 54:03.272
<i>'cause I love her and her dad
and little Matty too.</i>

54:03.274 --> 54:05.207
<i>Sorry, sorry Matthew.</i>

54:05.209 --> 54:07.009
<i>Matthew!</i>

54:10.014 --> 54:12.748
<i>You too, Bobby, buddy.</i>

54:12.750 --> 54:15.351
Mi Familia!<i> Hmm?</i>

54:15.353 --> 54:16.785
<i>So, tonight...</i>

54:18.188 --> 54:20.356
<i>Tonight, Bobby, me and you,</i>

54:20.358 --> 54:24.260
<i>we gotta do... do this charity
reunion dinner thing tonight</i>

54:24.262 --> 54:26.095
<i>to protect coach and Kelly.</i>

54:26.097 --> 54:28.931
<i>And that's... that's
all there is to it!</i>

54:30.233 --> 54:31.300
<i>I love you, buddy!</i>

54:41.044 --> 54:43.412
- So, my question for you is:

54:43.414 --> 54:46.315
Are we going to this charity
reunion dinner thingy or what?

54:46.317 --> 54:48.917
- Yeah, Bobby.
We're going.

54:48.919 --> 54:50.919
- Oh yes! Come here!

54:50.921 --> 54:51.920
- Aaah!

54:51.922 --> 54:53.155
- Kiss me! Mwah!

54:53.157 --> 54:55.257
You beautiful son of a bitch!

54:55.259 --> 54:57.059
Oh yes!
Yes, yes, yes!

54:57.061 --> 55:00.663
Oh! Guess what, Matty?
Uncle Bobby's doing it tonight!

55:00.665 --> 55:01.730
Mmm, yeah! Mmm!

55:01.732 --> 55:02.731
- Yeah.

55:02.733 --> 55:03.799
- Ah, yeah!

55:03.801 --> 55:06.068
- I read the portfolio
on your coach.

55:06.070 --> 55:09.772
You're gonna need money to
get everybody out of here fast,

55:09.774 --> 55:12.474
if you're not gonna kill him.

55:12.476 --> 55:14.343
You're not gonna
kill him, right?

55:14.345 --> 55:16.445
- No, Matty, I am
not gonna kill him.

55:16.447 --> 55:19.415
- Good, because the charity
event at the reunion game

55:19.417 --> 55:20.416
is your mark.

55:20.418 --> 55:21.583
What?

55:21.585 --> 55:23.152
- $50,000.

55:23.154 --> 55:26.822
You're playing in that game,
and you're stealing that money.

55:26.824 --> 55:28.924
- I'm listening.

55:28.926 --> 55:31.093
- You too, Bobby. You
need to be in on this.

55:31.095 --> 55:34.096
- Well, all right!
Two invites in one day.

55:34.098 --> 55:35.431
Ooh! I am flattered!

55:44.007 --> 55:45.307
- Oh!

55:45.309 --> 55:47.343
It looks like
someone is thinking

55:47.345 --> 55:49.378
somewhere fancy for date night!

55:50.347 --> 55:53.782
- Oh shit! Date night.

55:53.784 --> 55:54.983
- Don't worry.

55:54.985 --> 55:57.953
I already made a
reservation at Chez Mon Ami

55:57.955 --> 55:59.722
to make up for yesterday.

55:59.724 --> 56:03.892
You don't have to worry about
a thing because tonight, milady,

56:03.894 --> 56:06.328
you are gonna be so pampered.

56:06.330 --> 56:08.163
Oh!

56:08.165 --> 56:11.033
No, honey, tonight
is the cup reunion dinner.

56:11.035 --> 56:12.835
Remember?
I'm going with dad.

56:12.837 --> 56:14.336
- Oh, right!
Fun, fun!

56:14.338 --> 56:17.473
Oh yeah, it'll be great to see
your dad in his environment,

56:17.475 --> 56:19.208
you know, see him in all
his glory.

56:19.210 --> 56:20.476
I can't wait.

56:20.478 --> 56:22.378
- I don't think you
can really go, babe,

56:22.380 --> 56:24.213
'cause I'm his plus-one.

56:24.215 --> 56:26.849
- Well, that's fine.
I'll just be your plus-one.

56:26.851 --> 56:29.585
- I don't really think that's
the way plus-ones work.

56:29.587 --> 56:30.753
It's not like dominoes.

56:30.755 --> 56:32.755
- Yeah, you know what?
You're right.

56:32.757 --> 56:35.758
I'm just stupid in thinking
I know what a plus-one is. Huh!

56:35.760 --> 56:38.494
It's weird, because I figured
being a plus-one for life

56:38.496 --> 56:40.763
would mean I'd get to
go to dinners and such.

56:40.765 --> 56:42.097
How dumb of me!

56:42.099 --> 56:45.434
I already said I was sorry
for brunch the other day.

56:45.436 --> 56:47.503
You can't keep
penalizing me like this!

56:47.505 --> 56:50.105
- Stop being a
drama queen, Winston.

56:50.107 --> 56:52.841
- Why are you
moisturizing your legs

56:52.843 --> 56:54.710
for a date with your dad?

56:54.712 --> 56:56.612
- Don't be a pervert!

56:56.614 --> 56:59.114
- Timothy's going, isn't he?
- I'd assume so, yes.

56:59.116 --> 57:02.618
That was the year he broke
all the junior records.

57:02.620 --> 57:04.353
- Oh! Oh, I would assume so!

57:04.355 --> 57:07.890
That's the year he was probably
breaking into your panties.

57:07.892 --> 57:09.925
You know what?
I'm coming!

57:09.927 --> 57:12.127
- No. You can't.

57:12.129 --> 57:14.563
- Oh, really?
You gave me the ring.

57:14.565 --> 57:17.733
That means I'm your plus-one
for life, anywhere you are.

57:17.735 --> 57:20.769
Anywhere! That's
the point of the ring!

57:32.649 --> 57:34.149
- Jesus, Bobby!

57:34.151 --> 57:36.218
- You like? My treat!

57:36.220 --> 57:38.220
- What the fuck?

57:38.222 --> 57:41.156
I'm not accepting an
open drink from you tonight.

57:41.158 --> 57:42.491
You know that, right?

57:42.493 --> 57:43.792
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

57:43.794 --> 57:45.994
That's what all
my dates tell me.

57:50.234 --> 57:54.603
- Honey, thank you for
being so understanding.

57:54.605 --> 57:57.739
I know all of this must
be really hard on you.

57:57.741 --> 58:00.242
- Yeah, I'm... I'm
sorry about earlier.

58:00.244 --> 58:01.810
I think it's really great

58:01.812 --> 58:04.413
that you get to spend
this time with your father

58:04.415 --> 58:05.414
and everything.

58:09.652 --> 58:12.020
Mm-hmm! Love that
old man of yours.

58:13.757 --> 58:16.458
- You are one in a million.

58:16.460 --> 58:18.760
- Yeah! Have fun tonight.

58:18.762 --> 58:20.662
- Okay. You too.

58:20.664 --> 58:22.231
Bye-bye!

58:41.851 --> 58:43.752
- Kelly!

58:46.022 --> 58:48.724
Plus-one for life!

58:58.668 --> 59:01.069
<i>- Well, the candy has dropped</i>

59:01.071 --> 59:02.571
<i>on the vending machine case.</i>

59:02.573 --> 59:05.307
<i>I'm standing at ground zero,
where it's believed</i>

59:05.309 --> 59:08.710
<i>that the original victim
of the vending-machine bandit</i>

59:08.712 --> 59:10.145
<i>has finally been found.</i>

59:10.147 --> 59:12.881
<i>Detective and former Steelhawk
enforcer Bill Petcoff</i>

59:12.883 --> 59:15.417
<i>attributes this find
to taking things day by day</i>

59:15.419 --> 59:16.818
<i>and one shift at a time.</i>

59:16.820 --> 59:19.354
<i>Now, it's hoped that
the puck will stop here</i>

59:19.356 --> 59:21.757
<i>once forensics gets back
from the coroner</i>

59:21.759 --> 59:24.560
<i>and that Petcoff will
get the firepower he needs</i>

59:24.562 --> 59:27.663
<i>to put this decades-old mystery
to rest once and for all.</i>

59:27.665 --> 59:30.832
<i>Now, for those who have missed
out on the easy convenience</i>

59:30.834 --> 59:33.268
<i>of snacks, cigarettes
and even hot chocolate,</i>

59:33.270 --> 59:35.437
<i>our hearts and prayers
are with you.</i>

59:35.439 --> 59:39.374
- What the hell's next?
Teddy bear burglars?

59:39.376 --> 59:42.911
The criminal element in
this town is embarrassing!

59:45.014 --> 59:48.016
<i>- Oh, heartbreaking.
Uh, thanks, Belinda.</i>

59:48.018 --> 59:51.887
<i>Um, well, the city has been
talking about this weekend</i>

59:51.889 --> 59:53.355
<i>for a long time.</i>

59:53.357 --> 59:56.858
<i>And now that it's here,
the excitement is electric,</i>

59:56.860 --> 59:59.361
<i>especially since
we've just heard</i>

59:59.363 --> 01:00:02.798
<i>that local legend
Tim Tucker has just arrived.</i>

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:06.735
- What are you gonna tell coach?

01:00:06.737 --> 01:00:10.138
- Nothing. The less
he knows the better.

01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:13.175
I don't want him doing
anything stupid.

01:00:15.578 --> 01:00:17.613
- Okay!

01:00:17.615 --> 01:00:18.814
<i>Monsieur!</i>

01:00:20.084 --> 01:00:22.084
Giddy the fuck up!

01:00:50.648 --> 01:00:52.814
<i>- I'm here with former prodigy</i>

01:00:52.816 --> 01:00:55.250
<i>and local legend for life</i>

01:00:55.252 --> 01:00:58.153
<i>Tim Tucker along with
his former coach...</i>

01:00:58.155 --> 01:01:01.623
- Hey, bubba, check this out!

01:01:01.625 --> 01:01:03.759
-<i> ...to celebrate</i>

01:01:03.761 --> 01:01:05.694
<i>the pre-eminent
sporting event</i>

01:01:05.696 --> 01:01:07.162
<i>in Hamilton history,</i>

01:01:07.164 --> 01:01:09.131
<i>the Sterling cup championship!</i>

01:01:09.133 --> 01:01:11.133
<i>Tim, how does it feel</i>

01:01:11.135 --> 01:01:13.035
<i>to be here 10 years later?</i>

01:01:13.037 --> 01:01:15.137
<i>- Uh, you know, it feels great.</i>

01:01:15.139 --> 01:01:17.873
<i>It's amazing to see
the community come out</i>

01:01:17.875 --> 01:01:19.541
<i>like it did 10 years ago.</i>

01:01:19.543 --> 01:01:21.777
<i>It shows that
the bonds back then</i>

01:01:21.779 --> 01:01:23.211
<i>still continue today.</i>

01:01:23.213 --> 01:01:24.646
<i>So, real great.</i>

01:01:24.648 --> 01:01:27.182
<i>- Fantastic.
And how's the knee?</i>

01:01:27.184 --> 01:01:29.685
<i>- It's, uh, yeah,
it's well, thanks.</i>

01:01:29.687 --> 01:01:32.287
<i>- Any chance for
a Tim Tucker comeback?</i>

01:01:32.289 --> 01:01:33.722
<i>- Uh, no, no.
I'm too old.</i>

01:01:33.724 --> 01:01:35.290
<i>Players here are too good.</i>

01:01:35.292 --> 01:01:37.993
<i>Just happy to have been
part of something special.</i>

01:01:37.995 --> 01:01:40.629
<i>- Well, you... you look
in terrific shape</i>

01:01:40.631 --> 01:01:43.198
<i>and ready for something special.</i>

01:01:44.702 --> 01:01:48.070
<i>Coach, you stepped away
from the game for a while.</i>

01:01:48.072 --> 01:01:50.172
<i>What's life been like for you</i>

01:01:50.174 --> 01:01:53.709
<i>ever since that breathtaking
run to the championship?</i>

01:01:53.711 --> 01:01:55.210
<i>- It's been a fun ride.</i>

01:01:55.212 --> 01:01:56.411
<i>You know,</i>

01:01:56.413 --> 01:01:59.247
<i>I have a beautiful
and successful daughter.</i>

01:01:59.249 --> 01:02:01.083
<i>It's really great to be here</i>

01:02:01.085 --> 01:02:02.718
<i>with her and Tim tonight.</i>

01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:04.186
<i>It's all about family.</i>

01:02:04.188 --> 01:02:07.489
<i>We're looking forward
to a great weekend together.</i>

01:02:07.491 --> 01:02:09.057
-<i> There you have it:</i>

01:02:09.059 --> 01:02:12.360
<i>Family, community
and team spirit.</i>

01:02:12.362 --> 01:02:16.198
<i>Truly inspiring
then, now and into the future.</i>

01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:17.733
<i>And don't forget,</i>

01:02:17.735 --> 01:02:20.769
<i>due to the success
of the charity fundraiser,</i>

01:02:20.771 --> 01:02:23.939
<i>there will be
one lucky $50,000 winner</i>

01:02:23.941 --> 01:02:26.241
<i>at tomorrow's hockey game.</i>

01:02:26.243 --> 01:02:27.776
<i>So be sure to come out.</i>

01:02:27.778 --> 01:02:29.578
<i>Oh, back to you, Diane.</i>

01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:30.679
<i>- Back to you, Diane.</i>

01:02:30.681 --> 01:02:31.680
-<i> Huh?</i>

01:02:31.682 --> 01:02:32.681
-<i> Hello!</i>

01:02:32.683 --> 01:02:34.282
- Give me my phone.

01:02:35.552 --> 01:02:38.653
No, no, no! Don't stop!
Just grab my phone, okay?

01:02:42.226 --> 01:02:47.429
The daughter of your coach

01:02:47.431 --> 01:02:50.132
sure has

01:02:50.134 --> 01:02:54.770
a pretty face.

01:02:57.140 --> 01:03:01.943
I'd hate to

01:03:01.945 --> 01:03:05.947
mess it up.

01:03:08.284 --> 01:03:09.484
Smiley face.

01:03:09.486 --> 01:03:12.487
<i>- There was the
championship that season.</i>

01:03:12.489 --> 01:03:15.624
But before that was awarded,
there was someone

01:03:15.626 --> 01:03:18.593
who broke every single
junior scoring record.

01:03:18.595 --> 01:03:21.263
And they still stand
to this day!

01:03:24.935 --> 01:03:29.137
Of course I'm talking
about Tim Tucker!

01:03:36.946 --> 01:03:39.447
Now, let's all take
a trip down memory Lane

01:03:39.449 --> 01:03:40.982
and watch a guy

01:03:40.984 --> 01:03:43.485
that not only was one
of the greatest players

01:03:43.487 --> 01:03:45.187
to ever play in this city,

01:03:45.189 --> 01:03:46.822
but in any city, anywhere!

01:04:42.179 --> 01:04:43.578
- Ten!

01:04:44.714 --> 01:04:48.016
Ten years, Tucker.
Ten years.

01:04:48.018 --> 01:04:50.185
- I'm s-sorry!

01:04:50.187 --> 01:04:52.988
- Come dance with me
once your balls drop.

01:04:52.990 --> 01:04:54.189
- Yeah, okay.

01:04:55.692 --> 01:04:59.327
- Tim Tucker, you
good-looking son of a bitch!

01:04:59.329 --> 01:05:01.229
You need some help over there?

01:05:01.231 --> 01:05:02.931
Just like old times, buddy.

01:05:02.933 --> 01:05:04.099
- Yep.

01:05:54.251 --> 01:05:56.318
- Wow! Your
dancing's improved.

01:05:56.320 --> 01:06:00.255
- Bad knee helps you focus on
only the necessary movements.

01:06:02.225 --> 01:06:04.960
- How are your, uh,
balls? They doing okay?

01:06:04.962 --> 01:06:07.162
- They deserved it.

01:06:07.164 --> 01:06:08.730
- Right.

01:06:08.732 --> 01:06:11.599
- How did you end up
ever getting engaged?

01:06:11.601 --> 01:06:13.768
- Men wanna make babies with me.

01:06:13.770 --> 01:06:15.603
- Poor bastards!

01:06:15.605 --> 01:06:16.905
- I know!

01:06:17.907 --> 01:06:19.574
- I love you.

01:06:19.576 --> 01:06:21.309
- Dip me.

01:06:27.951 --> 01:06:31.453
- Thanks for saving my girl
from drowning, Timothy.

01:06:31.455 --> 01:06:32.988
- Your lady?
- Mm-hmm.

01:06:32.990 --> 01:06:34.656
Or plus-one or whatever.

01:06:34.658 --> 01:06:37.759
- Funny, I don't remember
you from 10 years ago.

01:06:37.761 --> 01:06:39.527
Maybe you shouldn't be here

01:06:39.529 --> 01:06:41.196
or you have dementia.

01:06:41.198 --> 01:06:44.933
- No, no, no. I have
the ring of power.

01:06:44.935 --> 01:06:46.668
Yeah! Plus-one guy!

01:06:47.804 --> 01:06:49.137
Plus-one for life.

01:06:49.139 --> 01:06:50.972
- Okay, we were just
dancing, Winston.

01:06:50.974 --> 01:06:52.974
- Dipping. You were
dipping, sweetheart.

01:06:52.976 --> 01:06:55.377
- You've got nothing
to worry about, flowers.

01:06:55.379 --> 01:06:56.444
Let's man this out.

01:06:56.446 --> 01:06:57.712
Come on, get up in here.

01:06:57.714 --> 01:06:58.713
- All right.

01:07:00.217 --> 01:07:01.383
Oh!

01:07:02.719 --> 01:07:04.786
- Hey, don't!
Leave him alone. He's okay.

01:07:04.788 --> 01:07:06.388
- Damn right, I'm okay.

01:07:06.390 --> 01:07:07.689
I'm the best!

01:07:16.332 --> 01:07:18.133
- Moonwalk?

01:07:18.135 --> 01:07:20.735
I'm beginning to
like that guy. Fuck!

01:07:32.014 --> 01:07:33.648
- Did you get the money?

01:07:33.650 --> 01:07:36.151
- I emptied his
bank account today.

01:07:36.153 --> 01:07:38.253
$50,000, like I thought.

01:07:38.255 --> 01:07:39.254
- Where is it?

01:07:39.256 --> 01:07:40.755
- In the trunk of your car.

01:07:42.225 --> 01:07:45.360
- You think Tim's ready
to steal the other 50 tomorrow?

01:07:45.362 --> 01:07:48.029
- I think he's about ready
to do anything for me.

01:07:48.031 --> 01:07:50.832
- What Winston said must
have crushed the poor boy.

01:07:50.834 --> 01:07:53.601
- Yeah, well, we knew
that Winston was a dick

01:07:53.603 --> 01:07:55.403
when I asked him to marry me.

01:07:56.873 --> 01:07:59.140
But, uh, I think
Tim's changed, though.

01:08:00.342 --> 01:08:03.344
- You're not falling
for him, are you?

01:08:03.346 --> 01:08:06.614
Now, this boy hasn't
thought of anyone but himself

01:08:06.616 --> 01:08:08.616
since his injury.

01:08:09.552 --> 01:08:10.618
- No! No, dad!

01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:12.587
I'm just saying
he's more like the Tim

01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:14.622
that he was before
the injury, you know?

01:08:14.624 --> 01:08:17.459
Like when he would do anything
for anyone on his team.

01:08:17.461 --> 01:08:20.060
- He abandoned us, honey.

01:08:20.063 --> 01:08:22.263
- I know.

01:08:24.633 --> 01:08:27.167
- Okay, okay.

01:08:28.136 --> 01:08:29.671
Now, anything else?

01:08:30.738 --> 01:08:32.573
Let's focus on the task at hand.

01:08:32.576 --> 01:08:35.443
Um, have you noticed
anything suspicious in town?

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:38.947
- Uh, a couple of big guys
at the bar the other night,

01:08:38.948 --> 01:08:42.149
but I don't think they had
much between their ears.

01:08:42.152 --> 01:08:44.819
- Sonny might be around.
You be careful.

01:08:44.821 --> 01:08:47.622
- Did you contact him
about the money yet?

01:08:47.624 --> 01:08:51.259
- No, no. I'm waiting
till I get the other 50.

01:08:51.261 --> 01:08:54.395
- Okay. Hey!

01:08:56.966 --> 01:09:00.135
We got this, dad. Okay?

01:09:00.136 --> 01:09:02.670
- Yeah. Good.

01:09:02.671 --> 01:09:03.805
- Okay.

01:09:13.682 --> 01:09:16.518
- Maple whiskey,
and keep them coming.

01:09:19.755 --> 01:09:21.356
That's right.

01:09:23.192 --> 01:09:25.059
Good party!

01:09:30.867 --> 01:09:35.170
- I'm sorry, sir, but your card
seems to have been declined.

01:09:36.205 --> 01:09:38.872
- Oh, Jesus!
Wha... how?

01:09:55.157 --> 01:09:57.792
- Please lay off the balls.

01:10:01.330 --> 01:10:06.234
- I'm really, uh, sorry about
the way things have turned out.

01:10:10.005 --> 01:10:11.906
But we need to talk.

01:10:17.513 --> 01:10:19.581
Is there somewhere we can go?

01:10:21.884 --> 01:10:23.651
He's in a lot of trouble.

01:10:23.653 --> 01:10:25.253
He owes a lot of money.

01:10:25.255 --> 01:10:26.487
- Really?

01:10:26.489 --> 01:10:27.822
- Gambling.

01:10:27.824 --> 01:10:29.557
- Really?

01:10:29.559 --> 01:10:33.061
- He needs help.
He needs money, fast.

01:10:33.063 --> 01:10:34.062
- Really?

01:10:34.064 --> 01:10:35.163
- Yes, Tim, really.

01:10:35.165 --> 01:10:36.164
- Really?

01:10:36.166 --> 01:10:37.332
- Yes! Fucking really!

01:10:37.334 --> 01:10:38.499
- What can I do?

01:10:39.703 --> 01:10:42.270
- Okay, there's a giveaway
happening tomorrow night

01:10:42.272 --> 01:10:43.538
at the charity event.

01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:46.107
I wanna steal it. But we
need help on the inside.

01:10:46.109 --> 01:10:48.376
- I'm playing.
I'll be on the inside.

01:10:48.378 --> 01:10:49.410
- Really?

01:10:49.412 --> 01:10:50.545
- Really.

01:10:50.547 --> 01:10:52.780
- You think you
can get the money?

01:10:52.782 --> 01:10:55.049
- I think I can
come up with a plan.

01:10:55.051 --> 01:10:58.353
- If you do this, I will
make it worth your while.

01:10:58.355 --> 01:11:00.622
- $50,000 worth
is a lot of while.

01:11:00.624 --> 01:11:04.125
- I'll be over tonight,
and you can tell me the plan.

01:11:04.127 --> 01:11:05.326
- Really?

01:11:15.137 --> 01:11:16.871
- You're a good man...

01:11:17.906 --> 01:11:19.474
But a very, very bad man.

01:11:20.543 --> 01:11:21.976
Do you know what I'm saying?

01:11:21.978 --> 01:11:23.444
- Not really, no.

01:11:23.446 --> 01:11:24.946
- Ying and Yang, man!

01:11:24.948 --> 01:11:27.148
That's what I'm talking about.

01:11:27.150 --> 01:11:28.383
Ying-Yang man.

01:11:28.385 --> 01:11:30.885
That's what I'm gonna
call you from now on.

01:11:30.887 --> 01:11:33.988
But don't you worry, coach,
'cause I got you covered.

01:11:33.990 --> 01:11:36.391
- I have no idea what
you're talking about,

01:11:36.393 --> 01:11:38.059
but that's real swell, Bob.

01:11:43.565 --> 01:11:45.900
Good luck tomorrow.

01:11:45.902 --> 01:11:48.770
And, uh, I should say,
we got you covered.

01:11:48.772 --> 01:11:50.772
Don't you worry about a thing.

01:11:50.774 --> 01:11:52.440
- It's a legends game.

01:11:52.442 --> 01:11:55.343
There's not much at
stake, but thanks.

01:12:01.483 --> 01:12:04.319
- Oh! Not much at stake!

01:12:04.321 --> 01:12:06.154
You're funny, coach!

01:12:07.490 --> 01:12:10.425
- Okay! I'm going
somewhere else.

01:12:12.294 --> 01:12:15.596
- Oh! Okay, you go
somewhere else, coach!

01:12:15.598 --> 01:12:17.965
That's where we're all gonna go.

01:12:17.967 --> 01:12:20.835
People... people
respect this... this dick.

01:12:20.837 --> 01:12:22.770
This dick and balls!

01:12:25.441 --> 01:12:28.609
Mmm! Can I get
another one, please?

01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:35.149
Yeah, that makes sense. Okay.

01:12:35.151 --> 01:12:36.851
Ah!

01:12:43.526 --> 01:12:46.027
You guys got
any triumph in here?

01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:50.198
- No, you go to hell!

01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:52.800
No, I think you
are a crook and a jerk,

01:12:52.802 --> 01:12:55.970
and I really am not gonna
do any more business with you.

01:12:55.972 --> 01:12:57.305
Goodbye!

01:12:57.307 --> 01:12:59.173
- What seems to be
the problem, Winston?

01:12:59.175 --> 01:13:01.642
- The bank says I have no
more money in my account.

01:13:01.644 --> 01:13:02.710
- That's ridiculous!

01:13:02.712 --> 01:13:04.245
Now, let's go back to the house,

01:13:04.247 --> 01:13:05.913
and we'll figure
this out, buddy.

01:13:05.915 --> 01:13:08.249
- They wouldn't even give
me a drink at the bar.

01:13:08.251 --> 01:13:10.151
- Plenty of maple
whiskey at your place.

01:13:10.153 --> 01:13:11.386
Let's get out of here.

01:13:11.388 --> 01:13:12.687
- Sure thing, Mr. Quinn.

01:13:12.689 --> 01:13:13.821
- Coach.

01:13:13.823 --> 01:13:15.256
- All right, coach!

01:13:16.326 --> 01:13:17.592
Coach. I like it!

01:13:26.001 --> 01:13:27.201
Honey?

01:13:36.545 --> 01:13:38.546
Kelly? What the fuck?

01:13:40.016 --> 01:13:42.850
- Okay, pops.
You good here?

01:13:42.852 --> 01:13:44.252
- Ah!

01:13:44.254 --> 01:13:45.586
I'm just grateful

01:13:45.588 --> 01:13:48.356
for a night without
flowers' incessant banter.

01:13:49.526 --> 01:13:50.691
Thanks, honey.

01:13:50.693 --> 01:13:52.427
- Okay, well, I'm going to Tim's,

01:13:52.429 --> 01:13:54.429
so I will see
you in the morning.

01:13:54.431 --> 01:13:56.431
- Ah! Goodnight, sweetie.

01:13:57.533 --> 01:13:58.800
I'm proud of you.

01:13:58.802 --> 01:14:01.402
- Thanks, dad.
Goodnight.

01:14:01.404 --> 01:14:02.804
- Goodnight.

01:14:02.806 --> 01:14:03.805
- Night, Winston.

01:14:03.807 --> 01:14:05.373
Goodnight, Kelly.

01:14:16.552 --> 01:14:20.321
- It's pretty weird
being back here like this.

01:14:20.323 --> 01:14:23.724
- Name one thing that wasn't
weird about tonight.

01:14:25.561 --> 01:14:29.163
- Bobby motor-boating
on the dance floor?

01:14:30.499 --> 01:14:32.900
- I'm glad I
delivered you pizza.

01:14:35.637 --> 01:14:38.806
- I kind of ordered
from you on purpose.

01:14:40.809 --> 01:14:45.179
The girl who works there is the
daughter of one of my clients.

01:14:49.485 --> 01:14:52.186
It took 3 tries
before you delivered.

01:14:54.756 --> 01:14:56.357
- Deviant.

01:15:00.963 --> 01:15:03.831
I kind of knew your dad
owes the mob a lot of money.

01:15:03.833 --> 01:15:05.633
- I kind of never
had an abortion.

01:15:05.635 --> 01:15:07.768
- I kind of used to
work for the mob.

01:15:07.770 --> 01:15:10.872
- I kind of always wanted to use
you to get the money tomorrow.

01:15:10.874 --> 01:15:13.541
- Well, I kind of was already
planning on stealing it.

01:15:13.543 --> 01:15:16.310
- I kind of have Winston
tied up in my house right now.

01:15:16.312 --> 01:15:18.346
- It kind of was hard
to kill your father.

01:15:18.348 --> 01:15:20.715
- I kind of used Winston
just to siphon the money.

01:15:20.717 --> 01:15:22.850
- The guy after your dad
is kind of in town.

01:15:22.852 --> 01:15:24.719
- I kind of wanna kill that guy!

01:15:24.721 --> 01:15:26.521
- I kind of never got over you.

01:15:26.523 --> 01:15:28.489
- I kind of never got over you.

01:15:28.491 --> 01:15:30.057
- What are we gonna do?

01:15:30.993 --> 01:15:32.460
Win!

01:16:34.756 --> 01:16:36.691
- Uh, hi!

01:16:39.861 --> 01:16:41.429
- Hi!

01:16:45.534 --> 01:16:47.868
That was a hell of a
plan you came up with!

01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:49.437
- Oh, thanks!

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:54.709
- You're doing some
casual reading, I see?

01:16:54.711 --> 01:16:56.210
- This is just stupid.

01:16:56.212 --> 01:16:59.413
Numbers are easier
than words, I guess.

01:16:59.415 --> 01:17:04.418
So, you're no longer
the ex-girlfriend, I guess?

01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:06.587
- Wow, ex-girlfriend!

01:17:06.589 --> 01:17:09.123
That sounds like a
high-ranking status.

01:17:09.125 --> 01:17:11.759
I don't know if I wanna
lose a title like that.

01:17:15.297 --> 01:17:18.399
- I mean...
So, I mean...

01:17:18.401 --> 01:17:22.703
Y-you guys are
doing it again?

01:17:23.672 --> 01:17:25.539
- Um...

01:17:27.809 --> 01:17:30.177
Have you ever kissed
a girl, Matthew?

01:17:32.447 --> 01:17:36.283
- Uh, no, no.

01:17:36.285 --> 01:17:40.755
Girls don't usually,
like, notice me.

01:17:40.757 --> 01:17:42.189
Um...

01:17:44.259 --> 01:17:46.427
But thank you.

01:17:47.796 --> 01:17:49.830
- For what?

01:17:49.832 --> 01:17:51.499
- For calling me Matthew.

01:17:51.501 --> 01:17:54.368
Tim usually just calls
me Matty, and I don't get it.

01:17:54.370 --> 01:17:56.971
You know, what's the point?
It's still 2 syllables.

01:17:56.973 --> 01:17:59.507
- Yeah. It's 'cause
he's a hockey player.

01:18:01.644 --> 01:18:06.347
- What does it feel like
to... do it?

01:18:07.849 --> 01:18:10.651
- Um...

01:18:10.653 --> 01:18:15.222
I guess, uh, if you're
with the right person,

01:18:15.224 --> 01:18:18.626
it feels perfect...

01:18:20.462 --> 01:18:24.065
Like, um, like you shouldn't
be anywhere else...

01:18:26.202 --> 01:18:28.235
like you belong.

01:18:29.971 --> 01:18:33.808
- I never really felt
like I belonged anywhere.

01:18:33.810 --> 01:18:35.776
It's time to go.

01:18:38.547 --> 01:18:40.247
You're staying here, Matty.

01:18:40.249 --> 01:18:41.816
- I wanna help.
Let me help!

01:18:41.818 --> 01:18:44.418
- It's too dangerous.
I can't risk it.

01:18:44.420 --> 01:18:47.154
You're the only family
I've got left, huh?

01:18:49.224 --> 01:18:50.825
- Bye, Matthew.

01:19:07.743 --> 01:19:09.877
- Thanks! Go hawks!

01:21:03.225 --> 01:21:06.026
Holy frackin' goal!

01:21:06.028 --> 01:21:09.530
Tim Tucker has called out
Steph Dalmayo

01:21:09.532 --> 01:21:12.499
and is looking to settle
the score from 10 years ago.

01:21:12.501 --> 01:21:15.135
Buckle up, everybody!
Here we go!

01:21:16.539 --> 01:21:19.306
He lands with a couple
of rights straight on,

01:21:19.308 --> 01:21:20.474
and down he goes!

01:21:20.476 --> 01:21:23.077
Dalmayo has dropped!
Lights out!

01:21:24.513 --> 01:21:26.247
The crowd is on its feet,

01:21:26.249 --> 01:21:28.883
cheering on their
former hometown hero

01:21:28.885 --> 01:21:30.718
like so many times before.

01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:34.555
Drink it in, number 9!
Drink it in!

01:21:34.557 --> 01:21:38.726
It's been a long,
long time coming.

01:22:45.728 --> 01:22:48.128
- Have you seen a little girl?

01:22:48.130 --> 01:22:49.596
I can't find my daughter.

01:22:49.598 --> 01:22:52.066
- Whoa! Look, this is a pretty
big place, all right?

01:22:52.068 --> 01:22:54.335
You guys should let
the office know immediately.

01:22:54.337 --> 01:22:56.570
- That girl is the most
important thing to me!

01:22:56.572 --> 01:22:59.239
- That little girl's the most
important thing to me!

01:22:59.241 --> 01:23:02.142
- Nineteen hours of labour
will attach anybody to anyone.

01:23:02.144 --> 01:23:05.245
I... I haven't been apart
from her this long for ever!

01:23:12.354 --> 01:23:16.957
- One of our 3 lucky contestants
chosen from the crowd

01:23:16.959 --> 01:23:21.428
will walk away today
with $50,000!

01:23:24.767 --> 01:23:26.867
Starting from
the opposing blue line,

01:23:26.869 --> 01:23:30.170
they will be attempting to
shoot the puck through the hole

01:23:30.172 --> 01:23:32.239
and into the net
at the other end.

01:23:36.544 --> 01:23:38.012
- Hey!

01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:40.681
Bottom of the handbag.

01:23:42.450 --> 01:23:43.884
- Ah!

01:23:43.886 --> 01:23:45.886
- Booyah!
- Make sure we're good outside.

01:23:45.888 --> 01:23:47.287
- Oh, I will.

01:23:49.125 --> 01:23:51.191
- I got it.

01:23:53.229 --> 01:23:55.029
- Holy shit!

01:23:56.699 --> 01:23:57.965
- Bob!

01:23:57.967 --> 01:23:59.299
Coach?

01:23:59.301 --> 01:24:01.235
What the hell
did you hit me for?

01:24:01.237 --> 01:24:03.237
- To knock out
the security guard.

01:24:03.239 --> 01:24:04.738
- Do I look like security?

01:24:04.740 --> 01:24:06.473
- You're wearing the clothes!

01:24:06.475 --> 01:24:09.343
- They told me you were
in on this, this morning.

01:24:09.345 --> 01:24:13.213
- I am! I assume since you were
involved, it didn't go smoothly.

01:24:15.250 --> 01:24:16.483
Sweetie?

01:24:16.485 --> 01:24:18.385
- Yeah. It's all
good, dad, okay?

01:24:18.387 --> 01:24:20.054
I'm gonna go after the car.

01:24:20.056 --> 01:24:22.156
You go with this,
uh, motley crew.

01:24:23.726 --> 01:24:27.428
- With you as captain, I don't
have to worry about anything.

01:24:27.430 --> 01:24:29.029
- That's right.

01:24:31.033 --> 01:24:32.433
- Let's see the money.

01:24:32.435 --> 01:24:34.101
- We got it.

01:24:34.103 --> 01:24:37.504
- Okay. Good job.
Now, hand it over.

01:24:37.506 --> 01:24:39.339
- There's still
a lot to be done.

01:24:39.341 --> 01:24:42.676
- I can handle it. I just need
that money and I'll be fine.

01:24:42.678 --> 01:24:45.112
- Really? Because I was
hired to kill you.

01:24:45.114 --> 01:24:48.449
If someone else took the
contract, you'd be dead by now.

01:24:48.451 --> 01:24:51.385
- You gonna let this
clown handle the money?

01:24:51.387 --> 01:24:52.786
- I'm right here.

01:24:52.788 --> 01:24:55.689
- If we stick to the plan,
we'll get through this.

01:24:55.691 --> 01:24:57.191
I owe you that much.

01:24:58.426 --> 01:24:59.927
Hurry.

01:25:03.598 --> 01:25:06.200
- Ladies and gentleman,

01:25:06.202 --> 01:25:09.470
the grand prize has arrived!

01:25:10.438 --> 01:25:14.274
- Hey! You didn't see anything.

01:25:26.254 --> 01:25:27.921
Oh!

01:25:27.923 --> 01:25:31.325
- Oh! We're getting close now!

01:25:33.963 --> 01:25:36.430
- And the best thing
you can name

01:25:36.432 --> 01:25:38.265
is the good old hockey game!

01:25:38.267 --> 01:25:41.969
Second verse, same as the first.

01:25:45.107 --> 01:25:46.673
- I'm in love
with your daughter.

01:25:46.675 --> 01:25:47.908
- I know that!

01:25:47.910 --> 01:25:49.977
- I'd like to ask for
her hand in marriage,

01:25:49.979 --> 01:25:51.178
if it's all right.

01:25:51.180 --> 01:25:52.646
- I don't like your lifestyle.

01:25:52.648 --> 01:25:55.282
- Coming from a degenerate
gambler and shitty crook,

01:25:55.284 --> 01:25:57.484
I can't help but
feel a little hurt.

01:25:57.486 --> 01:25:59.353
- I appreciate the irony, Tim.

01:25:59.355 --> 01:26:02.322
- Yeah, you should know
that before this, I was done.

01:26:02.324 --> 01:26:04.458
It's been a very
confusing time for me,

01:26:04.460 --> 01:26:06.426
with you, Kelly,
the reunion, Sonny...

01:26:06.428 --> 01:26:09.029
My head's been a mess.
You have to understand that.

01:26:09.031 --> 01:26:10.797
- Happens to be
my specialty, Tim.

01:26:10.799 --> 01:26:12.866
- Good, because now,
I'm seeing clearly.

01:26:12.868 --> 01:26:14.801
After this, I'm
gonna change my path.

01:26:14.803 --> 01:26:15.802
Give back.

01:26:15.804 --> 01:26:16.803
- How?

01:26:16.805 --> 01:26:18.772
- I don't know,
but I'm done taking.

01:26:18.774 --> 01:26:20.440
From here on, it's about giving.

01:26:20.442 --> 01:26:21.775
- Good for you!

01:26:28.017 --> 01:26:30.317
- It's in!
We have a winner!

01:26:30.319 --> 01:26:34.555
Get on over here, and let's
get the hawks over here.

01:26:41.730 --> 01:26:43.530
- Hey! Can I get
a gun, please?

01:26:43.532 --> 01:26:46.667
Creepy singing guy sounds like
he wants to slay people.

01:26:46.669 --> 01:26:48.202
He even knows all the lyrics!

01:27:04.185 --> 01:27:05.652
- Ha!

01:27:07.188 --> 01:27:10.090
I've never seen you
hesitate before, Timmy.

01:27:10.092 --> 01:27:12.359
- I'm a changed man, Sonny.

01:27:12.361 --> 01:27:14.494
- Yeah, sure you are, Timbits.

01:27:14.496 --> 01:27:16.530
- Coach has the money, Sonny.

01:27:16.532 --> 01:27:18.065
- You got, what?
50 grand?

01:27:18.067 --> 01:27:19.066
That's only half.

01:27:19.068 --> 01:27:21.001
- We've got the other half too.

01:27:21.003 --> 01:27:23.770
- It's true.
We got it all.

01:27:23.772 --> 01:27:25.439
Debt paid in full.

01:27:25.441 --> 01:27:27.774
- I'll say when
the debt is paid in full,

01:27:27.776 --> 01:27:29.676
and that's when
Tim puts you down!

01:27:29.678 --> 01:27:32.179
Your time has passed, coach!

01:27:32.181 --> 01:27:34.715
- He's been like a
father to me, Sonny.

01:27:34.717 --> 01:27:36.850
I can't do it.

01:27:36.852 --> 01:27:41.188
- <i>I</i> was like
a father to you. Me!

01:27:41.190 --> 01:27:43.757
10 years!

01:27:45.594 --> 01:27:48.128
You were a mopey little
pissant when I met you.

01:27:48.130 --> 01:27:50.564
I rebuilt you into
the man that you are.

01:27:50.566 --> 01:27:53.100
- Not a man I'm proud of, Sonny.

01:27:53.102 --> 01:27:55.535
- Everybody likes a
good comeback story.

01:27:55.537 --> 01:27:59.106
- Shut the fuck up,
you geriatric fuck up,

01:27:59.108 --> 01:28:02.643
pissing your money away,
money that you never even had!

01:28:02.645 --> 01:28:04.978
You know, you're
a dead man to me already.

01:28:04.980 --> 01:28:07.314
The money is just a bonus.

01:28:07.316 --> 01:28:09.983
- Nobody cares about you, Sonny.

01:28:09.985 --> 01:28:12.953
'Cause you don't
value human life,

01:28:12.955 --> 01:28:16.056
no one values yours.

01:28:16.058 --> 01:28:20.861
- If that's true, he would've
pulled the trigger already.

01:28:23.665 --> 01:28:25.599
- Anybody see the
show <i> my two dads?</i>

01:28:25.601 --> 01:28:27.768
Family programming
at its finest.

01:28:27.770 --> 01:28:30.137
Anyways, Tim can
just have 2 dads!

01:28:30.139 --> 01:28:32.939
I'm sure he cares about
you both immensely.

01:28:32.941 --> 01:28:35.275
Especially you, Sonny.

01:28:35.277 --> 01:28:37.311
- Shut up, hairball!

01:29:07.008 --> 01:29:08.642
- Ha! Classy touch!

01:29:08.644 --> 01:29:10.210
- No more shoe-boxes, Kel.

01:29:10.212 --> 01:29:11.978
- Hey! This
is my show.

01:29:15.017 --> 01:29:17.884
Get in the car! Jesus!

01:29:42.745 --> 01:29:46.580
- No! Matty! Matthew!

01:29:51.085 --> 01:29:52.352
- Two...

01:29:52.354 --> 01:29:56.089
Two bad guys,
two shots. Mark it!

01:29:58.527 --> 01:30:00.060
- You're alive!

01:30:00.062 --> 01:30:03.096
- You never told me
anything about kickback, Tim.

01:30:03.098 --> 01:30:05.599
- I didn't think you'd
have to pull the triggers.

01:30:07.002 --> 01:30:09.236
- Meet me there.

01:30:13.941 --> 01:30:15.976
- Anybody home?

01:30:18.212 --> 01:30:19.946
Tim?

01:30:22.116 --> 01:30:24.451
- I love you.

01:30:24.453 --> 01:30:26.119
- I love you too.

01:30:27.688 --> 01:30:30.857
- Bobby, grab a couple
hockey bags from the garage!

01:30:30.859 --> 01:30:32.492
We're gonna need 'em.

01:31:17.171 --> 01:31:20.240
<i>- Two gangsters well
known to police</i>

01:31:20.242 --> 01:31:21.641
<i>were found dead</i>

01:31:21.643 --> 01:31:24.411
<i>at the Steelhawks championship
reunion hockey game,</i>

01:31:24.413 --> 01:31:27.614
<i>where reports are speculating
a double-cross during a robbery.</i>

01:31:27.616 --> 01:31:30.917
<i>At the game, fans were treated

01:31:30.919 --> 01:31:34.754
<i>of wayward son and junior
hockey great Tim Tucker.</i>

01:31:34.756 --> 01:31:39.426
<i>Perhaps the book has yet to be
closed on this local legend</i>

01:31:39.428 --> 01:31:42.863
<i>and a new beginning is
just around the corner.</i>
