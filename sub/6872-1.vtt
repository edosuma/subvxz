01:00.000 --> 01:01.729
Boys, let's go.

01:02.440 --> 01:04.169
Come on, tighten up.

01:06.120 --> 01:07.929
Single file, gentlemen.

01:08.080 --> 01:09.764
Center of the hall.

01:10.120 --> 01:11.531
- Come on, tighten it up.
- Condition unit one!

01:11.680 --> 01:13.170
Condition unit one, copy that.

01:13.320 --> 01:15.766
On the ground. Show me hands, let's go.

01:15.920 --> 01:17.046
Hands!

01:17.200 --> 01:19.771
Code blue! Fight in progress!

01:42.960 --> 01:45.645
Come on, let's fight, man! Let him go!

01:46.240 --> 01:48.561
At least let me get my shoes.

02:01.680 --> 02:03.170
Mary Anne.

02:03.320 --> 02:04.321
Hello.

02:05.400 --> 02:06.481
Thank you.

02:09.440 --> 02:12.691
Adonis got into a fight today,
and he's in holding.

02:12.840 --> 02:15.730
If you wanna see him,
we're gonna have to go up there.

02:16.280 --> 02:18.328
He's a good kid, he just...

02:18.920 --> 02:20.251
Fights.

02:21.520 --> 02:23.124
All the time.

02:33.440 --> 02:34.680
- Johnson?
- Yeah.

02:34.880 --> 02:36.291
- Right this way.
- Thanks.

02:50.440 --> 02:52.568
Johnson, got a visitor.

02:56.880 --> 02:58.041
Adonis.

03:03.320 --> 03:05.004
Come on in.

03:06.960 --> 03:08.610
I'd like you to meet Mrs...

03:09.840 --> 03:10.841
Uh...

03:11.400 --> 03:13.767
Could we have a moment, please?

03:15.000 --> 03:16.570
Sure.

03:16.720 --> 03:18.643
I'll be right outside.

03:30.040 --> 03:31.769
Why were you fighting?

03:34.040 --> 03:35.929
I'm not going to another group home.

03:37.240 --> 03:39.049
I'm not from a group home.

03:40.400 --> 03:41.731
You a social worker?

03:42.200 --> 03:43.361
No.

03:44.160 --> 03:46.481
I am not a social worker.

03:52.360 --> 03:55.569
Nigga said something
about my ma so I beat his ass.

03:57.640 --> 03:59.927
I'm sorry about your mother.

04:01.400 --> 04:04.563
I know what it's like to lose someone.

04:07.160 --> 04:10.448
When your father died,
I was angry for so long.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.004
I hurt myself, pushed family away.

04:14.160 --> 04:15.730
I don't have no father.

04:16.560 --> 04:17.846
What did you say?

04:18.000 --> 04:20.048
I said I don't have no father.

04:20.200 --> 04:22.089
That's not true.

04:24.920 --> 04:28.208
He passed before you were born,
but you had a father.

04:31.160 --> 04:32.366
You knew him?

04:36.280 --> 04:37.805
He was my husband.

04:39.840 --> 04:44.323
Adonis, I would like it very much
if you would come and stay with me.

04:48.120 --> 04:50.441
Do you think you'd wanna do that?

05:02.680 --> 05:04.682
What was his name?

07:57.280 --> 07:58.327
Hey, James.

07:58.480 --> 08:00.403
Don, sit down.

08:05.240 --> 08:06.924
What you got there?

08:12.600 --> 08:14.284
You're joking, right?

08:14.840 --> 08:16.330
You get a promotion and you're quitting?

08:18.080 --> 08:20.287
Look, this career just ain't for me.

08:20.840 --> 08:22.080
What are you gonna do?

08:25.000 --> 08:27.082
Hey, man, thanks for everything.

08:44.520 --> 08:46.045
Just wanna talk to you about my job.

08:46.720 --> 08:48.768
- You see your new office?
- Hmm.

08:48.960 --> 08:51.122
Yeah. But, um...

08:51.280 --> 08:52.964
Well, what's it like?

08:53.120 --> 08:55.600
This is a big deal, this promotion.

08:56.320 --> 08:58.527
Did they hire your assistant?

09:02.200 --> 09:03.531
Thank you.

09:04.280 --> 09:06.282
Very proud of you.

09:22.640 --> 09:24.847
Superfight Two with Rocky Balboa,
the challenger

09:25.040 --> 09:28.010
and, of course, Apollo Creed,
the world champion.

09:28.160 --> 09:29.446
And there's the bell.

09:29.640 --> 09:30.721
Comes over in a hurry now.

09:30.920 --> 09:32.729
He throws a couple of
rights and lefts out there.

09:32.920 --> 09:34.843
He starts to take command early here

09:35.000 --> 09:38.004
and now he kinda moves his feet
along the side of the ring.

09:38.160 --> 09:39.525
A good right hand thrown at him.

09:39.720 --> 09:42.041
Another right and another right
thrown by the champion.

09:42.200 --> 09:43.531
Creed is going for the knockout.

09:43.680 --> 09:45.921
Just holding that right hand
and he's just waiting for that

09:46.080 --> 09:47.161
precise moment that he wants...

09:47.320 --> 09:50.688
There it is! He unloaded that.
But here comes Balboa!

09:50.840 --> 09:52.683
Got him in that corner,
and there's lefts and rights.

09:52.840 --> 09:54.285
Here comes Balboa coming back out.

09:54.440 --> 09:55.680
A left and a right to the head.

09:55.840 --> 09:57.524
But now it is Creed coming back.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.284
Creed with the left hand.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.364
Balboa appears to be getting hit often.

10:12.200 --> 10:14.680
Take it to him. Take it to the body.

10:14.880 --> 10:16.405
There you go!

10:16.880 --> 10:18.803
Make your time count, baby.

10:19.240 --> 10:22.130
You know what's coming up. There you go.

10:23.120 --> 10:24.565
Check it out.

10:25.600 --> 10:27.204
What you doing here, man?

10:27.360 --> 10:29.488
15 and 0, 15 knockouts.

10:29.760 --> 10:32.969
In Tijuana? No, bro.

10:33.120 --> 10:34.804
That's barroom brawling.

10:34.960 --> 10:36.610
Well, I'm all in anyway.

10:36.760 --> 10:38.888
So I figure we start out local,
just to get our momentum going,

10:39.040 --> 10:40.246
then we can move wherever we wanna move.

10:40.400 --> 10:41.890
- "We"?
- I was figuring...

10:42.040 --> 10:45.442
Adonis, these boys come in here,
this how they survive.

10:45.600 --> 10:47.011
They gotta fight for life.

10:47.160 --> 10:49.640
Kill or be killed. People die in there.

10:49.800 --> 10:52.770
Your daddy died in the ring.
This ain't no joke.

10:52.960 --> 10:54.086
I don't know him.

10:54.240 --> 10:56.083
Ain't got nothing to do with me.

10:56.240 --> 10:58.402
- Okay, you real tough now.
- Yup.

10:58.960 --> 11:01.611
Nah, I ain't training you.

11:01.960 --> 11:03.803
You know I ain't training you.
Nobody training you.

11:03.960 --> 11:05.166
I'm gonna make sure about that.

11:08.240 --> 11:10.368
We making champs in the Delphi Gym!

11:10.560 --> 11:13.689
We not dancing!
We not singing! We fighting!

11:13.840 --> 11:16.366
You struggle every day,
you fight for something.

11:16.520 --> 11:17.681
You damn right!

11:20.120 --> 11:21.281
Hey, listen up!

11:22.360 --> 11:23.600
Adonis.

11:24.760 --> 11:26.489
These the keys to my 'Stang right here.

11:26.640 --> 11:27.801
Adonis, get out the ring!

11:27.960 --> 11:29.530
All you gotta do
is land one clean head shot.

11:29.680 --> 11:30.761
What I gotta put up for it?

11:36.000 --> 11:38.480
Put up your hands. You a pro, right?

11:38.640 --> 11:40.369
No, no, no.

11:40.920 --> 11:42.331
You gonna get the shit knocked out of you.

11:42.480 --> 11:45.731
- You ain't gotta prove nothing to me.
- Better listen to your family, boy.

11:48.680 --> 11:49.806
Oh, my God.

11:49.960 --> 11:51.962
At least put on your head gear.

11:52.440 --> 11:53.566
- No head gear?
- Mmm-hmm.

11:53.720 --> 11:54.721
It's on you.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.411
Killer, right?

11:59.560 --> 12:01.881
He a killer, right, Lil Duke?

12:02.400 --> 12:04.448
Where were you at when
I was in group homes, huh?

12:04.600 --> 12:05.886
You miss a meal?

12:06.040 --> 12:07.121
Nah!

12:07.280 --> 12:08.566
Which one of your killers in here next?

12:08.720 --> 12:10.802
You pick him! You pick who's next!

12:11.000 --> 12:12.331
I'm next.

12:23.840 --> 12:25.729
Hey, I just need one round, bro.

12:25.880 --> 12:27.484
All right, you wanna warm up?

12:27.680 --> 12:29.569
I don't need no warm-up. Get my stuff.

12:32.520 --> 12:35.330
I see you got your head gear on. Good job.

12:40.680 --> 12:41.761
Nah.

12:48.400 --> 12:49.526
Don't run.

13:17.960 --> 13:19.200
Told you I'd win, man.

13:19.560 --> 13:20.891
I told you.

13:21.040 --> 13:22.201
I tried to tell you something, bro.

13:22.400 --> 13:25.324
You don't wanna listen.

13:25.480 --> 13:27.926
You wanna learn things the hard way, huh?

13:40.080 --> 13:41.730
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:41.920 --> 13:43.684
How you doing?

13:43.880 --> 13:45.211
Doing good.

13:45.360 --> 13:48.091
I just came home, I wanted to talk to you.

13:48.240 --> 13:49.321
Yeah?

13:49.560 --> 13:51.608
I quit my job.

13:53.200 --> 13:54.611
Yeah. No...

13:58.840 --> 14:01.605
Where did you get this? Mexico?

14:02.240 --> 14:03.241
It's not that bad.

14:03.440 --> 14:05.283
"It's not that bad."

14:06.760 --> 14:08.603
I ought to knock you out myself.

14:08.920 --> 14:11.241
You know how many times I had to
carry your father up these stairs

14:11.400 --> 14:13.607
- because he couldn't walk?
- Yes.

14:13.760 --> 14:16.206
How many times I had to wipe his ass
because he couldn't use his hands?

14:17.280 --> 14:19.647
Is that what you want? No.

14:19.800 --> 14:22.246
You want brain damage. Yeah, you do.

14:22.400 --> 14:24.448
You want to be so brain-damaged,
you can't form a sentence.

14:24.600 --> 14:25.761
I can get hurt doing anything.

14:25.920 --> 14:27.604
Apollo didn't get hurt, he got killed!

14:27.800 --> 14:28.926
People get killed!

14:29.920 --> 14:32.491
I didn't take you in
for you to go backwards.

14:32.680 --> 14:34.444
You're better than this.

14:34.640 --> 14:35.880
I'm leaving soon.

14:40.680 --> 14:43.445
I'm gonna be fighting full-time now.

14:43.760 --> 14:45.888
So I wanted to tell you face-to-face.

14:48.680 --> 14:52.766
You are your father's son
and you're part of him.

14:54.600 --> 14:57.649
But it doesn't mean you have to be him.

15:00.200 --> 15:01.247
I'm gonna call you.

15:03.840 --> 15:07.287
Listen, you want to be
in somebody's ring...

15:09.840 --> 15:11.524
You don't have to call me.

15:55.440 --> 15:57.488
All right, smile!

16:39.600 --> 16:41.090
How you doing?

16:42.560 --> 16:44.801
This was taken from the 10th round
of the first fight, right?

16:46.200 --> 16:47.611
Good call.

16:48.240 --> 16:49.446
How'd you know that?

16:50.680 --> 16:55.449
I heard about a third fight between
you and Apollo, behind closed doors.

16:55.880 --> 16:57.245
That true?

16:57.720 --> 16:59.131
How'd you hear about that?

16:59.920 --> 17:00.921
Who won?

17:02.920 --> 17:05.526
It's kind of a secret.
What'd you say your name was?

17:06.200 --> 17:07.440
Donnie.

17:07.599 --> 17:09.682
The girl said you wanted
to talk about something.

17:09.960 --> 17:11.484
Yeah, I want to talk to you
about training me.

17:11.800 --> 17:13.801
Training you.

17:14.040 --> 17:16.361
I don't do that stuff no more.
Sorry about that.

17:16.520 --> 17:18.089
Listen, it's getting kind of late, kid.

17:18.240 --> 17:20.446
So I'm gonna close up.

17:20.640 --> 17:21.800
How good was he?

17:22.800 --> 17:25.644
Who? Apollo? Yeah, he was great.

17:25.800 --> 17:28.121
He's a perfect fighter.
Ain't nobody ever better.

17:28.280 --> 17:29.645
So how'd you beat him?

17:29.800 --> 17:30.881
Time beat him.

17:31.040 --> 17:34.442
Time, you know, takes
everybody out, it's undefeated.

17:34.600 --> 17:35.806
Anyway, I gotta lock up.

17:35.960 --> 17:37.769
When Mickey died, he came
and talked to you, right?

17:38.440 --> 17:40.249
Talked you out of quitting?

17:40.400 --> 17:42.641
Took you to L.A., trained you.

17:43.560 --> 17:44.766
Brought you back.

17:50.320 --> 17:52.482
How do you know all this?

17:53.400 --> 17:55.004
How do you think?

17:59.000 --> 18:00.764
What are you, like a cousin?

18:01.840 --> 18:02.921
He's my father.

18:04.520 --> 18:06.807
No, he isn't. I don't believe you.

18:06.960 --> 18:07.961
Call Mary Anne.

18:08.120 --> 18:09.326
Mary Anne. His wife.

18:09.520 --> 18:10.681
The house number still works.

18:12.480 --> 18:14.164
Oh, that's right.

18:14.360 --> 18:16.089
You haven't talked to her
since the funeral.

18:16.280 --> 18:18.521
She said you gave a nice speech, though.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.126
Yeah.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.684
Nice speech.

18:35.680 --> 18:37.728
I want you to train me.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.970
All right? I need somebody solid
and who else better to go to?

18:41.120 --> 18:43.168
You at least owe me that.

18:45.800 --> 18:49.009
I can tell the way you talk,
you been to school.

18:49.160 --> 18:51.731
So I figure you got some brains.

18:51.880 --> 18:54.531
Why would you want
to pick a fighter's life

18:54.680 --> 18:55.806
when you don't have to?

18:55.960 --> 18:58.566
If Apollo was around,
he would tell you that, too.

18:58.720 --> 19:00.006
Well, he ain't around.

19:00.200 --> 19:02.806
I been fighting my whole life.
I ain't got a choice.

19:03.480 --> 19:05.687
It's always about a choice.

19:06.200 --> 19:07.486
I was in the ring.

19:07.640 --> 19:08.801
I saw how it went down.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.411
That fight should've been stopped.

19:10.800 --> 19:12.086
I should have stopped it.

19:12.240 --> 19:13.685
Maybe he wanted to go out like a fighter.

19:15.080 --> 19:16.923
Maybe, you did exactly what he wanted.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.288
I think he'd rather be here,
talking with you.

19:35.520 --> 19:37.727
There is a resemblance.

19:43.080 --> 19:46.607
I'm usually here all the time,

19:46.760 --> 19:49.881
so if you're ever in the neighborhood,
come by, if you need something.

19:50.080 --> 19:51.730
I'll be at Mickey's Gym tomorrow.

19:51.880 --> 19:54.451
I don't go there.
I haven't been there in a long time.

19:57.280 --> 20:01.891
Since we're pretty much like family
who won the third fight?

20:05.280 --> 20:06.884
He did.

20:35.600 --> 20:38.609
In boxing... fighters' origins can endure

20:38.760 --> 20:40.967
as the most sacred element
of their identity,

20:41.480 --> 20:45.690
shaping choices that can
change their lives forever.

20:46.120 --> 20:49.488
"Pretty" Ricky Conlan is a faithful son
of Liverpool, England,

20:49.840 --> 20:53.845
a place where people find hope
in the tales of their heroes.

20:54.840 --> 20:58.287
But for the undefeated best
pound-for-pound boxer in the world,

20:58.480 --> 21:00.721
the future is filled with uncertainty,

21:01.680 --> 21:04.490
with a seven-year prison sentence looming.

21:05.080 --> 21:07.765
I didn't plan on spending me
prime years in a prison cell.

21:08.320 --> 21:10.448
I hate letting me family down.

21:10.600 --> 21:14.127
Now what could be his
final bout awaits him at home,

21:14.280 --> 21:17.966
in one of his city's most
hallowed sporting temples.

21:18.120 --> 21:22.045
Here, he'll welcome an opponent
who's also never been beaten

21:22.200 --> 21:24.806
and who's boxed his way
from California streets

21:24.960 --> 21:27.247
to American stardom.

21:27.400 --> 21:29.801
Fighting out of the famed
Delphi Boxing Academy,

21:30.280 --> 21:33.807
with a trainer whose father
guided icons of the past,

21:35.040 --> 21:36.724
Danny "Stuntman" Wheeler

21:36.880 --> 21:38.484
believes he's the sport's future.

21:39.720 --> 21:41.085
Conlan's going away for a long time.

21:41.240 --> 21:42.401
Now it's my turn.

21:42.560 --> 21:43.721
I've never lost.

21:43.880 --> 21:46.121
I've never even been knocked down,
and that's not gonna change.

21:47.040 --> 21:50.408
A champion in a dark
and extraordinary predicament.

21:51.160 --> 21:54.084
A challenger uninterested
in a hero's send-off.

21:56.520 --> 21:59.569
This is 24/7: Conlan/Wheeler.

22:26.840 --> 22:28.649
Kick this dude ass.

22:35.920 --> 22:37.160
No respect, man.

23:00.280 --> 23:01.725
I'm Donnie.

23:02.400 --> 23:03.811
Yeah?

23:04.480 --> 23:06.130
And I just moved in upstairs.

23:06.320 --> 23:08.129
Okay. What do you want, Donnie? It's late.

23:08.320 --> 23:09.481
I can hear your music.

23:09.640 --> 23:12.086
Yeah? I didn't know it was that loud.

23:12.280 --> 23:13.281
Well, it is, all right?

23:13.440 --> 23:14.566
I gotta wake up early and work out.

23:15.160 --> 23:17.083
Oh. Oh, got you.

23:17.240 --> 23:21.006
You gotta wake up early
and do your, uh, jawns.

23:21.160 --> 23:23.288
Keep your body tight. Cool.

23:23.440 --> 23:24.965
I'll turn my music down.
You won't hear a peep.

23:25.120 --> 23:26.121
Thanks...

24:22.120 --> 24:23.849
Snap it back!

24:31.240 --> 24:33.049
Breathe, Leo, breathe.

24:33.240 --> 24:34.730
Good boy.

24:44.200 --> 24:45.440
Hey.

24:47.080 --> 24:48.081
Can I help you?

24:48.240 --> 24:49.366
Looking to sign up.

24:49.880 --> 24:52.087
- Where you from?
- L.A.

24:52.240 --> 24:53.366
Hollywood!

24:53.520 --> 24:55.090
Which gym? I know all those guys.

24:55.240 --> 24:57.846
Don't have one. I'm more self-taught.

24:58.920 --> 25:00.251
Self-taught?

25:00.920 --> 25:02.922
You know Balboa?

25:03.080 --> 25:04.206
Yes, we grew up together.

25:05.480 --> 25:07.050
Most members just work themselves out.

25:07.200 --> 25:08.804
For an extra $20 a month,

25:08.960 --> 25:12.123
I can give you drills,
check in on you when I can.

25:12.320 --> 25:13.810
Yeah, that works.

25:21.440 --> 25:22.680
Double jab.

25:24.080 --> 25:25.923
Move your head, babe.

26:44.760 --> 26:47.604
Boxing fans have been waiting years

26:47.760 --> 26:48.966
for the Superfight between
"Pretty" Ricky Conlan

26:49.120 --> 26:50.360
and Danny Wheeler.

26:50.520 --> 26:53.490
But we guess the fighters
couldn't wait another 24 hours.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.445
Conlan punched Wheeler

26:55.600 --> 26:57.648
after words were exchanged
during the face-off.

26:58.200 --> 27:02.042
Wheeler suffered a broken jaw
and has already announced plans

27:02.200 --> 27:05.010
to sue Conlan and the WBC.

27:12.400 --> 27:13.401
Hey, Unc!

27:14.560 --> 27:15.721
Unc!

27:16.520 --> 27:18.010
How you doing?

27:18.560 --> 27:20.050
Did you call me "Unc"?

27:20.240 --> 27:22.402
Yeah, it was either that or O.G.

27:22.720 --> 27:24.370
What's an "O.G."?

27:24.520 --> 27:26.363
Old-ass gangster.

27:26.800 --> 27:28.245
"Unc" is good.

27:28.400 --> 27:29.731
I can do that.

27:29.880 --> 27:31.484
It's all good.

27:31.920 --> 27:33.809
So why'd you come by? You hungry?

27:34.000 --> 27:35.729
No, I just wrapped up at the gym.

27:35.920 --> 27:37.081
Figured I'd stop by.

27:37.240 --> 27:38.241
Okay.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.206
Maybe ask you a question.

27:41.360 --> 27:43.761
Sure. I can do all this.

27:45.280 --> 27:46.281
Uh...

27:46.720 --> 27:49.166
What are some drills I can do
to get my hand speed up?

27:49.320 --> 27:51.084
Some guys up there,
I bet they can help you.

27:51.240 --> 27:52.571
There's a guy there named Pete.

27:52.720 --> 27:54.245
He's a pretty good trainer.

27:54.440 --> 27:57.171
Yeah, but he's with
his fighter most of the time.

27:57.360 --> 27:59.442
I mostly just train myself.

28:01.600 --> 28:03.090
They know you're a Creed?

28:03.800 --> 28:04.881
I don't go by that.

28:05.040 --> 28:07.122
I'm trying to make it on my own.

28:07.280 --> 28:08.406
Name's Johnson.

28:08.560 --> 28:10.244
- Who's Johnson?
- Mom's name.

28:10.800 --> 28:13.280
Plus, just makes life easier.

28:14.480 --> 28:15.481
Uh-huh.

28:19.480 --> 28:22.245
Plus, you know, if you train me
ain't nobody around here knows me.

28:22.400 --> 28:23.526
We could fly under the radar.

28:25.400 --> 28:26.970
- They'd never know.
- Yeah.

28:27.920 --> 28:31.647
I told you before,
I just don't wanna do it, kid.

28:33.720 --> 28:38.123
That's cool, but maybe you
could just give me some drills.

28:38.920 --> 28:41.127
- Drills?
- Yeah, things I could do on my own.

28:42.640 --> 28:45.928
You don't stop, do you?
You're like a woodpecker.

28:46.280 --> 28:47.770
My God.

28:54.760 --> 28:57.491
All right. I got a few.

28:57.640 --> 28:59.483
But that's it. Okay?

28:59.640 --> 29:00.641
Of course.

29:01.000 --> 29:04.766
Five rounds of jumping rope.

29:04.920 --> 29:09.244
Three rounds on each of the bags...

29:09.400 --> 29:12.131
When you get to the heavy bag,
just don't keep throwing your hands

29:12.280 --> 29:13.770
because you can hurt them.

29:13.920 --> 29:16.605
It's also about using
your legs, all right?

29:16.760 --> 29:20.810
And then five rounds of...

29:21.760 --> 29:23.171
Shadow...

29:23.360 --> 29:24.361
O-W.

29:24.600 --> 29:26.523
- There's a "W." Boxing.
- Boxing, yeah.

29:26.680 --> 29:28.523
And that's it.

29:29.360 --> 29:30.930
- All right?
- Yeah.

29:31.320 --> 29:32.810
Okay, here you go.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.001
Oh, that is perfect.

29:34.160 --> 29:35.764
Good luck with that.

29:38.280 --> 29:40.601
All right, got it. Hold that real quick.

29:49.800 --> 29:51.211
All right, man.

29:51.360 --> 29:53.124
Wait, don't you want this?

29:53.280 --> 29:54.361
I got it right here.

29:54.560 --> 29:56.289
What if you lose that thing or it breaks?

29:56.480 --> 29:58.562
It's already up in the cloud.

30:02.400 --> 30:04.846
What cloud? What cloud?

30:07.320 --> 30:08.890
Hey, Ma, it's me.

30:09.040 --> 30:13.724
I was just calling to let you know
I'm doing good and I got an apartment.

30:13.880 --> 30:16.360
It ain't much but I'm trying
to make it into something.

30:17.040 --> 30:18.405
I miss you.

30:18.720 --> 30:22.886
I wanna hear from you, so call me back
when you get a chance. All right.

30:43.600 --> 30:44.761
What, it's too loud?

30:44.920 --> 30:48.447
No, I just heard you down here working.

30:48.600 --> 30:50.682
Figured you'd wanna take a break.

30:51.280 --> 30:52.566
Maybe get some food?

30:52.720 --> 30:53.846
Where you from, Donnie?

30:54.000 --> 30:55.286
I'm from L.A.

30:55.440 --> 30:57.761
So is this how y'all
ask females out in L.A.?

30:58.440 --> 31:00.090
Just wanted to know if you were hungry.

31:00.240 --> 31:01.287
Not a date.

31:01.440 --> 31:02.441
Right.

31:04.520 --> 31:07.091
You know what? It's all good.

31:07.520 --> 31:08.965
It's okay.

31:09.400 --> 31:10.811
Hey, yo.

31:11.280 --> 31:12.964
I am hungry.

31:18.920 --> 31:21.446
I only have an hour.
Do you know where you wanna go?

31:21.720 --> 31:23.484
I was hoping you could tell me.

31:23.640 --> 31:24.880
You're from Philly, right?

31:28.480 --> 31:29.970
Okay.

31:34.920 --> 31:36.570
Good luck, man.

31:50.280 --> 31:51.327
So where are we?

31:51.480 --> 31:52.845
North Philly.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.161
So this is Max's.

31:54.320 --> 31:56.800
Hey, superstar! What's going on?

31:56.960 --> 31:58.325
I'm well, thanks. How you doing?

31:58.520 --> 31:59.931
You looking wonderful as always.

32:00.080 --> 32:01.320
Thank you.

32:01.520 --> 32:02.806
How you doing there, my friend?

32:02.960 --> 32:05.088
This my neighbor and
he's a West Coast boy.

32:05.240 --> 32:06.366
Ain't never had a steak before.

32:06.520 --> 32:08.363
Listen, I'm gonna treat him
like he was my neighbor.

32:08.520 --> 32:10.090
That's how good we gonna take care of you.

32:10.280 --> 32:11.645
- You like pickles?
- Nah.

32:11.800 --> 32:12.847
Okay, mayonnaise.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.321
Put extra peppers
on that jawn, both kinds.

32:15.480 --> 32:17.323
Ketchup, extra cheese.

32:17.480 --> 32:19.482
- How much I owe you?
- $9.95.

32:19.640 --> 32:21.051
No, let me get these.

32:21.200 --> 32:23.202
That's cool. I asked you out, right?

32:23.360 --> 32:25.522
You said it wasn't a date, though.

32:25.680 --> 32:27.125
It's not.

32:28.040 --> 32:29.121
Where we eating at?

32:29.280 --> 32:30.406
Right there.

32:30.640 --> 32:32.768
So I heard you back there,
"jawn" this, "jawn" that.

32:32.920 --> 32:33.921
What's a "jawn"?

32:34.120 --> 32:35.531
It's a noun.

32:35.720 --> 32:38.121
See, these is jawns.

32:38.720 --> 32:40.290
This is a jawn.

32:40.440 --> 32:42.363
This restaurant we're sitting
in is a jawn. You're a jawn.

32:42.640 --> 32:44.130
You got a jawn?

32:44.440 --> 32:45.441
Like, a dude?

32:45.640 --> 32:46.801
No.

32:47.560 --> 32:49.483
I got too much going on right now.

32:49.640 --> 32:50.801
Shows and stuff?

32:50.960 --> 32:52.246
Yeah.

32:52.400 --> 32:54.402
I'm opening at
Electric Factory next month.

32:54.560 --> 32:55.561
What's that?

32:55.720 --> 32:57.006
It's a big venue out here.

32:57.200 --> 32:58.565
A lot of people got their start.

32:58.720 --> 33:00.404
Jill, Legend, the Roots.

33:01.480 --> 33:02.845
That's wassup.

33:05.920 --> 33:08.491
- Can I ask you something personal?
- Mmm-hmm.

33:13.080 --> 33:15.082
I got progressive hearing loss.

33:16.560 --> 33:18.324
Just started wearing these this past year.

33:18.480 --> 33:21.086
But I only need them in places
with a lot of background noise.

33:21.240 --> 33:22.241
For now.

33:23.320 --> 33:25.926
So it's progressive, so eventually...

33:26.080 --> 33:27.605
Yeah.

33:28.920 --> 33:30.524
Yeah.

33:30.680 --> 33:32.170
I'm just getting ready for it.

33:32.360 --> 33:35.011
Like I'm getting used to these,
I'm learning sign language and stuff.

33:37.920 --> 33:40.844
But I really can only remember bad words.

33:41.120 --> 33:43.202
Ones that aren't that useful like...

33:45.760 --> 33:47.967
The fuck's that?

33:48.120 --> 33:51.681
You can't tell?
This is the bull, the horns, this is...

33:52.280 --> 33:54.601
Yeah, this is bullshit.

33:54.800 --> 33:56.609
- That's your favorite?
- Uh-huh.

33:57.720 --> 34:00.121
You don't really seem like a boxer to me.

34:00.280 --> 34:01.611
I mean, you're in shape and all but...

34:02.640 --> 34:04.642
I don't know. Aren't most boxers like...

34:04.800 --> 34:06.564
- Like what?
- Like street.

34:06.720 --> 34:08.643
I'm not saying you're
a square or anything,

34:08.800 --> 34:10.802
but I'm just curious,
what made you wanna fight?

34:11.480 --> 34:12.719
My pop was a fighter.

34:12.880 --> 34:14.803
Oh, right. That makes sense.

34:14.960 --> 34:16.085
Did he fight pro?

34:17.040 --> 34:18.280
Something like that.

34:19.239 --> 34:21.129
Does he train you?

34:21.440 --> 34:23.123
My pop died before I was born.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.809
I'm sorry to hear that.

34:31.440 --> 34:33.010
So what made you wanna sing?

34:39.719 --> 34:40.721
Uh...

34:41.000 --> 34:43.002
It makes me feel alive.

34:46.800 --> 34:47.926
Where's your next show?

34:48.639 --> 34:51.688
That place that you saw me at,
Johnny Brenda's.

34:51.840 --> 34:55.925
I got a residency there
so we're back on Friday.

34:58.920 --> 35:00.809
Can I roll with you?

35:01.360 --> 35:04.011
I wanna show up, you know. Show some love.

35:07.680 --> 35:09.045
Let me think on it.

35:31.800 --> 35:33.689
Okay.

35:33.840 --> 35:36.047
Here we go, Paulie.

35:37.520 --> 35:39.887
Happy birthday, my friend.

35:41.680 --> 35:43.569
I didn't forget ya.

35:44.560 --> 35:46.164
Your favorite.

35:46.960 --> 35:48.803
Miss ya, pal.

35:49.840 --> 35:52.491
Yo, Adrian, my darling.

35:54.400 --> 35:56.368
The best of the best.

35:58.400 --> 36:00.641
I'll tell you, Adrian, God.

36:01.920 --> 36:05.402
It's getting harder to walk up this hill.
What does that mean?

36:06.320 --> 36:08.322
Anyway, it's a good day today.

36:08.520 --> 36:10.727
It's a good day, got no problems.

36:10.880 --> 36:12.325
Bills are paid.

36:12.520 --> 36:16.887
Only thing is, it's tough to sleep
at night sometimes. My back.

36:17.040 --> 36:19.850
No matter what you do,
it catches up to you.

36:20.600 --> 36:25.128
Anyway, shall we see
what's new in the world today?

37:05.200 --> 37:06.281
Whoa.

37:06.680 --> 37:07.681
Hey, Rocky!

37:07.840 --> 37:08.841
Hey, how you doing?

37:09.120 --> 37:10.770
- Good to see you.
- How you doing?

37:10.960 --> 37:12.724
Hey, Rock! Long time no see, brother.

37:12.880 --> 37:14.484
- Still here? Good to see you.
- Yeah.

37:14.640 --> 37:17.007
- Hey, the Italian Stallion's back.
- How you doing?

37:17.160 --> 37:18.764
- It's like a party here with everyone.
- Yeah, right.

37:18.960 --> 37:21.042
- Welcome back, man. It's been a while.
- Yeah, thank you very much.

37:21.240 --> 37:22.241
- How do you feel?
- Good.

37:22.440 --> 37:23.965
- What, are you making a comeback?
- No.

37:24.240 --> 37:25.969
- Hey, champ.
- Hey, Pete. What's up?

37:26.120 --> 37:28.202
- Didn't know you were coming by.
- I didn't either.

37:28.360 --> 37:30.362
I was just in the neighborhood.
You've done nice here.

37:30.560 --> 37:32.528
Place is looking good,
new paint and everything.

37:32.680 --> 37:33.966
- Very good, very nice.
- I do what I can.

37:34.120 --> 37:35.565
- Remember my son, Leo?
- Of course I do.

37:35.720 --> 37:37.006
A lot bigger since you last seen him.

37:37.160 --> 37:40.770
- Yeah, very big.
- Rocky, he's 17 and 0.

37:40.920 --> 37:42.729
Things are really opening up for us.

37:42.880 --> 37:45.042
Leo! Come.

37:45.400 --> 37:49.769
Rocky, option's still open
if you wanna get involved.

37:49.920 --> 37:51.729
Little training, little motivation.

37:51.880 --> 37:53.291
Let me think about it.

37:53.440 --> 37:55.408
- Sure, sure.
- How you doing, kid?

37:55.560 --> 37:56.607
It's an honor to meet you, champ.

37:56.760 --> 37:58.489
Nice to meet you, too.
17 and 0, very good.

37:58.640 --> 38:00.563
Yeah, I was supposed to fight
on the Ricky Conlan's card...

38:00.720 --> 38:02.643
- Hey, Unc!
- But it got canceled.

38:04.840 --> 38:05.841
Unc.

38:06.040 --> 38:07.849
- He talking to you?
- Yeah, I think so. Yeah.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.286
- You made it.
- Yeah.

38:09.440 --> 38:11.408
Just walked by. Here I am.

38:12.480 --> 38:13.811
How you know Hollywood?

38:13.960 --> 38:16.247
Uh, we met at the restaurant.

38:16.840 --> 38:18.171
That's it.

38:21.280 --> 38:23.726
Okay, Rock. Okay.

38:23.880 --> 38:26.451
You need anything, you let me know.

38:26.600 --> 38:28.364
Okay. Good luck, kid. Seriously.

38:28.520 --> 38:29.521
Thanks.

38:29.760 --> 38:33.446
17 and 0. Kid's got a future. Tough.

38:33.840 --> 38:35.524
Can I talk to you a minute?

38:42.160 --> 38:46.085
I don't really know what I'm doing here
because I got other plans for my life

38:46.240 --> 38:47.730
and this wasn't part of it.

38:47.880 --> 38:49.405
Your father was special.

38:49.880 --> 38:52.042
Tell you the truth,
I don't know if you're special.

38:52.200 --> 38:54.487
Only you gonna know that
when the time is right.

38:54.680 --> 38:56.170
It ain't gonna come overnight.

38:56.320 --> 38:57.810
You're gonna take a beating,
you're gonna take this,

38:57.960 --> 38:59.769
you're gonna get knocked down,
you're gonna get up

38:59.920 --> 39:01.922
and you're gonna see
if you got the right thing.

39:02.080 --> 39:04.890
But, you gotta work hard.

39:05.040 --> 39:07.327
I swear to God, if you're not gonna do it,

39:07.480 --> 39:08.641
I'm out.

39:10.040 --> 39:12.611
Rock, every punch I've ever
thrown has been on my own.

39:12.760 --> 39:15.127
Nobody showed me how to do this.

39:16.280 --> 39:17.930
I'm ready.

39:20.360 --> 39:22.283
Come on. Let's do this.

39:23.080 --> 39:25.162
Step into my office.

39:25.600 --> 39:26.601
You serious?

39:26.800 --> 39:28.484
I am serious. This is old school.

39:28.800 --> 39:30.245
You should be able to grab
one of these birds.

39:30.400 --> 39:31.401
30 seconds?

39:31.760 --> 39:33.364
Yeah, in your dreams.

39:35.280 --> 39:36.930
Come on! You call that fast?

39:44.920 --> 39:47.002
No! Again.

39:47.560 --> 39:48.641
I thought you were fast.

39:49.280 --> 39:50.691
Come here!

39:51.040 --> 39:52.849
Get them legs moving!

39:53.080 --> 39:55.287
Little harder, little faster!

39:55.680 --> 39:58.650
Keep up the pace! Keep going!

40:08.000 --> 40:11.129
Control your tempo then build slowly.

40:12.360 --> 40:13.361
More.

40:13.640 --> 40:15.529
Build, build, build.

40:15.720 --> 40:16.721
Go!

40:29.920 --> 40:31.684
That bell don't mean school's out, Donnie.

40:31.840 --> 40:32.921
Keep going.

40:33.840 --> 40:35.604
That bell means hell.

40:36.440 --> 40:38.681
Just go get the chicken.
It's not that big a deal.

40:38.840 --> 40:39.966
Come here! God damn it!

40:41.520 --> 40:43.010
Oh, my God!

40:44.000 --> 40:46.571
That's pretty good.
Chickens are slowing down.

40:48.520 --> 40:50.568
All right. Donnie, get into your stance.

40:51.280 --> 40:54.204
Make a small target, turn sideways. Okay.

40:54.800 --> 40:56.882
You see this guy here staring back at you?

40:57.040 --> 40:58.041
Yeah.

40:58.200 --> 40:59.770
That's your toughest opponent.

40:59.920 --> 41:03.481
Every time you get into the ring,
that's who you're going against.

41:03.640 --> 41:07.850
I believe that in boxing
and I do believe that in life, okay?

41:08.240 --> 41:09.924
Now throw a jab in the jaw.

41:10.280 --> 41:11.611
All right, one to the gut.

41:12.080 --> 41:14.606
Now, every time you punch this guy,
what's he doing?

41:14.760 --> 41:16.091
- He's throwing one back at me.
- That's right.

41:16.280 --> 41:19.841
So either you block it, slip it
or get out of the way. Go.

41:24.360 --> 41:26.931
I'll leave you two alone for a while.

41:28.440 --> 41:29.771
Good luck.

41:39.320 --> 41:40.321
- Hey.
- Yo.

41:40.560 --> 41:42.722
What's up? Is it cool?

41:43.440 --> 41:44.487
Yes.

41:44.680 --> 41:46.330
Smells good in here.

41:48.200 --> 41:50.328
I don't even know what fighters drink.

41:50.480 --> 41:52.005
Do you drink tea?

41:52.160 --> 41:54.003
Yeah, tea's good. Thank you.

41:54.160 --> 41:55.241
Yeah.

41:56.320 --> 41:57.970
So this is the house.

41:58.280 --> 41:59.566
This is it.

42:01.440 --> 42:02.646
What you working on?

42:02.960 --> 42:04.007
Uh...

42:10.040 --> 42:11.041
Uh, uh, uh...

42:29.840 --> 42:31.001
- Where the beat go?
- Sorry.

42:36.800 --> 42:38.529
Hey, check you out.

42:42.840 --> 42:43.841
Whoo.

42:44.400 --> 42:45.845
Yeah!

43:18.600 --> 43:19.840
One, two, three.

43:20.080 --> 43:23.163
I like that. Very good.

43:26.360 --> 43:28.886
Keep that balance going. Way to go.

43:29.080 --> 43:31.845
Donnie, get up. You gotta keep moving.

43:33.360 --> 43:35.362
It's tough but you gotta do it.

43:35.520 --> 43:36.851
You get a "B" in tough.

43:37.000 --> 43:38.729
Kid's looking good, champ!

43:39.840 --> 43:41.729
Yeah, he's getting there.

43:42.880 --> 43:46.009
Hey, Hollywood,
what do you weigh right now?

43:46.720 --> 43:49.291
I don't know, probably like 180.

43:50.360 --> 43:51.441
Why?

43:56.120 --> 43:59.410
Get down to a buck 75, we'll make
something happen, if you're interested.

43:59.560 --> 44:00.641
- Hell, yeah, I'm interested.
- No.

44:00.800 --> 44:02.962
I do the talking, okay?
You do the fighting.

44:04.040 --> 44:07.487
175? That's your boy's weight.
How you doing, Leo?

44:07.640 --> 44:09.210
- What's up, Rock?
- Yeah.

44:09.360 --> 44:10.805
He could use a fight to keep warm.

44:11.000 --> 44:12.445
- Warm?
- I'm not gonna lie to you.

44:12.600 --> 44:14.887
People will come out to see you
in the corner again, champ.

44:15.040 --> 44:17.930
We'll make it like the old days.
Get the whole city there.

44:18.080 --> 44:20.811
- Make a few bucks for everybody.
- No, I understand that.

44:20.960 --> 44:23.008
But I'm just getting
used to this kid right now,

44:23.160 --> 44:26.970
and, you know, he's getting better
every day but he's gonna take a while.

44:27.120 --> 44:28.167
He's hungry.

44:28.320 --> 44:30.368
You gotta feed him every now and again.
You know that.

44:31.680 --> 44:34.160
Thanks. I appreciate it, chef.
We'll be okay. Thanks.

44:34.320 --> 44:36.368
- Think about it.
- I'll think about it.

44:37.680 --> 44:39.489
Rock, what we training for?

44:39.640 --> 44:40.801
Yeah, what are we training for?

44:40.960 --> 44:43.531
We're training to win, not get killed.
You're not ready yet.

44:43.680 --> 44:45.409
I can lose five pounds.
I can lose five pounds like that.

44:45.560 --> 44:46.891
It's nothing, it's easy.

44:47.320 --> 44:48.731
Hit the bag.

44:51.000 --> 44:52.161
Come on.

44:53.440 --> 44:55.488
This kid's like
a tough Philadelphia fighter.

44:55.640 --> 44:57.483
I ain't never even seen you battle before.

44:57.640 --> 45:00.530
Yeah, but I've been watching him,
and I'm pretty sure he'd catch my fade.

45:00.680 --> 45:02.648
- What's a fade?
- I could take him out.

45:02.840 --> 45:04.888
- Oh, okay.
- All right, listen.

45:05.040 --> 45:07.327
Let me make you an offer you can't refuse.

45:07.480 --> 45:08.527
Are you crazy?

45:08.720 --> 45:10.245
No, I'm serious, man.
Look, we take the match.

45:10.640 --> 45:12.688
- Right.
- I got six weeks to get in shape.

45:12.840 --> 45:15.286
Six weeks, I'll do whatever it takes.
At the end of the six weeks,

45:15.480 --> 45:17.642
- you don't think it's right, call it off.
- Really?

45:17.800 --> 45:19.564
Look, this is what
I'm here for, all right?

45:19.720 --> 45:21.404
I'll go 24-7 with this shit.

45:21.800 --> 45:23.962
Matter of fact, we can go
get my stuff right now.

45:24.120 --> 45:26.043
- For what?
- So I can move into your spot.

45:26.560 --> 45:28.562
Start training camp. Old school, remember?

45:28.720 --> 45:30.404
No, no one's been in my house
in a long time

45:30.560 --> 45:32.164
and I don't think
you'd be comfortable there.

45:32.400 --> 45:33.811
What, you walk around naked?

45:34.360 --> 45:35.486
No.

45:35.640 --> 45:36.926
We're good then.

45:49.680 --> 45:52.365
You better not walk around naked either.

45:52.560 --> 45:54.005
That's for sure.

46:04.360 --> 46:06.010
- Last one?
- Yeah, that's all of it.

46:06.200 --> 46:07.201
Hey!

46:07.680 --> 46:08.681
Hey!

46:08.920 --> 46:10.206
You're moving?

46:10.360 --> 46:11.850
Yeah, today's been crazy.

46:12.000 --> 46:13.843
I didn't get a chance to tell you,

46:14.040 --> 46:16.721
but I'm gonna be living with my uncle
for a while, training for the next fight.

46:16.960 --> 46:17.961
That's your uncle?

46:18.240 --> 46:19.241
He's white.

46:20.200 --> 46:21.531
Yeah, a long time.

46:22.440 --> 46:25.284
He's gonna be staying with me,
and when we ain't training

46:25.440 --> 46:27.204
you're welcome to come on over.

46:27.480 --> 46:29.767
Cool, thank you. It's nice to meet you.

46:34.640 --> 46:35.880
Why you giving me that look?

46:36.040 --> 46:38.646
When were you gonna tell me
that your uncle's Rocky Balboa?

46:40.400 --> 46:41.561
I'm gonna call you.

46:41.720 --> 46:43.722
All right, I'm not gonna hold my breath.

46:51.240 --> 46:52.924
That Bianca girl looks kind of nice.

46:53.120 --> 46:54.167
You like her?

46:54.320 --> 46:55.731
Yeah, she cool. What, this one?

46:55.880 --> 46:57.006
Yeah.

46:57.160 --> 46:59.242
Women weaken legs. You know what I mean?

46:59.400 --> 47:01.482
My legs work just fine.
Whose room was this?

47:01.880 --> 47:03.530
- This is Paulie's room.
- Paulie.

47:03.720 --> 47:06.200
Paulie was my best friend even
though he wasn't so friendly.

47:06.560 --> 47:08.562
What happened to him?

47:08.760 --> 47:10.569
- Passed away.
- I'm sorry.

47:10.760 --> 47:12.125
Kind of a mess.
We'll straighten it up later.

47:12.280 --> 47:14.089
It'll be comfortable.

47:14.600 --> 47:18.082
Oh, man, this is a dope pic!
That's your boy?

47:18.360 --> 47:20.328
Yeah, that's my kid, Robert.

47:24.080 --> 47:25.605
Did you train him, too?

47:25.760 --> 47:29.560
I tried, but he just didn't like fighting,
didn't take to it.

47:31.960 --> 47:32.961
He still around here?

47:33.640 --> 47:36.928
No, he moved to a place called Vancouver
with his girlfriend.

47:37.120 --> 47:39.771
And I think they're having
a great old time up there

47:39.960 --> 47:42.008
and, you know, I hear
from him now and then,

47:42.160 --> 47:45.209
but it was tough for him
to live in Philadelphia.

47:45.360 --> 47:48.330
Me and all that stuff...
You know, Rocky's son.

47:49.280 --> 47:51.931
He's happy. I'm happy for him.

47:57.200 --> 47:59.009
Why don't you unpack, all right?

47:59.160 --> 48:00.685
Make yourself comfortable.

48:00.840 --> 48:03.730
And I'm gonna go to the restaurant
and I'll be back.

48:04.200 --> 48:06.202
Then we start first thing
in the morning, all right?

48:06.400 --> 48:07.640
You got it.

48:25.160 --> 48:26.685
All right, Paulie!

48:28.920 --> 48:29.921
Ooh.

48:55.720 --> 48:58.485
Hey, it's time to train.
This is how you start.

48:58.840 --> 49:01.047
Get your engine going.

49:09.680 --> 49:12.968
I'm gonna take you to this place called
the Front Street Gym up in North Philly.

49:13.120 --> 49:14.406
- It's pretty good.
- Okay.

49:14.560 --> 49:17.206
You're gonna train there, because I don't
want you to train in the same place

49:17.360 --> 49:19.601
as the guy that you're
gonna be fighting, right?

49:19.760 --> 49:20.807
Yeah, that makes sense.

49:20.960 --> 49:23.361
Don, don't get in.
I want you to run alongside.

49:23.560 --> 49:25.050
- I'm kinda antique, right?
- Yeah.

49:25.200 --> 49:27.487
So I'll drive and you try to keep up.

49:27.640 --> 49:28.766
How close is it?

49:28.920 --> 49:30.410
It's close enough.

49:31.280 --> 49:32.327
All right.

49:35.720 --> 49:37.882
Hey, wait! Let me warm up real quick.

49:56.480 --> 49:59.131
You made it. Hey.

49:59.280 --> 50:00.770
I thought you said it was close.

50:00.920 --> 50:02.251
Not that close.

50:02.400 --> 50:04.926
This is Frankford. Tough place.

50:06.600 --> 50:09.809
You wanna be a Philly fighter,
this is the place to go.

50:09.960 --> 50:14.321
Philly fighters, you know, I think
they're the toughest guys in the world.

50:14.680 --> 50:15.681
In a lot of ways.

50:15.880 --> 50:19.441
Maybe it's in the water, I don't know,
but great place though.

50:19.760 --> 50:20.921
What's up with all these bikes?

50:21.120 --> 50:22.281
It's a Philly thing.

50:22.440 --> 50:23.965
These guys are popping
wheelies and making noise,

50:24.160 --> 50:25.525
going up and down the street.

50:25.680 --> 50:26.806
Do you ride?

50:27.000 --> 50:31.005
No. I had a Harley once but I fell off,
so I decided to use my feet.

50:31.600 --> 50:34.001
Now, this kid, Sporino,
he got something special.

50:34.160 --> 50:37.448
He's no pushover, so you're gonna
have to work, you know what I mean?

50:38.520 --> 50:40.045
What do you think?

50:40.800 --> 50:41.881
Not bad, huh?

50:42.040 --> 50:43.201
Not bad at all.

50:43.360 --> 50:47.888
Yeah. This'll get the job done.
Really will.

50:48.280 --> 50:49.281
Uh...

50:49.720 --> 50:51.051
Look at these guys!

50:51.200 --> 50:53.851
Hey! The gang's all here!

50:54.000 --> 50:56.970
Donnie, look at this.

50:57.120 --> 50:58.963
This is a crew if I ever saw one.

50:59.160 --> 51:00.400
Hey, Padman. Good to see you.

51:00.560 --> 51:01.800
Hey, champ. How you doing, bro?

51:01.960 --> 51:04.645
This guy is so good with the mitts,
he's gonna teach you a lot of stuff.

51:04.800 --> 51:08.202
He's got a lot of knowledge.
And Stitch, best cut man in Philadelphia.

51:08.360 --> 51:09.407
Hope we don't need him.

51:09.560 --> 51:10.800
- What's going on?
- Welcome to Philly, brother.

51:11.000 --> 51:12.001
- Pleasure.
- Glad to work with you.

51:12.160 --> 51:13.321
And over here is Elvis Grant.

51:13.480 --> 51:15.528
- He makes the best gloves in the world.
- Uh-huh.

51:15.680 --> 51:18.206
And as my present to you,
starting out on the right foot...

51:18.400 --> 51:19.447
- Nice to meet you, man.
- Nice to meet you too.

51:19.720 --> 51:22.650
He's gonna make you a pair of gloves so
that your hands don't get so bad as me.

51:22.880 --> 51:24.086
What? Is that coffee I smell in there?

51:24.240 --> 51:25.366
Yeah, that's coffee.

51:25.560 --> 51:26.925
All right, you guys
get to know each other.

51:27.080 --> 51:28.161
- Amir.
- All right, Unc.

51:28.320 --> 51:29.731
- Come here.
- Man, I could use some coffee.

51:29.880 --> 51:32.008
Let me introduce you to my son.
This is my son, Amir.

51:32.160 --> 51:33.161
That's the one you're
gonna be sparring with.

51:33.400 --> 51:34.811
- Amir.
- Donnie. Nice to meet you.

51:41.040 --> 51:42.087
Mmm-hmm.

51:43.000 --> 51:44.206
Right hand fast.

51:44.360 --> 51:46.044
Let it go, let it go.

51:47.520 --> 51:49.409
Push off that back foot.

51:50.080 --> 51:51.241
Come on, Donnie, a little quicker.

51:51.400 --> 51:52.526
Come on, Donnie. Back it up.

51:52.680 --> 51:54.444
No, just like he's doing. Yeah.

51:54.600 --> 51:56.443
- I can't pivot fast enough.
- Yeah, just turn it.

51:56.600 --> 51:57.806
That's your power.

51:58.680 --> 51:59.886
Fast, pop it fast.

52:00.040 --> 52:01.041
I'm popping as fast as I can.

52:01.200 --> 52:02.645
I'm trying to push off my
back foot like you told me.

52:02.800 --> 52:04.802
Hey, Donnie. Come here.

52:06.400 --> 52:07.765
I came out here to work with you, though.

52:08.000 --> 52:09.206
This is how I work, okay?

52:09.560 --> 52:12.609
There's some things I can't do.
I can't do this anymore.

52:12.760 --> 52:14.250
I can never hold the pads like that.

52:14.440 --> 52:16.408
But I'm looking at you.
I'm working with you.

52:16.560 --> 52:17.846
I'm working with this.

52:18.280 --> 52:21.040
- Lighten it up.
- Am I still taking them real shots?

52:22.120 --> 52:23.565
Slow it down. Hey, hey!

52:24.040 --> 52:25.963
That's it. Hey, hey, hey!

52:26.480 --> 52:27.970
This easy work, Pop.

52:29.440 --> 52:32.046
Gotta keep moving. That's it.

52:32.760 --> 52:34.922
- Time! Bell! Bell.
- Huh!

52:35.080 --> 52:36.081
Taking real shots though!

52:36.240 --> 52:38.129
- What you mean?
- Cut it out!

52:38.280 --> 52:39.406
Take those gloves off right now!

52:39.560 --> 52:40.561
- This my gym!
- Take the glove off right now!

52:40.760 --> 52:41.921
Take your soft ass back to L.A.!

52:42.080 --> 52:44.287
You ain't ready yet! This my gym!

52:44.440 --> 52:46.442
Fuck this gym!

52:46.640 --> 52:48.244
- Called a learning curve...
- Ain't no learning.

52:48.400 --> 52:50.402
Hey, hey, hey! You know what?

52:50.600 --> 52:52.125
You can't learn anything
when you're talking.

52:52.280 --> 52:53.281
That's a fact of life.

52:53.480 --> 52:55.403
As long as you're talking,
you're not listening.

52:55.600 --> 52:59.161
Go apologize. You guys are
on the same damn team, okay?

52:59.920 --> 53:02.685
- There you go. Good.
- You good. It's okay.

53:02.840 --> 53:05.081
All right. Now let's go to work!

53:05.440 --> 53:07.010
Double jab. Yup.

53:07.320 --> 53:08.765
Go ahead over the top.

53:08.920 --> 53:10.649
Right hook here. Over here.

53:12.680 --> 53:16.291
One step at a time, one punch
at a time, one round at a time.

53:16.440 --> 53:20.010
One step at a time, one punch at a time,
one round at a time. Turn right.

53:22.520 --> 53:24.124
Come on, let's go.

53:24.680 --> 53:25.806
Fast, pop it fast.

53:25.960 --> 53:27.849
Right upper cut. Right up top.

53:29.440 --> 53:31.329
Boom. Boom.

53:33.680 --> 53:34.727
Good.

53:35.160 --> 53:36.810
I want you to let it all out.

53:37.760 --> 53:38.807
Now go right here.

53:38.960 --> 53:40.962
Everyone's ever disrespected you,
see them.

53:41.880 --> 53:45.689
Anything you ever wanted go after it.

53:47.720 --> 53:49.882
Now's your time! Make a statement!

53:52.600 --> 53:53.601
One step!

53:55.160 --> 53:56.161
One punch!

53:57.920 --> 53:59.081
One round at a time!

54:07.560 --> 54:08.721
There it is.

54:08.880 --> 54:11.167
Ah! You cheated!

54:23.120 --> 54:24.201
Rock.

54:24.440 --> 54:26.204
Hey, how you doing, Pete?

54:30.520 --> 54:32.010
Something wrong?

54:33.120 --> 54:34.610
Rock, I knew.

54:34.760 --> 54:36.888
I knew there was something with this kid.

54:37.080 --> 54:40.050
Rocky, I have been trying for years
to get you to come work with us.

54:40.200 --> 54:41.247
Aw. It's okay.

54:41.400 --> 54:43.971
All of a sudden, this kid from Hollywood
gets you out of the shadows.

54:44.120 --> 54:45.610
No. No shadows.

54:45.800 --> 54:48.201
I just didn't want to do
nothing in the gym, that's all.

54:48.360 --> 54:50.931
Rocky, I made calls to L.A.

54:51.400 --> 54:52.970
Kid's name is Adonis.

54:53.120 --> 54:54.201
Kid has Creed's blood.

54:54.760 --> 54:57.331
Now this fight just got big time.

54:59.120 --> 55:00.565
I apologize.

55:01.640 --> 55:04.211
Do me a favor.
Can we keep this between ourselves?

55:04.400 --> 55:05.401
- Oh, come on.
- No.

55:05.560 --> 55:09.042
I'm asking you as a favor.
I want him to make a name on his own.

55:12.320 --> 55:13.890
Come on, Pete.

55:16.560 --> 55:19.450
Yeah. Secret's safe with me, Rock.

55:22.280 --> 55:23.361
I appreciate it.

55:32.160 --> 55:33.924
Keep going. You're looking good.

55:35.080 --> 55:36.320
Go on, get moving.

55:55.840 --> 55:57.763
Hey. So how's everybody feeling tonight?

55:57.920 --> 56:01.288
I'm about to go over the ABC rules
and the rules governed by the state.

56:01.440 --> 56:04.046
No three knockdown rule.
No standing eight-count.

56:04.200 --> 56:06.168
A fighter cannot be saved by the bell.

56:06.320 --> 56:09.802
What we mean by "no three knockdown rule"
is basically whatever the referee

56:09.960 --> 56:11.962
sees fit for competition...

56:18.320 --> 56:20.721
- Unc, cut my gloves off.
- What's wrong?

56:20.880 --> 56:21.961
My gloves, just cut 'em off!

56:22.120 --> 56:23.485
I can't cut 'em off,
you're ready to go fight.

56:23.640 --> 56:24.641
Are they too tight?

56:24.800 --> 56:26.848
I'm freaking out right now!
I gotta take a shit!

56:27.160 --> 56:29.322
Somebody gonna wipe my ass for me?

56:29.680 --> 56:31.364
- Shit!
- Cut my gloves off, Unc!

56:31.520 --> 56:33.045
All right, relax.

56:33.240 --> 56:34.890
I'll cut you out of
these gloves. It happens.

56:35.040 --> 56:36.724
Hey, ref, I'm gonna need some help here.

56:36.880 --> 56:38.291
D, I'm gonna be right outside.

56:38.440 --> 56:39.930
That's right.

56:40.120 --> 56:41.531
Can you just stall
for 10 minutes or something?

56:41.680 --> 56:42.920
I gotta put the gloves back on.

56:43.080 --> 56:44.241
All right, I'll step on outside, Rock.

56:44.400 --> 56:45.447
I appreciate it. Thank you very much.

56:45.640 --> 56:47.483
- It ain't no problem. You got 10 minutes.
- First for me, man.

56:47.840 --> 56:49.285
All right, come on. It'll be all right.

56:49.440 --> 56:50.441
Yeah.

56:50.640 --> 56:51.846
A little nervous?

56:52.520 --> 56:54.522
- Nerves?
- Hurry up!

56:58.840 --> 57:00.888
Blue corner, red corner.

57:02.000 --> 57:04.890
All right, fellas, y'all had your
instructions in the dressing room.

57:05.040 --> 57:08.328
Obey my commands at all times,
protect yourself at all times.

57:08.480 --> 57:09.925
Any questions from the blue corner?

57:10.080 --> 57:11.570
Questions from the red corner?

57:11.720 --> 57:13.688
Touch them up. Be ready on seconds out.

57:13.840 --> 57:16.366
- Right. It's about you.
- Yep. Yep.

57:16.520 --> 57:18.807
It's all about you. Now, you wanted this.

57:18.960 --> 57:20.803
- Let's go, Coach.
- I want you to make it happen.

57:20.960 --> 57:22.007
- Can you do it?
- Let's do it.

57:22.160 --> 57:23.650
- All right. Come on.
- Let's make it happen.

57:24.440 --> 57:25.601
Let's go, Unc.

57:27.720 --> 57:29.848
It's all about today!

57:30.800 --> 57:32.848
There is no tomorrow! Let's go!

57:34.080 --> 57:35.081
Nice!

57:36.400 --> 57:38.482
Move and target, move and target!

57:39.400 --> 57:41.050
Jab! It's the jab!

57:42.400 --> 57:44.607
His face is right there!
Come on! Where's the jab?

57:49.480 --> 57:51.289
Hands up. Hands up, kid.

57:59.240 --> 58:00.605
Breathe, kid, breathe!

58:06.280 --> 58:08.282
Let's go, boy! Let's go, boy!

58:08.920 --> 58:10.206
Way to get out of there.

58:11.120 --> 58:12.406
Keep moving, Donnie!

58:13.240 --> 58:15.049
Move your head! That's it.

58:15.200 --> 58:16.486
Get on him! Get on him!

58:21.000 --> 58:22.843
Break! My break!

58:23.680 --> 58:24.886
Let's go, boy!

58:25.560 --> 58:28.166
There you go! There you go! Good.

58:28.320 --> 58:29.401
Back off.

58:29.560 --> 58:31.927
Leo! Leo! Leo!

58:32.920 --> 58:34.206
One punch on top.

58:38.640 --> 58:41.530
Keep moving. That's right.
Block left. Block left.

58:47.800 --> 58:48.801
Relax.

58:49.080 --> 58:51.048
Let's go, boy!
Come get this shit! Come get it!

58:51.200 --> 58:52.611
You're doing good, kid!

58:52.760 --> 58:53.841
Keep the pressure up!

58:59.480 --> 59:00.481
Break!

59:00.720 --> 59:01.846
Let's go, Leo!

59:02.000 --> 59:03.001
Come on!

59:03.240 --> 59:04.241
Let's go.

59:04.400 --> 59:05.845
Keep moving! Keep coming forward!

59:06.640 --> 59:07.721
Great shot!

59:10.000 --> 59:11.081
Come on, Donnie!

59:14.120 --> 59:15.406
What are you doing?

59:17.360 --> 59:19.328
- Time!
- Yeah.

59:21.280 --> 59:23.169
Okay! All right.

59:24.600 --> 59:25.965
It's okay. Take a deep breath.

59:26.240 --> 59:28.049
Through your lungs.
Deep breath. Deep breath.

59:28.440 --> 59:29.441
Look at me.

59:29.680 --> 59:31.205
I like what you're doing
out there, all right?

59:31.360 --> 59:32.361
You're a little tight.

59:32.520 --> 59:33.601
You're gonna loosen up, all right?

59:33.880 --> 59:35.006
Here's what I want you to do.

59:35.160 --> 59:36.924
I want you to throw your
left under the radar.

59:37.080 --> 59:38.969
- That's it.
- Then come up with a shovel hook.

59:39.120 --> 59:42.328
You're gonna see an opening, put it
right on his chin, that'll drop him...

59:42.880 --> 59:44.689
Mouthpiece in, seconds out!

59:44.840 --> 59:47.002
Your old man did that to me. It worked.

59:47.160 --> 59:48.889
Mouthpiece in, seconds out!

59:50.320 --> 59:53.290
Leo! Leo! Leo!

01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:03.886
Come on!

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:15.891
Come on!

01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:30.330
Tie him up! That's it.
Good boy! Tie him up!

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:31.567
Break!

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:34.167
Come on!

01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:39.370
Kid, seize it now! Now! Now!

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:45.163
- Get up! Get up!
- Come on, kid! Come on!

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:46.924
- One! Two!
- Get up and get some!

01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:48.246
Three! Four!

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:49.401
We got him, Rock!

01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:51.210
Five! Six!

01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:52.885
Seven! Eight!

01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:54.809
- I'm good.
- Nine! Ten!

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.001
That's it, baby!

01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:58.208
We got one, Rock! Whoo!

01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:01.646
- We got one! Yeah, we got one!
- Unbelievable!

01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:03.205
- It's because of you!
- No, you did it.

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:05.362
Come on, man! You did it.

01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:07.887
You okay?

01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:09.041
Give him some room. Rock. Rock. Rock.

01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:10.361
Lucky shot.

01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:12.762
Come on in! Bianca! Bianca! Come in!

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:15.681
Sorry! Sorry!

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:16.921
I'm all good.

01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:19.408
You didn't say you had hands like that!

01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:21.801
Why didn't you say you had
hands like that, though?

01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:24.884
Well, but girl, I'm square though.
I'm square though.

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:26.690
You good? What we doing after this?

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:27.841
Let's go for it.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.411
- Let's go tear the city up!
- Okay.

01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:00.605
- Hey.
- Hmm.

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:02.603
I made something for you.

01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:17.163
- Keep 'em closed.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:46.451
Come listen with me.

01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:19.766
- What about your uncle?
- Huh.

01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:21.126
He's asleep.

01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:24.205
He old, man.

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:02.326
There he is.

01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:03.726
- What's up, Unc?
- Hey, how you feeling?

01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:07.441
I'm good. I'm a little sore,
but I'm all right.

01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:09.890
- You want some toast?
- Okay.

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:13.250
So you cooking or you watching?

01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:14.401
No, I'm looking you up.

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:15.891
- You're doing what?
- I'm looking you up.

01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:17.684
No, don't do that. I'm right here.

01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:24.561
Mmm.

01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:29.561
What's up?

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:31.770
You got something you wanna tell me?

01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:46.527
- I didn't lie.
- You might as well have.

01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:47.806
You told me that your dad
was some fighter.

01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:49.849
You didn't say he was the most
famous fighter to ever live.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.809
People look at me differently
when they know.

01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:53.121
They look at Apollo differently, too.

01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:55.049
Yeah, Donnie, but I'm not people.

01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:56.446
I don't care about that shit.

01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:59.046
I do care about you keeping it
100 with me, though.

01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:01.681
Well, listen. You're right, okay?

01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:04.162
No, seriously, look. You...

01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:08.561
100% honesty from here on out.

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:14.003
All right. So his...
His wife, that's not your mom?

01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:18.083
Apollo had an affair with my mom.

01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:20.642
All right? She died when I was young.

01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:23.925
I bounced around foster care
for a couple years.

01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:26.284
In and out of juvie.

01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:29.128
Then Mary Anne tracked me down
and took me in.

01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:32.011
Anything else?

01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:35.880
Ask me.

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:38.443
How many females have you
been with before me?

01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:40.602
Anything else?

01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:43.249
Look, Bianca, come on now, you different.

01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:44.447
How?

01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:46.762
When I'm around you I feel
like I know you my whole life.

01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:48.081
Mmm-hmm.

01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:49.890
Tell me you don't feel
the same way about me.

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:52.122
Whatever. That's passion.
That's infatuation. That fades.

01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:53.441
I can't see that happening.

01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:55.409
- Why not?
- You motivate me.

01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:56.766
Okay, so I'm just motivation to you?

01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:58.206
Are you gonna find a problem
with everything I say?

01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:00.283
No, I'm gonna find the real
in what you're saying.

01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:03.881
Don't worry, it's cool.

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:06.242
Maybe you're just motivation to me, too.

01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:07.766
- Oh, really?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:10.126
I don't mind that.

01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:14.081
What?

01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:17.726
You do look like him, though.

01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:19.530
Oh, my God. I hate that!

01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:21.968
Just to get on my nerves!

01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:27.645
Welcome to PTI, boys and girls.

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:29.484
We begin today with the boxing world.

01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:33.611
Adonis Johnson, a little-known boxer being
trained by Rocky Balboa

01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:36.690
handed light heavyweight
title contender Leo Sporino

01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:40.083
a second-round TKO defeat
in Philadelphia last night.

01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:42.766
An anonymous source confirmed
to ESPN that Johnson

01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:46.561
is the youngest biological son
of Apollo Creed.

01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:48.643
A fact that was kept under
wraps because Johnson

01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:50.643
was the product of Creed's infidelity.

01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:53.371
The boxing world is excited to
have another Creed in the ring

01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:57.730
but, Wilbon, does knowledge of this affair
damage Apollo Creed's legacy?

01:06:57.880 --> 01:06:59.530
Damage his legacy?
Let's go back for a second.

01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:01.409
A little history on Apollo Creed.

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:04.803
I certainly have him right up there
as maybe the best of all time.

01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:06.007
End of discussion.

01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:07.685
He slipped. He made a mistake,
like a lot of people.

01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:09.922
This isn't gonna be the first,
particularly in the boxing world!

01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:11.121
Yeah.

01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:12.970
But I'm not gonna say
it's gonna kill his legacy.

01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:14.849
I think it's an embarrassment

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.367
and I think the family must
have felt this embarrassment

01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:19.045
because they kept it
under wraps for so long.

01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:21.409
- But I really have one question.
- What?

01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:23.927
Can the kid fight as well as the old man?

01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:25.127
That's a stretch.

01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:29.883
I found us our next payday.

01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:33.646
Check it out.

01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:37.281
- Creed's son?
- Yeah.

01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:38.885
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:40.280
He's got one fight under his belt.

01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:42.249
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I know.

01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:44.289
But he's got Balboa in his corner.

01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:47.450
No one cares about Balboa anymore.

01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:50.166
Kid's here because of a name alone.

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:51.651
You're gonna do it.

01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:53.325
This guy doesn't even deserve a shot.

01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:56.006
Listen to me.
This is not a negotiation, all right?

01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:58.608
You're the idiot that ran
around Toxteth with a gun.

01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:00.245
Do you remember that?

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.322
And you are the clown who couldn't
control himself at a weigh-in

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:06.164
and lost us millions in
the process. Millions, okay?

01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:07.606
So look at it again.

01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:13.162
I don't wanna be remembered like this.

01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:15.004
I don't care how you're remembered.

01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:18.801
I care about your kids having a roof
over their head when you're done.

01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:20.371
Do you understand?

01:08:29.319 --> 01:08:30.526
Hello?

01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:33.604
It's Tommy Holiday.
I look after Ricky Conlan.

01:08:36.359 --> 01:08:37.850
- Yeah, how you doing?
- Listen.

01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:40.488
Is it true about the kid?

01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:44.370
About the kid?

01:08:47.279 --> 01:08:48.281
Uh...

01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:51.279
Think you and the kid have got 30 minutes
for a business meeting?

01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:55.491
All right, I'll tell you what.

01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:57.404
Yeah, if you can get over here, sure.

01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:00.131
We'll talk with you,
but it's gotta be fast

01:09:00.319 --> 01:09:02.049
because we're training.

01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:03.479
I can be there. Couple of days.

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:04.880
- Yeah.
- I'll be in touch.

01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:06.640
Okay.

01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:13.406
Oh, man.

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:16.721
Thanks for taking the time.
I'll get right to it.

01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:20.122
My guy needs to fight
in the next six months

01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:22.844
and we've beaten everybody.

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:25.729
You want me to fight Conlan?

01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:27.890
I think it would be a very wise move.

01:09:28.479 --> 01:09:30.403
You've been down in Mexico
doing pro fights, eh?

01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:32.761
I've got you as 15-0 down there.

01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:35.241
And with the Sporino fight,
that makes you 16-0.

01:09:35.439 --> 01:09:37.602
Now, nobody needs to know these fights

01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:40.604
were in some hole in the wall,
do they, eh?

01:09:44.439 --> 01:09:45.770
You think I'm ready?

01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:48.571
Donnie, this man came here because
he knows you're a sure thing.

01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:49.767
Right? It's a sure victory.

01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:51.444
That is not true.

01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:54.971
Yeah, it is.

01:09:58.120 --> 01:09:59.121
Okay, listen.

01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:00.600
All right.

01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:04.246
This could be my guy's last fight.

01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:06.450
And I wanna make it count.

01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:10.442
Now, on that note, we would need you
to change your name to Creed.

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:11.971
It's just a formality.

01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:19.121
And what if I say no?

01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:23.321
Well, then there's no fight.

01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:24.766
Without the name, there's no fight.

01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:26.410
It's a non-starter.

01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:29.480
Okay. Okay.

01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:33.087
Why don't you both take a day,
talk about it

01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:36.084
and we'll, uh, see what you say, okay?

01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:38.968
It's a good deal.

01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:40.571
Can't do it.

01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:42.006
Nah, it's not my name.

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:46.484
And plus, I wanna make it
on my own merit anyway.

01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:48.480
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:50.808
You got a funny way of showing it.

01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:52.686
What's that supposed to mean?

01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:55.002
I mean, weren't Apollo and Rocky
like best friends?

01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:58.642
It feels like you're trying to tap into
whatever it is he left behind.

01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:01.770
I don't think that's anything
to be ashamed of, you know?

01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:03.127
What are you afraid of?

01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:05.170
Uh, what are you afraid of?

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.001
I don't know.

01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:09.521
I mean, this hearing shit don't scare you?

01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:10.841
Uh...

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:14.126
I always knew it would happen eventually

01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:17.281
so my plan has always just been

01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:20.281
to do what I love for as long as I can.

01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:24.884
I think that's all we ever do. You know?

01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:29.044
So, what are you afraid of?

01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:33.725
I'm afraid of taking on
the name and losing.

01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:37.131
They'll call me a fraud. Fake Creed.

01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:39.521
Why don't you think about what's true?

01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:42.282
You love to fight, right?

01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:45.724
Yeah, it makes you happy, right?

01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:46.961
Yeah.

01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:50.687
Yeah, and you are
Apollo Creed's son, right?

01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:53.641
Yes.

01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:55.689
So then use the name.

01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:58.484
It's yours.

01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:14.605
Hey, Unc, you down there?

01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:16.041
Yeah.

01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:28.762
I know you don't want me
to do this, right?

01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:32.286
I can think of
better things to do, Donnie.

01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:34.205
But if we did do it

01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:37.281
how we get it done?

01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:43.161
Mmm.

01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:47.441
Well...

01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:55.646
He's taller than you.
He has a reach on you.

01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:58.771
Definitely has a lot more
experience than you.

01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:01.082
And he's faster than you are.

01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:02.605
He's the champion.

01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:05.206
And since he's the champion,

01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:08.324
you gotta bring
the fight to him, like I did.

01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:12.326
You gotta go to the body. Dig.
And in doing that

01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:15.485
you're in a very dangerous place

01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:17.324
because you can get laid out.

01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:21.006
It ain't easy for me to be
in your corner, kid.

01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:24.003
I don't know if you're ready for it.

01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:26.003
I don't know if I'm ready for it.

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:29.922
But I'll do what you wanna do.

01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:32.811
If it was anybody else in my corner

01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:34.325
I wouldn't do it.

01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:37.804
But I got you.

01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:43.010
So make the call.

01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:46.681
All right.

01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:57.363
I'm fighting Ricky Conlan.

01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:05.043
I'm fighting "Pretty" Ricky Conlan!

01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:13.042
Don't work him too hard, Rock.

01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:14.486
- Yeah.
- He's still a puppy.

01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:16.449
Come on, come on.

01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:18.763
Close the distance. That's it.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.446
Yeah. One, two.

01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:22.721
Good.

01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:24.970
Come on. Body, come here.

01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:26.645
Oh, yeah. Got a good hit.

01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:30.241
Okay.

01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:31.961
Come on.

01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:36.089
Dig deep. Body, body, body. Good.

01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:40.244
You up to moving around?

01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:42.966
Take a break.

01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:51.161
Oh. Hey, Unc, you all right?

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:52.446
- I'm all right.
- You okay?

01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:53.601
I'm all right. It's out.

01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:55.450
- I'm all right.
- All right.

01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:57.051
Just let me walk.

01:14:57.800 --> 01:14:59.040
Just... I'm good.

01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:00.201
- Sure?
- Yeah.

01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:03.769
Hey. What's wrong with you?

01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:05.570
I don't know. I don't know.

01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:06.767
Come here.

01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:08.206
Just let me walk.

01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:11.723
No, we got to call someone
and get you to the doctor, okay?

01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:12.927
- Okay.
- All right, come on.

01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:14.127
- Off the rope.
- Easy.

01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:16.527
Come on, I got you. Hey, Stitch!

01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:18.045
- I'm sorry.
- No, no. What?

01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:20.083
- No, I'm really...
- Hey, somebody help!

01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:29.201
Hi.

01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:30.521
- Hi.
- Donnie.

01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:32.131
Dr. Kathari.

01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:34.644
Mr. Balboa, how you feeling?

01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:36.842
I'm feeling good, real good.
I could go now.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.128
Heard you fell down.
Was that the first time you've fallen?

01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:41.009
Well, without being punched.

01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:43.447
I'm gonna give you some more fluids.
That should help you feel better.

01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:44.801
And we're gonna run
some tests in the morning

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.445
- and get you out of here.
- Can you do this fast?

01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:48.005
Because we got a lot of stuff to do.

01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:50.845
Just relax. All right? Go to sleep.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.128
- I'll check on you later.
- Thank you.

01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:55.408
Gotta do it fast. We have to...

01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:57.406
Donnie, we gotta train.

01:15:57.560 --> 01:15:59.050
Yeah, go to sleep.

01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:09.124
You guys need any more help?

01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:10.964
- No! We're good.
- No, we're good, thank you!

01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:12.121
- You got it? What you need?
- Nothing.

01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:13.281
Thought you got lost for a minute.

01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:18.244
I have not seen food
that look like this in this house ever.

01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:19.526
Yeah?

01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:23.930
Yes. You know, usually everything
I have has sauce or something on it.

01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:25.400
Get some of these collard greens.

01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:26.846
All right. You just...

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:28.445
- Just a little bit?
- Yeah, a little bit.

01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:31.041
Bianca, you're beautiful

01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:33.487
and I think you'll be a great singer.

01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:36.530
I think you're gonna be a
great champ, like your father.

01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:38.125
Maybe even better.

01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:41.767
And for me, who's lucky enough
to be knowing both of you guys.

01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:44.685
Here we go. Cent'anni. 100 years.

01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:46.001
I'm honored.

01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:47.326
Lucky me.

01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:51.329
Keep working on that shovel hook.

01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:52.561
Ah.

01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:54.001
Right, that's it.

01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:56.481
Now, I wanna throw the hook
on the same side.

01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:59.166
So you come up on the right,
you throw on the right.

01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:00.481
Very good.

01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:04.647
A little more vicious than that,
little more power.

01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:07.963
Overdo it. Yeah! Very good.

01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:09.246
Hey, Rock.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.126
Yeah.

01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:12.725
Good. You're looking good.

01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:14.006
Are you getting jealous?

01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:16.128
Yeah, a little.

01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:20.410
- It's for you.
- Thanks.

01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:23.205
Hello? Yeah?

01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:24.481
Yeah.

01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:30.450
Yeah, okay.

01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:32.485
All right, thanks.

01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:40.925
Mr. Balboa.

01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:46.647
Thanks for coming in on such short notice.

01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:54.043
Well, we went through your test results
and your biopsy came back showing signs

01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:57.363
of large cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:00.330
What's that do?

01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:03.286
Well, it's a form of cancer.

01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:13.850
I know that sounds scary,

01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:16.168
but the good news is we caught it early.

01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:18.722
However, we will have to
remove the tumor in

01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:21.571
your lymph nodes and start
chemotherapy immediately.

01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:25.848
My wife tried that.

01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:28.928
Mr. Balboa, as far as
options for treatment,

01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:30.730
this is the best plan of action.

01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:33.167
No, I understand, but my wife tried that,

01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:36.051
and I don't think I wanna do it.

01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:38.328
Didn't turn out so good. But it's okay.

01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:41.091
With treatment, you'll still have
a very good chance of recovery.

01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:43.525
Without it...

01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:47.924
I'm okay with it, really.

01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:50.131
Well, at least take these.

01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:54.281
It has information on your diagnosis
and options for treatment.

01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:56.642
- We can start...
- Thank you very much.

01:18:57.240 --> 01:19:00.847
Listen, I'd appreciate if you wouldn't
say nothing to nobody, okay?

01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:10.324
Oh, man! There's so much traffic,
you wouldn't believe it.

01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:12.244
That senior bus was running late, huh?

01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:14.528
Hey, that's a cheap shot.

01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:16.326
- It's the truth.
- Get in the ring.

01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:18.249
- Hurry up and get ready.
- I've been ready.

01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:20.602
- Good.
- I've been waiting on you.

01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:24.810
Oh, come on, just put your gloves on
and stop talking so much.

01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:37.688
We got a few things to do.

01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:40.286
- It's all about you.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:42.921
I already had my career. I did okay.

01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:45.401
What's your excuse? You got no excuse.

01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:49.281
Now is the time for you to
rise to the occasion there.

01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:50.726
- Just gonna put my...
- I can do it.

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:52.848
Okay, all right.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:55.001
Now...

01:19:56.240 --> 01:20:00.086
I want you to always, always,
always pay attention to yourself first.

01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:01.287
Right.

01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:03.801
If I'm not here to start with,
just start moving around.

01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:05.086
All right. Mouthpiece.

01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:06.651
Know what I'm saying?

01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:10.245
Too many punches to the head, huh?

01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:11.401
Yeah, whatever, coach.

01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:13.005
All right, get going there, champ.

01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:14.481
Bell.

01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:15.960
Come on, Creed!

01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:26.890
Be first, Donnie. Come on!

01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:31.041
All right, Amir.

01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:33.168
All right, champ. Don't work too hard.

01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:55.650
This shit for real?

01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:00.686
Doesn't matter.

01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:04.645
What you should be thinking
about is that fight coming up.

01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:07.246
That's the only thing that should
be on your mind, nothing else.

01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:09.607
What you mean, don't think about this?
When you starting treatment?

01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:14.721
I'm not doing no chemotherapy. No.

01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:17.242
If you don't jump on this quick,
you're gonna end up dying.

01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:20.205
I know.

01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:22.169
And you're all right with that?

01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:25.006
I am.

01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:27.843
Man, you sound crazy, man.
Give me the keys.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:29.081
I'll take you to the hospital right now.

01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:30.361
I'm not crazy at all.

01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:32.648
If I could take everything that was good

01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:35.406
and put it into a bowl or something

01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:39.562
and say, "Hey! Here. I'd like to
"buy one more day with my wife,"

01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:41.401
I'd do it.

01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:44.564
I would die a happy man, right then.

01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:46.890
Not gonna happen.

01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:55.566
So, everything I got has
moved on and I'm here.

01:21:56.560 --> 01:21:59.370
But you know what? It's okay.

01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:04.007
Because I said to myself,
"If I break, if I'm hurt, whatever.

01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:06.288
"I ain't gonna fix it. Why bother?"

01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:09.520
And I'm just some bum just living
in your crib, just nothing.

01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:11.530
You're a good kid, a good fighter.

01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:14.282
But you got your
whole future ahead of you.

01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:15.601
Mine?

01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:21.169
Back there, like
all them guys on that wall.

01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:24.365
In the back, in the past.

01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:26.524
We're going nowhere.

01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:29.441
I am to you just an old trainer.

01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:32.524
That's what brought us together. You know?

01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:34.730
We're not a real family.

01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:41.723
That was just in our heads, kid.

01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:54.529
Oh, what'd you do? What'd you do?

01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:05.249
Why'd you say that?

01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:26.762
Hey, what's up, Lil Creed?

01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:28.731
It's good.

01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:34.885
- Oh, hey!
- What's up, bro?

01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:36.166
- Hey!
- What up?

01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:37.441
Hi!

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:40.206
You okay?

01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:43.161
Yeah. How you doing? You good?

01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:45.284
Yeah, I'm good. I'm a little nervous.

01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:47.727
There's just a lot of people here,
not really my crowd, you know?

01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:48.881
Yeah, I can see.

01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:50.730
Look, it's the boxing boy,
Lil Apollo Creed.

01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:52.530
I know his girl.

01:23:52.680 --> 01:23:53.727
What's up, Bianca?

01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:56.083
- Hey.
- You don't know nobody no more?

01:23:56.240 --> 01:23:57.287
Nah, I said hello to you
when I walked past.

01:23:57.480 --> 01:23:58.527
You didn't say nothing to me.

01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:00.449
Yeah, I bet you did.
Stop acting light-skinned.

01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:03.486
Why don't you come over here and grab
this pic with me real quick for the 'Gram?

01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:04.881
Yeah, that's cool.

01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:07.564
Come on, man. You know he busy, man.

01:24:07.720 --> 01:24:09.085
Welcome to my city, champ.

01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:13.130
- There it is, Abbie.
- Believe dat.

01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:14.891
Hey, good looking, Baby Creed.

01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:16.326
Don't call me that.

01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:17.971
Don't call you that? Don't call you what?

01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:20.726
You just called me "Baby Creed."
I said, don't call me that.

01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:23.249
Hey, fam, dig this.
I was showing you love, man.

01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:24.561
You ain't got to come off like that.

01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:26.131
Yeah, that's cool, that's cool,
that's all love.

01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:28.482
I know it's cool.
You definitely know it's cool.

01:24:28.640 --> 01:24:30.961
When you talking to me,
you talking real tough, you feel me?

01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:32.531
Better talk to your little
pretty boy boyfriend, man.

01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:35.166
Get a VIP pass next to your
pop, talking to me like that.

01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:37.602
- No!
- Hold up, nigga!

01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:40.326
Donnie! Donnie! Donnie!

01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:44.326
Donnie! Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it! Stop it!

01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:45.606
I'll kill your ass!

01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:46.761
Donnie! Donnie!

01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:48.920
How's he doing?

01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:50.081
He's all right now.

01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:51.765
- You know what happened?
- We had to separate him.

01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:53.251
He was fighting with the other inmates.

01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:54.646
Oh, no. Anybody get hurt?

01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:56.086
Nah, nothing life-threatening.

01:24:56.240 --> 01:24:58.129
- All right, thank you.
- No problem, champ.

01:24:58.320 --> 01:24:59.321
Yeah.

01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:01.526
Hey, Donnie.

01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:08.210
How you doing, son?

01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:11.967
I know a lot of cops and they said,

01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:13.485
"Your friend's locked up."

01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:16.531
Friends?
You're just a trainer to me, right?

01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:21.640
I'm sorry about what I said
to you, back at the gym.

01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:23.330
That was just me talking.
I didn't mean it.

01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:25.005
You just stay away from me.

01:25:26.440 --> 01:25:27.646
Listen, Donnie...

01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:29.529
- Man, don't touch me.
- Come on, what...

01:25:29.680 --> 01:25:31.648
Get your hands off me, old man!

01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:34.167
Get your sick ass out of here!

01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:37.041
Leave!

01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:40.210
You here talking like you my family!
You got my real family killed!

01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:52.562
I ain't leaving

01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:55.371
till I tell you what's on my mind.

01:25:56.520 --> 01:25:58.568
You hate me, that's what it is.

01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:00.563
Or maybe you're mad with somebody

01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:04.202
who ain't here, Donnie,
who can't defend himself.

01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:06.686
You know?

01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:08.922
Now, I understand what you're
going through, young man.

01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:10.081
I've been there.

01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:12.602
And I know what it's like
to feel abandoned,

01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:14.683
and be mad at everything.

01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:16.888
And you're a better person than that.

01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:21.762
Forgive him. Because there's
nothing you can do about it.

01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:23.524
It's taking a toll on you.

01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:29.682
You're still caught in his shadow.

01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:33.444
You got to move, Donnie.

01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:35.450
Just leave, man.

01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:23.845
Let's go, Johnson.

01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:51.086
Bianca!

01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:54.648
Yo! Stop knocking on my door
like the police.

01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:55.847
Can you at least let me apologize?

01:27:56.040 --> 01:27:57.201
No, it doesn't work like that.

01:27:57.360 --> 01:27:59.169
You apologize when you spill
a drink on someone's shirt.

01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:03.522
But you assaulted the headliner to my show,
a show I worked really hard to get.

01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:05.882
What if I came to your fight
acting like an ass?

01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:07.485
Would that be cool with you?

01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:09.486
Nah, I didn't think so.

01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:14.330
How'd you do though? You kill it?

01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:16.645
Yeah, we did good.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.162
I messed that up and I gotta
live with that, all right?

01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:20.560
But I never meant to let you down.

01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:22.324
Then what did you mean to do, D?

01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:24.727
Just have a little ego contest?

01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:32.041
Rocky's sick.

01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:44.571
He's got cancer.

01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:46.927
I ain't trying to make excuses
for anything that I did,

01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:49.162
but I found out right before your show.

01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:50.401
How bad is it?

01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:54.322
They want him to start chemo
but, you know, he's too macho to do that.

01:28:56.680 --> 01:28:57.727
Jesus.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.606
Well, maybe you can talk
some sense into him.

01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:08.287
I don't think he'd wanna hear
anything I got to say.

01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:14.287
Yeah, well, give him my love.

01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:17.445
Hey, Bianca, don't close me out right now.

01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:22.769
Look, we both got a lot going on right now
so I think you should focus on yours

01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:24.200
and I'm gonna focus on mine.

01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:25.441
I'm sorry.

01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:27.766
What's that mean?

01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:30.689
I get it, I messed up.

01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:35.564
I trusted you!
Can you please not shut me out?

01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:40.405
I'm sorry, okay?

01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:44.050
I need you right now.

01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:20.851
Nigga, what's up?

01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:22.281
What's up?

01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:25.448
Hey, I heard you Apollo Creed's son.

01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:30.001
Yeah.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:33.286
That's what's up.

01:31:17.400 --> 01:31:20.847
Look like you lost five pounds.
You ought to sit down and eat.

01:31:34.880 --> 01:31:36.530
I mean, what I look like?

01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:39.405
Letting you train me
while you sit around and die?

01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:46.563
Just like any other fight.

01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:50.921
This fight? I seen it before.

01:31:52.520 --> 01:31:54.921
It gets as bad as it can get

01:31:56.400 --> 01:31:58.767
and most of the time, you don't win it.

01:31:58.920 --> 01:32:00.081
Yeah, but I don't care.

01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:02.601
I ain't training if you
don't get the treatment.

01:32:02.760 --> 01:32:05.127
So if I fight, you fight.

01:32:37.800 --> 01:32:39.529
- Hey.
- What's up?

01:32:39.680 --> 01:32:41.091
You been to the gym?

01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:42.726
Nah, I've been here.

01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:45.724
Okay. Here you go. Remember this?

01:32:46.240 --> 01:32:47.480
Get up.

01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:49.526
- Ready?
- What's...

01:32:49.680 --> 01:32:51.125
I want you to shadow box.

01:32:51.280 --> 01:32:53.442
This is a nice room,
let's see you move around.

01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:54.601
You're serious?

01:32:54.760 --> 01:32:56.524
- Want me to do it for you?
- No. It's all good.

01:32:56.680 --> 01:32:58.489
- Yeah, ready?
- Come on.

01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:00.324
Time!

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:02.286
There you go.

01:33:09.720 --> 01:33:11.131
We used to do that with one hand.

01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:14.841
I don't wanna say anything though.

01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:16.401
Two...

01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:21.090
Don't hit the lady.

01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:23.001
She'll probably drop you.

01:33:34.120 --> 01:33:36.202
All right. Come on, almost there.

01:33:36.920 --> 01:33:38.251
Come on, Unc.

01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:45.406
Oh, God.

01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:20.285
Come on, let's go.

01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:25.527
Yeah, yes!

01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:27.768
That's your thing, yes! More! Yes!

01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:33.486
- One. Two? The deal was two!
- I can't, no.

01:34:33.640 --> 01:34:34.926
I'm dizzy.

01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:46.886
Double jab.

01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:48.206
Step on right under there.

01:34:55.720 --> 01:34:56.721
Good.

01:34:57.240 --> 01:34:58.605
At least we got the speed.

01:34:58.760 --> 01:35:02.446
We just need him to sit down
so when he hits something, he breaks it.

01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:06.921
Good.

01:35:07.240 --> 01:35:09.322
Step with it, you gotta step
with it. Come on!

01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:12.086
Little bit more.

01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:14.083
Little bit more, dig down. Good.

01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:15.651
Good. Keep it right.

01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:17.201
Yes!

01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:19.681
Look, he's doing the same thing.

01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:21.285
Yeah, he does, it looks that way.

01:35:21.480 --> 01:35:24.165
But I think he's got something
up his sleeve for you.

01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:38.647
Wow, beautiful.

01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:41.445
Yo, you going to see Rock?

01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:43.568
Yeah, let's go! We got you! Let's go!

01:35:43.720 --> 01:35:45.484
Make history, Creed! Let's go!

01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:51.801
What up? Come on, y'all!
Let's ride! Come on!

01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:53.606
That's what I like, man!

01:35:53.760 --> 01:35:56.604
Let's go see Rock on Front Street!
Ride with me!

01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:47.245
You wanna say hello?

01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:50.805
Place looks like a church.

01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:52.405
Yeah, feel like an art museum.

01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:53.800
Yeah, beautiful.

01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:56.887
The fight starts in about two minutes.

01:37:57.040 --> 01:37:59.088
As soon as he shows up,
he's gonna start on you.

01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:00.361
Okay.

01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:16.765
Don't let him get to you.

01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:18.803
Okay, great. Thank you all for coming.

01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:20.803
Let's get straight into questions.

01:38:21.640 --> 01:38:23.483
Uh, young lady to the left.

01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:26.644
Conlan, can we expect
any more fireworks at the weigh-in?

01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:28.370
I've been doing some
anger management classes

01:38:28.520 --> 01:38:30.488
and trying to control that temper of mine.

01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:32.927
I just gotta make sure he forgets it all
by Saturday night.

01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:37.011
Okay, next question.

01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:38.491
Young man in the glasses.

01:38:38.680 --> 01:38:40.762
What about the contrast between you two?

01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:44.163
You, the overnight success versus
Conlan's rags to riches background.

01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:45.686
Nothing happened overnight.

01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:47.171
I've been fighting for some time now...

01:38:47.320 --> 01:38:48.685
That's exactly
how it happened for this guy.

01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:51.525
He's an overnight success,
never had a damn fight in his life.

01:38:52.040 --> 01:38:54.520
He's got this shot because
he found that name last night.

01:38:54.680 --> 01:38:57.365
One more. There's a lot
of talk about legacy in this fight.

01:38:57.520 --> 01:38:58.851
Johnson, can you speak to that?

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:00.968
Yeah, I've been working on
trying to build my own legacy.

01:39:01.240 --> 01:39:03.641
Legacy? Are we at some
kind of comedy club?

01:39:03.800 --> 01:39:06.849
The guy next to him, now that's
what we're talking about legacy.

01:39:07.040 --> 01:39:08.371
- And I'm cut from that cloth.
- Don't fall for it.

01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:10.090
My father worked on the docks.

01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:12.409
His father was heavyweight
champion of the world.

01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:14.289
People like Silver Spoon over there...

01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:16.647
- You don't know nothing about me.
- I know enough about you.

01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:18.126
- I'm here now though.
- You found yourself here.

01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:19.281
- I'm here now.
- You a false Creed.

01:39:19.440 --> 01:39:20.965
All right, I'll show you right now.
My pops ain't here.

01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:22.121
Sit down!

01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:23.486
You wanna fight here?
I'll do it right now!

01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:25.842
I can do it right now, bitch!
We can do it right now!

01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:29.608
- "Creed" my asshole!
- Keep it down!

01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:32.001
- Yo, you okay? Good?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:33.771
Okay, we'll see what's up.

01:39:34.520 --> 01:39:36.807
I'm gonna knock that smile off your face.

01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:45.208
Yo, Donnie, it's Rock.

01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:50.924
Unc, you okay?

01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:53.321
Yeah, I'm good. Just couldn't sleep.

01:39:53.480 --> 01:39:55.801
- Yeah, me either.
- Is it okay I sit down?

01:39:55.960 --> 01:39:56.961
Course.

01:39:58.240 --> 01:39:59.366
Donnie...

01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:03.369
I'd like you to do me a favor
when all this is over.

01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:05.045
- Yeah, anything.
- Okay, good.

01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:08.682
It's not important but just...
I wanna lock it in, okay?

01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:10.205
Yeah, you got it.

01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:11.731
There you go.

01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:16.371
You okay, huh?

01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:17.760
Yeah, why?

01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:21.044
No, you keep looking at the door.

01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:22.287
No!

01:40:23.720 --> 01:40:25.165
Mmm-mmm.

01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:29.605
Do you hear something?

01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:31.201
No.

01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:35.450
Who is that?

01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:37.045
I don't know.

01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:45.931
How you doing, Bianca?
What are you doing here?

01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:48.641
Y'all two are killing me.

01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:53.489
Oh, and listen.
Would you guys just keep...

01:40:53.640 --> 01:40:54.766
We know.

01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:56.001
- Leg thing.
- Yeah.

01:40:56.160 --> 01:40:57.525
- The legs, yeah.
- It's important.

01:40:57.680 --> 01:40:58.761
Got you.

01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:05.006
You wanna come in?

01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:07.007
Yeah.

01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:08.601
Please.

01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:25.007
- I got it.
- Good.

01:41:25.160 --> 01:41:26.685
All right.

01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:29.441
All right.

01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:35.010
A lot of room.

01:41:35.760 --> 01:41:37.808
Didn't we have enough
surprises for one weekend?

01:41:38.680 --> 01:41:40.091
That's not me.

01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:14.049
Very nice colors.

01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:18.443
Why don't you take 'em into the other room
and see how well they fit.

01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:22.441
Yeah.

01:42:24.760 --> 01:42:25.921
Hey, champ.

01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:28.606
All right, Donnie. I'm proud of you.

01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:30.769
That's gonna bring him luck.

01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:56.127
You never been in front of
this many people before, right?

01:42:56.280 --> 01:42:57.611
That don't matter.

01:42:57.760 --> 01:42:59.888
You've never been this far away from home.

01:43:00.040 --> 01:43:01.326
That don't matter.

01:43:01.480 --> 01:43:04.563
What matters is
what you leave in that ring

01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:06.609
and what you take back with you.

01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:08.245
You know what that is?

01:43:08.520 --> 01:43:11.364
Pride. And knowing that you did your best.

01:43:11.640 --> 01:43:13.290
And you're doing it for yourself.

01:43:13.440 --> 01:43:17.764
Not for me, not your father's memory,
but for you.

01:43:18.120 --> 01:43:21.650
I can see in your eyes you're gonna do it.

01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:24.761
Let's go now.

01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:26.126
Padman.

01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:31.650
Fight's right here.

01:43:34.640 --> 01:43:35.801
Let's go.

01:43:39.640 --> 01:43:40.801
Yeah.

01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:42.611
Left hook combination.

01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:46.451
- Yeah.
- Come on, man. There you go!

01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:47.601
Go up top.

01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:51.010
All right, guys, it's time.

01:43:51.200 --> 01:43:52.929
Let's go win a championship!

01:43:53.120 --> 01:43:55.168
- It's time, baby.
- Let's go, guys.

01:43:59.160 --> 01:44:00.366
Come on, man.

01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:08.000
Let's go.

01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:27.888
I'd always get nervous during
times like this,

01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:31.169
but that's normal,
and it's gonna give you energy.

01:44:31.320 --> 01:44:33.448
Pretty normal. Very normal.

01:45:36.080 --> 01:45:38.208
Go up there and show him who you are!

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:44.570
Conlan!

01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:06.131
This is what you wanted, and what you got.

01:46:06.280 --> 01:46:08.931
And I want you to enjoy it, okay? Do that.

01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:17.247
Conlan! Conlan!

01:47:26.800 --> 01:47:29.770
Hello again. I'm Jim Lampley.
Here comes Ricky Conlan.

01:47:29.960 --> 01:47:33.362
100,000 on their feet
for what may conceivably be

01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:36.171
his last walk to the ring
for a professional fight.

01:47:36.320 --> 01:47:40.006
Max Kellerman, what chance
does the young American have?

01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:42.561
He's got the name.
That's why he's here tonight.

01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:44.290
Does he have the game?

01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:47.523
He's Apollo Creed's son,
he's got Rocky Balboa in his corner.

01:47:47.680 --> 01:47:49.330
But all the legends in the world

01:47:49.520 --> 01:47:52.285
can't help him tonight if he can't fight.

01:47:52.480 --> 01:47:55.882
The question is, can he fight?

01:48:19.080 --> 01:48:21.924
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Goodison Park

01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:24.401
here in Liverpool, England,

01:48:24.600 --> 01:48:27.444
where tonight this is the main event.

01:48:27.640 --> 01:48:29.608
Twelve rounds of boxing

01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:33.082
for the light heavyweight
championship of the world.

01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:35.561
For the thousands in attendance

01:48:35.720 --> 01:48:38.326
and the millions
watching around the world,

01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:42.360
ladies and gentlemen,
let's get ready to rumble!

01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:49.844
In the red corner, wearing
the stars and stripes,

01:48:50.040 --> 01:48:54.204
his professional record,
16 fights 16 victories.

01:48:54.360 --> 01:48:55.566
The challenger,

01:48:55.720 --> 01:49:01.523
Adonis "Hollywood" Creed!

01:49:01.720 --> 01:49:03.882
And fighting out of the blue corner,

01:49:04.040 --> 01:49:05.644
wearing black with blue

01:49:05.800 --> 01:49:08.881
with 36 fights, 28 KOs,

01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:12.523
he's the light heavyweight
champion of the world,

01:49:12.680 --> 01:49:19.290
"Pretty" Ricky Conlan!

01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:27.005
- Okay, let's go.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:49:32.840 --> 01:49:34.763
How you doing, lads?
You know what I expect of you both.

01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:36.291
We talked about it in the locker rooms.

01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:39.211
I want you to protect yourselves
and obey my commands at all times.

01:49:39.400 --> 01:49:43.405
No low blows, no silly business.
Keep it clean, will you? Understand?

01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:44.921
Touch gloves.

01:49:45.560 --> 01:49:46.891
Nice shorts, boy.

01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:49.281
Too bad your daddy ain't here
to fight in them.

01:49:50.760 --> 01:49:52.205
You know what?

01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:55.091
You're gonna close his big mouth, okay?

01:49:58.240 --> 01:49:59.685
- You know what to do.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:49:59.840 --> 01:50:02.241
One step, one punch, one round at a time.

01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:03.886
You got this.

01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:17.970
Round one begins.

01:50:18.120 --> 01:50:20.566
"Pretty" Ricky Conlan in the black trunks,

01:50:20.720 --> 01:50:23.963
and Adonis Creed
in the red, white and blue.

01:50:24.120 --> 01:50:26.851
Conlan is significantly taller

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.446
and thinks it will be easy to use his jab

01:50:29.640 --> 01:50:31.449
to keep young Creed at bay.

01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:32.641
You can see right away, Jim,

01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:35.201
how much more relaxed Conlan is.
He's been there before.

01:50:35.360 --> 01:50:36.407
Move your head!

01:50:36.560 --> 01:50:37.607
Keep your left up!

01:50:37.760 --> 01:50:40.570
That kind of nervous energy
can wear you out as the fight goes on.

01:50:40.760 --> 01:50:42.842
Hard left hook by Conlan. Creed backs off.

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.731
It's not easy to just jump right
into the major leagues like this,

01:50:45.920 --> 01:50:47.604
having never fought
an opponent like Conlan.

01:50:47.800 --> 01:50:50.201
Of course, there aren't
many fighters like Conlan.

01:50:50.360 --> 01:50:52.840
Creed trying to get close
to Conlan, against the ropes.

01:50:53.160 --> 01:50:55.606
Conlan easily puts distance
between them again.

01:50:56.360 --> 01:50:58.203
Creed lands a jab, Conlan grins at it.

01:50:58.760 --> 01:51:01.969
Conlan fires a hard body punch,
hits him hard with a right cross

01:51:02.120 --> 01:51:03.770
and backs Creed into the ropes.

01:51:03.920 --> 01:51:05.365
- Break!
- Ref, come on!

01:51:05.600 --> 01:51:06.601
Keep it clean!

01:51:06.800 --> 01:51:08.211
And he gets a warning from the referee.

01:51:08.640 --> 01:51:11.810
Creed kinda woke him up with that shot
and Conlan really made him pay for it.

01:51:12.640 --> 01:51:14.244
Creed ready to let his hands go.

01:51:15.640 --> 01:51:17.369
Creed misses and gets hit in return.

01:51:17.880 --> 01:51:19.530
To your corner! One!

01:51:19.720 --> 01:51:20.926
Perfect uppercut on the inside.

01:51:21.080 --> 01:51:22.206
- Down goes Creed.
- Two!

01:51:22.400 --> 01:51:23.686
- Three! Four!
- I'm good. I'm good!

01:51:23.840 --> 01:51:24.921
- Five! Six!
- I'm good!

01:51:25.360 --> 01:51:26.361
Shake it off!

01:51:26.560 --> 01:51:28.528
But already a knockdown for Ricky Conlan.

01:51:28.680 --> 01:51:29.806
- Are you okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:51:29.960 --> 01:51:31.086
- Are you sure?
- I'm good!

01:51:31.320 --> 01:51:32.367
Fight!

01:51:34.760 --> 01:51:39.049
Conlan lands a shot after the bell,
and round one was all Ricky Conlan.

01:51:39.200 --> 01:51:42.044
Real for you now, boy? Real for you now?

01:51:45.640 --> 01:51:47.130
- How's the eye?
- Little bloody.

01:51:47.280 --> 01:51:48.884
All right, look. Don't get rattled.

01:51:49.040 --> 01:51:50.121
I'm gonna knock his ass out.

01:51:50.280 --> 01:51:51.770
Do it in the next round. Don't wait.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:53.365
You keep making mistakes like that,

01:51:53.560 --> 01:51:55.324
we're gonna pick you up
with a vacuum cleaner, okay?

01:51:55.520 --> 01:51:57.887
Adonis was lucky there wasn't
another 30 seconds in that round.

01:52:00.040 --> 01:52:01.883
Come on, baby. What you doing?

01:52:02.200 --> 01:52:03.725
Here's what I want you to do.

01:52:03.880 --> 01:52:05.848
He's gonna jab and throw the right.

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.731
When he leaves it out there,
drop that right hook and smash him, okay?

01:52:08.880 --> 01:52:10.211
Stay focused.

01:52:10.360 --> 01:52:13.409
So round one was a forbidding
experience for young Adonis Creed.

01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:16.484
And now, after a discussion
with Rocky Balboa between rounds,

01:52:16.640 --> 01:52:18.051
he comes in for more.

01:52:18.200 --> 01:52:21.568
Conlan showed his power
with the uppercut at the end of round one,

01:52:21.720 --> 01:52:24.200
goes back to boxing to begin the second.

01:52:24.360 --> 01:52:26.362
- Be first!
- Keep the pressure on, Rick!

01:52:26.520 --> 01:52:30.730
Logic says Creed needs to find a way
to get inside of Conlan's long arms

01:52:30.880 --> 01:52:32.769
and create pressure on the inside.

01:52:32.920 --> 01:52:33.921
Come on! Come on!

01:52:34.080 --> 01:52:36.162
So far, it's still mostly Ricky Conlan.

01:52:37.560 --> 01:52:39.164
Hard left hook for Conlan, uppercut.

01:52:39.320 --> 01:52:40.446
Keep your hands up!

01:52:40.600 --> 01:52:41.761
Drives Creed into the corner again.

01:52:41.920 --> 01:52:43.251
Tie him up!

01:52:44.200 --> 01:52:47.522
Creed wraps him up and
pulls him in to stop the onslaught.

01:52:47.680 --> 01:52:49.444
You the champ, right, huh?

01:52:49.600 --> 01:52:50.840
You the champ?

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:52.411
Show me. Come on!

01:52:54.520 --> 01:52:56.841
There's a perfect
right-hand shot by Creed!

01:52:57.040 --> 01:52:58.405
- Yeah!
- Yes!

01:53:01.360 --> 01:53:04.409
Creed misses wildly,
and they are going toe-to-toe.

01:53:04.560 --> 01:53:06.289
Rapidly becoming a phone booth fight!

01:53:06.440 --> 01:53:07.566
Go! Go!

01:53:07.720 --> 01:53:09.609
Trading punches, right hand, left hand!

01:53:09.800 --> 01:53:10.881
Both guys landing!

01:53:11.040 --> 01:53:12.530
This is unbelievable action!

01:53:12.720 --> 01:53:13.721
Double hook! Come on!

01:53:14.120 --> 01:53:16.088
Hard right hand by Creed.

01:53:16.240 --> 01:53:18.607
- You bleed just like me!
- Go to your corners! Come on!

01:53:18.760 --> 01:53:19.761
You bleed just like me!

01:53:19.920 --> 01:53:22.048
Man! That ain't shit!

01:53:22.200 --> 01:53:25.966
He loves it! If Conlan thought
he had a pushover, he knows better now!

01:53:26.120 --> 01:53:27.201
He bleed like me!

01:53:27.400 --> 01:53:28.401
You belong in here!

01:53:28.560 --> 01:53:30.244
They don't know what you've been through

01:53:30.400 --> 01:53:32.050
and they sure don't know
what we've been through.

01:53:32.240 --> 01:53:33.605
I don't want you trading blows with him.

01:53:33.760 --> 01:53:35.569
I want you to protect yourself.

01:53:35.720 --> 01:53:36.767
Keep your distance!

01:53:36.920 --> 01:53:38.251
I'm gonna smash this kid to bits.

01:53:38.400 --> 01:53:40.243
Now he knows you're for real.

01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:41.561
You gotta believe you can do it.

01:53:41.720 --> 01:53:43.722
That was such a big round for Creed.

01:53:43.920 --> 01:53:46.605
Not just on the scorecards
but psychologically going forward, Jim.

01:53:46.760 --> 01:53:48.250
You woke up a sleeping giant.

01:53:48.400 --> 01:53:50.289
He's gonna come after you
with everything he's got.

01:53:50.440 --> 01:53:52.920
Adonis, looking more and more
comfortable against the champ

01:53:53.080 --> 01:53:55.082
seems to have found his rhythm.

01:53:56.440 --> 01:53:57.601
Go finish him off.

01:54:00.920 --> 01:54:02.285
This has devolved into a slugfest!

01:54:02.480 --> 01:54:04.608
- One punch at a time!
- Come on, D!

01:54:05.080 --> 01:54:07.447
Conlan trying to punish
Creed at short range.

01:54:07.600 --> 01:54:08.761
Finish him now!

01:54:08.920 --> 01:54:11.491
Big combination to end the third by Conlan

01:54:11.640 --> 01:54:14.930
and Creed does not know where he is,
walking to the wrong corner there.

01:54:15.080 --> 01:54:16.081
His arm is long.

01:54:16.280 --> 01:54:18.442
Because you're playing his game, Donnie.

01:54:18.600 --> 01:54:19.601
Be patient.

01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:21.489
One step, one punch.

01:54:21.640 --> 01:54:23.130
- One round at a time.
- There you go.

01:54:23.280 --> 01:54:25.521
One step, one punch,

01:54:25.760 --> 01:54:27.000
one round at a time.

01:54:27.160 --> 01:54:29.811
Round five of a scheduled 12
and already it's a far different fight

01:54:29.960 --> 01:54:31.121
than most experts expected.

01:54:31.280 --> 01:54:32.281
He's just a pretender.

01:54:32.440 --> 01:54:34.283
He's lucky to be in the same
ring with you hitting him.

01:54:34.440 --> 01:54:35.441
Remember that.

01:54:35.600 --> 01:54:39.765
Adonis Creed has succeeded in pressuring
Ricky Conlan and making him fight.

01:55:03.080 --> 01:55:04.889
Creed has proven plenty in this fight.

01:55:05.080 --> 01:55:06.923
He's taken it, he's given it back.

01:55:07.080 --> 01:55:08.809
But he does not look like a match

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:10.843
for the best pound-for-pound
fighter in the world.

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.287
You're going through hell out there
but you're hurting him, too.

01:55:13.440 --> 01:55:14.646
I can see it in his eyes.

01:55:14.840 --> 01:55:16.330
You're not as far behind as you think.

01:55:16.520 --> 01:55:18.488
Shorten that jab, shorten the distance,

01:55:18.680 --> 01:55:20.728
get underneath him,
and you'll be able to rip him.

01:55:20.880 --> 01:55:22.166
You gotta push him back.

01:55:22.320 --> 01:55:25.005
Most critics didn't think
Creed could make it this far.

01:55:25.160 --> 01:55:26.286
Donnie, step under!

01:55:28.440 --> 01:55:30.010
- Yes!
- Come on, Ricky!

01:55:30.160 --> 01:55:32.606
There are moments when Creed
is assertively taking over.

01:55:32.760 --> 01:55:35.843
But there's a hard counter right,
drives Creed back into the corner.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.002
Just when it appears Creed
might be taking control

01:55:38.200 --> 01:55:40.123
Conlan comes close to knocking him down.

01:55:40.280 --> 01:55:41.361
Use that pressure.

01:55:41.520 --> 01:55:42.567
You are the one
that's in the driving seat.

01:55:42.720 --> 01:55:44.131
He's not used to this level, all right?

01:55:44.280 --> 01:55:45.691
Get 'em on the rope.

01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:47.410
Get 'em on the rope! Deep breath.

01:55:47.560 --> 01:55:48.607
Boy's fast.

01:55:48.760 --> 01:55:50.922
Hey! It's you against you.

01:55:51.160 --> 01:55:52.525
- Me against me.
- That's right.

01:55:52.680 --> 01:55:53.920
- He's just in your way.
- Got it.

01:55:54.080 --> 01:55:55.411
Get him out of the way! Let's go!

01:55:55.560 --> 01:55:58.962
Not only is young
Adonis Creed still in the ring,

01:55:59.120 --> 01:56:01.122
he may be in the fight.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.128
Hard left hand by Creed.

01:56:05.400 --> 01:56:07.721
Conlan was an overwhelmingly
heavy favorite

01:56:07.880 --> 01:56:11.726
pounding young Creed with right hands
as you saw right there.

01:56:14.760 --> 01:56:16.410
Bring back everything
that's ever hurt you.

01:56:16.560 --> 01:56:19.643
All the pain you had inside,
everything that held you back.

01:56:19.800 --> 01:56:23.805
Put it in both fists, and I want you
to drive it through his body

01:56:23.960 --> 01:56:26.247
and I promise you, his head will fall.

01:56:26.560 --> 01:56:29.802
We're into the part of the fight where
all your instincts come into play.

01:56:30.040 --> 01:56:34.090
Most experts expected that Conlan
would avoid trading shots with Creed

01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:36.323
but he's trading willingly.

01:56:36.480 --> 01:56:37.925
Creed fires a hard body punch.

01:56:38.080 --> 01:56:39.491
Conlan in trouble!

01:56:39.960 --> 01:56:41.644
- Hard left hand to the body.
- Oh, yeah!

01:56:42.400 --> 01:56:44.129
The champ is in bad shape, Jim.

01:56:44.280 --> 01:56:46.248
Creed realized he has a better chance

01:56:46.400 --> 01:56:48.607
of hurting Conlan to the
body than to the head!

01:56:49.640 --> 01:56:50.687
- What an uppercut!
- No!

01:56:51.640 --> 01:56:53.369
And Creed staggers back.

01:56:53.680 --> 01:56:54.681
Body! Body!

01:56:55.520 --> 01:56:57.363
To the body, trading shots!

01:56:57.520 --> 01:56:59.761
Pawing with his jab,
Creed looks to land one big shot.

01:56:59.920 --> 01:57:01.285
Move your legs!

01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:29.126
Donnie, get up!

01:57:31.200 --> 01:57:32.361
Get up, D!

01:57:34.200 --> 01:57:35.201
Come on, baby.

01:57:43.040 --> 01:57:44.246
Stitch!

01:57:51.840 --> 01:57:53.410
Creed just got up

01:57:53.560 --> 01:57:54.721
- like a man possessed.
- You okay? Look at me!

01:57:54.920 --> 01:57:56.001
- He was out!
- Donnie!

01:57:56.160 --> 01:57:58.686
Down but not out. Conlan thinks
he's celebrating a knockout.

01:57:58.960 --> 01:58:00.325
Get down! He's getting up!

01:58:00.480 --> 01:58:02.482
But the referee is dusting Creed's gloves.

01:58:02.640 --> 01:58:03.721
You're good.

01:58:03.880 --> 01:58:07.282
Creed beats the count
and the action begins again.

01:58:07.440 --> 01:58:08.885
That's the heart of a champion.

01:58:09.040 --> 01:58:10.644
He has his daddy's heart,
I'll tell you that much.

01:58:10.880 --> 01:58:12.006
Donnie, be ready!

01:58:12.160 --> 01:58:15.209
More work to do for Conlan.
Body shot. Body shot.

01:58:15.400 --> 01:58:17.050
Trying to set Creed up one more time.

01:58:17.200 --> 01:58:18.565
Tie him up, for Christ's sake!

01:58:21.880 --> 01:58:24.531
Stitch has done a great job
over that right eye

01:58:24.680 --> 01:58:26.887
but now the left eye
looks like it's almost shut.

01:58:27.040 --> 01:58:28.246
Closing up.

01:58:28.880 --> 01:58:30.291
- Rock, is he okay?
- You have to go back to...

01:58:30.440 --> 01:58:31.851
Stay there, Bianca, it's okay.

01:58:32.040 --> 01:58:33.690
I'm cool, man, I'm cool!

01:58:34.120 --> 01:58:35.201
I'm good.

01:58:35.360 --> 01:58:36.361
- You're good?
- Yeah, man, all right?

01:58:36.520 --> 01:58:37.601
- You sure about that?
- I am. I'm good.

01:58:37.760 --> 01:58:40.206
He's taken a lot of punishment
to both the body and the head.

01:58:40.360 --> 01:58:41.930
Left eye completely closed.

01:58:42.080 --> 01:58:43.366
- I'm gonna stop this thing.
- No!

01:58:43.520 --> 01:58:44.885
Let me see the eye.

01:58:45.200 --> 01:58:47.168
Time! Doc, give him a look!

01:58:47.800 --> 01:58:49.723
All right. Show me your eye.

01:58:49.880 --> 01:58:51.564
Show me your eye, Adonis!

01:58:51.720 --> 01:58:53.051
How many fingers?

01:58:53.400 --> 01:58:54.401
How many fingers?

01:58:55.120 --> 01:58:56.281
How many, Adonis?

01:58:56.480 --> 01:58:58.130
- Four.
- And again.

01:58:59.240 --> 01:59:00.401
Two.

01:59:01.120 --> 01:59:02.167
Time in!

01:59:02.400 --> 01:59:03.970
All right. Breathe through your mouth.

01:59:04.120 --> 01:59:06.043
Deep breaths, kid, deep.

01:59:06.240 --> 01:59:07.571
You are up on the cards,
you're winning this.

01:59:07.720 --> 01:59:08.721
You are gonna win this!

01:59:08.880 --> 01:59:10.405
But just keep smart
and keep away from him.

01:59:10.560 --> 01:59:12.722
He's going to sleep this time.
He's going out this round.

01:59:12.880 --> 01:59:14.245
I should've stopped
the fight with your father.

01:59:14.400 --> 01:59:15.606
I'm stopping this one now.

01:59:15.760 --> 01:59:17.410
Don't, okay? Let me finish.

01:59:18.080 --> 01:59:19.923
- I gotta prove it.
- Prove what?

01:59:20.920 --> 01:59:22.160
I'm not a mistake.

01:59:26.560 --> 01:59:28.927
Look at me. I never got a chance
to thank Apollo

01:59:29.080 --> 01:59:31.287
for helping me out after Mickey died.

01:59:31.440 --> 01:59:33.602
But it's nothing compared
to what you've done.

01:59:33.760 --> 01:59:35.250
You taught me how to fight again

01:59:35.400 --> 01:59:37.164
and I'm gonna go home
and I'm gonna fight this thing.

01:59:37.320 --> 01:59:39.288
But if I fight, I want you to fight, too.

01:59:39.480 --> 01:59:41.244
I want you to go across this ring

01:59:41.440 --> 01:59:44.091
and knock that son of a bitch down.
Can you do it?

01:59:44.800 --> 01:59:45.847
Say it.

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:47.525
I'm gonna knock that son of a bitch down.

01:59:47.680 --> 01:59:48.920
I know you are. You know why?

01:59:49.080 --> 01:59:50.923
Because you're a Creed
and I love you, kid.

01:59:51.120 --> 01:59:52.121
- I love you too.
- Go on.

01:59:52.280 --> 01:59:53.520
All right, baby, let's go.

01:59:57.040 --> 01:59:58.451
Go get him, Donnie!

02:00:02.160 --> 02:00:04.003
Round 12 begins.

02:00:04.160 --> 02:00:07.960
Virtually no one outside of Adonis Creed's
family and group of friends

02:00:08.120 --> 02:00:09.884
would ever have expected to see him

02:00:10.040 --> 02:00:12.646
in a 12th round against
"Pretty" Ricky Conlan

02:00:12.800 --> 02:00:15.167
and trading shots as they come
to these last three minutes.

02:00:16.720 --> 02:00:18.643
And there's a hard left hook upstairs.

02:00:19.120 --> 02:00:20.121
Yeah!

02:00:20.480 --> 02:00:22.960
Every time you wanna say
it's the beginning of the end

02:00:23.120 --> 02:00:26.488
the other guy comes through
with a shot you can't believe.

02:00:27.120 --> 02:00:28.531
Hard right hand by Conlan.

02:00:28.680 --> 02:00:30.045
Come on! Don't sit there!

02:00:30.720 --> 02:00:34.247
They're trading shots in the kind
of back and forth action

02:00:34.520 --> 02:00:37.000
that most of us didn't expect to see.

02:00:39.200 --> 02:00:42.880
Creed getting hit with some hard shots
but landing some of his own,

02:00:43.040 --> 02:00:44.724
and Adonis is firing back!

02:00:45.200 --> 02:00:47.043
Another pitched battle
between the two warriors.

02:00:47.200 --> 02:00:49.009
- Ricky, nail him!
- Come on, kid!

02:00:51.160 --> 02:00:53.367
Creed spins, puts the champ in the corner!

02:00:53.520 --> 02:00:54.681
Body! Body!

02:00:55.200 --> 02:00:57.851
Throwing body shots
like he's Rocky Balboa!

02:00:58.160 --> 02:01:00.242
Going upstairs like he's Apollo Creed!

02:01:00.440 --> 02:01:01.521
Knock his ass out!

02:01:01.680 --> 02:01:03.523
Closing seconds of the fight!

02:01:04.040 --> 02:01:05.087
Ricky!

02:01:06.560 --> 02:01:07.561
That's what I'm talking about!

02:01:08.080 --> 02:01:09.525
Conlan is down!

02:01:09.680 --> 02:01:13.082
That is the first time in his career
he's been on the canvas.

02:01:13.280 --> 02:01:16.921
You cannot be saved by the bell
in the 12th and final round.

02:01:17.600 --> 02:01:19.284
- Ricky, get up!
- Stay down!

02:01:19.440 --> 02:01:21.044
- Stay down!
- Six!

02:01:21.200 --> 02:01:22.690
- Dramatic count in Liverpool.
- Seven! Eight!

02:01:22.840 --> 02:01:25.047
He must get up to preserve
his chance to win the fight.

02:01:25.200 --> 02:01:26.201
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay.

02:01:26.360 --> 02:01:27.521
- Look at me!
- I'm all right!

02:01:27.680 --> 02:01:28.681
- He's up!
- What?

02:01:28.880 --> 02:01:32.202
The bell sounds, so Conlan
survives the 12th round!

02:01:32.360 --> 02:01:33.805
What a finish!

02:01:33.960 --> 02:01:37.362
If that round goes another 30 seconds,
we may have a new champion.

02:01:37.560 --> 02:01:40.723
An unforgettable fight
on an unforgettable night!

02:01:40.880 --> 02:01:43.531
He's no longer just the namesake
of Apollo Creed,

02:01:43.680 --> 02:01:45.409
he's the living embodiment.

02:01:45.560 --> 02:01:46.561
Ladies and gentlemen,

02:01:46.720 --> 02:01:50.725
a round of applause for
these two warriors in the ring!

02:01:51.720 --> 02:01:54.041
To the winner by split decision

02:01:56.160 --> 02:01:58.970
and still the undefeated
champion of the world...

02:01:59.160 --> 02:02:00.571
You did great, kid.

02:02:00.720 --> 02:02:02.290
"Pretty" Ricky Conlan!

02:02:02.440 --> 02:02:03.566
Donnie, you were robbed.

02:02:03.720 --> 02:02:06.291
If this fight had been
10 seconds longer...

02:02:06.560 --> 02:02:07.846
10 seconds longer...

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:09.001
Creed.

02:02:12.920 --> 02:02:14.251
You go and get it, chum.

02:02:14.400 --> 02:02:15.765
You the future of this division.

02:02:15.920 --> 02:02:17.285
You wear that name with pride.

02:02:17.760 --> 02:02:18.921
Respect.

02:02:19.680 --> 02:02:22.570
Congratulations, Adonis,
on a sensational effort.

02:02:22.760 --> 02:02:25.604
I just wanna thank my mom.
She's at home. I love you.

02:02:25.760 --> 02:02:27.250
Even though I know she's
mad at me for doing this.

02:02:27.480 --> 02:02:28.925
Hopefully I made her proud.

02:02:29.080 --> 02:02:31.606
You almost gave me a heart
attack but I'm proud of you.

02:02:31.760 --> 02:02:32.921
I got my family right here.

02:02:33.080 --> 02:02:35.082
Without them,
none of this would've been possible.

02:02:36.320 --> 02:02:40.211
Rocky, Apollo Creed's son
looks at you and says family.

02:02:40.360 --> 02:02:41.361
What does that mean to you?

02:02:41.520 --> 02:02:44.603
It means I'm a lucky guy.
What can I say, right, kid?

02:02:44.960 --> 02:02:48.965
He's a real fighter,
and he's helping me fight a few things,

02:02:49.120 --> 02:02:50.884
so I appreciate it. I really do.

02:02:51.520 --> 02:02:54.364
Adonis, I know you never met your father.

02:02:54.520 --> 02:02:57.126
But if he was here tonight,
what would you wanna say to him?

02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:03.601
I'll just tell him that I love him

02:03:04.280 --> 02:03:06.647
and I know he didn't leave me on purpose.

02:03:07.480 --> 02:03:10.484
And I'm proud to be a Creed.

02:03:12.480 --> 02:03:16.690
Thanks, Adonis, and congratulations
on a sensational performance. Jim.

02:03:16.880 --> 02:03:20.168
Creed! Creed! Creed!

02:03:24.400 --> 02:03:25.401
Go on.

02:03:25.800 --> 02:03:28.167
Talk to them. Go on!

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.162
This crowd is up on its feet.

02:03:52.360 --> 02:03:54.362
No one wants to leave the arena.

02:03:54.520 --> 02:03:57.649
Everyone in here knows
they've seen something special.

02:03:57.800 --> 02:03:59.404
A fight they'll never forget.

02:03:59.760 --> 02:04:01.888
Ricky Conlan wins the fight.

02:04:02.080 --> 02:04:04.606
Adonis Creed wins the night.

02:04:24.720 --> 02:04:26.051
This is it?

02:04:26.920 --> 02:04:27.967
Yeah.

02:04:31.840 --> 02:04:34.047
I just wanna see
if I can get up these steps.

02:04:34.480 --> 02:04:35.891
When's the first time you came here?

02:04:36.160 --> 02:04:37.730
I was 12.

02:04:39.080 --> 02:04:41.560
I think it's my favorite place.

02:04:47.400 --> 02:04:49.289
When you get to the top

02:04:50.560 --> 02:04:52.244
you think you can fly.

02:05:10.920 --> 02:05:12.251
Almost there.

02:05:13.240 --> 02:05:14.765
You got this.

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:23.286
Come on, young man.

02:05:23.440 --> 02:05:24.521
Just let me catch my breath.

02:05:24.680 --> 02:05:26.682
Come on, no breaks. We rest at the top.

02:05:26.840 --> 02:05:28.205
Just a minute.

02:05:28.760 --> 02:05:30.683
Nah, this is what you asked for, right?

02:05:30.840 --> 02:05:32.763
Let's go. One step at a time.

02:05:34.160 --> 02:05:35.366
Yeah.

02:05:36.680 --> 02:05:37.886
Come on.

02:05:39.880 --> 02:05:43.362
One step at a time. Who told you that?

02:05:43.800 --> 02:05:44.961
Some old guy.

02:05:45.120 --> 02:05:47.566
You know I meant that for you, not for me.

02:05:50.640 --> 02:05:53.484
I think they added a few more steps.

02:05:53.880 --> 02:05:56.360
- I don't know.
- Almost there.

02:05:56.520 --> 02:05:57.965
I'm gonna take these last two.

02:05:58.120 --> 02:05:59.690
One more step.

02:05:59.880 --> 02:06:00.927
How you feeling?

02:06:01.120 --> 02:06:03.646
Oh, good. Really good.

02:06:09.480 --> 02:06:10.641
You all right there, old man?

02:06:10.800 --> 02:06:12.006
Yeah.

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:14.490
Nice view.

02:06:18.640 --> 02:06:22.645
If you look hard enough,
you can see your whole life from up here.

02:06:22.840 --> 02:06:24.330
How does it look?

02:06:24.480 --> 02:06:27.848
Not bad at all. And you?

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:29.684
Not bad at all.

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.321
You see this guy here staring back at you?

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:58.684
That's your toughest opponent.

02:12:00.360 --> 02:12:03.924
Every time you get into the ring,
that's who you're going against.

02:12:04.760 --> 02:12:08.762
I believe that in boxing
and I do believe that in life, okay?

02:12:10.680 --> 02:12:12.409
Nobody showed me how to do this.

02:12:12.560 --> 02:12:13.846
I'm ready.
