00:01.460 --> 00:03.098
Previously on Unforgettable...

00:03.130 --> 00:06.099
MURRAY:
They're called Alpha Five--
covert paramilitary unit

00:06.140 --> 00:07.630
from _the former
Sovret Union.

00:07.670 --> 00:10.230
Jacqueline Mikhailova--
goes by Jackie M.

00:10.270 --> 00:11.407
MURRAY:
Interpol considers her
a person of interest

00:11.440 --> 00:14.739
in eight assassinations
in the last two years alone.

00:14.780 --> 00:16.998
That's her, that's her,
that's her. Hey, hey!

00:20.620 --> 00:22.440
He was poisoned
using Tomexide.

00:22.490 --> 00:23.787
See the injection site?

00:23.820 --> 00:26.186
I'd like to thank you all
for the...

00:27.860 --> 00:29.054
Drop your weapon.

00:29.730 --> 00:31.220
No.

00:31.260 --> 00:32.591
She's dead.

00:32.630 --> 00:33.756
AL:
We found the ambulance.

00:33.800 --> 00:34.824
No trace of Jackie.

00:34.860 --> 00:36.794
Al, we can't
just let her go.

00:43.810 --> 00:46.529
You're all squared away.

00:46.580 --> 00:48.400
Oh, good.

00:48.440 --> 00:49.805
I'm exhausted.

00:49.850 --> 00:51.738
Think you'll manage
not to kick the covers off

00:51.780 --> 00:53.338
five minutes
after I'm gone?

00:53.380 --> 00:55.473
Then I wouldn't get to
listen to you complain.

00:55.520 --> 00:57.647
It'll be somebody else's
problem.

00:57.690 --> 00:58.645
I'm off duty.

00:58.690 --> 01:00.817
Try not to drive the next
nurse crazy, will you?

01:00.860 --> 01:03.749
You know I only like
to drive you crazy.

01:03.790 --> 01:07.157
WOMAN :
Dr. Lambert to Oncology,
Dr. Lambert to Oncology.

01:14.540 --> 01:16.531
Miss me already?

01:28.920 --> 01:30.888
MAN:
Aw, that's, like, a
hundred bucks I lost.

01:30.920 --> 01:32.751
MAN 2:
Try agaIn-- you can't
win all the time, man.

01:32.790 --> 01:33.711
Find the lady if you can.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.512
One in three, one in three,
be all you can be.

01:35.560 --> 01:37.187
Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about.

01:37.230 --> 01:38.822
I'm, like, two feet
away from you...
You got it?

01:38.860 --> 01:39.656
Aah!

01:39.700 --> 01:41.895
Almost, my man, almost,
that was good.

01:41.930 --> 01:43.329
PLAYER:
I'm all tapped out, man.

01:43.370 --> 01:44.325
DEALER:
It's not bad, though.

01:44.370 --> 01:46.463
Hey, I'll take a shot.

01:46.500 --> 01:47.467
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

01:47.500 --> 01:49.434
All right, place your bet.

01:49.470 --> 01:50.664
All right, $20.

01:50.710 --> 01:52.803
$20-- I'll take that.

01:52.840 --> 01:54.603
Find the lady if you can.

01:54.640 --> 01:57.143
One in three, one in three,
be all you can be.

02:00.280 --> 02:01.542
Aah!

02:01.580 --> 02:03.218
Hey, I won
the first one, too.
Wow.

02:03.250 --> 02:04.217
You want to go again?

02:04.250 --> 02:05.342
Again?
Yeah.

02:05.390 --> 02:06.709
I don't know, I...
Come on, come on.

02:06.760 --> 02:08.819
Double or nothing.
All right.

02:08.860 --> 02:11.522
All right, you know what?
I'm feeling luclq today.
Why don't we triple it?

02:11.560 --> 02:13.152
MAN:
Careful, lady.
That's what I'm talking about.

02:13.200 --> 02:14.189
Second time, you're
not gonna win.

02:14.230 --> 02:15.390
CARRIE:
All right, here we go.

02:15.430 --> 02:16.397
Let's see,
let's see, all right.

02:16.430 --> 02:17.567
Find the lady if you can.

02:17.600 --> 02:18.862
Too fast.
One in three, one in three,

02:18.900 --> 02:20.162
be all you can be.
Watch those hands.

02:21.200 --> 02:23.236
Find the lady

02:34.320 --> 02:36.208
You sure of that one?

02:36.250 --> 02:37.239
Yeah.

02:42.630 --> 02:43.688
Game's over, lady.

02:43.730 --> 02:44.754
Game's o...?

02:44.790 --> 02:45.927
Game's over.
The game IS over.

02:46.960 --> 02:49.690
How about that?

02:51.900 --> 02:54.266
Have a nice day.

02:54.300 --> 02:55.858
Yeah, you, too.
Here you go, boys,
don't spend it

02:55.900 --> 02:56.867
all at once.
Hey, thanks, lady.

02:56.910 --> 02:58.730
Hey.

02:58.770 --> 03:00.579
Hey, Carrie,
I might have something.

03:00.610 --> 03:01.872
It's about her.

03:01.910 --> 03:03.707
I'm sending it to you now.

03:03.750 --> 03:04.648
Got this footage from a camera

03:04.680 --> 03:06.739
outside Eastside Hospital
12 minutes ago.

03:06.780 --> 03:08.919
Looks like she was
on her way in.

03:10.490 --> 03:12.355
Can you enhance it?

03:12.390 --> 03:14.255
It is enhanced.

03:14.290 --> 03:15.814
How close is this one?

03:15.860 --> 03:18.658
Any facial recognition match
over 25% triggers my alert.

03:18.690 --> 03:20.555
This one shows a 42% match--

03:20.600 --> 03:21.794
highest one yet.

03:21.830 --> 03:24.765
Eastside Hospital--
I'll head over.

03:24.800 --> 03:25.789
Are you sure?

03:25.830 --> 03:27.695
No disrespect to your
trolling software, Jay,

03:27.740 --> 03:29.958
but the last, what,
ten times it's nothing.

03:30.010 --> 03:31.307
Nine times.

03:31.340 --> 03:32.807
And listen,
it's East 63rd Street,

03:32.840 --> 03:33.602
I'm five minutes from there.

03:33.640 --> 03:35.005
All right,
I'll cover with Eliot.

03:35.040 --> 03:36.007
Be careful.

03:36.040 --> 03:36.870
Jay,

03:36.910 --> 03:39.515
have Jo meet me
at the hospital, okay?

03:39.550 --> 03:41.245
Copy that.

03:42.290 --> 03:44.246
Ah, Detective Wells.

03:44.290 --> 03:47.316
Bob Conti. I'm chief of staff
here at the hospital.

03:47.360 --> 03:49.783
Yeah, this is...
And Joanne Webster,
to what do we owe the honor?

03:49.830 --> 03:51.024
I'm sorry, do
I know you?

03:51.060 --> 03:52.027
I took your class

03:52.060 --> 03:53.789
at Fordham.

03:53.830 --> 03:55.252
Oh, Forensic Pathology.

03:55.300 --> 03:56.927
No, Knitting to
Reduce Stress.

03:56.970 --> 03:58.619
It was a summer
elective.

03:58.670 --> 04:00.433
I still have
those alpaca slippers I made.

04:00.470 --> 04:01.892
Softest darn things.

04:01.940 --> 04:02.702
Aren't they soft?
So...

04:02.740 --> 04:04.605
It's like kitties
on your feet.

04:04.640 --> 04:06.335
Oh, wow, that...

04:06.380 --> 04:07.438
So, Jo...

04:07.480 --> 04:08.299
Dr. Conti,

04:08.340 --> 04:09.876
do you have a list
of people who died

04:09.910 --> 04:11.844
here in, say,
the past two hours?

04:11.880 --> 04:13.575
Of course.

04:13.620 --> 04:15.679
What exactly
are you looking for?

04:15.720 --> 04:17.347
I'm not sure yet.

04:17.390 --> 04:18.948
Here we go.

04:18.990 --> 04:20.059
A gangbanger came in

04:20.090 --> 04:21.955
with a gunshot wound to
the head three hours ago,

04:21.990 --> 04:23.821
died in the ER.

04:23.860 --> 04:27.853
Construction worker fell from
four stories up, and, uh...

04:27.900 --> 04:28.696
Well, that's unfortunate.

04:28.730 --> 04:31.528
54-year-old man,
liver disease, seizure

04:31.570 --> 04:32.559
just 15 minutes ago.

04:32.600 --> 04:33.965
15 minutes ago?

04:34.000 --> 04:35.968
That's the one.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.399
CONTI:
Theodore Muscat.
We're trying

04:37.440 --> 04:38.634
_to locate_ _ _
the family for notification.

04:38.670 --> 04:40.501
The body should be
moved momentarily.

04:43.110 --> 04:45.078
He was being treated for
cavernous hemangioma.

04:45.110 --> 04:46.975
Nurse picked up an alarm,

04:47.020 --> 04:49.079
he'd coded by the time
she got in the room.

04:49.120 --> 04:51.441
Jo, check for an
injection site.

04:51.490 --> 04:52.809
I-I don't
understand.

04:52.860 --> 04:55.055
I don't think there is one,

04:55.090 --> 04:57.979
but, Carrie, this man's
trachea has been crushed.

04:58.030 --> 04:59.520
CONTI:
These types of seizures
can be violent.

04:59.560 --> 05:01.027
Not this violent.

05:01.060 --> 05:02.049
The cartilage
is flattened.

05:02.100 --> 05:03.362
It's ready for you now.

05:03.400 --> 05:04.424
Okay.

05:04.470 --> 05:07.030
You asked to see the
security video from the ward.

05:07.070 --> 05:08.867
It's up on the computer
on the nurses' station.

05:08.900 --> 05:10.060
Great.
Yeah.

05:10.110 --> 05:12.738
CARRIE:
Okay, where are you?

05:14.410 --> 05:16.878
Show me your face, come on.

05:16.910 --> 05:19.447
Look up, look up, look up.

05:26.790 --> 05:29.452
I was hoping
never to see you again.

05:29.490 --> 05:30.855
Likewise.

05:31.130 --> 05:33.018
Jackie.

05:33.060 --> 05:35.756
She's back.

05:51.650 --> 05:53.675
Why would Jackie risk
coming back into the country

05:53.720 --> 05:55.039
to kill a high school
science teacher?

05:55.080 --> 05:56.911
I wanted to kill my
high school science teacher.

05:56.950 --> 05:58.747
He gave me a "D"
in tenth grade.

05:58.790 --> 06:00.382
I had to go to
summer school.

06:00.420 --> 06:01.853
Jay, what do we
got on our victim?

06:01.890 --> 06:04.381
Theodore Muscat.
Lived in Mamaroneck.

06:04.430 --> 06:06.694
Been teaching at Lakeside High
for the past three years,

06:06.730 --> 06:07.651
before that at
a high school

06:07.700 --> 06:08.519
in Ohio
for 12 years.

06:08.560 --> 06:10.494
Not married, no record,
nothing unusual.

06:10.530 --> 06:11.929
There has got to be
some connection here.

06:11.970 --> 06:12.994
AL:
Did you cross him

06:13.040 --> 06:15.691
with what we know
of past Alpha Five operations?

06:15.740 --> 06:17.605
There's nothing.

06:17.640 --> 06:20.131
Now, we know that Alpha Five
was created by KGB officers

06:20.180 --> 06:21.875
to be an elite
paramilitary group

06:21.910 --> 06:24.401
and that they secretly
train in the Caucasus.

06:24.450 --> 06:25.678
So far I see nothing
that links Muscat

06:25.710 --> 06:27.712
to any past Alpha Five
terrorist activity.

06:27.750 --> 06:29.615
Jackie kills anyone
who gets in her way.

06:29.650 --> 06:31.618
Maybe Muscat's death
was collateral damage

06:31.650 --> 06:32.981
on her way
to something else?

06:33.020 --> 06:35.989
The question is,
on her way to what?

06:39.760 --> 06:41.648
Ted was one of our
most popular teachers

06:41.700 --> 06:45.067
with the faculty and
with his students.

06:45.100 --> 06:47.159
Any problems outside of work
that you know of?

06:47.200 --> 06:50.533
The school was pretty
much everything to him.

06:50.570 --> 06:54.734
He was at all the plays,
dances, graduation.

06:54.780 --> 06:56.748
Didn't talk much
about his personal life.

06:56.780 --> 06:58.008
Were you aware
ofanyone

06:58.050 --> 06:59.472
who might have
wanted to hurt him?

06:59.520 --> 07:01.147
N-No, but I-I don't understand.

07:01.180 --> 07:04.479
He was sick;
I thought that's how he died.

07:04.520 --> 07:05.509
Did something happen?

07:05.550 --> 07:09.156
We can't say any
more than that.

07:09.190 --> 07:11.829
JAY: ...that they secretly train
in the Caucasus.

07:13.760 --> 07:15.819
CARRIE:
Di-Did he ever say

07:15.860 --> 07:18.522
where he grew up,
where he was from?

07:18.570 --> 07:20.663
I think the Midwest, he said.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.871
What are these?

07:28.910 --> 07:31.470
Oh, uh, Ted really led the way

07:31.510 --> 07:33.046
with the whole _
paperless classroom thing.

07:33.080 --> 07:37.619
He had his kids hand in all
their work on those USB sticks.

07:44.060 --> 07:45.550
Back in his hospital room,

07:45.590 --> 07:47.228
Ted Muscat had a USB cap

07:47.260 --> 07:49.023
that was missing
its flash drive.

07:49.060 --> 07:52.894
In his room there was a poster
of a valley below Mount El'brus.

07:52.940 --> 07:54.737
That is where the Alpha Five
training camp is.

07:54.770 --> 07:56.761
An Alpha Five agent
was working

07:56.810 --> 07:58.038
as a public school teacher
in Mamaroneck?

07:58.070 --> 08:00.607
I know, I know
it sounds crazy,

08:00.640 --> 08:05.577
but maybe, just maybe he's
more than a science teacher.

08:05.610 --> 08:06.611
Carrie was right.

08:06.650 --> 08:08.117
Ted Muscat, aka

08:08.150 --> 08:10.209
Yevgeny Vayzer,
Alpha Five through and through.

08:10.250 --> 08:11.740
Suspected
in at least seven bombings

08:11.790 --> 08:15.749
throughout Europe from 1995
to 2009, including

08:15.790 --> 08:18.884
the Deutschland Bank attack,
which killed 170 people.

08:18.930 --> 08:19.897
I'd hate to _have detention
in his class.

08:19.930 --> 08:22.251
The whole world must be looking
for this guy.

08:22.300 --> 08:26.589
They were-- until he died
three years ago.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.790
Vayzer was on a G4
that went down

08:28.840 --> 08:30.899
off the coast of Majorca
in 2010.

08:30.940 --> 08:31.929
No survivors.

08:31.970 --> 08:32.937
Turns out,
the three other

08:32.980 --> 08:36.905
passengers were all top
Alpha Five operatives.

08:36.950 --> 08:38.599
All of 'em reported dead.

08:38.650 --> 08:41.744
Petra Kekilli,
Sergei Kirsakov,

08:41.780 --> 08:45.079
and some guy I can only identify
right now as Victor.

08:45.120 --> 08:45.984
I'm looking into
all of 'em.

08:46.020 --> 08:47.954
2010-- that corresponds
with the start

08:47.990 --> 08:49.981
of Muscat's teaching
career in Mamaroneck.

08:50.030 --> 08:52.157
I may have had some luck with
our schoolteacher's phones.

08:52.190 --> 08:53.896
I traced four calls
in two days

08:53.930 --> 08:54.897
from his school office

08:54.930 --> 08:58.093
to the Upper West Side
town house of this guy--

08:58.130 --> 08:59.631
Jimmy Cerrano.

08:59.670 --> 09:00.830
Guy's a hedge
fund manager

09:00.870 --> 09:02.599
worth a couple
hundred million.

09:02.640 --> 09:03.664
Looks like the Feds
have been sniffing

09:03.710 --> 09:04.699
around him for a decade.

09:04.740 --> 09:07.709
Suspected money laundering
for illegal arms deals.

09:07.740 --> 09:08.934
If Alpha Five
is up to something,

09:08.980 --> 09:10.777
they'll need financing
from someone

09:10.810 --> 09:12.675
who knows how to_move
money around qUIetly.

09:12.720 --> 09:13.709
JAY:
You know, the Feds
might already have

09:13.750 --> 09:15.843
an existing search warrant
on Cerrano's place.

09:15.880 --> 09:17.780
I'll see if maybe
we can go piggyback.

09:17.820 --> 09:19.310
All right.

09:25.860 --> 09:27.828
How are things going?

09:27.860 --> 09:29.896
Uh, well, I'm just trying
to connect the dots.

09:29.930 --> 09:31.898
Problem is, you have to actually
be able to see the dots

09:31.930 --> 09:33.739
before you can connect them.

09:33.770 --> 09:35.328
But you think
it's your girl?

09:35.370 --> 09:38.259
Well, we have her on the video
outside the hospital.

09:38.310 --> 09:40.175
The guy she killed
was Alpha Five.

09:40.210 --> 09:41.234
Yeah, I'm sure she's our girl.

09:41.280 --> 09:44.078
Any idea why she'd want
to off a member of her team?

09:44.110 --> 09:46.078
Okay, you're doing
that thing again.

09:46.110 --> 09:48.078
What, the ear
No,

09:48.120 --> 09:49.678
the dancing-around-
what-you-really-want-to-say-

09:49.720 --> 09:51.210
by-asking-obvious—questions
thing.

09:51.250 --> 09:52.217
I do.

09:52.250 --> 09:53.148
I do want to say,

09:53.190 --> 09:54.987
Jackie is a deadly
international assassin

09:55.020 --> 09:57.659
and we should probably bring
the Feds in on this one.

09:57.690 --> 09:58.725
No.

09:58.760 --> 10:00.990
I know how she thinks,
I can get inside her head.

10:01.030 --> 10:02.861
And she can get inside yours.
Don't be so sure.

10:02.900 --> 10:04.822
It's like a
maze up there.
Carrie.

10:04.870 --> 10:06.394
Mm
If we stick
with this,

10:06.430 --> 10:07.590
I need to know I'm
not being dragged

10:07.640 --> 10:11.030
into some personal grudge
match between the two of you.

10:11.070 --> 10:13.072
Neven

10:15.910 --> 10:18.071
Let me guess.

10:18.110 --> 10:20.772
He's worried your personal
stake in catching Jackie

10:20.820 --> 10:22.981
is going to compromise
your professional judgment.

10:23.020 --> 10:25.238
Why does everyone keep using
the word "personal" here?

10:25.290 --> 10:26.245
I am a cop.

10:26.290 --> 10:27.712
We catch bad guys.

10:27.760 --> 10:28.715
That is what we do.

10:28.760 --> 10:29.852
That is what I'm doing.

10:29.890 --> 10:31.858
I beat you at tennis
a long time ago.

10:31.890 --> 10:33.255
You still can't let it go.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.655
August 2001-- you said that
ball was out when it was in.

10:35.700 --> 10:37.429
And what the hell does that
have to do with anything?

10:37.470 --> 10:39.028
Jackie kills six people

10:39.070 --> 10:39.889
and then
outsmarts you

10:39.940 --> 10:41.737
and disappears
right under your nose.

10:41.770 --> 10:44.409
She won, you lost,
it's personal.

10:44.440 --> 10:47.375
Listen, I said I was going
to take her Russian ass down,

10:47.410 --> 10:50.049
okay, when she, she got
away from me the last time,

10:50.080 --> 10:51.672
and that is what
I intend to do.

10:51.710 --> 10:53.712
You know,
she got away from me, too,

10:53.750 --> 10:54.978
which is why
we're gonna

10:55.020 --> 10:58.046
take her down together.

10:58.090 --> 11:00.957
Okay.

11:00.990 --> 11:02.958
I like the sound of that.

11:02.990 --> 11:04.981
Ball was out.

11:05.990 --> 11:08.959
It was in.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.467
CERRANO:
You know, you guys are
really unbelievable.

11:10.500 --> 11:11.899
I mean, this is
the fourth search

11:11.930 --> 11:13.033
in three months.

11:13.070 --> 11:14.332
Maybe tell me
what you're looking for,

11:14.370 --> 11:15.769
and, and I can go get it.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.404
You've been investigated
for money laundering,

11:17.440 --> 11:19.908
insider trading...
Investigated and cleared.

11:19.940 --> 11:21.032
And investigated
and cleared again.

11:21.080 --> 11:22.479
Listen, we're not
with the IRS.

11:22.510 --> 11:23.943
We're not with the SEC.

11:23.980 --> 11:24.844
We're with Major Crimes.

11:24.880 --> 11:26.916
We're investigating
a homicide, a murder.

11:26.950 --> 11:28.918
A what?
And we've got several calls

11:28.950 --> 11:30.918
to your private office
from our victim.

11:30.950 --> 11:31.848
Oh, my God, who was it?

11:31.890 --> 11:34.017
Ted Muscat, science teacher
from Mamaroneck.

11:34.060 --> 11:36.016
You know him?
No, I've never heard of him.

11:36.060 --> 11:37.049
Neither have I.

11:37.090 --> 11:38.227
What about Yevgeny Vayzer?

11:38.260 --> 11:39.852
No idea why he'd be calling you?

11:39.900 --> 11:41.390
No, maybe he got
the wrong number.

11:41.430 --> 11:43.159
Does anyone else have access
to your office phone?

11:43.200 --> 11:44.997
No. I mean, my wife and I,
and Estelle.

11:45.030 --> 11:47.089
Estelle?
Our nanny.

11:47.140 --> 11:48.937
Is she here?
Can I talk to her?
No, she just left.

11:48.970 --> 11:50.767
She took our daughters
to the park. I don't understand.

11:50.810 --> 11:51.765
Do you have a picture of her?

11:51.810 --> 11:52.834
Yeah, I think so.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.939
Yeah.

11:54.980 --> 11:56.436
Sure, here.

11:56.480 --> 12:00.018
This is from when, uh,
we took the kids to Maui.

12:04.390 --> 12:06.449
JAY:
Petra Kekilli.

12:06.490 --> 12:08.811
Where's the park?

12:10.360 --> 12:11.850
No, we can't go back

12:11.890 --> 12:13.357
to the ice cream truck again.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.129
Your mom will kill me.

12:15.160 --> 12:18.823
It's not her mother I would
worry about if I were you.

12:18.870 --> 12:20.462
I want you to go play
over by the swing set.

12:20.500 --> 12:22.468
The one with the ladybugs.

12:22.500 --> 12:24.536
Stay there,
don't come back over here

12:24.570 --> 12:26.367
until I come and get you,
do you understand?

12:26.410 --> 12:28.401
Okay.

12:32.820 --> 12:34.845
You look good for a ghost.

12:34.880 --> 12:36.939
You shouldn't have come, Jackie.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.844
Hmm.

12:38.890 --> 12:40.118
I'd rather do this the easy way.

12:40.160 --> 12:44.028
Let you join those girls
on the ladybug swing.

12:44.060 --> 12:45.288
Where is he, Petra?

12:45.330 --> 12:47.355
You know I can't tell you.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.960
I'm sure you've heard
about Yevgeny?

12:50.000 --> 12:51.490
He was sick.

12:51.530 --> 12:52.895
And weak.

13:12.220 --> 13:14.359
I am not so weak.

13:43.320 --> 13:45.345
All right, get back, step back.

13:45.390 --> 13:47.187
Move back, move back.
Get back, get back.

13:47.220 --> 13:48.983
Out of the way.

13:51.190 --> 13:53.351
How much do you want to
bet Tomexide poisoning?

13:53.400 --> 13:54.355
It's got to be Jackie.

13:54.400 --> 13:56.220
Listen to me, you got
to canvass this park.

13:56.260 --> 13:57.898
Okay? Blonde, white female.

13:57.930 --> 13:59.989
Get it over the air.
Hold all these witnesses.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.133
She was just here. Find her!
MAN: We're on it.

14:02.170 --> 14:03.865
She was their nanny
for three years.

14:03.910 --> 14:06.128
She must've been using Cerrano's
accounts for Alpha Five.

14:06.170 --> 14:07.398
Three years
after she supposedly dies

14:07.440 --> 14:09.203
in a plane crash
just like Vayzer.

14:09.240 --> 14:11.174
We're dealing
with a sleeper cell, Al.

14:11.210 --> 14:13.246
There were two more operatives
on that plane.

14:13.280 --> 14:15.271
We have to find them.

14:42.380 --> 14:43.938
AL:
It's Jay!

14:43.980 --> 14:45.572
We got to get back
to the Cerrano house.

14:49.650 --> 14:53.279
I found these behind the dresser
in the nanny's room.

14:54.320 --> 14:55.252
What are we looking at?

14:55.290 --> 14:57.224
After September 11,
we got special training

14:57.260 --> 14:58.488
to spot this kind of thing.

14:58.530 --> 15:01.294
It's a high-capacity
semiconductor 70VR.

15:01.330 --> 15:03.093
Which means?
It's a type
of electronic fuse.

15:03.130 --> 15:04.222
Really sophisticated.

15:04.270 --> 15:06.261
Our high school science teacher
knew what he was doing.

15:06.300 --> 15:07.961
A fuse for what?

15:08.000 --> 15:10.332
Well, this goes way above my
pay grade, so I can't be sure,

15:10.370 --> 15:12.509
but I recognize
some of the components.

15:14.280 --> 15:16.077
The neutron reflectors
give it away.

15:16.110 --> 15:18.044
A bomb.

15:18.080 --> 15:19.968
A nuclear bomb.

15:25.750 --> 15:28.310
SADM. Special Atomic
Demolition Munition.

15:28.360 --> 15:30.055
Developed by US. military
in the '605

15:30.090 --> 15:31.455
for_ battlefield use
against the Sowets.

15:31.490 --> 15:36.154
Very similar to the legendary
Russian RA-115.

15:36.200 --> 15:37.292
Suitcase nuke?

15:37.330 --> 15:38.592
Little guy packs a big punch.

15:38.630 --> 15:41.030
No one's ever seen one,
except on paper.

15:41.070 --> 15:42.332
And it's really tough to build,

15:42.370 --> 15:43.667
even if you find the materials.

15:43.710 --> 15:45.507
This particular Alpha Five team
could pull it off.

15:45.540 --> 15:47.201
Our mystery man,
Victor,

15:47.240 --> 15:49.731
turns out to be Victor Siancu.

15:49.780 --> 15:52.248
The top Alpha Five
operative in the world.

15:52.280 --> 15:54.145
How much damage
would something like that do?

15:54.180 --> 15:57.047
Well, explosive yield would
be way less than a kiloton.

15:57.090 --> 15:58.614
But, still...

15:58.650 --> 16:00.686
It going off in Manhattan,

16:00.720 --> 16:03.086
radiation and all, I mean,
you're looking at fatalities

16:03.130 --> 16:04.757
in the tens of thousands.
Not to mention

16:04.790 --> 16:06.451
near permanent
contamination...

16:06.490 --> 16:08.094
All right, I've already
looped in the Feds,

16:08.130 --> 16:10.428
but we got to get out there,
all of us, talk to every CI,

16:10.470 --> 16:13.735
anyone you've
ever met who might...
Burns. In my office, now.

16:13.770 --> 16:15.465
All right, get on it.

16:15.500 --> 16:17.331
Yeah.
Let's go.

16:17.370 --> 16:19.702
ELIOT:
Carrie, Lieutenant Burns...

16:19.740 --> 16:21.276
Agents Thorne
and Stone

16:21.310 --> 16:24.245
from the International
Counterterrorism Agency.

16:24.280 --> 16:26.145
We've already notified
Homeland and the FBI.

16:26.180 --> 16:28.375
And they notified us. This is
gonna be a joint operation.

16:28.420 --> 16:29.546
ICA will take the lead.

16:29.580 --> 16:32.140
All right. How
much do you know?

16:32.190 --> 16:34.078
STONE:
Not a hell of a lot more
than you, I imagine.

16:34.120 --> 16:36.281
ICA's been following chatter
about a possible attack

16:36.320 --> 16:37.753
in Manhattan for weeks now,

16:37.790 --> 16:40.122
_ _ but we had no idea _
it involved a nuclear deVIce.

16:40.160 --> 16:42.799
You were right. Victor and his
elite team from Alpha Five

16:42.830 --> 16:45.765
didn't die, merely put to bed.
STONE: As sleeper agents
in the U.S.,

16:45.800 --> 16:48.234
they could wait
for the right assignment.

16:48.270 --> 16:50.158
We think that Jackie_'s
part of the team again.

16:50.210 --> 16:51.734
But she's killing her teammates.

16:51.770 --> 16:54.102
Maybe she's the cleaner,
taking out her teammates

16:54.140 --> 16:56.028
once they've finished
their part of the job.

16:56.080 --> 16:58.378
Wouldn't explain her taking
the USB drive, though, would it?

16:58.410 --> 17:00.275
STONE:
That is a good
point, Detective.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.447
We hope that together
we can find some answers.

17:02.480 --> 17:04.243
Well, we don't we start
by finding

17:04.290 --> 17:06.042
the last member
of Victor's sleeper team.

17:06.090 --> 17:07.489
Fact is, we
already got him.

17:07.520 --> 17:09.078
What?

17:09.120 --> 17:10.428
Wait, in custody?

17:10.460 --> 17:12.087
Not yet, but we're on him.

17:12.130 --> 17:14.826
We're thinking we hold him
out as bait for Jackie,

17:14.860 --> 17:16.828
who leads us to Victor...
ELIOT: Who leads
us to the bomb.

17:16.860 --> 17:18.521
Exactly.

17:18.570 --> 17:19.525
Have a look.

17:19.570 --> 17:22.061
Sergei Kirsakov.
Real charmer.

17:22.100 --> 17:24.068
Changes identities
constantly.

17:24.110 --> 17:26.670
He's the dealmaker,
the face of Alpha Five.

17:26.710 --> 17:28.598
His new identity
is Gordon Purcell,

17:28.640 --> 17:30.369
big import-export guy.

17:30.410 --> 17:33.345
His new identity includes
a blonde wife, one kid,

17:33.380 --> 17:36.213
another on the way
and a house in Irvington.

17:36.250 --> 17:38.241
He leads_
a spotless life.

17:38.290 --> 17:39.518
His one weakness:

17:39.550 --> 17:41.518
pretty, young women.

17:41.560 --> 17:43.221
Once a month,
he takes a suite

17:43.260 --> 17:44.522
at the Rotterdam
on Park Avenue.

17:44.560 --> 17:46.152
Today's the day.

17:46.190 --> 17:47.851
He likes to keep
a low profile,

17:47.900 --> 17:49.549
so he only takes
two bodyguards with him.

17:49.600 --> 17:52.626
THORNE:
That's when Jackie
will make a move.

17:52.670 --> 17:54.763
And that's when
we take her.

17:58.810 --> 18:00.505
Here comes Sergei.

18:00.540 --> 18:01.472
Here we go.

18:12.320 --> 18:13.412
AL:
Target now in lobby.

18:13.460 --> 18:15.314
Do you have eyes on him, Stone?

18:15.360 --> 18:16.554
STONE:
Copy that.

18:16.590 --> 18:18.455
Sergei took a phone call.

18:18.490 --> 18:19.582
Girlfriend's on the way up.

18:23.670 --> 18:25.820
AL:
Target now on the move.

18:39.380 --> 18:42.417
MAN: Team three
reporting, no movement.
Copy that.

18:42.450 --> 18:44.589
She's not just going to
walk into this, okay?

18:44.620 --> 18:46.417
I'm telling you, she's
way smarter than that.

18:46.450 --> 18:48.850
Our people have been over
every inch of the interior.

18:48.890 --> 18:50.721
She's got to come in
from the outside.

19:07.710 --> 19:09.871
Marissa.

19:09.910 --> 19:13.539
Don't use all the hot water.

19:13.580 --> 19:15.810
We're going to be in there
a long time.

19:20.620 --> 19:22.713
Marissa?

19:22.760 --> 19:24.728
Would you like a drink?

19:47.620 --> 19:49.474
Don't think you're
going to have time

19:49.520 --> 19:50.782
for that shower,
Sergei.

19:52.620 --> 19:54.588
Why should he see you?

19:54.620 --> 19:56.258
I have something he wants.

19:56.290 --> 19:58.224
And he has something you want.

19:58.260 --> 20:00.626
But I don't think he's
g0ing to give it to you.

20:05.330 --> 20:07.491
Tell me where Victor is
and I'll let you live.

20:07.540 --> 20:10.407
One-time offer.

20:10.440 --> 20:12.658
Between friends.

20:12.710 --> 20:16.828
You_make the same offer to our
friends Petra and Yevgeny?

20:16.880 --> 20:19.849
They were stupid enough
to fight back.

20:19.880 --> 20:22.872
But you, you're
smarter than that.

20:22.920 --> 20:25.411
You love life.

20:31.960 --> 20:34.656
He only communicates by text.

20:36.660 --> 20:38.366
This is taking
too long.

20:38.400 --> 20:39.662
Easy does it.

20:39.700 --> 20:42.464
CARRIE:
Show me 49th Street.
Side entrance.

20:45.940 --> 20:47.578
Can you zoom in
on that quadrant?

20:56.320 --> 20:58.015
...notification. The body
should be moved momentarily.

20:58.050 --> 21:00.814
He was being treated
for cavernous hemangioma.

21:01.890 --> 21:03.380
That van was
at the hospital.

21:03.430 --> 21:05.352
I saw it leave just
after we got there.

21:05.390 --> 21:06.459
You sure?

21:06.490 --> 21:07.696
Yeah, she's sure.

21:07.730 --> 21:09.391
Target is here.
Repeat, target is here.

21:09.430 --> 21:10.397
She's in the hotel.

21:10.430 --> 21:11.727
But that's impossible.

21:11.770 --> 21:13.965
Let's go.
Get up to that room now.

21:17.810 --> 21:20.529
Team Six, we believe
the target's in the hotel.

21:20.580 --> 21:21.877
Converge on the room.

21:30.720 --> 21:31.687
Carrie.

21:32.790 --> 21:34.485
Go ahead. I'll stay here.

21:42.030 --> 21:44.828
AGENT:
Hold. Clear.

21:44.870 --> 21:46.360
Cover right,
let's go.

21:48.740 --> 21:49.866
AGENT:
Clear.

21:56.680 --> 21:59.569
She was here. Kirsakov's dead.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.752
MAN 1:
You need a cab, sir?
MAN 2: No.

22:16.800 --> 22:17.767
MAN 1: Okay, sir.
Have a nice day.

22:17.800 --> 22:19.620
Can I take your bags?

22:26.040 --> 22:28.508
No.

22:28.540 --> 22:30.804
As I said, preparation.

23:05.610 --> 23:07.419
You're going away a
long time, Jacqueline.

23:07.450 --> 23:08.849
There's nothing anyone
can do about that.

23:08.880 --> 23:10.040
But you're young,

23:10.080 --> 23:12.685
you've got a lot of
years ahead of you,

23:12.720 --> 23:14.859
and right now
can help you determine

23:14.890 --> 23:16.517
the quality of those years.

23:16.560 --> 23:18.858
Does it?

23:18.890 --> 23:21.950
I was thinking of a little condo
down in Boca,

23:22.000 --> 23:23.422
eastern exposure.

23:23.470 --> 23:25.495
Can you make that happen?

23:26.530 --> 23:27.690
Where's that damn bomb?!

23:27.740 --> 23:29.560
STONE:
Look,

23:29.600 --> 23:33.502
we know you took a flash drive
off of Yevgeny Vayzer before

23:33.540 --> 23:34.472
you killed him.

23:34.510 --> 23:35.772
Did I?

23:35.810 --> 23:37.675
Ah. If you say so.

23:37.710 --> 23:39.905
Tell us where it is,
and we can help you.

23:39.950 --> 23:41.770
I don't need
your help.
We know

23:41.820 --> 23:44.038
that Victor's having
you clean his team up.

23:44.090 --> 23:46.741
But did you ever think that soon

23:46.790 --> 23:51.227
you're gonna be the only one
who's left to be cleaned up?

23:54.500 --> 23:58.527
Believe me,
I am not afraid of Victor.

23:58.570 --> 24:00.891
They getting anywhere?

24:00.940 --> 24:03.659
No.
Well, maybe this
will be of interest.

24:03.710 --> 24:06.065
Turns out Russian
Intelligence briefly worked

24:06.110 --> 24:08.670
a mole into Alpha Five
back in '09.

24:08.710 --> 24:10.803
Looks like there was a lot
of internal dissension

24:10.850 --> 24:11.976
over Victor's romantic

24:12.010 --> 24:13.716
_ involvement _
With one of his operatives.

24:13.750 --> 24:15.911
One of his most
effective operatives.

24:15.950 --> 24:17.144
For whatever reason,

24:17.180 --> 24:18.545
this individual wanted
out of Alpha Five,

24:18.590 --> 24:21.889
Victor forced her to stay.
A few months later,

24:21.920 --> 24:24.684
Victor and his team disappeared
in that bogus plane crash.

24:24.730 --> 24:27.995
Believe me,
I am not afraid of Victor.

24:29.030 --> 24:31.225
Thank you, Murray.

24:32.630 --> 24:34.530
Hey.

24:35.600 --> 24:37.500
Would you mind...?

24:37.540 --> 24:38.768
THORNE:
Detective, I believe

24:38.810 --> 24:41.278
we agreed ICA would take
the lead in this case.

24:41.310 --> 24:43.870
Yes, we did, but, um...

24:43.910 --> 24:46.606
well, Jackie and I
have an understanding.

24:46.650 --> 24:48.675
Ten minutes?

24:50.280 --> 24:52.282
Fine.

24:52.320 --> 24:53.241
Thank you.

24:53.290 --> 24:54.848
I wish you luck.

24:54.890 --> 24:56.653
Oh, well, I appreciate that.

24:56.690 --> 24:58.783
Thank you.

25:02.030 --> 25:03.998
Last time I saw you,

25:04.030 --> 25:05.998
you were dead.

25:06.030 --> 25:07.964
Mmm, briefly, yes.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.605
Yeah. Not long enough.

25:10.640 --> 25:13.268
Actually, I found oblivion...
rather pleasant.

25:13.310 --> 25:14.834
Oh, well,

25:14.880 --> 25:16.529
I could make you dead again.

25:16.580 --> 25:17.842
I should after what you did.

25:17.880 --> 25:19.108
It was never personal.

25:19.150 --> 25:20.777
Oh, that's not
true, Jackie.

25:20.820 --> 25:23.539
Sometimes it's very personal.

25:23.590 --> 25:25.319
I'm sorry you feel that way.
I'm not talking

25:25.350 --> 25:27.580
about me.
I'm talking about you.

25:27.620 --> 25:29.611
And Victor.

25:29.660 --> 25:31.719
You're not
cleaning up

25:31.760 --> 25:33.318
for him, are you?

25:33.360 --> 25:35.590
You're trying to hurt him.

25:35.630 --> 25:39.191
I don't know what he did to
you, but is it worth killing

25:39.230 --> 25:41.130
thousands of people?
Depends

25:41.170 --> 25:43.559
what you imagine he did to me.

25:43.610 --> 25:46.636
Where's the bomb, Jackie?

25:48.680 --> 25:51.569
You know,
truth is, you interest me.

25:51.610 --> 25:53.919
Oh, yeah?
You're a strong woman.

25:53.950 --> 25:56.214
But I worry about you.

25:56.250 --> 25:57.649
You worry about me?

25:57.690 --> 25:59.612
This violent temperament.

25:59.650 --> 26:01.311
Ah.

26:01.360 --> 26:02.679
IfI may be so bold,

26:02.720 --> 26:03.982
I imagine myself
a bit of a chemist.

26:04.030 --> 26:06.282
Yes, I have seen your work.

26:06.330 --> 26:08.628
In order for the mind
to work well, you need

26:08.660 --> 26:09.820
the right chemistry
in your body.

26:09.860 --> 26:10.963
Oh.
You?

26:11.000 --> 26:13.093
You need more greens
in your life.

26:13.130 --> 26:15.690
Would help you

26:15.740 --> 26:18.766
master your emotions,
see more clearly.

26:20.740 --> 26:22.708
A green smoothie.

26:22.740 --> 26:25.208
That's it.

26:25.250 --> 26:27.969
That's where you need to start.

26:31.820 --> 26:34.118
With ginger, maybe.

26:34.160 --> 26:35.889
It's good for the nerves.

26:35.920 --> 26:38.718
Little trade secret.

26:47.030 --> 26:48.099
And beet juice definitely.

26:48.140 --> 26:49.698
Its health benefits

26:49.740 --> 26:51.731
are invaluable.

26:58.810 --> 27:00.812
Know what I mean?

27:03.320 --> 27:05.948
I have no idea.

27:08.760 --> 27:11.422
Are you okay? What the hell
was she going on about?

27:11.460 --> 27:14.657
I don't know, but if I spend one
more minute in there with her,

27:14.700 --> 27:16.656
I can't be responsible
for what I'm gonna do.

27:16.700 --> 27:18.099
STONE:
We'll take it
from here.

27:20.970 --> 27:22.938
Listen to me. I need
to know what these mean.

27:22.970 --> 27:26.030
Yeah, sure.
Uh, could you give me a clue?

27:26.070 --> 27:28.675
Jackie gave 'em to me.

27:28.710 --> 27:30.337
I was watching you
guys the whole time.

27:30.380 --> 27:32.041
I didn't see her
pass anything to you.

27:32.080 --> 27:33.308
She must _have followed me
this morning

27:33.350 --> 27:34.908
and left those numbers
in a place I'd see,

27:34.950 --> 27:36.770
knowing I'd remember them
if she needed me to.

27:36.820 --> 27:38.117
Well, wait a minute.

27:38.150 --> 27:40.789
She left messages
in your memory?

27:40.820 --> 27:44.449
It's a little more complicated
than that, but essentially, yes.

27:44.490 --> 27:47.084
Oh. Okay, okay.

27:47.130 --> 27:48.893
But why is she telling you?

27:48.930 --> 27:50.249
If this could help her,

27:50.300 --> 27:52.291
why wouldn't she want
the ICA guys to know?

27:52.330 --> 27:54.093
Jay?

27:54.140 --> 27:55.698
Yeah?

27:55.740 --> 27:57.958
IfI needed
two minutes alone with her--

27:58.010 --> 28:01.707
and I mean alone--
could you get it for me?

28:01.740 --> 28:05.141
No-no cameras,
no Tom and Jerry watching?

28:05.180 --> 28:06.943
That depends.

28:06.980 --> 28:08.709
Ifneeded it,

28:08.750 --> 28:11.344
could you get me immunity
from federal prosecution?

28:11.390 --> 28:13.085
Absolutely.

28:13.120 --> 28:14.815
We've got work to do.

28:18.860 --> 28:20.259
So, these are Jackie's numbers.

28:20.290 --> 28:21.826
I've run cryptanalysis,

28:21.860 --> 28:23.350
block cypher,
Shor's quantum factoring.

28:23.400 --> 28:25.027
All I got is a partial match

28:25.070 --> 28:26.492
on the birthdates
of the Fearsome Foursome.

28:26.530 --> 28:29.431
L.A. Rams defensive
front, back in the '605?

28:29.470 --> 28:31.859
Rosey Grier, Deacon
Jones, Merlin...?

28:31.910 --> 28:33.730
Merlin who?
Olsen!

28:33.780 --> 28:35.907
I know who they are. What do
they have to do with this?

28:35.940 --> 28:37.077
That's the problem. Nothing.

28:37.110 --> 28:38.247
Well, that leaves
us nowhere.

28:38.280 --> 28:39.406
Well, I wouldn't
say nowhere.

28:39.450 --> 28:40.769
And I didn't even
need an algorithm.

28:40.820 --> 28:41.741
What do you got?

28:41.780 --> 28:43.111
When I first moved to Manhattan,

28:44.490 --> 28:46.287
at the James A.
Farley Post Office,

28:46.320 --> 28:47.514
the big one
right near Penn Station.

28:47.550 --> 28:49.859
I knew there was something
about those numbers.

28:49.890 --> 28:50.879
PO. box.
Mm-hmm.

28:50.930 --> 28:52.079
The first number--

28:52.130 --> 28:53.358
I bet you that's
the combination.

28:53.390 --> 28:55.096
The second one's the box number.

28:55.130 --> 28:56.791
THORNE:
You come up with anything?

28:56.830 --> 28:58.320
Uh, nothing yet. You?

28:58.370 --> 28:59.928
THORNE:
Agent Stone's contacted

28:59.970 --> 29:01.835
some people about moving Jackie
to a location

29:01.870 --> 29:03.428
_ where she can be
interrogated Vigorously.

29:03.470 --> 29:05.461
She's Alpha Five, Thorne.

29:05.510 --> 29:07.137
She's not going to talk,
whatever you do to her,

29:07.170 --> 29:08.933
and if she does,
it's not going to be the truth.

29:08.980 --> 29:10.971
I'll take my chances.

29:12.010 --> 29:13.773
Okay, so I have

29:13.820 --> 29:16.118
two plainclothes cops
watching the PO. box

29:16.150 --> 29:18.516
and a w_arrant_to
get in5ide of it.

29:18.550 --> 29:20.484
Great work, Murray.

29:20.520 --> 29:22.909
Thank you.
Ha!

29:34.840 --> 29:35.829
Hey, Johnny.

29:35.870 --> 29:37.167
Look like you've
lost weight.

29:37.200 --> 29:38.360
Hey, Carrie.

29:38.410 --> 29:40.970
Thanks for the tip
on the Cal-TCU game.

29:41.010 --> 29:43.877
Oh, yeah, well, you know,
easy money, right?

29:43.910 --> 29:45.241
Listen, I have a favor.

29:45.280 --> 29:48.909
Could you give us a
couple minutes alone?

29:48.950 --> 29:50.315
Ugh, I'm not supposed to.

29:50.350 --> 29:52.910
Come on. I'll be quick,
scout's honor.

29:54.520 --> 29:56.909
Thank you.

29:57.960 --> 29:58.984
Thank you.

29:59.030 --> 30:01.351
You know, I've always wondered
how it would feel

30:01.400 --> 30:03.129
to break 33 laws at once.

30:03.160 --> 30:04.491
How does it feel?

30:04.530 --> 30:06.225
I'll let you know.

30:06.270 --> 30:08.090
No, I'll let you know.

30:22.280 --> 30:24.544
Ah. Good work.

30:24.590 --> 30:25.614
What's on it?

30:25.650 --> 30:26.685
I couldn't break the encryption.

30:26.720 --> 30:30.611
Whatever it is, Victor wants it,
and I want Victor.

30:30.660 --> 30:32.355
Why are you telling me this?
Why not the ICA guys?

30:32.390 --> 30:34.028
They've been compromised.

30:34.060 --> 30:35.129
Thorne and Stone?

30:35.160 --> 30:36.457
I'm not sure who exactly,

30:36.500 --> 30:38.593
but someone in the ICA
is working with Victor.

30:38.630 --> 30:40.962
They killed
Sergei, not me.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.592
There's a code word-- CALAMUS.

30:42.640 --> 30:45.302
Use it, and you'll find out
everything you need to know.

30:45.340 --> 30:47.228
Why are you telling me?

30:47.270 --> 30:48.976
In my business,
knowing whom to trust

30:49.010 --> 30:51.399
is a matter of life and death.
I trust you.

30:51.450 --> 30:52.940
Victor buys people

30:52.980 --> 30:56.211
with money,
with love, with fear.

30:56.250 --> 31:00.380
But you... you can't be bought.

31:00.420 --> 31:01.182
Am I wrong?

31:01.220 --> 31:03.211
No. You, however,
do have a price,

31:03.260 --> 31:04.921
and it wasn't hard

31:04.960 --> 31:06.951
to find out what it is.

31:06.990 --> 31:09.299
David, your son with Victor.

31:11.030 --> 31:12.520
Am I wrong?

31:14.570 --> 31:15.935
What happened
to the camera feed?

31:15.970 --> 31:17.130
I don't know, sir.

31:17.170 --> 31:19.559
Uh, system must be overloaded,
but don't worry about it.

31:19.610 --> 31:21.874
I'm gonna find a way
to get us back.
Don't bother.

31:23.680 --> 31:25.545
Overloaded?

31:31.090 --> 31:33.046
Victor was never a father
to David.

31:33.090 --> 31:35.081
But he's a jealous man.

31:35.120 --> 31:37.987
I wanted to leave him,
and leave Alpha Five.

31:38.030 --> 31:40.055
So he took my
son from me.

31:40.090 --> 31:42.399
I thought he died
with his father on that plane,

31:42.430 --> 31:45.490
but he didn't,
and I want him back.

31:45.530 --> 31:47.418
And you were gonna trade this
for your son?

31:47.470 --> 31:49.688
Victor needs it for his plan,

31:49.740 --> 31:52.629
and my son needs
to live a free life.

31:52.670 --> 31:56.333
A normal boy,
not like one of us.

31:56.380 --> 31:58.644
How could your son ever hope
to be normal,

31:58.680 --> 32:00.079
knowing you paid for his freedom

32:00.110 --> 32:02.442
_with the lives
of innocent people?

32:02.480 --> 32:04.584
Jackie, I have the stick.

32:04.620 --> 32:07.088
I have you.
Why should I help you?

32:07.120 --> 32:09.088
Because you don't know Victor.

32:09.120 --> 32:12.453
He'll never give up,
even if you have that.

32:12.490 --> 32:14.697
He'll find another one,

32:14.730 --> 32:16.925
or make another.

32:19.070 --> 32:21.061
Yes, I need your help.

32:22.070 --> 32:24.265
But you still need mine.

32:32.080 --> 32:33.604
what happened
while the cameras were off.

32:33.650 --> 32:35.242
Okay?
Of course.

32:35.280 --> 32:38.545
Well, let's give them something
to talk about.

32:39.550 --> 32:40.983
Just...

32:41.020 --> 32:42.317
I'm really sorry.

32:45.090 --> 32:46.284
Damn it, Carrie. God.

32:46.330 --> 32:47.524
Hey! I know.

32:47.560 --> 32:49.357
I know. I'm sorry.
You said...

32:49.400 --> 32:50.355
I said, "Scout's honor."

32:50.400 --> 32:53.995
The truth is,
I got kicked out of Girl Scouts.

33:00.410 --> 33:02.207
Solid uppercut.
Thank you.

33:02.240 --> 33:04.299
So what'd she say while
the cameras were...

33:04.350 --> 33:06.477
"Overloaded"? Yeah, I overheard.

33:06.510 --> 33:08.114
That was the best
I could come up with.

33:08.150 --> 33:09.117
That Thorne guy scares me.

33:09.150 --> 33:09.946
With good reason.

33:09.980 --> 33:11.242
According to Jackie,
Thorne and Stone

33:11.290 --> 33:13.087
might be working with Victor.

33:13.120 --> 33:15.088
What?
Yeah. We got to find out
if she's right,

33:15.120 --> 33:17.111
and we've got to find out now.
Hold on.

33:17.160 --> 33:18.627
We can't just go
poking around the ICA.

33:18.660 --> 33:20.150
Those guys are real
super-spooks.

33:20.190 --> 33:22.021
She gave me a code word.
CALAMUS.

33:22.060 --> 33:24.096
Find me something, Jay.
Anything.

33:24.130 --> 33:25.620
I'm on it.

33:43.080 --> 33:45.139
Holy...

33:53.860 --> 33:54.690
We got a little problem.

33:54.730 --> 33:57.153
What'd you find?
You know that old line,

33:57.200 --> 33:58.622
"If I tell you,
then I have to kill you"?

33:58.670 --> 34:00.695
Well, this is sort of like that
only we all end up dead.

34:00.730 --> 34:03.699
Jay.
Okay, so back
when we took out bin Laden,

34:03.740 --> 34:06.163
turns out there was a ton
of stuff on hard drives

34:06.210 --> 34:08.701
in that compound that showed
evidence of a joint operation

34:08.740 --> 34:11.379
between the US. government
and al-Qaeda.

34:11.410 --> 34:13.549
Now, that operation
was called CALAMUS

34:13.580 --> 34:15.377
and was supposedly
the brainchild of a rogue group

34:15.420 --> 34:18.082
of agents working for the ICA.

34:18.120 --> 34:19.246
Okay, but ICA is a big agency.

34:19.290 --> 34:21.110
Right, so then I checked
with a buddy of mine

34:21.160 --> 34:24.220
in Washington about our pals
Thorne and Stone. Turns out

34:24.260 --> 34:26.182
they weren't assigned
to come down here and help us

34:26.230 --> 34:27.857
like they said.
They insisted on it.
So Jackie's right.

34:27.890 --> 34:30.097
They're working
with Victor and Alpha Five.

34:32.470 --> 34:34.688
Americans planning an attack
on their own people.

34:34.740 --> 34:36.389
But why?
There were
some references

34:36.440 --> 34:38.738
to Iran on the CALAMUS reports.
My guess is...

34:38.770 --> 34:40.863
they're trying to make it look
like Iran's behind this?

34:40.910 --> 34:43.231
Which would get us
into a war with Iran,

34:43.280 --> 34:45.441
tear apart the Middle East,
who knows what else.

34:45.480 --> 34:46.742
What's on the stick?

34:46.780 --> 34:48.418
Thought you'd never ask.

34:48.450 --> 34:51.146
Okay. Now, these look like...

34:51.190 --> 34:53.181
regular seventh grade
homework assignments.

34:53.220 --> 34:54.710
Most of 'em, freaking terrible.

34:54.760 --> 34:56.159
But like the
commerCIal says,

34:56.190 --> 34:57.282
there's more.

34:59.260 --> 35:01.694
Cryptography didn't work
with Jackie's clues. But here's

35:01.730 --> 35:03.288
why they need the stick.

35:03.330 --> 35:04.729
The enabling code

35:04.770 --> 35:06.192
for the bomb.
With it,

35:06.230 --> 35:07.322
they can arm the bomb.
Without it,

35:07.370 --> 35:08.564
they'll never be able
to detonate it.

35:08.600 --> 35:10.568
That's the price
for Jackie's son.

35:10.600 --> 35:12.568
A dead city and world war.

35:12.610 --> 35:14.237
Can you reprogram it?

35:14.280 --> 35:15.838
Yeah. To do what?

35:15.880 --> 35:17.404
Kill the bomb. Permanently.

35:17.440 --> 35:19.908
Okay, new plan.

35:19.950 --> 35:22.168
What do you got
in mind?
If we get caught,

35:22.220 --> 35:24.313
we all go to prison for
the rest of our lives.

35:25.350 --> 35:26.647
Carrie...

35:32.490 --> 35:34.492
Hey.

36:01.760 --> 36:03.751
Your move.

36:19.740 --> 36:20.832
We're here
to pick up the prisoner.

36:20.870 --> 36:22.701
Good morning to you, too,
gentlemen.

36:22.740 --> 36:24.401
We're in a rush.
Authorize the transfer.

36:24.450 --> 36:26.543
Not much for small talk,
are you?

36:26.580 --> 36:27.740
It's not
a problem.

36:27.780 --> 36:28.940
I'll just make the call,

36:28.980 --> 36:30.618
have her transferred...
JAY:
Hey, boss,

36:30.650 --> 36:31.844
I need to talk to you.
He's busy.

36:31.890 --> 36:34.518
Boss?
Not now, Jay.

36:34.560 --> 36:35.879
Yes, this is
Eliot.

36:35.920 --> 36:37.387
I'm authorizing
a transfer,

36:37.420 --> 36:40.389
prisoner's name
is Jacqueline Mikhailova.

36:40.430 --> 36:44.298
I have, uh, two federal officers
here who...

36:44.330 --> 36:45.922
Oh?

36:45.970 --> 36:47.995
Uh, all right.

36:48.030 --> 36:50.897
I will, uh, let them know. Um,

36:50.940 --> 36:53.602
must've been, uh,
some kind of mix-up.

36:53.640 --> 36:55.005
Lieutenant Burns
and Detective Wells

36:55.040 --> 36:57.008
have already taken her
into custody.

36:57.040 --> 36:58.007
What are you talking about?

36:58.040 --> 36:59.007
Easy. It's not a problem.

36:59.050 --> 37:00.938
They're headed
to your field office right now.

37:00.980 --> 37:03.312
By whose authorization
exactly?

37:03.350 --> 37:05.511
I'm... assuming yours.

37:05.550 --> 37:07.541
Exactly.
You are done,

37:07.590 --> 37:09.012
Eliot.

37:09.060 --> 37:10.857
When this is over,
I'm coming back

37:10.890 --> 37:13.256
and shutting down
this entire unit.

37:13.290 --> 37:15.497
Come on.

37:15.530 --> 37:16.622
You know,
I'm just

37:16.660 --> 37:17.991
gonna say it,
the chemistry's not there.

37:18.030 --> 37:20.260
Wait a minute,
how much do you know?

37:20.300 --> 37:22.996
Your asses aren't the only ones
on the line here.

37:23.040 --> 37:24.632
So you're in on it?

37:24.670 --> 37:26.831
I talked to Carrie and Al,
so yeah, I'm in on it.

37:26.870 --> 37:29.430
And, if this goes bad,
I plan to deny that.

37:29.480 --> 37:30.879
Boss, if
this thing

37:30.910 --> 37:33.970
goes bad, I'm not sure
who you'll be denying it to.

37:41.090 --> 37:42.978
Here are your things.

37:44.090 --> 37:44.988
Thought you
might need it.

37:46.590 --> 37:48.729
Victor is
very punctual.

37:48.760 --> 37:51.593
If I'm not there at the time
I texted, he'll be gone.

38:05.350 --> 38:07.944
Don't move.

38:07.980 --> 38:09.516
What's your problem, Stone?

38:09.550 --> 38:12.087
You're my problem, Lieutenant.
Get out of the car.
Lower your weapon, Steve.

38:12.120 --> 38:13.747
We're transferring a prisoner.

38:13.790 --> 38:15.018
STONE:
Why don't you let
us handle that.

38:15.060 --> 38:16.084
Get out.

38:16.120 --> 38:17.519
AL:
Let us by, Agent.

38:27.130 --> 38:29.928
Sorry.

38:36.140 --> 38:37.778
Take me to Victor.

39:05.640 --> 39:07.631
You...

39:07.670 --> 39:10.673
look good, my dear.

39:11.810 --> 39:13.778
Betrayal suits you.

39:13.810 --> 39:15.971
That makes two of us.

39:16.020 --> 39:18.909
He's my son, too.

39:21.150 --> 39:23.755
You have something for me?

39:23.790 --> 39:25.428
Where's David?

39:25.460 --> 39:26.825
He's here.

39:26.860 --> 39:28.725
We both know
I could

39:28.760 --> 39:31.024
kill you now
and take what is mine.

39:31.060 --> 39:32.891
But...

39:32.930 --> 39:34.431
I'm a man of honor.

39:34.470 --> 39:35.937
And a deal

39:35.970 --> 39:38.097
is a deal.

39:44.510 --> 39:46.774
David.

39:46.810 --> 39:50.644
It's okay, David.

39:50.680 --> 39:53.808
Everything's
going to be okay.

39:53.850 --> 39:56.057
VICTOR:
It's all right, my son.

39:56.090 --> 39:59.787
You... go get your things.

40:06.470 --> 40:07.459
Now...

40:09.740 --> 40:11.731
Please.

40:15.580 --> 40:18.674
This is the one they wanted me
to give you.

40:29.590 --> 40:32.058
This is the one you want.

40:32.090 --> 40:35.992
It's a copy of the one I took
from Yevgeny at the hospital.

40:43.270 --> 40:45.067
I knew I could
trust you.

40:45.110 --> 40:46.702
Always.

40:52.610 --> 40:56.171
You're sure
about this, Mr. Stone?

40:56.220 --> 40:59.189
I don't like killing
innocent Americans.

40:59.220 --> 41:02.212
But what we're doing today
is an act of patriotism.

41:02.260 --> 41:05.081
Ultimately, we're saving lives.

41:05.130 --> 41:07.223
This is our Boston Tea Party.

41:10.760 --> 41:12.466
So be it.

41:27.280 --> 41:28.508
Son of a bitch.

41:28.550 --> 41:29.517
She sold us out.

41:29.550 --> 41:30.642
AL:
No one move! Police!

41:30.680 --> 41:32.511
Drop it!

41:33.690 --> 41:36.113
Don't move!
Drop the weapon!

41:36.160 --> 41:38.253
Put 'em down!
Call for EMTs in here!

41:38.290 --> 41:41.691
Hands up.
Let's get some EMTs up here.

41:41.730 --> 41:43.618
Put your hands up.
Check him.

41:43.660 --> 41:46.629
All right, back off.

41:48.670 --> 41:51.264
Nice job,
Lieutenant.

41:51.300 --> 41:53.268
Thanks. Have to admit,

41:53.310 --> 41:55.870
when Eliot said you
were in the clear,

41:55.910 --> 41:58.902
I was a little surprised.

41:58.950 --> 42:01.043
THORNE:
Sorry I didn't see it.

42:01.080 --> 42:04.880
You guys really hauled my ass
out of the fire on this one.

42:04.920 --> 42:06.683
I owe you.

42:07.850 --> 42:08.953
VICTOR:
You know they'll never

42:08.990 --> 42:10.878
let you see him again.

42:10.920 --> 42:12.285
I'm sorry I couldn't kill you,

42:12.330 --> 42:14.252
but at least I got David away
from you.

42:14.290 --> 42:15.894
They won't be able to hold me.

42:15.930 --> 42:17.659
And then I will find him...

42:17.700 --> 42:18.860
and you.

42:18.900 --> 42:20.265
I'll be waiting.

42:22.300 --> 42:24.188
Move it!

42:26.310 --> 42:28.574
I didn't mean for this
to happen.

42:30.240 --> 42:31.571
Be a good boy.

42:31.610 --> 42:33.578
Yeah?

42:37.380 --> 42:38.938
Thank you.

42:38.990 --> 42:41.311
You made the right choice.

42:41.350 --> 42:45.320
I know I have no right
to ask anything of you, but...

42:45.360 --> 42:47.885
he shouldn't have to pay.

42:49.060 --> 42:51.221
Well, I'll make sure
to find him a home

42:51.260 --> 42:55.139
where he can have a normal life
and be happy.

42:56.870 --> 42:59.009
Trust me.

43:00.040 --> 43:02.372
I do.

43:02.410 --> 43:05.299
WOMAN:
Let's go.
