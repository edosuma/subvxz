WEBVTT

00:03.296 --> 00:05.582
( footsteps )

00:08.801 --> 00:10.837
(liquid sloshing)

00:14.807 --> 00:18.345
( branches snap )

00:28.446 --> 00:30.482
(groaning)

00:42.418 --> 00:44.329
(snarling )

01:09.070 --> 01:11.186
( clangs )

01:28.005 --> 01:30.872
(theme music playing )

02:12.508 --> 02:14.544
Okay, let's get
the other car in.

02:14.719 --> 02:17.085
We'll park 'em in
the west entry of the yard.

02:17.263 --> 02:19.595
Daryl: Good.
Our vehicles camped out there

02:19.765 --> 02:21.426
look like a giant
"vacancy" sign.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.727
Rick: After that, we need
to load up these corpses

02:23.894 --> 02:25.430
so we can burn 'em.

02:25.604 --> 02:27.731
T-Dog:
Gonna be a long day.

02:27.898 --> 02:29.809
Where's Glenn and Maggie?
We could use some help.

02:29.984 --> 02:32.225
Up in the guard tower.

02:33.696 --> 02:35.311
Guard tower?

02:35.489 --> 02:37.821
They were just
up there last night.

02:37.992 --> 02:40.654
Glenn! Maggie!

02:43.622 --> 02:46.284
(door clicks)

02:46.459 --> 02:48.871
Hey, what's up, guys?

02:49.045 --> 02:50.376
( laughs)

02:50.546 --> 02:53.583
- You coming?
- What?

02:53.758 --> 02:56.545
- ( all chuckle)
- Daryl: You comin'?

02:59.972 --> 03:01.678
Daryl: Come on,
we could use a hand.

03:01.849 --> 03:03.680
Yeah, we'll be
right down.

03:06.354 --> 03:07.969
So gross.

03:10.816 --> 03:12.352
Hey, Rick.

03:24.622 --> 03:26.112
Come with me.

03:32.171 --> 03:33.911
Rick:
That's close enough.

03:34.090 --> 03:38.333
- We had an agreement.
- Please, mister. We know that.

03:38.511 --> 03:42.675
We made a deal.
But you gotta understand...

03:42.848 --> 03:45.225
we can't live in that place
another minute.

03:45.393 --> 03:47.475
You follow me?
All the bodies--

03:47.645 --> 03:49.601
people we knew.

03:49.772 --> 03:52.684
Blood, brains everywhere.
There's ghosts.

03:52.858 --> 03:54.064
Why don't you
move the bodies out?

03:54.235 --> 03:55.975
You should be burning them.

03:56.153 --> 03:58.360
We tried. We did.

03:58.531 --> 04:01.864
The fence is down on
the far side of the prison.

04:02.034 --> 04:04.867
Every time we drag a body out,
those thingsjust line up.

04:07.206 --> 04:10.619
Look, we had nothing to do
with Tomas and Andrew.

04:10.793 --> 04:11.953
Nothing.

04:12.128 --> 04:15.040
You trying to prove a point?
You proved it, bro.

04:15.214 --> 04:17.580
We'll do whatever it takes
to be part of your group.

04:17.758 --> 04:19.794
Just please, please...

04:19.969 --> 04:23.553
don't make us
live in that place.

04:23.722 --> 04:25.804
Our deal is nonnegotiable.

04:25.975 --> 04:29.433
You either live in your cell block,
or you leave.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.343
(sighs)

04:31.522 --> 04:34.855
I told you this was
a waste of time.

04:35.025 --> 04:37.687
They ain't no different than
the pricks who shot up our boys.

04:37.862 --> 04:39.727
You know how many
friends' corpses

04:39.905 --> 04:41.941
we had to drag out
this week?

04:42.116 --> 04:44.198
Just threw 'em out, like.

04:44.368 --> 04:47.075
Humph.
These were good guys.

04:47.246 --> 04:49.407
Good guys who had our backs

04:49.582 --> 04:51.698
against the really bad
dudes in the joint,

04:51.876 --> 04:55.289
like Tomas and Andrew.

04:55.463 --> 04:59.081
We've all made mistakes
to get in here, chief.

04:59.258 --> 05:01.624
And I'm not gonna
pretend to be a saint,

05:01.802 --> 05:04.589
but believe me...

05:04.763 --> 05:05.969
we've paid our due--

05:06.140 --> 05:08.597
enough that we would
rather hit that road

05:08.767 --> 05:11.554
than to go back
into that shithole.

05:23.324 --> 05:25.030
C'mon, dude.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.951
Rick:
Are you serious?

05:30.122 --> 05:32.784
You want them living
in a cell next to you?

05:32.958 --> 05:35.415
They'll just be waiting
for a chance to grab our weapons.

05:35.586 --> 05:37.668
You want to go back
to sleeping with one eye open?

05:37.838 --> 05:39.794
I never stopped.

05:39.965 --> 05:42.172
Bring them into the fold.

05:42.343 --> 05:44.550
If we send them off packing, we might
as well execute them ourselves.

05:44.720 --> 05:47.302
I don't know.
Axel seems a little unstable.

05:47.473 --> 05:48.679
Carol: After all we've
been through?

05:48.849 --> 05:50.589
We fought so hard
for all this,

05:50.768 --> 05:52.258
what if they
decide to take it?

05:52.436 --> 05:53.471
Maggie:
It's just been us for so long.

05:53.646 --> 05:55.807
They're strangers.
I don't--

05:55.981 --> 05:58.358
it feels weird all of a sudden
having other people around.

05:58.526 --> 06:01.814
You brought us in.

06:01.987 --> 06:03.773
Yeah, but you turned up with
a shot boy in your arms.

06:03.948 --> 06:05.563
Didn't give us a choice.

06:05.741 --> 06:07.481
They can't even kill walkers.

06:07.660 --> 06:09.696
They're convicts,
bottom line.

06:09.870 --> 06:12.327
Those two might actually have less
blood on their hands than we do.

06:12.498 --> 06:14.284
| get guys like this.

06:14.458 --> 06:16.369
Hell, I grew up with them.

06:16.544 --> 06:18.409
They're degenerates,
but they ain't psychos.

06:18.587 --> 06:20.043
I could have been
in there with them

06:20.214 --> 06:22.330
just as easy as I'm out here
with you guys.

06:22.508 --> 06:25.591
- So are you with me?
- Hell, no.

06:25.761 --> 06:27.592
Let 'em take their chances
out on the road

06:27.763 --> 06:30.175
-just like we did.
- What I'm saying, Daryl--

06:30.349 --> 06:32.681
When I was a rookie,
l arrested this kid.

06:32.851 --> 06:36.764
19 years old,
wanted for stabbing his girlfriend.

06:36.939 --> 06:38.895
The kid blubbered
like a baby

06:39.066 --> 06:41.603
during the interrogation,
during the trial--

06:41.777 --> 06:43.859
suckered the jury.

06:44.029 --> 06:46.236
He was acquitted
due to insufficient evidence

06:46.407 --> 06:47.613
and then,
two weeks later,

06:47.783 --> 06:51.367
shot another girl.

06:51.537 --> 06:54.995
We've been through
too much.

06:55.165 --> 06:57.702
Our deal with them stands.

07:05.384 --> 07:07.375
(truck engine rewing,
faint digging)

07:09.805 --> 07:12.512
( people chatting )

08:02.483 --> 08:04.394
Pretty amazing.

08:05.819 --> 08:09.482
We find more ammo, we could cut
down a whole pack of biters.

08:12.785 --> 08:15.117
I hear you and Andrea
are leaving today.

08:15.287 --> 08:16.948
That's a shame.

08:17.122 --> 08:19.579
We could use
a soldier like you.

08:22.086 --> 08:24.919
You seem like
you're holding your own.

08:25.089 --> 08:28.422
Even the National Guard
was overrun.

08:28.592 --> 08:31.425
No amount of training can prepare
you for the world today.

08:34.515 --> 08:38.758
You'd think one soldier
would drive away--

08:38.936 --> 08:41.803
especially against
something so slow.

08:41.980 --> 08:45.564
Those men were heroes.

08:45.734 --> 08:48.771
Not the kind to leave
anyone behind.

08:51.657 --> 08:55.149
If only we'd
gotten there sooner...

08:55.327 --> 08:58.364
and you were with us.

09:01.667 --> 09:03.953
Lots of bullet holes.

09:05.337 --> 09:08.170
You think biters figured out
how to use weapons?

09:11.969 --> 09:15.587
They must have
encountered bandits weeks ago.

09:15.764 --> 09:18.847
lt's ugly out there,
butthen".

09:19.017 --> 09:21.144
you know that
better than anyone.

09:21.311 --> 09:23.688
It's too bad
what happened to Wells.

09:25.858 --> 09:27.974
It is.

09:28.152 --> 09:31.519
Dr. Stevens
couldn't revive him.

09:31.697 --> 09:33.733
Merle put a bullet
in his brain.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.363
No funeral?

09:35.534 --> 09:37.320
We cremated him, quietly.

09:39.288 --> 09:41.279
These people
have been through so much,

09:41.457 --> 09:44.540
I figured, thank God,
at least no one knew him.

09:48.338 --> 09:51.045
Thank God.

09:59.892 --> 10:01.553
Rick: Move the cars
to the upper yard.

10:01.727 --> 10:03.763
Point 'em facing out.

10:03.937 --> 10:06.770
They'll be out of the way but ready
to go if we ever need to bail.

10:09.610 --> 10:10.941
We'll give the prisoners

10:11.111 --> 10:14.353
a week's worth of supplies
for the road.

10:14.531 --> 10:16.522
Might not last a week.

10:16.700 --> 10:18.406
It's their choice.

10:18.577 --> 10:19.908
Did they really
have one?

10:20.078 --> 10:21.693
Hey, hey--

10:21.872 --> 10:23.737
whose blood would you
rather have on your hands--

10:23.916 --> 10:27.579
Maggie's, Glenn's,
or theirs?

10:27.753 --> 10:30.586
- Neither.
- ( car engine starts)

10:36.011 --> 10:38.844
Twin cylinder.
Is that a Triumph?

10:39.014 --> 10:41.505
Don't even look at it.

10:41.683 --> 10:45.426
- Didn't want to bore it out?
- ( motor revs )

10:45.604 --> 10:47.469
Sounds like
it could use a tune-up.

10:47.648 --> 10:49.764
I'm pretty handy
with a wrench.

10:51.193 --> 10:54.777
Heads are leakin'.
I know my bikes!

10:54.947 --> 10:56.858
Man, will you
just stop?

10:57.032 --> 10:59.398
Have some balls.

10:59.576 --> 11:01.282
Just sayin'.

11:08.502 --> 11:11.118
( door opens)

11:19.221 --> 11:21.462
All right.

11:30.315 --> 11:32.226
Just take your time.

11:34.152 --> 11:35.688
Daddy, don't
push yourself.

11:35.863 --> 11:39.105
( chuckles)
What else am I going to do?

11:39.283 --> 11:40.443
I can't stand
looking up

11:40.617 --> 11:42.824
at that bottom
of that bunk any longer--

11:42.995 --> 11:44.656
Whoa.

11:47.457 --> 11:49.709
(tapping )

11:54.381 --> 11:58.215
You know, I think
I'm pretty steady.

12:01.847 --> 12:03.553
That's a good start.

12:03.724 --> 12:05.180
Want to take a rest?

12:05.350 --> 12:07.215
Rest?
( chuckles )

12:07.394 --> 12:10.477
Let's go for a little stroll.

12:13.609 --> 12:15.520
If we leave soon,

12:15.694 --> 12:17.810
we'll got a few hours
on the road before dusk.

12:17.988 --> 12:19.774
Where are we heading?

12:19.948 --> 12:21.188
I'm thinking the coast.

12:21.366 --> 12:23.197
We have the water
completely on one side,

12:23.368 --> 12:26.201
maybe we find a boat.

12:26.371 --> 12:29.033
Best thing we can do
is find an island.

12:29.207 --> 12:31.414
And if the coast
isn't safe?

12:31.585 --> 12:34.952
Keep moving.

12:35.130 --> 12:36.711
Let's say
the coast is safe.

12:36.882 --> 12:39.544
Then what do we do?
Just grow old,

12:39.718 --> 12:42.630
live off the sea
by ourselves?

12:42.804 --> 12:45.216
I'd rather take my chances out
there than stay here.

12:45.390 --> 12:48.757
Because your gut tells you there's
something off about this place--

12:48.936 --> 12:50.927
about the Governor?

12:52.397 --> 12:55.059
lt's kept us alive
this long.

12:55.233 --> 12:57.940
That's true.

13:06.578 --> 13:08.660
There's enough food in there
to last you guys a week.

13:08.830 --> 13:11.412
Cut you loose
when we get back.

13:11.583 --> 13:13.448
Thank you, bro.

13:15.212 --> 13:17.123
Sit tight.

13:20.634 --> 13:23.091
Oscar:
"Thank you, bro"?

13:29.935 --> 13:32.096
(engine starts)

13:33.605 --> 13:35.687
- Glenn: Should I take her out?
- Rick: No.

13:35.857 --> 13:38.894
If that armory hadn't been picked
clean, we could spare the ammo.

13:39.069 --> 13:41.401
I'll start making runs.
The sooner the better.

13:41.571 --> 13:43.732
We'll throw as much wood
as we can in the dog run.

13:43.907 --> 13:45.192
Won't the fire
attract more walkers?

13:45.367 --> 13:46.402
Maybe we should
bury them.

13:46.576 --> 13:48.112
We're behind the fence.

13:48.286 --> 13:50.242
It's worth the one-time risk to get rid
of the bodies for good.

13:50.414 --> 13:53.577
I don't want to be planting crops
in walker-rotted soil.

14:08.015 --> 14:10.381
Got you here
if you need it.

14:10.559 --> 14:12.515
Just take your time
on these steps.

14:12.686 --> 14:14.972
Ooh, ooh.

14:19.651 --> 14:23.018
Hershel: You cleared
all those bodies out?

14:23.196 --> 14:25.778
lt's starting to look like a place
we could really live in.

14:25.949 --> 14:26.984
Hey, you watch
your step.

14:27.159 --> 14:28.490
Last thing we need
is you falling.

14:36.668 --> 14:39.535
He is one tough
son of a bitch.

14:39.713 --> 14:42.170
( chuckles )

14:42.340 --> 14:43.921
- All right, Hershel!
- Shh!

14:44.092 --> 14:45.548
Keep your
cheers down.

14:45.719 --> 14:48.051
(growling)

14:48.221 --> 14:51.213
Oh man, can't we just have
one good day?

14:52.517 --> 14:56.009
You're doing great, Daddy.

14:56.188 --> 14:57.678
Ready to race, Hershel?

14:57.856 --> 14:59.847
Give me another day.

15:00.025 --> 15:02.311
- I'll take you on.
- ( Carl chuckles )

15:05.864 --> 15:09.527
Grab the rest of these bodies,
we can go ahead and take 'em down.

15:09.701 --> 15:11.077
( chuckles )

15:36.895 --> 15:39.511
- ( growling )
- Walkers! Look out!

15:43.777 --> 15:45.642
No!

15:47.239 --> 15:50.276
(walkers snarling )

15:50.450 --> 15:52.031
(gunfire)

15:52.202 --> 15:55.285
Rick:
Get out!

15:55.455 --> 15:58.071
Get out of there!
Now!

15:58.250 --> 16:01.162
Lori!

16:01.336 --> 16:03.668
(growling)

16:14.724 --> 16:17.431
Go!
Come in here!

16:20.939 --> 16:22.770
Daddy, behind you!

16:31.116 --> 16:33.072
The lock-- hurry up!

16:33.243 --> 16:34.699
Thelock!

16:34.870 --> 16:37.737
Keys!

16:37.914 --> 16:40.121
That gate is open!

16:43.670 --> 16:46.002
Lori! Here!

16:56.308 --> 16:57.844
Come on!

17:08.153 --> 17:09.984
- ( snarling )
- This way.

17:18.330 --> 17:21.493
Get out of my way!

17:21.666 --> 17:24.328
Daryl: Come on.
Come on, come on!

17:36.431 --> 17:38.262
Axel:
Hey, bro, what about us?

17:38.433 --> 17:39.548
( growls )

17:39.726 --> 17:41.808
( screams )

17:41.978 --> 17:43.514
No!

17:45.774 --> 17:46.934
Come on!

17:48.985 --> 17:50.850
Hurry!

18:00.038 --> 18:03.326
l circled where you can find that
farm l was staying at with Daryl.

18:06.378 --> 18:08.710
Oh, yeah, you were
right off Route 9

18:08.880 --> 18:11.713
right before it becomes
Dahlonega Highway.

18:11.883 --> 18:13.714
And you're saying
that the farmhouse

18:13.885 --> 18:16.126
is only about a day's
walk from there?

18:16.304 --> 18:18.215
Give or take.

18:18.390 --> 18:20.176
This is where
we looked for Sophia.

18:20.350 --> 18:23.012
Even made it
up around here.

18:25.855 --> 18:28.892
How come
we never hooked up?

18:30.485 --> 18:32.567
You called me
a whore...

18:32.737 --> 18:34.238
and a rugmuncher.

18:34.406 --> 18:37.193
( chuckles )
Got a way with words, don't I?

18:37.367 --> 18:40.074
-Yeah.
-Mmm.

18:41.663 --> 18:43.369
Why are you
doing this?

18:46.543 --> 18:49.535
I'd want the same thing
if it was my family out there.

18:51.006 --> 18:53.873
Sure you don't
wanna come with me?

18:54.050 --> 18:56.587
You ain't curious
about the old gang?

18:59.431 --> 19:00.921
Oh...!

19:01.099 --> 19:03.932
Oh yeah, you really was
cut loose, weren't you?

19:04.102 --> 19:05.763
I'm sure they came back.

19:05.937 --> 19:07.598
I didn't stick around
to find out.

19:07.772 --> 19:10.935
Ain't that
a big ol' pig sack?

19:12.277 --> 19:15.110
We got something
in common, blondie.

19:15.280 --> 19:17.896
We got left behind
by the same people...

19:18.074 --> 19:20.736
and saved by another.

19:23.955 --> 19:26.332
Have you ever thought about
leaving this place?

19:26.499 --> 19:28.535
(sighs)

19:28.710 --> 19:31.372
Never had a reason to.

19:31.546 --> 19:34.128
So the Governor
is a good man?

19:35.717 --> 19:37.833
Let me just
put it this way--

19:38.011 --> 19:40.548
I wasn't in the best
of shape when he found me.

19:40.722 --> 19:44.340
He should have
just kept on going.

19:44.517 --> 19:47.975
Yeah, he's a good man.

19:55.278 --> 19:56.859
Let's go. Pull it!

19:57.030 --> 19:58.986
(snarling )

20:00.325 --> 20:02.281
- What the hell happened?
- Beth: The gate was open!

20:02.452 --> 20:03.817
Where's Lori, Carl--
everyone else?

20:03.995 --> 20:06.236
Maggie led Lori and Carl
into C block.

20:06.414 --> 20:07.824
- Beth: But T was bit!
- Anyone else?

20:07.999 --> 20:09.500
- Beth: I couldn't tell.
- Stay put.

20:11.294 --> 20:12.659
(gurgles)

20:17.384 --> 20:18.499
Those chains didn't
break on their own.

20:18.676 --> 20:20.758
Someone took an ax
or cutters to 'em.

20:22.305 --> 20:23.886
(walkers growling )

20:24.057 --> 20:27.174
- You think they did it?
- Who else?

20:27.352 --> 20:28.888
(alarm blaring )

20:29.062 --> 20:31.849
What's that?

20:32.023 --> 20:34.560
Oh-- you gotta be
kidding me!

20:37.404 --> 20:39.645
( blaring continues)

20:39.823 --> 20:41.359
Daryl!

20:43.493 --> 20:45.404
( Hershel yelling )
K"! it!

20:45.578 --> 20:48.866
(snarling )

20:49.040 --> 20:50.905
Back up!

20:53.128 --> 20:54.538
How the hell
can this be happening?!

20:54.712 --> 20:56.703
Whoa-whoa-whoa!
It has to be the backup generators.

20:56.881 --> 20:58.212
Well, how do you
turn those on?

20:58.383 --> 21:00.874
There's three that's connected
to a diesel tank, okay?

21:01.052 --> 21:02.667
Each one controls a certain
part of the prison.

21:02.846 --> 21:04.677
The hacks shut 'em all off
when the prison was overrun.

21:04.848 --> 21:06.884
Can someone open up
the main gates electronically

21:07.058 --> 21:09.140
- with full power?
- | only worked in there a few days.

21:09.310 --> 21:10.925
I guess it might
be possible.

21:11.104 --> 21:13.937
- Come with us!
- Glenn: Let's go!

21:16.985 --> 21:18.100
T-Dog:
There's a set of double doors

21:18.278 --> 21:19.393
that will lead
to a corridor

21:19.571 --> 21:20.856
that'll get you back
to our cell block.

21:21.030 --> 21:22.566
- Carol: You should stop.
- I'm getting you there!

21:22.740 --> 21:25.356
- Stop!
- Why? Sit here and wait to die?

21:25.535 --> 21:27.992
I'll do what I have to. You're not
becoming one of those things.

21:28.163 --> 21:31.701
- I can't ask that.
- It's the pact, remember?

21:31.875 --> 21:33.786
This is God's plan.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.951
He'll take care of me.
Always has.

21:36.129 --> 21:38.620
He's gonna help me
lead you out of these tunnels.

21:38.798 --> 21:41.710
(alarm blaring continues)

21:48.975 --> 21:50.886
(grunts)

21:51.060 --> 21:52.470
- Can you keep up?
- Lori: Something's not right.

21:52.645 --> 21:54.977
- Carl: Are you bit?
- Lori: No, no, no.

21:55.148 --> 21:57.104
I think
the baby's coming.

21:57.275 --> 21:59.766
-Mom?
- ( walkers snarling )

21:59.944 --> 22:01.935
No, there's no time.
Turn back.

22:02.113 --> 22:04.445
(snarling continues)

22:06.451 --> 22:08.567
(Lori grunting,
coughing )

22:08.745 --> 22:11.282
(growling)

22:18.963 --> 22:20.954
ln here!

22:24.427 --> 22:26.634
(thumps)

22:27.931 --> 22:30.172
(grunts)

22:33.978 --> 22:36.594
( alarm blaring
conﬁnues)

22:39.651 --> 22:41.812
( panting )

22:45.323 --> 22:47.439
( alarm continues )

22:47.617 --> 22:49.733
(growling)

22:51.162 --> 22:53.153
( gasps )

23:06.219 --> 23:09.632
( ball clatters )

23:23.278 --> 23:26.645
( whistles )
Pretty good.

23:26.823 --> 23:29.280
We should visit
Augusta.

23:29.450 --> 23:31.611
Take only the women
and let them play.

23:31.786 --> 23:33.617
It'll be historic.

23:33.788 --> 23:35.904
And break decades
of tradition?

23:36.082 --> 23:38.664
Absolutely.

23:38.835 --> 23:40.120
- Merle: I don't know.
- ( faint thump)

23:40.295 --> 23:42.957
Some things are
worth holding on to.

23:45.258 --> 23:48.216
You know, I was thinking
of taking Tim and Martinez

23:48.386 --> 23:50.217
out on a scouting mission
later on this week.

23:50.388 --> 23:53.380
For what?

23:53.558 --> 23:55.594
Blondie.

23:55.768 --> 23:58.350
She said my brother
was still alive.

24:00.940 --> 24:03.101
Eight months ago.

24:04.402 --> 24:05.938
You can track
with the best of 'em,

24:06.112 --> 24:08.273
but it's like
a needle in a haystack.

24:09.616 --> 24:11.948
She told me where I could find
that farmhouse

24:12.118 --> 24:14.200
they were holed up in.

24:16.456 --> 24:18.367
He could be anywhere.

24:18.541 --> 24:21.578
I know my brother.

24:21.753 --> 24:24.586
If he's out there,
I'll be able to find him.

24:27.967 --> 24:31.425
What if someone gets hurt
during this search, huh?

24:31.596 --> 24:34.383
What almost happened
to Crowley last time.

24:36.684 --> 24:39.096
Then I'll go on my own.

24:41.314 --> 24:42.895
| get what you're feeling,
I really do,

24:43.066 --> 24:45.523
but I can't risk it.
I need you here.

24:47.403 --> 24:49.940
This whole place
would fall apart without you.

24:52.742 --> 24:54.357
This is my brother.

24:58.122 --> 24:59.828
Tell you what, huh?

24:59.999 --> 25:03.708
You get more concrete information,
I'll go with you myself.

25:05.046 --> 25:07.037
All right?

25:13.346 --> 25:15.337
(gunshot
alarm blaring )

25:16.974 --> 25:18.805
Lori!

25:18.976 --> 25:21.262
Carl!

25:23.147 --> 25:25.138
We just took down
five of 'em in there.

25:25.316 --> 25:28.774
There were four in here,
but no sign of Lori or any of them.

25:28.945 --> 25:32.153
They must have been pushed back
into the prison.

25:32.323 --> 25:34.814
Somebody
is playing games!

25:34.992 --> 25:36.653
We'll split up
and look for the others.

25:36.828 --> 25:38.739
Whoever gets to the generators
first, shut 'em down!

25:38.913 --> 25:40.244
Let's go!

25:42.500 --> 25:45.242
( grunts )
What are those alarms?

25:45.420 --> 25:47.581
Don't worry about it.

25:47.755 --> 25:50.747
- What if it attracts them?
- ( Lori panting )

25:50.925 --> 25:53.337
- Lori, let's lay you down.
- No-- the baby's coming now.

25:53.511 --> 25:55.593
We have to get back to our cell block
and have Hershel help.

25:55.763 --> 25:57.094
Maggie: We can't risk getting
caught out there.

25:57.265 --> 25:59.176
You're gonna need to give birth
to this baby here.

25:59.350 --> 26:01.682
Great.
( panting )

26:01.853 --> 26:03.309
What is she doing?
Can't she breathe?

26:03.479 --> 26:05.856
She's fine. Come here--
let's get your pants off.

26:06.023 --> 26:08.639
- ( buckle rattles )
- Okay.

26:08.818 --> 26:11.309
( Lori grunts)
Okay.

26:14.532 --> 26:16.648
You're gonna need to help deliver your
brother or sister. You up for it?

26:19.912 --> 26:21.618
I'll do an exam.
Let me see if you're dilated.

26:21.789 --> 26:24.701
- Okay.
- Do you know how?

26:24.876 --> 26:26.616
Dad taught me, but trust me,
it's my first time.

26:26.794 --> 26:30.082
(grunts)

26:30.256 --> 26:32.417
- I can't tell.
- I gotta push.

26:32.592 --> 26:34.332
I gotta push.

26:34.510 --> 26:36.967
( grunts, huffs )

26:37.138 --> 26:39.720
Whew... whew...

26:39.891 --> 26:43.179
(grunting)

26:43.352 --> 26:46.014
Somebody!

26:46.189 --> 26:48.054
- I'm okay, I'm okay.
- Maggie: Okay.

26:48.232 --> 26:50.894
You're doing great, Lori.
Just keep doing it.

26:51.068 --> 26:53.935
Your body knows what to do.
Let it do all the work.

26:55.782 --> 26:58.023
( Lori yelps)

26:58.201 --> 27:01.568
- You're doing great.
-( breathing heavily )

27:01.746 --> 27:04.579
(grunts)

27:04.749 --> 27:06.455
Lori, sopt, don't push.
Something's wrong.

27:06.626 --> 27:08.582
( screams )

27:12.215 --> 27:15.298
T-Dog:
We're almost there.

27:17.220 --> 27:18.426
(snarling )

27:19.764 --> 27:20.844
(gun clicking)

27:21.015 --> 27:22.721
Oh, shit.
Go back!

27:22.892 --> 27:24.473
- No. We're close. We're close!
- No!

27:24.644 --> 27:27.556
(yells)

27:29.023 --> 27:31.435
Go! Go!

27:31.609 --> 27:35.101
Go! Get out!

27:37.156 --> 27:39.442
Go! I'm dead!
( screams )

27:47.041 --> 27:49.282
( bottles clink)

27:49.460 --> 27:51.621
Sorry to see you leave.

27:53.381 --> 27:55.167
This place
isn't for everybody.

27:55.341 --> 27:58.253
Thank you...
for everything.

27:59.804 --> 28:01.294
Where are you
planning to go?

28:01.472 --> 28:03.303
The coast.

28:03.474 --> 28:05.760
Michonne thinks
it'll be safer.

28:08.020 --> 28:10.727
What do you think?

28:12.817 --> 28:16.105
Well, her vigilance
has kept you both alive.

28:16.279 --> 28:17.359
(stopper pops)

28:17.530 --> 28:20.146
Oh-- I haven't had
hard liquor in a while.

28:20.324 --> 28:22.986
My tolerance is probably
close to nil.

28:23.160 --> 28:25.287
Lucky you.

28:25.454 --> 28:27.035
Merle told me you
provided information

28:27.206 --> 28:28.821
about his brother's
whereabouts.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.458
What I could.
It wasn't much.

28:32.628 --> 28:34.619
Well, it's given him hope.

28:34.797 --> 28:37.163
If you ask me,
I don't think he'll find him.

28:37.341 --> 28:39.457
- But he's gotta look--
- Governor: Gotta look.

28:39.635 --> 28:41.626
( chuckles )

28:47.351 --> 28:49.342
What about you?

28:49.520 --> 28:51.135
Think you'll find
what you're looking for?

28:51.314 --> 28:55.648
- I'm sorry?
- You still got family out there?

28:57.653 --> 28:59.814
I lost my family.

28:59.989 --> 29:02.856
My parents,
my sister.

29:05.453 --> 29:07.865
I'm sorry.

29:08.039 --> 29:10.997
Lost my wife--
car accident.

29:11.167 --> 29:13.408
18 months
before all this.

29:15.588 --> 29:18.170
Just my daughter and me.

29:23.220 --> 29:25.211
To better days.

29:31.103 --> 29:33.970
( chuckles )

29:34.148 --> 29:36.139
(clinks)

29:39.570 --> 29:43.062
Ahh.
This is good.

29:46.202 --> 29:50.411
Truth is, I don't know
what I'm looking for.

29:50.581 --> 29:52.913
For the longest time,
it was all about survival.

29:53.084 --> 29:54.870
Nothing else mattered.

29:55.044 --> 29:57.251
So much so...

29:57.421 --> 30:00.663
I don't know
what matters now.

30:00.841 --> 30:03.093
Pay off the car,

30:03.260 --> 30:05.876
work 50 hours a week,
get married,

30:06.055 --> 30:10.139
buy a house-- that was survival
for many not long ago.

30:10.309 --> 30:12.391
A lot's changed.

30:15.231 --> 30:17.313
The scenery has.

30:17.483 --> 30:20.600
Thelandscape.

30:20.778 --> 30:23.190
But the way
we think...

30:30.496 --> 30:32.578
I better go.

30:32.748 --> 30:34.363
But I appreciate
the drink.

30:34.542 --> 30:36.999
Sure.

30:37.169 --> 30:40.627
Merle will see you out and he'll have
your weapons waiting for you.

30:42.842 --> 30:45.174
Remember--

30:45.344 --> 30:47.460
if it gets tough
out there,

30:47.638 --> 30:49.549
you're always
welcome here.

30:49.724 --> 30:51.806
That's very kind.

30:51.976 --> 30:54.388
- Thank you, Governor.
- Philip.

30:54.562 --> 30:56.473
I thought you never
told anybody your name.

30:56.647 --> 30:58.854
Someone recently told me
never to say never, so...

30:59.025 --> 31:00.811
( chuckles )

31:00.985 --> 31:03.192
Well...

31:03.362 --> 31:05.478
take care.

31:11.412 --> 31:13.494
Goodbye.

31:25.926 --> 31:29.089
(walkers growling,
snarling )

31:29.263 --> 31:31.595
Rick:
Daryl, get the door!

31:38.856 --> 31:40.346
How do you
shut these down?!

31:40.524 --> 31:43.186
Go help him.
I got it.

31:43.360 --> 31:45.487
Right here.

31:48.616 --> 31:50.277
(yelling)

31:50.451 --> 31:51.486
(grunts)

31:57.958 --> 31:59.368
(groaning)

32:08.719 --> 32:10.050
(gunshot)

32:36.872 --> 32:40.581
Shoot him!
We can take back this prison.

32:44.672 --> 32:46.287
What you waiting for?
Do it!

32:46.465 --> 32:48.421
It's our house.
Shoot him!

33:04.108 --> 33:06.394
( alarm continues )

33:12.741 --> 33:14.197
( generator whirrs down )

33:14.368 --> 33:15.778
( alarms stop )

33:15.953 --> 33:17.318
Let's go.

33:20.040 --> 33:21.701
Mom...?

33:21.876 --> 33:23.707
Mom, look at me, look at me.
Keep your eyes open.

33:23.878 --> 33:25.493
We have to get you
back to Dad.

33:25.671 --> 33:27.081
I'm not gonna make it.

33:27.256 --> 33:28.416
Lori, with all this blood,

33:28.591 --> 33:29.956
I don't even think
you're fully dilated yet.

33:30.134 --> 33:31.499
No amount of pushing
is gonna help.

33:31.677 --> 33:36.091
I know what it means,
and I'm not losing my baby.

33:36.265 --> 33:37.801
You've got to cut me open.

33:39.351 --> 33:42.718
- No. I can't.
- You don't have a choice.

33:42.897 --> 33:45.138
- I'll go for help.
- No!

33:47.818 --> 33:49.149
Carol's the one
that practiced that.

33:49.320 --> 33:50.901
Dad only taught me
the steps, Lori. lf |--

33:51.071 --> 33:53.027
- Please.
- l have no anesthetic,

33:53.199 --> 33:55.155
- no equipment--
- Carl has a knife.

33:57.161 --> 33:58.947
You won't survive.

33:59.121 --> 34:00.827
My baby has to survive.

34:00.998 --> 34:02.704
Please.

34:02.875 --> 34:06.038
My baby...
for all of us.

34:06.212 --> 34:09.329
Please, Maggie!
Please!

34:09.506 --> 34:13.169
( Lori gasping )

34:13.344 --> 34:15.460
Please.

34:20.226 --> 34:22.182
I thought
we had an agreement.

34:22.353 --> 34:24.389
We can always leave tomorrow
or the following day.

34:24.563 --> 34:26.178
The following day?

34:26.357 --> 34:28.097
We don't want to walk into trouble
that we can't get out of.

34:28.275 --> 34:31.483
- Tell me about it.
- Michonne, it is just a day or two.

34:31.654 --> 34:35.192
I heard you
the first time.

34:37.660 --> 34:40.493
( door opens, closes)

34:41.956 --> 34:45.244
Lori: You see my old
C-section scar?

34:45.417 --> 34:47.499
- I can't.
- You can.

34:47.670 --> 34:50.537
You have to.

34:50.714 --> 34:52.875
Carl?

34:53.050 --> 34:55.382
Baby, I don't want you
to be scared, okay?

34:55.552 --> 34:58.009
This is what I want.
This is right.

34:58.180 --> 35:01.092
Now you-- you take care
of your daddy for me, all right?

35:01.267 --> 35:03.553
And your little brother
or sister, you take care--

35:03.727 --> 35:04.933
You don't
have to do this.

35:05.104 --> 35:07.060
You're gonna be fine.

35:07.231 --> 35:09.563
You are gonna beat this world.
I know you will.

35:09.733 --> 35:11.689
You are smart,
and you are strong,

35:11.860 --> 35:15.569
and you are so brave,
and I love you.

35:15.739 --> 35:18.071
I love you too.

35:19.743 --> 35:22.325
You gotta do
what's right, baby.

35:23.622 --> 35:27.865
You promise me,
you'll always do what's right.

35:28.043 --> 35:30.580
It's so easy to do the wrong thing
in this world.

35:33.590 --> 35:35.751
So don't--

35:35.926 --> 35:39.885
so if it feels wrong,
don't do it, all right?

35:40.055 --> 35:41.670
If it feels easy,
don't do it.

35:41.849 --> 35:44.181
Don't let the world
spoil you.

35:46.645 --> 35:48.931
You're so good.

35:52.526 --> 35:55.484
You're my sweet boy.

35:55.654 --> 35:59.272
You're the best thing lever did.
And I love you.

35:59.450 --> 36:02.112
(sobs)
Hoveyou.

36:02.286 --> 36:06.905
You're my sweet, sweet boy.
I love you.

36:07.082 --> 36:09.915
(sobs)

36:11.837 --> 36:13.623
Okay--
okay, now.

36:13.797 --> 36:16.174
Okay.
( grunts )

36:16.342 --> 36:18.628
Maggie, when this is over,
you're gonna have to--

36:18.802 --> 36:21.293
You have to do it.
It can't be Rick.

36:25.309 --> 36:27.641
All right... all right.

36:27.811 --> 36:31.053
It's all right.
It's all right.

36:31.231 --> 36:32.311
Whew...

36:40.574 --> 36:44.317
Whew.
Good night, love.

36:47.414 --> 36:49.746
I'm sorry.

36:49.917 --> 36:52.784
( screams )

36:54.963 --> 36:56.669
You're killing her!

36:56.840 --> 36:59.502
(shudders)

37:02.679 --> 37:04.840
Carl, give me
yourhands.

37:05.015 --> 37:06.551
Carl, please.

37:06.725 --> 37:08.010
You should keep
the site clean, okay?

37:08.185 --> 37:10.517
If I cut too deep,
I'm gonna cut the baby.

37:16.026 --> 37:17.891
Good, come on.

37:18.070 --> 37:20.311
| see it.
| see the ears.

37:20.489 --> 37:22.025
I'm gonna pull it out.

37:23.867 --> 37:26.529
I can't tell if
this is the arm or the leg.

37:26.703 --> 37:29.615
Okay, I'm gonna
pull the baby out.

37:32.042 --> 37:34.124
Okay...

37:59.778 --> 38:02.394
-( infant cries )
- ( Carl gasps )

38:06.243 --> 38:08.234
(crying)

38:13.625 --> 38:18.039
- We have to go.
- We can't just leave her here.

38:18.213 --> 38:20.465
She'll turn.

38:22.759 --> 38:26.547
- No.
- Carl...

38:26.722 --> 38:29.759
She's my mom.

38:29.933 --> 38:32.424
(crying)

38:43.322 --> 38:45.734
(sobbing )

38:47.784 --> 38:50.446
Rick's voice:
No more kid stuff.

38:50.621 --> 38:52.361
People are gonna die.

38:52.539 --> 38:54.780
I'm gonna die...

38:54.958 --> 38:57.791
Mom...

38:57.961 --> 39:01.795
There's no way
you can ever be ready for it.

39:01.965 --> 39:04.297
(sobs)

39:13.936 --> 39:16.052
(snarling )

39:20.108 --> 39:23.020
( gunshot echoes)

39:53.016 --> 39:55.052
(walkers snarling )

40:04.528 --> 40:07.019
(growling)

40:07.197 --> 40:09.688
( gunshots)

40:40.731 --> 40:43.222
- Hershel!
- You didn't find them?

40:43.400 --> 40:45.231
Glenn: We thought maybe
they came back out here.

40:47.195 --> 40:50.733
- What about T? Carol?
- They didn't make it.

40:50.907 --> 40:53.944
That doesn't mean the others didn't.
We're going back.

40:54.119 --> 40:56.075
- Daryl and Glenn, you come with--
-( infant crying)

41:26.943 --> 41:28.604
(sobs)

41:32.866 --> 41:35.323
Where-- where is she?
Where is she?

41:38.455 --> 41:40.070
No... Rick, no!

41:42.084 --> 41:44.917
(sobs)

41:47.130 --> 41:50.418
Oh, no. No!

41:53.011 --> 41:55.673
(sobs)
No!

42:01.603 --> 42:03.810
(sobs)

42:09.611 --> 42:12.478
Oh!
( stammers )

42:12.656 --> 42:16.399
(sobbing )
