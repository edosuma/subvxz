WEBVTT

00:01.933 --> 00:04.200
- ALL RIGHT, SEE YOU LATER.

00:04.200 --> 00:06.367
- OKAY. HAVE FUN DRIVING
YOUR LITTLE SCOOTERS.

00:06.367 --> 00:08.333
- THEY'RE NOT
SCOOTERS, OKAY?

00:08.333 --> 00:09.733
THEY'RE PROFESSIONAL
GO-KARTS.

00:09.733 --> 00:13.167
YOU KNOW--YOU KNOW
THEY'RE GO-KARTS.

00:16.067 --> 00:19.033
- LOOK, DON'T GET MAD AT ME.
ANDY'S THE ONE WHO WANTS TO GO.

00:19.033 --> 00:20.933
HE'S ALL EXCITED ABOUT IT.
I DON'T WANT TO GO.

00:20.933 --> 00:23.867
- RAY, I HEARD YOU MAKING
"VROOM, VROOM" NOISES

00:23.867 --> 00:26.300
IN THE BATHROOM.

00:26.300 --> 00:28.667
- WHAT ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME
IN THERE FOR?

00:28.667 --> 00:31.733
READ A BOOK.

00:31.733 --> 00:33.633
- HEY, GOOD NEWS, RAYMOND.

00:33.633 --> 00:35.767
THEY HAD "THE MEAT LOVERS
PIZZA SPECIAL" TODAY.

00:35.767 --> 00:37.033
YOU ORDER ONE MEAT-LOVERS,

00:37.033 --> 00:40.700
YOU GET ANOTHER FREE
MEAT-LOVERS.

00:40.700 --> 00:42.400
- YOU KNOW, AFTER BREAKING UP
WITH AMY,

00:42.400 --> 00:43.967
I KNOW YOU
SWORE OFF WOMEN.

00:43.967 --> 00:47.033
BUT I DON'T THINK TURNING
TO MEAT IS THE ANSWER.

00:47.033 --> 00:48.933
- VERY FUNNY.
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

00:48.933 --> 00:51.100
I GOT SIDE SALADS
AND WINGS TOO--

00:51.100 --> 00:53.033
ALL FOR THE BIG GAME.
ALL RIGHT?

00:53.033 --> 00:54.700
SO FIRE UP
THE SATELLITE,

00:54.700 --> 00:57.100
BECAUSE THE FOOD'S GONNA
BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

01:00.100 --> 01:01.467
- OH, MAN.

01:01.467 --> 01:03.867
ROBERT, I COMPLETELY FORGOT
ABOUT THIS.

01:03.867 --> 01:05.933
ME AND ANDY, WE...

01:05.933 --> 01:08.067
GOT TO GO TO WORK.

01:10.133 --> 01:13.400
- WHAT, ON--ON A SATURDAY?

01:13.400 --> 01:15.467
- YEAH, SATURDAY,
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

01:15.467 --> 01:18.033
WE LOST OUR COLUMNS
IN THE COMPUTER.

01:18.033 --> 01:19.400
APPARENTLY, SOME JANITOR,

01:19.400 --> 01:22.567
HE SPILLED COFFEE
ON THE MOTHERBOARD.

01:30.333 --> 01:32.400
- ALL RIGHT.
OKAY, WELL...

01:32.400 --> 01:34.200
YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE'LL DO IT
NEXT WEEK, HUH?

01:34.200 --> 01:36.000
- YEAH. DEFINITELY.
NEXT WEEK.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.900
DON'T EVEN TRY TO GET OUT OF IT.
WE'RE DOING THIS NEXT WEEK.

01:38.900 --> 01:40.267
- OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

01:40.267 --> 01:41.933
LOOK, YOU MIND
IF I USE YOUR PHONE?

01:41.933 --> 01:44.167
- NO, NO. GO AHEAD.

01:46.600 --> 01:48.700
- WHY CAN'T ROBERT GO
WITH YOU?

01:48.700 --> 01:49.800
- YEAH, RIGHT.

01:49.800 --> 01:51.233
WHY DON'T I BRING YOU TOO?

02:07.700 --> 02:08.967
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

02:08.967 --> 02:13.400
- THAT BOOK IS BORING.

02:13.400 --> 02:17.733
- OH, YOU SHOULD READ
MORE OFTEN.

02:17.733 --> 02:19.400
[knocking on door]

02:19.400 --> 02:20.533
- RAY!

02:20.533 --> 02:22.233
HEY, RAY!

02:22.233 --> 02:24.067
ARE YOU UPSTAIRS?

02:24.067 --> 02:27.367
- YEAH, BUT WE'RE READING!

02:27.367 --> 02:28.667
- RAY!

02:32.633 --> 02:33.967
- DAD?

02:33.967 --> 02:35.700
- LET'S GO.
YOUR BROTHER'S IN THE HOSPITAL.

02:35.700 --> 02:37.300
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

02:37.300 --> 02:39.133
- I DON'T KNOW.
HE'S IN THE HOSPITAL.

02:39.133 --> 02:40.600
QUEENS HOSPITAL.
- BUT WHY?

02:40.600 --> 02:42.267
- HE WAS ON DUTY,
HE GOT HURT.

02:42.267 --> 02:43.467
THAT'S ALL
THEY WOULD TELL ME.

02:43.467 --> 02:45.133
LET'S GO.
- OH, MY GOD.

02:45.133 --> 02:47.933
- MRS. SCARPULA'S COMING OVER.
SHE'LL WATCH THE KIDS.

02:47.933 --> 02:49.833
I'LL MEET YOU AT THE CAR.

02:49.833 --> 02:51.667
- OH, MY GOD.
ROBERT.

02:54.867 --> 02:56.467
ROBERT?
- OH, MY BABY.

02:56.467 --> 03:00.333
OH, ROBBIE.
- HI, MA.

03:00.333 --> 03:01.533
- HOW ARE YOU DOING, SON?

03:01.533 --> 03:03.100
- ARE YOU OKAY?
WHAT HAPPENED?

03:03.100 --> 03:05.100
YOU LOOK OKAY.
- YEAH, I'LL BE FINE.

03:05.100 --> 03:07.533
- OH, ROBERT. OH.
- DEBRA, BE CAREFUL.

03:07.533 --> 03:09.133
- ARE YOU OKAY?
I DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT YOU.

03:09.133 --> 03:11.333
- NO, NO, I'M OKAY.
HUGGING IS FINE.

03:11.333 --> 03:14.833
- OH, GOOD.
OH.

03:14.833 --> 03:17.867
- OH!
- WHAT HAPPENED?

03:17.867 --> 03:18.967
WERE YOU SHOT?
- NO.

03:18.967 --> 03:20.367
- SWITCHBLADE?
- NO.

03:20.367 --> 03:22.833
- WHO DID THIS?
TELL ME WHO DID THIS TO YOU.

03:22.833 --> 03:23.967
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO, MA?

03:23.967 --> 03:27.333
- YOU'D BE SURPRISED.

03:27.333 --> 03:28.967
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
BACK IT UP.

03:28.967 --> 03:30.300
LET'S BACK IT UP
A LITTLE.

03:30.300 --> 03:31.800
SOME GUYS WERE
RUNNING A RODEO,

03:31.800 --> 03:33.367
AND WE GOT THE CALL
TO SHUT 'EM DOWN.

03:33.367 --> 03:35.100
- WAIT A MINUTE.
RODEO?

03:35.100 --> 03:38.700
WHAT IS THAT,
POLICE TALK FOR WHOREHOUSE?

03:38.700 --> 03:44.433
- NO, IT WAS A REAL RODEO,
A ROOTIN'-TOOTIN' RODEO.

03:44.433 --> 03:46.700
- IN NEW YORK?
- IN QUEENS.

03:46.700 --> 03:48.133
IT WAS AN ILLEGAL RODEO.

03:48.133 --> 03:49.833
SEE, THESE GUYS SET 'EM UP
IN PARKING LOTS

03:49.833 --> 03:52.067
WITH ANIMALS, RIDES, MUSIC.

03:52.067 --> 03:54.500
- THIS CITY'S GOT EVERYTHING.

03:56.233 --> 03:58.067
- SO WE ROLL IN,
AND EVERYONE SCATTERS.

03:58.067 --> 03:59.467
WE WERE RUNNING
AFTER THEM,

03:59.467 --> 04:01.567
AND THEN WE REALIZED
SOME OF THE ANIMALS

04:01.567 --> 04:04.367
WERE HEADING DOWN
QUEENS BOULEVARD.

04:04.367 --> 04:07.133
- SO I TOOK OFF
AFTER THE HORSES.

04:07.133 --> 04:09.467
- YOU ALWAYS WANTED
A PONY.

04:11.333 --> 04:13.167
- ALL RIGHT, MA.
NOBODY CARES ABOUT THAT.

04:13.167 --> 04:14.367
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

04:14.367 --> 04:16.767
- WELL, THE HORSES
WERE TOO FAST,

04:16.767 --> 04:18.533
SO I GAVE UP.

04:18.533 --> 04:21.333
AND THEN I HEAR,
BA-BOOM, BA-BOOM.

04:21.333 --> 04:25.200
AND I LOOK OVER...
AND THERE HE IS.

04:25.200 --> 04:28.733
- WHO?
- A BULL.

04:28.733 --> 04:30.200
- A BULL?

04:30.200 --> 04:32.133
- YUP, A BIG OL' BULL.

04:34.233 --> 04:35.767
HE WAS TIED
TO A TELEPHONE POLE,

04:35.767 --> 04:37.167
BUT HE BROKE LOOSE.

04:37.167 --> 04:39.500
- AND THEN HE STARTED
HEADING RIGHT FOR JUDY.

04:39.500 --> 04:40.867
- OH, MY GOD.

04:40.867 --> 04:42.133
- WELL, WHAT HAPPENED?

04:42.133 --> 04:46.267
- WELL, I YELLED,
"HEY! HEY! BULL!"

04:47.267 --> 04:48.700
AND I DON'T KNOW.

04:48.700 --> 04:53.700
I GUESS I DISTRACTED HIM,
BECAUSE HE STOPPED COLD.

04:53.700 --> 04:56.633
AND THEN HE TURNED...

04:56.633 --> 04:59.367
AND THEN HE STARTED
COMING FOR ME.

04:59.367 --> 05:01.267
- OH, NO.
- OH, YEAH.

05:01.267 --> 05:03.333
IT WAS LIKE THAT WALL STREET AD.

05:03.333 --> 05:05.600
- OR THAT MALT LIQUOR
COMMERCIAL.

05:05.600 --> 05:08.933
- SO HE'S COMING
TOWARDS ME, RIGHT?

05:08.933 --> 05:10.500
- DID YOU GET AWAY?

05:26.833 --> 05:29.933
- WHERE ARE WE, MA?

05:29.933 --> 05:32.533
- OH! OH, MY GOD.

05:32.533 --> 05:35.733
- I'M TELLING YOU,
THE GROUND, IT SHOOK.

05:35.733 --> 05:37.233
- WHY DIDN'T YOU RUN?

05:42.100 --> 05:44.167
- I DID RUN, DAD.

05:44.167 --> 05:47.300
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN
IN THIS SITUATION BEFORE,

05:47.300 --> 05:51.100
BUT THE FIRST THING
THAT COMES TO MIND IS "RUN."

05:54.000 --> 05:55.367
SO I'M RUNNING
AND RUNNING,

05:55.367 --> 05:57.500
AND HE'S GETTING
CLOSER AND CLOSER.

05:57.500 --> 05:59.133
AND THEN HIS HORN
GETS ME.

05:59.133 --> 06:00.567
- [gasps]

06:00.567 --> 06:01.933
- AND MY FEET
ARE OFF THE GROUND

06:01.933 --> 06:04.133
LIKE--LIKE I'M FLYING.

06:04.133 --> 06:07.467
INCREDIBLY PAINFUL FLYING.

06:07.467 --> 06:10.367
AND THEN HE TOSSES ME ASIDE
LIKE A SOCK.

06:10.367 --> 06:11.667
AND I'M ON THE PAVEMENT,

06:11.667 --> 06:14.167
AND HE GIVES ME
A COUPLE OF SNORTS

06:14.167 --> 06:17.300
AND LUMBERS UP THE RAMP
AND INTO HIS TRAILER.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.467
- UNBELIEVABLE.

06:21.467 --> 06:22.967
YOU WERE GORED.

06:22.967 --> 06:26.500
- BY A FREAKIN' BULL.

06:26.500 --> 06:28.967
HOLY CRAP.

06:28.967 --> 06:30.333
- BUT WHERE DID HE GET YOU?

06:30.333 --> 06:33.067
- IN MY ADDUCTOR MAGNUS.

06:33.067 --> 06:34.233
- YOUR WHAT?

06:34.233 --> 06:41.000
- IT'S MY UPPER THIGH AREA.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.633
- SOUNDS LIKE HE GOT YOU
IN THE ASS.

06:44.633 --> 06:48.067
I'M NOT--I'M NOT LAUGHING.

06:48.067 --> 06:49.400
IT'S HORRIBLE.
IT'S HORRIBLE.

06:49.400 --> 06:50.800
I'M NOT LAUGHING.

06:50.800 --> 06:53.233
- IT'S "UPPER THIGH."

06:53.233 --> 06:55.633
- OH, I HATE ALL
THIS POLICE BUSINESS.

06:55.633 --> 06:57.767
I ALWAYS KNEW
I'D GET THIS CALL.

06:57.767 --> 06:59.433
- REALLY?

06:59.433 --> 07:02.633
THE "YOUR SON HAS BEEN GORED
IN THE ASS BY A BULL" CALL?

07:05.833 --> 07:07.867
- IT'S UPPER THIGH.

07:07.867 --> 07:09.700
- YOUR JOB
IS SO DANGEROUS.

07:09.700 --> 07:11.800
THEY SHOULD'VE
PREPARED YOU BETTER.

07:11.800 --> 07:13.433
- YEAH, THEY SHOULD'VE
STARTED YOU OUT

07:13.433 --> 07:17.033
AS ONE OF THOSE CLOWNS
IN THE BARREL.

07:17.033 --> 07:18.767
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
ENOUGH ALREADY.

07:18.767 --> 07:20.367
THIS IS A SERIOUS INJURY.

07:20.367 --> 07:23.633
AND I DON'T SEE YOU TAKING
A BULL FOR YOUR PARTNER.

07:25.033 --> 07:26.467
- HELLO.

07:26.467 --> 07:29.333
OFFICER BARONE,
I JUST NEED TO CHECK YOUR IV.

07:30.433 --> 07:33.233
- WHAT?
WHAT? WHAT?

07:33.233 --> 07:34.500
- DO YOU REALIZE,

07:34.500 --> 07:36.767
IN A GROUP THAT INCLUDES
YOUR FATHER,

07:36.767 --> 07:39.967
YOU'RE BEING
THE MOST INSENSITIVE?

07:39.967 --> 07:43.767
- YEAH, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S WRONG WITH DAD.

07:43.767 --> 07:46.067
HE MUST BE TIRED.

07:46.067 --> 07:49.267
COME ON, HE'S OKAY.

07:49.267 --> 07:50.933
LAUGHTER'S THE BEST
MEDICINE, RIGHT?

07:50.933 --> 07:54.900
I'M KEEPING IT LOOSE.
I'M KEEPING IT LIGHT.

07:54.900 --> 07:58.400
- HOW ABOUT KEEPING IT SHUT?

07:58.400 --> 08:00.767
- SEE, YOU'RE FUNNY.
YOU SHOULD GET IN THERE WITH ME.

08:02.200 --> 08:03.667
- PRETTY LUCKY.

08:03.667 --> 08:05.467
IF YOU'RE GONNA SUSTAIN
A PUNCTURE WOUND,

08:05.467 --> 08:08.567
THE BEST PLACE IS ACTUALLY
A FLESHY AREA LIKE THE RUMP.

08:08.567 --> 08:10.000
- [laughs]

08:12.000 --> 08:15.567
- YOU KNOW, I, UH--
I'M GETTING A LITTLE TIRED.

08:15.567 --> 08:18.300
I REALLY THINK THAT'S
ENOUGH VISITING FOR TODAY.

08:18.300 --> 08:20.067
- ALL RIGHT.
YOU REST, SWEETHEART.

08:20.067 --> 08:22.067
- OKAY. SEE YOU TOMORROW.

08:22.067 --> 08:24.167
- ALL RIGHT THERE, SON.

08:24.167 --> 08:26.600
TAKE IT EASY.

08:26.600 --> 08:27.767
GOOD JOB.

08:31.667 --> 08:33.533
- [groans]

08:33.533 --> 08:35.633
- DON'T TRY
AND MOVE SO MUCH.

08:35.633 --> 08:37.700
- I'LL BE BACK
A LITTLE LATER, ROBERT.

08:37.700 --> 08:40.567
THIS'LL TEACH YOU TO PICK UP
AN EXTRA SHIFT, HUH?

08:40.567 --> 08:42.100
- YEAH, REALLY.

08:42.100 --> 08:43.533
ALL RIGHT, I'LL SEE
YOU GUYS, HUH?

08:43.533 --> 08:45.967
- WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, EXTRA SHIFT?

08:45.967 --> 08:48.667
- WELL, HE SAID YOU HAD TO WORK,
SO HE CAME IN EARLY.

08:48.667 --> 08:51.000
SEE YOU.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.967
- OKAY, WE'LL SEE YOU, ROBERT.
YOU FEEL BETTER, OKAY?

08:52.967 --> 08:54.733
- OKAY.
THANKS, DEB.

08:54.733 --> 08:58.600
- YEAH, YEAH, FEEL BETTER,
ALL RIGHT, ROBERT?

09:01.867 --> 09:03.067
OH, MY GOD.

09:03.067 --> 09:04.567
- WHAT?
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

09:04.567 --> 09:06.833
- IT'S ALL MY FAULT.
IT'S MY FAULT.

09:06.833 --> 09:09.600
- THE STUPID GO-KARTS.

09:09.600 --> 09:11.133
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE,

09:11.133 --> 09:14.467
I'M GONNA HAVE ROBERT'S ASS
HANGING OVER MY HEAD.

09:19.800 --> 09:22.167
- ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GET BACK TO BED NOW.

09:22.167 --> 09:25.467
- OW, OW, OW, OW! OW!

09:25.467 --> 09:28.667
I'M HATING THIS.
I'M HATING THIS!

09:30.633 --> 09:32.467
- HEY, ROBERT.

09:37.767 --> 09:40.200
HOW YOU DOIN'?

09:40.200 --> 09:42.233
- GOOD.
I'M DOING GREAT, RAYMOND.

09:42.233 --> 09:45.367
I WAS JUST SHOWING HER
A MAGIC TRICK.

09:47.967 --> 09:49.867
- WELL, YOU LOOK GREAT.

09:49.867 --> 09:53.000
AND, HEY, GUESS WHAT?

09:53.000 --> 09:55.600
FROM YOUR PAST,

09:55.600 --> 09:58.733
A SPECIAL, SPECIAL LADY.

09:58.733 --> 10:00.033
- OH, GOD.

10:00.033 --> 10:01.933
- COME ON.

10:01.933 --> 10:03.067
- HI, ROBERT.

10:03.067 --> 10:07.600
- AMY...HI.

10:07.600 --> 10:11.033
- YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M GONNA GET
YOU A BIGGER SEEPAGE PAD.

10:16.067 --> 10:17.767
- THANK YOU.

10:19.567 --> 10:23.333
- ROBERT, I HEARD
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

10:23.333 --> 10:27.000
- YEAH, IT'S NICE
TO SEE YOU AGAIN, AMY.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.700
- YOU TOO.

10:28.700 --> 10:30.067
- I'LL BE BACK LATER.

10:30.067 --> 10:31.533
DON'T FORGET
TO FILL OUT YOUR MENU.

10:31.533 --> 10:33.467
REMEMBER, YOU'RE ON
A SOFT DIET.

10:36.467 --> 10:38.133
- CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG.

10:38.133 --> 10:40.700
SOUNDS TO ME LIKE SOMEONE CAN
HAVE ALL THE SOUP HE WANTS.

10:40.700 --> 10:42.067
HUH?

10:43.733 --> 10:46.433
THERE'S IN THE WORLD
LIKE SOUP.

10:48.167 --> 10:53.900
WELL, STEW.
STEW IS LIKE SOUP.

10:53.900 --> 10:56.100
- SO YOU'RE LOOKING WELL.

10:56.100 --> 10:59.100
- I READ ABOUT YOU
IN THE PAPER.

10:59.100 --> 11:00.633
YOU'RE FAMOUS.

11:00.633 --> 11:04.267

11:05.767 --> 11:08.733
THE ANIMAL RIGHTS PEOPLE
SENT ROBERT A THANK YOU

11:08.733 --> 11:13.267
FOR THE HUMANE WAY
THAT HE STOPPED THE BULL.

11:13.267 --> 11:16.267
- ALL RIGHT, RAYMOND.

11:16.267 --> 11:19.100
LOOK, AMY, IT WAS NICE OF YOU
TO STOP BY.

11:19.100 --> 11:21.333
- OH, OKAY.

11:21.333 --> 11:23.900
I GUESS YOU SHOULD
GET YOUR REST.

11:23.900 --> 11:26.733
GET BETTER, ALL RIGHT?
- THAT'S WHAT I'M HERE FOR.

11:32.067 --> 11:36.067
- THAT WAS GREAT
SEEING AMY AGAIN, HUH?

11:36.067 --> 11:37.633
- YEAH.

11:37.633 --> 11:39.400
ONCE WE STOPPED DATING,
I WAS WORRIED

11:39.400 --> 11:42.633
I WOULDN'T GET TO BE HUMILIATED
IN FRONT OF HER ANYMORE.

11:45.233 --> 11:48.167
- SO I HEARD YOU'RE--YOU'RE
PACKING UP AND GOING HOME SOON.

11:48.167 --> 11:49.367
THAT'S GOOD.

11:49.367 --> 11:51.100
- I'M NOT GOING HOME.

11:51.100 --> 11:53.367
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WHY NOT?

11:53.367 --> 11:55.133
- I CAN BARELY HOBBLE, RAY.

11:55.133 --> 11:57.133
I CAN'T TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

11:57.133 --> 12:00.033
I HAVE TO MOVE IN
WITH MOM AND DAD TOMORROW.

12:00.033 --> 12:03.600
- OH, GOD.

12:03.600 --> 12:06.200
- THAT'S RIGHT.

12:06.200 --> 12:07.767
- HEY, COME ON, CHEER UP.

12:09.600 --> 12:12.067
COME ON, CHEER UP.

[snorts]

12:32.167 --> 12:35.000
ALL RIGHT.
LOOK...

12:35.000 --> 12:36.767
I GOT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

12:40.200 --> 12:42.667
WHEN YOU TOOK THE EXTRA SHIFT

12:42.667 --> 12:46.500
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WATCH
THE BALL GAME WITH YOU,

12:46.500 --> 12:48.300
I KNOW THAT YOU THOUGHT
I HAD TO GO TO WORK.

12:48.300 --> 12:51.633
BUT, SEE, I KIND OF FORGOT
THAT WE HAD PLANS,

12:51.633 --> 12:54.400
AND I DIDN'T WANT
TO HURT YOUR FEELINGS,

12:54.400 --> 12:58.000
SO I-I TOLD YOU
I HAD TO WORK.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.233
BUT REALLY...

13:00.233 --> 13:03.733
I WENT WITH ANDY
TO DRIVE GO-KARTS.

13:05.933 --> 13:07.767
- WHY ARE YOU
TELLING ME THIS?

13:07.767 --> 13:10.200
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

13:10.200 --> 13:12.033
I FEEL BAD.
I WANT YOU TO KNOW.

13:12.033 --> 13:14.400
- YOU WANT ME TO KNOW THAT.
- YEAH.

13:14.400 --> 13:18.100
YEAH, AND TO GIVE YOU
THIS "GET WELL SOON" CARD.

13:18.100 --> 13:19.400
YEAH, SEE?

13:19.400 --> 13:22.400
THE MONKEY SLIPPED
ON THE BANANA.

13:25.000 --> 13:29.133
I GOT IT 'CAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE
HE HURT HIS UPPER THIGH.

13:38.633 --> 13:41.567
- SO YOU WANT TO MAKE ME
FEEL BETTER.

13:41.567 --> 13:43.367
- OF COURSE I DO.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

13:43.367 --> 13:45.800
- I THINK YOU WANT
TO MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.

13:45.800 --> 13:47.033
- WHAT?

13:47.033 --> 13:48.300
- ALL THIS, RAY--

13:48.300 --> 13:51.267
YOUR LITTLE TELETHON HERE,

13:51.267 --> 13:53.100
THE BALLOONS,
AND THE GUEST STARS.

13:53.100 --> 13:55.133
THIS IS BECAUSE
YOU FEEL GUILTY.

13:55.133 --> 13:56.767
AND THEN BY TELLING ME
THAT YOU DUMPED ME

13:56.767 --> 13:59.433
SO YOU COULD SIT
IN A BUMPER CAR WITH ANDY,

13:59.433 --> 14:02.567
HOW'S THAT SUPPOSED
TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER? HUH?

14:04.567 --> 14:06.067
- GO-KART.

14:09.667 --> 14:12.333
- WELL, AS LONG
AS YOU FEEL BETTER.

14:12.333 --> 14:13.933
GOOD NIGHT, RAYMOND.

14:13.933 --> 14:15.467
- ALL RIGHT.
WELL, LISTEN--

14:15.467 --> 14:19.400
- I SAID, GOOD NIGHT.
- BUT I DON'T FEEL--

14:22.133 --> 14:24.900
COME ON, ROBERT.

14:24.900 --> 14:27.100
ROBERT, COME ON.

14:28.333 --> 14:31.567
ROBERT, YOU CAN'T DO THIS HERE.

14:31.567 --> 14:33.500
OKAY, YOU'RE GONNA END UP
IN THE BASEMENT

14:33.500 --> 14:35.367
WITH A TAG
ON YOUR TOE.

14:39.167 --> 14:40.700
I'M TELLING YOU,
I DID WHAT YOU SAID.

14:40.700 --> 14:43.100
I WENT OVER THERE,
I GAVE HIM COMPASSION,

14:43.100 --> 14:44.633
TOLD HIM HOW I FELT.

14:44.633 --> 14:46.067
MADE IT WORSE.

14:46.067 --> 14:47.733
NICE GOIN'.

14:49.767 --> 14:53.067
- AND HOW EXACTLY DID YOU SHOW
YOUR COMPASSION?

14:53.067 --> 14:56.233
- WITH BALLOONS.

14:56.233 --> 14:58.567
- DID YOU TELL HIM
THAT YOU CARE ABOUT HIM?

14:58.567 --> 15:01.567
- IT SAID IT ON THE BALLOON:
"YOU'RE NUMBER ONE!"

15:01.567 --> 15:04.100
- WHY DON'T YOU TRY ACTUALLY
TELLING HIM

15:04.100 --> 15:05.733
THAT YOU CARE ABOUT HIM?

15:05.733 --> 15:09.167
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK, DON'T GET
ALL GIRLIE ON ME, OKAY?

15:09.167 --> 15:10.600
HE'S MY BROTHER.

15:10.600 --> 15:11.933
- HE DOESN'T KNOW
THAT YOU CARE ABOUT HIM.

15:11.933 --> 15:13.267
- HE KNOWS.

15:13.267 --> 15:14.767
HE KNOWS I WOULD DO
ANYTHING FOR HIM.

15:14.767 --> 15:17.600
- YEAH, AND HE KNOWS
BECAUSE YOU DUMPED HIM FOR ANDY?

15:17.600 --> 15:20.433
BECAUSE YOU TOLD HIM
YOU DUMPED HIM FOR ANDY?

15:20.433 --> 15:22.667
OR BECAUSE YOU FEEL BAD
THAT HE'S MAD AT YOU

15:22.667 --> 15:24.700
FOR TELLING HIM
THAT YOU DUMPED HIM FOR ANDY?

15:28.400 --> 15:33.233
- FIRST OF ALL, NOBODY LIKES
A MOCK MULTIPLE-CHOICE.

15:36.467 --> 15:41.700
AND THEREFORE, THERE WILL
BE NO "SECOND OF ALL."

15:49.233 --> 15:50.633

I THINK IT'S CLEVER.

16:55.933 --> 16:58.233
- EH, IT'S JUST HEADLINES.

16:58.233 --> 17:00.467
NOBODY READS THAT, REALLY.

17:06.133 --> 17:08.133
DO YOU WANT
ANYTHING ELSE, DEAR?

17:08.133 --> 17:10.500
- MY DIGNITY.

17:10.500 --> 17:13.600

WITH THE BODY IN GENERAL.

I PREFER IT TO REMAIN
A WONDROUS MYSTERY.

YOU TO, RAYMOND.

FOR NOT CHANGING ENOUGH DIAPERS.

DO IT OR NOT?

19:25.000 --> 19:28.400
- YEAH. YEAH.
WHAT DO I DO?

19:28.400 --> 19:32.967

CHRISTMAS MORNING...
