00:11.653 --> 00:13.070
<i>The look of envy...</i>

00:13.105 --> 00:16.641
<i>It was a look Dalia was</i>
<i>well-accustomed to receiving.</i>

00:16.692 --> 00:18.526
<i>Me... not so much...</i>

00:18.560 --> 00:19.694
Pick you up after school?

00:19.728 --> 00:20.995
Okay.
<i>Until now.</i>

00:21.029 --> 00:22.213
Nose kiss?

00:23.949 --> 00:27.785
<i>Scott Strauss had chosen</i> me
<i>over Dalia, and it was big.</i>

00:27.836 --> 00:29.170
Bye.

00:29.204 --> 00:30.171
Bye.

00:30.666 --> 00:32.734
<i>No. It was huge.</i>

00:34.303 --> 00:37.371
It's like New York
all over again.

00:37.389 --> 00:40.608
The problem didn't go away.
It just got bigger.

00:40.643 --> 00:42.076
That was a reference
to Scott's...

00:42.111 --> 00:44.379
Correct.

00:44.413 --> 00:46.848
Your daughter has
a voracious sexual appetite.

00:46.882 --> 00:49.817
She's got a hunger for the flesh
that can't be satiated.

00:49.835 --> 00:51.453
You have a daughter.
How can you joke like this?

00:51.487 --> 00:54.923
Because she's
not sexually active.

00:54.957 --> 00:58.159
She's an academic...
Like her mother.

00:58.193 --> 00:59.193
I know it's not my choice.

00:59.211 --> 01:01.362
I just don't want Tessa
to treat sex

01:01.397 --> 01:03.448
as a recreational hobby.

01:03.482 --> 01:05.617
Well,
have you told her that?

01:05.651 --> 01:07.569
I... tried to.

01:11.323 --> 01:12.657
What am I supposed
to do now?

01:12.691 --> 01:14.159
I can't keep relocating her

01:14.193 --> 01:16.478
every time
I find condoms, can I?

01:16.512 --> 01:19.898
I mean, I could.
We have the miles.

01:29.909 --> 01:32.327
<i>Namaste,</i> you guys.

01:32.361 --> 01:35.497
I just had
a <i>tantric</i> mani-pedi.

01:35.499 --> 01:39.584
Uh, moon over Miami Vice
versa my favorite song?

01:39.618 --> 01:40.635
How did you know?

01:40.669 --> 01:41.636
I know.

01:41.670 --> 01:43.755
H. It was orgasmic.

01:43.789 --> 01:45.423
That is the problem
with Chatswin.

01:45.457 --> 01:47.675
Everything out here has
to be sexualized.

01:47.710 --> 01:50.144
George is angry
about his daughter's libido.

01:50.179 --> 01:52.213
Dalia got horny early,

01:52.247 --> 01:54.215
so we had the sex talk
<i>years</i> ago.

01:54.249 --> 01:55.717
I wouldn't wait, George.

01:55.751 --> 01:57.101
To have the sex talk?

01:57.136 --> 01:58.953
Yeah, I think Tessa knows
where babies come from.

01:58.988 --> 02:00.638
I'm not talking about
that sex talk.

02:00.689 --> 02:02.056
I'm talking about the one
where you explain

02:02.090 --> 02:04.108
all the different kinds
of sex.

02:04.143 --> 02:06.027
- Different kinds of...
- Breakup, makeup,

02:06.061 --> 02:08.279
girl-on-girl,
group-on-guy...

02:08.314 --> 02:12.367
Hate sex, date sex, pity sex,
party sex, pity party sex.

02:12.401 --> 02:14.335
- Bi-curious, by the ocean...
- By the hour.

02:14.370 --> 02:15.904
The reverse Andre the giant.

02:15.938 --> 02:17.322
No. Tessa is not doing
any of that.

02:17.373 --> 02:19.941
Well, she's going to,
if she hasn't already, George,

02:19.959 --> 02:21.409
and you can't stop her.

02:21.443 --> 02:23.161
I sure can. It's simple.

02:23.212 --> 02:25.623
If I want to keep
Tessa away from boys,

02:25.624 --> 02:29.300
all I have to do is find something
more fun than having sex.

02:29.335 --> 02:31.386
Jenga!

02:31.420 --> 02:32.604
<i> You take
a block from the bottom </i>

02:32.638 --> 02:33.771
<i> and you put it on top</i>

02:33.806 --> 02:35.023
<i> you take
a block from the middle </i>

02:35.057 --> 02:36.958
<i> and you put it on top</i>

02:38.349 --> 02:40.384
Well, we've got other games.

02:40.425 --> 02:44.027
You guys ready for a good
old-fashioned game night, or what?

02:44.062 --> 02:45.746
I cut my teeth
on chutes and ladders,

02:45.797 --> 02:48.932
or "Snakes and ladders,"
as it's called on the streets,

02:48.966 --> 02:51.084
but, I'm up
for anything.

02:51.135 --> 02:53.503
I was under the impression
that Tessa would be here.

02:53.538 --> 02:54.838
Yeah, we're gonna surprise her.

02:54.872 --> 02:58.425
Hungry hungry hippos, Life,
Yahtzee, Connect 4...

02:58.476 --> 02:59.643
What about Monopoly?

02:59.677 --> 03:00.644
You're a purist.

03:00.678 --> 03:02.429
Respect, but I gotta be
the boot.

03:02.480 --> 03:03.930
Surprise!

03:06.651 --> 03:09.603
Surprise...
You're hanging out

03:09.637 --> 03:11.705
with my friends
when I'm not home?

03:13.091 --> 03:14.174
Yep.

03:14.225 --> 03:16.560
For the record,
I said this was weird.

03:16.594 --> 03:18.061
Dad,
this is Scott Strauss.

03:18.079 --> 03:20.831
Hello, Scott.
You... you play Yahtzee?

03:20.865 --> 03:21.798
You said
we were playing Monopoly.

03:21.833 --> 03:23.033
I just set up the bank.

03:23.067 --> 03:24.368
Actually, Scott and I have
dinner plans, so...

03:24.402 --> 03:27.604
Okay. "Dinner plans."
"Scott and I."

03:27.638 --> 03:30.374
"Actually."
How grown-up.

03:30.408 --> 03:31.408
Scott, can you wait
outside?

03:31.442 --> 03:33.143
I think my dad's having
a stroke.

03:33.161 --> 03:35.112
Sure thing.
Nice meeting you, Mr. Altman.

03:35.146 --> 03:36.113
- Yes, very nice meeting you, too.
- Hey.

03:36.147 --> 03:37.948
Get it.

03:37.982 --> 03:40.183
What was that?

03:40.218 --> 03:41.218
What was what?

03:41.252 --> 03:43.253
What did you just tell him
to get?

03:43.287 --> 03:44.354
Dad, what is wrong
with you?

03:44.389 --> 03:45.889
- What's wrong with <i>you?</i>
- Nothing.

03:45.923 --> 03:48.425
I'm behaving
very normally. It's Friday.

03:48.459 --> 03:51.094
I'm going on an age-appropriate
date with a cute boy.

03:51.129 --> 03:54.064

pictionary with minors.

04:09.441 --> 04:11.876
<i>as stale</i>

04:11.911 --> 04:14.562
<i>All the kid ever talked about</i>

04:14.597 --> 04:16.297

04:16.332 --> 04:18.399
I wish I could have
taken you for <i>bambara.</i>

04:18.434 --> 04:20.301
It's this dish I used to eat
when I was living in...

04:20.336 --> 04:22.036
Let me guess it. Zambia?

04:22.071 --> 04:23.655
 Yeah.

04:23.689 --> 04:25.540
Too bad we can't have it,

04:25.574 --> 04:28.209
'cause we're not in Zambia.

04:28.244 --> 04:30.778
We're in... Chatswin.

04:30.813 --> 04:32.080
I know that.
Do you?

04:32.114 --> 04:33.381
Yeah.

04:33.415 --> 04:36.417
In Zambia in the summertime,
it gets surprisingly cold.

04:36.452 --> 04:38.152
Did you ever see...

04:38.169 --> 04:39.670
this Internet video

04:39.704 --> 04:43.507
of this kid coming home
from the dentist

04:43.541 --> 04:45.575
after he has had
too much anesthesia?

04:45.610 --> 04:46.710
No.

04:46.744 --> 04:49.846
It's funny.
I <i>love</i> funny stuff.

04:49.881 --> 04:53.483
You?

04:53.518 --> 04:55.419
Yeah.

04:55.453 --> 04:56.920
It's just hard to laugh,
you know,

04:56.955 --> 04:58.822
when you know that
people are starving...

05:01.375 --> 05:02.809
In Zambia.

05:04.545 --> 05:06.078
Are you gonna finish that?

05:06.096 --> 05:07.613
I will now. Yeah.

05:07.648 --> 05:09.582
I'm thinking about
going back next summer.

05:09.616 --> 05:12.085
You should.
You should go.

05:12.119 --> 05:13.753
Is everything okay, Tessa?

05:13.787 --> 05:15.388
<i>No. Everything was</i> not <i>okay.</i>

05:15.422 --> 05:18.424
<i>I was sick of hearing</i>
<i>about Scott's one adventure,</i>

05:18.458 --> 05:20.226
<i>and I probably would have</i>
<i>dumped him at that very moment,</i>

05:20.260 --> 05:21.594
<i>had it not been for the war</i>

05:21.612 --> 05:22.979
<i>i was waging against Dalia.</i>

05:23.013 --> 05:24.597
Kiss me, Scott.

05:24.631 --> 05:26.732
Kiss me like I'm Africa.

05:35.576 --> 05:36.709
Buy a hotel.

05:36.743 --> 05:38.511
We will.

05:39.913 --> 05:41.013
We <i>will!</i>

05:41.048 --> 05:43.182
Just got another hotel.

05:43.217 --> 05:44.851
Malik's still in jail.

05:44.885 --> 05:45.968
Sorry, Malik.

05:46.003 --> 05:47.820
You don't seem sorry.

05:47.855 --> 05:50.056
Can I top you guys off?

05:50.090 --> 05:51.924
Yes, please.
I never get soda at home.

05:51.942 --> 05:54.494
She's had enough.

05:55.629 --> 05:58.413
Aw, I was rooting for you,
too.

05:58.732 --> 06:02.084
8:45. I was sure Tessa
and Scott would be home by now.

06:05.572 --> 06:07.690
What do you think
they might be doing?

06:07.708 --> 06:09.675
I mean, I mean, you know,

06:09.710 --> 06:11.844
what do you guys
generally do

06:11.879 --> 06:13.880
with your dates?

06:13.914 --> 06:15.948
Well, theoretically,
I would take my lover

06:15.983 --> 06:19.468
up to Mt. Julian and share
a soft cheese from Wisconsin.

06:19.503 --> 06:20.870
They're just as good
as the ones from France

06:20.904 --> 06:22.872
but more affordable.

06:22.906 --> 06:25.341
Then we would sit up there
till the sun came up

06:25.375 --> 06:27.543
and talk about our hopes
and dreams

06:27.578 --> 06:30.112
and "Dancing with the stars."

06:30.147 --> 06:32.248
I'd probably like to go
somewhere dark

06:32.282 --> 06:34.050
- so we could make out.
- Make out.

06:34.084 --> 06:35.935
Yeah. Sure.
I'm down with that?

06:35.969 --> 06:38.688
That's... yeah. Get it.

06:38.722 --> 06:41.090
So what about intercourse?

06:43.660 --> 06:45.995
Can I call my mom
to come get me?

06:46.013 --> 06:49.932
I mean, typically, what age
do kids... partake nowadays?

06:49.967 --> 06:52.501
That's okay, Malik.
I'll answer this one.

06:53.703 --> 06:55.804
Mr. Altman,

06:55.822 --> 06:58.607
the right age depends
on the individual.

06:58.641 --> 07:00.575
And each individual
can determine

07:00.610 --> 07:01.943
what that proper age is

07:01.978 --> 07:04.312
by consulting
the online virginity calculator.

07:04.347 --> 07:07.149
It's not a real thing.

07:07.183 --> 07:09.217
You enter your height, weight,
hair length, and zip code.

07:09.252 --> 07:11.787
It'll tell you
when you're ready. 18.

07:12.905 --> 07:17.092
16. But I can wait.

07:29.689 --> 07:31.456
Come on, 21.

07:33.076 --> 07:34.342
Let's go, 21.

07:34.377 --> 07:38.613
Here we go. 21.

07:41.217 --> 07:42.451
16?

07:42.485 --> 07:44.653
She's 16 right now.

07:48.024 --> 07:50.425
What if I made her
get a haircut?

07:51.911 --> 07:54.796
Thank you so much
for making a house call

07:54.830 --> 07:56.364
to pick up
our dry cleaning.

07:56.399 --> 07:59.351
The club makes everything
so convenient.

07:59.402 --> 08:00.752
Did you know we have
a pediatric urologist

08:00.786 --> 08:01.836
starting next week?

08:01.871 --> 08:04.239
I did not!

08:04.273 --> 08:05.857
Super duper.

08:05.908 --> 08:07.659
Don't forget to check
the pockets.

08:07.710 --> 08:11.796
Let's see if we can't find
some extra tip money for you.

08:14.166 --> 08:15.634
Dear.

08:15.668 --> 08:18.086
Are you kidding me, Javier?

08:18.120 --> 08:19.254
Are you kidding me
right now?

08:19.288 --> 08:20.888
I-I don't know what...

08:20.906 --> 08:24.726
Look at this thing!
It's an m/l! An m/l.

08:24.760 --> 08:27.796
Do you have any idea how many
hours I spend at the gym

08:27.830 --> 08:30.532
keeping it tight so he can
get down with an m/l?!

08:31.667 --> 08:34.269
That is it!
That is the last straw!

08:34.303 --> 08:36.554
It'll all be ready
by Tuesday.

08:36.589 --> 08:39.541
And give me back
them giant panties!

08:53.262 --> 08:55.180
- Morning, dad.
- Hey.

08:55.214 --> 08:57.055
I'm gonna head over to
Lisa's in a minute.

08:57.056 --> 08:57.515
Yeah?

08:57.567 --> 08:59.534
She invited me
to sleep over tonight.

08:59.569 --> 09:01.720
I feel like I haven't
seen you much.

09:01.771 --> 09:04.456
I know, but I feel like
Lisa's feeling neglected

09:04.490 --> 09:06.575
'cause I've been spending
so much time with Scott.

09:08.644 --> 09:09.945
So is it cool?

09:09.979 --> 09:13.248
Yeah. It's cool.

09:13.282 --> 09:14.583
It's very cool.

09:14.617 --> 09:19.020
But... before you go, I...

09:19.055 --> 09:22.156
Thought you'd probably
want these.

09:23.215 --> 09:25.066
I don't think
Lisa and I need those.

09:25.101 --> 09:26.835
I'm returning them to you.
They're yours.

09:26.869 --> 09:28.303
- No, they're not.
- Found 'em in your room.

09:28.337 --> 09:29.303
So you were going
through my room?

09:29.322 --> 09:31.339
No, no, I was in there
to turn off the music,

09:31.374 --> 09:33.841
and then I saw 'em...
In a box...

09:33.859 --> 09:35.043
Which I opened.

09:35.077 --> 09:38.546
So here we are,
back to square one.

09:38.581 --> 09:39.781
I could say the same thing.

09:39.815 --> 09:41.383
George,
those were given to me.

09:41.417 --> 09:42.314
Safe sex fairy?

09:42.315 --> 09:44.586
Why do I even bother?
You know what?

09:44.620 --> 09:46.338
Think what
you wanna think.

09:51.694 --> 09:53.161
Trust me when I tell you
you will regret it

09:53.195 --> 09:54.696
if you have casual sex.

09:54.730 --> 09:56.031
It's not a casual thing.

09:56.065 --> 09:58.583
It's something you share
with the right person.

09:58.617 --> 10:00.635
Is he the right person?

10:02.038 --> 10:04.906
Good-bye George,
I'll see you tomorrow.

10:04.940 --> 10:05.630
Talk to me.

10:05.631 --> 10:08.392
Yeah, well, that's something
you earn, not demand.

10:08.576 --> 10:10.344
- Tessa!
- You treat me like a child!

10:10.378 --> 10:12.262
I do not treat you
like a child!

10:15.200 --> 10:17.851
You forgot your squishy.

10:18.754 --> 10:21.339
Thanks again for coming
in on a Saturday, Aaron.

10:21.390 --> 10:23.724
Please, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

10:23.759 --> 10:25.960
Don't be stupid.

10:25.994 --> 10:27.428
I'd do anything for you,
Dallas.

10:27.462 --> 10:30.031
I mean, you're a client,
but you're also a friend.

10:31.183 --> 10:34.769
And also...
I was coming in anyway.

10:34.803 --> 10:36.370
Steven freaks out
over nothin'.

10:36.405 --> 10:39.073
He freaks out if I wear
my shoes in the house,

10:39.091 --> 10:41.676
but I'm supposed to turn
the other cheek on these?

10:41.710 --> 10:43.877
These panties are
a slap in the face, Aaron.

10:43.895 --> 10:45.012
Look, look,

10:45.046 --> 10:46.097
Steven is not a Saint.

10:46.148 --> 10:48.749
We've been down this road
before.

10:48.784 --> 10:50.618
But he's
an excellent provider.

10:50.652 --> 10:54.071
So you have to ask yourself
this question.

10:54.106 --> 10:55.990
Is this a really big problem

10:56.024 --> 10:58.943
or a you-can-live-with-it
problem?

10:58.994 --> 11:01.529
Is it huge,
or is it just m/l?

11:01.563 --> 11:03.698
Of course, once you
serve him the papers,

11:03.732 --> 11:07.068
the papers
can't be unserved.

11:09.538 --> 11:11.072
Okay.

11:13.074 --> 11:16.310
But I'd like to submit these
into evidence.

11:22.153 --> 11:25.020
- He's just become so controlling.
- Scott?

11:25.033 --> 11:26.066
George.

11:26.378 --> 11:27.711
And that...
that's gotten to the point

11:27.746 --> 11:29.580
where I can't even stand
the sound of his voice.

11:29.614 --> 11:30.981
- George.
- Scott!

11:31.015 --> 11:33.250
Tessa, why don't you just
tell your dad nothing happened

11:33.284 --> 11:34.651
between you and Scott?

11:34.686 --> 11:36.353
Then he'll get off
your case.

11:36.387 --> 11:41.291
No. Too kind.
I want George to sweat it out.

11:41.326 --> 11:44.528
Maybe I'll even fake a pregnancy
like Kenzie did.

11:44.562 --> 11:48.532
Ha! Payback for going
through my room again.

11:48.566 --> 11:52.336
Okay. Sleep on that.

11:54.423 --> 11:55.756
Good night, Tessa.

11:57.059 --> 11:58.359
Good night.

12:03.965 --> 12:07.835
I think Malik made a pass at me
during game night.

12:23.151 --> 12:25.653
Well, the bacon certainly
looks crisp this morning.

12:30.043 --> 12:33.612
It is. It's crisp.

12:33.647 --> 12:35.297
Keep us posted, Fred.

12:35.332 --> 12:36.832
I heard about you
and Scott Strauss.

12:36.867 --> 12:38.801
I just wanna say I approve.

12:38.835 --> 12:41.370
- Shut up, Ryan.
- He has great hair.

12:41.404 --> 12:41.751
Dad.

12:41.752 --> 12:43.138
It doesn't hurt me
to see you with him.

12:43.172 --> 12:44.106
I'm gonna go get
some grapefruit.

12:44.140 --> 12:45.074
Anyone want anything?

12:45.108 --> 12:46.441
I want you back.

12:46.459 --> 12:48.711
I will go get
some muffins for the table.

13:01.258 --> 13:02.458
It's a lot of muffins.

13:02.492 --> 13:03.525
Well, I worked upa pretty bige

13:03.560 --> 13:04.927
after all the sex
I've been having.

13:04.961 --> 13:06.462
Yeah, yeah. Funny.

13:06.496 --> 13:08.464
Who knows?
Maybe I'm eating for two.

13:08.498 --> 13:10.766
I'm thinking Xavier
if it's a boy... or a girl.

13:10.784 --> 13:12.618
Hey, y-you're just being
silly now. Come on, Tessa.

13:12.652 --> 13:14.003
I wasn't going through
your room.

13:14.037 --> 13:16.906
And yet you were going
through my room.

13:16.940 --> 13:18.574
Good morning, guys.

13:18.608 --> 13:20.292
Steven's sleeping with a heifer.

13:20.343 --> 13:23.345
I'm gonna go hit the gym.

13:23.380 --> 13:25.047
I'll come with.

13:29.536 --> 13:30.819
I can't get through to her.

13:30.854 --> 13:33.672
She treats me like I'm out of touch.
I'm the cool dad.

13:36.501 --> 13:38.168
What?
I'm not the cool dad?

13:38.202 --> 13:39.586
George...

13:39.620 --> 13:41.638
Think about how you were
back in the day.

13:41.672 --> 13:45.275
You had sex with a lot
of the ladies, all right?

13:45.309 --> 13:48.094
You were the champion.
You were undefeated.

13:48.129 --> 13:50.513
How many women did you
bring down to the mat?

13:50.531 --> 13:51.815
You're being in appropriate.

13:51.849 --> 13:55.019
See, the old George would have
high-fived me right there

13:55.020 --> 13:56.520
and then had sex with her.

13:57.301 --> 13:59.168
Just because you're a dad
doesn't mean

13:59.203 --> 14:00.303
you can't be a dude.

14:00.337 --> 14:02.872
Be a single dude.
Don't be a single dad.

14:02.906 --> 14:05.241
If not for you,
then for me

14:05.275 --> 14:06.876
and the rest
of the married guys

14:06.910 --> 14:11.114
who can only have sex
with our wives... if at all.

14:11.148 --> 14:13.282
Hey, Jill.

14:13.300 --> 14:15.584
George needs to chill out.

14:15.602 --> 14:17.687
I don't even know
if I wanna do it with Scott.

14:17.705 --> 14:21.624
He wants to know how I feel
before <i>I</i> know how I feel.

14:21.658 --> 14:23.326
Hill!

14:23.344 --> 14:25.979
Yeah, sure, Scott is cute
and everything,

14:26.013 --> 14:29.165
and it's not like
he's an idiot...

14:29.199 --> 14:31.534
But truthfully,
he's kind of boring.

14:31.568 --> 14:33.269
Wait. Does that sound mean?
I don't mean it to sound mean.

14:33.304 --> 14:34.754
Pop it low.

14:34.788 --> 14:38.308
And enough about Zambia.
We get it.

14:38.342 --> 14:40.510
You've been to Africa.
You're a do-gooder.

14:40.544 --> 14:41.678
But you know what
you're not good at?

14:41.712 --> 14:43.846
Catch
and pivot at the waist.

14:43.881 --> 14:45.782
Basic conversation.

14:45.816 --> 14:47.383
The truth is...

14:47.418 --> 14:49.919
We don't have anything
in common.

14:49.953 --> 14:51.404
There's no spark.

14:51.438 --> 14:53.722
So what am I holding on to?

14:54.119 --> 14:56.171
Thanks, Dallas.

14:56.195 --> 14:57.446
This really helped.

15:01.885 --> 15:03.518
It sure did.

15:09.609 --> 15:11.126
Hello, Aaron?

15:14.529 --> 15:16.247
- George.
- Hi, Jocelyn.

15:16.317 --> 15:19.369
You forgot your glasses
at the club this morning.

15:19.420 --> 15:21.754
These are ladies' glasses.

15:22.756 --> 15:24.357
And they're bifocals.

15:25.676 --> 15:26.793
And they're not mine.

15:26.827 --> 15:28.494
Thanks for coming
all this way, though.

15:28.529 --> 15:32.432
Oh, yeah. I pass by
your place all the time.

15:32.466 --> 15:35.267
But you <i>probably</i>
don't notice.

15:35.286 --> 15:36.786
Sorry. I need to get Tessa's
clothes out of the dryer.

15:36.820 --> 15:38.755
They're mostly cottons, and if I
leave them in there too long,

15:38.789 --> 15:40.673
then she is a wrinkled mess.

15:40.708 --> 15:43.042
You're a really good dad.

15:43.060 --> 15:44.677
Yeah.

15:46.580 --> 15:49.015
But I'm also a dude.

15:50.601 --> 15:52.619
I know you are.

16:06.467 --> 16:08.017
Wait, wait, wait.

16:08.052 --> 16:09.402
I don't wanna give you
the wrong idea.

16:09.436 --> 16:11.120
Give it to me.

16:12.640 --> 16:14.107
Give me the wrong idea!

16:17.547 --> 16:20.866
- Grab it. Grab it.
- Slap it. Trick it.

16:20.901 --> 16:22.485
Trick it?
Who's a hungry hippo?!

16:22.536 --> 16:24.453
I'm a hungry hippo.
Connect 4.

16:24.488 --> 16:25.788
Connect all 4.
You connect all 4.

16:25.822 --> 16:27.289
So you like games,

16:27.341 --> 16:28.541
I'm gonna slide down
your chute,

16:28.575 --> 16:29.759
and I'm gonna climb
up your ladder.

16:29.810 --> 16:31.694
- Yeah.
- You into monopoly?

16:31.728 --> 16:32.878
I'm going to jail.

16:32.913 --> 16:34.981
I got your hair!

16:35.015 --> 16:36.983
I got your hair!

16:39.185 --> 16:41.404
Go ahead. All of it, all of it.
Yahtzee!

16:42.756 --> 16:45.675
<i>The workout with Dallas</i>
<i>had given me clarity.</i>

16:45.726 --> 16:47.410
<i>I knew what I had to do.</i>

16:47.444 --> 16:50.463
<i>I felt strong,</i>
<i>and so did my abs.</i>

16:52.683 --> 16:53.832
Round back!

16:59.506 --> 17:02.174
Hi, Tessa.
This is for your father.

17:02.766 --> 17:06.051
How did you know?

17:06.086 --> 17:07.752
It's a traditional
African courtship offering.

17:10.357 --> 17:12.157
It wasn't easy to find
a goat.

17:12.192 --> 17:13.826
Took some doing
on my part, so...

17:13.859 --> 17:17.229
I'm sure my dad will
appreciate the gesture, really.

17:17.263 --> 17:22.101
I-I'm just not sure about
the whole... courtship thing.

17:22.135 --> 17:25.104
I know this seems weird,
and there's a goat involved,

17:25.137 --> 17:27.173
which you're probably not
used to, but in our culture,

17:27.207 --> 17:29.742
sex is trivialized,
and I just wanted to make sure

17:29.776 --> 17:32.778
that our first time
had... meaning.

17:32.813 --> 17:34.747
You deserve
a thousand goats.

17:34.781 --> 17:35.255
Thanks.

17:35.256 --> 17:37.149
Tessa, don't think
I didn't notice.

17:37.184 --> 17:38.718
You've been pulling away.

17:38.752 --> 17:40.620
You wanted
a physical relationship,

17:40.654 --> 17:41.988
but I wasn't ready for it.

17:42.022 --> 17:43.289
I did, but then I got
to know you, and...

17:43.323 --> 17:46.325
But I didn't wanna lose you,
so I got ready.

17:46.360 --> 17:48.778
And now I'm ready for it.

17:54.107 --> 17:55.307
Lay with me.

17:55.342 --> 17:57.977
Keep in mind my parents
will be back by 6:00.

18:07.001 --> 18:09.034
<i>I decided</i>
<i>not to lay with Scott,</i>

18:09.377 --> 18:12.113
<i>and the two of us</i>
<i>went our separate ways.</i>

18:12.205 --> 18:14.541
<i>I got custody of the goat.</i>

18:17.160 --> 18:21.447
Hey! Tessa!

18:21.481 --> 18:23.649
Hey, goat.

18:23.684 --> 18:28.020
I was just, uh, returning
a pair of ladies' bifocals

18:28.054 --> 18:30.222
that didn't belong
to your dad,

18:30.240 --> 18:35.127
and then I tripped,
and I broke my...

18:36.463 --> 18:38.914
You don't have any water
on you, do you?

18:40.083 --> 18:42.335
Okay. Cool.

18:42.369 --> 18:43.669
Okay.

18:51.144 --> 18:53.045
What's with the goat?

18:53.079 --> 18:55.681
It's for you,
from my ex-boyfriend.

18:55.716 --> 18:57.416
Ex?

18:57.451 --> 18:59.268
It wasn't what you thought,
George.

18:59.302 --> 19:02.104
It wasn't what I thought,
either.

19:04.992 --> 19:05.941
But for the record,

19:05.976 --> 19:08.294
unless that was
your one true love

19:08.328 --> 19:10.946
I spotted
on the way out of here,

19:10.981 --> 19:13.099
you are a big, fat
hypocrite.

19:13.133 --> 19:15.001
I stand by what I said
earlier.

19:15.035 --> 19:16.869
You do it
for the wrong reasons,

19:16.903 --> 19:18.170
you'll regret it.

19:18.205 --> 19:20.206
This goat has better judgment than you.

19:20.240 --> 19:23.159
Hey, lay off the sneakers,
goat.

19:23.210 --> 19:26.979
<i>But some people just don't</i>
<i>wanna be told what to do,</i>

19:27.014 --> 19:28.614
<i>and Dallas...</i>

19:28.648 --> 19:29.882
<i>Was one of them.</i>

19:29.916 --> 19:33.319
This is <i>my</i> house. Tell me
what to do with <i>my</i> house...

19:33.353 --> 19:35.888
This is how you leave a man,
Yakult.

19:35.922 --> 19:38.924
<i> What doesn't
kill you makes you stronger </i>

19:38.959 --> 19:40.860
<i> stand a little taller</i>

19:40.894 --> 19:44.296
<i> doesn't mean I'm lonely
when I'm alone </i>

19:44.331 --> 19:46.932
<i> what doesn't kill you
makes a fighter </i>

19:46.966 --> 19:49.568
<i> footsteps even lighter</i>

19:49.603 --> 19:53.005
<i> doesn't meant I'm over
'cause you're gone </i>

19:53.040 --> 19:55.608
<i> what doesn't kill you
stronger </i>

19:55.642 --> 19:58.044
<i> stronger</i>

20:00.981 --> 20:03.282
Mommy...

20:03.316 --> 20:05.251
Are you and dad
getting a divorce?

20:11.842 --> 20:13.709
Two birthday parties,
two Christmases,

20:13.760 --> 20:14.994
and two bedrooms to decorate.

20:15.028 --> 20:16.662
I am so happy, you guys.

20:16.680 --> 20:18.264
- You are so lucky.
- I know.

20:18.298 --> 20:19.965
I wish my parents were
getting a divorce.

20:19.966 --> 20:20.382
I know.

20:20.434 --> 20:22.968
<i>There it was again...</i>
<i>The look of envy.</i>

20:23.002 --> 20:24.837
<i>Chatswin's gotta be</i>
<i>the only place on Earth</i>

20:24.855 --> 20:27.506
<i>where divorce was</i>
<i>something you high-five over.</i>

20:27.524 --> 20:29.692
Gentlemen,
when you're ready to order,

20:29.726 --> 20:32.177
just call me if you know how
to call a person,

20:32.195 --> 20:35.281
which it doesn't seem
like you do.

20:35.315 --> 20:36.515
You know what?
I'm starving.

20:36.533 --> 20:37.867
I'm gonna go
with the power parfait.

20:37.901 --> 20:39.618
Yeah. I'll just have
eggs over easy.

20:39.653 --> 20:41.153
You like everything
over easy.

20:41.187 --> 20:42.488
Just go with the scramble.

20:42.522 --> 20:43.823
You know what? I'm just
gonna have scrambled eggs,

20:43.857 --> 20:45.024
uh, with a side of fruit.

20:45.058 --> 20:46.959
Got a little something extra
on the side, do you?

20:46.993 --> 20:48.193
Okay, this is what
I was afraid of.

20:48.211 --> 20:51.163
I-I said I didn't want to
give you the wrong idea.

20:51.197 --> 20:55.000
But as I recall,
you <i>gave</i> me the wrong idea.

20:58.438 --> 21:01.107
I'm kidding.

21:01.141 --> 21:04.443
I'm totally kidding, George.
 You big goof.

21:04.478 --> 21:06.712
I'll be right back
with your eggs.

Ladies and gentlemen,

21:09.099 --> 21:11.350
weighing in at 180 pounds
in this corner,

21:11.384 --> 21:12.768
the heavyweight champion
of lovemaking...

21:12.803 --> 21:14.253
"Gorgeous" George Altman!

21:14.287 --> 21:15.304
Okay, okay.

21:15.355 --> 21:17.139
- He's back!
- He's not back.

21:17.190 --> 21:18.307
Yes, he is.

21:18.358 --> 21:20.359
Although I would not
eat those eggs.
