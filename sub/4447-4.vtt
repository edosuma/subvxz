You told her I was a player?

I'm sorry.
It was a dumb thing to say.

- You're so transparent.

on more responsibility

18:09.167 --> 18:10.000
I promise.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.583
♪ Oh oh oh oh eh eh eh ♪

18:12.583 --> 18:15.417
♪ Oh oh oh oh oh
yeah you're stutterin' ♪

18:15.417 --> 18:18.125

18:18.125 --> 18:21.583

yeah you're stutterin' ♪

18:30.667 --> 18:33.084
Guess you worked up
an appetite, huh?

18:33.084 --> 18:36.250
- Hm?
- Helping down at the pub.

18:36.250 --> 18:39.625
Oh, yeah, no. Absolutely.
How's it going down there?

18:39.625 --> 18:41.291
Uh, good, yeah, uh..

18:41.291 --> 18:44.000
I'm-I'm actually heading
back in a sec for
a last-minute check.

18:47.458 --> 18:50.667
Um, listen, I've, I've been
thinking about your offer

18:50.667 --> 18:55.042
to go out sometime,
and I'd, I'd like to.

18:55.042 --> 18:57.041
You'd, uh, go out with me?

18:57.041 --> 19:00.041
I was in this
big relationship,
a couple of years back.

19:00.041 --> 19:01.875
It didn't end well.

19:01.875 --> 19:04.166
I think I ended up
with some trust issues.

19:04.166 --> 19:06.917
Anyways, if I can
depend on you
to toss me around

19:06.917 --> 19:09.542
and catch me on
the first bounce

19:09.542 --> 19:13.083
I think we should be able to
listen to some music together.

19:13.083 --> 19:16.792
Uh, Brokedown Cadillac
is playing at Hi-Tone
tomorrow.

19:16.792 --> 19:20.625
- You interested?
- Oh. Yeah. Absolutely.

19:20.625 --> 19:22.167
Great, we, can, uh,
we can go out

19:22.167 --> 19:23.041
after my mom's
thing at the pub.

19:23.041 --> 19:25.166
- Great. Okay--
- Great.

19:25.166 --> 19:26.959
Great.

19:31.625 --> 19:33.042
Great.

19:33.042 --> 19:34.041
It's quite the spread, Layne.

19:34.041 --> 19:36.792
- 'Oh. Thank you.'
- It's really good, mom.

19:36.792 --> 19:38.250
You must have spent the entire
day in the kitchen.

19:38.250 --> 19:39.625
Oh, I did.

19:39.625 --> 19:41.708
This is delicious,
Mrs. Monroe.

19:41.708 --> 19:43.458
Layne is an excellent cook.

19:43.458 --> 19:44.875
You know, my mama used to say

19:44.875 --> 19:47.042
"You cannot serve ham
without sweet potatoes."

19:47.042 --> 19:49.500
It's like laughter
without mirth.

19:49.500 --> 19:52.625
- You say that, too.
- Well, it's the truth.

19:52.625 --> 19:55.000
You know,
I think my mama said that.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.125
I swear, you Southern ladies

19:56.125 --> 19:57.792
you gotta start getting
some new lines.

19:57.792 --> 19:59.583
[all chuckling]

19:59.583 --> 20:02.000
Hm. We are all adorable.

20:04.875 --> 20:06.250
Do you spend
much time at home, Dan?

20:06.250 --> 20:07.834
I do. Yeah.

20:07.834 --> 20:11.792
My, um, my mom passed away
two years ago, November

20:11.792 --> 20:13.583
'so I moved back in
with my dad to help out.'

20:13.583 --> 20:15.209
- Really?
- 'Things have been tight.'

20:15.209 --> 20:17.583
It's kinda...made more sense
to pay rent

20:17.583 --> 20:19.250
to my family than a stranger.

20:19.250 --> 20:20.458
Hm.

20:20.458 --> 20:21.959
What church do you go to, Dan?

20:21.959 --> 20:24.083
Or do you just brunch
on Sundays?

20:24.083 --> 20:26.000
Don't pick, Charlotte.

20:27.209 --> 20:28.667
Thank you.

20:28.667 --> 20:30.125
It's just a question.

20:32.000 --> 20:35.125
Do you have a church, Dan?

20:36.209 --> 20:39.417
I am partial
to the Sunrise Gospel Mass

20:39.417 --> 20:41.209
at New Bethel on Henry Street

20:41.209 --> 20:44.000
'but I haven't really settled
on one church.'

20:44.000 --> 20:46.291
Guess I'm Paul
on the road to Damascus.

20:46.291 --> 20:49.333
Just trusting
the good Lord's gonna lead me

20:49.333 --> 20:51.000
where I need to go.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.042
Well, maybe he'll lead you
to All Saints with Savannah

20:53.042 --> 20:54.375
'one of these Sundays.'

20:54.375 --> 20:57.208
Yeah, wouldn't be surprised.

20:57.208 --> 20:59.708
That is a great idea.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.417
Could I have some
more of these

21:02.417 --> 21:04.000
amazing potatoes,
Mrs. Monroe?

21:04.000 --> 21:06.084
Oh, absolutely.

21:06.084 --> 21:09.375
They remind me of my mother's.

21:09.375 --> 21:11.583
He talks pretty.

21:11.583 --> 21:13.125
That he does.

21:13.125 --> 21:15.000
[instrumental music]

21:16.417 --> 21:19.125
- How's the tweeting going?
- Hm, decided not to bother.

21:19.125 --> 21:20.917
Too complicated.

21:20.917 --> 21:23.166
So how is anyone
supposed to know
this event is happening?

21:23.166 --> 21:25.917
I made up these
little posters.
Took me all day.

21:25.917 --> 21:28.542
I swear, you need
an owner's manual
to figure out

21:28.542 --> 21:30.042
how to use
that inkjet printer.

21:30.042 --> 21:31.375
Which is why they give you
an owner's manual.

21:31.375 --> 21:33.750
- Mom, we agreed to this.
- Well, I changed my mind.

21:33.750 --> 21:35.750
And I don't appreciate
being ordered around

21:35.750 --> 21:37.959
by my bossy-boots daughter.

21:37.959 --> 21:40.167
You know what, if I weren't
bossy, none of this would

21:40.167 --> 21:42.041
have happened,
not that it matters anyway

21:42.041 --> 21:43.667
since nobody's gonna know
about the event.

21:43.667 --> 21:45.417
See, now, why are you
always so negative?

21:45.417 --> 21:46.542
Why are you always
so helpless?

21:46.542 --> 21:47.959
I am not helpless.

21:47.959 --> 21:49.959
I just don't care about
the details like you do

21:49.959 --> 21:52.542
which is why
I let you do things
your own way.

21:52.542 --> 21:53.792
You let me?

21:53.792 --> 21:55.583
Oh, wow, mom,
that is so generous

21:55.583 --> 21:57.625
that you, you let me
do your work for you

21:57.625 --> 21:59.083
with the freedom to do it
however I want.

21:59.083 --> 22:00.750
You know, and I thought
that carrying me around

22:00.750 --> 22:03.375
for nine months in utero
was a sacrifice.

22:03.375 --> 22:04.792
I-I am truly humbled.

22:04.792 --> 22:07.500
Sarcasm gives you crow's-feet.

22:07.500 --> 22:10.042
You know, I am sick
of cleaning up
your messes.

22:10.042 --> 22:11.167
I really am.

22:11.167 --> 22:12.166
Well, then you shouldn't have
volunteered

22:12.166 --> 22:14.167
which, by the way, is what
you did, and I have witnesses.

22:14.167 --> 22:16.333
Oh, you know, well, now, I'm
un-volunteering, so good luck.

22:16.333 --> 22:18.708
Try not to screw it up.

22:18.708 --> 22:21.708
- I don't need your luck!
- 'Fine.'

22:27.042 --> 22:30.000
Oh. It is so good
to have you home.

22:31.875 --> 22:34.167
It's good to be here.

22:34.167 --> 22:36.000
I've been doing a lot of
thinking about the importance

22:36.000 --> 22:38.375
of family
ever since Charlotte's fall.

22:38.375 --> 22:41.625
I have been rigid and very
unforgiving of you, Savannah

22:41.625 --> 22:43.708
and I am sorry.

22:44.750 --> 22:47.167
It's okay, mom.

22:47.167 --> 22:50.209
I know how bad you wanted me
to stay at Mem-Chris

22:50.209 --> 22:53.792
but as you can see,
I'm doing just fine at Lancer.

22:53.792 --> 22:57.125
Well...you are changing,
though.

22:57.125 --> 23:00.750
- Well, in a good way I hope.
- Please.

23:00.750 --> 23:03.250
I mean, that boy out there..

23:03.250 --> 23:05.208
You don't like Dan?

23:05.208 --> 23:07.875
But you seemed
to really warm up to him.

23:07.875 --> 23:10.792
That boy is charming
and as slick as an eel

23:10.792 --> 23:13.375
but he's not serious,
and certainly not about you.

23:13.375 --> 23:16.167
I think he thinks
it's a big game or something.

23:16.167 --> 23:18.458
- What makes you say that?
- A mother knows.

23:18.458 --> 23:20.209
Has he made you any promises?

23:20.209 --> 23:22.542
We've only been
going out a few weeks.
I wouldn't expect him to.

23:22.542 --> 23:25.792
Oh, but he would expect you to
show that very public display

23:25.792 --> 23:28.167
of your feelings for him
at that cafe.

23:28.167 --> 23:29.750
'I don't think that
is something you
would have done'

23:29.750 --> 23:33.208
if you were still here
and going to
Memphis Christian.

23:33.208 --> 23:36.000
This conversation
officially sucks.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.291
Don't you use that word
in this house!

23:38.291 --> 23:40.458
- 'Savannah!'
- Dan, we're leaving.

23:40.458 --> 23:43.750
Savannah! Wait!

23:43.750 --> 23:45.834
I do not wanna fight anymore.

23:45.834 --> 23:47.417
Now, we all need to make
whatever compromises

23:47.417 --> 23:51.667
and sacrifices it takes
to stand together as a family.

23:51.667 --> 23:54.041
We, mom? Or me?

23:54.041 --> 23:56.000
You keep a civil tongue
in your head.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.250
When you are in this house,
you will abide by our rules.

23:58.250 --> 24:00.583
- And that includes showing--
- You've been nasty to me--

24:00.583 --> 24:02.084
And I'm sick
of putting up with it!

24:03.333 --> 24:06.209
I forgot how fun
these family dinners could be.

24:06.209 --> 24:08.000
Layne, we talked about
how this was--

24:08.000 --> 24:11.959
Back off, Parker.
I am handling this!

24:14.500 --> 24:17.209
I am handling this.

24:17.209 --> 24:20.000
Now, your father and I
have discussed this matter

24:20.000 --> 24:21.917
and here is our bottom line.

24:21.917 --> 24:24.792
We agree
you can stay
enrolled at Lancer

24:24.792 --> 24:27.500
and you can stay on
the squad there.

24:27.500 --> 24:30.083
And Dan?

24:30.083 --> 24:32.667
He is not for you, Savannah.

24:32.667 --> 24:33.875
We want you to move home

24:33.875 --> 24:36.333
spend time with boys
who are like us.

24:36.333 --> 24:39.583
Mona Fellow's son,
Noah, he would give
his good right arm

24:39.583 --> 24:41.208
to go out on a date with you.

24:41.208 --> 24:45.125
And if dating
a one-armed zealot
isn't acceptable to me?

24:45.125 --> 24:47.834
Well, then, I guess
you have a choice to make.

24:51.792 --> 24:54.500
[instrumental music]

24:54.500 --> 24:57.084
Let's go, Dan.

25:01.500 --> 25:05.959
Savannah, if you go
through that door,
there is no coming back.

25:07.250 --> 25:11.458
That doesn't
change the fact
that I love you all.

25:13.125 --> 25:14.959
Thank you for dinner.

25:15.834 --> 25:18.375
[music continues]

25:21.041 --> 25:22.500
[sighs]

25:22.500 --> 25:24.917
You okay?

25:24.917 --> 25:26.917
I'm not sure yet.

25:26.917 --> 25:29.000
I think.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.875
Guess now, I stood up to her,
it feels good.

25:31.875 --> 25:34.042
You know, she'll probably
change her mind.

25:36.000 --> 25:40.084
- Are you okay?
- Me? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

25:40.084 --> 25:43.000
I mean...I've had more
relaxing evenings.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.209
The potatoes
were a little undercooked.

25:47.458 --> 25:50.625
I've never had anyone
disown their family over me.

25:50.625 --> 25:52.917
- Was that weird?
- Yes.

25:52.917 --> 25:54.917
Very.

25:54.917 --> 25:57.041
Well, don't make
too much of it.

25:57.041 --> 25:59.417
It really wasn't about you.

25:59.417 --> 26:01.125
It was about me.

26:01.125 --> 26:04.000
Getting clear on who I am

26:04.000 --> 26:05.917
or who I want to be.

26:05.917 --> 26:09.542
[sighs]
I mean, we're casual, right?

26:09.542 --> 26:11.250
Right.

26:11.250 --> 26:13.291
You wanna come in?

26:13.291 --> 26:16.291
It's late.
I should probably go.

26:17.708 --> 26:20.125
Okay.

26:20.125 --> 26:22.084
Goodnight.

26:24.250 --> 26:26.000
Goodnight.

26:31.834 --> 26:33.875
Oh, crap, crap, crap.

26:33.875 --> 26:36.667
- Crap.
- Marti? What's up?

26:36.667 --> 26:37.834
[sighs]

26:37.834 --> 26:40.041
- Our Wi-Fi's down again.
- Oh.

26:40.041 --> 26:42.500
You just need to reboot
the connection to the router.

26:43.375 --> 26:45.166
- Oh.
- Here.

26:46.625 --> 26:48.041
What are you trying to do?

26:48.041 --> 26:50.458
Get the word out on
my mom's open-mic night.

26:50.458 --> 26:52.750
I thought you weren't
helping mom anymore.

26:52.750 --> 26:53.959
I did say that, yes.

26:53.959 --> 26:55.792
Thank you for pointing out
my hypocrisy.

26:55.792 --> 26:59.000
So basically, you're Lewis'
flyer and your mom's base.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.875
I'm just trying
to help her succeed.

27:00.875 --> 27:02.167
Spoken like a true base.

27:02.167 --> 27:03.000
Alright, you can
stop calling me

27:03.000 --> 27:04.375
base any time now.

27:04.375 --> 27:07.042
[chuckles]

27:07.042 --> 27:09.625
There. Just let it
log back in.

27:09.625 --> 27:13.000
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.834
Listen...I know I get pissed

27:15.834 --> 27:18.417
but my mom does need me.

27:18.417 --> 27:20.166
I can't just let go.

27:20.166 --> 27:23.458
Well, if a base can't let go,
a flyer never learns to fly.

27:23.458 --> 27:26.084
And what if you let go
and your flyer falls
on her ass?

27:26.084 --> 27:28.834
Well, then you
help her back up
and let her go again.

27:28.834 --> 27:31.042
Only way she learns.

27:31.042 --> 27:33.583
[instrumental music]

27:38.625 --> 27:40.125
[sighs]

27:43.708 --> 27:46.333
Hey, uh, we need to talk.

27:46.333 --> 27:47.750
Really?

27:47.750 --> 27:50.375
'Cause   I
can think
of something more fun to do.

27:50.375 --> 27:53.083
Yeah, no, that's what we need
to talk about, alright?

27:53.083 --> 27:56.000
And I need to make sure
we're on the same page here.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
Now, what happened
between us yesterday

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
was just a one-time thing.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.500
Oh, until next time.

28:00.500 --> 28:01.917
'That's how it works
with us, Lewis--'

28:01.917 --> 28:03.875
No, not anymore, okay?

28:03.875 --> 28:05.708
Now, I'm done with us.

28:05.708 --> 28:07.667
And I'm done helping you
train for the bid video, too.

28:07.667 --> 28:09.417
You and Darwin
will just have to..
