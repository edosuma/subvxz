00:35.973 --> 00:37.807
Welcome
to Compton, California.

00:42.714 --> 00:46.615
The Sarge partnered us up together
so I can teach you the ropes, huh?

00:46.617 --> 00:49.853
So today is your first day
to commence the training

00:49.855 --> 00:52.825
to become a Compton, California,
police officer.

00:53.224 --> 00:54.558
My training day.

00:54.560 --> 00:56.863
Yeah, you can call it that.

00:57.194 --> 00:59.631
And one of the first lessons
you've gotta learn

00:59.932 --> 01:02.198
is how to stay cool
under pressure.

01:07.004 --> 01:09.706
Always expect the unexpected.

01:09.708 --> 01:11.977
Expect the unexpected.

01:12.977 --> 01:14.677
You see, I've been on the force

01:14.679 --> 01:16.912
for 15 years, huh?

01:16.914 --> 01:18.250
And nothing
surprises me anymore.

01:19.718 --> 01:21.287
Holy Mother of Jesus!

01:22.220 --> 01:25.120
Stay cool under pressure.
Stay cool under pressure.

01:25.122 --> 01:27.222
Screw that, rookie!
It's raining snakes.

01:27.224 --> 01:29.262
This is some biblical shit
right here!

01:34.765 --> 01:36.167
Hmm.

01:36.768 --> 01:38.267
It appears we have an embryo

01:38.269 --> 01:40.105
from the reptilian
<i>Colubridae</i> family.

01:42.107 --> 01:45.176
- An undamaged egg.
- Hey, homeboy.

01:51.149 --> 01:52.918
Neon.

02:07.064 --> 02:08.934
- Hey, Vurkel.
- Neon...

02:11.302 --> 02:14.005
Not you, Vurkel!
She's waving at me.

02:16.007 --> 02:17.206
- Neon.
- What's up?

02:17.208 --> 02:19.211
- What up, girl?
- Nothing. You're crazy.

02:19.711 --> 02:22.148
Why are you so early
at the party?

02:22.880 --> 02:24.279
We ain't even set up yet.

02:24.281 --> 02:25.848
You know I gotta go
to work later.

02:25.850 --> 02:29.853
Work? We need you here
so you can sing your verses.

02:29.855 --> 02:31.788
We not a band without you.

02:31.790 --> 02:32.825
Reptilian stem cells!

02:33.090 --> 02:35.124
What you talkin' about, V?

02:35.126 --> 02:37.926
If I can activate the reptilian stem
cells in this newly hatched snake,

02:37.928 --> 02:40.163
the potential for growth
would be nearly unlimited.

02:40.165 --> 02:42.098
Here he goes again.

02:42.100 --> 02:43.666
I don't know
what he's talking about.

02:43.668 --> 02:46.005
Why must I be cursed
with a mad scientist roommate?

02:51.876 --> 02:54.843
- Oh, it tickles.
- Damn, V!

02:54.845 --> 02:57.146
You better work
on those dance moves

02:57.148 --> 02:58.717
if you wanna
get any play at the party.

02:59.951 --> 03:01.120
What party?

03:02.087 --> 03:04.219
Just a little warm-up gig.

03:04.221 --> 03:05.857
Did you ask your Grandma?

03:07.058 --> 03:08.960
I need isolation
for my experiments.

03:09.894 --> 03:11.760
Don't be a buzzkill, Vurkel.

03:11.762 --> 03:13.699
Damn, Pinball,
don't be a waxed scrote!

03:14.266 --> 03:16.102
You should hang with us
at the party, Vurkel.

03:16.902 --> 03:19.238
Wow, Neon inviting me
to a party.

03:20.304 --> 03:21.904
I'll go anywhere you go, my lo...

03:21.906 --> 03:25.043
Whoa, don't get fresh, Boo.
Just bein' neighborly.

03:25.410 --> 03:28.748
I've gotta study the specimen
in my lab.

03:29.314 --> 03:31.417
Okay, well,
what you got in there, anyway?

03:31.950 --> 03:33.219
- What have I got?
- Yeah.

03:33.719 --> 03:38.357
I got a snake. A little snake.

03:38.790 --> 03:41.191
- Wanna see him?
- How little are we talk...

03:41.193 --> 03:43.729
Nobody wants to see
your little snake, Vurkel.

03:44.095 --> 03:48.798
Only snake Neon wants to see
is Cam's big black mamba.

03:48.800 --> 03:49.668
Get out of my face.

03:50.636 --> 03:52.705
- Cam's coming tonight.
- Naturally, Vurkel.

03:53.070 --> 03:54.871
He is the leader of the crew.

03:54.873 --> 03:56.872
We wouldn't be
a rap crew without him.

03:56.874 --> 03:59.044
All hail Cam.

04:01.412 --> 04:02.848
Cam.

04:33.011 --> 04:35.043
What's up, what's up? What's up?

04:35.045 --> 04:36.014
Party, party.

04:42.920 --> 04:44.255
Those idiots!

04:55.966 --> 04:58.937
There's so much more to life
than infantile partying.

05:07.545 --> 05:10.182
I'm more concerned about you
'cause you're small.

05:11.415 --> 05:15.220
But we'll show them
who's itsy-bitsy.

05:26.965 --> 05:29.501
First the snake, then...

05:33.437 --> 05:35.340
They'll never call me
"little man" again.

05:42.146 --> 05:43.481
<i>All systems ready.</i>

05:43.982 --> 05:45.017
<i>Activate.</i>

05:52.891 --> 05:55.961
It works! It works!

05:59.497 --> 06:02.232
So I was at this
rooftop party the other night,

06:02.234 --> 06:05.334
I mean, it was totally bangin',
you know what I mean?

06:05.336 --> 06:07.872
Like, the sound system
up there is baller.

06:08.506 --> 06:10.009
See, that's what I'm
talkin' about.

06:10.408 --> 06:12.444
Managing music and shit.

06:13.011 --> 06:14.543
That's what I want to do.

06:14.545 --> 06:17.247
Well, I mean, you gotta be,
like, real pro, you know?

06:17.249 --> 06:20.319
You can't go around mixing business
and pleasure like this, you know?

06:21.119 --> 06:25.420
When am I gonna hear those new sick
beats you were gonna spin for me?

06:25.422 --> 06:27.192
You want me to spin it
for business?

06:28.259 --> 06:29.459
Or pleasure?

06:29.461 --> 06:31.427
Well, well, well. My man.

06:31.429 --> 06:33.262
Nice of you
to finally show up.

06:33.264 --> 06:34.663
I ain't your man, Neon.

06:34.665 --> 06:36.598
Damn, Cam.
I didn't mean it like that.

06:36.600 --> 06:39.904
I meant like, my man,
like, my homeboy.

06:40.170 --> 06:43.273
Aright, girl.
You got those pipes warmed up?

06:43.275 --> 06:46.009
These people gonna love you once
you drop them bomb dulcet tones.

06:46.011 --> 06:48.080
Cam, what makes you think
I want somebody's love?

06:48.480 --> 06:50.079
Child, a girl can't
survive off that.

06:50.081 --> 06:52.348
She needs cash flow.

06:52.350 --> 06:55.550
That's all gonna be taken care of once
Uppercase Records sees our talent tomorrow.

06:55.552 --> 06:57.021
Yo, Pinball!

06:57.622 --> 06:58.389
Yo, Pinball.

06:59.925 --> 07:00.559
Pinball, man.

07:01.259 --> 07:02.524
When you gonna play the track

07:02.526 --> 07:04.459
for that talent agent friend
of yours, man?

07:04.461 --> 07:08.131
This is her.
R.E.L., meet Beez Neez.

07:08.133 --> 07:10.300
Beez Neez! Oh, my God!

07:10.302 --> 07:12.701
Your raps are T-I-T.

07:12.703 --> 07:16.372
Yeah. We spared no expense
on this track.

07:16.374 --> 07:19.408
Nothing but
high production quality.

07:19.410 --> 07:21.444
Pinball's homegirl's
gots the hookup.

07:21.446 --> 07:25.615
I got you all
into Uppercase Records tomorrow.

07:25.617 --> 07:27.617
We meetin'
with the head cat himself.

07:27.619 --> 07:29.952
They don't need
any more drama, all right?

07:29.954 --> 07:32.190
Did you all steal the money
to produce that record?

07:32.557 --> 07:35.158
- Steal? You calling me a thief?
- No!

07:35.160 --> 07:37.225
- Are you saying we stole?
- No, no, no, no.

07:37.227 --> 07:40.299
Yo, my man borrowed a grip
from Alley Jaws.

07:40.665 --> 07:42.432
- Alley Jaws?
- Yeah.

07:42.434 --> 07:45.401
Yo, that dude is mad shady, yo.

07:45.403 --> 07:47.605
Ease up, Carrot Top.

07:48.639 --> 07:50.740

08:00.117 --> 08:02.287
- Look, that only happened once.
- This crew needs you.

08:03.355 --> 08:06.254
And what do you need, Cam?

08:06.256 --> 08:10.293
What I need?

10:12.382 --> 10:13.551
Wait, what?

10:37.141 --> 10:37.874
Pinball!

10:37.876 --> 10:39.674
Yo, it's the Alley Jaws.

10:39.676 --> 10:42.912
Pinball, I thought you said
you were T-I-T tight.

10:42.914 --> 10:46.184
We are tight.
Just let me talk to him.

10:46.517 --> 10:47.452
- Pinball!
- He likes me.

10:51.756 --> 10:54.492
I want my money!
Where you at?

10:54.892 --> 10:57.562
I can hear your lame-ass beats
a mile away.

10:57.862 --> 11:00.428
- You better have my money!
- Alley Jaws.

11:00.430 --> 11:02.164
It's so good to see...

11:02.166 --> 11:04.900
I thought I recognized the sound
of your AK-47.

11:04.902 --> 11:07.336
You brought
your beautiful ladies here.

11:07.338 --> 11:08.738
You always know how
to show up unannounced.

11:08.740 --> 11:09.905
What can I do for you today?

11:09.907 --> 11:12.441
- Where's my money?
- Money!

11:12.443 --> 11:13.942
- Money.
- Money!

11:13.944 --> 11:16.211
But you said I can pay you back
next week, remember?

11:16.213 --> 11:18.813
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no...

11:18.815 --> 11:21.450
- No, no, no, no.
- No, no, no.

11:21.452 --> 11:23.822
That is repayment
of the principal sum.

11:24.622 --> 11:26.855
We are talking
about the interest.

11:26.857 --> 11:28.658
And I ain't the patient type.

11:28.660 --> 11:30.625
Unless you want me
to go compound on your ass.

11:30.627 --> 11:32.794
Compound on my ass?

11:32.796 --> 11:35.498
Compound's when
I reinvest the interest

11:35.500 --> 11:38.701
so the interest in the next period
is earned on the principal sum

11:38.703 --> 11:42.938
and the previously
accrued interest.

11:42.940 --> 11:44.941
That's compound interest,
bitch.

11:44.943 --> 11:47.210
Uh-huh, way to go.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:47.212 --> 11:49.345
Previous interest
on top of interest, interest...

11:49.347 --> 11:51.846
Where is my money!

11:51.848 --> 11:53.448
Be careful where you
pointin' that gun, man.

11:53.450 --> 11:54.585
What's up, Alley?

11:54.986 --> 11:57.620
Ooh! Cam!

11:57.622 --> 11:58.653
Why the negativity?

12:02.760 --> 12:04.726
No!

12:04.728 --> 12:07.732
Well, well, if it isn't Cam.

12:08.366 --> 12:10.569
The wannabe banger
from Compton.

12:10.767 --> 12:12.400
You know your boy
Pinball over there

12:12.402 --> 12:14.870
is in some pretty deep
financial shit with me.

12:14.872 --> 12:17.639
Lay off, man. Those funds were
for all of us in the group.

12:17.641 --> 12:19.008
Got this audition
tomorrow, see...

12:19.010 --> 12:22.477
What I see is that
you got money to have a party,

12:22.479 --> 12:25.413
but not paying me back
the money you owe me

12:25.415 --> 12:28.884
in accordance with the frequency
computations in our binding contract.

12:28.886 --> 12:29.851
You made an investment,

12:29.853 --> 12:32.288
and trust me,
it's gonna pay off in dividends.

12:32.290 --> 12:34.289
You gonna drop
some verses on us, Cam?

12:34.291 --> 12:35.325
Shut up, Larissa.

12:35.327 --> 12:37.426
I used to do your algebra
homework for you, girl.

12:37.428 --> 12:40.028
- Yeah? I got C's.
- Don't be an asshole.

12:40.030 --> 12:40.699
Hey!

12:41.598 --> 12:43.331
Ooh!

12:43.333 --> 12:48.439
Nobody, but nobody
disrespects my bitches but me!

12:48.872 --> 12:50.675
- Mm-hmm.
- Shut up!

12:55.545 --> 12:56.247
Now...

12:58.282 --> 13:01.786
You're gonna tell me exactly
what happened to my money.

13:03.721 --> 13:04.423
Before I...

13:06.324 --> 13:07.822
Nice snake, Cam.

13:07.824 --> 13:09.261
You dirty mother...

13:10.027 --> 13:12.561
That was a snake!
You know I hate snakes!

13:12.563 --> 13:14.462
I be cold-blooded, yo.

13:14.464 --> 13:16.500
You gonna be dead blooded in a
second is what you're gonna be.

13:23.074 --> 13:24.508
You leave that boy alone!

13:24.775 --> 13:27.643
- Miss Jones?
- Go on! Drop your piece.

13:27.645 --> 13:28.977
Miss Jones, you don't have to...

13:28.979 --> 13:30.915
You know I care
about you, Cam.

13:31.949 --> 13:33.515
Fuck you, Alley.

13:33.517 --> 13:36.287
Get on outta here,
and take your floozies with ya.

13:36.554 --> 13:38.723
Go on! Leave Cam be.

13:39.623 --> 13:40.925
This isn't over, Cam.

13:41.559 --> 13:42.924
- I'll get your money, dog.
- Yeah.

13:42.926 --> 13:44.059
We got the hookup on a meeting

13:44.061 --> 13:46.095
at Uppercase Records
tomorrow afternoon.

13:46.097 --> 13:47.462
- Yeah.
- We get signed.

13:47.464 --> 13:48.730
- Yeah.
- We be ballin'.

13:48.732 --> 13:51.303
- Yeah!
- Keep dreaming.

13:51.769 --> 13:53.272
'Cause that old broad?

13:54.539 --> 13:55.607
She's not always gonna be there
to protect your fucking ass!

13:55.806 --> 13:57.373
Watch your language, boy.

13:57.375 --> 13:58.944
I'll always be here for him.

13:59.609 --> 14:01.443
You know what?
I had about enough of him.

14:01.445 --> 14:03.111
Take your ass
on back to Riverside.

14:03.113 --> 14:04.613
Hold me back, I swear.

14:04.615 --> 14:06.418
I already called
the police.

14:06.784 --> 14:08.384
Get on out of here,
floozies.

14:08.386 --> 14:10.720
Come on, bitch,
I mean... ladies.

14:10.722 --> 14:12.355
Yeah, come compound that now.

14:12.357 --> 14:13.589
- Chill.
- Go on!

14:13.591 --> 14:14.823
Bitch, move it, move it.

14:14.825 --> 14:16.694
- Floozies, go on!
- Come on.

14:17.929 --> 14:21.833
Damn. Thusela Jones
saves the day again.

14:22.500 --> 14:24.133
That old gal sure is something.

14:24.135 --> 14:26.634
Thanks, Miss Jones.
Glad you got my back.

14:26.636 --> 14:28.506
Of course, my boy.

14:28.905 --> 14:32.611
But your shenanigans is causing
me to be late for choir practice.

14:33.710 --> 14:35.646
You got some... yayo?

14:36.580 --> 14:38.847
- Uh-uh.
- Crystal?

14:38.849 --> 14:41.552
- Zoom-zoom?
- No, I ain't no dealer.

14:41.819 --> 14:43.786
I mean, I sold Mucinex
to Vurkel one time,

14:43.788 --> 14:45.821
but that was
in my younger, wilder days.

14:45.823 --> 14:47.822
What an ungrateful
piece of shit.

14:47.824 --> 14:51.629
I just fucking saved your ass,
and you can't even hook a sister up?

14:55.867 --> 14:57.535
How about an aph?

14:57.769 --> 14:59.905
Nah, I'm all right, Miss Jones.

15:00.103 --> 15:02.773
All right, I love you.
I'll see you later.

15:03.107 --> 15:04.509
I'm sure you will.

15:06.777 --> 15:09.445
Clear the space, people.
Clear the space.

15:09.447 --> 15:10.913
Cam, you son of a bitch!

15:10.915 --> 15:13.515
We got a new hero in Compton.

15:13.517 --> 15:15.653
- My man, Cam.
- Shut up, Pin.

15:15.886 --> 15:17.787
You need to be
a better communicator.

15:17.789 --> 15:20.089
Ease Alley Jaw's mind.
I know how you are with your phone.

15:20.091 --> 15:22.727
My snake! My snake!
Has anyone seen my snake?

15:23.093 --> 15:24.960
Yeah.

15:24.962 --> 15:28.798
This G right here used it to
bust up a gun-wielding gangster

15:28.800 --> 15:30.633
with your big-ass snake.

15:30.635 --> 15:32.934
Yo, sorry I had to resort
to violence with your snake, V.

15:32.936 --> 15:34.071
It's probably up
in a bush somewhere.

15:34.604 --> 15:37.408
Yeah, yo mom's bush.

15:38.575 --> 15:42.577
Yo, Vurkel, hey, yo mama, man,
she is a real skilled gardener!

15:44.848 --> 15:46.014
Yeah.

16:12.477 --> 16:13.511
Back, sucker, back!

16:18.982 --> 16:21.553
Back! Get back!

16:22.185 --> 16:24.756
Oh, no, not today.

16:26.122 --> 16:29.091
Thusela Jones will meet the Lord
on her own terms.

16:36.700 --> 16:37.966
Okay, all right.

16:37.968 --> 16:41.870
In order to work these streets,
you gotta be these streets, huh?

16:41.872 --> 16:43.672
You gotta taste these streets.

16:43.674 --> 16:45.610
You gotta know
what the dealers are selling.

16:46.644 --> 16:48.547
- Take it.
- I don't know about this, boss.

16:49.079 --> 16:52.080
- I said take it.
- No, I'm not gonna do it.

16:52.082 --> 16:54.618
What are you, a Mormon, huh?
Jesus freak?

16:55.720 --> 16:58.990
- I'm lactose intolerant, man.
- Lactose intolerant.

17:00.558 --> 17:04.463
You think that dealers care
if you lactose intolerant, huh?

17:05.296 --> 17:07.132
- You care if he lactose intolerant?
- <i>No, señor.</i>

17:07.565 --> 17:09.565
<i>No, señor.</i> Huh?

17:09.567 --> 17:11.700
You a goddamn disgrace,
rookie.

17:11.702 --> 17:13.201
I don't want you
as my partner,

17:13.203 --> 17:15.304
on the squad,
or on the force.

17:15.306 --> 17:18.477
You can go back to parking
tricycles at Chuck E. Cheese.

17:19.210 --> 17:22.144
What's so important about
your snake anyway, Vurkel?

17:22.146 --> 17:24.880
My invention super charged it
with unstable molecules,

17:24.882 --> 17:26.617
now it's growing
at an uncontrollable rate.

17:27.050 --> 17:28.787
And it could get bigger.

17:29.052 --> 17:31.755
Big enough to eat a person if
the molecules remain unstable.

17:32.322 --> 17:34.656
So... what you sayin' is,

17:34.658 --> 17:36.093
it's big enough
to eat this Twinkie.

17:36.726 --> 17:39.030
Dude, that's not
a big Twinkie.

17:39.664 --> 17:41.098
My Ding Dong is
bigger than that.

17:41.299 --> 17:43.033
Yeah.

17:43.267 --> 17:46.037
All right, everybody, let's help
this kid look for his damn snake.

17:48.172 --> 17:49.637
Fine, you want me
to do it, I'll do it.

17:49.639 --> 17:51.041
Gimme. Give it.

18:00.585 --> 18:03.555
My ninja.
That's how it's done, son.

18:04.120 --> 18:06.790
Oh, betrayed by your
virgin gag reflexes.

18:07.258 --> 18:08.824
Let me get in
on that shit.

18:13.763 --> 18:14.632
That's that good shit.

18:15.666 --> 18:18.133
Real cops don't spit.
Swallow that shit down.

18:18.135 --> 18:18.904
Swallow it.

18:20.338 --> 18:20.972
There.

18:23.340 --> 18:26.674
Oh, sweet. Guys, guys!

18:26.676 --> 18:27.977
Alley Jaws' AK.

18:27.979 --> 18:30.045
Don't I look
just like street,

18:30.047 --> 18:33.082
hip-hop, gangster,
OG, indica, like...

18:33.084 --> 18:34.319
Girl, do you even know
what you're sayin'?

18:35.520 --> 18:38.220
Yeah, I'm just trying to,
you know, like, represent.

18:38.222 --> 18:39.758
I'm just
trying to represent.

18:39.956 --> 18:41.091
<i>Pinche cabrón.</i>

18:50.967 --> 18:52.136
- Partner!
- Hmm?

18:52.636 --> 18:53.571
Crime in progress?

18:54.271 --> 18:57.338
Well, I'll be.
Little white girl with an AK.

18:57.340 --> 18:59.843
How cute.
Finish your damn ice cream.

19:02.113 --> 19:03.878
Don't be playing.
Give me that.

19:03.880 --> 19:05.816
It ain't a toy.
Come on, man.

19:06.651 --> 19:08.587
Too much been goin' on today
already, aright?

19:08.953 --> 19:11.353
Crime in progress! Crime in progress!
Get the car, rookie.

19:11.355 --> 19:13.821
Hey! You forgot
your ice cream!

19:13.823 --> 19:15.958
All right, drop the gun, son.
Drop the gun, son.

19:15.960 --> 19:18.192
- Easy, easy, easy, drop the gun, son.
- It's not mine, man.

19:18.194 --> 19:20.061
- Aright, aright.
- I understand. I understand.

19:20.063 --> 19:21.696
Get your stupid ass
on the ground.

19:21.698 --> 19:23.164
Down quick,
like your mama on Tuesday.

19:23.166 --> 19:25.034
Get down. Look that way.
Look that way.

19:25.036 --> 19:27.102
Aright, aright.
I told you, man, the gun ain't mine.

19:27.104 --> 19:29.872
Possession
of a stolen firearm, huh?

19:29.874 --> 19:31.309
You going down
to the booty house.

19:32.342 --> 19:33.875
All right, go ahead
and book him, rookie.

19:33.877 --> 19:36.114
Oh, ooh, ooh,
ooh, uh...

19:37.280 --> 19:39.917
How does one book,
exactly?

19:40.317 --> 19:41.482
It's your training day,
I get it.

19:41.484 --> 19:43.852
Daddy gotta do everything.
Put your hands behind your back.

19:43.854 --> 19:45.256
You can't arrest Cam!

19:45.455 --> 19:48.257
We got the biggest gig
of our lives tomorrow.

19:48.259 --> 19:50.291
You think I care
about you kids

19:50.293 --> 19:53.162
and your crunk dub-step
Bieber-believer bullshit?

19:53.164 --> 19:57.035
And if I had a dime for every
Compton rapper I arrested, I...

19:58.703 --> 19:59.867
I would have
a whole lot of dimes!

19:59.869 --> 20:00.838
Man, come on.

20:02.039 --> 20:05.106
Fame and fortune
are for the weak-minded.

20:05.108 --> 20:06.874
You wanna be powerful?

20:06.876 --> 20:09.010
You want real power, huh?

20:09.012 --> 20:11.012
You'll be a crooked cop
like me.

20:11.014 --> 20:12.780
- What?
- Crooked cop like me...

20:12.782 --> 20:13.481
No, no, no, regular cop.

20:13.483 --> 20:15.017
A regular cop...

20:15.019 --> 20:18.220
A super, upstanding cop cop.

20:18.222 --> 20:19.223
- Super up...
- You know what? Never mind.

20:21.725 --> 20:23.895
Y'all are really starting
to piss me off.

20:24.427 --> 20:27.128
Now get this trash off this
little white girl's lawn.

20:27.130 --> 20:29.097
Hey, yo, Cam is innocent.

20:29.099 --> 20:30.401
He was protecting us.

20:30.901 --> 20:32.800
How about you do your jobs
for a change?

20:32.802 --> 20:35.139
Man, shut your mouth, girl,
before you get locked up too, man.

20:38.008 --> 20:39.240
- Quiet!
- Just shut up.

20:39.242 --> 20:40.678
I decide who's innocent.

20:41.745 --> 20:43.415
- That's good.
- Ain't that right, Poindexter?

20:44.415 --> 20:45.783
- Me?
- Yeah.

20:46.117 --> 20:47.915
Oh, affirmative.
Cam's guilty.

20:47.917 --> 20:49.787
- What?
- What you?

20:50.053 --> 20:53.288
He used my mutated snake as a
weapon, and now it's disappeared.

20:53.290 --> 20:56.761
Ah, you see how that goes?
You got... a mutated snake?

20:56.961 --> 20:59.361
I invented a centrifugal
field generator

20:59.363 --> 21:01.332
that supercharged it
with unstable molecules...

21:04.868 --> 21:06.303
Cam!

21:06.971 --> 21:08.503
Yo, we're straight up
boned, Beez.

21:08.505 --> 21:11.442
Yo, yo, yo,
why don't we just bail out Cam?

21:12.108 --> 21:13.377
Oh, yeah? And with what money?

21:14.110 --> 21:15.176
You used it all
at the studio

21:15.178 --> 21:16.944
makin' those
stupid beats.

21:16.946 --> 21:18.282
Download next time,
stupid.

21:19.983 --> 21:22.217
Oh, my beats are stupid?
She said my beats are stupid.

21:22.219 --> 21:23.417
- She said my beats, my beats...
- Dumb. Idiotic.

21:23.419 --> 21:24.553
My beats, my beats are stupid?

21:24.555 --> 21:25.953
- Retarded.
- Oh, really?

21:25.955 --> 21:28.022
- Not understanding me?
- Well, my bad.

21:28.024 --> 21:31.762
Sorry if I wanted to make sure
the bass frequencies were bangin'!

21:32.396 --> 21:34.429
Why don't you just
bail out Cam?

21:34.431 --> 21:36.298
With the little money I
make I earn the hard way

21:36.300 --> 21:38.232
by putting in work.

21:38.234 --> 21:39.870
So until you can prove to me
that this rap shit will work,

21:40.069 --> 21:41.004
I'm out.

21:41.972 --> 21:43.305
Yo, R.E.L.s,
can you drop me off at the club?

21:43.307 --> 21:45.777
Yeah, sister,
I got your back. Yo!

21:46.176 --> 21:51.246
I did not get you that
audition at Uppercase

21:51.248 --> 21:54.986
just because I wanted to get
shwerp figgety on your snobelisk.

21:56.287 --> 21:58.886
I got it for you because
you and your crew,

21:58.888 --> 22:00.824
you got something
real special.

22:01.291 --> 22:05.928
I sure as hell hope you got some
money left over from Alley Jaws.

22:05.930 --> 22:08.366
At least enough to bail
Cam out by 3 p.m. tomorrow.

22:08.598 --> 22:10.100
Yo, R.E.L.s,
I'm a be late!

22:10.401 --> 22:11.970
Yeah, yo, I'm coming.

22:15.438 --> 22:19.910
Get your shit together.

22:25.382 --> 22:27.418
Menorah out.

22:34.023 --> 22:35.392
F that noise!

22:35.893 --> 22:40.265
We gonna bailout Cam,
and we gonna rock this audition!

22:40.496 --> 22:43.100
All right, well, how are we gonna
come up with this cash, man?

22:44.335 --> 22:45.400
<i>♪ Four, three, two, one ♪</i>

22:49.505 --> 22:52.039
Yo, man, I don't,
I don't know about this, Pin.

22:52.041 --> 22:54.378
Like, this is not something
that Cam would approve of, man.

22:55.011 --> 22:57.915
Cam ain't here!
Let's go.

23:00.984 --> 23:04.888
<i>♪ Damn, girl,
Your legs don't feel Like hot dogs ♪</i>

23:05.188 --> 23:07.623
Hey, man.
Thanks for doing the begging today.

23:07.625 --> 23:08.859
People are intolerant.

23:09.158 --> 23:10.224
We gotta stick together.

23:10.226 --> 23:12.260
Society's turned
a blind eye.

23:12.262 --> 23:15.329
That's why we gotta keep ours
open, keep our butts safe.

23:15.331 --> 23:19.166
You know what they say, open
eyes, open hearts, open butts.

23:19.168 --> 23:21.004
Ain't that the truth?

23:21.504 --> 23:23.540
Say, friend,
do you have any narcotics?

23:24.040 --> 23:25.242
Of course I do.

23:26.676 --> 23:28.109
It's why I'm homeless
in the first place.

23:28.111 --> 23:30.214
- Yeah.
- Addiction is ruining my life.

23:30.681 --> 23:31.316
Ha.

23:32.916 --> 23:34.916
Oh, this is my jam!

23:34.918 --> 23:35.953
Turn that up.

23:41.524 --> 23:44.092
Well, I'm getting tired.
I'm gonna go hit the sack.

23:44.094 --> 23:46.494
And I mean the literal sack
that I sleep in on the ground.

23:46.496 --> 23:48.031
You know, and I'll do
the same in a few.

23:49.532 --> 23:52.936
First, I gotta go defecate in public
since restrooms are for customers only.

24:12.690 --> 24:14.556
Not sure why anyone tries
to read arousing material

24:14.558 --> 24:16.027
while attempting
a bowel movement.

24:16.359 --> 24:17.361
It's weird.

24:19.629 --> 24:20.598
I'm still doing it, though.

24:27.972 --> 24:29.507
Oh, God!

24:34.645 --> 24:36.247
Get the hell out of my tent,
you homeless piece of shit.

24:36.713 --> 24:38.282
Help me.

24:46.357 --> 24:49.324
<i>Uppercase Records sports some of
the loudest sound systems available</i>

24:49.326 --> 24:51.727
<i>in all of Los Angeles,</i>

24:51.729 --> 24:54.997
<i>but the recent rooftop parties have left
some local residents less than impressed.</i>

24:54.999 --> 24:57.132
<i>Sir, what are your thoughts
on the noise?</i>

24:57.134 --> 25:00.104
This is a stick-up, sucker!
So stay cool!

25:03.139 --> 25:04.472
- Damn!
- Jesus!

25:04.474 --> 25:06.243
I am staying cool.

25:06.542 --> 25:08.378
Oh, you want to rob me?

25:08.678 --> 25:11.480
Don't be pussies.
You better fucking rob me!

25:11.482 --> 25:14.415
- Drop your weapon!
- Only after you shoot me.

25:14.417 --> 25:17.285
None of the other robbers
had the balls to shoot me!

25:17.287 --> 25:19.387
What's wrong with you, old man?
This is not how it's supposed to go.

25:19.389 --> 25:21.589
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with you?

25:21.591 --> 25:24.259
You didn't even ask
about the cash in the ATM!

25:24.261 --> 25:26.428
Or the money
in the safe in back!

25:26.430 --> 25:28.195
We're supposed to ask
those questions?

25:28.197 --> 25:30.097
Shoot me! Shoot me!

25:32.202 --> 25:34.439
You, oh!

25:35.472 --> 25:37.672
You wimpy girly man.

25:37.674 --> 25:39.376
You threw your gun at me?

25:41.578 --> 25:43.513
I didn't have any bullets,
that's the thing.

25:44.348 --> 25:47.417
You, shoot out
the security camera.

25:48.452 --> 25:49.785
And we can talk.

25:49.787 --> 25:52.753
Yeah, I...
I also forgot to load my gun.

25:52.755 --> 25:54.224
So dumb.

25:54.825 --> 25:56.458
He's shooting!

26:01.165 --> 26:02.596
Good job, my friends.

26:02.598 --> 26:06.136
So I recently took out
a large theft insurance policy.

26:06.502 --> 26:11.376
You will be providing my worthless
kids with a better future.

26:19.249 --> 26:23.387
Oh, and here's a crowbar
for the ATM machine.

26:31.861 --> 26:33.828
I thought you were
takin' us downtown, yo.

26:33.830 --> 26:34.732
Why we back here?

26:35.232 --> 26:36.634
Because, huh?

26:37.134 --> 26:38.599
I got a very important lesson

26:38.601 --> 26:40.335
to teach my rookie partner
here, huh?

26:40.337 --> 26:42.537
It's his first day
on the job.

26:42.539 --> 26:45.175
Yeah. And it's
my training day, too.

26:45.541 --> 26:47.409
Yeah, you told me
what today is, yo.

26:47.411 --> 26:49.577
Could y'all hurry the hell up
and book us, or whatever?

26:49.579 --> 26:51.313
I'm tired of breathin'
Vurkel's farts.

26:51.315 --> 26:52.482
It's not me.

26:53.317 --> 26:54.749
I know your scent,
Geordi La Forge.

26:54.751 --> 26:57.088
Don't play that silent
but deadly shit with me.

26:58.288 --> 26:59.624
Triflin', man, damn.

27:02.592 --> 27:04.125
So what's
the lesson, boss?

27:04.127 --> 27:04.729
Shh.

27:05.963 --> 27:08.732
There's a lot of homeless people,
hang out around this spot.

27:09.433 --> 27:11.866
Oh, yeah, easy targets.

27:11.868 --> 27:14.469
Oh, look at you.
I underestimated you, son.

27:14.471 --> 27:15.573
You're not as stupid
as you look.

27:15.873 --> 27:18.142
There still might be
some hope for you.

27:18.375 --> 27:22.544
So here's the thing, if you want to learn
to hassle people like a real cop, huh?

27:22.546 --> 27:24.415
You gotta start at the bottom.

27:25.281 --> 27:26.416
So get your nightstick out.

27:27.783 --> 27:30.353
These people will take
all kinds of abuse.

27:34.457 --> 27:36.194
Looks like somebody
already beat us to it.

27:44.835 --> 27:46.804
Is this the work
of some sick psycho-killer?

27:47.703 --> 27:50.441
- Are we going to investigate?
- Man, hell, no!

27:54.444 --> 27:56.481
Nobody cares about a bunch
of mutilated bums.

27:56.746 --> 27:58.115
And you can write that down.

27:59.282 --> 28:01.118
This city ain't capable
of handling this many leeches.

28:02.685 --> 28:06.256
How many leeches, exactly,
can the city handle, though?

28:07.191 --> 28:09.827
I will drag your ass up and down
the street by your baby nuts.

28:13.297 --> 28:15.763
Anyway, I say we forget
all this nonsense,

28:15.765 --> 28:17.766
go raid one of those
Asian massage parlors,

28:17.768 --> 28:18.933
get our almonds milked.

28:18.935 --> 28:20.602
Almonds milked.

28:20.604 --> 28:22.938
But first,
I need a Slurpee.

28:22.940 --> 28:23.641
Slurpee.

28:37.221 --> 28:39.156
We going downtown yet?
I ain't got all day.

28:41.925 --> 28:43.258
Going to
the convenience store.

28:43.260 --> 28:44.625
It's hot.

28:44.627 --> 28:45.795
Keep your mouth shut,
you might get a Slurpee.

28:50.533 --> 28:52.634
- What was that?
- I ain't hit shit. Let's roll.

29:03.413 --> 29:04.415
It might sting.

29:06.683 --> 29:09.186
I'm sorry I threw my
plastic piece at you, Yoon.

29:09.619 --> 29:11.488
From the back, you dummy.

29:15.959 --> 29:17.628
Do I have to do everything?

29:24.635 --> 29:27.368
If you guys were hardcore
street motherfuckers,

29:27.370 --> 29:28.869
you'd put an end
to my miserable life.

29:31.707 --> 29:33.907
Then I wouldn't have to deal
with my bitch of a wife.

29:33.909 --> 29:35.910
And shitty kids.

29:35.912 --> 29:38.012
Can't even play
video games themselves.

29:38.014 --> 29:40.714
They have to watch others
do it on fucking YouTube.

29:40.716 --> 29:43.917
Look, man, you don't gotta
give us all the cash.

29:43.919 --> 29:45.854
- Save some for yourself.
- Yeah, man.

29:45.856 --> 29:47.321
Buy your wife
something really nice.

29:47.323 --> 29:48.789
You don't even
know my wife.

29:52.863 --> 29:55.499
Her unibrow is so thick that
her forehead looks like a...

29:55.765 --> 29:57.500
caterpillar is
fucking her eyebrows.

29:58.668 --> 30:00.870
This mofo right here
is gangsta.

30:01.704 --> 30:02.572
Oh, it's on.

30:04.040 --> 30:05.775
Quick, go out the back door.

30:06.009 --> 30:07.612
I don't know anything!

30:10.446 --> 30:11.781
Back.

30:12.549 --> 30:13.884
- Oh, my God.
- Go, go, go, go!

30:15.251 --> 30:15.886
- Run! Pick up your feet.
- Go, go, go, go.

30:16.819 --> 30:18.586
- Shit.
- Go faster.

30:18.588 --> 30:21.658
Sir, do you speak English?

30:21.857 --> 30:24.828
- Run, run.
- Oh, shit!

30:25.361 --> 30:26.663
What the fuck?

30:28.598 --> 30:31.333
Don't worry,
I'll call the paramedics.

30:31.335 --> 30:33.471
No, just let me bleed out.

30:35.539 --> 30:38.408
Drop your weapons, pooh butts, huh?
Y'all forget something?

30:38.642 --> 30:41.476
Listen, cop,
there's somethin' out there.

30:41.478 --> 30:43.948
There's something in here.
I'm your worst nightmare.

30:44.447 --> 30:47.115
- But it's a giant snake, yo!
- A big snake.

30:47.117 --> 30:49.851
I eat snakes.
They call me Mongoose Mike.

30:49.853 --> 30:52.354
You crazy!
The snake out there, it's huge.

30:52.356 --> 30:53.621
It wants to bite us.

30:53.623 --> 30:55.457
It wants to bite...
I want to bite you, huh?

30:55.459 --> 30:56.761
I'm a wolf.

30:57.027 --> 30:59.661
In order to protect the
flock, you gotta be a wolf.

30:59.663 --> 31:01.332
It takes a wolf
to catch a wolf.

31:01.697 --> 31:03.698
And what I'm gonna do is,
I'm gonna skin you, huh?

31:03.700 --> 31:05.133
And I'm gonna wear you
like sheep's clothing.

31:05.135 --> 31:06.604
I'm gonna be in disguise.

31:07.671 --> 31:09.069
What?

31:09.071 --> 31:11.005
Come on. Get your
dumb asses over here.

31:11.007 --> 31:11.876
Come on. Come on!

31:15.011 --> 31:17.548
This is taking too long, man.
I'm ready to go, man.

31:20.483 --> 31:21.715
Holy Mary J. Blige.

31:21.717 --> 31:24.688
My big beautiful snake!

31:24.988 --> 31:27.422
- What the hell?
- Although she does look a little bit off.

31:27.424 --> 31:28.823
- You think?
- Yeah.

31:28.825 --> 31:29.960
I think she remembers me.

31:40.169 --> 31:41.970
I think she remembers me.

31:41.972 --> 31:44.105
Snakes can detect scents and
odors over great distances,

31:44.107 --> 31:46.444
and most people don't know
this, but I know...

31:46.675 --> 31:49.176
Oh! No, no, no!
I got you.

31:49.178 --> 31:52.413
- No! Oh, hell no!
- My baby. My baby.

31:52.415 --> 31:53.517
I love you.

31:56.653 --> 31:57.855
Oh, baby...

31:59.723 --> 32:00.790
Well, I'll be...

32:01.625 --> 32:03.894
A 2754-B.

32:04.761 --> 32:06.696
There's a code for a giant
snake eating a person?

32:07.496 --> 32:10.767
Specifies a reptile.
Not necessarily a snake.

32:13.470 --> 32:18.608
Okay, snake, drop the nerd,
unless this anaconda wants some.

32:19.142 --> 32:21.576
Oh, God!

32:21.578 --> 32:23.547
Wee! Ow.

32:28.018 --> 32:30.054
Dumb animal.

32:36.992 --> 32:37.761
Oh, shit.

32:44.600 --> 32:46.867
Fuck the police!

32:57.246 --> 32:58.515
You.

33:10.493 --> 33:11.462
Yo, I think we're free to go.

33:19.935 --> 33:21.638
Welcome to the booty house.

33:23.507 --> 33:24.873
Shit.

33:24.875 --> 33:26.807
I've gotta get in there.
Did you guys see my snake?

33:26.809 --> 33:29.711
Get your mutagen hands off me.

33:29.713 --> 33:30.947
That thing tried to eat you.

33:35.618 --> 33:37.050
Slippery when wet.

33:37.052 --> 33:38.252
You gotta help capture it
so I can run more tests.

33:38.254 --> 33:40.555
You are Franken-crazy!

33:40.557 --> 33:43.124
Yo, man, your lust for knowledge
has apparently driven you mad, man.

33:43.126 --> 33:44.094
Aha!

33:45.294 --> 33:49.232
Put your hands in the air
like you just don't care, now!

33:50.567 --> 33:52.203
All right, now, get over there.

33:55.171 --> 33:56.807
Where? This way?

33:57.106 --> 33:58.641
No, not over there. Over there.

33:59.943 --> 34:02.146
Oh, no, no.

34:03.280 --> 34:05.979
What you all waitin' on?
Get in, come on, let's go.

34:05.981 --> 34:08.149
Go, go, go, go.
Come on, man.

34:08.150 --> 34:09.683
- Get in.
- Let's get outta here, man.

34:09.685 --> 34:11.155
Hey, hey.

34:11.955 --> 34:13.591
Fuck yeah, sucker!

34:19.795 --> 34:21.165
Oh, my snake.

34:21.731 --> 34:23.501
My beautiful snake.

34:24.132 --> 34:24.934
Where are you?

34:29.304 --> 34:31.139
Damn it. They got away.

34:33.141 --> 34:36.813
- I'll radio for help.
- No, negative, rookie, huh?

34:37.013 --> 34:39.813
- This stays between us.
- You got it.

34:39.815 --> 34:41.018
- All right?
- Mm-hmm.

34:41.283 --> 34:43.750
I'm not gonna look
like some fool

34:43.752 --> 34:46.353
who let a couple of pooh-butt
asses steal his car.

34:46.356 --> 34:47.257
- No.
- No.

34:47.856 --> 34:49.025
Maybe...

34:51.793 --> 34:53.159
This is what I need.

34:53.161 --> 34:54.629
Goddamn litterbug.
Pick that shit up.

34:54.630 --> 34:56.029
May have gotten down
into the plumbing

34:56.031 --> 34:57.267
after it broke one of
the toilets back there.

35:02.705 --> 35:04.607
Yo, why we stoppin', C?

35:04.874 --> 35:07.207
- We gotta turn around.
- Turn around for what?

35:07.209 --> 35:09.377
Hit us with them thoughts, homie.
What are you talking about?

35:09.379 --> 35:11.178
I'm the reason
that snake got away.

35:11.180 --> 35:12.779
We gotta go back and stop it.

35:12.781 --> 35:15.350
Yo, we did not
set you out of jail

35:15.352 --> 35:17.951
to get eaten by no giant snake!

35:17.953 --> 35:20.754
Man, first off, you didn't bust me out.
I got myself out.

35:20.756 --> 35:23.658
And second, I'm not even gone
five minutes and y'all thuggin'?

35:23.660 --> 35:25.229
Knockin' over
convenience stores?

35:25.729 --> 35:27.694
We didn't even have
any real guns.

35:27.696 --> 35:29.930
We wasn't gonna hurt nobody.
We were just playin'.

35:29.932 --> 35:33.401
The cops, they have real guns,
and real training.

35:33.403 --> 35:35.403
Let them deal with the snake!

35:35.405 --> 35:37.575
See us, we rappers.

35:38.307 --> 35:40.610
We need to get ready
for our audition tomorrow.

35:41.810 --> 35:43.711
Look, Cam, man,
homie has a point, man.

35:43.713 --> 35:46.881
I would prefer to not
get eaten by a giant snake.

35:46.883 --> 35:50.685
- So, what we gonna do, Cam?
- What we gonna do, Cam?

35:50.687 --> 35:51.355
What we gonna do?

35:55.658 --> 35:56.392
Now?

35:56.892 --> 35:58.292
We're gonna go
get our girl Neon.

35:58.294 --> 35:59.961
We got an audition.

35:59.963 --> 36:01.332
- All right?
- That's what I'm talking about, man.

36:09.071 --> 36:10.807
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

36:11.341 --> 36:13.944
Your training day turning into a
real shit show, ain't it, rookie?

36:14.310 --> 36:15.843
Yeah, first
I lost my gun,

36:15.845 --> 36:17.278
and then they showed
me their buttocks.

36:17.280 --> 36:20.249
Yeah, never mind all that.
We got bigger fish to fry.

36:21.151 --> 36:24.419
We catch this snake,
and I'll be famous, huh?

36:24.421 --> 36:26.720
We talkin' about the cover
of <i>Time</i> magazine,

36:26.722 --> 36:28.221
maybe even YouTube.

36:28.223 --> 36:31.028
So the snake is stuck down
in the toilet hole.

36:31.361 --> 36:34.261
So what I need you to do is take
your shrimpy little girl hands,

36:34.263 --> 36:36.633
stick it down the drain,
and just...

36:38.001 --> 36:38.901
pull the snake out.

36:40.370 --> 36:41.805
- Down the drain?
- Mm-hmm.

36:42.472 --> 36:44.372
But poo poo
goes down there.

36:44.374 --> 36:47.308
And so will your job if you don't get
down there like a good little rookie

36:47.310 --> 36:49.113
and pull out that goddamn snake!

36:53.348 --> 36:54.151
Can you...

36:58.921 --> 37:00.287
Get down there!

37:00.289 --> 37:02.291
Get elbow deep
in those pipes, Mario.

37:05.127 --> 37:07.227
- Okay.
- You feel anything?

37:07.229 --> 37:09.932
No, no. I think...

37:10.300 --> 37:11.966
So you got it?

37:11.968 --> 37:14.035
I got it, I got it.

37:14.037 --> 37:16.002
Whatever you do, you treat it
like your first piece of pussy,

37:16.004 --> 37:17.171
and you never let it go.

37:17.173 --> 37:18.274
You hold onto that snake!

37:21.243 --> 37:22.979
Come on! Come on, rook!

37:25.314 --> 37:28.084
I think that's all of it.

37:30.153 --> 37:31.021
Come on, man!

37:33.423 --> 37:35.125
This shit just got personal.

37:36.191 --> 37:39.829
Oh, God. I lost my watch!

37:48.403 --> 37:52.943
Experiment backfired.
Infected by snake saliva.

37:53.943 --> 37:57.314
Human DNA molecules are broken down
by unstable reptilian molecules.

37:58.414 --> 37:59.316
Let's make an antidote.

38:29.144 --> 38:32.412
Cam, I thought you were in jail.

38:32.414 --> 38:34.582
- Early release.
- Then why'd you come in here?

38:34.584 --> 38:37.017
Look, you know I don't like you
comin' in my place of work.

38:37.019 --> 38:38.986
- Now, you need to...
- Neon, we need you to come with us.

38:38.988 --> 38:40.287
You need to get out
of here right now.

38:40.289 --> 38:41.824
- Neon.
- Oh, hell no.

38:43.059 --> 38:46.593
You mofos have a lot of nerve
showing your asses in here.

38:46.595 --> 38:47.497
Your dough.

38:48.832 --> 38:50.100
As promised.

38:50.600 --> 38:53.000
We appreciate the loan,
but she's comin' with us.

38:53.002 --> 38:55.038
I already paid
for my full half hour.

38:56.305 --> 38:58.906
I ain't taking no for an answer.
She's done with you.

38:58.908 --> 39:00.941
- Yeah, come on.
- Fuck you, Cam, this is my job.

39:00.943 --> 39:03.012
We sign to Uppercase tomorrow,
you won't have to do this no more.

39:03.546 --> 39:05.946
That's hella rich, homeboy.

39:05.948 --> 39:06.816
Hella rich.

39:07.316 --> 39:10.086
Well, since you killed my boner,

39:11.386 --> 39:14.955
why don't we settle this
right here, right now.

39:14.957 --> 39:17.124
There's nothin' to settle.
I just came to get my girl.

39:17.126 --> 39:18.394
I'm not your girl, remember?

39:19.562 --> 39:21.962
She's my girl, like a homegirl.
You know what I mean.

39:21.964 --> 39:23.267
She's a key part of the crew.

39:24.234 --> 39:26.970
If you are such
a goddamn artist,

39:27.437 --> 39:28.970
why don't you
bust a rhyme right now?

39:28.972 --> 39:30.174
You?

39:31.039 --> 39:32.874
- No, you.
- You?

39:32.876 --> 39:34.475
- You. You.
- You?

39:34.477 --> 39:37.245
You standin' right here
in this very spot

39:37.247 --> 39:38.915
in this strip club,
steppin' to me?

39:39.515 --> 39:42.152
Any moron can bust
a rhyme, right?

39:42.551 --> 39:45.254
Oh!

39:45.488 --> 39:47.888
- Okay, we doing it?
- Mm-hmm.

39:47.890 --> 39:49.323
- We doin' it right.
- We're doing it now.

39:49.325 --> 39:52.593
- Let's get it.
- Get the fuck out of my way.

39:52.595 --> 39:55.263
All right, you people.
Yo, yo, yo, yo!

39:55.265 --> 39:59.466
Excuse me while I interrupt
your regularly scheduled tittays

39:59.468 --> 40:04.971
to call out this wannabe,
poser rapper Cam.

43:09.124 --> 43:13.329
Ho door. Ho door. Ho door.
Ho door. Ho door. Ho door.

43:26.776 --> 43:27.810
Holy shit!

Go, go, go, go!

43:47.796 --> 43:48.830
What do we do, boss?

43:48.832 --> 43:52.335
Uh... I'll run that way,
you bitches run that way.

43:54.236 --> 43:56.837
- But we should stick together!
- No, no, no, no.

43:56.839 --> 43:58.575
That's exactly what the snake
wants you to do.

44:00.475 --> 44:04.145
Ready? Run in a zig-zag.
Go! Go! Go!

44:04.147 --> 44:05.715
I love you! Go!

44:16.792 --> 44:18.127
Show me what you got, snake.

44:24.367 --> 44:27.303
Yo, I need to borrow this.

44:29.238 --> 44:31.875
Very nice boobs, by the way.
You won the DNA lottery.

44:39.347 --> 44:40.382
That's all you got?

44:41.816 --> 44:44.153
I've had penny rides at the grocery
store that are better than this.

44:52.894 --> 44:54.396
Back up. Back!

44:55.363 --> 44:56.566
Cam, wake up, man.

44:58.301 --> 44:59.566
You think I'm scared of you?

44:59.568 --> 45:01.301
I done sucked dicks
bigger than you,

45:01.303 --> 45:04.307
and they went crying home
to their mama, too. Back up.

45:13.348 --> 45:15.184
Let off some steam, snake.

45:18.955 --> 45:20.223
- Girl!
- Cam?

45:21.356 --> 45:22.522
- Baby, wake up.
- Cam? Come on, Cam.

45:22.524 --> 45:25.225
- Time to wake up!
- Come on, man.

45:25.227 --> 45:27.595
- Cam.
- Wake up, wake up, wake up.

45:27.597 --> 45:29.598
- Wake up.
- Cam!

45:39.874 --> 45:42.211
Oh, shit, Tupac.

45:42.477 --> 45:44.647
Greetings and salutations,
Cameron.

45:45.747 --> 45:48.649
Biggie Smalls,
the Notorious B.I.G.

45:48.651 --> 45:50.252
- What up, playa?
- Affirmative.

45:50.685 --> 45:52.689
And the same to you,
my good chap.

45:52.988 --> 45:55.891
Oh, man, I know what this is.
I'm dead, ain't I?

45:56.758 --> 45:59.762
Nah, you got pranked.
It's a dream sequence, man.

46:00.263 --> 46:01.495
So what are y'all saying?

46:01.497 --> 46:04.031
I prefer my dream sequences
to involve flying.

46:04.033 --> 46:06.933
Or banging my old babysitter,
Stephanie, on the couch,

46:06.935 --> 46:09.870
floatin' in a giant bowl
of macaroni and cheese.

46:09.872 --> 46:11.975
You must persevere,
my son.

46:12.508 --> 46:15.575
Go to the audition.
Let the world see your talent.

46:15.577 --> 46:17.913
That's what I did.
Look where it got me.

46:18.680 --> 46:20.950
I sold more albums
than anybody while I was dead.

46:21.417 --> 46:23.453
I mean, I'm still alive.

46:23.885 --> 46:26.020
Easy for you to say, Pac.

46:26.022 --> 46:28.888
You're not the one that's got some
dumbass snake messin' up your every move.

46:28.890 --> 46:29.825
Forget that snake.

46:30.993 --> 46:32.295
It's not your problem.

46:33.562 --> 46:36.629
Rutherford B.
Hayes, 19th President of the United States?

46:36.631 --> 46:37.997
Man, this doesn't
make any sense.

46:37.999 --> 46:39.767
What are y'all telling me to do?

46:39.769 --> 46:40.933
You're gonna have
to make a choice.

46:40.935 --> 46:42.872
Your fate is intertwined
with the snake.

46:43.439 --> 46:45.071
Like two snakes.

46:45.073 --> 46:47.674
Your mind is struggling
with choices, Cam.

46:47.676 --> 46:49.843
You've got another mission
to fulfill with your rap crew.

46:49.845 --> 46:52.446
Come on, Cam.
Go to the audition!

46:52.448 --> 46:54.415
Aright, this shit
doesn't make any sense.

46:54.417 --> 46:55.982
It was all a dream.

46:55.984 --> 46:58.886
Charlotte Bronte,
author of <i>Jane Eyre.</i>

46:58.888 --> 47:00.757
- Cam, come on, Cam.
- Rutherford B. Hayes!

47:02.091 --> 47:03.893
- He's come to.
- Cam!

47:04.660 --> 47:06.493
What... what happened?

47:06.495 --> 47:10.997
Dude... you got knocked
the friggity jiggity out!

47:10.999 --> 47:12.433
- What?
- Come on, let's get you inside.

47:12.435 --> 47:15.602
- Can you stand up?
- Of course I can stand up.

47:15.604 --> 47:16.740
- Come on.
- We got you.

47:18.106 --> 47:20.009
Oh, yeah. Come on.

47:24.046 --> 47:26.316
Not thessse people.

47:26.881 --> 47:29.918
They're so unsssivilized.

47:33.823 --> 47:36.693
Tonight has been
caca goo-goo!

47:36.926 --> 47:39.796
There is a snake
terrorizing Compton!

47:39.995 --> 47:41.665
Swallowing up people!

47:41.863 --> 47:45.367
And it squeezed titty juice
on my face.

47:46.035 --> 47:46.970
Titty juice!

47:48.671 --> 47:50.671
How are we gonna take care
of this snake?

47:50.673 --> 47:52.742
Perhaps I can stop it.

47:56.544 --> 47:57.414
Vurkel?

47:59.682 --> 48:01.482
What the hell happened to you?

48:01.484 --> 48:02.786
I was infected by the snake.

48:03.818 --> 48:05.419
I created an antidote

48:05.421 --> 48:08.488
that neutralizes the
unstable reptilian molecules,

48:08.490 --> 48:11.093
but I only could synthesize
enough for one large dose.

48:11.727 --> 48:13.160
I could use it to cure myself,

48:13.162 --> 48:14.897
or I can use it
to destroy the snake.

48:15.164 --> 48:17.464
Then make some more, Brainiac!

48:17.466 --> 48:19.868
You're not lissstening to me.

48:21.470 --> 48:25.638
The specific set of circumstances that
caused this mutation in the first place

48:25.640 --> 48:28.444
were so random that recreating the
same concoction could take months.

48:28.711 --> 48:29.678
You gotta make this right.

48:30.546 --> 48:31.879
You made the snake,

48:31.881 --> 48:34.113
it's your responsibility
to get rid of it.

48:34.115 --> 48:36.082
Nah, man, we gotta help.

48:36.084 --> 48:38.718
And you are in no
position to do anything.

48:38.720 --> 48:40.453
- I'm good, man, I'm good.
- Just relax.

48:40.455 --> 48:41.557
I'm cool.

48:45.127 --> 48:47.861
We're tore up, honey.
Can't you just bring it to the cops?

48:47.863 --> 48:49.863
The copsss, yes.

48:49.865 --> 48:51.935
Just be careful, Vurkel.

48:52.700 --> 48:55.836
You're really...
special to me.

48:55.838 --> 48:56.906
Don't worry about me, Neon.

48:57.939 --> 49:00.376
I know exsssactly who
to take it to.

49:02.010 --> 49:06.180
Well, well, well.
Look who decided to turn himself in.

49:06.182 --> 49:09.785
I know how to
ssstop the sssnake.

49:11.453 --> 49:14.488
If you inject the serum
directly into the snake's heart,

49:14.490 --> 49:17.624
it should neutralize the unstable
molecules that made it grow.

49:17.626 --> 49:19.660
Okay, son, calm down.

49:19.662 --> 49:22.595
Go ahead and pat yourself
on the scales, Egon Spengler,

49:22.597 --> 49:25.098
because you made
the right decision coming here.

49:25.100 --> 49:30.073
And I'll always, always reward
those who make the right decision.

49:32.008 --> 49:34.475
- Holy shit!
- Shut up, rookie.

49:34.477 --> 49:36.042
He was a violent offender

49:36.044 --> 49:38.245
that already
escaped custody once.

49:38.247 --> 49:40.580
We gotta do this together.

49:40.582 --> 49:42.684
You know the department
would just bone this up.

49:43.952 --> 49:45.788
So grab that
syringe of mutagen.

49:46.055 --> 49:47.553
What are we gonna do?

49:47.555 --> 49:49.758
We're gonna get
that snake outta Compton.

49:57.999 --> 49:58.834
Okay, let's roll.

50:00.935 --> 50:03.236
Hey, clean up that shit
in the interrogation room.

50:03.238 --> 50:05.238
I had to ice
a violent suspect back there.

50:05.240 --> 50:08.575
Pow! We out, bitches! Huh?

50:08.577 --> 50:11.481
Gotta go solve a particular
ongoin' investigation.

50:11.680 --> 50:13.113
Don't we have a lot
of paperwork to do?

50:13.115 --> 50:14.781
I mean, he was unarmed and all,

50:14.783 --> 50:16.283
and you kind
of discharged your weapon.

50:16.285 --> 50:18.986
Rookie, if we had
to fill out paperwork

50:18.988 --> 50:21.220
every time we shot
an unarmed black man,

50:21.222 --> 50:23.459
we would never get to
have any fun around here.

50:23.859 --> 50:24.894
Right, guys?

50:26.394 --> 50:28.995
But, what about the security camera
footage in the interrogation room?

50:28.997 --> 50:30.867
I mean,
it clearly shows you...

50:32.234 --> 50:35.071
Goddamn rookies, huh?
Am I right?

50:35.771 --> 50:37.136
Listen up, fellas.

50:37.138 --> 50:39.939
You might see
some video evidence, huh?

50:39.941 --> 50:41.144
But don't believe
the camera.

50:41.709 --> 50:42.978
He went for my gun.

50:46.981 --> 50:50.185
Wow. Being a cop is awesome!

50:51.053 --> 50:53.857
Come on, dumbass.
We got a snake to go get got.

51:00.229 --> 51:01.328
I can't wait for the day

51:01.330 --> 51:03.266
cops start cleaning up
after their own fucking murders.

51:04.033 --> 51:05.702
Betrayed!

51:06.234 --> 51:07.202
Nope.

51:18.347 --> 51:22.616
<i>But you're a hero to me.
You're really... special.</i>

51:22.618 --> 51:23.219
Neon.

51:28.624 --> 51:29.826
What an asshole.

51:34.997 --> 51:36.796
- Hold on.
- Really?

51:36.798 --> 51:38.332
All right, there we go,
there we go.

51:38.334 --> 51:42.703
Look, put your hat on
and nobody will even notice.

51:42.705 --> 51:43.706
Thanks, girl.

51:44.073 --> 51:45.542
I'm feeling better, but...

51:46.008 --> 51:47.240
I don't need you
to be there for me.

51:47.242 --> 51:48.611
I know you don't,
but I like to.

51:49.243 --> 51:51.146
Makes me feel all motherly
or somethin'.

51:51.680 --> 51:53.747
Those boys might need
mothering, but not me.

51:53.749 --> 51:55.115
I'm a grown-ass man.

51:55.117 --> 51:57.086
Why you gotta act so hard
all the time, Cam?

51:57.720 --> 51:58.884
Growing up in
these streets,

51:58.886 --> 52:00.620
there... there ain't
no time to be soft.

52:00.622 --> 52:04.323
When things get tough,
a man's gotta walk hard.

52:04.325 --> 52:05.227
Hmm.

52:06.194 --> 52:09.966
Well... I'm about to
make things real tough.

52:12.100 --> 52:15.671
So I can see just
how hard you can get.

52:15.970 --> 52:17.703
But there's
a snake outside.

52:17.705 --> 52:19.309
Oh, and there's
a snake in here.

52:19.874 --> 52:21.843
And we got that audition tomorrow.
We should rehearse.

52:22.377 --> 52:24.013
Oh, I'm done rehearsin'.

52:24.647 --> 52:26.779
<i>♪ I'm surrounded
By these people ♪</i>

52:26.781 --> 52:29.015
<i>♪ But I feel like I'm alone ♪</i>

52:29.017 --> 52:31.183
<i>♪ What there is
All that is stylin' ♪</i>

52:31.185 --> 52:32.986
<i>♪ If I never let it show ♪</i>

52:32.988 --> 52:34.256
Betrayed.

52:36.124 --> 52:37.593
Betrayed!

52:56.444 --> 52:58.814
- What was that?
- I don't hear anything.

52:59.113 --> 52:59.948
Girl, you deaf?

53:00.883 --> 53:01.917
Most def.

53:32.481 --> 53:34.850
Oh, yes, bitch! Oh!

53:44.760 --> 53:48.361
Get your stinkin' friggity
diggity ass off of my couch!

53:51.466 --> 53:52.434
Damn!

53:53.368 --> 53:55.203
Everybody gettin'
their freak on but me!

53:56.738 --> 53:57.439
Lie to me.

54:06.013 --> 54:07.814
What in the name of ODB?

54:12.921 --> 54:14.386
Vurkel, what the hell
are you doing?

54:15.457 --> 54:17.260
Goddamn it, Vurkel.

54:17.526 --> 54:19.294
For Christ's sake,
use a condom.

54:19.495 --> 54:23.062
You said I was a hero.
That I was special.

54:23.064 --> 54:26.031
Vurkel, you are special to me,
but this is getting out of hand!

54:26.033 --> 54:28.368
I'll show you
what is out of hand.

54:28.370 --> 54:29.772
Let her go, you freak!

54:30.238 --> 54:31.941
What, you think
you can take me?

54:34.376 --> 54:35.377
Cam, it's the snake.

54:36.178 --> 54:38.211
My snake would never
harm me.

54:38.213 --> 54:39.781
Let's hope you right.

54:39.981 --> 54:41.184
Now, what did you do
with your mutagen?

54:42.383 --> 54:45.722
Those crooked cops.
They stole my serum.

54:48.457 --> 54:50.827
Okay.
So here's the plan.

54:52.361 --> 54:55.562
We know the snake is
attracted to bass, huh?

54:55.564 --> 54:57.430
And we know that
Uppercase Records

54:57.432 --> 55:00.267
has the biggest sound
system in Los Angeles

55:00.269 --> 55:02.301
for their private
rooftop demos.

55:02.303 --> 55:04.870
So what we're gonna do is
draw that big black bitch

55:04.872 --> 55:07.307
on top of the roof,
and blow her big ass up.

55:07.309 --> 55:08.908
And then, I'm gonna get
all the press,

55:08.910 --> 55:10.576
I'm talking about all of it,
and all the promotions.

55:10.578 --> 55:12.879
Uh, shouldn't we call
for backup, though?

55:12.881 --> 55:14.984
Ain't nothing but shit
between your ears, son, huh?

55:16.118 --> 55:17.453
- Get in there.
- Let's go.

55:18.252 --> 55:19.187
Come on, man.

55:20.222 --> 55:21.555
- Stay here and shut up.
- What?

55:21.557 --> 55:22.992
- Damn.
- Stop hissin'.

55:23.325 --> 55:25.024
We gotta get
to the police station.

55:25.026 --> 55:28.928
Bus driver, put this thing on
OJ Simpson white Bronco speed

55:28.930 --> 55:30.596
and get us
the hell outta here!

55:30.598 --> 55:31.533
Now, why, I...

55:32.301 --> 55:35.438
Oh, holy shit.
What the fuck?

55:36.872 --> 55:38.071
All right,
time to get out of here.

55:38.073 --> 55:38.904
Pedal to the metal,
let's go.

55:48.350 --> 55:49.950
- Man, just stay here.
- Shut up.

55:49.952 --> 55:52.017
- I'll get my revenge.
- That's enough.

55:52.019 --> 55:54.120
- Hey, tie him up.
- Tie him up?

55:54.122 --> 55:55.158
Tie him up with what?

55:55.923 --> 55:57.292
Use Beez Neez's belt.

55:57.593 --> 56:00.863
Yo, Cam, my trousers gonna
drop if you use my belt.

56:01.562 --> 56:03.562
Come on, man,
can't this stupid bus go any faster?

56:03.564 --> 56:05.165
Don't wanna touch him.

56:05.167 --> 56:07.033
Why don't you be the first
bus that doesn't cause traffic

56:07.035 --> 56:08.468
and get
this bitch moving!

56:08.470 --> 56:10.437
This is the power
of Christ compels you.

56:10.439 --> 56:12.205
The power of Christ
compels you.

56:12.207 --> 56:14.274
You know what?

56:14.276 --> 56:16.042
The LADOT doesn't pay me
nearly enough for this shit!

56:16.044 --> 56:17.611
You deal with
the giant fucking snake,

56:17.613 --> 56:18.381
how about that?

56:18.647 --> 56:19.148
Fine.

56:22.316 --> 56:23.084
Finally.

56:26.120 --> 56:28.323
Oh, my God!

56:30.626 --> 56:31.560
Hit the gas, Neon.

56:36.964 --> 56:37.999
Oh, shit.

56:46.040 --> 56:47.008
Sorry!

56:55.082 --> 56:56.616
Oh, dude, it's on us!

56:56.618 --> 56:59.051
It's on top of us,
what are we gonna do?

56:59.053 --> 57:00.622
Faster, Neon, come on!
Punch that shit!

57:05.026 --> 57:06.926
Cam, Cam,
the bridge is out!

57:06.928 --> 57:08.430
What are we gonna do, Cam?

57:08.629 --> 57:11.298
- I got some plans, yo.
- What's the plan?

57:11.300 --> 57:12.267
We jumpin' the gap.

57:14.002 --> 57:15.104
That's the plan?

57:15.636 --> 57:17.537
Oh, shit!

57:17.539 --> 57:18.406
We can do this.

57:19.573 --> 57:20.976
Trousers be damned!

57:35.256 --> 57:36.325
Vurkel, come on!

57:37.993 --> 57:39.161
He don't wanna go. Let's go.

57:57.011 --> 57:58.211
- Go.
- Come on!

57:58.213 --> 57:59.048
Shit.

58:00.548 --> 58:02.314
Oh, my God, we made it.

58:02.316 --> 58:03.549
Yes!

58:03.551 --> 58:05.584
- I still have my legs.
- Yeah, baby!

58:05.586 --> 58:07.455
- Oh, yeah.
- We did that.

58:11.359 --> 58:13.258
Yeah! Yeah!

58:13.260 --> 58:15.528
Suck on these balls, snake.

58:15.530 --> 58:16.932
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

58:17.499 --> 58:19.669
Oh, Beez Neez,
nice underwear, man.

58:20.334 --> 58:21.567
- Oh, shit.
- Yo, yo, yo.

58:21.569 --> 58:24.571
Yo, we left Vurkel
on the bus.

58:24.573 --> 58:26.475
- Yeah.
- 'Cause his face turned into a snake.

58:42.323 --> 58:45.091
Yo. Yo! Yo!

58:45.093 --> 58:47.227
Y'all can't be comin' up here
without a warrant.

58:47.229 --> 58:50.399
Boss! These assholes,
they be trippin'!

58:50.698 --> 58:52.600
Cut the hood act, white girl.
We got business.

58:53.100 --> 58:54.569
Okay, all right.

58:54.769 --> 58:58.604
Anybody not looking to get
tossed off the roof head first

58:58.606 --> 59:00.342
best exit directly.

59:01.176 --> 59:03.542
Excuse me.

59:03.544 --> 59:04.544
Who the hell
do you think you are?

59:04.546 --> 59:06.446
This is my building.
I'll have you arrested.

59:06.448 --> 59:07.814
I know all the cops.

59:07.816 --> 59:09.448
- I know the best cops.
- Yeah.

59:09.450 --> 59:11.151
- I am the best cop.
- Oh, yeah?

59:11.153 --> 59:11.988
- Dumbass.
- Dumbass.

59:13.187 --> 59:15.354
Now, I don't have time
for your shit,

59:15.356 --> 59:18.491
so you best exit directly,
or get dumped on your head.

59:18.493 --> 59:19.595
- Yeah, yeah!
- No?

59:22.497 --> 59:25.732
Oh, God! What do I pay you for?

59:25.734 --> 59:27.332
What are you, nuts?
I'm not gonna hit a cop.

59:27.334 --> 59:28.667
Get this piece of shit
out of here.

59:28.669 --> 59:30.271
On yo head!

59:30.671 --> 59:32.205
- Okay, rookie.
- Yeah?

59:32.207 --> 59:33.372
- Get on the turntables, all right?
- Okay.

59:33.374 --> 59:34.506
Then what we gotta do is

59:34.508 --> 59:36.442
we gotta get
that giant snake up here

59:36.444 --> 59:39.446
so I can inject this into
his dumbass heart, all right?

59:39.448 --> 59:41.150
Now, here's
the whole plan.

59:41.749 --> 59:43.549
Get your ass
back over here.

59:43.551 --> 59:46.222
Here's the whole plan
in detail.

59:56.298 --> 59:59.432
- Now, feast, my pet.
- Get your damn snake, Vurkel.

59:59.434 --> 01:00:03.203
- What the...
- Oh, my God.

01:00:03.205 --> 01:00:04.407
- No way.
- Oh, okay.

01:00:06.374 --> 01:00:08.140
Now what do we do,
Cam?

01:00:08.142 --> 01:00:11.280
Now you'll all bow down
to my superior genes!

01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:14.314
Hey, maybe he's gonna bang that
snake again and not eat us, right?

01:00:14.316 --> 01:00:15.684
You all made fun of me.

01:00:16.218 --> 01:00:18.453
And you,
you played with my heart.

01:00:18.886 --> 01:00:22.357
- Me? What?
- You shall suffer most of all.

01:00:36.504 --> 01:00:38.606
Hey, wait, hey, snake.

01:00:40.642 --> 01:00:41.477
No.

01:00:43.778 --> 01:00:46.714
Hey, snake, no!

01:00:50.218 --> 01:00:51.553
Listen to me!

01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:54.155
Listen to me.

01:00:57.292 --> 01:00:58.828
Listen to me.

01:01:02.897 --> 01:01:04.834
Well, I mean,
the situation is improving.

01:01:05.533 --> 01:01:07.236
Albeit by
convenient means.

01:01:18.345 --> 01:01:19.647
Oh, it is me.

01:01:20.481 --> 01:01:22.314
- Oh, excuse me one second.
- You gonna answer it?

01:01:22.316 --> 01:01:24.883
- Yeah, excuse me.
- Who could you possibly...

01:01:24.885 --> 01:01:27.722
<i>♪ Hello?
Is it me you're looking for? ♪</i>

01:01:28.323 --> 01:01:30.756
Listen, there are
those crooked 5-0 up here.

01:01:30.758 --> 01:01:32.725
Yeah, you know,
the ones that arrested Cam?

01:01:32.727 --> 01:01:35.194
<i>Yeah, they're yellin'
about some snake or something.</i>

01:01:35.196 --> 01:01:36.930
The roof?
They're on the roof?

01:01:36.932 --> 01:01:39.332
- Who's up on the roof?
- The crooked cops.

01:01:39.334 --> 01:01:40.966
They on the roof
of the record company.

01:01:40.968 --> 01:01:43.472
Ask if they got that vial
of anti-mutagen with them.

01:01:43.872 --> 01:01:46.872
All right, baby, do they have
the big syringe?

01:01:46.874 --> 01:01:48.543
Yeah, no, I see it.

01:01:48.776 --> 01:01:51.243
It's got like
glowin' blue shit in there.

01:01:51.245 --> 01:01:53.279
All of it? All right, tell her to
lay low and wait for the cavalry.

01:01:53.281 --> 01:01:54.346
We en route.

01:01:54.348 --> 01:01:55.415
All right, look, baby,

01:01:55.417 --> 01:01:56.749
I don't want you
to get hurt.

01:01:56.751 --> 01:01:59.352
Lay low, as low
as you can go.

01:01:59.354 --> 01:02:01.256
Man, just tell her what
I said and let's go.

01:02:01.689 --> 01:02:03.455
Just be careful,
we're on our way.

01:02:03.457 --> 01:02:04.857
Aright, we goin',
come on.

01:02:04.859 --> 01:02:07.796
Bitch, didn't I tell you
to get off the roof?

01:02:09.664 --> 01:02:11.464
Oh, you running now,
huh?

01:02:11.466 --> 01:02:12.468
I thought you was street, baby.

01:02:13.334 --> 01:02:14.767
This is how we play.

01:02:16.271 --> 01:02:17.805
Huh? I'm a wolf!

01:02:22.377 --> 01:02:23.843
Keep playing the music, rookie.

01:02:23.845 --> 01:02:25.444
Oh, uh, sorry.

01:02:25.446 --> 01:02:27.448
I'm gonna deal with little
Miss Anne Funk over here.

01:02:28.383 --> 01:02:30.486
- Anne Funk?
- Yeah, it's like a Jewish...

01:02:30.818 --> 01:02:32.752
you know,
like Anne Frank, right?

01:02:32.754 --> 01:02:34.754
Except like some urban shit,
like a urban twist to it.

01:02:34.756 --> 01:02:36.524
Like, you know, is it too soon?

01:02:37.926 --> 01:02:40.026
You know what?
You just keep playing the music,

01:02:40.028 --> 01:02:41.363
and I'm gonna deal
with her, all right?

01:02:43.397 --> 01:02:45.999
Your hood rat ass really gonna make
me climb this damn ladder and shit?

01:02:46.001 --> 01:02:49.305
No, no, I'm not a hood rat.
I'm a phony.

01:02:49.803 --> 01:02:54.006
See? I'm a scared white girl.
I'm very confused.

01:02:57.312 --> 01:02:57.746
Hey, partner?

01:02:59.546 --> 01:03:01.848
I think something's happening
down on the street.

01:03:08.055 --> 01:03:11.359
I got it.
Snake, this is fucking crazy!

01:03:16.363 --> 01:03:17.566
Don't mind me.

01:03:22.504 --> 01:03:23.806
What are you doing?

01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:29.510
You don't need
that sound anymore.

01:03:30.444 --> 01:03:32.247
You've got me!

01:03:38.019 --> 01:03:41.256
All right, rookie.
Get ready to see some shit.

01:03:55.102 --> 01:03:56.371
Oh, my God!

01:03:56.671 --> 01:03:59.805
Game over, man. Game over!

01:03:59.807 --> 01:04:03.544
Once I inject this syringe
into this snake's dumbass heart,

01:04:03.845 --> 01:04:05.613
- then it's game over.
- Maybe she's right!

01:04:05.979 --> 01:04:08.381
You know,
about the game being over?

01:04:08.383 --> 01:04:12.855
No, negative, rookie.
It's time to pump up the jam.

01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:14.555
Th-That's this one.

01:04:20.761 --> 01:04:22.729
Oh, wait, wait, listen, kid.

01:04:22.731 --> 01:04:24.564
Just leave your mix tape
with me.

01:04:24.566 --> 01:04:27.303
- Carl, send backup!
- Thank your mama.

01:04:35.709 --> 01:04:37.944
<i>HQ, there are some fucking
civilians on the rooftop, over.</i>

01:04:37.946 --> 01:04:39.511

01:04:46.488 --> 01:04:48.857
No! Hey, this is my snake!

01:04:50.425 --> 01:04:53.625
I have the power!

01:04:53.627 --> 01:04:55.461

couldn't get any worse.

01:05:27.928 --> 01:05:29.595
What the hell are you
pussies doin' here?

01:05:29.597 --> 01:05:31.596
Pussies? Man,
we're here to stop this snake.

01:05:31.598 --> 01:05:33.702
You whack goosebump!

01:05:34.068 --> 01:05:36.769
You sent your girls to the back
while you snuck in the back!

01:05:36.771 --> 01:05:39.004
You watch, I'll kill you!
I will kill you!

01:05:39.006 --> 01:05:39.839
- I'll kill you!
- Hey, Jaws.

01:05:39.841 --> 01:05:41.640
Say it to my face.
Say that to my face.

01:05:41.642 --> 01:05:42.841
I'm sorry
about your girls,

01:05:42.843 --> 01:05:44.847
but Pinball didn't mean
any disrespect.

01:05:45.213 --> 01:05:47.850
Peace to your girls.
They really had what it took.

01:05:50.984 --> 01:05:52.785
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:05:52.787 --> 01:05:55.154
Oh, my God,
I appreciate that so much.

01:05:55.156 --> 01:05:56.955
You have no idea
what I go through.

01:05:56.957 --> 01:05:58.860
I'm just a shadow of myself.
I'm a lie!

01:06:01.129 --> 01:06:03.162
My daddy,
you don't know my daddy.

01:06:03.164 --> 01:06:05.230
I'd love to hear more about
it, but we don't have the time.

01:06:05.232 --> 01:06:06.232
- We got to roll.
- But I...

01:06:06.234 --> 01:06:08.136
But hey, to be
continued, though.

01:06:11.539 --> 01:06:12.173
Tell you what, Cam.

01:06:13.508 --> 01:06:14.776
Show us what you can do, dog.

01:06:16.010 --> 01:06:17.176
- Show us what you can do.
- All right y'all, come on, man.

01:06:17.178 --> 01:06:17.980
Let's go.

01:06:18.946 --> 01:06:21.580
- Hey, stop, freeze right there!
- Oh, hey.

01:06:21.582 --> 01:06:23.616
Yeah! He said to
freeze right there.

01:06:23.618 --> 01:06:25.651
- I'm not even...
- Freeze there! You too, nobody move!

01:06:25.653 --> 01:06:27.019
Hey, hey, you pigs!

01:06:28.856 --> 01:06:30.622
- Hey!
- Hey, Cam, go get them!

01:06:30.624 --> 01:06:32.093
- I got the bacon!
- Hey!

01:06:44.906 --> 01:06:45.741
What the...

01:06:47.941 --> 01:06:50.845
Ugh. Are they dead?

01:06:52.647 --> 01:06:54.846
I feel real bad for the dead.

01:06:54.848 --> 01:06:55.917
This ain't gonna happen
to us, is it?

01:06:58.653 --> 01:06:59.321
Go... fuck off.

01:07:04.725 --> 01:07:06.926
Man, up the stairs.
Take the stairs.

01:07:15.736 --> 01:07:17.972
No, don't shoot, no.

01:07:19.006 --> 01:07:20.575
- No!
- Get him, partner.

01:07:22.142 --> 01:07:24.847
Okay, snake, come on.
Come get some, huh?

01:07:30.151 --> 01:07:33.084
Your powers are weak,
old snake, huh?

01:07:33.086 --> 01:07:35.754
Come on, sister.
Okay, hey, hey, hey!

01:07:35.756 --> 01:07:37.823
Cross this line,
and I'm gonna tax that ass.

01:07:37.825 --> 01:07:39.258
I guarantee you that, huh?

01:07:39.260 --> 01:07:42.093
Taxation without representation.

01:07:42.095 --> 01:07:44.296
Come on, snake, come on.
Come get some.

01:07:44.298 --> 01:07:46.165
Will you quit playing
with yourself

01:07:46.167 --> 01:07:48.170
and shank that snake!

01:07:49.803 --> 01:07:52.573
Yeah, all right, I got you.

01:08:31.645 --> 01:08:34.982
Godzilla ain't got shit on me.

01:08:38.352 --> 01:08:39.252
Oh, God.

01:08:49.863 --> 01:08:51.263
- Oh, hell no.
- Vurkel?

01:08:51.265 --> 01:08:54.801
That's a lot
of teenage mutant ninja ugly.

01:08:56.370 --> 01:08:58.170
- Neon, you gotta appeal to his humanity.
- What?

01:08:58.171 --> 01:08:59.671
- Me?
- Yeah, talk to him, girl.

01:08:59.673 --> 01:09:00.943
Okay... hi.

01:09:01.876 --> 01:09:04.410
I'm sorry that you saw
Cam and I gettin' it on,

01:09:04.412 --> 01:09:07.380

a lot of respect

01:09:07.381 --> 01:09:09.381
for your love
for science.

01:09:09.383 --> 01:09:11.153
And um...

01:09:12.252 --> 01:09:15.624
I know that deep down inside
all of this snaky body there's,

01:09:15.856 --> 01:09:17.657
there's a great person.

01:09:17.658 --> 01:09:19.928
I think she's charming
the snake.

01:09:20.426 --> 01:09:23.064
Well, love is universal.

01:09:23.830 --> 01:09:24.996
Schmooze it in thick,
girl, go on.

01:09:24.997 --> 01:09:27.202
Okay, I... I love you?

01:09:28.035 --> 01:09:29.370
I really do,
and um...

01:09:29.935 --> 01:09:33.005
I hope you can feel...
feel the love.

01:09:33.006 --> 01:09:35.277
Love will set you free.

01:09:36.444 --> 01:09:39.944

always knew you could be.

01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:53.761

I hope he's fucking choking.

I think we've been fightin'
this for too long.

01:16:05.766 --> 01:16:08.536
I was so focused on my music
and my image, but...

01:16:09.203 --> 01:16:10.435
You're the real muse
I have.

01:16:10.437 --> 01:16:11.638
You're my missing piece.

01:16:12.373 --> 01:16:14.807
I've learned somethin' today.
I've changed. I learned that...

01:16:14.809 --> 01:16:15.776
Cam!

01:16:16.510 --> 01:16:19.247
Nobody cares
about your moral values.

01:16:20.213 --> 01:16:22.082
Let's make that money.

01:16:28.355 --> 01:16:30.121
Get it!

01:16:30.123 --> 01:16:32.090
You liked when I jumped
up and down on that thing?

01:16:32.092 --> 01:16:34.093
And R.E.L. was,
like, hangin' on?

01:16:34.095 --> 01:16:35.861
I love you very much.

01:16:35.863 --> 01:16:39.467
So R.E.L. this is the hip-hop group
you've been raving about, huh?

01:16:39.766 --> 01:16:41.068
Yeah, these be...

01:16:42.336 --> 01:16:43.504
This is Cam's crew.

01:16:45.839 --> 01:16:47.572
Gentlemen, I listened
to the whole thing.

01:16:47.574 --> 01:16:48.642
And it was Grade-A stuff.

01:16:50.477 --> 01:16:53.147
Needless to say,
this was the best audition I've ever seen.

01:16:53.513 --> 01:16:55.447
- What!
- Fuck, yeah.

01:16:55.449 --> 01:16:58.850
The sound, the performances,
it was very, very powerful.

01:16:58.852 --> 01:17:01.353
What you need is to be
signed by a label like ours.

01:17:05.860 --> 01:17:07.792
This is the energy
we've been looking for.

01:17:07.794 --> 01:17:10.464
Let's make this label
great again.

01:17:12.766 --> 01:17:13.467
Contracts.

01:17:14.568 --> 01:17:16.234
We getting contracts.

01:17:16.236 --> 01:17:17.638
Do you have
representation?

01:17:19.906 --> 01:17:20.441
Yeah.

01:17:22.676 --> 01:17:24.379
Yeah. Me.

01:17:24.878 --> 01:17:26.513
Hell, yeah,
she's our manager.

01:17:29.150 --> 01:17:29.484
All right.

01:17:31.886 --> 01:17:33.555
Oh, whoa.

01:17:34.254 --> 01:17:34.756
Cam.

01:17:36.323 --> 01:17:38.325
Cam, do you know
what you're do... Cam?

01:17:38.691 --> 01:17:42.193
Cam! She was just kissing
that reptile snake-man thing.

01:17:42.195 --> 01:17:45.397
Yo, yo, Pin, Pin!
Love is blind, homie.

01:17:45.399 --> 01:17:46.834
Love is blind.

01:17:47.434 --> 01:17:49.902
- Let's get the hell out of here.
- Word to your mother.

01:17:49.904 --> 01:17:54.273
Yeah,
let's give them some privacy.

01:17:54.275 --> 01:17:57.742
Um, I would like to discuss
the terms of this contract.

01:17:57.744 --> 01:18:00.411
We're going to need
a no-interest up-front loan,

01:18:00.413 --> 01:18:02.714
let's just call it
a grant, shall we,

01:18:02.716 --> 01:18:05.553
to make sure the debut album's
costs are completely covered.

01:18:33.747 --> 01:18:35.517
You
take out all that trash.

01:18:38.985 --> 01:18:40.452
Shut up, bitch.

01:18:40.454 --> 01:18:41.422
What was that?

01:18:42.556 --> 01:18:44.255
I mean, yeah, I heard you.
Whatever you want, Daddy.

01:18:44.257 --> 01:18:44.892
Whatever you want.

01:18:46.994 --> 01:18:48.827
Stop right there
and give us your wallet.

01:18:48.829 --> 01:18:50.295
Hey, I don't want
any trouble, guys.

01:18:50.297 --> 01:18:51.366
I...

01:18:52.565 --> 01:18:54.635
My God, are you guys ninjas?

01:18:56.904 --> 01:18:59.770
- Goddamn right we're ninjas.
- Ninjas with attitude.

01:18:59.772 --> 01:19:01.706
No, wait, wait, wait.
You back off.

01:19:01.708 --> 01:19:03.341
You back off
or I'll call the police.

01:19:03.343 --> 01:19:04.977
- Fuck the police!
- Yeah!

01:19:04.979 --> 01:19:06.647
No, no, sorry.

01:19:14.421 --> 01:19:16.287
You guys just took out
two ninjas.

01:19:16.289 --> 01:19:18.357
You guys must have huge balls!

01:19:18.359 --> 01:19:19.724

Now that we've erased
the ninja menace from this city,

01:19:28.936 --> 01:19:32.004
it is time for us to continue
our crusade elsssewhere.

01:19:32.006 --> 01:19:33.575
Wait, wait, wait.

01:19:34.909 --> 01:19:37.679
It's not every day that I get
to meet two mutant superheroes.

01:19:38.745 --> 01:19:40.248
Where are you gonna go?

01:19:42.283 --> 01:19:43.584
Wait, yeah,
