WEBVTT

00:20.145 --> 00:21.604
[electronic dance music
playing on earphones]

00:24.733 --> 00:26.192
Oh, I didn't hear you come in.

00:27.152 --> 00:31.031
[Ravi] I gotta say, I expected more.

00:31.114 --> 00:34.159
[Liv] What? It's a tech office.
They do that driving app?

00:34.242 --> 00:35.076
Pathseeker?

00:35.160 --> 00:37.328
And Shopulent. But it's more than that.

00:37.412 --> 00:39.289
Piercey was a genius.

00:39.372 --> 00:42.792
A big thinker, futurist, fascinating guy.

00:42.876 --> 00:45.962
I just expected more
from his headquarters, frankly.

00:46.045 --> 00:48.590
A dome, at least. Or holograms.

00:50.300 --> 00:53.052
-So, you found the body, Miss Shaw?
-[Miss Shaw] This morning,

00:53.136 --> 00:55.847
when I brought down his briefing file.

00:56.848 --> 01:01.644
And you say you were Mr. Piercey's
"Principal Life Enabler"?

01:01.728 --> 01:05.899
-I'm unsure what that--
-We reject traditional job titles here.

01:05.982 --> 01:07.650
It's a tech thing.

01:07.734 --> 01:09.444
But in traditional terms, you'd be...

01:09.527 --> 01:10.820
Personal assistant.

01:12.072 --> 01:14.240
And please, call me Nora.

01:18.411 --> 01:19.496
[scanner beeps]

01:21.456 --> 01:22.874
This place has a second story?

01:23.333 --> 01:24.167
No.

01:24.250 --> 01:25.835
[elevator whirring]

01:26.503 --> 01:29.464
You see, the financial success
of Pathseeker and Shopulent

01:29.547 --> 01:33.426
freed Cornell to focus on the challenges
he felt most pressing to humanity.

01:34.093 --> 01:38.932
Recently Cornell's time and mental energy
was largely taken up by Project Z.

01:39.015 --> 01:40.350
Project Z?

01:40.433 --> 01:42.227
For Ziusudra,

01:42.310 --> 01:45.313
builder of the ark in the Sumerian
precursor to the biblical flood myth.

01:47.565 --> 01:49.400
But mostly we just call it "the bunker."

01:55.073 --> 01:59.953
Cornell calculated that some sort
of apocalypse event was near imminent,

02:00.036 --> 02:02.288
so the goal was
to provide a secure habitat

02:02.372 --> 02:05.083
for a re-population-capable group
for 20 years.

02:05.166 --> 02:06.751
[Liv] This more what you expected?

02:06.835 --> 02:08.419
[Ravi] This is more what I expected.

02:08.503 --> 02:09.546
[chuckles]

02:09.629 --> 02:12.966
And this was what I was expecting.

02:13.842 --> 02:16.886
This isn't what I was expecting.
What's this?

02:16.970 --> 02:21.516
Oh. This was his list
of who he intended to invite inside.

02:21.599 --> 02:23.309
Peyton Charles? Why is she on it?

02:23.393 --> 02:27.397
I don't know, but I'm sure
Mr. Piercey had his reasons.

02:35.822 --> 02:37.949
Just so you know, I have an alibi.

02:39.242 --> 02:41.244
[opening theme music playing]

03:04.267 --> 03:05.268
[Ravi] I'm not mad.

03:05.351 --> 03:10.148
In an apocalypse, it'd give me solace
knowing you're safe in Cornell's bunker,

03:10.231 --> 03:12.108
while I battle motorcycle cannibals.

03:12.191 --> 03:14.903
I've never even met the guy. Okay?

03:14.986 --> 03:16.321
[man clears throat]

03:17.155 --> 03:19.991
Uh, hi. Sorry. I'm so sorry I'm late.
You ready?

03:20.074 --> 03:21.326
Yeah, apology accepted.
We're definitely ready.

03:21.409 --> 03:24.454
We have some scenes for you,
still a work-in-progress, obviously,

03:24.537 --> 03:25.413
so please be kind.

03:25.496 --> 03:26.831
But, the premise.

03:26.915 --> 03:30.293
A zombie couple struggles to deal
with their new human neighbors.

03:30.877 --> 03:33.922
Without any further ado,
we'd like to present to you, <i>Hi, Zombie.</i>

03:34.005 --> 03:36.507
Wait, wait, wait.
I'll just set the scene for you here.

03:36.591 --> 03:38.051
Okay. So, interior kitchen--

03:38.134 --> 03:39.219
You can just start.

03:40.345 --> 03:41.554
Okay, so...

03:42.764 --> 03:43.765
Go.

03:45.642 --> 03:48.811
Thanks for inviting us over,
and for loaning Jeff the pliers.

03:49.145 --> 03:52.607
Of course, we wanted to have you guys
for dinner since you moved in.

03:52.690 --> 03:55.109
-[gasps] See, Molly? They're gonna eat us.
-[gasps]

03:55.193 --> 03:57.070
-[Ravi chuckles]
-And then, enter Ed. I'm Ed.

03:57.153 --> 04:00.782
Hey, guys. Hey, Jeff, did you see
the end of the game?

04:00.865 --> 04:02.951
Yeah. We lost in overtime.

04:03.034 --> 04:04.786
Lost in overtime!

04:04.869 --> 04:08.164
Okay, so, at this point Ed's eyes go
fully red, and he smashes the microwave.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.207
[growling]

04:09.290 --> 04:11.542
Microwave, smash.

04:11.626 --> 04:12.627
[grunting]

04:12.710 --> 04:13.711
Yeah, I'm gonna stop you right here.

04:13.795 --> 04:14.629
Why?

04:15.171 --> 04:17.757
So, what we want
is a show that illustrates

04:17.840 --> 04:21.344
how despite all the misunderstanding,
humans and zombies have

04:21.427 --> 04:22.512
more in common than we think.

04:22.595 --> 04:24.722
Yeah, all right. So?

04:25.098 --> 04:26.849
So, what we don't wanna do
is portray zombies

04:26.933 --> 04:29.686
as indestructible, raging monsters
who eat people.

04:30.395 --> 04:32.855
Maybe lose the microwave and that stuff.

04:32.939 --> 04:36.025
In comedy, you have to challenge yourself
and the audience's perception.

04:36.109 --> 04:38.528
Good. But just see
what you can do with it.

04:38.611 --> 04:40.405
-I gotta run, actually.
-[Jimmy] No, no, no.

04:40.488 --> 04:44.951
-Let me explain, see, in comedy you have--
-[stammers] I think I get the note.

04:45.034 --> 04:49.080
How about I talk to Jimmy
and you go ahead?

04:50.039 --> 04:52.166
Okay. Good first effort.

04:53.084 --> 04:54.210
I gotta run.

05:02.927 --> 05:04.721
So, how did Jimmy take the notes?

05:05.179 --> 05:07.682
[sighs] Got a bit testy,
but I talked to him after, you know...

05:07.765 --> 05:10.059
[exhales sharply]
Comedy person to comedy person.

05:12.228 --> 05:13.354
We have cause of death yet?

05:13.438 --> 05:15.982
Ingestion of muscarine, an organic toxin

05:16.065 --> 05:18.276
found in deadly fiber cap
and ivory funnel mushrooms.

05:18.901 --> 05:20.820
Delivered by some kind of pills he took.

05:20.903 --> 05:23.906
Well, that explains
the pill case found at the scene.

05:23.990 --> 05:27.660
With very little else besides a few
hair fibers and a dried-up contact lens.

05:27.744 --> 05:28.745
Blue-tinted.

05:31.914 --> 05:33.124
Kind of blue already.

05:33.958 --> 05:35.043
Rich people.

05:35.668 --> 05:38.921
Come on, brain up, we're due
to see the new Piercey Corp CEO.

05:39.630 --> 05:41.424
Right. I will take it on the go.

05:43.718 --> 05:47.597
You know, for a genius's brain,
I thought it'd have a bit more pizzazz.

06:00.860 --> 06:02.070
[Liv] Mmm.

06:03.780 --> 06:06.282
Oh, come on. How many brains
have you seen me eat?

06:06.657 --> 06:08.993
It's just that kombucha stuff. Ugh.

06:11.162 --> 06:12.789
<i>So, how's the brain?</i>

06:13.081 --> 06:14.457
[Liv] Nothing specific so far.

06:14.540 --> 06:16.959
You'll let me know if you get
an urge to disrupt anything or--

06:17.043 --> 06:18.628
Which begs the question.

06:19.796 --> 06:22.173
Can the mind truly comprehend itself?

06:22.799 --> 06:24.801
Oh, man. So, it's gonna be like this?

06:24.884 --> 06:28.346
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Melissa Schultz, acting CEO.

06:28.429 --> 06:32.517
As you can imagine,
things have been a bit chaotic here.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.519
So, to make
the most efficient use of our time,

06:34.894 --> 06:38.147
I've compiled all relevant information
about Mr. Piercey and the company here.

06:38.231 --> 06:41.359
And in case I am a suspect, alibi details,

06:41.442 --> 06:43.694
outlines of
my business history with Cornell

06:43.778 --> 06:45.738
and details of our romantic relationship.

06:50.326 --> 06:52.245
You two were in a relationship?

06:52.328 --> 06:54.622
[sighs] Since we founded the company.

06:54.705 --> 06:56.457
We separated last year.

06:56.541 --> 06:57.458
It's in there.

06:57.542 --> 06:58.459
Hmm.

06:58.543 --> 06:59.877
And who broke up with whom?

06:59.961 --> 07:03.047
A mutual decision. I was infected
in the great Aleutian Flu scare.

07:03.131 --> 07:04.257
You're a zombie?

07:04.841 --> 07:05.758
Yes.

07:06.342 --> 07:08.052
But we remained close friends.

07:08.136 --> 07:10.012
And as you can see,

07:10.096 --> 07:12.432
profits from our work together
were split equitably,

07:12.515 --> 07:14.892
and I bear him no grudges personally,

07:14.976 --> 07:18.187
so I don't see what motive
I could have to murder him.

07:19.439 --> 07:22.275
Do you have any additional questions?

07:22.650 --> 07:25.695
-Were you at all involved in his--
-Ideas.

07:27.196 --> 07:28.990
Liv, uh, what?

07:29.073 --> 07:31.659
Are ideas intangible things? No.

07:32.118 --> 07:34.745
They exist in the world. They have value.

07:34.829 --> 07:36.164
Liv, does this relate to--

07:36.247 --> 07:39.125
You might say that you and Cornell
had equitable dealings,

07:39.208 --> 07:43.045
but it was Cornell who was credited
for your shared ideas.

07:43.129 --> 07:45.506
Is that not a suitable motive for murder?

07:45.590 --> 07:46.883
Oh... [short chuckle]

07:46.966 --> 07:51.012
No. I loathe attention and publicity.
I wanted it that way.

07:51.512 --> 07:53.222
I see.

07:53.306 --> 07:54.348
Continue.

07:57.310 --> 08:00.771
Melissa, were you at all involved
in Cornell's bunker project?

08:00.855 --> 08:02.440
My day-to-day was current business.

08:02.815 --> 08:06.527
I was aware but uninvolved since,
as a zombie, I was not on his list.

08:06.611 --> 08:12.825
Uh... One thing I don't see here is,
was he on any medications or vitamins?

08:12.909 --> 08:15.453
Cornell was on a daily regimen
of nootropic supplements,

08:15.536 --> 08:16.787
and he took a microdose

08:16.871 --> 08:18.706
of hallucinogenic mushrooms
for mental clarity.

08:20.333 --> 08:21.709
And this was common knowledge?

08:21.792 --> 08:22.752
Yes.

08:24.378 --> 08:25.463
[sighs] So...

08:26.422 --> 08:27.757
Is there anything else?

08:28.090 --> 08:29.383
[inhales]

08:29.926 --> 08:30.760
No.

08:30.843 --> 08:34.430
So, as Cornell's neurochem consultant,
I dropped off a customized regimen

08:34.514 --> 08:38.100
with his life enabler, Nora,
every Monday morning and that's it.

08:38.184 --> 08:39.936
And I'm sure you'll agree,

08:40.019 --> 08:42.271
poisoning my best client
would be nonsensical.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.440
I'd be more likely to take
your word for it, Dalton,

08:44.524 --> 08:46.567
if your file were a bit lighter.

08:46.651 --> 08:49.946
A series of misunderstandings
in a past life. Charges dropped and--

08:50.029 --> 08:52.782
And now you're in nootropics?

08:53.324 --> 08:56.452
"Smart drugs," if you will.
Cutting-edge pharmacology

08:56.536 --> 08:59.956
for brain enhancement,
increased energy and executive function.

09:00.039 --> 09:04.085
The bio-engineered mind,
the next step in human evolution.

09:04.168 --> 09:05.711
You know, I'm surprised
you guys don't do it.

09:05.795 --> 09:06.963
I bet you the criminals do.

09:07.046 --> 09:09.507
So, like, ginkgo biloba, taurine?

09:09.590 --> 09:14.011
Horse-and-buggy stuff. I'm all about
L-theanine, Alpha-GPC, vinpocetine,

09:14.095 --> 09:18.432
specialized stacks tailored for individual
clients and their unique brain chemistry.

09:18.516 --> 09:19.976
And he was mushroom microdosing?

09:20.059 --> 09:24.105
Highly effective. Mental clarity,
focus, conceptual openness.

09:24.188 --> 09:25.606
I can get you
some literature, if you'd like.

09:25.856 --> 09:27.817
Perhaps a starter pack.
Take it for a spin.

09:28.192 --> 09:30.820
Intriguing.
What's your trial data set like?

09:30.903 --> 09:34.407
A relevant question is,
with Piercey, any chance

09:34.490 --> 09:35.992
maybe you picked a bad mushroom?

09:36.075 --> 09:39.704
No. I grow my own spores
in highly controlled conditions.

09:39.787 --> 09:42.164
The feedback data's all in here.

09:43.499 --> 09:46.836
Were you aware
of something called Project Z?

09:46.919 --> 09:50.006
The bunker thing? Wild, huh?
Guy was a visionary.

09:50.089 --> 09:52.466
You know, he kept a list
of who he intended to let in.

09:52.550 --> 09:53.551
Was I on it?

09:54.010 --> 09:54.844
No.

09:54.927 --> 09:59.181
Ah. Well, guess we'll be <i>Mad Max-</i>ing it
out here together, then, huh?

09:59.932 --> 10:02.018
Wonderful. We'll be in touch.

10:06.814 --> 10:07.857
What?

10:07.940 --> 10:10.568
If criminals have them,
it only makes logical sense.

10:13.404 --> 10:16.824
So, you're firing me because I'm gay?

10:16.907 --> 10:18.743
Oh, God. No.

10:18.826 --> 10:19.785
My daughter's gay.

10:19.869 --> 10:23.581
But, um,
this in front of the brain dispensary,

10:23.664 --> 10:26.917
and, uh,
this in front of the tanning salon.

10:27.376 --> 10:29.420
Parents saw this and complained.

10:29.503 --> 10:30.796
And frankly, I can't blame them.

10:30.880 --> 10:34.925
Wanting their kids
to be taught by someone who's, well...

10:35.009 --> 10:35.968
Alive.

10:38.721 --> 10:40.348
[thunder rumbling]

10:46.395 --> 10:47.855
Smile, zombie.

10:54.612 --> 10:56.197
How about that?

10:56.280 --> 10:58.115
There's paparazzi outside.

10:58.199 --> 10:59.116
We've finally arrived.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.326
That's not paparazzi.

11:00.409 --> 11:02.495
It's those Dead Enders guys.
It's creepy, man.

11:02.578 --> 11:05.748
Fillmore-Graves says we should call them.
They'll come deal with it.

11:06.082 --> 11:07.541
And kill the vibe that I need,

11:07.625 --> 11:10.086
'cause my <i>Bluster</i> magazine profile
is due tonight?

11:10.753 --> 11:13.547
By the way, have you been keeping
an eye out for this Al?

11:13.631 --> 11:16.300
Al Bronson. No. What's he look like?

11:16.384 --> 11:17.927
I don't know. What do writers look like?

11:18.010 --> 11:20.888
Styleless, underpaid, insecure?

11:22.264 --> 11:24.767
By the way, we need to cull
the riff-raff at the bar.

11:24.850 --> 11:27.436
You never get a second chance
to make a first impression.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.021
I mean, look at Bukowski here.

11:30.106 --> 11:31.023
Hey!

11:31.107 --> 11:33.025
You heard the man, out you go.

11:34.193 --> 11:35.319
You, too, big boy.

11:35.778 --> 11:37.488
Nothing personal, just aesthetics.

11:37.571 --> 11:38.656
Cheers.

11:42.368 --> 11:46.122
But you, you can stay.

11:46.789 --> 11:49.083
I don't believe we've met. I'm Blaine.

11:49.166 --> 11:50.251
Welcome to my place.

11:50.334 --> 11:51.752
It's nice to meet you, Blaine.

11:51.836 --> 11:53.629
Al Bronson, <i>Bluster</i> magazine.

11:55.339 --> 11:56.215
Ah.

11:57.383 --> 12:00.386
You are not
what I was expecting in an "Al."

12:00.469 --> 12:01.637
Short for Alice.

12:02.304 --> 12:04.598
Don't let the looks
of youth and glow fool you.

12:04.682 --> 12:07.101
I've profiled everyone in the area.
I've done Gates.

12:07.184 --> 12:10.729
Ty Griss, beloved CEO of You-Freight-EZ.
Chris Pratt before the wall went up.

12:10.813 --> 12:14.358
And I was doing Floyd Baracus,
world's first zombie mayor,

12:14.442 --> 12:17.445
-before he bit the big one.
-Yeah.

12:17.736 --> 12:20.531
Well, then, I look forward to you--

12:20.614 --> 12:23.242
You doing me? Yeah. I've heard it.

12:23.325 --> 12:24.326
Shall we proceed?

12:27.204 --> 12:28.998
[TV playing]

12:31.375 --> 12:33.836
-[indistinct TV chatter]
-[both laughing]

12:34.879 --> 12:35.880
Major?

12:39.049 --> 12:42.470
Hey. I was just checking
on Jalen and Michael,

12:42.553 --> 12:45.389
but did you hear their favorite teacher
got outed as a zombie and fired?

12:45.473 --> 12:47.224
-[Liv] Mr. Moss?
-[Curtis] It's the Dead Enders.

12:47.308 --> 12:48.726
They've got this website where they post

12:48.809 --> 12:53.314
photos they take outside zombie clubs,
brain dispensaries, tanning salons.

12:53.772 --> 12:56.275
I'm going to visit their principal
tomorrow, get the school fixed.

12:56.358 --> 12:57.693
And what is school?

12:58.319 --> 13:01.822
Merely an indoctrination
into a system of acceptable thoughts.

13:02.114 --> 13:04.575
Mmm.
Liv, is this some kind of brain you're on?

13:04.658 --> 13:06.118
What are our decision points?

13:06.911 --> 13:10.206
Being bullied at school?
Favorite teacher fired?

13:10.289 --> 13:11.832
Security issues, going in and out?

13:12.791 --> 13:15.252
Occam's razor suggests
the simplest answer.

13:16.086 --> 13:17.838
Hire Mr. Moss to tutor them here.

13:17.922 --> 13:19.173
[all] Yes.

13:20.966 --> 13:24.178
And yes, I am on a bit of a brain.

13:25.804 --> 13:27.806
[Blaine] Well, you know how it goes.

13:27.890 --> 13:32.603
Rich, disapproving father,
willful son, yadda yadda.

13:32.686 --> 13:33.812
I had some lost years.

13:33.896 --> 13:35.773
Theft? Drug dealing?

13:35.856 --> 13:38.526
You did your homework. You are a pro.

13:38.901 --> 13:41.570
You know, you should really see my place.

13:43.113 --> 13:45.157
The night's still young...

13:45.491 --> 13:48.953
"Within an hour of meeting DeBeers,
he propositioned me twice."

13:49.453 --> 13:51.664
Hey, I meant for the piece.

13:52.706 --> 13:56.669
We wouldn't be alone. It's like
a non-stop happening soiree over there.

13:57.419 --> 13:59.338
And plus, what would happen between us?

14:00.089 --> 14:02.758
He's a zombie, she's human.

14:02.841 --> 14:04.301
We all know that old story.

14:04.969 --> 14:06.804
Would a human woman have these nails?

14:10.349 --> 14:13.561
Well, I should get this all down.

14:13.644 --> 14:15.521
So, to be continued, Mr. DeBeers.

14:17.523 --> 14:20.401
I look forward to it, Al.

14:24.738 --> 14:25.823
[Buddy] <i>Wake up, man.</i>

14:25.906 --> 14:27.700
-Wake up.
-[groaning]

14:28.534 --> 14:29.618
Come on, dude.

14:29.910 --> 14:31.537
[continues groaning]

14:33.831 --> 14:35.958
[panting]

14:38.377 --> 14:39.295
What's going on?

14:39.378 --> 14:41.964
-Are we free?
-I don't know.

14:42.047 --> 14:43.173
I don't think so.

14:43.257 --> 14:44.925
[metal clanging]

14:48.387 --> 14:52.182
Gentlemen, thawing nicely?<i> Bien.</i>

14:52.266 --> 14:54.143
He doesn't look 30 years older.

14:54.226 --> 14:56.729
You've been frozen three weeks.

14:56.812 --> 14:59.982
So, do we get pardoned or what?

15:00.065 --> 15:04.320
You got chosen to start new lives,

15:04.403 --> 15:06.739
casting off your old ones,

15:06.822 --> 15:08.908
pledging yourselves to a new cause.

15:09.450 --> 15:12.661
Should you accept,
you'll be working in the shadows.

15:13.454 --> 15:16.332
But you will be helping to save
zombiekind from extinction,

15:16.498 --> 15:19.418
with the freedom to use
all necessary force.

15:20.711 --> 15:24.006
Or you can go back in the freezer.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.677
So, would you like to meet the new boss?

15:30.137 --> 15:31.764
'Cause he wants to meet you.

15:43.984 --> 15:46.028
He is there.

16:02.836 --> 16:04.421
[man] Go ahead and grab a seat.

16:17.726 --> 16:19.812
[snorting]

16:22.523 --> 16:26.068
[exhales deeply, rolls tongue]

16:26.151 --> 16:27.277
[clicks tongue]

16:30.280 --> 16:34.702
Now, I hear that you guys killed
some humans at Warmbloods.

16:35.411 --> 16:36.495
That right?

16:37.454 --> 16:38.497
That's right.

16:41.709 --> 16:43.002
Good.

16:44.628 --> 16:45.796
I need killers.

16:46.505 --> 16:47.589
Who are you?

16:48.674 --> 16:49.967
A better question is...

16:52.219 --> 16:55.347
You know, what am I? What are we?

16:56.056 --> 16:57.266
You and me?

16:59.018 --> 17:00.352
We're what's next.

17:02.146 --> 17:03.188
The next step.

17:03.647 --> 17:04.690
Next step of what?

17:07.026 --> 17:08.110
Human evolution.

17:09.945 --> 17:10.988
Neanderthals.

17:12.531 --> 17:13.782
The Capayanes,

17:14.324 --> 17:16.994
Koningo, Timucua, Pequot.

17:17.745 --> 17:19.496
Gentlemen, what do they
all have in common?

17:20.080 --> 17:21.081
Extinct species.

17:21.915 --> 17:22.958
Tribes.

17:24.126 --> 17:26.462
Branches fallen off the tree of humanity.

17:27.713 --> 17:31.258
You see, someone stronger comes along
and this one can't compete.

17:32.676 --> 17:35.888
Pretty soon, it's just... Poof!

17:37.723 --> 17:38.849
Gone.

17:40.184 --> 17:42.811
Now, humans. Homo sapiens.

17:43.645 --> 17:45.105
They've had a pretty good run.

17:46.273 --> 17:47.816
But zombies are here now.

17:48.567 --> 17:50.486
The science is clear.

17:50.569 --> 17:52.071
[chuckles]

17:52.362 --> 17:53.822
It's either us or them.

17:56.158 --> 17:57.868
Who do you want it to be?

17:57.951 --> 17:58.827
Us.

17:59.495 --> 18:00.621
Spoken like a winner.

18:07.503 --> 18:10.380
[sighs] Hey, man, I don't know you.

18:11.673 --> 18:13.008
Good luck and all, but...

18:15.177 --> 18:16.178
Pass.

18:17.596 --> 18:18.931
-[gasps, grunts]
-[blow lands]

18:22.267 --> 18:24.103
[breathes heavily]

18:24.686 --> 18:25.771
[sighs]

18:38.033 --> 18:39.159
Welcome aboard.

18:39.952 --> 18:42.996
I don't get your objection
to nootropics, Ravi.

18:43.080 --> 18:44.498
They've been shown to work.

18:44.581 --> 18:48.627
Well, on nerds desperate to be smart.
Textbook placebo effect.

18:49.461 --> 18:51.213
My mental capacity is clearly enhanced.

18:52.798 --> 18:55.384
Go on, give me an equation or a riddle.

18:55.467 --> 18:56.468
No.

18:56.552 --> 18:59.513
Anyway, messing with the mind,
it feels like kind of Frankenstein-y.

18:59.596 --> 19:00.973
Horses disrupted feet.

19:01.056 --> 19:02.558
Trains disrupted the horse.

19:02.641 --> 19:04.935
Smart drugs will disrupt the mind itself.

19:05.602 --> 19:07.938
Imagine, Ravi, "the new normal."

19:09.898 --> 19:13.819
Synthetically enhanced brains processing
a massively expanded sensorium,

19:13.902 --> 19:17.781
wired into a worldwide data net with
cybernetically empowered super bodies.

19:17.865 --> 19:20.701
Got it. The future will be obnoxious.

19:20.784 --> 19:23.162
Now, can we please turn to Mrs. Elkhorn?

19:23.245 --> 19:26.456
-Attached to your meat space? I get it.
-[sighs]

19:26.540 --> 19:29.084
Not everyone can think beyond the...

19:31.879 --> 19:33.672
[electronic dance music playing]

19:38.635 --> 19:40.012
[Miss Shaw] Cornell.

19:40.095 --> 19:41.722
[Cornell] Oh, I didn't hear you come in.

19:43.599 --> 19:44.975
[gasps]

19:46.101 --> 19:47.144
The assistant saw.

19:47.227 --> 19:49.813
She saw him replace her name
with Peyton's.

19:50.272 --> 19:51.398
Uh, where you going?

19:51.523 --> 19:53.233
To find Clive, get to Piercey Corp.

19:53.942 --> 19:56.945
Logic dictates, if you withhold data,
you have reason to hide it.

19:57.029 --> 19:59.031
Data? What? You mean a statement?

19:59.114 --> 20:03.452
It's all data, Ravi.
I mean, you could design a system.

20:03.535 --> 20:05.537
You'd have a mechanism
to gather crime data.

20:05.621 --> 20:08.874
Physical evidence, testimony,
relationships, motive.

20:08.957 --> 20:11.877
A smart algorithm analyzes and <i>voilà.</i>

20:11.960 --> 20:17.090
Congratulations.
You just invented the police.

20:17.174 --> 20:19.509
It's just... I told you everything.

20:19.593 --> 20:21.595
Except that your name
was on that bunker list

20:21.678 --> 20:24.223
until Cornell replaced it
with Peyton Charles.

20:24.306 --> 20:26.391
What? How do you even...

20:26.475 --> 20:30.812
Forensics can, um, dust a whiteboard now.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.023
Okay.

20:34.399 --> 20:36.818
Besides working closely together,

20:38.820 --> 20:41.531
Cornell and I were also...

20:41.615 --> 20:43.242
[whispers] Lovers.

20:44.159 --> 20:46.453
He decided, with my IQ,

20:46.536 --> 20:50.999
Yale degree, fertility index
and attraction profile,

20:51.083 --> 20:52.918
I deserved to be on that list.

20:53.001 --> 20:55.587
-Then he chose--
-To replace you with Ms. Charles?

20:56.546 --> 20:59.258
I don't see the connection.

20:59.341 --> 21:01.218
There barely is one.

21:01.301 --> 21:05.555
He saw her give a speech at a fundraiser
and was impressed.

21:06.348 --> 21:10.519
Law degree, hands-on
governing experience, fit the--

21:10.602 --> 21:12.020
Attraction profile?

21:12.521 --> 21:13.480
[sighs]

21:13.563 --> 21:15.941
Were you upset at being replaced?

21:16.024 --> 21:21.071
Cornell made all his decisions
in dispassionate and logical terms.

21:21.154 --> 21:26.326
And I know the sacrifices he had to make
to make his vision a reality.

21:26.451 --> 21:27.995
Sacrifices, like what?

21:28.078 --> 21:29.579
Like money.

21:30.664 --> 21:34.376
His project was a severe drain
on the company's finances.

21:36.211 --> 21:37.879
He was nearly broke.

21:38.463 --> 21:41.842
Frankly, I'm not entirely sure how
he kept the whole project afloat.

21:44.720 --> 21:47.222
I will sink you! Do you hear me?

21:47.306 --> 21:50.058
I paid you for delivery.
Now where the hell's my product?

21:50.684 --> 21:51.601
[gasps]

21:52.686 --> 21:53.603
Is she okay?

21:53.687 --> 21:55.647
Thanks for your time.

21:57.733 --> 21:59.901
-[scoffs]
-What'd you see?

21:59.985 --> 22:03.280
A man yelling about something
he paid for that Cornell didn't deliver.

22:03.363 --> 22:04.573
What man?

22:04.656 --> 22:05.907
I don't know.

22:05.991 --> 22:07.284
[Al] <i>I'm curious,</i>

22:07.367 --> 22:08.952
given your colorful background,

22:09.036 --> 22:11.538
why the city would come to you
with their brain problem.

22:11.621 --> 22:14.291
Well, I'd chalk that up
to the Blaine DeBeers brand.

22:14.374 --> 22:15.834
Your brand.

22:15.917 --> 22:18.795
I'm a maverick, a rogue.

22:18.879 --> 22:22.215
Bit of an outlaw, who knows that you can't
always draw inside the lines,

22:22.299 --> 22:25.177
but always ends up doing
the right thing in the end.

22:26.636 --> 22:28.805
Hey, Don E.

22:28.889 --> 22:31.058
We opened it an hour ago.

22:31.141 --> 22:33.018
It's like tumbleweeds in here.

22:33.101 --> 22:34.144
Dead Enders are back.

22:34.227 --> 22:36.271
They're taking pictures.
They're spooking clientele.

22:36.354 --> 22:38.315
I was gonna get Carl,
we were gonna go out back--

22:38.398 --> 22:39.858
Okay, okay. Relax.

22:40.025 --> 22:42.652
Relax? Blaine, no customers means
no money, which means--

22:42.736 --> 22:47.365
Don E, I went to the Wharton Business
School for a semester and a half.

22:48.909 --> 22:53.163
Go back to the kitchen, ask the chef
for number six on the brain menu.

22:53.246 --> 22:55.415
Number six. Got it. Coming right up.

22:55.624 --> 22:56.625
[Blaine] Oh!

22:56.708 --> 22:58.627
And go talk to the Brazilians
across the street,

22:58.710 --> 23:00.879
see if Paulo and the boys are free.

23:10.639 --> 23:13.016
[Liv] Sorry about the cloak and dagger,
Mr. Moss.

23:13.517 --> 23:14.851
Renegade.

23:15.519 --> 23:16.520
Wow.

23:16.603 --> 23:18.939
So, what we wanted to see you about--

23:19.022 --> 23:20.857
Oh, the Fillmore-Graves guy.

23:20.941 --> 23:23.401
Yes. Is a job.

23:23.485 --> 23:26.488
We have five zombie kids here
who need tutoring.

23:26.571 --> 23:29.866
Ideally, an open curriculum,
conducive to independent thinking

23:29.950 --> 23:31.451
and creative problem solving.

23:31.535 --> 23:33.078
You mean me?

23:35.705 --> 23:37.082
[exhales] Yes, I'm in.

23:37.165 --> 23:40.836
Before you commit,
know it's not just about teaching.

23:40.919 --> 23:43.296
This is the hub of Renegade's operation.

23:43.380 --> 23:45.632
Secrecy is key.

23:45.715 --> 23:48.093
You'd have to follow
very strict security protocols.

23:48.176 --> 23:51.304
Of course. I understand.

23:51.388 --> 23:52.639
Good.

23:52.722 --> 23:54.266
Lives depend on it.

24:00.814 --> 24:02.190
[camera shutter clicking]

24:05.485 --> 24:07.320
How about you stick
that camera up your ass, man?

24:07.445 --> 24:08.655
Take a selfie!

24:10.740 --> 24:12.534
You wanna go, zombie, huh?

24:13.535 --> 24:15.370
-[door opens]
-Let's go! Come on!

24:18.582 --> 24:21.418
Another key element of the Blaine brand
I'd like you to see.

24:21.501 --> 24:22.377
Ah, here they come.

24:22.460 --> 24:23.753
Hey, Paulo!

24:26.089 --> 24:27.215
[Blaine] It's hard to put a name on it.

24:27.299 --> 24:31.219
Some might call it style,
others might call it flair.

24:31.303 --> 24:34.014
Just a certain way of doing things.

24:34.347 --> 24:37.058
Paulo, a brisk Samba, if you will.

24:37.142 --> 24:38.935
[playing samba rhythm]

24:44.107 --> 24:45.692
Hey.

24:46.026 --> 24:47.402
I'd like to ask you to leave.

24:47.485 --> 24:49.196
Why don't you make me, zombie?

24:49.279 --> 24:50.655
-[laughs]
-[door opens]

24:50.739 --> 24:51.656
Well...

24:54.034 --> 24:54.951
Since you asked.

24:56.870 --> 24:58.413
[both grunting]

25:07.214 --> 25:11.176
Number six, capoeira brain.
Brazilian art of dance fighting.

25:19.017 --> 25:20.685
[exhales, sniffs]

25:21.978 --> 25:23.188
It's a bit flamboyant, I guess.

25:24.064 --> 25:26.691
-Wall or no wall, this is still America.
-[car engine starting]

25:27.651 --> 25:30.237
Putting on a good show never hurts.

25:30.320 --> 25:33.907
Sorry for the disturbance, folks.
First drink's on the house.

25:37.118 --> 25:41.289
I, uh, think I might get the appeal
of the Blaine brand.

25:41.373 --> 25:45.126
And... I might want to see the rest.

25:45.210 --> 25:48.505
This pad of yours,
with the non-stop soiree you mentioned?

25:48.838 --> 25:51.049
Shall we say, tomorrow?

25:51.132 --> 25:52.175
Nine-ish?

25:52.259 --> 25:53.343
[chuckles]

25:55.303 --> 25:58.431
Don E, hit up my Rolodex.
I need a solid quality soiree

25:58.515 --> 26:00.308
up and running by 6:00 p.m.
tomorrow, all right?

26:04.104 --> 26:05.313
[chuckles]

26:12.988 --> 26:14.489
Okay, are we ready or what?

26:14.572 --> 26:15.657
[Jimmy] Yeah, just a second.

26:15.740 --> 26:17.951
Sorry, I just needed Jimmy
for a quick police sketch.

26:18.034 --> 26:20.996
It's just, his expression was more
like he demanded respect

26:21.079 --> 26:22.372
for an imagined authority.

26:22.455 --> 26:24.874
Liv, I can't draw that, okay?
Here, just take it.

26:24.958 --> 26:27.252
-Let me focus on this.
-Sorry. Okay.

26:27.335 --> 26:29.754
Okay. On with the show.

26:29.838 --> 26:32.382
Okay. So, take two.

26:32.465 --> 26:35.635
Beth answers the door to Jeff and Molly.

26:38.471 --> 26:40.307
Hey, thanks for coming over.

26:40.390 --> 26:42.142
How' s the new place working out?

26:42.225 --> 26:45.312
Great. I can't imagine
why the previous couple left.

26:45.395 --> 26:47.439
-Oh, we ate them.
-[both gasp]

26:47.522 --> 26:50.442
Kidding. We're not those kind of zombies.

26:50.525 --> 26:52.319
-[Jimmy] And enter Ed. I'm Ed.
-[inhales]

26:52.402 --> 26:54.195
[sighs] Sorry I'm late, guys.

26:54.279 --> 26:57.782
A car parked on my foot in the
shopping mall parking lot and... [sighs]

26:57.866 --> 27:02.037
-Darn it, I forgot the bread.
-You forgot the bread?

27:02.203 --> 27:03.413
[roars]

27:03.496 --> 27:04.831
For God's sake, just stop.

27:04.914 --> 27:06.166
What?

27:06.249 --> 27:07.625
We got rid of the microwave.

27:07.709 --> 27:09.919
It's the same stuff.
You just switched it around.

27:10.003 --> 27:11.546
It's a comedy, okay?

27:11.629 --> 27:13.882
That means you have to have comedy in it.

27:13.965 --> 27:18.428
If you just want an uplifting message,
print a pamphlet that says, "Be nice."

27:18.511 --> 27:22.098
I want a show. Funny characters
the audience can relate to and--

27:22.182 --> 27:25.852
"Funny"! See what you said, funny.
That means comedy. [stammers]

27:25.935 --> 27:28.313
Liv, am I crazy?

27:28.396 --> 27:31.232
Or I was wondering,
if we had all the same jokes,

27:31.316 --> 27:33.485
but it was the humans making them.

27:33.568 --> 27:35.820
Like funny, wrong assumptions.

27:35.904 --> 27:40.241
Exactly. Still funny,
but about human ignorance.

27:40.325 --> 27:44.829
If you know what you want so bad,
why don't you just write it?

27:44.913 --> 27:46.206
Well...

27:47.999 --> 27:49.334
That was rhetorical.

27:49.417 --> 27:52.253
Actually, Yasmine.
You're our head writer now.

27:53.296 --> 27:54.923
Let's just start with your idea,
and go from there.

27:55.006 --> 27:58.802
What? Okay, okay, that's it.
I'm out of here! Let's go, guys.

27:59.344 --> 28:00.387
[Ravi] Oh!

28:04.307 --> 28:05.350
[door opens]

28:05.433 --> 28:08.686
Okay, then. Yasmine, get to work.

28:08.770 --> 28:09.979
[door closes]

28:11.398 --> 28:14.526
I don't recognize the man,
but if Cornell met with him,

28:14.609 --> 28:17.862
he should be on his computer,
if you don't mind going down to check.

28:18.655 --> 28:21.074
He kept very detailed contact records.

28:28.206 --> 28:30.291
I just had to make sure
I had the correct passwords.

28:30.375 --> 28:32.710
Are you sure he did business with the man?

28:32.794 --> 28:36.631
Yes. The language he used.
"Paid. Delivery. Product."

28:37.674 --> 28:40.218
Did he ever travel any place tropical
with beaches?

28:40.301 --> 28:42.929
-No. He disliked the sun.
-He disliked excessive sun.

28:44.639 --> 28:46.099
Or it was here.

28:47.892 --> 28:50.687
-He was in this elevator.
-Who was?

28:51.771 --> 28:54.023
-This man.
-The Fixture King.

28:56.025 --> 29:00.238
Sheldon the Fixture King. Fixture Castle?

29:00.321 --> 29:01.823
Those ads on late night?

29:03.032 --> 29:04.993
<i>Want fixtures fit for a king?</i>

29:05.076 --> 29:10.790
<i>Come see me, the Fixture King!</i>
<i>Let me turn your home into a castle!</i>

29:10.874 --> 29:12.625
[Sheldon laughs]

29:12.709 --> 29:14.252
[cackling]

29:15.920 --> 29:18.047
[Clive] Thank you
for coming in, Mr. Drake.

29:18.131 --> 29:21.468
Nice watch.
Guess the fixtures business is going well.

29:21.551 --> 29:24.304
Yeah. Volume. Does wonders.

29:25.555 --> 29:28.266
Listen, I got a tee time in an hour.
Can we make it quick?

29:28.349 --> 29:30.310
Yeah, of course.
We just have a few questions.

29:30.393 --> 29:31.686
-As soon as my colleague--
-[door opens]

29:32.729 --> 29:33.980
Oh.

29:34.063 --> 29:35.607
Sorry to keep you waiting.

29:35.690 --> 29:39.194
Okay, no. That's it.
I'm not talking to her.

29:39.277 --> 29:40.820
What's the problem?

29:40.904 --> 29:43.865
She is. I know Renegade.

29:43.948 --> 29:45.700
I only talk to the living.

29:46.743 --> 29:51.706
Okay, well, we're investigating
the death of Cornell Piercey.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.833
I believe you two had some
business before he died.

29:53.917 --> 29:55.710
[laughs] Oh!

29:55.794 --> 29:57.796
And why would you believe that?

29:57.879 --> 29:59.589
Well, just based on conversations--

29:59.672 --> 30:02.050
I saw it, in a vision.

30:02.133 --> 30:05.386
You ate the man's brain,
you saw his thoughts.

30:05.470 --> 30:06.930
That is vile.

30:07.013 --> 30:10.058
You were angry. You paid for something
and he didn't deliver.

30:10.141 --> 30:11.267
Could you tell us what it was?

30:11.351 --> 30:15.939
Yeah, sure. I hired him for a very
special project called "screw you."

30:16.689 --> 30:17.899
That cover everything?

30:18.817 --> 30:23.488
Now, unless you want to come back
with a warrant, I'm due at my club,

30:23.571 --> 30:26.658
where they wouldn't even let
your undead ass through the door.

30:26.741 --> 30:27.742
[Clive] Okay.

30:27.826 --> 30:28.993
Thanks for your time.

30:30.286 --> 30:31.371
[Sheldon] Oh.

30:32.080 --> 30:33.081
And, Renegade.

30:33.790 --> 30:35.375
I had a vision, too.

30:35.458 --> 30:39.045
All of you monsters were wiped off
the face of the earth,

30:39.128 --> 30:42.715
and I was dancing on your ashes.

30:42.799 --> 30:44.759
Your time's almost up, zombie.

30:51.182 --> 30:53.560
That guy really doesn't like zombies.

30:53.643 --> 30:54.936
[sighs]

31:00.400 --> 31:04.237
Liv. That zombie watch website
I was telling you about,

31:04.320 --> 31:05.864
check it out.

31:08.700 --> 31:10.076
It's a doxxing operation.

31:10.159 --> 31:14.205
They take pictures at brain lines,
tanning salons, places zombies go.

31:14.289 --> 31:18.459
Then they're connecting
the pictures to names, addresses...

31:18.543 --> 31:20.670
They already ID'd a few hundred.

31:20.753 --> 31:23.464
Eventually, they're gonna out
every zombie in the city.

31:23.548 --> 31:25.967
At a hundred a month? In ten years, maybe.

31:27.635 --> 31:29.220
Their methodology is painfully crude.

31:29.304 --> 31:34.475
I mean, all you need is the right data,
purchase habits, GPS tracking.

31:35.685 --> 31:38.062
-You could ID every zombie in Seattle in--
-[cell phone rings]

31:38.146 --> 31:40.148
Okay, their tech may be shoddy--

31:40.231 --> 31:41.608
-Clive.
-[Clive] <i>I got something.</i>

31:41.691 --> 31:44.319
You remember there was a contact lens
found at the scene?

31:44.402 --> 31:45.528
Dried up, blue-tinted?

31:45.612 --> 31:46.738
I also have something.

31:46.821 --> 31:50.325
What did all of Cornell Piercey's apps
rely on for their function?

31:50.408 --> 31:51.743
Uh... I... I don't--

31:51.826 --> 31:52.952
User data.

31:53.036 --> 31:55.872
Shopping and driving apps
both collected user data

31:55.955 --> 31:59.083
that could, with the right algorithm,
link behaviors to identities.

32:00.293 --> 32:01.377
Sheldon Drake's eyes are brown.

32:01.461 --> 32:04.297
I rewatched his Fixture King ad
and guess what color--

32:04.422 --> 32:06.925
Blue. The lens was Sheldon's.

32:07.592 --> 32:09.510
Cornell's company had loads of user data

32:09.594 --> 32:11.387
that could be used
to ID certain behaviors,

32:11.471 --> 32:12.805
where they drive, what they buy.

32:12.889 --> 32:15.683
<i>I know what Sheldon</i>
<i>was paying Cornell to do.</i>

32:15.767 --> 32:18.353
<i>-You see what I'm getting at?</i>
-I do.

32:18.436 --> 32:19.854
You think it's enough for a warrant?

32:19.938 --> 32:21.898
I do. Let's see if a judge agrees.

32:23.650 --> 32:25.485
[crowd chatting and laughing]

32:26.986 --> 32:28.696
[music playing]

32:28.780 --> 32:31.824
You actually came.
I'm pleasantly surprised.

32:31.908 --> 32:33.701
Welcome to <i>mi casa.</i>

32:37.538 --> 32:40.959
There's actually other people here.
I'm also pleasantly surprised.

32:41.042 --> 32:43.503
Well, if I'm anything,
I am a man of my word.

32:43.586 --> 32:45.046
Let me give you the tour.

32:49.133 --> 32:51.302
[dance-pop music playing]

32:55.014 --> 32:56.808
It's like the best possible outcome.

32:57.558 --> 33:00.269
Five students, all zombies.
Open teaching plans.

33:00.395 --> 33:02.146
-It's crazy you work for Renegade.
-Uh...

33:02.230 --> 33:03.106
Oh.

33:03.189 --> 33:04.732
Right. Hush, hush.

33:04.816 --> 33:05.650
I forgot.

33:05.733 --> 33:07.276
-You live such an intriguing life.
-[camera shutter clicks]

33:07.360 --> 33:10.154
Yes, the lifestyle
of a middle school teacher.

33:10.279 --> 33:12.031
Late nights grading papers.

33:12.532 --> 33:14.450
Lesson plans on McCarthyism.

33:15.076 --> 33:17.787
Leaving whoopee cushions
on my chair. Real sexy stuff.

33:18.538 --> 33:20.873
It's very nice. Early de Kooning?

33:21.708 --> 33:22.709
[Blaine] I don't know.

33:23.418 --> 33:24.419
I just like orange.

33:24.502 --> 33:26.379
[cell phone vibrating]

33:27.338 --> 33:29.966
Sorry, I have to take this.
Go ahead and meander.

33:31.050 --> 33:33.594
Put it in the story. Likes orange.

33:35.096 --> 33:36.347
This better be important.

33:39.976 --> 33:42.603
Yeah. Blaine's a super guy.
He and I go way back.

33:44.397 --> 33:47.066
I would love to know more about him
and the years before the wall, when he--

33:47.191 --> 33:49.152
Oh. No. I mean, like, months.

33:50.278 --> 33:51.988
This place, man. It's tight.

33:52.113 --> 33:53.823
[chuckles] Yeah.

33:53.990 --> 33:55.992
Actually, could you point me
to the bathroom?

33:57.201 --> 33:59.162
No clue, man. This is my first time here.

33:59.579 --> 34:00.663
It's tight.

34:02.373 --> 34:03.583
Maybe that way?

34:21.517 --> 34:22.518
[car lock chirps]

34:35.782 --> 34:37.533
[tires screeching]

34:38.076 --> 34:39.494
[muffled grunting]

34:48.252 --> 34:49.629
I didn't do anything.

34:50.171 --> 34:52.924
-[officer] Stop resisting.
-It's a bunch of zombie-loving garbage.

34:53.049 --> 34:54.383
[officer] Keep moving...

34:56.260 --> 34:59.055
It's rare that serving a warrant
is that satisfying.

35:00.556 --> 35:02.517
Murder weapon
growing right in his backyard.

35:02.850 --> 35:05.269
-Ivory funnel. Deadly.
-[scoffs]

35:09.690 --> 35:12.110
What are you looking at, ghoul?

35:18.866 --> 35:20.785
[snorting]

35:27.834 --> 35:30.253
-[Moss] That's my wallet.
-Brilliant observation.

35:30.711 --> 35:33.840
Mr. Graham Moss, of 157 Wilburn Avenue.

35:35.967 --> 35:37.426
I hear you work for Renegade.

35:37.885 --> 35:40.138
No. No, I... I don't work for Renegade.

35:40.721 --> 35:41.764
I hear you do.

35:43.015 --> 35:43.891
But it doesn't matter.

35:45.726 --> 35:47.061
You work for us now.

35:50.690 --> 35:51.941
[sighs]

35:57.071 --> 35:58.197
Get the picture?

36:06.330 --> 36:08.708
-[video game bleeping on TV]
-Okay, that's enough screen time,

36:08.791 --> 36:11.711
if Graham isn't here yet,
you should be quietly studying.

36:12.003 --> 36:13.838
-[kid] Just ten more minutes.
-Curtis, where's Graham?

36:13.963 --> 36:15.173
[kid] Come on!

36:15.423 --> 36:16.549
Curtis?

36:18.467 --> 36:19.594
[groans]

36:20.261 --> 36:22.471
Oh, uh, he hasn't come in yet.

36:23.097 --> 36:25.600
Sorry, I was up late tracing
these Z-Watch users.

36:25.766 --> 36:26.767
Do we have coffee?

36:26.851 --> 36:29.520
I don't know, but they should be
quietly studying until...

36:31.939 --> 36:33.983
I know exactly what you were doing.

36:34.317 --> 36:35.735
Mass murder, is what it is.

36:36.319 --> 36:38.946
You do this and zombies are doomed.

36:39.780 --> 36:41.073
[gasps]

36:41.866 --> 36:44.452
-You okay, Liv?
-Fine, fine. I gotta go.

36:44.535 --> 36:46.037
Curtis, teach them something.

36:46.454 --> 36:47.622
-What...
-[door opens]

36:48.789 --> 36:50.750
Hey. So sorry I'm late.

36:50.833 --> 36:52.293
I thought maybe I was being followed,

36:52.376 --> 36:55.713
so I did a whole thing,
but I wasn't, so...

36:55.796 --> 36:57.298
Great. The kids are just there.

37:01.177 --> 37:02.261
I had a vision.

37:02.970 --> 37:05.056
It's too late. Killer's already processed.

37:05.640 --> 37:07.433
Contact was an exact match for Sheldon.

37:07.516 --> 37:10.186
Same prescription, same color.
No backsies.

37:10.436 --> 37:12.438
Melissa lied to us, she did know Sheldon.

37:13.189 --> 37:15.983
I saw her slap the contact
out of Sheldon's eye in the bunker.

37:18.569 --> 37:21.489
So, Sheldon Drake
did not commit this murder?

37:21.614 --> 37:25.243
This particular murder? No.
But a whole slew of future murders.

37:26.118 --> 37:27.328
What's that supposed to mean?

37:27.453 --> 37:30.998
He was paying Cornell for a data-mining
system to ID Seattle zombies.

37:31.082 --> 37:35.086
I'm pretty sure it wasn't to send us all
a nice card for the holidays.

37:35.503 --> 37:36.629
I mean, you heard him.

37:36.963 --> 37:39.173
"All you monsters,
wiped off the face of the earth."

37:39.966 --> 37:42.093
Slow down. A data-mining system?

37:42.635 --> 37:44.095
You know, that zombie doxxing website

37:44.178 --> 37:45.930
that Dead Enders
are creating brick by brick?

37:46.347 --> 37:47.807
-I'm not aware.
-Zombies are.

37:47.890 --> 37:50.685
But Cornell could've ID'd
every zombie in a keystroke.

37:51.060 --> 37:52.103
Think about it.

37:52.186 --> 37:55.439
With his new Pathseeker app,
he knows where everyone drives.

37:55.898 --> 38:00.069
Every visit to a brain dispensary
or tanning salon or zombie-friendly club.

38:00.778 --> 38:02.238
He wants us all dead

38:02.321 --> 38:04.115
and he was paying Cornell
to make it happen.

38:05.366 --> 38:07.368
Maybe it's best he stays in a jail.

38:07.451 --> 38:12.164
Liv, come on. We're not precogs.
That's not how this works.

38:12.248 --> 38:16.043
If Sheldon Drake is free to plot
the mass murder of all of us,

38:16.127 --> 38:18.296
can we say that this works at all?

38:21.674 --> 38:22.800
I think it's great.

38:23.592 --> 38:26.554
-It's funny. It's got, you know--
-It's got heart.

38:27.263 --> 38:28.597
Yeah, it's a good script.

38:29.974 --> 38:31.976
Now, if we just had a cast.

38:32.560 --> 38:35.563
I sent Jimmy the draft,
but didn't hear back.

38:35.646 --> 38:36.647
Oh, we can recast.

38:36.731 --> 38:38.941
I mean, the Yoinks can't be
the only comedy group in Seattle.

38:39.025 --> 38:42.028
Well, there's Laugh Blitz,
which they're not.

38:42.111 --> 38:43.112
Tall Baby are worse.

38:43.195 --> 38:46.657
Well, we don't have much time.
I mean, how bad can Laugh Blitz be?

38:46.741 --> 38:48.242
-[door thuds]
-[Jimmy] The worst.

38:49.577 --> 38:51.078
[Ravi] Jimmy! Wha...

38:51.162 --> 38:52.330
I didn't think you were gonna show.

38:52.413 --> 38:55.374
Well, I didn't think I was gonna get fired
from writing my own show.

38:55.458 --> 38:58.836
-Jimmy, I'm sorry. We just needed some--
-I get it. I understand.

38:59.295 --> 39:01.380
My humor, it's out there.

39:01.464 --> 39:04.842
You know, it's not this
"touchy, feely, everybody hug" stuff.

39:05.634 --> 39:06.886
But I see what you're trying to do and...

39:08.304 --> 39:09.388
Yasmine did a good job.

39:10.306 --> 39:11.474
And I'll be damned

39:11.557 --> 39:14.727
if I'm gonna let Tall Baby come in here
and screw it all up, so...

39:16.187 --> 39:17.188
Let's do this.

39:17.938 --> 39:19.732
Hi, Dave, it's Al.

39:19.815 --> 39:22.693
I'm gonna need an extension
on the DeBeers profile.

39:22.777 --> 39:25.738
Just some intriguing new stuff came up.

39:26.280 --> 39:29.158
I will keep in touch, so, gotta go, bye.

39:32.244 --> 39:34.663
So, how's that
new opening paragraph coming?

39:35.373 --> 39:38.459
I actually don't quite have a handle
on the opening paragraph.

39:38.793 --> 39:40.961
You may be a more complex character
than I thought.

39:42.129 --> 39:43.047
Of course.

39:43.631 --> 39:44.840
Until you know all of me,

39:45.674 --> 39:46.675
you just don't know me.

39:47.051 --> 39:49.303
Then I guess I'll just have to
get to know you even better.

39:49.595 --> 39:50.805
Hmm.

39:51.180 --> 39:52.264
I'll drink to that.

39:58.562 --> 40:00.564
Cornell was a genius.

40:01.232 --> 40:02.483
Like many geniuses...

40:03.609 --> 40:06.737
He wasn't good at processing
the consequences of his work.

40:07.988 --> 40:11.409
I'm not sure that he even
fully appreciated what Sheldon Drake

40:11.951 --> 40:14.412
intended to do with the system
he hired him to make.

40:15.955 --> 40:19.250
For Cornell, it was a payday.

40:20.584 --> 40:22.878
Money, to finish his ark.

40:24.171 --> 40:25.673
He wanted to save humanity.

40:27.341 --> 40:29.051
I wanted to save zombiekind.

40:30.428 --> 40:31.429
But you understand.

40:33.139 --> 40:34.265
Don't you, Renegade?

40:36.642 --> 40:38.561
And the mushrooms in Drake's yard?

40:38.644 --> 40:41.647
I put them there
when I learned he was a suspect.

40:42.106 --> 40:44.024
Hoping I would get him put away.

40:45.151 --> 40:48.154
I wouldn't have lost any sleep
with that man rotting in prison.

40:50.614 --> 40:52.074
Why would you?

40:59.457 --> 41:01.459
