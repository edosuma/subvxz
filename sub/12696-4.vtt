00:07.767 --> 00:10.200
- *

00:13.467 --> 00:15.567
- Hey, Max, did you finally
get your guitar strap fixed?

00:15.667 --> 00:16.933
- Yep, fixed it myself.

00:17.033 --> 00:18.233
Check it out.

00:19.700 --> 00:20.633
Sock and roll!

00:20.733 --> 00:23.867
- *

00:27.167 --> 00:29.800
- Dude, what if that happens
at the talent show?

00:29.900 --> 00:30.767
Buy a new strap.

00:30.867 --> 00:31.800
- I can't buy a new strap.

00:31.900 --> 00:33.167
I'm broke.

00:33.267 --> 00:35.567
But, hey, we'll rock
that talent show

00:35.667 --> 00:37.167
as long as we stay focused.

00:42.300 --> 00:43.200
Guys.

00:43.300 --> 00:45.833
- Ssh, we're trying
to stay focused.

00:45.933 --> 00:47.667
- Oh, no!

00:47.767 --> 00:48.733
My laptop is gone.

00:48.833 --> 00:50.033
I can't find it.

00:50.133 --> 00:51.800
- Uh, maybe you should
retrace your steps.

00:51.900 --> 00:52.633
- Good idea.

00:52.733 --> 00:54.367
Uh, before I was here,

00:54.467 --> 00:56.867
I walked into the boy's bathroom
by mistake.

00:56.967 --> 00:59.067
Sorry, Gideon.

00:59.167 --> 01:00.500
- It's perfectly normal
to go in there

01:00.600 --> 01:02.900
and cry between classes.

01:05.500 --> 01:06.533
Oh.

01:06.633 --> 01:08.567
I remember I put my computer
in my backpack

01:08.667 --> 01:09.833
just before the assembly.

01:09.933 --> 01:11.500
- Someone
probably stole it there.

01:11.600 --> 01:12.833
I know a kid
who got his tablet stolen

01:12.933 --> 01:14.067
at the pep rally last week.

01:14.133 --> 01:15.067
- Bummer.

01:15.100 --> 01:16.133
- Yeah, I know, that's awful.

01:16.233 --> 01:19.467
- No, the kid's name
is Bummer Calloway.

01:19.567 --> 01:20.800
Come on, guys,
let's go rehearse.

01:26.433 --> 01:29.400
That computer
has all of my homework on it.

01:29.500 --> 01:32.933
None of it's right,
but it's done.

01:33.067 --> 01:35.833
- Cherry, I am so sorry.

01:35.933 --> 01:38.200
The Hero League put me in charge
of protecting a hidden villain.

01:38.300 --> 01:40.833
I can't even prevent my bestie
from getting ripped off.

01:40.933 --> 01:44.233
I'm gonna capture this criminal
for you, I promise.

01:44.333 --> 01:44.967
Oh, Max!

01:45.067 --> 01:46.067
I need to talk to you.

01:46.100 --> 01:47.067
- Phoebe, I know
what you're gonna say,

01:47.133 --> 01:49.267
and, no, I did not steal
Cherry's laptop.

01:49.367 --> 01:51.100
- I was just gonna ask
if you've heard anything.

01:51.200 --> 01:52.533
I know you didn't steal it.

01:52.633 --> 01:54.067
You're a jerk,
you're not heartless.

01:54.100 --> 01:55.167
Take that back!

01:55.267 --> 01:57.200
I am totally heartless!

01:57.300 --> 01:58.200
- Would you like
to buy a candy bar

01:58.300 --> 01:59.567
to help save the pandas?

01:59.667 --> 02:02.633
- Oh, how could I say no
to that furry little face?

02:06.767 --> 02:08.067
Hey! Phoebe!

02:08.167 --> 02:09.633
Get back here to admit
I'm heartless!

02:13.067 --> 02:15.567
- * What you see
is not what you get *

02:15.667 --> 02:18.733
* Living our lives
with a secret *

02:18.833 --> 02:21.933
* We fit right in,
bet you'd never guess *

02:22.067 --> 02:25.400
* Because we're living our lives
just like all the rest *

02:25.500 --> 02:29.133
* A picture-perfect family
is what we try to be *

02:29.233 --> 02:32.267
* But closer you might see
the crazy things we do *

02:32.367 --> 02:33.900
* This isn't make-believe

02:34.067 --> 02:35.333
* It's our reality

02:35.433 --> 02:38.333
* Just your average family
trying to be normal *

02:38.433 --> 02:40.100
* And stay out of trouble

02:40.200 --> 02:42.800
* Living a double life *

02:48.867 --> 02:50.900
- And then Phoebe said
I couldn't be the bandit

02:51.067 --> 02:52.367
because I'm not heartless.

02:52.467 --> 02:55.133
- I see, I see.

02:55.233 --> 02:57.233
- And that's why--oh!

03:01.900 --> 03:02.800
What did you do that for?

03:02.900 --> 03:05.933
- For making me
agree with Phoebe!

03:06.067 --> 03:09.133
Those band guys
you hang out with are too nice!

03:09.233 --> 03:10.767
And it's rubbing off on you!

03:10.867 --> 03:12.200
- No, they're not.

03:12.300 --> 03:14.500
And this evil chronicle
of my devious deeds

03:14.600 --> 03:16.600
I'm keeping for Dark Mayhem
is proof.

03:16.700 --> 03:18.667
- This is your evil chronicle.

03:18.767 --> 03:22.100
That is
your stupid band scrapbook!

03:22.200 --> 03:25.967
Look, it's us with Santa.

03:26.067 --> 03:28.300
Ow!

03:28.400 --> 03:30.067
Stop throwing stuff at me.

03:30.133 --> 03:32.767
- Stop scrapbooking!

03:32.867 --> 03:35.433
You need to ditch those
squeaky clean friends of yours.

03:35.533 --> 03:38.133
- Max Thunderman
doesn't have friends.

03:38.233 --> 03:40.200
They're just my band,
nothing us.

03:40.300 --> 03:43.600
- Then lose them
and find some shady characters

03:43.700 --> 03:46.967
to help you fill that chronicle
up with bad stuff!

03:47.067 --> 03:50.100
- Okay, fine, I will.

03:50.200 --> 03:51.467
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

03:51.567 --> 03:53.300
I can help you do bad stuff.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.133
- You know I can't
take you out in public.

03:56.367 --> 03:58.767
You can in my evil stroller.

03:58.867 --> 04:02.067
Push me-e-e-e-e!

04:03.900 --> 04:05.967
- Alright, you guys,
you ready for a snack?

04:06.067 --> 04:07.467
- We actually made our own.

04:09.200 --> 04:10.533
I can't believe it.

04:10.633 --> 04:14.433
- Believe it, baby.

04:14.533 --> 04:17.067
- Hank, the kids
are doing stuff on their own.

04:17.167 --> 04:18.100
- Don't jinx it.

04:18.200 --> 04:20.500
Smile...and back away.

04:23.200 --> 04:26.067
Barb, this family's
on autopilot.

04:26.133 --> 04:28.400
- What are we gonna do
with all this free time?

04:29.500 --> 04:32.900
"Real Super Wives
of Metroburgh"!

04:33.067 --> 04:35.333
We're like
a hundred episodes behind.

04:35.433 --> 04:37.133
We can binge watch them all.

04:37.233 --> 04:38.233
- Why are you
still talking to me?

04:38.333 --> 04:40.700
Turn on the TV!

04:40.800 --> 04:43.733
- *

04:49.700 --> 04:51.533
- Billy!

04:51.633 --> 04:53.600
What are you doing in there?

04:53.700 --> 04:57.800
- Playing hide and seek
with you guys.

04:57.900 --> 05:00.067
- Oh, yeah.

05:00.100 --> 05:02.600
Found you.

05:02.700 --> 05:07.100
- It's been four hours!

05:07.200 --> 05:08.200
- Sorry.

05:08.300 --> 05:09.533
We looked for you for a while,

05:09.633 --> 05:12.400
but then we started
playing outside and we forgot.

05:14.567 --> 05:18.067
- But on the bright side,
you can fit into cupboards.

05:18.133 --> 05:22.300
- Yeah, Billy!

05:22.400 --> 05:25.067
- You guys keep doing this.

05:25.100 --> 05:26.233
This is just like the time

05:26.333 --> 05:28.067
where we were supposed to play
Go Fish.

05:28.100 --> 05:31.967
You two forgot me
and actually went fishing.

05:32.067 --> 05:33.067
- You weren't complaining

05:33.100 --> 05:35.467
when you had
a belly full of flounder.

05:36.767 --> 05:38.800
I can have fun without you, too.

05:38.900 --> 05:41.200
I'm gonna go play
with my other friend.

05:46.400 --> 05:49.367
Um...

05:49.467 --> 05:50.867
Luigi.

05:50.967 --> 05:55.533
Luigi...Marinara.

05:55.633 --> 05:56.833
He's from Italy.

05:56.933 --> 05:58.933
I'm going over to his house
right now for lunch.

05:59.067 --> 06:03.367
We're gonna eat pepperoni
right off the tree.

06:03.467 --> 06:05.800
- *

06:08.367 --> 06:09.767
- Max!

06:09.867 --> 06:11.567
I see you and your friends
signed up for the talent show.

06:11.667 --> 06:12.933
- Oh no,
they're not my friends.

06:13.067 --> 06:15.567
- They've really
cleaned up your act.

06:15.667 --> 06:16.933
- My act is not clean.

06:17.067 --> 06:19.800
- Good talk.

06:19.900 --> 06:22.633
- Even Bradford thinks
I've turned into a nice guy.

06:22.733 --> 06:25.167
I need to find some
shady delinquents...and fast.

06:31.067 --> 06:33.067
- Cherry's computer.

06:33.100 --> 06:35.567
Hello, shady delinquents.

06:36.467 --> 06:38.800
- Ah!

06:38.900 --> 06:41.333
Phoebe, quit creeping up on me
like a creepy creep.

06:41.433 --> 06:43.833
- I'm on the prowl
for bandit suspects.

06:43.933 --> 06:46.167
Oh, those girls look suspicious.

06:46.267 --> 06:47.567
- Ah, forget about those girls.

06:47.667 --> 06:50.800
You asked me if I heard
anything, and I did.

06:50.900 --> 06:54.533
Rumor is Brian Jones
is your man.

06:56.067 --> 06:57.633
- That's the one.

06:57.733 --> 06:59.900
- I'll find out what he's
hiding under those hedgehogs.

07:06.267 --> 07:07.367
- Hey, ladies.

07:07.467 --> 07:08.367
I'm Max Thunderman.

07:08.467 --> 07:09.833
I just wanted to say I'm a fan.

07:09.933 --> 07:11.633
In fact,
I'm in the same line of work.

07:11.733 --> 07:14.667
- And what work
are you talking about?

07:14.767 --> 07:16.800
- Uh, just this.

07:20.567 --> 07:21.600
- Whoa.
- Cool.

07:21.700 --> 07:23.633
- Dessert!

07:25.867 --> 07:28.067
- Well, you definitely
have some skills.

07:28.167 --> 07:29.300
- And you're boy pretty.

07:29.400 --> 07:31.667
I like that.

07:31.767 --> 07:33.133
- I don't
even go to this school.

07:36.200 --> 07:38.233
- Come on, we'll let you
hang for a while.

07:43.600 --> 07:44.167
- Max!

07:44.267 --> 07:45.833
- Ah!

07:45.933 --> 07:48.267
Why is everybody creeping?

07:48.367 --> 07:50.833
- Dude, we got something
for you.

07:50.933 --> 07:53.067
- Oh guys,
you can't be buying me stuff.

07:53.767 --> 07:54.767
You're our friend.

07:54.867 --> 07:56.067
Best-in friend-zins.

07:56.167 --> 07:57.500
- Oh, no hugs.

07:57.600 --> 07:58.700
And not best-in friend-zins.

07:58.800 --> 08:00.900
We're just a band.

08:01.067 --> 08:03.200
Ouch.

08:04.300 --> 08:05.400
- What are you
talking about, man?

08:05.500 --> 08:06.800
We're all friends.

08:06.900 --> 08:07.867
And you started
the gift giving

08:07.967 --> 08:11.133
when you made us
these scrapbooks.

08:11.233 --> 08:12.167
- Give me those.

08:12.267 --> 08:14.567
Max Thunderman
doesn't have friends.

08:14.667 --> 08:16.333
And now he doesn't have a band.

08:16.433 --> 08:17.900
I'm out.

08:23.333 --> 08:25.067
What just happened?

08:26.533 --> 08:27.767
I don't know.

08:27.867 --> 08:32.567
But I'll be in the bathroom.

08:32.667 --> 08:34.533
- Okay, Chloe,
got all your pads on.

08:34.633 --> 08:38.667
- Let's roll!

08:38.767 --> 08:41.100
- Whoa, look
who's hanging out again.

08:41.200 --> 08:43.067
- We're just going
scooting down by the--

08:43.133 --> 08:47.233
- Excuse me,
my friend is calling.

08:47.333 --> 08:48.367
Hey, Luigi.

08:48.467 --> 08:49.833
Qué pasta?

08:49.933 --> 08:53.433
That's Italian
for "How's it going?"

08:53.533 --> 08:56.100
Sure, I'll come over again.

08:56.200 --> 08:58.967
Hasta lasagna.

08:59.067 --> 09:01.567
- Oh, hey,
when do I get to meet Luigi?

09:01.667 --> 09:02.800
- Whenever you want.

09:05.533 --> 09:06.233
- Great.

09:06.333 --> 09:07.333
Bring him over tomorrow.

09:12.300 --> 09:13.233
- He'll be here.

09:13.333 --> 09:14.767
- MAX'S MIND:
What is wrong with me?

09:17.867 --> 09:19.100
- WOMAN ON TV:
I'm keeping it real.

09:19.200 --> 09:21.867
Oh, don't you fly away from me
when I'm talking to you.

09:21.967 --> 09:23.700
- Oh, no, she didn't!

09:23.800 --> 09:27.100
- Oh, yes, she did!

09:27.200 --> 09:32.167
I didn't think it was possible
to watch 67 episodes in 1 day.

09:32.267 --> 09:32.867
- It's not.

09:32.967 --> 09:35.267
It's been two days.

09:35.367 --> 09:37.567
Watching TV inside this long
isn't good for us.

09:37.667 --> 09:39.133
- Oh, I totally agree.

09:39.233 --> 09:41.867
We need fresh air.

09:41.967 --> 09:43.500
Oh, no, she didn't!

09:43.600 --> 09:45.200
- Oh, oh, yes, she did!

09:48.900 --> 09:51.300
- So, Max, you ready
for your first big heist?

09:51.400 --> 09:52.733
- I was born ready.

09:52.833 --> 09:54.433
- I was born in the woods.

09:58.500 --> 10:00.900
- Phoebe, I thought you were
gonna shave off his eyebrows

10:01.000 --> 10:02.200
to see what he was hiding.

10:02.300 --> 10:03.400
- I did.

10:03.500 --> 10:06.400
Turns out
they grow back in a day.

10:06.500 --> 10:09.200
Look, Cherry, I'm so sorry
I haven't found your laptop yet.

10:09.300 --> 10:13.667
It's like whoever stole it
has a guardian angel.

10:13.767 --> 10:15.067
But I'm not gonna quit, okay?

10:15.167 --> 10:17.333
The bandit hit the assembly
and the pep rally.

10:17.433 --> 10:21.133
So my guess is
he's gonna show up here tonight.

10:21.233 --> 10:22.467
- Of course.

10:22.567 --> 10:24.567
- Which is why we're gonna
go into the auditorium early

10:24.667 --> 10:26.000
to be there to catch him.

10:26.100 --> 10:28.767
Come on.

10:28.867 --> 10:31.300
- Wonder which one's the dummy.

10:31.400 --> 10:32.500
Whoa!

10:32.600 --> 10:34.000
Performers only, Phoebe.

10:34.100 --> 10:36.833
- Actually, Cherry and I
were hoping to enter

10:36.933 --> 10:38.333
as a last-minute act.

10:38.433 --> 10:41.033
- Annoying me is not a talent.

10:41.133 --> 10:45.000
- Lucky for you,
we have many talents.

10:45.100 --> 10:50.567
And we...are going over there
right now to pick one.

10:52.033 --> 10:53.500
- I guess we have to
come up with an act.

10:53.600 --> 10:54.967
The only other way
to get backstage

10:55.067 --> 10:58.233
is through the ceiling vent,
and only a fool would try that.

10:58.333 --> 11:01.633
- Ugh!

11:01.733 --> 11:03.167
I'm a genius.

11:07.067 --> 11:10.467
- All right, Max, you're about
to become one of us.

11:10.567 --> 11:14.367
- Then you'll be the weird one.

11:16.833 --> 11:20.067
We're gonna steal
that popcorn cart behind them.

11:21.267 --> 11:22.167
- For a second
I thought you were gonna say

11:22.267 --> 11:23.233
we're stealing
all their equipment.

11:24.900 --> 11:27.967
- That's a much better idea.

11:28.067 --> 11:29.467
- Good job, the weird one.

11:34.200 --> 11:35.933
- Stealing their equipment
will be like taking a fancy car

11:36.067 --> 11:37.933
from a helpless old man.

11:39.933 --> 11:44.633
- Enjoying his bus pass.

11:44.733 --> 11:45.833
- Hey!

11:45.933 --> 11:47.533
Aren't those guys your friends?

11:50.800 --> 11:51.633
- No.

11:51.733 --> 11:54.800
I have no idea who they are.

11:54.900 --> 11:56.700
- Guys, guys, stop!

11:56.800 --> 11:58.933
Look, we're all upset
about losing Max.

11:59.067 --> 12:01.367
- Uh, different Max.

12:01.467 --> 12:03.967
- We have to move on
and forget about Max Thunderman.

12:04.067 --> 12:05.400
- Different Max Thunderman.

12:11.533 --> 12:13.433
- We can't steal anything
'til we figure out

12:13.533 --> 12:15.200
how to get rid of that guy.

12:15.300 --> 12:16.933
- Gideon has
a lot of weaknesses--

12:17.067 --> 12:19.467
'80s hip hop, girls,
food court samples.

12:21.733 --> 12:22.433
- Yeah.

12:22.533 --> 12:23.600
- I got this.

12:28.533 --> 12:29.300
Hey.

12:29.400 --> 12:32.367
- Yes.

12:32.467 --> 12:34.600
- *

12:35.800 --> 12:37.800
- Ladies and gentlemen!

12:37.900 --> 12:43.400
The gorgeous women of magic
or GWAM.

12:43.500 --> 12:46.500
- That's definitely
not what we discussed.

12:46.600 --> 12:50.333
Anyway, prepare to be amazed.

12:50.433 --> 12:53.400
Really?

12:53.500 --> 12:58.767
- Principal Bradford, can I
interest you in a Cherry float?

12:58.867 --> 13:00.167
- My brother was a magician.

13:00.267 --> 13:03.733
He turned my girlfriend
into his wife.

13:03.833 --> 13:09.067
So unless you can pull Valerie
out of that hat, go away.

13:09.100 --> 13:10.700
- Principal Bradford, wait!

13:10.800 --> 13:12.367
- Ugh!

13:12.467 --> 13:13.833
Ow!

13:13.933 --> 13:14.800
Ow!

13:14.900 --> 13:17.967
The pain is not an illusion.

13:18.067 --> 13:19.467
- I'm sorry, Cherry.

13:19.567 --> 13:22.533
First I let your laptop
get stolen, and then I drop you.

13:22.633 --> 13:27.767
Maybe I should quit being
a superhero and focus on GWAM?

13:27.867 --> 13:30.900
- Gideon, you are
so sweet...and hilarious.

13:33.500 --> 13:36.500
Gideon is neither
of those things.

13:36.600 --> 13:37.700
Magic's out, Cherry.

13:37.800 --> 13:39.700
Saving the world is back in.

13:39.800 --> 13:42.233
- *

13:42.333 --> 13:44.233
- So Luigi
will be here any minute.

13:44.333 --> 13:46.067
- Oh, this is gonna be fun.

13:46.133 --> 13:49.733
- Or a complete disaster.

13:49.833 --> 13:52.300
I'm gonna go change
into my good socks.

14:04.967 --> 14:06.400
You must-a be Nora.

14:06.500 --> 14:08.100
I'm Luigi.

14:08.200 --> 14:10.233
Nice-a to meet you.

14:18.467 --> 14:21.067
- *

14:25.567 --> 14:28.500
- You know, you guys are
a terrible influence on me.

14:28.600 --> 14:29.567
I'd like to say thank you.

14:37.233 --> 14:39.233
- A new guitar strap.

14:39.333 --> 14:40.767
Oh.

14:40.867 --> 14:45.467
"To Max, you're low on cash,
but you're not low on friends."

14:45.567 --> 14:46.933
- Pfh, nerd love.

14:49.067 --> 14:50.233
I'll take that.

14:50.333 --> 14:52.433
The dog I stole
needs a new leash.

14:52.533 --> 14:54.200
- Give me that back.

14:54.300 --> 14:56.867
- I thought you said
they weren't your friends.

14:56.967 --> 14:59.500
- Well, they are.

14:59.600 --> 15:02.133
At least they were.

15:02.233 --> 15:03.600
- Some girl was following me.

15:03.700 --> 15:05.633
I lost her, but we should get
this stuff back to the hideout.

15:06.900 --> 15:08.133
I don't think so.

15:08.233 --> 15:09.167
If you wanna steal
from my friends,

15:09.267 --> 15:10.667
you're gonna
have to go through me.

15:10.767 --> 15:11.800
- Okie-dokie.

15:11.900 --> 15:13.767
- Ugh!

15:15.933 --> 15:19.933
You don't
even go to this school!

15:20.067 --> 15:22.333
Where's Phoebe when I need her?

15:22.433 --> 15:25.200
- Oh!

15:25.300 --> 15:26.067
Max!

15:26.167 --> 15:27.067
What are you doing here?

15:27.167 --> 15:28.433
Where's that girl
I was following?

15:28.533 --> 15:29.467
- Jay ran out
with the other two

15:29.567 --> 15:31.067
and all the band's stuff
they stole.

15:31.167 --> 15:33.067
- So they are the bandits.

15:33.133 --> 15:34.267
Wait, why do you know them?

15:34.367 --> 15:36.067
Are you helping them?

15:36.100 --> 15:39.400
Are you one of them?

15:39.500 --> 15:40.533
- No.

15:40.633 --> 15:41.533
I don't know.

15:41.633 --> 15:43.100
Kinda.

15:43.200 --> 15:44.933
- Max, I can't believe
you did this.

15:45.067 --> 15:46.233
And to your own friends.

15:46.333 --> 15:47.700
- Well, I tried to stop them.

15:47.800 --> 15:50.400
After I gave them the idea,
got them backstage,

15:50.500 --> 15:52.067
distracted Gideon,
loaded all their equipment.

15:52.167 --> 15:55.067
What have I done?

15:55.133 --> 15:56.600
- You messed up, as usual.

15:56.700 --> 15:59.367
Now just stay out of my way so
I can finally catch these girls.

15:59.467 --> 16:00.167
- No, wait.

16:00.267 --> 16:01.600
I'm going with you.

16:01.700 --> 16:03.533
Right after I pop
this bad boy back in.

16:03.633 --> 16:05.067
Oh.

16:05.167 --> 16:07.533
Help me, just pop it, come on.

16:07.633 --> 16:08.767
Ah!

16:12.067 --> 16:13.433
- I'm never doing that again.

16:18.767 --> 16:21.067
Isn't the Billy a great kid?

16:21.100 --> 16:23.233
Who don't want to play with him?

16:23.333 --> 16:24.933
- Sounds like you know him
pretty well.

16:25.067 --> 16:28.467
It's
almost like we're the same boy.

16:28.567 --> 16:30.867
Excusé, I need to go bathroom.

16:37.433 --> 16:39.500
- So, how do you guys
like Luigi?

16:45.267 --> 16:47.267
- He sure does go
to the bathroom a lot.

16:47.367 --> 16:52.733
- Well, as they say in Italy,
tiny bladder, huge heart.

16:52.833 --> 16:55.333
I'll go check on him.

16:55.433 --> 16:57.233
- Do you see
what's going on here?

16:57.333 --> 17:01.467
- Billy is Luigi.

17:01.567 --> 17:02.833
- I think we hurt his feelings

17:02.933 --> 17:05.367
because we've been playing
together so much without him.

17:05.467 --> 17:07.333
- A cookie will fix it.

17:07.433 --> 17:09.600
- Oh, that's so sweet.

17:09.700 --> 17:10.900
- No, for me.

17:14.533 --> 17:17.967
- So, Luigi,
do you have a little sister?

17:18.067 --> 17:21.833
No, I just got my friend Billy.

17:21.933 --> 17:23.967
- I love my little sister Chloe.

17:24.067 --> 17:26.400
And just because I like
to play with her

17:26.500 --> 17:29.333
doesn't mean I don't like
playing with Billy, too.

17:29.433 --> 17:31.200
He's my best friend.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.100
I hope he knows that.

17:33.200 --> 17:34.667
Really?

17:34.767 --> 17:38.200
That touches Luigi's huge heart.

17:38.300 --> 17:40.100
I'm gonna go tell Billy
right now.

17:40.200 --> 17:41.700
Excusé.

17:50.100 --> 17:51.367
- For being a good sister.

17:55.433 --> 17:58.467
I found it like that.

17:58.567 --> 17:59.500
- Thanks.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.567
Now who wants to go
play laser tag?

18:01.667 --> 18:02.733
- BOTH: Me!

18:06.600 --> 18:07.600
- MAN ON TV: Coming up next,

18:07.700 --> 18:11.067
the final episode
that changes everything.

18:11.100 --> 18:12.733
- Barb, we earned this.

18:19.367 --> 18:20.767
- BILLY: You hit mom and dad!

18:20.867 --> 18:22.267
Run!

18:24.433 --> 18:26.133
- Thinking we should
check on the kids.

18:26.233 --> 18:28.667
- Don't quit on me now, Barb.

18:28.767 --> 18:32.533
- *

18:40.800 --> 18:41.900
I don't get it.

18:42.067 --> 18:42.733
The tracks led here.

18:42.833 --> 18:43.567
I'm sure of it.

18:43.667 --> 18:45.100
- Look for anything unusual.

18:45.200 --> 18:47.700
In an evil lair,
nothing is as it seems.

18:47.800 --> 18:48.867
- Ha.

18:48.967 --> 18:51.900
What do you think
this dead possum really is?

18:52.067 --> 18:52.933
Dead possum.

18:53.067 --> 18:54.367
- Ah!

18:56.867 --> 18:57.867
- Check this out.

18:57.967 --> 18:59.500
This looks like an old computer.

18:59.600 --> 19:01.700
But I bet if I just push--

19:06.300 --> 19:07.767
- PHOEBE: You did it!

19:07.867 --> 19:09.367
Cherry's laptop.

19:09.467 --> 19:11.367
Uh, and look at all this stuff.

19:11.467 --> 19:14.233
- You mean,
look at all our stuff.

19:14.333 --> 19:16.067
- We're taking you bandits down.

19:16.167 --> 19:17.900
- But, first,
we're taking you up.

19:18.067 --> 19:19.500
Max,
we can't use our powers

19:19.600 --> 19:20.833
and risk being exposed.

19:20.933 --> 19:21.967
We have to fight fair.

19:26.567 --> 19:29.900
But they probably won't.

19:30.067 --> 19:31.900
- Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, ah!

19:32.067 --> 19:35.500
- *

19:35.600 --> 19:37.800
- You're mine, pretty boy.

19:37.900 --> 19:40.233
- Eraser clap!

19:40.333 --> 19:44.967
- *

19:45.067 --> 19:46.100
- Okay, this is officially

19:46.200 --> 19:47.700
the weirdest fight
I've ever been in.

19:56.867 --> 19:57.700
- Ha!

20:01.733 --> 20:05.067
- Ow!

20:07.967 --> 20:11.067
- *

20:19.900 --> 20:23.233
- So...these are
your new friends, huh?

20:23.333 --> 20:25.200
- No.

20:25.300 --> 20:25.900
I don't know.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.467
Kind of.

20:28.967 --> 20:32.567
- *

20:35.867 --> 20:37.000
- Dude, sweet-aches!

20:37.100 --> 20:38.333
Our stuff!

20:38.433 --> 20:39.700
We thought it was stolen.

20:39.800 --> 20:40.500
- It was.

20:40.600 --> 20:42.100
But Max and I got it back.

20:42.200 --> 20:43.133
- I had to do something

20:43.233 --> 20:44.900
to make up for bailing
on you guys.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.233
Look, I'm sorry.

20:47.333 --> 20:49.767
You guys are my friends,
and I threw it away.

20:49.867 --> 20:53.267
I don't deserve you
or this strap.

20:53.367 --> 20:56.067
- Well...Wolfgang
did stay up all night

20:56.167 --> 20:57.733
sewing your name on it.

20:57.833 --> 21:00.800
- Ugh, Wolfgang.

21:00.900 --> 21:04.200
- Don't be modest, Wolfgang,
your stitching is flawless.

21:04.300 --> 21:08.600
But since we can't return it,
you might as well keep it.

21:08.700 --> 21:11.200
- Why are we playing
these games?

21:11.300 --> 21:15.800
We want you back
in the band, Max!

21:15.900 --> 21:17.133
- Thanks, guys.

21:17.233 --> 21:18.400
Best-in friend-zins.

21:18.500 --> 21:21.700
- Max is back!

21:21.800 --> 21:24.500
- And I believe
this belongs to you.

21:24.600 --> 21:28.667
Oh my gosh,
you did it!

21:28.767 --> 21:31.933
I have my own private superhero.

21:32.067 --> 21:36.233
Did you by any chance
find my shark on a stick?

21:36.333 --> 21:39.167
- *

21:40.867 --> 21:41.467
- Yep.

21:41.567 --> 21:43.633
And they're good.

21:43.733 --> 21:45.400
- Hate to admit it,
but if we want to beat them,

21:45.500 --> 21:46.867
we're gonna need some flair.

21:46.967 --> 21:49.533
- I think Cherry and I
can help you with that.

21:49.633 --> 21:53.833
Have you boys ever
heard of GWAM?

21:53.933 --> 21:58.700
- *

22:11.267 --> 22:16.467
- *
